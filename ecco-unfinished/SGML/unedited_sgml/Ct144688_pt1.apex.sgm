<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF My Own Times.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="preface">
<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_I AM now beginning to review and write over again the hi&s;tory of my own time, which I fir&s;t undertook twenty years ago <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This hi&s;tory he writ &s;ome time before the year 1705, but how long, he has not any where told, only it appears it was then fini&s;h'd, becau&s;e in the beginning of the reign of King <HI>Wil|liam</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> he dates the continuation of his hi&s;tory on the fir&s;t day of <HI>May,</HI> 1705.</NOTE>, and have been con|tinuing it from year to year ever &s;ince: And I &s;ee &s;ome rea&s;on to review it all. I had while I was very young a greater knowledge of affairs than is u&s;ual at that age; for my father, who had been en|gaged in great friend&s;hips with men of both &s;ides, living then
<PB N="2" REF="18">
retired from all bu&s;ine&s;s, as he took my education wholly into his own hands, &s;o he took a &s;ort of plea&s;ure to relate to me the &s;eries of all publick affairs. And as he was a man &s;o eminent for probity and true piety that I had all rea&s;on to believe him, &s;o I &s;aw &s;uch an impartial &s;en&s;e of things in him, that I had as little rea&s;on to doubt his judgment as his &s;incerity. For tho' he adhered &s;o firmly to the King and his &s;ide, that he was the &s;ingular in&s;tance in <HI>Scotland</HI> of a man of &s;ome note who from the beginning to the end of the war never once owned or &s;ub|mitted to the new form of Government &s;et up all that while; yet he did very freely complain of the errours of the King's Go|vernment, and of the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Scotland.</HI> So that upon this foundation I &s;et out at fir&s;t to look into the &s;ecret conduct of affairs among us.</P>
<P>I fell into great acquaintance and friend&s;hips with &s;everal per&s;ons who either were or had been Mini&s;ters of &s;tate, from whom when the &s;ecret of affairs was over I &s;tudied to know as many particulars as I could draw from them. I &s;aw a great deal more among the Papers of the Dukes of <HI>Hamilton</HI> than was properly a part of their memoirs, or fit to be told at that time: For when a licence was to be obtained, and a work was to be publi&s;hed fit for that family to own, things foreign to their Mi|ni&s;try, or hurtful to any other families, were not to be inter|mixed with the account I then gave of the late wars. And now for above thirty years I have lived in &s;uch intimacy with all who have had the chief conduct of affairs, and have been &s;o much tru&s;ted, and on &s;o many important occa&s;ions employed by them, that I have been able to penetrate far into the true &s;ecrets of coun&s;els and de&s;igns.</P>
<P>This made me twenty years ago write down a relation of all that I had known to that time: Where I was in the dark, I pa&s;t over all, and only opened tho&s;e tran&s;actions that I had parti|cular occa&s;ions to know. My chief de&s;ign in writing was to give a true view of men and of coun&s;els, leaving publick tran&s;|actions to Gazetts and the publick hi&s;torians of the times. I writ with a de&s;ign to make both my &s;elf and my readers wi&s;er and better, and to lay open the good and bad of all &s;ides and parties, as clearly and impartially as I my &s;elf under&s;tood it, con|cealing nothing that I thought fit to be known, and repre&s;en|ting things in their natural colours without art or di&s;gui&s;e, without any regard to kindred or friends, to parties or intere&s;ts: For I do &s;olemnly &s;ay this to the world, and make my humble
<PB N="3" REF="19">
appeal upon it to the great God of truth, that I tell the truth on all occa&s;ions, as fully and freely as upon my be&s;t inquiry I have been able to find it out. Where things appear doubt|ful I deliver them with the &s;ame incertainty to the world.</P>
<P>Some may perhaps think that in&s;tead of favouring my own profe&s;&s;ion, I have been more &s;evere upon them than was need|ful. But my zeal for the true intere&s;t of Religion and of the Clergy made me more careful to undeceive good and well meaning men of my own order and profe&s;&s;ion for the future, and to deliver them from common prejudices and mi&s;taken no|tions, than to hide or excu&s;e the faults of tho&s;e who will be perhaps gone off the &s;tage before this work appear on it. I have given the characters of men very impartially and copiou&s;|ly; for nothing guides ones judgment more truly in a relation of matters of fact, than the knowing the tempers and princi|ples of the chief actors.</P>
<P>If I have dwelt too long on the affairs of <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;ome al|lowance is to be made to the affection all men bear to their native countrey. I alter nothing of what I wrote in the fir&s;t draught of this work, only I have left out a great deal that was per&s;onal to my &s;elf, and to tho&s;e I am de&s;cended from: So that this is upon the matter the &s;ame work with very little change made in it.</P>
<P>I look on the perfecting of this work, and the carrying it on thro' the remaining part of my life, as the greate&s;t &s;ervice I can do to God and to the world; and therefore I &s;et about it with great care and caution. For I reckon a lie in hi&s;tory to be as much a greater &s;in than a lie in common di&s;cour&s;e, as the one is like to be more la&s;ting and more generally known than the other. I find that the long experience I have had of the ba&s;ene&s;s, the malice, and the fal&s;hood of mankind, has inclined me to be apt to think generally the wor&s;t both of men and of parties: and indeed the peevi&s;hne&s;s, the ill nature, and the ambition of many clergymen has &s;harpned my &s;pirits per|haps too much again&s;t them: So I warn my reader to take all that I &s;ay on the&s;e heads with &s;ome grains of allowance, tho' I have watched over my &s;elf and my pen &s;o carefully that I hope there is no great occa&s;ion for this apology.</P>
<P>I have &s;hewed this hi&s;tory to &s;everal of my friends, who were either very partial to me, or they e&s;teemed that this work (chief|ly
<PB N="4" REF="20">
when it &s;hould be over and over again retouched and po|li&s;hed by me, which very probably I &s;hall be doing as long as I live) might prove of &s;ome u&s;e to the world. I have on de&s;ign avoided all laboured periods or artificial &s;trains, and have writ in as clear and plain a &s;tyle as was po&s;&s;ible, chu&s;ing rather a co|pious enlargement, than a dark conci&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>And now, O my God, the God of my life, and of all my mercies, I offer this work to thee, to who&s;e honour it is chiefly intended; that thereby I may awaken the world to ju&s;t reflecti|ons on their own errours and follies, and call on them to ac|knowledge thy Providence, to adore it, and ever to depend on it.</P>

<P>_THE mi&s;chiefs of civil wars are &s;o great and la&s;t|ing, and the effects of them branching out by many accidents, that were not thought on at fir&s;t much le&s;s intended, into &s;uch mi&s;chie|vous con&s;equences, that I have thought it an enquiry that might be of great u&s;e both to Prince and People, to look carefully into the fir&s;t beginnings and oc|ca&s;ions of them, to ob&s;erve their progre&s;s, and the errors of

both hands, the provocations that were given, and the jealou|&s;ies that were rai&s;ed by the&s;e, together with the exce&s;&s;es into which both &s;ides have run by turns. And tho' the wars be over long ago, yet &s;ince they have left among us &s;o many &s;eeds of la&s;ting feuds and animo&s;ities, which upon every turn are apt to ferment and to break out of new, it will be an u&s;eful as well as a plea&s;ant enquiry to look back to the fir&s;t original of them, and to ob&s;erve by what degrees and accidents they gathered &s;trength, and at la&s;t broke forth into a flame.</P>
<P>The Reformation of <HI>Scotland</HI> was popular and parliamentary: <NOTE PLACE="marg">The di&s;tract|ions du|ring King <HI>James</HI>'s mi|nority.</NOTE> The Crown was, during that time, either on the head of a Queen that was ab&s;ent, or of a King that was an infant. During his minority matters were carried on by the &s;everal Regents, &s;o as was mo&s;t agreeable to the prevailing humour of the Nation. But when King <HI>James</HI> grew to be of age, he found two parties in the Kingdom. The one was of tho&s;e who wi&s;hed well to the intere&s;t of the Queen his Mother, then a pri&s;oner in <HI>England:</HI> The&s;e were either profe&s;&s;ed Papi&s;ts, or men believed to be in|different as to all religions. The re&s;t were her inveterate ene|mies, zealous for the Reformation, and fixed in a dependence on the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and in a jealou&s;y of <HI>France.</HI> When that King &s;aw that tho&s;e who were mo&s;t in his intere&s;ts were likewi&s;e jealous of his authority, and apt to encroach upon it, he hearkned fir&s;t to the in&s;inuations of his Mother's party, who were always infu&s;ing in him a jealou&s;y of the&s;e his friends; &s;ay|ing, that by ruining his Mother, and &s;etting him in her room while a year old, they had ruined monarchy, and made the Crown &s;ubject and precarious; and had put him in a very un|natural po&s;ture, of being &s;eized of his Mother's Crown while &s;he was in exile and a pri&s;oner; adding, that he was but a King in name, the power being in the hands of tho&s;e who were un|der the management of the Queen of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Their in&s;inuations would have been of le&s;s force, if the Hou&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">The practi|ces of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Gui&s;e.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> who were his Co&s;in Germans, had not been engaged in great de&s;igns, of transferring the Crown of <HI>France</HI> from the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI> to them&s;elves; in order to which it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to embroil <HI>England,</HI> and to draw the King of <HI>Scotland</HI> into their intere&s;ts. So under the pretence of keeping up the old alliances between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> they &s;ent creatures of their own to be Amba&s;&s;adours there; and they al&s;o &s;ent a graceful young man, who, as he was the King's neare&s;t kin&s;|man by his father, was of &s;o agreeable a temper that he be|came his favourite, and was made by him Duke of <HI>Lenox.</HI> He
<PB N="7" REF="23">
was known to be a Papi&s;t, tho' he pretended he changed his religion, and became in profe&s;&s;ion a Prote&s;tant.</P>
<P>The Court of <HI>England</HI> di&s;covered all the&s;e artifices of the <HI>Gui|&s;ians,</HI> who were then the mo&s;t implacable enemies of the Re|formation, and were managing all that train of plots again&s;t Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> that in conclu&s;ion proved fatal to the Queen of <HI>Scots.</HI> And when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters &s;aw the inclinations of the young King lay &s;o &s;trongly that way, that all their ap|plications to gain him were ineffectual, they infu&s;ed &s;uch a jea|lou&s;y of him into all their party in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that both Nobility and Clergy were much allarmed at it.</P>
<P>But King <HI>James</HI> learnt early that piece of King-craft, of di&s;gui&s;ing, or at lea&s;t denying every thing that was ob&s;erved in his behaviour that gave offence.</P>
<P>The main in&s;tance in which the <HI>French</HI> management appear|ed, was that he could not be prevailed on to enter into any trea|ty of marriage. It was not &s;afe to talk of marrying a Papi&s;t; and as long as the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> lived, the King, tho' then three and twenty and the only per&s;on of his family, would heark|en to no propo&s;ition for marrying a Prote&s;tant.</P>
<P>But when the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> was killed at <HI>Blois,</HI> and that <NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>James</HI> in the inte|re&s;t of <HI>Eng|land.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Henry</HI> the third was murdered &s;oon after, &s;o that <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth came in his room, King <HI>James</HI> was no more in a <HI>French</HI> management: So pre&s;ently after he married a Daughter of <HI>Den|mark,</HI> and ever after that he was wholly managed by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and her Mini&s;ters. I have &s;een many letters among <HI>Wal&s;ingham's</HI> papers that di&s;cover the commerce between the Hou&s;e of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> and him: But the mo&s;t valuable of the&s;e is a long paper of in&s;tructions to one Sir <HI>Richard Wigmore,</HI> a great man for hunting, and for all &s;uch &s;ports, to which King <HI>James</HI> was out of mea&s;ure addicted. The Queen affronted him publickly: Upon which he pretended he could live no longer in <HI>England,</HI> and therefore withdrew to <HI>Scotland.</HI> But all this was a contri|vance of <HI>Wal&s;ingham</HI>'s, who thought him a fit per&s;on to get into that King's favour: So that affront was de&s;igned to give him the more credit. He was very particularly in&s;tructed in all the proper methods to gain upon the King's confidence, and to ob&s;erve and give an account of all he &s;aw in him; which he did very faithfully. By the&s;e in&s;tructions it appears that <HI>Wal|&s;ingham</HI> thought that King was either inclined to turn Papi&s;t, or to be of no religion. And when the Court of <HI>England</HI> &s;aw that they could not depend on him, they rai&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible op|po&s;ition to him in <HI>Scotland,</HI> infu&s;ing &s;trong jealou&s;ies into tho&s;e who were enough inclined to receive them.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="24">
This is the great defect that runs thro' Archbi&s;hop <HI>Spot&s;wood</HI>'s hi&s;tory, where much of the rude oppo&s;ition that King met with, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A cen&s;ure of <HI>Spot&s;|wood</HI>'s hi&s;|tory.</NOTE> particularly from the A&s;&s;emblies of the <HI>Kirk,</HI> is &s;et forth; but the true ground of all the jealou&s;ies they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with is &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed by him. After his marriage they &s;tudied to remove the&s;e &s;u&s;picions all that was po&s;&s;ible; and he granted the <HI>Kirk</HI> all the laws they de&s;ired, and got his temporal authority to be better e&s;tabli&s;hed than it was before: Yet as the jealou&s;ies of his fick|lene&s;s in religion were never quite removed, &s;o they gave him many new di&s;gu&s;ts: They wrought in him a mo&s;t inveterate hatred of presbytery, and of the power of the <HI>Kirk;</HI> and he fearing an oppo&s;ition in his &s;ucceeding to the Crown of <HI>En|gland,</HI> from the Papi&s;t party, which, tho' it had little &s;trength in the Hou&s;e of Commons, yet was very great in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and was very con&s;iderable in all the northern parts, and among the body of the people, employed &s;everal per&s;ons who were known to be Papi&s;ts tho' they complied outwardly. The chief of the&s;e were <HI>Elphin&s;lon,</HI> Secretary of State, whom he made Lord <HI>Balmerinoch;</HI> and <HI>Sea&s;on,</HI> afterwards Chancellour and Earl of <HI>Dunfermling.</HI> By their means he &s;tudied to a&s;&s;ure <NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>James</HI> $span$ed to $word$ the Pa|$span$s.</NOTE> the Papi&s;ts that he would connive at them. A letter was al&s;o writ to the Pope by him giving a&s;&s;urance of this, which when it came to be publi&s;hed by <HI>Bellarmin,</HI> upon the pro&s;ecution of the recu&s;ants after the di&s;covery of the Gunpowder Plot, <HI>Bal|merinoch</HI> did affirm, that he out of zeal to the King's &s;ervice got his hand to it, having put it in the bundle of papers that were &s;igned in cour&s;e without the King's knowing any thing of it. Yet when that di&s;covery drew no other &s;everity but the turning him out of office, and the pa&s;&s;ing a &s;entence condemn|ing him to die for it (which was pre&s;ently pardoned, and he was after a &s;hort confinement re&s;tored to his liberty,) all men believed that the King knew of the letter, and that the pre|tended confe&s;&s;ion of the Secretary was only collu&s;ion to lay the jealou&s;ies of the King's favouring Popery, which &s;till hung up|on him notwith&s;tanding his writing on the <HI>Revelation,</HI> and his affecting to enter on all occa&s;ions into controver&s;y, a&s;&s;erting in particular that the Pope was Antichri&s;t.</P>
<P>As he took the&s;e methods to manage the Popi&s;h party, he <NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ to &s;e $span$ the $span$on $word$ the $span$wn o$ <HI>$span$nd</HI></NOTE> was much more careful to &s;ecure to him&s;elf the body of the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> nation. <HI>$span$ll,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> Secretary to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> entred into a particular confidence with him: And this was managed by his Amba&s;&s;ador <HI>Bruce,</HI> a younger bro|ther of a noble family in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who carried the matter with &s;uch addre&s;s and &s;eciecy, that all the great Men of <HI>England,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="25">
without knowing of one another's doing it, and without the Queen's &s;u&s;pecting any thing concerning it, &s;igned in writing an engagement to a&s;&s;ert and &s;tand by the King of <HI>Scots</HI> right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. This great &s;ervice was rewarded by making him Ma&s;ter of the Rolls, and a Peer of <HI>Scotland:</HI> And as the King did rai&s;e <HI>Cecil</HI> and his friends to the greate&s;t po&s;ts and digni|ties, &s;o he rai&s;ed <HI>Bruce</HI>'s family here in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>When that King came to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> he di&s;covered <NOTE PLACE="marg">That King's errours in Govern|ment</NOTE> his hatred to the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Kirk on many occa&s;ions, in which he gratified his re&s;entment without con&s;ulting his intere&s;ts. He ought to have put his utmo&s;t &s;trength to the fini&s;hing what he but faintly begun for the union of both Kingdoms, which was lo&s;t by his unrea&s;onable partiality in pretending that <HI>Scotland</HI> ought to be con&s;idered in this union as the third part of the I&s;le of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> if not more. So high a demand ruined the de&s;ign. But when that failed, he &s;hould then have &s;tudied to keep the affections of that Nation firm to him: And certainly he, being &s;ecure of that Kingdom, might have &s;o managed matters, as to have prevented that disjointing which happened afterwards both in his own reign, and more tragically in his &s;on's. He thought to effect this by his profu&s;e bounty to many of the Nobility of that Kingdom, and to his dome&s;tick &s;ervants: But as mo&s;t of the&s;e &s;ettling in <HI>England</HI> were of no further u&s;e to him in that de&s;ign, &s;o his &s;etting up Epi&s;copacy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and his con|&s;tant aver&s;ion to the Kirk, how right &s;oever it might be in it &s;elf, was a great errour in policy; for the poorer that Kingdom was, it was both the more ea&s;y to gain them, and the more dangerous to offend them. So the terrour which the affecti|ons of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Nation might have ju&s;tly given the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> was &s;oon lo&s;t, by his engaging the whole Government to &s;up|port that which was then very contrary to the bent and genius of the Nation.</P>
<P>But tho' he &s;et up Bi&s;hops, he had no revenues to give them, <NOTE PLACE="marg">He &s;et up E+pi&s;copacy in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> but what he was to purcha&s;e for them. During his minority all the tithes and the church lands were ve&s;ted in the Crown: But this was only in order to the granting them away to the men that bore the chief &s;way. It is true, when he came of age he according to the law of <HI>Scotland</HI> pa&s;t a general revoca|tion of all that had been done in his infancy: And by this he could have re&s;umed all tho&s;e grants. He, and after him his &s;on, &s;ucceeded in one part of his de&s;ign: For by act of Parliament a Court was erected that was to examine and &s;eque&s;ter a third part of the tithes in every pari&s;h, and &s;o make a competent pro|vi&s;ion out of them to tho&s;e who &s;erved the cure; which had
<PB N="10" REF="26">
been re&s;erved in the great alienation for the &s;ervice of the church. This was carried at fir&s;t to a proportion of about thirty pounds a year, and was afterwards in his &s;on's time rai&s;ed to about fifty pounds a year; which con&s;idering the plenty and way of li|ving in that country is a very liberal provi&s;ion, and is equal in value to thrice that &s;um in the &s;outhern parts of <HI>England.</HI> In this he had both the clergy and the body of the people on his &s;ide. But he could not &s;o ea&s;ily provide for the Bi&s;hops: They were at fir&s;t forced to hold their former cures with &s;ome &s;mall addition.</P>
<P>But as they a&s;&s;umed at their fir&s;t &s;etting up little more au|thority than that of a con&s;tant pre&s;ident of the presbyters, &s;o <NOTE PLACE="marg">With a de|&s;ign to carry matters far|ther.</NOTE> they met with much rough oppo&s;ition. The King intended to carry on a conformity in matters of religion with <HI>England,</HI> and he begun to buy in from the Grantees many of the e&s;tates that belonged to the Bi&s;hopricks. It was al&s;o enacted, that a form of prayer &s;hould be drawn for <HI>Scotland:</HI> And the King was authorized to appoint the habits in which the divine offices were to be performed. Some of the chief holy-days were ordered to be ob&s;erv'd. The Sacrament was to be received kneeling, and to be given to the &s;ick. Confirmation was enacted; as al&s;o the u&s;e of the Cro&s;s in Bapti&s;m. The&s;e things were fir&s;t pa&s;t in ge|neral a&s;&s;emblies, which were compo&s;ed of Bi&s;hops and the de|puties cho&s;en by the Clergy, who &s;at all in one hou&s;e: And in it they reckoned the Bi&s;hops only as &s;ingle votes. Great oppo&s;ition was made to all the&s;e &s;teps: And the whole force of the Government was &s;trained to carry elections to tho&s;e meet|ings, or to take off tho&s;e who were cho&s;en; in which it was thought that no &s;ort of practice was omitted. It was pretended, that &s;ome were frighted, and others were corrupted.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops them&s;elves did their part very ill. They gene|rally grew haughty: They neglected their functions, and were <NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ of $word$ Bi&s;hops.</NOTE> often at Court, and lo&s;t all e&s;teem with the people. Some few that were &s;tricter and more learned did lean &s;o gro&s;ly to Pope|ry, that the heat and violence of the Reformation became the main &s;ubject of their &s;ermons and di&s;cour&s;es. King <HI>James</HI> grew weary of this oppo&s;ition, or was &s;o apprehen&s;ive of the ill ef|fects that it might have, that, what through &s;loth or fear, and what by rea&s;on of the great di&s;order into which his ill conduct brought his affairs in <HI>England</HI> in his latter years, he went no further in his de&s;igns on <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>He had three children. His elde&s;t, Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> was a Prince of great hopes; but &s;o very little like his father, that he <NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$ce <HI>$word$</HI> was be|lieved to be $span$ned.</NOTE> was rather feared than loved by him. He was &s;o zealous a Pro|te&s;tant
<PB N="11" REF="27">
that, when his father was entertaining propo&s;itions of marrying him to popi&s;h Prince&s;&s;es, once to the Archduche&s;s, and at another time to a daughter of <HI>Savoy,</HI> he in a letter that he wrote to the King on the twelfth of that <HI>October</HI> in which he died (the original of which Sir <HI>William Cook</HI> &s;hewed me) de|&s;ired, that if his father married him that way it might be with the younge&s;t per&s;on of the two, of who&s;e conver&s;ion he might have hope, and that any liberty &s;he might be allowed for her religion might be in the private&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible. Whether this aver|&s;ion to Popery ha&s;ten'd his death or not I cannot tell. Colonel <HI>Titus</HI> a&s;&s;ured me that he had from King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t's own mouth, that he was well a&s;&s;ured he was poi&s;oned by the Earl of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI>'s means. It is certain, that from the time of the Gunpowder Plot, King <HI>James</HI> was &s;o &s;truck with the terror of that danger he was then &s;o near, that ever after he had no mind to provoke the Je&s;uits; for he &s;aw what they were capable of.</P>
<P>And &s;ince I name that con&s;piracy which the Papi&s;ts in our <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gun|powder-Plot.</NOTE> days have had the impudence to deny, and to pretend it was an artifice of <HI>Cecill</HI>'s to engage &s;ome de&s;perate men into a Plot, which he managed &s;o that he could di&s;cover it when he plea&s;ed, I will mention what I my &s;elf &s;aw, and had for &s;ome time in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Sir <HI>Everard Digby</HI> died for being of the Con|&s;piracy: He was the Father of the famous Sir <HI>Kenelm Digby.</HI> The family being ruined upon the death of Sir <HI>Kenelm</HI>'s Son, when the executors were looking out for writings to make out the titles of the e&s;tates they were to &s;ell, they were directed by an old &s;ervant to a cupboard that was very artificially hid, in which &s;ome papers lay that &s;he had ob&s;erved Sir <HI>Kenelm</HI> was oft reading. They looking into it found a velvet bag, within which there were two other &s;ilk bags: (So carefully were tho&s;e re|licks kept:) And there was within the&s;e a collection of all the letters that Sir <HI>Everard</HI> writ during his impri&s;onment. In the&s;e he expre&s;&s;es great trouble, becau&s;e he heard &s;ome of their friends blamed their undertaking: He highly magnifies it; and &s;ays, if he had many lives he would willingly have &s;acrificed them all in carrying it on. In one paper he &s;ays, they had taken that care that there were not above two or three worth &s;aving, to whom they had not given notice to keep out of the way: And in none of tho&s;e papers does he expre&s;s any &s;ort of remor&s;e for that which he had been engaged in, and for which he &s;uffered.</P>
<P>Upon the di&s;covery of that Plot there was a general pro&s;ecu|tion <NOTE PLACE="marg">King $word$ was a$span$ of the Je$span$.</NOTE> of all Papi&s;ts &s;et on foot: But King <HI>James</HI> was very unea|&s;y at it; which was much encrea&s;ed by what Sir <HI>Dudly Carlton</HI> told him upon his return from <HI>Spain,</HI> where he had been Am|ba&s;&s;adour;
<PB N="12" REF="28">
(which I had from the Lord <HI>Hollis,</HI> who &s;aid to me that Sir <HI>Dudly Carlton</HI> told it to him&s;elf, and was much troubled when he &s;aw it had an effect contrary to what he had intended.) When he came home, he found the King at <HI>Theobald</HI>'s hunting in a very carele&s;s and unguarded manner: And upon that, in order to the putting him on a more careful looking to him&s;elf, he told the King he mu&s;t either give over that way of hunting, or &s;top another hunting that he was engaged in, which was Prie&s;t hunting: For he had intelligence in <HI>Spain</HI> that the Prie&s;ts were comforting them&s;elves with this, that if he went on again&s;t them they would &s;oon get rid of him: Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was a woman of form, and was always &s;o well attended, that all their plots again&s;t her failed, and were never brought to any effect: But a Prince who was always in woods or fore&s;ts would be ea|&s;ily overtaken. The King &s;ent for him in private to enquire more particularly into this: And he &s;aw it had made a great im|pre&s;&s;ion on him: But wrought otherwi&s;e than as he intended. For the King, re&s;olved to gratifie his humour in hunting and in a carele&s;s and irregular way of life, did immediately order all that pro&s;ecution to be let fall. I have the minutes of the Council Books of the year 1606, which are full of orders to di&s;charge and tran&s;port Prie&s;ts, &s;ometimes ten in a day. From thence to his dying day he continued always writing and talking a|gain&s;t Popery, but acting for it. He married his only daugh|ter to a Prote&s;tant Prince, one of the mo&s;t zealous and &s;incere of them all, the Elector <HI>Palatine;</HI> upon which a great Re|volution happen'd in the affairs of <HI>Germany.</HI> The elde&s;t branch of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> retained &s;ome of the impre&s;&s;ions that <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Elector <HI>P$span$</HI>'s Marriage.</NOTE> their Father <HI>Maximilian</HI> II. &s;tudied to infu&s;e into them, who as he was certainly one of the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t Princes of the&s;e latter ages, &s;o he was unalterably fixed in his opinion again&s;t per&s;ecution for matters of con&s;cience: His own &s;entiments were &s;o very favourable to the Prote&s;tant Doctrine, that he was thought inwardly theirs. His brother <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Grats</HI> was on the other hand wholly managed by the Je&s;uits, and was a zealous patron of theirs, and as zealou&s;ly &s;upported by them. <HI>Rodolph</HI> and <HI>Matthias</HI> reigned one after another, but without i&s;&s;ue. Their brother <HI>Albert</HI> was then dying in <HI>Flanders:</HI> So <HI>Spain</HI> with the popi&s;h intere&s;t joined to advance <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>G$ats:</HI> And he forced <HI>Matthias</HI> to re&s;ign the Crown of <HI>Bo|hemia</HI> to him, and got him&s;elf to be elected King. But his government became quickly &s;evere: He re&s;olved to extirpate the Prote&s;tants, and began to break thro' the privileges that were &s;ecured to them by the laws of that Kingdom.</P>

This occa&s;ioned a general in&s;urrection, which was followed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Affairs of <HI>Bohemia.</HI></NOTE> by an a&s;&s;embly of the States, who together with tho&s;e of <HI>Sile&s;ia Moravia</HI> and <HI>Lu&s;atia</HI> joined in depo&s;ing <HI>Ferdinand:</HI> And they offered their Crown fir&s;t to the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> who refu&s;ed it, and then to the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> who accepted of it, being encouraged to it by his two uncles <HI>Maurice</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Bullion.</HI> But he did not a&s;k the advice of King <HI>James:</HI> He only gave him notice of it when he had accepted the offer. Here was the probable&s;t occa&s;ion that has been of|fered &s;ince the Reformation for its full e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation was much inclined to &s;upport it: And it was expected that &s;o near a conjunction might have prevai|led on the King: But he had an invincible aver&s;ion to war; and was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the opinion of a divine right in all Kings, that he could not bear that even an elective and limited King &s;hould be called in que&s;tion by his &s;ubjects: So he would never acknowledge his &s;on-in-law King, nor give him any a&s;&s;i&s;tance for the &s;upport of his new dignity. And tho' it was al&s;o reck|oned on that <HI>France</HI> would enter into any de&s;ign that &s;hould bring down the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> by con&s;equence, yet even that was diverted by the means of <HI>De Luynes;</HI> a worthle&s;s but ab&s;olute favourite, whom the Archduche&s;s <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> Prince&s;s of the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands,</HI> gained to oblige the King into a neu|trality by giving him the riche&s;t heire&s;s then in <HI>Flanders,</HI> the daughter of <HI>Peguiney,</HI> left to her di&s;po&s;al, whom he married to his brother.</P>
<P>Thus poor <HI>Frederick</HI> was left without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The <NOTE PLACE="marg">The di&s;or|ders in <HI>Hol|land.</HI></NOTE> jealou&s;y that the <HI>Lutherans</HI> had of the a&s;cendant that the <HI>Cal|vini&s;ts</HI> might gain by this acce&s;&s;ion had an unhappy &s;hare in the coldne&s;s which all the Princes of that confe&s;&s;ion &s;hewed to|wards him; tho' <HI>Saxony</HI> only declared for <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> who like|wi&s;e engaged the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> at the head of a catholick league to maintain his intere&s;ts. <HI>Maurice</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had embroiled <HI>Holland</HI> by the e&s;pou&s;ing the controver&s;y about the decrees of God in oppo&s;ition to the <HI>$word$</HI> party, and by erecting a new and illegal court by the authority of the States General to judge of the affairs of the Province of <HI>Holland;</HI> which was plainly contrary to their con&s;titution, by which every Pro|vince is a Sovereignty within it&s;elf, not at all &s;ubordinate to the States General, who act only as Plenipotentiaries of the &s;everal Provinces to maintain their union and their common concerns. By that a&s;&s;embly <HI>Barnevelt</HI> was condemned and executed: <HI>Gro|tius</HI> and others were condemned to perpetual impri&s;onment: And an a&s;&s;embly of the mini&s;ters of the &s;everal Provinces met at
<PB N="14" REF="30">
<HI>Dort</HI> by the &s;ame authority, and condemned and deprived the <HI>Arminians. Maurice</HI>'s enemies gave it out that he ma|naged all this on de&s;ign to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the Provinces, and to put tho&s;e who were like to oppo&s;e him out of the way. But tho' this &s;eem a wild and groundle&s;s imagination, and not po&s;&s;ible to be compa&s;&s;ed; yet it is certain that he looked on <HI>Barnevelt</HI> and his party as men who were &s;o jealous of him and of a military power, that as they had forced the truce with <HI>Spain</HI> &s;o they would be very unwilling to begin a new war; tho' the di&s;putes about <HI>Juliers</HI> and <HI>Cleves</HI> had almo&s;t engaged them, and the truce was now near expiring; at the end of which he hoped, if delivered from the oppo&s;ition that he might look for from that party, to begin the war anew. By the&s;e means there was a great fermentation over all the Provinces, &s;o that <HI>Maurice</HI> was not then in condition to give the elected King any con&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance; tho' indeed he needed it much, for his conduct was very weak. He affected the grandeur of a re|gal court, and the magnificence of a crowned head too early: And his Queen &s;et up &s;ome of the gay diver&s;ions that &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to in her father's court, &s;uch as balls and ma&s;ks, which very much di&s;gu&s;ted the good <HI>Bohemians,</HI> who thought that a revolution made on the account of religion ought to have put on a greater appearance of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and &s;implicity. The&s;e particulars I had from the children of &s;ome who belonged to that court. The elected King was quickly overthrown, and driven not only out of tho&s;e his new dominions, but likewi&s;e out of his hereditary countries: He fled to <HI>Holland</HI> where he ended his days. I will go no farther in a matter &s;o well known as King <HI>James</HI>'s ill conduct in the whole &s;eries of that war, and that unheard of practice of &s;ending his only Son thro' <HI>France</HI> into <HI>Spain,</HI> of which the relations we have are &s;o full that I can add nothing to them.</P>
<P>I will only here tell &s;ome particulars with relation to <HI>Ger|many,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some pa&s;&s;a|ges of the Religion of &s;ome Prin+ces</NOTE> that <HI>Fab$span$,</HI> the wi&s;e&s;t divine I knew among them, told me he had from <HI>Charles Lewis</HI> the Elector <HI>Palatime</HI>'s own mouth.

of <HI>France</HI> and in the <HI>Netherlands</HI> depend on him. He was by that determined to declare for the <HI>Helvetian</HI> confe&s;&s;ion. But upon the ruin of his family the Duke of <HI>Newburgh</HI> had an en|terview with the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> about their concerns in <HI>Juliers</HI> and <HI>Cleves:</HI> And he per&s;uaded that Elector to turn <HI>Cal|vini&s;t;</HI> for &s;ince their family was fallen, nothing would more contribute to rai&s;e the other than the e&s;pou&s;ing that &s;ide, which would naturally come under his protection: But he added, that for him&s;elf he had turned Papi&s;t, &s;ince his little Principality lay &s;o near both <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> and <HI>Bavaria.</HI> This that Elector told with a &s;ort of plea&s;ure, when he made it appear that other Princes had no more &s;en&s;e of religion than he him&s;elf had.</P>
<P>Other circum&s;tances concurred to make King <HI>James</HI>'s reign in|glorious. <NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>James</HI> parted with the cautio|nary Towns.</NOTE> The States having borrowed great &s;ums of money of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> they gave her the <HI>Brill</HI> and <HI>Flu&s;hing,</HI> with &s;ome other places of le&s;s note, in pawn till the money &s;hould be repaid. Soon after his coming to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> he entered into &s;e|cret treaties with <HI>Spain,</HI> in order to the forcing the States to a peace: One article was, that if they were ob&s;tinate he would de|liver the&s;e places to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> When the truce was made, <HI>Barnevelt,</HI> tho' he had promoted it, yet knowing the &s;ecret ar|ticle, he &s;aw they were very un&s;afe while the keys of <HI>Hol|land</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> were in the hands of a Prince who might per|haps &s;ell them, or make an ill u&s;e of them: So he per&s;uaded the States to redeem the mortgage by repaying the money that <HI>Eng|land</HI> had lent, for which the&s;e places were put into their hands: And he came over him&s;elf to treat about it. King <HI>James,</HI> who was profu&s;e upon his favourites and &s;ervants, was delighted with the pro&s;pect of &s;o much money; and immediately, without cal|ling a Parliament to advi&s;e with them about it, he did yield to the propo&s;ition. So the money was paid, and the places were evacuated. But his profu&s;ene&s;s drew two other things up|on him, which broke the whole authority of the Crown, and the dependence of the Nation upon it. The Crown had a great e&s;tate over all <HI>England,</HI> which was all let out upon lea|&s;es for years, and a &s;mall rent was re&s;erved. So mo&s;t of the great families of the Nation were the tenants of the Crown, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>$span$</HI> broke the greatne&s;s of the Crown</NOTE> a great many burroughs were depending on the e&s;tates &s;o held. The renewal of the&s;e lea&s;es brought in fines to the Crown, and to the great officers: Be&s;ides that the fear of being denied a renewal kept all in a dependence on the Crown. King <HI>James</HI> obtained of his Parliament a power of granting, that is &s;elling, tho&s;e e&s;tates for ever, with the re&s;erve of the old quit-rent: And all the money rai&s;ed by this was profu&s;ely &s;quandred a|way.
<PB N="16" REF="32">
Another main part of the regal authority was the Wards, which anciently the Crown took into their own management. Our Kings were, according to the fir&s;t in&s;titution, the Guar|dians of the Wards. They bred them up in their courts, and di&s;po&s;ed of them in marriage as they thought fit. Afterwards they compounded, or forgave them, or gave them to &s;ome bran|ches of the family, or to provide the younger children. But they proceeded in this very gently: And the chief care after the Reformation was to breed the Wards Prote&s;tants. Still all were under a great dependence by this means. Much money was not rai&s;ed this way: But families were often at mercy, and were u&s;ed according to their behaviour. King <HI>James</HI> granted the&s;e generally to his &s;ervants and favourites: And they made the mo&s;t of them. So that what was before a dependence on the Crown, and was moderately compounded for, became then a mo&s;t exacting oppre&s;&s;ion, by which &s;everal families were rui|ned. This went on in King <HI>Charles</HI>'s time in the &s;ame me|thod. Our Kings thought they gave little when they di&s;po|&s;ed of a Ward, becau&s;e they made little of them. All this rai|&s;ed &s;uch an outcry, that Mr. <HI>Pierpoint</HI> at the Re&s;toration gathered &s;o many in&s;tances of the&s;e, and repre&s;ented them &s;o effectually to that Hou&s;e of Commons that called home King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;e|cond, that he per&s;uaded them to redeem them&s;elves by an offer of exci&s;e, which indeed produces a much greater revenue, but took away the dependence in which all families were held by the dread of leaving their heirs expo&s;ed to &s;o great a danger. <HI>Pier|point</HI> valued him&s;elf to me upon this &s;ervice he did his coun|try, at a time when things were &s;o little con&s;idered on either hand, that the court did not &s;eem to apprehend the value of what they parted with, nor the country of what they pur|cha&s;ed.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e publick actings King <HI>James</HI> &s;uffered much in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$her er+rours $span$</NOTE> opinion of all people by his &s;trange way of u&s;ing one of the greate&s;t men of that age, Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh;</HI> again&s;t whom the proceedings at fir&s;t were much cen&s;ured, but the la&s;t part of them was thought both barbarous and illegal. The whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the Earl of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI>'s ri&s;e and fall, of the Counte&s;s of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Overbury,</HI> the putting the inferiour per&s;ons to death for that infamous poy&s;oning, and the &s;paring the principals, both the Earl of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> and his Lady, were &s;o odious and inhuman, that it quite &s;unk the reputation of a reign, that on many other accounts was already much expo&s;ed to contempt and cen|&s;ure; which was the more &s;en&s;ible, becau&s;e it &s;ucceeded &s;uch a glorious and happy one. King <HI>James</HI> in the end of his reign
<PB N="17" REF="33">
was become weary of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who treated him with &s;uch an air of in&s;olent contempt that he &s;eemed at la&s;t re&s;olved to throw him off, but could not think of taking the load of government on him&s;elf, and &s;o re&s;olved to bring the Earl of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> again into favour, as that Lord reported it to &s;ome from whom I had it. He met with him in the night in the gardens at <HI>Theobalds:</HI> Two bed-chamber men were only in the &s;ecret: The King embraced him tenderly and with many tears: The Earl of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> believed the &s;ecret was not well kept; for &s;oon after the King was taken ill with &s;ome fits of an ague and died of it. My father was then in <HI>London,</HI> and did <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Death.</NOTE> very much &s;u&s;pect an ill practice in the matter: But perhaps Doctor <HI>Craig,</HI> my mother's uncle, who was one of the King's phy&s;icians, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him with the&s;e apprehen&s;ions; for he was di&s;graced for &s;aying he believed the King was poy&s;oned. It is certain no King could die le&s;s lamented or le&s;s e&s;teemed than he was. This &s;unk the credit of the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who as they were his creatures, &s;o they were obliged to a great depen|dence on him, and were thought guilty of gro&s;s and abject flat|tery towards him. His reign in <HI>England</HI> was a continued cour&s;e of mean practices. The fir&s;t condemnation of Sir <HI>Walter Ra|leigh</HI> was very black: But the executing him after &s;o many years, and after an employment that had been given him, was counted a barbarous &s;acrificing him to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> The ri&s;e and fall of the Earl of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> and the &s;wift progre&s;s of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s greatne&s;s, were things that expo&s;ed him to the cen|&s;ure of all the world. I have &s;een the originals of about twen|ty letters that he wrote to the Prince and that Duke while they were in <HI>Spain,</HI> which &s;hew a meanne&s;s as well as a fond|ne&s;s that render him very contemptible. The great Figure the Crown of <HI>England</HI> had made in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time, who had rendred her &s;elf the arbiter of chri&s;tendom, and was the won|der of the age, was &s;o much eclip&s;ed if not quite darkened during this reign, that King <HI>James</HI> was become the &s;corn of the age; and while hungry writers flattered him out of mea&s;ure at home, he was de&s;pi&s;ed by all abroad as a pedant without true judgment, courage, or &s;teadine&s;s, &s;ubject to his favourites and delivered up to the coun&s;els or rather the corruption of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>The Puritans gained credit, as the King and the Bi&s;hops lo&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Puri+tans</HI> gained ground</NOTE> it. They put on external appearances of great &s;trictne&s;s and gravity: They took more pains in their pari&s;hes than tho&s;e who adhered to the Bi&s;hops, and were often preaching again&s;t the vices of the Court; for which they were &s;ometimes puni&s;hed, tho' very gently, which rai&s;ed their reputation, and drew pre|&s;ents
<PB N="18" REF="34">
to them that made up their &s;ufferings abundantly. They begun &s;ome particular methods of getting their people to meet privately with them: And in the&s;e meetings they gave great vent to extemporary prayer, which was looked on as a &s;ort of in|&s;piration: And by the&s;e means they grew very popular. They were very factious and in&s;olent; and both in their &s;ermons and prayers were always mixing &s;evere reflections on their enemies. Some of them boldly gave out very many predictions; particu|larly two of them who were held prophets, <HI>Davi&s;on</HI> and <HI>Bruce.</HI> Some of the things that they foretold came to pa&s;s: But my father, who knew them both, told me of many of their pre|dictions that he him&s;elf heard them throw out, which had no effect: But all the&s;e were forgot, and if &s;ome more probable gue&s;&s;ings which they delivered as prophecies were accompli&s;h|ed, the&s;e were much magnified. They were very &s;piteful a|gain&s;t all tho&s;e who differed from them; and were wanting in no methods that could procure them either good u&s;age, or good pre&s;ents. Of this my father had great occa&s;ion to &s;ee many in|&s;tances: For my great grand-mother, who was a very rich wo|man and much engaged to them, was mo&s;t ob&s;equiou&s;ly cour|ted by them. <HI>Bruce</HI> lived concealed in her hou&s;e for &s;ome years: And they all found &s;uch advantages in their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to her, that &s;he was counted for many years the chief &s;upport of the par|ty: Her name was <HI>Rachel Arnot.</HI> She was daughter to Sir <HI>John Arnot,</HI> a man in great favour, and Lord Trea&s;urer deputy. Her hu&s;band <HI>John&s;toun</HI> was the greate&s;t merchant at that time; and left her an e&s;tate of 2000 pound a year, to be di&s;po&s;ed of among his children as &s;he plea&s;ed: And my father marrying her elde&s;t grand child &s;aw a great way into all the methods of the Puri|tans.</P>
<P><HI>Gowry</HI>'s con&s;piracy was by them charged on the King, as a <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gowry</HI>'s con|&s;piracy.</NOTE> contrivance of his to get rid of that Earl, who was then held in great e&s;teem: But my father, who had taken great pains to en|quire into all the particulars of that matter, did always believe it was a real con&s;piracy. One thing, which none of the Hi&s;to|rians have taken any notice of, and might have induced the Earl of <HI>Gowry</HI> to have wi&s;hed to put King <HI>James</HI> out of the way, but in &s;uch a di&s;gui&s;ed manner that he &s;hould &s;eem rather to have e&s;caped out of a &s;nare him&s;elf than to have laid one for the King, was this: Upon the King's death he &s;tood next to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to that Crown of <HI>England;</HI> for King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh's daughter that was married to King <HI>James</HI> the fourth did after his death mar|ry <HI>Dowglas</HI> Earl of <HI>Angus:</HI> But they could not agree: So a pre|contract was proved again&s;t him: Upon which, by a &s;entence
<PB N="19" REF="35">
from <HI>Rome,</HI> the marriage was voided, with a clau&s;e in favour of the i&s;&s;ue, &s;ince born under a marriage <HI>de facto</HI> and <HI>bona fide.</HI> Lady <HI>Margaret Dowglas</HI> was the child &s;o provided for. I did peru&s;e the original Bull confirming the divorce. After that, the Queen Dowager married one <HI>Francis Steward,</HI> and had by him a &s;on made Lord <HI>Methuen</HI> by King <HI>James</HI> the fifth. In the patent he is called <HI>frater no&s;ter uterinus.</HI> He had only a daughter, who was mother or grandmother to the Earl of <HI>Gowry:</HI> So that by this he might be glad to put the King out of the way, that &s;o he might &s;tand next to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown of <HI>England.</HI> He had a brother then a child, who when he grew up and found he could not carry the name of <HI>Ruthen,</HI> which by an act of Parliament made after this con&s;piracy none might carry, he went and lived beyond &s;ea; and it was given out that he had the philo&s;opher's &s;tone. He had two &s;ons who died without i&s;&s;ue, and one daughter married to Sir <HI>Anthony Vandike</HI> the famous picture drawer, who&s;e children according to his pedigree &s;tood very near to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown. It was not ea&s;y to per&s;uade the nation of the truth of that con&s;piracy: For eight years before that time King <HI>James,</HI> on a &s;ecret jealou&s;y of the Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> then e&s;teemed the hand&s;ome&s;t man of <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;et on the Marquis of <HI>Huntly,</HI> who was his mortal enemy, to murder him; and by a writing all in his own hand he promi&s;ed to &s;ave him harmle&s;s for it. He &s;et the hou&s;e in which he was on fire: And the Earl flying away was followed and murdered, and <HI>Huntly</HI> &s;ent <HI>Gordon</HI> of <HI>Buckey</HI> with the news to the King: Soon after, all who were concerned in that vile fact were pardo|ned, which laid the King open to much cen&s;ure. And this made the matter of <HI>Gowry</HI> to be the le&s;s believed.</P>
<P>When King <HI>Charles</HI> &s;ucceeded to the Crown he was at fir&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>Charles</HI> at fir&s;t a friend to the Puritans.</NOTE> thought favourable to the Puritans; for his tutor, and all his Court were of that way: And Dr. <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> then the head of the party, came up in the coach from <HI>Theobalds</HI> to <HI>London</HI> with the King and the Duke of <HI>Buckingham;</HI> which being again&s;t the rules of the Court gave great offence: But it was &s;aid, the King was &s;o over charged with grief, that he wanted the comfort of &s;o wi&s;e and &s;o great a man. It was al&s;o given out, that the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> offered Dr. <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> the Great Seal: But he was wi&s;er than to accept of it. I will go no further into the be|ginning of that reign with relation to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> affairs, which are fully opened by others. Only I will tell one particular which I had from the Earl of <HI>Lothian,</HI> who was bred up in the Court, and who&s;e father, the Earl of <HI>Ancram,</HI> was gentleman of the Bed|chamber, tho' him&s;elf was ever much hated by the King. He
<PB N="20" REF="36">
told me, that King <HI>Charles</HI> was much offended with King <HI>James</HI>'s light and familiar way, which was the effect of hunting and drinking, on which occa&s;ions he was very apt to forget his dig|nity, and to break out into great indecencies: On the other hand the &s;olemn gravity of the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> was more &s;uited to his own temper, which was &s;ullen even to a moro&s;ene&s;s. This led him to a grave re&s;erved deportment, in which he forgot the ci|vilities and the affability that the nation naturally loved, to which they had been long accu&s;tomed: Nor did he in his outward de|portment take any pains to oblige any per&s;ons what&s;oever: So far from that, he had &s;uch an ungracious way of &s;hewing favour, that the manner of be&s;towing it was almo&s;t as mortifying as the favour was obliging.

The fir&s;t of the&s;e was about the recovery of the tithes and church lands: He re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute his fa|ther's revocation, and to void all the grants made in his minori|ty, and to create titular Abbots as Lords of Parliament, but Lords, as Bi&s;hops, only for life. And that the two great families of <HI>Hamilton</HI> and <HI>Lenox</HI> might be good examples to the re&s;t of the nation, he by a &s;ecret purcha&s;e, and with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> money, bought the Abby of <HI>Aberbroth</HI> of the former, and the Lord&s;hip of <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> of the latter, and gave the&s;e to the two Archbi&s;hop|ricks. The&s;e Lords made a &s;hew of zeal after a good bargain, and &s;urrendered them to the King. He al&s;o purcha&s;ed &s;everal e&s;tates of le&s;s value to the &s;everal Sees; and all men, who pre|tended to favour at Court, offered their church lands to &s;ale at a low rate.</P>
<P>In the third year of his reign the Earl of <HI>Nithi&s;dale,</HI> then be|lieved a Papi&s;t, which he afterwards profe&s;&s;ed, having married a niece of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s, was &s;ent down with a pow|er to take the &s;urrender of all church lands, and to a&s;&s;ure all who did readily &s;urrender, that the King would take it kindly, and u&s;e them all very well, but that he would proceed with all rigour again&s;t tho&s;e who would not &s;ubmit their rights to his di&s;|po&s;al. Upon his coming down, tho&s;e who were mo&s;t concern|ed in tho&s;e grants met at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and agreed, that when they were called together, if no other argument did prevail to make the Earl of <HI>Nithi&s;dale</HI> de&s;i&s;t, they would fall upon him and all his party in the old <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> manner, and knock them on the head. <HI>Primro&s;e</HI> told me one of the&s;e Lords, <HI>Belhaven</HI> of the name of <HI>Dowgla&s;s</HI> who was blind, bid them &s;et him by one of
<PB N="21" REF="37">
the party; and he would make &s;ure of one. So he was &s;et next the Earl of <HI>Dunfrize:</HI> He was all the while holding him fa&s;t: And when the other a&s;ked him what he meant by that, he &s;aid, ever &s;ince the blindne&s;s was come on him he was in &s;uch fear of falling, that he could not help the holding fa&s;t to tho&s;e who were next to him: He had all the while a ponyard in his other hand, with which he had certainly &s;tabbed <HI>Dunfrize,</HI> if any di&s;|order had happen'd. The appearance at that time was &s;o great, and &s;o much heat was rai&s;ed upon it, that the Earl of <HI>Nithi&s;dale</HI> would not open all his in&s;tructions, but came back to Court, looking on the &s;ervice as de&s;perate: So a &s;top was put to it for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>In the year 1633 the King came down in per&s;on to be crown|ed. <NOTE PLACE="marg">He was crowned in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> In &s;ome conventions of the States that had been held before that all the money that the King had a&s;ked was given; and &s;ome petitions were offered &s;etting forth grievances, which tho&s;e whom the King employed had a&s;&s;ured them &s;hould be re|dre&s;&s;ed: But nothing was done, and all was put off till the King &s;hould come down in per&s;on. His entry and coronation were managed with &s;uch magnificence, that the countrey &s;uffered much by it: All was entertainment and &s;hew. When the Par|liament &s;ate, the Lords of the articles prepared an act declaring the royal prerogative, as it had been a&s;&s;erted by law in the year 1606; to which an addition was made of another act pa&s;s'd in the year 1609, by which King <HI>James</HI> was impower'd to pre|&s;cribe apparel to churchmen with their own con&s;ent. This was a per&s;onal thing to King <HI>James,</HI> in con&s;ideration of his great learning and experience, of which he had made no u&s;e during the re&s;t of his reign. And in the year 1617, when he held a Parli|ament there in per&s;on, an act was prepared by the Lords of the articles, authorizing all things that &s;hould thereafter be determin|ed in eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs by his Maje&s;ty, with con&s;ent of a com|petent number of the clergy, to have the &s;trength and power of a law. But the King either apprehended that great oppo|&s;ition would be made to the pa&s;&s;ing the act, or that great trou|ble would follow on the execution of it: So when the rubrick of the act was read, he ordered it to be &s;uppre&s;s'd, tho' pa&s;s'd in the articles. In this act of 1633 the&s;e acts of 1606 and 1609 were drawn into one. To this great oppo&s;ition was made by the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> who de&s;ired the acts might be divided: But the King &s;aid, it was now one act, and he mu&s;t either vote for it, or a|gain&s;t it. He &s;aid, he was for the prerogative as much as any man, but that addition was contrary to the liberties of the Church, and he thought no determination ought to be made in &s;uch mat|ters
<PB N="22" REF="38">
without the con&s;ent of the clergy, at lea&s;t without their be|ing heard. The King bid him argue no more, but give his vote: So he voted, not content. Some few Lords offered to argue: But the King &s;topt them, and commanded them to vote. Al|mo&s;t the whole Commons voted in the negative: So that the act was indeed rejected by the majority: Which the King knew; for he had called for a li&s;t of the numbers, and with his own pen had mark'd every man's vote: Yet the Clerk of Regi&s;ter, who gathers and declares the votes, &s;aid it was carried in the affirma|tive. The Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> affirmed it went for the negative: So the King &s;aid, the Clerk of Regi&s;ter's declaration mu&s;t be held good, unle&s;s the Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> would go to the Barr and ac|cu&s;e him of fal&s;ifying the record of Parliament, which was ca|pital: And in that ca&s;e, if he &s;hould fail in the proof he was liable to the &s;ame puni&s;hment: So he would not venture on that. Thus the act was publi&s;hed, tho' in truth it was rejected. The King expre&s;&s;ed a high di&s;plea&s;ure at all who had concurred in that oppo&s;ition. Upon that the Lords had many meetings: They reckoned that now all their liberties were gone, and a Parlia|ment was but a piece of pageantry, if the Clerk of Regi&s;ter might declare as he plea&s;ed how the vote went, and that no &s;crutiny were allowed. Upon that <HI>Hague</HI> the King's &s;olicitor, a zea|lous man of that party, drew a petition to be &s;igned by the Lords, and to be offered by them to the King, &s;etting forth all their grievances and praying redre&s;s: He &s;hewed this to &s;ome of them, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Balmeri|noch's <HI>trial.</HI></NOTE> and among others to the Lord <HI>Balmerinoch,</HI> who liked the main of it, but was for altering it in &s;ome particulars: He &s;poke of it to the Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> in the pre&s;ence of the Earl of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ilis</HI> and &s;ome others: None of them approved of it. The Earl of <HI>Ro|thes</HI> carryed it to the King; and told him, that there was a de|&s;ign to offer a petition in order to the explaining and ju&s;tify|ing their proceedings, and that he had a copy to &s;hew him: But the King would not look upon it, and ordered him to put a &s;top to it, for he would receive no &s;uch petition. The Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> told this to <HI>Balmerinoch:</HI> So the thing was laid a&s;ide: Only he kept a copy of it, and interlined it in &s;ome places with his own hand. While the King was in <HI>Scotland</HI> he erected a new Bi&s;hoprick at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and made one <HI>Forbes</HI> Bi&s;hop, who was a very learned and pious man: He had a &s;trange facul|ty of preaching five or &s;ix hours at a time: His way of life and devotion was thought mona&s;tick, and his learning lay in antiqui|ty: He &s;tudied to be a reconciler between Papi&s;ts and Prote&s;tants, leaning rather to the fir&s;t, as appears by his <HI>Con&s;iderationes mo|de&s;$a':</HI> He was a very &s;imple man, and knew little of the world:
<PB N="23" REF="39">
So he fell into &s;everal errors in conduct, but died &s;oon after &s;u&s;pected of Popery, which &s;u&s;picion was encrea&s;ed by his &s;on's turning Papi&s;t. The King left <HI>Scotland</HI> much di&s;contented, but re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute the de&s;ign of recovering the church lands: And Sir <HI>Thomas Hope,</HI> a &s;tubtil lawyer, who was believed to under&s;tand that matter beyond all the men of his profe&s;&s;ion, tho' in all re&s;pects he was a zealous Puritan, was made the King's advocate, upon his undertaking to bring all the church lands back to the Crown: Yet he proceeded in that matter &s;o &s;low|ly, that it was believed he acted in concert with the par|ty that oppo&s;ed it. Enough was already done to allarm all that were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the church lands: And they to engage the whole countrey in their quarrel took care to infu&s;e it into all people, but chiefly into the preachers, that all was done to make way for Popery. The winter after the King was in <HI>Scotland, Balmerinoch</HI> was thinking how to make the petition more accep|table: And in order to that he &s;hewed it to one <HI>Dunmoor</HI> a law|yer in whom he tru&s;ted, and de&s;ired his opinion of it, and &s;uf|fered him to carry it home with him, but charged him to &s;hew it to no per&s;on, and to take no copy of it. He &s;hewed it un|der a promi&s;e of &s;ecre&s;y to one <HI>Hay</HI> of <HI>Naughton,</HI> and told him from whom he had it. <HI>Hay</HI> looking on the paper, and &s;eeing it a matter of &s;ome con&s;equence, carried it to <HI>Spot&s;wood</HI> Arch|bi&s;hop of St. <HI>Andrews;</HI> who apprehending it was going about for hands was allarmed at it, and went immediately to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> beginning his journey as he often did on a &s;unday, which was a very odious thing in that country. There are laws in <HI>Scotland</HI> loo&s;ely worded that make it capital to &s;pread lies of the King or his Government, or to alienate his &s;ubjects from him. It was al&s;o made capital to know of any that do it, and not di&s;cover them: But this la&s;t was never once put in execution. The petition was thought within this act: So an order was &s;ent down for committing Lord <HI>Balmerinoch.</HI> The rea&s;on of it being for &s;ome time kept &s;ecret, it was thought done becau&s;e of his vote in parliament. But after &s;ome con&s;ultation a &s;pecial com|mi&s;&s;ion was &s;ent down for the trial. In <HI>Scotland</HI> there is a Court for the trial of Peers, di&s;tinct from the jury who are to be fifteen, and the majority determine the verdict: The fact being only referred to the jury or a&s;&s;ize as they call it, the law is judged by the Court: And if the majority of the jury are Peers, the re&s;t may be gentlemen. At this time a private gentleman of the name of <HI>Steward</HI> was become &s;o con&s;iderable that he was rai&s;ed by &s;everal degrees to be made Earl of <HI>Traquair</HI> and Lord Trea&s;urer, and was in great favour; but &s;uffered afterwards &s;uch a
<PB N="24" REF="40">
rever&s;e of fortune, that I &s;aw him &s;o low that he wanted bread, and was forced to beg; and it was believed died of hunger. He was a man of great parts, but of two much craft: He was thought the capable&s;t man for bu&s;ine&s;s, and the be&s;t &s;peaker in that Kingdom. So he was charged with the care of the Lord <HI>Balmerinoch</HI>'s trial: But when the ground of the pro&s;ecution was known, <HI>Hague</HI> who drew the petition writ a letter to the Lord <HI>Balmerinoch,</HI> in which he owned that he drew the petition with|out any direction or a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him: And upon that he went over to <HI>Holland.</HI> The Court was created by a &s;pecial commi&s;|&s;ion: In the naming of Judges there appeared too vi&s;ibly a de|&s;ign to have that Lord's life, for they were either very weak or very poor. Much pains was taken to have a jury; in which &s;o great partiality appeared, that when the Lord <HI>Balmerinoch</HI> was upon his challanges, and excepted to the Earl of <HI>Dunfri&s;e</HI> for his having &s;aid that if he were of his jury tho' he were as in|nocent as St. <HI>Paul</HI> he would find him guilty, &s;ome of the Judges &s;aid, that was only a ra&s;h word: Yet the King's advocate allow|ed the challenge if proved, which was done. The next cal|led on was the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> father to the Duke of that title: With him the Lord <HI>Balmerinoch</HI> had been long in enmity: Yet in&s;tead of challenging him, he &s;aid he was <HI>omni excep|tione major.</HI> It was long con&s;idered upon what the pri&s;oner &s;hould be tried: For his hand interlining the paper, which did plainly &s;often it, was not thought evidence that he drew it, or that he was acce&s;&s;ary to it: And they had no other proof again&s;t him: Nor could they from that infer that he was the divulger, &s;ince it did appear it was only &s;hewed by him to a lawyer for coun&s;el. So it was &s;ettled on to in&s;i&s;t on this, that the paper tended to alienate the &s;ubjects from their duty to the King, and that he, knowing who was the author of it, did not di&s;cover him, which by law was capital. The Court judged the paper to be &s;editious, and to be a lie of the King and his govern|ment: The other point was clear, that he knowing the author did not di&s;cover him. He pleaded for him&s;elf, that the &s;tatute for di&s;covery had never been put in execution; that it could never be meant but of matters that were notoriou&s;ly &s;editious; that till the Court judged &s;o he did not take this paper to be of that nature, but con&s;idered it as a paper full of duty, de&s;igned to &s;et him&s;elf and &s;ome others right in the King's opinion; that upon the fir&s;t &s;ight of it, tho' he approved of the main, yet he di&s;liked &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions in it; that he communicated the matter to the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> who told the King of the de&s;ign; and that, upon the King's &s;aying he would receive no &s;uch peti|tion,
<PB N="25" REF="41">
it was quite laid a&s;ide: This was atte&s;ted by the Earl of <HI>Ro|thes.</HI> A long debate had been much in&s;i&s;ted on, whether the Earl of <HI>Traquair</HI> or the King's mini&s;ters might be of the ju|ry or not: But the Court gave it in their favour. When the jury was &s;hut up, <HI>Gordon</HI> of <HI>Bucky,</HI> who was one of them, being then very antient, who forty three years before had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the murder of the Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> and was thought upon this occa&s;ion a &s;ure man, &s;poke fir&s;t of all, excu&s;ing his pre&s;umption in being the fir&s;t that broke the &s;ilence. He de&s;ired, they would all con|&s;ider what they were about: It was a matter of blood, and they would feel the weight of that as long as they lived: He had in his youth been drawn in to &s;hed blood, for which he had the King's pardon, but it co&s;t him more to obtain God's pardon: It had given him many &s;orrowful hours both day and night: And as he &s;poke this, the tears ran over his face. This &s;truck a damp on them all. But the Earl of <HI>Traquair</HI> took up the argument; and &s;aid, they had it not before them whether the law was a hard law or not, nor had they the nature of the paper before them, which was judged by the Court to be lea&s;ing-making; they were only to con&s;ider, whether the pri&s;oner had di&s;covered the contri|ver of the paper or not. Upon this the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> took up the argument again&s;t him, and urged, that &s;evere laws never executed were looked on as made only to terrify people, that tho', after the Court's having judged the paper to be &s;editious it would be capital to conceal the author, yet before &s;uch judgment the thing could not be thought &s;o evident that he was bound to reveal it. Upon the&s;e heads tho&s;e Lords argued the matter ma|ny hours: But when it went to the vote, &s;even acquitted, but eight ca&s;t him: So &s;entence was given. Upon this many meet|ings <NOTE PLACE="marg">He was con|demned</NOTE> were held: And it was re&s;olved either to force the pri&s;on to &s;et him at liberty, or if that failed to revenge his death both on the Court and on the eight jurors; &s;ome undertaking to kill them, and others to burn their hou&s;es. When the Earl of <HI>Tra|quair</HI> under&s;tood this, he went to Court, and told the King that the Lord <HI>Balmerinoch</HI>'s life was in his hands, but the exe|cution was in no &s;ort advi&s;eable: So he procured his pardon, for <NOTE PLACE="marg">But par|doned</NOTE> which the party was often reproached with his ingratitude: But he thought he had been much wronged in the pro&s;ecution, and &s;o little regarded in the pardon, that he never looked on him|&s;elf as under any obligation on that account. My father knew the whole &s;teps of this matter, having been the Earl of <HI>Lauder|dale</HI>'s mo&s;t particular friend: He often told me, that the ruin of the King's affairs in <HI>Scotland</HI> was in a great mea&s;ure owing to that pro&s;ecution; and he carefully pre&s;erved the petition it

&s;elf, and the papers relating to the trial; of which I never &s;aw any copy be&s;ides tho&s;e which I have. And that rai&s;ed in me a de&s;ire of &s;eeing the whole record, which was copied for me, and is now in my hands. It is a little volume, and contains, according to the <HI>Scotch</HI> method, the whole ab&s;tract of all the pleadings, and all the evidence that was given; and is indeed a very noble piece, full of curious matter.</P>
<P>When the de&s;ign of recovering the tithes went on, tho' but <NOTE PLACE="marg">A liturgy prepared.</NOTE> &s;lowly, another de&s;ign made a greater progre&s;s. The Bi&s;hops of <HI>Scotland</HI> fell on the framing of a liturgy and a body of ca|nons for the wor&s;hip and government of that church. The&s;e were never examined in any publick a&s;&s;embly of the clergy: All was managed by three or four a&s;piring Bi&s;hops, <HI>Maxwell, Sid|&s;er&s;e, Whitford,</HI> and <HI>Banautine,</HI> the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Ro&s;s, Galloway, Dunblane,</HI> and <HI>Aberdeen. Maxwel</HI> did al&s;o accu&s;e the Earl of <HI>Traquair,</HI> as cold in the King's &s;ervice, and as managing the trea&s;ury deceitfully; and he was a&s;piring to that office. <HI>Spot&s;|wood,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> then Lord Chancellour, was a prudent and mild man, but of no great decency in his cour&s;e of life. The Earl of <HI>Traquair,</HI> &s;eeing him&s;elf &s;o pu&s;hed at, was more earne&s;t than the Bi&s;hops them&s;elves in promoting the new model of wor&s;hip and di&s;cipline; and by that he recovered the ground he had lo&s;t with the King, and with Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud:</HI> He al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Bi&s;hops in obtaining commi&s;&s;ions, &s;ublatern to the High-commi&s;&s;ion Court, in their &s;everal dioce&s;es, which were thought little different from the Courts of Inqui&s;ition. <HI>Sid|&s;erfe</HI> &s;et this up in <HI>Galloway:</HI> And a complaint being made in Council of his proceedings, he gave the Earl of <HI>Argile</HI> the lie in full Council. He was after all a very learned and good man, but &s;trangely heated in tho&s;e matters. And they all were &s;o lifted up with the King's zeal, and &s;o encouraged by Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud,</HI> that they lo&s;t all temper; of which I knew <HI>Sid&s;erfe</HI> made great acknowledgments in his old age.</P>
<P>But the unaccountable part of the King's proceedings was, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The feeble|ne&s;s of the government.</NOTE> that all this while, when he was endeavouring to recover &s;o great a part of the property of <HI>Scotland</HI> as the church lands and tithes were from men that were not like to part with them willingly, and was going to change the whole con&s;titution of that Church and Kingdom, he rai&s;ed no force to mantain what he was about to do, but tru&s;ted the whole management to the civil execution. By this all people &s;aw the weakne&s;s of the government, at the &s;ame time that they complained of its rigour. All that came down from Court complained of the King's inexorable &s;tiffne&s;s, and of the progre&s;s Popery was making, of the Queen's power

with the King, of the favour &s;hewed the Popes <HI>Nuntios,</HI> and of the many pro&s;elytes who were daily falling off to the church of <HI>Rome.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Traquair</HI> infu&s;ed this more effectually, tho' more covertly, than any other man could do: And when the country formed the fir&s;t oppo&s;ition they made to the King's pro|clamations, and prote&s;ted again&s;t them, he drew the fir&s;t pro|te&s;tation, as <HI>Primro&s;e</HI> a&s;&s;ured me; tho' he de&s;igned no more than to put a &s;top to the credit the Bi&s;hops had, and to the fury of their proceedings: But the matter went much farther than he &s;eemed to intend: For he him&s;elf was fatally caught in the &s;nare laid for others. A troop of hor&s;e and a regiment of foot had prevented all that followed, or rather had by all appearance e&s;ta|bli&s;hed an arbitrary government in that Kingdom: But to &s;peak in the language of a great man, tho&s;e who conducted matters at that time had as little of the prudence of the &s;erpent as of the innocence of the dove: And, as my father often told me, he and many others who adhered in the &s;equel firmly to the King's intere&s;t were then much troubled at the whole conduct of af|fairs, as being neither wi&s;e, legal, nor ju&s;t. I will go no far|ther in opening the beginnings of the troubles of <HI>Scotland:</HI> Of the&s;e a full account will be found in the memoirs of the Dukes of <HI>Hamilton.</HI> The violence with which that Kingdom did al|mo&s;t unanimou&s;ly engage again&s;t the admini&s;tration may ea&s;i|ly convince one, that the provocation mu&s;t have been very great to draw on &s;uch an entire and vehement concurrence a|gain&s;t it.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t pacification, upon the new di&s;putes that aro&s;e, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Saville</HI>'s for|gery prey al|led on the <HI>Scots.</HI></NOTE> when the Earl of <HI>Lowdun</HI> and <HI>Dun&s;ermling</HI> were &s;ent up with the petition from the covenanters, the Lord <HI>Saville</HI> came to them, and informed them of many particulars, by which they &s;aw the King was highly irritated again&s;t them: He took great pains to per&s;uade them to come with their army into <HI>England.</HI> They very unwillingly hearken'd to that propo&s;ition, and looked on it as a de&s;ign from the Court to en&s;nare them, making the <HI>Scots</HI> invade <HI>England,</HI> by which this Nation might have been provo|ked to a&s;&s;i&s;t the King to conquer <HI>Scotland.</HI> It is true, he hated the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> &s;o much, that they &s;aw no cau&s;e to &s;u&s;|pect him: So they entred into a treaty with him about it. The Lord <HI>Saville</HI> a&s;&s;ured them, he &s;pake to them in the name of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable men in <HI>England;</HI> and he &s;hewed them an en|gagement under their hands to join with them, if they would come into <HI>England,</HI> and refu&s;e any treaty but what &s;hould be confirmed by a Parliament of <HI>England.</HI> They de&s;ired leave to &s;end this paper into <HI>Scotland,</HI> to which after much &s;eeming dif|ficulty

he con&s;ented: So a cane was hollowed, and this was put within it; and one <HI>Fro&s;t,</HI> afterwards &s;ecretary to the Committee of both Kingdoms, was &s;ent down with it as a poor traveller. It was to be communicated only to three per&s;ons, the Earls of <HI>Ro|thes</HI> and <HI>Argile,</HI> and to <HI>Wari&s;toun,</HI> the three chief confidents of the covenanters. The Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> was a man of plea&s;ure, but <NOTE PLACE="marg">The charac|ters of the chief of the covenanters.</NOTE> of a mo&s;t obliging temper: His affairs were low: <HI>Spot&s;wood</HI> had once made the bargain between the King and him before the troubles, but the Earl of <HI>Traquair</HI> broke it, &s;eeing he was to be rai&s;ed above him&s;elf. The Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> had all the arts of making him&s;elf popular; only there was too much levity in his temper, and too much liberty in his cour&s;e of life. The Earl of <HI>Argile</HI> was a more &s;olemn &s;ort of a man, grave and &s;o|ber, free of all &s;candalous vices, of an invincible calmne&s;s of temper, and a pretender to high degrees of piety: He was much &s;et on rai&s;ing his own family to be a &s;ort of King in the High|lands.</P>
<P><HI>Wari&s;toun</HI> was my own uncle: He was a man of great appli|cation, could &s;eldom &s;leep above three hours in the twenty four: He had &s;tudied the law carefully, and had a great quickne&s;s of thought with an extraordinary memory. He went into very high notions of lengthen'd devotions, in which he continued many hours a day: He would often pray in his family two hours at a time, and had an unexhau&s;ted copiou&s;ne&s;s that way. What thought &s;oever &s;truck his fancy during tho&s;e effu&s;ions, he look|ed on it as an an&s;wer of prayer, and was wholly determined by it. He looked on the Covenant as the &s;etting Chri&s;t on his throne, and &s;o was out of mea&s;ure zealous in it. He had no regard to the rai&s;ing him&s;elf or his family, tho' he had thirteen children: But Presbytery was to him more than all the world. He had a readine&s;s and vehemence of &s;peaking that made him very con|&s;iderable in publick a&s;&s;emblies: And he had a fruitful invention; &s;o that he was at all times furni&s;hed with expedients. To the&s;e three only this paper was to be &s;hewed upon an oath of &s;ecre|cy: And it was to be depo&s;ited in <HI>Wari&s;toun</HI>'s hands. They were only allowed to publi&s;h to the Nation, that they were &s;ure of a very great and unexpected a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which tho' it was to be kept &s;ecret would appear in due time. This they publi&s;hed: And it was looked on as an artifice to draw in the Nation: But it was afterwards found to be a cheat indeed, but a cheat of Lord <HI>Saville</HI>'s who had forged all the&s;e &s;ub&s;criptions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> marched with a very &s;orry equipage: Every &s;oul|dier carried a week's provi&s;ion of oatmeal; and they had a <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Scots came into $word$.</NOTE> drove of cattel with them for their food. They had al&s;o an
<PB N="29" REF="45">
invention of guns of white iron tinned and done about with lea|ther, and chorded &s;o that they could &s;erve for two or three di&s;|charges. The&s;e were light, and were carried on hor&s;es: And when they came to <HI>Newburn,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> army that defended the <HI>Ford</HI> was &s;urprized with a di&s;charge of artillery: Some thought it magick; and all were put in &s;uch di&s;order that the whole army did run with &s;o great precipitation, that Sir <HI>Thomas Fair|&s;ax,</HI> who had a command in it, did not &s;tick to own that till he pa&s;s'd the <HI>Tees</HI> his legs trembled under him. This &s;truck many of the enthu&s;ia&s;ts of the King's &s;ide, as much as it exalted the <HI>Scots;</HI> who were next day po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> and &s;o were ma&s;ters not only of <HI>Northumberland</HI> and the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Du|re&s;me,</HI> but of the coalries; by which, if they had not been in a good under&s;tanding with the City of <HI>London,</HI> they could have di&s;tre&s;&s;ed them extremely: But all the u&s;e the City made of this was, to rai&s;e a great outcry, and to complain of the war, &s;ince it was now in the power of the <HI>Scots</HI> to &s;tarve them. Upon that petitions were &s;ent from the City and from &s;ome Counties to the King, praying a treaty with the <HI>Scots.</HI> The Lord <HI>Wharton</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great di&s;|contents in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> and the Lord <HI>Howard</HI> of <HI>E&s;crick</HI> undertook to deliver &s;ome of the&s;e; which they did, and were clapt up upon it. A coun|cil of war was held; and it was re&s;olved on, as the Lord <HI>Whar|ton</HI> told me, to &s;hoot them at the head of the army, as movers of &s;edition. This was chiefly pre&s;s'd by the Earl of <HI>Stra&s;&s;ord.</HI> Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> &s;poke nothing till the Council ro&s;e; and then he a&s;ked <HI>Stra&s;&s;ord,</HI> if he was &s;ure of the army, who &s;eemed &s;ur|pri&s;ed at the que&s;tion. But he upon enquiry under&s;tood that ve|ry probably a general mutiny, if not a total revolt, would have followed, if any &s;uch execution had been attempted. This &s;ucce&s;s of the <HI>Scots</HI> ruined the King's affairs. And by it the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of the union of the two Kingdoms may appear very evi|dent: For nothing but a &s;uperiour army able to beat the <HI>Scots</HI> can hinder their doing this at any time: And the &s;ei&s;ing the coal|ries mu&s;t immediately bring the City of <HI>London</HI> into great di&s;|tre&s;s. Two armies were now in the north as a load on the King, be&s;ides all the other grievances. The Lord <HI>Saville</HI>'s for|gery came to be di&s;covered. The King knew it; and yet he was brought afterwards to tru&s;t him, and to advance him to be Earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex.</HI> The King pre&s;&s;ed my uncle to deliver him the letter, who excu&s;ed him&s;elf upon his oath; and not knowing what u&s;e might be made of it, he cut out every &s;ub&s;cription, and &s;ent it to the per&s;on for whom it was forged. The imitation was &s;o exact, that every man, as &s;oon as he &s;aw his hand &s;im|ply by it&s;elf, acknowledged that he could not have denied it.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="46">
The King was now in great &s;traits: He had laid up 700000 <HI>l.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The ill &s;tate of the King's affairs.</NOTE> before the troubles in <HI>Scotland</HI> began; and yet had rai&s;ed no guards nor force in <HI>England,</HI> but tru&s;ted a very illegal admini&s;|tration to a legal execution. His trea&s;ure was now exhau&s;ted; his &s;ubjects were highly irritated; the mini&s;try were all frighted, being expo&s;ed to the anger and ju&s;tice of the Parliament: So that he had brought him&s;elf into great di&s;tre&s;s, but had not the dexterity to extricate him&s;elf out of it. He loved high and rough methods, but had neither the &s;kill to conduct them, nor the height of genius to manage them. He hated all that offered prudent and moderate coun&s;els: He thought it flowed from a meanne&s;s of &s;pirit, and a care to pre&s;erve them&s;elves by &s;acrifi|cing his authority, or from republican principles: And even when he &s;aw it was nece&s;&s;ary to follow &s;uch advices, yet he ha|ted tho&s;e that gave them. His heart was wholly turned to the gaining the two armies. In order to that he gained the Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> entirely, who hoped by the King's mediation to have married the Counte&s;s of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> a rich and magnificent la|dy that lived long in the greate&s;t &s;tate of any in that age: He al&s;o gained the Earl of <HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> who was a young man well learn|ed, who had travelled, but had taken upon him the port of a hero too much. When he was beyond &s;ea he travelled with the Earl of <HI>Denbigh;</HI> and they con&s;ulted all the a&s;trologers they could hear of. I plainly &s;aw the Earl of <HI>Denbigh</HI> relied on what had been told him to his dying day; and the rather becau&s;e the Earl of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> was promi&s;ed a glorious fortune for &s;ome time, but all was to be overthrown in conclu&s;ion. When the Earl of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> returned from his travels, he was not con&s;idered by the King as he thought he de&s;erved: So he &s;tudied to render him|&s;elf popular in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and he was the fir&s;t man in the oppo|&s;ition they made during the fir&s;t war. He both advi&s;ed and drew the letter to the King of <HI>France,</HI> for which the Lord <HI>Low|dun</HI> who &s;igned it was impri&s;oned in the Tower of <HI>London.</HI> But the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> as he him&s;elf told me, when it came to his turn to &s;ign that letter, found fal&s;e <HI>French</HI> in it; for in|&s;tead of <HI>rayons de &s;oleil</HI> he had writ <HI>raye de &s;oleil,</HI> which in <HI>French</HI> &s;ignifies a &s;ort of fi&s;h; and &s;o the matter went no farther at that time; and the treaty came on &s;o &s;oon after, that it was never again taken up. The Earl of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> was gained by the King at <HI>Berwick,</HI> and undertook to do great &s;ervices. He ei|ter fancied, or at lea&s;t he made the King fancy, that he could turn the whole Kingdom: Yet indeed he could do nothing. He was again trying to make a new party: And he kept a corre&s;|pondence with the King when he lay at <HI>Newca&s;tle;</HI> and was pre|tending
<PB N="31" REF="47">
he had a great intere&s;t among the covenanters, where|as at that time he had none at all. All the&s;e little plottings came to be either known, or at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected. The Queen was a woman of great vivacity in conver&s;ation, and loved all her life long to be in intrigues of all &s;orts, but was not &s;o &s;ecret in them as &s;uch times and &s;uch affairs required. She was a woman of no manner of judgment: She was bad at contrivance, but much wor&s;e in the execution: But by the liveline&s;s of her di&s;cour&s;e &s;he made always a great impre&s;&s;ion on the King: And to her little practices, as well as to the King's own temper, the &s;equel of all his misfortunes was owing. I know it was a maxim infu&s;ed into his &s;ons, which I have often heard from King <HI>James,</HI> that he was undone by his conce&s;&s;ions. This is true in &s;ome re&s;pect: For his pa&s;&s;ing the act that the Parliament &s;hould &s;it during plea&s;ure was indeed his ruin, to which he was drawn by the Queen. But if he had not made great conce&s;&s;ions, he had &s;unk without being able to make a &s;truggle for it; and could not have divided the Nation, or engaged &s;o many to have &s;tood by him: Since by the conce&s;&s;ions that he made, e&s;pecially that of the triennial Parliament, the hone&s;t and quiet part of the Nation was &s;atisfied, and thought their religion and liberties were &s;ecured: So they broke off from tho&s;e violenter propo&s;iti|ons that occa&s;ioned the war.</P>
<P>The truth was, the King did not come into tho&s;e conce&s;|&s;ions &s;ea&s;onably, nor with a good grace: All appeared to be extorted from him. There were al&s;o grounds, whether true or plau&s;ible, to make it to be believed, that he intended not to &s;tand to them any longer than he lay under that force that vi|&s;ibly drew them from him contrary to his own inclinations. The proofs that appeared of &s;ome particulars, that made this &s;eem true, made other things that were whi&s;pered to be more readily believed: For in all critical times there are deceitful people of both &s;ides, that pretend to merit by making di&s;coveries, on condition that no u&s;e &s;hall be made of them as witne&s;&s;es; which is one of the mo&s;t pe&s;tiferous ways of calumny po&s;&s;ible. Almo&s;t the whole Court had been concerned in one illegal grant or another: So the&s;e Courtiers, to get their faults pa&s;s'd over, were as &s;o many &s;pies upon the King and Queen: They told all they heard, and perhaps not without large additions, to the leading men of the Hou&s;e of Commons. This inflamed the jealou&s;y, and pu&s;h'd them on to the making &s;till new demands. One eminent pa&s;|&s;age was told me by the Lord <HI>Hollis:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$ up by the King</NOTE></P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> had married his &s;i&s;ter: So, tho' in that Parliament he was one of the hotte&s;t men of the party, yet when
<PB N="32" REF="48">
that matter was before them he always withdrew. When the bill of attainder was pa&s;s'd, the King &s;ent for him to know what he could do to &s;ave the Earl of <HI>Strafford. Hollis</HI> an&s;wered, that if the King plea&s;ed, &s;ince the execution of the law was in him, he might legally grant him a reprieve, which mu&s;t be good in law; but he would not advi&s;e it. That which he propo&s;ed was, that Lord <HI>Strafford</HI> &s;hould &s;end him a petition for a &s;hort re&s;|pite, to &s;ettle his affairs and to prepare for death; upon which he advi&s;ed the King to come next day with the petition in his hands, and lay it before the two hou&s;es with a &s;peech which he drew for the King; and <HI>Hollis</HI> &s;aid to him, he would try his intere&s;t among his friends to get them to con&s;ent to it. He prepared a great many by a&s;&s;uring them, that if they would &s;ave Lord <HI>Strafford</HI> he would become wholly theirs in con&s;equence of his fir&s;t principles: And that he might do them much more &s;er|vice by being pre&s;erved, than he could do if made an exam|ple upon &s;uch new and doubtful points. In this he had wrought on &s;o many, that he believed if the King's party had &s;truck into it he might have &s;aved him. It was carried to the Queen, as if <HI>Hollis</HI> had engaged that the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> &s;hould accu&s;e her, and di&s;cover all he knew: So the Queen not only diver|ted the King from going to the Parliament, changing the &s;peech into a me&s;&s;age all writ with the King's own hand, and &s;ent to the Hou&s;e of Lords by the Prince of <HI>Wales:</HI> [which <HI>Hollis</HI> had &s;aid, would have perhaps done as well, the King being apt to &s;poil things by an unacceptable manner:] But to the wonder of the whole world, the Queen prevailed with him to add that mean po&s;t&s;cript, <HI>if he mu&s;t die, it were charity to reprieve him till Saturday:</HI> Which was a very unhand&s;ome giving up of the whole me&s;&s;age. When it was communicated to both hou&s;es, the whole Court party was plainly again&s;t it: And &s;o he fell truly by the Queen's means.</P>
<P>The mentioning this makes me add one particular concerning Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud:</HI> When his impeachment was brought to the Lords bar, he apprehending how it would end, &s;ent over <HI>War+ner,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ler,</HI> with the keys of his clo&s;et and cabi|net, that he might de&s;troy or put out of the way all papers that might either hurt him&s;elf or any body el&s;e. He was at that work for three hours, till upon <HI>Laud</HI>'s being committed to the black rod a me&s;&s;enger went over to &s;eal up his clo&s;et, who came after all was withdrawn. Among the writings he took away, it is believed the original <HI>Magna Charta</HI> pa&s;&s;ed by King <HI>J$span$</HI> in the mead near $word$ was one. This was found among $word$ papers by his $word$: And that de&s;cended to his &s;on
<PB N="33" REF="49">
and executor, Colonel <HI>Lee,</HI> who gave it to me. So it is now in my hands; and it came very fairly to me. For this conveyance of it we have nothing but conjecture.</P>
<P>I do not intend to pro&s;ecute the hi&s;tory of the wars. I have told a great deal relating to them in the memoirs of the Dukes of <HI>Hamilton. Ru&s;hworth</HI>'s collections contain many excellent materials: And now the fir&s;t volume of the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s hi&s;tory gives a faithful repre&s;entation of the beginnings of the troubles, tho' writ in favour of the Court, and full of the be&s;t excu&s;es that &s;uch ill things were capable of. I &s;hall therefore only &s;et out what I had particular rea&s;on to know, and what is not to be met with in books.</P>
<P>The Kirk was now &s;ettled in <HI>Scotland</HI> with a new mixture of <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> ruling elders; which, tho' they were taken from the <HI>Geneva</HI> pat|tern to a&s;&s;i&s;t or rather to be a check on the Mini&s;ters in the ma|naging the parochial di&s;cipline, yet the&s;e never came to their a&s;&s;emblies till the year 1638, that they thought it nece&s;&s;ary to make them fir&s;t go and carry all the $word$ of the Min&s;ters at the &s;everal presbyteries, and next come them&s;elves and &s;it in the a&s;&s;emblies. The nobiliy and ch$span$ gentry off red them&s;elves upon that occa&s;ion: And the Mini&s;ters, &s;ince they &s;aw they w$$e like to act in oppo&s;ition to the Kings orders, were glad to have &s;o great a &s;upport. But the $word$ $word$ now came to a&s;|&s;i&s;t them biginning to take, as the Mini&s;ters thought, too much on them, they grew weary of &s;uch imperious ma&s;ters: So they &s;tudied to work up the inferiour people to much $eal: And as they wrought any up to &s;ome mea&s;ure of heat and knowledge, they brought them al&s;o into their elder&s;hip, and &s;o $word$ $word$ ma|jority of hot zealots who depended on them. One ou$ of the&s;e was $$puted to attend on the $span$.

be re&s;trained: And it grew &s;o petulant, that the pulpit was a &s;cene of news and pa&s;&s;ion. For &s;ome years this was managed with great appearances of fervour by men of age and &s;ome authority: But when the younger and hotter zealots took it up, it became odious to almo&s;t all &s;ort of people, except &s;ome &s;our enthu|&s;ia&s;ts, who thought all their impertinence was zeal and an ef|fect of in&s;piration; which flowed naturally from the conceit of extemporary prayers being praying by the &s;pirit.</P>
<P><HI>Hender&s;on,</HI> a Mini&s;ter of <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> was by much the wi&s;e&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief Mini&s;ters of the party.</NOTE> and grave&s;t of them all: But as all his performances that I have &s;een are flat and heavy, &s;o he found it was an ea&s;ier thing to rai&s;e a flame than to quench it. He &s;tudied to keep his par|ty to him: Yet he found he could not moderate the heat of &s;ome fiery &s;pirits: So when he &s;aw he could follow them no more, but that they had got the people out of his hands, he &s;unk both in body and mind, and died &s;oon after. The per&s;on next to him was <HI>Douglas,</HI> believed to be de&s;cended from the royal fa|mily tho' the wrong way: There appeared an air of greatne&s;s in him, that made all that &s;aw him inclined enough to be|lieve he was of no ordinary de&s;cent. He was a re&s;erved man: He had the &s;criptures by heart to the exactne&s;s of a <HI>Jew;</HI> for he was as a concordance: He was too calm and too grave for the furious men, but yet he was much depended on for his prudence. I knew him in his old age; and &s;aw plainly, he was a &s;lave to his popularity, and dur&s;t not own the free thoughts he had of &s;ome things for fear of offending the people.</P>
<P>I will not run out in giving the characters of the other lea|ding preachers among them, &s;uch as <HI>Dick&s;on, Blair, Rutherford, Baily, Cant,</HI> and the two <HI>Gilli&s;pys.</HI> They were men all of a &s;ort: They affected great &s;ublimities in devotion: They poured them|&s;elves out in their prayers with a loud voice, and often with ma|ny tears. They had but an ordinary proportion of learning among them; &s;ome thing of <HI>Hebrew,</HI> and very little <HI>Greek:</HI> Books of controver&s;y with <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> but above all with the <HI>Armi|nians,</HI> was the height of their &s;tudy. A way of preaching by doctrine, rea&s;on, and u&s;e was that they &s;et up on: And &s;ome of them affected a &s;train of &s;tating ca&s;es of con&s;cience, not with relation to moral actions, but to &s;ome reflexions on their con|dition and temper: That was occa&s;ioned chiefly by their con|ceit of praying by the &s;pirit, which every one could not attain to, or keep up to the &s;ame heat in at all times. The learn|ing they recommended to their young divines were &s;ome <HI>Ger|man</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their &s;tu|dies, and o|ther me|thods.</NOTE> &s;y&s;temes, &s;ome commentators on the &s;cripture, books of controver&s;y, and practical books: They were &s;o careful to ob|lige
<PB N="35" REF="51">
them to make their round in the&s;e, that if they had no men of great learning among them, yet none were very igno|rant: As if they had thought an equality in learning was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to keep up the parity of their Government. None could be &s;uffered to preach as Expectants, (as they called them,) but after a tryal or two in private before the Mini&s;ters alone: Then two or three &s;ermons were to be preached in publick, &s;ome more learnedly, &s;ome more practically: Then a head in divini|ty was to be common placed in <HI>Latin,</HI> and the per&s;on was to main|tain <HI>The&s;es</HI> upon it: He was al&s;o to be tried in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew,</HI> and in &s;cripture chronology. The que&s;tionary trial came la&s;t, every Mini&s;ter a&s;king &s;uch que&s;tions as he plea&s;ed. When any had pa&s;s'd thro' all the&s;e with approbation, which was done in a cour&s;e of three or four months, he was allowed to preach when invited. And if he was pre&s;ented or called to a Church, he was to pa&s;s thro' a new &s;et of the &s;ame tryals. This made that there was a &s;mall circle of knowledge in which they were generally well in&s;tructed. True morality was little &s;tudied or e&s;|teemed by them: They took much pains among their people to maintain their authority: They affected all the ways of fami|liarity that were like to gain on them.</P>
<P>They forced all people to &s;ign the covenant: And the greate&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their great &s;everity.</NOTE> part of the Epi&s;copal Clergy, among whom there were two Bi&s;h|ops, came to them, and renounced their former principles, and de&s;ired to be received into their body. At fir&s;t they re|ceived all that offered them&s;elves: But afterwards they repented of this: And the violent men among them were ever pre&s;&s;ing the purging the Kirk, as they called it, that is the ejecting all the Epi&s;copal Clergy. Then they took up the term of Malig|nants, by which all who differed from them were di&s;tingui&s;hed: But the &s;trictne&s;s of piety and good life, which had gained them &s;o much reputation before the war, began to wear off; and in|&s;tead of that a fiercene&s;s of temper, and a copiou&s;ne&s;s of many long &s;ermons, and much longer prayers, came to be the di&s;tinction of the party. This they carried even to the &s;aying grace before and after meat &s;ome times to the length of a whole hour. But as every new war broke out, there was a vi&s;ible abatement of even the outward &s;hews of piety. Thus the war corrupted both &s;ides. When the war broke out in <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> had a great mind to go into it. The decayed nobility, the military men, and the Mini&s;ters, were violently &s;et on it. They &s;aw what good quar|ters they had in the north of <HI>England.</HI> And they hoped the umpirage of the war would fall into their hands. The divi&s;ion appearing &s;o near an equality in <HI>England,</HI> they reckoned they
<PB N="36" REF="52">
would turn the &s;cales, and &s;o be courted of both &s;ides: And they did not doubt to draw great advantages from it, both for the Nation in general, and them&s;elves in particular. Duke <HI>Ha|milton</HI> was tru&s;ted by the King with the management of his affairs in that Kingdom, and had powers to offer; but &s;o &s;ecretly that if di&s;covered it could not be proved, for fear of di&s;gu&s;t|ing the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that if they would engage in the King's &s;ide <NOTE PLACE="marg">Conditions offered to the <HI>Scots.</HI></NOTE> he would con&s;ent to the uniting <HI>Northumberland, $umberland,</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmerland,</HI> to <HI>Scotland;</HI> and that <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> &s;hould be the &s;eat of the Government; that the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> &s;hould hold his Court always among them; that every third year the King &s;hou'd go among them; and every office in the King's hou&s;hold &s;hould in the third turn be given to a <HI>Scotchman.</HI> This I found not among Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s papers: But the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> a&s;&s;ured me of it, and that at the I&s;le of <HI>Wight</HI> they had all the en|gagements from the King that he could give. Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> quickly &s;aw, it was a vain imagination to hope that Kingdom could be brought to e&s;pou&s;e the King's quarrel. The inclination ran &s;trong the other way: All he hoped to &s;ucceed in was to keep them neuter for &s;ome time: And this he &s;aw could not hold long: So after he had kept off their engaging with <HI>England</HI> all the year 1643, he and his friends &s;aw it was in vain to &s;truggle any longer. The cour&s;e they all re&s;olved on was, that the nobility &s;hould fall in heartily with the inclinations of the Nation to join with <HI>England,</HI> that &s;o they might procure to them&s;elves and their friends the chief commands in the army: And then, when they were in <HI>England,</HI> and that their army was as a di&s;tinct body &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the Kingdom, it might bo much ca&s;ier to gain them to the King's &s;ervice than it was at that time to work on the whole Nation.</P>
<P>This was not a very &s;incere way of proceeding: But it was in|tended for the King's &s;ervice, and would probably have had the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Montro&s;e</HI>'s underta|kings.</NOTE> effect de&s;igned by it, if &s;ome accidents had not happened that changed the face of affairs, which are not rightly under&s;tood: And therefore I will open them clearly. The Earl of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> and a party of high Royali&s;ts were for entring into an open breach with the country in the beginning of the year 1643, but offered no probable methods of maintaining it; nor could they reckon them&s;elves a&s;&s;ured of any con&s;iderable party. They were full of undertakings: But when they were pre&s;&s;ed to &s;hew what concurrence might be depended on, nothing was offered but from the <HI>Highlanders:</HI> And on this wi&s;e men could not rely: So Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> would not expo&s;e the King's affairs by &s;uch a de&s;perate way of proceeding. Upon this they went to
<PB N="37" REF="53">
<HI>Oxford,</HI> and filled all people there with complaints of the trea|chery of the <HI>Hamiltons;</HI> and they pretended they could have &s;ecured <HI>Scotland,</HI> if their propo&s;itions had been entertained. This was but too &s;uitable to the King's own inclinations, and to the humour that was then prevailing at <HI>Oxford.</HI> So when the two <HI>Hamiltons</HI> came up, they were not admitted to &s;peak to the King: And it was believed, if the younger brother had not made his e&s;|cape, that both would have &s;uffered; for when the Queen heard of his e&s;cape, &s;he with great commotion &s;aid, <HI>Abercorn</HI> has mi&s;&s;ed a Dukedom; for that Earl was a Papi&s;t, and next to the two brothers. They could have demon&s;trated, if heard, that they were &s;ure of above two parts in three of the officers of the army; and did not doubt to have engaged the army in the King's cau&s;e. But the failing in this was not all. The Earl then made Marquis of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> had powers given him &s;uch as he de&s;ired and was &s;ent down with them: But he could do nothing till the end of the year. A great body of the <HI>Macdo|nalds</HI> commanded by one Col. <HI>Killoch</HI> came over from <HI>Ireland</HI> to recover <HI>Kentire,</HI> the be&s;t country of all the <HI>Highlands,</HI> out of which they had been driven by the <HI>Argile</HI> family, who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their country about fifty years. The head of the&s;e was the Earl of <HI>Antrim,</HI> who had married the Duke of <HI>Backing|ham</HI>'s widow: And being a Papi&s;t, and having a great com|mand in <HI>Ul&s;ter,</HI> was much relied on by the Queen. He was the main per&s;on in the fir&s;t rebellion, and was the mo&s;t engaged in blood-&s;hed of any in the north: Yet he continued to corre&s;pond with the Queen to the great prejudice of the King's affair's. When the Marquis of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> heard they were in <HI>Argile&s;hire,</HI> he went to them, and told them, if they would let him lead them he would carry them into the heart of the Kingdom, and procure them better quarters and good pay: So he led them in|to <HI>Perth&s;hire.</HI> The <HI>Scots</HI> had at that time an army in <HI>England,</HI> and another in <HI>Ireland:</HI> Yet they did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to call home any part of either, but de&s;pi&s;ing the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>High|landers,</HI> they rai&s;ed a tumultuary army, and put it under the command of &s;ome Lords noted for want of courage, and of others who wi&s;hed well to the other &s;ide. The Marquis of <HI>Mon|tro&s;e</HI>'s men were de&s;perate, and met with little re&s;i&s;tance: So that &s;mall body of the Covenanters army was routed. And here the Marquis of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> got hor&s;es and ammunition, having but three hor&s;es before, and powder only for one charge. Then he became con&s;iderable: And he marched through the northern parts by <HI>Aberdeen.</HI> The Marquis of <HI>Huntly</HI> was in the King's in|tere&s;ts; but would not join with him, tho' his &s;ons did. A&s;tro|logy

ruined him: He believed the &s;tars, and they deceived him: He &s;aid often, that neither the King, nor the <HI>Hamiltons,</HI> nor <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> would pro&s;per: He believed he &s;hould outlive them all, and e&s;cape at la&s;t; as it happened in conclu&s;ion, as to out|living the others. He was naturally a gallant man: But the &s;tars had &s;o &s;ubdued him, that he made a poor figure during the whole cour&s;e of the wars.</P>
<P>The Marquis of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI>'s &s;ucce&s;s was very mi&s;chievous, and proved the ruin of the King's affairs: On which I &s;hould not have <NOTE PLACE="marg">Good ad|vices given to the King.</NOTE> depended entirely, if I had had this only from the Earl of <HI>Lau|derdale,</HI> who was indeed my fir&s;t author: But it was fully con|firmed to me by the Lord <HI>Hollis,</HI> who had gone in with great heat into the beginnings of the war: But he &s;oon &s;aw the ill con|&s;equences it already had, and the wor&s;e that were like to grow with the progre&s;s of it: He had in the beginning of the year forty three, when he was &s;ent to <HI>Oxford</HI> with the propo&s;itions, taken great pains on all about the King to convince them of the nece&s;&s;ity of their yielding in time; &s;ince the longer they &s;tood out the conditions would be harder: And when he was &s;ent by the Parliament in the end of the year forty four, with other propo&s;itions, he and <HI>Whitlock</HI> entered into &s;ecret confe|rences with the King, of which &s;ome account is given by <HI>Whit|lock</HI> in his memoirs. They with other commi&s;&s;ioners that were &s;ent to <HI>Oxford</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the King, and all that were in great credit with him, with this, that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary the King &s;hould put an end to the war by a treaty: A new par|ty of hot men was &s;pringing up, that were plainly for change|ing the Government: They were growing much in the army, but were yet far from carrying any thing in the hou&s;e: They had gained much &s;trength this &s;ummer: And they might make a great progre&s;s by the accidents that another year might pro|duce: They confe&s;&s;ed there were many things hard to be di|ge&s;ted, that mu&s;t be done in order to a peace: They a&s;ked things that were unrea&s;onable: But they were forced to con&s;ent to tho&s;e demands: Otherwi&s;e they would have lo&s;t their credit with the City and the people, who could not be &s;atisfied with|out a very entire &s;ecurity, and a full &s;atisfaction: But the ex|tremity to which matters might be carried otherwi&s;e made it nece&s;&s;ary to come to a peace on any terms what&s;oever; &s;ince no terms could be &s;o bad as the continuance of the war: The King mu&s;t tru&s;t them, tho' they were not at that time di&s;po|&s;ed to tru&s;t him &s;o much as it were to be wi&s;hed: They &s;aid far|ther, that if a peace &s;hould follow, it would be a much ea&s;ier thing to get any hard laws now moved for to be repealed,
<PB N="39" REF="55">
than it was now to hinder their being infi&s;ted on. With the&s;e things <HI>Hollis</HI> told me that the King and many of his coun|&s;ellours, who &s;aw how his affairs declined, and with what diffi|culty they could hope to continue the war another year, were &s;atisfied. The King more particularly began to feel the in&s;o|lence of the military men, and of tho&s;e who were daily re|proaching him with their &s;ervices; &s;o that they were become as unea&s;y to him as tho&s;e of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> had been formerly. But &s;ome came in the interval from Lord <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> with &s;uch an account of what he had done, of the &s;trength he had, and of his hopes next &s;ummer, that the King was by that prevailed on to believe his affairs would mend, and that he might after|wards treat on better terms. This unhappily wrought &s;o far, <NOTE PLACE="marg">But not fol|lowed.</NOTE> that the limitations he put on tho&s;e he &s;ent to treat at <HI>Uxbridge</HI> made the whole de&s;ign mi&s;carry. That rai&s;ed the &s;pirits of tho&s;e that were already but too much exa&s;perated. The Marquis of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> made a great progre&s;s the next year: But he laid no la&s;ting foundation, for he did not make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the &s;trong places or pa&s;&s;es of the Kingdom. After his la&s;t and greate&s;t victory at <HI>Kil&s;yth</HI> he was lifted up out of mea&s;ure. The <HI>Macdonalds</HI> were every where fierce ma&s;ters, and ravenous plunderers: And the other <HI>Highlanders,</HI> who did not &s;uch mi|litary executions, yet were good at robbing: And when they had got as much as they could carry home on their backs, they de&s;erted. The <HI>Macdonalds</HI> al&s;o left him to go and execute their revenge on the <HI>Argile</HI>'s country. The Marquis of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> thought he was now ma&s;ter, but had no &s;cheme how to fix his conque&s;ts: He wa&s;ted the e&s;tates of his enemies, chiefly the <HI>Ha|miltons;</HI> and went towards the borders of <HI>England,</HI> tho' he had but a &s;mall force left about him: But he thought his name car|ried terrour with it. So he writ to the King that he had gone over the land from <HI>Dan</HI> to <HI>Beer&s;heba:</HI> He prayed the King to come down in the&s;e words, <HI>come thou, and take the City, le&s;t I take it, and it be called by my name.</HI> This letter was writ, but never &s;ent; for he was routed, and his papers taken, before he had di&s;patched the courier. When his papers were taken, many letters of the King, and of others at <HI>Oxford,</HI> were found, as the Earl of <HI>Crawford,</HI> one appointed to read them, told me; which increa&s;ed the di&s;gu&s;ts: But the&s;e were not publi&s;hed. Up|on this occa&s;ion many pri&s;oners that had quarters given them were murdered in cold blood: And as they &s;ent them to &s;ome towns that had been ill u&s;ed by Lord <HI>Montro&s;e</HI>'s army, the people in revenge fell on them and knock'd them on the head. Several per&s;ons of quality were condemned for being with them: And they were

proceeded again&s;t both with &s;everity and with indignities. The preachers thundred in their pulpits again&s;t all that did the work of the Lord deceitfully; and cried out again&s;t all that were for moderate proceedings, as guilty of the blood that had been &s;hed. <HI>Thine eye &s;hall not pity, and thou &s;halt not &s;pare,</HI> were often in|culcated after every execution: They triumphed with &s;o little decency, that it gave all people very ill impre&s;&s;ions of them. But this was not the wor&s;t effect of Lord <HI>Montro&s;e</HI>'s expedition. It lo&s;t the opportunity at <HI>Uxbridge:</HI> It alienated the <HI>Scots</HI> much from the King: It exalted all that were enemies to peace. Now they &s;eemed to have &s;ome colour for all tho&s;e a&s;per&s;ions they had ca&s;t on the King, as if he had been in a corre&s;pondence with the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> rebels, when the wor&s;t tribe of them had been thus employed by him. His affairs declined totally in <HI>England</HI> that &s;ummer: And Lord <HI>Hollis</HI> &s;aid to me, all was owing to Lord <HI>Montro&s;e</HI>'s unhappy &s;ucce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion I will relate &s;omewhat concerning the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Antrim</HI>'s corre&s;pon|dence with the King and Queen.</NOTE> Earl of <HI>Antrim.</HI> I had in my hand &s;everal of his letters to the King in the year 1646, writ in a very confident &s;tyle. One was &s;omewhat particular: He in a po&s;t&s;cript de&s;ired the King to &s;end the inclo&s;ed to the good woman, without making any excu&s;e for the pre&s;umption; by which, as follows in the po&s;t&s;cript, he meant his wife, the Duche&s;s of <HI>Buckingham.</HI> This made me more ea&s;y to believe a &s;tory that the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> told me he had from the Earl of <HI>Northumberland:</HI> Upon the Re&s;toration, in the year 1660, Lord <HI>Antrim</HI> was thought guilty of &s;o much blood|&s;hed, that it was taken for granted he could not be included in the indemnity that was to pa&s;s in <HI>Ireland:</HI> Upon this he (Lord <HI>Antrim)</HI> &s;eeing the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> &s;et again&s;t him, came over to <HI>London,</HI> and was lodged at <HI>Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e:</HI> And it was be|lieved, that having no children he &s;ettled his e&s;tate on <HI>Jermyn</HI> then Earl of St. <HI>Albans:</HI> But before he came away, he had made a prior &s;ettlement in favour of his brother. He petitioned the King to order a Committee of Council to examine the warrants that he had acted upon. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> was for rejec|ting the petition, as containing a high indignity to the memo|ry of King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t: And &s;aid plainly at Council table, that if any per&s;on had pretended to affirm &s;uch a thing while they were at <HI>Oxford,</HI> he would either have been &s;everely puni&s;h|ed for it, or the King would &s;oon have had a very thin Court. But it &s;eemed ju&s;t to &s;ee what he had to &s;ay for him&s;elf: So a committee was named, of which the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> was the chief. He produced to them &s;ome of the King's letters: But they did not come up to a full proof. In one of them the
<PB N="41" REF="57">
King wrote, that he had not then lei&s;ure, but referred him&s;elf to the Queen's letter; and &s;aid, that was all one as if he writ him&s;elf. Upon this foundation he produced a &s;eries of letters writ by him&s;elf to the Queen, in which he gave her an account of every one of the&s;e particulars that were laid to his charge, and &s;hewed the grounds he went on, and de&s;ired her directions to every one of the&s;e: He had an&s;wers ordering him to do as he did. This the Queen-mother e&s;pou&s;ed with great zeal; and &s;aid, &s;he was bound in honour to &s;ave him. I &s;aw a great deal of that management, for I was then at Court. But it was gene|rally believed, that this train of letters was made up at that time in a collu&s;ion between the Queen and him: So a report was prepared to be &s;igned by the Committee, &s;etting forth that he had &s;o fully ju&s;tified him&s;elf in every thing that had been objected to him, that he ought not to be excepted out of the in|demnity. This was brought fir&s;t to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> to be &s;igned by him: But he refu&s;ed it; and &s;aid, he was &s;or|ry he had produced &s;uch warrants, but he did not think they could &s;erve his turn; for he did not believe any warrant from the King or Queen could ju&s;tify &s;o much blood&s;hed, in &s;o ma|ny black in&s;tances as were laid again&s;t him. Upon his refu|&s;al the re&s;t of the Committee did not think fit to &s;ign the report: So it was let fall: And the King was prevailed on to write to the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> telling him that he had &s;o vindicated him|&s;elf, that he mu&s;t endeavour to get him to be included in the indemnity. That was done; and was no &s;mall reproach to the King, that did thus &s;acrifice his father's honour to his mother's importunity. Upon this the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> told me, that he had <NOTE PLACE="marg">The origi|nal of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> $span$|&s;acre.</NOTE> taken all the pains he could to enquire into the original of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> ma&s;&s;acre, but could never &s;ee any rea&s;on to believe the King had any acce&s;&s;ion to it. He did indeed believe that the Queen hearkened to the propo&s;itions made by the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> who undertook to take the Government of <HI>Ireland</HI> into their hands, which they thought they could ea&s;ily perform: And then, they &s;aid, they, would a&s;&s;i&s;t the King to &s;ubdue the hot &s;pirits at <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter.</HI> With this the plot of the in&s;urrection began: And all the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> believed the Queen encouraged it. But in the fir&s;t de|&s;ign there was no thought of a ma&s;&s;acre: That came in head as they were laying the methods of executing it: So, as tho&s;e were managed by the Prie&s;ts, they were the chief men that &s;et on the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> to all the blood and cruelty that followed.</P>
<P>I know nothing in particular of the &s;equel of the war, nor of all the confu&s;ions that happened till the murder of King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t: Only one pa&s;&s;age I had from Lieutenant General <HI>Dru|mond,</HI>

afterwards Lord <HI>Strathallan.</HI> He &s;erved on the King's &s;ide: But he had many friends among tho&s;e who were for the Covenant: So the King's affairs being now ruined, he was re|commended to <HI>Cromwell</HI> being then in a treaty with the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour, who was negotiating for &s;ome regiments to be levied and &s;ent over from <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Flanders:</HI> He happened to be with <HI>Cromwell</HI> when the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;ent from <HI>Scotland</HI> to prote&s;t again&s;t the putting the King to death came to argue the matter with him. <HI>Cromwell</HI> bade <HI>Drumond</HI> &s;tay and hear their conference, which he did. They began in a heavy languid &s;tyle to lay indeed great load on the King: But they &s;till in&s;i&s;t|ed on that clau&s;e in the Covenant, by which they &s;wore they would be faithful in the pre&s;ervation of his Maje&s;ty's per&s;on: With this they &s;hewed upon what terms <HI>Scotland,</HI> as well as the two Hou&s;es, had engaged in the war; and what &s;olemn declara|tions of their zeal and duty to the King they all along publi&s;h|ed; which would now appear, to the &s;candal and reproach of the chri&s;tian name, to have been fal&s;e pretences, if when the King was in their power they &s;hould proceed to extremities. Upon <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cromwell</HI> ar|gues with the <HI>Scots</HI> concerning the King's death.</NOTE> this <HI>Cromwell</HI> entered into a long di&s;cour&s;e of the nature of the regal power, according to the principles of <HI>Mariana</HI> and <HI>Bu|chanan:</HI> He thought a breach of tru&s;t in a King ought to be puni&s;hed more than any other crime what&s;oever: He &s;aid as to their Covenant, they &s;wore to the pre&s;ervation of the King's per&s;on in defence of the true religion: If then it appeared that the &s;ettlement of the true religion was ob&s;tructed by the King, &s;o that they could not come at it but by putting him out of the way, then their oath could not bind them to the pre&s;er|ving him any longer. He &s;aid al&s;o, their Covenant did bind them to bring all malignants, incendiaries, and enemies to the cau&s;e, to condign puni&s;hment: And was not this to be executed impartially? What were all tho&s;e on whom publick ju&s;tice had been done, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who &s;uffered for joining with <HI>Mon|tro&s;e,</HI> but &s;mall offenders acting by commi&s;&s;ion from the King, who was therefore the principal, and &s;o the mo&s;t guilty? <HI>Dru|mond</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Cromwell</HI> had plainly the better of them at their own weapon, and upon their own principles. At this time presbytery was in its height at <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;ummer 1648, when the Parliament declared they would engage to re&s;cue the King from his impri&s;onment, and the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The oppo&s;i|tion of the General A&s;+&s;embly to the Parlia|ment.</NOTE> Parliament of <HI>England</HI> from the force it was put under by the army, the Nobility went into the de&s;ign, all except &s;ix or eight.

formerly mentioned: And particular favours were promi&s;|ed to every one that concurred in it. The Marquis of <HI>Argile</HI> gave it out that the <HI>Hamiltons,</HI> let them pretend what they would, had no &s;incere intentions to their cau&s;e, but had engage|ed to &s;erve the King on his own terms: He filled the preachers with &s;uch jealou&s;ies of this, that tho' all the demands that they made for the &s;ecurity of their cau&s;e, and in declaring the grounds of the war, were complied with, yet they could not be &s;atisfied, but &s;till &s;aid the <HI>Hamiltons</HI> were in a confederacy with the malignants in <HI>England,</HI> and did not intend to &s;tand to what they promi&s;ed. The General A&s;&s;embly declared again&s;t it, as an unlawful confederacy with the enemies of God; and called in the Unlawful Engagement, which came to be the name com|monly given to it in all their pulpits. They every where preach|ed again&s;t it, and oppo&s;ed the levies all they could by &s;olemn denunciations of the wrath and cur&s;e of God on all concerned in them. This was a &s;trange piece of oppo&s;ition to the &s;tate, lit|tle-inferiour to what was pretended to, and put in practice by the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;outh-we&s;t counties of <HI>Scotland</HI> have &s;eldom corn enough to &s;erve them round the year: And the northern parts produ|cing more than they need, tho&s;e in the we&s;t come in the &s;ummer to buy at <HI>Lieth</HI> the &s;tores that come from the north: And from a word <HI>Whiggam,</HI> u&s;ed in driving their hor&s;es all that drove were called the <HI>Whiggamors,</HI> and &s;horter the <HI>Whiggs.</HI> Now in that year, after the news came down of Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s defeat, the Mini&s;|ters animated their people to ri&s;e, and march to <HI>Edenburgh:</HI> And they came up marching on the head of their pari&s;hes, with an unheard-of fury, praying and preaching all the way as they came.

This was called the <HI>Whigga|mor</HI>'s inroad: And ever after that all that oppo&s;ed the Court came in contempt to be called <HI>Whiggs:</HI> And from <HI>Scotland</HI> the word was brought into <HI>England,</HI> where it is now one of our unhappy terms of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>The Committee of their e&s;tates, with the force they had in their hands, could ea&s;ily have di&s;&s;ipated this undi&s;ciplin'd herd.

Sir <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> and others who were for a change of Govern|ment, had no mind to treat any more. But both city and coun|try were &s;o de&s;irous of a per&s;onal treaty, that it could not be re&s;i&s;ted. <HI>Vane, Pierpoint,</HI> and &s;ome others went to the treaty on purpo&s;e to delay matters till the army could be brought up to <HI>Lon|don.</HI> All that wi&s;h'd well to the treaty prayed the King at their fir&s;t coming to di&s;patch the bu&s;ine&s;s with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te, and to grant the fir&s;t day all that he could bring him&s;elf to grant on the la&s;t. <HI>Hollis</HI> and <HI>Grim&s;tone</HI> told me, they had both on their knees begged this of the King. They &s;aid, they knew <HI>Vane</HI> would &s;tudy to draw out the treaty to a great length: And he, who declared for an unbounded liberty of con&s;cience, would try to gain on the King's party by the offer of a toleration for the common prayer and the epi&s;copal clergy. His de&s;ign in that was to gain time, till <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;hould &s;ettle <HI>Scotland</HI> and the north. But they &s;aid, if the King would frankly come in with|out the formality of papers backward and forward, and &s;end them back next day with the conce&s;&s;ions that were ab&s;olute|ly nece&s;&s;ary, they did not doubt but he &s;hould in a very few days be brought up with honour freedom and &s;afety to the Parliament, and that matters &s;hould be brought to a pre&s;ent &s;ettlement. <HI>Ti|tus,</HI> who was then much tru&s;ted by the King, and employed in a negotiation with the pre&s;byterian party, told me he had
<PB N="45" REF="61">
&s;poke often and earne&s;tly to him in the &s;ame &s;train: But the King could not come to a re&s;olution: And he &s;till fancied, that in the &s;truggle between the Hou&s;e of Commons and the Army both &s;aw they needed him &s;o much to give them the &s;uperiour &s;trength, that he imagined by balancing them he would bring both &s;ides into a greater dependence on him&s;elf, and force them to better terms. In this <HI>Vane</HI> flattered the epi&s;copal party, to the King's ruin as well as their own. But they &s;till hated the Pre&s;|byterians as the fir&s;t authors of the war; and &s;eemed unwilling to think well of them, or to be beholding to them. Thus the treaty went on with a fatal &s;lowne&s;s: And by the time it was come to &s;ome maturity, <HI>Cromwell</HI> came up with his army and over|turned all.</P>
<P>Upon this I will &s;et down what Sir <HI>Harbotle Grim&s;ton</HI> told me <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cromwell</HI>'s di&s;&s;imula|tion.</NOTE> a few weeks before his death: Whether it was done at this time or the year before I cannot tell: I rather believe the latter. When the Hou&s;e of Commons and the Army were a quarrelling, at a meeting of the officers it was propo&s;ed to purge the army better, that they might know whom to depend on. <HI>Cromwell</HI> upon that &s;aid, he was &s;ure of the Army; but there was another body that had more need of purging, naming the Hou&s;e of Commons, and he thought the Army only could do that. Two officers that were pre&s;ent brought an account of this to <HI>Grim&s;ton,</HI> who carried them with him to the Lobby of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, they being re&s;olved to ju&s;tify it to the Hou&s;e. There was another debate then on foot: But <HI>Grim&s;ton</HI> diverted it, and &s;aid, he had a matter of privilege of the highe&s;t &s;ort to lay before them: It was about the being and freedom of the Hou&s;e. So he charged <HI>Cromwell</HI> with the de&s;ign of putting a force on the Hou&s;e: He had his witne&s;&s;es at the door, and de&s;ired they might be examined: They were brought to the barr, and ju&s;|tified all that they had &s;aid to him, and gave a full relation of all that had pa&s;s'd at their meetings. When they withdrew, <HI>Crom|well</HI> fell down on his knees, and made a &s;olemn prayer to God, atte&s;ting his innocence, and his zeal for the &s;ervice of the hou&s;e: He &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to the providence of God, who it &s;eems thought fit to exerci&s;e him with calumny and &s;lander, but he committed his cau&s;e to him: This he did with great vehemence, and with many tears. After this &s;trange and bold preamble he made &s;o long a &s;peech, ju&s;tifying both him&s;elf and the re&s;t of the officers, except a few that &s;eemed inclined to return back to <HI>Egypt,</HI> that he wearied out the Hou&s;e, and wrought &s;o much on his party, that what the witne&s;&s;es had &s;aid was &s;o little believed, that had it been moved <HI>Grim&s;ton</HI> thought that both he and
<PB N="46" REF="62">
they would have been &s;ent to the <HI>Tower.</HI> But whether their guilt made them mode&s;t, or that they had no mind to have the matter much talked of, they let it fall: And there was no &s;trength in the other &s;ide to carry it farther. To compleat the &s;cene, as &s;oon as ever <HI>Cromwell</HI> got out of the Hou&s;e, he re&s;olved to tru&s;t him&s;elf no more among them; but went to the Army, and in a few days he brought them up, and forced a great many from the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I had much di&s;cour&s;e on this head with one who knew <HI>Crom|well</HI> well and all that &s;et of men; and a&s;ked him how they could excu&s;e all the prevarications, and other ill things of which they were vi&s;ibly guilty in the conduct of their affairs. He told me, they believed there were great occa&s;ions in which &s;ome men were called to great &s;ervices, in the doing of which they were excu&s;ed from the common rules of morality: Such were the practices of <HI>Ehud</HI> and <HI>Jael, Sam&s;on</HI> and <HI>David:</HI> And by this they fancied they had a privilege from ob&s;erving the &s;tand|ing rules. It is very obvious how far this principle may be car|ried, and how all ju&s;tice and mercy may be laid a&s;ide on this pre|tence by every bold enthu&s;ia&s;t. <HI>Ludlow</HI> in his memoirs ju&s;tifies this force put on the Parliament, as much as he condemns the force that <HI>Cromwell</HI> and the Army afterwards put on the Hou&s;e: And he &s;eems to lay this down for a maxim, that the military pow|er ought always to be &s;ubject to the civil: And yet, without any &s;ort of re&s;entment for what he had done, he owns the &s;hare he had in the force put on the Parliament at this time. The plain reconciling of this is, that he thought when the Army judged the Parliament was in the wrong they might u&s;e violence, but not otherwi&s;e: Which gives the Army a &s;uperiour authority, and an in&s;pection into the proceedings of the Parliament. This &s;hews how impo&s;&s;ible it is to &s;et up a Commonwealth in <HI>England:</HI> For that cannot be brought about but by a military force: And they will ever keep the Parliament in &s;ubjection to them, and &s;o keep up their own authority.</P>
<P>I will leave all that relates to the King's trial and death to common hi&s;torians, knowing nothing that is particular of that great tran&s;action, which was certainly one of the mo&s;t amazing &s;cenes in hi&s;tory. <HI>Ireton</HI> was the per&s;on that drove it on: For <NOTE PLACE="marg">The men chiefly en|gaged in the taking the King's life.</NOTE> <HI>Cromwell</HI> was all the while in &s;ome &s;u&s;pence about it. <HI>Ireton</HI> had the principles and the temper of a <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius</HI> in him: He &s;tuck at nothing that might have turned <HI>England</HI> to a Commonwealth: And he found out <HI>Cook</HI> and <HI>Brad&s;haw,</HI> two bold lawyers, as pro|per in&s;truments for managing it. <HI>Fair$ax</HI> was much di&s;tracted in his mind, and changed purpo&s;es often every day. The Presby|terians
<PB N="47" REF="63">
and the body of the City were much again&s;t it, and were e|very where fa&s;ting and praying for the King's pre&s;ervation. There was not above 8000 of the Army about the town: But the&s;e were &s;elected out of the whole Army, as the mo&s;t engaged in enthu&s;ia&s;m: And they were kept at prayer in their way almo&s;t day and night, except when they were upon duty: So that they were wrought up to a pitch of fury, that &s;truck a terrour into all people. On the other hand the King's party was without &s;pirit: And, as many of them&s;elves have &s;aid to me, they could never be|lieve his death was really intended till it was too late. They thought all was a pageantry to &s;trike a terrour, and to force the King to &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions as they had a mind to extort from him.</P>
<P>The King him&s;elf &s;hewed a calm and a compo&s;ed firmne&s;s, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's behaviour.</NOTE> amazed all people; and that &s;o much the more, becau&s;e it was not natural to him. It was imputed to a very extraordinary mea|&s;ure of &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Bi&s;hop <HI>Juxon</HI> did the duty of his function hone&s;tly, but with a dry coldne&s;s that could not rai&s;e the King's thoughts: So that it was owing wholly to &s;omewhat within him&s;elf that he went thro' &s;o many indignities with &s;o much true greatne&s;s, without di&s;order or any &s;ort of affectati|on. Thus he died greater than he had lived; and &s;hewed, that which has been often ob&s;erved of the whole race of the <HI>Stewards,</HI> that they bore misfortunes better than pro&s;perity. His reign both in peace and war was a continual &s;eries of errours: So that it does not appear that he had a true judgment of things. He was out of mea&s;ure &s;et on following his humour, but unrea&s;ona|bly feeble to tho&s;e whom he tru&s;ted, chiefly to the Queen. He had too high a notion of the regal power, and thought that eve|ry oppo&s;ition to it was rebellion. He minded little things too much, and was more concerned in the drawing of a paper than in fighting a battel. He had a firm aver&s;ion to Popery, but was much inclined to a middle way between Prote&s;tants and Papi&s;ts, by which he lo&s;t the one without gaining the other. His engaging the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> in the war of <HI>Ro|chelle,</HI> and then a&s;&s;i&s;ting him &s;o poorly, and for&s;aking him at la&s;t, gave an ill character of him to all the Prote&s;tants abroad. The Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> told me, the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> was at <HI>Ge|neva,</HI> where he him&s;elf was, when he received a very long let|ter or rather a little book from my father, which gave him a copious account of the beginning of the troubles in <HI>Scotland:</HI> He tran&s;lated it to the Duke of <HI>Rohan,</HI> who expre&s;&s;ed a vehe|ment indignation at the Court of <HI>England</HI> for their u&s;age of him: Of which this was the account he then gave.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="64">
The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> had a &s;ecret conver&s;ation with the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The affair of <HI>Rochelle.</HI></NOTE> Queen of <HI>France,</HI> of which the Queen-mother was very jealous, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the King with &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of it, that he was or|dered immediately to leave the Court. Upon his return to <HI>Eng|land</HI> under this affront he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the King with &s;uch a ha|tred of that Court, that the Queen was ill u&s;ed on her coming over, and all her &s;ervants were &s;ent back. He told him al&s;o that the Prote&s;tants were &s;o ill u&s;ed, and &s;o &s;trong, that if he would protect them they would involve that Kingdom in new wars; which he repre&s;ented as &s;o glorious a beginning of his reign, that the King without weighing the con&s;equence of it &s;ent one to treat with the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> about it. Great a&s;&s;i&s;tance was promi&s;ed by &s;ea: So a war was re&s;olved on, in which the &s;hare that our Court had is well enough known. But the in famous part was, that <HI>Richlieu</HI> got the King of <HI>France</HI> to make his Queen write an obliging letter to the Duke of <HI>Buc|kingham,</HI> a&s;&s;uring him that, if he would let <HI>Rochelle</HI> fall without a&s;&s;i&s;ting it, he &s;hould have leave to come over, and &s;hould &s;et|tle the whole matter of the religion according to their edicts. This was a &s;trange proceeding: But <HI>Cardinal Richlieu</HI> could turn that weak King as he plea&s;ed. Upon this the Duke made that &s;hameful campaign of the i&s;le of <HI>Rhe.</HI> But finding next winter that he was not to be &s;uffered to go over into <HI>France,</HI> and that he was abu&s;ed into a fal&s;e hope, he re&s;olved to have followed that matter with more vigour, when he was &s;tabbed by <HI>Felton.</HI></P>
<P>There is another &s;tory told of the King's conduct during the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A de&s;ign of making the <HI>Sp$span$ Ne|therlands</HI> a Common|wealth.</NOTE> peaceable part of his reign, which I had from <HI>Halewyn</HI> of <HI>Dort,</HI> who was one of the judges in the Court of <HI>Holland,</HI> and was the wi&s;e&s;t and greate&s;t man I knew among them. He told me, he had it from his father, who being then the chief man of <HI>Dort</HI> was of the States, and had the &s;ecret communicated to him. When <HI>I&s;abella Clara Eugenia</HI> grew old, and began to decline, a great many of her council, apprehending what mi&s;eries they would fall under when they &s;hould be again in the hands of the <HI>Spa|$aids,</HI> formed a de&s;ign of making them&s;elves a free Common|wealth, that, in imitation of the union among the Cantons of <HI>Switzerland</HI> that were of both religions, there &s;hould be a perpetual confederacy between them and the States of the &s;even provinces. This they communicated to <HI>Henry Frederick</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and to &s;ome of the States, who approved of it, but thought it nece&s;&s;ary to engage the King of <HI>England</HI> in it. The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> told the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour, that there was a matter of great con&s;equence that was fit to be laid before the King; but it was of &s;uch a nature, and &s;uch per&s;ons were
<PB N="49" REF="65">
concerned in it, that it could not be communicated unle&s;s the King would be plea&s;ed to promi&s;e ab&s;olute &s;ecrecy for the pre|&s;ent. This the King did: And then the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;ent him the whole &s;cheme. The &s;ecret was ill kept: Either the King tru&s;ted it to &s;ome who di&s;covered it, or the paper was &s;tollen from him; for it was &s;ent over to the Court of <HI>Bruxells:</HI> One of the Mini&s;try lo&s;t his head for it: And &s;ome took the alarm &s;o quickly that they got to <HI>Holland</HI> out of danger. After this the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had no commerce with our Court, and often lamented that &s;o great a de&s;ign was &s;o unhappily lo&s;t. He had as ill an opinion of the King's conduct of the war; for when the Queen came over, and brought &s;ome of the generals with her, the Prince &s;aid, after he had talked with them, (as the late King told me,) he did not wonder to &s;ee the affairs of <HI>England</HI> decline as they did, &s;ince he had talked with the King's gene|rals.</P>
<P>I will not enter farther into the military part: For I remem|ber an advice of Mar&s;hall <HI>Scomberg</HI>'s, never to meddle in the relation of military matters. He &s;aid, &s;ome affected to relate tho&s;e affairs in all the terms of war, in which they committed great errours that expo&s;ed them to the &s;corn of all comman|ders, who mu&s;t de&s;pi&s;e relations that pretend to an exactne&s;s when there were blunders in every part of them.</P>
<P>In the King's death the ill effect of extreme violent coun&s;els <NOTE PLACE="marg">The ill ef|fects of vi|olent coun|&s;els.</NOTE> di&s;covered it&s;elf. <HI>Ireton</HI> hoped that by this all men concerned in it would become irreconcileable to monarchy, and would act as de&s;perate men, and de&s;troy all that might revenge that blood. But this had a very different effect. Something of the &s;ame nature had happened in lower in&s;tances before: But they were not the wi&s;er for it. The Earl of <HI>Stra&s;ford</HI>'s death made all his former errours be forgot: It rai&s;ed his character, and ca&s;t a la&s;ting odium on that way of proceeding; whereas he had &s;unk in his credit by any cen&s;ure lower than death, and had been lit|tle pitied, if not thought ju&s;tly puni&s;hed. The like effect fol|lowed upon Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI>'s death. He was a learned, a &s;in|cere and zealous man, regular in his own life, and humble in his private deportment; but was a hot, indi&s;creet man, eagerly pur&s;uing &s;ome matters that were either very incon&s;iderable or mi&s;|chievous, &s;uch as &s;etting the communion table by the ea&s;t walls of churches, bowing to it, and calling it the Altar, the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the <HI>Walloons</HI> privileges, the breaking of lectures, the encoura|ging of &s;ports on the Lord's day, with &s;ome other things that were of no value: And yet all the zeal and heat of that time was laid out on the&s;e. His &s;everity in the Star-chamber and
<PB N="50" REF="66">
in the High-Commi&s;&s;ion-Court, but above all his violent and indeed inexcu&s;able inju&s;tice in the pro&s;ecution of Bi&s;hop <HI>Willi|ams,</HI> were &s;uch vi&s;ible blemi&s;hes, that nothing but the putting him to death in &s;o unju&s;t a manner could have rai&s;ed his cha|racter; which indeed it did to a degree of &s;etting him up as a pat|tern, and the e&s;tabli&s;hing all his notions as &s;tandards, by which judgments are to be made of men whether they are true to the church or not. His diary, tho' it was a ba&s;e thing to publi&s;h it, repre&s;ents him as an abject fawner on the Duke of <HI>Bucking|ham,</HI> and as a &s;uper&s;titious regarder of dreams: His defence of him&s;elf, writ with &s;o much care when he was in the <HI>Tower,</HI> is a very mean performance. He intended in that to make an appeal to the world. In mo&s;t particulars he excu&s;es him&s;elf by this, that he was but one of many, who either in Council, Star-chamber, or High-Commi&s;&s;ion voted illegal things. Now tho' this was true, yet a chief Mini&s;ter, and one in high favour, determines the re&s;t &s;o much, that they are generally little better than machines acted by him. On other occca&s;ions he &s;ays, the thing was proved but by one witne&s;s. Now, how &s;trong &s;oever this defence may be in law, it is of no force in an appeal to the world; for if a thing is true, it is no matter how full or how defective the proof is. The thing that gave me the &s;trong|e&s;t prejudice again&s;t him in that book is, that after he had &s;een the ill effects of his violent coun&s;els, and had been &s;o long &s;hut up, and &s;o long at lei&s;ure to reflect on what had pa&s;s'd in the hur|ry of pa&s;&s;ion in the exaltation of his pro&s;perity, he does not in any one part of that great work acknowledge his own errours, nor mix in it any wi&s;e or pious reflections on the ill u&s;age he met with or the unhappy &s;teps he had made: So that while his enemies did really magnify him by their inhuman pro&s;ecuti|on, his friends <HI>Heylin</HI> and <HI>Wharton</HI> have as much le&s;&s;ened him, the one by writing his life, and the other by publi&s;hing his vin|dication of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But the recoiling of cruel coun&s;els on the authors of them <NOTE PLACE="marg">The account of <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE> never appeared more eminently than in the death of King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t, who&s;e &s;erious and chri&s;tian deportment in it made all his former errours be entirely forgot, and rai&s;ed a compa&s;&s;io|nate regard to him, that drew a la&s;ting hatred on the actors, and was the true occa&s;ion of the great turn of the nation in the year 1660. This was much heightened by the publi&s;hing of his book called <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, which was univer&s;ally believed to be his own: And that coming out &s;oon after his death had the great|e&s;t run in many impre&s;&s;ions that any book has had in our age. There was in it a noblene&s;s and ju&s;tne&s;s of thought with a great|ne&s;s
<PB N="51" REF="67">
of &s;tyle, that made it to be look'd on as the be&s;t writ book in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> language: And the piety of the prayers made all people cry out again&s;t the murder of a Prince, who thought &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly of all his affairs in his &s;ecret meditations before God. I was bred up with a high veneration of this book: And I re|member that, when I heard how &s;ome denied it to be his, I a&s;ked the Earl of <HI>Lothian</HI> about it, who both knew the King very well and loved him little: He &s;eemed confident it was his own work; for he &s;aid, he had heard him &s;ay a great many of tho&s;e very periods that he found in that book. Being thus con|firmed in that per&s;ua&s;ion, I was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed, when in the year 1673, in which I had a great &s;hare of favour and free conver&s;ation with the then Duke of <HI>York,</HI> afterwards King <HI>James</HI> the &s;econd, as he &s;uffered me to talk very freely to him about matters of religion, and as I was urging him with &s;omewhat out of his father's book, he told me that book was not of his father's writing, and that the letter to the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> was never brought to him. He &s;aid, Dr. <HI>Gawden</HI> writ it: After the re|&s;toration he brought the Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> both to the King and to him&s;elf, who affirmed that they knew it was his writing; and that it was carried down by the Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> and &s;hewed the King during the treaty of <HI>Newport,</HI> who read it, and approved of it as contain|ing his &s;en&s;e of things. Upon this he told me, that tho' <HI>Sheldon</HI> and the other Bi&s;hops oppo&s;ed <HI>Gawden</HI>'s promotion be|cau&s;e he had taken the Covenant, yet the merits of that &s;ervice carried it for him notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition made to it. There has been a great deal of di&s;puting about this book: Some are &s;o zealous for mantaining it to be the King's, that they think a man fal&s;e to the Church that doubts it to be his: Yet the evidence &s;ince that time brought to the contrary has been &s;o &s;trong, that I mu&s;t leave that under the &s;ame uncertainty un|der which I found it: Only this is certain, that <HI>Gawden</HI> never writ any thing with that force, his other writings being &s;uch, that no man from a likene&s;s of &s;tyle would think him capable of writing &s;o extraordinary a book as that is.</P>
<P>Upon the King's death the <HI>Scots</HI> proclaimed his &s;on King, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The $word$ treat with $span$ the $word$.</NOTE> and &s;ent over Sir <HI>George Wincam,</HI> that married my great aunt, to treat with him while he was in the i&s;le of <HI>Jer&s;ey.</HI> The King entred into a negotiation with them, and &s;ent him back with general a&s;&s;urances of con&s;enting to every rea&s;onable propo&s;ition that they &s;hould &s;end him.

<HI>Ca&s;&s;iles</HI> and <HI>Lothian,</HI> the former of the&s;e was my fir&s;t wife's fa|ther, a man of great vertue and of a con&s;iderable degree of good under&s;tanding: He was &s;o &s;incere, that he would &s;uffer no man to take his words in any other &s;en&s;e than as he meant them: He adhered firmly to his in&s;tructions, but with &s;o much candour, that King <HI>Charles</HI> retained very kind impre&s;&s;ions of it to his life's end. The man then in the greate&s;t favour with the King was the Duke of <HI>Buckingham:</HI> He was wholly turned to mirth and plea&s;ure: He had the art of turning per&s;ons or things into ridicule beyond any man of the age: He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the young King with very ill principles both as to religion and morality, and with a very mean opinion of his father, who&s;e &s;tiffne&s;s was with him a frequent &s;ubject of raillery. He prevailed with the King to enter into a treaty with the <HI>Scots,</HI> tho' that was vehe|mently oppo&s;ed by almo&s;t all the re&s;t that were about him, who pre&s;&s;ed him to adhere &s;teddily to his father's maxims and example.</P>

The Marquis of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> came likewi&s;e to him, and undertook if he would follow his coun&s;els to re&s;tore him to his Kingdoms by main force: But when the King de&s;ired the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to examine the methods which he propo&s;ed, he entertained him with a recital of his own performances and of the credit he was in among the people; and &s;aid, the whole nation would ri&s;e if he went over, tho' accompanied only with a page. He de&s;ired of the King nothing but power to act in his name, with a &s;upply in money, and a letter recommending him to the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> for a &s;hip to carry him over, and for &s;uch arms as he could &s;pare. With that the King gave him the Garter. He got fir&s;t to <HI>Orknay,</HI> and from thence into the Highlands of <HI>Scotland;</HI> but could perform nothing of what he had undertaken. At la&s;t he was betrayed by one of tho&s;e to whom he tru&s;ted him&s;elf, <HI>Markland</HI> of <HI>A&s;&s;in,</HI> and was brought over a pri&s;oner to <HI>Edenburgh.</HI> He was carried thro' the &s;treets with all the <NOTE PLACE="marg">And death.</NOTE> infamy that brutal men could contrive: And in a few days he was hanged on a very high gibbet: And his head and quarters were &s;et up in divers places of the Kingdom. His behaviour under all that barbarous u&s;age was as great and firm to the la&s;t, looking on all that was done to him with a noble &s;corn, as the fury of his enemies was black and univer&s;ally dete&s;ted. This cruelty rai&s;ed a horrour in all &s;ober people again&s;t tho&s;e who could in&s;ult over &s;uch a man in misfortunes. The triumphs that the
<PB N="53" REF="69">
preachers made on this occa&s;ion rendered them odious, and made Lord <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> to be both more pitied and lamented, than other|wi&s;e he could have been. This happened while the <HI>Scots</HI> com|mi&s;&s;ioners were treating with the King at the <HI>Hague.</HI> The vi|olent party in <HI>Scotland</HI> were for breaking off the treaty upon it, tho' by the date of Lord <HI>Montro&s;e</HI>'s commi&s;&s;ion it appeared to have been granted before the treaty was begun: But it was car|ried not to recall their commi&s;&s;ioners: Nor could the King on the other hand be prevailed on by his own Court to &s;end them away upon this cruelty to a man who had acted by his commi&s;|&s;ion, and yet was &s;o u&s;ed. The treaty was quickly concluded: The King was in no condition to &s;truggle with them, but yield|ed to all their demands, of taking the Covenant, and &s;uffering none to be about him but &s;uch as took it. He &s;ailed home to <HI>Scotland</HI> in &s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> men of war with which the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> furni&s;hed him, with all the &s;tock of money and arms that his credit could rai&s;e. That indeed would not have been very great, if the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had not joined his own to it. The Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> were &s;uffered to go home with him: But &s;oon after his landing an or|der came to put them from him. The King complained of this: But Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> at parting told him, he mu&s;t prepare for things of a harder dige&s;tion: He &s;aid, at pre&s;ent he could do him no &s;ervice: The Marquis of <HI>Argile</HI> was then in ab&s;olute credit: Therefore he de&s;ired that he would &s;tudy to gain him, and give him no cau&s;e of jealou&s;y on his account. This King <HI>Charles</HI> told me him&s;elf, as a part of Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s character. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> took all the ways po&s;&s;ible to gain Lord <HI>Argile</HI> and the Mini&s;ters: Only his di&s;&s;olute cour&s;e of life was exce&s;&s;ive &s;candalous; which to their great reproach they con|nived at, becau&s;e he advi&s;ed the King to put him&s;elf wholly in|to their hands. The King wrought him&s;elf into as grave a de|portment as he could: He heard many prayers and &s;ermons, &s;ome of a great length. I remember in one fa&s;t day there were &s;ix &s;ermons preached without intermi&s;&s;ion. I was there my &s;elf, and not a little weary of &s;o tedious a &s;ervice. The King was not allowed &s;o much as to walk abroad on &s;undays: And if at any time there had been any gaiety at Court, &s;uch as dancing or playing at cards, he was &s;everely reproved for it. This was managed with &s;o much rigour, and &s;o little di&s;cretion, that it contributed not a little to beget in him an aver&s;ion to all &s;ort of &s;trictne&s;s in religion. All that had acted on his father's &s;ide were ordered to keep at a great di&s;tance from him: And be|cau&s;e the common people &s;hewed &s;ome affection to the King, the
<PB N="54" REF="70">
crouds that pre&s;s'd to &s;ee him were al&s;o kept off from coming about him. <HI>Cromwell</HI> was not idle: But &s;eeing the <HI>Scots</HI> were calling home their King, and knowing that from thence he might expect an inva&s;ion into <HI>England,</HI> he re&s;olved to prevent them, and &s;o marched into <HI>Scotland</HI> with his army. The <HI>Scots</HI> brought together a very good army: The King was &s;uffered to come once to &s;ee it, but not to &s;tay in it; for they were afraid he might gain too much upon the &s;ouldiers: So he was &s;ent away.</P>
<P>The army was indeed one of the be&s;t that ever <HI>Scotland</HI> had <NOTE PLACE="marg">The defeat at <HI>Dunbar.</HI></NOTE> brought together: But it was ill commanded: For all that had made defection from their cau&s;e, or that were thought indiffe|rent as to either &s;ide, which they called dete&s;table neutrali|ty, were put out of commi&s;&s;ion. The preachers thought it an army of &s;aints, and &s;eemed well a&s;&s;ured of &s;ucce&s;s. They drew near <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who being pre&s;&s;ed by them retired towards <HI>Dun|bar,</HI> where his &s;hips and provi&s;ions lay. The <HI>Scots</HI> followed him, and were po&s;ted on a hill about a mile from thence, where there was no attacking them. <HI>Cromwell</HI> was then in great di&s;tre&s;s, and looked on him&s;elf as undone. There was no marching towards <HI>Berwick,</HI> the ground was too narrow: Nor could he come back into the country without being &s;eparated from his &s;hips, and &s;tarving his army. The lea&s;t evil &s;eemed to be to kill his hor&s;es, and put his army on board, and &s;ail back to <HI>Newca&s;tle;</HI> which, in the di&s;po&s;ition that <HI>England</HI> was in at that time, would have been all their de&s;truction, for it would have occa&s;ioned an univer&s;al in&s;urrection for the King. They had not above three days fo|rage for their hor&s;es. So <HI>Cromwell</HI> called his officers to a day of &s;eeking the Lord, in their &s;tyle. He loved to talk much of that matter all his life long afterwards: He &s;aid, he felt &s;uch an enlargement of heart in prayer, and &s;uch quiet upon it, that he bade all about him take heart, for God had certainly heard them, and would appear for them. After prayer they walked in the Earl of <HI>Roxburgh</HI>'s gardens that lay under the hill: And by pro&s;pec|tive gla&s;&s;es they di&s;cerned a great motion in the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Camp: Upon which <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;aid, God is delivering them into our hands, they are coming down to us. <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> was in the chief command: But he had a committee of the States to give him his orders, among whom <HI>Wari&s;toun</HI> was one. The&s;e were wea|ry of lying in the fields, and thought that <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> made not ha&s;te enough to de&s;troy tho&s;e Sectaries; for &s;o they came to call them. He told them, by lying there all was &s;ure; but that by engaging in action with gallant and de&s;perate men all might be lo&s;t: Yet they &s;till called on him to fall on. Many have thought that all this was treachery done on de&s;ign to deliver up our army to
<PB N="55" REF="71">
<HI>Cromwell;</HI> &s;ome laying it upon <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> and others upon my uncle. I am per&s;uaded there was no treachery in it: Only <HI>Wa|ri&s;toun</HI> was too hot, and <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> was too cold, and yielded too ea&s;ily to their humours, which he ought not to have done. They were all the night employed in coming down the hill: And in the morning, before they were put in order, <HI>Cromwell</HI> fell upon them. Two regiments &s;tood their ground, and were almo&s;t all killed in their ranks: The re&s;t did run in a mo&s;t &s;hame|ful manner: So that both their artillery and baggage were lo&s;t, and with the&s;e a great many pri&s;oners were taken, &s;ome thou|&s;ands in all. <HI>Cromwell</HI> upon this advanced to <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> where he was received without any oppo&s;ition: And the ca&s;tle that might have made a long re&s;i&s;tance did capitulate. So all the &s;outhern part of <HI>Scotland</HI> came under contribution to <HI>Cromwell. Sterlin</HI> was the advanced garri&s;on on the King's &s;ide. He him|&s;elf retired to St. <HI>John&s;toun.</HI> A Parliament was called that &s;at for &s;ome time at <HI>Sterlin,</HI> and for &s;ome time at St. <HI>John&s;toun,</HI> in which a full indemnity was pa&s;s'd, not in the language of a pardon but of an act of approbation: Only all that joined with <HI>Cromwell</HI> were declared traitors. But now the way of rai&s;ing a new army was to be thought on.</P>
<P>A que&s;tion had been propo&s;ed both to the committee of States <NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;putes a|bout the ad+mitting of all per&s;ons to &s;erve their country.</NOTE> and to the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Kirk, whether in this extremi|ty tho&s;e who had made defection, or had been hitherto too backward in the work, might not upon the profe&s;&s;ion of their repentance be received into publick tru&s;t, and admitted to &s;erve in the defence of their country. To this an&s;wers were di&s;tinctly given by two re&s;olutions: The one was, that they ought to be admitted to make profe&s;&s;ion of their repentance: And the other was&punc; that after &s;uch profe&s;&s;ions made they might be received to defend and &s;erve their country.</P>
<P>Upon this a great divi&s;ion followed in the Kirk: Tho&s;e who adhered to the&s;e re&s;olutions were called the Publick Re&s;olutio|ners: But again&s;t the&s;e &s;ome of tho&s;e bodies prote&s;ted, and they, together with tho&s;e who adhered to them, were called the Pro|te&s;tors. On the one hand it was &s;aid, that every government might call out all that were under its protection to its defence: This &s;eemed founded on the law of nature and of nations: And, if men had been mi&s;led, it was a &s;trange cruelty to deny room for repentance: This was contrary to the nature of God and to the Go&s;pel, and was a likely mean to drive them to de&s;pair: Therefore after two years time it &s;eemed rea&s;onable to allow them to &s;erve according to their birthright in Parliament, or in other hereditary offices, or in the army; from all which they had
<PB N="56" REF="72">
been excluded by an act made in the year 1649, which ranged them in different cla&s;&s;es, and was from thence called the act of cla&s;&s;es. But the Prote&s;tors objected again&s;t all this, that to take in men of known enmity to the cau&s;e was a &s;ort of betray|ing it, becau&s;e it was the putting it in their power to betray it; that to admit them into a profe&s;&s;ion of repentance was a pro|fanation, and a mocking of God: It was vi&s;ible, they were wil|ling to comply with the&s;e terms, tho' again&s;t their con&s;cience, only to get into the army: Nor could they expect a ble&s;&s;ing from God on an army &s;o con&s;tituted. And as to this particu|lar they had great advantage; for this mock penitence was in|deed a matter of great &s;candal. When the&s;e re&s;olutions were pa&s;s'd with this prote&s;tation, a great many of the five we&s;tern counties, <HI>Cliddi&s;dale, Renfrew, Air, Galloway</HI> and <HI>Nithi&s;dale,</HI> met, and formed an a&s;&s;ociation apart, both again&s;t the army of Sectaries, and again&s;t this new defection in the Kirk party. They drew a remon&s;trance again&s;t all the proceedings in the treaty with the King, when, as they &s;aid, it was vi&s;ible by the commi&s;&s;ion he granted to <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> that his heart was not &s;incere: And they were al&s;o again&s;t the tendring him the Covenant, when they had rea&s;on to believe he took it not with a re&s;olution to maintain it, &s;ince his whole deportment and private conver&s;a|tion &s;hewed a &s;ecret enmity to the work of God: And, after an inviduous enumeration of many particulars, they imputed the &s;hameful defeat at <HI>Dunbar</HI> to their prevaricating in the&s;e things; and concluded with a de&s;ire, that the King might be excluded from any &s;hare in the admini&s;tration of the Government, and that his cau&s;e might be put out of the &s;tate of the quarrel with the army of the Sectaries. This was brought to the committee of the States at St. <HI>John&s;toun,</HI> and was &s;everely inveighed again&s;t by Sir <HI>Thomas Nichol&s;on,</HI> the King's advocate or attorney general there, who had been till then a zealous man of their party: But he had lately married my &s;i&s;ter, and my father had great in|fluence on him. He prevailed &s;o, that the remon&s;trance was con|demned as divi&s;ive, factious, and &s;candalous: But that the peo|ple might not be too much moved with the&s;e things, a declara|tion <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great hard|$span$ put on $$$ King.</NOTE> was prepared to be &s;et out by the King for the &s;atisfying of them. In it there were many hard things. The King own|ed the &s;in of his father in marrying into an idolatrous family: He acknowledged the blood&s;hed in the late wars lay at his fa|ther's door: He expre&s;&s;ed a deep &s;en&s;e of his own ill education, and the prejudices he had drunk in again&s;t the cau&s;e of God, of which he was now very &s;en&s;ible: He confe&s;&s;ed all the former parts of his life to have been a cour&s;e of enmity to the work of
<PB N="57" REF="73">
God: He repented of his commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> and of eve|ry thing he had done that gave offence: And with &s;olemn pro|te&s;tations he affirmed, that he was now &s;incere in his declaration, and that he would adhere to it to the end of his life in <HI>Scot|land, England,</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>The King was very unea&s;y when this was brought to him. He &s;aid, he could never look his mother in the face if he pa&s;s'd it. But when he was told it was nece&s;&s;ary for his affairs, he re&s;olved to &s;wallow the pill without farther chewing it. So it was publi&s;hed, but had no good effect; for neither &s;ide belie|ved him &s;incere in it. It was thought a &s;trange impo&s;ition, to make him load his father's memory in &s;uch a manner. But, while the King was thus be&s;et with the high and more mode|rate Kirk parties, the old Cavaliers &s;ent to him, offering that if he would ca&s;t him&s;elf into their hands they would meet him near <HI>Dundee</HI> with a great body. Upon this the King, growing weary of the &s;ad life he led, made his e&s;cape in the night, and came to the place appointed: But it was a vain undertaking; for he was met by a very incon&s;iderable body at <HI>Clova,</HI> the place of rendezvous. Tho&s;e at St. <HI>John&s;toun</HI> being troubled at this &s;ent Col. <HI>Montgomery</HI> after him, who came up and pre&s;s'd him to return very rudely: So the King came back. But this had a very good effect. The government &s;aw now the danger of u&s;ing him ill, which might provoke him to de&s;perate cour&s;es: After that, he was u&s;ed as well as that Kingdom in &s;o ill a &s;tate was capable of. He &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of courting the Marquis of <HI>Argile,</HI> and therefore made him great offers: At la&s;t he talked of marrying his daughter. Lord <HI>Argile</HI> was cold and backward: He &s;aw the King's heart lay not to him: So he look|ed on all offers, but as &s;o many &s;nares. His &s;on, the Lord <HI>Lorn,</HI> was captain of the guards: And he made his court more dex|trou&s;ly; for he brought all per&s;ons that the King had a mind to &s;peak with at all hours to him, and was in all re&s;pects not only faithful but zealous. Yet this was &s;u&s;pected as a collu&s;ion between the father and the &s;on. The King was crowned on the fir&s;t of <HI>January:</HI> And there he again renewed the Covenant: And now all people were admitted to come to him, and to &s;erve in the army. The two armies lay peaceably in their winter quar|ters. But when the &s;ummer came on, a body of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pa&s;s'd the <HI>Frith,</HI> and landed in <HI>Fife.</HI> So the King, having got up all the forces he had expected, re&s;olved on a march into <HI>Eng|land. Scotland</HI> could not maintain another year's war. This was a de&s;perate re&s;olution: But there was nothing el&s;e to be done.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="74">
I will not pur&s;ue the relation of the march to <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> nor the total defeat given the King's army on the third of <HI>Sep|tember,</HI> the &s;ame day in which <HI>Dunbar</HI> fight had been fought the year before. The&s;e things are &s;o well known, as is al&s;o the King's e&s;cape, that I can add nothing to the common re|lations that have been over and over made of them. At the &s;ame time that <HI>Cromwell</HI> followed the King into <HI>England,</HI> he left <HI>Monk</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> with an army &s;ufficient to reduce the re&s;t of the Kingdom. The town of <HI>Dundee</HI> made a ra&s;h and ill con|&s;idered re&s;i&s;tance: It was after a few days &s;iege taken by &s;torm: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Scotland</HI> was &s;ubdued by <HI>Monk.</HI></NOTE> Much blood was &s;hed, and the town was &s;everely plundered: No other place made any re&s;i&s;tance. I remember well of three regiments coming to <HI>Aberdeen.</HI> There was an order and di&s;ci|pline, and a face of gravity and piety among them, that ama|zed all people. Mo&s;t of them were Independents and Anabap|ti&s;ts: They were all gifted men, and preached as they were mo|ved. But they never di&s;turbed the publick a&s;&s;emblies in the chur|ches but once. They came and reproached the preachers for laying things to their charge that were fal&s;e. I was then pre|&s;ent: The debate grew very fierce: At la&s;t they drew their &s;words: But there was no hurt done: Yet <HI>Cromwell</HI> di&s;placed the governour for not puni&s;hing this.</P>
<P>When the low-countries in <HI>Scotland</HI> were thus reduced, &s;ome <NOTE PLACE="marg">A body &s;tood out in the Highlands.</NOTE> of the more zealous of the nobility went to the Highlands in the year 1653. The Earl of <HI>Gleneairn,</HI> a grave and &s;ober man, got the tribe of the <HI>Macdonalds</HI> to declare for the King. To the&s;e the Lord <HI>Lorn</HI> came with about a thou&s;and men: But the jealou&s;y of the father made the &s;on be &s;u&s;pected. The Marquis of <HI>Argile</HI> had retired into his country when the King marched into <HI>England;</HI> and did not &s;ubmit to <HI>Monk</HI> till the year 52. Then he received a garri&s;on: But Lord <HI>Lorn</HI> &s;urpri&s;ed a &s;hip that was &s;ent about with provi&s;ions to it, which helped to &s;upport their little ill-formed army. Many gentlemen came to them: And almo&s;t all the good hor&s;es of the Kingdom were &s;tollen, and carried up to them. They made a body of about 3000: Of the&s;e they had about 500 hor&s;e. They endured great hard|&s;hips; for tho&s;e parts were not fit to entertain men that had been accu&s;tomed to live &s;oftly. The Earl of <HI>Glencairn</HI> had al|mo&s;t &s;poiled all: For he took much upon him: And upon &s;ome &s;u&s;picion he ordered Lord <HI>Lorn</HI> to be clapt up, who had notice of it, and prevented it by an e&s;cape: Otherwi&s;e they had fallen to cut one another's throats, in&s;tead of marching to the enemy. The Earl of <HI>Belcarras,</HI> a vertuous and knowing man but &s;ome|what moro&s;e in his humour, went al&s;o among them. They dif|fered
<PB N="59" REF="75">
in their coun&s;els: Lord <HI>Glencairn</HI> was for falling into the low-countries: And he began to fancy he &s;hould be another <HI>Mon|tro&s;e. Belcarras</HI> on the other hand was for keeping in their fa&s;t|ne&s;&s;es: They made a &s;hew of a body for the King, which they were to keep up in &s;ome reputation as long as they could, till they could &s;ee what a&s;&s;i&s;tance the King might be able to pro|cure them from beyond &s;ea of men money and arms; whereas if they went out of tho&s;e fa&s;t grounds, they could not hope to &s;tand before &s;uch a veteran and well di&s;ciplined army as <HI>Monk</HI> had; and if they met with the lea&s;t check, their tumultuary body would &s;oon melt away.</P>
<P>Among others one Sir <HI>Robert Murray,</HI> that had married Lord <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Robert Murray</HI>'s character.</NOTE> <HI>Belcarras</HI>'s &s;i&s;ter, came among them: He had &s;erved in <HI>France,</HI> where he had got into &s;uch a degree of favour with <HI>Cardinal Richlieu,</HI> that few &s;trangers were ever &s;o much con&s;idered by him as he was. He was rai&s;ed to be a Collonel there, and came over for recruits when the King was with the <HI>Scotch</HI> army at <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI> There he grew into high favour with the King; and laid a de&s;ign for his e&s;cape, of which I have given an account in Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s memoirs: He was the mo&s;t uni|ver&s;ally beloved and e&s;teemed by men of all &s;ides and &s;orts, of any man I have ever known in my whole Life. He was a pious man, and in the mid&s;t of armies and courts he &s;pent many hours a day in devotion. He had gone thro' the ea&s;y parts of mathe|maticks, and knew the hi&s;tory of nature beyond any man I ever yet knew. He had a genius much like <HI>Peiri&s;ki,</HI> as he is de|&s;cribed by <HI>Ga&s;&s;endi.</HI> He was afterwards the fir&s;t former of the Royal &s;ociety, and its fir&s;t pre&s;ident; and while he lived he was the life and &s;oul of that body. He had an equality of temper in him that nothing could alter; and was in practice the only Stoick I ever knew. He had a great tincture of one of their prin|ciples; for he was much for ab&s;olute decrees. He had a mo&s;t diffu&s;ed love to all mankind, and he delighted in every occa|&s;ion of doing good, which he managed with great di&s;cretion and zeal. He had a &s;uperiority of genius and comprehen&s;ion to mo&s;t men: And had the plaine&s;t, but with all the &s;ofte&s;t, way of reproving, chiefly young people, for their faults that I ever met with. Sir <HI>Robert Murray</HI> was in &s;uch credit in that little army, that Lord <HI>Glencairn</HI> took a &s;trange cour&s;e to break it, and to ruin him. A letter was pretended to be found at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> as writ by him to <HI>William Murray</HI> of the bed-chamber, that had been whipping boy to King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t, and upon that had grown up to a degree of favour and confidence that was very particular: He had a leud creature there, whom he turned off:
<PB N="60" REF="76">
And &s;he to be revenged on him framed this plot again&s;t him. This ill forged letter gave an account of a bargain Sir <HI>Robert</HI> had made with <HI>Monk</HI> for killing the King, which was to be executed by Mr. <HI>Murray:</HI> So he prayed him in his letter to make ha&s;te and di&s;patch it. This was brought to the Earl of <HI>Glencairn:</HI> So Sir <HI>Robert</HI> was &s;everely que&s;tioned upon it, and put in arre&s;t: And it was &s;pread about thro' a rude army that he intended to kill the King, hoping it &s;eems that &s;ome of the&s;e wild people belie|ving it would have fallen upon him without u&s;ing any forms. Upon this occa&s;ion Sir <HI>Robert</HI> practi&s;ed in a very eminent man|ner his true chri&s;tian philo&s;ophy, without &s;hewing &s;o much as a cloud in his whole behaviour.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Belcarras</HI> left the Highlands, and went to the King; and &s;hewed him the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending a military man to command that body, to whom they would &s;ubmit more wil|lingly than to any of the Nobility. <HI>Midletoun</HI> was &s;ent over, who was a gallant man and a good officer: He had fir&s;t &s;erved on the Parliament's &s;ide: But he turned over to the King, and was taken at <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> fight, but made his e&s;cape out of the Tower. He upon his coming over did for &s;ome time lay the heats that were among the Highlanders; and made as much of that face of an army for another year as was po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><HI>Drumond</HI> was &s;ent by him to <HI>Paris</HI> with an invitation to the King to come among them; for they had a&s;&s;urances &s;ent them, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Me&s;&s;ages &s;ent to the King.</NOTE> that the whole Nation was in a di&s;po&s;ition to ri&s;e with them: And <HI>England</HI> was beginning to grow weary of their new govern|ment, the Army and the Parliament being on ill terms. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were al&s;o engaged in a war with the States: And the <HI>Dutch</HI> upon that account might be inclined to a&s;&s;i&s;t the King to give a diver&s;ion to their enemies forces. <HI>Drumond</HI> told me, that upon his coming to <HI>Paris</HI> he was called to the little Council that was then about the King: And when he had delivered his me&s;|&s;age, Chancellour <HI>Hide</HI> a&s;ked him, how the King would be ac|commodated if he came among them: He an&s;wered, not &s;o well as was fitting, but they would all take care of him to fur|ni&s;h him with every thing that was nece&s;&s;ary. He wondered that the King did not check the Chancellour in his demand; for he &s;aid, it looked &s;trange to him, that when they were hazarding their lives to help him to a crown, he &s;hould be con|cerned for accommodation. He was &s;ent back with good words and a few kind letters. In the end of the year 1654 <HI>Mor|gan</HI> marched into the Highlands, and had a &s;mall engagement with <HI>Midletoun,</HI> which broke that whole matter, of which all people were grown weary; for they had no pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s,
<PB N="61" REF="77">
and the low countries were &s;o over-run with robberies on the pretence of going to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Highlanders, that there was an univer&s;al joy at the di&s;per&s;ing of that little unruly army.</P>
<P>After this the country was kept in great order: Some ca&s;tles <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;tate of <HI>Scotland</HI> du|ring the u&s;urpation.</NOTE> in the Highlands had garri&s;ons put in them, that were &s;o careful in their di&s;cipline, and &s;o exact to their rules, that in no time the Highlands were kept in better order than during the u&s;ur|pation. There was a con&s;iderable force of about 7 or 8000 men kept in <HI>Scotland:</HI> The&s;e were paid exactly, and &s;trictly di&s;|ciplined. The pay of the army brought &s;o much money into the Kingdom, that it continued all that while in a very flouri&s;hing &s;tate. <HI>Cromwell</HI> built three citadels, at <HI>Leith, Air,</HI> and <HI>Inver|ne&s;s,</HI> be&s;ides many little forts. There was good ju&s;tice done, and vice was &s;uppre&s;s'd and puni&s;hed; &s;o that we always reckon tho&s;e eight years of u&s;urpation a time of great peace and pro&s;|perity. There was al&s;o a &s;ort of union of the three Kingdoms in one Parliament, where <HI>Scotland</HI> had its repre&s;entative. The Mar|quis of <HI>Argile</HI> went up one of our commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>The next &s;cene I mu&s;t open relates to the church, and the <NOTE PLACE="marg">D$span$ m$span$ Cov$span$ ters.</NOTE> heats rai&s;ed in it by the publick re&s;olutions, and the prote&s;ta|tion made again&s;t them. New occa&s;ions of di&s;pute aro&s;e. A Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly was in cour&s;e to meet; and &s;ate at St. <HI>Andrews:</HI> So the commi&s;&s;ion of the Kirk wrote a circular letter to all the Pre&s;byteries, &s;etting forth all the grounds of their re&s;olutions, and complaining of tho&s;e who had prote&s;ted again&s;t them; up|on which they de&s;ired that they would chu&s;e none of tho&s;e who adhered to the prote&s;tation to repre&s;ent them in the next a&s;&s;em|bly. This was only an advice, and had been frequently practi|&s;ed in the former years: But now it was highly complained of, as a limitation on the freedom of elections, which inferred a nul|lity on all their proceedings: So the Prote&s;tors renewed their prote&s;tation again&s;t the meeting upon a higher point, di&s;own|ing that authority which hitherto they had magnified as the highe&s;t tribunal in the church, in which they thought Chri&s;t was in his throne. Upon this a great debate followed, and ma|ny books were written in a cour&s;e of &s;everal years. The Publick men &s;aid, this was the de&s;troying of Pre&s;bytery, if the le&s;&s;er number did not &s;ubmit to the greater: It was a &s;ort of Prela|cy, if it was pretended that votes ought rather to be weighed than counted: Parity was the e&s;&s;ence of their con&s;titution: And in this all people &s;aw they had clearly the better of the argu|ment. The Prote&s;tors urged for them&s;elves, that, &s;ince all Pro|te&s;tants rejected the pretence of infallibility, the major part of the church might fall into errours, in which ca&s;e the le&s;&s;er num|ber
<PB N="62" REF="78">
could not be bound to &s;ubmit to them: They complained of the many corrupt Clergy-men who were yet among them, who were leavened with the old leaven, and did on all occa&s;i|ons &s;hew what was &s;till at heart notwith&s;tanding all their out|ward compliance: (For the epi&s;copal Clergy, that had gone into the Covenant and Pre&s;bytery to hold their livings, &s;truck in with great heat to inflame the controver&s;y: And it appeared very vi&s;ibly that Pre&s;bytery, if not held in order by the civil power, could not be long kept in quiet:) If in the &s;upream Court of judicature the majority did not conclude the matter, it was not po&s;&s;ible to keep up their beloved parity: It was con|fe&s;&s;ed that in doctrinal points the le&s;&s;er number was not bound to &s;ubmit to the greater: But in the matters of mere government it was impo&s;&s;ible to maintain the Pre&s;byterian form on any other bottom.</P>
<P>As this debate grew hot, and they were ready to break out into cen&s;ures on both &s;ides, &s;ome were &s;ent down from the Com|monwealth of <HI>England</HI> to &s;ettle <HI>Scotland:</HI> Of the&s;e Sir <HI>Henry Vane</HI> was one. The Re&s;olutioners were known to have been more in the King's intere&s;t: So they were not &s;o kindly looked on as the Prote&s;tors. Some of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> juncto moved, that pains &s;hould be taken to unite the two parties. But <HI>Vane</HI> oppo|&s;ed this with much zeal: He &s;aid, would they heal the wound that they had given them&s;elves, which weakened them &s;o much? The &s;etting them at quiet could have no other effect, but to heal and unite them in their oppo&s;ition to their authority: He therefore moved, that they might be left at liberty to fight out their own quarrels, and be kept in a greater dependence on the temporal authority, when both &s;ides were forced to make their appeal to it: So it was re&s;olved to &s;uffer them to meet &s;till in their Pre&s;byteries and Synods, but not in General A&s;&s;emblies, which had a greater face of union and authority.</P>
<P>This advice was followed: So the divi&s;ion went on. Both &s;ides &s;tudied when any church became vacant to get a man of their own party to be cho&s;en to &s;ucceed in the election: And upon the&s;e occa&s;ions many tumults happened: In &s;ome of them &s;tones were thrown, and many were wounded, to the great &s;candal of religion. In all the&s;e di&s;putes the Prote&s;tors were the fiercer &s;ide: For being le&s;s in number they &s;tudied to make that up with their fury. In one point they had the other at a great advantage, with relation to their new ma&s;ters who required them to give over praying for the King. The Prote&s;tors were weary of doing it, and &s;ubmitted very readily: But the others &s;tood out longer; and &s;aid, it was a duty lying on them by the
<PB N="63" REF="79" MS="Y">
Covenant, &s;o they could not let it fall. Upon that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Council &s;et out an order, that &s;uch as &s;hould continue to pray for the King &s;hould be denied the help of law to recover their tithes, or as they called them their &s;tipends. This touched them in a &s;en&s;ible point: But, that they might not &s;eem to act upon the civil authority, they did enact it in their Pre&s;byteries, that &s;ince all duties did not oblige at all times, therefore con&s;i|dering the pre&s;ent juncture, in which the King could not pro|tect them, they re&s;olved to di&s;continue that piece of duty. This expo&s;ed them to much cen&s;ure, &s;ince &s;uch a carnal con&s;ideration as the force of law for their benefices, (which all regard but too much tho' few will own it,) &s;eemed to be that which de|termined them.</P>
<P>This great breach among them being rather encouraged than <NOTE PLACE="marg">Methods ta|ken on both &s;ides.</NOTE> &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e who were in power, all the methods ima|ginable were u&s;ed by the Prote&s;tors to rai&s;e their credit among the people. They preached often, and very long; and &s;eem|ed to carry their devotions to a greater &s;ublimity than others did. Their con&s;tant topick was, the &s;ad defection and corrup|tion of the judicatories of the church, and they often propo|&s;ed &s;everal expedients for purging it. The truth was they were more active, and their performances were livelier, than the Pub|lick men. They were in nothing more &s;ingular than in their communions. In many places the &s;acrament was di&s;continued for &s;everal years; where they thought the magi&s;tracy, or the more eminent of the pari&s;h, were engaged in what they called the defection, which was much more looked at than &s;candal given by bad lives. But where the greate&s;t part was more &s;ound, they gave the &s;acrament with a new and unu&s;ual &s;olemnity. On the <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> before they held a fa&s;t day with prayers and &s;ermons for about eight or ten hours together: On the <HI>Satur|day</HI> they had two or three preparation &s;ermons: And on the Lord's day they had &s;o very many, that the action continued above twelve hours in &s;ome places: And all ended with three or four &s;ermons on <HI>Monday</HI> for thank&s;giving. A great many Mi|ni&s;ters were brought together from &s;everal parts: And high pre|tenders would have gone 40 or 50 miles to a noted communion. The crouds were far beyond the capacity of their churches, or the reach of their voices: So at the &s;ame time they had &s;er|mons in two or three different places: And all was performed with great &s;hew of zeal. They had &s;tories of many &s;equal con|ver&s;ions that were wrought on the&s;e occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>It is &s;carce credible what an effect this had among the peo|ple, to how great a mea&s;ure of knowledge they were brought,
<PB N="64" REF="80">
and how readily they could pray <HI>extempore,</HI> and talk of divine matters. All this tended to rai&s;e the credit of the Prote&s;tors. The Re&s;olutioners tried to imitate them in the&s;e practices: But they were not thought &s;o &s;piritual, nor &s;o ready at them: So the others had the chief following. Where the judicatories of the church were near an equality of the men of both &s;ides, there were perpetual janglings among them: At la&s;t they pro|ceeded to deprive men of both &s;ides, as they were the majo|rity in the judicatories: But becau&s;e the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the church, and the benefice, was to depend on the orders of the temporal Courts, both &s;ides made their application to the privy Council that <HI>Cromwell</HI> had &s;et up in <HI>Scotland:</HI> And they were by them referred to <HI>Cromwell</HI> him&s;elf. So they &s;ent deputies up to <HI>Lon|don.</HI> The Prote&s;tors went in great numbers: They came near|er both to the principles, and to the temper that prevailed in the Army: So they were looked on as the better men, on whom, by rea&s;on of the fir&s;t ri&s;e of the difference, the government might more certainly depend: Whereas the others were con&s;idered as more in the King's intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Re&s;olutioners &s;ent up one <HI>Sharp,</HI> who had been long in <HI>England,</HI> and was an active and eager man: He had a very &s;mall proportion of learning, and was but an indifferent prea|cher: But having &s;ome acquaintance with the Pre&s;byterian Mi|ni&s;ters at <HI>London,</HI> whom <HI>Cromwell</HI> was then courting much by rea&s;on of their credit in the City, he was by an errour that pro|ved fatal to the whole party &s;ent up in their name to <HI>London;</HI> where he continued for &s;ome years &s;oliciting their concerns, and making him&s;elf known to all &s;orts of people. He &s;eemed more than ordinary zealous for Pre&s;bytery. And, as <HI>Cromwell</HI> was then de&s;igning to make him&s;elf King, Dr. <HI>Wilkins</HI> told me he often &s;aid to him, no temporal government could have a &s;ure &s;upport without a national church that adhered to it, and he thought <HI>England</HI> was capable of no con&s;titution but epi&s;copacy, to which, he told me, he did not doubt but <HI>Cromwell</HI> would have turned, as &s;oon as the de&s;ign of his King&s;hip was &s;ettled. Upon this <HI>Wilkins</HI> &s;poke to <HI>Sharp,</HI> that it was plain by their breach that Pre&s;bytery could not be managed &s;o as to maintain order among them, and that an epi&s;copacy mu&s;t be brought in to &s;ettle them: But <HI>Sharp</HI> could not bear the di&s;cour&s;e, and rejected it with hor|ror. I have dwelt longer on this matter, and opened it more fully than was nece&s;&s;ary, if I had not thought that this may have a good effect on the reader, and &s;hew him how impo&s;&s;ible it is in a paritv to maintain peace and order, if the magi&s;trate
<PB N="65" REF="81">
does not interpo&s;e: And if he does that will be cried out upon by the zealots of both &s;ides, as abominable Era&s;tiani&s;m.</P>
<P>From the&s;e matters I go next to &s;et down &s;ome particulars <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some of <HI>Cromwell's</HI> maxims.</NOTE> that I knew concerning <HI>Cromwell,</HI> that I have not yet &s;een in books. Some of the&s;e I had from the Earls of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> and <HI>Orre|ry:</HI> The one had been the captain of his guards: And the other had been the pre&s;ident of his council in <HI>Scotland.</HI> But he from whom I learned the mo&s;t was <HI>Stouppe,</HI> a <HI>Gri&s;on</HI> by birth, then Mini&s;ter of the <HI>French</HI> Church in the <HI>Savoy,</HI> and afterwards a brigadeer general in the <HI>French</HI> armies: A man of intrigue, but of no vertue: He adhered to the Prote&s;tant religion as to out|ward appearance: He was much tru&s;ted by <HI>Cromwell</HI> in foreign affairs; in which <HI>Cromwell</HI> was oft at a lo&s;s, and having no fo|reign language, but the little latin that &s;tuck to him from his education, which he &s;poke very vitiou&s;ly and &s;cantily, had not the nece&s;&s;ary means of informing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When <HI>Cromwell</HI> fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed the government, he had three great parties of the Nation all again&s;t him, the Epi&s;copal, the Pre&s;byterian, and the Republican party. The la&s;t was the mo&s;t &s;et on his ruin, looking on him as the per&s;on that had perfi|diou&s;ly broke the Hou&s;e of Commons, and was &s;etting up for him&s;elf. He had none to rely on but the Army: Yet that en|thu&s;ia&s;tick temper, that he had taken &s;o much pains to rai&s;e among them, made them very intractable: Many of the chief officers were broken, and impri&s;oned by him: And he flattered the re&s;t the be&s;t he could. He went on in his old way of long and dark di&s;cour&s;es, &s;ermons, and prayers. As to the Cavalier party, he was affraid both of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination and other plottings from them. As to the former of the&s;e he took a method that proved very effectual: He &s;aid often and openly, that in a war it was nece&s;&s;ary to return upon any &s;ide all the violent things that any of the one &s;ide did to the other: This was done for pre|venting greater mi&s;chief, and for bringing men to fair war: Therefore, he &s;aid, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations were &s;uch dete&s;table things that he would never begin them: But if any of the King's party &s;hould endeavour to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him, and fail in it, he would make an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating war of it, and de&s;troy the whole family: And he pretended he had in&s;truments to execute it, when&s;oever he &s;hould give order for it. The terrour of this was a better &s;ecu|rity to him than his guards.</P>
<P>The other as to their plottings was the more dangerous. But he under&s;tood that one Sir <HI>Richard Willis</HI> was Chancellour <HI>Hide</HI>'s chief confident, to whom he wrote often, and to whom all the party &s;ubmitted, looking on him as an able and wi&s;e man in
<PB N="66" REF="82">
whom they confided ab&s;olutely. So he found a way to talk with him: He &s;aid, he did not intend to hurt any of the party: His de&s;ign was rather to &s;ave them from ruin: They were apt after their cups to run into fooli&s;h and ill concerted plots, which &s;ignified nothing but to ruin tho&s;e who engaged in them: He knew they con&s;ulted him in every thing: All he de&s;ired of him was to know all their plots, that he might &s;o di&s;concert them that none might ever &s;uffer for them: If he clapt any of them up in pri&s;on, it &s;hould only be for a little time: And they &s;hould be interrogated only about &s;ome trifling di&s;cour&s;e, but never about the bu&s;ine&s;s they had been engaged in. He offered <HI>Willis</HI> whatever he would accept of, and to give it when or as he plea&s;ed. He dur&s;t not a&s;k or take above 200 pound a year. None was tru&s;ted with this but his &s;ecretary <HI>Thurlo,</HI> who was a very dexterous man at getting intelligence.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Cromwell</HI> had all the King's party in a net. He let them dance in it at plea&s;ure: And upon occa&s;ions clapt them up for a &s;hort while: But nothing was ever di&s;covered that hurt any of them. In conclu&s;ion, after <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s death, <HI>Willis</HI> con|tinued to give notice of every thing to <HI>Thurlo.</HI> At la&s;t, when the plot was laid among the Cavaliers for a general in&s;urrection, the King was de&s;ired to come over to that which was to be rai|&s;ed in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex:</HI> He was to have landed near <HI>Chiche&s;ter,</HI> all by <HI>Wil|lis</HI>'s management: And a &s;nare was laid for him, in which he would probably have been caught, if <HI>Morland, Thurlo</HI>'s under &s;ecretary, who was a prying man, had not di&s;covered the corre&s;|pondence between his Ma&s;ter and <HI>Willis,</HI> and warned the King of his danger. Yet it was not ea&s;y to per&s;uade tho&s;e who had tru&s;ted <HI>Willis</HI> &s;o much, and who thought him faithful in all re&s;|pects, to believe that he could be guilty of &s;o black a treache|ry: So <HI>Morland</HI>'s adverti&s;ement was look'd on as an artifice to create jealou&s;y. But he to give a full conviction ob&s;erved where the &s;ecretary laid &s;ome letters of advice, on which he &s;aw he relied mo&s;t, and getting the key of that cabinet in his hand to &s;eal a letter with a &s;eal that hung to it, he took the impre&s;|&s;ion of it in wax, and got a key to be made from it, by which he opened the cabinet, and &s;ent over &s;ome of the mo&s;t important of tho&s;e letters. The hand was known, and this artful but black treachery was di&s;covered: So the de&s;ign of the ri&s;ing was laid a&s;ide. Sir <HI>George Booth</HI> having engaged at the &s;ame time to rai&s;e a body in <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> two &s;everal me&s;&s;engers were &s;ent to him to let him know the de&s;ign could not be executed at the time ap|pointed: But both the&s;e per&s;ons were &s;u&s;pected by &s;ome garri|&s;ons thro' which they mu&s;t pa&s;s, as giving no good account of
<PB N="67" REF="83">
them&s;elves in a time of jealou&s;y, and were &s;o long &s;topt, that they could not give him notice in time: So he very gallant|ly performed his part: But not being &s;econded he was &s;oon cru&s;hed by <HI>Lambert.</HI> Thus <HI>Willis</HI> lo&s;t the merit of great and long &s;ervices. This was one of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s ma&s;ter pieces.</P>
<P>As for the Pre&s;byterians, they were &s;o apprehen&s;ive of the fury of the Commonwealth party, that they thought it a delive|rance to be re&s;cued out of their hands: Many of the Republicans begun to profe&s;s Dei&s;m: And almo&s;t all of them were for de&s;|troying all Clergy-men, and for breaking every thing that look|ed like the union of a national church. They were for pulling down the churches, for di&s;charging the tithes, and for leaving religion free, as they called it, without either encouragement or re&s;traint. <HI>Cromwell</HI> a&s;&s;ured the Pre&s;byterians, he would main|tain a publick mini&s;try with all due encouragement; and he join|ed them in a commi&s;&s;ion with &s;ome Independents, to be the tri|ers of all tho&s;e who were to be admitted to benefices. The&s;e di&s;po&s;ed al&s;o of all the churches that were in the gift of the Crown, of the Bi&s;hops, and of the Cathedral Churches: So this &s;oftened them.</P>
<P>He &s;tudied to divide the Commonwealth party among them|&s;elves, and to &s;et the Fifth-monarchy men and the Enthu&s;ia&s;ts again&s;t tho&s;e who pretended to little or no religion, and acted only upon the principles of civil liberty; &s;uch as <HI>Algernoon Sid|ney, Henry Nevill, Martin, Wildman,</HI> and <HI>Harrington.</HI> The Fifth-monarchy men &s;eemed to be really on expectation every day when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould appear: <HI>John Goodwin</HI> headed the&s;e, who fir&s;t brought in <HI>Arminiani&s;m</HI> among the &s;ectaries, for he was for liberty of all &s;orts. <HI>Cromwell</HI> hated that doctrine: For his beloved notion was, that once a child of God was always a child of God: Now he had led a very &s;trict life for above eight years together before the war: So he comforted him&s;elf much with his reflections on that time, and on the certainty of per&s;everance. But none of the preachers were &s;o thorough paced for him as to temporal matters, as <HI>Goodwin</HI> was; for he not only ju&s;tified the putting the King to death, but magnified it as the gloriou&s;e&s;t action men were capable of. He filled all people with &s;uch ex|pectation of a glorious thou&s;and years &s;peedily to begin, that it looked like a madne&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them.</P>
<P>It was no ea&s;y thing for <HI>Cromwell</HI> to &s;atisfy tho&s;e, when he <NOTE PLACE="marg">His de&s;ign for the King&s;hip.</NOTE> took the power into his own hands; &s;ince that looked like a &s;tep to King&s;hip, which <HI>Goodwin</HI> had long repre&s;ented as the great Antichri&s;t, that hindered Chri&s;t's being &s;et on his throne. To the&s;e he &s;aid, and as &s;ome have told me, with many tears, that
<PB N="68" REF="84">
he would rather have taken a &s;hepherd's &s;taff than the Protector|&s;hip, &s;ince nothing was more contrary to his genius than a &s;hew of greatne&s;s: But he &s;aw it was nece&s;&s;ary at that time to keep the Nation from falling into extream di&s;order, and from becom|ing open to the common enemy: And therefore he only &s;tept in between the living and the dead, as he phra&s;ed it, in that in|terval, till God &s;hould direct them on what bottom they ought to &s;ettle: And he a&s;&s;ured them, that then he would &s;urrender the heavy load lying upon him, with a joy equal to the &s;orrow with which he was affected while under that &s;hew of dignity. To men of this &s;tamp he would enter into the terms of their old equality, &s;hutting the door, and making them &s;it down cove|red by him, to let them &s;ee how little he valued tho&s;e di&s;tances that for form's &s;ake he was bound to keep up with others. The&s;e di&s;cour&s;es commonly ended in a long prayer. Thus with much ado he managed the republican enthu&s;ia&s;ts. The other Republi|cans he called the Heathens, and profe&s;&s;ed he could not &s;o ea|&s;ily work upon them. He had &s;ome chaplains of all &s;orts: And he begun in his latter years to be gentler towards tho&s;e of the church of <HI>England.</HI> They had their meetings in &s;everal pla|ces about <HI>London</HI> without any di&s;turbance from him. In con|clu&s;ion, even the Papi&s;ts courted him: And he with great di&s;&s;i|mulation carried things with all &s;orts of people farther than was thought po&s;&s;ible, con&s;idering the difficulties he met with in all his Parliaments: But it was generally believed that his life and all his arts were exhau&s;ted at once, and that if he had lived much longer he could not have held things together.</P>
<P>The debates came on very high for &s;etting up a King. All the lawyers, chiefly <HI>Glyn, Maynard, Fountain,</HI> and <HI>St. Johns,</HI> were vehemently for this. They &s;aid, no new government could be &s;ettled legally but by a King, who &s;hould pa&s;s bills for &s;uch a form as &s;hould be agreed on. Till then all they did was like building upon &s;and: Still men were in danger of a revolution: And in that ca&s;e all that had been done would be void of it&s;elf, as contrary to a law yet in being and not repealed. Till that was done, every man that had been concerned in the war, and in the blood that was &s;hed, chiefly the King's, was &s;till obnox|ious: And no warrants could be pleaded, but what were found|ed on or approved of by a law pa&s;s'd by King, Lords, and Com|mons. They might agree to tru&s;t this King as much as they plea&s;ed, and to make his power determine as &s;oon as they plea|&s;ed, &s;o that he &s;hould be a <HI>Felo de &s;e,</HI> and con&s;ent to an act, if need were, of extingui&s;hing both name and thing for ever. And as no man's per&s;on was &s;afe till that was done, &s;o they &s;aid all
<PB N="69" REF="85">
the grants and &s;ales that had been made were null and void: All men that had gathered or di&s;po&s;ed of the publick money were for ever accountable. In &s;hort, this point was made out be|yond the po&s;&s;ibility of an&s;wering it, except upon enthu&s;ia&s;tick principles. But by that &s;ort of men all this was called a mi&s;tru&s;t|ing of God, and a tru&s;ting to the arm of fle&s;h: They had gone out, as they &s;aid, in the &s;implicity of their hearts to fight the Lord's battels, to whom they had made the appeal: He had heard them, and appeared for them, and now they could tru&s;t him no longer: They had pulled down monarchy with the monarch, and would they now build that up which they had de&s;troyed: They had &s;olemnly vowed to God to be true to the Common|wealth, without a King or King&s;hip: And under that vow, as un|der a banner, they had fought and prevailed: But now they mu&s;t be &s;ecure, and in order to that go back to <HI>Egypt:</HI> They thought, it was rather a happine&s;s that they were &s;till under a legal dan|ger: This might be a mean to make them more cautious and diligent: If Kings were invaders of God's right, and u&s;ur|pers upon mens liberties, why mu&s;t they have recour&s;e to &s;uch a wicked engine? Upon the&s;e grounds they &s;tood out: And they looked on all that was offered about the limiting this King in his power, as the gilding the pill: The a&s;&s;ertors of tho&s;e laws that made it nece&s;&s;ary to have a King would no &s;ooner have one, than they would bring forth out of the &s;ame &s;tore-hou&s;e all that related to the power and prerogative of this King: Therefore they would not hearken to any thing that was offer|ed on that head, but rejected it with &s;corn. Many of them began openly to &s;ay, if we mu&s;t have a King in con&s;equence of &s;o much law as was alledged, why &s;hould we not rather have that King to whom the law certainly pointed than any other? The Earl of <HI>Orrery</HI> told me, that, coming one day to <HI>Cromwell</HI> during tho&s;e heats, and telling him he had been in the City all that day, <HI>Cromwell</HI> a&s;ked him what news he had heard there: The other an&s;wered, that he was told he was in treaty with the King, who was to be re&s;tored and to marry his daughter. <HI>Cromwell</HI> expre&s;&s;ing no indignation at this, Lord <HI>Orrery</HI> &s;aid, in the &s;tate to which things were brought, he &s;aw not a better expedient: They might bring him in on what terms they plea|&s;ed: And <HI>Cromwell</HI> might retain the &s;ame authority he then had with le&s;s trouble. <HI>Cromwell</HI> an&s;wered, the King can never forgive his father's blood. <HI>Orrery</HI> &s;aid, he was one of many that were concerned in that, but he would be alone in the merit of re&s;toring him. <HI>Cromwell</HI> replied, he is &s;o damnably debauched he would undo us all; and &s;o turned to another di&s;cour&s;e without any
<PB N="70" REF="86" MS="Y">
emotion, which made <HI>Orrery</HI> conclude he had often thought of that expedient.</P>
<P>Before the day in which he refu&s;ed the offer of the King&s;hip that was made to him by the Parliament, he had kept him&s;elf on &s;uch a re&s;erve that no man knew what an&s;wer he would give. It was thought more likely he would accept of it: But that which determined him to the contrary was, that, when he went down in the morning to walk in St. <HI>James</HI>'s park, <HI>Fleetwood</HI> and <HI>Desborough</HI> were waiting for him: The one had married his daughter, and the other his &s;i&s;ter. With the&s;e he entered into much di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ubject, and argued for it: He &s;aid, it was a tempting of God to expo&s;e &s;o many worthy men to death and poverty, when there was a certain way to &s;ecure them. The others in&s;i&s;ted &s;till on the oaths they had taken. He &s;aid, the&s;e oaths were again&s;t the power and tyranny of Kings, but not again&s;t the four letters that made the word King. In con|clu&s;ion, they, believing from his di&s;cour&s;e that he intended to ac|cept of it, told him, they &s;aw great confu&s;ions would follow on it: And as they could not &s;erve him to &s;et up the idol they had put down, and had &s;worn to keep down, &s;o they would not engage in any thing again&s;t him, but would retire and look on. So they offered him their commi&s;&s;ions, &s;ince they were re&s;olved not to &s;erve a King: He de&s;ired they would &s;tay till they heard his an&s;wer. It was believed, that he, &s;eeing two per&s;ons &s;o near him ready to abandon him, concluded that many others would follow their example; and therefore thought it was too bold a venture. So he refu&s;ed it, but accepted of the continuance of his Protector&s;hip. Yet, if he had lived out the next winter, as the debates were to have been brought on again, &s;o it was ge|nerally thought he would have accepted of the offer. And it is yet a que&s;tion what the effect of that would have been. Some have thought it would have brought on a general &s;ettlement, &s;ince the law and the ancient government were again to take place: Others have fancied ju&s;t the contrary, that it would have engaged the Army, &s;o that they would either have de&s;erted the &s;ervice, or have revolted from him, and perhaps have killed him in the fir&s;t fray of the tumult. I will not determine which of the&s;e would have mo&s;t probably happened. In the&s;e debates &s;ome of the Cavalier party, or rather their children, came to bear &s;ome &s;hare. They were then all zealous Commonwealths-men, accord|ing to the directions &s;ent them from tho&s;e about the King. Their bu&s;ine&s;s was to oppo&s;e <HI>Cromwell</HI> on all his demands, and &s;o to weaken him at home and expo&s;e him abroad. When &s;ome of the other party took notice of this great change, from being
<PB N="71" REF="87">
the abettors of prerogative to become the patrons of liberty, they pretended their education in the Court and their obligation to it had engaged them that way; but now &s;ince that was out of doors, they had the common principles of human nature and the love of liberty in them. By this mean as the old republicans a&s;&s;i&s;ted and protected them, &s;o at the &s;ame time they &s;trength|ened the faction again&s;t <HI>Cromwell.</HI> But the&s;e very men at the Re&s;toration &s;hook off this di&s;gui&s;e, and reverted to their old principles for a high prerogative and ab&s;olute power. They &s;aid they were for liberty, when it was a mean to di&s;tre&s;s one who they thought had no right to govern; but when the govern|ment returned to its old channel, they were &s;till as firm to all prerogative notions, and as great enemies to liberty as ever.</P>
<P>I go next to give an account of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s tran&s;actions with <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cromwell</HI>'s engagement with <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> relation to foreign affairs. He laid it down for a maxim to &s;pare no co&s;t or charge in order to procure him intelligence. When he under&s;tood what dealers the <HI>Jews</HI> were every where in that trade that depends on news, the advancing money upon high or low intere&s;ts in proportion to the ri&s;que they run or the gain to be made as the times might turn, and in the buying and &s;el|ling of the actions of money &s;o advanced, he, more upon that account than in compliance with the principle of toleration, brought a company of them over to <HI>England,</HI> and gave them leave to build a Synagogue. All the while that he was negotia|ting this, they were &s;ure and good &s;pies for him, e&s;pecially with relation to <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Orrery</HI> told me, he was once walking with him in one of the galleries of <HI>White|hall,</HI> and a man almo&s;t in rags came in view: He pre&s;ently di&s;|mi&s;s'd Lord <HI>Orrery,</HI> and carried that man into his clo&s;et; who brought him an account of a great &s;um of money that the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> were &s;ending over to pay their army in <HI>Flanders,</HI> but in a <HI>Dutch</HI> man of war: And he told him the places of the &s;hip in which the money was lodged. <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;ent an expre&s;s imme|diately to <HI>Smith,</HI> afterwards Sir <HI>Jeremy Smith,</HI> who lay in the <HI>Downs,</HI> telling him that within a day or two &s;uch a <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hip would pa&s;s the channel, whom he mu&s;t vi&s;it for the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> money, which was conterband goods, we being then in war with <HI>Spain.</HI> So when the &s;hip pa&s;s'd by <HI>Dover, Smith</HI> &s;ent and demanded leave to &s;earch him. The <HI>Dutch</HI> captain an&s;wered, none but his ma&s;ters might &s;earch him. <HI>Smith</HI> &s;ent him word, he had &s;et up an hour gla&s;s, and if before that was run out he did not &s;ubmit to the &s;earch, he would force it. The Captain faw it was in vain to &s;truggle, and &s;o all the money was found. Next time that <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;aw <HI>Orrery</HI> he told him, he had his
<PB N="72" REF="88">
intelligence from that contemptible man he &s;aw him go to &s;ome days before. He had on all occa&s;ions very good intelligence: He knew every thing that pa&s;s'd in the King's little Court: And yet none of his &s;pies were di&s;covered, but one only.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t difficulty on him in his foreign affairs was, what &s;ide to chu&s;e, <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Spain.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> was then in the <HI>Netherlands</HI> with a great many Prote&s;tants about him. He &s;et the <HI>Spaniards</HI> on making great &s;teps towards the gaining <HI>Cromwell</HI> into their intere&s;ts. <HI>Spain</HI> ordered their Amba&s;&s;ador to compliment him: He was e&s;teemed one of their able&s;t men: His name was <HI>Don Alon&s;o de Cardenas:</HI> He offered that if <HI>Crom|well</HI> would join with them, they would engage them&s;elves to make no peace till he &s;hould recover <HI>Calais</HI> again to <HI>England.</HI> This was very agreeable to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who thought it would recommend him much to the Nation, if he could re&s;tore that town again to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Empire, after it had been a hundred years in the hands of the <HI>French. Mazarin</HI> hearing of this &s;ent one over to negotiate with him, but at fir&s;t without a cha|racter: And, to outbid the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> he offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>Cromwell</HI> to take <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> which was a place of much more importance. The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> &s;ent over likewi&s;e to offer <HI>Cromwell</HI> to turn Prote&s;tant; and, if he would give him a fleet with good troops, he would make a de&s;cent in <HI>Guienne,</HI> where he did not doubt but that he &s;hould be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Prote&s;tants; and that he &s;hould &s;o di&s;tre&s;s <HI>France,</HI> as to obtain &s;uch conditions for them, and for <HI>England,</HI> as <HI>Cromwell</HI> him&s;elf &s;hould dictate. Upon this offer <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;ent <HI>Stoupe</HI> round all <HI>France,</HI> to talk with their mo&s;t eminent men, to &s;ee into their &s;trength, into their pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition, the oppre&s;&s;ions they lay under, and their inclinati|ons to tru&s;t the Prince of <HI>Conde.</HI> He went from <HI>Paris</HI> down the <HI>Loire,</HI> then to <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> from thence to <HI>Montauban,</HI> and cro&s;s the &s;outh of <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Lions:</HI> He was in&s;tructed to talk to them only as a traveller, and to a&s;&s;ure them of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s zeal and care for them, which he magnified every where. The Prote&s;|tants were then very much at their ea&s;e: For <HI>Mazarin,</HI> who thought of nothing but to enrich his family, took care to main|tain the edicts better than they had been in any time former|ly. So <HI>Stoupe</HI> returned, and gave <HI>Cromwell</HI> an account of the ea&s;e they were then in, and of their re&s;olution to be quiet. They had a very bad opinion of the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> as a man who &s;ought nothing but his own greatne&s;s, to which they believed that he was ready to &s;acrifice all his friends, and every cau&s;e that he e&s;pou&s;ed. This &s;ettled <HI>Cromwell</HI> as to that particular. He al&s;o found that the Cardinal had &s;uch &s;pies on that Prince, that
<PB N="73" REF="89">
he knew every me&s;&s;age that had pa&s;&s;ed between them: There|fore he would have no farther corre&s;pondence with him: He &s;aid upon that to <HI>Stoupe, Stultus e&s;t, &amp; garrulus, &amp; venditur &agrave; &s;uis Cardinali.</HI> That which determined him afterwards in the choice was this: He found the parties grew &s;o &s;trong again&s;t him at home, that he &s;aw if the King or his brother were a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by <HI>France</HI> with an army of <HI>Huguenots</HI> to make a de&s;cent in <HI>England,</HI> which was threatned if he &s;hould join with <HI>Spain,</HI> this might prove very dangerous to him, who had &s;o many enemies at home and &s;o few friends. This particular con&s;ideration with relation to him&s;elf made great impre&s;&s;ion on him; for he knew the <HI>Spaniards</HI> could give tho&s;e Princes no &s;trength, nor had they any Prote&s;tant &s;ubjects to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in any $word$ de&s;ign. Upon this occa&s;ion King <HI>James</HI> told me, that among other prejudices he had at the Prote&s;tant religion this was one, that both his brother and him&s;elf, being in many companies in <HI>Pa|ris incognito,</HI> where they met many Prote&s;tants, he found they were all alienated from them, and were great admirers of <HI>Crom|well:</HI> So he believed they were all rebels in their heart. I an|&s;wered, that foreigners were no other way concerned in the quarrels of their neighbours, than to &s;ee who could or would a&s;|&s;i&s;t them: The coldne&s;s they had &s;een formerly in the Court of <HI>England</HI> with relation to them, and the zeal which was then ex|pre&s;&s;ed, mu&s;t naturally make them depend on one that &s;eemed re&s;olved to protect them. As the negotiation went on between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England, Cromwell</HI> would have the King and his brother di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Kingdom. <HI>Mazarin</HI> con&s;ented to this; for he thought it more honourable, that the <HI>French</HI> King &s;hould &s;end them away of his own accord, than that it &s;hould be done pur&s;uant to an article with <HI>Cromwell.</HI> Great excu&s;es were made for doing it: They had &s;ome money given them, and were &s;ent-away loaded with promi&s;es of con&s;tant &s;upplies that were never meant to be performed: And they retired to <HI>Colen;</HI> for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were not yet out of hope of gaining <HI>Cromwell.</HI> But when that vani&s;hed, they invited them to <HI>Bruxells,</HI> and they &s;ettled great appointments on them; in their way, which was always to promi&s;e much, how little &s;oever they could perform. They al&s;o &s;ettled a pay for &s;uch of the &s;ubjects of the three King|doms as would come and &s;erve under our Princes: But few came, except from <HI>Ireland:</HI> Of the&s;e &s;ome regiments were formed. But tho' this gave them a great and la&s;ting intere&s;t in our Court, e&s;pecially in King <HI>James</HI>'s, yet they did not much to de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>Before King <HI>Charles</HI> left <HI>Paris</HI> he changed his religion, but <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King turned Pa|p$$</NOTE> by who&s;e per&s;ua&s;ion is not yet known: Only Cardinal <HI>de Retz</HI>
<PB N="74" REF="90">
was on the &s;ecret, and Lord <HI>Aubigny</HI> had a great hand in it. It was kept a great &s;ecret. Chancellour <HI>Hide</HI> had &s;ome &s;u&s;pici|on of it, but would never &s;uffer him&s;elf to believe it quite. Soon after the Re&s;toration that Cardinal came over in di&s;gui&s;e, and had an audience of the King: What pa&s;s'd is not known. The fir&s;t ground I had to believe it was this: The Marquis <HI>de Roucy,</HI> who was the man of the greate&s;t family in <HI>France</HI> that continued Prote&s;tant to the la&s;t, was much pre&s;&s;ed by that Car|dinal to change his religion: He was his Kin&s;man and his par|ticular friend. Among other rea&s;ons one that he urged was, that the Prote&s;tant religion mu&s;t certainly be ruined, and that they could expect no protection from <HI>England,</HI> for to his certain knowledge both the Princes were already changed. <HI>Roucy</HI> told this in great confidence to his Mini&s;ter, who after his death &s;ent an adverti&s;ement of it to my &s;elf. Sir <HI>Allen Broderick,</HI> a great confident of the Chancellour's, who from being very athei&s;tical became in the la&s;t years of his life an eminent penitent, as he was a man of great parts, with whom I had lived long in great con|fidence, on his death-bed &s;ent me likewi&s;e an account of this matter, which he believed was done in <HI>Fontainebleau,</HI> before King <HI>Charles</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>Colen.</HI> As for King <HI>James,</HI> it &s;eems he was not reconciled at that time: For he told me, that being in a Mona&s;tery in <HI>Flanders,</HI> a Nun de&s;ired him to pray every day, that if he was not in the right way God would bring him into it: And he &s;aid, the impre&s;&s;ion the&s;e words made on him never left him till he changed.</P>
<P>To return to <HI>Cromwell:</HI> While he was balancing in his mind what was fit for him to do, <HI>Gage,</HI> who had been a Prie&s;t, came over from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and gave him &s;uch an account of the feeblene&s;s as well as of the wealth of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in tho&s;e parts, as made him conclude that it would be both a great and an <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cromwell</HI>'s de&s;ign on the <HI>We&s;t-In|dies</HI></NOTE> ea&s;y conque&s;t to &s;eize on their dominions. By this he reckoned he would be &s;upplied with &s;uch a trea&s;ure, that his govern|ment would be e&s;tabli&s;hed before he &s;hould need to have any re|cour&s;e to a Parliament for money. <HI>Spain</HI> would never admit of a peace with <HI>England</HI> between the tropicks: So he was in a &s;tate of war with them as to tho&s;e parts, even before he declared war in <HI>Europe.</HI> He upon that equipped a fleet with a force &s;ufficient, as he hoped, to have &s;eized <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> and <HI>Cuba.</HI> And <HI>Gage</HI> had a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;ucce&s;s in that expedition would make all the re&s;t fall into his hands. <HI>Stoupe,</HI> being on another occa&s;ion called to his clo&s;et, &s;aw him one day very intent in looking on a Map, and in mea&s;uring di&s;tances. <HI>Stoupe</HI> &s;aw it was a Map of the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and ob&s;erved who printed it. So, there
<PB N="75" REF="91">
being no di&s;cour&s;e upon that &s;ubject, <HI>Stoupe</HI> went next day to the Printer to buy the Map. The Printer denied he had prin|ted it. <HI>Stoupe</HI> affirmed he had &s;een it. Then, he &s;aid, it mu&s;t be only in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s hand; for he only had &s;ome of the Prints, and had given him a &s;trict charge to &s;ell none till he had leave given him. So <HI>Stoupe</HI> perceived there was a de&s;ign that way. And when the time of &s;etting out the fleet came on, all were in a gaze whither it was to go: Some fancied it was to rob the Church of <HI>Loretto,</HI> which did occa&s;ion a fortification to be drawn round it: Others talked of <HI>Rome</HI> it&s;elf; for <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s preachers had this often in their mouths, that if it were not for the divi|&s;ions at home he would go and &s;ack <HI>Babylon:</HI> Others talked of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> tho' he had not yet broke with the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> could not penetrate into the &s;ecret. <HI>Cromwell</HI> had not fini&s;hed his alliance with them: So he was not bound to give them an ac|count of the expedition. All he &s;aid upon it was, that he &s;ent out the fleet to guard the &s;eas, and to re&s;tore <HI>England</HI> to its do|minion on that element. <HI>Stoupe</HI> happened to &s;ay in a compa|ny, he believed the de&s;ign was on the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour, hearing that, &s;ent for him very privately, to a&s;k him upon what ground he &s;aid it: And he offered to lay down 10000 <HI>l.</HI> if he could make any di&s;covery of that. <HI>Stoupe</HI> own|ed to me he had a great mind to the money; and fancied he betrayed nothing if he did di&s;cover the grounds of the&s;e con|jectures, &s;ince nothing had been tru&s;ted to him: But he expected greater matters from <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and &s;o kept the &s;ecret; and &s;aid only, that in a diver&s;ity of conjectures that &s;eemed to him more probable than any others. But the Amba&s;&s;adour made no account of that; nor did he think it worth the writing to <HI>Don John,</HI> then at <HI>Bruxells,</HI> about it.</P>
<P><HI>Stoupe</HI> writ it over as his conjecture to one about the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> who at fir&s;t hearing it was per&s;uaded that mu&s;t be the de&s;ign, and went next day to &s;ugge&s;t it to <HI>Don John:</HI> But <HI>Don John</HI> relied &s;o much on the Amba&s;&s;adour, that this made no im|pre&s;&s;ion. And indeed all the Mini&s;ters whom he employed knew that they were not to di&s;turb him with trouble&s;ome news: Of which King <HI>Charles</HI> told a plea&s;ant &s;tory. One whom <HI>Don John</HI> was &s;ending to &s;ome Court in <HI>Germany</HI> coming to the King to a&s;k his commands, he de&s;ired him only to write him news: The <HI>Spaniard</HI> a&s;ked him, whether he would have true or fal&s;e news: And, when the King &s;eemed amazed at the que&s;tion, he added, if he writ him true news the King mu&s;t be &s;ecret, for he knew he mu&s;t write news to <HI>Don John</HI> that would be acceptable, true or fal&s;e: When the Mini&s;ters of that Court &s;hewed that they
<PB N="76" REF="92">
would be &s;erved in &s;uch a manner, it is no wonder to &s;ee how their affairs have declined. This matter of the fleet continued a great &s;ecret. And &s;ome months after that <HI>Stoupe</HI> being acci|dentally with <HI>Cromwell,</HI> one came from the fleet thro' <HI>Ireland</HI> with a letter. The bearer looked like one that brought no welcome news. And as &s;oon as <HI>Cromwell</HI> had read the letter, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed <HI>Stoupe,</HI> who went immediately to the Earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> then Lord <HI>Li&s;le,</HI> and told him what he had &s;een. He being of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Council went to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and came back, and told <HI>Stoupe</HI> of the de&s;cent made on <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and of the misfortune that had happened. It was then late, and was the po&s;t-night for <HI>Flan|ders.</HI> So <HI>Stoupe</HI> writ it as news to his corre&s;pondent, &s;ome days before the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour knew any thing of it. <HI>Don John</HI> was amazed at the news, and had never any regard for the Amba&s;&s;adour after that; but had a great opinion of <HI>Stoupe,</HI> and ordered the Amba&s;&s;adour to make him theirs at any rate. The Amba&s;&s;adour &s;ent for him, and a&s;ked him, now that it appeared he had gue&s;&s;ed right, what were his grounds: And when he told what they were, the Amba&s;&s;adour owned he had rea&s;on to conclude as he did upon what he &s;aw. And upon that he made great u&s;e of <HI>Stoupe:</HI> But he him&s;elf was never e&s;teemed after that &s;o much as he had been. This de&s;erved to be &s;et down &s;o particularly, &s;ince by it it appears that the greate&s;t de|&s;ign may be di&s;covered by an undue carele&s;ne&s;s. The Court of <HI>France</HI> was amazed at the undertaking, and was glad that it had mi&s;carried; for the Cardinal &s;aid, if he had &s;u&s;pected it, he would have made peace with <HI>Spain</HI> on any terms, rather than to have given way to that which would have been &s;uch an addition to <HI>England,</HI> as mu&s;t have brought all the wealth of the world into their hands. The fleet took <HI>Jamaica:</HI> But that was a &s;mall gain, tho' much magnified to cover the failing of the main de&s;ign. The war after that broke out, in which <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was indeed ta|ken, and put in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s hand: But the trade of <HI>England</HI> &s;uf|fered more in that, than in any former war: So he lo&s;t the heart of the city of <HI>London</HI> by that means.</P>
<P><HI>Cromwell</HI> had two &s;ignal occa&s;ions given him to &s;hew his zeal in protecting the Prote&s;tants abroad. The Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> rai|&s;ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">His zeal for the Prote&s;|tant re$$ $word$</NOTE> a new per&s;ecution of the <HI>Vaudois:</HI> So <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;ent to <HI>Ma|zarin,</HI> de&s;iring him to put a &s;top to that; adding, that he knew well they had that Duke in their power, and could re&s;train him as they plea&s;ed: And if they did not he mu&s;t pre&s;ently break with them. <HI>Mazarin</HI> objected to this as unrea&s;onable: He pro|mi&s;ed to do good offices: But he could not be obliged to an&s;wer for the effects they might have. This did not &s;atisfy <HI>Cromwell:</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="93">
So they obliged the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> to put a &s;top to that unju&s;t fury: And <HI>Cromwell</HI> rai&s;ed a great &s;um for the <HI>Vaudois,</HI> and &s;ent over <HI>Morland</HI> to &s;ettle all their concerns, and to &s;upply all their lo&s;&s;es. There was al&s;o a tumult in <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> in which &s;ome di&s;|order had been committed by the <HI>Huguenots:</HI> And they, appre|hending &s;evere proceedings upon it, &s;ent one over with great ex|pedition to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who &s;ent him back to <HI>Paris</HI> in an hour's time with a very effectual letter to his Amba&s;&s;adour, requiring him either to prevail that the matter might be pa&s;s'd over, or to come away immediately. <HI>Mazarin</HI> complained of this way of proceeding, as too imperious: But the nece&s;&s;ity of their affairs made him yield. The&s;e things rai&s;ed <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s character abroad, and made him be much depended on.</P>
<P>His Amba&s;&s;adour in <HI>France</HI> at this time was <HI>Lockhart,</HI> a <HI>Scotch|man,</HI> who had married his niece, and was in high favour with him, as he well de&s;erved to be. He was both a wi&s;e and a gal|lant man, calm and vertuous, and one that carried the genero|&s;ities of friend&s;hip very far. He was made governour of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and Amba&s;&s;adour at the &s;ame time. But he told me, that when he was &s;ent afterwards Amba&s;&s;adour by King <HI>Charles,</HI> he found he had nothing of that regard that was paid him in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s time.</P>
<P><HI>Stoupe</HI> told me of a great de&s;ign <HI>Cromwell</HI> had intended to begin his King&s;hip with, if he had a&s;&s;umed it: He re&s;olved to <NOTE PLACE="marg">A great de|&s;ign for the intere&s;t of the Prote&s;|tant reli|gion.</NOTE> &s;et up a Council for the Prote&s;tant religion, in oppo&s;ition to the congregation <HI>de Propaganda fide</HI> at <HI>Rome.</HI> He intended it &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of &s;even councellours, and four &s;ecretaries for different provinces. The&s;e were the fir&s;t, <HI>France, Switzerland,</HI> and the <HI>Valleys:</HI> The <HI>Palatinate</HI> and the other Calvini&s;ts were the &s;econd: <HI>Germany,</HI> the <HI>North,</HI> and <HI>Turkey</HI> were the third: And the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> were the fourth. The &s;ecretaries were to have 500 <HI>l.</HI> &s;alary apiece, and to keep a corre&s;pondence every where, to know the &s;tate of religion all over the world, that &s;o all good de&s;igns might be by their means protected and a&s;&s;i&s;ted. <HI>Stoupe</HI> was to have the fir&s;t Province. They were to have a fund of 10000 <HI>l.</HI> a year at their di&s;po&s;al for ordinary emergences, but to be far|ther &s;upplied as occa&s;ions &s;hould require it. <HI>Chel&s;ea</HI> college was to be made up for them, which was then an old decayed build|ing, that had been at fir&s;t rai&s;ed to be a college for writers of controver&s;y. I thought it was not fit to let &s;uch a project as this be quite lo&s;t: It was certainly a noble one: But how far he would have pur&s;ued it mu&s;t be left to conjecture.</P>
<P><HI>Stoupe</HI> told me a remarkable pa&s;&s;age in his employment un|der <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some $span$.</NOTE> <HI>Cromwell. Stoupe</HI> had de&s;ired all that were under the Prince
<PB N="78" REF="94">
of <HI>Conde</HI> to let him know &s;ome news, in return of that he writ to them. So he had a letter from one of them, giving an ac|count of an <HI>Iri&s;hman</HI> newly gone over, who had &s;aid he would kill <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and that he was to lodge in <HI>King-&s;treet We&s;tmin|&s;ter.</HI> With this <HI>Stoupe</HI> went to <HI>Whitehall. Cromwell</HI> being then at Council, he &s;ent him a note, letting him know that he had a bu&s;ine&s;s of great con&s;equence to lay before him. <HI>Cromwell</HI> was then upon a matter that did &s;o entirely po&s;&s;e&s;s him, that he, fan|cying it was only &s;ome piece of foreign intelligence, &s;ent <HI>Thurlo</HI> to know what it might be. <HI>Stoupe</HI> was troubled at this, but could not refu&s;e to &s;hew him his letter. <HI>Thurlo</HI> made no great matter of it: He &s;aid, they had many &s;uch adverti&s;ements &s;ent them, which &s;ignified nothing but to make the world think the Protector was in danger of his life: And the looking too much after the&s;e things had an appearance of fear, which did ill become &s;o great a man. <HI>Stoupe</HI> told him, <HI>King-&s;treet</HI> might be &s;oon &s;earched. <HI>Thurlo</HI> an&s;wered, if we find no &s;uch per&s;on, how &s;hall we be laught at? Yet he ordered him to write again to <HI>Bruxells,</HI> and promi&s;e any reward if a more particular di&s;|covery could be made. <HI>Stoupe</HI> was much ca&s;t down, when he &s;aw that a piece of intelligence which he hoped might have made his fortune was &s;o little con&s;idered. He wrote to <HI>Brux|ells:</HI> But he had no more from thence, but a confirmation of what had been writ formerly to him. And <HI>Thurlo</HI> did not think fit to make any &s;earch, or any farther inquiry into it: Nor did he &s;o much as acquaint <HI>Cromwell</HI> with it. <HI>Stoupe,</HI> being unea&s;y at this, told Lord <HI>Li&s;le</HI> of it: And it happened that, a few weeks after, <HI>Syndercomb</HI>'s de&s;ign of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating <HI>Cromwell</HI> near <HI>Brentford,</HI> as he was going to <HI>Hampton-court,</HI> was di&s;covered. When he was examined, it appeared that he was the per&s;on &s;et out in the letters from <HI>Bruxells.</HI> So <HI>Li&s;le</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> this is the ve|ry man of whom <HI>Stoupe</HI> had the notice given him. <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;eemed amazed at this; and &s;ent for <HI>Stoupe,</HI> and in great wrath reproached him for his ingratitude in concealing a matter of &s;uch con&s;equence to him. <HI>Stoupe</HI> upon this &s;hewed him the let|ters he had received; and put him in mind of the note he had &s;ent in to him, which was immediately after he had the fir&s;t let|ter, and that he had &s;ent out <HI>Thurlo</HI> to him. At that <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;eemed yet more amazed; and &s;ent for <HI>Thurlo,</HI> to who&s;e face <HI>Stoupe</HI> affirmed the matter: Nor did he deny any part of it; but only &s;aid, that he had many &s;uch adverti&s;ements &s;ent him, in which till this time he had never found any truth. <HI>Cromwell</HI> replied &s;ternly, that he ought to have acquainted him with it, and left him to judge of the importance of it. <HI>Thurlo</HI> de&s;ired
<PB N="79" REF="95">
to &s;peak in private with <HI>Cromwell.</HI> So <HI>Stoupe</HI> was di&s;mi&s;s'd, and went away not doubting but <HI>Thurlo</HI> would be di&s;graced. But, as he under&s;tood from <HI>Li&s;le</HI> afterward, <HI>Thurlo</HI> &s;hewed <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;uch in&s;tances of his care and fidelity on all &s;uch occa&s;ions, and humbly acknowledged his errour in this matter, but imputed it wholly to his care both for his honour and quiet, that he pa|cified him entirely: And indeed he was &s;o much in all <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s &s;ecrets, that it was not &s;afe to di&s;grace him without de&s;troying him; and that it &s;eems <HI>Cromwell</HI> could not re&s;olve on. <HI>Thurlo</HI> having ma&s;tered this point, that he might farther ju&s;tify his not being &s;o attentive as he ought to have been, did &s;o much &s;earch into <HI>Stoupe</HI>'s whole deportment, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>Crom|well</HI> with &s;uch an ill opinion of him, that after that he never treated him with any confidence. So he found how dangerous it was even to pre&s;erve a Prince, (&s;o he called him) when a Mini&s;ter was wounded in the doing of it; and that the Mini&s;ter would be too hard for the Prince, even tho' his own &s;afety was concerned in it.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all the memorable things that I have learnt concern|ing <HI>Cromwell;</HI> of whom &s;o few have &s;poken with any temper, &s;ome commending, and others condemning him, and both out of mea&s;ure, that I thought a ju&s;t account of him, which I had from &s;ure hands, might be no unacceptable thing. He never could &s;hake off the roughne&s;s of his education and temper: He &s;poke always long and very ungracefully. The enthu&s;ia&s;t and the di&s;&s;embler mixed &s;o equally in a great part of his deportment, that it was not ea&s;y to tell which was the prevailing character. He was indeed both, as I under&s;tood from <HI>Wilkins</HI> and <HI>Til|lot&s;on,</HI> the one having married his &s;i&s;ter, and the other his niece. He was a true enthu&s;ia&s;t, but with the principle former|ly mentioned, from which he might be ea&s;ily led into all the practices both of fal&s;hood and cruelty: Which was, that he thought moral laws were only binding on ordinary occa&s;ions, but that upon extraordinary ones the&s;e might be &s;uper&s;eded. When his own de&s;igns did not lead him out of the way, he was a lover of ju&s;tice and vertue, and even of learning, tho' much decried at that time.</P>
<P>He &s;tudied to &s;eek out able and hone&s;t men, and to employ <NOTE PLACE="marg">His modera|tion in go|vernment.</NOTE> them: And &s;o having heard that my father had a very great repu|tation in <HI>Scotland</HI> for piety and integrity, tho' he knew him to be a royali&s;t, he &s;ent to him, de&s;iring him to accept of a judge's place, and to do ju&s;tice in his own country, hoping only that he would not act again&s;t his government; but he would not pre&s;s him to &s;ub&s;cribe or &s;wear to it. My father refu&s;ed it in
<PB N="80" REF="96">
a plea&s;ant way. When he who brought the me&s;&s;age was run|ning out into <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s commendation, my father told a &s;tory of a Pilgrim in Popery, who came to a church where one Saint <HI>Kilmaclotius</HI> was in great reverence: So the Pilgrim was bid pray to him: But he an&s;wered, he knew nothing of him, for he was not in his breviary: But when he was told how great a Saint he was, he prayed this collect; <HI>O &s;ancte Kilmacloti, tu nobis hac|tenus es incognitus, hoc &s;olum &agrave; te rogo, ut &s;i bona tua nobis non pro|&s;int, &s;altem mala ne noceant.</HI> My father replied, that he de&s;ired no other favour of him but leave to live privately, without the impo&s;itions of oaths and &s;ub&s;criptions: And ever after he lived in great quiet. And this was an in&s;tance of it: <HI>Overton</HI> one of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s major generals, who was a high Republican, being for &s;ome time at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> where we then lived, my father and he were often together: In particular they were &s;hut up alone for about two hours the night after the order came from <HI>Crom|well</HI> to take away <HI>Overton</HI>'s commi&s;&s;ions, and to put him in ar|re&s;t. Upon that <HI>Howard,</HI> afterward Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> being &s;ent down to enquire into all the plots that tho&s;e men had been in, heard of this long privacy: But, when with that he heard what my father's character was, he made no farther enquiry into it; but &s;aid, <HI>Cromwell</HI> was very unea&s;y when any good man was que&s;ti|oned for any thing.</P>
<P>This gentlene&s;s had in a great mea&s;ure quieted people's minds with relation to him. And his maintaining the honour of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">His publick &s;pirit.</NOTE> Nation in all foreign countries gratifyed the vanity which is very natural to <HI>Engli&s;hmen;</HI> of which he was &s;o careful, that tho' he was not a crowned head, yet his Amba&s;&s;adours had all the re&s;pects paid them which our King's Amba&s;&s;adours ever had: He &s;aid, the dignity of the Crown was upon the account of the Nation, of which the King was only the repre&s;entative head; &s;o the Nation being &s;till the &s;ame, he would have the &s;ame re|gards paid to his Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of this plea&s;ed him much. <HI>Blake</HI> with the fleet happened to be at <HI>Malaga</HI> before he made war upon <HI>Spain:</HI> And &s;ome of his &s;eamen went a&s;hore, and met the Ho&s;tie car|ried about; and not only paid no re&s;pect to it, but laughed at tho&s;e who did: So one of the Prie&s;ts put the people on re|&s;enting this indignity; and they fell upon them, and beat them &s;everely. When they returned to their &s;hip they complained of this u&s;age: And upon that <HI>Blake</HI> &s;ent a trumpet to the Vice|roy, to demand the Prie&s;t who was the chief in&s;trument in that ill u&s;age. The Viceroy an&s;wered, he had no authority over the Prie&s;ts, and &s;o could not di&s;po&s;e of him. <HI>Blake</HI> upon that &s;ent
<PB N="81" REF="97">
him word, that he would not enquire who had the power to &s;end the Prie&s;t to him, but if he were not &s;ent within three hours he would burn their town: And they, being in no con|dition to re&s;i&s;t him, &s;ent the Prie&s;t to him, who ju&s;tified him|&s;elf upon the petulant behaviour of the &s;eamen. <HI>Blake</HI> an&s;wer|ed, that if he had &s;ent a complaint to him of it, he would have puni&s;hed them &s;everely, &s;ince he would not &s;uffer his men to affront the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of any place at which he touched: But he took it ill, that he &s;et on the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to do it; for he would have all the world to know, that an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> was only to be puni&s;hed by an <HI>Engli&s;hman:</HI> And &s;o he treated the Prie&s;t civilly, and &s;ent him back, being &s;atisfied that he had him at his mercy.</P>
<P><HI>Cromwell</HI> was much delighted with this, and read the letters <NOTE PLACE="marg">All the world was afraid of him.</NOTE> in Council with great &s;atisfaction; and &s;aid, he hoped he &s;hould make the name of an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> as great as ever that of a <HI>Roman</HI> had been. The States of <HI>Holland</HI> were in &s;uch dread of him, that they took care to give him no &s;ort of umbrage: And when at any time the King or his brothers came to &s;ee their &s;i&s;ter, the Prince&s;s royal, within a day or two after they u&s;ed to &s;end a deputation to let them know that <HI>Cromwell</HI> had required of the States that they &s;hould give them no harbour. King <HI>Charles,</HI> when he was &s;eeking for colours for the war with the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the year 1672, urged it for one, that they &s;uf|fered &s;ome of his rebels to live in their Provinces. <HI>Borel,</HI> then their Amba&s;&s;adour, an&s;wered, that it was a maxim of long &s;tanding among them, not to enquire upon what account &s;tran|gers came to live in their country, but to receive them all, un|le&s;s they had been concerned in con&s;piracies again&s;t the per&s;ons of Princes. The King told him upon that, how they had u&s;ed both him&s;elf and his brother. <HI>Borel,</HI> in great &s;implicity, an|&s;wered: <HI>Ha! &s;ire, c'e&s;toit une autre cho&s;e: Cromwell e&s;toit un grand homme, &amp; il &s;e fai&s;oit craindre &amp; par terre &amp; par mer.</HI> This was very rough. The King's an&s;wer was: <HI>Je me &s;eray crain|dre au&s;&s;y &agrave; mon tour:</HI> But he was &s;carce as good as his word.</P>
<P><HI>Cromwell</HI>'s favourite alliance was with <HI>Sweden. Carolus Gu&s;ta|vus</HI> and he lived in great conjunction of coun&s;els. Even <HI>Alger|noon Sydney,</HI> who was not inclined to think or &s;peak well of Kings, commended him to me; and &s;aid, he had ju&s;t notions of publick liberty; and added, that Queen <HI>Chri&s;tina</HI> &s;eemed to have them likewi&s;e. But &s;he was much changed from that, when I waited on her at <HI>Rome;</HI> for &s;he complained of us as a factious Nation, that did not readily comply with the commands of our Princes. All <HI>Italy</HI> trembled at the name of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and &s;eem|ed
<PB N="82" REF="98">
under a panick fear as long as he lived. His fleet &s;coured the <HI>Mediterranean:</HI> And the <HI>Turks</HI> dur&s;t not offend him; but deliver'd up <HI>Hide,</HI> who kept up the character of an Amba&s;&s;a|dour from the King there, and was brought over and execu|ted for it. The putting the brother of the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s Amba&s;&s;adour to death for murder, was the carrying ju&s;tice very far; &s;ince, tho' in the &s;trictne&s;s of the law of nations it is only the Amba&s;&s;adour's own per&s;on that is exempted from any autho|rity but his ma&s;ter's that &s;ends him, yet the practice had gone in favour of all that the Amba&s;&s;adour owned to belong to him. <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;hewed his good under&s;tanding in nothing more, than in &s;eeking out capable and worthy men for all employments, but mo&s;t particularly for the Courts of law, which gave a ge|neral &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Thus he lived, and at la&s;t died, on his au&s;picious third of <HI>Sep|tember,</HI> of &s;o &s;light a &s;ickne&s;s, that his death was not looked for. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The ruin of his fami|ly.</NOTE> He had two &s;ons, and four daughters. His &s;ons were weak, but hone&s;t men. <HI>Richard,</HI> the elde&s;t, tho' declared Protector in pur&s;u|ance of a nomination pretended to be made by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> the truth of which was much que&s;tioned, was not at all bred for bu&s;ine&s;s, nor indeed capable of it. He was innocent of all the ill his father had done: So there was no prejudice lay again&s;t him: And both the Royali&s;ts and the Pre&s;byterians fancied he favoured them, tho' he pretended to be an Independent. But all the Commonwealth party cried out upon his a&s;&s;uming the Protec|tor&s;hip, as a high u&s;urption; &s;ince whatever his father had from his Parliaments was only per&s;onal, and &s;o fell with him: Yet in oppo&s;ition to this, the City of <HI>London,</HI> and all the Coun|ties and Cities almo&s;t in <HI>England,</HI> &s;ent him addre&s;&s;es congratula|tory, as well as condoling. So little do the&s;e pompous appea|rances of re&s;pect &s;ignify. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> told me, that a week after <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s death he being by accident at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and hear|ing there was to be a fa&s;t that day in the hou&s;hold, he out of curio&s;ity went into the pre&s;ence chamber where it was held. On the one &s;ide of a table <HI>Richard</HI> with the re&s;t of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s family were placed, and &s;ix of the preachers were on the other &s;ide: <HI>Thomas Goodwin, Owen, Carril</HI> and <HI>Sterry</HI> were of the number. There he heard a great deal of &s;trange &s;tuff, enough to di&s;gu&s;t a man for ever of that enthu&s;ia&s;tick boldne&s;s. God was as it were reproached with <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s &s;ervices, and chal|lenged for taking him away &s;o &s;oon. <HI>Goodwin,</HI> who had pre|tended to a&s;&s;ure them in a prayer that he was not to die, which was but a very few minutes before he expired, had now the im|pudence to &s;ay to God, <HI>thou ha&s;t deceived us, and we were deceived.
<PB N="83" REF="99">
Sterry,</HI> praying for <HI>Richard,</HI> u&s;ed tho&s;e indecent words, next to bla&s;phemy, <HI>make him the brightne&s;s of the father's glory, and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on. Richard</HI> was put on giving his father a pompous funeral, by which his debts encrea&s;ed &s;o upon him, that he was &s;oon run out of all credit. When the Par|liament met, his party tried to get a recognition of his Protec|tor&s;hip: But it &s;oon appeared, they had no &s;trength to carry it. <HI>Fleetwood,</HI> who married <HI>Ireton</HI>'s Widow, &s;et up a Council of officers: And the&s;e re&s;olved to lay a&s;ide <HI>Richard,</HI> who had nei|ther genius nor friends, neither trea&s;ure nor army to &s;upport him. He de&s;ired only &s;ecurity for the debts he had contracted; which was promi&s;ed, but not performed. And &s;o without any &s;truggle he withdrew, and became a private man. And as he had done hurt to no body, &s;o no body did ever &s;tudy to hurt him, by a rare in&s;tance of the in&s;tability of human greatne&s;s, and of the &s;ecurity of innocence. His brother had been made by the father Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and had the mo&s;t &s;pirit of the two; but he could not &s;tand his ground, when his brother quit|ted his. One of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s daughters was married to <HI>Claypole,</HI> and died a little before him&s;elf: Another was married to the Earl of <HI>Falconbridge,</HI> a wi&s;e and worthy woman, more likely to have maintained the po&s;t than either of her brothers; according to a &s;aying that went of her, that tho&s;e who wore breeches de&s;erved petticoats better, but if tho&s;e in petticoats had been in breeches they would have held fa&s;ter. The other daughter was married, fir&s;t to the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>'s heir, and afterwards to one <HI>Ru&s;|&s;el.</HI> They were both very worthy per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Upon <HI>Richard</HI>'s leaving the &s;tage, the Commonwealth was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great di&s;or|ders follow|ed.</NOTE> again &s;et up: And the Parliament which <HI>Cromwell</HI> had broke was brought together: But the Army and they fell into new di&s;|putes: So they were again broke by the army: And upon that the Nation was like to fall into great convul&s;ions. The enthu&s;ia&s;ts became very fierce, and talked of nothing but the de&s;troying all the records and the law, which they &s;aid had been all made by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Tyrants and Papi&s;ts: So they re&s;olved to mo|del all anew by a levelling and a &s;piritual government of the Saints. There was &s;o little &s;en&s;e in this, that <HI>Nevil</HI> and <HI>Haring|ton</HI> with &s;ome others &s;et up in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> a meeting to con&s;ider of a form of government that &s;hould &s;ecure liberty, and yet pre|&s;erve the Nation. They ran chiefly on having a Parliament elected by ballot, in which the Nation &s;hould be repre&s;ented ac|cording to the proportion of what was paid in taxes towards the publick expence: And by this Parliament a Council of twenty four was to be cho&s;en by ballot: And every year eight of the&s;e were to
<PB N="84" REF="100">
be changed, and might not again be brought into it, but after an interval of three years: By the&s;e the Nation was to be go|verned: And they were to give an account of the admini&s;tra|tion to the Parliament every year. This meeting was a matter of diver&s;ion and &s;corn, to &s;ee a few per&s;ons take upon them to form a &s;cheme of government: And it made many conclude, it was nece&s;&s;ary to call home the King, that &s;o matters might again fall into their old channel. <HI>Lambert</HI> became the man on whom the Army depended mo&s;t. Upon his forcing the Parliament, great applications were made to <HI>Monk</HI> to declare for the Parlia|ment: But under this the declaring for the King was general|ly under&s;tood. Yet he kept him&s;elf under &s;uch a re&s;erve, that he declared all the while in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner for a Com|monwealth, and again&s;t a &s;ingle per&s;on, in particular again&s;t the King: So that none had any ground from him to believe he had any de&s;ign that way. Some have thought that he intend|ed to try, if it was po&s;&s;ible, to &s;et up for him&s;elf: Others rather believed, that he had no &s;ettled de&s;ign any way, and re&s;olved to do as occa&s;ion &s;hould be offered to him. The <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Nation did certainly hope he would bring home the King. He drew the greate&s;t part of the Army towards the borders, where <HI>Lam|bert</HI> advanced towards him with 7000 hor&s;e. <HI>Monk</HI> was &s;tron|ger in foot: But being apprehen&s;ive of engaging on di&s;ad|vantage, he &s;ent <HI>Clarges</HI> to the Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI> for his advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who returned an&s;wer by Dr. <HI>Fairfax,</HI> afterwards &s;ecre|tary to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and a&s;&s;ured him he would rai&s;e <HI>York&s;hire</HI> on the fir&s;t of <HI>January.</HI> And he de&s;ired him to pre&s;s upon <HI>Lambert,</HI> in ca&s;e that he &s;hould &s;end a detachment into <HI>York&s;hire.</HI> On the fir&s;t of <HI>January, Fairfax</HI> appeared with about 100 gentlemen and their &s;ervants. But &s;o much did he &s;till maintain his great credit with the Army, that the night after the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Brigade, that con&s;i&s;ted of 1200 hor&s;e and was the rear of <HI>Lambert</HI>'s army, came over to him. Upon that <HI>Lambert</HI> retreated, finding his army was &s;o little &s;ure to him, and re&s;olved to march back to <HI>London.</HI> He was followed by <HI>Monk,</HI> who when he came to <HI>York&s;hire</HI> met with <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and offered to re&s;ign the chief command to him. The Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI> refu&s;ed it, but pre&s;s'd <HI>Monk</HI> to declare for a free Parliament: Yet in that he was &s;o re&s;erved to him, that <HI>Fairfax</HI> knew not how to depend on him. But as <HI>Lambert</HI> was making ha&s;te up, his army mouldered away, and he him&s;elf was brought up a pri|&s;oner, and was put in the Tower of <HI>London.</HI> Yet not long af|ter he made his e&s;cape, and gathered a few troops about him in <HI>Northampton&s;hire.</HI> But the&s;e were &s;oon &s;cattered: For <HI>Ingoldsby,</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="101">
tho' one of the King's judges, rai&s;ed <HI>Buckingham&s;hire</HI> again&s;t him. And &s;o little force &s;eemed now in that party, that with very little oppo&s;ition <HI>Ingoldsby</HI> took him pri&s;oner, and brought him into <HI>Northampton:</HI> Where <HI>Lambert,</HI> as <HI>Ingoldsby</HI> told me, en|tertained him with a plea&s;ant reflection for all his misfortunes. The people were in great crouds applauding and rejoycing for the &s;ucce&s;s. So <HI>Lambert</HI> put <HI>Ingoldsby</HI> in mind of what <HI>Cromwell</HI> had &s;aid to them both, near that very place, in the year 1650, when they with a body of the officers were going down after their army that was marching to <HI>Scotland,</HI> the people all the while &s;houting and wi&s;hing them &s;ucce&s;s: <HI>Lambert</HI> upon that &s;aid to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> he was glad to &s;ee they had the Nation on their &s;ide: <HI>Cromwell</HI> an&s;wered, do not tru&s;t to that; for the&s;e very per&s;ons would &s;hout as much if you and I were going to be hanged. <HI>Lambert</HI> &s;aid, he looked on him&s;elf as in a fair way to that, and began to think <HI>Cromwell</HI> prophe&s;ied.</P>
<P>Upon the di&s;per&s;ing <HI>Lambert</HI>'s army, <HI>Monk</HI> marched &s;outh|ward, and was now the object of all men's hope. At <HI>London</HI> all &s;orts of people began to cabal together, Royali&s;ts, Presby|terians, and Republicans. <HI>Hollis</HI> told me, the Pre&s;byterians pre&s;|&s;ed the Royali&s;ts to be quiet, and to leave the game in their hands; for their appearing would give jealou&s;y, and hurt that which they meant to promote. He and <HI>A&s;hly Cooper, Grim|&s;tone</HI> and <HI>Anne&s;ly,</HI> met often with <HI>Manche&s;ter, Roberts,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Pre&s;byterian party: And the Mini&s;ters of <HI>London</HI> were very active in the City: So that when <HI>Monk</HI> came up, he was pre&s;&s;ed to declare him&s;elf. At fir&s;t he would only declare for the Parliament that <HI>Lambert</HI> had forced. But there was then a great fermentation all over the Nation. <HI>Monk</HI> and the Parlia|ment grew jealous of one another, even while they tried who could give the be&s;t words, and expre&s;s their confidence in the highe&s;t terms of one another. I will pur&s;ue the relation of this tran&s;action no farther: For this matter is well known.</P>
<P>The King had gone in Autumn 1659 to the meeting at the <NOTE PLACE="marg">All turn to the King's &s;ide.</NOTE> <HI>Pyrenees,</HI> where Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> and <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> were negotiating a peace. He applied him&s;elf to both &s;ides, to try what a&s;&s;i&s;tance he might expect upon their concluding the peace. It was then known, that he went to Ma&s;s &s;ometimes, that &s;o he might recommend him&s;elf the more effectually to both Courts: Yet this was carried &s;ecretly, and was confidently denied. <HI>Ma|zarin</HI> &s;till talked to <HI>Lockhart</HI> upon the foot of the old confi|dence: For he went thither to watch over the treaty; tho' <HI>Eng|land</HI> was now in &s;uch convul&s;ions, that no Mini&s;ter from thence could be much con&s;idered, unle&s;s it was upon his own account.
<PB N="86" REF="102">
But matters were ripening &s;o fa&s;t towards a revolution in <HI>England,</HI> that the King came back to <HI>Flanders</HI> in all ha&s;te, and went from thence to <HI>Breda. Lockhart</HI> had it in his power to have made a great fortune, if he had begun fir&s;t, and had brought the King to <HI>Dunkirk.</HI> As &s;oon as the peace of the <HI>Pyrenees</HI> was made, he came over and found <HI>Monk</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> and took all the pains he could to penetrate into his de&s;igns. But <HI>Monk</HI> continued &s;till to prote&s;t to him in the &s;olemne&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible, that he would be true to the Commonwealth, and again&s;t the Royal family. <HI>Lockhart</HI> went away, per&s;uaded that matters would con|tinue &s;till in the &s;ame &s;tate: So that when his old friend <HI>Midle|toun</HI> writ to him to make his own terms, if he would invite the King to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> he &s;aid, he was tru&s;ted by the Commonwealth, and could not betray it.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons put <HI>Monk</HI> on breaking the gates of the City of <HI>London,</HI> not doubting but that would render him &s;o odious to them, that it would force him to depend wholly on them&s;elves. He did it: And &s;oon after he &s;aw how odious he was become by it. So conceiving a high indignation at tho&s;e who had put him on &s;uch an ungracious piece of &s;ervice, he &s;ent about all that night to the Mini&s;ters and other active citizens, a&s;&s;uring them that he would quickly repair that errour, if they would forgive it. So the turn was &s;udden: For the City &s;ent and invited him to dine the next day at <HI>Guildhall:</HI> And there he declared for the members whom the Army had forced away in the year 47 and 48, who were known by the name of <HI>&s;eclu|ded members.</HI> And &s;ome happening to call the body that then &s;at at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> the Rump of a Parliament, a &s;udden humour run like a madne&s;s through the whole City, of roa&s;ting the Rumps of all &s;orts of animals. And thus the City expre&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves &s;ufficiently. Tho&s;e at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> had no &s;upport: So they fell unpitied, and unregarded. The &s;ecluded members came, and &s;ate down among them. But all they could do was to give or|ders for the &s;ummoning a new Parliament to meet the fir&s;t of <HI>May:</HI> And &s;o they declared them&s;elves di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>There was &s;till a murmuring in the Army. So great care was taken to &s;catter them in wide quarters, and not to &s;uffer too ma|ny <NOTE PLACE="marg">Care taken to manage the Army.</NOTE> of tho&s;e who were &s;till for the old cau&s;e to lie near one ano|ther. The well and the ill affected were &s;o mixed, that in ca&s;e of any in&s;urrection &s;ome might be ready at hand to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. They changed the officers that were ill affected, who were not thought fit to be tru&s;ted with the commanding tho&s;e of their own &s;tamp; and &s;o created a mi&s;tru&s;t between the officers and the &s;oul|diers. And above all they took care to have no more troops
<PB N="87" REF="103">
than was nece&s;&s;ary about the City: And the&s;e were the be&s;t af|fected. This was managed with great diligence and &s;kill: And by this conduct it was, that the great turn was brought about with|out the lea&s;t tumult or blood&s;hed, which was beyond what any per&s;on could have imagined. Of all this <HI>Monk</HI> had both the prai&s;e and the reward; tho' I have been told a very &s;mall &s;hare of it belonged to him. Admiral <HI>Montague</HI> was then in chief com|mand at &s;ea, newly returned from the <HI>Sound,</HI> where he and <HI>de Ruyter,</HI> upon the orders they received from their Ma&s;ters, had brought the two northern Kings to a peace, the King of <HI>Swe|den</HI> dying as it was a making up. He was &s;oon gained to be for the King; and dealt &s;o effectually with the whole Fleet, that the turn there was as &s;ilently brought about, without any revolt or oppo&s;ition, as it had been in the Army. The Republicans went about like madmen, to rou&s;e up their party. But their time was pa&s;t. All were either as men amazed or a&s;leep. They had neither the &s;kill, nor the courage to make any oppo&s;i|tion. The elections of Parliament men run all the other way. So they &s;aw their bu&s;ine&s;s was quite lo&s;t, and they felt them&s;elves &s;truck as with a &s;pirit of giddine&s;s. And then every man thought only how to &s;ave or &s;ecure him&s;elf. And now they &s;aw how de|ceitful the argument from &s;ucce&s;s was, which they had u&s;ed &s;o oft, and triumphed &s;o much upon. For whereas &s;ucce&s;s in the field, which was the foundation of their argument, depended much upon the conduct and courage of armies, in which the will of man had a large &s;hare, here was a thing of another na|ture: A Nation, that had run on long in &s;uch a fierce oppo|&s;ition to the Royal family, was now turned as one man to call home the King.</P>
<P>The Nation had one great happine&s;s during the long cour&s;e of the civil war, that no forreigners had got footing among them. <HI>Spain</HI> was &s;inking to nothing: <HI>France</HI> was under a ba&s;e &s;pirited Mini&s;ter: And both were in war all the while. Now a peace was made between them. Ad very probably, according to what is in <HI>Mazarin</HI>'s letters, they would have joined forces to have re&s;tored the King. The Nation was by this means en|tirely in its own hands: And now returning to its wits was in a condition to put every thing in joint again: Whereas, if fo|reigners had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any important place, they might have had a large &s;hare of the management, and would have been &s;ure of taking care of them&s;elves. Enthu&s;ia&s;m was now lan|guid: For that owing its mechanical force to the liveline&s;s of the blood and &s;pirits, men in di&s;order and depre&s;&s;ed could not rai&s;e in them&s;elves tho&s;e heats, with which they were formerly
<PB N="88" REF="104">
wont to tran&s;port both them&s;elves and others. Chancellour <HI>Hide</HI> was all this while very bu&s;y: He &s;ent over Dr. <HI>Morley,</HI> who talked much with the Pre&s;byterians of moderation in ge|neral, but would enter into no particulars: Only he took care to let them know he was a <HI>Calvini&s;t:</HI> And they had the be&s;t opinion of &s;uch of the Church of <HI>England</HI> as were of that per|&s;ua&s;ion. <HI>Hide</HI> wrote in the King's name to all the leading men, and got the King to write a great many letters in a very obliging manner. Some that had been faulty &s;ent over con&s;iderable pre|&s;ents, with a&s;&s;urances that they would redeem all that was pa&s;t with their zeal for the future. The&s;e were all accepted of. Their money was al&s;o very welcome; for the King needed money when his matters were on that cri&s;is and he had &s;o many tools at work. The management of all this was &s;o entirely the Chancellour's &s;in|gle performance, that there was &s;carce any other that had &s;o much as a &s;hare in it with him. He kept a regi&s;ter of all the King's promi&s;es, and of his own; and did all that lay in his pow|er afterwards to get them all to be performed. He was al&s;o all that while giving the King many wi&s;e and good advices. But he did it too much with the air of a governour, or of a lawyer. Yet then the King was wholly in his hands.</P>
<P>I need not open the &s;cene of the new Parliament, (or Con|vention, as it came afterwards to be called, becau&s;e it was not <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Par|liament.</NOTE> &s;ummoned by the King's writ:) Such unanimity appeared in their proceedings, that there was not the lea&s;t di&s;pute among them, but upon one &s;ingle point: Yet that was a very important one. <HI>Hale,</HI> afterwards the famous Chief Ju&s;tice, moved that a Com|mittee might be appointed to look into the propo&s;itions that had been made, and the conce&s;&s;ions that had been offered by the late King during the war, particularly at the treaty of <HI>Newport,</HI> that from thence they might dige&s;t &s;uch propo&s;itions as they &s;hould think fit to be &s;ent over to the King. This was &s;econded, but I do not remember by whom. It was fore&s;een, that &s;uch a motion might be &s;et on foot: So <HI>Monk</HI> was in&s;tructed how to an&s;wer it, when&s;oever it &s;hould be propo&s;ed. He told the Hou&s;e, that there was yet, beyond all mens hope, an univer&s;al quiet all over the Nation; but there were many incendiaries &s;till on the watch, trying where they could fir&s;t rai&s;e the flame. He &s;aid, he had &s;uch copious informations &s;ent him of the&s;e things, that it was not fit they &s;hould be generally known: He could not an&s;wer for the peace, either of the Nation or of the Army, if any delay was put to the &s;ending for the King: What need was there of &s;ending propo&s;itions to him? Might they not as well prepare them, and offer them to him, when he &s;hould come
<PB N="89" REF="105">
over? He was to bring neither army nor trea&s;ure with him, either to fright them or to corrupt them. So he moved, that they would immediately &s;end commi&s;&s;ioners to bring over the King: And &s;aid, that he mu&s;t lay the blame of all the blood or mi&s;chief that might follow on the heads of tho&s;e, who &s;hould &s;till in&s;i&s;t on any motion that might delay the pre&s;ent &s;ettlement of the Nation. This was echo'd with &s;uch a &s;hout over the Hou&s;e, that the motion was no more in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>This was indeed the great &s;ervice that <HI>Monk</HI> did. It was <NOTE PLACE="marg">They called home the King with|out a treaty.</NOTE> chiefly owing to the po&s;t he was in, and to the credit he had gained: For as to the Re&s;toration it&s;elf, the tide run &s;o &s;trong, that he only went into it dexterou&s;ly enough, to get much fame, and great rewards, for that which will have &s;till a great appea|rance in hi&s;tory. If he had died &s;oon after, he might have been more ju&s;tly admired, becau&s;e le&s;s known, and &s;een only in one advantageous light: But he lived long enough to make it known, how fal&s;e a judgment men are apt to make upon out|ward appearance. To the King's coming in without conditi|ons may be well imputed all the errours of his reign. And when the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> came to &s;ee what he was like to prove, he &s;aid once in great wrath to Chancellour <HI>Hide,</HI> it was to him they owed all they either felt or feared; for if he had not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them in all his letters with &s;uch an opinion of the King, they would have taken care to have put it out of his power either to do him&s;elf or them any mi&s;chief, which was like to be the effect of their tru&s;ting him &s;o entirely. <HI>Hide</HI> an|&s;wered, that he thought the King had &s;o true a judgment, and &s;o much good nature, that when the age of plea&s;ure &s;hould be over, and the idlene&s;s of his exile, which made him &s;eek new diver&s;ions for want of other employment, was turned to an obligation to mind affairs, then he would have &s;haken off tho&s;e entangle|ments. I mu&s;t put my reader in mind, that I leave all common tran&s;actions to ordinary books. If at any time I &s;ay things that occur in any books, it is partly to keep the thread of the nar|ration in an unintangled method, and partly, becau&s;e I neither have heard nor read tho&s;e things in books; or at lea&s;t, I do not remember to have read them &s;o clearly and &s;o particularly as I have related them. I now leave a mad and confu&s;ed &s;cene, to open a more augu&s;t and &s;plendid one.</P>

<P>_I DIVIDE King <HI>Charles</HI>'s reign into two books, not &s;o much becau&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty four <NOTE PLACE="marg">1660.</NOTE> years, it &s;ell, if divided at all, naturally to put twelve years in a book: But I have a much bet|ter rea&s;on for it, &s;ince as to the fir&s;t twelve years, tho' I knew the affairs of <HI>Scotland</HI> very au|thentically, yet I had only &s;uch a general knowledge of the af|fairs of <HI>England</HI> as I could pick up at a di&s;tance: Whereas I liv|ed
<PB N="92" REF="107">
&s;o near the &s;cene, and had indeed &s;uch a &s;hare in &s;everal parts of it, during the la&s;t twelve years, that I can write of the&s;e with much more certainty, as well as more fully, than of the fir&s;t twelve. I will therefore enlarge more particularly, within the compa&s;s that I have fixed for this book, on the affairs of <HI>Scotland;</HI> both out of the inbred love that all men have for their native country, and more particularly, that I may leave &s;ome u&s;eful in&s;tructions to tho&s;e of my own order and profe&s;&s;ion by repre&s;enting to them the conduct of the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Scotland:</HI> For having ob&s;erved with more than ordinary nicene&s;s all the errours that were committed, both at the fir&s;t &s;etting up of Epi&s;copa|cy, and in the whole progre&s;s of its continuance in <HI>Scotland</HI> till it was again overturned there, I am enabled to &s;et all that matter in a full view and in a clear light.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was fixed that the King was to be re&s;tored, a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Many went over to the <HI>Hague.</HI></NOTE> great many went over to make their court: Among the&s;e <HI>Sharp,</HI> who was employed by the re&s;olutioners of <HI>Scotland,</HI> was one. He carried with him a letter from the Earl of <HI>Glencairn</HI> to <HI>Hide,</HI> made &s;oon after Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> recommending him as the only per&s;on capable to manage the de&s;ign of &s;etting up Epi&s;co|pacy in <HI>Scotland:</HI> Upon which he was received into great con|fidence. Yet, as he had ob&s;erved very carefully the &s;ucce&s;s of <HI>Monk</HI>'s &s;olemn prote&s;tations again&s;t the King and for a Com|monwealth, it &s;eems he was &s;o plea&s;ed with the original that he re&s;olved to copy after it, without letting him&s;elf be diver|ted from it by &s;cruples: For he &s;tuck neither at &s;olemn pro|te&s;tations, both by word of mouth and by letters, (of which I have &s;een many proofs,) nor at appeals to God of his &s;inceri|ty in acting for the Pre&s;bytery both in prayers and on other occa|&s;ions, joining with the&s;e many dreadful imprecations on him|&s;elf if he did prevaricate. He was all the while maintained by the Pre&s;byterians as their agent, and continued to give them a con&s;tant account of the progre&s;s of his negotiation in their &s;er|vice, while he was indeed undermining it. This piece of craft was &s;o vi&s;ible, he having repeated his prote&s;tations to as many per&s;ons as then grew jealous of him, that when he threw off the ma&s;k, about a year after this, it laid a foundation of &s;uch a character of him, that nothing could ever bring people to any tolerable thoughts of a man, who&s;e di&s;&s;imulation and trea|chery was &s;o well known, and of which &s;o many proofs were to be &s;een under his own hand.</P>

and drunkenne&s;s, which over-run the three King|doms to &s;uch a degree, that it very much corrupted all their mo|rals. Under the colour of drinking the King's health, there were great di&s;orders and much riot every where: And the pre|tences of religion, both in tho&s;e of the hypocritical &s;ort, and of the more hone&s;t but no le&s;s pernicious enthu&s;ia&s;ts, gave great advantages, as well as they furni&s;hed much matter, to the prophane mockers of true piety. Tho&s;e who had been concern|ed in the former tran&s;actions thought, they could not redeem them&s;elves from the cen&s;ures and jealou&s;ies that tho&s;e brought on them by any method that was more &s;ure and more ea&s;y, than by going into the &s;tream, and laughing at all religion, telling or making &s;tories to expo&s;e both them&s;elves and their party as im|pious and ridiculous.</P>
<P>The King was then thirty years of age, and, as might have <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's character.</NOTE> been &s;uppo&s;ed, pa&s;t the levities of youth and the extravagance of plea&s;ure. He had a very good under&s;tanding. He knew well the &s;tate of affairs both at home and abroad. He had a &s;oftne&s;s of temper that charmed all who came near him, till they found how little they could depend on good looks, kind words, and fair promi&s;es; in which he was liberal to exce&s;s, be|cau&s;e he intended nothing by them, but to get rid of impor|tunities, and to &s;ilence all farther pre&s;&s;ing upon him. He &s;eem|ed to have no &s;en&s;e of religion: Both at prayers and &s;acrament he, as it were, took care to &s;atisfy people, that he was in no &s;ort concerned in that about which he was employed. So that he was very far from being an hypocrite, unle&s;s his a&s;&s;i&s;ting at tho&s;e performances was a &s;ort of hypocri&s;y, (as no doubt it was:) But he was &s;ure not to encrea&s;e that by any the lea&s;t appearance of religion. He &s;aid once to my &s;elf, he was no athei&s;t, but he could not think God would make a man mi&s;erable only for taking a little plea&s;ure out of the way. He di&s;gui&s;ed his Pope|ry to the la&s;t. But when he talked freely, he could not help letting him&s;elf out again&s;t the liberty that under the Reforma|tion all men took of enquiring into matters of religion: For from their enquiring into matters of religion they carried the humour farther, to enquire into matters of &s;tate. He &s;aid often, he thought government was a much &s;afer and ea&s;ier thing where the authority was believed infallible, and the faith and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion of the people was implicite: About which I had once much di&s;cour&s;e with him. He was affable and ea&s;y, and loved to be made &s;o by all about him. The great art of keeping him long was, the being ea&s;y, and the making every thing ea&s;y to him. He had made &s;uch ob&s;ervations on the <HI>French</HI> govern|ment,
<PB N="94" REF="109">
that he thought a King who might be checkt, or have his Mini&s;ters called to an account by a Parliament, was but a King in name. He had a great compa&s;s of knowledge, tho' he was never capable of much application or &s;tudy. He under|&s;tood the Mechanicks and Phy&s;ick; and was a good Chymi&s;t, and much &s;et on &s;everal preparations of Mercury, chiefly the fix|ing it. He under&s;tood navigation well: But above all he knew the architecture of &s;hips &s;o perfectly, that in that re&s;pect he was exact rather more than became a Prince. His apprehen&s;ion was quick, and his memory good. He was an everla&s;ting talker. He told his &s;tories with a good grace: But they came in his way too often. He had a very ill opinion both of men and women; and did not think that there was either &s;incerity or cha&s;|tity in the world out of principle, but that &s;ome had either the one or the other out of humour or vanity. He thought that no body did &s;erve him out of love: And &s;o he was quits with all the world, and loved others as little as he thought they loved him. He hated bu&s;ine&s;s, and could not be ea&s;ily brought to mind any: But when it was nece&s;&s;ary, and he was &s;et to it, he would &s;tay as long as his Mini&s;ters had work for him. The ruine of his reign, and of all his affairs, was occa&s;ioned chiefly by his delivering him&s;elf up at his fir&s;t coming over to a mad range of plea&s;ure. One of the race of the <HI>Villers,</HI> then married to <HI>Palmer,</HI> a Papi&s;t, &s;oon after made Earl of <HI>Ca&s;tlemain,</HI> who af|terwards being &s;eparated from him was advanced to be Duche&s;s of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> was his fir&s;t and longe&s;t mi&s;tre&s;s, by whom he had five children. She was a woman of great beauty, but mo&s;t enor|mou&s;ly vitious and ravenous; fooli&s;h but imperious, very unea|&s;y to the King, and always carrying on intrigues with other men, while yet &s;he pretended &s;he was jealous of him. His pa&s;&s;ion for her and her &s;trange behaviour towards him, did &s;o di&s;order him, that often he was not ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, nor ca|pable of minding bu&s;ine&s;s, which in &s;o critical a time required great application: But he did then &s;o entirely tru&s;t the Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> that he left all to his care, and &s;ubmitted to his ad|vices as to &s;o many oracles.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> was bred to the Law, and was like to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Clarendon</HI> character</NOTE> grow eminent in his profe&s;&s;ion when the wars began. He di&s;|tingui&s;hed him&s;elf &s;o in the Hou&s;e of Commons, that he became con&s;iderable, and was much tru&s;ted all the while the King was at <HI>Oxford.</HI> He &s;tayed beyond &s;ea following the King's fortune till the Re&s;toration; and was now an ab&s;olute favourite, and the chief or the only Mini&s;ter, but with too magi&s;terial a way. He was always pre&s;&s;ing the King to mind his affairs, but in vain.
<PB N="95" REF="110">
He was a good Chancellour, only a little too rough, but very impartial in the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. He never &s;eemed to under&s;tand foreign affairs well: And yet he meddled too much in them. He had too much levity in his wit, and did not al|ways ob&s;erve the decorum of his po&s;t. He was high, and was apt to reject tho&s;e who addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to him with too much contempt. He had &s;uch a regard to the King, that when places were di&s;po&s;ed of, even otherwi&s;e than as he advi&s;ed, yet he would ju&s;tify what the King did, and di&s;parage the preten|&s;ions of others, not without much &s;corn; which created him many enemies. He was indefatigable in bu&s;ine&s;s, tho' the gout did often di&s;able him from waiting on the King: Yet, during his credit, the King came con&s;tantly to him when he was laid up by it.</P>
<P>The next man in favour with the King was the Duke of <HI>Or|mond:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ormond</HI>'s character.</NOTE> A man every way fitted for a Court: Of a graceful appea|rance, a lively wit, and a cheerful temper: A man of great ex|pence, decent even in his vices, for he always kept up the form of religion. He had gone through many tran&s;actions in <HI>Ireland</HI> with more fidelity than &s;ucce&s;s. He had made a treaty with the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> which was broken by the great body of them, tho' &s;ome few of them adhered &s;till to him. But the whole <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Nation did &s;till pretend that, tho' they had broke the agreement fir&s;t, yet he, or rather the King in who&s;e name he had treated with them, was bound to perform all the articles of the treaty. He had mi&s;carried &s;o in the &s;iege of <HI>Dublin,</HI> that it very much le&s;|&s;ened the opinion of his military conduct. Yet his con&s;tant at|tendance on his ma&s;ter, his ea&s;ine&s;s to him, and his great &s;uffe|rings for him, rai&s;ed him to be Lord Steward of the Hou&s;hold, and Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland.</HI> He was firm to the Prote&s;tant religion, and &s;o far firm to the laws, that he always gave good advices: But when bad ones were followed, he was not for com|plaining too much of them.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> was next to the&s;e. He was a man <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Southamp|ton</HI>'s charac|ter.</NOTE> of great vertue, and of very good parts. He had a lively ap|prehen&s;ion, and a good judgment. He had merited much by his con&s;tant adhering to the King's intere&s;t during the war, and by the large &s;upplies he had &s;ent him every year during his exile; for he had a great e&s;tate, and only three daughters to inherit it. He was Lord Trea&s;urer: But he grew &s;oon weary of bu&s;ine&s;s; for as he was &s;ubject to the &s;tone, which returned often and violent|ly upon him, &s;o he retained the principles of liberty, and did not go into the violent mea&s;ures of the Court. When he &s;aw the King's temper, and his way of managing, or rather of &s;poil|ing
<PB N="96" REF="111">
bu&s;ine&s;s, he grew very unea&s;y, and kept him&s;elf more out of the way than was con&s;i&s;tent with that high po&s;t. The King &s;tood in &s;ome awe of him; and &s;aw how popular he would grow, if put out of his &s;ervice: And therefore he cho&s;e rather to bear with his ill humour and contradiction, than to di&s;mi&s;s him. He left the bu&s;ine&s;s of the trea&s;ury wholly in the hands of his &s;ecre|tary, Sir <HI>Philip Warwick,</HI> who was an hone&s;t but a weak man; under&s;tood the common road of the trea&s;ury, he was an incor|rupt man, and during &s;even years management of the trea&s;ury made but an ordinary fortune out of it. Before the Re&s;toration the Lord Trea&s;urer had but a &s;mall &s;alary, with an allowance for a table; but he gave, or rather &s;old, all the &s;ubaltern places, and made great profits out of the e&s;tate of the Crown: But now, that e&s;tate being gone, and the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> di&s;daining to &s;ell places, the matter was &s;ettled &s;o, that the Lord Trea&s;urer was to have 8000 <HI>l.</HI> a year, and the King was to name all the &s;ubal|tern officers. It continued to be &s;o all his time: But &s;ince that time the Lord Trea&s;urer has both the 8000 <HI>l.</HI> and a main hand in the di&s;po&s;ing of tho&s;e places.</P>
<P>The man that was in the greate&s;t credit with the Earl of <HI>South|ampton</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Shaftsbury</HI>'s character.</NOTE> was Sir <HI>Anthony A&s;hly Cooper,</HI> who had married his niece, and became afterwards &s;o con&s;iderable that he was rai&s;ed to be Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury.</HI> And &s;ince he came to have &s;o great a name, and that I knew him for many years in a very particular manner, I will dwell a little longer on his character; for it was of a very extra|ordinary compo&s;ition. He began to make a con&s;iderable figure very early. Before he was twenty he came into the Hou&s;e of Commons, and was on the King's &s;ide; and undertook to get <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire</HI> to declare for him: But he was not able to effect it. Yet Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> breaking articles to a town, that he had got to receive him, furni&s;hed him with an excu&s;e to for&s;ake that &s;ide, and to turn to the Parliament. He had a won|derful faculty in &s;peaking to a popular a&s;&s;embly, and could mix both the facetious and the &s;erious way of arguing very agreeably. He had a particular talent to make others tru&s;t to his judgment, and depend on it: And he brought over &s;o many to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;i|on to his opinion, that I never knew any man equal to him in the art of governing parties, and of making him&s;elf the head of them. He was as to religion a Dei&s;t at be&s;t: He had the dotage of A&s;trology in him to a high degree: He told me, that a <HI>Dutch</HI> doctor had from the &s;tars foretold him the whole &s;eries of his life. But that which was before him, when he told me this, proved fal&s;e, if he told me true: For he &s;aid, he was yet to be a greater man than he had been. He fancied, that after death our
<PB N="97" REF="112">
&s;ouls lived in &s;tars. He had a general knowledge of the &s;lighter parts of learning, but under&s;tood little to the bottom: So he triumphed in a rambling way of talking, but argued &s;lightly when he was held clo&s;e to any point. He had a wonderful fa|culty at oppo&s;ing, and running things down; but had not the like force in building up. He had &s;uch an extravagant vanity in &s;etting him&s;elf out, that it was very di&s;agreeable. He preten|ded that <HI>Cromwell</HI> offered to make him King. He was indeed of great u&s;e to him in with&s;tanding the enthu&s;ia&s;ts of that time. He was one of tho&s;e who pre&s;s'd him mo&s;t to accept of the King&s;hip, becau&s;e, as he &s;aid afterwards, he was &s;ure it would ruin him. His &s;trength lay in the knowledge of <HI>England,</HI> and of all the con&s;iderable men in it. He under&s;tood well the &s;ize of their un|der&s;tandings, and their tempers: And he knew how to apply him&s;elf to them &s;o dextrou&s;ly, that, tho' by his changing &s;ides &s;o often it was very vi&s;ible how little he was to be depended on, yet he was to the la&s;t much tru&s;ted by all the di&s;contented par|ty. He was not a&s;hamed to reckon up the many turns he had made: And he valued him&s;elf on the doing it at the propere&s;t &s;ea&s;on, and in the be&s;t manner. This he did with &s;o much va|nity, and &s;o little di&s;cretion, that he lo&s;t many by it. And his reputation was at la&s;t run &s;o low, that he could not have held much longer, had he not died in good time, either for his fa|mily or for his party: The former would have been ruined, if he had not &s;aved it by betraying the latter.</P>
<P>Another man, very near of the &s;ame &s;ort, who pa&s;&s;ed thro' <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Angle&s;ey</HI>'s character.</NOTE> many great employments, was <HI>Anne&s;ly,</HI> advanced to be Earl of <HI>Angle&s;ey;</HI> who had much more knowledge, and was very learn|ed, chiefly in the law. He had the faculty of &s;peaking indefatiga|bly upon every &s;ubject: But he &s;poke ungracefully; and did not know that he was not good at raillery, for he was always attempting it. He under&s;tood our government well, and had examined far into the original of our con&s;titution. He was capable of great application: And was a man of a grave deportment; but &s;tuck at nothing, and was a&s;hamed of nothing. He was neither loved nor tru&s;ted by any man or any &s;ide: And he &s;eemed to have no regard to common decencies: But &s;old every thing that was in his power: And &s;old him&s;elf &s;o often, that at la&s;t the price fell &s;o low, that he grew u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Hollis</HI> was a man of great courage, and of as great pride: He <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hollis</HI>'s cha|racter.</NOTE> was counted for many years the head of the Pre&s;byterian party. He was faithful and firm to his &s;ide, and never changed thro' the whole cour&s;e of his life. He engaged in a particular oppo|&s;ition to <HI>Cromwell</HI> in the time of the war. They hated one ano|ther
<PB N="98" REF="113">
equally. <HI>Hollis</HI> &s;eemed to carry this too far: For he would not allow <HI>Cromwell</HI> to have been either wi&s;e or brave; but often applied <HI>Solomon</HI>'s ob&s;ervation to him, <HI>that the battel was not to the &s;trong, nor favour to the man of under&s;tanding, but that time and chance happened to all men.</HI> He was well ver&s;ed in the re|cords of Parliament: And argued well, but too vehemently; for he could not bear contradiction. He had the &s;oul of an old &s;tubborn <HI>Roman</HI> in him. He was a faithful but a rough friend, and a &s;evere but fair enemy. He had a true &s;en&s;e of religion: And was a man of an unblamable cour&s;e of life, and of a &s;ound judgment when it was not bia&s;&s;ed by pa&s;&s;ion. He was made a Lord for his merits in bringing about the Re&s;toration.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> was made Lord Chamberlain: A man <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Manche&s;ter</HI>'s character.</NOTE> of a &s;oft and obliging temper, of no great depth, but univer&s;al|ly beloved, being both a vertuous and a generous man. The Lord <HI>Roberts</HI> was made Lord Privy Seal, afterwards Lord Lieu|tenant <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Roberts</HI>'s character.</NOTE> of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and at la&s;t Lord Pre&s;ident of the Council. He was a man of a more moro&s;e and cynical temper, ju&s;t in his ad|mini&s;tration, but vitious under the appearances of vertue: Learn|ed beyond any man of his quality, but intractable, &s;tiff and ob|&s;tinate, proud and jealous.</P>
<P>The&s;e five, whom I have named la&s;t, had the chief hand in engaging the Nation in the de&s;ign of the Re&s;toration. They had great credit, chiefly with the Pre&s;byterian party, and were men of much dexterity. So the thanks of that great turn was owing to them: And they were put in great po&s;ts by the Earl of <HI>Cla|rendon</HI>'s means. By which he lo&s;t mo&s;t of the Cavaliers, who could not bear the &s;eeing &s;uch men &s;o highly advanced, and &s;o much tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>At the King's fir&s;t coming over, <HI>Monk</HI> and <HI>Mountague</HI> were the mo&s;t con&s;idered. They both had the Garter. The one was made Duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> and the other Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and had noble e&s;tates given them. <HI>Monk</HI> was ravenous, as well as his wife, who was a mean contemptible creature. They both a&s;ked, and &s;old all that was within their reach, nothing being denied them for &s;ome time; till he became &s;o u&s;ele&s;s, that little per&s;o|nal regard could be paid him. But the King maintained &s;till the appearances of it: For the appearance of the &s;ervice he did him was &s;uch, that the King thought it fit to treat him with great di&s;tinction, even after he &s;aw into him, and de&s;pi&s;ed him. He took care to rai&s;e his kin&s;man <HI>Greenvill,</HI> who was made Earl of <HI>Bath</HI> and Groom of the Stole, a man who thought of nothing but of getting and &s;pending money. The Duke of <HI>Albemarle</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Clarges</HI>'s character.</NOTE> rai&s;ed two other per&s;ons. One was <HI>Clarges,</HI> his wife's brother,
<PB N="99" REF="114">
who was an hone&s;t but haughty man. He became afterwards a very con&s;iderable Parliament man, and valued him&s;elf on his op|po&s;ing the Court, and on his frugality in managing the publick money; for he had <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s oeconomy ever in his mouth, and was always for reducing the expence of war to the mode&s;ty and par&s;imony of tho&s;e times. Many thought he carried this too far: But it made him very popular. After he was become very rich him&s;elf by the publick money, he &s;eemed to take care that no body el&s;e &s;hould grow as rich as he was in that way. Another man rai&s;ed by the Duke of <HI>Albemarle</HI> was <HI>Morrice,</HI> who was the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Morrice</HI>'s character.</NOTE> per&s;on that had prevailed with <HI>Monk</HI> to declare for the King. Upon that he was made Secretary of State. He was very learn|ed, but full of pedantry and affectation. He had no true judg|ment about foreign affairs. And the Duke of <HI>Albemarle</HI>'s judg|ment of them may be mea&s;ured by what he &s;aid, when he found the King grew weary of <HI>Morrice,</HI> but that in regard to him had no mind to turn him out; He did not know what was nece&s;&s;ary for a good Secretary of State in which he was defective, for he could &s;peak <HI>French</HI> and write &s;hort hand.</P>
<P><HI>Nicolas</HI> was the other Secretary, who had been employed by <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nicolas</HI>'s character.</NOTE> King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t during the war, and had &s;erved him faith|fully, but had no under&s;tanding in foreign affairs. He was a man of vertue, but could not fall into the King's temper, or become acceptable to him. So not long after the Re&s;toration, <HI>Bennet,</HI> advanced afterwards to be Earl of <HI>Arlington,</HI> was by the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arlington</HI>'s character.</NOTE> intere&s;t of the Popi&s;h party made Secretary of State; and was admitted into &s;o particular a confidence, that he began to rai&s;e a party in oppo&s;ition to the Earl of <HI>Clarendon.</HI> He was a proud man. His parts were &s;olid, but not quick. He had the art of ob&s;erving the King's temper, and managing it beyond all the men of that time. He was believed a Papi&s;t. He had once pro|fe&s;&s;ed it: And when he died, he again reconciled him&s;elf to that Church. Yet in the whole cour&s;e of his mini&s;try, he &s;eemed to have made it a maxim, that the King ought to &s;hew no favour to Popery, but that all his affairs would be &s;poiled if ever he turned that way; which made the Papi&s;ts become his mortal enemies, and accu&s;e him as an apo&s;tate, and the betrayer of their intere&s;ts. His chief friend was <HI>Charles Berkely,</HI> made Earl of <HI>Falmouth,</HI> who without any vi&s;ible merit, unle&s;s it was the ma|naging the King's amours, was the mo&s;t ab&s;olute of all the King's favourites: And, which was peculiar to him&s;elf, he was as much in the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s favour as in the King's. <HI>Berkley</HI> was ge|nerous in his expence: And it was thought, if he had outlived the lewdne&s;s of that time, and come to a more &s;edate cour&s;e of
<PB N="100" REF="115">
life, he would have put the King on great and noble de&s;igns. This I &s;hould have thought more likely, if I had not had it from the Duke, who had &s;o wrong a ta&s;te, that there was rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect his judgment both of men and things. <HI>Bennet</HI> and <HI>Berke|ley</HI> had the management of the mi&s;tri&s;s. And all the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s enemies came about them: The chief of whom were the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e was a man of noble pre&s;ence. He had a <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bucking|ham</HI>'s cha|racter.</NOTE> great liveline&s;s of wit, and a peculiar faculty of turning all things into ridicule with bold figures and natural de&s;criptions. He had no &s;ort of literature: Only he was drawn into chymi&s;try: And for &s;ome years he thought he was very near the finding the phi|lo&s;opher's &s;tone; which had the effect that attends on all &s;uch men as he was, when they are drawn in, to lay out for it. He had no principles of religion, vertue, or friend&s;hip. Plea&s;ure, frolick, or extravagant diver&s;ion was all that he laid to heart. He was true to nothing, for he was not true to him&s;elf. He had no &s;teadine&s;s nor conduct: He could keep no &s;ecret, nor exe|cute any de&s;ign without &s;poiling it. He could never fix his thoughts, nor govern his e&s;tate, tho' then the greate&s;t in <HI>Eng|land.</HI> He was bred about the King: And for many years he had a great a&s;cendent over him: But he &s;pake of him to all per&s;ons with that contempt, that at la&s;t he drew a la&s;ting di&s;grace upon him&s;elf. And he at length ruined both body and mind, fortune and reputation equally. The madne&s;s of vice appeared in his per|&s;on in very eminent in&s;tances; &s;ince at la&s;t he became contemp|tible and poor, &s;ickly, and &s;unk in his parts, as well as in all other re&s;pects, &s;o that his conver&s;ation was as much avoided as ever it had been courted. He found the King, when he came from his travels in the year 45, newly come to <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;ent over by his father when his affairs declined: And finding the King enough inclined to receive ill impre&s;&s;ions, he, who was then got into all the impieties and vices of the age, &s;et him&s;elf to corrupt the King, in which he was too &s;ucce&s;sful, being &s;econded in that wicked de&s;ign by the Lord <HI>Percy.</HI> And to compleat the matter, <HI>Hobbs</HI> was brought to him, under the pretence of in|&s;tructing him in mathematicks: And he laid before him his &s;chemes, both with relation to religion and politicks, which made deep and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions on the King's mind. So that the main blame of the King's ill principles, and bad morals, was owing to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham.</HI></P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> was a man of courage and learning, of a <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>'s cha|racter.</NOTE> bold temper and a lively wit, but of no judgment nor &s;teadine&s;s. He was in the Queen's intere&s;t during the war at <HI>Oxford.</HI> And

he &s;tudied to drive things pa&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of a treaty, or any reconciliation; fancying that nothing would make the military men &s;o &s;ure to the King, as his being &s;ure to them, and giving them hopes of &s;haring the confi&s;cated e&s;tates among them; whereas, he thought, all di&s;cour&s;es of treaty made them feeble and fearful. When he went beyond &s;ea he turned Papi&s;t. But it was after a way of his own: For he loved to magnify the dif|ference between the Church and the Court of <HI>Rome.</HI> He was e&s;teemed a very good &s;peaker: But he was too copious, and too florid. He was &s;et at the head of the popi&s;h party, and was a violent enemy of the Earl of <HI>Clarendon.</HI></P>
<P>Having now &s;aid as much as &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lauderdale</HI> Character.</NOTE> &s;tate of the Court and Mini&s;try at the Re&s;toration, I will next give an account of the chief of the <HI>Scots,</HI> and of the parties that were formed among them. The Earl of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> afterwards made Duke, had been for many years a zealous Covenanter: But in the year forty &s;even he turned to the King's intere&s;ts; and had continued a pri&s;oner all the while after <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> fight, where he was taken. He was kept for &s;ome years in the tower of <HI>London,</HI> in <HI>Portland</HI> ca&s;tle, and in other pri&s;ons, till he was &s;et at liberty by tho&s;e who called home the King. So he went over to <HI>Holland.</HI> And &s;ince he continued &s;o long, and contrary to all mens opinions in &s;o high a degree of favour and confidence, it may be expected that I &s;hould be a little copious in &s;etting out his character; for I knew him very particularly. He made a very ill appearance: He was very big: His hair red, hanging odly about him: His tongue was too big for his mouth, which made him bedew all that he talked to: And his whole manner was rough and boi&s;terous, and very unfit for a Court. He was very learned, not only in <HI>Latin,</HI> in which he was a ma&s;ter, but in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>He|brew.</HI> He had read a great deal of divinity, and almo&s;t all the hi&s;torians ancient and modern: So that he had great materials. He had with the&s;e an extraordinary memory, and a copious but unpoli&s;hed expre&s;&s;ion. He was a man, as the Duke of <HI>Bucking|ham</HI> called him to me, of a blundering under&s;tanding. He was haughty beyond expre&s;&s;ion, abject to tho&s;e he &s;aw he mu&s;t &s;toop to, but imperious to all others. He had a violence of pa&s;|&s;ion that carried him often to fits like madne&s;s, in which he had no temper. If he took a thing wrong, it was a vain thing to &s;tudy to convince him: That would rather provoke him to &s;wear, he would never be of another mind: He was to be let a|lone: And perhaps he would have forgot what he had &s;aid, and come about of his own accord. He was the colde&s;t friend and the violente&s;t enemy I ever knew: I felt it too much not to
<PB N="102" REF="117">
know it. He at fir&s;t &s;eemed to de&s;pi&s;e wealth: But he deliver|ed him&s;elf up afterwards to luxury and &s;en&s;uality: And by that means he ran into a va&s;t expence, and &s;tuck at nothing that was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport it. In his long impri&s;onment he had great impre&s;&s;ions of religion on his mind: But he wore the&s;e out &s;o entirely, that &s;care any trace of them was left. His great expe|rience in affairs, his ready compliance with every thing that he thought would plea&s;e the King, and his bold offering at the mo&s;t de&s;perate coun&s;els, gained him &s;uch an intere&s;t in the King, that no attempt again&s;t him nor complaint of him could ever &s;hake it, till a decay of &s;trength and under&s;tanding forced him to let go his hold. He was in his principles much again&s;t Popery and arbitrary government: And yet by a fatal train of pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts he made way for the former, and had almo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h|ed the latter. And, whereas &s;ome by a &s;mooth deportment made the fir&s;t beginnings of tyranny le&s;s di&s;cernible and unaccepta|ble, he by the fury of his behaviour heightned the &s;everity of his mini&s;try, which was liker the cruelty of an inqui&s;ition than the legality of ju&s;tice. With all this he was a Pre&s;byterian, and re|tained his aver&s;ion to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. and his party to his death.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> had been his fellow pri&s;oner for ten <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Crawford</HI>'s character.</NOTE> years. And that was a good title for maintaining him in the po&s;t he had before, of being Lord Trea&s;urer. He was a &s;incere but weak man, pa&s;&s;ionate and indi&s;creet, and continued &s;till a zealous Pre&s;byterian. The Earl, afterwards Duke of <HI>Rothes,</HI> had <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rothes</HI>'s cha|racter.</NOTE> married his Daughter, and had the merit of a long impri&s;onment likewi&s;e to recommend him: He had a ready dexterity in the management of affairs, with a &s;oft and in&s;inuating addre&s;s: He had a quick apprehen&s;ion with a clear judgment: He had no advantage of education, no &s;ort of literature: Nor had he tra|velled abroad: All in him was mere nature.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Tweedale</HI> was another of Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tweedale</HI>'s character.</NOTE> friends. He was early engaged in bu&s;ine&s;s, and continued in it to a great age. He under&s;tood all the intere&s;ts and concerns of <HI>Scot|land</HI> well: He had a great &s;tock of knowledge, with a mild and obliging temper. He was of a blamele&s;s, or rather an exempla|ry, life in all re&s;pects. He had loo&s;e thoughts both of civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical government; and &s;eemed to think, that what form &s;oever was uppermo&s;t was to be complied with. He had been in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Parliament, and had abjured the Royal family, which lay heavy on him. But the di&s;putes about the guardian|&s;hip of the Duche&s;s of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and her elder &s;i&s;ter, to which he pretended in the right of his wife who was their father's
<PB N="103" REF="118">
&s;i&s;ter again&s;t her mother who was Lord <HI>Rothes</HI>'s &s;i&s;ter, drew him into that compliance which brought a great cloud upon him: Tho' he was in all other re&s;pects the able&s;t and worthie&s;t man of the nobility: Only he was too cautious and fearful.</P>
<P>A &s;on of the Marquis of <HI>Douglas,</HI> made Earl of <HI>Selkirk,</HI> had <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D Hamil|ton</HI>'s charac|ter.</NOTE> married the heire&s;s of the family of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who by her fa|ther's patent was Duche&s;s of <HI>Hamilton:</HI> And when the heire&s;s of a title in <HI>Scotland</HI> marries one not equal to her in rank, it is or|dinary at her de&s;ire to give her hu&s;band the title for life: So he was made Duke of <HI>Hamilton.</HI> He then pa&s;s'd for a &s;oft man, who minded nothing but the recovery of that family from the great debts under which it was &s;inking, till it was rai&s;ed up a|gain by his great management. After he had compa&s;&s;ed that, he became a more con&s;iderable man. He wanted all &s;ort of poli&s;hing: He was rough and &s;ullen, but candid and &s;incere. His temper was boi&s;terous, neither fit to &s;ubmit nor to govern. He was mutinous when out of power, and imperious in it. He wrote well, but &s;poke ill: For his judgment when calm, was better than his imagination. He made him&s;elf a great ma&s;ter in the knowledge of the laws, of the hi&s;tory, and of the fami|lies of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and &s;eemed always to have a regard to ju&s;tice, and the good of his country: But a narrow and &s;elfi&s;h temper brought &s;uch an habitual meane&s;s on him, that he was not capable of de&s;igning or undertaking great things.</P>
<P>Another man of that &s;ide, that made a good figure at that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Kincairdin</HI>'s character.</NOTE> time, was <HI>Bruce,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Kincairdin,</HI> who had mar|ried a daughter of Mr. <HI>Somel&s;dych</HI> in <HI>Holland:</HI> And by that means he had got acquaintance with our Princes beyond &s;ea, and had &s;upplied them liberally in their nece&s;&s;ities. He was both the wi&s;|e&s;t and the worthie&s;t man that belonged to his countrey, and fit for governing any affairs but his own; which he by a wrong turn, and by his love for the publick, neglected to his ruin; for they con&s;i&s;ting much in works, coals, &s;alt, and mines, requir|ed much care; and he was very capable of it, having gone far in mathematicks, and being a great ma&s;ter of mechanicks. His thoughts went &s;low, and his words came much &s;lower: But a deep judgment appeared in every thing he &s;aid or did. He had a noble zeal for ju&s;tice, in which even friend&s;hip could never bia&s;s him. He had &s;olid principles of religion and ver|tue, which &s;hewed them&s;elves with great lu&s;tre on all occa&s;i|ons. He was a faithful friend, and a merciful enemy. I may be perhaps inclined to carry his character too far; for he was the fir&s;t man that entred into friend&s;hip with me. We continu|ed for &s;eventeen years in &s;o entire a friend&s;hip, that there was
<PB N="104" REF="119">
never either re&s;erve or mi&s;take between us all the while till his death. And it was from him that I under&s;tood the whole &s;ecret of affairs; for he was tru&s;ted with every thing. He had a won|derful love to the King; and would never believe me, when I warned him, what he might look for, if he did not go along with an abject compliance in every thing. He found it true in conclu&s;ion. And the love he bore the King made his di&s;grace &s;ink deeper in him, than became &s;uch a philo&s;opher, or &s;o good a chri&s;tian as he was.</P>
<P>I now turn to another &s;et of men, of whom the Earls of <HI>Mi|dletoun</HI> and <HI>Glencairn</HI> were the chief. They were followed by the herd of the Cavalier party, who were now very fierce and full <NOTE PLACE="marg">The general character of the old Ca|valiers.</NOTE> of courage over their cups, tho' they had been very di&s;creet ma|nagers of it in the field, and in time of action. But now every one of them boa&s;ted that he had killed his thou&s;ands. And all were full of merit, and as full of high preten&s;ions; far beyond what all the wealth and revenues of <HI>Scotland</HI> could an&s;wer. The &s;ubtile&s;t of all Lord <HI>Midletoun</HI>'s friends was Sir <HI>Archibald Prime|ro&s;e:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Primero&s;e</HI>'s character.</NOTE> A man of long and great practice in affairs; for he and his father had &s;erved the Crown &s;ucce&s;&s;ively an hundred years all but one, when he was turned out of employment. He was a dextrous man in bu&s;ine&s;s: He had always expedients ready at every difficulty. He had an art of &s;peaking to all men according to their &s;en&s;e of things: And &s;o drew out their &s;ecrets while he concealed his own: For words went for nothing with him. He &s;aid every thing that was nece&s;&s;ary to per&s;uade tho&s;e he &s;poke to, that he was of their mind; and did it in &s;o genuine a way that he &s;eemed to &s;peak his heart. He was always for &s;oft coun&s;els, and &s;low methods: And thought that the chief thing that a great man ought to do was, to rai&s;e his family and his kindred, who naturally &s;tick to him; for he had &s;een &s;o much of the world, that he did not depend much on friends, and &s;o took no care in making any. He always advi&s;ed the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> to go &s;lowly in the King's bu&s;ine&s;s; but to do his own effectually, be|fore the King &s;hould &s;ee he had no farther occa&s;ion for him. That Earl had another friend, who had more credit with him, tho' <HI>Primero&s;e</HI> was more nece&s;&s;ary for managing a Parliament: He was Sir <HI>John Fletcher,</HI> made the King's Advocate or Attor|ney <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fletcher</HI>'s character.</NOTE> General: For <HI>Nicol&s;on</HI> was dead. <HI>Fletcher</HI> was a man of a generous temper, who de&s;pi&s;ed wealth, except as it was nece&s;&s;a|ry to &s;upport a va&s;t expence. He was a bold and fierce man, who hated all mild proceedings, and could &s;carce &s;peak with decency or patience to tho&s;e of the other &s;ide. So that he was looked on by all that had been faulty in the late times, as an
<PB N="105" REF="120">
Inqui&s;itor General. On the other hand <HI>Primero&s;e</HI> took money liberally, and was the interce&s;&s;or for all who made &s;uch effectu|al applications to him.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that was to be thought on, with relation to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Advices of|fered in <HI>Scot|ti&s;h</HI> affairs.</NOTE> <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> affairs, was the manner in which offenders in the late times were to be treated: For all were at mercy. In the letter the King writ from <HI>Breda</HI> to the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> he had promi&s;ed a full indemnity for all that was pa&s;t, excepting only tho&s;e who had been concerned in his father's death: To which the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> per&s;uaded the King to adhere in a mo&s;t &s;acred manner; &s;ince the breaking of faith in &s;uch a point was that which mu&s;t for ever de&s;troy confidence, and the ob&s;erv|ing all &s;uch promi&s;es &s;eemed to be a fundamental maxim in government, which was to be maintained in &s;uch a manner, that not &s;o much as a &s;tretch was to be made in it. But there was no promi&s;e made for <HI>Scotland:</HI> So all the Cavaliers, as they were full of revenge, hoped to have the e&s;tates of tho&s;e who had been concerned in the late wars divided among them. The Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> told the King, on the other hand, that the <NOTE PLACE="marg">For a gene|ral indemni|ty.</NOTE> <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> nation had turned eminently, tho' unfortunately, to &s;erve his father in the year forty eight; that they had brought him&s;elf a|mong them, and had lo&s;t two armies in his &s;ervice, and had been under nine years oppre&s;&s;ion on that account; that they had encou|raged and a&s;&s;i&s;ted <HI>Monk</HI> in all he did: They might be therefore highly di&s;gu&s;ted, if they &s;hould not have the &s;ame mea&s;ure of grace and pardon that he was to give <HI>England.</HI> Be&s;ides, the King, while he was in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had in the Parliament of <HI>Ster|ling</HI> pa&s;s'd a very full act of indemnity, tho' in the terms and with the title of an act of approbation. It is true, the records of that Parliament were not ex&s;tant, but had been lo&s;t in the confu&s;ion that followed upon the reduction of that Kingdom: Yet the thing was &s;o fre&s;h in every man's memory, that it might have a ve|ry ill effect, if the King &s;hould proceed without a regard to it. There was indeed another very &s;evere act made in that Parlia|ment again&s;t all that &s;hould treat or &s;ubmit to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> or com|ply in any &s;ort with him: But, he &s;aid, a difference ought to be made between tho&s;e who during the &s;truggle had de&s;erted the &s;ervice and gone over to the enemy, of which number it might be fit to make &s;ome examples, and the re&s;t of the kingdom, who upon the general reduction had been forced to capitulate: It would be hard to puni&s;h any for &s;ubmitting to a &s;uperior force, when they were in no condition to re&s;i&s;t it. This &s;eemed rea|&s;onable: And the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> acquie&s;ced in it. But the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> and his party complained of it, and de&s;ired that
<PB N="106" REF="121">
the Marquis of <HI>Argile,</HI> whom they charged with an acce&s;&s;ion to the King's murder, and &s;ome few of tho&s;e who had joined in the remon&s;trance while the King was in <HI>Scotland,</HI> might be pro|ceeded again&s;t. The Marquis of <HI>Argile</HI>'s craft made them affraid of him: And his E&s;tate made them de&s;ire to divide it among them. His &s;on, the Lord <HI>Lorn,</HI> was come up to Court, and was well received by the King: For he had adhered &s;o firmly to the King's intere&s;t, that he would never enter into any engage|ments with the U&s;urpers: And upon every new occa&s;ion of jea|lou&s;y he had been clapt up. In one of his impri&s;onments he had a terrible accident from a cannon bullet, which the &s;oldiers were throwing to exerci&s;e their &s;trength, and by a recoil &s;truck him in the head, and made &s;uch a fracture in his &s;kull, that the o|peration of the trepan, and the cure, was counted one of the greate&s;t performances of &s;urgery at that time. The difference between his father and him went on to a total breach; &s;o that his father was &s;et upon the di&s;inheriting him of all that was &s;till left in his power. Upon the Re&s;toration the Marquis of <HI>Argile</HI> went up to the Highlands for &s;ome time, till he advi&s;ed with his friends what to do, who were divided in opinion. He writ by his &s;on to the King, a&s;king leave to come and wait on him. The King gave an an&s;wer that &s;eemed to encourage it, but did not bind him to any thing. I have forgot the words: There was an equivocating in them that did not become a Prince: But his &s;on told me, he wrote them very particularly to his father, without any advice of his own. Upon that the Marquis of <HI>Ar|gile</HI> came up &s;o &s;ecretly, that he was within <HI>White-hall,</HI> before his enemies knew any thing of his journey. He &s;ent his &s;on to the King to beg admittance. But in&s;tead of that he was &s;ent to the Tower. And orders were &s;ent down for clapping up three <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Argile</HI> &s;ent to the Tow|er.</NOTE> of the chief Remon&s;trators. Of the&s;e <HI>Wari&s;toun</HI> was one: But he had notice &s;ent him before the me&s;&s;enger came: So he made his e&s;cape, and went beyond &s;ea, fir&s;t to <HI>Hamburgh.</HI> He had been long courted by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and had &s;tood at a di&s;tance from him for &s;even years: But in the la&s;t year of his government he had gone into his coun&s;els, and was &s;ummoned as one of his Peers to the other Hou&s;e, as it was called. He was after that put in|to the Council of &s;tate after <HI>Richard</HI> was put out: And then he &s;at in another court put up by <HI>Lambert</HI> and the Army, called the Committee of &s;afety. So there was a great deal again&s;t him. <HI>Swin|ton,</HI> one of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Lords, was al&s;o &s;ent a pri&s;oner to <HI>Scotland.</HI> And thus it was re&s;olved to make a few examples in the Parlia|ment that was to be called, as &s;oon as the King could be got to prepare matters for it. It was re&s;olved on, to re&s;tore the King's
<PB N="107" REF="122">
authority to the &s;ame &s;tate it was in before the wars, and to rai&s;e &s;uch a force as might be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the quiet of that kingdom for the future.</P>
<P>It was a harder point, what to do with the citadels that were <NOTE PLACE="marg">The citadels in <HI>Scotland</HI> demoli&s;h'd.</NOTE> built by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> garri&s;ons that were kept in them. Many &s;aid, it was nece&s;&s;ary to keep that kingdom in that &s;ubdued &s;tate; at lea&s;t till all things were &s;ettled, and that there was no more danger from thence. The Earl of <HI>Claren|don</HI> was of this mind. But the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> laid before the King, that the conque&s;t <HI>Cromwell</HI> had made of <HI>Scotland</HI> was for their adhering to him: He might then judge what they would think, who had &s;uffered &s;o much and &s;o long on his ac|count; if the &s;ame thraldome &s;hould be now kept up by his means: It would create an univer&s;al di&s;gu&s;t. He told the King, that the time might come, in which he would wi&s;h rather to have <HI>Scotch</HI> garri&s;ons in <HI>England:</HI> It would become a national quarrel, and loo&s;e the affections of the country to &s;uch a degree, that per|haps they would join with the garri&s;ons, if any disjointing hap|pen'd in <HI>England</HI> again&s;t him: Whereas, without any &s;uch badge of &s;lavery, <HI>Scotland</HI> might be &s;o managed, that they might be made entirely his. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> and his party dur&s;t not appear for &s;o unpopular a thing. So it was agreed on, that the citadels &s;hould be evacuated and &s;lighted, as &s;oon as the money could be rai&s;ed in <HI>England</HI> for paying and di&s;banding the Army. Of all this the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was believed the chief advi&s;er. So he became very popular in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The next thing that fell under con&s;ideration was the Church, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;putes concerning Epi&s;copacy.</NOTE> and whether Bi&s;hops were to be re&s;tored, or not. The Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> at his fir&s;t coming to the King &s;tuck firm to Pre&s;by|tery. He told me, the King &s;poke to him to let that go, for it was not a religion for gentlemen. He being really a Pre&s;by|terian, but at the &s;ame time re&s;olving to get into the King's confidence, &s;tudied to convince the King by a very &s;ubtil me|thod to keep up Pre&s;bytery &s;till in <HI>Scotland.</HI> He told him, that both King <HI>James</HI> and his father had ruined their affairs by en|gaging in the de&s;ign of &s;etting up Epi&s;copacy in that kingdom: And by that means <HI>Scotland</HI> became di&s;contented, and was of no u&s;e to them: Whereas the King ought to govern them ac|cording to the grain of their own inclinations, and to make them &s;ure to him: He ought, in&s;tead of endeavouring an uniformity in both kingdoms, to keep up the oppo&s;ition between them, and rather to encrea&s;e than to allay that hatred that was between them: And then the <HI>Scots</HI> would be ready, and might be ea&s;ily brought to &s;erve him upon any occa&s;ion of di&s;pute he might
<PB N="108" REF="123">
afterwards have with the Parliament of <HI>England:</HI> All things were then &s;mooth: But that was the honey moon, and it could not la&s;t long: Nothing would keep <HI>England</HI> more in awe, than if they &s;aw <HI>Scotland</HI> firm in their duty and affection to him: Whereas nothing gave them &s;o much heart, as when they knew <HI>Scotland</HI> was disjointed: It was a vain attempt to think of do|ing any thing in <HI>England</HI> by means of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> who were a de&s;picable people, and had a &s;ea to pa&s;s: But <HI>Scotland</HI> could be brought to engage for the King in a more &s;ilent manner, and could &s;erve him more effectually: He therefore laid it down for a maxim, from which the King ought never to depart, that <HI>Scotland</HI> was to be kept quiet and in good humour, that the op|po&s;ition of the two kingdoms was to be kept up and heighten'd: And then the King might reckon on every man capable of bearing arms in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as a li&s;ted &s;oldier, who would willing|ly change a bad country for a better. This was the plan he laid before the King. I cannot tell, whether this was to co|ver his zeal for Pre&s;bytery, or on de&s;ign to encourage the King to &s;et up arbitrary government in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>To fortify the&s;e advi&s;es he wrote a long letter in white ink to a Daughter of the Earl of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ilis,</HI> Lady <HI>Margaret Kennedy,</HI> who was in great credit with the party, and was looked on as a very wi&s;e and good woman, and was out of mea&s;ure zealous for them. I married her afterwards, and after her death found this letter among her papers: In which he expre&s;&s;ed great zeal for the cau&s;e: He &s;aw the King was indifferent in the mat|ter: But he was ea&s;y to tho&s;e who pre&s;&s;ed for a change: Which, he &s;aid, nothing could &s;o effectually hinder, as the &s;ending up many men of good &s;en&s;e, but without any noi&s;e, who might inform the King of the aver&s;ion the nation had to that govern|ment, and a&s;&s;ure him that, if in that point he would be ea&s;y to them, he might depend upon them as to every thing el&s;e; and particularly, if he &s;tood in need of their &s;ervice in his other do|minions: But he charged her to tru&s;t very few of the Mini&s;ters with this, and to take care that <HI>Sharp</HI> might know nothing of it: For he was then jealous of him. This had all the effect that the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> intended by it. The King was no more jealous of his favouring Pre&s;bytery; but looked on him as a fit in&s;trument to manage <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to &s;erve him in the mo&s;t de&s;perate de&s;igns: And on this all his credit with the King was founded. In the mean time <HI>Sharp,</HI> &s;eeing the King cold in the matter of Epi&s;copacy, thought it was nece&s;&s;ary to lay the Pre&s;byterians a&s;leep, to make them apprehend no danger to their government, and to engage the Publick Re&s;olutioners to proceed

again&s;t all the Prote&s;ters; that &s;o tho&s;e who were like to be the mo&s;t inflexible in the point of Epi&s;copacy might be cen&s;ured by their own party, and by that means the others might be|come &s;o odious to the more violent Pre&s;byterians, that thereby they might be the more ea&s;ily di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ubmit to Epi&s;copacy, or at lea&s;t might have le&s;s credit to act again&s;t it. So he, being pre&s;s'd by tho&s;e who employed him to procure &s;omewhat from the King that might look like a confirmation of their go|vernment, and put to &s;ilence all di&s;cour&s;es of an intended change, obtained by the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s means, that a letter &s;hould be writ by the King to the Pre&s;bytery of <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> to be com|municated by them to all the other Pre&s;byteries in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in which he confirmed the General A&s;&s;emblies that &s;ate at St. <HI>An|drews</HI> and <HI>Dundee</HI> while he was in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that had con|firmed the publick re&s;olutions; in which he ordered them to pro|ceed to cen&s;ure all tho&s;e who had then prote&s;ted again&s;t them, and would not now &s;ubmit to them. The King did al&s;o confirm their Pre&s;byterian government, as it was by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. This was &s;igned, and &s;ent down without communicating it to the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> or his party. But as &s;oon as he heard of it, he thought <HI>Sharp</HI> had betrayed the de&s;ign; and &s;ent for him, and charged him with it. <HI>Sharp</HI> &s;aid, in his own excu&s;e, that &s;omewhat mu&s;t be done for quieting the Pre&s;byterians, who were beginning to take the allarm: That might have produced &s;uch applications, as would perhaps make &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on the King: Whereas now all was &s;ecured, and yet the King was engaged to nothing; for his confirming their government, as it was e&s;tab|li&s;hed by law, could bind him no longer than while that legal e&s;tabli&s;hment was in force: So the rever&s;ing of that would re|lea&s;e the King. This allayed the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI>'s di&s;plea&s;ure a little. Yet <HI>Primero&s;e</HI> told me, he &s;poke often of it with great indignation, &s;ince it &s;eemed below the dignity of a King thus to equivocate with his people, and to deceive them. It &s;eemed, that <HI>Sharp</HI> thought it not enough to cheat the party him&s;elf, but would have the King &s;hare with him in the fraud. This was no honourable &s;tep to be made by a King, and to be contrived by a Clergyman. The letter was received with tran&s;ports of joy: The Pre&s;byterians reckoned they were &s;afe, and began to proceed &s;everely again&s;t the Prote&s;ters; to which they were &s;et on by &s;ome a&s;piring men, who hoped to merit by the heat expre&s;&s;ed on this occa&s;ion. And if <HI>Sharp</HI>'s impatience to get into the Archbi&s;hoprick of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> had not wrought too &s;trong on him, it would have given a great advantage to the re&s;ti|tution of Epi&s;copacy, if a General A&s;&s;embly had been called, and
<PB N="110" REF="125">
the two parties had been let loo&s;e on one another: That would have &s;hewn the impo&s;&s;ibility of maintaining the government of the Church in a parity, and the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;etting a &s;uperiour order over them for keeping them in unity and peace.</P>
<P>The King &s;ettled the Mini&s;try in <HI>Scotland.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Midle|toun</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Mini&s;try &s;ettled in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> was declared the King's Commi&s;&s;ioner for holding the Par|liament, and General of the forces that were to be rai&s;ed: The Earl of <HI>Glencairn</HI> was made Chancellour: The Earl of <HI>Lauder|dale</HI> was Secretary of State: The Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> Pre&s;ident of the Council: The Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> was continued in the Trea&s;ury: <HI>Primero&s;e</HI> was Clark Regi&s;ter, which is very like the place of Ma&s;ter of the Rolls in <HI>England.</HI> The re&s;t depended on the&s;e. But the Earls of <HI>Midletoun</HI> and <HI>Lauderdale</HI> were the two heads of the parties. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> had a private in&s;truction, which, as <HI>Lauderdale</HI> told me, was not communicated to him, to try the inclinations of the Nation for Epi&s;copacy, and to con&s;ider of the be&s;t method of &s;etting it up. This was drawn from the King by the Earl of <HI>Clarendon:</HI> For he him&s;elf was ob&s;erved to be very cold in it, while the&s;e things were doing. <HI>Primero&s;e</HI> got an order from the King to put up all the publick regi&s;ters of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which <HI>Cromwell</HI> had brought up, and lodged in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> as a pawn upon that Kingdom, in imitation of what King <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t was &s;aid to have done when he &s;ubdued that Nation. They were now put up in fifty hog&s;heds: And a &s;hip was ready to carry them down. But it was &s;ugge&s;ted to Lord <HI>Clarendon,</HI> that the original Covenant, &s;igned by the King, and &s;ome other declarations under his hand, were among them. And he, apprehending that at &s;ome time or other an ill u&s;e might have been made of the&s;e, would not &s;uffer them to be &s;hipped till they were vi&s;ited: Nor would he take <HI>Prime|ro&s;e</HI>'s promi&s;e of &s;earching for the&s;e carefully, and &s;ending them up to him. So he ordered a &s;earch to be made. None of the papers he looked for were found. But &s;o much time was lo&s;t, that the &s;ummer was &s;pent: So they were &s;ent down in winter: And by &s;ome ea&s;terly gu&s;ts the &s;hip was ca&s;t away near <HI>Berwick.</HI> So we lo&s;t all our records. And we have nothing now but &s;ome &s;ragments in private hands to rely on, having made at that time &s;o great a &s;hipwreck of all our authentick writings. This heightened the di&s;plea&s;ure the Nation had at the de&s;igns then on foot.</P>
<P>The main thing, upon which all other matters depended, was the method in which the affairs of <HI>Scotland</HI> were to be con|ducted. <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Council propo&s;ed to &s;it at $span$rt for <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> affairs.</NOTE> The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> moved, that there might be a Council &s;ettled to &s;it regularly at <HI>Whitehall</HI> on <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> affairs,
<PB N="111" REF="126">
to which every one of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Privy Council that happened to be on the place &s;hould be admitted: But with this addition, that, as two <HI>Scotch</HI> Lords were called to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Council, $o &s;ix of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were to be of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Council. The ef|fect of this would have been, that whereas the <HI>Scotch</HI> Coun&s;el|lours had no great force in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> affairs, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as they were men of great credit with the King, and were always on the place, would have the government of the affairs of <HI>Scotland</HI> wholly in their hands. This probably would have $aved that Nation from much inju&s;tice and violence, when there was a certain method of laying their grievances before the King: Complaints would have been heard, and matters well examined: <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> would not, and dur&s;t not, have given way to cry|ing oppre&s;&s;ion, and illegal proceedings: For tho' the&s;e matters did not fall under the cogni&s;ance of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament, yet it would have very much bla&s;ted a man's credit who &s;hould have concurred in &s;uch methods of government as were put in practice afterwards in that Kingdom: Therefore all people quickly &s;aw how wi&s;e a project this was, and how happy it would have proved, if affairs had &s;till gone in that channel. But the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> oppo&s;ed this with all his &s;trength. He told the King, it would quite de&s;troy the &s;cheme he had laid before him, which mu&s;t be managed &s;ecretly, and by men that were not in fear of the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> nor ob|noxious to it. He &s;aid to all <HI>Scotch-men,</HI> this would make <HI>Scot|land</HI> a province to <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ubject it to <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coun|&s;ellours, who knew neither the laws nor the intere&s;ts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and yet would determine every thing relating to it: And all the wealth of <HI>Scotland</HI> would be employed to bribe them, who, having no concern of their own in the affairs of that Kingdom, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of being turned by private con&s;idera|tions. To the Pre&s;byterians he &s;aid, this would infallibly bring in, not only Epi&s;copacy, but every thing el&s;e from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pattern. Men who had neither kindred nor e&s;tates in <HI>Scotland</HI> would be bia&s;&s;ed chiefly by that which was mo&s;t in vogue in <HI>England,</HI> without any regard to the inclinations of the <HI>Scots.</HI> The&s;e things made great impre&s;&s;ions on the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Nation. The King him&s;elf did not much like it. But the Earl of <HI>Cla|rendon</HI> told him, <HI>Scotland,</HI> by a &s;ecret and ill management, had begun the embroilment in his father's affairs, which could ne|ver have happened, if the affairs of that Kingdom had been under a more equal in&s;pection: If <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould again fall into new di&s;orders, he mu&s;t have the help of <HI>England</HI> to quiet them: And that could not be expected, if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had no &s;hare in
<PB N="112" REF="127">
the conduct of matters there. The King yielded to it: And this method was followed for two or three years; but was af|terwards broke by the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> when he got into the chief management. He began early to ob&s;erve &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s in the King at the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s po&s;itive way. He &s;aw the mi&s;tri&s;s hated him: And he believed &s;he would in time be too hard for him: Therefore he made great applications to her. But his conver&s;ation was too coar&s;e: And he had not money enough to &s;upport him&s;elf by pre&s;ents to her: So he could not be admitted into that cabal which was held in her lodgings. He &s;aw, that in a Council, where men of weight, who had much at &s;take in <HI>England,</HI> bore the chief &s;way, he dur&s;t not have propo&s;ed tho&s;e things, by which he intended to e&s;tabli&s;h his own intere&s;t with the King, and to govern that Kingdom which way his pride or pa&s;&s;ion might guide him. Among others, he took great pains to per&s;uade me of the great &s;ervice he had done his country by breaking that method of governing it; tho' we had many occa&s;ions afterwards to &s;ee how fatal that proved, and how wicked his de&s;ign in it was.</P>
<P>I have thus opened with &s;ome copiou&s;ne&s;s the beginnings of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Com|mittee of E&s;|tates meet in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> this reign; &s;ince, as they are little known, and I had them from the chief of both &s;ides, &s;o they may guide the reader to ob&s;erve the progre&s;s of things better in the &s;equel than he could otherwi&s;e do. In <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the Earl of <HI>Glencairn</HI> was &s;ent down to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had orders to call together the Committee of E&s;tates. This was a practice begun in the late times: When the Parliament made a rece&s;s, they appointed &s;ome of every State to &s;it, and to act as a Council of State in their name till the next &s;e&s;&s;ion; for which they were to prepare matters, and to which they gave an account of their proceedings. When the Parli|ament of <HI>Sterling</HI> was adjourned, the King being pre&s;ent, a Committee had been named: So, &s;uch of the&s;e as were yet alive were &s;ummoned to meet, and to &s;ee to the quiet of the Nation, till the Parliament &s;hould be brought together; which did not meet before <HI>January.</HI> On the day in which the Committee met, ten or twelve of the Prote&s;ting Mini&s;ters met likewi&s;e at <HI>E|denburgh,</HI> and had before them a warm paper prepared by one <HI>Guthery,</HI> one of the violente&s;t Mini&s;ters of the whole party. In it, after &s;ome cold compliment to the King upon his Re&s;torati|on, they put him in mind of the Covenant which he had &s;o &s;o|lemnly &s;worn while among them: They lamented that, in&s;tead of pur&s;uing the ends of it in <HI>England,</HI> as he had &s;worn to do, he had &s;et up the Common Prayer in his Chappel, and the or|der of Bi&s;hops: Upon which they made terrible denunciations
<PB N="113" REF="128">
of heavy judgments from God on him, if he did not &s;tand to the Covenant, which they called the oath of God. The Earl of <HI>Glencairn</HI> had notice of this meeting: And he &s;ent and &s;eiz|ed on them together with this remon&s;trance. The paper was voted &s;candalous and &s;editious: And the Mini&s;ters were all clapt up in pri&s;on, and were threaten'd with great &s;everities. <HI>Guthery</HI> was kept &s;till in pri&s;on, who had brought the others together: But the re&s;t after a while's impri&s;onment were let go. <HI>Guthery,</HI> being Mini&s;ter of <HI>Sterlin</HI> while the King was there, had let fly at him in his Sermons in a mo&s;t indecent manner; which at la&s;t became &s;o intolerable, that he was cited to appear before the King to an&s;wer for &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in his &s;ermons: He would not appear, but declined the King and his Council, who, he &s;aid, were not proper judges of matters of doctrine, for which he was only accountable to the judicatories of the Kirk. He al|&s;o prote&s;ted for remedy of law again&s;t the King, for thus di|&s;turbing him in the exerci&s;e of his Mini&s;try. This per&s;onal affront had irritated the King more again&s;t him, than again&s;t any other of the party. And it was re&s;olved to &s;trike a terrour into them all, by making an example of him. He was a man of courage, and went thro' all his trouble with great firmne&s;s. But this way of proceeding &s;truck the whole party with &s;uch a con&s;ternation, that it had all the effect which was de&s;igned by it: For whereas the pulpits had, to the great &s;candal of religi|on, been places where the preachers had for many years vent|ed their &s;pleen and arraigned all proceedings, they became now more decent, and there was a general &s;ilence every where with relation to the affairs of &s;tate: Only they could not hold from many &s;ly and &s;ecret in&s;inuations, as if the Ark of God was &s;hak|ing, and the Glory departing. A great many offenders were &s;ummoned, at the King's &s;uit, before the Committee of E&s;tates, and required to give bail, that they &s;hould appear at the open|ing of the Parliament, and an&s;wer to what &s;hould be then ob|jected to them. Many &s;aw, the de&s;ign of this was to fright them into a compo&s;ition, and al&s;o into a concurrence with the mea|&s;ures that were to be taken. For the greater part they compli|ed, and redeemed them&s;elves from farther vexation by &s;uch pre|&s;ents as they were able to make. And in the&s;e tran&s;actions <HI>Primero&s;e</HI> and <HI>Fletcher</HI> were the great dealers.</P>
<P>In the end of the year the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> came down with <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment in <HI>S$$$|land.</HI></NOTE> great magnificence: His way of living was the mo&s;t &s;plendid the nation had ever &s;een: But it was likewi&s;e the mo&s;t &s;candalous; for vices of all &s;orts were the open practices of tho&s;e about him. Drinking was the mo&s;t notorious of all, which was often
<PB N="114" REF="129">
continued thro' the whole night to the next morning: And many di&s;orders happening after tho&s;e irrregular heats, the people, who had never before that time &s;een any thing like it, came to look with an ill eye on every thing that was done by &s;uch a &s;et of lewd and vitious men. This laid in all men's minds a new prejudice again&s;t Epi&s;copacy: For they, who could not examine into the nature of things, were apt to take an ill opinion of e|very change in religion that was brought about by &s;uch bad in|&s;truments. There had been a face of gravity and piety in the former admini&s;tration, which made the libertinage of the pre|&s;ent time more odious.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> opened the Parliament on the fir&s;t of <HI>Ja|nuary</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1661.</NOTE> with a &s;peech &s;etting forth the ble&s;&s;ing of the Re&s;toration: He magnified the King's per&s;on, and enlarged on the affection that he bore to that his ancient Kingdom: He hoped they would make &s;uitable returns of zeal for the King's &s;ervice, that they would condemn all the inva&s;ions that had been made on the Re|gal authority, and a&s;&s;ert the ju&s;t prerogative of the Crown, and give &s;upplies for keeping up &s;uch a force as was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;e|cure the publick peace, and to pre&s;erve them from the return of &s;uch calamities as they had &s;o long felt. The Parliament writ an an&s;wer to the King's letter full of duty and thanks. The fir&s;t thing propo&s;ed was to name Lords of the Articles. In order to the apprehending the importance of this, I will give &s;ome ac|count of the con&s;titution of that Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Parliament was anciently the King's Court, where all <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lords of the Arti|cles.</NOTE> who held land of him were bound to appear. All &s;ate in one hou&s;e, but were con&s;idered as three e&s;tates. The fir&s;t was the Church, repre&s;ented by the Bi&s;hops, and mitred Abbots, and Priors. The &s;econd was the Baronage, the Nobility and Gen|try who held their Baronies of the King. And the third was the Burroughs, who held of the King by Barony, tho' in a community. So that the Parliament was truly the Baronage of the Kingdom. The le&s;&s;er Barons grew weary of this atten|dance: So in King <HI>James</HI> the fir&s;t time (during the reign of <HI>Hen|ry</HI> IV. of <HI>England</HI> they were excu&s;ed from it, and were impower|ed to &s;end proxies, to an indefinite number, to repre&s;ent them in Parliament. Yet they neglected to do this. And it continued &s;o till King <HI>James</HI> the &s;ixth's time, in which the mitred Abbots being taken away, and few of the titular Bi&s;hops that were then continued appearing at them, the Church Lands being general|ly in Lay hands, the Nobility carried matters in Parliament as they plea&s;ed: And as they oppre&s;&s;ed the Burroughs, &s;o they had the King much under them. Upon this the lower Barons
<PB N="115" REF="130">
got them&s;elves to be re&s;tored to the right which they had neg|lected near two hundred years. They were allowed by act of Par|liament to &s;end two from a county: Only &s;ome &s;maller coun|ties &s;ent but one. This brought that con&s;titution to a truer balance. The lower Barons have a right to choo&s;e at their coun|ty Courts after <HI>Michaelmas</HI> their Commi&s;&s;ioners, to &s;erve in any Parliament that may be called within that year. And they who chu&s;e them &s;ign a commi&s;&s;ion to him who repre&s;ents them. So the Sheriff has no &s;hare of the return. And in the ca&s;e of con|troverted elections the Parliament examines the commi&s;&s;ions, to &s;ee who has the greate&s;t number, and judges whether every one that &s;igns it had a right to do &s;o. The Burroughs only choo&s;e their members when the &s;ummons goes out: And all are cho&s;en by the men of the corporation, or, as they call them, the town council. All the&s;e E&s;tates &s;it in one hou&s;e, and vote together. Anciently the Parliament &s;ate only two days, the fir&s;t and the la&s;t. On the fir&s;t they cho&s;e tho&s;e who were to &s;it on the articles, eight for every &s;tate, to whom the King joined eight officers of &s;tate. The&s;e received all the heads of grievances or articles that were brought to them, and formed them into bills as they plea&s;|ed: And on the la&s;t day of the Parliament, the&s;e were all read, and were approved or rejected by the whole body. So they were a committee that had a very extraordinary authority, &s;ince nothing could be brought before the Parliament but as they plea&s;ed. This was pretended to be done only for the &s;hortening and di&s;patching of Se&s;&s;ions. The Crown was not contented with this limitation, but got it to be carried farther. The No|bility came to choo&s;e eight Bi&s;hops, and the Bi&s;hops to choo&s;e eight noble men: And the&s;e &s;ixteen choo&s;e the eight Barons, (&s;o the repre&s;entative for the Shires are called,) and the eight Bur|ge&s;&s;es. By this means our Kings did upon the matter choo&s;e all the Lords of the articles. So entirely had they got the liberties of that Parliament into their hands.</P>
<P>During the late troubles they had &s;till kept up a di&s;tinction of three e&s;tates, the le&s;&s;er Barons making one: And then every E&s;tate might meet apart, and name their own committee: But &s;till all things were brought in, and debated in full Parliament. So now the fir&s;t thing propo&s;ed was, the returning to the old cu&s;tom of naming Lords of the articles. The Earl of <HI>Tweedale</HI> oppo&s;ed it, but was &s;econded only by one per&s;on. So it pa&s;s'd with that &s;mall oppo&s;ition. Only, to make it go ea&s;ier, it was promi&s;ed, that there &s;hould be frequent &s;e&s;&s;ions of Parliament, and that the acts &s;hould not be brought in in a hurry, and carried with the ha&s;te that had been practi&s;ed in former times.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="131">
The Parliament granted the King an additional revenue for life of 40000 <HI>l.</HI> a year, to be rai&s;ed by an exci&s;e on beer and ale, for maintaining a &s;mall force: Upon which two troops and a regi|ment <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Acts pa&s;s'd in this &s;e&s;&s;ion.</NOTE> of foot guards were to be rai&s;ed. They ordered the Mar|qui&s;s of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI>'s quarters to be brought together: And they were buried with great &s;tate. They fell next upon the acts of the former times that had limited the Prerogative: They re|pealed them, and a&s;&s;erted it with a full extent in a mo&s;t extra|ordinary manner. <HI>Primero&s;e</HI> had the drawing of the&s;e acts. He often confe&s;&s;ed to me, that he thought he was as one bewitched while he drew them: For, not con&s;idering the ill u&s;e might be made of them afterwards, he drew them with preambles full of extravagant rhetorick, reflecting &s;everely on the proceedings of the late times, and &s;welled them up with the highe&s;t phra|&s;es and fulle&s;t clau&s;es that he could invent. In the act which a&s;&s;erted the King's power of the militia, the power of arming and levying the &s;ubjects was carried &s;o far, that it would have ruined the Kingdom, if <HI>Gilmore,</HI> (an eminent Lawyer, and a man of great integrity, who had now the more credit, for he had always favoured the King's &s;ide,) had not ob&s;erved that, as the act was worded, the King might require all the &s;ubjects to &s;erve at their own charge, and might oblige them, in order to the redeeming them&s;elves from &s;erving, to pay whatever might be &s;et on them. So he made &s;uch an oppo&s;ition to this, that it could not pa&s;s till a provi&s;o was added to it, that the Kingdom &s;hould not be obliged to maintain any force levied by the King, otherwi&s;e than as it &s;hould be agreed to in Parliament, or in a Convention of E&s;tates. This was the only thing that was then looked to: For all the other acts pa&s;s'd in the articles as <HI>Prime|ro&s;e</HI> had penn'd them. They were brought into Parliament: And upon one ha&s;ty reading them they were put to the vote, and were always carried.</P>
<P>One act troubled the Pre&s;byterians extreamly. In the act a&s;|&s;erting the King's power in treaties of peace and war, all leagues with any other Nation, not made by the King's authority, were declared trea&s;onable: And in con&s;equence of this the League and Covenant made with <HI>England</HI> in the year 1643 was condemned, and declared of no force for the future. This was the idol of all the Pre&s;byterians: So they were much alarmed at it. But <HI>Sharp</HI> re&s;trained all tho&s;e with whom he had credit: He told them, the only way to pre&s;erve their government was, to let all that related to the King's authority be &s;eparated from it, and be condemned, that &s;o they might be no more accu&s;ed as enemies to monarchy, or as leavened with the principles of rebellion.
<PB N="117" REF="132">
He told them, they mu&s;t be contented to let that pa&s;s, that the jealou&s;y which the King had of them, as enemies to his prerogative, might be extingui&s;hed in the mo&s;t effectual man|ner. This re&s;trained many. But &s;ome hotter zealots could not be governed. One <HI>Macquair,</HI> a hot man and con&s;iderably learned, did in his church at <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> openly prote&s;t again&s;t this act, as contrary to the oath of God, and &s;o void of it&s;elf. To prote&s;t again&s;t an act of Parliament was trea&s;on by their law. And <HI>Midletoun</HI> was re&s;olved to make an example of him for the terrifying others. But <HI>Macquair</HI> was as &s;tiff as he was &s;evere, and would come to no &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Yet he was only condemned to perpetual bani&s;hment. Upon which he, and &s;ome others who were afterwards bani&s;hed, went and &s;ettled at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> where they formed them&s;elves into a Pre&s;bytery, and writ many &s;edi|tious books, and kept a corre&s;pondence over all <HI>Scotland,</HI> that being the chief &s;eat of the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> trade: And by that means they did much more mi&s;chief to the government, than they could have done had they continued &s;till in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The Lords of the articles grew weary of preparing &s;o many <NOTE PLACE="marg">A$span$ct $span$ &s;ci$span$ding Parliame$span$ held &s;ince the year 1633.</NOTE> acts as the practices of the former times gave occa&s;ion for; but did not know how to meddle with tho&s;e acts that the late King had pa&s;&s;ed in the year 41, or the pre&s;ent King had pa&s;&s;ed while he was in <HI>Scotland.</HI> They &s;aw, that, if they &s;hould pro|ceed to repeal tho&s;e by which Pre&s;byterian government was ra|tified, that would rai&s;e much oppo&s;ition, and bring petitions from all that were for that government over the whole King|dom; which <HI>Midletoun</HI> and <HI>Sharp</HI> endeavoured to prevent, that the King might be confirmed in what they had affirmed, that the general bent of the Nation was now turned again&s;t Pre&s;|bytery and for Bi&s;hops. So <HI>Primero&s;e</HI> propo&s;ed, but half in je&s;t as he a&s;&s;ured me, that the better and &s;horter way would be to pa&s;s a general act re&s;ci&s;&s;ory, (as it was called,) annulling all the Parliaments that had been held &s;ince the year 1633, during the whole time of the war, as faulty and defective in their con|&s;titution. But it was not &s;o ea&s;y to know upon what point that defect was to be fixed. The only colourable pretence in law was, that, &s;ince the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate was not repre&s;ented in tho&s;e Parliaments, they were not a full repre&s;entative of the Kingdom, and &s;o not true Parliaments. But this could not be alledged by this pre&s;ent Parliament, which had no Bi&s;hops in it: If that inferred a nullity, this was no Parliament. Therefore they could only fix the nullity upon the pretence of force and violence. Yet it was a great &s;train to in&s;i&s;t on that, &s;ince it was vi&s;ible that neither the late King nor the pre&s;ent were under any force when they
<PB N="118" REF="133">
pa&s;&s;ed them: They came of their own accord, and pa&s;s'd tho&s;e acts. If it was in&s;i&s;ted on, that the ill &s;tate of their affairs was in the nature of a force, the ill con&s;equences of this were vi&s;ible; &s;ince no Prince by this means could be bound to any treaty, or be concluded by any law that limited his power, the&s;e being al|ways drawn from them by the nece&s;&s;ity of their affairs, which can never be called a force, as long as their per&s;ons are free. So, upon &s;ome debate about it on tho&s;e grounds, at a private juncto the propo&s;ition, tho' well liked, was let fall, as not ca|pable to have good colours put upon it: Nor had the Earl of <HI>Middletoun</HI> any in&s;truction to warrant his pa&s;&s;ing any &s;uch act. Yet within a day or two, when they had drunk higher, they re&s;olved to venture on it. <HI>Primero&s;e</HI> was then ill. So one was &s;ent to him to de&s;ire him to prepare a bill to that effect. He &s;et about it: But perceived it was &s;o ill grounded, and &s;o wild in all the frame of it, that he thought, when it came to be better con&s;idered, it mu&s;t certainly be laid a&s;ide. But it fell out other|wi&s;e: His draught was copied out next morning, without alter|ing a word in it, and carried to the articles, and from thence to the Parliament, where it met indeed with great oppo&s;ition. The Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> argued much again&s;t it. The Parliament in the year 41 was legally &s;um|moned: The late King came thither in per&s;on with his ordi|nary attendance, and without the appearance of any force: If any acts then pa&s;s'd needed to be reviewed, that might be well done: But to annul a Parliament was a terrible precedent, which de&s;troyed the whole &s;ecurity of government: Another Parliament might annul the pre&s;ent Parliament, as well as that which was now propo&s;ed to be done: So no &s;top could be made, nor any &s;ecurity laid down for fixing things for the future: The Par|liament in the year 48 proceeded upon in&s;tructions under the King's own hand, which was all that could be had con&s;idering his impri&s;onment: They had declared for the King, and rai|&s;ed an army for his pre&s;ervation. To this the Earl of <HI>Midletoun,</HI> who contrary to cu&s;tom managed the debate him&s;elf, an&s;wered, that tho' there was no vi&s;ible force on the late King in the year 41, yet they all knew he was under a real force by rea&s;on of the rebellion that had been in this Kingdom, and the apparent danger of one ready to break out in <HI>England,</HI> which forced him to &s;ettle <HI>Scotland</HI> on &s;uch terms as he could bring them to: So that di&s;tre&s;s on his affairs was really equivalent to a force on his per&s;on: Yet he confe&s;&s;ed, it was ju&s;t, that &s;uch an appearance of a Parliament &s;hould be a full authority to all who acted under it: And care was taken to &s;ecure the&s;e by a provi&s;o that was put
<PB N="119" REF="134">
in the act to indemnify them: He acknowledged the de&s;ign of the Parliament in the year 48 was good: Yet they declared for the King in &s;uch terms, and had acted &s;o hypocritically in order to the gaining of the Kirk party, that it was ju&s;t to con|demn the proceedings, tho' the intentions of many were honour|able and loyal: For we went into it, he &s;aid, as knaves, and therefore no wonder if we mi&s;carried in it as fools. This was very ill taken by all who had been concerned in it. The bill was put to the vote, and carried by a great majority: And the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> immediately pa&s;s'd it without &s;taying for an in&s;truction from the King. The excu&s;e he made for it was, that, &s;ince the King had by his letter to the Presbyterians con|firmed their government as it was e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, there was no way left to get out of that, but the annulling all tho&s;e laws.</P>
<P>This was a mo&s;t extravagant act, and only fit to be conclu|ded <NOTE PLACE="marg">It was not liked by the King.</NOTE> after a drunken bout. It &s;hook all po&s;&s;ible &s;ecurity for the future, and laid down a mo&s;t pernicious precedent. The Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> aggravated this heavily to the King. It &s;hewed, that the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> under&s;tood not the fir&s;t principles of go|vernment, &s;ince he had, without any warrant for it, given the King's a&s;&s;ent to a law that mu&s;t for ever take away all the &s;e|curity that law can give: No government was &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, as not to be liable to a revolution: This would cut off all hopes of peace and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, if any di&s;order &s;hould happen at any time thereafter. And &s;ince the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> had &s;et it up for a maxim never to be violated, that acts of indem|nity were &s;acred things, he &s;tudied to po&s;&s;e&s;s him again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Midletoun,</HI> who had now annulled the very Parliaments in which two King's had pa&s;s'd acts of indemnity. This rai|&s;ed a great clamour. And upon that the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> com|plained in Parliament, that their be&s;t &s;ervices were repre&s;ented to the King as blemi&s;hes on his honour, and as a prejudice to his affairs: So he de&s;ired they would &s;end up &s;ome of the mo&s;t emi|nent of their body to give the King a true account of their pro|ceedings. The Earls of <HI>Glencairn</HI> and <HI>Rothes</HI> were &s;ent: For the Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> gave &s;ecret engagements to both &s;ides, re&s;olv|ing to &s;trike into that to which he &s;aw the King mo&s;t inclin|ed. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI>'s de&s;ign was to accu&s;e the Earl of <HI>Lau|derdale</HI> of mi&s;repre&s;enting the proceedings of Parliament, and of belying the King's good &s;ubjects, called in the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> law Lea|&s;ing making, which either to the King of the People or to the People of the King is capital.</P>
<P><HI>Sharp</HI> went up with the&s;e Lords to pre&s;s the &s;peedy &s;etting up <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Presby|terians in great di&s;or|der.</NOTE> of Epi&s;copacy, now that the greate&s;t enemies of that government
<PB N="120" REF="135">
were under a general con&s;ternation, and were upon other ac|counts &s;o obnoxious that they dur&s;t not make any oppo&s;ition to it, &s;ince no act of indemnity was yet pa&s;s'd. He had expre&s;&s;ed a great concern to his old brethren, when the act re&s;ci&s;&s;ory pa&s;s'd, and acted that part very &s;olemnly for &s;ome days: Yet he &s;eemed to take heart again, and per&s;uaded the mini&s;ters of that party, that it would be a &s;ervice to them, &s;ince now the ca&s;e of ratifying their government was &s;eparated from the rebellion of the late times: So that hereafter it was to &s;ub&s;i&s;t by a law pa&s;s'd in a Parliament that &s;ate and acted in full freedom. So he undertook to go again to Court, and to move for an in&s;truction to &s;ettle Pre&s;bytery on a new and undi&s;puted bottom. The poor men were &s;o &s;truck with the ill &s;tate of their affairs, that they either tru&s;ted him, or at lea&s;t &s;eemed to do it; for indeed they had neither &s;en&s;e nor courage left them. During the &s;e&s;|&s;ion of Parliament the mo&s;t a&s;piring men of the Clergy were pickt out to preach before the Parliament. They did not &s;peak out: But they all in&s;inuated the nece&s;&s;ity of a greater authority than was then in the Church, for keeping them in order. One or two &s;poke plainer: Upon which the Pre&s;bytery of <HI>Edenburgh</HI> went to the Earl of <HI>Midletoun,</HI> and complained of that, as an affront to the law and to the King's letter. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with good words, but took no notice of their complaint. The Synods in &s;everal places re&s;olved to prepare addre&s;&s;es both to King and Parliament, for an act e&s;tabli&s;hing their government. And <HI>Sharp</HI> di&s;&s;embled &s;o artificially, that he met with tho&s;e who were preparing an addre&s;s to be pre&s;ented to the Synod of <HI>Fi&s;e,</HI> that was to &s;it within a week after: And heads were agreed on. <HI>Honyman,</HI> afterwards Bi&s;hop of <HI>Orkney,</HI> drew it up with &s;o much vehemence, that <HI>Wood,</HI> their Divinity Profe&s;&s;or, told me, he and &s;ome others &s;ate up almo&s;t the whole night before the Synod met, to draw it over again in a &s;moother &s;train. But <HI>Sharp</HI> gave the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> notice of this. So the Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> was &s;ent over to &s;ee to their behaviour. As &s;oon as the Mini&s;ters entred upon that &s;ubject, he in the King's name di&s;&s;olved the Synod, and commanded the Mini&s;ters under pain of trea&s;on to retire to their &s;everal habitations. Such care was taken that no publick application &s;hould be made in favour of Pre&s;bytery. Any attempt that was made on the other hand met with great encouragement. The Synod of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> was the only body that made an addre&s;s looking towards Epi&s;copacy. In a long preamble they reflected on the confu&s;ions and vio|lence of the late times, of which they enumerated many parti|culars: And they concluded with a prayer, that &s;ince the legal
<PB N="121" REF="136">
authority upon which their Courts proceeded was now annulled, that therefore the King and Parliament would &s;ettle their go|vernment, conform to the Scriptures and the rules of the pri|mitive Church. The Pre&s;byterians &s;aw what was driven at, and how their words would be under&s;tood: But I heard one of them &s;ay, (for I was pre&s;ent at that meeting,) that no man could de|cently oppo&s;e tho&s;e words, &s;ince by that he would in&s;inuate that he thought Pre&s;bytery was not conform to the&s;e.</P>
<P>In this &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament another act pa&s;s'd, which was a new affliction to all the party: The twenty ninth of <HI>May</HI> was appointed to be kept as a holy day; &s;ince on that day an end had been put to three and twenty year's cour&s;e of rebellion, of which the whole progre&s;s was reckoned up in the highe&s;t &s;train of <HI>Primero&s;e</HI>'s eloquence. The Mini&s;ters &s;aw, that by ob&s;erving this act pa&s;s'd with &s;uch a preamble, they condemned all their former proceedings, as rebellious and hypocritical. They &s;aw, that by obeying it they would lo&s;e all their credit, and contra|dict all they had been building up in a cour&s;e of &s;o many years. Yet &s;uch was the heat of that time, that they dur&s;t not except to it on that account. So they laid hold on the &s;ubtilty of a holy day; and covered them&s;elves under that controver&s;y, de|nying it was in the power of any human authority to make a day holy. But withal they fell upon a poor &s;hift: They enac|ted in their &s;everal Pre&s;byteries that they &s;hould ob&s;erve that day as a thank&s;giving for the King's Re&s;toration: So they took no notice of the act of Parliament, but ob&s;erved it in obedience to their own act. But this, tho' it covered them from pro&s;ecuti|on, &s;ince the law was obeyed, yet it laid them open to much contempt. When the Earls of <HI>Glencairn</HI> and <HI>Rothes</HI> came to Court, the King was &s;oon &s;atisfied with the account they gave of the proceedings of Parliament: And the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> would not own that he had ever mi&s;repre&s;ented them. They were ordered to proceed in their charging of him, as the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> &s;hould direct them. But he told them the a&s;&s;ault|ing of a Mini&s;ter, as long as he had an intere&s;t in the King, was a practice that never could be approved: It was one of the unea&s;y things that a Hou&s;e of Commons of <HI>England</HI> &s;ometimes ventured on, which was ungrateful to the Court: Such an at|tempt, in&s;tead of &s;haking the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> would give him a fa&s;ter root with the King. They mu&s;t therefore content them&s;elves with letting the King &s;ee how well his &s;ervice went on in their hands, and how unju&s;tly they had been mi&s;repre|&s;ented to him: And thus by degrees they would gain their point, and the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> would become u&s;ele&s;s to the King.
<PB N="122" REF="137">
So this de&s;ign was let fall. But the Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> a&s;&s;ured <HI>Lauder|dale,</HI> he had diverted the &s;torm: Tho' <HI>Primero&s;e</HI> told me, this was the true ground on which they proceeded. They became all friends, as to outward appearance.</P>
<P>Thus I have gone thro' the actings of the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of this Parliament with relation to publick affairs. It was a mad roar|ing time, full of extravagance. And no wonder it was &s;o, when the men of affairs were almo&s;t perpetually drunk. I &s;hall in the next place give an account of the attainders pa&s;s'd in it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and chief of the&s;e was of the Marquis of <HI>Argile.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Argile</HI>'s at|tainder.</NOTE> He was indicted at the King's &s;uit for a great many facts, that were reduced to three heads. The fir&s;t was of his publick act|ings during the wars, of which many in&s;tances were given; &s;uch as his being concerned in the delivering up of the King to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> his oppo&s;ing the engagement in the year 1648, and his heading the ri&s;ing in the <HI>We&s;t</HI> in oppo&s;ition to the Committee of E&s;tates: In this, and many other &s;teps made during the war, he was e&s;teemed the principal actor, and &s;o ought to be made the greate&s;t example for terrifying others. The &s;e|cond head con&s;i&s;ted of many murders, and other barbarities, committed by his officers, during the war, on many of the King's party; chiefly on tho&s;e who had &s;erved under the Mar|qui&s;s of <HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> many of them being murdered in cold blood. The third head con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ome articles of his concurrence with <HI>Cromwell</HI> and the u&s;urpers, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e who appeared for the King in the <HI>Highlands,</HI> his being one of his Parliament, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting in proclaiming him Protector, with a great many other particulars, into which his compliance was branched out. He had coun&s;el a&s;&s;igned him, who performed their part very well.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of his defence was, that during the late wars he was but one among a great many more: He had always acted by authority of Parliament, and according to the in&s;tructions that were given him, as oft as he was &s;ent on any expedition or nego|tiation. As to all things done before the year 1641, the late King had buried them in an act of oblivion then pa&s;&s;ed, as the pre|&s;ent King had al&s;o done in the year 1651: So he did not think he was bound to an&s;wer to any particular before that time. For the &s;econd head, he was at <HI>London</HI> when mo&s;t of the barbari|ties &s;et out in it were committed: Nor did it appear that he gave any orders about them. It was well known that great outrages had been committed by the <HI>Macdonalds:</HI> And he believed his people, when they had the better of them, had taken cruel re|venges: This was to be imputed to the heat of the time, and
<PB N="123" REF="138">
to the tempers of the people, who had been much provoked by the burning of his whole countrey, and by much blood that was &s;hed. And as to many &s;tories laid to the charge of his men, he knew &s;ome of them were mere forgeries, and others were ag|gravated much beyond the truth: But, what truth &s;oever might be in them, he could not be an&s;werable but for what was done by him&s;elf, or by his orders. As to the third head, of his com|pliance with the u&s;urpation, he had &s;tood out till the nation was quite conquered: And in that ca&s;e it was the received opini|on both of divines and lawyers, that men might lawfully &s;ub|mit to an u&s;urpation, when forced to it by an inevitable nece&s;|&s;ity. It was the epidemical &s;in of the nation. His circum&s;tan|ces were &s;uch, that more than a bare compliance was required of him. What he did that way was only to pre&s;erve him&s;elf and his family, and was not done on de&s;ign to oppo&s;e the King's intere&s;t. Nor did his &s;ervice &s;uffer by any thing he did. This was the &s;ub&s;tance of his defence in a long &s;peech, which he made with &s;o good a grace and &s;o &s;kilfully, that his character was as much rai&s;ed as his family &s;uffered by the pro&s;ecution. In one &s;peech, excu&s;ing his compliance with <HI>Cromwell,</HI> he &s;aid, what could he think of that matter, after a man &s;o eminent in the law as his Maje&s;ty's Advocate had taken the engagement? This inflamed the other &s;o much, that he called him an impu|dent villain, and was not &s;o much as chid for that barbarous treatment. Lord <HI>Argile</HI> gravely &s;aid, he had learned in his af|fliction to bear reproaches; but if the Parliament &s;aw no cau&s;e to condemn him, he was le&s;s concerned at the King's Advocate's railing. The King's Advocate put in an additional article, of charging him with acce&s;&s;ion to the King's death, for which all the proof he offered lay in a pre&s;umption: <HI>Cromwell</HI> had come down to <HI>Scotland</HI> with his army in <HI>September</HI> 1648, and at that time he had many and long conferences with <HI>Argile;</HI> and im|mediately upon his return to <HI>London</HI> the treaty with the King was broken off, and the King was brought to his trial: The advo|cate from thence inferred, that it was to be pre&s;umed that <HI>Cromwell</HI> and <HI>Argile</HI> had concerted that matter between them. While this proce&s;s was carried on, which was the &s;olemne&s;t that ever was in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Lord <HI>Lorn</HI> continued at Court &s;oliciting for his father; and obtained a letter to be writ by the King to the Earl of <HI>Midletoun,</HI> requiring him to order his Advocate not to in&s;i&s;t on any publick proceedings before the indemnity he him&s;elf had pa&s;s'd in the year 1651. He al&s;o required him, when the trial was ended, to &s;end up the whole proce&s;s, and lay it before the King, before the Parliament &s;hould give &s;entence. The Earl
<PB N="124" REF="139">
of <HI>Midletoun</HI> &s;ubmitted to the fir&s;t part of this: So all farther enquiry into tho&s;e matters was &s;uper&s;eded. But as to the &s;econd part of the letter, it looked &s;o like a di&s;tru&s;t of the ju&s;tice of the Parliament, that he &s;aid, he dur&s;t not let it be known, till he had a &s;econd and more po&s;itive order, which he earne&s;tly de&s;ired might not be &s;ent; for it would very much di&s;courage this loyal and affectionate Parliament: And he begged earne&s;tly to have that order recalled; which was done. For &s;ome time there was a &s;top to the proceedings, in which Lord <HI>Argile</HI> was contriving an e&s;cape out of the Ca&s;tle. He kept his bed for &s;ome days: And his Lady being of the &s;ame &s;tature with him&s;elf, and coming to him in a chair, he had put on her cloaths, and was going into the chair: But he apprehended he &s;hould be di&s;co|vered, and his execution ha&s;tened; and &s;o his heart failed him. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to have the King's death fa&s;tened on him. By this means, as he would die with the more infamy, &s;o he reckoned this would put an end to the family, &s;ince no body dur&s;t move in favour of the &s;on of one judged guilty of that crime. And he, as was believed, hoped to obtain a grant of his e&s;tate. Search was made into all the precedents of men who had been at any time condemned upon pre&s;umption. And the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> re&s;olved to argue the matter him&s;elf, hoping that the weight of his authority would bear down all oppo&s;ition. He managed it indeed with more force than decency: He was too vehement, and maintained the argu|ment with a &s;trength that did more honour to his parts than to his ju&s;tice or his character. But <HI>Gilmore,</HI> tho' newly made Pre&s;i|dent of the Se&s;&s;ion, which is the &s;upream Court of Ju&s;tice in that Kingdom, abhorred the precedent of attainting a man up|on &s;o remote a pre&s;umption; and looked upon it as le&s;s ju&s;tifia|ble than the much decried attainder of the Earl of <HI>Strafford.</HI> So he undertook the argument again&s;t <HI>Midletoun:</HI> They repli|ed upon one another thirteen or fourteen times in a debate that la&s;ted many hours. <HI>Gilmore</HI> had &s;o clearly the better of the ar|gument, that, tho' the Parliament was &s;o &s;et again&s;t <HI>Argile</HI> that every thing was like to pa&s;s that might blacken him, yet, when it was put to the vote, he was acquitted as to that by a great majority: At which he expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much joy, that he &s;eemed little concerned at any thing that could happen to him after that. All that remained was to make his compliance with the u&s;urp|ers appear to be trea&s;on. The debate was like to have la&s;ted long. The Earl of <HI>Lowdun,</HI> who had been Lord Chancellour, and was counted the eloquente&s;t man of that time, for he had a copiou&s;ne&s;s in &s;peaking that was never exhau&s;ted, (he was
<PB N="125" REF="140">
come of his family and was his particular friend,) had prepar|ed a long and learned argument on that head. He had ga|thered the opinions both of divines and lawyers, and had laid together a great deal out of hi&s;tory, more particularly out of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> hi&s;tory, to &s;hew that it had never been cen&s;ured as a crime: But that on the contrary in all their confu&s;ions the men, who had merited the mo&s;t of the Crown in all its &s;ha|kings, were per&s;ons who had got credit by compliance with the &s;ide that prevailed, and by that means had brought things about again. But, while it was very doubtful how it would have gone, <HI>Monk</HI> by an inexcu&s;able ba&s;ene&s;s had &s;earched among his letters, and found &s;ome that were writ by <HI>Argile</HI> to him&s;elf, that were hearty and zealous on their &s;ide. The&s;e he &s;ent down to <HI>Scot|land.</HI> And after they were read in Parliament, it could not be pretended that his compliance was feigned, or extorted from him. Every body blamed <HI>Monk</HI> for &s;ending the&s;e down, &s;ince it was a betraying the confidence that they then lived in. They were &s;ent by an expre&s;s, and came to the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> af|ter the Parliament was engaged in the debate. So he ordered the letters to be read. This was much blamed, as contrary to the forms of ju&s;tice, &s;ince probation was clo&s;ed on both &s;ides. But the reading of them &s;ilenced all farther debate. All his friends went out: And he was condemned as guilty of trea&s;on. The Marquis of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> only refu&s;ed to vote. He owned, he had too much re&s;entment to judge in that matter. It was de|&s;igned he &s;hould be hanged, as the Marquis of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI> had been: But it was carried that he &s;hould be beheaded, and that his head &s;hould be &s;et up where Lord <HI>Montro&s;e</HI>'s had been &s;et. He received his &s;entence decently, and compo&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>The day before his death he wrote to the King, ju&s;tifying <NOTE PLACE="marg">And execu|tion.</NOTE> his intentions in all he had acted in the matter of the Cove|nant: He prote&s;ted his innocence, as to the death of the late King: He &s;ubmitted patiently to his &s;entence, and wi&s;hed the King a long and happy reign: He ca&s;t his family and children upon his mercy; and prayed that they might not &s;uffer for their father's fault. On the twenty &s;eventh of <HI>May,</HI> the day ap|pointed for his execution, he came to the &s;caffold in a very &s;o|lemn but undaunted manner, accompanied with many of the Nobility and &s;ome Mini&s;ters. He &s;poke for half an hour with a great appearance of &s;erenity. <HI>Cunningham</HI> his phy&s;ician told me he touched his pul&s;e, and that it did then beat at the u&s;ual rate, calm and &s;trong. He did in a mo&s;t &s;olemn manner vin|dicate him&s;elf from all knowledge or acce&s;&s;ion to the King's
<PB N="126" REF="141">
death: He pardoned all his enemies; and &s;ubmitted to the &s;en|tence, as to the will of God: He &s;poke highly in ju&s;tification of the Covenant, calling it the cau&s;e and work of God; and expre&s;&s;ed his apprehen&s;ion of &s;ad times like to follow; and exhorted all people to adhere to the Covenant, and to re&s;olve to &s;uffer ra|ther than &s;in again&s;t their con&s;ciences. He parted with all his friends very decently. And after &s;ome time &s;pent in his private devotions he was beheaded.</P>
<P>A few days after <HI>Guthry</HI> &s;uffered. He was accu&s;ed of acce&s;|&s;ion <NOTE PLACE="marg">The execu|tion of <HI>Gu|thry</HI> a Mini|&s;ter.</NOTE> to the remon&s;trance when the King was in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and for a book he had printed with the title <HI>of the cau&s;es of God's wrath upon the nation;</HI> in which the treating with the King, the tendring him the Covenant, and the admitting him to the exerci&s;e of the government, were highly aggravated, as great acts of apo&s;tacy. His declining the King's authority to judge of his &s;ermons, and his prote&s;ting for remedy of law again&s;t him, and the late &s;editious paper that he was drawing others to con|cur in, were the matters objected to him. He was a re&s;olute and &s;tiff man: So when his lawyers offered him legal defences, he would not be advi&s;ed by them, but re&s;olved to take his own way. He confe&s;&s;ed, and ju&s;tified all that he had done, as a|greeing to the principles and practices of the Kirk, who had a&s;|&s;erted all along that the doctrine delivered in their &s;ermons did not fall under the cogni&s;ance of the temporal Courts, till it was fir&s;t judged by the Church; for which he brought much tedi|ous proof. He &s;aid, his prote&s;ting for remedy of law again&s;t the King was not meant at the King's per&s;on, but was only with relation to co&s;ts and damages. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> had a per&s;onal animo&s;ity again&s;t him; for in the late times he had excommunicated him: So his eagerne&s;s in the pro&s;ecution did not look well. The defence he made &s;ignified nothing to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, but laid a great load on Pre&s;bytery; &s;ince he made it out beyond all di&s;pute, that he had acted upon their principles, which made them the more odious, as having among them &s;ome of the wor&s;t maxims of the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> that in particular, to make the pulpit a privileged place, in which a man might &s;afely vent trea&s;on, and be &s;ecure in doing it, if the Church ju|dicatory &s;hould agree to acquit him. So upon this occa&s;ion great advantage was taken, to &s;hew how near the &s;pirit that had reign|ed in Pre&s;bytery came up to Popery. It was re&s;olved to make a publick example of a Preacher: So he was &s;ingled out. He gave no advantage to tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to have &s;aved him by the lea&s;t &s;tep towards any &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, but much to the contra|ry. Yet, tho' all people were di&s;gu&s;ted at the Earl of <HI>Midle|toun</HI>'s
<PB N="127" REF="142">
eagerne&s;s in the pro&s;ecution, the Earl of <HI>Tweedale</HI> was the only man that moved again&s;t the putting him to death. He &s;aid, bani&s;hment had been hitherto the &s;evere&s;t cen&s;ure that had been laid on the Preachers for their opinions: He knew <HI>Guthry</HI> was a man apt to give per&s;onal provocation: And he wi&s;hed that might not have too great a &s;hare in carrying the matter &s;o far. Yet he was condemned to die. I &s;aw him &s;uffer. He was &s;o far from &s;hewing any fear, that he rather expre&s;&s;ed a contempt of death. He &s;poke an hour upon the ladder, with the compo&s;edne&s;s of a man that was delivering a &s;ermon rather than his la&s;t words. He ju&s;tified all he had done, and exhorted all people to adhere to the Covenant, which he magnified highly. With him one <HI>Gouan</HI> was al&s;o hanged, who had de&s;erted the army while the King was in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had gone over to <HI>Cromwell.</HI> The man was incon&s;iderable, till they made him more con&s;idered by putting him to death on &s;uch an account at &s;o great a di&s;tance of time.</P>
<P>The gro&s;s iniquity of the Court appeared in nothing more emi|nently <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some others were pro|ceeded a|gain&s;t.</NOTE> than in the favour &s;hewed <HI>Maccloud</HI> of <HI>A&s;&s;in,</HI> who had be|trayed the Marquis of <HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> and was brought over upon it. He in pri&s;on &s;truck up to a high pitch of vice and impiety, and gave great entertainments: And that, notwith&s;tanding the ba&s;ene&s;s of the man and of his crimes, begot him &s;o many friends, that he was let go without any cen&s;ure. The proceedings again&s;t <HI>Wari&s;ton</HI> were &s;oon di&s;patched, be being ab&s;ent. It was proved, that he had pre&s;ented the Remon&s;trance, that he had acted un|der <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s authority, and had &s;ate as a Peer in his Parliament, that he had confirmed him in his Protector&s;hip, and had like|wi&s;e &s;ate as one of the Committee of Safety: So he was attainted. <HI>Swintoun</HI> had been attainted in the Parliament at <HI>Sterlin</HI> for go|ing over to <HI>Cromwell:</HI> So he was brought before the Parliament to hear what he could &s;ay, why the &s;entence &s;hould not be exe|cuted. He was then become a Quaker; and did, with a &s;ort of eloquence that moved the whole hou&s;e, lay out all his own errours, and the ill &s;pirit he was in when he committed the things that were charged on him, with &s;o tender a &s;en&s;e, that he &s;eem|ed as one indifferent what they &s;hould do with him: And, with|out &s;o much as moving for mercy, or even for a delay, he did &s;o effectually prevail on them, that they recommended him to the King, as a fit object of his mercy. This was the more ea|&s;liy con$ented to by the Earl of <HI>Midletoun,</HI> in hatred to the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> who had got the gift of his e&s;tate. He had two great pleas to law: The one was, that the record of his attainder at <HI>Sterlin,</HI> with all that had pa&s;s'd in that Parliament, was lo&s;t: The
<PB N="128" REF="143">
other was, that by the act re&s;ci&s;&s;ory that Parliament being annulled, all that was done by it was void: But he urged neither, &s;ince there was matter enough to attaint him anew, if the defects of that &s;uppo&s;ed attainder had been ob&s;erved. So till the act of indemnity was pa&s;s'd he was &s;till in danger, having been the man of all <HI>Scotland</HI> that had been the mo&s;t tru&s;ted and employed by <HI>Cromwell:</HI> But upon pa&s;&s;ing the act of indemnity he was &s;afe.</P>
<P>The &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament was now brought to a conclu&s;ion, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Midletoun</HI> gave an ac|count of all that had pa&s;|&s;ed in Parli|ament to the King.</NOTE> without any motion for an act of indemnity. The &s;ecret of this was, that &s;ince Epi&s;copacy was to be &s;et up, and that tho&s;e who were mo&s;t like to oppo&s;e it were on other accounts obnoxious, it was thought be&s;t to keep them under that fear, till the change &s;hould be made. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> went up to Court full of merit, and as full of pride. He had a mind to be Lord Trea&s;urer; and told the King, that, if he intended to &s;et up E|pi&s;copacy, the Earl of <HI>Crawford,</HI> who was a noted Pre&s;byterian, mu&s;t be put out of that po&s;t: It was the opinion of the King's zeal for that form of government that mu&s;t bear down all the oppo&s;ition that might otherwi&s;e be made to it: And it would not be po&s;&s;ible to per&s;uade the nation of that, as long as they &s;aw the white &s;taff in &s;uch hands. Therefore, on the fir&s;t day on which a <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Council was called after he came up, he gave a long account of the proceedings of Parliament, and mag|nified the zeal and loyalty that many had expre&s;&s;ed, while o|thers that had been not only pardoned, but were highly tru&s;t|ed by the King, had been often cold and backward, and &s;ome|times plainly again&s;t the &s;ervice. The Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was ill that day: So the Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> undertook to an&s;wer this reflection, which he thought was meant of him&s;elf, for oppo&s;ing the act re&s;ci&s;&s;ory. He &s;aid, he had ob&s;erved &s;uch an entire una|nimity in carrying on the King's &s;ervice, that he did not know of any that had acted otherwi&s;e: And therefore he moved, that the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> might &s;peak plain, and name per&s;ons. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed: He did not intend to accu&s;e any: But yet he thought, he was bound to let the King know how he had been &s;erved. The Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> &s;till pre&s;s'd him to &s;peak out after &s;o general an accu&s;ation: No doubt, he would inform the King in private who the&s;e per&s;ons were: And &s;ince he had already gone &s;o far in publick, he thought he ought to go farther. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> was in &s;ome confu&s;ion; for he did not expect to be thus attack'd: So to get off he nam|ed the oppo&s;ition that the Earl of <HI>Tweedale</HI> had made to the &s;en|tence pa&s;s'd on <HI>Guthry,</HI> not without making indecent reflections on it, as if his pro&s;ecution had flowed from the King's re&s;ent|ments
<PB N="129" REF="144">
of his behaviour to him&s;elf: And &s;o he turned the matter, that the Earl of <HI>Tweedale</HI>'s reflection, which was thought indeed pointed again&s;t him&s;elf, &s;hould &s;eem as meant again&s;t the King. The Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> upon this &s;aid, that the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> ought to have excepted to the words when they were fir&s;t &s;pok|en; and no doubt the Parliament would have done the King ju|&s;tice: But it was never thought con&s;i&s;tent with the liberty of &s;peech in Parliament, to bring men into que&s;tion afterwards for words &s;poken in any debate, when they were not challenged as &s;oon as they were &s;poken. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> excu&s;ed him|&s;elf: He &s;aid, the thing was pa&s;s'd before he made due reflecti|ons on it; and &s;o a&s;ked pardon for that omi&s;&s;ion. The Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> was glad he him&s;elf had e&s;caped, and was &s;ilent as to the Earl of <HI>Tweedale</HI>'s concern: So, no body offering to excu&s;e him, an order was pre&s;ently &s;ent down for committing him to pri&s;on, and for examining him upon the words he had &s;poken, and on his meaning in them. That was not a time in which men dur&s;t pretend to privilege, or the freedom of debate: So he did not in&s;i&s;t on it; but &s;ent up &s;uch an account of his words, and &s;uch an explanation of them, as fully &s;atisfied the King. So after the impri&s;onment of &s;ome weeks he was &s;et at liberty. But this rai&s;|ed a great outcry again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Midletoun,</HI> as a thing that was contrary to the freedom of debate, and de&s;tructive of the liberty of Parliament. It lay the more open to cen&s;ure, becau&s;e the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> had accepted of a great entertainment from the Earl of <HI>Tweedale</HI> after <HI>Guthry</HI>'s bu&s;ine&s;s was over: And it &s;eemed contrary to the rules of ho&s;pitality, to have &s;uch a de&s;ign in his heart again&s;t a man in who&s;e hou&s;e he had been &s;o treat|ed: All the excu&s;e he made for it was, that he never intended it; but that the Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> had pre&s;s'd him &s;o hard upon the complaint he had made in general, that he had no way of get|ting out of it without naming &s;ome particulars; and he had no other ready then at hand.</P>
<P>Another difference of greater moment fell in between him and the Earl of <HI>Crawford.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> was now rai&s;ing the guards, that were to be paid out of the exci&s;e granted by the Par|liament. So he moved, that the exci&s;e might be rai&s;ed by col|lectors named by him&s;elf as General, that &s;o he might not depend on the Trea&s;ury for the pay of the forces. The Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> oppo&s;ed this with great advantage, &s;ince all revenues given the King did by the cour&s;e of law come into the Trea&s;ury. <HI>Scotland</HI> was not in a condition to maintain two Trea&s;urers: And, as to what was &s;aid, of the nece&s;&s;ity of having the pay of the army well a&s;certained and ever ready, otherwi&s;e it would become a grievance
<PB N="130" REF="145">
to the Kingdom, he &s;aid, the King was Ma&s;ter, and what orders &s;oever he thought fit to &s;end to the Trea&s;ury, they &s;hould be mo&s;t punctually obeyed. But the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> knew, there would be a great overplus of the exci&s;e beyond the pay of the troops: And he reckoned, that, if the collection was put in his hands, he would ea&s;ily get a grant of the overplus at the year's end. The Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> &s;aid, no &s;uch thing was ever pretended to by any General, unle&s;s by &s;uch as &s;et up to be independent, and who hop|ed by that means to make them&s;elves the ma&s;ters of the army. So he carried the point, which was thought a victory. And the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> was much blamed for putting his intere&s;t at Court on &s;uch an i&s;&s;ue, where the preten&s;ion was &s;o unu&s;ual and &s;o unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>The next point was concerning Lord <HI>Argile</HI>'s e&s;tate. The King was inclined to re&s;tore the Lord <HI>Lorn;</HI> tho' much pains was taken to per&s;uade him, that all the zeal he had expre&s;&s;ed in his &s;ervice was only an artifice between his father and him to pre&s;erve the family in all adventures: It was &s;aid, that had been an ordi|nary practice in <HI>Scotland</HI> for father and &s;on to put them&s;elves in different &s;ides. The Marquis of <HI>Argile</HI> had taken very extraordi|nary methods to rai&s;e his own family to &s;uch a &s;uperiority in the Highlands, that he was a &s;ort of a King among them. The Mar|quis of <HI>Huntly</HI> had married his &s;i&s;ter: And during their friend&s;hip <HI>Argile</HI> was bound with him for &s;ome of his debts. After that, the Marquis of <HI>Huntly,</HI> as he neglected his affairs, &s;o he engaged in the King's &s;ide, by which <HI>Argile</HI> &s;aw he mu&s;t be undone. So he pretended, that he only intended to &s;ecure him&s;elf, when he bought in prior mortgages and debts, which, as was believed, were compounded at very low rates. The friends of the Marquis of <HI>Huntly</HI>'s family pre&s;s'd the King hard to give his heirs the con|fi&s;cation of that part of <HI>Argile</HI>'s e&s;tate, in which the Marquis of <HI>Huntly</HI>'s debts, and all the preten&s;ion on his e&s;tate were compre|hended. And it was given to the Marquis of <HI>Huntly,</HI> now Duke of <HI>Gordon,</HI> then a young child: But no care was taken to breed him a Prote&s;tant. The Marquis of <HI>Montro&s;e,</HI> and all others who&s;e e&s;tates had been ruined under <HI>Angile</HI>'s conduct, expected likewi&s;e reparation out of his e&s;tate; which was a very great one, but in no way able to &s;atisfy all tho&s;e demands. And it was believed, that the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> him&s;elf hoped to have carried away the main bulk of it: So that both the Lord <HI>Lorn</HI> and he concurred, tho' with different views, to put a &s;top to all the preten&s;ions made upon it.</P>
<P>The point of the greate&s;t importance then under con&s;ideration <NOTE PLACE="marg">It was re&s;ol|ved to &s;et up Epi&s;copacy in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> was, whether Epi&s;copacy &s;hould be re&s;tored in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or not.
<PB N="131" REF="146">
The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> a&s;&s;ured the King, it was de&s;ired by the greater and hone&s;ter part of the nation. One Synod had as good as petitioned for it: And many others wi&s;hed for it, tho' the &s;hare they had in the late wars made them think it was not fit or de|cent for them to move for it. <HI>Sharp</HI> a&s;&s;ured the King, that none but the Prote&s;tors, of whom he had a very bad opinion, were again&s;t it; and that of the Re&s;olutioners there would not be found twenty that would oppo&s;e it. All tho&s;e who were for making the change agreed, that it ought to be done now, in the fir&s;t heat of joy after the Re&s;toration, and before the act of indemnity pa&s;s'd. The Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> and all his friends on the other hand a&s;|&s;ured the King, that the national prejudice again&s;t it was &s;till very &s;trong, that tho&s;e who &s;eemed zealous for it ran into it only as a method to procure favour, but that tho&s;e who were a|gain&s;t it would be found &s;tiff and eager in their oppo&s;ition to it, that by &s;etting it up the King would lo&s;e the affections of the nation, and that the &s;upporting it would grow a heavy load on his government. The Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> turned all this, that looked like a zeal for Pre&s;bytery, to a dextrous in&s;inuating him|&s;elf into the King's confidence; as one that de&s;igned nothing but his greatne&s;s and his having <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;ure to him, in order to the executing of any de&s;ign he might afterwards be engaged in. The King went very coldly into the de&s;ign. He &s;aid, he remembred well the aver&s;ion that he him&s;elf had ob&s;erved in that nation to any thing that looked like a &s;uperiority in the Church. But to that the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> and <HI>Sharp</HI> an&s;wered, by a&s;&s;ur|ing him that the in&s;olencies committed by the Pre&s;byterians while they governed, and the ten years u&s;urpation that had followed, had made &s;uch a change in peoples tempers, that they were much altered &s;ince he had been among them. The King naturally hat|ed Pre&s;bytery: And, having called a new Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> that did with great zeal e&s;pou&s;e the intere&s;ts of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and were now beginning to complain of the evacua|ting the garri&s;ons held by the army in that Kingdom, he gave way, tho' with a vi&s;ible reluctancy, to the change of the Church government in <HI>Scotland.</HI> The aver&s;ion he &s;eemed to expre&s;s was imputed to his own indifference as to all tho&s;e matters and to his unwillingne&s;s to involve his government in new trouble. But the view of things that the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> had given him was the true root of all that coldne&s;s. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> &s;et it on with great zeal. And &s;o did the Duke of <HI>Ormond;</HI> who &s;aid, it would be very hard to maintain the government of the Church in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> if Pre&s;bytery continued in <HI>Scotland;</HI> &s;ince the northern counties, which were the be&s;t &s;tocked of any they had, as they
<PB N="132" REF="147">
were originally from <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;o they would &s;till follow the way of that nation. Upon all this diver&s;ity of opinion, the thing was propo&s;ed in a <HI>Scotch</HI> Council at <HI>Whitehall.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> declared him&s;elf again&s;t it: But the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> Duke <HI>Ha|milton,</HI> and Sir <HI>Robert Murray,</HI> were only for delaying the mak|ing any &s;uch change, till the King &s;hould be better &s;atisfied con|cerning the inclinations of the nation. The re&s;ult of the debate (all the re&s;t who were pre&s;ent being earne&s;t for the change) was, that a letter was writ to the Privy Council of <HI>Scotland,</HI> intima|ting the King's intentions for &s;etting up Epi&s;copacy, and de|manding their advice upon it. The Earl of <HI>Glencairn</HI> ordered the letter to be read, having taken care that &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hould be pre&s;ent who he knew would &s;peak warmly for it, that &s;o others, who might intend to oppo&s;e it, might be frightened from doing it. None &s;poke again&s;t it, but the Earl of <HI>Kincairdin.</HI> He pro|po&s;ed, that &s;ome certain methods might be taken, by which they might be well informed, and &s;o be able to inform the King of the temper of the nation, before they offered an advice, that might have &s;uch effects as might very much perplex, if not di&s;|order, all their affairs. Some &s;mart repartees pa&s;&s;ed between the Earl of <HI>Glencairn</HI> and him. This was all the oppo&s;ition that was made at that board. So a letter was writ to the King from thence, encouraging him to go on, and a&s;&s;uring him, that the change he intended to make would give a general &s;atisfaction to the main body of the nation.</P>
<P>Upon that the thing was re&s;olved on. It remained after <NOTE PLACE="marg">Men &s;ought out to be Bi|&s;hops.</NOTE> this only to con&s;ider the proper methods of doing it, and the men who ought to be employed in it. <HI>Sheldon</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops had an aver&s;ion to all that had been engaged in the Covenant: So they were for &s;eeking out all the Epi&s;copal Clergy, who had been driven out of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the beginning of the trou|bles, and preferring them. There was but one of the old Bi&s;hops left alive, <HI>Syd&s;erfe,</HI> who had been Bi&s;hop of <HI>Galloway.</HI> He had come up to <HI>London,</HI> not doubting but that he &s;hould be advanced to the Primacy of <HI>Scotland.</HI> It is true, he had of late done &s;ome very irregular things: When the act of uniformity required all men who held any benefices in <HI>England</HI> to be epi&s;copally ordained, he, who by ob&s;erving the ill effects of their former violence was become very moderate, with others of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Clergy that ga|thered about him, did &s;et up a very indefen&s;ible practice of or|daining all tho&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Clergy who came to him, and that without demanding either oaths or &s;ub&s;criptions of them. Some believed, that this was done by him, only to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the fees that aro&s;e from the letters of orders &s;o granted; for he was
<PB N="133" REF="148">
very poor. This did &s;o di&s;gu&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops at him and his company, that they took no care of him or them. Yet they were much again&s;t a &s;et of Pre&s;byterian Bi&s;hops. They believed they could have no credit, and that they would have no zeal. This touched <HI>Sharp</HI> to the quick: So he laid the matter before the Earl of <HI>Clarendon.</HI> He &s;aid, the&s;e old Epi&s;copal men by their long ab&s;ence out of <HI>Scotland</HI> knew nothing of the pre&s;ent genera|tion: And by the ill u&s;age they had met with they were &s;o irritated, that they would run matters quickly to great extremities: And, if there was a faction among the Bi&s;hops, &s;ome valuing them&s;elves upon their con&s;tant &s;teddine&s;s, and looking with an ill eye on tho&s;e who had been carried away with the &s;tream, this would di|vide and di&s;tract their coun&s;els; whereas a &s;et of men of moderate principles would be more uniform in their proceedings. This prevailed with the Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> who &s;aw the King &s;o remi&s;s in that matter, that he re&s;olved to keep things in as great temper as was po&s;&s;ible. And he, not doubting but that <HI>Sharp</HI> would pur&s;ue that in which he &s;eemed to be &s;o zealous and hot, and carry things with great moderation, per&s;uaded the Bi&s;hops of <HI>England</HI> to leave the management of that matter wholly to him. And <HI>Sharp,</HI> being a&s;&s;ured of that at which he had long aimed, laid a&s;ide his ma&s;k; and owned, that he was to be Archbi&s;hop of St. <HI>Andrews.</HI> He &s;aid to &s;ome, from whom I had it, that when he &s;aw that the King was re&s;olved on the change, and that &s;ome hot men were like to be advanced, who&s;e violence would ruin the country, he had &s;ubmitted to that po&s;t on de&s;ign to moderate matters, and to cover &s;ome good men from a &s;torm that might otherwi&s;e break upon them. So deeply did he &s;till di&s;|&s;emble: For now he talked of nothing &s;o much as of love and moderation.</P>
<P><HI>Syd&s;erfe</HI> was removed to be Bi&s;hop of <HI>Orkney,</HI> one of the be&s;t revenues of any of the Bi&s;hopricks in <HI>Scotland:</HI> But it had been almo&s;t in all times a <HI>Sine-Cure.</HI> He lived little more than a year after his tran&s;lation. He had died in more e&s;teem, if he had di|ed a year before it. But <HI>Sharp</HI> was ordered to find out proper men for filling up the other Sees. That care was left entirely to him. The choice was generally very bad.</P>
<P>Two men were brought up to be con&s;ecrated in <HI>England, Fair|foul</HI> de&s;igned for the &s;ee of <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> and <HI>Hamilton,</HI> brother to the Lord <HI>Belhaven,</HI> for <HI>Galloway.</HI> The former of the&s;e was a plea&s;ant and facetious man, in&s;inuating and crafty: But he was a better phy&s;ician than a divine. His life was &s;carce free from &s;candal: And he was eminent in nothing that belonged to his own function. He had not only &s;worn the Covenant, but had per|&s;uaded
<PB N="134" REF="149">
others to do it. And when one objected to him, that it went again&s;t his con&s;cience, he an&s;wered, there were &s;ome very good medicines that could not be chewed, but were to be &s;wal|lowed down; and &s;ince it was plain that a man could not live in <HI>Scotland</HI> unle&s;s he &s;ware it, therefore it mu&s;t be &s;wallowed down without any farther examination. Whatever the matter was, &s;oon after the con&s;ecration his parts &s;unk &s;o fa&s;t, that in a few months he, who had pa&s;s'd his whole life long for one of the cunninge&s;t men in <HI>Scotland,</HI> became almo&s;t a changling; up|on which it may be ea&s;ily collected what commentaries the Pre&s;|byterians would make. <HI>Sharp</HI> lamented this to me, as one of their great misfortunes. He &s;aid, it began to appear in le&s;s than a month after he came to <HI>London. Hamilton</HI> was a good na|tured man, but weak. He was always believed Epi&s;copal. Yet he had &s;o far complied in the time of the Covenant, that he affected a peculiar expre&s;&s;ion of his counterfeit zeal for their cau&s;e, to &s;ecure him&s;elf from &s;u&s;picion: When he gave the &s;acrament, he excommunicated all that were not true to the Covenant, u&s;ing a form in the Old Te&s;tament of &s;haking out the lap of his gown; &s;aying, &s;o did he ca&s;t out of the Church and communion all that dealt fal&s;ely in the Covenant.</P>
<P>With the&s;e there was a fourth man found out, who was then <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bi&s;hop <HI>Leightoun</HI>'s character.</NOTE> at <HI>London</HI> at his return from the <HI>Bath,</HI> where he had been for his health: And on him I will enlarge more copiou&s;ly. He was the &s;on of Doctor <HI>Leightoun,</HI> who had in Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI>'s time writ <HI>Zion's plea again&s;t the Prelates;</HI> for which he was condemn|ed in the Star-Chamber to have his ears cut and his no&s;e &s;lit. He was a man of a violent and ungoverned heat. He &s;ent his elde&s;t &s;on <HI>Robert</HI> to be bred in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who was accounted a Saint from his youth up. He had great quickne&s;s of parts, a lively apprehen&s;ion, with a charming vivacity of thought and expre&s;&s;ion. He had the greate&s;t command of the pure&s;t <HI>Latin</HI> that ever I knew in any man. He was a ma&s;ter both of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew,</HI> and of the whole compa&s;s of theological learning, chiefly in the &s;tudy of the Scriptures. But that which excelled all the re&s;t was, he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the highe&s;t and noble&s;t &s;en&s;e of divine things that I ever &s;aw in any man. He had no regard to his per&s;on, unle&s;s it was to mortify it by a con&s;tant low diet, that was like a perpetual fa&s;t. He had a contempt both of wealth and reputation. He &s;eemed to have the lowe&s;t thoughts of him&s;elf po&s;&s;ible, and to de&s;ire that all other per&s;ons &s;hould think as mean|ly of him as he did him&s;elf: He bore all &s;orts of ill u&s;age and reproach, like a man that took plea&s;ure in it. He had &s;o &s;ubdued the natural heat of his temper, that in a great variety of acci|dents,
<PB N="135" REF="150">
and in a cour&s;e of twenty two years intimate conver&s;ation with him, I never ob&s;erved the lea&s;t &s;ign of pa&s;&s;ion, but upon one &s;ingle occa&s;ion. He brought him&s;elf into &s;o compo&s;ed a gravity, that I never &s;aw him laugh, and but &s;eldom &s;mile. And he kept him&s;elf in &s;uch a con&s;tant recollection, that I do not remember that ever I heard him &s;ay one idle word. There was a vi&s;ible tendency in all he &s;aid to rai&s;e his own mind, and tho&s;e he con|ver&s;ed with, to &s;erious reflections. He &s;eemed to be in a perpe|tual meditation. And, tho' the whole cour&s;e of his life was &s;trict and a&s;cetical, yet he had nothing of the &s;ourne&s;s of temper that generally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es men of that &s;ort. He was the free&s;t from &s;uper|&s;tition, of cen&s;uring others, or of impo&s;ing his own methods on them, po&s;&s;ible. So that he did not &s;o much as recommend them to others. He &s;aid, there was a diver&s;ity of tempers; and every man was to watch over his own, and to turn it in the be&s;t man|ner he could. His thoughts were lively, oft out of the way and &s;urprizing, yet ju&s;t and genuine. And he had laid together in his memory the greate&s;t trea&s;ure of the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of all the ancient &s;ayings of the heathens as well as chri&s;tians, that I have ever known any man ma&s;ter of: And he u&s;ed them in the apte&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible. He had been bred up with the greate&s;t aver&s;ion imaginable to the whole frame of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> From <HI>Scotland</HI> his father &s;ent him to travel. He &s;pent &s;ome years in <HI>France,</HI> and &s;poke that language like one born there. He came afterwards and &s;ettled in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had Pre&s;byterian ordina|tion. But he quickly broke thro' the prejudices of his education. His preaching had a &s;ublimity both of thought and expre&s;&s;ion in it. The grace and gravity of his pronounciation was &s;uch, that few heard him without a very &s;en&s;ible emotion: I am &s;ure I ne|ver did. His &s;tyle was rather too fine: But there was a maje&s;ty and beauty in it that left &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion, that I cannot yet forget the &s;ermons I heard him preach thirty years ago. And yet with this he &s;eemed to look on him&s;elf as &s;o ordinary a preacher, that while he had a cure he was ready to employ all others: And when he was a Bi&s;hop he cho&s;e to preach to &s;mall auditories, and would never give notice before hand: He had indeed a very low voice, and &s;o could not be heard by a great croud. He &s;oon came to &s;ee into the follies of the Pre&s;byterians, and to di&s;like their Co|venant; particularly the impo&s;ing it, and their fury again&s;t all who differed from them. He found they were not capable of large thoughts: Theirs were narrow, as their tempers were &s;our. So he grew weary of mixing with them. He &s;carce ever went to their meetings, and lived in great retirement, minding only the care of his own pari&s;h at <HI>Newbottle</HI> near <HI>Edenburgh.</HI> Yet all the oppo&s;iti|on
<PB N="136" REF="151">
that he made to them was, that he preached up a more ex|act rule of life than &s;eemed to them con&s;i&s;tent with human na|ture: But his own practice did even out&s;hine his doctrine.</P>
<P>In the year 1648 he declared him&s;elf for the engagement for the King. But the Earl of <HI>Lothian,</HI> who lived in his pari&s;h, had &s;o high an e&s;teem for him, that he per&s;uaded the violent men not to meddle with him: Tho' he gave occa&s;ion to great exception; for when &s;ome of his pari&s;h, who had been in the engagement, were ordered to make publick profe&s;&s;ion of their repentance for it, he told them, they had been in an expedition, in which, he believed, they had neglected their duty to God, and had been guilty of inju&s;tice and violence, of drunkenne&s;s and other im|moralities, and he charged them to repent of the&s;e very &s;eriou&s;|ly, without meddling with the quarrel or the grounds of that war. He entred into a great corre&s;pondence with many of the Epi&s;copal party, and with my own father in particular; and did wholly &s;eparate him&s;elf from the Pre&s;byterians. At la&s;t he left them, and withdrew from his cure: For he could not do the things impo&s;ed on him any longer. And yet he hated all con|tention &s;o much, that he cho&s;e rather to leave them in a &s;ilent manner, than to engage in any di&s;putes with them. But he had generally the reputation of a Saint, and of &s;omething above hu|man nature in him: So the ma&s;ter&s;hip of the College of <HI>Eden|burgh</HI> falling vacant &s;ome time after, and it being in the gift of the city, he was prevail'd with to accept of it, becau&s;e in it he was wholly &s;eparated from all Church matters. He continued ten years in that po&s;t: And was a great ble&s;&s;ing in it; for he talked &s;o to all the youth of any capacity or di&s;tinction, that it had great effect on many of them. He preached often to them: And if crouds broke in, which they were apt to do, he would have gone on in his &s;ermon in <HI>Latin,</HI> with a purity and life that charmed all who under&s;tood it. Thus he had lived above twenty years in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the highe&s;t reputation that any man in my time ever had in that Kingdom.</P>
<P>He had a brother well known at Court, Sir <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> who was very like him in face and in the vivacity of his parts, but the mo&s;t unlike him in all other things that can be imagined: For, tho' he loved to talk of great &s;ublimities in religion, yet he was a very immoral man. He was a Papi&s;t of a form of his own: But he had changed his religion to rai&s;e him&s;elf at Court; for he was at that time Secretary to the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and was very intimate with the Lord <HI>Aubigny,</HI> a brother of the Duke of <HI>Rich|mond</HI>'s, who had changed his religion, and was a Prie&s;t, and had probably been a Cardinal if he had lived a little longer. He
<PB N="137" REF="152">
maintained an outward decency, and had more learning and better notions, than men of quality, who enter into orders in that Church, generally have. Yet he was a very vicious man: And that perhaps made him the more con&s;idered by the King, who loved and tru&s;ted him to a high degree. No man had more cre|dit with the King; for he was on the &s;ecret as to his religion, and was more tru&s;ted with the whole de&s;ign, that was then ma|naged in order to e&s;tabli&s;h it, than any man what&s;oever. Sir <HI>Eli|&s;ha</HI> brought his brother and him acquainted: For <HI>Leightoun</HI> lov|ed to know men in all the varieties of religion.</P>
<P>In the vacation time he made excur&s;ions, and came oft to <HI>Lon|don;</HI> where he ob&s;erved all the eminent men in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Court, and in the &s;everal parties then about the city of <HI>London.</HI> But he told me, he could never &s;ee any thing among them that plea&s;ed him. They were men of unquiet and meddling tempers: And their di&s;cour&s;es and &s;ermons were dry and un&s;avoury, full of airy cant, or of bomba&s;t &s;wellings. Sometimes he went over to <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> to &s;ee what he could find in the &s;everal orders of the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> There he found &s;ome of <HI>Jan&s;enius</HI>'s followers, who &s;eemed to be men of extraordinary tempers, and &s;tudied to bring things, if po&s;&s;ible, to the purity and &s;implicity of the primitive ages; on which all his thoughts were much &s;et. He thought controver&s;ies had been too much in&s;i&s;ted on, and had been car|ried too far. His brother, who thought of nothing but the rai&s;ing him&s;elf at Court, fancied that his being made a Bi&s;hop might render him&s;elf more con&s;iderable. So he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Lord <HI>Au|bigny</HI> with &s;uch an opinion of him, that he made the King ap|prehend, that a man of his piety and his notions (and his not being married was not forgot) might contribute to carry on their de&s;ign. He fancied &s;uch a mona&s;tick man, who had a great &s;tretch of thought, and &s;o many other eminent qualities, would be a mean at lea&s;t to prepare the nation for Popery, if he did not directly come over to them; for his brother did not &s;tick to &s;ay, he was &s;ure that lay at root with him. So the King named him of his own proper motion, which gave all tho&s;e that began to &s;u&s;pect the King him&s;elf great jealou&s;ies of him. <HI>Leightoun</HI> was aver&s;e to this promotion, as much as was po&s;&s;ible. His brother had great power over him; for he took care to hide his vices from him, and to make before him a &s;hew of piety. He &s;eemed to be a Pa|pi&s;t rather in name and &s;hew than in reality, of which I will &s;et down one in&s;tance that was then much talked of. Some of the Church of <HI>England</HI> loved to magnify the &s;acrament in an extra|ordinary manner, affirming the real pre&s;ence, only blaming the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> for defining the manner of it; &s;aying, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>
<PB N="138" REF="153">
was pre&s;ent in a mo&s;t unconceivable manner. This was &s;o much the mode, that the King and all the Court went into it. So the King, upon &s;ome raillery about tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, a&s;ked Sir <HI>Eli|&s;ha</HI> if he believed it. He an&s;wered, he could not well tell; but he was &s;ure the Church of <HI>England</HI> believed it. And when the King &s;eemed amazed at that, he replied, do not you believe that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is pre&s;ent in a mo&s;t unconceivable manner? Which the King granted: Then &s;aid he, that is ju&s;t tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, the mo&s;t unconceivable thing that was ever yet invented. When <HI>Leightoun</HI> was prevailed on to accept a Bi&s;hoprick, he cho&s;e <HI>Dunblane,</HI> a &s;mall dioce&s;e as well as a little revenue. But the Deanry of the Chapel Royal was annexed to that &s;ee. So he was willing to engage in that, that he might &s;et up the Common Prayer in the King's Chapel; for the rebuilding of which orders were given. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Clergy were well plea&s;ed with him, finding him both more learned, and more thoroughly the irsin the other points of uniformity, than the re&s;t of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Cler|gy, whom they could not much value. And tho' <HI>Sheldon</HI> did not much like his great &s;trictne&s;s, in which he had no mind to imi|tate him, yet he thought &s;uch a man as he was might give cre|dit to Epi&s;copacy, in its fir&s;t introduction to a nation much pre|judiced again&s;t it. <HI>Sharp</HI> did not know what to make of all this. He neither liked his &s;trictne&s;s of life, nor his notions. He believ|ed, they would not take the &s;ame methods, and fancied he might be much ob&s;cured by him; for he &s;aw he would be well &s;upport|ed. He &s;aw the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> began to magnify him. And &s;o <HI>Sharp</HI> did all he could to di&s;courage him, but without any ef|fect; for he had no regard to him. I bear &s;till the greate&s;t ve|neration for the memory of that man that I do for any per&s;on; and reckon my early knowledge of him, which happened the year after this, and my long and intimate conver&s;ation with him, that continued to his death for twenty three years, among the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of my life, and for which I know I mu&s;t give an account to God in the great day in a mo&s;t particular manner. And yet, tho' I know this account of his promotion may &s;eem a blemi&s;h upon him, I would not conceal it, being re&s;olved to write of all per&s;ons and things with all po&s;&s;ible candor. I had the re|lation of it from him&s;elf, and more particularly from his bro|ther. But what hopes &s;oever the Papi&s;ts had of him at this time, when he knew nothing of the de&s;ign of bringing in Popery, and had therefore talked of &s;ome points of Popery with the freedom of an ab&s;tracted and &s;peculative man; yet he expre&s;&s;ed another &s;en&s;e of the matter, when he came to &s;ee it was really intended to be brought in among us. He then &s;poke of Popery in the com|plex
<PB N="139" REF="154">
at much another rate: And he &s;eemed to have more zeal again&s;t it, than I thought was in his nature with relation to any points in controver&s;y; for his ab&s;traction made him &s;eem cold in all tho&s;e matters. But he gave all who conver&s;ed with him a very different view of Popery, when he &s;aw we were really in danger of coming under the power of a religion, that had, as he u&s;ed to &s;ay, much of the wi&s;edom that was earthly, &s;en&s;ual, and devili&s;h, but had nothing in it of the wi&s;edom that was from above, and was pure and peaceable. He did indeed think the corruptions and creulties of Popery were &s;uch gro&s;s and odi|ous things, that nothing could have maintained that Church un|der tho&s;e ju&s;t and vi&s;ible prejudices, but the &s;everal orders among them, which had an appearance of mortification and contempt of the world, and with all the tra&s;h that was among them main|tained a face of piety and devotion. He al&s;o thought the great and fatal error of the Reformation was, that more of tho&s;e hou&s;es, and of that cour&s;e of life, free from the entanglements of vows and other mixtures, was not pre&s;erved: So that the Prote&s;tant Churches had neither places of education, nor retreat for men of mortified tempers. I have dwelt long upon this man's cha|racter. But it was &s;o &s;ingular that it &s;eemed to de&s;erve it. And I was &s;o &s;ingularly ble&s;s'd by knowing him as I did, that I am &s;ure he de&s;erved it of me, that I &s;hould give &s;o full aview of him; which I hope may be of &s;ome u&s;e to the world.</P>
<P>When the time fixed for the con&s;ecration of the Bi&s;hops of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops con|&s;ecrated.</NOTE> <HI>Scotland</HI> came on, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops finding that <HI>Sharp</HI> and <HI>Leightoun</HI> had not Epi&s;copal ordination, as Prie&s;ts and Deacons, the other two having been ordained by Bi&s;hops before the wars, they &s;tood upon it, that they mu&s;t be ordain'd, fir&s;t Deacons and then Prie&s;ts. <HI>Sharp</HI> was very unea&s;ie at this, and remembred them of what had happened when King <HI>James</HI> had &s;et up Epi&s;copacy. Bi&s;hop <HI>Andrews</HI> moved at that time the ordaining them, as was now propo&s;ed: But that was overruled by King <HI>James,</HI> who thought it went too far towards the unchurching of all tho&s;e who had no Bi&s;hops among them. But the late war, and the di&s;putes during that time, had rai&s;ed the&s;e controver&s;ies higher, and brought men to &s;tricter notions, and to maintain them with more fierce|ne&s;s. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops did al&s;o &s;ay, that by the late act of uni|formity that matter was more po&s;itively &s;ettled, than it had been before; &s;o that they could not legally con&s;ecrate any, but tho&s;e who were, according to that con&s;titution, made fir&s;t Prie&s;ts and Deacons. They al&s;o made this difference between the pre&s;ent time and King <HI>James</HI>'s: For then the <HI>Scots</HI> were only in an im|perfect &s;tate, having never had Bi&s;hops among them &s;ince the
<PB N="140" REF="155">
Reformation; &s;o in &s;uch a &s;tate of things, in which they had been under a real nece&s;&s;ity, it was rea&s;onable to allow of their orders, how defective &s;oever: But that of late they had been in a &s;tate of &s;chi&s;m, had revolted from their Bi&s;hops, and had thrown off that order; &s;o that orders given in &s;uch a wilful oppo&s;ition to the whole con&s;titution of the primitive Church was a thing of another nature. They were po&s;itive in the point, and would not di&s;pen&s;e with it. <HI>Sharp</HI> &s;tuck more at it, than could have been expected from a man that had &s;wallowed down greater mat|ters. <HI>Leightoun</HI> did not &s;tand much upon it. He did not think orders given without Bi&s;hops were null and void. He thought, the forms of government were not &s;ettled by &s;uch po&s;itive laws as were unalterable; but only by Apo&s;tolical practices, which, as he thought, authori&s;ed Epi&s;copacy as the be&s;t form. Yet he did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to the being of a Church. But he thought that every Church might make &s;uch rules of ordination as they plea&s;ed, and that they might re-ordain all that came to them from any other Church; and that the re-ordaining a Prie&s;t ordained in another Church imported no more, but that they received him into orders according to their rules, and did not infer the annul|ling the orders he had formerly received. The&s;e two were up|on this privately ordained Deacons and Prie&s;ts. And then all the four were con&s;ecrated publickly in the Abbey of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter. Leightoun</HI> told me, he was much &s;truck with the fea&s;ting and jollity of that day: It had not &s;uch an appearance of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s or piety, as became the new modelling of a Church. When that was over, he made &s;ome attempts to work up <HI>Sharp</HI> to the two de&s;igns which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him mo&s;t. The one was, to try what could be done towards the uniting the Pre&s;byterians and them. He offered <HI>U&s;her</HI>'s reduction, as the plan upon which they ought to form their &s;chemes. The other was, to try how they could rai&s;e men to a truer and higher &s;en&s;e of piety, and bring the wor&s;hip of that Church out of their <HI>extempore</HI> methods into more order; and &s;o to prepare them for a more regu|lar way of wor&s;hip, which he thought was of much more impor|tance than a form of government. But he was amazed, when he ob&s;erved that <HI>Sharp</HI> had neither formed any &s;cheme, nor &s;eemed &s;o much as willing to talk of any. He reckoned, they would be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, and &s;o would be legally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their Bi&s;hopricks: And then every Bi&s;hop was to do the be&s;t he could to get all once to &s;ubmit to his authority: And when that point was carried, they might proceed to other things, as &s;hould be found expedient: But he did not care to lay down any &s;cheme. <HI>Fair&s;oul,</HI> when he talked

to him, had always a merry tale ready at hand to divert him: So that he avoided all &s;erious di&s;cour&s;e, and indeed did not &s;eem capable of any. By the&s;e means <HI>Leightoun</HI> quickly lo&s;t all heart and hope; and &s;aid often to me upon it, that in the whole pro|gre&s;s of that affair there appeared &s;uch cro&s;s characters of an an|gry providence, that, how fully &s;oever he was &s;atisfied in his own mind as to Epi&s;copacy it&s;elf, yet it &s;eemed that God was again&s;t them, and that they were not like to be the men that &s;hould build up his Church; &s;o that the &s;truggling about it &s;eemed to him like a fighting again&s;t God. He who had the greate&s;t hand in it proceeded with &s;o much di&s;&s;imulation; and the re&s;t of the order were &s;o mean, and &s;o &s;elfi&s;h; and the Earl of <HI>Midletoun,</HI> with the other &s;ecular men that conducted it, were &s;o openly impious and vitious, that it did ca&s;t a reproach on every thing relating to religion to &s;ee it managed by &s;uch in&s;truments.</P>
<P>All the &s;teps that were made afterwards were of a piece with <NOTE PLACE="marg">1662. The m$span$|ings of the $span$ forbidden.</NOTE> this melancholy beginning. Upon the con&s;ecration of the Bi|&s;hops, the Pre&s;byteries of <HI>Scotland</HI> that were &s;till &s;itting began now to declare openly again&s;t Epi&s;copacy, and to prepare prote&s;tati|ons, or other acts or in&s;truments, again&s;t them. Some were talking of entring into new engagements again&s;t the &s;ubmitting to them. So <HI>Sharp</HI> moved, that, &s;ince the King had &s;et up Epi&s;copacy, a Proclamation might be i&s;&s;ued out, forbiddnig Cler|gymen to meet together in any Pre&s;bytery, or other judicatory, till the Bi&s;hops &s;hould &s;ettle a method of proceeding in them. Upon the &s;etting out this Proclamation, a general obedience was given to it: Only the mini&s;ters, to keep up a &s;hew of acting on an Eccle&s;ia&s;tick authority, met once and entred into their Books a prote&s;tation again&s;t the Proclamation, as an inva&s;ion on the liberties of the Church, to which they declared they gave obedi|ence only for a time, and for peace &s;ake. <HI>Sharp</HI> procured this without any advice: And it proved very fatal. For when King <HI>James</HI> brought in the Bi&s;hops before, they had &s;till &s;uffered the inferiour judicatories to continue &s;itting, till the Bi&s;hops came, and &s;ate down among them: Some of them prote&s;ted indeed again&s;t that: Yet they &s;ate on ever after: And &s;o the whole Church had a face of unity, while all &s;ate together in the &s;ame judicatories, tho' upon different principles. The old Pre&s;$yte|rians &s;aid, they &s;ate &s;till as in a Court &s;ettled by the laws of the Church and State: And tho' they looked on the Bi&s;hops &s;itting among them, and a&s;&s;uming a negative vote, as an u&s;urpation, yet, they &s;aid, it did not infer a nullity on the Court: Where|as now, by this &s;ilencing the&s;e Courts, the ca&s;e was much alter|ed.
<PB N="142" REF="157">
For if they had continued &s;itting, and the Bi&s;hops had come among them, they would have &s;aid, it was like the bearing with an u&s;urpation, when there was no remedy: And what prote&s;tati|ons &s;oever they might have made, or what oppo&s;ition &s;oever they might have given the Bi&s;hops, that would have been kept within their own walls, but would not have broken out into &s;uch a di&s;traction, as the nation was ca&s;t into upon this: All the op|po&s;ition that might have been made would have died with tho&s;e few that were di&s;po&s;ed to make it: And, upon due care to fill the vacant places with worthy and well affected men, the nation might have been brought off from their prejudices. But the&s;e Courts being now once broken, and brought together afterwards by a &s;ort of connivance, without any legal authority, only as the Bi&s;hops a&s;&s;i&s;tants and officials, to give him advice, and to act in his name, they pretended they could not &s;it in them any more, unle&s;s they &s;hould change their principles and become throughly Epi&s;copal, which was too great a turn to be &s;oon brought about. So fatally did <HI>Sharp</HI> precipitate matters. He affected to have the reins of the Church wholly put into his hands. The Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was not &s;orry to &s;ee him commit errors; &s;ince the wor&s;e things were managed, his advices would be thereby the more ju&s;tified. And the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> and his party took no care of any bu&s;ine&s;s, being almo&s;t perpetually drunk: By which they came in a great mea&s;ure to loo&s;e the King. For, tho', upon a frolick, the King, with a few in who&s;e company he took plea&s;ure, would &s;ometimes run into exce&s;s, yet he did it &s;eldom, and had a very bad opinion of all that got into the habit and love of drunkenne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops came down to <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;oon after their con&s;ecra|tion, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The new Bi&s;hops came down to <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> all in one coach. <HI>Leightoun</HI> told me, he believed they were weary of him, for he was very weary of them: But he, find|ing they intended to be received at <HI>Edenburgh</HI> with &s;ome pomp, left them at <HI>Morpeth,</HI> and came to <HI>Edenburgh</HI> a few days before them. He hated all the appearances of vanity. He would not have the title of Lord given him by his friends, and was not ea&s;y when others forced it on him. In this I always thought him too &s;tiff: It provoked the other Bi&s;hops, and looked like &s;in|gularity and affectation, and furni&s;hed tho&s;e that were prejudiced again&s;t him with a &s;pecious appearance, to repre&s;ent him as a man of odd notions and practices. The Lord Chancellour, with all the Nobility and Privy Councellours, then at <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> went out, together with the Magi&s;tracy of the city, and brought the Bi&s;hops in, as in triumph. I looked on; And tho' I was thoroughly Epi&s;copal, yet I thought there was &s;omewhat in the
<PB N="143" REF="158">
pomp of that entry, that did not look like the humility that be|came their function: Soon after their arrival, &s;ix other Bi&s;hops were con&s;ecrated, but not ordained Prie&s;ts and Deacons. The See of <HI>Edenburgh</HI> was for &s;ome time kept vacant. <HI>Sharp</HI> hoped that <HI>Douglas</HI> might be prevailed on to accept it: But he would enter into no treaty about it. So the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> forced up|on <HI>Sharp</HI> one <HI>Wi&s;hart,</HI> who had been the Marquis of <HI>Montro&s;e</HI>'s chaplain, and had been taken pri&s;oner, and u&s;ed with &s;o much cruelty in the jayl of <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> that it &s;eem'd but ju&s;tice to ad|vance a man in that place, where he had &s;uffer'd &s;o much.</P>
<P>The &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament came on in <HI>April</HI> 1662: Where the <NOTE PLACE="marg">They were brought into Parliament.</NOTE> fir&s;t thing that was propo&s;ed by the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> was, that &s;ince the act re&s;ci&s;&s;ory had annulled all the Parliaments after that held in the year 1633, the former laws in favour of Epi&s;|copacy were now again in force, the King had re&s;tored that function which had been &s;o long glorious in the Church, and for which his ble&s;&s;ed father had &s;uffered &s;o much: And tho' the Bi|&s;hops had a right to come and take their place in Parliament, yet it was a piece of re&s;pect to &s;end &s;ome of every &s;tate to invite them to come, and &s;it among them. This was agreed to: So upon the me&s;&s;age the Bi&s;hops came and took their places. <HI>Leigh|toun</HI> went not with them, as indeed he never came to Parliament but when there was &s;omething before them that related to religi|on, or to the Church.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t act that pa&s;&s;ed in this &s;e&s;&s;ion was for re&s;toring Epi&s;|copacy, and &s;ettling the government of the Church in their hands. <HI>Sharp</HI> had the framing of this act, as <HI>Primero&s;e</HI> told me. The whole government and juri&s;diction of the Church in the &s;e|veral dioce&s;es was declared to be lodged in the Bi&s;hops, which they were to exerci&s;e with the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch of their clergy, as were of known loyalty and prudence: All men that held any benefice in the Church were required to own and &s;ubmit to the government of the Church, as now by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. This was plainly the &s;etting Epi&s;copacy on another bottom, than it had been ever on in <HI>Scotland</HI> before this time: For the whole body of the Pre&s;byterians did formerly maintain &s;uch a &s;hare in the admini&s;tration, that the Bi&s;hops had never pretended to any more, than to be their &s;ettled Pre&s;idents with a negative voice up|on them. But now it was &s;aid, that the whole power was lodg|ed &s;imply in the Bi&s;hop, who was only bound to carry along with him in the admini&s;tration &s;o many Pre&s;byters, as he thought fit to &s;ingle out, as his advi&s;ers and a&s;&s;i&s;tants; which was the tak|ing all power out of the body of the Clergy: Church judicato|rics were now made only the Bi&s;hop's a&s;&s;i&s;tants: And the few of
<PB N="144" REF="159">
the Clergy that mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t being to be pickt out by him, that was only a matter of &s;hew; nor had they any authority lodged with them, all that being ve&s;ted only in the Bi&s;hop: Nor did it e&s;cape cen&s;ure, that among the qualifications of tho&s;e Pre&s;byters that were to be the Bi&s;hop's advi&s;ers and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, loyalty and prudence were only named, and that piety and learning were forgot, which mu&s;t always be reckoned the fir&s;t qualifications of the Clergy. As to the obligation to own and &s;ubmit to the go|vernment thus e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, they &s;aid, it was hard to &s;ub|mit to &s;o high an authority as was now lodged with the Bi&s;hops; but to require them to own it, &s;eemed to import an antecedent approving, or at lea&s;t a &s;ub&s;equent ju&s;tifying of &s;uch an authori|ty, which carried the matter far beyond a bare obedience, even to an impo&s;ing upon con&s;cience. The&s;e were not only the ex|ceptions made by the Pre&s;byterians, but by the Epi&s;copal men them&s;elves, who had never carried the argument farther in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> than for a precedency, with &s;ome authority in ordination, and a negative in matters of juri&s;diction. They thought, the bo|dy of the Clergy ought to be a check upon the Bi&s;hops, and that, without the con&s;ent of the majority, they ought not to be legal|ly impowered to act in &s;o imperious a manner, as was warranted by this act. Many of them would never &s;ub&s;cribe to this form of owning and &s;ubmitting: And the more prudent Bi&s;hops did not impo&s;e it on their Clergy. The whole frame of the act was li|able to great cen&s;ure. It was thought an unexcu&s;able piece of madne&s;s, that, when a government was brought in upon a na|tion &s;o aver&s;e to it, the fir&s;t &s;tep &s;hould carry their power &s;o high. All the Bi&s;hops, except <HI>Sharp,</HI> di&s;owned their having any &s;hare in the penning this act; which indeed was pa&s;s'd in ha&s;te, with|out due con&s;ideration. Nor did any of the Bi&s;hops, no not <HI>Sharp</HI> him&s;elf, ever carry their authority &s;o high, as by the act they were warranted to do. But all the enemies to Epi&s;copacy had this act ever in their mouths, to excu&s;e their not &s;ubmitting to it; and &s;aid, it a&s;&s;erted a greater &s;tretch of authority in Bi&s;hops, than they them&s;elves thought fit to a&s;&s;ume.</P>
<P>Soon after that act pa&s;s'd, &s;ome of the Pre&s;byterian preachers <NOTE PLACE="marg">Scruples a|bout the oath of &s;u|premacy.</NOTE> were &s;ummoned to an&s;wer before the Parliament for &s;ome reflec|tions made in their &s;ermons again&s;t Epi&s;copacy. But nothing could be made of it: For their words were general, and capable of different &s;en&s;es. So it was re&s;olved, for a proof of their loy|alty, to tender them the oath of allegiance and &s;upremacy. That had been enacted in the former Parliament, and was refu&s;ed by none, but the Earl of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ilis.</HI> He de&s;ired, that an explana+tion might be made of the &s;upremacy: The words of the oath
<PB N="145" REF="160">
were large: And when the oath was enacted in <HI>England,</HI> a clear explanation was given in one of the articles of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and more copiou&s;ly afterwards in a di&s;cour&s;e by Archbi|&s;hop <HI>U&s;her,</HI> publi&s;hed by King <HI>James</HI>'s order. But the Parlia|ment would not &s;atisfy him &s;o far. And they were well plea&s;ed to &s;ee &s;cruples rai&s;ed about the oath, that &s;o a colour might be put on their &s;everities again&s;t &s;uch as &s;hould refu&s;e it, as being men that refu&s;ed to &s;wear allegiance to the King. Upon that the Earl of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ilis</HI> left the Parliament, and quitted all his em|ployments: For he was man of a mo&s;t inflexible firmne&s;s. Ma|ny &s;aid, there was no need of an explanation, &s;ince how ambi|guous &s;oever the words might be in them&s;elves, yet that oath, be|ing brought to <HI>Scotland</HI> from <HI>England,</HI> ought to be under&s;tood in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e in which it was impo&s;ed in that Kingdom. On the other hand, there was ju&s;t rea&s;on for &s;ome mens being tender in &s;o &s;acred a matter as an oath. The Earl of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ilis</HI> had offered to take the oath, provided he might join his explanation to it. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> was contented to let him &s;ay what he plea&s;ed, but he would not &s;uffer him to put it in writing. The Mini&s;ters, to whom it was now tendred, offered to take it upon the &s;ame terms; and in a petition to the Lords of the articles they offered their explanation. Upon that a debate aro&s;e, whe|ther an act explanatory of the oath &s;hould be offered to the Par|liament, or not. This was the fir&s;t time that <HI>Leightoun</HI> appeared in Parliament. He pre&s;&s;ed, it might be done, with much zeal. He &s;aid, the land mourned by rea&s;on of the many oaths that had been taken: The words of this oath were certainly capable of a bad &s;en&s;e: In compa&s;&s;ion to Papi&s;ts a limited &s;en&s;e had been put on them in <HI>England:</HI> And he thought there &s;hould be a like tender|ne&s;s &s;hewed to Prote&s;tants, e&s;pecially when the &s;cruple was ju&s;t, and there was an oath in the ca&s;e, in which the matter ought cer|tainly to be made clear: To act otherwi&s;e looked like the laying &s;nares for people, and the making men offenders for a word. <HI>Sharp</HI> took this ill from him, and replied upon him with great bitterne&s;s. And &s;aid, it was below the dignity of government to make acts to &s;atisfie the weak &s;cruples of peevi&s;h men: It ill be|came them, who had impo&s;ed their Covenant on all people with|out any explanation, and had forced all to take it, now to ex|pect &s;uch extraordinary favours. <HI>Leightoun</HI> in&s;i&s;ted, that it ought to be done for that very rea&s;on, that all people might &s;ee a dif|ference between the mild proceedings of the government now, and their &s;everity: And that it ill became the very &s;ame per&s;ons, who had complained of that rigour, now to practi&s;e it them&s;elves; for thus it may be &s;aid, the world goes mad by turns. This was
<PB N="146" REF="161">
ill taken by the Earl of <HI>Midletoun,</HI> and all his party: For they de&s;igned to keep the matter &s;o, that the Pre&s;byterians &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with many &s;cruples on this head; and that, when any of the party &s;hould be brought before them, whom they be|lieved in fault, but had not full proof again&s;t, the oath &s;hould be tendred as the trial of their allegiance, and that on their refu|&s;ing it they &s;hould cen&s;ure them as they thought fit. So the Mini|&s;ters petition was rejected, and they were required to take the oath as it &s;tood in the law, without putting any &s;en&s;e upon it. They refu&s;ed to do it, and were upon that condemned to perpetual ba|ni&s;hment, as men that denied allegiance to the King. And by this an engine was found out to bani&s;h as many as they plea&s;ed: For the re&s;olution was taken up by the whole party to refu&s;e it, unle&s;s with an explanation. So &s;oon did men forget all their for|mer complaints of the &s;everity of impo&s;ing oaths, and began to &s;et on foot the &s;ame practices now, when they had it in their power to do it. But how unbecoming &s;oever this rigour might be in laymen, it was certainly much more indecent when mana|ged by Clergy-men. And the &s;upremacy which was now turned again&s;t the Pre&s;byterians was, not long after this, laid much hea|vier on the Bi&s;hops them&s;elves: And then they de&s;ired an expla|nation, as much as the Pre&s;byterians did now, but could not ob|tain it.</P>
<P>The Parliament was not &s;atisfied with this oath: For they ap|prehended, that many would infer, that, &s;ince it came from <HI>En|gland,</HI> it ought to be under&s;tood in the publick and e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;en&s;e of the words that was pa&s;s'd there, both in an article of doc|trine and in an act of Parliament. Therefore another oath was likewi&s;e taken from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pattern, of abjuring the Cove|nant; both the League and the national Covenant. It is true, this was only impo&s;ed on men in the magi&s;tracy, or in publick employments. By it all the Pre&s;byterians were turned out: For this oath was decried by the Mini&s;ters as little le&s;s than open apo&s;tacy from God, and a throwing off their bapti&s;mal Co|venant.</P>
<P>The main bu&s;ine&s;s of this &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, now that Epi&s;|copacy <NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$ a|bout an act $span$.</NOTE> was &s;ettled, and the&s;e oaths were enacted, was the pa&s;&s;ing of the act of indemnity. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> had obtained of the King an in&s;truction to con&s;ent to the fining of the chief offenders, or to other puni&s;hments not extending to life. This was intended to enrich him and his party, &s;ince all the rich and great offenders would be &s;truck with the terror of this, and choo&s;e rather to make him a good pre&s;ent, than to be fined on record, as guilty per&s;ons. This matter was debated at the Coun|cil
<PB N="147" REF="162">
in <HI>Whitehall.</HI> The Earls of <HI>Landerdale</HI> and <HI>Crawford</HI> argu|ed again&s;t it. They &s;aid, the King had granted a full indemnity in <HI>England,</HI> out of which none were excepted but the regicides: It &s;eemed therefore an unkind and an unequal way of proceed|ing towards <HI>Scotland,</HI> that had merited eminently at the King's hands ever &s;ince the year 1648, and &s;uffered much for it, that the one Kingdom &s;hould not have the &s;ame mea&s;ure of grace and pardon that was granted in the other. The Earl of <HI>Midletonn</HI> an&s;wered, that all he de&s;ired was in favour of the loyal party in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who were undone by their adhering to the King: The revenue of the Crown was too &s;mall, and too much charged, to re|pair their lo&s;&s;es: So the King had no other way to be ju&s;t to them, but to make their enemies pay for their rebellion. Some plau|&s;ible limitations were offered to the fines to which any &s;hould be condemned; as that they &s;hould be only for offences commit|ted &s;ince the year 1650, and that no man &s;hould be fined in a|bove a year's rent of his e&s;tate. The&s;e were agreed to. So he had an in&s;truction to pa&s;s an act of indemnity, with a power of fining re&s;train'd to the&s;e rules. There was one Sir <HI>George Macken|zie,</HI> &s;ince made Lord <HI>Tarbot</HI> and Earl of <HI>Cromarty,</HI> a young man of great vivacity of parts, but full of ambition, and had the art to recommend him&s;elf to all &s;ides and parties by turns, and has made a great figure in that country now above fifty years. He had great notions of vertue and religion: But they were only notions, at lea&s;t they have not had great effect on him&s;elf at all times. He became now the Earl of <HI>Midletonn</HI>'s chief favourite. <HI>Primero&s;e</HI> was grown rich and cautious: And his maxim having always been, that, when he apprehended a change, he ought to lay in for it by courting the &s;ide that was depre&s;&s;ed, that &s;o in the next turn he might &s;ecure friends to him&s;elf, he began to think that the Earl of <HI>Midletonn</HI> went too fa&s;t to hold out long. He had often advi&s;ed him to manage the bu&s;ine&s;s of re&s;toring Epi&s;copacy in a &s;low progre&s;s. He had formed a &s;cheme, by which it would have been the work of &s;even years. But the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI>'s heat, and <HI>Sharp</HI>'s vehemence, &s;poiled all his project. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> after his own di&s;grace &s;aid often to him, that his advices had been always wi&s;e and faithful: But he thought Princes were more &s;en&s;ible of &s;ervices, and more apt to reflect on them, and to reward them, than he found they were.</P>
<P>When the &s;ettlement of Epi&s;copacy was over, the next care was <NOTE PLACE="marg">It was d$span$ that &s;ome might be incapaci|$$ted.</NOTE> to prepare the act of indemnity. Some propo&s;ed, that, be&s;ides the power of fining, they &s;hould move the King, that he would con&s;ent to an in&s;truction, impowering them likewi&s;e to put &s;ome under an incapacity to hold any publick tru&s;t. This had never
<PB N="148" REF="163">
been propo&s;ed in publick. But the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> pretended, that many of the be&s;t affected of the Parliament had propo&s;ed it in private to him&s;elf. So he &s;ent the Lord <HI>Tarbot</HI> up to the King with two draughts of an act of indemnity, the one containing an exception of &s;ome per&s;ons to be fined, and the other containing likewi&s;e a clau&s;e for the incapacitating of &s;ome, not exceeding twelve, from all publick tru&s;t. He was ordered to lay both be|fore the King: The one was penned according to the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI>'s in&s;tructions: The other was drawn at the de&s;ire of the Parliament, for which he prayed an in&s;truction, if the King thought fit to approve of it. The Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> had no apprehen&s;ion of any de&s;ign again&s;t him&s;elf in the motion. So he made no objection to it. And an in&s;truction was drawn, impow|ering the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> to pa&s;s an act with that clau&s;e. <HI>Tar|bot</HI> was then much con&s;idered at Court, as one of the mo&s;t ex|traordinary men that <HI>Scotland</HI> had produced, and was the better liked, becau&s;e he was looked on as the per&s;on that the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> intended to &s;et up in the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s room, who was then &s;o much hated, that nothing could have pre&s;erved him but the cour&s;e that was taken to ruine him. So Lord <HI>Tar|bot</HI> went back to <HI>Scotland.</HI> And the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Newburgh</HI> went down with him, by who&s;e wild and ungo|verned extravagancies the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI>'s whole conduct fell under &s;uch an univer&s;al odium, and &s;o much contempt, that, as his own ill management forced the King to put an end to his mini&s;try, &s;o he could not have &s;erved there much longer with any reputation.</P>
<P>One in&s;tance of unu&s;ual &s;everity was, that a letter of the Lord <HI>Lorn</HI>'s to the Lord <HI>Duffus</HI> was intercepted, in which he did a little too plainly, but very truly, complain of the practices of his enemies in endeavouring to po&s;&s;e&s;s the King again&s;t him by many lies: But he &s;aid, he had now di&s;covered them, and had defeated them, and had gained the per&s;on upon whom the chief among them depended. This was the Earl of <HI>Cla|rendon,</HI> upon whom the Earl of <HI>Berk&s;hire</HI> had wrought &s;o much, that he re&s;olved to oppo&s;e his re&s;toration no more: And for this the Earl of <HI>Berk&s;hire</HI> was to have a thou&s;and pounds. This letter was carried into the Parliament, and complained of as lea&s;ing-making; &s;ince Lord <HI>Lorn</HI> pretended, he had di&s;|covered the lies of his enemies to the King, which was a &s;owing di&s;&s;en&s;ion between the King and his &s;ubjects, and the crea|ting in the King an ill opinion of them. So the Parliament de|&s;ired, the King would &s;end him down to be tried upon it. The King thought the letter very indi&s;creetly writ, but could not &s;ee any thing in it that was criminal. Yet, in compliance with the

de&s;ire of &s;o zealous a Parliament, Lord <HI>Lorn</HI> was &s;ent down up|on his parole: But the King writ po&s;itively to the Earl of <HI>Midle|toun,</HI> not to proceed to the execution of any &s;entence that might pa&s;s upon him. Lord <HI>Lorn</HI> upon his appearance was made a pri&s;oner: And an indictment was brought again&s;t him for lea&s;ing|making. He made no defence: But in a long &s;peech he &s;et out the great provocation he had been under, the many libels that had been printed again&s;t him: Some of the&s;e had been put in the King's own hands, to repre&s;ent him as unworthy of his grace and favour: So, after all that hard u&s;age, it was no won|der, if he had writ with &s;ome &s;harpne&s;s: But he prote&s;ted, he meant no harm to any per&s;on; his de&s;ign being only to pre&s;erve and &s;ave him&s;elf from the malice and lies of others, and not to make lies of any. In conclu&s;ion, he &s;ubmitted to the ju&s;tice of the Parliament, and ca&s;t him&s;elf on the King's mercy. He was upon this condemned to die, as guilty of lea&s;ing-making: And the day of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lorn</HI> con|demned.</NOTE> his execution was left to the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> by the Parliament.</P>
<P>I never knew any thing more generally cried out on than this was, unle&s;s it was the &s;econd &s;entence pa&s;s'd on him twenty years after this, which had more fatal effects, and a more tragical con|clu&s;ion. He was certainly born to be the &s;ignale&s;t in&s;tance in this age of the rigour, or rather of the mockery, of ju&s;tice. All that was &s;aid at this time to excu&s;e the proceeding was, that it was certain his life was in no danger. But &s;ince that depended on the King, it did not excu&s;e tho&s;e who pa&s;s'd &s;o ba&s;e a &s;entence, and left to po&s;terity the precedent of a Parliamentary judgment, by which any man may be condemned for a letter of common news. This was not all the fury with which this matter was dri|ven: For an act was pa&s;s'd again&s;t all per&s;ons, who &s;hould move the King for re&s;toring the children of tho&s;e who were attainted by Parliament; which was an unheard-of re&s;traint on applicati|ons to the King for his grace and mercy. This the Earl of <HI>Midle|toun</HI> al&s;o pa&s;s'd, tho' he had no in&s;truction for it. There was no penalty put in the act: For it was a maxim of the pleaders for prerogative, that the fixing a puni&s;hment was a limitation on the Crown: Whereas an act forbidding any thing, tho' with|out a penalty, made the offenders criminal: And in that ca&s;e they did reckon, that the puni&s;hment was arbitrary; only that it could not extend to life. A Committee was next appointed for &s;etting the fines. They proceeded without any regard to the rules the King had &s;et them. The mo&s;t obnoxious compounded &s;ecretly. No con&s;ideration was had either of mens crimes, or of their e&s;tates: No proofs were brought. Enquiries were not &s;o much as made: But as men were delated, they were marked down
<PB N="150" REF="165">
for &s;uch a fine: And all was tran&s;acted in a &s;ecret Committee. When the li&s;t of the men and of their fines was read in Parlia|ment, exceptions were made to divers; particularly &s;ome who had been under age all the time of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and others abroad. But to every thing of that kind an an&s;wer was made, that there would come a proper time in which every man was to be heard in his own defence: For the meaning of &s;etting the fine was only this, that &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hould have no benefit by the act of indemnity, unle&s;s they paid the fine: Therefore every one that could &s;tand upon his innocence, and renounce the benefit of the indemnity, was thereby free from the fine, which was only his compo&s;ition for the grace and pardon of the act. So all pa&s;s'd in that great hurry.</P>
<P>The other point, concerning the incapacity, was carried far|ther <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some inca|pacitated by ballot</NOTE> than was perhaps intended at fir&s;t; tho' the Lord <HI>Tarbot</HI> a&s;|&s;ured me, he had from the beginning de&s;igned it. It was infu|&s;ed into all people, that the King was weary of the Earl of <HI>Lau|derdale,</HI> but that he could not decently throw him off, and that therefore the Parliament mu&s;t help him with a fair pretence for doing it. Yet others were very apprehen&s;ive, that the King could not approve of a Parliament's falling upon a Mini&s;ter. So Lord <HI>Tarbot</HI> propo&s;ed two expedients. The one was, that no per&s;on &s;hould be named, but that every member &s;hould do it by ballot, and &s;hould bring twelve names in a paper; and that a &s;ecret Com|mittee of three of every F&s;tate &s;hould make the &s;crutiny; and that they, without making any report to the Parliament, &s;hould put tho&s;e twelve names on whom the greater number fell in the act of incapacity; which was to be an act apart, and not made a clau&s;e of the act of indemnity. This was taken from the o&s;tra|ci&s;m in <HI>Athens,</HI> and &s;eemed the be&s;t method in an act of obli|vion, in which all that was pa&s;s'd was to be forgotten: And no &s;eeds of feuds would remain, when it was not &s;o much as known again&s;t whom any one had voted. The other expedient was, that a clau&s;e &s;hould be put in the act, that it &s;hould have no force, and that the names in it &s;hould never be publi&s;hed, unle&s;s the King &s;hould approve of it. By this means it was hoped, that, if the King &s;hould di&s;like the whole thing, yet it would be ea&s;y to &s;often that, by letting him &s;ee how entirely the act was in his power. Emi&s;&s;aries were &s;ent to every Parliament man, directing him how to make his li&s;t, that &s;o the Earls of <HI>Lauderdale, Craw&s;ord,</HI> and Sir <HI>Robert Murray,</HI> might be three of the number. This was managed &s;o carefully, that by a great majority they were three of the incapacitated per&s;ons. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> pa&s;s'd the act, tho' he had no in&s;truction about it in this form.
<PB N="151" REF="166">
The matter was &s;o &s;ecretly carried, that it was not let out till the day before it was done: For they reckoned their &s;ucce&s;s in it was to depend on the &s;ecrecy of it, and in their carrying it to the King, before he &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t it by the Earl of <HI>Lau|derdale,</HI> or his party. So they took great care to vi&s;it the pac|ket, and to &s;top any that &s;hould go to Court po&s;t: And all people were under &s;uch terror, that no courage was left. Only Lord <HI>Lorn</HI> &s;ent one on his own hor&s;es, who was to go on in cro&s;s roads, till he got into <HI>York&s;hire;</HI> for they had &s;ecured every &s;tage to <HI>Dur|ham.</HI> By this means the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> had the news three days before the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> and Lord <HI>Tarbot</HI> got to Court. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King was di&s;|plea&s;ed with this.</NOTE> He carried it pre&s;ently to the King, who could &s;carce believe it. But when he &s;aw by the letters that it was certainly true, he a&s;|&s;ured the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> that he would pre&s;erve him, and never &s;uffer &s;uch a de&s;tructive precedent to pa&s;s. He &s;aid, he looked for no better upon the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI>'s going to <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and his being perpetually drunk there. This mortified the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale;</HI> for it looked like the laying in an excu&s;e for the Earl of <HI>Midletoun.</HI> From the King, by his orders, he went to the Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> and told all to him. He was amazed at it; and &s;aid, that certainly he had &s;ome &s;ecret friend that had got into their confidence, and had per&s;uaded them to do as they had done on de&s;ign to ruine them. But growing more &s;erious, he added, he was &s;ure the King on his own account would take care not to &s;uffer &s;uch a thing to pa&s;s: Otherwi&s;e no man could &s;erve him: If way was given to &s;uch a method of proceeding, he him&s;elf would go out of his dominions as fa&s;t as his gout would &s;uffer him.</P>
<P>Two days after this the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> and Lord <HI>Tarbot</HI> came to Court. They brought the act of incapacity &s;ealed up, together with a letter from the Parliament, magnifying the Earl of <HI>Midle|toun</HI>'s &s;ervices, and another letter &s;igned by ten of the Bi&s;hops, &s;etting forth his zeal for the Church, and his care of them all: And in particular they &s;et out the de&s;ign he was then on, of go|ing round &s;ome of the wor&s;t affected counties to &s;ee the Church e&s;tabli&s;hed in them, as a work that was highly meritorious. At the &s;ame time he &s;ent over the Earl of <HI>Newburgh</HI> to <HI>Ireland,</HI> to engage the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> to repre&s;ent to the King the good effects that they began to feel in that Kingdom from the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI>'s admini&s;tration in <HI>Scotland,</HI> hoping the King would not di&s;courage, much le&s;s change &s;o faithful a mini&s;ter. The King received the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> and Lord <HI>Tarbot</HI> ve|ry coldly. When they delivered the act of incapacity to him, he a&s;&s;ured them, it &s;hould never be open'd by him; and &s;aid, their
<PB N="152" REF="167">
la&s;t actings were like madmen, or like men that were perpetual|ly drunk. Lord <HI>Tarbot</HI> &s;aid, all was yet entire, and in his hands, the act being to live or to die as he plea&s;ed: He magnified the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI>'s zeal in his &s;ervice, and the loyal affections of his Parliament, who had on this occa&s;ion con&s;ulted both the King's &s;afety, and his honour: The incapacity act was only in|tended, to put it out of the power of men, who had been former|ly bad in&s;truments, to be &s;o any more: And even that was &s;ub|mitted by them to the King's judgment. The King heard them patiently, and, without any farther di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ubject, di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed them: So they hoped they had mollified him. But the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> turned the matter upon the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> and Lord <HI>Tarbot,</HI> who had made the King believe that the Par|liament de&s;ired leave to incapacitate &s;ome, whereas no &s;uch de|&s;ire had ever been made in Parliament: And then, after that the King upon that mi&s;repre&s;entation had given way to it, the Par|liament was made believe that the King de&s;ired that &s;ome might be put under that cen&s;ure: So that the abu&s;e had been equally put on both: Honours went by ballot at <HI>Venice:</HI> But puni&s;hments had never gone &s;o, &s;ince the o&s;traci&s;m at <HI>Athens,</HI> which was the fac|tious practice of a jealous Commonwealth, never to be &s;et up as a precedent under a Monarchy: Even the <HI>Athenians</HI> were a&s;ham|ed of it, when <HI>Ari&s;tides,</HI> the ju&s;te&s;t man among them, fell under the cen&s;ure: And they laid it a&s;ide not long after.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> gave up the thing as inexcu&s;able: But <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great pains taken to ex|cu&s;e <HI>Midle|toun.</HI></NOTE> he &s;tudied to pre&s;erve the Earl of <HI>Midletoun.</HI> The change new|ly made in the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> had been managed by him with zeal and &s;ucce&s;s: But tho' it was well begun, yet if the&s;e laws were not maintained by a vigorous execution, the Pre&s;byte|rians, who were quite di&s;pirited by the &s;teddine&s;s of his conduct, would take heart again; e&s;pecially if they &s;aw the Earl of <HI>Lau|derdale</HI> grow upon him, whom they looked on as theirs in his heart: So he prayed the King to forgive one &s;ingle fault, that came after &s;o much merit. He al&s;o &s;ent advices to the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> to go on in his care of e&s;tabli&s;hing the Church, and to get the Bi&s;hops to &s;end up copious accounts of all that he had done. The King ordered him to come up, and to give him an account of the affairs in <HI>Scotland.</HI> But he repre&s;ented the ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity of &s;eeing &s;ome of the laws lately made put in execution: For it was hoped, the King's di&s;plea&s;ure would be allayed, and go off, if &s;ome time could be but gained.</P>
<P>One act pa&s;s'd in the la&s;t Parliament that re&s;tored the rights of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Presby|teriay Mini|&s;ters &s;ileu|ced.</NOTE> patronage, the taking away of which even Pre&s;bytery could not carry till the year 1649, in which they had the Parliament en|tirely
<PB N="153" REF="168">
in their hands. Then the election of Mini&s;ters was put in the Church &s;e&s;&s;ion and the lay elders: So that, from that time all that had been admitted to Churches came in without pre&s;en|tations. One clau&s;e in the act declared all the&s;e incumbents to be unlawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors: Only it indemnified them for what was pa&s;t, and required them before <HI>Michaelma&s;s</HI> to take pre&s;entati|ons from the patrons, who were obliged to give them being de|manded, and to get them&s;elves to be in&s;tituted by the Bi&s;hops; otherwi&s;e their Churches were declared vacant on <HI>Michaelma&s;s</HI> day. This took in all the young and hot men: So the Pre&s;by|terians had many meetings about it, in which they all re&s;olved not to obey the act. They reckoned, the taking in&s;titution from a Bi&s;hop was &s;uch an owning of his authority, that it was a renouncing of all their former principles: Whereas &s;ome few that had a mind to hold their benefices, thought that was only a &s;ecular law for a legal right to their tithes and benefices, and had no relation to their &s;piritual concerns; and therefore they thought they might &s;ubmit to it, e&s;pecially where Bi&s;hops were &s;o mode|rate as to impo&s;e no &s;ub&s;cription upon them, as the greater part were. But the re&s;olution taken by the main body of the Pre&s;by|terians was, to pay no obedience to any of the acts made in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, and to look on, and &s;ee what the State would do. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> was naturally fierce, and that was heightened by the ill &s;tate of his affairs at Court: So he re&s;olved on a punc|tual execution of the law. He and all about him were at this time &s;o con&s;tantly di&s;ordered by high entertainments and other exce&s;&s;es, that, even in the &s;hort intervals between their drunken bouts, they were not cool nor calm enough to con&s;ider what they were doing. He had al&s;o &s;o mean an opinion of the party, that he believed they would comply with any thing rather than loo&s;e their benefices. And therefore he declared, he would execute the law in its utmo&s;t rigour. On the other hand, the heads of the Pre&s;byterians reckoned, that if great numbers were turned out all at once, it would not be po&s;&s;ible to fill their places on the &s;udden; and that the government would be forced to take them in again, if there were &s;uch a vacancy made, that a great part of the nation were ca&s;t de&s;titute, and had no divine &s;ervice in it. For that which all the wi&s;er of the party apprehended mo&s;t was, that the Bi&s;hops would go on &s;lowly, and &s;ingle out &s;ome that were more factious upon particular provocations, and turn them out by degrees, as they had men ready to put in their room; which would have been more in&s;en&s;ible, and more excu&s;able, if indi&s;creet zealots had, as it were, forced cen&s;ures from them. The advice &s;ent over all the countrey, from their leaders who
<PB N="154" REF="169">
had &s;ettled mea&s;ures at <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> was, that they &s;hould do and &s;ay nothing that might give a particular di&s;ta&s;te, but &s;hould look on, and do their duty as long as they were connived at; and that if any proclamation &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued out, commanding them to be &s;ilent, they &s;hould all obey at once. In the&s;e mea|&s;ures both &s;ides were deceived in their expectations. The Bi|&s;hops went to their &s;everal dioce&s;es: And according as the people &s;tood affected they were well or ill received: And they held their &s;ynods every where in <HI>October.</HI> In the northern parts very few &s;tood out: But in the we&s;tern parts &s;carce any came to them. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> went to <HI>Gla&s;cow</HI> before <HI>Michaelma&s;s.</HI> So when the time fixed by the act was pa&s;s'd, and that &s;carce any one in all tho&s;e Counties had paid any regard to it, he called a meet|ing of the Privy Council, that they might con&s;ider what was fit to be done. Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> told me, they were all &s;o drunk that day, that they were not capable of con&s;idering any thing that was laid before them, and would hear of nothing but the executing the law without any relenting or delay. So a procla|mation was i&s;&s;ued out, requiring all who had their livings with|out pre&s;entations, and who had not obeyed the late act, to give over all farther preaching, or &s;erving the cure, and to with|draw from their pari&s;hes immediately: And the military men that lay in the countrey were ordered to pull them out of their pulpits, if they &s;hould pre&s;ume to go on in their functions. This was oppo&s;ed only by Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and Sir <HI>James Lockhart,</HI> father to Sir <HI>William Lockhart.</HI> They repre&s;ented, that the much greater part of the preachers in the&s;e Counties had come into their Churches &s;ince the year 1649; that they were very popular men, both e&s;teemed and beloved of their people: It would be a great &s;candal, if they &s;hould be turned out, and none be ready to be put in their places: And it would not be po&s;&s;ible to find a com|petent number of well qualified men, to fill the many vacancies that this proclamation would make. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> would hear of nothing, but the immediate execution of the law. So the proclamation was i&s;&s;ued out: And upon it above two hundred Churches were &s;hut up in one day: And above one hundred and fifty more were to be turned out for not obeying, and &s;ubmitting to the Bi&s;hops &s;ummons to their &s;ynods. All this was done with|out con&s;idering the con&s;equence of it, or communicating it to the other Bi&s;hops. <HI>Sharp</HI> &s;aid to my &s;elf, that he knew nothing of it; nor did he imagine, that &s;o ra&s;h a thing could have been done, till he &s;aw it in print. He was glad that this was done without his having any &s;hare in it: For by it he was furni&s;hed with &s;omewhat, in which he was no way concerned, upon which
<PB N="155" REF="170">
he might ca&s;t all the blame of all that followed. Yet this was &s;uitable enough to a maxim that he and all that &s;ort of peo|ple &s;et up, that the execution of laws was that by which all go|vernments maintained their &s;trength, as well as their honour. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> was &s;urprized at this extraordinary &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion of the Pre&s;byterians. He had fancied, that the greate&s;t part would have complied, and that &s;ome of the more intractable would have done &s;ome extraordinary thing, to have ju&s;tified the &s;everities he would have exerci&s;ed in that ca&s;e; and was di&s;|appointed both ways. Yet this obedience of a party, &s;o little accu&s;tomed to it, was much magnified at Court. It was &s;aid, that all plied before him: They knew he was &s;teddy: So they &s;aw how nece&s;&s;ary it was not to change the management, if it was really intended to pre&s;erve the Church. Lord <HI>Tarbot</HI> told me, that the King had expre&s;&s;ed to him&s;elf the e&s;teem he had for <HI>Sheldon,</HI> upon the account of the courage that he &s;hewed in the debate concerning the execution of the act of Uniformity at the day prefixed, which was St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s: For &s;ome &s;ugge&s;ted the danger that might ari&s;e, if the act were vigorou&s;ly executed. From thence it &s;eems the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> concluded, the zeal he &s;hewed now would be &s;o acceptable, that all former errours would be forgiven, if he went through with it; as indeed he &s;tuck at nothing. Yet the clamour of putting &s;everal Coun|ties, as it were, under an interdict, was very great. So all en|deavours were u&s;ed to get as many as could be had to fill tho&s;e vacancies. And among others I was much pre&s;&s;ed, both by the Earl of <HI>Glencairn</HI> and the Lord <HI>Tarbot,</HI> to go into any of the vacant Churches that I liked. I was then but nineteen: Yet there is no law in <HI>Scotland</HI> limiting the age of a prie&s;t. And it was upon this account that I was let &s;o far into the &s;ecret of all affairs: For they had &s;uch an imagination of &s;ome &s;ervice I might do them, that they treated me with a very particu|lar freedom and confidence. But I had drunk in the principles of moderation &s;o early, that, tho' I was entirely Epi&s;copal, yet I would not engage with a body of men, that &s;eemed to have the principles and tempers of Inqui&s;itors in them, and to have no regard to religion in any of their proceedings. So I &s;tood upon my youth, and could not be wrought on to go to the we&s;t; tho' the Earl of <HI>Glencairn</HI> offered to carry me with him under his protection.</P>
<P>There was a &s;ort of an invitation &s;ent over the Kingdom, like a huy and cry, to all per&s;ons to accept of benefices in the we&s;t. The livings were generally well endowed, and the par&s;onage hou&s;es were well built, and in good repair: And this drew many very worth|le&s;s
<PB N="156" REF="171">
per&s;ons thither, who had little learning, le&s;s piety, and no &s;ort of di&s;cretion. They came thither with great prejudices again&s;t them, and had many difficulties to wre&s;tle with. The former <NOTE PLACE="marg">A general character of them.</NOTE> incumbents, who were for the mo&s;t part Prote&s;tors, were a grave &s;olemn &s;ort of people. Their &s;pirits were eager, and their tem|pers &s;our: But they had an appearance that created re&s;pect. They were related to the chief families in the countrey, either by blood or marriage; and had lived in &s;o decent a manner, that the Gentry paid great re&s;pect to them. They u&s;ed to vi&s;it their pari&s;hes much, and were &s;o full of the &s;criptures, and &s;o ready at extempore prayer, that from that they grew to practice ex|tempore &s;ermons: For the cu&s;tom in <HI>Scotland</HI> was after dinner or &s;upper to read a chapter in the &s;cripture: And where they hap|pened to come, if it was acceptable, they on the &s;udden expound|ed the chapter. They had brought the people to &s;uch a degree of knowledge, that cottagers and &s;ervants would have prayed extempore. I have often over heard them at it: And, tho' there was a large mixture of odd &s;tuff, yet I have been a&s;toni&s;hed to hear how copious and ready they were in it. Their Mini&s;ters generally brought them about them on the &s;unday nights, where the &s;ermons were talked over; and every one, women as well as men, were de&s;ired to &s;peak their &s;en&s;e and their experience: And by the&s;e means they had a comprehen&s;ion of matters of religion, greater than I have &s;een among people of that &s;ort any where. The preachers went all in one track, of rai&s;ing ob|&s;ervations on points of doctrine out of their text, and proving the&s;e by rea&s;ons, and then of applying tho&s;e, and &s;hewing the u&s;e that was to be made of &s;uch a point of doctrine, both for in&s;truction and terrour, for exhortation and comfort, for trial of them&s;elves upon it, and for furni&s;hing them with proper di|rections and helps: And this was &s;o methodical, that the peo|ple grew to follow a &s;ermon quite through every branch of it. To this &s;ome added, the re&s;olving of doubts concerning the &s;tate they were in, or their progre&s;s or decay in it; which they called ca&s;es of con&s;cience: And the&s;e were taken from what their people &s;aid to them at any time, very oft being under fits of me|lancholy, or vapours, or ob&s;tructions, which, tho' they flowed from natural cau&s;es, were looked on as the work of the &s;pirit of God, and a particular exerci&s;e to them and they fed this di&s;|ea&s;e of weak minds too much. Thus they had laboured very diligently, tho' with a wrong method and wrong notions. But as they lived in great familiarity with their people, and u&s;ed to pray and to talk oft with them in private, &s;o it can hardly be imagined to what a degree they were loved and reverenced by
<PB N="157" REF="172">
them. They kept &s;candalous per&s;ons under a &s;evere di&s;cipline: For breach of &s;abbath, for an oath, or the lea&s;t di&s;order in drun|kenne&s;s, per&s;ons were cited before the Church &s;e&s;&s;ion, that con|&s;i&s;ted of ten or twelve of the chief of the pari&s;h, who with the Mini&s;ter had this care upon them, and were &s;olemnly reproved for it: For fornication they were not only reproved before the&s;e; but there was a high place in the church called the &s;tool or pillar of repentance, where they &s;ate at the times of wor&s;hip for three Lords-day's, receiving admonitions, and making profe&s;&s;ion of repentance on all tho&s;e days; which &s;ome did with many tears, and &s;erious exhortations to all the re&s;t, to take warning by their fall: For adultery they were to &s;it &s;ix months in that place, co|vered with &s;ackcloth. The&s;e things had a grave appearance. Their faults and defects were not &s;o con&s;picuous. They had a ve|ry &s;canty mea&s;ure of learning, and a narrow compa&s;s in it. They were little men, of a very indifferent &s;ize of capacity, and apt to fly out into great exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion and indi&s;cretion. They were &s;ervile, and too apt to fawn upon, and flatter their admirers. They were affected in their deportment, and very apt to cen&s;ure all who differed from them, and to believe and report what|&s;oever they heard to their prejudice. And they were &s;uper&s;titious and haughty. In their &s;ermons they were apt to enlarge on the &s;tate of the pre&s;ent time, and to preach again&s;t the &s;ins of Prin|ces and Courts: A topick that naturally makes men popular. It has an appearance of courage: And the people are glad to hear tho&s;e &s;ins in&s;i&s;ted on, in which they perceive they have no &s;hare, and to believe that all the judgments of God come down by the means and procurement of other mens &s;ins. But their opinions about the independence of the Church and Clergy on the Civil power, and their readine&s;s to &s;tir up the people to tumults and wars, was that which begot &s;o ill an opinion of them at this time in all men, that very few, who were not deeply engaged with them in the&s;e conceits, pitied them much under all the ill u&s;age they now met with. I hope this is no impertinent nor ungrateful di|gre&s;&s;ion. It is a ju&s;t and true account of the&s;e men and tho&s;e times, from which a judicious reader will make good inferences. I will conclude this with a judicious an&s;wer that one of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of them, <HI>Colvil,</HI> who &s;ucceeded <HI>Leightoun</HI> in the Head&s;hip of the College of <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> made to the Earl of <HI>Midletoun,</HI> when he pre&s;s'd him in the point of defen&s;ive arms to tell plainly his opinion, whether they were lawful or not. He &s;aid, the que&s;tion had been often put to him, and he had always declined to an&s;wer it: But to him he plainly &s;aid, he wi&s;hed that Kings and their Mini&s;ters would believe them lawful, and &s;o go|vern
<PB N="158" REF="173">
as men that expect to be re&s;i&s;ted; but he wi&s;hed, that all their &s;ubjects would believe them to be unlawful, and &s;o the world would be at quiet.</P>
<P>I do now return to end the account of the &s;tate of that coun|trey <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prejudices infu&s;ed a|gain&s;t Epi&s;|copacy.</NOTE> at this time. The people were much troubled, when &s;o ma|ny of their Mini&s;ters were turned out. Their Mini&s;ters had, for &s;ome months before they were thus &s;ilenced, been infu&s;ing this into their people, both in publick and private; that all that was de&s;igned in this change of Church government was to de&s;troy the power of godline&s;s, and to give an impunity to vice; that Pre|lacy was a tyranny in the Church, &s;et on by ambitious and cove|tous men, who aimed at nothing but authority and wealth, luxu|ry and idlene&s;s; and that they intended to encourage vice, that they might procure to them&s;elves a great party among the impi|ous and immoral. The people, thus prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;eeing the Earl of <HI>Midletoun,</HI> and all the train that followed him thro' tho&s;e Coun|ties, running into exce&s;&s;es of all &s;orts, and railing at the very ap|pearance of vertue and &s;obriety, were confirmed in the belief of all that their Mini&s;ters had told them. What they had heard concern|ing <HI>Sharp</HI>'s betraying tho&s;e that had employed him, and the other Bi&s;hops, who had taken the Covenant, and had forced it on others, and now preach'd again&s;t it, openly owning that they had in &s;o doing gone again&s;t the expre&s;s dictate of their own con&s;ci|ence, did very much heighten all their prejudices, and fixed them &s;o in them, that it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to conquer them afterwards. All this was out of mea&s;ure increa&s;ed by the new incumbents, who were put in the places of the ejected preachers, and were generally very mean and de&s;picable in all re&s;pects. They were the wor&s;t preachers I ever heard: They were ignorant to a re|proach: And many of them were openly vitious. They were a di&s;grace to their orders, and the &s;acred functions; and were in|deed the dreg and refu&s;e of the northern parts. Tho&s;e of them, who aro&s;e above contempt or &s;candal, were men of &s;uch violent tempers, that they were as much hated, as the others were de&s;pi&s;ed. This was the fatal beginning of re&s;toring Epi&s;copacy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> of which few of the Bi&s;hops &s;eemed to have any &s;en&s;e. <HI>Fair&s;oul,</HI> the mo&s;t concerned, had none at all: For he fell into a paralytick &s;tate, in which he langui&s;hed a year before he died. I have thus opened the fir&s;t &s;ettlement in <HI>Scotland:</HI> Of which I my &s;elf ob&s;erved what was vi&s;ible, and under&s;tood the more &s;ecret tran&s;actions from tho&s;e, who had &s;uch a &s;hare in them, that it was not po&s;&s;ible for them, to mi&s;take them: And I had no rea|&s;on to think they intended to deceive, or mi&s;inform me.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="174">
I will in the next place change the climate, and give as par|ticular an account as I can of the &s;ettlement of <HI>England</HI> both in <NOTE PLACE="marg">The affairs of <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> Church and State: Which, tho' it will be perhaps imperfect, and will in &s;ome parts be out of order, yet I am well a&s;&s;ured it will be found true; having picked it up at &s;everal times, from the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Murray,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> the &s;on of the Lord Chancellour, the Lord <HI>Hollis,</HI> and Sir <HI>Harbottle Grim&s;tone,</HI> who was the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons, under who&s;e protection I lived nine years when I was preacher at the Rolls, he being then Ma&s;ter of the Rolls. From &s;uch hands I could not be mi&s;led, when I laid all together, and con&s;idered what rea&s;on I had to make allowances for the different accounts that diver&s;ity of parties and intere&s;ts may lead men to give, they too ea&s;ily believing &s;ome things, and as ea&s;ily rejecting others, as they &s;tood affected.</P>
<P>After the King came over, no per&s;on in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons had the courage to move the offering propo&s;itions for any limitation of prerogative, or the defining of any doubtful points. All was joy and rapture. If the King had applyed him&s;elf to bu&s;ine&s;s, and had pur&s;ued tho&s;e de&s;igns which he &s;tudied to re|trieve all the re&s;t of his reign, when it was too late, he had pro|bably in tho&s;e fir&s;t tran&s;ports carried every thing that he would have de&s;ired, either as to revenue or power. But he was &s;o giv|en up to plea&s;ure, that he devolved the management of all his affairs on the Earl of <HI>Clarendon;</HI> who, as he had his breeding in the law, &s;o he had all along declared him&s;elf for the ancient liberties of <HI>England,</HI> as well as for the rights of the Crown. A dome&s;tick accident had happened to him, which heightened his zeal for the former. He, when he began to grow eminent in his profe&s;&s;ion, came down to &s;ee his aged father, a gentleman of <HI>Wilt&s;hire:</HI> Who, one day, as they were walking in the field together, told him, that men of his profe&s;&s;ion did often &s;tretch law and prerogative, to the prejudice of the liberty of the &s;ub|ject, to recommend and advance them&s;elves: So he charged him, if ever he grew to any eminence in his profe&s;&s;ion, that he &s;hould never &s;acrifice the laws and liberties of his countrey to his own intere&s;ts, or to the will of a Prince. He repeated this twice: And immediately he fell into a fit of an apoplexy, of which he died in a few hours. This the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> told the Lady <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> who put him often in mind of it: And from her I had it.</P>
<P>He re&s;olved not to &s;tretch the prerogative beyond what it was <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Clarendon</HI> ju&s;t and mo|derate noti|ons.</NOTE> before the wars, and would neither &s;et a&s;ide the Petition of Right,
<PB N="160" REF="175">
nor endeavour to rai&s;e the Courts of the Star Chamber or the High Commi&s;&s;ion again, which could have been ea&s;ily done, if he had &s;et about it: Nor did he think fit to move for the repeal of the act for triennial Parliaments, till other matters were well &s;ettled. He took care indeed to have all the things that were extorted by the long Parliament from King <HI>Charles</HI> I. to be re|pealed. And &s;ince the di&s;pute of the power of the Militia was the mo&s;t important, and the mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted on, he was very ear|ne&s;t to have that clearly determined for the future. But as to all the acts relating to property, or the ju&s;t limitation of the pre|rogative, &s;uch as the matter of the &s;hip-money, the tonnage and poundage, and the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> act, he did not touch on the&s;e. And as for the &s;tanding revenue, 1200000 <HI>l.</HI> a year was all that was a&s;ked: And, tho' it was much more than any of our Kings had formerly, yet it was readily granted. This was to an&s;wer all the ordinary expence of the government. It was believed, that if two millions had been a&s;ked, he could have carried it. But he had no mind to put the King out of the nece&s;&s;ity of hav|ing recour&s;e to his Parliament. The King came afterwards to believe, that he could have rai&s;ed both his authority and revenue much higher, but that he had no mind to carry it farther, or to tru&s;t him too much. Whether all the&s;e things could have been got at that time, or not, is above my conjecture. But this I know, that all the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s enemies after his fall &s;aid, the&s;e things had been ea&s;ily obtained, if he had taken any pains in the mat|ter, but that he him&s;elf had no mind to it: And they infu&s;ed this into the King, &s;o that he believed it, and hated him mortally on that account. And in his difficulties afterwards he &s;aid often, all tho&s;e things might have been prevented, if the Earl of <HI>Cla|rendon</HI> had been true to him.</P>
<P>The King had not been many days at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> when one <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Venner</HI>'s fu|ry.</NOTE> <HI>Venner,</HI> a violent fifth-monarchy man, who thought it was not enough to believe that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was to reign on earth, and to put the &s;aints in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Kingdom, (an opinion that they were all un&s;peakably fond of,) but added to this, that the &s;aints were to take the Kingdom them&s;elves. He gathered &s;ome of the mo&s;t furious of the party to a meeting in <HI>Coleman</HI> &s;treet. There they concerted the day and the manner of their ri&s;ing to &s;et <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> on his Throne, as they called it. But withal they meant to manage the government in his name; and were &s;o for|mal, that they had prepared &s;tandards and colours with their de|vices on them, and furni&s;hed them&s;elves with very good arms. But when the day came, there was but a &s;mall appearance, not exceeding twenty. However they re&s;olved to venture out into
<PB N="161" REF="176">
the &s;treets, and cry out, No King but <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Some of them &s;eemed per&s;uaded that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> would come down, and head them. They &s;coured the &s;treets before them, and made a great progre&s;s. Some were afraid, and all were amazed at this piece of extrava|gance. They killed a great many, but were at la&s;t ma&s;tered by numbers: And were all either killed, or taken and executed. Upon this &s;ome troops of guards were rai&s;ed. And there was a great talk of a de&s;ign, as &s;oon as the Army was di&s;banded, to rai&s;e a force that &s;hould be &s;o cho&s;en and modelled that the King might depend upon it; and that it &s;hould be &s;o con&s;iderable, that there might be no rea&s;on to apprehend new tumults any more. The Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> looked on a while: And, when he &s;aw how this de&s;ign &s;eemed to be entertained and magnified, he en|tred into a very free expo&s;tulation with the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> about it. He &s;aid, they had felt the effects of a military govern|ment, tho' &s;ober and religious, in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s army: He believed vitious and di&s;&s;olute troops would be much wor&s;e: The King would grow fond of them: And they would quickly become in|&s;olent and ungovernable: And then &s;uch men as he was $word$ be only in&s;truments to &s;erve their ends. He &s;aid, he would $word$ look on, and &s;ee the ruin of his countrey begun, and be &s;ilent A white &s;taff &s;hould not bribe him. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> was per&s;uaded he was in the right, and promi&s;ed he would divert the King from any other force than what might be decent to make a &s;hew with, and what might &s;erve to di&s;per&s;e unruly multitudes. The Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> &s;aid, if it went no farther he could bear it; but it would not be ea&s;y to fix &s;uch a number, as would plea&s;e our Princes, and not give jealou&s;y. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> per|&s;uaded the King, that it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to carry him&s;elf with great caution, till the old Army &s;hould be di&s;banded: For, if an ill humour got among them, they knew both their cou|rage and their principles, which the pre&s;ent times had for a while a little &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: Yet upon any ju&s;t jealou&s;y there might be great cau&s;e to fear new and more violent di&s;orders. By the&s;e means the King was &s;o wrought on, that there was no great oc|ca&s;ion given for jealou&s;y. The Army was to be di&s;banded, but in &s;uch a manner, with &s;o much re&s;pect, and &s;o exact an account of arrears, and &s;uch gratuities, that it looked rather to be the di&s;mi&s;&s;ing them to the next opportunity, and a re&s;erving them till there &s;hould be occa&s;ion for their &s;ervice, than a breaking of them. They were certainly the brave&s;t, the be&s;t di&s;ciplined, and the &s;obere&s;t Army that had been known in the&s;e latter ages: Eve|ry &s;oldier was able to do the functions of an officer. The Court was at great quiet, when they got rid of &s;uch a burden, as lay on
<PB N="162" REF="177">
them from the fear of &s;uch a body of men. The guards, and the new troops that were rai&s;ed, were made up of &s;uch of the Army as <HI>Monk</HI> recommended, and an&s;wered for. And with that his great intere&s;t at Court came to a &s;tand. He was little con&s;i|dered afterwards.</P>
<P>In one thing the temper of the nation appeared to be contrary <NOTE PLACE="marg">The trial and executi|on of the Regicides.</NOTE> to &s;evere proceedings: For, tho' the Regicides were at that time odious beyond all expre&s;&s;ion, and the trials and executions of the fir&s;t that &s;uffered were run to by va&s;t crouds, and all people &s;eem|ed plea&s;ed with the &s;ight, yet the odiou&s;ne&s;s of the crime grew at la&s;t to be &s;o much flatten'd by the frequent executions, and mo&s;t of tho&s;e who &s;uffered dying with much firmne&s;s and &s;hew of piety, ju&s;tifying all they had done, not without a &s;eeming joy for their &s;uffering on that account, that the King was advi&s;ed not to proceed farther, at lea&s;t not to have the &s;cene &s;o near the Court as <HI>Charing-cro&s;s.</HI> It was indeed remarkable that <HI>Peters,</HI> a &s;ort of an enthu&s;ia&s;tical buffoon preacher, tho' a very vitious man, who had been of great u&s;e to <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and had been outra|geous in pre&s;&s;ing the King's death with the cruelty and rudene&s;s of an Inqui&s;itor, was the man of them all that was the mo&s;t &s;unk in his &s;pirit, and could not in any &s;ort bear his puni&s;hment. He had neither the hone&s;ty to repent of it, nor the &s;trength of mind to &s;uffer for it as all the re&s;t of them did. He was ob&s;erved all the while to be drinking &s;ome cordial liquors to keep him from faint|ing. <HI>Harri&s;on</HI> was the fir&s;t that &s;uffered. He was a fierce and bloody enthu&s;ia&s;t. And it was believed, that while the army was in doubt, whether it was fitter to kill the King privately, or to bring him to an open trial, that he offered, if a private way was &s;ettled on, to be the man that &s;hould do it. So he was begun with. But, however rea&s;onable this might be in it &s;elf, it had a very ill effect&punc; For he was a man of great heat and re&s;olution, fixed in his princi|ples, and &s;o per&s;uaded of them, that he had never looked after any intere&s;ts of his own, but had oppo&s;ed <HI>Cromwell</HI> when he &s;et up for him&s;elf. He went thro' all the indignities and &s;everities of his execution, in which the letter of the law in ca&s;es of trea&s;on was punctually ob&s;erved, with a calmne&s;s, or rather a chearfulne&s;s, that a&s;toni&s;hed the &s;pectators. He &s;poke very po&s;itively, that what they had done was the cau&s;e and work of God, which he was confident God would own and rai&s;e up again, how much &s;oever it &s;uffered at that time. Upon this a report was &s;pread, and ge|nerally believed, that he &s;aid, he him&s;elf &s;hould ri&s;e again: Tho' the party denied that, and reported the words as I have &s;et them down. One per&s;on e&s;caped, as was reported, merely by his vi|ces: <HI>Henry Martin,</HI> who had been a mo&s;t violent enemy to
<PB N="163" REF="178">
Monarchy. But all that he moved for, was upon <HI>Roman</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> principles. He never entered into matters of Religion, but on de&s;ign to laugh both at them and all morality; for he was both an impious and vitious man. And now in his impri&s;onment he deliver'd him&s;elf up to vice and bla&s;phemy. It was &s;aid, that this helped him to &s;o many friends, that upon that very account he was &s;pared. <HI>John Goodwin</HI> and <HI>Milton</HI> did al&s;o e&s;cape all cen|&s;ure, to the &s;urpri&s;e of all people. <HI>Goodwin</HI> had &s;o often not only ju&s;tified, but magnified the putting the King to death, both in his &s;ermons and books, that few thought he could have been ei|ther forgot or excu&s;ed; for <HI>Peters</HI> and he were the only preachers that &s;poke of it in that &s;train. But <HI>Goodwin</HI> had been &s;o zea|lous an Arminian, and had &s;own &s;uch divi&s;ion among all the &s;ectaries upon the&s;e heads, that it was &s;aid this procured him friends. Upon what account &s;oever it was, he was not cen&s;ured. <HI>Milton</HI> had appeared &s;o boldly, tho' with much wit and great purity and elegancy of &s;tyle, again&s;t <HI>Salma&s;i$s</HI> and others, upon that argument of the putting the King to death, and had di&s;co|vered &s;uch violence again&s;t the late King and all the Royal family, and again&s;t Monarchy, that it was thought a &s;trange omi&s;&s;ion if he was forgot, and an odd &s;train of clemency, if it was intended he &s;hould be forgiven. He was not excepted out of the act of in|demnity. And afterwards he came out of his concealment, and lived many years much vi&s;ited by all &s;trangers, and much ad|mired by all at home for the poems he writ, tho' he was then blind; chiefly that of <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> in which there is a noblene&s;s both of contrivance and execution, that, tho' he affected to write in blank ver&s;e without rhyme, and made many new and rough words, yet it was e&s;teemed the beautifulle&s;t and perfecte&s;t poem that ever was writ, at lea&s;t in our language.</P>
<P>But as the &s;paring the&s;e per&s;ons was much cen&s;ured, &s;o on the other hand the putting Sir <HI>Henry Vane</HI> to death was as much <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vane</HI>'s cha|racter.</NOTE> blamed: For the declaration from <HI>Breda</HI> being full for an in|demnity to all, except the Regicides, he was comprehended in that; &s;ince, tho' he was for changing the government, and de|po&s;ing the King, yet he did not approve of the putting him to death, nor of the force put on the Parliament, but did for &s;ome time, while the&s;e things were acted, withdraw from the &s;eene. This was &s;o repre&s;ented by his friends, that an addre&s;s was made by both Hou&s;es on his behalf, to which the King gave a favoura|ble an&s;wer, tho' in general words. So he reckoned that he was &s;afe, that being equivalent to an act of Parliament, tho' $word$ wan|ted the nece&s;&s;ary forms. Yet the great &s;hare he had in the at|tainder
<PB N="164" REF="179">
of the Earl <HI>Strafford,</HI> and in the whole turn of affairs to the total change of government, but above all the great opini|on that was had of his parts and capacity to embroil matters again, made the Court think it was nece&s;&s;ary to put him out of the way. He was naturally a very fearful man: This one who knew him well told me, and gave me eminent in&s;tances of it. He had a head as darkened in his notions of religion, as his mind was clouded with fear: For tho' he &s;et up a form of religion in a way of his own, yet it con&s;i&s;ted rather in a withdrawing from all other forms, than in any new or particular opinions or forms; from which he and his party were called Seekers, and &s;eemed to wait for &s;ome new and clearer manife&s;tations. In the&s;e meetings he preached and prayed often him&s;elf, but with &s;o peculiar a dark|ne&s;s, that tho' I have &s;ometimes taken pains to &s;ee if I could find out his meaning in his works, yet I could never reach it. And &s;ince many others have &s;aid the &s;ame, it may be rea&s;onable to believe he hid &s;omewhat that was a nece&s;&s;ary key to the re&s;t. His friends told me, he leaned to <HI>Origen</HI>'s notion of an univer&s;al &s;alvation of all, both of devils and the damned, and to the doc|trine of pre-exi&s;tence. When he &s;aw his death was de&s;igned, he compo&s;ed him&s;elf to it, with a re&s;olution that &s;urpri&s;ed all who knew how little of that was natural to him. Some in&s;tances of this were very extraordinary, tho' they cannot be mentioned with de|cency. He was beheaded on <HI>Tower-Hill,</HI> where a new and ve|ry <NOTE PLACE="marg">And execu|tion.</NOTE> indecent practice was begun. It was ob&s;erved, that the dying &s;peeches of the Regicides had left impre&s;&s;ions on the hearers, that were not at all to the advantage of the government. So &s;trains of a peculiar nature being expected from him, to prevent that, drummers were placed under the &s;caffold, who as &s;oon as he be|gan to &s;peak of the publick, upon a &s;ign given, &s;truck up with their drums. This put him in no di&s;order. He de&s;ired they might be &s;topped, for he under&s;tood what was meant by it. Then he went thro' his devotions. And, as he was taking leave of tho&s;e about him, he happening to &s;ay &s;omewhat with relati|on to the times, the drums &s;truck up a &s;econd time: So he gave over, and died with &s;o much compo&s;edne&s;s, that it was general|ly thought, the government had lo&s;t more than it had gained by his death.</P>
<P>The act of indemnity pa&s;s'd with very few exceptions; at which <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King gave him&s;elf up to his p$$a&s;ures</NOTE> the Cavaliers were highly di&s;&s;atisfied, and made great complaints of it. In the di&s;po&s;al of offices and places, as it was not po&s;&s;i|ble to gratify all, &s;o there was little regard had to mens merits or &s;ervices. The King was determined to mo&s;t of the&s;e by the ca|bal that met at Mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>Palmer</HI>'s lodgings. And tho' the Earl of
<PB N="165" REF="180">
<HI>Clarendon</HI> did often prevail with the King to alter the re&s;oluti|ons taken there, yet he was forced to let a great deal go that he did not like. He would never make applications to Mi&s;tre&s;s <HI>Pal|mer,</HI> nor let any thing pa&s;s the &s;eal in which &s;he was named, as the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> would never &s;uffer her name to be in the Trea&s;ury books. Tho&s;e vertuous Mini&s;ters thought it became them, to let the world &s;ee that they did not comply with the King in his vices. But whether the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> &s;poke &s;o freely to the King about his cour&s;e of life, as was given out, I cannot tell. When the Cavaliers &s;aw, they had not that &s;hare in places that they expected, they complained of it &s;o highly, that the Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> to excu&s;e the King's pa&s;&s;ing them by, was apt to beat down the value they &s;et on their &s;ervices. This laid the foundation of an implacable hatred in many of them, that was compleated by the extent and comprehen&s;ivene&s;s of the act of indemnity, which cut off their hopes of being re-imbur&s;ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The act of indemnity maintained.</NOTE> out of the fines, if not the confi&s;cations of tho&s;e, who had during the cour&s;e of the wars been on the Parliament's &s;ide. It is true, the fir&s;t Parliament, called, by way of derogation, the Conven|tion, had been too much on that &s;ide not to &s;ecure them&s;elves and their friends. So they took care to have the mo&s;t comprehen|&s;ive words put in it, that could be thought of. But when the new Parliament was called a year after, in which there was a de|&s;ign to &s;et a&s;ide the act of indemnity, and to have brought in a new one, the King did &s;o po&s;itively in&s;i&s;t on his adhering to the act of indemnity, that the de&s;ign of breaking into it was laid a&s;ide. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> owned it was his coun&s;el. Acts or promi&s;es of indemnity, he thought, ought to be held &s;acred: A fidelity in the ob&s;ervation of them was the only foundation, upon which any government could hope to quiet &s;editions or civil wars: And if people once thought, that tho&s;e promi&s;es were only made to deceive them, without an intention to ob&s;erve them religiou&s;ly, they would never for the future hearken to any treaty. He often &s;aid, it was the making tho&s;e promi&s;es had brought the King home, and it was the keeping them mu&s;t keep him at home. So that whole work from beginning to the end was entirely his. The angry men, that were thus di&s;appointed of all their hopes, made a je&s;t of the title of it, <HI>An act of obli|vion and of indemnity;</HI> and &s;aid, the King had pa&s;s'd an act of oblivion for his friends, and of indemnity for his enemies. To load the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> the more, it was given out that he advi&s;ed the King to gain his enemies, &s;ince he was &s;ure of his friends by their principles. With this he was often charged, tho' he always denied it. Whether the King fa&s;tened it upon him
<PB N="166" REF="181">
after he had di&s;graced him, to make him the more odious, I cannot tell. It is certain, the King &s;aid many very hard things of him, for which he was much blamed: And in mo&s;t of them he was but little believed.</P>
<P>It was natural for the King upon his Re&s;toration to look out for a proper marriage. And it was &s;oon ob&s;erved, that he was re&s;olved not to marry a Prote&s;tant. He pretended a contempt <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's marriage.</NOTE> of the <HI>Germans,</HI> and of the northern Crowns. <HI>France</HI> had no &s;i&s;ter. He had &s;een the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI>'s daughters, and liked none of them. <HI>Spain</HI> had only two Infantas: And as the elde&s;t was married to the King of <HI>France,</HI> the &s;econd was to go to <HI>Vienna.</HI> So the Hou&s;e of <HI>Portugal</HI> only remained, to furni&s;h him a wife, among the crowned heads. <HI>Monk</HI> began to hearken to a motion made him for this by a <HI>Jew,</HI> that managed the con|cerns of <HI>Portugal,</HI> which were now given for lo&s;t, &s;ince they were abandoned by <HI>France</HI> by the treaty of the <HI>Pyrenees;</HI> in which it appears by Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI>'s letters, that he did entirely deliver up their concerns; which was imputed to his de&s;ire to plea&s;e the Queen-mother of <HI>France,</HI> who, being a daughter of <HI>Spain,</HI> own|ed her&s;elf &s;till to be in the intere&s;ts of <HI>Spain</HI> in every thing in which <HI>France</HI> was not concerned, for in that ca&s;e &s;he pretended &s;he was true to the Crown of <HI>France.</HI> And this was the true &s;e|cret of Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI>'s carrying on that war &s;o feebly as he did, to gratify the Queen-mother on the one hand, and his own covetou&s;ne&s;s on the other: For the le&s;s publick expence was made, he had the greater occa&s;ions of enriching him&s;elf, which was all he thought on. The <HI>Portugueze</HI> being thus, as they thought, ca&s;t off by <HI>France,</HI> were very apprehen&s;ive of falling under the <HI>Ca&s;tillians,</HI> who, how weak &s;oever they were in oppo&s;ition to <HI>France,</HI> yet were like to be too hard for them, when they had nothing el&s;e on their hands. So, va&s;t offers were made, if the King would marry their Infanta, and take them under his protec|tion. <HI>Monk</HI> was the more encouraged to entertain the propo&s;iti|on, becau&s;e &s;ome pretended, that, in the beginning of the war of <HI>Portugal,</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> had entred into a negotiation for a a marriage between his &s;on and this Infanta. And the venerati|on paid his memory was then &s;o high, that every thing he had projected was e&s;teemed &s;acred. <HI>Monk</HI> promi&s;ed to &s;erve the in|tere&s;ts of <HI>Portugal:</HI> And that was, as Sir <HI>Robert Southwell</HI> told me, the fir&s;t &s;tep made in that matter. Soon after the King came into <HI>England,</HI> an emba&s;&s;y of congratulation came from thence, with orders to negotiate that bu&s;ine&s;s. The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Em|ba&s;&s;ador, who had a preten&s;ion of merit from the King in be|half
<PB N="167" REF="182" MS="Y">
of that Crown, &s;ince they had received and entertained him at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> when <HI>France</HI> had thrown him off, &s;et him&s;elf much again&s;t this match: And among other things affirmed, that the Infanta was incapable of having children. But this was little con|&s;idered. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are not very &s;crupulous in affirming any thing that &s;erves their ends: And this marriage was like to &s;ecure the Kingdom of <HI>Portugal.</HI> So it was no wonder that he oppo&s;ed it: And little regard was had to all that he &s;aid to break it.</P>
<P>At this time Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fouquet</HI> was gaining an a&s;cendant in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">An alliance propo&s;ed from <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> coun&s;els of <HI>France,</HI> Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> falling then into a lan|gui&s;hing, of which he died a year after. He &s;ent one over to the King with a project of an alliance between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>En|gland.</HI> He was addre&s;&s;ed fir&s;t to the Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> to whom he enlarged on all the heads of the &s;cheme he had brought, of which the match with <HI>Portugal</HI> was a main article. And, to make all go down the better, <HI>Fouquet</HI> de&s;ired to enter into a particu|lar friend&s;hip with the Earl of <HI>Clarendon;</HI> and &s;ent him the offer of 10000 <HI>l,</HI> and a&s;&s;ured him of the renewing the &s;ame pre&s;ent every year. The Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> told him, he would lay all that related to the King faithfully before him, and give him his an&s;wer in a little time: But for what related to him&s;elf, he &s;aid, he &s;erved a great and bountiful ma&s;ter, who knew well how to &s;upport and reward his &s;ervants: He would ever &s;erve him faith|fully; and, becau&s;e he knew he mu&s;t &s;erve tho&s;e from whom he accepted the hire, therefore he rejected the offer with great indignation. He laid before the King the heads of the propo|&s;ed alliance, which required much con&s;ultation. But in the next place he told both the King and his brother what had been of|fered to him&s;elf. They both advi&s;ed him to accept of it. Why, &s;aid he, have you a mind that I &s;hould betray you? The King an&s;wered, he knew nothing could corrupt him. Then, &s;aid he, you know me better than I do my &s;elf: For if I take the money I &s;hall find the &s;weet of it, and &s;tudy to have it continued to me by de&s;erving it. He told them, how he had rejected the offer; and very &s;eriou&s;ly warned the King of the danger he &s;aw he might fall into, if he &s;uffered any of tho&s;e, who &s;erved him, to be once pen&s;ioners to other Princes: Tho&s;e pre&s;ents were made only to bia&s;s them in their coun&s;els, and to di&s;cover &s;ecrets by their means: And if the King gave way to it, the taking mo|ney would &s;oon grow to a habit, and &s;pread like an infection thro' the whole Court.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="183">
As the motion for the match with <HI>Portugal</HI> was carried on, an incident of an extraordinary nature happened in the Court. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s daughter, being with child, and near <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s marriage.</NOTE> her time, called upon the Duke of <HI>York</HI> to own his marriage with her. She had been maid of honour to the Prince&s;s Royal: And the Duke, who was even to his old age of an amorous di&s;po&s;iti|tion, tried to gain her to comply with his de&s;ires. She mana|ged the matter with &s;o much addre&s;s, that in conclu&s;ion he mar|ried her. Her father did very &s;olemnly prote&s;t, that he knew nothing of the matter, till now that it broke out. The Duke thought to have &s;haken her from claiming it by great promi&s;es, and as great threatnings. But &s;he was a woman of a great &s;pirit. She &s;aid, &s;he was his wife, and would have it known that &s;he was &s;o, let him u&s;e her afterwards as he plea&s;ed. Many di&s;|cour&s;es were &s;et about upon this occa&s;ion. But the King ordered &s;ome Bi&s;hops and Judges to peru&s;e the proofs &s;he had to produce: And they reported that, according to the doctrine of the Go&s;|pel, and the law of <HI>England,</HI> it was a good marriage. So it was not po&s;&s;ible to break it, but by trying how far the matter could be carried again&s;t her, for marrying a per&s;on &s;o near the King without his leave. The King would not break with the Earl of <HI>Clarendon:</HI> And &s;o he told his brother, he mu&s;t drink as he brew|ed, and live with her whom he had made his wife. All the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s enemies rejoyced at this: For they reckoned, how much &s;oever it &s;eemed to rai&s;e him at pre&s;ent, yet it would rai&s;e envy &s;o high again&s;t him, and make the King &s;o jealous of him, as being more in his brother's intere&s;ts than in his own, that they looked on it as that which would end in his ruine. And he him&s;elf thought &s;o, as his &s;on told me: For, as &s;oon as he knew of it, and when he &s;aw his &s;on lifted up with it, he prote&s;ted to him, that he knew nothing of the matter, till it broke out; but added, that he looked on it, as that which mu&s;t be all their ruine &s;ooner or later.</P>
<P>Upon this I will digre&s;s a little to give an account of the Duke's character, whom I knew for &s;ome years &s;o particularly, that I <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke's character.</NOTE> can &s;ay much upon my own knowledge. He was very brave in his youth, and &s;o much magnified by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Turenne,</HI> that, till his marriage le&s;&s;ened him he really clouded the King, and pa&s;s'd for the &s;uperior genius. He was naturally candid and &s;in|cere, and a firm friend, till affairs and his religion wore out all his fir&s;t principles and inclinations. He had a great de&s;ire to under&s;tand affairs: And in order to that he kept a con&s;tant jour|nal of all that pa&s;s'd, of which he &s;hewed me a great deal.
<PB N="169" REF="184">
The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> gave me once a &s;hort but &s;evere cha|racter of the two brothers. It was the more &s;evere, becau&s;e it was true: The King (he &s;aid) could &s;ee things if he would, and the Duke would &s;ee things if he could. He had no true judg|ment, and was &s;oon determined by tho&s;e whom he tru&s;ted: But he was ob&s;tinate again&s;t all other advices. He was bred with high notions of the Kingly authority, and laid it down for a max|im, that all who oppo&s;ed the King were rebels in their hearts. He was perpetually in one amour or other, without being very nice in his choice: Upon which the King &s;aid once, he believed his brother had his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es given him by his Prie&s;ts for penance. He gave me this account of his changing his religion: When he e&s;caped out of the hands of the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who had the charge of his education tru&s;ted to him by the Parlia|ment, and had u&s;ed him with great re&s;pect, all due care was taken, as &s;oon as he got beyond &s;ea, to form him to a &s;trict adherence to the Church of <HI>England:</HI> Among other things much was &s;aid of the authority of the Church, and of the tra|dition from the Apo&s;tles in &s;upport of Epi&s;copacy: So that, when he came to ob&s;erve that there was more rea&s;on to &s;ubmit to the Catholick Church than to one particular Church, and that other traditions might be taken on her word, as well as Epi&s;copacy was received among us, he thought the &s;tep was not great, but that it was very rea&s;onable to go over to the Church of <HI>Rome:</HI> And Doctor <HI>Steward</HI> having taught him to believe a real but un|conceivable pre&s;ence of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in the Sacrament, he thought this went more than half way to tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. He &s;aid, that a Nun's advice to him to pray every day, that, if he was not in the right way, God would &s;et him right, did make a great impre&s;&s;ion on him. But he never told me when or where he was reconciled. He &s;uffered me to &s;ay a great deal to him on all the&s;e heads. I &s;hewed the difference between &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience in matters of order and indifferent things, and an im|plicite &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from the belief of infallibility. I al&s;o &s;hewed him the difference between a &s;peculation of a mode of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s pre&s;ence, when it re&s;ted in an opinion, and an adoration found|ed on it: Tho' the opinion of &s;uch a pre&s;ence was wrong, there was no great harm in that alone: But the adoration of an undue object was idolatry. He &s;uffered me to talk much and often to him on the&s;e heads. But I plainly &s;aw, it made no impre&s;&s;ion: And all that he &s;eemed to intend by it was, to make u&s;e of me as an in&s;trument to &s;often the aver&s;ion that people began to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with to him. He was naturally eager and revengeful: And was again&s;t the taking off any that &s;et up in an oppo&s;ition
<PB N="170" REF="185">
to the mea&s;ures of the Court, and who by that means grew po|pular in the Hou&s;e of Commons. He was for rougher methods. He continued for many years di&s;&s;embling his religion, and &s;eemed zealous for the Church of <HI>England:</HI> But it was chiefly on de&s;ign to hinder all propo&s;itions that tended to unite us among our &s;elves. He was a frugal Prince, and brought his Court into method and magnificence: For he had 100000 <HI>l.</HI> a year allowed him. He was made High Admiral: And he came to under&s;tand all the concerns of the &s;ea very particularly. He had a very able Secretary about him, Sir <HI>William Coventry;</HI> a man of great notions and eminent vertues, the be&s;t Speaker in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and capable of bearing the chief mini&s;try, as it was once thought he was ve|ry near it. The Duke found, all the great &s;eamen had a deep tinc|ture from their education: They both hated Popery, and loved liberty: They were men of &s;evere tempers, and kept good di&s;ci|pline. But in order to the putting the fleet into more confident hands, the Duke began a method of &s;ending pages of honour, and other young per&s;ons of quality, to be bred to the &s;ea. And the&s;e were put in command, as &s;oon as they were capable of it, if not &s;ooner. This di&s;couraged many of the old &s;eamen, when they &s;aw in what a channel advancement was like to go; who upon that left the &s;ervice, and went and commanded merchant|men. By this means the vertue and di&s;cipline of the navy is much lo&s;t. It is true, we have a breed of many gallant men, who do di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves in action. But it is thought, the Nation has &s;uffered much by the vices and di&s;orders of tho&s;e Captains, who have ri&s;en by their quality, more than by merit or &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The Duche&s;s of <HI>York</HI> was a very extraordinary woman. She <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duch|e&s;s's charac|ter.</NOTE> had great knowledge, and a lively &s;en&s;e of things. She &s;oon under&s;tood what belonged to a Prince&s;s; and took &s;tate on her rather too much. She writ well; and had begun the Duke's life, of which &s;he &s;hewed me a volume. It was all drawn from his journal: And he intended to have employed me in carrying it on. She was bred to great &s;trictne&s;s in religion, and practi&s;ed &s;ecret confe&s;&s;ion. <HI>Morley</HI> told me, he was her confe&s;&s;or. She began at twelve years old, and continued under his direction, till, upon her father's di&s;grace, he was put from the Court. She was generous and friendly; but was too &s;evere an enemy.</P>
<P>The King's third brother, the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> was of a <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI>'s character.</NOTE> temper different from his two brothers. He was active, and loved bu&s;ine&s;s, was apt to have particular friend&s;hips; and had an in&s;inuating temper, which was generally very accept|able. The King loved him much better than the Duke of <HI>York.</HI>
<PB N="171" REF="186">
But he was unea&s;y, when he &s;aw there was no po&s;t left for him, &s;ince <HI>Monk</HI> was General. So he &s;poke to the Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> that he might be made Lord Trea&s;urer. But he told him, it was a po&s;t below his dignity. He would not be put off with that: For he could not bear an idle life, nor to &s;ee his brother at the head of the Fleet, when he him&s;elf had neither bu&s;ine&s;s nor de|pendence. But the mirth and entertainments of that time rai&s;|ed his blood &s;o high, that he took the &s;mall pox; of which he died, much lamented by all, but mo&s;t particularly by the King, who was never in his whole life &s;een &s;o much troubled, as he was on that occa&s;ion. Tho&s;e, who would not believe he had much tenderne&s;s in his nature, imputed this rather to his jealou|&s;y of the brother that &s;urvived, &s;ince he had now lo&s;t the only per&s;on that could ballance him. Not long after him the Prin|ce&s;s Royal died likewi&s;e of the &s;mall pox; but was not much lamented. She had lived in her widowhood for &s;ome years with great reputation, kept a decent Court, and &s;upported her brothers very liberally; and lived within bounds. But her mother, who had the art of making her&s;elf believe any thing &s;he had a mind to, upon a conver&s;ation with the Queen Mother of <HI>France,</HI> fan|cied the King of <HI>France</HI> might be inclined to marry her. So &s;he writ to her to come to <HI>Paris.</HI> In order to that, &s;he made an equipage far above what &s;he could &s;upport. So &s;he ran her|&s;elf into debt, &s;old all her jewels, and &s;ome e&s;tates that were in her power as her &s;on's guardian; and was not only di&s;ap|pointed of that vain expectation, but fell into &s;ome misfortunes, that le&s;&s;ened the reputation &s;he had formerly lived in. Upon her death it might have been expected, both in ju&s;tice and gra|titude, that the King would in a mo&s;t particular manner have taken her &s;on, the young Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> into his protection. But he fell into better hands: For his grandmother became his guardian, and took care both of his e&s;tate and his education.</P>
<P>Thus two of the branches of the Royal family were cut off <NOTE PLACE="marg">The pro&s;|pect of the Royal fami|ly much c$anged.</NOTE> &s;oon after the Re&s;toration. And &s;o little do the events of things an&s;wer the fir&s;t appearances, that a Royal family of three Prin|ces and two Prince&s;&s;es, all young and graceful per&s;ons, that promi&s;ed a numerous i&s;&s;ue, did moulder away &s;o fa&s;t, that now, while I am writing, all is reduced to the per&s;on of the Queen, and the Duche&s;s of <HI>Savoy.</HI> The King had a very numerous i&s;&s;ue, tho' none by his Queen. The Duke had by both his wives, and &s;ome irregular amours, a very numerous i&s;&s;ue. And the pre&s;ent Queen has had a mo&s;t fruitful marriage as to i&s;&s;ue, tho' none of them &s;urvive.

diver&s;ion of the <HI>French</HI> Court, that &s;he was glad to go thither again to be married to the King's Brother.</P>
<P>As the treaty with <HI>Portugal</HI> went on, <HI>France</HI> did engage in the concerns of that Crown, tho' they had by treaty promi&s;ed <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Schomberg</HI> went thro' <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Portugal.</HI></NOTE> the contrary to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> To excu&s;e their perfidy, Count <HI>Schomberg,</HI> a <HI>German</HI> by birth, and a Calvini&s;t by his religion, was ordered to go thither, as one prevailed with by the <HI>Portugal</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, and not as &s;ent over by the orders of the Court of <HI>France.</HI> He pa&s;s'd thro' <HI>England</HI> to concert with the King the matters of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and the &s;upply that was to be &s;ent thither from <HI>England.</HI> He told me, the King had admitted him into great familiarities with him at <HI>Paris.</HI> He had known him fir&s;t at the <HI>Hague:</HI> For he was the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s particular favourite; but had &s;o great a &s;hare in the la&s;t violent actions of his life, &s;eizing the States, and in the attempt upon <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> that he left the &s;ervice upon his death; and gained &s;o great a reputa|tion in <HI>France,</HI> that, after the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> and <HI>Turenne,</HI> he was thought the be&s;t General they had. He had much free di&s;|cour&s;e with the King, tho' he found his mind was &s;o turned to mirth and plea&s;ure, that he &s;eemed &s;carce capable of laying any thing to heart. He advi&s;ed him to &s;et up for the head of the Prote&s;tant religion: For tho', he &s;aid to him, he knew he had not much religion, yet his intere&s;ts led him to that. It would keep the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> in a great dependence on him, and make him the umpire of all their affairs; and would procure him great credit with the Huguenots of <HI>France,</HI> and keep that Crown in perpetual fear of him. He advi&s;ed the King to em|ploy the military men that had &s;erved under <HI>Cromwell,</HI> whom he thought the be&s;t officers he had ever &s;een: And he was &s;orry to &s;ee, they were di&s;mi&s;s'd, and that a company of wild young men were tho&s;e the King relied on. But what he pre&s;s'd mo&s;t on the King, as the bu&s;ine&s;s then in agitation, was concerning the &s;ale of <HI>Dunkirk.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> pretended it ought to be re&s;tored to them, &s;ince it was taken from them by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> when they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dunkirk</HI> &s;old to the <HI>Fr$nch.</HI></NOTE> had the King and his brothers in their armies: But that was not much regarded. The <HI>French</HI> pretended, that, by their agreement with <HI>Cromwell,</HI> he was only to hold it, till they had re|payed the charge of the war: Therefore they, offering to lay that down, ought to have the place delivered to them. The King was in no &s;ort bound by this. So the matter under debate was, whe|ther it ought to be kept or &s;old? The military men, who were believed to be corrupted by <HI>France,</HI> &s;aid, the place was not tena|ble; that in time of peace it would put the King to a great charge, and in time of war it would not quit the co&s;t of keep|ing
<PB N="173" REF="188">
it. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> &s;aid, he under&s;tood not tho&s;e mat|ters; but appealed to <HI>Monk</HI>'s judgment, who did po&s;itively advi&s;e the letting it go for the &s;um that <HI>France</HI> offered. To make the bu|&s;ine&s;s go the ea&s;ier, the King promi&s;ed, that he would lay up all the money in the Tower; and that it &s;hould not be touched, but upon extraordinary occa&s;ions. <HI>Schomberg</HI> advi&s;ed, in oppo|&s;ition to all this, that the King &s;hould keep it; for, con&s;idering the naval power of <HI>England,</HI> it could not be taken. He knew, that, tho' <HI>France</HI> &s;poke big, as if they would break with <HI>England</HI> unle&s;s that was delivered up, yet they were far from the thoughts of it. He had con&s;idered the place well; and he was &s;ure it could never be taken, as long as <HI>England</HI> was ma&s;ter of the &s;ea. The holding it would keep both <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> in a depen|dence upon the King. But he was &s;ingular in that opinion. So it was &s;old: And all the money, that was paid for it, was im|mediately &s;quandred away among the mi&s;tri&s;s's creatures.</P>
<P>By this the King lo&s;t his reputation abroad. The Court was <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tangier</HI> a part of the Queen's protion.</NOTE> believed venal. And becau&s;e the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> was in great|e&s;t credit, the blame was ca&s;t chiefly on him; tho' his &s;on a&s;&s;ur|ed me, he kept him&s;elf out of that affair entirely. The co&s;t be&s;towed on that place &s;ince that time, and the great prejudice we have &s;uffered by it, has made that &s;ale to be often reflected on very &s;everely. But it was pretended, that <HI>Tangier,</HI> which was offered as a part of the portion that the Infanta of <HI>Portugal</HI> was to bring with her, was a place of much greater con&s;equence. Its &s;ituation in the map is indeed very eminent. And if <HI>Spain</HI> had been then in a condition to put any re&s;traint on our trade, it had been of great u&s;e to us; e&s;pecially, if the making a mole there had been more practicable, than it proved to be. It was then &s;poken of in the Court in the highe&s;t &s;trains of flattery. It was &s;aid, this would not only give us the entire command of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> trade, but it would be a place of &s;afety for a &s;qua|dron to be always kept there, for &s;ecuring our <HI>We&s;t</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> trade. And &s;uch mighty things were &s;aid of it, as if it had been re&s;erved for the King's reign, to make it as glorious abroad, as it was happy at home: Tho' &s;ince that time we have never been able, neither by force nor treaty, to get ground enough round the town from the <HI>Moors</HI> to maintain the garri&s;on. But every man that was employed there &s;tudied only his own intere&s;t, and how to rob the King. If the money, that was laid out in the mole at different times, had been rai&s;ed all in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as fa&s;t as the work could be carried on, it might have been made a ve|ry very valuable place. But there were &s;o many di&s;continuings, and &s;o many new undertakings, that after an immen&s;e charge
<PB N="174" REF="189">
the Court grew weary of it: And in the year 1638 they &s;ent a &s;qua|dron of &s;hips to bring away the garri&s;on, and to de&s;troy all the works.</P>
<P>To end this matter of the King's marriage with the Infanta of <HI>Portugal</HI> all at once: It was at la&s;t concluded. The Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> went for her, and was the King's proxy in the nuptial ceremony. The King communicated the matter both to the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI> And &s;o &s;trangely were peo|ple changed, that tho' they all had &s;een the mi&s;chievous effects of a Popi&s;h Queen in the former reign, yet not one per&s;on mov|ed again&s;t it in either Parliament, except the Earl of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ilis</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI> who moved for an addre&s;s to the King to marry a Prote&s;tant. He had but one to &s;econd him: So entirely were men run from one extream to another.</P>
<P>When the Queen was brought over, the King met her at <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> in &s;ummer 1662. The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> came to perform the ceremony: But the Queen was bigotted to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of the King's mar|riage.</NOTE> &s;uch a degree, that &s;he would not &s;ay the words of matrimony, nor bear the &s;ight of the Archbi&s;hop. The King &s;aid the words ha&s;tily: And the Archbi&s;hop pronounced them married per&s;ons. Upon this &s;ome thought afterwards to have di&s;&s;olved the marri|age, as a marriage only <HI>de facto,</HI> in which no con&s;ent had been given. But the Duke of <HI>York</HI> told me, they were married by the Lord <HI>Aubigny</HI> according to the <HI>Roman</HI> ritual, and that he him&s;elf was one of the witne&s;&s;es: And he added, that, a few days before he told me this, the Queen had &s;aid to him, that &s;he heard &s;ome intended to call her marriage in que&s;tion; and that, if that was done, &s;he mu&s;t call on him as one of her wit|ne&s;&s;es to prove it. I &s;aw the letter that the King writ to the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> the day after their marriage, by which it ap|peared very plainly that the marriage was con&s;ummated, and that the King was well plea&s;ed with her. The King him&s;elf told me, &s;he had been with child: And <HI>Willis</HI> the great Phy&s;ici|an told Doctor <HI>Lloyd,</HI> from whom I had it, that &s;he had once mi&s;carried of a child, which was &s;o far advanced, that, if it had been carefully look'd to, the &s;ex might have been di&s;tingui&s;hed. But &s;he proved a barren wife, and was a woman of a mean ap|pearance, and of no agreeable temper: So that the King never con&s;idered her much. And &s;he made ever after but a very mean figure. For &s;ome time the King carried things decently, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King lived in an avowed cour&s;e of leudne&s;s.</NOTE> did not vi&s;it his mi&s;tri&s;s openly. But he grew weary of that re|&s;traint; and &s;hook it off &s;o entirely, that he had ever after that mi&s;tri&s;&s;es to the end of his life, to the great &s;candal of the world,
<PB N="175" REF="190">
and to the particular reproach of all that &s;erved about him in the Church. He u&s;ually came from his mi&s;tri&s;&s;es lodgings to Church, even on Sacrament days. He held as it were a court in them: And all his Mini&s;ters made applications to them. On|ly the Earls of <HI>Clarendon</HI> and <HI>Southampton</HI> would never &s;o much as make a vi&s;it to any of them, which was maintaining the decencies of vertue in a very &s;olemn manner. The Lord <HI>Cla|rendon</HI> put the ju&s;tice of the Nation in very good hands; and employed &s;ome who had been on the bench in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s time, the famous Sir <HI>Matthew Hale</HI> in particular.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Ireland</HI> was a harder province. The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> that had been in the rebellion had made a treaty with the Duke <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ettle|ment of <HI>Ire|land.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Ormond,</HI> then acting in the King's name, tho' he had no le|gal power under the Great Seal, the King being then a pri&s;oner. But the Queen-mother got, as they give out, the Crown of <HI>France</HI> to become the guarantee for the performance. By the treaty they were to furni&s;h him with an army, to adhere to the King's intere&s;ts, and &s;erve under the Duke of <HI>Ormond:</HI> And for this they were to be pardoned all that was pa&s;s'd, to have the open exerci&s;e of their religion, and a free admittance into all employments, and to have a free Parliament without the curb of <HI>Poyning</HI>'s law. But after the misfortune at <HI>Dublin,</HI> they &s;et up a &s;upream council again, and refu&s;ed to obey the Duke of <HI>Ormond;</HI> in which the Pope's Nuncio conducted them. After &s;ome di&s;putes, and that the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> &s;aw he could not prevail with them to be commanded by him any more, he left <HI>Ireland.</HI> And <HI>Cromwell</HI> came over, and reduced the whole coun|trey, and made a &s;ettlement of the confi&s;cated e&s;tates, for the pay of the undertakers for the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> war, and of the officers that had &s;erved in it. The King had in his Declaration from <HI>Breda</HI> pro|mi&s;ed to confirm the &s;ettlement of <HI>Ireland.</HI> So now a great de|bate aro&s;e between the native <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ettled in <HI>Ireland.</HI> The former claimed the articles that the Duke of <HI>Or|mond</HI> had granted them. He in an&s;wer to this &s;aid, they had broken fir&s;t on their part, and &s;o had forfeited their claim to them. They &s;eemed to rely much on the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and on the whole Popi&s;h party abroad, of which they were the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable branch at home. But <HI>England</HI> did naturally incline to &s;upport the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;ts. And, as that intere&s;t in <HI>Ireland</HI> had gone in very unanimou&s;ly to the de&s;ign of the King's Re&s;to|ration, and had merited much on that account, &s;o they drew over the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> to join with them, in order to an act confirming <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s &s;ettlement. Only a Court of claims was &s;et up, to examine the preten&s;ions of &s;ome of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> who had
<PB N="176" REF="191">
&s;pecial excu&s;es for them&s;elves, why they &s;hould not be included in the general forfeiture of the Nation. Some were under age: Others were travelling, or &s;erving abroad: And many had di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd them&s;elves in the King's &s;ervice, when he was in <HI>Flan|ders;</HI> chiefly under the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> who pleaded much for them, and was always depended on by them, as their chief pa|tron. It was thought mo&s;t equitable, to &s;end over men from <HI>England,</HI> who were not concerned in the intere&s;ts or pa&s;&s;ions of the parties of that Kingdom, to try tho&s;e claims. Their pro|ceedings were much cried out on: For it was &s;aid, that every man's claim, who could &s;upport it with a good pre&s;ent, was found good, and that all the members of that Court came back very rich. So that, tho' the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> thought they had not ju&s;tice enough done them, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;aid they had too much. When any thing was to be proved by witne&s;&s;es, &s;ets of them were hired, to depo&s;e according to the in&s;tructions given them. This was then cried out on, as a new &s;cene of wickedne&s;s, that was then opened, and which mu&s;t in the end &s;ubvert all ju&s;tice and good government. The infection has &s;pread &s;ince that time, and cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea. And the danger of being ruined by fal&s;e witne&s;|&s;es has become &s;o terrible, that there is no &s;ecurity again&s;t it, but from the &s;incerity of juries. And if the&s;e come to be packt, then all men may be &s;oon at mercy, if a wicked government &s;hould &s;et on a violent pro&s;ecution, as has happened oftner than once. I am not in&s;tructed enough in the affairs of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to carry this matter into more particulars. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> intere&s;t was managed chiefly by two men of a very indifferent reputation: The Earls of <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> and <HI>Orrery.</HI> The chief manager of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> intere&s;t was <HI>Richard Talbot,</HI> one of the Duke's bedchamber men, who had much cunning, and had the &s;ecret both of his ma&s;ter's plea&s;ures, and of his religion, for &s;ome years, and was afterwards rai&s;ed by him to be Earl and Duke of <HI>Tirconnel.</HI> Thus I have gone over the &s;everal branches of the &s;ettlement of mat|ters after the Re&s;toration. I have re&s;erved the affairs of the Church la&s;t, as tho&s;e about which I have taken the mo&s;t pains to be well informed; and which I do therefore offer to the rea|der with &s;ome a&s;&s;urance, and on which I hope due reflection will be made.</P>
<P>At the Re&s;toration, <HI>Juxon,</HI> the anciente&s;t and mo&s;t eminent <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bi&s;hops who had then the greate&s;t cre|dit.</NOTE> of the former Bi&s;hops, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted the late King in his la&s;t hours, was promoted to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> more out of decency, than that he was then capable to fill that po&s;t; for as he was never a great divine, &s;o he was now &s;uperannuated. Tho' others have a&s;&s;ured me, that after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;es with the King he was &s;o
<PB N="177" REF="192">
much &s;truck with what he ob&s;erved in him, that upon that he lo&s;t both heart and hope. The King treated him with outward re&s;pect, but had no great regard to him. <HI>Sheldon</HI> and <HI>Morley</HI> were the men that had the greate&s;t credit. <HI>Sheldon</HI> was e&s;teemed a learned man before the wars: But he was now engaged &s;o deep in politicks, that &s;carce any prints of what he had been remain|ed. He was a very dextrous man in bu&s;ine&s;s, had a great quick|ne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, and a very true judgment. He was a ge|nerous and charitable man. He had a great plea&s;antne&s;s of conver&s;ation, perhaps too great. He had an art, that was pe|culiar to him, of treating all that came to him in a mo&s;t obli|gingmanner: But few depended much on his profe&s;&s;ions of friend|&s;hip. He &s;eemed not to have a deep &s;en&s;e of religion, if any at all: And &s;poke of it mo&s;t commonly as of an engine of govern|ment, and a matter of policy. By this means the King came to look on him as a wi&s;e and hone&s;t Clergy man. <HI>Sheldon</HI> was at fir&s;t made Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> and was upon <HI>Juxon</HI>'s death pro|moted to <HI>Canterbury. Morley</HI> had been fir&s;t known to the world as a friend of the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI>'s: And that was enough to rai&s;e a man's character. He had continued for many years in the Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s family, and was his particular friend. He was a Calvini&s;t with relation to the Arminian points, and was thought a friend to the Puritans before the wars: But he took care after his promotion to free him&s;elf from all &s;u&s;picions of that kind. He was a pious and charitable man, of a very exemplary life, but extream pa&s;&s;ionate, and very ob&s;tinate. He was fir&s;t made Bi&s;hop of <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI> Doctor <HI>Hammond,</HI> for whom that See was de&s;igned, died a little before the Re&s;toration, which was an un&s;peakable lo&s;s to the Church: For, as he was a man of great learning, and of mo&s;t eminent merit, he having been the per|&s;on that during the bad times had maintained the cau&s;e of the Church in a very &s;ingular manner, &s;o he was a very moderate man in his temper, tho' with a high principle; and probably he would have fallen into healing coun&s;els. He was al&s;o much &s;et on reforming abu&s;es, and for rai&s;ing in the Clergy a due &s;en&s;e of the obligations they lay under. But by his death <HI>Morley</HI> was advanced to <HI>Worce&s;ter:</HI> And not long after he was removed to <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> void by <HI>Duppa</HI>'s death, who had been the King's tutor, tho' no way fit for that po&s;t; but he was a meek and humble man, and much loved for the &s;weetne&s;s of his temper; and would have been more e&s;teemed, if he had died before the Re&s;toration; for he made not that u&s;e of the great wealth that flowed in upon him that was expected. <HI>Morley</HI> was thought always the hone&s;ter man of the two, as <HI>Sheldon</HI> was certainly the abler man.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="193">
The fir&s;t point in debate was, whether conce&s;&s;ions &s;hould be made, and pains taken to gain the Di&s;&s;enters, or not; e&s;pecial|ly the Pre&s;byterians. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> was much for it; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates concerning the uniting with the Presbyteri|ans.</NOTE> and got the King to publi&s;h a declaration &s;oon after his Re&s;to|ration concerning Eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, to which if he had &s;tood, very probably the greate&s;t part of them might have been gain|ed. But the Bi&s;hops did not approve of this: And after the &s;er|vice they did that Lord in the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s marriage, he would not put any hard&s;hip on tho&s;e who had &s;o &s;ignally obli|ged him. This di&s;gu&s;ted the Lord <HI>Southampton,</HI> who was for carrying on the de&s;ign that had been much talked of during the wars, of moderating matters both with relation to the govern|ment of the Church, and the wor&s;hip and ceremonies: Which created &s;ome coldne&s;s between him and the Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> when the Lord Chancellour went off from tho&s;e de&s;igns. The con&s;ideration that tho&s;e Bi&s;hops and their party had in the mat|ter was this: The Pre&s;byterians were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of mo&s;t of the great benefices in the Church, chiefly in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and in the two Univer&s;ities. It is true, all that had come in|to the room of tho&s;e who were turned out by the Parliament, or the vi&s;itors &s;ent by them, were removed by the cour&s;e of law, as men that were illegally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of other mens rights: And that even where the former incumbents were dead, becau&s;e a title originally wrong was &s;till wrong in law. But there were a great many of them in very eminent po&s;ts, who were legally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them. Many of the&s;e, chiefly in the city of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> had gone into the de&s;ign of the Re&s;toration in &s;o &s;ignal a manner, and with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that they had great merit, and a ju&s;t title to very high preferment. Now, as there remained a great deal of the old animo&s;ity again&s;t them for what they had done during the wars, &s;o it was &s;aid, it was better to have a &s;chi&s;m out of the Church than within it; and that the half conformity of the Puritans before the war had &s;et up a faction in every city and town between the lecturers and the incumbents, that the former took all methods to render them&s;elves popular, and to rai&s;e the benevolence of their people, which was their chief &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, by di&s;paraging the government both in Church and State. They had al&s;o many &s;tories among them, of the cre|dit they had in the elections of Parliament men, which they in|fu&s;ed in the King, to po&s;&s;e&s;s him with the nece&s;&s;ity of having none to &s;erve in the Church, but per&s;ons that &s;hould be firmly tied to his intere&s;t, both by principle, and by &s;ub&s;criptions and oaths. It is true, the joy then &s;pread thro' the Nation had got at this time a new Parliament to be elected of men &s;o high and
<PB N="179" REF="194">
&s;o hot, that, unle&s;s the Court had re&s;trained them, they would have carried things much farther than they did, again&s;t all that had been concerned in the late wars: But they were not to ex|pect &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s at all times: Therefore they thought it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make &s;ure work at this time: And, in&s;tead of u&s;ing me|thods to bring in the &s;ectaries, they re&s;olved rather to &s;eek the mo&s;t effectual ones for ca&s;ting them out, and bringing a new &s;et of men into the Church. This took with the King, at lea&s;t it &s;eemed to do &s;o. But, tho' he put on an outward appearance of moderation, yet he was in another and deeper laid de&s;ign, to which the heat of the&s;e men proved &s;ub&s;ervient, for bringing in of Popery. A Popi&s;h Queen was a great &s;tep to keep it in coun|tenance at Court, and to have a great many Prie&s;ts going about the Court making converts. It was thought, a toleration was the only method for &s;etting it a going all the Nation over. And nothing could make a toleration for Popery pa&s;s, but the hav|ing great bodies of men put out of the Church, and put un|der &s;evere laws, which &s;hould force them to move for a tolera|tion, and &s;hould make it rea&s;onable to grant it to them. And it was re&s;olved, that whatever &s;hould be granted of that &s;ort &s;hould go in &s;o large a manner, that Papi&s;ts &s;hould be compre|hended within it. So the Papi&s;ts had this generally &s;pread among them, that they &s;hould oppo&s;e all propo&s;itions for comprehen&s;i|on, and &s;hould animate the Church party to maintain their ground again&s;t all the &s;ectaries. And in that point they &s;eemed zea|lous for the Church. But at the &s;ame time they &s;poke of tole|ration, as nece&s;&s;ary both for the peace and quiet of the Nation, and for the encouragement of trade. And with this the Duke was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that he declared him&s;elf a mo&s;t violent enemy to comprehen&s;ion, and as zealous for toleration. The King being thus re&s;olved on fixing the terms of conformity to what they had been before the war, without making the lea&s;t abate|ment or alteration, they carried on &s;till an appearance of mode|ration, till the &s;trength of the parties &s;hould appear in the new Parliament.</P>
<P>So, after the declaration was &s;et out, a commi&s;&s;ion was grant|ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">A treaty in the <HI>Savoy.</HI></NOTE> to twelve of a &s;ide, with nine a&s;&s;i&s;tants to each &s;ide, who were appointed to meet at the <HI>Savoy,</HI> and to con&s;ider on the ways of uniting both &s;ides. At their fir&s;t meeting, <HI>Sheldon</HI> told them, that tho&s;e of the Church had not de&s;ired this meeting, as being &s;atisfied with the legal e&s;tabli&s;hment; and therefore they had nothing to offer; but it belonged to the other &s;ide, who moved for alterations, to offer both their exceptions to the laws in being, and the alterations that they propo&s;ed. He told them,
<PB N="180" REF="195">
they were to lay all they had to offer before them at once; for they would not engage to treat about any one particular, till they &s;aw how far their demands went: And he &s;aid, that all was to be tran&s;acted in writing, tho' the others in&s;i&s;ted on an ami|cable conference; which was at fir&s;t denied: Yet &s;ome hopes were given of allowing it at la&s;t. Papers were upon this given in. The Pre&s;byterians moved, that Bi&s;hop <HI>U&s;her</HI>'s Reduction &s;hould be laid down as a ground-work to treat on; that Bi&s;hops &s;hould not govern their dioce&s;e by their &s;ingle authority, nor depute it to Lay officers in their Courts, but &s;hould in matters of ordinati|on and juri&s;diction take along with them the coun&s;el and con|currence of the Pre&s;byters. They did offer &s;everal exceptions to the Liturgy, again&s;t the many re&s;pon&s;es by the people; and they de&s;ired, all might be made one continued prayer. They de|&s;ired that no le&s;&s;ons &s;hould be taken out of the Apocryphal books; that the P&s;alms u&s;ed in the daily &s;ervice &s;hould be according to the new tran&s;lation. They excepted to many parts of the office of bapti&s;m, that import the inward regeneration of all that were baptized. But as they propo&s;ed the&s;e amendments, &s;o they did al&s;o offer a Liturgy new drawn by Mr. <HI>Baxter.</HI> They in&s;i&s;ted mainly again&s;t kneeling at the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, chiefly again&s;t the impo&s;ing it; and moved that the po&s;ture might be left free, and that the u&s;e of the &s;urplice, of the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m, of God-fathers being the &s;pon&s;ors in bapti&s;m, and of the holy days, might be aboli&s;hed. <HI>Sheldon</HI> &s;aw well what the effect would be of putting them to make all their demands at once. The number of them rai&s;ed a mighty outcry again&s;t them, as people that could never be &s;atisfied. But nothing gave &s;o great an advantage again&s;t them, as their offering a new Liturgy. In this they were divided among them&s;elves. Some were for in&s;i&s;ting only on a few important things, reckoning that, if they were gained, and a union followed upon that, it would be ea&s;ier to gain other things afterwards. But all this was overthrown by Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> who was a man of great piety; and, if he had not meddled in too many things, would have been e&s;teemed one of the learned men of the age: He writ near two hundred books: Of the&s;e, three are large folios: He had a very moving and pathetical way of writing, and was his whole life long a man of great zeal and much &s;implicity; but was mo&s;t unhappily &s;ubtle and metaphy&s;ical in every thing. There was a great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion paid to him by the whole party. So he per&s;uaded them, that from the words of the commi&s;&s;ion they were bound to offer every thing that they thought might conduce to the good or peace of the Church, without con&s;ider|ing

what was like to be obtained, or what effect their demand|ing &s;o much might have, in irritating the minds of tho&s;e who were then the &s;uperiour body in &s;trength and number. All the whole matter was at la&s;t reduced to one &s;ingle point, whether it was lawful to determine the certain u&s;e of things indifferent in the wor&s;hip of God? The Bi&s;hops held them to that point, and pre&s;&s;ed them to &s;hew that any of the things impo&s;ed were of them&s;elves unlawful. The Pre&s;byterians declined this; but af|firmed, that other circum&s;tances might make it become unlawful to &s;ettle a peremptory law about things indifferent; which they applied chiefly to kneeling in the Sacrament, and &s;tood upon it that a law, which excluded all that did not kneel from the Sacra|ment, was unlawful, as a limitation in the point of communion put on the laws of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which ought to be the only condition of tho&s;e who had a right to it. Upon this point there was a free conference that la&s;ted &s;ome days. The two men, that had the chief management of the debate, were the mo&s;t unfit to heal matters, and the fitte&s;t to widen them, that could have been found out. <HI>Baxter</HI> was the opponent, and <HI>Gunning</HI> was the re&s;pon|dent; who was afterwards advanced, fir&s;t to <HI>Chiche&s;ter,</HI> and then to <HI>Ely:</HI> He was a man of great reading, and noted for a &s;pecial &s;ubtilty of arguing: All the arts of &s;ophi&s;try were made u&s;e of by him on all occa&s;ions, in as confident a manner, as if they had been &s;ound rea&s;oning: He was a man of an innocent life, un|weariedly active to very little purpo&s;e: He was much &s;et on the reconciling us with Popery in &s;ome points: And, becau&s;e the charge of idolatry &s;eemed a bar to all thoughts of reconciliation with them, he &s;et him&s;elf with very great zeal to clear the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> of idolatry: This made many &s;u&s;pect him as inclining to go over to them: But he was far from it; and was a very hone&s;t, &s;incere man, but of no &s;ound judgment, and of no pru|dence in affairs: He was for our conforming in all things to the rules of the Primitive Church, particularly in praying for the dead, in the u&s;e of oil, with many other rituals: He form|ed many in <HI>Cambridge</HI> upon his own notions, who have carried them perhaps farther than he intended. <HI>Baxter</HI> and he &s;pent &s;ome days in much logical arguing, to the diver&s;ion of the town, who thought here were a couple of fencers engaged in di&s;putes, that could never be brought to an end, nor have any good ef|fect. In conclu&s;ion, this commi&s;&s;ion, being limited to &s;uch a number of days, came to an end, before any one thing was agreed on. The Bi&s;hops in&s;i&s;ted on the laws that were &s;till in force, to which they would admit of no exception, unle&s;s it was proved that the matter of tho&s;e laws was &s;inful. They charged
<PB N="182" REF="197">
the Pre&s;byterians with having made a &s;chi&s;m, upon a charge again&s;t the Church for things, which now they them&s;elves could not call &s;inful. They &s;aid, there was no rea&s;on to gratify &s;uch a &s;ort of men in any thing: One demand granted would draw on many more: All authority both in Church and State was &s;truck at by the po&s;ition they had in&s;i&s;ted on, that it was not lawful to im|po&s;e things indifferent, &s;ince they &s;eemed to be the only proper matter in which human authority could interpo&s;e. So this fur|ni&s;hed an occa&s;ion to expo&s;e them as enemies to all order. Things had been carried at the <HI>Savoy</HI> with great &s;harpne&s;s, and many reflections. <HI>Baxter</HI> &s;aid once, &s;uch things would offend many good men in the Nation. <HI>Stearn,</HI> the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> upon that took notice that he would not &s;ay Kingdom, but Na|tion, becau&s;e he would not acknowledge a King. Of this great complaints were made, as an indecent return for the zeal they had &s;hewn in the Re&s;toration.</P>
<P>The conference broke up without doing any good. It did ra|ther hurt, and heightened the &s;harpne&s;s that was then on peoples minds to &s;uch a degree, that it needed no addition to rai&s;e it high|er. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The terms of confor|mity made harder.</NOTE> The Pre&s;byterians laid their complaints before the King: But little regard was had to them. And now all the concern that &s;eemed to employ the Bi&s;hops thoughts was, not only to make no alteration on their account, but to make the terms of con|formity much &s;tricter than they had been before the war. So it was re&s;olved to maintain conformity to the height, and to put lecturers in the &s;ame condition with the incumbents, as to oaths and &s;ub&s;criptions; and to oblige all per&s;ons to &s;ub&s;cribe an unfeigned a&s;&s;ent and con&s;ent to all and every particular contain|ed and pre&s;cribed in the book of Common Prayer. Many, who thought it lawful to conform in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, yet &s;crupled at this, as importing a particular approbation of every thing: And great di&s;tinction was made between a conformity in practice, and &s;o full and di&s;tinct an a&s;&s;ent. Yet men got over that, as importing no more but a con&s;ent of obedience: For tho' the words of the &s;ub|&s;cription, which were al&s;o to be publickly pronounced before the congregation, declaring the per&s;on's unfeigned a&s;&s;ent and con&s;ent, &s;eemed to import this, yet the clau&s;e of the act that en|joined this carried a clear explanation of it; for it enacted this declaration as an a&s;&s;ent and Con&s;ent to the u&s;e of all things con|tained in the book. Another &s;ub&s;cription was enacted, with re|lation to the League and Covenant; by which they were requir|ed to declare it unlawful upon any pretence what&s;oever to take arms again&s;t the King, renouncing the traiterous po&s;ition of
<PB N="183" REF="198">
taking arms by his authority again&s;t his per&s;on, or tho&s;e com|mi&s;&s;ioned by him, together with a declaration, that no obliga|tion lay on them or any other per&s;on from the League or Cove|nant to endeavour any change or alteration of government in Church and State, and that the Covenant was in it &s;elf an unlaw|ful oath. This was contriv'd again&s;t all the old men, who had both taken the Covenant them&s;elves, and had pre&s;s'd it upon others. So they were now to own them&s;elves very guilty in that matter. And tho&s;e, who thought it might be lawful upon great and illegal provocation to re&s;i&s;t unju&s;t inva&s;ions on the laws and li|berties of the &s;ubjects, excepted to the &s;ub&s;cription, tho' it was &s;carce &s;afe for any at that time to have in&s;i&s;ted on that point. Some thought, that &s;ince the King had taken the Covenant, he at lea&s;t was bound to &s;tand to it.</P>
<P>Another point was fixed by the Act of Uniformity, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Act of Uniformity.</NOTE> was more at large formerly: Tho&s;e, who came to <HI>England</HI> from the foreign Churches, had not been required to be ordained among us: But now all, that had not Epi&s;copal ordination, were made incapable of holding any Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Benefice. Some few al|terations were made in the Liturgy by the Bi&s;hops them&s;elves: A few new collects were made, as the prayer for all conditions of men, and the general thank&s;giving. A collect was al&s;o drawn for the Parliament, in which a new epithet was added to the King's title, that gave great offence, and occa&s;ioned much in|decent raillery: He was &s;tyled our mo&s;t religious King. It was not ea&s;y to give a proper &s;en&s;e to this, and to make it go well down; &s;ince, whatever the &s;ignification of religion might be in the <HI>Latin</HI> word, as importing the &s;acredne&s;s of the King's per|&s;on, yet in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> language it bore a &s;ignification that was no way applicable to the King. And tho&s;e who took great li|berties with him have often a&s;ked him, what mu&s;t all his peo|ple think, when they heard him prayed for as their mo&s;t reli|gious King? Some other le&s;&s;er additions were made. But care was taken, that nothing &s;hould be altered, &s;o as it had been moved by the Pre&s;byterians; for it was re&s;olved to gratify them in nothing. One important addition was made, chiefly by <HI>Gaw|den</HI>'s means: He pre&s;&s;ed that a declaration, explaining the rea|&s;ons of their kneeling at the Sacrament, which had been in King <HI>Edward</HI>'s Liturgy, but was left out in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time, &s;hould be again &s;et where it had once been. The Papi&s;ts were highly offended, when they &s;aw &s;uch an expre&s;s declaration made again&s;t the real pre&s;ence, and the Duke told me, that when he a&s;ked <HI>Sheldon</HI> how they came to declare again&s;t a doctrine, which he had been in&s;tructed was the doctrine of the Church, <HI>Sheldon</HI>
<PB N="184" REF="199">
an&s;wered, a&s;k <HI>Gawden</HI> about it, who is a Bi&s;hop of your own making: For the King had ordered his promotion for the &s;er|vice he had done. The Convocation that prepared tho&s;e alte|rations, as they added &s;ome new holy days, St. <HI>Barnabas,</HI> and the Conver&s;ion of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> &s;o they took in more le&s;&s;ons out of the Apocrypha, in particular the &s;tory of <HI>Bell</HI> and the <HI>Dragon:</HI> New offices were al&s;o drawn for two new days, the thirtieth of <HI>January,</HI> called King <HI>Charles</HI> the Martyr, and the twenty ninth of <HI>May,</HI> the day of the King's birth and return. <HI>Sancroft</HI> drew for the&s;e &s;ome offices of a very high &s;train. Yet others of a more moderate &s;train were preferred to them. But he, coming to be advanced to the See of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> got his offices to be publi&s;h|ed by the King's authority, in a time when &s;o high a &s;tyle as was in them did not &s;ound well in the Nation. Such care was taken in the choice and returns of the members of the Con|vocation, that every thing went among them as was directed by <HI>Sheldon</HI> and <HI>Morley.</HI> When they had prepared all their altera|tions, they offered them to the King, who &s;ent them to the Hou&s;e of Commons, upon which the Act of Uniformity was pre|pared by <HI>Keeling,</HI> afterwards Lord Chief Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>When it was brought into the Hou&s;e, many did apprehend that &s;o &s;evere an act might have ill effects, and began to abate of their fir&s;t heat: Upon which reports were &s;pread, and much aggravated as they were reported to the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, of the Plots of the Pre&s;byterians in &s;everal Counties. Ma|ny were taken up on tho&s;e reports: But none were ever tried for them. So, the thing being let fall, it has been given out &s;ince, that the&s;e were forged by the direction of &s;ome hot &s;pirits, who might think &s;uch arts were nece&s;&s;ary to give an alarm, and by rendring the party odious to carry &s;o &s;evere an act again&s;t them. The Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> him&s;elf was charged as having directed this piece of artifice: But I could never &s;ee any ground for fa&s;tening it on him: Tho' there were great appearances of foul dealing among &s;ome of the fiercer &s;ort. The Act pa&s;s'd by no great majority: And by it all who did not conform to the Liturgy by the twenty fourth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s day, in the year 1662, were deprived of all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices, without lea|ving any di&s;cretional power with the King in the execution of it, and without making provi&s;ion for the maintenance of tho&s;e who &s;hould be &s;o deprived: A &s;everity neither practi&s;ed by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in the enacting her Liturgy, nor by <HI>Cromwell</HI> in ejec|ting the Royali&s;ts, in both which a fifth part of the benefice was re&s;erved for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s day was pitched on, that, if they were then deprived, they &s;hould loo&s;e
<PB N="185" REF="200" MS="Y">
the profits of the whole year, &s;ince the tithes are commonly due at <HI>Michaelmas.</HI> The Pre&s;byterians remembred what a St. <HI>Bartho|lomew</HI>'s had been held at <HI>Paris</HI> ninety years before, which was the day of that ma&s;&s;acre, and did not &s;tick to compare the one to the other. The Book of Common-prayer with the new corrections was that to which they were to &s;ub&s;cribe. But the corrections were &s;o long a preparing, and the va&s;t number of copies, above two thou&s;and, that were to be wrought off for all the pari&s;h Churches of <HI>England,</HI> made the impre&s;&s;ion go on &s;o &s;lowly, that there were few Books &s;et out to &s;ale when the day came. So, many that were well affected to the Church, but that made con&s;cience of &s;ub&s;cribing to a book that they had not &s;een, left their benefi|ces on that very account. Some made a journey to <HI>London</HI> on purpo&s;e to &s;ee it. With &s;o much precipitation was that matter driven on, that it &s;eemed expected, that the Clergy &s;hould &s;ub|&s;cribe implicitely to a book they had never &s;een. This was done by too many, as I was informed by &s;ome of the Bi&s;hops. But the Pre&s;byterians were now in great difficulties. They had ma|ny meetings, and much di&s;puting about conformity. <HI>Reynolds</HI> accepted of the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Norwich.</HI> But <HI>Calamy</HI> and <HI>Baxter</HI> refu&s;ed the Sees of <HI>Litchfield</HI> and <HI>Hereford.</HI> And about two thou&s;and of them fell under the Parliamentary deprivation, as they gave out. The numbers have been much controverted. This rai&s;ed a grievous outcry over the Nation; tho' it was le&s;s con&s;i|dered at that time, than it would have been at any other. <HI>Bax|ter</HI> told me, that had the terms of the King's Declaration been &s;tood to, he did not believe that above three hundred of the&s;e would have been &s;o deprived. Some few, and but few, of the Epi&s;copal party were troubled at this &s;everity, or apprehen&s;ive of the very ill effects it was like to have. Here were many men, much valued, &s;ome on better grounds, and others on wor&s;e, who were now ca&s;t out ignominiou&s;ly, reduced to great poverty, provoked by much &s;piteful u&s;age, and ca&s;t upon tho&s;e popular practices that both their principles and their circum&s;tances &s;eem|ed to ju&s;tify, of forming &s;eparate congregations, and of di|verting men from the publick wor&s;hip, and from con&s;idering their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors as the lawful pa&s;tors of tho&s;e Churches in which they had &s;erved. The blame of all this fell heavie&s;t on <HI>Sheldon.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> was charged with his having entertained the Pre&s;byterians with hopes and good words, while he was all the while carrying on, or at lea&s;t giving way to the Bi&s;hop's project. When the Convocation had gone thro' the book of Com|mon-prayer; it was in the next place propo&s;ed, that, according to a clau&s;e in the King's licence, they &s;hould con&s;ider the Ca|nons
<PB N="186" REF="201">
of the Church. They had it then in their power to have reformed many abu&s;es, and particularly to have provided an ef|fectual remedy to the root of all tho&s;e, which ari&s;e from the poor maintenance that is re&s;erved to the incumbents. Almo&s;t all the lea&s;es of the Church e&s;tates over <HI>England</HI> were fallen in, there having been no renewal for twenty years. The lea&s;es for years were determined: And the wars had carried off &s;o many men, that mo&s;t of the lea&s;es for lives were fallen into the incumbents hands So that the Church e&s;tates were in them: And the fines rai&s;ed by the renewing the lea&s;es ro&s;e to about a million and a half. It was an unrea&s;onable thing to let tho&s;e who were now promo|ted carry off &s;o great a trea&s;ure. If the half had been applied to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The great fines then rai&s;ed on the Church e|&s;tates ill ap|plied.</NOTE> the buying of tithes of glebes for &s;mall Vicarages, here a foun|dation had been laid down for a great and effectual reformation. In &s;ome &s;ees forty or fifty thou&s;and pound was rai&s;ed, and ap|plied to the enriching the Bi&s;hops families. Something was done to Churches and Colleges, in particular to St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s in <HI>London:</HI> And a noble collection was made for redeeming all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;laves that were in any part of <HI>Barbary.</HI> But this fell far &s;hort of what might have been expected. In this the Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> was heavily charged, as having &s;hown that he was more the Bi&s;hop's friend than the Church's. It is true, the law made tho&s;e fines belong to the incumbents. But &s;uch an extraordinary occa&s;ion de&s;erved, that a law &s;hould have been made on purpo&s;e. What the Bi&s;hops did with tho&s;e great fines was a pattern to all the lower Dignitaries, who generally took more care of them&s;elves than of the Church. The men of merit and &s;ervice were load|ed with many livings and many dignities. With this great acce&s;&s;ion of wealth there broke in upon the Church a great deal of luxury and high living, on the pretence of ho&s;pitali|ty; while others made purcha&s;es, and left great e&s;tates, mo&s;t of which we have &s;een melt away. And with this over&s;et of wealth and pomp, that came on men in the decline of their parts and age, they, who were now growing into old age, be|came lazy and negligent in all the true concerns of the Church: They left preaching and writing to others, while they gave them&s;elves up to ea&s;e and &s;loth. In all which &s;ad repre&s;enta|tion &s;ome few exceptions are to be made; but &s;o few, that, if a new &s;et of men had not appeared of another &s;tamp, the Church had quite lo&s;t her e&s;teem over the Nation.</P>
<P>The&s;e were generally of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> formed under &s;ome di|vines, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Divines called Lati|tudinarians.</NOTE> the chief of whom were Drs. <HI>Whitchcot, Cudworth, Wil|kins, More,</HI> and <HI>Worthington. Whitchcot</HI> was a man of a rare temper, very mild and obliging. He had great credit with &s;ome
<PB N="187" REF="202">
that had been eminent in the late times; but made all the u&s;e he could of it to protect good men of all per&s;ua&s;ions. He was much for liberty of con&s;cience: And being di&s;gu&s;ted with the dry &s;y&s;tematical way of tho&s;e times, he &s;tudied to rai&s;e tho&s;e who conver&s;ed with him to a nobler &s;et of thoughts, and to con&s;ider religion as a &s;eed of a deiform nature, (to u&s;e one of his own phra&s;es.) In order to this, he &s;et young &s;tudents much on reading the ancient Philo&s;ophers, chiefly <HI>Plato, Tully,</HI> and <HI>Plotin,</HI> and on con&s;idering the Chri&s;tian religion as a doctrine &s;ent from God, both to elevate and &s;weeten humane nature, in which he was a great example, as well as a wi&s;e and kind in&s;tructer. <HI>Cudworth</HI> carried this on with a great &s;trength of genius, and a va&s;t com|pa&s;s of learning. He was a man of great conduct and prudence: Upon which his enemies did very fal&s;ly accu&s;e him of craft and di&s;&s;imulation. <HI>Wilkins</HI> was of <HI>Oxford,</HI> but removed to <HI>Cam|bridge.</HI> His fir&s;t ri&s;e was in the Elector Palatine's family, when he was in <HI>England.</HI> Afterwards he married <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s &s;i&s;ter; but made no other u&s;e of that alliance, but to do good offices, and to cover the Univer&s;ity from the &s;ourne&s;s of <HI>Owen</HI> and <HI>Goodwin.</HI> At <HI>Cambridge</HI> he joined with tho&s;e who &s;tudied to propagate bet|ter thoughts, to take men off from being in parties, or from narrow notions, from &s;uper&s;titious conceits, and a fiercene&s;s a|bout opinions. He was al&s;o a great ob&s;erver and a promoter of experimental philo&s;ophy, which was then a new thing, and much looked after. He was naturally ambitious, but was the wi&s;e&s;t Clergy-man I ever knew. He was a lover of mankind, and had a delight in doing good. <HI>More</HI> was an open hearted, and &s;incere chri&s;tian philo&s;opher, who &s;tudied to e&s;tabli&s;h men in the great principles of religion again&s;t athei&s;m, that was then beginning to gain ground, chiefly by rea&s;on of the hypocri&s;y of &s;ome, and the fanta&s;tical conceits of the more &s;incere enthu|&s;ia&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>Hobbs,</HI> who had long followed the Court, and pa&s;&s;ed there for <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hobbs</HI>'s Le|viathan.</NOTE> a mathematical man, tho' he really knew little that way, being di&s;gu&s;ted by the Court, came into <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s time, and publi&s;hed a very wicked book, with a very &s;trange title, <HI>The Leviathan.</HI> His main principles were, that all men acted under an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, in which he &s;eemed protected by the then received doctrine of ab&s;olute decrees. He &s;eemed to think that the univer&s;e was God, and that &s;ouls were material, Thought being only &s;ubtil and unperceptible motion. He thought intere&s;t and fear were the chief principles of &s;ociety: And he put all morality in the following that which was our own private will or advan|tage. He thought religion had no other foundation than the
<PB N="188" REF="203">
laws of the land. And he put all the law in the will of the Prince, or of the people: For he writ his book at fir&s;t in favour of ab|&s;olute monarchy, but turned it afterwards to gratify the repub|lican party. The&s;e were his true principles, tho' he had di&s;|gui&s;ed them, for deceiving unwary readers. And this &s;et of no|tions came to &s;pread much. The novelty and boldne&s;s of them &s;et many on reading them. The impiety of them was accepta|ble to men of corrupt minds, which were but too much prepared to receive them by the extravagancies of the late times. So this &s;et of men at <HI>Cambridge</HI> &s;tudied to a&s;&s;ert, and examine the prin|ciples of religion and morality on clear grounds, and in a phi|lo&s;ophical method. In this <HI>More</HI> led the way to many that came after him. <HI>Worthington</HI> was a man of eminent piety and great humility, and practi&s;ed a mo&s;t &s;ublime way of &s;elf-denial and de|votion. All the&s;e, and tho&s;e who were formed under them, &s;tudied to examine farther into the nature of things than had been done formerly. They declared again&s;t &s;uper&s;tition on the one hand, and enthu&s;ia&s;m on the other. They loved the con|&s;titution of the Church, and the Liturgy, and could well live under them: But they did not think it unlawful to live under another form. They wi&s;hed that things might have been carried with more moderation. And they continued to keep a good corre|&s;pondence with tho&s;e who had differed from them in opinion, and allowed a great freedom both in philo&s;ophy and in divinity: From whence they were called men of Latitude. And upon this men of narrower thoughts and fiercer tempers fa&s;tened upon them the name of Latitudinarians. They read <HI>Epi&s;copius</HI> much. And the making out the rea&s;ons of things being a main part of their &s;tudies, their enemies called them Socinians. They were all very zealous again&s;t popery. And &s;o, they becoming &s;oon very con&s;iderable, the Papi&s;ts &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t them to decry them as Athei&s;ts, Dei&s;ts, or at be&s;t Socinians. And now that the main principle of religion was &s;truck at by <HI>Hobbs</HI> and his followers, the Papi&s;ts acted upon this a very &s;trange part. They went in &s;o far even into the argument for Athei&s;m, as to publi&s;h many books, in which they affirmed, that there was no certain proofs of the Chri&s;tian religion, unle&s;s we took it from the au|thority of the Church as infallible. This was &s;uch a delivering up of the cau&s;e to them, that it rai&s;ed in all good men a very high indignation at Popery; that party &s;hewing, that they cho&s;e to make men, who would not turn Papi&s;ts, become Athei&s;ts, rather than believe Chri&s;tianity upon any other ground than in|fallibility.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="204">
The mo&s;t eminent of tho&s;e, who were formed under tho&s;e great men I have mention'd, were <HI>Tillot&s;on, Stilling fleet,</HI> and <HI>Pa|trick.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e was a man of a clear head, and a &s;weet <NOTE PLACE="marg">A character of &s;ome di|vines.</NOTE> temper. He had the brighte&s;t thoughts, and the mo&s;t correct &s;tyle of all our divines; and was e&s;teemed the be&s;t preacher of the age. He was a very prudent man; and had &s;uch a manage|ment with it, that I never knew any Clergy-man &s;o univer&s;ally e&s;teemed and beloved, as he was for above twenty years. He was eminent for his oppo&s;ition to Popery. He was no friend to per&s;ecution, and &s;tood up much again&s;t Athei&s;m. Nor did any man contribute more to bring the City to love our wor&s;hip, than he did. But there was &s;o little &s;uper&s;tition, and &s;o much rea&s;on and gentlene&s;s in his way of explaining things, that malice was long levelled at him, and in conclu&s;ion broke out fiercely on him. <HI>Stilling fleet</HI> was a man of much more learning, but of a more re&s;erved, and a haughtier temper. He in his youth writ an <HI>Irenicum</HI> for healing our divi&s;ions, with &s;o much learning and moderation, that it was e&s;teemed a ma&s;ter-piece. His notion was, that the Apo&s;tles had &s;ettled the Church in a con&s;titution of Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts, and Deacons, but had made no perpetual law about it, having only taken it in, as they did many other things, from the cu&s;toms and practice of the &s;ynagogue; from which he inferred, that certainly the con&s;titution was lawful &s;ince au|thori&s;ed by them, but not nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince they had made no &s;ettled law about it. This took with many; but was cried out upon by others as an attempt again&s;t the Church. Yet the ar|gument was managed with &s;o much learning and &s;kill, that none of either &s;ide ever undertook to an&s;wer it. After that, he wrote again&s;t infidelity, beyond any that had gone before him. And then he engaged to write again&s;t Popery, which he did with &s;uch an exactne&s;s and liveline&s;s, that no books of controver&s;y were &s;o much read and valued, as his were. He was a great man in ma|ny re&s;pects. He knew the world well, and was e&s;teemed a ve|ry wi&s;e man. The writing of his <HI>Irenicum</HI> was a great &s;nare to him: For, to avoid the imputations which that brought upon him, he not only retracted the book, but he went into the hu|mours of that high &s;ort of people beyond what became him, perhaps beyond his own &s;en&s;e of things. He applied him&s;elf much to the &s;tudy of the law and records, and the original of our con&s;titution, and was a very extraordinary man. <HI>Patrick</HI> was a great preacher. He wrote much, and well, and chiefly on the Scriptures. He was a laborious man in his function, of great &s;trictne&s;s of life, but a little too &s;erve again&s;t tho&s;e who differed from him. But that was, when he thought their doctrines &s;truck
<PB N="190" REF="205">
at the fundamentals of religion. He became afterwards more moderate. To the&s;e I &s;hall add another divine, who, tho' of <HI>Oxford,</HI> yet as he was formed by Bi&s;hop <HI>Wilkins,</HI> &s;o he went in|to mo&s;t of their principles; but went far beyond them in learn|ing. <HI>Lloyd</HI> was a great critick in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> authors, but chiefly in the Scriptures; of the words and phra&s;es of which he carried the mo&s;t perfect concordance in his memory, and had it the readie&s;t about him, of all men that ever I knew. He was an exact hi&s;torian, and the mo&s;t punctual in chronology of all our divines. He had read the mo&s;t books, and with the be&s;t judgment, and had made the mo&s;t copious ab&s;tracts out of them, of any in this age: So that <HI>Wilkins</HI> u&s;ed to &s;ay, he had the mo&s;t learning in ready ca&s;h of any he ever knew. He was &s;o exact in every thing he &s;et about, that he never gave over any part of &s;tudy, till he had quite ma&s;tered it. But when that was done, he went to ano|ther &s;ubject, and did not lay out his learning with the diligence with which he laid it in. He had many volumes of materials upon all &s;ubjects laid together in &s;o di&s;tinct a method, that he could with very little labour write on any of them. He had more life in his imagination, and a truer judgment, than may &s;eem con&s;i&s;tent with &s;uch a laborious cour&s;e of &s;tudy. Yet, as much as he was &s;et on learning, he had never neglected his pa&s;toral care. For &s;everal years he had the greate&s;t cure in <HI>England,</HI> St. <HI>Martins,</HI> which he took care of with an applicati|on and diligence beyond any about him; to whom he was an example, or rather a reproach, &s;o few following his example. He was a holy, humble, and patient man, ever ready to do good when he &s;aw a proper opportunity: Even his love of &s;tudy did not divert him from that. He did upon his promotion find a very worthy &s;ucce&s;&s;or in his cure, <HI>Teni&s;on,</HI> who carried on and advanced all tho&s;e good methods that he had begun in the ma|nagement of that great cure. He endowed &s;chools, &s;et up a pub|lick library, and kept many Curates to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his indefati|gable labours among them. He was a very learned man, and took much pains to &s;tate the notions and practices of heatheni&s;h idolatry, and &s;o to fa&s;ten that charge on the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> And, <HI>Whitehall</HI> lying within that pari&s;h, he &s;tood as in the front of the battel all King <HI>James</HI>'s reign; and maintained, as well as managed, that dangerous po&s;t with great courage and much judgment, and was held in very high e&s;teem for his whole de|portment, which was ever grave and moderate. The&s;e have been the greate&s;t divines we have had the&s;e forty years: And may we ever have a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch men to fill the room of tho&s;e who have already gone off the &s;tage, and of tho&s;e who,
<PB N="191" REF="206">
being now very old, cannot hold their po&s;ts long. Of the&s;e I have writ the more fully, becau&s;e I knew them well, and have lived long in great friend&s;hip with them; but mo&s;t particularly with <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> and <HI>Lloyd.</HI> And, as I am &s;en&s;ible I owe a great deal of the con&s;ideration that has been had for me to my being known to be their friend, &s;o I have really learned the be&s;t part of what I know from them. But I owed them much more on the account of tho&s;e excellent principles and notions, of which they were in a particular manner communicative to me. This &s;et of men contributed more than can be well imagined to reform the way of preaching; which among the divines of <HI>England</HI> before them was over-run with pedantry, a great mixture of quotations from fathers and ancient writers, a long opening of a text with the con|cordance of every word in it, and a giving all the different expo&s;i|tions with the grounds of them, and the entring into &s;ome <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$.</NOTE> parts of controver&s;y, and all concluding in &s;ome, but very &s;hort, practical applications, according to the &s;ubject or the occa&s;ion. This was both long and heavy, when all was pye&punc; balled, full of many &s;ayings of different languages. The common &s;tyle of &s;ermons was either very flat and low, or &s;welled up with rheto|rick to a fal&s;e pitch of a wrong &s;ublime. The King had little or no literature, but true and good &s;en&s;e; and had got a right notion of &s;tyle; for he was in <HI>France</HI> at a time when they were much &s;et on reforming their language. It &s;oon appear'd that he had a true ta&s;te. So this help'd to rai&s;e the value of the&s;e men, when the King approved of the &s;tyle their di&s;cour&s;es ge|nerally ran in; which was clear, plain, and &s;hort. They gave a &s;hort paraphra&s;e of their text, unle&s;s where great difficulties required a more copious enlargement: But even then they cut off unnece&s;&s;ary &s;hews of learning, and applied them&s;elves to the matter, in which they opened the nature and rea&s;ons of things &s;o fully, and with that &s;implicity, that their hearers felt an in|&s;truction of another &s;ort than had commonly been ob&s;erved be|fore. So they became very much followed: And a &s;et of the&s;e men brought off the City in a great mea&s;ure from the prejudices they had formerly to the Church.</P>
<P>There was a great debate in Council, a little before St. <HI>Bar|tholomew</HI>'s day, whether the Act of Uniformity &s;hould be punc|tually <NOTE PLACE="marg">The $span$ Uniformity executed with $$gor.</NOTE> executed, or not. Some moved to have the execution of it delayed to the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament. Others were for ex|ecuting it in the main, but to connive at &s;ome eminent men, and to put Curates into their Churches to read and o&s;&s;iciate accor|ding to the Common-prayer, but to leave them to preach on,
<PB N="192" REF="207">
till they &s;hould die out. The Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> laid all the&s;e things before the King with much zeal, but with no great force. <HI>Sheldon</HI> on the other hand pre&s;s'd the execution of the law: <HI>En|gland</HI> was accu&s;tomed to obey laws: So while they &s;tood on that ground, they were &s;afe, and needed fear none of the dangers that &s;eemed to be threatened: He al&s;o undertook to fill all the va|cant pulpits, that &s;hould be for&s;aken in <HI>London,</HI> better and more to the &s;atisfaction of the people, than they had been before: And he &s;eemed to apprehend, that a very &s;mall number would fall under the deprivation, and that the gro&s;s of the party would conform. On the other hand, tho&s;e who led the party took great pains to have them all &s;trick together: They infu&s;ed it in|to them, that if great numbers &s;tood out, that would &s;hew their &s;trength, and produce new laws in their favour; whereas they would be de&s;pi&s;ed, if, after &s;o much noi&s;e made, the greater part of them &s;hould conform. So it was thought, that many went out in the croud to keep their friends company. Many of the&s;e were di&s;tingui&s;hed by their abilities and zeal. They ca&s;t them|&s;elves upon the providence of God, and the charity of their friends, which had a fair appearance, as of men that were rea|dy to &s;uffer per&s;ecution for their con&s;ciences. This begot e&s;teem, and rai&s;ed compa&s;&s;ion: Whereas the old Clergy, now much en|riched, were as much de&s;pi&s;ed. But the young Clergy that came from the Univer&s;ities did good &s;ervice. Learning was then high at <HI>Oxford;</HI> chiefly the &s;tudy of the oriental tongues, which was much rai&s;ed by the <HI>Polyglot</HI> Bible, then lately &s;et forth. They read the fathers much there. mathematicks and the newphilo|&s;ophy were in great e&s;teem. And the meetings that <HI>Wilkins</HI> had begun at <HI>Oxford</HI> were now held in <HI>London</HI> too, in &s;o publick manner, that the King him&s;elf encouraged them much, and had many experiments made before him.</P>
<P>The men that formed the Royal Society in <HI>London</HI> were Sir <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Royal $word$.</NOTE> <HI>Robert Murray,</HI> the Lord <HI>Brounker,</HI> a profound mathematician, and Doctor <HI>Ward,</HI> &s;oon after promoted to <HI>Exeter,</HI> and afterwards removed to <HI>Salisbury. Ward</HI> was a man of great reach, went deep in mathematical &s;tudies, and was a very dextrous man, if not too dextrous; for his &s;incerity was much que&s;tioned. He had complied during the late times, and held in by taking the Co|venant: So he was hated by the high men as a time-&s;erver. But the Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> &s;aw, that mo&s;t of the Bi&s;hops were men of merit by their &s;ufferings, but of no great capacity for bu&s;ine&s;s. He brought <HI>Ward</HI> in, as a man fit to govern the Church: For <HI>Ward,</HI> to get his former errors to be forgot, went into the high notions of a &s;evere conformity, and became the mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble
<PB N="193" REF="208">
man on the Bi&s;hops bench. He was a profound States man, but a very indifferent Clergy-man. Many Phy&s;icians, and other ingenious men went into the Society for natural Philo&s;ophy. But he who laboured mo&s;t, at the greate&s;t charge, and with the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s at experiments, was <HI>Robert Boyle,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Cork</HI>'s younge&s;t &s;on. He was looked on by all who knew him, as a ve|ry perfect pattern. He was a very devout Chri&s;tian, humble and mode&s;t, almo&s;t to a fault, of a mo&s;t &s;potle&s;s and exemplary life in all re&s;pects. He was highly charitable; and was a mortified and &s;elf-denied man, that delighted in nothing &s;o much as in the do|ing good. He neglected his per&s;on, de&s;pi&s;ed the world, and lived ab&s;tracted from all plea&s;ures, de&s;igns, and intere&s;ts. I preach|ed his funeral &s;ermon, in which I gave his character &s;o truly, that I do not think it nece&s;&s;ary now to enlarge more upon it. The Society for Philo&s;ophy grew &s;o con&s;iderable, that they thought fit to take out a patent, which con&s;tituted them a body, by the name of the Royal Society; of which Sir <HI>Robert Murray</HI> was the fir&s;t Pre&s;ident, Bi&s;hop <HI>Ward</HI> the &s;econd, and the Lord <HI>Brounker</HI> the third. Their hi&s;tory is writ &s;o well by Doctor <HI>Sprat,</HI> that I will in&s;i&s;t no more on them, but go on to other matters.</P>
<P>After St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI>'s day, the Di&s;&s;enters, &s;eeing both Court <NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;ultati|ons among the Papi&s;ts.</NOTE> and Parliament was &s;o much &s;et again&s;t them, had much con|&s;ulation together what to do. Many were for going over to <HI>Holland,</HI> and &s;ettling there with their Mini&s;ters. Others propo&s;|ed <HI>New-England,</HI> and the other Plantations. Upon this the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> drew to his hou&s;e a meeting of the chief Papi&s;ts in Town: And after an oath of &s;ecrecy he told them, now was the proper time for them to make &s;ome &s;teps towards the bringing in of their religion: In order to that it &s;eemed advi&s;able for them to take pains to procure favour to the Nonconformi&s;ts; (for that became the common name to them all, as Puritan had been be|fore the war:) They were the rather to be&s;tir them&s;elves to pro|cure a toleration for them in general terms, that they them|&s;elves might be comprehended within it. The Lord <HI>Aubigny</HI> &s;econded the motion. He &s;aid, it was &s;o vi&s;ibly the intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> to make a great body of the trading men &s;tay within the Kingdom, and be made ea&s;y in it, that it would have a good grace in them to &s;eem zealous for it: And, to draw in &s;o great a number of tho&s;e, who had been hitherto the hotte&s;t again&s;t them, to feel their care, and to &s;ee their zeal to &s;erve them, he recom|mended to them to make this the &s;ubject of all their di&s;cour&s;es, and to engage all their friends in the de&s;ign. <HI>Bennet</HI> did not meet with them, but was known to be of the &s;ecret; as the Lord <HI>Stafford</HI> told me in the Tower a little before his death. But that
<PB N="194" REF="209">
Lord &s;oon withdrew from tho&s;e meetings: For he apprehend|ed the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>'s heat, and that he might rai&s;e a &s;torm again&s;t them by his indi&s;creet meddling.</P>
<P>The King was &s;o far prevailed on by them, that in <HI>Decem|ber</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Declarati|on for tole|ration.</NOTE> 1662 he &s;et out a Declaration, that was generally thought to be procured by the Lord <HI>Bri&s;tol:</HI> But it had a deeper root, and was de&s;igned by the King him&s;elf. In it the King ex|pre&s;&s;ed his aver&s;ion to all &s;everities on the account of religion, but more particularly to all &s;anguinary laws; and gave hopes both to Papi&s;ts and Nonconformi&s;ts, that he would find out &s;uch ways for tempering the &s;everities of the laws, that all his &s;ub|jects &s;hould be ea&s;y under them. The wi&s;er of the Noncon|formi&s;ts &s;aw at what all this was aimed, and &s;o received it cold|ly. But the Papi&s;ts went on more warmly, and were preparing a &s;cheme for a toleration for them. And one part of it rai&s;ed great di&s;putes among them&s;elves. Some were for their taking the oath of allegiance, which renounced the Popes depo&s;ing power. But all tho&s;e that were under a management from <HI>Rome</HI> refu&s;ed this. And the Internuntio at <HI>Bru&s;&s;ells</HI> proceeded to cen&s;ure tho&s;e that were for it, as enemies to the Papal authority. A propo|&s;ition was al&s;o made for having none but &s;ecular Prie&s;ts tolera|ted in <HI>England,</HI> who &s;hould be under a Bi&s;hop, and under an e&s;tabli&s;hed government. But that all the regulars, in particular all Je&s;uits, &s;hould be under the &s;tricte&s;t penalties forbid the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> &s;et this on; for he knew well it would <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;igned for the Papi&s;ts.</NOTE> divide the Papi&s;ts among them&s;elves. But, tho' a few hone&s;t Prie&s;ts, &s;uch as <HI>Blacklow, Serjeant, Caron,</HI> and <HI>Wal&s;h</HI> were for it, yet they could not make a party among the leading men of their own &s;ide. It was pretended, that this was &s;et on foot with a de&s;ign to divide them, and &s;o to break their &s;trength. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> knew, that Cardinal <HI>de Retz,</HI> for whom he &s;aw the King had a particular e&s;teem, had come over incognito, and had been with the King in private. So, to let the King &s;ee how odious a thing his being &s;u&s;pected of Popery would be, and what a load it would lay on his government if it came to be believed, he got &s;ome of his party, as Sir <HI>Allain Brodrick</HI> told me, to move in the Hou&s;e of Commons for an Act rendring it capital to &s;ay the King was a Papi&s;t. And, whereas the King was made to believe that the old Cavaliers were become milder with relation to Popery, the Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> upon this new Act inferred, that it &s;till appeared that the opinion of his being a Papi&s;t would &s;o certainly make him odious, that for that rea&s;on the Parliament had made the &s;preading tho&s;e reports &s;o penal. But this was
<PB N="195" REF="210">
taken by another handle, while &s;ome &s;aid, that this Act was <NOTE PLACE="marg">1663.</NOTE> made on purpo&s;e, that, tho' the de&s;ign of bringing in Popery &s;hould become ever &s;o vi&s;ible, none &s;hould dare to &s;peak of it. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> had a quite contrary de&s;ign in it, to let the King &s;ee how fatal the effects of any &s;uch &s;u&s;picions were like to be. When the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;toll</HI>'s declaration was propo&s;ed in Council, Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> and the Bi&s;hops oppo&s;ed it. But there was nothing in it directly again&s;t law, hopes being only given of endeavours to make all men ea&s;y under the King's government: So it pa&s;s'd. The Earl of <HI>Bri&s;toll</HI> carried it as a great victory. And he, with the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and all Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s enemies, declared openly again&s;t him. But the poor Prie&s;ts, who had made tho&s;e hone&s;t motions, were very ill looked on by all their own party, as men gained on de&s;ign to betray them. I knew all this from <HI>Peter Wal&s;h</HI> him&s;elf, who was the hone&s;te&s;t and learnede&s;t man I ever knew among them. He was of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> extraction, and of the Franci&s;can order: And was indeed in all points of controver&s;y almo&s;t wholly Prote&s;tant: But he had &s;en&s;es of his own, by which he excu&s;ed his adhe|ring to the Church of <HI>Rome:</HI> And he maintained, that with the&s;e he could continue in the communion of that Church with|out &s;in: And he &s;aid, that he was &s;ure he did &s;ome good &s;tay|ing &s;till on that &s;ide, but that he could do none at all if he &s;hould come over: He thought, no man ought to for&s;ake that religion in which he was born and bred, unle&s;s he was clearly con|vinced, that he mu&s;t certainly be damned if he continued in it. He was an hone&s;t and able man, much practi&s;ed in intrigues, and knew well the methods of the Je&s;uits, and other Mi&s;&s;iona|ries. He told me often, there was nothing which the whole Popi&s;h party feared more than an union of tho&s;e of the Church of <HI>England</HI> with the Pre&s;byterians: They knew, we grew the weaker, the more our breaches were widened; and that, the more we were &s;et again&s;t one another, we would mind them the le&s;s. The Papi&s;ts had two maxims, from which they never departed: The one was to divide us: And the other was to keep them|&s;elves united, and either to &s;et on an indi&s;criminated toleration, or a general pro&s;ecution; for &s;o we loved to &s;often the har&s;h word of p$span$ution. And he ob&s;erved, not without great in|dignation at us for our folly, that we, in&s;tead of uniting among our &s;elves, and dividing them, according to their maxims, did all we could to keep them united, and to disjoint $$r own body: For he was per&s;uaded, if the government had held an heavy hand on the Regulars and the Je&s;uits, and had been gentle to the Seculars, and had &s;et up a di&s;tingui&s;hing te&s;t, renouncing all
<PB N="196" REF="211">
&s;ort of power in the Pope over the temporal rights of Princes, to which the Regulars and the Je&s;uits could never &s;ubmit, that this would have engaged them into &s;uch violent quarrels among them&s;elves, that cen&s;ures would have been thundred at <HI>Rome</HI> again&s;t all that &s;hould take any &s;uch te&s;t; which would have procur|ed much di&s;puting, and might have probably ended in the revolt of the &s;oberer part of that Church. But he found, that, tho' the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> liked the project, little regard was had to it by the governing party in the Court.</P>
<P>The Church party was allarmed at all this. And tho' they were unwilling to &s;u&s;pect the King or the Duke, yet the ma|nagement for Popery was &s;o vi&s;ible, that in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>'s de|&s;igns.</NOTE> Parliament the King's declaration was &s;everely arraigned, and the authors of it were plainly enough pointed at. This was done chiefly by the Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s Friends. And at this the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> was highly di&s;plea&s;ed, and re&s;olved to take all po&s;&s;ible methods to ruine the Earl of <HI>Clarendon.</HI> He had a great &s;kill in a&s;trology, and had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the King with an high opi|nion of it: And told the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> as he &s;aid to the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter, Wilmot,</HI> from whom I had it, that he was confident that he would lay that before the King, which would totally alienate him both from his brother and from the Lord <HI>Clarendon:</HI> For he could demon&s;trate by the principles of that art, that he was to fall by his brother's means, if not by his hand: And he was &s;ure this would work on the King. It would &s;o, &s;aid the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> but in another way than he expected: For it would make the King be &s;o afraid of of|fending him, that he would do any thing rather than provoke him. Yet the Lord <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> would lay this before the King. And the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> believed, that it had the effect ever after, that he had apprehended: For tho' the King never loved nor e&s;teemed the Duke, yet he &s;eemed to &s;tand in &s;ome &s;ort of awe of him.</P>
<P>But this was not all: The Lord <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> re&s;olved to offer ar|ticles <NOTE PLACE="marg">He accu&s;ed <HI>Clarendon</HI> in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</NOTE> of impeachment again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> to the Hou&s;e of Lords, tho' it was plainly provided again&s;t $word$ the &s;tatute again&s;t appeals in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth. $span$t both the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> the fathers of the&s;e two Lords, had broken thro' that in the former reign. So the Lord <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> drew his impeachment, and carried it to the King, who took much pains on him in a &s;oft and gentle manner to di&s;&s;uade him from it. But he would not be wrought on. And he told the King plainly, that, if he for&s;ook him, he would rai&s;e &s;uch
<PB N="197" REF="212">
di&s;orders that all <HI>England</HI> &s;hould feel them, and the King him|&s;elf &s;hould not be without a large &s;hare in them. The King, as the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> told me, who &s;aid he had it from him&s;elf, &s;aid, he was &s;o provoked at this, that he dur&s;t not tru&s;t him&s;elf in an&s;wering it, but went out of the room, and &s;ent the Lord <HI>Aubigny</HI> to &s;often him: But all was in vain. It is very pro|bable, that the Lord <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> knew the &s;ecret of the King's reli|gion, which both made him &s;o bold, and the King &s;o fearful. The next day he carried the charge to the Hou&s;e of Lords. It was of a very mixed nature: In one part he charged the Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> with rai&s;ing jealou&s;ies, and &s;preading reports of the King's being a Papi&s;t: And yet in the other articles he charged him with corre&s;pondence with the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> in order to the making the Lord <HI>Aubigny</HI> a Cardinal, and &s;everal other things of a very &s;trange nature. As &s;oon as he put it in, he, it &s;eems, either repented of it, or at lea&s;t was prevailed with to ab&s;cond. He was ever after that looked on, as a man capable of the highe&s;t extravagances po&s;&s;ible. He made the matter wor&s;e by a letter that he wrote to the Lords, in which he ex|pre&s;&s;ed his fear of the danger the King was in by the Duke's having of guards. Proclamations went out for di&s;covering him. But he kept out of the way till the &s;torm was over. The Parlia|ment expre&s;&s;ed a firm re&s;olution to maintain the Act of Uniformity. And the King being run much in debt, they gave him four &s;ub|&s;ides, being willing to return to the ancient way of taxes by &s;ub|&s;idies. But the&s;e were &s;o evaded, and brought in &s;o little money, that the Court re&s;olved never to have recour&s;e to that method of rai&s;ing money any more, but to betake them&s;elves for the future to the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment begun in the war. The Convocation gave at the &s;ame time four &s;ub&s;idies, which proved as heavy on them, as they were light on the temporalty. This was the la&s;t aid that the &s;piri|tualty gave: For the whole proving &s;o incon&s;iderable, and yet &s;o unequally heavy on the Clergy, it was re&s;olved on hereafter to tax Church benefices as temporal e&s;tates were taxed; which proved indeed a lighter burden, but was not &s;o honorable as when it was given by them&s;elves. Yet intere&s;t prevailing above the point of honour, they acquie&s;ced in it. So the Convocati|ons being no more nece&s;&s;ary to the Crown, this made that there was le&s;s reg$$d had to them afterwards. They were often di&s;|continued, and prorogued: And when they met, it was only for form. The Parliament did pa&s;s another Act, that was very ac|ceptable to the Court, and that &s;hewed a confidence in the King, repealing the Act of triennial Parliaments, which had been ob|tained with &s;o much difficulty, and was clogged with &s;o many
<PB N="198" REF="213">
clau&s;es, which &s;eemed to transfer the power from the Crown to the people, that, when it was carried, it was thought the greate&s;t &s;ecurity that the people had for all their other liberties. But it was now given up without a &s;truggle, or any clau&s;es for a certainty of Parliaments, be&s;ides a general one, that there &s;hould be a Parliament called within three years after the di&s;&s;o|lution of the pre&s;ent Parliament, and &s;o ever afterwards; but without any &s;evere clau&s;es, in ca&s;e the Act was not ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>As for our foreign negotiations I know nothing in particular concerning them. Secretary <HI>Bennet</HI> had them all in his hands: And I had no confidence with any about him. Our concerns with <HI>Portugal</HI> were publick: And I knew no &s;ecrets about the&s;e.</P>
<P>By a melancholy in&s;tance to our private family it appeared, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Plot di&s;|covered.</NOTE> that <HI>France</HI> was taking all po&s;&s;ible methods to do every thing that the King de&s;ired. The Common-wealths-men were now thinking, that they &s;aw the &s;tream of the Nation beginning to turn again&s;t the Court: And upon that they were meeting, and laying plots to retrieve their lo&s;t game. One of the&s;e being taken, and apprehending he was in danger, begg'd his life of the King, and &s;aid, if he might be a&s;&s;ured of his pardon, he would tell where my uncle <HI>Wari&s;ton</HI> was, who was then in <HI>Rou|en:</HI> For the air of <HI>Hamborough</HI> agreed &s;o ill with him, that he was advi&s;ed to go to <HI>France;</HI> and this man was on the &s;ecret. The King &s;ent one to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> de&s;iring he might be put in his hands: And this was immediately done: And no notice was &s;ent to my uncle to go out of the way, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es, when a per&s;on is not charged with a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations or any infamous action, but only with crimes of State. He was &s;ent over, and kept &s;ome months in the Tower of <HI>London;</HI> and from that was &s;ent to <HI>Scotland,</HI> as &s;hall be told afterwards.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of a war with <HI>Holland</HI> was now working. I have <NOTE PLACE="marg">The de&s;ign of $word$ war $word$ the States.</NOTE> been very po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured by States-men of both &s;ides, that the <HI>French</HI> &s;et it on in a very artificial manner: For while they en|couraged us to in&s;i&s;t on &s;ome extravagant demands, they at the &s;ame time pre&s;&s;ed the <HI>Dutch</HI> not to yield to them: And as they put them in hopes, that, if a rupture &s;hould follow, they would a&s;&s;i&s;t them according to their alliance, &s;o they a&s;&s;ured us that they would do us no hurt. <HI>Downing</HI> was then employed in <HI>Holland,</HI> a crafty fawning man, who was ready to turn to eve|ry &s;ide that was uppermo&s;t, and to betray tho&s;e who by their former friend&s;hip and &s;ervices thought they might depend on him; as he did &s;ome of the Regicides, whom he got in his hands under tru&s;t, and then delivered them up. He had been <HI>Crom|well</HI>'s Amba&s;&s;adour in <HI>Holland,</HI> where he had offered per&s;onal af|fronts
<PB N="199" REF="214">
both to the King and the Duke: Yet he had by &s;ome ba&s;e practices got him&s;elf to be &s;o effectually recommended by the Duke of <HI>Albermarle,</HI> that all his former offences were forgiven, and he was &s;ent into <HI>Holland</HI> as the King's Amba&s;&s;adour, who&s;e behaviour towards the King him&s;elf the States had ob&s;erved. So they had rea&s;on to conclude he was &s;ent over with no good intent, and that he was capable of managing a bad de&s;ign, and very ready to undertake it. There was no vi&s;ible cau&s;e of war. A complaint of a &s;hip taken was ready to have been &s;atisfied. But <HI>Downing</HI> hindred it. So it was plain, the King hated them; and fancied they were &s;o feeble, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were &s;o much &s;uperiour to them, that a war would humble them to an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and dependence on him in all things. The States had treated, and pre&s;ented the King with great magnificence, and at a va&s;t charge, during the time that he had &s;taid among them, after <HI>England</HI> had declared for him. And, as far as ap|pearances could go, the King &s;eem'd &s;en&s;ible of it: In&s;omuch that the party for the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> were not plea&s;ed, becau&s;e their applications to him could not prevail to make him inter|po&s;e, either in the behalf of him&s;elf, or of his friends, to get the re&s;olutions taken again&s;t him to be repealed, or his party again put in places of tru&s;t and command. The King put that off as not proper to be pre&s;&s;ed by him at that time. But neither then nor afterwards did he be&s;tir him&s;elf in that matter. Tho', if either gratitude or intere&s;t had been of force, and if the&s;e had not been overruled by &s;ome more prevalent con&s;iderations, he mu&s;t have been inclined to make &s;ome returns for the &s;ervices the late Prince did him: And he mu&s;t have &s;een, what a figure he mu&s;t make by having the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> tied to him in intere&s;t, as much as he was by blood. <HI>France</HI> and Popery were the true &s;prings of all the&s;e coun&s;els. It was the intere&s;t of the King of <HI>France,</HI> that the Armies of the States might fall under &s;uch a feeblene&s;s, that they &s;hould be in no condition to make a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance, when he &s;hould be ready either to invade them, or to fall into <HI>Flanders;</HI> which he was re&s;olved to do, when&s;oever the King of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould die. The <HI>French</HI> did thus &s;et on the war between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> hoping that our Fleets &s;hould mutually weaken one another &s;o much, that the naval force of <HI>France,</HI> which was increa&s;ing very con&s;idera|bly, &s;hould be near an equality to them, when they &s;hould be &s;hattered by a war. The States were likewi&s;e the greate&s;t &s;trength of the Prote&s;tant intere&s;t, and were therefore to be humbled. So, in order to make the King more con&s;iderable both at home and abroad, the Court re&s;olved to prepare for a war, and to &s;eek for
<PB N="200" REF="215">
&s;uch colours as might &s;erve to ju&s;tify it. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> was not let into the &s;ecret of this de&s;ign, and was always again&s;t it. But his intere&s;t was now &s;unk low: And he began to feel the power of an imperious mi&s;tri&s;s over an amorous King, who was &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted at the Queen, that he abandoned him&s;elf wholly to amour and luxury.</P>
<P>This was, as far as I could penetrate into it, the &s;tate of the Court for the fir&s;t four years after the Re&s;toration. I was in the Court a great part of the years 1662, 1663, and 1664; and was as inqui&s;itive as I could po&s;&s;ibly be, and had more than ordina|ry occa&s;ions to hear and &s;ee a great deal.</P>
<P>But now I return to the affairs of <HI>Scotland:</HI> The Earl of <HI>Mid|letoun</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The affairs of <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> after a delay of &s;ome months came up to <HI>London,</HI> and was very coldly received by the King. The Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> moved that a <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Council might be called. The Lord <HI>Cla|rendon</HI> got this to be delayed a fortnight. When it met, the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Middletoun</HI> was accu&s;ed by <HI>Lauder|dale.</HI></NOTE> Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> accu&s;ed the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> of many mal|ver&s;ations in the great tru&s;t he had been in, which he aggra|vated &s;everely. The Lord <HI>Midletoun</HI> de&s;ired he might have what was objected to him in writing. And when he had it, he &s;ent it to <HI>Scotland;</HI> &s;o that it was &s;ix weeks before he had his an&s;wer ready; all on de&s;ign to gain time. He excu&s;ed &s;ome errours in point of form, by &s;aying, that, having &s;erved in a military way, he under&s;tood not &s;o exactly what belonged to law and form: But in&s;i&s;ted on this, that he de&s;igned nothing, but that the King's &s;ervice might go on, and that his friends might be taken care of, and his enemies be humbled, and that &s;o loyal a Parliament might be encouraged, who were full of zeal and affection to his &s;ervice; that, in complying with them, he had kept every thing &s;o entirely in his Maje&s;ty's power, that the King was under no difficulties by any thing they had done. In the mean while <HI>Shel|don</HI> was very earne&s;t with the King to forgive the Lord <HI>Midle|toun</HI>'s crime, otherwi&s;e he concluded the change &s;o newly made in the Church would be &s;o ill &s;upported, that it mu&s;t fall to the ground. The Duke of <HI>Albermarle,</HI> who knew <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had more credit on that head than on any other, pretended that the Lord <HI>Midletoun</HI>'s party was that on which the King could only rely: He magnified both their power and their zeal; and repre&s;ented the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s friends, as cold and hollow in the King's &s;ervice: And, to &s;upport all this, the letters that came from <HI>Scotland</HI> were full of the in&s;olencies of the Pre&s;byterians, and of the dejection the Bi&s;hops and their friends were under. <HI>Sharp</HI> was prevailed on to go up. He promi&s;ed to all the Earl of <HI>Mid|letoun</HI>'s friends, that he would &s;tick firm to him; and that he would lay before the King, that his &s;tanding or falling mu&s;t be
<PB N="201" REF="216">
the &s;tanding or falling of the Church. Of this the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> had advice &s;ent him. Yet when he came to <HI>London,</HI> and &s;aw that the King was alienated from the Lord <HI>Midletoun,</HI> he re&s;olved to make great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the Lord <HI>Lauderdale.</HI> When he reproached him for his engagements with the Earl of <HI>Midletoun,</HI> he denied all; and &s;aid, he had never gone farther than what was decent, con&s;idering his po&s;t. He al&s;o denied, he had writ to the King in his favour. But the King had giv|en the original letter to the Lord <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> who upon that &s;hewed it to <HI>Sharp;</HI> with which he was &s;o &s;truck, that he fell a crying in a mo&s;t abject manner. He begged pardon for it; and &s;aid, what could a company of poor men refu&s;e to the Earl of <HI>Midletoun,</HI> who had done &s;o much for them, and had them &s;o entirely in his power. The Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> upon this com|forted him; and &s;aid, he would forgive them all that was pa&s;t, and would &s;erve them and the Church at another rate than Lord <HI>Midletoun</HI> was capable of doing. So <HI>Sharp</HI> became wholly his. Of all this Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> gave me a full relation the next day; and &s;hewed me the papers that pa&s;s'd between Lord <HI>Midletoun</HI> and him. <HI>Sharp</HI> thought he had e&s;caped well. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> treated the Bi&s;hops too much as his creatures, and a&s;|&s;umed a great deal to him&s;elf, and expre&s;&s;ed a &s;ort of authority over them; which <HI>Sharp</HI> was unea&s;y under, tho' he dur&s;t not complain of it, or re&s;i&s;t it: Whereas he reckoned, that Lord <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> knowing the &s;u&s;picions that lay on him, as favour|ing the Pre&s;hyterians, would have le&s;s credit and courage in op|po&s;ing any thing that &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;upport. It proved that in this he judged right: For the Lord <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> that he might maintain him&s;elf at Court, and with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> was really more complaint and ea&s;y to every pro|po&s;ition that the Bi&s;hops made, than he would otherwi&s;e have been, if he had been always of the Epi&s;copal party. But all he did that way was again&s;t his heart, except when his pa&s;&s;ions were vehemently &s;tirred, which a very &s;light occa&s;ion would readily do.</P>
<P>When the Earls of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> and <HI>Midletoun</HI> had been writing papers and an&s;wers for above three months, an accident happened which ha&s;tened Lord <HI>Midletoun</HI>'s di&s;grace. The Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> laid before the King the unju&s;t proceedings in the laying on of the fines. And, to make all that party &s;ure to him&s;elf, he pro|cured a letter from the King to the Council in <HI>Scotland,</HI> order|ing them to i&s;&s;ue out a proclamation, for &s;uper&s;eding the executi|on of the Act of fining till farther order. The Privy Council being then for the greater part compo&s;ed of Lord <HI>Midletoun</HI>'s
<PB N="202" REF="217">
friends, it was pretended by &s;ome of them, that, as long as he was the King's Commi&s;&s;ioner, they could receive and execute no or|ders from the King, but thro' his hands. So they writ to him, de&s;iring him to repre&s;ent to the King, that this would be an af|front put on the proceedings of Parliament, and would rai&s;e the &s;pirits of a party that ought to be kept down. Lord <HI>Midletoun</HI> writ back, that he had laid the matter before the King; and that he, con&s;idering better of it, ordered, that no proceeding &s;hould be made upon his former letter. This occa&s;ioned a hot debate in Council. It was &s;aid, a letter under the King's hand could not be countermanded, but from the &s;ame hand. So the Council wrote to know the King's mind in the matter. The King prote&s;ted he knew nothing of it, and that Lord <HI>Midletoun</HI> had not &s;poke one word on the &s;ubject to him. He upon that &s;ent for him, and chid him &s;o &s;everely, that Lord <HI>Midletoun</HI> concluded from it that he was ruined. Yet he always &s;tood upon it, that he had the King's order by word of mouth for what he had done, tho' he was not &s;o cautious as to procure an in&s;truction under his hand for his warrant. It is very probable, that he &s;poke of it to the King, when his head was full of &s;omewhat el&s;e, &s;o that he did not mind it; and that, to get rid of the Earl of <HI>Midle|toun,</HI> he bid him do what&s;oever he propo&s;ed, without reflecting much on it. For the King was at that time often &s;o di&s;tracted in his thoughts, that he was not at all times ma&s;ter of him&s;elf. The Queen-mother had brought over from <HI>France</HI> one Mrs. <HI>Stew|ard,</HI> reckoned a very great beauty, who was afterwards married to the Duke of <HI>Richmond.</HI> The King was believed to be deeply in love with her. Yet his former Mi&s;tri&s;s kept her ground &s;till. And, what with her humours and jealou&s;y, and what with this new amour, the King had very little quiet, between both their pa&s;&s;ions and his own.</P>
<P>Towards the end of <HI>May</HI> the King called many of the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Coun&s;ellours together, and did order all the papers that had pa&s;&s;ed between the Earls of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> and <HI>Midletoun</HI> to be read to them. When that was done, many of them who were <HI>Midletoun</HI>'s friends &s;aid much in excu&s;e of his errors, and of the nece&s;&s;ity of continuing him &s;till in that high tru&s;t. But the King &s;aid, his errors were &s;o great and &s;o many, that the cre|dit of his affairs mu&s;t &s;uffer, if he continued them any longer in &s;uch hands. Yet he promi&s;ed them, he would be &s;till kind to him; for he looked on him as a very hone&s;t man. Few days after that, <NOTE PLACE="marg">And turned out of all.</NOTE> Secretary <HI>Morrice</HI> was &s;ent to him, with a warrant under the King's hand, requiring him to deliver up his commi&s;&s;ion, which he did. And &s;o his Mini&s;try came to an end, after a &s;ort of a reign of much violence and inju&s;tice: For he was become very imperious. He
<PB N="203" REF="218">
and his company were delivered up to &s;o much exce&s;s, and to &s;uch a madne&s;s of frolick and intemperance, that as <HI>Scotland</HI> had ne|ver &s;een any thing like it, &s;o upon this di&s;grace there was a ge|neral joy over the Kingdom: Tho' that la&s;ted not long; for tho&s;e that came after him grew wor&s;e than ever he was like to be. He had lived in great magnificence, which made him acceptable to many: And he was a firm friend, tho' a violent enemy. The Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> was declared the King's Commi&s;&s;ioner. But the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> would not tru&s;t him. So he went down with him, and kept him too vi&s;ibly in a dependence on him, for all his high character.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t things that was done in this &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parli|ament, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Warri&s;ton</HI> execution</NOTE> was the execution of my unfortunate uncle, <HI>Warri&s;ton.</HI> He was &s;o di&s;ordered both in body and mind, that it was a re|proach to a government to proceed again&s;t him: His memory was &s;o gone, that he did not know his own children. He was brought before the Parliament, to hear what he had to &s;ay, why his exe|cution &s;hould not be awarded. He &s;poke long, but in a broken and di&s;ordered &s;train, which his enemies fancied was put on to create pity. He was &s;entenced to die. His deportment was unequal, as might be expected from a man in his condition. Yet when the day of his execution came, he was very &s;erene. He was chearful, and &s;eemed fully &s;atisfied with his death. He read a &s;peech twice over on the &s;caffold, that to my knowledge he compo&s;ed him&s;elf, in which he ju&s;tified all the proceedings in the Covenant, and a&s;&s;erted his own &s;incerity; but condemned his joyning with <HI>Cromwell</HI> and the Sectaries, tho' even in that his intentions had been &s;incere, for the good of his Country, and the &s;ecurity of religion. Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> had lived in great friend&s;hip with him: But he &s;aw the King was &s;o &s;et again&s;t him, that he, who at all times took more care of him&s;elf than of his friends, would not in &s;o critical a time &s;eem to favour a man, whom the Pre&s;byterians had &s;et up as a &s;ort of an idol among them, and on whom they did depend more than on any other man then alive.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the Parliament went on as the Lord <HI>Lauder|dale</HI> directed. The whole proceeding in the matter of the bal|loting was laid open. It appeared, that the Parliament had not de&s;ired it, but had been led into it by being made believe that the King had a mind to it. And of all the members of Parlia|ment not above twelve could be prevailed on to own, that they had advi&s;ed the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> to a&s;k leave of the King for it, who&s;e private &s;ugge&s;tions he had repre&s;ented to the King as the de&s;ire of the Parliament. This fini&s;hed his di&s;grace, as
<PB N="204" REF="219">
well as it occa&s;ioned the putting all his party out of employ|ments.</P>
<P>While they were going on with their affairs, they under&s;tood that an Act had pa&s;s'd in the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> again&s;t all <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act a|gain&s;t Con|venticles.</NOTE> Conventicles, impowering Ju&s;tices of Peace to convict offenders without Juries; which was thought a great breach on the &s;ecu|rity of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> con&s;titution, and a rai&s;ing the power of Ju|&s;tices to a very arbitrary pitch. Any meeting for religious wor|&s;hip, at which five were pre&s;ent more than the family, was de|clared a Conventicle. And every per&s;on above &s;ixteen, that was pre&s;ent at it, was to lye three months in pri&s;on, or to pay 5 <HI>l.</HI> for the fir&s;t offence; &s;ix months for the &s;econd offence, or to pay 20 <HI>l.</HI> fine; and for the third offence, being convict by a Jury, was to be bani&s;hed to any plantation, except <HI>New England</HI> or <HI>Virginia,</HI> or to pay an 100 <HI>l.</HI> All people were amazed at this &s;everity. But the Bi&s;hops in <HI>Scotland</HI> took heart upon it, and re&s;olved to copy from it. So an Act pa&s;s'd there, almo&s;t in the &s;ame terms. And, at the pa&s;&s;ing it, Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> in a long &s;peech expre&s;&s;ed great zeal for the Church. There was &s;ome little oppo&s;ition made to it by the Earl of <HI>Kincardin,</HI> who was an enemy to all per&s;ecution. But, tho' &s;ome few voted again&s;t it, it was carried by a great majority.</P>
<P>Another Act pa&s;s'd, declaring the con&s;titution of a National Synod. It was to be compo&s;ed of the Archbi&s;hops and Bi&s;hops, of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The con&s;ti|tution of a National Synod.</NOTE> all Deans, and of two to be deputed from every Pre&s;bytery; of which the Moderator of the Pre&s;bytery named by the Bi&s;hop was to be one: All things were to be propo&s;ed to this Court by the King or his Commi&s;&s;ioner. And what&s;oever &s;hould be agreed to by the majority and the Pre&s;ident, the Archbi&s;hop of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> was to have the force of an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical law, when it &s;hould be confirmed by the King. Great exceptions were taken to this Act. The Church was re&s;trained from meddling with any thing, but as it &s;hould be laid before them by the King; which was thought a &s;evere re&s;traint, like that of the <HI>Proponentibus Legatis</HI> &s;o much complained of at <HI>Trent.</HI> The putting the negative, not in the whole bench of the Bi&s;hops, but &s;ingly in the Pre&s;ident, was thought very irregular. But it pa&s;s'd with &s;o little ob&s;ervation, that the Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> could &s;carce believe it was penned as he &s;ound it to be, when I told him of it. <HI>Primero&s;e</HI> told me, <HI>Sharp</HI> put that clau&s;e in with his own hand. The inferiour Clergy complained, that the power was wholly taken from them; &s;ince as one of their deputies was to be a per&s;on named by the Bi&s;hops, &s;o, the Moderators claiming a negative vote in their Pre&s;byteries as the Bi&s;hops delegates, the other half were only
<PB N="205" REF="220">
to con&s;i&s;t of Per&s;ons to whom they con&s;ented. The Act was indeed &s;o penned, that no body moved for a National Synod, when they &s;aw how it was to be con&s;tituted.</P>
<P>Two other Acts pa&s;s'd in favour of the Crown. The Parlia|ment of <HI>England</HI> had laid great impo&s;itions on all things im|ported from <HI>Scotland:</HI> So the Parliament, being &s;peedily to be di&s;&s;olved, and not having time to regulate &s;uch impo&s;itions on <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> goods, as might force the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to bring that matter to a ju&s;t balance, they put that confidence in the King, that they left the laying of impo&s;itions on all foreign merchandize wholly to him.</P>
<P>Another Act was looked on as a pompous complement: And &s;o <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act $span$ing an Army to the King.</NOTE> it pa&s;s'd without ob&s;ervation, or any oppo&s;ition. In it they made an offer to the King of an Army of twenty thou&s;and foot and two thou|&s;and hor&s;e, to be ready upon &s;ummons to march with forty days provi&s;ion into any part of his Maje&s;ty's dominions, to oppo&s;e inva&s;ions, to &s;uppre&s;s in&s;urrections, or for any other cau&s;e in which his authority, power, or greatne&s;s was concerned. No body dreamt, that any u&s;e was ever to be made of this. Yet the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> had his end in it, to let the King &s;ee what u&s;e he might make of <HI>Scotland,</HI> if he &s;hould intend to &s;et up ar|bitrary government in <HI>England.</HI> He told the King, that the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> and his party under&s;tood not, what was the greate&s;t &s;ervice that <HI>Scotland</HI> could do him: They had not much trea&s;ure to offer him: The only thing they were capable of do|ing was, to furni&s;h him with a good Army, when his affairs in <HI>England</HI> &s;hould require it. And of this he made great u&s;e after|wards to advance him&s;elf, tho' it could never have &s;ignified any thing to the advancing the King's ends. Yet &s;o ea&s;y was it to draw the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> to pa&s;s Acts of the greate&s;t con&s;e|quence in a hurry, without con&s;idering the effects they might have. After the&s;e Acts were pa&s;s'd, the Parliament was di&s;&s;olved; which gave a general &s;atisfaction to the countrey, for they were a furious &s;et of people. The government was left in the Earl of <HI>Glencairn</HI>'s hands, who began, now that he had little favour at Court, to &s;et him&s;elf on all occa&s;ions to oppo&s;e <HI>Sharp</HI>'s violent notions. The Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> &s;tuck firm to <HI>Sharp;</HI> and was re|commended by him to the Bi&s;hops of <HI>England,</HI> as the only man that &s;upported their intere&s;ts. The King at this time re&s;tored Lord <HI>Lorn</HI> to his Grand-father's honour, of being Earl of <HI>Angile,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing over his Father; and gave him a great part of his e&s;tate, leaving the re&s;t to be &s;old for the payment of debts, which did not rai&s;e in value above a third part of them. This occa&s;ion|ed a great outcry, that continued long to pur&s;ue him.</P>

<HI>Sharp</HI> went up to <HI>London</HI> to complain of the Lord <HI>Glencairn,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1664. <HI>Sharp</HI> drove very violent|ly.</NOTE> and of the Privy Council; where, he &s;aid, there was &s;uch a remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, and &s;o much popularity appeared on all occa&s;ions, that, unle&s;s &s;ome more &s;pirit were put in the admini&s;tration, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve the Church. That was the word always u&s;ed, as if there had been a charm in it. He moved, that a letter might be writ, giving him the precedence of the Lord Chancellour. This was thought an inexcu&s;able piece of vanity: For in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when there was no Commi&s;&s;ioner, all matters pa&s;s'd thro' the Lord Chancellour's hands, who by Act of Par|liament was to pre&s;ide in all Courts, and was con&s;idered as re|pre&s;enting the King's per&s;on. He al&s;o moved, that the King would grant a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion to &s;ome per&s;ons for executing the Laws relating to the Church. All the Privy Coun&s;ellours were to be of it. But to the&s;e he de&s;ired many others might be added, for whom he undertook, that they would execute them with zeal. Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> &s;aw that this would prove a High-Commi&s;&s;ion <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lauderdale</HI> gave way to a</NOTE> Court: Yet he gave way to it, tho' much again&s;t his own mind. Upon the&s;e things I took the liberty, tho' then too young to meddle in things of that kind, to expo&s;tulate very freely with him. I thought he was acting the Earl of <HI>Traquair</HI>'s part, giving way to all the follies of the Bi&s;hops on de&s;ign to ruine them. He upon that ran into a great deal of freedom with me: He told me many pa&s;&s;ages of <HI>Sharp</HI>'s pa&s;t life: He was per&s;uaded he would ruine all: But, he &s;aid, he was re&s;olved to give him line: For he had not credit enough to &s;top him; nor would he oppo&s;e any thing that he propo&s;ed, unle&s;s it were very extravagant: He &s;aw the Earl of <HI>Glencairn</HI> and he would be in a perpetual war: And it was indifferent to him, how matters might go between them: Things would run to a height: And then the King would of him&s;elf put a &s;top to their ca|rier: For the King &s;aid often, he was not Prie&s;t-ridden: He would not venture a war, nor travel again for any party. This was all that I could obtain from the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale.</HI> I Pre&s;&s;ed <HI>Sharp</HI> him&s;elf to think of more moderate methods.

I was much in his favour at fir&s;t, but could not hold it long: For as I had been bred up by my father to love liberty and moderation, &s;o I &s;pent the greate&s;t part of the year 1664 in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> which contributed not a little to root and fix me in tho&s;e principles.</P>
<P>I &s;aw much peace and quiet in <HI>Holland,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A view of the &s;tate of affairs in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> diver&s;ity of opinions among them; which was occa&s;ioned by the gentlene&s;s of the government, and the toleration that made all people ea&s;y and happy. An univer&s;al indu&s;try was &s;pread thro' the whole countrey. There was little a&s;piring to preferment in the State, becau&s;e little was to be got that way. They were then apprehending a war with <HI>England,</HI> and were preparing for it. From thence, where every thing was free, I went to <HI>France,</HI> where nothing was free. The King was beginning to put things in great method, in his revenue, in his troops, in his govern|ment at home, but above all in the increa&s;ing of trade, and the building of a great fleet. His own deportment was &s;olemn and grave, &s;ave only that he kept his Mi&s;tri&s;&s;es very avowedly. He was diligent in his own coun&s;els, and regular in the di&s;patch of his affairs: So that all things about him looked like the prepar|ing of matters for all that we have &s;een acted &s;ince. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> was con&s;idered as dying: And the infant his &s;on was like to die as &s;oon as he: So that it was generally believed, the <HI>French</HI> King was de&s;igning to &s;et up a new Empire in the <HI>We&s;t.</HI> He had carried the quarrel at <HI>Rome</HI> about the <HI>Cor&s;es</HI> &s;o high with the Hou&s;e of <HI>Ghigi,</HI> that the Prote&s;tants were be|ginning to flatter them&s;elves with great hopes. When I was in <HI>France,</HI> Cardinal <HI>Ghigi</HI> came, as Legate, to give the King full &s;atisfaction in that matter. Lord <HI>Hollis</HI> was then Amba&s;&s;adour at <HI>Paris.</HI> I was &s;o effectually recommended to him, that he u&s;ed me with great freedom, which he continued to do to the end of his days. He &s;tood upon all the points of an Amba&s;&s;a|dour with the &s;tiffne&s;s of former ages, which made him very unacceptable to a high|&s;pirited young Prince, who began even then to be flattered, as if he had been &s;omewhat more than a mortal. This e&s;tabli&s;hed me in my love of law and liberty, and in my hatred of ab&s;olute power. When I came back, I &s;tay it

for &s;ome months at Court, and ob&s;erved the &s;cene as carefully as I could, and became acquainted with all the men that were employed in <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> affairs. I had more than ordinary oppor|tunities of being well informed about them. This drew a jea|lou&s;y on me from the Bi&s;hops, which was increa&s;ed from the friend&s;hip into which <HI>Leightoun</HI> received me. I pa&s;s'd for one, who was no great friend to Church power, nor to per&s;ecution. So it was thought, that Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was preparing me, as one who was known to have been always Epi&s;copal, to be &s;et up again&s;t <HI>Sharp</HI> and his &s;et of men, who were much hated by one &s;ide, and not loved, nor tru&s;ted, by the other.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Earl of <HI>Glencairn</HI> died, which &s;et <HI>Sharp</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sharp</HI> a&s;pir|ed to be Chancellour of <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> at ea&s;e, but put him on new de&s;igns. He apprehended, that the Earl of <HI>Tweedale</HI> might be advanced to that po&s;t: For in the &s;ettlement of the Duche&s;s of <HI>Buccleugh</HI>'s e&s;tate, who was married to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> the be&s;t beloved of all the King's children, by which, in default of i&s;&s;ue by her, it was to go to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and the i&s;&s;ue he might have by any other wife, the Earl of <HI>Tweedale,</HI> tho's his children were the next heirs, who were by this depriv'd of their right, had yet given way to it in &s;o frank a manner, that the King was enough inclined both to oblige and to tru&s;t him. But <HI>Sharp</HI> had great &s;u&s;pici|ons of him, as cold in their concerns. So he writ to <HI>Sheldon,</HI> that upon the di&s;po&s;al of the &s;eals the very being of the Church did &s;o ab&s;olutely depend, that he begged he would pre&s;s the King very earne&s;tly in the matter, and that he would move that he might be called up before that po&s;t &s;hould be filled. The King bid <HI>Sheldon</HI> a&s;&s;ure him, he &s;hould take a &s;pecial care of that mat|ter, but that there was no occa&s;ion for his coming up: For the King by this time had a very ill opinion of him. <HI>Sharp</HI> was &s;o mortified with this, that he re&s;olved to put all to hazard; for he believed all was at &s;take: And he ventured to come up. The King received him coldly; and a&s;ked him, if he had not received the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI>'s letter. He &s;aid, he had: But he would choo&s;e rather to venture on his Maje&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure, than to &s;ee the Church ruined thro' his caution or negligence: He knew the danger they were in in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they had but few and cold friends, and many violent enemies: His Maje&s;ty's protection, and the execution of the law, were the only things they could tru&s;t to: And the&s;e &s;o much depended on the good choice of a Chancellour, that he could not an&s;wer it to God and the Church, if he did not be&s;tir him&s;elf in that matter: He knew many thought of him&s;elf for that po&s;t: But he was &s;o far from that thought, that, if his Maje&s;ty had any &s;uch intention,
<PB N="209" REF="224">
he would rather choo&s;e to be &s;ent to a plantation: He de&s;ired, that he might be a Church-man in heart, but not in habit, that &s;hould be rai&s;ed to that tru&s;t. The&s;e were his very words, as the King reported them. From him he went to <HI>Sheldon,</HI> and pre&s;s'd him to move the King for him&s;elf, and furni&s;hed him with many rea&s;ons to &s;upport the propo&s;ition; a main one be|ing, that the late King had rai&s;ed his predece&s;&s;or <HI>Spot&s;wood</HI> to that tru&s;t. <HI>Sheldon</HI> upon that did move the King with more than ordinary earne&s;tne&s;s in it. The King &s;u&s;pected <HI>Sharp</HI> had &s;et him on, and charged him to tell him the truth. The other did it, tho' not without &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s. Upon that the King told him what he had &s;aid to him&s;elf. And then it may be ea&s;ily imagined in what a &s;tyle they both &s;poke of him. Yet <HI>Sheldon</HI> prayed the King that, what&s;oever he might think of the man, he would con&s;ider the Archbi&s;hop and the Church; which the King a&s;&s;ured him he would do. <HI>Sheldon</HI> told <HI>Sharp,</HI> that he &s;aw the motion for him&s;elf did not take; &s;o he mu&s;t think of &s;ome|what el&s;e. <HI>Sharp</HI> propo&s;ed, that the &s;eals might be put in the Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI>'s hands, till the King &s;hould pitch on a proper per&s;on. He al&s;o propo&s;ed, that the King would make him his Commi&s;|&s;ioner, in order to the preparing matters for a National Synod, that they might &s;ettle a book of Common-prayer, and a book of Canons. This, he &s;aid, mu&s;t be carried on &s;lowly, and with great caution; of which the late troubles did demon&s;trate the ne|ce&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>All this was ea&s;ily agreed to: For the King loved the Lord <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rothes</HI> had the whole power of <HI>Scotland</HI> put in his hands.</NOTE> <HI>Rothes:</HI> And the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> would not oppo&s;e his ad|vancement: Tho' it was a very extravagant thing to &s;ee one man po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o many of the chief places of &s;o poor a Kingdom. The Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> would not abjure the Covenant: So he had been made Lord Trea&s;urer in his place: He continued to be &s;till, what he was before, Lord Pre&s;ident of the Council: And, upon the Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI>'s di&s;grace, he was made Captain of a troop of guards: And now he was both the King's Commi&s;&s;ioner, and upon the matter Lord Chancellour. <HI>Sharp</HI> reckoned this was his ma&s;ter-piece. Lord <HI>Rothes,</HI> being thus advanced by his means, was in all things governed by him. His in&s;tructions were &s;uch as <HI>Sharp</HI> propo&s;ed, to prepare matters for a National Synod, and in the mean while to execute the Laws that related to the Church with a &s;teddy firmne&s;s. So, when he parted from <HI>White-hall, Sharp</HI> &s;aid to the King, that he had now done all that could be de&s;ired of him for the good of the Church: So that, if all matters went not right in <HI>Scotland,</HI> none mu&s;t bear the blame, but either the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> or <HI>Rothes.</HI> And &s;o they came
<PB N="210" REF="225">
to <HI>Scotland,</HI> where a very furious &s;cene of illegal violence was opened. <HI>Sharp</HI> governed Lord <HI>Rothes,</HI> who abandoned him&s;elf to plea&s;ure. And, when &s;ome cen&s;ured this, all the an&s;wer that was made was, a &s;evere piece of raillery, that the King's Com|mi&s;&s;ioner ought to repre&s;ent his per&s;on.</P>
<P>The government of <HI>Scotland</HI> as to civil matters was very ea|&s;y. <NOTE PLACE="marg">1665. Illegal and &s;evere pro+ceedings in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> All were quiet and obedient. But all tho&s;e Counties that lye towards the <HI>$span$e&s;t</HI> became very fierce and intractable: And the whole work of the Council was to deal with them, and to &s;ubdue them. It was not ea&s;y to prove any thing again&s;t any of them, for they did &s;tick firm to one another. The people com|plained of the new &s;et of Mini&s;ters, that was &s;ent among them, as immoral, &s;tupid, and ignorant. Generally they for&s;ook their Churches. And, if any of them went to Church, they &s;aid, they were little edified with their &s;ermons. And the whole country was full of &s;trange reports of the weakne&s;s of their preaching, and of the indecency of their whole deportment. The people treated them with great contempt, and with an aver&s;ion that broke out often into violence and inju&s;tice. But their Mini&s;ters on their parts were not wanting in their complaints, aggravating matters, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Bi&s;hops with many &s;tories of de&s;igns and plottings again&s;t the State. So, many were brought before the Council, and the new Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Commi&s;&s;ion, for pretended riots, and for u&s;ing their Mini&s;ters ill, but chiefly for not com|ing to Church, and for holding Conventicles. The proofs were often defective, and lay rather in pre&s;umptions, than clear evi|dence: And the puni&s;hments propo&s;ed were often arbitrary, not warranted by law. So the Judges and other lawyers, that were of tho&s;e Courts, were careful to keep proceedings according to forms of law: Upon which <HI>Sharp</HI> was often complaining, that favour was &s;hown to the enemies of the Church, under the pre|tence of law. It was &s;aid, that the people of the countrey were in &s;uch a combination, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to find witne&s;&s;es to prove things fully: And he often &s;aid, mu&s;t the Church be ru|ined for punctilio's of law? When he could not carry matters by a vote, as he had a mind, he u&s;ually looked to the Earl of <HI>Rothes;</HI> who upon that was ever ready to &s;ay, he would take it upon him to order the matter as <HI>Sharp</HI> propo&s;ed, and would do it in the King's name. Great numbers were ca&s;t in pri&s;on, where they were kept long, and ill u&s;ed: And &s;ometimes they were fined, and the younger &s;ort whipt about the &s;treets. The people grew more $$llen on all this ill u&s;age. Many were undone by it, and went over to the <HI>Scots</HI> in <HI>Ul&s;ter,</HI> where they were
<PB N="211" REF="226">
well received, and had all manner of liberty as to their way of religion.</P>
<P><HI>Burnet</HI> was &s;ent up to po&s;&s;e&s;s the King with the apprehen&s;i|ons of a rebellion in the beginning of the <HI>Dutch</HI> war. He pro|po&s;ed that about twenty of the chief gentlemen of tho&s;e Coun|ties might be &s;ecured: And he undertook for the peace of the countrey, if they were clap'd up. This was plainly illegal. But the Lord <HI>Landerdale</HI> oppo&s;ed nothing. So it was done: But with a very ill effect. For tho&s;e Gentlemen, knowing how obnoxious they were, had kept mea&s;ures a little better: But they being put in pri&s;on, both their friends and tenants laid all to the door of the Clergy, and hated them the more, and u&s;ed them the wor&s;e for it. The Earls of <HI>Argile, Tweedale,</HI> and <HI>Kin|cardin,</HI> who were con&s;idered as the Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s chief friends, were cold in all tho&s;e matters. They &s;tudied to keep proceed|ings in a legal channel, and were for moderate cen&s;ures. Upon which <HI>Sharp</HI> &s;aid, they appeared to be the friends and favourers of the enemies of the Church.</P>
<P>Wherever the people had generally for&s;aken their Churches, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Turner</HI> exe|cuted the laws in a mi|litary may.</NOTE> the guards were quartered thro' the countrey. Sir <HI>James Turner,</HI> that commanded them, was naturally fierce, but was mad when he was drunk; and that was very often. So he was ordered by the Lord <HI>Rothes</HI> to act according to &s;uch directions as <HI>Burnet</HI> &s;hould &s;end him. And he went about the countrey, and re|ceived &s;uch li&s;ts, as the Mini&s;ters brought him, of tho&s;e who came not to Church: And, without any other proof or any legal conviction, he &s;et &s;uch a fine on them, as he thought they could pay, and &s;ent &s;oldiers to lie on them till it was paid. I knew him well afterwards, when he came to him&s;elf, being out of em|ployment. He was a learned man; but had been always in ar|mies, and knew no other rule but to obey orders. He told me, he had no regard to any law, but acted, as he was commanded, in a military way. He confe&s;&s;ed, it went often again&s;t the grain with him to &s;erve &s;uch a debauched and worthle&s;s company, as the Clergy generally were; and that &s;ometimes he did not act up to the rigour of his orders; for which he was often chid, both by Lord <HI>Rothes</HI> and <HI>Sharp,</HI> but was never check'd for his illegal and violent proceedings. And, tho' the complaints of him were very high, &s;o that, when he was afterwards &s;eized on by the party, they intended to make a &s;acrifice of him; yet when they looked into his orders, and found that his proceedings, how fierce &s;oever, fell &s;hort of the&s;e, they &s;pared him, as a man that had merited by being &s;o gentle among them.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="227">
The truth is, the whole face of the government looked liker the proceedings of an inqui&s;ition, than of legal Courts: And yet <HI>Sharp</HI> was never &s;atisfied. So Lord <HI>Rothes</HI> and he went up to Court in the fir&s;t year of the <HI>Dutch</HI> war. When they waited fir&s;t on the King, <HI>Sharp</HI> put him in mind of what he had &s;aid at his la&s;t parting, that if their matters went not well, none mu&s;t be blamed for it, but either the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> or of <HI>Rothes:</HI> And now he came to tell his Maje&s;ty, that things were wor&s;e than over: And he mu&s;t do the Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, he had done his part. Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was all on fire at this, but dur&s;t not give him&s;elf vent before the King. So he only de&s;ired, that <HI>Sharp</HI> would come to particulars: And then he &s;hould know what he had to &s;ay. <HI>Sharp</HI> put that off in a general charge; and &s;aid, he knew the party &s;o well, that, if they were not &s;up|ported by &s;ecret encouragements, they would have been long ago weary of the oppo&s;ition they gave the government. The King had no mind to enter farther into their complaints. So Lord <HI>Rothes</HI> and he withdrew; and were ob&s;erved to look very plea&s;antly upon one another, as they went away. Lord <HI>Lauder|dale</HI> told the King, he was now accu&s;ed to his face: But he would quickly let him &s;ee what a man <HI>Sharp</HI> was. So he obtained a me&s;&s;age from the King to him, of which he him&s;elf was to be the bearer, requiring him to put his complaints in writing, and to come to particulars. He followed <HI>Sharp</HI> home, who receiv|ed him with &s;uch a gayity, as if he had given him no provoca|tion. But Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was more &s;olemn; and told him, it was the King's plea&s;ure, that he &s;hould put the accu&s;ation with which he had charged him in writing. <HI>Sharp</HI> pretended, he did not comprehend his meaning. He an&s;wered, the matter was plain: He had accu&s;ed him to the King: And he mu&s;t ei|ther go thorough with it, and make it out, otherwi&s;e he would charge him with lea&s;ing-making: And &s;poke in a terrible tone to him. Upon that, as he told me, <HI>Sharp</HI> fell a trembling and weeping: He prote&s;ted, he meant no harm to him: He was only &s;orry that his friends were upon all occa&s;ions pleading for favour to the <HI>Fanaticks:</HI> (That was become the name of re|proach.) Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> &s;aid, that would not &s;erve turn: He was not an&s;werable for his friends, except when they acted by directions from him. <HI>Sharp</HI> offer'd to go with him pre&s;ently to the King, and to clear the whole matter. Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> had no mind to break openly with him. So he accepted of this, and carried him to the King; where he retracted all he had &s;aid, in &s;o gro&s;s a manner, that the King &s;aid afterwards, Lord <HI>Lauder|dale</HI>
<PB N="213" REF="228">
was ill natured to pre&s;s it &s;o heavily, and to force <HI>Sharp</HI> on giving him&s;elf the lye in &s;uch cour&s;e terms.</P>
<P>This went to <HI>Sharp</HI>'s heart: So he made a propo&s;ition to the Earl <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sharp</HI> &s;tudies to bring <HI>Midletoun</HI> into bu&s;ine&s;s again.</NOTE> of <HI>Dunfreis,</HI> who was a great friend of the Lord <HI>Midletoun</HI>'s, to try if a reconciliation could be made between him and the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> and if he would be content to come into the government under Lord <HI>Rothes.</HI> Lord <HI>Dunfreis</HI> went into <HI>Kent,</HI> where the Lord <HI>Mid|letoun</HI> was then employed in a military command on the account of the war: And he laid <HI>Sharp</HI>'s propo&s;ition before him. The Earl of <HI>Midletoun</HI> gave Lord <HI>Dunfreis</HI> power to treat in his name; but &s;aid, he knew <HI>Sharp</HI> too well to regard any thing that came from him. Before Lord <HI>Dunfreis</HI> came back, <HI>Sharp</HI> had tried Lord <HI>Rothes,</HI> but found he would not meddle in it: And they both under&s;tood, that the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s intere&s;t was declining, and that the King was like to change his mea&s;ures. So when Lord <HI>Dunfreis</HI> came back to give <HI>Sharp</HI> an account of his negotiation, he &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed, and denied he had given him any &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion. This enrag|ed the Earl of <HI>Dunfreis</HI> &s;o, that he publi&s;hed the thing in all com|panies: Among others he told it very particularly to my &s;elf.</P>
<P>At that time <HI>Leightoun</HI> was prevailed on to go to Court, and to give the King a true account of the proceedings in <HI>Scotland;</HI> which, he &s;aid, were &s;o violent, that he could not concur in the planting the Chri&s;tian religion it &s;elf in &s;uch a manner, much le&s;s a form of government. He therefore begged leave to quit his Bi&s;hoprick, and to retire: For he thought he was in &s;ome &s;ort acce&s;&s;ory to the violences done by others, &s;ince he was one of them, and all was pretended to be done to e&s;tab|li&s;h them and their order. There were indeed no violences com|mitted in his dioce&s;e. He went round it continually every year, preaching and catechizing from pari&s;h to pari&s;h. He conti|nued in his private and a&s;cetick cour&s;e of life, and gave all his income, beyond the &s;mall expence of his own per&s;on, to the poor. He &s;tudied to rai&s;e in his Clergy a greater &s;en&s;e of &s;piritu|al matters, and of the care of &s;ouls; and was in all re&s;pects a burning and &s;hining light, highly e&s;teemed by the greater part of his dioce&s;e: Even the Pre&s;byterians were much mollified, if not quite overcome, by his mild and heavenly cour&s;e of life. The King &s;eemed touched with the &s;tate that the countrey was in: He &s;poke very &s;everely of <HI>Sharp;</HI> and a&s;&s;ured <HI>Leightoun,</HI> he would quickly come to other mea&s;ures, and put a &s;top to tho&s;e violent methods: But he would by no means &s;uffer him to quit his Bi&s;hoprick. So the King gave orders that the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Commi&s;&s;ion &s;hould be di&s;continued; and &s;ignified his plea&s;ure, that another way of proceeding was nece&s;&s;ary for his affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="229">
He under&s;tood by his intelligence from <HI>Holland,</HI> that the ex|iles at <HI>Rotterdam</HI> were very bu&s;y, and that perhaps the <HI>Dutch</HI> might furni&s;h the malecontents of <HI>Scotland</HI> with money and arms: <NOTE PLACE="marg">More forces rais'd in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> So he thought it was nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e more troops. Two gal|lant officers, that had &s;erved him in the wars, and, when the&s;e were over, had gone with his letters to &s;erve in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> where one of them, <HI>Dalziell,</HI> was rai&s;ed to be a General, and the other, <HI>Drumond,</HI> was advanced to be a Lieutenant General, and Governour of <HI>Smolen&s;ko,</HI> were now, not without great difficulty, &s;ent back by the <HI>Czar.</HI> So the King intended they &s;hould com|mand &s;ome forces that he was to rai&s;e. <HI>Sharp</HI> was very appre|hen&s;ive of this: But the King was po&s;itive. A little before this, the Act of fining, that had lain &s;o long a&s;leep that it was thought forgot, was revived. And all who had been fined were required to bring in one moiety of their fines: But the other moiety was forgiven tho&s;e who took the Declaration renouncing the Cove|nant. The money was by Act of Parliament to be given among tho&s;e who had &s;erved, and &s;uffered for the King; &s;o that the King had only the tru&s;t of di&s;tributing it. There was no more <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Councils called at <HI>White-Hall</HI> after Lord <HI>Midletoun</HI>'s fall. But upon particular occa&s;ions the King ordered the Privy Coun|&s;ellours of that Kingdom, that were about the town, to be brought to him: Before whom he now laid out the nece&s;&s;ity of rai&s;ing &s;ome more force for &s;ecuring the quiet of <HI>Scotland:</HI> He only a&s;ked their advice, how they &s;hould be paid. <HI>Sharp</HI> very readily &s;aid, the money rai&s;ed by the fining was not yet di&s;po&s;ed of: So he propo&s;ed the applying it to that u&s;e. None oppo&s;ed this: So it was re&s;olved on. And by that means the Cava|liers, who were come up with their preten&s;ions, were di&s;ap|pointed of their la&s;t hopes of being recompen&s;ed for their &s;uf|ferings. The blame of all this was ca&s;t upon <HI>Sharp,</HI> at which they were out of mea&s;ure enraged, and charged him with it. He denied it boldly. But the King publi&s;hed it &s;o openly, that he dur&s;t not contradict him. Many, to whom he had denied that he knew any thing of the matter, and called that advice diabolical invention, affirmed it to the King. And the Lord <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> to compleat his di&s;grace with the King, got many of his letters, which he had writ to the Pre&s;byterians after the time in which the King knew that he was negotiating for Epi&s;|copacy, in which he had continued to prote&s;t with what zeal he was &s;oliciting their concerns, not without dreadful imprecations on him&s;elf if he was prevaricating with them, and laid the&s;e be|fore the King: So that the King looked on him as one of the wor&s;t of men.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="230">
Many of the Epi&s;copal Clergy in <HI>Scotland</HI> were much offend|ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">1666. Some emi|nent Cler|gy-men in <HI>Scotland</HI> of|fended at the&s;e pro|ceedings.</NOTE> at all the&s;e proceedings. They &s;aw the prejudices of the peo|ple were increa&s;ed by them. They hated violent cour&s;es, and thought they were contrary to the meek &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, and that they alienated the Nation more from the Church. They &s;et them&s;elves much to read Church-hi&s;tory, and to ob&s;erve the &s;tate of the Primitive Church, and the &s;pirit of tho&s;e times: And they could not but ob&s;erve &s;o great a difference between the con&s;titution of the Church under tho&s;e Bi&s;hops and our own, that they &s;eemed to agree in nothing but the name. I happen|ed to be &s;ettled near two of the mo&s;t eminent of them, who were often moved to accept of Bi&s;hopricks, but always refu&s;ed them, both out of a true principle of humility and &s;elf-denial, and al&s;o becau&s;e they could not engage in the methods by which things were carried on. One of the&s;e, Mr. <HI>Nairn,</HI> was one of the polite&s;t Clergy-men I ever knew bred in <HI>Scotland.</HI> He had formed clear and lively &s;chemes of things, and was the mo&s;t eloquent of all our preachers. He con&s;idered the pa&s;toral func|tion as a dedication of the whole man to God and his &s;ervice. He read the moral philo&s;ophers much; and had wrought him|&s;elf into their equal temper, as much as could con&s;i&s;t with a great deal of fire that was in his own: But he turned it all to melting devotion. He had a true notion of &s;uper&s;tition, as a narrow|ne&s;s of &s;oul, and a meanne&s;s of thought in religion. He &s;tudi|ed to rai&s;e all that conver&s;ed with him to great notions of God, and to an univer&s;al charity. This made him pity the Pre&s;byte|rians, as men of low notions and ill tempers. He had indeed too much heat of imagination, which carried him to be very po&s;itive in &s;ome things, in which he afterwards changed his mind: And that made him pa&s;s for an incon&s;tant man. In a word, he was the brighte&s;t man I ever knew among all our <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Divines. Another of the&s;e was Mr. <HI>Charteris,</HI> a man of a compo&s;ed and &s;erene gravity, but without affectation or &s;ourne&s;s. He &s;carce ever &s;poke in company, but was very open and free in private. He made true judgments of things, and of men; and had a pe|culiar talent in managing &s;uch as he thought de&s;erved his pains. He had little heat, either in body or mind: For as he had a mo&s;t emaciated body, &s;o he &s;poke both &s;low, and in &s;o low a voice that he could not ea&s;ily be heard. He had great tender|ne&s;s in his temper; and was a very perfect friend, and a mo&s;t &s;ublime Chri&s;tian. He lived in a con&s;tant contempt of the world, and a neglect of his per&s;on. There was a gravity in his conver&s;ation that rai&s;ed an attention, and begot a compo&s;edne&s;s,
<PB N="216" REF="231">
in all about him, without frightening them; for he made reli|gion appear amiable in his whole deportment. He had read all the lives and the epi&s;tles of great men very carefully. He had read the fathers much; and gave me this notion of them, that in &s;pecu|lative points, for which writers of Controver&s;y &s;earched into their works, they were but ordinary men: But their excellency lay in that, which was lea&s;t &s;ought for, their &s;en&s;e of &s;piritual things, and of the pa&s;toral care. In the&s;e he thought their &s;trength lay. And he often lamented, not without &s;ome indig|nation, that, in the di&s;putes about the government of the Church, much pains was taken to &s;eek out all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages that &s;hewed what their opinions were; but that due care was not taken to &s;et out the notions that they had of the &s;acred function, of the preparation of mind, and inward vocation, with which men ought to come to holy orders, or of the &s;trictne&s;s of life, the deadne&s;s to the world, the heavenly temper, and the con&s;tant application to the doing of good, that became them. Of the&s;e he did not talk like an angry reformer, that &s;et up in that &s;train, becau&s;e he was neglected or provoked; but like a man full of a deep, but humble &s;en&s;e of them. He was a great enemy to large con|fe&s;&s;ions of faith, chiefly when they were impo&s;ed in the lump as te&s;ts: For he was po&s;itive in very few things. He had gone thro' the chief parts of learning: But was then mo&s;t conver&s;ant in hi&s;tory, as the innocente&s;t &s;ort of &s;tudy, that did not fill the mind with &s;ubtilty, but helped to make a man wi&s;er and better. The&s;e were both &s;ingle per&s;ons, and men of great &s;obriety: And they lived in a con&s;tant low diet, which they valued more than &s;everer fa&s;ting. Yet they both became mi&s;erable by the &s;tone. <HI>Nairn</HI> went to <HI>Paris,</HI> where he was cut of a great one, of which he recovered, but lived not many years after. <HI>Charteris</HI> lived to a great age, and died in the end of the year 1700, having in his la&s;t years &s;uffered un&s;peakable torment from the &s;tone, which the operators would not venture to cut. But all that &s;aw what he &s;uffered, and how he bore it, acknowledged that in him they &s;aw a mo&s;t perfect pattern of patience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of God. It was a great happine&s;s for me, after I had broke into the world by &s;uch a ramble as I had made, that I fell in|to &s;uch hands, with whom I entered into a clo&s;e and particular friend&s;hip. They both &s;et me right, and kept me right; tho' I made at this time a $alley that may be mentioned, &s;ince it had &s;ome relation to publick affairs. I ob&s;erved the deportment of our Bi|&s;hops was in all points &s;o different from what became their func|tion, that I had a more than ordinary zeal kindled within me upon it. They were not only furious again&s;t all that &s;tood out
<PB N="217" REF="232">
again&s;t them, but were very remi&s;s in all the parts of their func|tion. Some did not live within their dioce&s;e. And tho&s;e who did &s;eemed to take no care of them: They &s;hewed no zeal again&s;t vice: The mo&s;t eminently wicked in the County were their par|ticular confidents: They took no pains to keep their Clergy &s;trictly to rules, and to their duty: On the contrary there was a levity and a carnal way of living about them, that very much &s;candalized me. There was indeed one <HI>Scougal,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> that was a man of rare temper, great piety and prudence: But I thought he was too much under <HI>Sharp</HI>'s con|duct, and was at lea&s;t too ea&s;y to him.</P>
<P>Upon all this I took a re&s;olution of drawing up a memorial <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some of the grievances of the Cler|gy laid be|fore the Bi|&s;hops.</NOTE> of the grievances we lay under by the ill conduct of our Bi&s;hops. I re&s;olved, that no other per&s;on be&s;ides my &s;elf &s;hould have a &s;hare in any trouble it might bring on me: So I communicated it to none. This made it not to be in all the parts of it &s;o well dige&s;ted, as it otherwi&s;e might have been: And I was then but three and twenty. I laid my foundation in the con&s;titution of the primitive Church; and &s;hewed how they had departed from it, by their neglecting their dioce&s;e, medling &s;o much in &s;ecular affairs, rai&s;ing their families out of the revenues of the Church, and above all by their violent pro&s;ecuting of tho&s;e who differ'd from them. Of this I writ out &s;ome copies, and &s;igned them, and &s;ent them to all the Bi&s;hops of my acquaintance. <HI>Sharp</HI> was much alarmed at it, and fancied I was &s;et on to it by &s;ome of the Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s friends. I was called before the Bi&s;hops, and treated with great &s;everity. <HI>Sharp</HI> called it a libel. I &s;aid, I had &s;et my name to it, &s;o it could not be called a libel. He charged me with the pre&s;umption of offering to teach my &s;upe|riours. I &s;aid, &s;uch things had been not only done, but ju&s;tified in all ages. He charged me for reflecting on the King's putting them on his Coun&s;els: I &s;aid, I found no fault with the King for calling them to his coun&s;els. But with them for going out of that which was their proper province, and for giving ill coun|&s;el. Then he charged me for reflecting on &s;ome &s;everities, which, he &s;aid, was a reproaching publick Courts, and a cen|&s;uring the laws. I &s;aid, laws might be made <HI>in te$$orem,</HI> not always fit to be executed: But I only complained of Clergy-mens pre&s;&s;ing the rigorous execution of them, and going often beyond what the law dictated. He broke out into a great vehemence; and propo&s;ed to the Bi&s;hops, that I &s;hould be &s;ummarily depriv|ed, and excommunicated: Put none of them would agree to that. By this management of his the thing grew publick. What I had ventured on was variou&s;ly cen&s;ured: But the greater part
<PB N="218" REF="233">
approved of it. Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> and all his friends were de|lighted with it: And he gave the King an account of it, who was not ill plea&s;ed at it. Great pains was taken to make me a&s;k pardon, but to no purpo&s;e: So <HI>Sharp</HI> let the thing fall. But, that it might appear that I had not done it upon any factious de&s;ign, I entered into a very clo&s;e &s;tate of retirement; and gave my &s;elf wholly to my &s;tudy, and the duties of my function.</P>
<P>Thus I have run over the &s;tate of <HI>Scotland</HI> in the years, 1663, 1664, 1665, and till near the end of 1666. I now return to the affairs of <HI>England;</HI> in which I mu&s;t write more defective|ly, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> being then &s;o far from the &s;cene. In winter 1664, the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> war.</NOTE> King declared his re&s;olution of entring into a war with the <HI>Dutch.</HI> The grounds were &s;o &s;light, that it was vi&s;ible there was &s;ome|what more at bottom, than was openly owned. A great comet, which appeared that winter, rai&s;ed the apprehen&s;ions of tho&s;e, who did not enter into ju&s;t &s;peculations concerning tho&s;e mat|ters. The Hou&s;e of Commons was &s;o far from examining nice|ly into the grounds of the war, that without any difficulty they gave the King two millions and a half for carrying it on. A great fleet was &s;et out, which the Duke commanded in per&s;on; as <HI>Opdam</HI> had the command of the <HI>Dutch</HI> fleet. But as &s;oon as the war broke out, a mo&s;t terrible Plague broke out al&s;o in the city of <HI>London,</HI> that &s;cattered all the inhabitants that were <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Plague broke out at the &s;ame time</NOTE> able to remove them&s;elves el&s;ewhere. It broke the trade of the Nation, and &s;wept away about an hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls; the greate&s;t havock that any Plague had ever made in <HI>England.</HI> This did di&s;hearten all people: And, coming in the very time in which &s;o unju&s;t a war was begun, it had a dreadful appearance. All the King's enemies, and the enemies of Monarchy &s;aid, here was a manife&s;t character of God's heavy di&s;plea&s;ure upon the Na|tion; as indeed the ill life the King led, and the viciou&s;ne&s;s of the whole Court, gave but a melancholy pro&s;pect. Yet God's ways are not as our ways. What all had &s;een in the year 1660 ought to have &s;ilenced tho&s;e, who at this time pretended to com|ment on providence. But there will be always much di&s;cour&s;e of things that are very vi&s;ible, as well as very extraordinary.</P>
<P>When the two fleets met, it is well known what acci|dents <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> di&s;ordered the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and what advantage the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had. If that fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s had been followed, as was propo&s;ed, it might have been fatal to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who finding they had &s;uffered &s;o much &s;teered off. The Duke ordered all the &s;ail to be &s;et on to overtake them. There was a Council of war called, to concert the method of action, when they &s;hould come up
<PB N="219" REF="234">
with them. In that Council <HI>Pen,</HI> who commanded under the Duke, happened to &s;ay, that they mu&s;t prepare for hotter work in the next engagement. He knew well the courage of the <HI>Dutch</HI> was never &s;o high, as when they were de&s;perate. The Earl of <HI>Montague,</HI> who was then a voluntier, and one of the Duke's Court, &s;aid to me, it was very vi&s;ible that made an impre&s;&s;ion. And all the Duke's dome&s;ticks &s;aid, he had got honour enough: Why &s;hould he venture a &s;econd time? The Duche&s;s had al&s;o given a &s;trict charge to all the Duke's &s;ervants, to do all they could to hinder him to engage too far. When matters were &s;ettled, they went to &s;leep: And the Duke ordered a call to be given him, when they &s;hould get up to the <HI>Dutch</HI> fleet. It is not known what pa&s;s'd between the Duke and <HI>Brounker,</HI> who was of his Bed-chamber, and was then in waiting: But he came to <HI>Pen,</HI> as from the Duke, and &s;aid, the Duke ordered the &s;ail to be &s;lackened. <HI>Pen</HI> was &s;truck with the order; but did not go to argue the matter with the Duke him&s;elf, as he ought to have done, but obey'd it. When the Duke had &s;lept, he, upon his waking, went out on the quarter-deck, and &s;eemed amazed to &s;ee the &s;ails &s;lackened, and that thereby all hope of overtaking the <HI>Dutch</HI> was lo&s;t. He que&s;tioned <HI>Pen</HI> upon it. <HI>Pen</HI> put it on <HI>Brounker,</HI> who &s;aid nothing. The Duke denied, he had given any &s;uch order. But he neither puni&s;hed <HI>Brounker</HI> for carrying it, nor <HI>Pen</HI> for obeying it. He indeed put <HI>Brounker</HI> out of his &s;ervice: And it was &s;aid, that he dur&s;t do no more, becau&s;e he was &s;o much in the King's favour, and in the Mi&s;tri&s;s's. <HI>Pen</HI> was more in his favour after that, than ever before, which he continued to his &s;on after him, tho' a Quaker: And it was thought, that all that favour was to oblige him to keep the &s;e|cret. Lord <HI>Montague</HI> did believe, that the Duke was &s;truck, &s;eeing the Earl of <HI>$almo$th,</HI> the King's favourite, and two other per&s;ons of quality, killed very near him; and that he had no mind to engage again, and that <HI>Pen</HI> was privately with him. If <HI>Brounker</HI> was &s;o much in fault, as he &s;eemed to be, it was thought, the Duke, in the pa&s;&s;ion that this mu&s;t have rai&s;ed in him, would have proceeded to greater extremities, and not have acted with &s;o much phlegm. This proved the breaking the de&s;igns of the King's whole reign: For the <HI>Dutch</HI> them&s;elves believed that, if our fleet had followed them with full &s;ail, we mu&s;t have come up with them next tide, and have either &s;unk or taken their whole fleet. <HI>De Wit</HI> was &s;truck with this misfor|tune: And, imputing &s;ome part of it to errors in conduct, he re|&s;olved to go on board him&s;elf, as &s;oon as their fleet was ready to go to &s;ea again.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="235">
Upon this occa&s;ion I will &s;ay a little of him, and of the af|fairs of <HI>Holland.</HI> His father was the deputy of the town of <HI>Dort</HI> in the States, when the late Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was &s;o much <NOTE PLACE="marg">An account of the affairs in <HI>Holland.</HI></NOTE> offended with their proceedings in di&s;banding a great part of their Army: And he was one of tho&s;e whom he ordered upon that to be carried to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Love&s;tein.</HI> Soon after that, his de&s;ign on <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> mi&s;carrying, he &s;aw a nece&s;&s;ity of mak|ing up the be&s;t he could with the States. But, before he had quite healed that wound, he died of the &s;mall-pox. Upon his death all his party fell in di&s;grace, and the <HI>Love&s;teiners</HI> carried all be|fore them. So <HI>De Wit</HI> got his &s;on <HI>John,</HI> then but twenty five years of age, to be made pen&s;ioner of <HI>Dort.</HI> And within a year after, the pen&s;ioner of <HI>Holland</HI> dying, he was made pen&s;ioner of <HI>Holland.</HI> His breeding was to the civil law, which he un|der&s;tood very well. He was a great mathematician: And, as his <HI>Elementa Curvarum</HI> &s;hew what a man he was that way, &s;o per|haps no man ever applied <HI>Algebra</HI> to all matters of trade &s;o nice|ly as he did. He made him&s;elf &s;o entirely the ma&s;ter of the &s;tate of <HI>Holland,</HI> that he under&s;tood exactly all the concerns of their revenue, and what &s;ums, and in what manner, could be rai&s;ed upon any emergent of State: For this he had a pocket|book full of tables, and was ever ready to &s;hew how they could be furni&s;hed with money. He was a frank, &s;incere man, with|out fraud, or any other artifice but &s;ilence: To which he had &s;o accu&s;tomed the world, that it was not ea&s;y to know, whether he was &s;ilent on de&s;ign, or cu&s;tom. He had a great clearne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion: And when any thing was propo&s;ed to him, how new &s;oever, he heard all patiently, and then a&s;ked &s;uch que&s;tions as occurred to him: And by the time he had done all this, he was as much ma&s;ter of the propo&s;ition, as the per&s;on was that had made it. He knew nothing of mo|dern hi&s;tory, nor of the &s;tate of Courts: And was eminent|ly defective in all points of form. But he laid down this for a maxim, that all Princes and States followed their own in|tere&s;ts: So, by ob&s;erving what their true intere&s;ts were, he thought, he could without great intelligence calculate what they were about. He did not enough con&s;ider how far pa&s;&s;ions, amours, humours, and opinions wrought on the world; chief|ly on Princes. He had the notions of a Common-wealth from the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI> And from them he came to fancy, that an army commanded by officers of their own country was both more in their own power, and would &s;erve them with the more zeal, &s;ince they them&s;elves had &s;uch an intere&s;t in the &s;ucce&s;s. And &s;o he was again&s;t their hiring foreigners, unle&s;s it was to
<PB N="221" REF="236">
be common &s;oldiers to &s;ave their own people. But he did not enough con&s;ider the phlegm and covetou&s;ne&s;s of his country|men; of which he felt the ill effects afterwards. This was his greate&s;t error, and it turned fatally upon him. But for the ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice at home, and for the management of their trade, and their forces by &s;ea, he was the able&s;t Mini&s;ter they ever had. He had an hereditary hatred to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Orange.</HI> He thought it was impo&s;&s;ible to maintain their liberty, if they were &s;till Statholders. Therefore he did all that was po&s;&s;ible to put an invincible bar in their way, by the perpetual edict. But at the &s;ame time he took great care of pre&s;erving the young Prince's fortune; and looked well to his education, and gave him, as the Prince himfelf told me, very ju&s;t notions of every thing relating to their State. For he &s;aid, he did not know, but that at &s;ome time or other he would be &s;et over them: There|fore he intended to render him fit to govern well.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> became at that time very ungo|vernable. It was thought, that the <HI>We&s;t-India-</HI>Company had been given up chiefly by their means; for it was in value &s;o equal to the <HI>Ea&s;t-India-</HI>Company, that the actions of both were often exchanged for one another. When the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> be|gan his preten&s;ions on the City of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> and on a great part of <HI>We&s;tphalia,</HI> they offered them&s;elves up to the States, if they would pre&s;erve them. But the Town of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> would not con&s;ent to it, nor &s;ubmit to the charge. Yet they never &s;eem|ed to &s;et up for a &s;uperiority over the re&s;t, nor to break the cre|dit of the Court at the <HI>Hague.</HI> Only they were backward in eve|ry thing that was propo&s;ed, that encrea&s;ed the charge. And they were become &s;o weary of <HI>De Wit,</HI> that he felt how much the late mi&s;carriage at &s;ea had &s;haken his credit; &s;ince misfortunes are always imputed to the errors of tho&s;e that govern. So he re|&s;olved to go on board. <HI>De Ruyter</HI> often &s;aid, that he was amazed to &s;ee how &s;oon he came to a perfect under&s;tanding of all the &s;ea affairs. The winds were &s;o long backward, that it was not ea&s;y to get their great &s;hips thro' the <HI>Zuyder</HI> &s;ea. So he went out in boats him&s;elf, and plummed it all &s;o carefully, that he found many more ways to get out by different winds, than was thought formerly practicable. He got out in time to be ma&s;ter of the &s;ea, before the end of the &s;ea&s;on: And &s;o recovered the affront of the former lo&s;&s;es, by keeping at &s;ea after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fleet was forced to put in. The Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> was &s;ent to the North with a great part of the fleet, to lie for the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> &s;hips. But he was thought too remi&s;s. They got, before he was aware of it, into <HI>Berghen</HI> in <HI>Norway.</HI> If he had followed
<PB N="222" REF="237">
them quick, he would have forced the port, and taken them all. But he ob&s;erved forms, and &s;ent to the Viceroy of <HI>Norway</HI> de|manding entrance. That was denied him. But, while the&s;e me&s;&s;ages went backward and forward, the <HI>Dutch</HI> had &s;o fortifyed the entrance into the port, that, tho' it was attempted with great courage, yet <HI>Tiddiman,</HI> and tho&s;e who compo&s;ed that &s;qua|dron, were beat off with great lo&s;s, and forced to let go a very rich fleet: For which Lord <HI>Sandwich</HI> was much blamed, tho' he was &s;ent Amba&s;&s;adour into <HI>Spain,</HI> that his di&s;grace might be a little &s;oftened by that employment. The Duke's conduct was al&s;o much blamed: And it was &s;aid, he was mo&s;t in fault, but that the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> was made the &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>Here I will add a particular relation of a tran&s;action relating <NOTE PLACE="marg">An account of the affairs of <HI>Berghen.</HI></NOTE> to that affair, taken from the account given of it by Sir <HI>Gilbert Talbot,</HI> then the King's Envoy at the Court of <HI>Denmark,</HI> in a MS. that I have in my hands. That King did in <HI>June</HI> 1665 open him&s;elf very freely to <HI>Talbot,</HI> complaining of the States, who, as he &s;aid, had drawn the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> war on him, on de&s;ign that he might be forced to depend on them for &s;upplies of mo|ney and &s;hipping, and &s;o to get the cu&s;toms of <HI>Norway</HI> and the <HI>Sound</HI> into their hands for their &s;ecurity. <HI>Talbot</HI> upon that told him, that the <HI>Dutch Smyrna</HI> fleet was now in <HI>Berghen,</HI> be|&s;ides many rich <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> &s;hips; and that they &s;taid there in ex|pectation of a double <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> fleet, and of <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> who was returning with the &s;poils of the coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea.</HI> So he &s;aid, the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> might &s;eize tho&s;e &s;hips before the convoy came, which they expected. The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> &s;aid, he had not &s;trength to execute that. <HI>Talbot</HI> &s;aid, the King his ma&s;ter would &s;end a force to effect it: But it was rea&s;onable he &s;hould have half of the &s;poil. To which the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> readily agreed, and ordered him to propo&s;e it to his ma&s;ter. So he immediately tran&s;mitted it to the King, who approved of it, and promi&s;ed to &s;end a fleet to put it in execution. The Mi|ni&s;ters of <HI>Denmark</HI> were appointed to concert the matter with <HI>Talbot.</HI> But nothing was put in writing; for the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> was a&s;hamed to treat of &s;uch an affair, otherwi&s;e than by word of mouth. Before the end of <HI>July,</HI> news came, that <HI>De Ruyter</HI> with the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Fleet was on the coa&s;t of <HI>Norway.</HI> Soon after he came into <HI>Berghen.</HI> The riches then in that port were reckoned at many millions.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> was then in tho&s;e &s;eas. So <HI>Talbot</HI> &s;ent a ve&s;&s;el expre&s;s to him with the news. But that ve&s;&s;el fell into the hands of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, and was &s;ent to <HI>Holland.</HI> The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> writ to the Viceroy of <HI>Norway,</HI> and to the Gover|nour
<PB N="223" REF="238">
of <HI>Berghen,</HI> ordering them to u&s;e all fair means to keep the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;till in their harbour, promi&s;ing to &s;end particular in|&s;tructions in a few days to them how to proceed. <HI>Talbot</HI> &s;ent letters with the&s;e, to be delivered &s;ecretly to the Commanders of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> frigats, to let them know that they might boldly a&s;&s;ault the <HI>Dutch</HI> in port; for the <HI>Danes</HI> would make no re&s;i|&s;tance, pretending a fear that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> might de&s;troy their Town: But that an account was to be kept of their prizes, that the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> might have a ju&s;t half of all: They were not to be &s;urprized, if the <HI>Danes</HI> &s;eemed at fir&s;t to talk high: That was to be done for &s;hew: But they would grow calmer, when they came to engage. The Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> &s;ent his Se|cretary to <HI>Talbot,</HI> to know the particulars of the agreement with the King of <HI>Denmark.</HI> But the ve&s;&s;el that brought him was ordered, upon landing the Secretary, to come back to the fleet. So that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;end by that ve&s;&s;el what was de&s;ired. And no other &s;hips could be got to carry back the Secretary. And thus the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> went to attack the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet with|out &s;taying for an an&s;wer from <HI>Talbot,</HI> or knowing what orders the Governour of <HI>Berghen</HI> had yet received: For tho' the orders were &s;ent, yet it was &s;o great a way, ten or twelve days journey, that they could not reach the place, but after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fleet had made the attack. The Viceroy of <HI>Norway,</HI> who re&s;ided at <HI>Chri&s;tiana,</HI> had his orders &s;ooner, and &s;ent out two gallies to communicate the agreement to the Earl of <HI>Sandwich;</HI> but mi&s;&s;ed him, for he was then before <HI>Berghen.</HI> The Governour of <HI>Berghen,</HI> not hav|ing yet the orders that the former expre&s;s promi&s;ed him, &s;ent a Gentleman to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fleet, de&s;iring they would make no attack for two or three days; for by that time he expected his orders. <HI>Clifford</HI> was &s;ent to the Governour, who in&s;i&s;ted that till he had orders he mu&s;t defend the port, but that he expected them in a very little time. Upon <HI>Clifford</HI>'s going back to the fleet, a Council of war was called, in which the officers, animated with the hope of a rich booty, re&s;olved without farther delay to attack the port, either doubting the &s;incerity of the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Court, or unwilling to give them &s;o large a &s;hare of that, on which they reckoned as already their prize. Upon this <HI>Tiddi|man</HI> began the attack, which ended fatally. Diver&s;e frigats were di&s;abled, and many officers and &s;eamen were killed. The &s;qua|dron was thus ruined, and <HI>Tiddiman</HI> was ready to &s;ink: So he was forced to &s;lip his cables, and retire to the fleet, which lay without the rocks. This action was on the third of <HI>Augu&s;t:</HI> And on the fourth the Governour received his orders. So he &s;ent for <HI>Clifford,</HI> and &s;hewed him his orders. But, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
<PB N="224" REF="239">
fleet had by their precipitation forced him to do what he had done, &s;o he could not, upon what had happened the day be|fore, execute tho&s;e orders, till he &s;ent an account of what had pa&s;s'd to the Court of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and had the King's &s;econd or|ders upon it. And, if the whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fleet would not &s;tay in tho&s;e &s;eas &s;o long, he de&s;ired they would leave &s;ix frigats be|fore the harbour; and he would engage, the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hould not in the mean while go out to &s;ea. But the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were &s;ullen upon their di&s;appointment, and &s;ailed away. The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> was un&s;peakably troubled at the lo&s;s of the greate&s;t trea&s;ure he was ever like to have in his hands. This was a de|&s;ign well laid, that would have been as fatal to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as ignominious to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and was by the impati|ent ravenou&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lo&s;t, without po&s;&s;ibility of reco|vering it. And indeed there was not one good &s;tep made after this in the whole progre&s;s of the war.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> was at this time in a di&s;mal &s;tate. The plague con|tinued <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment at <HI>Ox|ford.</HI></NOTE> for the mo&s;t part of the &s;ummer in and about <HI>London,</HI> and began to &s;pread over the country. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> moved the King to go to <HI>Salisbury.</HI> But the Plague broke out there. So the Court went to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where another &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament was held. And tho' the conduct at &s;ea was &s;everely reflected on, yet all that was nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on the war another year was given. The Hou&s;e of Commons kept up the ill humour they were in again&s;t the Non-conformi&s;ts very high. A great many of the Mini&s;ters of <HI>London</HI> were driven away by the Plague; tho' &s;ome few &s;taid. Many Churches being &s;hut up, when the inhabitants were in a more than ordinary di&s;po&s;i|tion to profit by good &s;ermons, &s;ome of the Non-conformi&s;ts up|on that went into the empty pulpits, and preached; and, it was given out, with very good &s;ucce&s;s: And in many other places they began to preach openly, not without reflecting on the &s;ins of the Court, and on the ill u&s;age that they them&s;elves had met with. This was repre&s;ented very odiou&s;ly at <HI>Oxford.</HI> So a &s;evere bill was brought in, requiring all the &s;ilenced Mini&s;ters to take an oath, declaring it was not lawful on any pretence what&s;oever to take arms again&s;t the King, or any commi&s;&s;ioned by him, and that they would not at any time endeavour an alteration in the government of the Church or State. Such as refu&s;ed this were not to come within five miles of any City, or Parliament Borough, or of the Church where they had &s;erved. This was much oppo&s;ed in both Hou&s;es, but more faintly in the Hou&s;e of Commons. The Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> &s;poke vehemently again&s;t it in the Hou&s;e of Lords. He &s;aid, he could take no &s;uch
<PB N="225" REF="240">
oath him&s;elf: For how firm &s;oever he had always been to the Church, yet, as things were managed, he did not know but he him&s;elf might &s;ee cau&s;e to endeavour an alteration. Doctor <HI>Earl,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> died at that time. But, before his death, he declared him&s;elf much again&s;t this Act. He was the man of all the Clergy for whom the King had the greate&s;t e&s;teem. He had been his &s;ubtutor, and had followed him in all his exile with &s;o clear a character, that the King could never &s;ee or hear of any one thing ami&s;s in him. So he, who had a &s;ecret plea|&s;ure in finding out any thing that le&s;&s;ened a man e&s;teemed emi|nent for piety, yet had a value for him beyond all the men of his order. <HI>Sheldon</HI> and <HI>Ward</HI> were the Bi&s;hops that acted and argued mo&s;t for this Act, which came to be called the Five Mile Act. All that were the &s;ecret favourers of Popery promoted it: Their con&s;tant maxim being, to bring all the Sectaries into &s;o de&s;perate a &s;tate, that they &s;hould be at mercy, and forced to de&s;ire a toleration on &s;uch terms, as the King &s;hould think fit to grant it on. <HI>Clifford</HI> began to make a great figure in the Hou&s;e of Commons. He was the &s;on of a Clergy-man, born to a &s;mall fortune: But was a man of great vivacity. He was re|conciled to the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> before the Re&s;toration. The Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> had many &s;pies among the Prie&s;ts: And the news of this was brought him among other things. So, when <HI>Clifford</HI> began fir&s;t to appear in the Hou&s;e, he got one to re|commend him to the Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s favour. The Lord <HI>Cla|rendon</HI> looked into the advice that was brought him: And by com|paring things together, he perceived that he mu&s;t be that man: And upon that he excu&s;ed him&s;elf the be&s;t he could. So <HI>Clifford</HI> &s;truck in with his enemies; and tied him&s;elf particularly to <HI>Ben|net,</HI> made Lord, and afterwards Earl of <HI>Arlington.</HI> While the Act was before the Hou&s;e of Commons, <HI>Vaughan,</HI> afterwards made Chief Ju&s;tice of the Common-pleas, moved that the word <HI>legally</HI> might be added to the word <HI>commi&s;&s;ioned by the King:</HI> But <HI>Finch,</HI> then Attorney General, &s;aid, that was needle&s;s; &s;ince unle&s;s the commi&s;&s;ion was legal it was no commi&s;&s;ion, and, to make it legal, it mu&s;t be i&s;&s;ued out for a lawful occa&s;ion, and to per&s;ons capable of it, and mu&s;t pa&s;s in the due form of law. The other in&s;i&s;ted that the addition would clear all &s;cruples, and procure an univer&s;al compliance. But that could not be obtain|ed; for it was intended to lay difficulties in the way of tho&s;e again&s;t whom the Act was levelled. When the bill came up to the Lords, the Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> moved for the &s;ame ad|dition; but was an&s;wered by the Earl of <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> upon the &s;ame grounds on which <HI>Finch</HI> went. Yet this gave great &s;ati&s;faction
<PB N="226" REF="241">
to many who heard of it, this being the avowed &s;en&s;e of the le|gi&s;lators. The whole matter was &s;o explained by <HI>Bridgman,</HI> when <HI>Bates</HI> with a great many more came into the Court of Common-pleas to take the oath. The Act pa&s;s'd: And the Non|conformi&s;ts were put to great &s;traits. They had no mind to take the oath. And they &s;carce knew how to di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves according to the terms of the Act. Some moderate men took pains to per&s;uade them to take the oath. It was &s;aid by <HI>endea|vour</HI> was only meant an unlawful endeavour; and that it was &s;o declared in the debates in both Hou&s;es. Some Judges did on the bench expound it in that &s;en&s;e. Yet few of them took it. Many more refu&s;ed it, who were put to hard &s;hifts to live, be|ing &s;o far &s;eparated from the places from which they drew their chief &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. Yet as all this &s;everity in a time of war, and of &s;uch a publick calamity, drew very hard cen&s;ures on the pro|moters of it, &s;o it rai&s;ed the compa&s;&s;ions of their party &s;o much, that I have been told they were &s;upplied more plentifully at that time than ever. There was better rea&s;on, than perhaps tho&s;e of <HI>Oxford</HI> knew, to &s;u&s;pect practices again&s;t the State.</P>
<P><HI>Algernoon Sidney,</HI> and &s;ome others of the Common-wealth <NOTE PLACE="marg">The de&s;igns of the Com|mon-wealth party.</NOTE> party, came to <HI>De Wit,</HI> and pre&s;s'd him to think of an inva&s;i|on of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> and gave him great a&s;&s;urances of a &s;trong party: And they were bringing many officers to <HI>Hol|land</HI> to join in the undertaking. They dealt al&s;o with &s;ome in <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> who were particularly &s;harpened again&s;t the King, and were for turning <HI>England</HI> again into a Common-wealth. The matter was for &s;ome time in agitation at the <HI>Hague.</HI> But <HI>De Wit</HI> was again&s;t it, and got it to be laid a&s;ide. He &s;aid, their going into &s;uch a de&s;ign would provoke <HI>France</HI> to turn again&s;t them: It might engage them in a long war, the con&s;e|quences of which could not be fore&s;een: And, as there was no rea&s;on to think, that, while the Parliament was &s;o firm to the King, any di&s;contents could be carried &s;o far as to a general ri|&s;ing, which the&s;e men undertook for; &s;o, he &s;aid, what would the effect be of turning <HI>England</HI> into a Common-wealth, if it could po&s;&s;ibly be brought about, but the ruine of <HI>Holland?</HI> It would naturally draw many of the <HI>Dutch</HI> to leave their country, that could not be kept and maintained but at a va&s;t charge, and to exchange that for the plenty and &s;ecurity that <HI>England</HI> af|forded. Therefore all that he would engage in was, to weak|en the trade of <HI>England,</HI> and to de&s;troy their fleet; in which he &s;ucceeded the following year beyond all expectation. The bu|&s;y men in <HI>Scotland,</HI> being encouraged from <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> went about the country, to try if any men of weight would &s;et them|&s;elves
<PB N="227" REF="242">
at the head of their de&s;igns for an in&s;urrection. The Earl of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ilis</HI> and <HI>Lockhart</HI> were the two per&s;ons they re&s;olved to try. But they did it at &s;o great a di&s;tance, that, from the propo|&s;ition made to them, there was no danger of mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea|&s;on. Lord <HI>Ca&s;&s;ilis</HI> had given his word to the King, that he would never engage in any plots: And he had got under the King's hand a promi&s;e, that he and his family &s;hould not be di|&s;turbed, let him &s;erve God in what way he plea&s;ed. So he did not &s;uffer them to come &s;o far as to make him any propo&s;itions. <HI>Lockhart</HI> did the &s;ame. They &s;eeing no other per&s;on that had credit enough in the countrey to bring the people about him, gave over all the projects for that year. But, upon the infor|mations that the King had of their caballing at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> he rai&s;ed tho&s;e troops of which mention was formerly made.</P>
<P>An accident happened this winter at <HI>Oxford,</HI> too incon&s;ide|rable, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s jea|lou&s;y.</NOTE> and too tender to be mentioned, if it were not that great effects were believed to have followed on it. The Duke had al|ways one private amour after another, in the managing of which he &s;eemed to &s;tand more in awe of the Duche&s;s, than, con&s;idering the inequality of their rank, could have been imagined. <HI>Talbot</HI> was looked on as the chief manager of tho&s;e intrigues. The Duche&s;s's deportment was unexceptionable, which made her au|thority the greater. At <HI>Oxford</HI> there was then a very graceful young man of quality that belonged to her Court, who&s;e &s;ervi|ces were &s;o acceptable, that &s;he was thought to look at him in a particular manner. This was &s;o repre&s;ented to the Duke, that he, being re&s;olved to emancipate him&s;elf into more open prac|tices, took up a jealou&s;y; and put the per&s;on out of his Court with &s;o much precipitation, that the thing became very publick by this means. The Duche&s;s lo&s;t the power &s;he had over him &s;o entirely, that no method &s;he could think on was like to re|cover it, except one. She began to di&s;cover what his religion was, tho' he &s;till came not only to Church, but to Sacrament. And upon that &s;he, to regain what &s;he had lo&s;t, entered into private di&s;cour&s;es with his Prie&s;ts; but in &s;o &s;ecret a manner, that there was not for &s;ome years after this the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion given. She began by degrees to &s;lacken in her con&s;tant coming to Prayers and to Sacrament, in which &s;he had been before that regular, almo&s;t to &s;uper&s;tition. She put that on her ill health: For &s;he fell into an ill habit of body, which &s;ome imputed to the effect of &s;ome of the Duke's di&s;tempers communicated to her. A &s;tory was &s;et about, and generally believed, that the Earl of <HI>Southe&s;k,</HI> that had married a daughter of Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s, &s;u&s;|pecting &s;ome familiarities between the Duke and his wife, <NOTE PLACE="marg">His amours.</NOTE>
<PB N="228" REF="243">
had taken a &s;ure method to procure a di&s;ea&s;e to him&s;elf, which he communicated to his wife, and was by that means &s;et round till it came to the Duche&s;s, who was &s;o tainted with it that it was the occa&s;ion of the death of all her children, except the two daughters, our two Queens; and was believed the cau&s;e of an illne&s;s under which &s;he langui&s;hed long, and died &s;o cor|rupted, that in dre&s;&s;ing her body after her death, one of her brea&s;ts bur&s;t, being a ma&s;s of corruption. Lord <HI>Southe&s;k</HI> was for &s;ome years not ill plea&s;ed to have this believed. It looked like a peculiar &s;train of revenge, with which he &s;eemed much delighted. But I know he has to &s;ome of his friends denied the whole of the &s;tory very &s;olemnly. Another acted a better part. He did not like a commerce that he ob&s;erved between the Duke and his wife. He went and expo&s;tulated with him upon it. The Duke $ell a commending his wife much. He told him, he came not to &s;eek his wife's character from him: The mo&s;t ef|fectual way of commending her, was to have nothing to do with her. He added, that if Princes would do tho&s;e wrongs to &s;ub|jects, who could not demand &s;uch reparations of honour as they could from their equals, it would put them on &s;ecreter methods of revenge: For &s;ome injuries were &s;uch, that men of honour could not bear them. And, upon a new ob&s;ervation he made of the Duke's de&s;igns upon his wife, he quitted a very good po&s;t, and went with her into the country, where he kept her till &s;he di|ed. Upon the whole matter the Duke was often ill. The children were born with ulcers, or they broke out upon them &s;oon after: And all his &s;ons died young, and unhealthy. This has, as far as any thing that could not be brought in the way of proof, prevailed to create a &s;u&s;picion, that &s;o healthy a child as the pretended Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> could neither be his, nor be born of any wife with whom he had lived long. The violent pain that his elde&s;t daughter had in her eyes, and the gout which has early &s;eized our pre&s;ent Queen, are thought the dregs of a tainted original. <HI>Willis,</HI> the great phy&s;ician, being called to con&s;ult for one of his &s;ons, gave his opinion in tho&s;e words, <HI>Mala Stamina $itae;</HI> which gave &s;uch offence, that he was never called for afterwards.</P>
<P>I know nothing of the coun&s;els of the year 1666, nor who&s;e advices prevailed. It was re&s;olved on, that the Duke &s;hould not go to &s;ea; but that <HI>Monk</HI> &s;hould command the great fleet of be|tween fifty and &s;ixty &s;hips of the line, and that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> &s;hould be &s;ent with a &s;quadron of about twenty five &s;hips to meet the <HI>French</HI> fleet, and to hinder their conjunction with the <HI>Dutch:</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="244">
For the <HI>French</HI> had promi&s;ed a fleet to join the <HI>Dutch,</HI> but never &s;ent it. <HI>Monk</HI> went out &s;o certain of victory, that he &s;eemed only concerned for fear the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hould not come out. The Court flattered them&s;elves with the hopes of a very happy year: But it proved a fatal one. The <HI>Dutch</HI> fleet came out, <HI>De Wit</HI> and &s;ome of the States being on board. They engaged the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fleet for <NOTE PLACE="marg">The fleet was almo&s;t quite lo&s;t and happily &s;aved by Prince <HI>Ru|pert.</HI></NOTE> two days, in which they had a manife&s;t &s;uperiority. But it co&s;t them dear; for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fought well. But the <HI>Dutch</HI> were &s;uperiour in number, and were &s;o well furni&s;hed with chained &s;hot, (a pe|culiar contrivance of which <HI>De Wit</HI> had the honour to be thought the inventer, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fleet was quite unrigged.) And they were in no condition to work them&s;elves off. So they mu&s;t have all been taken, &s;unk, or burnt, if Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> being yet in the channel, and hearing that they were engaged by the continued roaring of guns, had not made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to get to them. He came in good time. And the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who had &s;uffered much, &s;eeing &s;o great a force come up, &s;teered off. He was in no con|dition to pur&s;ue them; but brought off our fleet, which &s;aved us a great lo&s;s that &s;eemed otherwi&s;e unavoidable. The Court gave out that it was a victory: And publick thank&s;givings were ordered, which was a horrid mocking of God, and a lying to the world. We had in one re&s;pect rea&s;on to thank God, that we had not lo&s;t our whole fleet. But to compleat the mi&s;eries of this year: The Plague was &s;o &s;unk in <HI>London,</HI> that the inhabi|tants began to return to it, and brought with them a great deal of manufacture, which was lying on the hands of the clothiers and others, now in the &s;econd year of the war, in which trade and all other con&s;umptions were very low. It was reckoned, that a peace mu&s;t come next winter. The merchants were upon that preparing to go to market as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. The &s;ummer had been the drye&s;t that was known of &s;ome years. And <HI>Lon|don</HI> being for the mo&s;t part built of timber filled up with plai&s;ter, all was extream dry. On the &s;econd of <HI>September</HI> a fire broke <NOTE PLACE="marg">The fire of <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> out, that raged for three days, as if it had a commi&s;&s;ion to de|vour every thing that was in its way. On the fourth day it &s;topt in the mid&s;t of very combu&s;tible matter.</P>
<P>I will not enlarge on the extent nor the de&s;truction made by the fire: Many books are full of it. That which is &s;till a great &s;ecret is, whether it was ca&s;ual, or rai&s;ed on de&s;ign. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fleet had landed on the <HI>Vly,</HI> an i&s;land lying near the <HI>Texel,</HI> and had burnt it: Upon which &s;ome came to <HI>De Wit,</HI> and offered a revenge, that, if they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted, they would &s;et <HI>London</HI> on fire. He rejected the propo&s;ition: For he &s;aid, he would not make the breach wider, nor the quarrel irreconcilable. He &s;aid,
<PB N="230" REF="245">
it was brought him by one of the <HI>Labadi&s;ts,</HI> as &s;ent to them by &s;ome others. He made no farther reflections on the matter till the City was burnt. Then he began to &s;u&s;pect there had been a de&s;ign, and that they had intended to draw him into it, and to lay the odium of it upon the <HI>Dutch.</HI> But he could hear no news of tho&s;e who had &s;ent that propo&s;ition to him. In the <HI>April</HI> before, &s;ome Common-wealths-men were found in a plot, and hanged; who at their execution confe&s;&s;ed, they had been &s;poken to, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in a de&s;ign of burning <HI>London</HI> on the &s;econd of <HI>September.</HI> This was printed in the gazette of that week, which I my &s;elf read. Now the fire breaking out on the &s;econd made all people conclude, that there was a de&s;ign &s;ome time before on foot for doing it.</P>
<P>The Papi&s;ts were generally charged with it. One <HI>Hubert,</HI> a <NOTE PLACE="marg">It was charged on the Papi&s;ts.</NOTE> <HI>French</HI> Papi&s;t, was &s;eized on in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> as he was getting out of the way in great confu&s;ion. He confe&s;&s;ed, he had begun the fire, and per&s;i&s;ted in his confe&s;&s;ion to his death; for he was hanged upon no other evidence but that of his own confe&s;&s;ion. It is true, he gave &s;o broken an account of the whole matter, that he was thought mad. Yet he was blindfolded, and carried to &s;everal places of the City: And then, his eyes being opened, he was a&s;ked, if that was the place: And he being carried to wrong places, after he looked round about for &s;ome time, he &s;aid, that was not the place: But when he was brought to the place where it fir&s;t broke out, he affirmed that was the true place. And <HI>Til|lot&s;on</HI> told me, that <HI>Howell,</HI> then the recorder of <HI>London,</HI> was with him, and had much di&s;cour&s;e with him; and that he concluded, it was impo&s;&s;ible that it could be a melancholy dream: The hor|rour of the fact, and the terrour of death, and perhaps &s;ome engagements in confe&s;&s;ion, might put him in &s;uch di&s;order, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to draw a clear account of any thing from him, but of what related to him&s;elf. <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> who believed that the City was burnt on de&s;ign, told me a circum&s;tance that made the Papi&s;ts employing &s;uch a crazed man in &s;uch a &s;ervice more credible. <HI>Langhorn,</HI> the Popi&s;h coun&s;ellor at law, who for many years pa&s;s'd for a Prote&s;tant, was di&s;patching a half-witted man to manage elections in <HI>Kent</HI> before the Re&s;toration. <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> being pre&s;ent, and ob&s;erving what a &s;ort of man he was, a&s;ked <HI>Langhorn,</HI> how he could employ him in &s;uch &s;ervices. <HI>Lang|horn</HI> an&s;wered, it was a maxim with him in dangerous &s;ervices to employ none but half-witted men, if they could be but &s;ecret and obey orders: For if they &s;hould change their minds, and turn inform rs in&s;tead of agents, it would be ea&s;y to di&s;credit them, and to carry off the weight of any di&s;coveries they could make,
<PB N="231" REF="246">
by &s;hewing they were mad-men, and &s;o not like to be tru&s;ted in critical things.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t extraordinary pa&s;&s;age, tho' it is but a pre&s;umption, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;trong pre&s;umption of it.</NOTE> was told me by Doctor <HI>Lloyd</HI> and the Counte&s;s of <HI>Clarendon.</HI> The latter had a great e&s;tate in the new river that is brought from <HI>Ware</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> which is brought together at <HI>I&s;lington,</HI> where there is a great room full of pipes that convey it thro' all the &s;treets of <HI>London.</HI> The con&s;tant order of that matter was, to &s;et all the pipes a running on <HI>Saturday</HI> night, that &s;o the ci&s;terns might be all full by <HI>Sunday</HI> morning, there being a more than ordinary con&s;umption of water on that day. There was one <HI>Grant,</HI> a Papi&s;t, under who&s;e name Sir <HI>William Petty</HI> pub|li&s;hed his ob&s;ervations on the bills of mortality: He had &s;ome time before applied him&s;elf to <HI>Lloyd,</HI> who had great credit with the Counte&s;s of <HI>Clarendon;</HI> and &s;aid, he could rai&s;e that e&s;tate con&s;iderably, if &s;he would make him a tru&s;tee for her. His &s;chemes were probable: And he was made one of the board that governed that matter: And by that he had a right to come, as oft as he plea&s;ed, to view their works at <HI>I&s;lington.</HI> He went thither the <HI>Saturday</HI> before the fire broke out, and called for the key of the place where the heads of the pipes were, and turn|ed all the cocks that were then open, and &s;topt the water, and went away, and carried the keys with him. So when the fire broke out next morning, they opened the pipes in the &s;treets to find water, but there was none. And &s;ome hours were lo&s;t in &s;ending to <HI>I&s;lington,</HI> where the door was to be broke open, and the cocks turned. And it was long before the water got to <HI>Lon|don. Grant</HI> indeed denied that he had turned the cocks. But the officer of the works affirmed, that he had, according to or|der, &s;et them all a running, and that no per&s;on had got the keys from him, be&s;ides <HI>Grant;</HI> who confe&s;&s;ed he had carried away the keys, but pretended he did it without de&s;ign. There were many other &s;tories &s;et about, as that the Papi&s;ts in &s;everal places had a&s;ked, if there was no news of the burning of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> and that it was talked of in many parts beyond &s;ea, long before the news could get thither from <HI>London.</HI> In this matter I was much determined by what Sir <HI>Thomas Littleton,</HI> the father, told me. He was a man of a &s;trong head, and &s;ound judgment. He had ju&s;t as much knowledge in trade, hi&s;tory, the di&s;po&s;iti|on of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the con&s;titution of <HI>England,</HI> as &s;erved to feed and direct his own thoughts, and no more. He lived all the &s;ummer long in <HI>London,</HI> where I was his next neighbour, and had for &s;even years a con&s;tant and daily conver&s;ation with him. He was Trea&s;urer of the Navy in conjunction with <HI>Osborn,</HI> who
<PB N="232" REF="247">
was afterwards Lord Trea&s;urer, who &s;upplanted him in that po&s;t, and got it all into his own hands. He had a very bad opinion of the King; and thought, that he had wor&s;e intentions than his brother, but that he had a more dextrous way of covering and ma|naging them; only his lazine&s;s made him le&s;s earne&s;t in pro&s;ecuting them. He had generally the character of the able&s;t Parliament man in his time. His chief e&s;tate lay in the City, not far from the place where the fire broke out, tho' it did not turn that way. He was one of the Committee of the Hou&s;e of Commons, that examined all the pre&s;umptions of the City's being burnt on de|&s;ign: And he often a&s;&s;ured me, that there was no clear pre&s;ump|tion made out about it, and that many &s;tories, which were pub|li&s;hed with good a&s;&s;urance, came to nothing upon a &s;trict exami|nation. He was at that time, that the inquiry was made, in em|ployment at Court. So, whether that bia&s;&s;ed him, or not, I can|not tell. There was &s;o great a diver&s;ity of opinions in the mat|ter, that I mu&s;t leave it under the &s;ame uncertainty in which I found it. If the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> had been at that time de|&s;igning an impre&s;&s;ion el&s;ewhere, it might have been more rea|&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e it was done on de&s;ign to di&s;tract our affairs. But it fell out at a dead time, when no advantage could be made of it. And it did not &s;eem probable, that the Papi&s;ts had engag|ed in the de&s;ign, merely to impoveri&s;h and ruine the Nation; for they had nothing ready then to graft upon the confu&s;ion that this put all the people in. Above twelve thou&s;and hou&s;es were burnt down, with the greate&s;t part of the furniture and merchandize that was in them. All means u&s;ed to &s;top it proved ineffectual; tho' the blowing up of hou&s;es was the mo&s;t effectual of any. But the wind was &s;o high, that fleaks of fire and burning matter were carried in the air cro&s;s &s;everal &s;treets. So that the fire &s;pread not only in the next neighbourhood, but at a great di&s;tance. The King and the Duke were almo&s;t all the day long on hor&s;eback with the guards, &s;eeing to all that could be done, either for quenching the fire, or for carrying off per&s;ons and goods to the fields all about <HI>London.</HI> The mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing circum&s;tance of that dreadful conflagration was, that, notwith&s;tanding the great de&s;truction that was made, and the great confu&s;ion in the &s;treets, I could never hear of any one per&s;on that was either burnt, or trodden to death. The King was never ob&s;erved to be &s;o much &s;truck with any thing in his whole life, as with this. But the citizens were not &s;o well &s;atisfied with the Duke's behaviour. They thought he looked too gay, and too little concerned. A jealou&s;y of his being concerned in it was &s;pread about with great
<PB N="233" REF="248">
indu&s;try, but with very little appearance of truth. Yet it grew to be generally believed, chiefly after he owned he was a Papi&s;t.</P>
<P>In <HI>Scotland</HI> the fermentation went very high. <HI>Turner</HI> was &s;ent <NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;orders in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> again into the We&s;t in <HI>October</HI> this year: And he began to treat the country at the old rate. The people were alarmed, and &s;aw they were to be undone. They met together, and talked with &s;ome fiery Mini&s;ters. <HI>Semple, Maxwell, Wel&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Guthry</HI> were the chief incendiaries. Two Gentlemen that had &s;erved in the wars, one a Lieutenant Colonel, <HI>Wallace,</HI> and the other that had been a Ma$or, <HI>Learmoth,</HI> were the be&s;t officers they had to rely on. The chief Gentlemen of tho&s;e Counties were all clapt up in pri&s;on, as was formerly told. So that pre&s;erved them: Otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t either have engaged with the people, or have lo&s;t their intere&s;t among them. The people were told, that the fire of <HI>London</HI> had put things in that confu&s;ion at Court, that any vigorous attempt would di&s;order all the King's affairs. If the new levied troops had not &s;tood in their way, they would have been able to have carried all things again&s;t them: For the two troops of guards with the regiment of foot guards would not have been able to have kept their ground before them. The people, as &s;ome of them told me afterwards, were made to believe that the whole Nation was in the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition. So on the thirteenth of <HI>November</HI> they ran together: And two hundred of them went to <HI>Dunfreis,</HI> where <HI>Turner</HI> then lay with a few &s;oldi|ers about him; the greate&s;t part of his men being then out in parties for the levying of fines. So they &s;urpri&s;ed him before he could get to his arms: Otherwi&s;e, he told me, he would have been killed rather than taken, &s;ince he expected no mercy from them. With him&s;elf they &s;eized his papers and in&s;tructions, by which it appeared he had been gentler than his orders were. So they re&s;olved to keep him, and exchange him as occa&s;ion &s;hould be offered. But they did not tell him what they intended to do with him: So he thought, they were keeping him, till they might hang him up with the more &s;olemnity. There was a con&s;idera|ble ca&s;h in his hands, partly for the pay of his men, partly of the fines which he had rai&s;ed in the country, that was &s;eized: But he, to whom they tru&s;ted the keeping of it, ran away with it. They &s;pread a report, which they have &s;ince printed, and it pa&s;&s;ed for &s;ome time current, that this ri&s;ing was the effect of a &s;udden heat, that the country was put in by &s;eeing one of their neighbours tied on a hor&s;e hand and foot, and carried away, only becau&s;e he could not pay a high fine that was &s;et upon him; and that upon this provocation the neighbours, who did not know how &s;oon &s;uch u&s;age would fall to their own turn, ran to|gether,
<PB N="234" REF="249">
and re&s;cued him; and that, fearing &s;ome &s;evere u&s;age for that, they kept together, and that, others coming into them, they went on, and &s;eized <HI>Turner.</HI> But this was a &s;tory made only to beget compa&s;&s;ion: For, after the in&s;urrection was qua&s;h'd, the Privy Council &s;ent &s;ome round the country, to examine the violences that had been committed, particularly in the pari&s;h where it was given out that this was done. I read the report they made to the Council, and all the depo&s;itions that the peo|ple of the country made before them: But this was not menti|oned in any one of them.</P>
<P>The news of this ri&s;ing was brought to <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> fame en|crea&s;ing <NOTE PLACE="marg">A rebellion in the We&s;t.</NOTE> their numbers to &s;ome thou&s;ands. And this happening to be near <HI>Carlile,</HI> the Governour of that place &s;ent an expre&s;s to Court, in which the &s;trength of the party was magnified much beyond the truth. The Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI> was then at Court, who had a&s;&s;ured the King, that all things were &s;o well managed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that they were in perfect quiet. There were, he &s;aid, &s;ome &s;tubborn Fanaticks &s;till left, that would be &s;oon &s;ubdued: But there was no danger from any thing that they or their party could do. He gave no credit to the expre&s;s from <HI>Carlile:</HI> But, two days after, the news was confirmed by an expre&s;s from <HI>Scotland. Sharp</HI> was then at the head of the government: So he managed this little war, and gave all the orders and directions in it. <HI>Dalziel</HI> was commanded to draw all the force they had together, which lay then di&s;per&s;ed in quarters. When that was done, he marched We&s;tward. A great many ran to the rebels, who came to be called Whiggs. At <HI>Lanerick</HI> in <HI>Cliddi&s;dale</HI> they had a &s;o|lemn fa&s;t day, in which after much praying they renewed the Covenant, and &s;et out their manife&s;to: In which they denied, that they ro&s;e again&s;t the King; they complained of the oppre&s;|&s;ion under which they had groaned; they de&s;ired that Epi&s;copa|cy might be put down, and that Pre&s;bytery, and the Cove|nant, might be &s;et up, and their Mini&s;ters re&s;tored again to them; and then they promi&s;ed, that they would be in all other things the King's mo&s;t obedient &s;ubjects. The Earl of <HI>Argile</HI> rai&s;ed $span$een hundred men, and wrote to the Council that he was ready to march upon order. <HI>Sharp</HI> thought, that if he came into the country, either he or his men would certainly join $word$ $word$ $word$: So he &s;ent him no order at all. But he was at $word$ $word$ $span$ing his men together to no purpo&s;e. <HI>Sharp</HI> was all $word$ $word$ in a dreadful con&s;ternation, and wrote di&s;mal $word$ $word$ $word$, praying that the forces which lay in the North of <HI>$word$</HI> $word$ be ordered down: For, he wrote, they were &s;urrounded with the rebels, and did not know what was become
<PB N="235" REF="250">
of the King's forces. He al&s;o moved, that the Council would go, and &s;hut them&s;elves up in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edenburgh.</HI> But that was oppo&s;ed by the re&s;t of the board, as an abandoning of the Town, and the betraying an unbecoming fear, which might very much encourage the rebels, and &s;uch as intended to go over to them. Orders were given out for rai&s;ing the country: But there was no militia yet formed. In the mean while <HI>Dalzi|el</HI> followed the rebels as clo&s;e as he could. He publi&s;hed a pro|clamation of pardon, as he was ordered, to all that &s;hould in twenty four hours time return to their hou&s;es, and declared all that continued any longer in arms rebels. He found the coun|try was &s;o well affected towards them, that he could get no &s;ort of intelligence, but what his own parties brought in to him. The Whiggs marched towards <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> and came within two miles of the Town. But, finding neither Town nor Country de|clare for them, and that all the hopes their leaders had given them proved fal&s;e, they lo&s;t heart. From being once above two thou&s;and they were now come to be not above eight or nine hun|dred. So they re&s;olved to return back to the We&s;t, where they knew the people were of their &s;ide; and where they could more ea&s;ily di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves, and get either into <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland.</HI> The Mini&s;ters were very bu&s;y in all tho&s;e Counties, plying peo|ple of rank not to for&s;ake their brethren in this extremity. And they had got a company of about three or four&s;core Gentlemen together, who were marching towards them, when they heard of their defeat: And upon that they di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves. The <NOTE PLACE="marg">The defeat given the re|bels at <HI>Pent|land</HI> Hill.</NOTE> rebels thought to have marched back by the way of <HI>Pentland</HI> Hill. They were not much concerned for the few hor&s;es they had. And they knew that <HI>Dalziel,</HI> who&s;e hor&s;e was fatigued with a fortnight's con&s;tant march, could not follow them. And if they had gained but one night more in their march, they had got out of his reach. But on the twenty eighth of <HI>November,</HI> about an hour before &s;un &s;et, he came up to them. They were po&s;ted on the top of a hill: So he engaged with a great di&s;ad|vantage. They, finding they could not get off, &s;topt their march. Their Mini&s;ters did all they could by preaching and praying to infu&s;e courage into them: And they &s;ung the &s;eventy fourth and the &s;eventy eighth P&s;alms. And &s;o they turned on the King's forces. They received the fir&s;t charge that was given by the troop of guards very re&s;olutely, and put them in di&s;order. But that was all the action; for immediately they lo&s;t all order, and ran for their lives. It was now dark: About forty were killed on the &s;pot, and a hundred and thirty were taken. The re&s;t were favoured by the darkne&s;s of the night, and the wearine&s;s of the
<PB N="236" REF="251">
King's troops, that were not in ca&s;e to pur&s;ue them, and had no great heart to it: For they were a poor harmle&s;s company of men, become mad by oppre&s;&s;ion: And they had taken no|thing during all the time they had been together, but what had been freely given them by the country people. The rebellion was broken with the lo&s;s of only five on the King's &s;ide. The Gene|ral came next day into <HI>Edenburgh</HI> with his pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The two Archbi&s;hops were now delivered out of all their fears: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Severe pro|ceedings a|gain&s;t the pri&s;oners.</NOTE> And the common ob&s;ervation, that cruelty and cowardi&s;e go to|gether, was too vi&s;ibly verified on this occa&s;ion. Lord <HI>Rothes</HI> came down full of rage: And, that being inflamed by the two Archbi&s;hops, he re&s;olved to proceed with the utmo&s;t &s;everity again&s;t the pri&s;oners. <HI>Burnet</HI> advi&s;ed the hanging of all tho&s;e who would not renounce the Covenant, and promi&s;e to conform to the laws for the future: But that was thought too &s;evere. Yet he was &s;ent up to <HI>London,</HI> to procure of the King an in&s;tructi|on, that they &s;hould tender the Declaration renouncing the Co|venant to all who were thought di&s;affected; and proceed again&s;t tho&s;e who refu&s;ed that, as again&s;t &s;editious per&s;ons. The be&s;t of the Epi&s;copal Clergy &s;et upon the Bi&s;hops, to lay hold on this opportunity for regaining the affections of the country, by becoming interce&s;&s;ours for the pri&s;oners, and for the country, that was like to be quartered on and eat up for the favour they had expre&s;&s;ed to them. Many of the Bi&s;hops went into this, and particularly <HI>Wi&s;hart</HI> of <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> tho' a rough man, and &s;harpened by ill u&s;age. Yet upon this occa&s;ion he expre&s;&s;ed a ve|ry Chri&s;tian temper, &s;uch as became one who had felt what the rigours of a pri&s;on had been; for he &s;ent every day very liberal &s;upplies to the pri&s;oners: Which was indeed done by the whole Town, in &s;o bountiful a manner, that many of them, who be|ing &s;hut up had neither air nor exerci&s;e, were in greater danger by their plenty, than they had been by all their unhappy cam|paign. But <HI>Sharp</HI> could not be mollified. On the contrary he encouraged the Mini&s;ters in the di&s;affected Counties to bring in all the informations they could gather, both again&s;t the pri&s;o|ners, and again&s;t all tho&s;e who had been among them, that they might be &s;ought for, and proceeded again&s;t. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e got over to <HI>Ireland.</HI> But the Mini&s;ters in tho&s;e parts acted &s;o ill a part, &s;o unbecoming their characters, that the aver&s;ion of the country to them was increa&s;ed to all po&s;&s;ible degrees: They looked on them now as wolves, and not as &s;hepherds. It was a moving &s;ight, to &s;ee ten of the pri&s;oners hanged upon one gibbet at <HI>Edenburgh:</HI> Thirty five more were &s;ent to their coun|tries, and hanged up before their own doors; their Mini&s;ters all
<PB N="237" REF="252">
the while u&s;ing them hardly, and declaring them damned for their rebellion. They might all have &s;aved their lives, if they would have renounced the Covenant: So they were really a &s;ort of martyrs for it. They did all at their death give their te&s;ti|mony, according to their phra&s;e, to the Covenant, and to all that had been done pur&s;uant to it: And they expre&s;&s;ed great joy in their &s;ufferings. Mo&s;t of them were but mean and incon&s;ide|rable men in all re&s;pects: Yet even the&s;e were firm and inflexi|ble in their per&s;ua&s;ions. Many of them e&s;caped, notwith&s;tand|ing the great &s;earch was made for them. <HI>Guthry</HI> the chief of their preachers was hid in my mother's hou&s;e, who was bred to her brother <HI>Wari&s;ton</HI>'s principles, and could never be moved from them: He died next &s;pring. One <HI>Maccail,</HI> that was on|ly a probationer preacher, and who had been chaplain in Sir <HI>James Steward</HI>'s hou&s;e, had gone from <HI>Edenburgh</HI> to them. It was believed, he was &s;ent by the party in town, and that he knew their corre&s;pondents. So he was put to the torture, which in <HI>Scotland</HI> they call the boots; for they put a pair of iron boots clo&s;e on the leg, and drive wedges between the&s;e and the leg. The common torture was only to drive the&s;e in the calf of the leg: But I have been told they were &s;ometimes driven upon the &s;hin bone. He bore the torture with great con&s;tancy: And ei|ther he could &s;ay nothing, or he had the firmne&s;s not to di&s;co|ver tho&s;e who had tru&s;ted him. Every man of them could have &s;aved his own life, if he would accu&s;e any other: But they were all true to their friends. <HI>Maccail,</HI> for all the pains of the torture, died in a rapture of joy: His la&s;t words were, farewel &s;un, moon and &s;tars, farewel kindred and friends, farewel world and time, farewel weak and frail body, welcome eternity, wel|come Angels and Saints, welcome Saviour of the world, and welcome God the Judge of all; which he &s;poke with a voice and manner that &s;truck all that heard it.</P>
<P>His death was the more cried out on, becau&s;e it came to be <NOTE PLACE="marg">1667. The King is more gentle than the Bi+&s;hops.</NOTE> known afterwards, that <HI>Burnet,</HI> who had come down before his execution, had brought with him a letter from the King, in which he approved of all that they had done; but added, that he thought there was blood enough &s;hed, and therefore he or|dered that &s;uch of the pri&s;oners as &s;hould promi&s;e to obey the laws for the future &s;hould be &s;et at liberty, and that the incorri|gible &s;hould be &s;ent to Plantations. <HI>Burnet</HI> let the execution go on, before he produced his letter, pretending there was no Council-day between. But he, who knew the contents of it, ought to have moved the Lord <HI>Rothes</HI> to call an extraordinary
<PB N="238" REF="253">
Council to prevent the execution. So that blood was laid on him. He was, contrary to his natural temper, very violent at that time, much inflamed by his family, and by all about him. Thus this rebellion, that might have been &s;o turned in the conclu&s;ion of it, that the Clergy might have gained reputation and honour by a wi&s;e and merciful conduct, did now exa&s;perate the country more than ever again&s;t the Church. The forces were ordered to lye in the We&s;t, where <HI>Dalziel</HI> acted the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> too gro&s;s|ly. He threatened to &s;pit men, and to roa&s;t them: And he killed &s;ome in cold blood, or rather in hot blood; for he was then drunk, when he ordered one to be hanged, becau&s;e he would not tell where his father was, for whom he was in &s;earch. When he heard of any that did not go to Church, he did not trouble him&s;elf to &s;et a fine upon him: But he &s;et as many &s;oldiers up|on him, as &s;hould eat him up in a night. By this means all people were &s;truck with &s;uch a terrour, that they came regular|ly to Church. And the Clergy were &s;o delighted with it, that they u&s;ed to &s;peak of that time, as the poets do of the golden age. They never interceded for any compa&s;&s;ion to their peo|ple; nor did they take care to live more regularly, or to labour more carefully. They looked on the &s;oldiery as their patrons: They were ever in their company, complying with them in their exce&s;&s;es: And, if they were not much wronged, they rather led them into them, than check'd them for them. <HI>Dalziel</HI> him&s;elf and his officers were &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted with them, that they encrea&s;ed the complaints, that had now more credit from them, than from tho&s;e of the country, who were looked on as their enemies. Things of &s;o &s;trange a pitch in vice were told of them, that they &s;eemed &s;carce credible. The per&s;on, whom I believed the be&s;t as to all &s;uch things, was one Sir <HI>John Cunningham,</HI> an eminent lawyer, who had an e&s;tate in the country, and was the mo&s;t ex|traordinary man of his profe&s;&s;ion in that Kingdom. He was Epi&s;copal beyond mo&s;t men in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who for the far great|e&s;t part thought that forms of government were in their own nature indifferent, and might be either good or bad according to the hands in which they fell; whereas he thought Epi&s;copa|cy was of a divine right, &s;ettled by <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> He was not only ve|ry learned in the civil and canon law, and in the philo&s;ophical learning, but was very univer&s;al in all other learning: He was a great divine, and well read in the Fathers, and in eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory. He was above all, a man of eminent probity, and of a &s;weet temper, and indeed one of the piou&s;e&s;t men of the Na|tion. The &s;tate of the Church in tho&s;e parts went to his heart: For it was not ea&s;y to know how to keep an even hand between
<PB N="239" REF="254">
the perver&s;ene&s;s of the people on the one &s;ide, and the vices of the Clergy on the other. They looked on all tho&s;e that were &s;en&s;ible of their mi&s;carriages, as enemies of the Church. It was after all hard to believe all that was &s;et about again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The King's affairs in <HI>England</HI> forced him to &s;often his govern|ment <NOTE PLACE="marg">A change of coun&s;el and more mo|deration in the Govern|ment.</NOTE> every where. So at this time the Earls of <HI>Tweedale</HI> and <HI>Kin|cardin</HI> went to Court, and laid before the King the ill &s;tate the country was in. Sir <HI>Robert Murray</HI> talked often with him about it. Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was more cautious by rea&s;on of the jealou&s;y of his being a Pre&s;byterian. Upon all which the King re&s;olved to put <HI>Scotland</HI> into other hands. A Convention of E&s;tates had been called the year before, to rai&s;e money for maintaining the troops. This was a very ancient practice in the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> con|&s;titution: A Convention was &s;ummoned to meet within twenty days: They could only levy money, and petition for the redre&s;s of grievances; but could make no new laws; and meddled only with that for which they were brought together. In the former Convention <HI>Sharp</HI> had pre&s;ided, being named by the Earl of <HI>Ro|thes</HI> as the King's Commi&s;&s;ioner. In the winter 1666, or rather in the &s;pring 1667, there was another Convention called, in which the King by a &s;pecial letter appointed Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> to pre&s;ide. And the King in a letter to Lord <HI>Rothes</HI> ordered him to write to <HI>Sharp</HI> to &s;tay within his dioce&s;s, and to come no more to <HI>Eden|burgh.</HI> He upon this was &s;truck with &s;o deep a melancholy, that he &s;hewed as great an abjectne&s;s under this &s;light di&s;grace, as he had &s;hewed in&s;olence before, when he had more favour. The Convention continued the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment for another year at 6000 pounds a month. <HI>Sharp,</HI> finding he was now under a cloud, &s;tu+died to make him&s;elf popular by looking after the education of the Marquis of <HI>Huntley,</HI> now the Duke of <HI>Gordon.</HI> He had an order long before from the King to look to his education, that he might be bred a Prote&s;tant; for the &s;trength of Popery within that Kingdom lay in his family. But, tho' this was ordered du|ring the Earl of <HI>Middletoun</HI>'s mini&s;try, <HI>Sharp</HI> had not all this while looked after it. The Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI>'s mi&s;tri&s;s was a Papi&s;t, and nearly related to the Marquis of <HI>Huntly.</HI> So <HI>Sharp,</HI> either to make his court the better, or at the Lord <HI>Rothes</HI>'s de&s;ire, had neglected it the&s;e four years: But now he called for him. He was then above 15, well hardened in his prejudices by the lo&s;s of &s;o much time. What pains was taken on him, I know not. But, after a trial of &s;ome months, <HI>Sharp</HI> &s;aid, he &s;aw he was not to be wrought on, and &s;ent him back to his mother. So the intere&s;t that popery had in <HI>Scotland</HI> was believed to be chiefly ow|ing to <HI>Sharp</HI>'s compliance with the Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI>'s amours. The
<PB N="240" REF="255">
neglect of his duty in &s;o important a matter was much blamed: But the doing it upon &s;uch a motive was reckoned yet more in|famous. After the convention was over, Lord <HI>Rothes</HI> &s;ent up <HI>Drumond</HI> to repre&s;ent to the King the ill affections of the we&s;tern parts. And, to touch the King in a &s;en&s;ible point, he &s;aid, the Covenant &s;tuck &s;o deep in their hearts, that no good could be done till that was rooted out. So he propo&s;ed, as an expedient, that the King would give the Council a power to require all whom they &s;u&s;pected to renounce the Covenant, and to proceed again&s;t &s;uch as refu&s;ed it as traitors. <HI>Drumond</HI> had yet too much of the air of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> about him, tho' not with <HI>Dalziel</HI>'s fiercene&s;s: He had a great mea&s;ure of knowledge and learning, and &s;ome true impre&s;&s;ions of religion: But he thought, that upon &s;uch powers granted there would be great dealing in bribes and confi&s;cations. A &s;light accident happened, which rai&s;ed a je&s;t that &s;poiled his errand. The King flung the cover of the letter from <HI>Scotland</HI> into the fire, which was carried up all in a flame, and &s;et the chim|ney on fire: Upon which it was &s;aid, that the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> letter had fired <HI>Whitehall:</HI> And it was an&s;wered, the cover had almo&s;t &s;et <HI>Whitehall</HI> on fire, but the contents of it would certainly &s;et <HI>Scot|land</HI> all in a flame. It was &s;aid, that the law for renouncing the Covenant inferring only a forfeiture of employments to tho&s;e who refu&s;ed it, the &s;tretching it &s;o far as was now propo&s;ed would be liable to great exception. Yet in compliance with a publick me&s;&s;age the in&s;truction was &s;ent down, as it was de&s;ired: But by a private letter Lord <HI>Rothes</HI> was ordered to make no u&s;e of it, except upon a &s;pecial command; &s;ince the King had only gi|ven way to what was de&s;ired, to &s;trike terrour in the ill affected. The &s;ecret of it broke out: So it had no effect, but to make the Lord <HI>Rothes</HI> and his party more odious. <HI>Burnet,</HI> upon <HI>Sharp</HI>'s di&s;grace, grew to be more con&s;idered. So he was &s;ent up with a propo&s;ition of a very extraordinary nature, that the we&s;tern Counties &s;hould be cantoned under a &s;pecial government, and pe|culiar taxes, together with the quartering of &s;ouldiers upon them. It was &s;aid, that tho&s;e Counties put the nation to the charge of keeping up &s;uch a force: And therefore it &s;eemed rea&s;onable that the charge &s;hould lye wholly on them. He al&s;o propo|&s;ed, that a &s;pecial Council &s;hould be appointed to &s;it at <HI>Gla&s;|gow:</HI> And, among other rea&s;ons to enforce that motion, he &s;aid to the King, and afterwards to Lord <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> that &s;ome at the Council board were ill affected to the Church, and favour|ed her enemies, and that traitors had been pleaded for at that board. Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> writ down pre&s;ently to know what ground there was for this; &s;ince, if it was not true, he had <HI>Bur|net</HI>
<PB N="241" REF="256">
at mercy for lea&s;ing making, which was more criminal when the whole Council was concerned in the lie that was made. The only ground for this was, that one of the rebels, excepted in the indemnity that was proclaimed &s;ome time before, being taken, and, it being evident that his brain was turned, it was debated in Council, whether he &s;hould be proceeded again&s;t, or not: Some argued again&s;t that, and &s;aid, it would be a reproach to the Government to hang a madman. This could in no &s;ort ju&s;tify &s;uch a charge: So Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> re&s;olved to make u&s;e of it in due time. The propo&s;ition it&s;elf was rejected, as that which the King could not do by law. <HI>Burnet</HI> upon this went to the Lord <HI>Clarendon,</HI> and laid before him the &s;aid e&s;tate of their af|fairs in <HI>Scotland.</HI> He &s;poke to the King of it: And he took care to &s;et the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops on the King, with whom <HI>Burnet</HI> had more credit, as more entirely theirs, than ever <HI>Sharp</HI> had. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s credit was then declining: And it was a clear &s;ign of it, when the King told Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> all that he had &s;aid to him on <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> affairs, which provoked him extreamly. <HI>Burnet</HI> was &s;ent down with good words: But the King was re|&s;olved to put the affairs of <HI>Scotland</HI> under another management. Lord <HI>Kincardin</HI> came down in <HI>April,</HI> and told me, that Lord <HI>Rothes</HI> was to be &s;tript of all his places, and to be only Lord Chan|cellour. The Earl of <HI>Tweedale</HI> and Sir <HI>Robert Murray</HI> were to have the &s;ecret in their hands. He told me, the peace was as good as made: And when that was done, the Army would be di&s;|banded; and things would be managed with more temper, both in Church and State. This was then &s;o great a &s;ecret, that nei|ther the Lord <HI>Rothes,</HI> nor the two Archbi&s;hops, had the lea&s;t hint of it. Some time after this Lord <HI>Rothes</HI> went to the North: Upon which an accident happened that ha&s;tened his fall.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> had during the war &s;et out many privateers; and the&s;e had brought in many rich prizes. The <HI>Dutch,</HI> being pro|voked <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> fleet came into the <HI>Frith.</HI></NOTE> with this, &s;ent <HI>Van Gheudt</HI> with a good fleet into the <HI>Frith,</HI> to burn the coa&s;t, and to recover &s;uch &s;hips as were in that part. He came into the <HI>Frith</HI> on the fir&s;t of <HI>May.</HI> If he had at fir&s;t hung out <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> colours, and attacked <HI>Leith</HI> harbour immediately, which was then full of &s;hips, he might have done what mi&s;chief he plea&s;ed: For all were &s;ecure, and were looking for Sir <HI>Jeremy Smith</HI> with &s;ome frigats for the defence of the coa&s;t, &s;ince the King had &s;et out no fleet this year. There had been &s;uch a di&s;&s;ipation of trea&s;ure, that, for all the money that was given, there was not enough left to &s;et out a fleet. But the Court covered this by &s;aying, the peace was as good as conclu|ded at <HI>Breda,</HI> where the Lord <HI>Hollis</HI> and Sir <HI>William Cov$ntry</HI>
<PB N="242" REF="257">
were treating about it as Plenipotentaries: And, tho' no ce&s;&s;ation was agreed on, yet they reckoned on it as &s;ure. Upon this, a &s;aying of the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI>'s was much repeated: When it was &s;aid, that the Kings mi&s;tre&s;s was like to ruine the Nation, he &s;aid, it was &s;he that &s;aved the Nation. While we had a Hou&s;e of Commons that gave all the money that was a&s;ked, it was better to have the money &s;quandred away in luxury and pro|digality, than to have it &s;aved for wor&s;e purpo&s;es. <HI>Van Gheud$</HI> did nothing in the <HI>Frith</HI> for &s;ome hours: He &s;hot again&s;t <HI>Brun|ti&s;land</HI> without doing any mi&s;chief. The country people ran down to the coa&s;t, and made a great &s;how. But this was only a faint, to divert the King from that which was chiefly intended: For he &s;ailed out, and joined <HI>de Ruyter:</HI> And &s;o the &s;hameful at|tack was made upon the river of <HI>Medway:</HI> The chain at the mouth of it, which was then all its &s;ecurity, was broke: And the <HI>Dutch</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">And went to <HI>Chatham,</HI> and burnt our Fleet.</NOTE> fle$t &s;ailed up to <HI>Chatham:</HI> Of which I will &s;ay no more in this place, but go on with the affairs of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Lord <HI>Rothes</HI>'s being out of the way when the country was in &s;uch danger, was &s;everely aggravated by the Lord <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> and did bring on the change &s;omewhat the &s;ooner. In <HI>June</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Murray</HI> came down with a letter from the King, &s;u|per&s;eding Lord <HI>Rothes</HI>'s commi&s;&s;ion, putting the Trea&s;ury in com|mi&s;&s;ion, and making Lord <HI>Rothes</HI> Lord <HI>Chancellour.</HI> He excu|&s;ed him&s;elf from being rai&s;ed to that po&s;t all he could; and de&s;ired to continue Lord Trea&s;urer: But he &s;truggled in vain, and was forced to &s;ubmit at la&s;t. Now all was turned to a more &s;o|ber, and more moderate management. Even <HI>Sharp</HI> grew meek and humble: And &s;aid to my &s;elf, it was a great happine&s;s to have to deal with &s;ober and &s;erious men; for Lord <HI>Rothes</HI> and his crew were perpetually drunk. When the peace of <HI>Breda</HI> was concluded, the King wrote to the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Council, and commu|nicated that to them; and with that &s;ignified, that it was his plea&s;ure that the Army &s;hould be disbanded. The Earl of <HI>Rothes, Burnet,</HI> and all the officers oppo&s;ed this much. The rebellious di&s;po&s;ition of the we&s;tern Counties was much aggravated: It &s;eem|ed nece&s;&s;ary to govern them by a military power. Several expe|dients were propo&s;ed on the other hand. In&s;tead of renouncing the Covenant, in which they pretended there were many points of religion concerned, a bond was propo&s;ed for keeping the peace, and again&s;t ri&s;ing in arms. This &s;eemed the better te&s;t; &s;ince it &s;ecured the publick quiet, and the peace of the Country, which was at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary: The religious part was to be left to time, and good management. So an indemnity of a more comprehen&s;ive nature was proclaimed: And the bond was all the
<PB N="243" REF="258">
&s;ecurity that was demanded. Many came into the bond: Tho' there were &s;ome among them that pretended &s;cruples: For, it was &s;aid, peace was a word of a large extent: It might be pretended, that obeying all the laws was implied in it. Yet the far great|er number &s;ubmitted to this. Tho&s;e who were di&s;turbed with &s;cruples were a few melancholy incon&s;iderable per&s;ons.</P>
<P>In Order to the di&s;banding the Army with more &s;ecurity it was propo&s;ed, that a County militia &s;hould be rai&s;ed, and train|ed for &s;ecuring the publick peace. The two Archbi&s;hops did not like this: They &s;aid, the Commons, of whom the militia mu&s;t be compo&s;ed, being generally ill affected to the Church, this would be a prejudice rather than a &s;ecurity. But, to con|tent them, it was concluded, that in Counties that were ill affec|ed there &s;hould be no foot rai&s;ed, and only &s;ome troops of hor&s;e. <HI>Burnet</HI> complained openly, that he &s;aw Epi&s;copacy was to be pulled down, and that in &s;uch an extremity he could not look on, and be &s;ilent. He writ upon the&s;e matters a long and &s;or|rowful letter to <HI>Sheldon:</HI> And upon that <HI>Sheldon</HI> writ a very long one to Sir <HI>R. Murray;</HI> which I read, and found more temper and moderation in it, than I could have expected from him. <HI>Murray</HI> had got &s;o far into his confidence, and he &s;eemed to depend &s;o entirely on his &s;incerity, that no informations again&s;t him could work upon <HI>Sheldon.</HI> Upon <HI>Burnet</HI>'s carrying things &s;o high, <HI>Sharp</HI> was better u&s;ed, and was brought again to the Council board, where he began to talk of moderation: And in the debate concerning the di&s;banding the Army, he &s;aid, it was better to expo&s;e the Bi&s;hops to what&s;oever might happen, than to have the Kingdom governed for their &s;akes by a military power. Yet in private he &s;tudied to po&s;&s;e&s;s all people with pre|judices again&s;t the per&s;ons then employed, as the enemies of the Church. At that time Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> got the King to write to the Privy Council, letting them know that he had been informed, traitors had been pleaded for at that board. This was levelled at <HI>Burnet.</HI> The Council in their an&s;wer, as they denied the imputation, &s;o they de&s;ired to know, who it was that had &s;o a&s;per&s;ed them. <HI>Burnet,</HI> when the letter was offered to him to be &s;igned by him, &s;aid, he could not &s;ay traitors had never been pleaded for at that board, &s;ince he him&s;elf had once pleaded for one, and put them in mind of the particular ca&s;e. After this he &s;aw how much he had expo&s;ed him&s;elf, and grew tamer. The Army was di&s;banded: So Lord <HI>Rothes</HI>'s authority as General, as well as his commi&s;&s;ion, was now at an end, after it had la&s;ted three years. The pretence of his commi&s;&s;ion was the preparing matters for a National Synod: Yet in all that time
<PB N="244" REF="259">
there was not one &s;tep made towards one: For the Bi&s;hops &s;eem|ed concerned only for their authority, and their revenues, and took no care of regulating, either the wor&s;hip, or the di&s;ci|pline. The Earls of <HI>Rothes</HI> and <HI>Tweedale</HI> went to Court. The former tried, what he could do by the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s means, who had married his niece: But he was then young, and was engaged in a mad-ramble after plea&s;ure, and minded no bu&s;ine&s;s. So Lord <HI>Rothes</HI> &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of applying him&s;elf to Lord <HI>Lauderdale:</HI> And he did di&s;&s;emble his di&s;content &s;o dex|trou&s;ly, that he &s;eemed well plea&s;ed to be freed from the load of bu&s;ine&s;s, that lay &s;o heavy upon him. He moved to have his ac|counts of the Trea&s;ury pa&s;s'd, to which great exceptions might have been made; and to have an approbation pa&s;s'd under the Great Seal of all he had done while he was the King's Commi&s;&s;ioner. Lord <HI>Tweedale</HI> was again&s;t both; and moved, that, he &s;hould be for &s;ome time kept under the la&s;h: He knew, that, how humble &s;oever he was at that time, he would be no &s;ooner &s;ecured from being called to an account for what was pa&s;s'd, than he would &s;et up a cabal in oppo&s;ition to every thing; whereas they were &s;ure of his good behaviour, as long as he continued to be &s;o ob|noxious. The King loved Lord <HI>Rothes:</HI> So the Earl of <HI>Lau|derdale</HI> con&s;ented to all he a&s;ked. But they quickly &s;aw good cau&s;e to repent of their forwardne&s;s.</P>
<P>At this time a great change happened in the cour&s;e of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A great change in <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s temper.</NOTE> Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s life, which made the latter part of it very different from what the former had been. Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> of the bedchamber had been page and whipping boy to King <HI>Charles</HI> I; and had great credit with him, not only in procuring private favours, but in all his coun&s;els. He was well turned for a Court, very in&s;inuating, but very fal&s;e; and of &s;o revengeful a temper, that rather than any of the coun&s;els given by his enemies &s;hould &s;ucceed, he would have revealed them, and betrayed both the King and them. It was generally believed, that he had di&s;|covered the mo&s;t important of all his &s;ecrets to his enemies. He had one particular quality, that when he was drunk, which was very often, he was upon a mo&s;t exact re&s;erve, tho' he was pretty open at all other times. He got a warrant to be an Earl, which was &s;igned at <HI>New-Ca&s;tle.</HI> Yet he got the King to antedate it, as if it had been &s;igned at <HI>Oxford,</HI> to get the pre|cedence of &s;ome whom he hated: But he did not pa&s;s it under the Great Seal during the King's life; but did it after his death, tho' his warrant, not being pa&s;s'd, died with the King. His elde&s;t daughter, to whom his honour, &s;uch as it was, de&s;cended, mar|ried Sir <HI>Lionel Tallma&s;h</HI> of <HI>Su&s;&s;olk,</HI> a man of a noble family. Af|ter
<PB N="245" REF="260">
her father's death, &s;he took the title of Counte&s;s of <HI>Dy&s;ert.</HI> She was a woman of great beauty, but of far greater parts. She had a wonderful quickne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, and an amazing vi|vacity in conver&s;ation. She had &s;tudied not only divinity and hi|&s;tory, but mathematicks and philo&s;ophy. She was violent in every thing &s;he &s;et about, a violent friend, but a much more vi|olent enemy. She had a re&s;tle&s;s ambition, lived at a va&s;t ex|pence, and was ravenou&s;ly covetous; and would have &s;tuck at nothing by which &s;he might compa&s;s her ends. She had been early in a corre&s;pondence with Lord <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> that had giv|en $span$on to cen&s;ure. When he was pri&s;oner after <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> fig$span$, &s;he made him believe he was in great danger of his life, and that &s;he &s;aved it by her intrigues with <HI>Cromwell:</HI> Which was not a little taken notice of. <HI>Cromwell</HI> was certainly fond of her, and &s;he took care to entertain him in it; till he, finding what was &s;aid upon it, broke it off. Upon the King's Re&s;toration, &s;he thought that Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> made not tho&s;e returns that &s;he expected. They lived for &s;ome years at a di&s;tance. But upon her hu&s;band's death &s;he made up all quarrels: So that Lord <HI>Lau|derdale</HI> and &s;he lived &s;o much together, that his Lady was of|fended at it, and went to <HI>Paris,</HI> where &s;he died about three years after. The Lady <HI>Dy&s;ert</HI> came to have &s;o much power over the Lord <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> that it le&s;&s;ened him much in e&s;teem of all the world; for he delivered him&s;elf up to all her humours and pa&s;|&s;ions. All applications were made to her: She took upon her to determine every thing: She &s;old all places, and was wanting in no methods that could bring her money, which &s;he lavi&s;hed out in a mo&s;t profu&s;e vanity. As the conceit took her, &s;he made him fall out with all his friends, one after another: With the Earls of <HI>Argile, Tweedale,</HI> and <HI>Kincardin,</HI> with Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Athol,</HI> and Sir <HI>Robert Murray,</HI> who all had their turns in her di&s;plea&s;ure, which very quickly drew Lord <HI>Lauder|dale</HI>'s after it. If after &s;uch names it is not a pre&s;umption to name my &s;elf, I had my &s;hare likewi&s;e. From that time to the end of his days he became quite another &s;ort of man than he had been in all the former parts of his life. Sir <HI>Robert Mur|ray</HI> had been de&s;igned by her father to be her hu&s;band, and was long her true friend. She knew his integrity was proof again&s;t all attempts. He had been hitherto the Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s chief friend, and main &s;upport. He had great e&s;teem paid him, both by the King, and by the whole Court: And he employed it all for the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s &s;ervice. He u&s;ed great freedom with him at proper times; and was a faithful advi&s;er, and reprover as much as the other could bear it. Lady <HI>Dy&s;ert</HI> laid hold on
<PB N="246" REF="261">
his ab&s;ence in <HI>Scotland</HI> to make a breach between them. She made Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> believe, that <HI>Murray</HI> a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf the prai&s;e of all that was done, and was not ill plea&s;ed to pa&s;s as his Governour. Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s pride was &s;oon fired with tho&s;e ill impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The government of <HI>Scotland</HI> had now another face. All <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Scotland</HI> was very well governed.</NOTE> payments were regularly made: There was an overplus of 10000 <HI>l.</HI> of the revenue &s;aved every year: A magazine of Arms was bought with it: And there were &s;everal projects &s;et on foot for the en|couragement of trade and manufactures. Lord <HI>Tweedale,</HI> and Sir <HI>Robert Murray</HI> were &s;o entirely united, that, as they never di&s;|agreed, &s;o all plied before them. Lord <HI>Tweedale</HI> was made a Privy Coun&s;ellour in <HI>England:</HI> And, his &s;on having married the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s only child, they &s;eemed to be in&s;eparably united. When he came down from <HI>London,</HI> he brought a let|ter from the King to the Council, recommending the concerns of the Church to their care: In particular, he charged them to &s;uppre&s;s Conventicles, which began to &s;pread generally thro' the we&s;tern Counties: For upon the di&s;banding the Army, the coun|try, being delivered from that terror, did now for&s;ake their Church|es, and got their old Mini&s;ters to come among them; and they were not wanting in holding Conventicles from place to place. The King wrote al&s;o by him a letter to <HI>Sharp</HI> with his own pen, in which he a&s;&s;ured him of his zeal for the Church, and of his fa|vour to him&s;elf. Lord <HI>Tweedale</HI> hoped this would have gained him to his &s;ide: But he was deceived in it. <HI>Sharp</HI> quickly re|turned to his former in&s;olence. Upon the Earl of <HI>Tweedale</HI>'s re|turn, there was a great application to publick bu&s;ine&s;s: No vice was in reputation: Ju&s;tice was impartially admini&s;tred: And a commi&s;&s;ion was &s;ent to the we&s;tern Counties to examine into all the complaints of unju&s;t and illegal oppre&s;&s;ions by <HI>Turner, Dal|ziel,</HI> and others. <HI>Turner</HI>'s warrants had been &s;eized with him|&s;elf: And, tho' upon the defeat given the Whiggs he was left by them, &s;o that, beyond all men's expectations, he e&s;caped out of their hands, yet he had nothing to ju&s;tify him&s;elf by. The truth is, this enquiry was chiefly levelled at Lord <HI>Rothes</HI> and <HI>Burnet,</HI> to ca&s;t the odium of the late rebellion on their inju&s;tice and ill conduct. And it was intended that <HI>Turner</HI> &s;hould accu&s;e them: But he had no vouchers to &s;hew. The&s;e were believed to be withdrawn by an artifice of the Lord <HI>Rothes.</HI> But, before the matter was quite ended, tho&s;e in who&s;e hands his papers were left, &s;ent them &s;ealed up to his lodgings. But he was by that time broken: So, &s;ince the government had u&s;ed him hard|ly, he, who was a man of &s;pirit, would not &s;hew his vouchers,
<PB N="247" REF="262">
nor expo&s;e his friends. So that matter was carried no farther. And the people of the country cried out again&s;t tho&s;e cen&s;ures. It was &s;aid, that when by &s;uch violent proceedings men had been inflamed to a rebellion, upon which &s;o much blood was &s;hed, all the reparation given was, that an officer or two were broken; and a great man was taken down a little upon it, without making any publick examples for the deterring others.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert Murray</HI> went thro' the we&s;t of <HI>Scotland.</HI> When <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great com|plaints made of the Cler|gy.</NOTE> he came back, he told me, the Clergy were &s;uch a &s;et of men, &s;o ignorant, and &s;o &s;candalous, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to &s;up|port them, unle&s;s the greate&s;t part of them could be turned out, and better men found to be put in their places. But it was not ea&s;y to know how this could be done. <HI>Burnet</HI> had placed them all: And he thought him&s;elf in &s;ome &s;ort bound to &s;upport them. The Clergy were &s;o linked together, that none of them could be got to concur in getting proofs of crimes brought again&s;t their brethren. And the people of the country pretended &s;cruples. They &s;aid, to accu&s;e a Mini&s;ter before a Bi&s;hop was an acknow|ledging his juri&s;diction over his Clergy, or, to u&s;e a hard word much in u&s;e among them, it was homologating his power. So <HI>Murray</HI> propo&s;ed, that a Court &s;hould be con&s;tituted by a &s;pe|cial commi&s;&s;ion from the King, made up of &s;ome of the Layity as well as the Clergy, to try the truth of the&s;e &s;candalous reports that went upon the Clergy: And he writ about it to <HI>Sheldon,</HI> who approved of it. <HI>Sharp</HI> al&s;o &s;eemed well plea&s;ed with it, tho' he abhorted it in his heart: For he thought it &s;truck at the root of their authority, and was Era&s;tiani&s;m in the highe&s;t degree. <HI>Burnet</HI> &s;aid, it was a turning him out of his Bi&s;hoprick, and the declaring him either incapable of judging his Clergy, or unwor|thy of that tru&s;t. His Clergy cried out upon it; and &s;aid, it was a delivering them up to the rage of their enemies, who hated them only for the &s;ake of their functions, and for their obedience to the laws; and that, if irregular methods were taken to en|courage them, they would get any thing, true or fal&s;e, to be &s;worn again&s;t them. The difficulties that aro&s;e upon this put a &s;top to it. And the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s aver&s;ion to Sir <HI>Robert Murray</HI> began a disjointing of all the coun&s;els of <HI>Scotland.</HI> Lord <HI>Tweedale</HI> had the chief confidence: And next him Lord <HI>Kincar|din</HI> was mo&s;t tru&s;ted. The Pre&s;byterians, &s;eeing a &s;oftening in the execution of the law, and ob&s;erving that the Archbi&s;hops were jealous of Lord <HI>Tweedale,</HI> fancied he was theirs in his heart. Upon that they grew very in&s;olent. The Clergy was in many places ill u&s;ed by them. They de&s;paired of any farther protec|tion from the Government. They &s;aw de&s;igns were forming to
<PB N="248" REF="263">
turn them all out: And, hearing that they might be better pro|vided in <HI>Ireland,</HI> they were in many places bought out, and pre|vailed on to de&s;ert their cures. The people of the country hop|ed, that, upon their leaving them, they might have their old Mini&s;ters again; and upon that were willing enough to enter in|to tho&s;e bargains with them: And &s;o in a very little time there were many vacancies made all over tho&s;e Counties. The Lord <HI>Tweedale</HI> took great pains to engage <HI>Leightoun</HI> into the &s;ame coun&s;els with him. He had magnified him highly to the King, as much the greate&s;t man of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Clergy. And the Lord <HI>Tweedale</HI>'s chief aim, with relation to Church matters, was to &s;et him at the head of them: For he often &s;aid to me, that more than two parts in three of the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the government related to the Church. So he &s;tudied to bring in a &s;et of Epi&s;|copal men of another &s;tamp, and to &s;et <HI>Leightoun</HI> at their head. He &s;tudied to draw in Mr. <HI>Charteris.</HI> But he had &s;uch &s;ad thoughts of mankind, and &s;uch humble ones of him&s;elf, that he thought little good could be done, and that as to that little he was not a proper in&s;trument. <HI>Leightoun</HI> was prevailed on to go to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> where, as he told me, he had two audiences of the King. He laid before him the madne&s;s of the former admini&s;tration of Church affairs, and the nece&s;&s;ity of turning to more moderate coun&s;els: In particular, he propo&s;ed a comprehen&s;ion of the Pre&s;|byterian party, by altering the terms of the laws a little, and by &s;uch abatements as might pre&s;erve the whole for the future, by granting &s;omewhat for the pre&s;ent. But he entered into no ex|pedients: Only he &s;tudied to fix the King in the de&s;ign that the cour&s;e of his affairs led him to, tho' contrary to his own incli|nations, both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI> In order to the open|ing this I mu&s;t change the &s;cene.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> war had turned &s;o fatally on the King, that it <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> made it nece&s;&s;ary for him to try how to recover the affections and e&s;teem of his people. He found a &s;lackening the execution of the law went a great way in the city of <HI>London,</HI> and with the trading part of the Nation. The Hou&s;e of Commons continu|ed &s;till in their fiercene&s;s, and aver&s;ion to all moderate propo&s;i|tions: But in the intervals of Parliament the execution was &s;of|tened. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> found his credit was declining, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Clarendon</HI>'s di&s;grace</NOTE> that all the &s;ecrets of State were tru&s;ted to <HI>Bennet,</HI> and that he had no other &s;hare in them than his po&s;t required. The Lady <HI>Ca&s;tlemain</HI> &s;et her &s;elf mo&s;t violently again&s;t him. And the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> as often as he was admitted to any familiarities with the King, &s;tudied with all his wit and humour to make Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> and all his coun&s;els appear ridiculous. Lively
<PB N="249" REF="264">
je&s;ts were at all times apt to take with the King. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> fell under two other misfortunes before the war broke out. The King had granted him a large piece of ground near St. <HI>James</HI>'s to build a hou&s;e on: He intended a good ordinary hou&s;e: But, not under&s;tanding tho&s;e matters him&s;elf, he put the managing of that into the hands of others; who run him into a va&s;t charge, of about 50000 <HI>l,</HI> three times as much as he had de&s;igned to lay out upon it. During the war, and in the plague year, he had about three hundred men at work, which he thought would have been an acceptable thing, when &s;o many men were kept at work, and &s;o much money, as was duly paid, circulated about. But it had a contrary effect. It rai&s;ed a great outcry again&s;t him. Some called it <HI>Dunkirk</HI> hou&s;e, intimating that it was built by his &s;hare of the price of <HI>Dunkirk.</HI> Others called it <HI>Holland</HI> hou&s;e, becau&s;e he was believed to be no friend to the war: So it was given out, that he had the money from the <HI>Dutch.</HI> It was vi&s;ible, that in a time of publick calamity he was building a very noble palace. Another accident was, that be|fore the war there were &s;ome de&s;igns on foot for the repairing of St. <HI>Pauls:</HI> And many &s;tones were brought thither. That project was laid a&s;ide during the war. He upon that bought the &s;tones, and made u&s;e of them in building his own hou&s;e. This, how &s;light &s;oever it may &s;eem to be, yet had a great ef|fect by the management of his enemies.</P>
<P>Another misfortune was, that he lo&s;t his chief friend, to whom <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Southamp|ton</HI>'s death</NOTE> he tru&s;ted mo&s;t, and who was his greate&s;t &s;upport, the Earl of <HI>Southampton.</HI> The pain of the &s;tone grew upon him to &s;uch a degree, that he had re&s;olved to be cut: But a woman came to him, who pretended &s;he had an infallible &s;ecret for di&s;&s;olving the &s;tone, and brought &s;uch vouchers to him, that he put him|&s;elf into her hands. The medicine had a great operation, tho' it ended fatally: For he pa&s;&s;ed great quantities of gravel, that looked like the coats of a &s;tone &s;liced of. This encouraged him to go on, till his pains encrea&s;ed &s;o, that no man was ever &s;een to die in &s;uch torments; which made him oft tremble all over, &s;o that the bed &s;hook with it: Yet he bore it with an a&s;toni&s;h|ing patience. He not only kept him&s;elf from &s;aying any inde|cent thing, but endured all that mi&s;ery with the firmne&s;s of a great man, and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of a good chri&s;tian. The cau&s;e of all appeared when he was opened after his death: For the medicine had &s;trip'd the &s;tone of its outward &s;limy coats, which made it lye &s;oft and ea&s;y upon the mu&s;cles of the bladder; where|as when the&s;e were di&s;&s;olved, the inner and harder parts of the &s;tone, that were all ragged by the di&s;&s;olution that was begun,
<PB N="250" REF="265">
lay upon the neck of the bladder, which rai&s;ed tho&s;e violent pains of which he died. The Court was now delivered of a great man, whom they did not much love, and who they knew did not love them. The Trea&s;ury was put in commi&s;&s;ion: And the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> had no intere&s;t there. He &s;aw the war, tho' manag|ed by other coun&s;els, yet was like to end in his ruine: For all errors were ca&s;t on him. The bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Chatham</HI> was a terri|ble blow: And tho' the lo&s;s was great, the infamy was greater. The Parliament had given above five millions towards the war: But, thro' the luxury and wa&s;te of the Court, this money was &s;o &s;quandred away, that the King could neither &s;et out a fleet, nor defend his coa&s;ts. Upon the news of the <HI>Dutch</HI> fleet's being in the river, the King did not ride down him&s;elf, nor appear at the head of his people, who were then in &s;uch imminent danger. He only &s;ent the Duke of <HI>Albemarle</HI> down, and was intending to retire to <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI> But that looked &s;o like a flying from danger, that he was prevailed on to &s;tay. And it was given out, that he was very chearful that night at &s;upper with his Mi&s;tri&s;&s;es, which drew many libels upon him, that were writ with as much wit as malice, and brought him under a general contempt. He was com|pared to <HI>Nero,</HI> who &s;ung while <HI>Rome</HI> was burning. A day or two after that he rode thro' <HI>London,</HI> accompanied with the mo&s;t popular men of his Court, and a&s;&s;ured the citizens he would live and die with his people, upon which there were &s;ome ac|clamations: But the matter went heavily. The City was yet in a&s;hes: And the jealou&s;y of burning it on de&s;ign had got &s;o among them, that the King him&s;elf was not free from &s;u&s;picion. If the <HI>Dutch</HI> had pur&s;ued their advantage in the fir&s;t con&s;ternation, they might have done more mi&s;chief, and have come a great way up the <HI>Thames,</HI> and burnt many merchant &s;hips: But they thought they had done enough, and &s;o they &s;ailed away. The Court was at a &s;tand what to do: For the <HI>French</HI> had a&s;&s;ured them the treaty was as good as fini&s;hed. Whether the <HI>French</HI> &s;et this on, as that which would both weaken the fleet of <HI>En|gland,</HI> and alienate the King &s;o entirely from the <HI>Dutch</HI> that he would be ea&s;ily engaged into new alliances to revenge this affront, as many believed, I cannot pretend to determine.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was at that time in <HI>Paris,</HI> on his way home from the waters of <HI>Bourbon:</HI> And he told me, the Queen-mo|ther of <HI>England</HI> &s;ent for him, as being one of her &s;on's Privy Council; and told him, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> had &s;ent over &s;ome to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> de&s;iring money and arms with &s;ome officers, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> &s;ought the protection of <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> undertook to put that i&s;land into the hands of the <HI>French.</HI> He told me, he found the Queen was in her inclinations and advices
<PB N="251" REF="266">
true to her &s;on's intere&s;t: But he was amazed to &s;ee, that a wo|man, who in a drawing room was the livelie&s;t woman of the age, and had a vicacity of imagination that &s;urprized all who came near her, yet after all her practice in affairs had &s;o little either of judgment or conduct: And he did not wonder at the mi&s;car|riage of the late King's coun&s;els, &s;ince &s;he had &s;uch a &s;hare in them. But the <HI>French</HI> had then greater things in view. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> was dead. And now after the <HI>French</HI> had manag|ed the war &s;o, that they had been at no part of the expence of it, nor brought a &s;hip to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Dutch</HI> in any en|gagement, and that both <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> had made a great lo&s;s both in &s;hips and trea&s;ure; they re&s;olved to manage the peace &s;o, as to oblige the King by giving him a peace, when he was in no condition to carry on a war. I enter not into our negotia|tion with the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> nor his treacherous departing from his engagements, &s;ince I know nothing of that matter, but what is in print.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the peace was made, the King &s;aw with what di&s;|advantage he was like to meet his Parliament. So he thought, the di&s;gracing a publick Mini&s;ter, who by his being long in &s;o high a po&s;t had drawn upon him&s;elf much envy, and many ene|mies, would cover him&s;elf and the re&s;t of his Court. Other things concurred to &s;et this forward. The King was grown ve|ry weary of the Queen: And it was believed, he had a great mind to be rid of her. The load of that marriage was ca&s;t on the Lord <HI>Clarendon,</HI> as made on de&s;ign to rai&s;e his own grandchil|dren. Many members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, &s;uch as <HI>Clif|ford, Osborn, Ker, Littleton,</HI> and <HI>Seimour,</HI> were brought to the King; who all a&s;&s;ured him, that upon his Re&s;toration they in|tended both to have rai&s;ed his authority, and to have encrea&s;|ed his revenue; but that the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> had di&s;couraged it, and that all his creatures had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e with &s;uch jealou&s;ies of the King, that they thought it was not fit to tru&s;t him too much, nor too far. This made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the King, who was weary of Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s impo&s;ing way, and had a mind to be freed from the authority, to which he had been &s;o long accu&s;tomed that it was not ea&s;y to keep him with|in bounds.</P>
<P>Yet the King was &s;o afraid to engage him&s;elf too deep in <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Rub|mond</HI>'s mar|riage.</NOTE> his own affairs, that it was a doubt whether he would di&s;mi&s;s him or not, if a concern of one of his amours had not &s;harpened his re&s;entment; &s;o that what other con&s;iderations could not do, was brought about by an ill grounded jealou&s;y. Mi&s;tri&s;s <HI>Steward</HI> had gained &s;o much on the King, and yet had kept her ground with
<PB N="252" REF="267">
&s;o much firmne&s;s, that the King &s;eemed to de&s;ign if po&s;&s;ible to legitimate his addre&s;&s;es to her, when he &s;aw no hope of &s;ucceed|ing any other way. The Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> being a widower, courted her. The King &s;eemed to give way to it; and pretend|ed to take &s;uch care of her, that he would have good &s;ettle|ments made for her. He hoped by that means to have broke the matter decently; for he knew the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI>'s affairs were in di&s;order. So the King ordered Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> to ex|amine the e&s;tate he pretended to &s;ettle. But he was told, whe|ther true or fal&s;e I cannot tell, that Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> told her, that the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI>'s affairs, it was true, were not very clear; but that a family &s;o near related to the King could never be left in di&s;tre&s;s, and that &s;uch a match would not come in her way every day; &s;o &s;he had be&s;t con&s;ider well, before &s;he rejected it. This was carried to the King, as a de&s;ign he had that the Crown might de&s;cend to his own grandchildren; and that he was afraid, le&s;t &s;trange methods &s;hould be taken to get rid of the Queen, and to make way for her. When the King &s;aw that &s;he had a mind to marry the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> he offered to make her a Duche&s;s, and to &s;ettle an e&s;tate on her. Upon this &s;he &s;aid, &s;he &s;aw &s;he mu&s;t either marry him, or &s;uffer much in the opi|nion of the world. And &s;he was prevailed on by the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> who was pa&s;&s;ionately in love with her, to go private|ly from <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and marry him without giving the King notice. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s &s;on, the Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> was going to her lodgings, upon &s;ome a&s;&s;ignation that &s;he had giv|en him about her affairs, knowing nothing of her intentions. He met the King in the door coming out full of fury. And he, &s;u&s;pecting that Lord <HI>Cornbury</HI> was in the de&s;ign, &s;poke to him as one in a rage that forgot all decency, and for &s;ome time would not hear Lord <HI>Cornbury</HI> &s;peak in his own defence. In the afternoon he heard him with more temper, as he him&s;elf told me. Yet this made &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion, that he re&s;olved to take the &s;eals from his father. The King &s;aid to the Lord <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> that he had talked of the matter with <HI>Sheldon;</HI> and that he convinced him, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to remove Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> from his po&s;t. And, as &s;oon as it was done, the King &s;ent for <HI>Sheldon,</HI> and told him what he had done. But he an|&s;wered nothing. When the King in&s;i&s;ted to oblige him to de|clare him&s;elf, he &s;aid, <HI>Sir, I wi&s;h you would put away this wo|man that you keep.</HI> The King upon that replied &s;harply, why had he never talked to him of that &s;ooner, but took this occa|&s;ion now to &s;peak of it. <HI>Lauderdale</HI> told me, he had all this from the King: And that the King and <HI>Sheldon</HI> had gone in|to
<PB N="253" REF="268">
&s;uch expo&s;tulations upon it, that from that day forward <HI>Shel|don</HI> could never recover the King's confidence.</P>
<P>The &s;eals were given to Sir <HI>Orlando Bridgman,</HI> Lord Chief <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bridgman</HI> made Lord Keeper.</NOTE> Ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas, then in great e&s;teem, which he did not maintain long after his advancement. His &s;tudy and practice lay &s;o intirely in the Common law, that he never &s;eem|ed to apprehend what equity was: Nor had he a head made for bu&s;ine&s;s, or for &s;uch a Court. He was a man of great integri|ty, and had very &s;erious impre&s;&s;ions of religion on his mind. He had been always on the &s;ide of the Church: Yet he had great tenderne&s;s for the Non-conformi&s;ts: And, the Bi&s;hops having all declared for Lord <HI>Clarendon,</HI> except one or two, he and the new &s;cene of the Mini&s;try were inclined to favour them. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who had been in high di&s;grace before Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s fall, came upon that into great favour, and &s;et up for a patron of liberty of con&s;cience, and of all the &s;ects. The See of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> happened to fall vacant &s;oon after: And Doc|tor <HI>Wilkins</HI> was by his means promoted to that See. It was no &s;mall prejudice to him, that he was recommended by &s;o bad a man. <HI>Wilkins</HI> had a courage in him that could &s;tand again&s;t a current, and again&s;t all the reproaches with which ill natured Clergy-men &s;tudied to load him. He &s;aid, he was called for by the King, without any motion of his own, to a publick &s;tation, in which he would endeavour to do all the good he could, with|out con&s;idering the ill effects that it might have on him&s;elf. The King had &s;uch a command of him&s;elf, that when his inter|e&s;t led him to &s;erve any end, or to court any &s;ort of men, he did it &s;o dextrou&s;ly, and with &s;uch an air of &s;incerity, that till men were well practi&s;ed in him, he was apt to impo&s;e on them. He &s;eemed now to go into moderation and comprehen&s;ion with &s;o much heartine&s;s, that both <HI>Bridgman</HI> and <HI>Wilkins</HI> believed he was in earne&s;t in it: Tho' there was nothing that the Popi&s;h coun|&s;els were more fixed in, than to oppo&s;e all motions of that kind. But the King &s;aw, it was nece&s;&s;ary to recover the affections of his people. And, &s;ince the Church of <HI>England</HI> was now gone off from him, upon Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s di&s;grace, he re&s;olved to &s;hew &s;ome favour to the &s;ects, both to &s;often them, and to force the others to come back to their dependence upon him.</P>
<P>He began al&s;o to expre&s;s his concerns in the affairs of <HI>Europe:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> King's pre|ten&s;ions to <HI>Flanders.</HI></NOTE> And he brought about the peace between <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> and <HI>Portugal.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> King pretended, that by the law of <HI>Brabant</HI> his Queen, as the heir of the late King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s fir&s;t marriage, tho' a daughter, was to be preferred to the young King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the heir of the &s;econd venter, without any regard to the re|nounciation
<PB N="254" REF="269">
of any &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to his Queen &s;tipulated by the peace of the <HI>Pyrenees;</HI> and was upon that preten&s;ion like to over run the <HI>Netherlands. Temple</HI> was &s;ent over to enter into an alliance with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> by which &s;ome parts of <HI>$larders</HI> were yielded up to <HI>France,</HI> but a barrier was pre&s;erved for the &s;ecurity of <HI>Hol|land.</HI> Into this the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> then a child, was engag|ed: So it was called the Triple Alliance. I will &s;ay no more of that &s;ince &s;o particular an account is given of it by him who could do it be&s;t, <HI>Temple</HI> him&s;elf. It was certainly the ma&s;ter|piece of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s life: And, if he had &s;tuck to it, it would have been both the &s;trength and the glory of his reign. This di&s;|po&s;ed his people to forgive all that was pa&s;s'd, and to renew their confidence in him, which was much &s;haken by the whole con|duct of the <HI>Dutch</HI> war.</P>
<P>The Parliament were upon their fir&s;t opening &s;et on to de&s;troy <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Clarendon</HI>'s integrity.</NOTE> Lord <HI>Clarendon.</HI> Some of his friends went to him a few days before the Parliament met; and told him, many were at work to find out matter of accu&s;ation again&s;t him. He be&s;t knew, what could be brought again&s;t him with any truth; for fal&s;ehood was infinite, and could not be gue&s;&s;ed at. They de&s;ired, he would tru&s;t &s;ome of them with what might break out, &s;ince pro|bably nothing could lye concealed again&s;t &s;o &s;trict a &s;earch. And the method in which his friends mu&s;t manage for him, if there was any mixture or allay in him, was to be very different from that they could u&s;e, if he was &s;ure that nothing could be brought out again&s;t him. The Lord <HI>B$rlington</HI> and Bi&s;hop <HI>Morley</HI> both told me, they talked to this purpo&s;e to him. Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> upon that told them, that, if either in matters of ju&s;tice, or in any negotiations abroad, he had ever received a farthing, he gave them leave to di&s;own all friend&s;hip to him. The <HI>French</HI> King, hearing he had &s;ent for all the books of the <HI>Louvre</HI> impre&s;&s;ion, had &s;ent the&s;e to him, which he took, as thinking it a trifle, as in|deed it was: And this was the only pre&s;ent he ever had from any foreign Prince: He had never taken any thing by virtue of his of|fice, but that which his predece&s;&s;ours had claimed as a right. But now hue and cry were &s;ent out again&s;t him: And all per&s;ons, who had heard him &s;ay any thing that could bear an ill con&s;truction, were examined. Some thought, they had matters of great weight again&s;t him: And, when they were told the&s;e would not amount to high trea&s;on, they de&s;ired to know what would amount to it.</P>
<P>When twenty three articles were brought into the Hou&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">He was $m|peached in the Hou&s;e of Commons</NOTE> again&s;t him, the next day he de&s;ired his &s;econd &s;on, the now Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> to acquaint the Hou&s;e, that he, hearing what articles were brought again&s;t him, did in order to the
<PB N="255" REF="270">
di&s;patch of the bu&s;ine&s;s, de&s;ire that tho&s;e, who knew be&s;t what their evidence was, would &s;ingle out any one of the articles, that they thought could be be&s;t proved; and, if they could prove that, he would &s;ubmit to the cen&s;ure due upon them all. But tho&s;e, who had the &s;ecret of this in their hands, and knew they could make nothing of it, re&s;olved to put the mat|ter upon a preliminary, in which they hoped to find cau&s;e to hang up the whole affair, and fix upon the Lords the denial of ju&s;tice. So, according to &s;ome few and late precedents, they &s;ent up a general impeachment to the Lords bar of high trea&s;on, without any &s;pecial matter; and demanded, that upon that he might be committed to pri&s;on. They had rea&s;on to believe the Lords would not grant this: And therefore they re&s;olved to in|&s;i&s;t on it; and reckoned, that, when &s;o much money was to be given, the King would prevail with the Lords. Upon this occa&s;ion it appeared, that the private animo&s;ities of a Court could carry them to e&s;tabli&s;h the mo&s;t de&s;tructive precedent that could have been thought on. For if this had pa&s;s'd, then every Mi|ni&s;ter upon a general impeachment was to be ruined, tho' no &s;pecial matter was laid again&s;t him. Yet the King him&s;elf pre&s;&s;|ed this vehemently. It was &s;aid, the very &s;u&s;picions of a Hou&s;e of Commons, e&s;pecially &s;uch a one as this was, was enough to bla&s;t a man, and to &s;ecure him: For there was rea&s;on to think, that every per&s;on &s;o charged would run away, if at liberty. Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s enemies had now gone far: They thought, they were not &s;afe till his head was off: And they apprehended, that, if he were once in pri&s;on, it would be ea&s;y either to find, or at lea&s;t to bring witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him. This matter is all in print: So I will go no farther in the particulars. The Duke was at this time taken with the &s;mall-pox: So he was out of the whole debate. The Peers thought, that a general accu&s;ation was only a clamour, and that their dignities &s;ignified little, if a clamour was enough to &s;end them to pri&s;on. All the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s friends pre&s;&s;ed the King much on his behalf, that he might be &s;uffered to go off gently, and without cen&s;ure, &s;ince he had &s;erved both his father and him&s;elf &s;o long, &s;o faithfully, and with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s. But the King was now &s;o &s;harpened again&s;t him, that, tho' he named no particulars, he expre&s;&s;ed a violent and irreconcilable aver&s;ion to him; which did the King much hurt in the opinion of all that were not engaged in the party. The affair of the King's marriage was the mo&s;t talk|ed of, as that which indeed was the only thing that could in any &s;ort ju&s;tify &s;uch a &s;everity. Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> did prote&s;t, as &s;ome that had it from him&s;elf told me, that he had no other
<PB N="256" REF="271">
hand in that matter, than as a Coun&s;ellour: And in that he ap|pealed to the King him&s;elf. After many debates, and conferences, and prote&s;tations, in which the whole Court went in vi&s;ibly to that which was plainly de&s;tructive both to the King and to the Mini&s;try, the majority of the Hou&s;e &s;tood firm, and adhered to their fir&s;t re&s;olution again&s;t commitment. The Commons were upon that like to carry the matter far again&s;t the Peers, as de|nying ju&s;tice. The King &s;eeing this &s;poke to the Duke, to per|&s;uade Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> to go beyond &s;ea, as the only expedient <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King de&s;ired he would go beyond &s;ea.</NOTE> that was left to make up the breach between the two Hou&s;es: And he let fall &s;ome words of kindne&s;s, in ca&s;e he &s;hould com|ply with this. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> was all obedience and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion; and was charmed with tho&s;e tender words, that the King had &s;aid of him. So, partly to &s;erve the King, and &s;ave him&s;elf and his family, but chiefly that he might not be the oc|ca&s;ion of any difference between the King and the Duke, who had heartily e&s;pou&s;ed his intere&s;t, he went privately beyond &s;ea; and writ a letter from <HI>Calais</HI> to the Hou&s;e of Lords, pro|te&s;ting his innocence in all the points objected to him, and that he had not gone out of the Kingdom for fear, or out of any con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, but only that he might not be the unhap|py occa&s;ion of any difference between the two Hou&s;es, or of ob|&s;tructing publick bu&s;ine&s;s. This put an end to the di&s;pute. But his enemies called it a confe&s;&s;ion of guilt, and a flying from ju|&s;tice: Such colours will people give to the mo&s;t innocent actions.</P>
<P>A Bill was brought in, bani&s;hing him the King's dominions under pain of trea&s;on if he &s;hould return: And it was made <NOTE PLACE="marg">He was ba|ni&s;hed by Act of Par|liament.</NOTE> trea&s;on to corre&s;pond with him, without leave from the King. This Act did not pa&s;s without much oppo&s;ition. It was &s;aid, there was a known cour&s;e of law when any man fled from ju&s;tice: And it &s;eemed again&s;t the common cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, to make all corre&s;ponding with him trea&s;on, when he him&s;elf was not attainted of trea&s;on: Nor could it be ju&s;t to ba|ni&s;h him, unle&s;s a day was given him to come in: And then, if he did not come in, he might incur the puni&s;hment upon contempt. The Duke, whom the King had employed to pre|vail with him to withdraw him&s;elf, thought he was bound in honour to pre&s;s the matter home on the King; which he did &s;o warmly, that for &s;ome time a coldne&s;s between them was very vi&s;ible. The part the King had acted on this matter came to be known; and was much cen&s;ured, as there was ju&s;t cau&s;e for it. The vehemence that he &s;hewed in this whole affair was imputed by many to very different cau&s;es. Tho&s;e who knew him be&s;t, but e&s;teemed him lea&s;t, &s;aid to me on this occa&s;ion,
<PB N="257" REF="272">
that all the indignation, that appeared in him on this head, was founded on no rea&s;on at all; but was an effect of that ea&s;ine&s;s, or rather lazine&s;s of nature, that made him comply with every per&s;on that had the greate&s;t credit with him. The Mi&s;tri&s;s, and the whole Bedchamber, were perpetually railing at him. This by a &s;ort of infection po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the King, who, without giving him|&s;elf the trouble of much thinking, did commonly go into any thing that was at the pre&s;ent time the ea&s;ie&s;t, without con&s;ider|ing what might at any other time follow on it. Thus the Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> fell under the common fate of great Mini&s;ters; who&s;e employment expo&s;es them to envy, and draws upon them the indignation of all who are di&s;appointed in their preten&s;ions. Their friends do generally &s;hew, that they are only the friends of their fortunes: And upon the change of favour they not only for&s;ake them in their extremity, but, that they may &s;ecure to them&s;elves the protection of a new favourite, they will labour to redeem all that is pa&s;s'd by turning as violently again&s;t them, as they formerly fawned abjectly upon them: And Princes are &s;o little &s;en&s;ible of merit or great &s;ervices, that they &s;acrifice their be&s;t &s;ervants, not only when their affairs &s;eem to require it, but to gratify the humour of a mi&s;tri&s;s, or the pa&s;&s;ion of a ri&s;ing favourite.</P>
<P>I will end this relation of Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s fall with an ac|count <NOTE PLACE="marg">The charac|ter of his two &s;ons.</NOTE> of his two &s;ons. The elde&s;t, now the Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> is a man naturally &s;incere: He is a friendly and good natured man. He keeps an exact journal of all that pa&s;&s;es, and is punctual to tediou&s;ne&s;s in all that he relates. He was very early engaged in great &s;ecrets: For his father, apprehending of what fatal con&s;e|quence it would have been to the King's affairs if his corre&s;pon|dence had been di&s;covered by unfaithful Secretaries, engaged him when very young to write all his letters to <HI>England</HI> in cypher; &s;o that he was generally half the day writing in cypher, or de|cyphering, and was &s;o di&s;creet, as well as faithful, that nothing was ever di&s;covered by him. He continued to be &s;till the per|&s;on whom his father tru&s;ted mo&s;t: And was the mo&s;t beloved of all the family; for he was humble and obliging, tho' &s;ome|times peevi&s;h. His judgment was not to be much depended on; for he was much carried by vulgar prejudices, and fal&s;e notions. He was much in the Queen's favour, and was her Chamberlain long. His father's being &s;o violently pro&s;ecuted on the account of her marriage, made that &s;he thought her&s;elf bound to pro|tect him in a particular manner. He was &s;o provoked at the ill u&s;age his father met with, that he &s;truck in violently with the party that oppo&s;ed the Court: And the King &s;poke always
<PB N="258" REF="273">
of him with great &s;harpne&s;s, and much &s;corn. His brother, now Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> is a man of far greater parts. He has a ve|ry good pen, but &s;peaks not gracefully. He was thought the &s;moothe&s;t man in the Court: And during all the di&s;pute con|cerning his father he made his Court &s;o dextrou&s;ly, that no re&s;entments ever appeared on that head. When he came into bu&s;ine&s;s, and ro&s;e to high po&s;ts, he grew violent: But was thought an incorrupt man. He has high notions of Government, and thinks it mu&s;t be maintained with great &s;everity. He delivers up his own notions to his party, that he may lead them. He pa&s;&s;es for a &s;incere man, and &s;eems to have too much heat to be fal&s;e. <HI>Morley</HI> was long Dean of the Chapel: But he &s;tuck &s;o to the Lord <HI>Clarendon,</HI> that he was &s;ent into his dioce&s;e: And <HI>Crofts</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Hereford</HI> was made Dean in his room. <HI>Crofts</HI> was a warm devout man, but of no di&s;cretion in his con|duct: So he lo&s;t ground quickly. He u&s;ed much freedom with the King; but it was in the wrong place, not in private, but in the pulpit.</P>
<P>The King was highly offended at the behaviour of mo&s;t of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King was much offended with the Bi|&s;hops.</NOTE> the Bi&s;hops: And he took occa&s;ion to vent it at the Council|board. Upon the complaints that were made of &s;ome di&s;orders, and of &s;ome Conventicles, he &s;aid, the Clergy were chiefly to blame for the&s;e di&s;orders; for if they had lived well, and had gone about their pari&s;hes, and taken pains to convince the Non-conformi&s;ts, the Nation might have been by that time well &s;ettled. But they thought of nothing, but to get good be|nefices, and to keep a good table. This I read in a letter that Sir <HI>Robert Murray</HI> writ down to <HI>Scotland:</HI> And it agrees with a conver&s;ation that the King was plea&s;ed to have with my &s;elf once, when I was alone with him in his clo&s;et. While we were talk|ing of the ill &s;tate the Church was in, I was &s;truck to hear a Prince of his cour&s;e of life &s;o much di&s;gu&s;ted at the ambition, covetou&s;ne&s;s, and the &s;candals of the Clergy. He &s;aid, if the Clergy had done their part, it had been an ea&s;y thing to run down the Non-conformi&s;ts: But he added, they will do nothing, and will have me do every thing: And mo&s;t of them do wor&s;e than if they did nothing. He told me, he had a Chaplain, that was a very hone&s;t man, but a very great blockhead, to whom he had given a living in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> that was full of that &s;ort of people: He had gone about among them from hou&s;e to hou&s;e; tho' he could not imagine what he could &s;ay to them; for he &s;aid he was a very &s;illy fellow: But that, he believed, his non&s;en&s;e &s;uited their non&s;en&s;e, for he had brought them all to
<PB N="259" REF="274">
Church: And, in reward of his diligence, he had given him a Bi&s;hoprick in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bridgman</HI> and <HI>Wilkins</HI> &s;et on foot a treaty, for a comprehen|&s;ion <NOTE PLACE="marg">1668. A treaty for a compre|hen&s;ion of the Presby|terians.</NOTE> of &s;uch of the Di&s;&s;enters as could be brought into the com|munion of the Church, and a toleration of the re&s;t. <HI>Hale,</HI> the the Chief Ju&s;tice, concurred with them in the de&s;ign. <HI>Tillot&s;on, Stillingfleet,</HI> and <HI>Burton</HI> joined al&s;o in it. <HI>Bates, Manton,</HI> and <HI>Baxter</HI> were called for on the &s;ide of the Pre&s;byterians. And a project was prepared, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of tho&s;e things that the King had promi&s;ed by his declaration in the year 1660. Only in the point of re-ordination this temper was propo&s;ed, that tho&s;e who had Pre&s;byterian ordination &s;hould be received to &s;erve in the Church by an impo&s;ition of hands, accompanied with words which imported, that the per&s;on &s;o ordained was recei|ved to &s;erve as a Mini&s;ter in the Church of <HI>England.</HI> This treaty became a common &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e. All Lord <HI>Cla|rendon</HI>'s friends cried out, that the Church was undermined and betrayed: It was &s;aid, the cau&s;e of the Church was given up, if we yielded any of tho&s;e points, about which there had been &s;o much di&s;puting: If the Sectaries were humble and mode&s;t, and would tell what would &s;atisfy them, there might be &s;ome colour for granting &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions: But it was unworthy of the Church to go and court, or treat with enemies; when there was no rea&s;on to think, that after we had departed from our grounds, which was to confe&s;s we had been in the wrong, that we &s;hould gain much by it, unle&s;s it was to bring &s;corn and contempt on our &s;elves. On the other hand it was &s;aid, the Non-conformi&s;ts could not legally meet together to offer any &s;chemes in the name of their party: It was well enough known, what they had always excepted to, and what would probably bring over mo&s;t of the Pre&s;byterians: Such a yielding in &s;ome le&s;&s;er matters would be no reproach, but an honour to the Church; that, how much &s;o|ever &s;he might be &s;uperiour both in point of argument and of power, &s;he would yet of her own accord, and for peace &s;ake, yield a great deal in matters indifferent: The Apo&s;tles complying with many of the ob&s;ervances of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the offers that the Church of <HI>Africk</HI> made to the <HI>Donati&s;ts,</HI> were much in&s;i&s;ted on: The fears of Popery, and the progre&s;s that Athei&s;m was making, did alarm good and wi&s;e men: And they thought, eve|ry thing that could be done without &s;in ought to be done to|wards the healing our divi&s;ions. Many books were upon that account writ, to expo&s;e the Pre&s;byterians, as men of fal&s;e noti|ons in religion, which led to Antinomiani&s;m, and which would
<PB N="260" REF="275">
&s;oon carry them into a di&s;&s;olution of morals, under a pretence of being ju&s;tifyed by faith only, without works. The three vo|lumes of the Friendly Debate, tho' writ by a very good man, and with a good intent, had an ill effect in &s;harpening peoples &s;pi|rits too much again&s;t them. But the mo&s;t virulent of all that writ again&s;t the &s;ects was <HI>Parker,</HI> afterwards made Bi&s;hop of <HI>Oxford</HI> by King <HI>James;</HI> who was full of &s;atyrical vivacity, and was con&s;iderably learned; but was a man of no judgment, and of as little vertue, and as to religion rather impious. After he had for &s;ome years entertained the Nation with &s;everal virulent books, writ with much life, he was attacked by the livelie&s;t droll of the age, who writ in a burle&s;que &s;train, but with &s;o peculiar and &s;o entertaining a conduct, that, from the King down to the trade&s;man, his books were read with great plea&s;ure. That not only humbled <HI>Parker,</HI> but the whole party: For the author of the Rehear&s;al Tran&s;pro&s;ed had all the men of wit (or, as the <HI>French</HI> phra&s;e it, all the <HI>Laughers)</HI> on his &s;ide. But what advan|tages &s;oever the men of comprehen&s;ion might have in any other re&s;pect, the majority of the Hou&s;e of Commons was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed again&s;t them, that when it was known in a &s;ucceeding &s;e&s;|&s;ion, that a bill was ready to be offered to the Hou&s;e for that end, a very extraordinary vote pa&s;s'd, that no bill to that pur|po&s;e &s;hould be received.</P>
<P>An Act pa&s;s'd in this &s;e&s;&s;ion for rebuilding the City of <HI>London,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of <HI>London</HI> re|built.</NOTE> which gave Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Hale</HI> a great reputation: For it was drawn with &s;o true a judgment, and &s;o great fore&s;ight, that the whole City was rai&s;ed out of its a&s;hes without any &s;uits of law; which, if that bill had not prevented them, would have brought a &s;econd charge on the City, not much le&s;s than the fire it &s;elf had been. And upon that, to the amazement of all <HI>Europe, London</HI> was in four years time rebuilt, with &s;o much beauty and magnificence, that we who &s;aw it in both &s;tates, before and after the fire, cannot reflect on it without wondring where the wealth could be found to bear &s;o va&s;t a lo&s;s as was made by the fire, and &s;o prodigious an expence as was laid out in the rebuilding it. This did demon&s;trate, that the intrin&s;ick wealth of the Nation was very high, when it could an&s;wer &s;uch a dead charge.</P>
<P>I return to the intrigues of the Court. Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s ene|mies <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;igns for putting a|way the Queen.</NOTE> thought they were not &s;afe, as long as the Duke had &s;o much credit with the King, and the Duche&s;s had &s;o much pow|er over him: So they fell on propo&s;itions of a &s;trange nature to ruine them. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> pre&s;&s;ed the King to own a marriage with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s mother: And
<PB N="261" REF="276">
he undertook to get witne&s;&s;es to atte&s;t it. The Duke of <HI>York</HI> told me, in general, that there was much talk about it: But he did not de&s;cend to particulars. The Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> of|fered to begin the matter in the Hou&s;e of Lords. The King would not con&s;ent to this: Yet he put it by in &s;uch a manner, as made them all conclude, he wi&s;hed it might be done, but did not know how to bring it about. The&s;e di&s;cour&s;es were all car|ried to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and got fatally into his head. When the Duke talked of this matter to me in the year &s;even|ty three, I a&s;ked him, if he thought the King had &s;till the &s;ame inclinations? He &s;aid he believed not: He thought, the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> had not &s;pirit enough to think of it: And he com|mended the Duche&s;s of <HI>Monmouth</HI> &s;o highly as to &s;ay to me, that the hopes of a Crown could not work on her to do an un|ju&s;t thing. I thought he gave that matter too much counte|nance, by calling the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> nephew: But he &s;aid, it plea&s;ed the King. When the party &s;aw they could make no|thing of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> they tried next by what methods they could get rid of the Queen; that &s;o the King might marry another wife: For the King had children by &s;o many different creatures, that they hoped for i&s;&s;ue, if he had a wife capable of any. Some thought, the Queen and he were not legally married: But the avowing a marriage, and the living many years in that &s;tate, did certainly &s;upply any defect in point of form. Others pretended, &s;he was barren from a na|tural cau&s;e, and that &s;eemed equivalent to impotence in men. But the King often &s;aid, he was &s;ure &s;he had once mi&s;carried. This, tho' not overthrown by &s;uch an evidence, could never be proved; unle&s;s the having no children was to be concluded a barrenne&s;s: And the di&s;&s;olving a marriage on &s;uch an account could neither be ju&s;tifyed in law nor con&s;cience. Other &s;tories were given out of the Queen's per&s;on, which were fal&s;e: For I &s;aw in a letter under the King's own hand that the marriage was con&s;ummated. Others talked of polygamy: And officious per&s;ons were ready to thru&s;t them&s;elves into any thing that could contribute to their advancement. Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> and Sir <HI>Ro|bert Murray</HI> a&s;ked my opinion of the&s;e things. I &s;aid, I knew &s;peculative people could &s;ay a great deal in the way of argu|ment for polygamy, and divorce: Yet the&s;e things were &s;o de|cried, that they were rejected by all Chri&s;tian &s;ocieties: So that all &s;uch propo&s;itions would throw us into great convul&s;ions; and entail war upon us, if any i&s;&s;ue came from a marriage &s;o grounded.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="277">
An accident happened at that time, that made the di&s;cour&s;ing of tho&s;e matters the common &s;ubject of conver&s;ation. The Lord <HI>Roos,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Rutland,</HI> brought proofs of adultery <NOTE PLACE="marg">A divorce enacted for adultery.</NOTE> again&s;t his wife; and obtained a &s;entence of divorce in the Spiri|tual Court: Which amounting only to a &s;eparation from bed and board, he moved for a bill di&s;&s;olving the bond, and enabling him to marry another wife. The <HI>Duke</HI> and all his party apprehend|ed the con&s;equences of a Parliamentary divorce: So they oppo&s;ed this with great heat: And almo&s;t all the Bi&s;hops were of that &s;ide: Only <HI>Co&s;ins</HI> and <HI>Wilkins,</HI> the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Durham</HI> and <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> were for it. And the King was as earne&s;t in the &s;etting it on, as the Duke was in oppo&s;ing it. The zeal which the two brothers expre&s;&s;ed on that occa&s;ion made all people conclude, that they had a particular concern in the matter. The bill pa&s;s'd: And up|on that precedent &s;ome moved the King, that he would order a bill to be brought in to divorce him from the Queen. This went &s;o far, that a day was agreed on for making the motion in the Hou&s;e of Commons, as Mr. <HI>May</HI> of the privy pur&s;e told me; (who had the greate&s;t and longe&s;t &s;hare in the King's &s;ecret con|fidence of any man in that time; for it was never broke off, tho' often &s;haken, he being in his notions again&s;t every thing that the King was for, both <HI>France,</HI> Popery, and arbitrary govern|ment; but a particular &s;ympathy of temper, and his &s;erving the King in his vices, created a confidence much envied, and often attempted to be broke, but never with any &s;ucce&s;s beyond a &s;hort coldne&s;s:) But he added, when he told me of this de&s;ign, that three days before the motion was to be made, the King called for him, and told him, that matter mu&s;t be let alone, for it would not do. This di&s;turbed him much; for he had engaged him&s;elf far in laying the thing, and in managing tho&s;e who were to undertake the debate.</P>
<P>At this time the Court fell into much extravagance in ma&s;que|rading, both King and Queen, and all the Court, went about <NOTE PLACE="marg">A great di&s;|&s;olution o$ $word$ in $ourt.</NOTE> ma&s;ked, and came into hou&s;es unknown, and danced there with a great deal of wild frolick. In all this people were &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed, that without being on the &s;ecret none could di&s;tingui&s;h them. They were carried about in hackney chairs. Once the Queen's chairmen, not knowing who &s;he was, went from her: So &s;he was alone, and was much di&s;turbed, and came to <HI>Whitehall</HI> in a hackney coach: Some &s;ay it was in a cart. The Duke of <HI>Buck|ingham</HI> propo&s;ed to the King, that he would give him leave to &s;teal her away, and &s;end her to a plantation, where &s;he &s;hould be well and carefully looked to, but never heard of any more: So it &s;hould be given out, that &s;he had de&s;erted: And upon that
<PB N="263" REF="278">
it would fall in with &s;ome principles to carry an act for a divorce, grounded upon the pretence of a wilful de&s;ertion. Sir <HI>Robert Murray</HI> told me, that the King him&s;elf rejected this with hor|rour. He &s;aid, it was a wicked thing to make a poor lady mi&s;e|rable, only becau&s;e &s;he was his wife, and had no children by him, which was no fault of hers. The hints of this broke out: For the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> could conceal nothing. And upon that the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> then Lord <HI>Chamberlain,</HI> told the Queen, it was neither decent, nor &s;afe for her to go about in &s;uch a man|ner as &s;he had done of late: So &s;he gave it over. But at la&s;t all the&s;e &s;chemes &s;ettled in a propo&s;ition, into which the King went; which was to deal with the Queen's confe&s;&s;or, that he might per&s;uade her to leave the world, and to turn religious: Upon which the Parliament would have been ea&s;ily prevailed on to pa&s;s a divorce. This came to be known: But what &s;teps were made in it were never made publick. It was believed, that upon this the Duche&s;s of <HI>York</HI> &s;ent an expre&s;s to <HI>Rome</HI> with the notice of her conver&s;ion; and that orders were &s;ent from <HI>Rome</HI> to all about the Queen to per&s;uade her again&s;t &s;uch a propo&s;ition, if any &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t it to her. She her&s;elf had no mind to be a Nun: And the Duche&s;s was afraid of &s;eeing another Queen: And the mi&s;tri&s;s created at that time Duche&s;s of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> knew that &s;he mu&s;t be the fir&s;t &s;acrifice to a beloved Queen: And &s;he reconciled her &s;elf upon this to the Duche&s;s of <HI>York.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> upon that broke with her, and &s;tudied to take the King from her by new amours: And becau&s;e he thought a gaity of hu|mour would take much with the King, he engaged him to en|tertain two players one after another, <HI>Davies</HI> and <HI>Gwin.</HI> The fir&s;t did not keep her hold long: But <HI>Gwin,</HI> the indi&s;creete&s;t and wilde&s;t creature that ever was in a Court, continued to the end of the King's life in great favour, and was maintained at a va&s;t ex|pence. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> told me, that when &s;he was fir&s;t brought to the King, &s;he a&s;ked only five hundred pounds a year: And the King refu&s;ed it. But when he told me this, a|bout four years after, he &s;aid, &s;he had got of the King above &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds. She acted all per&s;ons in &s;o lively a man|ner, and was &s;uch a con&s;tant diver&s;ion to the King, that even a new mi&s;tri&s;s could not drive her away. But after all he never treated her with the decencies of a mi&s;tri&s;s. The King had ano|ther mi&s;tri&s;s, that was managed by Lord <HI>Sha$tsbu$y,</HI> who was the daughter of a Clergyman, <HI>Roberts;</HI> in whom her fir&s;t edu|cation had &s;o deep a root, that, tho' &s;he fell into many &s;can|dalous di&s;orders, with very di&s;mal adventures in them all, yet a principle of religion was &s;o deep laid in her, that, tho' it did
<PB N="264" REF="279">
not re&s;train her, yet it kept alive in her &s;uch a con&s;tant horrour at &s;in, that &s;he was never ea&s;y in an ill cour&s;e, and died with a great &s;en&s;e of her former ill life. I was often with her the la&s;t three months of her life. The Duche&s;s of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> finding that &s;he had lo&s;t the King, abandoned her &s;elf to great di&s;orders: One of which, by the artifice of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> was di&s;covered by the King in per&s;on, the party concerned leaping out of the window. She al&s;o &s;poke of the King to all people in &s;uch a manner, as brought him under much contempt. But he <NOTE PLACE="marg">Many libels writ by the be&s;t wits of that time.</NOTE> &s;eemed in&s;en&s;ible: And tho' libels of all &s;orts had then a very free cour&s;e, yet he was never di&s;turbed at it.</P>
<P>The three mo&s;t eminent wits of that time, on whom all the lively libels were fa&s;tened, were the Earls of <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI> and <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and Sir <HI>Charles Sidley.</HI> Lord <HI>Dor&s;et</HI> was a generous good natured Man. He was &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed with phlegm, that till he was a little hea|ted with wine he &s;carce ever &s;poke: But he was upon that exal|tation a very lively man. Never was &s;o much ill nature in a pen as in his, joined with &s;o much good nature as was in him&s;elf, even to exce&s;s; for he was again&s;t all puni&s;hing, even of male|factors. He was bountiful, even to run him&s;elf into difficulties: And charitable to a fault; for he commonly gave all he had a|bout him, when he met an object that moved him. But he was &s;o lazy, that, tho' the King &s;eemed to court him to be a favou|rite, he would not give him&s;elf the trouble that belonged to that po&s;t. He hated the Court, and de&s;pi&s;ed the King, when he &s;aw he was neither generous, nor tender hearted. <HI>Wilmot</HI> Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> was naturally mode&s;t, till the Court corrupted him. His wit had in it a peculiar brightne&s;s, to which none could ever ar|rive. He gave him&s;elf up to all &s;orts of extravagance, and to the wilde&s;t frolicks that a wanton wit could devi&s;e. He would have gone about the &s;treets as a beggar, and made love as a porter. He &s;et up a &s;tage as an <HI>Italian</HI> mountebanck. He was for &s;ome years always drunk, and was ever doing &s;ome mi&s;chief. The King loved his company for the diver&s;ion it afforded, better than his per&s;on: And there was no love lo&s;t between them. He took his revenges in many libels. He found out a footman that knew all the Court, and he furni&s;hed him with a red coat and a mu&s;ket as a centinel, and kept him all the winter long every night at the doors of &s;uch ladies, as he believed might be in in|trigues. In the Court a centinel is little minded, and is believed to be po&s;ted by a captain of the Guards to hinder a combat: So this man &s;aw who walked about, and vi&s;ited at forbidden hours. By this means Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> made many di&s;coveries. And when he was well furni&s;hed with materials, he u&s;ed to
<PB N="265" REF="280">
retire into the country for a month or two to write libels: Once being drunk he intended to give the King a libel that he had writ on &s;ome ladies: But by a mi&s;take he gave him one writ|ten on him&s;elf. He fell into an ill habit of body: And in &s;e|veral fits of &s;ickne&s;s he had deep remor&s;es; for he was guilty both of much impiety, and of great immoralities. But as he re|covered he threw the&s;e off, and turned again to his former ill cour&s;es. In the la&s;t year of his life I was much with him, and have writ a book of what pa&s;s'd between him and me. I do verily believe, he was then &s;o entirely changed, that, if he had recovered, he would have made good all his re&s;olutions. <HI>Sidly</HI> had a more &s;udden and copious wit, which furni&s;hed a perpetual run of di&s;cour&s;e: But he was not &s;o correct as Lord <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI> nor &s;o &s;parkling as Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> loved to have the&s;e much about him: And he gave him&s;elf up to a mon|&s;trous cour&s;e of &s;tudied immoralities of the wor&s;t kinds: He was &s;o full of mercury, that he could not fix long in any friend&s;hip, or to any de&s;ign. <HI>Bennet,</HI> now made Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> and he fell out: <HI>Bennet</HI> was all cunning and artifice, and &s;o could not hold long with him, who was &s;o open that he di&s;clo&s;ed every thing. Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> was engaged in a great intimacy with <HI>Clifford, Litletoun,</HI> and <HI>Duncomb.</HI> I have already given &s;ome account of the two fir&s;t. <HI>Duncomb</HI> was a judicious man, but very haughty, and apt to rai&s;e enemies again&s;t him&s;elf: He was an able Parliament man: But could not go into all the de|&s;igns of the Court; for he had a &s;en&s;e of religion, and a zeal for the liberty of his country. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s chief friends were the Earls of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> and <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> but above all Sir <HI>Thomas Osborn,</HI> rai&s;ed afterwards to be Lord Trea&s;urer, and Earl of <HI>Danby,</HI> and &s;ince made Duke of <HI>Leeds</HI> by the late King.</P>
<P>The King took Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> from the Duke, and put <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI>'s character.</NOTE> him in the Trea&s;ury. He was in a fair way to be the chief Mi|ni&s;ter, and de&s;erved it more than all the re&s;t did. But he was too hone&s;t to engage in the de&s;igns into which the Court was re&s;olv|ed to go, as &s;oon as it had recovered a little reputation; which was &s;unk very low by the ill management of the <HI>Dutch</HI> war, and the &s;qandring away of the money given for it. He was a man of the fine&s;t and the be&s;t temper that belonged to the Court. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and he fell out, I know not for what rea&s;on: And a challenge pa&s;s'd between them, upon which <HI>Co|ventry</HI> was forbid the Court. And he upon that &s;eemed to retire very willingly: And he was become a very religious man when I knew him. He was offered after that the be&s;t po&s;ts in the Court, oftner than once: But he would never engage again. He &s;aw
<PB N="266" REF="281">
what was at bottom, and was re&s;olved not to go through with it; and &s;o continued to his death in a retired cour&s;e of life.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> continued &s;till in the Government of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go|vernment of <HI>Ireland</HI> changed.</NOTE> <HI>Ireland,</HI> tho' &s;everal intere&s;ts joined together again&s;t him. The Earls of <HI>Orrery</HI> and <HI>Ranelagh</HI> on the one hand, and <HI>Talbot</HI> on the other. Lord <HI>Orrery</HI> loved to appear in bu&s;ine&s;s; but dealt &s;o much underhand, that he had not much credit with any &s;ide. Lord <HI>Ranelagh</HI> was a young man of great parts, and as great vices: He had a plea&s;antne&s;s in his conver&s;ation that took much with the King, and had a great dexterity in bu&s;ine&s;s. Many complaints were &s;ecretly brought again&s;t the Duke of <HI>Ormond.</HI> The King loved him: And he accommodated him&s;elf much to the King's humour. Yet the King was, with much difficulty, prevailed on to put an end to his government of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and to put Lord <HI>Roberts,</HI> afterwards made Earl of <HI>Radnor,</HI> in his place; who was a moro&s;e man, believed to be &s;everely ju&s;t, and as wi&s;e as a cynical humour could allow him to be. The man|ner of removing the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> will give a particular cha|racter of the King's temper. He &s;ent Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> to him for his commi&s;&s;ion. The Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> &s;aid, he had recei|ved it from the King's own hands, and he would go and deli|ver it to him. When he carried it to the King, the King de|nied he had &s;ent him any &s;uch me&s;&s;age. Two days after that Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> was &s;ent again with the &s;ame me&s;&s;age: And he had the &s;ame an&s;wer: And the King di&s;owned it again to the Duke. So the King declared in the Privy Council the change of the Government of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and made <HI>Roberts</HI> Lord Lieutenant. And it flew abroad as a piece of news. The Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> hearing that, came to the King in great wrath, to expo&s;tulate upon it. But the King denied the whole thing, and &s;ent him away: But he &s;ent for <HI>Fitzpatrick,</HI> who had married his &s;i&s;ter, and who told me the whole &s;tory, and &s;ent him to the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> to tell him, the King had denied the matter tho' it was true, for he ob&s;erved he was in &s;uch a heat, that he was afraid he might have &s;aid indecent things: And he was re&s;olved not to fall out with him: For, tho' his affairs made it nece&s;&s;ary to change the Government of <HI>Ireland,</HI> yet he would &s;till be kind to him, and continue him Lord <HI>Steward.</HI> Lord <HI>Radnor</HI> did not con|tinue long in <HI>Ireland:</HI> He was cynical in his whole admini&s;tration, and unea&s;y to the King in every thing: And in one of his peevi&s;h humours he writ to the King, that he had but one thing to a&s;k of him, which if it might be granted, he would never a&s;k another, and that was to be di&s;charged of his employment. The Lord <HI>Berk|ley</HI> &s;ucceeded him, who was brother to the Lord <HI>Fitzharding,</HI> and
<PB N="267" REF="282">
from &s;mall beginnings had ri&s;en up to the greate&s;t po&s;t a &s;ubject was capable of. In the war he was Governour of <HI>Exeter</HI> for the King, and one of his Generals. He was named by him Governour to the Duke of <HI>York.</HI> He was now made Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and afterwards &s;ent Amba&s;&s;adour to <HI>France,</HI> and Plenipotentiary to <HI>Nimeguen.</HI> He was a man in whom it ap|peared with how little true judgment Courts di&s;tribute favours and honours. He had a po&s;itive way of undertaking and determining in every thing, but was a very weak man, and not incorrupt.</P>
<P>The Court delivered it &s;elf up to vice. And the Hou&s;e of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Com|mittee of <HI>Brook-hou&s;e.</HI></NOTE> Commons lo&s;t all re&s;pect in the Nation; for they gave &s;till all the money that was a&s;ked. Yet tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the Court carried one great point, that a Committee &s;hould be named to examine the accounts of the money that was given during the <HI>Dutch</HI> war. It was carried, that they &s;hould be all men out of the Hou&s;e. Lord <HI>Brereton</HI> was the chief of them, and had the chair. He was a philo&s;ophical man, and was all his life long in &s;earch of the philo&s;ophers &s;tone, by which he neglected his own affairs; but was a man of great integrity, and was not to be gained by the flatteries, hopes, or threatnings of the Court. Sir <HI>William Turner</HI> was another of the Committee, who had been Lord Major of <HI>London</HI> the former year, under who&s;e wi&s;e and ju&s;t admini&s;tration the rebuilding of the City advanced &s;o fa&s;t, that he would have been cho&s;en Lord Major for the en|&s;uing year, if he had not declined it. <HI>Pierpoint</HI> was likewi&s;e of this Committee: So was Sir <HI>James Langham,</HI> a very weak man, famed only for his readine&s;s of &s;peaking florid <HI>Latin,</HI> which he had attained to a degree beyond any man of the age; but his &s;tyle was too poetical, and full of Epithets and Figures.</P>

He let his wit run much on matters of religion: So that he pa&s;&s;ed for a bold and determined Athei&s;t; tho' he often prote&s;ted to me, he was not one; and &s;aid, he believed there was not one in the world: He confe&s;&s;ed, he could not &s;wallow down every thing that di|vines impo&s;ed on the world: He was a Chri&s;tian in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: He believed as much as he could, and he hoped that God would not lay it to his charge, if he could not di&s;ge&s;t iron, as an o&s;trich did, nor take into his belief things that mu&s;t bur&s;t him: If he had any &s;cruples, they were not &s;ought for, nor cheri&s;hed by him; for he never read an athei&s;tical book. In a $it of &s;ick|ne&s;s, I knew him very much touched with a &s;en&s;e of religion.
<PB N="268" REF="283">
I was then often with him. He &s;eemed full of good purpo&s;es: But they went off with his &s;ickne&s;s. He was always talking of morality and friend&s;hip. He was punctual in all payments, and ju&s;t in all his private dealings. But, with relation to the publick, he went backwards and forwards, and changed &s;ides &s;o often, that in conclu&s;ion no &s;ide tru&s;ted him. He &s;eemed full of Com|mon-wealth notions: Yet he went into the wor&s;t part of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s reign. The liveline&s;s of his imagination was always too hard for his judgment. A &s;evere je&s;t was preferred by him to all arguments what&s;oever. And he was endle&s;s in con&s;ultati|ons: For when after much di&s;cour&s;e a point was &s;ettled, if he could find a new je&s;t, to make even that which was &s;ugge&s;ted by him&s;elf &s;eem ridiculous, he could not hold, but would &s;tudy to rai&s;e the credit of his wit, tho' it made others call his judg|ment in que&s;tion. When he talked to me as a philo&s;opher of his contempt of the world, I a&s;ked him, what he meant by get|ting &s;o many new titles, which I call'd the hanging him&s;elf about with bells and tin&s;el. He had no other excu&s;e for it, but this, that, &s;ince the world were &s;uch fools as to value tho&s;e matters, a man mu&s;t be a fool for company: He con&s;idered them but as rattles: Yet rattles plea&s;e children: So the&s;e might be of u&s;e to his family. His heart was much &s;et on rai&s;ing his family. But, tho' he made a va&s;t e&s;tate for them, he buried two of his &s;ons him&s;elf, and almo&s;t all his grandchildren. The &s;on that &s;urvi|ved was an hone&s;t man, but far inferior to him. I do not re|member who be&s;ides the&s;e were of that Committee, which becau&s;e it &s;atein <HI>Brook-hou&s;e,</HI> was called by the name of that hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Court was much troubled to &s;ee an enquiry of this kind &s;et on foot. It was &s;aid, the King was ba&s;ely treated, when all <NOTE PLACE="marg">1669. Many Parli|ament men gained by the Court.</NOTE> his expence was to be looked into. On the other hand it was an&s;wered, that the Parliament did not look into his revenue, but only to the di&s;tribution of that trea&s;ure that was tru&s;ted to him for carrying on the war. I was told, that, after all the mo&s;t &s;hameful items that could be put into an account, there was none offered for about 800000 <HI>l.</HI> But I was not then in <HI>England:</HI> So I was very imperfectly informed as to this mat|ter. The chief men that promoted this were taken off, (as the word then was for corrupting members,) in which the Court made &s;o great a progre&s;s, that it was thought the King could never have been prevailed on to part with a Parliament &s;o much practi&s;ed on, and where every man's price was known; for as a man ro&s;e in his credit in the Hou&s;e, he rai&s;ed his price, and ex|pected to be treated accordingly. In all this enquiry the care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s and luxury of the Court came to be &s;o much expo&s;ed,
<PB N="269" REF="284">
that the King's &s;pirit was much &s;harpened upon it. All the flatterers about him magnified foreign governments, where the Princes were ab&s;olute, that in <HI>France</HI> more particularly. Many to plea&s;e him &s;aid, it was a very ea&s;y thing to &s;hake off the re&s;traints of law, if the King would but &s;et about it. The Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> was elective, and &s;ubject to a Senate, and yet was in one day, without any vi&s;ible force, changed to be both hereditary and ab&s;olute, no rebellion nor convul&s;ion of &s;tate following on it. The King loved the project in gene|ral; but would not give him&s;elf the trouble of laying or mana|ging it. And therefore, till his affairs were made ea&s;ier, and the project grew clearer, he re&s;olved to keep all things clo&s;e within him&s;elf; and went on in the common maxim, to balance party again&s;t party, and by doing popular things to get money of his Parliament, under the pretence of &s;upporting the Triple Alliance. So money-bills pa&s;&s;ed ea&s;ily in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons: Which by a &s;trange rever&s;e came to be oppo&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Lords; who began to complain, that the money-bills came up &s;o thick, that it was &s;aid, there was no end of their giving. <HI>End</HI> &s;ignifying purpo&s;e, as well as a mea&s;ure, this pa&s;s'd as a &s;evere je&s;t at that time. Sir <HI>John Coventry</HI> made a gro&s;s re|flection on the King's amours. He was one of tho&s;e who &s;trug|gled much again&s;t the giving money. The common method is: After tho&s;e who oppo&s;e &s;uch bills fail in the main vote, the next thing they endeavour is, to lay the money on funds that will be unacceptable, and will prove deficient. So the&s;e men propo&s;ed the laying a tax on the Play-hou&s;es, which in &s;o di&s;&s;olute a time were become ne&s;ts of pro&s;titution. And the &s;tage was defil|ed beyond all example, <HI>Dryden,</HI> the great ma&s;ter of Dramatick Poe&s;y, being a mon&s;ter of immode&s;ty, and of impurity of all &s;orts. This was oppo&s;ed by the Court: It was &s;aid, the Players were the King's &s;ervants, and a part of his plea&s;ure. <HI>Coventry</HI> a&s;ked, whether did the King's plea&s;ure lie among the men, or the wo|men that acted? This was carried with great indignation to the Court. It was &s;aid, this was the fir&s;t time that the King was per&s;onally reflected on: If it was pa&s;&s;ed over, more of the &s;ame kind would follow; and it would grow a fa&s;hion to talk &s;o: It was therefore fit to take &s;uch &s;evere notice of this, that no bo|dy &s;hould dare to talk at that rate for the future. The Duke of <HI>York</HI> told me, he &s;aid all he could to the King to divert him from the re&s;olution he took; which was to &s;end &s;ome of the Guards, and watch in the &s;treets where Sir <HI>John</HI> lodged, and leave a mark upon him. <HI>Sands</HI> and <HI>Obrian,</HI> and &s;ome others, went thither: And as <HI>Coventry</HI> was going home, they drew about
<PB N="270" REF="285">
him. He &s;tood up to the wall, and &s;natched the flambeau out of his &s;ervant's hands: And with that in the one hand, and his &s;word in the other, he defended him&s;elf &s;o well, that he got more credit by it than by all the actions of his life. He woun|ed <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coventry</HI>'s no&s;e was cut.</NOTE> &s;ome of them; but was &s;oon di&s;armed: And then they cut his no&s;e to the bone, to teach him to remember what re&s;pect he owed to the King: And &s;o they left him, and went back to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s, where <HI>Obrian</HI>'s arm was dre&s;&s;ed. That matter was executed by orders from the Duke of <HI>Monmouth:</HI> For which he was &s;everely cen&s;ured, becau&s;e he lived then in profe&s;|&s;ions of friend&s;hip with <HI>Coventry;</HI> &s;o that his &s;ubjection to the King was not thought an excu&s;e for directing &s;o vile an attempt on his friend, without &s;ending him &s;ecret notice of what was de&s;igned. <HI>Coventry</HI> had his no&s;e &s;o well needled up, that the &s;car was &s;carce to be di&s;cerned. This put the Hou&s;e of Com|mons in a furious uproar. They pa&s;&s;ed a bill of bani&s;hment again&s;t the actors of it; and put a clau&s;e in it, that it &s;hould not be in the King's power to pardon them. This gave great advantages to all tho&s;e that oppo&s;ed the Court: And was often remembred, and much improved, by all the angry men of this time. The names of the Court and Country party, which till now had &s;eemed to be forgotten, were again revived.</P>
<P>When the City was pretty well rebuilt, they began to take <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new pro|&s;ecution of Conventi|cles</NOTE> care of the Churches, which had lain in a&s;hes &s;ome years. And in that time Conventicles abounded in all the parts of the City. It was thought hard to hinder men from wor&s;hipping God any way as they could, when there were no Churches, nor Mini&s;ters to look after them. But they began to rai&s;e Churches of boards, till the publick allowance &s;hould be rai&s;ed towards the building the Churches. The&s;e they called Tabernacles: And they fitted them up with pews and galleries as Churches. So now an Act was propo&s;ed, reviving the former Act again&s;t Conventicles, with &s;ome new clau&s;es in it. One was very extraordinary, that if any doubt &s;hould ari&s;e concerning the meaning of any part of this Act, it was to be determined in the &s;en&s;e that was the mo&s;t contrary to Conventicles, it being the intention of the Hou&s;e to repre&s;s them in the mo&s;t effectual manner po&s;&s;ible. The other was, the laying a heavy fine on &s;uch Ju&s;tices of the Peace, as &s;hould not execute the law, when informations were brought them. Upon this many, who would not be the in&s;truments of &s;uch &s;everities, left the bench, and would &s;it there no longer. This Act was executed in the City very &s;everely in <HI>Starling</HI>'s Ma|joralty; and put things in &s;uch di&s;order, that many of the trad|ing men of the City began to talk of removing with their &s;tocks
<PB N="271" REF="286">
over to <HI>Holland.</HI> But the King ordered a &s;top to be put to far|ther &s;everities. Many of the &s;ects either di&s;continued their meet|ings, or held them very &s;ecretly with &s;mall numbers, and not in hours of publick wor&s;hip. Yet informers were encouraged, and were every where at work. The behaviour of the Qua|kers was more particular, and had &s;omething in it that looked bold. They met at the &s;ame place, and at the &s;ame hour as before. And when they were &s;eized, none of them would go out of the way: They went all together to pri&s;on: They &s;taid there till they were di&s;mi&s;s'd; for they would not petition to be &s;et at liberty, nor would they pay their fines &s;et on them, nor &s;o much as the jayl fees, calling the&s;e the wages of unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s. And as &s;oon as they were let out, they went to their meeting hou&s;es again: And, when they found the&s;e were &s;hut up by order, they held their meetings on the &s;treets, before the doors of tho&s;e hou&s;es. They &s;aid, they would not di&s;own, or be a&s;hamed of their meeting together to wor&s;hip God: But in imitation of <HI>Daniel</HI> they would do it the more publickly, becau&s;e they were forbidden the doing it. Some called this ob&s;tinacy, while others called it firmne&s;s. But by it they carried their point: For the Government grew weary of dealing with &s;o much per|ver&s;ene&s;s, and &s;o began with letting them alone.</P>
<P>The King had by this time got all the money that he ex|pected <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King went com|monly to the Hou&s;e of Lords.</NOTE> from the Hou&s;e of Commons, and that after great prac|tice on both Lords and Commons. Many bones of contention were thrown in, to create differences between the two Hou&s;es, to try if by both Hou&s;es in&s;i&s;ting on them the money bills might fall. But, to prevent all trouble from the Lords, the King was advi&s;ed to go, and be pre&s;ent at all their debates. Lord <HI>Lau|derdale</HI> valued him&s;elf to me on this advice, which he &s;aid he gave. At fir&s;t the King &s;at decently on the throne, tho' even that was a great re&s;traint on the freedom of debate; which had &s;ome effect for a while: Tho' afterwards many of the Lords &s;eemed to &s;peak with the more boldne&s;s, becau&s;e, they &s;aid, one heard it to whom they had no other acce&s;s but in that place; and they took the more liberty, becau&s;e what they had &s;aid could not be reported wrong. The King, who was often weary of time, and did not know how to get round the day, liked the going to the Hou&s;e, as a plea&s;ant diver&s;ion. So he went con|&s;tantly. And he quickly left the throne, and &s;tood by the fire; which drew a croud about him, that broke all the decency of that Hou&s;e: For before that time every Lord &s;at regularly in his place: But the King's coming broke the order of their &s;it|ting as became Senators. The King's going thither had a much
<PB N="272" REF="287">
wor&s;e effect: For he became a common &s;olicitor, not only in publick affairs, but even in private matters of ju&s;tice. He would in a very little time have gone round the Hou&s;e, and &s;poke to every man that he thought worth &s;peaking to. And he was apt to do that upon the &s;olicitation of any of the Ladies in favour, or of any that had credit with them. He knew well on whom he could prevail: So being once in a matter of ju&s;tice de&s;ired to &s;peak to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Hollis,</HI> he &s;aid, they were &s;tiff and &s;ullen men: But when he was next de&s;ired to &s;olicit two others, he undertook to do it; and &s;aid, they are men of no con&s;cience, &s;o I will take the government of their con&s;cience into my own hands. Yet when any of the Lords told him plainly, that they could not vote as he de&s;ired, he &s;eemed to take it well from them. When the Act again&s;t Con|venticles was debated in that Hou&s;e, <HI>Wilkins</HI> argued long again&s;t it. The King was much for having it pa&s;s, not that he intend|ed to execute it, but he was glad to have that body of men at mercy, and to force them to concur in the de&s;ign for a general toleration. He &s;poke to <HI>Wilkins</HI> not to oppo&s;e it. He an&s;wer|ed, he thought it an ill thing both in con&s;cience and policy: Therefore, both as he was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man, and a Bi&s;hop, he was bound to oppo&s;e it. The King then de&s;ired him not to come to the Hou&s;e while it depended. He &s;aid, by the law and con&s;titution of <HI>England,</HI> and by his Maje&s;ty's favour, he had a right to debate and vote: And he was neither afraid nor a&s;ham|ed to own his opinion in that matter, and to act pur&s;uant to it. So he went on: And the King was not offended with his free|dom. But tho' he bore with &s;uch a frank refu&s;ing to comply with his de&s;ire, yet if any had made him &s;uch general an&s;wers, as led him to believe they intended to be compliant, and had not in all things done as he expected, he called that a juggling with him; and he was apt to &s;peak hardly of them on that account. No &s;ooner was the King at ea&s;e, and had his fleet put in good ca&s;e, and his &s;tores and magazines well furni&s;hed, than he im|mediately fell to negotiating with <HI>France,</HI> both to ruine <HI>Holland,</HI> and to &s;ubvert the government of <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Brook-hou&s;e</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as the burning his fleet, &s;tuck as deep as any thing could do in his heart. He re&s;olved to revenge the one, and to free him&s;elf from the apprehen&s;ions of the others return|ing upon him: Tho' the Hou&s;e of Commons were &s;o far practi&s;ed on, that the report of <HI>Brook-hou&s;e</HI> was let fall; and that matter was no more in&s;i&s;ted on. Yet he abhorred the precedent, and the di&s;coveries that had been made upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="288">
The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> came over to him in the winter 1669. He was then in the twentieth year of his age: So he came over, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prit$span$ of <HI>Or$span$</HI> came to King.</NOTE> both to &s;ee how the King intended to pay the great debt that he owed him, which had been contracted by his father on his account, and likewi&s;e to try what offices the King would do in order to his advancement to the Stadtholder&s;hip. The King treated him civilly. He a&s;&s;ured him he would pay the debt: But did not lay down any method of doing it: So the&s;e were only good words. He tryed the Prince, as the Prince him&s;elf told me in point of religion: He &s;poke of all the Prote&s;tants as a factious body, broken among them&s;elves ever &s;ince they had broken off from the main body; and wi&s;hed, that he would take more pains, and look into the&s;e things better, and not to be led by his <HI>Dutch</HI> blockheads. The Prince told all this to <HI>Zuyle&s;teyn</HI> his natural uncle. They were both amazed at it; and wonder|ed, how the King could tru&s;t &s;o great a &s;ecret, as his being a Papi&s;t, to &s;o young a per&s;on. The Prince told me, that he never &s;poke of this to any other per&s;on, till after his death: But he carried it always in his own mind, and could not hinder him&s;elf from judging of all the King's intentions after that from the di&s;covery he had then made of his own &s;entiments. Nor did he, upon his not complying with that propo&s;ition, expect any real a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the King, but general interce&s;&s;ions, which &s;ignifyed nothing: And that was all he obtained.</P>
<P>So far have I carried on the thread of the affairs of <HI>England,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The affairs of <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> down from the peace of <HI>Breda</HI> to the year 1670, in which the negotiation with the Court of <HI>France</HI> was &s;et on foot. I am not &s;ure, that every thing is told in ju&s;t order; becau&s;e I was all the while very much retired from the world and from company. But I am confident, I have given a true repre&s;entation of things; &s;ince I had mo&s;t of the&s;e matters from per&s;ons who knew them well, and who were not like to deceive me. But now I return to my own country, where the &s;ame &s;pirit appeared in the admini&s;tration. <NOTE PLACE="marg">A treaty for an accom|modation with the Presbyteri|ans in <HI>Scot|land.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The King was now upon mea&s;ures of moderation and com|prehen&s;ion: So the&s;e were al&s;o pur&s;ued in <HI>Scotland. Leightoun</HI> was the only per&s;on among the Bi&s;hops who declared for the&s;e methods: And he made no &s;tep without talking it over to me. A great many Churches were already vacant. The people fell off entirely from all the Epi&s;copal Clergy in the we&s;tern Coun|ties: And a &s;et of hot, fiery, young teachers went about among them, inflaming them more and more: So it was nece&s;|&s;ary to find a remedy for this. <HI>Leightoun</HI> propo&s;ed, that a trea|ty &s;hould be &s;et on foot in order to the accommodating our dif|ferences, and for changing the laws that had carried the Epi&s;|copal
<PB N="274" REF="289">
authority much higher than any of the Bi&s;hops them|&s;elves put in practice. He &s;aw both Church and State were rent: Religion was like to be lo&s;t: Popery, or rather barbarity, was like to come in upon us: And therefore he propo&s;ed &s;uch a &s;cheme, as he thought might have taken in the &s;obere&s;t men of Pre&s;byterian principles; reckoning that, if the &s;chi&s;m could be once healed, and order be once re&s;tored, it might be ea&s;y to bring things into &s;uch management, that the conce&s;&s;ions then to be offered &s;hould do no great hurt in pre&s;ent, and &s;hould die with that generation. He ob&s;erved the extraordinary conce&s;&s;i|ons made by the <HI>African</HI> Church to the <HI>Donati&s;ts,</HI> who were eve|ry whit as wild and extravagant as our people were: Therefore he went indeed very far in the extenuating the Epi&s;copal autho|rity: But he thought, it would be ea&s;y afterwards to recover what &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to be yielded at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>He propo&s;ed, that the Church &s;hould be governed by the Bi&s;hops and their Clergy, mixing together in the Church Judi|catories; in which the Bi&s;hop &s;hould act only as a pre&s;ident, and be determined by the majority of his Pre&s;byters, both in matters of juri&s;diction and ordination: And that the Pre&s;byterians &s;hould be allowed, when they &s;at down fir&s;t in the&s;e Judicatories, to declare, that their &s;itting under a Bi&s;hop was &s;ubmitted to by them only for peace &s;ake, with a re&s;ervation of their opi|nion with relation to any &s;uch pre&s;idency: And that no negative vote &s;hould be claimed by the Bi&s;hop: That Bi&s;hops &s;hould go to the Churches, in which &s;uch as were to be ordained were to &s;erve, and hear and di&s;cu&s;s any exceptions that were made to them, and ordain them with the concurrence of the Pre&s;byte|ry: That &s;uch as were to be ordained &s;hould have leave to de|clare their opinion, if they thought the Bi&s;hop was only the head of the Pre&s;byters. And he al&s;o propo&s;ed, that there &s;hould be provincial Synods, to &s;it in cour&s;e every third year, or oft|ner, if the King &s;hould &s;ummon them; in which complaints of the Bi&s;hops &s;hould be received; and they &s;hould be cen&s;ured accordingly. The laws that &s;ettled Epi&s;copacy, and the autho|rity of a National Synod, were to be altered according to this &s;cheme. To ju&s;tify, or rather to excu&s;e the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, which le&s;t little more than the name of a Bi&s;hop, he &s;aid, as for their prote&s;tation, it would be little minded, and &s;oon forgotten: The world would &s;ee the union that would be again &s;ettled among us, and the prote&s;tation would lie dead in the books, and die with tho&s;e that made it: As for the negative vote, Bi&s;hops generally managed matters &s;o, that they had no occa&s;ion for it: But, if it &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary, it might be lodged in the
<PB N="275" REF="290">
King's name with &s;ome &s;ecular per&s;on, who &s;hould interpo&s;e as often as the Bi&s;hop &s;aw it was expedient to u&s;e it: And if the pre&s;ent race could be but laid in their graves in peace, all tho&s;e heats would abate, if not quite fall off. He al&s;o thought, it was a much decenter thing, for Bi&s;hops to go upon the place where the Mini&s;ter was to &s;erve, and to ordain after &s;olemn fa&s;ting and prayer, than to huddle it up at their Cathedrals, with no &s;olemnity, and &s;carce with common decency. It &s;eem|ed al&s;o rea&s;onable, that Bi&s;hops &s;hould be liable to cen&s;ure, as well as other people: And that in a fixed Court, which was to con&s;i&s;t of Bi&s;hops, and Deans, and two cho&s;en from every Pre&s;bytery. The liberty offered to &s;uch as were to be ordained, to declare their opinion, was the harde&s;t part of the whole. It looked like the perpetuating a factious and irregular humour. But few would make u&s;e of it. All the Churches in the gift of the King, or of the Bi&s;hops, would go to men of other princi|ples. But tho' &s;ome things of an ill di&s;ge&s;tion were at &s;uch a time admitted, yet, if by the&s;e means the &s;chi&s;m could be once healed, and the Nation again &s;ettled in a peacable &s;tate, the ad|vantage of that would balance all that was lo&s;t by tho&s;e abate|ments that were to be made in the Epi&s;copal authority; which had been rai&s;ed too high, and to correct that was now to be let fall too low, if it were not for the good that was to be hoped for from this Accommodation: For this came to be the word as Comprehen&s;ion was in <HI>England.</HI> He propo&s;ed farther, that a treaty might be &s;et on foot, for bringing the Pre&s;byterians to accept of the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions. The Earl of <HI>Kincardin</HI> was again&s;t all treating with them: They were a trifling &s;ort of di&s;putatious people: They would fall into much warngling, and would &s;ub|divide among them&s;elves: And the young and ignorant men among them, that were accu&s;tomed to popular declamations, would &s;ay, here was a bargain made &s;ell <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Kingdom, and his prerogative. He therefore propo&s;ed, that &s;ince we knew both their principles and their tempers, we ought to carry the conce&s;&s;ions as far as it was either rea&s;onable or expedient, and pa&s;s the&s;e into laws: And then they would &s;ubmit to a &s;ettle|ment that was made, and that could not be helped, more ea&s;i|ly than give a con&s;ent before hand to any thing that &s;eemed to entrench on that which they called the liberty of the Church. <HI>Leightoun</HI> did fully agree with him in this. But Lord <HI>Lauder|dale</HI> would never con&s;ent to that. He &s;aid, a law that did &s;o entirely change the con&s;titution of the Church, when it came to be pa&s;s'd and printed, would be con&s;trued in <HI>England</HI> as a pulling down of Epi&s;copacy; unle&s;s he could have this to &s;ay in excu&s;e
<PB N="276" REF="291">
for it, that the Pre&s;byterians were willing to come under that model. So he &s;aid, &s;ince the load of what was to be done in <HI>Scot|land</HI> would fall heavie&s;t on him, he would not expo&s;e him&s;elf &s;o much, as the pa&s;&s;ing any &s;uch act mu&s;t certainly do, till he knew what effects would follow on it. So we were forced to try how to deal with them in a treaty.</P>
<P>I was &s;ent to propo&s;e this &s;cheme to <HI>Hutchin&s;on,</HI> who was e&s;teemed the learnede&s;t man among them. But I was only to try him, and to talk of it as a notion of my own. He had mar|ried my cou&s;in german; and I had been long acquainted with him. He look'd on it as a project that would never take effect: So he would not give his opinion about it. He &s;aid, when the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions were pa&s;s'd into laws, he would know what he &s;hould think of them: But he was one of many, &s;o he avoided to de|clare him&s;elf. The next thing under con&s;ideration was, how to $i&s;po&s;e of the many vacancies, and how to put a &s;top to Con|venticles. <HI>Leightoun</HI> propo&s;ed, that they &s;hould be kept &s;till va|cant, while the treaty was on foot; and that the Pre&s;byterians &s;hould $word$ how much the Government was in earne&s;t in the de|&s;ign of bringing them to &s;erve in the Church, when &s;o many places were kept open for them.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Tweedale</HI> thought the treaty would run into a <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$.</NOTE> great le$gth, and to many niceties, and would perhaps come to nothing in conclu&s;ion. So he propo&s;ed the granting &s;ome of the outed Mini&s;ters leave to go and &s;erve in tho&s;e pari&s;hes by an Act of the King's indulgence, from whence it came to be called the Indulgence. <HI>Leightoun</HI> was again&s;t this. He thought, nothing would bring on the Pre&s;byterians to a treaty, &s;o much as the hopes of being again &s;uffered to return to their benefices: Whereas, if they were once admitted to them, they would reck|on they had gained their point, and would grow more back|ward. I was de&s;ired to go into the we&s;tern parts, and to give a true account of matters, as I found them there. So I went, as in a vi&s;it to the Duke of <HI>Hamilton;</HI> who&s;e Duche&s;s was a wo|man of great piety, and great parts. She had much credit among them; for &s;he pa&s;s'd for a zealous Pre&s;byterian, tho &s;he prote&s;ted to me, &s;he never entred into the points of controver&s;y, and had no &s;ettled opinion about forms of Government; only &s;he thought their Mini&s;ters were good men, who kept the coun|try in great quiet and order: They were, &s;he &s;aid, blamele&s;s in their lives, devout in their way, and diligent in their labours. The people were all in a phrenzy, and were in no di&s;po&s;ition to any treaty. The &s;u$$ou&s;e&s;t men among them were bu&s;y in Conventicles, inflaming them again&s;t all agreements: So &s;he
<PB N="277" REF="292">
thought, that, if the more moderate Pre&s;byterians were put in vacant Churches, the people would grow tamer, and be taken out of the hands of the mad preachers, that were then mo&s;t in vogue: This would likewi&s;e create a confidence in them: For they were now &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with prejudices, as to believe that all that was propo&s;ed was only an artifice to make them fall out among them|&s;elves, and deceive them at la&s;t. This &s;eemed rea&s;onable: And &s;he got many of the more moderate of them to come to me: And they all talked in the &s;ame &s;train.</P>
<P>A &s;trange accident happened to <HI>Sharp</HI> in <HI>July</HI> 1668, as he <NOTE PLACE="marg">An attempt to murder <HI>Sharp.</HI></NOTE> was going into his coach in full daylight, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Orkney</HI> being with him. A man came up to the coach, and di&s;charged a pi&s;tol at him with a brace of bullets in it, as the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ork|ney</HI> was going up into the coach. He intended to &s;hoot through his cloak at <HI>Sharp,</HI> as he was mounting up: But the bullet &s;tuck in the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Orkney</HI>'s arm, and &s;hattered it &s;o, that, tho' he lived &s;ome years after that, they were forced to open it every year for an exfoliation. <HI>Sharp</HI> was &s;o univer&s;ally hated, that, tho' this was done in full day light, and on the high &s;treet, yet no body offered to &s;eize the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. So he walked off, and went home, and &s;hifted him&s;elf of an odd wig, which he was not accu&s;tomed to wear, and came out, and walked on the &s;treets immediately. But <HI>Sharp</HI> had viewed him &s;o narrowly, that he di&s;covered him afterwards, as &s;hall be mentioned in its proper place. I lived then much out of the world: Yet I thought it decent to go and congratulate on this occa&s;ion. He was much touched with it, and put on a &s;hew of devotion upon it. He &s;aid with a very &s;erious look, my times are wholly in thy hand, O thou God of my life. This was the &s;ingle expre&s;&s;ion $avour|ing of piety, that ever fell from him in all the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between him and me. Proclamations were i&s;&s;ued out with great rewards for di&s;covering the actor: But nothing followed on them. On this occa&s;ion it was thought proper, that he &s;hould be called to Court, and have &s;ome marks of the King's favour put on him. He promi&s;ed to make many good motions: And he talked for a while like a changed man: And went out of his way, as he was going to Court, to vi&s;it me at my par&s;onage hou&s;e, and &s;eemed re&s;olved to turn to other methods. The King, as he had a particular talent that way, when he had a mind to it, treated him with &s;pecial characters of favour and re&s;pect. But he made no propo&s;ition to the King: Only in gene|ral terms he approved of the methods of gentlene&s;s and mode|ration then in vogue.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="293">
When he came back to <HI>Scotland,</HI> he moved in Council that an indulgence might be granted to &s;ome of the Publick Re&s;o|lutioners, with &s;ome rules and re&s;traints; &s;uch as, that they &s;hould <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sharp</HI> pro|po&s;ed the in|dulging &s;ome Mini|&s;ters that did not con|form.</NOTE> not &s;peak, or preach, again&s;t Epi&s;copacy, and that they &s;hould not admit to either of the Sacraments any of the neighbouring pari&s;hes without a de&s;ire from their own Mini&s;ters; and that they &s;hould engage them&s;elves to ob&s;erve the&s;e rules. He knew that his propo&s;ition, for all the &s;hew of moderation that was in it, could have no effect: For the Re&s;olutioners and the Prote&s;tors had laid down their old di&s;putes, and were re&s;olved to come un|der no di&s;crimination on that account; nor would they engage to ob&s;erve any limitations that &s;hould be laid on them. They &s;aid, the Government might lay re&s;traints on them, and puni&s;h them, if they broke thro' them: And they would obey them, or not, at their peril. But they laid down this for a maxim, that they had received a compleat Mini&s;try from <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and that the judicatories of the Church had only power to govern them in the exerci&s;e of their function. If the King &s;hould lay any limitations on them, they might obey the&s;e, as prudence &s;hould direct: But they would not bind them&s;elves up by any engage|ment of their own. <HI>Burnet,</HI> and his Clergy, (for the dioce&s;e of <HI>Gla&s;cow</HI> is above the fourth part of all <HI>Scotland,)</HI> came to <HI>Eden|burgh</HI> full of high complaints, that the Churches were univer|&s;ally for&s;aken, and that Conventicles abounded in every corner of the country. A proclamation was upon that i&s;&s;ued out, in imitation of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Act, &s;etting a fine of 50 <HI>l.</HI> upon every landlord, on who&s;e grounds any Conventicle was held, which he might recover, as he could, of tho&s;e who were at any &s;uch Conventicle. This was plainly again&s;t law; for the Council had no power by their authority to &s;et arbitrary fines. It was pre|tended on the other hand, that the Act of Parliament that had re&s;tored Epi&s;copacy had a clau&s;e in it, recommending the exe|cution of that Act to the Privy Council by all the be&s;t ways they could think of. But the lawyers of the Council-board &s;aid, that in matters of property their power was certainly tied up to the direction of the law: And the clau&s;e mentioned related on|ly to particular methods, but could not be con&s;trued &s;o far, as this proclamation carried the matter. The proclamation went out, but was never executed. It was &s;ent up to <HI>London,</HI> and had a &s;hew of zeal; and &s;o was made u&s;e of by the Earl of <HI>Lau|derdale</HI> to bear down the clamour, that was rai&s;ed again&s;t him and his party in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as if they de&s;igned to pull down Epi&s;|copacy. The model of the county militia was now executed: And above two thou&s;and hor&s;e, and &s;ixteen thou&s;and foot were
<PB N="279" REF="294">
armed, and trained, and ca&s;t into independent regi$ents and troops, who were all to be under &s;uch orders as the Council i&s;|&s;ued out. All this was again&s;t law: For the King had only a power upon an extraordinary occa&s;ion to rai&s;e, and march &s;uch a body of men, as he &s;hould &s;ummon together; and that at his own charge: But the converting this into a &s;tanding militia, which carried with it a &s;tanding charge, was thought a great &s;tretch of prerogative. Yet it was re&s;olved on; tho' great ex|ceptions were made to it by the lawyers, chiefly by Sir <HI>John Ni&s;|bi$,</HI> the King's advocate, a man of great learning, both in law and in many other things, chiefly in the <HI>Greek</HI> learning: He was a per&s;on of great integrity, and always &s;tood firm to the law. The true &s;ecret of this de&s;ign was, that Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was now pre&s;&s;ing to get into the management of the affairs of <HI>England.</HI> And he &s;aw what the Court was aiming at. And he had a mind to make him&s;elf con&s;iderable by this, that he had in his hand a great army, with a magazine of arms, and a &s;tock of money laid up in <HI>Scotland</HI> for any accident that might happen. So all his creatures, and Lady <HI>Dy&s;ert</HI> more than all the re&s;t, had this up in all companies, that none before him ever dreamt how to make <HI>Scotland</HI> con&s;iderable to the King: But now it began to make a great figure. An Army, a Maga|zine, and a Trea&s;ure, were words of a high &s;ound; chiefly now that the Hou&s;e of Commons was like to grow &s;o intractable, that the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> de&s;paired of being able to manage them. He moved the di&s;&s;olving the Parliament, and calling a new one: And thought the Nation would choo&s;e men le&s;s zea|lous for the Church; for the&s;e were all again&s;t him. But the King would not venture on it. He knew the Hou&s;e of Com|mons was either firm to him by their own principles: Or by his management they could be made &s;o: And therefore he would not run the ri&s;k of any new election. He had the Di&s;|&s;enters much in his power, by the &s;evere laws under which they lay at his mercy: But he did not know what influence they might have in elections, and in a new Parliament: The&s;e he knew were in their hearts enemies to prerogative; which he believed they would &s;hew, as &s;oon as they got them&s;elves to be delivered from the laws, that then put them in the King's power.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Tweedale</HI> was then at <HI>London:</HI> And he &s;et on foot a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pro$span$ two $line$</NOTE> propo&s;ition, that came to nothing, but made &s;o much noi&s;e, and was of &s;uch importance, that it de&s;erves to be enlarged on. It was for the union of both Kingdoms. The King liked it, becau&s;e he reckoned, that, at lea&s;t for his time, he &s;hould be
<PB N="280" REF="295">
&s;ure of all the members that &s;hould be &s;ent up from <HI>Scotland.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> went in ea&s;ily to a new thing: And Lord Keeper <HI>Bridgman</HI> was much for it. The Lord <HI>Lauder|dale</HI> pre&s;&s;ed it vehemently: It made it nece&s;&s;ary to hold a Par|liament in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where he intended to be the King's Com|mi&s;&s;ioner. The Earl of <HI>Tweedale</HI> was for it on other accounts, both to &s;ettle the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the militia, and to get &s;ome alterations made in the laws that related to the Church: And he really drove at the union, as a thing which he thought might be brought about. <HI>Scotland,</HI> he &s;aid, was even then under great unea|&s;ine&s;s, tho' the King knew the &s;tate of that Kingdom: But when another King &s;hould reign that knew not <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> (&s;o he expre&s;&s;ed it,) the Nation would be delivered up to favourites, and be de|voured by them: Rich provinces, like tho&s;e that belong|ed to <HI>Spain,</HI> could hold out long under oppre&s;&s;ion: But a poor country would be &s;oon di&s;peopled, if much oppre&s;&s;ed: And if a King of deep de&s;igns again&s;t publick liberty &s;hould care&s;s the <HI>Scots,</HI> he might ea&s;ily engage them; &s;ince a poor country may be &s;uppo&s;ed willing to change their &s;eats, and to break in on a richer one: There was indeed no fear of that at pre&s;ent; for the dotage of the Nation on Pre&s;bytery, and the firmne&s;s with which the Government &s;upported Epi&s;copacy, &s;et them &s;o far from one another, that no engagement of that &s;ort could be attempted: But if a King &s;hould take a dextrous method for putting that out of the way, he might carry <HI>Scotland</HI> to any de&s;ign he thought fit to engage in. Lord <HI>Tweedale</HI> blamed Sir <HI>Francis Bacon</HI> much for laying it down as a maxim, that <HI>Scot|land</HI> was to be reckoned as the third part of the I&s;land, and to be treated accordingly: Whereas he a&s;&s;ured me, <HI>Scotland</HI> for numbers of people was not above a tenth part, and for wealth not above a fortieth part of the I&s;land.</P>
<P>The di&s;cour&s;e of the union was kept up, till it was re&s;olved to &s;ummon a new Parliament in <HI>Scotland.</HI> Then Lord <HI>Lau|derdale</HI> made the King reflect on the old &s;cheme he had laid before him at the Re&s;toration: And he undertook to manage the Parliament &s;o, as to make it an&s;wer that end more effectual|ly than any before him had ever done. This was re&s;olved on in the &s;ummer 1669. I being then at <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and having got the be&s;t information of the &s;tate of the country that I could, wrote a long account of all I had heard to the Lord <HI>Tweedale,</HI> and concluded it with an advice to put &s;ome of the more mo|derate of the Pre&s;byterians into the vacant Churches. Sir <HI>Ro|bert M$span$y</HI> told me, the letter was &s;o well liked, that it was read to the King. Such a letter would have &s;ignifyed nothing,
<PB N="281" REF="296">
if Lord <HI>Tweedale</HI> had not been fixed in the &s;ame notion. He had now a pau&s;ible thing to &s;upport it. So my principles, and zeal for the Church, and I know not what be&s;ides were rai&s;ed to make my advice &s;ignify &s;omewhat. And it was &s;aid, I was the man that went mo&s;t entirely into <HI>Leightoun</HI>'s maxims. So this indi&s;creet letter of mine, &s;ent without communicating it to <HI>Leightoun,</HI> gave the deciding &s;troke. And, as may be ea&s;ily be|lieved, it drew much hatred on me from all that either knew it, or did &s;u&s;pect it.</P>
<P>The King wrote a letter to the Privy Council, ordering them <NOTE PLACE="marg">The K$span$ gave $word$ $word$ $or th$span$ in|dulgence</NOTE> to indulge &s;uch of the Pre&s;byterians as were peaceable and loyal, &s;o far as to &s;uffer them to &s;erve in vacant Churches, tho' they did not &s;ubmit to the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment: And he required them to &s;et them &s;uch rules as might pre&s;erve order and peace, and to look well to the execution of them: And as for &s;uch as could not be provided to Churches at that time, he ordered a pen&s;ion of 20 <HI>l. &s;ter.</HI> a year to be paid every one of them, as long as they lived orderly. Nothing followed on the &s;econd ar|ticle of this letter: The Pre&s;byterians look'd on this, as the King's hire to be &s;ilent, and not to do their duty: And none of them would accept of it. But, as to the fir&s;t part of the letter, on the fir&s;t Council day after it was read, twelve of the Mini|&s;ters were indulged: They had pari&s;hes a&s;&s;igned them: And about thirty more were afterwards indulged in the &s;ame manner: And then a &s;top was put to it for &s;ome time. With the warrants that they had for their Churches, there was a paper of rules likewi&s;e put in their hands. <HI>Hutche&s;on</HI> in all their names made a &s;peech to the Council: He began with decent expre&s;&s;ions of thanks to the King, and their Lord&s;hips: He &s;aid, they &s;hould at all times give &s;uch obedience to laws, and orders, as could &s;tand with a good con&s;cience. And &s;o they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. As for tho&s;e of them that were allowed to go to the Churches where they had &s;erved before, no difficulty could be made: But tho&s;e of them that were named to other Churches would not enter on the &s;erving them, till the Church &s;e&s;&s;ions, and the inhabitants of the pari&s;h met, and made choice of them for their pa&s;tors, and gave them a call (as they worded it) to &s;erve among them. But upon this, &s;cruples aro&s;e among &s;ome, who &s;aid the peoples choice ought to be free; whereas now they were limited to the per&s;on named by the Council, which looked like an elect|ion upon a <HI>Conge d'elire</HI> with a letter naming the per&s;on, with which they had often diverted them&s;elves. But &s;cruples are mighty things, when they concur with inclination or inter|e&s;t: And when they are not &s;upported by the&s;e, men learn di&s;|tinctions
<PB N="282" REF="297">
to get free from them. So it happened in this ca&s;e: For tho' &s;ome few were &s;tartled at the&s;e things, yet they lay in no man's way; for every man went, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Church marked out for him. And at fir&s;t the people of the country ran to them with a &s;ort of tran&s;port of joy. Yet this was &s;oon cooled. It was hoped, that they would have begun their mini&s;try with a publick te&s;timony again&s;t all that had been done in oppo&s;ition to what they were accu&s;tomed to call the work of God. But they were &s;ilent at that time, and preached only the doctrines of Chri&s;tianity. This di&s;gu&s;ted all tho&s;e who loved to hear their Mini&s;ters preach to the times, as they call'd it. The &s;top put to the Indulgence made many conclude, that tho&s;e, who had obtained the favour, had entred into &s;ecret en|gagements. So they came to call them the King's Curates, as they had called the Clergy in deri&s;ion the Bi&s;hop's Curates. Their caution brought them under a wor&s;e character of <HI>dumb dogs,</HI> that could not bark. Tho&s;e, who by their fierce behaviour had &s;hut them&s;elves out from a &s;hare in the Indulgence, began to call this Era&s;tiani&s;m, and the Civil Magi&s;trates a&s;&s;uming the pow|er of &s;acred matters. They &s;aid, this was vi&s;ibly an artifice to lay things a&s;leep with the pre&s;ent generation; and was one of the depths of <HI>Satan,</HI> to give a pre&s;ent quiet, in order to the certain de&s;truction of Pre&s;bytery. And it was al&s;o &s;aid, that there was a vi&s;ible departing of the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance from tho&s;e preachers: They preached no more with the power and authority that had accompanied them at Conventicles. So many began to fall off from them, and to go again to Conventicles. Many of the preachers confe&s;&s;ed to me, that they found an ignorance and a deadne&s;s among tho&s;e who had been the hotte&s;t upon their meetings, beyond what could have been imagined. They that could have argued about the intrin&s;ick power of the Church, and Epi&s;copacy, and Pre&s;bytery, upon which all their &s;ermons had chiefly run for &s;everal years, knew very little of the e&s;&s;en|tials of religion. But the indulged preachers, in&s;tead of &s;etting them&s;elves with the zeal and courage that became them again&s;t the follies of the people, of which they confe&s;&s;ed to my &s;elf they were very &s;en&s;ible, took a different method; and &s;tudied by mean compliances to gain upon their affections, and to take them out of the hands of &s;ome fiery men, that were going up and down among them. The tempers of &s;ome brought them under this &s;ervile popularity, into which others went out of a de|&s;ire to live ea&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="298">
The Indulgence was &s;ettled in a hurry. But when it came to be de&s;canted on, it appeared to be plainly again&s;t law: For by <NOTE PLACE="marg">This com|plained of as again&s;t law.</NOTE> the Act re&s;toring Epi&s;copacy none were capable of benefices, but &s;uch as &s;hould own the authority of Bi&s;hops, and be in&s;ti|tuted by them. So now the Epi&s;copal party, that were wont to put all authority in the King, as long as he was for them, be|gan to talk of law. They &s;aid, the King's power was bounded by the law; and that the&s;e proceedings were the trampling of law under foot. For all parties, as they need the &s;helter of law, or the &s;tretches of the prerogative, are apt by turns to magnify the one, or the other. <HI>Burnet</HI> and his Clergy were out of mea|&s;ure enraged at the indulgence. They were not only abandon|ed, but ill u&s;ed by the people, who were beginning to threat|en, or to buy them out of their Churches, that they al&s;o might have the benefit of the Indulgence. The Synod of the Clergy was held at <HI>Gla&s;cow</HI> in <HI>October:</HI> And they moved, that an ad|dre&s;s might be drawn up, repre&s;enting to the King the mi&s;eries they were under, occa&s;ioned by the Indulgence: They complain|ed of it as illegal, and as like to be fatal to the Church. This was, according to the words in &s;ome of their Acts of Parliament, a mi&s;repre&s;enting the King's proceedings, in order to the alie|nating the hearts of his &s;ubjects from him; which was made ca|pital, as may appear by the account given in the former book of the proceedings again&s;t the Lord <HI>Balmerinock.</HI> He that drew this addre&s;s was one <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> afterwards Archbi&s;hop, fir&s;t of <HI>Gla&s;cow,</HI> and then of St. <HI>Andrews;</HI> who was an ignorant man, and vio|lent out of mea&s;ure. So it was drawn full of acrimony. Yet they re&s;olved to keep it &s;ecret, till advice &s;hould be taken upon it; and accordingly to pre&s;ent it to the Privy Council, or not. A Copy of this was procured by indirect methods: And it was &s;ent up to Court, after the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was come off, and was in his way to hold the Parliament in <HI>Scotland.</HI> Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> had left all his concerns at Court with Sir <HI>Robert Murray:</HI> For, tho', at his Mi&s;tri&s;s's in&s;tigation, he had u&s;ed him very unworthily, yet he had &s;o great an opinion of his vertue and candor, that he left all his affairs to his care. As &s;oon as the King &s;aw the Clergy's addre&s;s, he &s;aid, it was a new we&s;t|ern remon&s;trance: And he ordered, that <HI>Burnet</HI> &s;hould not be &s;uffered to come to the Parliament, and that he &s;hould be pro|ceeded again&s;t as far as the law could carry the matter. It was not ea&s;y to &s;tretch this &s;o far, as to to make it criminal. But <HI>Burnet</HI> being obnoxious on other accounts, they intended to frighten him to &s;ubmit, and to re&s;ign his Bi&s;hoprick.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="299">
The Parliament was opened in <HI>November.</HI> Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s &s;peech ran upon two heads. The one was, the recommending to their care the pre&s;ervation of the Church, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> law: Upon which he took occa&s;ion to expre&s;s great zeal for Epi&s;|copacy. The other head related to the union of both Kingdoms. All that was done relating to that was, that an Act pa&s;s'd for a treaty about it: And in the following &s;ummer, in a &s;ub&s;equent &s;e&s;&s;ion, Commi&s;&s;ioners were named, who went up to treat about it. But they made no progre&s;s: And the thing fell &s;o &s;oon, that it was very vi&s;ible it was never intended in good earne&s;t.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t Acts that pa&s;s'd in Parliament were of more <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Supre|macy carri|ed very high.</NOTE> importance, and had a deeper de&s;ign. The fir&s;t explained, and a&s;&s;erted the King's Supremacy; but carried it in &s;uch general words, that it might have been &s;tretched to every thing. It was de|clared, that the &s;ettling all things relating to the external go|vernment of the Church was a right of the Crown: And that all things relating to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical meetings, matters, and per&s;ons, were to be ordered according to &s;uch directions as the King &s;hould &s;end to his Privy Council: And that the&s;e &s;hould be pub|li&s;hed by them, and &s;hould have the force of laws. Lord <HI>Lau|derdale</HI> very probably knew the &s;ecret of the Duke's religion, and had got into his favour. So it was very likely, that he in|tended to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf in it, by putting the Church of <HI>Scot|land</HI> wholly in his power. But that was yet a &s;ecret to us all in <HI>Scotland.</HI> The method he took to get it pa&s;s'd was this: He told all tho&s;e who loved Pre&s;bytery, or that did not much fa|vour the Bi&s;hops, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to keep them under, by making them depend ab&s;olutely on the King: This was indeed a transferring the whole legi&s;lature, as to the matters of the Church, from the Parliament, and ve&s;ting it &s;ingly in the King: Yet, he told them, if this was done, as the circum&s;tances might happen to be favourable, the King might be prevailed on, if a da&s;h of a pen would do it, to change all on the &s;udden: Where|as that could never be hoped for, if it could not be brought about, but by the pomp and ceremony of a Parliament. He made the Nobility &s;ee, they needed fear no more the in&s;olence of Bi&s;hops, if they were at mercy, as this would make them. <HI>Sharp</HI> did not like it, but dur&s;t not oppo&s;e it. He made a long dark &s;peech, copied out of Doctor <HI>Taylor,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hing between the Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority; and then voted for it: So did all the Bi&s;hops that were pre&s;ent: Some ab&s;ented them&s;elves. <HI>Leigh|to$n</HI> was again&s;t any &s;uch Act, and got &s;ome words to be alter|ed in it. He thought, it might be &s;tretched to ill ends: And &s;o he was very aver&s;e to it. Yet he gave his vote for it, not hav|ing
<PB N="285" REF="300">
&s;ufficiently con&s;idered the extent of the words, and the con&s;e|quences that might follow on &s;uch an Act; for which he was very &s;orry, as long as he lived. But at that time there was no apprehen&s;ions in <HI>Scotland</HI> of the danger of Popery. Many of the be&s;t of the Epi&s;copal Clergy, <HI>Nairn,</HI> and <HI>Charteris</HI> in par|ticular, were highly offended at the Act. They thought it plainly made the King our Pope. The Pre&s;byterians &s;aid, it put him in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s &s;tead. They &s;aid, the King had alrea|dy too much power in the matters of the Church: And no|thing ruined the Clergy more, than their being brought into &s;ervile compliances, and a ba&s;e dependance upon Courts. I had no &s;hare in the coun&s;els about this Act. I only thought it was de&s;igned by Lord <HI>Tweedale</HI> to ju&s;tify the Indulgence, which he prote&s;ted to me was his chief end in it. And no body could ever tell me how the word <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters</HI> was put in the Act. <HI>Leightoun</HI> thought, he was &s;ure it was put in after the draught and form of the Act was agreed on. It was generally charged on Lord <HI>Lauderdale.</HI> And when the Duke's religion came to be known, then all people &s;aw, how much the legal &s;ettlement of our religion was put in his power by this means. Yet the pre|amble of the Act being only concerning the external govern|ment of the Church, it was thought, that the words <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal matters</HI> were to be confined to the &s;en&s;e that was limited by the preamble.</P>
<P>The next Act that pa&s;s'd was concerning the Militia: All that <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Act for the County Militia.</NOTE> had been done in rai&s;ing it was approved: And it was enacted, that it &s;hould &s;till be kept up, and be ready to march into any of the King's dominions, for any cau&s;e in which his Maje&s;ty's authority, power, or greatne&s;s &s;hould be concerned; and that the orders &s;hould be tran&s;mitted to them from the Council board, without any mention of orders from the King. Upon this great reflections were made. Some &s;aid, that by this the Army was taken out of the King's power and command, and put under the power of the Council: So that if the greater part of the Council &s;hould again rebel, as they did in the year 1638, the Army was by the words of this Act bound to follow their orders. But, when jealou&s;ies broke out in <HI>England</HI> of the ill de&s;igns that lay hid under this matter, it was thought that the intent of this clau&s;e was, that, if the King &s;hould call in the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Army, it &s;hould not be nece&s;&s;ary that he him&s;elf &s;hould &s;end any or|ders for it; but that, upon a &s;ecret intimation, the Council might do it without order, and then, if the de&s;ign &s;hould mi&s;|carry, it &s;hould not lie on the King, but only on the Council, whom in that ca&s;e the King might di&s;own; and &s;o none about
<PB N="286" REF="301">
him &s;hould be blameable for it. The Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> valued him&s;elf upon the&s;e Acts, as if he had conquered Kingdoms by them. He wrote a letter to the King upon it, in which he &s;aid, all <HI>Scotland</HI> was now in his power: The Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> was now more &s;ubject to him than the Church of <HI>England</HI> was: This Militia was now an Army ready upon call: And that every man in <HI>Scotland</HI> was ready to march, when&s;oever he &s;hould order it, with &s;everal very ill in&s;inuations in it. But &s;o dangerous thing it is a to write &s;uch letters to Princes: This letter fell into Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s hands &s;ome years after: And I had it in my hands for &s;ome days. It was intended to found an impeachment on it. But that happened at the time when the bu&s;ine&s;s of the exclu|&s;ion of the Duke from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown was &s;o hot|ly pur&s;ued, that, this, which at another time would have made great noi&s;e, was not &s;o much con&s;idered as the importance of of it might &s;eem to de&s;erve. The way how it came into &s;uch hands was this: The King, after he had read the letter, gave it to Sir <HI>Robert Murray:</HI> And when he died it was found among his papers. He had been much tru&s;ted in the King's laboratory, and had &s;everal of his chymical proce&s;&s;es in his hands. So the King after his death did order one to look over all his pa|pers for chymical matters: But all the papers of State were let alone. So this, with many other papers, fell into the hands of his executors. And thus this letter came into Duke <HI>Hamil|ton</HI>'s hands; who would have made u&s;e of it, if greater matters had not been then in agitation. This is not the &s;ingle in&s;tance, that I have known, of papers of great con&s;equence falling into the hands of the executors of great Mini&s;ters, that might have been turned to very bad u&s;es, if they had fallen into ill hands. It &s;eems of great concern, that when a Mini&s;ter, or an Am|ba&s;&s;adour, dies, or is recalled, or is di&s;graced, all papers rela|ting to the &s;ecrets of his employment &s;hould be of right in the power of the Government. But I of all men &s;hould complain the lea&s;t of this, &s;ince by this remi&s;&s;ne&s;s many papers of a high nature have fallen in my way.</P>
<P>By the Act of Supremacy the King was now ma&s;ter, and could <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Burnet</HI> turn|ed out, and <HI>Le$g$t$un</HI> made Arch|bi&s;hop o$ <HI>Gla&s;cow</HI></NOTE> turn out Bi&s;hops at plea&s;ure. This had its fir&s;t effect on <HI>Bur|net;</HI> who was offered a pen&s;ion, if he would &s;ubmit and re&s;ign, and was threatened to be treated more &s;everely, if he &s;tood out. He complied, and retired to a private &s;tate of life, and bore his di&s;grace better than he had done his honours. He lived four years in the &s;hade, and was generally much pitied: He was of him&s;elf good natured, and &s;incere; but was much in the power of others: He meddled too much in that which did not belong
<PB N="287" REF="302">
to him, and he did not under&s;tand; for he was not cut out for a Court, or for the Mini&s;try: And he was too remi&s;s in that which was properly his bu&s;ine&s;s, and which he under&s;tood to a good degree; for he took no manner of care of the &s;piritual part of his function.</P>
<P>At this time the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Gla&s;cow,</HI> to whom the choice <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;tate I found things in at <HI>Gla&s;|cow.</HI></NOTE> of the Profe&s;&s;or of divinity does belong, cho&s;e me, tho' un|known to them all, to be Profe&s;&s;or there. There was no &s;ort of artifice or management to bring this about: It came of them|&s;elves: And they did it without any recommendation of any per|&s;on what&s;oever. So I was advi&s;ed by all my friends to change my po&s;t, and go thither. This engaged me both into much &s;tudy, and in a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s. The Clergy came all to me, thinking I had &s;ome credit with tho&s;e that governed, and laid their grievances and complaints before me. They were very ill u&s;ed, and were &s;o entirely for&s;aken by their people, that in mo&s;t places they &s;hut up their Churches: They were al&s;o threatened and affronted on all occa&s;ions. On the other hand the Gentlemen of the country came much to me, and told me &s;uch &s;trange things of the vices of &s;ome, the follies of others, and the indi&s;cretions of them all, that, tho' it was not rea&s;ona|ble to believe all that they &s;aid, yet it was impo&s;&s;ible not to be|lieve a great deal of it. And &s;o I &s;oon &s;aw, what a hard pro|vince I was like to have of it. Accounts of the &s;tate of tho&s;e parts were expected from me, and were like to be believed. And it was not ea&s;y to know, what ought to be believed, nor how matters were to be repre&s;ented: For I found calumny was &s;o equally practi&s;ed on both &s;ides, that I came to mi&s;tru&s;t every thing that I heard. One thing was vi&s;ible, that Conventicles abounded, and &s;trange doctrine was vented in them. The King's Supre|macy was now the chief &s;ubject of declamation: It was &s;aid, Bi&s;hops were indeed enemies to the liberties of the Church, but the King's little finger would be heavier than their loins had been. After I had been for &s;ome months among them, and had heard &s;o much, that I believed very little, I wrote to Lord <HI>Twee|dale,</HI> that di&s;orders did certainly increa&s;e; but, as for any parti|culars, I did not know what to believe, much le&s;s could I &s;ug|ge&s;t what remedies &s;eemed proper: I therefore propo&s;ed, that a Committee of Council might be &s;ent round the country to exa|mine matters, and to give &s;uch orders as were at pre&s;ent nece&s;|&s;ary for the publick quiet; and that they might prepare a report again&s;t the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, that then proper remedies might be found out.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="303">
Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> Lord <HI>Kincardin, Primero&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Drumond,</HI> were &s;ent to the&s;e parts. They met fir&s;t at <HI>Hamilton,</HI> next at <HI>Gla&s;cow:</HI> Then they went to other parts; and came back, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Commit|tee of Coun|cil &s;ent round the We&s;t.</NOTE> ended their circuit at <HI>Gla&s;cow.</HI> They puni&s;hed &s;ome di&s;orders, and threatened both the indulged Mini&s;ters, and the countries, with greater &s;everities, if they &s;hould &s;till grow more and more in&s;olent upon the favour that had been &s;hewed them. I was blamed by the Pre&s;byterians for all they did, and by the Epi&s;|copal party for all they did not; &s;ince the&s;e thought they did too little, as the others thought they did too much. They con|&s;ulted much with me; and &s;uffered me to intercede &s;o effectual|ly for tho&s;e whom they had put in pri&s;on, that they were all &s;et at liberty. The Epi&s;copal party thought I intended to make my &s;elf popular at their co&s;t: So they began that &s;train of fury and calumny that has pur&s;ued me ever &s;ince from that &s;ort of people, as a &s;ecret enemy to their intere&s;t, and an underminer of it. But I was, and &s;till am, an enemy to all force and vio|lence in matters of con&s;cience: And there is no principle that is more hated by bad, ill natured Clergymen, than that.</P>
<P>The Earls of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> and <HI>Tweedale</HI> pre&s;&s;ed <HI>Leightoun</HI> much to accept of the See of <HI>Gla&s;cow.</HI> He declined it with &s;o much aver&s;ion, that we were all unea&s;y at it. Nothing moved him to hearken to it, but the hopes of bringing about the accommodati|on that was propo&s;ed; in which he had all a&s;&s;i&s;tance promi&s;ed him from the Government. The King ordered him to be &s;ent for to Court. He &s;ent for me on his way; where he &s;topt a day, to know from me what pro&s;pect there was of doing any good. I could not much encourage him: Yet I gave him all the hopes that I could rai&s;e my &s;elf to: And I was then inclined to think, that the accommodation was not impracticable. Up|on his coming to <HI>London,</HI> he found Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s temper was much inflamed: He was become fierce and intractable. But Lord <HI>Tweedale</HI> made every thing as ea&s;y to him as was po&s;&s;ible. They had turned out an Archbi&s;hop: So it concerned them to put an eminent man in his room, who &s;hould order matters with &s;uch moderation, that the Government &s;hould not be un|der perpetual di&s;turbance by rea&s;on of complaints from tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>But now the Court was entring into new de&s;igns, into which <NOTE PLACE="marg">1670.</NOTE> Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was thru&s;ting him&s;elf, with an ob&s;equious, or rather an officious zeal. I will dwell no longer at pre&s;ent on that, than ju&s;t to name the Duche&s;s of <HI>Orleans</HI>'s coming to <HI>Do|ver,</HI> of which a more particular account &s;hall be given, after
<PB N="289" REF="304">
that I have laid together all that relates to <HI>Scotland</HI> in the year 1670&punc; and the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the Accommodation. <HI>Leigh|toun</HI> propo&s;ed to the King his &s;cheme of the Accommodation, and the great advantages that his Maje&s;ty's affairs would have, if that country could be brought into temper. The King was <NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;tructions for an re|commoda|tion.</NOTE> at this time gone off from the de&s;ign of a comprehen&s;ion in <HI>En|gland.</HI> Toleration was now thought the be&s;t way. Yet the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him with the nece&s;&s;ity of doing &s;ome|what to &s;often the <HI>Scots,</HI> in order to the great de&s;ign he was then engaging in. Upon that the King, who &s;eldom gave him|&s;elf the trouble to think twice of any one thing, gave way to it. <HI>Leightoun</HI>'s paper was in &s;ome places corrected by Sir <HI>Robert Murray;</HI> and was turned into in&s;tructions, by which Lord <HI>Lau|derdale</HI> was authori&s;ed to pa&s;s the conce&s;&s;ions, that were to be offered, into laws. This he would never own to me, tho' <HI>Leigh|toun</HI> &s;hewed me the copy of them. But it appeared probable by his conduct afterwards, that he had &s;ecret directions to &s;poil the matter, and that he intended to deceive us all. Lord <HI>Twee|dale</HI> was more to be depended on. But he began to loo&s;e ground with Lady <HI>Dy&s;ert:</HI> And &s;o his intere&s;t did not continue &s;trong enough to carry on &s;uch a matter.</P>
<P><HI>Leightoun</HI> undertook the admini&s;tration of the See of <HI>Gla&s;cow:</HI> And it was a year after this before he was prevailed on to be tran&s;lated thither. He came upon this to <HI>Gla&s;cow,</HI> and held a Synod of his Clergy; in which nothing was to be heard, but complaints of de&s;ertion and ill u&s;age from them all. <HI>Leigh|toun,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Leightoun</HI>'s advices to his Clergy.</NOTE> in a &s;ermon that he preached to them, and in &s;everal di&s;|cour&s;es, both in publick and private, exhorted them to look up more to God, to con&s;ider them&s;elves as the mini&s;ters of the Cro&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> to bear the contempt and ill u&s;age they met with as a Cro&s;s laid on them for the exerci&s;e of their faith and patience, to lay a&s;ide all the appetites of revenge, to humble them&s;elves before God, to have many days for &s;ecret fa&s;ting and prayers, and to meet often together that they might quicken and a&s;&s;i&s;t one another in tho&s;e holy exerci&s;es: And then they might expect ble&s;|&s;ings from Heaven upon their labours. This was a new &s;train to the Clergy. They had nothing to &s;ay again&s;t it: But it was a comfortle&s;s doctrine to them: And they had not been accu&s;tom|ed to it. No &s;peedy ways were propo&s;ed for forcing the people to come to Church, nor for &s;ending &s;oldiers among them, or rai&s;ing the fines to which they were liable. So they went home, as little edified with their new Bi&s;hop, as he was with them. When this was over, he went round &s;ome parts of the country to the mo&s;t eminent of the indulged Mini&s;ters, and carried me
<PB N="290" REF="305">
with him. His bu&s;ine&s;s was, to per&s;uade them to hearken to propo&s;itions of peace. He told them, &s;ome of them would be quickly &s;ent for to <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> where terms would be offered them in order to the making up our differences: All was &s;incerely meant: They would meet with no artifices, nor hard&s;hips: And if they received tho&s;e offers heartily, they would be turned into laws: And all the vacancies then in the Church would be filled by their brethren. They received this with &s;o much indifference, or rather neglect, that it would have cooled any zeal, that was le&s;s warm, and le&s;s active, than that good man's was. They were &s;carce civil; and did not &s;o much as thank him for his tender|ne&s;s and care: The more artful among them, &s;uch as <HI>Hutche|&s;on,</HI> &s;aid, it was a thing of general concern, and they were but &s;ingle men. Others were more metaphy&s;ical, and entertained us with &s;ome poor arguings and di&s;tinctions. <HI>Leightoun</HI> began to lo&s;e heart. Yet he re&s;olved to &s;et the negotiation on foot, and carry it as far as he could.</P>
<P>When Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> came down to hold a &s;e&s;&s;ion of Par|liament, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A confe|rence be|tween <HI>Lerghtoun</HI> and &s;ome Presbyteri|ans.</NOTE> letters were writ to &s;ix of the Pre&s;byterian preachers, ordering them to come to town. There was a long conference between <HI>Leightoun</HI> and them, before the Earls of <HI>Lauderdale, Rothes, Tweedale,</HI> and <HI>Kincardin. Sharp</HI> would not be pre&s;ent at it: But he ordered <HI>Pater&s;on,</HI> afterwards Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Gla&s;|cow</HI> to hear all, and to bring him an account of what pa&s;&s;ed. <HI>Leightoun</HI> laid before them the mi&s;chief of our divi&s;ions, and of the &s;chi&s;m that they had occa&s;ioned: Many &s;ouls were lo&s;t, and many more were in danger by the&s;e means: So that every one ought to do all he could to heal this wide breach, that had al|ready let in &s;o many evils among us, which were like to make way to many more: For his own part, he was per&s;uaded that Epi&s;copacy, as an order di&s;tinct from Pre&s;byters, had continued in the Church ever &s;ince the days of the Apo&s;tles; that the world had every where received the Chri&s;tian religion from Bi|&s;hops, and that a parity among Clergymen was never thought of in the Church before the middle of the la&s;t century, and was then &s;et up rather by accident than on de&s;ign: Yet, how much &s;oever he was per&s;uaded of this, &s;ince they were of ano|ther mind, he was now to offer a temper to them, by which both &s;ides might &s;till pre&s;erve their opinions, and yet unite in carrying on the ends of the Go&s;pel and their Mini&s;try: They had Moderators among&s;t them, which was no divine in&s;titution, but only a matter of order: The King therefore might name the&s;e: And the making them con&s;tant could be no &s;uch encroach|ment on their function, as that the peace of the Church mu&s;t
<PB N="291" REF="306">
be broke on &s;uch an account: Nor could they &s;ay, that the ble&s;&s;ing of the men named to this function by an impo&s;ition of hands did degrade them from their former office, to &s;ay no more of it: So they were &s;till at lea&s;t Mini&s;ters: It is true, others thought, they had a new and &s;pecial authority, more than a bare pre&s;idency: That did not concern them, who were not required to concur with them in any thing, but in &s;ubmitting to this pre&s;idency: And, as to that, they &s;hould be allowed to de|clare their own opinion again&s;t it, in as full, and as publick a manner as they plea&s;ed: He laid it to their con&s;ciences, to con|&s;ider of the whole matter, as in the pre&s;ence of God, without any regard to party, or popularity. He &s;poke in all near half an hour, with a gravity and force that made a very great impre&s;&s;ion on tho&s;e who heard it. <HI>Hutche&s;on</HI> an&s;wered, and &s;aid, their opinion for a parity among the Clergy was well known: The pre&s;idency now &s;poke of had made way to a lordly domi|nion in the Church: And therefore how incon&s;iderable &s;oever the thing might &s;eem to be, yet the effects of it both had been, and would be very con&s;iderable: He therefore de&s;ired, &s;ome time might be given them to con&s;ider well of the propo&s;itions now made, and to con&s;ult with their brethren about them: And, &s;ince this might &s;eem an a&s;&s;embling together again&s;t law, he de&s;ired, they might have the King's Commi&s;&s;ioner's leave for it. This was immediately granted. We had a &s;econd conference, in which matters were more fully opened, and pre&s;&s;ed home, on the grounds formerly mentioned. Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> made us all dine together, and came to us after dinner: But could &s;carce re&s;train him&s;elf from flying out; for their behaviour &s;eemed both rude and crafty. But <HI>Leightoun</HI> had prepared him for it, and pre&s;&s;ed him not to give them a handle to excu&s;e their flying off, by any roughne&s;s in his deportment towards them. The propo&s;itions offered them were now generally known. <HI>Sharp</HI> cried out, that Epi&s;copacy was to be undermined, &s;ince the negative vote was to be let go. The inferiour Clergy thought, that if it took effect, and the Pre&s;byterians were to be general|ly brought into Churches, they would be neglected, and that their people would for&s;ake them. So they hated the whole thing. The bigotted Pre&s;byterians thought, it was a &s;nare, and the doing that, which had a fair appearance at pre&s;ent, and was meant on|ly to lay that generation in their graves in peace; by which means Epi&s;copacy, that was then &s;haking over all the Nation, would come to have another root, and grow again out of that. But the far greater part of the Nation approved of this de&s;ign: And they reckoned, either we &s;hould gain our point, and then
<PB N="292" REF="307">
all would be at quiet, or, if &s;uch offers were rejected by the Pre&s;byterians, it would di&s;cover their temper, and alienate all indifferent men from them; and the Nation would be convinced, how unrea&s;onable and &s;tubborn they were, and how unworthy they were of any farther favour. All that was done in this &s;e&s;&s;i|on of Parliament was, the rai&s;ing a tax, and the naming Commi&s;&s;ioners for the union with <HI>England;</HI> be&s;ides two &s;evere Acts pa&s;s'd again&s;t Conventicles.</P>
<P>There had been a great one held in <HI>Fife,</HI> near <HI>Dunfermlin,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">New &s;everi|ties again&s;t Conventi|cles.</NOTE> where none had ever been held before. Some Gentlemen of e&s;tates were among them: And the novelty of the thing drew a great croud together; for intimation had been given of it &s;ome days before. Many of the&s;e came in their ordinary arms. That gave a handle to call them the <HI>Rendezvous</HI> of rebellion. Some of them were taken, and brought to <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> and pre&s;&s;ed to name as many as they knew of their fellow Conventiclers: But they refu&s;ed to do it. This was &s;ent up to Court, and repre|&s;ented as the fore-runner of rebellion. Upon which Lord <HI>Lau|derdale,</HI> hearing what u&s;e his enemies made of it, was tran&s;port|ed almo&s;t to fits of rage. Severe Acts pa&s;&s;ed upon it, by which their fines were rai&s;ed higher, and they were made liable to ar|bitrary &s;everities. The Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> with his own hand put in a word in the Act, that covered the Papi&s;ts, the fines be|ing laid on &s;uch of the reformed religion as went not to Church. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The reform|ed religion.</NOTE> He pretended by this to merit with the Popi&s;h party, the Duke in particular; who&s;e religion was yet a &s;ecret to us in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> tho' it was none at Court. He &s;aid to my &s;elf, he had put in the&s;e words on de&s;ign to let the party know, they were to be wor&s;e u&s;ed than the Papi&s;ts them&s;elves. All Field Con|venticles were declared trea&s;onable: And in the preacher they were made capital. The Landlords, on who&s;e grounds they were held, were to be &s;everely fined: And all who were at them were to be puni&s;hed arbitrarily, if they did not di&s;cover all that were pre&s;ent, whom they knew. Hou&s;e Conventicles, crouded with|out the doors, or at the windows, were to be reckoned, and pu|ni&s;hed, as Field Conventicles. Sir <HI>Robert Murray</HI> told me, that the King was not well plea&s;ed with this Act, as being extrava|gantly &s;evere; chiefly in that of the preachers being to be puni&s;hed by death. He &s;aid, bloody laws did no good; and that he would never have pa&s;&s;ed it, if he had known it before hand. The half of the Parliament abhorred this Act. Yet &s;o abject were they in their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to Lord <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> that the young Earl of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ilis</HI> was the &s;ingle per&s;on that voted in the negative. This pa&s;s'd in Parliament &s;o &s;uddenly, that <HI>Leightoun</HI> knew no|thing
<PB N="293" REF="308">
of it, till it was too late. He expo&s;tulated with Lord <HI>Twee|dale</HI> &s;everely about it: He &s;aid, the whole complex of it was &s;o contrary to the common rules of humanity, not to &s;ay Chri&s;tia|nity, that he was a&s;hamed to mix in coun&s;els with tho&s;e who could frame and pa&s;s &s;uch Acts: And he thought it &s;omewhat &s;trange, that neither he, nor I, had been advi&s;ed with in it. The Earl of <HI>Tweedale</HI> &s;aid, the late Field Conventicle being a new thing, it had forced them to &s;everities, that at another time could not be well excu&s;ed: And he a&s;&s;ured us, there was no de|&s;ign to put it in execution.</P>
<P><HI>Leightoun</HI> &s;ent to the we&s;tern Counties &s;ix Epi&s;copal Divines, all except my &s;elf brought from other parts: <HI>Nai$$</HI> and <HI>Charteris</HI> were two of them: The three others <HI>Aird, Cook,</HI> and <HI>Pater&s;on,</HI> were the be&s;t we could per&s;uade to go round the country to preach in va|cant Churches, and to argue upon the grounds of the accommo|dation with &s;uch as &s;hould come to them. The Epi&s;copal Clergy, who were yet in the country, could not argue much for any thing; and would not at all argue in favour of a propo&s;ition that they hated. The people of the country came generally to hear us, tho' not in great crouds. We were indeed amazed to &s;ee a poor commonalty &s;o capable to argue upon points of government, and on the bounds to be &s;et to the power of Princes in matters of religion: Upon all the&s;e topicks they had texts of &s;cripture at hand; and were ready with their an&s;wers to any thing that was &s;aid to them. This mea&s;ure of knowledge was &s;pread even among the meane&s;t of them, their cottagers, and their &s;ervants. They were indeed vain of their knowledge, much conceited of them&s;elves, and were full of a mo&s;t entangled &s;crupulo&s;ity; &s;o that they found, or made, difficulties in every thing that could be laid before them. We &s;taid about three months in the country: And in that time there was a &s;tand in the frequency of Conventicles. But, as &s;oon as we were gone, a &s;et of tho&s;e hot preachers went round all the places in which we had been, to defeat all the good we could hope to do. They told them, the Devil was never &s;o formidable, as when he was transformed into an Angel of light.</P>
<P>The outed Mini&s;ters had many meetings in &s;everal parts of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Presbyterians re|&s;olved to $word$ $word$ the o$|$ers made them.</NOTE> Kingdom. They found them&s;elves under great difficulties. The people had got it among them, that all that was now driven at, was only to extingui&s;h Presbytery, by &s;ome &s;eeming conce&s;&s;ions, with the pre&s;ent generation; and that if the Mini&s;ters went into it, they gave up their cau&s;e, that &s;o they them&s;elves might be provided for during their lives, and die at more ca&s;e. So they, who were &s;trangely &s;ubdued by their de&s;ire of popularity, re&s;olv|ed
<PB N="294" REF="309">
to reject the propo&s;itions, tho' they could not well tell on what grounds they &s;hould ju&s;tify it. A report was al&s;o &s;pread a|mong them, which they believed, and had its full effect upon them: It was &s;aid, that the King was alienated from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and weary of &s;upporting Epi&s;copacy in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and &s;o was re&s;olved not to clog his Government any longer with it; and that the conce&s;&s;ions now made did not ari&s;e from any tenderne&s;s we had for them, but from an artifice to pre&s;erve Epi&s;copacy: So they were made believe, that their agreeing to them was really a &s;trengthening of that Government, which was o|therwi&s;e ready to fall with its own weight. And becau&s;e a pa&s;|&s;age of Scripture, according to its general &s;ound, was apt to work much on them, that of <HI>touch not, ta&s;te not, handle not,</HI> it was often repeated among them. It was generally agreed on to reject the offers made them. The next debate among them was, about the rea&s;ons they were to give for rejecting them; or whether they would comply with another propo&s;ition, which <HI>Leightoun</HI> had made them, that, if they did not like the propo&s;itions he had made, they would &s;ee, if they could be more happy than he was, and offer at other propo&s;itions. In their meetings they named two to maintain the debate, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con.</HI> They di&s;puted about the prote&s;tation that they were allowed to make: And <HI>Pro|te&s;tatio contraria facto</HI> was a maxim that was in great vogue among them. They argued upon the obligation by the Covenant to maintain their Church, as then e&s;tabli&s;hed, in doctrine, wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline, and government: And &s;o every thing that was contra|ry to that, was repre&s;ented as a breach of covenant: And none dur&s;t object to that. But that they might make a propo&s;ition, which they were &s;ure would not be hearkened to, they propo&s;ed, that among the conce&s;&s;ions to be in&s;i&s;ted on, one might be a li|berty to ordain without the Bi&s;hops. When we heard what their rea|&s;onings were, papers were writ, and &s;ent among them, in an&s;wer to them. But it is a vain thing to argue, when a re&s;olution is taken up, not founded on argument; and arguments are only &s;ought for, to ju&s;tify that which is already re&s;olved on. We pre&s;|&s;ed them with this, that, notwith&s;tanding their Covenant, they them&s;elves had afterwards made many alterations, much more important than this of &s;ubmitting to a con&s;tant Moderator, named by the King: <HI>Cromwell</HI> took from them the power of meeting in General A&s;&s;emblies: Yet they went on doing the other duties of their function; tho' this, which they e&s;teemed the greate&s;t of all their rights, was denied them: When an order came out to &s;eque&s;ter the half of the benefices of &s;uch as &s;hould &s;till pray for the King, they upon that &s;ubmitted, tho' before they had a&s;&s;er|ted
<PB N="295" REF="310">
it as a duty, to which they were bound by their Covenant: They had di&s;continued their mini&s;try, in obedience to laws and proclamations now for nine years: And tho&s;e, who had accept|ed the Indulgence, had come in by the King's authority, and had only a parochial government, but did not meet in Presbyteries: From all which we inferred, that, when they had a mind to lay down any thing that they thought a duty, or to &s;ubmit to any thing that they thought an inva&s;ion of their rights, they could find a di&s;tinction for it: And it was not ea&s;y to &s;hew, why they were not as compliant in this particular. But all was lo&s;t labour: Hot men among them were po&s;itive: And all of them were full of contention.</P>
<P>Duche&s;s <HI>Hamilton</HI> &s;ent for &s;ome of them, <HI>Hutche&s;on</HI> in parti|cular. She &s;aid, &s;he did not pretend to under&s;tand nice di&s;tinc|tions, and the terms of di&s;pute: Here was plain &s;en&s;e: The coun|try might be again at quiet, and the re&s;t of tho&s;e that were outed admitted to Churches, on terms, that &s;eemed to all rea&s;onable men very ea&s;y: Their rejecting this would give a very ill cha|racter of them, and would have very bad effects, of which they might &s;ee cau&s;e to repent, when it would be too late. She told me, all that &s;he could draw from him, that &s;he under&s;tood, was, that he &s;aw the generality of their party was re&s;olved again&s;t all treaties, or any agreement; and that, if a &s;mall number &s;hould break off from them, it would not heal the old breaches, but would create new ones. In conclu&s;ion, nothing was like to &s;ol|low on this whole negotiation. We, who were engaged in it, had lo&s;t all our own &s;ide by offering at it: And the Presbyterians would not make one &s;tep towards us.</P>
<P><HI>Leightoun</HI> de&s;ired another meeting with them at <HI>Pa&s;ley,</HI> to which he carried me and one or two more. They were about thirty. We had two long conferences with them. <HI>Leightoun</HI> laid <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some confe|rences that &s;ubject</NOTE> out before them the obligations that lay on them to &s;eek for peace at all times, but more e&s;pecially when we already &s;aw the di&s;|mal effects of our contentions: There could be no agreement, unle&s;s on both &s;ides there was a di&s;po&s;ition to make &s;ome abate|ments, and &s;ome &s;teps towards one another: It appeared, that we were willing to make even unrea&s;onable ones on our &s;ide: And would they abate nothing in theirs? Was their opinion &s;o mathematically certain, that they could not di&s;pen&s;e with any part of it, for the peace of the Church, and for the &s;aving of &s;ouls&punc; Many poor things were &s;aid on their &s;ide, which would have made a le&s;s mild man, than he was, lo&s;e all patience. But he bore with all: And urged this que&s;tion on them, Would they have held communion with the Church of God at the time of the
<PB N="296" REF="311">
council of <HI>Nice,</HI> or not? If they &s;hould &s;ay, not, he would be le&s;s de&s;irous of entring into communion with them; &s;ince he mu&s;t &s;ay of the Church at that time, <HI>let my &s;oul be with theirs:</HI> If they &s;aid, they would; then he was &s;ure, they would not re|ject the offers now made them, which brought Epi&s;copacy much lower than it was at that time. One of the mo&s;t learned among them had prepared a &s;peech full of quotations, to prove the dif|ference between the primitive Epi&s;copacy and ours at pre&s;ent. I was then full of tho&s;e matters: So I an&s;wered all his &s;peech, and every one of his quotations, and turned the whole upon him, with advantages that were too evident to be &s;o much as denied by their own party: And, it &s;eemed, the per&s;on him&s;elf thought &s;o; for he did not offer at one word of reply. In con|clu&s;ion, the Pre&s;byterians de&s;ired, that the propo&s;itions might be given them in writing: For hitherto all had pa&s;s'd only ver|bally; and words, they &s;aid, might be mi&s;under&s;tood, mi&s;re|peated, and denied. <HI>Leightoun</HI> had no mind to do it: Yet, &s;ince it was plau&s;ible, to &s;ay they had nothing but words to &s;hew to their brethren, he wrote them down, and gave me the original, which I &s;till have in my hands; but &s;uffered them to take as ma|ny copies of it as they plea&s;ed. At parting he de&s;ired them to come to a final re&s;olution, as &s;oon as they could; for he believ|ed, they would be called for by the next <HI>January</HI> to give their an&s;wers. And by the end of that month they were ordered to come to <HI>Edenburgh.</HI> I went thither at the &s;ame time upon <HI>Leigh|toun</HI>'s de&s;ire.</P>
<P>We met at the Earl of <HI>Rothes</HI>'s hou&s;e, where all this treaty came to a &s;hort conclu&s;ion. <HI>Hutche&s;on</HI> in all their names &s;aid, <NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$y $span$ to $span$ the $span$.</NOTE> they had con&s;idered the propo&s;itions made to them, but were not &s;atisfied in their con&s;ciences to accept of them. <HI>Leightoun</HI> de|&s;ired to know upon what grounds they &s;tood out. <HI>Hutche&s;on</HI> &s;aid, it was not &s;afe to argue again&s;t law. <HI>Leightoun</HI> &s;aid, that, &s;ince the Government had &s;et on a treaty with them in order to the altering the laws, they were certainly left to a full freedom of ar|guing again&s;t them: The&s;e offers were no laws: So the arguing about them could not be called an arguing again&s;t law: He of|fered them a publick conference upon them, in the hearing on all that had a mind to be rightly informed: He &s;aid, the peo+ple were drawn into tho&s;e matters &s;o far, as to make a &s;chi&s;m up|on them: He thought, it was therefore very rea&s;onable, that they &s;hould likewi&s;e hear the grounds examined, upon which both &s;ides went. <HI>Hutche&s;on</HI> re&s;u&s;ed this: He &s;aid, he was but one man; and that what he &s;aid was in the name of his brethren, who had given him no farther authority. <HI>Leightoun</HI> then a&s;ked,
<PB N="297" REF="312">
if they had nothing on their &s;ide to propo&s;e towards the healing of our breaches. <HI>Hutche&s;on</HI> an&s;wered, their principles were well enough known, but he had nothing to propo&s;e. Up|on this <HI>Leightoun,</HI> in a long di&s;cour&s;e, told what was the de|&s;ign he had been driving at in all this negotiation: It was to pro|cure peace, and to promote religion: He had offered &s;everal things, which he was per&s;uaded were great diminutions of the ju&s;t rights of Epi&s;copacy: Yet &s;ince all Church-power was for edifi|cation, and not for de&s;truction, he had thought, that in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances it might have conduced as much to the intere&s;t of religion, that Epi&s;copacy &s;hould dive&s;t it &s;elf of a great part of the authority that belonged to it, as the Bi&s;hop's u&s;ing it in former ages had been an advantage to religion: His offers did not flow from any mi&s;tru&s;t of the cau&s;e: He was per&s;uaded, Epi&s;copacy was handed down thro' all the ages of the Church from the Apo&s;tles days: Perhaps he had wronged the order by the conce&s;&s;ions he had made: Yet he was confident God would forgive it, as he hoped his brethren would excu&s;e it: Now they thought fit to reject the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, without either offer|ing any rea&s;on for doing it, or any expedient on their &s;ide: Therefore the continuance of our divi&s;ions mu&s;t lie at their door, both before God and man: If ill effects followed upon this, he was free of all blame, and had done his part. Thus was this treaty broke off, to the amazement of all &s;ober and di&s;pa&s;&s;io|nate people, and to the great joy of <HI>Sharp,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Bi&s;hops; who now for a while &s;eemed even plea&s;ed with us, be|cau&s;e we had all along a&s;&s;erted Epi&s;copacy, and had pleaded for it in a high and po&s;itive &s;train.</P>
<P>I hope this will be thought an u&s;eful part of the hi&s;tory of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen&s;ures pa&s;s'd upon this whole matter.</NOTE> that time: None knew the &s;teps made in it better than my &s;elf. The fierce Epi&s;copal men will &s;ee, how much they were to blame for accu&s;ing that Apo&s;tolical man <HI>Leightoun,</HI> as they did, on this occa&s;ion; as if he had de&s;igned in this whole matter to betray his own order, and to &s;et up Pre&s;bytery. The Pre&s;byterians may al&s;o &s;ee, how much their behaviour di&s;gu&s;ted all wi&s;e, mo|derate and good men, when they rejected propo&s;itions, that came &s;o home even to the maxims they had &s;et up, that nothing but the fear of offending, that is of loo&s;ing the credit they had with their party, could be &s;o much as pretended for their refu&s;ing to agree to them. Our part in the whole negotiation was &s;incere and open. We were acted with no other principle, and had no other de&s;ign, but to allay a violent agitation of men's &s;pirits, that was throwing us into great di&s;tractions; and to heal a breach, that was like to let in an inundation of mi&s;eries upon
<PB N="298" REF="313">
us, as has appeared but too evidently ever &s;ince. The high par|ty, keeping &s;till their old bia&s;s to per&s;ecution, and recovering af|terwards their credit with the Government, carried violent pro|ceedings &s;o far, that, after they had thrown the Nation into great convul&s;ions, they drew upon them&s;elves &s;uch a degree of fury from enraged multitudes, whom they had oppre&s;&s;ed long and heavily, that, in conclu&s;ion, the Epi&s;copal order was put down, as &s;hall be told in its proper place. The roughne&s;s of our own &s;ide, and the perver&s;ene&s;s of the Pre&s;byterians, did &s;o much alienate me from both, that I re&s;olved to withdraw my &s;elf from any far|ther meddling, and to give my &s;elf wholly to &s;tudy. I was then, and for three years after that, offered to be made a Bi&s;hop: But I refu&s;ed it. I &s;aw the coun&s;els were altering above: So I re&s;olved to look on, and &s;ee whither things would turn.</P>
<P>My acquaintance at <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and the favour and friend&s;hip <NOTE PLACE="marg">1671. The Me|moirs of the Dukes of <HI>Hamilton</HI> was writ by m$ at that time.</NOTE> I met with from both the Duke and Duche&s;s, made me offer my &s;ervice to them, in order to the &s;earch of many papers, that were very carefully pre&s;erved by them: For the Duche&s;s's uncle had charged her to keep them with the &s;ame care, as &s;he kept the writings of her e&s;tate; &s;ince in the&s;e a full ju&s;tification of her father's publick actings, and of his own, would be found, when &s;he &s;hould put them in the hands of one that could &s;et them in order, and in a due light. She put them all in my hands, which I acknowledge was a very great tru&s;t: And I made no ill u&s;e of it. I found there materials for a very large hi&s;tory. I writ it with great &s;incerity; and concealed none of their errors. I did indeed conceal &s;everal things that related to the King: I left out &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages that were in his letters; in &s;ome of which was too much weakne&s;s, and in others too much craft and an|ger. I got thro' that work in a few months. When the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> heard that I had fini&s;hed it, he de&s;ired me to come up to him; for he was &s;ure, he could both rectify many things, and enlarge on a great many more. His true de&s;ign was, to engage me to put in a great deal relating to him&s;elf in that work. I found another degree of kindne&s;s and confidence from him upon my coming up, than ever before. I had nothing to a&s;k for my &s;elf, but to be excu&s;ed from the offer of two Bi&s;hop|ricks. But what&s;oever I a&s;ked for any other per&s;on was granted: And I was con&s;idered as his favourite. He tru&s;ted me with all &s;ecrets, and &s;eemed to have no re&s;erves with me. He indeed pre&s;&s;ed me to give up with Sir <HI>Robert Murray:</HI> And I &s;aw, that upon my doing that I &s;hould have as much credit with him as I could de&s;ire. Sir <HI>Robert</HI> him&s;elf apprehended this would be
<PB N="299" REF="314">
put to me; and pre&s;&s;ed me to comply with him in it. But I hated &s;ervitude, as much as I loved him: So I refu&s;ed it flatly. I told Lord <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> that Sir <HI>Robert</HI> had been as a &s;econd father, or governour to me, and therefore I could not break friend&s;hip with him. But I promi&s;ed to &s;peak to him of nothing that he tru&s;ted to me. And this was all that ever he could bring me to, tho' he put it often to me. I was treated by him with an entire confidence. Applications were made to me: And eve|ry thing that I propo&s;ed was done. I laid before him the ill &s;tate the affairs of <HI>Scotland</HI> were falling into, by his throwing off &s;o many of his friends. Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> and he had been for &s;ome years in ill terms. I laid down a method for bringing them to a better under&s;tanding. I got kind letters to pa&s;s on both &s;ides, and put their reconciliation in &s;o fair a way, that upon my return to <HI>Scotland</HI> it was for that time fully made up. I had authority from him to try, how both the Earls of <HI>Argile,</HI> and <HI>Tweedale,</HI> might return to their old friend&s;hip with him. The Earl of <HI>Argile</HI> was ready to do every thing. But the Earl of <HI>Athol</HI> had propo&s;ed a match between his &s;on and Lady <HI>Dy&s;ert</HI>'s daugh|ter, and he had an hereditary hatred to the Lord <HI>Argile</HI> and his family: So that could not be ea&s;ily brought about. Lord <HI>Twee|dale</HI> was re&s;olved to withdraw from bu&s;ine&s;s. The Earl of <HI>Lau|derdale</HI> had for many years treated his brother the Lord <HI>Halton</HI> with as much contempt as he de&s;erved; for he was both weak and violent, in&s;olent and corrupt. He had promi&s;ed to &s;ettle his e&s;tate on his daughter, when the Lord <HI>Tweedale</HI>'s &s;on mar|ried her. But his brother offered now every thing that Lady <HI>Dy|&s;ert</HI> de&s;ired, provided &s;he would get his brother to &s;ettle his e&s;tate on him. So Lord <HI>Halton</HI> was now taken into affairs; and had &s;o much credit with his brother, that all the dependance was upon him. And thus the breach between the Earls of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> and <HI>Tweedale</HI> was irreconcileable; tho' I did all I could to make it up.</P>
<P>As to Church affairs, Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> a&s;ked my opinion con|cerning them. I gave it frankly to this purpo&s;e: There were <NOTE PLACE="marg">A farther In|dulgence propo&s;ed.</NOTE> many vacances in the di&s;affected Counties, to which no con|formable men of any worth could be prevailed on to go: So I propo&s;ed, that the Indulgence &s;hould be extended to them all; and that the Mini&s;ters &s;hould be put into tho&s;e pari&s;hes by cou|ples, and have the benefice divided between them; and, in the Churches where the Indulgence had already taken place, that a &s;econd Mini&s;ter &s;hould be added, and have the half of the benefice: By this means I reckoned, that all the outed Mini&s;ters would be again employed, and kept from going round the uninfected parts of the Kingdom: I al&s;o propo&s;ed that they

&s;hould be confined to their pari&s;hes, not to &s;tir out of them without leave from the Bi&s;hop of the dioce&s;e, or a Privy Coun|&s;ellour; and that, upon tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the rules that &s;hould be &s;et them, a proportion of their benefice &s;hould be forfeited, and applied to &s;ome pious u&s;e. Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> heard me to an end: And then, without arguing one word upon any one branch of this &s;cheme, he de&s;ired me to put it in wri|ting; which I did. And the next year, when he came down again to <HI>Scotland,</HI> he made one write out my paper, and turned it into the &s;tyle of in&s;tructions. So ea&s;ily did he let him&s;elf be go|verned by tho&s;e whom he tru&s;ted, even in matters of great con|&s;equence. Four Bi&s;hops happened to die that year, of which <HI>Edenburgh</HI> was one. I was de&s;ired to make my own choice: But I refu&s;ed them all. Yet I obtained a letter to be writ, by the King's order, to Lord <HI>Rothes,</HI> that he &s;hould call the two Archbi&s;hops, and four of the Officers of State, and &s;end up their opinion to the King of the per&s;ons fit to be promoted: And a private letter was writ to the Lords, to join with <HI>Leightoun</HI> in recommending the per&s;ons that he &s;hould name. <HI>Leightoun</HI> was unea&s;y, when he found that <HI>Charteris,</HI> and <HI>Nairn,</HI> as well as my &s;elf, could not be prevailed on to accept Bi&s;hopricks. They had an ill opinion of the Court, and could not be brought to leave their retirement. <HI>Leightoun</HI> was troubled at this. He &s;aid, if his friends left the whole load on him, he mu&s;t leave all to providence. Yet he named the be&s;t men he could think on. And, that <HI>Sharp</HI> might not have too publick an affront put on him, <HI>Leightoun</HI> agreed to one of his nomination. But now I go to open a &s;cene of another nature.</P>
<P>The Court was now going into other mea&s;ures. The Parli|ament <NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign af|fairs.</NOTE> had given the King all the money he had a&s;ked for re|pairing his fleet, and for &s;upplying his &s;tores and magazines. Additional revenues were al&s;o given for &s;ome years. But at their <NOTE PLACE="marg">An alliance with <HI>France</HI> &s;et on foot.</NOTE> la&s;t &s;itting, in the beginning of the year 1670, it appeared that the Hou&s;e of Commons were out of countenance for having giv|en &s;o much money, and &s;eemed re&s;olved to give no more. All was obtained under the pretence of maintaining the Triple Alli|ance. When the Court &s;aw how little rea&s;on they had to ex|pect farther &s;upplies, the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> told the King, that now the time was come in which he might both revenge the attempt on <HI>Chatham,</HI> and &s;hake off the unea&s;y re&s;traint of a Hou&s;e of Commons. And he got leave from the King to &s;end over Sir <HI>Ellis Leightoun</HI> to the Court of <HI>France,</HI> to offer the project of a new alliance, and a new war. Sir <HI>Ellis</HI> told m$ this him&s;elf: And was proud to think, that he was the fir&s;t man
<PB N="301" REF="316">
employed in tho&s;e black and fatal de&s;igns. But, in the fir&s;t pro|po&s;ition made by us, the &s;ubduing of <HI>England,</HI> and the tolerati|on of Poperty, here was offered, as that with which the de&s;ign mu&s;t be begun. <HI>France,</HI> &s;eeing <HI>England</HI> &s;o inclined, re&s;olved to pu&s;h the matter farther.</P>
<P>The King's &s;i&s;ter, the Duche&s;s of <HI>Orleans,</HI> was thought the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duch|e&s;s of <HI>Orle|ans</HI> $$me to <HI>Dover.</HI></NOTE> wittie&s;t woman in <HI>France.</HI> The King of <HI>France</HI> had made love to her, with which &s;he was highly incen&s;ed, when &s;he &s;aw it was only a pretence to cover his addre&s;&s;es to <HI>Madamoi&s;elle La Valiere,</HI> one of her maids of honour, whom he afterwards declared open|ly to be his Mi&s;tri&s;s: Yet &s;he had reconciled her &s;elf to the King; and was now &s;o entirely tru&s;ted by him, that he ordered her to propo&s;e an interview with her brother at <HI>Dover.</HI> The King went thither, and was &s;o much charmed with his &s;i&s;ter, that every thing &s;he propo&s;ed, and every favour &s;he a&s;ked, was grant|ed. The King could deny her nothing. She propo&s;ed an alli|ance in order to the conque&s;t of <HI>Holland.</HI> The King had a mind to have begun at home. But &s;he diverted him from that. It could not be fore&s;een, what difficulties the King might meet with upon the fir&s;t opening the de&s;ign: As it would alarm all his people, &s;o it would &s;end a great deal of wealth, and trade, and perhaps much people over to <HI>Holland:</HI> And by &s;uch an ac|ce&s;&s;ion they would grow &s;tronger, as he would grow weaker. So &s;he propo&s;ed, that they &s;hould begin with <HI>Holland,</HI> and at|tack it vigorou&s;ly, both by &s;ea and land: And upon their &s;uc|ce&s;s in that, all the re&s;t would be an ea&s;y work. This account of that negotiation was printed twelve years after, at <HI>Paris,</HI> by one Abbot <HI>Primi.</HI> I had that part of the book in my hands, in which this was contained. Lord <HI>Pre&s;toil</HI> was then the King's En|voy at <HI>Paris:</HI> So he, knowing how great a prejudice the publi&s;hing this would be to his ma&s;ter's affairs, complained of it. The book was upon that &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and the writer was put in the <HI>Ba&s;tille.</HI> But he had drawn it out of the papers of Mr. <HI>Le Tel|lier</HI>'s office: So there is little rea&s;on to doubt of the truth of the thing. <HI>Madame,</HI> as this book &s;ays, prevailed to have her &s;cheme &s;ettled, and &s;o went back to <HI>France.</HI> The journey proved fatal to her: For the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> had heard &s;uch things of her behaviour, that it was &s;aid he ordered a great do&s;e of &s;ublimate <NOTE PLACE="marg">Soon after was p$y$span$. $word$</NOTE> to be given her in a gla&s;s of &s;uccory-water, of which &s;he died a few hours after in great torments: And when &s;he was opened, her &s;tomach was all ulcerated.</P>
<P>Since I mention her death, I will &s;et down one &s;tory of her, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some of $span$gu$$</NOTE> that was told me by a per&s;on of di&s;tinction, who had it from &s;ome who were well informed of the matter. The King of
<PB N="302" REF="317">
<HI>France</HI> had courted Madame <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> and made a &s;hew of court|ing <HI>Madame.</HI> But his affections fixing on <HI>Madamoi&s;elle La Vali|ere,</HI> &s;he whom he had for&s;aken, as well as &s;he whom he had de|ceived, re&s;olved to be revenged: And they entred into a friend|&s;hip in order to that. They had each of them a Gallant: <HI>Ma|dame</HI> had the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> and the other had the Marqui&s;s <HI>Des Vardes,</HI> then in great favour with the King, and a very graceful per&s;on. When the treaty of the King of <HI>France</HI>'s mar|riage was &s;et on foot, there was an opinion generally received, that the Infanta of <HI>Spain</HI> was a woman of great genius, and would have a con&s;iderable &s;troke in all affairs. So, many young men of Quality &s;et them&s;elves to learn the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> language, to give them the more credit with the young Queen. All that fell to the ground, when it appeared how weak a woman &s;he was. The&s;e two were of that number. Count <HI>De Guiche</HI> watch|ed an occa&s;ion, when a letter from the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was giv|en to his daughter by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, and &s;he tore the envelope, and let it fall. He gathered up all the parcels of it, together with the &s;eal. From the&s;e they learnt to imitate the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s writing. And they &s;ent to <HI>Holland</HI> to get a &s;eal engraven from the impre&s;&s;ion of the wax. When all was prepared, a letter was writ, as in the name of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> reproaching his daughter for her tamene&s;s in &s;uffering &s;uch an affront as the King put on her by his amours, with reflexions full both of contempt and anger upon the King. There was one <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Lady left about the Queen: So they forged ano|ther <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some of the intrigues.</NOTE> letter, as from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour to her, with that to the Queen inclo&s;ed in it, de&s;iring her to deliver it &s;ecretly into the Queen's own hand. And they made a livery, &s;uch as the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour's pages wore: And a boy was &s;ent in it with the letter. The Lady &s;u&s;pected no forgery; but fancied, the letter might be about &s;ome matter of State. She thought it &s;afe&s;t to carry it to the King, who reading it ordered an enqui|ry to be made about it. The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour &s;aw he was abu&s;ed in it. The King &s;poke to the Marquis <HI>Des Vardes,</HI> not &s;u&s;pecting that he was in it, and charged him to &s;earch after the authour of this abu&s;e that was intended to be put on him. The two Ladies now rejoyced, that the looking after the di&s;co|very was put in the hands of a man &s;o much concerned in it. He amu&s;ed the King with the enquiries that he was making, tho' he was ever in a wrong &s;eent. But in all this time <HI>Madame</HI> was &s;o plea&s;ed with his conduct, that &s;he came to like his per|&s;on; and had &s;o little command of her &s;elf, that &s;he told Ma|dame <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> &s;he was her rival. The other readily complied
<PB N="303" REF="318">
with her. And, by an odd piece of extravagance, he was &s;ent for: And Madam <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons</HI> told him, &s;ince he was in <HI>Madame</HI>'s favour, &s;he relea&s;ed him from all obligations, and delivered him over to her. The Marquis <HI>Des Vardes</HI> thought, this was only an artifice of gallantry, to try how faithful he was to his amours: So he declared him&s;elf incapable of changing, in terms full of re&s;pect for <HI>Madame,</HI> and of pa&s;&s;ion for the other. This rai&s;ed in <HI>Ma|dame</HI> &s;o deep a re&s;entment, that &s;he re&s;olved to &s;acrifice <HI>Des Var|des,</HI> but to &s;ave the Count <HI>De Guiche.</HI> So &s;he gave him notice, that the King had di&s;covered the whole intrigue; and charged him to ha&s;ten out of <HI>France.</HI> And, as &s;oon as &s;he believed that he was in <HI>Flanders,</HI> &s;he told all to the King of <HI>France.</HI> Upon which <HI>Des Vardes</HI> was not only di&s;graced, but kept long a pri&s;oner in <HI>Ai|gues Mortes.</HI> And afterwards he was &s;uffered to come to <HI>Mon|pelier.</HI> And it was almo&s;t twenty years after, before he was &s;uf|fered to come to Court. I was at Court when he came fir&s;t to it. He was much broke in his health, but was become a philo&s;o|pher, and was in great reputation among all <HI>Des Cartes</HI>'s followers. <HI>Madame</HI> had an Intrigue with another per&s;on, whom I knew well, the Count of <HI>Treville.</HI> When &s;he was in her agony, &s;he &s;aid, <HI>adieu Treville.</HI> He was &s;o &s;truck with this accident, that it had a good effect on him; for he went and lived many years among the Fathers of the Oratory, and became both a very learned, and devout man. He came afterwards out into the world. I &s;aw him often. He was a man of a very &s;weet temper, only a little too formal for a <HI>French</HI> man. But he was very &s;incere. He was a Jan&s;eni&s;t. He hated the Je&s;uits. And had a very mean opinion of the King, which appeared in all the in&s;tances, in which it was &s;afe for him to &s;hew it.</P>
<P>Upon <HI>Madame</HI>'s death, as the Mar&s;hal <HI>Bellefonds</HI> came from <NOTE PLACE="marg">The treaty with <HI>France</HI> negotiated</NOTE> <HI>France</HI> with the complement to the Court of <HI>England,</HI> &s;o the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was &s;ent thither on pretence to return the complement, but really to fini&s;h the treaty. The King of <HI>France</HI> u&s;ed him in &s;o particular a manner, knowing his vanity, and ca|re&s;&s;ed him to &s;uch a degree, that he went in without re&s;erve into the intere&s;ts of <HI>France.</HI> Yet he prote&s;ted to me, that he never con&s;ented to the <HI>French</HI> fleet's coming into our &s;eas and harbours. He &s;aid, he was offered 40000 <HI>l.</HI> if he could per&s;uade the King to yield to it: And he appealed to the Earl of <HI>Dor&s;et</HI> for this, who was on the &s;ecret. He therefore concluded, &s;ince, after all the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;hewed at fir&s;t, the King had yielded to it, that Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> had the money. Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> laid the blame of this chiefly on the Duke of <HI>Buckingham:</HI> For he told me, that he him&s;elf had writ a peremptory in&s;truction to
<PB N="304" REF="319">
him from the King, to give up all treaty, if the <HI>French</HI> did in|&s;i&s;t on the &s;ending a fleet to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance. And therefore he blamed him, as having yielded it up, &s;ince he ought to have broke off all farther treaty, upon their in&s;i&s;ting on this. But the Duke of <HI>York</HI> told me, there was no money given to corrupt the King's Mini&s;ters; that the King and he had long in&s;i&s;ted on having all their &s;upplies from <HI>France</HI> in money, without a fleet; and that the <HI>French</HI> &s;hewed them it was not po&s;&s;ible for them to find out funds for &s;o great an expence, unle&s;s we took a &s;qua|dron of their &s;hips; &s;ince they could not both maintain their own fleet, and furni&s;h us with the money that would be nece&s;|&s;ary, if we took not their &s;quadron. It was agreed, that the King &s;hould have 350000 <HI>l.</HI> a year during the war, together with a fleet from <HI>France&punc; England</HI> was to attack the <HI>Dutch</HI> by &s;ea, while the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;hould invade them by land with a mighty Army. It was not doubted, but that the States would find it impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t &s;o great a force, and would therefore &s;ubmit to the two Kings: So the divi&s;ion they agreed on was, that <HI>England</HI> &s;hould have <HI>Zealand,</HI> and that the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;hould have all the re&s;t, except <HI>Holland,</HI> which was to be given to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> if he would come into the alliance: And it &s;hould be &s;till a trading country, but without any capi|tal &s;hips. Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> &s;aid upon that occa&s;ion to me, that what&s;oever they intended to do, they were re&s;olved to do it ef|fectually all at once: But he would not go into farther particulars. That the year 1672 might be fatal to other Common-wealths, as well as to the States, the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> was encouraged to make a conque&s;t of <HI>Genoa;</HI> tho he afterwards failed in the at|tempt: And the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> was invited into the alliance, with the offer of the town of <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> on which he had long &s;et his heart. The Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> was &s;ent to give a lu&s;tre to that negotiation, which was chiefly managed by Mr. <HI>$$$&s;haw;</HI> who told me, that we offered that King &s;ome &s;hips to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in &s;eizing that rich town. But he was then in tho&s;e engagements with the Sates of <HI>Holland,</HI> that even this offer did not prevail on him.</P>
<P><HI>$span$art</HI> was at this time brought to Court by Lord <HI>Lauder|dale,</HI> hoping that he would continue in an entire dependance on him, and be his creature. He was under &s;o great a jealou&s;y from the Government for his former actings, that he was too ea&s;y to enter into any employment, that might bring him into favour, not &s;o much out of any ambition to ri&s;e, as from a de&s;ire to be &s;afe, and to be no longer looked on as an enemy to the Court: For when a foreign Mini&s;ter a&s;ked the King's leave to treat with
<PB N="305" REF="320">
him in his ma&s;ter's name, the King con&s;ented; but with this &s;evere reflexion, that he believed he would be true to any body but him&s;elf. He was &s;ent to the Courts of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> and <HI>Lunenburgh,</HI> either to draw them into the alliance, or, if that could not be done, at lea&s;t to &s;ecure them from all apprehen&s;i|ons. But in this he had no &s;ucce&s;s. And indeed when he &s;aw into what a negotiation he was engaged, he became very unea|&s;y: For, tho' the blacke&s;t part of the &s;ecret was not tru&s;ted to him, as appeared to me by his in&s;tructions, which I read after his death; yet he &s;aw whither things were going. And that affected him &s;o deeply, that it was believed to have contributed not a little to the langui&s;hing he &s;oon fell under, which ended in his death two years after.</P>
<P>The war being thus re&s;olved on, &s;ome pretences were in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pretended rea&s;ons for the <HI>Dutch</HI> war.</NOTE> next place to be &s;ought out to excu&s;e it: For, tho' the King of <HI>France</HI> went more roundly to work, and publi&s;hed that he was &s;o ill &s;atisfied with the conduct of the States, that it did not con|&s;i&s;t with his glory to bear it any longer, yet we thought it de|cent for us to name &s;ome particulars. It was &s;aid, we had &s;ome preten&s;ions on <HI>Surinam,</HI> not yet compleatly &s;atisfied; and that the States harboured traitors, that fled from ju&s;tice, and lived in <HI>Holland:</HI> Some medals were complained of, that &s;eemed di&s;|honourable to the King; as al&s;o &s;ome pictures: And, tho' the&s;e were not made by publick order, yet a great noi&s;e was rai&s;ed about them. But an accident happened, that the Court laid great hold of. The <HI>Dutch</HI> fleet lay off the coa&s;t of <HI>Eng|land</HI> the former year: And one of the King's Yatchs &s;ailed by, and expected they &s;hould &s;trike &s;ail. They &s;aid, they ne|ver refu&s;ed it to any man of war: But they thought that honour did not belong to &s;uch an incon&s;iderable ve&s;&s;el. I was then at Court: And I &s;aw joy in the looks of tho&s;e that were in the &s;e|cret. <HI>Selden</HI> had in his <HI>Mare clau&s;um</HI> rai&s;ed this matter &s;o high, that he made it one of the chief rights and honours of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> as the acknowledgement of the King's Em|pire in the four &s;eas. The <HI>Dutch</HI> offered all &s;atisfaction for the future in this matter: But they would not &s;end their Admi|ral over as a criminal. While <HI>France</HI> was treating with <HI>England,</HI> they continued to amu&s;e the <HI>Dutch:</HI> And they &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>De Groot,</HI> then the <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Paris,</HI> or they corrupted him into a belief that they had no de&s;ign on them, that they were too &s;ecure, and depended too much on his adverti&s;ements. Yet the States entred into a negotiation, both with <HI>Spain</HI> and the Emperour, and with the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> the Flector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Lunenburgh.</HI> The King of
<PB N="306" REF="321">
<HI>Sweden</HI> was yet under age: And the Mini&s;try there de&s;ired a neu|trality. <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> &s;ent two Amba&s;&s;adors to them, both men of great probity, <HI>Pompone</HI> and <HI>Coventry,</HI> who were both recalled at the &s;ame time to be Secretaries of State. <HI>Co|ventry</HI> was a man of wit and hear, of &s;pirit and candor. He ne|ver gave bad advices: But when the King followed the ill ad|vices that others gave, he thought him&s;elf bound to excu&s;e, if not to ju&s;tify them. For this the Duke of <HI>York</HI> commended him much to me. He &s;aid, in that he was a pattern to all good &s;ubjects, &s;ince he defended all the King's coun&s;els in publick, even when he had blamed them mo&s;t in private with the King him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Our Court having re&s;olved on a war, did now look out for <NOTE PLACE="marg">1672. Th$&s;hu$span$ the E$span$quer.</NOTE> money to carry it on. The King had been running into a great debt ever &s;ince his Re&s;toration. One branch of it was for the pay of that fleet that brought him over. The main of it had been contracted during the former <HI>Dutch</HI> war. The King in order to the keeping his credit had dealt with &s;ome Bankers, and had a&s;&s;igned over the revenue to them. They drove a great trade, and had made great advantage by it. The King paid them at the rate of 8 <HI>per cent:</HI> And they paid tho&s;e who put money in their hands only 6 <HI>per cent:</HI> And had great credit; for pay|ments were made very punctually. The King had in &s;ome pro|clamations given his faith, that he would continue to make good all his a&s;&s;ignments, till the whole debt &s;hould be paid, which was now growing up to almo&s;t a million and a half. So one of the ways propo&s;ed for &s;upplying the King with money was, that he &s;hould &s;top the&s;e payments for a year, it being thought cer|tain that by the end of the year the King would be out of all his ne|ce&s;&s;ities, by the hopes they had of &s;ucce&s;s in the war. The Earl of <HI>Shalisbury</HI> was the chief man in this advice. He excu&s;ed it to me, telling me what advantage the Bankers had made, and how ju&s;t it was for the King to bring them to an account for their u&s;ury and extortions: And added, that he never meant the &s;top &s;hould run beyond the year. He certainly knew of it before hand; and took all his own money out of the Bankers hands, and warned &s;ome of his friends to do the like. Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> did about this time marry Lady <HI>Dy&s;ert</HI> upon his own Lady's death: And &s;he writ me a long account of the &s;hutting up the Exchequer, as both ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary. The Bankers were broke; and great multitudes, who had tru&s;ted their money in their hands, were ruined by this di&s;honourable and perfidious
<PB N="307" REF="322">
action. But this gave the King only his own revenue again. So other ways were to be found for an encrea&s;e of trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>By the peace of <HI>Breda</HI> it was provided, that, in order to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The attempt on the <HI>Dutch Smyrna</HI> fleet.</NOTE> &s;ecurity of trade, no merchant's &s;hips &s;hould be for the future fallen on, till &s;ix months after a declaration of war. The <HI>Dutch</HI> had a rich fleet coming from <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and other parts in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> under the convoy of a few men of war. Our Court had advice of this. And <HI>Holmes</HI> was ordered to lye for them, and to take them near the I&s;le of <HI>Wight</HI> with eight men of war. As he was &s;ailing thither he met <HI>Spragge,</HI> who was returning from the <HI>Straits</HI> with a &s;quadron of our &s;hips; and told him, that he had &s;ailed along with the <HI>Dutch</HI> mo&s;t of the way, and that they would pa&s;s within a day or two. <HI>Holmes</HI> thought, he was much too &s;trong for them; &s;o did not ac|quaint <HI>Spragge</HI> with his de&s;ign: For, if he had &s;topp'd him to a&s;|&s;i&s;t in the execution, probably the whole fleet had been taken, which was reckoned worth a million and a half. When they came up, <HI>Holmes</HI> fell upon them: But their convoy did their part &s;o well, that not only the whole fleet &s;ailed away, while they kept him in play, but they them&s;elves got off at la&s;t fa|voured by a mi&s;t: And there were only a few &s;hips taken, of &s;o &s;mall a value, that they were not worth the powder that was &s;pent in the action. This was a breach of faith, &s;uch as even Mahometans and Pyrates would have been a&s;hamed of. The un|&s;ucce&s;sfulne&s;s of it made it appear as ridiculous, as it was ba&s;e. <HI>Holmes</HI> was pre&s;&s;ed to put it on the <HI>Dutch</HI> refu&s;ing to &s;trike $ail. Yet that was &s;o fal&s;e, and there were &s;o many witne&s;&s;es to it, that he had not the impudence to affirm it.</P>
<P>To crown all, a Declaration was ordered to be &s;et out, &s;u&s;pen|ding <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Declarati|on for $ole|ration.</NOTE> the execution of all penal laws, both again&s;t Papi&s;ts and Nonconformi&s;ts. Papi&s;ts were no more to be pro&s;ecuted for their way of wor&s;hip in their own hou&s;es, and the Nonconformi&s;ts were allowed to have open Meeting Hou&s;es; for which they were to take out licences, and none were to di&s;turb tho&s;e who &s;hould meet for wor&s;hip by virtue of tho&s;e licences. Lord Kee|per <HI>Bridgman</HI> had lo&s;t all credit at Court: So they were &s;eeking an occa&s;ion to be rid of him, who had indeed lo&s;t all the repu|tation he had formerly acquired, by his being advanc'd to a po&s;t of which he was not capable. He refu&s;ed to put the &s;eal to the Declaration, as judging it contrary to law. So he was di&s;mi&s;s'd, and the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> was made Lord Chancellour. Lord <HI>Clifford</HI> was made Lord Trea&s;urer: Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> and Lord <HI>Lauderdale</HI> had both of them the Garter: And, as <HI>Arlington</HI> was made an Earl, <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was made a Duke: And this <HI>Junto,</HI> together with the
<PB N="308" REF="323">
Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> being called the Cabal, it was ob&s;erved, that Cabal proved a technical word, every letter in it being the fir&s;t letter of tho&s;e five, <HI>Clifford, A&s;hly, Buckingham, Arlington,</HI> and <HI>Lauderdale.</HI> They had all of them great pre&s;ents from <HI>France,</HI> be&s;ides what was openly given them: For the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dour gave them all a picture of the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;et in dia|monds, to the value of 3000 <HI>l.</HI> Thus was the Nation, and our religion, as well as the King's faith and honour, &s;et to &s;ale, and &s;old. Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> re&s;olved to recommend him&s;elf to the confidence of the Court by a new &s;train never before thought of. He &s;aid, the writs for choo&s;ing the members of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons might be i&s;&s;ued out in the intervals of a &s;e&s;&s;ion; and the elections made upon them were to be returned into Chancery, and &s;ettled there. So the writs were i&s;&s;ued out, but whether any elec|tions were made upon them, and returned, I cannot tell. I know, the Hou&s;e of Commons intended to have impeached him for this among other things: But he had the fore&s;ight and &s;kill to prevent it. When the Declaration for Toleration was publi&s;hed, great endeavours were u&s;ed by the Court to per&s;uade the Nonconfor|mi&s;ts to make addre&s;&s;es and complements upon it. But few were &s;o blind, as not to &s;ee what was aimed at by it.</P>
<P>The Duke was now known to be a Papi&s;t: And the Duche&s;s <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Presby|terians gave the King thanks for the $olera|tion</NOTE> was much &s;u&s;pected. Yet the Presbyterians came in a body: And Dr. <HI>Manton</HI> in their name thanked the King for it, which of|fended many of their be&s;t friends. There was al&s;o an order, to pay a yearly pen&s;ion of fifty pounds to mo&s;t of them, and of an hundred pounds a year to the chief of the party. <HI>Baxter</HI> &s;ent back his pen&s;ion, and would not touch it. But mo&s;t of them took it. All this I &s;ay upon Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI>'s, word who a&s;&s;ured me, he knew the truth of it. And in particular, he told me, that <HI>Pool,</HI> who wrote the Synop&s;is of the criticks, confe&s;&s;ed to him, that he had had fifty pounds for two years. Thus the Court hired them to be &s;ilent: And the greate&s;t part of them were &s;o, and very compliant. But now the pulpits were full of a new &s;train: Popery was every where preached again&s;t, and the authority of the laws was much magnified. The Bi&s;hops, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lon|don</HI> in particular, charged the Clergy to preach again&s;t Popery, and to inform the people of the controver&s;y between us and the Church of Rome. This alarmed the Court, as well as the City, and the whole Nation. <HI>Clifford</HI> began to &s;hew the heat of his temper; and &s;eemed a &s;ort of Enthu&s;ia&s;t for Popery. The King complained to <HI>Sheldon</HI> of this preaching on controver&s;y, as done on purpo&s;e to inflame the people, and to alienate them from him, and his government. Upon this <HI>Sheldon</HI> called &s;ome of the Cler-gy
<PB N="309" REF="324">
together to con&s;ider what an&s;wer he &s;hould make the King; if he pre&s;&s;ed him any farther on that head. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> was one of the&s;e: And he &s;ugge&s;ted this an&s;wer, that, &s;ince the King him|&s;elf profe&s;&s;ed the Prote&s;tant religion, it would be a thing with|out a precedent, that he &s;hould forbid his Clergy to preach in defence of a religion which they believed, while he him&s;elf &s;aid he was of it. But the King never renewed the motion.</P>
<P>While things were in this fermentation, the Duche&s;s of <HI>York</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Du|che&s;s of <HI>York</HI> died</NOTE> died. It was ob&s;erved, that for fifteen months before that time &s;he had not received the &s;acrament; and that upon all occa&s;i|ons &s;he was excu&s;ing the errours that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> was charged with, and was giving them the be&s;t colours they were capable of. An unmarried Clergy was al&s;o a common topick with her. <HI>Morly</HI> had been her father confe&s;&s;our: For, he told me, &s;he practi&s;ed &s;ecret confe&s;&s;ion to him from the time that &s;he was twelve years old: And, when he was &s;ent away from the Court, he put her in the hands of <HI>Blanford,</HI> who died Bi&s;hop of <HI>Worce&s;ter. Morley</HI> al&s;o told me, that upon the reports that were brought him of her &s;lackne&s;s in receiving the &s;acrament, &s;he having been for many years punctual to once a month, he had &s;poken plainly to her about it, and told her what inferences were made upon it. She pretended ill health, and bu&s;ine&s;s; but prote&s;ted to him, &s;he had no &s;cruples with relation to her religion, and was &s;till of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and a&s;&s;ured him, that no Popi&s;h Prie&s;t had ever taken the confidence to &s;peak to her of tho&s;e matters. He took a &s;olemn engagement of her, that, if &s;cruples &s;hould ari&s;e in her mind, &s;he would let him know them, and hear what he &s;hould offer to her upon all of them. And he prote&s;ted to me, that to her death &s;he never owned to him that &s;he had any &s;cruples, tho' &s;he was for &s;ome days entertained by him at <HI>Farn|ham,</HI> after the date of the paper which was afterwards publi&s;hed in her name. All this pa&s;s'd between the Bi&s;hop and me, upon the Duke's &s;hewing me that paper all writ in her own hand, which was afterwards publi&s;hed by <HI>Maimburg.</HI> He would not let me take a copy of it; but he gave me leave to read it twice. And I went immediately to <HI>Morley,</HI> and gave him an account of it; from whom I had all the particulars already mentioned. And upon that he concluded, that that unhappy Prince&s;s had been prevail|ed on to give fal&s;ewoods under her hand, and to pretend that the&s;e were the grounds of her conver&s;ion. A long decay of health came at la&s;t to a quicker cri&s;is than had been apprehended. All of the &s;udden &s;he fell into the agony of death. <HI>Blanford</HI> was &s;ent for, to prepare her for it, and to offer her the &s;acrament. Before he could come, the Queen came in, and &s;at by her. He was
<PB N="310" REF="325">
mode&s;t and humble, even to a fault. So he had not pre&s;ence of mind enough to begin prayers, which probably would have driven the Queen out of the room. But, that not being done, &s;he pretending kindne&s;s would not leave her. The Bi&s;hop &s;poke but little and fearfully. He happened to &s;ay, he hoped &s;he con|tinued &s;till in the truth: Upon which &s;he a&s;ked, what is truth: And then, her agony encrea&s;ing, &s;he repeated the word Truth Truth often: And in a few minutes after &s;he died, very little beloved, or lamented. Her haughtine&s;s had rai&s;ed her many enemies. She was indeed a firm, and a kind friend: But the change of her re|ligion made her friends reckon her death rather a ble&s;&s;ing than a lo&s;s at that time to them all. Her father, when he heard of her &s;haking in her religion, was more troubled at it, than at all his own misfortunes. He writ her a very grave and long letter upon it, enclo&s;ed in one to the Duke. But &s;he was dead before it came into <HI>England.</HI> I have &s;et down all that I know concern|ing the fatal alliance with <HI>France,</HI> and our preparations for the &s;econd Dutch War.</P>
<P>But that I may open the &s;cene more di&s;tinctly, I will give as particular an account as I was able to gather of the affairs of the States of <HI>Holland</HI> at this time. And, becau&s;e this was the fifth great cri&s;is, under which the whole Prote&s;tant religion was brought, I will lead my reader thro' a full account of them all; &s;ince I may probably lay things before him, that he may other|wi&s;e pa&s;s over, without making due reflections on them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t cri&s;is was, when <HI>Charles</HI> V. by the defeating the Duke <NOTE PLACE="marg">The fir&s;t cri&s;is of the Prote&s;tant religion.</NOTE> of <HI>Saxony,</HI> and the getting him and the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> in|to his hands, had &s;ubdued the <HI>Smalcaldick</HI> league; in which the &s;trength of the Prote&s;tant religion did then con&s;i&s;t, having been weakened by the &s;ucceeding deaths of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and <HI>Francis</HI> I. Upon that defeat all &s;ubmitted to the Emperor: Only the Town of <HI>Magdeburgh</HI> &s;tood out. The Emperor &s;hould either not have tru&s;ted <HI>Maurice,</HI> or have u&s;ed him better: And it &s;eems, that he reckoned <HI>Maurice</HI> had neither religion nor honour, &s;ince his ambition had made him betray his religion, and abandon his party. When <HI>Maurice</HI> had got the Electorate, he made him|&s;elf &s;ure of the Army; and entred into an alliance with <HI>France,</HI> and other Princes of the Empire; and made &s;o quick a turn on the Emperor, that he had almo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed him at <HI>Inch&s;pruck,</HI> and of a &s;udden overturned all that de&s;ign, upon which the Em|peror had been labouring for many years. This ended in the Edict of <HI>Pa&s;&s;an,</HI> which &s;ettled the peace of <HI>Germany</HI> for that time.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="326">
The &s;econd Cri&s;is was, towards the end of Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s reign, when the Prote&s;tant religion &s;eemed extingui&s;hed in <HI>England;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;econd Cri&s;is.</NOTE> and the two Cardinals of <HI>Lorrain</HI> and <HI>Granvell,</HI> then the chief Mini&s;ters of the two Crowns, de&s;igned a peace for that very end, that their ma&s;ters might be at lei&s;ure to extirpate here&s;y, which was then &s;preading in both their dominions. But, after they had formed their &s;cheme, Queen <HI>Mary</HI> died, and was &s;uc|ceeded by Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> Soon after that the King of <HI>France</HI> was accidentally killed: So that Kingdom fell under a long continuance of a minority, and a civil war. And the <HI>Netherlands</HI> felt from thence, and from <HI>England,</HI> &s;uch en|couragement, that they made the longe&s;t and brave&s;t re&s;i&s;tance that is to be found in all hi&s;tory; which was in a great mea&s;ure owing to the ob&s;tinate and implacable cruelty of <HI>Philip</HI> II, and his great di&s;tance from the &s;cene of the war; and was pa&s;t all po&s;&s;ibility of being made up, by rea&s;on of his per&s;idious breach of all agreements, and his u&s;ing tho&s;e that &s;erved him well in &s;o ba&s;e a manner, as he did both the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Parma.</HI></P>
<P>The third Cri&s;is la&s;ted from 1585 to the year 1589. Then <NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Cri&s;is.</NOTE> began the League of <HI>France.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Parma</HI> was victori|ous in the <HI>Netherlands.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was murdered. The States fell under great di&s;tractions. And <HI>Spain</HI> entered into a de&s;ign of dethroning the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> and putting the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> in her &s;tead. In order to that they were for &s;ome years preparing the greate&s;t fleet that the world had ever &s;een, which came to be called the Invincible Armada. All <HI>Eu|rope</HI> was amazed at the&s;e great preparations: And many conjec|tures were made concerning the de&s;ign of &s;uch a va&s;t fleet. Some thought of <HI>Con&s;tantinople.</HI> Others talked of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> in con|junction with the Emperor of the <HI>Abi&s;&s;ens.</HI> But that which was mo&s;t probable was, that King <HI>Philip</HI> intended to make a great effort, and put an end to the war of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> in one campaign. At la&s;t the true intent of it was found out. <HI>Wal|&s;ingham</HI>'s chief &s;pies were Prie&s;ts: As he u&s;ed always to &s;ay, an active, but vicious, Prie&s;t was the be&s;t &s;py in the world. By one of the&s;e he had advice, that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had fixed on a re&s;olution with relation to his fleet; but that it was not yet communicated to any of his Mini&s;ters in foreign Courts. The King him&s;elf had indeed writ a letter about it to the Pope: But it was not entred in any office: So this was all that the intel|ligence from <HI>Madrid</HI> could di&s;cover. Upon this one was &s;ent to <HI>Venice,</HI> from whence the corre&s;pondence with <HI>Rome</HI> was herd. And at <HI>Rome</HI> it was found out, that one of the Popes chief
<PB N="312" REF="327">
confidents had a Mi&s;tri&s;s, to whom twenty thou&s;and crowns were given for a &s;ight and copy of that letter. The copy of it was &s;ent over &s;oon after <HI>Chri&s;tma&s;s,</HI> in the winter 1586. By it the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had acquainted the Pope, that the de&s;ign of his fleet was to land in <HI>England,</HI> to de&s;troy Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and here|&s;y, and to &s;et the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> on the throne: In this he had the concurrence of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Gui&s;e:</HI> And he al&s;o depended on the King of <HI>Scotland.</HI> This proved fatal to the Queen of <HI>Scots.</HI> It is true, King <HI>James</HI> &s;ent one <HI>Steward,</HI> the ance&s;tor of the Lord <HI>Blantyre,</HI> who was then of his bedchamber, with an earne&s;t and threatening me&s;&s;age to Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> for &s;aving his mother. But in one of the intercepted letters of the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours then in <HI>Scotland,</HI> found among <HI>Wal|&s;ingham</HI>'s papers, it appears, that the King, young as he was then, was either very double, or very incon&s;tant in his re|&s;olutions. The <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour a&s;&s;ured him, that <HI>Steward</HI> had advi&s;ed the Queen to put a &s;peedy end to that bu&s;ine&s;s, which way &s;he plea&s;ed; and that as for his ma&s;ter's anger, he would &s;oon be pacified, if &s;he would but &s;end him dogs and deer. The King was &s;o offended at this, that he &s;aid, he would hang him up in his boots, as &s;oon as he came back. Yet when he came back, it was &s;o far from that, that he lay all that night in the bedchamber. As for the pompous Emba&s;&s;y that was &s;ent from <HI>France</HI> to prote&s;t again&s;t it, <HI>Maurier</HI> has told a very probable &s;tory, of <HI>Henry</HI> III, writing a letter with them to the Queen, advi&s;ing her to proceed with all ha&s;te to do that which the Em|ba&s;&s;y was &s;ent to prevent. He &s;aw, the Hou&s;e of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> built a great part of their hopes on the pro&s;pect of their cou&s;in's com|ing to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> which would cut off all the hopes the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI> had of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from thence. I have &s;een an original letter of the Earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI>'s to the Earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> who had married his &s;i&s;ter, and was then Governour of <HI>Berwick,</HI> telling him, that, how high &s;oever the <HI>French</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;adours had talked in their harangues upon that occa&s;ion, calling any proceeding again&s;t the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> an open in|dignity, as well as an act of ho&s;tility again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> &s;ince &s;he was Queen <HI>Dowager</HI> of <HI>France;</HI> yet all this was only matter of form and decency, that was extorted from the King of <HI>France;</HI> and, how high &s;oever they might talk, they were well a&s;&s;ured he would do nothing upon it. So that unfortunate Queen fell at that time, by rea&s;on of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> preparations to conquer <HI>England,</HI> under the pretence of &s;etting her on the throne. She died, much more decently than &s;he had lived, in <HI>Febr.</HI> 1587.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="328">
But the Court of <HI>England</HI> &s;aw, that if King <HI>Philip</HI>'s fleet was in a condition to conquer <HI>England,</HI> he would not abandon the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> fleet came not as at fir&s;t intended.</NOTE> de&s;ign for her being put out of the way; and that he certainly intended to conquer it for him&s;elf, and not for another. So orders were given to make all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te with a fleet. Yet they were &s;o little provided for &s;uch an inva&s;ion, that, tho' they had then twenty good &s;hips upon the &s;tocks, it was not po&s;&s;ible to get them in a condition to &s;erve that &s;ummer: And the de&s;ign of <HI>Spain</HI> was to &s;ail over in 1587. So, unle&s;s by corruption, or any other method, the attempt could be put off for that year, there was no &s;trength ready to re&s;i&s;t &s;o powerful a fleet. But, when it &s;eemed not po&s;&s;ible to divert the pre&s;ent execution of &s;o great a de&s;ign, a merchant of <HI>London</HI> to their &s;urpri&s;e undertook it. He was well acquainted with the &s;tate of the revenue of <HI>Spain,</HI> with all their charge, and all that they could rai&s;e. He knew all their funds were &s;o &s;wallowed up, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to victual, and &s;et out their fleet, but by their credit in the bank of <HI>Genoa.</HI> So he undertook to write to all the places of trade, and to get &s;uch remittances made on that bank, that he &s;hould by that means have it &s;o entirely in his hands, that there &s;hould be no money current there, equal to the great occa&s;ion of victualling the fleet of <HI>Spain.</HI> He reckoned, the keeping &s;uch a trea&s;ure dead in his hands till the &s;ea&s;on of victualling was over, would be a lo&s;s of 40000 <HI>l.</HI> And at that rate he would &s;ave <HI>England.</HI> He managed the matter with &s;uch &s;ecrecy, and &s;ucce&s;s, that the fleet could not be &s;et out that year. At &s;o &s;mall a price, and with &s;o &s;killful a management, was the Nati|on &s;aved at that time. This it &s;eems was thought too great a my&s;tery of State to be communicated to <HI>Cambden,</HI> or to be pub|li&s;hed by him, when the in&s;tructions were put in his hands for writing the hi&s;tory of that glorious reign. But the famous <HI>Boyle,</HI> Earl of <HI>Cork,</HI> who had then a great &s;hare in the affairs of <HI>Ireland,</HI> came to know it; and told it to two of his children, from whom I had it. The &s;tory is &s;o coherent, and agrees &s;o well with the &s;tate of affairs at that time, that it &s;eems highly credible. And, if it is true, it is certainly one of the curiou&s;e&s;t pa&s;&s;ages in our whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> hi&s;tory. I return from this di|gre&s;&s;ion, which I hope will be no unacceptable entertainment to the reader: It is well known, how the de&s;ign of the Armada mi&s;carried: And &s;oon after that the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> was &s;tabbed: Not long after <HI>Henry</HI> III. was al&s;o &s;tabbed: And <HI>Henry</HI> IV. &s;uc|ceeded, who broke the League, with which the great de&s;igns of <HI>Spain</HI> fell to the ground. So happily did this third Cri&s;is pa&s;s over.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="329">
The fourth Cri&s;is was from the battel of <HI>Prague</HI> to the year 1630, in which, as was told in the fir&s;t book, not only the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> fell, but almo&s;t all the Empire came under the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The fouth Cri&s;is.</NOTE> <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> yoke. All attempts to &s;hake it off proved un&s;ucc&s;sful, and fatal to tho&s;e who undertook it, till the young and great King of <HI>Sweden, Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,</HI> engaged in it. The wars of <HI>Rochelle,</HI> together with the lo&s;s of that important place, &s;eem|ed to threaten the de&s;truction of the Prote&s;tants of <HI>France. En|gland</HI> fell under tho&s;e unhappy jealou&s;ies, which began a dis|jointing between the King and his people. And the States were much pre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> under <HI>Spinola. Breda</HI> was taken. But the wor&s;t of all was, a quarrel that was rai&s;ed between Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> and <HI>Barnevelt,</HI> that will require a fuller dicu&s;&s;i|on, than was offered in the former book. All agree, that <HI>Wil|liam</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was one of the greate&s;t men in &s;tory, who, after many attempts for the recovery of the liberty of the Pro|vinces, was in conclu&s;ion &s;ucce&s;sful, and formed that Republick. In the doing of it he was guilty of one great error, unle&s;s he was forced to it by the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs; which was the &s;ettling a negative in every one of the Towns of <HI>Holland,</HI> in the mat|ters of religion, of taxes, and of peace and war. It had been much &s;afer, if it had been determined, that the two thirds mu&s;t concur; by which the Government would have been much &s;tron|ger. Some thought, that he brought in &s;o many little Towns to balance the greater, of whom he could not be &s;ure; whereas he could more ea&s;ily manage the&s;e &s;maller ones. Others have &s;aid, that he was forced to it, to draw them to a more hearty concurrence in the war, &s;ince they were to have &s;uch a &s;hare in the Government for the future. But, as he &s;ettled it, the corruption of any one &s;mall Town may put all the affairs of <HI>Holland</HI> in great di&s;order. He was al&s;o blamed, becau&s;e he la|boured to rai&s;e the power of the Stadtholder &s;o high, that in many regards it was greater than the power of the Counts of <HI>Holland</HI> had been. But this was balanced by its being made elective, and by the &s;mall appointments he took to him&s;elf. It &s;eems, he de&s;igned to have &s;ettled that honour in his family: For after his death there were rever&s;al letters found among his papers from the Duke of <HI>Anjou,</HI> when the Provinces invited him to be their Prince, by which the Duke engaged him&s;elf to leave <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> in the Prince's hands. Before he died, he had in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t the affections of the Clergy; becau&s;e he was very earne&s;t for the toleration of Papi&s;ts, judging that nece&s;&s;ary for the engaging men of all per&s;ua&s;ions in the common concerns of liberty, and for encouraging the other Provinces to

come into the union. This was much oppo&s;ed by the preach|ers in <HI>Holland,</HI> who were for more violent methods. Tho&s;e, who but a few years before had complained of the cruelty of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> were no &s;ooner delivered from that, than they began to call for the &s;ame ways of pro&s;ecuting tho&s;e who were of the other &s;ide. This made that great Prince loo&s;e ground with the zealots of his own &s;ide before he died. With him all their affairs &s;unk &s;o fa&s;t, that they &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking protection el&s;ewhere. Their Mini&s;ters did of them&s;elves, with|out the concurrence of the States, &s;end to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> to de&s;ire her to take them under her protection, on &s;uch terms as &s;he &s;hould pre&s;cribe. And, tho' the States were highly offended at this, yet they dur&s;t not at that time complain of it, much le&s;s puni&s;h it; but were forced by the clamour of their people to follow an example that was &s;o irregularly &s;et them. This I had from <HI>Halewyn</HI> of <HI>Dort,</HI> of whom I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to write afterwards. When the Queen &s;ent over the Earl of <HI>Leice|&s;ter,</HI> with a new title, and an authority greater than was either in the Counts of <HI>Holland,</HI> or in the Stadtholder, by the name of Supreme Governour: He as &s;oon as he landed at <HI>Flu&s;hing</HI> went fir&s;t to Church, where he ordered prayers to be offered up for a ble&s;&s;ing on his coun&s;els, and de&s;ired that he might receive the Sacrament next day: And there he made &s;olemn prote&s;tations of his integrity and zeal. This plea&s;ed the people &s;o much, that <HI>Barnevelt,</HI> and the States at the <HI>Hague,</HI> thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the effects of &s;uch a threatning popula|larity: So they &s;ent for the Count, afterwards Prince, <HI>Maurice.</HI> who was then at <HI>Leyden,</HI> not yet eighteen, and cho&s;e him Stadt|holder of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand.</HI> There had been no provi|&s;ion made again&s;t that in their treaty with the Earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter.</HI> Yet he was highly offended at it. I will go no farther into the errors of his government, and the end that the Queen put to it; which &s;he did, as &s;oon as it appeared that he was incapa|ble of it, and was beginning to betray, and to &s;ell their be&s;t places.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> and <HI>Barnevelt</HI> continued long in a perfect <NOTE PLACE="marg">Differences between Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> of <HI>Orange</HI> and <HI>Barneveld.</HI></NOTE> conjunction of coun&s;els: Till upon the negotiation for a peace, or at lea&s;t for a truce, they differed &s;o much, that their friend|&s;hip ended in a mo&s;t violent hatred, and a jealou&s;y that could never be made up. Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> was for carrying on the war, which &s;et him at the head of a great army. And he had &s;o great an intere&s;t in the conque&s;ts they made, that for that very rea&s;on <HI>Barnevelt</HI> infu&s;ed it into the States, that they were now &s;afe, and needed not fear the <HI>Spaniards</HI> any more; &s;o there
<PB N="316" REF="331">
was no rea&s;on for continuing the war. Prince <HI>Mau$ice</HI> on the other hand &s;aid, their per&s;ecuted brethren in the Popi&s;h Provin$es wanted their help to &s;et them at liberty. The work &s;$$med ve|ry ea&s;y, and the pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s was great. In oppo$$$$on to this it was &s;aid; &s;ince the &s;even Provinces were now &s;afe, why &s;hould they extend their te$ritories? Tho&s;e who loved their re|ligion and liberty in the other Provinces might come and live among them: This would encrea&s;e both their numbers, and their wealth: Whereas the conque&s;t of <HI>Antwerp</HI> might prove fatal to them: Be&s;ides, that both <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> interpo&s;ed: They would not allow them to conquer more, nor become more for|midable. All the zealous preachers were for continuing the war: And tho&s;e that were for peace were branded as men of no religi|on, who had only carnal and political views. While this was in debate every where, the di&s;putes began between <HI>Arminius</HI> and <HI>Gomarus,</HI> two famous Profe&s;&s;ors at <HI>Leyden,</HI> concerning the decrees of God, and the efficacy of grace; in which tho&s;e two great men, <HI>Maurice</HI> and <HI>Barnevelt,</HI> went upon intere&s;t, to lead the two parties, from which they both differed in opinion. Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> in private always talked on the &s;ide of the <HI>Armi|nians:</HI> And <HI>Barnevelt</HI> believed prede&s;tination firmly. But, as he left reprobation out in his &s;cheme, &s;o he was again&s;t the unrea&s;ona|ble &s;everity with which the Mini&s;ters drove tho&s;e points. He found the <HI>Arminians</HI> were the better patriots: And he thought the other &s;ide out of their zeal were engaged for carrying on the war, &s;o as that they called all the others indifferent as to all religions, and charged them as favourers of <HI>Spain</HI> and Popery. I will go no farther into the differences that followed, concerning the authority of the States General over the &s;everal Provinces. It is certain, that every Province is a &s;eparated State, and has an entire &s;overeignty within it &s;elf; and that the States General are an a&s;&s;embly of the deputies of the &s;everal Provinces, but without any authority over them. Yet it was pretended, that extraordinary di&s;ea&s;es required extraordinary remedies: And Prince <HI>Ma$$ice,</HI> by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a party that the Mini&s;ters made for him among the people, engaged the States to a&s;&s;ume an au|thority over the Province of <HI>Holland,</HI> and to put the Government in new hands. A Court was erected by the &s;ame authority, to judge tho&s;e who had been formerly in the magi&s;tracy. <HI>Barnevelt</HI> was accu&s;ed, together with <HI>Grotius,</HI> and &s;ome others, as fo$span$en|ters of &s;edition, and for rai&s;ing di&s;tractions in the country. He was condemned, and beheaded. Others were condemned to per|petual impri&s;onment. And every one of the Judges had a great gold medal given them, in the rever&s;e of which the Synod of
<PB N="317" REF="332">
<HI>Dort</HI> was repre&s;ented, which was called by the &s;ame authority. I &s;aw one of tho&s;e medals in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the po&s;terity of one of tho&s;e Judges. King <HI>James</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> in all this: So powerfully do the intere&s;ts of Princes carry them to con|cur in things that are mo&s;t contrary to their own inclinations. The prevailing pa&s;&s;ion of that King was his hatred of the <HI>Pu|ritans:</HI> That made him hate the&s;e opinions into which they went with great heat: And, tho' he encouraged all that were of the <HI>Arminian</HI> party in his own dominions, yet he helped to cru&s;h them in <HI>Holland:</HI> He hated <HI>Barnevelt</HI> upon another &s;core; for his getting the cautionary towns out of his hands: And, ac|cording to the nature of impotent pa&s;&s;ions, this carried him to procure his ruine. After this victory that Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> had got over the party that oppo&s;ed him, he did not &s;tudy to car|ry it much farther. He found quickly how much he had lo&s;t the hearts of the people, who had before that time made him their idol, and now look'd at him with horrour. He &s;tudied to make up matters the be&s;t he could, that he might engage the States in the <HI>Bohemian</HI> war. But all that was &s;oon at an end. It was plain, that he had no de&s;ign upon their liberty: Tho' he could not bear the oppo&s;ition that he began to meet with from a free State.</P>
<P>His death put an end to all jealou&s;ies: And his brother Prince <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince <HI>Hen|ry Frederick</HI>'s wi&s;e go|vernment.</NOTE> <HI>Henry Frederick</HI> quickly &s;ettled the di&s;putes of <HI>Arminiani&s;$span$,</HI> by the toleration that was granted them. He was known to be a &s;ecret favourer of their tenets: He conducted the Armies of the States with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, and left them &s;o much at liberty as to all their &s;tate affairs, that all the jealou&s;ies which his brother's conduct had rai&s;ed, were quite extingui&s;hed by him. The States made him great pre&s;ents. He became very rich. And his &s;on had the &s;urvivance of the Stadtholder&s;hip. But his &s;on had more <NOTE PLACE="marg">His &s;on's hea$.</NOTE> of his uncle's fire in him, than of his father's temper. He op|po&s;ed the peace of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> all he could. The States came then to &s;ee, that they had continued too long in their alliance with <HI>France</HI> again&s;t <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;ince <HI>France</HI> had got the a&s;cendant by too vi&s;ible a &s;uperiority. So that their intere&s;t l$$ them now to &s;upport <HI>Spain</HI> again&s;t <HI>France.</HI> Prince <HI>William</HI> fell to be in ill terms with his mother. And &s;he, who had great credit with the States, &s;et up &s;uch an open oppo&s;ition to her &s;on, that the peace of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> was in a great mea&s;ure the effect of their private quarrel. Prince <HI>William,</HI> being married into the Royal family of <HI>England,</HI> did all he could to embroil the States with the new Common-wealth. But he met with &s;uch oppo&s;ition, that, he, finding the States were re&s;olved to di&s;mi&s;s a great part of th$ir
<PB N="318" REF="333">
Army, &s;uffered him&s;elf to be carried to violent coun&s;els. I need not enlarge on things that are &s;o well known, as his &s;ending &s;ome of the States pri&s;oners to <HI>Love&s;tein,</HI> and his de&s;ign to change the government of <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> which was di&s;covered by the po&s;t|boy, who gave the alarm a few hours before the Prince could get thither.</P>
<P>The&s;e things, and the effects that followed on them, are well known: As is al&s;o his death which followed a few weeks after, in the mo&s;t unhappy time po&s;&s;ible for the Prince&s;s Royal's big-belly. For as &s;he bore her &s;on a week after his death, in the eighth month of her time, &s;o he came into the world under great di&s;advantages. The States were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with great jealou&s;ies of the family; as if the a&s;piring to &s;ubdue the liberties of their country was inherent in it, and in&s;eparable from it. His private affairs were al&s;o in a very bad condition: Two great jointures went out of his e&s;tate, to his mother, and grand|mother, be&s;ides a va&s;t debt that his father had contracted to a&s;|&s;i&s;t the King. Who could have thought that an infant, brought into the world with &s;o much ill health, and under &s;o many ill circum&s;tances, was born for the pre&s;ervation of <HI>Europe,</HI> and of the Prote&s;tant religion? So unlike do the events of things prove to their fir&s;t appearances. And, &s;ince I am writing of his birth, I will &s;et down a &s;tory, much to the honour of a&s;trology, how little regard &s;oever I my &s;elf have to it. I had it from the late Queen's own mouth: And &s;he directed me to &s;ome who were of the Prince's Court in that time, who confirmed it to me. An unknown per&s;on put a paper in the old Prince&s;s's hands, which &s;he took from him, thinking it was a petition. When &s;he looked into it, &s;he found it was her &s;on's nativity, together with the fortunes of his life, and a full deduction of many accidents, which followed very punctually, as they were predicted. But that which was mo&s;t particular was, that he was to have a &s;on by a widow, and was to die of the &s;mall pox in the twenty fifth year of his age. So tho&s;e who were apt to give credit to predicti|ons of that &s;ort fancied, that the Prince&s;s Royal was to die; and that he was upon that to marry the widow of &s;ome other per&s;on. It was a common piece of raillery in the Court, upon the death of any Prince, to a&s;k what a per&s;on his widow was. But when he was taken ill of the &s;mall pox, then the decy|phering the matter was obvious, and it &s;truck his fancy &s;o much, that probably it had an ill effect upon him. Thus was the young Prince born; who was &s;ome years after barred by the Perpetual Edict, from all hopes of arriving at the Stadtholder|&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="334">
The chief error in <HI>De Wit</HI>'s admini&s;tration was, that he did not again rai&s;e the authority of the Council of State; &s;ince it <NOTE PLACE="marg">The errors of <HI>De Wit</HI>'s govern|ment.</NOTE> was very inconvenient to have both the legi&s;lature and the ex|ecution in the &s;ame hands. It &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to put the con|duct of affairs in a body of men, that &s;hould indeed be accoun|table to the States, but &s;hould be bred to bu&s;ine&s;s. By this means their coun&s;els might be both quick and &s;ecret; whereas, when all is to be determined by the States, they can have no &s;ecrets: And they mu&s;t adjourn often to con&s;ult their principals: So their proceedings mu&s;t be &s;low. During <HI>De Wit</HI>'s Mini&s;try, the Council of State was &s;o &s;unk, that it was con&s;idered only as one of the forms of the government. But the whole execution was brought to the States them&s;elves. Certainly a great a&s;&s;embly is a very improper &s;ubject of the executive part of power. It is indeed very proper, that &s;uch a body &s;hould be a check on tho&s;e, who have the executive power tru&s;ted to them. It is true, <HI>De Wit</HI> found it &s;o; which was occa&s;ioned by rea&s;on of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador's being once admitted to &s;it in that Council. They pretended, indeed, that it was only on the account of the cau|tionary towns; which moved the States to give <HI>England</HI> a right to &s;ome &s;hare in their coun&s;els. After the&s;e were re&s;tored, they did not think it decent to di&s;pute the right of the Amba&s;&s;ador's &s;itting any more there. But the ea&s;ier way was, the making that Council to &s;ignify nothing, and to bring all matters im|mediately to the States. It had been happy for <HI>De Wit</HI> him|&s;elf, and his country, if he had made u&s;e of the credit he had in the great turn upon Prince <HI>William</HI>'s death, to have brought things back to the State in which they had been anciently; &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hed errors of a con&s;titution and government can only be changed in a great revolution. He &s;et up on a popular bot|tom: And &s;o he was not only contented to &s;uffer matters to go on in the channel in which he found them; but in many things he gave way to the rai&s;ing the &s;eparated juri&s;diction of the towns, and to the le&s;&s;ening the authority of the Courts at the <HI>Hague.</HI> This rai&s;ed his credit, but weakened the union of the Provinces. The &s;ecret of all affairs, chiefly the foreign negotiations, lay in few hands. Others, who were not taken into the confidence, threw all mi&s;carriages on him; which was fatal to him. The repu|tation he had got in the war with <HI>England,</HI> and the happy con|clu&s;ion of it, broke a party that was then formed again&s;t him. After that he dictated to the States: And all &s;ubmitted to him. The concluding the Triple Alliance in &s;o &s;hort a time, and again&s;t the forms of their government, &s;hewed, how &s;ure he was of a general concurrence with every thing that he propo&s;ed.
<PB N="320" REF="335">
In the negotiations between the States, and <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> he fell into great errors. He &s;till fancied that the King of <HI>England</HI> mu&s;t &s;ee his own intere&s;t &s;o vi&s;ibly in the exaltation of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> that he reckoned that the wor&s;t that could happen was, to rai&s;e him to the tru&s;t of Stadtholder; &s;ince <HI>En|gland</HI> could not gain &s;o much by a conjunction with <HI>France,</HI> as by the King's having &s;uch an intere&s;t in their government, as he mu&s;t certainly come to have, when his nephew &s;hould be their Stadtholder. So he thought, he had a &s;ure re&s;erve to gain <HI>England</HI> at any time over to them. But he had no apprehen|&s;ion of the King's being a Papi&s;t, and his de&s;ign to make him|&s;elf ab&s;olute at home. And he was amazed to find, that, tho' the Court of <HI>England</HI> had talked much of that matter of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> when the States were in no di&s;po&s;ition to hearken to it, and &s;o u&s;ed it as a reproach or a ground of a quarrel, yet when it came more in view, they took no &s;ort of notice of it, and &s;eemed not only cold, but even di&s;plea&s;ed with it. The Prince, as his natural re&s;ervedne&s;s &s;aved him from com|mitting many errors, &s;o his gravity, and other vertues recom|mended him much to the Mini&s;ters, and to the body of the peo|ple. The family of <HI>De Wit,</HI> and the town of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> car|ried &s;till the remembrance of what was pa&s;s'd fre&s;h in their thoughts. They &s;et it al&s;o up for a maxim, that the making of a Stadtholder was the giving up their liberty, and that the con|&s;equence of it would be the putting the &s;overeignty of their country in him, or at lea&s;t in his family. The long conti|nuance of a Mini&s;try in one per&s;on, and that to &s;o high a de|gree, mu&s;t naturally rai&s;e envy, and beget di&s;content, e&s;pecial|ly in a popular government. This made many become <HI>De Wit</HI>'s enemies, and by con&s;equence the Prince's friends. And the Preachers employed all their zeal to rai&s;e the re&s;pect of the people for a family, under which they had been &s;o long ea&s;y and happy.</P>
<P>When the Prince was of full age, it was propo&s;ed in &s;o ma|ny <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> made Gene|ral.</NOTE> places that he &s;hould have the &s;upream command of their armies and fleets, that <HI>De Wit</HI> &s;aw the tide was too &s;trong to be re&s;i&s;ted. So, after he had oppo&s;ed it long, he propo&s;ed &s;ome limitations, that &s;hould be &s;ettled previous to his advance|ment. The harde&s;t of all was, that he &s;hould bind him&s;elf by oath never to pretend to be Stadtholder, nor &s;o much as to ac|cept of it, tho' it &s;hould be offered him. The&s;e conditions were not of an ea&s;y dige&s;tion. Yet, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary, that the Prince &s;hould be once at the head of their armies: That would create a great dependance on him: And if God ble&s;s'd him with
<PB N="321" REF="336">
&s;ucce&s;s, it would not be po&s;&s;ible to keep him &s;o low, as the&s;e limitations laid him: And the obligation never to accept of the Stadtholder&s;hip could only be meant of his not accepting the offer from any tumultuary bodies of the populace, or the army; but could not be a re&s;traint on him, if the States &s;hould make the offer, &s;ince his oath was made to them, and by con&s;equence it was in their power to relea&s;e the obligation that did ari&s;e from it to them&s;elves. The Court of <HI>England</HI> blamed him for &s;ub|mitting to &s;uch conditions. But he had no rea&s;on to rely much on the advices of tho&s;e, who had taken &s;o little care of him during all the credit they had with the States, while the Triple Alliance gave them a great intere&s;t in their affairs. As &s;oon as he was brought into the command of the armies, he told me, he &s;poke to <HI>De Wit,</HI> and de&s;ired to live in an entire confidence with him. His an&s;wer was cold: So he &s;aw that he could not depend upon him. When he told me this, he added, that he was cer|tainly one of the greate&s;t men of the age, and he believed he &s;erved his country faithfully. <HI>De Wit</HI> reckoned, that the <HI>French</HI> could not come to <HI>Holland</HI> but by the <HI>Mae&s;e.</HI> And he had taken great care of the garri&s;on of <HI>Ma&s;tricht;</HI> but very little of tho&s;e that lay on the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the <HI>I&s;el,</HI> where the States had many places, but none of them good. They were ill fortified, and ill &s;upplied. But mo&s;t of them were wor&s;e commanded, by men of no cou|rage, nor practice in military affairs, who con&s;idered their go|vernments as places, of which they were to make all the advan|tage that they could.</P>
<P>Now I come to give an account of the fifth Cri&s;is brought <NOTE PLACE="marg">The fifth Cri&s;is.</NOTE> on the whole Reformation, which has been of the longe&s;t con|tinuance, &s;ince we are yet in the agitations of it. The de&s;ign was fir&s;t laid again&s;t the States. But the method of invading them was &s;urprizing, and not look'd for. The Elector of <HI>Colen</HI> was all his life long a very weak man: Yet it was not thought that he could have been prevailed on to put the <HI>French</HI> in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his country, and to deliver him&s;elf with all his dominions over into their hands. When he did that, all upon the <HI>Rhine</HI> were &s;truck with &s;uch a con&s;ternation, that there was no &s;pirit nor courage left. It is true, they could not have made a great re&s;i&s;tance. Yet if they had but gained a little time, that had given the States &s;ome lei&s;ure to look round them, to &s;ee what was to be done.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>France</HI> came down to <HI>Utrecht,</HI> like a land flood. This &s;truck the <HI>Dutch</HI> with &s;o ju&s;t a terror, that nothing but <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> &s;ucce&s;s.</NOTE> great errors in his management could have kept them from de|livering them&s;elves entirely up to him. Never was more ap|plau&s;e given with le&s;s rea&s;on than the King of <HI>France</HI> had upon
<PB N="322" REF="337">
this campaign. His &s;ucce&s;s was owing rather to <HI>De Wit</HI>'s er|rors, than to his own conduct. There was &s;o little heart or judg|ment &s;hewn in the management of that run of &s;ucce&s;s, that, when that year is &s;et out, as it may well be, it will appear to be one of the lea&s;t glorious of his life; tho', when &s;een in a fal&s;e light, it appears one of the mo&s;t glorious in hi&s;tory. The conque&s;t of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> at that time might have been &s;o ea&s;ily com|pa&s;&s;ed, that, if his under&s;tanding and his courage had not been equally defective, he could not have mi&s;carried in it. When his army pa&s;s'd the <HI>Rhine,</HI> upon which &s;o much eloquence and poetry have been be&s;towed, as if all had been animated by his pre&s;ence and direction, he was viewing it at a very &s;afe di&s;tance. When he came to <HI>Utrecht,</HI> he had neither the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> nor Mr. <HI>Turenne</HI> to advi&s;e with: And he was wholly left to his Mini|&s;ters. The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> was &s;lightly wounded, as he pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Rhine:</HI> And <HI>Turenne</HI> was &s;ent again&s;t the Elector of <HI>Bran|denburgh,</HI> who was coming down with his army, partly to &s;ave his own country of <HI>Cleve,</HI> but chiefly to a&s;&s;i&s;t his allies the <HI>Dutch.</HI> So the King had none about him to advi&s;e with, but <HI>Pompone</HI> and <HI>Louvoy,</HI> when the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ent to him to know what he de|manded. <HI>Pompone</HI>'s advice was wi&s;e and moderate, and would in conclu&s;ion have brought about all that he intended. He pro|po&s;ed, that the King &s;hould re&s;tore all that belonged to the &s;e|ven Provinces, and require of them only the places that they had without them; chiefly <HI>Ma&s;tricht, Bois Le Duc, Breda,</HI> and <HI>Bergen-op-zoom:</HI> Thus the King would maintain an appearance of pre&s;erving the &s;even Provinces entire, which the Crown of <HI>France</HI> had always protected. To this certainly the <HI>Dutch</HI> would have yielded, without any difficulty. By this he had the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands</HI> entirely in his power, &s;eparated from <HI>Hol|land</HI> and the Empire; and might have taken them, when&s;oe|ver he plea&s;ed. This would have an appearance of moderation, and would &s;top the motion that all <HI>Germany</HI> was now in; which could have no effect, if the States did not pay and &s;ub&s;i&s;t the troops. <HI>Louvoy</HI> on the other hand propo&s;ed, that the King &s;hould make u&s;e of the con&s;ternation the <HI>Dutch</HI> were then in, and put them out of a condition of oppo&s;ing him for the future. <NOTE PLACE="marg">But follow|ed by an ill manage|ment.</NOTE> He therefore advi&s;ed, that the King &s;hould demand of them, be&s;ides all that <HI>Pompone</HI> moved, the paying a va&s;t &s;um for the charge of that campaign; the giving the chief Church in eve|ry town for the exerci&s;e of the Popi&s;h religion; and that they &s;hould put them&s;elves under the protection of <HI>France;</HI> and &s;hould &s;end an Emba&s;&s;ador every year with a medal acknowledging it; and &s;hould enter into no treaties, or alliances, but by the directions

of <HI>France.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> Emba&s;&s;adors were amazed, when they &s;aw that the demands ro&s;e to &s;o extravagant a pitch. One of them &s;wooned away; when he heard them read: He could nei|ther think of yielding to them, nor &s;ee how they could re&s;i&s;t them. There was an article put in for form, that they &s;hould give the King of <HI>England</HI> full &s;atisfaction. But all the other demands were made without any concert with <HI>England,</HI> tho' <HI>Lockhart</HI> was then following the Court.</P>
<P>I &s;ay nothing of the &s;ea fight in <HI>Solbay,</HI> in which <HI>De Ruyter</HI> had the glory of &s;urprizing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fleet, when they were thinking le&s;s of engaging the enemy, than of an extravagant preparation for the u&s;ual di&s;orders of the twenty ninth of <HI>May:</HI> Which he prevented, engaging them on the twenty eighth, in one of the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate &s;ea fights that has happened in our age; in which the <HI>French</HI> took more care of them&s;elves than became gallant men, unle&s;s they had orders to look on, and leave the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> to fight it out, while they pre&s;erved the force of <HI>France</HI> entire. <HI>De Ruyter</HI> di&s;abled the &s;hip in which the Duke was, whom &s;ome blamed for leaving his &s;hip too &s;oon. Then his per&s;onal courage began fir&s;t to be called in que&s;tion. The Admiral of the blue &s;quadron was burnt by a fire-&s;hip, af|ter a long engagement with a <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hip much inferior to him in &s;trength. In it the Earl of <HI>Sandwich</HI> peri&s;hed with a great many about him, who would not leave him, as he would not leave his &s;hip, by a piece of ob&s;tinate courage, to which he was provoked by an indecent reflection the Duke made on an advice he had of|fered, of drawing nearer the &s;hore, and avoiding an engagement, as if in that he took more care of him&s;elf than of the King's honour. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> came aboard the fleet; tho' it was ob|&s;erved, that he made great ha&s;te away, when he heard the <HI>Dutch</HI> fleet was in view. The Duke told me, that he &s;aid to him, &s;ince they might engage the enemy quickly, he intended to make &s;ure of another world: So he de&s;ired to know who was the Duke's Prie&s;t, that he might reconcile him&s;elf to the Church. The Duke told him, <HI>Talbot</HI> would help him to a Prie&s;t. And he brought one to him. They were for &s;ome time &s;hut up together. And the Prie&s;t &s;aid, he had reconciled him according to their form. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who had no religion at heart, did this only to recommend him&s;elf to the Duke's confidence.</P>
<P>It may be ea&s;ily imagined, that all things were at this time in <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> in great $word$ $word$</NOTE> great di&s;order at the <HI>Hagne.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of <HI>Naerden:</HI> And a party had entred into <HI>Muyden,</HI> who had the keys of the gates brought to them. But they, &s;eeing it was an incon&s;iderable place, not knowing the importance of it, by the
<PB N="324" REF="339">
command of the water that could drown all to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> flung the keys into the ditch, and went back to <HI>Naerden.</HI> But when the con&s;equence of the place was under&s;tood, another party was &s;ent to &s;ecure it. But before their return two battalions were &s;ent from the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who &s;ecured the place; and by that means pre&s;erved <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> where all were trembling, and thought of nothing but of treating and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The States were ve|ry near the extremities of de&s;pair. They had not only lo&s;t ma|ny places, but all their garri&s;ons in them. <HI>Guelder, Overy&s;&s;el,</HI> and <HI>Utrecht,</HI> were quite lo&s;t: And the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> was making a formidable impre&s;&s;ion on <HI>Groninghen,</HI> and at la&s;t be&s;ieg|ed it. All the&s;e misfortunes came &s;o thick one after another; that no &s;pirit was left. And, to compleat their ruine, a jealou&s;y was &s;pread thro' all <HI>Holland,</HI> that they were betrayed by tho&s;e who were in the government; and that <HI>De Wit</HI> intended, all &s;hould peri&s;h, rather than the family of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;hould be &s;et up. <HI>Mombas,</HI> one of their Generals, who married <HI>De Groot</HI>'s &s;i&s;ter, had ba&s;ely abandoned his po&s;t, which was to defend the <HI>Rhine</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> pa&s;&s;ed it: And when he was put in arre&s;t for that, he made his e&s;cape, and went to the <HI>French</HI> for &s;anctuary. Upon this the people complained loudly: And the States were &s;o puzzled, that their hearts quite failed them. When they were a&s;&s;embled, they looked on one another like men amazed; &s;ome|times all in tears. Once the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador came, and demanded audience. And when he was brought in, he told them, that out of the affection that he bore them, and the union of his Ma&s;ter's intere&s;t with theirs, he came to blame their conduct: They looked &s;ad: They never appeared in the <HI>Vorhaut</HI> in their coaches: And upon all occa&s;ions they looked like men de&s;pairing of their country: This quite di&s;heartened their people: Therefore he advi&s;ed them to put on another countenance, to publi&s;h that they had good news, that their allies were in march; and to feed their people with probable &s;tories, and &s;o to keep up their &s;pirits. They thought the advice was &s;ea&s;onable, and followed it.</P>
<P>They &s;ent two Emba&s;&s;adors, <HI>Dycvelt</HI> and <HI>Halewyn,</HI> to join <NOTE PLACE="marg">Emba&s;&s;a|dors &s;ent to <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> with <HI>Borel,</HI> who was &s;till in <HI>England</HI> to try if it was po&s;&s;ible to divide <HI>England</HI> from <HI>France.</HI> And the morning in which they were di&s;patch'd away, they had &s;ecret powers given them to treat concerning the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s being their Stadthol|der: For Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> had &s;o oft reproached <HI>Borel</HI> for their not doing it, that he in all his letters continued &s;till to pre&s;s that on them. When they came over, they were for form's &s;ake put under a guard. Yet <HI>Borel</HI> was &s;uffered to come to them; and was tran&s;ported with joy, when they told him what powers they
<PB N="325" REF="340">
had in that affair of the Prince. And immediately he went to Lord <HI>Arlington:</HI> But came &s;oon back, like one amazed, when he found that no regard was had to that, which he had hoped would have entirely gained the Court. But he was a plain man, and had no great depth. The others were &s;ent to <HI>Hampton</HI> Court; and were told, that the King would not treat &s;eparately, but would &s;end over Emba&s;&s;adors to treat at <HI>Utrecht.</HI> They met &s;ecretly with many in <HI>England,</HI> and informed them&s;elves by them of the &s;tate of the Nation. They gave money liberally, and gained &s;ome in the chief offices to give them intelligence. The Court under&s;tanding that they were not idle, and that the Nation was much inflamed, &s;ince all the offers that they made were rejected, commanded them to go back. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> were ordered to go to <HI>Utrecht.</HI> And, to give the Nation &s;ome &s;atisfaction, Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> was &s;ent over afterwards. But he was not put on the &s;ecret. The <HI>Dutch,</HI> hearing that their Emba&s;&s;adors were coming over with|out making peace with <HI>England,</HI> ran together in great numbers to <HI>Mae&s;land</HI> &s;luce, and re&s;olved to cut them in pieces at their landing; for they heard they were at the <HI>Brill.</HI> But, as they were cro&s;&s;ing the <HI>Maes,</HI> a little boat met them, and told them of their danger, and advi&s;ed them to land at another place, where coaches were &s;taying to carry them to the <HI>Hague.</HI> So they mi&s;&s;ed the &s;torm, that broke out fatally at the <HI>Hague</HI> the next day, where mens minds were in great agitation.</P>
<P><HI>De Wit</HI> was once at night going home from the States, when <NOTE PLACE="marg">The trag$cal end of <HI>De Wit.</HI></NOTE> four per&s;ons &s;et on him to murder him. He &s;hewed on that oc|ca&s;ion both an intrepid courage, and a great pre&s;ence of mind. He was wounded in &s;everal places. Yet he got out of their hands. One of them was taken, and condemned for it. All <HI>De Wit</HI>'s friends pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;ave his life. But he thought, that &s;uch an attempt on a man in his po&s;t was a crime not to be par|doned; tho', as to his own part in the matter, he very freely for|gave it. The young man confe&s;&s;ed his crime, and repented of it: And prote&s;ted he was led to it by no other con&s;ideration, but that of zeal for his country and religion, which he thought were betrayed. And he died as in a rapture of devotion, which made great impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;pectators. At the &s;ame time a Bar|ber accu&s;ed <HI>De Wit</HI>'s elder brother of a practice on him, in or|der to his murdering the Prince. There were &s;o many impro|babilities in his &s;tory, which was &s;upported by no circum&s;tances, that it &s;eemed no way credible. Yet <HI>Cornelius de Wit</HI> was put to the torture on it, but &s;tood firm to his innocence. The &s;entence was accommodated rather to the &s;tate of affairs, than to the
<PB N="326" REF="341">
&s;trict rules of ju&s;tice. In the mean time, while his brother had re&s;igned his charge of Pen&s;ionary, and was made one of the Judges of the High Court, <HI>Cornelius De Wit</HI> was bani&s;hed; which was intended rather as a &s;ending him out of the way, than as a &s;entence again&s;t him. I love not to de&s;cribe &s;cenes of horror, as was that black and infamous one committed on the two bro|thers. I can add little to what has been &s;o often printed. <HI>De Wit</HI>'s going in his own coach to carry his brother out of town was a great error: And looked like a triumph over a &s;entence, which was unbecoming the character of a Judge. Some furious agita|tors, who pretended zeal for the Prince, gathered the rabble together. And by that vile action that followed they did him more hurt, than they were ever able to repair. His enemies have taken advantages from thence to ca&s;t the infamy of this on him, and on his party, to make them all odious; tho' the Prince &s;poke of it always to me with the greate&s;t horror po&s;&s;ible. The Mini&s;ters in <HI>Holland</HI> did upon this occa&s;ion &s;hew a very particu|lar violence. In their &s;ermons, and in &s;ome printed treaties, they charged the Judges with corruption, who had carried the &s;en|tence no farther than to bani&s;hment: And compared the fate of the <HI>De Wits</HI> to <HI>Haman</HI>'s.</P>
<P>I need not relate the great change of the Magi&s;tracy in all the Provinces; the repealing the Perpetual Edict; and the advancing <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> made Stadt|holder.</NOTE> the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to be Stadtholder, after they had voided the obligation of the oath he had taken, about which he took &s;ome time to deliberate. Both Lawyers and Divines agreed, that tho&s;e to whom he had made that oath relea&s;ing the obli|gation of it, he was no longer bound by it. The States gave him, for that time, the full power of peace and war. All this was carried farther by the town of <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> for they &s;ent a deputa|tion to him, offering him the &s;overeignty of their town. When he was plea&s;ed to tell me this pa&s;&s;age, he &s;aid, he knew the rea&s;on for which they made it was, becau&s;e they thought all was lo&s;t: And they cho&s;e to have the infamy of their lo&s;s fall on him, rather than on them&s;elves. He added, that he was &s;ure the country could not bear a &s;overeign; and that they would con|tribute more to the war, when it was in order to the pre&s;erving their own liberty, than for any Prince what&s;oever. So he told them, that, without taking any time to con&s;ult on the an&s;wer to be made to &s;o great an offer, he did immediately refu&s;e it. He was fully &s;atisfied with the power already lodged with him, and would never endeavour to carry it any farther.</P>
<P>The Prince's advancement gave a new life to the whole coun|try. He, tho' then very young, and little acquainted with the
<PB N="327" REF="342">
affairs of State or War, did apply him&s;elf &s;o to both, that, not|with&s;tanding the de&s;perate &s;tate in which he found matters, he neither lo&s;t heart, nor committed errors. The Duke of <HI>Bucking|ham</HI> and the Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> tried to bring the King of <HI>France</HI> to offer them better terms; but in vain. That Prince was &s;o lift|ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;a|dors were wholly in the intere&s;t of <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> up, that he &s;eemed to con&s;ider the King very little. While he was &s;o high on the one hand, and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;o &s;teddy on the other, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;adors &s;oon &s;aw, that all the offices they could do were ineffectual. One day the Prince (who told me this him&s;elf) was arguing with them upon the King's conduct, as the mo&s;t unaccountable thing po&s;&s;ible, who was contributing &s;o much to the exaltation of <HI>France,</HI> which mu&s;t prove in conclu&s;ion fatal to him&s;elf; and was urging this in &s;e|veral particulars. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> broke out in an oath, which was his u&s;ual &s;tyle, and &s;aid, he was in the right; and &s;o offered to &s;ign a peace immediately with the Prince. Lord <HI>Ar|lington</HI> &s;eemed amazed at his ra&s;hne&s;s. Yet he per&s;i&s;ted in it, and &s;aid po&s;itively he would do it. The Prince upon that, not knowing what &s;ecret powers he might have, ordered the arti|cles to be engro&s;&s;ed. And he believed, if he could po&s;&s;ibly have got them ready while he was with him, that he would have &s;igned them. They were ready by next morning: But by that time he had changed his mind. That Duke at parting pre&s;&s;ed him much to put him&s;elf wholly in the King's hands; and a&s;|&s;ured him he would take care of his affairs, as of his own. The Prince cut him &s;hort: He &s;aid, his country had tru&s;ted him, and he would never deceive, nor betray them for any ba&s;e ends of his own. The Duke an&s;wered, he was not to think any more of his country, for it was lo&s;t: If it &s;hould weather out the &s;um|mer, by rea&s;on of the waters that had drowned a great part of it, the winter's fro&s;t would lay them open: And he repeated the words often, do not you &s;ee it is lo&s;t? The Prince's an&s;wer de|&s;erves to be remembred: He &s;aid, he &s;aw it was indeed in great danger: But there was a &s;ure way never to &s;ee it lo&s;t, and that was to die in the la&s;t ditch.</P>
<P>The per&s;on that the Prince relied on chiefly, as to the affairs <NOTE PLACE="marg">The charac|ter of <HI>Fagel,</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Holland,</HI> was <HI>Fagel:</HI> A man very learned in the law, who had a quick apprehen&s;ion, and a clear and ready judgment. He had a copious eloquence, more popular than correct: And was fit to carry matters with a torrent in a numerous a&s;&s;embly. <HI>De Wit</HI> had made great u&s;e of him; for he joined with him very zealou&s;ly in the carrying the Perpetual Edict, which he negoti|ated with the States of <HI>Frizeland,</HI> who oppo&s;ed it mo&s;t: And he was made Greffier, or Secretary to the States General, which
<PB N="328" REF="343">
is the mo&s;t beneficial place in <HI>Holland.</HI> He was a pious, and vertuous man: Only he was too eager, and violent. He was too apt to flatter him&s;elf. He had much heart, when matters went well; but had not the courage that became a great Mini&s;ter on unea&s;y and difficult occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Waldeck</HI> was their Chief General: A man of a great <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince <HI>Wal|deck.</HI></NOTE> compa&s;s, and a true judgment; equally able in the cabinet, and in the camp. But he was always un&s;ucce&s;sful, becau&s;e he was never furni&s;hed according to the &s;chemes that he had laid down. The opinion that Armies had of him, as an unfortunate Gene|ral, made him really &s;o: For &s;oldiers cannot have much heart, when they have not an entire confidence in him that has the chief command.</P>
<P><HI>Dickvelt</HI> on his return from <HI>England,</HI> &s;eeing the ruine of the <HI>De Wits,</HI> with whom he was formerly united, and the progre&s;s <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dickvelt.</NOTE> the <HI>French</HI> had made in <HI>Utrecht,</HI> where his e&s;tate and intere&s;t lay, de&s;paired too &s;oon; and went and lived under them. Yet he did great &s;ervice to his Province. Upon every violation of articles, he went and demanded ju&s;tice, and made prote|&s;tations with a boldne&s;s, to which the <HI>French</HI> were &s;o little ac|cu&s;tomed, that they were amazed at it. Upon the <HI>French</HI> leav|ing <HI>Utrecht,</HI> and on the re-e&s;tabli&s;hing that Province he was left out of the Government. Yet his great abilities, and the in&s;inu|ating &s;moothne&s;s of his temper, procured him &s;o many friends, that the Prince was prevailed on to receive him into his con|fidence: And he had a great &s;hare of it to the la&s;t, as he well de&s;erved it. He had a very perfect knowledge of all the affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> and great practice in many Emba&s;&s;ies. He &s;poke too long, and with too much vehemence. He was in his private deportment a vertuous and religious man, and a zealous Prote|&s;tant. In the admini&s;tration of his Province, which was chief|ly tru&s;ted to him, there were great complaints of partiality, and of a defective ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><HI>Halewyn,</HI> a man of great intere&s;t in the town of <HI>Dort,</HI> and one of the Judges in the Court of <HI>Holland,</HI> was the per&s;on of them <NOTE PLACE="marg">And <HI>Hale|wyn.</HI></NOTE> all whom I knew be&s;t, and valued mo&s;t: And was the next to <HI>Fagel</HI> in the Prince's confidence. He had a great compa&s;s of learning, be&s;ides his own profe&s;&s;ion, in which he was very emi|nent. He had &s;tudied divinity with great exactne&s;s; and was well read in all hi&s;tory, but mo&s;t particularly in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> authors. He was a man of great vivacity: He apprehend|ed things &s;oon, and judged very correctly. He &s;poke &s;hort, but with life. He had a courage and vigour in his coun&s;els, that became one who had formed him&s;elf upon the be&s;t models in
<PB N="329" REF="344">
the ancient authors. He was a man of &s;evere morals. And as he had great credit in the Court where he &s;ate, &s;o he took care that the partialities of friend&s;hip &s;hould not mix in the ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. He had in him all the be&s;t notions of a great patriot, and a true Chri&s;tian philo&s;opher. He was brought in very early to the &s;ecret of affairs, and went into the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Perpetual Edict very zealou&s;ly. Yet he quickly &s;aw the error of bringing matters of State immediately into numerous a&s;&s;emblies. He con&s;idered the States maintaining in them&s;elves the &s;overeign power, as the ba&s;is upon which the liberty of their country was built. But he thought, the admini&s;tration of the go|vernment mu&s;t be lodged in a Council. He thought it a great mi&s;|fortune, that the Prince was &s;o young at his fir&s;t exaltation; and &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with military matters, to which the extremity of their af|fairs required that he &s;hould be entirely applied, that he did not then correct that error, which could only be done upon &s;o extraordinary a conjuncture. He &s;aw the great error of <HI>De Wit</HI>'s mini&s;try, of keeping the &s;ecret of affairs &s;o much in his own hands. Such a precedent was very dangerous to publick liber|ty, when it was in the power of one man to give up his coun|try. Their people could not bear the lodging &s;o great a tru&s;t with one, who had no di&s;tinction of birth or rank. Yet he &s;aw it was nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;uch an authority, as <HI>De Wit</HI>'s merits and &s;ucce&s;s had procured him, lodged &s;ome where. The fac|tions and animo&s;ities, that were in almo&s;t all their towns, made it as nece&s;&s;ary for their good government at home, as it was for the command of their armies abroad, to have this power tru&s;ted to a per&s;on of that eminence of birth and rank, that he might be above the envy that is always among equals, when any one of them is rai&s;ed to a di&s;proportioned degree of greatne&s;s above the re&s;t. He ob&s;erved &s;ome errors that were in the Prin|ce's conduct. But after all, he &s;aid, it was vi&s;ible that he was al|ways in the true intere&s;t of his country: So that the keeping up a faction again&s;t him was like to prove fatal to all <HI>Europe,</HI> as well as to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t misfortune in the Prince's affairs was, that the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince &s;tudied to correct the errors he fell in at fir&s;t.</NOTE> wi&s;e&s;t, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable men in their towns, that had been acquainted with the conduct of affairs formerly, were now under a cloud, and were either turned out of the Magi&s;tracy, or thought it convenient to retire from bu&s;ine&s;s. And many hot, but poor men, who had &s;ignalized their zeal in the turn new|ly made, came to be called the Prince's friends, and to be put every where in the Magi&s;tracy. They quickly lo&s;t all credit, having little di&s;cretion, and no authority. They were very
<PB N="330" REF="345">
partial in the government, and oppre&s;&s;ive, chiefly of tho&s;e of the other &s;ide. The Prince &s;aw this &s;ooner than he could find a remedy for it. But by degrees the men of the other &s;ide came into his intere&s;t; and promi&s;ed to &s;erve him faithfully, in order to the driving out the <HI>French,</HI> and the &s;aving their country. The chief of tho&s;e were <HI>Halewyn</HI> of <HI>Dort, Pats</HI> of <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and <HI>Van Beuning</HI> of <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI></P>
<P>The la&s;t of the&s;e was &s;o well known, both in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>En|gland,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Van Beun|ing'<HI>s charac|ter.</HI></NOTE> and had &s;o great credit in his own town, that he de&s;erves to be more particularly &s;et out. He was a man of great noti|ons. He had a wonderful vivacity, but too much levity in his thoughts. His temper was incon&s;tant; firm, and po&s;itive for a while; but apt to change, from a giddine&s;s of mind, rather than from any fal&s;ehood in his nature. He broke twice with the Prince, after he came into a confidence with him. He em|ployed me to reconcile him to him for the third time: But the Prince &s;aid, he could not tru&s;t him any more. He had great knowledge in all &s;ciences, and had &s;uch a copiou&s;ne&s;s of in|vention, with &s;uch a plea&s;antne&s;s, as well as a variety, of con|ver&s;ation, that I have often compared him to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham:</HI> Only he was vertuous, and devout; much in the enthu&s;ia&s;tical way. In the end of his days he &s;et him&s;elf wholly to mind the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> trade. But that was an employ|ment not &s;o well &s;uited to his natural genius. And it ended fa|tally: For, the actions &s;inking on the &s;udden on the breaking out of a new war, that &s;unk him into a melancholly, which quite di&s;tracted him. The town of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> was for many years <NOTE PLACE="marg">Errors com|mitted by the town of <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI></NOTE> conducted by him as by a dictator. And that had expo&s;ed them to as many errors, as the irregularity of his notions &s;ugge&s;ted. The breaking the <HI>We&s;t India</HI> company, and the lo&s;s of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> in the year 1658, was owing to that. It was then demon&s;trat|ed, that the lo&s;s of that town laid the States open on that &s;ide; and that <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> being in their hands, would not only cover them, but be a fit place for making levies in <HI>We&s;tphalia.</HI> Yet <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> would not con&s;ent to that new charge; and fan|cied, there was no danger on that &s;ide. But they found after|wards, to their co&s;t, that their unrea&s;onable managery in that particular drew upon them an expence of many millions, by rea&s;on of the unquiet temper of that martial Bi&s;hop, who had almo&s;t ruined them this year on the &s;ide of <HI>Fri&s;eland.</HI> But his mi&s;carriage in the &s;iege of <HI>Groninghen,</HI> and the taking <HI>Coevor|den</HI> by &s;urprize in the end of the year, as it was among the fir&s;t things that rai&s;ed the &s;pirits of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> &s;o both the Bi&s;hop's
<PB N="331" REF="346">
&s;trength and reputation &s;unk &s;o entirely upon it, that he never gave them any great trouble after that.</P>
<P>Another error, into which the managery of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> drew the States, was occa&s;ioned by the offer that <HI>D'E&s;trades,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador, made them in the year 1663, of a divi&s;ion of the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands,</HI> by which <HI>Ostend</HI> and a line from thence to <HI>Ma&s;tricht,</HI> within which <HI>Bruges, Ghent,</HI> and <HI>Antwerp,</HI> were to be comprehended, was offered to them; the <HI>French</HI> de|&s;iring only St. <HI>Omer, Valenciennes, Cambray,</HI> and <HI>Luxemburgh:</HI> And the dominions that lay between tho&s;e lines were to be a free Common-wealth; as <HI>Halewyn</HI> a&s;&s;ured me, who &s;aid, he was in the &s;ecret at that time. This was much debated all <HI>Holland</HI> over. It was vi&s;ible, that this new Common-wealth, taken out of the hands of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> mu&s;t naturally have fallen into a dependance on the States; and have become more con&s;iderable, when put under a better conduct. Yet this would have put the States at that time to &s;ome con&s;iderable charge. And, to avoid that, the propo&s;ition was rejected, chiefly by the oppo&s;ition that <HI>Am|&s;terdam</HI> made to it; where the prevailing maxim was, to reduce their expence, to abate taxes, and to pay their publick debts. By &s;uch an unrea&s;onable par&s;imony matters were now brought to that &s;tate, that they were engaged into a war of &s;o va&s;t an expence, that the yearly produce of their whole e&s;tates, did not an&s;wer all the taxes that they were forced to lay on their people.</P>
<P>After the Prince &s;aw, that the <HI>French</HI> demands were at this <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince animates the States to continue the war.</NOTE> time &s;o high, and that it was not po&s;&s;ible to draw <HI>England</HI> into a &s;eparate treaty, he got the States to call an extraordinary a&s;&s;embly, the mo&s;t numerous that has been in this age. To them the Prince &s;poke near three hours, to the amazement of all that heard him, which was owned to me by one of the deputies of <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI> He had got great materials put in his hands, of which he made very good u&s;e. He fir&s;t went thro' the <HI>French</HI> propo&s;itions, and &s;hewed the con&s;equence and the effects that would follow on them; that the accepting them would be cer|tain ruine, and the very treating about them would di&s;tract and di&s;pirit their people: He therefore concluded, that the entertain|ing a thought of the&s;e was the giving up their country: If any could hearken to &s;uch a motion, the lovers of religion and li|berty mu&s;t go to the <HI>Indies,</HI> or to any other country where they might be free and &s;afe. After he had gone thro' this, near an hour, he in the next place &s;hewed the po&s;&s;ibility of making a &s;tand, notwith&s;tanding the de&s;perate &s;tate to which their affairs &s;eemed reduced: He &s;hewed the force of all their allies; that
<PB N="332" REF="347">
<HI>England</HI> could not hold out long without a Parliament; and they were well a&s;&s;ured, that a Parliament would draw the King to other mea&s;ures: He &s;hewed the impo&s;&s;ibility of the <HI>French</HI> hold|ing out long, and that the <HI>Germans</HI> coming down to the lower <HI>Rhine</HI> mu&s;t make them go out of their country, as fa&s;t as they came into it. In all this he &s;hewed, that he had a great in|&s;ight into the <HI>French</HI> affairs. He came la&s;t to &s;hew, how it was po&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e the taxes that mu&s;t be laid on the country to an|&s;wer &s;uch a va&s;t and unavoidable expence; and &s;et before them a great variety of projects for rai&s;ing money. He concluded, that, if they laid down this for a foundation, that religion and liberty could not be purcha&s;ed at too dear a rate, and that there|fore every man among them, and every Mini&s;ter in the country, ought to infu&s;e into all the people, that they mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the pre&s;ent extremity, and to very extraordinary taxes; by this means, as their people would again take heart, &s;o their enemies would loo&s;e theirs, who built their chief hopes on that univer&s;al dejec|tion among them, that was but too vi&s;ible to all the world. Every one that was pre&s;ent &s;eemed amazed to hear &s;o young a man &s;peak to &s;o many things, with &s;o much knowledge, and &s;o true a judgment. It rai&s;ed his character wonderfully, and con|tributed not a little to put new life in a country, almo&s;t dead with fear, and di&s;pirited with &s;o many lo&s;&s;es. They all re|&s;olved to maintain their liberty to the la&s;t; and, if things &s;hould run to extremities, to carry what wealth they could with them to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies.</HI> The &s;tate of the &s;hipping capa|ble of &s;o long a voyage was examined: And it was reckoned, that they could tran&s;port above two hundred thou&s;and people thither.</P>
<P>Yet all their courage would probably have &s;erved them in lit|tle <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> King goes back to <HI>Pa|ris</HI></NOTE> &s;tead, if the King of <HI>France</HI> could have been prevailed on to &s;tay longer at <HI>Utrecht.</HI> But he made ha&s;te to go back to <HI>Pa|ris.</HI> Some &s;aid, it was the effect of his amours, and that it was ha&s;tened by &s;ome quarrels among his Mi&s;tri&s;&s;es. Others thought, he was ha&s;tening to receive the flatteries that were preparing for him there. And indeed in the outward appearances of things there was great occa&s;ion for them; &s;ince he had a run of &s;uc|ce&s;s beyond all expectation, tho' he him&s;elf had no &s;hare in it, unle&s;s it was to &s;poit it. He left a garri&s;on in every place he took, again&s;t <HI>Turenne</HI>'s advice, who was for di&s;mantling them all, and keeping his army &s;till about him. But his Mini&s;ters &s;aw &s;o far into his temper, that they re&s;olved to play a &s;ure game, and to put nothing to hazard. Upon the Elector of <HI>Branden|burgh</HI>'s coming down, <HI>Mon&s;ieur Turenne</HI> was &s;ent again&s;t him:
<PB N="333" REF="348">
By which means the army about the King was &s;o dimini&s;hed, that he could undertake no great de&s;ign, be&s;ides the &s;iege of <HI>Ni|meguen,</HI> that held out &s;ome weeks, with &s;o &s;mall a force. And tho' the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had not above eight thou&s;and men about him, employed in keeping a pa&s;s near <HI>Woerden,</HI> yet no attempt was made to force him from it. Another probable rea&s;on of his returning back &s;o &s;oon was, a &s;ugge&s;tion of the de&s;perate tem|per of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and that they were capable of undertaking any de&s;ign, how black &s;oever, rather than peri&s;h. Some told him of vaults under the &s;treets of <HI>Utrecht,</HI> where gun-powder might be laid to blow him up, as he went over them: And all the&s;e were ob&s;erved to be avoided by him. He would never lodge within the town, and came but &s;eldom to it. He upon one or other of the&s;e motives went back. Upon which the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> &s;aid, he &s;aw he had not the &s;oul of a conqueror in him; and that his Mini&s;ters were the be&s;t <HI>Commis,</HI> but the poore&s;t Mini&s;ters in the world, who had not &s;ouls made for great things, or capable of them.</P>
<P>If the King had a mind to be flattered by his people, he found at his return enough even to &s;urfeit him. Speeches, ver&s;es, in&s;criptions, triumphal arches, and medals were prepared with a profu&s;ion, and exce&s;s of flattery, beyond what had been offered to the wor&s;t of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, baiting the ce|remony of adoration. But bla&s;phemous impieties were not wanting to rai&s;e, and feed his vanity. A &s;olemn debate was held all about <HI>Paris,</HI> what title &s;hould be given him. <HI>Le Grand</HI> was thought too common. Some were for <HI>Invincible.</HI> Others were for <HI>Le Conquerant.</HI> Some, in imitation of <HI>Charlemagne,</HI> for <HI>Lewis Le magne.</HI> Others were for <HI>Maximus.</HI> But <HI>Tres Grand</HI> &s;ounded not &s;o well: No more did <HI>Maxime.</HI> So they &s;ettled on <HI>Le Grand.</HI> And all the bodies of <HI>Paris</HI> &s;eemed to vie in flattery. It appeared, that the King took plea&s;ure in it: So there has followed upon it the greate&s;t run of the mo&s;t ful&s;om flattery that is in hi&s;tory. Had the King of <HI>France</HI> left &s;uch a man as <HI>Turenne</HI> at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> it might have had ill effects on the re&s;olutions taken by the <HI>Dutch.</HI> But he left <HI>Luxem|burgh</HI> there, who had no regard to articles; but made all peo|ple &s;ee what was to be expected, when they &s;hould come under &s;uch a yoke, that was then &s;o intolerable a burden, even while it ought to have been recommended to tho&s;e who were yet free by a gentle admini&s;tration. This contributed not a little to fix the <HI>Dutch</HI> in tho&s;e ob&s;tinate re&s;olutions they had tak|en up.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="349">
There was one very extraordinary thing that happened near the <HI>Hague</HI> this &s;ummer: I had it from many eye wit|ne&s;&s;es: And no doubt was made of the truth of it by any at <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;aved by &s;ome extra|ordinary&punc; Providence.</NOTE> the <HI>Hague.</HI> Soon after the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fleet had refitted them|&s;elves, (for they had generally been much damaged by the engagement in <HI>Solbay,)</HI> they appeared in &s;ight of <HI>Schevel|ing,</HI> making up to the &s;hore. The tide turned: But they reck|oned that with the next flood they would certainly land the forces that were aboard, where they were like to meet with no re&s;i&s;tance. So they &s;ent to the Prince for &s;ome regiments to hinder the de&s;cent. He could not &s;pare many men, hav|ing the <HI>French</HI> very near him. So between the two the country was given for lo&s;t, unle&s;s <HI>De Ruyter</HI> &s;hould quickly come up. The flood returned, which they thought was to end in their ruine. But to all their amazement, after it had flowed two or three hours, an ebb of many hours &s;ucceeded, which carried the fleet again to the &s;ea. And, before that was &s;pent, <HI>De Ruyter</HI> came in view. This they reckoned a miracle wrought for their pre&s;ervation. Soon after that they e&s;caped another de&s;ign, that otherwi&s;e would very probably have been fatal to them.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>O&s;&s;ory,</HI> elde&s;t &s;on to the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> a man <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>O&s;&s;ory</HI> in|tended to &s;urpri&s;e <HI>Hel|voet&s;luys.</HI></NOTE> of great honour, genero&s;ity, and courage, had been oft in <HI>Hol|land:</HI> And, coming by <HI>Helvoet&s;luys,</HI> he ob&s;erved, it was a place of great con&s;equence, but very ill looked to. The <HI>Dutch</HI> tru&s;t|ing to the danger of entring into it, more than to any &s;trength that defended it, he thought it might be ea&s;y to &s;eize, and for|tify that place. The King approved this. So &s;ome &s;hips were &s;heathed, and victualled, as for a voyage to a great di&s;tance. He was to have five men of war, and tran&s;port &s;hips for twelve or fifteen hundred men. And a &s;econd &s;quadron, with a farther &s;upply, if he &s;ucceeded in the attempt, was to follow. He had got two or three of their pilots brought out on a pretended er|rand: And the&s;e he kept very &s;afe to carry him in. This was communicated to none, but to the Duke, and to Lord <HI>Arlington:</HI> And all was ready for the execution. Lord <HI>O&s;&s;ory</HI> went to this fleet, and &s;aw every thing ready as was ordered, and came up to re|ceive the King's &s;ailing orders. But the King, who had order|ed him to come next morning for his di&s;patch, di&s;covered the de&s;ign to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who hated both the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and Lord <HI>O&s;&s;ory,</HI> and would have &s;een the King and all his affairs peri&s;h, rather than that a per&s;on whom he hated &s;hould have the honour of &s;uch a piece of merit. He up|on that did turn all his wit to make the thing appear ridiculous,
<PB N="335" REF="350">
and impracticable. He repre&s;ented it as un&s;afe on many accounts; and as a de&s;perate &s;troke, that put things, if it &s;hould &s;ucceed, out of a po&s;&s;ibility of treaty or reconciliation. The King could not with&s;tand this. Lord <HI>O&s;&s;ory</HI> found next morning that the King had changed his mind. And it broke out, by the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s loo&s;e way of talking, that it was done by his means. So the de&s;ign was laid a&s;ide. But when the peace was made, Lord <HI>O&s;&s;ory</HI> told it to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Emba&s;&s;adors: And &s;aid, &s;ince he did not de&s;troy them by touching them in that weak and &s;ore part, he had no mind they &s;hould lye any longer open to &s;uch another attack. When the Emba&s;&s;adors wrote this over to their ma&s;ters, all were &s;en&s;ible, how ea&s;y it had been to have &s;eized, and &s;ecured that place; and what a terrible di&s;order it would have put them in: And upon this they gave order to put the place in a better po&s;ture of defence for the future. So powerfully did &s;pite work on tho&s;e about the King: And &s;o ea|&s;y was he to the man of wit and humour. The Duke &s;taid long at &s;ea, in hopes to have got the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> fleet. But they came &s;ailing &s;o near the <HI>German</HI> coa&s;t, that they pa&s;&s;ed him before he was aware of it. So he came back after a long and inglori|ous campaign. He lo&s;t the honour of the action that was at <HI>Sol|bay;</HI> and mi&s;&s;ed the wealth of that fleet, which he had long waited for.</P>
<P>I will compleat the tran&s;actions of this memorable year with <NOTE PLACE="marg">An army from <HI>Utrecht</HI> came on the ice to <HI>Hol|land.</HI></NOTE> an account of the impre&s;&s;ion that <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> made on the <HI>Dutch</HI> near the end of it; which would have had a very tragi|cal conclu&s;ion, if a happy turn of weather had not &s;aved them. <HI>Stoupe</HI> was then with him, and was on the &s;ecret. By many feints, that amu&s;ed the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;o &s;killfully that there was no &s;u&s;picion of the true de&s;ign, all was prepared for an inva&s;ion, when a fro&s;t &s;hould come. It came at la&s;t: And it froze and thawed by turns for &s;ome time, which they reckon makes the ice firme&s;t. At la&s;t a fro&s;t continued &s;o &s;trong for &s;ome days, that upon piercing and examining the ice, it was thought it could not be di&s;&s;olved by any ordinary thaw in le&s;s than two days. So about midnight <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> marched out of <HI>Utrecht</HI> towards <HI>Leyden</HI> with about &s;ixteen thou&s;and men. Tho&s;e of <HI>Utrecht</HI> told me, that, in the minute in which they began to march, a thaw wind blew very fre&s;h. Yet they marched on till day light, and came to <HI>Summerdam</HI> and <HI>Bodegrave,</HI> which they gained not without difficulty. There they &s;topt, and com|mitted many outrages of crying lu&s;t and barbarous cruelty; and vented their impiety in very bla&s;phemous expre&s;&s;ions, upon the continuance of the thaw, which now had quite melted the ice,
<PB N="336" REF="351">
&s;o that it was not po&s;&s;ible to go back, the way that they came, where all had been ice, but was now di&s;&s;olved to about three foot depth of water. There were cau&s;e-ways: And they were forced to march on the&s;e. But there was a fort, thro'which they mu&s;t pa&s;s. And one <HI>Painevine</HI> with two regiments was ordered to keep it, with &s;ome cannon in it. If he had continued there, they mu&s;t all have been taken pri&s;oners, which would have put an end to the war. But, when he &s;aw them march to him in the morning, he gave all for lo&s;t; and went to <HI>Tergow,</HI> where he gave the alarm, as if all was gone. And he offered to them, to come to help them by that garri&s;on to a better capitulation. So he left his po&s;t, and went thither. The <HI>French</HI> army, not being &s;topt by that fort, got &s;afe home. But their behaviour in tho&s;e two villages was &s;uch, that, as great pains was taken to &s;pread it over the whole country, &s;o it contributed not a little to the e&s;tabli&s;hing the <HI>Dutch</HI> in their re&s;olutions, of not only venturing but of loo&s;ing all, rather than come under &s;o cruel a yoke.</P>
<P><HI>Painevine</HI>'s withdrawing had lo&s;t them an advantage never to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Painevine</HI>'s &s;entence.</NOTE> be regained. So the Prince ordered a Council of war to try him. He pleaded, that the place was not tenable; that the enemy had pa&s;s'd it; &s;o he thought the u&s;e it was intended for was lo&s;t: And if the enemy had come to attack him, he mu&s;t have &s;urrendered upon di&s;cretion: And he pleaded farther, that he went from it upon the de&s;ire of one of their towns to &s;ave it. Upon this defence, he was acquitted as to his life, but condemned to infamy, as a coward, and to have his &s;word broke over his head, and to be for ever bani&s;hed the States dominions. But an appeal lay, according to their di&s;cipline, to a Council of war compo&s;ed of General Officers: And they confirmed the &s;entence. The towns of <HI>Holland</HI> were highly offended at the&s;e proceed|ings. They &s;aid, they &s;aw the officers were re&s;olved to be gen|tle to one another, and to &s;ave their fellow officers, how guilty &s;oever they might be. The Prince yielded to their in&s;tances, and brought him to a third trial before him&s;elf, and a Court of the &s;upreme officers, in which they had the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ix Judges. <HI>Painevine</HI> &s;tood on it, that he had undergone two tri|als, which was all that the martial law &s;ubjected him to; and in tho&s;e he was acquitted. Yet this was over-ruled. It was urged again&s;t him, that he him&s;elf was pre&s;ent in the Council of war that ordered the making that fort; and he knew, that it was not intended to be a place tenable again&s;t an army, but was only meant to make a little &s;tand for &s;ome time, and was intend|ed for a de&s;perate &s;tate of affairs; and that therefore he ought
<PB N="337" REF="352">
not to have left his po&s;t, becau&s;e of the danger he was in: He &s;aw the thaw began; and &s;o ought to have &s;taid, at lea&s;t till he had &s;een how far that would go: And being put there by the Prince, he was to receive orders from none but him. Upon the&s;e grounds he was condemned, and executed, to the great &s;atisfaction of the States, but to the general di&s;gu&s;t of all the officers, who thought they were &s;afe in the hands of an or|dinary council of war, and did not like this new method of proceeding.</P>
<P>They were al&s;o not a little troubled at the &s;trict di&s;cipline that the Prince &s;ettled, and at the &s;evere execution of it. But by this means he wrought up his army to a pitch of obedience and courage, of &s;obriety and good order, that things put on another face: And all men began to hope that their armies would act with another &s;pirit, now that the di&s;cipline was &s;o carefully look'd to. It &s;eems, the <HI>French</HI> made no great account of them: For they relea&s;ed twenty five thou&s;and pri&s;oners, tak|en in &s;everal places, for fifty thou&s;and crowns.</P>
<P>Thus I have gone far into the &s;tate of affairs of <HI>Holland</HI> in this memorable year. I had mo&s;t of the&s;e particulars from <HI>Dyckvelt</HI> and <HI>Halewyn.</HI> And I thought this great turn de&s;erved to be &s;et out with all the copiou&s;ne&s;s, with which my informations could furni&s;h me. This year the King declared a new Mi&s;tri&s;s, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>French</HI> Mi&s;tri&s;s made Duch|e&s;s of <HI>Port&s;|mouth.</HI></NOTE> made her Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> She had been maid of honour to <HI>Madame,</HI> the King's &s;i&s;ter and had come over with her to <HI>Do|ver;</HI> where the King had expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch a regard to her, that the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who hated the Duche&s;s of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> in|tended to put her on the King. He told him, that it was a decent piece of tenderne&s;s for his &s;i&s;ter to take care of &s;ome of her &s;ervants. So &s;he was the per&s;on the King ea&s;ily con&s;ented to invite over. That Duke a&s;&s;ured the King of <HI>France,</HI> that he could never reckon him&s;elf &s;ure of the King, but by giving him a Mi&s;tri&s;s that &s;hould be true to his intere&s;ts. It was &s;oon agreed to. So the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> &s;ent her with a part of his equipage to <HI>Dieppe;</HI> and &s;aid, he would pre&s;ently follow. But he, who was the mo&s;t incon&s;tant and forgetful of all men, ne|ver thought of her more; but went to <HI>England</HI> by the way of <HI>Calais.</HI> So <HI>Montague,</HI> then Emba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Paris,</HI> hearing of this, &s;ent over for a Yacht for her, and &s;ent &s;ome of his &s;er|vants to wait on her, and to defray her charge, till &s;he was brought to <HI>Whitehall:</HI> And then Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> took care of her. So the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> lo&s;t the merit he might have pretended to; and brought over a Mi&s;tre&s;s, whom his own &s;trange conduct threw into the hands of his enemies. The King was
<PB N="338" REF="353">
pre&s;ently taken with her. She &s;tudied to plea&s;e and ob&s;erve him in every thing: So that he pa&s;s'd away the re&s;t of his life in a great fondne&s;s for her. He kept her at a va&s;t charge. And &s;he by many fits of &s;ickne&s;s, &s;ome believed real, and others thought only pretended, gained of him every thing &s;he de&s;ired. She &s;tuck firm to the <HI>French</HI> intere&s;t, and was its chief &s;upport. The King divided him&s;elf between her and Mi&s;tri&s;s <HI>Gwyn;</HI> and had no other avowed amour. But he was &s;o entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and &s;o engaged by her in the <HI>French</HI> intere&s;t, that this threw him into great difficulties, and expo&s;ed him to much contempt and di&s;tru&s;t.</P>
<P>I do now return to the affairs of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to give an account <NOTE PLACE="marg">The affairs of <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> of a &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, and the other tran&s;actions there in this critical year. About the end of <HI>May,</HI> Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> came down with his Lady in great pomp. He was much lifted up with the <HI>French</HI> &s;ucce&s;s; and took &s;uch plea&s;ure in talking of <HI>De Wit</HI>'s fate, that it could not be heard without horror. He treated all people with &s;uch &s;corn, that few were able to bear it. He adjourned the Parliament for a fortnight, that he might car|ry his Lady round the country; and was every where waited on, and entertained, with as much re&s;pect, and at as great a charge, as if the King had been there in per&s;on. This en|raged the Nobility. And they made great applications to Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> to lead a party again&s;t him, and to oppo&s;e the tax, that he demanded, of a whole year's a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment. I &s;oon grew <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s great in&s;o|lence.</NOTE> &s;o weary of the Court, tho' there was &s;carce a per&s;on &s;o well u&s;ed by him as I my &s;elf was, that I went out of town. But Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> &s;ent for me; and told me, how vehemently he was &s;olicited by the majority of the Nobility to oppo&s;e the demand of the tax. He had promi&s;ed me not to oppo&s;e taxes in general: And I had a&s;&s;ured Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> of it. But he &s;aid, this demand was &s;o extravagant, that he did not imagine it would go &s;o far: So he did not think him&s;elf bound, by a promi&s;e made in general words, to agree to &s;uch a high one. Upon this I &s;poke to Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> to &s;hew him the incli|nations many had to an oppo&s;ition to that demand, and the danger of it. He rejected it in a brutal manner, &s;aying, they dur&s;t as &s;oon be damned as oppo&s;e him. Yet I made him &s;o &s;en&s;ible of it, that he appointed the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Athol</HI> to go and talk in his name to Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who moved that I might be pre&s;ent: And that was ea&s;ily admitted. Lord <HI>Athol</HI> pre&s;&s;ed Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> to come into an entire confidence with Duke <HI>Lauderdale;</HI> and promi&s;ed, that he &s;hould have the chief direc|tion of all affairs in <HI>Scotland</HI> under the other. Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI>
<PB N="339" REF="354">
a&s;ked, how &s;tood the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> affected to the war. Lord <HI>Athol</HI> a&s;&s;ured him, there was a &s;ettled de&s;ign of having no more Parliaments in <HI>England.</HI> The King would be ma&s;ter, and would be no longer curbed by a Hou&s;e of Commons. He al&s;o laid out the great advantages that <HI>Scotland,</HI> more particular|ly the great Nobility, might find by &s;triking in heartily with the King's de&s;igns, and in making him ab&s;olute in <HI>England.</HI> Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> an&s;wered very hone&s;tly, that he would never engage in &s;uch de&s;igns: He would be always a good and faithful &s;ub|ject: But he would be likewi&s;e a good country man. He was very unwilling to concur in the land tax. He &s;aid, <HI>Scotland</HI> had no rea&s;on to engage in the war, &s;ince as they might &s;uffer much by it, &s;o they could gain nothing, neither by the pre&s;ent war, nor by any peace that &s;hould be made. Yet he was prevailed on, in conclu&s;ion, to agree to it. And upon that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament went on &s;moothly without any op|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Duche&s;s of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> not contented with the great appointments they had, &s;et her &s;elf by all po&s;&s;ible methods to rai&s;e money. They lived at a va&s;t expence: And every thing was &s;et to &s;ale. She carried all things with a haughtine&s;s, that could not have been ea&s;ily born from a Queen. She talked of all people with an ungoverned freedom, and grew to be uni|ver&s;ally hated. I was out of mea&s;ure weary of my attendance at their Court, but was pre&s;&s;ed to continue it. Many found I did good offices. I got &s;ome to be con&s;idered, and advanced, that had no other way of acce&s;s. But that which made it more nece&s;&s;ary was, that I &s;aw <HI>Sharp</HI> and his creatures were making their Court with the mo&s;t abject flattery, and all the &s;ubmi&s;&s;i|ons po&s;&s;ible. <HI>Leightoun</HI> went &s;eldom to them, tho' he was al|ways treated by them with great di&s;tinction. So it was nece&s;&s;ary for me to be about them, and keep them right: Otherwi&s;e all our de&s;igns were lo&s;t without recovery. This led me to much unea&s;y compliance; tho' I a&s;&s;erted my own liberty, and found &s;o often fault with their proceedings, that once or twice I u&s;ed &s;uch freedom, and it was &s;o ill taken, that I thought it was fit for me to retire. Yet I was &s;ent for, and continued in &s;uch high favour, that I was again tried if I would accept of a Bi&s;hoprick, and was promi&s;ed the fir&s;t of the two Archbi&s;hopricks that &s;hould fall. But I was &s;till fixed in my former re&s;olutions, not to en|gage early, being then but nine and twenty: Nor could I come into a dependance on them.</P>
<P>Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> at his coming down had expected, that the <NOTE PLACE="marg">He expected addre&s;&s;es for a Tolerati|on.</NOTE> Pre&s;byterians &s;hould have addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to him for a &s;hare
<PB N="340" REF="355">
in that liberty, which their brethren had now in <HI>England;</HI> and which he had a&s;&s;erted in a very particular manner at the Coun|cil table in <HI>White-hall.</HI> One <HI>Whatley,</HI> a Ju&s;tice of peace in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> if I remember the County right, had di&s;turbed one of the Meeting-hou&s;es, that had got a licence pur&s;uant to the declaration for a Toleration: And he had &s;et fines on tho&s;e that met in it, conformably to the Act again&s;t Conventicles. Upon which he was brought up to Council, to be reprimanded for his high contempt of his Maje&s;ty's declaration. Some Privy Coun&s;ellours &s;hewed their zeal in &s;evere reflections on his pro|ceedings. Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> carried the matter very far: He &s;aid, the King's edicts were to be con&s;idered, and obeyed as laws, and more than any other laws. This was writ down by &s;ome that heard it, who were re&s;olved to make u&s;e of it again&s;t him in due time. He looked on near two months after he came down to <HI>Scotland,</HI> waiting &s;till for an application for liberty of con&s;cience. But the de&s;igns of the Court were now clearly &s;een into. The Pre&s;byterians under&s;tood, they were only to be made u&s;e of in order to the introducing of Popery. So they re&s;olved to be &s;ilent and pa&s;&s;ive. Upon this he broke out into fury and rage again&s;t them. Conventicles abounded in all places of the country. And &s;ome furious zealots broke into the hou&s;es of &s;ome of the Mini&s;ters, wounding them, and robbing their goods, forc|ing &s;ome of them to &s;wear that they would never officiate any more in their Churches. Some of the&s;e were taken, and executed. I vi|&s;ited them in pri&s;on; and &s;aw in them the blind madne&s;s of ill grounded zeal, of which they were never fully convinced. One of them &s;eemed to be otherwi&s;e no ill man. Another of them was a bold villain. He ju&s;tified all that they had done, from the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> robbing the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> and de&s;troying the <HI>Canaanites.</HI></P>
<P>That which gave Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> a ju&s;ter ground of of|fence <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;igns from <HI>Hol|land</HI> to rai&s;e a rebellion in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> was, that one <HI>Car&s;tairs,</HI> much employed &s;ince that time in greater matters, was taken in a &s;hip that came from <HI>Rot|terdam.</HI> He him&s;elf e&s;caped out of their hands: But his let|ters were taken. They had a great deal writ in white ink; which &s;hewed, that the de&s;ign of &s;ending him over was, to know in what di&s;po&s;ition the people were, promi&s;ing arms and other nece&s;&s;aries, if they were in a condition to give the Govern|ment any di&s;turbance. But the whole was &s;o darkly writ, much being referred to the bearer, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to under|&s;tand what lay hid under &s;o many my&s;terious expre&s;&s;ions. Up|on this a &s;evere pro&s;ecution of Conventicles was &s;et on foot: And a great deal of money was rai&s;ed by arbitrary fines. Lord <HI>Athol</HI> made of this in one week 1900 <HI>l. &s;ter.</HI> I did all I could
<PB N="341" REF="356">
to moderate this fury: But all was in vain. Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> broke out into the mo&s;t frantick fits of rage po&s;&s;ible. When I was once &s;aying to him, was that a time to drive them into a rebellion? Yes, &s;aid he, would to God they would rebel, that &s;o he might bring over an army of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Papi&s;ts to cut all their throats. Such a fury as this &s;eemed to furni&s;h work for a phy|&s;ician, rather than for any other &s;ort of men. But after he had let him&s;elf loo&s;e into the&s;e fits for near a month, he calmed all on the &s;udden: Perhaps upon &s;ome &s;ignification from the King; for the party complained to their friends in <HI>London,</HI> who had &s;till &s;ome credit at Court.</P>
<P>He called for me all on the &s;udden, and put me in mind of <NOTE PLACE="marg">A farther Indulgence.</NOTE> the project I had laid before him, of putting all the outed Mi|ni&s;ters by couples into pari&s;hes: So that in&s;tead of wandring about the country, to hold Conventicles in all places, they might be fixed to a certain abode, and every one might have the half of a benefice. I was &s;till of the &s;ame mind: And &s;o was <HI>Leightoun;</HI> who compared this to the gathering the coals that were &s;cattered over the hou&s;e, &s;etting it all on fire, into the chimney, where they might burn away &s;afely. Duke <HI>Lauder|dale</HI> &s;et about it immediately: And the benefit of the Indulgence was extended to forty more Churches. This, if followed as to that of doubling them in a pari&s;h, and of confining them with|in their pari&s;hes, would have probably laid a flame that was &s;preading over the Nation, and was like to prove fatal in con|clu&s;ion. But Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s way was, to govern by fits, and to pa&s;s from hot to cold ones, always in extreams. So this of doubling them, which was the chief part of our &s;cheme, was quite neglected. Single Mini&s;ters went into tho&s;e Church|es: And tho&s;e, who were not yet provided for, went about the country holding Conventicles very boldly, without any re&s;traint: And no care at all was taken of the Church.</P>
<P><HI>Sharp</HI> and his in&s;truments took occa&s;ion from this to com|plain, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Leightoun</HI> re&s;olved to retire, and to leave his See.</NOTE> that the Church was ruined by <HI>Leightoun</HI>'s means. And I wanted not my &s;hare in the charge. And indeed the remi&s;&s;|ne&s;s of the government was &s;uch, that there was ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint. Great numbers met in the fields. Men went to tho&s;e meetings with &s;uch arms as they had. And we were blam|ed for all this. It was &s;aid, that things went &s;o far beyond what a principle of moderation could &s;ugge&s;t, that we did cer|tainly de&s;ign to ruine and overturn the con&s;titution. <HI>Leigh|toun</HI> upon all this concluded he could do no good on either &s;ide: He had gained no ground on the Pre&s;byterians, and was &s;u&s;pected and hated by the Epi&s;copal party. So he re&s;olved
<PB N="342" REF="357">
to retire from all publick employments, and to &s;pend the re&s;t of his days in a corner, far from noi&s;e and bu&s;ine&s;s, and to give him&s;elf wholly to prayer and meditation, &s;ince he &s;aw he could not carry on his great de&s;igns of healing and reform|ing the Church, on which he had &s;et his heart. He had ga|thered together many in&s;tances out of Church hi&s;tory of Bi|&s;hops that had left their Sees, and retired from the world: And was much plea&s;ed with the&s;e. He and I had many di&s;cour&s;es on this argument. I thought a man ought to be determined by the providence of God, and to continue in the &s;tation he was in, tho' he could not do all the good in it that he had propo|&s;ed to him&s;elf: He might do good in a private way by his example, and by his labours, more than he him&s;elf could know: And as a man ought to &s;ubmit to &s;ickne&s;s, poverty, or other afflictions, when they are laid on him by the hand of providence; &s;o I thought the labouring without &s;ucce&s;s was in|deed a very great trial of patience, yet &s;uch labouring in an ungrateful employment was a cro&s;s, and &s;o was to be born with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and that a great unea&s;ine&s;s under that, or the for&s;aking a &s;tation becau&s;e of it, might be the effect of &s;ecret pride, and an indignation again&s;t providence. He on the other hand &s;aid, his work &s;eemed to be at an end: He had no more to do, unle&s;s he had a mind to plea&s;e him&s;elf with the lazy enjoying a good revenue. So he could not be wrought on by all that could be laid before him; but followed Duke <HI>Lander|dale</HI> to Court, and begged leave to retire from his Archbi&s;hop|rick. The Duke would by no means con&s;ent to this. So he de|&s;ired, that he might be allowed to do it within a year. Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> thought &s;o much time was gained: So to be rid of his importunities he moved the King to promi&s;e him, that, if he did not change his mind, he would within the year ac|cept of his re&s;ignation. He came back much plea&s;ed with what he had obtained; and &s;aid to me upon it, there was now but one unea&s;y &s;tage between him and re&s;t, and he would wre&s;tle thro' it the be&s;t he could.</P>
<P>And now I am come to the period that I &s;et out for this book. The world was now in a general combu&s;tion, &s;et on by the ambition of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and &s;upported by the feeblene&s;s and treachery of the Court of <HI>England.</HI> A &s;tand was made by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Bran|denburgh.</HI> But the latter, not being in time a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Empe|ror, was forced to accept of &s;uch conditions as he could ob|tain. This winter there was great practice in all the Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> by the Agents of <HI>France,</HI> to lay them every where
<PB N="343" REF="358">
a&s;leep; and to make the world look on their King's de&s;ign in that campaign, as a piece of glory, for the humbling of a rich and proud Common-wealth; and that, as &s;oon as that was done &s;uitably to the dignity of the Great Monarch, he would give peace to the world, after he had &s;hewn that no|thing could &s;tand before his arms. But the opening the pro|gre&s;s of the&s;e negotiations, and the turn that the affairs of <HI>Eu|rope</HI> took, belongs to the next period.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the re&s;t of King <HI>Charles II</HI>'s. reign, from the year 1673 to the year 1685, in which he died.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_HItherto the reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> was pretty &s;e|rene and calm at home. A Nation weary of a <NOTE PLACE="marg">1673. Great jea|lou&s;ies of the King.</NOTE> long civil war was not ea&s;ily brought into jea|lou&s;ies and fears, which were the &s;eeds of di&s;trac|tion, and might end innew confu&s;ions and troubles. But the Court had now given &s;uch broad intima|tions of an ill de&s;ign, both on our religion and the civil con|&s;titution, that it was no more a jealou&s;y: All was now open and barefaced. In the King's pre&s;ence the Court-flatterers were
<PB N="345" REF="360">
always magnifying ab&s;olute government, and reflecting on the in&s;olence of a Hou&s;e of Commons. The King &s;aid once to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> as he told me, that he did not wi&s;h to be like a Grand Signior, with &s;ome mutes about him, and bags of bow|&s;trings to &s;trangle men, as he had a mind to it: But he did not think he was a King, as long as a company of fellows were looking into all his actions, and examining his Mini&s;ters, as well as his accounts. He reckoned, now he had &s;et the Church party at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the Di&s;&s;enters, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to make them join in oppo&s;ition to his de&s;igns. He hoped, the Church party would be always &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive: And he had the Di&s;&s;en|ters at mercy.</P>
<P>The proceedings of the former year had opened all mens eyes. The King's own religion was &s;u&s;pected, as his brother's was declared: And the whole conduct &s;hewed a de&s;ign to go|vern by the <HI>French</HI> model. A <HI>French</HI> General was brought over to command our armies. Count <HI>Schomberg,</HI> who was a <HI>German</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Schomberg</HI> brought to command the Army.</NOTE> by birth, (but his mother was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> woman,) was &s;ent over. He was a firm Prote&s;tant, and &s;erved at fir&s;t in <HI>Holland.</HI> But upon the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s death he went into <HI>France,</HI> where he grew into &s;o high a reputation, that he was kept under, and not rai&s;ed to be a Mar&s;hal, only on the account of his religion. He was a calm man, of great application and conduct. He thought much better than he &s;poke. He was a man of true judgment, of great probity, and of an humble and obliging temper: And at any other time of his life he would have been very acceptable to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> But now he was looked on as one &s;ent over from <HI>France</HI> to bring our army under a <HI>French</HI> di&s;cipline: And &s;o he was hated by the Nation, and not much loved by the Court. He was always pre&s;&s;ing the King to de|clare him&s;elf the head of the Prote&s;tant party. He pre&s;s'd him likewi&s;e to bring his brother over from Popery: But the King &s;aid to him, you know my brother long ago, that he is as &s;tiff as a mule. He liked the way of <HI>Charenton</HI> &s;o well, that he went once a week to <HI>London</HI> to the <HI>French</HI> Church there, that was according to that form: So the Duke and Lord <HI>Clifford</HI> looked on him as a Pre&s;byterian, and an unfit man for their purpo&s;e. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> hated him; for he hoped to have com|manded the Army. And as an army is a very unacceptable thing to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, &s;o it came to be the more odious, when commanded by a General &s;ent over from <HI>France. Schomberg</HI> told me, he &s;aw it was impo&s;&s;ible that the King could bring any great de&s;ign to a good effect: He loved his ea&s;e &s;o much, that he never minded bu&s;ine&s;s: And every thing that was &s;aid
<PB N="346" REF="361">
to him of affairs was heard with &s;o little attention, that it made no impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;try was all broke to pieces. The Duke of <HI>Buckin|gham</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Court was much divided.</NOTE> was alone, hated by all, as he hated all the re&s;t. But he went &s;o entirely into all their ill de&s;igns, that the King con&s;idered him, and either loved or feared him &s;o much, that he had a deep root with him. Lord <HI>Clifford</HI> &s;tuck firm to the Duke, and was heated with the de&s;ign of bringing in Popery, even to en|thu&s;ia&s;m. It was believed, if the de&s;ign had &s;ucceeded, he had agreed with his wife to take orders, and to a&s;pire to a Cardinal's hat. He grew violent; and could &s;carce &s;peak with patience of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and of the Clergy. The Earl of <HI>Ar|lington</HI> thought, that the de&s;ign was now lo&s;t, and that it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the King to make up with his people in the be&s;t man|ner he could. The Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> was re&s;olved to &s;ave him|&s;elf on any terms.</P>
<P>The money was exhau&s;ted: So it was nece&s;&s;ary to have a &s;e&s;&s;ion <NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament.</NOTE> of Parliament. And one was called in the beginning of the year. At the opening it, the King excu&s;ed the i&s;&s;uing out the writs, as done to &s;ave time, and to have a full Hou&s;e at the fir&s;t opening: But he left that matter wholly to them: He &s;poke of the Declara|tion for liberty of con&s;cience in another &s;tyle: He &s;aid, he had &s;een the good effects of it; and that he would &s;tick to it, and maintain it: He &s;aid, he was engaged in a war for the honour of the Nation, and therefore he demanded the &s;upplies that were nece&s;&s;ary to carry it on. On the&s;e heads Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> enlarg|ed. But no part of his &s;peech was more amazing than that, &s;peak|ing of the war with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>Delenda e&s;t Carthago.</HI> Yet, while he made a ba&s;e complying &s;peech in favour of the Court, and of the war, he was in a &s;ecret management with ano|ther party.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons was upon this all in a flame. They <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Declar|ation was voted illegal.</NOTE> &s;aw Popery and &s;lavery lay at the bottom. Yet, that they might not gra&s;p at too much at once, they re&s;olved effectually to break the whole de&s;ign of Popery. They argued the matter of the De|claration; whether it was according to law, or not. It was plainly an annulling of the penal Law, made both again&s;t Papi&s;tsand Di&s;|&s;enters. It was &s;aid, that tho' the King had a power of pardoning, yet he had not a power to authori&s;e men to break laws. This mu&s;t infer a power to alter the whole government. The &s;trength of every law was the penalty laid upon offenders: And, if the King could &s;ecure offenders by indemnifying them before hand, it was a vain thing to make laws; &s;ince by that maxim they had no force, but at the King's di&s;cretion. Tho&s;e who pleaded for the Declara|tion
<PB N="347" REF="362">
pretended to put a difference between penal Laws in &s;piritu|al matters, and all others: And &s;aid, that the King's &s;upremacy &s;eemed to give him a peculiar authority over the&s;e: By vertue of this it was, that the &s;ynagogue of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the <HI>Walloon</HI> Church|es, had been &s;o long tolerated. But to this it was an&s;wered, that the intent of the law in a&s;&s;erting the &s;upremacy was only to ex|clude all foreign juri&s;diction, and to lodge the whole authority with the King: But that was &s;till to be bounded, and regulated by law: And a difference was to be made between a connivance, &s;uch as that the <HI>Jews</HI> lived under, by which they were &s;till at mercy, and a legal authority: The Parliament had never di&s;puted the legality of the Patent for the <HI>Walloon</HI> congregations, which was granted to encou|rage &s;trangers, profe&s;&s;ing the &s;ame religion, to come among us, when they were per&s;ecuted for it in their own country: It was at fir&s;t granted only to &s;trangers: But afterwards in the days of their children, who were natives, it had been made void: And now they were excepted by a &s;pecial clau&s;e out of the Act of Uniformi|ty. The Hou&s;e came quickly to a very unanimous re&s;olution, that the Declaration was again&s;t law. And they &s;et that forth in an addre&s;s to the King, in which they prayed that it might be called in. Some were &s;tudying to divert this, by &s;etting them on to enquire into the i&s;&s;uing out the writs. And the Court &s;eemed willing that the &s;torm &s;hould break on Lord <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> and would have gladly compounded the matter by making him the &s;acrifice. He &s;aw into that; and &s;o was re&s;olved to change &s;ides with the fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e was not content with this: But they brought in a <NOTE PLACE="marg">A bill for a new te&s;t.</NOTE> bill di&s;abling all Papi&s;ts from holding any employment, or place at Court; requiring all per&s;ons in publick tru&s;t to receive the Sa|crament in a pari&s;h Church, and to carry an atte&s;ted certificate of that, with witne&s;&s;es to prove it, into Chancery, or the Coun|ty Se&s;&s;ions; and there to make a declaration renouncing Tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation in full and po&s;itive words. Great pains was taken by the Court to divert this. They propo&s;ed that &s;ome regard might be had to Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, and that their Meetings might be allowed. By this means they hoped to have &s;et them and the Church party into new heats; for now all were united again&s;t Po|pery. <HI>Love</HI> who &s;erved for the city of <HI>London,</HI> and was him&s;elf <NOTE PLACE="marg">The pru|dence of the Di&s;&s;enters.</NOTE> a Di&s;&s;enter, &s;aw what ill effects any &s;uch quarrels might have: So he moved, that an effectual &s;ecurity might be found again&s;t Po|pery, and that nothing might interpo&s;e till that was done. When that was over, then they would try to de&s;erve &s;ome favour: But at pre&s;ent they were willing to lye under the &s;everity of the laws, rather than clog a more nece&s;&s;ary work with their concerns. The
<PB N="348" REF="363">
chief friends of the &s;ects agreed to this. So a vote pa&s;s'd to bring in a bill in favour of Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters, tho' there was not time enough, nor unanimity enough, to fini&s;h one this &s;e&s;&s;ion: For it went no farther than a &s;econd reading, but was dropt in the Committee. But this prudent behaviour of theirs did &s;o &s;often the Church party, that there was no more votes nor bills offered at again&s;t them, even in that angry Parliament, that had been for|merly &s;o &s;evere upon them.</P>
<P>The Court was now in great perplexity. If they gave way to proceedings in the Hou&s;e of Commons, there was a full &s;top put <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</NOTE> to the de&s;ign for Popery: And if they gave not way to it, there was an end of the war. The <HI>French</HI> could not furni&s;h us with &s;o much money, as was nece&s;&s;ary: And the &s;hutting up the Exche|quer had put an end to all credit. The Court tried what could be done in the Hou&s;e of Lords. Lord <HI>Clifford</HI> re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ert the Declaration with all the force, and all the arguments, he could bring for it. He &s;hewed the heads he intended to &s;peak on to the King, who approved of them, and &s;ugge&s;ted &s;ome other hints to him. He began the debate with rough words: He called the vote of the Commons <HI>Mon&s;trum Horrendum Ingens,</HI> and run on in a very high &s;train. He &s;aid all that could be &s;aid, with great heat, and many indecent expre&s;&s;ions. When he had done, the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> to the amazement of the whole Hou&s;e, &s;aid, he mu&s;t differ from the Lord that &s;poke la&s;t <HI>toto coelo.</HI> He &s;aid, while tho&s;e matters were debated out of doors, he might think with others, that the Supremacy, a&s;&s;erted as it was by law, did warrant the Declaration: But now that &s;uch a Hou&s;e of Commons, &s;o loy|al and affectionate to the King were of another mind, he &s;ubmit|ted his rea&s;ons to theirs: They were the King's great Council: They mu&s;t both advi&s;e and &s;upport him: They had done it; and would do it &s;till, if their laws and their religion were once &s;ecure to them. The King was all in fury to be thus for&s;aken by his Chancellor: And told Lord <HI>Clifford,</HI> how well he was plea&s;|ed with his &s;peech, and how highly he was offended with the other. The debate went on, and upon a divi&s;ion the Court had the majority. But again&s;t that vote about thirty of the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable of the Hou&s;e prote&s;ted. So the Court &s;aw, they had gain|ed nothing in carrying a vote, that drew after it &s;uch a prote&s;tation.</P>
<P>This matter took &s;oon after that a quick turn. It had been much debated in the cabinet, what the King &s;hould do. Lord <HI>Clifford</HI> and Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> were for the King's &s;tanding his ground. Sir <HI>Ellis Leightoun</HI> a&s;&s;ured me, that the Duke of <HI>Buck|ingham</HI> and Lord <HI>Berkeley</HI> offered to the King, if he would bring the army to town, that they would take out of both Hou&s;es the
<PB N="349" REF="364">
Members that made the oppo&s;ition. He fancied, the thing might have been ea&s;ily brought about, and that, if the King would have acted with the &s;pirit that he &s;ometimes put on, they might have carried their bu&s;ine&s;s. Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> talked of bringing an ar|my <NOTE PLACE="marg">The variety of opinions in the King's Council.</NOTE> out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and &s;eizing on <HI>Newca&s;tle;</HI> and pre&s;s'd this with as much vehemence, as if he had been able to have execut|ed it. Lord <HI>Clifford</HI> &s;aid to the King, his people did now &s;ee thro' all his de&s;igns: And therefore he mu&s;t re&s;olve to make him|&s;elf ma&s;ter at once, or be for ever &s;ubject to much jealou&s;y and contempt. The Earls of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> and <HI>Arlington</HI> pre&s;&s;ed the King on the other hand to give the Parliament full content: And they undertook to procure him money for carrying on the war: And, if he was &s;ucce&s;sful in that, he might ea&s;ily recover what he mu&s;t in this extremity part with. This &s;uited the King's own temper. Yet the Duke held him in &s;u&s;pence.</P>
<P><HI>Colbert's</HI> brother, <HI>Croi&s;&s;y,</HI> was then the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador here. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> advi&s;e the King to yield to the Parliament.</NOTE> Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him with &s;uch an apprehen&s;ion of the madne&s;s of violent coun&s;els, and that the lea&s;t of the ill effects they might have would be the leaving the war wholly on the <HI>French</HI> King, and that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to carry it on, if the King &s;hould run to &s;uch extremities, as &s;ome were driving him to at home; that he gained him both to pre&s;s the King and his brother to comply with the Parliament, and to &s;end an expre&s;s to his own ma&s;ter, repre&s;enting the whole matter in the light in which Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> had &s;et it before him.</P>
<P>In the afternoon of the day in which the matter had been argu|ed in the Hou&s;e of Lords, the Earls of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> and <HI>Arlington</HI> got all tho&s;e Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons on whom they had any influence, (and who had money from the King, and were his &s;pies, but had leave to vote with the party again&s;t the Court, for procuring them the more credit,) to go privately to him, and to tell him that upon Lord <HI>Clifford</HI>'s &s;peech the Hou&s;e was in &s;uch fury, that probably they would have gone to &s;ome high votes and impeachments: But the Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> &s;peaking on the other &s;ide re&s;trained them: They believed, he &s;poke the King's &s;en&s;e, as the other did the Duke's: This calmed them. So they made the King apprehend, that the Lord Chancellor's &s;peech, with which he had been &s;o much offended, was really a great &s;ervice done him: And they per&s;uaded him farther, that he might now &s;ave him&s;elf, and obtain an indemnity for his Mini&s;ters, if he would part with the Declaration, and pa&s;s the bill. This was &s;o dextrou&s;ly managed <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King went into that &s;udden|ly.</NOTE> by Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> who got a great number of the Members to go one after another to the King, who by concert &s;poke all the &s;ame language, that before night the King was quite changed, and
<PB N="350" REF="365">
&s;aid to his brother, that Lord <HI>Clifford</HI> had undone him&s;elf, and had &s;poiled their bu&s;ine&s;s by his mad &s;peech; and that, tho' Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> had &s;poke like a rogue, yet that had &s;topt a fury which the indi&s;cretion of the other had kindled, to &s;uch a degree that he could &s;erve him no longer. He gave him leave to let him know all this. The Duke was &s;truck with this; and imputed it wholly to Lord <HI>Arlington</HI>'s management. In the evening he told Lord <HI>Clifford</HI> what the King had &s;aid. The Lord <HI>Clifford,</HI> who was na|turally a vehement man, went upon that to the King, who &s;carce knew how to look him in the face. Lord <HI>Clifford</HI> &s;aid, he knew how many enemies he mu&s;t needs make to him&s;elf by his &s;peech in the Hou&s;e of Lords: But he hoped that in it he both &s;erved and plea&s;ed the King, and was therefore the le&s;s concerned in eve|ry thing el&s;e: But he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find by the Duke, that the King was now of another mind. The King was in &s;ome confu|&s;ion: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Clifford di&s;|graced.</NOTE> He owned, that all he had &s;aid was right in it &s;elf: But he &s;aid, that he, who &s;at long in the Hou&s;e of Commons, &s;hould have con&s;idered better what they could bear, and what the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of his affairs required. Lord <HI>Clifford</HI> in his fir&s;t heat was in|clined to have laid down his white &s;taff, and to have expo&s;tulated roundly with the King. But a cooler thought &s;top'd him. He reckoned he mu&s;t now retire: And therefore he had a mind to take &s;ome care of his family in the way of doing it: So he re&s;train|ed him&s;elf; and &s;aid, he was &s;orry that his be&s;t meant &s;ervices were &s;o ill under&s;tood. Soon after this, letters came from the <HI>French</HI> King, pre&s;&s;ing the King to do all that was nece&s;&s;ary to procure money of his Parliament, &s;ince he could not bear the charge of the war alone. He al&s;o writ to the Duke, and excu&s;ed the ad|vice he gave upon the nece&s;&s;ity of affairs; but promi&s;ed faithful|ly to e&s;pou&s;e his concerns, as &s;oon as he got out of the war, and that he would never be ea&s;y, till he recovered that which he was now forced to let go. Some parts of the&s;e tran&s;actions I had from the Duke, and from Duke <HI>Lauderdale:</HI> The re&s;t, that related to the Lord <HI>Clifford, Titus</HI> told me, he had from his own mouth.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Lord <HI>Clifford</HI> &s;aw he mu&s;t loo&s;e the white &s;taff, he went to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who had contributed much to the procuring it to him; and told him, he brought him the fir&s;t notice that he was to lo&s;e that place to which he had helped him, and that he would a&s;&s;i&s;t him to procure it to &s;ome of his friends. After they had talked round all that were in any &s;ort ca|pable of it, and had found great objections to every one of them, they at la&s;t pitched on Sir <HI>Thomas Osborn,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>York|&s;hire,</HI> who&s;e e&s;tate was much &s;unk. He was a very plau&s;ible &s;peak|er, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Osborn</HI> made Lord Trea|&s;urer.</NOTE> but too copious, and could not ea&s;ily make an end of his di&s;|cour&s;e.
<PB N="351" REF="366">
He had been always among the high Cavaliers: And mi&s;|&s;ing preferment he had oppo&s;ed the Court much, and was one of Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s bittere&s;t enemies. He gave him&s;elf great liber|ties in di&s;cour&s;e, and did not &s;eem to have any regard to truth, or &s;o much as to the appearances of it; and was an implacable ene|my: But he had a peculiar way to make his friends depend on him, and to believe he was true to them. He was a po&s;itive, and undertaking man: So he gave the King great ea&s;e, by a&s;&s;uring him all things would go according to his mind in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of Par|liament. And when his hopes failed him, he had always &s;ome ex|cu&s;e ready to put the mi&s;carriage upon. And by this means he got into the highe&s;t degree of confidence with the King, and maintained it the longe&s;t, of all that ever &s;erved him.</P>
<P>The King now went into new mea&s;ures. He called for the Decla|ration, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A great &s;up|ply was giv|en.</NOTE> and ordered the &s;eal put to it to be broken. So the Act for the taking the Sacrament, and the Te&s;t again&s;t Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation went on: And together with it an Act of Grace pa&s;s'd, which was de&s;ired chiefly to cover the Mini&s;try, who were all very obnoxious by their late actings. The Court de&s;ired at lea&s;t 1200000 <HI>l.</HI> for that &s;um was nece&s;&s;ary to the carrying on the war. The great bo|dy of tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the Court had re&s;olved to give only 600000 <HI>l.</HI> which was enough to procure a peace, but not to con|tinue the war. <HI>Garroway</HI> and <HI>Lee</HI> had led the oppo&s;ition to the Court all this &s;e&s;&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of Commons: So they were thought the propere&s;t to name the &s;um. Above eighty of the chief of the party had met over night, and had agreed to name <HI>600000l.</HI> But <HI>Garroway</HI> named 1200000, and was &s;econded in it by <HI>Lee.</HI> So this &s;urpri&s;e gained that great &s;um, which enabled the Court to carry on the war. When their party reproached the&s;e per&s;ons for it, they &s;aid, they had tried &s;ome of the Court as to the &s;um in|tended to be named, who had a&s;&s;ured them, the whole agreement would be broke, if they offered &s;o &s;mall a &s;um: And this made them venture on the double of it. They had good rewards from the Court: And yet they continued &s;till voting on the other &s;ide. They &s;aid, they had got good pennyworths for their money: A &s;ure law again&s;t Popery, which had clau&s;es in it never u&s;ed before; for all that continued in office after the time lap&s;ed, they not tak|ing the Sacrament, and not renouncing Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation (which came to be called the Te&s;t, and the Act from it the Te&s;t Act,) were rendred incapable of holding any office: All the Acts they did in it were declared invalid and illegal, be&s;ides a fine of 500 <HI>l.</HI> to the di&s;coverer. Yet upon that Lord <HI>Cavendi&s;h,</HI> now Duke of <HI>Devon|&s;hire,</HI> &s;aid, that when much money was given to buy a law again&s;t Popery, the force of the money would be &s;tronger in order to the
<PB N="352" REF="367">
bringing it in, than the law could be for keeping it out. I ne|ver knew a thing of this nature carried &s;o &s;uddenly, and &s;o ar|tificially, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, as this was, to the great amaze|ment of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who relied on the Parliament, and did not doubt but that a peace with <HI>England</HI> would be procured by their interpo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Thus this memorable &s;e&s;&s;ion ended. It was indeed much the be&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke laid down all his Com|mi&s;&s;ions.</NOTE> &s;e&s;&s;ion of that long Parliament. The Church party &s;hewed a no|ble zeal for their religion: And the Di&s;&s;enters got great reputation by their &s;ilent deportment. After the &s;e&s;&s;ion was over, the Duke carried all his commi&s;&s;ions to the King, and wept as he deliver|ed them up: But the King &s;hewed no concern at all. Yet he put the Admiralty in a Commi&s;&s;ion compo&s;ed wholly of the Duke's creatures: So that the power of the navy was &s;till in his hands. Lord <HI>Clifford</HI> left the Trea&s;ury, and was &s;ucceeded by <HI>Osborn,</HI> who was &s;oon after made Earl of <HI>Danby.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Shaftshury</HI> had lo&s;t the King's favour quite. But it was not thought fit to lay him a&s;ide, till it &s;hould appear what &s;ervice he could do them in another &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament. Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> had lo&s;t the Duke more than any other. He looked on him as a pitiful coward, who would for&s;ake and betray any thing, rather than run any danger him&s;elf. Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was &s;ent to command the fleet. But the Cap|tains were the Duke's creatures: So they cro&s;s'd him all they could, and complained of everything he did. In a word they &s;aid, he had neither &s;en&s;e nor conduct left. Little could be expected from a fleet &s;o commanded, and &s;o divided. He had two or three engage|ments with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that were well fought on both &s;ides, but were of no great con&s;equence, and were drawn battels. None of the <HI>French</HI> &s;hips engaged, except one, who charged their Admiral for his ill conduct: But, in&s;tead of reward, he was clapt in the <HI>Ba&s;tille</HI> upon his return to <HI>France.</HI> This opened the eyes and mouths of the whole Nation. All men cried out, and &s;aid, we were engaged in a war by the <HI>French,</HI> that they might have the plea|&s;ure to &s;ee the <HI>Dutch</HI> and us de&s;troy one another, while they knew our &s;eas and ports, and learned all our methods, but took care to pre&s;erve them&s;elves. Count <HI>Schomberg</HI> told me, he pre&s;s'd the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador to have the matter examined. Otherwi&s;e, if &s;atisfaction was not given to the Nation, he was &s;ure the next Parlia|ment would break the alliance. But by the Emba&s;&s;ador's coldne&s;s he &s;aw, the <HI>French</HI> Admiral had acted according to his in&s;tructions. So <HI>Schomberg</HI> made ha&s;te to get out of <HI>England,</HI> to prevent an addre&s;s to &s;end him away: And he was by that time as weary of the Court, as the Court was of him.</P>
<P>The Duke was now looking for another wife. He made addre&s;|&s;es <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke treats for a &s;econd mar|riage.</NOTE>
<PB N="353" REF="368">
to the Lady <HI>Bella&s;is,</HI> the widow of the Lord <HI>Bella&s;is</HI>'s &s;on. She was a zealous Prote&s;tant, tho' &s;he was married into a Popi&s;h fami|ly. She was a woman of much life, and great vivacity, but of a very &s;mall proportion of beauty; as the Duke was often ob&s;erved to be led by his amours to objects that had no extraordinary charms. Lady <HI>Bella&s;is</HI> gained &s;o much on the Duke, that he gave her a promi&s;e under his hand to marry her. And he &s;ent <HI>Coleman</HI> to her to draw her over to Popery: But in that &s;he could not be mov|ed. When &s;ome of her friends reproached her for admitting the Duke &s;o freely to &s;ee her, &s;he could not bear it, but &s;aid, &s;he could &s;hew that his addre&s;&s;es to her were honourable. When this came to the Lord <HI>Bella&s;is</HI>'s ears, who was her father in law, and was a zea|lous Papi&s;t, and knew how intractable the Lady was in tho&s;e mat|ters, he gave the whole de&s;ign of bringing in their religion for gone, if that was not quickly broke: So he, pretending a zeal for the King, and the Duke's honor, went and told the King all he had heard. The King &s;ent for the Duke, and told him, it was too much that he had plaid the fool once: That was not to be done a &s;econd time, and at &s;uch an age. The Lady was al&s;o &s;o threatened, that &s;he gave up the promi&s;e, but kept an atte&s;ted co|py of it, as &s;he her &s;elf told me. There was an Archduche&s;s of <HI>In&s;pruck,</HI> to whom marriage was &s;olemnly propo&s;ed: But, the Em|pre&s;s happening to die at that time, the Emperor him&s;elf married her. After that a match was propo&s;ed to the Duke of <HI>Modena</HI>'s daughter, which took effect. But becau&s;e tho&s;e at <HI>Rome</HI> were not willing to con&s;ent to it, unle&s;s &s;he might have a publick Chapel, which the Court would not hearken to, another marriage was pro|po&s;ed for a daughter of the Duke of <HI>Crequi</HI>'s. I &s;aw a long letter of the Duke's writ to Sir <HI>William Lockhart</HI> upon this &s;ubject with great anxiety. He apprehended, if he was not married before the &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, that they would fall on that matter, and li|mit him &s;o, that he &s;hould never be able to marry to his content: He was vexed at the &s;tiffne&s;s of the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> who were de|manding terms that could not be granted: He had &s;ent a po&s;itive order to the Earl of <HI>Peterborough,</HI> who was negotiating the bu&s;i|ne&s;s at <HI>Modena,</HI> to come away by &s;uch a day, if all was not con|&s;ented to: In the mean while he hoped, the King of <HI>France</HI> would not put that mortification on him, as to expo&s;e him to the violence of the Parliament, (I u&s;e his own words;) but that he would give order for di&s;patching that matter with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te. But, while he was thus perplexed, the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> yielded: And &s;o the Duke married that Lady by proxy: And the Earl of <HI>Peter|borough</HI> brought her over thro' <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Swedes</HI> offered at this time a mediation in order to a peace: <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE>
<PB N="354" REF="369">
And <HI>Cologn</HI> was propo&s;ed to be the place of treaty. The King or|dered the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> Sir <HI>Leolin Jenkins,</HI> and Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph William&s;on,</HI> thither, to be his Plenipotentiaries. Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI> was a man of a clear and ready apprehen&s;ion, and a quick deci&s;ion in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord <HI>Sun|derland</HI>'s character.</NOTE> bu&s;ine&s;s. He had too much heat both of imagination and pa&s;&s;ion, and was apt to &s;peak very freely both of per&s;ons and things. His own notions were always good: But he was a man of great expence. And, in order to the &s;upporting him&s;elf, he went into the prevail|ing coun&s;els at Court: And he changed &s;ides often, with little re|gard either to religion, or the intere&s;t of his country. He rai&s;ed many enemies to him&s;elf by the contempt with which he treated tho&s;e who differed from him. He had indeed the &s;uperior genius to all the men of bu&s;ine&s;s that I have yet known. And he had the dexterity of in&s;inuating him&s;elf &s;o entirely into the greate&s;t degree of confidence with three &s;ucceeding Princes, who &s;et up on very different intere&s;ts, that he came by this to lo&s;e him&s;elf &s;o much, that even tho&s;e who e&s;teemed his parts, depended little on his firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>The treaty of <HI>Cologn</HI> was of a &s;hort continuance: For the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The treaty $word$ $word$.</NOTE> Emperor, looking on <HI>Fur&s;tenberg,</HI> the Dean of <HI>Cologn,</HI> and Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> afterwards advanced to be Cardinal, who was the Elector's Plenipotentiary at that treaty, as a &s;ubject of the Em|pire, who had betrayed it, ordered him to be &s;eized on. The <HI>French</HI> look'd on this as &s;uch a violation of the pa&s;s-ports, that they &s;et it up for a preliminary, before they would enter upon a treaty, to have him &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P><HI>Ma&s;tricht</HI> was taken this &s;ummer; in which the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf &s;o eminently, that he was much con|&s;idered upon it. The King of <HI>France</HI> was there. After the tak|ing of <HI>Ma&s;tricht</HI> he went to <HI>Nancy</HI> in <HI>Lorraine,</HI> and left the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> with the army in <HI>Flanders, Turenne</HI> having the command of that on the upper <HI>Rhine</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Germans;</HI> for the Emperor and the whole Empire were now engaged.</P>
<P>But I return now to the intrigues of our Court. I came up this <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> &s;ummer, in order to the publi&s;hing the Memoirs of the Dukes of <HI>Hamilton.</HI> I had left <HI>Scotland</HI> under an univer&s;al di&s;content. The whole admini&s;tration there was both violent and corrupt, and &s;eemed to be formed on a <HI>French</HI> model. The Parliament had in the year 1663, in order to the bringing our trade to a balance with <HI>England,</HI> given the King in tru&s;t a power to lay impo&s;itions on foreign commodities. So upon that a great duty was lately laid up|on <HI>French</HI> &s;alt, in order to the better vending the &s;alt made at home: Upon which it was &s;old very dear. And that rai&s;ed great complaints: For, as the &s;alt was exce&s;&s;ive dear, &s;o it did not &s;erve
<PB N="355" REF="370">
all purpo&s;es. All people looked on this, as the beginning of a ga|bel. An impo&s;ition was al&s;o laid on <HI>Tobacco:</HI> And all brandy was prohibited to be imported, but not to be retailed: So tho&s;e who had the grant of the &s;eizures &s;old them, and rai&s;ed the price very much. The&s;e occa&s;ioned monopolies: And the price of tho&s;e things that were of great con&s;umption among the Commons was much rai&s;ed: So that a tru&s;t lodged with the Crown was now abu|&s;ed in the highe&s;t degree. As the&s;e things provoked the body of the people, &s;o Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s in&s;olence, and his engro&s;&s;ing every thing to him&s;elf, and to a few of his friends, and his wife and his brother &s;etting all things to &s;ale, rai&s;ed a very high di&s;con|tent all over the Nation. The affairs of the Church were altoge|ther neglected: So that in all re&s;pects we were quite out of joint.</P>
<P>I went up with a full re&s;olution to do my country all the &s;ervice I could, and to deal very plainly with the Duke of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> re&s;olving if I could do no good, to retire from all affairs, and to meddle no more in publick bu&s;ine&s;s. I lo&s;t indeed my be&s;t friend at Court. Sir <HI>Robert Murray</HI> died &s;uddenly at that time. He was the wi&s;e&s;t, and worthie&s;t man of the age, and was as another fa|ther to me. I was &s;en&s;ible how much I lo&s;t in &s;o critical a con|juncture, being bereft of the true&s;t and faithfulle&s;t friend I had ever known: And &s;o I &s;aw, I was in danger of committing great errors for want of &s;o kind a monitor.</P>
<P>At my coming to Court, Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> took me into his <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s de&s;ign.</NOTE> clo&s;et, and a&s;ked me the &s;tate of <HI>Scotland.</HI> I upon that gave him a very punctual and true account of it. He &s;eemed to think that I aggravated matters; and a&s;ked me, if the King &s;hould need an ar|my from <HI>Scotland</HI> to tame tho&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> whether that might be depended on? I told him, certainly not: The Commons in the &s;outhern parts were all Pre&s;byterians: And the Nobility thought they had been ill u&s;ed, and were generally di&s;contented, and on|ly waited for an occa&s;ion to &s;hew it. He &s;aid, he was of another mind: The hope of the &s;poil of <HI>England</HI> would fetch them all in. I an&s;wer'd, the King was ruined if ever he tru&s;ted to that: And I added, that with relation to other more indifferent per&s;ons, who might be otherwi&s;e ready enough to pu&s;h their fortunes without any anxious enquiries into the grounds they went on, yet even the&s;e would not tru&s;t the King, &s;ince he had &s;o lately &s;aid, he would &s;tick to his Declaration, and yet had &s;o &s;oon after given it up. He &s;aid, <HI>Hinc illae Lacrymae:</HI> But the King was for&s;aken in that mat|ter, for none &s;tuck to him but Lord <HI>Clifford,</HI> and him&s;elf: And then he &s;et him&s;elf into a fit of railing at Lord <HI>Shaftsbury.</HI> I was &s;truck with this conver&s;ation: And by it I clearly &s;aw into the de&s;|perate de&s;igns of the Court, which were as fooli&s;h, as they were
<PB N="356" REF="371">
wicked: For I knew, that upon the lea&s;t di&s;order in <HI>England</HI> they were ready in <HI>Scotland</HI> to have broke out into a rebellion: So far were they from any inclination to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted the King in the ma&s;tering of <HI>England.</HI> I was much perplexed in my &s;elf what I ought to do, whether I ought not to have tried to give the King a truer view of our affairs: But I re&s;olved to &s;tay for a fit opportu|nity. I tried the Duche&s;s of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> and &s;et before her the inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion that <HI>Scotland</HI> was groaning under: But I &s;aw &s;he got too much by it to be any way concerned at it. They talked of going down to hold a &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament in <HI>Scotland:</HI> I warned them of their danger. But they de&s;pi&s;ed all I could &s;ay: Only great offers were made to my &s;elf, to make me wholly theirs, which made no impre&s;&s;ion on me.</P>
<P>He carried me to the King, and propo&s;ed the licen&s;ing my Me|moirs to him. The King bid me bring them to him; and &s;aid, he <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King liked my Memoirs.</NOTE> would read them him&s;elf. He did read &s;ome parts of them, par|ticularly the account I gave of the ill conduct of the Bi&s;hops, that occa&s;ioned the beginning of the wars; and told me, that he was well plea&s;ed with it. He was at that time &s;o much offended with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops for oppo&s;ing the toleration, that he &s;eemed much &s;harpened again&s;t them. He gave me back my book to car|ry it to Secretary <HI>Coventry,</HI> in order to the licen&s;ing it. The Se|cretary &s;aid, he would read it all him&s;elf: So this obliged me to a longer &s;tay than I intended. Sir <HI>Ellis Leightoun</HI> carried me to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> with whom I pa&s;s'd almo&s;t a whole night; and happened &s;o far to plea&s;e him, that he, who was apt to be fired with a new acquaintance, gave &s;uch a character of me to the King, that ever after that he took much notice of me, and &s;aid, he would hear me preach. He &s;eemed well plea&s;ed with my &s;er|mon; and &s;poke of it in a &s;train that drew much envy on me.</P>
<P>He ordered me to be &s;worn a Chaplain, and admitted me to <NOTE PLACE="marg">And &s;hewed me great $a|vour.</NOTE> a long private audience, that la&s;ted above an hour, in which I took all the freedom with him that I thought became my pro|fe&s;&s;ion. He run me into a long di&s;cour&s;e about the authority of the Church, which he thought we made much of in our di&s;putes with the Di&s;&s;enters, and then took it all away when we dealt with the Papi&s;ts. I &s;aw plainly what he aimed at in this: And I quick|ly convinced him, that there was a great difference between an authority of government in things indifferent, and a pretence to infallibility. He complained heavily of the Bi&s;hops for neglect|ing the true concerns of the Church, and following Courts &s;o much, and being &s;o engaged in parties. I went thro' &s;ome other things with relation to his cour&s;e of life, and entred into many par|ticulars with much freedom. He bore it all very well; and thank'd
<PB N="357" REF="372">
me for it: Some things he freely condemned, &s;uch as living with another man's wife: Other things he excu&s;ed, and thought God would not damn a man for a little irregular plea&s;ure. He &s;eem|ed to take all I had &s;aid very kindly: And during my &s;tay at Court he u&s;ed me in &s;o particular a manner, that I was con&s;idered as a man growing into a high degree of favour.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time Lord <HI>Ancram,</HI> a <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Earl, but of a &s;mall <NOTE PLACE="marg">My conver|&s;ation with the Duke.</NOTE> fortune, and of no principles, either as to religion or vertue, who&s;e wife was a Papi&s;t, and him&s;elf a member of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, told the Duke that I had a great intere&s;t in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and might do him &s;ervice in that Kingdom. He depended on Duke <HI>Lauderdale;</HI> but hated him, becau&s;e he did nothing for him. We were acquainted there: And, he having &s;tudied the mo&s;t divinity of any man of quality I ever knew, we found many &s;ubjects of di&s;|cour&s;e. He &s;aw, I did not flatter Duke <HI>Lauderdale:</HI> And he fanci|ed he might make a tool of me. So he &s;eemed to wonder that I had not been carried to wait on the Duke; and brought me a me&s;|&s;age from him, that he would be glad to &s;ee me: And upon that he carried me to him. The Duke received me very graciou&s;ly. Lord <HI>Ancram</HI> had a mind to engage me to give him an account of the affairs of <HI>Scotland:</HI> But I avoided that, and very bluntly en|tred into much di&s;cour&s;e with him about matters of religion. He &s;aid &s;ome of the common things, of the nece&s;&s;ity of having but one Church, otherwi&s;e we &s;aw what &s;warms of &s;ects did ri&s;e up on our revolt from <HI>Rome,</HI> and the&s;e had rai&s;ed many rebellions, and the &s;hedding much blood: And he named both his father's death, and his great grandmother's, <HI>Mary</HI> Queen of <HI>Scots:</HI> He al&s;o turned to &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Heylin</HI>'s hi&s;tory of the Reforma|tion, which he had lying by him: And the pa&s;&s;ages were mark|ed, to &s;hew upon what motives and principles men were led in|to the changes that were then made. I enlarged upon all the&s;e particulars; and &s;hewed him the progre&s;s that ignorance and &s;u|per&s;tition had made in many dark ages, and how much blood&s;hed was occa&s;ioned by the Papal preten&s;ions, for all which the opini|on of infallibility was a &s;ource never to be exhau&s;ted. And I &s;poke long to &s;uch things as were be&s;t &s;uited to his temper, and his ca|pacity. I &s;aw Lord <HI>Ancram</HI> helped him all he could, by which I perceived how he made his Court; for which when I reproached him afterwards, he &s;aid, it was ill breeding in me to pre&s;s &s;o hard on a Prince. The Duke upon this conver&s;ation expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch a liking to me, that he ordered me to come oft to him: And af|terwards he allowed me to come to him in a private way, as oft as I plea&s;ed. He de&s;ired to know the &s;tate of affairs in <HI>Scotland.</HI> I told him how little that Kingdom could be depended on. I turn|ed
<PB N="358" REF="373">
the di&s;cour&s;e often to matters of religion. He broke it very gently; for he was not at all rough in private conver&s;ation. He wi&s;h|ed, I would let tho&s;e matters alone: I might be too hard for him, and &s;ilence him, but I could never convince him. I told him, it was a thing he could never an&s;wer to God nor the world, that, being born and baptized in our Church, and having his father's la&s;t orders to continue &s;tedfa&s;t in it, he had &s;uffered him&s;elf to be &s;educed, and as it were &s;tollen out of it, hearing only one &s;ide, without offering his &s;cruples to our divines, or hearing what they had to &s;ay in an&s;wer to them; and that he was now &s;o fixed in his Popery, that he would not &s;o much as examine the matter. He &s;aid to me, he had often picqueered out (that was his word) on <HI>Sheldon,</HI> and &s;ome other Bi&s;hops; by who&s;e an&s;wers he could not but conclude, that they were much nearer the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> than &s;ome of us young men were.</P>
<P><HI>Stilling fleet</HI> had a little before this time publi&s;hed a book of the idolatry and fanatici&s;m of the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> Upon that the Duke &s;aid, he a&s;ked <HI>Sheldon,</HI> if it was the doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that Roman Catholicks were idolaters: Who an&s;wer|ed him, it was not; but that young men of parts would be popu|lar; and &s;uch a charge was the way to it. He at that time &s;hew|ed me the Duche&s;s's paper, that has been &s;ince printed: It was all writ with her own hand. He gave me leave to read it twice over: But would not &s;uffer me to copy it. And upon the mention made in it of her having &s;poke to Bi&s;hops concerning &s;ome of her &s;cruples, and that &s;he had &s;uch an&s;wers from them, as confirmed and heightened them, I went from him to <HI>Morley,</HI> as was &s;aid for|merly, and had from him the an&s;wer there &s;et down. I a&s;ked the <NOTE PLACE="marg">I carried Doctor <HI>Stil|ling fleet</HI> to him.</NOTE> Duke's leave to bring Doctor <HI>Stilling fleet</HI> to him. He was aver&s;e to it; and &s;aid, it would make much noi&s;e, and could do no good. I told him, even the noi&s;e would have a good effect: It would &s;hew he was not &s;o ob&s;tinate, but that he was willing to hear our di|vines. I pre&s;&s;ed it much: For it became nece&s;&s;ary to me, on my own account, to clear my &s;elf from the &s;u&s;picion of Popery, which this extraordinary favour had drawn upon me. I at la&s;t pre|vailed with the Duke to con&s;ent to it: And he a&s;&s;igned an hour of audience. <HI>Stilling fleet</HI> went very readily, tho' he had no hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. We were about two hours with him, and went over mo&s;t of the points of controver&s;y. <HI>Stilling fleet</HI> thought, the point that would go the ea&s;ie&s;t, and be the be&s;t under&s;tood by him, was the Papal preten&s;ions to a power over Princes, in depo&s;ing them, and giving their dominions to others: And upon that, he &s;hewed him, that Popery was calculated to make the Pope the &s;overeign of all Chri&s;tendom. The Duke &s;hifted the di&s;cour&s;e from
<PB N="359" REF="374">
one point to another; and did not &s;eem to believe the matters of fact, and hi&s;tory alledged by us. So we de&s;ired, he would call for &s;ome Prie&s;ts, and hear us di&s;cour&s;e of tho&s;e matters with them in his pre&s;ence. He declined this; and &s;aid, it would make a noi&s;e. He a&s;&s;ured us, he de&s;ired nothing, but to follow his own con|&s;cience, which he impo&s;ed on no body el&s;e, and that he would never attempt to alter the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion. He loved to repeat this often. But when I was alone with him, I warned him of the great difficulties his religion was like to ca&s;t him into. This was no good argument to make him change: But it was certain|ly a very good argument to make him con&s;ider the matter &s;o well, that he might be &s;ure he was in the right. He objected to me the doctrine of the Church of <HI>England</HI> in the point of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and of pa&s;&s;ive obedience. I told him, there was no tru&s;ting to a di&s;|putable opinion: There were al&s;o di&s;tinctions and re&s;erves, even in tho&s;e who had a&s;&s;erted the&s;e points the mo&s;t: And it was ve|ry certain, that when men &s;aw a vi&s;ible danger of being fir&s;t un|done, and then burnt, they would be inclined to the &s;horte&s;t way of arguing, and to &s;ave them&s;elves the be&s;t way they could: In|tere&s;t and &s;elf-pre&s;ervation were powerful motives. He did very often a&s;&s;ure me, he was again&s;t all violent methods, and all per|&s;ecution for con&s;cience &s;ake, and was better furni&s;hed to &s;peak well on that head, than on any other. I told him, all he could &s;ay that way would do him little &s;ervice: For the words of Princes were looked on as arts to lay men a&s;leep: And they had generally re|garded them &s;o little them&s;elves, that they ought not to expect that others &s;hould have great regard to them. I added, he was now of a religion, in which others had the keeping of his con|&s;cience, who would now hide from him this point of their religi|on, &s;ince it was not &s;afe to own it, till they had it in their pow|er to put it in practice: And whenever that time &s;hould come, I was &s;ure, that the principles of their Church mu&s;t carry him to all the extremities of extirpation. I carried a volume of Judge <HI>Crook</HI>'s to him, in which it is reported, that King <HI>James</HI> had once in Council complained of a &s;lander ca&s;t on him, as if he was in|clined to change his religion; and had &s;olemnly vindicated him|&s;elf from the imputation; and prayed, that if any &s;hould ever &s;pring out of his loins that &s;hould maintain any other religion than that which he truly maintained and profe&s;&s;ed, that God would take him out of the world. He read it: But it made no impre&s;&s;ion. And when I urged him with &s;ome things in his father's book, he gave me the account of it that was formerly mentioned. He entered into great freedom with me about all his affairs: And he &s;hewed me the journals he took of bu&s;ine&s;s every day with his
<PB N="360" REF="375">
own hand: A method he &s;aid, that the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> had &s;et him on. The Duche&s;s had begun to write his life. He &s;hewed me a part of it in a thin volume in folio. I read &s;ome of it, and found it writ with a great deal of &s;pirit. He told me, he intended to tru&s;t me with his journals, that I might draw a hi&s;tory out of them. And thus, in a few weeks time, I had got far into his con|fidence. He did al&s;o allow me to &s;peak to him of the irregulari|ties of his life, &s;ome of which he very freely confe&s;&s;ed: And when I urged him, how &s;uch a cour&s;e of life did agree with the zeal he &s;hewed in his religion; he an&s;wered, mu&s;t a man be of no re|ligion, unle&s;s he is a &s;aint? Yet he bore my freedon very gently, and &s;eemed to like me the better for it. My favour with him grew to be the ob&s;ervation of the whole Court. Lord <HI>Ancram</HI> &s;aid, I might be what I plea&s;ed, if I would be a little &s;ofter in the points of religion. Sir <HI>Ellis Leightoun</HI> brought me a me&s;&s;age from F. <HI>Sheldon,</HI> and &s;ome of his Prie&s;ts, a&s;&s;uring me, they heard &s;o well of me, that they offered me their &s;ervice. He pre&s;&s;ed me to im|prove my pre&s;ent advantages to the making my fortune: The See of <HI>Durham</HI> was then vacant: And he was confident, it would be no hard matter for me to compa&s;s it. But I had none of tho&s;e views, and &s;o was not moved by them. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> a&s;ked me, what I meant in being &s;o much about the Duke? If I fancied I could change him in point of religion, I knew him and the world very little: If I had a mind to rai&s;e my &s;elf, a &s;ure method for that was, to talk to him of the Reformation, as a thing done in heat and ha&s;te, and that in a calmer time it might be fit to re|view it all. He &s;aid, I needed go no farther; for &s;uch an inti|mation would certainly rai&s;e me. And when I was po&s;itive not to enter into &s;uch a compliance, he told me, he knew Courts better than I did: Princes thought their favours were no ordinary things: They expected great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions in return: Otherwi&s;e they thought they were de&s;pi&s;ed: And I would feel the ill effects of the favour I then had, if I did not &s;trike into &s;ome compliances: And, &s;ince I was re&s;olved again&s;t the&s;e, he advi&s;ed me to withdraw from the Court; the &s;ooner the better. I imputed this to his hatred of the Duke: But I found afterwards the advice was &s;ound and good. I likewi&s;e &s;aw tho&s;e things in the Duke's temper, from which I concluded, I could not maintain an intere&s;t in him long. He was for &s;ubjects &s;ubmitting in all things to the King's notions; and thought, that all who oppo&s;ed him, or his Mini&s;ters in Parlia|ment, were rebels in their hearts; and he hated all popular things, as below the dignity of a King. He was much &s;harpened at that time by the proceedings of the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>In the former &s;e&s;&s;ion it was known, that he was treating a mar|riage <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke's marriage op|po&s;ed by the Commons.</NOTE>
<PB N="361" REF="376">
with the Archduche&s;s: And yet no addre&s;s was made to the King to hinder his marrying a Papi&s;t. His honour was not then engaged: So it had been &s;ea&s;onable, and to good purpo&s;e to have moved in it then. But now he was married by proxy, and Lord <HI>Peterborough</HI> had brought the Lady to <HI>Paris.</HI> Yet the Hou&s;e of Commons re&s;olved to follow the pattern the King of <HI>France</HI> had lately &s;et. He treated with the Elector Palatine for a marriage be|tween his brother and the Elector's daughter; in which one of the conditions agreed to was, that &s;he &s;hould enjoy the freedom of her religion, and have a private Oratory for the exerci&s;e of it. When &s;he came on her way as far as <HI>Metz,</HI> an order was &s;ent to &s;top her, till &s;he was better in&s;tructed: Upon which &s;he changed, at lea&s;t as to outward appearance. It is true, the Court of <HI>France</HI> gave it out that the Elector had con&s;ented to this method, for the &s;aving his own honour. And he had given the world cau&s;e to be|lieve, he was capable of that, tho' he continued openly to deny it. The Hou&s;e of Commons re&s;olved to follow this precedent, and to make an addre&s;s to the King, to &s;top the Prince&s;s of <HI>Modena</HI>'s coming to <HI>England,</HI> till &s;he &s;hould change her religion. Upon this the Duke moved the King to prorogue the Parliament for a week: And a Commi&s;&s;ion was ordered for it. The Duke went to the Hou&s;e on that day, to pre&s;s the calling up the Commons be|fore they could have time to go on to bu&s;ine&s;s. Some Peers were to be brought in. The Duke pre&s;&s;ed Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> to put that off, and to prorogue the Parliament. He &s;aid coldly to him, there was no ha&s;te. But the Commons made more ha&s;te: For they quick|ly came to a vote for &s;topping the marriage. And by this means they were engaged, (having put &s;uch an affront on the Duke,) to proceed farther. He pre&s;ently told me, how the matter went, and how the Lord Chancellor had u&s;ed him: He was confident the King would take the Seals from him, if he could not manage the &s;e&s;&s;ions &s;o as to procure him money, of which there was in|deed &s;mall appearance. I told him, I looked on that as a fatal thing, if the Commons began once to affront him: That would have a &s;ad train of con&s;equences, as &s;oon as they thought it nece&s;|&s;ary for their own pre&s;ervation to &s;ecure them&s;elves from falling under his revenges. He &s;aid, he was re&s;olved to &s;tand his ground, and to &s;ubmit to the King in every thing: He would never take off an enemy: But he would let all the world &s;ee, that he was ready to forgive every one, that &s;hould come off from his oppo&s;ition, and make applications to him. When the week of the prorogation was ended, the &s;e&s;&s;ion was opened by a &s;peech of the King's, which had &s;uch various &s;trains in it, that it was plain it was made by different per&s;ons. The Duke told me, that Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>
<PB N="362" REF="377">
during his favour, had penned all the King's &s;peeches; but that now they were compo&s;ed in the Cabinet, one Mini&s;ter putting in one period, while another made another; &s;o that all was not of a piece. He told me, Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> was almo&s;t dead with fear: But Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> reckoned him&s;elf gone at Court, and acted more roundly. In his &s;peech he &s;tudied to correct his <HI>De|lenda e&s;t Carthago,</HI> applying it to the <HI>Loeve&s;tein</HI> party, whom he called the <HI>Carthaginians:</HI> But this made him as ridiculous, as the other had made him odious. The Hou&s;e of Commons took up again the matter of the Duke's marriage, and moved for an ad|dre&s;s about it. But it was &s;aid, the King's honour was engaged. Yet they addre&s;&s;ed to him again&s;t it. But the King made them no an&s;wer. By that time I had obtained a licence of Secretary <HI>Coven|try</HI> for my book, which the King &s;aid &s;hould be printed at his charge.</P>
<P>But now I mu&s;t give an account of a &s;torm rai&s;ed again&s;t my &s;elf, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment in <HI>Scot|land.</HI></NOTE> the effects of which were very &s;en&s;ible to me for many years. The Duke of <HI>Landerdale</HI> had kept the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Nation in &s;uch a depen|dance on him&s;elf, that he was not plea&s;ed with any of them that made any acquaintance in <HI>England,</HI> and lea&s;t of all in the Court: Nor could he endure, that any of them &s;hould apply them&s;elves to the King, or the Duke, but thro' him. So he looked on the favour I had got into with a very jealous eye. His Duche&s;s que|&s;tioned me about it. Tho&s;e who know what Court jealou&s;ies are will ea&s;ily believe, that I mu&s;t have &s;aid &s;omewhat to &s;atisfy them, or break with them. I told her, what was very true as to the Duke, that my conver&s;ation with him was about religion; and that with the King I had talked of the cour&s;e of life he led. I ob&s;erved a deep jealou&s;y of me in them both; e&s;pecially, becau&s;e I could not go with them to <HI>Scotland.</HI> I &s;aid, I would follow, as &s;oon as the Secretary would di&s;patch me. And as &s;oon as that was done I took po&s;t, and by a great fall of &s;now was &s;topt by the way. But I un|happily got to <HI>Edenburgh</HI> the Night before the Parliament met. Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and many others, told me how &s;trangely Duke <HI>Landerdale</HI> talked of my intere&s;t at Court; as if I was ready to turn Papi&s;t. Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> al&s;o told me, they were re&s;olved next day to attack Duke <HI>Landerdale,</HI> and his whole admini&s;tration in Parliament. I was troubled at this; and argued with him again&s;t the fitne&s;s of it all I could. But he &s;aid he was engaged: The Earls of <HI>Rothes, Argile,</HI> and <HI>Tweedale,</HI> and all the Cavalier par|ty, had promi&s;ed to &s;tick by him. I told him, what afterwards hap|pened, that mo&s;t of the&s;e would make their own terms, and leave him in the lurch: And the load would lye on him. When I &s;aw the thing was pa&s;t remedy, I re&s;olved to go home, and follow
<PB N="363" REF="378">
my &s;tudies; &s;ince I could not keep Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> and him any longer in a good under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Next day, when the Parliament was opened, the King's letter <NOTE PLACE="marg">A party formed a|gain&s;t <HI>Lau|derdale.</HI></NOTE> was read, de&s;iring their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in carrying on the war with <HI>Hol|land,</HI> and a&s;&s;uring them of his affection to them in very kind words. This was &s;econded by Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> in a long &s;peech. And im|mediately it was moved to appoint a Committee to prepare an an&s;wer to the King's letter, as was u&s;ual. Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> moved, that the &s;tate of the Nation might be fir&s;t con&s;idered, that &s;o they might &s;ee what grievances they had: And he hinted at &s;ome. And then, as it had been laid, about twenty men, one after another, &s;poke to &s;everal particulars. Some mentioned the &s;alt, others the tobacco, and the brandy: Some complained of the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and others of the coin. With this the Duke of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was &s;truck, as one dead; for he had rai&s;ed his credit at Court by the opinion of his having all <HI>Scotland</HI> in his hand, and in a dependance on him: So a di&s;covery of this want of credit with us he &s;aw mu&s;t &s;ink him there. He had not looked for this; tho' I had warned him of a great deal of it. But he reflecting on that, and on the credit I had got at Court, and on the ha&s;te I made in my journey, and my coming critically the night before the &s;e&s;&s;ion opened; he laid all this together, and fancied I was &s;ent upon de&s;ign, as the agent of the party, and that the licen&s;ing my book was only a blind: He believed Sir <HI>Robert Murray</HI> had laid it, and that the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> had managed it. And becau&s;e it was a common arti|fice of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s Mini&s;ters, to put the mi&s;carriage of affairs up|on &s;ome accident that had not been fore&s;een by them, but &s;hould be provided again&s;t for the future; he a&s;&s;ured the King, that I had been the incendiary, that I had my uncle's temper in me, and that I mu&s;t be &s;ubdued, otherwi&s;e I would embroil all his affairs. The King took all things of that kind ea&s;ily from his Mini&s;ters, without hearing any thing to the contrary: For he was wont to &s;ay, all apologies were lies: Upon which one &s;aid to him once, then he would always believe the fir&s;t lye. But all this was much encrea&s;ed, when Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> upon his coming up told the King, that I had boa&s;ted to his wife of the freedom that I had u&s;ed with him upon his cour&s;e of life. With this the King was highly offended: Or at lea&s;t he made much u&s;e of it, to ju&s;tify many hard things that he &s;aid of me: And for many years he allowed him&s;elf a very free &s;cope in talking of me. I was certainly to blame for the freedom I had u&s;ed with the Duche&s;s of <HI>Lauderdale:</HI> But I was &s;urprized by her que&s;tion: And I could not bring my &s;elf to tell a lye: So I had no other &s;hift ready to &s;atisfy her. But the Duke kept up &s;till a very good opinion of me. I went home to <HI>Gla&s;cow,</HI>
<PB N="364" REF="379">
where I pro&s;ecuted my &s;tudies till the <HI>June</HI> following, when I went again to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> put off the &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament for &s;ome time; <NOTE PLACE="marg">He offers to redre&s;s grie|vances in Council.</NOTE> and called a Council, in which he &s;aid, great complaints had been made in Parliament of grievances: He had full authority to redre&s;s them all in the King's name: Therefore he charged the Privy Coun|&s;ellors to lay all things of that kind before that board, and not to carry them before any other a&s;&s;embly, till they &s;aw what redre&s;s was to be had there. Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> &s;aid, the regular way of com|plaints was to make them in Parliament, which only could redre&s;s them effectually; &s;ince the putting them down by the authority of Council, was only laying them a&s;ide for a while, till a fitter op|portunity was found to take them up again. Upon this Duke <HI>Lau|derdale</HI> prote&s;ted, that he was ready in the King's name to give the &s;ubject ea&s;e and freedom, and that tho&s;e who would not a&s;&s;i&s;t and concur with him in this were wanting in duty and re&s;pect to the King; and &s;ince he &s;aw the matter of the &s;alt, the tobacco, and the brandy, had rai&s;ed much clamour, he would qua&s;h the&s;e. But the party had a mind to have the in&s;truments of their oppre&s;&s;ion puni&s;hed, as well as the oppre&s;&s;ion it&s;elf removed; and were re&s;olved to have the&s;e things condemned by &s;ome exemplary puni&s;hments, and to pur&s;ue Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> and his party with this clamour.</P>
<P>Next &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament new complaints were offered. Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> &s;aid, the&s;e ought to be made fir&s;t to the Lords of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">1674. A di&s;pute rai&s;ed about the Lords of the Articles.</NOTE> Articles, to whom all petitions and motions ought to be made fir&s;t; and that they were the only Judges, what matters were fit to be brought into Parliament. The other &s;ide &s;aid, they were only a Committee of Parliament, to put motions into the form of Acts; but that the Parliament had &s;till an entire authority to examine in|to the &s;tate of the Nation. In this debate, they had the rea&s;on of things on their &s;ide: But the words of the Act favoured Duke <HI>Lau|derdale.</HI> So he lodged it now where he wi&s;hed it might be, in a point of prerogative. He valued him&s;elf to the King on this, that he had drawn the Act that &s;ettled the power of the Lords of the Ar|ticles; who being all upon the matter named by the King, it was of great concern to him to maintain that, as the check upon facti|ous &s;pirits there; which would be no &s;ooner let go, than the Par|liament of <HI>Scotland</HI> would grow as unquiet, as a Hou&s;e of Com|mons was in <HI>England:</HI> That was a con&s;ideration which at this time had great weight with the King. I now return to give an account of this year's &s;e&s;&s;ion in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In the beginning of it, the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> the Earls of <HI>Shafts|bury,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The pro|ceedings in the Parlia|ment of <HI>En|gland.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Arlington,</HI> and Secretary <HI>Coventry,</HI> offered an advice to
<PB N="365" REF="380">
the King, for &s;ending the Duke for &s;ome time from the Court, as a good expedient both for him&s;elf and the Duke. The King heark|ened &s;o far to it, that he &s;ent them to move it to the Duke. He was highly incen&s;ed at it: He &s;aid, he would obey all the King's or|ders, but would look on tho&s;e as his enemies, who offered him &s;uch advices. And he never forgave this to any of them; no not to <HI>Co|ventry,</HI> for all his good opinion of him. He pre&s;&s;ed the King ve|hemently to take the &s;eals from the Earl of <HI>Sha&s;tsbury.</HI> So it was done: And they were given to <HI>Finch,</HI> then Attorney General, made afterwards Earl of <HI>Nottingham.</HI> He was a man of probity, and well <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Finch</HI>'s cha|racter.</NOTE> ver&s;ed in the laws. He was long much admired for his eloquence: But it was laboured and affected: And he &s;aw it as much de&s;pi&s;ed be|fore he died. He had no &s;ort of knowledge in foreign affairs: And yet he loved to talk of them perpetually: By which he expo&s;ed him&s;elf to tho&s;e who under&s;tood them. He thought he was bound to ju&s;tify the Court in all debates in the Hou&s;e of Lords, which he did with the vehemence of a pleader, rather than with the &s;olem|nity of a &s;enator. He was an incorrupt Judge: And in his Court he could re&s;i&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t applications even from the King him|&s;elf, tho' he did it no where el&s;e. He was too eloquent on the bench, in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and in common conver&s;ation. One thing de&s;erves to be remembred of him: He took great care of filling the Church livings that belonged to the Seal with worthy men: And he obliged them all to re&s;idence. Lord <HI>Sha&s;tsbury</HI> was now at liberty to open him&s;elf again&s;t the Court; which he did with as little re&s;erve as decency.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons were re&s;olved to fall on all the Mini&s;try. They began with Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> and voted an addre&s;s to remove him from the King's Councils and pre&s;ence for ever. They went next upon the Duke of <HI>Buckingham:</HI> And, it being moved in his name, that the Hou&s;e would hear him, he was &s;uffered to come to the Hou&s;e. The fir&s;t day of his being before them he fell into &s;uch a di&s;order, that he pretended he was taken ill, and de&s;ired to be admitted again. Next day he was more compo&s;ed. He ju&s;tifi|ed his own de&s;igns, laying all the ill coun&s;els upon others, chiefly on Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> intimating plainly that the root of all errors was in the King and the Duke. He &s;aid, hunting was a good di|ver&s;ion, but if a man would hunt with a brace of lob&s;ters, he would have but ill &s;port. He had u&s;ed that figure to my&s;elf; but had then applied it to Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and Lord <HI>Arlington:</HI> But it was now un|der&s;tood to go higher. His &s;peech &s;ignified nothing towards the &s;aving of him&s;elf: But it lo&s;t him the King's favour &s;o entirely, that he never recovered it afterwards. Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> was next at|tack'd: He appeared al&s;o before the Commons, and &s;poke much
<PB N="366" REF="381">
better than was expected: He excu&s;ed him&s;elf, but without blam|ing the King: And this had &s;o good an effect, that tho' he, as Secretary of State, was more expo&s;ed than any other, by the many warrants and orders he had &s;igned, yet he was acquitted, tho' by a &s;mall majority. But the care he took to pre&s;erve him&s;elf, and his &s;ucce&s;s in it, lo&s;t him his high favour with the King, as the Duke was out of mea&s;ure offended at him: So he quitted his po&s;t, and was made Lord Chamberlain.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons was re&s;olved to force the King to a peace with the <HI>Dutch.</HI> The Court of <HI>France</HI> recalled <HI>Croi&s;&s;y,</HI> find|ing that the Duke was offended at his being led by Lord <HI>Arlington. Rouvigny</HI> was &s;ent over: A man of great practice in bu&s;ine&s;s, and in all intrigues. He was &s;till a firm Prote&s;tant, but in all other re&s;pects a very dextrous Courtier, and one of the greate&s;t States|men in <HI>Europe.</HI> He had the appointments of an Emba&s;&s;ador, but would not take the character, that he might not have a Chapel, and Ma&s;s &s;aid in it. Upon his coming over, as he him&s;elf told me, he found all the Mini&s;ters of the Allies were perpetually plying the Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons with their memorials. He knew he could gain nothing on them: So he never left the King. The King was in great perplexity: He would have done any thing, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A teace concluded with the States.</NOTE> and parted with any per&s;ons, if that would have procured him mo|ney for carrying on the war. But he &s;aw little appearance of that. He found he was indeed at the mercy of the States. So Lord <HI>Arling|ton</HI> pre&s;&s;ed the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters to prevail with the States, and the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> to get a propo&s;ition for a peace to be &s;et on foot. And that it might have &s;ome &s;hew of a peace both beg'd and bought, he propo&s;ed that a &s;um of money &s;hould be offered the King by the States, which &s;hould be made over by him to the Prince for the pay|ment of the debt he owed him. <HI>Rouvigny</HI> pre&s;s'd the King much to give his Parliament all &s;atisfaction in points of religion. The King an&s;wered him, if it was not for his brother's folly, <HI>(La Sotti&s;e de mon Frere,)</HI> he would get out of all his difficulties. <HI>Rouvingy</HI> drew a memorial for informing the Hou&s;e of Commons of the mo|de&s;ty of his ma&s;ter's preten&s;ions: For now the <HI>French</HI> King was &s;en|&s;ible of his errors in making &s;uch high demands, as he had made at <HI>Utrecht;</HI> and was endeavouring to get out of the war on ea&s;ier terms. The States committed a great error in de&s;iring a peace with <HI>England,</HI> without de&s;iring at the &s;ame time, that the King &s;hould enter into the alliance for reducing the <HI>French</HI> to the terms of the Triple Alliance. But the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> thought, that if he could once &s;eparate the King from his alliance with <HI>France,</HI> the other point would be &s;oon brought about. And the States were much &s;et on the having a peace with <HI>England,</HI> hoping then both to be
<PB N="367" REF="382">
freed of the great trouble of &s;ecuring the coa&s;t at a va&s;t charge, and al&s;o by the advantage of their fleet to ruine the trade, and to in&s;ult the coa&s;t of <HI>France.</HI> The States did this winter confer a new and extraordinary dignity on the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> They made him Hereditary Stadtholder. So that this was entailed on him, and his i&s;&s;ue male. He had in a year and a half's time changed the whole face of their affairs. He had not only taken <HI>Naerden,</HI> which made <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> ea&s;y: But by a very bold undertaking he had gone up the <HI>Rhine</HI> to <HI>Bon,</HI> and had taken it in a very few days: And in it had cut off the &s;upplies that the <HI>French</HI> &s;ent down to their gar|ri&s;ons on the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the <HI>I&s;el.</HI> So that the <HI>French</HI> finding they could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t longer there, were now re&s;olved to evacuate all tho&s;e places, and the three Provinces of which they were po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed; which they did a few months after. An alliance was al|&s;o made with the Emperor. And by this means both the Elector of <HI>Cologn,</HI> and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> were brought to a peace with the States. The Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> was likewi&s;e returning to the alliance with the States: For in the treaty, to which he was forced to &s;ubmit, with <HI>Turenne</HI> for a truce of a year, he had put an article, re&s;erving to him&s;elf a liberty to act in concurrence with the Empire, according to &s;uch re&s;olutions as &s;hould be taken in the Diet. This change of the affairs of the States had got the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> the affections of the people to &s;uch a degree, that he could have ob|tained every thing of them that he would have de&s;ired: And even the lo&s;s of &s;o important a place as <HI>Ma&s;tricht</HI> was not at all charged on him. So he brought the States to make applications to the King in the &s;tyle of tho&s;e who beg'd a peace, tho' it was vi&s;ible they could have forced it. In conclu&s;ion, a project of a peace with <HI>En|gland</HI> was formed, or rather the peace of <HI>Breda</HI> was writ over again, with the offer of 2 or 300000 <HI>l.</HI> for the expence of the war. And the King &s;igned it at Lord <HI>Arlington</HI>'s office.</P>
<P>He came up immediately into the drawing room; where &s;eeing <HI>Rouvigny</HI> he took him a&s;ide, and told him, he had been doing a thing that went more again&s;t his heart, than the lo&s;ing of his right hand: He had &s;igned a peace with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the project being brought him by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador: He &s;aw nothing could content the Hou&s;e of Commons, or draw money from them: And Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> had pre&s;&s;ed him &s;o hard, that he had &s;tood out till he was weary of his life: He &s;aw it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to carry on the war without &s;upplies, of which it was plain he could have no hopes. <HI>Rouvigny</HI> told him, what was done could not be helped: <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King became the mediator of the peace.</NOTE> But he would let him &s;ee how faithfully he would &s;erve him on this occa&s;ion: He did not doubt but his ma&s;ter would &s;ubmit all his pre|ten&s;ions to him, and make him the arbiter and mediator of the
<PB N="368" REF="383">
peace. This the King received with great joy; and &s;aid, it would be the mo&s;t acceptable &s;ervice that could be done him. The <HI>French</HI> re&s;olved upon this to accept of the King's mediation. And &s;o the King got out of the war, very little to his honour, having both en|gaged in it upon unju&s;t grounds, and managed it all along with ill conduct, and bad &s;ucce&s;s: And now he got out of it in &s;o poor and &s;o di&s;honourable a manner, that with it he lo&s;t his credit both at home and abroad. Yet he felt little of all this. He and his brother were now at their ea&s;e. Upon this, the Parliament was quickly pro|rogued: And the Court delivered it &s;elf up again to its ordinary cour&s;e of &s;loth and luxury. But Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> who had brought all this about, was &s;o entirely lo&s;t by it, that tho' he knew too much of the &s;ecret to be ill u&s;ed, yet he could never recover the ground he had lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Duche&s;s of <HI>York</HI> came over that winter. She was then very young, about &s;ixteen, but of a full growth. She was a graceful per|&s;on, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duch|e&s;s's charac|ter.</NOTE> with a good mea&s;ure of beauty, and &s;o much wit and cunning, that during all this reign &s;he behaved her &s;elf in &s;o obliging a man|ner, and &s;eemed &s;o innocent and good, that &s;he gained upon all that came near her, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them with &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions of her, that it was long before her behaviour after &s;he was a Queen could make them change their thoughts of her. So artificially did this young <HI>Italian</HI> behave her &s;elf, that &s;he deceived even the eld|e&s;t and mo&s;t jealous per&s;ons, both in the Court and Country. Only &s;ometimes a &s;atyrical temper broke out too much, which was im|puted to youth and wit not enough practi&s;ed to the world. She avoided the appearances of a zealot, or a meddler in bu&s;ine&s;s; and gave her &s;elf up to innocent cheerfulne&s;s; and was univer&s;ally e&s;teemed and beloved, as long as &s;he was Duche&s;s.</P>
<P>She had one put about her to be her Secretary, <HI>Coleman;</HI> who be|came &s;o active in the affairs of the party, and ended his life &s;o un|fortunately, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coleman</HI>'s character.</NOTE> that &s;ince I had much conver&s;ation with him, his cir|cum&s;tances may de&s;erve that his character &s;hould be given, tho' his per&s;on did not. I was told, he was a Clergyman's &s;on: But he was early catched by the Je&s;uits, and bred many years among them. He under&s;tood the art of managing controver&s;ies, chiefly that great one of the authority of the Church, better than any of their Prie&s;ts. He was a bold man, re&s;olved to rai&s;e him&s;elf, which he did by de|dicating him&s;elf wholly to the Je&s;uits: And &s;o he was rai&s;ed by them. He had a great ea&s;ine&s;s in writing in &s;everal languages; and writ ma|ny long letters, and was the chief corre&s;pondent the party had in <HI>England.</HI> He lived at a va&s;t expence. And talked in &s;o po&s;itive a manner, that it looked like one who knew he was well &s;upported. I &s;oon &s;aw into his temper; and I warned the Duke of it: For I looked on him, as a man much liker to &s;poil bu&s;ine&s;s, than to car|ry
<PB N="369" REF="384">
it on dextrou&s;ly. He got into the confidence of <HI>P. Ferrier</HI> the King of <HI>France</HI>'s confe&s;&s;or; and tried to get into the &s;ame pitch of confidence with <HI>P. de la Chai&s;e,</HI> who &s;ucceeded him in that po&s;t. He went about everywhere, even to the jayls among the criminals, to make pro&s;elytes. He dealt much both in the giving and taking of bribes. But now the affairs of <HI>England</HI> were calmed, I look again to <HI>Scotland,</HI> which was yet in a &s;torm.</P>
<P>The King writ to Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> to come up. And when he <NOTE PLACE="marg">The affairs of <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> and Lord <HI>Tweedale</HI> arrived, they were &s;o well received, that they hoped to carry their point. But the King's de&s;ign in this was, that, if he could have brought the Hou&s;e of Commons to have given mo|ney, he was re&s;olved to have parted with Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> and have employed them. And his kind u&s;age of them was on de&s;ign to per|&s;uade the Commons to u&s;e him&s;elf better, by &s;hewing that he was ready to comply with them. He gave them &s;o good a hearing, that they thought they had fully convinced him: And he blamed them only for not complaining to him&s;elf of tho&s;e grievances. But, as &s;oon as he &s;aw it was to no purpo&s;e to look for money from the Hou&s;e of Commons, and had &s;igned the peace, he &s;ent them down with full a&s;&s;urances that all things &s;hould be left to the judgment of the Parliament. They came down thro' the greate&s;t fall of &s;now that has been in all my life time. When they got home, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment was prorogued.</NOTE> in&s;tead of a &s;e&s;&s;ion, there was an order for a prorogation; which gave &s;uch an univer&s;al di&s;content, that many offered at very extra|vagant propo&s;itions, for de&s;troying Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> and all his par|ty. Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who told me this &s;ome years after, when an Act of Grace was publi&s;hed, was neither &s;o bad nor &s;o bold as to hearken to the&s;e. The King writ him a cajoling letter, de&s;iring him to come up once more, and to refer all matters to him: And he a&s;|&s;ured him, he would make up all differences.</P>
<P>In the mean while Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> took all po&s;&s;ible methods to be|come <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dalrimple</HI>'s character.</NOTE> more popular. He connived at the in&s;olence of the Pre&s;byteri|ans, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of the vacant Churches of <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> and preached in it for &s;ome months. The Earl of <HI>Argile</HI> and Sir <HI>James Dalrimple</HI> were the men on whom the Pre&s;byterians depended mo&s;t. Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> returned to his old kindne&s;s with the for|mer: And Lord <HI>Argile</HI> was very ready to forget his late unkindne&s;s. So matters were made up between them. <HI>Darlimple</HI> was the Pre&s;i|dent of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, a man of great temper, and of a very mild de|portment, but a cunning man. He was now taken into the chief con|fidence. He told the Pre&s;byterians, if they would now &s;upport Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> this would remove the prejudice the King had again&s;t them, as enemies to his &s;ervice. This wrought on many of them.</P>
<P>What influence &s;oever this might have on the Pre&s;byterians, the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Clergy was much provoked.</NOTE>
<PB N="370" REF="385">
&s;trange conduct with relation to them provoked the Clergy out of mea&s;ure. Some hot men, that were not preferred as they thought they de&s;erved, grew very mutinous, and complained that things were let fall into much confu&s;ion. And they rai&s;ed a grievous outcry for the want of a National Synod to regulate our wor&s;hip and govern|ment: And &s;o moved in the Dioce&s;an Synods, that a petition &s;hould be offered to the Privy Council, &s;etting forth the nece&s;&s;ity of hav|ing a National Synod. I liked no part of this. I knew the temper of our Clergy too well, to depend much on them. Therefore I went out of the way on purpo&s;e when our Synod was to meet. Petitions were offered for a National Synod, which was thought an innocent thing. Yet, it being done on de&s;ign to heighten the fermentation the King|dom was in, great exceptions were taken to it. One Bi&s;hop, and four of the Clergy, were turned out by an order from the King, pur&s;uant to the Act a&s;&s;erting the Supremacy. After a year, upon their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, they were re&s;tored. Tho' I was not at all concerned in this, (for I was ever of <HI>Nazianzen</HI>'s opinion, who never wi&s;hed to &s;ee any more Synods of the Clergy,) yet the King was made be|lieve, that I had laid the whole matter, even tho' I did not appear in any part of it.</P>
<P>Another di&s;order broke out, which had greater effects. A cau&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">A great di|&s;traction in <HI>S$$tland.</HI></NOTE> being judged in the &s;upreme Court of Se&s;&s;ion, the party appealed to the Parliament. This was looked on as a high contempt, done on de&s;ign to make the Parliament a Court of judicature, that &s;o there might be a nece&s;&s;ity of frequent Parliaments. So the Judges requir|ed all the lawyers to condemn this, as contrary to law. And they had the words of a law on their &s;ide: For there lay no &s;uch appeal: as &s;topt proce&s;s, nor was there a writ of error in their law: But up|on petitions, Parliaments had, tho' but &s;eldom, reviewed and re|ver&s;ed the judgments of the Courts. So the debate lay about the &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>Appeal.</HI> Sir <HI>George Lockhart,</HI> brother to the Em|ba&s;&s;ador, was the mo&s;t learned lawyer, and the be&s;t pleader I have ever yet known in any Nation; and he had all the lawyers almo&s;t in a dependance on him. He was engaged with the party, and re|&s;olved to &s;tand it out. The King &s;ent down an order to put all men from the bar, that did not condemn appeals. And, when that wrought not on them, they were by proclamation bani&s;hed <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> and $word$ $$les about it: And a new day was a&s;&s;igned them for making $word$ $span$on; the King in a very unu&s;ual &s;tyle declaring, on the $word$ a Prince, that, if they &s;ubmitted not by that day, they &s;hould $word$ $word$ $word$ admitted to their practice. They &s;tood it out: And the day $span$out their &s;ubmitting. Yet afterwards they renounced appeals in the &s;en&s;e of the <HI>Roman</HI> law: And, notwith&s;tanding the unu|&s;ual threatning in the proclamation, they were again re&s;tored to prac|tice.
<PB N="371" REF="386">
But this made a&s;top for a whole year in all legal proceedings.</P>
<P>The government of the city of <HI>Edenburgh</HI> was not &s;o com|pliant, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s proceedings there</NOTE> as was expected. So Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> procured a letter from the King to turn out twelve of the chief Magi&s;trates, and to declare them for ever incapable of all publick tru&s;ts: So entirely had he forgot his complaints formerly made again&s;t incapacity, even when pa&s;s'd in an Act of Parliament. The boroughs of <HI>Scot|land</HI> have by law a privilege of meeting once a year in a body, to con&s;ider of trade, and of by-laws relating to it. At a convention held this year a petition was agreed on, and &s;ent to the King, com|plaining of &s;ome late Acts that hindered trade, for the repeal of which there was great need of a &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament: They there|fore prayed, that when the King &s;ent down a Commi&s;&s;ioner to hold a &s;e&s;&s;ion, he might be in&s;tructed in order to that repeal. This was judged a legal thing by the lawyers there; for this was a law|ful a&s;&s;embly: They did not petition for a Parliament, but only for in&s;tructions to the &s;e&s;&s;ion. Yet it was condemned as &s;editious: And tho&s;e who promoted it were fined and impri&s;oned for it. Thus Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was lifted up out of mea&s;ure, and re&s;olved to cru&s;h all that &s;tood in his way. He was made Earl of <HI>Guilford</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and had a pen&s;ion of <HI>3000l:</HI> And he let him&s;elf loo&s;e into a very ungoverned fury. When Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and &s;ome other Lords came up, the King de&s;ired they would put their complaints in wri|ting. They &s;aid, the laws were &s;o oddly worded, and more oddly executed, in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that the mode&s;te&s;t paper they could offer might be condemned as lea&s;ing-making, and mi&s;repre&s;enting the King's proceedings: So they would not venture on it. The King promi&s;ed them, that no ill u&s;e &s;hould be made of it to their pre|judice. But they did not think it &s;afe to tru&s;t him; for he &s;eem|ed to be entirely delivered up to all Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>It is no wonder then that I could not &s;tand before him; tho' at <NOTE PLACE="marg">I was di&s;|graced.</NOTE> my coming up the Duke of <HI>York</HI> received me with great kindne&s;s, and told me, how he had got out of great difficulties, and added, that the King was very firm to him: He commended likewi&s;e his new Duche&s;s much: He was troubled at our di&s;orders: He was firm to Duke <HI>Lauderdale:</HI> But he would have endeavoured to reconcile mat|ters, if there had been room for it. He told me, the King was high|ly incen&s;ed again&s;t me; and was made believe, that I was the chie$ &s;pring of all that had happened: He him&s;elf believed me more in|nocent; and &s;aid, he would endeavour to &s;et me right with him: And he carried me to the King, who received me coldly. Some days after, when the Duke was a hunting, the Lord Chamberlain told me, he had orders to &s;trike my name out of the li&s;t of the Chaplains and that the King forbad me the Court, and expected I &s;hould go
<PB N="372" REF="387">
back to <HI>Scotland.</HI> The Duke &s;eemed troubled at this, and &s;poke to the King about it: But he was po&s;itive. Yet he admitted me to &s;ay to him what I had to offer in my own ju&s;tification. I &s;aid all that I thought nece&s;&s;ary; and appealed to Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who did me ju&s;tice in it. But the King &s;aid, he was afraid I had been too bu&s;y; and wi&s;hed me to go home to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and be more quiet. The Duke upon this told me, that, if I went home without reconciling my &s;elf to Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> I &s;hould be certainly &s;hut up in a clo&s;e pri&s;on, where I might perhaps lye too long. This I look'd on as a very high obligation: So I re&s;igned my employment, and re&s;olved to &s;tay in <HI>England.</HI> I preached in many of the Churches of <HI>London;</HI> and was &s;o well receiv'd, that it was probable I might be accepted of in any that was to be di&s;po&s;ed of by a popular election. So a Church fall|ing to be given in that way, the electors had a mind to choo&s;e me: But yet they were not willing to offend the Court. The Duke &s;poke to Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> and told him that he had a mind I &s;hould be &s;ettled in <HI>London,</HI> and de&s;ired he would not oppo&s;e it. Duke <HI>Lau|derdale</HI> &s;aid, all this was a trick of the party in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to &s;ettle me, that I might be a corre&s;pondent between the factions in both Kingdoms. Yet, upon the Duke's undertaking that I &s;hould not meddle in tho&s;e matters, he was contented that the King &s;hould let the electors know, he was not again&s;t their choo&s;ing me. Upon this Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> &s;eeing what a root I had with the Duke, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to me, that, if I would promi&s;e to keep no farther corre&s;pondence with Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> I &s;hould again be re&s;tored to his favour. I &s;aid, I had promi&s;ed the Duke to meddle no more in <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> affairs: But I could not for&s;ake my friends, nor turn again&s;t them. By this he judged I was inflexible. So he carried a &s;tory to the King the very night before the election, that upon enquiry was found to be fal&s;e, when it was too late to help what was done. Upon that, the King &s;ent a &s;evere me&s;&s;age to the electors. So I mi&s;&s;ed that. And &s;ome time after a new &s;tory was invented, of which <HI>Sharp</HI> was indeed the author, by which the King was made believe that I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing both Lords and Commons again&s;t Duke <HI>Lau|derdale.</HI> Upon that, the King ordered <HI>Coventry</HI> to command me to leave <HI>London,</HI> and not to come within twenty miles of it. The Duke told me what the particulars were, which were all fal&s;e: For Lord <HI>Faulconbridge</HI> and Lord <HI>Carli&s;le</HI> were the Lords, into whom it was &s;aid I was infu&s;ing tho&s;e prejudices. Now I was known to neither of them; for, tho' they had de&s;ired my acquaintance, I had declin|ed it. So I told all this to Secretary <HI>Coventry,</HI> who made report of it to the King in the Duke's pre&s;ence: And tho&s;e Lords ju&s;tified me in the matter. I hoped the King would upon all this recall his order. But he would not do it. So I a&s;ked to have it in writing. The Secre|tary
<PB N="373" REF="388">
knew it was again&s;t law: So he would not do it. But I was forbid the Court. The Duke brought Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> and me once toge|ther, to have made us friends. But nothing would do, unle&s;s I would for&s;ake all my friends, and di&s;cover &s;ecrets. I &s;aid, I knew no wicked ones: And I could not break with per&s;ons, with whom I had lived long in great friend&s;hip. The Duke &s;poke to the Lord Trea&s;urer, to &s;often Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> with relation to me; and &s;ent me to him. He under|took to do it; but &s;aid afterwards, Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was intractable.</P>
<P>This violent and groundle&s;s pro&s;ecution la&s;ted &s;ome months. And during that time I &s;aid to &s;ome, that Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> had gone &s;o far in opening &s;ome wicked de&s;igns to me, that I perceived he could not be &s;atisfied, unle&s;s I was undone. So I told what was mention|ed before of the di&s;cour&s;es that pa&s;s'd between him and me. This I ought not to have done, &s;ince they were the effects of confidence and friend&s;hip. But &s;uch a cour&s;e of provocation might have heat|ed a cooler and elder man than I was, being then but thirty, to forget the caution that I ought to have u&s;ed. The per&s;ons who had this from me, re&s;olved to make u&s;e of it again&s;t him, in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament: For which the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> and he were preparing, by turning to new methods.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Danby</HI> &s;et up to be the patron of the Church-party, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mini|&s;ters turned to the Church par|ty.</NOTE> of the old Cavaliers: And Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> joined him&s;elf to him. It was &s;aid, the King had all along neglected his be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t friends: So a new mea&s;ure was taken up, of doing all po&s;&s;ible honours to the memory of King <HI>Charles</HI> I, and to all that had been in his intere&s;ts. A &s;tatue of bra&s;s on hor&s;e back, that had been long neglected, was bought, and &s;et up at <HI>Charing-cro&s;s:</HI> And a magnificent funeral was de&s;igned for him. The building of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s in <HI>London</HI> was now &s;et on foot with great zeal. <HI>Morley</HI> and &s;ome of the Bi&s;hops were &s;ent for: And the new Mini&s;try &s;ettled a &s;cheme with them, by which it was offered to cru&s;h all the de&s;igns of Popery. The Mi|ni&s;ters expre&s;&s;ed a great zeal in this; and openly accu&s;ed all the for|mer Mini&s;ters for neglecting it &s;o long. But, to excu&s;e this to the Duke, they told him, it was a great misfortune, that the Church party and the Di&s;&s;enters were now run into one; that the Church party mu&s;t have &s;ome content given them; and then a te&s;t was to be &s;et on foot, that &s;hould for ever &s;hut out all Di&s;&s;enters, who were an implacable &s;ort of people. A Declaration renouncing the law|fulne&s;s of re&s;i&s;tance in any ca&s;e what&s;oever, and an engagement to endeavour no alteration in Church or State, was de&s;igned to be a nece&s;&s;ary qualification of all that might choo&s;e, or be cho&s;en Mem|bers of Parliament. If this could be carried, the King's party would be for ever &s;eparated from the Di&s;&s;enters, and be &s;o much the more united to him. In order to this, it was nece&s;&s;ary to put out &s;evere
<PB N="374" REF="389">
orders of Council again&s;t all convicted or &s;u&s;pected Papi&s;ts. The Duke acquainted me with this &s;cheme. He di&s;liked it much. He thought, this would rai&s;e the Church party too high. He looked on them as intractable in the point of Popery. Therefore he thought, it was better to keep them under by &s;upporting the Papi&s;ts. He looked on the whole project, as both knavi&s;h and fooli&s;h. And upon this he &s;poke &s;everely of Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> who he &s;aw would do any thing to &s;ave him&s;elf: He had been all along in ill terms both with <HI>Sheldon</HI> and <HI>Morley:</HI> But now he reconciled him&s;elf to them: He brought <HI>Sharp</HI> out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who went about a&s;&s;ur|ing all people, that the party &s;et again&s;t him was likewi&s;e &s;et again&s;t the Church. This, tho' notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed for true among &s;trangers. And, <HI>Leightoun</HI> coming up at the year's end to quit his Archbi&s;hoprick of <HI>Gla&s;cow, Burnet</HI> had made &s;uch &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions that he was re&s;tored to it. So that wound, which had been given to Epi&s;copacy in his per&s;on, was now healed. And <HI>Leightoun</HI> retired to a private hou&s;e in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> where he lived ten years in a mo&s;t hea|venly manner, and with a &s;hining conver&s;ation. So now Duke <HI>Lau|derdale</HI> was at the head of the Church party.</P>
<P>The Court was &s;omewhat di&s;turbed with di&s;coveries that were <NOTE PLACE="marg">Corre&s;pon|dence with <HI>Holland</HI> di&s;|covered.</NOTE> made at this time. When Sir <HI>Jo&s;eph William&s;on</HI> came back from <HI>Cologn,</HI> he &s;ecretly met with <HI>Wicquefort,</HI> who has publi&s;hed a work about Emba&s;&s;adors. He was the <HI>Dutch</HI> Secretary, that tran&s;lated the intelligence that came from <HI>England.</HI> And &s;ometimes the originals were left in his hands. <HI>William&s;on</HI> prevailed with him to deliver the&s;e to him. Mo&s;t of them were writ by the Lord <HI>Howard</HI>'s bro|ther, who upon his brother's death was afterwards Lord <HI>Howard.</HI> He was a man of wit and learning, bold and poor, who had run thro' many parties in religion. In <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s time he was rebaptiz|ed, and had preached in <HI>London.</HI> He &s;et up in oppo&s;ition to <HI>Crom|well,</HI> as a great Common-wealth's man, and did &s;ome &s;ervice in the Re&s;toration. But he was always poor, and ready to engage in any thing that was bold. He went over in the beginning of the war, and offered to &s;erve <HI>De Wit.</HI> But he told me, he found him a dry man. As &s;oon as the Prince was rai&s;ed, he waited on him, and on <HI>Fa|gel;</HI> and undertook not only to &s;end them good intelligence, but to make a great party for them. He pre&s;&s;ed the Prince to make a de&s;|cent on <HI>England,</HI> only to force the King to call a Parliament, and to be advi&s;ed by it. And he drew &s;uch a <HI>Manife&s;to,</HI> as he believed would be acceptable to the Nation. He, and one of the <HI>Du Mou|lins,</HI> that was in Lord <HI>Arlington</HI>'s office, joined together, and gave the States very good intelligence. <HI>Du Moulin,</HI> fearing that he was di&s;covered, took the alarm in time, and got beyond &s;ea. Mo&s;t of the papers that <HI>Wicquefort</HI> delivered were of <HI>Howard</HI>'s writing. So
<PB N="375" REF="390">
upon his examination in the Tower, it appeared they had his let|ters again&s;t him. And, when notice was &s;ent of this to <HI>Holland, Wic|quefort</HI> was called on to bring before them all the original letters that were tru&s;ted to him. And, upon his not doing it, he was clapt up. And the States &s;ent word to the King, that, if any per&s;on &s;uffered in <HI>En|gland</HI> on the account of the letters betray'd by him, his head &s;hould go for it. <HI>Halewyn</HI> told me, when it was put to the Judges to know what &s;ort of crime this could be made, &s;ince the papers were given up after the peace was concluded, (otherwi&s;e the betraying the &s;e|crets of the State to enemies was a manife&s;t crime,) they came to this re&s;olution, that as by the <HI>Roman</HI> law every thing was made ca|pital that was <HI>contra &s;alutem Populi Romani,</HI> &s;o the delivering up &s;uch papers was a capital crime. This threatning &s;aved <HI>Howard.</HI> But yet <HI>Wicquefort</HI> was kept very long in pri&s;on, and ruined by it. He had a &s;ort of a character from one of the Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> upon which he in&s;i&s;ted. But the States thought, that his coming in|to their &s;ervice was the throwing up of that character. Upon this <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jealou&s;ies of the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></NOTE> occa&s;ion <HI>Ca&s;lairs,</HI> mentioned in the year 1672, was &s;ent over from <HI>Holland</HI> to <HI>England.</HI> And he was &s;eized on with a paper of in&s;truc|tions, that were drawn &s;o darkly, that no wonder if they gave a jealou&s;y of &s;ome ill de&s;igns then on foot. The Prince &s;aid, when a&s;ked about it, that it was only meant for a direction for carrying on the levies of &s;ome regiments that the King had allowed the <HI>Dutch</HI> to make in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which the King did the better to ex|cu&s;e his letting &s;o many continue in the <HI>French</HI> &s;ervice. How&s;oever, mention being made of money to be paid, and of men to be rai&s;ed, and a complement being ordered to be made to Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> this looked &s;u&s;picious. <HI>Howard</HI> had confe&s;&s;ed all he knew upon pro|mi&s;e of pardon. So that and this laid together gave the Court &s;ome apprehen&s;ions. Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> made u&s;e of it to heighten the King's ill opinion of the party again&s;t him. And, becau&s;e Lieute|nant General <HI>Drummond</HI> was of all the military men he that had the be&s;t capacity, and the greate&s;t reputation, he moved that he might be &s;ecured. The method he took in doing it &s;hewed, that he neither &s;u&s;pected him, nor regarded the law. The ancient <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Drummond</HI> was ordered to pri&s;on.</NOTE> method was to require men to render them&s;elves pri&s;oners by &s;uch a day. This was a &s;nare to many, who, tho' innocent, yet hating re&s;traint went out of the way, and were proceeded again&s;t in an out|lawry: But an Act of Parliament had been made, condemning that method for the future. Yet Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> re&s;olved to follow it. And <HI>Drummond,</HI> knowing his innocence, rendred him&s;elf as requir|ed; and was kept a year in a very cold and inconvenient pri&s;on, at <HI>Dunbarton,</HI> on the top of a high rock. This, coming after a whole life of loyalty and zeal, was thought a very extraordinary reward to &s;uch high preten&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="391">
One thing on this occa&s;ion may be fit to be told. Lord <HI>Kincar|din</HI> had &s;erved Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> faithfully, even longer than he could do with a good con&s;cience: For he had &s;tuck to him, and was le$t by him with the King, when he went to <HI>Scotland,</HI> who knew well with how much zeal he had &s;upported his intere&s;t, and excu&s;ed his $aults. When Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was hotly pu&s;hed at, he then promi&s;ed to all his friends, that he would avoid all former er|rors, if $e got out of his trouble: And that made Lord <HI>Kincardin</HI> &s;o $$rne&s;t to &s;$rve him. But, when he &s;aw into how much fury he was running, he tried to have p$r&s;uaded him to more temper; but found it was in vain. Then he confe&s;&s;ed to me, that I had judged $ru$span$ th$span$ h$ had done&punc; for I believed he would grow wor&s;e than ever. When Lord <HI>Kincardin</HI> found, he could not hinder things in priva$e, he oppo$e$ them at Council: And &s;o they broke with him. He came up to ju&s;tify him&s;elf to the King, who minded tho&s;e mat|ters very little; but thought it was nece&s;&s;ary to give a full &s;cope to Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s motions, who had told the King there was a &s;p$span$it of rebellion that run thro' all &s;orts of people, and that was to be &s;ubdued by acts of power, tho' perhaps neither legal nor ju&s;t: And when that evil &s;pirit was once bro$en, then it would be fit to return to more legal and moderate coun&s;els. So Lord <HI>Kincardin</HI> found, there was no arguing with the King upon particulars. There|fore $e beg'd $ave to &s;tay &s;ome time at Court, that he might not be obliged to oppo&s;e that, which the King was made believe his &s;ervice required. The King con&s;ented to this; and upon all occa|&s;ions $&s;$d him very well. Duke <HI>Landerdale</HI> could not bear that, and pr$$$ed the King often to command him home; which he refu&s;ed to do. Once he urged it with much vehemence: And the King an|&s;wered as po&s;itively, that he &s;aw no rea&s;on for it, and he would not do it. Upon this he came home as in a $it of di&s;traction, and was gathering together all his commi&s;&s;ions to deliver them up to the King. Upon that the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Athol,</HI> who was then in high fa|vour with him, went to the King; and told him that he had &s;ent Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> home half dead, and half mad; and beg'd the King to take pity on him. So the King &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to Lord <HI>K$span$,</HI> ordering him to go home. This Lord <HI>Athol</HI> him&s;elf told me afterwards.</P>
<P>Towards the end of &s;ummer the battel of <HI>Seneff</HI> was fought: In <NOTE PLACE="marg">The $word$ <HI>o$ $word$.</HI></NOTE> the beginning of which the <HI>French</HI> had a great advantage: But the Prince of <HI>$span$de</HI> pu&s;hed it too far: And the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> enga|ged the whole army with &s;o much bravery, that it appeared that the <HI>Dutch</HI> army was now brought to another &s;tate than he had found it in. He charged him&s;elf in many places, with too great a neglect of his per&s;on, con&s;idering how much depended upon it. He once
<PB N="377" REF="392">
was engaged among a body of <HI>French,</HI> thinking they were his own men, and bid them charge: They told him, they had no more pow|der: He, perceiving they were none of his men, with great pre&s;ence of mind got out of their hands, and brought up a body of his army to charge them; who quickly routed them. The action in the after|noon recovered the lo&s;s that was made in the morning; and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed all the world, the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> in particular, with a great e&s;teem of the Prince's conduct and courage. I will &s;ay little of fo|reign affairs; becau&s;e there are many copious accounts of them in print; and I can add little to them. With relation to the battel of <HI>Seneff,</HI> the Prince him&s;elf told me that the day before he &s;aw a Ca|puchin, that came over from the <HI>French</HI> army, and had a long con|ver&s;ation with <HI>Zouch,</HI> the Emperor's General; who behaved him|&s;elf &s;o ill on the day of battel, that the Prince &s;aid to his &s;on at night, that his father had acted &s;o ba&s;ely, that, if it had not been for the re&s;pect he bore the Emperor, he would have &s;hot him thro' the head. He was di&s;graced on this. But the &s;ucce&s;s of the campaign was lo&s;t by it. They had a noble army; and might have done much more than they did. <HI>Grave</HI> was retaken in the end of the campaign. So the Provinces were now &s;afe on that &s;ide.

He offered to go over to <HI>Holland</HI> with the Earl of <HI>O&s;|&s;ory:</HI> For they fancied they had a great intere&s;t in the Prince, by their having married two of <HI>Bevervardt</HI>'s daughters: And the Prince had always a particular affection to Lord <HI>O&s;&s;ory.</HI> Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> &s;aid, he would go to the bottom of every thing with the Prince; and did not doubt, but he would bring him into an entire dependance on his uncle, and particularly di&s;po&s;e him to a general peace; on which the King was much &s;et, it being earne&s;tly de&s;ired by the <HI>French.</HI> It was likewi&s;e believed, that he had leave to give the Prince the hope of marrying her, whom he afterwards married. The Duke told me, he knew nothing of the matter: He had heard, Lord <HI>Ar|lington</HI> had talked, as if the managing that was his chief errand: And upon that he had a&s;ked the King, who a&s;&s;ured him that he had a po&s;itive order not &s;o much as to &s;peak of that matter. Yet, whe|ther notwith&s;tanding this he had a &s;ecret order, or whether he did it without order, he certainly talked a great deal of it to the Prince, as a thing which he might depend on, if he would in all other things be governed by the King.</P>

minds, chiefly the Prince's, to a peace. But the Prince had avoid|ed the &s;eeing him till the end of the campaign. Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> had thrown him off, when he went into the <HI>French</HI> intere&s;t: And <HI>Tem|ple</HI> was too proud to bear contempt, or forget &s;uch an injury &s;oon. He was a vain man, much blown up in his own conceit, which he &s;hewed too indecently on all occa&s;ions. He had a true judgment in affairs, and very good principles with relation to government; but in nothing el&s;e. He &s;eemed to think that things were as they are from all eternity: At lea&s;t he thought religion was fit only for the mob. He was a great admirer of the &s;ect of <HI>Confu&s;ius</HI> in <HI>China,</HI> who were a|thei&s;ts them&s;elves, but left religion to the rabble. He was a corrupter of all that came near him. And he delivered him&s;elf up wholly to &s;tu|dy ea&s;e and plea&s;ure. He entred into a clo&s;e friend&s;hip with Lord <HI>Danby,</HI> who depended much on him: And was directed in all his no|tions as to foreign affairs by him; for no man ever came into the Mini&s;try, that under&s;tood the affairs of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;o little as he did.</P>
<P>I will henceforth leave the account of our affairs beyond &s;ea whol|ly to <HI>Temple</HI>'s letters, in which they are very truly and fully &s;et forth. And in them it appears, that the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> even while &s;o young, and &s;o little practi&s;ed in affairs, had &s;o clear and &s;o ju&s;t a view of them, that nothing could mi&s;guide him; and that the bad pro&s;pect he had from the ill condition of affairs did not frighten him to accept of any mean or ba&s;e conditions of peace. His fideli|ty to his country, and the publick intere&s;t, was &s;o firm, that no pri|vate con&s;iderations of his own could bia&s;s him, or indeed be much con&s;idered by him. The&s;e letters give him a character that is &s;o &s;ub|lime, as well as &s;o genuine, that it rai&s;es him much above all the per|formances of rhetorick or panegyrick. I will mention very little that is to be found in them. <HI>Holland</HI> was in great expectation, when they &s;aw two &s;uch men, as the Earls of <HI>O&s;&s;ory</HI> and <HI>Arlington,</HI> come over, together with the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI>'s elde&s;t &s;on, tho' the la&s;t only made the &s;hew a little greater. Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> for &s;ome days in&s;i&s;ted vehe|mently on the Prince's di&s;mi&s;&s;ing <HI>Du Moulin,</HI> who had di&s;covered the &s;ecrets of his office to him. In this the Prince complied: And <HI>Du Mou|lin</HI> was &s;ent to one of their plantations. As to all other things, Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> talked to him in the &s;train of a governour; and &s;eemed to pre&s;ume too much on his youth, and on his want of experience. But, in&s;tead of prevailing on the Prince, he lo&s;t him &s;o entirely, that all his endeavours afterwards could never beget any confidence in him. So he came back; and reckoned this was his la&s;t e&s;&s;ay, which &s;ucceed|ing &s;o ill, he ever after that withdrew from all bu&s;ine&s;s. He made him|&s;elf ea&s;y to the King, who continued to be &s;till very kind to him.</P>
<P>At <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> a piece of private news came from <HI>France,</HI> which the <NOTE PLACE="marg">1675. Affairs in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE>
<PB N="379" REF="394">
Duke was much delighted with, becau&s;e it did an honour to the or|der of the Je&s;uits, to whom he had devoted him&s;elf. The new Con|fe&s;&s;or had &s;o pre&s;&s;ed the King of <HI>France</HI> in Lent to &s;end away his Mi&s;tri&s;s, <HI>Monte&s;pan,</HI> that he prevailed at la&s;t. She was &s;ent to a Nunnery. And &s;o the King received the Sacrament, as was &s;aid, in a &s;tate of contrition. This was writ to the Duke, and &s;et out with &s;uch circum&s;tances, as the <HI>French</HI> u&s;ually do every thing that relates to their King. The Duke was much plea&s;ed with it. He told me, he had related it with all its circum&s;tances to the King in the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI>'s hearing; and &s;aid, they both heard it with great unea&s;ine&s;s, and were much out of countenance at it. The Duke him&s;elf was then in the be&s;t temper I had ever known him in. He was reading <HI>Nurembergius</HI> of the difference of things temporal and things eternal: And we had much good di&s;cour&s;e on that &s;ubject. Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> ran &s;o much in his mind, that he once &s;aid to me, if Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> would read that book, he would not meddle in &s;o many affairs as he did. I &s;aw he was very jealous of him, and of his intere&s;t in the King. Thus I have given a full account of my acquaintance with the Duke.</P>
<P>I lo&s;t his favour &s;oon after this. For in <HI>April</HI> 1675 a &s;e&s;&s;ion of Par|liament <NOTE PLACE="marg">I was exami|ned by the Hou&s;e of Commons.</NOTE> was held, as preparatory to one that was de&s;igned next win|ter, in which money was to be a&s;ked: But none was now a&s;ked; it being only called to heal all breaches, and to beget a good under|&s;tanding between the King and his people. The Hou&s;e of Com|mons fell upon Duke <HI>Lauderdale.</HI> And tho&s;e who knew what had pa&s;s'd between him and me, moved that I &s;hould be examined be|fore a Committee. I was brought before them. I told them how I had been commanded out of town. But tho' that was illegal, yet, &s;ince it had been let fall, it was not in&s;i&s;ted on. I was next examin|ed concerning his de&s;ign of arming the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Papi&s;ts. I &s;aid, I, as well as others, had heard him &s;ay, he wi&s;hed the Pre&s;byterians in <HI>Scot|land</HI> would rebel, that he might bring over the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Papi&s;ts to cut their throats. I was next examined concerning the de&s;ign of bring|ing a <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> army into <HI>England.</HI> I de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed, as to what had pa&s;&s;ed in private di&s;cour&s;e; to which I thought I was not bound to an&s;wer, unle&s;s it were high trea&s;on. They pre&s;&s;ed me long: And I would give them no other an&s;wer. So they all concluded, that I knew great matters; and reported this &s;pecially to the Hou&s;e. Upon that I was &s;ent for, and brought before the Hou&s;e. I &s;tood upon it as I had done at the Committee, that I was not bound to an&s;wer; that nothing had pa&s;&s;ed that was high trea&s;on; and as to all other things, I did not think my &s;elf bound to di&s;cover them. I &s;aid far|ther, I knew Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was apt to &s;ay things in a heat, which he did not intend to do. And, &s;ince he had u&s;ed my &s;elf &s;o ill, I thought
<PB N="380" REF="395">
my &s;elf the more obliged not to &s;ay any thing that looked like re|venge for what I had met with from him. I was brought four times to the bar. At la&s;t I was told, the Hou&s;e thought they had a right to examine into every thing that concerned the &s;afety of the Nation, as well as into matters of trea&s;on: And they looked on me as bound to &s;atisfy them: Otherwi&s;e they would make me feel the weight of their heavy di&s;plea&s;ure, as one that concealed what they thought was nece&s;&s;ary to be known. Upon this I yielded, and gave an ac|count of the di&s;cour&s;e formerly mentioned. They laid great weight on this, and renewed their addre&s;s again&s;t Duke <HI>Lauderdale.</HI></P>
<P>I was much blamed for what I had done. Some, to make it look the wor&s;e, added, that I had been his Chaplain, which was fal&s;e; and that I had been much obliged to him, tho' I had never receiv|ed any real obligation from him, but had done him great &s;ervices, for which I had been very unworthily requited. Yet the thing had an ill appearance, as the di&s;clo&s;ing of what had pa&s;s'd in confidence; tho' I make it a great que&s;tion, how far even that ought to bind a man, when the de&s;igns are very wicked, and the per&s;on continued &s;till in the &s;ame po&s;t, and capacity of executing them. I have told the matter as it was, and mu&s;t leave my &s;elf to the cen&s;ure of the reader. My love to my country, and my private friend&s;hips carried me perhaps too far; e&s;pecially &s;ince I had declared much again&s;t Clergymen's meddling in &s;ecular affairs, and yet had run my &s;elf &s;o deep in them.</P>
<P>This broke me quite with the Court, and in that re&s;pect proved a great ble&s;&s;ing to me. It brought me out of many temptations; the greate&s;t of all being the kindne&s;s that was growing upon me from the Duke, which might have involved me into great difficulties, as it did expo&s;e me to much cen&s;ure; all which went off upon this occa&s;ion. And I applied my &s;elf to my &s;tudies, and my function, being then &s;ettled preacher at the Rolls, and &s;oon after Lecturer of St. <HI>Clements.</HI> I lived many years under the protection of St. <HI>Harbot|tle Grim&s;tone,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Rolls, who continued &s;teady in his fa|vour to me, tho' the King &s;ent Secretary <HI>William&s;on</HI> to de&s;ire him to di&s;mi&s;s me. He &s;aid, he was an old man, fitting him&s;elf for ano|ther world, and he found my mini&s;try u&s;eful to him; &s;o he prayed that he might be excu&s;ed in that. He was a long, and very kind patron to me. I continued ten years in that po&s;t, free from all ne|ce&s;&s;ities: And, I thank God, that was all I de&s;ired. But, &s;ince I was &s;o long happy in &s;o quiet a retreat, it &s;eems but a ju&s;t piece of gra|titude, that I &s;hould give &s;ome account of that venerable old man.</P>
<P>He was de&s;cended from a long-lived family; for his great grand|father <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>Harbottle Grim&s;tone</HI>'s character.</NOTE> lived till he was ninety eight, his grand-father to eighty &s;ix, and his father to &s;eventy eight, and him&s;elf to eighty two. He had
<PB N="381" REF="396">
to the la&s;t a great &s;oundne&s;s of health, of memory, and of judgment. He was bred to the &s;tudy of the law, being a younger brother. Upon his elder brother's death he threw it up. But falling in love with Judge <HI>Crook</HI>'s daughter, the father would not be&s;tow her on him, unle&s;s he would return to his &s;tudies; which he did with great &s;ucce&s;s. That Judge was one of tho&s;e who delivered his judgment in the Exchequer|chamber again&s;t the &s;hip money, which he did with a long and learn|ed argument. And Sir <HI>Harbottle</HI>'s father, who &s;erved in Parliament for <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> lay long in pri&s;on, becau&s;e he would not pay the loan-mo|ney. Thus both his family, and his wife's, were zealous for the inter|e&s;t of their country. In the beginning of the long Parliament he was a great a&s;&s;erter of the laws; and inveigh'd &s;everely again&s;t all that had been concerned in the former illegal oppre&s;&s;ion. His principle was, that allegiance and protection were mutual obligations; and that the one went for the other. He thought the law was the mea|&s;ure of both; and that when a legal protection was denied to one that paid a legal allegiance, the &s;ubject had a right to defend him|&s;elf. He was much troubled, when preachers a&s;&s;erted a divine right of regal government. He thought it had no other effect, but to give an ill impre&s;&s;ion of them as a&s;piring men: No body was convinced by it: It inclined their hearers rather to &s;u&s;pect all they &s;aid be&s;ides: It looked like the &s;acrificing their country to their own preferment; and an encouraging of Princes to turn tyrants. Yet when the long Parliament engaged into the league with <HI>Scotland,</HI> he would not &s;wear the Covenant. And he di&s;continued &s;itting in the Hou&s;e till it was laid a&s;ide. Then he came back, and joined with <HI>Hollis,</HI> and the other Pre&s;byterians, in a high oppo&s;ition to the Independents, and to <HI>Cromwell</HI> in particular, as was told in the fir&s;t book. And he was one of the &s;ecluded Members, that were forced out of the Hou&s;e. He followed afterwards the practice of the law, but was always look|ed at as one who wi&s;hed well to the ancient government of <HI>England.</HI> So he was cho&s;en Speaker of that Hou&s;e that called home the King; and had &s;o great a merit in that whole affair, that he was &s;oon af|ter, without any application of his own, made Ma&s;ter of the Rolls: In which po&s;t he continued to his death with a high reputation, as he well de&s;erved it. For he was a ju&s;t Judge; very &s;low, and ready to hear every thing that was offered, without pa&s;&s;ion or partiality. I thought his only fault was, that he was too rich: And yet he gave yearly great &s;ums in charity, di&s;charging many pri&s;oners by paying their debts. He was a very pious and devout man, and &s;pent every day at lea&s;t an hour in the morning, and as much at night, in prayer and meditation. And even in winter, when he was obliged to be ve|ry early on the bench, he took care to ri&s;e &s;o &s;oon, that he had always the command of that time, which he gave to tho&s;e exerci&s;es. He was much &s;harpened again&s;t Popery; but had always a tender|ne&s;s
<PB N="382" REF="397">
to the Di&s;&s;enters, tho' he him&s;elf continued &s;till in the com|munion of the Church. His &s;econd wife, whom I knew, was niece to the great Sir <HI>Francis Bacon:</HI> And was the la&s;t heir of that family. She had all the high notions for the Church and the Crown, in which &s;he had been bred; but was the humble&s;t, the devoute&s;t, and be&s;t tempered per&s;on I ever knew of that &s;ort. It was really a plea|&s;ure to hear her talk of religion: She did it with &s;o much elevation and force. She was always very plain in her clothes: And went oft to jayls, to con&s;ider the wants of the pri&s;oners, and relieve, or di&s;|charge them; and by the meanne&s;s of her dre&s;s &s;he pa&s;s'd but for a &s;ervant tru&s;ted with the charities of others. When &s;he was travelling in the country, as &s;he drew near a village, &s;he often ordered her coach to &s;tay behind till &s;he had walked about it, giving orders for the in&s;truction of the children, and leaving liberally for that end. With two &s;uch per&s;ons I &s;pent &s;everal of my years very happily. But I now return to the &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament.</P>
<P>In the Hou&s;e of Commons the bu&s;ine&s;s again&s;t Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Danby</HI> at|tack'd, but in vain.</NOTE> was taken up warmly at three &s;everal times: And three &s;everal ad|dre&s;&s;es were made to the King again&s;t him. The King's an&s;wer was, that he would protect no man again&s;t law and ju&s;tice; but would condemn none without &s;pecial matter well made out. There was no money offered: So addre&s;&s;es were feeble things. The next attempt was again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Danby,</HI> who had begun to invert the u&s;ual methods of the Exchequer. But the majority were for him: So that charge came to nothing. Only tho&s;e who begun it formed a party again&s;t him, that grew in conclu&s;ion to be too hard for him. He took a different method from tho&s;e who were in the Mini&s;try before him. They had taken off the great and leading men: And left the herd as a de&s;pi&s;ed company, who could do nothing, be|cau&s;e they had none to head them. But Lord <HI>Danby</HI> reckoned that the major number was the &s;urer game: So he neglected the great men, who he thought rai&s;ed their price too high; and reck|oned, that he could gain ten ordinary men, cheaper than one of tho&s;e. This might have &s;ucceeded with him, if they that did lead his party had been wi&s;e and &s;kilful men. But he &s;eemed to be jealous of all &s;uch, as if they might gain too much credit with the King. The chief men that he made u&s;e of were of &s;o low a &s;ize, that they were baffled in every debate. So that many, who were inclin|ed enough to vote in all obedience, yet were a&s;hamed to be in the vote on the &s;ide that was manife&s;tly run down in the debate.</P>
<P>The able&s;t man of his party was <HI>Seimour,</HI> who was the fir&s;t Speak|er of the Hou&s;e of Commons that was not bred to the law. He was <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Seimour</HI>'s character.</NOTE> a man of great birth, being the elder branch of the <HI>Seimour</HI> fami|ly; and was a graceful man, bold and quick. But he had a &s;ort of a pride &s;o peculiar to him&s;elf, that I never &s;aw any thing like it.
<PB N="383" REF="398">
He had neither &s;hame nor decency with it. He was violent again&s;t the Court, till he forced him&s;elf into good po&s;ts. He was the mo&s;t a&s;&s;uming Speaker that ever &s;ate in the chair. He knew the Hou&s;e, and every man in it &s;o well, that by looking about he could tell the fate of any que&s;tion. So, if any thing was put, when the Court party was not well gathered together, he would have held the Hou&s;e from doing any thing, by a wilful mi&s;taking or mi&s;tating the que&s;tion. By that he gave time to tho&s;e, who were appointed for that mercenary work, to go about and gather in all their party. And he would di&s;cern when they had got the majority. And then he would very fairly &s;tate the que&s;tion, when he &s;aw he was &s;ure to carry it.</P>
<P>A great many of the Court grew to be &s;o unea&s;y, e&s;pecially when they &s;aw the King was under the influence of <HI>French</HI> and Popi&s;h coun&s;els, that they were glad to be out of the way at critical times. On &s;ome occa&s;ions they would venture to vote again&s;t the Court: Of which the memorable an&s;wer of <HI>Harvey</HI>'s, who was Trea&s;urer to the Queen, was a noted in&s;tance. He was one whom the King lov|ed per&s;onally: And yet upon a great occa&s;ion he voted again&s;t that which the King de&s;ired. So the King chid him &s;everely for it. Next day, another important que&s;tion falling in, he voted as the King would have him. So the King took notice of it at night; and &s;aid, you were not again&s;t me to day. He an&s;wered, no, Sir, I was again&s;t my con&s;cience to day. This was &s;o gravely delivered, that the King &s;eemed plea&s;ed with it: And it was much talked of. While things went thus in the Hou&s;e of Commons, there was the greate&s;t and longe&s;t debate in the Hou&s;e of Lords, that has been in all my time. They &s;ate upon it often till midnight.</P>
<P>It was about the te&s;t that Lord <HI>Danby</HI> had contrived, as was for|merly <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates concerning a te&s;t.</NOTE> mentioned. Lord <HI>Danby,</HI> and Lord <HI>Finch,</HI> and &s;ome of the Bi&s;hops, were the chief arguers for it. They &s;aid, it was nece&s;&s;ary that a method &s;hould be found out, to di&s;criminate the good &s;ubjects from the bad: We had been lately involved in a long civil war, occa&s;ioned by the ill principles that &s;ome had taken up with relation to government: It was fit to prevent the return of &s;uch mi&s;eries: The King had granted a very full indemnity, and had ob&s;erved it religiou&s;ly: But there was no rea&s;on, while &s;o much of the old lea|ven &s;till remained, to leave the Nation expo&s;ed to men of &s;uch prin|ciples: It was not fit to make a Parliament perpetual: Yet that was a le&s;s evil, than to run the hazard of a bad election; e&s;pecially when jealou&s;ies and fears had been blowed about the Nation: A good con&s;titution was to be pre&s;erved by all prudent methods: No man was to be pre&s;&s;ed to take this te&s;t: But, as they, who were not willing to come into &s;uch an engagement, ought to have the mode&s;ty to be contented with the favour and connivance of the Go|vernment, &s;o, if that did not teach them good manners, it might be
<PB N="384" REF="399">
fit to u&s;e &s;everer tools: To all this great oppo&s;ition was made. It was plain, the Duke did not like it: But the King was &s;o &s;et on it, that he did not declare him&s;elf again&s;t it. But all the Papi&s;ts were again&s;t it: They thought the bringing any te&s;t in practice, would certainly bring on one that would turn them out of the Hou&s;e. The Lords <HI>Shaftsbury, Buckingham, Hollis, Hallifax,</HI> and all tho&s;e who were thought the Country party, oppo&s;ed this extremely. They thought, there ought to be no te&s;ts, beyond the oath of allegiance, upon the elections to Parliament: That it being the great privi|lege of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men, that they were not to be taxed but by their repre&s;entatives; it was therefore thought a di&s;inheriting men of the main part of their birthright, to do any thing that &s;hould &s;hut them out from their votes in electing: All te&s;ts in publick a&s;&s;emblies were thought dangerous, and contrary to publick liberty: For if a Par|liament thought any law inconvenient for the good of the whole, they mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;till free to alter it: And no previous limi|tation could bind up their legi&s;lature: A great deal was &s;aid, to &s;hew that the peace of the world was be&s;t &s;ecured by good laws, and good government; and that oaths or te&s;ts were no &s;ecurity: The &s;crupulous might be fettered by them: Yet the bulk of the world would boldly take any te&s;t, and as boldly break thro' it; of which the late times had given large proofs: The matter of this te&s;t was very doubtful: For, tho' generally &s;peaking the King's per&s;on and his power were not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, yet that was not univer&s;ally true: An infant King, or a lunatick, were exceptions: As al&s;o a King in his enemies hands; which was the ca&s;e of <HI>Henry</HI> VI, for who&s;e power his own party fought even again&s;t his per&s;on: So an exception was to be under&s;tood; otherwi&s;e the propo&s;ition, that affirmed it was a trai|terous po&s;ition to &s;eparate them, was not true: Nor could it be rea|&s;onable to bind up men again&s;t alterations: Every new law was an al|teration: It was not ea&s;y to define how far the power of making al|terations might go, and where it mu&s;t &s;top: The&s;e things were be&s;t left at large: Upon the whole matter, as they were again&s;t any Parliamentary te&s;ts, &s;o they were more particularly again&s;t this. Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf more in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, than ever he had done before. He &s;poke once a whole hour, to &s;hew the inconvenience of Condemning all re&s;i&s;tance upon any pretence what&s;oever. He &s;aid, it might be proper to lay &s;uch ties upon tho&s;e who &s;erved in the militia, and in Corporations, becau&s;e there was &s;till a &s;uperior power in Paliament to declare the extent of the oath: But it might be of very ill con&s;equence to lay it on a Parliament: Since there might be ca&s;es, tho' &s;o far out of view that it was hard to &s;uppo&s;e them, in which he believed no man would &s;ay, it was not lawful to re&s;i&s;t. If a King would make us a Province, and tributa|ry to <HI>France,</HI> and &s;ubdue the Nation by a <HI>French</HI> army, or to the
<PB N="385" REF="400">
Papal authority, mu&s;t we be bound in that ca&s;e tamely to &s;ubmit? Upon which he &s;aid many things, that did cut to the quick. And yet, tho' his words were watched, &s;o that it was re&s;olved to have &s;ent him to the Tower if any one word had fallen from him that had made him liable to &s;uch a cen&s;ure, he &s;poke both with &s;o much bold|ne&s;s and &s;o much caution, that tho' he provoked the Court extream|ly no advantage could be taken again&s;t him. The Court carried eve|ry que&s;tion in favour of the te&s;t, tho' with great oppo&s;ition, and a prote&s;tation made upon every &s;tep that was carried. So that the bill was in a fair way to have pa&s;s'd: And very probably it would have pa&s;s'd in the Hou&s;e of Commons, when by an unlooked for emer|gent the &s;e&s;&s;ion was broke.</P>
<P>Ever &s;ince the end of King <HI>James</HI> I's. reign petitions of appeal <NOTE PLACE="marg">A di&s;pute about ap|peals and privileges.</NOTE> were brought to the Hou&s;e of Lords from decrees in Chancery. This ro&s;e from a parity of rea&s;on, becau&s;e writs of error lay from the Courts of law to the Hou&s;e of Lords. And &s;ince the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Chancery grew to be &s;o extended and comprehen&s;ive, it was not thought &s;afe to leave it to the Lord Chancellor's con&s;cience. So this practice, tho' &s;o lately begun, grew on by degrees to be the main bu|&s;ine&s;s of the Hou&s;e of Lords. A petition of appeal was brought again&s;t a Member of the Hou&s;e of Commons. The Lords received it, and made an order upon it. The Member being &s;erved with it, brought it into the Hou&s;e of Commons. And they voted it a breach of privilege, for the Lords to meddle with one of their Hou&s;e. The Lords on the other hand &s;aid, they were bound to do ju&s;tice to all: And no privilege could lye again&s;t that: And, &s;ince they never &s;ate but when the Commons &s;ate likewi&s;e, if a privilege from that Hou&s;e could &s;top their proceedings, there mu&s;t be a failure in ju&s;tice: And &s;ince no privilege was ever pretended in the ca&s;e of a writ of error, it could not lye again&s;t an appeal. So they re&s;olved to proceed in the cau&s;e. The Commons pa&s;s'd a vote again&s;t any lawyers that &s;hould plead at the Lords bar in this cau&s;e. But the Lords commanded the Council to go on; with which they compli|ed. And as they went from the Lords bar, they were by an order from the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;ent to the Tower. But they were by another order from the Lords &s;et at liberty. So the two Hou&s;es be|ing as it were at war, it was nece&s;&s;ary to put an end to the &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This was very unea&s;y to the Court: For they &s;aw it was a very &s;ure <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;e&s;&s;ion broke up on it.</NOTE> method to break a &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, every time that it was tak|en up. I am not &s;ure, if this was laid, or if it happened by accident. Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> &s;aid, it was laid by him&s;elf. But others a&s;&s;ured me, it happened in cour&s;e, tho' it produced great effects: For there never was a &s;trength in the Court to rai&s;e this debate of the te&s;t in any &s;ub&s;equent &s;e&s;&s;ion. And as this made the Court apprehend, they might by the pro&s;ecution of the &s;ame appeal loo&s;e the next &s;e&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="386" REF="401">
&s;ince the prorogation did only di&s;continue Parliamentary pro|ceedings, but not Judiciary ones; &s;o they feared this might go &s;o far as to force a di&s;&s;olution of the pre&s;ent Parliament: To which the Court would be very hardly brought, after they had practi&s;ed &s;o long upon the Members, and knew them all &s;o well.</P>
<P>In this &s;e&s;&s;ion, on a day that grievances were to be gone upon, <HI>Grim&s;tone</HI> &s;aid, that con&s;idering the extent of privilege, he looked on a &s;tanding Parliament as the greate&s;t grievance of the Nation; &s;o many men being exempted from ju&s;tice, and from the demands of their creditors, for &s;o long, and &s;o indefinite a time. This mo|tion was let fall at that time. But it was not forgot. And it was likely to be taken up, when new opportunities &s;hould be offered. The &s;um|mer went over without any con&s;iderable accidents at home.</P>
<P>A new &s;e&s;&s;ion met next winter. And at the fir&s;t opening it the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament.</NOTE> King laid before the Commons the great difficulties he was in by the anticipations of his revenues. It was then generally thought, that the King was in &s;uch &s;traits, that, if money could not be obtain|ed, he mu&s;t turn to other coun&s;els, and to other Mini&s;ters. The debate went high in the Committee of the whole Hou&s;e. It was offered on the one &s;ide to &s;hew, that the King had not enough in his hands to maintain the government, and to &s;ecure the Nation: Tho' our neutrality at that time made trade flow in upon us, &s;o that the Cu&s;toms ro&s;e higher than ever. On the other hand it was &s;aid, that if anticipations were once admitted as a rea&s;on for a &s;upply, the Court would never want that rea&s;on. It was fitter to examine by who&s;e means, or on what de&s;ign tho&s;e anticipations were made. At la&s;t the que&s;tion was put. And, the vote being then &s;tated, and the previous que&s;tion being then put, whether the main que&s;tion &s;hould be then put, or not, the votes were equal. So Sir <HI>Charles Harbord,</HI> who was in the chair, gave it for putting the main que&s;tion. But, &s;ome of the Country &s;ide coming in between the two que&s;tions, the main que&s;tion was lo&s;t by two or three. So near was the Court to the carrying &s;o great a point. <HI>Harbord</HI> was much blamed for his ra&s;hne&s;s. He &s;aid, the duty of the chair was always to &s;et matters forward: And &s;o he ought to have given it for putting the main que|&s;tion: And, if the &s;ame equality had continued, he &s;aid, he would have given it for the Court. He was a very rich and covetous man, who knew <HI>England</HI> well: And his parts were very quick about him in that great age, being pa&s;t eighty. A lively repartee was made by his own &s;on to him in the debate. He had &s;aid, the right way of dealing with the King, and of gaining him to them, was, to lay their hands on their pur&s;es, and to deal roundly with him. So his &s;on &s;aid, he &s;econded his motion: But he meant, that they &s;hould lay their hands on their pur&s;es, as he him&s;elf did, and hold them well &s;hut, that no money &s;hould go out of them. The Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> was
<PB N="387" REF="402">
much di&s;appointed at this. Yet he took heart, &s;ince it was brought &s;o near, that he reckoned he would make the next &s;e&s;&s;ion &s;ure. The petition of appeal, that had broke the former &s;e&s;&s;ion, was now brought on again before the Lords. The Court tried their whole &s;trength to keep it off, till they &s;aw what might be expected from the Commons. So, upon the mi&s;carriage of the great vote in the Hou&s;e of Commons, the Lords went on upon the petition: And, the Commons oppo&s;ing them vigorou&s;ly, as before, it was vi&s;ible that the Parliament mu&s;t be prorogued.</P>
<P>Upon this it was propo&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Lords to addre&s;s the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The charac|ters of &s;ome Parliament men.</NOTE> King for di&s;&s;olving the pre&s;ent Parliament. It was manife&s;t the two Hou&s;es could no longer maintain the corre&s;pondence that was ne|ce&s;&s;ary. In a new Parliament this mu&s;t fall to the ground: But it could not while this la&s;ted. It was &s;aid, a &s;tanding Parliament chang|ed the con&s;titution of <HI>England.</HI> The King did no more con&s;ult with his people, nor know them: But he had now a cabal of &s;ingle per&s;ons to deal with. The people were now cut off from their liber|ty of electing; and &s;o had no more a true repre&s;entative. It was &s;aid, that a Parliament of a long continuance would be either an engine to &s;ell the liberties of their country, or would by rendring them&s;elves popular join with the people again&s;t the Crown. In either ca&s;e it was like to be de&s;tructive to the con&s;titution. So it was moved, that an addre&s;s &s;hould be made to the King for di&s;&s;olving the Parliament. And, to the wonder of all men, the Duke joined in it. The majority of the temporal Lords were for it. But the bench of Bi&s;hops was again&s;t it: And &s;o it was not carried. The thing became the univer&s;al &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e. It was infu&s;ed into the Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, that, if they would not be more tractable, and help the King out of his nece&s;&s;ities, he was &s;ure a new Parlia|ment would give him money, and make him ea&s;y; and that the ra|ther for having di&s;&s;olved them. This wrought on many of them, who had been cho&s;en while the Nation was in a fit, or rather a fury of loyalty. They knew, they could never hope to be cho&s;en again. Many of them were ruined in their fortunes, and lived upon their privileges, and upon their pen&s;ions. They had got it among them for a maxim, which contributed not a little to our pre&s;ervation while we were in &s;uch hands, that, as they mu&s;t not give the King too much at a time, lea&s;t there &s;hould be no more u&s;e of them, &s;o they were to take care not to &s;tarve the Court, lea&s;t they them&s;elves &s;hould be &s;tarved by that means. They were indeed ge|nerally both again&s;t Popery and <HI>France.</HI> And, to redeem their cre|dit for the money that they were ready to give &s;omewhat too la|vi&s;hly, they &s;aid, when they went into their countries, that it was on de&s;ign to fix the King to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> intere&s;t, and the Prote|&s;tant religion. And they had talked &s;o high on tho&s;e heads, that
<PB N="388" REF="403">
the Court it &s;elf could not manage them, when any thing relating to the&s;e came before them. Some of them were high for the pre|rogative: Others high for the Church: And all the mercenary men were careful of them&s;elves. In oppo&s;ition to the&s;e a great party was formed, who declared more heartily for the Prote&s;tant religi|on, and for the intere&s;t of <HI>England.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Sha&s;tsbury,</HI> opened many of their eyes, and let them know the de&s;igns of the Court. And indeed they were then &s;o vi&s;ible, that there was enough &s;een, without &s;uch &s;ecret intelligence, to con|vince the mo&s;t incredulous. Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> had the greate&s;t credit of any man in the Hou&s;e. He never meddled per&s;onally with any Mini&s;ter. He had a perfect under&s;tanding of affairs. So he laid open the errors of the government with the more authority, be|cau&s;e he mixed no pa&s;&s;ion nor private re&s;entments with it. His bro|ther u&s;ually an&s;wered him with much life in a repartee, but not with the weight and force with which he &s;poke. Colonel <HI>Birch</HI> was a man of a peculiar character. He had been a carrier at fir&s;t, and re|tained &s;till, even to an affectation, the clowni&s;hne&s;s of his education. He got up in the progre&s;s of the war to be a Colonel, and to be con|cerned in the Exci&s;e. And at the Re&s;toration he was found to be &s;o u&s;eful in managing the Exci&s;e, that he was put in a good po&s;t. He was the roughe&s;t and bolde&s;t &s;peaker in the Hou&s;e; and talked in the language and phra&s;es of a carrier, but with a beauty and elo|quence that was always acceptable. I heard <HI>Coventry</HI> &s;ay, he was the be&s;t &s;peaker to carry a popular a&s;&s;embly before him that he had ever known. He &s;poke always with much life and heat. But judgment was not his talent. <HI>Waller</HI> was the delight of the Hou&s;e: And even at eighty he &s;aid the livelie&s;t things of any among them: He was only concerned to &s;ay that which &s;hould make him be ap|plauded. But he never laid the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Hou&s;e to heart, being a vain and empty, tho' a witty, man. He de&s;erves the character of being one of the great refiners of our language and poetry. He was for near &s;ixty years one of the be&s;t of all our writers that way. The two men of quality that were the mo&s;t con&s;idered were, the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;ell,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Cavendi&s;h.</HI> Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;ell</HI> was a man of great candor, and of a general reputation; univer&s;ally beloved, and tru&s;ted; of a generous and obliging temper. He had given &s;uch proofs of an undaunted courage, and of an un&s;haken firmne&s;s, that I never knew any man have &s;o entire a credit in the Nation as he had. He quickly got out of &s;ome of the di&s;orders into which the Court had drawn him. And ever after that his life was unblemi&s;h'd in all re&s;pects. He had from his fir&s;t education an inclination to fa|vour the Non-conformi&s;ts; and wi&s;hed the laws could have been made ea&s;ier to them, or they more pliant to the law. He was a &s;low man, and of little di&s;cour&s;e: But he had a true judgment, when he
<PB N="389" REF="404">
con&s;idered things at his own lei&s;ure. His under&s;tanding was not defective: But his vertues were &s;o eminent, that they would have more than balanced real defects, if any had been found in the other. Lord <HI>Cavendi&s;h,</HI> afterwards Earl, and then Duke, of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> was too much a libertine both in principle and practice. He went off from the Court at fir&s;t upon re&s;entments for &s;ome di&s;appoint|ments there. He was ambitious, and had the courage of a hero, with an unu&s;ual proportion both of wit and knowledge. He had a great &s;oftne&s;s in his exteriour deportment. <HI>Littleton</HI> and <HI>Powle</HI> were the men that laid the matters of the Hou&s;e with the greate&s;t dex|terity and care. <HI>Powle</HI> was very learned in precedents, and Parlia|ment journals, which goes a great way in their debates: And, when he had time to prepare him&s;elf, he was a clear and &s;trong &s;peaker. <HI>Littleton</HI> was the able&s;t and the vehemente&s;t arguer of them all. He commonly lay quiet till the end of a debate: And he often ended it, &s;peaking with a &s;train of conviction and authority, that was not ea&s;ily re&s;i&s;ted. I lived the very next door to him for &s;everal years: And we &s;pent a great deal of our time every day together. He told me all their management: And commonly, when he was to put his whole &s;trength to argue any point, he u&s;ed to talk it over with me, and to &s;et me to object all that I could again&s;t him. He lived wholly in <HI>London.</HI> So matters were mo&s;t in his hands during the intervals of Parliament. And by his means it was, that I arrived at &s;uch know|ledge of their intrigues. He was a wi&s;e and worthy man, had &s;tu|died much modern hi&s;tory, and the pre&s;ent &s;tate and intere&s;t of <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Lee</HI> was a man that valued him&s;elf upon artifice and cunning, in which he was a great ma&s;ter, without being out of countenance when it was di&s;covered. <HI>Vaughan,</HI> the chief Ju&s;tice's &s;on, was a man of great integrity, had much pride, but did great &s;ervice. The&s;e were the chief men that pre&s;erved the Nation from a very deceitful and practi&s;ing Court, and from a corrupt Hou&s;e of Commons. And by their &s;kill and firmne&s;s they, from a &s;mall num|ber who began the oppo&s;ition, grew at la&s;t to be the majority.</P>
<P>All this I thought fit to lay together, and to fill as it were an emp|ty <NOTE PLACE="marg">1676. A long in|terval be|tween the &s;e&s;&s;ions of Parliament.</NOTE> place in my hi&s;tory: For, as our main bu&s;ine&s;s lay in preparing for, or managing a &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, &s;o we had now a long interval, of above a year, between this &s;e&s;&s;ion in winter 1675, and the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, which was not till the &s;pring in 1677. The <HI>French</HI> were much &s;et on procuring a peace. And they, &s;eeing how much the Parliament was &s;et on engaging the King in the Alliance, prevailed with him to di&s;continue the &s;e&s;&s;ion; for which no doubt he had round &s;ums of money &s;ent to him. <NOTE PLACE="marg">An account of &s;ome pa&s;|&s;ages of <HI>Lockhart</HI>'s courage in <HI>France</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>About this time <HI>Lockhart</HI> the Emba&s;&s;ador in <HI>France</HI> died. The farther he &s;aw into the de&s;igns of the Court, he grew the more un|ea&s;y
<PB N="390" REF="405">
in the po&s;t he was in, tho' he acted in it with great &s;pirit and re&s;olution, both with relation to his own ma&s;ter, and to the <HI>French</HI> King: Of which I will &s;et down two pa&s;&s;ages, that may be very in|&s;tructive to Emba&s;&s;adors. In this time of neutrality the <HI>French</HI> pri|vateers took many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hips, pretending they were <HI>Dutch</HI> only with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pa&s;&s;es. One of the&s;e was taken by a privateer, that, as was believed, <HI>Pepys,</HI> then &s;ecretary to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Admiralty, and in great favour with the Duke, had built; and, as was &s;aid, out of the King's &s;tores. The merchants proved in Council, that the &s;hip was <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> So <HI>Lockhart</HI> had an order to demand her: And he pre&s;|&s;ed it &s;o effectually, that an order was &s;ent from the Court of <HI>France</HI> to di&s;charge her. But, before that was executed, the King was pre|vailed on by <HI>Pepys,</HI> to tell the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador, that he did not concern him&s;elf in that &s;hip: He believed merchants were rogues, and could bring witne&s;&s;es to prove what&s;oever they had a mind to: So the Court of <HI>France</HI> might do what they plea&s;ed in that matter. This was writ to <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> a day or two after the former order was &s;ent. But upon it a new one went to <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> where the &s;hip lay, to &s;top her. This came before &s;he could get out. So <HI>Lockhart,</HI> be|ing informed of that, went to Court, and complained heavily. He was told, what the King him&s;elf had &s;aid about it. He an&s;wered re&s;olutely, that the King &s;poke to them only by him. Yet he wrote upon this to the Court of <HI>England,</HI> de&s;iring to be recalled, &s;ince he could &s;erve no longer with honour, after he had been &s;o di&s;owned. Upon this the King wrote him a letter with his own pen, excu&s;ing the matter the be&s;t he could; and ju&s;tified him in what he had done. And upon that &s;ecret orders were &s;ent, and the &s;hip was di&s;charged. The other was a higher point, con&s;idering the bigotry of the King of <HI>France. Lockhart</HI> had a <HI>French</HI> Popi&s;h &s;ervant, who was dying, and &s;ent for the Sacrament. Upon which it was brought with the proce&s;&s;ion ordinary in &s;uch ca&s;es. <HI>Lockhart,</HI> hearing of this, ordered his gates to be &s;hut. And upon that many were enflam|ed, and were running to force his gates: But he ordered all his fami|ly to &s;tand to their arms, and, if any force was offered, to fire. There was a great noi&s;e made of this. But no force was offered. He re&s;olved to complain fir&s;t: And &s;o went to Court, and expo&s;tulated upon it. He &s;aid, his hou&s;e was his ma&s;ter's hou&s;e: And here a publick tri|umph was attempted on his ma&s;ter's religion, and affronts were of|fered him: He &s;aid, if a Prie&s;t had brought the Sacrament private|ly, he would have connived at it: But he a&s;ked reparation for &s;o publick an injury. The King of <HI>France</HI> &s;eemed to be highly di&s;|plea&s;ed at this, calling it the greate&s;t indignity that had ever been done to his God during his reign. Yet the point did not bear arguing: So <HI>Lockhart</HI> &s;aid nothing to that. When <HI>Lockhart</HI> went from him, <HI>Pompone</HI> followed him, &s;ent after him by the King; and told him,
<PB N="391" REF="406">
he would force the King to &s;uffer none of his &s;ubjects to &s;erve him. He an&s;wered, he would order his coach-man to drive the quicker to <HI>Paris,</HI> to prevent that; and left <HI>Pompone</HI> to gue&s;s the meaning. As &s;oon as he came to his hou&s;e, he ordered all his <HI>French</HI> &s;ervants to be immediately paid off, and di&s;mi&s;s'd. The Court of <HI>England</HI> was forced to ju&s;tify him in all this matter. A publick letter of thanks was writ to him upon it. And the Court of <HI>France</HI> thought it fit to dige&s;t it. But the <HI>French</HI> King look'd on him ever after with great coldne&s;s, if not with aver&s;ion. Soon after that he fell into a lan|gui&s;hing, which after &s;ome months carried him off. I have ever look'd on him as the greate&s;t man that his country produced in this age, next to Sir <HI>Robert Murray.</HI></P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> began now to talk again&s;t the <HI>French</HI> inter|e&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">Manage|ment in <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> with open mouth. <HI>Rouvigny</HI> &s;taid but two years in <HI>England:</HI> For, tho' he &s;erved his ma&s;ter's intere&s;ts but too well, yet the Popi&s;h par|ty could not bear the want of a Chapel in the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador's hou&s;e. So he was recalled: And <HI>Courtin</HI> was &s;ent in his room. Be|fore he parted, he talked roundly with Lord <HI>Danby:</HI> He &s;aid, he was going into popular intere&s;ts again&s;t tho&s;e of his ma&s;ter's ho|nour, who having engaged the King of <HI>France</HI> in the war, and be|ing forced to leave him to fight it out alone, ought not to turn again&s;t him; e&s;pecially, &s;ince the King of <HI>France</HI> referred every thing to him as the arbiter and mediator of the peace: He remem|bred him of the old Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>'s fate, who thought to become popular by breaking the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> match; and it was his ru|in: He &s;aid, the King of <HI>France</HI> was the King's be&s;t friend, and true&s;t ally: And if he made the King for&s;ake him, and depend on his Parliament, being &s;o tempered as they were then, both the King and he might come to repent it, when it was too late. I had all this from him&s;elf. To this Lord <HI>Danby</HI> replied, that he &s;poke as a faith|ful &s;ervant to his own ma&s;ter, and that he him&s;elf would act as a faithful &s;ervant to his ma&s;ter. <HI>Courtin</HI> &s;poke a great deal to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, in the Prince of <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI>'s pre&s;ence, when I had the honour to wait on him. He told me, there was a &s;trange rever&s;e in things: Lord <HI>Danby</HI> was at that time &s;uffering for being in the <HI>French</HI> in|tere&s;t: And Lord <HI>Montague</HI> was popular as being again&s;t it: Where|as, to his knowledge, during his employment in <HI>England,</HI> Lord <HI>Dan|by</HI> was an enemy to their intere&s;t, as much as Lord <HI>Montague</HI> was for it. I can &s;ay nothing as to one point, whether any great &s;ums came over from <HI>France</HI> all this while, or not. Some watched the ri|&s;ing and falling of the exchange, by which men &s;kilful in tho&s;e mat|ters can judge, when any great &s;um pa&s;&s;es from one Kingdom to another, either in &s;pecie, or by bill: But they could never find out any thing to make them conclude it was done. Lord <HI>Montague</HI> told me, he tried often to get into that &s;ecret, but in vain: He often &s;aid

to the King, that, if he would tru&s;t him, he could make better bar|gains for him, than others had made: But the King never an&s;wer|ed him a word on that head: And he believed, that what &s;ums &s;o|ever came over, they were only to the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> or to the King's privy pur&s;e; and that the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador had the &s;ole managing of that matter, the King perhaps not being willing to tru&s;t any of his own &s;ubjects with &s;o important and &s;o dangerous a &s;ecret. In all companies the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> was declaring openly again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> and Popery. And the See of <HI>London</HI> falling then void by <HI>Henchman</HI>'s death, he brought <HI>Compton,</HI> brother to the Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> to &s;ucceed him. He was made Bi&s;hop of <HI>Oxford,</HI> upon <HI>Crew</HI>'s being promoted to <HI>Dure&s;me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Compton</HI> carried arms for &s;ome years. When he was pa&s;s'd thir|ty, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The charac|ter of &s;ome Bi&s;hops.</NOTE> he took orders. He was an humble and mode&s;t man. He appli|ed him&s;elf more to his function, than Bi&s;hops had commonly done. He went much about his dioce&s;e; and preached, and confirmed in many places. His preaching was without much life or learning: For he had not gone tho' his &s;tudies with the exactne&s;s that was fit|ting. He was a great patron of the Converts from Popery, and of tho&s;e Prote&s;tants, whom the bad u&s;age they were beginning to meet with in <HI>France</HI> drove over to us: And by the&s;e means he came to have a great reputation. He was making many complaints to the King, and often in Council, of the in&s;olence of the Papi&s;ts, and of <HI>Coleman</HI>'s in particular. So that the King ordered the Duke to di&s;|mi&s;s <HI>Coleman</HI> out of his &s;ervice. Yet he continued &s;till in his confi|dence. But with the&s;e good qualities <HI>Compton</HI> was a weak man, willful, and &s;trangely wedded to a party. He was a property to Lord <HI>Danby,</HI> and was turned by him as he plea&s;ed. The Duke hated him. But Lord <HI>Danby</HI> per&s;uaded both the King and him, that, as his heat did no great hurt to any per&s;on, &s;o the giving way to it helped to lay the jealou&s;ies of the Church party. About a year after that, <HI>Sheldon</HI> dying, <HI>Compton</HI> was per&s;uaded that Lord <HI>Dan|by</HI> had tried with all his &s;trength to promote him to <HI>Canterbury;</HI> tho' that was never once intended. There were none of the order, that were in any &s;ort fitted to fill that See, whom the Court could tru&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Sancroft,</HI> Dean of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, was rai&s;ed to it. He was a man of &s;o|lemn deportment, had a &s;ullen gravity in his looks, and was con&s;i|derably learned. He had put on a mona&s;tick &s;trictne&s;s, and lived ab&s;tracted from company. The&s;e things, together with his liv|ing unmarried, and his being fixed in the old maxims of high loy|alty, and a &s;uper&s;titious valuing of little things, made the Court con|clude, that he was a man, who might be entirely gained to &s;erve all their ends; or, at lea&s;t, that he would be an unactive &s;peculative man, and give them little oppo&s;ition in any thing that they might attempt, when they had more promi&s;ing opportunities. He was a
<PB N="393" REF="408">
dry, cold man, re&s;erved, and peevi&s;h; &s;o that none loved him, and few e&s;teemed him: Yet the high church party were well plea|&s;ed with his promotion.</P>
<P>As Lord <HI>Danby</HI> thus rai&s;ed his creatures in the Church, &s;o he got all men turned out of their places, that did not entirely de|pend on him: And went on in his credit with the King, &s;till a&s;&s;ur|ing him, that, if he would leave things to his conduct, he would cer|tainly bring about the whole Cavalier party again to him. And &s;uch was the corruption and poverty of that party, that, had it not been that <HI>French</HI> and Popi&s;h coun&s;els were &s;o vi&s;ible in the whole cour&s;e of our affairs, he had very probably gained them to have rai&s;ed the King's power, and to have extirpated the Di&s;&s;enters, and to have brought things very near to the &s;tate they were in, King <HI>Charles</HI> I's. time, before the war.</P>
<P>All this while the Papi&s;ts were not idle. They tried their &s;trength <NOTE PLACE="marg">The projects of the Pa|pi&s;ts.</NOTE> with the King to get the Parliament di&s;&s;olved: In which their hopes carried them &s;o far, that <HI>Coleman</HI> drew a declaration for ju&s;tifying it. Their de&s;ign in this was, once to divide the King and his people: For they reckoned the new Parliament would not be &s;o ea&s;y to him as this was. For how angry &s;oever this was at him, and he &s;ometimes at them, yet they &s;aw that a &s;evere Act again&s;t Popery, or &s;ome &s;teps made again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> would di&s;po&s;e them to forget all former qua|rels, and to give money. And as the King always wanted that, and loved to be ea&s;y, &s;o the pro&s;pect of it was ever in his view. They feared, that at &s;ome time or other this might make him both &s;acri|fice Popery, and for&s;ake <HI>France.</HI> So they took all po&s;&s;ible methods to engage the King to a more entire dependance on <HI>France,</HI> and to a di&s;tru&s;t of his own people. They were labouring for a general peace in all Courts, where they had any intere&s;t. The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s ob&s;tinacy was the common &s;ubject of their complaints. Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> tried, upon the Duke's concurring in the vote for an addre&s;s to have the Parliament di&s;&s;olved, if he could &s;eparate him from the Earl of <HI>Danby.</HI> And he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to him by the Lord <HI>Stafford,</HI> that his voting as he did in that matter had gain|ed much on many who were formerly his enemies: He wi&s;hed he would u&s;e his intere&s;t with the King to get that brought about: And he dur&s;t undertake, that a new Parliament &s;hould be more in|clinable to grant the Papi&s;ts a toleration, than they would ever find this would prove.</P>
<P>But the Duke and Lord <HI>Danby</HI> were too firmly united to be ea|&s;ily <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coleman</HI>'s intrigues.</NOTE> divided: For whatever Lord <HI>Danby</HI> gave out, he made the Duke believe, that all that he intended would really turn to his &s;ervice. <HI>Coleman</HI> was very bu&s;y in writing many letters to all places, but chief|ly to the Court of <HI>France.</HI> He was in all his di&s;patches &s;etting forth the good &s;tate of the Duke's affairs, and the great &s;trength he was
<PB N="394" REF="409">
daily gaining. He was either very &s;anguine, if he believed this him|&s;elf, or very bold in offering to impo&s;e it &s;o po&s;itively on others. He was always full of a&s;&s;urances, that, if a peace could be brought about, &s;o that the King of <HI>France</HI> was &s;et at liberty to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with his pur&s;e, and his force, they were never in &s;uch hopes in &s;uc|ceeding in the great de&s;ign of rooting out this pe&s;tilent here&s;y, that had &s;o long over-run the&s;e northern Kingdoms, as now. He had a friend, one Sir <HI>William Throgmorton,</HI> of whom he intended to make great u&s;e. He and his wife had prevailed with him and his Lady to change their religion. And &s;o he &s;ent them over to <HI>France,</HI> recom|mending him to the King's confe&s;&s;or, <HI>F. Ferrier,</HI> as a man that might do them great &s;ervice, if he could be made one of theirs. So <HI>Ferrier,</HI> looking on him as a man of importance, applied him&s;elf to turn him, which was &s;oon done. And the confe&s;&s;or, to rai&s;e the value of his convert, &s;poke of him to the King in &s;uch a &s;train, that he was much con&s;idered. When his Lady abjured, the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> led her up to the altar. He took great &s;tate on him, and &s;oon &s;pent all he had. He was a bu&s;y man between the two Courts. But, before he got into any con&s;iderable po&s;t, <HI>Ferrier</HI> died: And the new confe&s;&s;or did not take &s;uch care of him as his predece&s;&s;or had done. So he was forced to quit his high living, and retire to a pri|vate hou&s;e. And he &s;ent his Lady into a mona&s;tery. Yet he conti|nued &s;till to be <HI>Coleman</HI>'s agent, and corre&s;pondent. He went often to &s;ee an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lady, that was of their religion, Lady <HI>Brown.</HI> And, being one day with her, he received a deep wound by a knife &s;truck into his thigh, that pierced the great artery. Whether the Lady did it to defend her &s;elf, or he to &s;hew the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion, was not known. It was not po&s;&s;ible to &s;top the bleeding. Yet the Lady would have him carried out of her hou&s;e. He died in the hou&s;e of one <HI>Hollman,</HI> an eminent man of their religion, then at <HI>Paris.</HI> The whole matter was carried off in &s;uch &s;ecrecy, that <HI>Lock|hart,</HI> then at <HI>Paris,</HI> could never penetrate farther into it. I had this from his Lady after his death.</P>
<P><HI>Coleman</HI> quickly found out another corre&s;pondent, that was more u&s;eful to him than he whom he lo&s;t could ever have been, F. <HI>St. German,</HI> a Je&s;uit, who was &s;ent over with the Duche&s;s, and pa&s;s'd for her confe&s;&s;or, tho' I have been a&s;&s;ured that was a mi&s;take. He had all the heat of his order in him, and was apt to talk very boldly. I was &s;ometimes in company with him. He was complained of in Council by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> for &s;ome practice on one that was come over a convert, whom he was between threatning and per|&s;ua&s;ion working on, in order to the &s;ending him back. This came to be di&s;covered. Upon which he fled. And on him <HI>Coleman</HI> fixed for his chief corre&s;pondent. <HI>Howard</HI> was about this time by Cardi|nal <HI>Altieri</HI>'s means promoted to be a Cardinal. And upon that the

King and Duke &s;ent complements to <HI>Rome.</HI> This opened a nego|tiation with that Court, that was put in the hands of the <HI>Inter$$ncio</HI> at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els.</HI> So it was propo&s;ed, that a &s;um of mon$y &s;hould be giv|en the King, if in return of that &s;ome &s;uitable favours for tho&s;e of their religion could be obtained. <HI>Coleman</HI> was &s;ent over by the Duke to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> to treat about it, none being in the &s;ecret, but the Lord <HI>Arundell.</HI> Yet, as he under&s;tood it, the King him&s;elf knew of it. When he went thinther, he found the &s;um offered was &s;o &s;mall, and the conditions demanded were &s;o high, that he made no progre&s;s in the negotiation. What&s;oever <HI>Coleman</HI> did in the main bu&s;ine&s;s, he took good care of him&s;elf. All his letters were full of their be|ing able to do nothing for want of money. And he made the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador believe, he could do his ma&s;ter great &s;ervice, if he was well &s;upplied. He got once 2500 guineas from him, to gain his ma&s;ter &s;ome friends. But he applied it all to furni&s;h out his own expence. He was at that time &s;o lifted up, that he had a mind to pa&s;s for the head of the party. And of this I will give one in&s;tance, in which I my &s;elf had a &s;hare.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Philip Terwhit,</HI> a Papi&s;t, had married a zealous Prote&s;tant, who &s;u&s;pecting his religion charged him with it. But he denied it before marriage; and carried that &s;o far, that he received the Sacra|ment with her in her own Church. After they were married, &s;he found that he had deceived her: And they lived untowardly toge|ther. At this time &s;ome &s;cruples were put in her head, with which &s;he acquainted me, and &s;eemed fully &s;atisfied with the an&s;wers that I gave her. She came afterwards to me, and de&s;ired, I would come to her hou&s;e, and talk of all tho&s;e matters with &s;ome that her hu&s;|band would bring to meet us. I told her, I would not decline the thing, if de&s;ired, tho' I &s;eldom knew good come of &s;uch conferences. She made the &s;ame propo&s;ition to Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet;</HI> and he gave the &s;ame an&s;wer. So a day was &s;et, and we went thither, and found ten <NOTE PLACE="marg">A confe|rence be|tween <HI>Cole|man</HI> and &s;ome di|vines.</NOTE> or twelve per&s;ons, that were not known to us. We were &s;carce &s;et down, when <HI>Coleman</HI> came in, who took the whole debate upon him. I writ down a very exact account of all that pa&s;s'd, and &s;ent it to them, and had their additions to it: And I printed it. The thing made a great noi&s;e, and was a new indication of <HI>Coleman</HI>'s arrogance. Soon after that the Lady, who continued firm upon this conference, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with new &s;cruples about the validity of our ordinations. I got from her the paper that was put in her hand, and an&s;wered it: And &s;he &s;eemed &s;atisfied with that likewi&s;e. But afterwards the unea&s;ine&s;s of her life prevailed more on her, than her &s;cruples did; and &s;he changed her religion.</P>
<P>Some time after I had printed the Memoirs of the Dukes of <NOTE PLACE="marg">I undertook to w$span$e the $word$ of $word$ Refor|mation.</NOTE> <HI>Hamilton,</HI> which were favourably received, the reading of the&s;e got me the acquaintance and friend&s;hip of Sir <HI>William J$$es,</HI> then At|torney

General. He was rai&s;ed to that high po&s;t merely by merit, and by his being thought the greate&s;t man of the law: For, as he was no flatterer, but a man of a moro&s;e temper, &s;o he was again&s;t all the mea&s;ures that they took at Court. They were weary of him, and were rai&s;ing Sir <HI>John King</HI> to vie with him: But he died in his ri&s;e, which indeed went on very quick. <HI>Jones</HI> was an hone&s;t, and wi&s;e man. He had a roughne&s;s in his deportment, that was very di&s;agreeable: But he was a good natured man at bottom, and a faith|ful friend. He grew weary of his employment, and laid it down: And, tho' the Great Seal was offered him, he would not accept of it, nor return to bu&s;ine&s;s. The quickne&s;s of his thoughts carried his views far. And the &s;ourne&s;s of his temper made him too apt both to &s;u&s;pect and to de&s;pi&s;e mo&s;t of tho&s;e that came to him. My way of writing hi&s;tory pleas'd him: And &s;o he pre&s;&s;ed me to under|take the hi&s;tory of <HI>England.</HI> But <HI>Sanders</HI>'s book, that was then tran|&s;lated into <HI>French,</HI> and cried up much in <HI>France,</HI> made all my friends pre&s;s me to an&s;wer it, by writing the hi&s;tory of the Reformation. So now all my thoughts were turned that way. I laid out for <HI>MSS,</HI> and &s;earched into all offices. I got for &s;ome days into the <HI>Cotton</HI> library. But Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> hearing of my de&s;ign, and appre|hending it might &s;ucceed in my hands, got <HI>Dolben,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ro|che&s;ter,</HI> to divert Sir <HI>John Cotton</HI> from &s;uffering me to &s;carch into his library. He told him, I was a great enemy to the prerogative, to which <HI>Cotton</HI> was devoted, even to &s;lavery. So he &s;aid, I would certain|ly make an ill u&s;e of all I had found. This wrought &s;o much on him, that I was no more admitted, till my fir&s;t volume was publi&s;hed. And then, when he &s;aw how I had compo&s;ed it, he gave me free acce&s;s to it.</P>
<P>At this time the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was brought over from being Lord <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s cha|racter.</NOTE> Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who&s;e friend&s;hip to me was afterwards &s;uch, that I think my &s;elf obliged to &s;top, and to give &s;ome account of him. He was the Lord <HI>Capell</HI>'s &s;on. His education was neglected by rea&s;on of the war. But, when he was at man's age, he made him|&s;elf ma&s;ter of the <HI>Latin</HI> tongue, and made a great progre&s;s in ma|thematicks, and in all the other parts of learning. He knew our law and con&s;titution well, and was a very thoughtful man. He be|gan &s;oon to appear again&s;t the Court. The King imputed it to his re&s;entments: So he re&s;olved to make u&s;e of him. He &s;ent him Emba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Denmark,</HI> where his behaviour in the affair of the flag gained him much reputation: Tho' he &s;aid to me there was nothing in it. That King had ordered the Governour of <HI>Croonenburgh</HI> to make all &s;hips that pa&s;s'd &s;trike to him. So when Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was &s;ailing by, he &s;ent to him, either to &s;trike to him, or to &s;ail by in the night, or to keep out of his reach: Otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t &s;hoot, fir&s;t with powder, but next with ball. Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;ent him a re&s;olute an&s;wer, that the Kings of <HI>England</HI> made others &s;trike
<PB N="397" REF="412">
to them, but their &s;hips &s;truck to none: He would not &s;teal thro' in the dark, nor keep out of his reach: And if he &s;hot at him, he would defend him&s;elf. The Governour did &s;hoot at him, but on de&s;ign <NOTE PLACE="marg">His employ|ment in <HI>Denmark.</HI></NOTE> &s;hot over him. This was thought great bravery in him: Yet he reckoned, it was impo&s;&s;ible the Governour would endeavour to &s;ink a &s;hip that brought over an Emba&s;&s;ador. While he was there, the King died, which made a great change in the Court. For that King had made one of his &s;ervants Stadtholder; which was indeed a &s;trange thing, he him&s;elf being upon the place. He was but a mean per&s;on, and was advanced by the favour the Queen bore him. Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s was to ju&s;tify his behaviour in refu&s;ing to &s;trike. Now at his going from <HI>England</HI> Sir <HI>John Cotton</HI> had de&s;ired him to take &s;ome volumes of his library that related to <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> affairs; which he took, without apprehending that he &s;hould have great occa&s;ion to u&s;e them: But this accident made him &s;earch into them. And he found very good materials to ju&s;tify his conduct; &s;ince by formal treaties it had been expre&s;&s;ly &s;tipulated, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hips of war &s;hould not &s;trike in the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> &s;eas. This rai&s;ed his character &s;o high at Court, that it was writ over to him, that he might expect every thing he &s;hould pretend to at his return. The change of go|vernment that he &s;aw in <HI>Denmark,</HI> and the bringing it about with &s;o little difficulty, made a great impre&s;&s;ion on him; &s;ince one of the free&s;t Nations in the world was on a &s;udden brought under a mo&s;t arbitrary form of government. Many of the ancient Nobility &s;eemed unea&s;y under the change. And even the Chancellor him|&s;elf, tho' rai&s;ed by favour from very mean beginnings, could not forbear to lament even to him the change of their con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Upon his return from <HI>Denmark,</HI> he was made Lord Lieutenant <NOTE PLACE="marg">And his go|vernment of <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Ireland.</HI> He could never under&s;tand how he came to be rai&s;ed to that po&s;t; for he had not pretended to it: And he was a violent enemy to Popery; not &s;o much from any fix'd principle in religion, in which he was too loo&s;e, as becau&s;e he looked on it as an inva&s;i|on made on the freedom of human nature. In his government of <HI>Ireland</HI> he exceeded all that had gone before him; and is &s;till con|&s;idered as a pattern to all that come after him. He &s;tudied to un|der&s;tand exactly well the con&s;titution, and intere&s;t of the Nation. He read over all their Council books; and made large ab&s;tracts out of them, to guide him, &s;o as to advance every thing that had been at any time &s;et on foot for the good of the Kingdom. He made &s;e|veral volumes of tables of the &s;tate, and per&s;ons that were in every county and town; and got true characters of all that were capable to &s;erve the publick. And he preferred men always upon merit, with|out any application from them&s;elves; and watched over all ab$span$ him, that there &s;hould be no bribes going among his &s;er$span$. The revenue of <HI>Ireland</HI> was then in the Earl of <HI>Ra$$lagh</HI>'s ma$$g$m$$t&punc;
<PB N="398" REF="413">
who was one of the able&s;t men that I&s;land had bred, capable of all affairs, even in the mid&s;t of a loo&s;e run of plea&s;ure, and much ri|ot. He had the art of plea&s;ing ma&s;ters of very different tempers and intere&s;ts &s;o much, that he continued above thirty years in great po&s;ts. He had undertaken to furni&s;h the King with money for the building of <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> out of the revenue of <HI>Ireland.</HI> And it was believed the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> had a great yearly pen&s;ion out of his office. By this means payments in <HI>Ireland</HI> were not regularly made. So the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> complained of this. The King would not own how much he had from Lord <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> but pre&s;s'd Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> to pa&s;s his accounts. He an&s;wered, he could not pa&s;s them as accounts: But, if the King would forgive Lord <HI>Ranelagh,</HI> he would pa&s;s a di&s;charge, but not an ill account. The King was not plea&s;ed with this, nor with his exactne&s;s in that government: It reproached his own too much. So he took a re&s;olution about this time to put the Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> in it again. Upon this occa&s;ion the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> told me, that he knew the King did often take money into his privy pur&s;e, to de|fraud his Exchequer: For he reckoned that what was carried thither, was not &s;o much his own, as his privy pur&s;e was. And <HI>Coventry</HI> told Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> that there was once a Plantation-cau&s;e at the Council board: And he was troubled to &s;ee the King e&s;pou&s;e the wor&s;t &s;ide: And upon that he went to him, and told him &s;ecretly, that it was a vile cau&s;e which he was &s;upporting: The King an&s;wered him, he had got good money for doing it.</P>
<P>About this time there was a propo&s;ition made for farming the re|venue of <HI>Ireland.</HI> And Lord <HI>Danby</HI> &s;eemed for &s;ome time to favour one &s;et of men, who offered to farm it. But on the &s;udden he turn|ed to another. The &s;ecret of this broke out, that he was to have great advantages by the &s;econd propo&s;ition. The matter was brought to the Council table: And &s;ome were examined to it upon oath. Lord <HI>Widrington</HI> did confe&s;s that he made offer of a round &s;um to Lord <HI>Danby,</HI> but &s;aid that he did not accept of it. Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> was yet of the Council. So he ob&s;erved that the Lord Trea&s;urer had rejected that offer very mildly; but not &s;o as to di&s;courage a &s;econd attempt: It would be &s;omewhat &s;trange, if a man &s;hould a&s;k the u&s;e of another man's wife, and if the other &s;hould indeed refu&s;e it, but with great civility. This nettled Lord <HI>Danby,</HI> who upon that got him to be di&s;mi&s;s'd from that board: At which the Duke was much plea&s;ed, who hated Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> at that time, more even than the Earl of <HI>Sha&s;tsbiny</HI> him&s;elf; for he had fallen &s;everely on the declaration for toleration in the Hou&s;e of Lords. He &s;aid, if we could make good the Ea&s;tern complement, <HI>O King live for ever,</HI> he could tru&s;t the King with everything; but &s;ince that was &s;o much a complement, that it could never become real, he could not be implicite in his confidence. Thus matters went on all 16-6, and to the begin|ning
<PB N="399" REF="414">
of the 1677, when another &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament was held. I have brought within this year &s;everal things that may be of u&s;e to en|lighten the reader as to the &s;tate of things, tho' perhaps of their own nature they were not important enough to de&s;erve to be told. But in &s;o bare a year, as this proved to be, it &s;eemed no impertinent digre&s;&s;ion, to bring all &s;uch matters into the reader's way.</P>
<P>I &s;hall next give &s;ome account of <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> affairs. The Duke of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The affairs of <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Lauderdale</HI> had ma&s;tered the oppo&s;ition made to him &s;o entirely, that men were now tho' &s;ilent, not quiet. The field Conventicles increa&s;ed mightily. Men came to them armed. And upon that great numbers were outlawed: And a writ was i&s;&s;ued out, that was indeed legal, but very &s;eldom u&s;ed, called Intercommoning: Becau&s;e it made all that harboured &s;uch per&s;ons, or did not &s;eize them, when they had it in their power, to be involved in the &s;ame guilt. By this means many, apprehending a &s;evere pro&s;ecution, left their hou&s;es, and went about like a &s;ort of Banditti, and fell under a fierce and &s;avage temper. The Privy Council upon this pretended they were in a &s;tate of war. And upon an old &s;tatute, that was almo&s;t quite forgot, it was &s;et on foot, that the King had a power to take any Ca&s;tle that lay convenient for his forces, and put a garri&s;on in it. So twelve hou&s;es were marked out: Of which two were the chief dwelling hou&s;es of two Peers. The re&s;t were the hou&s;es of gentlemen, that had gone into the party again&s;t Duke <HI>Lauderdale.</HI> And, tho' the&s;e were hou&s;es of no &s;trength, and not at all properly &s;ituated for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of Conventicles, yet they were taken. Soldiers were put in them. And the countries about were required to furni&s;h tho&s;e &s;mall garri&s;ons with all things nece&s;&s;ary. This was again&s;t the expre&s;s words of the law that had lately &s;ettled the militia. Great oppo&s;ition was made to it. Yet it was kept up above a year, till the hou&s;es were quite ruined by the rude &s;oldiers, who under&s;tood that the more wa&s;te they made it would be the more acceptable. At la&s;t it was let fall.</P>
<P>Another thing happened, &s;carce worth mentioning, if it was not for the effects that followed on it. One <HI>Car&s;tairs,</HI> a loo&s;e and vici|ous gentleman, who had ruined his e&s;tate, undertook to <HI>Sharp</HI> to go about in di&s;gui&s;e to &s;ee tho&s;e Conventicles, and to carry &s;ome with him to witne&s;s again&s;t &s;uch as they &s;aw at them; in which he him&s;elf was not to appear: But he was to have a proportion of all the fines that &s;hould be &s;et upon this evidence: And he was to have &s;o much for every one of their teachers that he could catch. He had many different di&s;gui&s;es, and pa&s;&s;ed by different names in every one of them. He found <HI>Kirkton,</HI> an eminent preacher among them, who was as cautious as the re&s;t were bold, and had avoided all &s;u&s;|pitious and dangerous meetings. <HI>Car&s;tairs,</HI> &s;eeing him walking on the &s;treets of <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> told him, there was a per&s;on that was &s;ick, and &s;ent him to beg a vi&s;it from him. He &s;u&s;pecting nothing went
<PB N="400" REF="415">
with him. <HI>Car&s;tairs</HI> brought him to his own lodgings: And there he told him, he had a warrant again&s;t him, which he would execute, if he would not give him money to let him alone. <HI>Kirkton</HI> &s;aid, he had not offended, and was willing to go to pri&s;on till his innocence &s;hould appear. <HI>Car&s;tairs</HI> really had no warrant: But, as was afterwards di&s;covered, he had often taken this method, and had got money by it. So he went out to procure a warrant, and left <HI>Kirkton</HI> lock'd up in his chamber. <HI>Kirkton</HI> called to the people of the hou&s;e: And told them, how he was trepan'd. And he got one of them to &s;eek <HI>Baillie</HI> of <HI>Jerri&s;wood,</HI> his brother-in-law, who was a Gentleman of great parts, but of much greater vertue. <HI>Car&s;tairs</HI> could not find nine Privy Coun&s;ellors to &s;ign a warrant, which were the number required by law. Yet, when he came back, he pretended he had a warrant, and would force <HI>Kirkton</HI> to go to pri&s;on upon it. <HI>Kirkton</HI> refu&s;ed to obey any &s;uch warrant, till he &s;aw it. And upon that <HI>Car|&s;tairs</HI> &s;truggled, and pulled him to the ground, and &s;ate on him, the other crying out murther. At that time <HI>Baillie</HI> came to the door: And, hearing him cry out, he called to <HI>Car&s;tairs</HI> to open the door: And, that not being done, he forced it, and found <HI>Car&s;tairs</HI> &s;itting upon <HI>Kirkton.</HI> He drew his &s;word, and made him come off him. He then a&s;ked him, what warrant he had to u&s;e him as he did. He &s;aid, he had a warrant to carry him to pri&s;on: But he refu&s;ed to &s;hew it. <HI>Baillie</HI> offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t in executing it, if he had any: But he per|&s;i&s;ted in this, that he was not bound to &s;hew it. <HI>Baillie</HI> made <HI>Kirk|ton</HI> to go out; and followed him, no violence being u&s;ed; for which he had many witne&s;&s;es, whom the noi&s;e had brought together. And he &s;aid, he was re&s;olved to &s;ue <HI>Car&s;tairs</HI> for this riot. But before the next Council day a warrant was &s;igned by nine Privy Coun&s;el|lors, but antedated, for the committing of <HI>Kirkton,</HI> and of &s;ix or &s;even more of their preachers. Lord <HI>Athol</HI> told me, he was one of tho&s;e who &s;igned it, with that fal&s;e date to it. So <HI>Baillie</HI> was cited be|fore the Council: <HI>Car&s;tairs</HI> produced his warrant, which he pretend|ed he had at the time that <HI>Kirkton</HI> was in his hands, but did not think fit to &s;hew, &s;ince that would di&s;cover the names of others, again&s;t whom he was al&s;o to make u&s;e of it. <HI>Baillie</HI> brought his wit|ne&s;&s;es to prove his behaviour. But they would not &s;o much as ex|amine them. It was &s;aid, that upon <HI>Car&s;tairs</HI> &s;aying he had a warrant <HI>Kirkton</HI> was bound to go to joyl; and that, if it had been found that he was carried thither without a warrant, the jaylor would not have received him. Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and Lord <HI>Kinkardin,</HI> were yet upon the Council. And they argued long again&s;t this way of proceeding, as liker a Court of Inqui&s;ition, than a legal government. Yet <HI>Baillie</HI> was fined 500 <HI>l,</HI> and condemn'd to a year's impri&s;onment. And upon this an occa&s;ion was taken to turn Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> and Lord <HI>Kinkar+din</HI> out of the Council, as enemies to the Church, and as favourers of Conventicles.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="416">
The Parliament of <HI>England</HI> had been prorogued for about <NOTE PLACE="marg">1677 A que&s;tion rai&s;ed in <HI>England</HI> a|bout the le|gality of a prorogation.</NOTE> a year and &s;ome months, by two different prorogations. One of the&s;e was for more than a year. So upon that it was made a que&s;tion, whether by that the Parliament was not di&s;&s;olv|ed. The argument for it was laid thus. By the ancient laws a Parliament was to be held <HI>once a year, and oftener if need be:</HI> It was &s;aid, the words, <HI>if need be,</HI> in one act, which were not in another that enacted an annual Parliament with|out that addition, did not belong to the whole period, by which a &s;e&s;&s;ion was only to be held once a year if it was needful; but belonged only to the word <HI>oftener:</HI> So that the law was po&s;itive for a Parliament once a year: And if &s;o, then any act contrary to that law was an unlawful act: By con&s;equence, it could have no operation: From whence it was inferred, that the prorogation which did run beyond a year, and by con&s;equence made that the Parliament could not &s;it that year, was illegal; and that therefore the Parlia|ment could not &s;it by virtue of &s;uch an illegal act. Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> laid hold on this with great joy, and he thought to work his point by it. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> was for every thing that would embroil matters. The Earl of <HI>Salis|bury</HI> was brought into it, who was a high &s;pirited man, and had a very ill opinion of the Court. Lord <HI>Wharton</HI> went al&s;o into it. And Lord <HI>Hollis</HI> writ a book for it: But a fit of the gout kept him out of the way. All the re&s;t of the par|ty was again&s;t it. They &s;aid, it was a &s;ubtilty: And it was very dangerous to hang &s;o much weight upon &s;uch weak grounds. The words, <HI>if need be,</HI> had been under&s;tood to belong to the whole act: And the long Parliament did not pretend to make annual Parliaments nece&s;&s;ary, but in&s;i&s;ted only on a triennial Parliament: If there had been need of a Parliament during that long prorogation, the King by pro|clamation might have di&s;&s;olved it, and called a new one. All that knew the temper of the Hou&s;e of Commons were much troubled at this di&s;pute, that was like to ri&s;e on &s;uch a point. It was very certain the majority of both Hou&s;es, who only could judge it, would be again&s;t it. And they thought &s;uch an attempt to force a di&s;&s;olution, would make the Commons do every thing that the Court de&s;ired. Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> &s;et him&s;elf much again&s;t this; and did it not with|out expre&s;&s;ing great &s;harpne&s;s again&s;t Lord <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> who could not be managed in this matter. So, upon the fir&s;t open|ing the &s;e&s;&s;ion, the debate was brought on: And the&s;e Lords &s;tood again&s;t the whole Hou&s;e. That matter was &s;oon de|cided by a que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="417">
But then a &s;econd debate ro&s;e, which held for two days, whether the&s;e Lords were not liable to cen&s;ure, for offering a debate, that might create great di&s;tractions in the &s;ubject's minds, concerning the legality of Parlia|ment. Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> with the re&s;t of the party ar|gued again&s;t it &s;trongly. They &s;aid, if an idle motion was made, and checked at fir&s;t, he that made it might be cen|&s;ured for it, tho' it was &s;eldom, if ever, to be practi&s;ed in a free Council, where every man was not bound to be wi&s;e, nor to make no impertinent motion: But when the motion was entertained, and a debate followed, and a que&s;tion was put upon it, it was de&s;tructive to the freedom of publick Councils, to call any one to an account for it: They might with <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lords that moved it &s;ent to the Tower.</NOTE> the &s;ame ju&s;tice call them to an account for their debates and votes: So that no man was &s;afe, unle&s;s he could know where the majority would be: Here would be a precedent to tip down &s;o many Lords at a time, and to garboil the Hou&s;e, as often as any party &s;hould have a great majority. It was &s;aid on the other hand, here was a de&s;ign to put the Nation into great di&s;order, and to bring the legality of a Parliament into di&s;pute. So it was carried to oblige them to a&s;k pardon as delinquents: Otherwi&s;e it was re&s;olved to &s;end them to the Tower. They refu&s;ed to a&s;k pardon; and &s;o were &s;ent thither. The Earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI> was the fir&s;t that was called on: For the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> went out of the Hou&s;e. He de&s;ired, he might have his &s;ervants to wait on him: And the fir&s;t he named was his cook; which the King re&s;ented highly, as carrying in it an in&s;inuation of the wor&s;t &s;ort. The Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> made the &s;ame demand. But the Lord <HI>Wharton</HI> did not a&s;k for his cook. The Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> came in next day; and was &s;ent after them to the Tower. And they were ordered to continue pri&s;oners during the plea&s;ure of the Hou&s;e, or during the King's plea|&s;ure. They were much vi&s;ited. So to check that, tho' no complaint was made of their behaviour, they were made clo&s;e pri&s;oners, not to be vi&s;ited without leave from the King, or the Hou&s;e: And particular ob&s;ervations were made of all tho&s;e that a&s;ked leave. This was much cried out on: And the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI>'s long impri&s;onment afterwards, was thought a ju&s;t retaliation for the violence with which he drove this on. Three of the Lords lay in the Tower for &s;ome months: But they were &s;et at liberty upon their petitioning the King. Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> would not petition: But he moved in the King's Bench that he might be di&s;charged. The King's
<PB N="403" REF="418">
ju&s;tice, he &s;aid, was to be di&s;pen&s;ed in that Court. The Court &s;aid, he was committed by an order from the Hou&s;e of Lords, which was a Court &s;uperior to them: So they could take no cognizance of the matter. Lord <HI>Danby</HI> cen|&s;ured this motion highly, as done in contempt of the Hou&s;e of Lords; and &s;aid, he would make u&s;e of it again&s;t him next &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament. Yet he was often forced to make the &s;ame motion at that bar: And he complained of the in|ju&s;tice of the Court for refu&s;ing to bail or di&s;charge him, tho' in that they followed the precedent, which at this time was directed by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The debate about the di&s;&s;olution of the Parliament, had <NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings in Parlia|ment.</NOTE> the effect in the Hou&s;e of Commons that was for&s;een: For the Commons were much inflamed again&s;t Lord <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> and his party. They at fir&s;t voted 600000 <HI>l.</HI> for the build|ing thirty &s;hips: For they re&s;olved to begin with a popu|lar bill. A clau&s;e was put in the bill by the Country party, that the money &s;hould be accounted for to the Commons, in hope that the Lords would alter that clau&s;e, and make it accountable to both Hou&s;es; which was done by the Lords, and conferences were held upon it. The Lords thought, that, &s;ince they paid their &s;hare of the tax, it was not rea|&s;onable to exclude them from the accounts. The Commons adhered to their clau&s;e: And the bill was in great danger of being lo&s;t. But the King prevailed with the Lords to re|cede. An additional exci&s;e, that had been formerly given, was now falling: So they continued that for three years lon|ger. And they were in all things &s;o compliant, that the Court had not for many years had &s;o hopeful a &s;e&s;&s;ion as this was. But all was changed of a &s;udden.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>France</HI> was then making one of his early <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Flanders.</HI></NOTE> campaigns in <HI>Flanders;</HI> in which he at fir&s;t took <HI>Valencien|nes,</HI> and then divided his Army in two. He with one be|&s;ieged <HI>Cambray:</HI> And the other commanded by his brother be&s;ieged St. <HI>Omer.</HI> But, tho' I intend to &s;ay little of foreign affairs, yet where I came to the knowledge of particulars that I have not &s;een in any printed relations, I will venture to &s;et them down. <HI>Turenne</HI>'s death was a great blow to the King of <HI>France;</HI> but not to his Mini&s;ters, whom he de&s;pi&s;|ed, and who hated him. But the King had &s;uch a per&s;o|nal regard to him, that they were afraid of oppo&s;ing him too much. He was both the mo&s;t cautious, and the mo&s;t oblig|ing General that ever commanded an Army. He had the art of making every man love him, except tho&s;e that thought
<PB N="404" REF="419">
they came in &s;ome competition with him: For he was apt to treat them with too much contempt. It was an extraor|dinary thing that a random cannon &s;hot &s;hould have killed him. He &s;at by the balance of his body a while on the &s;ad|dle, but fell down dead in the place: And a great de&s;ign he had, which probably would have been fatal to the <HI>German</HI> Army, died with him. The Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;</HI> was &s;ent to command the Army to his great affliction: For this was a declaration, that he was e&s;teemed inferior to <HI>Turenne,</HI> which he could not well bear, tho' he was inferior to him in all that related to the command; unle&s;s it was in a day of bat|tel, in which the pre&s;ence of mind, and vivacity of thought, which were wonderful in him, gave him &s;ome advantage. But he had too much pride, to be &s;o obliging as a General ought to be. And he was too much a &s;lave to plea&s;ure, and gamed too much, to have that con&s;tant application to his bu&s;ine&s;s that the other had. He was entirely lo&s;t in the King's good opinion, not only by rea&s;on of his behaviour during his minority. But, after that was forgiven, once when the King was ill, not without apprehen&s;ions, he &s;ent for him, and recommended his &s;on to his care, in ca&s;e he &s;hould die at that time. But he, in&s;tead of receiving this, as a great mark of confidence, with due acknowledgments, expo&s;tulat|ed upon the ill u&s;age he had met with. The King reco|vered; but never forgot that treatment, and took all occa&s;i|ons to mortify him; which the Mini&s;ters knew well, and &s;econded him in it: So that, bating the outward re&s;pect due to his birth, they treated him very hardly in all his preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King came down to <HI>Flanders</HI> in 76, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> King declin|ed a battle when offer|ed by the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></NOTE> fir&s;t took <HI>Cond&egrave;,</HI> and then be&s;ieged <HI>Bouchain.</HI> The &s;iege went on in form: And the King lay with an Army covering it, when on a &s;udden the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> drew his Army together, and went up almo&s;t to the King's camp, offering him battle. All the Mar&s;hals and Generals con|cluded that battle was to be given, and that the war would be that day ended. The King heard all this coldly. <HI>Schom|berg</HI> was newly made a Mar&s;hal, and had got great honour the year before again&s;t the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> in rai&s;ing the &s;iege of <HI>Mae&s;trickt.</HI> He commanded in a quarter at &s;ome di&s;tance. The King &s;aid, he would come to no re&s;olution, till he heard his opinion. <HI>Louvoy</HI> &s;ent for him by a confident per|&s;on, whom he ordered to tell him what had happen'd; and that, in any opinion he was to give, he mu&s;t con&s;ider the King's per&s;on. So, when he came to the King's tent, a council of
<PB N="405" REF="420">
war was called: And <HI>Schomberg</HI> was ordered to deliver his opi|nion fir&s;t. He &s;aid, the King was there on de&s;ign to cover the &s;iege of <HI>Bouchain:</HI> A young General was come up on a de&s;perate humour to offer him battle: He did not doubt, but it would be a glorious deci&s;ion of the war: But the King ought to con&s;ider his own de&s;igns, and not to be led out of the&s;e by any bravado, or even by the great hope of &s;ucce&s;s: The King ought to remain in his po&s;t, till the place was taken: Otherwi&s;e he &s;uffered another man to be the ma&s;ter of his coun&s;els and actions. When the place was taken, then he was to come to new coun&s;els: But till then he thought he was to pur&s;ue his fir&s;t de&s;ign. The King &s;aid <HI>Schomberg</HI> was in the right: And he was applauded that day, as a better Courtier than a General. I had all this from his own mouth.</P>
<P>To this I will add a plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;age, that the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;</HI> told young <HI>Rouvigny,</HI> now Earl of <HI>Galloway.</HI> The King of <HI>France</HI> has never yet fought a battel; and has a mighty notion of that matter: And, it &s;eems, he apprehends the dan|ger of it too much. Once he was chiding the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> for his being about to fight a combat with a man of quality. The King told him, he ought to con&s;ider the dignity of his blood, and not put him&s;elf on the level with other &s;ubjects; and that his uncle had declined fighting on that very account. The Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> an&s;wered, my uncle might well have done &s;o, after he had won two battels; but I, who have yet done no|thing, mu&s;t pretend to no &s;uch di&s;tinction. The King told this an&s;wer to the Prince of <HI>Cond&egrave;,</HI> who &s;aw he was nettled with it. So he &s;aid to him, that his nephew had in that &s;poke like a young man: For winning of a battel was no great matter; &s;ince, tho' he who commanded had the glory of it, yet it was the &s;ubalterns that did the bu&s;ine&s;s: In which he thought he plea&s;ed the King; and for which he laughed hear|tily at him, when he told the &s;tory. The late King told me, that in the&s;e campaigns the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were both &s;o ignorant and &s;o backward, &s;o proud and yet &s;o weak, that they would never own their feeblene&s;s, or their wants, to him. They pretended they had &s;tores, when they had none; and thou|&s;ands, when they &s;carce had hundreds. He had in their coun|&s;els often de&s;ired, that they would give him only a true &s;tate of their garri&s;ons and magazines. But they always gave it fal&s;e. So that for &s;ome campaigns all was lo&s;t, merely becau&s;e they deceived him in the &s;trength they pretended they had. At la&s;t he believed nothing they &s;aid, but &s;ent his own officers to examine every thing. <HI>Monterey</HI> was a wi&s;e man, and a good
<PB N="406" REF="421">
Governor, but was a coward. <HI>Villa Hermo&s;a</HI> was a brave man, but ignorant and weak. Thus the Prince had a &s;ad time of it every campaign. But none was &s;o unhappy as this: In which, upon the lo&s;s of <HI>Valenciennes,</HI> he looking on St. <HI>Omer</HI> as more important than <HI>Cambray,</HI> went thither, and ventured a battle too ra&s;hly. <HI>Luxembourgh,</HI> with a great body of hor&s;e, came into the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI>'s Army, ju&s;t as they were engag|ing. Some regiments of marines, on whom the Prince de|pended much, did ba&s;ely run away. Yet the other bodies fought &s;o well, that he lo&s;t not much, be&s;ides the honour of the day. But upon that St. <HI>Omer</HI> did immediately capitulate, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>$word$</HI> and St <HI>Omer</HI> $$ken.</NOTE> as <HI>Cambray</HI> did &s;ome days after. It was thought, that the King was jealous of the honour his brother had got in that action; for he never had the command of an army after that time: And, courage being the chief good quality that he had, it was thought his having no occa&s;ion given him to &s;hew it flowed from &s;ome particular rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The&s;e things happening during this Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, made <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hou&s;e of Com|mons pre&s;&s;|ed the King to engage in the war.</NOTE> great impre&s;&s;ion on all peoples minds. Sir <HI>W. Coventry</HI> opened the bu&s;ine&s;s in the Hou&s;e of Commons; and &s;hewed the danger of all the&s;e Provinces falling under the power of <HI>France;</HI> which mu&s;t end in the ruin of the United Provinces, if a timely &s;top were not put to the progre&s;s the <HI>French</HI> were making. He demon&s;trat|ed, that the intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> made it nece&s;&s;ary for the King to withdraw his mediation, and enter into the alliance again&s;t <HI>France:</HI> And the whole Hou&s;e went into this. There were great complaints made of the regiments that the King kept in the <HI>French</HI> army, and of the great &s;ervice that was done by them. It is true, the King &s;uffered the <HI>Dutch</HI> to make le|vies. But there was another &s;ort of encouragement given to the levies for <HI>France,</HI> particularly in <HI>Scotland;</HI> where it looked liker a pre&s;s than a levy. They had not only the publick jails given them to keep their men in: But, when the&s;e were full, they had the ca&s;tle of <HI>Edenburgh</HI> a&s;&s;igned them, till &s;hips were ready for their tran&s;port. Some, that were put in pri&s;on for Conventicles, were, by order of Council, delivered to their officers. The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador heard of this, and made great complaints upon it. So a Proclamation was ordered, prohibiting any more levies. But Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> kept it up &s;ome days, and writ down to ha&s;ten the levies away; for a Pro|clamation was coming down again&s;t them. They were all &s;hipped off, but had not &s;ailed, when the Proclamation came down: Yet it was kept up, till they &s;ailed away. One of the &s;hips was driven back by &s;tre&s;s of weather: But no care was

taken to execute the Proclamation. So apparently was that Kingdom in a <HI>French</HI> management.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons pre&s;&s;ed the King, by repeated ad|dre&s;&s;es, to fall into the intere&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> as well as into his own. The King was unea&s;y at this, and &s;ent them &s;everal an|gry me&s;&s;ages. Peace and war, he &s;aid, were undoubtedly matters within his prerogative, in which they ought not to meddle. And the King in common di&s;cour&s;e remembred often the Parliament's engaging his father and grandfather in the af|fairs of <HI>Germany,</HI> and to break the match with <HI>Spain,</HI> which proved fatal to them: And he re&s;olved not to be &s;erved in &s;uch a manner. Upon this occa&s;ion, Lord <HI>Danby</HI> &s;aw his error, of ne|glecting the leading men, and reckoning upon a majority, &s;uch as could be made: For the&s;e leading men did &s;o entangle the debates, and over-reached tho&s;e on whom he had practi&s;ed, that they, working on the aver&s;ion that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation natu|rally has to a <HI>French</HI> intere&s;t, &s;poiled the hopefulle&s;t Se&s;&s;ion the Court had had of a great while, before the Court was well aware of it. The King, who was yet firmly united with <HI>France,</HI> di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with a very angry &s;peech, checking them for going &s;o far in matters that were above them, and that belonged only to him: Tho' they brought to him ma|ny precedents in the Reigns of the highe&s;t &s;pirited of all our Kings, in which Parliaments had not only offered general ad|vices, about the entring into wars, but even &s;pecial ones, as to the conduct that was to be held in them. The whole Na|tion thought it a great happine&s;s, to &s;ee a Se&s;&s;ion, that Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI>'s willfulne&s;s had, as it were, driven in to the Court, end with doing &s;o little mi&s;chief; far contrary to all mens ex|pectations.</P>
<P>When the Se&s;&s;ion was over, Lord <HI>Danby</HI> &s;aw his ruin was <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Danby</HI> de|clared a|gain&s;t <HI>France</HI></NOTE> inevitable, if he could not bring the King off from a <HI>French</HI> intere&s;t: Upon which he &s;et him&s;elf much to it. And, as he talked with an extraordinary zeal again&s;t <HI>France</HI> on all occa&s;i|ons, &s;o he pre&s;&s;ed the King much to follow the advices of his Parliament. The King &s;eemed to in&s;i&s;t upon this, that he would once have a peace made, upon the grounds that he had concerted with <HI>France:</HI> And, when that was done, he would enter next day into the Alliance. But he &s;tood much upon this; that having once engaged with <HI>France</HI> in the war, he could not with honour turn again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> till it was at an end. This was &s;uch a refining in a point of honour, which that King had not on all other occa&s;ions con&s;idered &s;o much, that all men believed there was &s;omewhat el&s;e at the bottom.
<PB N="408" REF="423">
The Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> continued to give, by Sir <HI>William Temple,</HI> all po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;urances to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> pre&s;&s;ing him likewi&s;e to make &s;ome compliances on his &s;ide. And he gave him great hopes of bringing about a marriage with the Duke's Daughter; which was univer&s;ally de&s;ired by all the Prote&s;tant party, both at home and abroad. Great offers were made to the Duke to draw him into the Alliance. He was offered the command of the whole force of the Allies. And he &s;eemed to be wrought on by the pro&s;pect of &s;o great an authority. There was a party that were &s;till very jealous of Lord <HI>Danby</HI> in all this matter. Some thought, all this was artifice; that a war would be offered to the next Se&s;&s;ion, only to draw mo|ney from the Parliament, and thereby to rai&s;e an army; and that, when the army was rai&s;ed, and much money given to &s;upport it, all would be &s;old to <HI>France</HI> for another great &s;um; and that the Parliament would be brought to give the money to pay an army for &s;ome years, till the Nation &s;hould be &s;ub|dued to an entire compliance with the Court. It was given out, that this mu&s;t be the &s;cheme by which he maintained him&s;elf in the King and the Duke's confidence, even when he declar|ed him&s;elf an open enemy to that which they were &s;till &s;up|porting. This he did with &s;o little decency, that at <HI>Sancroft</HI>'s con&s;ecration dinner, he began a health, to the confu&s;ion of all that were not for a war with <HI>France.</HI> He got the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to a&s;k the King's leave to come over at the end of the campaign: With which the Court of <HI>France</HI> was not plea&s;ed; for they &s;u&s;pected a de&s;ign for the marriage. But the King a&s;&s;ured <HI>Barillon,</HI> who was lately &s;ent over Em|ba&s;&s;ador in <HI>Courtin</HI>'s place, that there was not a thought of that; and that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had only a mind to talk with him: And he hoped, he &s;hould bring him into &s;uch mea&s;ures, as &s;hould produce a &s;peedy peace.</P>
<P>The campaign ended un&s;ucce&s;sfully to the Prince: For he &s;at down before <HI>Charleroy,</HI> but was forced to rai&s;e the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> came into <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> &s;iege. When that was over, he came to <HI>England,</HI> and &s;taid &s;ome time in it, talking with his two uncles about a peace. But they could not bring him up to their terms. After a fruitle&s;s &s;tay for &s;ome weeks, he intended to go back without propo&s;ing marriage. He had no mind to be denied: And he &s;aw no hope of &s;ucceeding, unle&s;s he would enter more entire|ly into his uncle's mea&s;ures. Lord <HI>Danby</HI> pre&s;&s;ed his &s;taying a few days longer, and that the management of that matter might be left to him. So next <HI>Monday</HI> morning, after he had taken care, by all his creatures about the King, to put
<PB N="409" REF="424">
him in a very good humour, he came to the King, and told him, he had received Letters from all the be&s;t friends his Maje&s;ty had in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;hewed a bundle of them; (in which he was pretty &s;ure the King would not trouble him&s;elf to read them; probably they were written as he had directed.) They all agreed, he &s;aid, in the &s;ame advice, that the King &s;hould make a marriage between the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and the Duke's daughter: For they all believed he came over on that account: And, if he went away without it, no body would doubt, but that he had propo&s;ed it, and had been denied. Upon which the Parliament would certainly make addre&s;&s;es to the King for it. And if the marriage was made upon that, the King would lo&s;e the grace and thanks of it: But if it was &s;till denied, even after the addre&s;&s;es of both Hou&s;es, it would rai&s;e jealou&s;ies that might have very ill con&s;equences. Where|as, if the King did it of his own motion, he would have the honour of it: And, by &s;o doing, he would bring the Prince into a greater dependance on him&s;elf, and beget in the Nati|on &s;uch a good opinion of him, as would lay a foundation for a mutual confidence. This he enforced with all the topicks he could think on. The King &s;aid, the Prince had not &s;o much as propo&s;ed it: Lord <HI>Danby</HI> owned he had &s;poke of it to him&s;elf; and &s;aid, that his not moving it to the King was only, becau&s;e he apprehended he was not like to &s;ucceed in it. The King &s;aid next, my brother will never con&s;ent to it. Lord <HI>Danby</HI> an&s;wered, perhaps not, unle&s;s the King took it upon him to command it: And he thought it was the Duke's intere&s;t to have it done, even more than the King's: All people were now po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of his being a Papi&s;t, and were very apprehen&s;ive of it: But if they &s;aw his daughter given to one that was at the head of the Prote&s;tant intere&s;t, it would very much &s;often tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions, when it did appear that his religion was only a per&s;onal thing, not to be derived to his children after him. With all this the King was con|vinced. So he &s;ent for the Duke, Lord <HI>Danby</HI> &s;taying &s;till with him. When the Duke came, the King told him he had &s;ent for him, to de&s;ire he would con&s;ent to a thing that he was &s;ure was as much for his intere&s;t, as it was for his own quiet and &s;atisfaction. The Duke, without a&s;king what it was, &s;aid, he would be ready always to comply with the King's plea&s;ure in every thing. So the King left it to the Lord <HI>Dan|by</HI> to &s;ay over all he had &s;aid on that head to him&s;elf. The Duke &s;eemed much concerned. But the King &s;aid to him; Brother, I de&s;ire it of you for my &s;ake, as well as your own:
<PB N="410" REF="425">
And upon that the Duke con&s;ented to it. So Lord <HI>Danby</HI> &s;ent immediately for the Prince, and in the King's name or|dered a Council to be pre&s;ently &s;ummoned. Upon the Prince's coming, the King, in a very obliging way, &s;aid to him; Ne|phew, it is not good for man to be alone, I will give you a help meet for you: And &s;o he told him he would be&s;tow his niece on him. And the Duke, with a &s;eeming heartine&s;s, gave his con&s;ent in very obliging terms: The King adding, Nephew, remember that love and war do not agree well toge|ther. In the mean while the news of the intended marriage went over the Court and Town. All, except the <HI>French</HI> and the Popi&s;h party, were much plea&s;ed with it. <HI>Barillon</HI> was amaz|ed. He went to the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> and got her to &s;end all her creatures to de&s;ire to &s;peak to the King: She writ him likewi&s;e &s;everal Billets to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. But Lord <NOTE PLACE="marg">He married the Duke's daughter.</NOTE> <HI>Danby</HI> had ordered the Council to be called: And he took care, that neither the King nor the Duke &s;hould be &s;poke to, till the matter was declared in Council. And when that was done, the King pre&s;ented the Prince to the young Lady, as the per&s;on he de&s;igned &s;hould be her hu&s;band. When <HI>Barillon</HI> &s;aw it was gone &s;o far, he &s;ent a courier to the Court of <HI>France</HI> with the news: Upon who&s;e arrival <HI>Mountague,</HI> that was then our Emba&s;&s;ador there, was &s;ent for. When he came to <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> he &s;aw the King the mo&s;t moved, that he had ever ob&s;erved him to be. He a&s;ked him, when was the marriage to be made? <HI>Moun|tague</HI> under&s;tood not what he meant. So he explained all to him. <HI>Mountague</HI> prote&s;ted to him, that he knew nothing of the whole matter. That King &s;aid, he always believed the journey would end in this: And he &s;eemed to think that our Court had now for&s;aken him. He &s;poke of the King's part in it more decently; but expo&s;tulated &s;everely on the Duke's part, who had now given his daughter to the greate&s;t enemy he had in the world. To all this <HI>Mountague</HI> had no an&s;wer to make. But next night he had a courier with letters, from the King, the Duke, and the Prince, to the King of <HI>France.</HI> The Prince had no mind to this piece of court&s;hip: But his uncle obliged him to it, as a civility due to kindred and blood. The King a&s;&s;ured the King of <HI>France,</HI> that he had made the match on de&s;ign to engage the Prince to be more tractable in the treaty, that was now going on at <HI>Nimeguen.</HI> The King of <HI>France</HI> received the&s;e letters civilly; but did not &s;eem much &s;atisfied with them. <HI>Mountague</HI> was called over &s;oon after this, to get new in&s;tructions. And Lord <HI>Danby</HI> a&s;ked him, how the King of <HI>France</HI> received the news of the
<PB N="411" REF="426">
marriage. He an&s;wered, as he would have done the lo&s;s of an army; and that he had &s;poke very hardly of the Duke, for con&s;enting to it, and not at lea&s;t acquainting him with it. Lord <HI>Danby</HI> an&s;wered, he wronged him; for he did not know of it an hour before it was publi&s;hed, and the King him&s;elf not above two hours. All this relation I had from <HI>Mountague</HI> him&s;elf. It was a ma&s;ter-piece indeed, and the chief thing in the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI>'s mini&s;try, for which the Duke never forgave him.</P>
<P>Upon the general &s;atisfaction that this marriage gave the <NOTE PLACE="marg">1678</NOTE> whole Nation, a new &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament was called in the beginning of the year 78: To which the King declared the &s;en&s;e he had of the dangerous &s;tate their neighbours were in, and that it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be put in a po&s;ture to bring things to a balance. So the Hou&s;e was pre&s;&s;ed to &s;upply the King in &s;o plentiful a manner, as the occa&s;ion did require. The Court a&s;ked money, both for an army, and a fleet. Sir <HI>William Coventry</HI> &s;hewed the great inconvenience of rai&s;ing a land army, the danger that might follow on it, the little u&s;e could be made of it, and the great charge it mu&s;t put the Na|tion to: He was for hiring bodies from the <HI>German</HI> Princes, and for a&s;&s;i&s;ting the <HI>Dutch</HI> with money: And he moved to re|cal our troops from <HI>France,</HI> and to employ them in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Service: He thought, that which did more properly belong to <HI>England,</HI> was to &s;et out a great fleet, and to cut off the <HI>French</HI> trade every where; for they were then very high in their manufactures and trade; their people were ingenious as well as indu&s;trious; they wrought hard, and lived low; &s;o they &s;old cheaper than others could do; and it was found, that we &s;ent very near a million of our money in &s;pecie every year for the balance of our trade with them. But the King had promi&s;ed &s;o many Commi&s;&s;ions to men of quality in both Hou&s;es, that this carried it for a land army. It was &s;aid, what hazard could there be from an army commanded by men of e&s;tates, as this was to be? A &s;evere act pa&s;s'd prohibiting all importation of the <HI>French</HI> manufactures or growth for three years, and to the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament after that. This was made as &s;trict as was po&s;&s;ible: And for a year after it was well look'd to. But the merchants found ways to evade it: And the Court was too much <HI>French,</HI> not to connive at the breach of it. In the preamble of this Act it was &s;et forth, that we were in an actual war with <HI>France.</HI> This was excepted to, as not true in fact. But the Mini&s;try affirmed we were already engaged &s;o far with the Allies, that it was really a war, and
<PB N="412" REF="427">
that our troops were already called from <HI>France. Coventry</HI> in &s;ome heat &s;aid, the King was engaged, and he would rather be guilty of the murder of forty men, than to do any thing to retard the progre&s;s of the war. The oddne&s;s of the expre&s;|&s;ion made it to be often objected afterwards to him. A poll bill was granted, together with the continuance of the addi|tional cu&s;toms, that were near falling off. Six hundred thou|&s;and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Supplies gi|ven towards the war.</NOTE> pound was al&s;o given for a land army, and for a fleet. All the Court party magnified the de&s;ign of rai&s;ing an army. They &s;aid, the employing hired troops was neither honourable nor &s;afe. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> were willing to put <HI>O&s;tend</HI> and <HI>New|port</HI> in our hands: And we could not be an&s;werable for the&s;e places, if they were not kept by our own people.</P>
<P>At this time the King of <HI>France</HI> made a &s;tep that &s;truck <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>French</HI> take <HI>Ghent.</HI></NOTE> terror into the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and enflamed the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> out of mea|&s;ure. <HI>Louvoy</HI> till then was rather his father's a&s;&s;i&s;tant, than a mini&s;ter upon his own foot. He at this time gained the credit with the King, which he maintained &s;o long afterwards. He propo&s;ed to him the taking of <HI>Ghent;</HI> and thought that the King's getting into &s;uch a place, &s;o near the <HI>Dutch,</HI> would immediately di&s;po&s;e them to a peace. But it was not ea&s;y to bring their army &s;o &s;oon about it, without being ob&s;erved: So the execution &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible. He therefore laid &s;uch a &s;cheme of marches and countermarches, as did amu&s;e all the Allies. Sometimes the de&s;ign &s;eemed to be on the <HI>Rhine:</HI> Sometimes on <HI>Luxemburgh.</HI> And while their forces were &s;ent to defend tho&s;e places, where they apprehended the de&s;ign was Iaid, and that none of the <HI>French</HI> Generals them&s;elves did ap|prehend what the true de&s;ign was, all on the &s;udden <HI>Ghent</HI> was inve&s;ted: And both town and citadel were quickly taken. This was <HI>Louvoy</HI>'s ma&s;ter-piece. And it had the intended effect. It brought the <HI>Dutch</HI> to re&s;olve on a peace. The <HI>French</HI> King might have taken <HI>Bruges, O&s;tend</HI> and <HI>Newport.</HI> But he only took <HI>Ypres;</HI> for he had no mind to provoke the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> He was &s;ure of his point by the fright this put the <HI>Dutch</HI> in. We were much alarmed at it. And the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was immediately &s;ent over with &s;ome of the Guards.</P>
<P>But the Parliament grew jealous, as they had great cau&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">The affairs of <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> given them, both by what was then doing in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and by the management they ob&s;erved at Court. And now I mu&s;t look Northward to a very extraordinary &s;cene that open|ed there. Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> and his Duche&s;s went to <HI>Scotland</HI> the former year. Her de&s;ign was to marry her Daughters in|to two of the great Families of <HI>Scotland, Argile</HI> and <HI>Murray,</HI>
<PB N="413" REF="428">
which &s;he did. But, things being then in great di&s;order, by rea&s;on of the numbers and de&s;perate tempers of tho&s;e who were in|tercommoned, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mitchell</HI>'s trial.</NOTE> <HI>Sharp</HI> pretended, he was in great danger of his life; and that the rather, becau&s;e the per&s;on that had made the attempt on him was let live &s;till. Upon this I mu&s;t tell what had pa&s;t three years before this. <HI>Sharp</HI> had ob&s;erved a man that kept &s;hop at his door, who look'd very narrowly at him always as he pa&s;s'd by: And he fancied, he was the man that had &s;hot at him &s;ix years before. So he ordered him to be taken up, and examined. It was found, he had two pi&s;tols by him, that were deeply charged, which encrea&s;ed the &s;u&s;picion. Yet the man denied all. But <HI>Sharp</HI> got a friend of his to go to him, and deal with him to make a full confe&s;&s;ion: And he made &s;olemn promi&s;es, that he would procure his pardon. His friend an&s;wered, he hoped he did not intend to make u&s;e of him to trepan a man to his ruin. Upon that, with lifted up hands, <HI>Sharp</HI> promi&s;ed by the living God, that no hurt &s;hould come to him, if he made a full di&s;covery. The per&s;on came again to him, and &s;aid, if a promi&s;e was made in the King's name, the pri&s;oner would tell all. So it was brought before the Council. Lord <HI>Rothes, Halton,</HI> and <HI>Primero&s;e</HI> were ordered to examine him. <HI>Primero&s;e</HI> &s;aid, it would be a &s;trange force of eloquence, to per&s;uade a man to confe&s;s, and be hanged. So Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> being the King's Commi&s;&s;ioner, gave them power to promi&s;e him his life. And as &s;oon as the&s;e Lords told him this, he immediately kneeled down, and con|fe&s;&s;ed the fact, and told the whole manner of it. There was but one per&s;on privy to it, who was then dead. <HI>Sharp</HI> was troubled to &s;ee &s;o &s;mall a di&s;covery made: Yet they could not draw more from him. So then it was con&s;idered, what &s;hould be done to him. Some moved the cutting off his right hand. Others &s;aid, he might learn to practi&s;e with his left hand, and to take his revenge; therefore they thought both hands &s;hould be cut off. Lord <HI>Rothes,</HI> who was a plea&s;ant man, &s;aid, how &s;hall he wipe his breech then. This is not very decent to be mentioned in &s;uch a work, if it were not nece&s;&s;ary; for when the truth of the promi&s;e now given was afterwards called in que&s;tion, this je&s;t was called to mind, and made the whole matter to be remembred. But <HI>Primero&s;e</HI> mov|ed, that &s;ince life was promi&s;ed, which the cutting off a limb might endanger, it was better to keep him pri&s;oner during life in a ca&s;tle they had in the <HI>Ba&s;s,</HI> a rock in the mouth of the <HI>Frith:</HI> And thither he was &s;ent. But it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to make him repeat his confe&s;&s;ion in a Court of Judicature: So he was brought into the Ju&s;titiary Court, upon an inditement
<PB N="414" REF="429">
for the crime, to which it was expected he &s;hould plead guilty. But the Judge, who hated <HI>Sharp,</HI> as he went up to the bench, pa&s;&s;ing by the pri&s;oner &s;aid to him, Confe&s;s nothing, unle&s;s you are &s;ure of your limbs as well as of your life. Upon this hint he, apprehending the danger, refu&s;ed to confe&s;s: Which being reported to the Council, an act was pa&s;t mentioning the pro|mi&s;e and his confe&s;&s;ion, and adding, that &s;ince he had retracted his confe&s;&s;ion, they likewi&s;e recalled the promi&s;e of pardon: The meaning of which was this, that, if any other evidence was brought again&s;t him, the promi&s;e &s;hould not cover him: But it &s;till was under&s;tood, that this promi&s;e &s;ecured him from any ill effect by his own confe&s;&s;ion. The thing was almo&s;t forgot after four years, the man being in all re&s;pects very incon&s;ider|able. But now <HI>Sharp</HI> would have his life. So Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> gave way to it: And he was brought to <HI>Edenburgh</HI> in order to his trial. <HI>Nisbit,</HI> who had been the King's Advocate, and was one of the worthie&s;t and learnede&s;t men of the age, was turned out. And <HI>Mackenzie</HI> was put in his place, who was a man of much life and wit, but he was neither equal nor correct in it: He has publi&s;hed many books, &s;ome of law, but all full of faults; for he was a &s;light and &s;uperficial man. <HI>Lockhart</HI> was a&s;&s;igned coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner. And now that the matter came again into peoples memory, all were amazed at the proceeding. <HI>Prime|ro&s;e</HI> was turned out of the place of Lord Regi&s;ter, and was made Ju&s;tice General. He fancied orders had been given to raze the Act that the Council had made: So he turned the books, and he found the Act &s;till on record. He took a copy of it, and &s;ent it to <HI>Mitchell</HI>'s Coun&s;el: That was the pri&s;oner's name. And, a day or two before the trial, he went to Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> who, together with <HI>Sharp,</HI> Lord <HI>Rothes,</HI> and Lord <HI>Halton,</HI> were &s;ummoned as the pri&s;oner's witne&s;&s;es. He told him, many thought there had been a promi&s;e of life given. Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> denied it &s;tiffly. <HI>Primero&s;e</HI> &s;aid, he heard there was an Act of Council made about it, and he wi&s;hed that might be looked into. Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> &s;aid, he was &s;ure it was not po&s;&s;ible, and he would not give him&s;elf the trouble to turn over the books of Council. <HI>Primero&s;e,</HI> who told me this, &s;aid his con&s;cience led him to give Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> this warning of the matter, but that he was not &s;orry to &s;ee him thus re|ject it. The trial was very &s;olemn. The confe&s;&s;ion was brought again&s;t him, as full evidence: To which <HI>Lockhart</HI> did plead, to the admiration of all, to &s;hew that no extrajudicial confe&s;|&s;ion could be allowed in a Court. The hard&s;hips of a pri&s;on, the hopes of life, with other practices, might draw confe&s;&s;ions from men, when they were perhaps drunk, or out of their
<PB N="415" REF="430">
&s;en&s;es. He brought upon this a mea&s;ure of learning, that a|mazed the audience, out of the lawyers of all civilized Nati|ons. And, when it was oppo&s;ed to this, that the Council was a Court of Judicature, he &s;hewed, that it was not the proper Court for crimes of this nature, and that it had not proceeded in this as a Court of Judicature. And he brought out likewi&s;e a great deal of learning upon tho&s;e heads. But this was over|ruled by the Court, and the confe&s;&s;ion was found to be judicial. The next thing pleaded for him was, that it was drawn from him upon hope and promi&s;e of life: And to this <HI>Sharp</HI> was examined. The per&s;on he had &s;ent to <HI>Mitchell</HI> gave a full evi|dence of the promi&s;es he had made him: But <HI>Sharp</HI> denied them all. He al&s;o denied he heard any promi&s;e of life made him by the Council: So did the Lords <HI>Lauderdale, Rothes,</HI> and <HI>Halton,</HI> to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all that were pre&s;ent. <HI>Lockhart</HI> upon that produced a copy of the Act of Council, that made expre&s;s mention of the promi&s;e given, and of his having con|fe&s;&s;ed upon that. And the pri&s;oner prayed that the books of Council, which lay in a room over that in which the Court &s;at, might be &s;ent for. <HI>Lockhart</HI> pleaded, that &s;ince the Court had judged that the Council was a Judicature, all peo|ple had a right to &s;earch into their regi&s;ters; and the pri|&s;oner, who was like to &s;uffer by a confe&s;&s;ion made there, ought to have the benefit of tho&s;e books. Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> who was in the Court only as a witne&s;s, and &s;o had no right to &s;peak, &s;tood up, and &s;aid, he and tho&s;e other noble per&s;ons were not brought thither to be accu&s;ed of perjury; and added, that the books of Council were the King's &s;ecrets, and that no Court &s;hould have the peru&s;ing of them. The Court was terrified with this, and the Judges were divided in opinion. <HI>Primero&s;e,</HI> and one other, was for calling for the books. But three were of opinion, that they were not to furni&s;h the pri&s;oner with evi|dence, but to judge of that which he brought. And here was only a bare copy, not atte&s;ted upon oath, which ought not to have been read. So, this defence being rejected, he was ca&s;t and condemned.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Court broke up, the Lords went up &s;tairs, <NOTE PLACE="marg">And con|demnation.</NOTE> and to their &s;hame found the Act recorded, and &s;igned by Lord <HI>Rothes,</HI> as Pre&s;ident of the Council. He pretended, he &s;igned every thing that the clerk of Council put in the book without reading it. And it was intended to throw it on him. But he, to clear him&s;elf, &s;earched among his papers, and found a draught of the Act in <HI>Nisbit</HI>'s hand. So, he being rich, and one they had turned out, they re&s;olved to put it upon him, and to fine him deeply. But he examined the <HI>Sederunt</HI> in the
<PB N="416" REF="431">
book, and &s;poke to all who were there at the board, of whom nine happened to be in Town, who were ready to depo&s;e up|on oath, that when the Council had ordered this Act to be drawn, the clerk of the Council de&s;ired the help of the King's Advocate in penning it, which he gave him; and his draught was approved by the Council. And now Lord <HI>Rothes</HI>'s je&s;t was re|membred. Yet Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> &s;till &s;tood to it, that the pro|mi&s;e could only be for interceeding with the King for his par|don, &s;ince the Council had not the power of pardoning in them. Lord <HI>Kincardin</HI> acted in this the part of a Chri&s;tian to an enemy. Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> had writ to him, he being then &s;erving for him at Court, that he referred the account of <HI>Mit|chell</HI>'s bu&s;ine&s;s to his brother's letters; in which the matter was truly related, that upon promi&s;e of life he had confe&s;&s;ed the fact; and he concluded, de&s;iring him to a&s;k the King, that he would be plea&s;ed to make good the promi&s;e. The&s;e letters I &s;aw in Lord <HI>Kincardin</HI>'s hand. Before the trial he &s;ent a Bi|&s;hop to Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> de&s;iring him to con&s;ider better of that matter, before he would upon oath deny it: For he was &s;ure he had it under his, and his brother's hand, tho' he could not yet fall upon their letters. But Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> de&s;pi&s;ed this. Yet, before the execution he went to his hou&s;e in the countrey, and there found the letters, and brought them in with him, and &s;hewed them to that Bi&s;hop. All this made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on Duke <HI>Lauderdale:</HI> And he was willing to grant a reprieve, and to refer the matter to the King. So a petition was offered to the Council: And he &s;poke for it. But <HI>Sharp</HI> &s;aid, that was upon the matter the expo&s;ing his per&s;on to any man that would attempt to murder him, &s;ince favour was to be &s;hewed to &s;uch an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. Then &s;aid Duke <HI>Lauder|dale,</HI> in an impious je&s;t, Let <HI>Mitchell</HI> glorify God in the gra&s;s market, which was the place where he was to be hanged. This action, and all concern'd in it, were look'd at by all people with horror. And it was &s;uch a complication of treachery, per|jury, and cruelty, as the like had not perhaps been known. Yet Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> had a Chaplain, <HI>Hickes,</HI> afterwards Dean of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> who publi&s;hed a fal&s;e and partial relation of this matter, in order to the ju&s;tifying of it. <HI>Primero&s;e</HI> not only gave me an account of this matter, but &s;ent me an authentick re|cord of the trial, every page &s;igned by the clerk of the Court; of which I have here given an ab&s;tract. This I &s;et down the more fully, to let my readers &s;ee to what a height in wickedne&s;s men may be carried, after they have once thrown off good princi|ples. What <HI>Sharp</HI> did now to pre&s;erve him&s;elf from &s;uch prac|tices was probably that which, both in the ju&s;t judgment of God,
<PB N="417" REF="432">
and the enflamed fury of wicked men, brought him two years after to &s;uch a di&s;mal end.</P>
<P>This made way to more de&s;perate undertakings. Conven|ticles grew in the We&s;t to a very un&s;ufferable pitch: They had generally with them a troop of armed and de&s;perate men, that drew up, and &s;ent parties out to &s;ecure them. Duke <HI>Lau|derdale</HI> upon this threatned he would extirpate them, and ruin the whole countrey, if a &s;top was not put to tho&s;e meetings. The chief men of tho&s;e parts upon that went into <HI>Edenburgh:</HI> They offered to guard and a&s;&s;i&s;t any that &s;hould be &s;ent to exe|cute the laws again&s;t all offenders; and offered to leave &s;ome as Ho&s;tages, who &s;hould be bound body for body for their &s;e|curity: They confe&s;&s;ed there were many Conventicles held a|mong them in a mo&s;t &s;candalous manner: But, tho' they met in the fields, and many of them were armed, yet, when their &s;ermons were done, they di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves: And there was no violent oppo&s;ition made at any time to the execution of the law: So, they &s;aid, there was no danger of the publick peace of the countrey. Tho&s;e conventicling people were become very giddy and furious: And &s;ome hot and hair-brained young preachers had the chief following among them, who infu&s;ed wild principles in them, which were di&s;owned by the chief men of the party. The truth was, the countrey was in a great di|&s;traction: And that was chiefly occa&s;ioned by the &s;trange ad|mini&s;tration they were then under. Many grew weary of their <NOTE PLACE="marg">The admi|ni&s;tration there grew very violent and illegal.</NOTE> countrey, and even of their lives. If Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> or any of his party, brought a complaint again&s;t any of the other &s;ide, how fal&s;e or frivolous &s;oever, they were &s;ummoned upon it to appear before the Council, as &s;owers of &s;edition, and as men that &s;pread lies of the Government: And upon the &s;lighte&s;t pretences they were fined and impri&s;oned. When very illegal things were to be done, the common method was this: A let|ter was drawn for it to be &s;igned by the King, directing it up|on &s;ome colour of law or ancient practice: The King &s;igned what&s;oever was thus &s;ent to him: And when his letter was read in Council, if any of the lawyers or others of the board offered to object to it, he was brow-beaten, as a man that oppo&s;|ed the King's &s;ervice, and refu&s;ed to obey his orders. And by the&s;e means things were driven to great extremities.</P>
<P>Upon one of tho&s;e letters, a new motion was &s;et on foot, that went beyond all that had been yet made. All the land|lords in the We&s;tern Counties were required to enter into bonds for them&s;elves, their wives, children, &s;ervants, tenants, and all that lived upon their e&s;tates, that they &s;hould not go to Conventicles, nor harbour any vagrant teachers, or any Inter|communed
<PB N="418" REF="433">
per&s;ons; and that they &s;hould live in all points ac|cording to law under the penalties of the laws. This was ge|nerally refu&s;ed by them: They &s;aid, the law did not impo&s;e it on them: They could not be an&s;werable for their &s;ervants, much le&s;s for their tenants: This put it in the power of every &s;ervant or tenant to ruin them. Upon their refu&s;ing this, Duke <HI>Landerdale</HI> writ to the King, that the countrey was in a &s;tate of rebellion, and that it was nece&s;&s;ary to proceed to ho&s;tilities for reducing them. So by a letter, &s;uch as he &s;ent up, the King left it to him and the Council to take care of the publick peace in the be&s;t way they could.</P>
<P>Upon this all the force the King had was &s;ent into the we&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">An army of Highlanders &s;ent to the We&s;t upon free quarter.</NOTE> countrey, with &s;ome cannon, as if it had been for &s;ome dange|rous expedition: And letters were writ to the Lords in the Highlands, to &s;end all the &s;trength they could to a&s;&s;i&s;t the King's army. The Marqui&s;s of <HI>Athol,</HI> to &s;hew his great|ne&s;s, &s;ent 2400 men. The Earl of <HI>Braidalbin</HI> &s;ent 1700. And, in all, 8000 men were brought into the countrey, and let loo&s;e upon free quarter. A Committee of Council was &s;ent to give nece&s;&s;ary orders. Here was an Army. But no enemy ap|peared. The Highlanders were very unruly, and &s;tole, and robbed every where. The gentlemen of the countrey were re|quired to deliver up their arms upon oath, and to keep no hor&s;e above four pound price. The gentlemen looked on, and would do nothing. This put Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> in &s;uch a frenzy, that at Council table he made bare his arms above his elbow, and &s;wore by <HI>Jehovah</HI> he would make them enter into tho&s;e bonds. Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and others, who were vexed to &s;ee &s;uch wa&s;te made on their e&s;tates, in plowing time e&s;peci|ally, came to <HI>Edenburgh</HI> to try if it was po&s;&s;ible to mollify him. But a Proclamation was i&s;&s;ued out, requiring all the inhabitants of tho&s;e Counties to go to their hou&s;es, to be a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the King's ho&s;t, and to obey &s;uch orders as &s;hould be &s;ent them. And by another Proclamation all men were forbidden to go out of the Kingdom without leave from the Council, on pretence that their &s;tay was nece&s;&s;ary for the King's &s;ervice. The&s;e things &s;eemed done on de&s;ign to force a rebellion; which they thought would be &s;oon qua&s;h'd, and would give a good colour for keep|ing up an army. And Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s party depended &s;o much on this, that they began to divide in their hopes the confi&s;cated e&s;tates among them: So that on <HI>Valentine</HI>'s day, in&s;tead of drawing mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, they drew e&s;tates. And great joy appeared in their looks upon a fal&s;e alarm that was brought them of an in&s;urrection: And they were as much detected, when they knew it was fal&s;e. It was happy for the publick peace,
<PB N="419" REF="434">
that the people were univer&s;ally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with this opinion: For when they &s;aw a rebellion was de&s;ired, they bore the pre|&s;ent oppre&s;&s;ion more quietly, than perhaps they would have done, if it had not been for that. All the chief men of the countrey were &s;ummoned before the Committee of Council, and charged with a great many crimes, of which they were required to purge them&s;elves by oath: Otherwi&s;e they would hold them guilty, and proceed again&s;t them as &s;uch. It was in vain to pretend, that this was again&s;t all law, and was the practice only of the Courts of Inqui&s;ition. Yet the gentlemen, being thus forced to it, did purge them&s;elves by oath. And, after all the enquiries that were made, there did not appear one &s;ingle circum&s;tance to prove that any rebellion was intended. And, when all other things failed &s;o evidently, recour&s;e was had to a writ, which a man who &s;u&s;pects another of ill de&s;igns to|wards him may &s;erve him with: And it was called Law-Bor|roughs, as mo&s;t u&s;ed in Borroughs. This lay again&s;t a whole family: The ma&s;ter was an&s;werable, if any one of his hou&s;hold broke it. So, by a new practice, this writ was &s;erved upon the whole countrey at the King's &s;uit: And, upon &s;erving the writ, &s;ecurity was to be given, much like the binding men to their good behaviour. Many were put in pri&s;on for refu&s;ing to give this &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> had intimation &s;ent him, that it was de&s;ign|ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> to &s;erve this on him. So he, and ten or twelve of the No|bility, with about 50 gentlemen of quality, came up to com|plain of all this; which looked like <HI>French,</HI> or rather like <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> government. The Lords of <HI>Athol</HI> and <HI>Perth,</HI> who had been two of the Committee of Council, and had now fallen off from Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> came up with them to give the King an ac|count of the whole progre&s;s of this matter. The clamour this made was &s;o high, that Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> &s;aw he could not &s;tand under it. So the Highlanders were &s;ent home, after they had wa&s;ted the countrey near two months. And he magnified this as an act of his compa&s;&s;ion, that they were &s;o &s;oon di&s;mi&s;t. Indeed all his own party were again&s;t him in it. Lord <HI>Argile</HI> &s;ent none of his men down with the other Highlanders. And Lord <HI>Stairs</HI> pretended that by a fall his hand was out of joint: So he &s;igned none of the&s;e wild orders.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Nobility came to <HI>London,</HI> the King would <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> not &s;ee them, becau&s;e they were come out of the Kingdom in contempt of a Proclamation; tho' they &s;aid, that Proclama|tion, being intended to hinder them from bringing their com|plaints to the King, was one of their greate&s;t grievances.
<PB N="420" REF="435">
But it was an&s;wered, they ought ought to have a&s;ked leave: And, if it had been denied them, they were next to have a&s;ked the King's leave: And the King in&s;i&s;ted &s;till on this. Only he &s;aw the Lords of <HI>Athol</HI> and <HI>Perth.</HI> The madne&s;s of this proceeding made him conclude, that Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s head was turned. Yet he would not di&s;own, much le&s;s puni&s;h him for what he had done. But he intended to put <HI>Scotland</HI> in another management, and to &s;et the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> at the head of it. So he &s;uffered him to go to the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Lords, and be their interce&s;&s;or with him. They were all much charmed with the &s;oftne&s;s of his temper and behaviour. But, tho' he a&s;&s;ured them the King would put their affairs in other hands, they looked on that as one of the King's artifices to get rid of them. The matter made great noi&s;e: And it was in the time of the &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament here. And all people &s;aid, that by the management in <HI>Scotland</HI> it appear|ed what was the &s;pirit of the Government; and what would be done here, as &s;oon as the de&s;igns of the Court were brought to a greater perfection. The Earl of <HI>Danby,</HI> by &s;upporting Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> heightned the prejudices that him&s;elf lay under. The Duke did al&s;o ju&s;tify his conduct; which rai&s;ed higher jealou&s;ies of him, as being plea&s;ed with that method of government. The chief of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Nobility were heard be|fore the Cabinet-Council. And the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> held them chiefly to the point of coming out of the Kingdom in the face of a Proclamation. They &s;aid, &s;uch Proclamations were anciently legal, when we had a King of our own among our &s;elves: But now it was manife&s;tly again&s;t law, &s;ince it bar|red them from acce&s;s to the King, which was a right that was never to be denied them. Lord <HI>Nottingham</HI> objected next to them a practice of making the heads of the families or clans in the Highlands to bind for their whole name; and why by a parity of rea&s;on might they not be required to bind for their tenants? It was an&s;wered, that anciently e&s;tates were let &s;o low, that &s;ervice and the following the landlords was in&s;tead of a rent; and then, in the inroads that were made into <HI>England,</HI> landlords were required to bring their tenants along with them: But now lands were let at rack: And &s;o an end was put to that &s;ervice: In the Highlands the feuds among the families were &s;till &s;o high, that every name came under &s;uch a dependance on the head or chief of it for their own &s;ecurity, that he was re|ally the ma&s;ter of them all, and &s;o might be bound for them: But even this was only to re&s;train depredations and murthers: And it was an unheard of &s;tretch, to oblige men to be bound for others in matters of Religion and Con&s;cience, whether real or pretended.</P>
<P><PB N="421" REF="436">
The whole matter was at that time let fall. And Duke <HI>Lau|derdale</HI> took advantage from their ab&s;ence to de&s;ire leave from the <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> King to &s;ummon a Convention of E&s;tates; from whom he might more certainly under&s;tand the &s;en&s;e of the whole Kingdom. And, what by corrupting the Nobility, what by carrying elections, or at lea&s;t di&s;putes about them, which would be judged as the ma|jority &s;hould happen to be at fir&s;t, he hoped to carry his point. So he i&s;&s;ued out the writs, while they were at <HI>London,</HI> knowing nothing of the de&s;ign. And the&s;e being returnable in three weeks, he laid the matter &s;o, that before they could get home, all the elections were over: And he was ma&s;ter of above four parts in five of that A&s;&s;embly. So they granted an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment for three years, in order to the maintaining a greater force. And they wrote a letter to the King, not only ju&s;tifying, but highly mag|nifying Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s government. This was &s;o ba&s;e and &s;o abject a thing, that it brought the whole Nation under great contempt.</P>
<P>And thus I leave the affairs of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which had a very ill <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> influence on the minds of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> chiefly on the Hou&s;e of Commons then &s;itting, who upon it made a new addre&s;s again&s;t Duke <HI>Lauderdale.</HI> And that was followed by another of a higher &s;train, repre&s;enting to the King the ill effects of his not harkning to their addre&s;s the former year with relation to foreign affairs; and de&s;iring him to change his Mini&s;try, and to di&s;mi&s;s all tho&s;e that had advi&s;ed the prorogation at that time, and his delaying &s;o long to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Allies. This was carried only by a &s;mall majo|rity of two or three. So Lord <HI>Danby</HI> brought up all his creatures, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hou&s;e of $word$ $word$ grew jealous of the Court</NOTE> the aged and infirm not excepted: And then the majority lay the other way: And by &s;hort adjournments the Parliament was kept &s;itting till <HI>Mid&s;ummer.</HI> Once Lord <HI>Danby,</HI> thinking he had a clear majority, got the King to &s;end a me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e, de&s;iring an additional Revenue of 300000 <HI>l.</HI> during life. This &s;et the Hou&s;e all in a flame. It was &s;aid, here was no demand for a war, but for a revenue, which would furni&s;h the Court &s;o well, that there would be no more need of Parliaments. The Court party thought &s;uch a gift as this would make them u&s;ele&s;s. So the thing was upon one debate rejected without a divi&s;ion. Lord <HI>Danby</HI> was much cen&s;ured for this ra&s;h attempt, which di&s;covered the de&s;igns of the Court too barefacedly. At the &s;ame time he or|dered <HI>Mountagne</HI> to treat with the Court of <HI>France</HI> for a peace, in ca&s;e they would engage to pay the King 300000 <HI>l.</HI> a year for three years. So, when that came afterwards to be known, it was then generally believed, that the de&s;ign was to keep up and mo|del the army now rai&s;ed, reckoning there would be money enough to pay them till the Nation &s;hould be brought under a military go|vernment.
<PB N="422" REF="437">
And the opinion of this prevailed &s;o, that Lord <HI>Danby</HI> became the mo&s;t hated Mini&s;ter that had ever been about the King. All people &s;aid now, they &s;aw the &s;ecret of that high favour he had been &s;o long in, and the black de&s;igns that he was contriving. At this time expre&s;&s;es went very quick between <HI>En|gland</HI> and <HI>France:</HI> And the &s;tate of foreign affairs varied every po&s;t. So that it was vi&s;ible we were in a &s;ecret negotiation: Of which <HI>Temple</HI> has given &s;o particular an account, that I refer my reader wholly to him. But I &s;hall add one particular, that he has not mentioned: <HI>Mountague,</HI> who was a man of plea&s;ure, was in an intrigue with the Duche&s;s of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> who was quite ca&s;t off by the King, and was then at <HI>Paris.</HI> The King had ordered him to find out an a&s;trologer, of whom it was no wonder he had a good opinion; for he had, long before his Re&s;toration, fore|told he &s;hould enter <HI>London</HI> on the <HI>29^t^h</HI> of <HI>May</HI> 60. He was yet alive, and <HI>Mountague</HI> found him; And &s;aw he was capable of being corrupted. So he re&s;olved to prompt him, to &s;end the King &s;uch hints as &s;hould &s;erve his own ends. And he was &s;o bewitched with the Duche&s;s of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> that he tru&s;ted her with this &s;ecret. But &s;he, growing jealous of a new amour, took all the ways &s;he could think on to ruin him, re&s;erving this of the a&s;trologer for her la&s;t &s;hift. And by it &s;he compa&s;&s;ed her ends: For <HI>Mountague</HI> was en|tirely lo&s;t upon it with the King, and came over without being recalled. The Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI> was &s;ent Emba&s;&s;ador in his room.</P>
<P>The treaty went on at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> where <HI>Temple</HI> and <HI>Jenkins</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs a|broad.</NOTE> were our Plenipotentiaries. The States were re&s;olved to have a peace. The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> did all he could to hinder it. But <HI>De Wit</HI>'s party began to gather &s;trength again. And they infu&s;ed a jealou&s;y in all people, that the Prince intended to keep up the war for his own ends. A peace might be now had by re&s;toring all that belonged to the States, and by a tolerable barrier in <HI>Flanders.</HI> It is true, the great difficulty was concerning their al|lies, the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh;</HI> who had fallen on the <HI>Swede,</HI> upon the King's declaring for <HI>France,</HI> and had beat him out of <HI>Germany.</HI> No peace could be had, unle&s;s the <HI>Swede</HI> was re&s;tored. Tho&s;e Princes, who had been quite exhau&s;ted by that war, would not con&s;ent to this. So they, who had adhered &s;o faithfully to the States in their extre|mity, pre&s;&s;ed them to &s;tick by them. And this was the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s con&s;tant topick: How could they expect any of their allies &s;hould &s;tick to them, if they now for&s;ook &s;uch faithful friends? But nothing could prevail. It was given out in <HI>Holland,</HI> that they could not depend on <HI>England,</HI> that Court being &s;o en|tirely in a <HI>French</HI> intere&s;t, that they &s;u&s;pected they would, as they had
<PB N="423" REF="438">
once done, &s;ell them again to the <HI>French.</HI> And this was believed to be let out by the <HI>French</HI> mini&s;ters them&s;elves, who, to come at their ends, were apt enough to give up even tho&s;e who &s;acrificed every thing to them. It was &s;aid, the Court of <HI>France</HI> would con&s;ider both <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and repay the charge of the war again&s;t <HI>Sweden.</HI> This, it was &s;aid, was to force tho&s;e Princes into a dependance on <HI>France,</HI> who would not continue tho&s;e payments &s;o much for pa&s;t as for future &s;ervices. In the mean while the <HI>French</HI> had block'd up <HI>Mons.</HI> So the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> went to force them from their po&s;ts. <HI>Luxemburgh</HI> commanded there, and &s;eemed to be in full hope of a peace, when the Prince came and attack'd him. And, notwith&s;tanding the advantage of his &s;ituation, it appeared how much the <HI>Dutch</HI> army was now &s;uperior to the <HI>French,</HI> for they beat them out of &s;everal po&s;ts. The Prince had no order to &s;top. He indeed knew that the peace was upon the matter concluded. But no in|timation was yet made to him. So it was lawful for him to take all advantages. And he was not apprehen&s;ive of a new embroil|ment, but rather wi&s;h'd it. The <HI>French</HI> trea&s;ure was &s;o exhau&s;ted, and their King was &s;o weary of the war, that no notice was tak|en of the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Mons.</HI> The treaty at <HI>Nimeguen</HI> was fini&s;h|ed, and ratified. Yet new difficulties aro&s;e, upon the <HI>French</HI> King's refu&s;ing to evacuate the places that were to be re&s;tored till the <HI>Swede</HI> was re&s;tored to all his dominions. Upon this the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> &s;truck in again: And the King talked &s;o high, as if he would engage anew in the war. But the <HI>French</HI> prevented that, and did evacuate the places. And then they got <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Bran|denburgh</HI> into their dependance, under the pretence of repaying the charge of the war. But it was more truly, the engaging them into the intere&s;ts of <HI>France</HI> by great pen&s;ions. So a general peace quickly followed. And there was no more occa&s;ion for our troops beyond &s;ea. The <HI>French</HI> were &s;o apprehen&s;ive of them, that <HI>Ron|vigny,</HI> now Earl of <HI>Gallway,</HI> was &s;ent over to negotiate matters. That which <HI>France</HI> in&s;i&s;ted mo&s;t on, was the di&s;banding the ar|my. And the force of money was &s;o &s;trong, that he had orders to offer &s;ix millions of their money, in ca&s;e the army &s;hould be di&s;banded in <HI>Augu&s;t. Rouvigny</HI> had &s;uch an ill opinion of the de|&s;igns of our Court, if the army was kept up, that he in&s;i&s;ted on fixing the day for di&s;banding it; at which the Duke was very un|ea&s;y. And matters were &s;o managed, that the army was not di&s;|banded by the day prefixed for it. So the King of <HI>France</HI> &s;av'd his money. And for this piece of good management <HI>Rouvigny</HI> was much commended. The troops were brought into <HI>England,</HI> and kept up, under the pretence that there was not money to pay them off. So all people look'd on the next &s;e&s;&s;ion as very critical.
<PB N="424" REF="439">
The party again&s;t the Court gave all for lo&s;t. They believed the Lord <HI>Danby,</HI> who had &s;o often brought his party to be very near the majority, would now lay matters &s;o well as to be &s;ure to carry the Se&s;&s;ion. And many did &s;o de&s;pair of being able to balance his numbers, that they re&s;olved to come up no more, and reck|oned that all oppo&s;ition would be fruitle&s;s, and &s;erve only to ex|po&s;e them&s;elves to the fury of the Court. But of a &s;udden an unlooked for accident changed all their mea&s;ures, and put the Kingdom into &s;o great a fermentation, that it well de&s;erves to be opened very particularly. I am &s;o well in&s;tructed in all the &s;teps of it, that I am more capable to give a full account of it than any man I know. And I will do it &s;o impartially, that no party &s;hall have cau&s;e to cen&s;ure me for concealing, or altering the truth in any one in&s;tance. It is the Hi&s;tory of that called the Popi&s;h Plot.</P>
<P>Three days before <HI>Michaelmas</HI> Dr. <HI>Tonge</HI> came to me. I had <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> known him at Sir <HI>Robert Murray</HI>'s. He was a gardiner and a chy|mi&s;t, and was full of projects and notions. He had got &s;ome credit in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s time: And that kept him poor. He was a very mean Divine, and &s;eemed credulous and &s;imple. But I had always look'd on him as a &s;incere man. At this time he told me of &s;trange de&s;igns again&s;t the King's per&s;on; and that <HI>Coniers,</HI> a <HI>Benedictin,</HI> had provided him&s;elf of a poniard, with which he undertook to kill him. I was amazed at all this; and did not know whether he was crazed, or had come to me on de&s;ign to involve me in a conceal|ing of trea&s;on. So I went to Dr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> and &s;ent him to the Se|cretary's office with an account of that di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Tonge</HI>'s, &s;ince I would not be guilty of mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on. He found at the office, that <HI>Tonge</HI> was making di&s;coveries there; of which they made no other account, but that he intended to get him&s;elf to be made a Dean. I told this next morning to <HI>Littleton</HI> and <HI>Powel.</HI> And they looked on it as a de&s;ign of Lord <HI>Danby</HI>'s, to be laid before the $$xt Se&s;&s;ion, thereby to di&s;po&s;e them to keep up a $$$ater $word$, &s;ince the Papi&s;ts were plotting again&s;t the King's $word$. Th$$ $word$ put an end to all jealou&s;ies of the King, now $span$piring again&s;t his life. But Lord <HI>Hallifax,</HI> $span$ of it, had another apprehen&s;ion of it. He &s;aid, $span$ &s;u&s;picions all people had of the Duke's Religion, $span$ every di&s;covery of that &s;ort would rai&s;e a flame, $span$ would not be able to manage.</P>
<P>$span$ that <HI>Titus Oates</HI> was brought before the Council. <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> $span$ of an Anabapti&s;t teacher, who afterwards con|$word$, $span$ $$to orders, and took a benefice, as this his &s;on $word$. $span$ and ill natured, haughty, but ignorant. He h$d been co$span$ned of for &s;ome very indecent expre&s;&s;ions con|cerning
<PB N="425" REF="440">
the my&s;teries of the Chri&s;tian Religion. He was once pre&s;ented for perjury. But he got to be a Chaplain in one of the King's &s;hips, from which he was di&s;mi&s;s'd upon complaint of &s;ome unnatural practices, not to be named. He got a qualification from the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> as one of his Chaplains: And there he fell into much di&s;cour&s;e with the Prie&s;ts that were about that fa|mily. He &s;eemed inclined to be in&s;tructed in the Popi&s;h Religi|on. One <HI>Hutchin&s;on,</HI> a Je&s;uit, had that work put on him. He was a weak and light-headed man, and afterwards came over to the Church of <HI>England. Hutchin&s;on</HI> was a Curate about the City near a year, and came oft to me, and preached once for me. He &s;eemed to be a &s;incere devout man, who did not at all love the Order, for he found they were a deceitful and med|dling &s;ort of people. They never tru&s;ted him with any &s;ecrets, but employed him wholly in making converts. He went after|wards back to that Church. So all this was thought a juggle only to ca&s;t an odium upon <HI>Oates.</HI> He told me, that <HI>Oates</HI> and they were always in ill terms. They did not allow <HI>Oates</HI> above nine pence a day, of which he complained much. And <HI>Hutchin|&s;on</HI> relieved him often. They wi&s;hed they could be well rid of him; and &s;ent him beyond &s;ea, being in very ill terms with him. This made <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI> conclude, that they had not at that time tru&s;ted <HI>Oates</HI> with their &s;ecrets. <HI>Oates</HI> was kept for &s;ome time at St. <HI>Omers;</HI> and from thence &s;ent thro' <HI>France</HI> into <HI>Spain;</HI> and was now returned into <HI>England.</HI> He had been long acquainted with <HI>Tonge;</HI> and made his fir&s;t di&s;covery to him. And he, by the means of one <HI>Kirby,</HI> a Chymi&s;t, that was &s;ometimes in the King's laboratory, &s;ignified the thing to the King. So <HI>Tonge</HI> had an audience; and told the King a long thread of many pa&s;&s;ages, all tending to the taking away his life; which the King, as he afterwards told me, knew not what to make of: Yet among &s;o many particulars he did not know but there might be &s;ome truth. So he &s;ent him to Lord <HI>Danby,</HI> who intended to make &s;ome u&s;e of it, but could not give much credit to it, and handled the matter too remi&s;&s;ly: For, if at fir&s;t the thing had been traced quick, either the truth or the impo&s;ture of the whole affair might have been made appear. The King ordered Lord <HI>Danby</HI> to &s;ay nothing of it to the Duke. In the mean while &s;ome letters of an odd &s;train, relating to plots and di&s;coveries, were &s;ent by the po&s;t to <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> directed to <HI>Beddingfield,</HI> the Duke's Confe&s;&s;or; who, when he had read them, carried them to the Duke, and prote&s;ted he did not know what they meant, nor from whom they came. The Duke carried them to the King. And he fancied they were writ either by <HI>Tonge</HI> or <HI>Oates,</HI> and &s;ent on de&s;ign to have them intercepted, to give the more credit to the di&s;covery. The Duke's enemies on the other hand gave out, that he had got &s;ome hints of the di&s;|covery,
<PB N="426" REF="441">
and brought the&s;e as a blind to impo&s;e on the King. The matter lay in a &s;ecret and remi&s;s management for &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, on <HI>Michaelmas</HI> Eve, <HI>Oates</HI> was brought before the Council; and entertained them with a long relation of many di&s;|cour&s;es <NOTE PLACE="marg">His di&s;co|very.</NOTE> he had heard among the Je&s;uites, of their de&s;ign to kill the King. He named per&s;ons, places, and times, almo&s;t with|out number. He &s;aid, many Je&s;uites had di&s;gui&s;ed them&s;elves, and were gone to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and held Field-Conventicles, on de|&s;ign to di&s;tract the Government there. He &s;aid, he was &s;ent fir&s;t to St. <HI>Omers,</HI> thence to <HI>Paris,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Spain,</HI> to ne|gotiate this de&s;ign; and that upon his return, when he brought many letters and directions from beyond &s;ea, there was a great meeting of the Je&s;uites held in <HI>London,</HI> in <HI>April</HI> la&s;t, in different rooms in a tavern near St. <HI>Clements;</HI> and that he was employed to convey the re&s;olutions of tho&s;e in one room to tho&s;e in another, and &s;o to hand them round. The i&s;&s;ue of the con&s;ultation was, that they came to a re&s;olution to kill the King by &s;hooting, &s;tab|ing, or poi&s;oning him; that &s;everal attempts were made, all which failed in the execution, as &s;hall be told when the trials are related. While he was going on, waiting for &s;ome certain evi|dence to accompany his di&s;covery, he perceived they were jea|lous of him: And &s;o he dur&s;t not tru&s;t him&s;elf among them any more. In all this there was not a word of <HI>Coniers,</HI> of whom <HI>Tonge</HI> had &s;poke to me. So that was dropt. This was the &s;ub|&s;tance of what <HI>Oates</HI> told the fir&s;t day. Many Je&s;uites were upon this &s;eized on that night, and the next day. And their Papers were &s;ealed up next day. He accu&s;ed <HI>Coleman</HI> of a &s;trict corre&s;pon|dence with <HI>P. de la Chai&s;e;</HI> (who&s;e name he had not right, for he called him <HI>Father Le Shee:)</HI> And he &s;aid in general, that <HI>Cole|man</HI> was acquainted with all their de&s;igns.</P>
<P><HI>Coleman</HI> had a whole day free to make his e&s;cape, if he thought he was in any danger. And he had conveyed all his papers out <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coleman</HI> and his papers $word$</NOTE> of the way: Only he forgot a drawer under the table, in which the papers relating to 74, 75, and a part of 76 were left. And from the&s;e I drew the negotiations, that I have formerly mentioned as directed by him. If he had either left all his pa|pers, or withdrawn all, it had been happy for his party. No|thing had appeared, if all his papers had been put out of the way. $word$, if all had been left, it might have been concluded, that the whole &s;ecret lay in them. But he left enough to give great jea|lou&s;y. And, no more appearing, all was believed that the wit|ne&s;&s;es had depo&s;ed. <HI>Coleman</HI> went out of the way for a day, hearing that there was a warrant out again&s;t him. But he delivered him&s;elf the next day to the Secretary of State. When <HI>Oates</HI> and he were confronted, <HI>Oates</HI> did not know him at fir&s;t: But he named him, when he heard him &s;peak. Yet he only charged
<PB N="427" REF="442">
him upon hear-&s;ay. So he was put in a me&s;&s;enger's hands. <HI>Oates</HI> named <HI>Wakeman,</HI> the Queen's phy&s;ician; but did not know him at all. And being a&s;ked, if he knew any thing again&s;t him, he an&s;wered he did not; adding, God forbid, he &s;hould &s;ay any thing more than he knew, he would not do that for all the world. Nor did he name <HI>Langhorn</HI> the famous Lawyer, that indeed managed all their concerns. The King found him out in one thing. He &s;aid, when he was in <HI>Spain,</HI> he was carried to <HI>Don John,</HI> who promi&s;ed great a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the execution of their de&s;igns. The King, who knew <HI>Don John</HI> well, a&s;ked him what a &s;ort of man he was: He an&s;wered, he was a tall lean man: Now <HI>Don John</HI> was a little fat man. At fir&s;t he &s;eemed to de&s;ign to recommend him&s;elf to the Duke and the Mini&s;ters: For he &s;aid, he heard the Je&s;uites oft &s;ay, that the Duke was not &s;ure enough to them: And they were in doubt, whether he would approve of their killing the King: But they were re&s;olved, if they found him &s;tiff in that matter, to di&s;patch him likewi&s;e. He &s;aid, they had oft made u&s;e of his name, and counterfeited his hand and &s;eal, without his knowledge. He &s;aid, the Je&s;uites cheri&s;hed the faction in <HI>Scotland</HI> again&s;t Duke <HI>Lauderdale;</HI> and intended to murder the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> as a great enemy to all their de|&s;igns. And he affirmed, he had &s;een many letters, in which the&s;e things were mentioned, and had heard them oft &s;poke of. He gave a long account of the burning of <HI>London,</HI> at which they in|tended to have killed the King: But they relented, when they &s;aw him &s;o active in quenching the fire, which, as he &s;aid, they had kindled.</P>
<P>The whole town was all over enflamed with this di&s;covery. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coleman</HI>'s letters con|firm it.</NOTE> It con&s;i&s;ted of &s;o many particulars, that it was thought to be above invention. But when <HI>Coleman</HI>'s letters came to be read and examined, it got a great confirmation; &s;ince by the&s;e it appear|ed, that &s;o many years before they thought the de&s;ign for the converting the Nation, and rooting out the pe&s;tilent here&s;y that had reigned &s;o long in the&s;e northern Kingdoms, was very near its being executed: Mention was oft made of the Duke's great zeal for it: And many indecent reflections were made on the King, for his incon&s;tancy, and his di&s;po&s;ition to be brought to any thing for money: They depended on the <HI>French</HI> King's a&s;|&s;i&s;tance: And therefore were earne&s;t in their endeavours to bring about a general peace, as that which mu&s;t fini&s;h their de&s;ign.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd day after this di&s;covery, the King went to <HI>Newmarket.</HI> This was cen&s;ured, as a very indecent levity in him, to go and &s;ee hor&s;e-races, when all people were &s;o much po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed with this extraordinary di&s;covery, to which <HI>Coleman</HI>'s let|ters had gained an univer&s;al credit. While the King was gone, <HI>Tonge</HI> de&s;ired to &s;peak with me. So I went to him to <HI>Whitehall,</HI>
<PB N="428" REF="443">
where both he and <HI>Oates</HI> were lodged under a guard. I found him &s;o lifted up, that he &s;eemed to have lo&s;t the little &s;en&s;e he had. <HI>Oates</HI> came in; and made me a complement, that I was one that was mark'd out to be kill'd. He had before &s;aid the &s;ame to <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> of him. But he made that honour he which did us too cheap, when he &s;aid <HI>Tonge</HI> was to be &s;erved in the &s;ame man|ner, becau&s;e he had tran&s;lated the Je&s;uites morals in to <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> He broke out into great fury again&s;t the Je&s;uites; and &s;aid, he would have their blood. But I, to divert him from that &s;train, a&s;ked him, what were the arguments that prevailed on him to change his Religion, and to go over to the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> He upon that &s;tood up, and laid his hands on his brea&s;t; and &s;aid, God and his holy Angels knew, that he had never changed, but that he had gone among them on purpo&s;e to betray them. This gave me &s;uch a character of him, that I could have no re|gard to any thing he either &s;aid or &s;wore after that.</P>
<P>A few days after this, a very extraordinary thing happened, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Godfrey</HI> is murthered.</NOTE> that contributed more than any other thing to the e&s;tabli&s;hing the belief of all this evidence. Sir <HI>Edmondbury Godfrey</HI> was an eminent Ju&s;tice of Peace, that lived near <HI>Whitehall.</HI> He had the courage to &s;tay in <HI>London,</HI> and keep things in order during the plague; which gained him much reputation, and upon which he was Knighted. He was e&s;teemed the be&s;t Ju&s;tice of Peace in <HI>En|gland;</HI> and kept the Quarter where he lived in very good order. He was then entring upon a great de&s;ign of taking up all beg|gars and putting them to work. He was thought vain, and apt to take too much upon him. But there are &s;o few men of a publick &s;pirit, that &s;mall faults, tho' they lo&s;&s;en them, yet ought to be gently cen&s;ured. I knew him well, and never had rea&s;on to think him faulty that way. He was a zealous Prote&s;tant, and loved the Church of <HI>England;</HI> but had kind thoughts of the Nonconfor|mi&s;ts, and was not forward to execute the laws again&s;t them. And he, to avoid being put on doing that, was not apt to &s;earch for Prie&s;ts or Ma&s;s-hou&s;es. So that few men of his zeal lived in better terms with the Papi&s;ts than he did. <HI>Oates</HI> went to him the day before he appeared at the Council board; and made oath of the narrative he intended to make, which he afterwards publi&s;h|ed. This &s;eemed to be done in di&s;tru&s;t of the Privy Council, as if they might &s;tifle his evidence; which to prevent he put it in &s;afe hands. Upon that <HI>Godfrey</HI> was chid for his pre&s;uming to meddle in &s;o tender a matter. And it was generally believed, that <HI>Coleman</HI> and he were long in a private conver&s;ation, be|tween the time of his <HI>(Coleman</HI>'s) being put in the me&s;&s;enger's hands, and his being made a clo&s;e pri&s;oner: Which was done as &s;oon as report was made to the Council of the contents of his
<PB N="429" REF="444">
letters. It is certain, <HI>Godfrey</HI> grew apprehen&s;ive and re&s;erved: For meeting me in the &s;treet, after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs, he &s;aid, he believed he him&s;elf &s;hould be knock|ed on the head. Yet he took no care of him&s;elf, and went a|bout according to his own maxim, &s;till without a &s;ervant: For he u&s;ed to &s;ay, that the &s;ervants in <HI>London</HI> were corrupted by the idlene&s;s and ill company they fell into, while they attended on their ma&s;ters. On the day fortnight from that in which <HI>Oates</HI> had made his di&s;covery, being <HI>Saturday,</HI> he went abroad in the mor|ning, and was &s;een about one a clock near St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s Church; but was never &s;een any more. He was a punctual man to good hours: So his &s;ervants were amazed when he did not come home. Yet, he having an ancient mother that lived at <HI>Hamer&s;mith,</HI> they fancied, he had heard &s;he was dying, and &s;o was gone to &s;ee her. Next morning they &s;ent thither, but heard no news of him. So his two brothers, who lived in the City, were &s;ent to. They were not acquainted with his affairs: So they did not know whether he might not have &s;tept a&s;ide for debt; &s;ince at that time all people were calling in their money, which broke a great many. But, no creditors coming about the hou&s;e, they on <HI>Tue&s;|day</HI> publi&s;hed his being thus lo&s;t. The Council &s;ate upon it, and were going to order a &s;earch of all the hou&s;es about the town; but were diverted from it, by many &s;tories that were brought them by the Duke of <HI>Norfolk.</HI> Sometimes it was &s;aid, he was in|decently married: And the &s;cene was often &s;hifted of the places where it was &s;aid he was. The Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI>'s officiou&s;ne&s;s in this matter, and the la&s;t place he was &s;een at, being near <HI>Arundel</HI> hou&s;e, brought him under great &s;u&s;picion. On <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> one came into a Book&s;eller's &s;hop after dinner, and &s;aid, he was found thru&s;t thro' with a &s;word. That was pre&s;ently brought as news to me: But the reporter of it was not known. That night <NOTE PLACE="marg">His body was found.</NOTE> late his body was found in a ditch, about a mile out of the town, near St. <HI>Pancras</HI> Church. His &s;word was thru&s;t thro' him. But no blood was on his clothes, or about him. His &s;hoes were clean. His money was in his pocket. But nothing was about his neck. And a mark was all round it, an inch broad, which &s;hewed he was &s;trangled. His brea&s;t was likewi&s;e all over marked with brui&s;es: And his neck was broken. All this I &s;aw; for Dr. <HI>Lloyd</HI> and I went to view his body. There were many drops of white wax-lights on his breeches, which he never u&s;ed him&s;elf. And &s;ince only per&s;ons of quality, or Prie&s;ts, u&s;e tho&s;e lights, this made all people conclude in who&s;e hands he mu&s;t have been. And it was vi&s;ible he was fir&s;t &s;trangled, and then carried to that place, where his &s;word was run thro' his dead body. For a while it was given out, that he was a hypocondriacal man, and had kill|ed
<PB N="430" REF="445">
him&s;elf. Of this the King was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, till Dr. <HI>Lloyd</HI> went and told him what he had &s;een. The body lay two days expo&s;ed, many going to &s;ee it, who went away much moved with the &s;ight. And indeed mens &s;pirits were &s;o &s;harpned upon it, that we all looked on it as a very great happine&s;s, that the people did not vent their fury upon the Papi&s;ts about the town.</P>
<P>The Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament was to be opened within three days: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oates</HI> made a new di&s;|covery.</NOTE> And it may be ea&s;ily imagined in what a temper they met. The Court party were out of countenance. So the Country party were ma&s;ters this &s;e&s;&s;ion. All <HI>Oates</HI>'s evidence was now &s;o well believ|ed, that it was not &s;afe for any man to &s;eem to doubt of any part of it. He thought he had the Nation in his hands, and was &s;welled up to a high pitch of vanity and in&s;olence. And now he made a new edition of his di&s;covery at the bar of the Hou&s;e of Commons. He &s;aid, the Pope had declared that <HI>England</HI> was his Kingdom, and that he had &s;ent over commi&s;&s;ions to &s;everal per&s;ons: And had by the&s;e made Lord <HI>Arundel</HI> of <HI>Wardour</HI> Chancellor, Lord <HI>Powis</HI> Trea&s;urer, Sir <HI>William Godolphin,</HI> then in <HI>Spain,</HI> Privy Seal, <HI>Coleman</HI> Secretary of State, <HI>Bella&s;is</HI> General, <HI>Petre</HI> Lieutenant General, <HI>Rateli&s;&s;e</HI> Major General, <HI>Stafford</HI> Payma&s;ter General, and <HI>Langhorn</HI> Advocate General; be&s;ides many other commi&s;&s;ions for &s;ubaltern officers. The&s;e, he &s;aid, he &s;aw in <HI>Langhorn</HI>'s chamber; and that he had delivered out many of them him&s;elf, and &s;aw many more delivered by others. And he now &s;wore, upon his own know|ledge, that both <HI>Coleman</HI> and <HI>Wakeman</HI> were in the plot; that <HI>Coleman</HI> had given eighty Guineas to four ruffians, that went to <HI>Wind|&s;or</HI> la&s;t &s;ummer, to &s;tab the King; that <HI>Wakeman</HI> had undertaken to poi&s;on him, for which 10000 <HI>l.</HI> was offered him, but that he got the price rai&s;ed to 15000 <HI>l.</HI> He excu&s;ed his not knowing them, when confronted with them; and &s;aid, that he was then &s;o &s;pent by a long examination, and by not &s;leeping for two nights, that he was not then ma&s;ter of him&s;elf; tho' it &s;eemed very &s;trange, that he &s;hould then have forgot that which he made now the main part of his evidence, and &s;hould have then objected only reports upon hear|&s;ay, when he had &s;uch matter again&s;t them, as he now &s;aid, up|on his own knowledge. And it &s;eemed not very congruous, that tho&s;e who went to &s;tab the King had but twenty guineas apiece, when <HI>Wakeman</HI> was to have 15000 <HI>l.</HI> for a &s;afer way of killing him. Many other things in the di&s;covery made it &s;eem ill di|ge&s;ted, and not credible. <HI>Bella&s;is</HI> was almo&s;t perpetually ill of the gout. <HI>Petre</HI> was a weak man, and had never any military command. <HI>Rateli&s;&s;e</HI> was a man that lived in great &s;tate in the North, and had not &s;tirred from home all the la&s;t &s;ummer. <HI>Oates</HI> al&s;o &s;wore, he delivered a commi&s;&s;ion to be a Collonel, in <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, to <HI>Howard,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Carlile</HI>'s brother, that had mar|ried
<PB N="431" REF="446">
the Duche&s;s of <HI>Richmond.</HI> But a friend of mine told me, he was all that month at <HI>Bath,</HI> lodged in the &s;ame hou&s;e with <HI>Howard,</HI> with whom he was every day engaged at play. He was then mi&s;erably ill of the gout, of which he died &s;oon after. <HI>Oates</HI> did al&s;o charge General <HI>Lambert,</HI> as one engaged in the de&s;ign, who was to have a great po&s;t, when &s;et at liberty. But he had been kept in pri&s;on ever &s;ince the Re&s;toration; and by that time had lo&s;t his memory and &s;en&s;e. But it was thought &s;trange, that &s;ince <HI>Oates</HI> had &s;o often &s;aid, what I once heard him &s;ay, that he had gone in among them on de&s;ign to betray them, that he had not kept any one of all the&s;e commi&s;&s;ions to be real proof in &s;upport of his evidence. He had al&s;o &s;aid to the King, that whereas others ventured their lives to &s;erve him, he had ventured his &s;oul to &s;erve him: And yet he did &s;uffer the four ruffians to go to <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> to kill him, without giving him any notice of his danger. The&s;e were characters &s;trong enough to give &s;u&s;picion, if <HI>Coleman</HI>'s letters, and <HI>Godfrey</HI>'s murder, had not &s;eemed &s;uch authentick confirmations, as left no room to doubt of any thing. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> indeed told me, that <HI>Langhorn</HI>'s wife, who was &s;till as zealous a Prote&s;tant as he was a Papi&s;t, came oft to him, and gave him notice of every thing &s;he could di&s;cover among them; tho's &s;he continued a faithful and dutiful wife to the la&s;t minute of her hu&s;band's life. Upon the fir&s;t breaking out of the plot, before <HI>Oates</HI> had &s;poke a word of commi&s;&s;ions, or had accu&s;ed <HI>Langhorn,</HI> &s;he engaged her &s;on into &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e upon tho&s;e matters, who was a hot indi&s;creet Papi&s;t. He &s;aid, their de|&s;igns were &s;o well laid, it was impo&s;&s;ible they could mi&s;carry: And that his father would be one of the greate&s;t men of <HI>England;</HI> for he had &s;een a commi&s;&s;ion from the Pope, con&s;tituting him Advocate General. This he told me in <HI>Stilling fleet</HI>'s hearing.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> had got out of the Tower in the for|mer Se&s;&s;ion, upon his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to which it was not ea&s;y to bring him. But when he &s;aw an army rai&s;ed, he had no mind to lie longer in pri&s;on. The matter bore a long debate, the mo|tion he had made in the King's bench being urged much again&s;t him. But a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion always takes off a contempt. So he got out. And now the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and he, with the Lords <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Hallifax,</HI> were the governing men among the Lords. Many hard things were &s;aid again&s;t the Duke. Yet when they tried to carry an Addre&s;s to be made to the King to &s;end him away from Court, the majority was again&s;t them.</P>
<P>While things were thus in a ferment at <HI>London, Bedlow</HI> deli|vered <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> him&s;elf to the magi&s;trates of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> pretending he knew the &s;ecret of <HI>Godfrey</HI>'s murder. So he was &s;ent up to <HI>London.</HI> The King told me, that when the Secretary examined him in
<PB N="432" REF="447">
his pre&s;ence, at his fir&s;t coming he &s;aid he knew nothing of the plot; but that he had heard that 40000 men were to come over from <HI>Spain,</HI> who were to meet as pilgrims at St. <HI>Jago</HI>'s, and were to be &s;hip'd for <HI>England:</HI> But he knew nothing of any fleet that was to bring them over. So this was looked on as very extrava|gant. But he &s;aid, he had &s;een <HI>Godfrey</HI>'s body at <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> hou&s;e; and that he was offered 4000 <HI>l,</HI> by a &s;ervant of the Lord <HI>Bella&s;is,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t in carrying it away: But upon that he had gone out of town to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> where he was &s;o pur&s;ued with horror, that it forced him to di&s;cover it. <HI>Bedlow</HI> had led a very vitious life. He had gone by many fal&s;e names, by which he had cheated many per&s;ons. He had gone over many parts of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> as a man of quality. And he had made a &s;hift to live on his wits, or rather by his cheats. So a tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience did not &s;eem to be that to which he was much &s;ubject. But the very next day after this, when he was brought to the bar of the Hou&s;e of Lords, he made a full di&s;covery of his knowledge of the plot, and of the Lords in the tower: For all tho&s;e again&s;t whom <HI>Oates</HI> had informed were now pri&s;oners. The King was upon this convinced, that &s;ome had been with <HI>Bedlow</HI> after he had been before him, who had in&s;tructed him in this narration, of which he had &s;aid the night before that he knew nothing: And yet he not only confirmed the main parts of <HI>Oates</HI>'s di&s;coveries, but added a great deal to them. And he now pre|tended, that his rambling over &s;o many places of <HI>Europe</HI> was all in order to the carrying on this de&s;ign; that he was tru&s;ted with the &s;ecret, and had opened many of the letters, which he was employed to carry.</P>
<P>Here were now two witne&s;&s;es to prove the plot, as far as &s;wear|ing <NOTE PLACE="marg">Otherproofs that &s;eemed to &s;upport the di&s;co|very.</NOTE> could prove it. And among the papers of the Je&s;uites, that were &s;eized on when they were clapt up, two letters were found that &s;eemed to confirm all. One from <HI>Rome</HI> mentioned the &s;ending over the patents; of which it was &s;aid in the letter, that they gue&s;&s;ed the contents, tho' their patrons there carried their matters &s;o &s;ecretly, that nothing was known, but as they thought fit. The Je&s;uites, when examined upon this, &s;aid, the&s;e were on|ly patents with relation to the offices in their order. Another letter was writ to a Je&s;uite in the countrey, citing him to come to <HI>London</HI> by the 24th of <HI>April;</HI> which was the day in which <HI>Oates</HI> &s;wore they held their con&s;ult, and that fifty of them had &s;igned the re&s;olution of killing the King, which was to be executed by <HI>Grove</HI> and <HI>Pickering.</HI> In the end of that letter it was added, I need not enjoin &s;ecrecy, for the nature of the thing requires it. When the Je&s;uite was examined to this, he &s;aid, it was a &s;ummons for a meeting according to the rule of their order: And they
<PB N="433" REF="448">
being to mee$ during the &s;itting of the Parliament, that was the particular rea&s;on for enjoining &s;ecrecy. Yet, while mens minds were &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, the&s;e an&s;wers did not &s;atisfy, but were thought only &s;hifts.</P>
<P>At this time <HI>Car&s;tairs,</HI> of who&s;e behaviour in <HI>Scotland</HI> mention <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Car&s;tair</HI>'s practices.</NOTE> has been made, not having met with tho&s;e rewards that he ex|pected, came up to <HI>London,</HI> to accu&s;e Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> as de|&s;igning to keep up the oppo&s;ition that was made to the laws in <HI>Scotland,</HI> even at the time that he &s;eemed to pro&s;ecute Conventi|cles with the greate&s;t fury; becau&s;e he had often drawn the chief of their teachers into &s;uch &s;nares, that upon the adverti&s;ements that he gave they might have been taken, but that Duke <HI>Lau|derdale</HI> had neglected it: So he &s;aw, he had a mind that Con|venticles &s;hould go on, at the &s;ame time that he was putting the countrey in &s;uch a flame to puni&s;h them. This he undertook to prove, by tho&s;e witne&s;&s;es of whom on other occa&s;ions he had made u&s;e. He al&s;o confe&s;&s;ed the fal&s;e date of that warrant upon which <HI>Baillie</HI> had been cen&s;ured. He put all this in writing, and gave it to the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Athol;</HI> and pre&s;&s;ed him to carry him to Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Kincardin,</HI> that he might beg their pardon, and be a&s;&s;ured of their favour. I was again&s;t the making u&s;e of &s;o vile a man, and would have nothing to do with him. He made application to Lord <HI>Cavendi&s;h,</HI> and to &s;ome of the Hou&s;e of Commons, to whom I gave &s;uch a character of him, that they would &s;ee him no more.</P>
<P>While he was thus looking about where he could find a lucky <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Staley</HI>'s $word$.</NOTE> piece of villany, he happened to go into an eating hou&s;e in <HI>Co|vent</HI> garden, that was over again&s;t the &s;hop of one <HI>Staley,</HI> the Popi&s;h Banker, who had been in great credit, but was then under &s;ome difficulties; for all his creditors came to call for their money. <HI>Staley</HI> happening to be in the next room to <HI>Car&s;tairs, Car&s;tairs</HI> pretended he heard him &s;ay in <HI>French,</HI> that the King was a rogue, and per&s;ecuted the people of God; and that he him&s;elf would &s;tab him, if no body el&s;e would. The words were writ down, which he re&s;olved to &s;wear again&s;t him. So next morning he and one of his witne&s;&s;es went to him, and told him what they would &s;wear again&s;t him, and a&s;ked a &s;um of money of him. He was in much anxiety, and &s;aw great danger on both hands. Yet he cho&s;e rather to leave him&s;elf to their malice, than be prey'd on by them. So he was &s;eiz'd on: And they &s;wore the words again&s;t him: And he was appointed to be tried within five days. When I heard who the witne&s;&s;es were, I thought I was bound to do what I could to &s;top it. So I &s;ent both to the Lord Chancellor, and to the At|torney General, to let them know what profligate wretches the&s;e witne&s;&s;es were. <HI>Jones,</HI> the Attorney General, took it ill of me,
<PB N="434" REF="449">
that I &s;hould di&s;parage the King's evidence. The thing grew publick, and rai&s;ed great clamour again&s;t me. It was &s;aid, I was taking this method to get into favour at Court. I had likewi&s;e ob&s;erved to &s;everal per&s;ons of weight, how many incredible things there were in the evidence that was given: I wi&s;hed they would make u&s;e of the heat the Nation was in to &s;ecure us effec|tually from Popery: We &s;aw certain evidence to carry us &s;o far, as to graft that upon it: But I wi&s;hed they would not run too ha&s;tily to the taking mens lives upon &s;uch te&s;timonies. Lord <HI>Hollis</HI> had more temper, than I expected from a man of his heat. Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> was of the &s;ame mind. But the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> could not bear the di&s;cour&s;e. He &s;aid, we mu&s;t &s;upport the evidence; and that all tho&s;e who undermined the credit of the witne&s;&s;es were to be look'd on as publick enemies. And &s;o incon&s;tant a thing is popularity, that I was mo&s;t bitterly railed at by tho&s;e who &s;eemed formerly to put &s;ome confidence in me. It went &s;o far, that I was advi&s;ed not to &s;tir abroad for fear of publick affronts. But the&s;e things did not daunt me. <HI>Staley</HI> was brought to his trial, which did not hold long. The witne&s;&s;es gave a full evi|dence again&s;t him: And he had nothing to offer to take away their credit. He only &s;hewed how improbable it was, that in a publick hou&s;e he &s;hould talk &s;uch things with &s;o loud a voice as to be heard in the next room, in a quarter of the town where almo&s;t every body under&s;tood <HI>French.</HI> He was ca&s;t: And he pre|pared him&s;elf very &s;eriou&s;ly for death. Dr. <HI>Lloyd</HI> went to &s;ee him in pri&s;on. He was offered his life, if he would di&s;cover their plots. He prote&s;ted, he knew of none; and that he had not &s;aid the words &s;worn again&s;t him, nor any thing to that pur|po&s;e. And he died the fir&s;t of tho&s;e who &s;uffered on the account of the plot. Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> having heard how I had moved in this matter, railed at me with open mouth. He &s;aid, I had &s;tudied to &s;ave <HI>Staley,</HI> for the liking I had to any one that would murder the King. And he infu&s;ed this into the King, &s;o that he repeated it in the Hou&s;e of Lords to a company that were &s;tanding about him.</P>
<P>Yet &s;o &s;oon could the King turn to make u&s;e of a man whom he had cen&s;ured &s;o unmercifully, that two days after this he &s;ent the Earl of <HI>Dunbarton,</HI> that was a Papi&s;t, and had been bred in <HI>France,</HI> and was Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s brother, to me, to de&s;ire me to come to him &s;ecretly, for he had a mind to talk with me. He &s;aid, he be|lieved I could do him &s;ervice, if I had a mind to it. And the See of <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> being then void, he &s;aid, he would not di&s;po&s;e of it, till he &s;aw whether I would de&s;erve it, or not. I a&s;ked, if he fancied I would be a &s;py, or betray any body to him. But he undertook to me, that the King &s;hould a&s;k me no que&s;tion, but &s;hould in all points leave me to my liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="435" REF="450">
An accident fell in, before I went to him, which took off much from <HI>Oates</HI>'s credit. When he was examined by the Hou&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen was charg|ed as in the plot.</NOTE> of Lords, and had made the &s;ame narrative to them that he had offered to the Commons, they a&s;ked him, if he had now named all the per&s;ons whom he knew to be involved in the plot? He &s;aid, there might be &s;ome inferior per&s;ons whom he had perhaps for|got, but he had named all the per&s;ons of note. Yet, it &s;eems, afterwards he bethought him&s;elf: And Mrs. <HI>Elliot,</HI> wife to <HI>Elliot</HI> of the bedchamber, came to the King, and told him, <HI>Oates</HI> had &s;omewhat to &s;wear again&s;t the Queen, if he would give way to it. The King was willing to give <HI>Oates</HI> line enough, as he expre&s;&s;ed it to me, and &s;eemed to give way to it. So he came out with a new &s;tory, that the Queen had &s;ent for &s;ome Je&s;uites to <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> hou&s;e; and that he went along with them, but &s;taid at the door, when they went in; where he heard one, in a woman's voice, expre&s;&s;ing her re&s;entments of the u&s;age &s;he had met with, and a&s;&s;uring them &s;he would a&s;&s;i&s;t them in taking off the King: Upon that he was brought in, and pre&s;ented to her: And there was then no other woman in the room but &s;he. When he was bid de&s;cribe the room, it proved to be one of the publick rooms of that Court, which are &s;o great, that the Queen, who was a woman of a low voice, could not be heard over it, unle&s;s &s;he had &s;trained for it. <HI>Oates,</HI> to excu&s;e his &s;aying that he could not lay any thing to the charge of any be&s;ides tho&s;e he had already nam|ed, pretended, that he thought then it was not lawful to accu&s;e the Queen. But this did not &s;atisfy people. <HI>Bedlow,</HI> to &s;upport this, &s;wore, that being once at chapel at <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> hou&s;e, he &s;aw the Queen, the Duke, and &s;ome others very earne&s;t in di&s;cour&s;e in the clo&s;et above; and that one came down with much joy, and &s;aid, the Queen had yielded at la&s;t; and that one explained this to him beyond &s;ea, and &s;aid, it was to kill the King. And, be&s;ides <HI>Bedlow</HI>'s oath that he &s;aw <HI>Godfrey</HI>'s body in <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> hou&s;e, it was remembred, that at that time the Queen was for &s;ome days in &s;o clo&s;e a retirement, that no per&s;on was admitted. Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> came then to wait on her, but was denied acce&s;s. This rai&s;ed a &s;trange &s;u&s;picion of her. But the King would not &s;uffer that matter to go any farther.</P>
<P>While examinations were going on, and preparation was mak|ing <NOTE PLACE="marg">A law pa&s;t for the $word$ to be taken by both Hou&s;es.</NOTE> for the trial of the pri&s;oners, a bill was brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons, requiring all members of either Hou&s;e, and all &s;uch as might come into the King's Court, or pre&s;ence, to take a te&s;t again&s;t Popery; in which, not only Tran&s;ub&s;tantiati|on was renounced, but the wor&s;hip of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and the Saints, as it was practi&s;ed in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> was declar|ed to be idolatrous. This pa&s;&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Commons
<PB N="436" REF="451">
without any difficulty. But in the Hou&s;e of Lords, <HI>Gunning,</HI> Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Ely,</HI> maintained, that the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> was not ido|latrous. He was an&s;wered by <HI>Barlow,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln.</HI> The Lords did not much mind <HI>Gunning</HI>'s arguments, but pa&s;&s;ed the bill. And tho' <HI>Gunning</HI> had &s;aid, that he could not take that te&s;t with a good con&s;cience, yet, as &s;oon as the bill was pa&s;t, he took it in the croud with the re&s;t. The Duke got a provi&s;o <NOTE PLACE="marg">With a pro|vi&s;o for the Duke.</NOTE> to be put in it for excepting him&s;elf. He &s;poke upon that occa&s;ion with great earne&s;tne&s;s, and with tears in his eyes. He &s;aid, he was now to ca&s;t him&s;elf upon their favour in the greate&s;t concern he could have in this world. He &s;poke much of his duty to the King, and of his zeal for the Nation: And &s;olemnly prote&s;ted, that, whatever his religion might be, it &s;hould only be a private thing between God and his own &s;oul, and that no effect of it &s;hould ever appear in the govern|ment. The provi&s;o was carried for him by a few voices. And, contrary to all mens expectations, it pa&s;t in the Hou&s;e of Commons. There was al&s;o a provi&s;o put in, excepting nine La|dies about the Queen. And &s;he &s;aid, &s;he would have all the Ladies of that religion ca&s;t lots, who &s;hould be comprehended. Only &s;he named the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> as one whom &s;he would not expo&s;e to the uncertainty of a lot; which was not thought very decent in her, tho' her circum&s;tances at that time required an extraordinary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the King in every thing.</P>
<P><HI>Coleman</HI> was brought to his trial. <HI>Oates</HI> and <HI>Bedlow</HI> &s;wore flat|ly <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coleman</HI>'s trial</NOTE> again&s;t him, as was mentioned before. He denied, that he had ever &s;een either the one or the other of them in his whole life: And defended him&s;elf by <HI>Oates</HI>'s not knowing him, when they were fir&s;t confronted, nor objecting tho&s;e matters to him for a great while after. He al&s;o pre&s;&s;ed <HI>Oates</HI> to name the day in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> in which he had &s;ent the four&s;core guineas to the four ruffians. But <HI>Oates</HI> would fix on no day, tho' he was very punctu|al in matters of le&s;s moment. <HI>Coleman</HI> had been out of town al|mo&s;t that whole month. But, no day being named, that &s;erved him in no &s;tead. He urged the improbability of his talking to two &s;uch men, whom he had by their own confe&s;&s;ion never &s;een be|fore. But they &s;aid, he was told that they were tru&s;ted with the whole &s;ecret. His letters to <HI>P. de la Chai&s;e</HI> was the heavie&s;t part of the evidence. He did not deny, that there were many im|pertinent things in his letters: But, he &s;aid, he intended nothing in them, but the King's &s;ervice and the Duke's: He never in|tended to bring in the Catholick religion, by rebellion, or by blood, but only by a toleration: And the aid, that was pray'd from <HI>France,</HI> was only meant the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of money, and the in|terpo&s;ition of that Court. After a long trial, he was convicted:
<PB N="437" REF="452">
And &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon him to die as a traitor. He continued to his la&s;t breath denying every tittle of that which the witne&s;&s;es had &s;worn again&s;t him. Many were &s;ent to him from both Hou&s;es, offering to interpo&s;e for his pardon, if he would confe&s;s. He &s;till prote&s;ted his innocence, and took great care to vindicate the Duke. He &s;aid, his own heat might make him too forward: For, being per&s;uaded of the truth of his religion, he could not but wi&s;h, that all others were not only almo&s;t, but altogether, &s;uch as he was, except in that chain; for he was then in irons: He confe&s;&s;ed, he had mixed too much intere&s;t for rai&s;ing him&s;elf in all he did; and that he had received 2500 Guineas from the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador, to gain &s;ome friends to his ma&s;ter, but that he had kept them to him&s;elf: He had acted by order in all that he had done: And he believed the King knew of his employ|ment, particularly that at <HI>Bru&s;&s;els.</HI> But, tho' he &s;eemed willing to be que&s;tioned concerning the King, the Committee did not think fit to do it, nor to report what he &s;aid concerning it: On|ly in general they reported, that he &s;poke of another matter, about which they did not think fit to interrogate him, nor to mention it. <HI>Littleton</HI> was one of the Committee; and gave me an account of all that pa&s;s'd that very night. And I found his be|haviour made great impre&s;&s;ion on them all. He &s;uffered with <NOTE PLACE="marg">And execu|tion.</NOTE> much compo&s;ednefs and devotion; and died much better than he had lived. It was given out at that time, to make the Duke more odious, that <HI>Coleman</HI> was kept up from making confe&s;&s;ions, by the hopes the Duke &s;ent him of a pardon at <HI>Tyburn.</HI> But he could not be &s;o ignorant, as not to know that, at that time, it was not in the King's power to pardon him, while the tide went &s;o high.</P>
<P>The Nation was now &s;o much alarmed, that all people were fur|ni&s;hing them&s;elves with arms, which heightned the jealou&s;y of the Court. A bill pa&s;s'd in both Hou&s;es for rai&s;ing all the Militia, and for keeping it together for &s;ix weeks: A third part, if I remem|ber right, being to &s;erve a fortnight, and &s;o round. I found, &s;ome of them hoped when that bill pa&s;t into a law, they would be more ma&s;ters; and that the Militia would not &s;eparate, till all the demands of the two Hou&s;es &s;hould be granted. The King rejected the bill, when offered to him for his a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>I waited often on him all the month of <HI>December.</HI> He came <NOTE PLACE="marg">The $span$ $word$ $word$ this $word$ matter.</NOTE> to me to <HI>Chi$$inck</HI>'s, a Page of the back &s;tairs; and kept the time he a&s;&s;igned me to a minute. He was alone, and talked much, and very freely with me. We agreed in one thing, that the greate&s;t part of the evidence was a contrivance. But he &s;u&s;pected, &s;ome had &s;et on <HI>Oates,</HI> and in&s;tructed him: And he named the Earl of <HI>Shafts|bury.</HI> I was of another mind. I thought the many gro&s;s things
<PB N="438" REF="453">
in his narrative &s;hewed, there was no abler head than <HI>O ates,</HI> or <HI>Tonge,</HI> in the framing it: And <HI>Oates</HI> in his fir&s;t &s;tory had co|vered the Duke, and the Mini&s;ters &s;o much, that from thence it &s;eemed clear that Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> had no hand in it, who hated them much more than he did Popery. He fancied, there was a de&s;ign of a rebellion on foot. I a&s;&s;ured him, I &s;aw no appear|ances of it. I told him, there was a report breaking out, that he intended to legitimate the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> He an&s;wered quick, that, as well as he lov'd him, he had rather &s;ee him hang|ed. Yet he apprehended a rebellion &s;o much, that he &s;eemed not ill plea&s;ed that the party &s;hould flatter them&s;elves with that ima|gination, hoping that would keep them quiet in a dependance upon him&s;elf: And he &s;uffered the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> to u&s;e all methods to make him&s;elf popular, reckoning that he could keep him in his own management. He was &s;urpri&s;ed, when I told him that <HI>Coleman</HI> had in&s;inuated that he knew of all their fo|reign negotiations; or at lea&s;t he &s;eemed &s;o to me. I pre&s;&s;ed him much to oblige the Duke to enter into conferences with &s;ome of our Divines, and to be pre&s;ent at them him&s;elf. This would very much clear him of jealou&s;y, and might have a good effect on his brother: At lea&s;t it would give the world &s;ome hopes; like what <HI>Henry</HI> IV. of <HI>France,</HI> his grandfather, did, which kept a party firm to him for &s;ome time before he changed. He an&s;wered, that his brother had neither <HI>Henry</HI> IV. 's under&s;tanding, nor his con|&s;cience: For he believed, that King was always indifferent as to tho&s;e matters. He would not hearken to this, which made me incline to believe a report I had heard, that the Duke had got a &s;olemn promi&s;e of the King, that he would never &s;peak to him of religion. The King &s;poke much to me concerning <HI>Oates</HI>'s accu&s;ing the Queen, and acquainted me with the whole progre&s;s of it. He &s;aid, &s;he was a weak woman, and had &s;ome di&s;agree|able humours, but was not capable of a wicked thing: And, con&s;idering his faultine&s;s towards her in other things, he thought it a horrid thing to abandon her. He &s;aid, he looked on fal&s;e|hood and cruelty as the greate&s;t crimes in the &s;ight of God: He knew, he had led a bad life; (of which he &s;poke with &s;ome &s;en&s;e:) But he was breaking him&s;elf of all his faults: And he would never do a ba&s;e and a wicked thing. I &s;poke on all the&s;e $span$ what I thought became me, which he took well. And I encouraged him much in his re&s;olution of not expo&s;ing the Queen $word$ $span$&s;h by fal&s;e &s;wearing. I told him, there was no $span$ the heat that was now rai&s;ed, but by changing his Mini&s;try: And I told him how odious the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> was, and that there was a de&s;ign again&s;t him: But I knew not the par|ticulars. He &s;aid, he knew that lay at bottom. The Army was
<PB N="439" REF="454">
not yet di&s;banded: And the King was in great &s;traits for money. The Hou&s;e of Commons gave a money bill for this. Yet they would not tru&s;t the Court with the di&s;banding the Army: But ordered the money to be brought into the chamber of <HI>London,</HI> and named a Committee for paying off, and breaking the Army. I perceived the King thought I was re&s;erved to him, becau&s;e I would tell him no particular &s;tories, nor name per&s;ons. Upon which I told him, &s;ince he had that opinion of me, I &s;aw I could do him no &s;ervice, and would trouble him no more; but he &s;hould certainly hear from me, if I came to know any thing that might be of any con&s;equence to his Per&s;on or Government.</P>
<P>This favour of mine la&s;ted all the month of <HI>December</HI> 78. I acquainted him with <HI>Car&s;tair</HI>'s practice again&s;t Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> and all that I knew of that matter; which was the ground on which I had gone with relation to <HI>Staley.</HI> The King told Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> of it, without naming me. And he &s;ent for <HI>Car&s;tairs,</HI> and charged him with it. <HI>Car&s;tairs</HI> denied it all; but &s;aid, that Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> and Lord <HI>Kincardin</HI> had pre&s;s'd him to do it: And he went to the King and affirmed it confidently to him. He did not name Lord <HI>Athol,</HI> hoping that he would be gentle to him for that rea&s;on. The King &s;poke of this to Duke <HI>Hamil|ton,</HI> who told him the whole &s;tory, as I had done. Lord <HI>Athol</HI> upon that &s;ent for <HI>Car&s;tairs,</HI> and charged him with all this foul dealing, and drew him near a clo&s;et, where he had put two wit|ne&s;&s;es. <HI>Car&s;tairs</HI> &s;aid, that &s;omebody had di&s;covered the matter to Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> that he was now upon the point of making his fortune, and that if Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> grew to be his enemy, he was undone. He confe&s;&s;ed, he had charged Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> and Lord <HI>Kincardin</HI> fal&s;ely: But he had no other way to &s;ave him&s;elf. After the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Athol</HI> had thus drawn every thing from him, he went to the King with his two witne&s;&s;es, and the pa|per that <HI>Car&s;tairs</HI> had formerly put in his hand. <HI>Car&s;tairs</HI> was then with the King, and was, with many imprecations, ju&s;tifying his charge again&s;t the two Lords: But he was confounded, when he &s;aw Lord <HI>Athol.</HI> And upon that his villany appeared &s;o evidently, that the part I had acted in that matter was now well under&s;tood, and approved of. <HI>Car&s;tairs</HI> died, not long after, under great hor|ror; and ordered him&s;elf to be ca&s;t into &s;ome ditch as a dog; for he &s;aid he was no better. But I could never hear what he &s;aid of <HI>Staley</HI>'s bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>While all matters were in this confu&s;ion, a new incident hap|pened <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> that embroiled them yet more. The Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> had broke with <HI>Mountague:</HI> But he knew what letters he had writ to him, and with what &s;ecrets he had tru&s;ted him. He apprehend|ed <HI>Mountague</HI> might accu&s;e him: So he re&s;olved to prevent him.
<PB N="440" REF="455">
<HI>Jenkins,</HI> who was then at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> writ over, according to a di|rection &s;ent him, as was believed, that he under&s;tood that <HI>Moun|tague</HI> had been in a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence, and in dangerous practices with the Pope's Nuntio at <HI>Paris.</HI> This was meant of one <HI>Con,</HI> whom I knew well, who had been long in <HI>Rome:</HI> And mo&s;t of the letters between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> pa&s;t thro' his hands: He was a crafty man, and knew news well, and loved money: So <HI>Mountague</HI> made u&s;e of him, and gave him money for &s;uch &s;ecrets as he could draw from him. Upon <HI>Jenkins</HI>'s letter the King &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e of Commons, letting them know that he was re&s;olved to bring <HI>Mountague</HI> to a trial, for being a confederate with <HI>Rome,</HI> and in the plot to bring in Popery: And at the &s;ame time he &s;ent to &s;ecure his cabinets and papers. This was a device of Lord <HI>Danby</HI>'s to find his own letters, and de&s;troy them; and then to let the pro&s;ecution fall: For they knew they had nothing again&s;t <HI>Mountague.</HI> But <HI>Mountague</HI> under&s;tood the arts of a Court too well to be ea&s;ily catched; and had put a box, in which tho&s;e letters were, in &s;ure hands out of the way. A great de|bate ro&s;e upon this matter in the Hou&s;e of Commons. It was thought a high breach of privilege to &s;eize on the papers of a Member of their Hou&s;e, when there was nothing of trea&s;on &s;worn again&s;t him. After &s;ome hours &s;pent in the debate, during which <HI>Mountague</HI> &s;at &s;ilent very long; at la&s;t, when the box was brought to him from the per&s;on to whom he had tru&s;ted it, he opened it, and took out two of Lord <HI>Danby</HI>'s letters, that con|tained in&s;tructions to him to treat with the King of <HI>France</HI> for 300000 <HI>l.</HI> a year for three years, if a peace &s;ucceeded, &s;ince it would not be convenient for the King to meet a Parliament in all that time, and he was charged to mention no part of this to the Secretary of State. <HI>Winnington,</HI> who from &s;mall beginnings, and from as &s;mall a proportion of learning in his profe&s;&s;ion, in which he was rather bold and ready than able, was now come to be Solicitor General, fell &s;everely upon tho&s;e letters. He &s;aid, here was a Mini&s;ter, who, going out of the affairs of his own province, was directing the King's Emba&s;&s;adors, and excluding the Secretary of State, who&s;e office it was, from the knowledge of it: Here was the faith of <HI>England</HI> to our Allies, and our in|tere&s;t likewi&s;e, &s;et to &s;ale for <HI>French</HI> money, and that to keep off a Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament: This was a de&s;ign to &s;ell the Nation, and to &s;ubvert the Government: And he concluded, that was high trea&s;on. Upon which he moved, that Lord <HI>Danby</HI> &s;hould be impeached of high trea&s;on. The Earl of <HI>Danby</HI>'s party was much confounded. They could neither deny nor ju&s;tify his let|ters. But they argued, that they could not be high trea&s;on, &s;ince no &s;uch fact was comprehended in any of the &s;tatutes of
<PB N="441" REF="456">
trea&s;on: The letters &s;eemed to be writ by the King's order, who certainly might appoint any per&s;on he plea&s;ed to &s;end his orders to his Mini&s;ters abroad: They reflected on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and on con&s;tructive trea&s;om, which was a device to condemn a man for a fact again&s;t which no law did lie. <HI>Mainard,</HI> an ancient and eminent lawyer, explained the words of the Statute of 25 <HI>Edward</HI> III, that the Courts of law could not proceed but upon one of the crimes there enumerated: But the Parliament had &s;till a power, by the clau&s;e in that act, to declare what they thought was trea&s;on: So an act pa&s;s'd, de|claring poi&s;oning trea&s;on, in King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. 's time: And, tho' by the Statute it was only trea&s;on to con&s;pire again&s;t the Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> yet if one &s;hould con&s;pire again&s;t the whole Royal Fa|mily, when there was no Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> they would without doubt declare that to be high trea&s;on.</P>
<P>After a long debate it was voted by a majority of above &s;eventy <NOTE PLACE="marg">And he was impeached of high trea|&s;on.</NOTE> voices, that Lord <HI>Danby</HI> &s;hould be impeached of high trea&s;on. And the impeachment was next day carried up to the Lords. The Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> ju&s;tified him&s;elf, that he had &s;erved the King faithfully, and according to his own orders. And he produced &s;ome of <HI>Mountague</HI>'s letters, to &s;hew that at the Court of <HI>France</HI> he was looked on as an enemy to their intere&s;t. He &s;aid, they knew him well that judged &s;o of him; for he was indeed an ene|my to it: And, among other rea&s;ons, he gave this for one, that he knew the <HI>French</HI> King held both the King's per&s;on and go|vernment under the la&s;t degree of contempt. The&s;e words were thought very &s;trange with relation to both Kings. A great de|bate aro&s;e in the Hou&s;e of Lords concerning the impeachment; whether it ought to be received as an impeachment of high trea&s;on, only becau&s;e the Commons added the word high trea&s;on in it. It was &s;aid, the utmo&s;t that could be made of it, was to &s;uppo&s;e it true: But even in that ca&s;e they mu&s;t needs &s;ay plainly, that it was not within the Sta|tute. To this it was an&s;wered, that the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, that brought up the impeachment, were to be heard to two points: The one was, to the nature of the crime: The other was, to the trial of it: But the Lords could not take upon them to judge of either of the&s;e, till they heard what the Commons could offer to &s;upport the charge: They were bound therefore to receive the charge, and to proceed according to the rules of Parliament, which was to commit the per&s;on &s;o im|peached, and then give a &s;hort day for his trial: So it would be &s;oon over, if the Commons could not prove the matter charged to be high trea&s;on. The debate went on with great heat on both &s;ides: But the majority was again&s;t the commit|ment.
<PB N="442" REF="457">
Upon this, it was vi&s;ible, the Commons would have com|plained that the Lords denied them ju&s;tice. So there was no hope of making up the matter. And upon that the Parliament <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment was prorogued</NOTE> was prorogued.</P>
<P>This was variou&s;ly cen&s;ured. The Court condemned <HI>Moun|tague</HI> for revealing the King's &s;ecrets. Others &s;aid, that, &s;ince Lord <HI>Danby</HI> had begun to fall on him, it was rea&s;onable and natural for him to defend him&s;elf. The letters did ca&s;t a very great blemi&s;h, not only on Lord <HI>Danby,</HI> but on the King; who, after he had entred into alliances, and had received great &s;upplies from his people to carry on a war, was thus treating with <HI>France</HI> for money, which could not be a&s;ked or obtained from <HI>France</HI> on any other account, but that of making the Con|federates accept of lower terms, than otherwi&s;e they would have &s;tood on; which was indeed the &s;elling of the Allies and of the publick &s;aith. All that the Court &s;aid in excu&s;e for this was, that, &s;ince the King &s;aw a peace was re&s;olved on, after he had put him&s;elf to &s;o great a charge to prepare for war, it was rea&s;on|able for him to be reimbur&s;ed as much as he could from <HI>France:</HI> This was ordinary in all treaties, where the Prince that de&s;ired a peace was made to buy it. This indeed would have ju&s;tified the King, if it had been demanded above board: But &s;uch underhand dealing was mean and di&s;honourable: And it was &s;aid, that the States went into the peace with &s;uch unrea&s;onable earne&s;tne&s;s upon the knowledge, or at lea&s;t the &s;u&s;picion, that they had of &s;uch practices. This gave a new wound to the King's credit abroad, or rather it opened the old one: For indeed after our breaking both the treaty of <HI>Breda,</HI> and the Tripple Alliance, we had not much credit to lo&s;e abroad. None gained &s;o much by this di&s;covery, as Secre|tary <HI>Coventry;</HI> &s;ince now it appeared, that he was not tru&s;ted with tho&s;e ill practices. He had been &s;everely fallen on for the fam'd &s;aying of the murder of forty men. <HI>Birch</HI> aggravated the matter heavily; and &s;aid, it &s;eemed he thought the murder of firty men a very &s;mall matter, &s;ince he would rather be guilty of it, than oppo&s;e an Alliance made upon &s;uch treacherous views. <HI>Coventry</HI> an&s;wered, that he always &s;poke to them &s;incerely, and as he thought; and that if an Angel from Heaven &s;hould come and &s;ay otherwi&s;e, (at this they were very attentive to &s;ee how he could clo&s;e a period &s;o &s;trangely begun,) he was &s;ure, he &s;hould never get back to Heaven again, but would be a fallen and a lying angel. Now the matter was well under&s;tood, and his cre|dit was &s;et on a &s;ure foot.</P>
<P>After the prorogation, the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> &s;aw the King's af|fairs, and the &s;tate of the Nation required a &s;peedy Se&s;&s;ion. He &s;aw little hope of recovering him&s;elf with that Parliament, in which &s;o great a majority were already &s;o deeply engaged. So he
<PB N="443" REF="458">
entred into a treaty with &s;ome of the Country party for a new Parliament. He undertook to get the Duke to be &s;ent out of the way again&s;t the time of its meeting. Lord <HI>Hollis, Littleton, Bo$|cawen,</HI> and <HI>Hambden</HI> were &s;poke to. They were all &s;o apprehen|&s;ive of the continuance of that Parliament, and that another &s;et of Mini&s;ters would be able to manage them as the Court plea&s;ed, that they did undertake to &s;ave him if he could bring the&s;e things about. But it was under&s;tood, that he mu&s;t quit his po&s;t, and withdraw from affairs. Upon which they promi&s;ed their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to carry off his impeachment with a mild cen&s;ure. The Duke went into the advice of a di&s;&s;olution upon other grounds. He thought, the Hou&s;e of Commons had engaged with &s;o much heat in the matter of the Plot, that they could ne|ver be brought off, or be made more gentle in the matter of re|ligion. He thought, a new Parliament would act in a milder &s;train, and not fly &s;o high; or that they would give no money, and &s;o the King and they would break: For he dreaded nothing &s;o much as the bargains that were made with the pre&s;ent Parlia|ment, in which Popery was always to be the &s;acrifice. Thus both the Duke and Lord <HI>Danby</HI> joined in advancing a di&s;&s;o|lution, which was not re&s;olved on till the <HI>January</HI> following.</P>
<P>In <HI>December, Ireland, Whitebread,</HI> and <HI>Fenwick,</HI> three Je&s;uites; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The trial of <HI>F. Ireland</HI> and &s;ome others.</NOTE> and <HI>Grove</HI> and <HI>Pickering,</HI> two of the &s;ervant's in the Queen's chapel, were brought to their trial. <HI>Oates</HI> and <HI>Bedlow</HI> &s;wore home again&s;t <HI>Ireland,</HI> that in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t he had given particular orders about killing the King. <HI>Oates</HI> &s;wore the &s;ame again&s;t the other two Je&s;uites. But <HI>Bedlow</HI> &s;wore only upon hear-&s;ay again&s;t them. So, tho' they had pleaded to their inditement, and the jury was &s;worn, and the witne&s;&s;es examined; yet, when the evi|dence was not found full, their trial was put off to another time, and the jury was not charged with them. This looked, as if it was re&s;olv'd that they mu&s;t not be accquitted. I complained of this to <HI>Jones:</HI> But he &s;aid, they had precedents for it. I always thought, that a precedent again&s;t rea&s;on &s;ignified no more, but that the like inju&s;tice had been done before. And the truth is, the Crown has, or at lea&s;t had, &s;uch advantages in trials of trea&s;on, that it &s;eems &s;trange how any per&s;on was ever acquitted. <HI>Ireland,</HI> in his own defence, proved by many witne&s;&s;es, that he went from <HI>London</HI> on the &s;econd of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> to <HI>Stafford&s;hire,</HI> and did not come back till the twelfth of <HI>September.</HI> Yet, in oppo&s;ition to that, a woman &s;wore that &s;he &s;aw him in <HI>London</HI> about the mid|dle of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> So, &s;ince he might have come up po&s;t in one day, and gone down in another, this did not &s;atisfy. <HI>Oates</HI> and <HI>Bed|low</HI> &s;wore again&s;t <HI>Grove</HI> and <HI>Pickering,</HI> that they undertook to &s;hoot the King at <HI>Wind&s;or;</HI> that <HI>Grove</HI> was to have 1500 <HI>l.</HI> for
<PB N="444" REF="459">
it; and that <HI>Pickering</HI> cho&s;e thirty thou&s;and ma&s;&s;es, which, at a &s;hil|ling a ma&s;s, amounted to the &s;ame &s;um: They attempted it three &s;everal times with a pi&s;tol: Once the flint was loo&s;e: At another time there was no powder in the pan: And the third time the pi&s;tol was charged only with bullets. This was &s;trange &s;tuff. But all was imputed to a &s;pecial providence of God: And the whole evidence was believed. So they were convicted, con|demned, and executed. But they denied to the la&s;t every particu|lar that was &s;worn again&s;t them.</P>
<P>This began to &s;hake the credit of the evidence, when a more <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dugdale</HI>'s evidence.</NOTE> compo&s;ed and credible per&s;on came in to &s;upport it. One <HI>Dug|dale,</HI> that had been the Lord <HI>A&s;ton</HI>'s bailiff, and lived in a fair re|putation in the country, was put in pri&s;on for refu&s;ing the oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy. He did then, with many impre|cations on him&s;elf, deny, that he knew of any plot. But after|wards he made a great di&s;covery of a corre&s;pondence that <HI>Evers,</HI> the Lord <HI>A&s;hton</HI>'s Je&s;uite, held with the Je&s;uites in <HI>London;</HI> who had writ to <HI>Evers</HI> of the de&s;ign of killing the King, and de&s;ired him to find out men proper for executing it, whether they were gentlemen or not. This, he &s;wore, was writ plain in a letter from <HI>Whitebread,</HI> the Provincial, directed to him&s;elf: But he knew it was meant for <HI>Evers. Evens,</HI> and <HI>Govan,</HI> another Je&s;uite, pre&s;&s;ed this <HI>Dugdale</HI> to undertake it: They promi&s;ed he &s;hould be canonized for it: And the Lord <HI>Stafford</HI> offered him 500 <HI>l,</HI> if he would &s;et about it. He was a man of &s;en&s;e and temper; and behaved him&s;elf decently; and had &s;omewhat in his air and de|portment that di&s;po&s;ed people to believe him: So that the King him&s;elf began to think there was &s;omewhat in the Plot, tho' he had very little regard either to <HI>Oates</HI> or <HI>Bedlow. Dugdale</HI>'s evidence was much confirmed by one circum&s;tance. He had talked of a Ju&s;tice of peace in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> that was killed, on the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> after <HI>Godfrey</HI> was mi&s;s'd: So that the news of this mu&s;t have been writ from <HI>London</HI> on the <HI>Saturday</HI> night's po&s;t. He did not think it was a &s;ecret: And &s;o he talk'd of it as news in an ale|hou&s;e. The two per&s;ons, he &s;aid he &s;poke it to, remembred no|thing of it, the one being the mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h: But &s;eve|ral others &s;wore they had heard it. He &s;aw this, as he &s;wore, in a letter writ by <HI>Harcourt</HI> the Je&s;uite to <HI>Evers,</HI> in which <HI>Godfrey</HI> was named. But he added a &s;trange &s;tory to this, which he &s;aid <HI>Evers</HI> told him afterwards; that the Duke had &s;ent to <HI>Coleman,</HI> when he was in <HI>Newgate,</HI> to per&s;uade him to di&s;cover nothing, and that he de&s;ired to know of him, whether he had ever di&s;|covered their de&s;igns to any other per&s;on; and that <HI>Coleman</HI> &s;ent back an&s;wer, that he had &s;poke of them to <HI>Godfrey,</HI> but to no other man: Upon which the Duke gave order to kill him. This was
<PB N="445" REF="460">
never made publick, till the Lord <HI>Stafford</HI>'s trial. And I was amaz|ed to &s;ee &s;uch a thing break out after &s;o long a &s;ilence. It looked like an addition to <HI>Dugdale</HI>'s fir&s;t evidence; tho' he had been noted for having brought out all his di&s;coveries at once. The Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> told me, he &s;wore it in his fir&s;t examination: But, &s;ince it was only upon hear-&s;ay from <HI>Evers,</HI> and &s;o was nothing in law, and yet would heighten the fury again&s;t the Duke, the King charged <HI>Dugdale</HI> to &s;ay nothing of it.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time a particular di&s;covery was made of <HI>Godfrey</HI>'s <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prance</HI> di&s;|covers <HI>God|frey</HI>'s mur|der.</NOTE> murder. <HI>Prance,</HI> a gold&s;mith, that wrought for the Queen's cha|pel, had gone from his hou&s;e for two or three days, the week before the murder. And one that lodged in his hou&s;e, calling that to mind, upon <HI>Bedlow</HI>'s &s;wearing he &s;aw the body in <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> hou&s;e, fancied that this was the time in which he was from home, and that he might be concerned in that matter; tho' it appeared afterwards, that his ab&s;ence was the week before. He &s;aid, he went from his own hou&s;e, fearing to be put in pri&s;on, as many were, upon &s;u&s;picion, or on the account of his religion. Yet upon this information he was &s;eized on, and carried to <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter. Bedlow</HI> accidentally pa&s;s'd by, not knowing any thing con|cerning him: And at fir&s;t &s;ight he charged &s;omebody to &s;eize on him; for he was one of tho&s;e whom he &s;aw about <HI>Godfrey</HI>'s body. Yet he denied every thing for &s;ome days. Afterwards he con|fe&s;&s;ed, he was concerned in it: And he gave this account of it: <HI>Girald</HI> and <HI>Killy,</HI> two prie&s;ts, engaged him and three others into it; who were <HI>Green,</HI> that belonged to the Queen's chapel, <HI>Hill,</HI> that had &s;erved <HI>Godden,</HI> the mo&s;t celebrated writer among them, and <HI>Berry,</HI> the porter of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> hou&s;e. He &s;aid, the&s;e all, ex|cept <HI>Berry,</HI> had &s;everal meetings, in which the prie&s;ts per&s;uaded them it was no &s;in, but a meritorious action, to di&s;patch <HI>Godfrey,</HI> who had been a bu&s;y man in taking depo&s;itions again&s;t them, and that the taking him off would terrify others. <HI>Prance</HI> named an alehou&s;e, where they u&s;ed to meet: And the people of that hou&s;e did confirm this of their meeting there. After they had re&s;olved on it, they followed him for &s;everal days. The mor|ning before they killed him, <HI>Hill</HI> went to his hou&s;e to &s;ee if he was yet gone out, and &s;poke to his maid. And, finding he was yet at home, they &s;taid for his coming out. This was confirmed by the maid, who, upon <HI>Hill</HI>'s being taken, went to <HI>Newgate,</HI> and, in a croud of pri&s;oners, di&s;tingui&s;hed him, and &s;aid, he was the per&s;on that a&s;ked for her ma&s;ter the morning before he was lo&s;t. <HI>Prance</HI> &s;aid, they dogged him into a place near St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s Church, where he was kept till night. <HI>Prance</HI> was appointed to be at <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> hou&s;e at night. And, as <HI>Godfrey</HI> went by the wa|ter gate, two of them pretended to be hot in a quarrel. And one
<PB N="446" REF="461">
run out to call a Ju&s;tice of peace, and &s;o pre&s;&s;ed <HI>Godfrey</HI> to go in and part them. He was not ea&s;ily prevailed on to do it. Yet he did at la&s;t. <HI>Green</HI> then got behind him, and pulled a cravat about his neck, and drew him down to the ground, and &s;trangled him. Upon that <HI>Girald</HI> would have run him thro': But the re&s;t diverted him from that, by repre&s;enting the danger of a di&s;covery by the blood's being &s;een there. Upon that they carried his body up to <HI>Godden's</HI> room, of which <HI>Hill</HI> had the key, <HI>Godden</HI> being then in <HI>France.</HI> Two days after that they removed it to a room cro&s;s the upper court, which <HI>Prance</HI> could never de&s;cribe particularly. And, that not being found a con|venient place, they carried it back to <HI>Godden's</HI> lodgings. At la&s;t it was re&s;olved to carry it out in the night in a &s;edan to the re|mote parts of the town, and from thence to ca&s;t it into &s;ome ditch. On <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> a &s;edan was provided. And one of the cen|tinels &s;wore he &s;aw a &s;edan carried in: But none &s;aw it brought out. <HI>Prance</HI> &s;aid, they carried him out, and that <HI>Green</HI> had provided a hor&s;e, on who&s;e back he laid him, when they were got clear of the town: And then he carried him, as he believed, to the place where his body was found. This was a con&s;i&s;ting &s;tory, which was &s;upported in &s;ome circum&s;tances by collateral proofs. He added another particular, that, &s;ome days after the fact, tho&s;e who had been concerned in it, and two others, who were in the &s;ecret, appointed to meet at <HI>Bow,</HI> where they talked much of that matter. This was confirmed by a &s;ervant of that hou&s;e, who was coming in and out to them, and heard them often mention <HI>Godfrey's</HI> name. Upon which he &s;tood at the door out of curio&s;ity to hearken: But one of them came out, and threatened him for it. The prie&s;ts were not found: But <HI>Green, Hill,</HI> and <HI>Berry</HI> were apprehended upon it. Yet &s;ome days after this, <HI>Prance</HI> de&s;ired to be carried to the King, who would not &s;ee him, but in Council: And he denied all that he had formerly &s;worn, and &s;aid it was all a fiction. But as &s;oon as he was carried back to pri|&s;on, he &s;ent the keeper of <HI>Newgate</HI> to the King to tell him, that all he had &s;worn was true, but that the horror and confu&s;ion he was in put him on denying it. Yet he went off from this again, and denied every thing. Dr. <HI>Lloyd</HI> was upon this &s;ent to him to talk with him. At fir&s;t he denied every thing to him. But Dr. <HI>Lloyd</HI> &s;aid to me, that he was almo&s;t dead thro' the di&s;order of his mind, and with cold in his body. But after that Dr. <HI>Lloyd</HI> had made a fire, and cau&s;ed him to be put in a bed, and began to di&s;cour&s;e the matter with him, he returned to his confe&s;&s;ion; which he did in &s;uch a manner, that <HI>Lloyd</HI> &s;aid to me, it was not po&s;&s;ible for him to doubt of his &s;incerity in it.</P>
<P>So, he per&s;i&s;ting in his fir&s;t confe&s;&s;ion, <HI>Green, Hill</HI> and <HI>Berry</HI> were brought to their trial. <HI>Bedlow</HI> and <HI>Prance,</HI> with all the circum&s;tances <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some con|demned for it, who died denying it.</NOTE> formerly mentioned, were the evidence again&s;t them. On the other hand they brought witne&s;&s;es to prove, that they came home in a
<PB N="447" REF="462">
good hour on the nights, in which the fact was &s;aid to be done. Tho&s;e that lived in <HI>Godden's</HI> lodgings depo&s;ed, that no dead body could be brought thither, for they were every day in the room that <HI>Prance</HI> had named. And the centinels of that night of the carrying him out &s;aid, they &s;aw no &s;edan brought out. They were, upon a full hearing, convicted and condemned. <HI>Green,</HI> and <HI>Hill,</HI> died, as they had lived, Papi&s;ts; and, with &s;olemn prote&s;tations, denied the whole thing. <HI>Berry</HI> declared him&s;elf a Prote&s;tant; and that tho' he had changed his religion for fear of lo&s;ing his place, yet he had &s;till continued to be one in his heart. He &s;aid, he looked on what had now befallen him, as a ju&s;t judgment of God upon him for that di&s;&s;imulation. He denied the whole matter charged on him. He &s;eemed to prepare him&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly for death: And to the la&s;t minute he affirmed he was altogether innocent. Dr. <HI>Lloyd</HI> attended on him, and was much per&s;uaded of his &s;incerity. <HI>Prance</HI> &s;wore no|thing again&s;t him, but that he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the fact, and in carrying about the dead body. So <HI>Lloyd</HI> reckoned, that, tho&s;e things being done in the night, <HI>Prance</HI> might have mi&s;taken him for &s;ome other per&s;on, who might be like him, con&s;idering the confu&s;ion that &s;o much guilt might have put him in. He therefore believed, <HI>Prance</HI> had &s;worn ra&s;hly with relation to him, but truly as to the main of the fact. The Papi&s;ts took great advantage from <HI>Berry's</HI> dying a Prote&s;tant, and yet denying all that was &s;worn again&s;t him, tho' he might have had his life if he would have confe&s;&s;ed it. They &s;aid, this &s;hewed it was not from the doctrine of equivocation, or from the power of ab&s;olution, or any other of their tenets, that &s;o many died, denying all that was &s;worn again&s;t them, but from their own conviction. And indeed this matter came to be charged on Dr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> as if he had been made a tool for bringing <HI>Berry</HI> to this &s;eeming conver&s;ion, and that all was done on de&s;ign to cover the Queen. But I &s;aw him then every day, and was well a&s;&s;ured that he acted nothing in it, but what became his profe&s;&s;ion, with all po&s;&s;i|ble &s;incerity. <HI>Prance</HI> began, after this, to enlarge his di&s;coveries. He &s;aid, he had often heard them talk of killing the King, and of &s;etting on a general ma&s;&s;acre, after they had rai&s;ed an Army. <HI>Dug|dale</HI> al&s;o &s;aid, he had heard them di&s;cour&s;e of a ma&s;&s;acre. The me|mory of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> ma&s;&s;acre was yet &s;o fre&s;h, as to rai&s;e a particular horror at the very mention of this; tho' where the numbers were &s;o great as in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that might have been executed, yet there &s;eemed to be no oca&s;ion to apprehend the like, where the numbers were in &s;o great an inequality, as they were here. <HI>Prance</HI> did al&s;o &s;wear, that a &s;ervant of the Lord <HI>Powis</HI> had told him that there was one in their family who had undertaken to kill the King; but that &s;ome days after he told him, they were now gone off from that de&s;ign. It looked very &s;trange, and added no credit to his other evi|dence,
<PB N="448" REF="463">
that the Papi&s;ts &s;hould be thus talking of killing the King, as if it had been a common piece of news. But there are &s;ea&s;ons of be|lieving, as well as of di&s;believing: And believing was then &s;o much in &s;ea&s;on, that improbabilities or incon&s;i&s;tencies were little con&s;idered. Nor was it &s;afe &s;o much as to make reflections on them. That was called the bla&s;ting of the plot, and di&s;paraging the King's evidence: Tho' indeed <HI>Oates</HI> and <HI>Bedlow</HI> did, by their behaviour, detract more from their own credit, than all their enemies could have done. The former talked of all per&s;ons with in &s;ufferable in&s;olence: And the other was a &s;candalous libertine in his whole deportment.</P>
<P>The Lord Chief Ju&s;tice at that time was Sir <HI>William Scroggs,</HI> a man <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Scroggs</HI> was then Lord Chief Ju&s;|&s;tice.</NOTE> more valued for a good readine&s;s in &s;peaking well, than either for learning in his profe&s;&s;ion, or for any moral virtue. His life had been indecently &s;candalous, and his fortunes were very low. He was rai&s;ed by the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI>'s favour, fir&s;t to be a Judge, and then to be the Chief Ju&s;tice. And it was a melancholy thing to &s;ee &s;o bad, &s;o igno|rant, and &s;o poor a man rai&s;ed up to that great po&s;t. Yet he, now &s;eeing how the &s;tream run, went into it with &s;o much zeal and heartine&s;s, that he was become the favourite of the people. But, when he &s;aw the King had an ill opinion of it, he grew colder in the pur&s;uit of it. He began to neglect and check the witne&s;&s;es: Upon which, they, who behaved them&s;elves as if they had been the Tribunes of the people, began to rail at him. Yet in all the trials he &s;et him&s;elf, even with indecent earne&s;tne&s;s, to get the pri&s;oners to be always ca&s;t.</P>
<P>Another witne&s;s came in &s;oon after the&s;e things, <HI>Jenni&s;on,</HI> the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jenni&s;on</HI>'s evidence.</NOTE> younger brother of a Je&s;uite, and a gentleman of a family and e&s;tate. He, ob&s;erving that <HI>Ireland</HI> had defended him&s;elf again&s;t <HI>Oates</HI> chiefly by this, that he was in <HI>Stafford&s;hire</HI> from the begin|ning of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> till the 12^t^h of <HI>September,</HI> and that he had died af|firming that to be true, &s;eemed much &s;urprized at it; and upon that turned Prote&s;tant. For he &s;aid, he &s;aw him in <HI>London</HI> on the 19^t^h of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> on which day he fixed upon this account, that he &s;aw him the day before he went down in the &s;tage coach to <HI>York,</HI> which was proved by the books of that office to be the 20^t^h of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> He &s;aid, he was come to town from <HI>Wind&s;or:</HI> And hearing that <HI>Ireland</HI> was in town, he went to &s;ee him, and found him drawing off his boots. <HI>Ireland</HI> a&s;ked him news, and in particular, how the King was attended at <HI>Wind&s;or?</HI> And when he an&s;wered, that he walked about very care|le&s;ly with very few about him, <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;eemed to wonder at it, and &s;aid, it would be ea&s;y then to take him off: To which <HI>Jenni&s;on</HI> an&s;wered quick, God &s;orbid: But <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;aid, he did not mean that it could be lawfully done. <HI>Jenni&s;on,</HI> in the letter in which he writ this up to a friend in <HI>London,</HI> added, that he remembred an incon&s;iderable pa&s;&s;age or two more, and that perhaps <HI>Smith</HI> (a Prie&s;t that had lived with his Father) could help him to one or two more circum&s;tances
<PB N="449" REF="464">
relating to tho&s;e matters: But he prote&s;ted, as he de&s;ired the for|givene&s;s of his &s;ins, and the &s;alvation of his &s;oul, that he knew no more; and wi&s;hed he might never &s;ee the face of God, if he knew any more. This letter was printed. And great u&s;e was made of it, to &s;hew how little regard was to be had to tho&s;e denials, with which &s;o many had ended their lives. But this man in the &s;ummer thereafter pub|li&s;hed a long narrative of his knowledge of the plot. He &s;aid, him|&s;elf had been invited to a&s;&s;i&s;t in killing the King. He named the four ruffians that went to <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> to do it. And he thought to have reconciled this to his letter, by pretending the&s;e were the circum|&s;tances, that he had not mentioned in it. <HI>Smith</HI> did al&s;o change his religion; and depo&s;ed, that, when he was at <HI>Rome,</HI> he was told in general of the de&s;ign of killing the King. He was afterwards di&s;co|vered to be a vicious man. Yet he went no farther than to &s;wear, that he was acquainted with the de&s;ign in general, but not with the per|&s;ons that were employed in it. By the&s;e witne&s;&s;es the credit of the plot was univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed. Yet, no real proofs appearing, be|&s;ides <HI>Coleman</HI>'s letters and <HI>Godfrey</HI>'s murder, the King, by a procla|mation, did offer both a pardon and 200 <HI>l.</HI> to any one that would come in, and make further di&s;coveries. This was thought too great a hire to purcha&s;e witne&s;&s;es. Money had been offered to tho&s;e who &s;hould bring in criminals. But it was &s;aid to be a new and indecent practice to offer &s;o much money to men, that &s;hould merit it by &s;wearing: And it might be too great an encouragement to perjury.</P>
<P>While the witne&s;&s;es were weakning their own credit, &s;ome <NOTE PLACE="marg">Practices with the witne&s;&s;es di&s;covered.</NOTE> practices were di&s;covered, that did very much &s;upport it. <HI>Reading,</HI> a lawyer of &s;ome &s;ubtilty, but of no vertue, was employ|ed by the Lords in the Tower to &s;olicit their affairs. He in&s;inuated him&s;elf much into <HI>Bedlow</HI>'s confidence, and was much in his com|pany: And, in the hearing of others, he was always pre&s;&s;ing him to tell all he knew. He lent him money very freely, which the other wanted often. And he &s;eemed at fir&s;t to de&s;ign only to find out &s;ome|what that &s;hould de&s;troy the credit of his te&s;timony. But he ventured on other practices; and offered him much money, if he would turn his evidence again&s;t the Popi&s;h Lords only into a hear-&s;ay, &s;o that it &s;hould not come home again&s;t them. <HI>Reading</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Bedlow</HI> began the propo&s;ition to him; and employed him to &s;ee how much money the&s;e Lords could give him, if he &s;hould bring them off: Upon which, <HI>Reading,</HI> as he pretended afterwards, &s;eeing that innocent blood was like to be &s;hed, was willing, even by indecent means, to endeavour to prevent it. Yet he freed the Lords in the Tower. He &s;aid, they would not promi&s;e a farthing: Only the Lord <HI>Stafford</HI> &s;aid, he would give him&s;elf two or three hundred pounds, which he might di&s;po&s;e of as he plea&s;ed. While <HI>Reading</HI> was driving the bargain, <HI>Bedlow</HI> was too hard for him at his own trade of craft: For, as he acquainted
<PB N="450" REF="465">
both Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> with the whole negotia|tion, from the fir&s;t &s;tep of it, &s;o he placed two witne&s;&s;es &s;ecretly in his chamber, when <HI>Reading</HI> was to come to him; and drew him into tho&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, which di&s;covered the whole practice of that cor|ruption. <HI>Reading</HI> had likewi&s;e drawn a paper, by which he &s;hewed him with how few and &s;mall alterations he could &s;often his depo&s;iti|on, &s;o as not to affect the Lords. With the&s;e witne&s;&s;es, and this paper, <HI>Bedlow</HI> charged <HI>Reading.</HI> The whole matter was proved beyond con|tradiction. And, as this rai&s;ed his credit, &s;o it laid a heavy load on the Popi&s;h Lords; tho' the proofs came home only to <HI>Reading,</HI> and he was &s;et in the pillory for it. <HI>Bedlow</HI> made a very ill u&s;e of this di&s;co|very, which happened in <HI>March,</HI> to cover his having &s;worn again&s;t <HI>Whitebread</HI> and <HI>Fenwick</HI> only upon hear-&s;ay in <HI>December:</HI> For, being re&s;olved to &s;wear plain matter upon his own knowledge again&s;t them, when they &s;hould be brought again on their trial, he &s;aid, <HI>Reading</HI> had prevailed on him to be ea&s;y to them, as he called it; and that he had &s;aid to him that the Lords would take the &s;aving of the&s;e Je&s;uites, as an earne&s;t of what he would do for them&s;elves; tho' it was not very probable, that the&s;e Lords would have abandoned <HI>Ireland,</HI> when they took &s;uch care of the other Je&s;uites. The truth was, he ought to have been &s;et a&s;ide from being a witne&s;s any more, &s;ince now by his own confe&s;&s;ion he had &s;worn fal&s;ly in that trial: He had fir&s;t &s;worn, he knew nothing of his own knowledge again&s;t the two Je|&s;uites, and afterwards he &s;wore copiou&s;ly again&s;t them, and upon his own knowledge. <HI>Wyld,</HI> a worthy and ancient Judge, &s;aid upon that to him, that he was a perjured man, and ought to come no more into Courts, but to go home, and repent. Yet all this was pa&s;t over, as if it had been of no weight: And the Judge was turned out for his plain freedom. There was &s;oon after this another practice di&s;covered concerning <HI>Oates.</HI> Some that belonged to the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> con|ver&s;ed much with <HI>Oates</HI>'s his &s;ervants. They told them many odious things that he was daily &s;peaking of the King, which looked liker one that intended to ruin than to &s;ave him. One of the&s;e did al&s;o af|firm, that <HI>Oates</HI> had made an abominable attempt upon him not fit to be named. <HI>Oates</HI> &s;melled this out, and got his &s;ervants to deny all that they had &s;aid, and to fa&s;ten it upon tho&s;e who had been with them, as a practice of theirs: And they were upon that likewi&s;e &s;et on the pillory. And, to put things of a &s;ort together, tho' they happen'd not all at once: One <HI>Tasborough,</HI> that belonged to the Duke's court, entred into &s;ome corre&s;pondence with <HI>Dugdale,</HI> who was courting a kin&s;woman of his. It was propo&s;ed, that <HI>Dugdale</HI> &s;hould &s;ign a paper, retracting all that he had formerly &s;worn, and &s;hould upon that go beyond &s;ea, for which he was promi&s;ed, in the Duke's name, a con&s;iderable reward. He had written the paper, as was de|&s;ired: But he was too cunning for <HI>Tasborough,</HI> and he proved his
<PB N="451" REF="466">
practices upon him. He pretended he drew the paper only to draw the other further on, that he might be able to penetrate the deeper into their de&s;igns. <HI>Tasborough</HI> was fined, and &s;et in the pillory for tampering thus with the King's evidence.</P>
<P>This was the true &s;tate of the plot, and of the witne&s;&s;es that prov|ed it; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections upon the whole evi|dence.</NOTE> which I have open'd as fully as was po&s;&s;ible for me: And I had particular occa&s;ions to be well in&s;tructed in it. Here was matter enough to work on the fears and apprehen&s;ions of the Nation: So it was not to be wondred at, if Parliaments were hot, and Juries were ea&s;y in this pro&s;ecution. The vi&s;ible evidences that appeared, made all people conclude there was great plotting among them. And it was generally believed, that the bulk of what was &s;worn by the witne&s;&s;es was true, tho' they had by all appearance dre&s;&s;ed it up with incredible circum&s;tances. What the men of learning knew concerning their principles, both of depo&s;ing of Kings, and of the lawfulne&s;s of murdering them when &s;o depo&s;ed, made them ea|&s;ily conclude, that &s;ince they &s;aw the Duke was &s;o entirely theirs, and that the King was &s;o little to be depended on, they might think the pre&s;ent conjuncture was not to be lo&s;t. And &s;ince the Duke's elde&s;t daughter was already out of their hands, they might make the more ha&s;te to &s;et the Duke on the throne. The tempers, as well as the morals, of the Je&s;uites, made it rea&s;onable to believe, that they were not apt to neglect &s;uch advantages, nor to &s;tick at any &s;ort of fal&s;hood in order to their own defence. The doctrine of probability, be&s;ides many other maxims that are current among them, made ma|ny give little credit to their witne&s;&s;es, or to their mo&s;t &s;olemn deni|als, even at their execution. Many things were brought to &s;hew, that by the ca&s;ui&s;tical divinity taught among them, and publi&s;hed by them to the world, there was no practice &s;o bad, but that the doctrines of probability, and of ordering the intention, might ju&s;tify it. Yet many thought, that, what doctrines &s;oever men might by a &s;ubtilty of &s;peculation be carried into, the approaches of death, with the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s that appeared in their deportment, mu&s;t needs work &s;o much on the probity and candor which &s;eemed rooted in human nature, that even immoral opinions, maintained in the way of argument, could not then re&s;i&s;t it. Several of our Di|vines went far in this charge, again&s;t all regard to their dying &s;peeches; of which &s;ome of our own Church complained, as inhu|man and indecent.</P>
<P>In <HI>January</HI> a new Parliament was &s;ummoned. The elections <NOTE PLACE="marg">16-9 A new Par|liament.</NOTE> were carried with great heat, and went almo&s;t every where again&s;t the Court. Lord <HI>Danby</HI> re&s;olved to leave the Trea&s;ury at <HI>Lady-day.</HI> And in that time he made great advantage by &s;everal payments which he got the King to order, that were due upon &s;uch &s;light pre|tences, that it was believed he had a large &s;hare of them to him&s;elf:
<PB N="452" REF="467">
So that he left the Trea&s;ury quite empty. He per&s;uaded the King to &s;end the Duke beyond &s;ea, that &s;o there might be no colour for &s;u&s;|pecting that the coun&s;els were influenced by him. He endeavoured to per&s;uade the Duke, that it was fit for him to go out of the way. If the King and the Parliament came to an agreement, he might de|pend on the promi&s;e that the King would make him, of recalling him immediately: And if they did not agree, no part of the blame could be ca&s;t on him; which mu&s;t happen otherwi&s;e, if he &s;taid &s;till at Court. Yet no rhetorick would have prevailed on him to go, if the King had not told him po&s;itively, it was for both their &s;ervice, and &s;o it mu&s;t be done.</P>
<P>Before he went away, the King gave him all po&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke &s;ent beyond &s;ea.</NOTE> with relation to the Duke of <HI>Manmouth,</HI> who was become very po|pular, and his creatures were giving it out, that he was the King's lawful &s;on. So the King made a &s;olemn declaration in Council, and both &s;igned it and took his oath on it, that he was never married, nor contracted to that Duke's mother; nor to any other woman, except to his pre&s;ent Queen. The Duke was &s;ent away upon very &s;hort warn|ing, not without many tears &s;hed by him at parting, tho' the King &s;hed none. He went fir&s;t to <HI>Holland,</HI> and then to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> where he was but coldly received.</P>
<P>At the opening the Parliament in <HI>March,</HI> the parting with an only brother, to remove all jealou&s;y, was magnified with all the pomp of the Earl of <HI>Nottingham's</HI> eloquence. Lord <HI>Danby's</HI> friends were in &s;ome hopes, that the great &s;ervices which he had done would make matters brought again&s;t him to be handled gently. But in the manage|ment he committed &s;ome errors, that proved very unhappy to him.</P>
<P><HI>Seimour</HI> and he had fallen into &s;ome quarrellings, both being very proud and violent in their tempers. <HI>Seimour</HI> had in the la&s;t Se&s;|&s;ion &s;truck in with that heat again&s;t Popery, that he was become po|pular upon it. So he managed the matter in this new Parliament, that tho' the Court named <HI>Meres</HI> yet he was cho&s;en Speaker. The nomination of the Speaker was under&s;tood to come from the King, tho' he was not named as recommending the per&s;on. Yet a Privy Coun&s;ellor named one: And it was under&s;tood to be done by or|der. And the per&s;on thus named was put in the chair, and was next day pre&s;ented to the King, who approved the choice. When <HI>Seimour</HI> was next day pre&s;ented as the Speaker, the King refu&s;ed to confirm the election. He &s;aid, he had other occa&s;ions for him, which could not be di&s;pen&s;ed with. Upon this, great heats aro&s;e, with a long and violent debate. It was &s;aid, the Hou&s;e had the choice of their Speaker in them, and that their pre&s;enting the Speaker was only a &s;olemn &s;hewing him to the King, &s;uch as was the pre&s;enting the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs of <HI>London</HI> in the Exchequer; but that the King was bound to confirm their choice. This debate held a week, and created much anger.</P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="468">
A temper was found at la&s;t. <HI>Seimour's</HI> election was let fall: But the point was &s;ettled, that the right of electing was in the Hou&s;e, and that the confirmation was a thing of cour&s;e. So another was cho&s;en Speaker. And the Hou&s;e immediately fell on Lord <HI>Danby.</HI> Tho&s;e who intended to &s;erve him &s;aid, the heat this di&s;pute had rai&s;ed, which was imputed wholly to him, had put it out of their power to do it. But he committed other errors. He took out a pardon under the Great Seal. The Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> dur&s;t not venture to pa&s;s it. So the King ordered the Seal to be put to the pardon in his own pre&s;ence. And thus, according to Lord <HI>Nottingham's</HI> figure when he was afterwards que&s;tioned about it, it did not pa&s;s thro' the or|dinary methods of production, but was an immediate effect of his Maje&s;ty's power of creating. He al&s;o took out a warrant to be Mar|qui&s;s of <HI>Caermarthen.</HI> And the King, in a &s;peech to the Parliament, &s;aid, he had done nothing but by his order; and therefore he had pardoned him; and, if there was any defect in his pardon, he would pa&s;s it over and over again, till it &s;hould be quite legal.</P>
<P>Upon this a great debate was rai&s;ed. Some que&s;tioned whether <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Danby</HI> par|don'd by the King, but pro&s;ecuted by the Hou&s;e of Com|mons.</NOTE> the King's pardon, e&s;pecially when pa&s;&s;ed in bar to an impeachment, was good in law: This would encourage ill Mini&s;ters, who would be always &s;ure of a pardon, and &s;o would act more boldly, if they &s;aw &s;o ea&s;y a way to be &s;ecured again&s;t the danger of impeachments: The King's pardon did indeed &s;ecure one again&s;t all pro&s;ecution at his &s;uit: But, as in the ca&s;e of murder an appeal lay, from which the King's pardon did not cover the per&s;on, &s;ince the King could no more pardon the injuries done his people, than he could forgive the debts that were owing to them; &s;o from a parity of rea&s;on it was inferred, that &s;ince the offences of Mini&s;ters of State were injuries done the publick, the King's Pardon could not hinder a pro&s;ecu|tion in Parliament, which &s;eemed to be one of the chief &s;ecurities, and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of our con&s;titution. Yet on the other hand it was &s;aid, that the power of pardoning was a main article of the King's Prerogative: None had ever yet been annulled: The law had made this one of the tru&s;ts of the Government, without any limitation upon it: All arguments again&s;t it might be good rea&s;ons for the limiting it for the future: But what was already pa&s;t was good in law, and could not be broke thro'. The temper propo&s;ed was, that, upon Lord <HI>Danby's</HI> going out of the way, an Act of bani&s;hment &s;hould pa&s;s again&s;t him, like that which had pa&s;t again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Clarendon.</HI> Upon that, when the Lords voted that he &s;hould be committed, he withdrew. So a bill of bani&s;hment pa&s;&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and was &s;ent down to the Commons. <HI>Winnington</HI> fell on it there in a mo&s;t furious manner. He &s;aid, it was an Act to let all Mini&s;ters &s;ee what was the wor&s;t thing that could happen to them, after they had been engaged in the blacke&s;t de&s;igns, and
<PB N="454" REF="469">
had got great rewards of wealth and honour: All they could &s;uffer was, to be obliged to live beyond &s;ea. This enflamed the Hou&s;e &s;o, that tho&s;e, who intended to have moderated that heat, found they could not &s;top it. <HI>Littleton</HI> &s;ent for me that night, to try if it was po&s;&s;ible to mollify <HI>Winnington.</HI> We laid before him, that the King &s;eemed brought near a di&s;po&s;ition to grant every thing that could be de&s;ired of him: And why mu&s;t an attainder be brought on, which would create a breach that could not be healed? The Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> was re&s;olved to bear a bani&s;hment; but would come in, rather than be attainted, and plead his pardon: And then the King was upon the matter made the party in the pro&s;ecution, which might ruin all: We knew how bad a Mini&s;ter he had been, and had felt the ill effects of his power: But the publick was to be preferred to all other con&s;iderations. But <HI>Winnington</HI> was then &s;o entirely in <HI>Moun|tague</HI>'s management, and was &s;o blown up with popularity, and &s;o much provoked by being turned out of the place of Solicitor General, that he could not be prevailed on. It was offered afterwards from the Court, as <HI>Littleton</HI> told me, both that Lord <HI>Danby</HI> &s;hould by Act of Parliament be degraded from his Peerage, as well as bani&s;hed, and that an Act &s;hould pa&s;s declaring for the future no pardon &s;hould be pleaded in bar to an impeachment. But the fury of the time was &s;uch, that all offers were rejected. And &s;o a very probable appearance of &s;ettling the Nation was lo&s;t: For the bill for bani&s;hing Lord <HI>Dan|by</HI> was thrown out by the Commons. And in&s;tead of it a bill of attainder was brought in. The Trea&s;ury was put in commi&s;&s;ion. The Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was put at the head of it. And <HI>Hide</HI> and <HI>Godolphin</HI> were two of the commi&s;&s;ion. The Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI> was brought over from <HI>France,</HI> and made Secretary of State. And Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI> joined with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> to pre&s;s the King to change his coun&s;els, and to turn to another method of go|vernment, and to take the men of the greate&s;t credit into his con|fidence. Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was much blamed for going in &s;o early into the Court, before the re&s;t were brought in. He &s;aid to me, he did it in the pro&s;pect of working the change that was afterwards effected. Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI> al&s;o told me, that the King was ea&s;y in the bringing in Lord <HI>Sha&s;tsbury;</HI> for he thought he was only angry in revenge, becau&s;e he was not employed; but that he had &s;o ill an opinion of Lord <HI>Halli&s;ax,</HI> that it was not ea&s;y to get over that. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> told me, that he had as great difficulty in overcoming that, as ever in any thing that he &s;tudied to bring the King to.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the King was prevailed on to di&s;mi&s;s the whole Council, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Council.</NOTE> which was all made up of Lord <HI>Danby</HI>'s creatures. And the chief men of both Hou&s;es were brought into it. This was carried with &s;o much &s;ecrecy, that it was not &s;o much as &s;u&s;pected, till the day before it was done. The King was weary of the vexation he had been long
<PB N="455" REF="470">
in, and de&s;ired to be &s;et at ea&s;e. And at that time he would have done any thing to get an end put to the Plot, and to the fermentation that was now over the whole Nation: So that, if the Hou&s;e of Commons would have let the matter of Lord <HI>Danby</HI>'s pardon fall, and have accepted of limitations on his brother, in&s;tead of excluding him, he was willing to have yielded in every thing el&s;e. He put like|wi&s;e the Admiralty and Ordnance into commi&s;&s;ions: Out of all which the Duke's creatures were &s;o excluded, that they gave both him and them&s;elves for lo&s;t. But the hatred that <HI>Mountague</HI> bore Lord <HI>Danby,</HI> and Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI>'s hatred to the Duke, &s;poiled all this. There were al&s;o many in the Hou&s;e of Commons, who find|ing them&s;elves forgot, while others were preferred to them, re&s;olv|ed to make them&s;elves con&s;iderable. And they infu&s;ed into a great many a mi&s;tru&s;t of all that was doing. It was &s;aid, the King was &s;till what he was before. No change appeared in him. And all this was only an artifice to lay the heat that was in the Nation, to gain &s;o ma|ny over to him, and &s;o to draw money from the Commons. So they re&s;olved to give no money, till all other things &s;hould be fir&s;t &s;ettled. No part of the change that was then made was more acceptable than that of the Judges: For Lord <HI>Danby</HI> had brought in &s;ome &s;ad creatures to tho&s;e important po&s;ts. And <HI>Jones</HI> had the new mo|delling of the Bench. And he put in very worthy men, in the room of tho&s;e ignorant Judges that were now di&s;mi&s;s'd.</P>
<P>The main point in debate was, what &s;ecurity the King &s;hould offer <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates concerning the Exclu|&s;ion.</NOTE> to quiet the fears of the Nation upon the account of the Duke's &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion. The Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> propo&s;ed the excluding him &s;imply, and making the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to go on, as if he was dead, as the only mean that was ea&s;y and &s;afe both for the Crown and the peo|ple: This was nothing but the di&s;inheriting the next heir, which certainly the King and Parliament might do, as well as any private man might di&s;inherit his next heir, if he had a mind to it. The King would not con&s;ent to this. He had faithfully promi&s;ed the Duke, that he never would. And he thought, if Acts of Exclu&s;ion were once begun, it would not be ea&s;y to &s;top them; but that upon any di&s;content at the next heir, they would be &s;et on: religion was now the pretence: But other pretences would be found out, when there was need of them: This in&s;en&s;ibly would change the nature of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Monarchy: So that from being hereditary it would become elective. The Lords of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Hallifax</HI> upon this propo&s;ed &s;uch limitations of the Duke's authority, when the Crown &s;hould devolve on him, as would di&s;able him from doing any harm, either in Church or State: Such as the taking out of his hand all power in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, the di&s;po&s;al of the pub|lick money, with the power of peace and war, and the lodging the&s;e in both Hou&s;es of Parliament; and that whatever Parliament
<PB N="456" REF="471">
was in being, or the la&s;t that had been in being at the King's death, &s;hould meet, without a new &s;ummons, upon it, and a&s;&s;ume the admini|&s;tration of affairs. Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> argued again&s;t this, as much more prejudicial to the Crown than the exclu&s;ion of one heir: For this changed the whole Government, and &s;et up a Democracy in&s;tead of a Monarchy. Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI>'s arguing now &s;o much again&s;t the danger of turning the Monarchy to be elective, was the more extraordinary in him, becau&s;e he had made an hereditary Monarchy the &s;ubject of his mirth; and had often &s;aid, who takes a coachman to drive him, becau&s;e his father was a good coachman? Yet he was now jealous of a &s;mall &s;lip in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But at the &s;ame time he &s;tudied to infu&s;e into &s;ome a zeal for a Commonwealth. And to the&s;e he pretended, that he preferred limitations to an exclu&s;ion: Becau&s;e the one kept up the Monarchy &s;till, only pa&s;&s;ing over one per&s;on; whereas the other brought us really into a Commonwealth, as &s;oon as we had a Popi&s;h King over us. And it was &s;aid by &s;ome of his friends, that the limitations propo&s;ed were &s;o advantageous to publick liberty, that a man might be tempted to wi&s;h for a Popi&s;h King, to come at them.</P>
<P>Upon this great difference of opinion, a faction was quickly form|ed in the new Council. The Lords <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Sunderland</HI> and <HI>Hallifax</HI> declaring for limitations, and again&s;t the Exclu&s;ion; while Lord <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> now made Pre&s;ident of the Council, declared highly for it. They took much pains on him to moderate his heat: But he was become &s;o intolerably vain, that he would not mix with them, unle&s;s he might govern. So they broke with him: And the other three were called the Triumvirate. Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> applied him&s;elf to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Trea&s;ury, to the regulating the King's expence, and the improvement of the Revenue. His clear, tho' &s;low, &s;en&s;e made him very acceptable to the King. Lord <HI>Hallifax</HI> &s;tudied to manage the King's &s;pirit, and to gain an a&s;cendant there by a lively and libertine conver&s;ation. Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI> managed foreign af|fairs, and had the greate&s;t credit with the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> After it was agreed on to offer the limitations, the Lord Chancellor by order from the King made the propo&s;ition to both Hou&s;es. The Duke was &s;truck with the news of this, when it came to him to <HI>Bru&s;|&s;els.</HI> I &s;aw a letter writ by his Duche&s;s the next po&s;t: In which &s;he wrote, that as for all the high things that were &s;aid by their enemies they looked for them, but that &s;peech of the Lord Chancellor's was a &s;urprize, and a great mortification to them. Their apprehen&s;ions of that did not hang long upon them. The Exclu&s;ion was become the popular expedient. So, after much debating, a bill was ordered for excluding the Duke of <HI>York.</HI> I will give you here a &s;hort ab&s;tract of all that was &s;aid, both within and without doors, for and again&s;t the Exclu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="457" REF="472">
Tho&s;e who argued for it laid it down for a foundation, that every per&s;on, who had the whole right of any thing in him, had likewi&s;e the power of transferring it to whom he plea&s;ed. So the King and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments u&s;ed for and again&s;t the Exclu&s;ion.</NOTE> Parliament, being entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the whole authority of the Na|tion, had a power to limit the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and every thing el&s;e relating to the Nation, as they plea&s;ed. And by con&s;equence there was no &s;uch thing as a fundamental law, by which the power of Parliament was bound up: For no King and Parliament in any former age had a power over the pre&s;ent King and Parliament; otherwi&s;e the Govern|ment was not entire, nor ab&s;olute. A father, how much &s;oever deter|mined by nature to provide for his children, yet had certainly a power of di&s;inheriting them, without which, in &s;ome ca&s;es, the re&s;pect due to him could not be pre&s;erved. The life of the King on the throne was not &s;ecure, unle&s;s this was acknowledged. For if the next heir was a traitor, and could not be &s;eized on, the King would be ill &s;erved in oppo&s;ition to him, if he could not bar his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by an exclu&s;ion. Government was appointed for tho&s;e that were to be governed, and not for the &s;ake of Governors them&s;elves: Therefore all things relating to it were to be mea&s;ured by the publick intere&s;t, and the &s;afety of the people. In none of God's appointments in the Old Te&s;tament regard was had to the elde&s;t. <HI>I&s;aac, Jacob, Judah, Ephraim,</HI> and more particularly <HI>Solomon,</HI> were preferred without any regard to the next in line. In the &s;everal Kingdoms of <HI>Europe</HI> the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion went according to particular laws, and not by any general law. In <HI>England, Spain</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> the heir general did &s;ucceed: Whereas it was only the heir male in <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI> And whereas the oath of allegiance tied us to the King and his heirs, the word heir was a term that imported that per&s;on who by law ought to &s;ucceed: And &s;o it fell by law to any per&s;on who was declared next in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. In <HI>England</HI> the heir of the King that reigned had been &s;ometimes &s;et a&s;ide, and the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion transferred to ano|ther per&s;on. <HI>Henry</HI> VII. &s;et up his title on his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Crown. <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. got his two daughters, while they were by acts of Parlia|ment illegitimated, put in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: And he had a power given him to devi&s;e it after them, and their i&s;&s;ue, at his plea&s;ure. Queen <HI>Eli|zabeth,</HI> when &s;he was in danger from the practices of the Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> got an Act to pa&s;s a&s;&s;erting the power of the Parliament to limit the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown. It was high trea&s;on to deny this during her life, and was &s;till highly penal to this day. All this was laid down in general, to a&s;&s;ert a power in the Parliament to exclude the next heir, if there was a ju&s;t cau&s;e for it. Now, as to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the Popi&s;h religion was &s;o contrary to the whole frame and con&s;titution of our Government, as well as to that dignity inherent in the Crown, of being the head of the Church, that a Papi&s;t &s;eemed to be brought under a di&s;ability to hold the Crown. A great part of the property of the Na|tion, the Abbey lands, was &s;haken by the pro&s;pect of &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion.
<PB N="458" REF="473">
The perfidy and the cruelty of that religion made the danger more &s;en&s;ible. Fires, and Courts of Inqui&s;ition, were that which all mu&s;t reckon for, who would not redeem them&s;elves by an early and zealous conver&s;ion. The Duke's own temper was much in&s;i&s;ted on. It appeared by all their letters, how much the Papi&s;ts depended on him: And his own deportment &s;hewed, there was good rea&s;on for it. He would break thro' all limitations, and call in a foreign power, ra|ther than &s;ubmit to them. Some mercenary lawyers would give it for law, that the prerogative could not be limited, and that a law limiting it was void of it &s;elf. Revenges for pa&s;t injuries, when join'd to a bi|gotry in religion, would be probably very violent.</P>
<P>On the other hand, &s;ome argued again&s;t the Exclu&s;ion: That it was unlawful in it &s;elf, and again&s;t the unalterable law of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; (which came to be the common phra&s;e.) Monarchy was &s;aid to be by divine right: So the Law could not alter what God had &s;ettled. Yet few went at fir&s;t &s;o high. Much weight was laid on the oath of allegi|ance, that tied us to the King's heirs: And who&s;o was the heir when any man took that oath, was &s;till the heir to him. All lawyers had great regard to fundamental laws. And it was a maxim among our lawyers, that even an Act of Parliament again&s;t <HI>Magna Charta</HI> was null of it &s;elf. There was no arguing from the changes in the cour&s;e of the Succe&s;&s;ion. The&s;e had been the effects of pro&s;perous rebellions. Nor from <HI>Henry</HI> VII. 's reigning in the right of his Queen, and yet not owning it to be &s;o. Nor was it &s;trange, if in &s;o violent a reign as <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. 's acts were made in prejudice of the right of blood. But tho' his daughters were made ba&s;tards by two &s;everal acts, yet it was notorious they were both born in a &s;tate of marriage. And when unlawful marriages were annulled, yet &s;uch i&s;&s;ue as de&s;cended from them <HI>bona fide</HI> u&s;ed not to be illegitimated. But tho' that King made a will pur&s;uant to an act of Parliament, excluding the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> line, yet &s;uch regard the Nation had to the next in blood, that, without examin|ing the will, the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> line was receiv'd. It is true, Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> out of her hatred to the Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> got the famed act to pa&s;s, that declares the Parliament's power of limiting the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But &s;ince that whole matter ended &s;o fatally, and was the great blemi&s;h of her reign, it was not rea&s;onable to build much on it. The&s;e were the ar|guments of tho&s;e, who thought the Parliament had not the power to enact an exclu&s;ion of the next heir: Of which opinion the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was at this time. Others did not go on the&s;e grounds: But they &s;aid, that tho' a father has indeed a power of di&s;inheriting his &s;on, yet he ought never to exert it but upon a ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ion. It was not yet legally certain, that the Duke was a Papi&s;t. This was a con|demning him unheard. A man's con&s;cience was not even in his own power. It &s;eemed therefore to be an unju&s;tifiable &s;everity, to cut off &s;o great a right only for a point of opinion. It is true, it might be rea&s;on|able to &s;ecure the Nation from the ill effects that opinion might have
<PB N="459" REF="474">
upon them, which was fully done by the limitations. But it was unju&s;t to carry it further. The Prote&s;tants had charged the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> heavily for the League of <HI>France,</HI> in order to the excluding the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bourbon</HI> from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> becau&s;e of he|re&s;y: And this would make the charge return back upon us, to our &s;hame. In the ca&s;e of infancy, or lunacy, guardians were a&s;&s;igned: But the right was &s;till in the true heir. A Popi&s;h Prince was con&s;idered as in that &s;tate: And the&s;e limitations were like the a&s;&s;igning him guar|dians. The Crown had been for &s;everal ages limited in the power of rai&s;ing money; to which it may be &s;uppo&s;ed a high &s;pirited King did not ea&s;ily &s;ubmit, and yet we had long maintained this: And might it not be hoped, the limitations propo&s;ed might be maintained in one reign; chiefly con&s;idering the zeal and the number of tho&s;e who were concerned to &s;upport them? Other Princes might think them&s;elves obliged in honour and religion to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, if he was quite excluded: And it might be the occa&s;ion of a new Popi&s;h League, that might be fatal to the whole Prote&s;tant intere&s;t. Whereas, if the limitations pa&s;t, other Princes would not &s;o probably enter into the laws and e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;ettled among us. It was &s;aid, many in the Nation thought the Exclu&s;ion unlawful: But all would jointly concur in the limitations: So this was the &s;ecure&s;t way, that comprehended the greate&s;t part of the Nation: And probably <HI>Scotland</HI> would not go into the Exclu&s;ion, but merit at the Duke's hands by a&s;&s;erting his title: So here was a foundation of war round about us, as well as of great di|&s;tractions among our &s;elves: Some regard was to be had to the King's honour, who had &s;o often declared, he would not con&s;ent to an Exclu|&s;ion; but would to any limitations, how hard &s;oever.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the chief arguments upon which this debate was ma|naged. For my own part, I did always look on it as a wild and extrava|gant conceit, to deny the lawfulne&s;s of an Exclu&s;ion in any ca&s;e what&s;o|ever. But for a great while I thought the accepting the limitations was the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t method. I &s;aw the driving on the Exclu&s;ion would probably throw us into great confu&s;ions. And therefore I made u&s;e of all the credit I had with many in both Hou&s;es, to divert them from pur&s;uing it, as they did, with &s;uch eagerne&s;s, that they would hearken to nothing el&s;e. Yet, when I &s;aw the party &s;o deeply engaged, and &s;o vi|olently &s;et upon it, both <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> and I, who thought we had &s;ome inte|re&s;t in Lord <HI>Hallifax,</HI> took great pains on him, to divert him from op|po&s;ing it &s;o furiou&s;ly as he did: For he became as it were the cham|pion again&s;t the Exclu&s;ion. I fore&s;aw a great breach was like to fol|low. And that was plainly the game of Popery, to keep us in &s;uch an un&s;ettled &s;tate. This was like either to end in a rebellion, or in an abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the Nation to the humours of the Court. I con|fe&s;s, that which I apprehended mo&s;t was rebellion, tho' it turned after|wards quite the other way&punc; But men of more experience, and who had
<PB N="460" REF="475">
better advantages to make a true judgment of the temper of the Na|tion, were mi&s;taken as well as my &s;elf. All the progre&s;s that was made in this matter in the pre&s;ent Parliament was, that the bill of Exclu&s;ion was read twice in the Hou&s;e of Commons. But the Parliament was di&s;|&s;olved before it came to a third reading.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Danby</HI>'s pro&s;ecution was the point on which the Par|liament <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Danby</HI>'s pro|&s;ecution.</NOTE> was broken. The bill of attainder for his wilful ab&s;ence was pa&s;s'd by the Commons, and &s;ent up to the Lords. But, when it was brought to the third reading, he delivered him&s;elf; and was upon that &s;ent to the Tower: Upon which he moved for his trial. The man of the law he depended mo&s;t upon was <HI>Pollexfen,</HI> an hone&s;t, and learned, but perplexed lawyer. He advi&s;ed him po&s;itively to &s;tand upon his pardon. It was a point of prerogative never yet judged again&s;t the Crown: So he might in that ca&s;e depend upon the Hou&s;e of Lords, and on the King's intere&s;t there. It might perhaps produce &s;ome Act again&s;t all pardons for the future. But he thought he was &s;ecure in his pardon. It was both wi&s;er, and more honourable, for the King, as well as for him&s;elf, to &s;tand on this, than to enter into the matter of the letters, which would occa&s;ion many indecent reflections on both. So he &s;ettled on this, and pleaded his pardon at the Lord's bar: To which the Commons put in a reply, que&s;tioning the validity of the pardon, on the grounds formerly mentioned. And they demanded a trial and judgment.</P>
<P>Upon this a famous debate aro&s;e, concerning the Bi&s;hops right of voting in any part of a trial for trea&s;on. It was &s;aid, that, tho' the Bi&s;hops did not vote in the final judgment, yet they had a right to vote in all preliminaries. Now the allowing, or not allowing the par|don to be good, was but a preliminary: And yet the whole matter was concluded by it. The Lords <HI>Nottingham</HI> and <HI>Roberts</HI> argued for the Bi&s;hops voting. But the Lords <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Shaftsbury,</HI> and <HI>Hollis,</HI> were again&s;t it. Many books were writ on both &s;ides, of which an account &s;hall be given afterwards. But upon this debate it was carried by the majority, that the Bi&s;hops had a right to vote. Upon which the Commons &s;aid, they would not proceed, unle&s;s the Bi&s;hops were obliged to withdraw during the whole trial. And upon that breach be|tween the two Hou&s;es the Parliament was prorogued: And &s;oon after it was di&s;&s;olved. And the blame of this was ca&s;t chiefly on the Bi&s;hops. The truth was, they de&s;ired to have withdrawn, but the King would not &s;uffer it. He was &s;o &s;et on maintaining the pardon, that he would not venture &s;uch a point on the votes of the temporal Lords. And he told the Bi&s;hops, they mu&s;t &s;tick to him, and to his prerogative, as they would expect that he &s;hould &s;tick to them, if they came to be pu&s;h'd at. By this means they were expo&s;ed to the popular fury.</P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="476">
Hot people began every where to cen&s;ure them, as a &s;et of men that for their own ends, and for every punctilio that they pretended to, would expo&s;e the Nation and the Prote&s;tant Religi|on <NOTE PLACE="marg">A great heat rai&s;ed again&s;t the Clergy.</NOTE> to ruin. And in revenge for this many began to declare open|ly in favour of the Non-conformi&s;ts: And upon this the Non|conformi&s;ts behaved them&s;elves very indecently. For, tho' many of the more moderate of the Clergy were trying if an ad|vantage might be taken from the ill &s;tate we were in to heal tho&s;e breaches that were among us, they on their part fell very &s;everely upon the body of the Clergy. The act that re|&s;trained the pre&s;s was to la&s;t only to the end of the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the next Parliament that &s;hould meet after that was di&s;|&s;olved. So now, upon the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, the act not be|ing revived, the pre&s;s was open: And it became very licenti|ous, both again&s;t the Court and the Clergy. And in this the Non-conformi&s;ts had &s;o great a hand, that the Bi&s;hops and Clergy, apprehending that a rebellion, and with it the pul|ling the Church to pieces, was de&s;igned, &s;et them&s;elves on the other hand to write again&s;t the late times, and to draw a parallel between the pre&s;ent times and them: Which was not decently enough managed by tho&s;e who undertook the argu|ment, and who were believed to be &s;et on, and paid by the Court for it. The chief manager of all tho&s;e angry writings was <NOTE PLACE="marg">The occa&s;i|ons that fo|mented that heat.</NOTE> one Sir <HI>Roger L'E&s;trange,</HI> a man who had lived in all the late times, and was furni&s;hed with many pa&s;&s;ages, and an unex|hau&s;ted copiou&s;ne&s;s in writing: So that for four years he pub|li&s;hed three or four &s;heets a week under the title of the Ob|&s;ervator, all tending to defame the contrary party, and to make the Clergy apprehend that their ruin was de&s;igned. This had all the &s;ucce&s;s he could have wi&s;hed, as it drew con&s;idera|ble &s;ums that were rai&s;ed to acknowledge the &s;ervice he did. Upon this the greater part of the Clergy, who were al|ready much prejudiced again&s;t that party, being now both &s;harpned and furni&s;hed by the&s;e papers, delivered them&s;elves up to much heat and indi&s;cretion, which was vented both in their pulpits and common conver&s;ation, and mo&s;t particularly, at the elections of parliament men: And this drew much ha|tred and cen&s;ure upon them. They &s;eemed now to lay down all fears and apprehen&s;ions of Popery: And nothing was &s;o common in their mouths as the year forty one, in which the late wars begun, and which &s;eemed now to be near the be|ing acted over again. Both City and Country were full of many indecencies that broke out on this occa&s;ion. But, as there were too many of the Clergy whom the heat of their
<PB N="462" REF="477">
tempers and the hope of preferment drove to &s;uch extrava|gancies, &s;o there were &s;till many worthy and eminent men a|mong them, who&s;e lives and labours did in a great mea&s;ure re&s;cue the Church from tho&s;e reproaches that the follies of others drew upon it. Such were, be&s;ides tho&s;e whom I have often named, <HI>Tenni&s;on, Sharp, Patrick, Sherlock, Fowler, Scot, Calamy, Claget, Cudworth,</HI> two <HI>Mores, Williams,</HI> and many others, whom tho' I knew not &s;o particularly as to give all their Characters, yet they de&s;erved a high one; and were in|deed an honour, both to the Church, and to the age in which they lived.</P>
<P>I return from this digre&s;&s;ion to give an account of the ar|guments <NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments for and a|gain&s;t the Bi|&s;hops voting in the preli|minaries in trials of trea&s;on.</NOTE> by which that debate concerning the Bi&s;hops vo|ting in preliminaries was maintained. It was &s;aid, the Bi|&s;hops were one of Three E&s;tates of which the Parliament was compo&s;ed, and that therefore they ought to have a &s;hare in all parliamentary matters: That as the temporal Lords tran&s;|mitted their honours and fees to their heirs, &s;o the Bi&s;hops did tran&s;mit theirs to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors: And they &s;at in Parlia|ment, both as they were the Prelates of the Church and Ba|rons of the Realm: But in the time of Popery, when they had a mind to withdraw them&s;elves wholly from the King's Courts, and re&s;olved to form them&s;elves into a &s;tate apart, upon this attempt of theirs, our Kings would not di&s;pen&s;e with their attendance: And then &s;everal regulations were made, chiefly the famed ones at <HI>Clarendon;</HI> not &s;o much intended as re&s;traints on them in the u&s;e of their rights as they were Barons, as obligations on them to perform all but tho&s;e that in compli|ance with their de&s;ires were then excepted: The Clergy, who had a mind to be excu&s;ed from all parliamentary attendance, obtained leave to withdraw in judgments of life and death, as unbecoming their profe&s;&s;ion and contrary to their Canons. Princes were the more inclinable to this, becau&s;e Bi&s;hops might be more apt to lean to the merciful &s;ide: And the judgments of Parliament in that time were commonly in fa|vour of the Crown again&s;t the Barons: So the Bi&s;hops had leave given them to withdraw from the&s;e: But they had a right to name a proxy for the Clergy, or to prote&s;t for &s;aving their rights in all other points as Peers: So that this was ra|ther a conce&s;&s;ion in their favour than a re&s;traint impo&s;ed on them: And they did it on de&s;ign to get out of the&s;e Courts as much as they could: At the Reformation all &s;uch prac|tices as were contrary to the King's prerogative were con|demned: So it was &s;aid, that the King having a right by
<PB N="463" REF="478">
his prerogative to demand ju&s;tice in Parliament again&s;t &s;uch as he &s;hould accu&s;e there, none of the Peers could be excu&s;ed from that by any of the con&s;titutions made in the time of Popery, which were all condemned at the Reformation: The prote&s;ta|tion they made in their a&s;king leave to withdraw &s;hewed it was a voluntary act of theirs, and not impo&s;ed on them by the law of Parliament: The words of the article of <HI>Clarendon</HI> &s;eemed to import, that they might &s;it during the trial, till it came to the final judgment and &s;entence of life or limb; and by con&s;equence that they might vote in the preliminaries.</P>
<P>On the other hand it was argued, that Bi&s;hops could not judge the temporal Lords as their Peers: For if they were to be tried for high trea&s;on, they were to be judged only by a jury of Commoners: And &s;ince their honour was not he|reditary, they could not be the Peers of tho&s;e who&s;e blood was dignified: And therefore, tho' they were a part of that Hou&s;e with relation to the legi&s;lature and judicature, yet the difference between a per&s;onal and hereditary Peerage made that they could not be the judges of the temporal Lords, as not being to be tried by them: The cu&s;tom of Parliament was the law of Parliament: And &s;ince they had never judged in the&s;e ca&s;es, they could not pretend to it: Their pro|te&s;tations was only in barr to the Lords doing any thing be&s;ides the trial during the time that they were withdrawn: The words of the article of <HI>Clarendon</HI> mu&s;t relate to the whole trial as one complicated thing, tho' it might run out into many branches: And &s;ince the final &s;entence did often turn upon the preliminaries, the voting in the&s;e was upon the matter the vo|ting in the final &s;entence: Whatever might be the fir&s;t in|ducements to frame tho&s;e articles of the Clergy, which at this di&s;tance mu&s;t be dark and uncertain, yet the laws and practice pur&s;uant to them were &s;till in force: By the act of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth it was provided, that, till a new body of canon law &s;hould be formed, that which was then received &s;hould be &s;till in force, unle&s;s it was contrary to the King's prerogative or the law of the land: And it was a remote and forced inference to pretend that the prerogative was concerned in this matter.</P>
<P>Thus the point was argued on both &s;ides. Dr. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Stillingfleet</HI> wrote on this point.</NOTE> gave upon this occa&s;ion a great proof of his being able to make him&s;elf the ma&s;ter of any argument which he undertook: For after the lawyers, and others conver&s;ant in Parliament records, in particular the Lord <HI>Hollis</HI> who undertook the ar|gument with great vehemence, had writ many books about it, he publi&s;hed a treati&s;e that di&s;covered more &s;kill and exactne&s;s
<PB N="464" REF="479">
in judging tho&s;e matters than all that had gone before him. And indeed he put an end to the controver&s;y in the opinion of all impartial men. He proved the right that the Bi&s;hops had to vote in tho&s;e preliminaries, beyond contradic|tion in my opinion, both from our records, and from our con&s;titution. But now in the interval of Parliament other mat|ters come to be related.</P>
<P>The King upon the prorogation of the Parliament became &s;ul|len <NOTE PLACE="marg">The trial of five <HI>Je&s;uits.</HI></NOTE> and thoughtful: He &s;aw, he had to do with a &s;trange &s;ort of people, that could neither be managed nor frightned: And from that time his temper was ob&s;erved to change very vi&s;ibly. He &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of calling another Parliament, and of preparing mat|ters in order to it: Therefore the pro&s;ecution of the plot was &s;till carried on. So five of the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> that had been accu&s;ed of it were brought to their trial: They were <HI>Whitebread</HI> their Pro|vincial, <HI>Fenwick, Harcourt, Govan,</HI> and <HI>Turner. Oates</HI> repeat|ed again&s;t them his former evidence: And they prepared a great defence again&s;t it: For &s;ixteen per&s;ons came over from their Hou&s;e at St. <HI>Omers,</HI> who te&s;tified that <HI>Oates</HI> had &s;taid among them all the while from <HI>December</HI> &s;eventy &s;even till <HI>June</HI> &s;eventy eight; &s;o that he could not po&s;&s;ibly be at <HI>London</HI> in the <HI>April</HI> between at tho&s;e con&s;ultations, as he had &s;worn. They re|membred this the more particularly, becau&s;e he &s;at at the table by him&s;elf in the refectory, which made his being there to be the more ob&s;erved; for as he was not mixed with the &s;cho|lars &s;o neither was he admitted to the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> table. They &s;aid, he was among them every day, except one or two in which he was in the infirmary: They al&s;o te&s;tified, that &s;ome of tho&s;e who he &s;wore came over with him into <HI>England</HI> in <HI>April</HI> had &s;taid all that &s;ummer in <HI>Flanders.</HI> In oppo&s;ition to this <HI>Oates</HI> had found out &s;even or eight per&s;ons who depo&s;ed that they &s;aw him in <HI>England</HI> about the beginning of <HI>May;</HI> and that he being known formerly to them in a Clergyman's habit, they had ob&s;erved him &s;o much the more by rea&s;on of that change of habit. With one of the&s;e he dined; and he had much di&s;cour&s;e with him about his travels. An old Domi|nican <HI>Frier,</HI> who was &s;till of that Church and Order, &s;wore al|&s;o that he &s;aw him, and &s;poke frequently with him at that time: By this the credit of the St. <HI>Omer</HI>'s &s;cholars was quite bla&s;ted. There was no rea&s;on to mi&s;tru&s;t tho&s;e who had no intere&s;t in the matter, and &s;wore that they &s;aw <HI>Oates</HI> about that time; whereas the evidence given by &s;cholars bred in the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> college, when it was to &s;ave &s;ome of their Order, was liable to a very ju&s;t &s;u&s;picion. <HI>Bedlow</HI> now &s;wore again&s;t them
<PB N="465" REF="480">
all, not upon hear&s;ay as before, but on his own knowledge; and no regard was had to his former Oath mentioned in <HI>Ire|land</HI>'s trial. <HI>Dugdale</HI> did likewi&s;e &s;wear again&s;t &s;ome of them: One part of his evidence &s;eemed &s;carce credible. He &s;wore, that <HI>Whitebread</HI> did in a letter that was directed to him&s;elf, tho' intend|ed for <HI>F. Evers,</HI> and that came to him by the common po&s;t, and was &s;igned by <HI>Whitebread,</HI> de&s;ire him to find out men proper to be made u&s;e of in killing the King, of what quality &s;oever they might be. This did not look like the cunning of <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> in an age, in which all people made u&s;e either of cyphers, or of &s;ome di&s;gui&s;ed cant. But the overthrowing the St. <HI>Omers</HI> evidence was now &s;uch an additional load on the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> that the jury came quickly to a verdict; and they were condemned. At their execution they did with the greate&s;t &s;olemnity, and the deepe&s;t imprecations po&s;&s;ible, deny the whole evidence up|on which they were condemned: And prote&s;ted, that they held no opinions either of the lawfulne&s;s of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating Princes, or of the Pope's power of depo&s;ing them, and that they counted all equivocation odious and &s;inful. All their &s;peeches were very full of the&s;e heads. <HI>Govan</HI>'s was much laboured, and too rhetorical. A very zealous Prote&s;tant, that went oft to &s;ee them in pri&s;on, told me, that they behaved them&s;elves with great decency, and with all the appearances both of in|nocence and devotion.</P>
<P><HI>Langhorn,</HI> the lawyer, was tried next: He made u&s;e of the St. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Langhorn</HI>'s Trial.</NOTE> <HI>Omer</HI>'s &s;cholars: But their evidence &s;eemed to be &s;o baffled, that it &s;erved him in no &s;tead. He in&s;i&s;ted next on &s;ome con|tradictions in the &s;everal depo&s;itions that <HI>Oates</HI> had given at &s;everal trials: But he had no other evidence of that be&s;ides the printed trials, which was no proof in law. The Judges &s;aid upon this, (that which is perhaps good in law, but yet does not &s;atisfy a man's mind,) that great difference was to be made between a narrative upon oath, and an evidence given in Court. If a man was fal&s;e in any one oath, there &s;eemed to be ju&s;t rea&s;on to &s;et him a&s;ide, as no good witne&s;s. <HI>Langhorn</HI> likewi&s;e urged this, that it was &s;ix weeks after <HI>Oates</HI>'s fir&s;t di&s;|covery before he named him: Whereas, if the commi&s;&s;ions had been lodged with him, he ought to have been &s;eized on and &s;earched fir&s;t of all. <HI>Bedlow</HI> &s;wore, he &s;aw him enter &s;ome of <HI>Coleman</HI>'s trea&s;onable letters in a regi&s;ter, in which expre&s;s men|tion was made of killing the King. He &s;hewed the improba|bility of this, that a man of his bu&s;ine&s;s could be &s;et to regi&s;ter letters. Yet all was of no u&s;e to him; for he was ca&s;t. Great pains was taken to per&s;uade him to di&s;cover all he knew; and
<PB N="466" REF="481">
his execution was delayed for &s;ome weeks, in hopes that &s;ome|what might be drawn from him. He offered a di&s;covery of the e&s;tates and &s;tock that the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> had in <HI>England,</HI> the &s;ecret of which was lodged with him: But he prote&s;ted, that he could make no other di&s;covery; and per&s;i&s;ted in this to his death. He &s;pent the time, in which his execution was re&s;pited, in writing &s;ome very devout and well compo&s;ed meditations. <NOTE PLACE="marg">And death.</NOTE> He was in all re&s;pects a very extraordinary man: He was learn|ed, and hone&s;t in his Profe&s;&s;ion; but was out of mea&s;ure bigotted in his religion. He died with great con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>The&s;e executions, with the denials of all that &s;uffered, made great impre&s;&s;ions on many. Several books were writ, to &s;hew that lying for a good end was not only thought lawful among them, but had been often practi&s;ed, particularly by &s;ome of tho&s;e who died for the gunpowder trea&s;on, denying tho&s;e very things which were afterwards not only fully proved, but confe&s;&s;ed by the per&s;ons concerned in them: Yet the behaviour, and la&s;t words, of tho&s;e who &s;uffered made im|pre&s;&s;ions which no books could carry off.</P>
<P>Some months after this one <HI>Serjeant,</HI> a &s;ecular Prie&s;t, who had been always in ill terms with the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> and was a zea|lous Papi&s;t in his own way, appeared before the Council upon &s;ecurity given him; and he averred, that <HI>Govan,</HI> the <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> who died prote&s;ting he had never thought it lawful to murder Kings, but had always dete&s;ted it, had at his la&s;t being in <HI>Flanders</HI> &s;aid to a very devout per&s;on, from whom <HI>Ser|jeant</HI> had it, that he thought the Queen might lawfully take away the King's life for the injuries he had done her, but much more becau&s;e he was a heretick. Upon that <HI>Serjeant</HI> run out into many particulars, to &s;hew how little credit was due to the prote&s;tations made by <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> even at their death. This gave &s;ome credit to the tendere&s;t part of <HI>Oates</HI>'s evi|dence with relation to the Queen. It &s;hewed, that the trying to do it by her means had been thought of by them. All this was only evidence from &s;econd hand: So it &s;ignified little. <HI>Ser|jeant</HI> was much blamed for it by all his own &s;ide. He had the reputation of a &s;incere and good, but of an indi&s;creet, man. The executions were generally imputed to Lord <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> who drove them on in hopes that &s;ome one or other to have &s;aved him&s;elf would have accu&s;ed the Duke. But by the&s;e the credit of the witne&s;&s;es, and of the whole plot, was &s;inking apace. The building &s;o much, and &s;hedding &s;o much blood, upon the weake&s;t part of it, which was the credit of the wit|ne&s;&s;es, rai&s;ed a general prejudice again&s;t it all; and took away

the force of that, which was certainly true, that the whole party had been contriving a change of religion by a foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;o that it made not impre&s;&s;ion enough, but went off too fa&s;t. It was like the letting blood, (as one ob&s;erved,) which abates a fever. Every execution, like a new bleeding, abated the heat that the Nation was in; and threw us into a cold deadne&s;s, which was like to prove fatal to us.</P>
<P><HI>Wakeman</HI>'s trial came on next. <HI>Oates</HI> &s;wore, he &s;aw him write <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wakeman</HI>'s trial.</NOTE> a bill to <HI>A&s;hby</HI> the <HI>Je&s;uit,</HI> by which he knew his hand: And he &s;aw another letter of his writ in the &s;ame hand, in which he directed <HI>A&s;hby,</HI> who was then going to the <HI>Bath,</HI> to u&s;e a milk diet, and to be pump'd at the <HI>Bath;</HI> and that in that letter he mentioned his zeal in the de&s;ign of killing the King. He next repeated all the &s;tory he had &s;worn a|gain&s;t the Queen: Which he brought only to make it probable that <HI>Wakeman,</HI> who was her phy&s;ician, was in it. To all this <HI>Wakeman</HI> objected, that at fir&s;t <HI>Oates</HI> accu&s;ed him only upon hear&s;ay: And did &s;olemnly prote&s;t he knew nothing a|gain&s;t him: Which was fully made out. So he &s;aid, all that <HI>Oates</HI> now &s;wore again&s;t him mu&s;t be a forgery not thought of at that time. He al&s;o proved by his own &s;ervant, and by the apothecary at the <HI>Bath,</HI> that <HI>A&s;hby</HI>'s paper was not writ, but only dictated by him: For he hapned to be very weary when he came for it, and his man wrote it out: And that of the milk diet was a plain indication of an ill laid forgery, &s;ince it was known that nothing was held more incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Bath</HI> water than milk. <HI>Bedlow</HI> &s;wore again&s;t him, that he &s;aw him re|ceive a bill of 2000 <HI>l.</HI> from <HI>Harcourt</HI> in part of a greater &s;um; and that <HI>Wakeman</HI> told him afterwards that he had received the money; and that <HI>Harcourt</HI> told him for what end it was given, for they intended the King &s;hould be killed, either by tho&s;e they &s;ent to <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> or by <HI>Wakeman</HI>'s means: And, if all other ways failed, they would take him off at <HI>New|market. Bedlow</HI> in the fir&s;t giving his evidence depo&s;ed, that this was &s;aid by <HI>Harcourt</HI> when <HI>Wakeman</HI> was gone out of the room. But ob&s;erving, by the que&s;tions that were put him, that this would not affect <HI>Wakeman,</HI> he &s;wore afterwards, that he &s;aid it likewi&s;e in his hearing. <HI>Wakeman</HI> had nothing to &s;et again&s;t all this, but that it &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible that he could tru&s;t him&s;elf in &s;uch matters to &s;uch a per&s;on: And if <HI>Oates</HI> was &s;et a&s;ide, he was but one witne&s;s. Three other Bene|dictin Prie&s;ts were tried with <HI>Wakeman. Oates</HI> &s;wore, that they were in the plot of killing the King; that one of them, being their Superior, had engaged to give 6000 <HI>l.</HI> towards
<PB N="468" REF="483">
the carrying it on. <HI>Bedlow</HI> &s;wore &s;omewhat circum&s;tantial to the &s;ame purpo&s;e again&s;t two of them: But that did not ri&s;e up to be trea&s;on: And he had nothing to charge the third with. They proved, that another per&s;on had been their Su|perior for &s;everal years; and that <HI>Oates</HI> was never once &s;uffer|ed to come within their hou&s;e, which all their &s;ervants de|po&s;ed. And they al&s;o proved, that when <HI>Oates</HI> came into their hou&s;e the night after he made his di&s;covery, and took <HI>Pickering</HI> out of his bed, and &s;aw them, he &s;aid, he had no|thing to lay to their charge. They urged many other things to de&s;troy the credit of the witne&s;&s;es: And one of them made a long declamation, in a high bomba&s;t &s;train, to &s;hew what credit was due to the &s;peeches of dying men. The eloquence was &s;o forced and childi&s;h, that this did them more hurt than good. <HI>Scroggs</HI> &s;ummed up the evidence very favourably for the pri&s;oners, far contrary to his former practice. The truth is, that this was looked on, as the Queen's trial, as well as <HI>Wakeman</HI>'s. The pri&s;oners were acquitted: And now the <NOTE PLACE="marg">He was ac|quitted.</NOTE> witne&s;&s;es &s;aw they were bla&s;ted. And they were enraged upon it; which they vented with much &s;pite upon <HI>Scroggs.</HI> And there was in him matter enough to work on for &s;uch foul mouthed people as they were. The Queen got a man of great Quality to be &s;ent over Amba&s;&s;ador from <HI>Portugal,</HI> not knowing how much &s;he might &s;tand in need of &s;uch a pro|tection. He went next day with great &s;tate to thank <HI>Scroggs</HI> for his behaviour in this trial. If he meant well in this com|plement, it was very unadvi&s;edly done: For the Chief Ju&s;tice was expo&s;ed to much cen&s;ure by it. And therefore &s;ome thought it was a &s;hew of civility done on de&s;ign to ruin him. For, how well plea&s;ed &s;oever the Papi&s;ts were with the &s;ucce&s;s of this trial, and with <HI>Scrogg</HI>'s management, yet they could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o &s;atisfied with him, as to forgive his behaviour in the former trials, which had been very inde|cently partial and violent.</P>
<P>It was now debated in Council whether the Parliament, now <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates a|bout di&s;&s;olv|ing the Par|liament.</NOTE> prorogued, &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved, or not. The King prevailed on the Lords of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Halifax</HI> to be for a di&s;&s;olution, promi&s;ing to call another Parliament next winter. Almo&s;t all the new Coun|&s;ellors were again&s;t the di&s;&s;olution. They &s;aid, the Crown had never gained any thing by di&s;&s;olving a Parliament in an|ger: The &s;ame men would probably be cho&s;en again, while all that were thought favourable to the Court would be bla&s;ted, and for the mo&s;t part &s;et a&s;ide. The new men thus cho&s;en, being fretted by a di&s;&s;olution, and put to the charge and trou|ble

of a new election, they thought the next Parliament would be more unea&s;y to the King than this if continued. Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Halifax</HI> on the other hand argued, that &s;ince the King was fixed in his re&s;olutions, both with relation to the Exclu&s;ion and to the Lord <HI>Danby</HI>'s pardon, his Parliament had engaged &s;o far in both the&s;e, that they could not think that the&s;e would be let fall: Whereas a new Parliament, tho' compo&s;ed of the &s;ame members, not being yet engaged, might be per&s;uaded to take other methods. The King followed this advice, which he had directed him&s;elf: Two or three days after, Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> was made an Earl, which was called the reward of his good coun&s;el. And now the hatred between the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> and him broke out into many violent and indecent in&s;tances. On Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI>'s &s;ide more an|ger appeared, and more contempt on Lord <HI>Halifax</HI>'s. Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was a &s;ofter man, and bore the cen&s;ure of the party more mildly: He &s;aw how he was cried out on for his la&s;t advice: But as he was not apt to be much heated, &s;o all he &s;aid to me upon it was, that he knew he was on a good bot|tom, and that good intentions would di&s;cover them&s;elves, and be ju&s;tified by all in conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>I now put a &s;top in the further relation of affairs in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The affairs of <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> to give an account of what pa&s;t in <HI>Scotland.</HI> The party again&s;t Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> had lo&s;t all hopes, &s;eeing how af|fairs were carried in the la&s;t convention of E&s;tates: But they began to take heart upon this great turn in <HI>England.</HI> The Duke was &s;ent away, and the Lord <HI>Danby</HI> was in the Tower, who were that Duke's chief &s;upports: And when the new council was &s;ettled, Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> and many others were encouraged to come up and accu&s;e him. The truth was, the King found his memory was failing him; and &s;o he re|&s;olved to let him fall gently, and bring all <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> affairs into the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s hands. The <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Lords were de&s;ired, not only by the King, but by the new Mini&s;ters, to put the heads of their charge again&s;t Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> in writing; and the King promi&s;ed to hear lawyers on both &s;ides, and that the Earls of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Halifax</HI> &s;hould be pre&s;ent at the hear|ing. <HI>Mackenzie</HI> was &s;ent for, being the King's advocate, to defend the admini&s;tration; and <HI>Lockhart</HI> and <HI>Cunningham</HI> were to argue again&s;t it. The la&s;t of the&s;e had not indeed <HI>Lockhart</HI>'s quickne&s;s, nor his talent in &s;peaking; but he was a learned and judicious man, and had the mo&s;t univer&s;al, and indeed the mo&s;t de&s;erved reputation for integrity and vertue of any man, not only of his own profe&s;&s;ion, but of the whole
<PB N="470" REF="485">
Nation. The hearing came on as was promi&s;ed; and it was made out beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of an an&s;wer, that the giv|ing commi&s;&s;ions to an Army to live on free Quarters in a quiet time was again&s;t the whole con&s;titution, as well as the expre&s;s laws of that Kingdom; and that it was never done but in an enemy's country, or to &s;uppre&s;s a rebellion: They &s;hewed likewi&s;e, how unju&s;t and illegal all the other parts of his admini&s;tration were. The Earls of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Halifax</HI> told me every thing was made out fully; <HI>Mackenzie</HI> having nothing to &s;helter him&s;elf in, but that flouri&s;h in the act again&s;t field Conventicles, in which they were called the rendezvous of re|bellion; from which he inferred, that the country where the&s;e had been frequent was in a &s;tate of rebellion. Kings naturally love to hear prerogative magnified: Yet on this oc|ca&s;ion the King had nothing to &s;ay in defence of the admi|ni&s;tration. But when <HI>May,</HI> the ma&s;ter of the privy pur&s;e, a&s;ked him in his familiar way what he thought now of his <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> he an&s;wered, as <HI>May</HI> him&s;elf told me, that they had objected many damned things that he had done again&s;t them, but there was nothing objected that was again&s;t his &s;er|vice. Such are the notions that many Kings drink in, by which they &s;et up an intere&s;t for them&s;elves in oppo&s;ition to the intere&s;t of the people: And as &s;oon as the people ob&s;erve that, which they will do &s;ooner or later, then they will na|turally mind their own intere&s;t, and &s;et it up as much in op|po&s;ition to the Prince: And in this conte&s;t the people will grow always too hard for the Prince, unle&s;s he is able to &s;ubdue and govern them by an army. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was beginning to form a &s;cheme of a mini&s;try: But now the government in <HI>Scotland</HI> was &s;o remi&s;s, that the people apprehended they might run into all &s;ort of confu&s;ion. They heard that <HI>England</HI> was in &s;uch di&s;tractions that they needed fear no force from thence. Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s party was lo&s;ing heart, and were fearing &s;uch a new model there as was &s;et up here in <HI>England.</HI> All this &s;et tho&s;e mad people that had run about with the field Conventicles into a frenzy: They drew together in great bodies: Some parties of the troops came to di&s;per&s;e them, but found them both &s;o re|&s;olute and &s;o &s;trong, that they did not think fit to engage them: Sometimes they fired on one another, and &s;ome were killed of both &s;ides.</P>
<P>When a party of furious men were riding thro' a moor near St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> they &s;aw the Archbi&s;hop's coach appear: He <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arch|bi&s;hop of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> is murdered.</NOTE> was coming from a council day, and was driving home: He
<PB N="471" REF="486">
had &s;ent &s;ome of his &s;ervants home before him, to let them know he was coming, and others he had &s;ent off on com|plements; &s;o that there was no hor&s;emen about the coach. They &s;eeing this concluded, according to their frantick enthu&s;ia&s;tick notions, that God had now de|livered up their greate&s;t enemy into their hands: Seven of them made up to the coach, while the re&s;t were as &s;couts riding all about the moor. One of them fired a pi&s;tol at him, which burnt his coat and gown, but did not go into his bo|dy: Upon this they fancied he had a magical &s;ecret to &s;ecure him again&s;t a &s;hot; and they drew him out of his coach, and murdered him barbarou&s;ly, repeating their &s;trokes till they were &s;ure he was quite dead: And &s;o they got clear off, no body happening to go cro&s;s the moor all the while. This was the di&s;mal end of that unhappy man: It &s;truck all people with horror, and &s;oftned his enemies into &s;ome tenderne&s;s: So that his memory was treated with decency by tho&s;e who had very little re&s;pect for him during his life.</P>
<P>A week after that, there was a great field Conventicle held <NOTE PLACE="marg">A rebellion in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> within ten miles of <HI>Gla&s;gow:</HI> A body of the guards engaged with them, and they made &s;uch vigorous re&s;i&s;tance, that the guards having lo&s;t thirty of their number were forced to run for it: So the Conventicle formed it&s;elf into a bo|dy and marched to <HI>Gla&s;gow:</HI> The per&s;on that led them had been bred by me, while I lived at <HI>Gla&s;gow,</HI> being the younger &s;on of Sir <HI>Tho. Hamilton</HI> that had married my &s;i&s;ter, but by a former wife: He was then a lively hopeful young man: But getting into that company, and into their notions, he became a crack-brained enthu&s;ia&s;t. Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> and his party publi&s;hed every where that this rebellion was headed by a nephew of mine, whom I had prepared for &s;uch a work while he was in my hands: Their numbers were &s;o magnified, that a company or two which lay at <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> retired in all ha&s;t, and left the town to them, tho' they were then not above four or five hundred; and the&s;e were &s;o ill armed, and &s;o ill commanded, that a troop of hor&s;e could have ea&s;ily di&s;per&s;ed them. The Council at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> &s;ent the Earl of <HI>Linlithgow</HI> again&s;t them with a thou&s;and foot, two hundred hor&s;e, and two hundred dragoons: A force much greater than was nece&s;&s;ary for making head again&s;t &s;uch a rabble. He march|ed till he came within ten miles of them; and then he pre|tended he had intelligence that they were above eight thou|&s;and &s;trong; &s;o he marched back; for he &s;aid, it was the venturing the whole force the King had upon too great an
<PB N="472" REF="487">
inequality: He could never prove that he had any &s;uch in|telligence: Some imputed this to his fear: Others thought, that being much engaged with Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> he did this on purpo&s;e to give them time to encrea&s;e their numbers: And thought their madne&s;s would be the be&s;t ju&s;tification of all the violences that had been committed in Duke <HI>Lau|derdale</HI>'s admini&s;tration. Thus the country was left in their hands: And if there had been any de&s;igns or preparations made formerly for a rebellion, now they had time enough to run together and to form them&s;elves: But it appeared that there had been no &s;uch de&s;igns, by this, that none came into it but tho&s;e de&s;perate intercommoned men, who were as it were hunted from their hou&s;es into all tho&s;e extravagances that men may fall in, who wander about inflaming one another, and are heated in it with fal&s;e notions of Religion. The re|bels having the country left to their di&s;cretion fancied that their numbers would quickly encrea&s;e: And they &s;et out a &s;ort of manife&s;to, complaining of the oppre&s;&s;ions they lay under, a&s;&s;erting the obligation of the covenant: And they concluded it with the demand of a free Parliament. When the news of this came to Court, Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> &s;aid, it was the effect of the encouragement that they had from the King's hearkning to their complaints: Whereas all indifferent men thought it was rather to be imputed to his in&s;olence and tyranny.</P>
<P>The King re&s;olved to lo&s;e no time: So he &s;ent the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> down po&s;t, with full powers to command in chief: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Monmouth</HI> &s;ent down to &s;uppre&s;s it.</NOTE> And directions were &s;ent to &s;ome troops that lay in the north of <HI>England</HI> to be ready to march upon his orders. Duke <HI>Lau|derdale</HI> apprehended that tho&s;e in arms would pre&s;ently &s;ub|mit to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> if there was but time given for proper in&s;truments to go among them, and that then they would pretend they had been forced into that ri&s;ing by the violence of the government: So he got the King to &s;end po&s;itive orders after him, that he &s;hould not treat with them, but fall on them immediately: Yet he marched &s;o &s;lowly that they had time enough given them to di&s;po&s;e them to a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion. They fixed at <HI>Hamilton,</HI> near which there is a bridge on <HI>Clide,</HI> which it was believed they intended to defend; but they took no care of it. They &s;ent &s;ome to treat with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth:</HI> He an&s;wered, that if they would &s;ubmit to the King's mercy, and lay down their arms, he would interpo&s;e for their pardon, but that he would not treat with them as long as they were in arms: And &s;ome were be|ginning
<PB N="473" REF="488">
to pre&s;s their rendring them&s;elves at di&s;cretion: They had neither the grace to &s;ubmit, nor the &s;en&s;e to march a|way, nor the Courage to fight it out: But &s;uffered the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the bridge. They were then four thou&s;and men: But few of them were well armed: If they had charged tho&s;e that came fir&s;t over the bridge, they <NOTE PLACE="marg">They were &s;oon broken.</NOTE> might have had &s;ome advantage: But they looked on like men that had lo&s;t both &s;en&s;e and courage: And upon the fir&s;t charge they threw down their arms and ran away: There were between two or three hundred killed, and twelve hundred taken pri&s;oners. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> &s;topt the execution that his men were making as &s;oon as he could, and &s;aved the pri&s;oners; for &s;ome moved, that they &s;hould be all killed upon the &s;pot. Yet this was afterwards objected to him as a neglect of the King's &s;ervice, and as a courting the people: The Duke of <HI>York</HI> talked of it in that &s;train: And the King him&s;elf &s;aid to him, that if he had been there they &s;hould not have had the trouble of pri&s;oners: He an&s;wered, he could not kill men in cold blood; that was work only for butchers. Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s creatures pre&s;&s;ed the keeping the army &s;ome time in that Country, on de&s;ign to have eat it up: But the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> &s;ent home the Militia, and put the troops under di&s;cipline: So that all that Country was &s;en&s;ible, that he had pre&s;erved them from ruin: The very fanatical party confe&s;&s;ed that he treated them as gently as po&s;&s;ible, con&s;dering their madne&s;s: He came back to Court as &s;oon as he had &s;ettled matters, and moved the King to grant an indemnity for what was pa&s;t, and a liberty to hold meetings under the King's licen&s;e or connivance: He &s;hewed the King that all this madne&s;s of field Conventicles flowed only from the &s;everity again&s;t tho&s;e that were held within doors. Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> drew the indemnity in &s;uch a man|ner that it carried in &s;ome clau&s;es of it a full pardon to him|&s;elf and all his party; but he clogged it much with relation to tho&s;e for whom it was granted. All Gentlemen, Preachers and Officers were excepted out of it; &s;o that the favour of it was much limited two of their Preachers were hanged, but the other pri&s;oners were let go upon their &s;igning a bond for keeping the peace: Two hundred of them were &s;ent to <HI>Virginia,</HI> but they were all ca&s;t away at &s;ea. Thus ended this tumultuary rebellion, which went by the name of <HI>Bothwell-Bridge,</HI> where the action was. The King &s;oon after &s;ent down orders for allowing meeting hou&s;es: But the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s intere&s;t &s;unk &s;o &s;oon after this, that the&s;e were

&s;carce opened when they were &s;hut up again: Their enemies &s;aid, this looked like a rewarding them for their rebellion.</P>
<P>An accident happened &s;oon after this that put the whole Nation in a fright, and produced very great effects: The <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King taken ill, and the Duke comes to Court.</NOTE> King was taken ill at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> of an intermitting fever: The fits were &s;o long and &s;o &s;evere, that the phy&s;icians apprehend|ed he was in danger: Upon which he ordered the Duke to be &s;ent for, but very &s;ecretly; for it was communicated to none but to the Earls of <HI>Sunderland, E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Halifax.</HI> The Duke made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te, and came in di&s;gui&s;e thro <HI>Calais,</HI> as the quicker pa&s;&s;age: But the danger was over before he came: The fits did not return after the King took <HI>Quinquina,</HI> called in <HI>England</HI> the <HI>Je&s;uits powder:</HI> As he recovered it was moved, that the Duke &s;hould be again &s;ent beyond &s;ea: He had no mind to it: But when the King was po&s;itive in it, he moved that the Duke of <HI>Manmouth</HI> &s;hould be put out of all command, and likewi&s;e &s;ent beyond &s;ea. The Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI>'s friends advi&s;ed him to agree to this; for he might depend on it, that as &s;oon as the Parliament met an ad|dre&s;s would be made to the King for bringing him back, &s;ince his being thus dive&s;ted of his commi&s;&s;ions, and &s;ent away at the Duke's de&s;ire, would rai&s;e his intere&s;t in the Nation.</P>
<P>At this time the party that began to be made for the Duke of <HI>York</HI> were endeavouring to blow matters up into a flame <NOTE PLACE="marg">The many fal&s;e &s;tories &s;pread to rai&s;e jea|lou&s;y.</NOTE> every where: Of which the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> gave me the follow|ing in&s;tance, by which it was ea&s;y to judge what &s;ort of in|telligence they were apt to give, and how they were po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing the King and his mini&s;ters with ill grounded fears: He came once to <HI>London</HI> on &s;ome trea&s;ury bu&s;ine&s;s the day before the common Hall was to meet in the City: So the &s;pies that were employed to bring news from all corners came to him, and a&s;&s;ured him that it was re&s;olved next day to make u&s;e of the noi&s;e of that meeting, and to &s;eize on the Tower, and do all &s;uch things as could be managed by a popular fury. The adverti&s;ements came to him from &s;o many hands, that he was inclined to believe there was &s;omewhat in it: Some pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;end &s;oldiers into the Tower and to the other parts of the City. He would not take the alarm &s;o hot, but he &s;ent to the Lieutenant of the Tower to be on his guard: And he ordered &s;ome companies to be drawn up in <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> and in <HI>Lincolns Inn Fields:</HI> And he had two hundred men ready, and barges prepared to carry them to the Tower, if there &s;hould have been the lea&s;t &s;hadow of tumult: But he would not

&s;eem to fear a di&s;order too much, le&s;t perhaps that might have produced one: Yet after all the affrightning &s;tories that had been brought him, the next day pa&s;t over very calmly, it not appearing by the lea&s;t circum&s;tance that any thing was de&s;igned, be&s;ides the bu&s;ine&s;s for which the common Hall was &s;ummoned. He often reflected on this matter: Tho&s;e mercenary &s;pies are very officious, that they may de&s;erve their pay; and they &s;hape their &s;tory to the tempers of tho&s;e whom they &s;erve: And to &s;uch creatures, and to their fal&s;e intelli|gence, I imputed a great deal of the jealou&s;y that I found the King po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with. Both the Dukes went now beyond &s;ea: And that enmity which was more &s;ecret before, and was co|vered with a Court civility, did now break out open and barefaced. But it &s;eemed that the Duke of <HI>York</HI> had prevailed with the King not to call the Parliament that winter, in hope that the heat the Nation was in would with the help of &s;ome time grow cooler, and that the party that began now to declare more openly for the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion would gain ground. There was al&s;o a pretended di&s;covery now ready to break out, which the Duke might be made believe would carry off the plot from the Papi&s;ts, and ca&s;t it on the contrary party.</P>
<P><HI>Dangerfield,</HI> a &s;ubtile and dexterous man, who had gone <NOTE PLACE="marg">A pretended plot di&s;co|vered, called the <HI>Meal-tub</HI> plot.</NOTE> thro' all the &s;hapes and practices of roguery, and in particu|lar was a fal&s;e coiner, undertook now to coin a plot for the ends of the Papi&s;ts. He was in jayl for debt, and was in an ill intrigue with one <HI>Cellier</HI> a Popi&s;h midwife, who had a great &s;hare of wit, and was abandoned to lewdne&s;s. She got him to be brought out of pri&s;on, and carried him to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Powis</HI> a zealous managing Papi&s;t. He, after he had laid matters with her, as will afterwards appear, got into all companies, and mixed with the hotte&s;t men of the Town, and &s;tudied to engage others with him&s;elf to &s;wear, that they had been invited to accept of commi&s;&s;ions, and that a new form of government was to be &s;et up, and that the King and the Royal Family were to be &s;ent away. He was carried with this &s;tory fir&s;t to the Duke, and then to the King, and had a weekly allowance of money, and was very kindly u&s;ed by many of that &s;ide; &s;o that a whi&s;per run about Town, that &s;ome extraordinary thing would quickly break out: And he having &s;ome corre&s;pondence with one Collonel <HI>Man&s;el,</HI> he made up a bundle of &s;editious but ill contrived letters, and laid them in a dark corner of his room: And then &s;ome &s;earch|ers were &s;ent from the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e to look for &s;ome forbid|den
<PB N="476" REF="491">
goods, which they heard were in <HI>Man&s;el</HI>'s chamber. There were no goods found: But as it was laid they found that bundle of letters: And upon that a great noi&s;e was made of a di&s;covery: But upon enquiry it appeared the letters were counterfeited, and the forger of them was &s;u&s;pected; &s;o they &s;earched into all <HI>Dangerfield</HI>'s haunts, and in one of them they found a paper that contained the &s;cheme of this whole fiction, which becau&s;e it was found in a <HI>Meal-tub</HI> came to be called the <HI>Meal-tub</HI> plot. <HI>Dangerfield</HI> was upon that clapt up, and he &s;oon after confe&s;&s;ed how the whole mat|ter was laid and managed: In which it is very probable he mixed much of his own invention with truth, for he was a profligate liar. This was a great di&s;grace to the Popi&s;h par|ty, and the King &s;uffered much by the countenance he had given him: The Earls of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Halifax</HI> were &s;et down in the &s;cheme to be &s;worn again&s;t with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Upon this they pre&s;&s;ed the King vehemently to call a Parlia|ment <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great jea|lou&s;ies of the King.</NOTE> immediately. But the King thought that if a Parliament &s;hould meet while all mens &s;pirits were &s;harpned by this new di&s;|covery, he would find them in wor&s;e temper than ever: When the King could not be prevailed on to do that, Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> left the trea&s;ury. The King was very unea&s;y at this. But Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was firm in his re&s;olution not to med|dle in that po&s;t more &s;ince a Parliament was not called: Yet, at the King's earne&s;t de&s;ire, he continued for &s;ome time to go to Council. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> fell ill, much from a vexation of mind: His &s;pirits were oppre&s;&s;ed, a deep melancholy &s;eizing him: For a fortnight together I was once a day with him, and found then that he had deep impre&s;&s;ions of Religion on him: Some fooli&s;h people gave it out that he was mad: But I never knew him &s;o near a &s;tate of true wi&s;dom as he was at that time. He was much troubled at the King's forgetting his promi&s;e to hold a Parliament that winter; and expo&s;tulated &s;everely upon it with &s;ome that were &s;ent to him from the King: He was offered to be made Secretary of State, but he refu&s;ed it. Some gave it out that he pretended to be Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and was unea&s;y when that was denied him: But he &s;aid to me that it was offered him, and he had re|fu&s;ed it. He did not love, he &s;aid, a new &s;cene, nor to dine with &s;ound of trumpet and thirty &s;ix di&s;hes of meat on his table. He likewi&s;e &s;aw that Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had a mind to be again there; and he was confident he was better fitted for it than he him&s;elf was. My being much with him at that
<PB N="477" REF="492">
time was reflected on: It was &s;aid, I had heightned his di&s;|affection to the Court. I was with him only as a divine.</P>
<P>The Court went on in their own pace: Lord <HI>Twedale</HI> be|ing then at <HI>London</HI> moved the Earl of <HI>Peterborough,</HI> that it would be more honourable, and more for the Duke's intere&s;t, in&s;tead of living beyond &s;ea to go and live in <HI>Scotland.</HI> Lord <HI>Peterborough</HI> went immediately with it to the King, who ap|proved of it. So notice was given the Duke: And he was appointed to meet the King at <HI>New-Market</HI> in <HI>October.</HI> Lord <HI>Twedale</HI> &s;aw that &s;ince the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> had lo&s;t his credit with the King, Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> would again be con|tinued in his po&s;ts; and that he would act over his former extravagances: Whereas he reckoned that this would be checked by the Duke's going to <HI>Scotland;</HI> and that he would &s;tudy to make him&s;elf acceptable to that Nation, and bring things a|mong them into order and temper. The Duke met the King at <HI>New-Market</HI> as it was ordered: But upon that the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> who was yet Pre&s;ident of the Council, tho' he had quite lo&s;t all his intere&s;t in the King, called a Council at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and repre&s;ented to them the danger the King was in by the Duke's being &s;o near him; and pre&s;&s;ed the Council to repre&s;ent this to the King. But they did not agree to it: And upon the King's coming to <HI>London</HI> he was turned out, and Lord <HI>Roberts,</HI> made then Earl of <HI>Radnor,</HI> was made Lord Pre|&s;ident.</P>
<P>The Duke went to <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;oon after: And upon that the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Monmouth's</HI> di&s;grace.</NOTE> Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> grew impatient, when he found he was &s;till to be kept beyond &s;ea. He begged the King's leave to return: But when he &s;aw no hope of obtaining it, he came over without leave. The King upon that would not &s;ee him, and required him to go back; on which his friends were divided. Some advi&s;ed him to comply with the King's plea&s;ure: But he gave him&s;elf fatally up to the Lord <HI>Shafts|bury's</HI> conduct, who put him on all the methods imaginable to make him&s;elf popular. He went round many parts of <HI>England,</HI> pretending it was for hunting and hor&s;e matches, many thou&s;ands coming together in mo&s;t places to &s;ee him: So that this looked like the mu&s;tering up the force of the party: But it really weakned it: Many grew jealous of the de|&s;ign, and fancied here was a new civil war to be rai&s;ed. Up|on this they joined in with the Duke's party. Lord <HI>Shafts|bury</HI> &s;et al&s;o on foot petitions for a Parliament, in order to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Petitions for a Parliament.</NOTE> the &s;ecuring the King's per&s;on, and the Prote&s;tant Religion. The&s;e were carried about and &s;igned in many places, not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="487" REF="493">
the King &s;et out a proclamation again&s;t them: Upon that a &s;et of counter petitions was promoted by the Court, expre&s;&s;ing an abhorrence of all &s;editious practices, and referring the time of calling a Parliament wholly to the King. There were not &s;uch numbers that joined in the petitions for the Parliament, as had been expected: So this &s;hewed rather the weakne&s;s than the &s;trength of the party: And many well mean|ing men began to di&s;like tho&s;e practices, and to apprehend that a change of government was de&s;igned.</P>
<P>Some made a reflection on that whole method of proceed|ing, which may de&s;erve well to be remembred: In the in|tervals of Parliament, men that complain of the government by keeping them&s;elves in a &s;ullen and quiet &s;tate, and avoid|ing cabals and publick a&s;&s;emblies, grow thereby the &s;tronger and more capable to make a &s;tand when a Parliament comes: Whereas by their forming of parties out of Parliament, un|le&s;s in order to the managing of elections, they do both expo&s;e them&s;elves to much danger, and bring an ill character on their de&s;igns over the Nation; which naturally loves par|liamentary cures, but is jealous of all other methods.</P>
<P>The King was now wholly in the Duke's intere&s;t, and re|&s;olved <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great di&s;|content on all &s;ides.</NOTE> to pa&s;s that winter without a Parliament. Upon which the Lords <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> and <HI>Cavendi&s;h,</HI> Sir <HI>Henry Capel,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Powel,</HI> four of the new Coun&s;ellors, de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from their attendance in Council. Several of tho&s;e who were put in the Admiralty and in other commi&s;&s;ions de&s;ired like|wi&s;e to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed: With this the King was &s;o highly of|fended, that he became more &s;ullen and intractable than he had ever been before.</P>
<P>The men that governed now were the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Godolphin</HI>'s character.</NOTE> Lord <HI>Hide,</HI> and <HI>Godolphin:</HI> The la&s;t of the&s;e was a younger brother of an ancient Family in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> that had been bred about the King from a page, and was now con&s;idered as one of the able&s;t men that belonged to the Court: He was the &s;ilente&s;t and mode&s;te&s;t man that was perhaps ever bred in a Court. He had a clear apprehen&s;ion, and di&s;patched bu&s;i|ne&s;s with great method, and with &s;o much temper that he had no per&s;onal enemies: But his &s;ilence begot a jealou&s;y, which has hung long upon him. His notions were for the Court: But his incorrupt and &s;incere way of managing the concerns of the trea&s;ury created in all people a very high e&s;teem for him. He loved gaming the mo&s;t of any man of bu&s;ine&s;s I ever knew; and gave one rea&s;on for it, becau&s;e it delivered him from the obligation to talk much: He had
<PB N="479" REF="494">
true principles of religion and vertue, and was free from all vanity, and never heaped up wealth: So that all things being laid together, he was one of the worthie&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t men that has been employed in our time: And he has had much of the confidence of four of our &s;ucceeding Princes.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of the year eighty the Duke had leave to <NOTE PLACE="marg">1680</NOTE> come to <HI>England;</HI> and continued about the King till next winter, that the Parliament was to &s;it. Foreign affairs &s;eemed to be forgot by our Court. The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had pro|jected <NOTE PLACE="marg">An alliance projected a|gain&s;t <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> an alliance again&s;t <HI>France:</HI> And mo&s;t of the <HI>German</HI> Princes were much di&s;po&s;ed to come into it: For the <HI>French</HI> had &s;et up a new Court at <HI>Metz,</HI> in which many Princes were, under the pretence of dependencies and &s;ome old for|got or forged titles, judged to belong to the new <HI>French</HI> conque&s;ts. This was a mean as well as a perfidious practice, in which the Court of <HI>France</HI> rai&s;ed much more jealou&s;y and hatred again&s;t them&s;elves than could ever be balanced by &s;uch &s;mall acce&s;&s;ions as were adjudged by that mock Court. The Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI> entred into a particular confidence with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> which he managed by his Uncle Mr. <HI>Sidney,</HI> who was &s;ent Envoy to <HI>Holland:</HI> The Prince &s;eemed confident, that if <HI>England</HI> would come heartily into it, a &s;trong confederacy might then have been formed a|gain&s;t <HI>France. Van Beuning</HI> was then in <HI>England:</HI> And he wrote to the town of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> that they could not depend on the faith or a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>England.</HI> He a&s;&s;ured them the Court was &s;till in the <HI>French</HI> intere&s;t: He al&s;o looked on the jealou&s;y between the Court and the Country party as then &s;o high, that he did not believe it po&s;&s;ible to heal matters &s;o as to encourage the King to enter into any alliance that might draw on a war: For the King &s;eemed to &s;et that up for a maxim, that his going into a war was the putting him&s;elf into the hands of his Parliament; and was firmly re&s;olved again&s;t it. Yet the project of a league was formed: And the King &s;eemed inclined to go into it, as &s;oon as matters could be well adju&s;ted at home.</P>
<P>There was this year at mid&s;ummer a new practice begun <NOTE PLACE="marg">The $word$|on $word$ $word$ Sh$span$ <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> in the city of <HI>London,</HI> that produced very ill con&s;equences. The city of <HI>London</HI> has by Charter the &s;hrivalry of <HI>Middle|&s;ex,</HI> as well as of the city: And the two Sheriffs were to be cho&s;en on mid&s;ummer day. But the common method had been for the Lord <HI>Mayor</HI> to name one of the Sheriffs by drinking to him on a publick occa&s;ion: And that nomi|nation
<PB N="480" REF="495">
was commonly confirmed by the Common Hall: And then they named the other Sheriff. The truth was, the way in which the Sheriffs lived made it a charge of about 5000 <HI>l.</HI> a year: So they took little care about it, but only to find men that would bear the charge; which recommended them to be cho&s;en Aldermen upon the next vacancy, and to ri&s;e up according to their &s;tanding to the Mayoralty, which generally went in cour&s;e to the &s;enior Alderman. When a per&s;on was &s;et up to be Sheriff that would not &s;erve, he compounded the matter for 400 <HI>l.</HI> fine. All juries were returned by the Sheriffs: But they commonly left that wholly in the hands of their Under-Sheriffs: So it was now pretended that it was nece&s;&s;ary to look a little more carefully after this matter. The Under-Sheriffs were generally Attorneys, and might be ea&s;ily brought under the management of the Court: So it was propo&s;ed, that the Sheriffs &s;hould be cho&s;en with more care, not &s;o much that they might keep good tables, as that they &s;hould return good juries: The per&s;on to whom the pre&s;ent Mayor had drunk was &s;et a&s;ide: And <HI>Bethel</HI> and <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> were cho&s;en Sheriffs for the en&s;uing year. <HI>Bethel</HI> was a man of knowledge, and had writ a very judicious book of the inte|re&s;ts of Princes: But as he was a known republican in princi|ple, &s;o he was a &s;ullen and wilful man; and turned from the ordinary way of a Sheriff's living into the extream of &s;or|didne&s;s, which was very unacceptable to the body of the citi|zens, and proved a great prejudice to the party. <HI>Corni&s;h,</HI> the other Sheriff was a plain, warm, hone&s;t man; and lived very no|bly all his year: The Court was very jealous of this, and under|&s;tood it to be done on de&s;ign to pack juries: So that the party &s;hould be alwayes &s;afe, whatever they might engage in. It was &s;aid, that the King would not have common ju&s;tice done him hereafter again&s;t any of them, how guilty &s;oever. The &s;etting up <HI>Bethel</HI> gave a great colour to this jealou&s;y; for it was &s;aid, he had expre&s;&s;ed his approving the late King's death in very indecent terms. The&s;e two per|&s;ons had never before received the Sacrament in the Church, being Independents: But they did it now to qualify them|&s;elves for this office, which gave great advantages again&s;t the whole party: It was &s;aid, that the &s;erving an end was a good re&s;olver of all ca&s;es of con&s;cience, and purged all &s;cruples.</P>
<P>Thus matters went on till the winter eighty, in which the King re&s;olved to hold a &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament: He &s;ent the Duke to <HI>Scotland</HI> a few days before their meeting: And
<PB N="481" REF="496">
upon that the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> declared openly for the Exclu&s;ion; and &s;o did Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI> and <HI>Godolphin.</HI> Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI> a&s;&s;ured all people, that the King was re&s;olved to &s;ettle matters with his Parliament on any terms, &s;ince the intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> and the affairs of <HI>Europe</HI> made a league again&s;t <HI>France</HI> indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary at that time; which could not be done without a good under&s;tanding at home. Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI> &s;ent Lord <HI>Arran</HI> for me: I declined this new acquaintance as much as I could: But it could not be avoid|ed: He &s;eemed then very zealous for a happy &s;ettlement: And this I owe him in Ju&s;tice, that tho' he went off from the mea&s;ures he was in at that time, yet he &s;till continued per&s;onally kind to my &s;elf: Now the great point was, whether the limitations &s;hould be accepted, and treated about, or the Exclu&s;ion be pur&s;ued. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> a&s;&s;ured me, that any <NOTE PLACE="marg">The bill of exclu&s;ion a|gain taken up.</NOTE> limitations what&s;oever that &s;hould leave the title of King to the Duke, tho' it &s;hould be little more than a meer title, might be obtained of the King: But that he was po&s;itive and fixed again&s;t the Exclu&s;ion. It is true, this was in a great mea&s;ure imputed to his management, and that he had wrought the King up to it.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t &s;pecious handle for recommending the limita|tions was this: The Duke declared openly again&s;t them: So if the King &s;hould have agreed to them, it mu&s;t have occa|&s;ioned a breach between him and the Duke: And it &s;eemed to be very de&s;irable to have them once fall out; &s;ince, as &s;oon as that was brought about, the King of his own accord and for his own &s;ecurity might be moved to promote the Exclu&s;ion. The truth is, Lord <HI>Halifax</HI>'s hatred of the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> and his vanity in de&s;iring to have his own notion preferred, &s;harpned him at that time to much inde|cency in his whole deportment: But the party depended on the hopes that Lady <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> and Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI> gave them: Many meetings were appointed between Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> and &s;ome leading men; in which as he tried to divert them from the Exclu&s;ion, &s;o they &s;tudied to per&s;uade him to it, both without effect. The majority had engaged them&s;elves to promote the Exclu&s;ion, Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> moved it fir&s;t in the Hou&s;e of Commons, and was &s;econded by <HI>Capel, Mountague,</HI> and <HI>Winnington: Jones</HI> came into the Hou&s;e a few days after this, and went with great zeal into it: <HI>Jenkins,</HI> now made Secretary of State in <HI>Coventry</HI>'s place, was the chief manager for the Court. He was a man of an exemplary life, and con&s;iderably learned: But he was dull and &s;low: He was
<PB N="482" REF="497">
&s;u&s;pected of leaning to Popery, tho' very unju&s;tly: But he was &s;et on every punctilio of the Church of <HI>England</HI> to &s;u|per&s;tition, and was a great a&s;&s;ertor of the divine right of monarchy, and was for carrying the prerogative high: He nei|ther &s;poke nor writ well: But being &s;o eminent for the mo&s;t courtly qualifications, other matters were the more ea&s;ily di&s;|pen&s;ed with. All his &s;peeches and arguments again&s;t the Ex|clu&s;ion were heard with indignation: So the bill was brought into the Hou&s;e. It was moved by tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed it, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pa&s;t by the commons.</NOTE> that the Duke's daughters might be named in it, as the next in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: But it was &s;aid, that was not nece&s;&s;ary; for &s;ince the Duke was only per&s;onally di&s;abled, as if he had been actually dead, that carried the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion over to his daughters: Yet this gave a jealou&s;y, as if it was intended to keep that matter &s;till undetermined; and that upon another occa&s;ion it might be pretended, that the di&s;abling the Duke to &s;ucceed did likewi&s;e di&s;able him to derive that right to others, which was thus cut off in him&s;elf. But tho' they would not name the Duke's daughters, yet they &s;ent &s;uch a&s;|&s;urances to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> that nothing thus propo&s;ed could be to his prejudice, that he believed them, and de|clared his de&s;ire, that the King would fully &s;atisfy his Par|liament: The States &s;ent over memorials to the King, pre&s;|&s;ing him to con&s;ent to the Exclu&s;ion. The Prince did not openly appear in this: But it being managed by <HI>Fagel,</HI> it was under&s;tood that he approved of it: And this created a hatred in the Duke to him, which was never to be removed. Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI> by <HI>Sidney</HI>'s means engaged the States into it: And he fancied that it might have &s;ome effect.</P>
<P>The bill of Exclu&s;ion was quickly brought up to the Lords. The Earls of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> argued mo&s;t for it: And the Earl of <HI>Halifax</HI> was the champion on the other &s;ide: He gained great honour in the debate; and had a vi&s;ible &s;upe|riority to Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> in the opinion of the whole Hou&s;e: <NOTE PLACE="marg">But rejected by the Lords.</NOTE> And that was to him triumph enough. In conclu&s;ion, the bill was thrown out upon the fir&s;t reading: The country par|ty brought it nearer an equality, than was imagined they could do, con&s;idering the King's earne&s;tne&s;s in it, and that the whole bench of the Bi&s;hops was again&s;t it. The Commons were inflamed when they &s;aw the fate of their bill: They voted an addre&s;s to the King to remove Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> from his coun&s;els and pre&s;ence for ever: Which was an unparliamen|tary thing; &s;ince it was vi&s;ible that it was for his arguing as he did in the Hou&s;e of Lords, tho' they pretended it was
<PB N="483" REF="498">
for his advi&s;ing the di&s;&s;olution of the la&s;t Parliament: But that was a thin di&s;gui&s;e of their anger: Yet without de&s;troy|ing the freedom of debate, they could not found their ad|dre&s;s on that which was the true cau&s;e of it. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> and <HI>Jones,</HI> tho' formerly Lord <HI>Halifax</HI>'s friends, thought it was enough not to &s;peak again&s;t him in the Hou&s;e of Commons: But they &s;at &s;ilent. Some called him a Papi&s;t: Others &s;aid he was an Athei&s;t. <HI>Chichely,</HI> that had married his mother, moved, that I might be &s;ent for to &s;atisfy the Hou&s;e as to the truth of his Religion. I wi&s;h, I could have &s;aid as much to have per&s;uaded them that he was a good Chri&s;tian, as that he was no Papi&s;t: I was at that time in a very good charac|ter in that Hou&s;e: The fir&s;t volume of the Hi&s;tory of the Reformation was then out; and was &s;o well received, that I had the thanks of both Hou&s;es for it, and was de&s;ired by both to pro&s;ecute that work. The Parliament had made an addre&s;s to the King for a fa&s;t day. Dr. <HI>Sprat</HI> and I were ordered to preach before the Hou&s;e of Commons: My turn was in the morning: I mentioned nothing relating to the plot, but what appeared in <HI>Coleman</HI>'s letters: Yet I laid open the cruelties of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in many in&s;tances that hapned in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Reign, which were not then known: And I aggravated, tho' very truly, the danger of falling under the power of that Religion. I pre&s;&s;ed al&s;o a mutual forbearance among our &s;elves in le&s;&s;er matters: But I in&s;i&s;ted mo&s;t on the impiety and vices that had worn out all &s;en&s;e of Religion, and all regard to it among us. <HI>Sprat</HI> in the afternoon went further into the belief of the plot than I had done: But he in&s;inuated his fears of their undutifulne&s;s to the King in a &s;uch manner, that they were highly offended at him: So the Commons did not &s;end him thanks, as they did to me; which rai&s;ed his merit at Court, as it increa&s;ed the di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t me. <HI>Sprat</HI> had &s;tudied a polite &s;tile much: But there was little &s;trength in it: He had the beginnings of learning laid well in him: But he has allowed him&s;elf in a cour&s;e of &s;ome years in much &s;loth and too many liberties.</P>
<P>The King &s;ent many me&s;&s;ages to the Hou&s;e of Commons, pre&s;&s;ing for a &s;upply, fir&s;t for pre&s;erving <HI>Tangier,</HI> he being then in a war with the King of <HI>Fez,</HI> which by rea&s;on of the di&s;tance put him to much charge; but chiefly, for ena|bling him to go into alliances nece&s;&s;ary for the common pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="484" REF="499">
The Hou&s;e upon that made a long repre&s;entation to the King of the dangers that both he and they were in; and a&s;&s;ured him, they would do every thing that he could expect of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hou&s;e of Com|mons pro|ceeded a|gain&s;t &s;ome with &s;eve|rity.</NOTE> them, as &s;oon as they were well &s;ecured: By which they meant, as &s;oon as the Exclu&s;ion &s;hould pa&s;s, and that bad Mini&s;ters, and ill Judges &s;hould be removed. They renew|ed their addre&s;s again&s;t Lord <HI>Halifax;</HI> and made addre&s;&s;es both again&s;t the Marquis of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> &s;oon after made Duke of <HI>Beaufort,</HI> and again&s;t Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> and <HI>Hide,</HI> as men in|clined to Popery. <HI>Hyde</HI> &s;poke &s;o vehemently to vindicate him&s;elf from the &s;u&s;picions of Popery, that he cried in his &s;peech: And <HI>Jones</HI> upon the &s;core of old friend&s;hip got the words relating to Popery to be &s;truck out of the addre&s;s again&s;t him. The Com|mons al&s;o impeached &s;everal of the Judges, and Mr. <HI>Seymour:</HI> The Judges were accu&s;ed for &s;ome illegal charges and judg|ments; and <HI>Seymour,</HI> for corruption and male-admini&s;tration in the office of trea&s;urer of the Navy. They impeached <HI>Scroggs</HI> for high trea&s;on: But it was vi&s;ible that the matters objected to him were only mi&s;demeanors: So the Lords re|jected the impeachment; which was carried chiefly by the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI>'s party, and in favour to him. The Commons did al&s;o a&s;&s;ert the right of the people to petition for a Par|liament: And becau&s;e &s;ome in their counter-petitions had expre&s;&s;ed their abhorrence of this practice, they voted the&s;e abhorrers to be betrayers of the liberties of the Nation. They expelled one <HI>Withins</HI> out of their Hou&s;e for &s;igning one of the&s;e, tho' he with great humility confe&s;&s;ed his fault, and begged pardon for it. The merit of this rai&s;ed him &s;oon to be a Judge; for indeed he had no other merit: They fell al&s;o on Sir <HI>George Jefferies,</HI> a furious declaimer at the bar: But he was rai&s;ed by that, as well as by this pro&s;ecution. The Hou&s;e did likewi&s;e &s;end their Serjeant to many parts of <HI>England</HI> to bring up abhorrers as delinquents: Upon which the right that they had to impri&s;on any be&s;ides their own members came to be much que&s;tioned, &s;ince they could not receive an information upon oath, nor proceed again&s;t &s;uch as refu&s;ed to appear before them. In many places tho&s;e for whom they &s;ent their Serjeant refu&s;ed to come up. It was found, that &s;uch practices were grounded on no law, and were no elder than Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time: While the Hou&s;e of Commons u&s;ed that power gently, it was &s;ubmitted to in re&s;pect to it: But now it grew to be &s;o much extended, that many re&s;olved not to &s;ubmit to it. The former Parliament had pa&s;t a very &s;trict act for the due execution of the <HI>Habeas
<PB N="485" REF="500">
Corpus;</HI> which was indeed all they did: It was carried by an odd artifice in the Hou&s;e of Lords. Lord <HI>Grey</HI> and Lord <HI>Norris</HI> were named to be the tellers: Lord <HI>Norris,</HI> being a man &s;ubject to vapours, was not at all times attentive to what he was doing: So a very fat Lord coming in, Lord <HI>Grey</HI> counted him for ten, as a je&s;t at fir&s;t: But &s;eeing Lord <HI>Nor|ris</HI> had not ob&s;erved it, he went on with this mi&s;reckoning of ten: So it was reported to the Hou&s;e, and declared that they who were for the bill were the Majority, tho' it indeed went on the other &s;ide: And by this means the bill pa&s;t. There was a bold forward man, <HI>Sheredon,</HI> a native of <HI>Ireland,</HI> whom the Commons committed: And he moved for his <HI>Habeas Corpus:</HI> Some of the Judges were afraid of the Hou&s;e, and kept out of the way: But Baron <HI>We&s;ton</HI> had the courage to grant it. The &s;e&s;&s;ion went yet into a higher &s;train; for they voted, that all anticipations on any branches of the Reve|nue were again&s;t law, and that who&s;oever lent any money upon the credit of tho&s;e anticipations were publick enemies to the Kingdom. Upon this it was &s;aid, that the Parlia|ment would neither &s;upply the King them&s;elves, nor &s;uffer him to make u&s;e of his credit, which every private man might do. They &s;aid on the other hand, that they looked on the revenue as a publick trea&s;ure, that was to be kept clear of all anticipations, and not as a private e&s;tate that might be mortgaged: And they thought, when all other means of &s;upply except by Parliament were &s;topped, that mu&s;t certainly bring the King to their terms. Yet the clamour rai&s;ed on this, as if they had intended to &s;tarve the King, and bla&s;t his credit, was a great load on them: And their vote had no effect, for the King continued to have the &s;ame credit that he had before. Another vote went much higher: It was for an a&s;&s;ociation, copied from that in Queen <HI>Eliza|beth</HI>'s <NOTE PLACE="marg">An a&s;&s;ociati|on propo&s;ed.</NOTE> time, for the revenging the King's death upon all Pa|pi&s;ts, if he &s;hould happen to be killed. The precedent of that time was a &s;pecious colour: But this difference was a&s;|&s;igned between the two ca&s;es: Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was in no danger but from Papi&s;ts: So that a&s;&s;ociation &s;truck a ter|ror into that whole party, which did prove a real &s;ecurity to her; and therefore her Mini&s;ters &s;et it on. But now, it was &s;aid, there were many Republicans &s;till in the Nation, and many of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s officers were yet alive, who &s;eemed not to repent of what they had done: So &s;ome of the&s;e might by this means be encouraged to attempt on the King's life, pre&s;uming that both the &s;u&s;picions and revenges of it would
<PB N="486" REF="501">
be ca&s;t upon the Duke and the Papi&s;ts. Great u&s;e was made of this to po&s;&s;e&s;s all people, that this a&s;&s;ociation was in|tended to de&s;troy the King, in&s;tead of pre&s;erving him.</P>
<P>There was not much done in the Hou&s;e of Lords after they threw out the bill of Exclu&s;ion. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> indeed pre&s;|&s;ed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Expedients offered in the Hou&s;e of Lords.</NOTE> them to go on to limitations: And he began with one, that the Duke &s;hould be obliged to live five hundred miles out of <HI>England</HI> during the King's life. But the Hou&s;e was cold, and backward in all that matter. Tho&s;e that were really the Duke's friends abhorred all tho&s;e motions: And Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> and his party laughed at them: They were re|&s;olved to let all lie in confu&s;ion, rather than hearken to any thing be&s;ides the Exclu&s;ion. The Hou&s;e of Commons &s;eem|ed al&s;o to be &s;o &s;et again&s;t that project, that very little pro|gre&s;s was made in it. Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> made a motion, which was agreed to in a thin Hou&s;e: But it put an end to all di&s;|cour&s;es of that nature: He moved, that an a&s;&s;ociation &s;hould be entred into to maintain tho&s;e expedients, and that &s;ome cautionary Towns &s;hould be put into the hands of the a&s;&s;ocia|tors during the King's life to make them good after his death. The King looked on this as a depo&s;ing of him&s;elf. He had read more in <HI>Davila</HI> than in any other book of hi&s;tory: And he had a clear view into the con&s;equences of &s;uch things, and looked on this as wor&s;e than the Exclu&s;ion. So that, as Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> often ob&s;erved to me, this whole manage|ment looked like a de&s;ign to unite the King more entirely to the Duke, in&s;tead of &s;eparating him from him: The King came to think that he him&s;elf was levelled at chiefly, tho' for decency's &s;ake his brother was only named. The truth was, the leading men thought they were &s;ure of the Nation, and of all future elections, as long as Popery was in view. They fancied the King mu&s;t have a Parliament, and money from it very &s;oon, and that in conclu&s;ion he would come in to them. He was much be&s;et by all the hungry courtiers, who longed for a bill of money: They &s;tudied to per&s;uade him, from his Father's misfortunes, that the longer he was in yielding, the terms would grow the higher.</P>
<P>They relied much on the Lady <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI>'s intere&s;t, who <NOTE PLACE="marg">Du$span$ of <HI>P$span$</HI>'s conduct in this matter $word$ under|&s;tood.</NOTE> did openly declare her &s;elf for the Hou&s;e of Commons: And they were &s;o careful of her, that when one moved that an addre&s;s &s;hould be made to the King for &s;ending her away, he could not be heard, tho' at another time &s;uch a motion would have been better entertained. Her behaviour in this matter was unaccountable: And the Duke's behaviour to her
<PB N="487" REF="502">
afterwards looked liker an acknowledgment than a re&s;ent|ment. Many refined upon it, and thought &s;he was &s;et on as a decoy to keep the party up to the Exclu&s;ion, that they might not hearken to the limitations. The Duke was a&s;|&s;ured, that the King would not grant the one: And &s;o &s;he was artificially managed to keep them from the other, to which the King would have con&s;ented, and of which the Duke was mo&s;t afraid. But this was too fine: She was hear|ty for the Exclu&s;ion: Of which I had this particular account from <HI>Mountague,</HI> who I believe might be the per&s;on that laid the bait before her. It was propo&s;ed to her, that if &s;he could bring the King to the Exclu&s;ion, and to &s;ome other popular things, the Parliament would go next to prepare a bill for &s;ecuring the King's per&s;on; in which a clau&s;e might be carried, that the King might declare the Succe&s;&s;or to the Crown, as had been done in <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth's time. This would very much rai&s;e the King's authority, and would be no breach with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> but would rather oblige him to a greater dependance on the King. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and his party would certainly be for this clau&s;e, &s;ince he could have no pro&s;pect any other way; and he would plea&s;e him&s;elf with the hopes of being preferred by the King to any other per&s;on. But &s;ince the Lady <HI>Port&s;|mouth</HI> found &s;he was &s;o ab&s;olutely the mi&s;tre&s;s of the King's &s;pirit, &s;he might reckon, that if &s;uch an act could be carried the King would be prevailed on to declare her &s;on his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or: And it was &s;ugge&s;ted to her, that in order to the &s;trengthening her Son's intere&s;t &s;he ought to treat for a match with the King of <HI>France</HI>'s natural Daughter, now the Duche&s;s of <HI>Bourbon.</HI> And thus the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and &s;he were brought to an agreement to carry on the Exclu&s;ion, and that other act per&s;uant to it: And they thought they were mak|ing tools of one another to carry on their own ends. The Nation was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a di&s;tru&s;t of the King, that there was no rea&s;on to think they could ever be brought to &s;o entire a confidence in him, as to deliver up them&s;elves and their po&s;terity &s;o blindfold into his hands. <HI>Mountague</HI> a&s;&s;ured me, that &s;he not only acted heartily in this matter, but &s;he once drew the King to con&s;ent to it, if &s;he might have had 800000 <HI>l.</HI> for it: And that was afterwards brought down to 600000 <HI>l.</HI> But the jealou&s;ies upon the King him|&s;elf were &s;uch, that the managers in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons dur&s;t not move for giving money till the bill of Ex|clu&s;ion &s;hould pa&s;s, le&s;t they &s;hould have lo&s;t their credit by
<PB N="488" REF="503">
&s;uch a motion: And the King would not tru&s;t them. So near was this point brought to an agreement, if <HI>Montague</HI> told me true.</P>
<P>That which reconciled the Duke to the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;|mouth</HI> was, that the King a&s;&s;ured him, &s;he did all by his order, that &s;o &s;he might have credit with the party, and &s;ee into their de&s;igns: Upon which the Duke &s;aw it was nece&s;&s;ary to believe this, or at lea&s;t to &s;eem to believe it.</P>
<P>The other great bu&s;ine&s;s of this Parliament was the trial of the Vi&s;count of <HI>Stafford,</HI> who was the younger &s;on of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Stafford's <HI>Trial.</HI></NOTE> the old Earl of <HI>Arundell,</HI> and &s;o was uncle to the Duke of <HI>Norfolk.</HI> He was a weak, but a fair conditioned man: He was in ill terms with his nephew's family: And had been guilty of great vices in his youth, which had almo&s;t proved fatal to him: He married the heire&s;s of the great Family of the <HI>Staffords.</HI> He thought the King had not rewarded him for his former &s;ervices as he had de&s;erved: So he often voted again&s;t the Court, and made great applications always to the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury.</HI> He was in no good terms with the Duke; for the great con&s;ideration the Court had of his nephew's family made him to be the mo&s;t neglected: When <HI>Oates</HI> depo&s;ed fir&s;t again&s;t him, he happned to be out of the way: And he kept out a day longer. But the day after he came in, and delivered him&s;elf: Which, con&s;idering the feeblene&s;s of his temper, and the heat of that time, was thought a &s;ign of innocence. <HI>Oates</HI> and <HI>Bedlow</HI> &s;wore, he had a patent to be payma&s;ter general to the army, <HI>Dugdale</HI> &s;wore, that he offered him 500 <HI>l.</HI> to kill the King. <HI>Bedlow</HI> had died the &s;ummer before at <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> It was in the time of the a&s;&s;izes: <HI>North,</HI> Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas, being there, he &s;ent for him, and by oath confirmed all that he had &s;worn formerly, except that which related to the Queen, and to the Duke. He al&s;o denied upon oath, that any per|&s;on had ever practi&s;ed upon him, or corrupted him: His di&s;owning &s;ome of the particulars which he had &s;worn had an appearance of &s;incerity, and gave much credit to his for|mer depo&s;itions. I could never hear what &s;en&s;e he expre&s;&s;ed of the other ill parts of his life, for he vani&s;hed &s;oon out of all men's thoughts.</P>
<P>Another witne&s;s appeared again&s;t Lord <HI>Stafford,</HI> one <HI>Tur|bervill;</HI> who &s;wore, that in the year &s;eventy five the Lord <HI>Stafford</HI> had taken much pains to per&s;uade him to kill the King: He began the propo&s;ition to him at <HI>Paris;</HI> and &s;ent him by the way of <HI>Diep</HI> over to <HI>England,</HI> telling him that
<PB N="489" REF="504">
he intended to follow by the &s;ame road: But he wrote after|wards to him that he was to go by <HI>Calais.</HI> But he &s;aid he never went to &s;ee him upon his coming to <HI>England. Tur|bervill</HI> &s;wore the year wrong at fir&s;t: But upon recollection he went and corrected that error. This at &s;uch a di&s;tance of time &s;eemed to be no great matter: It &s;eemed much &s;tranger, that after &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es once begun he &s;hould never go near the Lord <HI>Stafford;</HI> and that Lord <HI>Stafford</HI> &s;hould never enquire after him. But there was a much more material objection to him. <HI>Turbervill,</HI> upon di&s;cour&s;e with &s;ome in St. <HI>Martin</HI>'s pari&s;h, &s;eemed inclined to change his Religion: They brought him to Dr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> then their mini&s;|ter: And he convinced him &s;o fully that he changed up|on it: And after that he came often to him, and was chiefly &s;upported by him: For &s;ome months he was con&s;tantly at his table. <HI>Lloyd</HI> had pre&s;&s;ed him to recollect all that he had heard among the Papi&s;ts relating to plots and de&s;igns again&s;t the King or the Nation. He &s;aid that which all the converts at that time &s;aid often, that they had it among them that within a very little while their Religion would be &s;et up in <HI>England;</HI> and that &s;ome of them &s;aid, a great deal of blood would be &s;hed before it could be brought about: But he prote&s;ted that he knew no particulars. After &s;ome months dependance on <HI>Lloyd</HI> he withdrew entirely from him; and he &s;aw him no more till he appeared now an evidence again&s;t Lord <HI>Stafford: Lloyd</HI> was in great difficulties upon that occa&s;ion. It had been often declared, that the mo&s;t &s;olemn denials of witne&s;&s;es before they make di&s;coveries did not at all invalidate their evidence; and that it imported no more, but that they had been &s;o long firm to their promi&s;e of re|vealing nothing: So that this negative evidence again&s;t <HI>Tur|bervill</HI> could have done Lord <HI>Stafford</HI> no &s;ervice. On the other hand, con&s;idering the load that already lay on <HI>Lloyd</HI> on the account of <HI>Berry</HI>'s bu&s;ine&s;s, and that his being a lit|tle before this time promoted to be Bi&s;hop of St. <HI>A&s;aph</HI> was imputed to that, it was vi&s;ible that his di&s;covering this again&s;t <HI>Turbervill</HI> would have aggravated tho&s;e cen&s;ures, and very much bla&s;ted him. In oppo&s;ition to all this here was a ju&s;|tice to be done, and a &s;ervice to truth, towards the &s;aving a man's life: And the que&s;tion was very hard to be deter|mined. He advi&s;ed with all his friends, and with my &s;elf in particular. The much greater number were of opinion that he ought to be &s;ilent. I &s;aid, my own behaviour in <HI>Staley</HI>'s affair &s;hewed what I would do if I was in that ca&s;e:
<PB N="490" REF="505">
But his circum&s;tances were very different: So I concurred with the re&s;t as to him. He had another load on him: He had writ a book with very &s;incere intentions, but upon a very tender point: He propo&s;ed, that a di&s;crimination &s;hould be made between the regular Prie&s;ts that were in a depen|dance and under directions from <HI>Rome,</HI> and the &s;ecular Prie&s;ts that would renounce the Pope's depo&s;ing power and his infallibility: He thought this would rai&s;e heats among them|&s;elves, and draw cen&s;ures from <HI>Rome</HI> on the &s;eculars, which in conclu&s;ion might have very good effects. This was very plau&s;ibly writ, and de&s;igned with great &s;incerity: But angry men &s;aid, all this was intended only to take off &s;o much from the apprehen&s;ions that the Nation had of Popery, and to give a milder idea of a great body among them: And as &s;oon as it had that effect, it was probable that all the mi&s;|&s;ionaries would have leave given them to put on that di&s;|gui&s;e, and to take tho&s;e di&s;criminating te&s;ts till they had once prevailed: And then they would throw them off. Thus the mo&s;t zealous man again&s;t Popery that I ever yet knew, and the man of the mo&s;t entire &s;incerity, was &s;o heavily cen&s;ured at this time, that it was not thought fit, nor in|deed &s;afe, for him to declare what he knew concerning <HI>Tur|bervill.</HI></P>
<P>The trial was very augu&s;t: The Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> was the Lord High Steward: It continued five days. On the fir&s;t day the Commons brought only general evidence to prove the plot: <HI>Smith</HI> &s;wore &s;ome things that had been &s;aid to him at <HI>Rome</HI> of killing the King: An <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Prie&s;t that had been long in <HI>Spain</HI> confirmed many particulars in <HI>Oates</HI>'s nar|rative: Then the witne&s;&s;es depo&s;ed all that related to the plot in general. To all this Lord <HI>Stafford</HI> &s;aid little, as not be|ing much concerned in it: Only he declared, that he was always again&s;t the Pope's power of depo&s;ing Princes. He al&s;o ob|&s;erved a great difference between the gunpowder plot and that which was now on foot: That in the former all the chief con&s;pirators died confe&s;&s;ing the fact; but that now all died with the &s;olemne&s;t prote&s;tations of their innocence. On the &s;econd day the evidence again&s;t him&s;elf was brought: He urged again&s;t <HI>Oates</HI> that he &s;wore he had gone in among them on de&s;ign to betray them: So that he had been for &s;ome years taking oaths and receiving &s;acraments in &s;o trea|cherous a manner, that no credit could be given to a man that was &s;o black by his own confe&s;&s;ion. On the third day be brought his evidence to di&s;credit the witne&s;&s;es: His &s;er|vant
<PB N="491" REF="506">
&s;wore, that while he was at the Lord <HI>A&s;ton</HI>'s <HI>Dugdale</HI> never was in his chamber but once; and that was on the account of a foot race. Some depo&s;ed again&s;t <HI>Dugdale</HI>'s re|putation: And one &s;aid, that he had been practi&s;ing on him|&s;elf to &s;wear as he &s;hould direct him. The mini&s;ter of the pari&s;h and another gentleman depo&s;ed, that they heard no|thing from <HI>Dugdale</HI> concerning the killing a Ju&s;tice of Peace in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> which, as he had &s;worn, he had &s;aid to them. As to <HI>Turbervill,</HI> who had &s;aid that the Lord <HI>Stafford</HI> was at that time in a fit of the gout, his &s;ervants &s;aid they never knew him in a fit of the gout: And he him&s;elf af|firmed, he never had one in his whole life. He al&s;o proved that he did not intend to come to <HI>England</HI> by <HI>Diep;</HI> for he had writ for a Yacht which met him at <HI>Calais.</HI> He al&s;o proved by &s;everal witne&s;&s;es, that both <HI>Dug|dale</HI> and <HI>Turbervill</HI> had often &s;aid that they knew nothing of any plot; and that <HI>Turbervill</HI> had lately &s;aid, he would &s;et up for a witne&s;s, for none lived &s;o well as witne&s;&s;es did: He in&s;i&s;ted likewi&s;e on the mi&s;take of the year, and on <HI>Turbervill</HI>'s never coming near him after he came over to <HI>England.</HI> The &s;tronge&s;t part of his defence was, that he made it out un|an&s;werably, that he was not at the Lord <HI>A&s;ton</HI>'s on one of the times that <HI>Dugdale</HI> had fixed on; for at that time he was either at <HI>Bath</HI> or at <HI>Badminton.</HI> For <HI>Dugdale</HI> had once fixed on a day; tho' afterwards he &s;aid it was about that time: Now that day happned to be the Marquis of <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter</HI>'s wedding day: And on that day it was fully proved that he was at <HI>Badminton,</HI> that Lord's hou&s;e, not far from the <HI>Bath.</HI> On the fourth day proofs were brought to &s;up|port the credit of the witne&s;&s;es: It was made out, that <HI>Dug|dale</HI> had &s;erved the Lord <HI>A&s;ton</HI> long and with great repu|tation. It was now two full years &s;ince he began to make di&s;coveries: And in all that time they had not found any one particular to blemi&s;h him with; tho' no doubt they had taken pains to examine into his life. His publi&s;hing the news of <HI>Godfrey</HI>'s death was well made out, tho' two per&s;ons in the company had not minded it: Many proofs were brought that he was often in Lord <HI>Stafford</HI>'s company, of which many more affidavits were made after that Lord's death. Two women that were &s;till Papi&s;ts &s;wore, that upon the breaking out of the plot he &s;earched into many papers and burnt them: He gave many of the&s;e to one of the women to fling in the fire; but finding a book of accounts he laid that a&s;ide, &s;aying, there is no trea&s;on
<PB N="492" REF="507">
here, which imported that he thought the others were trea|&s;onable. He proved that one of the witne&s;&s;es brought again&s;t him was &s;o infamous in all re&s;pects, that Lord <HI>Staf|ford</HI> him&s;elf was convinced of it. He &s;aid, he had only pre&s;&s;ed a man, who now appeared again&s;t him, to di&s;cover all he knew: He &s;aid, at &s;uch a di&s;tance of time he might mi&s;take as to time or a day; but could not be mi&s;taken as to the things them&s;elves. <HI>Turbervill</HI> de&s;cribed both the &s;treet and the room in <HI>Paris</HI> in which he &s;aw Lord <HI>Stafford.</HI> He found a witne&s;s that &s;aw him at <HI>Diep,</HI> to whom he com|plained, that a Lord for whom he looked had failed him: And upon that he &s;aid he was no good &s;taff to lean on; by which, tho' he did not name the Lord, he believed he meant Lord <HI>Stafford. Dugdale</HI> and he both confe&s;&s;ed they had denied long that they knew any thing of the plot, which was the effect of the re&s;olution they had taken, to which they adhered long, of di&s;covering nothing: It was al&s;o prov|ed that Lord <HI>Stafford</HI> was often lame, which <HI>Turbervill</HI> took for the gout. On the fifth day Lord <HI>Stafford</HI> re&s;umed all his evidence, and urged every particular very &s;trongly. <HI>Jones</HI> in the name of the Commons did on the other hand re|&s;ume the evidence again&s;t him with great force: He &s;aid indeed nothing for &s;upporting <HI>Oates;</HI> for the objection again&s;t him was not to be an&s;wered. He made it very clear that <HI>Dug|dale</HI> and <HI>Turbervill</HI> were two good witne&s;&s;es, and were not at all di&s;credited by any thing that was brought again&s;t them. When it came to the giving of judgment, above fifty of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">He was con|demned.</NOTE> Peers gave it again&s;t Lord <HI>Stafford,</HI> and above thirty acquit|ted him: Four of the <HI>Howards,</HI> his kin&s;men, condemned him: Lord <HI>Arundell,</HI> afterwards Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> tho' in enmity with him, did acquit him. Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> condemn|ed him: And &s;o did both the Earls of <HI>Nottingham</HI> and <HI>An|gle&s;ey.</HI> Lord <HI>Hali&s;ax</HI> acquitted him. Lord <HI>Nottingham</HI> when he gave judgement delivered it with one of the be&s;t &s;peeches he had ever made. But he committed one great indecency in it: For he &s;aid, who can doubt any longer that <HI>London</HI> was burnt by Papi&s;ts, tho' there was not one word in the whole trial relating to that matter. Lord <HI>Stafford</HI> behaved him&s;elf during the whole time, and at the receiving his &s;entence, with much more con&s;tancy than was expected from him.</P>
<P>Within two days after he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the Lords, <NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ &s;ent for &s;he, and em|ployed me $span$ $word$ $word$</NOTE> de&s;iring that the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> and I might be appointed to come to him. We waited on him: His de&s;ign &s;eemed to
<PB N="493" REF="508">
be only to po&s;&s;e&s;s us with an opinion of his innocence, of which he made very &s;olemn prote&s;tations. He heard us &s;peak of the points in difference between us and the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> with great temper and attention. At parting he de|&s;ired me to come back to him next day; for he had a mind to be more particular with me. When I came to him, he repeated the prote&s;tations of his innocence; and &s;aid, he was confident the villany of the witne&s;&s;es would &s;oon appear: He did not doubt I &s;hould &s;ee it in le&s;s than a year. I pre&s;|&s;ed him in &s;everal points of Religion; and urged &s;everal things, which he &s;aid he had never heard before. He &s;aid, the&s;e things on another occa&s;ion would have made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion upon him; but he had now little time, therefore he would loo&s;e none in controver&s;y: So I let that di&s;cour&s;e fall. I talked to him of tho&s;e preparations for death in which all Chri&s;tians agree: He entertained the&s;e very &s;eriou&s;ly. He had a mind to live, if it was po&s;&s;ible: He &s;aid, he could di&s;cover nothing with relation to the King's life, prote&s;t|ing that there was not &s;o much as an intimation about it that had ever pa&s;t among them. But he added, that he could di&s;|cover many other things, that were more material than any thing that was yet known, and for which the Duke would never forgive him: And of the&s;e, if that might &s;ave his life, he would make a full di&s;covery. I &s;topt him when he was go|ing on to particulars; for I would not be a confident in any thing in which the publick &s;afety was concerned. He knew be&s;t the importance of tho&s;e &s;ecrets; and &s;o he could only judge, whether it would be of that value as to prevail with the two Hou&s;es to interpo&s;e with the King for his pardon. He &s;eemed to think it would be of great u&s;e, chiefly to &s;up|port what they were then driving on with relation to the Duke: He de&s;ired me to &s;peak to Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Jones.</HI> I brought him their an&s;wer the next day; which was, that if he did di&s;cover all he knew con|cerning the Papi&s;t's de&s;igns, and more particularly concern|ing the Duke, they would endeavour that it &s;hould not be in&s;i&s;ted on, that he mu&s;t confe&s;s tho&s;e particulars for which he was judged. He a&s;ked me, what if he &s;hould name &s;ome who had now great credit, but had once engaged to &s;erve their de&s;igns: I &s;aid, nothing could be more acceptable than the di&s;covering &s;uch di&s;gui&s;ed Papi&s;ts, or fal&s;e Prote&s;tants: Yet upon this I charged him &s;olemnly not to think of re|deeming his own life by accu&s;ing any other fal&s;ly, but to tell the truth, and all the truth, as far as the common &s;afety
<PB N="494" REF="509">
was concerned in it. As we were di&s;cour&s;ing of the&s;e mat|ters, the Earl of <HI>Carlile</HI> came in: In his hearing, by Lord <HI>Stafford</HI>'s leave, I went over all that had pa&s;&s;ed between us, and did again &s;olemnly adjure him to &s;ay nothing but the truth. Upon this he de&s;ired the Earl of <HI>Carlile</HI> to carry a me&s;&s;age from him to the Hou&s;e of Lords, that when&s;oever they would &s;end for him he would di&s;cover all that he knew: Upon that he was immediately &s;ent for. And he be|gan with a long relation of their fir&s;t con&s;ultations after the Re&s;toration about the methods of bringing in their Religi|on, which they all agreed could only be brought about by a toleration. He told them of the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>'s pro|ject; and went on to tell who had undertaken to procure the toleration for them: And then he named the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury.</HI> When he named him he was ordered to with|draw: And the Lords would hear no more from him. It was al&s;o given out, that in this I was a Tool of Lord <HI>Hali|fax</HI>'s to bring him thither to bla&s;t Lord <HI>Shaftsbury.</HI> He was &s;ent back to the Tower: And then he compo&s;ed him&s;elf in the be&s;t way he could to &s;uffer, which he did with a con&s;tant and undi&s;turbed mind: He &s;upped and &s;lept well the night <NOTE PLACE="marg">His execu|tion.</NOTE> before his execution, and died without any &s;hew of fear or di&s;order. He denied all that the witne&s;&s;es had &s;worn again&s;t him. And this was the end of the plot. I was very unju&s;t|ly cen&s;ured on both hands. The Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> railed &s;o at me that I went no more near him. And the Duke was made believe, that I had per&s;uaded Lord <HI>Stafford</HI> to charge him, and to di&s;cover all he knew again&s;t him: Which was the beginning of the implacable hatred he &s;hewed on many occa&s;ions again&s;t me. Thus the innocente&s;t and be&s;t meant parts of a man's life may be mi&s;under&s;tood, and highly cen|&s;ured.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons had another bu&s;ine&s;s before them in this &s;e&s;&s;ion: There was a &s;evere act pa&s;t in the end of <NOTE PLACE="marg">1681 Motions in the favour of the Non|confo$span$</NOTE> Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s reign, when &s;he was highly provoked with the &s;editious behaviour of the <HI>Puritans,</HI> by which tho&s;e who did not conform to the Church were required to abjure the Kingdom under the pain of death: And for &s;ome degrees of Non-conformity they were adjudged to die, without the favour of bani&s;hment. Both Hou&s;es pa&s;t a bill for repealing this act: It went indeed heavily in the Hou&s;e of Lords; for many of the Bi&s;hops, tho' they were not for putting that law in execution, which had never been done but in one &s;ingle in&s;tance, yet they thought the terror of it was of &s;ome
<PB N="495" REF="510">
u&s;e, and that the repealing it might make the party more in&s;olent. On the day of the prorogation the bill ought to have been offered to the King, but the Clerk of the Crown, by the King's particular order, withdrew the bill. The King had no mind openly to deny it: But he had le&s;s mind to pa&s;s it. So this indi&s;creet method was taken, which was a high offence in the Clerk of the Crown. There was a bill of comprehen&s;ion offered by the epi&s;copal party in the Hou&s;e of Commons, by which the Pre&s;byterians would have been taken into the Church. But to the amaze|ment of all people their party in the Hou&s;e did not &s;eem concerned to promote it: On the contrary they neglected it. This increa&s;ed the jealou&s;y, as if they had hoped they were &s;o near the carrying all before them, that they de&s;pi&s;ed a comprehen&s;ion: There was no great progre&s;s made in this bill. But in the morning before they were prorogued two votes were carried in the Hou&s;e of a very extraordinary na|ture: The one was, that the laws made again&s;t recu&s;ants ought not to be executed again&s;t any but tho&s;e of the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> That was indeed the primary intention of the law: Yet all per&s;ons who came not to Church, and did not receive the &s;acrament once a year, were within the letter of the law. The other vote was, that it was the opinion of that Hou&s;e, that the laws again&s;t Di&s;&s;enters ought not to be executed. This was thought a great inva&s;ion of the Legi&s;la|ture, when one Hou&s;e pretended to &s;u&s;pend the execution of laws: Which was to act like dictators in the State; for they meant that Courts and Juries &s;hould govern them&s;elves by the opinion that they now gave: Which, in&s;tead of being a kindne&s;s to the Non-conformi&s;ts, rai&s;ed a new &s;torm again&s;t them over all the Nation. When the King &s;aw no hope of prevailing with the Commons on any other terms, but his granting the Exclu&s;ion, he re&s;olved to prorogue the Par|liament. And it was di&s;&s;olved in a few days after, in <HI>January</HI> eighty one.</P>
<P>The King re&s;olved to try a Parliament once more: But <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment was di&s;&s;olved.</NOTE> apprehending that they were encouraged, if not inflamed by the city of <HI>London,</HI> he &s;ummoned the next Parliament to meet at <HI>Oxford.</HI> It was &s;aid, men were now very bold about <HI>London,</HI> by their confidence in the Juries that the Sheriffs took care to return. Several printers were indited for &s;can|dalous libels that they had printed: But the Grand Juries returned an <HI>Ignoramus</HI> upon the bills again&s;t them, on this pretence, that the law only condemned the printing &s;uch
<PB N="496" REF="511">
libels maliciou&s;ly and &s;editiou&s;ly, and that it did not ap|pear that the Printers had any ill intentions in what they did; whereas, if it was found that they printed &s;uch libels, the con&s;truction of law made that to be malicious and &s;edi|tious. The elections over <HI>England</HI> for the new Parliament went generally for the &s;ame per&s;ons that had &s;erved in the former Parliament: And in many places it was given as an in&s;truction to the members to &s;tick to the bill of Ex|clu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The King was now very unea&s;y: He &s;aw he was de&s;pi&s;ed all <HI>Europe</HI> over, as a Prince that had neither trea&s;ure nor power: So one attempt more was to be made, which was to be managed chiefly by <HI>Littleton,</HI> who was now brought into the commi&s;&s;ion of the Admiralty. I had once in a long di&s;cour&s;e with him argued again&s;t the expedients, be|cau&s;e they did really reduce us to the &s;tate of a Common|wealth. I thought a much better way was, that there &s;hould be a Protector declared, with whom the regal power &s;hould be lodged; and that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;hould be the per|&s;on. <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new expe|pedient of a Prince Re|gent.</NOTE> He approved the notion: But thought that the title Protector was odious, &s;ince <HI>Cromwell</HI> had a&s;&s;umed it, and that therefore Regent would be better: We dre&s;&s;ed up a &s;cheme of this for near two hours: And I dreamt no more of it. But &s;ome days after he told me the notion took with &s;ome, and that both Lord <HI>Hali&s;ax</HI> and <HI>Seymour</HI> liked it: But he wondered to find Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI> did not go into it. He told me after the Parliament was di&s;&s;olved, but in great &s;e|crecy, that the King him&s;elf liked it. Lord <HI>Nottingham</HI> talk|ed in a general and odd &s;train about it. He gave it out, that the King was re&s;olved to offer one expedient, which was beyond any thing that the Parliament could have the confidence to a&s;k. <HI>Littleton</HI> pre&s;&s;ed me to do what I could to promote it; and &s;aid, that as I was the fir&s;t that had &s;ug|ge&s;ted it, &s;o I &s;hould have the honour of it, if it proved &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as to procure the quieting of the Nation. I argued upon it with <HI>Jones:</HI> But I found they had laid it down for a maxim, to hearken to nothing but the Exclu&s;ion. All the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s party looked on this as that which mu&s;t put an end to all his hopes. Others thought, in point of ho|nour they mu&s;t go on as they had done hitherto: <HI>Jones</HI> &s;tood upon a point of law, of the un&s;eparablene&s;s of the prerogative from the per&s;on of the King. He &s;aid, an in|fant or a lunatick was in a real incapacity of &s;truggling with his guardians; but that if it was not &s;o, the law that
<PB N="497" REF="512">
con&s;tituted their guardians would be of no force. He &s;aid, if the Duke came to be King, the prerogative would by that ve&s;t in him; and the Prince Regent and he mu&s;t either &s;trike up a bar|gain, or it mu&s;t end in a civil war, in which he believed the force of law would give the King the better of it. It was not to be denied but that there was &s;ome danger in this: But in the ill circum&s;tances in which we were no remedies could be propo&s;ed that were without great inconveniences. and that were not liable to much danger. In the mean while both &s;ides were taking all the pains they could to fortify their party: And it was very vi&s;ible, that the &s;ide which was for the Exclu&s;ion was like to be the &s;tronge&s;t.</P>
<P>A few days before the King went to <HI>Oxford Fitzharris</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fitzharris</HI> was taken</NOTE> an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Papi&s;t, was taken up for framing a malicious and trea&s;onable libel again&s;t the King and his whole Family. He had met with one <HI>Everard,</HI> who pretended to make di&s;co|veries, and as was thought had mixed a great deal of fal&s;e|hood with &s;ome truth: But he held him&s;elf in general terms, and did not de&s;cent to &s;o many particulars as the witne&s;&s;es had done. <HI>Fitzharris</HI> and he had been acquainted in <HI>France:</HI> So on that confidence he &s;hewed him his libel: And he made an appointment to come to <HI>Everard</HI>'s chamber, who thought he intended to trepann him, and &s;o had placed witne&s;&s;es to overhear all that pa&s;t. <HI>Fitzharris</HI> left the libel with him, all writ in his own hand: <HI>Everard</HI> went with the paper and with his witne&s;&s;es and informed again&s;t <HI>Fitzharris,</HI> who upon that was committed. But &s;eeing the proof again&s;t him was like to be full, he &s;aid, the libel was drawn by <HI>Everard,</HI> and only copied by him&s;elf: But he had no &s;ort of proof to &s;upport this. <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> the Sheriff going to &s;ee him, he de&s;ired he would bring him a Ju&s;tice of Peace; for he could make a great di&s;covery of the plot, far beyond all that was yet known. <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> in the &s;implicity of his heart went and acquainted the King with this: For which he was much blamed; for it was &s;aid, by this means that di&s;covery might have been &s;topt: But his going fir&s;t with it to the Court proved afterwards a great happine&s;s both to him&s;elf and to many others. The Secretaries and &s;ome privy Coun&s;ellors were upon that &s;ent to examine <HI>Fitzharris;</HI> to whom he gave a long relation of a practice to kill the King, in which the Duke was concerned, with many other particulars which need not be mentioned; for it was all a fiction. The Secretaries came to him a &s;econd time to ex|amine him farther: He boldly &s;tood to all he had &s;aid: And
<PB N="498" REF="513">
he de&s;ired that &s;ome Ju&s;tices of the City might be brought to him. So <HI>Clayton</HI> and <HI>Treby</HI> went to him: And he made the &s;ame pretended di&s;covery to them over again; and in&s;i|nuated, that he was glad it was now in &s;afe hands that would not &s;tifle it. The King was highly offended with this, &s;ince it plainly &s;hewed a di&s;tru&s;t of his mini&s;ters: And &s;o <HI>Fitzharris</HI> was removed to the Tower; which the Court re&s;olved to make the pri&s;on for all offenders, till there &s;hould be Sheriffs cho&s;en more at the King's devotion. Yet the depo&s;ition made to <HI>Clayton</HI> and <HI>Treby</HI> was in all points the &s;ame that he had made to the Secretaries: So that there was no colour for the pretence afterward put on this, as if they had prac|ti&s;ed on him.</P>
<P>The Parliament met at <HI>Oxford</HI> in <HI>March:</HI> The King opened <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment of <HI>Ox|ford</HI> was &s;oon di&s;|&s;olved.</NOTE> it with &s;evere reflections on the proceedings of the former Parliament. He &s;aid, he was re&s;olved to maintain the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of the Crown in the right line: But for quieting his peoples fears he was willing to put the admini&s;tration of the government into Prote&s;tant's hands. This was explained by <HI>Ernely</HI> and <HI>Littleton</HI> to be meant of a Prince Regent, with whom the regal prerogative &s;hould be lodged during the Duke's life. <HI>Jones</HI> and <HI>Littleton</HI> managed the debate on the grounds formerly mentioned: But in the end the propo&s;iti|on was rejected; and they re&s;olved to go again to the bill of Exclu&s;ion, to the great joy of the Duke's party, who declar|ed them&s;elves more again&s;t this than again&s;t the Exclu&s;ion it &s;elf. The Commons re&s;olved likewi&s;e to take the manage|ment of <HI>Fitzharris</HI>'s affair out of the hands of the Court: So they carried to the Lords bar an impeachment again&s;t him, which was rejected by the Lords upon a pretence with which Lord <HI>Nottingham</HI> furni&s;hed them. It was this: <HI>Edward</HI> the third had got &s;ome Commoners to be condemned by the Lords; of which when the Hou&s;e of Commons complained, an order was made, that no &s;uch thing &s;hould be done for the future. Now that related only to proceedings at the King's &s;uit: But it could not be meant, that an impeach|ment from the Commons did not lie again&s;t a Commoner. Judges, Secretaries of State, and the Lord Keeper were of|ten Commoners: So if this was good law, here was a certain method offered to the Court, to be troubled no more with impeachments, by employing only Commoners. In &s;hort, the Peers &s;aw the de&s;ign of this impeachment, and were re&s;olved not to receive it: And &s;o made u&s;e of this colour to reject it. Upon that the Commons pa&s;t a vote, that
<PB N="499" REF="514">
ju&s;tice was denied them by the Lords: And they al&s;o voted, that all tho&s;e who concurred in any &s;ort in trying <HI>Fitzharris</HI> in any other Court were betrayers of the liberties of their Country. By the&s;e &s;teps which they had already made the King &s;aw what might be expected from them: So very &s;ud|denly, and not very decently, he came to the Hou&s;e of Lords, the Crown being carried between his feet in a &s;edan: And he put on his robes in ha&s;t, without any previous no|tice, and called up the Commons, and di&s;&s;olved the Parliament; and went with &s;uch ha&s;t to <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> that it looked as if he was afraid of the crouds that this meeting had brought to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately upon this the Court took a new ply; and things <NOTE PLACE="marg">A great change in affairs.</NOTE> went in another channel: Of which I go next to give as im|partial an account, as I have hitherto given of the plot, and of all that related to it. At this time the di&s;tingui&s;hing names of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> came to be the denominations of the parties. I have given a full account of all errors during this time with the more exactne&s;s, to warn po&s;terity from falling into the like exce&s;&s;es, and to make it appear how mad and fatal a thing it is to run violently into a torrent, and in a heat to do tho&s;e things which may give a general di&s;gu&s;t, and to &s;et precedents to others, when times turn, to ju&s;tify their exce&s;&s;es, by &s;aying they do only follow the &s;teps of tho&s;e who went before them. The &s;hedding &s;o much blood upon &s;uch doubtful evidence was like to have proved fatal to him who drove all the&s;e things on with the greate&s;t fury: I mean the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> him&s;elf. And the &s;trange change that appeared over the Nation with relation to the Duke, from &s;uch an eager pro&s;ecution of the Exclu&s;ion to an indecent courting and magnifying him, not without a vi&s;ible cold|ne&s;s towards the King in compari&s;on of him, &s;hewed how little men could build on popular heats, which have their ebbings and flowings, and their hot and cold fits, almo&s;t as certainly as &s;eas or fevers have. When &s;uch changes hap|pen, tho&s;e who have been as to the main with the &s;ide that is run down will be charged with all the errors of their &s;ide, how much &s;oever they may have oppo&s;ed them. I who had been always in di&s;tru&s;t of the witne&s;&s;es, and di&s;&s;atisfied with the whole method of proceedings, yet came to be fallen on not only in pamphlets and poems, but even in &s;ermons, as if I had been an incendiary, and a main &s;tickler again&s;t the Court, and in particular again&s;t the Duke. So upon this I went into a clo&s;er retirement: And to keep my mind from

<P>The King &s;et out a declaration for &s;atisfying his people. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's declaration.</NOTE> He reckoned up in it all the hard things that had been done by the three la&s;t Parliaments; and &s;et out their undutiful beha|viour to him&s;elf in many in&s;tances: Yet in conclu&s;ion he a&s;&s;ured his good &s;ubjects, that nothing &s;hould ever alter his affection to the Prote&s;tant Religion as e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, nor his love to Parliament$span$ For he would have &s;till fre|quent Parliaments. When this pa&s;t in Council, the Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> moved, that an order &s;hould be added to it, requiring the Clergy to publi&s;h it in all the Churches of <HI>England:</HI> This was looked on as a mo&s;t pernicious pre|cedent, by which the Clergy were made the heralds to pub|li&s;h the King's declarations, which in &s;ome in&s;tances might come to be not only indecent but mi&s;chievous. An an&s;wer was writ to the King's declaration with great &s;pirit and true judgment. It was at fir&s;t penned by <HI>Sidney:</HI> But a new draught was made by <HI>Somers,</HI> and corrected by <HI>Jones.</HI> The &s;pirit of that &s;ide was now &s;pent: So that this, tho' the be&s;t writ paper in all that time, yet had no great effect. The declaration rai&s;ed over <HI>England</HI> a humour of making addre&s;&s;es <NOTE PLACE="marg">Addre&s;&s;es to the King from all parts of <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> to the King, as it were in an&s;wer to it. The Grand Juries and the bench of Ju&s;tices in the counties, the cities and bo|roughs, the franchi&s;es and corporations, many mannors, the companies in towns, and at la&s;t the very apprentices &s;ent up addre&s;&s;es. Of the&s;e &s;ome were more mode&s;tly penned, and only expre&s;&s;ed their joy at the a&s;&s;urances they &s;aw in the King's declaration; and concluded, that they upon that de|dicated their lives and fortunes to his &s;ervice. But the greater number, and the mo&s;t acceptable, were tho&s;e who declared they would adhere to the unalterable &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown in the lineal and legal de&s;cent, and condemned the bill of Exclu&s;ion. Others went higher, and arraigned the late Par|liaments as guilty of &s;edition and trea&s;on. Some reflected &s;everely on the Non-conformi&s;ts; and thanked the King for
<PB N="501" REF="516">
his not repealing that act of the thirty fifth of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> which they prayed might be put in execution. Some of the addre&s;&s;es were very high panegyrioks, in which the King's per&s;on and government were much magnified. Many of tho&s;e who brought the&s;e up were knighted upon it: And all were well treated at Court. Many zealous healths were drunk among them: And in their cups the old valour and the &s;waggerings of the Cavaliers &s;eemed to be revived. The Mini&s;ters &s;aw thro' this, and that it was an empty noi&s;e, and a fal&s;e &s;hew. But it was thought nece&s;&s;ary then to encourage it. Tho' Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> could not re&s;train him&s;elf from &s;hewing his contempt of it, in a &s;aying that was much repeated: He &s;aid, the petitioners for a Parliament &s;pit in the King's face, but the addre&s;&s;ers &s;pit in his mouth. As the country &s;ent up ad|dre&s;&s;es, &s;o the town &s;ent down pamphlets of all &s;orts, to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Nation much again&s;t the late Parliament: And the Clergy &s;truck up to a high$span$ with &s;uch zeal for the Duke's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as if a Popi&s;h King had been a &s;pe|cial ble&s;&s;ing from heaven, to be much longed for by a Pro|te&s;tant Church. They likewi&s;e gave them&s;elves &s;uch a loo&s;e again&s;t Non-conformi&s;ts, as if nothing was &s;o formidable as that party: So that in all their &s;ermons Popery was quite forgot, and the force of their zeal was turned almo&s;t wholly again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters; who were now by order from the Court to be proceeded again&s;t according to law. There was al&s;o a great change made in the commi&s;&s;ions all <HI>Eng|land</HI> over: None were left either on the Bench, or in the Militia, that did not with zeal go into the humour of the Court. And &s;uch of the Clergy as would not engage in that fury were cried out upon as the betrayers of the Church, and as &s;ecret favourers of the Di&s;&s;enters. The truth is, the num|bers of the&s;e were not great: One ob&s;erved right, that, ac|cording to the proverb in the Go&s;pel, <HI>where the carca&s;e is the Eagles will be gathered together:</HI> The &s;cent of preferment will draw a&s;piring men after it.</P>
<P><HI>Fitzharris</HI>'s trial came on in <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> Term: <HI>Scroggs</HI> was turned <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fitzharris</HI>'s trial.</NOTE> out, and <HI>Pemberton</HI> was made Chief Ju&s;tice. His ri&s;e was &s;o particular, that it is worth the being remembred: In his youth he mixed with &s;uch lewd company that he quickly &s;pent all he had; and ran &s;o deep in debt that he was ca&s;t into a jayl, where he lay many years: But he followed his &s;tudies &s;o clo&s;e in the jayl, that he became one of the able&s;t men of his profe&s;&s;ion. He was not wholly for the Court: He had been a Judge before, and was turned out by <HI>Scroggs</HI>'s
<PB N="502" REF="517">
means: And now he was rai&s;ed again, and was afterwards made Chief Ju&s;tice of the other Bench: But not being compliant enough, he was turned out a &s;econd time, when the Court would be &s;erved by none but by men of a thorough paced ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s. <HI>Fitzharris</HI> pleaded the impeachment in Par|liament: But &s;ince the Lords had thrown that out it was over-ruled. He pretended he could di&s;cover the &s;ecret of <HI>Godfrey</HI>'s murder: He &s;aid, he heard the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> &s;ay at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> that it mu&s;t be done: But when the Judge told the Grand Jury, that what was &s;aid at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> did not lie before them, <HI>Fitzharris</HI> immediately &s;aid, he had heard him &s;ay the &s;ame thing at <HI>Whitehall.</HI> This was very gro&s;s: Yet upon &s;o &s;light an evidence they found the bill again&s;t the Lord <HI>Danby.</HI> And when they were reproached with it, they &s;aid a dubious evidence was a &s;ufficient ground for a Grand Jury: Yet another doctrine was &s;et up by the &s;ame &s;ort of men within a few months.</P>
<P><HI>Plunket,</HI> the Popi&s;h Primate of <HI>Armagh,</HI> was at this time <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Plunket</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hop condemned and exe|cuted.</NOTE> brought to his trial. Some lewd <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Prie&s;ts, and others of that Nation, hearing that <HI>England</HI> was at that time di&s;po&s;ed to hearken to good &s;wearers, thought them&s;elves well quali|fied for the employment: So they came over to &s;wear, that there was a great plot in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to bring over a <HI>French</HI> army, and to ma&s;&s;acre all the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The witne&s;&s;es were brutal and profligate men: Yet the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> che|ri&s;hed them much: They were examined by the Parliament at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter:</HI> And what they &s;aid was believed. Upon that encouragement it was reckoned that we &s;hould have witne&s;&s;es come over in whole companies. Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> told me, that this <HI>Plunket</HI> was a wi&s;e and &s;ober man, who was always in a different intere&s;t from the two <HI>Talbots;</HI> the one of the&s;e being the titular Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Dublin,</HI> and the other rai&s;ed afterwards to be Duke of <HI>Tirconnell.</HI> The&s;e were medling and factious men; whereas <HI>Plunket</HI> was for their living quietly, and in due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the government, without engaging in|to intrigues of State. Some of the&s;e Prie&s;ts had been cen|&s;ured by him for their lewdne&s;s: And they drew others to &s;wear as they directed them. They had appeared the win|ter before upon a bill offered to the Grand Jury: But as the foreman of the Jury, who was a zealous Prote&s;tant, told me, they contradicted one another &s;o evidently, that they would not find the bill. But now they laid their &s;tory better toge|ther; and &s;wore again&s;t <HI>Plunket,</HI> that he had got a great bank of money to be prepared, and that he had an army
<PB N="503" REF="518">
li&s;ted, and was in a corre&s;pondence with <HI>France</HI> to bring over a fleet from thence. He had nothing to &s;ay in his own defence, but to deny all: So he was condemned; and &s;uffered very decently, expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in many particu|lars as became a Bi&s;hop. He died denying every thing that had been &s;worn again&s;t him.</P>
<P><HI>Fitzharris</HI> was tried next: And the proof was &s;o full that he was ca&s;t. He moved in Court that I might be ordered to come to him, upon what rea&s;on I could never imagine: A rule was made that I might &s;peak to him in the pre&s;ence of the Lieutenant of the Tower. I went to him, and pre&s;&s;ed him vehemently to tell the truth, and not to deceive him|&s;elf with fal&s;e hopes. I charged him with the improbabili|ties of his di&s;covery; and laid home to him the &s;in of per|jury, chiefly in matters of blood, &s;o fully, that the Lieute|nant of the Tower made a very ju&s;t report of it to the King, as the King him&s;elf told me afterwards. When he &s;aw there was no hope, he &s;aid the Lord <HI>Howard</HI> was the author of the libel. <HI>Howard</HI> was &s;o ill thought of, that, it being known that there was a familiarity between <HI>Fitzharris</HI> and him, it was apprehended from the beginning that he was concerned in it. I had &s;een him in Lord <HI>Howard</HI>'s company, and had told him how indecent it was to have &s;uch a man about him: He &s;aid he was in want, and was as hone&s;t as his Reli|gion would &s;uffer him to be. I found out afterwards, that he was a &s;py of the Lady <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI>'s: And that he had car|ried Lord <HI>Howard</HI> to her: And, as Lord <HI>Howard</HI> him&s;elf told me, &s;he brought the King to talk with him twice or thrice. The King, as he &s;aid, entred into a particular &s;cheme with him of the new frame of his Mini&s;try in ca&s;e of an agree|ment, which &s;eemed to him to be very near. As &s;oon as I &s;aw the libel I was &s;atisfied that Lord <HI>Howard</HI> was not concerned in it: It was &s;o ill drawn, and &s;o little di&s;gui&s;ed in the trea&s;onable part, that none but a man of the lowe&s;t form could be capable of making it. The report of Lord <HI>Howard</HI>'s being charged with this was over the whole Town a day before any warrant was &s;ent out again&s;t him; which made it appear, that the Court had a mind to give him time to go out of the way. He came to me, and &s;olemnly vowed he was not at all concerned in that matter: So I ad|vi&s;ed him not to &s;tir from home. He was committed that night: I had no liking to the man's temper: Yet he in&s;i|nuated him&s;elf &s;o into me, that without being rude to him it was not po&s;&s;ible to avoid him. He was a man of a plea&s;ant
<PB N="504" REF="519">
conver&s;ation: But he railed &s;o indecently both at the King and the Clergy, that I was very unea&s;y in his company: Yet now, during his impri&s;onment, I did him all the &s;ervice I could. But <HI>Algernoon Sidney</HI> took his concerns and his fa|mily &s;o to heart, and managed every thing relating to him with that zeal, and that care, that none but a mon&s;ter of ingratitude could have made him the return that he did af|terwards. When the bill again&s;t Lord <HI>Howard</HI> was brought to the Grand Jury, <HI>Fitzharris</HI>'s wife and maid were the two witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him: But they did &s;o evidently for&s;wear them&s;elves, that the Attorney General withdrew it. Lord <HI>Howard</HI> lay in the Tower till the Michaelmas term; and came out by the <HI>Habeas Corpus.</HI> I went no more to <HI>Fitz|harris:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Practices up|on <HI>Fitzharris</HI> at his death.</NOTE> But <HI>Hawkins</HI> the Mini&s;ter of the Tower took him into his management; and prevailed with him not only to deny all his former di&s;covery, but to lay it on <HI>Clayton, Treby,</HI> and the Sheriffs, as a &s;ubornation of theirs, tho' it was evident that was impo&s;&s;ible to be true. Yet at the &s;ame time he writ letters to his wife, who was not then admitted to him, which I &s;aw and read, in which he told her, how he was practi&s;ed upon with the hopes of life. He charged her to &s;wear fal&s;ly again&s;t none: One of the&s;e was writ that very morning in which he &s;uffered: And yet be|fore he was led out he &s;igned a new paper containing the former charge of &s;ubornation, and put it in <HI>Hawkins</HI>'s hands. And at <HI>Tyburn</HI> he referred all he had to &s;ay to that paper, which was immediately publi&s;hed: But the fal&s;hood of it was &s;o very notorious, that it &s;hewed what a &s;ort of man <HI>Hawkins</HI> was: Yet he was &s;oon after rewarded for this with the Deanry of <HI>Chiche&s;ter.</HI> But when the Court heard what letters <HI>Fitzharris</HI> had writ to his wife they were confound|ed: And all further di&s;cour&s;e about him was &s;tifled. But the Court practi&s;ed on her by the promi&s;e of a pen&s;ion &s;o far, that &s;he delivered up her hu&s;band's letters to them. But &s;o many had &s;een them before that, that this ba&s;e practice turned much to the reproach of all their proceedings.</P>
<P>Soon after this <HI>Dugdale, Turbervill, Smith,</HI> and the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Prote&s;tant plot.</NOTE> witne&s;&s;es came under another management; and they di&s;co|vered a plot laid again&s;t the King to be executed at <HI>Oxford.</HI> The King was to be killed, and the government was to be changed. One <HI>Colledge,</HI> a Joyner by trade, was an active and hot man, and came to be known by the name of the Pro|te&s;tant Joyner. He was fir&s;t &s;eized on: And the witne&s;&s;es &s;wore many trea&s;onable &s;peeches again&s;t him: He was be|lieved
<PB N="505" REF="520">
to have &s;poken oft with great indecency of the King, and with a &s;ort of threatning, that they would make him pa&s;s the bill of Exclu&s;ion. But a de&s;ign to &s;eize on the King was &s;o notorious a fal&s;hood, that notwith&s;tanding all that the witne&s;&s;es &s;wore the Grand Jury returned <HI>Ignoramus</HI> upon the bill. Upon this the Court cried out again&s;t the Ju|ries now returned, that they would not do the King ju&s;tice, tho' the matter of the bill was &s;worn by witne&s;&s;es who&s;e te&s;timony was well believed a few months before: It was commonly &s;aid, the&s;e Juries would believe every thing one way, and nothing the other. If they had found the bill, &s;o that <HI>Colledge</HI> had been tried upon it, he would have been certainly &s;aved: But &s;ince the witne&s;&s;es &s;wore that he went to <HI>Oxford</HI> on that de&s;ign, he was triable there. <HI>North</HI> went to <HI>Oxford, Colledge</HI> being carried thither: And he tried <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Colledge</HI> condemned, and died up|on it.</NOTE> him there. <HI>North</HI>'s behaviour in that whole matter was &s;uch, that probably, if he had lived to &s;ee an impeaching Parliament, he might have felt the ill effects of it. The witne&s;&s;es &s;wore &s;everal trea&s;onable words again&s;t <HI>Colledge,</HI> and that his coming to <HI>Oxford</HI> was in order to the executing the&s;e: So here was an over-act. <HI>Colledge</HI> was upon a negative: So he had nothing to &s;ay for him&s;elf, but to &s;hew how little credit was due to the witne&s;&s;es. He was condemned, and &s;uffered with great con&s;tancy, and with appearances of de|votion. He denied all the trea&s;onable matter that had been &s;worn again&s;t him, or that he knew of any plot again&s;t the King. He confe&s;&s;ed, that a great heat of temper had carried him to many undutiful expre&s;&s;ions of the King: But he pro|te&s;ted he was in no de&s;ign again&s;t him. And now the Court intended to &s;et the witne&s;&s;es to &s;wear again&s;t all the hot par|ty; which was plainly murder in them, who believed them fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es, and yet made u&s;e of them to de&s;troy others. One pa&s;&s;age happned at <HI>Colledge</HI>'s trial, which quite &s;unk <HI>Dugdale</HI>'s credit: It was objected to him by <HI>Colledge,</HI> to take away his credit, that, when by his lewdne&s;s he had got the <HI>French Pox,</HI> he to cover that gave it out that he was poy|&s;oned by Papi&s;ts: Upon which he, being then in Court, pro|te&s;ted &s;olemnly that he never had that di&s;ea&s;e; and &s;aid, that if it could be proved by any phy&s;ician that he ever had it, he was content that all the evidence he had ever given &s;hould be di&s;credited for ever. And he was taken at his word: For <HI>Lower,</HI> who was then the mo&s;t celebrated phy|&s;ician in <HI>London,</HI> proved at the Council board that he had been under cure in his hands for that di&s;ea&s;e; which was made
<PB N="506" REF="521">
out both by his bills, and by the Apothecaty that &s;erved them. So he was never more heard of.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> was committed next, and &s;ent to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Shaftsbury</HI> &s;ent to the Tower.</NOTE> the Tower upon the evidence of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> witne&s;&s;es. His papers were at the &s;ame time &s;eized on and &s;earched: No|thing material was found among them, but a draught of an a&s;&s;ociation, by which the King, if it had taken place, would have reigned only at the di&s;cretion of the party. This was neither writ, nor marked in any place with his hand: But, when there was a talk of an a&s;&s;ociation, &s;ome had formed this paper, and brought it to him; of which he always profe&s;&s;ed, after the matter was over, that he remembred nothing at all. So it is probable, that, as is ordinary when any great bu&s;ine&s;s is before the Parliament that zealous men are at the doors with their &s;everal draughts, this was one of the&s;e ca&s;t carele&s;&s;ly by, and not thought on by him when he had &s;ent his more valuable papers out of the way. There was likewi&s;e but one witne&s;s that could &s;wear to its being found there: And that was the Clerk of the Council, who had peru&s;ed tho&s;e papers without marking them in the pre|&s;ence of any witne&s;s, as taken among Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI>'s papers.</P>
<P>There was all this &s;ummer &s;trange practi&s;ing with wit|ne&s;&s;es to find more matter again&s;t him: <HI>Wilkin&s;on,</HI> a pri&s;o|ner <NOTE PLACE="marg">Practices up|on witne&s;&s;es.</NOTE> for debt that had been often with him, was dealt with to accu&s;e him. The Court had found out two &s;olicitors to manage &s;uch matters, <HI>Burton</HI> and <HI>Graham,</HI> who were indeed fitter men to have &s;erved in a court of inqui&s;ition than in a legal government. It was known, that Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> was apt to talk very freely, and without di&s;cretion: So the two &s;olicitors &s;ought out all that had frequented his com|pany; and tried what they could draw from them, not by a barefaced &s;ubornation, but by telling them, they knew well that Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> had talked &s;uch and &s;uch things, which they named, that were plainly trea&s;onable; and they required them to atte&s;t it, if they did ever hear &s;uch things from him: And they made them great promi&s;es upon their telling the truth. So that they gave hints and made promi&s;es to &s;uch as by &s;wearing boldly would de&s;erve them, and yet kept them&s;elves out of danger of &s;ubornation, hav|ing witne&s;&s;es in &s;ome corner of their chambers that over heard all their di&s;cour&s;e. This was their common practice, of which I had a particular account from &s;ome whom they examined with relation to my &s;elf. In all this foul deal|ing
<PB N="507" REF="522">
the King him&s;elf was believed to be the chief director: And Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> was thought deep in it, tho' he always expre&s;&s;ed an abhorrence of &s;uch practices to me.</P>
<P>His re&s;entments wrought &s;o violently on him, that he <NOTE PLACE="marg">I was then offered pre|ferment.</NOTE> &s;eemed to be gone off from all his former notions. He pre&s;|&s;ed me vehemently to accept of preferment at Court; and &s;aid, if I would give him leave to make promi&s;es in my name, he could obtain for me any preferment I plea&s;ed. But I would enter into no engagements. I was contented with the condition I was in, which was above nece&s;&s;ity, tho' be|low envy: The ma&s;ter&s;hip of the Temple was like to fall, and I liked that better than any thing el&s;e. So both Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> and Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> moved the King in it. He promi&s;ed I &s;hould have it. Upon which Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> car|ried me to the King. I had rea&s;on to believe, that he was highly di&s;plea&s;ed with me for what I had done a year be|fore. Mrs. <HI>Roberts,</HI> whom he had kept for &s;ome time, &s;ent for me when &s;he was a dying: I &s;aw her often for &s;ome weeks, and among other things I de&s;ired her to write a let|ter to the King, expre&s;&s;ing the &s;en&s;e &s;he had of her pa&s;t life: And at her de&s;ire I drew &s;uch a letter, as might be fit for her to write: But &s;he never had &s;trength enough to write it: So upon that I re&s;olved to write a very plain let|ter to the King: I &s;et before him his pa&s;t life, and the effects it had on the Nation, with the judgments of God that lay on him, which was but a &s;mall part of the puni&s;hment that he might look for: I pre&s;&s;ed him upon that earne&s;tly to change the whole cour&s;e of his life: I carried this let|ter to <HI>Chiffinch</HI>'s on the twenty ninth of <HI>January;</HI> and told the King in the letter, that I hoped the reflections on what had befallen his Father on the thirtieth of <HI>January</HI> might move him to con&s;ider the&s;e things more carefully. Lord <HI>Arran</HI> happned to be then in waiting: And he came to me next day, and told me, he was &s;ure the King had a long letter from me; for he held the candle to him while he read it: He knew at all that di&s;tance that it was my hand: The King read it twice over, and then threw it into the fire: And not long after Lord <HI>Arran</HI> took occa&s;ion to name me: And the King &s;poke of me with great &s;harpne&s;s: So he perceived that he was not plea&s;ed with my letter. Nor was the King plea&s;ed with my being &s;ent for by <HI>Wilmot</HI> Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> when he died: He fancied, that he had told me many things, of which I might make an ill u&s;e: Yet he had read the book that I writ concerning him, and &s;poke well of it.
<PB N="508" REF="523">
In this &s;tate I was in the King's thoughts, when Lord <HI>Ha|lifax</HI> carried me to him, and introduced me with a very ex|traordinary complement, that he did not bring me to the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Halifax</HI> car|ried me to the King.</NOTE> King to put me in his good opinion &s;o much as to put the King in my good opinion: And added, he hoped that the King would not only take me into his favour, but into his heart. The King had a peculiar faculty of &s;aying oblig|ing things with a very good grace: Among other things he &s;aid, he knew that, if I plea&s;ed, I could &s;erve him very con|&s;iderably; and that he de&s;ired no &s;ervice from me longer than he continued true to the Church and to the Law. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> upon that added, that the King knew he &s;erved him on the &s;ame terms, and was to make his &s;tops. The King and he fell into &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e about Religion. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> &s;aid to the King, that he was the head of his Church: To which the King an&s;wered, that he did not de&s;ire to be the head of nothing; for indeed he was of no Church. From that the King run out into much di&s;cour&s;e about Lord <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> who was &s;hortly to be tried: He complained with great &s;corn of the imputation of &s;ubornation that was ca&s;t on him&s;elf. He &s;aid, he did not wonder that the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> who was &s;o guilty of tho&s;e practices, &s;hould fa&s;|ten them on others. The di&s;cour&s;e la&s;ted half an hour very hearty and free: So I was in favour again. But I could not hold it. I was told I kept ill company: The per&s;ons Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> named to me were the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> and <HI>Jones.</HI> But I &s;aid, I would upon no con&s;ideration give over conver&s;ing with my friends: So I was where I was be|fore.</P>
<P>A bill of indictment was pre&s;ented to the Grand Jury again&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Shaftsbury</HI> was acquit|ted by the Grand Jury.</NOTE> Lord <HI>Shaftsbury.</HI> The Jury was compo&s;ed of many of the chief citizens of <HI>London.</HI> The witne&s;&s;es were examined in open Court, contrary to the u&s;ual cu&s;tom: The witne&s;&s;es &s;wore many incredible things again&s;t him, mixed with other things that looked very like his extravagant way of talking. The draught of the a&s;&s;ociation was al&s;o brought as a proof of his trea&s;on, tho' it was not laid in the indictment, and was proved only by one witne&s;s. The Jury returned <HI>Ignoramus</HI> upon the bill. Upon this the Court did declaim with open mouth again&s;t the&s;e Juries; in which they &s;aid the &s;pirit of the party did appear, &s;ince men even upon oath &s;hewed they were re&s;olved to find bills or <HI>Ignoramus,</HI> as they plea&s;ed, without regarding the evidence. And upon this a new &s;et of addre&s;&s;es went round the Kingdom, in which they expre&s;|&s;ed
<PB N="509" REF="524">
their abhorrence of that a&s;&s;ociation found in Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI>'s cabinet; and complained, that Ju&s;tice was denied the King; which were &s;et off with all the ful&s;om rhetorick that the penners could varni&s;h them with. It was upon this occa&s;ion &s;aid, that the Grand Jury ought to find bills even upon dubious evidence, much more when plain trea&s;on was &s;worn; &s;ince all they did in finding a bill was only to bring the per&s;on to his trial, and then the fal&s;hood of the witne&s;&s;es was to be detected. But in defence of the&s;e <HI>Igno|ramus</HI> Juries it was &s;aid, that by the expre&s;s words of their oath they were bound to make true pre&s;entments of what &s;hould appear true to them: And therefore, if they did not believe the evidence, they could not find a bill, tho' &s;worn to. A book was writ to &s;upport that, in which both law and rea&s;on were brought to confirm it: It pa&s;t as writ by Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> tho' I under&s;tood afterwards it was writ by <HI>Somers,</HI> who was much e&s;teemed and often vi&s;ited by Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and who tru&s;ted him&s;elf to him, and writ the be&s;t papers that came out in that time. It is true, by the practice that had generally prevailed, Grand Juries were ea&s;y in finding bills upon a &s;light and probable evidence. But it was made out, that the words of their oath, and the rea&s;on of the law &s;eemed to oblige them to make no pre&s;entments but &s;uch as they believed to be true. On the other hand a private ill opinion of a witne&s;s, or the looking on a matter as in|credible, did not &s;eem to warrant the return of an <HI>Ignora|mus:</HI> That &s;eemed to belong to the Jury of life and death. The chief complaint that was made in the addre&s;&s;es was grounded on their not finding the bill on the account of the draught of the a&s;&s;ociation: And this was in many re&s;pects very unrea&s;onable. For as that was not laid in the bill, &s;o there was but one witne&s;s to prove it; nor did the matter of the paper ri&s;e up to the charge of high trea&s;on. And now <HI>Dugdale</HI> and <HI>Turbervill,</HI> who had been the witne&s;&s;es up|on who&s;e evidence Lord <HI>Stafford</HI> was condemned, being with|in a year detected, or at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected of this villany, I could not but reflect on what he &s;aid to me, that he was confident I &s;hould &s;ee within a year that the witne&s;&s;es would be found to be rogues.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Turbervill,</HI> what happned &s;oon after this will per|haps <NOTE PLACE="marg">1682 $span$</NOTE> mitigate the cen&s;ure: He was taken with the &s;mall pox in a few days after Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI>'s trial. The &s;ymptoms were &s;o bad, that the phy&s;ician told him he had no hope of his recovery: Upon which he compo&s;ed him&s;elf to die as
<PB N="510" REF="525">
became a Chri&s;tian, and &s;ent for Mr. <HI>Hewes</HI> the Curate of St. <HI>Martins,</HI> who was a very worthy man, and from whom I had this account of him. <HI>Turbervill</HI> looked on him&s;elf as a dead man at the fir&s;t time he came to him: But his di&s;ea&s;e did no way affect his under&s;tanding or his memory. He &s;eemed to have a real &s;en&s;e of another &s;tate, and of the account that he was to give to God for his pa&s;t life. <HI>Hewes</HI> charged him to examin him&s;elf; and if he had &s;worn fal&s;ly again&s;t any man, to confe&s;s his &s;in and glorify God, tho' to his own &s;hame. <HI>Turbervill,</HI> both in di&s;cour&s;e and when he received the &s;acrament, prote&s;ted that he had &s;worn no|thing but the truth, in what he depo&s;ed both again&s;t Lord <HI>Stafford</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury;</HI> and renounced the mer|cies of God, and the benefit of the death of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> if he did not &s;peak the plain and naked truth without any re&s;erva|tion: And he continued in the &s;ame mind to his death. So here were the la&s;t words of dying men, again&s;t the la&s;t words of tho&s;e that &s;uffered. To this may well be added, that one who died of &s;ickne&s;s, and under a great depre&s;&s;ion in his &s;pi|rits, was le&s;s able to &s;tifle his con&s;cience, and re&s;i&s;t the im|pre&s;&s;ions that it might then make on him, than a man who &s;uffers on a &s;caffold, where the &s;trength of the natural &s;pi|rits is entire, or rather exalted by the &s;en&s;e of the cau&s;e he &s;uffers for. And we know that confe&s;&s;ion and ab&s;olution in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> give a quiet, to which we do not pre|tend, where the&s;e things are &s;aid to be only mini&s;terial, and not authoritative. About a year before this <HI>Tonge</HI> had died, who fir&s;t brought out <HI>Oates.</HI> They quarrelled afterwards: And <HI>Tonge</HI> came to have a very bad opinion of <HI>Oates,</HI> up|on what rea&s;on I know not. He died with expre&s;&s;ions of a very high devotion: And he prote&s;ted to all who came to &s;ee him, that he knew of no &s;ubornation in all that matter, and that he was guilty of none him&s;elf. The&s;e things put a man quite in the dark: And in this mi&s;t matters mu&s;t be left till the great revelation of all &s;ecrets. And there I leave it: And from the affairs of <HI>England</HI> turn to give an account of what pa&s;t in <HI>Scotland</HI> during this di&s;order among us here.</P>
<P>The Duke behaved him&s;elf upon his fir&s;t going to <HI>Scot|land</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The affairs of <HI>Scotland</HI></NOTE> in &s;o obliging a manner, that the Nobility and Gen|try, who had been &s;o long trodden on by Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> and his party, found a very &s;en&s;ible change: So that he gained much on them all. He continued &s;till to &s;upport that &s;ide: Yet things were &s;o gently carried, that there was
<PB N="511" REF="526">
no cau&s;e of complaint. It was vi&s;ibly his intere&s;t to make that Nation &s;ure to him, and to give them &s;uch an e&s;&s;ay of his government, as might di&s;&s;ipate all the hard thoughts of him with which the world was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: And he pur&s;ued this for &s;ome time with great temper and as great &s;ucce&s;s. He advi&s;ed the Bi&s;hops to proceed moderately, and to take no notice of Conventicles in hou&s;es; and that would put an end to tho&s;e in the fields. In matters of ju&s;tice he &s;hewed an impartial temper, and encouraged all propo&s;itions relat|ing to trade: And &s;o, con&s;idering how much that Nation was &s;et again&s;t his Religion, he made a greater progre&s;s in gain|ing upon them than was expected. He was advi&s;ed to hold a Parliament there in &s;ummer eighty one, and to take the character of the King's Commi&s;&s;ioner upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>A &s;trange &s;pirit of fury had broke loo&s;e on &s;ome of the Pre&s;byterians, called <HI>Cargillites</HI> from one <HI>Cargill</HI> that had been one of the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> in the former times, and was then very little con&s;idered, but now was much fol|lowed to the great reproach of the Nation. The&s;e held that the King had lo&s;t the right of the Crown by his break|ing the Covenant, which he had &s;worn at his Coronation: So they &s;aid, he was their King no more: And by a formal declaration they renounced all allegiance to him, which a party of them affixed to the cro&s;s of <HI>Dunfreis,</HI> a Town near the we&s;t border. The guards fell upon a party of them, whom they found in arms, where <HI>Cameron</HI> one of their fu|rious teachers (from whom they were al&s;o called <HI>Camero|nians)</HI> was killed: But <HI>Hack&s;ton,</HI> that was one of the Arch|bi&s;hop's murderers, and <HI>Cargill</HI> were taken. <HI>Hack&s;ton,</HI> when brought before the Council would not own their authority, nor make any an&s;wer to their que&s;tions. He was &s;o low by rea&s;on of his wounds, that it was thought he would die in the que&s;tion if tortured: So he was in a very &s;ummary way con|demned to have both his hands cut off, and then to be hanged. All this he &s;uffered with a con&s;tancy that amaz|ed all people: He &s;eemed to be all the while as in an en|thu&s;ia&s;tical rapture, and in&s;en&s;ible of what was done to him. When his hands were cut off, he a&s;ked, like one unconcern|ed, if his feet mu&s;t be cut off likewi&s;e: And he had &s;o &s;trong a heart, that notwith&s;tanding all the lo&s;s of blood by his wounds, and the cutting off his hands, yet when he was hanged up, and his heart cut out, it continued to palpitate &s;ome time after it was on the Hangman's knife, as &s;ome Eye-witne&s;&s;es a&s;&s;ured me. <HI>Cargill,</HI> and many others of that
<PB N="512" REF="527">
mad &s;ect, both men and women, &s;uffered with an ob&s;tinacy that was &s;o particular, that tho' the Duke &s;ent the offer of pardon to them on the Scaffold, if they would only &s;ay God ble&s;s the King, it was refu&s;ed with great neglect: One of them, a woman, &s;aid very calmly, &s;he was &s;ure God would not ble&s;s him, and that therefore &s;he would not take God's name in vain: Another &s;aid more &s;ullenly, that &s;he would not wor|&s;hip that idol, nor acknowledge any other King but <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> And &s;o both were hanged. About fifteen or &s;ixteen died under this delu&s;ion, which &s;eemed to be a &s;ort of madne&s;s: For they never attempted any thing again&s;t any per&s;on: Only they &s;eemed glad to &s;uffer for their opinions. The Duke &s;topt that pro&s;ecution, and appointed them to be put in a hou&s;e of correction, and to be kept at hard labour. Great u&s;e was made of this by prophane people to di&s;parage the &s;uffering of the Martyrs for the Chri&s;tian Faith, from the un&s;haken con&s;tancy which the&s;e frantick peopled expre&s;&s;ed. But this is undeniable, that men who die maintaining any opinion, &s;hew that they are firmly per&s;uaded of it: So from this the Martyrs of the fir&s;t age, who died for a&s;&s;erting a matter of fact, &s;uch as the re&s;urrection of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or the mira|cles that they had &s;een, &s;hewed that they were well per&s;uad|ed of the truth of tho&s;e facts. And that is all the u&s;e that is to be made of this argument.</P>
<P>Now the time of the &s;itting of the Parliament drew on. <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment in <HI>Scot|land.</HI></NOTE> The Duke &s;eeing how great a man the Earl of <HI>Argyle</HI> was in <HI>Scotland,</HI> concluded it was nece&s;&s;ary for him either to gain him or to ruin him. Lord <HI>Argyle</HI> gave him all po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;urances that he would adhere to his intere&s;t in every thing, except in the matters of Religion: But added, that if he went to meddle with the&s;e, he owned to him freely that he would oppo&s;e him all he could. This was well enough taken in &s;hew: But Lord <HI>Argyle</HI> &s;aid, he ob&s;erved ever after that &s;uch a vi&s;ible coldne&s;s and di&s;tru&s;t, that he &s;aw what he might expect from him. Some moved the excepting again&s;t the Duke's Commi&s;&s;ion to repre&s;ent the King in Parliament, &s;ince by law no man could execute any office without tak|ing the oaths: And above forty members of Parliament pro|mi&s;ed to &s;tick to Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> if he would in&s;i&s;t on that. But <HI>Lockhart</HI> and <HI>Cunningham,</HI> the two lawyers on who&s;e opinion they depended chiefly, &s;aid, that a commi&s;&s;ion to repre&s;ent the King's per&s;on fell not under the notion of an office: And &s;ince it was not expre&s;&s;ly named in the acts of Par|liament, they thought it did not fall within the general words
<PB N="513" REF="528">
of <HI>all places and offices of tru&s;t.</HI> So this was laid a&s;ide: And many who were offended at it complained of Duke <HI>Hamil|ton's</HI> cowardi&s;e. He &s;aid for him&s;elf, he had been in a &s;torm of &s;even years continuance by his oppo&s;ing Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> and that he would not engage in a new one with a &s;tronger party, unle&s;s he was &s;ure of the majority: And they were far from pretending to be able to bring matters to near an equality. The fir&s;t act that pa&s;t was one of three lines, confirming all the laws formerly made again&s;t Popery: The Duke thought it would give a good grace to all that &s;hould be done afterwards, to begin with &s;uch a general and cold confirmation of all former laws. Some moved, that a Committee might be appointed to examine all the former laws, (&s;ince &s;ome of them &s;eemed unrea&s;onably &s;evere, as pa&s;t in the fir&s;t heat of the Reformation,) that &s;o they might draw out of them all &s;uch as might be fit not only to be confirmed, but to be executed by better and pro|perer methods than tho&s;e pre&s;cribed in the former &s;tatutes, which had been all eluded. But it was not intended that this new confirmation &s;hould have any effect: And there|fore this motion was not hearkned to. But the act was hur|ried on, and pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The next act was for the unalterablene&s;s of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown. It was declared high trea&s;on ever to move for any alterations in it. Lord <HI>Argyle</HI> ran into this with zeal: So did Duke <HI>Hamilton:</HI> And all others that intended to merit by it made harangues about it. Lord <HI>Tweedale</HI> was the only man that ventured to move, that the act might be made as &s;trict as was po&s;&s;ible with relation to the Duke: But he thought it not nece&s;&s;ary to carry it further; &s;ince the Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;tood &s;o near the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and it was no amiable thing to be a Province to <HI>Spain.</HI> Many were &s;o ignorant as not to under&s;tand the relation of the Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> to the King, tho' &s;he was his niece, and thought it an extravagant motion. He was not &s;econded: And the act pa&s;t without one contradictory vote. There was an additio|nal revenue given for &s;ome years for keeping up more troops. Some complaints were al&s;o made of the Lords of regalities, who have all the forfeitures and the power of life and death within their regalities. It was upon that pro|mi&s;ed, that there &s;hould be a regulation of the&s;e Courts, as there was indeed great cau&s;e for it, the&s;e Lords being &s;o many tyrants up and down the country: So it was intended to &s;ubject the&s;e juri&s;dictions to the &s;upream Judicatories. But
<PB N="514" REF="529">
the act was penned in &s;uch words, as imported that the whole cour&s;e of ju&s;tice all over the Kingdom was made &s;ubject to the King's will and plea&s;ure: So that in&s;tead of appeals to the &s;upream Courts, all was made to end in a per&s;onal appeal to the King: And by this means he was made ma&s;ter of the whole ju&s;tice and property of the Kingdom. There was not much time given to con&s;ider things: For the Duke, find|ing that he was ma&s;ter of a clear majority, drove on every thing fa&s;t, and put bills on a very &s;hort debate to the vote, which went always as he had a mind to it. An accident hapned, that begot in many a particular zeal to merit at his hands: Lord <HI>Rothes,</HI> who had much of his confidence, and was chief|ly tru&s;ted by him, and was made a Duke by his means, died the day before the opening of the Parliament: So up|on the hopes of &s;ucceeding him, as there were many pre|tenders, they tried who could de&s;erve it be&s;t by the mo&s;t compliant &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and the mo&s;t active zeal.</P>
<P>As they were going on in publick bu&s;ine&s;s, one &s;tood up in Parliament and accu&s;ed Lord <HI>Halton,</HI> Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s <NOTE PLACE="marg">Several ac|cu&s;ations of perjury &s;ti|fled by the Duke.</NOTE> brother, of perjury, on the account of <HI>Mitchell</HI>'s bu&s;ine&s;s: He had in his hands the two letters that Lord <HI>Halton</HI> had writ to the Earl of <HI>Kincardin,</HI> mentioning the promi&s;e of life that was made him: And, as was told formerly, Lord <HI>Halton</HI> &s;wore at his trial that no promi&s;e was made. The Lord <HI>Kincardin</HI> was dead a year before this: But his Lady had delivered tho&s;e letters to be made u&s;e of again&s;t Lord <HI>Halton.</HI> Upon read|ing them the matter appeared plain. The Duke was not ill plea&s;ed to have both Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> and him thus at mercy: Yet he would not &s;uffer the matter to be determined in a parliamentary way: So he moved, that the whole thing might be referred to the King; which was immediately agreed to. So that infamous bu&s;ine&s;s was made publick, and yet &s;tifled at the &s;ame time: And no cen&s;ure was ever put on that ba&s;e action. Another di&s;covery was made of as wicked a con&s;piracy, tho' it had not &s;uch bad effects, becau&s;e the tools employed in it could not be wrought up to &s;uch a de|termined pitch of wickedne&s;s. The Lord <HI>Bargeny,</HI> who was nephew to Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> had been clapt up in pri&s;on, as concerned in the rebellion of <HI>Bothwell-Bridge.</HI> Several days were fixed on for his trial: But it was always put off. And at la&s;t he was let out without having any one thing ever ob|jected to him. When he was at liberty he u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible endeavours to find out on what grounds he had been committed. At la&s;t he di&s;covered a con&s;piracy, in which
<PB N="515" REF="530">
<HI>Halton</HI> and &s;ome others of that party were concerned: They had practi&s;ed on &s;ome, who had been in that rebel|lion, to &s;wear that he and &s;everal others were engaged in it, and that they had &s;ent them out to join in it. They promi&s;ed the&s;e witne&s;&s;es a large &s;hare of the confi&s;cated e&s;tates, if they went thro' in the bu&s;ine&s;s. Depo&s;itions were prepared for them: And they promi&s;ed to &s;wear them: Upon which a day was fixed for their trial. But the hearts of tho&s;e witne&s;&s;es failed them, or their con&s;ciences ro&s;e upon them: So that when the day came on, they could not bring them&s;elves to &s;wear again&s;t an innocent man; and plainly refu&s;ed to do it: Yet, upon new practices and new hopes, they again re&s;olved to &s;wear boldly: Upon which new days had been &s;et twice or thrice: And, their hearts turning again&s;t it, they were &s;till put off. Lord <HI>Bargeny</HI> had full proofs of all this ready to be offered: But the Duke prevailed to have this likewi&s;e re|ferred to the King: And it was never more heard of. This &s;hewed what Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s party were capable of. It likewi&s;e gave an ill character of the Duke's zeal for ju&s;tice, and again&s;t fal&s;e &s;wearing; tho' that had been the chief to|pick of di&s;cour&s;e with him for above three years. He was angry at a &s;uppo&s;ed practice with witne&s;&s;es, when it fell up|on his own party: But now that there were evident proofs of perjury and &s;ubornation, he &s;topt proceedings under pre|tence of referring it to the King; who was never made ac|quainted with it, or at lea&s;t never enquired after the proof of the&s;e allegations, nor ordered any proceedings upon them.</P>
<P>The main bu&s;ine&s;s of this Parliament was the act concern|ing <NOTE PLACE="marg">A te&s;t en|acted in Par|liament.</NOTE> the new te&s;t that was propo&s;ed. It had been promi&s;ed in the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, that as &s;oon as an act for maintaining the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hould pa&s;s they &s;hould have all the &s;ecurity that they could de&s;ire for the Prote&s;tant Reli|gion. So, many zealous men began to call for &s;ome more effectual &s;ecurity for their Religion: Upon which a te&s;t was propo&s;ed for all that &s;hould be capable of any office in Church or State, or of electing or being elected mem|bers of Parliament, that they &s;hould adhere firmly to the Pro|te&s;tant Religion; to which the Court party added, the con|demning of all re&s;i&s;tance in any &s;ort, or under any pre|tence, the renouncing the Covenant, and an obligation to defend all the King's rights and prerogatives, and that they &s;hould never meet to treat of any matter civil or eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal but by the King's permi&s;&s;ion, and never endeavour any
<PB N="516" REF="531">
alteration in the government in Church or State: And they were to &s;wear all this according to the literal &s;en&s;e of the words. The te&s;t was thus loaded at fir&s;t to make the other &s;ide grow weary of the motion and let it fall, which they would willingly have done. But the Duke was made to apprehend, that he would find &s;uch a te&s;t as this prove much for his &s;ervice: So it &s;eems, that article of the Pro|te&s;tant Religion was forgiven for the &s;ervice that was ex|pected from the other parts of the te&s;t. There was a hot debate upon the impo&s;ing it on all that might elect or be elected members of Parliament: It was &s;aid, that was the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential of all the privileges of the &s;ubjects, therefore they ought not to be limited in it. The Bi&s;hops were earne&s;t for this, which they thought would &s;ecure them for ever from a Pre&s;byterian Parliament. It was carried in the vote: And that made many of the Court more zealous than ever for carrying thro' the act. Some propo&s;ed that there &s;hould be two te&s;ts: One for Papi&s;ts with higher incapacities: And another for Pre&s;byterians with milder cen&s;ures. But that was rejected with much &s;corn, &s;ome making their Court by &s;ay|ing, they were more in danger from the Pre&s;byterians than from the Papi&s;ts: And it was reported that <HI>Pater&s;on,</HI> then Bi&s;hop of <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> &s;aid to the Duke, that he thought the two Religions, Popi&s;h and Prote&s;tant, were &s;o equally &s;tated in his mind, that a few grains of loyalty, in which the Pro|te&s;tants had the better of the Papi&s;ts, turned the balance with him. Another clau&s;e in the bill was liable to great objections: All the Royal Family were excepted out of it. Lord <HI>Argyle</HI> &s;poke zealou&s;ly again&s;t this: He &s;aid, the only danger we could apprehend as to Popery was, if any of the Royal Family &s;hould happen to be perverted: Therefore he thought it was better to have no act at all than &s;uch a clau&s;e in it. Some few &s;econded him: But it was carried without any con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition. The nice&s;t point of all was, what definition or &s;tandard &s;hould be made for fixing the &s;en&s;e of &s;o general a term, as the Prote&s;tant Religion. <HI>Dalrymple</HI> propo&s;ed the confe&s;&s;ion of faith agreed on in the year one thou&s;and five hundred fifty nine, and enacted in Parliament in one thou&s;and five hundred &s;ixty &s;even, which was the only confe&s;&s;ion of faith that had then the &s;anction of a law. That was a book &s;o worn out of u&s;e, that &s;carce any one in the whole Parliament had ever read it: None of the Bi&s;hops had, as appeared afterwards. For the&s;e la&s;t thirty years the only confe&s;&s;ion of faith that was read in <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
<PB N="517" REF="532">
was that which the a&s;&s;embly of divines at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Anno</HI> 1648 had &s;et out, which the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Kirk had &s;et up in&s;tead of the old one: And the Bi&s;hops had left it in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, tho' the authority that enacted it was annulled. So here a book was made the matter of an oath, (for they were to &s;wear that they would adhere to the Prote&s;tant Religion, as it was declared in the confe&s;&s;ion of faith enacted in the year 1567, that containeda large &s;y&s;tem of Religion, that was not &s;o much as known to tho&s;e who enacted it: Yet the Bi&s;hops went all into it. <HI>Dalrymple,</HI> who had read it, thought there were propo&s;itions in it, which being con&s;idered better of would make the te&s;t be let fall: For in it the repre&s;&s;ing of tyranny is reckoned a duty incumbent on good &s;ubjects. And the confe&s;&s;ion be|ing made after the <HI>Scots</HI> had depo&s;ed the Queen Regent, and it being ratified in Parliament after they had forced their Queen <HI>Mary</HI> to re&s;ign, it was very plain what they who made and enacted this confe&s;&s;ion meant by the repre&s;&s;ing of tyranny. But the Duke and his party &s;et it on &s;o earne&s;t|ly, that upon one day's debate the act pa&s;t, tho' only by a majority of &s;even voices. There was &s;ome appearance of &s;ecurity to the Prote&s;tant Religion by this te&s;t: But the pre|rogative of the Crown in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters had been rai&s;ed &s;o high by Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s act, that the obliging all people to maintain that with the re&s;t of the prerogative, might have made way for every thing. All eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts &s;ub&s;i&s;ted now by this te&s;t only upon the King's permi&s;&s;ion, and at his di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> was di&s;&s;olved &s;oon after this act pa&s;t: And <HI>Hyde</HI> was &s;ent down from the King to the Duke immediately upon it. It was given out, that he was &s;ent by the King to pre&s;s the Duke upon this victory to &s;hew, that what ill u&s;age could not extort from him he would now do of his own accord, and return to the Church of <HI>England.</HI> I was a&s;&s;ured, that Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> had prevailed with the King to write to him to that purpo&s;e: The letter was writ, but was not &s;ent: But Lord <HI>Hyde</HI> had it in charge to manage it as a me&s;&s;age. How much of this is true I cannot tell: One thing is certain, that if it was true it had no effect.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the te&s;t with the confe&s;&s;ion of faith was print|ed, there was a univer&s;al murmuring among the be&s;t of the Clergy. Many were again&s;t the &s;wearing to a &s;y&s;tem made up of &s;o many propo&s;itions, of which &s;ome were at lea&s;t
<PB N="518" REF="533">
doubtful; tho' it was found to be much more moderate in many points, than could have been well expected con&s;idering the heat of that time. There was a limitation put on the duty of &s;ubjects in the article, by which they were required not to re&s;i&s;t any whom God had placed in authority in the&s;e words, <HI>while they pa&s;s not the bounds of their office:</HI> And in another they condemned tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;t the &s;upream power <HI>doing that thing which appertaineth to his charge.</HI> The&s;e were propo&s;itions now of a very ill &s;ound: They were al&s;o high|ly <NOTE PLACE="marg">Objections made to the te&s;t.</NOTE> offended at the great extent of the prerogative in the point of &s;upremacy, by which the King turned Bi&s;hops out at plea&s;ure by a letter. It was hard enough to bear this: But it &s;eemed intolerable to oblige men by oath to maintain it. The King might by a Proclamation put down even Epi&s;copacy it &s;elf, as the law then &s;tood: And by this oath they would be bound to maintain that. All meeting in Sy|nods, or for Ordinations, were hereafter to be held only by permi&s;&s;ion: So that all the vi&s;ible ways of pre&s;erving Reli|gion depended now wholly on the King's good plea&s;ure: And they &s;aw that this would be a very feeble tenure un|der a Popi&s;h King. The being tied to all this by oath &s;eem|ed very hard. And when a Church was yet in &s;o imperfect a &s;tate without liturgy or di&s;cipline, it was a &s;trange impo|&s;ition to make people &s;wear never to endeavour any altera|tion either in Church or State. Some or all of the&s;e excep|tions did run &s;o generally thro' the whole body of the Clergy, that they were all &s;haking in their re&s;olutions. To prevent this, an explanation was drawn by Bi&s;hop <HI>Pater&s;on,</HI> and pa&s;t in Council. It was by it declared, that it was not meant that tho&s;e who took the te&s;t &s;hould be bound to every article in the confe&s;&s;ion of faith, but only in &s;o far as it contained the doctrine upon which the Prote&s;tant Churches had &s;ettled the reformation: And that the te&s;t did not cut off tho&s;e rights, which were acknowledged to have been in the primitive Church for the fir&s;t three hundred years after <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> And an a&s;&s;urance was given, that the King intended never to change the government of the Church. By this it was pretended that the greate&s;t difficulties were now re|moved. But to this it was an&s;wered, that they were to &s;wear they took the oath in the literal &s;en&s;e of the words. So that, if this explanation was not conform to the literal &s;en&s;e, they would be perjured who took it upon this explanation. The impo&s;ers of an oath could only declare the &s;en&s;e of it: But that could not be done by any other, much le&s;s by a lower
<PB N="519" REF="534">
authority, &s;uch as the privy Councils was confe&s;&s;ed to be. Yet when men are to be undone if they do not &s;ubmit to a hard law, they willingly catch at any thing that &s;eems to re&s;olve their doubts.</P>
<P>About eighty of the mo&s;t learned and pious of their Clergy <NOTE PLACE="marg">Many turn|ed out for $span$</NOTE> left all rather than comply with the terms of this law: And the&s;e were noted to be the be&s;t preachers, and the mo&s;t zealous enemies to Popery, that belonged to that Church. The Bi&s;hops, who thought their refu&s;ing the te&s;t was a re|proach to tho&s;e who took it, treated them with much con|tempt, and put them to many hard&s;hips. About twenty of them came up to <HI>England:</HI> I found them men of excellent tempers, pious and learned, and I e&s;teemed it no &s;mall hap|pine&s;s that I had then &s;o much credit by the ill opinion they had of me at Court, that by this means I got mo&s;t of them to be well &s;ettled in <HI>England;</HI> where they have behaved them&s;elves &s;o worthily, that I have great rea&s;on to rejoice in being made an in&s;trument to get &s;o many good men, who &s;uffered for their con&s;ciences, to be again well employ|ed, and well provided for. Mo&s;t of them were formed by <HI>Charteris,</HI> who had been always a great enemy to the impo|&s;ing of books and &s;y&s;tems as te&s;ts that mu&s;t be &s;igned and &s;worn by &s;uch as are admitted to &s;erve in the Church. He had been for &s;ome years Divinity Profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> where he had formed the minds of many of the young Clergy both to an excellent temper and to a &s;et of very good prin|ciples. He upon this retired, and lived private for &s;ome years: He writ to me, and gave me an account of this breach, that was like to be in the Church; and de&s;ired, that I would try by all the methods I could think of to &s;top the pro|ceedings upon the te&s;t. But the King had put the affairs of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;o entirely in the Duke's hands, and the Bi&s;hops here were &s;o plea&s;ed with tho&s;e clau&s;es in the te&s;t that re|nounced the covenant and all endeavours for any alteration in Church and State, that I &s;aw it was in vain to make any attempt at Court.</P>
<P>Upon this matter an incident of great importance hap|ned: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Argile</HI>'s ex|planation.</NOTE> The Earl of <HI>Argile</HI> was a privy Coun&s;ellor, and one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury: So when the time limit|ed was near lap&s;ing he was forced to declare him&s;elf. He had once re&s;olved to retire from all employments, but his en|gagements with Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s party, and the entangle|ments of his own affairs overcame that. His main objection lay to that part which obliged them to endeavour no altera|tion
<PB N="520" REF="535">
in the Government in Church or State, which he thought was a limitation of the Legi&s;lature. He de&s;ired leave to ex|plain him&s;elf in that point: And he continued always to affirm, that the Duke was &s;atisfied with that which he pro|po&s;ed: So being called on the next day at the Council table to take the te&s;t, he &s;aid, he did not think that the Parlia|ment did intend an oath that &s;hould have any contra|dictions in one part of it to another; therefore he took the te&s;t, as it was con&s;i&s;tent with it &s;elf: (This related to the ab&s;olute loyalty in the te&s;t, and the limitations that were on it in the confe&s;&s;ion:) And he added, that he did not intend to bind him&s;elf up by it from doing any thing in his &s;ta|tion for the amending of any thing in Church or State, &s;o far as was con&s;i&s;tent with the Prote&s;tant Religion and the duty of a good &s;ubject: And he took that as a part of his oath. The thing pa&s;t, and he &s;at that day in Council; and went next day to the Trea&s;ury chamber, where he repeated the &s;ame words. Some officious people upon this came, and &s;ugge&s;ted to the Duke, that great advantage might be taken again&s;t him from the&s;e words. So at the Trea&s;ury chamber he was de&s;ired to write them down, and give them to the Clerk, which he did, and was immediately made a pri&s;oner in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edenburgh</HI> upon it. It was &s;aid, this was <NOTE PLACE="marg">He was committed upon it.</NOTE> high trea&s;on, and the a&s;&s;uming to him&s;elf the legi&s;lative power, in his giving a &s;en&s;e of an act of Parliament, and making that a part of his oath. It was al&s;o &s;aid, that his &s;aying that he did not think the Parliament intended an oath that did contradict it &s;elf, was a tacit way of &s;aying that he did think it, and was a defaming and a &s;pread|ing lies of the proceedings of Parliament, which was capi|tal. The liberty that he re&s;erved to him&s;elf was likewi&s;e called trea&s;onable, in a&s;&s;uming a power to act again&s;t law: The&s;e were &s;uch apparent &s;tretches, that for &s;ome days it was believed all this was done only to affright him to a more ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and to &s;urrender up &s;ome of tho&s;e great juri&s;dictions over the <HI>Highlands</HI> that were in his fami|ly. He de&s;ired he might be admitted to &s;peak with the Duke in private: But that was refu&s;ed. He had let his old corre&s;pondence with me fall for &s;ome years: But I thought it became me in this extremity to &s;erve him all I could. And I prevailed with Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> to &s;peak &s;o oft to the King about it, that it came to be known: And Lord <HI>Argile</HI> writ me &s;ome letters of thanks upon it. Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> was &s;till in a firm friend&s;hip with him, and tried his whole &s;trength
<PB N="521" REF="536">
with the King to pre&s;erve him: But he was &s;inking both in body and mind, and was like to be ca&s;t off in his old age. Upon which I al&s;o prevailed with Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> to offer him his &s;ervice, for which Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> &s;ent me very kind me&s;&s;ages. I thought the&s;e were the only returns that I ought to make him for all the injuries he had done me, thus to &s;erve him and his friends in di&s;tre&s;s. But the Duke of <HI>York</HI> took this, as he did every thing from me, by the wor&s;t handle po&s;&s;ible. He &s;aid, I would reconcile my &s;elf to the greate&s;t enemies I had in oppo&s;ition to him. Upon this it was not thought fit upon many accounts that I &s;hould go and &s;ee Duke <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> which I had intended to do. It was well known I had done him acts of friend&s;hip: So the &s;candal of being in enmity with him was over: For a Chri&s;ti|an is no man's enemy: And he will always &s;tudy to over|come evil with good.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Argile</HI> was brought to a trial for the words he had <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Argile</HI> is tri|ed and con|demned.</NOTE> &s;poke. The Fact was certain: So the debate lay in a point of law, what guilt could be made out of his words. <HI>Lock|hart</HI> pleaded three hours for him, and &s;hewed &s;o manife&s;tly that his words had no &s;ort of criminou&s;ne&s;s, much le&s;s of trea&s;on in them, that, if his cau&s;e had not been judged be|fore his trial, no harm could have come to him. The Court that was to judge the point of law (or the relevancy of the libel as it's called in <HI>Scotland)</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of a Ju&s;tice Ge|neral, the Ju&s;tice Clerk, and of five Judges. The Ju&s;tice General does not vote, unle&s;s the Court is equally divided. One of the Judges was deaf, and &s;o old that he could not &s;it all the while the trial la&s;ted, but went home and to bed. The other four were equally divided: So the old Judge was &s;ent for: And he turned it again&s;t Lord <HI>Argile.</HI> The Jury was only to find the fact proved: But yet they were officious, and found it trea&s;on: And, to make a &s;hew of im|partiality, whereas in the libel he was charged with perjury for taking the oath fal&s;ly, they acquitted him of the per|jury. No &s;entence in our age was more univer&s;ally cried out on than this. All people &s;poke of it, and of the Duke who drove it on, with horror: All that was &s;aid to le&s;&s;en that was, that Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> had re&s;tored the family with &s;uch an extended juri&s;diction that he was really the ma&s;ter of all the <HI>Highlands:</HI> So that it was fit to attaint him, that by a new re&s;toring him the&s;e grants might be better limit|ed. This, as the Duke wrote to the King, was all he in|tended by it, as Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> a&s;&s;ured me. But Lord <HI>Argile</HI>
<PB N="522" REF="537">
was made believe, that the Duke intended to proceed to ex|ecution. Some more of the guards were ordered to come to <HI>Edenburgh.</HI> Rooms were al&s;o fitted for him in the common jayl, to which Peers u&s;e to be removed a few days before their execution. And a per&s;on of Quality, whom Lord <HI>Argile</HI> never named, affirmed to him on his honour, that he heard one who was in great favour &s;ay to the Duke, The thing mu&s;t be done, and that it would be ea&s;ier to &s;atisfy the King about it after it was done, than to obtain his leave for doing it. It is certain, many of the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Nobility did believe that it was intended he &s;hould die.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e rea&s;ons Lord <HI>Argile</HI> made his e&s;cape out of <NOTE PLACE="marg">He made his e&s;cape.</NOTE> the Ca&s;tle in a di&s;gui&s;e. Others &s;u&s;pected tho&s;e &s;tories were &s;ent to him on purpo&s;e to frighten him to make his e&s;cape; as that which would ju&s;tify further &s;everities again&s;t him. He came to <HI>London,</HI> and lurked for &s;ome months there. It was thought I was in his &s;ecret. But tho' I knew one that knew it, and &s;aw many papers that he then writ, giv|ing an account of all that matter, yet I abhorred lying: And it was not ea&s;y to have kept out of the danger of that, if I had &s;een him, or known where he was: So I avoided it by not &s;eeing him. One that &s;aw him knew him, and went and told the King of it: But he would have no &s;earch made for him, and retained &s;till very good thoughts of him. In one of Lord <HI>Argile</HI>'s papers he writ, that, if ever he was ad|mitted to &s;peak with the King, he could convince him how much he merited at his hands by that which had drawn the Duke's indignation on him. He that &s;hewed me this explained it, that at the Duke's fir&s;t being in <HI>Scotland,</HI> when he appre|hended that the King might have con&s;ented to the Exclu&s;ion, he tried to engage Lord <HI>Argile</HI> to &s;tick to him in that ca&s;e; who told him, he would always be true to the King, and likewi&s;e to him when it &s;hould come to his turn to be King, but that he would go no farther, nor engage him|&s;elf in ca&s;e the King and he &s;hould quarrel.</P>
<P>I had lived many years in great friend&s;hip with the Earl of <HI>Perth:</HI> I lived with him as a father with a &s;on for above twelve years: And he had really the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions of a child to me. So, he having been on Lord <HI>Argile's</HI> Jury, I writ him a letter about it with the freedom that I thought became me: He, to merit at the Duke's hands, &s;hewed it to him, as he him&s;elf confe&s;&s;ed to me. I could very ea&s;ily forgive him, but could not e&s;teem him much after &s;o unworthy an action. He was then a&s;piring to great preferment, and &s;o
<PB N="523" REF="538">
&s;acrificed me to obtain favour: But he made greater &s;acri|fices afterwards. The Duke now &s;eemed to triumph in <HI>Scot|land.</HI> All &s;tooped to him. The Pre&s;byterian party was much depre&s;&s;ed. The be&s;t of the Clergy were turned out. Yet, with all this, he was now more hated there than ever. Lord <HI>Argile</HI>'s bu&s;ine&s;s made him be looked on as one that would prove a terrible ma&s;ter when all &s;hould come into his hands. He had promi&s;ed to redre&s;s all the merchant's grievances with relation to trade, that &s;o he might gain their concurrence in Parliament: But, as &s;oon as that was over, all his promi&s;es were forgotten. The accu&s;ations of perjury were &s;tifled by him. And all the complaints of the great abu&s;e Lord <HI>Halton</HI> was guilty of in the matter of the coin ended in turning him out of all his em|ployments, and obliging him to compound for his pardon by paying 20000 <HI>l.</HI> to two of the Duke's creatures: So that all the reparation the Kingdom had for the oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;o many years, and &s;o many acts of inju&s;tice, was, that two new oppre&s;&s;ors had a &s;hare of the &s;poils, who went into the &s;ame tract, or rather invented new methods of oppre&s;&s;ion. All the&s;e things, together with a load of age and of a va&s;t bulk, &s;unk Duke <HI>Lauderdale</HI> &s;o that he died that &s;ummer. His heart &s;eemed quite &s;pent: There was not left above the bigne&s;s of a walnut of firm &s;ub&s;tance: The re&s;t was &s;pungy, liker the lungs than the heart.</P>
<P>The Duke had leave given him to come to the King at <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke comes to Court.</NOTE> <HI>New-Market:</HI> And there he prevailed for leave to come up, and live again at Court. As he was going back to bring the Duche&s;s, the <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> frigat that carried him &s;truck on a bank of &s;and. The Duke got into a boat: And took care of his dogs, and &s;ome unknown per&s;ons who were taken from that earne&s;t care of his to be his Prie&s;ts: The long-boat went off with very few in her, tho' &s;he might have carried off above eighty more than &s;he did. One hundred and fifty per&s;ons peri&s;hed: Some of them men of great Quality. But the Duke took no notice of this cruel neglect, which was laid chiefly to <HI>Leg</HI>'s charge.</P>
<P>In <HI>Scotland</HI> the Duke declared the new mini&s;ters: <HI>Gordon,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new mini|&s;try in <HI>Scot|land.</HI></NOTE> now Earl of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> was made Chancellor: And <HI>Queensbury</HI> was made Trea&s;urer: And the care of all affairs was commit|ted to them. The Duke at parting recommended to the Council to pre&s;erve the publick peace, to &s;upport the Church, and to oblige all men to live regularly in obedience to the laws. The Bi&s;hops made their court to him with &s;o much zeal, that they wrote a letter to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canter|bury,</HI>
<PB N="524" REF="539">
to be communicated to the re&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hops, &s;etting forth in a very high &s;train his affection to the Church, and his care of it: And, lea&s;t this piece of merit &s;hould have been &s;tifled by <HI>Sancroft,</HI> they &s;ent a copy of it to the pre&s;s; which was a greater reproach to them than a &s;ervice to the Duke, who could not but de&s;pi&s;e &s;uch abject and indecent flattery. The proceedings again&s;t Conventicles were now like to be &s;everer than ever: All the fines, that were &s;et &s;o high by law that they were never before levied but on &s;ome particular in&s;tances, were now ordered to be levied without exception. All people upon that &s;aw, they mu&s;t either con|form or be quite undone. The Chancellor laid down a me|thod for proceeding again&s;t all offenders punctually: And the Trea&s;urer was as rigorous in ordering all the fines to be levied.</P>
<P>When the people &s;aw this, they came all to Church again: <NOTE PLACE="marg">They pro|ceeded with great &s;eve|rity.</NOTE> And that in &s;ome places where all &s;ermons had been di&s;|continued for many years. But they came in &s;o aukward a manner, that it was vi&s;ible they did not mean to wor&s;hip God, but only to &s;tay &s;ome time within the Church walls: And they were either talking or &s;leeping all the while. Yet mo&s;t of the Clergy &s;eemed to be tran&s;ported with this change of their condition, and &s;ent up many panegyricks of the glo|rious &s;ervices that the Duke had done their Church. The enemies of Religion ob&s;erved the ill nature of the one &s;ide, and the cowardline&s;s of the other, and plea&s;ed them&s;elves in cen&s;uring them both. And by this means an impious and athei&s;tical leaven began to corrupt mo&s;t of the younger &s;ort. This has &s;ince that time made a great progre&s;s in that Kingdom, which was before the free&s;t from it of any Na|tion in Chri&s;tendom. The beginnings of it were reckon|ed from the Duke's &s;tay among them, and from his Court, which have been cultivated &s;ince with much care and but too much &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>About the end of the year two trials gave all people &s;ad apprehen&s;ions of what they were to look for. One <HI>Home</HI> was charged by a kin&s;man of his own for having been at <HI>Bothwell-Bridge.</HI> All Gentlemen of e&s;tates were excepted out of the indemnity: So he having an e&s;tate could have no benefit by that. One &s;wore, he &s;aw him go into a village, and &s;eize on &s;ome arms: Another &s;wore, he &s;aw him ride towards the body of the rebels: But none did &s;wear that they &s;aw him there. He was indeed among them: But there was no proof of it. And he proved, that he was not in the
<PB N="525" REF="540">
company where the &s;ingle witne&s;s &s;wore he &s;aw him &s;eize on arms, and did evidently di&s;credit him: Yet he was con|victed and condemned on that &s;ingle evidence, that was &s;o manife&s;tly proved to be infamous. Many were &s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;chievou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch a precedent: And great appli|cations were made to the Duke for &s;aving his life: But he was not born under a pardoning planet. Lord <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> the Chancellor, pro&s;ecuted <HI>Home</HI> with the more rigour, becau&s;e his own grandfather had &s;uffered in the late times for bear|ing arms on the King's &s;ide, and <HI>Home</HI>'s father was one of the Jury that ca&s;t him. The day of his execution was &s;et to be on the &s;ame day of the year on which Lord <HI>Stafford</HI> had &s;uffered; which was thought done in complement to the Duke, as a retaliation for his blood. Yet <HI>Home</HI>'s infa|mous kin&s;man, who had &s;o ba&s;ely &s;worn again&s;t him, lived not to &s;ee his execution; for he died before it full of hor|ror for what he had done. Another trial went much deeper; and the con&s;equences of it &s;truck a terror into the whole country.</P>
<P>One <HI>Weir</HI> of <HI>Blakewood,</HI> that managed the Marquis of <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI>'s concerns, was accu&s;ed of trea&s;on for having kept company with one that had been in the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Bothwell-Bridge. Blake|wood</HI> pleaded for him&s;elf, that the per&s;on, on who&s;e account he was now pro&s;ecuted as an abettor of traitors, had never been marked out by the government by proce&s;s or procla|mation. It did not &s;o much as appear that he had ever &s;u&s;pected him upon that account. He had lived in his own hou&s;e quietly for &s;ome years after that rebellion before he employed him: And if the government &s;eemed to forget his crime, it was no wonder if others entred into common deal|ings with him. All the lawyers were of opinion, that no|thing could be made of this pro&s;ecution: So that <HI>Blakewood</HI> made u&s;e of no &s;ecret application, thinking he was in no danger. But the Court came to a &s;trange &s;entence in this matter, by the&s;e &s;teps: They judged, that all men who &s;u&s;pected any to have been in the rebellion were bound to di&s;cover &s;uch their &s;u&s;picion, and to give no harbour to &s;uch per&s;ons: That the bare &s;u&s;picion made it trea&s;on to harbour the per&s;on &s;u&s;pected, whether he was quilty or not: That if any per&s;on was under &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion, it was to be pre&s;umed that all the neighbourhood knew it: So that there was no need of proving that again&s;t any particular per&s;on, &s;ince the pre|&s;umption of law did prove it: And it being proved that the
<PB N="526" REF="541">
per&s;on with whom <HI>Blakewood</HI> had conver&s;ed lay under that &s;u&s;pi|cion, <HI>Blakewood</HI> was upon that condemned as guilty of high trea|&s;on. This was &s;uch a con&s;tructive trea&s;on, that went upon &s;o many unrea&s;onable &s;uppo&s;itions, that it &s;hewed the &s;hame|le&s;&s;ne&s;s of a &s;ort of men who had been for forty years de|claiming again&s;t a parliamentary attainder for a con&s;tructive trea&s;on in the ca&s;e of the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and did now in a common Court of Ju&s;tice condemn a man upon a train of &s;o many inferences that it was not po&s;&s;ible to make it look even like a con&s;tructive trea&s;on. The day of his execution was &s;et: And tho' the Marquis of <HI>Douglas</HI> writ earne&s;tly to the Duke for his pardon, that was denied. He only obtained two months reprieve for making up his accounts. The re|prieve was renewed once or twice: So <HI>Blakewood</HI> was not executed. This put all the Gentry in a great fright: Many knew they were as obnoxious as <HI>Blakewood</HI> was: And none could have the comfort to know that he was &s;afe. This revived among them a de&s;ign, that <HI>Lockhart</HI> had &s;et on foot ten years before, of carrying over a Plantation to <HI>Carolina.</HI> All the Pre&s;byterian party &s;aw they were now di&s;inhe|rited of a main part of their birth-right, of choo&s;ing their repre&s;entatives in Parliament: And upon that they &s;aid, they would now &s;eek a country were they might live undi&s;turbed, as freemen, and as Chri&s;tians. The Duke en|couraged the motion: He was glad to have many untoward people &s;ent far away, who he reckoned would be ready up|on the fir&s;t favourable conjuncture to break out into a new rebellion. Some Gentlemen were &s;ent up to treat with the Patentees of <HI>Carolina:</HI> They did not like the government of tho&s;e <HI>Palatinates,</HI> as they were called: Yet the pro&s;pect of &s;o great a Colony obtained to them all the conditions they propo&s;ed. I was made acquainted with all the &s;teps they made; for tho&s;e who were &s;ent up were particularly recommended to me. In the negotiation this year there was no mixing with the male-contents in <HI>England:</HI> Only they who were &s;ent up went among them, and informed them of the oppre&s;&s;i|ons they lay under; in particular of the terror with which this &s;entence again&s;t <HI>Blakewood</HI> had &s;truck them all. The Court re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute that farther: For a Proclamation was i&s;&s;ued out in the beginning of the year eighty three, by which the King ordered circuit Courts to be &s;ent round the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> and <HI>Southern</HI> Counties, to enquire after all who had been guilty of harbouring or conver&s;ing with tho&s;e who had been in rebellion, even tho' there had been neither proce&s;s nor
<PB N="527" REF="542">
proclamation i&s;&s;ued out again&s;t them. He al&s;o ordered, that all who were found guilty of &s;uch conver&s;e with them &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted as traitors. This inqui&s;ition was to la&s;t three years: And at the end of that time all was to conclude in a full indemnity to &s;uch as &s;hould not be then under pro|&s;ecution. But the indemnity was to take place immediately to all &s;uch as &s;hould take the Te&s;t. This was perhaps &s;uch a Proclamation as the world had not &s;een &s;ince the days of the Duke of <HI>Alva.</HI> Upon it great numbers run in to take the Te&s;t, declaring at the &s;ame time that they took it again&s;t their con&s;ciences: But they would do any thing to be &s;afe. Such as re&s;olved not to take it were trying how to &s;ettle or &s;ell their e&s;tates; and re&s;olved to leave the coun|try, which was now in a very oppre&s;&s;ed and de&s;perate &s;tate.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t next turn again to the affairs of <HI>England.</HI> The <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> Court was every where triumphant. The Duke was highly complemented by all, and &s;eemed to have overcome all dif|ficulties. The Court, not content with all their victories, re&s;olved to free them&s;elves from the fears of trouble&s;ome Par|liaments for the future. The Cities and Boroughs of <HI>Eng|land</HI> were invited, and prevailed on, to demon&s;trate their loyalty, by &s;urrendring up their Charters, and taking new <NOTE PLACE="marg">All Charters of Towns were &s;urren|dred to the King.</NOTE> ones modelled as the Court thought fit. It was much que&s;|tioned, whether tho&s;e &s;urrenders were good in law or not: It was &s;aid, that tho&s;e who were in the government in Cor|porations, and had their Charters and Seals tru&s;ted to their keeping, were not the proprietors nor ma&s;ters of tho&s;e rights: They could not extingui&s;h tho&s;e Corporations, nor part with any of their privileges. Others &s;aid, that what|ever might be objected to the rea&s;on and equity of the thing, yet, when the Seal of a Corporation was put to any deed, &s;uch a deed was good in law. The matter goes beyond my &s;kill in law to determine it: This is certain, that what&s;o|ever may be &s;aid in law, there is no &s;ort of theft or perfidy more criminal than for a body of men, whom their neigh|bours have tru&s;ted with their concerns, to &s;teal away their Charters, and affix their Seals to &s;uch a deed, betraying in that their tru&s;t and their oaths. In former ages Corporati|ons were jealous of their privileges and cu&s;toms to exce&s;s and &s;uper&s;tition: So that it looked like a &s;trange degeneracy, when all the&s;e were now delivered up; and this on de&s;ign to pack a Parliament that might make way for a Popi&s;h King. So that, in&s;tead of &s;ecuring us from Popery under
<PB N="528" REF="543">
&s;uch a Prince, the&s;e per&s;ons were now contriving ways to make all ea&s;y to him. Popery at all times has looked odious and cruel: Yet what the Emperor had lately done in <HI>Hun|gary,</HI> and what the King of <HI>France&punc;</HI> was then doing again&s;t Prote&s;tants in that Kingdom, &s;hewed that their Religion was as perfidious and as cruel in this age as it had been in the la&s;t: And by the Duke's government of <HI>Scotland</HI> all men did &s;ee what was to be expected from him. All this laid toge|ther, the whole looked like an extravagant fit of madne&s;s: Yet no part of it was &s;o unaccountable, as the high &s;trains to which the Univer&s;ities and mo&s;t of the Clergy were car|ried. The Non-conformi&s;ts were now pro&s;ecuted with much eagerne&s;s. This was vi&s;ibly &s;et on by the Papi&s;ts: And it was wi&s;ely done of them; for they knew how much the Non|conformi&s;ts were &s;et again&s;t them; and therefore they made u&s;e of the indi&s;creet heat of &s;ome angry Clergymen to ruin them: This they knew would render the Clergy odious, and give the Papi&s;ts great advantages again&s;t them, if ever they &s;hould &s;trike up into an oppo&s;ition to their de&s;igns.</P>
<P>At Mid&s;ummer a new conte&s;t di&s;covered how little the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The di&s;pute concerning the Sheriffs of <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> Court re&s;olved to regard either ju&s;tice or decency. The Court had carried the election of Sir <HI>John Moor</HI> to be Mayor of the city of <HI>London</HI> at Michaelmas eighty one. He was the Alderman on whom the election fell in cour&s;e. Yet &s;ome who knew him well were for &s;etting him a&s;ide, as one whom the Court would ea&s;ily manage. He had been a Non-con|formi&s;t him&s;elf, till he grew &s;o rich that he had a mind to go thro' the dignities of the City: But tho' he conform|ed to the Church, yet he was &s;till looked on as one that in his heart favoured the Sectaries: And upon this occa&s;i|on he per&s;uaded &s;ome of their preachers to go among their congregations to get votes for him. Others, who knew him to be a flexible and faint-hearted man, oppo&s;ed his election: Yet it was carried for him. The oppo&s;ition that was made to his election had &s;harpned him &s;o much, that he became in all things compliant to the Court, in particular to Secre|tary <HI>Jenkins,</HI> who took him into his own management. When the day came in which the Mayor u&s;ed to drink to one, and to mark him out for Sheriff, he drank to <HI>North,</HI> a merchant that was brother to the Chief Ju&s;tice. Upon that it was pretended, that this ceremony was not a bare nomination, which the common Hall might receive or re|fu&s;e as they had a mind, to it; but that this made the She|riff, and that the common Hall was bound to receive and
<PB N="529" REF="544">
confirm him in cour&s;e, as the King did the Mayor. On the other hand it was &s;aid, that the right was to be determined by the Charter, which granted the election of the Sheriffs to the citizens of <HI>London;</HI> and that, whatever cu&s;toms had crept in among them, the right &s;till lay where the Charter had lodged it among the citizens. But the Court was re|&s;olved to carry this point: And they found orders that had been made in the City concerning this particular, which gave &s;ome colour to this preten&s;ion of the Mayor's. So he claim|ed it on Mid&s;ummer day; and &s;aid, the common Hall were to go and elect one Sheriff, and to confirm the other that had been declared by him. The Hall on the other hand &s;aid, that the right of choo&s;ing both was in them. The old Sheriffs put it according to cu&s;tom to a poll: And it was vi&s;ible, the much greater number was again&s;t the Lord Mayor. The Sheriffs were always under&s;tood to be the offi|cers of that Court: So the adjourning it belonged to them: Yet the Mayor adjourned the Court; which they &s;aid he had no power to do, and &s;o went on with the poll. There was no di&s;order in the whole progre&s;s of the matter, if that was not to be called one, that they proceeded after the Mayor had adjourned the poll. But tho' the Mayor's party carried them&s;elves with great in&s;olence towards the other party, yet they &s;hewed on this occa&s;ion more temper than could have been expected from &s;o great a body, who thought their rights were now invaded. The Mayor upon this re&s;olved to take another poll, to which none &s;hould be admitted but tho&s;e who were contented to vote only for one, and to approve his nomination for the other. And it was re&s;olved, that his poll &s;hould be that by which the bu|&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be &s;ettled: And tho' the Sheriffs poll exceeded his by many hundreds, yet order was given to return tho&s;e on the Mayor's poll, and that they &s;hould be &s;worn; and &s;o tho&s;e of the Sheriffs poll &s;hould be left to &s;eek their remedy by law, where they could find it. <HI>Box,</HI> who was cho&s;en by the Mayor's party and joined to <HI>North,</HI> had no mind to &s;erve upon &s;o doubtful an election, where &s;o many actions would lie if it was judged again&s;t them at law: And he could not be per&s;uaded to hold it. So it was nece&s;&s;ary to call a new common Hall, and to proceed to a new elec|tion: And then, without any Proclamation made as was u&s;ual, one in a corner near the Mayor named <HI>Rich,</HI> and about thirty more applauded it, tho&s;e in the Hall, that was full of people and of noi&s;e, bearing nothing of it. Upon this it
<PB N="530" REF="545">
was &s;aid, that <HI>Rich</HI> was cho&s;en without any contradiction: And &s;o <HI>North</HI> and <HI>Rich</HI> were returned, and &s;worn Sheriffs for the en&s;uing year. The violence and the inju&s;tice with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Carried by the Court.</NOTE> which this matter was managed &s;hewed, that the Court was re&s;olved to carry that point at any rate: And this gave great occa&s;ions of jealou&s;y, that &s;ome wicked de&s;ign was on foot, for which it was nece&s;&s;ary in the fir&s;t place to be &s;ure of favourable Juries.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> upon this, knowing how obnoxious he was, went out of <HI>England.</HI> His voyage was fatal to him: He ju&s;t got to <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> to die in it. Of the la&s;t parts of his life I &s;hall have &s;ome occa&s;ion to make mention afterwards. When Michaelmas day came, tho&s;e who found how much they had been deceived in <HI>Moor</HI> re&s;olved to choo&s;e a <HI>Mayor</HI> that might be depended on. The poll was clo&s;ed when the Court thought they had the majority: But upon ca&s;ting it up it appeared they had lo&s;t it: So they fell to canva&s;s it: And they made &s;uch exceptions to tho&s;e of the other &s;ide, that they di&s;counted as many voices as gave them the majo|rity. This was al&s;o managed in &s;o gro&s;s a manner, that it was vi&s;ible the Court was re&s;olved by fair or foul means to have the government of the City in their own hands. But becau&s;e they would not be at this trouble, nor run this hazard every year, it was re&s;olved that the Charter of the City mu&s;t either be given up, or be adjudged to the King. The former was much the ea&s;ier way: So great pains was taken to manage the next election of the common Council, &s;o as that they might be tractable in this point. There was much inju&s;tice complained of in many of the wards of the City, both in the poll, and in the returns that were made. In order to the di&s;abling all the Di&s;&s;enters from having a vote in that election, the Bi&s;hop and Clergy of <HI>London</HI> were pre&s;&s;ed by the Court to pro&s;ecute them in the Church Courts, that &s;o they might excommunicate them; which &s;ome lawyers thought would render them incapable to vote, tho' other lawyers were very po&s;itively of another opinion. It is cer|tain it gave at lea&s;t a colour to deny them votes. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> began to apprehend, that things were running too fa&s;t, and was backward in the matter. The Clergy of the City refu&s;ed to make pre&s;entments: The law laid that on the Church-wardens: And &s;o they would not meddle officiou&s;ly. The King was di&s;plea&s;ed with them for their remi&s;&s;ne&s;s: But after all the practices of the Court, in the returns of the common Council of the City, they could
<PB N="531" REF="546">
not bring it near an equality for delivering up their Char|ter. <HI>Jenkins</HI> managed the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the City with &s;o many indirect practices, that the reputation he had for probity was much blemi&s;hed by it: He &s;eemed to think it was nece&s;&s;ary to bring the City to a dependence on the Court in the faire&s;t methods he could fall on; and, if the&s;e did not &s;ucceed, that then he was to take the mo&s;t effectual ones, hoping that a good intention would excu&s;e bad prac|tices.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI> had been di&s;graced after the Ex|clu&s;ion <NOTE PLACE="marg">Changes in the mini&s;try, and quarrels among them.</NOTE> Parliaments, as they were now called, were di&s;&s;olved: But the King had &s;o entire a confidence in him, and Lady <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> was &s;o much in his intere&s;ts, that upon great &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ions made to the Duke he was again re&s;tored to be Se|cretary this winter. Lord <HI>Hyde</HI> was the per&s;on that di&s;po|&s;ed the Duke to it: Upon that Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> and he fell to be in ill terms; for he hated Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI> beyond expre&s;&s;ion, tho' he had married his &s;i&s;ter. From Lord <HI>Sun|derland</HI>'s returning to his po&s;t all men concluded, that his declaring as he did for the Exclu&s;ion was certainly done by direction from the King, who naturally loved craft and a double game, that &s;o he might have proper in&s;truments to work by which way &s;oever he had turned him&s;elf in that affair. The King was the more de&s;irous to have Lord <HI>Sun|derland</HI> again near him, that he might have &s;ome body about him who under&s;tood foreign affairs. <HI>Jenkins</HI> under&s;tood no|thing: But he had &s;o much credit with the high Church party, that he was of great u&s;e to the Court. Lord <HI>Conway</HI> was brought in to be the other Secretary, who was &s;o very ignorant of foreign affairs, that his province being the <HI>North</HI> when one of the foreign mini&s;ters talked to him of the Cir|cles of <HI>Germany,</HI> it amazed him: He could not imagine what Circles had to do with affairs of &s;tate. He was now di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> and Lord <HI>Hyde</HI> fell to be in an open war, and were both much hated. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> charged <HI>Hyde,</HI> who was at this time made Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> of bribery, for having farmed a branch of the revenue much lower than had been profered for it. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> acquainted the King fir&s;t with it: And, as he told me, he de&s;ired Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> him&s;elf to examine into it, he being inclined to think it was rather an abu&s;e put on him than corruption in him&s;elf. But he &s;aw Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> was cold in the mat|ter, and in&s;tead of pro&s;ecuting any for it protected all concerned in it. He laid the complaint before the King in
<PB N="532" REF="547">
Council: And to convince the King how ill a bargain he had made, the complainers offered, if he would break the bargain, to give him 40000 <HI>l.</HI> more than he was to have from the farmers. He looked al&s;o into the other branches of the revenue, and found cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect much corruption in every one of them: And he got undertakers to offer at a farm of the whole revenue. In this he had all the Court on his &s;ide: For the King being now re&s;olved to live on his revenue, without putting him&s;elf on a Parliament, he was forced on a great reduction of expence: So that many payments run in arrear: And the whole Court was &s;o ill paid, that the offering any thing that would rai&s;e the revenue, and blemi&s;h the management of the trea&s;ury, was very ac|ceptable to all in it. Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> was al&s;o much hated: But the Duke and the Lady <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> both protected the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> &s;o powerfully, that even propo&s;itions to the King's advantage, which blemi&s;hed him, were not heark|ned to. This touched in too tender a place to admit of a reconciliation: The Duke forgot all Lord <HI>Halifax</HI>'s &s;ervice in the point of the Exclu&s;ion: And the dearne&s;s that was between them was now turned upon this to a cold|ne&s;s, and afterwards to a mo&s;t violent enmity. Upon this occa&s;ion Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> &s;ent for me, (for I went no more near any that belonged to the Court,) and he told me the whole matter. I a&s;ked him how he &s;tood with the King: He an|&s;wered, that neither he nor I had the making of the King: God had made him of a particular compo&s;ition. He &s;aid, he knew what the King &s;aid to him&s;elf: I a&s;ked him, if he knew likewi&s;e what he &s;aid to others; for he was apt to &s;ay to his &s;everal Mini&s;ters what&s;oever he thought would plea&s;e them, as long as he intended to make u&s;e of them. By the death of the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> the Seals were given to <HI>North,</HI> who was made Lord <HI>Guilford.</HI> He had not the vertues of his predece&s;&s;or: But he had parts far beyond him: They were turned to craft: So that whereas the former &s;eemed to mean well even when he did ill, this man was believed to mean ill even when he did well. The Court finding that the City of <HI>London</HI> could not be wrought on to &s;urrender their Charter, re&s;olved to have it condemned by a judgment in the King's bench. <HI>Jones</HI> had died in <HI>May:</HI> So now <HI>Pollexphen</HI> and <HI>Treby</HI> were chiefly relied on by the City in this matter. <HI>Sawyer</HI> was the Attorney General, a dull hot man, and forward to &s;erve all the de&s;igns of the
<PB N="533" REF="548">
Court. He undertook by the advice of <HI>Sanders,</HI> a learned but a very immoral man, to overthrow the Charter.</P>
<P>The two points upon which they re&s;ted the cau&s;e were, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The argu|ments for and again&s;t the Charter of <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> that the Common Council had petitioned the King upon a prorogation of Parliament that it might meet on the day to which it was prorogued, and had taxed the prorogation as that which occa&s;ioned a delay of ju&s;tice: This was con|&s;trued to be the rai&s;ing &s;edition, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the people with an ill opinion of the King and his government. The other point was, that the City had impo&s;ed new taxes on their wharfs and markets, which was an inva&s;ion of the liberty of the &s;ubject, and contrary to law. It was &s;aid, that all that the Crown gave was forfeitable back to the Crown again upon a male-ver&s;ation of the body; and that as the Common Council was the body of the City, cho&s;en by all the citizens, &s;o they were all involved in what the Common Council did: And they inferred, that &s;ince they had both &s;candalized the King's government, and op|pre&s;&s;ed their fellow &s;ubjects, they had thereupon forfeited their liberties: Many precedents were brought of the &s;eizing on the liberties of Towns and other Corporations, and of extingui&s;hing them.</P>
<P>The arguments again&s;t this were made by <HI>Treby,</HI> then the Recorder of <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>Pollexphen,</HI> who argued about three hours apiece. They laid it down for a foundation, that trading Corporations were immortal bodies for the breeding a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of trading men, and for perpetuating a fund of pub|lick chambers for the e&s;tates of orphans and tru&s;ts and for all pious endowments: That crimes committed by per&s;ons entru&s;ted in the government of them were per&s;onal things, which were only chargeable on tho&s;e who committed them, but could not affect the whole body: The trea&s;on of a Bi&s;hop, or a Clerk, only forfeited his title, but did not di&s;|&s;olve the Bi&s;hoprick, or Benefice: So the magi&s;trates only were to be puni&s;hed for their own crimes: An entailed e&s;tate, when a tenant for life was attainted, was not forfeited to the King, but went to the next in remainder upon his death. The government of a city, which was a temporary admi|ni&s;tration, ve&s;ted no property in the magi&s;trates: And there|fore they had nothing to forfeit, but what belonged to them|&s;elves: There were al&s;o expre&s;s acts of Parliament made in favour of the City, that it &s;hould not be puni&s;hed for the mi&s;demeanors of tho&s;e who bore office in it: They an|&s;wered the great objection that was brought from the for|feitures

of &s;ome Abbeys on the attainder of their Abbots in King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth's time, that there were peculiar laws made at that time, upon which tho&s;e forfeitures were ground|ed, which had been repealed &s;ince that time: All tho&s;e for|feitures were confirmed in Parliament: And that purged all defects: The Common Council was a &s;elected body, cho&s;en for particular ends: And if they went beyond the&s;e, they were liable to be puni&s;hed for it: If the petition they offer|ed the King was &s;editious, the King might proceed again&s;t every man that was concerned in it: And tho&s;e upon whom tho&s;e taxes had been levied, might bring their actions again&s;t tho&s;e who had levied them: But it &s;eemed very &s;trange, that when none of the petitioners were proceeded again&s;t for any thing contained in that petition, and when no ac|tions were brought on the account of tho&s;e taxes, that the whole body &s;hould &s;uffer in common for that, which none of tho&s;e who were immediately concerned in it had been &s;o much as brought in que&s;tion for in any Court of law: If the Common Council petitioned more earne&s;tly than was fitting for the &s;itting of the Parliament, that ought to be a&s;cribed to their zeal for the King's &s;afety, and for the e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion: And it ought not to be &s;trained to any other &s;en&s;e than to that which they profe&s;s in the body of their petition, much le&s;s to be carried &s;o far as to di&s;&s;olve the whole body on that account: And as for the tolls and taxes, the&s;e were things practi&s;ed in all the Corporations of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;eemed to be exactly according to law: The City &s;ince the fire had at a va&s;t charge made their wharfs and markets much more noble and convenient than they were before: And therefore they might well deny the benefit of them to tho&s;e who would not pay a new rate, that they &s;et on them for the payment of the debt con|tracted in building them: This was not the impo&s;ing a tax, but the rai&s;ing a rent out of a piece of ground, which the City might as well do, as a man who rebuilds his hou&s;e may rai&s;e the rent of it: All the precedents that were brought were examined and an&s;wered: Some Corporations were de|&s;erted, and &s;o upon the matter di&s;&s;olved them&s;elves: Judgments in &s;uch ca&s;es did not fit this in hand: The &s;eizing on the liberties of a Corporation did not di&s;&s;olve the body; for when a Bi&s;hop dies the King &s;eizes the temporalties; but the Corporation &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts; and they are re&s;tored to the next incumbent. There were indeed &s;ome very &s;trange precedents made in <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd's time: But they were
<PB N="535" REF="550">
followed by as &s;trange a rever&s;e: The Judges were hanged for the judgments they gave: They al&s;o in&s;i&s;ted on the effects that would follow on the forfeiting the Charter: The cu&s;tom of <HI>London</HI> was thereby broken: All the publick en|dowments, and charities lodged with the City mu&s;t revert to the heirs of the donors. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of the ar|gument, as I had it from <HI>Pollexphen.</HI> As for the more in|tricate points of law, I meddle not with them, but leave them to the learned men of that profe&s;&s;ion. When the mat|ter was brought near judgment, <HI>Sanders,</HI> who had laid the whole thing, was made Chief Ju&s;tice. <HI>Pemberton,</HI> who was not &s;atisfied in the point, being removed to the Common Pleas upon <HI>North's</HI> advancement. <HI>Dolben,</HI> a Judge of the King's bench, was found not to be clear: So he was turned out, and <HI>Withins</HI> came in his room. When &s;entence was to be <NOTE PLACE="marg">Judgment given in the matter.</NOTE> given, <HI>Sanders</HI> was &s;truck with an apoplexy: So he could not come into Court: But he &s;ent his judgment in writing, and died a few days after. The &s;entence was given without the &s;olemnity that was u&s;ual upon great occa&s;ions: The Judges were wont formerly in delivering their opinions to make long arguments, in which they &s;et forth the grounds of law on which they went, which were great in&s;tructions to the &s;tudents and barri&s;ters: But that had been laid a&s;ide ever &s;ince <HI>Hale</HI>'s time.</P>
<P>The judgment now given was, that a city might forfeit its Charter; that the male-ver&s;ations of the Common Coun|cil were the acts of the whole City, and that the two points &s;et forth in the pleadings were ju&s;t grounds for the forfeiting of a Charter. Upon which premi&s;&s;es the proper conclu&s;ion &s;eemed to be, that therefore the City of <HI>London</HI> had forfeited their Charter: But the con&s;equences of that were &s;o much apprehended, that they did not think fit to venture on it: So they judged, that the King might &s;eize the liberties of the City. The Attorney General moved, contrary to what is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es, that the judgment might not be re|corded. And upon that new endeavours were u&s;ed to bring the Common Council to deliver up their Charter: Yet that could not be compa&s;&s;ed, tho' it was brought much nearer in the numbers of the voices than was imagined could ever be done.</P>
<P>There were other very &s;evere proceedings at this time <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some other &s;evere $udg|ments.</NOTE> with relation to particular per&s;ons. <HI>Pilkinton</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>London</HI> the former year; an hone&s;t but an indi&s;creet man, that gave him&s;elf great liberties in di&s;cour&s;e. He being de|&s;ired
<PB N="536" REF="551">
to go along with the Mayor and Aldermen to com|plement the Duke upon his return from <HI>Scotland</HI> declined going, and reflected on him as one concerned in the burning of the City. Two Aldermen &s;aid they heard that, and &s;wore it again&s;t him. Sir <HI>Patience Ward,</HI> the Mayor of the for|mer year, &s;eeing him go in to that di&s;cour&s;e had diverted him from it, but heard not the words which the others &s;wore to: And he depo&s;ed, that to the be&s;t of his remembrance he &s;aid not tho&s;e words. <HI>Pilkinton</HI> was ca&s;t in an 100000 <HI>l.</HI> dama|ges, the mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive that had ever been given. But the matter did not &s;top there: <HI>Ward</HI> was indicted of perjury, it being &s;aid, that &s;ince he &s;wore that the words were not &s;poken, and that the Jury had given a verdict upon the evidence that they were &s;poken, by con&s;equence he was guilty of perjury. It was &s;aid on the other &s;ide, that when two &s;wear one way, and a third &s;wears another way, a Jury may believe the two better than the one: But it is not certain from thence that he is perjured: If that were law, no man would be a witne&s;s; if, becau&s;e they of the other &s;ide were believed, he &s;hould be therefore convicted of per|jury. A man's &s;wearing to a negative, that &s;uch words were not &s;poken, did only amount to this, that he did not hear them: And it would be hard to prove that he who &s;wore &s;o had heard them. But <HI>Ward</HI> proved by him that took the trial in &s;hort hand, as he had done &s;ome others with great approbation, that he had &s;aid, <HI>to the be&s;t of his re|membrance the&s;e words were not &s;poken by Pilkinton:</HI> Upon which <HI>Jefferies</HI> had &s;aid, that his invention was better than his memory: And the Attorney General in &s;umming up the evidence to the Jury had &s;aid, they ought to have no regard to <HI>Ward's</HI> evidence, &s;ince he had only depo&s;ed upon his memory. Yet that Jury returned <HI>Ward</HI> guilty of perjury: And it was intended, if he had not gone out of the way, to have &s;et him on the pillory. The truth is, Juries be|came at that time the &s;hame of the nation, as well as a reproach to religion: For they were packt, and prepared to bring in verdicts as they were directed and not as mat|ters appeared on the evidence.</P>
<P>Thus affairs were going on all the year eighty two, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">1683 All people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with great fears.</NOTE> to the beginning of eighty three. The Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> had been for making u&s;e of the heat the City was in during the conte&s;t about the Sheriffs; and thought they might have created a great di&s;turbance, and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the Tower: And he believed, the fir&s;t appearance of the
<PB N="537" REF="552">
lea&s;t di&s;order would have prevailed on the King to yield every thing. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> who under&s;tood what a rabble was and what troops were, looked on this as a mad expo&s;ing of them&s;elves and of their friends. The Lords <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> were of the &s;ame mind. So Lord <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> &s;eeing they could not be engaged into action, flew out again&s;t them. He &s;aid, the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was &s;ent into the party by the King for this end, to keep all things quiet till the Court had gained its point: He &s;aid, Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had al&s;o made his bargain, and was to go to <HI>Ireland;</HI> and that among them Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> was deceived. With this he endeavoured to bla&s;t them in the City: They &s;tudied to prevent the ill effects that tho&s;e jealou&s;ies which he was in|fu&s;ing into the citizens might have among them. So the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> gave an appointment to Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> or &s;ome of his friends to meet him, and &s;ome others that he &s;hould bring along with him, at <HI>Shepherd</HI>'s, a wine mer|chant <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monmouth <HI>and</HI> Ru&s;&s;el <HI>at</HI> Shepherd&punc;</NOTE> in whom they had an entire confidence. The night before this appointment Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> came to town on the account of his uncle's illne&s;s. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> went to him, and told him of the appointment, and de&s;ired he would go thither with him: He con&s;ented, the rather be|cau&s;e he intended to ta&s;t &s;ome of that merchant's wine. At night they went with Lord <HI>Grey</HI> and Sir <HI>Thomas Arm&s;trong.</HI> When they came, they found none there but <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Fergu&s;on,</HI> two of Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI>'s tools that he employed: Upon which, they &s;eeing no better company re&s;olved im|mediately to go back. But Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> called for a ta&s;t of the wines: And while they were bringing it him up, <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI> fell into a di&s;cour&s;e of &s;urprizing the guards. <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> fancied it might have been ea&s;ily done: <HI>Arm&s;trong,</HI> that had commanded them, &s;hewed him his mi&s;takes. This was no con&s;ultation about what was to be done, but only about what might have been done. Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> &s;poke nothing upon the &s;ubject: But as &s;oon as he had ta&s;ted his wines they went away. It may &s;eem, that this is too light a pa&s;&s;age to be told &s;o copiou&s;ly: But much depends on it. Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> had one meeting with the Earls of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Salisbury</HI> before he went out of <HI>England.</HI> Fear, anger, and di&s;appointment, had wrought &s;o much on him, that Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> told me he was much broken in his thoughts: His notions were wild and impracticable: And he was glad that he was gone out of <HI>England:</HI> But &s;aid, that he had done them already a great deal of mi&s;chief,
<PB N="538" REF="553">
and would have done more if he had &s;tayed. As &s;oon as he was gone, the Lords and all the chief men of the party &s;aw their danger from forward Sheriffs, willing Juries, mer|cenary Judges, and bold witne&s;&s;es. So they re&s;olved to go home, and be &s;ilent, to &s;peak and to meddle as little as might be in publick bu&s;ine&s;s, and to let the pre&s;ent ill tem|per the Nation was fallen into wear out: For they did not doubt but the Court, e&s;pecially as it was now managed by the Duke, would &s;oon bring the Nation again into its wits by their ill conduct and proceedings. All that was to be done was, to keep up as much as they could a good &s;pirit with relation to elections of Parliament, if one &s;hould be called.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> re&s;olved to be advi&s;ed chiefly by <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Monmouth</HI> and &s;ome o|thers meet often toge|ther.</NOTE> Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> He would not be alone in that, but named Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> again&s;t whom no objection could lie: And next to him he named <HI>Algernoon Sidney,</HI> brother to the Earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> a man of mo&s;t extraordinary courage, a &s;teady man, even to ob&s;tinacy, &s;incere, but of a rough and boi&s;te|rous temper that could not bear contradiction. He &s;eemed to be a Chri&s;tian, but in a particular form of his own: He thought, it was to be like a Divine Philo&s;ophy in the mind: But he was again&s;t all publick wor&s;hip, and every thing that looked like a Church. He was &s;tiff to all republican prin|ciples; and &s;uch an enemy to every thing that looked like monarchy, that he &s;et him&s;elf in a high oppo&s;ition again&s;t <HI>Cromwell</HI> when he was made Protector. He had &s;tudied the hi&s;tory of government in all its branches beyond any man I ever knew. He was Amba&s;&s;ador in <HI>Denmark</HI> at the time of the Re&s;toration, but did not come back till the year &s;eventy eight, when the Parliament was pre&s;&s;ing the King into a war. The Court of <HI>France</HI> obtained leave for him to return. He did all he could to divert people from that war: So that &s;ome took him for a pen&s;ioner of <HI>France:</HI> But to tho&s;e to whom he dur&s;t &s;peak freely he &s;aid, he knew it was all a juggle; that our Court was in an entire confi|dence with <HI>France,</HI> and had no other de&s;ign in this &s;hew of a war but to rai&s;e an army, and keep it beyond &s;ea till it was trained and modelled. <HI>Sidney</HI> had a particular way of in&s;inuating him&s;elf into people that would hearken to his notions, and not contradict him. He tried me: But I was not &s;o &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive a hearer: So we lived afterwards at a great di&s;tance. He wrought him&s;elf into Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s confidence to &s;uch a degree, that he became the ma&s;ter of his &s;pirit.
<PB N="539" REF="554">
He had a great kindne&s;s for Lord <HI>Howard,</HI> as was formerly told: For that Lord hated both the King and monarchy as much as he him&s;elf did. He prevailed on Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> to take Lord <HI>Howard</HI> into their &s;ecrets, tho' Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch an ill opinion of him a little before to me, as to &s;ay he wondred how any man would tru&s;t him&s;elf alone with him. Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> tho' his cou&s;in german, had the &s;ame ill opinion of him. Yet <HI>Sidney</HI> overcame both their aver&s;ions. Lord <HI>Howard</HI> had made the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> enter into confidence with <HI>Sidney,</HI> who u&s;ed to &s;peak very &s;lightly of him, and to &s;ay, it was all one to him whether <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>York</HI> or <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was to &s;uc|ceed. Yet Lord <HI>Howard</HI> perhaps put a notion into him, which he offered often to me, that a Prince who knew there was a flaw in his title would always govern well, and con&s;i|der him&s;elf as at the mercy of the right heir if he was not in all things in the intere&s;ts and hearts of his people, which was often neglected by Princes that relied on an undoubted title. Lord <HI>Howard</HI> by a trick put both on the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> and <HI>Sidney</HI> brought them to be acquainted. He told <HI>Sidney</HI> that the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was re&s;olved to come &s;ome day alone and dine with him: And he made the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> believe that <HI>Sidney</HI> de&s;ired this, that &s;o he might not &s;eem to come and court the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth:</HI> And &s;aid that &s;ome regard was to be had to his temper and age. <HI>Hamden</HI> was al&s;o taken into their &s;ecret: He was the grand&s;on of him that had pleaded the cau&s;e of <HI>England</HI> in the point of the &s;hip money with King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t. His father was a very eminent man, and had been zealous in the Exclu&s;ion: He was a young man of great parts; one of the learnede&s;t Gentlemen I have ever known; for he was a critick both in <HI>Latin, Greek,</HI> and <HI>Hebrew:</HI> He was a man of great heat and vivacity, but too unequal in his temper: He had once great principles of re|ligion: But he was much corrupted by <HI>P. Simon</HI>'s conver&s;ati|on at <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>With the&s;e men the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> met often. His <NOTE PLACE="marg">They tr$span$ with &s;om$span$ the <HI>Sco$span$</HI> Nation.</NOTE> intere&s;t in <HI>Scotland,</HI> both by the dependance that his wife's great e&s;tate brought him, but chiefly by the knowledge he had of their affairs while he was among them, and by the con|fidence he knew they had all in him, made him turn his thoughts much towards that Kingdom as the propere&s;t &s;cene of acti|on. He had met often with Lord <HI>Argile</HI> while he was in <HI>London,</HI> and had many conferences with him of the &s;tate
<PB N="540" REF="555">
of that Kingdom, and of what might be done there: And he thought the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Carolina</HI> was a very proper blind to bring up &s;ome of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Gentlemen under the appear|ance of treating about that. They upon this agreed to &s;end one <HI>Aaron Smith</HI> to <HI>Scotland,</HI> to de&s;ire that &s;ome men of ab|&s;olute confidence might be &s;ent up for that end. So when the Proclamation that was formerly mentioned was pub|li&s;hed, it &s;pread &s;uch an univer&s;al apprehen&s;ion thro' all the &s;u&s;pected counties, that they looked on them&s;elves as marked out to de&s;truction: And it is very natural for people under &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions to &s;et them&s;elves to look out for remedies as &s;oon as they can.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>April</HI> &s;ome of them came up. The per&s;on that was mo&s;t entirely tru&s;ted, and to whom the journey proved fatal, was <HI>Ballie,</HI> of who&s;e unju&s;t treatment upon <HI>Car&s;tairs</HI>'s information an account was formerly given. He was my cou&s;in german: So I knew him well. He was in the pre&s;byterian principles, but was a man of great piety and vertue, learned in the law, in mathematics, and in lan|guages: I went to him, as &s;oon as I heard he was come, in great &s;implicity of heart, thinking of nothing but of <HI>Carolina.</HI> I was only afraid they might go too much into the com|pany of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and give true repre&s;entations of the &s;tate of affairs in <HI>Scotland:</HI> This might be reported about by men that would name them: And that might bring them into trouble. But a few weeks after I found they came not to me as they were wont to do: And I heard they were often with Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el.</HI> I was apprehen&s;ive of this: And Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> being in the country, I went to him, to warn him of the danger I feared Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> might be brought into by this conver&s;ation with my countrymen. He diverted me from all my apprehen&s;ions; and told me, I might de|pend on it, Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> would be in nothing without ac|quainting him: And he &s;eemed to agree entirely with me, that a ri&s;ing in the &s;tate in which things were then would be fatal. I always &s;aid, that when the root of the con&s;ti|tution was &s;truck at to be overturned, then I thought &s;ub|jects might defend them&s;elves: But I thought jealou&s;ies and fears, and particular acts of inju&s;tice, could not warrant this. He did agree with me in this: He thought, the obligation between Prince and &s;ubject was &s;o equally mutual, that upon a breach on the one &s;ide the other was free: But tho' he thought the late inju&s;tice in <HI>London,</HI> and the end that was driven at by it, did &s;et them at liberty to look to them|&s;elves,
<PB N="541" REF="556">
yet he confe&s;&s;ed things were not ripe enough yet, and that an ill laid and an ill managed ri&s;ing would be our ruin. I was then newly come from writing my hi&s;to|ry of the Reformation; and did &s;o evidently &s;ee, that the &s;truggle for Lady <HI>Jean Grey,</HI> and <HI>Wyat</HI>'s ri&s;ing, was that which threw the nation &s;o quickly into Popery after King <HI>Edward</HI>'s days, (for &s;uch as had rendred them&s;elves obnox|ious in tho&s;e matters &s;aw no other way to &s;ecure them&s;elves, and found their turning was a &s;ure one,) that I was now very apprehen&s;ive of this; be&s;ides that I thought it was yet unlaw|ful. What pa&s;t between the <HI>Scots</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lords I know not; only that Lord <HI>Argile,</HI> who was then in <HI>Holland,</HI> a&s;ked at fir&s;t 20000 <HI>l.</HI> for buying a &s;tock of arms and ammu|nition, which he afterwards brought down to 8000 <HI>l.</HI> and a thou&s;and hor&s;e to be &s;ent into <HI>Scotland:</HI> Upon which he undertook the conduct of that matter. I know no further than general hints of their matters: For tho' <HI>Hamden</HI> offered fre|quently to give me a particular account of it all, knowing that I was writing the hi&s;tory of that time, yet I told him, that till by an indemnity that whole matter was buried I would know none of tho&s;e &s;ecrets, which I might be obliged to reveal, or to lie and deny my knowledge of them: So to avoid that I put it off at that time. And when I re|turned to <HI>England</HI> at the Revolution, we appointed often to meet, in order to a full relation of it all. But by &s;everal accidents it went off, as a thing is apt to do which one can recover at any time. And &s;o his unhappy end came on be|fore I had it from him. I know this, that no money was rai&s;ed. But the thing had got &s;ome vent; for my own bro|ther, a zealous Pre&s;byterian, who was come from <HI>Scotland,</HI> it not being &s;afe for him to live any longer in that King|dom knowing that he had conver&s;ed with many that had been in the rebellion, told me, there was certainly &s;omewhat in agitation among them, about which &s;ome of their teachers had let out &s;omewhat very freely to him&s;elf: How far that matter went, and how the &s;cheme was laid, I cannot tell; and &s;o mu&s;t leave it in the dark. Their contract for the project of <HI>Carolina</HI> &s;eemed to go on apace: They had &s;ent &s;ome thi|ther the former year, who were now come back, and brought them a particular account of every thing: They likewi&s;e, to cover their negotiations with Lord <HI>Argile,</HI> &s;ent &s;ome over to him; but with the blind of in&s;tructions for buying &s;hips in <HI>Holland,</HI> and other things nece&s;&s;ary for their tran&s;por|tation.</P>
<P><PB N="542" REF="557">
While this matter was thus in a clo&s;e management among them, there was another company of Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI>'s crea|tures that met in the Temple in the chambers of one <HI>We&s;t,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Con|&s;pirators meet at the &s;ame time on de&s;igns of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the King.</NOTE> a witty and active man, full of talk, and believed to be a de|termined Athei&s;t. <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Fergu&s;on</HI> came con&s;tantly thi|ther. The former of the&s;e was an officer in <HI>Cronnvell</HI>'s army, who went into <HI>Portugal</HI> with the forces that &s;erved there un|der <HI>Schomberg.</HI> He did a brave action in that &s;ervice: And <HI>Schomberg</HI> writ a particular letter to the King &s;etting it out: Upon which he got a place: And he had applied him&s;elf to Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> as his patron. He was much tru&s;ted by him, and &s;ent often about on me&s;&s;ages. Once or twice he came to Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> but it was upon indifferent things. Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> &s;aid to me, that at that very time he felt &s;uch a &s;ecret aver&s;ion to him, that he was in no danger of tru&s;ting him much. He was one of the bold talkers, and kept chiefly among Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI>'s creatures. He was up|on all the &s;ecret of his going beyond &s;ea; which &s;eemed to &s;hew, that he was not then a &s;py of the Court's, which &s;ome &s;u&s;pected he was all along. <HI>Fergu&s;on</HI> was a hot and a bold man, who&s;e &s;pirit was naturally turned to plotting: He was al|ways unquiet, and &s;etting people on to &s;ome mi&s;chief: I knew a private thing of him, by which it appeared he was a profligate knave, and could cheat tho&s;e that tru&s;ted him en|tirely: So tho' he, being a <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> man, took all the ways he could to be admitted into &s;ome acquaintance with me, I would never &s;ee him, or &s;peak with him: And I did not know his face till the Revolution: He was ca&s;t out by the Pre&s;byterians; and then went among the Independents, where his boldne&s;s rai&s;ed him to &s;ome figure, tho' he was at bottom a very empty man: He had the management of a &s;ecret pre&s;s, and of a pur&s;e that maintained it: And he gave about mo&s;t of the pamphlets writ of that &s;ide: And with &s;ome he pa&s;t for the author of them: And &s;uch was his vanity, becau&s;e this made him more con&s;iderable, that he was not ill plea&s;ed to have that believed; tho' it only ex|po&s;ed him &s;o much the more. With the&s;e <HI>Goodenough,</HI> who had been Under-Sheriff of <HI>London</HI> in <HI>Bethel</HI>'s year, and one <HI>Halloway</HI> of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> met often, and had a great deal of rambling di&s;cour&s;e, to &s;hew how ea&s;y a thing it was of the &s;udden to rai&s;e four thou&s;and men in the City. <HI>Goodenough</HI> by rea&s;on of his office knew the City well, and pretended he knew many men of &s;o much credit in every corner of it, and on whom they might depend, as could rai&s;e that num|ber,
<PB N="543" REF="558">
which he reckoned would quickly grow much &s;tronger: And it is probable, this was the &s;cheme with which Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that he thought it might be de|pended on. They had many di&s;cour&s;es of the heads of a declaration proper for &s;uch a ri&s;ing, and di&s;puted of the&s;e with much &s;ubtilty as they thought: And they intended to &s;end <HI>Halloway</HI> to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> to try what could be done there at the &s;ame time. But all this was only talk, and went no further than to a few of their own confidents. <HI>Rum&s;ey, Fergu&s;on,</HI> and <HI>We&s;t</HI> were often talking of the danger of ex|ecuting this, and that the &s;horter and &s;urer way was to kill the two brothers. One <HI>Rumbold,</HI> who had &s;erved in <HI>Crom|well</HI>'s army, came twice among them; and while they were in that wicked di&s;cour&s;e, which they expre&s;&s;ed by the term <HI>lopping.</HI> He upon that told them, he had a farm near <HI>Hod&s;den</HI> in the way to <HI>New-Market:</HI> And there was a moat ca&s;t round his hou&s;e, thro' which the King &s;ometimes pa&s;t in his way thither. He &s;aid, once the coach went thro' quite alone, without any of the guards about it; and that, if he had laid any thing cro&s;s the way to have &s;topt the coach but a minute, he could have &s;hot them both, and have rode away thro' grounds that he knew &s;o well that it &s;hould not have been po&s;&s;ible to have followed him. Upon which they ran into much wicked talk about the way of executing that. But nothing was ever fixed on: All was but talk. At one time Lord <HI>Howard</HI> was among them: And they talked over their &s;everal &s;chemes of lopping. One of them was to be executed in the Play Hou&s;e. Lord <HI>Howard</HI> &s;aid, he liked that be&s;t, for then they would die in their calling. This was &s;o like his way of talk, that it was ea&s;ily believed, tho' he always denied it. <HI>Walcot,</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Gentleman that had been of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s army, was now in <HI>London,</HI> and got into that company: And he was made believe, that the thing was &s;o well laid that many both in City and Country were en|gaged in it. He liked the project of a ri&s;ing, but declared he would not meddle in their lopping. So this wicked knot of men continued their caballings from the time that the Earl of <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> went away: And the&s;e were the &s;ubjects of their di&s;cour&s;es. The King went con&s;tantly to <HI>New-Market</HI> for about a Month both in <HI>April</HI> and <HI>October.</HI> In <HI>April</HI> while he was there a fire broke out, and burnt a part of the town: Upon which the King came back a week &s;ooner than he intended.</P>
<P><PB N="544" REF="559">
While all the&s;e things were thus going on, there was one <HI>Keeling,</HI> an Anabapti&s;t in <HI>London,</HI> who was &s;inking in his bu&s;ine&s;s, and began to think that of a witne&s;s would be the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A plot is di&s;covered.</NOTE> better trade. <HI>Goodenough</HI> had employed him often to try their &s;trength in the City, and to count on whom they could depend for a &s;udden ri&s;ing: He had al&s;o talked to him of the de&s;ign of killing the two brothers: So he went and di&s;covered all he could to <HI>Leg,</HI> at that time made Lord <HI>Dartmouth. Leg</HI> made no great account of it, but &s;ent him to <HI>Jenkins. Jenkins</HI> took his depo&s;itions, but told him he could not proceed in it without more witne&s;&s;es: So he went to his brother, who was a man of heat in his way, but of probity, who did not incline to ill de&s;igns, and le&s;s to di&s;cover them. <HI>Keeling</HI> carried his brother to <HI>Goodenough,</HI> and a&s;&s;ured him he might be depended on. So <HI>Goodenough</HI> run out into a rambling di&s;cour&s;e of what they both could and would do: And he al&s;o &s;poke of killing the King and the Duke, which would make their work ea&s;y. When they left him the di&s;co|verer pre&s;&s;ed his brother to go along with him to <HI>We&s;tmini&s;ter,</HI> where he pretended bu&s;ine&s;s, but &s;topt at <HI>White-Hall.</HI> The other was unea&s;y, longing to get out of his company, to go to &s;ome friends for advice upon what had hapned. But he drew him on: And at la&s;t, he not knowing whether he was going, he drew him into <HI>Jenkins</HI>'s office; and there told the Secretary he had brought another witne&s;s, who had heard the &s;ub&s;tance of the plot from <HI>Goodenough</HI>'s own mouth ju&s;t then. His brother was deeply &s;truck with this cheat and &s;urprize, but could not avoid the making oath to <HI>Jenkins</HI> of all he had heard. The Secretary, who&s;e phlegmatick head was not turned for &s;uch a work, let them both go, and &s;ent out no warrants, till he had communicated the matter to the re&s;t of the Mini&s;try, the King being then at <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI> So <HI>Keeling,</HI> who had been thus drawn into the &s;nare by his brother, &s;ent adverti&s;ements to <HI>Goodenough,</HI> and all the other per&s;ons whom he had named, to go out of the way.</P>
<P><HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> and <HI>We&s;t</HI> were at this time perpetually together: And apprehending that they had tru&s;ted them&s;elves to too many per&s;ons, who might di&s;cover them, they laid a &s;tory, in which they re&s;olved to agree it &s;o well together, that they &s;hould not contradict one another. They framed their <NOTE PLACE="marg">A forged &s;tory laid by <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> and <HI>We&s;t</HI></NOTE> &s;tory thus: That they had laid the de&s;ign of their ri&s;ing to be executed on the &s;eventeenth of <HI>November,</HI> the day of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s coming to the Crown, on which the citi|zens
<PB N="545" REF="560">
u&s;ed to run together, and carry about Popes in pro|ce&s;&s;ion, and burn them: So that day &s;eemed proper to cover their running together, till they met in a body. Others, they &s;aid, thought it be&s;t to do nothing on that day, the rout being u&s;ually at night, but to lay their ri&s;ing for the next Sunday at the hour of people's being at Church. This was laid to &s;hew how near the matter was to the being ex|ecuted. But the part of their &s;tory that was the be&s;t laid, (for this looked ridiculous, &s;ince they could not name any one per&s;on of any condition that was to head this ri&s;ing,) was, that they pretended that <HI>Rumbold</HI> had offered them his hou&s;e in the Heath for executing the de&s;ign. It was cal|led <HI>Rye:</HI> And from thence this was called the <HI>Rye-Plot.</HI> He a&s;ked forty men, well armed and mounted, whom <HI>Rum|&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Walcot</HI> were to command in two parties: The one was to engage the guards, if they &s;hould be near the coach: And the other was to &s;top the coach, and to murder the King and the Duke. <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> took the wicked part on him&s;elf, &s;aying, that <HI>Walcot</HI> had made a &s;cruple of killing the King, but none of engaging the guards: So <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> was to do the execution. And they &s;aid, they were divided in their minds what to do next: Some were for defending the moat till night, and then to have gone off: Others were for riding thro' grounds in a &s;horter way towards the <HI>Thames.</HI> Of the&s;e forty they could name but eight. But it was pretended that <HI>Walcot, Goodenough,</HI> and <HI>Rumbold</HI> had undertaken to find both the re&s;t of the men, and the hor&s;es: For, tho' upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion men would have taken care to have had &s;ure and well tried hor&s;es, this al&s;o was &s;aid to be tru&s;ted to others. As for arms, <HI>We&s;t</HI> had bought &s;ome, as on a commi&s;&s;ion for a plantation: And the&s;e were &s;aid to be &s;ome of the arms with which they were to be furni&s;hed; tho' when they were &s;een they &s;eemed very improper for &s;uch a &s;ervice. I &s;aw all <HI>We&s;t</HI>'s narrative, which was put in Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>'s hands: And a friend of mine borrowed it of him, and lent it me. They were &s;o wi&s;e at Court that they would not &s;uffer it to be printed; for then it would have ap|peared too gro&s;s to be believed.</P>
<P>But the part of it all that &s;eemed the mo&s;t amazing was, that it was to have been executed on the day in which the King had intended to return from <HI>New-Market:</HI> But the happy fire that &s;ent him away a week &s;ooner had quite de|feated the whole plot, while it was within a week of its exe|cution, and neither hor&s;es, men, nor arms yet pro|vided.
<PB N="546" REF="561">
This &s;eemed to be &s;o eminent a Providence, that the whole nation was &s;truck with it: And both preachers and poets had a noble &s;ubject to enlarge on, and to &s;hew how much the King and the Duke were under the watchful care of Providence.</P>
<P>Within three days after <HI>Keeling</HI>'s di&s;covery the plot broke out, and became the whole di&s;cour&s;e of the Town. Many examinations were taken, and &s;everal per&s;ons were clapt up upon it. Among the&s;e <HI>Wildman</HI> was one, who had been an agitator in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s army, and had oppo&s;ed his Protector|&s;hip. After the Re&s;toration he being looked on as a high republican was kept long in pri&s;on; where he had &s;tudied law and phy&s;ick &s;o much, that he pa&s;t as a man very knowing in tho&s;e matters. He had a way of creating in others a great opinion of his &s;agacity, and had great credit with the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and was now very active under <HI>Sidney</HI>'s conduct. He was &s;eized on, and his hou&s;e was &s;earch|ed: In his cellars there hapned to be two &s;mall field-pieces that belonged to the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and that lay in York-Hou&s;e when that was &s;old, and was to be pulled down: <HI>Wildman</HI> carried tho&s;e two pieces, which were finely wrought, but of little u&s;e, into his cellars, where they were laid on ordinary wooden carriages, and no way fitted for any &s;ervice: Yet the&s;e were carried to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and expo&s;ed to view, as an undeniable proof of a rebellion de&s;igned, &s;ince here was their cannon.</P>
<P>Several per&s;ons came to me from Court, a&s;&s;uring me that there was full proof made of a plot. Lord <HI>Howard</HI> com|ing &s;oon after them to &s;ee me talked of the whole matter in his &s;piteful way with &s;o much &s;corn, that I really thought he knew of nothing, and by con&s;equence I believed there was no truth in all the&s;e di&s;coveries. He &s;aid, the Court knew they were &s;ure of Juries, and they would furni&s;h them|&s;elves quickly with witne&s;&s;es: And he &s;poke of the Duke as of one that would be wor&s;e, not only than Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> but than <HI>Nero:</HI> And with eyes and hands lifted to heaven he vowed to me, that he knew of no plot, and that he believ|ed nothing of it.</P>
<P>Two days after, a Proclamation came out for &s;eizing on &s;ome who could not be found: And among the&s;e <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> and <HI>We&s;t</HI> were named. The next day <HI>We&s;t</HI> delivered him|&s;elf: And <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> came in a day after him. The&s;e two brought out their &s;tory, which, how incredible &s;oever it was, pa&s;t &s;o for certain, that any man that &s;eemed to doubt it was

concluded to be in it. That of defending them&s;elves within mud walls and a moat looked like the invention of a law|yer, who could not lay a military contrivance with any &s;ort of probability. Nor did it appear where the forty hor&s;e were to be lodged, and how they were to be brought toge|ther. All the&s;e were thought objections that could be made by none but tho&s;e who either were of it, or wi&s;hed well to it. The&s;e new witne&s;&s;es had al&s;o heard of the conferences that the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and the other Lords had with tho&s;e who were come from <HI>Scotland,</HI> but knew nothing of it them&s;elves. <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> did likewi&s;e remember the di&s;cour&s;e at <HI>Shepherd</HI>'s.</P>
<P>When the Council found the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> and Lord <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> and &s;ome others were put in pri&s;on upon it.</NOTE> <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> were named, they writ to the King to come to <HI>London:</HI> They would not venture to go further without his pre&s;ence and leave. A me&s;&s;enger of the Council was &s;ent the morn|ing before the King came to wait at Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s gate, to have &s;topt him if he had offered to go out. This was ob|&s;erved; for he walked many hours there: And it was looked on as done on purpo&s;e to frighten him away; for his back gate was not watched: So for &s;everal hours he might have gone away if he had intended it. He heard that <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> had named him: But he knew he had not tru&s;ted him, and he never reflected on the di&s;cour&s;e at <HI>Shepherd</HI>'s. He &s;ent his wife among his friends for advice. They were of diffe|rent minds: But &s;ince he &s;aid he apprehended nothing from any thing he had &s;aid to <HI>Rum&s;ey,</HI> they thought his going out of the way would give the Court too great an advan|tage, and would look like a confe&s;&s;ing of guilt. So this agree|ing with his own mind, he &s;tayed at home till the King was come: And then a me&s;&s;enger was &s;ent to carry him be|fore the Council. He received it very compo&s;edly, and went thither. <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> had al&s;o &s;aid, that at <HI>Shepherd</HI>'s there was &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Trenchard</HI>'s undertaking to rai&s;e a body out of <HI>Taunton,</HI> and of his failing in it: So Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> was examined upon that, the King telling him, that no body &s;u&s;pected him of any de&s;ign again&s;t his per&s;on, but that he had good evidence of his being in de&s;igns again&s;t his govern|ment. Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> prote&s;ted, he had heard nothing relat|ing to <HI>Trenchard:</HI> And &s;aid to the la&s;t, that either it was a fiction of <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI>'s, or it had pa&s;t between him and <HI>Arm&s;trong,</HI> while he was walking about the room, or ta&s;ting the wines at <HI>Shepherd</HI>'s; for he had not heard a word of it. Upon all this he was &s;ent a clo&s;e pri&s;oner to the Tower.</P>
<P><PB N="548" REF="563">
<HI>Sidney</HI> was brought next before the Council. But his ex|amination la&s;ted not long. He &s;aid, he mu&s;t make the be&s;t defence he could, if they had any proof again&s;t him: But he would not fortify their evidence by any thing he &s;hould &s;ay. And indeed that was the wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e; for the an&s;wering que&s;tions upon &s;uch examinations is a very dangerous thing: Every word that is &s;aid is laid hold on, that can be turned again&s;t a man's &s;elf or his friends, and no regard is had to what he might &s;ay in favour of them: And it had been happy for the re&s;t, e&s;pecially for <HI>Baillie,</HI> if they had all held to this maxim. There was at that time no &s;ort of evidence again&s;t <HI>Sidney,</HI> &s;o that his commitment was again&s;t law. <HI>Trenchard</HI> was al&s;o examined: He denied every thing. But one point of his guilt was well known: He was the fir&s;t man that had moved the Exclu&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of Commons: So he was reckoned a lo&s;t man.</P>
<P><HI>Baillie</HI> and two other Gentlemen of <HI>Scotland,</HI> both <HI>Camp|bell</HI>'s had changed their lodgings while the Town was in this fermentation: And upon that they were &s;eized on as &s;u&s;pec|ted per&s;ons, and brought before the King. He him&s;elf exa|mined them, and fir&s;t que&s;tioned them about the de&s;ign again&s;t his per&s;on, which they very frankly an&s;wered, and denied they knew any thing about it. Then he a&s;ked them, if they had been in any con&s;ultations with Lords or others in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> in order to an in&s;urrection in <HI>Scotland. Baillie</HI> faultred at this: For his con&s;cience re&s;trained him from lying. He &s;aid, he did not know the importance of tho&s;e que&s;tions, nor what u&s;e might be made of his an&s;wers: He de&s;ired to &s;ee them in writing, and then he would con&s;ider how to an&s;wer them. Both the King and the Duke threatned him upon this: And he &s;eemed to neglect that with &s;o much of the air of a Philo&s;opher, that it provoked them out of mea&s;ure again&s;t him. The other two were &s;o lately come from <HI>Scotland,</HI> that they had &s;een no body, and knew nothing. <HI>Baillie</HI> was loaded by a &s;pecial direction with very heavy irons: So that for &s;ome weeks his life was a burden to him. <HI>Cockran,</HI> an|other of tho&s;e who had been concern'd in this Treaty, was complained of, as having talked very freely of the Duke's government of <HI>Scotland.</HI> Upon which the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Secretary &s;ent a note to him de&s;iring him to come to him; for it was intended only to give him a reprimand, and to have order|ed him to go to <HI>Scotland.</HI> But he knew his own &s;ecret: So he left his lodgings, and got beyond &s;ea. This &s;hewed

the Court had not yet got full evidence: Otherwi&s;e he would have been taken up, as well as others were.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Council ro&s;e, the King went to the Duche&s;s <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Monmouth</HI> and Others e&s;caped.</NOTE> of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s, and &s;eemed &s;o much concerned for the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> that he wept as he &s;poke to her. That Duke told a &s;trange pa&s;&s;age relating to that vi&s;it to the Lord <HI>Cutts,</HI> from whom I had it. The King told his Lady, that &s;ome were to come and &s;earch her lodgings: But he had given order that no &s;earch &s;hould be made in her apartments: So &s;he might conceal him &s;afely in them. But the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> added, that he knew him too well to tru&s;t him: So he went out of his lodgings. And it &s;eems he judged right: For the place that was fir&s;t &s;earched for him was her rooms: But he was gone. And he gave that for the rea&s;on why he could never tru&s;t the King after that. It is not likely the King meant to proceed to extremities with him, but that he intended to have him in his own hands, and in his power.</P>
<P>An order was &s;ent to bring up the Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> which met him coming up. He was brought before the Council, where he behaved him&s;elf with great pre&s;ence of mind. He was &s;ent to the Tower. But the gates were &s;hut: So he &s;taid in the me&s;&s;enger's hands all night, whom he furni&s;hed &s;o liberally with wine, that he was dead drunk. Next morning he went with him to the Tower gate, the me&s;&s;enger being again fa&s;t a&s;leep. He him&s;elf called at the Tower gate, to bring the Lieutenant of the Tower to receive a pri&s;oner. But he be|gan to think he might be in danger: He found <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> was one witne&s;s: And if another &s;hould come in he was gone: So he called for a pair of oars, and went away, leaving the drunken me&s;&s;enger fa&s;t a&s;leep. Warrants were &s;ent for &s;e|veral other per&s;ons: Some went out of the way, and others were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed after &s;ome months impri&s;onment. The King &s;hewed &s;ome appearance of &s;incerity in examining the wit|ne&s;&s;es: He told them, he would not have a growing evi|dence: And &s;o he charged them to tell out at once all that they knew: He led them into no accu&s;ations by a&s;king them any que&s;tions: He only a&s;ked them, if <HI>Oates</HI> was in their &s;e|cret: They an&s;wered, that they all looked on him as &s;uch a rogue, that they would not tru&s;t him. The King al&s;o &s;aid, he found Lord <HI>Howard</HI> was not among them, and he believ|ed that was upon the &s;ame account. There were many more per&s;ons named, and more particulars &s;et down in <HI>We&s;t</HI>'s nar|rative,
<PB N="550" REF="565">
than the Court thought fit to make u&s;e of: For they had no appearance of truth in them.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> from the time of his impri&s;onment looked upon him&s;elf as a dead man, and turned his thoughts whol|ly to another world. He read much in the Scriptures, par|ticularly in the P&s;alms, and read <HI>Baxter</HI>'s dying thoughts. He was as &s;erene and calm as if he had been in no danger at all. A Committee of Council came to examine him upon the de&s;ign of &s;eizing on the guards, and about his treating with the <HI>Scots.</HI> He an&s;wered them civilly; and &s;aid, that he was now preparing for his trial, where he did not doubt but he &s;hould an&s;wer every thing that could be objected to him. From him they went to <HI>Sidney,</HI> who treated them more roughly: He &s;aid, it &s;eemed they wanted evidence, and therefore they were come to draw it from his own mouth; but they &s;hould have nothing from him. Upon this exami|nation of Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> in which his treating with the <HI>Scots</HI> was &s;o po&s;itively charged on him, as a thing of which they were well a&s;&s;ured, his Lady de&s;ired me to &s;ee who this could be, that had &s;o charged him: But this appeared to be only an artifice, to draw a confe&s;&s;ion from him. <HI>Cochran</HI> was gone: And <HI>Baillie</HI> was a clo&s;e pri&s;oner, and was very ill u&s;ed: None were admitted to him. I &s;ent to the keeper of the pri&s;on to let him want for nothing, and that I &s;hould &s;ee him paid. I al&s;o at his de&s;ire &s;ent him books for his entertainment, for which I was threatned with a pri&s;on. I &s;aid, I was his neare&s;t kin&s;man in the place, and this was only to do as I would be done by. From what I found among the <HI>Scots</HI> I quieted the fears of Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s friends.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Howard</HI> was &s;till going about, and prote&s;ting to every per&s;on he &s;aw that there was no plot, and that he knew of none: Yet he &s;eemed to be under a con&s;ternation all the while. Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> told me, he was with him when the news was brought that <HI>We&s;t</HI> had delivered him&s;elf, upon which he &s;aw him change colour: And he a&s;ked him, if he apprehended any thing from him? He confe&s;&s;ed, he had been as free with him as with any man. <HI>Hamden</HI> &s;aw him afterwards under great fears: And upon that he wi&s;hed him to go out of the way, if he thought there was matter again&s;t him, and if he had not a &s;trength of mind to &s;uffer any thing that might happen to him. The King &s;poke of him with &s;uch contempt, that it was not probable that he was all this while in corre&s;pondence with the Court.</P>
<P><PB N="551" REF="566">
At la&s;t, four days before Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s trial, he was taken in his own hou&s;e after a long &s;earch; and was found &s;tand|ing up within a chimney. As &s;oon as he was taken he fell <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Howard</HI>'s confe&s;&s;ion.</NOTE> a crying: And at his fir&s;t examination he told, as he &s;aid, all that he knew. <HI>We&s;t</HI> and <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> had re&s;olved only to charge &s;ome of the lower &s;ort; but had not laid every thing &s;o well together, but that they were found contradicting one another. So <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> charged <HI>We&s;t</HI> for concealing &s;ome things: Upon which he was laid in irons, and was threat|ned with being hanged: For three days he would eat nothing, and &s;eemed re&s;olved to &s;tarve him&s;elf: But nature overcame his re&s;olutions: And then he told all he knew, and per|haps more than he knew; for I believe it was at this time that he wrote his narrative. And in that he told a new &s;tory of Lord <HI>Howard,</HI> which was not very credible, that he thought the be&s;t way of killing the King and the Duke, was for the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> to fall into <HI>New-Market</HI> with a body of three or four hundred hor&s;e when they were all a&s;leep, and &s;o to take them all: As if it had been an ea&s;y matter to get &s;uch a body together, and to carry them thi|ther invi&s;ibly upon &s;o de&s;perate a &s;ervice. Upon Lord <HI>How|ard</HI>'s examination, he told a long &s;tory of Lord <HI>Shaftsbury</HI>'s de&s;ign of rai&s;ing the City: He affirmed, that the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> had told him, how <HI>Trenchard</HI> had undertaken to bring a body of men from <HI>Taunton,</HI> but had failed in it: He confirmed that of a ri&s;ing intended in the City on the &s;eventeenth or the nineteenth of <HI>November</HI> la&s;t: But he knew of no body that was to be at the head of it. So this was looked on as only talk. But that which came more home was, that he owned there was a Council of &s;ix &s;ettled, of which he him&s;elf was one; and that they had had &s;everal debates among them concerning an in&s;urrection, and where it &s;hould begin, whether in the City or in the Country; but that they re&s;olved to be fir&s;t well informed concerning the &s;tate <HI>Scot|land</HI> was in; and that <HI>Sidney</HI> had &s;ent <HI>Aaron Smith</HI> to <HI>Scotland,</HI> to bring him a &s;ure information from thence, and that he gave him &s;ixty guineas for his journey: More of that mat|ter he did not know; for he had gone out of Town to the <HI>Bath,</HI> and to his e&s;tate in the Country. During his ab&s;ence the Lords began to apprehend their error in tru&s;ting him: And upon it Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;aid to Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> as the la&s;t told me in pri&s;on, that the putting them&s;elves in the power of &s;uch a man would be their reproach, as well as their ruin, for tru&s;ting a man of &s;o ill a character: So they re&s;olved to
<PB N="552" REF="567">
talk no more to him: But at his next coming to Town they told him, they &s;aw it was nece&s;&s;ary at pre&s;ent to give over all con&s;ultations, and to be quiet: And after that they &s;aw him very little. <HI>Hamden</HI> was upon Lord <HI>Howard</HI>'s di&s;covery &s;eized on: He, when examined, de&s;ired not to be pre&s;&s;ed with que&s;tions: So he was &s;ent to the Tower.</P>
<P>A party of hor&s;e was &s;ent to bring up Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was &s;ent to the Tower.</NOTE> had &s;taid all this while at his hou&s;e in the Country; and &s;eemed &s;o little apprehen&s;ive of danger, that his own Lady did not imagine he had any concern on his mind. He was offered to be conveyed away very &s;afely: But he would not &s;tir. His tenderne&s;s for Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> was the cau&s;e of this: For he thought his going out of the way might incline the Jury to believe the evidence the more for his ab&s;conding. He &s;eemed re&s;olved, as &s;oon as he &s;aw how that went, to take care of him&s;elf. When the party came to bring him up, he was at fir&s;t in &s;ome di&s;order, yet he recovered him|&s;elf. But when he came before the Council, he was in much confu&s;ion. He was &s;ent to the Tower: And there he fell under a great depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirit: He could not &s;leep at all. He had fallen before that twice under great fits of the &s;pleen, which returned now upon him with more violence. He &s;ent by a &s;ervant, whom he had long tru&s;ted, and who was &s;uffered to come to him, a very melancholy me&s;&s;age to his wife; That what he was charged with was true: He was &s;orry he had ruined her and her children: But he had &s;ent for the Earl of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> to talk freely to him, who had married his &s;i&s;ter. She immediately &s;ent back the &s;er|vant, to beg of him that he would not think of her or her children, but only &s;tudy to &s;upport his own &s;pirits; and de&s;ired him to &s;ay nothing to Lord <HI>Clarendon,</HI> nor to any body el&s;e, till &s;he &s;hould come to him, which &s;he was in hope to obtain leave to do in a day or two. Lord <HI>Claren|don</HI> came to him upon his me&s;&s;age: But he turned the mat|ter &s;o well to him, as if he had been only to explain &s;ome|what that he had mi&s;taken him&s;elf in when he was before the Council: But as to that for which he was clapt up, he &s;aid there was nothing in it, and it would appear how in|nocent he was. So Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> went away in a great mea|&s;ure &s;atisfied, as he him&s;elf told me. His Lady had another me&s;&s;age from him, that he was much calmer; e&s;pecially when he found how &s;he took his condition to heart, with|out &s;eeming concerned for her own &s;hare in it. He ordered many things to be &s;ent to him: And among other things he
<PB N="553" REF="568">
called at &s;everal times for a penknife, with which he u&s;ed to pare his nails very nicely: So this was thought intended for an amu&s;ement. But it was not brought from his hou&s;e in the Country, tho' &s;ent for. And when it did not come, he called for a razor, and &s;aid, that would do as well. The King and the Duke came to the Tower that morning, as was given out, to &s;ee &s;ome invention about the ordinance. As they were going into their barge, the cry came after them of what had hapned to Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex:</HI> For his man, thinking he &s;taid longer than ordinary in his clo&s;et, &s;aid, he looked thro' the key hole, and there &s;aw him lying dead: Upon which the door being broke open, he was found dead; his throat cut, &s;o that both the jugulars and the gullet were cut, a little above the <HI>A&s;pera Arteria.</HI> I &s;hall afterwards give an account of the further enquiry into this matter, which pa&s;t then univer&s;ally as done by him&s;elf. The Co|roners Jury found it &s;elf-murder. And when his body was brought home to his own hou&s;e, and the wound was examin|ed by his own Surgeon, he &s;aid to me, it was impo&s;&s;ible the wound could be as it was, if given by any hand but his own: For except he had ca&s;t his head back, and &s;tretched up his neck all he could, the <HI>A&s;pera Arteria</HI> mu&s;t have been cut. But to go on with this tragical day, in which I lo&s;t the two be&s;t friends I had in the world:</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s trial was fixed for that day. A Jury <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s trial.</NOTE> was returned that con&s;i&s;ted of citizens of <HI>London</HI> who were not freeholders. So the fir&s;t point argued in law was, whether this could be a legal Jury. The &s;tatute was expre&s;s: And the rea&s;on was, that none but men of certain e&s;tates might try a man upon his life. It was an&s;wered, that the practice of the City was to the contrary, upon the very rea&s;on of the law: For the riche&s;t men of the City were often no freeholders, but merchants who&s;e wealth lay in their trade and &s;tock. So this was over-ruled, and the Jury was &s;worn. They were pickt out with great care, being men of fair re|putation in other re&s;pects, but &s;o engaged in the party for the Court, that they were ea&s;y to believe any thing on that &s;ide. <HI>Rum&s;ey, Shepherd,</HI> and Lord <HI>Howard</HI> were the wit|ne&s;&s;es, who depo&s;ed according to what was formerly related. <HI>Shepherd</HI> &s;wore, Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> was twice at his hou&s;e, tho' he was never there but once. And when Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> &s;ent him word after his &s;entence, that he forgave him all he had &s;worn again&s;t him, but that he mu&s;t remember that he was never within his doors but one &s;ingle time: To which all the
<PB N="554" REF="569">
an&s;wer <HI>Shepherd</HI> made was, that all the while he was in Court during the trial he was under &s;uch a confu&s;ion, that he &s;carce knew what he &s;aid. Both <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> and he &s;wore, that Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> had expre&s;&s;ed his con&s;ent to the &s;eizing on the guards, tho' they did not &s;wear any one word that he &s;poke which imported it: So that here a man was convicted of trea|&s;on, for being pre&s;ent by accident, or for &s;ome innocent pur|po&s;e, where trea&s;onable matter was di&s;cour&s;ed, without bear|ing a part in that di&s;cour&s;e, or giving any a&s;&s;ent by words or otherwi&s;e to what was &s;o di&s;cour&s;ed; which at the mo&s;t amounts to mi&s;-pri&s;ion, or concealment of trea&s;on only. As Lord <HI>Howard</HI> began his evidence, the news of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s death came to the Court. Upon which Lord <HI>Howard</HI> &s;topped, and &s;aid, he could not go on till he gave vent to his grief in &s;ome tears. He &s;oon recovered him&s;elf, and told all his &s;tory. Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> defended him&s;elf by many com|purgators, who &s;poke very fully of his great worth, and that it was not likely he would engage in ill de&s;igns. Some others be&s;ides my &s;elf te&s;tified, how &s;olemnly Lord <HI>Howard</HI> had denied his knowledge of any plot upon its fir&s;t break|ing out. <HI>Finch,</HI> the Solicitor General, &s;aid, no regard was to be had to that, for all witne&s;&s;es denied at fir&s;t. It was an&s;wered, if the&s;e denials had been only to a magi&s;trate, or at an examination, it might be thought of le&s;s moment: But &s;uch &s;olemn denials, with a&s;&s;everations, to friends, and officiou&s;ly offered, &s;hewed that &s;uch a witne&s;s was &s;o bad a man, that no credit was due to his te&s;timony. It was al&s;o urged, that it was not &s;worn by any of the witne&s;&s;es, that Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> had &s;poken any &s;uch words, or words to that effect: And without &s;ome &s;uch indication, it could not be known that he hearkned to the di&s;cour&s;e, or con&s;ented to it. Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> al&s;o a&s;ked, upon what &s;tatute he was tried: If upon the old &s;tatute of the twenty fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, or if upon the &s;tatute made declaring what &s;hall be held trea&s;on during the King's reign? They could not rely on the la&s;t, becau&s;e of the limitation of time in it: Six months, and &s;omething more, were pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the time of the&s;e di&s;|cour&s;es: So they relied on the old &s;tatute. Upon which he a&s;ked, where was the overt-act? For none appeared. It was al&s;o &s;aid, that by that &s;tatute the very imagining the King's death, when proved by an overt-act, was trea&s;on: But it was only the levying war, and not the imagining to levy war again&s;t the King, that was trea&s;on by that &s;tatute. <HI>Cook</HI> and <HI>Hale</HI> were of this opinion, and gave their rea&s;ons for it. And
<PB N="555" REF="570">
it &s;eemed, that the Parliament that pa&s;t the act of trea&s;on during the pre&s;ent Reign were of that mind; for they enu|merated con&s;ultations to rai&s;e war among tho&s;e things which were declared to be trea&s;on during that Reign: This &s;hew|ed, that they did not look on them as comprehended with|in the old &s;tatute. The King's Coun&s;el pretended, that con|&s;ultations to &s;eize on the guards were an overt-act of a de&s;ign again&s;t the King's per&s;on. But tho&s;e forces, that have got the de&s;ignation of guards appropriated to them, are not the King's guards in law: They are not &s;o much as allowed of by law: For even the lately di&s;&s;olved long Parliament, that was &s;o careful of the King, and &s;o kind to him, would never take notice of the King's forces, much le&s;s call them his guards. The guards were only a company of men in the King's pay: So that a de&s;ign to &s;eize on them amounted to no more, than to a de&s;ign to &s;eize on a part of the King's army. But the word guards &s;ounded &s;o like a &s;ecurity to the King's per&s;on, that the de&s;ign again&s;t them was con&s;tructed a de&s;ign again&s;t his life: And yet none of the witne&s;&s;es &s;poke of any de&s;ign again&s;t the King's per&s;on. Lord <HI>Howard</HI> &s;wore po|&s;itively, that they had no &s;uch de&s;ign. Yet the one was con|&s;tructed to be the natural con&s;equence of the other. So that after all the declaiming again&s;t a con&s;tructive trea&s;on in the ca&s;e of Lord <HI>Strafford,</HI> the Court was always running into it, when they had a mind to de&s;troy any that &s;tood in their way. Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> de&s;ired, that his Coun&s;el might be heard to this point of &s;eizing the guards: But that was denied, unle&s;s he would confe&s;s the fact: And he would not do that, becau&s;e, as the witne&s;&s;es had &s;worn it, it was fal&s;e. He once intend|ed to have related the whole fact, ju&s;t as it was: But his Coun&s;el advi&s;ed him again&s;t it. Some of his friends were for it, who thought that it could amount to no more than a concealment and mi&s;-pri&s;ion of trea&s;on. Yet the Coun&s;el di&s;tingui&s;hed between a bare knowledge, and a concealing that, and a joining de&s;ignedly in council with men that did de&s;ign trea&s;on: For in that ca&s;e, tho' a man &s;hould dif|fer in opinion from a trea&s;onable propo&s;ition, yet his mix|ing in council with &s;uch men will in law make him a trai|tor. Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> &s;poke but little: Yet in few words he touched on all the material points of law that had been &s;ug|ge&s;ted to him. <HI>Finch</HI> &s;ummed up the evidence again&s;t him: But in that, and in &s;everal other trials afterwards, he &s;hew|ed more of a vicious eloquence, in turning matters with &s;ome &s;ubtlery again&s;t the pri&s;oners, than of &s;olid or &s;incere rea|&s;oning.
<PB N="556" REF="571">
<HI>Jefferies</HI> would &s;hew his zeal, and &s;peak after him: But it was only an in&s;olent declamation, &s;uch as all his were, full of fury and indecent invectives. <HI>Pemberton</HI> was the head of the Court, the other Bench not being yet filled. He &s;ummed up the evidence at fir&s;t very fairly: But in conclu&s;ion he told the Jury, that a de&s;ign to &s;eize the guards was &s;ure|ly a de&s;ign again&s;t the King's life. But tho' he &s;truck upon this, which was the main point, yet it was thought that his &s;tating the whole matter with &s;o little eagerne&s;s again&s;t Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> was that which lo&s;t him his place: For he was turned out &s;oon after. Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s behaviour during the trial was decent and compo&s;ed: So that he &s;eem|ed very little concerned in the i&s;&s;ue of the matter. He was a man of &s;o much candour, that he &s;poke little as to the fact: For &s;ince he was advi&s;ed not to tell the whole truth, he could not &s;peak again&s;t that which he knew to be true, tho' in &s;ome particulars it had been carried beyond the truth. But he was not allowed to make the difference: So he left that wholly to the Jury, who brought in their verdict <NOTE PLACE="marg">He was con|demned.</NOTE> again&s;t him, upon which he received &s;entence.</P>
<P>He then compo&s;ed him&s;elf to die with great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. He &s;aid, he was &s;ure the day of his trial was more unea&s;y to him, than that of his execution would be. All po&s;&s;ible methods were u&s;ed to have &s;aved his life: Money was offered to the Lady <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and to all that had credit, and that with|out mea&s;ure. He was pre&s;&s;ed to &s;end petitions and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ions to the King, and to the Duke: But he left it to his friends to con&s;ider how far the&s;e might go, and how they were to be worded. All he was brought to was, to offer to live beyond &s;ea in any place that the King &s;hould name, and never to meddle any more in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> affairs. But all was in vain: Both King and Duke were fixed in their re&s;o|lutions; but with this difference, as Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> afterwards told me, that the Duke &s;uffered &s;ome, among whom he was one, to argue the point with him, but the King could not bear the di&s;cour&s;e. Some have &s;aid, that the Duke moved that he might be executed in <HI>Southampton</HI> &s;quare before his own hou&s;e, but that the King rejected that as indecent. So <HI>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</HI> was the place appointed for his execution. The la&s;t week of his life he was &s;hut up all the mornings, as he him&s;elf de&s;ired. And about noon I came to him, and &s;taid with him till night. All the while he expre&s;&s;ed a very Chri&s;tian temper, without &s;harpne&s;s or re&s;entment, vanity or affectation. His whole behaviour looked like a triumph over
<PB N="557" REF="572">
death. Upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, as at table, or when his friends came to &s;ee him, he was decently cheerful. I was by him when the Sheriffs came to &s;hew him the warrant for his exe|cution. He read it with indifference: And when they were gone he told me, it was not decent to be merry with &s;uch a matter, otherwi&s;e he was near telling <HI>Rich,</HI> (who tho' he was now of the other &s;ide, yet had been a member of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and had voted for the Exclu&s;ion,) that they &s;hould never &s;it together in that Hou&s;e any more to vote for the bill of Exclu&s;ion. The day before his death he fell a bleeding at the no&s;e: Upon that he &s;aid to me plea&s;antly, I &s;hall not now let blood to divert this: That will be done to morrow. At night it rained hard: And he &s;aid, &s;uch a rain to morrow will &s;poil a great &s;hew, which was a dull thing in a rainy day. He &s;aid, the &s;ins of his youth lay heavy upon his mind: But he hoped God had forgiven them, for he was &s;ure he had for&s;aken them, and for many years he had walked before God with a &s;incere heart: If in his pub|lick actings he had committed errors, they were only the errors of his under&s;tanding; for he had no private ends, nor ill de&s;igns of his own in them: He was &s;till of opinion that the King was limited by law, and that when he broke thro' tho&s;e limits his &s;ubjects might defend them&s;elves, and re&s;train him: He thought a violent death was a very de|&s;irable way of ending one's life: It was only the being ex|po&s;ed to be a little gazed at, and to &s;uffer the pain of one minute, which, he was confident, was not equal to the pain of drawing a tooth. He &s;aid, he felt none of tho&s;e tran&s;ports that &s;ome good people felt; but he had a full calm in his mind, no palpitation at heart, nor trembling at the thoughts of death. He was much concerned at the cloud that &s;eemed to be now over his Country: But he hoped his death &s;hould do more &s;ervice, than his life could have done.</P>
<P>This was the &s;ub&s;tance of the di&s;cour&s;e between him and <NOTE PLACE="marg">His prepara|tion for death.</NOTE> me. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> was oft with him that la&s;t week. We thought the party had gone too quick in their con&s;ultations, and too far; and that re&s;i&s;tance in the condition we were then in was not lawful. He &s;aid, he had not lei&s;ure to enter into di&s;cour&s;es of politicks; but he thought a government limited by law was only a name, if the &s;ubjects might not maintain tho&s;e limitations by force: Otherwi&s;e all was at the di&s;cretion of the Prince: That was contrary to all the notions he had lived in of our government. But he &s;aid, there was nothing among them but the embrio's of things, that were never like to
<PB N="558" REF="573">
have any effect, and that were now quite di&s;&s;olved. He thought, it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to leave a paper behind him at his death: And becau&s;e he had not been accu&s;tomed to draw &s;uch papers, he de&s;ired me to give him a &s;cheme of the heads fit to be &s;poken to, and of the order in which they &s;hould be laid: Which I did. And he was three days employed for &s;ome time in the morning to write out his &s;peech. He ordered four copies to be made of it, all which he &s;igned; and gave the original with three of the copies to his Lady, and kept the other to give to the Sheriffs on the Scaffold. He writ it with great care: And the pa&s;&s;ages that were tender he writ in papers apart, and &s;hewed them to his Lady, and to my &s;elf, before he writ them out fair. He was very ea&s;y when this was ended. He al&s;o writ a letter to the King, in which he a&s;ked pardon for every thing he had &s;aid or done contrary to his duty, prote&s;ting he was inno|cent as to all de&s;igns again&s;t his per&s;on or government, and that his heart was ever devoted to that which he thought was his true intere&s;t. He added, that tho' he thought he had met with hard mea&s;ure, yet he forgave all concerned in it from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t; and ended, hoping that his Maje&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure at him would cea&s;e with his own life, and that no part of it &s;hould fall on his wife and children. The day before his death he received the Sacra|ment from <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> with much devotion. And I preached two &s;hort &s;ermons to him, which he heard with great af|fection. And we were &s;hut up till towards the evening. Then he &s;uffered his children that were very young, and &s;ome few of his friends to take leave of him; in which he main|tained his con&s;tancy of temper, tho' he was a very fond father. He al&s;o parted with his Lady with a compo&s;ed &s;ilence: And, as &s;oon as &s;he was gone, he &s;aid to me, The bitterne&s;s of death is pa&s;t: For he loved and e&s;teemed her beyond expre&s;&s;ion, as &s;he well de&s;erved it in all re&s;pects. She had the command of her &s;elf &s;o much, that at parting &s;he gave him no di&s;turbance. He went into his chamber about midnight: And I &s;taid all night in the outward room. He went not to bed till about two in the morning: And was fa&s;t a&s;leep at four, when according to his order we called him. He was quickly dre&s;&s;ed, but would lo&s;e no time in &s;having: For he &s;aid, he was not concerned in his good looks that day.</P>
<P>He was not ill plea&s;ed with the account he heard that <NOTE PLACE="marg">The trial and execu|tion of <HI>Wal|cot</HI> and o|thers.</NOTE> morning of the manner of <HI>Walcot</HI>'s death, who together with

The&s;e were condemned upon the evidence of the witne&s;&s;es. <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> and <HI>We&s;t</HI> &s;wore fully again&s;t <HI>Walcot:</HI> He had al&s;o writ a letter to the Secretary offering to make di&s;coveries, in which he &s;aid the plot was laid deep and wide. <HI>Walcot</HI> denied at his death the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Rye-Plot,</HI> and of his under|taking to fight the guards while others &s;hould kill the King. He &s;aid; <HI>We&s;t</HI> had often &s;poken of it to him in the phra&s;e of <HI>lopping;</HI> and that he always &s;aid he would not meddle in it, and that he looked on it as an infamous thing, and as that which the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> would certainly revenge, tho' <HI>We&s;t</HI> a&s;&s;ured him that Duke had engaged un|der his hand to con&s;ent to it. This confe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Walcot</HI>'s, as it &s;hewed him&s;elf very guilty, &s;o it made <HI>We&s;t</HI> appear &s;o black, that the Court made no more u&s;e of him. <HI>Hone,</HI> a poor trade&s;man in <HI>London,</HI> who it &s;eems had &s;ome heat but &s;carce any &s;en&s;e in him, was drawn in by <HI>Keeling,</HI> and <HI>Lee,</HI> another witne&s;s, who was al&s;o brought in by <HI>Keeling</HI> to a very wild thing, of killing the King but &s;paring the Duke, upon this conceit, that we would be in le&s;s danger in being under a profe&s;&s;ed Papi&s;t than under the King. <HI>Hone</HI> had promi&s;ed to &s;erve in the execution of it, but neither knew when, where, nor how it was to be done: So, tho' he &s;eemed fitter for a <HI>Bedlam</HI> than a trial, yet he was tried the day before the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> and &s;uffered with the others the day before him. He confe&s;&s;ed his own guilt; but &s;aid, the&s;e who witne&s;&s;ed again&s;t him had engaged him in that de&s;ign, for which they now charged him: But he knew nothing of any other per&s;ons, be&s;ides him&s;elf and the two witne&s;&s;es. The third was one <HI>Row&s;e,</HI> who had belonged to <HI>Player</HI> the Chamberlain of <HI>London;</HI> again&s;t whom <HI>Lee</HI> and <HI>Keeling</HI> &s;wore the &s;ame things. He was more affected with a &s;en&s;e of the heat and fury with which he had been acted, than the others were: But he denied, that he was ever in any de&s;ign again&s;t the King's life. He &s;aid, the witne&s;&s;es had let fall many wicked things of that matter in di&s;cour&s;e with him: So that he was re&s;olved to di&s;cover them, and was only waiting till he could find out the bottom of their de&s;igns: But that now they had prevented him. He vindicated all his acquain|tance from being any way concerned in the matter, or from approving &s;uch de&s;igns. The&s;e men dying as they did, was &s;uch a di&s;grace to the witne&s;&s;es, that the Court &s;aw it was not fit to make any further u&s;e of them. Great u&s;e was made of the conjunction of the&s;e two plots, one for a ri&s;ing,
<PB N="560" REF="575">
and another for an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. It was &s;aid, that the one was that which gave the heart and hope to the other black con&s;piracy: By which they were over all <HI>England</HI> blended to|gether as a plot within a plot, which ca&s;t a great load on the whole party.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> &s;eemed to have &s;ome &s;atisfaction to find that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ru&s;&s;el's</HI> exe|cution.</NOTE> there was no truth in the whole contrivance of the <HI>Rye-Plot:</HI> So that he hoped, that infamy, which now bla&s;ted their party, would &s;oon go off. He went into his chamber &s;ix or &s;even times in the morning, and prayed by him&s;elf, and then came out to <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> and me: He drunk a little tea and &s;ome &s;herry. He wound up his watch; and &s;aid, now he had done with time, and was going to eternity. He a&s;ked what he &s;hould give the executioner: I told him ten guineas: He &s;aid, with a &s;mile, it was a pretty thing to give a fee to have his head cut off. When the Sheriffs called him about ten a clock, Lord <HI>Cavendi&s;h</HI> was waiting below to take leave of him. They embraced very tenderly. Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> after he had left him, upon a &s;udden thought came back to him, and pre&s;&s;ed him earne&s;tly to apply him&s;elf more to Religion; and told him what great comfort and &s;upport he felt from it now in his extremity. Lord <HI>Cavendi&s;h</HI> had very generou&s;ly offered to manage his e&s;cape, and to &s;tay in pri&s;on for him while he &s;hould go away in his cloaths: But he would not hearken to the motion. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> had al&s;o &s;ent me word, to let him know, that, if he thought it could do him any &s;ervice, he would come in, and run fortunes with him. He an&s;wered, it would be of no advantage to him to have his friends die with him. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> and I went in the coach with him to the place of execution. Some of the croud that filled the &s;treets wept, while others in&s;ulted: He was touched with the tenderne&s;s that the one gave him, but did not &s;eem at all provoked by the other. He was &s;ing|ing P&s;alms a great part of the way; and &s;aid, he hoped to &s;ing better very &s;oon. As he ob&s;erved the great crouds of people all the way, he &s;aid to us, I hope I &s;hall quickly &s;ee a much better a&s;&s;embly. When he came to the Scaffold, he walk|ed about it four or five times. Then he turned to the She|riffs, and delivered his paper. He prote&s;ted, he had always been far from any de&s;igns again&s;t the King's life or govern|ment: He prayed God would pre&s;erve both, and the Pro|te&s;tant Religion. He wi&s;hed all Prote&s;tants might love one another, and not make way for Popery by their animo|&s;ities.</P>
<P><PB N="561" REF="576">
The &s;ub&s;tance of the paper he gave them was, fir&s;t a pro|fe&s;&s;ion of his Religion, and of his &s;incerity in it: That he was of the Church of <HI>England:</HI> But wi&s;hed all would unite to|gether <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ru&s;&s;el's</HI> la&s;t &s;peech.</NOTE> again&s;t the common enemy: That Churchmen would be le&s;s &s;evere, and Di&s;&s;enters le&s;s &s;crupulous. He owned, he had a great zeal again&s;t Popery, which he looked on as an idolatrous and bloody Religion: But that, tho' he was at all times ready to venture his life for his Religion or his Coun|try, yet that would never have carried him to a black or wicked de&s;ign. No man ever had the impudence to move to him any thing with relation to the King's life: He prayed heartily for him, that in his per&s;on and govern|ment he might be happy, both in this world and in the next. He prote&s;ted, that in the pro&s;ecution of the Popi&s;h plot he had gone on in the &s;incerity of his heart; and that he never knew of any practice with the witne&s;&s;es. He own|ed, he had been earne&s;t in the matter of the Exclu&s;ion, as the be&s;t way in his opinion to &s;ecure both the King's life and the Prote&s;tant religion: And to that he imputed his pre&s;ent &s;ufferings: But he forgave all concerned in them; and charged his friends to think of no revenges. He thought his &s;entence was hard: Upon which he gave an account of all that had pa&s;t at <HI>Shepherd's.</HI> From the heats that were in choo&s;ing the Sheriffs he concluded, that matter would end as it now did: And he was not much &s;urprized to find it fall upon him&s;elf: He wi&s;hed it might end in him: Kill|ing by forms of law was the wor&s;t &s;ort of murder. He con|cluded with &s;ome very devout Ejaculations. After he had delivered this paper he prayed by him&s;elf: Then <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> prayed with him. After that he prayed again by him&s;elf: And then undre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, and laid his head on the block, without the lea&s;t change of countenance: And it was cut off at two &s;trokes.</P>
<P>This was the end of that great and good man: On which I have perhaps enlarged too copiou&s;ly: But the great e&s;teem I had for him, and the &s;hare I had in this matter, will I hope excu&s;e it. His &s;peech was &s;o &s;oon printed, that it was &s;elling about the &s;treets an hour after his death: Upon which the Court was highly enflamed. So <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> and I were ap|pointed to appear before the Cabinet Council. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> had little to &s;ay, but only that Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> had &s;hewed him his &s;peech the day before he &s;uffered; and that he &s;poke to him, what he thought was incumbent on him, upon &s;ome parts of it, but he was not di&s;po&s;ed to alter it. I was longer before

them. I &s;aw they apprehended I had penned the &s;peech. I told the King, that at his Lady's de&s;ire I writ down a very particular journal of every pa&s;&s;age, great and &s;mall, that had hapned during my attendance on him: I had ju&s;t end|ed it, as I received my &s;ummons to attend his Maje&s;ty: So, if he commanded me, I would read it to him: Which upon his command I did. I &s;aw they were all a&s;toni&s;hed at the many extraordinary things in it: The mo&s;t important of them are &s;et down in the former relation. The Lord Keeper a&s;ked me, if I intended to print that. I &s;aid, it was only inten|ded for his Lady's private u&s;e. The Lord Keeper, &s;eeing the King &s;ilent, added, You are not to think the King is plea&s;ed with this, becau&s;e he &s;ays nothing. This was very mean. He then a&s;ked me, if I had not &s;tudied to di&s;&s;uade the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> from putting many things in his &s;peech. I &s;aid, I had di&s;charged my con&s;cience to him very freely in every particular: But he was now gone: So it was impo&s;|&s;ible to know, if I &s;hould tell any thing of what had pa&s;t between us, whether it was true or fal&s;e: I de&s;ired therefore to be excu&s;ed. The Duke a&s;ked me, if he had &s;aid any thing to me in confe&s;&s;ion. I an&s;wered, that if he had &s;aid any thing to me in confidence, that was enough to re&s;train me from &s;peaking of it. Only I offered to take my oath, that the &s;peech was penned by him&s;elf, and not by me. The Duke, upon all that pa&s;t in this examination, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o highly offended at me, that it was concluded I would be ruined. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> &s;ent me word, that the Duke looked on my reading the journal as a &s;tudied thing, to make a panegyrick on Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el's</HI> memory. Many pamphlets were writ on that occa&s;ion: And I was heavily charged in them all, as the advi&s;er, if not the author, of the &s;peech. But I was advi&s;ed by all my friends to write no an&s;wer, but to bear the malice that was vented upon me with &s;ilence; which I re&s;olved to do.</P>
<P>At this time Prince <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Denmark</HI> came into <HI>Eng|land</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince <HI>George</HI> of <HI>Denmark</HI> married the Prince&s;s <HI>Anne.</HI></NOTE> to marry the Duke's &s;econd daughter. The Prince of <HI>Hanover</HI> had come over two years before to make addre&s;&s;es to her: But he was &s;carce got hither, when he received orders from his father not to proceed in that de&s;ign; for he had agreed a match for him with his brother the Duke of <HI>Zell</HI> for his daughter, which did at that time more ac|commodate the family. The marriage that was now made with the brother of <HI>Denmark</HI> did not at all plea&s;e the nati|on: For we knew that the propo&s;ition came from <HI>France.</HI>
<PB N="563" REF="578">
So it was apprehended, that both Courts reckoned they were &s;ure that he would change his Religion: In which we have &s;een, &s;ince that time, that our fears were ill grounded. He has lived in all re&s;pects the happie&s;t with his Prince&s;s that was po&s;&s;ible, except in one particular: For tho' there was a child born every year for many years, yet they have all died: So that the fruitfulle&s;t marriage that has been known in our age, has been fatally bla&s;ted as to the effect of it.</P>
<P>The affairs abroad were now every where in a great fer|mentation. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;iege of <HI>Vienna.</HI></NOTE> The Emperor had governed <HI>Hungary</HI> &s;o &s;trange|ly, as at once to per&s;ecute the Prote&s;tants and to oppre&s;s the Papi&s;ts in their liberties, which di&s;po&s;ed both to rebel: Upon which the male-contents were now in arms, and had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of &s;everal places in the upper <HI>Hungary;</HI> which being near <HI>Poland,</HI> they were managed and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ters in that Kingdom; in which the Car|dinal of <HI>Fourbin</HI> was the chief in&s;trument. But they not be|ing able to maintain them&s;elves again&s;t the Emperor's whole force, <HI>Tekeli,</HI> who was &s;et at their head, offered all &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ions to the <HI>Turk,</HI> and begged his protection. Upon this that great was broke out, all &s;et on by the practices of the King of <HI>France;</HI> who, while he was per&s;ecuting the Prote&s;|tants in his own Kingdom, was at the &s;ame time encourag|ing the rebellion of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and drawing the <HI>Turk</HI> into Chri&s;tendom. I need not enlarge further on a matter &s;o well known as the &s;iege of <HI>Vienna:</HI> Which, if it had been as well pro&s;ecuted as it was fir&s;t undertaken, the Town would have been certainly taken, and with that the Emperor and his family ruined. The King of <HI>France</HI> drew a great army together near the frontier of <HI>Germany,</HI> and &s;eemed to de|pend upon it that the Town would be taken; and that he would be called in by the Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> to protect them, and upon that have been cho&s;en Emperor. He at the &s;ame time &s;ent <HI>Humieres</HI> with an army into <HI>Flanders,</HI> up|on a preten&s;ion to <HI>Alo&s;t,</HI> that would have &s;eemed very &s;trange in any other Court but that. he had once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, during the war, of <HI>Alo&s;t:</HI> But afterwards he drew his troops out of it. So it not being in his hands when the peace of <HI>Nimeguen</HI> was made, no mention was made of re&s;toring it. But now it was &s;aid, that, it being once in the King's hands by the right of his arms, it was &s;till his, &s;ince he had not expre&s;&s;ly renounced it: Therefore he now de|manded it, or to have <HI>Luxembourg</HI> given him as an equiva|lent
<PB N="564" REF="579">
for it. <HI>Humieres</HI> finding no re&s;i&s;tance in the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands,</HI> de&s;troyed and ruined the country, beyond any thing it had felt during the whole war. This was the &s;tate of affairs abroad at the time of the&s;e trials.</P>
<P>All people thought we &s;hould &s;ee a Parliament pre&s;ently called, from which both the King and the Duke might have expected every thing that they could de&s;ire: For the body of the nation was yet &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the belief of the plot, that probably all elections would have gone as the Court di|rected, and &s;carce any of the other party would have had the courage to have &s;tood for an election any where. But the King of <HI>France</HI> began to apprehend, that the King might grow &s;o much the ma&s;ter at home, that he would be no longer in their management: And they fore&s;aw that, what &s;ucce&s;s &s;oever the King might have in a Parliament with relation to his own affairs, it was not to be imagined but that a Hou&s;e of Commons, at the &s;ame time that they &s;hewed their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the King, would both enable him to re&s;i&s;t the progre&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> arms, and addre&s;s to him to enter into alliances with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the States. So the <HI>French</HI> made u&s;e of all their in&s;truments to divert our Court from calling a Parliament: And they got the King to con&s;ent to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of <HI>Luxembourg:</HI> For which, I was told, they gave him 300000 <HI>l.</HI> But I have no certainty of that. Lord <HI>Mountague</HI> told me of it, and &s;eem|ed to believe it: And Lady <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> valued her &s;elf on this of <HI>Luxembourg</HI> as gained by her; and called it the la&s;t &s;ervice &s;he did the Court of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>At this time I went over into <HI>France,</HI> chiefly to be out <NOTE PLACE="marg">The author went to the Court of <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> of the way, when I was fallen on almo&s;t in every libel: For new &s;ets of addre&s;&s;es were now running about the nation, with more heat and &s;welled eloquence in them than the for|mer ones. In all which the providential fire of <HI>New-Market</HI> was &s;et off with great pomp: And in many of them there were hard things &s;aid of Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> and his &s;peech, with in&s;inuations that looked towards me.</P>
<P>In <HI>France Rouvigny,</HI> who was the Lady <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s uncle, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Characters of &s;ome he knew there.</NOTE> &s;tudied to get me to be much vi&s;ited and known. There my acquaintance with Mar&s;hal <HI>Schomberg</HI> began: And by him I was acquainted with Mar&s;hal <HI>Bellfonds,</HI> who was a de|vout man, but very weak. He read the Scriptures much, and &s;eemed to practi&s;e the vertues of the de&s;ert in the mid&s;t of that Court. I knew the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Rheims,</HI> who was a rough boi&s;terous man: He &s;eemed to have good notions of
<PB N="565" REF="580">
the epi&s;copal duty, in all things except that of the &s;etting a good example to his Clergy: For he allowed him&s;elf in liberties of all kinds. The Duke of <HI>Montau&s;ier</HI> was a pattern of vertue and &s;incerity, if not too cynical in it. He was &s;o far from flattering the King, as all the re&s;t did mo&s;t ab|jectly, that he could not hold from contradicting him, as often as there was occa&s;ion for it. And for that rea&s;on chief|ly the King made him the <HI>Dauphin</HI>'s governor: To which, he told me, he had applied him&s;elf with great care, tho', he very frankly added, without &s;ucce&s;s. The exterior of the King was very &s;olemn: The fir&s;t time I hapned to &s;ee him was, when the news came of the rai&s;ing the &s;iege of <HI>Vienna;</HI> with which, <HI>Schomberg</HI> told me, he was much &s;truck, for he did not look for it. While I was at Court, which was only for four or five days, one of the King's coaches was &s;ent to wait on me, and the King ordered me to be well treated by all about him, which upon that was done with a great profu&s;ion of extraordinary re&s;pects: At which all people &s;tood amazed. Some thought, it was to encourage the &s;ide again&s;t the Court by this treatment of one then in di&s;grace. Others more probably thought, that the King, hearing I was a writer of hi&s;tory, had a mind to engage me to write on his &s;ide. I was told a pen&s;ion would be offered me. But I made no &s;teps towards it: For tho' I was offer|ed an audience of the King, I excu&s;ed it, &s;ince I could not have the honour to be pre&s;ented to that King by the Mini&s;ter of <HI>England.</HI> I &s;aw the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> but once, tho' he intended to &s;ee me oftner. He had a great quickne&s;s of ap|prehen&s;ion, and was thought the be&s;t judge in <HI>France</HI> both of wit and learning. He had read my hi&s;tory of the Refor|mation, that was then tran&s;lated into <HI>French,</HI> and &s;eemed plea&s;ed with it. So were many of the great lawyers; in par|ticular <HI>Harlay,</HI> then Attorney General, and now fir&s;t Pre&s;i|dent of the Court of Parliament of <HI>Paris.</HI> The conte&s;ts with <HI>Rome</HI> were then very high; for the A&s;&s;embly of the Clergy had pa&s;t &s;ome articles very derogatory to the Pa|pal authority: So many fancied, that matter might go to a rupture: And <HI>Harlay</HI> &s;aid very publickly, that, if that &s;hould happen, I had laid before them a good plan to copy from.</P>
<P><HI>Bellefonds</HI> had &s;o good an opinion of me, that he thought in&s;tances of devotion might have &s;ome effect on me: So he made the Duche&s;s <HI>La Valiere</HI> think, that &s;he might be an in&s;trument in converting me: And he brought a me&s;&s;age from
<PB N="566" REF="581">
her, de&s;iring me to come to the grate to her. I was twice there: And &s;he told me the &s;teps of her conver&s;ion, and of her coming into that &s;trict order of the <HI>Carmelites,</HI> with great humility and much devotion. <HI>Treville,</HI> one of the Duche&s;s of <HI>Orleans's</HI> admirers, was &s;o &s;truck with her death, that he had lived in retreat from that time, and was but newly come to appear again: He had great knowledge, with a true &s;en&s;e of Religion: He &s;eemed to groan under many of the corruptions of their Church. He and &s;ome others whom I knew of the <HI>Sorbon,</HI> chiefly <HI>Faur, Pique,</HI> and <HI>Brayer,</HI> &s;eemed to think that almo&s;t every thing among them was out of order; and wi&s;hed for a regular Reformation: But their notion of the unity of the Church kept them &s;till in a communion that they &s;eemed unea&s;y in: And they &s;aid very freely, they wondered how any one that was once out of their communion &s;hould de&s;ire to come back into it. They were generally learned only in one point: <HI>Faur</HI> was the be&s;t read in eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory of any man I &s;aw among them: And I never knew any of that Church that under&s;tood the Scriptures &s;o well as <HI>Pique</HI> did. They declared them&s;elves for aboli&s;hing the Papal authority, and for reducing the Pope to the old Primacy again. They &s;poke to me of the Bi&s;hops of <HI>France,</HI> as men that were both vitious and ignorant: They &s;eemed now to be again&s;t the Pope: But it was only be|cau&s;e he was in the intere&s;ts of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria:</HI> For they would declare him infallible the next day after he &s;hould turn to the intere&s;t of <HI>France:</HI> So they expected no good, neither from the Court nor from the Clergy. I &s;aw St. <HI>Amour,</HI> the author of the journal of what pa&s;t at <HI>Rome</HI> in the con|demnation of the five propo&s;itions of <HI>Jan&s;enius.</HI> He &s;eemed to be a &s;incere and worthy man, who had more judgment than either quickne&s;s or learning. He told me, his whole life had been one campaign again&s;t the <HI>Je&s;uits;</HI> and &s;poke of them as the great plague of the Church. He lamented al&s;o that &s;harpne&s;s of &s;tile with which his friend <HI>Arnauld</HI> treated the Prote&s;tants; for which, he &s;aid, both he and all his friends blamed him. I was carried by a Bi&s;hop to the <HI>Je|&s;uits</HI> at St. <HI>Anthoine's.</HI> There I &s;aw <HI>P. Bourdalou,</HI> e&s;teemed one of the greate&s;t preachers of the age, and one of the honours of his order. He was a man of a &s;weet temper, not at all violent again&s;t Prote&s;tants: On the contrary, he believed good men among them might be &s;aved, which was a pitch in charity that I had never ob&s;erved in any of the learned of that Communion. I was al&s;o once with <HI>P. de la
<PB N="567" REF="582">
Chai&s;e,</HI> the King's Confe&s;&s;or, who was a dry man. He told me, how great a man they would make me, if I would come over to them.</P>
<P>This was my acquaintance on the Popi&s;h &s;ide. I &s;ay lit|tle of the Prote&s;tants. They came all to me: So I was well known among them. The method that carried over the men of the fine&s;t parts among them to Popery was this: They brought them&s;elves to doubt of the whole Chri&s;tian Religion: When that was once done, it &s;eemed a more in|different thing of what &s;ide or form they continued to be outwardly. The ba&s;e practices of buying many over with pen&s;ions, and of driving others over with perpetual ill u&s;age and the acts of the highe&s;t inju&s;tice and violence, and the vile artifices in bringing on and carrying &s;o many proce&s;&s;es again&s;t mo&s;t of their Churches, as not comprehended within the edict of <HI>Nantes,</HI> were a reproach both to the greatne&s;s of their King and to the ju&s;tice of their Courts. Many new edicts were coming out every day again&s;t them, which contradicted the edict of <HI>Nantes</HI> in the mo&s;t expre&s;s words po&s;&s;ible: And yet to all the&s;e a &s;trange clau&s;e was added, That the King did not intend by them to recal, nor to go again&s;t any article of the edict of <HI>Nantes,</HI> which he would maintain inviolable. I knew <HI>Spanheim</HI> particularly, who was Envoy from the Elector of <HI>Brandenbourg,</HI> who is the greate&s;t critick of the age in all ancient learning, and is with that a very able man in all affairs, and a frank cheerful man: Qualities that do not always meet in very learned men. Af|ter a few months &s;tay I returned, and found both the King and Duke were highly offended with the reception I had met with in <HI>France.</HI> They did not know what to make of it, and fancied there was &s;omething hid under it.</P>
<P>The addre&s;&s;es had now gone round <HI>England.</HI> The Grand <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>England</HI></NOTE> Juries made after that high pre&s;entments again&s;t all that were e&s;teemed Whigs and Non-conformi&s;ts. Great pains were taken to find out more witne&s;&s;es. Pardons and rewards were offered very freely. But none came in: Which made it evident, that nothing was &s;o well laid, or brought &s;o near execution, as the witne&s;&s;es had depo&s;ed: Otherwi&s;e people would have been crouding in for pardons. All people were apprehen|&s;ive of very black de&s;igns, when they &s;aw <HI>Jefferies</HI> made Lord <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jefferies</HI> and other Judges preferred.</NOTE> Chief Ju&s;tice, who was &s;candalou&s;ly vitious, and was drunk every day; be&s;ides a drunkenne&s;s of fury in his temper, that looked like Enthu&s;ia&s;m. He did not con&s;ider the decencies of his po&s;t: Nor did he &s;o much as affect to &s;eem impartial,
<PB N="568" REF="583">
as became a Judge; but run out upon all occa&s;ions into de|clamations, that did not become the Bar, much le&s;s the Bench. He was not learned in his profe&s;&s;ion: And his elo|quence, tho' vitiou&s;ly copious, yet was neither correct nor agreeable. <HI>Pemberton</HI> was turned out of the Common Pleas, and <HI>Jones</HI> was put in his place: And <HI>Jefferies</HI> had three Judges joined with him in the King's Bench, fit to &s;it by him.</P>
<P>The King &s;ent a new me&s;&s;age to the City of <HI>London,</HI> re|quiring the Common Council to deliver up their Charter, threatning them, that otherwi&s;e he would order the judg|ment to be entred. Upon this a great debate aro&s;e among them. Some were for their compliance, that they might pre|vent the prejudice that would otherwi&s;e ari&s;e. On the other hand it was &s;aid, that all freemen took an oath to maintain the rights of their Corporation: So that it was perjury in them to betray the&s;e. They &s;aid, it was better to leave the matter to the King, than by any act of their own to deli|ver all up. So it was carried not to do it by a few voices. Upon that the judgment was entred: And the King &s;eized on their liberties. Many of the Aldermen and other officers were turned out. And others were put in their places. So they continued for &s;ome time a City without a Charter, or a Common Council: And the King named the magi&s;trates. New Charters were &s;ent to mo&s;t of the Corporations, in which the King re&s;erved a power to him&s;elf to turn out magi&s;trates at his plea&s;ure. This was done to make all &s;ure for a new election of Parliament, which came now under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>There was a clau&s;e in the act that repealed the triennial bill, which had pa&s;t in the beginning of the troubles, which <NOTE PLACE="marg">1684 The calling a Parliament propo&s;ed, but rejected.</NOTE> enacted that a Parliament &s;hould meet every third year: But it had none of tho&s;e enforcing clau&s;es, in ca&s;e it did not meet, that were in the other act: And the third year from the Par|liament of <HI>Oxford</HI> was now near an end. So, &s;ince the King had declared he would govern according to law, and in par|ticular that he would have frequent Parliaments, for which he had &s;pecial thanks given him in many of the addre&s;&s;es, it was propo&s;ed that a Parliament &s;hould be called. A war &s;eemed like to break out in <HI>Flanders;</HI> where the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> how ill &s;oever they were prepared for it, had declared war, upon the <HI>French</HI> troops po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of <HI>Dixmuyd</HI> and <HI>Courtray.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was pre&s;&s;ing the States to go into a new war, rather than let <HI>Luxembourg</HI> be taken. But this was much oppo&s;ed by the Town of <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI> The
<PB N="569" REF="584">
calling a new Parliament here, and <HI>England</HI>'s engaging, as all believed they might do, would be an effectual re&s;traint on the <HI>French.</HI> But the King had con&s;ented to let <HI>Luxem|bourg</HI> fall into their hands: So it was apprehended that the Parliament might fall upon that, which was the only point that could occa&s;ion any difference between the King and them. It was al&s;o &s;aid, that it was fit all the Charters &s;hould be fir&s;t brought in, and all the Corporations new modelled, before the Parliament &s;hould be called. The prerogative lawyers pretended, that the prerogative was indeed limited by negative and prohibiting words, but not by affirmative words. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> told me, he pre&s;&s;ed this all he could; but there was a <HI>French</HI> intere&s;t working &s;trongly again&s;t it: So the thoughts of a Parliament at that time were laid a&s;ide. The <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> pri&s;oners were ordered to be &s;ent down to be tried in <HI>Scotland.</HI> This was &s;ad news to them: For the boots there are a &s;evere torture. <HI>Baillie</HI> had rea&s;on to expect the wor&s;t u&s;age: He was carried to <HI>Newgate</HI> in the morning that Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> was tried, to &s;ee if he could be per&s;uaded to be a witne&s;s again&s;t him. Every thing that could work on him was made u&s;e of, but all in vain: So they were re&s;olved to u&s;e him &s;everely.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed &s;lightly over the &s;u&s;picions that were rai&s;ed up|on <NOTE PLACE="marg">Su&s;picions of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s being mur|dered.</NOTE> Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s death, when I mentioned that matter. This winter the bu&s;ine&s;s was brought to a trial: A boy and a girl did report, that they heard great crying in his lodgings, and that they &s;aw a bloody razor flung out at window, which was taken up by a woman that came out of the hou&s;e where he was lodged. The&s;e children reported this confidently that very day, when they went to their &s;everal homes: They were both about ten or twelve years old. The boy went backward and forward in his &s;tory, &s;ometimes affirming it, and at other times denying it: But his father had an office in the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e: So it was thought, he prevailed with him to deny it in open Court. But the girl &s;tood firmly to her &s;tory. The &s;implicity of the children, together with the ill opinion that was generally had of the Court, inclined many to believe this. As &s;oon as his Lady heard of it, &s;he ordered a &s;trict enquiry to be made about it; and &s;ent what &s;he found to me, to whom &s;he had tru&s;ted all the me&s;&s;ages that had pa&s;t between her Lord and her while he was in the Tower. When I peru&s;ed all, I thought there was not a colour to found any pro&s;ecution on; which &s;he would have done with all po&s;&s;ible zeal, if &s;he had found any ap|pearances
<PB N="570" REF="585">
of truth in the matter. Lord <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had got into an odd &s;et of &s;ome &s;trange principles: And in particular he thought, a man was the ma&s;ter of his own life; and &s;eemed to approve of what his wife's great grandfather, the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> did, who &s;hot him&s;elf in the Tower after he was arraigned. He had al&s;o very black fits of the &s;pleen. But at that time one <HI>Braddon,</HI> whom I had known for &s;ome years for an hone&s;t but enthu&s;ia&s;tical man, hearing of the&s;e &s;tories, re&s;olved to carry the matter as far as it would go: And he had pickt up a great variety of little circum&s;tances, all which laid together &s;eemed to him &s;o convincing, that he thought he was bound to pro&s;ecute the matter. I de&s;ir|ed him to come no more near me, &s;ince he was &s;o po&s;i|tive. He talked of the matter &s;o publickly, that he was taken up for &s;preading fal&s;e news to alienate people's hearts from the King. He was tried upon it. Both the children owned, that they had reported the matter as he had talk|ed it; the boy &s;aying then, that it was a lie. <HI>Braddon</HI> had de&s;ired the boy to &s;et it all under his hand, tho' with that he charged him to write nothing but the truth. This was called a &s;uborning: And he was fined for it in 2000 <HI>l.</HI> But I go next to a trial of more importance.</P>
<P><HI>Howard</HI> was the only evidence again&s;t the pri&s;oners of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sidney</HI>'s trial.</NOTE> better rank; for they had no communication with the other witne&s;&s;es. So other things were to be found out as &s;upple|ments to &s;upport it. <HI>Sidney</HI> was next brought to his trial. A Jury was returned, con&s;i&s;ting for mo&s;t part of very mean per&s;ons. Men's pul&s;es were tried beforehand, to &s;ee how tractable they would be. One <HI>Parry,</HI> a violent man, guilty of &s;everal murders, was not only pardoned, but was now made a Ju&s;tice of Peace, for his officious meddling and vio|lence. He told one of the Duke's &s;ervants, thinking that &s;uch a one was certainly of their party, that he had &s;ent in a great many names of jurors, who were &s;ure men: That per&s;on told me this him&s;elf. <HI>Sidney</HI> excepted to their not being freeholders. But <HI>Jefferies</HI> &s;aid, that had been over|ruled in Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s ca&s;e: And therefore he over-ruled it; and would not &s;o much as &s;uffer <HI>Sidney</HI> to read the &s;tatute. This was one of his bold &s;trains. Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> was tried at the <HI>Old Baily,</HI> where the Jury con&s;i&s;ted of <HI>Londoners:</HI> And there indeed the contrary practice had prevailed, upon the rea&s;on before mentioned; for the merchants are &s;uppo&s;ed to be rich: But this trail was in <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> where the contrary practice had not prevailed; for in a county a man who is no
<PB N="571" REF="586">
freeholder is &s;uppo&s;ed to be poor. But <HI>Jefferies</HI> &s;aid on another occa&s;ion, why might not they make precedents to the &s;ucceeding times, as well as tho&s;e who had gone before them had made precedents for them? The witne&s;&s;es of the other parts of the plot were now brought out again to make a &s;hew; for they knew nothing of <HI>Sidney.</HI> Only they &s;aid, that they had heard of a Council of &s;ix, and that he was one of them. Yet even in that they contradicted one another; <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> &s;wearing that he had it from <HI>We&s;t,</HI> and <HI>We&s;t</HI> &s;wearing that he had it from him; which was not ob&s;erved till the trial came out. If it had been ob&s;erved &s;ooner, perhaps <HI>Jefferies</HI> would have ordered it to be &s;truck out; as he did all that <HI>Sidney</HI> had objected upon the point of the Jury, becau&s;e they were not freeholders. <HI>Howard</HI> gave his evidence, with a preface that had become a plea|der better than a witne&s;s. He ob&s;erved the uniformity of truth, and that all the parts of his evidence and theirs met together as two tallies. After this a book was produced, which <HI>Sidney</HI> had been writing, and which was found in his clo&s;et, in an&s;wer to <HI>Filmer</HI>'s book entitled <HI>Patriarcha;</HI> by which <HI>Filmer</HI> a&s;&s;erted the divine right of monarchy, upon the elde&s;t &s;on's &s;ucceeding to the authority of the father. It was a book of &s;ome name, but &s;o poorly writ, that it was &s;omewhat &s;trange that <HI>Sidney</HI> be&s;towed &s;o much pains in an&s;wering it. In this an&s;wer he had a&s;&s;erted, that Princes had their power from the people with re&s;trictions and limi|tations; and that they were liable to the Ju&s;tice of the peo|ple, if they abu&s;ed their power to the prejudice of the &s;ub|jects, and again&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed laws. This by an Innuendo was &s;aid to be an evidence to prove, that he was in a plot again&s;t the King's life. And it was in&s;i&s;ted on, that this ought to &s;tand as a &s;econd witne&s;s. The Earls of <HI>Clare, Angle&s;ey,</HI> and &s;ome others with my &s;elf, depo&s;ed what Lord <HI>Howard</HI> had &s;aid, denying there was any plot. <HI>Blake,</HI> a dra|per, depo&s;ed, that having a&s;ked him when he was to have his pardon, he an&s;wered, not till the drudgery of &s;wearing was over. <HI>Howard</HI> had al&s;o gone to <HI>Sidney</HI>'s hou&s;e, and had a&s;&s;ured his &s;ervants that there was nothing again&s;t him, and had de&s;ired them to bring his goods to his own hou&s;e. <HI>Sidney</HI> &s;hewed, how improbable it was that <HI>Howard,</HI> who could not rai&s;e five men, and had not five &s;hillings to pay them, &s;hould be taken into &s;uch con&s;ultations. As for the book, it was not proved to be writ by him; for it was a judged ca&s;e in capital matters, that a &s;imilitude of hands was not a
<PB N="572" REF="587">
legal proof, tho' it was in civil matters: That whatever was in tho&s;e papers, they were his own private thoughts, and &s;peculations of government, never communicated to any: It was al&s;o evident, that the book had been writ &s;ome years ago: So that could not be pretended to be a proof of a late plot: The book was not fini&s;hed: So it could not be known how it would end: A man writing again&s;t Athei&s;m, who &s;ets out the &s;trength of it, if he does not fini&s;h his an&s;wer, could not be concluded an Athei&s;t, becau&s;e there was &s;uch a Chapter in his book. <HI>Jefferies</HI> interrupted him often very rudely, probably to put him in a pa&s;&s;ion, to which he was &s;ubject: But he maintained his temper to admiration. <HI>Finch</HI> aggravated the matter of the book, as a proof of his inten|tions, pretending it was an overt-act; for he &s;aid, <HI>&s;cribere e&s;t agere. Jefferies</HI> delivered it as law, and &s;aid, that all the Judges were of the &s;ame mind, That if there were two wit|ne&s;&s;es, the one to the trea&s;on, the other only to a circum|&s;tance, &s;uch as the buying a knife, the&s;e made the two wit|ne&s;&s;es, which the &s;tatute required in ca&s;es of trea&s;on. In conclu&s;ion, <HI>Sidney</HI> was ca&s;t. And &s;ome days after he was brought to Court to receive &s;entence. He then went over his objections to the evidence again&s;t him, in which Judge <HI>Withins</HI> interrupted him, and by a &s;trange indecency gave him the lie in open Court. But he bore it patiently. He &s;ent to Lord <HI>Halifax,</HI> who was his nephew by marriage, a paper to be laid before the King, containing the main points of his defence: Upon which he appealed to the King, and de&s;ired he would review the whole matter. <HI>Jefferies</HI> up|on that in his furious way &s;aid, either <HI>Sidney</HI> mu&s;t die, or he mu&s;t die. His execution was re&s;pited for three weeks, the trial being univer&s;ally cried out on, as a piece of mo&s;t en|ormous inju&s;tice. When he &s;aw the warrant of his execu|tion, he expre&s;&s;ed no concern at it. And the change that was now in his temper amazed all that went to him. He told the Sheriffs that brought it, he would not expo&s;tulate upon any thing on his own account; (for the world was now nothing to him;) but he de&s;ired, they would con&s;ider how guilty they were of his blood, who had not returned a fair Jury, but one packt, and as they were directed by the King's Solicitor: He &s;poke this to them, not for his own &s;ake, but for their &s;ake. One of the Sheriffs was &s;truck with this, and wept. He told it to a per&s;on, from whom <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> had it, who told it me. <HI>Sidney</HI> wrote a long vindication of him|&s;elf, (which I read,) and &s;ummed up the &s;ub&s;tance of it
<PB N="573" REF="588">
in a paper that he gave the Sheriffs: But, &s;u&s;pecting they might &s;uppre&s;s it, he gave a copy of it to a friend. It was a fort|night <NOTE PLACE="marg">His executi|on and la&s;t paper.</NOTE> before it was printed, tho' we had all the &s;peeches of tho&s;e who died for the Popi&s;h plot printed the very next day. But, when it was under&s;tood that written copies of <HI>Sidney</HI>'s &s;peech were going about, it was al&s;o printed. In it he &s;hewed his innocence; that Lord <HI>Howard</HI> was a infa|mous per&s;on, and that no credit was due to him: Yet he did not deny the matter he &s;wore again&s;t him. As for his book, he &s;hewed what rea&s;on all Princes had to abhor <HI>Filmer</HI>'s maxims: For if primogeniture from <HI>Noah</HI> was the ground &s;ettled by God for monarchy, then all the Princes now in the world were U&s;urpers: None claiming by that pedigree, and this primogen iture being only in one per&s;on. He &s;aid, &s;ince God did not now by any declaration of his will, as of old by Prophets, mark out &s;uch or &s;uch per&s;ons for Princes, they could have no title, but what was founded on law and compact: And this was that in which the diffe|rence lay between lawful Princes and U&s;urpers: If po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion was a donation from God, (which <HI>Filmer</HI> had &s;ub&s;ti|tuted to the conceit of primogeniture,) then every pro&s;pe|rous U&s;urper had a good right. He concluded with a prayer, that the nation might be pre&s;erved from idolatry and tyran|ny. And he &s;aid, he rejoyced that he &s;uffered for the old cau&s;e, in which he was &s;o early engaged. The&s;e la&s;t words furni&s;hed much matter to the &s;criblers of that time. In his impri&s;onment he &s;ent for &s;ome Independent preachers, and expre&s;&s;ed to them a deep remor&s;e for his pa&s;t &s;ins, and great confidence in the mercies of God. And indeed he met death with an unconcernedne&s;s, that became one who had &s;et up <HI>Marcus Brutus</HI> for his pattern. He was but a very few minutes on the &s;caffold at Tower Hill: He &s;poke little, and prayed very &s;hort: And his head was cut off at one blow.</P>
<P>At this time an accident hapned, that &s;urpri&s;ed both the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Monmouth</HI> came in, and was pardon|ed.</NOTE> Court and City; and which, if well managed, might probably have produced great effects. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> had lurked in <HI>England</HI> all this &s;ummer, and was then de&s;igning to go beyond &s;ea, and to engage in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;ervice. The King &s;till loved him pa&s;&s;ionately. Lord <HI>Halifax,</HI> &s;ee|ing matters run &s;o much further than he apprehended, thought that nothing could &s;top that &s;o effectually, as the bringing the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> again into favour. That Duke writ to the King &s;everal letters, penned with an ex|traordinary
<PB N="574" REF="589">
force. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> drew them all, as he him|&s;elf told me, and &s;hewed me his own draughts of them. By the&s;e the King was mollified, and re&s;olved to re&s;tore him again to his favour. It &s;tuck much at the confe&s;&s;ion that he was to make. The King promi&s;ed, that no u&s;e &s;hould be made of it: But he &s;tood on it, that he mu&s;t tell him the whole truth of the matter. Upon which he con|&s;ented to &s;atisfy the King. But he would &s;ay nothing to the Duke, more than to a&s;k his pardon in a general comple|ment. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> had pre&s;&s;ed him earne&s;tly upon his fir&s;t appearance to be &s;ilent, and for a while to bear the cen&s;ures of the Town. The la&s;t day of the term was very near, in which all the pri&s;oners were to be di&s;charged ac|cording to the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> act. That would &s;hew he had di&s;covered nothing to their prejudice. So that all di&s;cour&s;es concerning his confe&s;&s;ion and di&s;coveries would vani&s;h in a few days. And if he had followed this, probably it would have given a great turn to affairs. The King &s;poke nothing of the reconciliation to the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> till the day before it was to be done. He was much &s;truck with it: But the King was po&s;itive. Yet the Duke's creatures in the Cabinet Coun|cil moved, that for form's &s;ake he &s;hould be for &s;ome days put in the Tower. The King cut that off by &s;aying, he had promi&s;ed to pardon him. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> as was agreed, made a humble confe&s;&s;ion of his offences in ge|neral words to the King; and made a complement to the Duke, and begg'd that he would intercede with the King to pardon him. The King received him with a fondne&s;s that confounded all the Duke's party: He u&s;ed him more ten|derly than he had done formerly. The Duke put on an outward appearance of being very well plea&s;ed with it. The King &s;aid next day, that <HI>James</HI> (for &s;o he called him) had confirmed all that <HI>Howard</HI> had &s;worn. This was carried to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> who denied he had ever &s;aid any &s;uch thing; adding, that Lord <HI>Howard</HI> was a liar and a rogue: And this was &s;et round the Town by his creatures, who run with it from Coffee-Hou&s;e to Coffee-Hou&s;e. The next Gazette mentioned, that the King had pardoned him upon his confe&s;&s;ing the late plot. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> pre&s;&s;ed the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> to pa&s;s that over, and to impute it to the importunity of his enemies, and to the King's ea&s;ine&s;s: But he could not prevail. Yet he &s;aid little till his pardon was pa&s;t. But then he openly denied, that he had con|fe&s;&s;ed the plot. By that he engaged him&s;elf in a plain con|tradiction
<PB N="575" REF="590">
to what the King had &s;aid. Some were brought by the Duke to the King, who confirmed, they had heard the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> &s;ay, that he had not confe&s;&s;ed the plot: Upon which the King ordered him to give a confe&s;&s;ion of it under his hand. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> pre&s;&s;ed him to write a letter to the King, acknowledging he had confe&s;&s;ed the plot. Plot was a general word, that might &s;ignify as much or little as a man plea&s;ed: They had certainly dangerous con&s;ultations among them, which might be well called plots. He &s;aid, the &s;ervice he might do his friends by &s;uch a general let|ter, and by his gaining the King's heart upon it, would quickly balance the &s;eeming prejudice that &s;uch a general acknowledgment would bring them under, which could do them no hurt. Upon that he got him to write a letter to that purpo&s;e which he carried to the King. And the King was &s;atisfied. But the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> whether of him&s;elf, or upon the &s;ugge&s;tion of others, reflect|ed on what he had done, and thought it a ba&s;e thing. Tho' this was no evidence, yet he thought it might have an influence on Juries, to make them believe every thing that might be &s;worn by other witne&s;&s;es, when from his con|fe&s;&s;ion they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a general belief of the plot. So he went full of unea&s;ine&s;s to the King, and de&s;ired he might have his letter again, in the terms of an agony like de&s;pair. The King gave it back, but pre&s;&s;ed him ve|hemently to comply with his de&s;ire: And among other things <NOTE PLACE="marg">But &s;oon af|ter di&s;graced.</NOTE> the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> &s;aid, that the King u&s;ed this expre&s;|&s;ion, If you do not yield in this you will ruin me. Yet he was firm. So the King forbid him the Court, and &s;poke of him more &s;everely than he had ever done formerly. He was upon this more valued, and tru&s;ted by his own party than ever. After &s;ome days he went beyond &s;ea: And af|ter a &s;hort concealment he appeared publickly in <HI>Holland,</HI> and was treated by the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> with a very par|ticular re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The Prince had come for a few days to <HI>England</HI> after the <HI>Oxford</HI> Parliament, and had much private di&s;cour&s;e with the King at <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI> The King a&s;&s;ured him, that he would keep things quiet, and not give way to the Duke's eagerne&s;s, as long as he lived: And added, he was confident, whenever the Duke &s;hould come to reign, he would be &s;o re&s;tle&s;s and violent, that he could not hold it four years to an end. This I had from the Prince's own mouth. Another pa&s;&s;age was told me by the Earl of <HI>Portland.</HI> The King &s;hewed
<PB N="576" REF="591">
the Prince one of his &s;eals; and told him, that whatever he might write to him, if the letter was not &s;ealed with that &s;eal, he was to look on it as only drawn from him by im|portunity. The rea&s;on for which I mention that in this place is, becau&s;e, tho' the King wrote &s;ome terrible letters to the Prince again&s;t the countenance he gave to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> yet they were not &s;ealed with that &s;eal; from which the Prince inferred, that the King had a mind that he &s;hould keep him about him, and u&s;e him well. And the King gave orders, that in all the entries that were made in the Council books of this whole bu&s;ine&s;s nothing &s;hould be left on record that could blemi&s;h him.</P>
<P><HI>Hamden</HI> was now the only man of the &s;ix that was left. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hamden</HI>'s trial.</NOTE> Yet there was nothing but <HI>Howard</HI>'s evidence again&s;t him, without &s;o much as any circum&s;tance to &s;upport it. So &s;ince two witne&s;&s;es were nece&s;&s;ary to trea&s;on, (whereas one was enough for a mi&s;demeanor,) he was indicted of a mi&s;de|meanor, tho' the crime was either trea&s;on or nothing. <HI>Jef|feries,</HI> upon <HI>Howard</HI>'s evidence, charged the Jury to bring him in guilty: Otherwi&s;e, he told them, they would di&s;credit all that had been done before. So they brought him in guilty. And the Court &s;et 40000 <HI>l.</HI> fine on him, the mo&s;t extravagant fine that had ever been &s;et for a mi&s;deneanor in that Court. It amounted indeed to an impri&s;onment for life.</P>
<P>Some time in the &s;pring eighty four <HI>Halloway</HI> was taken <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Halloway</HI>'s execution.</NOTE> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and &s;ent over. He was under an out|lawry for trea&s;on. The Attorney General offered him a trial, if he de&s;ired it. But he was prevailed on, by the hope of a pardon, to &s;ubmit and confe&s;s all he knew. He &s;aid, he was drawn into &s;ome meetings, in which they con|&s;ulted how to rai&s;e an in&s;urrection, and that he and two more had undertaken to manage a de&s;ign for &s;eizing on <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> with the help of &s;ome that were to come to them from <HI>Taunton:</HI> But he added, that they had never made any progre&s;s in it. He &s;aid, at their meetings at <HI>London, Rum|&s;ey</HI> and <HI>We&s;t</HI> were often talking of <HI>lopping</HI> the King and the Duke: But that he had never entred into any di&s;cour&s;e with them upon that &s;ubject: And he did not believe, there were above five per&s;ons that approved of it. The&s;e were <HI>We&s;t, Rum&s;ey, Rumbold,</HI> and his brother: The fifth per&s;on is not named in the printed relation. Some &s;aid, it was <HI>Fergu&s;on:</HI> Others &s;aid, it was <HI>Goodenough. Halloway</HI> was thought by the Court not to be &s;incere in his confe&s;&s;ion. And &s;o, &s;ince what he had acknowledged made him&s;elf very guilty, he was exe|cuted,
<PB N="577" REF="592">
and died with a firm con&s;tancy. He &s;hewed great pre&s;ence of mind. He ob&s;erved the partiality that was evi|dent in managing this plot, different from what had ap|peared in managing the Popi&s;h plot. The &s;ame men who were called rogues, when they &s;wore again&s;t Papi&s;ts, were looked on as hone&s;t men, when they turned their evidence again&s;t Prote&s;tants. In all his an&s;wers to the Sheriffs, who at the place of execution troubled him with many impertinent que&s;tions, he an&s;wered them with &s;o much life, and yet with &s;o much temper, that it appeared he was no ordinary man. His &s;peech was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed for &s;ome days: But it broke out at la&s;t. In it he expre&s;&s;ed a deep &s;en&s;e of Religion: His prayer was an excellent compo&s;ure. The credit of the <HI>Rye-Plot</HI> received a great blow by his confe&s;&s;ion. All that di&s;cour&s;e about an in&s;urrection, in which the day was &s;aid to be &s;et, appeared now to be a fiction; &s;ince <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> had been &s;o little taken care of, that three per&s;ons had only undertaken to di&s;po&s;e people to that de&s;ign, but had not yet let it out to any of them. So that it was plain, that after all the &s;tory they had made of the plot, it had gone no further, than that a company of &s;editious and incon&s;ide|ble per&s;ons were framing among them&s;elves &s;ome trea&s;onable &s;chemes, that were never likely to come to any thing; and that <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> and <HI>We&s;t</HI> had pu&s;hed on the execrable de&s;ign of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, in which, tho' there were few that agreed to it, yet too many had heard it from them, who were both &s;o fooli&s;h, and &s;o wicked, as not to di&s;cover them.</P>
<P>But if the Court lo&s;t much by the death of <HI>Halloway,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arm&s;trong</HI>'s death.</NOTE> whom they had brought from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> they lo&s;t much more by their proceedings again&s;t Sir <HI>Thomas Arm&s;trong,</HI> who was &s;urpri&s;ed at <HI>Leyden,</HI> by vertue of a warrant that <HI>Chud|leigh</HI> the King's Envoy had obtained from the States, for &s;eizing on &s;uch as &s;hould fly out of <HI>England</HI> on the account of the plot. So the Scout at <HI>Leyden,</HI> for 5000 gilders, &s;eiz|ed on him; and delivered him to <HI>Chudleigh,</HI> who &s;ent him over in great ha&s;t. <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI> in that confu&s;ion forgot to claim that he was a native of the States: For he was born at <HI>Nimeguen:</HI> And that would have obliged the <HI>Dutch</HI> to have protected him, as one of their natural born &s;ubjects. He was tru&s;ted in every thing by the Duke of <HI>Monmouth:</HI> And he having led a very vitious life, the Court hoped that he, not being able to bear the thoughts of dying, would di&s;|cover every thing. He &s;hewed &s;uch a dejection of mind, while he was concealing him&s;elf before he e&s;caped out of
<PB N="578" REF="593">
<HI>England,</HI> that <HI>Hamden,</HI> who &s;aw him at that time, told me, he believed he would certainly do any thing that would &s;ave his life. Yet all were di&s;appointed in him: For when he was examined before the Council, he &s;aid, he knew of no plot but the Popi&s;h plot: He de&s;ired, he might have a fair trial for his life: That was all he a&s;ked. He was loaded with irons; tho' that was not ordinary for a man who had &s;erved in &s;uch po&s;ts, as to be Lieutenant of the fir&s;t troop of guards, and Gentleman of the hor&s;e to the King. There was nothing again&s;t him, but what <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Shepherd</HI> had &s;worn of the di&s;cour&s;es at <HI>Shepherd</HI>'s, for which Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> had &s;uffered. But by this time the credit of the witne&s;&s;es was &s;o bla&s;ted, that it &s;eems the Court was afraid that Juries would not now be &s;o ea&s;y as they had been. The thing that <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> had &s;worn again&s;t him &s;eemed not very credible: For he &s;wore that at the fir&s;t meeting <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI> undertook to go and view the guards in order to the &s;eizing them; and that upon a view he &s;aid at a &s;econd meeting that the thing was very fei&s;i|ble. But <HI>Arm&s;trong,</HI> who had commanded the guards &s;o long, knew every thing that related to them &s;o well, that without &s;uch a tran&s;ient view he could of the &s;udden have an&s;wered every thing relating to them. The Court had a mind to proceed in a &s;ummary way with him, that he &s;hould by the hurry of it be driven to &s;ay any thing that could &s;ave him. He was now in an outlawry: But tho' the &s;ta|tute was expre&s;s, that if an outlawed per&s;on came in at any time within the year, he was to have a trial notwith|&s;tanding his outlawry. It was pretended in an&s;wer to this, that he not coming in, but being taken, had not a right to the be|nefit of the &s;tatute. But there were &s;everal months of the year yet to run. And &s;ince a trial was a demand founded on natural ju&s;tice, he in&s;i&s;ted on it. And when he was brought to the King's bench bar, and a&s;ked what he had to &s;ay why &s;entence &s;hould not be executed, he claimed the benefit of the &s;tatute. He &s;aid, he had yet, when he was taken, &s;everal months to de|liberate upon his coming in: And the &s;eizing on him before his time was out, ought not to bar him a right that the law gave him. He al&s;o mentioned <HI>Halloway,</HI> to whom a trial was offered the former term. And, &s;ince it was a point of law, he de&s;ired Council might be heard to argue it. <HI>Jef|feries</HI> rejected all this: He &s;aid, the King might either offer a trial or not, as he &s;aw cau&s;e: And he refu&s;ed to hear Council: Which being demanded upon a point of law,
<PB N="579" REF="594">
the denying it was thought a very impudent piece of in|ju&s;tice. And when <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI> in&s;i&s;ted, that he a&s;ked nothing but the law, <HI>Jefferies</HI> in his brutal way &s;aid, he &s;hould have it to the full; and &s;o ordered his execution within &s;ix days. And the law was executed on him with the utmo&s;t rigor: For he was carried to <HI>Tyburn</HI> in a &s;ledge, and was quarter|ed, and his quarters were &s;et up. His carriage, during his impri&s;onment and at his death, was far beyond what could have been imagined. He turned him&s;elf wholly to the thoughts of God, and of another &s;tate; and was praying con|tinually. He rejoiced, that he was brought to die in &s;uch a manner. He &s;aid, it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for him to have been awaken'd into a due &s;en&s;e of his &s;ins by any other me|thod. His pride and his re&s;entments were then &s;o entirely conquered, that one who &s;aw him &s;aid to me, that it was not ea&s;y to think it was the &s;ame per&s;on whom he had known formerly. He received the Sacrament; and died in &s;o good a temper, and with &s;o much quiet in his mind, and &s;o &s;erene a deportment, that we have &s;carce known in our time a more eminent in&s;tance of the grace and mercy of God. <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI> in his la&s;t paper denied, that he ever knew of any de&s;ign again&s;t the King's, or the Duke's life, or was in any plot again&s;t the government. There were no remarks publi&s;hed on his &s;peech, which it was believed the Court ordered: For they &s;aw how much ground they had lo&s;t by this &s;tretch of law, and how little they had gained by his death. One pa&s;&s;age in it was the occa&s;ion of their ordering no &s;uch reflections to be made on it, as had been made on the other &s;peeches. The King had publi&s;hed a &s;tory all about the Court, and had told it to the foreign Mini&s;ters, as the rea&s;on of this extream &s;everity again&s;t <HI>Arm&s;trong:</HI> He &s;aid, that he was &s;ent over by <HI>Crom|well</HI> to murder him beyond &s;ea, and that he was warned of it, and challenged him on it; and that upon his con|fe&s;&s;ing it he had promi&s;ed him never to &s;peak of it any more as long as he lived. So the King, counting him now dead in law, thought he was free from that promi&s;e. <HI>Arm|&s;trong</HI> took this heavily: And in one paper which I &s;aw, writ in his own hand, the re&s;entments upon it were &s;harper than I thought became a dying penitent. So, when that was repre&s;ented to him, he changed it: And in the paper he gave the Sheriffs he had &s;oftned it much. But yet he &s;hewed the fal&s;hood of that report: For he never went beyond &s;ea but once, &s;ent by the Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and &s;ome
<PB N="580" REF="595">
other Cavaliers, with a con&s;iderable pre&s;ent to the King in money, which he delivered; and brought back letters of thanks from the King to tho&s;e who made the pre&s;ent. But <HI>Cromwell</HI> having a hint of this clapt him up in pri&s;on, where he was kept almo&s;t a year. And upon the merit of that &s;ervice, he was made a Captain of hor&s;e &s;oon after the Re|&s;toration. When <HI>Jefferies</HI> came to the King at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> &s;oon after this trial, the King took a ring of good value from his finger, and gave it him for the&s;e &s;ervices: The ring upon that was called his blood &s;tone. The King gave him one advice, which was &s;omewhat extraordinary from a King to a Judge; but it was not the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to him: The King &s;aid, it was a hot &s;ummer, and he was going the cir|cuit, he therefore de&s;ired he would not drink too much. With this I leave the affairs of <HI>England</HI> to look towards <HI>Scot|land.</HI></P>
<P>Great pains were taken there to make a further di&s;covery of the negotiation between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Scots.</HI> A Gentle|man, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great &s;eve|nty in <HI>Scot|land.</HI></NOTE> who had been at <HI>Bothwell-Bridge,</HI> was &s;ent over by the <HI>Cargillites</HI> to &s;ome of their friends in <HI>Holland:</HI> And he carried with him &s;ome letters writ in an odd cant. He was &s;eized at <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> together with his letters; and was &s;o frighted, that he was ea&s;ily managed to pretend to di&s;cover any thing that was &s;ugge&s;ted to him. But he had never been at <HI>London:</HI> So he could &s;peak of that negotiation but upon hear&s;ay. His &s;tory was &s;o ill laid together, that the Court was a&s;ham|ed to make any u&s;e of it: But it turned heavily on him|&s;elf, for he went mad upon it. Two others came in, and charged Sir <HI>Hugh Cambell</HI> of <HI>Ce&s;nock,</HI> an antient Gentleman of a good e&s;tate, that he had &s;et on the rebellion of <HI>Both|well-Bridge,</HI> and had chid them for de&s;erting it. Upon this he was brought to a trial. In <HI>Scotland</HI> the law allows of an exculpation, by which the pri&s;oner is &s;uffered before his trial to prove the thing to be impo&s;&s;ible. This was prayed by that Gentleman, who had full proofs of his being el&s;ewhere, and at a great di&s;tance from the place, at that time. But that is a favour which the Court may grant, or not: So that was denied him. The fir&s;t witne&s;s that was examined at his trial began with a general &s;tory: And when he came to that, in which the pri&s;oner was concerned, <HI>Cambell</HI> charg|ed him to look him full in the face, and to con&s;ider well what he was to &s;ay of him; for he took God to witne&s;s, he never &s;aw his face before, as far as he could remember. Upon that the witne&s;s was &s;truck, and &s;topt; and &s;aid, he
<PB N="581" REF="596">
could &s;ay nothing of him. The Earl of <HI>Perth</HI> was then Ju&s;tice General, and offered to lead him into his &s;tory. But the Jury &s;topt that; and &s;aid, that he upon his oath had declared he knew nothing of the pri&s;oner, and that af|ter that they could have no regard to any thing that he might &s;ay. Upon which &s;ome &s;harp words pa&s;&s;ed between Lord <HI>Perth</HI> and them, in which he &s;hewed how ready he was to &s;acrifice ju&s;tice and innocent blood to his ambition. And that was yet gro&s;&s;er in this ca&s;e; becau&s;e his brother was promi&s;ed that Gentleman's e&s;tate, when it &s;hould be con|fi&s;cated. The &s;econd witne&s;s &s;aid nothing, but &s;eemed con|founded: So <HI>Cambell</HI> was acquitted by the Jury, but was &s;till kept in pri&s;on. The&s;e witne&s;&s;es were again examined before the Council: And they adhered to their fir&s;t depo&s;ition again&s;t the pri&s;oner. The law in <HI>Scotland</HI> is very &s;evere again&s;t fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es, and treats them as felons. But the government there would not di&s;courage &s;uch practices; of which, when they &s;hould be more lucky, they intended to make good u&s;e. The Circuits went round the Country, as was direct|ed by the Proclamation of the former year. Tho&s;e who were mo&s;t guilty compounded the matter, and paid liberally to a creature of the Lord Chancellor's, that their names might be left out of the citations. Others took the te&s;t: And that freed them from all further trouble. They &s;aid openly, that it was again&s;t their con&s;cience; but they &s;aw they could not live in <HI>Scotland</HI> unle&s;s they took it. Others ob&s;erved, that the &s;everity which the Pre&s;byterians formerly had u&s;ed, forcing all people to take their covenant, was now returned back on them in this te&s;t, that they were thus forced to take.</P>
<P>In the mean while a great breach was formed, and ap|peared <NOTE PLACE="marg">A breach in the Mini&s;try there.</NOTE> on all occa&s;ions, between the Earls of <HI>Aberdeen</HI> and <HI>Queensbury.</HI> The latter was very exact in his payments, both of the &s;oldiers and of the pen&s;ions: So his party became the &s;tronge&s;t. Lord <HI>Aberdeen</HI>'s method was this: He writ up letters to the Duke of all affairs, and offered expe|dients, which he pretended were concerted at <HI>Edenburgh;</HI> and &s;ent with them the draughts of &s;uch letters, as he de|&s;ired &s;hould be &s;ent down from the King. But the&s;e expe|dients were not concerted, as he &s;aid: They were only his own conceits. Lord <HI>Queensbury,</HI> offended with this, let the Duke under&s;tand how he had been deceived. So an order was &s;ent down that all expedients &s;hould be concerted by a Junto, con&s;i&s;ting of Lord <HI>Queensbury</HI>'s creatures. Lord
<PB N="582" REF="597">
<HI>Aberdeen</HI> &s;aw that by this he came to &s;ignify little: And &s;ee|ing he was lo&s;ing ground at Court, he intended to recover him&s;elf a little with the people. So he re&s;olved for the fu|ture to keep to the law, and not to go beyond it. And &s;uch was the fury of that time, that this was called moderation and popularity. The Churches were now all well kept by the men: But their wives not being named in the act of Parliament, none of them went to Church. The matter was laid before the Council: And a debate aro&s;e upon it; whe|ther, man and wife making one per&s;on in law, hu&s;bands &s;hould not be fined for their wife's offence, as well as for their own. Lord <HI>Aberdeen</HI> &s;tood upon this, that the act did not mention the wives: It did indeed make the hu&s;bands lia|ble to a fine, if their wives went to Conventicles; for they had it in their power to re&s;train them: And &s;ince the law provided in the one ca&s;e, that the hu&s;band &s;hould &s;uffer for his wife's fault, but had made no provi&s;ion in the other ca&s;e, as to their going to Church, he thought the fining them on that account could not be legally done. Lord <HI>Queens|bury</HI> was for every thing that would bring money into the trea&s;ury: So, &s;ince in tho&s;e parts the Ladies had for many years withdrawn wholly from the Churches, he reckoned the &s;etting fines on their hu&s;bands to the rigour would make all the e&s;tates of the Country be at mercy; for the &s;elling them outright would not have an&s;wered this demand for the of|fences of &s;o many years. The Earl of <HI>Perth</HI> &s;truck in with this, and &s;eemed to &s;et it up for a maxim, that the Pre&s;|byterians could not be governed, but with the extremity of rigour; and that they were irreconcileable enemies to the King and the Duke, and that therefore they ought to be extirpated. The Mini&s;try in <HI>Scotland</HI> being thus divided, they referred the deci&s;ion of the point to the King: And Lord <HI>Perth</HI> came up to have his re&s;olution upon it. The King determined again&s;t the Ladies: Which was thought very indecent; for in dubious ca&s;es the noblene&s;s of a Prince's temper &s;hould always turn him to the merciful &s;ide. This was the le&s;s expected from the King, who had all his life time expre&s;&s;ed as great a neglect of women's con&s;ciences, as e&s;teem for their per&s;ons.</P>
<P>But to do him right, he was determined to it by the Duke; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke governed all affairs.</NOTE> who &s;ince the breaking out of the plot had got the whole management of affairs, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as well as <HI>Scotti&s;h,</HI> into his hands. <HI>Scotland</HI> was &s;o entirely in his dependance, that the King would &s;eldom a&s;k what the papers imported, which the
<PB N="583" REF="598">
Duke brought to be &s;igned by him. In <HI>England,</HI> the application and dependance was vi&s;ibly on the Duke. The King had &s;carce company about him to entertain him, when the Duke's levees and couchees were &s;o crouded, that the an|tichambers were full. The King walked about with a &s;mall train of the nece&s;&s;ary attendants, when the Duke had a va&s;t following: Which drew a lively reflection from <HI>Waller</HI> the celebrated wit. He &s;aid, the Hou&s;e of Commons had re&s;olv|ed that the Duke &s;hould not reign after the King's death: But the King in oppo&s;ition to them was re&s;olved he &s;hould reign even during his life. The breach grew to that heighth between Lord <HI>Aberdeen</HI> and Lord <HI>Queensbury,</HI> that both were called up to give an account of it. It ended in di&s;mi&s;&s;ing Lord <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and making Lord <HI>Perth</HI> Chancellor, to which he had been long a&s;piring in a mo&s;t indecent manner. He &s;aw into the Duke's temper, that his &s;pirit was turned to an unrelenting &s;everity: For this had appeared very indecently in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>When any are to be &s;truck in the boots, it is done in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The cruelty of the Duke, and of his Mini&s;ters, in torturing.</NOTE> pre&s;ence of the Council: And upon that occa&s;ion almo&s;t all offer to run away. The &s;ight is &s;o dreadful, that without an order re&s;training &s;uch a number to &s;tay the board would be for&s;aken. But the Duke, while he had been in <HI>Scotland,</HI> was &s;o far from withdrawing, that he looked on all the while with an unmoved indifference, and with an attention, as if he had been to look on &s;ome curious experiment. This gave a terrible idea of him to all that ob&s;erved it, as of a man that had no bowels nor humanity in him. Lord <HI>Perth,</HI> ob&s;erving this, re&s;olved to let him &s;ee how well qualified he was to be an Inqui&s;itor General. The rule about the boots in <HI>Scotland</HI> was, that upon one witne&s;s and pre&s;umptions both together, the que&s;tion might be given: But it was never known to be twice given; or that any other &s;pecies of tor|ture, be&s;ides the boots, might be u&s;ed at plea&s;ure. In the Court of Inqui&s;ition they do upon &s;u&s;picion, or if a man re|fu&s;es to an&s;wer upon oath as he is required, give him the torture; and repeat it, or vary it, as often as they think fit; and do not give over, till they have got out of their mangled pri&s;oners all that they have a mind to know from them.</P>
<P>This Lord <HI>Perth</HI> re&s;olved to make this his pattern: And was a little too early in letting the world &s;ee, what a govern|ment we were to expect under the influence of a Prince of that Religion. So, upon his going to <HI>Scotland</HI> one <HI>Spence,</HI> who was a &s;ervant of Lord <HI>Argile</HI>'s, and was taken up at <HI>London,</HI>
<PB N="584" REF="599">
only upon &s;u&s;picion, and &s;ent down to <HI>Scotland,</HI> was requir|ed to take an oath to an&s;wer all the que&s;tions that &s;hould be put to him. This was done in a direct contradiction to an expre&s;s law again&s;t obliging men to &s;wear, that they will an&s;wer <HI>&s;uper inquirendis. Spence</HI> likewi&s;e &s;aid, that he him|&s;elf might be concerned in what he might know: And it was again&s;t a very univer&s;al law, that excu&s;ed all men from &s;wear|ing again&s;t them&s;elves, to force him to take &s;uch an oath. So he was &s;truck in the boots, and continued firm in his re|fu&s;al. Then a new &s;pecies of torture was invented: He was kept from &s;leep eight or nine nights. They grew weary of managing this. So a third &s;pecies was invented: Little &s;crews of &s;teel were made u&s;e of, that &s;crewed the thumbs with &s;o exqui&s;ite a torment, that he &s;unk under this; for Lord <HI>Perth</HI> told him, they would &s;crew every joint of his whole body, one after another, till he took the oath. Yet &s;uch was the firm|ne&s;s and fidelity of this poor man, that even in that ex|tremity he capitulated, that no new que&s;tions &s;hould be put to him, but tho&s;e already agreed on; and that he &s;hould not be obliged to be a witne&s;s again&s;t any per&s;on, and that he him&s;elf &s;hould be pardoned: So all he could tell them was, who were Lord <HI>Argile</HI>'s corre&s;pondents. The chief of them was <HI>Holmes</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> to whom Lord <HI>Argile</HI> writ in a cypher, that had a peculiar curio&s;ity in it: A double key was ne|ce&s;&s;ary: The one was, to &s;hew the way of placing the words or cypher, in an order very different from that in which they lay in the paper: The other was, the key of the cyphers them&s;elves, which was found among <HI>Holmes</HI>'s papers, when he ab&s;conded. <HI>Spence</HI> knew only the fir&s;t of the&s;e: But he putting all in its true order, then by the other key they were decyphered. In the&s;e it appeared, what <HI>Argile</HI> had demand|ed, and what he undertook to do upon the granting his demands: But none of his letters &s;poke any thing of any agreement then made.</P>
<P>When the torture had this effect on <HI>Spence,</HI> they offered the &s;ame oath to <HI>Car&s;tairs.</HI> And, upon his refu&s;ing to take it, they put his thumbs in the &s;crews; and drew them &s;o hard, that as they put him to extream torture, &s;o they could not un&s;crew them, till the &s;mith that made them was brought with his tools to take them off. So he confe&s;&s;ed all he knew, which amounted to little more than &s;ome di&s;cour&s;es of taking off the Duke; to which he &s;aid that he an&s;wered, his principles could not come up to that: Yet in this he, who was a preacher among them, was highly to blame, for
<PB N="585" REF="600">
not revealing &s;uch black propo&s;itions; tho' it cannot be de|nied, but that it is a hard thing to di&s;cover any thing that is &s;aid in confidence: And therefore I &s;aved my &s;elf out of tho&s;e difficulties by &s;aying to all my friends, that I would not be involved in any &s;uch confidence; for as long as I thought our circum&s;tances were &s;uch that re&s;i&s;tance was not lawful, I thought the concealing any de&s;ign in order to it was likewi&s;e unlawful. And by this means I had pre&s;erved my &s;elf. But <HI>Car&s;tairs</HI> had at this time &s;ome &s;ecrets of great con&s;equence from <HI>Holland</HI> tru&s;ted to him by <HI>Fagel,</HI> of which they had no &s;u&s;picion: And &s;o they a&s;ked him no que&s;tions about them. Yet <HI>Fagel</HI> &s;aw by that, as he him&s;elf told me, how faithful <HI>Car&s;tairs</HI> was, &s;ince he could have &s;aved him|&s;elf from torture, and merited highly, if he had di&s;covered them. And this was the foundation of his favour with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and of the great confidence he put in him to his death.</P>
<P>Upon what was thus &s;crewed out of the&s;e two per&s;ons, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings again&s;t <HI>Baillie.</HI></NOTE> the Earl of <HI>Tarras,</HI> who had married the Duche&s;s of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI>'s elder &s;i&s;ter, and &s;ix or &s;even Gentlemen of Quality, were clapt up. The Mini&s;ters of State were &s;till mo&s;t ear|ne&s;tly &s;et on <HI>Baillie</HI>'s de&s;truction; tho' he was now in &s;o langui&s;hing a &s;tate, occa&s;ioned chiefly by the bad u&s;age he met with in pri&s;on, that if his death would have &s;atisfied the malice of the Court, that &s;eemed to be very near. But they knew how acceptable a &s;acrifice his dying in a more violent way would prove. So they continued even in that extremity to u&s;e him barbarou&s;ly. They were al&s;o trying what could be drawn from tho&s;e Gentlemen again&s;t him. <HI>Tarras</HI> had married his niece, who was his &s;econd wife. So they con|cluded that their confidence was entire. <HI>Baillie</HI>'s illne&s;s in|crea&s;ed daily: And his wife prayed for leave to attend on him: And, if they feared an e&s;cape, &s;he was willing to be put in irons: But that was denied. Nor would they &s;uffer his daugh|ter, a child of twelve years old, to attend him, even when he was &s;o low, that it was not probable he could live many weeks, his legs being much &s;welled. But upon the&s;e exami|nations a new method in proceeding again&s;t him was taken. An accu&s;ation was &s;ent him, not in the form of an indict|ment, nor grounded on any law, but on a letter of the King's, in which he charged him not only for a con&s;piracy to rai&s;e rebellion, but for being engaged in the <HI>Rye-plot;</HI> of all which he was now required to purge him&s;elf by oath, otherwi&s;e the Council would hold him guilty of it, and proceed accord|ingly.
<PB N="586" REF="601">
He was not, as they &s;aid, now in a criminal Court upon his life, but before the Council, who did only fine and impri&s;on. It was to no purpo&s;e for him to &s;ay, that by no law, unle&s;s it was in a Court of Inqui&s;ition, a man could be required to &s;wear again&s;t him&s;elf, the temptation to perjury being &s;o &s;trong when &s;elf-pre&s;ervation was in the ca&s;e, that it &s;eemed again&s;t all law and religion to lay &s;uch a &s;nare in a man's way. But to an&s;wer all this, it was pretended he was not now on his life, and that what&s;oever he confe&s;&s;ed was not to be made u&s;e of again&s;t his life; as if the ruin of his family, which con&s;i&s;ted of nine children, and perpetual impri&s;onment, were not more terrible, e&s;pecially to one &s;o near his end as he was, than death it &s;elf. But he had to do with inexorable men: So he was required to take this oath within two days. And by that time, he not being able to appear before the Council, a Committee of Council was &s;ent to tender him the oath, and to take his examination. He told them, he was not able to &s;peak by rea&s;on of the low &s;tate of his health, which appeared very evidently to them: For he had almo&s;t died while they were with him. He in general prote&s;ted his innocence, and his abhorrence of all de&s;igns again&s;t the King, or the Duke's life: For the other interrogatories, he de&s;ired they might be left with him, and he would con&s;ider them. They per&s;i&s;ted to require him to take his oath: But he as firmly refu&s;ed it. So, upon their report, the Council con&s;trued this refu&s;al to be a confe&s;&s;ion: And fined him 6000 <HI>l.</HI> and ordered him to lie &s;till in pri&s;on till it was paid. After this it was thought that this mat|ter was at an end, and that this was a final &s;entence: But he was &s;till kept &s;hut up, and denied all attendance or a&s;&s;i&s;|tance. He &s;eemed all the while &s;o compo&s;ed, and even &s;o cheerful, that his behaviour looked like the reviving of the &s;pirit of the noble&s;t of the old <HI>Greeks</HI> or <HI>Romans,</HI> or rather of the primitive <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and fir&s;t Martyrs in tho&s;e be&s;t days of the Church. But the Duke was not &s;atisfied with all this. So the Mini&s;try applied their arts to <HI>Tarras,</HI> and the other pri&s;oners, threatning them with all the extremities of mi&s;ery, if they would not witne&s;s trea&s;onable matter again&s;t <HI>Baillie.</HI> They al&s;o practi&s;ed on their wives, and frightning them &s;et them on their hu&s;bands. In conclu&s;ion, they gained what had been &s;o much laboured: <HI>Tarras,</HI> and one <HI>Murray</HI> of <HI>Philip&s;haugh,</HI> did depo&s;e &s;ome di&s;cour&s;es that <HI>Baillie</HI> had with them before he went up to <HI>London,</HI> di&s;po&s;ing them to a rebellion. In the&s;e they &s;welled up the matter beyond
<PB N="587" REF="602">
the truth. Yet all did not amount to a full proof. So the Mini&s;ters, being afraid that a Jury might not be &s;o ea&s;y as they expected, ordered <HI>Car&s;tairs</HI>'s confe&s;&s;ion to be read in Court, not as an evidence, (for that had been promi&s;ed him &s;hould not be done,) but as that which would fully &s;atisfy the Jury, and di&s;po&s;e them to believe the witne&s;&s;es. So <HI>Bail|lie</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">And his ex|ecution.</NOTE> was hurried on to a trial. And upon the evidence he was found guilty, and condemned to be executed that &s;ame day: So afraid they were le&s;t death &s;hould be too quick for them. He was very little di&s;turbed at all this: His langui&s;hing in &s;o &s;olitary a manner made death a very acceptable deliver|ance to him. He in his la&s;t &s;peech &s;hewed, that in &s;everal particulars the witne&s;&s;es had wronged him: He &s;till denied all knowledge of any de&s;ign again&s;t the government: He thought it was lawful for &s;ubjects, being under &s;uch pre&s;&s;ures, to try how they might be relieved from them: And their de&s;ign never went further: But he would enter into no par|ticulars. Thus a learned, and a worthy Gentleman, after twenty months hard u&s;age, was brought to &s;uch a death, in a way &s;o full in all the &s;teps of it of the &s;pirit and prac|tice of the Courts of Inqui&s;ition, that one is tempted to think that the methods taken in it were &s;ugge&s;ted by one well &s;tudied, if not practi&s;ed in them. The only excu&s;e that was ever pretended for this infamous pro&s;ecution was, that they were &s;ure he was guilty; and that the whole &s;ecret of the negotiation between the two Kingdoms was tru&s;ted to him; and that, &s;ince he would not di&s;cover it, all methods might be taken to de&s;troy him: Not con&s;idering what a precedent they made on this occa&s;ion, by which, if men were once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an ill opinion of a man, they were to &s;pare neither artifice nor violence, but to hunt him down by any means. I have been perhaps too long in this particular, but the ca&s;e was &s;o &s;ingular, and my relation to the per&s;on was &s;o near, and my value for him was &s;o great, that I hope I need make no apology for it.</P>
<P>In this I &s;aw how ambition could corrupt one of the be&s;t tempered men that I had ever known: I mean Lord <HI>Perth,</HI> who for above ten years together &s;eemed to me incapable of an immoral or cruel action, and yet was now deeply engaged in the foule&s;t and blacke&s;t of crimes. I had not now &s;een him for two years. But I hoped, that &s;till &s;ome good im|pre&s;&s;ions had been left in him: And now, when he came to <HI>London</HI> to be made Lord Chancellor, I had a very
<PB N="588" REF="603">
earne&s;t me&s;&s;age from him, de&s;iring by my means to &s;ee <HI>Leigh|toun.</HI> I thought, that angelical man might have awaken'd in him &s;ome of tho&s;e good principles which he &s;eemed once to have, and which were now totally extingui&s;hed in him. I writ &s;o earne&s;tly to <HI>Leightoun,</HI> that he came to <HI>London.</HI> Upon his coming to me, I was amazed to &s;ee him at above &s;even|ty look &s;o fre&s;h and well, that age &s;eemed as it were to &s;tand &s;till with him: His hair was &s;till black, and all his motions were lively: He had the &s;ame quickne&s;s of thought, and &s;trength of memory, but above all the &s;ame heat and life of devotion, that I had ever &s;een in him. When I took notice to him upon my fir&s;t &s;eeing him how well he looked, he told me, he was very near his end for all that; and his work and journey both were now almo&s;t done. This at that time made no great impre&s;&s;ion on me. He was the next day taken with an oppre&s;&s;ion, and as it &s;eemed with a cold and with &s;titches, which was indeed a pluri&s;y.</P>
<P>The next day <HI>Leightoun</HI> &s;unk &s;o, that both &s;peech and &s;en&s;e went away of a &s;udden: And he continued panting <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Leightoun</HI>'s death.</NOTE> about twelve hours; and then died without pangs or con|vul&s;ions. I was by him all the while. Thus I lo&s;t him, who had been for &s;o many years the chief guide of my whole life. He had lived ten years in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> in great privacy, dividing his time wholly between &s;tudy and retirement, and the doing of good: For in the pari&s;h where he lived, and in the pari&s;hes round about, he was always employed in preaching, and in reading prayers. He di&s;tributed all he had in charities, choo&s;ing rather to have it go thro' other peo|ple's hand than his own: For I was his almoner in <HI>London.</HI> He had gathered a well cho&s;en library of curious, as well as u&s;eful books; which he left to the Dioce&s;s of <HI>Dunblane,</HI> for the u&s;e of the Clergy there, that Country being ill pro|vided with books. He lamented oft to me the &s;tupidity that he ob&s;erved among the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> who &s;eemed to be much more in&s;en&s;ible in the matters of Religion, than the Commons of <HI>Scotland</HI> were. He retained &s;till a peculiar inclination to <HI>Scotland:</HI> And if he had &s;een any pro&s;pect of doing good there, he would have gone and lived and died among them. In the &s;hort time that the affairs of <HI>Scotland</HI> were in the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s hands, that Duke had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;uch an opinion of him, that he moved the King to write to him, to go, and at lea&s;t live in <HI>Scotland,</HI> if he would not engage in a Bi&s;hoprick there. But that fell with that Duke's credit. He was in his la&s;t years turned to a
<PB N="589" REF="604">
greater &s;everity again&s;t Popery than I had imagined a man of his temper, and of his largene&s;s in point of opinion, was capa|ble of. He &s;poke of the corruptions, of the &s;ecular &s;pirit, and of the cruelty that appeared in that Church, with an extraordi|nary concern; and lamented the &s;hameful advances that we &s;eemed to be making towards Popery. He did this with a tenderne&s;s, and an edge, that I did not expect from &s;o re|clu&s;e and mortified a man. He looked on the State the Church of <HI>England</HI> was in with very melancholy reflections, and was very unea&s;y at an expre&s;&s;ion then much u&s;ed, that it was the be&s;t con&s;tituted Church in the world. He thought it was truly &s;o, with relation to the doctrine, the wor&s;hip, and the main part of our government. But as to the ad|mini&s;tration, both with relation to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts, and the pa&s;toral care, he looked on it as one of the mo&s;t corrupt he had ever &s;een. He thought, we looked like a fair carca&s;e of a body without a &s;pirit; without that zeal, that &s;trictne&s;s of life, and that laboriou&s;ne&s;s in the Clergy, that became us.</P>
<P>There were two remarkable circum&s;tances in his death. He u&s;ed often to &s;ay, that if he were to choo&s;e a place to die in, it &s;hould be an inn; it looking like a Pilgrim's go|ing home, to whom this world was all as an inn, and who was weary of the noi&s;e and confu&s;ion in it. He added, that the officious tenderne&s;s and care of friends was an entanglement to a dying man; and that the unconcerned attendance of tho&s;e that could be procured in &s;uch a place would give le&s;s di&s;turbance. And he obtained what he de&s;ired; for he died at the <HI>Bell</HI> inn in <HI>Warwick-Lane.</HI> Another circum&s;tance was, that while he was Bi&s;hop in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he took what his te|nants were plea&s;ed to pay him: So that there was a great arrear due, which was rai&s;ed &s;lowly by one whom he left in tru&s;t with his affairs there: And the la&s;t payment that he could expect from thence was returned up to him about &s;ix weeks before his death: So that his provi&s;ion and journey failed both at once. And thus in the &s;everal parts of this hi&s;tory I have given a very particular account of every thing relating to this apo&s;tolical man; who&s;e life I would have writ, if I had not found proper places to bring the mo&s;t material parts of it within this work. I reckon, that I owed this to that perfect friend&s;hip and fatherly care with which he had always treated me.</P>
<P>The mentioning his death leads me to name &s;ome other <NOTE PLACE="marg">The promo|tion of &s;ome Bi&s;hops.</NOTE> Clergymen of note, that died in this and in the former
<PB N="590" REF="605">
year. <HI>Burnet</HI> died in <HI>Scotland.</HI> And <HI>Ro&s;s,</HI> a poor, ignorant, worthle&s;s man, but in whom obedience and fury were &s;o eminent, that the&s;e &s;upplied all other defects, was rai&s;ed to be the Primate of that Church: Which was indeed a &s;ad omen, as well as a &s;tep to its fall and ruin. <HI>Stearn,</HI> Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> died in the eighty &s;ixth year of his age: He was a &s;our ill tempered man, and minded chiefly the enriching his family. He was &s;u&s;pected of Popery, becau&s;e he was more than ordinarily compliant in all things to the Court, and was very zealous for the Duke. <HI>Dolben,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> &s;ucceeded him, a man of more &s;pirit than di&s;cre|tion, and an excellent preacher, but of a free conver&s;ation, which laid him open to much cen&s;ure in a vitious Court. And indeed he proved a much better Archbi&s;hop than he had been a Bi&s;hop. <HI>Gunning</HI> of <HI>Ely</HI> died this &s;ummer, a man of great reading: He had in him all the &s;ubtilty, and the di&s;puting humour of a &s;choolman: And he &s;tudied to infu&s;e that into all tho&s;e who were formed by him. He was &s;trict in the whole cour&s;e of his life: But was a dry man, and much inclined to &s;uper&s;tition. He had a great confu&s;ion of things in his head, and could bring nothing into method: So that he was a dark and perplexed preacher. His &s;ermons were full of <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew,</HI> and of the opinions of the Fathers. Yet many of the Ladies of a high form loved to hear him preach: Which the King u&s;ed to &s;ay, was becau&s;e they did not under&s;tand him. <HI>Turner</HI> &s;ucceeded him. He had been long in the Duke's family, and was in high favour with him. He was a &s;incere and good natured man, of too quick an imagination, and too defective a judgment. He was but moderately learned, having conver&s;ed more with men than with books: And &s;o he was not able to do the Duke great &s;ervice. But he was &s;o zealous for his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that this rai&s;ed him high upon no great &s;tock of &s;ufficiency. Old <HI>Morley,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> died this winter, in the eighty &s;eventh year of his age. He was in many re&s;pects a very eminent man, zealous again&s;t Popery, and yet a great enemy to the Di&s;&s;enters: He was con&s;iderably learned, and had a great vivacity of thought: But he was too &s;oon pro|voked, and too little ma&s;ter of him&s;elf upon tho&s;e occa&s;ions. <HI>Mew,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> &s;ucceeded him: He had been a Captain during the wars, and had been <HI>Middletoun</HI>'s Secretary, when he was &s;ent to command the in&s;urrection that the <HI>Highlanders</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> made for the King in fifty three. After that he came into Orders: And, tho' he knew
<PB N="591" REF="606">
very little of Divinity, or of any other learning, and was weak to a childi&s;h degree, yet ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s and zeal rai&s;ed him thro' &s;everal &s;teps to this great See. <HI>Ken</HI> &s;ucceeded him in <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells;</HI> a man of an a&s;cetick cour&s;e of life, and yet of a very lively temper, but too hot and &s;udden. He had a very edifying way of preaching: But it was more apt to move the pa&s;&s;ions, than to in&s;truct. So that his &s;ermons were rather beautiful than &s;olid: Yet his way in them was very taking. The King &s;eemed fond of him. And by him and <HI>Turner</HI> the Papi&s;ts hoped, that great progre&s;s might be made in gaining, or at lea&s;t deluding the Clergy. It was ob&s;erved, that all the men in favour among the Clergy were unmarried; from whom, they hoped, they might more probably promi&s;e them&s;elves a di&s;po&s;ition to come over to them.</P>
<P>The pro&s;ecution of the Di&s;&s;enters was carried very high <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Danby</HI> and the Popi&s;h Lords bailed.</NOTE> all this year: They were not only proceeded again&s;t for go|ing to Conventicles, but for not going to Church, and for not receiving the Sacrament; the laws made again&s;t Papi&s;ts with relation to tho&s;e particulars being now applied to them. Many were excommunicated, and ruined by the pro&s;ecutions. The Earl of <HI>Danby,</HI> for all his &s;everity again&s;t Lord <HI>Shafts|bury</HI> for moving in the King's bench to be bailed, tho' com|mitted by the Lords only for contempt, yet had been forc|ed to move often for his being let out upon bail. It was certainly a very great hard&s;hip that he lay under: For he had been now five years in the Tower. And three Parlia|ments had &s;at. The two la&s;t had not mentioned him. And now a Parliament &s;eemed out of &s;ight. Yet, tho' he offer|ed a very long and learned argument for their bailing him, the Judges of the King's bench, even <HI>Sanders</HI> him&s;elf, were afraid to meddle in it. But <HI>Jefferies</HI> was bolder. So he bailed him. And upon the &s;ame grounds all the Popi&s;h Lords were al&s;o bailed. <HI>Oates</HI> was pro&s;ecuted at the Duke's &s;uit for &s;can|dalous words: Rogue and traitor were very freely be&s;towed on the Duke by him: So an 100000 <HI>l.</HI> was given, which &s;hut him up in a perpetual impri&s;onment, till they &s;aw a fit op|portunity to carry matters further again&s;t him. The Duke of <HI>Beaufort,</HI> Lord <HI>Peterborough,</HI> and &s;ome others, brought actions of <HI>Scandalum Magnatum</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e who in the time of our great heat had &s;poke foul things of them: And great damages were given by ob&s;equious and zealous Juries. An information of a higher nature was brought again&s;t <HI>Wil|liams,</HI> who, tho' he was a worthle&s;s man, yet was for his
<PB N="592" REF="607">
zeal cho&s;en Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons in the two la&s;t Parliaments. He had licen&s;ed the printing the Votes, which had in them matters of &s;candal relating to &s;ome Lords. So an information was brought again&s;t him: And he upon it demurred to the juri&s;diction of the Court. This was driven on purpo&s;e by the Duke's party, to cut off the thoughts of another Parliament; &s;ince it was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that any Hou&s;e of Commons could bear the puni&s;hing the Speaker for obeying their orders.</P>
<P><HI>Jenkins</HI> had now done all the drudgery that the Court had occa&s;ion for from him: And being capable to &s;erve them in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some re|moves made at Court.</NOTE> nothing el&s;e, he was di&s;mi&s;t from being Secretary of State: And <HI>Godolphin,</HI> one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury, &s;ucceeded him. Another Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury, <HI>Deer|ing,</HI> dying at the &s;ame time, the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> hoped to have been made Lord Trea&s;urer. He had lo&s;t much ground with the King. And the whole Court hated him, by rea&s;on of the &s;top of all payments, which was chiefly imputed to him. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> and Lord <HI>North</HI> joined their intere&s;t to bring in two other Commi&s;&s;ioners upon him, without &s;o much as letting him know of it, till it was re&s;olved on. The&s;e were <HI>Thynn</HI> and <HI>North.</HI> This la&s;t was to be rewarded for his &s;er|vice during his Shrievalry in <HI>London.</HI> Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> engaged both the Duke and the Lady <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> to divert this, if it was po&s;&s;ible. But the King was not to be &s;haken. So he re|&s;olved to quit the Trea&s;ury. The Earl of <HI>Radnor</HI> was di&s;charged from being Lord Pre&s;ident of the Council, where he had for &s;ome years acted a very mean part, in which he had lo&s;t the character of a &s;teady, cynical, <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> which he had maintained in the former cour&s;e of his life. And Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> was made Lord Pre&s;ident: Which being a po&s;t &s;uperior in rank, but much inferior both in advantage and credit to that he held formerly, drew a je&s;t from Lord <HI>Ha|lifax</HI> that may be worth remembring: He &s;aid, he had heard of many kicked down &s;tairs, but never of any that was kickt up &s;tairs before. <HI>Godolphin</HI> was weary of the drudgery that lay on a Secretary of State. He cho&s;e rather to be the fir&s;t Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury. And he was made a Baron. The Earl of <HI>Middletoun,</HI> &s;on to him that had governed <HI>Scot|land,</HI> was made Secretary of State, a man of a generous tem|per, but without much religion, well learned, of a good judgment, and a lively apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>If foreign affairs could have awaken'd the King, the <HI>French</HI> did enough this &s;ummer in order to it. Be&s;ides their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing <NOTE PLACE="marg">The bom|barding of <HI>Genoa</HI></NOTE>

them&s;elves of <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> they &s;ent a fleet again&s;t <HI>Genoa</HI> upon no &s;ort of provocation, but becau&s;e <HI>Genoa</HI> would not comply with &s;ome demands, that were both unju&s;t and unrea&s;onable: The King of <HI>France</HI> ordered it to be bombard|ed, hoping that in that confu&s;ion he might by landing a few men have made him&s;elf ea&s;ily ma&s;ter of that State. This would very probably have &s;ucceeded, if the attempt had been made upon the fir&s;t con&s;ternation they were in, when the bombardment began. But the thing was delayed a day or two. And by that time the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> not only re|covered them&s;elves out of their fir&s;t fright; but putting them|&s;elves in order, they were animated with that indignation and fury that they beat off the <HI>French</HI> with a courage that was not expected from them. Such an a&s;&s;ault, that looked liker the violence of a robber, than the attack of one that would ob&s;erve forms in his conque&s;ts, ought to have provoked all Princes, e&s;pecially &s;uch as were powerful at &s;ea, to have joined again&s;t a Prince, who by the&s;e practices was become the common enemy of mankind. But we were now pur&s;uing other de&s;igns, from which it was re&s;olved that nothing from beyond &s;ea &s;hould divert us.</P>
<P>After the King had kept <HI>Tangier</HI> about twenty years, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tangier</HI> abandoned.</NOTE> had been at a va&s;t charge in making a mole before it, in which &s;everal &s;ets of undertakers had failed indeed in the main de&s;igns, but had &s;ucceeded well in the enriching of them&s;elves, and the work was now brought near perfecti|on, which &s;eemed to give us the key of the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> He, to deliver him&s;elf from that charge, &s;ent Lord <HI>Dartmouth</HI> with a fleet to de&s;troy all the works, and to bring home all our men. The King, when he communicated this to the Cabinet Council, charged them to be &s;ecret. But it was believed, that he him&s;elf &s;poke of it to the Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> and that Lord <HI>Arlington</HI> told it to the <HI>Portugal</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador: For the Amba&s;&s;ador took fire upon it; and de&s;ired, that, if the King was weary of keeping it, he would re&s;tore it to his Ma&s;ter: And he undertook to pay a great &s;um for the charge the King had been at, all the&s;e years that he had it. But the King believed, that as the money would never be paid, &s;o the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> would not be able to main|tain that place again&s;t the <HI>Moors:</HI> So that it would fall in their hands, and by that means prove too important to com|mand the Straits. The thing was boldly denied by the Mi|ni&s;ters, when pre&s;&s;ed by the Amba&s;&s;ador upon the &s;ubject. Lord <HI>Dartmouth</HI> executed the de&s;ign as he was ordered. So
<PB N="594" REF="609">
an end was put to our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that place. This was done only to &s;ave charge, that the Court might hold out the longer without a Parliament. So the Republick of <HI>Genoa,</HI> &s;eeing that we would not, and that without us the <HI>Dutch</HI> could not undertake their protection, were forced to make a very abject compliment to the King of <HI>France;</HI> if any thing could be abject, that was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ave their Country. The Doge and &s;ome of the Senators were &s;ent to <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> to a&s;k the King pardon, tho' it was not ea&s;y to tell for what; un|le&s;s it was, becau&s;e they pre&s;umed to re&s;i&s;t his inva&s;ion. I hapned to be at <HI>Paris</HI> when the Doge was there. One &s;ay|ing of his was much repeated: When all the glory of <HI>Ver|&s;ailles</HI> was &s;et open to him, and the flatterers of the Court were admiring every thing, he &s;eemed to look at them with the coldne&s;s that became a per&s;on who was at the head of a free Common Wealth: And when he was a&s;ked, if the things he &s;aw were not very extraordinary, he &s;aid, the mo&s;t extraordinary thing that he &s;aw was, that he &s;aw him|&s;elf there.</P>
<P>The affairs of <HI>Holland</HI> were much broken: The Prince of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs be|yond &s;ea.</NOTE> <HI>Orange</HI> and the Town of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> were in very ill terms by the <HI>French</HI> management, to which <HI>Chudleigh</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Envoy joined his &s;trength, to &s;uch a degree of in&s;olence, that he offered per&s;onal affronts to the Prince; who upon that would &s;ee him no more: Yet the Prince was not con|&s;idered enough at our Court to get <HI>Chudleigh</HI> to be recalled upon it. The Town of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> went &s;o far, that a mo|tion was made of &s;etting up the Prince of <HI>Friezeland</HI> as their Statholder: And he was invited to come to their Town in order to it. But the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> prevented this by coming to a full agreement with that Town. So he and his Prince&s;s were invited thither: And that mi&s;under&s;tanding was removed, or at lea&s;t laid a&s;leep for that time. The war of <HI>Hungary</HI> went on with &s;low &s;ucce&s;s on the Emperor's &s;ide: He was poor, and his revenue was exhau&s;ted, &s;o that he could not pre&s;s &s;o hard upon the <HI>Turks,</HI> as he might have done with advantage; for they were in great confu&s;ion. The King of <HI>Poland</HI> had married a <HI>French</HI> wife: And &s;he had a great a&s;cendant over him: And not being able to get her family rai&s;ed in <HI>France,</HI> &s;he had turned that King to the Emperor's intere&s;ts. So that he had the glory of rai&s;ing the &s;iege of <HI>Vienna.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> &s;aw their error; and were now ready to purcha&s;e her at any rate: So that all the re&s;t of that poor King's inglorious life, after that great action at
<PB N="595" REF="610">
<HI>Vienna,</HI> was a perpetual going backwards and forwards be|tween the intere&s;ts of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Vienna;</HI> which depended entirely upon the &s;ecret negotiations of the Court of <HI>France</HI> with his Queen, as they came to her terms, or as they did not qu$$e comply with them.</P>
<P>The mi&s;under&s;tanding between the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>France</HI> went on &s;till. The Pope declared openly for the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Turk;</HI> and made great returns of money into <HI>Germany.</HI> He engaged the <HI>Venetians</HI> into the alliance. He found al&s;o fault with many of the proceedings in <HI>France,</HI> with relation to the Regale. And now the tables were turned: The <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> who were wont to value them|&s;elves on their dependance on the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> were now wholly in the intere&s;ts of <HI>France;</HI> for they re&s;olved to be on the &s;tronger &s;ide: And the <HI>Jan&s;eni&s;ts,</HI> whom <HI>Rome</HI> had treat|ed very ill, and who were looked on as the mo&s;t zealous a&s;&s;ertors of the liberties of the <HI>Gallican</HI> Church, were now the men that admired the Pope, and declared for him. The per&s;ecution of the Prote&s;tants went on &s;till in <HI>France:</HI> And no other care was had of them here, but that we &s;heltred them, and &s;o had great numbers of them coming over to us. A quarrel was in debate between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t-India</HI> company. The <HI>Dutch</HI> had a mind to drive us out of <HI>Bantam;</HI> for they did not love to &s;ee the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ettle &s;o near <HI>Batavia.</HI> So they engaged the old King of <HI>Bantam</HI> into a war with his &s;on, who was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Bantam:</HI> And the &s;on was &s;upported by the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> But the old King drove out his &s;on by the help that the <HI>Dutch</HI> gave him: And he drove out the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> likewi&s;e, as having e&s;pou&s;ed his &s;on's rebellion again&s;t him; tho' we under&s;tood it, that he had re&s;igned the Kingdom to his &s;on, but that by the in&s;tigation of the <HI>Dutch</HI> he had now invaded him. It is certain, our Court laid up this in their heart, as that upon which they would lay the foundation of a new war with the States, as &s;oon as we &s;hould be in condition to under|take it. The <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> company &s;aw this, and that the Court pre&s;&s;ed them to make publick remon&s;trances upon it, which gave a jealou&s;y of an ill de&s;ign under it: So they re|&s;olved to proceed rather in a very &s;low negotiation, than in any thing that might give a handle to a rupture.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now mix in &s;omewhat with relation to my &s;elf, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The ha$span$|&s;h$span$ that $span$ w$$.</NOTE> tho' that may &s;eem too incon&s;iderable to be put into a &s;eries of matters of &s;uch importance. But it is nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome account of that which &s;et me at liberty to go round &s;ome
<PB N="596" REF="611">
parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and to &s;tay for &s;ome years out of <HI>England.</HI> I preached a lecture at St. <HI>Clements</HI> on the <HI>Thur&s;days:</HI> But after the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s death the King &s;ent an order to Dr. <HI>Ha&s;card,</HI> then Rector of the pari&s;h, to di&s;charge me from it. I continued at the Rolls, avoiding very cautiou&s;ly every thing that related to the publick: For I abhorred the mak|ing the pulpit a &s;tage for venting of pa&s;&s;ion, or for the &s;erv|ing of intere&s;ts. There was a pari&s;h in <HI>London</HI> vacant, where the election lay in the inhabitants: And it was probable it would have fallen on me; tho' <HI>London</HI> was in &s;o divided a &s;tate, that every thing was managed by the &s;trength of par|ties. Yet the King, apprehending the choice might have fallen on me, &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to them, to let them know, he would take it ami&s;s if they cho&s;e me. Old Sir <HI>Harbotle Grim&s;tone</HI> lived &s;till to the great indignation of the Court: When the fifth of <HI>November,</HI> being gunpowder trea&s;on day, came, in which we had always &s;ermons at the Chapel of the Rolls, I beg'd the Ma&s;ter of the Rolls to excu&s;e me then from preaching; for that day led one to preach again&s;t Popery, and it was indecent not to do it. He &s;aid, he would end his life as he had led it all along, in an open dete&s;tation of Popery. So, &s;ince I &s;aw this could not be avoided, tho' I had not meddled with any point of Popery for above a year together, I re&s;olved, &s;ince I did it &s;o &s;eldom, to do it to purpo&s;e. I cho&s;e for my text the&s;e words: <HI>Save me from the lion</HI>'s <HI>mouth, thou ha&s;t heard me from the horns of the unicorns.</HI> I made no reflection in my thoughts on the lion and unicorn, as being the two &s;upporters of the King's &s;cutcheon: (For I ever hated all points of that &s;ort, as a profanation of Scriptures:) But I &s;hewed how well Popery might be compared to the lion's mouth, then open to de|vour us: And I compared our former deliverance from the extremities of danger to the being on the horn of a rhino|ceros. And this leading me to the &s;ubject of the day, I men|tioned that wi&s;h of King <HI>James</HI> the fir&s;t again&s;t any of his po&s;terity that &s;hould endeavour to bring that religion in among us. This was immediately carried to the Court. But it only rai&s;ed more anger again&s;t me; for nothing could be made of it. They talked mo&s;t of the choice of the text, as levelled again&s;t the King's coat of arms. That had never been once in my thoughts. Lord Keeper <HI>North</HI> diverted the King from doing any thing on the account of my &s;ermon. And &s;o the matter &s;lept till the end of the term. And then <HI>North</HI> writ to the Ma&s;ter of the Rolls, that the King con&s;i|dered
<PB N="597" REF="612">
the Chapel of the Rolls as one of his own Chapels: And, &s;ince he looked on me as a per&s;on di&s;affected to his go|vernment, and had for that rea&s;on di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me from his own &s;ervice, he therefore required him not to &s;uffer me to &s;erve any longer in that Chapel. And thus all my &s;ervice in the Church was now &s;topt. For upon &s;uch a publick declara|tion made again&s;t me, it was not fit for any Clergyman to make u&s;e of my a&s;&s;i&s;tance any more. And by the&s;e means I was &s;et at liberty by the procurement of my enemies. So that I did not abandon my po&s;t, either out of fear, or out of any giddine&s;s to ramble about <HI>Europe.</HI> But, being now un|der &s;uch publick marks of jealou&s;y, and put out of a capa|city of &s;erving God and the Church in the way of my func|tion, it &s;eemed a prudent and a decent thing for me to with|draw my &s;elf from that fury, which I &s;aw was working &s;o &s;trongly, and in &s;o many repeated in&s;tances, again&s;t me.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;graces from the Court were the occa&s;ion of my going out of <HI>England;</HI> which both pre&s;erved me from what I had rea&s;on to apprehend, when the Duke, by the change that hapned &s;oon after, might have had it in his power to make me feel all that di&s;plea&s;ure, which had been growing upon him in a cour&s;e of &s;o many years again&s;t me; and it al&s;o put me in a way to do the greate&s;t &s;ervices I was capable of, both to the intere&s;t of religion, and of the&s;e Nations. So that what was intended as a mi&s;chief to me proved my pre&s;erva|tion. My employment at the Rolls would have fallen in cour&s;e within a month, if the Court had delayed the put|ting me from it in &s;uch an open manner; for that worthy man, Sir <HI>Harbotle Grim&s;tone,</HI> died about <HI>Chri&s;tmas.</HI> Nature &s;unk all at once, he being then eighty two: He died, as he had lived, with great piety and re&s;ignation to the will of God.</P>
<P>There were two famous trials in <HI>Michaelmas</HI> term: Three <NOTE PLACE="marg">Trials for trea&s;on of <HI>Ro&s;well</HI> and <HI>Haies.</HI></NOTE> women came and depo&s;ed again&s;t <HI>Ro&s;well,</HI> a Pre&s;byterian preacher, trea&s;onable words that he had delivered at a Con|venticle. They &s;wore to two or three periods, in which they agreed &s;o exactly together, that there was not the &s;malle&s;t variation in their depo&s;itions. <HI>Ro&s;well</HI> on the other hand made a &s;trong defence: He proved, that the witne&s;&s;es were leud and infamous per&s;ons. He proved, that he had always been a loyal man, even in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s days; that he prayed con&s;tantly for the King in his family, and that in his &s;er|mons he often in&s;i&s;ted on the obligations to loyalty. And as for that &s;ermon, in which the witne&s;&s;es &s;wore he deli|vered
<PB N="598" REF="613">
tho&s;e words, he &s;hewed what his text was, which the witne&s;&s;es could not remember, as they remembred nothing el&s;e in his &s;ermon be&s;ides the words they had depo&s;ed. That text, and his &s;ermon upon it, had no relation to any &s;uch matter. Several witne&s;&s;es who heard the &s;ermon, and &s;ome who writ it in &s;hort hand, declared, he &s;aid no &s;uch words, nor any thing to that purpo&s;e. He offered his own notes to prove this further: But no regard was had to them. The women could not prove by any circum&s;tance that they were at his meeting; or that any per&s;on &s;aw them there on that day. The words they &s;wore again&s;t him were &s;o gro&s;s, that it was not to be imagined any man in his wits could ex|pre&s;s him&s;elf &s;o, were he ever &s;o wickedly &s;et, before a mix|ed a&s;&s;embly. It was al&s;o urged, that it was highly impro|bable, that three women could remember &s;o long a period upon one &s;ingle hearing; and that they &s;hould all remember it &s;o exactly, as to agree in the &s;ame depo&s;ition. He of|fered to put the whole upon this i&s;&s;ue: He would pro|nounce a period, as long as that which they had &s;worn, with his u&s;ual tone of voice with which he preached, and then leave it to them to repeat it, if they could. I &s;et down all this defence more particularly, that it may appear what a &s;pirit was in that time, when a verdict could be brought in upon &s;uch an evidence, and again&s;t &s;uch a defence. <HI>Jefferies</HI> urged the matter with his ordinary vehemence: He laid it for a foundation, that all preaching at Conventicles was trea|&s;onable, and that this ought to di&s;po&s;e the Jury to believe any evidence what&s;oever upon that head, and that here were three po&s;itive concurring witne&s;&s;es: So the Jury brought him in guilty. And there was a &s;hameful rejoycing upon this. It was thought, now Conventicles would be all &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by it; &s;ince any per&s;on that would witne&s;s that trea&s;onable words were delivered at them would be believed, how improbable &s;oever it might be. But when the importance of the words came to be examined, by men learned in the law, they were found not to be trea&s;on by any &s;tatute. So <HI>Ro&s;well</HI> moved for an arre&s;t of judgment, till Coun&s;el &s;hould be heard to that point, whether the words were trea&s;on, or not. In <HI>Sid|ney</HI>'s ca&s;e they refu&s;ed to grant that, unle&s;s he would fir&s;t confe&s;s the fact. And, tho' that was much cen&s;ured, yet it was more doubtful, whether Council ought to be heard after the Jury had brought in the verdict. But the King was &s;o put out of countenance with the many &s;tories that were brought him of his witne&s;&s;es, that the Attorney General had
<PB N="599" REF="614">
orders to yield to the arre&s;t of judgment; tho' it had been more to the King's honour to have put an end to the bu&s;i|ne&s;s by a pardon. It was thought a good point gained, which might turn to the advantage of the &s;ubject, to allow that a point of law might be argued after conviction. The impu|dence of this verdict was the more &s;hameful, &s;ince, tho' we had a Popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or in view, here was a precedent made, by which po&s;itive witne&s;&s;es, &s;wearing to any thing as &s;aid in a &s;ermon, were to be believed again&s;t &s;o many probabilities, and &s;o much proof to the contrary; which might have been at another time very fatal to the Clergy.</P>
<P>The other trial was of more importance to the Court. In <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI>'s pocket, when he was taken, a letter was found writ by <HI>Haies,</HI> a Banquier in <HI>London,</HI> directed to another name, which was believed a feigned one: In it credit was given him upon <HI>Haies</HI>'s corre&s;pondent in <HI>Holland</HI> for money: He was de&s;ired not to be too lavi&s;h: And he was promi&s;ed, that he &s;hould be &s;upplied as he needed it. Here was an abetting of a man outlawed for trea&s;on. Much pains was taken on <HI>Haies,</HI> both by per&s;ua&s;ion and threatning, to induce him to di&s;cover that whole cabal of men, that, it &s;eemed, joined in a common pur&s;e to &s;upply tho&s;e who had fled be|yond &s;ea on the account of the plot. And they hoped to know all <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s friends; and either to have attainted them, or at lea&s;t to have fined them &s;everely for it. But <HI>Haies</HI> &s;hewed a fidelity and courage far beyond what could have been expected from &s;uch a man: So he was brought to a trial. He made a &s;trong defence. The letter was not exactly like his hand. It was not addre&s;&s;ed to <HI>Arm&s;trong,</HI> but to another per&s;on, from whom he perhaps had it. No entry was made of it in his books, nor of any &s;um paid in upon it. But his main defence was, that a Banquier ex|amined into no per&s;on's concerns; and therefore, when money or good &s;ecurity was brought him, he gave bills of exchange, or letters of credit, as they were de&s;ired. <HI>Jefferies</HI> pre&s;&s;ed the Jury, in his impetuous way, to find <HI>Haies</HI> guilty of high trea&s;on; becau&s;e, tho' there was not a witne&s;s again&s;t <HI>Haies,</HI> but only pre&s;umptions appeared upon the proof, yet, <HI>Jef|feries</HI> &s;aid, it was proved by two witne&s;&s;es that the letter was found in <HI>Arm&s;trong</HI>'s pocket; and that was &s;ufficient, the re&s;t appearing by circum&s;tances. The little difference between the writing in the letter and his ordinary hand, was &s;aid to be only a feint to hide it, which made him the more guilty. He required the Jury to bring him in guilty: And
<PB N="600" REF="615">
&s;aid, that the King's life and &s;afety depended upon this trial: So that if they did it not, they expo&s;ed the King to a new <HI>Rye-Plot;</HI> with other extravagancies, with which his fury prompted him. But a Jury of merchants could not be wrought up to this pitch. So he was acquitted, which mor|tified the Court a little: For they had reckoned, that now Juries were to be only a point of form in a trial, and that they were always to find bills as they were directed.</P>
<P>A trial in a matter of blood came on after this. A Gen|tleman of a noble family being at a publick &s;upper with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange practices, and very un|becoming a King.</NOTE> much company, &s;ome hot words pa&s;t between him and an|other Gentleman, which rai&s;ed a &s;udden quarrel, none but three per&s;ons being engaged in it. Swords were drawn, and one was killed out-right: But it was not certain by who&s;e hand he was killed: So the other two were both indited up|on it. The proof did not carry it beyond man&s;laughter, no marks of any precedent malice appearing. Yet the young Gentleman was prevailed on to confe&s;s the indictment, and to let &s;entence pa&s;s on him for murder; a pardon being pro|mi&s;ed him if he &s;hould do &s;o, and he being threatned with the utmo&s;t rigour of the law if he &s;tood upon his defence. After the &s;entence had pa&s;t, it appeared on what de&s;ign he had been practi&s;ed on. It was a rich family, and not well af|fected to the Court: So he was told that he mu&s;t pay well for his pardon: And it co&s;t him 16000 <HI>l;</HI> of which the King had the one half, the other half being divided between two Ladies that were in great favour. It is a very ill thing for Princes to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be prevailed on by importu|nities to pardon blood, which cries for vengeance. Yet an ea&s;ine&s;s to importunity is a feeblene&s;s of good nature, and &s;o is in it &s;elf le&s;s criminal. But it is a mon&s;trous per|verting of ju&s;tice, and a de&s;troying the chief end of govern|ment, which is the pre&s;ervation of the people, when their blood is &s;et to &s;ale; and that not as a compen&s;ation to the family of the per&s;on murdered, but to the Prince him&s;elf, and to &s;ome who are in favour with him upon unworthy ac|counts: And it was robbery if the Gentleman was innocent.</P>
<P>Another thing of a &s;trange nature hapned about this time. The Earl of <HI>Clancarty</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> when he died, had left his Lady the guardian of his children. It was one of the no|ble&s;t and riche&s;t families of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Nation, which had al|ways been Papi&s;ts. But the Lady was a Prote&s;tant. And &s;he, being afraid to tru&s;t the education of her &s;on to <HI>Ire|land,</HI> tho' in Prote&s;tant hands, con&s;idering the danger he
<PB N="601" REF="616">
might be in from his kindred of that religion, brought him over to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and put him in <HI>Fell</HI>'s hands, who was both Bi&s;hop of <HI>Oxford</HI> and Dean of Chri&s;t Church; where &s;he reckoned he would be &s;afe. Lord <HI>Clancarty</HI> had an uncle, Coll. <HI>Maccarty,</HI> who was in mo&s;t things, where his religion was not concerned, a man of honour. So he, both to per|vert his nephew, and to make his own court, got the King to write to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Oxford</HI> to let the young Lord come up, and &s;ee the diver&s;ions of the Town in the <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> time; to which the Bi&s;hop did too ea&s;ily con&s;ent. When he came to Town, he, being then at the age of con&s;ent, was mar|ried to one of the Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI>'s daughter. And &s;o he broke thro' all his education, and &s;oon after turned Papi&s;t. Thus the King &s;uffered him&s;elf to be made an in&s;trument in one of the greate&s;t of crimes, the taking an infant out of the hand of a guardian, and marrying him &s;ecretly; again&s;t which the laws of all nations have taken care to provide very effectually. But this leads me into a further view of the de&s;igns at Court.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> grew weary of the in&s;ignificant place <NOTE PLACE="marg">Papi&s;ts em|ployed in <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> of Pre&s;ident, which procured him neither confidence nor de|pendance. And, &s;ince the government of <HI>Ireland</HI> was the greate&s;t po&s;t next to the Trea&s;ury, he obtained by the Duke's favour to be named Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland.</HI> The King &s;eemed to be &s;o unea&s;y with him, that he was glad to &s;end him away from the Court. And the King intended to begin in his per&s;on a new method in the government of <HI>Ireland.</HI> For|merly the Lords Lieutenants were Generals of the army, as well as the Governors of the Kingdom. Their intere&s;t in recommending to po&s;ts in the army, and the giving the commi&s;&s;ions for them, brought the army into their depen|dance, and encrea&s;ed the profits of their Secretaries. It was now &s;ugge&s;ted by Lord <HI>Sunderland,</HI> that this was too much in one per&s;on: And therefore he propo&s;ed, that there &s;hould be a General of the army, independent on the Lord Lieu|tenant, and who &s;hould be a check upon him: When there were but a few troops kept up there, it might be more rea|&s;onable to leave them in the Lord Lieutenant's hands: But now that an army was kept, it &s;eemed too much to put that, as well as the civil admini&s;tration of the Kingdom, into the power of one man. In this the Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI>'s de|&s;ign was, to keep that Kingdom in a dependance upon him&s;elf. And he told the King, that if he thought that was a good
<PB N="602" REF="617">
maxim for the government of <HI>Ireland,</HI> he ought to begin it when a creature of his own was &s;ent thither, who had not &s;uch a right to di&s;pute points of that kind with him, as an|cient noblemen might pretend to. Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> was much mortified with this. He &s;aid, the chief Governor of <HI>Ireland</HI> could not be an&s;werable for the peace of that Kingdom, if the army was not in a dependance on him. Yet little re|gard was had to all that he could object to this new me|thod; for the King &s;eemed to be the more plea&s;ed with it, becau&s;e it afflicted him &s;o much. The fir&s;t in&s;tance, in which the King intended to begin the immediate dependance of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> army on him&s;elf, was not &s;o well cho&s;en, as to make it generally acceptable: For it was, that Coll. <HI>Maccarty</HI> was to have a regiment there. He had a regiment in the <HI>French</HI> &s;ervice for &s;everal years, and was called home upon that ap|pearance that we had put on of engaging with the allies in a war with <HI>France</HI> in the year 1678. The Popi&s;h plot had kept the King from employing him for &s;ome years, in which the Court was in &s;ome management with the Nation. But now that being at an end, the King intended to employ him, upon this ac|ceptable &s;ervice he had done with relation to his nephew. The King &s;poke of it to Lord <HI>Halifax:</HI> And he, as he told me, a&s;ked the King, if he thought that was to govern ac|cording to law. The King an&s;wered, he was not tied up by the laws of <HI>Ireland,</HI> as he was by the laws of <HI>England.</HI> Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> offered to argue that point with any per&s;on that a&s;&s;erted it before him: He &s;aid, that army was rai&s;ed by a Prote&s;tant Parliament, to &s;ecure the Prote&s;tant intere&s;t: And would the King give occa&s;ion to any to &s;ay, that where his hands were not bound up, he would &s;hew all the favour he could to the Papi&s;ts? The King an&s;wered, he did not trouble him&s;elf with what people &s;aid, or would &s;ay. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> replied to this, that it was a ju&s;t piece of greatne&s;s in the King not to mind what his enemies &s;aid; but he hoped he would never de&s;pi&s;e what his friends &s;aid, e&s;pecially when they &s;eemed to have rea&s;on on their &s;ide: And he wi&s;hed the King would choo&s;e rather to make up <HI>Maccarty</HI>'s lo&s;&s;es for his &s;ervice in pen&s;ions, and other favours, than in a way that would rai&s;e &s;o much clamour and jealou&s;y. In all this Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> only offered his advice to the King, up|on the King's beginning the di&s;cour&s;e with him. Yet the King told it all to <HI>Maccarty;</HI> who came and expo&s;tulated the matter with that Lord. So he &s;aw by that how little &s;afe a
<PB N="603" REF="618">
man was, who &s;poke freely to the King, when he cro&s;&s;ed the King's own inclinations.</P>
<P>There was a great expectation in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Su&s;picions of the King's declaring him&s;elf a Papi&s;t.</NOTE> that at this time the King would declare him&s;elf a Papi&s;t. They did not keep the &s;ecret very carefully there: For the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Rheims</HI> had &s;aid to my &s;elf, that the King was as much theirs as his brother was, only he had not &s;o much con&s;cience. This I reported to Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> to tell the King. Whether he did it, or not, I know not. But it was written over at this time from <HI>Paris,</HI> that the King of <HI>France</HI> had &s;aid at his levee, or at table, that a great thing would quickly break out in <HI>England</HI> with relati|on to religion. The occa&s;ion of that was afterwards better known. One of our <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> &s;hips had brought over one of the Mi&s;&s;ionaries of <HI>Siam,</HI> who was a man of a warm ima|gination, and who talked of his having converted and bap|tized many thou&s;ands in that Kingdom. He was well received at Court: And the King diverted him&s;elf with hear|ing him relate the adventures, and other pa&s;&s;ages of his tra|vels. Upon this encouragement he de&s;ired a private audience; in which in a very inflamed &s;peech, and with great vehe|mence, he pre&s;&s;ed the King to return into the bo&s;om of the Church. The King entertained this civilly, and gave him tho&s;e an&s;wers, that he, not knowing the King's way, took them for &s;uch &s;teps and indications, as made him con|clude the thing was very near done: And upon that he writ to <HI>P. de la Chai&s;e,</HI> that they would hear the news of the King's conver&s;ion very quickly. The Confe&s;&s;or carried the news to the King; who, not doubting it, gave the ge|neral hint of that great turn, of which he was then full of hopes.</P>
<P>That Prie&s;t was directed by &s;ome to apply him&s;elf to Lord <HI>Halifax,</HI> to try if he could convert him. Lord <HI>Hali|fax</HI> told me, he was &s;o vain and &s;o weak a man, that none could be converted by him, but &s;uch as were weary of their religion, and wanted only a pretence to throw it off. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> put many que&s;tions to him, to which he made &s;uch &s;imple an&s;wers, as furni&s;hed that Lord with many very lively &s;allies upon the conver&s;ions &s;o much boa&s;ted of, as made by &s;uch men. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> a&s;ked him, how it came that, &s;ince the King of <HI>Siam</HI> was &s;o favourable to their religion, they had not converted him? The Mi&s;&s;ionary upon that told him, that the King had &s;aid, he would not examine into the truth of all that they had told him concerning <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
<PB N="604" REF="619">
<HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> He thought it was not rea&s;onable to for&s;ake the re|ligion of his fathers, unle&s;s he &s;aw good grounds to ju&s;|tify the change: And, &s;ince they pretended that the author of their religion had left a power of working miracles with his followers, he de&s;ired they would apply that to him&s;elf: He had a pal&s;ey both in his arm, and in his leg: And if they could deliver him from that, he promi&s;ed to them he would change immediately. Upon which the Mi&s;&s;ionary &s;aid, that the Bi&s;hop, who was the head of that mi&s;&s;ion, was bold enough <HI>(a&s;&s;ez hardi,</HI> were the Prie&s;t's own words) to under|take it. A day was &s;et for it. And the Bi&s;hop, with his Prie&s;t and &s;ome others, came to the King. And after &s;ome prayers, the King told them, he felt &s;ome heat and motion in his arm; but the pal&s;ey was more rooted in his thigh: So he de&s;ired the Bi&s;hop would go on, and fini&s;h that which was &s;o happily begun. The Bi&s;hop thought he had ventured enough, and would engage no further; but told the King, that &s;ince their God had made one &s;tep towards him, he mu&s;t make the next to God, and at lea&s;t meet him half way. But the King was ob&s;tinate, and would have the miracle fini&s;hed before he would change. On the other hand the Bi&s;hop &s;tood his ground. And &s;o the matter went no further. Upon which Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> &s;aid, &s;ince the King was &s;uch an infidel, they ought to have prayed the pal&s;ey into his arm again, as well as they prayed it out: Other|wi&s;e, here was a miracle lo&s;t on an ob&s;tinate infidel: And, if the pal&s;ey had immediately returned into his arm, that would perhaps have given him a full conviction. This put the Mi&s;&s;ionary into &s;ome confu&s;ion. And Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> re|peated it both to the King and to the Duke with that air of contempt, that the Duke was highly provoked by it: And the Prie&s;t appeared at Court no more.</P>
<P>There was at this time a new &s;cheme formed, that very probably would have for ever broken the King and the <NOTE PLACE="marg">1685 A new &s;cheme of government.</NOTE> Duke. But how it was laid was &s;o great a &s;ecret, that I could never penetrate into it. It was laid at Lady <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI>'s. <HI>Barillon</HI> and Lord <HI>Sunderland</HI> were the cehief managers of it. Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> was al&s;o in it. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> came over &s;ecretly. And tho' he did not &s;ee the King, yet he went back very well plea&s;ed with his journey. But he never told his rea&s;on to any that I know of. Mr. <HI>May</HI> of the privy pur&s;e told me, that he was told there was a de&s;ign to break out, with which he him&s;elf would be well plea&s;ed: And when it was ripe, he was to be called on to come and manage
<PB N="605" REF="620">
the King's temper, which no man under&s;tood better than he did; for he had been bred about the King ever &s;ince he was a child: And by his po&s;t he was in the &s;ecret of all his amours; but was contrary to his notions in every thing el&s;e, both with relation to Popery, to <HI>France,</HI> and to arbitrary government. Yet he was &s;o true to the King in that leud confidence in which he employed him, that the King had charged him never to pre&s;s him in any thing &s;o as to provoke him. By this means he kept all this while much at a di&s;|tance; for he would not enter into any di&s;cour&s;e with the King on matters of &s;tate, till the King began with him. And he told me, he knew by the King's way things were not yet quite ripe, nor he thoroughly fixed on the de&s;ign. That with which they were to begin was, the &s;ending the Duke to <HI>Scotland.</HI> And it was generally believed, that if the two brothers &s;hould be once parted, they would never meet again. The King &s;poke to the Duke concerning his going to <HI>Scotland:</HI> And he an&s;wered, that there was no occa&s;ion for it: Upon which the King replied, that either the Duke mu&s;t go, or that he him&s;elf would go thither.</P>
<P>The King was ob&s;erved to be more than ordinarily pen|&s;ive. And his fondne&s;s to Lady <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> increa&s;ed, and broke out in very indecent in&s;tances. The Grand Prior of <HI>France,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Vendome</HI>'s brother, had made &s;ome ap|plications to that Lady, with which the King was highly offended. It was &s;aid, the King came in on a &s;udden, and &s;aw that which provoked him: So he commanded him im|mediately to go out of <HI>England.</HI> Yet after that the King care&s;&s;ed her in the view of all people, which he had never done on any occa&s;ion or to any per&s;on formerly. The King was ob&s;erved to be colder and more re&s;erved to the Duke than ordinary. But what was under all this was &s;till a deep &s;ecret. Lord <HI>Halifax</HI> was let into no part of it. He &s;till went on again&s;t Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter.</HI> He complained in Coun|cil, that there were many razures in the books of the Trea|&s;ury, and that &s;everal leaves were cut out of tho&s;e books: And he moved the King to go to the Trea&s;ury chamber, that the books might be laid before him, and that he might judge of the matter upon &s;ight. So the King named the next <HI>Monday.</HI> And it was then expected, that the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> would have been turned out of all, if not &s;ent to the Tower. And a me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to Mr. <HI>May,</HI> then at <HI>Wind|&s;or,</HI> to de&s;ire him to come to Court that day, which it was ex|pected
<PB N="606" REF="621">
would prove a critical day. And it proved to be &s;o in|deed, tho' in a different way.</P>
<P>All this winter the King looked better than he had done <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's &s;ickne&s;s.</NOTE> for many years. He had a humour in his leg, which look|ed like the beginning of the gout: So that for &s;ome weeks he could not walk, as he u&s;ed to do generally three or four hours a day in the Park; which he did commonly &s;o fa&s;t, that as it was really an exerci&s;e to him&s;elf, &s;o it was a trouble to all about him to hold up with him: In the &s;tate the King was in, he not being able to walk, &s;pent much of his time in his laboratory, and was running a proce&s;s for the fixing of <HI>Mer|cury.</HI> On the fir&s;t of <HI>February,</HI> being a <HI>Sunday,</HI> he eat little all day, and came to Lady <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> at night, and called for a porringer of &s;poon meat. It was made too &s;trong for his &s;tomach. So he eat little of it: And he had an unquiet night. In the morning one Dr. <HI>King,</HI> a Phy&s;ician, and a Chymi&s;t, came, as he had been ordered, to wait on him. All the King's di&s;cour&s;e to him was &s;o broken, that he could not under&s;tand what he meant. And the Doctor concluded, he was under &s;ome great di&s;order, either in his mind, or in his body. The Doctor amazed at this, went out, and meet|ing with Lord <HI>Peterborough,</HI> he &s;aid, the King was in a &s;trange humour, for he did not &s;peak one word of &s;en&s;e. Lord <HI>Peterborough</HI> de&s;ired he would go in again to the bed|chamber, which he did. And he was &s;carce come in, when the King, who &s;eemed all the while to be in great confu&s;i|on, fell down all of a &s;udden in a fit like an apoplexy: He looked black, and his eyes turned in his head. The phy&s;i|cian, who had been formerly an eminent Surgeon, &s;aid, it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ave the King's life, if one minute was lo&s;t: He would rather venture on the rigour of the law, than leave the King to peri&s;h. And &s;o he let him blood. The King came out of that fit: And the phy&s;icians approved what Dr. <HI>King</HI> had done: Upon which the Privy Council ordered him a thou&s;and pound, which yet was never paid him. Tho' the King came out of that fit, yet the effects of it hung &s;till upon him, &s;o that he was much oppre&s;&s;ed. And the phy&s;i|cians did very much apprehend the return of another fit, and that it would carry him off: So they looked on him as a dead man. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> &s;poke a little to him, to di&s;po&s;e him to prepare for whatever might be before him; to which the King an&s;wered not a word. But that was im|puted partly to the Bi&s;hop's cold way of &s;peaking, and partly to the ill opinion they had of him at Court, as too
<PB N="607" REF="622">
bu&s;y in oppo&s;ition to Popery. <HI>Sancroft</HI> made a very weighty exhortation to him; in which he u&s;ed a good degree of free|dom, which he &s;aid was nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince he was going to be judged by one who was no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons. To him the King made no an&s;wer neither; nor yet to <HI>Ken,</HI> tho' the mo&s;t in favour with him of all the Bi&s;hops. Some imputed this to an in&s;en&s;ibility; of which too vi&s;ible an in&s;tance ap|peared, &s;ince Lady <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> &s;at in the bed taking care of him as a wife of a hu&s;band. Others gue&s;&s;ed truer, that it would appear he was of another religion. On <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> a &s;econd fit returned. And then the phy&s;icians told the Duke, that the King was not like to live a day to an end.</P>
<P>The Duke immediately ordered <HI>Hudle&s;ton,</HI> the Prie&s;t that <NOTE PLACE="marg">He received the Sacra|ments from a Popi&s;h Prie&s;t.</NOTE> had a great hand in &s;aving the King at <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> fight, (for which he was excepted out of all &s;evere acts that were made again&s;t Prie&s;ts,) to be brought to the lodgings under the bed|chamber. And when he was told what was to be done, he was in great confu&s;ion, for he had no ho&s;tie about him. But he went to another Prie&s;t, that lived in the Court, who gave him the pix with an ho&s;tie in it. But that poor Prie&s;t was &s;o frighted, that he run out of <HI>Whitehall</HI> in &s;uch ha&s;te that he &s;truck again&s;t a po&s;t, and &s;eemed to be in a fit of madne&s;s with fear. As &s;oon as <HI>Hudle&s;ton</HI> had prepared every thing that was nece&s;&s;ary, the Duke whi&s;pered the King in the ear. Upon that the King ordered that all who were in the bedchamber &s;hould withdraw, except the Earls of <HI>Bath,</HI> and <HI>Fever&s;ham:</HI> And the door was double looked. The compa|ny was kept out half an hour: Only Lord <HI>Fever&s;ham</HI> opened the door once, and called for a gla&s;s of water. Cardinal <HI>Howard</HI> told me at <HI>Rome,</HI> that <HI>Hudle&s;ton,</HI> according to the relation that he &s;ent thither, made the King go thro' &s;ome acts of contrition, and, after &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion as he could then make, he gave him ab&s;olution and the other Sacraments. The ho&s;tie &s;tuck in his throat: And that was the occa&s;ion of calling for a gla&s;s of water. He al&s;o gave him extream Unc|tion. All mu&s;t have been performed very &s;uperficially, &s;ince it was &s;o &s;oon ended. But the King &s;eemed to be at great ea&s;e upon it. It was given out, that the King &s;aid to <HI>Hudle|&s;ton,</HI> that he had &s;aved him twice, fir&s;t his body, and now his &s;oul; and that he a&s;ked him, if he would have him declare him&s;elf to be of their Church. But it &s;eems he was prepared for this, and &s;o diverted the King from it; and &s;aid, he took it upon him to &s;atisfy the world in that particular. But tho' by the principles of all religions what&s;oever he ought to have
<PB N="608" REF="623">
obliged him to make open profe&s;&s;ion of his religion, yet, it &s;eems, the con&s;equences of that were apprehended; for with|out doubt that poor Prie&s;t acted by the directions that were given him. The company was &s;uffered to come in. And the King went thro' the agonies of death with a calm and a con&s;tancy, that amazed all who were about him, and knew how he had lived. This made &s;ome conclude, that he had made a will, and that his quiet was the effect of that. <HI>Ken</HI> applied him&s;elf much to the awaking the King's con&s;cience. He &s;poke with a great elevation, both of thought and expre&s;|&s;ion, like a man in&s;pired, as tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent told me. He re&s;umed the matter often, and pronounced many &s;hort eja|culations and prayers, which affected all that were pre&s;ent, ex|cept him that was the mo&s;t concerned, who &s;eemed to take no notice of him, and made no an&s;wers to him. He pre&s;|&s;ed the King &s;ix or &s;even times to receive the Sacrament. But the King always declined it, &s;aying, he was very weak. A table with the elements upon it ready to be con&s;ecrated was brought into the room; which occa&s;ioned a report to be then &s;pread about, that he had received it. <HI>Ken</HI> pre&s;&s;ed him to declare that he de&s;ired it, and that he died in the Commu|nion of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> To that he an&s;wered no|thing. <HI>Ken</HI> a&s;ked him, if he de&s;ired ab&s;olution of his &s;ins. It &s;eems the King, if he then thought any thing at all, thought that would do him no hurt. So <HI>Ken</HI> pronounced it over him: For which he was blamed, &s;ince the King expre&s;&s;ed no &s;en&s;e or &s;orrow for his pa&s;t life, nor any purpo&s;e of amendment. It was thought to be a pro&s;titution of the peace of the Church, to give it to one, who, after a life led as the King's had been, &s;eemed to harden him&s;elf again&s;t every thing that could be &s;aid to him. <HI>Ken</HI> was al&s;o cen&s;ured for another piece of indecen|cy: He pre&s;ented the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> Lady <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI>'s &s;on, to be ble&s;&s;ed by the King. Upon this &s;ome that were in the room cried out, the King was their common father. And upon that all kneeled down for his ble&s;&s;ing, which he gave them. The King &s;uffered much inwardly, and &s;aid, he was burnt up within; of which he complained often, but with great decency. He &s;aid once, he hoped he &s;hould climb up to heaven's gates, which was the only word &s;avouring of religion that he was heard to &s;peak.</P>
<P>He gathered all his &s;trength to &s;peak his la&s;t words to the Duke, to which every one hearkned with great attention. He expre&s;&s;ed his kindne&s;s to him, and that he now delivered all over to him with great joy. He recommended Lady <HI>Port&s;|mouth</HI>
<PB N="609" REF="624">
over and over again to him. He &s;aid, he had always loved her, and he loved her now to the la&s;t; and be&s;ought the Duke, in as melting words as he could fetch out, to be very kind to her and to her &s;on. He recommended his other chil|dren to him: And concluded, let not poor <HI>Nelly</HI> &s;tarve; that was Mrs. <HI>Guyn.</HI> But he &s;aid nothing of the Queen, nor any one word of his people, or of his &s;ervants: Nor did he &s;peak one word of religion, or concerning the payment of his debts, tho' he left behind him about 90000 guineas, which he had gathered, either out of the privy pur&s;e, or out of the money which was &s;ent him from <HI>France,</HI> or by other methods, and which he had kept &s;o &s;ecretly that no per&s;on what&s;oever knew any thing of it.</P>
<P>He continued in the agony till <HI>Friday</HI> at eleven a clock, <NOTE PLACE="marg">His death.</NOTE> being the &s;ixth of <HI>February</HI> 1684/5; and then died in the fifty fourth year of his age, after he had reigned, if we reckon from his father's death, thirty &s;ix years, and eight days; or, if we reckon from his Re&s;toration, twenty four years, eight months, and nine days. There were many very apparent &s;u&s;picions of his being poi&s;oned: For tho' the fir&s;t acce&s;s looked like an apoplexy, yet it was plain in the progre&s;s of it that it was no apoplexy. When his body was opened, the phy&s;icians who viewed it were, as it were, led by tho&s;e who might &s;u&s;pect the truth to look upon the parts that were certainly &s;ound. But both <HI>Lower</HI> and <HI>Needham,</HI> two famous phy&s;icians, told me, they plainly di&s;cerned two or three blew &s;pots on the out|&s;ide of the &s;tomach. <HI>Needham</HI> called twice to have it open|ed: But the &s;urgeons &s;eemed not to hear him. And when he moved it the &s;econd time, he, as he told me, heard <HI>Lower</HI> &s;ay to one that &s;tood next him, <HI>Needham</HI> will undo us, calling thus to have the &s;tomach opened, for he may &s;ee they will not do it. They were diverted to look to &s;omewhat el&s;e: And when they returned to look upon the &s;tomach, it was carried away: So that it was never viewed. <HI>Le Fevre,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> phy|&s;ician, told me, he &s;aw a blackne&s;s in the &s;houlder: Upon which he made an inci&s;ion, and &s;aw it was all mortified. <HI>Short,</HI> another phy&s;ician, who was a Papi&s;t, but after a form of his own, did very much &s;u&s;pect foul dealing: And he had talked more freely of it, than any of the Prote&s;tants dur&s;t do at that time. But he was not long after taken &s;uddenly ill, upon a large draught of wormwood wine which he had drunk in the hou&s;e of a Popi&s;h patient, that lived near the Tower, who had &s;ent for him, of which he died. And, as he &s;aid to <HI>Lower, Millington,</HI> and &s;ome other phy&s;icians, he believed that he him&s;elf was poi&s;oned for his having &s;poken &s;o freely of

the King's death. The King's body was indecently neglect|ed. Some parts of his inwards, and &s;ome pieces of the fat, were left in the water in which they were wa&s;hed: All which were &s;o carele&s;&s;ly looked after, that the water being poured out at a &s;cullery hole that went to a drain, in the mouth of which a grate lay, the&s;e were &s;een lying on the grate many days af|ter. His funeral was very mean. He did not lie in &s;tate: No mournings were given: And the expence of it was not equal to what an ordinary Nobleman's funeral will ri&s;e to. Many upon this &s;aid, that he de&s;erved better from his brother, than to be thus ungratefully treated in ceremonies that are publick, and that make an impre&s;&s;ion on tho&s;e who &s;ee them, and who will make &s;evere ob&s;ervations and inferences upon &s;uch omi&s;|&s;ions. But &s;ince I have mentioned the &s;u&s;picions of poi&s;on, as the cau&s;e of his death, I mu&s;t add, that I never heard any lay tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions on his brother. But his dying &s;o critical|ly, as it were in the minute in which he &s;eemed to begin a turn of affairs, made it to be generally the more believed, and that the Papi&s;ts had done it, either by the means of &s;ome of Lady <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI>'s &s;ervants, or, as &s;ome fancied, by poi&s;oned &s;nuff; for &s;o many of the &s;mall veins of the brain were bur&s;t, that the brain was in great di&s;order, and no judgment could be made concerning it. To this I &s;hall add a very &s;urpri&s;ing &s;tory, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>N. B.</HI> This is added to the original in a loo&s;e &s;heet.</NOTE> that I had in <HI>November</HI> 1709 from Mr. <HI>Henly</HI> of <HI>Hamp&s;hire.</HI> He told me, that, when the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> came over to <HI>England</HI> in the year 1699, he heard, that &s;he had talked as if King <HI>Charles</HI> had been poi&s;oned; which he de&s;iring to have from her own mouth, &s;he gave him this account of it. She was always pre&s;&s;ing the King to make both him&s;elf and his people ea&s;y, and to come to a full agreement with his Parlia|ment: And he was come to a final re&s;olution of &s;ending away his brother, and of calling a Parliament; which was to be ex|ecuted the next day after he fell into that fit of which he died. She was put upon the &s;ecret, and &s;poke of it to no per&s;on alive, but to her Confe&s;&s;or: But the Confe&s;&s;or, &s;he believed, told it to &s;ome, who &s;eeing what was to follow took that wicked cour&s;e to prevent it. Having this from &s;o worthy a per&s;on, as I have &s;et it down without adding the lea&s;t circum&s;tance to it, I thought it too important not to be mentioned in this hi&s;tory. It di&s;covers both the knavery of Confe&s;&s;ors, and the practices of Papi&s;ts, &s;o evidently, that there is no need of making any further reflections on it.</P>
<P><PB N="611" REF="626">
Thus lived and died King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd. He was the greate&s;t in&s;tance in hi&s;tory of the various revolutions of which any one man &s;eemed capable. He was bred up, the <NOTE PLACE="marg">His charac|ter.</NOTE> fir&s;t twelve years of his life, with the &s;plendor that became the heir of &s;o great a Crown. After that he pa&s;t thro' eigh|teen years in great inequalities, unhappy in the war, in the lo&s;s of his Father, and of the Crown of <HI>England. Scotland</HI> did not only receive him, tho' upon terms hard of dige&s;ti|on, but made an attempt upon <HI>England</HI> for him, tho' a fee|ble one. He lo&s;t the battle of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> with too much in|difference: And then he &s;hewed more care of his per&s;on, than became one who had &s;o much at &s;take. He wandered about <HI>England</HI> for ten weeks after that, hiding from place to place. But, under all the apprehen&s;ions he had then upon him, he &s;hewed a temper &s;o carele&s;s, and &s;o much turned to levity, that he was then diverting him&s;elf with little hou&s;hold &s;ports, in as unconcerned a manner, as if he had made no lo&s;s, and had been in no danger at all. He got at la&s;t out of <HI>Eng|land.</HI> But he had been obliged to &s;o many, who had been faithful to him, and careful of him, that he &s;eemed afterwards to re&s;olve to make an equal return to them all: And finding it not ea&s;y to reward them all as they de&s;erved, he forgot them all alike. Mo&s;t Princes &s;eem to have this pretty deep in them; and to think that they ought never to remember pa&s;t &s;ervices, but that their acceptance of them is a full re|ward. He, of all in our age, exerted this piece of preroga|tive in the ample&s;t manner: For he never &s;eemed to charge his memory, or to trouble his thoughts, with the &s;en&s;e of any of the &s;ervices that had been done him. While he was abroad at <HI>Paris, Colen,</HI> or <HI>Bru&s;&s;ells,</HI> he never &s;eemed to lay any thing to heart. He pur&s;ued all his diver&s;ions, and irregular plea|&s;ures, in a free carrier; and &s;eemed to be as &s;erene under the lo&s;s of a Crown, as the greate&s;t Philo&s;opher could have been. Nor did he willingly hearken to any of tho&s;e projects, with which he often complained that his Chancellor per&s;ecuted him. That in which he &s;eemed mo&s;t concerned was, to find money for &s;upporting his expence. And it was often &s;aid, that, if <HI>Cromwell</HI> would have compounded the matter, and have given him a good round pen&s;ion, that he might have been induced to re&s;ign his title to him. During his exile he delivered him|&s;elf &s;o entirely to his plea&s;ures, that he became incapable of application. He &s;pent little of his time in reading or &s;tudy, and yet le&s;s in thinking. And, in the &s;tate his affairs were then in, he accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to &s;ay to every per&s;on, and upon all
<PB N="612" REF="627">
occa&s;ions, that which he thought would plea&s;e mo&s;t: So that words or promi&s;es went very ea&s;ily from him. And he had &s;o ill an opinion of mankind, that he thought the great art of living and governing was, to manage all things and all per|&s;ons with a depth of craft and di&s;&s;imulation. And in that few men in the world could put on the appearances of &s;incerity better than he could: Under which &s;o much artifice was u&s;ual|ly hid, that in conclu&s;ion he could deceive none, for all were become mi&s;tru&s;tful of him. He had great vices, but &s;carce any vertues to correct them: He had in him &s;ome vices that were le&s;s hurtful, which corrected his more hurtful ones. He was during the active part of life given up to &s;loth and lewd|ne&s;s to &s;uch a degree, that he hated bu&s;ine&s;s, and could not bear the engaging in any thing that gave him much trouble, or put him under any con&s;traint. And, tho' he de&s;ired to be|come ab&s;olute, and to overturn both our religion and our laws, yet he would neither run the ri&s;que, nor give him&s;elf the trou|ble, which &s;o great a de&s;ign required. He had an appearance of gentlene&s;s in his outward deportment: But he &s;eemed to have no bowels nor tenderne&s;s in his nature: And in the end of his life he became cruel. He was apt to forgive all crimes, even blood it &s;elf: Yet he never forgave any thing that was done again&s;t him&s;elf, after his fir&s;t and general act of indem|nity, which was to be reckoned as done rather upon maxims of &s;tate than inclinations of mercy. He delivered him&s;elf up to a mo&s;t enormous cour&s;e of vice, without any &s;ort of re|&s;traint, even from the con&s;ideration of the neare&s;t rela|tions: The mo&s;t &s;tudied extravagancies that way &s;eemed, to the very la&s;t, to be much delighted in, and pur&s;ued by him. He had the art of making all people grow fond of him at fir&s;t, by a &s;oftne&s;s in his whole way of conver&s;ation, as he was cer|tainly the be&s;t bred man of the age. But when it appeared how little could be built on his promi&s;e, they were cured of the fondne&s;s that he was apt to rai&s;e in them. When he &s;aw young men of quality, who had &s;omething more than ordi|nary in them, he drew them about him, and &s;et him&s;elf to corrupt them both in religion and morality; in which he proved &s;o unhappily &s;ucce&s;sful, that he left <HI>England</HI> much changed at his death from what he had found it at his Re&s;toration. He lov|ed to talk over all the &s;tories of his life to every new man that came about him. His &s;tay in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the &s;hare he had in the war of <HI>Paris,</HI> in carrying me&s;&s;ages from the one &s;ide to the other, were his common topicks. He went over the&s;e in a very graceful manner; but &s;o often, and &s;o copiou&s;ly, that all
<PB N="613" REF="628">
tho&s;e who had been long accu&s;tomed to them grew weary of them: And when he entred on tho&s;e &s;tories they u&s;ually with|drew: So that he often began them in a full audience, and before he had done there were not above four or five left about him: Which drew a &s;evere je&s;t from <HI>Wilmot,</HI> Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter.</HI> He &s;aid, he wondred to &s;ee a man have &s;o good a memory as to repeat the &s;ame &s;tory without lo&s;ing the lea&s;t circum|&s;tance, and yet not remember that he had told it to the &s;ame per&s;ons the very day before. This made him fond of &s;trangers; for they hearkned to all his often repeated &s;tories, and went away as in a rapture at &s;uch an uncommon conde&s;cen&s;ion in a King.</P>
<P>His per&s;on and temper, his vices as well as his fortunes, re|&s;emble the character that we have given us of <HI>Tiberius</HI> &s;o much, that it were ea&s;y to draw the parallel between them. <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s bani&s;hment, and his coming afterwards to reign, makes the compari&s;on in that re&s;pect come pretty near. His hating of bu&s;ine&s;s, and his love of plea&s;ures; his rai&s;ing of favourites, and tru&s;ting them entirely; and his pulling them down, and hat|ing them exce&s;&s;ively; his art of covering deep de&s;igns, par|ticularly of revenge, with an appearance of &s;oftne&s;s, brings them &s;o near a likene&s;s, that I did not wonder much to ob|&s;erve the re&s;emblance of their face and per&s;on. At <HI>Rome</HI> I &s;aw one of the la&s;t &s;tatues made for <HI>Tiberius,</HI> after he had lo&s;t his teeth. But, bating the alteration which that made, it was &s;o like King <HI>Charles,</HI> that Prince <HI>Borghe&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Signior Domi|nico</HI> to whom it belonged, did agree with me in thinking that it looked like a &s;tatue made for him.</P>
<P>Few things ever went near his heart. The Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;|ter</HI>'s death &s;eemed to touch him much. But tho&s;e who knew him be&s;t thought it was, becau&s;e he had lo&s;t him by whom only he could have balanced the &s;urviving brother, whom he hated, and yet embroiled all his affairs to pre&s;erve the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to him.</P>
<P>His ill conduct in the fir&s;t <HI>Dutch</HI> war, and tho&s;e terrible ca|lamities of the plague, and fire of <HI>London,</HI> with that lo&s;s and reproach which he &s;uffered by the in&s;ult at <HI>Chatham,</HI> made all people conclude there was a cur&s;e upon his government. His throwing the publick hatred at that time upon Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI> was both unju&s;t and ungrateful. And when his people had brought him out of all his difficulties upon his entring into the triple alliance, his &s;elling that to <HI>France,</HI> and his entring on the &s;econd <HI>Dutch</HI> war with as little colour as he had for the fir&s;t; his beginning it with the attempt on the <HI>Dutch Smirna</HI> fleet;
<PB N="614" REF="629">
the &s;hutting up the Exchequer; and his declaration for tolera|tion, which was a &s;tep for the introduction of Popery; make &s;uch a chain of black actions, flowing from blacker de&s;igns, that it amazed tho&s;e who had known all this to &s;ee with what impudent &s;trains of flattery addre&s;&s;es were penned during his life, and yet more gro&s;&s;ly after his death. His contributing &s;o much to the rai&s;ing the greatne&s;s of <HI>France,</HI> chiefly at &s;ea, was &s;uch an error, that it could not flow from want of thought, or of true &s;en&s;e. <HI>Rouvigny</HI> told me, he de&s;ired that all the me|thods the <HI>French</HI> took in the increa&s;e and conduct of their na|val force might be &s;ent him. And, he &s;aid, he &s;eemed to &s;tudy them with concern and zeal. He &s;hewed what errors they committed, and how they ought to be corrected, as if he had been a Viceroy to <HI>France,</HI> rather than a King that ought to have watched over and prevented the progre&s;s they made, as the greate&s;t of all the mi&s;chiefs that could happen to him or to his people. They that judged the mo&s;t favourably of this, thought it was done out of revenge to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> that, with the a&s;&s;i&s;|tance of &s;o great a fleet as <HI>France</HI> could join to his own, he might be able to de&s;troy them. But others put a wor&s;e con|&s;truction on it; and thought, that &s;eeing he could not quite ma&s;ter or deceive his &s;ubjects by his own &s;trength and manage|ment, he was willing to help forward the greatne&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> at &s;ea, that by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance he might more certainly &s;ubdue his own people; according to what was generally believed to have fallen from Lord <HI>Clifford,</HI> that, if the King mu&s;t be in a dependance, it was better to pay it to a great and generous King, than to five hundred of his own in&s;olent &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>No part of his character looked wickeder, as well as mean|er, than that he, all the while that he was profe&s;&s;ing to be of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> expre&s;&s;ing both zeal and affection to it, was yet &s;ecretly reconciled to the Church of <HI>Rome:</HI> Thus, mocking God and deceiving the world with &s;o gro&s;s a preva|rication. And his not having the hone&s;ty or courage to own it at the la&s;t: His not &s;hewing any &s;ign of the lea&s;t re|mor&s;e for his ill led life, or any tenderne&s;s either for his &s;ub|jects in general, or for the Queen and his &s;ervants: And his re|commending only his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es and their children to his bro|ther's care, would have been a &s;trange conclu&s;ion to any other's life, but was well enough &s;uited to all the other parts of his.</P>
<P>The two papers found in his &s;trong box concerning religi|on, and afterwards publi&s;hed by his brother, looked like &s;tudy and rea&s;oning. <HI>Tenni&s;on</HI> told me, he &s;aw the original in <HI>Pe|py</HI>'s hand, to whom King $word$ tru&s;ted them for &s;ome time.
<PB N="615" REF="630">
They were interlined in &s;everal places. And the interlinings &s;eemed to be writ in a hand different from that in which the papers were writ. But he was not &s;o well acquainted with the King's hand, as to make any judgment in the matter, whe|ther they were writ by him or not. All that knew him, when they read them, did without any &s;ort of doubting con|clude, that he never compo&s;ed them: For he never read the Scriptures, nor laid things together, further than to turn them to a je&s;t, or for &s;ome lively expre&s;&s;ion. The&s;e papers were pro|bably writ either by Lord <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> or by Lord <HI>Aubigny,</HI> who knew the &s;ecret of his religion, and gave him tho&s;e papers, as ab|&s;tracts of &s;ome di&s;cour&s;es they had with him on tho&s;e heads, to keep him fixed to them. And it is very probable that they, apprehending their danger if any &s;uch papers had been found about him writ in their hand, might prevail with him to copy them out him&s;elf, tho' his lazine&s;s that way made it certainly no ea&s;y thing to bring him to give him&s;elf &s;o much trouble. He had talked over a great part of them to my &s;elf: So that, as &s;oon as I &s;aw them, I remembred his expre&s;&s;ions, and perceiv|ed that he had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the argument, as far as tho&s;e papers could carry him. But the publi&s;hing them &s;hewed a want of judgment, or of regard to his memory, in tho&s;e who did it: For the greate&s;t kindne&s;s, that could be &s;hewn to his memory, would have been, to let both his papers and him&s;elf be forgotten.</P>
<P>Which I &s;hould certainly have done, if I had not thought that the laying open of what I knew concerning him and his affairs might be of &s;ome u&s;e to po&s;terity. And therefore, how ungrateful &s;oever this labour has proved to my &s;elf, and how unacceptable &s;oever it may be to &s;ome, who are either obliged to remember him gratefully, or by the engagement of parties and intere&s;ts are under other bia&s;&s;es, yet I have gone thro' all that I knew relating to his life and reign with that regard to truth, and what I think may be in&s;tructive to mankind, which became an impartial writer of hi&s;tory, and one who believes, that he mu&s;t give an account to God of what he writes, as well as of what he &s;ays and does.</P>

<P>_I AM now to pro&s;ecute this work, and to give <NOTE PLACE="marg">1685 A reign happily be|gun, but in|glorious all over.</NOTE> the relation of an inglorious and unpro&s;pe|rous reign, that was begun with great advan|tages: But the&s;e were &s;o poorly managed, and &s;o ill improved, that bad de&s;igns were ill laid, and wor&s;e conducted; and all came in con|clu&s;ion under one of the &s;trange&s;t cata&s;trophe's that is in any hi&s;tory.

threw up in a day. Such an unexpected revolution de&s;erves to be well opened: I will do it as fully as I can. But, hav|ing been beyond &s;ea almo&s;t all this reign, many &s;mall par|ticulars, that may well de&s;erve to be remembred, may have e&s;caped me: Yet as I had good opportunities to be well in|formed, I will pa&s;s over nothing that &s;eems of any impor|tance to the opening &s;uch great and unu&s;ual tran&s;actions. I will endeavour to watch over my pen with more than ordinary caution, that I may let no &s;harpne&s;s, from any ill u&s;age I my &s;elf met with, any way po&s;&s;e&s;s my thoughts, or bia&s;s my mind: On the contrary, the &s;ad fate of this unfortunate Prince will make me the more tender in not aggravating the errors of his reign. As to my own particular, I will re|member how much I was once in his favour, and how high|ly I was obliged to him. And as I mu&s;t let his de&s;igns and mi&s;carriages be &s;een, &s;o I will open things as fully as I can, that it may appear on whom we ought to lay the chief load of them: Which indeed ought to be chiefly charged on his religion, and on tho&s;e who had the management of his con|&s;cience, his Prie&s;ts, and his <HI>Italian</HI> Queen; which la&s;t had hitherto acted a popular part with great artifice and &s;kill, but came now to take off the ma&s;k, and to di&s;cover her &s;elf.</P>
<P>This Prince was much neglected in his childhood, during <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's fir&s;t educa|tion.</NOTE> the time he was under his Father's care. The Parliament, getting him into their hands, put him under the Earl of <HI>Nor|thumberland</HI>'s government, who, as the Duke him&s;elf told me, treated him with great re&s;pect, and a very tender re|gard. When he e&s;caped out of their hands, by the means of Coll. <HI>Bamfield,</HI> his Father writ to him a letter in cypher, concluding in the&s;e plain words, <HI>Do this as you expect the ble&s;&s;ing of your loving Father.</HI> This was &s;ent to <HI>William</HI> Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> but came after he had made his e&s;cape: And &s;o I found it among his papers: And I gave it to the Duke of <HI>York</HI> in the year 1674. He &s;aid to me, he believed he had his Father's cypher among his papers, and that he would try to decypher the letter: But I believe he never did it. I told him, I was confident, that as the letter was writ when his e&s;cape was under con&s;ideration, &s;o it contained an order to go to the Queen, and to be obedient to her in all things, except in matters of religion. The King appointed Sir <HI>John Berkeley,</HI> afterwards Lord <HI>Berkeley,</HI> to be his Governor. It was a &s;trange choice, if it was not that, in &s;uch a want of men who &s;tuck to the King as was then, there
<PB N="619" REF="633">
were few capable in any &s;ort of &s;uch a tru&s;t. <HI>Berkeley</HI> was bold and in&s;olent, and &s;eemed to lean to Popery: He was certainly very arbitrary, both in his temper and notions. The Queen took &s;uch a particular care of this Prince, that he was &s;oon ob&s;erved to have more of her favour than either of his two brothers: And &s;he was &s;o &s;et on making pro&s;e|lytes, hoping that <HI>to &s;ave a &s;oul would cover a multitude of &s;ins,</HI> that it is not to be doubted but &s;he u&s;ed more than ordi|nary arts to draw him over to her religion. Yet, as he him&s;elf told me, he &s;tood out again&s;t her practices.</P>
<P>During his &s;tay in <HI>France</HI> he made &s;ome campaigns un|der <NOTE PLACE="marg">He learned war under <HI>Turenne.</HI></NOTE> Mr. <HI>de Turenne,</HI> who took him &s;o particularly under his care, that he in&s;tructed him in all that he undertook, and &s;hewed him the rea&s;ons of every thing he did &s;o minutely, that he had great advantages by being formed under the greate&s;t General of the age: <HI>Turenne</HI> was &s;o much taken with his application, and the heat that he &s;hewed, that he recommended him out of mea&s;ure. He &s;aid often of him: There was the greate&s;t Prince, and like to be the be&s;t Ge|neral of his time. This rai&s;ed his character &s;o much, that the King was not a little eclip&s;ed by him. Yet he quickly ran into amours and vice. And that by degrees wore out any courage that had appeared in his youth. And in the end of his life he came to lo&s;e the reputation of a brave man and a good Captain &s;o entirely, that either he was ne|ver that which flatterers gave out concerning him, or his age and affairs wrought a very unu&s;ual change on him.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed to follow his mother's maxims all the while he was beyond &s;ea. He was the head of a party that was formed in the King's &s;mall Court again&s;t Lord <HI>Clarendon.</HI> And it was believed that his applications to Lord <HI>Clarendon</HI>'s daughter were made at fir&s;t on de&s;ign to di&s;honour his fa|mily, tho' &s;he had the addre&s;s to turn it another way.</P>
<P>After his brother's Re&s;toration he applied him&s;elf much to <NOTE PLACE="marg">He was Ad|miral of <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> the Marine, in which he arrived at great &s;kill, and brought the fleet &s;o entirely into his dependance, that even after he laid down the command he was &s;till the ma&s;ter of our whole &s;ea force. He had now for the&s;e la&s;t three years directed all our coun&s;els with &s;o ab&s;olute an authority, that the King &s;eemed to have left the government wholly in his hands: Only the unlooked for bringing in the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> put him under no &s;mall apprehen&s;ions, that at &s;ome time or other the King might &s;lip out of his hands: Now that fear was over.</P>
<P><PB N="620" REF="634">
The King was dead: And &s;o all the Court went immediately and paid their duty to him. Orders were pre&s;ently given for proclaiming him King. It was a heavy &s;olemnity: Few <NOTE PLACE="marg">He was pro|claimed King.</NOTE> tears were &s;hed for the former, nor were there any &s;houts of joy for the pre&s;ent King. A dead &s;ilence, but without any di&s;order or tumult, followed it thro' the &s;treets. When the Privy Coun&s;ellors came back from the proclamation, and waited on the new King, he made a &s;hort &s;peech to them; which it &s;eems was well con&s;idered, and much liked by him, for he repeated it to his Parliament, and upon &s;e|veral other occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>He began with an expo&s;tulation for the ill character that had been entertained of him. He told them, in very po&s;i|tive <NOTE PLACE="marg">His fir&s;t &s;peech</NOTE> words, that he would never depart from any branch of his prerogative: But with that he promi&s;ed, that he would maintain the liberty and property of the &s;ubject. He expre&s;|&s;ed his good opinion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as a friend to monarchy. Therefore, he &s;aid, he would defend and main|tain the Church, and would pre&s;erve the government in Church and State, as it was e&s;tabli&s;hed by law.</P>
<P>This &s;peech was &s;oon printed, and gave great content to <NOTE PLACE="marg">well re|ceived.</NOTE> tho&s;e who believed that he would &s;tick to the promi&s;es made in it. And tho&s;e few, who did not believe it, yet dur&s;t not &s;eem to doubt of it. The pulpits of <HI>England</HI> were full of it, and of thank&s;givings for it. It was magnified as a &s;ecurity far greater than any that laws could give. The common phra&s;e was, We have now the <HI>word of a King, and a word never yet broken.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this a new &s;et of addre&s;&s;es went round <HI>England,</HI> in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Addre&s;&s;es made to him.</NOTE> which the highe&s;t commendations that flattery could invent were given to the late King; and a&s;&s;urances of loyalty and fidelity were renewed to the King, in terms that &s;hewed there were no jealou&s;ies nor fears left. The Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford</HI> in their addre&s;s promi&s;ed to obey the King <HI>without limitations or re&s;trictions.</HI> The King's promi&s;e pa&s;t for a thing &s;o &s;acred, that they were looked on as ill bred that put in their addre&s;s, <HI>our Religion e&s;tabli&s;hed by law;</HI> which looked like a tie on the King to maintain it: Whereas the &s;tile of the more courtly was to put all our &s;ecurity upon the King's promi&s;e. The Clergy of <HI>London</HI> added a word to this in their addre&s;s, <HI>our Religion e&s;tabli&s;hed by law, dearer to us than our lives.</HI> This had &s;uch an in&s;inuation in it, as made it very unacceptable. Some followed their pattern. But this was
<PB N="621" REF="635">
marked to be remembred again&s;t tho&s;e that u&s;ed &s;o menacing a form.</P>
<P>All employments were ended of cour&s;e with the life of the former King. But the King continued all in their places: Only the po&s;ts in the Hou&s;hold were given to tho&s;e who had &s;erved the King, while he was Duke of <HI>York.</HI> The Marquis of <HI>Halifax</HI> had rea&s;on to look on him&s;elf as in ill terms with the King: So in a private audience he made the be&s;t ex|cu&s;es he could for his conduct of late. The King diverted the di&s;cour&s;e; and &s;aid, he would forget every thing that was pa&s;t, except his behaviour in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Exclu|&s;ion. The King al&s;o added, that he would expect no other &s;ervice of him than what was con&s;i&s;tent with law. He pre|pared him for the exaltation of the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter.</HI> He <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> made Lord Trea&s;urer.</NOTE> &s;aid, he had &s;erved him well, and had &s;uffered on his ac|count, and therefore he would now &s;hew favour to him: And the next day he declared him Lord Trea&s;urer. His brother the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> was made Lord Privy Seal: And the Marquis of <HI>Halifax</HI> was made Lord Pre&s;ident of the Council. The Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI> was looked on as a man lo&s;t at Court: And &s;o was Lord <HI>Godolphin.</HI> But the former of the&s;e in&s;inuated him&s;elf &s;o into the Queen's confidence, that he was, beyond all peoples expectation, not only maintained in his po&s;ts, but grew into great degrees of fa|vour.</P>
<P>The Queen was made to con&s;ider the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> as a <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI> in favour.</NOTE> per&s;on that would be in the intere&s;t of the King's daughters, and united to the Church party. So &s;he &s;aw it was nece&s;&s;ary to have one in a high po&s;t, who &s;hould depend wholly on her, and be entirely hers. And the Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI> was the only per&s;on capable of that. The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> did upon his advancement become &s;o violent and boi&s;terous, that the whole Court joined to &s;upport the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> as the proper balance to the other. Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> was put in a great po&s;t in the Queen's Hou&s;hold.</P>
<P>But before the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> had the White Staff, the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cu&s;toms and Exci&s;e levied a|gain&s;t law.</NOTE> Court engaged the Lord <HI>Godolphin,</HI> and the other Lords of the Trea&s;ury, to &s;end orders to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms to continue to levy the Cu&s;toms, tho' the act that granted them to the late King was only for his life, and &s;o was now determined with it. It is known, how much this matter was conte&s;ted in King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t's time, and what had pa&s;t upon it. The legal method was to have made entries, and to have taken bonds for tho&s;e
<PB N="622" REF="636">
duties, to be paid when the Parliament &s;hould meet, and renew the grant. Yet the King declared, that he would levy the Cu&s;toms, and not &s;tay for the new grant. But, tho' this did not agree well with the King's promi&s;e of maintaining liberty and property, yet it was &s;aid in excu&s;e for it, that, if the Cu&s;toms &s;hould not be levied in this interval, great importations would be made, and the markets would be &s;o &s;tocked, that this would very much &s;poil the King's Cu&s;toms. But in an&s;wer to this it was &s;aid again, entries were to be made, and bonds taken, to be &s;ued when the act granting them &s;hould pa&s;s. Endeavours were u&s;ed with &s;ome of the merchants to refu&s;e to pay tho&s;e duties, and to di&s;|pute the matter in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall:</HI> But none would venture on &s;o bold a thing. He who &s;hould begin any &s;uch oppo|&s;ition would probably be ruined by it: So none would run that hazard. The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> got this to be done be|fore he came into the Trea&s;ury: So he pretended, that he only held on in the cour&s;e that was begun by others.</P>
<P>The additional Exci&s;e had been given to the late King only for life. But there was a clau&s;e in the act that em|powered the Trea&s;ury to make a farm of it for three years, without adding a limiting clau&s;e, in ca&s;e it &s;hould be &s;o long due. And it was thought a great &s;tretch of the clau&s;e, to make a fraudulent farm, by which it &s;hould continue to be levied three years after it was determined according to the letter and intendment of the act. A farm was now brought out, as made during the King's life, tho' it was well known that no &s;uch farm had been made; for it was made after his death, but a fal&s;e date was put to it. This matter &s;eemed doubtful. It was laid before the Judges. And they all, ex|cept two, were of opinion that it was good in law. So two Proclamations were ordered, the one for levying the Cu&s;toms, and the other for the Exci&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e came out in the fir&s;t week of the reign, and gave a melancholy pro&s;pect. Such beginnings did not promi&s;e well, and rai&s;ed ju&s;t fears in the minds of tho&s;e who con|&s;idered the con&s;equences of &s;uch proceedings. They &s;aw, that by violence and fraud duties were now to be levied without law. But all people were under the power of fear or flattery to &s;uch a degree, that none dur&s;t complain, and few would venture to talk of tho&s;e matters.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons of all ranks went in &s;uch crouds to pay their duty <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's coldne&s;s to tho&s;e who had been for the Exclu|&s;ion.</NOTE> to the King, that it was not ea&s;y to admit them all. Mo&s;t of the Whigs that were admitted were received coldly at be&s;t.
<PB N="623" REF="637">
Some were &s;harply reproached for their pa&s;t behaviour. Others were denied acce&s;s. The King began likewi&s;e to &s;ay, that he would not be &s;erved as his brother had been: He would have all about him &s;erve him without re&s;erve, and go thorough in his bu&s;ine&s;s. Many were amazed to &s;ee &s;uch &s;teps made at fir&s;t. The &s;econd <HI>Sunday</HI> after he came to the Throne, he, to the &s;urprize of the whole Court, went openly to Ma&s;s, and &s;ent <HI>Caryl</HI> to <HI>Rome</HI> with letters to the Pope, but without a character.</P>
<P>In one thing only the King &s;eemed to comply with the <NOTE PLACE="marg">He &s;eemed to be on e|qual terms with the <HI>French</HI> King.</NOTE> genius of the Nation, tho' it proved in the end to be only a&s;hew. He &s;eemed re&s;olved not to be governed by <HI>French</HI> coun&s;els, but to act in an equality with that haughty Mo|narch in all things. And, as he entertained all the other foreign Mini&s;ters with a&s;&s;urances that he would maintain the balance of <HI>Europe</HI> with a more &s;teady hand than had been done formerly; &s;o when he &s;ent over the Lord <HI>Churchil</HI> to the Court of <HI>France</HI> with the notice of his brother's death, he ordered him to ob&s;erve exactly the ceremony and &s;tate with which he was received, that he might treat him, who &s;hould be &s;ent over with the complement in return to that, in the &s;ame manner. And this he ob&s;erved very punctually, when the Mar&s;hal <HI>de Lorge</HI> came over. This was &s;et about by the Courtiers as a &s;ign of another &s;pirit, that might be looked for in a reign &s;o begun. And this made &s;ome im|pre&s;&s;ion on the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and put them to a &s;tand. But, not long after this, the <HI>French</HI> King &s;aid to the Duke of <HI>Villeroy,</HI> (who told it to young <HI>Rouvigny,</HI> now Earl of <HI>Galloway,</HI> from whom I had it,) that the King of <HI>England,</HI> after all the high things given out in his name, was willing to take his money, as well as his brother had done.</P>
<P>The King did al&s;o give out, that he would live in a particular confidence with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and the States of <HI>Holland.</HI> And, becau&s;e <HI>Chudleigh</HI> the Envoy there had openly broken with the Prince, (for he not only wait|ed no more on him, but acted openly again&s;t him; and once in the <HI>Vorhaut</HI> had affronted him, while he was driving the Prince&s;s upon the &s;now in a <HI>Trainau,</HI> according to the <HI>Ger|man</HI> manner, and pretending they were ma&s;ked, and that he did not know them, had ordered his coachman to keep his way, as they were coming towards the place where he drove;) the King recalled him, and &s;ent <HI>Shelton</HI> in his room, who was the haughtie&s;t, but withal the weake&s;t man, that he could have found out. He talked out all &s;ecrets, and made
<PB N="624" REF="638">
him&s;elf the &s;corn of all <HI>Holland.</HI> The Courtiers now &s;aid every where, that we had a martial Prince who loved glory, who would bring <HI>France</HI> into as humble a dependance on us, as we had been formerly on that Court.</P>
<P>The King did, &s;ome days after his coming to the Crown, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's cour&s;e of life.</NOTE> promi&s;e the Queen and his Prie&s;ts, that he would &s;ee Mrs. <HI>Sidley</HI> no more, by whom he had &s;ome children. And he &s;poke openly again&s;t leudne&s;s, and expre&s;&s;ed a dete&s;tation of drunkenne&s;s. He &s;ate many hours a day about bu&s;ine&s;s with the Council, the Trea&s;ury, and the Admiralty. It was up|on this &s;aid, that now we &s;hould have a reign of action and bu&s;ine&s;s, and not of &s;loth and luxury, as the la&s;t was. Mrs. <HI>Sidley</HI> had lodgings in <HI>Whitehall:</HI> Orders were &s;ent to her to leave them. This was done to mortify her; for &s;he pre|tended that &s;he &s;hould now govern as ab&s;olutely as the Duche&s;s of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> had done: Yet the King &s;till conti|nued a &s;ecret commerce with her. And thus he began his reign with &s;ome fair appearances. A long and great fro&s;t had &s;o &s;hut up the <HI>Dutch</HI> ports, that for &s;ome weeks they had no letters from <HI>England:</HI> At la&s;t the news of the King's &s;ickne&s;s and death, and of the beginnings of the new reign, came to them all at once.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t difficulty the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was in, was with relation to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> He knew the King would <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;ent away the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI></NOTE> immediately, after the fir&s;t compliments were over, a&s;k him to di&s;mi&s;s him, if not to deliver him up. And as it was no way decent for him to break with the King upon &s;uch a point, &s;o he knew the States would never bear it. He thought it better to di&s;mi&s;s him immediately, as of him&s;elf. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed at this. Yet at parting he made great prote&s;tations both to the Prince and Prince&s;s of an inviolable fidelity to their intere&s;ts. So he retired to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> where he knew he could be &s;uffered to &s;tay no longer than till a return &s;hould come from <HI>Spain,</HI> upon the notice of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s death, and the declarations that the King was making of maintaining the balance of <HI>Europe.</HI> The Duke was upon that thinking to go to <HI>Vienna,</HI> or to &s;ome Court in <HI>Germany.</HI> But tho&s;e about him &s;tudied to inflame him both again&s;t the King and the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> They told him, the Prince by ca&s;ting him off had cancelled all former obligations, and &s;et him free from them: He was now to look to him&s;elf: And in&s;tead of wandring about as a vagabond, he was to &s;et him&s;elf to deliver his countrey, and to rai&s;e his party and his friends, who were now like
<PB N="625" REF="639">
to be u&s;ed very ill for their adhering to him and to his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>They &s;ent one over to <HI>England</HI> to try mens pul&s;es, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some in <HI>England</HI> be|gan to move for him.</NOTE> to &s;ee if it was yet a proper time to make an attempt. <HI>Wildman, Charlton,</HI> and &s;ome others went about trying, if men were in a di&s;po&s;ition to encourage an inva&s;ion. They talked of this in &s;o remote a way of &s;peculation, that tho' one could not but &s;ee what lay at bottom, yet they did not run into trea&s;onable di&s;cour&s;e. I was in general &s;ounded by them: Yet nothing was propo&s;ed that ran me into any dan|ger from concealing it. I did not think fears and dangers, nor &s;ome illegal acts in the admini&s;tration, could ju&s;|tify an in&s;urrection, as lawful in it &s;elf: And I was confident an in&s;urrection undertaken on &s;uch grounds would be &s;o ill &s;econded, and &s;o weakly &s;upported, that it would not only come to nothing, but it would precipitate our ruin. There|fore I did all I could to divert all per&s;ons with whom I had any credit from engaging in &s;uch de&s;igns. The&s;e were for &s;ome time carried on in the dark. The King, after he had put his affairs in a method, re&s;olved to ha&s;ten his Corona|tion, and to have it performed with great magnificence: And for &s;ome weeks he was &s;o entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the preparations for that &s;olemnity, that all bu&s;ine&s;s was laid a&s;ide, and nothing but ceremony was thought on.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time a Parliament was &s;ummoned: And all <NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange practices in elections of Parliament men.</NOTE> arts were u&s;ed to manage elections &s;o, that the King &s;hould have a Parliament to his mind. Complaints came up from all the parts of <HI>England</HI> of the inju&s;tice and violence u&s;ed in elections, beyond what had ever been practi&s;ed in former times. And this was &s;o univer&s;al over the whole Nation, that no corner of it was neglected. In the new Charters that had been granted, the election of the members was taken out of the hands of the inhabitants, and re&s;trained to the Corporation-men, all tho&s;e being left out who were not ac|ceptable at Court. In &s;ome Boroughs they could not find a number of men to be depended on: So the neighbouring Gentlemen were made the Corporation-men: And, in &s;ome of the&s;e, per&s;ons of other Counties, not &s;o much as known in the Borough, were named. This was practi&s;ed in the mo&s;t avowed manner in <HI>Cornwall</HI> by the Earl of <HI>Bath;</HI> who to &s;e|cure him&s;elf the Groom of the Stole's place, which he held all King <HI>Charles</HI>'s time, put the officers of the guards names in almo&s;t all the Charters of that County; which &s;ending up
<PB N="626" REF="640">
forty four members, they were for mo&s;t part &s;o cho&s;en, that the King was &s;ure of their votes on all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The&s;e methods were &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful over <HI>England,</HI> that when the elections were all returned, the King &s;aid, there were not above forty members, but &s;uch as he him&s;elf wi&s;hed for. They were neither men of parts nor e&s;tates: So there was no hope left, either of working on their under&s;tandings, or of making them &s;ee their intere&s;t, in not giving the King all at once. Mo&s;t of them were furious and violent, and &s;eemed re&s;olved to recommend them&s;elves to the King by putting every thing in his power, and by ruining all tho&s;e who had been for the Exclu&s;ion. Some few had de&s;igned to give the King the revenue only from three years to three years. The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> told me, that was what he looked for, tho' the po&s;t he was in made it not &s;o proper for him to move in it. But there was no pro&s;pect of any &s;trength in oppo&s;ing any thing that the King &s;hould a&s;k of them.</P>
<P>This gave all thinking men a melancholy pro&s;pect. <HI>Eng|land</HI> now &s;eemed lo&s;t, unle&s;s &s;ome happy accident &s;hould &s;ave <NOTE PLACE="marg">Evil pro|&s;pect from a bad Parlia|ment.</NOTE> it. All people &s;aw the way for packing a Parliament now laid open. A new &s;et of Charters and Corporation-men, if tho&s;e now named &s;hould not continue to be &s;till as com|pliant as they were at pre&s;ent, was a certain remedy, to which recour&s;e might be ea&s;ily had. The Boroughs of <HI>England</HI> &s;aw their privileges now wre&s;ted out of their hands, and that their elections, which had made them &s;o con&s;idera|ble before, were hereafter to be made as the Court &s;hould direct: So that from henceforth little regard would be had to them; and the u&s;ual practices in courting, or rather in corrupting them, would be no longer pur&s;ued. Thus all people were alarmed: But few dur&s;t &s;peak out, or complain openly. Only the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s agents made great u&s;e of this to inflame their party. It was &s;aid, here was a Parliament to meet, that was not the choice and repre&s;enta|tive of the Nation, and therefore was no Parliament. So they upon this po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all people with dreadful apprehen|&s;ions that a blow was now given to the con&s;titution, which could not be remedied, but by an in&s;urrection. It was re&s;olved to bring up petitions again&s;t &s;ome elections, that were &s;o indecently managed that it &s;eemed &s;carce po&s;&s;i|ble to excu&s;e them: But the&s;e were to be judged by a ma|jority of men, who knew their own elections to be &s;o faulty, that to &s;ecure them&s;elves they would ju&s;tify the re&s;t: And
<PB N="627" REF="641">
fair dealing was not to be expected from tho&s;e, who were &s;o deeply engaged in the like inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>All that was offered on the other hand to lay tho&s;e fears, which &s;o ill an appearance did rai&s;e, was, that it was pro|bable the King would go into mea&s;ures again&s;t <HI>France.</HI> All the offers of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion po&s;&s;ible were made him by <HI>Spain,</HI> the Empire, and the States.</P>
<P>The King had begun with the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> upon a <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;ubmits in every thing to the King.</NOTE> hard-point. He was not &s;atisfied with his di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> but wrote to him to break all tho&s;e officers who had waited on him while he was in <HI>Holland.</HI> In this they had only followed the Prince's example: So it was hard to puni&s;h them for that, which he him&s;elf had en|couraged. They had indeed &s;hewed their affections to him &s;o evidently, that the King wrote to the Prince, that he could not tru&s;t to him, nor depend on his friend&s;hip, as long as &s;uch men &s;erved under him. This was of a hard dige&s;tion. Yet, &s;ince the breaking them could be ea&s;ily made up by employing them afterwards, and by continuing their appointments to them, the Prince complied in this like|wi&s;e. And the King was &s;o well plea&s;ed with it, that when Bi&s;hop <HI>Turner</HI> complained of &s;ome things relating to the Prince and Prince&s;s, and propo&s;ed rougher methods, the King told him, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that the Prince and he &s;hould continue in good corre&s;pondence. Of this <HI>Turner</HI> gave an account to the other Bi&s;hops, and told them very &s;olemnly, that the Church would be in no hazard dur|ing the pre&s;ent reign; but that they mu&s;t take care to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> otherwi&s;e they would be in great danger.</P>
<P>The &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the Prince and the States to the King made &s;ome fancy, that this would overcome him. All peo|ple concluded, that it would &s;oon appear whether bigotry, or a de&s;ire of glory was the prevailing pa&s;&s;ion; &s;ince if he did not &s;trike in with an alliance that was then projected again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> it might be concluded that he was re&s;olved to deliver him&s;elf up to his Prie&s;ts, and to &s;acrifice all to their ends. The &s;ea&s;on of the year made it to be hoped, that the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament would be &s;o &s;hort that much could not be done in it, but that when the revenue &s;hould be granted, other matters might be put off to a win|ter &s;e&s;&s;ion. So that, if the Parliament &s;hould not deliver up the Nation in a heat all at once, but &s;hould leave half their work to another &s;e&s;&s;ion, they might come under &s;ome ma|nagement,
<PB N="628" REF="642">
and either &s;ee the intere&s;t of the Nation in ge|neral, or their own in particular; and &s;o manage their fa|vours to the Court in &s;uch a manner as to make them&s;elves nece&s;&s;ary, and not to give away too much at once, but be &s;paring in their bounty; which they had learned &s;o well in King <HI>Charles</HI>'s time, that it was to be hoped they would &s;oon fall into it, if they made not too much ha&s;te at their fir&s;t &s;et|ting out. So it was re&s;olved not to put them on too ha&s;tily in their fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion to judge of any election, but to keep that matter entire for &s;ome time, till they &s;hould break in|to parties.</P>
<P>The Coronation was &s;et for St. <HI>George</HI>'s day. <HI>Turner</HI> was <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King was crown|ed</NOTE> ordered to preach the &s;ermon: And both King and Queen re&s;olved to have all done in the Prote&s;tant form, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t in all the prayers: Only the King would not receive the Sacrament, which is always a part of the ceremony. In this certainly his Prie&s;ts di&s;pen&s;ed with him, and he had &s;uch &s;en&s;es given him of the oath, that he either took it as a &s;in with a re&s;olution not to keep it, or he had a re&s;erved mean|ing in his own mind. The Crown was not well fitted for the King's head: It came down too far, and covered the upper part of his face. The canopy carried over him did al&s;o break. Some other &s;maller things happen'd that were looked on as ill omens: And his &s;on by Mrs. <HI>Sidley</HI> died that day. The Queen with the Peere&s;&s;es made a more graceful figure. The be&s;t thing in <HI>Turner</HI>'s &s;ermon was, that he &s;et forth that part of <HI>Con&s;tantius Chlorus</HI>'s hi&s;tory very hand&s;omely, in which he tried who would be true to their religion, and reckoned that tho&s;e would be faithfulle&s;t to him&s;elf who were true&s;t to their God.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now &s;ay &s;omewhat concerning my &s;elf. At this <NOTE PLACE="marg">I went out of <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> time I went out of <HI>England.</HI> Upon King <HI>Charles</HI>'s death, I had de&s;ired leave to come and pay my duty to the King by the Marquis of <HI>Halifax.</HI> The King would not &s;ee me. So, &s;ince I was at that time in no &s;ort of employment, not &s;o much as allowed to preach any where, I re&s;olved to go abroad. I &s;aw we were like to fall into great confu&s;ion; and were either to be re&s;cued, in a way that I could not approve of, by the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s means, or to be delivered up by a meeting that had the face and name of a Parliament. I thought the be&s;t thing for me was to go out of the way. The King approved of this, and con&s;ented to my going: But &s;till refu&s;ed to &s;ee me. So I was to go beyond &s;ea, as to a voluntary Exile. This gave me great credit with all the
<PB N="629" REF="643">
male-contents: And I made the be&s;t u&s;e of it I could. I &s;poke very earne&s;tly to the Lord <HI>de la Meer,</HI> to Mrs. <HI>Hamb|den,</HI> and &s;uch others as I could meet with, who I feared might be drawn in by the agents of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> The King had not yet done that which would ju&s;tify extream coun&s;els. A raw rebellion would be &s;oon cru&s;hed, and give a colour for keeping up a &s;tanding army, or for bringing over a force from <HI>France.</HI> I perceived, many thought the con|&s;titution was &s;o broken into by the elections of the Hou&s;e of Commons, that they were di&s;po&s;ed to put all to hazard. Yet mo&s;t people thought the cri&s;is was not &s;o near, as it proved to be.</P>
<P>The deliberations in <HI>Holland,</HI> among the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Argile</HI> de|&s;igned to in|vade <HI>Scot|land.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Scotch</HI> that fled thither, came to ripen fa&s;ter than was expected. Lord <HI>Argile</HI> had been quiet ever &s;ince the di&s;|appointment in the year eighty three. He had lived for mo&s;t part in <HI>Frizeland,</HI> but came oft to <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> and met with the re&s;t of his countrymen that lay concealed there: The chief of whom were the Lord <HI>Melvill,</HI> Sir <HI>Patrick Hume,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Cochran.</HI> With the&s;e Lord <HI>Argile</HI> com|municated all the advices that were &s;ent him. He went on &s;till with his fir&s;t project. He &s;aid, he wanted only a &s;um of money to buy arms, and reckoned, that as &s;oon as he was fur|ni&s;hed with the&s;e, he might venture on <HI>Scotland.</HI> He re&s;olved to go to his own country, where he hoped he could bring five thou&s;and men together. And he reckoned that the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> and <HI>Southern</HI> Counties were under &s;uch apprehen&s;ions, that without laying of matters, or having corre&s;pondence among them, they would all at once come about him, when he had gathered a good force together in his own country. There was a rich widow in <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> who was full of zeal: So &s;he, hearing at what his de&s;igns &s;tuck, &s;ent to him, and furni&s;hed him with ten thou&s;and pounds. With this money he bought a &s;tock of arms and ammunition, which was very dextrou&s;ly managed by one that traded to <HI>Venice,</HI> as intended for the &s;ervice of that Republick. All was perform|ed with great &s;ecrecy, and put on board. They had &s;harp debates among them about the cour&s;e they were to hold. He was for &s;ailing round <HI>Scotland</HI> to his own country. <HI>Hume</HI> was for the &s;horter pa&s;&s;age: The other was a long naviga|tion, and &s;ubject to great accidents. <HI>Argile</HI> &s;aid, the fa&s;t|ne&s;&s;es of his own country made that to be the &s;afer place to gather men together. He pre&s;umed &s;o far on his own power, and on his management hitherto, that he took much
<PB N="630" REF="644">
upon him: So that the re&s;t were often on the point of break|ing with him.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> came &s;ecretly to them, and made <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI> forced on an ill|timed inva|&s;ion.</NOTE> up all their quarrels. He would willingly have gone with them him&s;elf: But <HI>Argile</HI> did not offer him the command: On the contrary he pre&s;&s;ed him to make an impre&s;&s;ion on <HI>England</HI> at the &s;ame time. This was not po&s;&s;ible: For the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> had yet made no preparations. So he was hurried into a fatal undertaking, before things were in any &s;ort ready for it. He had been indeed much pre&s;&s;ed to the &s;ame thing by <HI>Wade, Fergu&s;on,</HI> and &s;ome others about him, but chiefly by the Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> and the Lady <HI>Wentworth,</HI> who followed him to <HI>Bru&s;&s;ells</HI> de&s;perately in love with him. And both he and &s;he came to fancy, that he being married to his Duche&s;s while he was indeed of the age of con&s;ent, but not capable of a free one, the marriage was null: So they lived together: And &s;he had heated both her &s;elf and him with &s;uch enthu&s;ia&s;tical conceits, that they fancied what they did was approved of God. With this &s;mall council he took his mea&s;ures. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> a <HI>Scotch</HI> Gentleman of great parts, and many vertues, but a mo&s;t violent republican, and extrava|gantly pa&s;&s;ionate, did not like <HI>Argile</HI>'s &s;cheme: So he re&s;olved to run fortunes with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> He told me, that all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> among them were &s;till pre&s;&s;ing the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> to venture. They &s;aid, all the We&s;t of <HI>England</HI> would come about him, as &s;oon as he appeared, as they had done five or &s;ix years ago. They reckoned there would be no fighting, but that the guards, and others who adhered to the King, would melt to nothing before him. They fancied, the City of <HI>London</HI> would be in &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition to revolt, that if he &s;hould land in the We&s;t the King would be in great perplexity. He could not have two armies: And his fear of tumults near his per&s;on would oblige him to keep &s;uch a force about him, that he would not be able to &s;end any again&s;t him. So they reckoned he would have time to form an army, and in a little while be in a condition to &s;eek out the King, and fight him on equal terms.</P>
<P>This appeared a mad and de&s;perate undertaking to the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> him&s;elf. He knew what a weak body a rabble was, and how unable to deal with troops long train|ed. He had neither money nor officers, and no encourage|ment from the men of e&s;tates and intere&s;t in the country. It &s;eemed too early yet to venture. It was the throwing away
<PB N="631" REF="645">
all his hopes in one day. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> how vehemently &s;oever he was &s;et on the de&s;ign in general, yet &s;aw nothing in this &s;cheme that gave any hopes: So he argued much again&s;t it. And he &s;aid to me, that the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was pu&s;hed on to it again&s;t his own &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on: But he could not refu&s;e to hazard his per&s;on, when others were &s;o forward. Lord <HI>Grey</HI> &s;aid, that <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh landed with a &s;maller number, and &s;ucceeded. <HI>Fletcher</HI> an&s;wered, he was &s;ure of &s;everal of the Nobility, who were little Princes in tho&s;e days. <HI>Fergu&s;on</HI> in his enthu&s;ia&s;tical way &s;aid, it was a good cau&s;e, and that God would not leave them unle&s;s they left him. And tho' the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s cour&s;e of life gave him no great rea&s;on to hope that God would appear &s;ignal|ly for him, yet even he came to talk enthu&s;ia&s;tically on the &s;ubject. But <HI>Argile</HI>'s going, and the promi&s;e he had made of coming to <HI>England</HI> with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te, had &s;o fixed him, that, all further deliberations being laid a&s;ide, he pawned a parcel of jewels, and bought up arms; and they were put aboard a &s;hip freighted for <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>James</HI> was &s;o intent upon the pomp of his Corona|tion, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The&s;e de|&s;igns were carried on with great &s;ecrecy.</NOTE> that for &s;ome weeks more important matters were not thought on. Both <HI>Argile</HI> and <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s people were &s;o true to them, that nothing was di&s;covered by any of them. Yet &s;ome days after <HI>Argile</HI> had &s;ailed, the King knew of it: For the night before I left <HI>London,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Aran</HI> came to me, and told me, the King had an adverti&s;ement of it that very day. I &s;aw, it was fit for me to make ha&s;te: Otherwi&s;e I might have been &s;eized on, if it had been only to put the affront on me, of being &s;u&s;pected of holding corre&s;pondence with traitors.</P>
<P><HI>Argile</HI> had a very pro&s;perous voyage. He &s;ent out a boat <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Argile</HI> land|ed in <HI>Scot|land.</HI></NOTE> at <HI>Orkney</HI> to get intelligence, and to take pri&s;oners. This had no other effect, but that it gave intelligence where he was: And the wind chopping, he was obliged to &s;ail away, and leave his men to mercy. The winds were very favour|able, and turned as his occa&s;ions required: So that in a very few days he arrived in <HI>Argile&s;hire.</HI> The mi&s;under&s;tandings between him and <HI>Hume</HI> grew very high; for he carried all things with an air of authority, that was not ea&s;y to tho&s;e who were &s;etting up for liberty. At his landing he found, that the early notice the Council had of his de&s;igns had &s;poiled his whole &s;cheme; for they had brought in all the Gentlemen of his country to <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> which &s;aved them, tho' it helped on his ruin. Yet he got above five and twen|ty
<PB N="632" REF="646">
hundred men to come to him. If with the&s;e he had immedi|ately gone over to the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> counties of <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Renfrew,</HI> he might have given the government much trouble. But he lingred too long, hoping &s;till to have brought more of his <HI>Highlanders</HI> together. He reckoned the&s;e were &s;ure to him, and would obey him blindfold: Whereas, if he had gone out of his own country with a &s;mall force, tho&s;e who might have come in to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance might al&s;o have di&s;puted his authority: And he could not bear contradiction. Much time was by this means lo&s;t: And all the country was &s;ummoned to come out again&s;t him. At la&s;t he cro&s;&s;ed an arm of the &s;ea, and landed in the i&s;le of <HI>Bute;</HI> where he &s;pent twelve days more, till he had eat up that I&s;land, pretending &s;till, that he hoped to be joined by more of his <HI>Highlanders.</HI></P>
<P>He had left his arms in a ca&s;tle, with &s;uch a guard as he <NOTE PLACE="marg">But was de|feated and taken.</NOTE> could &s;pare: But they were routed by a party of the King's forces. And with this he lo&s;t both heart and hope. And then, apprehending that all was gone, he put him&s;elf in a di&s;|gui&s;e, and had almo&s;t e&s;caped: But he was taken. A body of Gentlemen that had followed him &s;tood better to it, and forced their way thro': So that the greater part of them e&s;caped. Some of the&s;e were taken: The chief of them were Sir <HI>John Cochran, Ailoffe,</HI> and <HI>Rumbold.</HI> The&s;e two la&s;t were <HI>Engli&s;hmen:</HI> But I knew not upon what motive it was, that they cho&s;e rather to run fortunes with <HI>Argile,</HI> than with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> Thus was this rebellion brought to a &s;peedy end, with the effu&s;ion of very little blood. Nor was there much &s;hed in the way of ju&s;tice; for it was con&s;idered, that the <HI>Highlanders</HI> were under &s;uch ties by their tenures, that it was &s;omewhat excu&s;able in them to follow their Lord. Mo&s;t of the Gentlemen were brought in by order of Coun|cil to <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> which pre&s;erved them. One of tho&s;e that were with <HI>Argile,</HI> by a great pre&s;ence of mind, got to <HI>Carlile,</HI> where he called for po&s;t hor&s;es; and &s;aid, he was &s;ent by the General to carry the good news by word of mouth to the King. And &s;o he got to <HI>London:</HI> And there he found a way to get beyond &s;ea.</P>
<P><HI>Argile</HI> was brought in to <HI>Edenburgh.</HI> He expre&s;&s;ed even <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Argile</HI>'s ex|ecution.</NOTE> a cheerful calm under all his misfortunes. He ju&s;tified all he had done: For, he &s;aid, he was unju&s;tly attainted: That had di&s;&s;olved his allegiance: So it was ju&s;tice to him&s;elf and his family, to endeavour to recover what was &s;o wrongfully taken from him. He al&s;o thought, that no allegiance was due to the King, till he had taken the oath which the law
<PB N="633" REF="647">
pre&s;cribed to be taken by our Kings at their Coronati|on, or the receipt of their princely dignity. He de&s;ired that Mr. <HI>Charteris</HI> might be ordered to attend upon him; which was granted. When he came to him, he told him he was &s;atisfied in con&s;cience with the lawfulne&s;s of what he had done, and therefore de&s;ired he would not di&s;turb him with any di&s;cour&s;e on that &s;ubject. The other, after he had told him his &s;en&s;e of the matter, complied ea&s;ily with this. So all that remained was to prepare him to die, in which he expre&s;&s;ed an un&s;haken firmne&s;s. The Duke of <HI>Queens|bury</HI> examined him in private. He &s;aid, he had not laid his bu&s;ine&s;s with any in <HI>Scotland.</HI> He had only found credit with a per&s;on that lent him money; upon which he had tru&s;ted, perhaps too much, to the di&s;po&s;itions of the people, &s;harpned by their admini&s;tration. When the day of his execution came, Mr. <HI>Charteris</HI> happen'd to come to him as he was ending din|ner: He &s;aid to him plea&s;antly, <HI>&s;er&ograve; venientibus o&s;&s;a.</HI> He pray|ed often with him, and by him&s;elf, and went to the &s;caf|fold with great &s;erenity. He had complained of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> much, for delaying his coming &s;o long after him, and for a&s;&s;uming the name of King; both which, he &s;aid, were contrary to their agreement at parting. Thus he died, pitied by all. His death, being pur&s;uant to the &s;entence pa&s;t three years before, of which mention was made, was looked on as no better than murder. But his conduct in this matter was made up of &s;o many errors, that it appear|ed he was not made for de&s;igns of this kind.</P>
<P><HI>Ailoffe</HI> had a mind to prevent the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, and hav|ing got a penknife into his hands gave him&s;elf &s;everal &s;tabbs. And thinking he was certainly a dead man, he cried out, and &s;aid, now he defied his enemies. Yet he had not pierced his guts: So his wounds were not mortal. And, it being believed that he could make great di&s;coveries, he was brought up to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rumbold</HI> was he that dwelt in <HI>Rye-Hou&s;e,</HI> where it was <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rumbold</HI> at his death de|nied the <HI>Rye-Plot.</HI></NOTE> pretended the plot was laid for murdering the late and the pre&s;ent King. He denied the truth of that con&s;piracy. He owned, he thought the Prince was as much tied to the peo|ple, as the people were to the Prince; and that, when a King departed from the legal mea&s;ures of government, the people had a right to a&s;&s;ert their liberties, and to re&s;train him. He did not deny, but that he had heard many propo&s;itions at <HI>We&s;t</HI>'s chambers about killing the two brothers; and upon that he had &s;aid, it could have been ea&s;ily executed near his hou&s;e;
<PB N="634" REF="648">
upon which &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e had followed, how it might have been managed. But, he &s;aid, it was only talk, and that no|thing was either laid, or &s;o much as re&s;olved on. He &s;aid, he was not for a Commonwealth, but for Kingly govern|ment according to the laws of <HI>England:</HI> But he did not think that the King had his authority by any divine right, which he expre&s;&s;ed in rough, but &s;ignificant words. He &s;aid, he did not believe that God had made the greater part of man|kind with &s;addles on their backs, and bridles in their mouths, and &s;ome few booted and &s;purred to ride the re&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Cochran</HI> had a rich father, the Earl of <HI>Dundonald:</HI> And he offered the Prie&s;ts 5000 <HI>l.</HI> to &s;ave his &s;on. They want|ed a &s;tock of money for managing their de&s;igns: So they interpo&s;ed &s;o effectually, that the bargain was made. But, to cover it, <HI>Cochran</HI> petitioned the Council that he might be &s;ent to the King; for he had &s;ome &s;ecrets of great im|portance, which were not fit to be communicated to any but to the King him&s;elf. He was upon that brought up to <HI>Lon|don:</HI> And, after he had been for &s;ome time in private with the King, the matters he had di&s;covered were &s;aid to be of &s;uch importance, that in con&s;ideration of that the King par|doned him. It was &s;aid, he had di&s;covered all their nego|tiations with the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> But this was a pretence only given out to conceal the bargain; for the Prince told me, he had never once &s;een him. The &s;ecret of this came to be known &s;oon after.</P>
<P>When <HI>Ailoffe</HI> was brought up to <HI>London,</HI> the King examin|ed him, but could draw nothing from him, but one &s;evere repartee. He being &s;ullen, and refu&s;ing to di&s;cover any thing, the King &s;aid to him; Mr. <HI>Ailoffe,</HI> you know it is in my power to pardon you, therefore &s;ay that which may de&s;erve it. It was &s;aid that he an&s;wered, that tho' it was in his power, yet it was not in his nature to pardon. He was nephew to the old Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> by marriage; for <HI>Ailoffe</HI>'s aunt was his fir&s;t wife, but &s;he had no children. It was thought, that the nearne&s;s of his relation to the King's children might have moved him to pardon him, which would have been the mo&s;t effectual confutation of his bold repartee: But he &s;uffered with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Immediately after <HI>Argile</HI>'s execution, a Parliament was <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> held in <HI>Scotland.</HI> Upon King <HI>Charles</HI>'s death, the Mar|quis of <HI>Queensbury,</HI> &s;oon after made a Duke, and the Earl of <HI>Perth,</HI> came to Court. The Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI> told
<PB N="635" REF="649">
the King, that if he had any thoughts of changing the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, he could not make any one &s;tep with him in that matter. The King &s;eemed to receive this very kindly from him; and a&s;&s;ured him, he had no &s;uch in|tention, but that he would have a Parliament called, to which he &s;hould go his Commi&s;&s;ioner, and give all po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;urances in the matter of religion, and get the revenue to be &s;ettled, and &s;uch other laws to be pa&s;t as might be ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the common &s;afety. The Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI> pre&s;&s;ed the Earl of <HI>Perth</HI> to &s;peak in the &s;ame &s;train to the King. But, tho' he pretended to be &s;till a Prote&s;tant, yet he could not prevail on him to &s;peak in &s;o po&s;itive a &s;tile. I had not then left <HI>London:</HI> So the Duke &s;ent me word of this, and &s;eemed &s;o fully &s;atisfied with it, that he thought all would be &s;afe. So he prepared in&s;tructions by which both the revenue and the King's authority were to be carried ve|ry high. He has often &s;ince that time told me, that the King made tho&s;e promi&s;es to him in &s;o frank and hearty a manner, that he concluded it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to be acting a part. Therefore he always believed, that the Prie&s;ts gave him leave to promi&s;e every thing, and that he did it very &s;incerely; but that afterwards they pretended, they had a power to di&s;&s;olve the obligation of all oaths and pro|mi&s;es; &s;ince nothing could be more open and free than his way of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf was, tho' afterwards he had no &s;ort of regard to any of the promi&s;es he then made. The Te&s;t had been the King's own act while he was in <HI>Scotland.</HI> So he thought, the putting that on all per&s;ons would be the mo&s;t acceptable method, as well as the mo&s;t effectual, for &s;ecuring the Prote&s;tant Religion. Therefore he propo&s;ed an in&s;truction obliging all people to take the Te&s;t, not only to qualify them for publick employments, but that all tho&s;e to whom the Council &s;hould tender it &s;hould be bound to take it under the pain of trea&s;on: And this was granted. He al&s;o projected many other &s;evere laws, that left an arbitrary power in the Privy Council. And, as he was naturally vio|lent and imperious in his own temper, &s;o he &s;aw the King's inclinations to tho&s;e methods, and hoped to have recom|mended him&s;elf effectually by being in&s;trumental in &s;et|ting up an ab&s;olute and de&s;potick form of government. But he found afterwards how he had deceived him&s;elf, in think|ing that any thing, but the delivering up his religion, could be acceptable long. And he &s;aw, after he had prepared a cruel &s;cheme of government, other men were tru&s;ted with

the management of it: And it had almo&s;t proved fatal to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;at not long. No oppo&s;ition <NOTE PLACE="marg">Granted all that the King de&s;ired.</NOTE> was made. The Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI> gave very full a&s;&s;ur|ances in the point of religion, that the King would never alter it, but would maintain it, as it was e&s;tabli&s;hed by law. And in confirmation of them he propo&s;ed that act enjoining the Te&s;t, which was pa&s;t, and was looked on as a full &s;ecu|rity; tho' it was very probable, that all the u&s;e that the Council would make of this di&s;cretional power lodged with them, would be only to tender the Te&s;t to tho&s;e that might &s;cruple it on other accounts, but that it would be offered to none of the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> In return for this the Par|liament gave the King for life all the revenue that had been given to his brother: And with that &s;ome additional taxes were given.</P>
<P>Other &s;evere laws were al&s;o pa&s;t. By one of the&s;e an Inqui&s;i|tion <NOTE PLACE="marg">Severe laws were pa&s;&s;ed.</NOTE> was upon the matter &s;et up. All per&s;ons were required, under the pain of trea&s;on, to an&s;wer to all &s;uch que&s;tions as &s;hould be put to them by the Privy Council. This put all men under great apprehen&s;ions, &s;ince upon this act an In|qui&s;ition might have been grafted, as &s;oon as the King plea&s;|ed. Another act was only in one particular ca&s;e: But it was a crying one, and &s;o de&s;erves to be remembred.</P>
<P>When <HI>Ca&s;tairs</HI> was put to the torture, and came to capi|tulate in order to the making a di&s;covery, he got a promi&s;e from the Council, that no u&s;e &s;hould be made of his depo|&s;ition again&s;t any per&s;on what&s;oever. He in his depo&s;ition &s;aid &s;omewhat that brought Sir <HI>Hugh Cambell</HI> and his &s;on under the guilt of trea&s;on, who had been taken up in <HI>Lon|don</HI> two years before, and were kept in pri&s;on all this while. The Earl of <HI>Melfort</HI> got the promi&s;e of his e&s;tate, which was about 1000 <HI>l.</HI> a year, as &s;oon as he &s;hould be con|victed of high trea&s;on. So an act was brought in, which was to la&s;t only &s;ix weeks; and enacted, that if within that time any of the Privy Council would depo&s;e that any man was proved to be guilty of high trea&s;on, he &s;hould upon &s;uch a proof be attainted. Upon which, as &s;oon as the act was pa&s;t, four of the Privy Council &s;tood up, and affirmed that the <HI>Cambells</HI> were proved by <HI>Ca&s;tairs</HI>'s depo&s;ition to be guilty. Upon this both father and &s;on were brought to the bar, to &s;ee what they had to &s;ay, why the &s;entence &s;hould not be executed. The old Gentleman, then near eighty, &s;eeing the ruin of his family was determined, and that he was con|demned
<PB N="637" REF="651">
in &s;o unu&s;ual a manner, took courage, and &s;aid, the oppre&s;&s;ion they had been under had driven them to de|&s;pair, and made them think how they might &s;ecure their lives and fortunes: Upon this he went to <HI>London,</HI> and had &s;ome meetings with <HI>Baillie,</HI> and others: That one was &s;ent to <HI>Scotland</HI> to hinder all ri&s;ings: That an oath of &s;ecrecy was indeed offered, but was never taken upon all this. So it was pretended, he had confe&s;&s;ed the crime, and by a &s;hew of mercy they were pardoned: But the Earl of <HI>Mel&s;ort</HI> po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of their e&s;tate. The old Gentleman died &s;oon after. And very probably his death was ha&s;tned by his long and rigorous impri&s;onment, and this unexampled conclu&s;ion of it; which was &s;o univer&s;ally condemned, that when the news of it was writ to foreign parts, it was not ea&s;y to make people believe it po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But now the &s;itting of the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> came <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Oates</HI> con|victed of perjury,</NOTE> on. And, as a preparation to it, <HI>Oates</HI> was convicted of per|jury, upon the evidence of the witne&s;&s;es from St. <HI>Omar</HI>'s, who had been brought over before to di&s;credit his te&s;timo|ny. Now Juries were &s;o prepared, as to believe more ea&s;ily than formerly. So he was condemned to have his Prie&s;tly habit taken from him, to be a pri&s;oner for life, to be &s;et on the pillory in all the publick places of the City, and ever after that to be &s;et on the pillory four times a year, and to be whipt by the common hangman from <HI>Aldgate</HI> to <HI>Newgate</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">and cruelly whipt.</NOTE> one day, and the next from <HI>Newgate</HI> to <HI>Tyburn;</HI> which was executed with &s;o much rigour, that his back &s;eemed to be all over flead. This was thought too little if he was guilty, and too much if innocent, and was illegal in all the parts of it: For as the &s;ecular Court could not order the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical habit to be taken from him, &s;o to condemn a man to a per|petual impri&s;onment was not in the power of the Court: And the extream rigour of &s;uch whipping was without a precedent. Yet he, who was an original in all things, bore this with a con&s;tancy that amazed all tho&s;e who &s;aw it. So that this treatment did rather rai&s;e his reputation, than &s;ink it.</P>
<P>And, that I may join things of the &s;ame &s;ort together, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dangerfield</HI> killed.</NOTE> tho' they were tran&s;acted at &s;ome di&s;tance of time, <HI>Danger|field,</HI> another of the witne&s;&s;es in the Popi&s;h plot, was al&s;o found guilty of perjury, and had the &s;ame puni&s;hment. But it had a more terrible conclu&s;ion; for a brutal &s;tudent of the law, who had no private quarrel with him, but was only tran&s;ported with the heat of that time, &s;truck him over the
<PB N="638" REF="652">
head with his cane, as he got his la&s;t la&s;h. This hit him &s;o fatally, that he died of it immediately. The per&s;on was apprehended. And the King left him to the law. And, tho' great interce&s;&s;ion was made for him, the King would not interpo&s;e. So he was hanged for it.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the Parliament met. The King in his &s;peech re|peated <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> that, which he had &s;aid to the Council upon his fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion to the Throne. He told them, &s;ome might think, the keeping him low would be the &s;ure&s;t way to have fre|quent Parliamens: But they &s;hould find the contrary, that the u&s;ing him well would be the be&s;t argument to per&s;uade him to meet them often. This was put in to prevent a motion, which was a little talked of abroad, but none would venture on it within doors, that it was &s;afe&s;t to grant the revenue only for a term of years.</P>
<P>The revenue was granted for life, and every thing el&s;e <NOTE PLACE="marg">Grants the revenue for life.</NOTE> that was a&s;ked, with &s;uch a profu&s;ion, that the Hou&s;e was more forward to give, than the King was to a&s;k: To which the King thought fit to put a &s;top by a me&s;&s;age, intimat|ing that he de&s;ired no more money that &s;e&s;&s;ion. And yet this forwardne&s;s to give in &s;uch a reign was &s;et on by <HI>Mu&s;grave</HI> and others, who pretended afterwards, when money was a&s;ked for ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary ends, to be frugal patriots, and to be careful managers of the publick trea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>As for religion, &s;ome began to propo&s;e a new and firmer &s;ecurity to it. But all the Courtiers run out into eloquent <NOTE PLACE="marg">And tru&s;ts to the King's promi&s;e.</NOTE> harangues on that &s;ubject: And pre&s;&s;ed a vote, that they took the King's word in that matter, and would tru&s;t to it; and that this &s;hould be &s;ignified in an addre&s;s to him. This would bind the King in point of honour, and gain his heart &s;o entirely, that it would be a tie above all laws what|&s;oever. And the tide run &s;o &s;trong that way, that the Hou&s;e went into it without oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> who had been for &s;ome years Envoy in <HI>France,</HI> was brought over, and &s;et up to be a manager in the Hou&s;e of Commons. He told them, the reputation of the Nation was beginning to ri&s;e very high all <HI>Europe</HI> over, under a Prince who&s;e name &s;pread terror every where: And if this was confirmed by the entire confidence of his Parlia|ment, even in the tendere&s;t matters, it would give &s;uch a turn to the affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> that <HI>England</HI> would again hold the balance, and their King would be the arbiter of <HI>Europe.</HI> This was &s;econded by all the Court flatterers. So in their
<PB N="639" REF="653">
addre&s;s to the King, thanking him for his &s;peech, they told him, they tru&s;ted to him &s;o entirely, that they relied on his word, and thought them&s;elves and their religion &s;afe, &s;ince he had promi&s;ed it to them.</P>
<P>When this was &s;ettled, the petitions concerning the elec|tions were pre&s;ented. Upon tho&s;e <HI>Seimour</HI> &s;poke very high, and with much weight. He &s;aid, the complaints of the ir|regularities in elections were &s;o great, that many doubted whether this was a true repre&s;entative of the Nation, or not. He &s;aid, little equity was expected upon petitions, where &s;o many were too guilty to judge ju&s;tly and impartially. He &s;aid, it concerned them to look to the&s;e: For if the Nation &s;aw no ju&s;tice was to be expected from them, other methods would be found, in which they might come to &s;uffer that ju&s;tice which they would not do. He was a haughty man, and would not communicate his de&s;ign in making this mo|tion to any: So all were &s;urpri&s;ed with it, but none &s;econd|ed it. This had no effect, not &s;o much as to draw on a debate.</P>
<P>The Courtiers were projecting many laws to ruin all who <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment was violent.</NOTE> oppo&s;ed their de&s;igns. The mo&s;t important of the&s;e was an act declaring trea&s;ons during that reign, by which words were to be made trea&s;on. And the clau&s;e was &s;o drawn, that any thing &s;aid to di&s;parage the King's per&s;on or go|vernment was made trea&s;on; within which every thing &s;aid to the di&s;honour of the King's religion would have been comprehended, as Judges and Juries were then modelled. This was chiefly oppo&s;ed by Serjeant <HI>Maynard,</HI> who in a very grave &s;peech laid open the inconvenience of making words trea&s;on: They were often ill heard and ill under&s;tood, and were apt to be mi&s;recited by a very &s;mall variation: Men in pa&s;&s;ion or in drink might &s;ay things they never intended: Therefore he hoped they would keep to the law of the twenty fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, by which an overt|act was made the nece&s;&s;ary proof of ill intentions. And when others in&s;i&s;ted, that <HI>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth &s;pake,</HI> he brought the in&s;tance of our Saviour's words, <HI>De&s;troy this Temple;</HI> and &s;hewed how near <HI>the Temple</HI> was to <HI>this Temple,</HI> pronouncing it in <HI>Syriack,</HI> &s;o that the diffe|rence was almo&s;t imperceptible. There was nothing more innocent than the&s;e words, as our Saviour meant, and &s;poke them: But nothing was more criminal than the &s;etting on a multitude to de&s;troy the Temple. This made &s;ome impre&s;|&s;ion at that time. But if the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s landing
<PB N="640" REF="654">
had not brought the &s;e&s;&s;ion to an early conclu&s;ion, that, and every thing el&s;e which the officious Courtiers were pro|jecting, would have certainly pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t important bu&s;ine&s;s that was before the Hou&s;e of Lords was the rever&s;ing the attainder of the Lord <HI>Stafford.</HI> It <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lords were more cautious.</NOTE> was &s;aid for it, that the witne&s;&s;es were now convicted of perjury, and therefore the re&s;toring the blood that was taint|ed by their evidence was a ju&s;t reparation. The proceed|ings in the matter of the Popi&s;h plot were chiefly founded on <HI>Oates</HI>'s di&s;covery, which was now judged to be a thread of perjury. This &s;tuck with the Lords, and would not go down. Yet they did ju&s;tice both to the Popi&s;h Lords then in the Tower, and to the Earl of <HI>Danby,</HI> who moved the Hou&s;e of Lords, that they might either be brought to their trial, or be &s;et at liberty. This was &s;ent by the Lords to the Hou&s;e of Commons, who returned an&s;wer, that they did not think fit to in&s;i&s;t on the impeachments. So upon that they were di&s;charged of them, and &s;et at liberty. Yet, tho' both Hou&s;es agreed in this of pro&s;ecuting the Popi&s;h plot no further, the Lords had no mind to rever&s;e and condemn pa&s;t proceedings.</P>
<P>But while all the&s;e things were in agitation, the Duke of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI> land|ed at <HI>Lime.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s landing brought the &s;e&s;&s;ion to a conclu&s;ion. As &s;oon as Lord <HI>Argile</HI> &s;ailed for <HI>Scotland,</HI> he &s;et about his de|&s;ign with as much ha&s;te as was po&s;&s;ible. Arms were bought, and a &s;hip was freighted for <HI>Bilbao</HI> in <HI>Spain.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> pawned all his jewels: But the&s;e could not rai&s;e much: And no money was &s;ent him out of <HI>England.</HI> So he was hurried into an ill de&s;igned inva&s;ion. The whole com|pany con&s;i&s;ted but of eighty two per&s;ons. They were all faithful to one another. But &s;ome &s;pies, whom <HI>Shelton</HI> the new Envoy &s;et on work, &s;ent him the notice of a &s;u&s;pected &s;hip &s;ailing out of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> with arms. <HI>Shelton</HI> neither under&s;tood the laws of <HI>Holland,</HI> nor advi&s;ed with tho&s;e who did: Otherwi&s;e he would have carried with him an order from the Admiralty of <HI>Holland,</HI> that &s;at at the <HI>Hague,</HI> to be made u&s;e of as the occa&s;ion &s;hould require. When he came to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and applied him&s;elf to the Magi&s;trates there, de&s;iring them to &s;top and &s;earch the &s;hip that he named, they found the &s;hip was already &s;ailed out of their port, and their juri&s;diction went no further. So he was forced to &s;end to the Admiralty at the <HI>Hague.</HI> But tho&s;e on board, hearing what he was come for, made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te. And, the wind favour|ing
<PB N="641" REF="655">
them, they got out of the <HI>Texel,</HI> before the order de|&s;ired could be brought from the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P>After a pro&s;perous cour&s;e, the Duke landed at <HI>Lime</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire:</HI> And he with his &s;mall company came a&s;hore with &s;ome order, but with too much day light, which di&s;covered how few they were.</P>
<P>The alarm was brought hot to <HI>London:</HI> Where, upon the <NOTE PLACE="marg">An act of Attainder pa&s;&s;ed a|gain&s;t him.</NOTE> general report and belief of the thing an act of Attainder pa&s;t both Hou&s;es in one day; &s;ome &s;mall oppo&s;ition being made by the Earl of <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> becau&s;e the evidence did not &s;eem clear enough for &s;o &s;evere a &s;entence, which was ground|ed on the notoriety of the thing. The &s;um of 5000 <HI>l.</HI> was &s;et on his head. And with that the &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament ended; which was no &s;mall happine&s;s to the Nation, &s;uch a body of men being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with doing &s;o little hurt. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth's Manife&s;to</HI> was long, and ill penned: Full of much black and dull malice. It was plainly <HI>Fergu|&s;on</HI>'s &s;tile, which was both tedious and ful&s;ome. It charged the King with the burning of <HI>London,</HI> the Popi&s;h plot, <HI>Godfrey</HI>'s murder, and the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s death: And to crown all, it was pretended, that the late King was poi&s;oned by his or|ders: It was &s;et forth, that the King's religion made him incapable of the Crown; that three &s;ub&s;equent Hou&s;es of Commons had voted his Exclu&s;ion: The taking away the old Charters, and all the hard things done in the la&s;t reign, were laid to his charge: The elections of the pre&s;ent Par|liament were al&s;o &s;et forth very odiou&s;ly, with great inde|cency of &s;tile: The Nation was al&s;o appealed to, when met in a free Parliament, to judge of the Duke's own preten&s;ions: And all &s;ort of liberty, both in temporals and &s;pirituals, was promi&s;ed to per&s;ons of all per&s;ua&s;ions.</P>
<P>Upon the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s landing, many of the coun|try <NOTE PLACE="marg">A rabble came and joined him.</NOTE> people came in to join him, but very few of the Gentry. He had quickly men enough about him to u&s;e all his arms. The Duke of <HI>Albermale,</HI> as Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> was &s;ent down to rai&s;e the Militia, and with them to make head again&s;t him. But their ill affection appeared very evi|dently: Many de&s;erted, and all were cold in the &s;ervice. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> had the whole country open to him for almo&s;t a fortnight, during which time he was very diligent in training and animating his men. His own behaviour was &s;o gentle and obliging, that he was ma&s;ter of all their hearts, as much as was po&s;&s;ible. But he quickly found, what it was to be at the head of undi&s;ciplined men, that knew nothing

of war, and that were not to be u&s;ed with rigour. Soon af|ter their landing, Lord <HI>Grey</HI> was &s;ent out with a &s;mall party. He &s;aw a few of the Militia, and he ran for it: But his men <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord <HI>Grey</HI>'s cowardi&s;e.</NOTE> &s;tood, and the Militia ran from them. Lord <HI>Grey</HI> brought a fal&s;e alarm, that was &s;oon found to be &s;o: For the men whom their leader had abandoned came back in good or|der. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was &s;truck with this, when he found that the per&s;on on whom he depended mo&s;t, and for whom he de&s;igned the command of the hor&s;e, had al|ready made him&s;elf infamous by his cowardi&s;e. He intended to join <HI>Fletcher</HI> with him in that command. But an unhap|py accident made it not convenient to keep him longer about him. He &s;ent him out on another party: And he, not being yet furni&s;hed with a hor&s;e, took the hor&s;e of one who had brought in a great body of men from <HI>Taunton.</HI> He was not in the way: So <HI>Fletcher,</HI> not &s;eeing him to a&s;k his leave, thought that all things were to be in common among them, that could advance the &s;ervice. After <HI>Fletcher</HI> had rid about, as he was ordered, as he returned, the owner of the hor&s;e he rode on, who was a rough and ill-bred man, reproached him in very injurious terms, for taking out his hor&s;e with|out his leave. <HI>Fletcher</HI> bore this longer than could have been expected from one of his impetuous temper. But the other per&s;i&s;ted in giving him foul language, and offered a &s;witch or a cane: Upon which he di&s;charged his pi&s;tol at him, and fatally &s;hot him dead. He went and gave the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI> an account of this, who &s;aw it was impo&s;&s;ible to keep him longer about him, without di&s;gu&s;ting and lo&s;ing the country people, who were coming in a body to demand ju&s;|tice. So he advi&s;ed him to go aboard the &s;hip, and to &s;ail on to <HI>Spain,</HI> whither &s;he was bound. By this means he was pre&s;erved for that time.</P>
<P><HI>Fergu&s;on</HI> ran among the people with all the fury of an en|raged man, that affected to pa&s;s for an enthu&s;ia&s;t, tho' all his performances that way were forced and dry. The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s great error was, that he did not in the fir&s;t heat venture on &s;ome hardy action, and then march either to <HI>Exeter</HI> or <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> where, as he would have found much wealth, &s;o he would have gained &s;ome reputation by it. But he lin|gred in exerci&s;ing his men, and &s;taid too long in the neigh|bourhood of <HI>Lime.</HI></P>
<P>By this means the King had time both to bring troops out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> after <HI>Argile</HI> was taken, and to &s;end to <HI>Hol|land</HI> for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scotch</HI> Regiments that were in the
<PB N="643" REF="659">
&s;ervice of the States; which the Prince &s;ent over very readi|ly, and offered his own per&s;on, and a greater force, if it was nece&s;&s;ary. The King received this with great expre&s;&s;ions of acknowledgment and kindne&s;s. It was very vi&s;ible, that he was much di&s;tracted in his thoughts, and that what appear|ance of courage &s;oever he might put on, he was inwardly full of apprehen&s;ions and fears. He dur&s;t not accept of the offer of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that the <HI>French</HI> made him: For by that he would have lo&s;t the hearts of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation. And he had no mind to be much obliged to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> or to let him into his coun&s;els or affairs. <HI>Prince George</HI> com|mitted a great error in not a&s;king the command of the Ar|my: For the command, how much &s;oever he might have been bound to the coun&s;els of others, would have given him &s;ome lu&s;tre; whereas his &s;taying at home in &s;uch time of danger brought him under much neglect.</P>
<P>The King could not choo&s;e wor&s;e than he did, when he <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earl of <HI>Fever&s;ham</HI> commanded the King's army.</NOTE> gave the command to the Earl of <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> who was a <HI>Frenchman</HI> by birth, and nephew to Mr. <HI>de Turenne.</HI> Both his brothers changing religion, tho' he continued &s;till a Pro|te&s;tant, made that his religion was not much tru&s;ted to. He was an hone&s;t, brave, and good natured man, but weak to a degree not ea&s;y to be conceived. And he conducted matters &s;o ill, that every &s;tep he made was like to prove fa|tal to the King's &s;ervice. He had no parties abroad. He got no intelligence: And was almo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed, and like to be de|feated, when he &s;eemed to be under no apprehen&s;ion, but was abed without any care or order. So that, if the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> had got but a very &s;mall number of good &s;ol|diers about him, the King's affairs would have fallen into great di&s;order.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> had almo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed Lord <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> and all about him, while they were abed. He got in between two bodies, into which the Army lay divided. He now &s;aw his error in lingring &s;o long. He began to want bread, and to be &s;o &s;traitned, that there was a nece&s;&s;ity of pu&s;hing for a &s;peedy deci&s;ion. He was &s;o mi&s;led in his march, that he lo&s;tan hour's time: And when he came nearthe Army, there was an incon&s;iderable ditch, in the pa&s;&s;ing which he lo&s;t &s;o much more time, that the officers had lei&s;ure to ri&s;e and be dre&s;&s;ed, now they had the alarm. And they put them&s;elves in order. Yet the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s foot &s;tood longer, and fought better than could have been expected; e&s;pecially, when the &s;mall body of hor&s;e they had ran upon the fir&s;t

charge, the blame of which was ca&s;t on the Lord <HI>Grey.</HI> The foot being thus for&s;aken, and galled by the cannon, did run at la&s;t. About a thou&s;and of them were killed on the &s;pot: And fifteen hundred were taken pri&s;oners. Their num|bers when fulle&s;t were between five and &s;ix thou&s;and. The <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI> de|feated.</NOTE> Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> left the field too &s;oon for a man of cou|rage, who had &s;uch high preten&s;ions: For a few days before he had &s;uffered him&s;elf to be called King, which did him no &s;ervice, even among tho&s;e that followed him. He rode to|wards <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire:</HI> And when his hor&s;e could carry him no further, he changed clothes with a &s;hepherd, and went as far as his legs could carry him, being accompanied only with a <HI>German,</HI> whom he had brought over with him. At la&s;t, when he could go no further, he lay down in a field where there was hay and &s;traw, with which they covered them|&s;elves, &s;o that they hoped to lie there un&s;een till night. Parties went out on all hands to take pri&s;oners. The &s;hep|herd was found by the Lord <HI>Lumley</HI> in the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI>'s clothes. So this put them on his track, and having &s;ome dogs with them they followed the &s;cent, and came to the place where the <HI>German</HI> was fir&s;t di&s;covered. And he immediately pointed to the place where the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth</HI> lay. So he was taken in a very indecent dre&s;s and <NOTE PLACE="marg">And taken.</NOTE> po&s;ture.</P>
<P>His body was quite &s;unk with fatigue: And his mind was now &s;o low, that he begged his life in a manner that agreed ill with the courage of the former parts of it. He called for pen, ink, and paper; and wrote to the Earl of <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> and both to the Queen, and the Queen <HI>Dowager,</HI> to intercede with the King for his life. The King's temper, as well as his intere&s;t, made it &s;o impo&s;&s;ible to hope for that, that it &s;hewed a great meanne&s;s in him to a&s;k it in &s;uch terms as he u&s;ed in his letters. He was carried up to <HI>Whitehall;</HI> where the King examined him in per&s;on, which was thought very indecent, &s;ince he was re&s;olved not to pardon him. He made new and unbecoming &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, and in&s;inuated a readine&s;s to change his religion: For he &s;aid, the King knew what his fir&s;t education was in religion. There were no di&s;coveries to be got from him; for the attempt was too ra&s;h to be well concerted, or to be &s;o deep laid that many were involved in the guilt of it. He was examined on <HI>Monday,</HI> and orders were given for his execution on <HI>Wed|ne&s;day.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="645" REF="661">
<HI>Turner</HI> and <HI>Ken,</HI> the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Ely</HI> and of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells,</HI> were ordered to wait on him. But he called for Dr. <HI>Tenni|&s;on.</HI> The Bi&s;hops &s;tudied to convince him of the &s;in of re|bellion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Soon after executed.</NOTE> He an&s;wered, he was &s;orry for the blood that was &s;hed in it: But he did not &s;eem to repent of the de&s;ign. Yet he confe&s;&s;ed that his Father had often told him, that there was no truth in the reports of his having married his Mother. This he &s;et under his hand, probably for his chil|drens &s;ake, who were then pri&s;oners in the Tower, that &s;o they might not be ill u&s;ed on his account. He &s;hewed a great neglect of his Duche&s;s. And her re&s;entments for his cour&s;e of life with the Lady <HI>Wentworth</HI> wrought &s;o much on her, that, tho' he de&s;ired to &s;peak privately with her, &s;he would have witne&s;&s;es to hear all that pa&s;t, to ju&s;tify her &s;elf, and to pre&s;erve her family. They parted very coldly. He only recommended to her the breeding their children in the Prote&s;tant Religion. The Bi&s;hops continued &s;till to pre&s;s on him a deep &s;en&s;e of the &s;in of rebellion; at which he grew &s;o unea&s;y, that he de&s;ired them to &s;peak to him of other matters. They next charged him with the &s;in of liv|ing with the Lady <HI>Wentworth</HI> as he had done. In that he ju&s;tified him&s;elf: He had married his Duche&s;s too young to give a true con&s;ent: He &s;aid, that Lady was a pious worthy woman, and that he had never lived &s;o well in all re&s;pects, as &s;ince his engagements with her. All the pains they took to convince him of the unlawfulne&s;s of that cour&s;e of life had no effect. They did certainly very well in di&s;charging their con&s;ciences, and &s;peaking &s;o plainly to him. But they did very ill to talk &s;o much of this matter, and to make it &s;o publick as they did; for divines ought not to repeat what they &s;ay to dying penitents, no more than what the penitents &s;ay to them. By this means the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> had little &s;atisfaction in them, and they had as little in him.</P>
<P>He was much better plea&s;ed with Dr. <HI>Tenni&s;on,</HI> who did very plainly &s;peak to him, with relation to his publick act|ings, and to his cour&s;e of life: But he did it in a &s;ofter and le&s;s peremptory manner. And having &s;aid all that he thought proper, he left tho&s;e points, in which he &s;aw he could not convince him, to his own con&s;cience, and turned to other things fit to be laid before a dying man. The Duke begged one day more of life with &s;uch repeated earne&s;tne&s;s, that as the King was much blamed for denying &s;o &s;mall a fa|vour, &s;o it gave occa&s;ion to others to believe, that he had &s;ome hope from a&s;trologers, that, if he out-lived that day,
<PB N="646" REF="662">
he might have a better fate. As long as he fancied there was any hope, he was too much un&s;ettled in his mind to be capable of any thing.</P>
<P>But when he &s;aw all was to no purpo&s;e, and that he mu&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">He died with great calm|ne&s;s.</NOTE> die, he complained a little that his death was hurried on &s;o fa&s;t. But all on the &s;udden he came into a compo&s;ure of mind, that &s;urpri&s;ed tho&s;e that &s;aw it. There was no affecta|tion in it. His whole behaviour was ea&s;y and calm, not with|out a decent cheerfulne&s;s. He prayed God to forgive all his &s;ins, unknown as well as known. He &s;eemed confident of the mercies of God, and that he was going to be happy with him. And he went to the place of execution on Tower Hill with an air of undi&s;turbed courage, that was grave and compo&s;ed. He &s;aid little there, only that he was &s;orry for the blood that was &s;hed: But he had ever meant well to the Nation. When he &s;aw the axe, he touched it, and &s;aid, it was not &s;harp enough. He gave the hangman but half the reward he intended; and &s;aid, if he cut off his head clea|verly, and not &s;o butcherly as he did the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el's,</HI> his man would give him the re&s;t. The executioner was in great di&s;order, trembling all over: So he gave him two or three &s;trokes without being able to fini&s;h the matter, and then flung the axe out of his hand. But the Sheriff forced him to take it up: And at three or four more &s;trokes he &s;evered his head from his body: And both were pre&s;ently buried in the Chapel of the Tower. Thus lived and died this unfortu|nate young man. He had &s;everal good qualities in him, and &s;ome that were as bad. He was &s;oft and gentle even to exce&s;s, and too ea&s;y to tho&s;e who had credit with him. He was both &s;incere and good natured, and under&s;tood war well. But he was too much given to plea&s;ure and to favou|rites.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Grey</HI> it was thought would go next. But he <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord <HI>Grey</HI> pardoned.</NOTE> had a great e&s;tate that by his death was to go over to his brother. So the Court re&s;olved to pre&s;erve him, till he &s;hould be brought to compound for his life. The Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> had 16000 <HI>l.</HI> of him. Others had &s;maller &s;hares. He was likewi&s;e obliged to tell all he knew, and to be a witne&s;s in order to the conviction of others, but with this a&s;&s;urance, that no body &s;hould die upon his evidence. So the Lord <HI>Brandon,</HI> &s;on to the Earl of <HI>Macclesfield,</HI> was convict|ed by his and &s;ome other evidence. Mr. <HI>Hambden</HI> was al&s;o brought on his trial. And he was told, that he mu&s;t expect no favour unle&s;s he would plead guilty. And he, knowing
<PB N="647" REF="663">
that legal evidence would be brought again&s;t him, &s;ubmitted to this; and begged his life with a meanne&s;s, of which he him&s;elf was &s;o a&s;hamed afterwards, that it gave his &s;pirits a depre&s;&s;ion and di&s;order that he could never quite ma&s;ter. And that had a terrible conclu&s;ion; for about ten years after he cut his own throat.</P>
<P>The King was now as &s;ucce&s;sful as his own heart could <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King was lifted up with his &s;ucce&s;&s;es.</NOTE> wi&s;h. He had held a &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament in both King|doms, that had &s;ettled his revenue: And now two ill prepar|ed and ill managed rebellions had &s;o broken all the party that was again&s;t him, that he &s;eemed &s;ecure in his Throne, and above the power of all his enemies. And certainly a reign that was now &s;o beyond expectation &s;ucce&s;sful in its fir&s;t &s;ix months &s;eemed &s;o well &s;ettled, that no ordinary mi&s;manage|ment could have &s;poiled &s;uch beginnings. If the King had ordered a &s;peedy execution of &s;uch per&s;ons, as were fit to be made publick examples, and had upon that granted a ge|neral indemnity, and if he had but covered his intentions till he had got thro' another &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, it is not ea&s;y to imagine with what advantage he might then have opened and pur&s;ued his de&s;igns.</P>
<P>But his own temper, and the fury of &s;ome of his Mini&s;|ters, <NOTE PLACE="marg">But it had an ill effect on his affairs.</NOTE> and the maxims of his Prie&s;ts, who were become en|thu&s;ia&s;tical upon this &s;ucce&s;s, and fancied that nothing could now &s;tand before him: All the&s;e concurred to make him lo&s;e advantages that were never to be recovered: For the &s;hews of mercy, that were afterwards put on, were looked on as an after-game, to retrieve that which was now lo&s;t. The Army was kept for &s;ome time in the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Counties, where both officers and &s;oldiers lived as in an enemy's country, and treated all that were believed to be ill affected to the King with great rudene&s;s and violence.</P>
<P><HI>Kirk,</HI> who had commanded long in <HI>Tangier,</HI> was become <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great cruel|ties commit|ted by his &s;oldiers.</NOTE> &s;o &s;avage by the neighbourhood of the <HI>Moors</HI> there, that &s;ome days after the battle he ordered &s;everal of the pri&s;oners to be hanged up at <HI>Taunton,</HI> without &s;o much as the form of law, he and his company looking on from an entertainment they were at. At every new health another pri&s;oner was hanged up. And they were &s;o brutal, that ob&s;erving the &s;haking of the legs of tho&s;e whom they hanged, it was &s;aid among them, they were dancing; and upon that mu&s;ick was called for. This was both &s;o illegal, and &s;o inhuman, that it might have been expected that &s;ome notice would have been taken of it. But <HI>Kirk</HI> was only chid for it. And it was &s;aid,
<PB N="648" REF="664">
that he had a particular order for &s;ome military executions: So that he could only be chid for the manner of it.</P>
<P>But, as if this had been nothing, <HI>Jefferies</HI> was &s;ent the <NOTE PLACE="marg">And much greater by <HI>Jefferies.</HI></NOTE> <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Circuit to try the pri&s;oners. His behaviour was be|yond any thing that was ever heard of in a civilized Nati|on. He was perpetually either drunk, or in a rage, liker a fury than the zeal of a Judge. He required the pri&s;oners to plead guilty. And in that ca&s;e he gave them &s;ome hope of favour, if they gave him no trouble: Otherwi&s;e he told them he would execute the letter of the law upon them in its ut|mo&s;t &s;everity. This made many plead guilty, who had a great defence in law. But he &s;hewed no mercy. He order|ed a great many to be hanged up immediately, without al|lowing them a minute's time to &s;ay their prayers. He hang|ed, in &s;everal places, about &s;ix hundred per&s;ons. The great|e&s;t part of the&s;e were of the meane&s;t &s;ort, and of no di&s;tinc|tion. The impieties with which he treated them, and his behaviour towards &s;ome of the Nobility and Gentry that were well affected, but came and pleaded in favour of &s;ome pri&s;oners, would have amazed one, if done by a <HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> in <HI>Turkey. England</HI> had never known any thing like it. The in&s;tances are too many to be reckoned up.</P>
<P>But that which brought all his exce&s;&s;es to be imputed to <NOTE PLACE="marg">With which the King was well plea&s;ed.</NOTE> the King him&s;elf, and to the orders given by him, was, that the King had a particular account of all his proceedings writ to him every day. And he took plea&s;ure to relate them in the drawing room to foreign Mini&s;ters, and at his table, calling it <HI>Jefferies</HI>'s campaign: Speaking of all he had done in a &s;tile, that neither became the Maje&s;ty, nor the merci|fulne&s;s, of a great Prince. <HI>Dykfield</HI> was at that time in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> one of the Emba&s;&s;adors whom the States had &s;ent over to congratulate the King's coming to the Crown. He told me, that the King talked &s;o often of the&s;e things in his hearing, that he wondered to &s;ee him break out into tho&s;e indecencies. And upon <HI>Jefferies</HI>'s coming back, he was created a Baron, and Peer of <HI>England:</HI> A dignity which, tho' anciently &s;ome Judges were rai&s;ed to it, yet in the&s;e later ages, as there was no example of it, &s;o it was thought in|con&s;i&s;tent with the character of a Judge.</P>
<P>Two executions were of &s;uch an extraordinary nature, that they de&s;erve a more particular recital. The King appre|hended <NOTE PLACE="marg">The execu|tions of two women.</NOTE> that many of the pri&s;oners had got into <HI>London,</HI> and were concealed there. So he &s;aid, tho&s;e who concealed them were the wor&s;t &s;ort of traitors, who endeavoured to pre&s;erve
<PB N="649" REF="665">
&s;uch per&s;ons to a better time. He had likewi&s;e a great mind to find out any among the rich merchants, who might af|ford great compo&s;itions to &s;ave their lives: For tho' there was much blood &s;hed, there was little booty got to reward tho&s;e who had &s;erved. Upon this the King declared, he would &s;ooner pardon the rebels, than tho&s;e who harboured them.</P>
<P>There was in <HI>London</HI> one <HI>Gount,</HI> a woman that was an Anabapti&s;t, who &s;pent a great part of her life in acts of charity, vi&s;iting the jayles, and looking after the poor of what per&s;ua&s;ion &s;oever they were. One of the rebels found her out, and &s;he harboured him in her hou&s;e; and was look|ing for an occa&s;ion of &s;ending him out of the Kingdom. He went about in the night, and came to hear what the King had &s;aid. So he, by an unheard of ba&s;ene&s;s, went and deli|vered him&s;elf, and accu&s;ed her that harboured him. She was &s;eized on, and tried. There was no witne&s;s to prove that &s;he knew that the per&s;on &s;he harboured was a rebel, but he him&s;elf: Her maid witne&s;&s;ed only, that he was enter|tained at her hou&s;e. But tho' the crime was her harbouring a traitor, and was proved only by this infamous wit|ne&s;s, yet the Judge charged the Jury to bring her in guilty, pretending that the maid was a &s;econd witne&s;s, tho' &s;he knew nothing of that which was the criminal part. She was condemned, and burnt, as the law directs in the ca&s;e of women convict of trea&s;on. She died with a con|&s;tancy, even to a cheerfulne&s;s, that &s;truck all that &s;aw it. She &s;aid, charity was a part of her religion, as well as faith: This at wor&s;t was the feeding an enemy: So &s;he hoped, &s;he had her reward with him, for who&s;e &s;ake &s;he did this &s;er|vice, how unworthy &s;oever the per&s;on was, that made &s;o ill a return for it: She rejoyced, that God had honoured her to be the fir&s;t that &s;uffered by fire in this reign; and that her &s;uffering was a martyrdom for that religion which was all love. <HI>Pen</HI> the Quaker told me, he &s;aw her die. She laid the &s;traw about her for burning her &s;peedily; and behaved her &s;elf in &s;uch a manner, that all the &s;pectators melted in tears.</P>
<P>The other execution was of a woman of greater quality: The Lady <HI>La&s;le.</HI> Her hu&s;band had been a Regicide, and was one of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Lords, and was called the Lord <HI>Li&s;le.</HI> He went at the time of the Re&s;toration beyond &s;ea, and liv|ed at <HI>Lan&s;anne.</HI> But three de&s;perate <HI>Iri&s;hmen,</HI> hoping by &s;uch a &s;ervice to make their fortunes, went thither, and killed him as he was going to Church; and being well mounted, and ill pur&s;ued, got into <HI>France.</HI> His Lady was known
<PB N="650" REF="666">
to be much affected with the King's death, and not ea&s;ily reconciled to her hu&s;band for the &s;hare he had in it. She was a woman of great piety and charity. The night after the action, <HI>Hicks,</HI> a violent preacher among the Di&s;&s;enters, and <HI>Neltharp,</HI> came to her hou&s;e. She knew <HI>Hicks,</HI> and treat|ed him civilly, not a&s;king from whence they came. But <HI>Hicks</HI> told what brought them thither; for they had been with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> Upon which &s;he went out of the room immediately, and ordered her chief &s;ervant to &s;end an information concerning them to the next Ju&s;tice of Peace, and in the mean while to &s;uffer them to make their e&s;cape. But before this could be done, a party came about the hou&s;e, and took both them, and her for harbouring them. <HI>Jefferies</HI> re&s;olved to make a &s;acrifice of her; and obtained of the King a promi&s;e that he would not pardon her. Which the King owned to the Earl of <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> when he, upon the offer of a 1000 <HI>l.</HI> if he could obtain her pardon, went and begged it. So &s;he was brought to her trial. No legal proof was brought, that &s;he knew that they were rebels: The names of the per&s;ons found in her hou&s;e were in no Proclamation: So there was no notice given to beware of them. <HI>Jefferies</HI> affirmed to the Jury upon his honour, that the per&s;ons had confe&s;&s;ed that they had been with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> This was the turning a witne&s;s again&s;t her, after which he ought not to have judged in the matter. And, tho' it was in&s;i&s;ted on, as a point of law, that till the per&s;ons found in her hou&s;e were convicted, &s;he could not be found guilty, yet <HI>Jefferies</HI> charged the Jury in a mo&s;t violent manner to bring her in guilty. All the audience was &s;trangely affected with &s;o unu&s;ual a behaviour in a Judge. Only the per&s;on mo&s;t concerned, the Lady her&s;elf, who was then pa&s;t &s;even|ty, was &s;o little moved at it, that &s;he fell a&s;leep. The Jury brought her in not guilty. But the Judge in great fury &s;ent them out again. Yet they brought her in a &s;econd time not guilty. Then he &s;eemed as in a tran&s;port of rage. He upon that threatned them with an attaint of Jury. And they, over|come with fear, brought her in the third time guilty. The King would &s;hew no other favour, but that he changed the &s;entence from burning to beheading. She died with great con&s;tancy of mind; and expre&s;&s;ed a joy, that &s;he thus &s;uffer|ed for an act of charity and piety.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of tho&s;e that had &s;uffered expre&s;&s;ed at their death <NOTE PLACE="marg">The behavi|our of tho&s;e who &s;uffer|ed.</NOTE> &s;uch a calm firmne&s;s, and &s;uch a zeal for their religion, which they believed was then in danger, that it made great impre&s;|&s;ions
<PB N="651" REF="667" MS="Y">
on the &s;pectators. Some ba&s;e men among them tried to &s;ave them&s;elves by accu&s;ing others. <HI>Goodenough,</HI> who had been Under-Sheriff of <HI>London</HI> when <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> was Sheriff, of|fered to &s;wear again&s;t <HI>Corni&s;h;</HI> and al&s;o &s;aid, that <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> had not di&s;covered all he knew. So <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI> to &s;ave him|&s;elf joined with <HI>Goodenough,</HI> to &s;wear <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> guilty of that for which the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> had &s;uffered. And this was driven on &s;o fa&s;t, that <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> was &s;eized on, tried, and executed within the week. If he had got a little time; the fal&s;hood of the evidence would have been proved from <HI>Rum&s;ey</HI>'s for|mer depo&s;ition, which appeared &s;o clearly &s;oon after his death, that his e&s;tate was re&s;tored to his family, and the witne&s;&s;es were lodged in remote pri&s;ons for their lives. <HI>Cor|ni&s;h</HI> at his death a&s;&s;erted his innocence with great vehe|mence; and with &s;ome acrimony complained of the methods taken to de&s;troy him. And &s;o they gave it out, that he died in a fit of fury. But <HI>Pen,</HI> who &s;aw the execution, &s;aid to me, there appeared nothing but a ju&s;t indignation that innocence might very naturally give. <HI>Pen</HI> might be well relied on in &s;uch matters, he being &s;o entirely in the King's intere&s;ts. He &s;aid to me, the King was much to be pitied, who was hurried into all this effu&s;ion of blood by <HI>Jefferies</HI>'s impetuous and cruel temper. But, if his own inclinations had not been bia&s;&s;ed that way, and if his Prie&s;ts had not thought it the intere&s;t of their party to let that butcher loo&s;e, by which &s;o many men that were like to oppo&s;e them were put out of the way, it is not to be imagined, that there would have been &s;uch a run of barbarous cruelty, and that in &s;o many in&s;tances.</P>
<P>It gave a general horror to the body of the Nation: And <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nation was much changed by this manage|ment.</NOTE> it let all people &s;ee, what might be expected from a reign that &s;eemed to delight in blood. Even &s;ome of the faire&s;t of Tories began to relent a little, and to think they had tru&s;ted too much, and gone too far. The King had rai&s;ed new regiments, and had given commi&s;&s;ions to Papi&s;ts. This was over-looked during the time of danger, in which all men's &s;ervice was to be made u&s;e of: And by law they might &s;erve three months. But now, as that time was near lap&s;ing, the King began to &s;ay, the laws for the two Te&s;ts were made on de&s;ign again&s;t him&s;elf: The fir&s;t was made to turn him out of the Admiralty, and the &s;econd to make way for the Exclu&s;ion: And, he added, that it was an affront to him to in&s;i&s;t on the ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e laws. So the&s;e per&s;ons notwith&s;tanding that act were continued in commi&s;&s;ion: And
<PB N="652" REF="668">
the King declared openly, that he mu&s;t look on all tho&s;e, who would not con&s;ent to the repeal of tho&s;e lawe, in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament, as his enemies.</P>
<P>The Courtiers began every where to declaim again&s;t them. It was &s;aid to be again&s;t the rights of the Crown to deny <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great di&s;|putes for and again&s;t the Te&s;ts.</NOTE> the King the &s;ervice of all his &s;ubjects, to be contrary to the dignity of Peerage to &s;ubject Peers to any other Te&s;ts than their allegiance, and that it was an in&s;ufferable affront done the King, to oblige all tho&s;e, whom he &s;hould employ, to &s;wear that his religion was idolatrous. On the other hand all the people &s;aw, that, if tho&s;e acts were not maintained; no employment would be given to any but Papi&s;ts, or to tho&s;e who gave hopes that they would change: And, if the Par|liament Te&s;t was taken off, then the way was opened to draw over &s;o many members of both Hou&s;es, as would be in time a majority, to bring on an entire change of the laws with relation to religion. As long as the Nation reckoned their Kings were true and &s;ure to their religion, there was no &s;uch need of tho&s;e Te&s;ts, while the giving employments was left free, and our Princes were like to give them only to tho&s;e of their own religion. But, &s;ince we had a Prince profe&s;&s;ing another religion, it &s;eemed the only &s;ecurity that was left to the Nation, and that the Te&s;ts &s;tood as a bar|rier to defend us from Popery. It was al&s;o &s;aid, that tho&s;e Te&s;ts had really quieted the minds of the greater part of the Na|tion, and had united them again&s;t the Exclu&s;ion; &s;ince they reckoned their religion was &s;afe by rea&s;on of them. The military men went in zealou&s;ly into tho&s;e notions; for they &s;aw, that, as &s;oon as the King &s;hould get rid of the Te&s;ts, they mu&s;t either change their religion, or lo&s;e their employ|ments. The Clergy, who for mo&s;t part had hitherto run in with fury to all the King's intere&s;ts, began now to open their eyes. Thus all on a &s;udden the temper of the Nation was much altered. The Marquis of <HI>Halifax</HI> did move in Council, that an order &s;hould be given to examine, whether all the officers in commi&s;&s;ion had taken the Te&s;t, or not. But none &s;econded him: So the motion fell. And now all endeavours were u&s;ed, to fix the repeal of the Te&s;ts in the &s;e&s;&s;ion that was coming on.</P>
<P>$word$ Some few converts were made at this time. The chief of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some change their religion.</NOTE> the&s;e were the Earl of <HI>Perth,</HI> and his brother the Earl of <HI>Mel&s;ord.</HI> Some differences fell in between the Duke of <HI>Queens|borough</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Perth.</HI> The latter thought the for|mer was haughty and violent, and that he u&s;ed him in too
<PB N="653" REF="669">
rious a manner. So they broke. At that time the King publi&s;hed the two papers found in his brother's &s;trong box. So the Earl of <HI>Perth</HI> was either overcome with the rea&s;ons in them, or he thought it would look well at Court, if he put his conver&s;ion upon the&s;e. He came up to complain of the Duke of <HI>Queensborough.</HI> And his brother going to meet him at <HI>Ware,</HI> he di&s;covered his de&s;ign to him, who &s;eemed at fir&s;t much troubled at it: But he plied him &s;o, that he prevailed on him to join with him in his pretended con|ver&s;ion, which he did with great &s;hews of devotion and zeal. But when his objections to the Duke of <HI>Queensborough</HI>'s ad|mini&s;tration were heard, they were &s;o &s;light, that the King was a&s;hamed of them; and all the Court justified the Duke of <HI>Queensborough.</HI> A repartee of the Marquis of <HI>Halifax</HI> was much talked of on this occa&s;ion. The Earl of <HI>Perth</HI> was taking pains to convince him, that he had ju&s;t grounds of complaint, and &s;eemed little concerned in the ill effect this might have on him&s;elf. The Marquis an&s;wered him, he needed fear nothing, <HI>His faith would make him whole:</HI> And it proved &s;o.</P>
<P>Before he declared his change, the King &s;eemed &s;o well <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of <HI>Queensbo|rough</HI> di&s;|graced.</NOTE> &s;atisfied with the Duke of <HI>Queensborough,</HI> that he was re&s;olv|ed to bring the Earl of <HI>Perth</HI> to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, otherwi&s;e to di&s;mi&s;s him. But &s;uch converts were to be encouraged. So the King, having declared him&s;elf too openly to recal that &s;o &s;oon, ordered them both to go back to <HI>Scotland;</HI> and &s;aid, he would &s;ignify his plea&s;ure to them when they &s;hould be there. It followed them down very quickly. The Duke of <HI>Queensborough</HI> was turned out of the Trea&s;ury, and it was put in Commi&s;&s;ion: And he, not to be too much irritated at once, was put fir&s;t in the Commi&s;&s;ion. And now it be|came &s;oon very vi&s;ible, that he had the &s;ecret no more; but that it was lodged between the two brothers, the Earls of <HI>Perth,</HI> and <HI>Melford.</HI> Soon after that, the Duke of <HI>Queens|borough</HI> was not only turned out of all his employments, but a de&s;ign was laid to ruin him. All per&s;ons were encouraged to bring accu&s;ations again&s;t him, either with relation to the admini&s;tration of the government, or of the Trea&s;ury. And, if any colourable matter could have been found again&s;t him, it was re&s;olved to have made him a &s;acrifice. This &s;udden hatred, after &s;o entire a confidence, was imputed to the &s;ug|ge&s;tions the Earl of <HI>Perth</HI> had made of his zeal again&s;t Po|pery, and of his having engaged all his friends to &s;tick firm in oppo&s;ition to it. It was &s;aid, there was no need of mak|ing
<PB N="654" REF="670">
&s;uch promi&s;es, as he had engaged the King to make to the Parliament of <HI>Scotland:</HI> No body de&s;ired or expected them: He only drove that matter on his own account: So it was fit to let all about the King &s;ee, what was to be looked for, if they pre&s;&s;ed any thing too &s;everely with rela|tion to religion.</P>
<P>But to leave <HI>Scotland,</HI> and return to <HI>England:</HI> The King, after he had declared that he would be &s;erved by none but <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King declared a|gain&s;t the Te&s;ts.</NOTE> tho&s;e who would vote for the repeal of the Te&s;ts, called for the Marquis of <HI>Halifax,</HI> and a&s;ked him, how he would vote in that matter. He very frankly an&s;wered, he would never con&s;ent to it: He thought, the keeping up tho&s;e laws was nece&s;&s;ary, even for the King's &s;ervice, &s;ince the Nation tru&s;ted &s;o much to them, that the publick quiet was chiefly pre&s;erved by that means. Upon this the King told him, that tho' he would never forget pa&s;t &s;ervices, yet &s;ince he could not be prevailed on in that particular, he was re&s;olv|ed to have all of a piece. So he was turned out. And the Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI> was made Lord Pre&s;ident, and continued &s;till Secretary of State. More were not que&s;tioned at that time, nor turned out: For it was hoped, that, &s;ince all men &s;aw what was to be expected if they &s;hould not comply with the King's intentions, this would have its full effect upon tho&s;e, who had no mind to part with their places.</P>
<P>The King re&s;olved al&s;o to model <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;o as to make <NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceedings in <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> that Kingdom a nur&s;ery for his army in <HI>England,</HI> and to be &s;ure at lea&s;t of an army there, while his de&s;igns were to go on more &s;lowly in the i&s;le of <HI>Britain.</HI> The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> bore an inveterate hatred to the Duke of <HI>Ormond:</HI> So he was re|called. But, to di&s;mi&s;s him with &s;ome &s;hew of re&s;pect, he was &s;till continued Lord Steward of the hou&s;hold. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> was declared Lord Lieutenant. But the Ar|my was put under the command of <HI>Talbot,</HI> who was made Earl of <HI>Tirconnell.</HI> And he began very &s;oon to model it anew. The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Armagh</HI> had continued Lord Chan|cellor of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and was in all points &s;o compliant to the Court, that even his religion came to be &s;u&s;pected on that ac|count. Yet, it &s;eemed, he was not thought thorough paced. So Sir <HI>Charles Porter,</HI> who was a zealous promoter of every thing that the King propo&s;ed, and was a man of ready wit, and being poor was thought a per&s;on fit to be made a Tool of, was declared Lord Chancellor of <HI>Ireland.</HI> To the&s;e the King &s;aid, he was re&s;olved to maintain the &s;ettlement of
<PB N="655" REF="671">
<HI>Ireland.</HI> They had authority to promi&s;e this, and to act pur|&s;uant to it. But, as both the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> and <HI>Porter</HI> were poor, it was hoped, that they would under&s;tand the King's intentions, and &s;ee thro' tho&s;e promi&s;es, that were made only to lay men a&s;leep; and that therefore they would not in&s;i&s;t too much on them, nor pur&s;ue them too far.</P>
<P>But now, before I come to relate the &s;hort &s;e&s;&s;ion of Par|liament <NOTE PLACE="marg">The per&s;e|cution in <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> that was abruptly broken off, I mu&s;t mention one great tran&s;action that went before it, and had no &s;mall in|fluence on all men's minds. And &s;ince I &s;aw that di&s;mal tragedy, which was at this time acted in <HI>France,</HI> I mu&s;t now change the &s;cene, and give &s;ome account of my &s;elf. When I re&s;olved to go beyond &s;ea, there was no choice to be made. So many exiles and outlawed per&s;ons were &s;cattered up and down the Towns of <HI>Holland,</HI> and other Provinces, that I &s;aw the danger of going where I was &s;ure many of them would come about me, and try to have involved me in guilt by coming into my company, that &s;o they might engage me into their de&s;igns. So I re&s;olved to go to <HI>France:</HI> And, if I found it not convenient to &s;tay there, I intended to go on to <HI>Geneva</HI> or <HI>Switzerland.</HI> I a&s;ked the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador, if I might be &s;afe there. He after &s;ome days, I &s;uppo&s;e after he had writ to the Court upon it, a&s;|&s;ured me, I &s;hould be &s;afe there; and that, if the King &s;hould a&s;k after me, timely notice &s;hould be given me, that I might go out of the way. So I went to <HI>Paris.</HI> And, there being many there whom I had rea&s;on to look on as &s;pies, I took a little hou&s;e, and lived by my &s;elf as privately as I could. I continued there till the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> that I went to <HI>Italy.</HI> I found the Earl of <HI>Mountague</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> with whom I conver&s;ed much, and got from him mo&s;t of the &s;ecrets of the Court, and of the negotiations he was en|gaged in. The King of <HI>France</HI> had been for many years weakning the whole Prote&s;tant intere&s;t there, and was then upon the la&s;t re&s;olution of recalling the edict of <HI>Nantes.</HI> And, as far as I could judge, the affairs of <HI>England</HI> gave the la&s;t &s;troke to that matter.</P>
<P>This year, of which I am now writing, mu&s;t ever be <NOTE PLACE="marg">A fatal year to the Pro|te&s;tant Reli|gion.</NOTE> remembred, as the mo&s;t fatal to the Prote&s;tant Religion. In <HI>February,</HI> a King of <HI>England</HI> declared him&s;elf a Papi&s;t. In <HI>June, Charles</HI> the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> dying without i&s;&s;ue, the Electoral dignity went to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> a mo&s;t bigotted Popi&s;h family. In <HI>October,</HI> the King of <HI>France</HI> re|called and vacated the edict of <HI>Nantes.</HI> And in <HI>December,</HI>
<PB N="656" REF="672">
the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> being brought to it, not only by the per|&s;ua&s;ions, but even by the threatnings of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> recalled the edict that his father had granted to the <HI>Vau|dois.</HI> So it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that this was a very critical year. And I have ever reckoned this the fifth great cri&s;is of the Prote&s;tant Religion.</P>
<P>For &s;ome years the Prie&s;ts were every where making conver&s;ions in <HI>France.</HI> The hopes of pen&s;ions and prefer|ment wrought on many. The plau&s;ible colours, that the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux,</HI> then Bi&s;hop of <HI>Condom,</HI> put on all the er|rors of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> furni&s;hed others with excu&s;es for changing. Many thought, they mu&s;t change at la&s;t, or be quite undone: For the King &s;eemed to be engaged to go thro' with the matter, both in compliance with the &s;hadow of con&s;cience that he &s;eemed to have, which was to fol|low implicitly the conduct of his Confe&s;&s;or, and of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> he him&s;elf being ignorant in tho&s;e matters beyond what can be well imagined; and becau&s;e his glory &s;eemed al&s;o concerned to go thro' with every thing that he had once begun.</P>
<P>Old <HI>Rouvigny,</HI> who was the Deputy General of the Churches, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rouvigny</HI>'s behaviour.</NOTE> told me, that he was long deceived in his opinion of the King. He knew he was not naturally bloody. He &s;aw his gro&s;s ignorance in tho&s;e matters. His bigottry could not ri&s;e from any inward principle. So for many years he flat|tered him&s;elf with the hopes, that the de&s;ign&punc; would go on &s;o &s;lowly, that &s;ome unlooked for accident might defeat it. But after the peace of <HI>Nimeguen</HI> he &s;aw &s;uch &s;teps made with &s;o much precipitation, that he told the King he mu&s;t beg a full audience of him upon that &s;ubject. He gave him one that la&s;ted &s;ome hours. He came well prepared. He told him, what the State of <HI>France</HI> was during the wars in his Father's reign; how happy <HI>France</HI> had been now for fifty years, occa&s;ioned chiefly by the quiet it was in with relati|on to tho&s;e matters. He gave him an account of their num|bers, their indu&s;try and wealth, their con&s;tant readine&s;s to advance the revenue, and that all the quiet he had with the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> was chiefly owning to them: If they were rooted out, the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> would govern as ab&s;o|lutely in <HI>France,</HI> as it did in <HI>Spain.</HI> He de&s;ired leave to undeceive him, if he was made believe they would all change, as &s;oon as he engaged his authority in the matter: Many would go out of the Kingdom, and carry their wealth and indu&s;try into other countries. And by a &s;cheme of particu|lars
<PB N="657" REF="673">
he reckoned how far that would go. In fine, he &s;aid, it would come to the &s;hedding of much blood: Many would &s;uffer, and others would be precipitated into de&s;perate cour&s;es. So that the mo&s;t glorious of all reigns would be in conclu&s;ion disfigured and defaced, and become a &s;cene of blood and horror. He told me, as he went thro' the&s;e matters the King &s;eemed to hearken to him very attentively. But he perceived they made no impre&s;&s;ion: For the King never a&s;ked any particulars, or any explanation, but let him go on. And, when he had ended, the King &s;aid, he took his free|dom well, &s;ince it flowed from his zeal to his &s;ervice. He be|lieved all that he had told him, of the prejudice it might do him in his affairs: Only he thought, it would not go to the &s;hedding of blood. But he &s;aid, he con&s;idered him|&s;elf as &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ably bound to endeavour the conver&s;ion of all his &s;ubjects, and the extirpation of here&s;y, that if the doing it &s;hould require that with one hand he &s;hould cut off the other, he would &s;ubmit to that. After this <HI>Rou|vigny</HI> gave all his friends hints of what they were to look for. Some were for flying out into a new civil war. But, their chief confidence being in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they expected from <HI>England,</HI> he, who knew what our Princes were, and had rea&s;on to believe that King <HI>Charles</HI> was at lea&s;t a cold Prote&s;tant, if not a &s;ecret Papi&s;t, and knew that the States would not embroil their affairs in a&s;&s;i&s;ting them, their max|ims rather leading them to connive at any thing that would bring great numbers and much wealth into their Country than to oppo&s;e it, was again&s;t all motions of that kind. He reckoned, tho&s;e ri&s;ings would be &s;oon cru&s;ht, and &s;o would precipitate their ruin with &s;ome colour of ju&s;tice. He was much cen&s;ured for this by &s;ome hot men among them, as having betrayed them to the Court. But he was very un|ju&s;tly blamed, as appeared both by his own conduct, and by his &s;ons; who was received at fir&s;t into the &s;urvivance of being Deputy General for the Churches, and afterwards, at his Father's de&s;ire, had that melancholy po&s;t given him, in which he daily &s;aw new inju&s;tices done, and was only &s;uffered, for form's &s;ake, to inform again&s;t them, but with no hope of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The Father did, upon King <HI>Charle</HI>'s death, write a let|ter <NOTE PLACE="marg">He came over to <HI>Eng|land.</HI></NOTE> of congratulation to the King, who wrote him &s;uch an obliging an&s;wer, that upon it he wrote to his niece the Lady <HI>Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> that, having &s;uch a&s;&s;urances given him by the King of a high &s;en&s;e of his former &s;ervices, he re&s;olved to
<PB N="658" REF="674">
come over, and beg the re&s;toring her &s;on's honour. The Marquis of <HI>Halifax</HI> did pre&s;ently apprehend, that this was a blind, and that the King of <HI>France</HI> was &s;ending him over to penetrate into the King's de&s;igns; &s;ince from all hands intimations were brought of the promi&s;es that he made to the Mini&s;ters of the other Princes of <HI>Europe.</HI> So I was or|dered to u&s;e all endeavours to divert him from coming over: His niece had indeed begged that journey of him, when &s;he hoped it might have &s;aved her hu&s;band's life, but &s;he would not venture to de&s;ire the journey on any other con&s;iderati|on, con&s;idering his great age, and that her &s;on was then but five years old. I pre&s;&s;ed this &s;o much on him, that, finding him fixed in his re&s;olution, I could not hinder my &s;elf from &s;u&s;pecting, that &s;uch a high act of friend&s;hip, in a man &s;ome years pa&s;t four&s;core, had &s;omewhat under it: And it was &s;aid, that, when he took leave of the King of <HI>France,</HI> he had an au|dience of two hours of him. But this was a fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;tion: And I was a&s;&s;ured afterwards that he came over only in friend|&s;hip to his niece, and that he had no directions nor me&s;&s;ages from the Court of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>He came over, and had &s;everal audiences of the King, who u&s;ed him with great kindne&s;s, but did not grant him that which he &s;aid he came for: Only he gave him a ge|neral promi&s;e of doing it in a proper time.</P>
<P>But whether the Court of <HI>France</HI> was &s;atisfied, by the con|ver&s;ation that <HI>Rouvigny</HI> had with the King, that they needed apprehend nothing from <HI>England;</HI> or whether the King's be|ing now &s;o &s;ettled on the Throne made them conclude, that the time was come of repealing the edicts, is not certain: Mr. <HI>de Louvoy,</HI> &s;eeing the King &s;o &s;et on the matter, pro|po&s;ed to him a method, which he believed would &s;horten the work, and do it effectually: Which was, to let loo&s;e &s;ome bodies of Dragoons to live upon the Prote&s;tants on di&s;creti|on. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dragoons &s;ent to live on di&s;creti|on upon the Prote&s;tants.</NOTE> They were put under no re&s;traint, but only to avoid rapes, and the killing them. This was begun in <HI>Bearn.</HI> And the people were &s;o &s;truck with it, that, &s;eeing they were to be eat up fir&s;t, and, if that prevailed not, to be ca&s;t in pri&s;on, when all was taken from them, till they &s;hould change, and be|ing required only to promi&s;e to reunite them&s;elves to the Church, they, overcome with fear, and having no time for con|&s;ulting together, did univer&s;ally comply. This did &s;o animate the Court, that, upon it the &s;ame methods were taken in mo&s;t places of <HI>Guienne, Languedoc,</HI> and <HI>Dauphin&egrave;,</HI> where the great|e&s;t numbers of the Prote&s;tants were. A di&s;mal con&s;ternati|on
<PB N="659" REF="675">
and feeblene&s;s ran thro' mo&s;t of them, &s;o that great num|bers yielded. Upon which the King, now re&s;olved to go <NOTE PLACE="marg">Many of them yielded thro' fear.</NOTE> thro' with what had been long projected, publi&s;hed the edict repealing the edict of <HI>Nantes,</HI> in which (tho' that edict was declared to be a perpetual and irrevocable law) he &s;et forth, that it was only intended to quiet matters by it, till more effectual ways &s;hould be taken for the conver&s;ion of Here|ticks. He al&s;o promi&s;ed in it, that, tho' all the publick ex|erci&s;es of that religion were now &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, yet tho&s;e of that per&s;ua&s;ion who lived quietly &s;hould not be di&s;turbed on that account, while at the &s;ame time not only the Dragoons, but all the Clergy, and the bigots of <HI>France,</HI> broke out into all the in&s;tances of rage and fury again&s;t &s;uch as did not change upon their being required in the King's name to be of his religion; for that was the &s;tile every where.</P>
<P>Men and women of all ages, who would not yield, were <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great cruel|ty every where.</NOTE> not only &s;tript of all they had, but kept long from &s;leep, driven about from place to place, and hunted out of their retirements. The women were carried into Nunneries, in many of which they were almo&s;t &s;tarved, whipt, and bar|barou&s;ly treated. Some few of the Bi&s;hops, and of the &s;e|cular Clergy, to make the matter ea&s;ier, drew formularies, importing that they were re&s;olved to reunite them&s;elves to the Catholick Church, and that they renounced the errors of <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin.</HI> People in &s;uch extremities are ea&s;y to put a &s;tretched &s;en&s;e on any words, that may give them pre&s;ent relief. So it was &s;aid, what harm was it to promi&s;e to be united to the Catholick Church: And the renouncing tho&s;e men's errors did not renounce their good and &s;ound doctrine. But it was very vi&s;ible, with what intent tho&s;e &s;ub&s;criptions or promi&s;es were a&s;ked of them: So their com|pliance in that matter was a plain equivocation. But, how weak and faulty &s;oever they might be in this, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, here was one of the mo&s;t violent per&s;ecuti|ons that is to be found in hi&s;tory. In many re&s;pects it ex|ceeded them all, both in the &s;everal inventions of cruelty, and in its long continuance. I went over the greate&s;t part of <HI>France</HI> while it was in its hotte&s;t rage, from <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> to <HI>Montpelier,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Lions,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Geneva.</HI> I &s;aw and knew &s;o many in&s;tances of their inju&s;tice and violence, that it exceeded even what could have been well imagined; for all men &s;et their thoughts on work to in|vent new methods of cruelty. In all the Towns thro' which I pa&s;t, I heard the mo&s;t di&s;mal accounts of tho&s;e things po&s;|&s;ible;
<PB N="660" REF="676">
but chiefly at <HI>Valence,</HI> where one <HI>Dherapine</HI> &s;eemed to exceed even the furies of Inqui&s;itors. One in the &s;treets could have known the new converts, as they were pa&s;&s;ing by them, by a cloudy dejection that appeared in their looks and deportment. Such as endeavoured to make their e&s;cape, and were &s;eized, (for guards and &s;ecret agents were &s;pread along the whole roads and frontier of <HI>France,)</HI> were, if men, condemned to the gallies, and, if women, to mona&s;teries. To compleat this cruelty, orders were given that &s;uch of the new converts, as did not at their death receive the Sa|crament, &s;hould be denied burial, and that their bodies &s;hould be left where other dead carca&s;es were ca&s;t out, to be de|voured by wolves or dogs. This was executed in &s;everal places with the utmo&s;t barbarity: And it gave all people &s;o much horror, that, finding the ill effect of it, it was let fall. This hurt none, but &s;truck all that &s;aw it, even with more horror than tho&s;e &s;ufferings that were more felt. The fury that appeared on this occa&s;ion did &s;pread it &s;elf with a &s;ort of contagion: For the Intendants and other officers, that had been mild and gentle in the former parts of their life, &s;eem|ed now to have laid a&s;ide the compa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tians, the breeding of Gentlemen, and the common impre&s;&s;ions of hu|manity. The greate&s;t part of the Clergy, the Regulars e&s;pe|cially, were &s;o tran&s;ported with the zeal that their King &s;hewed on this occa&s;ion, that their &s;ermons were full of the mo&s;t inflamed eloquence that they could invent, magnifying their King in &s;trains too indecent and bla&s;phemous to be mentioned by me.</P>
<P>I &s;taid at <HI>Paris</HI> till the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t. Barrillon</HI> &s;ent <NOTE PLACE="marg">I went into <HI>Italy.</HI></NOTE> to me to look to my &s;elf; for the King had let &s;ome words fall importing his &s;u&s;picion of me, as concerned in the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s bu&s;ine&s;s. Whether this was done on de&s;ign, to &s;ee if &s;uch an in&s;inuation could fright me away, and &s;o bring me under &s;ome appearance of guilt, I cannot tell: For in that time every thing was deceitfully managed. But I, who knew that I was not &s;o much as guilty of concealment, re&s;olved not to &s;tir from <HI>Paris</HI> till the rebellion was over, and that the pri&s;oners were examined, and tried. When that was done, <HI>Stouppe,</HI> a Bri|gadier General, told me, that Mr. <HI>de Louvoy</HI> had &s;aid to him that the King was re&s;olved to put an end to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Hu|guenots</HI> that &s;ea&s;on: And, &s;ince he was re&s;olved not to change, he advi&s;ed him to make a <HI>Tour</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> that he might not &s;eem to do any thing that oppo&s;ed the King's &s;ervice. <HI>Stouppe</HI> told me this in confidence. So we re&s;olved to make that
<PB N="661" REF="677">
journey together. Some thought it was too bold an adven|ture in me, after what I had written and acted in the matters of religion, to go to <HI>Rome.</HI> But others, who judged better, thought I ran no hazard in going thither: For, be&s;ides the high civility with which all &s;trangers are treated there, they were at that time in &s;uch hopes of gaining <HI>England,</HI> that it was not rea&s;onable to think, that they would rai&s;e the ap|prehen&s;ions of the Nation, by u&s;ing any that belonged to it ill: And the de&s;troying me would not do them the&s;ervice, that could in any &s;ort balance the prejudice that might ari&s;e from the noi&s;e it would make. And indeed I met with &s;o high a civility at <HI>Rome,</HI> that it fully ju&s;tified this opinion.</P>
<P>Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> the eleventh, <HI>Ode&s;calchi,</HI> knew who I was <NOTE PLACE="marg">And was well receiv|ed at <HI>Rome.</HI></NOTE> the day after I came to <HI>Rome.</HI> And he ordered the Captain of the <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> guards to tell <HI>Stouppe,</HI> that he had heard of me, and would give me a private audience abed, to &s;ave me from the ceremony of the <HI>Pantoufle.</HI> But I knew the noi&s;e that this would make: So I re&s;olved to avoid it, and excu&s;ed it upon my &s;peaking <HI>Italian</HI> &s;o ill as I did. But Cardinal <HI>How|ard</HI> and the Cardinal <HI>d'E&s;trees</HI> treated me with great freedom. The latter talked much with me concerning the orders in our Church, to know whether they had been brought down to us by men truly ordained, or not: For, he &s;aid, they ap|prehended things would be much more ea&s;ily brought about, if our orders could be e&s;teemed valid, tho' given in here&s;y and &s;chi&s;m. I told him, I was glad they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with any opinion that made the reconciliation more difficult; but, as for the matter of fact, nothing was more certain, than that the ordinations in the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s reign were canonical and regular. He &s;eemed to be per&s;uaded of the truth of this, but lamented that it was impo&s;&s;ible to bring the <HI>Romans</HI> to think &s;o.</P>
<P>Cardinal <HI>Howard</HI> &s;hewed me all his letters from <HI>England,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cardinal <HI>Howard</HI>'s freedom with me.</NOTE> by which I &s;aw, that tho&s;e who wrote to him reckoned, that their de&s;igns were &s;o well laid, that they could not mi&s;carry. They thought, they &s;hould certainly carry every thing in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament. There was a high &s;train of in&s;olence in their letters: And they reckoned, they were &s;o &s;ure of the King, that they &s;eemed to have no doubt left of their &s;ucceeding in the reduction of <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Ro|mans</HI> and <HI>Italians</HI> were much troubled at all this: For they were under &s;uch apprehen&s;ions of the growth of the <HI>French</HI> power, and had conceived &s;uch hopes of the King of <HI>England</HI>'s putting a &s;top to it, that they were &s;orry
<PB N="662" REF="678">
to &s;ee the King engage him&s;elf &s;o in the de&s;ign of chang|ing the religion of his &s;ubjects, which they thought would create him &s;o much trouble at home, that he would neither have lei&s;ure nor &s;trength to look after the common concerns of <HI>Europe.</HI> The Cardinal told me, that all the advices writ over from thence to <HI>England</HI> were for &s;low, calm, and mo|derate cour&s;es. He &s;aid, he wi&s;hed he was at liberty to &s;hew me the copies of them: But he &s;aw violent cour&s;es were more acceptable, and would probably be followed. And he added, that the&s;e were the production of <HI>England,</HI> far diffe|rent from the coun&s;els of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>He al&s;o told me, that they had not in&s;truments enough to work with: For, tho' they were &s;ending over all that were capable of the Mi&s;&s;ion, yet he expected no great matters from them. Few of them &s;poke true <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> They came over young, and retained all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that they brought over with them, which was only the language of boys: But, their education being among &s;trangers, they had formed them&s;elves &s;o upon that model, that really they preached as <HI>Frenchmen</HI> or <HI>Italians</HI> in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> words; of which he was every day warning them, for he knew this could have no good effect in <HI>England.</HI> He al&s;o &s;poke with great &s;en&s;e of the proceedings in <HI>France,</HI> which he apprehended would have very ill con&s;equences in <HI>England.</HI> I &s;hall only add one other particular, which will &s;hew the &s;oft temper of that good natured man.</P>
<P>He u&s;ed me in &s;uch a manner, that it was much ob&s;erved by many others. So two <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen de&s;ired a note from me to introduce them to him. Their de&s;ign was to be furni&s;hed with Reliques; for he was then the Cardinal that looked after that matter. One evening I came in to him as he was very bu&s;y in giving them &s;ome Reliques. So I was called in to &s;ee them: And I whi&s;pered to him in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that it was &s;omewhat odd, that a Prie&s;t of the Church of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould be at <HI>Rome</HI> helping them off with the ware of <HI>Babylon.</HI> He was &s;o plea&s;ed with this, that he repeated it to the others in <HI>French;</HI> and told the <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> that they &s;hould tell their countrymen, how bold the hereticks, and how mild the Cardinals were at <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;taid in <HI>Rome,</HI> till Prince <HI>Borghe&s;e</HI> came to me, and told me it was time for me to go. I had got great acquaintance there. And, tho' I did not provoke any to di&s;cour&s;e of points of controver&s;y, yet I defended my &s;elf again&s;t all tho&s;e who attacked me, with the &s;ame freedom that I had done in
<PB N="663" REF="679">
other places. This began to be taken notice of. So upon the fir&s;t intimation I came away, and returned by <HI>Mar&s;eil|les.</HI> And then I went thro' tho&s;e <HI>Southern</HI> Provinces of <HI>France,</HI> that were at that time a &s;cene of barbarity and cru|elty.</P>
<P>I intended to have gone to <HI>Orange:</HI> But <HI>Te&s;s&egrave;</HI> with a body <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruelties in <HI>Orange.</HI></NOTE> of Dragoons was then quartered over that &s;mall Principality, and was treating the Prote&s;tants there in the &s;ame manner that the <HI>French</HI> &s;ubjects were treated in other parts. So I went not in, but pa&s;t near it, and had this account of that mat|ter from &s;ome that were the mo&s;t con&s;iderable men of the Prin|cipality. Many of the neighbouring places fled thither from the per&s;ecution: Upon which a letter was writ to the govern|ment there, in the name of the King of <HI>France,</HI> requiring them to put all his &s;ubjects out of their territory. This was hard. Yet they were too naked and expo&s;ed to di&s;pute any thing with tho&s;e who could command every thing. So they ordered all the <HI>French</HI> to withdraw: Upon which <HI>Te&s;s&egrave;,</HI> who commanded in tho&s;e parts, wrote to them, that the King would be well &s;atisfied with the obedience they had given his orders. They upon this were quiet, and thought there was no danger. But the next morning <HI>Te&s;s&egrave;</HI> marched his Dra|goons into the Town, and let them loo&s;e upon them, as he had done upon the &s;ubjects of <HI>France.</HI> And they plied as feebly as mo&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> had done. This was done while that Principality was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> pur&s;uant to an article of the treaty of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> of which the King of <HI>England</HI> was the guarantee. Whether the <HI>French</HI> had the King's con&s;ent to this, or if they pre|&s;umed upon it, was not known. It is certain, he ordered two memorials to be given in at that Court, complaining of it in very high terms. But nothing followed on it. And, &s;ome months after, the King of <HI>France</HI> did unite <HI>Orange</HI> to the re&s;t of <HI>Provence,</HI> and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all the rights it had, as a di&s;tinct Principality. The King writ upon it to the Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange,</HI> that he could do no more in that mat|ter, unle&s;s he &s;hould declare war upon it; which he could not think fit for a thing of &s;uch &s;mall importance.</P>
<P>But now the &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament drew on. And there <NOTE PLACE="marg">Another &s;e&s;|&s;ion of Par|liament.</NOTE> was a great expectation of the i&s;&s;ue of it. For &s;ome weeks before it met there was &s;uch a number of Refugees coming over every day, who &s;et about a mo&s;t di&s;mal recital of the per&s;ecution in <HI>France,</HI> and that in &s;o many in&s;tances that were crying and odious, that, tho' all endeavours were u&s;ed
<PB N="664" REF="680">
to le&s;&s;en the clamour this had rai&s;ed, yet the King did not &s;tick openly to condemn it, as both unchri&s;tian and unpo|litick. He took pains to clear the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> of it, and laid the blame of it chiefly on the King, on <HI>Madame de Maintenon,</HI> and the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris.</HI> He &s;poke often of it with &s;uch vehemence, that there &s;eemed to be an affectation in it. He did more. He was very kind to the Refugees. He was li|beral to many of them. He ordered a brief for a charitable collection over the Nation for them all: Upon which great &s;ums were &s;ent in. They were depo&s;ited in good hands, and well di&s;tributed. The King al&s;o ordered them to be deni&s;ed without paying fees, and gave them great immunities. So that in all there came over fir&s;t and la&s;t between forty and fifty thou&s;and of that Nation. Here was &s;uch a real argu|ment of the cruel and per&s;ecuting &s;pirit of Popery, where|&s;oever it prevailed, that few could re&s;i&s;t this conviction. So that all men confe&s;&s;ed, that the <HI>French</HI> per&s;ecution came very &s;ea&s;onably to awaken the Nation, and open mens eyes in &s;o critical a conjuncture: For upon this &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament all did depend.</P>
<P>When it was opened, the King told them how happy his <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's &s;peech a|gain&s;t the Te&s;t.</NOTE> forces had been in reducing a dangerous rebellion, in which it had appeared, how weak and in&s;ignificant the Militia was: And therefore he &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping up an Army for all their &s;ecurity. He had put &s;ome in commi&s;&s;ion, of who&s;e loyalty he was well a&s;&s;ured: And they had &s;erved him &s;o well, that he would not put that affront on them, and on him&s;elf, to turn them out. He told them, all the world &s;aw, and they had felt the happine&s;s of a good under&s;tanding between him and his Parliament: So he hop|ed, nothing &s;hould be done on their part to interrupt that; as he, on his own part, would ob&s;erve all that he had pro|mi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Thus he fell upon the two mo&s;t unacceptable points that he could have found out; which were, a &s;tanding Army, and a violation of the Act of the Te&s;t. There were &s;ome debates in the Hou&s;e of Lords about thanking the King for his &s;peech. It was pre&s;&s;ed by the Courtiers, as a piece of re&s;pect that was always paid. To this &s;ome an&s;wered, that was done when there were gracious a&s;&s;urances given. Only the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> &s;aid, he was for giving thanks, be|cau&s;e the King had &s;poken out &s;o plainly, and warned them of what they might look for. It was carried in the Hou&s;e to make an addre&s;s of thanks for the &s;peech. The Lord
<PB N="665" REF="681">
<HI>Guilfo~rd, North,</HI> was now dead. He was a crafty and de&s;ign|ing man. He had no mind to part with the great Seal: And yet he &s;aw, he could not hold it without an entire compli|ance with the plea&s;ure of the Court. An appeal again&s;t a decree of his had been brought before the Lords in the former &s;e&s;&s;ion: And it was not only rever&s;ed with many &s;evere reflec|tions on him that made it, but the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> who hated him becau&s;e he had endeavoured to detract from his father's memory, had got together &s;o many in&s;tances of his ill admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, that he expo&s;ed him &s;everely for it. And, it was believed, that gave the cri&s;is to the un|ea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;traction of mind he was labouring under. He langui&s;hed for &s;ome time; and died de&s;pi&s;ed, and ill thought of by the whole Nation.</P>
<P>Nothing but his &s;ucce&s;&s;or made him be remembred with <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jefferies</HI> made Lord Chancellor.</NOTE> regret: For <HI>Jefferies</HI> had the Seals. He had been made a Peer while he was Chief Ju&s;tice, which had not been done for &s;ome ages: But he affected to be an original in every thing. A day or two after the &s;e&s;&s;ion was opened, the Lords went upon the con&s;ideration of the King's &s;peech: And, when &s;ome began to make remarks upon it, they were told, that by giving thanks for the &s;peech they had precluded them|&s;elves from finding fault with any part of it. This was re|jected with indignation, and put an end to that comple|ment of giving thanks for a &s;peech when there was no &s;pecial rea&s;on for it. The Lords <HI>Halifax, Nottingham,</HI> and <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> were the chief arguers among the temporal Lords. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> &s;poke often likewi&s;e: And twice or thrice he &s;aid, he &s;poke not only his own &s;en&s;e, but the &s;en&s;e of that whole Bench. They &s;aid, the Te&s;t was now the be&s;t fence they had for their religion: If they gave up &s;o great a point, all the re&s;t would &s;oon follow: And if the King might by his authority &s;uper&s;ede &s;uch a law, fortified with &s;o many clau&s;es, and above all with that of an incapacity, it was in vain to think of law any more: The government would become arbitrary and ab&s;olute. <HI>Jef|feries</HI> began to argue in his rough manner: But he was &s;oon taken down; it appearing, that how furiou&s;ly &s;oever he raved on the Bench, where he played the tyrant, yet where others might &s;peak with him on equal terms, he was a very contemptible man: And he received as great a mortificati|on, as &s;uch a brutal man as he was capable of.</P>
<P>But as the &s;cene lay in the Hou&s;e of Commons, &s;o the debates there were more important. A project was offered
<PB N="666" REF="682">
for making the Militia more u&s;eful in order to the di&s;band|ing the Army. But, to oppo&s;e that, the Court &s;hewed, how great a danger we had lately e&s;caped, and how much of an <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hou&s;e of Com|mons ad|dre&s;s the King for ob|&s;erving the law.</NOTE> ill leaven yet remained in the Nation, &s;o that it was nece&s;|&s;ary a force &s;hould be kept up. The Court moved for a &s;ub&s;idy, the King having been at much extraordinary charge in reducing the late rebellion. Many, that were re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ert the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Te&s;t with great firmne&s;s, thought, the voting of money fir&s;t was the decente&s;t way of manag|ing the oppo&s;ition to the Court: Whereas others oppo&s;ed this, having often ob&s;erved, that the voting of money was the giving up the whole &s;e&s;&s;ion to the Court. The Court wrought on many weak men with this topick, that the only way to gain the King, and to di&s;po&s;e him to agree to them in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Te&s;t, was to begin with the &s;upply. This had &s;o great an effect, that it was carried only by one vote to con&s;ider the King's &s;peech, before they &s;hould pro|ceed to the &s;upply. It was under&s;tood, that when they re|ceived &s;atisfaction in other things, they were re&s;olved to give 500000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>They went next to con&s;ider the Act about the Te&s;t, and the violations of it, with the King's &s;peech upon that head. The rea&s;oning was clear and full on the one hand. The Court offered nothing on the other hand in the way of ar|gument, but the danger of offending the King, and of rai&s;|ing a mi&s;under&s;tanding between him and them. So the whole Hou&s;e went in unanimou&s;ly into a vote for an addre&s;s to the King, that he would maintain the laws, in particular that concerning the Te&s;t. But with that they offered to pa&s;s a bill for indemnifying tho&s;e who had broken that law; and were ready to have con&s;idered them in the &s;upply that they intended to give.</P>
<P>The King expre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entments of this with much <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King was much offended with $word$.</NOTE> vehemence, when the addre&s;s was brought to him. He &s;aid, &s;ome men intended to di&s;turb the good corre&s;pondence that was between him and them, which would be a great preju|dice to the Nation: He had declared his mind &s;o po&s;itive|ly in that matter, that he hoped, they would not have med|led with it: Yet, he &s;aid, he would &s;till ob&s;erve all the pro|mi&s;es that he had made. This made &s;ome reflect on the vio|lations of the edict of <HI>Nantes</HI> by many of the late edicts that were &s;et out in <HI>France</HI> before the la&s;t that repealed it, in which the King of <HI>France</HI> had always declared, that he would maintain that edict, even when the breaches made
<PB N="667" REF="683">
upon it were the mo&s;t vi&s;ible and notorious. The Hou&s;e, upon this rough an&s;wer, was in a high fermentation. Yet, when one <HI>Cook</HI> &s;aid, that they were <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and were not to be threatned, becau&s;e this &s;eemed to be a want of re|&s;pect, they &s;ent him to the Tower; and obliged him to a&s;k pardon for tho&s;e indecent words. But they re&s;olved to in|&s;i&s;t on their addre&s;s, and then to proceed upon the petiti|ons concerning elections. And now tho&s;e, that dur&s;t not open their mouth before, &s;poke with much force upon this head. They &s;aid, it was a point upon which the Nation expected ju&s;tice, and they had a right to claim it. And it was probable, they would have condemned a great many elections: For an intimation was &s;et round, that all tho&s;e who had &s;tuck to the intere&s;t of the Nation, in the main points then before them, &s;hould be cho&s;en over again, tho' it &s;hould be found that their election was void, and that a new writ &s;hould go out. By this means tho&s;e petitions were now encouraged, and were like to have a fair hearing, and a ju&s;t deci&s;ion: And it was believed, that the abject Cour|tiers would have been voted out.</P>
<P>The King &s;aw, that both Hou&s;es were now &s;o fixed, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment was prorogued.</NOTE> he could carry nothing in either of them, unle&s;s he would depart from his &s;peech, and let the Act of the Te&s;t take place. So he prorogued the Parliament, and kept it by re|peated prorogations &s;till on foot for about a year and a half, but without holding a &s;e&s;&s;ion. All tho&s;e, who had either &s;poken or voted for the Te&s;t, were &s;oon after this di&s;graced, and turned out of their places, tho' many of the&s;e had &s;erv|ed the King hitherto with great ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s and much zeal. He called for many of them, and &s;poke to them very earne&s;tly upon that &s;ubject in his clo&s;et: Upon which the term of clo&s;eting was much to&s;&s;ed about. Many of the&s;e gave him very flat and hardy denials: Others, tho' more &s;ilent, yet were no le&s;s &s;teady. So that, when, after a long prac|tice both of threatning and ill u&s;age on the one hand, and of promi&s;es and corruption on the other, the King &s;aw he could not bring them into a compliance with him, he at la&s;t di&s;&s;olved the Parliament: By which he threw off a body of men that were in all other re&s;pects &s;ure to him, and that would have accepted a very moderate &s;atisfaction from him at any time. And indeed in all <HI>England</HI> it would not have been ea&s;y to have found five hundred men, &s;o weak, &s;o poor, and &s;o devoted to the Court, as the&s;e were. So happily was
<PB N="668" REF="684">
the Nation taken out of their hands, by the precipitated vio|lence of a bigotted Court.</P>
<P>Soon after the prorogation, the Lord <HI>de la Meer</HI> was <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord <HI>de la Meer</HI> tried, and acquitted.</NOTE> brought to his trial. Some witne&s;&s;es &s;wore high trea&s;on again&s;t him only upon report, that he had de&s;igned to make a rebellion in <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> and to join with the Duke of <HI>Mon|mouth.</HI> But, &s;ince tho&s;e &s;wore only upon hear-&s;ay, that was no evidence in law. One witne&s;s &s;wore home again&s;t him, and again&s;t two other Gentlemen, who, as he &s;aid, were in company with him; and that trea&s;onable me&s;&s;ages were then given to him by them all to carry to &s;ome others. That which gave the greate&s;t credit to the evidence was, that this Lord had gone from <HI>London</HI> &s;ecretly to <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> at the time of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s landing, and that after he had &s;taid a day or two in that Country, he had come up as &s;e|cretly to <HI>London.</HI> This looked &s;u&s;picious, and made it to be believed, that he went to try what could be done. The credit of that &s;ingle witne&s;s was overthrown by many un|que&s;tionable proofs, by which it appeared that the two Gen|tlemen, who he &s;aid met with that Lord in <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> were all that while &s;till in <HI>London.</HI> The witne&s;s, to gain the more credit, had brought others into the plot, by the com|mon fate of fal&s;e &s;wearers, who bring in &s;uch circum&s;tances to &s;upport their evidence, as they think will make it more credible, but, being ill laid, give a handle to tho&s;e concern|ed to find out their fal&s;hood. And that was the ca&s;e of this witne&s;s: For, tho' little doubt was made of the truth of that which he &s;wore again&s;t this Lord, as to the main of his evidence, yet he had added &s;uch a mixture of fal&s;hood to it, as being fully proved de&s;troyed the evidence. As for the &s;e|cret journey to and again between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> that Lord &s;aid, he had been long a pri&s;oner in the Tower upon bare &s;u&s;picion: He had no mind to be lodged again there: So he re&s;olved in that time of jealou&s;y to go out of the way: And hearing that a child, of which he was very fond, was &s;ick in <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> he went thither: And hearing from his Lady that his elde&s;t &s;on was very ill at <HI>London,</HI> he made ha&s;te back again. This was well proved by his phy&s;icians and dome&s;ticks, tho' it was a thing of very ill appearance, that he made &s;uch journies &s;o quick and &s;o &s;ecretly at &s;uch a time. The Solicitor General, <HI>Finch,</HI> pur&s;uant to the doc|trine he had maintained in former trials, and perhaps to atone for the zeal he had &s;hewed in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons for maintaining the Act of the Te&s;t, made a violent

declamation, to prove that one witne&s;s with pre&s;umptions was &s;ufficient to convict one of high trea&s;on. The Peers did unanimou&s;ly acquit the Lord. So that trial ended to the great joy of the whole Town; which was now turned to be as much again&s;t the Court, as it had been of late years for it. <HI>Finch</HI> had been continued in his employment only to lay the load of this judgment upon him: And he acted his part in it with his u&s;ual vehemence. He was pre|&s;ently after turned out. And <HI>Powis</HI> &s;ucceeded him, who was a compliant young a&s;piring Lawyer, tho' in him&s;elf he was no ill natured man. Now the po&s;ts in the law began to be again taken care of: For it was re&s;olved to act a piece of pageantry in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> with which the next year began.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Edward Hales,</HI> a Gentleman of a noble family in <HI>Kent,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1686 A trial upon the Act for the Te&s;t.</NOTE> declared him&s;elf a Papi&s;t, tho' he had long di&s;gui&s;ed it; and had once to my &s;elf &s;o &s;olemnly denied it, that I was led from thence to &s;ee, there was no credit to be given to that &s;ort of men, where their Church or religion was concerned. He had an employment: And not taking the Te&s;t his coach|man was &s;et up to inform again&s;t him, and to claim the 5.00 <HI>l.</HI> that the law gave to the informer. When this was to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Many Judges turn|ed out.</NOTE> be brought to trial, the Judges were &s;ecretly a&s;ked their opi|nions: And &s;uch as were not clear to judge as the Court did direct were turned out: And upon two or three canva&s;&s;ings the half of them were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and others of more plia|able and obedient under&s;tandings were put in their places. Some of the&s;e were weak and ignorant to a &s;candal. The &s;uit went on in a feeble pro&s;ecution: And in Trinity Term judgment was given.</P>
<P>There was a new Chief Ju&s;tice found out, very different <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Herbert,</HI> Chief ju&s;tice, gives Judg|ment for the King's di&s;|pen&s;ing power.</NOTE> indeed from <HI>Jefferies,</HI> Sir <HI>Edward Herbert.</HI> He was a well bred and a vertuous man, generous, and good natured. He was but an indifferent Lawyer; and had gone to <HI>Ireland</HI> to find practice and preferment there. He unhappily got into a &s;et of very high notions with relation to the King's prerogative. His gravity and vertues gave him great advan|tages, chiefly his &s;ucceeding &s;uch a mon&s;ter as had gone be|fore him. So he, being found to be a fit tool, was, with|out any application of his own, rai&s;ed up all at once to this high po&s;t. After the coachman's cau&s;e had been argued with a mo&s;t indecent coldne&s;s, by tho&s;e who were made u&s;e of on de&s;ign to expo&s;e and betray it, it was &s;aid, in favour of the prerogative, that the government of <HI>England</HI> was en|tirely
<PB N="670" REF="686">
in the King: That the Crown was an Imperial Crown, the importance of which was, that it was ab&s;olute: All penal laws were powers lodged in the Crown to enable the King to force the execution of the law, but were not bars to limit or bind up the King's power: The King could par|don all offences again&s;t the law, and forgive the penalties: And why could not he as well di&s;pen&s;e with them? Acts of Parliament had been oft &s;uper&s;eded: The Judges had &s;ome times given directions in their charges at Circuits to enquire after &s;ome Acts of Parliament no more: Of which one late in&s;tance happen'd during the former reign: An Act pa&s;&s;ed concerning the &s;ize of carts and waggons, with many penal|ties upon the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors: And yet, when it appeared that the model pre&s;cribed in the Act was not practicable, the Judges gave direction not to execute the Act.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the arguments brought to &s;upport the King's di&s;pen&s;ing power. In oppo&s;ition to this it was &s;aid, tho' not at the bar, yet in the common di&s;cour&s;e of the Town, that if penalties did ari&s;e only by vertue of the King's Pro|clamation, it was rea&s;onable that the power of di&s;pen&s;ing &s;hould be only in the King: But &s;ince the prerogative was both con&s;tituted and limited by law, and &s;ince penalties were impo&s;ed to force the ob&s;ervation of laws that were nece&s;&s;ary for the publick &s;afety, it was an overturning the whole government, and the changing it from a legal into a de&s;potick form, to &s;ay that laws, made and declared not to be capable of being di&s;pen&s;ed with, where one of the penalties was an incapacity, which by a maxim of law can|not be taken away even by a pardon, &s;hould at the plea&s;ure of the Prince be di&s;pen&s;ed with: A fine was al&s;o &s;et by the Act on offenders, but not given to the King, but to the informer, which thereby became his. So that the King could no more pardon that, than he could di&s;charge the debts of the &s;ubjects, and take away property: Laws of &s;mall con&s;equence, when a vi&s;ible error not ob&s;erved in making them was afterwards found out, like that of the &s;ize of carts, might well be &s;uper&s;eded: For the intention of the Legi&s;la|ture being the good of the &s;ubject, that is always to be pre|&s;umed for the repeal of an impracticable law. But it was not rea&s;onable to infer from thence, that a law made for the &s;ecurity of the government, with the mo&s;t effectual clau&s;es that could be contrived, on de&s;ign to force the execution of it, even in bar to the power of the prerogative, &s;hould be made &s;o precarious a thing, e&s;pecially when it was &s;o late|ly
<PB N="671" REF="687">
a&s;&s;erted with &s;o much vigour by the repre&s;entatives of the Nation. It was &s;aid, that, tho' this was now only applied to one &s;tatute, yet the &s;ame force of rea&s;on would hold to annul all our laws: And the penalty being that which is the life of the law, the di&s;pen&s;ing with penalties might &s;oon be carried &s;o far as to di&s;&s;olve the whole government: And the &s;ecurity that the &s;ubjects had were only from the laws, or rather from the penalties, &s;ince laws without the&s;e were feeble things, which tied men only according to their own di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Thus was this matter to&s;&s;ed about in the arguments, with which all peoples mouths were now filled. But Judges, who are beforehand determined how to give their opinions, will not be much moved even by the &s;tronge&s;t arguments. The ludicrous ones u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion at the bar were rather a farce, fitter for a mock trial in a play, than &s;uch as became men of learning in &s;o important a matter. Great expectations were rai&s;ed, to hear with what arguments the Judges would maintain the judgment that they &s;hould give. But they made nothing of it; and without any arguing gave judgment for the defendant, as if it had been in a cau&s;e of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Now the matter was as much &s;ettled, as a deci&s;ion in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Admiral <HI>Herbert</HI>'s firmne&s;s.</NOTE> King's Bench could &s;ettle it. Yet &s;o little regard had the Chief Ju&s;tice's neare&s;t friends to his opinion in this particu|lar, that his brother, Admiral <HI>Herbert,</HI> being pre&s;&s;ed by the King to promi&s;e that he would vote the repeal of the Te&s;t, an&s;wered the King very plainly, that he could not do it either in honour nor con&s;cience. The King &s;aid, he knew he was a man of honour, but the re&s;t of his life did not look like a man that had great regard to con&s;cience. He an&s;wered boldly, he had his faults, but they were &s;uch, that other people, who talked more of con&s;cience, were guil|ty of the like. He was indeed a man abandoned to luxury and vice. But, tho' he was poor, and had much to lo&s;e, having places to the value of 4000 <HI>l.</HI> a year, he cho&s;e to lo&s;e them all rather than comply. This made much noi&s;e: For as he had a great reputation for his conduct in &s;ea af|fairs, &s;o he had been mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately zealous in the King's &s;ervice from his fir&s;t &s;etting out to that day. It appeared by this, that no pa&s;t &s;ervices would be con&s;idered, if men were not re&s;olved to comply in every thing. The door was now opened. So all regard to the Te&s;t was laid a&s;ide. And all men that intended to recommend them&s;elves took em|ployments,
<PB N="672" REF="688">
and accepted of this di&s;pen&s;ing power. This was done even by &s;ome of tho&s;e who continued &s;till Pro|te&s;tants, tho' the far greater number of them continued to qualify them&s;elves according to law.</P>
<P>Many of the Papi&s;ts, that were men of quiet or of fear|ful <NOTE PLACE="marg">Father <HI>Peter</HI> a Je&s;uit in high favour.</NOTE> tempers, did not like the&s;e methods. They thought the Prie&s;ts went too fa&s;t, and the King was too eager in pur|&s;uing every thing that was &s;ugge&s;ted by them. One <HI>Peter,</HI> de&s;cended from a noble family, a man of no learning, nor any way famed for his vertue, but who made all up in bold|ne&s;s and zeal, was the <HI>Je&s;uit</HI> of them all that &s;eemed ani|mated with the mo&s;t courage. He had, during the Popi&s;h plot, been introduced to the King, and had &s;ugge&s;ted things, that &s;hewed him. a re&s;olute and undertaking man. Upon that the King looked on him as the fitte&s;t man to be &s;et at the head of his coun&s;els. So he was now con&s;idered, as the per|&s;on who of all others had the greate&s;t credit. He applied him&s;elf mo&s;t to the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> and was for &s;ome time chiefly directed by him.</P>
<P>The maxim that the King &s;et up, and about which he <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King declared for a toleration.</NOTE> entertained all that were about him, was, the great happine&s;s of an univer&s;al toleration. On this the King u&s;ed to enlarge in a great variety of topicks. He &s;aid, nothing was more rea&s;onable, more chri&s;tian, and more politick: And he re|flected much on the Church of <HI>England</HI> for the &s;everities with which Di&s;&s;enters had been treated. This, how true or ju&s;t &s;oever it might be, yet was &s;trange doctrine in the mouth of a profe&s;&s;ed Papi&s;t, and of a Prince on who&s;e ac|count, and by who&s;e direction, the Church party had been, indeed but too ob&s;equiou&s;ly, pu&s;hed on to that rigour. But, &s;ince the Church party could not be brought to comply with the de&s;ign of the Court, applications were now made to the Di&s;&s;enters: And all on a &s;udden the Churchmen were di&s;graced, and the Di&s;&s;enters were in high favour. Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Herbert</HI> went the We&s;tern Circuit after <HI>Jef|feries</HI>'s bloody one. And now all was grace and favour to them. Their former &s;ufferings were much reflected on, and pitied. Every thing was offered that could alleviate their &s;ufferings. Their teachers were now encouraged to &s;et up their Conventicles again, which had been di&s;continued, or held very &s;ecretly, for four or five years. Intimations were every where given, that the King would not have them, or their meetings, to be di&s;turbed. Some of them began to grow in&s;olent upon this &s;hew of favour. But wi&s;er men among them &s;aw thro'
<PB N="673" REF="689">
all this, and perceived the de&s;ign of the Papi&s;ts was now, to &s;et on the Di&s;&s;enters again&s;t the Church, as much as they had formerly &s;et the Church again&s;t them: And therefore, tho' they returned to their Conventicles, yet they had a ju&s;t jealou&s;y of the ill de&s;igns that lay hid under all this &s;udden and unexpected &s;hew of grace and kindne&s;s: And they took care not to provoke the Church party.</P>
<P>Many of the Clergy acted now a part that made good <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Clergy managed the points of controver&s;y with great zeal and &s;uc|ce&s;s.</NOTE> amends for pa&s;t errors. They began to preach generally again&s;t Popery, which the Di&s;&s;enters did not. They &s;et them&s;elves to &s;tudy the points of controver&s;y. And upon that there followed a great variety of &s;mall books, that were ea&s;ily purcha&s;ed and &s;oon read. They examined all the points of Popery with a &s;olidity of judgment, a clearne&s;s of argu|ing, a depth of learning, and a vivacity of writing, far be|yond any thing that had before that time appeared in our language. The truth is, they were very unequally yoked: For, if they are ju&s;tly to be reckoned among the be&s;t writers that have yet appeared on the Prote&s;tant &s;ide, tho&s;e they wrote again&s;t were certainly among the weake&s;t that had ever appeared on the Popi&s;h &s;ide. Their books were poor|ly but in&s;olently writ; and had no other learning in them, but what was taken out of &s;ome <HI>French</HI> writers, which they put into very bad <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> So that a victory over them need have been but a mean performance.</P>
<P>This had a mighty effect on the whole Nation: Even tho&s;e who could not &s;earch things to the bottom, yet were amazed at the great inequality that appeared in this engage|ment. The Papi&s;ts, who knew what &s;ervice the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux</HI>'s book had done in <HI>France,</HI> re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the &s;ame method here in &s;everal treati&s;es, which they entitled <HI>Papi&s;ts repre&s;ented and mi&s;repre&s;ented;</HI> to which &s;uch clear an&s;wers were writ, that what effect &s;oever that artifice might have, where it was &s;upported by the authority of a great King, and the terror of ill u&s;age, and a dragoonade in con|clu&s;ion, yet it &s;ucceeded &s;o ill in <HI>England,</HI> that it gave oc|ca&s;ion to enquire into the true opinions of that Church, not as &s;ome artful writers had di&s;gui&s;ed them, but as they were laid down in the books that are of authority among them, &s;uch as the deci&s;ions of Councils received among them, and their e&s;tabli&s;hed Offices, and as they are held at <HI>Rome,</HI> and in all tho&s;e countries where Popery prevails without any intermixture with hereticks, or apprehen&s;ion of them, as in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal.</HI> This was done in &s;o authentical
<PB N="674" REF="690">
a manner, that Popery it &s;elf was never &s;o well under&s;tood by the Nation, as it came to be upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons, who both managed and directed this contro|ver&s;ial war, were chiefly <HI>Tillot&s;on, Stillingfleet, Tenni&s;on,</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The per&s;ons who were chiefly en|gaged in this.</NOTE> <HI>Patrick.</HI> Next them were <HI>Sherlock, Williams, Claget, Gee, Aldrich, Atterbury, Whitby, Hooper,</HI> and above all the&s;e <HI>Wake,</HI> who having been long in <HI>France,</HI> Chaplain to the Lord <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> brought over with him many curious di&s;co|veries that were both u&s;eful and &s;urpri&s;ing. Be&s;ides the chief writers of tho&s;e books of controver&s;y, there were many &s;er|mons preached and printed on tho&s;e heads, that did very much edify the whole Nation. And this matter was managed with that concert, that for the mo&s;t part once a week &s;ome new book or &s;ermon came out, which both in&s;tructed and ani|mated tho&s;e who read them. There were but very few pro|&s;elytes gained to Popery: And the&s;e were &s;o incon&s;iderable, that they were rather a reproach than an honour to them. <HI>Walker,</HI> the head of <HI>Univer&s;ity</HI> College, and five or &s;ix more at <HI>Oxford,</HI> declared them&s;elves to be of that religion; but with this branch of infamy, that they had continued for &s;everal years complying with the doctrine and wor&s;hip of the Church of <HI>England</HI> after they were reconciled to the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> The Popi&s;h Prie&s;ts were enraged at this oppo&s;ition made by the Clergy, when they &s;aw their religi|on &s;o expo&s;ed, and them&s;elves &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed. They &s;aid, it was ill manners and want of duty to treat the King's religion with &s;o much contempt.</P>
<P>It was re&s;olved to proceed &s;everely again&s;t &s;ome of the preachers, and to try if by that means they might intimi|date <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>Sharp</HI> in trouble.</NOTE> the re&s;t. Dr. <HI>Sharp</HI> was the Rector of St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s, and was both a very pious man, and one of the mo&s;t popular preachers of the age, who had a peculiar talent of reading his &s;ermons with much life and zeal. He received one day, as he was coming out of the pulpit, a paper &s;ent him, as he believ|ed, by a Prie&s;t, containing a &s;ort of challenge upon &s;ome points of controver&s;y touched by him in &s;ome of his &s;er|mons. Upon this, he, not knowing to whom he &s;hould &s;end an an&s;wer, preached a &s;ermon in an&s;wer to it: And, af|ter he had confuted it, he concluded &s;hewing how unrea|&s;onable it was for Prote&s;tants to change their religion on &s;uch grounds. This was carried to Court, and repre&s;ented there, as a reflection on the King for changing on tho&s;e grounds.</P>
<P><PB N="675" REF="691">
The information, as to the words pretended to be &s;poken by <HI>Sharp,</HI> was fal&s;e, as he him&s;elf a&s;&s;ured me. But, without en|quiring <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> required to &s;u&s;pend him.</NOTE> into that, the Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI> &s;ent an order to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> in the King's name, requiring him to &s;u&s;pend <HI>Sharp</HI> immediately, and then to examine the mat|ter. The Bi&s;hop an&s;wered, that he had no power to pro|ceed in &s;uch a &s;ummary way: But, if an accu&s;ation were brought into his Court in a regular way, he would proceed to &s;uch a cen&s;ure as could be warranted by the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical law: Yet, he &s;aid, he would do that which was in his power, and &s;hould be upon the matter a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion; for he de&s;ired <HI>Sharp</HI> to ab&s;tain from officiating, till the matter &s;hould be better under&s;tood. But to lay &s;uch a cen&s;ure on a Clergy|man, as a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, without proof, in a judiciary proceed|ing, was contrary both to law and ju&s;tice. <HI>Sharp</HI> went to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Which he could not obey.</NOTE> Court to &s;hew the notes of his &s;ermon, which he was rea|dy to &s;wear were tho&s;e from which he had read it, by which the fal&s;hood of the information would appear. But, &s;ince he was not &s;u&s;pended, he was not admitted. Yet he was let alone. And it was re&s;olved to proceed again&s;t the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> for contempt.</P>
<P><HI>Jefferies</HI> was much &s;unk at Court, and <HI>Herbert</HI> was the mo&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Com|mi&s;&s;ion &s;et up.</NOTE> in favour. But now <HI>Jefferies,</HI> to recommend him&s;elf, offered a bold and illegal advice, for &s;etting up an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Commi&s;&s;ion, without calling it the High Commi&s;&s;ion, pretend|ing it was only a &s;tanding Court of Delegates. The Act that put down the High Commi&s;&s;ion in the year 1640 had provided by a clau&s;e, as full as could be conceived, that no Court &s;hould be ever &s;et up for tho&s;e matters, be&s;ides the ordinary Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Courts. Yet in contempt of that a Court was erected, with full power to proceed in a &s;ummary and arbitrary way in all Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical matters, without limitations to any rule of law in their proceedings. This &s;tretch of the &s;upremacy, &s;o contrary to law, was a&s;&s;umed by a King, who&s;e religion made him con|demn all that &s;upremacy that the law had ve&s;ted in the Crown.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons with whom this power was lodged were the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Dure&s;ine</HI> and <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Trea&s;urer, and Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, the Lord Chancellor being made Pre&s;ident in the Court <HI>&s;ine quo non;</HI> for they would tru&s;t this to no other management. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> was mark|ed out to be the fir&s;t &s;acrifice. <HI>Sancroft</HI> lay &s;ilent at <HI>Lam|beth.</HI> He &s;eemed zealous again&s;t Popery in private di&s;cour&s;e: But he was of &s;uch a timorous temper, and &s;o &s;et on the en|riching
<PB N="676" REF="692">
his nephew, that he &s;hewed no &s;ort of courage. He would not go to this Court, when it was fir&s;t opened, and declare again&s;t it, and give his rea&s;ons why he could not &s;it and act in it, judging it to be again&s;t law: But he con|tented him&s;elf with his not going to it. The other two Bi|&s;hops were more compliant. <HI>Dure&s;me</HI> was lifted up with it, and &s;aid, now his name would be recorded in hi&s;tory: And, when &s;ome of his friends repre&s;ented to him the danger of acting in a Court &s;o illegally con&s;tituted, he &s;aid, he could not live if he &s;hould lo&s;e the King's gracious &s;miles: So low, and &s;o fawning was he. <HI>Dolben,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> died this year. So, as <HI>Sprat</HI> had &s;ucceeded him in <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> he had &s;ome hopes let fall of &s;ucceeding likewi&s;e in <HI>York.</HI> But the Court had laid it down for a maxim to keep all the great Sees, that &s;hould become vacant, &s;till empty, till they might fill them to their own mind: So he was mi&s;taken in his expecta|tions, if he ever had them.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> was the fir&s;t per&s;on, that was &s;um|moned <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> brought be|fore it.</NOTE> to appear before this new Court. He was attended on by many per&s;ons of great Quality, which gave a new of|fence: And the Lord Chancellor treated him in that brutal way, that was now become as it were natural to him. The Bi&s;hop &s;aid, here was a new Court of which he knew no|thing: So he de&s;ired a copy of the commi&s;&s;ion that autho|ri&s;ed them. And, after he had drawn out the matters by delays for &s;ome time, hoping that the King might ac|cept of &s;ome general and re&s;pectful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and &s;o let the matter fall, at la&s;t he came to make his defence, all &s;e|cret methods to divert the &s;torm proving ineffectual. The fir&s;t part of it was an exception to the authority of the Court, as being not only founded on no law, but contrary to the expre&s;s words of the Act of Parliament that put down the High Commi&s;&s;ion. Yet this point was rather in&s;inuated, than urged with the force that might have been u&s;ed: For it was &s;aid, that, if the Bi&s;hop &s;hould in&s;i&s;t too much on that, it would draw a much heavier mea&s;ure of indignation on him; therefore it was rather opened, and mode&s;tly re|pre&s;ented to the Court, than &s;trongly argued. But it may be ea&s;ily believed, that tho&s;e who &s;ate by virtue of this ille|gal Commi&s;&s;ion would maintain their own authority. The other part of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI>'s plea was, that he had obeyed the King's orders, as far as he legally could do; for he had obliged Dr. <HI>Sharp</HI> to act as a man that was &s;u&s;pended; but that he could not lay an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ure
<PB N="677" REF="693">
on any of his Clergy without a proce&s;s, and articles, and &s;ome proof brought. This was ju&s;tified by the con&s;tant practice of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts, and by the judgment of all law|yers. But arguments, how &s;trong &s;oever, are feeble things, when a &s;entence is re&s;olved on before the cau&s;e is heard. So it was propo&s;ed, that he &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended during the King's plea&s;ure. The Lord Chancellor and the poor-&s;pi|rited Bi&s;hop of <HI>Dure&s;me</HI> were for this: But the Earl, and Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Herbert,</HI> were for acquitting him. There was not &s;o much as a co|lour of law to &s;upport the &s;entence: So none could be given.</P>
<P>But the King was re&s;olved to carry this point, and &s;poke <NOTE PLACE="marg">And was &s;u&s;pended by it.</NOTE> roundly about it to the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter.</HI> He &s;aw he mu&s;t either concur in the &s;entence, or part with the White Staff. So he yielded. And the Bi&s;hop was &s;u&s;pended <HI>ab officio.</HI> They did not think fit to meddle with his revenues. For the law|yers had &s;ettled that point, that benefices were of the na|ture of freeholds. So, if the &s;entence had gone to the tem|poralties, the Bi&s;hop would have had the matter tried over again in the King's Bench, where he was like to find good ju&s;tice, <HI>Herbert</HI> not being &s;atisfied with the legality and ju&s;tice of the &s;entence. While this matter was in dependance, the Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange</HI> thought it became her to interpo&s;e a lit|tle in the Bi&s;hop's favour. He had confirmed, and married her. So &s;he wrote to the King, earne&s;tly begging him to be gentle to the Bi&s;hop, who &s;he could not think would offend willingly. She al&s;o wrote to the Bi&s;hop, expre&s;&s;ing the great &s;hare &s;he took in the trouble he was fallen into. The Prince wrote to him to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. The King wrote an an&s;wer to the Prince&s;s, reflecting &s;everely on the Bi&s;hop, not without &s;ome &s;harpne&s;s on her for meddling in &s;uch matters. Yet the Court &s;eemed unea&s;y, when they &s;aw they had gained &s;o poor a victory: For now the Bi&s;hop was more con&s;idered than ever. His Clergy, for all the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, were really more governed by the &s;ecret intimations of his plea&s;ure, than they had been by his authority before. So they re&s;olved to come off as well as they could. Dr. <HI>Sharp</HI> was admitted to offer a general petition, importing how &s;orry he was to find him&s;elf under the King's di&s;plea&s;ure: Upon which he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a gentle reprimand, and &s;uffered to return to the exerci&s;e of his function. Accord|ing to the form of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts, a per&s;on under &s;uch a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion mu&s;t make a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion within &s;ix months:
<PB N="678" REF="694">
Otherwi&s;e he may be proceeded again&s;t as ob&s;tinate. So, &s;ix months after the &s;entence, the Bi&s;hop &s;ent a petition to the King, de&s;iring to be re&s;tored to the exerci&s;e of his Epi&s;co|pal function. But he made no acknowledgment of any fault. So this had no other effect, but that it &s;topt all fur|ther proceedings: Only the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion lay &s;till on him. I have laid all this matter together, tho' the progre&s;s of it ran into the year eighty &s;even.</P>
<P>Affairs in <HI>Scotland</HI> went on much at the &s;ame rate as they <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> did in <HI>England.</HI> Some few pro&s;elytes were gained. But as they were very few, &s;o they could do little &s;ervice to the &s;ide to which they joined them&s;elves. The Earl of <HI>Perth</HI> prevailed with his Lady, as &s;he was dying, to change her religion. And in a very few weeks after her death he married very indecently a &s;i&s;ter of the Duke of <HI>Gordon</HI>'s. They were fir&s;t cou&s;ins: And yet without &s;taying for a di&s;|pen&s;ation from <HI>Rome</HI> they ventured on a marriage, upon the a&s;&s;urances that they &s;aid their Confe&s;&s;or gave them that it would be ea&s;ily obtained. But Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> was &s;tiff man, and did not grant tho&s;e things ea&s;ily: So that Cardinal <HI>Howard</HI> could not at fir&s;t obtain it. The Pope &s;aid, the&s;e were &s;trange converts, that would venture on &s;uch a thing without fir&s;t obtaining a di&s;pen&s;ation. The Cardinal pre|tended, that new converts did not &s;o &s;oon under&s;tand the laws of the Church: But he laid before the Pope the ill con|&s;equences of offending converts of &s;uch importance. So he prevailed at la&s;t, not without great difficulty. The Earl of <HI>Perth</HI> &s;et up a private Chapel in the Court for Ma&s;s, which was not kept &s;o private, but that many frequent|ed it.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Edenburgh</HI> was much alarmed at this. And <NOTE PLACE="marg">A tumult at <HI>Edenburgh.</HI></NOTE> the rabble broke in with &s;uch fury, that they defaced every thing in the Chapel. And if the Earl of <HI>Perth</HI> had not been conveyed away in di&s;gui&s;e, he had very probably fallen a &s;acrifice to popular rage. The guards upon the alarm came, and di&s;per&s;ed the rabble. Some were taken: And one that was a ringleader in the tumult was executed for it. When he was at the place of execution, he told one of the Mini&s;|ters of the Town, that was with him a&s;&s;i&s;ting him with his prayers, that he was offered his life, if he would accu&s;e the Duke of <HI>Queensborough,</HI> as the per&s;on that had &s;et on the tumult, but he would not &s;ave his life by &s;o fal&s;e a calumny. Mr. <HI>Macom,</HI> the Mini&s;ter, was an hone&s;t but weak man. So, when the criminal charged him to make this di&s;covery, he
<PB N="679" REF="695">
did not call any of tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent to bear witne&s;s of it: But in the &s;implicity of his heart he went from the execution to the Archbi&s;hop of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> and told him what had pa&s;t. The Archbi&s;hop acquainted the Duke of <HI>Queensborough</HI> with it. And he writ to Court, and com|plained of it. The King ordered the matter to be ex|amined. So the poor Mini&s;ter, having no witne&s;s to atte&s;t what the criminal had &s;aid to him, was declared the forger of that calumny. And upon that he was turned out. But how &s;everely &s;oever tho&s;e in authority may handle a poor incautious man, yet the publick is apt to judge true. And, in this ca&s;e, as the Mini&s;ter's weakne&s;s and misfortune was pitied, &s;o the Earl of <HI>Perth</HI>'s malice and treachery was as much dete&s;ted.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer this year, the Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> another new <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment held there.</NOTE> convert, was &s;ent the King's Commi&s;&s;ioner to hold a Parlia|ment in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to try if it would be more compliant than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parliament had been. The King did by his letter recommend to them in very earne&s;t words the taking off all penal laws and te&s;ts relating to religion. And all po&s;&s;ible methods were u&s;ed to prevail on a majority. But two accidents happen'd before the opening the Par|liament; which made great impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of many.</P>
<P><HI>Whitford,</HI> &s;on to one of their Bi&s;hops before the wars, had turned a Papi&s;t. He was the per&s;on that killed <HI>Dari&s;laus</HI> in <HI>Holland.</HI> And, that he might get out of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s reach, he had gone into the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s &s;ervice; and was there when the la&s;t ma&s;&s;acre was committed on the <HI>Vau|dois.</HI> He had committed many barbarous murders with his own hands, and had a &s;mall pen&s;ion given him after the Re&s;toration. He died a few days before the Parliament met; and called for &s;ome Mini&s;ters, and to them declared his for&s;aking of Popery, and his abhorrence of it for its cru|elty. He &s;aid, he had been guilty of &s;ome execrable mur|ders in <HI>Piedmont,</HI> both of women and children, which had pur&s;ued him with an intolerable horror of mind ever after that. He had gone to Prie&s;ts of all &s;orts, the &s;tricte&s;t as well as the ea&s;ie&s;t: And they had ju&s;tified him in what he had done, and had given him ab&s;olution. But his con&s;cience pur&s;ued him &s;o, that he died as in de&s;pair, crying out again&s;t that bloody religion.</P>
<P>The other was more &s;olemn. Sir <HI>Robert Sibbald,</HI> a Doctor of phy&s;ick, and the mo&s;t learned antiquary in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who
<PB N="680" REF="696">
had lived in a cour&s;e of philo&s;ophical vertue, but in great doubts as to revealed religion, was prevailed on by the Earl of <HI>Perth</HI> to turn Papi&s;t, in hopes to find that certainty among them, which he could not arrive at upon his own principles. But he had no &s;ooner done this, than he be|gan to be a&s;hamed that he had made &s;uch a &s;tep upon &s;o little enquiry. So he went to <HI>London,</HI> and retired for &s;ome months from all company, and went into a deep cour&s;e of &s;tudy, by which he came to &s;ee into the errors of Popery, with &s;o full a conviction that he came down to <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;ome weeks before the Parliament, and could not be at quiet till he had publi&s;hed his recantation openly in a Church. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Edenburgh</HI> was &s;o much a Courtier, that, ap|prehending many might go to hear it, and that it might give offence at Court, he &s;ent him to do it in a Church in the Country. But the recantation of &s;o learned a man, upon &s;o much &s;tudy, had a great effect upon many.</P>
<P><HI>Ro&s;&s;e</HI> and <HI>Pater&s;on,</HI> the two governing Bi&s;hops, re&s;olved to let the King &s;ee how compliant they would be. And they procured an addre&s;s to be &s;igned by &s;everal of their Bench, offering to concur with the King in all that he de|&s;ired with relation to tho&s;e of his own religion, (for the courtly &s;tile now was not to name Popery any other way than by calling it the King's religion,) providing the laws might &s;till continue in force and be executed again&s;t the Pre&s;byterians. With this <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> was &s;ent up. He commu|nicated the matter to the Earl of <HI>Middleton,</HI> who advi&s;ed him never to &s;hew that paper: It would be made u&s;e of again&s;t them, and render them odious: And the King and all his Prie&s;ts were &s;o &s;en&s;ible that it was an indecent thing for them to pretend to any &s;pecial favour, that they were re&s;olved to move for nothing but a general toleration. And &s;o he per&s;uaded him to go back without pre&s;enting it. This was told me by one who had it from the Earl him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When the &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament was opened, Duke <HI>Hamil|ton</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Which re|fu&s;ed to comply with the King's de&s;ires.</NOTE> was &s;ilent in the debate. He promi&s;ed, he would not op|po&s;e the motion: But he would not be active to promote it. The Duke of <HI>Queensborough</HI> was al&s;o &s;ilent: But the King was made believe that he managed the oppo&s;ition under hand. <HI>Ro&s;&s;e</HI> and <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> did &s;o entirely forget what be|came their characters, that they u&s;ed their utmo&s;t endea|vours to per&s;uade the Parliament to comply with the King's de&s;ire. The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> oppo&s;ed it, but fear|fully.
<PB N="681" REF="697">
The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Dunkeld, Bruce,</HI> did it openly and re&s;olutely: And &s;o did the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Galloway.</HI> The re&s;t were &s;ilent, but were re&s;olved to vote for the continuance of the laws. Such was the meanne&s;s of mo&s;t of the Nobility, and of the other members, that few did hope that a re&s;i&s;|tance to the Court could be maintained. Yet the Parliament would con&s;ent to nothing, further than to a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of tho&s;e laws during the King's life. The King de&s;pi&s;ed this. So the &s;e&s;&s;ion was put off, and the Parliament was quickly di&s;&s;olved. And, &s;oon after that, both the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Gla&s;|gow</HI> and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Dunkeld</HI> were turned out by an expre&s;s command from the King. And <HI>Pater&s;on</HI> was made Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Gla&s;gow.</HI> And one <HI>Hamilton,</HI> noted for pro|fanene&s;s and impiety, that &s;ometimes broke out into bla&s;|phemy, was made Bi&s;hop of <HI>Dunkeld.</HI> No rea&s;on was a&s;|&s;igned for turning out tho&s;e Bi&s;hops, but the King's plea|&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Nation, which was become very corrupt, and both <NOTE PLACE="marg">A zeal ap|peared there again&s;t Popery.</NOTE> ignorant and in&s;en&s;ible in the matters of religion, began now to return to its old zeal again&s;t Popery. Few pro&s;e|lytes were made after this. The Epi&s;copal Clergy were in many places &s;o &s;unk into &s;loth and ignorance, that they were not capable of conducting this zeal. Some of them about <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> and in divers other places, began to mind tho&s;e matters, and recovered &s;ome degrees of credit by the oppo&s;ition they made to Popery. But the Pre&s;byterians, tho' they were now freed from the great &s;everities they had long &s;marted under, yet expre&s;&s;ed on all occa&s;ions their uncon|querable aver&s;ion to Popery. So the Court was &s;oon con|vinced, that they were not to be depended on.</P>
<P>But, what oppo&s;ition &s;oever the King met with in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs in <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> i&s;le of <HI>Britain,</HI> things went on more to his mind in <HI>Ire|land.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> upon his fir&s;t coming over gave publick and po&s;itive a&s;&s;urances, that the King would maintain their Act of Settlement. This he did very often, and very &s;olemnly; and proceeded accordingly. In the mean while the Earl of <HI>Tirconnel</HI> went on more roundly. He not only put <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Papi&s;ts in &s;uch po&s;ts in the Army as became void, but upon the &s;lighte&s;t pretences he broke the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tant officers to make room for the others: And in conclu&s;ion, without &s;o much as pretending a colour for it, he turned them all out. And now an Army, paid by vertue of the Act of Settlement to &s;ecure it, was wre&s;ted out of legal hands, and put in the hands of tho&s;e who were
<PB N="682" REF="698">
engaged both in religion and intere&s;t to de&s;troy the Settle|ment, and tho&s;e concerned in it; which was too gro&s;s a violation of law to be in any &s;ort palliated. So the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tants of <HI>Ireland</HI> looked on them&s;elves as at mercy, &s;ince the Army was now made up of their enemies. And all that the Lord Lieutenant, or the Lord Chancellor, could &s;ay did not quiet their fears: Good words could not give &s;ecu|rity again&s;t &s;uch deeds as they &s;aw every day. Upon this the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Tirconnell</HI> fell into per|petual jarrings, and were making &s;uch complaints one of another, that the King re&s;olved to put an end to tho&s;e di&s;|orders by recalling both the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> and <HI>Porter.</HI> He made the Earl of <HI>Tirconnell</HI> Lord Lieutenant, and <HI>Fitton</HI> Lord Chancellor, who were both not only profe&s;&s;ed but zealous Papi&s;ts. <HI>Fitton</HI> knew no other law but the King's plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>This &s;truck all people there with great terror, when a man of <HI>Tirconnell</HI>'s temper, &s;o entirely tru&s;ted and depended on by the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> capable of the bolde&s;t undertakings, and of the cruele&s;t execution, had now the government put &s;o en|tirely in his hands. The Papi&s;ts of <HI>England</HI> either di&s;&s;em|bled very artificiou&s;ly, or they were much troubled at this, which gave &s;o great an alarm every where. It was vi&s;ible, that Father <HI>Peter</HI> and the Je&s;uits were re&s;olved to engage the King &s;o far, that matters &s;hould be put pa&s;t all retreat|ing and compounding; that &s;o the King might think no more of governing by Parliament, but by a military force; and, if that &s;hould not &s;tick firm to him, by a&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>France,</HI> and by an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army.</P>
<P>An accident happen'd at this time, that gave the Queen great offence, and put the Prie&s;ts much out of countenance. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King made his mi&s;tre&s;s Counte&s;s of <HI>Dorche&s;ter.</HI></NOTE> The King continued to go &s;till to Mrs. <HI>Sidley.</HI> And &s;he gained &s;o much on him, that at la&s;t &s;he prevailed to be made Counte&s;s of <HI>Dorche&s;ter.</HI> As &s;oon as the Queen heard of this, &s;he gave order to bring all the Prie&s;ts, that were ad|mitted to a particular confidence, into her clo&s;et. And, when &s;he had them about her, &s;he &s;ent to de&s;ire the King to come and &s;peak to her. When he came, he was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;uch a company about her, but much more when they fell all on their knees before him. And the Queen broke out into a bitter mourning for this new honour, which they expected would be followed with the &s;etting her up openly as mi&s;tre&s;s. The Queen was then in an ill habit of body; and had an illne&s;s that, as was thought, would end in a con|&s;umption.
<PB N="683" REF="699">
And it was believed that her &s;ickne&s;s was of &s;uch a nature, that it gave a very melancholy pre&s;age, that, if &s;he &s;hould live, &s;he could have no children. The Prie&s;ts &s;aid to the King, that a blemi&s;h in his life bla&s;ted their de|&s;igns: And the more it appeared, and the longer it was con|tinued, the more ineffectual all their endeavours would prove. The King was much moved with this, and was out of coun|tenance for what he had done. But, to quiet them all, he promi&s;ed them, that he would &s;ee the Lady no more; and pretended, that he gave her this title in order to the break|ing with her the more decently. And, when the Queen did not &s;eem to believe this, he promi&s;ed that he would &s;end her to <HI>Ireland,</HI> which was done accordingly. But, after a &s;tay there for &s;ome months, &s;he came over again: And that ill commerce was &s;till continued. The Prie&s;ts were no doubt the more apprehen&s;ive of this, becau&s;e &s;he was bold and lively, and was always treating them and their proceedings with great contempt.</P>
<P>The Court was now much &s;et on making of converts; which failed in mo&s;t in&s;tances, and produced repartees, that, whether true or fal&s;e, were much repeated, and were heard with great &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Mulgrave</HI> was Lord Chamberlain. He was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempts made on many to change their religion.</NOTE> apt to comply in every thing that he thought might be ac|ceptable; for he went with the King to Ma&s;s, and kneeled at it. And, being looked on as indifferent to all religions, the Prie&s;ts made an attack on him. He heard them gravely arguing for tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. He told them, he was wil|ling to receive in&s;truction: He had taken much pains to bring him&s;elf to believe in God, who made the world and all men in it: But it mu&s;t not be an ordinary force of argument, that could make him believe, that man was quite with God, and made God again.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Middleton</HI> had married into a Popi&s;h family, and was a man of great parts and a generous temper, but of loo&s;e principles in religion. So a Prie&s;t was &s;ent to in&s;truct him. He began with tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, of which he &s;aid he would convince him immediately: And began thus, You be|lieve the Trinity. <HI>Middleton</HI> &s;topt him, and &s;aid, Who told you &s;o? At which he &s;eemed amazed. So the Earl &s;aid, he expected he &s;hould convince him of his belief, but not que&s;tion him of his own. With this the Prie&s;t was &s;o di&s;|ordered, that he could proceed no further. One day the King gave the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> the &s;word of State to carry
<PB N="684" REF="700">
before him to the Chapel: And he &s;tood at the door. Up|on which the King &s;aid to him, My Lord, your father would have gone further: To which the Duke an&s;wered, Your Ma|je&s;ty's father was the better man, and he would not have gone &s;o far. <HI>Kirk</HI> was al&s;o &s;poken to, to change his religi|on; and replied bri&s;kly, that he was already pre-engaged, for he had promi&s;ed the King of <HI>Morocco,</HI> that, if ever he changed his religion, he would turn Mahometan.</P>
<P>But the per&s;on that was the mo&s;t con&s;idered, was the Earl <NOTE PLACE="marg">Particularly on the Earl of <HI>Roche&s;ter.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Roche&s;ter.</HI> He told me, that upon the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s defeat the King did &s;o immediately turn to other mea&s;ures, that, tho' before that the King talked to him of all his af|fairs with great freedom, and commonly every morning of the bu&s;ine&s;s that was to be done that day, yet the very day after his execution the King changed his method, and never talked more to him of any bu&s;ine&s;s, but what concerned the Trea&s;ury: So that, he &s;aw, he had now no more the root he formerly had. He was looked on, as &s;o much united to the Clergy, that the Papi&s;ts were all &s;et again&s;t him. He had, in a want of money, procured a con&s;iderable loan, by which he was kept in his po&s;t longer than was intend|ed. At la&s;t, as he related the matter to me, the King &s;poke to him, and de&s;ired he would &s;uffer him&s;elf to be in|&s;tructed in religion. He an&s;wered, he was fully &s;atisfied about his religion. But upon the King's pre&s;&s;ing it, that he would hear his Prie&s;ts, he &s;aid, he de&s;ired then to have &s;ome of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Clergy pre&s;ent, to which the King con&s;ented: Only he excepted to <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Stilling fleet.</HI> Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> &s;aid, he would take tho&s;e who &s;hould happen to be in waiting; for the forms of the Chapel were &s;till kept up. And Doctor <HI>Patrick</HI> and <HI>Jane</HI> were the men. Upon this a day was &s;et for the conference.</P>
<P>But his enemies had another &s;tory. He had notice given him, that he would &s;hortly lo&s;e the White Staff: Upon which his Lady, who was then &s;ick, wrote to the Queen, and begged &s;he would honour her &s;o far as to come, and let her have &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e with her. The Queen came, and &s;taid above two hours with her. She complained of the ill of|fices that were done them. The Queen &s;aid, all the Pro|te&s;tants were now turning again&s;t them, &s;o that they knew not how they could tru&s;t any of them. Upon which that Lady &s;aid, her Lord was not &s;o wedded to any opinion, as not to be ready to be better in&s;tructed. And it was &s;aid, that this gave the ri&s;e to the King's propo&s;ing a conference: For
<PB N="685" REF="701">
it has been ob&s;erved to be a common method of making pro|&s;elytes with the more pomp, to propo&s;e a conference: But this was generally done, after they were well a&s;&s;ured, that, let the conference go which way it might, the per&s;on's de|ci&s;ion for whom it was appointed &s;hould be on their &s;ide. The Earl denied, he knew any thing of all this to me: And his Lady died not long after. It was further &s;aid by his ene|mies, that the day before the conference he had an adver|ti&s;ement from a &s;ure hand, that nothing he could do would maintain him in his po&s;t, and that the King had engaged him&s;elf to put the Trea&s;ury in commi&s;&s;ion, and to bring &s;ome of the Popi&s;h Lords into it. <HI>Patrick</HI> told me, that at the conference there was no occa&s;ion for them to &s;ay much.</P>
<P>The Prie&s;ts began the attack. And, when they had done, the Earl &s;aid, if they had nothing &s;tronger to urge, he would not trouble tho&s;e learned Gentlemen to &s;ay any thing: For he was &s;ure he could an&s;wer all that he had heard. And &s;o an&s;wered it all with much heat and &s;pirit, not without &s;ome &s;corn, &s;aying, were the&s;e grounds to per&s;uade men to change their religion? This he urged over and over again with great vehemence. The King, &s;eeing in what temper he was, broke off the conference, charging all that were pre&s;ent to &s;ay nothing of it.</P>
<P>Soon after that he lo&s;t his White Staff; but had a pen&s;ion <NOTE PLACE="marg">He was turned out.</NOTE> of 4000 <HI>l.</HI> a year for his own life and his &s;on's, be&s;ides his grant upon the Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> and another valued at 20000 <HI>l.</HI> So here were great regards had to him: No place having ever been &s;old, even by a per&s;on in favour, to &s;uch advan|tage. The &s;um that he had procured to be lent the King being 400000 <HI>l,</HI> and it being all ordered to go towards the repair of the Fleet, this began to be much talked of. The &s;tores were very ill furni&s;hed: And the ve&s;&s;els them&s;elves were in decay. But now orders were given, with great di&s;patch to put the whole Fleet in condition to go to &s;ea, tho' the King was then in full peace with all his neighbours. Such prepa|rations &s;eemed to be made upon &s;ome great de&s;ign.</P>
<P>The Prie&s;ts &s;aid every where, but chiefly at <HI>Rome,</HI> that <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;igns talked of again&s;t <HI>Hol|land.</HI></NOTE> the de&s;ign was again&s;t the States; and that both <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> would make war on them all of the &s;udden; for it was generally known that the <HI>Dutch</HI> fleet was in no good condition. The intere&s;ts of <HI>France</HI> and of the Prie&s;ts made this to be the more ea&s;ily believed. The embroiling the King with the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was that which the <HI>French</HI> de&s;ired above all other things, hoping that &s;uch a war, being
<PB N="686" REF="702">
&s;ucce&s;sful, might put the King on excluding the Prince from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Crown in the right of his wife, which was the thing that both the <HI>French</HI> and the Prie&s;ts de&s;ired mo&s;t: For they &s;aw that, unle&s;s the Queen had a &s;on, all their de&s;igns mu&s;t &s;tand &s;till at pre&s;ent, and turn abortive in con|clu&s;ion, as long as the Nation had &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;or in view.</P>
<P>This carries me now to open the &s;tate of affairs in <HI>Hol|land,</HI> and at the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Court. I mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;ay &s;ome|what of my &s;elf: For this &s;ummer, after I had rambled above a year, I came into <HI>Holland.</HI> I &s;taid three or four months in <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Switzerland,</HI> after I came out of <HI>Italy.</HI> I &s;taid <NOTE PLACE="marg">I &s;taid &s;ome time in <HI>Geneva.</HI></NOTE> al&s;o &s;ome time among the <HI>Lutherans</HI> at <HI>Strasbourg</HI> and <HI>Franc|fort,</HI> and among the <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> at <HI>Heidleberg,</HI> be&s;ides the fur|ther opportunities I had to know their way in <HI>Holland.</HI> I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to ob&s;erve all their methods, and to know all the eminent men among them. I &s;aw the Churches of <HI>France</HI> in their be&s;t &s;tate, while they were every day look|ing when this dreadful &s;torm &s;hould break out, which has &s;cattered them up and down the world. I was all the win|ter at <HI>Geneva,</HI> where we had con&s;tantly fre&s;h &s;tories brought us of the mi&s;eries of tho&s;e who were &s;uffering in <HI>France.</HI> Re|fugees were coming over every day poor, and naked, and half &s;tarved before they got thither. And that &s;mall State was under great apprehen&s;ions of being &s;wallowed up, hav|ing no &s;trength of their own, and being ju&s;tly afraid that tho&s;e at <HI>Bern</HI> would grow weary of defending them, if they &s;hould be vigorou&s;ly attacked. The re&s;t of <HI>Switzerland</HI> was not in &s;uch imminent danger. But, as they were full of Refu|gees, and all &s;ermons and di&s;cour&s;es were much upon the per&s;ecution in <HI>France,</HI> &s;o <HI>Ba&s;ile</HI> was expo&s;ed in &s;uch manner, that the <HI>French</HI> could po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of it when they plea&s;|ed, without the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance. Tho&s;e of <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> as they have already lo&s;t their liberty, &s;o they were every day look|ing for &s;ome fatal edict, like that which the <HI>French</HI> had fal|len under. The Churches of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> as they are now the frontier of the Empire, expo&s;ed to be de&s;troyed by every new war, &s;o they are fallen into the hands of a bi|gotted family. All the other Churches on the <HI>Rhine</HI> &s;ee how near they are to ruine. And as the United Provinces were a few years before this very near being &s;wallowed up, &s;o they were now well a&s;&s;ured that two great Kings de&s;igned to ruin them.</P>
<P><PB N="687" REF="703">
Under &s;o cloudy a pro&s;pect it &s;hould be expected, that a &s;pirit of true devotion and of a real reformation &s;hould ap|pear more, both among the Clergy and Laity; that they <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;tate and temper I ob&s;erved a|mong the Reformed&punc;</NOTE> &s;hould all apprehend that God was highly offended with them, and was therefore puni&s;hing &s;ome, and threatning others, in a mo&s;t unu&s;ual manner. It might have been expected, that tho&s;e unhappy conte&s;ts between <HI>Lutherans</HI> and <HI>Calvini&s;ts, Ar|minians</HI> and <HI>Anti-Arminians,</HI> with &s;ome minuter di&s;putes that have enflamed <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Switzerland,</HI> &s;hould have been at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pended while they had a common enemy to deal with, again&s;t whom their whole force united was &s;carce able to &s;tand. But the&s;e things were carried on rather with more eagerne&s;s and &s;harpne&s;s than ever. It is true, there has ap|peared much of a primitive charity towards the <HI>French</HI> Re|fugees: They have been in all places well received, kindly treated, and bountifully &s;upplied. Yet even among them there did not appear a &s;pirit of piety and devotion &s;uitable to their condition: Tho' per&s;ons who have willingly &s;uffered the lo&s;s of all things, and have for&s;aken their country, their hou&s;es, e&s;tates, and their friends, and &s;ome of them their neare&s;t relations, rather than &s;in again&s;t their con&s;ciences, mu&s;t be believed to have a deeper principle in them, than can well be ob&s;erved by others.</P>
<P>I was indeed amazed at the labours and learning of the Mini&s;ters among the Reformed. They under&s;tood the Scrip|tures well in the original tongues: They had all the points of controver&s;y very ready, and did thoroughly under&s;tand the whole body of divinity. In many places they preached every day, and were almo&s;t con&s;tantly employed in vi&s;iting their flock. But they performed their devotions but &s;lightly, and read their prayers, which were too long, with great preci|pitation and little zeal. Their &s;ermons were too long and too dry. And they were &s;o &s;trict, even to jealou&s;y, in the &s;malle&s;t points in which they put orthodoxy, that one who could not go into all their notions, but was re&s;olved not to quar|rel with them, could not conver&s;e much with them with any freedom. I have, upon all the ob&s;ervation that I have made, often con&s;idered the inward &s;tate of the Reformation, and the decay of the vitals of Chri&s;tianity in it, as that which gives more melancholy impre&s;&s;ions, than all the outward dangers that &s;urround it.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> things were much changed, with relation to the Court, in the compa&s;s of a year. The terror all peo|ple were under from an ill cho&s;en and an ill con&s;tituted
<PB N="688" REF="704">
Parliament was now almo&s;t over: And the Clergy were come to their wits, and were beginning to recover their reputa|tion. The Nation was like to prove much firmer than could have been expected, e&s;pecially in &s;o &s;hort a time. Yet after all, tho' many were like to prove them&s;elves better Prote&s;|tants than was looked for, they were not become much bet|ter Chri&s;tians: And few were turning to a &s;tricter cour&s;e of life: Nor were the Clergy more diligent in their labours among their people, in which re&s;pect it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Clergy are the mo&s;t remi&s;s of any. The Curates in Popery, be&s;ides their &s;aying Ma&s;s every day, their exactne&s;s to their breviary, their attending on confe&s;&s;ions and the multi|plicity of offices to which they are obliged, do &s;o labour in in&s;tructing the youth and vi&s;iting the &s;ick, that, in all the places in which I could ob&s;erve them, it &s;eemed to be the con&s;tant employment of their lives: And in the foreign Churches, tho' the labours of the Mini&s;ters may &s;eem mean, yet they are perpetually in them. All the&s;e things lay &s;o much on my thoughts, that I was re&s;olved to retire into &s;ome pri|vate place, and to &s;pend the re&s;t of my life in a cour&s;e of &s;tricter piety and devotion, and in writing &s;uch books, as the &s;tate of matters with relation to religion &s;hould call for, whether in points of &s;peculation or practice. All my friends advi&s;ed my coming near <HI>England,</HI> that I might be ea&s;ier &s;ent to, and informed of all our affairs, and might accordingly employ my thoughts and time. So I came down the <HI>Rhine</HI> this &s;ummer; and was re&s;olved to have &s;ettled in <HI>Groning</HI> or <HI>Frizeland.</HI></P>
<P>When I came to <HI>Utrecht,</HI> I found letters writ to me by &s;ome <NOTE PLACE="marg">I was invi|ted by the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> to come to the <HI>Hague.</HI></NOTE> of the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Court, de&s;iring me to come fir&s;t to the <HI>Hague,</HI> and wait on the Prince and Prince&s;s, before I &s;hould &s;ettle any where. Upon my coming to the <HI>Hague,</HI> I was admitted to wait on them. I found they had received &s;uch characters of me from <HI>England,</HI> that they re&s;olved to treat me with great confidence: For, at my fir&s;t being with them, they entred into much free di&s;cour&s;e with me concerning the affairs of <HI>England.</HI> The Prince, tho' naturally cold and re|&s;erved, yet laid a&s;ide a great deal of that with me. He &s;eem|ed highly di&s;&s;atisfied with the King's conduct. He appre|hended that he would give &s;uch jealou&s;ies of him&s;elf, and come under &s;uch jealou&s;ies from his people, that the&s;e would throw him into a <HI>French</HI> management, and engage him into &s;uch de&s;perate de&s;igns as would force violent remedies. There was a gravity in his whole deportment that &s;truck me. He
<PB N="689" REF="705">
&s;eemed very regardle&s;s of him&s;elf, and not apt to &s;u&s;pect de&s;igns upon his per&s;on. But I had learned &s;omewhat of the de&s;ign of a brutal <HI>Savoyard,</HI> who was capable of the blacke&s;t things, and who for a foul murder had fled into the territory of <HI>Geneva,</HI> where he lay hid in a very worthy family, to whom he had done &s;ome &s;ervices before. He had formed a &s;cheme of &s;eiz|ing on the Prince, who u&s;ed to go in his chariot often on the &s;ands near <HI>Schevling</HI> with but one per&s;on with him, and a page or two on the chariot. So he offered to go in a &s;mall ve&s;|&s;el of twenty guns, that &s;hould lie at &s;ome di&s;tance at &s;ea, and to land in a boat with &s;even per&s;ons be&s;ides him&s;elf, and to &s;eize on the Prince, and bring him aboard, and &s;o to <HI>France.</HI> This he wrote to Mr. <HI>de Louvoy,</HI> who upon that wrote to him to come to <HI>Paris,</HI> and ordered money for his journey. He, be|ing a talking man, &s;poke of this, and &s;hewed Mr. <HI>de Louvoy</HI>'s let|ter, and the copy of his own: And he went pre&s;ently to <HI>Paris.</HI> This was brought me by Mr. <HI>Fatio,</HI> the celebrated mathemati|cian, in who&s;e father's hou&s;e that per&s;on had lodged. When I told the Prince this, and had Mr. <HI>Fatio</HI> at the <HI>Hague</HI> to atte&s;t it, he was not much moved at it. The Prince&s;s was more appre|hen&s;ive. And by her direction I acquainted Mr. <HI>Fagell,</HI> and &s;ome others of the States, with it, who were convinced that the thing was practicable. And &s;o the States de&s;ired the Prince to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be con&s;tantly attended on by a guard when he went abroad, with which he was not without &s;ome difficulty brought to comply. I fancied his belief of prede&s;tination made him more adventurous than was nece&s;&s;ary. But he &s;aid as to that, he firm|ly believed a providence: For if he &s;hould let that go, all his religion would be much &s;haken: And he did not &s;ee, how pro|vidence could be certain, if all things did not ari&s;e out of the ab&s;olute will of God. I found tho&s;e who had the charge of his education had taken more care to po&s;&s;e&s;s him with the Cal|vini&s;tical notions of ab&s;olute decrees, than to guard him again&s;t the ill effects of tho&s;e opinions in practice: For in <HI>Holland</HI> the main thing the Mini&s;ters infu&s;e into their people is an abhorrence of the <HI>Arminian</HI> doctrine, which &s;preads &s;o much there, that their jealou&s;ies of it make them look after that, more than after the mo&s;t important matters.</P>
<P>The Prince had been much neglected in his education: For <NOTE PLACE="marg">A character of the Prince and Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange.</HI></NOTE> all his life long he hated con&s;traint. He &s;poke little. He put on &s;ome appearance of application: But he hated bu&s;ine&s;s of all &s;orts. Yet he hated talking, and all hou&s;e games, more. This put him on a perpetual cour&s;e of hunting, to which he &s;eemed to give him&s;elf up, beyond any man I ever knew: But I looked on that always, as a flying from company and bu&s;ine&s;s. The
<PB N="690" REF="706">
depre&s;&s;ion of <HI>France</HI> was the governing pa&s;&s;ion of his whole life. He had no vice, but of one &s;ort, in which he was very cautious and &s;ecret. He had a way that was affable and obliging to the <HI>Dutch.</HI> But he could not bring him&s;elf to comply enough with the temper of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> his coldne&s;s and &s;lowne&s;s being very contrary to the genius of the Nation.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all that conver&s;ed with her with admi|ration. Her per&s;on was maje&s;tick and created re&s;pect. She had great knowledge, with a true under&s;tanding, and a noble ex|pre&s;&s;ion. There was a &s;weetne&s;s in her deportment that charm|ed, and an exactne&s;s in piety and of vertue that made her a pat|tern to all that &s;aw her. The King gave her no appointments to &s;upport the dignity of a King's daughter. Nor did he &s;end her any pre&s;ents or jewels, which was thought a very indecent, and certainly was a very ill advi&s;ed thing. For the &s;ettling an allowance for her and the Prince, would have given &s;uch a jea|lou&s;y of them, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> would have apprehended a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence and confidence between them: And the not doing it &s;hewed the contrary very evidently. But, tho' the Prince did not increa&s;e her Court and State upon this additional dignity, &s;he managed her Privy Pur&s;e &s;o well, that &s;he became eminent in her charities: And the good grace with which &s;he be&s;towed fa|vours did always encrea&s;e their value. She had read much, both in hi&s;tory and divinity. And when a cour&s;e of humours in her eyes forced her from that, &s;he &s;et her &s;elf to work with &s;uch a con&s;tant diligence, that &s;he made the Ladies about her a&s;ham|ed to be idle. She knew little of our affairs, till I was admitted to wait on her. And I began to lay before her the &s;tate of our Court, and the intrigues in it, ever &s;ince the Re&s;toration; which &s;he received with great &s;atisfaction, and &s;hewed true judgment, and a good mind, in all the reflections that &s;he made. I will on|ly mention one in this place: She a&s;ked me, what had &s;harpned the King &s;o much again&s;t Mr. <HI>Jurieu,</HI> the copiou&s;e&s;t and the mo&s;t zealous writer of the age, who wrote with great vivacity as well as learning. I told her, he mixed all his books with a mo&s;t virulent acrimony of &s;tile, and among other things he had writ with great indecency of <HI>Mary</HI> Queen of <HI>Scots,</HI> which ca&s;t reflections on them that were de&s;cended from her; and was not very decent in one that de&s;ired to be con&s;idered as zealous for the Prince and her&s;elf. She &s;aid, <HI>Jurieu</HI> was to &s;upport the cau&s;e that he defended, and to expo&s;e tho&s;e that per&s;ecuted it, in the be&s;t way he could. And, if what he &s;aid of <HI>Mary</HI> Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> was true, he was not to be blamed, who made that u&s;e of it: And, &s;he added, that if Princes would do ill things, they mu&s;t ex|pect that the world will take revenges on their memory, &s;ince
<PB N="691" REF="707">
they cannot reach their per&s;ons: That was but a &s;mall &s;uffering, far &s;hort of what others &s;uffered at their hands. So far I have given the character of tho&s;e per&s;ons, as it appeared to me up|on my fir&s;t admittance to them. I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;ay much more of them in the &s;equel of this work.</P>
<P>I found the Prince was re&s;olved to make u&s;e of me. He told <NOTE PLACE="marg">I was much tru&s;ted by them.</NOTE> me, it would not be convenient for me to live any where but at the <HI>Hague:</HI> For none of the outlawed per&s;ons came thither. So I would keep my &s;elf by &s;taying there out of the danger that I might legally incur by conver&s;ing with them, which would be unavoidable if I lived any where el&s;e. He al&s;o recommended me both to <HI>Fagell, Dykvelt,</HI> and <HI>Halewyn's</HI> confidence, with whom he chiefly con&s;ulted. I had a mind to &s;ee a little into the Prince's notions, before I &s;hould engage my &s;elf deeper into his &s;ervice. I was afraid le&s;t his &s;truggle with the <HI>Louve&s;tein</HI> party, as they were called, might have given him a jealou&s;y of liberty and of a free government. He a&s;&s;ured me, it was quite the con|trary: Nothing but &s;uch a con&s;titution could re&s;i&s;t a powerful aggre&s;&s;or long, or have the credit that was nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e &s;uch &s;ums, as a great war might require. He condemned all the late proceedings in <HI>England</HI> with relation to the Charters, and expre&s;&s;ed his &s;en&s;e of a legal and limited authority very fully. I told him, I was &s;uch a friend to liberty, that I could not be &s;a|tisfied <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince's &s;en&s;e of our affairs.</NOTE> with the point of religion alone, unle&s;s it was accompa|nied with the &s;ecurities of law. I a&s;ked his &s;en&s;e of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> He &s;aid, he liked our wor&s;hip well, and our govern|ment in the Church, as much better than parity: But he blamed our condemning the foreign Churches, as he had ob&s;erved &s;ome of our Divines did. I told him, whatever &s;ome hotter men might $ay, all were not of that mind. When he found I was in my opinion for $oleration, he &s;aid, that was all he would ever de|&s;ire to bring us to, for quieting our contentions at home. He al&s;o promi&s;ed to me, that he &s;hould never be prevailed with to &s;et up the Calvini&s;tical notions of the decrees of God, to which I did imagine &s;ome might drive him. He wi&s;hed, &s;ome of our ceremonies, &s;uch as the Surplice, and the Cro&s;s in Bapti&s;m, with our bowing to the Altar, might be laid a&s;ide. I thought it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to enter with him into all the&s;e particulars, that &s;o I might be furni&s;hed from his own mouth to give a full account of his &s;en&s;e to &s;ome in <HI>England,</HI> who would expect it of me, and were di&s;po&s;ed to believe what I &s;hould a&s;&s;ure them of. This di&s;|cour&s;e was of &s;ome hours continuance: And it pa&s;t in the Prince&s;s's pre&s;ence. Great notice came to be taken of the free acce&s;s and long conferences I had with them both. I told him, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for his &s;ervice to put the fleet of <HI>Holland</HI> in a good condition.
<PB N="692" REF="708">
And this he propo&s;ed &s;oon after to the States, who gave the hun|dredth penny for a fund to perfect that. I moved to them both, the writing to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> and to the King concerning him. And, tho' the Prince&s;s feared it might irritate the King too much, in conclu&s;ion I per&s;uaded them to it.</P>
<P>The King, hearing of this admi&s;&s;ion I had, began in two or three letters to reflect on me, as a dangerous man, whom they ought to avoid and beware of. To this no an&s;wer was made. Upon the &s;etting up the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;ome from <HI>England</HI> pre&s;&s;ed them to write over again&s;t it, and to begin a breach upon that. I told them, I thought that was no way ad|vi&s;able: They could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand our laws &s;o well, as to oppo&s;e tho&s;e things on their own knowledge: So that, I thought, this could not be expected by them, till &s;ome re&s;olute per&s;on would di&s;pute the authority of the Court, and bring it to an argument, and &s;o to a &s;olemn deci&s;ion. $span$ like|wi&s;e &s;aid, that I did not think every error in government would warrant a breach: If the foundations were &s;truck at, that would vary the ca&s;e: But illegal acts in particular in&s;tances could not ju&s;tify &s;uch a conclu&s;ion. The Prince &s;eemed &s;urprized at this: For the King made me pa&s;s for a rebel in my heart. And he now &s;aw, how far I was from it. I continued on this ground to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>That which fixed me in their confidence was, the liberty I <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince&s;s's re&s;olution with re&s;pect to the Prince.</NOTE> took, in a private conver&s;ation with the Prince&s;s, to a&s;k her, what &s;he intended the Prince &s;hould be, if &s;he came to the Crown. She, who was new to all matters of that kind, did not under|&s;tand my meaning, but fancied that whatever accrewed to her would likewi&s;e accrue to him in the right of marriage. I told her, it was not &s;o: And I explained King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh's title to her, and what had pa&s;t when Queen <HI>Mary</HI> married <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> I told her, a titular King&s;hip was no acceptable thing to a man, e&s;pecially if it was to depend on another's life: And &s;uch a nominal dignity might endanger the real one that the Prince had in <HI>Holland.</HI> She de&s;ired me to propo&s;e a remedy. I told her, the remedy, if &s;he could bring her mind to it, was to be contented to be his wife, and to engage her&s;elf to him, that &s;he would give him the real authority as &s;oon as it came into her hands, and endeavour effectually to get it to be legally ve&s;ted in him during life: This would lay the greate&s;t obligation on him po&s;&s;ible, and lay the foundation of a perfect union betwen them, which had been of late a little embroiled: This would al&s;o give him another &s;en&s;e of all our affairs: I a&s;ked pardon for the pre&s;ump|tion of moving her in &s;uch a tender point: But I &s;olemnly pro|te&s;ted, that no per&s;on living had moved me in it, or &s;o much
<PB N="693" REF="709">
as knew of it, or &s;hould ever know of it, but as &s;he &s;hould or|der it. I hoped, &s;he would con&s;ider well of it: For, if &s;he once declared her mind, I hoped &s;he would never go back or retract it. I de&s;ired her therefore to take time to think of it. She pre&s;ently an&s;wered me, &s;he would take no time to con&s;ider of any thing by which &s;he could expre&s;s her regard $span$d affection to the Prince; and ordered me to give him an account of all that I had laid before her, and to bring him to her, and I &s;hould hear what &s;he would &s;ay upon it. He was that day a hunting: And next day I acquainted him with all that had pa&s;t, and car|ried him to her; where &s;he in a very frank manner told him, that &s;he did not know that the laws of <HI>England</HI> were &s;o contra|ry to the laws of God, as I had informed her: She did not think that the hu&s;band was ever to be obedient to the wife: She promi&s;ed him, he &s;hould always bear rule: And &s;he a&s;ked only, that he would obey the command of <HI>husbands love your wives,</HI> as &s;he &s;hould do that, <HI>wives be obedient to your husbands in all things.</HI> From this lively introduction we engaged into a long di&s;|cour&s;e of the affairs of <HI>England.</HI> Both &s;eemed well plea&s;ed with me, and with all that I had &s;ugge&s;ted. But &s;uch was the Prince's cold way, that he &s;aid not one word to me upon it, that look|ed like acknowledgment. Yet he &s;poke of it to &s;ome about him in another &s;train. He &s;aid, he had been nine years mar|ried, and had never the confidence to pre&s;s this matter on the Queen, which I had now brought about ea&s;ily in a day. Ever after that he &s;eemed to tru&s;t me entirely.</P>
<P>Complaints came daily over from <HI>England</HI> of all the high <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pen</HI> &s;ent o|ver to treat with the Prince.</NOTE> things that the Prie&s;ts were every where throwing out. <HI>Pen</HI> the Quaker came over to <HI>Holland.</HI> He was a talking vain man, who had been long in the King's favour, he being the Vice-Admi|ral's &s;on. He had &s;uch an opinion of his own faculty of per|&s;uading, that he thought none could &s;tand before it: Tho' he was &s;ingular in that opinion: For he had a tedious lu&s;cious way, that was not apt to overcome a man's rea&s;on, tho' it might tire his patience. He undertook to per&s;uade the Prince to come into the King's mea&s;ures, and had two or three long audiences of him upon the &s;ubject: And he and I &s;pent &s;ome hours together on it. The Prince readily con&s;ented to a toleration of Popery, as well as of the Di&s;&s;enters, provided it were propo&s;ed and pa&s;&s;ed in Parliament: And he promi&s;ed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if there was need of it, to get it to pa&s;s. But for the Te&s;ts he would enter into no treaty about them. He &s;aid, it was a plain betraying the &s;e|curity of the Prote&s;tant Religion, to give them up. Nothing was left un&s;aid, that might move him to agree to this in the way of intere&s;t: The King would enter into an entire confidence with
<PB N="694" REF="710">
him, and would put his be&s;t friends in the chief tru&s;ts. <HI>Pen</HI> un|dertook for this &s;o po&s;itively, that he &s;eemed to believe it him|&s;elf, or he was a great proficient in the art of di&s;&s;imulation. Many &s;u&s;pected that he was a concealed Papi&s;t. It is certain, he was much with Father <HI>Peter,</HI> and was particularly tru&s;ted by the Earl of <HI>Sunderland.</HI> So, tho' he did not pretend any commi&s;&s;ion for what he promi&s;ed, yet we looked on him as a man employ|ed. To all this the Prince an&s;wered, that no man was more for toleration in principle, than he was: He thought the con|&s;cience was only &s;ubject to God: And as far as a general tolera|tion, even of Papi&s;ts, would content the King, he would concur in it heartily: But he looked on the Te&s;ts as &s;uch a real &s;ecu|rity, and indeed the only one, when the King was of another Religion, that he would join in no coun&s;els with tho&s;e that in|tended to repeal tho&s;e laws that enacted them. <HI>Pen</HI> &s;aid, the King would have all or nothing: But that, if this was once done, the King would &s;ecure the toleration by a &s;olemn and unaltera|ble law. To this the late repeal of the edict of <HI>Nantes,</HI> that was declared perpetual and irrevocable, furni&s;hed an an&s;wer that admitted of no reply. So <HI>Pen</HI>'s negotiation with the Prince had no effect.</P>
<P>He pre&s;&s;ed me to go over to <HI>England,</HI> &s;ince I was in principle for toleration: And he a&s;&s;ured me the King would prefer me high|ly. I told him, &s;ince the Te&s;ts mu&s;t go with this toleration, I could never be for it. Among other di&s;cour&s;es he told me one thing, that was not accompli&s;hed in the way in which he had a mind I &s;hould believe it would be, but had a more &s;ur|pri&s;ing accompli&s;hment. He told me a long &s;eries of predic|tions, which, as he &s;aid, he had from a man that pretended a commerce with Angels, who had foretold many things that were pa&s;t very punctually. But he added, that in the year 1688 there would &s;uch a change happen in the face of affairs as would amaze all the world. And after the Revolution, which hap|pen'd that year, I a&s;ked him before much company, if that was the event that was predicted. He was unea&s;y at the que&s;tion; but did not deny what he had told me, which, he &s;aid, he un|der&s;tood of the full &s;ettlement of the Nation upon a toleration, by which he believed all men's minds would be perfectly quieted and united.</P>
<P>Now I go from this to pro&s;ecute the recital of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> affairs. Two eminent Bi&s;hops died this year, <HI>Pear&s;on</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Bi|&s;hops died in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Fell</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Oxford.</HI> The fir&s;t of the&s;e was in all re&s;pects the greate&s;t Divine of the age: A man of great learning, &s;trong rea&s;on, and of a clear judgment. He was a judicious and grave preacher, more in&s;tructive than affective; and a man of a &s;pot|le&s;s
<PB N="695" REF="711">
life, and of an excellent temper. His book on the Creed is among the be&s;t that our Church has produced. He was not active in his Dioce&s;e, but too remi&s;s and ea&s;y in his Epi&s;copal function; and was a much better Divine than a Bi&s;hop. He was a &s;peaking in&s;tance of what a great man could fall to: For his memory went from him &s;o entirely, that he became a child &s;ome years before he died.</P>
<P><HI>Fell,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Oxford,</HI> was a man of great &s;trictne&s;s in the cour&s;e of his life, and of much devotion. His learning appears in that noble edition of St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> that he publi&s;hed. He had made great beginnings in learning before the Re&s;toration: But his continued application to his employments after that &s;topt the progre&s;s that otherwi&s;e he might have made. He was made &s;oon after Dean of <HI>Chri&s;ts-Church,</HI> and afterwards Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ox|ford.</HI> He &s;et him&s;elf to promote learning in the Univer&s;ity, but mo&s;t particularly in his own College, which he governed with great care: And was indeed in all re&s;pects a mo&s;t exemplary man, a little too much heated in the matter of our di&s;putes with the Di&s;&s;enters. But, as he was among the fir&s;t of our Cler|gy that apprehended the de&s;ign of bringing in Popery, &s;o he was one of the mo&s;t zealous again&s;t it. He had much zeal for reforming abu&s;es; and managed it perhaps with too much heat, and in too peremptory a way. But we have &s;o little of that among us, that no wonder if &s;uch men are cen&s;ured by tho&s;e who love not &s;uch patterns, nor &s;uch &s;evere ta&s;k-ma&s;ters.</P>
<P><HI>Ward</HI> of <HI>Salisbury</HI> fell al&s;o under a lo&s;s of memory and un|der&s;tanding: So, that he, who was both in Mathematicks and Philo&s;ophy, and in the &s;trength of judgment and under&s;tand|ing, one of the fir&s;t men of his time, tho' he came too late into our profe&s;&s;ion to become very eminent in it, was now a great in&s;tance of the de&s;picable weakne&s;s to which man can fall. The Court intended once to have named a Coadjutor for him. But, there being no precedent for that &s;ince the Refor|mation, they re&s;olved to &s;tay till he &s;hould die.</P>
<P>The other two Bi&s;hopricks were le&s;s con&s;iderable: So they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cartwright</HI> and <HI>Parker</HI> promoted.</NOTE> re&s;olved to fill them with the two wor&s;t men that could be found out. <HI>Cartwright</HI> was promoted to <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> He was a man of good capacity, and had made &s;ome progre&s;s in learning. He was ambitious and &s;ervile, cruel and boi&s;terous: And, by the great liberties he allowed him&s;elf, he fell under much &s;candal of the wor&s;t &s;ort. He had &s;et him&s;elf long to rai&s;e the King's au|thority above law; which, he &s;aid, was only a method of go|vernment to which Kings might &s;ubmit as they plea&s;ed; but their authority was from God, ab&s;olute and &s;uperior to law, which they might exert, as oft as they found it nece&s;&s;ary for the
<PB N="696" REF="712">
ends of government. So he was looked on as a man that would more effectually advance the de&s;ign of Popery, than if he &s;hould turn over to it. And indeed, bad as he was, he never made that &s;tep, even in the mo&s;t de&s;perate &s;tate of his affairs.</P>
<P>The See of <HI>Oxford</HI> was given to Dr. <HI>Parker,</HI> who was a vio|lent Independent at the time of the Re&s;toration, with a high profe&s;&s;ion of piety in their way. But he &s;oon changed, and &s;truck into the highe&s;t form of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and wrote many books with a &s;train of contempt and fury again&s;t all the Di&s;&s;enters, that provoked them out of mea&s;ure; of which an account was given in the hi&s;tory of the former reign. He had exalted the King's authority in matters of religion in &s;o indecent a manner, that he condemned the ordinary form of &s;aying the King was under God and Chri&s;t, as a crude and profane expre&s;&s;ion; &s;aying, that tho' the King was indeed un|der God, yet he was not under Chri&s;t, but above him. Yet, not being preferred as he expected, he writ after that many books on de&s;ign to rai&s;e the authority of the Church to an in|dependance on the Civil power. There was an entertaining live|line&s;s in all his books: But it was neither grave nor correct. He was a covetous and ambitious man; and &s;eemed to have no other &s;en&s;e of religion but as a political intere&s;t, and a &s;ub|ject of party and faction. He &s;eldom came to prayers, or to any exerci&s;es of devotion; and was &s;o lifted up with pride, that he was become in&s;ufferable to all that came near him. The&s;e two men were pitched on, as the fitte&s;t in&s;truments that could be found among all the Clergy, to betray and ruin the Church. Some of the Bi&s;hops brought to Archbi&s;hop <HI>Sancroft</HI> articles again&s;t them, which they de&s;ired he would offer to the King in Council, and pray that the Mandate for con&s;ecrating them might be delayed, till time were given to examine particulars. And Bi&s;hop <HI>Lloyd</HI> told me, that <HI>Sancroft</HI> promi&s;ed to him not to con&s;ecrate them, till he had examined the truth of the ar|ticles; of which &s;ome were too &s;candalous to be repeated. Yet, when <HI>Sancroft</HI> &s;aw what danger he might incur, if he were &s;ued in a <HI>Premunire,</HI> he con&s;ented to con&s;ecrate them.</P>
<P>The Deanry of <HI>Chri&s;ts-Church,</HI> the mo&s;t important po&s;t in the Univer&s;ity, was given to <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey,</HI> one of the new converts, tho' he had neither the gravity, the learning, nor the age that was &s;uitable to &s;uch a dignity. But all was &s;upplied by his early conver&s;ion: And it was &s;et up for a maxim, to encourage all converts. He at fir&s;t went to prayers in the Chapel. But &s;oon after he declared him&s;elf more openly. Not long after this the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Magdalen</HI> College died. That is e&s;teemed the riche&s;t foundation in <HI>England,</HI> perhaps in <HI>Europe:</HI> For, tho' their
<PB N="697" REF="713">
certain rents are but about 4 or 5000 <HI>l.</HI> yet it is thought that the improved value of the e&s;tate belonging to it is about 40000 <HI>l.</HI> So it was no wonder that the Prie&s;ts &s;tudied to get this en|dowment into their hands.</P>
<P>They had endeavoured to break in upon the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Cambridge</HI> in a matter of le&s;s importance, but without &s;ucce&s;s: And now they re&s;olved to attack <HI>Oxford,</HI> by a &s;trange fatality in their coun&s;els. In all nations the privileges of Colleges and Univer&s;ities are e&s;teemed &s;uch &s;acred things, that few will ven|ture to di&s;pute the&s;e, much le&s;s to di&s;turb them, when their title is good, and their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is of a long continuance: For in the&s;e, not only the pre&s;ent body e&s;pou&s;es the matter; but all who have been of it, even tho&s;e that have only followed their &s;tudy in it, think them&s;elves bound in honour and grati|tude to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport them. The Prie&s;ts began where they ought to have ended, when all other things were brought about to their mind. The Je&s;uits fancied, that, if they could get foot|ing in the Univer&s;ity, they would gain &s;uch a reputation by their methods of teaching youth, that they would carry them away from the Univer&s;ity tutors, who were certainly too re|mi&s;s. Some of the more moderate among them propo&s;ed, that the King &s;hould endow a new College in both Univer&s;ities, which needed not have co&s;t above two thou&s;and pound a year, and in the&s;e &s;et his Prie&s;ts to work. But either the King &s;tuck at the charge which this would put him to, or his Prie&s;ts thought it too mean and below his dignity not to lay his hand upon tho&s;e great bodies: So rougher methods were re&s;olved on. It was reckoned, that by frightning them they might be driven to compound the matter, and deliver up one or two Colleges to them: And then, as the King &s;aid &s;ometimes in the circle, they who taught be&s;t would be mo&s;t followed.</P>
<P>They began with <HI>Cambridge</HI> upon a &s;ofter point, which yet <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's letter re|fu&s;ed in <HI>Cambridge.</HI></NOTE> would have made way for all the re&s;t. The King &s;ent his let|ter, or <HI>Mandamus,</HI> to order <HI>F. Francis,</HI> an ignorant Benedictine Monk, to be received a Ma&s;ter of Arts; once to open the way for letting them into the degrees of the Univer&s;ity. The truth is, the King's letters were &s;carce ever refu&s;ed in conferring de|grees: And when Emba&s;&s;adors or foreign Princes came to tho&s;e places, they u&s;ually gave &s;uch degrees to tho&s;e who belonged to them as were de&s;ired. The <HI>Morocco</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador's Secretary, that was a Mahometan, had that degree given him, but a great di&s;tinction was made between honorary degrees given to &s;trangers, who intended not to live among them, and tho&s;e given to &s;uch as intended to &s;ettle among them: For every Ma&s;ter of Arts having a vote in the Convocation, they reckoned, that, if they
<PB N="698" REF="714">
gave this degree, they mu&s;t give all that &s;hould be pretended to on the like authority: And they knew, all the King's Prie&s;ts would be let in upon them, which might occa&s;ion in pre&s;ent great di&s;traction and contentions among them; and in time they might grow to be a majority in the Convocation, which is their Parliament. They refu&s;ed the <HI>Mandamus</HI> with great una|nimity, and with a firmne&s;s that the Court had not expected from them. New and repeated orders, full of &s;evere threat|nings in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience, were &s;ent to them: And this piece of raillery was every where &s;et up, that a Papi&s;t was reckoned wor&s;e than a Mahometan, and that the King's letters were le&s;s con&s;idered than the Emba&s;&s;ador from <HI>Morocco</HI> had been. Some feeble or fal&s;e men of the Univer&s;ity tried to compound the matter, by granting this degree to <HI>F. Francis,</HI> but enacting at the &s;ame time, that it &s;hould not be a precedent for the future for any other of the like nature. This was not given way to: For it was &s;aid, that in all &s;uch ca&s;es the obedience that was once paid would be a much &s;tronger argument for continu|ing to do it, as oft as it &s;hould be de&s;ired, than any &s;uch pro|vi&s;o could be again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Upon this the Vice-Chancellor was &s;ummoned before the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vice-Chancellor turned out by the Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Commi&s;&s;i|oners.</NOTE> Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Commi&s;&s;ion to an&s;wer this contempt. He was a very hone&s;t, but a very weak man. He made a poor defence. And it was no &s;mall reflection on that great body, that their chief Magi&s;trate was &s;o little able to a&s;&s;ert their privileges, or to ju&s;tify their proceedings. He was treated with great con|tempt by <HI>Jefferies.</HI> But he having acted only as the chief per&s;on of that body, all that was thought fit to be done again&s;t him was, to turn him out of his office. That was but an annual office, and of no profit: So this was a &s;light cen&s;ure, chiefly when it was all that followed on &s;uch heavy threatnings. The Univer&s;ity cho&s;e another Vice-Chancellor, who was a man of much &s;pirit: And in his &s;peech, which in cour&s;e he made upon his being cho&s;en, he promi&s;ed, that, during his ma|gi&s;tracy, neither religion, nor the rights of the body, &s;hould &s;uf|fer by his means. The Court did not think fit to in&s;i&s;t more upon this matter; which was too plain a confe&s;&s;ion, either of their weakne&s;s in beginning &s;uch an ill grounded attempt, or of their feeblene&s;s in letting it fall, doing &s;o little, after they had talked &s;o much about it. And now all people began to &s;ee, that they had taken wrong mea&s;ures of the King, when they thought that it would be ea&s;y to engage him into bold things, before he could &s;ee into the ill con&s;equences that might attend them, but that being once engaged he would re&s;olve to go through with them at all adventures. When I knew him,
<PB N="699" REF="715">
he &s;eemed to have &s;et up that for a maxim, that a King when he made a &s;tep was never to go back, nor to encourage facti|on and di&s;obedience by yielding to it.</P>
<P>After this un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt upon <HI>Cambridge,</HI> another was <NOTE PLACE="marg">An attempt to impo&s;e a Popi&s;h Pre&s;i|dent on <HI>Magdalen</HI> College.</NOTE> made upon <HI>Oxford,</HI> that la&s;ted longer and had greater effects; which I &s;hall &s;et all down together, tho' the conclu&s;ion of this affair ran far into the year after this that I now write of. The Pre&s;ident&s;hip of <HI>Magdalen</HI>'s was given by the election of the Fellows. So the King &s;ent a <HI>Mandamus,</HI> requiring them to choo&s;e one <HI>Farmer,</HI> an ignorant and vitious per&s;on, who had not one qualification that could recommend him to &s;o high a po&s;t, be|&s;ides that of changing his religion. <HI>Mandamus</HI> letters had no legal authority in them: But all the great preferments of the Church being in the King's di&s;po&s;al, tho&s;e who did pretend to favour, were not apt to refu&s;e his recommendation, le&s;t that &s;hould be afterwards remembred to their prejudice. But now, &s;ince it was vi&s;ible in what channel favour was like to run, le&s;s regard was had to &s;uch a letter. The Fellows of that hou&s;e did upon this choo&s;e Dr. <HI>Hough,</HI> one of their body, who as he was in all re&s;pects a &s;tatutable man, &s;o he was a worthy and a firm man, not apt to be threatned out of his right. They carried their election according to their &s;tatutes to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> their Vi&s;itor: And he confirmed it. So that matter was legally &s;ettled. This was highly re&s;ented at Court. It was &s;aid, that, in ca&s;e of a <HI>Mandamus</HI> for an unde&s;erving man, they ought to have repre&s;ented the matter to the King, and &s;taid till they had his plea&s;ure: It was one of the chief &s;ervices that the Univer&s;ities expected from their Chancellors, which made them always choo&s;e men of great credit at Court, that by their intere&s;t &s;uch letters might be either prevented or recalled. The Duke of <HI>Ormond</HI> was now their Chancellor: But he had little credit in the Court; and was declining in his age, which made him retire into the country. It was much ob&s;erved, that this Uni|ver&s;ity, that had a&s;&s;erted the King's prerogative in the highe&s;t &s;trains of the mo&s;t abject flattery po&s;&s;ible, both in their addre&s;&s;es, and in a wild decree they had made but three years before this, in which they had laid together a &s;et of &s;uch high flown max|ims as mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h an uncontrolable tyranny, &s;hould be the fir&s;t body of the Nation that &s;hould feel the effects of it mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly. The cau&s;e was brought before the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Com|mi&s;&s;ion. The Fellows were fir&s;t a&s;ked, why they had not cho&s;en <HI>Farmer</HI> in obedience to the King's letter? And to that they an|&s;wered, by offering a li&s;t of many ju&s;t exceptions again&s;t him. The &s;ubject was fruitful, and the &s;candals he had given were very publick. The Court was a&s;hamed of him, and in&s;i&s;ted no
<PB N="700" REF="716">
more on him: But they &s;aid, that the Hou&s;e ought to have &s;hew|ed more re&s;pect to the King's letter, than to have proceeded to an election in contempt of it.</P>
<P>The Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Commi&s;&s;ion took upon them to declare <NOTE PLACE="marg">They di&s;o|bey, and are cen&s;ured for it.</NOTE> <HI>Hough</HI>'s election null, and to put the Hou&s;e under &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. And, that the de&s;ign of the Court in this matter might be car|ried on without the load of recommending a Papi&s;t, <HI>Parker,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Oxford,</HI> was now recommended: And the Fellows were commanded to proceed to a new election in his favour. They excu&s;ed them&s;elves, &s;ince they were bound by their oaths to maintain their &s;tatutes: And by the&s;e, an election being once made and confirmed, they could not proceed to a new choice, till the former was annulled in &s;ome Court of law: Church benefices and College preferments were freeholds, and could on|ly be judged in a Court of Record: And, &s;ince the King was now talking &s;o much of liberty of con&s;cience, it was &s;aid, that the forcing men to act again&s;t their oaths, &s;eemed not to agree with tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions. In oppo&s;ition to this it was &s;aid, that the &s;tatutes of Colleges had been always con&s;idered, as things that depended entirely on the King's good plea&s;ure; &s;o that no oaths to ob&s;erve them could bind them, when it was in oppo&s;i|tion to the King's command.</P>
<P>This did not &s;atisfy the Fellows: And, tho' the King, as he <NOTE PLACE="marg">1687</NOTE> went thro' <HI>Oxford</HI> in his progre&s;s in the year 1687, &s;ent for them, and ordered them to go pre&s;ently and choo&s;e <HI>Parker</HI> for their Pre&s;ident, in a &s;train of language ill &s;uited to the Ma|je&s;ty of a crowned head, (for he treated them with foul lan|guage pronounced in a very angry tone;) yet it had no effect on them. They in&s;i&s;ted &s;till on their oaths, tho' with a humili|ty and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, that they hoped would have mollified him. They continued thus firm. A &s;ubaltern Commi&s;&s;ion was &s;ent from the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Commi&s;&s;ion to fini&s;h the matter. Bi&s;hop <HI>Cart|wright</HI> was the head of this Commi&s;&s;ion, as Sir <HI>Charles Hedges</HI> was the King's Advocate to manage the matter. <HI>Cartwright</HI> act|ed in &s;o rough a manner, that it &s;hewed, he was re&s;olved to &s;acrifice all things to the King's plea&s;ure. It was an afflicting thing, which &s;eemed to have a peculiar character of indigni|ty in it, that this fir&s;t act of violence committed again&s;t the legal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Church, was executed by one Bi&s;hop, and done in favour of another.</P>
<P>The new Pre&s;ident was turned out. And, becau&s;e he would <NOTE PLACE="marg">And were all turned out.</NOTE> not deliver the keys of his Hou&s;e, the doors were broken open: And <HI>Parker</HI> was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The Fellows were required to make their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to a&s;k pardon for what was pa&s;t, and

to accept of the Bi&s;hop for their Pre&s;ident. They &s;till pleaded their oath: And were all turned out, except two that &s;ubmit|ted. So that it was expected, to &s;ee that Hou&s;e &s;oon &s;tockt with Papi&s;ts. The Nation, as well as the Univer&s;ity, looked on all this proceeding with a ju&s;t indignation. It was thought an open piece of robbery and burglary, when men, authorized by no legal commi&s;&s;ion, came and forcibly turned men out of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and freehold. This agreed ill with the profe&s;&s;i|ons that the King was &s;till making, that he would maintain the Church of <HI>England</HI> as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed: For this &s;truck at the whole e&s;tate, and all the temporalties of the Church. It did &s;o inflame the Church party and the Clergy, that they &s;ent over very pre&s;&s;ing me&s;&s;ages upon it to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> de|&s;iring that he would interpo&s;e, and e&s;pou&s;e the concerns of the Church; and that he would break upon it, if the King would not redre&s;s it. This I did not &s;ee in their letters. Tho&s;e were of &s;uch importance, &s;ince the writing them might have been carried to high trea&s;on, that the Prince did not think fit to &s;hew them. But he often &s;aid, he was pre&s;&s;ed by many of tho&s;e, who were afterwards his bittere&s;t enemies, to engage in their quarrel. When that was communicated to me, I was &s;till of opinion, that, tho' this was indeed an act of de&s;potical and arbitra|ry power, yet I did not think it &s;truck at the whole: So that it was not in my opinion a lawful ca&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance: And I could not concur in a quarrel occa&s;ioned by &s;uch a &s;ingle act, tho' the precedent &s;et by it might go to every thing.</P>
<P>Now the King broke with the Church of <HI>England.</HI> And, as he was apt to go warmly upon every provocation, he gave him|&s;elf &s;uch liberties in di&s;cour&s;e upon that &s;ubject, that it was plain, all the &s;ervices they had done him, both in oppo&s;ing the Ex|clu&s;ion, and upon his fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, were for|got. Agents were now found out, to go among the Di&s;&s;en|ters, to per&s;uade them to accept of the favour the King intend|ed them, and to concur with him in his de&s;igns.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enters were divided into four main bodies. The Pre&s;|byterians, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Di&s;&s;en|ters were much court|ed by the King.</NOTE> the Independents, the Anabapti&s;ts, and the Quakers. The two former had not the vi&s;ible di&s;tinction of different rites: And their depre&s;&s;ed condition made, that the di&s;pute about the con&s;titution and &s;ubordination of Churches, which had broken them when power was in their hands, was now out of doors: And they were looked on as one body, and were above three parts in four of all the Di&s;&s;enters. The main difference between the&s;e was, that the Pre&s;byterians &s;eemed reconcilable to the Church; for they loved Epi&s;copal Ordination and a Liturgy, and upon &s;ome amendments &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to come into the Church;
<PB N="702" REF="718">
and they liked the civil government, and limited Monarchy. But as the Independents were for a Commonwealth in the State, &s;o they put all the power of the Church in the people, and thought that their choice was an ordination: Nor did they ap|prove of &s;et forms of wor&s;hip. Both were enemies to this high prerogative, that the King was a&s;&s;uming, and were very aver&s;e to Popery. They generally were of a mind, as to the accept|ing the King's favour; but were not inclined to take in the Papi&s;ts into a full toleration; much le&s;s could they be prevall|ed on to concur in taking off the Te&s;ts. The Anabapti&s;ts were generally men of vertue, and of an univer&s;al charity: And as they were far from being in any treating terms with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> &s;o nothing but an univer&s;al toleration could make them capable of favour or employments. The Quakers had &s;et up &s;uch a vi&s;ible di&s;tinction in the matter of the Hat, and &s;aying Thou and Thee, that they had all as it were a badge fix|ed on them: So they were ea&s;ily known. Among the&s;e <HI>Pen</HI> had the greate&s;t credit, as he had a free acce&s;s at Court. To all the&s;e it was propo&s;ed, that the King de&s;igned the &s;ettling the minds of the different parties in the Nation, and the en|riching it by enacting a perpetual law, that &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed with &s;uch &s;olemnities as had accompanied the <HI>Magna Charta;</HI> &s;o that not only penal laws &s;hould be for ever repealed, but that publick employments &s;hould be opened to men of all per&s;ua&s;i|ons, without any te&s;ts or oaths limiting them to one &s;ort or party of men. There were many meetings among the leading men of the &s;everal &s;ects.</P>
<P>It was vi&s;ible to all men, that the courting them at this time <NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates and re&s;olutions among them.</NOTE> was not from any kindne&s;s or good opinion that the King had of them. They had left the Church of <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e of &s;ome forms in it, that they thought looked too like the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> They needed not to be told, that all the favour ex|pected from Popery was once to bring it in, under the colour of a general toleration, till it &s;hould be &s;trong enough to &s;et on a general per&s;ecution: And therefore, as they could not engage them&s;elves to &s;upport &s;uch an arbitrary prerogative as was now made u&s;e of, &s;o neither &s;hould they go into any engagements for Popery. Yet they re&s;olved to let the points of controver|&s;y alone, and leave tho&s;e to the management of the Clergy, who had a legal bottom to &s;upport them. They did believe, that this indignation again&s;t the Church party, and this kindne&s;s to them were things too unnatural to la&s;t long. So the more con&s;iderable among them re&s;olved not to &s;tand at too great a di&s;tance from the Court, nor to provoke the King &s;o far, as to give him cau&s;e to think they were irreconcilable to him, le&s;t
<PB N="703" REF="719">
they &s;hould provoke him to make up matters on any terms with the Church party. On the other hand, they re&s;olved not to provoke the Church party, or by any ill behaviour of theirs drive them into a reconciliation with the Court. It is true, <HI>Pen</HI> &s;hewed both a &s;corn of the Clergy, and virulent &s;pite again&s;t them, in which he had not many followers.</P>
<P>The King was &s;o fond of his Army, that he ordered them <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Army encamped at <HI>Houn&s;low-Heath.</HI></NOTE> to encamp on <HI>Houn&s;low-Heath,</HI> and to be exerci&s;ed all the &s;um|mer long. This was done with great magnificence, and at a va&s;t expence, but that which abated the King's joy in &s;eeing &s;o brave an Army about him was, that it appeared vi&s;ibly, and on many occa&s;ions, that his &s;oldiers had as great an aver&s;ion to his religion, as his other &s;ubjects had expre&s;&s;ed. The King had a Chapel in his camp, where Ma&s;s was &s;aid: But &s;o few went to it, and tho&s;e few were treated by the re&s;t with &s;o much &s;corn, that it was not ea&s;y to bear it. It was very plain, that &s;uch an Army was not to be tru&s;ted in any quarrel in which religion was concerned.</P>
<P>The few Papi&s;ts that were in the Army were an unequal match to the re&s;t. The heats about religion were like to breed quar|rels: And it was once very near a mutiny. It was thought, that the&s;e encampments had a good effect on the Army. They en|couraged one another, and vowed they would &s;tick together, and never for&s;ake their religion. It was no &s;mall comfort to them, to &s;ee they had &s;o few Papi&s;ts among them; which might have been better di&s;gui&s;ed at a di&s;tance, than when they were all in view. A re&s;olution was formed upon this at Court to make $span$ruits in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and to fill them up with <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Papi&s;ts; which &s;ucceeded as ill as all their other de&s;igns did, as &s;hall be told in its proper place.</P>
<P>The King had for above a year managed his corre&s;pondence <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Emba&s;|&s;ador &s;ent to <HI>Rome.</HI></NOTE> with <HI>Rome</HI> &s;ecretly. But now the Prie&s;ts re&s;olved to drive the matter pa&s;t reconciling. The corre&s;pondence with that Court, while there was none at <HI>Rome</HI> with a publick character, could not be decently managed, but by Cardinal <HI>Howard</HI>'s means. He was no friend to the Je&s;uits; nor did he like their over driving matters. So they moved to the King to &s;end an Emba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Rome.</HI> This was high trea&s;on by law. <HI>Jefferies</HI> was very un|ea&s;y in it. But the King's power of pardoning had been much argued in the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI>'s ca&s;e, and was believed to be one of the unque&s;tionable rights of the Crown. So he knew a &s;afe way in committing crimes; which was, to take out pardons as &s;oon as he had done illegal things.</P>
<P>The King's choice of <HI>Palmer,</HI> Earl of <HI>Ca&s;tlemain,</HI> was liable to great exception. For, as he was believed to be a Je&s;uit, &s;o
<PB N="704" REF="720">
he was certainly as hot and eager in all high notions, as any of them could be. The <HI>Romans</HI> were amazed, when they heard that he was to be the per&s;on. His mi&s;fortunes were &s;o emi|nent and publick, that they, who take their mea&s;ures much from a&s;trology, and from the characters they think are fixed on men, thought it &s;trange to &s;ee &s;uch a negotiation put in the hands of &s;o unlucky a man. It was managed with great &s;plendor, and at a va&s;t charge.</P>
<P>He was unhappy in every &s;tep of it. He di&s;puted with a nice <NOTE PLACE="marg">He managed every thing unhappily.</NOTE> &s;ort of affectation every punctilio of the ceremonial. And, when the day &s;et for his audience came, there happen'd to be &s;uch an extraordinary thunder, and &s;uch deluges of rain, as di&s;graced the &s;hew, and heightned the opinion of the ominou&s;ne&s;s of this Emba&s;&s;y. After this was over, he had yet many di&s;putes with relation to the ceremony of vi&s;its. The points he pre&s;&s;ed were, fir&s;t the making <HI>P. Renaldi</HI> of <HI>E&s;te,</HI> the Queen's uncle, a Cardinal; in which he prevailed: And it was the only point in which he &s;ucceeded. He tried, if it was po&s;&s;ible, to get Father <HI>Petre</HI> to be made a Cardinal. But the Pope was known to be intractable in that point, having fixed it as a maxim not to rai&s;e any of that Order to the Purple. Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> told me, as he came from <HI>Spain,</HI> that our Court had pre&s;&s;ed the Court of <HI>Spain</HI> to join their intere&s;t with ours at <HI>Rome</HI> for his promo|tion. They gave it out, that he was a <HI>German</HI> by birth, and undertook that he &s;hould &s;erve the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> intere&s;t. They al&s;o promi&s;ed the Court of <HI>Madrid</HI> great a&s;&s;i&s;tance in other matters of the la&s;t importance, if they would procure this: Adding, that this would prove the mo&s;t effectual means for the conver|&s;ion of <HI>England.</HI> Upon which the Count told me, he was a&s;k|ed concerning Father <HI>Petre.</HI> He, who had gone often to <HI>Spain</HI> thro' <HI>England,</HI> happen'd to know that Je&s;uit; and told them, he was no <HI>German,</HI> but an <HI>Engli&s;hman.</HI> They tried their &s;trength at <HI>Rome</HI> for his promotion, but with no &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The Emba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Rome</HI> pre&s;&s;ed Cardinal <HI>Cibo</HI> much to put an end to the differences between the Pope and the King of <HI>France,</HI> in the matter of the franchi&s;es, that it might appear that the Pope had a due regard to a King that had extirpated here&s;y, and to another King who was endeavouring to bring other Kingdoms into the &s;heepfold. What mu&s;t the world &s;ay, if two &s;uch Kings, like whom no ages had produced any, &s;hould be neglected and ill u&s;ed at <HI>Rome</HI> for &s;ome punctilios? He ad|ded, that, if the&s;e matters were &s;ettled, and if the Pope would enter into concert with them, they would &s;et about the de|&s;troying here&s;y every where, and would begin with the <HI>Dutch;</HI> upon whom, he &s;aid, they would fall without any declaration
<PB N="705" REF="721">
of war, treating them as a company of rebels and pirates, who had not a right, as free States and Princes have, to a formal denunci|ation of war. <HI>Cibo,</HI> who was then Cardinal Patron, was amaz|ed at this, and gave notice of it to the Imperial Cardinals. They &s;ent it to the Emperor, and he &s;ignified it to the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> It is certain, that one Prince's treating with ano|ther to invade a third gives a right to that third Prince to defend him&s;elf, and to prevent tho&s;e de&s;igns. And, &s;ince what an Em|ba&s;&s;ador &s;ays is under&s;tood as &s;aid by the Prince who&s;e charac|ter he bears, this gave the States a right to make u&s;e of all ad|vantages that might offer them&s;elves. But they had yet better grounds to ju&s;tify their proceedings, as will appear in the &s;e|quel.</P>
<P>When the Emba&s;&s;ador &s;aw that his remon&s;trances to the Car|dinal Patron were ineffectual, he demanded an audience of the Pope. And there he lamented, that &s;o little regard was had to two &s;uch great Kings. He reflected on the Pope, as &s;hewing more zeal about temporal concerns than the &s;piritual; which, he &s;aid, gave &s;candal to all Chri&s;tendom. He concluded, that, &s;ince he &s;aw interce&s;&s;ions made in his ma&s;ter's name were &s;o little con&s;idered, he would make ha&s;te home: To which the Pope made no other an&s;wer, but, <HI>lei &egrave; padrone,</HI> he might do as he plea&s;ed. But he &s;ent one after the Emba&s;&s;ador, as he withdrew from the audience, to let him know, how much he was offend|ed with his di&s;cour&s;es, that he received no &s;uch treatment from any per&s;on, and that the Emba&s;&s;ador was to expect no other private audience. Cardinal <HI>Howard</HI> did what he could to &s;often matters. But the Emba&s;&s;ador was &s;o entirely in the hands of the Je&s;uits, that he had little regard to any thing that the Cardinal &s;ugge&s;ted. And &s;o he left <HI>Rome</HI> after a very ex|pen&s;eful, but in&s;ignificant Emba&s;&s;y.</P>
<P>The Pope &s;ent in return a Nuntio, <HI>Dada,</HI> now a Cardinal <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pope <HI>Inno|cent</HI>'s cha|racter.</NOTE> He was highly civil in all his deportment. But it did not ap|pear that he was a man of great depth, nor had he power to do much. The Pope was a jealous and fearful man, who had no knowledge of any &s;ort, but in the matters of the revenue, and of money: For he was de&s;cended from a family, that was become rich by dealing in banks. And, in that re&s;pect, it was a happine&s;s to the Papacy that he was advanced: For it was &s;o involved in va&s;t debts by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of many wa&s;tful Pontifi|cates, that his frugal management came in good time to &s;et tho&s;e matters in better order. It was known, that he did not &s;o much as under&s;tand <HI>Latin.</HI> I was told at <HI>Rome,</HI> that when he was made Cardinal, he had a ma&s;ter to teach him to pronounce that little <HI>Latin</HI> that he had occa&s;ion for at high
<PB N="706" REF="722">
Ma&s;&s;es. He under&s;tood nothing of Divinity. I remembred what a Je&s;uit at <HI>Venice</HI> had &s;aid to me, whom I met &s;ometimes at the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;adors there, when we were talking of the Pope's infallibility: He &s;aid, that being in <HI>Rome</HI> during <HI>Altieri</HI>'s Pontificate, who lived &s;ome years in a perfect dotage, he con|fe&s;&s;ed it required a very &s;trong faith to believe him infallible: But he added plea&s;antly, the harder it was to believe it, the act of faith was the more meritorious. The &s;ubmitting to Pope <HI>In|nocent</HI>'s infalibillity was a very implicit act of faith, when all appearances were &s;o &s;trongly again&s;t it. The Pope hated the Je&s;uits, and expre&s;&s;ed a great e&s;teem for the <HI>Jan&s;eni&s;ts;</HI> not that he under&s;tood the ground of the difference, but becau&s;e they were enemies to the Je&s;uits, and were ill looked on by the Court of <HI>France.</HI> He under&s;tood the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Regale a little better, it relating to the temporalties of the Church. And there|fore he took all tho&s;e under his protection, who refu&s;ed to &s;ub|mit to it. Things &s;eemed to go far towards a breach between the two Courts: E&s;pecially after the articles, which were &s;et out by the A&s;&s;embly of the Clergy of <HI>France</HI> in the year 1682, in favour of the Councils of <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;ile,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to the Papal preten&s;ions. The King of <HI>France,</HI> who was not ac|cu&s;tomed to be treated in &s;uch a manner, &s;ent many threatning me&s;&s;ages to <HI>Rome,</HI> which alarmed the Cardinals &s;o much, that they tried to mollify the Pope. But it was reported at <HI>Rome,</HI> that he made a noble an&s;wer to them, when they a&s;ked him, what he could do, if &s;o great a King &s;hould &s;end an Army to fall upon him? He &s;aid, he could &s;uffer Martyrdom.</P>
<P>He was &s;o little terrified with all tho&s;e threatnings, that he <NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;putes a|bout the franchi&s;es.</NOTE> had &s;et on foot a di&s;pute about the franchi&s;es. In <HI>Rome</HI> all tho&s;e of a Nation put them&s;elves under the protection of their Emba&s;&s;ador, and are upon occa&s;ions of ceremony his Cortege. The&s;e were u&s;ually lodged in his neighbourhood, pretending that they belonged to him. So that they exempted them&s;elves from the orders and ju&s;tice of <HI>Rome,</HI> as a part of the Emba&s;&s;ador's family. And that extent of hou&s;es or &s;treets in which they lodg|ed was called the franchi&s;es; for in it they pretended they were not &s;ubject to the government of <HI>Rome.</HI> This had made the&s;e hou&s;es to be well filled, not only with tho&s;e of that Nation, but with &s;uch <HI>Romans</HI> as de&s;ired to be covered with that pro|tection. <HI>Rome</HI> was now much &s;unk from what it had been: So that the&s;e franchi&s;es were become &s;o great a part of the City, that the privileges of tho&s;e that lived in them were giving every day new di&s;turbances to the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, and were the common &s;anctuaries of criminals. So the Pope re&s;olved to reduce the privileges of Emba&s;&s;adors to their own families,
<PB N="707" REF="723">
within their own palaces. He fir&s;t dealt with the Emperor's, and the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Emba&s;&s;adors: And brought them to quit their preten&s;ions to the franchi&s;es, but with this provi&s;ion, that, if the <HI>French</HI> did not the &s;ame, they would return to them. So now the Pope was upon forcing the <HI>French</HI> to &s;ubmit to the &s;ame methods. The Pope &s;aid, his Nuntio or Legate at <HI>Paris</HI> had no privi|lege but for his family, and for tho&s;e that lived in his palace. The <HI>French</HI> rejected this with great &s;corn. They &s;aid, the Pope was not to pretend to an equality with &s;o great a King. He was the common Father of Chri&s;tendom: So tho&s;e who came thither, as to the center of unity, were not to be put on the level with the Emba&s;&s;adors that pa&s;&s;ed between Sovereign Princes. Upon this the King of <HI>France</HI> pretended, that he would maintain all the privileges and franchi&s;es that his Emba&s;&s;adors were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. This was now growing up to be the mat|ter of a new quarrel, and of fre&s;h di&s;putes, between tho&s;eCourts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador being &s;o entirely in the <HI>French</HI> in|tere&s;ts, and in the confidence of the Je&s;uits, he was much le&s;s con&s;idered at <HI>Rome,</HI> than he thought he ought to have been. The truth is, the <HI>Romans,</HI> as they have very little &s;en&s;e of re|ligion, &s;o they con&s;idered the reduction of <HI>England</HI> as a thing impracticable. They &s;aw no pro&s;pect of any profits like to ari&s;e in any of their offices by bulls or compo&s;itions: And this was the notion that they had of the conver&s;ion of Nations, chiefly as it brought wealth and advantages to them.</P>
<P>I will conclude all that I &s;hall &s;ay in this place of the affairs of <HI>Rome</HI> with a lively &s;aying of Queen <HI>Chri&s;tina</HI> to my &s;elf <NOTE PLACE="marg">Queen <HI>Chri&s;tina</HI>'s character of &s;ome Popes.</NOTE> at <HI>Rome.</HI> She &s;aid, it was certain that the Church was govern|ed by the immediate care and providence of God: For none of the four Popes that &s;he had known &s;ince &s;he came to <HI>Rome</HI> had common &s;en&s;e. She added, they were the fir&s;t and the la&s;t of men. She had given her &s;elf entirely for &s;ome years to the &s;tudy of A&s;trology: And upon that &s;he told me, the King would live yet many years, but added that he would have no &s;on.</P>
<P>I come, from the relation of this Emba&s;&s;ade to <HI>Rome,</HI> to give an account of other negotiations. The King found, <HI>Skelton</HI> managed his affairs in <HI>Holland</HI> with &s;o little &s;en&s;e, and gave &s;uch an univer&s;al di&s;ta&s;te, that he re&s;olved to change him. But he had been &s;o &s;ervilely addicted to all his intere&s;ts, that he would not di&s;courage him. And, becau&s;e all his concerns with the Court of <HI>France</HI> were managed with <HI>Barillon</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Em|ba&s;&s;ador at <HI>London,</HI> he was &s;ent to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The King found out one <HI>White,</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;hman,</HI> who had been <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D'Albeville</HI> &s;ent Envoy to <HI>Holland.</HI></NOTE> long a &s;py of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> And when they did not pay his
<PB N="708" REF="724">
appointments well, he accepted of the title of Marquis <HI>d'Albeville</HI> from them in part of payment. And then he turned to the <HI>French,</HI> who paid their tools more punctually. But, tho' he had learned the little arts of corrupting Under-Secretaries, and had found out &s;ome &s;ecrets by that way, which made him pa&s;s for a good &s;py; yet, when he came to negotiate matters in a higher form, he proved a mo&s;t contemptible and ridiculous man, who had not the common appearances either of decency or of truth.</P>
<P>He had orders, before he entred upon bu&s;ine&s;s with the Prince <NOTE PLACE="marg">I was upon the King's pre&s;&s;ing in|&s;tances for|bid to &s;ee the Prince and Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange.</HI></NOTE> or Prince&s;s, to a&s;k of them, not only to forbid me the Court, but to promi&s;e to &s;ee me no more. The King had writ two violent letters again&s;t me to the Prince&s;s. She tru&s;ted me &s;o far, that &s;he &s;hewed them to me; and was plea&s;ed to an&s;wer them according to the hints that I &s;ugge&s;ted. But now it was put &s;o home, that this was to be complied with, or a breach was immediately to follow upon it. So this was done. And they were both &s;o true to their promi&s;e, that I &s;aw neither the one nor the other till a few days before the Prince &s;et &s;ail for <HI>England.</HI> The Prince &s;ent <HI>Dykvelt</HI> and <HI>Halewyn</HI> con&s;tantly to me, with all the adverti&s;ements that came from <HI>England.</HI> So I had the whole &s;ecret of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> affairs &s;till brought me.</P>
<P>That which was fir&s;t re&s;olved on was, to &s;end <HI>Dykvelt</HI> to <HI>England</HI> with directions how to talk with all &s;orts of people: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dykvelt</HI> &s;ent to <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> To the King, to tho&s;e of the Church, and to the Di&s;&s;enters. I was ordered to draw his in&s;tructions, which he followed very clo&s;ely. He was ordered to expo&s;tulate decently, but firmly, with the King upon the methods he was pur&s;uing, both at home and abroad; and to &s;ee, if it was po&s;&s;ible to bring him to a better under&s;tanding with the Prince. He was al&s;o to a&s;&s;ure all the Church party, that the Prince would ever be firm to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and to all our national intere&s;ts. The Clergy, by the methods in which they corre&s;ponded with him, which I &s;uppo&s;e was chiefly by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI>'s means, had de&s;ired him to u&s;e all his credit with the Di&s;&s;enters, to keep them from going into the mea&s;ures of the Court; and &s;ent over very po&s;itive a&s;&s;urances, that, in ca&s;e they &s;tood firm now to the common intere&s;t, they would in a better time come into a comprehen&s;ion of &s;uch as could be brought into a con|junction with the Church, and to a toleration of the re&s;t. They had al&s;o de&s;ired him to &s;end over &s;ome of the preachers, whom the violence of the former years had driven to <HI>Holland;</HI> and to prevail effectually with them to oppo&s;e any fal&s;e brethren, whom the Court might gain to deceive the re&s;t: Which the Prince had done. And to many of them he gave &s;uch pre&s;ents, as ena|hled
<PB N="709" REF="725">
them to pay their debts, and to undertake the journey. <HI>Dykvelt</HI> had orders to pre&s;s them all to &s;tand off; and not to be drawn in by any promi&s;es the Court might make them, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the elections of Parliament. He was al&s;o in&s;truct|ed to a&s;&s;ure them of a full toleration; and likewi&s;e of a compre|hen&s;ion, if po&s;&s;ible, when&s;oever the Crown &s;hould devolve on the Prince&s;s. He was to try all &s;orts of people, and to remove the ill characters that had been given them of the Prince: For the Church party was made believe, he was a Pre&s;byterian, and the Di&s;&s;enters were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a conceit of his being arbi|trary, and imperious. Some had even the impudence to give out, that he was a Papi&s;t. But the ill terms in which the King and he lived put an end to tho&s;e reports at that time. Yet they were afterwards taken up, and managed with much malice to create a jealou&s;y of him. <HI>Dykvelt</HI> was not gone off, when <HI>D'Albeville</HI> came to the <HI>Hague.</HI> He did all he could to divert the journey: For he knew well <HI>Dykvelt</HI>'s way of penetrating into &s;ecrets, he him&s;elf having been often employed by him, and well paid for &s;everal di&s;coveries made by his means.</P>
<P><HI>D'Albeville</HI> a&s;&s;ured the Prince and the States, that the King <NOTE PLACE="marg">The negoti|ations be|tween the King and the Prince.</NOTE> was firmly re&s;olved to maintain his alliance with them: That his naval preparations were only to enable him to pre&s;erve the peace of <HI>Europe:</HI> For he &s;eemed much concerned to find, that the States had &s;uch apprehen&s;ions of the&s;e, that they were put|ting them&s;elves in a condition not to be &s;urprized by them. In his &s;ecret negotiations with the Prince and Prince&s;s, he be|gan with very po&s;itive a&s;&s;urances, that the King intended never to wrong them in their right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: That all that the King was now engaged in was only, to a&s;&s;ert the rights of the Crown, of which they would reap the advantage in their turn: The Te&s;t was a re&s;traint on the King's liberty, and therefore he was re&s;olved to have it repealed: And he was al&s;o re&s;olved to lay a&s;ide all penal laws in matters of religion: They &s;aw too well the advantages that <HI>Holland</HI> had by the liberty of con&s;cience that was &s;ettled among them, to oppo&s;e him in this particular: The King could not abandon men, becau&s;e they were of his own religion, who had &s;erved him well, and had &s;uffered only on his account, and on the account of their con&s;cience. He told them, how much the King condemned the proceedings in <HI>France;</HI> and that he &s;poke of that King as a poor bigot, who was governed by the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Madame de Ma$|tenon,</HI> whereas he knew <HI>Pere de la Chai&s;e</HI> had oppo&s;ed the per|&s;ecution as long as he could. But the King hated tho&s;e max|ims: And therefore he received the Refugees very kindly, and
<PB N="710" REF="726">
had given orders for a collection of charity over the kingdom for their relief.</P>
<P>This was the &s;ub&s;tance, both of what <HI>D'Albeville</HI> &s;aid to the Prince and Prince&s;s, and of what the King him&s;elf &s;aid to <HI>Dykvelt</HI> upon tho&s;e &s;ubjects. At that time the King thought, he had made a majority of the Hou&s;e of Commons &s;ure: And &s;o he &s;eemed re&s;olved to have a &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament in <HI>April.</HI> And of this <HI>D'Albeville</HI> gave the Prince po&s;itive a&s;&s;urances. But the King had reckoned wrong: For many of tho&s;e, who had been with him in his clo&s;et, were either &s;ilent, or had an&s;wer|ed him in &s;uch re&s;pectful words, that he took the&s;e for pro|mi&s;es. But, when they were more &s;trictly examined, the King &s;aw his error: And &s;o the &s;itting of the Parliament was put off.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e propo&s;itions the Prince and the Prince&s;s, and <HI>Dyk|velt</HI> in their name, an&s;wered, that they were fixed in a prin|ciple again&s;t per&s;ecution in matters of con&s;cience: But they could not think it rea&s;onable to let Papi&s;ts in to &s;it in Parlia|ment, or to &s;erve in publick tru&s;ts: The re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of &s;ome of that religion, and of their Clergy in particular, &s;hewed they could not be at quiet till they were ma&s;ters: And the power they had over the King's &s;pirit, in making him forget what he had promi&s;ed upon his coming to the Crown, gave but too ju&s;t a ground of jealou&s;y: It appeared, that they could not bear any re&s;traints, nor remember pa&s;t &s;ervices longer than tho&s;e who did them could comply in every thing with that which was de&s;ired of them: They thought, the prerogative as limit|ed by law was great enough: And they de&s;ired no &s;uch exorbi|tant power as &s;hould break thro' all laws: They feared, that &s;uch an attack upon the con&s;titution might rather drive the Nation into a Commonwealth: They thought the &s;ure&s;t, as well as the be&s;t, way was, to govern according to law: The Church of <HI>England</HI> had given the King &s;ignal proofs of their affection and fidelity; and had complied with him in every thing, till he came to touch them in &s;o tender a point, as the legal &s;ecurity they had for their religion: Their &s;ticking to that was very natural: And the King's taking that ill from them was liable to great cen&s;ure: The King, if he plea&s;ed to im|prove the advantages he had in his hand, might be both ea&s;y and great at home, and the arbiter of all affairs abroad: But he was prevailed on by the importunities of &s;ome re&s;tle&s;s Prie&s;ts, to embroll all his affairs to &s;erve their ends: They could never con&s;ent to aboli&s;h tho&s;e laws, which were the be&s;t, and now the only &s;ence of that religion, which they them&s;elves believ|ed true. This was the &s;ub&s;tance of their an&s;wers to all the pre&s;|&s;ing me&s;&s;ages that were often repeated by <HI>D'Albeville.</HI> And upon
<PB N="711" REF="727">
this occa&s;ion the Prince&s;s &s;poke &s;o often and with &s;uch firm|ne&s;s to him, that he &s;aid, &s;he was more intractable on tho&s;e matters than the Prince him&s;elf. <HI>Dykvelt</HI> told me, he argued often with the King on all the&s;e topicks: But he found him ob&s;tinately fixed in his re&s;olution. He &s;aid, he was the head of the family, and the Prince ought to comply with him; but that he had always &s;et him&s;elf again&s;t him. <HI>Dykvelt</HI> an&s;wered, that the Prince could not carry his compliance &s;o far, as to give up his religion to his plea&s;ure; but that in all other things he had &s;hewed a very ready &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will: The peace of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> of which the King was guarantee, was openly violated in the article relating to the principality of <HI>Orange:</HI> Yet, &s;ince the King did not think fit to e&s;pou&s;e his intere&s;ts in that matter, he had been &s;ilent, and had made no prote&s;tati|ons upon it: So the King &s;aw, that he was ready to be &s;ilent under &s;o great an injury, and to &s;acrifice his own concerns, rather than di&s;turb the King's affairs. To this the King made no an&s;wer. The Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Mi|ni&s;try, pre&s;&s;ed <HI>Dykvelt</HI> mightily, to endeavour to bring the Prince to concur with the King. And they engaged to him, that, if that were once &s;ettled, the King would go into clo&s;e mea&s;ures with-him again&s;t <HI>France.</HI> But he put an end to all tho&s;e pro|po&s;itions. He &s;aid, the Prince could never be brought to hearken to them.</P>
<P>At this time a great di&s;covery was made of the intentions of <NOTE PLACE="marg">A letter writ by the Je&s;uits of <HI>Liege</HI> that di&s;covers the King's de&s;igns</NOTE> the Court by the Je&s;uits of <HI>Liege,</HI> who in a letter, that they wrote to their brethren in <HI>Friburg</HI> in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> gave them a long account of the affairs of <HI>England.</HI> They told them, that the King was received into a communication of the merits of their Order: That he expre&s;&s;ed great joy at his becoming a &s;on of the &s;ociety; and profe&s;&s;ed, he was as much concerned in all their intere&s;ts, as in his own: He wi&s;hed, they could furni&s;h him with many Prie&s;ts to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the conver&s;ion of the Nation, which he was re&s;olved to bring about, or to die a Martyr in endeavouring it; and that he would rather &s;uffer death for carrying on that, than live ever &s;o long and happy without attempting it. He &s;aid, he mu&s;t make ha&s;te in this work: Otherwi&s;e, if he &s;hould die before he had compa&s;&s;ed it, he would leave them wor&s;e than he found them. They added, among many particulars, that, when one of them kneeled down to ki&s;s his hand, he took him up, and &s;aid, &s;ince he was a Prie&s;t, he ought rather to kneel to him, and to ki&s;s his hand. And, when one of them was lamenting that his next heir was an heretick, he &s;aid, God would provide an heir.</P>
<P><PB N="712" REF="728">
The Je&s;uits at <HI>Friburg</HI> &s;hewed this about. And one of the Mini&s;ters, on whom they were taking &s;ome pains, and of whom they had &s;ome hopes, had got a &s;ight of it. And he obtained leave to take a copy of it, pretending that he would make good u&s;e of it. He &s;ent a copy of it to <HI>Heidegger,</HI> the famous Pro|fe&s;&s;or of Divinity at <HI>Zurich:</HI> And from him I had it. Other copies of it were likewi&s;e &s;ent, both from <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Switzer|land.</HI> One of tho&s;e was &s;ent to <HI>Dykvelt;</HI> who upon that told the King, that his Prie&s;ts had other de&s;igns, and were full of tho&s;e hopes, that gave jealou&s;ies which could not be ea&s;ily re|moved: And he named the <HI>Leige</HI> letter, and gave the King a copy of it. He promi&s;ed to him, he would read it; and he would &s;oon &s;ee, whether it was an impo&s;ture made to make them more odious, or not. But he never &s;poke of it to him after|wards. This <HI>Dykvelt</HI> thought, was a confe&s;&s;ing that the letter was no forgery. Thus <HI>Dykvelt</HI>'s negotiation at <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>D'Albeville</HI>'s at the <HI>Hague,</HI> ended without any effect on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>But, if his treating with the King was without &s;ucce&s;s, his management of his in&s;tructions was more pro&s;perous. He-de|&s;ired, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dykvelt</HI>'s conduct in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> that tho&s;e who wi&s;hed well to their religion and their country would meet together, and concert &s;uch advices and adverti&s;e|ments, as might be fit for the Prince to know, that he might govern him&s;elf by them. The Marquis of <HI>Halifax,</HI> and the Earls of <HI>Shrewsbury, Devon&s;hire, Danby,</HI> and <HI>Nottingham,</HI> the Lords <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> and <HI>Lumley, Herbert</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> among the Admirals, and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> were the per&s;ons chiefly tru&s;ted. And upon the advices that were &s;ent over by them the Prince governed all his motions. They met often at the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI>'s. And there they concerted matters, and drew the declaration on which they advi&s;ed the Prince to en|gage.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate things lay for &s;ome months. But the King re|&s;olved <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Procla|mation of indulgence &s;ent to <HI>Scot|land.</HI></NOTE> to go on in his de&s;ign of breaking thro' the laws. He &s;ent a Proclamation of indulgence to <HI>Scotland</HI> in <HI>February.</HI> It &s;et forth in the preamble, that the King had an ab&s;olute power ve&s;ted in him, &s;o that all his &s;ubjects were bound to obey him without re&s;erve: By vertue of this power, the King repealed all the &s;evere laws that were pa&s;t in his Grandfather's name during his infancy: He with that took off all di&s;abilities that were by any law laid on his Roman Catholick &s;ubjects, and made them capable of all employments and benefices: He al&s;o &s;lackned all the laws made again&s;t the moderate Pre&s;byterians: And promi&s;ed he would never force his &s;ubjects by any invin|cible nece&s;&s;ity to change their religion: And he repealed all
<PB N="713" REF="729">
laws impo&s;ing te&s;ts on tho&s;e who held any employments: In|&s;tead of which he &s;et up a new one, by which they &s;hould renounce the principles of rebellion, and &s;hould oblige them&s;elves to main|tain the King in this his ab&s;olute power again&s;t all mortals.</P>
<P>This was publi&s;hed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to make way for that which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Which was much cen|&s;ured.</NOTE> followed it &s;ome months after in <HI>England.</HI> It was &s;trangely drawn, and liable to much ju&s;t cen&s;ure. The King by this rai&s;ed his power to a pitch, not only of &s;u&s;pending, but of re|pealing laws, and of enacting new ones by his own authority. His claiming an ab&s;olute power, to which all men were bound to obey without re&s;erve, was an inva&s;ion of all that was either legal or &s;acred. The only precedent that could be found for &s;uch an extraordinary preten&s;ion, was in the declaration that <HI>Philip</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;ent by the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> into the <HI>Nether|lands,</HI> in which he founded all the authority that he commit|ted to that bloody man on the ab&s;olute power that re&s;ted in him. Yet in this the King went further than <HI>Philip,</HI> who did not pretend that the &s;ubjects were bound to obey without re|&s;erve. Every Prince that believes the truth of religion mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, that there are re&s;erves in the obedience of their &s;ubjects, in ca&s;e their commands &s;hould be contrary to the laws of God. The requiring all per&s;ons that &s;hould be capable of employ|ments to &s;wear to maintain this, was to make them feel their &s;lavery too &s;en&s;ibly. The King's promi&s;ing to u&s;e <HI>no invincible nece&s;&s;ity</HI> to force his &s;ubjects to change their religion, &s;hewed that he allowed him&s;elf a very large re&s;erve in this grace that he promi&s;ed his &s;ubjects; tho' he allowed them none in their obedience. The laws that had pa&s;&s;ed during King <HI>James</HI>'s mi|nority had been often ratified by him&s;elf after he was of age. And they had received many &s;ub&s;equent confirmations in the &s;ucceeding reigns; and one in the King's own reign. And the te&s;t that was now taken away was pa&s;t by the pre&s;ent King, when he repre&s;ented his brother. Some took al&s;o notice of the word <HI>moderate Presbyterians,</HI> as very ambiguous.</P>
<P>The Court finding that &s;o many objections lay again&s;t this Proclamation, (as indeed it &s;eemed penned on purpo&s;e to rai&s;e new jealou&s;ies,) let it fall; and &s;ent down another &s;ome months af|ter that more cautiou&s;ly worded; only ab&s;olute power was &s;o dear to them, that it was &s;till a&s;&s;erted in the new one. By it, full liberty was granted to all Pre&s;byterians to &s;et up Conven|ticles in their own way. They did all accept of it without pretending any &s;cruples. And they magnified this, as an extra|ordinary &s;troke of Providence, that a Prince, from whom they expected an encrea&s;e of the &s;everities under which the laws had brought them, &s;hould thus of a &s;udden allow them &s;uch an un|confined
<PB N="714" REF="730">
liberty. But they were not &s;o blind, as not to &s;ee what was aimed at by it. They made addre&s;&s;es upon it full of ac|knowledgements, and of prote&s;tations of loyalty. Yet, when &s;ome were &s;ent among them, pre&s;&s;ing them to di&s;po&s;e all their party to concur with the King in taking away the te&s;ts and penal laws, they an&s;wered them only in cold and general words.</P>
<P>In <HI>April</HI> the King &s;et out a declaration of toleration and li|berty <NOTE PLACE="marg">A declarati|on for tole|ration in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> of con&s;cience for <HI>England.</HI> But it was drawn up in much more mode&s;t terms, than the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Proclamation had been. In the preamble, the King expre&s;&s;ed his aver&s;ion to per&s;ecution on the account of religion, and the nece&s;&s;ity that he found of allow|ing his &s;ubjects liberty of con&s;cience, in which he did not doubt of the concurrence of his Parliament: He renewed his promi&s;e of maintaining the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as it was by law e&s;tabli&s;hed: But with this he &s;u&s;pended all penal and &s;an|guinary laws in matters of religion: And, &s;ince the &s;ervice of all his &s;ubjects was due to him by the laws of nature, he declared them all equally capable of employments, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all oaths or te&s;ts that limited this: In conclu&s;ion, he promi&s;ed he would maintain all his &s;ubjects in all their properties, and particularly in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Abbey lands.</P>
<P>This gave great offence to all true patriots, as well as to the whole Church party. The King did now a&s;&s;ume a power of repealing laws by his own authority: For tho' he pretended on|ly to &s;u&s;pend them, yet no limitation was &s;et to this &s;u&s;pen&s;i|on: So it amounted to a repeal, the laws being &s;u&s;pended for all time to come. The preamble, that pretended &s;o much love and charity, and that condemned per&s;ecution, &s;ounded &s;trangely in the mouth of a Popi&s;h Prince. The King's &s;aying that he did not doubt of the Parliament's concurring with him in this mat|ter &s;eemed ridiculous: For it was vi&s;ible by all the prorogations, that the King was but too well a&s;&s;ured, that the Parliament would not concur with him in it. And the promi&s;e to maintain the &s;ubjects in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Abbey lands, looked as if the de&s;ign of &s;etting up Popery was thought very near being effect|ed, &s;ince otherwi&s;e there was no need of mentioning any &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>Upon this a new &s;et of addre&s;&s;es went round the Diffenters. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Addre&s;&s;es made upon it.</NOTE> And they, who had &s;o long reproached the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as too courtly in their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions and flatteries, &s;eemed now to vie with them in tho&s;e abject &s;trains. Some of them, being penned by per&s;ons whom the Court had gained, contained &s;e|vere reflections on the Clergy, and on their proceedings. They magnified the King's mercy and favour, and made great pro|te&s;tations of fidelity and gratitude. Many promi&s;ed to endea|vour,
<PB N="715" REF="731">
that &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hould be cho&s;en to &s;erve in Parlia|ment, as &s;hould concur with the King in the enacting what he now granted &s;o graciou&s;ly. Few concurred in tho&s;e addre&s;&s;es: And the per&s;ons that brought them up were mean and incon|&s;iderable. Yet the Court was lifted up with this. The King and his Prie&s;ts were delighted with the&s;e addre&s;&s;es out of mea|&s;ure: And they &s;eemed to think that they had gained the Na|tion, and had now conquered tho&s;e who were hitherto their mo&s;t irreconcilable enemies. The King made the cruelty of the Church of <HI>England</HI> the common &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e. He reproached them for &s;etting on &s;o often a violent per&s;ecution of the Di&s;|&s;enters. He &s;aid, he had intended to have &s;et on this tolerati|on &s;ooner; but that he was re&s;trained by &s;ome of them, who had treated with him, and had undertaken to &s;hew favour to tho&s;e of his religion, provided they might be &s;till &s;uffered to vex the Di&s;&s;enters. He named the per&s;ons that had made tho&s;e propo&s;itions to him. In which he &s;uffered much in his honour: For as the per&s;ons denied the whole thing, &s;o the freedom of di&s;cour&s;e in any &s;uch treaty ought not to have been made u&s;e of to defame them.</P>
<P>But, to carry this further, and to give a publick and an odious <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's indignation again&s;t the Church par|ty.</NOTE> proof of the rigour of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts, the King or|dered an enquiry to be made into all the vexatious &s;uits into which Di&s;&s;enters had been brought in the&s;e Courts, and into all the compo&s;itions that they had been forced to make to re|deem them&s;elves from further trouble; which, as was &s;aid, would have brought a &s;candalous di&s;covery of all the ill prac|tices of tho&s;e Courts. For the u&s;e that many that belonged to them had made of the laws with relation to the Di&s;&s;enters, was, to draw pre&s;ents from &s;uch of them as could make them; threat|ning them with a proce&s;s in ca&s;e they failed to do that, and upon their doing it leaving them at full liberty to neglect the laws as much as they plea&s;ed. It was hoped at Court, that this fury again&s;t the Church would have animated the Di&s;&s;en|ters to turn upon the Clergy with &s;ome of that fiercene&s;s, with which they them&s;elves had been lately treated. Some few of the hotter of the Di&s;&s;enters an&s;wered their expectations. Angry &s;peeches and virulent books were publi&s;hed. Yet the&s;e were di&s;|owned by the wi&s;er men among them: And the Clergy, by a ge|neral agreement, made no an&s;wer to them. So that the matter was let fall, to the great grief of the Popi&s;h party. Some of the Bi&s;hops, that were gained by the Court, carried their com|pliance to a &s;hameful pitch: For they &s;et on addre&s;&s;es of thanks to the King for the promi&s;e he had made in the late declara|tion of maintaining the Church of <HI>England;</HI> tho' it was vi&s;ible
<PB N="716" REF="732">
that the intent of it was to de&s;troy the Church. Some few were drawn into this. But the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Oxford</HI> had &s;o ill &s;ucce&s;s in his Dioce&s;e, that he got but one &s;ingle Clergyman to con|cur with him in it. Some fooli&s;h men retained &s;till their old peevi&s;hne&s;s. But the far greater part of the Clergy began to open their eyes, and &s;ee how they had been engaged by ill meaning men, who were now laying off the ma&s;k, into all the fury that had been driven on for many years by a Popi&s;h par|ty. And it was often &s;aid, that, if ever God &s;hould deliver them out of the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, they would keep up their do|me&s;tick quarrels no more, which were &s;o vi&s;ibly and &s;o art|fully managed by our enemies to make us devour one another, and &s;o in the end to be con&s;umed one of another. And when &s;ome of tho&s;e who had been always moderate told the&s;e, who were putting on another temper, that they would perhaps for|get this as &s;oon as the danger was over, they promi&s;ed the contrary very &s;olemnly. It &s;hall be told afterwards, how well they remembred this. Now the Bed-chamber and Drawing-room were as full of &s;tories to the prejudice of the Clergy, as they were formerly to the prejudice of the Di&s;&s;enters. It was &s;aid, they had been loyal as long as the Court was in their intere&s;ts, and was venturing all on their account; but as &s;oon as this chang|ed, they changed likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>The King, &s;eeing no hope of prevailing on his Parliament, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Parlia|ment was di&s;&s;olved.</NOTE> di&s;&s;olved it; but gave it out, that he would have a new one before winter. And, the Queen being advi&s;ed to go to the <HI>Bath</HI> for her health, the King re&s;olved on a great progre&s;s thro' &s;ome of the We&s;tern Counties.</P>
<P>Before he &s;et out, he re&s;olved to give the Pope's Nuntio a <NOTE PLACE="marg">The recep|tion of the Pope's Nunno.</NOTE> &s;olemn reception at <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI> He apprehended &s;ome di&s;order might have happen'd, if it had been done at <HI>London.</HI> He thought it below both his own dignity and the Pope's, not to give the Nuntio a publick audience. This was a hard point for tho&s;e who were to act a part in this ceremony; for, all commerce with the See of <HI>Rome</HI> being declared high trea&s;on by law, this was believed to fall within the &s;tatute. It was &s;o apprehended by Queen <HI>Mary.</HI> Cardinal <HI>Pool</HI> was obliged to &s;tay in <HI>Flanders</HI> till all tho&s;e laws were repealed. But the King would not &s;tay for that. The Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> being the Lord of the Bed-chamber then in waiting, had advi&s;ed with his lawyers: And they told him, he could not &s;afely do the part that was expected of him in the audience. So he told the King, that he could not &s;erve him upon that occa&s;ion; for he was a&s;&s;ured it was again&s;t the law. The King a&s;ked him, if he did not know that he was above the law. The other an&s;wered, that, whatever the King
<PB N="717" REF="733">
might be, he him&s;elf was not above the law. The King ex|pre&s;&s;ed a high di&s;plea&s;ure, and turned him out of all employ|ments. The ceremony pa&s;t very heavily: And the compliment was pronounced with &s;o low a voice, that no per&s;on could hear it; which was believed done by concert.</P>
<P>When this was over, the King &s;et out for his progre&s;s, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King made a pro|gre&s;s $word$ many parts of <HI>England</HI></NOTE> went from <HI>Salisbury</HI> all round as far as to <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> In the places thro' which the King pa&s;t, he &s;aw a vi&s;ible coldne&s;s both in the Nobility and Gentry, which was not ea&s;ily born by a man of his temper. In many places they pretended occa&s;ions to go out of their countries. Some &s;taid at home. And tho&s;e who waited on the King &s;eemed to do it rather out of duty and re|&s;pect, than with any cordial affection. The King on his part was very obliging to all that came near him, and mo&s;t parti|cularly to the Di&s;&s;enters, and to tho&s;e who had pa&s;&s;ed long un|der the notion of Common wealth's men. He looked very gra|ciou&s;ly on all that had been of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s party. He addre&s;&s;ed his di&s;cour&s;e generally to all &s;orts of people. He ran out on the point of liberty of con&s;cience: He &s;aid, this was the true &s;ecret of the greatne&s;s and wealth of <HI>Holland.</HI> He was well plea&s;ed to hear all the ill natured &s;tories that were brought him of the violences committed of late, either by the Ju&s;tices of Peace, or by the Clergy. He every where recommend|ed to them the choo&s;ing &s;uch Parliament men, as would con|cur with him in &s;ettling this liberty as firmly as the <HI>Magna Charta</HI> had been: And to this he never forgot to add the taking away the Te&s;ts. But he received &s;uch cold and general an&s;wers, that he &s;aw, he could not depend on them. The King had de&s;igned to go thro' many more places: But the &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s he had in tho&s;e which he vi&s;ited made him &s;horten his progre&s;s. He went and vi&s;ited the Queen at the <HI>Bath,</HI> where he &s;taid only a few days, two or three at mo&s;t: And &s;he con|tinued on in her cour&s;e of bathing. Many books were now writ for liberty of con&s;cience: And, &s;ince all people &s;aw what &s;e|curity the Te&s;ts gave, the&s;e &s;poke of an equivalent to be offer|ed, that &s;hould give a further &s;ecurity, beyond what could be pretended from the Te&s;ts. It was never explained what was meant by this: So it was thought an artificial method to lay men a&s;leep with a high &s;ounding word. Some talked of new laws to &s;ecure civil liberty, which had been &s;o much &s;haken by the practices of the&s;e la&s;t years, ever &s;ince the <HI>Oxford</HI> Parliament. Upon this a very extravagant thing was given out, that the King was re&s;olved to &s;et up a &s;ort of a Commonwealth: And the Papi&s;ts began to talk every where very high for publick li|berty, trying by that to recommend them&s;elves to the Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="718" REF="734">
When the King came back from his progre&s;s, he re&s;olved to change the Magi&s;tracy in mo&s;t of the Cities of <HI>England.</HI> He began with <HI>London.</HI> He not only changed the Court of Alder|men, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A change of the Magi&s;tra|cy in <HI>London,</HI> and over <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> but the government of many of the companies of the City: For great powers had been re&s;erved in the new Charters that had been given, for the King to put in and to put out at plea&s;ure: But it was &s;aid at the granting them, that the&s;e clau&s;es were put in only to keep them in a due depen|dance on the Court, but that they &s;hould not be made u&s;e of, unle&s;s great provocation was given. Now all this was executed with great &s;everity and contempt. Tho&s;e, who had &s;tood up for the King during the debates about the Exclu&s;ion, were now turned out with di&s;grace: And tho&s;e who had appeared mo&s;t violently again&s;t him were put in the Magi&s;tracy, who took liberties now in their turn to in&s;ult their neighbours. All this turned upon the King, who was &s;o given up to the humours of his Prie&s;ts, that he &s;acrificed both his honour and gratitude as they dic|tated. The new men, who were brought in, &s;aw this too vi&s;i|bly to be much wrought on by it.</P>
<P>The King threw off his old party in too outrageous a man|ner ever to return to them again. But he was much &s;urpri&s;ed to find that the new Mayor and Aldermen took the Te&s;t, and or|dered the ob&s;ervation of Gunpowder-trea&s;on day to be conti|nued. When the Sheriffs came according to cu&s;tom to invite the King to the Lord Mayor's fea&s;t, he commanded them to go and invite the Nuntio; which they did. And he went upon the invitation, to the &s;urprize of all who &s;aw it. But the Mayor and Aldermen di&s;owned the invitation; and made an entry of it in their books, that the Nuntio came without their know|ledge. This the King took very ill. And upon it he &s;aid, he &s;aw the Di&s;&s;enters were an ill natured &s;ort of people, that could not be gained. The King &s;ignified to the Lord Mayor, that he might u&s;e what form of wor&s;hip he liked be&s;t in <HI>Guildhall</HI> Chapel. The de&s;ign in this was to engage the Di&s;&s;enters to make the fir&s;t change from the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip: And, if a Pre&s;byterian Mayor &s;hould do this in one year, a Popi&s;h Mayor might do it in another. But the Mayor put the deci&s;ion of this upon per&s;ons again&s;t whom the Court could have no ex|ception. He &s;ent to tho&s;e, to whom the governing of the Dio|ce&s;e of <HI>London</HI> was committed during the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, and a&s;ked their opinion in it; which they could not but give in behalf of the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip: And they added, that the chang|ing it was again&s;t law. So this project mi&s;carried: And the Mayor, tho' he went &s;ometimes to the meetings of the Di&s;&s;enters, yet
<PB N="719" REF="735">
he came often to Church, and behaved him&s;elf more decently than was expected of him.</P>
<P>This change in the City not &s;ucceeding as the Court had expected, did not di&s;courage them from appointing a Committee to examine the Magi&s;tracy in the other Cities, and to put in or out as they &s;aw cau&s;e for it. Some were putting the Nation in hope, that the old Charters were to be re&s;tored. But the King was &s;o far from that, that he was making every day a very arbitrary u&s;e of the power of changing the Magi&s;tracy, that was re&s;erved in the new Charters. The&s;e Regulators, who were for mo&s;t part Di&s;&s;enters gained by the Court, went on very boldly; and turned men out upon every &s;tory that was made of them, and put &s;uch men in their room as they confided in. And in the&s;e they took their mea&s;ures often &s;o ha&s;tily, that men were put in in one week, and turned out in another.</P>
<P>After this the King &s;ent orders to the Lords Lieutenants of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Que&s;tions put about e|lections of Parliament.</NOTE> the Counties, to examine the Gentlemen and Freeholders upon three que&s;tions. The fir&s;t was, whether, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be cho&s;en to &s;erve in Parliament, they would con&s;ent to repeal the pe|nal laws, and tho&s;e for the Te&s;ts. The &s;econd was, whether they would give their vote for choo&s;ing &s;uch men as would engage to do that. And the third was, whether they would maintain the King's declaration. In mo&s;t of the Counties the Lords Lieutenants put tho&s;e que&s;tions in &s;o carele&s;s a manner, that it was plain they did not de&s;ire they &s;hould be an&s;wered in the affirmative. Some went further, and declared them&s;elves again&s;t them. And a few of the more re&s;olute refu&s;ed to put them. They &s;aid, this was the preli|miting, and the packing of a Parliament, which in its nature was to be free, and under no previous engagement. Many Counties an&s;wered very boldly in the negative: And others refu&s;ed to give any an&s;wer, which was under&s;tood to be equivalent to a negative. The Mayor and mo&s;t of the new Aldermen of <HI>London</HI> refu&s;ed to an&s;wer. Upon this many were turned out of all Commi&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>This, as all the other artifices of the Prie&s;ts, had an effect quite contrary to what they promi&s;ed them&s;elves from it: For tho&s;e who had re&s;olved to oppo&s;e the Court were more en|couraged than ever, by the di&s;covery now made of the &s;en&s;e of the whole Nation in tho&s;e matters. Yet &s;uch care was taken in naming the Sheriffs and Mayors that were appointed for the next year, that it was believed that the King was re&s;olved to hold a Parliament within that time, and to have &s;uch a Hou&s;e of Commons returned, whether regularly cho&s;en, or not, as &s;hould &s;erve his ends.</P>
<P><PB N="720" REF="736">
It was concluded, that the King would make u&s;e both of his power and of his troops, either to force elections, or to put the Parliament under a force when it &s;hould meet: For it was &s;o po&s;itively &s;aid, that the King would carry his point, and there was &s;o little appearance of his being able to do it in a fair and regular way, that it was generally believed, &s;ome very de&s;perate re&s;olution was now taken up. His Mini&s;ters were now &s;o deeply engaged in illegal things, that they were very unea&s;y, and were endeavouring either to carry on his de&s;igns with &s;uc|ce&s;s, &s;o as to get all &s;ettled in a body that &s;hould carry the face and appearance of a Parliament, or at lea&s;t to bring him to let all fall, and to come into terms of agreement with his people; in which ca&s;e, they reckoned, one article would be an indemnity for all that had been done.</P>
<P>The King was every day &s;aying, that he was King, and he would be obeyed, and would make tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed him feel that he was their King: And he had both Prie&s;ts and flatterers about him, that were &s;till pu&s;hing him forward. All men grew melancholly with this &s;ad pro&s;pect. The hope of the true Prote&s;|tants was in the King's two daughters; chiefly on the elde&s;t, who was out of his reach, and was known to be well in&s;tructed, and very zealous in matters of religion. The Prince&s;s <HI>Anne</HI> was &s;till very &s;tedfa&s;t and regular in her devotions, and was very exemplary in the cour&s;e of her life. But, as care had been taken to put very ordinary Divines about her for her Chaplains, &s;o &s;he had never pur&s;ued any &s;tudy in tho&s;e points with much ap|plication. And, all her Court being put about her by the King and Queen, &s;he was be&s;et with &s;pies. It was therefore much apprehended, that &s;he would be &s;trongly a&s;&s;aulted, when all other de&s;igns &s;hould &s;o far &s;ucceed as to make that &s;ea&s;onable. In the mean while &s;he was let alone by the King, who was in|deed a very kind and indulgent Father to her. Now he re|&s;olved to make his fir&s;t attack on the Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange. D'Al|beville</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$ wrote to the Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange</HI> a|bout religi+on.</NOTE> went over to <HI>England</HI> in the &s;ummer, and did not come back before the twenty fourth of <HI>December, Chri&s;tmas</HI> Eve. And then he gave the Prince&s;s a letter from the King, bearing date the fourth of <HI>November.</HI> He was to carry this letter: And his di&s;patches being put off longer than was intended, that made this letter came &s;o late to her.</P>
<P>The King took the ri&s;e of his letter from a que&s;tion &s;he had put to <HI>D'Albeville,</HI> de&s;iring to know what were the grounds upon which the King him&s;elf had changed his religion. The King told her, he was bred up in the doctrine of the Church of <HI>England</HI> by Dr. <HI>Stewart,</HI> whom the King his father had put about him; in which he was &s;o zealous, that when he perceived the Queen
<PB N="721" REF="737">
his Mother had a de&s;ign upon the Duke of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> tho' he pre&s;erved &s;till the re&s;pect that he owed her, yet he took care to prevent it. All the while that he was beyond &s;ea, no Ca|tholick, but one Nun, had ever &s;poken one word to per&s;uade him to change his religion: And he continued for the mo&s;t part of that time firm to the doctrine of the Church of <HI>Eng|land.</HI> He did not then mind tho&s;e matters much: And, as all young people are apt to do, he thought it a point of honour not to change his religion. The fir&s;t thing that rai&s;ed &s;cru|ples in him was, the great devotion that he had ob&s;erved among Catholicks: He &s;aw they had great helps for it: They had their Churches better adorned, and did greater acts of charity, than he had ever &s;een among Prote&s;tants. He al&s;o ob&s;erved, that many of them changed their cour&s;e of life, and became good Chri&s;tians, even tho' they continued to live &s;till in the world. This made him fir&s;t begin to examine both religions. He could &s;ee nothing in the three reigns in which religion was changed in <HI>England,</HI> to incline him to believe that they who did it were &s;ent of God. He read the hi&s;tory of that time, as it was writ in the Chronicle. He read both Dr. <HI>Heylin,</HI> and <HI>Hooker</HI>'s preface to his Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Policy, which confirmed him in the &s;ame opinion. He &s;aw clearly, that Chri&s;t had left an infallibility in his Church, again&s;t which <HI>the gates of Hell cannot prevail:</HI> And it appeared that this was lodged with St. <HI>Peter</HI> from our Saviour's words to him, St. <HI>Mat.</HI> xvi. ver. 18. Upon this the certainty of the Scriptures, and even of Chri&s;ti|anity it &s;elf, was founded. The Apo&s;tles acknowledged this to be in St. <HI>Peter, Acts</HI> xv. when they &s;aid, <HI>It &s;eemed good to the Holy Gho&s;t and to us.</HI> It was the authority of the Church that declared the Scriptures to be Canonical: And certainly they who declared them could only interpret them: And where-ever this infallibility was, there mu&s;t be a clear &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The point of the infallibility being once &s;ettled, all other controver&s;ies mu&s;t needs fall. Now the <HI>Roman</HI> Church was the only Church that either has infallibility, or that pretended to it. And they who threw off this authority did open a door to Athei&s;m and Infi|delity, and took people off from true devotion, and &s;et even Chri&s;tianity it &s;elf loo&s;e to all that would que&s;tion it, and to Socinians and Latitudinarians who doubted of every thing. He had di&s;cour&s;ed of the&s;e things with &s;ome Divines of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> but had received no &s;atisfaction from them. The Chri&s;tian Religion gained its credit by the miracles which the Apo&s;tles wrought, and by the holy lives and &s;ufferings of the Martyrs, who&s;e blood was the &s;eed of the Church. Whereas <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Calvin,</HI> and tho&s;e who had &s;et up the Church of
<PB N="722" REF="738">
<HI>England,</HI> had their heads fuller of temporal matters than of &s;pi|ritual, and had let the world loo&s;e to great di&s;orders. Submi&s;|&s;ion was nece&s;&s;ary to the peace of the Church: And when every man will expound the Scriptures, this makes way to all &s;ects, who pretend to build upon it. It was al&s;o plain, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> did not pretend to infallibility: Yet &s;he acted as if &s;he did: For ever &s;ince the Reformation &s;he had per&s;ecut|ed tho&s;e who differed from her, Di&s;&s;enters as well as Papi&s;ts, more than was generally known. And he could not &s;ee why Di&s;&s;enters might not &s;eparate from the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as well as &s;he had done from the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> Nor could the Church of <HI>England</HI> &s;eparate her &s;elf from the Catholick Church, any more than a County of <HI>England</HI> could &s;eparate it &s;elf from the re&s;t of the Kingdom. This, he &s;aid, was all that his lei&s;ure allowed him to write. But he thought that the&s;e things, together with the King his brother's papers, and the Duche&s;s's papers, might &s;erve, if not to ju&s;tify the Catholick Religion to an unbia&s;&s;ed judgment, yet at lea&s;t to create a fa|vourable opinion of it.</P>
<P>I read this letter in the original: For the Prince &s;ent it to me together with the Prince&s;s's an&s;wer, but with a charge not to take a copy of either, but to read them over as often as I plea&s;ed; which I did till I had fixed both pretty well in my me|mory. And, as &s;oon as I had &s;ent them back, I &s;at down im|mediately to write out all that I remembred, which the Prince&s;s owned to me afterwards, when &s;he read the ab&s;tracts I made, were punctual almo&s;t to a tittle. It was ea&s;y for me to believe that this letter was all the King's enditing; for I had heard it almo&s;t in the very &s;ame words from his own mouth. The letter was writ very decently, and concluded very mode&s;tly. The Prince&s;s received this letter, as was told me, on the twenty fourth of <HI>December</HI> at night. Next day being <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> day, &s;he received the Sacrament, and was during the greate&s;t part of the day in publick devotions: Yet &s;he found time to draw fir&s;t an an&s;wer, and then to write it out fair: And &s;he &s;ent it by the po&s;t on the twenty &s;ixth of <HI>December.</HI> Her draught, which the Prince &s;ent me, was very little blotted or altered. It was long, about two &s;heets of paper: For as an an|&s;wer runs generally out into more length than the paper that is to be an&s;wered, &s;o the &s;trains of re&s;pect, with which her letter was full, drew it out to a greater length.</P>
<P>She began with an&s;wering another letter that &s;he had received <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> by the po&s;t; in which the King had made an excu&s;e for fail|ing to write the former po&s;t day. She was very &s;en&s;ible of the happine&s;s of hearing &s;o con&s;tantly from him: For no difference
<PB N="723" REF="739">
in religion could hinder her from de&s;iring both his ble&s;&s;ing and his prayers, tho' &s;he was ever &s;o far from him. As for the paper that <HI>M. Albeville</HI> delivered her, he told her, that his Ma|je&s;ty would not be offended, if &s;he wrote her thoughts freely to him upon it.</P>
<P>She hoped, he would not look on that as want of re&s;pect in her. She was far from &s;ticking to the religion in which &s;he was bred out of a point of honour; for &s;he had taken much pains to be &s;ettled in it upon better grounds. Tho&s;e of the Church of <HI>England</HI> who had in&s;tructed her, had freely laid be|fore her that which was good in the Romi&s;h Religion, that &s;o, &s;eeing the good and the bad of both, &s;he might judge impar|tially; according to the Apo&s;tle's rule of <HI>proving all things, and holding fa&s;t that which was good.</HI> Tho' &s;he had come young out of <HI>England,</HI> yet &s;he had not left behind her either the de|&s;ire of being well informed, or the means for it. She had fur|ni&s;hed her &s;elf with books, and had tho&s;e about her who might clear any doubts to her. She &s;aw clearly in the Scriptures, that &s;he mu&s;t work her own &s;alvation with fear and trembling, and that &s;he mu&s;t not believe by the faith of another, but ac|cording as things appeared to her &s;elf. It ought to be no pre|judice again&s;t the Reformation, if many of tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed it led ill lives. If any of them lived ill, none of the princi|ples of their religion allowed them in it. Many of them led good lives, and more might do it by the grace of God. But there were many devotions in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> on which the Reformed could &s;et no value.</P>
<P>She acknowledged, that, if there was an infallibility in the Church, all other controver&s;ies mu&s;t fall to the ground. But &s;he could never yet be informed where that infallibility was lodged: Whether in the Pope alone, or in a General Council, or in both. And &s;he de&s;ired to know in whom the infallibility re&s;ted, when there were two or three Popes at a time, acting one again&s;t another, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Councils, which they called General: And at lea&s;t the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was then much di&s;|ordered. As for the authority that is pretended to have been given to St. <HI>Peter</HI> over the re&s;t, that place which was chiefly alledg|ed for it was otherwi&s;e interpreted by tho&s;e of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as importing only the confirmation of him in the of|fice of an Apo&s;tle, when in an&s;wer to that que&s;tion, <HI>Simon, &s;on of</HI> Jonas, <HI>love&s;t thou me,</HI> he had by a triple confe&s;&s;ion wa&s;hed off his triple denial. The words that the King had cited were &s;poken to the other Apo&s;tles, as well as to him. It was agreed by all, that the Apo&s;tles were infallible, who were guided by God's holy Spirit. But that gift, as well as many others, had
<PB N="724" REF="740">
cea&s;ed long ago. Yet in that St. <HI>Peter</HI> had no authority over the other Apo&s;tles: Otherwi&s;e St. <HI>Paul</HI> under&s;tood our Saviour's words ill, who <HI>with&s;tood him to his face, becau&s;e he was to be blamed.</HI> And if St. <HI>Peter</HI> him&s;elf could not maintain that autho|rity, &s;he could not &s;ee how it could be given to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who&s;e bad lives agreed ill with his doctrine.</P>
<P>Nor did &s;he &s;ee, why the ill u&s;e that &s;ome made of the Scrip|tures ought to deprive others of them. It is true, all &s;ects made u&s;e of them, and find &s;omewhat in them that they draw in to &s;upport their opinions: Yet for all this our Saviour &s;aid to the <HI>Jews, &s;earch the Scriptures;</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> ordered his epi&s;tles to be read to all the Saints in the Churches; and he &s;ays in one place, <HI>I write as to wi&s;emen, judge what I &s;ay.</HI> And if they might judge an Apo&s;tle, much more any other teacher. Un|der the law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the Old Te&s;tament was to be read, not only in the hearing of the Scribes and the Doctors of the law&punc; but likewi&s;e in the hearing of the women and children. And &s;ince God had made us rea&s;onable creatures, it &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to employ our rea&s;ons chiefly in the matters of the greate&s;t con|cern. Tho' faith was above our rea&s;on, yet it propo&s;ed nothing to us that was contradictory to it. Every one ought to &s;atisfy him&s;elf in the&s;e things: As our Saviour convinced <HI>Thomas,</HI> by making him to thru&s;t his own hand into the print of the nails, not leaving him to the te&s;timony of the other Apo&s;tles, who were already convinced. She was confident, that, if the King would hear many of his own &s;ubjects, they would fully &s;atisfy him as to all tho&s;e prejudices, that he had at the Reformation; in which nothing was acted tumultuou&s;ly, but all was done ac|cording to law. The de&s;ign of it was only, to &s;eparate from the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, in &s;o far as it had &s;eparated from the pri|mitive Church: In which they had brought things to as great a degree of perfection, as tho&s;e corrupt ages were capable of. She did not &s;ee, how the Church of <HI>England</HI> could be blamed for the per&s;ecution of the Di&s;&s;enters: For the laws made again&s;t them were made by the State, and not by the Church: And they were made for crimes again&s;t the State. Their enemies had taken great care to foment the divi&s;ion, in which they had been but too &s;ucce&s;sful. But, if he would reflect on the grounds up|on which the Church of <HI>England</HI> had &s;eparated from the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> he would find them to be of a very different nature from tho&s;e for which the Di&s;&s;enters had left it.</P>
<P>Thus, &s;he concluded, &s;he gave him the trouble of a long account of the grounds upon which &s;he was per&s;uaded of the truth of her religion: In which &s;he was &s;o fully &s;atisfied, that &s;he tru&s;ted by the grace of God that &s;he &s;hould &s;pend the re&s;t
<PB N="725" REF="741">
of her days in it: And &s;he was &s;o well a&s;&s;ured of the truth of our Saviour's words, that &s;he was confident the gates of hell &s;hould not prevail again&s;t it, but that he would be with it to the end of the world. All ended thus, that the religion which &s;he pro|fe&s;&s;ed taught her her duty to him, &s;o that &s;he &s;hould ever be his mo&s;t obedient daughter and &s;ervant.</P>
<P>To this the next return of the po&s;t brought an an&s;wer from the King, which I &s;aw not. But the account that was &s;ent me of it was: The King took notice of the great progre&s;s he &s;aw the Prince&s;s had made in her enquiries after tho&s;e matters: The King's bu&s;ine&s;s did not allow him the time that was nece&s;&s;ary to enter into the detail of her letter: He de&s;ired, &s;he would read tho&s;e books that he had mentioned to her in his former letters, and &s;ome others that he intended to &s;end her: And, if &s;he de&s;ired to be more fully &s;atisfied, he propo&s;ed to her to di&s;cour&s;e about them with <HI>F. Morgan,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Je&s;uit then at the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;et down very minutely every particular that was in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on the&s;e let|ters.</NOTE> tho&s;e letters, and very near in the &s;ame words. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that per&s;ons of this Quality &s;eldom enter into &s;uch a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The King's letter contained a &s;tudied account of the change of his religion, which he had repeated often: And it was perhaps prepared for him by &s;ome others. There were &s;ome things in it, which, if he had made a little more re|flection on them, it may be &s;uppo&s;ed he would not have mentioned. The cour&s;e of his own life was not &s;o &s;trict, as to make it likely that the good lives of &s;ome Papi&s;ts had made &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions upon him. The ea&s;y ab&s;olutions that are grant|ed in that Church are a much ju&s;ter prejudice in this re&s;pect again&s;t it, than the good lives of a few can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be an argument for it. The adorning their Churches, was a re|flection that did no great honour to him that made it. The &s;everities u&s;ed by the Church of <HI>England</HI> again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters were urged with a very ill grace by one of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that has delighted her &s;elf &s;o often by being, as it were, bathed with the blood of tho&s;e they call hereticks: And, if it had not been for the re&s;pect that a daughter paid her father, here greater advantages might have been taken. I had a high opinion of the Prince&s;s's good under&s;tanding, and of her knowledge in tho&s;e matters, before I &s;aw this letter: But this &s;urprized me. It gave me an a&s;toni&s;hing joy, to &s;ee &s;o young a per&s;on all of the &s;udden, without con&s;ulting any one per&s;on, to be able to write &s;o &s;olid and learned a letter, in which &s;he mixed with the re&s;pect that &s;he paid a father &s;o great a firmne&s;s, that by it the cut off all further treaty. And her repul&s;ing the attack, that the
<PB N="726" REF="742">
King made upon her, with &s;o much re&s;olution and force, did let the Popi&s;h party &s;ee, that &s;he under&s;tood her religion as well as &s;he loved it.</P>
<P>But now I mu&s;t &s;ay &s;omewhat of my &s;elf: After I had &s;taid a year in <HI>Holland,</HI> I heard from many hands, that the King <NOTE PLACE="marg">A pro&s;ecuti|on &s;et on a|gain&s;t me.</NOTE> &s;eemed to forget his own greatne&s;s when he &s;poke of me, which he took occa&s;ion to do very often. I had publi&s;hed &s;ome ac|count of the &s;hort <HI>Tour</HI> I had made in &s;everal letters; in which my chief de&s;ign was to expo&s;e both Popery and Tyranny. The book was well received, and was much read: And it rai&s;ed the King's di&s;plea&s;ure very high.</P>
<P>My continuing at the <HI>Hague</HI> made him conclude, that I was managing de&s;igns again&s;t him. And &s;ome papers in &s;ingle &s;heets came out, reflecting on the proceedings of <HI>England,</HI> which &s;eem|ed to have a con&s;iderable effect on tho&s;e who read them. The&s;e were printed in <HI>Holland:</HI> And many copies of them were &s;ent into all the parts of <HI>England.</HI> All which inflamed the King the more again&s;t me; for he believed they were writ by me, as indeed mo&s;t of them were. But that which gave the cri&s;is to the King's anger was, that he heard I was to be married to a con&s;idera|ble fortune at the <HI>Hague.</HI> So a project was formed to break this, by charging me with high trea&s;on for corre&s;ponding with Lord <HI>Argile,</HI> and for conver&s;ing with &s;ome that were outlawed for high trea&s;on.</P>
<P>The King ordered a letter to be writ in his name to his Ad|vocate in <HI>Scotland</HI> to pro&s;ecute me for &s;ome probable thing or other; which was intended only to make a noi&s;e, not doubt|ing but this would break the intended marriage. A &s;hip com|ing from <HI>Scotland</HI> the day in which this pro&s;ecution was or|dered, that had a quick pa&s;&s;age, brought me the fir&s;t news of it, long before it was &s;ent to <HI>D'Albeville.</HI> So I petitioned the States, who were then &s;itting, to be naturalized in order to my intended marriage. And this pa&s;t in cour&s;e, without the lea&s;t difficulty; which perhaps might have been made, if this pro|&s;ecution, now begun in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had been known. Now I was legally under the protection of the States of <HI>Holland.</HI> Yet I writ a full ju&s;tification of my &s;elf, as to all particulars laid to my charge, in &s;ome letters that I &s;ent to the Earl of <HI>Middleton.</HI> But in one of the&s;e I &s;aid, that, being now naturalized in <HI>Holland,</HI> my allegiance was, during my &s;tay in the&s;e parts, transferred from his Maje&s;ty to the States. I al&s;o &s;aid in another letter, that, if upon my non-appearance a &s;entence &s;hould pa&s;s again&s;t me, I might be perhaps forced to ju&s;tify my &s;elf, and to give an account of the &s;hare that I had in affairs the&s;e twenty years pa&s;t: In which I might be led to mention &s;ome things, that I
<PB N="727" REF="743">
was afraid would di&s;plea&s;e the King: And therefore I &s;hould be &s;orry, if I were driven to it.</P>
<P>Now the Court thought they had &s;omewhat again&s;t me: For they knew they had nothing before. So the fir&s;t citation was let fall, and a new one was ordered on the&s;e two accounts. It was pretended to be high trea&s;on, to &s;ay my allegiance was now transferred: And it was &s;et forth, as a high indignity to the King, to threaten him with writing a hi&s;tory of the trans|actions pa&s;t the&s;e la&s;t twenty years. The fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;truck at a great point, which was a part of the law of Nations. Every man that was naturalized took an oath of allegiance to the Prince or State that naturalized him. And, &s;ince no man can &s;erve two ma&s;ters, or be under a double allegiance, it is certain, that there mu&s;t be a transfer of allegiance, at lea&s;t during the &s;tay in the country where one is &s;o naturalized.</P>
<P>This matter was kept up again&s;t me for &s;ome time, the Court delaying proceeding to any &s;entence for &s;everal months. At la&s;t a &s;entence of outlawry was given: And upon that <HI>Albe|ville</HI> &s;aid, that, if the States would not deliver me up, he would find &s;uch in&s;truments as &s;hould &s;eize on me, and carry me away forcibly. The methods he named of doing this were very ri|diculous. And he &s;poke of it to &s;o many per&s;ons, that I be|lieve his de&s;ign was rather to frighten me, than that he could think to effect them. Many overtures were made to &s;ome of my friends in <HI>London,</HI> not only to let this pro&s;ecution fall, but to promote me, if I would make my &s;elf capable of it. I en|tertained none of the&s;e. I had many &s;tories brought me of the di&s;cour&s;es among &s;ome of the brutal <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> then in the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;ervice. But, I thank God, I was not moved with them. I re|&s;olved to go on, and to do my duty, and to do what &s;ervice I could to the publick, and to my Country: And re&s;igned my &s;elf up entirely to that Providence, that had watched over me to that time with an indulgent care, and had made all the de|&s;igns of my enemies again&s;t me turn to my great advantage.</P>
<P>I come now to the year 1688, which proved memorable, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">1688</NOTE> produced an extraordinary and unheard-of Revolution. The year in this Century made all people reflect on the &s;ame year in the former Century, in which the power of <HI>Spain</HI> received &s;o great a check, that the decline of that Monarchy began then; and <HI>England</HI> was &s;aved from an inva&s;ion, that, if it had &s;ucceeded as happily as it was well laid, mu&s;t have ended in the ab&s;olute con|que&s;t and utter ruin of the Nation. Our books are &s;o full of all that related to that <HI>Armada,</HI> boa&s;ted to be invincible, that I need add no more of &s;o known and &s;o remarkable a piece of
<PB N="728" REF="744">
our hi&s;tory. A new eighty eight rai&s;ed new expectations, in which the &s;urpri&s;ing events did far exceed all that could have been looked for.</P>
<P>I begin the year with <HI>Albeville's</HI> negotiation after his com|ing <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Albevil|les</HI>'s memo|rial to the States.</NOTE> to the <HI>Hague.</HI> He had before his going over given in a threatning memorial upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Bantam,</HI> that look|ed like a prelude of a declaration of war; for he demanded a pre&s;ent an&s;wer, &s;ince the King could no longer bear the in|ju&s;tice done him in that matter, which was &s;et forth in very high words. He &s;ent this memorial to be printed at <HI>Am&s;ter|dam,</HI> before he had communicated it to the States. The chief effect that this had was, that the Actions of the Com|pany did &s;ink for &s;ome days. But they ro&s;e &s;oon again: And by this it was &s;aid, that <HI>Albeville</HI> him&s;elf made the greate&s;t gain. The <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> fleet was then expected home every day. So the Merchants, who remembred well the bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Smirna</HI> fleet in the year &s;eventy two, did apprehend that the King had &s;ent a fleet to intercept them, and that this memorial was intended only to prepare an apology for that breach, when it &s;hould happen: But nothing of that &s;ort followed upon it. The States did an&s;wer this memorial with another, that was firm, but more decently expre&s;&s;ed: By their la&s;t treaty with <HI>England</HI> it was provided, that, in ca&s;e any di&s;putes &s;hould ari&s;e between the Merchants of either &s;ide, Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be named of both &s;ides to hear and judge the matter: The King had not yet named any of his &s;ide: So that the delay lay at his door: They were therefore amazed to receive a memorial in &s;o high a &s;train, &s;ince they had done all that by the treaty was incum|bent on them. <HI>Albeville</HI> after this gave in another memori|al, in which he de&s;ired them to &s;end over Commi&s;&s;ioners for end|ing that di&s;pute. But, tho' this was a great fall from the height in which the former memorial was conceived, yet in this the thing was &s;o ill apprehended, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had rea&s;on to be|lieve that the King's Mini&s;ters did not know the treaty, or were not at lei&s;ure to read it: For, according to the treaty, and the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of that bu&s;ine&s;s, the King was obliged to &s;end over Commi&s;&s;ioners to the <HI>Hague</HI> to judge of that affair. When this memorial was an&s;wered, and the treaty was examined, the matter was let fall.</P>
<P><HI>Albeville</HI>'s next negotiation related to my &s;elf. I had print|ed a paper in ju&s;tification of my &s;elf, together with my letters to the Earl of <HI>Middleton.</HI> And he in a memorial complained of two pa&s;&s;ages in that paper. One was, that I &s;aid it was yet too early to per&s;ecute men for religion, and therefore crimes again&s;t the State were pretended by my enemies: This, he &s;aid, did in&s;inuate, that the King did in time intend to per&s;ecute
<PB N="729" REF="745">
for religion. The other was, that I had put in it an intima|tion, that I was in danger by &s;ome of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Papi&s;ts. This, he &s;aid, was a reflection on the King, who hated all &s;uch prac|tices. And to this he added, that by the laws of <HI>England</HI> all the King's &s;ubjects were bound to &s;eize on any per&s;on that was condemned in his Courts, in what manner &s;oever they could: And therefore he de&s;ired, that both I and the printer of that paper might be puni&s;hed. But now upon his return to the <HI>Hague,</HI> I being outlawed by that time, he demanded, that, in pur&s;u|ance of an article of the treaty that related to rebels or fugi|tives, I might be bani&s;hed the Provinces. And to this he craved once and again a &s;peedy an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I was called before the Deputies of the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> that I might an&s;wer the two memorials that lay before them relat|ing to my &s;elf. I ob&s;erved the difference between them. The one de&s;ired, that the States would puni&s;h me, which did acknow|ledge me to be their &s;ubject. The other, in contradiction to that, laid claim to me as the King's rebel. As to the parti|culars complained of, I had made no reflection on the King; but to the contrary. I &s;aid, my enemies found it was not yet time to per&s;ecute for religion. This in&s;inuated, that the King could not be brought to it. And no per&s;on could be offended with this, but he who thought it was now not too early to per|&s;ecute. As to that of the danger in which I apprehended my &s;elf to be in, I had now more rea&s;on than before to complain of it, &s;ince the Envoy had &s;o publickly affirmed, that every one of the King's &s;ubjects might &s;eize on any one that was con|demned, in what manner &s;oever they could, which was either dead or alive. I was now the &s;ubject of the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> naturalized in order to a marriage among them, as they all knew: And therefore I claimed their protection. So, if I was charged with any thing that was not according to law, I &s;ub|mitted my &s;elf to their ju&s;tice. I &s;hould decline no trial, nor the utmo&s;t &s;everity, if I had offended in any thing. As for the two memorials that claimed me as a fugitive and a rebel, I could not be looked on as a fugitive from <HI>Scotland.</HI> It was now four|teen years &s;ince I had left that Kingdom, and three &s;ince I came out of <HI>England</HI> with the King's leave. I had lived a year in the <HI>Hague</HI> openly; and nothing was laid to my charge. As for the &s;entence that was pretended to be pa&s;t upon me, I could &s;ay nothing to it, till I &s;aw a copy of it.</P>
<P>The States were fully &s;atisfied with my an&s;wers; and ordered <NOTE PLACE="marg">The States an&s;wer to what related to me.</NOTE> a memorial to be drawn according to them. They al&s;o or|dered their Emba&s;&s;ador to repre&s;ent to the King, that he him|&s;elf knew how &s;acred a thing naturalization was. The faith and

<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE">
<PB N="729" REF="747">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE">
<PB N="730" REF="748">
honour of every State was concerned in it. I had been natu|ralized upon marrying one of their &s;ubjects, which was the ju&s;te&s;t of all rea&s;ons. If the King had any thing to lay to my charge, ju&s;tice &s;hould be done in their Courts. The King took the matter very ill; and &s;aid, it was an affront to him, and a ju&s;t cau&s;e of war. Yet, after much pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;aid, he did not intend to make war upon it; for he was not then in conditi|on to do it. But he knew there were de&s;igns again&s;t him, to make war on him, again&s;t which he &s;hould take care to &s;ecure him&s;elf: And he &s;hould be on his guard. The Emba&s;&s;ador a&s;ked him, of whom he meant that. But he did not think fit to explain him&s;elf further. He ordered a third memorial to be put in again&s;t me, in which the article of the treaty was &s;et forth: But no notice was taken of the an&s;wers made to that by the States: But it was in&s;i&s;ted on, that, &s;ince the States were bound not to give &s;anctuary to fugitives and rebels, they ought not to examine the grounds on which &s;uch judg|ments were given, but were bound to execute the treaty. Up|on this it was ob&s;erved, that the words in treaties ought to be explained according to their common acceptation, or the &s;en&s;e given them in the civil law, and not according to any parti|cular forms of Courts, where for non-appearance a writ of outlawry or rebellion might lie: The &s;en&s;e of the word Rebel in common u&s;e was, a man that had born arms, or had plotted again&s;t his Prince: And a fugitive was a man that fled from ju&s;tice. The heat with which the King &s;eemed inflamed again&s;t me, car|ried him to &s;ay and do many things that were very little to his honour.</P>
<P>I had adverti&s;ements &s;ent me of a further progre&s;s in his de|&s;igns again&s;t me. He had it &s;ugge&s;ted to him, that, &s;ince a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Other de|&s;igns again&s;t $word$</NOTE> &s;entence was pa&s;t again&s;t me for non-appearance, and the States refu&s;ed to deliver me up, he might order private per&s;ons to execute the &s;entence as they could: And it was writ over very po&s;itively, that 5000 <HI>l.</HI> would be given to any one that &s;hould murder me. A Gentleman of an unblemi&s;hed reputati|on writ me word, that he him&s;elf by accident &s;aw an order drawn in the Secretaries Office, but not yet &s;igned, for 3000 <HI>l.</HI> to a blank per&s;on that was to &s;eize or de&s;troy me. And he al|&s;o affirmed, that Prince <HI>George</HI> had heard of the &s;ame thing, and had de&s;ired the per&s;on to whom he tru&s;ted it to convoy the notice of it to me: And my author was employed by that per&s;on to &s;end the notice to me. The King a&s;ked <HI>Je&s;&s;eries,</HI> what he might do again&s;t me in a private way, now that he could not get me into his hands. <HI>Je&s;&s;eries</HI> an&s;wered, he did not &s;ee how the King could do any more than he had done.
<PB N="731" REF="749">
He told this to Mr. <HI>Kirk</HI> to &s;end it to me: For he concluded, the King was re&s;olved to proceed to extremities, and only want|ed the opinion of a man of the law to ju&s;tify a more violent method. I had &s;o many different adverti&s;ements &s;ent me of this, that I concluded a whi&s;per of &s;uch a de&s;ign might have been &s;et about, on de&s;ign to frighten me into &s;ome mean &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, or into &s;ilence at lea&s;t. But it had no other effect on me, but that I thought it fit to &s;tay more within doors, and to u&s;e a little more than ordinary caution. I thank God, I was very little concerned at it. I re&s;igned up my life very freely to God. I knew my own innocence, and the root of all the malice that was again&s;t me. And I never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my own &s;oul in a more perfect calm, and in a clearer cheerfulne&s;s of &s;pirit, than I did during all tho&s;e threatnings, and the apprehen&s;ions that others were in concerning me.</P>
<P>Soon after this a letter writ by <HI>Fagel</HI> the Pen&s;ioner of <HI>Hol|land</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pen&s;ioner <HI>$agel</HI>'s let|ter.</NOTE> was printed: Which leads me to look back a little into a tran&s;action that pa&s;&s;ed the former year. There was one <HI>Stew|ard,</HI> a lawyer of <HI>Scotland,</HI> a man of great parts, and of as great ambition. He had given over the practice of the law, becau&s;e all that were admitted to the bar in <HI>Scotland</HI> were required to renounce the Covenant, which he would not do. This recom|mended him to the confidence of that whole party. They had made great u&s;e of him, and tru&s;ted him entirely. <HI>Pen</HI> had en|gaged him, who had been long con&s;idered by the King as the chief manager of all the rebellions and plots that had been on foot the&s;e twenty years pa&s;t, more particularly of <HI>Argile</HI>'s, to come over: And he undertook, that he &s;hould not only be re|ceived into favour, but into confidence. He came, before he cro&s;&s;ed the Seas, to the Prince, and promi&s;ed an inviolable fide|lity to him, and to the common intere&s;ts of religion and liber|ty. He had been oft with the Pen&s;ioner, and had a great mea|&s;ure of his confidence. Upon his coming to Court, he was ca|re&s;&s;ed to a degree that amazed all who knew him. He either believed, that the King was &s;incere in the profe&s;&s;ions he made, and that his de&s;igns went no further than to &s;ettle a full liber|ty of con&s;cience: Or he thought, that it became a man who had been &s;o long in di&s;grace, not to &s;hew any jealou&s;ies at fir&s;t, when the King was &s;o gracious to him. He undertook to do all that lay in his power to advance his de&s;igns in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to repre&s;ent his intentions &s;o at the <HI>Hague,</HI> as might incline the Prince to a better opinion of them.</P>
<P>He opened all this in &s;everal letters to the Pen&s;ioner. And in the&s;e he pre&s;&s;ed him vehemently, in the King's name, and by his direction, to per&s;uade the Prince to concur with the King
<PB N="732" REF="750">
in procuring the laws to be repealed. He laid before him the incon&s;iderable number of the Papi&s;ts: So that there was no rea|&s;on to apprehend much from them. He al&s;o enlarged on the &s;everities that the penal laws had brought on the Di&s;&s;enters. The King was re&s;olved not to con&s;ent to the repealing them, unle&s;s the Te&s;ts were taken away with them: So that the re|fu&s;ing to con&s;ent to this might at another time bring them un|der another &s;evere pro&s;ecution. <HI>Steward,</HI> after he had writ many letters to this purpo&s;e without receiving any an&s;wers, tried if he could &s;erve the King in <HI>Scotland</HI> with more &s;ucce&s;s, than it &s;eemed he was like to have at the <HI>Hague.</HI> But he found there, that his old friends were now much alienated from him, look|ing on him as a per&s;on entirely gained by the Court.</P>
<P>The Pen&s;ioner laid all his letters before the Prince. They were al&s;o brought to me. The Prince upon this thought, that a full an&s;wer made by <HI>Fagell,</HI> in &s;uch a manner as that it might be publi&s;hed as a declaration of his intentions, might be of &s;er|vice to him in many re&s;pects; chiefly in Popi&s;h Courts, that were on civil accounts inclined to an alliance again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> but were now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an opinion of the Prince, and of his party in <HI>England,</HI> as de&s;igning nothing but the ruin and extir|pation of all the Papi&s;ts in tho&s;e Kingdoms. So the Pen|&s;ioner wrote a long an&s;wer to <HI>Steward,</HI> which was put in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by me.</P>
<P>He began it with great a&s;&s;urances of the Prince and Prince&s;s's duty to the King. They were both of them much again&s;t all per&s;ecution on the account of religion. They freely con&s;ented to the covering Papi&s;ts from the &s;everities of the laws made again&s;t them on the account of their religion, and al&s;o that they might have the free exerci&s;e of it in private. They al&s;o con&s;ented to grant a full liberty to Di&s;&s;enters. But they could not con|&s;ent to the repeal of tho&s;e laws that tended only to the &s;ecur|ing the Prote&s;tant religion; &s;uch as tho&s;e concerning the Te&s;ts, which imported no puni&s;hment, but only an incapacity of be|ing in publick employments, which could not be complain|ed of as great &s;everities. This was a caution ob&s;erved in all Nations, and was now nece&s;&s;ary, both for &s;ecuring the pub|lick peace and the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion. If the numbers of the Papi&s;ts were &s;o &s;mall as to make them incon&s;iderable, then it was not rea&s;onable to make &s;uch a change for the &s;ake of a few. And if tho&s;e few, that pretended to publick employments, would do all their own party &s;o great a prejudice, as not to &s;uf|fer the King to be content with the repeal of the penal laws, unle&s;s they could get into the offices of tru&s;t, then their am|bition was only to be blamed, if the offers now made were
<PB N="733" REF="751">
not accepted. The matter was very &s;trongly argued thro' the whole letter: And the Prince and Prince&s;s's zeal for the Pro|te&s;tant Religion was &s;et out in terms, that could not be very acceptable to the King. The letter was carried by <HI>Steward</HI> to the King, and was brought by him into the Cabinet Council. But nothing followed then upon it. The King ordered <HI>Steward</HI> to write back, that he would either have all or nothing. All the Lay-Papi&s;ts of <HI>England,</HI> who were not engaged in the in|trigues of the Prie&s;ts, pre&s;&s;ed earne&s;tly that the King would ac|cept of the repeal of the penal laws; which was offered, and would have made them both ea&s;y and &s;afe for the future. The Emperor was fully &s;atisfied with what was offered; and promi&s;|ed to u&s;e his intere&s;t at <HI>Rome,</HI> to get the Pope to write to the King to accept of this, as a &s;tep to the other: But I could not learn whether he did it, or not. If he did, it had no ef|fect. The King was in all points governed by the Je&s;uits, and the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Petre,</HI> as he had been long in the confidence, was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Father <HI>Petre</HI> made a Privy Coun&s;ellor.</NOTE> now brought to the Council board, and made a Privy Coun|&s;ellor: And it was given out, that the King was re&s;olved to get a Cardinal's Cap for him, and to make him Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York.</HI> The Pope was &s;till firm to his re&s;olution again&s;t it. But it was hoped, that the King would conquer it, if not in the pre&s;ent, yet at furthe&s;t in the next Pontificate. The King re&s;olved at the &s;ame time not to di&s;gu&s;t the Secular Prie&s;ts: So Bi&s;hop <HI>Ley|burn,</HI> whom Cardinal <HI>Howard</HI> had &s;ent over with the Epi&s;co|pal character, was made much u&s;e of in appearance, tho' he had no great &s;hare in the coun&s;els. There was a faction form|ed between the Seculars and the Je&s;uits, which was &s;ometimes near breaking out into an open rupture. But the King was &s;o partial to the Je&s;uits, that the others found they were not on equal terms with them. There were three other Bi&s;hops con&s;ecrated for <HI>England.</HI> And the&s;e four were ordered to make a progre&s;s and circuit over <HI>England,</HI> confirming, and doing other Epi&s;|copal offices, in all the parts of <HI>England.</HI> Great numbers ga|thered about them, where&s;oever they went.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uits thought all was &s;ure, and that their &s;cheme was <NOTE PLACE="marg">The $word$ of the Je&s;uits.</NOTE> &s;o well laid that it could not mi&s;carry. And they had &s;o po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed that contemptible tool of theirs, <HI>Albeville,</HI> with this, that he &s;eemed upon his return to the <HI>Hague</HI> to be &s;o &s;anguine, that he did not &s;tick to &s;peak out, what a wi&s;er man would have &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed tho' he had believed it. One day, when the Prince was &s;peaking of the promi&s;es the King had made, and the oath that he had &s;worn to maintain the laws and the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church, he, in&s;tead of pretending that the King &s;till kept his word,
<PB N="734" REF="752">
&s;aid, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions Princes mu&s;t forget their promi&s;es. And, when the Prince &s;aid, that the King ought to have more regard to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> which was the main body of the Nation, <HI>Albeville</HI> an&s;wered, that the body which he called the Church of <HI>England</HI> would not have a being two years to an end. Thus he &s;poke out the de&s;igns of the Court, both too early and too openly. But at the &s;ame time he behaved him|&s;elf in all other re&s;pects &s;o poorly, that he became the je&s;t of the <HI>Hague.</HI> The foreign Mini&s;ters, Mr. <HI>D'Avaux</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Em|ba&s;&s;ador not excepted, did not know how to excu&s;e or bear with his weakne&s;s, which appeared on all occa&s;ions and in all companies.</P>
<P>What he wrote to <HI>England</HI> upon his fir&s;t audiences was not <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pen|&s;ioner's let|ter was printed.</NOTE> known. But it was &s;oon after &s;pread up and down the King|dom, very artificially and with much indu&s;try, that the Prince and Prince&s;s had now con&s;ented to the repeal of the Te&s;ts, as well as of the penal laws. This was writ over by many hands to the <HI>Hague.</HI> The Prince, to prevent the ill effects that might fol|low on &s;uch reports, gave orders to print the Pen&s;ioner's letter to <HI>Steward;</HI> which was &s;ent to all the parts of <HI>England,</HI> and was received with an univer&s;al joy. The Di&s;&s;enters &s;aw them&s;elves now &s;afe in his intentions towards them. The Church party was confirmed in their zeal for maintaining the Te&s;ts. And the Lay-Papi&s;ts &s;eemed likewi&s;e to be &s;o well plea&s;ed with it, that they complained of tho&s;e ambitious Prie&s;ts, and hungry Cour|tiers, who were re&s;olved, rather than lay down their a&s;pirings and other projects, to leave them &s;till expo&s;ed to the &s;eve|rities of the laws, tho' a freedom from the&s;e was now offered to them. But it was not ea&s;y to judge, whether this was &s;in|cerely meant by them, or if it was only a popular art, to re|commend them&s;elves under &s;uch a moderate appearance. The Court &s;aw the hurt that this letter did them. At fir&s;t they hoped to have &s;tifled it by calling it an impo&s;ture. But when they were driven from that, the King began to &s;peak &s;everely and indecently of the Prince, not only to all about him, but even to foreign Mini&s;ters: And re&s;olved to put &s;uch marks of his indignation upon him, as &s;hould let all the world &s;ee how $word$ it was.</P>
<P>There were &s;ix Regiments of the King's &s;ubjects, three <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> and three <HI>Scoti&s;h,</HI> in the &s;ervice of the States. Some of them were old Regiments, that had continued in their &s;ervice dur|ing the two wars in the late King's reign. Others were rai&s;ed $word$ the peace in &s;eventy three. But the&s;e came not into their &s;ervice under any capitulation, that had re&s;erved an authority to the King to call for them at his plea&s;ure. When <HI>Argile</HI> and
<PB N="735" REF="753">
<HI>Monmouth</HI> made their inva&s;ion, the King de&s;ired that the States would lend them to him. Some of the towns of <HI>Holland</HI> were &s;o jealous of the King, and wi&s;hed <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s &s;ucce&s;s &s;o much, that the Prince found &s;ome difficulty in obtaining the con&s;ent of the States to &s;end them over. There was no di&s;tinction made among them between Papi&s;ts and Prote&s;tants, according to a maxim of the States with relation to their armies: So there were &s;everal Papi&s;ts in tho&s;e Regiments. And the King had &s;hewed &s;uch particular kindne&s;s to the&s;e, while they were in <HI>England,</HI> that at their return they formed a faction which was breeding great di&s;tractions among them. This was very unea&s;y to the Prince, who began to &s;ee that he might have oc|ca&s;ion to make u&s;e of tho&s;e bodies, if things &s;hould be carried to a rupture between the King and him: And yet he did not know how he could tru&s;t them, while &s;uch Officers were in command. He did not &s;ee neither, how he could get rid of them well. But the King helped him out of that difficulty: He wrote to the States, that he had occa&s;ion for the &s;ix Regi|ments of his &s;ubjects that were in their &s;ervice, and de&s;ired that they &s;hould be &s;ent over to him.</P>
<P>This demand was made all of the &s;udden, without any pre|vious <NOTE PLACE="marg">Which was refu&s;ed, but the Officers had leave to go.</NOTE> application to any of the States, to di&s;po&s;e them to grant it, or to many of the Officers to per&s;uade them to a&s;k their <HI>Cong&egrave;</HI> to go over. The States pretended the Regiments were theirs: They had paid levy money for them, and had them un|der no capitulation: So they excu&s;ed them&s;elves, that they could not part with them. But they gave orders, that all the Officers that &s;hould a&s;k their <HI>Cong&egrave;,</HI> &s;hould have it. Thirty or forty came and a&s;ked, and had their <HI>Cong&egrave;.</HI> So now the Prince was delivered from &s;ome trouble&s;ome men by this management of the King's. Upon that, the&s;e bodies were &s;o modeled, that the Prince knew, that he might depend entirely on them: And he was no more di&s;turbed by tho&s;e in&s;olent Officers, who had for &s;ome years behaved them&s;elves rather as enemies, than as per&s;ons in the States pay.</P>
<P>The di&s;cour&s;e of a Parliament was often taken up, and as of|ten let fall: And it was not ea&s;y to judge in what &s;uch fluctu|ating coun&s;els would end. Father <HI>Petre</HI> had gained &s;uch an a&s;cendant, that he was con&s;idered as the fir&s;t Mini&s;ter of State. The Nuncio had moved the King to interpo&s;e, and mediate a reconciliation between the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> But he an&s;wered, that &s;ince the Pope would not gratify him in the promotion of Father <HI>Petre,</HI> he would leave him to free him&s;elf of the trouble into which he had involved him&s;elf the be&s;t way he could. And our Court reckoned, that as &s;oon as the Pope
<PB N="736" REF="754">
felt him&s;elf pre&s;&s;ed, he would fly to the King for protection, and grant him every thing that he a&s;ked of him in order to obtain it. That Je&s;uit gave daily new proofs of a weak and ill governed pa&s;&s;ion, and di&s;covered all the ill qualities of one, that &s;eemed rai&s;ed up to be the common incendiary, and to drive the King and his party to the precipice.</P>
<P>Towards the end of <HI>April</HI> the King thought fit to renew the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A new de|claration for toleration.</NOTE> declaration, that he had &s;et out the former year for liberty of con&s;cience; with an addition, declaring that he would adhere firmly to it, and that he would put none in any publick em|ployments, but &s;uch as would concur with him in maintaining it. He al&s;o promi&s;ed, that he would hold a Parliament in the <HI>November</HI> following. This promi&s;e of a Parliament &s;o long beforehand was &s;omewhat extraordinary. Both Father <HI>Petre</HI> and <HI>Pen</HI> engaged the King to it, but with a different pro&s;pect. <HI>Pen,</HI> and all the tools who were employed by him, had &s;till &s;ome hopes of carrying a Parliament to agree with the King, if too much time was not lo&s;t: Whereas the delaying a Parliament rai&s;ed jealou&s;ies, as if none were intended, but that it was only talked of to amu&s;e the Nation till other de&s;igns were ripe.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Father <HI>Petre</HI> and his cabal &s;aw that the King was kept off from many things that they propo&s;ed, with the expectation of the concurrence of a Parliament: And the fear of giving new di&s;gu&s;ts, which might ob&s;truct that, had be|got a caution that was very unea&s;y to them. They thought that much time was already lo&s;t, and that they made but a &s;mall progre&s;s. They began to apprehend, that the Regula|tors, who were &s;till feeding them with hopes, and were a&s;king more time and more money, did intend only to amu&s;e them, and to wear out the bu&s;ine&s;s into more length, and to keep them&s;elves the longer in credit and in pay; but that they did not in their hearts wi&s;h well to the main de&s;ign, and therefore acted but an in&s;incere part with the King. Therefore they re|&s;olved to put that matter to the la&s;t trial, reckoning that, if the King &s;aw it was in vain to hope for any thing in a Parlia|mentary way, he might be more ea&s;ily carried to extream and violent methods.</P>
<P>The King was not &s;atisfied with the publi&s;hing his declara|tion: <NOTE PLACE="marg">W$span$e $word$ were $span$</NOTE> But he re&s;olved to oblige the Clergy to read it in all their Churches in the time of divine &s;ervice. And now it appeared, what bad effects were like to follow on that officious motion that <HI>Sancroft</HI> had made, for obliging the Clergy to read the declara|tion that King <HI>Charles</HI> &s;et out in the year 1681, after the di&s;|&s;olution of the <HI>Oxford</HI> Parliament. An order pa&s;t in Council,
<PB N="737" REF="755">
requiring the Bi&s;hops to &s;end copies of the declaration to all their Clergy, and to order them to read it on two &s;everal <HI>Sun|days</HI> in time of divine &s;ervice.</P>
<P>This put the Clergy under great difficulties. And they were at fir&s;t much divided about it. Even many of the be&s;t and wor|thie&s;t of them were under &s;ome di&s;traction of thought. They had many meetings, and argued the point long among them|&s;elves, in and about <HI>London.</HI> On the one hand it was &s;aid, that if they refu&s;ed to read it, the King would proceed again&s;t them for di&s;obedience. It did not &s;eem rea&s;onable to run &s;o great a hazard upon &s;uch a point, that was not &s;trong enough to bear the con&s;equences that might follow on a breach. Their reading it did not import their approving it. But was only a publication of an act of their King's. So it was propo&s;ed, to &s;ave the whole by making &s;ome declaration, that their read|ing it was a meer act of obedience, and did not import any a&s;&s;ent and approbation of theirs. Others thought, that the pub|li&s;hing this in &s;uch manner was only impo&s;ed on them to make them odious and contemptible to the whole Nation, for read|ing that which was intended for their ruin. If they carried their compliance &s;o far, that might provoke the Nobility and Gen|try to carry theirs much further. If they once yielded the point, that they were bound to read every declaration, with this &s;alvo that it did not import their approving it, they would be then bound to read every thing that &s;hould be &s;ent to them: The King might make declarations in favour of all the points of Popery, and require them to read them: And they could not &s;ee where they mu&s;t make their &s;tops, if they did it not now. So it &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary to fix on this, as a rule, that they ought to publi&s;h nothing in time of divine &s;ervice, but that which they approved of. The point at pre&s;ent was not, whe|ther a toleration was a lawful or an expedient thing. The de|claration was founded on the claim of a di&s;pen&s;ing power, which the King did now a&s;&s;ume, that tended to the total &s;ub|ver&s;ion of the government, and the making it arbitrary; where|as by the con&s;titution it was a legal admini&s;tration. It al&s;o al|lowed &s;uch an infinite liberty, with the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of all penal laws, and that without any limitation, that Pagani&s;m it &s;elf might be now publickly profe&s;&s;ed. It was vi&s;ible, that the de|&s;ign in impo&s;ing the reading of it on them, was only to make them ridiculous, and to make them contribute to their own ruin. As for the danger that they might incur, they &s;aw their ruin was re&s;olved on: And nothing they could do was like to prevent it, unle&s;s they would ba&s;ely &s;acrifice their religion to their worldly intere&s;ts. It would be perhaps a year &s;ooner or
<PB N="738" REF="756">
later by any other management: It was therefore fit, that they &s;hould prepare them&s;elves for &s;uffering; and not endeavour to prevent it by doing that, which would draw on them the hatred of their friends, and the &s;corn of their enemies.</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons prevailed: And they re&s;olved not to read the <NOTE PLACE="marg">To which they would not give o|bedience.</NOTE> declaration. They &s;aw of what importance it was, that they &s;hould be unanimous in this. Nothing could be of more fatal con&s;equence than their being divided in their practice. For, if any con&s;iderable body of the Clergy, &s;uch as could carry the name of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> could have been prevailed on to give obedience, and only &s;ome number, how valuable &s;oever the men might be, &s;hould refu&s;e to obey; then the Court might &s;till pretend, that they would maintain the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ingle out all tho&s;e who had not given obedience, and fall on them, and &s;o break the Church within it&s;elf upon this point, and then de&s;troy the one half by the means of the re&s;t. The mo&s;t eminent re&s;olved not to obey: And tho&s;e who might be prevailed on to comply would by that means fall under &s;uch contempt, that they could not have the credit or &s;trength to &s;upport the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion. The Court depended upon this, that the greater part would obey: And &s;o they would be fur|ni&s;hed with a point of State, to give a colour for turning out the di&s;obedient, who were like to be the men that &s;tood mo&s;t in their way, and cro&s;&s;ed their de&s;igns mo&s;t, both with their learning and credit.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e few Bi&s;hops that were engaged in the de&s;ign of be|traying the Church, were per&s;uaded that this would be the event of the matter: And they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the King with the hope of it &s;o po&s;itively, that he &s;eemed to depend upon it. The cor|re&s;pondence over <HI>England</HI> was managed with that &s;ecrecy, that the&s;e re&s;olutions were &s;o communicated to the Clergy in the Country, that they were generally engaged to agree in their con|duct, before the Court came to apprehend that they would be &s;o unanimous, as it proved in conclu&s;ion that they were.</P>
<P>The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury, Sancroft,</HI> re&s;olved upon this <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arch+bi&s;hop $word$ $span$ King</NOTE> occa&s;ion to act &s;uitably to his po&s;t and character. He wrote round his Province, and de&s;ired that &s;uch of the Bi&s;hops as were able would come up, and con&s;ult together in a matter of this great concern: And he a&s;ked the opinion of tho&s;e, whom their age and infirmities di&s;abled from taking the journey. He found, that eighteen of the Bi&s;hops, and the main body of the Clergy, con|curred in the re&s;olution again&s;t reading the declaration. So he, with &s;ix of the Bi&s;hops that came up to <HI>London,</HI> re&s;olved in a peti|tion to the King, to lay before him the rea&s;ons that deter|mined them not to obey the order of Council that had been
<PB N="739" REF="757">
&s;ent them: This flowed from no want of re&s;pect to his Ma|je&s;ty's authority, nor from any unwillingne&s;s to let favour be &s;hewed to Di&s;&s;enters; in relation to whom they were willing to come to &s;uch a temper, as &s;hould be thought fit, when that matter &s;hould be con&s;idered and &s;ettled in Parliament and Con|vocation: But, this declaration being founded on &s;uch a di&s;pen|&s;ing power, as had been often declared illegal in Parliament, both in the year 1662 and in the year 1672, and in the be|ginning of his own reign, and was a matter of &s;o great con|&s;equence to the whole Nation, both in Church and State; they could not in prudence, honour, and con&s;cience, make them|&s;elves &s;o far parties to it, as the publication of it once and again in God's hou&s;e, and in the time of divine &s;ervice, mu&s;t amount to.</P>
<P>The Archbi&s;hop was then in an ill State of health. So he &s;ent over the &s;ix Bi&s;hops with the petition to the King, &s;ign|ed by him&s;elf and the re&s;t. The King was much &s;urpri&s;ed with this, being flattered and deceived by his &s;pies. <HI>Cartwright,</HI> Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a &s;tory that was too ea&s;ily believed by him, and was by him carried to the King, who was very apt to believe every thing that &s;uited with his own de&s;igns. The &s;tory was, that the Bi&s;hops intended by a peti|tion to the King to let him under&s;tand that orders of this kind u&s;ed to be addre&s;&s;ed to their Chancellors, but not to them&s;elves; and to pray him to continue that method: And that by this means they hoped to get out of this difficulty. This was very acceptable to the Court, and procured the Bi&s;hops a quick ad|mittance. And they had proceeded &s;o carefully that nothing concerted among them had broken out; for they had been very &s;ecret and cautious. The King, when he heard their petition, and &s;aw his mi&s;take, &s;poke roughly to them. He &s;aid, he was their King, and he would be obeyed: And they &s;hould be made to feel what it was to di&s;obey him. The &s;ix Bi&s;hops were St. <HI>A&s;aph, Ely, Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells, Peterborough, Chiche&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> The an&s;wer they made the King was in the&s;e words: <HI>The will of God be done.</HI> And they came from the Court in a &s;ort of triumph. Now matters were brought to a cri&s;is. The King was engaged on his part, as the Bi&s;hops were on theirs. So all people looked on with great expectations, reckoning that upon the i&s;&s;ue of this bu&s;ine&s;s a great deci&s;ion would be made, both of the de&s;igns of the Court, and of the temper of the Na|tion.</P>
<P>The King con&s;ulted for &s;ome days with all that were now employed by him, what he &s;hould do upon this emergent, and talked with people of all per&s;ua&s;ions. <HI>Lob,</HI> an eminent man
<PB N="740" REF="758">
among the Di&s;&s;enters, who was entirely gained to the Court, advi&s;ed the King to &s;end the Bi&s;hops to the Tower. Father <HI>Petre</HI> &s;eemed now as one tran&s;ported with joy: For he thought the King was engaged to break with the Church of <HI>England.</HI> And it was reported, that he broke out into that indecent ex|pre&s;&s;ion upon it, that they &s;hould be made to eat their own dung. The King was long in doubt. Some of the Popi&s;h Nobility pre&s;&s;ed him earne&s;tly to let the matter fall: For now it appeared, that the body of the Clergy were re&s;olved not to read the declaration. Tho&s;e who did obey, were few and in|con&s;iderable. Only &s;even obeyed in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and not above two hundred all <HI>England</HI> over: And of the&s;e &s;ome read it the fir&s;t <HI>Sunday,</HI> but changed their minds before the &s;econd: Others declared in their &s;ermons, that tho' they obeyed the or|der, they did not approve of the declaration: And one, more plea&s;antly than gravely, told his people, that, tho' he was oblig|ed to read it, they were not obliged to hear it; and he &s;topt till they all went out, and then he read it to the walls: In many places, as &s;oon as the Mini&s;ter began to read it, all the people ro&s;e, and went out.</P>
<P>The King did what he could to encourage tho&s;e that did obey his order. <HI>Parker,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Oxford,</HI> died about this time. He wrote a book again&s;t the Te&s;ts full of petulant &s;currility, of which I &s;hall only give one in&s;tance. He had reflected much on the whole Popi&s;h Plot, and on <HI>Oates</HI>'s evidence: And upon that he called the Te&s;t, the Sacrament of the <HI>Oate&s;ian</HI> villainy. He treated the Parliament that enacted the Te&s;ts with a &s;corn that no Popi&s;h writer had yet ventured on: And he &s;aid much to excu&s;e tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, and to free the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> from the charge of idolatry. This rai&s;ed &s;uch a di&s;gu&s;t of him, even in tho&s;e that had been formerly but too much influenced by him, that, when he could not help &s;eeing that, he &s;unk up|on it. I was de&s;ired to an&s;wer his book with the &s;everity that he de&s;erved: And I did it with an acrimony of &s;tile, that no|thing but &s;uch a time, and &s;uch a man, could in any &s;ort excu&s;e. It was &s;aid, the King &s;ent him my papers, hearing that no body el&s;e dur&s;t put them in his hands, hoping that it would rai&s;e his indignation, and engage him to an&s;wer them. And one <HI>Hall,</HI> a Conformi&s;t in <HI>London,</HI> who was looked on as half a Pre&s;by|terian, yet, becau&s;e he read the declaration, was made Bi&s;hop of <HI>Oxford.</HI> One of the Popi&s;h Bi&s;hops was upon the King's <HI>Man|damus</HI> cho&s;en by the illegal Fellows of <HI>Magdalen</HI>'s College their Pre&s;ident. The &s;en&s;e of the Nation, as well as of the Clergy, had appeared &s;o &s;ignally on this occa&s;ion, that it was vi&s;ible, that the King had not only the &s;even petitioning Bi&s;hops to
<PB N="741" REF="759">
deal with, but the body of the whole Nation, both Clergy and Laity.</P>
<P>The violent advices of Father <HI>Petre,</HI> and the Je&s;uite party, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King ordered the Bi&s;hops to be pro&s;ecuted for it.</NOTE> were &s;o fatally &s;uited to the King's own temper and pa&s;&s;ion, that they prevailed over the wi&s;er coun&s;els of almo&s;t all that were advi&s;ed with. But the King, before he would bring the matter to the Council, &s;ecretly engaged all the Privy Coun&s;ellors to concur with him: And, after a fortnight's con&s;ultation, the Bi&s;hops were cited to appear before the Council. The petition was offered to them; and they were a&s;ked, if they owned it to be their petition. They an&s;wered, it &s;eemed they were to be proceed|ed again&s;t upon that account; &s;o they hoped the King would not pre&s;s them to a confe&s;&s;ion, and then make u&s;e of it again&s;t them: After they had offered this, they owned the petition. They were next charged with the publication of it; for it was then printed. But they ab&s;olutely denied that was done by their means. The Archbi&s;hop had written the petition all in his own hand, without employing any per&s;on to copy it out: And tho' there was one draught written of the petition, as it was agreed on, from which he had written out the original which they had all &s;igned, yet he had kept that &s;till in his own po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and had never &s;hewn it to any per&s;on: So it was not publi&s;hed by them: That mu&s;t have been done by &s;ome of tho&s;e to whom the King had &s;hewed it.</P>
<P>They were in the next place required to enter into bonds to <NOTE PLACE="marg">They were &s;ent to the Tower.</NOTE> appear in the Court of the King's bench, and an&s;wer to an in|formation of mi&s;demeanor. They excepted to this; and &s;aid, that by their Peerage they were not bound to do it. Upon their in&s;i&s;ting on this, they were &s;ent to the Tower, by a war|rant &s;igned by the whole board, except Father <HI>Petre,</HI> who was pa&s;t over by the King's order. This &s;et all the whole City into the highe&s;t fermentation that was ever known in memory of man. The Bi&s;hops were &s;ent by water to the Tower: And all along as they pa&s;t the banks of the river were full of peo|ple, who kneeled down and a&s;ked their ble&s;&s;ing, and with loud &s;houts expre&s;&s;ed their good wi&s;hes for them, and their concern in their pre&s;ervation. The &s;oldiers, and other officers in the Tower, did the &s;ame. An univer&s;al con&s;ternation appeared in all peoples looks. But the King was not moved with all this. And, tho' two days after, upon the Queen's pretended delivery, the King had a fair occa&s;ion to have granted a general pardon to celebrate the joy of that birth, (and it was given out by tho&s;e Papi&s;ts that had always affected to pa&s;s for moderate men, that they had all pre&s;&s;ed this vehemently,) the King was inflexible:
<PB N="742" REF="760">
He &s;aid, his authority would become contemptible, if he &s;uffer|ed &s;uch an affront to pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed.</P>
<P>A week after their commitment, they were brought upon a <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> to the King's bench bar, where their Coun&s;el offered to make it appear to be an illegal commitment: But the Court allowed it good in law. They were required to enter in|to bonds for &s;mall &s;ums, to an&s;wer to the information that day fortnight.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops were di&s;charged of their impri&s;onment: And <NOTE PLACE="marg">But &s;oon af|ter di&s;charg|ed.</NOTE> people of all &s;orts ran to vi&s;it them as Confe&s;&s;ors, one com|pany going in as another went out. The appearance in <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter-Hall</HI> was very &s;olemn: About thirty of the Nobility ac|companying them. All the &s;treets were full of &s;houtings the re&s;t of the day, and with bonefires at night.</P>
<P>When the day fixed for their trial came, there was a va&s;t con|cour&s;e. <NOTE PLACE="marg">They were tried.</NOTE> <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> and all the places about, were full of people, who were &s;trangely affected with the matter. Even the Army, that was then encamped on <HI>Houn&s;low-Heath,</HI> &s;hewed &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition to mutiny, that it gave the King no &s;mall unea&s;ine&s;s. The trial came on, which was chiefly managed again&s;t the Bi&s;hops by Sir <HI>William Williams.</HI> He had been Speaker in two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Parliaments, and was a zealous promoter of the Exclu&s;ion: And he had continued many years a bold pleader in all cau&s;es again&s;t the Court: But he was a corrupt and vicious man, who had no principles, but follow|ed his own intere&s;ts. <HI>Sawyer</HI> the Attorney General, who had for many years &s;erved the ends of the Court in a mo&s;t abject and ob&s;equious manner, would not &s;upport the di&s;pen&s;ing power: So he was turned out, <HI>Powis</HI> being advanced to be Attorney General: And <HI>Williams</HI> was made Solicitor General. <HI>Powis</HI> acted his part in this trial as fairly as his po&s;t could admit of. But <HI>Williams</HI> took very indecent liberties. And he had great ad|vantages over <HI>Sawyer</HI> and <HI>Finch,</HI> who were among the Bi&s;hops Coun&s;el, by reflecting on the precedents and proceedings dur|ing their being the King's Coun&s;el. The King's Coun&s;el could not have full proof, that the Bi&s;hops hands were truly theirs, and were forced to have recour&s;e to the confe&s;&s;ion they had made at the Council board; which was thought very di&s;honourable, &s;ince they had made that confe&s;&s;ion in confidence, tru&s;ting to the King's honour, tho' it did not appear that any promi&s;e was made, that no advantage &s;hould be taken of that confe&s;|&s;ion. No proof was brought of their publi&s;hing it, which was the main point. The pre&s;enting it to the King, and afterwards their owning it to be their petition, when it was put to them at the Coun&s;el board, was all that the King's Coun&s;el could
<PB N="743" REF="761">
offer for proof of this; which was an apparent &s;train, in which even tho&s;e Judges, that were the &s;ure&s;t to the Court, did not &s;eem to be &s;atisfied. It was much urged again&s;t them, that this petition was a libel, tending to the defaming the King's govern|ment.</P>
<P>But to this it was an&s;wered, that they having received an or|der, to which they found they could not give obedience, thought it was incumbent on them, as Bi&s;hops, and as &s;ubjects, to lay before the King their rea&s;ons for it: All &s;ubjects had a right to petition the King: They as Peers were of his great Coun|cil, and &s;o had yet a better claim to that: And that more par|ticularly in matters of religion; for the act of uniformity in Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time had required them under a cur&s;e to look carefully after tho&s;e matters: The di&s;pen&s;ing power had been often brought into debate in Parliament, and was always voted to be again&s;t law: And the late King had yielded the point by recalling his declaration: So they thought, they had a right to repre&s;ent the&s;e things to the King. And occa&s;ion was of|ten taken to reflect on the di&s;pen&s;ing power. To this the King's Coun&s;el replied, that the votes of one or both Hou&s;es were not laws, till they were enacted by King and Parliament: And the late King's pa&s;&s;ing once from a point of his prerogative did not give it up, but only waved it for that time: They urged much the &s;acredne&s;s of the King's authority; that a paper might be true in fact, and yet be a libel; that in Parliament the two Hou&s;es had a right to petition, but it was &s;edition to do it in a point of government out of Parliament.</P>
<P>The trial did la&s;t long, above ten hours. The crouds con|tinued in expectation all the while, and expre&s;&s;ed &s;o great a con|cern for the Bi&s;hops, that the witne&s;&s;es who were brought again&s;t them were not only treated with much &s;corn, and loud laugh|ter upon every occa&s;ion, but &s;eemed to be in &s;uch danger, that they e&s;caped narrowly, going away by a back pa&s;&s;age. Two of the Judges, <HI>Powel</HI> and <HI>Halloway,</HI> delivered their opinion, that there was no &s;editious matter in the petition, and that it was no libel. <HI>Wright</HI> was now brought into this Court and made Chief Ju&s;tice; and <HI>Herbert</HI> was made Chief Ju&s;tice of the Com|mon Pleas: <HI>Herbert</HI> was with the Court in the main of the King's di&s;pen&s;ing power, but was again&s;t them in mo&s;t particulars: So he could not &s;erve their ends in this Court. <HI>Wright</HI> was the properer tool. He in his charge called the petition a libel: But he did not think the publication was proved.</P>
<P>The Jury was fairly returned. When they were &s;hut up, they <NOTE PLACE="marg">And acquit+ted.</NOTE> were &s;oon agreed upon their verdict, to acquit the Bi&s;hops. But it was thought to be both the more &s;olemn, and the &s;afer
<PB N="744" REF="762">
way, to continue &s;hut up till the morning. The King &s;till flattered him&s;elf with the hope that the Bi&s;hops would be brought in guilty. He went that morning to the camp: For the ill humour the Army was in the day before, made him think it nece&s;&s;ary to go and keep them in awe and order by his own pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The Court &s;at again next day. And then the Jury came in <NOTE PLACE="marg">To the great Joy of the Town and Nation.</NOTE> with their verdict. Upon which there were &s;uch &s;houtings, &s;o long continued, and as it were echoed into the City, that all people were &s;truck with it. Every man &s;eemed tran&s;ported with joy. Bonefires were made all about the &s;treets. And the news going over the Nation, produced the like rejoycings and bone|fires all <HI>England</HI> over. The King's pre&s;ence kept the Army in &s;ome order. But he was no &s;ooner gone out of the camp, than he was followed with an univer&s;al &s;houting, as if it had been a victory obtained. And &s;o fatally was the King pu&s;hed on to his ruin, that he &s;eemed not to be by all this enough convinced of the folly of tho&s;e violent coun&s;els. He intended &s;till to pur&s;ue them. It was therefore re&s;olved on, to bring this matter of the contempt of the order of Council in not read|ing the declaration before the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Commi&s;&s;ioners. They did not think fit to cite the Archbi&s;hop and Bi&s;hops before them: For they did not doubt they would plead to their juri&s;|diction, and refu&s;e to acknowledge their authority; which they hoped their Chancellors, and the inferior Clergy, would not venture on.</P>
<P>Citations were &s;ent out requiring the Chancellors, and Arch|deacons <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Clergy was next de|&s;igned a|gain&s;t.</NOTE> to &s;end in the li&s;ts of all the Clergy, both of &s;uch as had obeyed, and of tho&s;e who had not obeyed the order of Council. Some of the&s;e were now &s;o much animated with the &s;en&s;e that the Nation had expre&s;&s;ed of the Bi&s;hop's impri&s;on|ment and trial, that they declared they would not obey this order: And others excu&s;ed them&s;elves in &s;ofter terms. When the day came to which they were cited, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ro|che&s;ter,</HI> tho' he him&s;elf had obeyed the order, and had hitherto gone along, &s;itting with the other Commi&s;&s;ioners, but had al|ways voted on the milder &s;ide, yet now, when he &s;aw matters were running &s;o fa&s;t to the ruin of the Church, he not only would &s;it no longer with them, but wrote a letter to them; in which he &s;aid, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to go on with them any longer, for tho' he him&s;elf had obeyed the order of Council, which he prote&s;ted he did becau&s;e he thought he was bound in con&s;cience to do it, yet he did not doubt but that tho&s;e who had not obeyed it had gone upon the &s;ame principle of following their con&s;cience, and he would much rather choo&s;e
<PB N="745" REF="763">
to &s;uffer with them than to concur in making them &s;uffer. This &s;topped proceedings for that day, and put the Court to a &s;tand. So they adjourned them&s;elves till <HI>December:</HI> And they never &s;at any more.</P>
<P>This was the progre&s;s of that tran&s;action, which was con&s;i|dered <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Effect $span$ had e|very where</NOTE> all <HI>Europe</HI> over as the trial whether the King or the Church were like to prevail. The deci&s;ion was as favourable as was po&s;&s;ible. The King did a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf a power to make laws void, and to qualify men for employments, whom the law had put under &s;uch incapacities that all they did was null and void. The Sheriffs and Mayors of towns were no legal Officers: Judges, (one of them being a profe&s;&s;ed Papi&s;t, <HI>Alibon,)</HI> who took not the Te&s;t, were no Judges: So that the government, and the legal admini&s;tration of it, was broken. A Parliament returned by &s;uch men was no legal Parliament. All this was done by vertue of the di&s;pen&s;ing power, which changed the whole frame of our government, and &s;ubjected all the laws to the King's plea&s;ure: For, upon the &s;ame pretence of that power, other de|clarations might have come out voiding any other laws that the Court found &s;tood in their way; &s;ince we had &s;carce any law that was fortified with &s;uch clau&s;es to force the execution of it, as tho&s;e that were laid a&s;ide had in them. And when the King pretended, that this was &s;uch a &s;acred point of govern|ment, that a petition, offered in the mode&s;te&s;t terms, and in the humble&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible, calling it in que&s;tion, was made &s;o great a crime, and carried &s;o far again&s;t men of &s;uch emi|nence; this I confe&s;s &s;atisfied me, that here was a total de&s;truction of our con&s;titution, avowedly began, and violently pro&s;ecuted. Here was not jealou&s;ies nor fears: The thing was open and avowed. This was not a &s;ingle act of illegal violence, but a declared de|&s;ign again&s;t the whole of our con&s;titution. It was not only the judgment of a Court of law: The King had now by two pub|lick acts of &s;tate, renewed in two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years, openly pub|li&s;hed his de&s;ign. This appeared &s;uch a total &s;ubver&s;ion, that, according to the principles that &s;ome of the highe&s;t a&s;&s;ertors of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience, <HI>Barklay</HI> and <HI>Grotius,</HI> had laid down, it was now lawful for the Nation to look to it&s;elf, and &s;ee to its own pre&s;ervation. And, as &s;oon as any man was convinced that this was lawful, there remained nothing but to look to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who was the only per&s;on that either could &s;ave them, or had a right to it: Since by all the laws in the world, even private as well as publick, he that has in him the rever&s;ion of any e&s;tate has a right to hinder the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, if he goes about to de&s;troy that which is to come to him after the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or's death.</P>
<P><PB N="746" REF="764">
Upon all this di&s;order that <HI>England</HI> was falling into, Admi|ral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> came to the <HI>Hague.</HI> He had a good pretence for coming over to <HI>Holland,</HI> for he had a &s;i&s;ter then living in it. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> pre&s;|&s;ed the Prince.</NOTE> He was de&s;ired by many of great power and intere&s;t in <HI>England</HI> to &s;peak very freely to the Prince, and to know po&s;itively of him what might be expected from him. All people were now in a gaze: Tho&s;e who had little or no religion had no mind to turn Papi&s;ts, if they could &s;ee any probable way of re&s;i&s;ting the fury with which the Court was now driving: But men of fortune, if they &s;aw no vi&s;ible pro&s;pect, would be governed by their pre&s;ent intere&s;t: They were at pre&s;ent united: But, if a breaking &s;hould once happen, and &s;ome men of figure &s;hould be prevailed on to change, that might go far; e&s;pecially in a corrupt and di&s;&s;olute Army, that was as it were let loo&s;e to com|mit crimes and violences every where, in which they were ra|ther encouraged than puni&s;hed; for it &s;eemed to be &s;et up as a maxim, that the Army by rendring it &s;elf odious to the Na|tion would become thereby entirely devoted to the Court: But after all, tho' &s;oldiers were bad <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> and wor&s;e Chri&s;tians, yet the Court found them too good Prote&s;tants to tru&s;t much to them. So <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> put the Prince to explain him&s;elf what he in|tended to do.</P>
<P>The Prince an&s;wered, that, if he was invited by &s;ome men <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince's an&s;wer.</NOTE> of the be&s;t intere&s;t, and the mo&s;t valued in the Nation, who &s;hould both in their own name, and in the name of others who tru&s;ted them, invite him to come and re&s;cue the Nation and the Religion, he believed he could be ready by the end of <HI>Septem|ber</HI> to come over. The main confidence we had was in the Electoral Prince of <HI>Brandenburg;</HI> for the old Elector was then dying. And I told <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> at parting, that, unle&s;s he died, there would be great difficulties, not ea&s;ily ma&s;tered, in the de&s;ign of the Prince's expedition to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>He was then ill of a drop&s;y, which, coming afer a gout of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Elector of <HI>Branden|$span$</HI>'s death</NOTE> a long continuance, &s;eemed to threaten a &s;peedy end of his life. I had the honour to &s;ee him at <HI>Cleve;</HI> and was admitted to two long audiences, in which he was plea&s;ed to &s;peak to me with great freedom. He was a Prince of great courage. He both under&s;tood military matters well, and loved them much. He had a very perfect view of the &s;tate <HI>Europe</HI> had been in for fifty years, in which he had born a great &s;hare in all affairs, having directed his own coun&s;els him&s;elf. He had a wonder|ful memory, even in the &s;malle&s;t matters; for every thing pa&s;t under his eye. He had a quick apprehen&s;ion, and a cholerick temper. The heat of his &s;pirits was apt to kindle too quick, till his intere&s;t cooled him: And that fetched him back, which
<PB N="747" REF="765">
brought him under the cen&s;ure of changing &s;ides too &s;oon and too often. He was a very zealous man in all the concerns of religion. His own life was regular and free of all blemi&s;hes. He tried all that was po&s;&s;ible to bring the <HI>Lutherans</HI> and <HI>Cal|vini&s;ts</HI> to &s;ome terms of reconciliation. He complained much of the rigidity of the <HI>Lutherans,</HI> more particularly of tho&s;e in <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia:</HI> Nor was he well plea&s;ed with the &s;tiffne&s;s of the <HI>Cal|vini&s;ts:</HI> And he inveighed again&s;t the Synod of <HI>Dort,</HI> as that which had &s;et all on fire, and made matters almo&s;t pa&s;t recon|ciling. He thought, all po&s;itive deci&s;ions in tho&s;e matters ought to be laid a&s;ide by both parties, without which nothing could bring them to a better temper.</P>
<P>He had a very &s;plendid Court: And to maintain that, and his great armies, his &s;ubjects were pre&s;&s;ed hard by many unea&s;y taxes. He &s;eemed not to have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the mi&s;eries of his people. His Mini&s;ters had great power over him in all le&s;&s;er matters, while he directed the greater: And he &s;uffered them to enrich them&s;elves exce&s;&s;ively.</P>
<P>In the end of his life the Electore&s;s had gained great credit, and governed his coun&s;els too much. He had &s;et it up for a maxim, that the Electoral families in <HI>Germany</HI> had weakned them&s;elves &s;o much, that they would not be able to maintain the li|berty of the Empire again&s;t the <HI>Au&s;trian</HI> Family, which was now ri&s;ing by their victories in <HI>Hungary:</HI> The Hou&s;es of <HI>Saxe,</HI> and the <HI>Palatine,</HI> and of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> and <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> had done this &s;o much, by the di&s;membring &s;ome of their dominions to their younger children, that they were mouldring to nothing: He therefore re&s;olved to keep all his dominions entire in one hand: This would make his Family the balance to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> on whom the re&s;t of the Empire mu&s;t depend: And he &s;uffer|ed his Electore&s;s to provide for her children, and to enrich her&s;elf by all the ways &s;he could think on, &s;ince he would not give them any &s;hare of his dominions. This &s;he did not fail to do. And the Elector, having ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint for being aban|doned by the Allies in the peace of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> and &s;o forced to re&s;tore what he had got from the <HI>Swedes,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> upon that gave him a great pen&s;ion, and made the Electore&s;s &s;uch pre|&s;ents, that he was prevailed on to enter into their intere&s;ts: And in this he made &s;ome ill &s;teps in the decline of his life. But nothing could &s;often him with relation to that Court, after they broke the edict of <HI>Nantes,</HI> and began the per&s;ecution of the Prote&s;tants. He took great care of all the Refugees. He &s;et men on the frontier of <HI>France</HI> to receive and defray them; and gave them all the marks of Chri&s;tian compa&s;&s;ion, and of a bounty becoming &s;o great a Prince. But his age and infirmi|ties,
<PB N="748" REF="766">
he being crippled with the gout, and the ill under&s;tanding that was between the Prince the Electoral and Electore&s;s, had &s;o disjointed his Court, that little was to be expected from him.</P>
<P>Death came upon him quicker than was looked for. He re|ceived the intimations of it with the firmne&s;s that became both a Chri&s;tian and a Hero. He gave his la&s;t advices to his &s;on, and to his Mini&s;ters, with a greatne&s;s and a tenderne&s;s that both &s;urpri&s;ed and melted them all: And above all other things he recommended to them the concerns of the Prote&s;tant Reli|gion, then in &s;uch an univer&s;al danger. His &s;on had not his genius. He had not a &s;trength of body nor a force of mind ca|pable of great matters. But he was filled with zeal for the Re|formed Religion: And he was at that time &s;o entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a confidence in the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and with a high e&s;teem of him, as he was his cou&s;in german, that we had a much better pro&s;pect of all our affairs by his &s;ucceeding his father. And this was encrea&s;ed by the great credit that <HI>Dan|kelman,</HI> who had been his Governor, continued to have with him: For he had true notions of the affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> and was a zealous Prote&s;tant, and was like to prove a very good Mi|ni&s;ter, tho' he was too ab&s;olute in his favour, and was too much &s;et on rai&s;ing his own family. All at the <HI>Hague</HI> were looking with great concern on the affairs of <HI>Europe;</HI> the&s;e be|ing, in many re&s;pects, and in many different places, brought to a very critical &s;tate.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now look back to <HI>England,</HI> where the Queen's deli|very <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen gave out $word$ &s;$$ was $line$</NOTE> was the &s;ubject of all men's di&s;cour&s;e. And &s;ince &s;o much depends on this, I will give as full and as di&s;tinct an account of all that related to that matter, as I could gather up either at that time or afterwards. The Queen had been for &s;ix or &s;even years in &s;uch an ill &s;tate of health, that every winter brought her very near death. Tho&s;e about her &s;eemed well a&s;&s;ured that &s;he, who had buried all her children &s;oon after they were born, and had now for &s;everal years cea&s;ed bearing, would have no more children. Her own Prie&s;ts apprehended it, and &s;eemed to wi&s;h for her death. She had great and frequent di&s;|tempers, that returned often, which put all people out of their hopes or fears of her having any children. Her &s;pirits were now much on the fret. She was eager in the pro&s;ecution of all the King's de&s;igns. It was believed, that &s;he had a main hand in driving him to them all. And he, perhaps to make her gent|ler to him in his vagrant amours, was more ea&s;y to her in every thing el&s;e. The Lady <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> was come back from <HI>Ireland:</HI> And the King went oft to her. But it was vi&s;ible, &s;he was
<PB N="749" REF="767">
not like to gain that credit in affairs, to which &s;he had a&s;pired: And therefore this was le&s;s con&s;idered.</P>
<P>She had another mortification, when <HI>Fitz-James</HI> the King's &s;on was made Duke of <HI>Berwick.</HI> He was a &s;oft and harmle&s;s young man, and was much beloved by the King: But the Queen's di&s;|like kept him from making any great figure. He made two campaigns in <HI>Hungary,</HI> that were little to his honour: For, as his Governor diverted the allowance that was given for keep|ing a table, and &s;ent him always to eat at other tables, &s;o, tho' in the &s;iege of <HI>Buda</HI> there were many occa&s;ions given him to have di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, yet he had appeared in none of them. There was more care taken of his per&s;on, than became his age and condition. Yet his Governor's brother was a Je&s;uit, and in the &s;ecret: So every thing was ventured on by him, and all was forgiven him.</P>
<P>In <HI>September,</HI> the former year, the Queen went to the <HI>Bath,</HI> where, as was already told, the King came and &s;aw her, and &s;taid a few days with her. She after that pur&s;ued a full cour&s;e of bathing: And, having re&s;olved to return in the end of <HI>Sep|tember,</HI> an accident took her to which the &s;ex is &s;ubject: And that made her &s;tay there a week longer. She came to <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> on the &s;ixth of <HI>October.</HI> It was &s;aid, that, at the very time of her coming to the King, her mother, the Duche&s;s of <HI>Modena,</HI> made a vow to the Lady <HI>Loretto,</HI> that her daughter might by her means have a &s;on. And it went current, that the Queen believed her|&s;elf to be with child in that very in&s;tant, in which her mother made her vow: Of which, &s;ome travellers have a&s;&s;ured me, there was a &s;olemn record made at <HI>Loretto.</HI> A conception &s;aid to be thus begun looked &s;u&s;picious. It was now fixed to the &s;ixth of <HI>October:</HI> So the nine months were to run to the &s;ixth of <HI>July.</HI> She was in the progre&s;s of her big belly let blood &s;everal times: And the mo&s;t a&s;tringent things that could be propo&s;ed were u&s;ed.</P>
<P>It was &s;oon ob&s;erved, that all things about her per&s;on were managed with a my&s;terious &s;ecrecy, into which none were admit|ted but a few Papi&s;ts. She was not dre&s;&s;ed nor undre&s;&s;ed with the u&s;ual ceremony. Prince <HI>George</HI> told me, that the Prince&s;s went as far in de&s;iring to be &s;atisfied by feeling the motion, after &s;he &s;aid &s;he was quick, as &s;he could go without breaking with her: And &s;he had &s;ometimes &s;taid by her even indecently long in mornings, to &s;ee her ri&s;e, and to give her her &s;hift: But &s;he never did either. She never offered any &s;atisfaction in that mat|ter by letter to the Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange,</HI> nor to any of the Ladies of quality, in who&s;e word the world would have acquie&s;ced. The thing upon this began to be &s;u&s;pected: And &s;ome libels were writ, treating the whole as an impo&s;ture. The u&s;e the Queen
<PB N="750" REF="768">
made of this was, to &s;ay, that &s;ince &s;he &s;aw &s;ome were &s;u&s;pect|ing her as capable of &s;o black a contrivance, &s;he &s;corned to &s;ati&s;|fy tho&s;e who could entertain &s;uch thoughts of her. How ju&s;t &s;oever this might be with relation to the libellers, yet certain|ly, if &s;he was truly with child, &s;he owed it to the King and her&s;elf, to the King's daughters, but mo&s;t of all to the infant &s;he carried in her belly, to give &s;uch rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction, as might put an end to jealou&s;y. This was in her power to do every day. And her not doing it gave ju&s;t grounds of &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>Things went thus on till <HI>Monday</HI> in <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> week. On that day the King went to <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> to &s;ee &s;ome of the naval preparations; but was &s;oon &s;ent for by the Queen, who apprehended &s;he was in danger of mi&s;carrying. Dr. <HI>Scarborough</HI> was come to <HI>Knights|bridge</HI> to &s;ee Bi&s;hop <HI>Ward,</HI> my predece&s;&s;or, who had been his antient friend, and was then his patient: But the Queen's coach was &s;ent to call him in all ha&s;te, &s;ince &s;he was near mi&s;carrying. Dr. <HI>Windebank,</HI> who knew nothing of this matter, &s;taid long that morning upon an appointment for Dr. <HI>Wallgrave,</HI> another of the Queen's phy&s;icians, who the next time he &s;aw him ex|cu&s;ed him&s;elf, for the Queen, he &s;aid, was then under the mo&s;t ap|parent &s;igns of mi&s;carrying. Of this the Doctor made oath: And it is yet extant.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame day the Counte&s;s of <HI>Clarendon,</HI> being to go out of town for a few days, came to &s;ee the Queen before &s;he went, knowing nothing of what had happen'd to her. And &s;he, be|ing a Lady of the Bed-chamber to Queen <HI>Dowager,</HI> did, accord|ing to the rule of the Court, go into the Queen's Bed-cham|ber without a&s;king admittance. She &s;aw the Queen a bed, be|moaning her&s;elf in a mo&s;t doleful manner, &s;aying often, <HI>Undone, Undone:</HI> And one that belonged to her carried &s;omewhat out of the bed, which &s;he believed was linen taken from the Queen. She was upon this in &s;ome confu&s;ion: And the Counte&s;s of <HI>Powis</HI> coming in, went to her, and &s;aid with &s;ome &s;harpne&s;s, what do you here? And carried her to the door. Before &s;he had got out of the Court, one of the Bed-chamber women followed her, and charged her not to &s;peak of any thing &s;he had &s;een that day. This matter, whatever was in it, was hu&s;hed up: And the Queen held on her cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s had mi&s;carried in the &s;pring. So, as &s;oon as &s;he had recovered her &s;trength, the King pre&s;&s;ed her to go to the <HI>Bath,</HI> &s;ince that had &s;o good an effect on the Queen. Some of her phy|&s;icians, and all her other friends, were again&s;t her going. <HI>Lower,</HI> one of her phy&s;icians told me, he was again&s;t it: He thought, &s;he was not &s;trong enough for the <HI>Bath,</HI> tho' the King pre&s;&s;ed it with an unu&s;ual vehemence. <HI>Millington,</HI> another phy&s;ician, told
<PB N="751" REF="769">
the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> from whom I had it, that he was pre&s;&s;ed to go to the Prince&s;s, and advi&s;e her to go to the <HI>Bath.</HI> The per|&s;on that &s;poke to him told him, the King was much &s;et on it, and that he expected it of him, that he would per&s;uade her to it. <HI>Millington</HI> an&s;wered, he would not advi&s;e a patient ac|cording to direction, but according to his own rea&s;on: So he would not go. <HI>Scarborough</HI> and <HI>Witherly</HI> took it upon them to advi&s;e it: So &s;he went thither in the end of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was gone, tho&s;e about the Queen did all of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's reckoning changed.</NOTE> the &s;udden change her reckoning, and began it from the King's being with her at <HI>Bath.</HI> This came on &s;o quick, that, tho' the Queen had &s;et the fourteenth of <HI>June</HI> for her going to <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> where &s;he intended to lie in, and all the preparations for the birth and for the child were ordered to be made ready by the end of <HI>June,</HI> yet now a re&s;olution was taken for the Queen's lying in at St. <HI>James</HI>'s; and directions were given to have all things quickly ready. The <HI>Bath</HI> water either did not agree with the Prince&s;s: Or the advices of her friends were &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, who thought her ab&s;ence from the Court at that time of &s;uch con&s;equence, that in compliance with them &s;he gave it out it did not, and that therefore &s;he would return in a few days.</P>
<P>The day after the Court had this notice, the Queen &s;aid, &s;he would go to St. <HI>James</HI>'s, and look for the good hour. She was often told, that it was impo&s;&s;ible upon &s;o &s;hort a warn|ing to have things ready. But &s;he was &s;o po&s;itive, that &s;he &s;aid, &s;he would lie there that night, tho' &s;he &s;hould lie upon the boards. And at night, tho' the &s;horter and quicker way was to go from <HI>Witehall</HI> to St. <HI>James</HI>'s thro' the Park, and &s;he always went that way, yet now, by a &s;ort of affectation, &s;he would be carried thither by <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s</HI> thro' the <HI>Pall-Mall.</HI> And it was given out by all her train, that &s;he was going to be deli|vered. Some &s;aid, it would be next morning: And the Prie&s;ts &s;aid very confidently, that it would be a boy.</P>
<P>The next morning, about nine a clock, &s;he &s;ent word to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen &s;aid to be $word$ labour.</NOTE> King, that &s;he was in labour. The Queen <HI>Dowager</HI> was next &s;ent to. But no Ladies were &s;ent for: So that no women were in the room, but two dre&s;&s;ers and one under dre&s;&s;er, and the mid|wife. The Earl of <HI>Arran</HI> &s;ent notice to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Sun|derland:</HI> So &s;he came. The Lady <HI>Bella&s;is</HI> came al&s;o in time. The Prote&s;tant Ladies that belonged to the Court were all gone to Church before the news was let go abroad: For it happen'd on <HI>Trinity Sunday,</HI> it being that year on the tenth of <HI>June.</HI> The King brought over with him from <HI>Whitehall</HI> a great many Peers and Privy Coun&s;ellors. And of the&s;e eighteen were let into the
<PB N="752" REF="770">
Bed-chamber: But they &s;tood at the furthe&s;t end of the room. The Ladies &s;tood within the alcove. The curtains of the bed were drawn clo&s;e, and none came within them, but the mid|wife, and an under dre&s;&s;er. The Queen lay all the while a bed: And, in order to the warming one &s;ide of it, a warming pan was brought. But it was not opened, that it might be &s;een that there was fire and nothing el&s;e in it: So here was matter for &s;u&s;picion, with which all people were filled.</P>
<P>A little before ten, the Queen cried out as in a &s;trong pain, <NOTE PLACE="marg">And deliver|ed of a &s;on.</NOTE> and immediately after the midwife &s;aid aloud, &s;he was happily brought to bed. When the Lords all cried out of what, the midwife an&s;wered, the Queen mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed: Only &s;he gave a &s;ign to the Counte&s;s of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> who upon that touch|ed her forehead, by which, it being the &s;ign before agreed on, the King &s;aid he knew it was a boy. No cries were heard from the child: Nor was it &s;hewed to tho&s;e in the room. It was pretended, more air was nece&s;&s;ary. The under dre&s;&s;er went out with the child, or &s;omewhat el&s;e, in her arms to a dre&s;&s;ing room, to which there was a door near the Queen's bed: But there was another entry to it from other apartments.</P>
<P>The King continued with the Lords in the Bed-chamber for &s;ome minutes, which was either a &s;ign of much phlegm upon <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great grounds of jealou&s;y ap|peared.</NOTE> &s;uch an occa&s;ion; for it was not known whether the child was alive or dead: Or it looked like the giving time for &s;ome ma|nagement. After a little while they went all into the dre&s;&s;ing room: And then the news was publi&s;hed. In the mean while, no body was called to lay their hands on the Queen's belly, in order to a full &s;atisfaction. When the Prince&s;s came to town three days after, &s;he had as little &s;atisfaction given her. <HI>Cham|berlain,</HI> the man midwife, who was always ordered to attend her labour before, and who brought the plai&s;ters for putting back the milk, wondered that he had not been &s;ent to. He went according to cu&s;tom with the plai&s;ters: But he was told they had no occa&s;ion for him. He fancied, that &s;ome other per&s;on was put in his place: But he could not find that any had it. All that concerned the milk, or the Queen's purgations, was managed &s;till in the dark. This made all people inclined more and more to believe, there was a ba&s;e impo&s;ture now put on the Nation. That &s;till increa&s;ed. That night one <HI>Hemings,</HI> a very worthy man, an Apothecary by his trade, who lived in St. <HI>Mar|tin</HI>'s <HI>Lane,</HI> the very next door to a family of an eminent Pa|pi&s;t: <HI>(Brown,</HI> brother to the Vi&s;count <HI>Montacute,</HI> lived there:) The wall between his parlour and theirs being &s;o thin, that he could ea&s;ily hear any thing that was &s;aid with a louder voice, he <HI>(Hemings)</HI> was reading in his parlour late at night, when he
<PB N="753" REF="771">
heard one coming into the neighbouring parlour, and &s;ay with a doleful voice, the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> is dead: Upon which a great many that lived in the hou&s;e came down &s;tairs very quick: Upon this confu&s;ion he could not hear any thing more; but it was plain, they were in a great con&s;ternation. He went with the news next morning to the Bi&s;hops in the Tower. The Coun|te&s;s of <HI>Clarendon</HI> came thither &s;oon after, and told them, &s;he had been at the young Prince's door, but was denied acce&s;s: She was amazed at it; and a&s;ked, if they knew her: They &s;aid, they did; but that the Queen had ordered, that no per|&s;on what&s;oever &s;hould be &s;uffered to come in to him. This gave credit to <HI>Heming</HI>'s &s;tory, and looked as if all was ordered to be kept &s;hut up clo&s;e, till another child was found. One, that &s;aw the child two days after, &s;aid to me, that he looked &s;trong, and not like a child &s;o newly born. <HI>Windebank</HI> met <HI>Walgrave</HI> the day after this birth, and remembred him of what he had told him eight weeks before. He acknowledged what he had &s;aid, but added, that God wrought miracles: To which no reply could, or dur&s;t be made by the other: It needed none. So healthy a child being &s;o little like any of tho&s;e the Queen had born, it was given out, that he had fits, and could not live. But tho&s;e who &s;aw him every day ob&s;erved no &s;uch thing. On the con|trary the child was in a very pro&s;perous &s;tate. None of tho&s;e fits ever happen'd, when the Prince&s;s was at Court; for &s;he could not be denied admittance, tho' all others were. So this was believed to be given out to make the matter more credible. It is true, &s;ome weeks after that, the Court being gone to <HI>$span$nd|&s;or,</HI> and the child &s;ent to <HI>Richmond,</HI> he fell into &s;uch fits, that four phy&s;icians were &s;ent for. They all looked on him as a dying child. The King and Queen were &s;ent for. The phy|&s;icians <NOTE PLACE="marg">The child, as was believ|ed, died, and another was put in his room.</NOTE> went to a dinner prepared for them; and were often won|dring that they were not called for. They took it for grant|ed, that the child was dead. But, when they went in after din|ner to look on him, they &s;aw a &s;ound healthy child, that &s;eem|ed to have had no &s;ort of illne&s;s on him. It was &s;aid, that the child was &s;trangely revived of a &s;udden. Some of the phy&s;ici|ans told <HI>Lloyd,</HI> Bi&s;hop of St. <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> that it was not po&s;&s;ible for them to think it was the &s;ame child. They looked on one ano|ther, but dur&s;t not &s;peak what they thought.</P>
<P>Thus I have related &s;uch particulars as I could gather of this birth: To which &s;ome more &s;hall be added, when I give an account of the proof that the King brought afterwards to put this matter out of doubt; but by which it became indeed more doubtful than ever. I took mo&s;t of the&s;e from the informati|ons that were &s;ent over to the Prince and Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange,</HI>
<PB N="754" REF="772">
as I had many from the vouchers them&s;elves. I do not mix with the&s;e the various reports that were, both then and af|terwards, &s;pread of this matter, of which Bi&s;hop <HI>Lloyd</HI> has a great collection, mo&s;t of them well atte&s;ted. What truth &s;o|ever may be in the&s;e, this is certain, that the method in which this matter was conducted from fir&s;t to la&s;t was very unaccounta|ble. If an impo&s;ture had been intended, it could not have been otherwi&s;e managed. The pretended excu&s;e that the Queen made, that &s;he owed no &s;atisfaction to tho&s;e who could &s;u&s;pect her capable of &s;uch ba&s;e forgery, was the only excu&s;e that &s;he could have made, if it had been really what it was commonly &s;aid to be. She &s;eemed to be &s;oon recovered, and was &s;o little altered by her labour, either in her looks or voice, that this helped not a little to encrea&s;e jealou&s;ies. The rejoycings over <HI>England</HI> upon this birth were very cold and forced. Bonefires were made in &s;ome places, and a &s;et of congratulatory addre&s;&s;es went round the Nation. None dur&s;t oppo&s;e them. But all was formal, and only to make a &s;hew.</P>
<P>The Prince and Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange</HI> received the news of this birth very decently. The fir&s;t letters gave not tho&s;e grounds of &s;u&s;picion <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince and Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange</HI> &s;ent to con|gratulate.</NOTE> that were &s;ent to them afterwards. So they &s;ent over <HI>Zuyle&s;tein</HI> to congratulate: And the Prince&s;s ordered the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> to be prayed for in her Chapel. Upon this occa&s;ion, it may not be im|proper to &s;et down what the Prince&s;s &s;aid to my &s;elf on this &s;ubject two years before. I had a&s;ked her, in the freedom of much di&s;cour&s;e, if &s;he knew the temper of her own mind, and how &s;he could bear the Queen's having a &s;on. She &s;aid, &s;he was &s;ure it would give her no concern at all on her own ac|count: God knew be&s;t what was fit for her: And, if it was not to &s;erve the great ends of providence, &s;he was &s;ure that, as to her &s;elf, &s;he would rather wi&s;h to live and die in the con|dition &s;he was then in. The adverti&s;ements formerly mention|ed came over from &s;o many hands, that it was impo&s;&s;ible not to be &s;haken by them. It was al&s;o taken ill in <HI>England,</HI> that the Prince&s;s &s;hould have begun &s;o early to pray for the pretend|ed Prince: Upon which the naming him di&s;continued. But this was &s;o highly re&s;ented by the Court of <HI>England,</HI> that the Prince, fearing it might precipitate a rupture, ordered him to be again named in the prayers.</P>
<P>The Prince &s;et him&s;elf with great application to prepare for <NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ Prince $span$</NOTE> the intended expedition: For <HI>Zuyle&s;tein</HI> brought him &s;uch po|&s;itive advices, and &s;uch an a&s;&s;urance of the invitation he had de|&s;ired, that he was fully fixed in his purpo&s;e. It was advi&s;ed from <HI>England,</HI> that the Prince could never hope for a more fa|vourable conjuncture, nor for better grounds to break on, than
<PB N="755" REF="773">
he had at that time. The whole Nation was in a high fer|mentation. The proceedings again&s;t the Bi&s;hops, and tho&s;e that were &s;till kept on foot again&s;t the Clergy, made all people think the ruin of the Church was re&s;olved on, and that on the fir&s;t occa&s;ion it would be executed, and that the Religi|on would be altered. The pretended birth made them reckon that Popery and Slavery would be entailed on the Nation. And, if this heat went off, people would lo&s;e heart. It was al&s;o vi|&s;ible, that the Army continued well affected. They &s;poke open|ly again&s;t Popery: They drank the mo&s;t reproachful healths again&s;t them that could be invented, and treated the few Papi&s;ts that were among them with &s;corn and aver&s;ion. The King &s;aw this &s;o vi&s;ibly, that he broke up the camp, and &s;ent them to their quarters: And it was believed, that he would bring them no more together, till they were modelled more to his mind. The &s;eamen &s;hewed the &s;ame inclinations. The <HI>Dutch</HI> had &s;et out a fleet of twenty four men of war, on pretence to &s;ecure their trade: So the King re&s;olved to &s;et out as &s;trong a fleet. <HI>Strickland,</HI> who was a Papi&s;t, had the command. He brought &s;ome Prie&s;ts aboard with him, who &s;aid Ma&s;s, or at lea&s;t performed &s;uch offices of their Religion as are allowed on &s;hips of war: And the Chaplain, that was to &s;erve the Prote&s;|tants in <HI>Strickland</HI>'s &s;hip, was &s;ent away upon a &s;light pretence. This put the whole Fleet into &s;uch a di&s;order, that it was like to end in a mutiny. <HI>Strickland</HI> puni&s;hed &s;ome for this: And the King came down to accommodate the matter. He &s;poke very &s;oftly to the &s;eamen: Yet this made no great impre&s;&s;ion: For they hated Popery in general, and <HI>Strickland</HI> in particular. When &s;ome gained per&s;ons among the &s;eamen tried their affections to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> it appeared they had no inclinations to make war on them. They &s;aid aloud, they were their friends and their brethren; but they would very willingly go again&s;t the <HI>French.</HI> The King &s;aw all this, and was re&s;olved to take other more moderate mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The&s;e advices were &s;ugge&s;ted by the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> who <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sunderland</HI> advi&s;ed more $word$ rate pro|ceedings.</NOTE> &s;aw the King was running violently to his own ruin. So, as &s;oon as the Queen admitted men to audiences, he had &s;ome very long ones of her. He repre&s;ented to her, that the &s;tate of her affairs was quite changed by her having a &s;on. There was no need of driving things fa&s;t, now they had a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;ure: Time would bring all about, if matters were but &s;oftly managed. He told her, it would become her to &s;et up for the author of gentle coun&s;els, that the might by another admi|ni&s;tration lay the flame that was now kindled. By this &s;he would gain the hearts of the Nation, both to her &s;elf and to her &s;on:
<PB N="756" REF="774">
She might be declared Regent, in ca&s;e the King &s;hould die be|fore her &s;on came to be of age. He found the&s;e advices be|gan to be hearkned to. But, that he might have the more cre|dit in pre&s;&s;ing them, he, who had but too &s;light notions of re|ligion, re&s;olved to declare him&s;elf a Papi&s;t. And then, he be|ing in the &s;ame intere&s;t with her, and mo&s;t violently hated for this ill &s;tep he had made, he gained &s;uch an a&s;cendant over her &s;pirit, that things were like to be put in another manage|ment.</P>
<P>He made the &s;tep to Popery all of the &s;udden, without any <NOTE PLACE="marg">And he turned Pa|pi&s;t.</NOTE> previous in&s;truction or conference: So that the change he made looked too like a man who, having no religion, took up one, rather for to &s;erve a turn, than that he was truly changed from one religion to another. He has been &s;ince accu&s;ed, as if he had done all this to gain the more credit, that &s;o he might the more effectually ruin the King. There was a &s;u&s;picion of ano|ther nature, that &s;tuck with &s;ome in <HI>England,</HI> who thought that Mr. <HI>Sidney,</HI> who had the &s;ecret of all the corre&s;pondence that was between the Prince and his party in <HI>England,</HI> being in particular friend&s;hip with the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> the Earl had got into that &s;ecret: And they fancied he would get into the Prince's confidence by <HI>Sidney</HI>'s means. So I was writ to, and de&s;ired to put it home to the Prince, whether he was in any confidence or corre&s;pondence with the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> or not? For, till they were &s;atisfied in that matter, they would not go on; &s;ince they believed he would betray all, when things were ripe for it, and that many were engaged in the de&s;ign. The Prince upon that did &s;ay very po&s;itively, that he was in no &s;ort of corre&s;pondence with him. His coun&s;els lay then another way. And, if time had been given him to follow the &s;cheme then laid down by him, things might have turned fa|tally: And the Nation might have been &s;o laid a&s;leep with new promi&s;es, and a different conduct, that in a &s;low method they might have gained that, which they were &s;o near lo&s;ing by the violent proceedings in which they had gone &s;o far. The Judges had orders in their circuits to proceed very gently, and to give new promi&s;es in the King's name. But they were treated every where with &s;uch contempt, that the common decencies were &s;carce paid them, when they were on the bench. And they now &s;aw that the pre&s;entments of Grand Juries, and the verdicts of other Juries, were no more under their direction. Things &s;lept in <HI>England,</HI> as is u&s;ual, during the long vacation. But the Court had little quiet, having every day fre&s;h alarms from abroad, as well as great mortifications at home.</P>
<P><PB N="757" REF="775">
I mu&s;t now change the &s;cene, and give a large account of the affairs abroad, they having &s;uch a connection with all that followed in <HI>England.</HI> Upon the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI>'s death, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> treats with &s;$me Princes of $span$</NOTE> the-Prince &s;ent Mr. <HI>Bentink</HI> with the compliment to the new Elector: And he was ordered to lay before him the &s;tate of af|fairs, and to communicate the Prince's de&s;ign to him, and to a&s;k him, how much he might depend upon him for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The an&s;wer was full and frank. He offered all that was a&s;ked, and more. The Prince re&s;olved to carry over to <HI>England</HI> an Army of nine thou&s;and foot, and four thou&s;and hor&s;e and dragoons. He intended to choo&s;e the&s;e out of the whole <HI>Dutch</HI> Army. But for the &s;ecurity of the States, under &s;uch a diminution of their force, it was nece&s;&s;ary to have a &s;trength from &s;ome other Princes. This was &s;oon concerted between the Prince and the new Elector, with the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Lunenburg</HI> and <HI>Zell,</HI> who had a particular af|fection to the Prince, and was a cordial friend to him on all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>His brother, the Duke of <HI>Hannover,</HI> was at that time in &s;ome engagements with the Court of <HI>France.</HI> But, &s;ince he had mar|ried the Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia</HI> of the <HI>Palatine</HI> Hou&s;e, I ventured to &s;end a me&s;&s;age to her by one of their Court, who was then at the <HI>Hague.</HI> He was a <HI>French</HI> Refugee, named Mr. <HI>Boucour.</HI> It was to acquaint her with our de&s;ign with relation to <HI>England,</HI> and to let her know, that, if we &s;ucceeded, certainly a perpetual exclu&s;ion of all Papi&s;ts from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Crown would be enacted: And, &s;ince &s;he was the next Prote&s;tant heir after the two Prince&s;&s;es, and the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> of whom at that time there was no i&s;&s;ue alive, I was very confident, that, if the Duke of <HI>Hannover</HI> could be di&s;engaged from the intere&s;ts of <HI>France,</HI> &s;o that he came into our intere&s;ts, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Crown would be lodged in her per&s;on, and in her po&s;terity; tho' on the other hand, if he continued, as he &s;tood then, engaged with <HI>France,</HI> I could not an&s;wer for this. The Gentleman carried the me&s;&s;age, and delivered it. The Duche&s;s entertained it with much warmth: And brought him to the Duke to repeat it to him. But at that time this made no great impre&s;&s;ion on him. He looked on it as a remote and a doubtful project. Yet when he &s;aw our &s;ucce&s;s in <HI>England,</HI> he had other thoughts of it. Some days after this <HI>Frenchman</HI> was gone, I told the Prince what I had done. He approved of it heartily: But was parti|cularly glad, that I had done it, as of my &s;elf, without com|municating it to him, or any way engaging him in it: For he &s;aid, if it &s;hould happen to be known that the propo&s;ition was made by him, it might do us hurt in <HI>England,</HI> as if he had al|ready
<PB N="758" REF="776">
reckoned him&s;elf &s;o far ma&s;ter, as to be forming pro|jects concerning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Crown.</P>
<P>But while this was in a &s;ecret management, the Elector of <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> <HI>Colen</HI>'s death came in very luckily to give a good colour to in|trigues and preparations. The old Elector was brother to <HI>Maxi|milian,</HI> Duke of <HI>Bavaria.</HI> He had been long Bi&s;hop, both of <HI>Colen</HI> and <HI>$span$ge:</HI> He was al&s;o elected Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter:</HI> But the Pope would never grant his Bulls for that See: But he had the temporalties, and that was all he thought on. He had thus a revenue of near four millions of Guilders, and four great Bi|&s;hopricks; for he was likewi&s;e Bi&s;hop of <HI>Hilde&s;heim.</HI> He could arm and pay twenty thou&s;and men, be&s;ides that his dominions lay quite round the <HI>Netherlands. Mun&s;ter</HI> lay between them and the Northern parts of <HI>Germany;</HI> and from thence their be&s;t recruits came. <HI>Colen</HI> commanded twenty leagues of the <HI>Rhine;</HI> by which, as an entrance was opened into <HI>Holland,</HI> which they had felt &s;everely in the year 1672, &s;o the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands</HI> were entirely cut off from all a&s;&s;i&s;tance that might be &s;ent them out of <HI>Germany:</HI> And <HI>Liege</HI> was a country full both of people and wealth, by which an entrance is open into <HI>Brabant:</HI> And if <HI>Ma&s;tretcht</HI> was taken, the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> was open down to <HI>Holland.</HI> So it was of great importance to the States to take care who &s;hould &s;ucceed him. The old man was a weak Prince, much &s;et on chymical proce&s;&s;es, in hopes of the Philo&s;opher's &s;tone. He had taken one of the Princes of <HI>Fur&s;tenberg</HI> into his parti|cular confidence, and was entirely governed by him. He made him one of the Canons of <HI>Colen:</HI> And he came to be Dean at la&s;t. He made him not only his chief Mini&s;ter, but left the nomination of the Canons that were preferred by him wholly to his choice. The Bi&s;hop, and the Dean and Chapter, name tho&s;e by turns. So, what by tho&s;e the Elector named on his motion, what by tho&s;e he got to be cho&s;en, he reckoned he was &s;ure of &s;ucceeding the Elector: And nothing but ill ma|nagement could have prevented it. He had no hopes of &s;uc|ceeding at <HI>Mun&s;ter.</HI> But he had taken much pains to &s;ecure <HI>Liege.</HI></P>
<P>I need not enlarge further on this &s;tory, than to remem|ber that he got the Elector to deliver his Country up to the $span$ the year 1672, and that the treaty opened at <HI>Colen</HI> $span$n up on his being &s;eized by the Emperor's order. Af|$span$ was &s;et at liberty, he was, upon the recommendation of the $word$ of <HI>France,</HI> made a Cardinal, tho' with much difficul|ty. In the former winter, the Emperor had been prevailed on by the <HI>$span$</HI> Family to con&s;ent to the election of a C$span$ $word$ $word$. But this was an artifice of the Cardinal$$$, who
<PB N="759" REF="777">
deceived that family into the hopes of carrying the election for one of their branches. And they obtained the Emperor's con&s;ent to it, without which it could not be done. But &s;o ill grounded were the <HI>Palatine</HI>'s hopes, that of twenty five voices the Cardinal had nineteeen, and they had only &s;ix voices.</P>
<P>The conte&s;t at <HI>Rome</HI> about the Franchi&s;es had now occa&s;i|oned &s;uch a rupture there, that <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> &s;eemed to be in a &s;tate of war. The Count <HI>Lavardin</HI> was &s;ent Emba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Rome.</HI> But the Pope refu&s;ed to receive him, unle&s;s he would renounce the preten&s;ion to the Franchi&s;es. So he enterd <HI>Rome</HI> in a ho&s;tile manner, with &s;ome troops of hor&s;e, tho' not in form of troops: But the force was too great for the Pope. He kept guards about his hou&s;e, and in the Franchi&s;es, and affront|ed the Pope's authority on all occa&s;ions. The Pope bore all &s;ilently; but would never admit him to an audience, nor re|ceive any me&s;&s;age nor interce&s;&s;ion from the Court of <HI>France;</HI> and kept off every thing, in which they concerned them&s;elves: And therefore he would not confirm the election of a Coadjutor to <HI>Colen.</HI> So, that not being done when the Elector died, the Canons were to proceed to a new election, the former being void, becau&s;e not confirmed: For if it had been confirmed, there would have been no vacancy.</P>
<P>The cabal again&s;t the Cardinal grew &s;o &s;trong, that he be|gan to apprehend he might lo&s;e it, if he had not leave from the Pope to re&s;ign the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Strasburg,</HI> which the <HI>French</HI> had forced him to accept, only to le&s;&s;en the pen&s;ion that they paid him by giving him that Bi&s;hoprick. By the rules of the Empire, a man that is already a Bi&s;hop, cannot be cho&s;en to another See, but by a po&s;tulation: And to that it is nece&s;&s;ary to have a concurrence of two thirds of the Chapter. But it was at the Pope's choice, whether he would accept of the re|&s;ignation of <HI>Strasburg,</HI> or not: And therefore he refu&s;ed it. The King of <HI>France</HI> &s;ent a Gentleman to the Pope with a letter writ in his own hand, de&s;iring him to accept of that re&s;ignation, and promi&s;ing him upon it all rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction: But the Pope would not admit the bearer, nor receive the letter. He &s;aid, while the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador lived at <HI>Rome</HI> like an ene|my, that had invaded it, he would receive nothing from that Court.</P>
<P>In the Bi&s;hopricks of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Hilde&s;heim,</HI> the Deans were promoted, of whom both the States and the Princes of the Em|pire were well a&s;&s;ured. But a new management was &s;et up at $word$. The Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> had been di&s;gu&s;ted at &s;ome things in the Emperor's Court. He complained, that the honour of the &s;ucce&s;s in <HI>Hungary</HI> was given &s;o entirely to the Duke
<PB N="760" REF="778">
of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> that he had not the &s;hare which belonged to him. The <HI>French</HI> in&s;truments that were then about him took occa&s;i|on to alienate him more from the Emperor, by repre&s;enting to him, that, in the management now at <HI>C$len,</HI> the Emperor &s;hewed more regard to the <HI>Palatine</HI> Family than to him&s;elf, after all the &s;ervice he had done him. The Emperor, appre|hending the ill con&s;equences of a breach with him, &s;ent and offered him the &s;upream command of his Armies in <HI>Hungary</HI> for that year, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> being taken ill of a fever, ju&s;t as they were upon opening the Campaign. He likewi&s;e offered him all the voices that the <HI>Palatine</HI> had made at <HI>Colen,</HI> in favour of his brother Prince <HI>Clement.</HI> Upon this they were again reconciled: And the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> commanded the Emperor's Army in <HI>Hungary</HI> &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that he took <HI>Bel|grade</HI> by &s;torm after a &s;hort &s;iege. Prince <HI>Clement</HI> was then but &s;eventeen, and was not of the Chapter of <HI>Colen.</HI> So he was not eligible according to their rules, till he obtained a Bull from the Pope di&s;pen&s;ing with the&s;e things. That was ea&s;ily got&punc; With it the Emperor &s;ent one to manage the election in his name, with expre&s;s in&s;tructions to offer the Chapter the whole reve|nue and government of the temporalties for five years, in ca&s;e they would choo&s;e Prince <HI>Clement,</HI> who wanted all that time to be of age. If he could make nine voices &s;ure for him, he was to &s;tick firm to his intere&s;t. But, if he could not gain &s;o many, he was to con&s;ent to any per&s;on that &s;hould be &s;et up in oppo&s;ition to the Cardinal. He was ordered to charge him &s;everely before the Chapter, as one that had been for many years an enemy and traitor to the Empire. This was done with all po&s;&s;ible aggravations, and in very injurious words.</P>
<P>The Chapter &s;aw, that this election was like to be attended with a war in their Country, and other di&s;mal con&s;equences: For the Cardinal was cho&s;en by the Chapter Vicar, or Guardian of the temporalties: And he had put garri&s;ons in all their for|tified places, that were paid with <HI>French</HI> money: And they knew, he would put them all in the King of <HI>France</HI>'s hands, $span$ was not elected. They had promi&s;ed not to vote in fa|$span$ of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Prince. So they offered to the Emperor's $span$ to con&s;ent to any third per&s;on. But ten voices were $span$ <HI>Clement:</HI> So he was fixed to his int$$$&s;t$&punc; $span$ion, the Cardinal had fourteen voices, and P$span$ ten. By this means the Cardinal's po&s;tulation was $span$ &s;ince he had not two thirds. And upon that Prince $span$ was fir&s;t judged good by the Emperor as to $span$ but was tran&s;mitted by him to <HI>R$span$</HI> where $span$gation of Cardinals examined it: And it was judged $word$
<PB N="761" REF="779">
favour of Prince <HI>Clement.</HI> The Cardinal &s;ucceeded wor&s;e at <HI>Liege,</HI> where the Dean was without any difficulty cho&s;en Bi&s;hop: And nothing but the Cardinal's purple &s;aved him from the vio|lences of the people of <HI>Liege.</HI> He met with all &s;orts of inju|rious u&s;age, being hated there, both on the account of his de|pending &s;o much on the protection of <HI>France,</HI> and for the ef|fects they had felt of his violent and cruel Mini&s;try under the old Elector. I will add one circum&s;tance in honour of &s;ome of the Canons of <HI>Liege.</HI> They not only would accept of no pre|&s;ents from tho&s;e whom the States appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t in manage|ing that election, before it was made; but they refu&s;ed them af|ter the election was over. This I &s;aw in the letter that the States Deputy wrote to the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P>I have given a more particular account of this matter; be|cau&s;e I was acquainted with all the &s;teps that were made in it. And it had &s;uch an immediate relation to the peace and &s;afety of <HI>Holland,</HI> that, if they had mi&s;carried in it, the expedition de&s;igned for <HI>England</HI> would not have been &s;o &s;afe, nor could it have been propo&s;ed ea&s;ily in the States. By this it appeared, what an influence the Papacy, low as it is, may &s;till have in the matters of the greate&s;t con&s;equence. The fooli&s;h pride of the <HI>French</HI> Court, which had affronted the Pope, in a point in which, &s;ince they allowed him to be the Prince of <HI>Rome,</HI> he certainly could lay down &s;uch rules as he thought fit, did now defeat a de&s;ign that they had been long driving at, and which could not have mi&s;carried by any other means, than tho&s;e that they had found out. Such great events may and do often ri&s;e from incon&s;iderable beginnings. The&s;e things furni&s;hed the Prince with a good blind for covering all his preparations; &s;ince here a war in their neighbourhood was unavoidable, and it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trengthen both their alliances and their troops. For it was vi&s;ible to all the world, that, if the <HI>French</HI> could have fixed them&s;elves in the territory of <HI>Colen,</HI> the way was opened to enter <HI>Holland,</HI> or to &s;eize on <HI>Flanders,</HI> when the King plea&s;ed; and he would have the four Electors on the <HI>Rhme</HI> at mercy. It was nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;lodge them, and this could not be done without a war with <HI>France.</HI> The Prince got the States to &s;ettle a fund for nine thou&s;and &s;eamen to be con&s;tantly in their &s;ervice. And orders were given to put the naval prepara|tions in &s;uch a ca&s;e, that they might be ready to put to &s;ea upon orders. Thus things went on in <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> with &s;o much &s;ecrecy and &s;o little &s;u&s;picion, that neither the Court of <HI>England</HI> nor the Court of <HI>France</HI> &s;eemed to be alarmed at them.</P>
<P><PB N="762" REF="780">
In <HI>July,</HI> Admiral <HI>Herbert</HI> came over to <HI>Holland,</HI> and was re|ceived with a particular regard to his pride and ill humour: For he was upon every occa&s;ion &s;o &s;ullen and peevi&s;h, that it was <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Herbart</HI> came over to <HI>Holland.</HI></NOTE> plain he &s;et a high value on him&s;elf, and expected the &s;ame of all others. He had got his accounts pa&s;t, in which he com|plained, that the King had u&s;ed him not only hardly but un|ju&s;tly. He was a man delivered up to pride and luxury. Yet he had a good under&s;tanding: And he had gained &s;o great a reputation by his &s;teady behaviour in <HI>England,</HI> that the Prince un|der&s;tood that it was expected he &s;hould u&s;e him as he him&s;elf &s;hould de&s;ire; in which it was not very ea&s;y to him to con&s;train him|&s;elf &s;o far as that required. The managing him was in a great mea&s;ure put on me: And it was no ea&s;y thing. It made me often reflect on the providence of God, that makes &s;ome men in&s;truments in great things, to which they them&s;elves have no &s;ort of affection or di&s;po&s;ition: For his private quarrel with the Lord <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> who he thought had more of the King's confidence than he him&s;elf had, was believed the root of all the $ullenne&s;s he fell under towards the King, and of all the firm|ne&s;s that grew out of that.</P>
<P>I now return to <HI>England,</HI> to give an account of a &s;ecret ma|nagement <NOTE PLACE="marg">The advices from <HI>Eng|land.</HI> The Lord <HI>$word$</HI>'s character.</NOTE> there. The Lord <HI>Mordaunt</HI> was the fir&s;t of all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility that came over openly to &s;ee the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> He a&s;ked the King's leave to do it. He was a man of much heat, many notions, and full of di&s;cour&s;e: He was brave and generous: But had not true judgment: His thoughts were crude and indige&s;ted: And his &s;ecrets were &s;oon known. He was with the Prince in the year 1686: And then he pre&s;&s;ed him to undertake the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>England:</HI> And he repre&s;ented the matter as &s;o ea&s;y, that this appeared too romantical to the Prince to build upon it. He only promi&s;ed in general, that he &s;hould have an eye on the affairs of <HI>England;</HI> and &s;hould en|deavour to put the affairs of <HI>Holland</HI> in &s;o good a po&s;ture, as to be ready to act when it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary: And he a&s;&s;ur|ed him, that, if the King &s;hould go about either to change the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, or to wrong the Prince&s;s in her right, or to $word$ forged plots to de&s;troy his friends, that he would try what he could po&s;&s;ibly do. Next year a man of a far different temper came over to him:</P>
<P>The $word$ of <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI> He had been bred a Papi&s;t, but had for&s;aken that religion upon a very critical and anxious en|quiry <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> into matters of controver&s;y. Some thought, that, tho' he had for&s;aken Popery, he was two &s;ceptical, and too little fixed in the points of religion. He &s;eemed to be a man of great probity, and to have a high &s;en&s;e of honour. He had
<PB N="763" REF="781">
no ordinary mea&s;ure of learning, a correct judgment, with a &s;weetne&s;s of temper that charmed all who knew him. He had at that time ju&s;t notions of government; and &s;o great a com|mand of him&s;elf, that, during all the time that he continued in the Mini&s;try, I never heard any one complaint of him, but for his &s;ilent and re&s;erved an&s;wers, with which his friends were not always well plea&s;ed. His mode&s;t deportment gave him &s;uch an intere&s;t in the Prince, that he never &s;eemed &s;o fond of any of his Mini&s;ters, as he was of him. He had only in general laid the &s;tate of affairs before the Prince, without pre&s;&s;ing him too much.</P>
<P>But <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> coming over in <HI>May</HI> brought the matter nearer a <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> point. He was a cou&s;in german to the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el.</HI> He had been bred at &s;ea, and was Bed-chamber-man to the King, when he was Duke of <HI>York:</HI> But, upon the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s death, he retired from the Court. He was a man of much honour, and great courage. He had good principles, and was firm to them. The Prince &s;poke more po&s;itively to him, than he had ever done before. He &s;aid, he mu&s;t &s;atisfy both his honour and con&s;cience, before he could enter upon &s;o great a de&s;ign, which, if it mi&s;carried, mu&s;t bring ruin both on <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland:</HI> He prote&s;ted, that no private ambition nor re&s;entment of his own could ever prevail &s;o far with him, as to make him break with &s;o near a relation, or engage in a war, of which the con|&s;equences mu&s;t be of the la&s;t importance both to the intere&s;ts of <HI>Europe</HI> and of the Prote&s;tant Religion: Therefore he expect|ed formal and direct invitations. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> laid before him the dan|ger of tru&s;ting &s;uch a &s;ecret to great numbers. The Prince &s;aid, if a con&s;iderable number of men, that might be &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand the &s;en&s;e of the Nation be&s;t, &s;hould do it, he would acquie&s;ce in it.</P>
<P><HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> told me, that, upon his return to <HI>England,</HI> he com|municated the matter, fir&s;t to the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and then to the Lord <HI>Luinly,</HI> who was a late convert from Popery, and had &s;tood out very firmly all this reign. He was a man, who laid his intere&s;t much to heart: And he re&s;olved to embark deep in this de&s;ign.</P>
<P>But the man in who&s;e hands the conduct of the whole de|&s;ign <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> was chiefly depo&s;ited, by the Prince's own order, was Mr. <HI>Sidney,</HI> brother to the Earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> and to <HI>Algernoon Sidney.</HI> He was a graceful man, and had lived long in the Court, where he had &s;ome adventures that became very publick. He was a man of a &s;weet and carre&s;&s;ing temper, had no malice in his heart, but too great a love of plea&s;ure. He had been &s;ent $word$|voy to <HI>Holland</HI> in the year 1679, where he entred into &s;uch par|ticular
<PB N="764" REF="782">
confidences with the Prince, that he had the highe&s;t mea&s;ure of his tru&s;t and favour that any <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> ever had. This was well known over <HI>England:</HI> So that all who de&s;ired to recommend them&s;elves to the Prince did it thro' his hands. He was &s;o apprehen&s;ive of the dangers this might ca&s;t him in, that he travelled almo&s;t a year round <HI>Italy.</HI> But now matters ripen|ed fa&s;ter: So all centered in him. But, becau&s;e he was lazy, and the bu&s;ine&s;s required an active man, who could both run about, and write over long and full accounts of all matters, I recommended a kin&s;man of my own, <HI>John&s;toune,</HI> whom I had formed, and knew to be both faithful and diligent, and very fit for the employment he was now tru&s;ted with.</P>
<P><HI>Sidney</HI> tried the Marquis of <HI>Hallifax,</HI> if he would advi&s;e the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Many en|gaged in the de&s;ign.</NOTE> Prince's coming over. But, as this matter was opened to him at a great di&s;tance, he did not encourage a further freedom. He looked on the thing as impracticable: It depended on &s;o many accidents, that he thought it was a ra&s;h and de&s;perate project, that ventured all upon &s;uch a dangerous i&s;&s;ue, as might turn on &s;eas and winds. It was next opened to the Earl of <HI>Danby:</HI> And he not only went in heartily to it him&s;elf, but drew in the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> to join in it. By their advice it was propo&s;ed to the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> who had great credit with the whole Church party: For he was a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with their notions, and was grave and vertuous in the cour&s;e of his life. He had &s;ome knowledge of the law, and of the records of Parliament, and was a copious Speaker, but too florid and tedious. He was much admired by many. He had &s;tood at a great di&s;tance from the Court all this reign: For, tho his name was &s;till among the Privy Coun&s;ellors, yet he never went to the board. He upon the fir&s;t propo&s;ition entertained it, and agreed to it. But at their next meeting he &s;aid, he had con&s;idered better of that matter: His con&s;cience was &s;o re&s;trained in tho&s;e points, that he could not go further with them in it: He &s;aid, he had talk|ed with &s;ome Divines, and named <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> and <HI>Stillingfleet,</HI> in general of the thing, and they were not &s;atisfied with it: (Tho' they prote&s;ted to me afterwards, that they remembred no &s;uch thing:) He confe&s;&s;ed, he &s;hould not have &s;uffered them to go &s;o far with him in &s;uch a &s;ecret, till he had examined it better: They had now, according to <HI>Italian</HI> notions, a right to murder him: But, tho' his principles re&s;trained him, &s;o that he could not go on with them, his affections would make him to wi&s;h well to them, and be &s;o far a criminal as concealment could make him one. The Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> was &s;poke to. And he went into it with great re&s;olution. It was next pro|po&s;ed to three of the chief Officers of the Army, <HI>Trelawny,
<PB N="765" REF="783">
Kirk,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Churchill.</HI> The&s;e went all into it. And <HI>Trelawny</HI> engaged his brother, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> into it.</P>
<P>But, having now named the Lord <HI>Churchill,</HI> who is like to be <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord <HI>Churchill</HI>'s character</NOTE> mentioned oft by me in the &s;equel of this work, I will &s;ay a little more of him. He was a man of a noble and graceful ap|pearance, bred up in the Court with no literature: But he had a &s;olid and clear under&s;tanding, with a con&s;tant pre&s;ence of mind. He knew the arts of living in a Court beyond any man in it. He care&s;&s;ed all people with a &s;oft and obliging deportment, and was always ready to do good offices. He had no fortune to &s;et up on: This put him on all the methods of acquiring one. And that went &s;o far into him, that he did not &s;hake it off, when he was in a much higher elevation: Nor was his ex|pence &s;uited enough to his po&s;ts. But, when allowances are made for that, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that he is one of the great|e&s;t men the age has produced. He was in high favour with the King. But his Lady was much more in Prince&s;s <HI>Anne</HI>'s favour. She had an a&s;cendant over her in every thing. She was a woman of little knowledge, but of a clear apprehen&s;ion, and a true judgment, a warm and hearty friend, violent and &s;udden in her re&s;olutions, and impetuous in her way of &s;peak|ing. She was thought proud and in&s;olent on her favour, tho' &s;he u&s;ed none of the common arts of a Court to maintain it: For &s;he did not be&s;et the Prince&s;s, nor flatter her. She &s;taid much at home, and looked very carefully after the education of her children. Having thus opened both their characters, I will now give an account of this Lord's engagements in this matter; for which he has been &s;o &s;everely cen&s;ured, as guil|ty both of ingratitude and treachery to a very kind and liberal ma&s;ter. He never di&s;covered any of the King's &s;ecrets; nor did he ever pu&s;h him on to any violent proceedings. So that he was in no contrivance to ruin or betray him. On the contrary, when|&s;oever he &s;poke to the King of his affairs, which he did but &s;eldom, becau&s;e he could not fall in with the King's notions, he always &s;ugge&s;ted moderate coun&s;els. The Earl of <HI>Gallway</HI> told me, that when he came over with the fir&s;t compliment upon the King's coming to the Crown, he &s;aid then to him, that, if the King was ever prevailed on to alter our religion, he would &s;erve him no longer, but withdraw from him. So early was this re&s;olution fixed in him. When he &s;aw how the King was &s;et, he could not be contented to &s;ee all ruined by him. He was al&s;o very doubtful as to the pretended birth. So he re&s;olved, when the Prince &s;hould come over, to go in to him; but to betray no po&s;t, nor do any thing more than the with drawing him&s;elf, with &s;uch Officers as he could tru&s;t with &s;uch
<PB N="766" REF="784">
a &s;ecret. He al&s;o undertook, that Prince <HI>George</HI> and the Prin|ce&s;s <HI>Anne</HI> would leave the Court, and come to the Prince, as &s;oon as was po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>With the&s;e invitations and letters the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> came over in <HI>September:</HI> And &s;oon after them came <HI>Sidney</HI> with <HI>John&s;toune.</HI> And they brought over a full &s;cheme of ad|vices, together with the heads of a declaration, all which were chiefly penned by Lord <HI>Danby.</HI> He and the Earl of <HI>Devon|&s;hire,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Lumly</HI> undertook for the North: And they all di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves into their &s;everal countries, and among their friends. The thing was in the hands of many thou&s;ands, who yet were &s;o true to one another, that none of them made any di&s;covery, no not by their ra&s;hne&s;s: Tho' they were &s;o confident, that they did not u&s;e &s;o di&s;creet a conduct as was nece&s;&s;ary. Matters went on in <HI>Holland</HI> with great &s;ecrecy till <HI>September.</HI> Then it was known, that many arms were be&s;poke. And, tho' tho&s;e were bargained for in the name of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and of &s;ome of the Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> yet there was ground enough for &s;u&s;picion. All tho&s;e that were tru&s;ted prov|ed both faithful and di&s;creet. And here an eminent difference appeared between the hearty concurrence of tho&s;e who went in|to a de&s;ign upon principles of religion and honour, and the forced compliance of mercenary Soldiers, or corrupt Mini&s;ters, which is neither cordial nor &s;ecret. <HI>France</HI> took the alarm fir&s;t, and gave it to the Court of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>D'Avaux,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador, could no more give the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Court of <HI>France</HI> gave the alarm.</NOTE> Court of <HI>France</HI> tho&s;e adverti&s;ements that he was wont to &s;end of all that pa&s;t in <HI>Holland.</HI> He had great allowances for en|tertaining agents and &s;pies every where. But <HI>Louvoy,</HI> who hated him, &s;ugge&s;ted that there was no more need of the&s;e: So they were &s;topped: And the Emba&s;&s;ador was not &s;orry, that the Court felt their error &s;o &s;en&s;ibly. The King publi&s;hed the adver|ti&s;ements he had from <HI>France</HI> a little too ra&s;hly: For all peo|ple were much animated, when they heard it from &s;uch a hand. The King &s;oon &s;aw his error: And, to correct it, he &s;aid on many occa&s;ions, that whatever the de&s;igns of the <HI>Dutch</HI> might be, he was &s;ure they were not again&s;t him. It was given out &s;ometimes, that they were again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> and then that they were again&s;t <HI>Denmark.</HI> Yet the King &s;hewed he was not with|out his fears: For he ordered fourteen more &s;hips to be put to &s;ea with many fire&s;hips. He recalled <HI>Strickland,</HI> and gave the command to the Lord <HI>Dartmouth;</HI> who was indeed one of the worthie&s;t men of his Court: He loved him, and had been long in his &s;ervice, and in his confidence: But he was much again&s;t all the conduct of his affairs: Yet he re&s;olved to &s;tick to him
<PB N="767" REF="785">
at all hazards. The &s;eamen came in &s;lowly: And a heavy back|wardne&s;s appeared in every thing.</P>
<P>A new and unlooked for accident gave the King a very &s;en|&s;ible <NOTE PLACE="marg">Recruits from <HI>Ireland</HI> refu&s;ed.</NOTE> trouble. It was re&s;olved, as was told before, to model the Army, and to begin with recruits from <HI>Ireland.</HI> Upon which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army would have become in&s;en&s;ibly an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> one. The King made the fir&s;t trial on the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI>'s Regi|ment, which being already under an illegal Colonel, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed they were ready to &s;ubmit to every thing. Five <HI>Iri&s;hmen</HI> were ordered to be put into every company of that Regiment, which then lay at <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> But <HI>Beaumont,</HI> the Lieutenant Colonel, and five of the Captains refu&s;ed to receive them. They &s;aid, they had rai&s;ed their men upon the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s inva&s;ion, by which their zeal for the King's &s;er|vice did evidently appear. If the King would order any re|cruits, they doubted not, but that they &s;hould be able to make them. But they found, it would give &s;uch an univer&s;al di&s;con|tent, if they &s;hould receive the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> among them, that it would put them out of a capacity of &s;erving the King any more. But as the order was po&s;itive, &s;o the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> was &s;ent down to &s;ee it obeyed. Upon which they de&s;ired leave to lay down their commi&s;&s;ions. The King was provoked by this to &s;uch a degree that he could not govern his pa&s;&s;ion. The Officers were put in arre&s;t, and brought before a Council of war, where they were broken with reproach, and declared incapable to &s;erve the King any more. But upon this occa&s;ion the whole Officers of the Army declared &s;o great an unwillingne&s;s to mix with tho&s;e of another Nation and Religion, that, as no more attempts were made of this kind, &s;o it was believed that this fixed the King in a point that was then under debate.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>France,</HI> when he gave the King the adverti&s;e|ments <NOTE PLACE="marg">Offers made by the <HI>French.</HI></NOTE> of the preparations in <HI>Holland,</HI> offered him &s;uch a force as he &s;hould call for. Twelve or fifteen thou&s;and were named, or as many more as he &s;hould de&s;ire. It was propo&s;ed, that they &s;hould land at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and that they &s;hould have that place to keep the communication with <HI>France</HI> open, and in their hands. All the Prie&s;ts were for this: So were mo&s;t of the Po|pi&s;h Lords. The Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI> was the only man in cre|dit that oppo&s;ed it. He &s;aid, the offer of an Army of forty thou&s;and men might be a real &s;trength: But then it would de|pend on the orders that came from <HI>France:</HI> They might per|haps ma&s;ter <HI>England:</HI> But they would become the King's ma&s;|ters at the &s;ame time: So that he mu&s;t govern under &s;uch or|ders as they &s;hould give: And thus he would quickly become only a Viceroy to the King of <HI>France:</HI> Any Army le&s;s than
<PB N="768" REF="786">
that would lo&s;e the King the affections of his people, and drive his own Army to de&s;ertion, if not to mutiny.</P>
<P>The King did not think matters were yet &s;o near a cri&s;is: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Not enter|tained at that time.</NOTE> So he did neither entertain the propo&s;ition, nor let it fall quite to the ground. There was a treaty &s;et on foot, and the King was to have an hundred merchant &s;hips ready for the tran&s;por|tation of &s;uch forces as he &s;hould de&s;ire, which it was pro|mi&s;ed &s;hould be ready when called for. It is certain, that the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador then at <HI>London,</HI> who knew the Court better than he did the Nation, did believe, that the King would have been able to have made a greater divi&s;ion of the Nation, than it proved afterwards he was able to do. He believed, it would have gone to a civil war; and that then the King would have been forced to have taken a&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>France</HI> on any terms: And &s;o he encouraged the King of <HI>France</HI> to go on with his de&s;igns that winter, and he believed he might come in good time next year to the King's a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The&s;e advices proved fatal to the King, and to <HI>Barillon</HI> him&s;elf: For, when he was &s;ent over to <HI>France,</HI> he was &s;o ill looked on, that it was believ|ed it had an ill effect on his health; for he died &s;oon after.</P>
<P><HI>Albeville</HI> came over fully per&s;uaded that the <HI>Dutch</HI> de&s;igned the expedition again&s;t <HI>England,</HI> but plaid the Mini&s;ter &s;o, that he took pains to infu&s;e into all people that they de&s;igned no &s;uch thing; which made him to be generally laughed at. He was &s;oon &s;ent back: And, in a memorial he gave into the States, he a&s;ked, what was the de&s;ign of tho&s;e great and &s;urpri&s;ing pre|parations at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on. The States, according to their &s;low forms let this lie long before them, without giving it an an|&s;wer.</P>
<P>But the Court of <HI>France</HI> made a greater &s;tep. The <HI>French</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$ the King</NOTE> Emba&s;&s;ador in a memorial told the States, that his ma&s;ter un|der&s;tood their de&s;ign was again&s;t <HI>England,</HI> and in that ca&s;e he &s;ignified to them, that there was &s;uch a &s;trait alliance between him and the King of <HI>England,</HI> that he would look on every thing done again&s;t <HI>England,</HI> as an inva&s;ion of his own Crown. This put the King and his Mini&s;ters much out of countenance: For, upon &s;ome furmi&s;es of an alliance with <HI>France,</HI> they had very po&s;itively denied there was any &s;uch thing. <HI>Albeville</HI> did con|tinue to deny it at the <HI>Hague,</HI> even after the memorial was put in. The King did likewi&s;e deny it to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador at <HI>London.</HI> And the blame of the putting it into the memori|al was ca&s;t on <HI>Shelton</HI> the King's Envoy at <HI>Paris,</HI> who was di&s;owned in it, and upon his coming over was put in the Tower for it. This was a &s;hort di&s;grace; for he was &s;oon after made Lieutenant of the Tower. His ra&s;h folly might have procur|ed
<PB N="769" REF="787">
the order from the Court of <HI>France,</HI> to own this alliance: He thought it would terrify the States: And &s;o he pre&s;&s;ed this officiou&s;ly, which they ea&s;ily granted. That related only to the owning it in &s;o publick a manner. But this did clearly prove, that &s;uch an alliance was made: Otherwi&s;e no in&s;tances, how pre&s;&s;ing &s;oever, would have prevailed with the Court of <HI>France</HI> to have owned it in &s;o &s;olemn a manner: For what Emba&s;&s;a|dors &s;ay in their ma&s;ter's name, when they are not immediate|ly di&s;owned, pa&s;&s;es for authentick. So that it was a vain cavil that &s;ome made afterwards, when they a&s;ked, how was this al|liance proved? The memorial was a full proof of it: And the &s;hew of a di&s;grace on <HI>Shelton</HI> did not at all weaken that proof.</P>
<P>But I was more confirmed of this matter by what Sir <HI>William Trumball,</HI> then the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> told me at his return to <HI>England.</HI> He was the eminente&s;t of all our Ci|vilians, and was by much the be&s;t pleader in tho&s;e Courts, and was a learned, a diligent, and a vertuous man. He was &s;ent Envoy to <HI>Paris</HI> upon the Lord <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI>'s being recalled. He was there, when the edict that repealed the edict of <HI>Nantes</HI> was pa&s;t, and &s;aw the violence of the per&s;ecution, and acted a great and worthy part in harbouring many, in covering their effects, and in conveying over their jewels and plate to <HI>England;</HI> which di&s;gu&s;ted the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and was not very acceptable to the Court of <HI>England,</HI> tho' it was not then thought fit to di&s;|own or recall him for it. He had orders to put in memorials, complaining of the inva&s;ion of the Principality of <HI>Orange;</HI> which he did in &s;o high a &s;train, that the la&s;t of them was like a de|nunciation of war. From thence he was &s;ent to <HI>Turkey.</HI> And, about this time, he was &s;urprized one morning by a vi&s;it that the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador made him, without tho&s;e ceremonies that pa&s;s between Emba&s;&s;adors. He told him, there was no cere|mony to be between them any more; for their ma&s;ters were now one. And he &s;hewed him Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Croi&s;&s;y</HI>'s letter, which was written in cypher. The decyphering he read to him, im|porting that now an alliance was concluded between the two Kings. So, this matter was as evidently proved, as a thing of &s;uch a nature could po&s;&s;ibly be.</P>
<P>The conduct of <HI>France</HI> at that time with relation to the States was <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;trange $word$ of <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> very unaccountable; and proved as favourable to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s de&s;igns, as if he had directed it. All the manufacture of <HI>Holland</HI> both linen and woolen was prohibited in <HI>France.</HI> The importation of herrings was al&s;o prohibited, except they were cured with <HI>French</HI> &s;alt. This was contrary to the treaty of commerce. The manufacture began to &s;uffer much. And
<PB N="770" REF="788">
this was &s;en&s;ible to tho&s;e who were concerned in the herring trade. So the States prohibited the importing of <HI>French</HI> wine or brandy, till the trade &s;hould be &s;et free again of both &s;ides. There was nothing that the Prince had more rea&s;on to appre|hend, than that the <HI>French</HI> &s;hould have given the States &s;ome &s;atisfaction in the point of trade, and offered &s;ome a&s;&s;urances with relation to the territory of <HI>Colen.</HI> Many of the towns of <HI>Holland</HI> might have been wrought on by &s;ome temper in the&s;e things; great bodies being ea&s;ily deceived, and not ea&s;ily drawn into wars, which interrupt that trade which they &s;ub&s;i&s;t by. But the height the Court of <HI>France</HI> was then in, made them de|&s;pi&s;e all the world. They &s;eemed rather to wi&s;h for a war, than to fear it. This di&s;po&s;ed the States to an unanimous concur|rence in the great re&s;olutions that were now agreed on, of rai|&s;ing ten thou&s;and men more, and of accepting thirteen thou|&s;and <HI>Germans,</HI> for whom the Prince had, as was formerly men|tioned, agreed with &s;ome of the Princes of the Empire. <HI>Am|&s;terdam</HI> was at fir&s;t cold in the matter: But they con&s;ented with the re&s;t. Reports were given out, that the <HI>French</HI> would &s;ettle a regulation of commerce, and that they would abandon the Cardinal, and leave the affairs of <HI>Colen</HI> to be &s;ettled by the laws of the Empire. Expedients were al&s;o &s;poke of for accom|modating the matter, by Prince <HI>Clement</HI>'s being admitted Co|adjutor, and by his having &s;ome of the &s;trong places put in his hands. This was only given out to amu&s;e.</P>
<P>But while the&s;e things were di&s;cour&s;ed of at the <HI>Hague,</HI> the <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Manife&s;to of war a|gain&s;t the Empire</NOTE> world was &s;urpri&s;ed with a Manife&s;to &s;et out, in the King of <HI>France</HI>'s name, again&s;t the Emperor. In it, the Emperor's ill de&s;igns again&s;t <HI>France</HI> were &s;et forth. It al&s;o complained of the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI>'s inju&s;tice to the Duche&s;s of <HI>Orleans,</HI> in not giv|ing her the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion that fell to her by her brother's death, which con&s;i&s;ted in &s;ome lands, cannon, furniture, and other move|able goods. It al&s;o charged him with the di&s;turbances in <HI>Colen,</HI> he having intended fir&s;t to gain that to one of his own &s;ons, and then engaging the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Prince into it; who&s;e elder brother having no children, he hoped, by bringing him into an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State, to make the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Bavaria</HI> fall into his own family. It charged the Emperor likewi&s;e with a de&s;ign to force the Electors to choo&s;e his &s;on King of the <HI>Ro|mans;</HI> and that the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> was pre&s;&s;ing him to make peace with the <HI>Turks,</HI> in order to the turning his arms again&s;t <HI>France.</HI> By their means a great alliance was projected among many Prote&s;tant Princes to di&s;turb Cardinal <HI>Fur&s;temberg</HI> in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Colen,</HI> to which he was po&s;tulated by the majority of the Chapter. And this might turn to the prejudice of the
<PB N="771" REF="789">
Catholick Religion in that territory. Upon all the&s;e con&s;idera|tions, the King of <HI>France,</HI> &s;eeing that his enemies could not enter into <HI>France</HI> by any other way but by that of <HI>Philipsburg,</HI> re&s;olved to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of it, and then to demoli&s;h it. He re&s;olved al&s;o to take <HI>Kai&s;ar&s;lauter</HI> from the <HI>Palatine,</HI> and to keep it, till the Duche&s;s of <HI>Orleans</HI> had ju&s;tice done her in her pre|ten&s;ions. And he al&s;o re&s;olved to &s;upport the Cardinal in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Colen.</HI> But, to balance this, he offered to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> that Prince <HI>Clement</HI> &s;hould be cho&s;en Coadjutor. He offered al&s;o to ra&s;e <HI>Fribourg,</HI> and to re&s;tore <HI>Kai&s;ar&s;lauter,</HI> as &s;oon as the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> &s;hould pay the Duche&s;s of <HI>Orleans</HI> the ju&s;t value of her preten&s;ions. He demanded, that the truce between him and the Empire &s;hould be turned into a peace. He propo&s;ed, that the King of <HI>England</HI> and the Republick of <HI>Venice</HI> &s;hould be the mediators of this peace. And he concluded all, declaring that he would not bind him&s;elf to &s;tand to the con|ditions now offered by him, unle&s;s they were accepted of before <HI>January.</HI></P>
<P>I have given a full ab&s;tract of this Manife&s;to: For upon it did <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections made upon it.</NOTE> the great war begin, which la&s;ted till the peace of <HI>Ryswick.</HI> And, upon the grounds laid down in this Manife&s;to, it will evi|dently appear, whether the war was a ju&s;t one, or not. This declaration was much cen&s;ured, both for the matter and for the &s;tile. It had not the air of greatne&s;s, which became crowned heads. The Duche&s;s of <HI>Orleans</HI>'s preten&s;ions to old furniture, was a &s;trange ri&s;e to a war; e&s;pecially when it was not alledged, that the&s;e had been demanded in the forms of law, and that ju&s;tice had been denied, which was a cour&s;e nece&s;&s;arily to be ob&s;erved in things of that nature. The judging of the &s;ecret intenti|ons of the Elector <HI>Palatine</HI> with relation to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bava|ria</HI> was ab&s;urd. And the complaints of de&s;igns to bring the Emperor to a peace with the <HI>Turks,</HI> that &s;o he might make war on <HI>France,</HI> and of the Emperor's de&s;ign to force an election of a King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> was the entring into the &s;ecrets of tho&s;e thoughts, which were only known to God. Such conjectures, &s;o remote and uncertain, and that could not be proved, were a &s;trange ground of war. If this was once admitted, all trea|ties of peace were vain things, and were no more to be reckon|ed or relied on. The rea&s;on given of the intention to take <HI>Philipsbourg,</HI> becau&s;e it was the propere&s;t place by which <HI>France</HI> could be invaded, was a throwing off all regards to the common decencies ob&s;erved by Princes. All fortified places on frontiers are intended both for re&s;i&s;tance and for magazines, and are of both &s;ides conveniencies for entring into the neighbour|ing territory, as there is occa&s;ion for it. So here was a pre|tence
<PB N="772" REF="790">
&s;et up, of beginning a war, that puts an end to all the &s;ecurities of peace.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Colen</HI> was judged by the Pope, according to the laws of the Empire: And his &s;entence was final: Nor could the po&s;tulation of the majority of the Chapter be valid, unle&s;s two thirds joined in it. The Cardinal was commended in the Manife&s;to, for his care in pre&s;erving the peace of <HI>Europe.</HI> This was ridiculous to all, who knew that he had been for many years the great incendiary, who had betrayed the Empire, chief|ly in the year 1672. The charge that the Emperor's agent had laid on him before the Chapter was al&s;o complained of, as an infraction of the Amne&s;ty &s;tipulated by the peace of <HI>Nimeguen.</HI> He was not indeed to be called to an account, in order to be puni&s;hed for any thing done before that peace. But that did not bind up the Emperor from endeavouring to exclude him from &s;o great a dignity, which was like to prove fatal to the Empire. The&s;e were &s;ome of the cen&s;ures that pa&s;t on this Manife&s;to; which was indeed looked on, by all who had con|&s;idered the rights of peace and the laws of war, as one of the mo&s;t avowed and &s;olemn declarations, that ever was made, of the perfidiou&s;ne&s;s of that Court. And it was thought to be &s;ome degrees beyond that in the year 1672, in which that King's glory was pretended as the chief motive of that war. For, in that, particulars were not reckoned up: So it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, he had met with affronts, which he did not think con&s;i&s;tent with his greatne&s;s to be mentioned. But here all that could be thought on, even the hangings of <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> were enumerated: And all together amounted to this, that the King of <HI>France</HI> thought him&s;elf tied by no peace; but that, when he &s;u&s;pected his neigh|bours were intending to make war upon him, he might upon &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion begin a war on his part.</P>
<P>This Manife&s;to again&s;t the Emperor was followed by another <NOTE PLACE="marg">Another a|$span$ the Pope</NOTE> again&s;t the Pope, writ in the form of a letter to Cardinal <HI>D'E&s;trees,</HI> to be given by him to the Pope. In it, he reckoned all the par|tiality that the Pope had &s;hewed during his whole Pontificate, both again&s;t <HI>France</HI> and in favour of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> He mentioned the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Regale; his refu&s;ing the Bulls to the Bi&s;hops nominated by him; the di&s;pute about the fran|chi&s;es, of which his Emba&s;&s;adors had been long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; the denying audience, not only to his Emba&s;&s;ador, but to a Gentleman whom he had &s;ent to <HI>Rome</HI> without a character, and with a letter writ in his own hand: In conclu&s;ion, he com|plained of the Pope's breaking the Canons of the Church, in granting Bulls in favour of Prince <HI>Clement,</HI> and in denying ju&s;tice to Cardinal <HI>Pin&s;temberg:</HI> For all the&s;e rea&s;ons the King was re|&s;olved
<PB N="773" REF="791">
to &s;eparate the character of the Mo&s;t Holy Father from that of a temporal Prince: And therefore he intended to &s;eize on <HI>Avignon,</HI> as likewi&s;e on <HI>Ca&s;tro,</HI> untill the Pope &s;hould &s;atisfy the preten&s;ions of the Duke of <HI>Parma.</HI> He complained of the Pope's not concurring with him in the concerns of the Church, for the extirpation of here&s;y: In which the Pope's behaviour gave great &s;candal both to the old Catholicks, and to the new con|verts. It al&s;o gave the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> the boldne&s;s to go and invade the King of <HI>England,</HI> under the pretence of &s;upporting the Prote&s;tant religion, but indeed to de&s;troy the Catholick religion, and to overturn the Government: Upon which his emi&s;|&s;aries and the writers in <HI>Holland</HI> gave out, that the birth of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> was an impo&s;ture.</P>
<P>This was the fir&s;t publick mention that was made of the im|po&s;ture <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cen&s;ures that pa&s;t $$|on it</NOTE> of that birth: For the author of a book writ to that purpo&s;e was puni&s;hed for it in <HI>Holland.</HI> It was &s;trange to &s;ee the di&s;putes about the Franchi&s;es made a pretence for a war: For certainly all &s;overeign Princes can make &s;uch regulations as they think fit in tho&s;e matters. If they cut Emba&s;&s;adors &s;hort in any privilege, their Emba&s;&s;adors are to expect the &s;ame treat|ment from other Princes: And as long as the &s;acredne&s;s of an Emba&s;&s;ador's per&s;on, and of his family, was &s;till pre&s;erved, which was all that was a part of the law of Nations, Princes may certainly limit the extent of their other privileges, and may refu&s;e any Emba&s;&s;adors, who will not &s;ubmit to their regulati|on. The number of an Emba&s;&s;ador's retinue is not a thing that can be well defined: But if an Emba&s;&s;ador comes with an army about him, in&s;tead of a retinue, he may be denied admittance. And if he forces it, as <HI>Lavardin</HI> had done, it was certainly an act of ho&s;tility: And, in&s;tead of having a right to the character of an Emba&s;&s;ador, he might well be con&s;idered and treated as an enemy.</P>
<P>The Pope had ob&s;erved the Canons in rejecting Cardinal <HI>Fur&s;temburg</HI>'s defective po&s;tulation. And, whatever might be brought from ancient Canons, the practice of that Church for many ages allowed of the di&s;pen&s;ations that the Pope granted to Prince <HI>Clement.</HI> It was looked on by all people, as a &s;trange rever&s;e of things, to &s;ee the King of <HI>France,</HI> after all his cru|elty to the Prote&s;tants, now go to make war on the Pope; and on the other hand to &s;ee the whole Prote&s;tant body concurring to &s;upport the authority of the Pope's Bulls in the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Colon;</HI> and to defend the two Hou&s;es of <HI>Ari&s;tria</HI> and <HI>B$span$,</HI> by whom they were laid &s;o low but three&s;core years before $span$ The <HI>French,</HI> by the war that they had now begun, had &s;en$ their troops towards <HI>Germany</HI> and the upper <HI>Rhin$;</HI> and &s;o had

rendred their &s;ending an Army over to <HI>England</HI> impracticable: Nor could they &s;end &s;uch a force into the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Colen,</HI> as could any ways alarm the States. So that the inva&s;ion of <HI>Ger|many</HI> made the de&s;igns that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was engaged in both practicable and &s;afe.</P>
<P>Mar&s;hal <HI>Schomberg</HI> came at this time into the country of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar&s;hal <HI>Schomberg</HI> &s;ent to <HI>Cleve.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Cleve.</HI> He was a <HI>German</HI> by birth: So when the per&s;ecution was begun in <HI>France,</HI> he de&s;ired leave to return into his own Country. That was denied him. All the favour he could obtain, was leave to go to <HI>Portugal.</HI> And &s;o cruel is the &s;pirit of Popery, that, though he had pre&s;erved that Kingdom from falling under the yoke of <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> yet now that he came thither for refuge, the Inqui&s;ition repre&s;ented that matter of giving harbour to a heretick &s;o odiou&s;ly to the King, that he was forced to &s;end him away. He came from thence, fir&s;t to <HI>England:</HI> And then he pa&s;&s;ed thro' <HI>Holland,</HI> where he entred into a particular confidence with the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI> And being invited by the old Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> he went to <HI>Berlin:</HI> Where he was made Governor of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and &s;et at the head of all the Elector's armies. The &s;on treated him now with the &s;ame regard that the father had for him: And &s;ent him to <HI>Cleve,</HI> to command the troops that were &s;ent from the Empire to the defence of <HI>Colen.</HI> The Cardinal offered a neutrality to the Town of <HI>Colen.</HI> But they choo&s;e rather to accept a garri|&s;on that <HI>Schomberg</HI> &s;ent them: By which not only that Town was &s;ecured, but a &s;top was put to any progre&s;s the <HI>French</HI> could make, till they could get that great Town into their hands. By the&s;e means the States were &s;afe on all hands for this winter: And this gave the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> great quiet in pro&s;ecuting his de&s;igns upon <HI>England.</HI> He had often &s;aid, that he would never give occa&s;ion to any of his enemies to &s;ay, that he had carried away the be&s;t force of the States, and had left them expo&s;ed to any impre&s;&s;ions that might be made on them in his ab&s;ence. He had now rea&s;on to conclude, that he had no other ri&s;k to run in his intended expedition, but that of the &s;eas and the weather. The &s;eas were then very boi&s;terous: And the &s;ea|&s;on of the year was &s;o far &s;pent, that he &s;aw he was to have a campaign in winter. But all other things were now well &s;ecured by this unexpected conduct of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>There was a fleet now &s;et to &s;ea of about fifty &s;ail. Mo&s;t of them were third or fourth rates, commanded by <HI>Dutch</HI> Offi|cers. <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> But <HI>Herbert,</HI> as repre&s;enting the Prince's per&s;on, was to command in chief, as Lieutenant General Admiral. This was not very ea&s;y to the States, nor indeed to the Prince him&s;elf; who thought it an ab&s;urd thing to &s;et a &s;tranger at the head of their
<PB N="775" REF="793">
fleet. Nothing le&s;s would content <HI>Herbert.</HI> And it was &s;aid, that nothing would probably make the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fleet come over, and join with the Prince, &s;o much as the &s;eeing one that had lately commanded them at the head of the <HI>Dutch</HI> fleet. There was a tran&s;port fleet hired for carrying over the Army. And this grew to be about five hundred ve&s;&s;els: For, tho' the hor&s;e and dragoons in pay were not four thou&s;and, yet the hor&s;es for officers and voluntiers, and for artillery and baggage, were above &s;even thou&s;and. There were arms provided for twenty thou&s;and more. And, as things were thus made ready,</P>
<P>The declaration that the Prince was to publi&s;h came to be <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s declaration.</NOTE> con&s;idered. A great many draughts were &s;ent from <HI>England</HI> by different hands. All the&s;e were put in the Pen&s;ioner <HI>Fagel</HI>'s hands, who upon that made a long and heavy draught, found|ed on the grounds of the civil law, and of the law of Nati|ons. That was brought to me to be put in <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> I &s;aw he was fond of his own draught: And the Prince left that matter wholly to him: Yet I got it to be much &s;hortned, tho' it was &s;till too long. It &s;et forth at fir&s;t a long recital of all the vio|lations of the laws of <HI>England,</HI> both with relation to religion, to the civil government, and to the admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, which have been all opened in the &s;eries of the hi&s;tory. It &s;et forth next all remedies that had been tried in a gentler way; all which had been ineffectual. Petitioning by the greate&s;t per&s;ons, and in the private&s;t manner, was made a crime. Endeavours were u&s;ed to pack a Parliament, and to pre-ingage both the votes of the electors, and the votes of &s;uch as upon the election &s;hould be returned to &s;it in Parliament. The writs were to be addre&s;&s;ed to unlawful officers, who were di&s;abled by law to execute them: So that no legal Parliament could now be brought together. In conclu&s;ion, the rea&s;ons of &s;u&s;pecting the Queen's pretend|ed delivery were &s;et forth in general terms. Upon the&s;e grounds the Prince, &s;eeing how little hope was left of &s;ucceeding in any other method, and being &s;en&s;ible of the ruin both of the Prote&s;tant religion, and of the con&s;titution of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ire|land,</HI> that was imminent, and being earne&s;tly invited by men of all ranks, and in particular by many of the Peers, both Spi|ritual and Temporal, he re&s;olved, according to the obligation he lay under, both on the Prince&s;s's account, and on his own, to go over into <HI>England,</HI> and to &s;ee for proper and effectual remedies for redre&s;&s;ing &s;uch growing evils in a Parliament that &s;hould be lawfully cho&s;en, and &s;hould &s;it in full freedom, ac|cording to the ancient cu&s;tom and con&s;titution of <HI>England,</HI> with which he would concur in all things that might tend to the peace and happine&s;s of the Nation. And he promi&s;ed in par|ticular,
<PB N="776" REF="794">
that he would pre&s;erve the Church and the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, and that he would endeavour to unite all &s;uch as di|vided from the Church to it by the be&s;t means that could be thought on, and that he would &s;uffer &s;uch as would live peace|ably to enjoy all due freedom in their con&s;ciences, and that he would refer the enquiry into the Queen's delivery to a Parlia|ment, and acquie&s;ce in its deci&s;ion. This the Prince &s;igned and &s;ealed on the tenth of <HI>October.</HI> With this the Prince ordered letters to be writ in his name, inviting both the &s;oldiers, &s;ea|men, and others to come and join with him, in order to the &s;ecuring their religion, laws, and liberties. Another &s;hort paper was drawn by me concerning the mea&s;ures of obedience, ju&s;ti|fying the de&s;ign, and an&s;wering the objections that might be made to it. Of all the&s;e many thou&s;and copies were printed, to be di&s;per&s;ed at our landing.</P>
<P>The Prince de&s;ired me to go along with him as his Chap|lain, <NOTE PLACE="marg">I was de&s;ir|ed to go with the Prince.</NOTE> to which I very readily agreed: For, being fully &s;atisfied in my con&s;cience that the undertaking was lawful and ju&s;t, and having had a con&s;iderable hand in advi&s;ing the whole progre&s;s of it, I thought it would have been an unbecoming fear in me to have taken care of my own per&s;on, when the Prince was venturing his, and the whole was now to be put to hazard. It is true, I being a <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> man by birth, had rea&s;on to expect, that, if I had fallen into the enemies hands, I &s;hould have been &s;ent to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and put to the torture there. And, having this in pro&s;pect, I took care to know no particulars of any one of tho&s;e who corre&s;ponded with the Prince. So that knowing nothing again&s;t any, even torture it &s;elf could not have drawn from me that by which any per&s;on could be hurt. There was another declaration prepared for <HI>Scotland.</HI> But I had no other &s;hare in that, but that I corrected it in &s;everal places, chiefly in that which related to the Church: For the <HI>Scots</HI> at the <HI>Hague,</HI> who were all Pre&s;byterians, had drawn it &s;o, that, by many pa&s;&s;ages in it, the Prince by an implication declared in favour of Pre&s;|bytery. He did not &s;ee what the con&s;equences of tho&s;e were, till I explained them. So he ordered them to be altered. And by the declaration that matter was &s;till entire.</P>
<P>As <HI>Sidney</HI> brought over letters from the per&s;ons formerly <NOTE PLACE="marg">Advices from <HI>Eng|land.</HI></NOTE> mentioned, both inviting the Prince to come over to &s;ave and re&s;cue Nation from ruin, and a&s;&s;uring him that they wrote that which was the univer&s;al &s;en&s;e of all the wi&s;e and good men in the Nation: So they al&s;o &s;ent over with him a &s;cheme of ad|vices. They advi&s;ed his having a great Fleet, but a &s;mall Army: They thought, it &s;hould not exceed &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and men. They apprehended, that an ill u&s;e might be made of it, if he
<PB N="777" REF="795">
brought over too great an Army of foreigners, to infu&s;e in people a jealou&s;y that he de&s;igned a conque&s;t: They advi&s;ed his landing in the North, either in <HI>Burlington</HI> bay, or a little below <HI>Hull: York&s;hire</HI> abounded in hor&s;e: And the Gentry were generally well affected, even to zeal, for the de&s;ign: The coun|try was plentiful, and the roads were good till within fifty miles of <HI>London.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> was earne&s;t for this, hoping to have had a &s;hare in the whole management by the intere&s;t he believed he had in that country. It was confe&s;&s;ed, that the we&s;tern counties were well affected: But it was &s;aid, that the mi&s;carriage of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s inva&s;ion, and the executions which followed it, had &s;o di&s;pirited them, that it could not be ex|pected they would be forward to join the Prince: Above all things they pre&s;&s;ed di&s;patch, and all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te: The King had then but eighteen &s;hips riding in the <HI>Downs:</HI> But a much greater Fleet was almo&s;t ready to come out: They only wanted &s;eamen, who came in very &s;lowly.</P>
<P>When the&s;e things were laid before the Prince, he &s;aid, he could by no means re&s;olve to come over with &s;o &s;mall a force: He could not believe what they &s;ugge&s;ted, concerning the King's Army's being di&s;po&s;ed to come over to him: Nor did he reckon, &s;o much as they did, on the people of the coun|try's coming in to him: He &s;aid, he could tru&s;t to neither of the&s;e: He could not undertake &s;o great a de&s;ign, the mi&s;car|riage of which would be the ruin both of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> without &s;uch a force, as he had rea&s;on to believe would be &s;u|perior to the King's own, tho' his whole Army &s;hould &s;tick to him. Some propo&s;ed, that the Prince would divide his force, and land him&s;elf with the greate&s;t part in the North, and &s;end a detachment to the We&s;t under Mar&s;hal <HI>Scho$span$berg.</HI> They pre&s;&s;ed the Prince very earne&s;tly to bring him over with him, both becau&s;e of the great reputation he was in, and becau&s;e they thought it was a &s;ecurity to the Prince's per&s;on, and to the whole de&s;ign, to have another General with him, to whom all would &s;ubmit in ca&s;e of any di&s;mal accident: For it &s;eemed too much to have all depend on a &s;ingle life: And they thought that would be the &s;afer, if their enemies &s;aw another per&s;on capable of the command, in ca&s;e they &s;hould have a de&s;ign up|on the Prince's per&s;on. With this the Prince complied ea&s;ily, and obtained the Elector's con&s;ent to carry him over with him. But he rejected the motion of dividing his Fleet and Army. He &s;aid, &s;uch a divided force might be fatal: For if the King &s;hould &s;end his chief &s;trength again&s;t the detachment, and have the advantage, it might lo&s;e the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ince a mi&s;|fortune in any one part might be the ruin of the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="778" REF="796">
When the&s;e advices were propo&s;ed to <HI>Herbert,</HI> and the other &s;eamen, they oppo&s;ed the landing in the North vehemently. They &s;aid, no &s;eamen had been con&s;ulted in that: The North coa&s;t was not fit for a Fleet to ride in in an Ea&s;t wind, which it was to be expected in winter might blow &s;o fre&s;h that it would not be po&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve the Fleet: And if the Fleet was left there, the Channel was open for &s;uch forces as might be &s;ent from <HI>France:</HI> The Channel was the &s;afer &s;ea for the Fleet to ride in, as well as to cut off the a&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>France.</HI> Yet the advices for this were &s;o po&s;itive, and &s;o often repeated from <HI>England,</HI> that the Prince was re&s;olved to have &s;plit the matter, and to have landed in the North, and then to have &s;ent the Fleet to lie in the Channel.</P>
<P>The Prince continued &s;till to cover his de&s;ign, and to look towards <HI>Colen.</HI> He ordered a review of his Army, and an en|campment <NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ to $word$ the de|$word$</NOTE> for two months at <HI>Nimeguen.</HI> A train of artillery was al&s;o ordered. By the&s;e orders the Officers &s;aw a nece&s;&s;ity of furni&s;hing them&s;elves for &s;o long a time. The main point remained, how money &s;hould be found for &s;o chargeable an ex|pedition. The <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador had his eye upon this; and reckoned that, when&s;oever any thing relating to it &s;hould be moved, it would be then ea&s;y to rai&s;e an oppo&s;ition, or at lea&s;t to create a delay. But <HI>Fagel</HI>'s great fore&s;ight did prevent this. In the <HI>July</HI> before, it was repre&s;ented to the States, that now by rea&s;on of the neighbourhood of <HI>Colen,</HI> and the war that was like to ri&s;e there, it was nece&s;&s;ary to repair their places, both on the <HI>R$span$e</HI> and the <HI>I&s;&s;el,</HI> which were in a very bad conditi|on. This was agreed to: And the charge was e&s;timated at four millions of Guilders. So the States created a fund for the in|tere&s;t of that money, and ordered it to be taken up by a loan. It was all brought in in four days. About the end of <HI>Septem|ber</HI> a me&s;&s;age was delivered to the States from the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> by which he undertook to &s;end an Army into his country of <HI>Cleve,</HI> and to &s;ecure the States from all danger on that &s;ide for this winter.</P>
<P>Upon this, it was propo&s;ed, to lend the Prince the four millions. And this pa&s;&s;ed ea&s;ily in the States, without any oppo|$span$, to the amazement of all that &s;aw it: For it had never $word$ known, that &s;o great and &s;o dangerous an expedition in &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on had been &s;o ea&s;ily agreed to, without &s;o much as $word$ $word$ vote, either at the <HI>Hague,</HI> or in any of the Towns of <HI>Holland.</HI> All people went &s;o cordially into it, that it was not nece&s;&s;ary to employ much time in &s;atisfying them, both of the lawfulne&s;&s; and of the nece&s;&s;ity of the undertaking&punc; <HI>$word$</HI> had &s;ent for all the e$span$nt Mini&s;ters of the chief Towns of
<PB N="779" REF="797">
<HI>Holland:</HI> And, as he had a vehemence as well as a tenderne&s;s in &s;peaking, he convinced them evidently, that both their religi|on and their country were in &s;uch imminent danger, that no|thing but this expedition could &s;ave them: They &s;aw the per|&s;ecution in <HI>France:</HI> And in that they might &s;ee what was to be expected from that religion: They &s;aw the violence with which the King of <HI>England</HI> was driving matters in his country, which if not &s;topped would &s;oon prevail. He &s;ent them thus full of zeal, to di&s;po&s;e the people to a hearty approbation and con|currence in this de&s;ign. The Mini&s;ters in <HI>Holland</HI> are &s;o watch|ed over by the States, that they have no more authority when they meet in a body, in a Synod or in a Cla&s;&s;is, than the States think fit to allow them. But I was never in any place, where I thought the Clergy had generally &s;o much credit with the people, as they have there: And they employed it all up|on this occa&s;ion very diligently, and to good purpo&s;e. Tho&s;e who had no regard to religion, yet &s;aw a war began in the Empire by the <HI>French.</HI> And the publication of the alliance be|tween <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI> by the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador, made them conclude that <HI>England</HI> would join with <HI>France.</HI> They reckon|ed, they could not &s;tand before &s;uch an united force, and that therefore it was nece&s;&s;ary to take <HI>England</HI> out of the hands of a Prince, who was &s;uch a firm ally to <HI>France.</HI> All the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that lived in <HI>Holland,</HI> e&s;pecially the merchants that were &s;et|tled in <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> where the oppo&s;ition was like to be &s;trong|e&s;t, had &s;uch po&s;itive advices of the di&s;po&s;ition that the Nation, and even the Army were in; that, as this undertaking was con|&s;idered as the only probable means of their pre&s;ervation, it &s;eem|ed &s;o well concerted, that little doubt was made of &s;ucce&s;s, ex|cept what aro&s;e from the &s;ea&s;on; which was not only far &s;pent, but the winds were both &s;o contrary and &s;o &s;tormy for many weeks, that a forcible &s;top &s;eemed put to it by the hand of heaven.</P>
<P><HI>Herbert</HI> went to &s;ea with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet: And was ordered <NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>$word$</HI> put to $word$.</NOTE> to &s;tand over to the <HI>Downs,</HI> and to look on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, to try if any would come over, of which &s;ome hopes were given; or to engage them, while they were then not above eigh|teen or twenty &s;hips &s;trong. But the contrary winds made this not only impracticable, but gave great rea&s;on to fear that a great part of the Fleet would be either lo&s;t or di&s;abled. The&s;e continued for above a fortnight, and gave us at the <HI>Hague</HI> a melancholy pro&s;pect. <HI>Herbert</HI> al&s;o found, that the Fleet was neither &s;o &s;trong, nor &s;o well manned, as he had ex|pected.</P>

All the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that were &s;cattered about the Provinces, or in <HI>Germany,</HI> came to the <HI>Hague.</HI> Among the&s;e there was one <HI>Wildman,</HI> who, from being an agitator in <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Army, had <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some facti|ous motions at the <HI>Hague.</HI></NOTE> been a con&s;tant meddler on all occa&s;ions in every thing that looked like &s;edition, and &s;eemed inclined to oppo&s;e every thing that was uppermo&s;t. He brought his u&s;ual ill humour along with him, having a peculiar talent in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing others by a &s;ort of contagion with jealou&s;y and di&s;content. To the&s;e the Prince ordered his declaration to be &s;hewed. <HI>Wildman</HI> took great exceptions to it, with which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many to &s;uch a degree, that they began to &s;ay, they would not engage upon tho&s;e grounds. <HI>Wildman</HI> had drawn one, in which he had laid down a &s;cheme of the government of <HI>England,</HI> and then had &s;et forth many particulars in which it had been violated, carrying the&s;e a great way into King <HI>Charles</HI>'s reign; all which he &s;upported by many authorities from law books. He object|ed to the Prince's in&s;i&s;ting &s;o much on the Di&s;pen&s;ing Power, and on what had been done to the Bi&s;hops. He &s;aid, there was certainly a Di&s;pen&s;ing Power in the Crown, practi&s;ed for &s;ome ages: Very few Patents pa&s;&s;ed in which there was not a <HI>non ob&s;tante</HI> to one or more acts of Parliament: This power had been too far &s;tretched of late: But the &s;tretching of a power that was in the Crown, could not be a ju&s;t ground of war: The King had a right to bring any man to a trial: The Bi&s;hops had a fair trial, and were acquitted, and di&s;charged upon it: In all which there was nothing done contrary to law. All this &s;eem|ed my&s;terious, when a known Republican was become an ad|vocate for Prerogative. His de&s;ign in this was deep and &s;piteful. He &s;aw that, as the declaration was drawn, the Church party would come in, and be well received by the Prince: So he, who de&s;igned to &s;eparate the Prince and them at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from one another, &s;tudied to make the Prince declare again&s;t tho&s;e grievances, in which many of them were con|cerned, and which &s;ome among them had promoted. The Earl of <HI>Macclesfield,</HI> with the Lord <HI>Mordaunt,</HI> and many others, joined with him in this. But the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> toge|ther with <HI>Sidney, Ru&s;&s;el,</HI> and &s;ome others, were as po&s;itive in their opinion, that the Prince ought not to look &s;o far back as into King <HI>Charles</HI>'s reign: This would di&s;gu&s;t many of the Nobility and Gentry, and almo&s;t all the Clergy: So they thought the declaration was to be &s;o conceived, as to draw in the body of the whole Nation. They were all alarmed with the Di&s;pen|&s;ing Power: And it would &s;eem very &s;trange to &s;ee an inva&s;i|on, in which this was not &s;et out as the main ground of it: Every man could di&s;tingui&s;h between the di&s;pen&s;ing with a &s;pe|cial
<PB N="781" REF="801">
act in a particular ca&s;e, and a total di&s;pen&s;ing with laws to &s;ecure the Nation and the Religion: The ill de&s;igns of the Court, as well as the affections of the Nation, had appeared &s;o evident|ly in the Bi&s;hops trial, that if no notice was taken of it, it would be made u&s;e of to po&s;&s;e&s;s all people with an opinion of the Prince's ill will to them. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> &s;aid, that any reflections made on King <HI>Charles</HI>'s reign would not only carry over all the high Church party, but all the Army, entirely to the King. <HI>Wild|man</HI>'s declaration was much objected to. The Prince could not enter into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the law and government of <HI>England:</HI> That was to be left to the Parliament: The Prince could only &s;et forth the pre&s;ent and publick grievances, as they were tran&s;mitted to him by tho&s;e upon who&s;e invitation he was go|ing over. This was not without &s;ome difficulty overcome, by altering &s;ome few expre&s;&s;ions in the fir&s;t draught, and leaving out &s;ome circum&s;tances. So the declaration was printed over again, with &s;ome amendments.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>October</HI> the troops marched from <HI>Nime|guen</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Army was &s;hipped.</NOTE> were put on board in the <HI>Zuyder</HI> &s;ea, where they lay above ten days before they could get out of the <HI>Texel.</HI> Never was &s;o great a de&s;ign executed in &s;o &s;hort a time. A tran&s;port fleet of five hundred ve&s;&s;els was hired in three days time. All things, as &s;oon as they were ordered, were got to be &s;o quickly ready, that we were amazed at the di&s;patch. It is true, &s;ome things were wanting, and &s;ome things had been forgot. But when the greatne&s;s of the equipage was con&s;idered, together with the &s;e|crecy with which it was to be conducted till the whole de&s;ign was to be avowed, it &s;eemed much more &s;trange that &s;o little was wanting, or that &s;o few things had been forgot. <HI>Benthink, Dykvelt, Herbert,</HI> and <HI>Van Hul&s;t,</HI> were for two months con|&s;tantly at the <HI>Hague,</HI> giving all nece&s;&s;ary orders, with &s;o little noi&s;e that nothing broke out all that while. Even in le&s;&s;er mat|ters favourable circum&s;tances concurred to cover the de&s;ign. <HI>Benthink</HI> u&s;ed to be con&s;tantly with the Prince, being the per|&s;on that was mo&s;t entirely tru&s;ted and con&s;tantly employed by him: So that his ab&s;ence from him, being &s;o extraordinary a thing, might have given &s;ome umbrage. But all the &s;ummer his Lady was &s;o very ill, that &s;he was looked on every day as one that could not live three days to an end: So that this was a very ju&s;t excu&s;e for his attendance at the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P>I waited on the Prince&s;s a few days before we left the <HI>Hague.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The $span$</NOTE> She &s;eemed to have a great load on her &s;pirits, but to have no &s;cruple as to the lawfulne&s;s of the de&s;ign. After much other di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;aid, that if we got &s;afe to <HI>England,</HI> I made no great doubt of our &s;ucce&s;s in all other things. I only begged her
<PB N="782" REF="802">
pardon to tell her, that if there &s;hould happen to be at any time any disjointing between the Prince and her, that would ruin all. She an&s;wered me, that I needed fear no &s;uch thing: If any per&s;on &s;hould attempt that, &s;he would treat them &s;o, as to di&s;courage all others from venturing on it for the future. She was very &s;olemn and &s;erious, and prayed God earne&s;tly to ble&s;s and direct us.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixteenth of <HI>October O. S.</HI> the wind that had &s;tood <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince took leave of the States.</NOTE> &s;o long in the We&s;t, came into the Ea&s;t. So orders were &s;ent to all to ha&s;te to <HI>Helvoet-Sluys.</HI> That morning the Prince went into the a&s;&s;embly of the States General, to take leave of them. He &s;aid to them, he was extream &s;en&s;ible of the kindne&s;s they had all &s;hewed him upon many occa&s;ions: He took God to wit|ne&s;s, he had &s;erved them faithfully, ever &s;ince they had tru&s;ted him with the government, and that he had never any end before his eyes but the good of the country: He had pur&s;ued it al|ways: And if at any time he erred in his judgment, yet his heart was ever &s;et on procuring their &s;afety and pro&s;perity. He took God to witne&s;s, he went to <HI>England</HI> with no other in|tentions, but tho&s;e he had &s;et out in his declaration: He did not know how God might di&s;po&s;e of him: To his providence he committed him&s;elf: What&s;oever might become of him, he committed to them the care of their country, and recommend|ed the Prince&s;s to them in a mo&s;t particular manner: He a&s;|&s;ured them, &s;he loved their country perfectly, and equally with her own: He hoped, that whatever might happen to him, they would &s;till protect her, and u&s;e her as &s;he well de&s;erved: And &s;o he took leave. It was a &s;ad, but a kind parting. Some of every Province offered at an an&s;wer to what the Prince had &s;aid: But they all melted into tears and pa&s;&s;ion: So that their &s;peeches were much broken, very &s;hort, and extream tender. Only the Prince him&s;elf continued firm in his u&s;ual gravity and phlegm. When he came to <HI>Helvoet-Sluys,</HI> the tran&s;port fleet had con&s;umed &s;o much of their provi&s;ions, that three days of the good wind were lo&s;t, before all were &s;upplied anew.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, on the nineteenth of <HI>October,</HI> the Prince went aboard, <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$.</NOTE> and the whole Fleet &s;ailed out that night. But the next day the wind turned into the North, and &s;ettled in the North-We&s;t. At night a great &s;torm ro&s;e. We wrought again&s;t it all that night, and the next day. But it was in vain to &s;truggle any longer. And &s;o va&s;t a Fleet run no &s;mall hazard, being obliged to keep together, and yet not to come too near one another. On the twenty fir&s;t in the afternoon the &s;ignal was given to go in again: And on the twenty &s;econd the far greater part got &s;afe into port. Many &s;hips were at fir&s;t wanting, and were believ|ed
<PB N="783" REF="803">
to be lo&s;t. But after a few days all came in. There was not one &s;hip lo&s;t; nor &s;o much as any one man, except one that was blown from the &s;hrouds into the &s;ea. Some &s;hips were &s;o <NOTE PLACE="marg">But were forced back.</NOTE> &s;hattered, that as &s;oon as they came in, and all was taken out of them, they immediately &s;unk down. Only five hundred hor&s;es died for want of air. Men are upon &s;uch occa&s;ions apt to flat|ter them&s;elves upon the points of providence. In <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> as it was believed that our lo&s;s was much greater than it proved to be, &s;o they triumphed not a little, as if God had fought again&s;t us, and defeated the whole de&s;ign. We on our part, who found our &s;elves delivered out of &s;o great a &s;torm and &s;o va&s;t a danger, looked on it as a mark of God's great care of us, who, tho' he had not changed the cour&s;e of the winds and &s;eas in our favour, yet had pre&s;erved us while we were in &s;uch apparent danger, beyond what could have been imagined. The States were not at all di&s;couraged with this hard beginning, but gave the nece&s;&s;ary orders for &s;upplying us with every thing that we needed. The Prince&s;s behaved her&s;elf at the <HI>Hague</HI> &s;uit|ably to what was expected from her. She ordered prayers four times a day, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted at them with great devotion. She &s;poke to no body of affairs, but was calm and &s;ilent. The States or|dered &s;ome of their body to give her an account of all their proceedings. She indeed an&s;wered little: But in that little &s;he gave them cau&s;e often to admire her judgment.</P>
<P>In <HI>England</HI> the Court &s;aw now, that it was in vain to di&s;|&s;emble <NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;ultati|ons in <HI>$word$|land.</HI></NOTE> or di&s;gui&s;e their fears any more. Great con&s;ultations were held there. The Earl of <HI>Melfort,</HI> and all the Papi&s;ts, propo&s;|ed the &s;eizing on all &s;u&s;pected per&s;ons, and the &s;ending them to <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Sunderland</HI> oppo&s;ed this vehement|ly. He &s;aid, it would not be po&s;&s;ible to &s;eize on many at the &s;ame time: And the &s;eizing on a few would alarm all the re&s;t: It would drive them in to the Prince, and furni&s;h them with a pretence for it: He propo&s;ed rather, that the King would do &s;uch popular things, as might give &s;ome content, and lay that fermentation with which the Nation was then, as it were, di|&s;tracted. This was at that time complied with: But all the Popi&s;h party continued upon this to charge Lord <HI>Sunderland,</HI> as one that was in the King's coun&s;els only to betray them; that had before diverted the offer of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>France,</HI> and now the &s;ecuring tho&s;e who were the mo&s;t likely to join and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Prince. By their importunities the King was at la&s;t &s;o prevail|ed on, that he turned him out of all his places: And Lord <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> was made Secretary of State. The Fleet was now put out, and was &s;o &s;trong, that, if they had met the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, pro|bably they would have been too hard for them, e&s;pecially con|&s;idering
<PB N="784" REF="804">
the great tran&s;port fleet that they were to cover. All the forces that were in <HI>Scotland</HI> were ordered into <HI>England:</HI> And that Kingdom was left in the hands of their Militia. Several Regiments came likewi&s;e from <HI>Ireland.</HI> So that the King's Ar|my was then about thirty thou&s;and &s;trong. But, in order to lay the heat that was rai&s;ed in the Nation, the King &s;ent for the Bi|&s;hops; and &s;et out the inju&s;tice of this unnatural inva&s;ion that the Prince was de&s;igning: He a&s;&s;ured them of his affections to the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and prote&s;ted, he had never intended to carry things further than to an equal liberty of con&s;cience: He de&s;ired, they would declare their abhorrence of this inva&s;i|on, and that they would offer him their advice, what was fit for him to do. They declined the point of abhorrence, and ad|vi&s;ed the pre&s;ent &s;ummoning a Parliament; and that in the mean while the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Commi&s;&s;ion might be broken, the pro|ceedings again&s;t the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Magdalen</HI> College might be rever&s;ed, and that the law might be again put in its channel. This they delivered with great gravity, and with a courage that recommended them to the whole Nation. There was an order &s;ent them from the King afterwards, requiring them to compo&s;e an office for the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. The prayers were &s;o well drawn, that even tho&s;e who wi&s;hed for the Prince might have joined in them. The Church party did now &s;hew their approbation of the Prince's expedition in &s;uch terms, that ma|ny were &s;urprized at it, both then, and &s;ince that time. They &s;poke openly in favour of it. They expre&s;&s;ed their grief to &s;ee the wind &s;o cro&s;s. They wi&s;hed for an Ea&s;t wind, which on that occa&s;ion was called the Prote&s;tant wind. They &s;poke with great &s;corn of all that the Court was then doing to regain the hearts of the Nation. And indeed the proceedings of the Court that way were &s;o cold, and &s;o forced, that few were like to be deceived by them, but tho&s;e who had a mind to be deceived. The writs for a Parliament were often ordered to be made rea|dy for the Seal, and were as often &s;topt. Some were &s;ealed, and given out: But they were quickly called in again. The old Charters were ordered to be re&s;tored again. <HI>Jefferies</HI> him&s;elf carried back the Charter of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and put on the appearances of joy and heartine&s;s when he gave it to them. All men &s;aw thro' that affectation: For he had rai&s;ed him&s;elf chiefly upon the advi&s;ing, or promoting, that matter of the &s;ur|render, and the forfeiture of the Charters. An order was al&s;o &s;ent to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> to put the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Mag|dalen</HI> College again in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Yet, that order not being executed when the news was brought that the Prince and his Fleet were blown back, it was countermanded; which plainly
<PB N="785" REF="805">
&s;hewed what it was that drove the Court into &s;o much compli|ance, and how long it was like to la&s;t.</P>
<P>The matter of the greate&s;t concern, and that could not be <NOTE PLACE="marg">Proofs brought for the birth of the Prince$ <HI>$word$</HI></NOTE> dropt, but was to be &s;upported, was the birth of the Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> And therefore the Court thought it nece&s;&s;ary, now in an after game, to offer &s;ome &s;atisfaction in that point. So a great meeting was called, not only of all the Privy Coun&s;el|lors and Judges, but of all the Nobility then in Town. To the&s;e the King complained of the great injury that was done both him and the Queen by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who ac|cu&s;ed them of &s;o black an impo&s;ture: He &s;aid, he believed there were few Princes then alive, who had been born in the pre|&s;ence of more witne&s;&s;es than were at his &s;on's birth: He had therefore called them together, that they might hear the proof of that matter. It was fir&s;t proved, that the Queen was deli|vered abed, while many were in the room; and that they &s;aw the child &s;oon after he was taken from the Queen by the mid|wife. But in this the midwife was the &s;ingle witne&s;s; for none of the Ladies had felt the child in the Queen's belly. The Counte&s;s of <HI>Sunderland</HI> did indeed depo&s;e, that the Queen cal|led to her to give her her hand, that &s;he might feel how the child lay, to which &s;he added, <HI>which I did;</HI> but did not &s;ay, whether &s;he felt the child, or not: And &s;he told the Duche&s;s of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> from whom I had it, that when &s;he put her hand into the bed, the Queen held it, and let it go no lower than her brea&s;ts. So that really &s;he felt nothing. And this depo|&s;ition, brought to make a &s;hew, was an evidence again&s;t the matter, rather than for it; and was a violent pre&s;umption of an impo&s;ture, and of an artifice to cover it. Many Ladies de|po&s;ed, that they had often &s;een the marks of milk on the Queen's linen, near her brea&s;ts. Two or three depo&s;ed, that they &s;aw it running out at the nipple. All the&s;e depo&s;ed, that they &s;aw milk before the pretended delivery. But none of them depo&s;ed concerning milk after the delivery, tho' nature &s;ends it then in greater abundance: And the Queen had it always in &s;uch a plen|ty, that &s;ome weeks pa&s;&s;ed after her delivery, before &s;he was quite freed from it. The Ladies did not name the time in which they &s;aw the milk, except one, who named the month of <HI>May.</HI> But, if the particulars mentioned before, that happen'd on <HI>Ea&s;ter Monday,</HI> are reflected on, and if it appears probable by the&s;e that the Queen mi&s;carried at that time; then all that the Ladies mentioned of milk in her brea&s;ts, particularly &s;he that fixed it to the month of <HI>May,</HI> might have followed upon that mi&s;car|riage, and be no proof concerning the late birth. Mrs. <HI>P$span$,</HI> the landre&s;s, depo&s;ed that &s;he took linen from the Queen's body
<PB N="786" REF="806">
once, which carried the marks of a delivery. But &s;he &s;poke only to one time. That was a main circum&s;tance. And, if it had been true, it mu&s;t have been often done, and was capa|ble of a more copious proof, &s;ince there is occa&s;ion for &s;uch things to be often looked on, and well con&s;idered. The Lady <HI>Wentworth</HI> was the &s;ingle witne&s;s that depo&s;ed, that &s;he had felt the child move in the Queen's belly. She was a Bed-chamber woman, as well as a &s;ingle witne&s;s: And &s;he fixed it on no time. If it was very early, &s;he might have been mi&s;taken: Or if it was before <HI>Ea&s;ter Monday,</HI> it might be true, and yet have no rela|tion to this birth. This was the &s;ub&s;tance of this evidence, which was ordered to be enrolled and printed. But, when it was publi&s;hed, it had a quite contrary effect to what the Court expected from it. The pre&s;umption of law before this was all in favour of the birth, &s;ince the parents owned the child: So that the proof lay on the other &s;ide, and ought to be offered by tho&s;e who called it in que&s;tion. But, now that this proof was brought, which was &s;o apparently defective, it did not le&s;|&s;en but increa&s;e the jealou&s;y with which the Nation was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed: For all people concluded, that, if the thing had been true, it mu&s;t have been ea&s;y to have brought a much more co|pious proof than was now publi&s;hed to the world. It was much ob&s;erved, that Prince&s;s <HI>Anne</HI> was not pre&s;ent. She indeed ex|cu&s;ed her&s;elf. She thought &s;he was breeding: And all motion was forbidden her. None believed that to be the true rea&s;on; for it was thought, that the going from one apartment of the Court to another could not hurt her. So it was looked on as a colour that &s;hewed &s;he did not believe the thing, and that therefore &s;he would not by her being pre&s;ent &s;eem to give any credit to it.</P>
<P>This was the &s;tate of affairs in <HI>England,</HI> while we lay at <HI>Helvoet-Sluys,</HI> where we continued till the fir&s;t of <HI>November.</HI> Here <HI>Wildman</HI> created a new di&s;turbance. He plainly had a &s;hew of courage, but was, at lea&s;t then, a coward. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> with an opinion, that the de&s;ign was now irrecoverably lo&s;t. This was entertained by many, who were willing to hearken to any propo&s;ition that &s;et danger at a di&s;|tance from them&s;elves. They were &s;till magnifying the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, and undervaluing the <HI>Dutch.</HI> They went &s;o far in this, that they propo&s;ed to the Prince, that <HI>Herbert</HI> &s;hould be order|ed to go over to the coa&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> and either &s;ight the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, or force them in: And in that ca&s;e the Tran|&s;port Fleet might venture over; which otherwi&s;e they thought could not be &s;afely done. This &s;ome urged with &s;uch earne&s;t|ne&s;s, that nothing but the Prince's authority, and <HI>Schomberg</HI>'s
<PB N="787" REF="807">
credit, could have with&s;tood it. The Prince told them, the &s;ea|&s;on was now &s;o far &s;pent, that the lo&s;ing of more time was the lo&s;ing the whole de&s;ign: Fleets might lie long in view of one another, before it could be po&s;&s;ible for them to come to an engagement, tho' both &s;ides equally de&s;ired it; but much longer, if any one of them avoided it: It was not po&s;&s;ible to keep the Army, e&s;pe|cially the hor&s;e, long at &s;ea: And it was no ea&s;y matter to take them all out, and to &s;hip them again: After the wind had &s;tood &s;o long in the We&s;t, there was rea&s;on to hope it would turn to the Ea&s;t: And when that &s;hould come, no time was to be lo&s;t: For it would &s;ometimes blow &s;o fre&s;h in a few days as to freeze up the river; &s;o that it would not be po&s;&s;ible to get out all the winter long. With the&s;e things he rather &s;ilenced than quiet|ed them. All this while the men of war were &s;till riding at &s;ea, it being a continued &s;torm for &s;ome weeks. The Prince &s;ent out &s;everal advice boats with orders to them to come in. But they could not come up to them. On the twenty &s;eventh of <HI>October</HI> there was for &s;ix hours together a mo&s;t dreadful &s;torm: So that there were few among us, that did not conclude, that the be&s;t part of the Fleet, and by con&s;equence that the whole de&s;ign, was lo&s;t. Many, that have pa&s;t for Heroes, yet &s;hew|ed then the agonies of fear in their looks, and whole deport|ment. The Prince &s;till retained his u&s;ual calmne&s;s, and the &s;ame tranquillity of &s;pirit, that I had ob&s;erved in him in his happie&s;t days. On the twenty eighth it calmed a little, and our Fleet came all in, to our great joy. The rudder of one third rate was broken: And that was all the hurt that the &s;torm had done. At la&s;t the much long|ed for Ea&s;t wind came. And &s;o hard a thing it was to &s;et &s;o va&s;t a body in motion, that two days of this wind were lo&s;t before all could be quite ready.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of <HI>November O. S.</HI> we &s;ailed out with the even|ing <NOTE PLACE="marg">We &s;ailed out more happily a &s;e|cond time.</NOTE> tide; but made little way that night, that &s;o our Fleet might come out, and move in order. We tried next day till noon, if it was po&s;&s;ible to &s;ail Northward: But the wind was &s;o &s;trong, and full in the Ea&s;t, that we could not move that way. About noon the &s;ignal was given to &s;teer We&s;tward. This wind not only diverted us from that unhappy cour&s;e, but it kept the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet in the river: So that it was not po&s;&s;ible for them to come out, tho' they were come down as far as to the Gun|fleet. By this means we had the &s;ea open to us, with a fair wind, and a &s;afe navigation. On the third we pa&s;t between <HI>Dover</HI> and <HI>Calais,</HI> and before night came in &s;ight of the $&s;le of of <HI>Wight.</HI> The next day being the day in which the Prince was both born and married, he fancied, if he could land that day, it would look au&s;picious to the Army, and animate the
<PB N="788" REF="808">
&s;oldiers. But we all, who con&s;idered, that the day following, being Gunpowder Trea&s;on day, our landing that day might have a good effect on the minds of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, were better plea&s;ed to &s;ee that we could land no &s;ooner. <HI>Torbay</HI> was thought the be&s;t place for our great Fleet to lie in: And it was re&s;olved to land the Army, where it could be be&s;t done near it; reckoning, that being at &s;uch a di&s;tance from <HI>London,</HI> we could provide our &s;elves with hor&s;es, and put every thing in order before the King could march his Army towards us, and that we &s;hould lie &s;ome time at <HI>Exeter</HI> for the refre&s;hing our men. I was in the &s;hip, with the Prince's other dome&s;ticks, that went in the van of the whole Fleet. At noon on the fourth <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> came on board us with the be&s;t of all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pilots that they had brought over. He gave him the &s;teering of the &s;hip; and ordered him to be &s;ure to &s;ail &s;o, that next morning we &s;hould be &s;hort of <HI>Dartmouth:</HI> For it was intended that &s;ome of the &s;hips &s;hould land there, and that the re&s;t &s;hould &s;ail in|to <HI>Torbay.</HI> The pilot thought, he could not be mi&s;taken in mea&s;uring our cour&s;e; and believed that he certainly kept with|in orders, till the morning &s;hewed us we were pa&s;t <HI>Torbay</HI> and <HI>Dartmouth.</HI> The wind, tho' it had abated much of its fir&s;t vio|lence, yet was &s;till full in the Ea&s;t: So now it &s;eemed nece&s;|&s;ary for us to &s;ail on to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> which mu&s;t have engag|ed us in a long and tedious campaign in winter, thro' a very ill Country. Nor were we &s;ure to be received at <HI>Plymouth.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Bath,</HI> who was Governor, had &s;ent by <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> a pro|mi&s;e to the Prince to come and join him: Yet it was not like|ly, that he would be &s;o forward as to receive us at our fir&s;t coming. The delays he made afterwards, pretending that he was managing the garri&s;on, whereas he was indeed &s;taying till he &s;aw how the matter was like to be decided, &s;hewed us how fatal it had proved, if we had been forced to &s;ail on to <HI>Plymouth.</HI> But while <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> was in no &s;mall di&s;order, after he &s;aw the pi|lot's error, (upon which he bid me go to my prayers, for all was lo&s;t,) and as he was ordering the boat to be cleared to go aboard the Prince, on a &s;udden to all our wonder it calmed a little. And then the wind turned into the South: And a &s;oft and happy gale of wind carried in the whole Fleet in four hours time into <HI>Torhay.</HI> Immediately as many landed as conveniently could. <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> As &s;oon as the Prince and Mar&s;hal <HI>Schomberg</HI> got to &s;hore, they were furni&s;hed with &s;uch hor&s;es as the village of <HI>Broxholme</HI> could afford; and rode up to view the grounds which they found as convenient as could be imagined for the foot in that &s;ea&s;on. It was not a cold night: Otherwi&s;e the &s;oldiers, who had been kept warm aboard, might have &s;uffered much by it. As &s;oon
<PB N="789" REF="809">
as I landed, I made what ha&s;te I could to the place where the Prince was; who took me heartily by the hand, and a&s;ked me, if I would not now believe prede&s;tination. I told him, I would ne|ver forget that providence of God, which had appeared &s;o &s;ig|nally on this occa&s;ion. He was cheerfuller than ordinary. Yet he returned &s;oon to his u&s;ual gravity. The Prince &s;ent for all the fi&s;hermen of the place; and a&s;ked them, which was the pro|pere&s;t place for landing his hor&s;e, which all apprehended would be a tedious bu&s;ine&s;s, and might hold &s;ome days. But next morning he was &s;hewed a place, a quarter of a mile below the village, where the &s;hips could be brought very near the land, again&s;t a good &s;hore, and the hor&s;es would not be put to &s;wim above twenty yards. This proved to be &s;o happy for our land|ing, tho' we came to it by meer accident, that, if we had or|dered the whole I&s;land round to be &s;ounded, we could not have found a properer place for it. There was a dead calm all that morning: And in three hour's time all our hor&s;e were landed, with as much baggage as was nece&s;&s;ary till we got to <HI>Exeter.</HI> The artillery and heavy baggage were left aboard, and ordered to <HI>Top&s;ham</HI> the &s;ea-port to <HI>Exeter.</HI> All that belonged to us was &s;o &s;oon and &s;o happily landed, that by the next day at noon we were in full march, and marched four miles that night. We had from thence twenty miles to <HI>Exeter:</HI> And we re&s;olved to make ha&s;te thither. But, as we were now happily landed, and marching, we &s;aw new and unthought of characters of a favourable providence of God watching over us. We had no &s;ooner got thus di&s;engaged from our Fleet, than a new and great &s;torm blew from the We&s;t; from which our Fleet, being covered by the land, could receive no prejudice: But the King's Fleet had got out as the wind calmed, and in pur&s;uit of us was come as far as the i&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> when this contrary wind turned upon them. They tried what they could to pur&s;ue us: But they were &s;o &s;hattered by &s;ome days of this &s;torm, that they were forced to go into <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> and were no more fit for &s;ervice that year. This was a greater happine&s;s than we were then aware of: For the Lord <HI>Dartmouth</HI> a&s;&s;ured me &s;ome time after, that, whatever &s;tories we had heard and believed, either of Officers or &s;eamen, he was confident they would all have fought very heartily. But now, by the immediate hand of hea|ven, we were ma&s;ters of the &s;ea without a blow. I never found a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;uper&s;tition in my temper: I was rather inclined to be philo&s;ophical upon all occa&s;ions. Yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that this &s;trange ordering of the winds and &s;ea&s;ons, ju&s;t to change as our affairs required it, could not but make deep impre&s;&s;ions on me, as well as on all that ob&s;erved it. Tho&s;e $amous v$span$s

of <HI>Claudian</HI> &s;eemed to be more applicable to the Prince, than to him they were made on:</P>

<P>The Prince made ha&s;te to <HI>Exeter,</HI> where he &s;taid ten days, both for refre&s;hing his troops, and for giving the Country time to &s;hew their affections. Both the Clergy and Magi&s;trates of <HI>Exeter</HI> were very fearful, and very backward. The Bi&s;hop and the Dean ran away. And the Clergy &s;tood off, tho' they were &s;ent for, and very gently &s;poke to by the Prince. The truth was, the doctrines of Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience and Non-re&s;i&s;tance had been carried &s;o far, and preached &s;o much, that Clergymen either could not all on the &s;udden get out of that entanglement, into which they had by long thinking and &s;peaking all one way in|volved them&s;elves, or they were a&s;hamed to make &s;o quick a turn. Yet care was taken to protect them and their hou&s;es every where: So that no &s;ort of violence nor rudene&s;s was of|fered to any of them. The Prince gave me full authority to do this: And I took &s;o particular a care of it, that we heard of no complaints. The Army was kept under &s;uch an exact di&s;cipline, that every thing was paid for where it was demand|ed, tho' the &s;old$ers were contented with &s;uch moderate enter|tainment, that the people generally a&s;ked but little for what they did ea$. We &s;taid a week at <HI>Exeter,</HI> before any of the Gen|tlemen of the country about came in to the Prince. Every day &s;ome per&s;ons of condition came from other parts. The fir&s;t were the Lord <HI>$word$</HI> the elde&s;t &s;on of the Earl of <HI>Rivers,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Wharton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI>'s brother, and the Earl of <HI>Abington.</HI></P>
<P>The King came down to <HI>Saltsbury,</HI> and &s;ent his troops twen|ty <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> miles $urther. Of the&s;e, three Regiments of hor&s;e and dra|goons were drawn on by their Officers, the Lord <HI>Co$span$bury</HI> and Coll. <HI>$word$,</HI> on de&s;ign to come over to the Prince. Advice $word$ &s;ent to the Prince of this. But becau&s;e the&s;e Officers were not $word$ of their &s;ubalterns, the Prince ordered a body of his men to advance, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in ca&s;e any re&s;i&s;tance was made. They were within twenty miles of <HI>Exeter,</HI> and within two miles of the body that the Prince had &s;ent to join them, when a whi&s;per r$n about among them that they were betrayed. Lord <HI>$word$</HI> had not the pre&s;ence of mind that &s;o critical a thing required. So they $ell in confu&s;ion, and many rode back. Yet
<PB N="791" REF="811">
one Regiment came over in a body, and with them about a hundred of the other two. This gave us great courage; and &s;hewed us, that we had not been deceived in what was told us of the inclinations of the King's Army. Yet, on the other hand, tho&s;e who &s;tudied to &s;upport the King's &s;pirit by flatteries told him, that in this he &s;aw that he might tru&s;t his Army, &s;ince the&s;e who intended to carry over tho&s;e Regiments, were forced to manage it with &s;o much artifice, and dur&s;t not di&s;cover their de&s;ign either to Officers or &s;oldiers; and that, as &s;oon as they perceived it, the greater part of them had turned back. The King wanted &s;upport: For his &s;pirits &s;unk extreamly. His blood was in &s;uch fermentation, that he was bleeding much at the no&s;e, which returned oft upon him every day. He &s;ent many &s;pies over to us. They all took his money, and came and join|ed them&s;elves to the Prince, none of them returning to him. So that he had no intelligence brought him of what the Prince was doing, but what common reports brought him, which mag|nified our numbers, and made him think we were coming near him, while we were &s;till at <HI>Exeter.</HI> He heard that the City of <HI>London</HI> was very unquiet. News were brought him, that the Earls of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Danby,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Lumley,</HI> were draw|ing great bodies together, and that both <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> had declared for the Prince. The Lord <HI>Delamere</HI> had rai&s;ed a Re|giment in <HI>Che&s;hire.</HI> And the body of the Nation did every where di&s;cover their inclinations for the Prince &s;o evidently, that the King &s;aw he had nothing to tru&s;t to, but his Army. And the ill di&s;po&s;ition among them was &s;o apparent, that he reckoned he could not depend on them. So that he lo&s;t both heart and head at once. But that which gave him the la&s;t and mo&s;t confounding &s;troke was, that the Lord <HI>Churchill</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Grafton</HI> left him, and came and joined the Prince at <HI>Axmin&s;ter,</HI> twenty miles on that &s;ide of <HI>Exeter.</HI> After this he could not know on whom he could depend. The Duke of <HI>Grafton</HI> was one of King <HI>Charles</HI>'s &s;ons by the Duche&s;s of <HI>Cleve|land.</HI> He had been &s;ometime at &s;ea, and was a gallant but rough man. He had more &s;pirit than any one of the King's &s;ons. He made an an&s;wer to the King about this time, that was much talked of. The King took notice of &s;omewhat in his behaviour that looked factious: And he &s;aid, he was &s;ure he could not pretend to act upon principles of con&s;cience; for he had been &s;o ill bred, that as he knew little of religion &s;o he regarded it le&s;s. But he an&s;wered the King, that, tho' he had little con&s;cience, yet he was of a party that had con&s;cience. Soon after that, Prince <HI>George,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the Lord <HI>D$span$|rick</HI> the Duke of <HI>Queensbury</HI>'s elde&s;t &s;on, left him, and came over
<PB N="792" REF="812">
to the Prince, and joined him, when he was come as far as the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>'s hou&s;e at <HI>Sherburn.</HI> When the news came to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> the Prince&s;s was &s;o &s;truck with the apprehen&s;ions of the King's di&s;plea&s;ure, and of the ill effects that it might have, that &s;he &s;aid to the Lady <HI>Churchill,</HI> that &s;he could not bear the thoughts of it, and would leap out at window rather than venture on it. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> was then lodged very &s;ecretly in <HI>Suffolk</HI> &s;treet. So the Lady <HI>Churchill,</HI> who knew where he was, went to him, and concerted with him the method of the Prin|ce&s;s's withdrawing from the Court. The Prince&s;s went &s;ooner to bed than ordinary. And about midnight &s;he went down a back&s;tairs from her clo&s;et, attended only by the Lady <HI>Churchill,</HI> in &s;uch ha&s;te that they carried nothing with them. They were waited for by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> who carried them to the Earl of <HI>Dor&s;et</HI>'s, who&s;e Lady furni&s;hed them with every thing. And &s;o they went Northward, as far as <HI>Northampton;</HI> where that Earl attended on them with all re&s;pect, and quickly brought a body of hor&s;e to &s;erve for a guard to the Prince&s;s. And in a little while a &s;mall Army was formed about her, who cho&s;e to be commanded by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London;</HI> of which he too ea&s;ily accepted.</P>
<P>The&s;e things put the King in an unexpre&s;&s;ible confu&s;ion. He &s;aw him&s;elf now for&s;aken, not only by tho&s;e whom he had tru&s;ted and favoured mo&s;t, but even by his own children. And the Army was in &s;uch di&s;traction, that there was not any one body that &s;eemed entirely united and firm to him. A fooli&s;h ballad was made at that time, treating the Papi&s;ts, and chiefly the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> in a very ridiculous manner, which had a bur|den, &s;aid to be <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> words, <HI>lero lero lilibulero,</HI> that made an im|pre&s;&s;ion on the Army, that cannot be well imagined by tho&s;e who &s;aw it not. The whole Army, and at la&s;t all people both in city and country, were &s;inging it perpetually. And perhaps never had &s;o &s;light a thing &s;o great an effect.</P>
<P>While the Prince &s;taid at <HI>Exeter,</HI> the rabble of the people <NOTE PLACE="marg">A$ $span$|tion among tho&s;e who came to the <HI>Prince</HI></NOTE> came in to him in great numbers. So that he could have rai&s;ed many Regiments of foot, if there had been any occa&s;ion for them. But what he under&s;tood of the temper the King's Army was in, made him judge it was not nece&s;&s;ary to arm greater numbers. After he had &s;taid eight days at <HI>Exeter, Seimour</HI> came in with &s;everal other Gentlemen of quality and e&s;tate. As &s;oon as he had been with the Prince, he &s;ent to &s;eek for me. When I came to him, he a&s;ked me, why we had not an A&s;&s;ociation &s;igned by all that came to us, &s;ince, till we had that done, we were as a rope of &s;and: Men might leave us when they plea&s;ed, and we had them under no tie: Whereas, if they &s;igned an A&s;&s;o|ciation,
<PB N="793" REF="813">
they would reckon them&s;elves bound to &s;tick to us. I an&s;wered, it was becau&s;e we had not a man of his authority and credit to offer and &s;upport &s;uch an advice. I went from him to the Prince, who approved of the motion; as did al&s;o the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and all that were with us. So I was order|ed to draw it. It was, in few words, an engagement to &s;tick together in pur&s;uing the ends of the Prince's declaration; and that, if any attempt &s;hould be made on his per&s;on, it &s;hould be revenged on all by whom or from whom any &s;uch attempt &s;hould be made. This was agreed to by all about the Prince. So it was engro&s;&s;ed in parchment, and &s;igned by all tho&s;e that came in to him. The Prince put <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Exeter</HI> under <HI>Sei|mour</HI>'s government, who was Recorder of <HI>Exeter.</HI> And he ad|vanced with his Army, leaving a &s;mall garri&s;on there with his heavy artillery under Coll. <HI>Gib&s;on,</HI> whom he made Deputy Go|vernor as to the military part.</P>
<P>At <HI>Crookhorn,</HI> Dr. <HI>Finch,</HI> &s;on to the Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ea,</HI> then made <NOTE PLACE="marg">The $span$ in <HI>Oxford</HI> &s;ent to $word$</NOTE> Warden of All-Souls College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> was &s;ent to the Prince from &s;ome of the Heads of Colleges; a&s;&s;uring him, that they would declare for him, and inviting him to come thither, tell|ing him, that their plate &s;hould be at his &s;ervice, if he need|ed it. This was a &s;udden turn from tho&s;e principles that they had carried &s;o high a few years before. The Prince had de|&s;igned to have &s;ecured <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> and <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> and &s;o to have gone to <HI>Oxford,</HI> the whole We&s;t being then in his hands, if there had been any appearance of a &s;tand to be made again&s;t him by the King and his Army; for, the King being &s;o much &s;uperior to to him in hor&s;e, it was not advi&s;able to march thro' the great plains of <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Wilt&s;hire.</HI> But the King's precipitated return to <HI>London</HI> put an end to this precaution. The Earl of <HI>Bath</HI> had prevailed with the garri&s;on of <HI>Plymouth:</HI> And they declared for the Prince. So now all behind him was &s;afe. When he came to <HI>Sherburn,</HI> all <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire</HI> came in a body, and joined him. He re&s;olved to make all the ha&s;te he could to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> where things were in a high fermentation.</P>
<P>A bold man ventured to draw and publi&s;h another declara|tion <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> in the Prince's name. It was penned with great &s;pirit&punc; And it had as great an effect. It &s;et forth the de&s;perate de|&s;igns of the Papi&s;ts, and the extream danger the Nation was in by their means, and required all per&s;ons immediately to fall on &s;uch Papi&s;ts as were in any employments, and to turn them out, and to &s;ecure all &s;trong places, and to do every thing el&s;e that was in their power to execute the laws, and to bring all things again into their proper channels. This &s;et all men at work: For no doubt was made, that it was truly the Prince's declaration.
<PB N="794" REF="814">
But he knew nothing of it. And it was never known, who was the author of &s;o bold a thing. No per&s;on ever claimed the merit of it: For, tho' it had an amazing effect, yet, it &s;eems, he that contrived it apprehended, that the Prince would not be well plea&s;ed with the author of &s;uch an impo&s;ture in his Name. The King was under &s;uch a con&s;ternation, that he neither knew what to re&s;olve on, nor whom to tru&s;t. This pretend|ed declaration put the City in &s;uch a flame, that it was car|ried to the Lord Mayor, and he was required to execute it. The prentices got together, and were falling upon all Ma&s;s hou&s;es, and committing many irregular things. Yet their fury was &s;o well governed, and &s;o little re&s;i&s;ted that no other mi&s;|chief was done: No blood was &s;hed.</P>
<P>The King now &s;ent for all the Lords in Town, that were known <NOTE PLACE="marg">A treaty be|gun with the Prince.</NOTE> to be firm Prote&s;tants. And, upon &s;peaking to &s;ome of them in pri|vate, they advi&s;ed him to call a general meeting of all the Pri|vy Coun&s;ellors, and Peers, to a&s;k their advice, what was fit to be done. All agreed in one opinion, that it was fit to &s;end Com|mi&s;&s;ioners to the Prince to treat with him. This went much again&s;t the King's own inclinations: Yet the dejection he was in, and the de&s;perate &s;tate of his affairs, forced him to con&s;ent to it. So the Marquis of <HI>Hallifax,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Godolphin,</HI> were ordered to go to the Prince, and to a&s;k him, what it was that he demanded. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> reflected the mo&s;t on the King's former conduct of any in that a&s;&s;embly, not without &s;ome indecent and in&s;olent words, which were generally con|demned. He expected, as was &s;aid, to be one of the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners: And, upon his not being named, he came and met the Prince near <HI>Salisbury.</HI> Yet he &s;ugge&s;ted &s;o many peevi&s;h and peculiar things, when he came, that &s;ome &s;u&s;pected, all this was but collu&s;ion, and that he was &s;ent to rai&s;e a faction among tho&s;e that were about the Prince. The Lords &s;ent to the Prince to know where they &s;hould wait on him: And he named <HI>Hun|ger$ord.</HI> When they came thither, and had delivered their me&s;|&s;age, the Prince called all the Peers and others of chief note about him, and advi&s;ed with them what an&s;wer &s;hould be made. A day was taken to con&s;ider of an an&s;wer. The Mar|quis of <HI>Hallifax</HI> &s;ent for me. But the Prince &s;aid, tho' he would &s;u&s;pect nothing from our meeting, others might. So I did not &s;peak with him in private, but in the hearing of others. Yet he took occa&s;ion to a&s;k me, &s;o as no body ob&s;erved it, if we had a mind to have the King in our hands. I &s;aid, by no means; for we would not hurt his per&s;on. He a&s;ked next, what if he had a mind to go away. I &s;aid, nothing was &s;o much to be wi&s;hed for. This I told the Prince. And he approved of both my
<PB N="795" REF="815">
an&s;wers. The Prince ordered the Earls of <HI>Oxford, Shrewsbury,</HI> and <HI>Clarendon</HI> to treat with the Lords the King had &s;ent. And they delivered the Prince's an&s;wer to them on <HI>Sunday</HI> the eighth of <HI>December.</HI></P>
<P>He de&s;ired a Parliament might be pre&s;ently called, that no men &s;hould continue in any employment, who were not qualified by law, and had not taken the Te&s;ts, that the Tower of <HI>London</HI> might be put in the keeping of the City; that the Fleet, and all the &s;trong places of the Kingdom, might be put in the hands of Prote&s;tants; that a proportion of the revenue might be &s;et off for the pay of the Prince's Army; and that during the &s;itting of the Parliament, the Armies of both &s;ides might not come within twenty miles of <HI>London;</HI> but, that the Prince might come on to <HI>London,</HI> and have the &s;ame number of his guards about him, that the King kept about his per&s;on. The Lords &s;eem|ed to be very well &s;atisfied with this an&s;wer. They &s;ent it up by an expre&s;s, and went back next day to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>But now &s;trange coun&s;els were &s;ugge&s;ted to the King and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King left the Kingdom.</NOTE> Queen. The Prie&s;ts, and all the violent Papi&s;ts, &s;aw a treaty was now opened. They knew, that they mu&s;t be the &s;acrifice. The whole de&s;ign of Popery mu&s;t be given up, without any hope of being able in an age to think of bringing it on again. Severe laws would be made again&s;t them. And all tho&s;e who intended to &s;tick to the King, and to pre&s;erve him, would go in|to tho&s;e laws with a particular zeal: So that they, and their hopes, mu&s;t be now given up, and &s;acrificed for ever. They infu&s;ed all this into the Queen. They &s;aid, &s;he would certain|ly be impeached: And witne&s;&s;es would be &s;et up again&s;t her, and her &s;on: The King's Mother had been impeached in the long Parliament: And &s;he was to look for nothing but violence. So the Queen took up a &s;udden re&s;olution of going to <HI>France</HI> with the child. The midwife, together with all who were a&s;|&s;i&s;ting at the birth, were al&s;o carried over, or &s;o di&s;po&s;ed of, that it could never be learned what became of them after|wards. The Queen prevailed with the King, not only to con|&s;ent to this, but to promi&s;e to go quickly after her. He was only to &s;tay a day or two after her, in hope that the &s;hadow of authority that was &s;till left in him might keep things &s;o quiet, that &s;he might have an undi&s;turbed pa&s;&s;age. So &s;he went to <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> And from thence, in a man of war, &s;he went over to <HI>France,</HI> the King re&s;olving to follow her in di&s;gui&s;e. Care was al&s;o taken to &s;end all the Prie&s;ts away. The King &s;taid long enough to get the Prince's an&s;wer. And when he had read it, he &s;aid, he did not expect &s;o good terms. He order|ed the Lord Chancellor to come to him next morning. But
<PB N="796" REF="816">
he had called &s;ecretly for the Great Seal. And the next morn|ing, being the tenth of <HI>December,</HI> about three in the morning he went away in di&s;gui&s;e with Sir <HI>Edward Hales,</HI> who&s;e &s;ervant he &s;eemed to be. They pa&s;t the river, and flung the Great Seal into it; which was &s;ome months after found by a fi&s;herman near <HI>Fox-Hall.</HI> The King went down to a mi&s;erable fi&s;her boat, that <HI>Hales</HI> had provided for carrying them over to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Thus a great King, who had a good Army and a &s;trong <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is much cen&s;ured.</NOTE> Fleet, did choo&s;e rather to abandon all, than either to expo&s;e him&s;elf to any danger with that part of the Army that was &s;till firm to him, or to &s;tay and &s;ee the i&s;&s;ue of a Parliament. Some put this mean and unaccountable re&s;olution on a want of courage. Others thought it was the effect of an ill con&s;cience, and of &s;ome black thing under which he could not now &s;up|port him&s;elf. And they who cen&s;ured it the mo&s;t moderately, &s;aid, that it &s;hewed, that his Prie&s;ts had more regard to them|&s;elves than to him; and that he con&s;idered their intere&s;t more than his own; and that he cho&s;e rather to wander abroad with them, and to try what he could do by a <HI>French</HI> force to &s;ub|due his people, than to &s;tay at home, and be &s;hut up within the bounds of law, and be brought under an incapacity of do|ing more mi&s;chief; which they &s;aw was nece&s;&s;ary to quiet tho&s;e fears and jealou&s;ies, for which his bad government had given &s;o much occa&s;ion. It &s;eemed very unaccountable, &s;ince he was re&s;olved to go, that he did not choo&s;e rather to go in one of his Yatchs or Fregats, than to expo&s;e him&s;elf in &s;o dangerous and ignominious a manner. It was not po&s;&s;ible to put a good con&s;truction on any part of the di&s;honourable &s;cene which he then acted.</P>
<P>With this his reign ended: For this was a plain de&s;erting his people, and the expo&s;ing the Nation to the pillage of an Army, which he had ordered the Earl of <HI>Fever&s;ham</HI> to di&s;band. And the doing this without paying them, was the letting &s;o many arm|ed men loo&s;e upon the Nation; who might have done much mi&s;chief, if the execution of tho&s;e orders that he left behind him had not been &s;topped. I &s;hall continue the recital of all that pa&s;t in this <HI>Interregnum,</HI> till the Throne, which he now left empty, was filled.</P>
<P>He was not got far, when &s;ome fi&s;hermen of <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> who <NOTE PLACE="marg">But is $line$ back.</NOTE> were watching for &s;uch Prie&s;ts, and other delinquents, as they fancied were making their e&s;cape, came up to him. And they, knowing Sir <HI>Edward Hales,</HI> took both the King and him, and brought them to <HI>Fever&s;ham.</HI> The King told them who he was. And that flying about brought a va&s;t croud together, to
<PB N="797" REF="817">
look on that a&s;toni&s;hing in&s;tance of the uncertainty of all world|ly greatne&s;s; when he who had ruled three Kingdoms, and might have been the arbiter of all <HI>Europe,</HI> was now in &s;uch mean hands, and &s;o low an equipage. The people of the town were extremely di&s;ordered with this unlooked for accident: And, tho' for a while they kept him as a pri&s;oner, yet they quick|ly changed that into as much re&s;pect as they could po&s;&s;ibly pay him. Here was an accident that &s;eemed of no great con|&s;equence. Yet all the &s;trugglings which that party have made ever &s;ince that time to this day, which from him were called afterwards the Jacobites, did ri&s;e out of this: For, if he had got clear away, by all that could be judged, he would not have had a party left: All would have agreed, that here was a de|&s;ertion, and that therefore the Nation was free, and at liberty to &s;ecure it &s;elf. But what followed upon this gave them a co|lour to &s;ay, that he was forced away, and driven out. Till now, he &s;carce had a party, but among the Papi&s;ts. But from this incident a party grew up, that has been long very active for his intere&s;ts. As &s;oon as it was known at <HI>London</HI> that the King was gone, the prentices and the rabble, who had been a little quieted when they &s;aw a treaty on foot between the King and the Prince, now broke out again upon all &s;u&s;pected hou&s;es, where they believed there was either Prie&s;ts or Papi&s;ts. They made great havock of many places, not &s;paring the hou&s;es of Emba&s;&s;adors. But none were killed, no hou&s;es burnt, nor were any robberies committed. Never was &s;o much fury &s;een under &s;o much management. <HI>Jefferies,</HI> finding the King was gone, &s;aw what rea&s;on he had to look to him&s;elf: And, apprehending that he was now expo&s;ed to the rage of the people, whom he had provoked with &s;o particular a brutality, he had di&s;gui&s;ed him|&s;elf to make his e&s;cape. But he fell into the hands of &s;ome who knew him. He was in&s;ulted by them with as much &s;corn and rudene&s;s as they could invent. And, after many hours to&s;|&s;ing him about, he was carried to the Lord Mayor; whom they charged to commit him to the Tower, which the Lord <HI>$word$</HI> had then &s;eized, and in it had declared for the Prince. The Lord Mayor was &s;o &s;truck with the terror of this rude popu|lace, and with the di&s;grace of a man who had made all peo|ple tremble before him, that he fell into &s;its upon it, of which he died &s;oon after.</P>
<P>To prevent the further growth of &s;uch di&s;orders, he called <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> a meeting of the Privy Coun&s;ellors and Peers, who met at <HI>Guild-Ha$l.</HI> The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> was there. They gave a &s;trict charge for keeping the peace; and agreed to &s;end an invitation to the Prince, de&s;$$ing him to come and take
<PB N="798" REF="818">
the government of the Nation into his hands, till a Parliament &s;hould meet to bring all matters to a ju&s;t and full &s;ettlement. This they all &s;igned; and &s;ent it to the Prince by the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> the Vi&s;count of <HI>Weymouth,</HI> the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Culpepper.</HI> The Prince went on from <HI>Hungerford</HI> to <HI>Newbury,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Abington,</HI> re&s;olving to have gone to <HI>Oxford</HI> to receive the compliments of the Univer&s;ity, and to meet the Prince&s;s <HI>Anne</HI> who was coming thither. At <HI>Abington</HI> he was &s;urprized with the news of the &s;trange cata&s;trophe of affairs now at <HI>London,</HI> the King's de&s;ertion, and the di&s;orders which the City and neighbourhood of <HI>London</HI> were falling in|to. One came from <HI>London,</HI> and brought him the news, which he knew not well how to believe, till he had an expre&s;s &s;ent him from the Lords, who had been with him from the King. Upon this the Prince &s;aw, how nece&s;&s;ary it was to make all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to <HI>London.</HI> So he &s;ent to <HI>Oxford,</HI> to excu&s;e his not coming thither, and to offer the A&s;&s;ociation to them, which was &s;igned by almo&s;t all the Heads, and the chief men of the Univer&s;ity; even by tho&s;e, who, being di&s;appointed in the pre|ferments they a&s;pired to, became afterwards his mo&s;t implacable enemies.</P>
<P>Hitherto the expedition had been pro&s;perous, beyond all that could have been expected. There had been but two &s;mall en|gagements, during this un&s;ea&s;onable campaign. One was at <HI>$span$kington</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> where an advanced party of the Prince's met one of the King's that was thrice their number: Yet they drove them before them into a much greater body, where they were overpowered with numbers. Some were killed of both &s;ides. But there were more pri&s;oners taken of the Prince's men. Yet, tho' the lo&s;s was of his &s;ide, the courage that his men &s;hew|ed in &s;o a great an inequality as to number, made us reckon that we gained more than we lo&s;t on that occa&s;ion. Another action happen'd at <HI>Reading,</HI> where the King had a con&s;idera|ble body, who, as &s;ome of the Prince's men advanced, fell in|to a great di&s;order, and ran away. One of the Prince's Of|ficers was &s;hot. He was a Papi&s;t: And the Prince in con&s;idera|ration of his religion was willing to leave him behind him in <HI>Holland:</HI> But he very earne&s;tly begged he might come over with his company: And he was the only Officer that was killed in the whole expedition.</P>
<P>Upon the news of the King's de&s;ertion, it was propo&s;ed that <NOTE PLACE="marg">$line$</NOTE> the Prince &s;hould go on with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to <HI>London.</HI> But that was not advi&s;able. For the King's Army lay &s;o &s;cattered thro' the road all the way to <HI>London,</HI> that it was not fit for him to advance fa&s;ter, than as his troops marched before him&punc;
<PB N="799" REF="819">
Otherwi&s;e, any re&s;olute Officer might have &s;eized or killed him. Tho', if it had not been for that danger, a great deal of mi&s;|chief, that followed, would have been prevented by his &s;peedy advance: For now began that turn, to which all the difficul|ties, that did afterwards di&s;order our affairs, may be ju&s;tly im|puted. Two Gentlemen of <HI>Kent</HI> came to <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> the morning after the Prince came thither. They were addre&s;&s;ed to me. And they told me of the accident at <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> and de&s;ired to know the Prince's plea&s;ure upon it. I was affected with this di&s;mal rever&s;e of the fortune of a great Prince, more than I think fit to expre&s;s. I went immediately to <HI>Benthink,</HI> and wak|ned him, and got him to go in to the Prince, and let him know what had happen'd, that &s;ome order might be pre&s;ently given for the &s;ecurity of the King's per&s;on, and for taking him out of the hands of a rude multitude, who &s;aid, they would obey no orders but &s;uch as came from the Prince. The Prince or|dered <HI>Zuyle&s;tein</HI> to go immediately to <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> and to &s;ee the King &s;afe, and at full liberty to go whither&s;oever he plea&s;ed. But, as &s;oon as the news of the King's being at <HI>Fever&s;ham</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI> all the indignation that people had formerly con|ceived again&s;t him was turned to pity and compa&s;&s;ion. The Privy Council met upon it. Some moved, that he &s;hould be &s;ent for. Others &s;aid, he was King, and might &s;end for his guards and coaches, as he plea&s;ed: But it became not them to &s;end for him. It was left to his General, the Earl of <HI>Fever|&s;ham,</HI> to do what he thought be&s;t. So he went for him with his coaches and guards. And, as he came back thro' the City, he was welcomed with expre&s;&s;ions of joy by great numbers: So &s;light and un&s;table a thing is a multitude, and &s;o &s;oon al|tered. At his coming to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> he had a great Court about him. Even the Papi&s;ts crept out of their lurking holes, and ap|peared at Court with much a&s;&s;urance. The King him&s;elf began to take heart. And both at <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> and now at <HI>Whitehall,</HI> he talked in his ordinary high &s;train, ju&s;tifying all he had done: Only he &s;poke a little doubtfully of the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Magdalen</HI> College. But when he came to reflect on the &s;tate of his af|fairs, he &s;aw it was &s;o broken, that nothing was now left to deliberate upon. So he &s;ent the Earl of <HI>Fever&s;ham</HI> to <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> without demanding any pa&s;&s;port: And ordered him to de&s;ire the Prince to come to St. <HI>James</HI>'s, to con&s;ult with him of the be&s;t way for &s;ettling the Nation.</P>
<P>When the news of what had pa&s;t at <HI>London</HI> came to <HI>$span$d|&s;or,</HI> the Prince thought the Privy Council had not u&s;ed him well, who, after they had &s;ent to him to take the government upon him, had made this &s;tep without con&s;ulting him. Now
<PB N="800" REF="820">
the &s;cene was altered, and new coun&s;els were to be taken. The Prince heard the opinions, not only of tho&s;e who had come along with him, but of &s;uch of the Nobility as were now come to him, among whom the Marquis of <HI>Hallifax</HI> was one. All agreed, that it was not convenient that the King &s;hould &s;tay at <HI>Whitehall.</HI> Neither the King, nor the Prince, nor the City, could have been &s;afe, if they had been both near one another. Tumults would probably have ari&s;en out of it. The guards, and the officious flatterers, of the two Courts, would have been unquiet neighbours. It was thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tick to the point of the King's de&s;erting his people, and not to give up that, by entring upon any treaty with him. And &s;ince the Earl of <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> who had commanded the Army again&s;t the Prince, was come without a pa&s;&s;port, he was for &s;ome days put in arre&s;t.</P>
<P>It was a tender point how to di&s;po&s;e of the King's per&s;on. Some propo&s;ed rougher methods: The keeping him a pri|&s;oner, at lea&s;t till the Nation was &s;ettled, and till <HI>Ireland</HI> was &s;ecured. It was thought, his being kept in cu&s;tody, would be &s;uch a tie on all his party, as would oblige them to &s;ubmit, and be quiet. <HI>Ireland</HI> was in great danger. And his re&s;traint might oblige the Earl of <HI>Tirconnell</HI> to deliver up the govern|ment, and to di&s;arm the Papi&s;ts, which would pre&s;erve that Kingdom, and the Prote&s;tants in it. But, becau&s;e it might rai&s;e too much compa&s;&s;ion, and perhaps &s;ome di&s;order, if the King &s;hould be kept in re&s;traint within the Kingdom, therefore the &s;ending him to <HI>Breda</HI> was propo&s;ed. The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> pre&s;|&s;ed this vehemently, on the account of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tants, as the King him&s;elf told me: For tho&s;e that gave their opini|ons in this matter did it &s;ecretly, and in confidence to the Prince. The Prince &s;aid, he could not deny, but that this might be good and wi&s;e advice: But it was that to which he could not hearken: He was &s;o far &s;atisfied with the grounds of this expedition, that he could act again&s;t the King in a fair and open war: But for his per&s;on, now that he had him in his power, he could not put &s;uch a hard&s;hip on him, as to make him a pri&s;oner: And he knew the Prince&s;s's temper &s;o well, that he was &s;ure &s;he would never bear it: Nor did he know what di&s;putes it might rai&s;e, or what effect it might have upon the Parliament that was to be called: He was firmly re&s;olved never to &s;uffer any thing to be done again&s;t his per&s;on: He &s;aw it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end him out of <HI>London:</HI> And he would order a guard to attend upon him, who &s;hould only defend and protect his per&s;on, but not re&s;train him in any &s;ort.</P>
<P><PB N="801" REF="821">
A re&s;olution was taken of &s;ending the Lords <HI>Hallifax, Shrews|bury,</HI> and <HI>Delamere,</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> who were fir&s;t to order the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> guards that were about the Court to be drawn off, and &s;ent to quarters out of town: And, when that was done, the Count of <HI>Solms</HI> with the <HI>Dutch</HI> guards was to come and take all the po&s;ts about the Court. This was obeyed without any re&s;i&s;tance or di&s;order, but not without much murmuring. It was mid|night before all was &s;ettled. And then the&s;e Lords &s;ent to the Earl of <HI>Middleton,</HI> to de&s;ire him to let the King know, that they had a me&s;&s;age to deliver to him from the Prince. He went in to the King; and &s;ent them word from him, that they might come with it immediately. They came, and found him abed. They told him, the nece&s;&s;ity of affairs required, that the Prince &s;hould come pre&s;ently to <HI>London:</HI> And he thought, it would conduce to the &s;afety of the King's per&s;on, and the quiet of the town, that he &s;hould retire to &s;ome hou&s;e out of town: And they propo&s;ed <HI>Ham.</HI> The King &s;eemed much dejected; and a&s;ked, if it mu&s;t be done immediately. They told him, he might take his re&s;t fir&s;t: And they added, that he &s;hould be attended by a guard, who &s;hould only guard his per&s;on, but &s;hould give him no &s;ort of di&s;turbance. Having &s;aid this they withdrew. The Earl of <HI>Middleton</HI> came quickly after them, and a&s;ked them, if it would not do as well, if the King &s;hould go to <HI>Roche&s;ter;</HI> for &s;ince the Prince was not plea&s;ed with his coming up from <HI>Kent,</HI> it might be perhaps acceptable to him, if he &s;hould go thither again. It was very vi&s;ible, that this was propo&s;ed in order to a &s;econd e&s;cape.</P>
<P>They promi&s;ed to &s;end word immediately to the Prince of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince came to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> and the King went to <HI>Roche&s;ter.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Orange,</HI> who lay that night at <HI>Sion,</HI> within eight miles of <HI>Lon|don.</HI> He very readily con&s;ented to it. And the King went next day to <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> having ordered all that which is called the moving Wardrobe to be &s;ent before him, the Count of <HI>Solms</HI> ordering every thing to be done, as the King de&s;ired. A guard went with him that left him at full liberty, and paid him rather more re&s;pect than his own guards had done of late. Mo&s;t of that body, as it happen'd, were Papi&s;ts. So when he went to Ma&s;s, they went in, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted very reverently. And, when they were a&s;ked, how they could &s;erve in an expedition that was intended to de&s;troy their own religion, one of them an|&s;wered, his &s;oul was God's, but his &s;word was the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s. The King was &s;o much delighted with this an&s;wer, that he repeated it to all that came about him. On the &s;ame day the Prince came to St. <HI>James</HI>'s. It happen'd to be a very rainy day. And yet great numbers came to &s;ee him. But, af|ter they had &s;tood long in the wet, he di&s;appointed them:
<PB N="802" REF="822">
For he, who neither loved &s;hews nor &s;houtings, went thro' the park. And even this trifle helped to &s;et peoples &s;pirits on edge.</P>
<P>The Revolution was thus brought about, with the univer&s;al applau&s;e of the whole Nation: Only the&s;e la&s;t &s;teps began to rai&s;e a fermentation. It was &s;aid, here was an unnatural thing, to waken the King out of his &s;leep, in his own Palace, and to order him to go out of it, when he was ready to &s;ubmit to every thing. Some &s;aid, he was now a pri&s;oner, and remem|bred the &s;aying of King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t, that the pri&s;ons and the graves of Princes lay not far di&s;tant from one another: The per&s;on of the King was now &s;truck at, as well as his go|vernment: And this &s;pecious undertaking would now appear to be only a di&s;gui&s;ed and de&s;igned u&s;urpation. The&s;e things be|gan to work on great numbers. And the po&s;ting the <HI>Dutch</HI> guards, where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> guards had been, gave a general di&s;|gu&s;t to the whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army. They indeed hated the <HI>Dutch</HI> be&s;ides, on the account of the good order and &s;trict di&s;cipline they were kept under; which made them to be as much belov|ed by the Nation, as they were hated by the &s;oldiery. The Nation had never known &s;uch an inoffen&s;ive march of an Ar|my. And the peace and order of the &s;uburbs, and the free|dom of markets in and about <HI>London,</HI> was &s;o carefully main|tained, that in no time fewer di&s;orders had been committed, than were heard of this winter.</P>
<P>None of the Papi&s;ts or Jacobites were in&s;ulted in any &s;ort. The Prince had ordered me, as we came along, to take care of the Papi&s;ts, and to &s;ecure them from all violence. When he came to <HI>London,</HI> he renewed the&s;e orders, which I executed with &s;o much zeal and care, that I &s;aw all the complaints that were brought me fully redre&s;&s;ed. When we came to <HI>London</HI> I pro|cured pa&s;&s;ports for all that de&s;ired to go beyond &s;ea. Two of the Popi&s;h Bi&s;hops were put in <HI>Newgate.</HI> I went thither in the Prince's name. I told them, the Prince would not take upon him yet to give orders about pri&s;oners: As &s;oon as he did that, they &s;hould feel the effects of it. But in the mean while I ordered them to be well u&s;ed, and to be taken care of, and that their friends might be admitted to come to them. So truly did I pur&s;ue the principle of moderation, even towards tho&s;e from whom nothing of that &s;ort was to be expected.</P>
<P>Now that the Prince was come, all the bodies about the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince $span$.</NOTE> town came to welcome him. The Bi&s;hops came the next day. Only the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> tho' he had once agreed to it, yet would not come. The Clergy of <HI>London</HI> came next. The City, and a great many other bodies, came likewi&s;e, and expre&s;&s;ed a great deal of joy for the deliverance wrought for
<PB N="803" REF="823">
them by the Prince's means. Old Serjeant <HI>Maynard</HI> came with the men of the law. He was then near ninety, and yet he &s;aid the livelie&s;t thing that was heard of on that occa&s;ion. The Prince took notice of his great age, and &s;aid, that he had out|lived all the men of the law of his time: He an&s;wered, he had like to have out-lived the law it &s;elf, if his Highne&s;s had not come over.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing to be done after the compliments were over, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;ultati|ons about the &s;ettle|ment of the Nation.</NOTE> was to con&s;ider how the Nation was to be &s;ettled. The law|yers were generally of opinion, that the Prince ought to de|clare him&s;elf King, as <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh had done. This, they &s;aid, would put an end to all di&s;putes, which might other|wi&s;e grow very perplexing and tedious: And, they &s;aid, he might call a Parliament which would be a legal a&s;&s;embly, if &s;ummon|ed by the King in fact, tho' his title was not yet recognized. This was plainly contrary to his declaration, by which the &s;et|tlement of the Nation was referred to a Parliament: Such a &s;tep would make all that the Prince had hitherto done pa&s;s for an a&s;piring ambition, only to rai&s;e him&s;elf: And it would di&s;|gu&s;t tho&s;e who had been hitherto the be&s;t affected to his de|&s;igns; and make them le&s;s concerned in the quarrel, if, in&s;tead of &s;taying till the Nation &s;hould offer him the Crown, he would a&s;&s;ume it as a conque&s;t. The&s;e rea&s;ons determined the Prince again&s;t that propo&s;ition. He called all the Peers, and the members of the three la&s;t Parliaments, that were in town, together with &s;ome of the Citizens of <HI>London.</HI> When the&s;e met, it was told them, that, in the pre&s;ent di&s;traction, the Prince de&s;ired their advice about the be&s;t methods of &s;ettling the Nation. It was agreed in both the&s;e Hou&s;es, &s;uch as they were, to make an addre&s;s to the Prince, de&s;iring him to take the admini&s;tration of the go|vernment into his hands in the interim. The next propo&s;i|tion pa&s;t not &s;o unanimou&s;ly: For, it being moved that the Prince &s;hould be likewi&s;e de&s;ired to write mi&s;&s;ive letters to the &s;ame effect, and for the &s;ame per&s;ons to whom writs were i&s;&s;u|ed out for calling a Parliament, that &s;o there might be an a&s;|&s;embly of men in the form of a Parliament, tho' without writs under the Great Seal, &s;uch as that was that had called home King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd. To this the Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> objected, that &s;uch a Convention of the States could be no legal a&s;&s;em|bly, unle&s;s &s;ummoned by the King's writ. Therefore he moved, that an addre&s;s might be made to the King, to order the writs to be i&s;&s;ued out. Few were of his mind. The matter was car|ried the other way: And orders were given for tho&s;e letters to be &s;ent round the Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="804" REF="824">
The King continued a week at <HI>Roche&s;ter.</HI> And both he him|&s;elf, and every body el&s;e, &s;aw that he was at full liberty, and that the guard about him put him under no &s;ort of re&s;traint. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King went over into <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> Many that were zealous for his intere&s;ts went to him, and pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;tay, and to &s;ee the i&s;&s;ue of things: A party would appear for him: Good terms would be got for him: And things would be brought to a rea&s;onable agreement. He was much di&s;tracted between his own inclinations, and the impor|tunities of his friends. The Queen, hearing what had hap|pen'd, writ a mo&s;t vehement letter to him, pre&s;&s;ing his coming over, remembring him of his promi&s;e, which &s;he charged on him in a very earne&s;t, if not in an imperious &s;train. This let|ter was intercepted. I had an account of it from one that read it. The Prince ordered it to be conveyed to the King. And that determined him. So he gave &s;ecret orders to pre|pare a ve&s;&s;el for him; and drew a paper, which he left on his table, reproaching the Nation for their for&s;aking him. He de|clared, that tho' he was going to &s;eek for foreign aid to re|&s;tore him to his Throne, yet he would not make u&s;e of it to overthrow either the religion e&s;tabli&s;hed, or the laws of the land. And &s;o he left <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> very &s;ecretly, on the la&s;t day of this memorable year, and got &s;afe over to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But, before I enter into the next year, I will give &s;ome ac|count <NOTE PLACE="marg">The affairs of <HI>Scotland.</HI></NOTE> of the affairs of <HI>Scotland.</HI> There was no force left there, but a very &s;mall one, &s;carce able to defend the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Eden|burgh,</HI> of which the Duke of <HI>Gordon</HI> was Governor. He was a Papi&s;t; but had neither the &s;pirit, nor the courage, which &s;uch a po&s;t required at that time. As &s;oon as the news came to <HI>Scot|land</HI> of the King's de&s;ertion, the rabble got together there, as they had done in <HI>London.</HI> They broke into all Popi&s;h Chapels, and into the Church of Holy Rood Hou&s;e, which had been adorned at a great charge to be a Royal Chapel, particularly for the order of St. <HI>Andrew</HI> and the <HI>Thi&s;tle,</HI> which the King had re&s;olved to &s;et up in <HI>Scotland</HI> in imitation of the order of the Garter in <HI>England.</HI> They defaced it quite, and &s;eized on &s;ome that were thought great delinquents, in particular on the Earl of <HI>Perth,</HI> who had di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf, and had got aboard a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el: But he was &s;eized on, and put in pri|&s;on. The whole Kingdom, except only the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> declared for the Prince, and received his declaration for that Kingdom with great joy. This was done in the North very unanimou&s;ly, by the Epi&s;copal, as well as by the Pre&s;byterian party. But in the We&s;tern Counties, the Pre&s;byterians, who had &s;uffered much in a cour&s;e of many years, thought that the time was now come, not only to procure them&s;elves ea&s;e
<PB N="805" REF="825">
and liberty, but to revenge them&s;elves upon others. They ge|nerally broke in upon the Epi&s;copal Clergy with great in&s;o|lence and much cruelty. They carried them about the pari&s;hes in a mock proce&s;&s;ion: They tore their growns, and drove them from their Churches and hou&s;es. Nor did they treat tho&s;e of them, who had appeared very zealou&s;ly again&s;t Popery, with any di&s;tinction. The Bi&s;hops of that Kingdom had writ a very in|decent letter to the King, upon the news of the Prince's being blown back by the &s;torm, full of injurious expre&s;&s;ions towards the Prince, expre&s;&s;ing their abhorrence of his de&s;ign: And, in con|clu&s;ion, they wi&s;hed that the King might have the necks of his enemies. This was &s;ent up as a pattern to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bi|&s;hops, and was printed in the <HI>Gazette.</HI> But they did not think fit to copy after it in <HI>England.</HI> The Epi&s;copal party in <HI>Scot|land</HI> &s;aw them&s;elves under a great cloud: So they re&s;olved all to adhere to the Earl of <HI>Dundee,</HI> who had &s;erved &s;ome years in <HI>Holland,</HI> and was both an able Officer, and a man of good parts, and of &s;ome very valuable vertues: But, as he was proud and ambitious, &s;o he had taken up a mo&s;t violent hatred of the whole Pre&s;byterian party, and had executed all the &s;evere&s;t orders again&s;t them with great rigour; even to the &s;hooting many on the highway, that refu&s;ed the oath required of them. The Pre&s;byterians looked on him, as their mo&s;t implacable enemy: And the Epi&s;copal party tru&s;ted mo&s;t entirely to him. Upon the Prince's coming to <HI>London,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Hamilton</HI> called a meeting of all the men of Quality of the <HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Nation then in town: And the&s;e made an addre&s;s to the Prince with rela|tion to <HI>Scotland,</HI> almo&s;t in the &s;ame terms in which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> addre&s;s was conceived. And now the admini&s;tration of the go|vernment of the whole i&s;le of <HI>Britain</HI> was put in the Prince's hands.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect from <HI>Ireland</HI> was more dreadful. <HI>Tyrconnell</HI> gave <NOTE PLACE="marg">The affairs of <HI>Ireland.</HI></NOTE> out new commi&s;&s;ions for levying thirty thou&s;and men. And re|ports were &s;pread about that I&s;land, that a general ma&s;&s;acre of the Prote&s;tants was fixed to be in <HI>November.</HI> Upon which the Pro|te&s;tants began to run together for their common defence, both in <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> and in <HI>Ul&s;ter.</HI> They had no great &s;trength in <HI>Mun&s;ter.</HI> They had been di&s;armed, and had no &s;tore of ammunition for the few aims that were left them. So they de&s;paired of being able to defend them&s;elves, and came over to <HI>England</HI> in great numbers, and full of di&s;mal apprehen&s;ions for tho&s;e they had left behind them. They moved earne&s;tly, that a &s;peedy a&s;&s;i&s;|tance might be &s;ent to them. In <HI>Ul&s;ter</HI> the Prote&s;tants had more &s;trength: But they wanted a head. The Lords of <HI>Gre|nard</HI> and <HI>Mountjoy,</HI> who were the chief military men among
<PB N="806" REF="826">
them, in whom they confided mo&s;t, kept &s;till &s;uch mea&s;ures with <HI>Tyrconnell,</HI> that they would not take the conduct of them. Two towns, that had both very little defence about them, and a very &s;mall &s;tore of provi&s;ions within them, were by the ra&s;h|ne&s;s or boldne&s;s of &s;ome brave young men &s;ecured: So that they refu&s;ed to receive a Popi&s;h garri&s;on, or to &s;ubmit to <HI>Tyrcon|nell</HI>'s orders. The&s;e were <HI>London-Derry,</HI> and <HI>Ini&s;killing.</HI> Both of them were advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated. <HI>Tyrconnell</HI> &s;ent troops into the North to reduce the country. Upon which great numbers fled into tho&s;e places, and brought in provi&s;ions to them. And &s;o they re&s;olved to defend them&s;elves, with a firmne&s;s of courage that cannot be enough admired: For when they were aban|doned, both by the Gentry and the military men, tho&s;e two &s;mall unfurni&s;hed and unfortified places, re&s;olved to &s;tand to their own defence, and at all perils to &s;tay till &s;upplies &s;hould come to them from <HI>England.</HI> I will not enlarge more upon the affairs of that Kingdom; both becau&s;e I had no occa&s;ion to be well informed about them, and becau&s;e Dr. <HI>King,</HI> now Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Dublin,</HI> wrote a copious hi&s;tory of the govern|ment of <HI>Ireland</HI> during this reign, which is &s;o well received, and &s;o univer&s;ally acknowledged to be as truly as it is finely written, that I refer my reader to the account of tho&s;e matters, which is fully and faithfully given by that learned and zealous Prelate.</P>
<P>And now I enter upon the year 1689. In which the two <NOTE PLACE="marg">1689</NOTE> fir&s;t things to be con&s;idered, before the Convention could be brought together, were, the &s;ettling the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army, and the affairs of <HI>Ireland.</HI> As for the Army, &s;ome of the bodies, tho&s;e chiefly that were full of Papi&s;ts, and of men ill affected, were to be broken. And, in order to that, a loan was &s;et on foot in the City, for rai&s;ing the money that was to pay their arrears at their di&s;banding, and for carrying on the pay of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Armies till the Convention &s;hould meet, and &s;ettle the Nation. This was the great di&s;tinction of tho&s;e who were well affected to the Prince: For, whereas tho&s;e who were ill affected to him refu&s;ed to join in the loan, pretending there was no certainty of their being repayed; the others did not doubt but the Convention would pay all that was advanced in &s;o great an exigence, and &s;o they &s;ub&s;cribed liberally, as the occa&s;ion required.</P>
<P>As for the affairs of <HI>Ireland,</HI> there was a great variety of opi|nions among them. Some thought, that <HI>Ireland</HI> would certain|ly follow the fate of <HI>England.</HI> This was managed by an arti|fice of <HI>Tyrconnell</HI>'s, who, what by deceiving, what by threat|ning the eminente&s;t Prote&s;tants in <HI>Dublin,</HI> got them to write
<PB N="807" REF="827">
over to <HI>London,</HI> and give a&s;&s;urances that he would deliver up <HI>Ireland,</HI> if he might have good terms for him&s;elf, and for the <HI>Iri&s;h.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> was much depended on by the Prote&s;tants of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who made all their applications to the Prince by him. Tho&s;e, who were employed by <HI>Tyrconnell</HI> to deceive the Prince, made their applications by Sir <HI>William Tem|ple,</HI> who had a long and well e&s;tabli&s;hed credit with him. They &s;aid, <HI>Tyrconnell</HI> would never lay down the government of <HI>Ireland,</HI> unle&s;s he was &s;ure that the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> was not to &s;ucceed: He knew his peevi&s;hne&s;s and &s;pite, and that he would take &s;evere revenges for what he thought had been done to him&s;elf, if he had them in his power: And there|fore he would not treat, till he was a&s;&s;ured of that. Upon this the Prince did avoid the &s;peaking to the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> of tho&s;e matters. And then he, who had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in his expectation of that po&s;t, &s;eeing the Prince thus &s;hut him out of the hopes of it, became a mo&s;t violent oppo&s;er of the new &s;ettlement. He reconciled him&s;elf to King <HI>James:</HI> And has been ever &s;ince one of the hotte&s;t promoters of his intere&s;t of any in the Nation. <HI>Temple</HI> entred into a management with <HI>Tyrconnell</HI>'s agents, who, it is very probable, if things had not taken a great turn in <HI>England,</HI> would have come to a compo|&s;ition. Others thought, that the leaving <HI>Ireland</HI> in that dan|gerous &s;tate, might be a mean to bring the Convention to a more &s;peedy &s;ettlement of <HI>England;</HI> and that therefore the Prince ought not to make too much ha&s;te to relieve <HI>Ireland.</HI> This advice was generally believed to be given by the Marquis of <HI>Hallifax:</HI> And it was like him. The Prince did not &s;eem to apprehend enough the con&s;equences of the revolt of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and was much blamed for his &s;lowne&s;s in not preventing it in time.</P>
<P>The truth was, he did not know whom to tru&s;t. A gene|ral <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince in treaty with the $word$ of $span$ $word$.</NOTE> di&s;content, next to mutiny, began to &s;pread it &s;elf thro' the whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army. The turn, that they were now mak|ing from him, was almo&s;t as quick as that which they had made to him. He could not tru&s;t them. Probably, if he had &s;ent any of them over, they would have joined with <HI>Tyrcon|nell.</HI> Nor could he well &s;end over any of his <HI>Dutch</HI> troops. It was to them that he chiefly tru&s;ted, for maintaining the quiet of <HI>England.</HI> Probably the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army would have become more in&s;olent, if the <HI>Dutch</HI> force had been con&s;iderably dimi|ni&s;hed. And the King's magazins were &s;o exhau&s;ted, that till new &s;tores were provided, there was very little ammunition to &s;pare. The rai&s;ing new troops was a work of time. There was no &s;hip of war in tho&s;e &s;eas, to &s;ecure the tran&s;port. And
<PB N="808" REF="828">
to &s;end a &s;mall company of Officers with &s;ome ammunition, which was all that could be done on the &s;udden, &s;eemed to be an ex|po&s;ing them to the enemy. The&s;e con&s;iderations made him more ea&s;y to entertain a propo&s;ition that was made to him, as was believed, by the <HI>Temples;</HI> (for Sir <HI>William</HI> had both a brother and a &s;on that made then a con&s;iderable figure;) which was, to &s;end over Lieutenant General <HI>Hamilton,</HI> one of the Officers that belonged to <HI>Ireland.</HI> He was a Papi&s;t, but was believed to be a man of honour: And he had certainly great credit with the Earl of <HI>Tyrconnell.</HI> He had &s;erved in <HI>France</HI> with great re|putation, and had a great intere&s;t in all the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and was now in the Prince's hands; and had been together with a body of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> &s;oldiers, whom the Prince kept for &s;ome time as pri&s;oners in the i&s;le of <HI>Wight;</HI> whom he gave afterwards to the Em|peror, tho', as they pa&s;&s;ed thro' <HI>Germany,</HI> they de&s;erted in great numbers, and got into <HI>France. Hamilton</HI> was a &s;ort of pri&s;oner of war. So he undertook to go over to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and to pre|vail with the Earl of <HI>Tyrconnell</HI> to deliver up the government; and promi&s;ed, that he would either bring him to it, or that he would come back, and give an account of his negotiation. This &s;tep had a very ill effect: For before <HI>Hamilton</HI> came to <HI>Dublin,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Tyrconnell</HI> was in &s;uch de&s;pair, looking on all as lo&s;t, that he &s;eemed to be very near a full re&s;olution of entring on a treaty, to get the be&s;t terms that he could. But <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s coming changed him quite. He repre&s;ented to him, that things were turning fa&s;t in <HI>England</HI> in favour of the King: So that, if he &s;tood firm, all would come round again. He &s;aw, that he mu&s;t &s;tudy to manage this &s;o dextrou&s;ly, as to gain as much time as he could, that &s;o the Prince might not make too much ha&s;te, before a Fleet and &s;upplies might come from <HI>France.</HI> So &s;everal letters were writ over by the &s;ame management, giv|ing a&s;&s;urances that the Earl of <HI>Tyrconnell</HI> was fully re&s;olved to treat and &s;ubmit. And, to carry this further, two Commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;ent from the Council-board to <HI>France.</HI> The one was a zealous Prote&s;tant, the other was a Papi&s;t. Their in&s;tructions were, to repre&s;ent to the King the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Ireland</HI>'s &s;ubmit|ting to <HI>England.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Tyrconnell</HI> pretended, that in honour he could do no le&s;s than di&s;engage him&s;elf to his ma&s;|ter, before he laid down the government. Yet he &s;eemed re|&s;olved not to &s;tay for an an&s;wer, or a con&s;ent; but, that, as &s;oon as this me&s;&s;age was delivered, he would &s;ubmit upon good conditions: And for the&s;e, he knew, he would have all that he a&s;ked. With this management he gained his point, which was much time. And he now fancied, that the honour of re&s;toring the King would belong chiefly to him&s;elf. Thus <HI>Hamilton,</HI>
<PB N="809" REF="829">
by breaking his own faith, &s;ecured the Earl of <HI>Tyrconnell</HI> to the King: And this gave the beginning to the war of <HI>Ireland. Mountjoy,</HI> the Prote&s;tant Lord that was &s;ent to <HI>France,</HI> in&s;tead of being heard to deliver his me&s;&s;age, was clapt up in the <HI>Ba&s;tille;</HI> which, &s;ince he was &s;ent in the name of a Kingdom, was thought a very di&s;honourable thing, and contrary to the law of Nations. Tho&s;e who had advi&s;ed the &s;ending over <HI>Ha|milton</HI> were now much out of countenance: And the Earl of <HI>Clarendon</HI> was a loud declaimer again&s;t it. It was believed, that it had a terrible effect on Sir <HI>William Temple</HI>'s &s;on, who had rai&s;ed in the Prince a high opinion of <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s honour. Soon after that, he, who had no other vi&s;ible cau&s;e of melan|choly, be&s;ides this, went in a boat on the <HI>Thames,</HI> near the Bridge, where the river runs mo&s;t impetuou&s;ly, and leaped in|to the river, and was drowned.</P>
<P>The &s;itting of the Convention was now very near. And all <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Con|vention met</NOTE> men were forming their &s;chemes, and fortifying their party all they could. The elections were managed fairly all <HI>England</HI> over. The Prince did in no &s;ort interpo&s;e in any recommendation, directly or indirectly. Three parties were formed about the town. The one was for calling back the King, and treating with him for &s;uch &s;ecurities to religion and the laws, as might put them out of the danger for the future of a Di&s;pen&s;ing or Ar|bitrary Power. The&s;e were all of the high Church party, who had carried the point of Submi&s;&s;ion and Non-re&s;i&s;tance &s;o far, that they thought nothing le&s;s than this could con&s;i&s;t with their duty and their oaths. When it was objected to them, that, according to tho&s;e notions that they had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with, they ought to be for calling the King back without con|ditions: When he came, they might indeed offer him their pe|titions, which he might grant or reject as he plea&s;ed: But that the offering him conditions, before he was recalled, was con|trary to their former doctrine of unconditioned allegiance. They were at &s;uch a &s;tand upon this objection, that it was plain, they &s;poke of conditions, either in compliance with the hu|mour of the Nation; or that, with relation to their particular intere&s;t, nature was &s;o &s;trong in them, that it was too hard for their doctrine.</P>
<P>When this notion was to&s;&s;ed and talked of about the town, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some are for a Prince Re|gent</NOTE> &s;o few went into it, that the party which &s;upported it went over to the &s;cheme of a &s;econd party; which was, that King <HI>James</HI> had by his ill admini&s;tration of the government brought him&s;elf into an incapacity of holding the exerci&s;e of the &s;overeign authority any more in his own hand: But, as in the ca&s;e of lunaticks, the right &s;till remained in him: Only the guardian|&s;hip,
<PB N="810" REF="830">
or the exerci&s;e, of it was to be lodged with a Prince Re|gent: So that the right of &s;overeignty &s;hould be owned to re|main &s;till in the King, and that the exerci&s;e of it &s;hould be ve&s;ted in the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> as Prince Regent. A third par|ty was for &s;etting King <HI>James</HI> quite a&s;ide, and for &s;etting the Prince on the Throne.</P>
<P>When the Convention was opened on the twenty fourth of <HI>January,</HI> the Archbi&s;hop came not to take his place among them. He re&s;olved neither to act for nor again&s;t the King's intere&s;t; which, con&s;idering his high po&s;t, was thought very unbecom|ing. For if he thought, as by his behaviour afterwards it &s;eems he did, that the Nation was running into trea&s;on, rebellion, and perjury, it was a &s;trange thing to &s;ee one, who was at the head of the Church, &s;it &s;ilent all the while that this was in de|bate; and not once &s;o much as declare his opinion by &s;peak|ing, voting, or prote&s;ting, not to mention the other Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical methods that certainly became his character. But he was a poor &s;pirited, and fearful man; and acted a very mean part in all this great tran&s;action. The Bi&s;hop's Bench was very full, as were al&s;o the Benches of the Temporal Lords. The Earls of <HI>Nottingham, Clarendon,</HI> and <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> were the men that managed the debates in favour of a Regent, in oppo&s;iti|on to tho&s;e who were for &s;etting up another King.</P>
<P>They thought, this would &s;ave the Nation, and yet &s;ecure the honour of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the &s;acredne&s;s of the Crown. It was urged, that if, upon any pretence what&s;oever, the Nation might throw off their King, then the Crown mu&s;t become precarious, and the power of judging the King mu&s;t be in the people. This mu&s;t end in a Commonwealth. A great deal was brought from both the laws and hi&s;tory of <HI>England,</HI> to prove, that not only the per&s;on, but the authority of the King was &s;acred. The law had indeed provided a remedy of a Regency for the infancy of our Kings. So, if a King &s;hould fall into &s;uch errors in his conduct, as &s;hewed that he was as little capable of holding the government as an infant was, then the E&s;tates of the Kingdom might, upon this parity of the ca&s;e, &s;eek to the remedy provided for an infant, and lodge the power with a Regent. But the right was to remain, and to go on in a lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: For, if that was once put ever &s;o little out of its order, the Crown would in a little time become elective; which might rend the Nation in pieces by a diver&s;ity of electi|ons, and by the different factions that would adhere to the per|&s;on whom they had elected. They did not deny, but that great objections lay again&s;t the methods that they propo&s;ed. But affairs were brought into &s;o de&s;perate a &s;tate by King <HI>James</HI>'s
<PB N="811" REF="831">
conduct, that it was not po&s;&s;ible to propo&s;e a remedy, that might not be ju&s;tly excepted to. But they thought, their ex|pedient would take in the greate&s;t, as well as the be&s;t, part of the Nation: Whereas all other expedients gratified a Republican party, compo&s;ed of the Di&s;&s;enters, and of men of no religion, who hoped now to &s;ee the Church ruined, and the govern|ment &s;et upon &s;uch a bottom, as that we &s;hould have only a titular King; who, as he had his power from the people, &s;o &s;hould be accountable to them for the exerci&s;e of it, and &s;hould forfeit it at their plea&s;ure. The much greater part of the Hou&s;e of Lords was for this, and &s;tuck long to it: And &s;o was about a third part of the Hou&s;e of Commons. The great|e&s;t part of the Clergy declared them&s;elves for it.</P>
<P>But of tho&s;e who agreed in this expedient, it was vi&s;ible there were two different parties. Some intended to bring King <HI>James</HI> back; and went into this, as the mo&s;t probable way for laying the Nation a&s;leep, and for overcoming the pre&s;ent aver|&s;ion that all people had to him. That being once done, they reckoned it would be no hard thing, with the help of &s;ome time, to compa&s;s the other. Others &s;eemed to mean more &s;in|cerely. They &s;aid, they could not vote or argue but accord|ing to their own principles, as long as the matter was yet en|tire: But they owned that they had taken up another princi|ple, both from the law and from the hi&s;tory of <HI>England;</HI> which was, that they would obey and pay allegiance to the King for the time being: They thought a King thus <HI>de facto</HI> had a right to their obedience, and that they were bound to adhere to him, and to defend him, even in oppo&s;ition to him with whom they thought the right did &s;till remain. The Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI> was the per&s;on that owned this doctrine the mo&s;t dur|ing the&s;e debates. He &s;aid to my &s;elf, that tho' he could not argue nor vote, but according to the &s;cheme and principles he had, concerning our laws and con&s;titution, yet he &s;hould not be &s;orry to &s;ee his &s;ide out voted; and that, tho' he could not agree to the making a King as things &s;tood, yet if he found one made, he would be more faithful to him, than tho&s;e that made him could be according to their own principles.</P>
<P>The third party was made up of tho&s;e, who thought that there <NOTE PLACE="marg">Others are $word$ another King.</NOTE> was an original contract between the Kings and the people of <HI>England;</HI> by which the Kings were bound to defend their peo|ple, and to govern them according to law, in lieu of which the people were bound to obey and &s;erve the King. The proof of this appeared in the ancient forms of Coronations &s;till ob|&s;erved: By which the people were a&s;ked, if they would have that per&s;on before them to be their King: And, upon their &s;houts
<PB N="812" REF="832">
of con&s;ent, the Coronation was gone about. But, before the King was crowned, he was a&s;ked, if he would not defend and protect his people, and govern them according to law: And, upon his promi&s;ing and &s;wearing this, he was crowned: And then homage was done him. And, tho' of late the Corona|tion has been con&s;idered rather as a &s;olemn in&s;talment, than that which gave the King his authority, &s;o that it was become a maxim in law that the King never died, and that the new King was crowned in the right of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, yet the&s;e forms, that were &s;till continued, &s;hewed what the government was originally. Many things were brought to &s;upport this from the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Saxon</HI> times. It was urged, that <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror was received upon his promi&s;ing to keep the laws of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confe&s;&s;or, which was plainly the original con|tract between him and the Nation. This was often renewed by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, and <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, were depo&s;ed for breaking the&s;e laws: And the&s;e depo&s;itions were &s;till good in law, &s;ince they were not rever&s;ed, nor was the right of depo&s;ing them ever renounced or di&s;owned. Ma|ny things were alledged, from what had pa&s;t during the Barons wars, for confirming all this. Upon which I will add one par|ticular circum&s;tance, that the original of King <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> with his Great Seal to it, was then given to me by a Gentleman that found it among his Father's papers, but did not know how he came by it: And it is &s;till in my hands. It was &s;aid in this argument, what did all the limitations of the Regal Power &s;ignify, if upon a King's breaking thro' them all, the people had not a right to maintain their laws, and to pre&s;erve their con&s;titution? It was indeed confe&s;&s;ed, that this might have ill con&s;equences, and might be carried too far. But the denying this right in any ca&s;e what&s;oever, did plainly de|&s;troy all liberty, and e&s;tabli&s;h tyranny. The pre&s;ent alteration propo&s;ed would be no precedent, but to the like ca&s;e. And it was fit that a precedent &s;hould be made for &s;uch occa&s;ions; if tho&s;e of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, and <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, were not acknowledged to be good ones. It was &s;aid, that, if King <HI>James</HI> had only broken &s;ome laws, and done &s;ome illegal acts, it might be ju&s;tly urged, that it was not rea&s;onable on account of the&s;e to carry &s;everities too far. But he had broken thro' the laws in many publick and avowed in&s;tances: He had &s;et up an open treaty with <HI>Rome:</HI> He had &s;haken the whole &s;ettlement of <HI>Ire|land;</HI> and had put that I&s;land, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and Prote&s;tants that were there, in the power of the <HI>Iri&s;h:</HI> The Di&s;pen&s;ing Power took away not only tho&s;e laws to which it was applied, but all other laws what&s;oever by the precedent it had &s;et, and
<PB N="813" REF="833">
by the con&s;equences that followed upon it: By the Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Commi&s;&s;ion he had invaded the liberty of the Church, and &s;ubjected the Clergy to meer will and plea&s;ure: And all was concluded by his de&s;erting his people, and flying to a foreign power, rather than &s;tay and &s;ubmit to the determinations of a free Parliament. Upon all which it was inferred, that he had abdicated the government, and had left the Throne vacant: Which therefore ought now to be filled, that &s;o the Nation might be pre&s;erved, and the Regal government continued in it.</P>
<P>As to the propo&s;ition for a Prince Regent, it was argued, <NOTE PLACE="marg">And again&s;t a Regency.</NOTE> that this was as much again&s;t Monarchy, or rather more, than what they moved for. If a King's ill government did give the people a right in any ca&s;e to take his power from him, and to lodge it with another, owning that the right to it remained &s;till with him, this might have every whit as bad con&s;equences, as the other &s;eemed to have: For recour&s;e might be had to this violent remedy too often, and too ra&s;hly. By this propo&s;ition of a Regent, here were to be upon the matter two Kings at the &s;ame time: One with the title, and another with the power of a King. This was both more illegal, and more un&s;afe, than the method they propo&s;ed. The law of <HI>England</HI> had &s;ettled the point of the &s;ubjects &s;ecurity in obey|ing the King in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in the &s;tatute made by <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh. So every man knew he was &s;afe under a King, and &s;o would act with zeal and courage. But all &s;uch as &s;hould act under a Prince Regent, created by this Convention, were upon a bottom that had not the nece&s;&s;ary forms of law for it. All that was done by them would be thought null and void in law: So that no man could be &s;afe that acted under it. If the oaths to King <HI>James</HI> were thought to be &s;till binding, the &s;ubjects were by the&s;e not only bound to maintain his title to the Crown, but all his prerogatives and powers. And therefore it &s;eemed ab&s;urd to continue a government in his name, and to take oaths &s;till to him, when yet all the power was taken out of his hands. This would be an odious thing, both before God and the whole world, and would ca&s;t a reproach on us at pre|&s;ent, and bring certain ruin for the future on any &s;uch mixed and unnatural &s;ort of government. Therefore, if the oaths were &s;till binding, the Nation was &s;till bound by them, not by halves, but in their whole extent. It was &s;aid, that, if the government &s;hould be carried on in King <HI>James</HI>'s name, but in other hands, the body of the Nation would con&s;ider him as the per&s;on that was truly their King. And if any &s;hould plot
<PB N="814" REF="834">
or act for him, they could not be proceeded again&s;t for high trea&s;on, as con&s;piring again&s;t the King's per&s;on or govern|ment; when it would be vi&s;ible, that they were only de&s;ign|ing to pre&s;erve his per&s;on, and to re&s;tore him to his govern|ment. To proceed again&s;t any, or to take their lives for &s;uch practices, would be to add murder to perjury. And it was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that Juries would find &s;uch men guilty of trea|&s;on. In the weakne&s;s of infancy, a Prince Regent was in law the &s;ame per&s;on with the King, who had not yet a will: And it was to be pre&s;umed, the Prince Regent's will was the King's will. But that could not be applied to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; where the King and the Regent mu&s;t be pre&s;umed to be in a perpetual &s;truggle, the one to recover his power, the other to pre&s;erve his authority. The&s;e things &s;eemed to be &s;o plainly made out in the debate, that it was generally thought that no man could re&s;i&s;t &s;uch force of argument, but tho&s;e who intend|ed to bring back King <HI>James.</HI> And it was believed, that tho&s;e of his party, who were looked on as men of con&s;cience, had &s;ecret orders from him to act upon this pretence; &s;ince other|wi&s;e they offered to act clearly in contradiction to their own oaths and principles.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e who were for continuing the government, and on|ly for changing the per&s;ons, were not at all of a mind. Some among them had very different views and ends from the re&s;t. The&s;e intended to take advantage from the pre&s;ent conjuncture, to depre&s;s the Crown, to render it as much precarious and elective as they could, and to rai&s;e the power of the people upon the ruine of Monarchy. Among tho&s;e &s;ome went &s;o far as to &s;ay, that the whole government was di&s;&s;olved. But this appeared a bold and dangerous a&s;&s;ertion: For that might have been carried &s;o far, as to infer from it, that all men's proper|ties, honours, rights, and franchi&s;es, were di&s;&s;olved. There|fore it was thought &s;afer to &s;ay, that King <HI>James</HI> had di&s;|&s;olved the tie that was between him and the Nation. Others avoided going into new &s;peculations, or &s;chemes of govern|ment. They thought it was enough to &s;ay, that in extream ca&s;es all obligations did cea&s;e; and that in our pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances the extremity of affairs, by rea&s;on of the late ill govern|ment, and by King <HI>James</HI>'s flying over to the enemy of the Nation, rather than &s;ubmit to rea&s;onable terms, had put the people of <HI>England</HI> on the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ecuring them&s;elves upon a legal bottom. It was &s;aid, that tho' the vow of marriage was made for term of life, and without conditions expre&s;&s;ed, yet a breach in the tie it &s;elf &s;ets the innocent party at liber|ty.
<PB N="815" REF="835">
So a King, who had his power both given him and de|fined by the law, and was bound to govern by law, when he &s;et him&s;elf to break all laws, and in conclu&s;ion de&s;erted his peo|ple, did, by &s;o doing, &s;et them at liberty to put them&s;elves in a legal and &s;afe &s;tate. There was no need of fearing ill con|&s;equences from this. Hou&s;es were pulled down or blown up in a fire: And yet men found them&s;elves &s;afe in their hou&s;es. In extream dangers the common &s;en&s;e of mankind would ju&s;ti|fy extream remedies; tho' there was no &s;pecial provi&s;ion that directed to them, or allowed of them. Therefore, they &s;aid, a Nation's &s;ecuring it &s;elf again&s;t a King, who was &s;ubverting the government, did not expo&s;e Monarchy, nor rai&s;e a popular authority, as &s;ome did tragically repre&s;ent the matter.</P>
<P>There were al&s;o great di&s;putes about the original contract: Some denying there was any &s;uch thing, and a&s;king where it was kept, and how it could be come at. To this others an|&s;wered, that it was implied in a legal government: Tho' in a long tract of time, and in dark ages, there was not &s;uch an explicit proof of it to be found. Yet many hints from law|books and hi&s;tories were brought to &s;hew, that the Nation had always &s;ubmitted, and obeyed in con&s;ideration of their laws, which were &s;till &s;tipulated to them.</P>
<P>There were al&s;o many debates on the word <HI>abdicate:</HI> For the Commons came &s;oon to a re&s;olution, that King <HI>James,</HI> by breaking the original contract, and by withdrawing him&s;elf, had abdicated the government; and that the Throne was thereby become vacant. They &s;ent this vote to the Lords, and pray|ed their concurrence. Upon which many debates and confer|ences aro&s;e. At la&s;t it came to a free conference, in which, according to the &s;en&s;e of the whole Nation, the Commons had clearly the advantage on their &s;ide. The Lords had &s;ome more colour for oppo&s;ing the word <HI>abdicate,</HI> &s;ince that was of|ten taken in a &s;en&s;e that imported the full purpo&s;e and con|&s;ent of him that abdicated; which could not be pretended in this ca&s;e. But there were good authorities brought, by which it appeared, that when a per&s;on did a thing upon which his leaving any office ought to follow, he was &s;aid to abdicate. But this was a critical di&s;pute: And it &s;carce became the great|ne&s;s of that a&s;&s;embly, or the importance of the matter.</P>
<P>It was a more important debate, whether, &s;uppo&s;ing King <HI>James</HI> had abdicated, the Throne could be declared vacant. It was urged, that, by the law, the King did never die; but that with the la&s;t breath of the dying King the Regal authority went to the next heir. So it was &s;aid, that, &s;uppo&s;ing King <HI>James</HI>
<PB N="816" REF="836">
had abdicated, the Throne was <HI>(ip&s;o facto)</HI> filled in that in&s;tant by the next heir. This &s;eemed to be proved by the heirs of the King being &s;worn to in the oath of allegiance; which oath was not only made per&s;onally to the King, but likewi&s;e to his heirs and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Tho&s;e who in&s;i&s;ted on the Abdication &s;aid, that, if the King di&s;&s;olved the tie between him and his &s;ubjects to him&s;elf, he di&s;&s;olved their tie likewi&s;e to his po&s;terity. An heir was one that came in the room of a per&s;on that was dead; it being a maxim that no man can be the heir of a living man. If therefore the King had fallen from his own right, as no heir of his could pretend to any inheritance from him, as long as he was alive, &s;o they could &s;ucceed to nothing, but to that which was ve&s;ted in him at the time of his death. And, as in the ca&s;e of attainder every right that a man was dive&s;ted of before his death was, as it were, annihilated in him; and by con&s;equence could not pa&s;s to his heirs by his death, not being then in him&s;elf: So, if a King did &s;et his people free from any tie to him&s;elf, they mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be put in a &s;tate, in which they might &s;ecure them&s;elves; and therefore could not be bound to receive one, who they had rea&s;on to believe would &s;tudy to di&s;&s;olve and revenge all they had done. If the prin|ciple of &s;elf pre&s;ervation did ju&s;tify a Nation in &s;ecuring it &s;elf from a violent inva&s;ion, and a total &s;ubver&s;ion, then it mu&s;t have its full &s;cope, to give a real, and not a &s;eeming and fraudulent, &s;ecurity. They did acknowledge, that upon the grounds of natural equity, and for &s;ecuring the Nation in after times, it was fit to go as near the lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as might be: Yet they could not yield that point, that they were &s;trict|ly bound to it.</P>
<P>It was propo&s;ed, that the birth of the pretended Prince might <NOTE PLACE="marg">$para$</NOTE> be examined into. Some pre&s;&s;ed this, not &s;o much from an opinion that they were bound to a&s;&s;ert his right, if it &s;hould appear that he was born of the Queen, as becau&s;e they thought it would ju&s;tify the Nation, and more particularly the Prince and the two Prince&s;&s;es, if an impo&s;ture in that matter could have been proved. And it would have gone far to &s;atisfy ma|ny of the weaker &s;ort, as to all the proceeding again&s;t King <HI>James.</HI> Upon which I was ordered to gather together all the pre&s;umptive proofs that were formerly mentioned, which were all ready to have been made out. It is true, the&s;e did not amount to a full and legal proof: Yet they &s;eemed to be &s;uch violent pre&s;umptions, that, when they were all laid together, they were more convincing than plain and downright evi|dence: For that was liable to the &s;u&s;picion of &s;ubornation:
<PB N="817" REF="837">
Whereas the other &s;eemed to carry on them very convincing characters of truth and certainty. But, when this matter was in private debated, &s;ome ob&s;erved, that, as King <HI>James</HI> by go|ing about to prove the truth of the birth, and yet doing it &s;o de|fectively, had really made it more &s;u&s;picious than it was before; &s;o, if there was no clear and po&s;itive proof made of an im|po&s;ture, the pretending to examine into it, and then the not being able to make it out beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of contra|diction, would really give more credit to the thing, than it then had, and, in&s;tead of weakning it, would &s;trengthen the preten&s;ion of his birth.</P>
<P>When this debate was propo&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Lords, it <NOTE PLACE="marg">But it was rejected</NOTE> was rejected with indignation. He was now &s;ent out of <HI>Eng|land</HI> to be bred up in <HI>France,</HI> an enemy both to the Nation, and to the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion: It was impo&s;&s;ible for the peo|ple of <HI>England</HI> to know, whether he was the &s;ame per&s;on that had been carried over, or not: If he &s;hould die, another might be put in his room, in &s;uch a manner that the Nation could not be a&s;&s;ured concerning him: The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation ought not to &s;end into another country for witne&s;&s;es to prove that he was their Prince; much le&s;s receive one upon the te&s;timony of &s;uch, as were not only aliens, but ought to be pre&s;umed ene|mies: It was al&s;o known, that all the per&s;ons, who had been the confidents in that matter, were conveyed away: So it was impo&s;&s;ible to come at them, by who&s;e means only the truth of that birth could be found out. But while the&s;e things were fairly debated by &s;ome, there were others who had deeper and darker de&s;igns in this matter.</P>
<P>They thought, it would be a good &s;ecurity for the Nation, to have a dormant title to the Crown lie as it were neglected, to oblige our Princes to govern well, while they would appre|hend the danger of a revolt to a pretender &s;till in their eye. <HI>Wildman</HI> thought, it was a deep piece of policy to let this lie in the dark, and undecided. Nor did they think it an ill pre|cedent, that they &s;hould &s;o neglect the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as not &s;o much as to enquire into this matter. Upon all the&s;e con&s;iderations no further enquiry was made into it. It is true, this put a plau&s;ible objection in the mouth of all King <HI>James</HI>'s party: Here, they &s;aid, an infant was condemned, and denied his right, without either proof or enquiry. This &s;till takes with many in the pre&s;ent age. And, that it may not take more in the next, I have u&s;ed more than ordinary care to gather together all the particulars that were then laid before me as to that matter.</P>
<P><PB N="818" REF="838">
The next thing in debate was, who &s;hould fill the Throne. The Marquis of <HI>Halli&s;ax</HI> intended, by his zeal for the Prince's intere&s;t, to atone for his backwardne&s;s in not coming early in|to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Some were for making the Prince King.</NOTE> it: And, that he might get before Lord <HI>Danby,</HI> who was in great credit with the Prince, he moved, that the Crown &s;hould be given to the Prince, and to the two Prince&s;&s;es after him. Ma|ny of the Republican party approved of this: For by it they gained another point: The people in this ca&s;e would plainly elect a King, without any critical regard to the order of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion. How far the Prince him&s;elf entertained this, I cannot tell. But I &s;aw it made a great impre&s;&s;ion on <HI>Benthink.</HI> He &s;poke of it to me, as a&s;king my opinion about it, but &s;o, that I plainly &s;aw what was his own: For he gave me all the ar|guments that were offered for it; as that it was mo&s;t natural that the &s;overeign power &s;hould be only in one per&s;on; that a man's wife ought only to be his wife; that it was a &s;uitable return to the Prince for what he had done for the Nation; that a divided &s;overeignty was liable to great inconveniencies; and, tho' there was le&s;s to be apprehended from the Prince&s;s of any thing of that kind than from any woman alive, yet all mortals were frail, and might at &s;ome time or other of their lives be wrought on.</P>
<P>To all this I an&s;wered, with &s;ome vehemence, that this was a very ill return for the &s;teps the Prince&s;s had made to the Prince three years ago: It would be thought both unju&s;t and ungrateful: It would meet with great oppo&s;ition, and give a general ill im|pre&s;&s;ion of the Prince, as in&s;atiable and jealous in his ambition: There was an ill humour already &s;preading it &s;elf thro' the Nation, and thro' the Clergy: It was not nece&s;&s;ary to encrea&s;e this; which &s;uch a &s;tep, as was now propo&s;ed, would do out of mea&s;ure: It would engage the one &s;ex generally again&s;t the Prince: And in time they might feel the effects of that very &s;en&s;ibly: And, for my own part, I &s;hould think my &s;elf bound to oppo&s;e it all I could, con&s;idering what had pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Hol|land</HI> on that head. We talked over the whole thing for many hours, till it was pretty far in the morning. I &s;aw he was well in&s;tructed in the argument: And he him&s;elf was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with it. So next morning I came to him, and de&s;ired my <HI>Cong&egrave;.</HI> I would oppo&s;e nothing in which the Prince &s;eemed to be con|cerned, as long as I was his &s;ervant. And therefore I de&s;ired to be di&s;engaged, that I might be free to oppo&s;e this pro|po&s;ition with all the &s;trength and credit I had. He an&s;wered me, that I might de&s;ire that when I &s;aw a &s;tep made: But till then he wi&s;hed me to &s;tay where I was. I heard no
<PB N="819" REF="839">
more of this; in which the Marquis of <HI>Hallifax</HI> was &s;ingle among the Peers: For I did not find there was any one of them of his mind; unle&s;s it was the Lord <HI>Culpepper,</HI> who was a vici|ous and corrupt man, but made a figure in the debates that were now in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and died about the end of them. Some moved, that the Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange</HI> might be put in the Throne; and that it might be left to her, to give the Prince &s;uch a &s;hare either of dignity or power as &s;he &s;hould propo&s;e, when &s;he was declared Queen. The agents of Prin|ce&s;s <HI>Anne</HI> began to go about, and to oppo&s;e any propo&s;ition for the Prince to her prejudice. But &s;he thought fit to di&s;own them. Dr. <HI>Doughty,</HI> one of her Chaplains, &s;poke to me in her room on the &s;ubject. But &s;he &s;aid to my &s;elf, that &s;he knew nothing of it.</P>
<P>The propo&s;ition, in which all that were for the filling the Throne agreed at la&s;t, was, that both the Prince and Prince&s;s &s;hould be made conjunct Sovereigns. But, for the preventing of any di&s;tractions, that the admini&s;tration &s;hould be &s;ingly in the Prince. The Prince&s;s continued all the while in <HI>Holland,</HI> being &s;hut in there, during the Ea&s;t winds, by the freezing of the rivers, and by contrary winds after the thaw came. So that &s;he came not to <HI>England</HI> till all the debates were over. The Prince's enemies gave it out, that &s;he was kept there by order, on de&s;ign that &s;he might not come over to <HI>England</HI> to claim her right. So parties began to be formed, &s;ome for the Prince, and others for the Prince&s;s. Upon this the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> &s;ent one over to the Prince&s;s, and gave her an account of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of that debate: And de&s;ired to know her own &s;en&s;e of the matter; for, if &s;he de&s;ired it, he did not doubt but he &s;hould be able to carry it for &s;etting her alone on the Throne. She made him a very &s;harp an&s;wer: She &s;aid, &s;he was the Prince's wife, and would never be other, than what &s;he &s;hould be in conjunction with him, and under him; and that &s;he would take it extream unkindly, if any, under a pretence of their care of her, would &s;et up a divided intere&s;t between her and the Prince. And, not content with this, &s;he &s;ent both Lord <HI>Danby</HI>'s letter, and her an&s;wer, to the Prince. Her &s;ending it thus to him was the mo&s;t effectual di&s;couragement po&s;&s;ible to any attempt for the future to create a mi&s;|under&s;tanding or jealou&s;y between them. The Prince bore this with his u&s;ual phlegm: For he did not expo&s;tulate with the Earl of <HI>Danby</HI> upon it, but continued &s;till to employ and to tru&s;t him. And afterwards he advanced him, fir&s;t to be a Marquis, and then to be a Duke.</P>
<P><PB N="820" REF="840">
During all the&s;e debates, and the great heat with which they were managed, the Prince's own behaviour was very my&s;terious. He &s;taid at St. <HI>James</HI>'s: He went little abroad: Acce&s;s to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince declared his mind after long &s;ilence.</NOTE> him was not very ea&s;y. He heard all that was &s;aid to him: But &s;eldom made any an&s;wers. He did not affect to be affable, or popular: Nor would he take any pains to gain any one per|&s;on over to his party. He &s;aid, he came over, being invited, to &s;ave the Nation: He had now brought together a free and true repre&s;entative of the Kingdom: He left it therefore to them to do what they thought be&s;t for the good of the Kingdom: And, when things were once &s;ettled, he &s;hould be well &s;atisfi|ed to go back to <HI>Holland</HI> again. Tho&s;e who did not know him well, and who imagined that a Crown had charms which human nature was not &s;trong enough to re&s;i&s;t, looked on all this as an affectation, and as a di&s;gui&s;ed threatning, which im|ported, that he would leave the Nation to peri&s;h, unle&s;s his method of &s;ettling it was followed. After a re&s;ervedne&s;s, that had continued &s;o clo&s;e for &s;everal weeks, that no body could certainly tell what he de&s;ired, he called for the Marquis of <HI>Hal|lifax,</HI> and the Earls of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> and <HI>Danby,</HI> and &s;ome others, to explain him&s;elf more di&s;tinctly to them.</P>
<P>He told them, he had been till then &s;ilent, becau&s;e he would not &s;ay or do any thing that might &s;eem in any &s;ort to take from any per&s;on the full freedom of deliberating and voting in matters of &s;uch importance: He was re&s;olved neither to court nor threaten any one: And therefore he had declined to give out his own thoughts: Some were for putting the government in the hands of a Regent: He would &s;ay nothing again&s;t it, if it was thought the be&s;t mean for &s;ettling their affairs: Only he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to tell them, that he would not be the Regent: So, if they continued in that de&s;ign, they mu&s;t look out for &s;ome other per&s;on to be put in that po&s;t: He him&s;elf &s;aw what the con&s;equences of it were like to prove: So he would not accept of it: Others were for putting the Prince&s;s &s;ingly on the Throne, and that he &s;hould reign by her courte&s;y: He &s;aid, no man could e&s;teem a woman more than he did the Prin|ce&s;s: But he was &s;o made, that he could not think of holding any thing by apron-&s;trings: Nor could he think it rea&s;onable to have any &s;hare in the government, unle&s;s it was put in his per&s;on, and that for term of life: If they did think it fit to &s;ettle it otherwi&s;e, he would not oppo&s;e them in it: But he would go back to <HI>Holland,</HI> and meddle no more in their affairs: He a&s;&s;ured them, that what&s;oever others might think of a Crown, it was no &s;uch thing in his eyes, but that he could live very
<PB N="821" REF="841">
well, and be well plea&s;ed without it. In the end he &s;aid, that he could not re&s;olve to accept of a dignity, &s;o as to hold it only the life of another: Yet he thought, that the i&s;&s;ue of Prince&s;s <HI>Anne</HI> &s;hould be preferred, in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, to any i&s;&s;ue that he might have by any other wife than the Prince&s;s. All this he delivered to them in &s;o cold and unconcerned a manner, that tho&s;e, who judged of others by the di&s;po&s;itions that they felt in them&s;elves, looked on it all as artifice and contrivance.</P>
<P>This was pre&s;ently told about, as it was not intended to be <NOTE PLACE="marg">It was re|&s;olved to put the Prince and Prince&s;s both in the Throne.</NOTE> kept &s;ecret. And it helped not a little to bring the debates at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> to a &s;peedy determination. Some were &s;till in doubt with relation to the Prince&s;s. In &s;ome it was con&s;cience: For they thought the equitable right was in her. Others might be moved by intere&s;t, &s;ince, if &s;he &s;hould think her&s;elf wronged, and ill u&s;ed in this matter, &s;he, who was like to outlive the Prince, being &s;o much younger and healthier than he was, might have it in her power to take her revenges on all that &s;hould concur in &s;uch a de&s;ign. Upon this, I, who knew her &s;en&s;e of the matter very perfectly by what had pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Hol|land,</HI> as was formerly told, was in a great difficulty. I had promi&s;ed her never to &s;peak of that matter, but by her order. But I pre&s;umed, in &s;uch a ca&s;e I was to take orders from the Prince. So I a&s;ked him, what he would order me to do. He &s;aid, he would give me no orders in that matter, but left me to do as I plea&s;ed. I looked on this, as the allowing me to let the Prince&s;s's re&s;olution in that be known; by which many, who &s;tood formerly in &s;u&s;pence, were fully &s;atisfied. Tho&s;e to whom I gave the account of that matter were indeed amazed at it; and concluded, that the Prince&s;s was either a very good, or a very weak woman. An indifferency for power and rule &s;eemed &s;o extraordinary a thing, that it was thought a certain cha|racter of an exce&s;s of goodne&s;s or &s;implicity. At her coming to <HI>England,</HI> &s;he not only ju&s;tified me, but approved of my pub|li&s;hing that matter, and &s;poke particularly of it to her &s;i&s;ter Prince&s;s <HI>Anne.</HI> There were other differences in the form of the &s;ettlement. The Republican party were at fir&s;t for depo&s;|ing King <HI>James</HI> by a formal &s;entence, and for giving the Crown to the Prince and Prince&s;s by as formal an election. But that was over-ruled in the beginning. I have not pur&s;ued the rela|tion of the debates according to the order in which they pa&s;&s;ed, which will be found in the journal of both Hou&s;es during the Convention. But, having had a great &s;hare my &s;elf in the pri|vate managing of tho&s;e debates, particularly with many of the Clergy, and with the men of the mo&s;t &s;crupulous and tender
<PB N="822" REF="842">
con&s;ciences, I have given a very full account of all the rea&s;on|ings on both &s;ides, as that by which the reader may form and guide his own judgment of the whole affair. Many prote&s;ta|tions pa&s;t in the Hou&s;e of Lords, in the progre&s;s of the de|bate. The party for a Regency was for &s;ome time mo&s;t prevailing: And then the prote&s;tations were made by the Lords that were for the new &s;ettlement. The Hou&s;e was very full: About a hundred and twenty were pre&s;ent. And things were &s;o near an equality, that it was at la&s;t carried by a very &s;mall majority, of two or three, to agree with the Commons in vot|ing the Abdication, and the Vacancy of the Throne: Again&s;t which a great prote&s;tation was made; as al&s;o again&s;t the final vote, by which the Prince and Prince&s;s of <HI>Orange</HI> were de&s;ired to accept of the Crown, and declared to be King and Queen; which went very hardly. The poor Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham,</HI> who had ab&s;conded for &s;ome time, and was waiting for a &s;hip to get beyond &s;ea, fearing publick affronts, and had offered to com|pound by re&s;igning his Bi&s;hoprick, was now prevailed on to come, and by voting the new &s;ettlement to merit at lea&s;t a par|don for all that he had done: Which, all things con&s;idered, was thought very indecent in him, yet not unbecoming the re&s;t of his life and character.</P>
<P>But, before matters were brought to a full conclu&s;ion, an enu|meration <NOTE PLACE="marg">They crew an In&s;tru|ment about $word$</NOTE> was made of the chief heads of King <HI>James</HI>'s ill go|vernment. And in oppo&s;ition to the&s;e, the rights and liberties of the people of <HI>England</HI> were &s;tated. Some officious people &s;tudied to hinder this at that time. They thought they had al|ready lo&s;t three weeks in their debates: And the doing this, with the exactne&s;s that was nece&s;&s;ary, would take up more time: Or it would be done too much in a hurry, for matters of &s;o nice a nature. And therefore it was moved, that this &s;hould be done more at lei&s;ure after the &s;ettlement. But that was not hearkned to. It was therefore thought nece&s;&s;ary to frame this In&s;trument &s;o, that it &s;hould be like a new <HI>Magna Charta.</HI> In the &s;tating the&s;e grievances and rights, the Di&s;pen&s;ing Power came to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. And then the power of the Crown to grant a <HI>Non-ob&s;tante</HI> to &s;ome &s;tatutes was objected. Upon opening this, the debate was found to be &s;o intricate, that it was let fall at that time only for di&s;patch. But afterwards an act pa&s;t condemning it &s;ingly. And the power of granting a <HI>Non|ob&s;tante</HI> was for the future taken away. Yet King <HI>James</HI>'s party took great advantage from this; and &s;aid, that, tho' the main clamour of the Nation was again&s;t the Di&s;pen&s;ing Power, yet when the Convention brought things to a &s;ettlement, that did
<PB N="823" REF="843">
not appear to be &s;o clear a point as had been pretended: And it was not &s;o much as mentioned in this In&s;trument of government: So that, by the confe&s;&s;ion of his enemies, it appeared to be no un|lawful power: Nor was it declared contrary to the liberties of the people of <HI>England.</HI> Whereas, its not being mentioned then was only upon the oppo&s;ition that was made, that &s;o more time might not be lo&s;t, nor this In&s;trument be clogged with di&s;putable points.</P>
<P>The la&s;t debate was, concerning the oaths that &s;hould be <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Oathe were alter|ed.</NOTE> taken to the King and Queen. Many arguments were taken during the debate from the oaths in the form in which the al|legiance was &s;worn to the Crown, to &s;hew that in a new &s;et|tlement the&s;e could not be taken. And to this it was always an&s;wered, that care &s;hould be taken, when other things were &s;ettled, to adju&s;t the&s;e oaths, &s;o that they &s;hould agree to the new &s;ettlement. In the oaths, as they were formerly conceiv|ed, a previous title &s;eemed to be a&s;&s;erted, when the King was &s;worn to, <HI>as rightful and lawful King.</HI> It was therefore &s;aid, that the&s;e words could not be &s;aid of a King who had not a precedent right, but was &s;et up by the Nation. So it was mov|ed, that the oaths &s;hould be reduced to the ancient &s;implicity, of &s;wearing to bear faith and true allegiance to the King and Queen. This was agreed to. And upon this began the noti|on of a King <HI>de facto,</HI> but not <HI>de jure.</HI> It was &s;aid, that ac|cording to the common law, as well as the &s;tatute in King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh's reign, the &s;ubjects might &s;ecurely obey any King that was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, whether his title was good, or not. This &s;eemed to be a doctrine nece&s;&s;ary for the peace and quiet of mankind, that &s;o the &s;ubjects may be &s;afe in every Govern|ment, that bringeth them under a &s;uperior force, and that will cru&s;h them, if they do not give a &s;ecurity for the protection that they enjoy under it. The Lawyers had been always of that opinion, that the people were not bound to examine the titles of their Princes, but were to &s;ubmit to him that was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. It was therefore judged ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, in the beginning of a new government, to make the oaths as general and com|prehen&s;ive as might be: For it was thought, that tho&s;e who once took the oaths to the government, would be after that faithful and true to it. This tenderne&s;s, which was &s;hewed at this time to a &s;ort of people that had &s;hewed very little ten|derne&s;s to men of weak or ill informed con&s;ciences, was after|wards much abu&s;ed by a new explanation, or rather a gro&s;s equi|vocation, as to the &s;ignification of the words in which the oath was conceived. The true meaning of the words, and the expre&s;s &s;en&s;e of the impo&s;ers was, that, whether men were &s;atisfied or
<PB N="824" REF="844">
not with the putting the King and Queen on the Throne, yet, now they were on it, they would be true to them, and defend them. But the &s;en&s;e that many put on them was, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">The ill &s;en&s;e that was put on the new oath.</NOTE> they were only to obey them as u&s;urpers, during their u&s;urpati|on, and that therefore, as long as they continued in quiet po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, they were bound to bear them, and to &s;ubmit to them: But that it was &s;till lawful for them to a&s;&s;i&s;t King <HI>James,</HI> if he &s;hould come to recover his Crown, and that they might act and talk all they could, or dur&s;t, in his favour, as being &s;till their King <HI>de jure.</HI> This was contrary to the plain meaning of the words; <HI>faith, and true allegiance;</HI> and was contrary to the ex|pre&s;s declaration in the act that enjoined them. Yet it became too vi&s;ible, that many in the Nation, and particularly among the Clergy, took the oath in this &s;en&s;e, to the great reproach of their profe&s;&s;ion. The prevarication of too many in &s;o &s;a|cred a matter contributed not a little to fortify the growing Athei&s;m of the pre&s;ent age. The truth was, the greate&s;t part of the Clergy had entangled them&s;elves &s;o far with tho&s;e &s;trange conceits of the divine right of Monarchy, and the unlawfulne&s;s of re&s;i&s;tance in any ca&s;e: And they had &s;o engaged them&s;elves, by a&s;|&s;erting the&s;e things &s;o often and &s;o publickly, that they did not know how to di&s;engage them&s;elves in honour or con&s;cience.</P>
<P>A notion was &s;tarted, which by its agreement with their other principles had a great effect among them, and brought off the greate&s;t number of tho&s;e who came in hone&s;tly to the new go|vernment. This was chiefly managed by Dr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> Bi&s;hop of St. <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> now tran&s;lated to <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI> It was laid thus: The Prince had a ju&s;t cau&s;e of making war on the King. In that mo&s;t of them agreed. In a ju&s;t war, in which an appeal is made to God, &s;ucce&s;s is con&s;idered as the deci&s;ion of heaven. So the Prince's &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t King <HI>James</HI> gave him the right of con|que&s;t over him. And by it all his rights were transferred to the Prince. His &s;ucce&s;s was indeed no conque&s;t of the Nation; which had neither wronged him, nor re&s;i&s;ted him. So that, with relation to the people of <HI>England,</HI> the Prince was no con|queror, but a pre&s;erver, and a deliverer, well received, and gratefully acknowledged. Yet with relation to King <HI>James,</HI> and all the right that was before ve&s;ted in him, he was, as they thought, a conqueror. By this notion they explained tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture that &s;peak of God's di&s;po&s;ing of Kingdoms, and of pulling down one and &s;etting up another; and al&s;o our Saviour's arguing from the in&s;cription on the coin, that they ought to render to <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> the things that were <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s; and St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s charging the <HI>Romans</HI> to obey the powers that then were,
<PB N="825" REF="845">
who were the Emperors that were originally the invaders of pub|lick liberty which they had &s;ubdued, and had forced the people and Senate of <HI>Rome</HI> by &s;ub&s;equent acts to confirm an authority that was &s;o ill begun. This might have been made u&s;e of more ju&s;tly, if the Prince had a&s;&s;umed the King&s;hip to him&s;elf, upon King <HI>James</HI>'s withdrawing; but did not &s;eem to belong to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Yet this had the mo&s;t univer&s;al effect on the far greater part of the Clergy.</P>
<P>And now I have &s;tated all the mo&s;t material parts of the&s;e debates, with the fulne&s;s that I thought became one of the mo&s;t important tran&s;actions that is in our whole Hi&s;tory, and by much the mo&s;t important of our time.</P>
<P>All things were now made ready for filling the Throne. And <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prin|ce&s;s came to <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> the very night before it was to be done the Prince&s;s arriv'd &s;afely. It had been given out, that &s;he was not well plea&s;ed with the late tran&s;action, both with relation to her father and to the pre&s;ent &s;et|tlement. Upon which the Prince wrote to her, that it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould appear at fir&s;t &s;o chearful, that no body might be di&s;couraged by her looks, or be led to apprehend that &s;he was unea&s;y by rea&s;on of what had been done. This made her put on a great air of gaiety when &s;he came to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> and, as may be imagined, had great crouds of all &s;orts coming to wait on her. I confe&s;s, I was one of tho&s;e that cen&s;ured this in my thoughts. I thought a little more &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s had done as well, when &s;he came into her father's Palace, and was to be &s;et on his Throne next day. I had never &s;een the lea&s;t indecency in any part of her deportment before: Which made this appear to me &s;o extraordi|nary, that &s;ome days after I took the liberty to a&s;k her, how it came that what &s;he &s;aw in &s;o &s;ad a revolution, as to her father's per&s;on, made not a greater impre&s;&s;ion on her. She took this freedom with her u&s;ual goodne&s;s. And &s;he a&s;&s;ured me, &s;he felt the &s;en&s;e of it very lively upon her thoughts. But &s;he told me, that the letters which had been writ to her had obliged her to put on a chearfulne&s;s, in which &s;he might perhaps go too far, be|cau&s;e &s;he was obeying directions, and acting a part which was not very natural to her. This was on the 12^t^h of <HI>February,</HI> being <HI>Shrove-Tue&s;day.</HI> The thirteenth was the day &s;et for the two Hou&s;es to come with the offer of the Crown. So here ends the <HI>Interregnum.</HI></P>
<P>And thus I have given the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t particular account that I could gather of all that pa&s;s'd during this weak, unactive, violent, and &s;uper&s;titious reign; in which all regard to the affairs of <HI>Europe</HI> &s;eem'd to be laid a&s;ide, and nothing was thought on but the &s;pitefull humours of a revengeful <HI>Italian</HI> Lady, and the ill laid,
<PB N="826" REF="846">
and wor&s;e managed, projects of &s;ome hot meddling Prie&s;ts, who&s;e learning and politicks were of a piece, the one expo&s;ing them to contempt, and the other to ruin; involving in it a Prince, who, if it had not been for his being delivered up to &s;uch coun&s;els, might have made a better figure in hi&s;tory. But they managed both them&s;elves and him &s;o ill, that a reign, who&s;e ri&s;e was bright and pro&s;perous, was &s;oon &s;et in darkne&s;s and di&s;grace. But I break off here, le&s;t I &s;hould &s;eem to aggravate misfortunes, and load the unfortunate too much.</P>
