<P>THE purcha&s;ers of D. Hume's Hi&s;tory of
England having been long de&s;irous of a continu|ation;
the proprietor of Dr. Smollet's Hi&s;tory
(being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a copy with the author's
la&s;t corrections) has been induced to reprint
that work, from the Revolution, where Hume's
Hi&s;tory ends, to the death of George II. in the
year 1760.</P>
<P>To make this work more acceptable, the Sec|tions,
and other divi&s;ions, are given in a manner
corre&s;pondent with tho&s;e ob&s;erved by Hume; &s;o
that any gentleman, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the latter, may
take up his Hi&s;tory at the Revolution, where Hume
breaks off, and find a regular connexion in this
complete Hi&s;tory given by Smollet.</P>
<P>In the latter part only of this work has the pre&s;ent
Editor found it nece&s;&s;ary to make any alterations.
The war before the la&s;t had its &s;ource in America,
and thereby drew forth our &s;ettlements there into
con&s;equence. This with the lo&s;s of mo&s;t of tho&s;e
&s;ettlements &s;ince to Great-Britain, had brought
<PB REF="4">
with it &s;o many changes, that what was &s;ound
politicks and good &s;en&s;e then, is now totally de|ranged;
even facts them&s;elves are become changed,
and the very &s;tate of the two countries has under|gone
a metamorpho&s;is which was impo&s;&s;ible to be
fore&s;een by the &s;hrewde&s;t politician. To a&s;&s;i&s;t the
views of &s;o eminent a writer as Smollet, as well
as to gratify the expectations of the judicious
reader, a few, very few, alterations have been
made on tho&s;e heads. To have proceeded farther
would have been a kind of &s;acrilege, and no le&s;s a
fraud upon the original author, than upon the
publick.</P>

&sect; I. THE con&s;titution of England had now a&s;|&s;umed
a new a&s;pect.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1689.</NOTE> The maxim of here|ditary,
indefea&s;ible right was at length renounced
by a free parliament. The power of the crown was
<PB N="3" REF="7">
acknowledged to flow from no other fountain than
that of a contract with the people.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I. 1689.</NOTE> Allegiance and pro|tection
were declared reciprocal ties depending upon each
other. The repre&s;entatives of the nation made a regular
claim of rights in behalf of their con&s;tituents; and Wil|liam
III. a&s;cended the throne in con&s;equence of an expre&s;s
capitulation with the people. Yet, on this occa&s;ion, the
zeal of the parliament towards their deliverer &s;eems to
have over&s;hot their attachment to their own liberty and
privileges: or at lea&s;t they neglected the faire&s;t oppor|tunity
that ever occurred, to retrench tho&s;e prerogatives
of the crown to which they imputed all the late and former
calamities of the kingdom. Their new monarch retained
the old regal power over parliaments in its full extent.
He was left at liberty to convoke, adjourn, prorogue, and
di&s;&s;olve them at his plea&s;ure. He was enabled to influence
elections, and oppre&s;s corporations. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the right
of choo&s;ing his own council; of nominating all the great
officers of the &s;tate, and of the hou&s;ehold, of the army, the
navy, and the church. He re&s;erved the ab&s;olute com|mand
of the militia: &s;o that he remained ma&s;ter of all
the in&s;truments and engines of corruption and violence,
without any other re&s;traint than his own moderation, and
prudent regard to the claim of rights, and principle of
re&s;i&s;tance, on which the Revolution was founded. In a
word, the &s;ettlement was fini&s;hed with &s;ome precipitation,
before the plan had been properly dige&s;ted and matured;
and this will be the ca&s;e in every e&s;tabli&s;hment formed
upon a &s;udden emergency in the face of oppo&s;ition. It
was ob&s;erved, that the King, who was made by the people,
had it in his power to rule without them; to govern <HI>jure
divino,</HI> though he was created <HI>jure humano;</HI> and that,
though the change proceeded from a republican &s;pirit, the
&s;ettlement was built upon Tory maxims; for the execution
of his government continued &s;till independent of his com|mi&s;&s;ion,
while his own per&s;on remained &s;acred and in|violable.
The Prince of Orange had been invited to
England by a coalition of parties, united by a common
<PB N="4" REF="8">
&s;en&s;e of danger: but this tie was no &s;ooner broken than
they flew a&s;under, and each re&s;umed its original bia&s;s.
Their mutual jealou&s;y and rancour revived, and was
heated by di&s;pute into intemperate zeal and enthu&s;ia&s;m.
Tho&s;e who at fir&s;t acted from principles of patrioti&s;m
were in&s;en&s;ibly warmed into parti&s;ans; and King William
&s;oon found him&s;elf at the head of a faction. As he had
been bred a Calvini&s;t, and always expre&s;&s;ed an abhorrence
of &s;piritual per&s;ecution, the pre&s;byterians, and other pro|te&s;tant
di&s;&s;enters, con&s;idered him as their peculiar pro|tector,
and entered into his intere&s;ts with the mo&s;t zealous
fervour and a&s;&s;iduity. For the &s;ame rea&s;ons, the friends
of the church became jealous of his proceedings, and em|ployed
all their influence, fir&s;t in oppo&s;ing his elevation to
the throne, and afterwards in thwarting his mea&s;ures.
Their party was e&s;pou&s;ed by all the friends of the lineal
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion; by the roman catholics; by tho&s;e who were
per&s;onally attached to the late King; and by &s;uch as were
di&s;gu&s;ted by the conduct and per&s;onal deportment of Wil|liam
&s;ince his arrival in England. They ob&s;erved, That,
contrary to his declaration, he had plainly a&s;pired to the
crown; and treated his father-in-law with in&s;olence and
rigour: That his army contained a number of foreign
papi&s;ts, almo&s;t equal to that of the Engli&s;h roman catho|lics
whom James had employed: That the reports &s;o in|du&s;triou&s;ly
circulated about the birth of the Prince of
Wales, the treaty with France for en&s;laving England,
and the murder of the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, reports countenanced
by the Prince of Orange, now appeared to be without
foundation: That the Dutch troops remained in London,
while the Engli&s;h forces were di&s;tributed in remote quar|ters:
That the Prince declared the fir&s;t &s;hould be kept
about his per&s;on, and the latter &s;ent to Ireland: That the
two Hou&s;es, out of complai&s;ance to William, had denied
their late &s;overeign the ju&s;tice of being heard in his own
defence; and, That the Dutch had lately interfered with
the trade of London, which was already &s;en&s;ibly dimi|ni&s;hed.
<PB N="5" REF="9">
The&s;e were the &s;ources of di&s;content, &s;welled up by
the re&s;entment of &s;ome noblemen, and other individuals,
di&s;appointed in their hopes of profit and preferment.</P>
<P>&sect; II. William began his reign with a proclamation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Somers's Collection. Rere&s;by. Burnet.</NOTE>
for confirming all prote&s;tants in the offices which they
enjoyed on the fir&s;t day of December: then he cho&s;e the
members of his council, who were generally &s;taunch to
his intere&s;t, except the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and the
Earl of Nottingham<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The council con&s;i&s;ted of the Prince of Denmark, the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, the Duke of Norfolk, the Marqui&s;&s;es of Hallifax and Winche&s;ter, the Earls of Danby, Lind&s;ey, Devon&s;hire, Dor&s;et, Middle&s;ex, Oxford, Shrew&s;bury, Bedford, B$$h, Maccl$$field, and Nottingham; the Vi&s;counts Fauconberg, Mordaunt, Newport, Lumley; the Lords Wharton, Monta|gue, Delamere, Churchill; Mr. Bentinck, Mr. Sidney, Sir Robert Howard, Sir Henry Capel, Mr. Powle, Mr. Ru&s;&s;el, Mr. Hambden, and Mr. Bo&s;eawen.</NOTE>; and the&s;e were admitted in com|plai&s;ance
to the church-party, which it was not thought
advi&s;eable to provoke. Nottingham and Shrew&s;bury were
appointed &s;ecretaries of &s;tate: the privy-&s;eal was be&s;towed
upon the Marquis of Hallifax: the Earl of Danby was
created pre&s;ident of the council. The&s;e two noblemen
enjoyed a good &s;hare of the King's confidence, and Not|tingham
was con&s;iderable, as head of the church-party:
but the chief favourite was Bentinck, fir&s;t commoner on
the li&s;t of privy-coun&s;ellors, as well as groom of the &s;tole
and privy pur&s;e. D'Auverquerque was made ma&s;ter of
the hor&s;e, Zuyle&s;tein of the robes, and Schomberg of the
ordnance: the Trea&s;ury, Admiralty, and Chancery were
put in commi&s;&s;ion: twelve able judges were cho&s;en<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sir John Holt was appointed Lord-Chief-Ju&s;tice of the King's-Bench, and Sir Henry Pollex&s;en of the Common-Pleas: the Earl of Devon&s;hire was made lord-&s;teward of the hou&s;ehold, and the Earl of Dor&s;et lord-chamber|lain.&mdash;Ralph.</NOTE>;
and the dioce&s;e of Sali&s;bury being vacated by the death of
Dr. Ward, the King, of his own free motion, filled it
with Burnet, who had been a zealous &s;tickler for his
intere&s;t; and, in a particular manner, in&s;trumental in
effecting the Revolution. Sancroft, Archbi&s;hop of Can|terbury,
<PB N="6" REF="10">
refu&s;ed to con&s;ecrate this eccle&s;ia&s;tic, though
the rea&s;ons of his refu&s;al are not &s;pecified; but, being
afraid of incurring the penalties of a premunire, he granted
a commi&s;&s;ion to the Bi&s;hop of London, and three other
&s;uffragans, to perform that ceremony. Burnet was a
prelate of &s;ome parts, and great indu&s;try; moderate in his
notions of church-di&s;cipline, inqui&s;itive, medling, vain,
and credulous. In con&s;equence of having incurred the
di&s;plea&s;ure of the late King, he had retired to the conti|nent,
and fixed his re&s;idence in Holland, where he was
naturalized, and attached him&s;elf to the intere&s;t of the
Prince of Orange, who con&s;ulted him about the affairs of
England. He a&s;&s;i&s;ted in drawing up the Prince's manife&s;to,
and wrote &s;ome other papers and pamphlets in defence of
his de&s;ign. He was demanded of the States, by the
Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, as a Briti&s;h fugitive, outlawed by
King James, and excepted in the act of indemnity: never|thele&s;s,
he come over with William, in quality of his
chaplain; and, by his intrigues, contributed in &s;ome
mea&s;ure to the &s;ucce&s;s of that expedition. The principal
individuals that compo&s;ed this mini&s;try have been cha|racteri&s;ed
in the hi&s;tory of the preceding reigns. We
have had occa&s;ion to mention the fine talents, the vivacity,
the flexibility of Hallifax; the plau&s;ibility, the enter|pri&s;ing
genius, the ob&s;tinacy of Danby; the pompous
eloquence, the warmth, and o&s;tentation of Notingham;
the probity and popularity of Shrew&s;bury. Godolphin,
now brought into the Trea&s;ury, was mode&s;t, &s;ilent, &s;aga|cious,
and upright. Mordaunt, appointed fir&s;t com|mi&s;&s;ioner
of that board, and afterwards created Earl of
Monmouth, was open, generous, and a republican in
his principles. Delamere, chancellor of the exchequer,
promoted in the &s;equel to the rank of Earl of Warrington,
was clo&s;e and mercenary. Ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s, fidelity, and
attachment to his ma&s;ter, compo&s;ed the character of
Bentinck, whom the king rai&s;ed to the dignity of Earl of
Portland. The Engli&s;h favourite, Sidney, was a man of
wit and plea&s;ure, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t engaging talents for
<PB N="7" REF="11">
conver&s;ation and private friend&s;hip, but rendered unfit
for public bu&s;ine&s;s by indolence and inattention. He
was ennobled and afterwards created Earl of Romney;
a title which he enjoyed with &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive po&s;ts of
profit and importance. The &s;tream of honour and
preferment ran &s;trong in favour of the Whigs, and this
appearance of partiality confirmed the &s;u&s;picion and re|&s;entment
of the oppo&s;ite party.</P>
<P>&sect; III. The fir&s;t re&s;olution taken in the new council
was to convert the convention into a parliament, that the
new &s;ettlement might be &s;trengthened by a legal &s;anction,
which was now &s;uppo&s;ed to be wanting, as the a&s;&s;embly
had not been convoked by the King's writ of &s;ummons.
The experiment of a new election was deemed too hazar|dous;
therefore, the council determined that the King
&s;hould, by virtue of his own authority, change the con|vention
into a parliament, by going to the Hou&s;e of Peers
with the u&s;ual &s;tate of a &s;overeign, and pronouncing a
&s;peech from the throne to both Hou&s;es. This expedient
was accordingly practi&s;ed<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This expedient was attended with an in&s;urmountable ab&s;urdity. If the majority of the convention could not grant a legal &s;anction to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment they had made, they could never inve&s;t the Prince of Orange with a ju&s;t right to a&s;cend the throne; for they could not give what they had no right to be&s;tow, and if he a&s;cended the throne without a ju&s;t title, he could have no right to &s;anctify that a&s;&s;embly to which he owed his elevation. When the people are obliged by tyranny, or other accidents, to have recour&s;e to the fir&s;t principles of &s;ociety, namely their own pre&s;ervation, in electing a new &s;overeign, it will de&s;erve con&s;ideration, whether that choice is to be effected by the majority of a parliament which has been di&s;&s;olved, indeed by any par|liament what&s;oever, or by the body of the nation a&s;&s;embled in communi|ties, corporations, by tribes or centuries, to &s;ignify their a&s;&s;ent or di&s;&s;ent with re&s;pect to the per&s;on propo&s;ed as their &s;overeign This kind of election might be attended with great inconvenience and difficulty, but the&s;e can|not po&s;&s;ibly be avoided when the con&s;titution is di&s;&s;olved by &s;etting a &s;ide the lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne. The con&s;titution of England is founded on a parliament con&s;i&s;ting of King, Lords, and Commons; But when there is no longer a King, the parliament is defective, and the con&s;titution impaired: the members of the Lower Hou&s;e are the repre&s;entatives of the people, ex|pre&s;sly cho&s;en to maintain the con&s;titution in church and &s;tate, and &s;worn to &s;upport the rights of the crown, as well as the liberties of the nation; but though they are elected to maintain, they have no power to alter the con&s;titution. When the King forfeits the allegiance of his &s;ubjects, and it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to de$hrone him, the power of &s;o doing cannot po&s;&s;ibly re&s;ide in the repre&s;entatives who are cho&s;en, under certain limitations, for the purpo&s;es of a legi&s;lature which no longer exi&s;ts; their power is of cour&s;e at an end, and they are reduced to a level with other individuals that con&s;titute the community. The right of altering the con&s;titution, therefore, or of deviating from the e&s;tabli&s;hed practice of inheritance in regard to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown, is inherent in the body of the people, and every individual has an equal right to his &s;hare in the general determination, whether his opinion be &s;ignified <HI>viva voce,</HI> or by a repre&s;entative whom he appoints and in&s;tructs for the purpo&s;e. It may be &s;ugge&s;ted that the Prince of Orange was rai&s;ed to the throne without any convul&s;ion, or any &s;uch difficulties and inconveniencies as we have affirmed to be the nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equences of a mea&s;ure of that nature. To this remark we an&s;wer, that &s;ince the Revolution the&s;e kingdoms have been divided and barra&s;&s;ed by vio|lent and implacable factions, that eagerly &s;eek the de&s;truction of each other; that they have been expo&s;ed to plots, con&s;piracies, in&s;urrections, civil wars, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive rebellions, which have not been defeated and quelled with|out va&s;t effu&s;ion of blood, infinite mi&s;chief, calamity, and expence to the nation; that they are &s;till &s;ubjected to all tho&s;e alarms and dangers which are engendered by a di&s;puted title to the throne, and the efforts of an artful Pretender; that they are nece&s;&s;arily wedded to the affairs of the continent, and their intere&s;t &s;acrificed to foreign connexions, of which they can never be di&s;engaged. Perhaps all the&s;e calamities might have been prevented by the interpo&s;ition of the Prince of Orange. King James, without forfeit|ing the crown, might have been laid under &s;uch re&s;trictions that it would not have been in his power to tyrannize over his &s;ubjects either in &s;pirituals or temporals. The power of the militia might have been ve&s;ted in the two Hou&s;es of parliament, as well as the nomination of per&s;ons to fill the great offices of the church and &s;tate, and &s;uperintend the oeconomy of the admi|ni&s;tration, in the application of the publick money: a law might have pa&s;&s;ed for annual parliaments, and the King might have been deprived of his power to convoke, adjourn, prorogue, and di&s;&s;olve them at his plea&s;ure. Had the&s;e mea&s;ures been taken, the King mu&s;t have been ab&s;olutely di&s;abled from employing either force or corruption in the pro&s;ecution of arbitrary de&s;igns, and the people mu&s;t have been fairly repre&s;ented in a rotation of parlia|ments who&s;e power and influence would have been but of one year's du|ration.</NOTE>. He a&s;&s;ured them he &s;hould
<PB N="8" REF="12">
never take any &s;tep that would dimini&s;h the good opinion
they had conceived of his integrity. He told them that
Holland was in &s;uch a &s;ituation as required their imme|diate
attention and a&s;&s;i&s;tance: that the po&s;ture of affairs
at home likewi&s;e demanded their &s;erious con&s;ideration:
that a good &s;ettlement was nece&s;&s;ary, not only for the
<PB N="9" REF="13">
e&s;tabli&s;hment of dome&s;tic peace, but al&s;o for the &s;upport
of the prote&s;tant intere&s;t abroad: that the affairs of Ireland
were too critically &s;ituated to admit of the lea&s;t delay in
their deliberations: he, therefore, begged they would be
&s;peedy and effectual in concerting &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;hould
be judged indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary for the welfare of the
nation. The Commons returning to their hou&s;e, imme|diately
pa&s;&s;ed a vote of thanks to his Maje&s;ty, and made
an order that his &s;peech &s;hould be taken into con&s;idera|tion.
After the throne had been declared vacant by a
&s;mall majority of the peers, tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed that mea|&s;ure
had gradually withdrawn them&s;elves from the Hou&s;e;
&s;o that very few remained but &s;uch as were devoted to the
new monarch. The&s;e, therefore, brought in a bill for
preventing all di&s;putes concerning the pre&s;ent parliament.
In the mean time, Mr. Hambden in the Lower Hou&s;e put
the que&s;tion, Whether a king elected by the Lords Spiritual
and Temporal, and the Commons a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin|&s;ter,
coming to and con&s;ulting with the &s;aid Lords and
Commons, did not make as complete a parliament, and
legi&s;lative power and authority, as if the &s;aid king &s;hould
cau&s;e new elections to be made by writ? Many members
affirmed, that the King's writ was as nece&s;&s;ary as his pre|&s;ence
to the being of a legal parliament, and, as the
convention was defective in this particular, it could not
be ve&s;ted with a parliamentary authority by any manage|ment
what&s;oever. The Whigs replied, That the e&s;&s;ence
of a parliament con&s;i&s;ted in the meeting and co-operation
of the King, Lords, and Commons; and that it was not
material whether they were convoked by writ or by letter:
they proved this a&s;&s;ertion by examples deduced from the
hi&s;tory of England: they ob&s;erved, that a new election
would be attended with great trouble, expence, and lo&s;s
of time; and that &s;uch delay might prove fatal to the
prote&s;tant intere&s;t in Ireland, as well as to the allies on
the continent. In the mid&s;t of this debate, the bill was
brought down from the Lords, and being read, a committee
was appointed to make &s;ome amendments. The&s;e were
<PB N="10" REF="14">
no &s;ooner made than the Commons &s;ent it back to the
Upper Hou&s;e, and it immediately received the royal a&s;&s;ent.
By this act the Lords and Commons a&s;&s;embled at We&s;t|min&s;ter
were declared the two Hou&s;es of parliament to
all intents and purpo&s;es: it likewi&s;e ordained, That the
pre&s;ent act, and all other acts to which the royal a&s;&s;ent
&s;hould be given before the next prorogation, &s;hould be
under&s;tood and adjudged in law to begin on the thirteenth
day of February: That the members, in&s;tead of the old
oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy, &s;hould take the new
oath incorporated in this act under the ancient penalty;
and, That the pre&s;ent parliament &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved in
the u&s;ual manner. Immediately after this tran&s;action, a
warm debate aro&s;e in the Hou&s;e of Commons about the
revenue which the courtiers alledged had devolved with
the crown upon William, at lea&s;t, during the life of
James; for which term the greater part of it had been
granted. The members in the oppo&s;ition affirmed that
the&s;e grants were vacated with the throne; and at length
it was voted, That the revenue had expired. Then a
motion was made, That a revenue &s;hould be &s;ettled on
the King and Queen; and the Hou&s;e re&s;olved it &s;hould be
taken into con&s;ideration. While they deliberated on this
affair, they received a me&s;&s;age from his Maje&s;ty, im|porting,
that the late King had &s;et &s;ail from Bre&s;t with an
armament to invade Ireland. They forthwith re&s;olved to
a&s;&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty with their lives and fortunes: they voted
a temporary aid of four hundred and twenty thou&s;and
pounds, to be levied by monthly a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment; and both
Hou&s;es waited on the King to &s;ignify this re&s;olution. But
this unanimity did not take place till &s;everal Lords
&s;piritual as well as temporal had, rather than take the
oaths, ab&s;ented them&s;elves from parliament. The non|juring
prelates were Sancro$t, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury,
Turner, Bi&s;hop of Ely, Lake, of Chiche&s;ter, Ken, of
Bath and Wells, White, of Peterborough, Lloyd, of
Norwich, Thomas, of Worce&s;ter, and Frampton, of
Glouce&s;ter. The temporal peers who refu&s;ed the oath,
<PB N="11" REF="15">
were the Duke of Newca&s;tle, the Earls of Clarendon,
Litchfield, Exeter, Yarmouth, and Stafford; the Lords
Griffin and Stawel. Five of the bi&s;hops withdrew them|&s;elves
from the Hou&s;e at one time: but, before they re|tired,
one of the number moved for a bill of toleration,
and another of comprehen&s;ion, by which moderate
di&s;&s;enters might be reconciled to the church, and admitted
into eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices. Such bills were actually pre|pared
and pre&s;ented by the Earl of Nottingham, who
received the thanks of the Hou&s;e for the pains he had taken.
From this period, the party aver&s;e to the government of
William were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of Non|jurors.
They rejected the notion of a king <HI>de facto,</HI> as
well as all other di&s;tinctions and limitations; and declared
for the ab&s;olute power, and divine hereditary indefea&s;ible
right of &s;overeigns.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. This faction had already begun to practi&s;e again&s;t
the new government. The King having received &s;ome
intimation of their de&s;igns from intercepted letters,
ordered the Earl of Arran, Sir Robert Hamilton, and
&s;ome other gentlemen of the Scotti&s;h nation, to be appre|hended,
and &s;ent pri&s;oners to the Tower. Then he in|formed
the two Hou&s;es of the &s;tep he had taken, and even
craved their advice with regard to his conduct in &s;uch a
delicate affair, which had compelled him to tre&s;pa&s;s upon
the law of England. The Lords thanked him for the care
he took of their liberties, and de&s;ired he would &s;ecure all
di&s;turbers of the peace: but the Commons empowered
him by a bill to di&s;pen&s;e with the Habeas Corpus act till
the &s;eventeenth day of April next en&s;uing. This was a
&s;tretch of confidence in the crown which had not been
made in favour of the late King, even while Argyle and
Monmouth were in open rebellion. A &s;pirit of di&s;content
had by this time diffu&s;ed it&s;elf through the army, and
become &s;o formidable to the court, that the King re&s;olved
to retain the Dutch troops in England, and &s;end over to
Holland in their room &s;uch regiments as were mo&s;t
tinctured with di&s;affection. Of the&s;e the Scotti&s;h regiment
<PB N="12" REF="16">
of Dumbarton, commanded by Mare&s;chal Schomberg,
mutinied on its march to Ip&s;wich, &s;ei&s;ed the military
che&s;t, di&s;armed the officers who oppo&s;ed their de&s;ign,
declared for King James, and with four pieces of cannon
began their march for Scotland. William being informed
of this revolt, ordered General Ginckel to pur&s;ue them
with three regiments of Dutch dragoons, and the muti|neers
&s;urrendered at di&s;cretion. As the delinquents were
natives of Scotland, which had not yet &s;ubmitted in form
to the new government, the King did not think proper to
puni&s;h them as rebels, but ordered them to proceed for
Holland, according to his fir&s;t intention. Though this
attempt proved abortive, it made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion upon
the mini&s;try, who were divided among them&s;elves, and
wavered in their principles. However, they &s;ei&s;ed this
opportunity to bring in a bill for puni&s;hing mutiny and
de&s;ertion, which in a little time pa&s;&s;ed both Hou&s;es, and
received the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>&sect; V. The coronation-oath<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The new form of the coronation-oath con&s;i&s;ted in the following que&s;tions and an&s;wers. &startq;Will you &s;olemnly promi&s;e and &s;wear to govern the people of this kingdom of England, and the dominions thereto be|longing, according to the &s;tatutes in parliament agreed on, and the laws and cu&s;toms of the &s;ame?&endq;</P>

that ceremony was performed on the eleventh day of April,
the Bi&s;hop of London officiating, at the king's de&s;ire, in
the room of the metropolitan, who was a malcontent; and
next day the Commons, in a body, waited on the King
and Queen at Whitehall, with an addre&s;s of congratula|tion.
<PB N="13" REF="17">
William, with a view to conciliate the affection
of his new &s;ubjects, and check the progre&s;s of clamour
and di&s;content, &s;ignified, in a &s;olemn me&s;&s;age to the
Hou&s;e of Commons, his readine&s;s to acquie&s;ce in any
mea&s;ure they &s;hould think proper to take for a new regu|lation
or total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the hearth-money, which he
under&s;tood was a grievous impo&s;ition on the &s;ubjects; and
this tax was afterwards aboli&s;hed. He was gratified with
an addre&s;s of thanks, couched in the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions
of duty, gratitude, and affection, declaring they would
take &s;uch mea&s;ures in &s;upport of his crown, as would
convince the world that he reigned in the hearts of his
people.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. He had, in his an&s;wer to their former addre&s;s,
a&s;&s;ured them of his con&s;tant regard to the rights and
pro&s;perity of the nation: he had explained the exhau&s;ted
&s;tate of the Dutch; expatiated upon the zeal of that re|public
for the intere&s;ts of Britain, as well as the mainte|nance
of the prote&s;tant religion; and expre&s;&s;ed his hope
that the Engli&s;h parliament would not only repay the
&s;ums they had expended in his expedition, but likewi&s;e
further &s;upport them to the utmo&s;t of their ability
again&s;t the common enemies of their liberties and religion.
He had ob&s;erved that a con&s;iderable army and fleet would
be nece&s;&s;ary for the reduction of Ireland, and the pro|tection
of Britain; and he de&s;ired they would &s;ettle the
revenue in &s;uch a manner, that it might be collected with|out
difficulty and di&s;pute. The &s;um total of the money
expended by the States-General in William's expedition,
amounted to &s;even millions of guilders, and the Commons
granted &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds for the di&s;charge of
this debt, incurred for the pre&s;ervation of their rights and
religion. They voted funds for rai&s;ing and maintaining
an army of two and twenty thou&s;and men, as well as for
equipping a numerous fleet: but, they provided for no
more than half a year's &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the troops, hoping
the reduction of Ireland might be fini&s;hed in that term;
and this in&s;tance of frugality the King con&s;idered as a
<PB N="14" REF="18">
mark of their diffidence of his admini&s;tration. The
Whigs were re&s;olved to &s;upply him gradually, that he
might be the more dependent upon their zeal and attach|ment:
but he was not at all plea&s;ed with their precaution.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. William was naturally bia&s;&s;ed to Calvini&s;m,
and aver&s;e to per&s;ecution. Whatever promi&s;es he had
made, and whatever &s;entiments of re&s;pect he entertained
for the church of England, he &s;eemed now in a great
mea&s;ure alienated from it, by the oppo&s;ition he had met
with from its members, particularly from the bi&s;hops, who
had thwarted his mea&s;ures. By ab&s;enting them&s;elves
from parliament, and refu&s;ing the oath, they had plainly
di&s;owned his title, and renounced his government. He
therefore re&s;olved to mortify the church, and gratify his
own friends at the &s;ame time, by removing the ob&s;tacles
affixed to nonconformity, that all prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters
&s;hould be rendered capable of enjoying and exerci&s;ing civil
employments. When he gave his a&s;&s;ent to the bill for
&s;u&s;pending the Habeas Corpus act, he recommended the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of a new oath in lieu of tho&s;e of allegiance
and &s;upremacy: he expre&s;&s;ed his hope that they would
leave room for the admi&s;&s;ion of all his prote&s;tant &s;ubjects
who &s;hould be found qualified for the &s;ervice: he &s;aid,
&s;uch a conjunction would unite them the more firmly
among them&s;elves, and &s;trengthen them again&s;t their com|mon
adver&s;aries. In con&s;equence of this hint, a clau&s;e
was in&s;erted in the bill for abrogating the old and ap|pointing
the new oaths, by which the &s;acramental te&s;t was
declared unnece&s;&s;ary in rendering any per&s;on capable of
enjoying any office or employment. It was, however,
rejected by a great majority in the Hou&s;e of Lords. Ano|ther
clau&s;e for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, though in different terms,
was propo&s;ed by the King's direction, and met with the
&s;ame fate, though in both ca&s;es &s;everal noblemen entered
a prote&s;t again&s;t the re&s;olution of the Hou&s;e. The&s;e fruit|le&s;s
efforts in favour of di&s;&s;enters augmented the prejudice
of the churchmen again&s;t King William, who would have
willingly compromi&s;ed the difference, by excu&s;ing the
<PB N="15" REF="19">
clergy from the oaths, provided the di&s;&s;enters might be
exempted from the &s;acramental te&s;t: but this was deemed
the chief bulwark of the church, and therefore the pro|po&s;al
was rejected. The church-party in the Hou&s;e of
Lords moved, that in&s;tead of in&s;erting a clau&s;e, obliging
the clergy to take the oaths, the king &s;hould be empowered
to tender them; and, in ca&s;e of their refu&s;al, they &s;hould
incur the penalty, becau&s;e deprivation, or the appre|hen&s;ions
of it, might make them de&s;perate, and excite
them to form de&s;igns again&s;t the government. This
argument had no weight with the Commons, who thought
it was indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to exact the oaths of the
clergy, as their example influenced the kingdom in
general, and the youth of the nation were formed under
their in&s;tructions. After a long and warm debate, all
the mitigation that could be obtained, was a clau&s;e em|powering
the king to indulge any twelve clergymen, de|prived
by virtue of this act, with a third part of their
benefices during plea&s;ure. Thus the ancient oaths of
allegiance and &s;upremacy were abrogated: the declaration
of non-re&s;i&s;tance in the act of uniformity was repealed:
the new oath of allegiance was reduced to its primitive
&s;implicity, and the coronation-oath rendered more explicit.
The clergy were enjoined to take the new oaths before
the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t, on pain of being &s;u&s;pended from
their office for &s;ix months, and of entire deprivation, in
ca&s;e they &s;hould not take them before the expiration of
this term. They generally complied, though with &s;uch
re&s;ervations and di&s;tinctions as were not much for the
honour of their &s;incerity.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. The King, though baffled in his de&s;ign again&s;t
the &s;acramental te&s;t, re&s;olved to indulge the di&s;&s;enters
with a toleration; and a bill for this purpo&s;e being pre|pared
by the Earl of Nottingham, was, after &s;ome debate,
pa&s;&s;ed into a law, under the title of, An act for exempt|ing
their Maje&s;ties prote&s;tant &s;ubjects di&s;&s;enting from the
church of England from the penalties of certain laws.
It enacted, That none of the penal laws &s;hould be con|&s;trued
<PB N="16" REF="20">
to extend to tho&s;e di&s;&s;enters who &s;hould take the
oaths to the pre&s;ent government, and &s;ub&s;cribe the decla|ration
of the thirtieth year of the reign of Charles II.
provided that they &s;hould hold no private a&s;&s;emblies or
conventicles with the doors &s;hut; that nothing &s;hould be
con&s;trued to exempt them from the payment of tithes, or
other parochial duties: That, in ca&s;e of being cho&s;en into
the offices of con&s;table, church-warden, over&s;eer, &amp;c. and
of &s;crupling to take the oaths annexed to &s;uch offices,
they &s;hould be allowed to execute the employment by
deputy: That the preachers and teachers in congregations
of di&s;&s;enting prote&s;tants, who &s;hould take the oaths,
&s;ub&s;cribe the declaration, together with all the articles of
religion, except the thirty-fourth and the two &s;ucceeding
articles, and part of the twentieth, &s;hould be exempted
from the penalties decreed again&s;t nonconformi&s;ts, as well
as from &s;erving upon juries, or acting in pari&s;h-offices:
yet all ju&s;tices of the peace were empowered to require
&s;uch di&s;&s;enters to &s;ub&s;cribe the declaration, and take the
oaths; and, in ca&s;e of refu&s;al, to commit them to pri&s;on,
without bail or mainprize. The &s;ame indulgence was
extended to anabapti&s;ts, and even to quakers, on their
&s;olemn promi&s;e, before God, to be faithful to the King
and Queen, and their a&s;&s;enting by profe&s;&s;ion and a&s;&s;evera|tion
to tho&s;e articles which the others ratified upon oath:
they were likewi&s;e required to profe&s;s their belief in the
Trinity and the Holy Scriptures. Even the papi&s;ts felt
the benign influence of William's moderation in &s;piritual
matters: he rejected the propo&s;als of &s;ome zealots, who
exhorted him to enact &s;evere laws again&s;t popi&s;h recu&s;ants.
Such a mea&s;ure, he ob&s;erved, would alienate all the
papi&s;ts of Europe from the intere&s;ts of England, and
might produce a new catholic league, which would render
the war a religious quarrel: be&s;ides, he could not pre|tend
to &s;creen the prote&s;tants of Germany and Hungary,
while he him&s;elf &s;hould per&s;ecute the catholics of Eng|land.
He therefore re&s;olved to treat them with lenity; and
<PB N="17" REF="21">
though they were not comprehended in the act, they
enjoyed the benefit of the toleration.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. We have ob&s;erved, that, in con&s;equence of the
motion made by the bi&s;hops when they withdrew from
parliament, a bill was brought into the Hou&s;e of Lords for
uniting their Maje&s;ties prote&s;tant &s;ubjects. This was ex|tremely
agreeable to the King, who had the &s;cheme of
comprehen&s;ion very much at heart. In the progre&s;s of
the bill a warm debate aro&s;e about the po&s;ture of kneel|ing
at the &s;acrament, which was given up in favour of
the di&s;&s;enters. Another, no le&s;s violent, en&s;ued upon
the &s;ub&s;equent que&s;tion, &startq;Whether there &s;hould be an
addition of laity in the commi&s;&s;ion to be given by the
King to the bi&s;hops and others of the clergy, for pre|paring
&s;uch a reformation of eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs as
might be the means of healing divi&s;ions, and correcting
whatever might be erroneous or defective in the con&s;ti|tution?&endq;
A great number of the temporal lords in&s;i&s;ted
warmly on this addition, and when it was rejected, four
peers entered a formal prote&s;t. Bi&s;hop Burnet was a warm
&s;tickler for the exclu&s;ion of the laity; and, in all proba|bility,
manife&s;ted this warmth in hopes of ingratiating
him&s;elf with his brethren, among whom his character was
very far from being popular. But the merit of this &s;acri|fice
was de&s;troyed by the arguments he had u&s;ed for
di&s;pen&s;ing with the po&s;ture of kneeling at the &s;acrament;
and by his propo&s;ing in another provi&s;o of the bill, that
the &s;ub&s;cribers, in&s;tead of expre&s;&s;ing a&s;&s;ent and con&s;ent,
&s;hould only &s;ubmit, with a promi&s;e of conformity.</P>
<P>&sect; X. The bill was with difficulty pa&s;&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of
Lords: but the Commons treated it with neglect. By this
time, a great number of malcontent members, who had
retired from parliament, were returned, with a view to
thwart the admini&s;tration, though they could not pre|vent
the &s;ettlement. In&s;tead of proceeding with the bill,
they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the King, thanking him for
his gracious declaration, and repeated a&s;&s;urances, that he
would maintain the church of England as by law e&s;ta|bli&s;hed;
<PB N="18" REF="22">
a church who&s;e doctrine and practice had evinced
its loyalty beyond all contradiction. They likewi&s;e
humbly be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty to i&s;&s;ue writs for calling a
convocation of the clergy, to be con&s;ulted in eccle&s;ia&s;tical
matters, according to the ancient u&s;age of parliaments;
and they declared they would forthwith take into con&s;i|deration
proper methods for giving ea&s;e to prote&s;tant
di&s;&s;enters. Though the King was di&s;plea&s;ed at this ad|dre&s;s,
in which the Lords al&s;o had concurred, he returned
a civil an&s;wer, by the mouth of the Earl of Nottingham,
profe&s;&s;ing his regard for the church of England, which
&s;hould always be his peculiar care, recommending the
di&s;&s;enters to their protection, and promi&s;ing to &s;ummon a
convocation as &s;oon as &s;uch a mea&s;ure &s;hould be conve|nient.
This method produced no effect in favour of the
bill, which lay neglected on the table. Tho&s;e who moved
for it had no other view than that of di&s;playing their mo|deration;
and now they excited their friends to oppo&s;e it
with all their intere&s;t. Others were afraid of e&s;pou&s;ing it,
le&s;t they &s;hould be &s;tigmatized as enemies to the church;
and a great number of the mo&s;t eminent pre&s;byterians
were aver&s;e to a &s;cheme of comprehen&s;ion, which di|mini&s;hed
their &s;trength, and weakened the importance of
the party. Being, therefore, violently oppo&s;ed on one
hand, and but faintly &s;upported on the other, no wonder
it mi&s;carried. The King, however, was &s;o bent upon
the execution of his de&s;ign, that it was next &s;e&s;&s;ion re|vived
in another form, though with no better &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. The next object that engro&s;&s;ed the attention of
the parliament, was the &s;ettlement of a revenue for the
&s;upport of the government. Hitherto there had been no
di&s;tinction of what was allotted for the King's u&s;e, and
what was a&s;&s;igned for the &s;ervice of the publick; &s;o that
the Sovereign was entirely ma&s;ter of the whole &s;upply. As
the revenue in the late reigns had been often embezzled
and mi&s;applied, it was now re&s;olved that a certain &s;um
&s;hould be &s;et apart for the maintenance of the King's
hou&s;ehold, and the &s;upport of his dignity; and that the re&s;t
<PB N="19" REF="23">
of the publick money &s;hould be employed under the in|&s;pection
of parliament. Accordingly, &s;ince this period,
the Commons have appropriated yearly &s;upplies to cer|tain
&s;pecified &s;ervices; and an account of the application
has been con&s;tantly &s;ubmitted to both Hou&s;es, at the next
&s;e&s;&s;ion. At this juncture$ the prevailing party, or the
Whigs, determined that the revenue &s;hould be granted
from year to year, or at lea&s;t for a &s;mall term of years,
that the King might find him&s;elf dependent upon the par|liament,
and merit a renewal of the grant by a ju&s;t and
popular admini&s;tration. In pur&s;uance of this maxim,
when the revenue fell under con&s;ideration, they, on pre|tence
of charges and anticipations which they had not
time to examine, granted it by a provi&s;ional act for one
year only. The civil li&s;t was &s;ettled at &s;ix hundred
thou&s;and pounds, chargeable with the appointments of the
Queen Dowager, the Prince and Prince&s;s of Denmark, the
judges, and Mare&s;chal Schomberg, to whom the parliament
had already granted one hundred thou&s;and pounds, in con|&s;ideration
of his important &s;ervices to the nation. The
Commons al&s;o voted, that a con&s;tant revenue of twelve
hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed for the
&s;upport of the crown in time of peace.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. The King took umbrage at the&s;e re&s;traints laid
upon the application of the publick money, which were
the mo&s;t &s;alutary fruits of the Revolution. He con&s;idered
them as marks of diffidence, by which he was di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
from his prede&s;&s;ors; and thought them an ungrateful
return for the &s;ervices he had done the nation. The
Tories perceived his di&s;gu&s;t, and did not fail to foment his
jealou&s;y again&s;t their adver&s;aries, which was confirmed by
a fre&s;h effort of the Whigs, in relation to a militia. A
bill was brought into the Hou&s;e, for regulating it in &s;uch a
manner as would have rendered it in a great mea&s;ure inde|pendent
both of the King and the lords lieutenants of
counties. The&s;e being generally peers, the bill was &s;uf|fered
to lie neglected on the table: but the attempt con|firmed
the &s;u&s;picion of the King, who began to think him|&s;elf
<PB N="20" REF="24">
in danger of being en&s;laved by a republican party.
The Tories had, by the canal of Nottingham, made
proffers of &s;ervice to his Maje&s;ty: but complained, at the
&s;ame time, that as they were in danger of being pro&s;ecuted
for their lives and fortunes, they could not, without an
act of indemnity, exert them&s;elves in favour of the crown,
le&s;t they &s;hould incur a per&s;ecution from their implacable
enemies.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. The&s;e remon&s;trances made &s;uch impre&s;&s;ion on
the King, that he &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e by Mr.
Hambden, recommending a bill of indemnity as the mo&s;t
effectual means for putting an end to all controver&s;ies,
di&s;tinctions, and occa&s;ions of di&s;cord. He de&s;ired it might
be prepared with all convenient expedition, and with &s;uch
exceptions only as &s;hould &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary for the vindi|cation
of publick ju&s;tice, the &s;afety of him and his con|&s;ort,
and the &s;ettlement and welfare of the nation. An
addre&s;s of thanks to his Maje&s;ty was unanimou&s;ly voted.
Neverthele&s;s, his de&s;ign was fru&s;trated by the backward|ne&s;s
of the Whigs, who proceeded &s;o &s;lowly in the bill,
that it could not be brought to maturity before the end of
the &s;e&s;&s;ion. They wanted to keep the &s;courge over the
heads of their enemies, until they &s;hould find a proper
opportunity for revenge; and, in the mean time, re&s;train
them from oppo&s;ition, by the terror of impending ven|geance.
They affected to in&s;inuate that the King's de&s;ign
was to rai&s;e the prerogative as high as it had been in the
preceding reigns; and that he for this purpo&s;e pre&s;&s;ed an
act of indemnity, by virtue of which he might legally u&s;e
the in&s;truments of the late tyranny. The Earls of Mon|mouth
and Warrington indu&s;triou&s;ly infu&s;ed the&s;e jealou|&s;ies
into the minds of their party: on the other hand, the
Earl of Nottingham inflamed William's di&s;tru&s;t of his old
friends: both &s;ides &s;ucceeded in kindling an animo&s;ity,
which had like to have produced confu&s;ion, notwith|&s;tanding
the endeavours u&s;ed by the Earls of Shrew&s;bury
and Devon&s;hire to allay tho&s;e heats, and remove the &s;u&s;|picion
that mutually prevailed.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="25">
&sect; XIV. It was now judged expedient to pa&s;s an act for
&s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown, according to the
former re&s;olution of the convention. A bill for this pur|po&s;e
was brought into the Lower Hou&s;e, with a clau&s;e di&s;|abling
papi&s;ts from &s;ucceeding to the throne: to this the
Lords added, &startq;Or &s;uch as &s;hould marry papi&s;ts,&endq; ab&s;olv|ing
the &s;ubject in that ca&s;e from allegiance. The Bi&s;hop
of Sali&s;bury, by the King's direction, propo&s;ed that the
Prince&s;s Sophia, Duche&s;s of Hanover, and her po&s;terity,
&s;hould be nominated in the act of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as the next
prote&s;tant heirs, failing i&s;&s;ue of the King, and Anne Prin|ce&s;s
of Denmark. The&s;e amendments gave ri&s;e to warm
debates in the Lower Hou&s;e, where they were vigorou&s;ly
oppo&s;ed, not only by tho&s;e who wi&s;hed well in &s;ecret to
the late King and the lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but likewi&s;e by
the republican party, who hoped to &s;ee monarchy alto|gether
extingui&s;hed in England, by the death of the three
per&s;ons already named in the bill of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The
Lords in&s;i&s;ted upon their amendments, and &s;everal fruitle&s;s
conferences were held between the two Hou&s;es. At length
the bill was dropped for the pre&s;ent, in con&s;equence of an
event which in a great mea&s;ure di&s;&s;ipated the fears of a
popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or. This was the delivery of the Prince&s;s
Anne, who, on the twenty-&s;eventh day of July, brought
forth a &s;on, chri&s;tened by the name of William, and after|wards
created Duke of Glouce&s;ter.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e dome&s;tick di&s;putes, William
did not neglect the affairs of the continent. He retained
all his former influence in Holland, as his countrymen
had rea&s;on to con&s;ide in his repeated a&s;&s;urances of invio|lable
affection. The great &s;cheme which he had pro|jected
of a confederacy again&s;t France began at this
period to take effect. The Princes of the empire a&s;|&s;embled
in the diet &s;olemnly exhorted the Emperor to
declare war again&s;t the French King, who had committed
numberle&s;s infractions of the treati&s;es of Mun&s;ter, O&s;na|bruck,
Nimeguen, and the truce, invaded their country
without provocation, and evinced him&s;elf an inveterate
<PB N="22" REF="26">
enemy of the holy Roman empire. They, therefore, be|&s;ought
his Imperial Maje&s;ty to conclude a treaty of peace
with the Turks, who had offered advantageous terms, and
proceed to an open rupture with Louis; in which ca&s;e, they
would con&s;ider it as a war of the empire, and &s;upport their
head in the mo&s;t effectual manner. The States-General
publi&s;hed a declaration again&s;t the common enemy, taxing
him with manifold infractions of the treaty of commerce;
with having involved the &s;ubjects of the Republick in the
per&s;ecution which he had rai&s;ed again&s;t the prote&s;tants;
with having cajoled and in&s;ulted them with deceitful pro|mi&s;es
and in&s;olent threats; with having plundered and
oppre&s;&s;ed the Dutch merchants and traders in France;
and, finally, with having declared war again&s;t the States,
without any plau&s;ible rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned. The Elector of
Brandenbourg denounced war again&s;t France, as a power
who&s;e perfidy, cruelty, and ambition it was the duty of
every prince to oppo&s;e. The Marquis de Ca&s;tanaga, go|vernor
of the Spani&s;h Netherlands, i&s;&s;ued a counter decla|ration
to that of Louis, who had declared again&s;t his
ma&s;ter. He accu&s;ed the French King of having laid wa&s;te
the empire, without any regard to the obligations of re|ligion
and humanity, or even to the laws of war; of
having countenanced the mo&s;t barbarous acts of cruelty
and oppre&s;&s;ion; and of having intrigued with the enemies
of Chri&s;t for the de&s;truction of the empire. The Emperor
negociated an alliance offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive with the
States-General, binding the contracting parties to co|operate
with their whole power again&s;t France and her
allies. It was &s;tipulated, that neither &s;ide &s;hould engage
in a &s;eparate treaty, on any pretence what&s;oever: that no
peace &s;hould be admitted, until the treaties of We&s;tphalia,
O&s;nabruck, Mun&s;ter, and the Pyrenecs, &s;hould have been
vindicated: that, in ca&s;e of a negociation for a peace or
truce, the tran&s;actions on both &s;ides &s;hould be communi|cated
<HI>bona fide;</HI> and that Spain and England &s;hould be
invited to accede to the treaty. In a &s;eparate article, the
contracting powers agreed, that, in ca&s;e of the Spani&s;h
<PB N="23" REF="27">
King's dying without i&s;&s;ue, the States-General &s;hould
a&s;&s;i&s;t the Emperor with all their forces to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of that monarchy: That they &s;hould u&s;e their friendly
endeavours with the Princes Electors, their allies, towards
elevating his &s;on Jo&s;eph to the dignity of King of the Ro|mans;
and employ their utmo&s;t force again&s;t France,
&s;hould &s;he attempt to oppo&s;e his elevation.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. William, who was the &s;oul of this confede|racy,
found no difficulty in per&s;uading the Engli&s;h to un|dertake
a war again&s;t their old enemies and rivals. On
the &s;ixteenth day of April Mr. Hambden made a motion
for taking into con&s;ideration the &s;tate of the kingdom with
re&s;pect to France, and foreign alliances; and the Com|mons
unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, that, in ca&s;e his Maje&s;ty
&s;hould think fit to engage in a war with France, they
would, in a parliamentary way, enable him to carry it on
with vigour. An addre&s;s was immediately drawn up, and
pre&s;ented to the King, de&s;iring he would &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider
the de&s;tructive methods taken of late years by the French
King again&s;t the trade, quiet, and intere&s;t of the nation,
particularly his pre&s;ent inva&s;ion of Ireland, and &s;upport|ing
the rebels in that kingdom. They did not doubt but
the alliances already made, and tho&s;e that might hereafter
be concluded by his Maje&s;ty, would be &s;ufficient to reduce
the French King to &s;uch a condition, that it &s;hould not
be in his power to violate the peace of Chri&s;tendom; nor
prejudice the trade and pro&s;perity of England: in the
mean time they a&s;&s;ured his Maje&s;ty he might depend upon
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Parliament, according to the vote
which had pa&s;&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Commons. This was a
welcome addre&s;s to King William. He a&s;&s;ured them that
no part of the &s;upplies which they might grant for the pro|&s;ecution
of the war &s;hould be mi&s;applied; and, on the
&s;eventh day of May, he declared war again&s;t the French
Monarch. On this occa&s;ion Louis was charged with
having ambitiou&s;ly invaded the territories of the Emperor,
and denounced war again&s;t the allies of England, in vio|lation
of the treaties confirmed under the guaranty of
<PB N="24" REF="28">
the Engli&s;h crown; with having encroached upon the
fi&s;hery of Newfoundland, invaded the Caribbee i&s;lands,
taken forcible po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of New-York and Hud&s;on's-bay,
made depredations on the Engli&s;h at &s;ea, prohibited the
importation of Engli&s;h manufactures, di&s;puted the right
of the flag, per&s;ecuted many Engli&s;h &s;ubjects on account
of religion, contrary to expre&s;s treaties and the law of
nations, and &s;ent an armament to Ireland, in &s;upport of
the rebels of that kingdom.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. Having thus de&s;cribed the progre&s;s of the Re|volution
in England, we &s;hall now briefly explain the
mea&s;ures that were pro&s;ecuted in Scotland, towards the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of William on the throne of that kingdom.
The meeting of the Scotti&s;h convention was fixed for the
fourteenth day of March; and both parties employed all
their intere&s;t to influence the election of members. The
Duke of Hamilton, and all the pre&s;byterians, declared for
William. The Duke of Gordon maintained the ca&s;tle of
Edinburgh for his old ma&s;ter: but, as he had neglected
to lay in a &s;tore of provi&s;ions, he depended entirely upon
the citizens for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. The parti&s;ans of James were
headed by the Earl of Balcarras, and Graham Vi&s;count
Dundee, who employed their endeavours to pre&s;erve union
among the individuals of their party; to confirm the Duke
of Gordon, who began to waver in his attachment to their
&s;overeign; and to manage their intrigues in &s;uch a man|ner
as to derive &s;ome advantage to their cau&s;e from the
tran&s;actions of the en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ion. When the Lords and
Commons a&s;&s;embled at Edinburgh, the Bi&s;hop of that dio|ce&s;e,
who officiated as chaplain to the convention, prayed
for the re&s;toration of King James. The fir&s;t di&s;pute
turned upon the choice of a pre&s;ident. The friends of the
late King &s;et up the Marquis of Athol in oppo&s;ition to the
Duke of Hamilton; but this la&s;t was elected by a con&s;ide|rable
majority; and a good number of the other party,
finding their cau&s;e the weake&s;t, de&s;erted it from that mo|ment.
The Earls of Lothian and Tweedale were &s;ent as
deputies, to require the Duke of Gordon, in the name of
<PB N="25" REF="29">
the e&s;tates, to quit the ca&s;tle in four and twenty hours,
and leave the charge of it to the prote&s;tant officer next in
command. The Duke, though in him&s;elf irre&s;olute, was
animated by Dundee to demand &s;uch conditions as the
convention would not grant. The negociation proving
ineffectual, the States ordered the heralds, in all their for|malities,
to &s;ummon him to &s;urrender the ca&s;tle immedi|ately,
on pain of incurring the penalties of high trea&s;on;
and he refu&s;ing to obey their mandate, was proclaimed a
traitor. All per&s;ons were forbid, under the &s;ame penalties,
to aid, &s;uccour, or corre&s;pond with him; and the ca&s;tle
was blocked up by the troops of the city.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. Next day an expre&s;s arrived from London,
with a letter from King William to the e&s;tates; and, at
the &s;ame time, another from James was pre&s;ented by one
Crane, an Engli&s;h dome&s;tick of the abdicated Queen.
William ob&s;erved that he had called a meeting of their
e&s;tates, at the de&s;ire of the nobility and gentry of Scotland
a&s;&s;embled at London, who reque&s;ted that he would take
upon him&s;elf the admini&s;tration of their affairs. He ex|horted
them to concert mea&s;ures for &s;ettling the peace of
the kingdom upon a &s;olid foundation; and to lay a&s;ide
animo&s;ities and factions, which &s;erved only to impede that
&s;alutary &s;ettlement. He profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;en&s;ible of the
good effects that would ari&s;e from an union of the two
kingdoms; and a&s;&s;ured them he would u&s;e his be&s;t en|deavours
to promote &s;uch a coalition. A committee being
appointed to draw up a re&s;pectful an&s;wer to the&s;e a&s;&s;ur|ances,
a debate en&s;ued about the letter from the late King
James. This they re&s;olved to favour with a reading,
after the members &s;hould have &s;ub&s;cribed an act, declaring,
that notwith&s;tanding any thing that might be con|tained
in the letter for di&s;&s;olving the convention, or
$mpeding their procedure, they were a free and law|ful
meeting of the &s;tates; and would continue undi&s;&s;olved,
until they &s;hould have &s;ettled and &s;ecured the prote&s;tant
religion, the government, laws, and liberties of the king|dom.
Having taken this precaution, they proceeded to
<PB N="26" REF="30">
examine the letter of their late Sovereign, who conjured&punc;
them to &s;upport his intere&s;t as faithful &s;ubjects, and eter|nize
their names by a loyalty &s;uitable to their former pro|fe&s;&s;ions.
He &s;aid he would not fail to give them &s;uch
&s;peedy and powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance as would enable them to
defend them&s;elves from any foreign attempt; and even to
a&s;&s;ert his right again&s;t tho&s;e enemies who had depre&s;&s;ed it
by the blacke&s;t u&s;urpations and unnatural attempts, which
the Almighty God would not allow to pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed.
He offered pardon to all tho&s;e who &s;hould return to their
duty before the la&s;t day of the month; and threatened to
puni&s;h rigorou&s;ly &s;uch as &s;hould &s;tand out in rebellion
again&s;t him and his authority.</P>
<P>XIX. This addre&s;s produced very little effect i$
favour of the unfortunate exile, who&s;e friends were greatly
outnumbered in this a&s;&s;embly. His me&s;&s;enger was ordered
into cu&s;tody, and afterwards di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a pa&s;s in&s;tead
of an an&s;wer. James, fore&s;eeing this contempt, had, by
an in&s;trument dated in Ireland, authori&s;ed the Archbi&s;hop
of Gla&s;gow, the Earl of Balcarras, and the Vi&s;count Dun|dee,
to call a convention of the e&s;tates at Stirling. The&s;e
three depended on the intere&s;t of the Marquis of Atho$
and the Earl of Mar, who profe&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t affection$
for the late King; and they hoped a &s;ece&s;&s;ion of their
friends would embarra&s;s the convention, &s;o as to retard the
&s;ettlement of King William. Their expectations, how|ever,
were di&s;appointed. Athol de&s;erted their cau&s;e; an$
Mar &s;uffered him&s;elf to be intercepted in his retreat. The$
re&s;t of their party were, by the vigilance of the Duke o$
Hamilton, prevented from leaving the convention, excep$
the Vi&s;count Dundee, who retreated to the mountains
with about fifty hor&s;e, and was pur&s;ued by order of th$
e&s;tates. This de&s;ign being fru&s;trated, the convention ap|proved
and recogni&s;ed, by a &s;olemn act, the conduct $word$
the nobility and gentlemen who had intreated the King $word$
England to take upon him the admini&s;tration. The$$
acknowledged their obligation to the Prince of Orange$
who had prevented the de&s;truction of their laws, religion$
<PB N="27" REF="31">
and fundamental con&s;titution: they be&s;ought his Highne&s;s
$o a&s;&s;ume the reins of government for that kingdom: they
$&s;&s;ued a proclamation, requiring all per&s;ons, from &s;ixteen
$o &s;ixty, to be in readine&s;s to take arms when called upon
for that purpo&s;e: they conferred the command of their
hor&s;e-militia upon Sir Patrick Hume, who was formerly
attainted for having been concerned in Argyle's in&s;ur|rection:
they levied eight hundred men for a guard to the
city of Edinburgh, and con&s;tituted the Earl of Leven their
commander: they put the militia all over the kingdom
into the hands of tho&s;e on whom they could rely: they
created the Earl of Mar governor of Stirling ca&s;tle: they
received a re-enforcement of five regiments from England,
under the command of Mackay, whom they appointed
their general; and they i&s;&s;ued orders for &s;ecuring all di&s;|affected
per&s;ons. Then they di&s;patched Lord Ro&s;s, with
an an&s;wer to King William's letter, profe&s;&s;ing their
gratitude to their deliverer, and congratulating him upon
his &s;ucce&s;s. They thanked him for a&s;&s;uming the admi|ni&s;tration
of their affairs, and a&s;&s;embling a convention of
their e&s;tates. They declared they would take effectual
and &s;peedy mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring the prote&s;tant religion, as
well as for e&s;tabli&s;hing the government, laws, and liberties
of the kingdom. They a&s;&s;ured him they would, as much
as lay in their power, avoid di&s;putes and animo&s;ities; and
de&s;ired the continuance of his Maje&s;ty's care and pro|tection.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. After the departure of Lord Ro&s;s, they ap|pointed
a committee, con&s;i&s;ting of eight lords, eight
knights, and as many burge&s;&s;es, to prepare the plan of a
new &s;ettlement: but this re&s;olution was not taken with|out
a vigorous oppo&s;ition from &s;ome remaining adherents
of the late King, headed by the Archbi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow,
all the other prelates, except he of Edinburgh, having
already de&s;erted the convention. After warm debates,
the committee agreed in the following vote: &startq;The
e&s;tates of the kingdom of Scotland find and declare,
That King James VII. being a profe&s;&s;ed papi&s;t, did
<PB N="28" REF="32">
a&s;&s;ume the royal power, and act as a king, without
ever taking the oath required by law; and had, by the
advice of evil and wicked coun&s;ellors, invaded the
fundamental con&s;titution of this kingdom, and altered
it from a legal and limited monarchy to an arbitrary
de&s;potick power, and had governed the &s;ame to the
&s;ubver&s;ion of the prote&s;tant religion, and violation o$
the laws and liberties of the nation, inverting all the
ends of government; whereby he had forfeited the right
of the crown, and the throne was become vacant.&endq;
When this vote was reported, the Bi&s;hop of Edinburgh
argued &s;trenuou&s;ly again&s;t it, as containing a charge of
which the King was innocent; and he propo&s;ed that his
Maje&s;ty &s;hould be invited to return to his Scotti&s;h domi|nions.
All his arguments were defeated or over-ruled,
and the Hou&s;e confirmed the vote, which was immediately
enacted into a law by a great majority. The Lord Pre&s;i|dent
declared the throne vacant, and propo&s;ed that it
might be filled with William and Mary, King and Queen
of England. The committee was ordered to prepare an
act for &s;ettling the crown upon their Maje&s;ties, together
with an in&s;trument of government for &s;ecuring the &s;ubjects
from the grievances under which they laboured.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. On the eleventh day of April, this act, with
the conditions of inheritance, and the in&s;trument, were
reported, con&s;idered, unanimou&s;ly approved, and &s;olemnly
proclaimed at the market-cro&s;s of Edinburgh, in pre&s;ence
of the Lord Pre&s;ident, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Lord Provo&s;t and
magi&s;tracy of the city, the Duke of Queen&s;berry, the
Marqui&s;&s;es of Athol and Douglas, together with a great
number of the nobility and gentry. At the &s;ame time they
publi&s;hed another proclamation, forbidding all per&s;ons to
acknowledge, obey, a&s;&s;i&s;t, or corre&s;pond with the late&punc;
King James; or, by word, writing, or &s;ermon, to di&s;pute
or di&s;own the royal authority of King William and Queen
Mary; or to mi&s;con&s;true the proceedings of the e&s;tates,
or create jealou&s;ies or mi&s;apprehen&s;ions with regard to the
tran&s;actions of the government, on pain of incurring the
<PB N="29" REF="33">
mo&s;t &s;evere penalties. Then, having &s;ettled the corona|tion-oath,
they granted a commi&s;&s;ion to the Earl of
Argyle for the Lords, to Sir James Montgomery for the
Knights, and to Sir John Dalrymple for the Boroughs,
$mpowering them to repair to London, and inve&s;t their
Maje&s;ties with the government. This affair being di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed,
the convention appointed a committee to take care
of the publick peace, and adjourned to the twenty-fir&s;t
day of May. On the eleventh day of that month, the
Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners being introduced to their Maje&s;ties
at Whitehall, pre&s;ented fir&s;t a preparatory letter from the
e&s;tates, then the in&s;trument of government, with a paper
containing a recital of the grievances of the nation; and
an addre&s;s, de&s;iring his Maje&s;ty to convert the convention
into a parliament. The King having graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed
to concur with them in all ju&s;t mea&s;ures for the intere&s;t of
the kingdom, the coronation-oath was tendered to their
Maje&s;ties by the Earl of Argyle. As it contained a
clau&s;e, importing, that they &s;hould root out here&s;y, the
King declared, that he did not mean by the&s;e words, that
he &s;hould be under an obligation to act as a per&s;ecutor:
the commi&s;&s;ioners replying, that &s;uch was not the mean|ing
or import of the oath, he de&s;ired them, and others
pre&s;ent, to bear witne&s;s to the exception he had made.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. In the mean time, Lord Dundee exerted him|&s;elf
with uncommon activity in behalf of his ma&s;ter. He
had been &s;ummoned by a trumpet to return to the conven|tion,
but refu&s;ed to obey the citation, on pretence that
the Whigs had made an attempt upon his life; and that
the deliberations of the e&s;tates were influenced by the
neighbourhood of Engli&s;h troops, under the command of
Mackay. He was forthwith declared a fugitive, outlaw,
and rebel. He was rancorou&s;ly hated by the pre&s;byterians,
on whom he had exerci&s;ed &s;ome cruelties, as an officer
under the former government; and for this rea&s;on the
States re&s;olved to inflict upon him exemplary puni&s;hment.
Parties were detached in pur&s;uit of him and Balcarras.
This la&s;t fell into their hands, and was committed to a
<PB N="30" REF="34">
common pri&s;on; but Dundee fought his way through the
troops that &s;urrounded him, and e&s;caped to the Highlands,
where he determined to take arms in favour of James,
though that prince had forbid him to make any attempt of
this nature, until he &s;hould receive a re-enforcement from
Ireland. While this officer was employed in a&s;&s;embling
the clans of this party, King William appointed the Duke
of Hamilton commi&s;&s;ioner to the convention parliament.
The po&s;t of &s;ecretary for Scotland was be&s;towed upon
Lord Melvil, a weak and &s;ervile nobleman, who had taken
refuge in Holland from the violences of the late reigns:
but the King depended chiefly for advice upon Dalrymple,
Lord Stair, Pre&s;ident of the College of Ju&s;tice, an old
crafty fanatick, who for fifty years had complied in all
things with all governments. Though the&s;e were rigid
pre&s;byterians, the King, to humour the oppo&s;ite party, ad|mitted
&s;ome individuals of the epi&s;copal nobility to the
Council-Board; and this intermixture, in&s;tead of allaying
animo&s;ities, &s;erved only to &s;ow the &s;eeds of di&s;cord and confu|&s;ion.
The Scotti&s;h convention, in their detail of grievances,
enumerated the lords of the articles; the act of parliament
in the reign of Charles II. by which the King's &s;upremacy
was rai&s;ed &s;o high that he could pre&s;cribe any mode of reli|gion
according to his plea&s;ure; and the &s;uperiority of any
office in the church above that of pre&s;byters. The King,
in his in&s;tructions to the Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner, con&s;ented
to a regulation of the lords of the articles, though he
would not allow the in&s;titution to be abrogated; he was
contented that the act relating to the King's &s;upremacy
&s;hould be re&s;cinded, and that the church-government
&s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;uch a manner as would be mo&s;t
agreeable to the inclination of the people.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. On the &s;eventeenth day of June Duke Ha|milton
opened the Scotti&s;h parliament, after the conven|tion
had a&s;&s;umed this name, in con&s;equence of an act
pa&s;&s;ed by his Maje&s;ty's direction; but the members in
general were extremely chagrined when they found the
commi&s;&s;ioners &s;o much re&s;tricted in the affair of the lords
<PB N="31" REF="35">
of the articles, which they con&s;idered as their chief
grievance<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The lords of the articles, by the gradual u&s;urpartion of the crown, $$$ually con&s;tituted a grievance intolerable in a free nation. The King $word$ powered the commi&s;&s;ioner to choo&s;e eight bi&s;hops, whom he authori&s;ed $word$ nominate eight noblemen: the&s;e together cho&s;e eight barons, and eight $$rge&s;&s;es; and this whole number, in conjunction with the officers of &s;tate $word$ &s;upernumeraries, con&s;tituted the lords of the articles. This committee $&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ole exclu&s;ive right and liberty of bringing in motions, making $ertures for redre&s;&s;ing wrongs, and propo&s;ing means and expedients for $word$ relief, &s;afety, and benefit of the &s;ubjects.&mdash;<HI>Proceedings of the Scots Parlia|$$nt vindicated.</HI></NOTE>. The King permitted that the E&s;tates &s;hould
choo&s;e the lords by their own &s;uffrages; and that they
&s;hould be at liberty to recon&s;ider any &s;ubject which the
&s;aid lords might reject. He afterwards indulged the three
e&s;tates with the choice of eleven delegates each, for this
committee, to be elected monthly, or oftener, if they
&s;hould think fit: but even the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions proved un&s;a|tisfactory,
while the in&s;titution it&s;elf remained. Their
di&s;contents were not even appea&s;ed by the pa&s;&s;ing of an
act, aboli&s;hing prelacy. Indeed their re&s;entment was in|flamed
by another con&s;ideration; namely, that of the
King's having given &s;eats in the council to &s;ome indivi|duals
attached to the hierarchy. They manife&s;ted their
&s;entiments on this &s;ubject by bringing in a bill, excluding
from any public tru&s;t, place, or employment under their
Maje&s;ties all &s;uch as had been concerned in the encroach|ments
of the late reign, or had di&s;covered di&s;affection to
the late happy change, or in any way retarded or ob|&s;tructed
the de&s;igns of the convention. This mea&s;ure
was pro&s;ecuted with great warmth; and the bill pa&s;&s;ed
through all the forms of the Hou&s;e, but proved ineffec|tual,
for want of the royal a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. Nor were they le&s;s ob&s;tinate in the affair of
the judges, whom the King had ventured to appoint by
virtue of his own prerogative. The malcontents brought
in a bill declaring the bench vacant, as it was at the
re&s;toration; a&s;&s;erting their own right to examine and ap|prove
tho&s;e who &s;hould be appointed to fill it; providing
<PB N="32" REF="36">
that if in the time to come any &s;uch total vacancy &s;houl$
occur, the nomination &s;hould be in the King or Queen
or regent for the time being, and the parliament retai$
the right of approbation; and that all the clau&s;es in th$
&s;everal acts relating to the admi&s;&s;ion of the ordinary lor$
of &s;e&s;&s;ion, and their qualifications for that office, &s;houl$
be ratified and confirmed for perpetual ob&s;ervation$ Suc$
was the intere&s;t of this party, that the bill was carried by $
great majority, notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition of th$
mini&s;ters, who re&s;olved to maintain the King's nomina|tion,
even in defianceof a parliamentary re&s;olution. Th$
majority, exa&s;perated at this open violation of their pr$|vileges,
forbad the judges whom the King had appointe$
to open their commi&s;&s;ions or hold a &s;e&s;&s;ion until his Ma|je&s;ty's
further plea&s;ure &s;hould be known: on the other han$
they were compelled to act by the menaces of the privy
council. The di&s;pute was carried on with great acrimon$
on both &s;ides, and produced &s;uch a ferment, that before th$
&s;e&s;&s;ion opened the mini&s;try thought proper to draw a grea$
number of forces into the neighbourhood of Edinburg$
to &s;upport the judges in the exerci&s;e of their functions.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. The Lord Commi&s;&s;ioner, alarmed at th$
&s;cene of tumult and confu&s;ion, adjourned the hou&s;e $word$
the eighth day of October; a &s;tep which, added to th$
other unpopular mea&s;ures of the court, incen&s;ed the oppo|&s;ition
to a violent degree. They drew up a remon&s;tranc$
to the King, complaining of this adjournment while th$
nation was yet un&s;ettled, recapitulating the &s;everal in|&s;tances
in which they had expre&s;&s;ed their zeal and affectio$
for his Maje&s;ty; explaining their rea&s;ons for di&s;&s;entin$
from the Mini&s;try in &s;ome articles; be&s;eeching him $word$
con&s;ider what they had repre&s;ented, to give his royal a&s;&s;e$$
to the acts of parliament which they had prepared, an$
take mea&s;ures for redre&s;&s;ing all the other grievances of th$
nation. This addre&s;s was pre&s;ented to the King $word$
Hampton-court. William was &s;o touched with the re|proaches
it implied, as if he had not fulfilled the condition
on which he accepted the crown of Scotland, that he, $word$
<PB N="33" REF="37">
his own vindication, publi&s;hed his in&s;tructions to the
commi&s;&s;ioner; and by the&s;e it appeared, that the Duke
might have proceeded to greater lengths in obliging his
countrymen. Before the adjournment, however, the
parliament had granted the revenue for life; and rai&s;ed
money for maintaining a body of forces, as well as for
&s;upporting the incidental expen&s;e of the government for
&s;ome months: yet part of the troops in that kingdom
were &s;upplied and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by the admini&s;tration of Eng|land.
In con&s;equence of the&s;e di&s;putes in the Scotti&s;h
parliament, their church was left without any &s;ettled form
of government; for, though the hierarchy was aboli&s;hed,
the pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline was not yet e&s;tabli&s;hed, and
eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs were occa&s;ionally regulated by the
privy-council, deriving its authority from that very act of
&s;upremacy, which, according to the claim of rights,
ought to have been repealed.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. The &s;e&s;&s;ion was no &s;ooner adjourned than
Sir John Lanier converted the blockade of Edinburgh|ca&s;tle
into a regular &s;iege, which was pro&s;ecuted with
&s;uch vigour, that in a little time the fortifications were
ruined, and the works advanced to the foot of the walls,
in which the be&s;iegers had made &s;everal large breaches.
The Duke of Gordon, finding his ammunition expended,
his defen&s;es de&s;troyed, his intelligence entirely cut off,
and de&s;pairing of relief from the adherents of his ma&s;ter,
de&s;ired to capitulate, and obtained very favourable terms
for his garri&s;on; but he would not &s;tipulate any conditions
for him&s;elf, declaring, that he had &s;o much re&s;pect for
all the princes de&s;cended from King James VI. that he
would not affront any of them &s;o far as to in&s;i&s;t upon
terms for his own particular: he, therefore, on the
thirteenth day of June, &s;urrendered the ca&s;tle and him&s;elf
at di&s;cretion. All the hopes of James and his party were
now concentred in the Vi&s;count Dundee, who had
a&s;&s;embled a body of Highlanders, and re&s;olved to attack
Mackay, on an a&s;&s;urance he had received by me&s;&s;age,
that the regiment of Scotti&s;h dragoons would de&s;ert that
<PB N="34" REF="38">
officer, and join him in the action. Mackay, having re|ceived
intimation of this de&s;ign, decamped immediately,
and by long marches retired before Dundee, until he was
re-enforced by Ram&s;ey's dragoons, and another regiment
of Engli&s;h in&s;antry: then he faced about, and Dundee in
his turn retreated into Lochabar. Lord Murray, &s;on of
the Marquis of Athol, a&s;&s;embled his va&s;&s;als to the number
of twelve hundred men for the &s;ervice of the regency;
but he was betrayed by one of his own dependants, who
&s;ei&s;ed the ca&s;tle of Blair for Dundee, and prevailed upon
the A$hol men to di&s;per&s;e, rather than fight again&s;t James
their lawful &s;overeign.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. The Vi&s;count was by this time reduced to
great difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s. His men had not for many
weeks ta&s;ted bread or &s;alt, or any drink but water: in&s;tead
of five hundred infantry, three hundred hor&s;e, with a
&s;upply of arms, ammunition, and provi&s;ion, which James
had promi&s;ed to &s;end from Ireland, he received a re|enforcement
of three hundred naked recruits; but the
tran&s;ports with the &s;tores fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h.
Though this was a mortifying di&s;appointment he bore it
without repining; and, far from abandoning him&s;elf to
de&s;pair, began his march to the ca&s;tle of Blair, which was
threatened with a &s;iege by General Mackay. When he
reached this fortre&s;s, he received intelligence that the
enemy had entered the pa&s;s of Killycrankie, and he re|&s;olved
to give them battle without delay. He accord|ingly
advanced again&s;t them, and a furious engagement
en&s;ued, though it was not of long duration. The High|landers
having received and returned the fire of the
Engli&s;h, fell in among them &s;word in hand with &s;uch im|petuo&s;ity,
that the foot were utterly broke in &s;even minutes.
The dragoons $led at the fir&s;t charge in the utmo&s;t con|&s;ternation:
Dundee's hor&s;e, not exceeding one hundred,
broke through Mackay's own regiment: the Earl of
Dumbarton, at the head of a few volunteers made him|&s;elf
ma&s;ter of the artillery: twelve hundred of Mackay's
forces were killed on the &s;pot, five hundred taken pri|&s;oners,
<PB N="35" REF="39">
and the re&s;t fled with great precipitation for &s;ome
hours, until they were rallied by their general, who was
an officer of approved courage, conduct, and experience.
Nothing could be more complete or deci&s;ive than the
victory which the Highlanders obtained; yet it was dearly
purcha&s;ed with the death of their beloved chieftain the
Vi&s;count Dundee, who fell by a random-&s;hot in the
engagement, and his fate produced &s;uch confu&s;ion in his
army as prevented all pur&s;uit. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an enterpri&s;ing
&s;pirit, undaunted courage, inviolable fidelity, and was
peculiarly qualified to command the people who fought
under his banner. He was the life and &s;oul of that cau&s;e
which he e&s;pou&s;ed, and after his death it daily declined
into ruin and di&s;grace. He was &s;ucceeded in command by
Colonel Cannon, who landed the re-enforcement from
Ireland; but all his de&s;igns mi&s;carried: &s;o that the clans,
wearied with repeated misfortunes, laid down their arms
by degrees, and took the benefit of a pardon, which King
William offered to tho&s;e who &s;hould &s;ubmit within the
time &s;pecified in his proclamation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. After this &s;ketch of Scotti&s;h affairs, it will
be nece&s;&s;ary to take a retro&s;pective view of James, and
relate the particulars of his expedition to Ireland. That
unfortunate Prince and his Queen were received with the
mo&s;t cordial ho&s;pitality by the French monarch, who
a&s;&s;igned the ca&s;tle of St. Germain for the place of their
re&s;idence, &s;upported their hou&s;ehold with great magnifi|cence,
enriched them with pre&s;ents, and undertook to
re-e&s;tabli&s;h them on the throne of England. James,
however, conducted him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner as con|veyed
no favourable idea of his &s;pirit and under&s;tanding.
He &s;eems to have been ema&s;culated by religion: he was
de&s;erted by that courage and magnanimity for which his
youth had been di&s;tingui&s;hed. He did not di&s;cover great
&s;en&s;ibility at the lo&s;s of his kingdom. All his faculties
were &s;wallowed up in bigotry. In&s;tead of contriving
plans for retrieving his crown, he held conferences with
the je&s;uits on topicks of religion. The pity which his
<PB N="36" REF="40">
misfortunes excited in Louis was mingled with contempt.
The Pope &s;upplied him with indulgences, while the
Romans laughed at him in pa&s;quinades; &startq;There is a pious
man (&s;aid the Archbi&s;hop of Rheims ironically)
who has &s;acrificed three crowns for a ma&s;s.&endq; In a word,
he &s;ubjected him&s;elf to the ridicule and raillery of the
French nation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. All the hope of rea&s;cending the Briti&s;h throne
depended upon his friends in Scotland and Ireland.
Tyrconnel, who commanded in this la&s;t kingdom, was
confirmed in his attachment to James, by the per&s;ua&s;ions
of Hamilton, who had undertaken for his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to
the Prince of Orange. Neverthele&s;s, he di&s;gui&s;ed his
&s;entiments, and tempori&s;ed with William, until James
&s;hould be able to &s;upply him with re-enforcements from
France, which he earne&s;tly &s;ollicited by private me&s;&s;ages.
In the mean time, with a view to cajole the prote&s;tants of
Ireland, and amu&s;e King William with hope of his &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion,
he per&s;uaded the Lord Mountjoy, in whom the
prote&s;tants chiefly con&s;ided, and Baron Rice, to go in
per&s;on with a commi&s;&s;ion to James, repre&s;enting the
nece&s;&s;ity of yielding to the times, and of waiting a fitter
opportunity to make u&s;e of his Iri&s;h &s;ubjects. Mountjoy,
on his arrival at Paris, in&s;tead of being favoured with an
audience by James, to explain the rea&s;ons which Tyr|connel
had &s;ugge&s;ted touching the inability of Ireland to
re&s;tore his Maje&s;ty, was committed pri&s;oner to the Ba&s;tile,
on account of the zeal with which he had e&s;pou&s;ed the
prote&s;tant intere&s;t. Although Louis was &s;incerely di&s;|po&s;ed
to a&s;&s;i&s;t James effectually, his intentions were
ob&s;tructed by the di&s;putes of his mini&s;try. Louvois
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the chief credit in council; but, Seignelai en|joyed
a greater &s;hare of per&s;onal favour, both with the
King and Madame de Maintenon, the favourite concubine.
To this nobleman, as &s;ecretary for marine affairs, James
made his chief application; and he had promi&s;ed the com|mand
of the troops de&s;tined for his &s;ervice to Lau&s;un,
whom Louvois hated. For the&s;e rea&s;ons this mini&s;ter
<PB N="37" REF="41">
thwarted his mea&s;ures, and retarded the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which
Louis had promi&s;ed towards his re&s;toration.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. Yet, notwith&s;tanding all his oppo&s;ition, the
&s;uccours were prepared, and the fleet ready to put to &s;ea
by the latter end of February. The French King is &s;aid
to have offered an army of fifteen thou&s;and natives of
France to &s;erve in this expedition: but James replied,
that he would &s;ucceed by the help of his own &s;ubjects, or
peri&s;h in the attempt. Accordingly, he contented him&s;elf
with about twelve hundred Briti&s;h &s;ubjects<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">James in this expedition was attended by the Duke of Berwick, and by his brother, Mr. Fitzjames grand prior, the Duke of Powis, the Earls of Dover, Melfort, Abercorn, and Seaforth; the Lords Henry and Thomas Howard, the Lords Drummond, Dungan, Trendraught, Buchan, Hun&s;don, and Brittas; the Bi&s;hops of Che&s;ter and Ga$way, the late Lord-Chief-Ju&s;tice Herbert; the Marquis D'E&s;trades, M. de Ro&s;ene, mare&s;chal de camp; Mamoe, Pu|&s;ignan, and Lori Lieutenant-Generals, Prontee Engineer-General; the Marquis d'Albeville, Sir John Sparrow, Sir Roger Strickland, Sir William Jennings, Sir Henry Bond, Sir Charles Carney, Sir Edward Vaudrey, Sir Charles Murray, Sir Robert Parker, Sir Alphon&s;o Maiolo, Sir Samuel Foxon, and Sir William Wallis; by the Colonels Porter, Sarsfield, Anthony and John Hamilton, Simon and Henry Luttrel, Ram&s;ay, Dorrington, Sutherland, Clifford, Parker, Purcel, Cannon, and Fielding, with about two-and-twenty other officers of inferior rank.</NOTE>, and a good
number of French officers, who were embarked in the
fleet at Bre&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of fourteen &s;hips of the line,
&s;even frigates, three fire&s;hips, with a good number of
tran&s;ports. The French King al&s;o &s;upplied him with a
con&s;iderable quantity of arms for the u&s;e of his adherents
in Ireland; accommodated him with a large &s;um of money,
&s;uperb equipages, &s;tore of plate, and nece&s;&s;aries of all
kinds for the camp and the hou&s;ehold. At parting, he
pre&s;ented him with his own cuira&s;s, and embracing him
affectionately, &startq;The be&s;t thing I can wi&s;h you (&s;aid he)
is that I may never &s;ee you again.&endq; On the &s;eventh
day of March James embarked at Bre&s;t, together with the
Count D'Avaux, who accompanied him in quality of
amba&s;&s;ador, and his principal officers. He was detained
in the harbour by contrary winds till the &s;eventeenth day
of the month, when he &s;et &s;ail, and on the twenty-&s;econd
landed at Kin&s;ale in Ireland. By this time, King William,
<PB N="38" REF="42">
perceiving him&s;elf amu&s;ed by Tyrconnel, had publi&s;hed a
declaration, requiring the Iri&s;h to lay down their arms,
and &s;ubmit to the new government. On the twenty-&s;econd
day of February, thirty &s;hips of war had been put
in commi&s;&s;ion, and the command of them conferred upon
Admiral Herbert; but, the armament was retarded in
&s;uch a manner by the di&s;putes of the council, and the
King's attention to the affairs of the continent, that the
Admiral was not in a condition to &s;ail till the beginning
of April, and then with part of his fleet only. James
was received with open arms at Kin&s;ale, and the whole
country &s;eemed to be at his devotion; for, although the
prote&s;tants in the North had declared for the new govern|ment,
their &s;trength and number was deemed incon&s;i|derable
when compared with the power of Tyrconnel.
This mini&s;ter had di&s;armed all the other prote&s;tant &s;ubjects
in one day, and a&s;&s;embled an army of thirty thou&s;and
foot, and eight thou&s;and cavalry, for the &s;ervice of his
ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. In the latter end of March, James made his
publick entry into Dublin, amid&s;t the acclamations of
the inhabitants. He was met at the ca&s;tle-gate by a pro|ce&s;&s;ion
of popi&s;h bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts in their pontificals,
bearing the ho&s;t, which he publickly adored. He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
from the Council-Board the Lord Granard, Judge Keat|ing,
and other prote&s;tants, who had exhorted the Lord
Lieutenant to an accommodation with the new govern|ment.
In their room he admitted the French Amba&s;&s;ador,
the Bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, Colonel Dorrington, and, by
degrees, the principal noblemen who accompanied him in
the expedition. On the &s;econd day after his arrival in
Dublin, he i&s;&s;ued five proclamations: the fir&s;t recalled all
the &s;ubjects of Ireland who had abandoned the kingdom,
by a certain time, on pain of outlawry and confi&s;cation,
and requiring all per&s;ons to join him again&s;t the Prince of
Orange. The &s;econd contained expre&s;&s;ions of acknow|ledgement
to his catholic &s;ubjects for their vigilance and
fidelity, and an injunction to &s;uch as were not actually in
<PB N="39" REF="43">
his &s;ervice, to retain and lay up their arms until it &s;hould
be found nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e them for his advantage. By the
third he invited the &s;ubjects to &s;upply his army with pro|vi&s;ions;
and prohibited the &s;oldiers to take any thing
without payment. By the fourth he rai&s;ed the value of
the current coin; and in the fifth he &s;ummoned a parlia|ment
to meet on the &s;eventh day of May at Dublin.
Finally, he created Tyrconnel a duke, in con&s;ideration
of his eminent &s;ervices.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. The adherents of James in England pre&s;&s;ed
him to &s;ettle the affairs of Ireland immediately, and bring
over his army either to the north of England, or the we&s;t
of Scotland, where it might be joined by his party, and
act without delay again&s;t the u&s;urper; but his council
di&s;&s;uaded him from complying with their &s;ollicitations,
until Ireland &s;hould be totally reduced to obedience. On
the fir&s;t alarm of an intended ma&s;&s;acre, the prote&s;tants of
Londonderry had &s;hut their gates again&s;t the regiment
commanded by the Earl of Antrim, and re&s;olved to defend
them&s;elves again&s;t the Lord-Lieutenant. They tran&s;|mitted
this re&s;olution to the government of England,
together with an account of the danger they incurred by
&s;uch a vigorous mea&s;ure, and implored immediate a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.
They were accordingly &s;upplied with &s;ome arms
and ammunition, but did not receive any con&s;iderable
re-enforcement till the middle of April, when two regi|ments
arrived in Loughfoyl, under the command of Cun|ningham
and Richards. By this time, King James had
taken Coleraine, inve&s;ted Killmore, and was almo&s;t in
&s;ight of Londonderry. George Walker, Rector of
Donaghmore, who had rai&s;ed a regiment for the defence
of the prote&s;tants, conveyed this intelligence to Lundy,
the governor. This officer directed him to join Colonel
Crafton, and take po&s;t at the Long-cau&s;ey, which he
maintained a whole night again&s;t the advanced guard of
the enemy, until being overpowered by numbers, he re|treated
to Londonderry, and exhorted the governor to
take the field, as the army of King James was not yet
<PB N="40" REF="44">
completely formed. Lundy a&s;&s;embling a council of war,
at which Cunningham and Richards a&s;&s;i&s;ted, they agreed,
that as the place was not tenable, it would be imprudent
to land the two regiments; and that the principal officers
&s;hould withdraw them&s;elves from Londonderry, the inha|bitants
of which would obtain the more favourable capitu|lation
in con&s;equence of their retreat. An officer was
immediately di&s;patched to King James, with propo&s;als of
a negociation; and Lieutenant-General Hamilton agreed
that the army &s;hould halt at the di&s;tance of four miles
from the town. Notwith&s;tanding this preliminary, James
advanced at the head of his troops; but met with &s;uch a
warm reception from the be&s;ieged, that he was fain to
retire to St. John's town in &s;ome di&s;order. The inhabi|tants
and &s;oldiers in garri&s;on at Londonderry were &s;o in|cen&s;ed
at the members in the council of war, who had
re&s;olved to abandon the place, that they threatened imme|diate
vengeance. Cunningham and Richards retired to
their &s;hips, and Lundy locked him&s;elf in his chamber.
In vain did Walker and Major Baker exhort him to main|tain
his government. Such was his cowardice or trea|chery,
that he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to be concerned in the
defence of the place, and he was &s;uffered to e&s;cape in
di&s;gui&s;e, with a load of match upon his back; but he was
afterwards apprehended in Scotland, from whence he was
&s;ent to London to an&s;wer for his perfidy or mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. After his retreat, the town&s;men cho&s;e Mr.
Walker and Major Baker for their governors, with joint
authority; but this office they would not undertake, until
it had been offered to Colonel Cunningham, as the officer
next in command to Lundy. He rejected the propo&s;al,
and with Richards returned to England, where they were
immediately ca&s;hiered. The two new governors, thus
abandoned to their fate, began to prepare for a vigorous
defence: indeed, their courage &s;eems to have tran&s;cended
the bounds of di&s;cretion, for the place was very ill forti|fied:
their cannon, which did not exceed twenty pieces,
were wretchedly mounted: they had not one engineer to
<PB N="41" REF="45">
direct their operations: they had a very &s;mall number of
hor&s;e: the garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of people unacquainted with
military di&s;cipline: they were de&s;titute of provi&s;ions:
they were be&s;ieged by a King in per&s;on, at the head of a
formidable army, directed by good officers, and &s;upplied
$$th all the nece&s;&s;ary implements for a &s;iege or battle.
$his town was inve&s;ted on the twentieth day of April:
$word$ batteries were &s;oon opened, and &s;everal attacks were
made with great impetuo&s;ity; but the be&s;iegers were
always repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s. The town&s;men
gained divers advantages in repeated &s;allies, and would
have held their enemies in the utmo&s;t contempt, had not
they been afflicted with a contiguous di&s;temper, as well as
reduced to extremity by want of provi&s;ion. They were
even tantalized in their di&s;tre&s;s; for they had the mortifi|cation
to &s;ee &s;ome &s;hips which had arrived with &s;upplies
from England prevented from &s;ailing up the river by the
batteries the enemy had rai&s;ed on both &s;ides, and a boom
with which they had blocked up the channel. At length,
a re-enforcement arrived in the Lough, under the command
of General Kirke, who had de&s;erted his ma&s;ter, and
been employed in the &s;ervice of King William. He found
$eans to convey intelligence to Walker, that he had
$roops and provi&s;ions on board for their relief, but found it
$mpracticable to &s;ail up the river: he promi&s;ed, however,
$hat he would land a body of forces at the Inch, and
$ndeavour to make a diver&s;ion in their favour, when
$ined by the troops at Inni&s;killin, which amounted to
$ive thou&s;and men, including two thou&s;and cavalry. He
$aid he expected &s;ix thou&s;and men from England, where
$hey were embarked before he &s;et &s;ail. He exhorted them
$word$ per&s;evere in their courage and loyalty, and a&s;&s;ured
$hem he would come to their relief at all hazards. The&s;e
$&s;&s;urances enabled them to bear their mi&s;eries a little
$onger, though their numbers daily dimini&s;hed. Major
$aker dying, his place was filled with Colonel Michel|$rn,
who now acted as colleague to Mr. Walker.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="46">
&sect; XXXIV. King James having returned to Dublin, to
be pre&s;ent at the parliament, the command of his army
devolved to the French General Ro&s;ene, who was exa&s;|perated
at &s;uch an ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition by a handful of
half-&s;tarved militia. He threatened to raze the town to
its foundations, and de&s;troy the inhabitants, without
di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex, unle&s;s they would immediately
&s;ubmit them&s;elves to their lawful &s;overeign. The governors
treated his menaces with contempt, and publi&s;hed an
order, that no per&s;on, on pain of death, &s;hould talk of
&s;urrendering. They had now con&s;umed the la&s;t remains
of their provi&s;ion, and &s;upported life by eating the fle&s;h of
hor&s;es, dogs, cats, rats, mice, tallow, &s;tarch, and &s;alted
hides; and even this loath&s;ome food began to fail. Ro&s;ene,
finding them deaf to all his propo&s;als, threatened to wreak
his vengeance on all the prote&s;tants of that country, and
drive them under the walls of Londonderry, where they
&s;hould be &s;uffered to peri&s;h by famine. The Bi&s;hop of
Meath, being informed of this de&s;ign, complained to
King James of the barbarous intention, entreating his
Maje&s;ty to prevent its being put in execution. That
prince a&s;&s;ured him that he had already ordered Ro&s;ene to
de&s;i&s;t from &s;uch proceedings. Neverthele&s;s, the Frenchman
executed his threats with the utmo&s;t rigour. Parties of
dragoons were detached on this cruel &s;ervice: after having
&s;tripped all the prote&s;tants for thirty miles round, they
drove tho&s;e unhappy people before them like cattle, with|out
even &s;paring the enfeebled old men, nur&s;es with
infants at their brea&s;ts, tender children, women ju&s;t de|livered,
and &s;ome even in the pangs of labour. Above
four thou&s;and of the&s;e mi&s;erable objects were driven under
the walls of Londonderry. This expedient, far from
an&s;wering the purpo&s;e of Ro&s;ene, produced a quite con|trary
effect. The be&s;ieged were &s;o exa&s;perated at this act
of inhumanity, that they re&s;olved to peri&s;h rather than
&s;ubmit to &s;uch a barbarian. They erected a gibbet in
&s;ight of the enemy, and &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the French
general, importing, That they would hang all the pri|&s;oners
<PB N="43" REF="47">
they had taken during the &s;iege, unle&s;s the pro|te&s;tants
whom they had driven under the walls &s;hould be
immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. This threat produced a negocia|tion,
in con&s;equence of which the prote&s;tants were re|$$&s;ed,
after they had been detained three days without
$$$ting food. Some hundreds died of famine or fatigue;
$word$ tho&s;e who lived to return to their own habitations
$$und them plundered and &s;acked by the papi&s;ts, &s;o that
$word$ greater number peri&s;hed for want, or were murdered
by the &s;traggling parties of the enemy: yet the&s;e very
people had for the mo&s;t part obtained protections from
King James, to which no re&s;pect was paid by his
general.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. The garri&s;on of Londonderry was now
$educed from &s;even to five thou&s;and &s;even hundred men,
$nd the&s;e were driven to &s;uch extremity of di&s;tre&s;s, that
$hey began to talk of killing the popi&s;h inhabitants, and
$eeding on their bodies. In this emergency, Kirke, who
$ad hitherto lain inactive, ordered two &s;hips laden with
$rovi&s;ion to &s;ail up the river, under convoy of the Dart|mouth
frigate. One of the&s;e, called the Mountjoy, broke
$he enemy's boom; and all the three, after having
$u&s;tained a very hot fire from both &s;ides of the river,
arrived in &s;afety at the town, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible joy of
$he inhabitants. The army of James were &s;o di&s;pirited
by the &s;ucce&s;s of this enterpri&s;e, that they abandoned the
$iege in the night, and retired with precipitation, after
$aving lo&s;t about nine thou&s;and men before the place.
Kirke no &s;ooner took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, than Walker
was prevailed upon to embark for England, with an ad|$re&s;s
of thanks from the inhabitants to their Maje&s;ties for
$he &s;ea&s;onable relief they had received.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. The Inni&s;killiners were no le&s;s remarkable
$han the people of Londonderry for the valour and per&s;e|verance
with which they oppo&s;ed the papi&s;ts. They
$ai&s;ed twelve companies, which they regimented under
$he command of Gu&s;tavus Hamilton, whom they cho&s;e
for their governor. They proclaimed William and Mary
<PB N="44" REF="48">
on the eleventh day of March; and re&s;olved in a general
council to maintain their title again&s;t all oppo&s;ition. The
Lord Gilmoy inve&s;ted the ca&s;tle of Crom belonging to
the prote&s;tants in the neighbourhood of Inni&s;killin, the
inhabitants of which threw &s;uccours into the place, and
compelled Gilmoy to retire to Belturbet. A detachment
of the garri&s;on, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Lloyd,
took and demoli&s;hed the Ca&s;tle of Aughor, and they
gained the advantage in &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes with the enemy.
On the day that preceded the relief of Londonderry, they
defeated &s;ix thou&s;and Iri&s;h papi&s;ts at a place called New|ton-Butler,
and took their Commander Maccarty, com|monly
called Lord Monca&s;hel.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. The Iri&s;h parliament being a&s;&s;embled at
Dublin, according to the proclamation of King James,
he, in a &s;peech from the throne, thanked them for the
zeal, courage, and loyalty they had manife&s;ted; extolled
the genero&s;ity of the French King, who had enabled him
to vi&s;it them in per&s;on; in&s;i&s;ted upon executing his
de&s;ign of e&s;tabli&s;hing liberty of con&s;cience as a &s;tep
equally agreeable to the dictates of humanity and di&s;cre|tion,
and promi&s;ed to concur with them in enacting &s;uch
laws as would contribute to the peace, affluence, and
&s;ecurity of his &s;ubjects. Sir Richard Neagle, being cho&s;en
Speaker of the Commons, moved for an addre&s;s of thanks
to his Maje&s;ty, and that the Count D'Avaux &s;hould be
de&s;ired to make their acknowledgements to the Mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian King, for the generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance he had given
to their Sovereign. The&s;e addre&s;&s;es being drawn up,
with the concurrence of both Hou&s;es, a bill was brought
in to recognize the King's title, to expre&s;s their abhor|rence
of the u&s;urpation by the Prince of Orange, as well
as of the defection of the Engli&s;h. Next day James pub|li&s;hed
a declaration, complaining of the calumnies which
his enemies had &s;pread to his prejudice; expatiating upon
his own impartiality in preferring his prote&s;tant &s;ubjects;
his care in protecting them from their enemies, in re|dre&s;&s;ing
their grievances, and in granting liberty of con|$$$ence;
<PB N="45" REF="49">
promi&s;ing that he would take no &s;tep but with
the approbation of parliament; offering a free pardon to
all per&s;ons who &s;hould de&s;ert his enemies, and join with
him in four-and-twenty days after his landing in Ireland,
$word$ charging all the blood that might be &s;hed upon tho&s;e
$word$ &s;hould continue in rebellion.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. His conduct, however, very ill agreed
$$th this declaration; nor can it be excu&s;ed on any other
$$ppo&s;ition, but that of his being governed in &s;ome ca&s;es,
$gain&s;t his own inclination, by the Count D'Avaux, and
$word$ Iri&s;h catholicks, on whom his whole dependence was
$aced. As both Hou&s;es were chiefly filled with members
$word$ that per&s;ua&s;ion, we ought not to wonder at their bring|$$g
in a bill for repealing the act of &s;ettlement, by which
$word$ prote&s;tants of the kingdom had been &s;ecured in the
$o&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their e&s;tates. The&s;e were by this law dive&s;ted
$f their lands, which reverted to the heirs of tho&s;e catho|$$cks
to whom they belonged before the rebellion. This
$$iquitous bill was framed in &s;uch a manner, that no
$egard was paid to &s;uch prote&s;tant owners as had pur|$ha&s;ed
e&s;tates for valuable con&s;iderations: no allowance
was made for improvements, nor any provi&s;ion for pro|$e&s;tant
widows: the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or and tenants were not even
$$llowed to remove their &s;tock and corn. When the bill
was &s;ent up to the Lords, Dr. Dopping, Bi&s;hop of Meath,
$$ppo&s;ed it with equal courage and ability; and an addre&s;s
$word$ behalf of the purcha&s;ers under the act of &s;ettlement was
$re&s;ented to the King by the Earl of Granard: but, not|with&s;tanding
the&s;e remon&s;trances, it received the royal
$&s;&s;ent; and the prote&s;tants of Ireland were mo&s;tly ruined.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. Yet, in order to complete their de&s;truction,
$word$ act of attainder was pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t all prote&s;tants,
$hether male or female, whether of high or low degree,
$ho were ab&s;ent from the kingdom, as well as again&s;t all
$ho&s;e who retired into any part of the three kingdoms,
which did not own the authority of King James, or corre|$ponded
with rebels, or were any ways aiding, abetting, or
$&s;&s;i&s;ting to them from the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t in the pre|ceding
<PB N="46" REF="50">
year. The number of prote&s;tants attainted by
name in this act amounted to about three thou&s;and, in|cluding
two Archbi&s;hops, one Duke, &s;eventeen Earls,
&s;even Counte&s;&s;es, as many Bi&s;hops, eighteen Barons, three-and-thirty
Baronets, one-and-fifty knights, eighty-three
clergymen, who were declared traitors, and adjudged to
&s;uffer the pains of death and forfeiture. The individuals
&s;ubjected to this dreadful pro&s;cription were even cut off
from all hope of pardon, and all benefit of appeal: for, by
a clau&s;e in the act, the King's pardon was deemed null,
unle&s;s enrolled before the fir&s;t day of December. A &s;ub|&s;equent
law was enacted, declaring Ireland independent of
the Engli&s;h parliament. This a&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed another
act, granting twenty thou&s;and pounds per annum, out of
the forfeited e&s;tates, to Tyrconnel, in acknowledgement of
his &s;ignal &s;ervices: they impo&s;ed a tax of twenty thou&s;and
pounds per month for the &s;ervice of the King: the royal
a&s;&s;ent was given to an act for liberty of con&s;cience: they
enacted that the tithes payable by papi&s;ts &s;hould be de|livered
to prie&s;ts of that communion: the maintenance of
the prote&s;tant clergy in cities and corporations was taken
away; and all di&s;&s;enters were exempted from eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal
juri&s;dictions. So that the e&s;tabli&s;hed church was
deprived of all power and prerogative; notwith&s;tanding
the expre&s;s promi&s;e of James, who had declared, immedi|ately
after his landing, that he would maintain the clergy
in their rights and privileges.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. Nor was the King le&s;s arbitrary in the executive
part of his government, if we &s;uppo&s;e that he counte|nanced
the grievous acts of oppo&s;ition that were daily
committed upon the prote&s;tant &s;ubjects of Ireland: but
the tyranny of his proceedings may be ju&s;tly imputed to
the temper of his mini&s;try, con&s;i&s;ting of men abandoned
to all &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice and humanity, who acted from the
dictates of rapacity and revenge, inflamed with all the
acrimony of religious rancour. Soldiers were permitted
to live upon free quarter: the people were robbed and
plundered: licen&s;es and protections were abu&s;ed, in order
<PB N="47" REF="51">
$word$ extort money from the trading part of the nation. The
$ing's old &s;tores were ran&s;acked: the &s;hops of trade&s;men,
$word$ the kitchens of burghers, were pillaged to &s;upply the
$int with a quantity of bra&s;s, which was converted into
$rrent coin for his Maje&s;ty's occa&s;ions: an arbitrary
$lue was &s;et upon it, and all per&s;ons were required and
$mmanded to take it in payment, under the &s;evere&s;t
$nalties, though the proportion between its intrin&s;ick
$orth and currency was nearly as one to three hundred.
$word$ va&s;t &s;um of this counterfeit coin was i&s;&s;ued in the
$ur&s;e of one year, and forced upon the prote&s;tants in
$ayment of merchandi&s;e, provi&s;ion, and nece&s;&s;aries for the
$ing's &s;ervice. James, not content with the &s;upply
$ranted by parliament, impo&s;ed by his own authority a
$word$ of twenty thou&s;and pounds per month on chattels, as
$word$ former was laid upon lands. This &s;eems to have been
$temporary expedient during the adjournment of the two
Hou&s;es, as the term of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment was limited to three
$onths: it was, however, levied by virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion
$nder the &s;eals; and &s;eems to have been a &s;tretch of pre|$ogative,
the le&s;s excu&s;able, as he might have obtained
$word$ money in a parliamentary way. Under&s;tanding that
$word$ prote&s;tants had laid out all their bra&s;s money, in pur|$ha&s;ing
great quantities of hides, tallow, wool, and corn,
$word$ a&s;&s;umed the de&s;potick power of fixing the prices of
$he&s;e commodities and then bought them for his own
$&s;e. One may &s;ee his mini&s;ters were bent upon the
$tter de&s;truction of tho&s;e unhappy people.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. All vacancies in publick &s;chools were &s;upplied
$ith popi&s;h teachers. The pen&s;ion allowed from the
$xchequer to the univer&s;ity of Dublin was cut off: the
Vice-provo&s;t, Fellows, and &s;cholars were expelled: their
$rniture, plate, and publick library, were &s;ei&s;ed, without
$word$ lea&s;t &s;hadow of pretence, and in direct violation of a
$romi&s;e the King had made to pre&s;erve their privileges and
$mmunities. His officers converted the college into a gar|$i&s;on,
the chapel into a magazine, and the apartments into
$ri&s;ons: a popi&s;h prie&s;t was appointed provo&s;t: one Mac
<PB N="48" REF="52">
carty of the &s;ame per&s;ua&s;ion was made library-keeper; and
the whole foundation was changed into a catholick &s;emi|nary.
When bi&s;hopricks and benefices in the gift of the
crown became vacant, the King ordered the profits to be
lodged in the Exchequer, and &s;uffered the cures to be
totally neglected. The revenues were chiefly employed
in the maintenance of Romi&s;h bi&s;hops and prie&s;ts, who
grew &s;o in&s;olent under this indulgence, that in &s;everal
places they forcibly &s;ei&s;ed the prote&s;tant churches. When
complaint was made of this outrage, the King promi&s;ed to
do ju&s;tice to the injured; and in &s;ome places actually
ordered the churches to be re&s;tored: but the popi&s;h clergy
refu&s;ed to comply with this order, alledging, that in &s;piri|tuals
they owed obedience to no earthly power but the
holy &s;ee; and James found him&s;elf unable to protect his
prote&s;tant &s;ubjects again&s;t a powerful body which he dur&s;t
not di&s;oblige. Some &s;hips appearing in the bay of Dublin,
a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, forbidding the prote&s;tants to
a&s;&s;emble in any place of wor&s;hip, or el&s;ewhere, on pain of
death. By a &s;econd, they were commanded to bring in
their arms, on pain of being treated as rebels and traitors.
Luttrel, governor of Dublin, publi&s;hed an ordinance by
beat of drum, requiring the farmers to bring in their corn
for his Maje&s;ty's hor&s;es within a certain day, otherwi&s;e
he would order them to be hanged before their own doors.
Brigadier Sarsfield commanded all prote&s;tants of a certain
di&s;trict to retire to the di&s;tance of ten miles from their
habitations, on pain of death; and, in order to keep up
the credit of the bra&s;s money, the &s;ame penalty was de|nounced,
in a proclamation, again&s;t any per&s;on who &s;hould
give more than one pound eighteen &s;hillings for a guinea.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. All the revenues of Ireland, and all the
&s;chemes contrived to bol&s;ter up the credit of this ba&s;e coin,
would have proved in&s;ufficient to &s;upport the expen&s;es of
the war, had not James received occa&s;ional &s;upplies from
the French monarch. After the return of the fleet which
had conveyed him to Ireland, Louis &s;ent another &s;trong
&s;quadron, commanded by Chateau Renault, as a convoy
<PB N="49" REF="53">
to &s;ome tran&s;ports laden with arms, ammunition, and a
large &s;um of money for the u&s;e of King James. Before
they &s;ailed from Bre&s;t, King William being informed of
their de&s;tination, detached Adm. Herbert from Spithead,
with twelve &s;hips of the line, one fire&s;hip, and four
$enders, in order to intercept the enemy. He was driven
$word$ &s;tre&s;s of weather into Milford-haven, from whence he
$eered his cour&s;e to Kin&s;ale, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the
$rench fleet had &s;ailed from Bre&s;t; and that in all pro|bability
he &s;hould fall in with them on the coa&s;t of Ireland.
On the fir&s;t day of May he di&s;covered them at anchor in
Bantry-bay, and &s;tood in to engage them, though they
were greatly &s;uperior to him in number. They no &s;ooner
perceived him at day-break, than they weighed, &s;tood
out to windward, formed their line, bore down, and be|gan
the action, which was maintained for two hours with
equal valour on both &s;ides, though the Engli&s;h fleet &s;u&s;|tained
con&s;iderable damage from the &s;uperior fire of the
$nemy. Herbert tacked &s;everal times, in hope of gaining
the weather-gage: but the French Admiral kept his wind
with uncommon &s;kill and per&s;everance. At length the
Engli&s;h &s;quadron &s;tood off to &s;ea, and maintained a run|ning
fight till five in the afternoon, when Chateau Re|nault
tacked about, and returned into the bay, content
with the honour he had gained. The lo&s;s of men was in|con&s;iderable
on both &s;ides; and where the odds were &s;o
great, the victor could not reap much glory. Herbert re|$ired
to the i&s;les of Scilly, where he expected a re|$nforcement:
but being di&s;appointed in this expectation,
$word$ returned to Port&s;mouth, in very ill humour, with
which his officers and men were infected. The common
$$ilors &s;till retained &s;ome attachment to James, who had
$rmerly been a favourite among them; and the officers
$omplained that they had been &s;ent upon this &s;ervice
$ith a force &s;o much inferior to that of the enemy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Rere&s;by. King. Belcarres. De la Fay|ette. Voltaire.</NOTE> King

on the captains A&s;hby and Shovel, and be&s;towed a dona|tion
of ten &s;hillings on every private &s;ailor.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. The parliament of England thought it in|cumbent
upon them, not only to rai&s;e &s;upplies for the
maintenance of the war in which the nation was involved,
but al&s;o to do ju&s;tice with re&s;pect to tho&s;e who had been
injured by illegal or oppre&s;&s;ive &s;entences in the late reigns.
The attainders of Lord Ru&s;&s;el, Algernon Sidney, Alder|man
Corni&s;h, and Lady Li&s;le, were now rever&s;ed. A
committee of privileges was appointed by the Lords, to
examine the ca&s;e of the Earl of Devon&s;hire, who in the
late reign had been fined in thirty thou&s;and pounds, for
a&s;&s;aulting Colonel Culpepper in the pre&s;ence-chamber.
They reported that the court of King's-bench, in over|ruling
the Earl's plea of privilege of parliament, had com|mitted
a manife&s;t breach of privilege: that the fine was
exce&s;&s;ive and exorbitant, again&s;t the great charter, the
common right of the &s;ubject, and the law of the realm.
The &s;entence pronounced upon Samuel John&s;on, chaplain
to Lord Ru&s;&s;el, in con&s;equence of which he had been de|graded,
fined, &s;courged, and &s;et in the pillory, was now
annulled, and the commons recommended him to his
Maje&s;ty for &s;ome eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferment. He received
one thou&s;and pounds in money, with a pen&s;ion of three
hundred pounds for his own life and that of his &s;on, who
was moreover gratified with a place of one hundred a
pounds a year: but the father never obtained any eccle&s;i|a&s;tical
benefice. Titus Oates &s;eized this opportunity of
petitioning the Hou&s;e of Lords for a rever&s;al of the judg|ment
given again&s;t him on his being convicted of perjury.
The opinions of all the judges and council at the bar were
heard on this &s;ubject, and a bill of rever&s;al pa&s;&s;ed the
Commons: but the peers having in&s;erted &s;ome amend|ments
and a provi&s;o, a conference was demanded, and
violent heats en&s;ued. Oates, however, was relea&s;ed from
con&s;inement; and the Lords, with the con&s;ent of the
<PB N="51" REF="55">
Commons, recommended him to his Maje&s;ty for a par|don,
which he obtained, together with a comfortable
pen&s;ion. The committee appointed to enquire into the
ca&s;es of the &s;tate-pri&s;oners, found Sir Robert Wright,
late Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, to have been concerned in the
cruelties committed in the We&s;t after the in&s;urrection of
Monmouth; as al&s;o one of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion|ers,
and guilty of manifold enormities. Death had by this
time delivered Jeffries from the re&s;entment of the nation.
Graham and Burton had acted as &s;olicitors in the illegal
pro&s;ecutions carried on again&s;t tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed the
court in the reign of Charles II. the&s;e were now reported
guilty of having been in&s;trumental in taking away the
lives and e&s;tates of tho&s;e who had &s;uffered the lo&s;s of ei|ther
under colour of law, for eight years la&s;t pa&s;t; of ha|ving,
by malicious indictments, informations, and pro&s;e|cutions
of <HI>Quo Warranto,</HI> endeavoured the &s;ubver&s;ion of
the prote&s;tant religion, and the government of the realm;
and of having wa&s;ted many thou&s;and pounds of the pub|lic
revenue in the cour&s;e of their infamous practices.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. Nor did the mi&s;conduct of the pre&s;ent mini&s;|try
e&s;cape the animadver&s;ion of the parliament. The
Lords having addre&s;&s;ed the King to put the I&s;le of Wight,
Jer&s;ey, Guern&s;ey, Scilly, Dover-ca&s;tle, and the other for|tre&s;&s;es
of the kingdom, in a po&s;ture of defence, and to
di&s;arm the papi&s;ts, empowered a committee to enquire
into the mi&s;carriages in Ireland, which were generally
imputed to the neglect of the marqui&s;&s;es of Caermarthen
and Hallifax. They pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the King,
de&s;iring the minute-book of the committee for Iri&s;h af|fairs
might be put into their hands: but his Maje&s;ty de|clined
gratifying them in this particular: then the Com|mons
voted, that tho&s;e per&s;ons who had advi&s;ed the King
$word$ delay this &s;atisfaction were enemies to the kingdom.
William, alarmed at this re&s;olution, allowed them to in|&s;pect
the book, in which they found very little for their
purpo&s;e. The Hou&s;e re&s;olved that an addre&s;s &s;hould be
pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, declaring that the &s;uccour of
<PB N="52" REF="56">
Ireland had been retarded by unnece&s;&s;ary delays; that the
tran&s;ports prepared were not &s;ufficient to convey the for|ces
to that kingdom; and that &s;everal &s;hips had been ta|ken
by the enemy, for want of proper convoy. At the
&s;ame time the que&s;tion was put, Whether or not they
&s;hould addre&s;s the King again&s;t the marquis of Hallifax?
but it was carried in the negative by a &s;mall majority.
Before this period, Howe, vice-chamberlain to the Queen,
had moved for an addre&s;s again&s;t &s;uch coun&s;ellors as had
been impeached in parliament, and betrayed the liberties
of the nation. This motion was levelled at Caermarthen
and Hallifax, the fir&s;t of whom had been formerly im|peached
of high trea&s;on, under the title of Earl of Dan|by;
and the other was charged with all the mi&s;conduct of
the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration. Warm debates en&s;ued, and
in all probability the motion would have been carried in
the affirmative, had not tho&s;e who &s;poke warmly in
behalf of it &s;uddenly cooled in the cour&s;e of the di&s;pute.
Some letters from King James to his parti&s;ans being in|tercepted,
and containing &s;ome hints of an intended inva|&s;ion,
Mr. Hambden, chairman of the committee of the
whole Hou&s;e, enlarged upon the imminent danger to
which the kingdom was expo&s;ed, and moved for a further
&s;upply to his Maje&s;ty. In this unexpected motion, he was
not &s;econded by one member. The Hou&s;e, however,
having taken the letters into con&s;ideration, re&s;olved to
draw up an addre&s;s to the King, de&s;iring him to &s;ecure
and di&s;arm all papi&s;ts of note; and they brought in a bill
for attainting &s;everal per&s;ons in rebellion again&s;t their
Maje&s;ties; but it was not fini&s;hed during this &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect; XLV. Another bill being prepared in the Hou&s;e of
Lords, enjoining the &s;ubjects to wear the woollen manu|facture
at certain &s;ea&s;ons of the year, a petition was pre|&s;ented
again&s;t it by the &s;ilk-weavers of London and Can|terbury,
a&s;&s;embled in a tumultuous manner at We&s;t|min&s;ter.
The Lords refu&s;ed their petition, becau&s;e this
was an unu&s;ual manner of application. They were per|&s;uaded
to return to their re&s;pective places of abode: pre|cautions
<PB N="53" REF="57">
were taken again&s;t a &s;econd riot; and the bill was
unanimou&s;ly rejected in the Upper Hou&s;e. This parlia|ment
pa&s;&s;ed an act, ve&s;ting in the two univer&s;ities the pre|&s;entations
belonging to papi&s;ts: tho&s;e of the &s;outhern
counties being given to Oxford; and tho&s;e of the nor|thern
to Cambridge, on certain &s;pecified conditions.
Courts of con&s;cience were erected at Bri&s;tol, Glouce&s;ter,
and Newca&s;tle; and that of the mar&s;hes of Wales was
aboli&s;hed, as an intolerable oppre&s;&s;ion. The prote&s;tant
clergymen, who had been forced to leave their benefices in
Ireland, were rendered capable of holding any living in
England, without forfeiting their title to their former pre|ferment,
with the provi&s;o that they &s;hould re&s;ign their
Engli&s;h bene&s;ices when re&s;tored to tho&s;e they had been
obliged to relinqui&s;h. The &s;tatute of Henry IV. again&s;t
multiplying gold and &s;ilver was now repealed: the &s;ubjects
were allowed to melt and refine metals and ores, and ex|tract
gold and &s;ilver from them, on condition that it
&s;hould be brought to the Mint, and converted into mo|ney,
the owners receiving its full value in current coin.
The&s;e, and &s;everal other bills of &s;maller importance being
pa&s;&s;ed, the two hou&s;es adjourned to the twentieth day of
September, and afterwards to the nineteenth day of
October.</P>

&sect; I. THOUGH the affairs of Ireland were extremely
pre&s;&s;ing, and the prote&s;tants of that country had
made repeated application for relief, the &s;uccours were
retarded either by the di&s;putes among the mini&s;ters, or
the neglect of tho&s;e who had the management of the ex|pedition,
in &s;uch a manner, that King James had been
&s;ix months in Ireland before the army was embarked for
that kingdom. At length, eighteen regiments of infantry,
and five of dragoons being rai&s;ed for that &s;ervice, a train
of artillery provided, and tran&s;ports prepared, the Duke
of Schomberg, on whom King William had conferred
the chief command of this armament, &s;et out for Che&s;ter,
after he had in per&s;on thanked the Commons for the un|common
regard they had paid to his &s;ervices, and received
a&s;&s;urances from the Hou&s;e, that they would pay particular
attention to him and his army. On the thirteenth day of
Augu&s;t he landed in the neighbourhood of Carrickfergus
with about ten thou&s;and foot and dragoons, and took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Belfa&s;t, from whence the enemy retired at his
approach to Carrickfergus, where they re&s;olved to make
a &s;tand. The Duke having refre&s;hed his men, marched
thither, and inve&s;ted the place: the &s;iege was carried on
<PB N="56" REF="60">
till the twenty-&s;ixth day of the month, when the breaches
being practicable, the be&s;ieged capitulated, on condition
of marching out with their arms, and as much baggage
as they could carry on their backs; and of their being
conducted to the next Iri&s;h garri&s;on, which was at Newry.
During this &s;iege the Duke was joined by the re&s;t of his
army from England: but, he had left orders for con|veying
the greater part of the artillery and &s;tores from
Che&s;ter directly to Carlingford. He now began his
march through Li&s;burne and Hill&s;borough, and encamped
at Drummore, where the prote&s;tants of the North had
been lately routed by Hamilton: thence he proceeded to
Loughbrillane, where he was joined by the hor&s;e and
dragoons of Inni&s;killin. Then the enemy abandoned
Newry and Dundalk, in the neighbourhood of which
Schomberg encamped on a low, damp ground, having
the town and river on the &s;outh, and &s;urrounded on every
other part by hills, bogs, and mountains.</P>
<P>&sect; II. His army, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of new-rai&s;ed men
little inured to hard&s;hip, began to flag under the fatigue
of marching, the inclemency of the weather, and &s;car|city
of provi&s;ion. Here he was re-enforced by the regi|ments
of Kirke, Hanmer, and Stuart; and would have
continued his march to Drogheda, where he under&s;tood
Ro&s;ene lay with about twenty thou&s;and men, had he not
been obliged to wait for the artillery, which was not yet
arrived at Carlingford. King James, having a&s;&s;embled all
his forces, advanced towards Schomberg, and appeared
before his entrenchments in order of battle: but, the
Duke, knowing they were greatly &s;uperior in number of
hor&s;e, and that his own army was undi&s;ciplined, and
weakened by death and &s;ickne&s;s, re&s;trained his men
within the lines, and in a little time the enemy retreated.
Immediately after their departure, a con&s;piracy was di&s;|covered
in the Engli&s;h camp, hatched by &s;ome French
papi&s;ts, who had in&s;inuated them&s;elves into the prote&s;tant
regiments. One of the&s;e, who&s;e name was Du Ple&s;&s;is,
had written a letter to the Amba&s;&s;ador D'Avaux, pro|mi&s;ing
<PB N="57" REF="61">
to de&s;ert with all the papi&s;ts of the three French
regiments in Schomberg's army. This letter being found,
Du Ple&s;&s;is and five accomplices were tried by a court|martial,
and executed. About two hundred and fifty
papi&s;ts being di&s;covered in the French regiments, they
were &s;ent over to England, and from thence to Holland.
While Schomberg remained in this &s;ituation, the Inni&s;kil|liners
made excur&s;ions in the neighbourhood, under the
command of Colonel Lloyd; and on the twenty-&s;eventh
day of September they obtained a complete victory over
five times their number of the Iri&s;h. They killed &s;even
hundred on the &s;pot, and took O'Kelly their commander,
with about fifty officers, and a con&s;iderable booty of cattle.
The Duke was &s;o plea&s;ed with their behaviour on this
occa&s;ion, that they received a very honorable te&s;timony
of his approbation.</P>
<P>&sect; III. Mean while, the enemy took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of James-|Town,
and reduced Sligo, one of the forts of which was
gallantly defended by St. Sauveur, a French captain, and
his company of grenadiers, until he was obliged to capi|tulate,
for want of water and provi&s;ion. A contagious
di&s;temper &s;till continued to rage in Schomberg's camp,
and &s;wept off a great number of officers and &s;oldiers; &s;o
that in the beginning of next &s;pring, not above half the
number of tho&s;e who went over with the General re|mained
alive. He was cen&s;ured for his inactivity, and
the King, in repeated letters, de&s;ired him to hazard an
engagement, provided any opportunity &s;hould occur;
but he did not think proper to run the ri&s;que of a battle,
again&s;t an enemy that was above thrice his number, well|di&s;ciplined,
healthy, and conducted by able officers.
Neverthele&s;s, he was certainly blameable for having
cho&s;en &s;uch an unwhole&s;ome &s;ituation. At the approach
of winter he retired into quarters, in hopes of being re|enforced
with &s;even thou&s;and Danes, who had already
arrived in Britain. The&s;e auxiliaries were &s;tipulated in a
treaty which William had ju&s;t concluded with the King
<PB N="58" REF="62">
of Denmark. The Engli&s;h were not more &s;ucce&s;sful at
&s;ea than they had proved in their operations by land.
Admiral Herbert, now created Earl of Torrington, having
failed to Ireland with the combined &s;quadrons of England
and Holland, made a fruitle&s;s attempt upon Cork, and lo&s;t
a great number of &s;eamen by &s;ickne&s;s, which was imputed
to bad provi&s;ion. The Dartmouth &s;hip of war fell into
the hands of the enemy, who infe&s;ted the channel with
&s;uch a number of armed &s;hips and privateers, that the
trade of England &s;u&s;tained incredible damage.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. The affairs of France wore but a gloomy a&s;pect
on the continent, where all the powers of Europe &s;eemed
to have con&s;pired her con&s;truction. King William had en|gaged
in a new league with the States-General, in which
former treaties of peace and commerce were confirmed.
It was &s;tipulated, that, in ca&s;e the King of Great-Britain
&s;hould be attacked, the Dutch &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him with &s;ix
thou&s;and infantry and twenty &s;hips of the line; and that,
provided ho&s;tilities &s;hould be committed again&s;t the States-General,
England &s;hould &s;upply them with ten thou&s;and
infantry and twenty &s;hips of war. This treaty was no
&s;ooner ratified than King William di&s;patched the Lord
Churchill, whom he had by this time created Earl of
Marlborough, to Holland, in order to command the
Briti&s;h auxiliaries in that &s;ervice, to the number of eleven
thou&s;and, the greater part of which had been in the army
of King James when the Prince of Orange landed in Eng|land.
The Earl forthwith joined the Dutch army, under
the command of Prince Waldeck, who had fixed his ren|dezvous
in the county of Liege, with a view to act again&s;t
the French army, commanded by the Mare&s;chal D'Hu|mieres;
while the Prince of Vaudemont headed a little
army of ob&s;ervation, con&s;i&s;ting of Spaniards, Dutch, and
Germans, to watch the motions of Calvo in another part
of the Low-Countries. The city of Liege was compelled
to renounce the neutrality, and declare for the allies.
Mare&s;chal D'Humieres attacked the foragers belonging to
<PB N="59" REF="63">
the army of the States at Walcourt, in the month of Au|gu&s;t;
an ob&s;tinate engagement en&s;ued, and the French
were obliged to retreat in confu&s;ion, with the lo&s;s of two
thou&s;and men, and &s;ome pieces of artillery. The army of
ob&s;ervation levelled part of the French lines on the &s;ide of
Courtray, and rai&s;ed contributions on the territories of the
enemy.</P>
<P>&sect; V. The French were almo&s;t entire ma&s;ters of the
three eccle&s;ia&s;tical electorates of Germany. They po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
Mentz, Triers, Bonne, Kei&s;er&s;waert, Philip&s;burgh,
and Landau. They had blown up the ca&s;tle of Heidel|berg
in the Palatinate, and de&s;troyed Manheim. They
had reduced Worms and Spires to a&s;hes; and demoli&s;hed
Frankendahl, together with &s;everal other fortre&s;&s;es. The&s;e
conque&s;ts, the fruits of &s;udden inva&s;ion, were covered with
anumerous army, commanded by the Mare&s;chal de Duras;
and all his inferior generals were officers of di&s;tingui&s;hed
courage and ability. Neverthele&s;s, he found it difficult
to maintain his ground again&s;t the different princes of the
empire. The Duke of Lorraine, who commanded the
Imperial troops, inve&s;ted Mentz, and took it by capitu|lation:
the Elector of Brandenburgh, having reduced
Kei&s;er&s;waert, undertook the &s;iege of Bonne, which the gar|ri&s;on
&s;urrendered, after having made a long and vigorous
defence. Nothing contributed more to the union of the
German Princes than their re&s;entment of the &s;hocking
barbarity with which the French had plundered, wa&s;ted,
and depopulated their country. Louis having, by his
intrigues in Poland, and at Con&s;tantinople, prevented a
pacification between the Emperor and the Ottoman-porte,
the campaign was opened in Croatia, where five thou&s;and
Turks were defeated by a body of Croats between Vihitz
and Novi. The Prince of Baden, who commanded the
$mperiali&s;ts on that &s;ide, having thrown a bridge over the
Morava at Pa&s;&s;arowitz, cro&s;&s;ed that river, and marched in
que&s;t of the Turki&s;h army, amounting to fifty thou&s;and
men, headed by a Sera&s;kier. On the thirtieth day of
Augu&s;t he attacked the enemy in their entrenchments near
<PB N="60" REF="64">
Patochin, forced their lines, routed them with grea$
&s;laughter, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their camp, baggage, an$
artillery. They retreated to Ni&s;&s;a, where the Genera$
finding them &s;till more numerous than the Imperiali&s;ts
re&s;olved to make a &s;tand; and encamped in a &s;ituatio$
that was inacce&s;&s;ible in every part except the rear, which
he left open for the convenience of a retreat. Through
this avenue, he was, on the twenty-fourth day of Sep|tember,
attacked by the Prince of Baden, who, after a
de&s;perate re&s;i&s;tance, obtained another complete victory,
enriched his troops with the &s;poils of the enemy; and
entered Ni&s;&s;a without oppo&s;ition. There he found above
three thou&s;and hor&s;es and a va&s;t quantity of provi&s;ion.
Having repo&s;ed his army for a few days in this place, he
re&s;umed his march again&s;t the Turks, who had cho&s;en an
advantageous po&s;t at Widin, and &s;eemed ambitious of re|trieving
the honour they had lo&s;t in the two former en|gagements.
The Germans attacked their lines without
he&s;itation; and though the Mu&s;&s;ulmen fought with
incredible fury, they were a third time defeated with great
&s;laughter. This defeat was attended with the lo&s;s of
Widin, which being &s;urrendered to the victor, he di&s;tri|buted
his troops in winter-quarters, and returned to
Vienna, covered with laurels.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. The French were likewi&s;e baffled in their at|tempt
upon Catalonia, where the Duke de Noailles had
taken Campredon, in the month of May. Leaving a
garri&s;on in this place, he retreated to the frontiers of
France, while the Duke de Villa Hermo&s;a, at the head of
a Spani&s;h army, blocked up the place, and laid Rou&s;illon
under contribution. He afterwards undertook the &s;iege in
form, and Noailles marched to its relief: but, he was &s;o
hard pre&s;&s;ed by the Spaniards, that he withdrew the gar|ri&s;on,
di&s;mantled the place, and retreated with great pre|cipitation.
The French King hoped to derive &s;ome con|&s;iderable
advantage from the death of Pope Innocent XL
which happened on the twel$th day of Augu&s;t. That

$he affair of the franchi&s;es, and the &s;ei&s;ure of Avignon.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The franchi&s;es were privileges of a&s;ylum, annexed not only to the hou&s;es of Amba&s;&s;adors at Rome, but even to the whole di&s;trict in which any amba&s;&s;ador chanced to live. This privilege was become a terrible nui&s;ance, in as much as it afforded protection to the mo&s;t atrocious crimi|nals, who filled the city with rapine and murther. Innocent XI. re&s;olving to remove this evil, publi&s;hed a bull, aboli&s;hing the franchi&s;es, and almo&s;t $ll the catholick powers of Europe acquie&s;ced in what he had done, upon being duely informed of the grievance. Louis XIV. however, from a &s;pirit of pride and in&s;olence, refu&s;ed to part with any thing that looked like a prerogative of his crown. He &s;aid the King of France was not the imi|$ator, but a pattern and example for other princes. He rejected with di&s;|dain the mild repre&s;entations of the Pope: he &s;ent the Marquis de Lavar|$ain as his amba&s;&s;ador to Rome, with a formidable train, to in&s;ult Inno|$ent even in his own city. That nobleman &s;waggered through the &s;treets of Rome like a bravo, taking all opportunities to affront the Pope, who excommunicated him in revenge. On the other hand, the parliament of Paris appealed from the Pope's bull to a future council. Louis cau&s;ed the Pope's Nuncio to be put under arre&s;t, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Avignon which belonged to the See of Rome, and fet the holy $span$.</NOTE>
Cabals were immediately formed at Rome by the French
faction again&s;t the Spani&s;h and Imperial intere&s;t. The
French Cardinals de Bouillon and Bonzi, accompanied
by Fur&s;temberg, repaired to Rome with a large &s;um of
money. Peter Ottoboni, a Venetian, was elected Pope,
and a&s;&s;umed the name of Alexander VIII. The Duke
de Chaulnes, amba&s;&s;ador from France, immediately &s;igni|fied,
in the name of his ma&s;ter, that Avignon &s;hould be
re&s;tored to the patrimony of the church; and Louis
renounced the franchi&s;es, in a letter written by his own
hand to the new Pontiff. Alexander received the&s;e marks
of re&s;pect with the warme&s;t acknowledgements; but, when
the Amba&s;&s;ador and Fur&s;temberg be&s;ought him to re|examine
the election of the Bi&s;hop of Cologn, which had
been the &s;ource of &s;o much calamity to the empire, he
lent a deaf ear to their &s;ollicitations. He even confirmed
the di&s;pen&s;ations granted by his predece&s;&s;or to the Prince
of Bavaria, who was thus empowered to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the electorate, though he had not yet attained the age re|quired
by the canons. Fur&s;temberg retired in di&s;gu&s;t to
Paris, where Louis immediately gratified him with the
Abbey of St. Germains.</P>

&sect; VII. King William found it an ea&s;ier ta&s;k to unite
the councils of Europe again&s;t the common enemy, than
to conciliate and pre&s;erve the affections of his own &s;ub|jects,
among whom he began vi&s;ibly to decline in point of
popularity. Many were di&s;&s;atisfied with his mea&s;ures;
and a great number even of tho&s;e who exerted them&s;elves
for his elevation, had conceived a di&s;gu&s;t from his per|&s;onal
deportment, which was very un&s;uitable to the man|ners
and di&s;po&s;ition of the Engli&s;h people. In&s;tead of
mingling with his nobility in &s;ocial amu&s;ements and fa|miliar
conver&s;ation, he maintained a di&s;agreeable re&s;erve,
which had all the air of &s;ullen pride: he &s;eldom or never
&s;poke to his courtiers or attendants: he &s;pent his time
chie$ly in the clo&s;et, retired from all communication; or
among his troops, in a camp he had formed at Houn&s;low;
or in the exerci&s;e of hunting, to which he was immode|rately
addicted. This had been pre&s;cribed to him by phy|&s;icians,
as nece&s;&s;ary to improve his con&s;titution, which
was naturally weak, and by practice had become &s;o habi|tual,
that he could not lay it a&s;ide. His ill health, co|operating
with his natural aver&s;ion to &s;ociety, produced
a peevi&s;hne&s;s which could not fail of being di&s;plea&s;ing to
tho&s;e who were near his per&s;on: this was increa&s;ed by the
di&s;putes in his cabinet, and the oppo&s;ition of tho&s;e who
were profe&s;&s;ed enemies to his government, as well as by
the alienation of his former friends. As he could not
breathe without difficulty in the air of London, he re&s;ided
chiefly at Hampton-Court, and expended con&s;iderable &s;ums
in beautifying and enlarging that palace: he likewi&s;e pur|cha&s;ed
the hou&s;e at Ken&s;ington of the Earl of Notting|ham;
and &s;uch profu&s;ion, in the beginning of an expen&s;ive
war, gave umbrage to the nation in general. Whether he
was advi&s;ed by his coun&s;ellors, or his own &s;agacity pointed
out the expediency of conforming with the Engli&s;h
humour, he now &s;eemed to change his di&s;po&s;ition, and in
&s;ome mea&s;ure adopt the manners of his predece&s;&s;ors. In
imitation of Charles II. he re&s;orted to the races at New|market:
he accepted an invitation to vi&s;it Cambridge,
<PB N="63" REF="67">
where he behaved with remarkable affability to the mem|bers
of the Univer&s;ity: he afterwards dined with the
Lord-Mayor of London, accepted the freedom of the city,
$word$ conde&s;cended &s;o far as to become &s;overeign-ma&s;ter of
and company of grocers.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. While William thus endeavoured to remove
the prejudices which had been conceived again&s;t his per|&s;on,
the period arrived which the parliament had pre&s;cribed
for taking the oaths to the new government. Some indi|viduals
of the clergy &s;acrificed their benefices to their
&s;cruples of con&s;cience; and ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to take
oaths that were contrary to tho&s;e they had already &s;worn
in favour of their late &s;overeign. The&s;e were di&s;tingui&s;hed
by the epithet of Nonjurors: but their number bore a
very &s;mall proportion to that of others, who took them
with &s;uch re&s;ervations and di&s;tinctions as redounded very
little to the honour of their integrity. Many of tho&s;e
who had been the warme&s;t advocates for non-re&s;i&s;tance
and pa&s;&s;ive obedience made no &s;cruple of renouncing their
allegiance to King James, and complying with the pre&s;ent
act, after having declared that they took the oaths in no
other &s;en&s;e than that of a peaceable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the
powers that were. They even affirmed that the legi&s;la|ture
it&s;elf had allowed the di&s;tinction between a King <HI>de
facto</HI> and a King <HI>de jure,</HI> as they had dropped the word
&startq;rightful&endq; when the form was under debate. They
alledged that as prudence obliged them to conform to the
letter of the oath, &s;o con&s;cience required them to give it
their own interpretation. Nothing could be more infa|mous,
and of wor&s;e tendency, than this practice of equivo|cating
in the mo&s;t &s;acred of all obligations. It introduced
a general di&s;regard of oaths, which had been the &s;ource
of univer&s;al perjury and corruption. Though this &s;et of
tempori&s;ers were bitterly upbraided both by the nonjurors
and the papi&s;ts, they all concurred in repre&s;enting Wil|liam
as an enemy to the church; as a Prince educated in
the doctrine of Calvin, which he plainly e&s;pou&s;ed, by
limiting his favour and preferment to &s;uch as were latitu|dinarians
<PB N="64" REF="68">
in religion, and by his aboli&s;hing epi&s;copacy in
Scotland. The pre&s;byterians of that kingdom now tyran|ni&s;ed
in their turn. They were headed by the Earl of
Crawford, a nobleman of a violent temper and &s;trong
prejudices. He was cho&s;en pre&s;ident of the parliament
by the intere&s;t of Melvil, and oppre&s;&s;ed the epi&s;copalians
in &s;uch a manner, that the greater part of them, from re|&s;entment,
became well-wi&s;hers to King James. Every
circum&s;tance of the hard&s;hips they underwent was re|ported
in England; and the Earl of Clarendon, as well as
the &s;u&s;pended Bi&s;hops, circulated the&s;e particulars with
great a&s;&s;iduity. The oaths being rejected by the Arch|bi&s;hop
of Canterbury, the Bi&s;hops of Ely, Chice&s;ter, Bath
and Wells, Peterborough, and Glouce&s;ter, they were
&s;u&s;pended from their functions, and threatened with de|privation.
Lake of Chice&s;ter being &s;ei&s;ed with a dange|rous
di&s;temper, &s;igned a &s;olemn declaration, in which he
profe&s;&s;ed his adherence to the doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;tance
and pa&s;&s;ive obedience, which he believed to be the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
characteri&s;tick of the Church of England. After
his death this paper was publi&s;hed, indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated,
and extolled by the party, as an in&s;pired oracle pronounced
by a martyr to religious truth and &s;incerity.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. All the clamour that was rai&s;ed again&s;t the King
could not divert him from pro&s;ecuting the &s;cheme of com|prehen&s;ion.
He granted a commi&s;&s;ion under the great
&s;eal to ten bi&s;hops, and twenty dignitaries of the church,
authori&s;ing them to meet from time to time in the Jeru|&s;alem-chamber,
to prepare &s;uch alteration of the liturgy
and the canons, and &s;uch propo&s;als for the reformation of
eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts as might mo&s;t conduce to the good
order, edification, and uniting of the church, and tend
to reconcile all religious differences among the prote&s;tant
&s;ubjects of the kingdom. A cry was immediately rai&s;ed
again&s;t this commi&s;&s;ion, as an eccle&s;ia&s;tical court illegal
and dangerous. At their fir&s;t meeting, the authority of
the commi&s;&s;ion was que&s;tioned by Sprat, Bi&s;hop of Ro|che&s;ter,
who retired in di&s;gu&s;t, and was followed by Mew
<PB N="65" REF="69">
of Winche&s;ter, and the Doctors Jane and Aldrich. The&s;e
were aver&s;e to any alteration of the forms and con&s;titution
of the church, in favour of an in&s;olent and ob&s;tinate party,
which ought to have been &s;atisfied with the toleration they
$njoyed. They ob&s;erved, that an attempt to make &s;uch
alteration would divide the clergy, and bring the liturgy
into di&s;e&s;teem with the people, as it would be a plain
acknowledgement that it wanted correction. They
thought they &s;hould violate the dignity of the church, by
conde&s;cending to make offers which the di&s;&s;enters were at
liberty to refu&s;e; and they &s;u&s;pected &s;ome of their col|leagues
of a de&s;ign to give up epi&s;copal ordination&mdash;a &s;tep
incon&s;i&s;tent with their honour, duty, oaths, and &s;ub|&s;criptions.</P>
<P>&sect; X. The commi&s;&s;ioners, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ece&s;&s;ion,
proceeded to debate with moderation on the abu&s;es of
which the di&s;&s;enters had complained, and corrected every
article that &s;eemed liable to any ju&s;t objection; but the
oppo&s;ite party employed all their art and indu&s;try to in|flame
the minds of the people. The two univer&s;ities
declared again&s;t all alterations, and tho&s;e who promoted
them. The King him&s;elf was branded as an enemy to
the hierarchy; and they be&s;tirred them&s;elves &s;o &s;ucce&s;s|fully
in the election of members for the convocation, that
they procured a very con&s;iderable majority. At their fir&s;t
meeting, the friends of the comprehen&s;ion &s;cheme pro|po&s;ed
Dr. Tillot&s;on, clerk of the clo&s;et to his Maje&s;ty,
as prolocutor; but the other party carried it in favour of
Dr. Jane, who was counted the mo&s;t violent churchman
in the whole a&s;&s;embly. In a Latin &s;peech to the Bi&s;hop of
London as pre&s;ident, he, in the name of the Lower Hou&s;e,
a&s;&s;erted that the liturgy of England needed no amendment,
and concluded with the old declaration of the barons,
&startq;<HI>Nolumus leges Angliae mutari.</HI> We will not &s;uffer the
laws of England to be changed.&endq; The Bi&s;hop, in his reply,
exhorted them to moderation, charity, and indulgence
towards their brethren, the di&s;&s;enters, and to make &s;uch
abatements in things indifferent as might &s;erve to open a
<PB N="66" REF="70">
door of &s;alvation to multitudes of &s;traying chri&s;tians. His
injunctions, however, produced no favourable effect. The
Lower Hou&s;e &s;eemed to be animated by a &s;pirit of oppo&s;i|tion.
Next day the pre&s;ident prorogued them, on pretence
that the royal commi&s;&s;ion, by which they were to act,
was defective for want of being &s;ealed, and that a proro|gation
was nece&s;&s;ary until that &s;anction &s;hould be ob|tained.
In this interval means were u&s;ed to mollify their
noncompliant tempers, but all endeavours proved inef|fectual.
When they met again, the Earl of Nottingham
delivered the King's commi&s;&s;ion to both Hou&s;es, with a
&s;peech of his own, and a me&s;&s;age from his Maje&s;ty, im|porting,
that he had &s;ummoned them out of a pious zeal
to do every thing that might tend to the be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment
of the Church of England, which &s;hould always enjoy
his favour and protection. He exhorted them to lay a&s;ide
all prejudice, and con&s;ider calmly and impartially what|ever
&s;hould be propo&s;ed: he a&s;&s;ured them he would offer
nothing but what &s;hould be for the honour, peace, and
advantage, of the prote&s;tant religion in general, and par|ticularly
of the Church of England.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. The bi&s;hops, adjourning to the Jeru&s;alem-|chamber,
prepared a zealous addre&s;s of thanks to his
Maje&s;ty, which, being &s;ent to the Lower Hou&s;e for their
concurrence, met with violent oppo&s;ition. Amendments
were propo&s;ed; a conference en&s;ued, and, after warm
debates, they agreed upon a cold addre&s;s, which was ac|cordingly
pre&s;ented. The majority of the Lower Hou&s;e,
far from taking any mea&s;ures in &s;avour of di$$enters, con|verted
all their attention to the relief of their nonjuring
brethren. Zealous &s;peeches were made in behalf of the
&s;u&s;pended bi&s;hops; and Dr. Jane propo&s;ed that &s;ome|thing
might be done to qualify them to &s;it in the convo|cation.
This, however, was &s;uch a dangerous point as
they would not venture to di&s;cu&s;s; yet, rather than pro|ceed
upon the bu&s;ine&s;s for which they had been a&s;&s;embled,
they began to take cognizance of &s;ome pamphlets lately
publi&s;hed, which they conceived to be of dangerous
<PB N="67" REF="71">
con&s;equence to the chri&s;tian religion. The Pre&s;ident and
his party, perceiving the di&s;po&s;ition of the Hou&s;e, did
not think proper to communicate any propo&s;al touching
the intended reformation, and the King &s;uffered the
&s;e&s;&s;ion to be di&s;continued by repeated prorogations.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. The parliament meeting on the nineteenth day
of October, the King, in a &s;peech of his own compo&s;ing,
explained the nece&s;&s;ity of a pre&s;ent &s;upply to carry on the
war. He de&s;ired that they might be &s;peedy in their de|terminations
on this &s;ubject, for the&s;e would in a great
mea&s;ure influence the deliberations of the princes and
&s;tates concerned in the war again&s;t France, as a general
meeting of them was appointed to be held next month at
the Hague, to &s;ettle the operations of the en&s;uing cam|paign.
He concluded with recommending the di&s;patch of
a bill of indemnity, that the minds of his &s;ubjects might
be quieted, and that they might unanimou&s;ly concur in
promoting the honour and welfare of the kingdom. As
&s;everal inflammatory bills and di&s;putes, which had pro|duced
heats and animo&s;ities in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, were &s;till de|pending,
the King, after having con&s;ulted both Hou&s;es,
re&s;olved to put an end to tho&s;e di&s;putes by a prorogation.
He accordingly went to the Hou&s;e of Lords, and pro|rogued
the parliament till the twenty-fir&s;t day of October,
by the mouth of the new Speaker, Sir Robert Atkins, the
Marquis of Hallifax having re&s;igned that office. When
they re-a&s;&s;embled, the King referred them to his former
&s;peech: then the Commons unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to a&s;&s;i&s;t his
Maje&s;ty in reducing Ireland, and in joining with his allies
abroad for a vigorous pro&s;ecution of the war again&s;t France:
for the&s;e purpo&s;es they voted a &s;upply of two millions.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. During this &s;e&s;&s;ion the Whigs employed all
their influence and intrigues in ob&s;tructing the bill of
indemnity, which they knew would open a door for
favour and preferment to the oppo&s;ite party, which began
to gain ground in the King's good graces. With this
view they revived the pro&s;ecution of the &s;tate pri&s;oners.
A committee was appointed to prepare a charge again&s;t
<PB N="68" REF="72">
Burton and Graham. The Commons re&s;olved to im|peach
the Earls of Peterborough, Sali&s;bury, and Ca&s;tle|main,
Sir Edward Hales, and Obadiah Walker, of high
trea&s;on, for having been reconciled to the church of Rome,
contrary to the laws of the realm. A bill was ordered to
be brought in, to declare the e&s;tate of the late Lord Chan|cellor
Jeffries forfeited to the crown, and attaint his
blood; but it met with &s;uch oppo&s;ition that the mea&s;ure
was dropped: the Hou&s;e however agreed, that the pecu|niary
penalties incurred by tho&s;e per&s;ons who had exer|ci&s;ed
offices contrary to the laws again&s;t popi&s;h recu&s;ants
&s;hould be &s;peedily levied, and applied to the publick &s;er|vice.
The Lord Griffin being detected in maintaining a
corre&s;pondence with King James, and his parti&s;ans, was
committed to the Tower: but, as no other evidence ap|peared
again&s;t him than written letters, found in the fal&s;e
bottom of a pewter bottle, they could not help con&s;enting
to his being relea&s;ed upon bail, as they had lately re&s;olved
that Algernon Sidney was unju&s;tly condemned in the
reign of Charles II. becau&s;e nothing but writings had been
produced again&s;t him at his trial. The two Hou&s;es con|curred
in appointing a committee to enquire who were
the advi&s;ers and pro&s;ecutors in taking away the lives of
Lord Ru&s;&s;el, Colonel Sidney, Sir Thomas Arm&s;trong.
Alderman Corni&s;h, and others; and who were chiefly
concerned in the arbitrary practices touching the writs of
<HI>Quo Warranto,</HI> and the &s;urrender of charters. This en|quiry
was levelled at the Marquis of Hallifax, who had
concurred with the mini&s;try of Charles in all the&s;e &s;eve|rities.
Though no proof appeared, upon which votes or
addre&s;&s;es could be founded, that nobleman &s;aw it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for him to withdraw him&s;elf from the admini&s;tra|tion;
he, therefore, re&s;igned the privy-&s;eal, which was
put in commi&s;&s;ion, and reconciled him&s;elf to the Tories,
of whom he became the patron and protector.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. The Commons likewi&s;e re&s;umed the examina|tion
of the mi&s;carriages in Ireland, and de&s;ired the King
would appoint commi&s;&s;ioners, to go over and enquire into
<PB N="69" REF="73">
the condition of the army in that kingdom. Schomberg
under&s;tanding that he had been blamed in the Hou&s;e of
Commons for his inactivity, tran&s;mitted to the King a
&s;atisfactory vindication of his own conduct; and it ap|peared
that the mi&s;carriages in Ireland were wholly ow|ing
to John Shales, purveyor-general to the army. The
Commons immediately pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to his Ma|je&s;ty,
praying that Shales might be taken into cu&s;tody;
that all his papers, accounts, and &s;tores, &s;hould be &s;ecured;
and that Duke Schomberg might be empowered to fill
his place with a more able purveyor. The King gave
them to under&s;tand, that he had already &s;ent orders to
the General for that purpo&s;e. Neverthele&s;s, they in
another petition reque&s;ted his Maje&s;ty to name tho&s;e who
had recommended Shales to his &s;ervice, as he had exer|ci&s;ed
the &s;ame office under King James, and was &s;u&s;pected
of trea&s;onable practices again&s;t the government. William
declined gratifying their reque&s;t; but he afterwards &s;ent
a me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e, de&s;iring them to recommend a
certain number of commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;uperinted &s;uch pro|vi&s;ions
and preparations as might be nece&s;&s;ary for that
&s;ervice, as well as to nominate certain per&s;ons to go over
and examine the &s;tate of the army in Ireland. The
Commons were &s;o mollified by this in&s;tance of his con|de&s;cen&s;ion,
that they left the whole affair to his own di|rection,
and proceeded to examine other branches of mi&s;|conduct.
In&s;tances of mi&s;management appeared &s;o nu|merous
and &s;o flagrant, that they re&s;olved upon a &s;ub&s;e|quent
addre&s;s, to explain the ill conduct and &s;ucce&s;s of
his army and navy; to de&s;ire he would find out the au|thors
of the&s;e mi&s;carriages, and for the future entru&s;t
un&s;u&s;pected per&s;ons with the management of affairs. They
ordered the victuallers of the fleet to be taken into cu&s;to|dy,
on &s;u&s;picion of their having furni&s;hed the navy with
unwhol&s;ome provi&s;ions, and new commi&s;&s;ioners were ap|pointed.
Bitter reproaches were thrown out again&s;t the
mini&s;try. Mr. Hambden expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e that the
admini&s;tration &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of tho&s;e very per&s;ons whom
<PB N="70" REF="74">
King James had employed, when his affairs were de&s;pe|rate,
to treat with the Prince of Orange, and moved that
the King &s;hould be petitioned in an addre&s;s to remove
&s;uch per&s;ons from his pre&s;ence and councils. This was a
&s;troke aimed at the Earl of Nottingham, who&s;e office of
&s;ecretary Hambden de&s;ired to po&s;&s;e&s;s; but his motion
was not &s;econded, the court-members ob&s;erving that
James did not depute tho&s;e lords to the Prince of Orange
becau&s;e they were attached to his own intere&s;t, but for a
very different rea&s;on, namely, that they were well known
to di&s;approve of his mea&s;ures, and therefore would be
the more agreeable to his Highne&s;s. The Hou&s;e, howe|ver,
voted an addre&s;s to the King, de&s;iring that the au|thors
of the mi&s;carriages might be brought to condign
puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. In the &s;equel, the que&s;tion was propo&s;ed, Whe|ther
a placeman ought to have a &s;eat in the Hou&s;e? and
a very warm debate en&s;ued; but it was carried in the af|firmative,
on the &s;uppo&s;ition that by &s;uch exclu&s;ion the
common-wealth would be deprived of &s;ome of the able&s;t
&s;enators of the kingdom. But what chiefly irritated
William again&s;t the Whigs was their backwardne&s;s in
promoting the public &s;ervice, and their di&s;regard of the
earne&s;t de&s;ire he expre&s;&s;ed to &s;ee his revenue &s;ettled for
life. He &s;aid his title was no more than a pageant, and
the wor&s;t of all governments was that of a king without
trea&s;ure. Neverthele&s;s they would not grant the civil
li&s;t for a longer term than one year. They began to
think there was &s;omething arbitrary in his di&s;po&s;ition.
His &s;ullen behaviour, in all probability, fir&s;t infu&s;ed this
opinion, which was &s;trengthened and confirmed by the
in&s;inuations of his enemies. The Scots, who had come
up to London to give an account of the proceedings in
their parliament, were infected with the &s;ame notion.
One Simp&s;on, a pre&s;byterian of that country, whom the
Earl of Portland employed as a &s;py, had in&s;inuated him|&s;elf
into the confidence of Nevil Payne, an active and
intelligent parti&s;an and agent of King James; by which
<PB N="71" REF="75">
means he &s;upplied the earl with &s;uch intelligence as rai&s;ed
him to &s;ome degree of credit with that mini&s;ter. This he
u&s;ed in prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Earl again&s;t the King's be&s;t
friends, and infu&s;ing jealou&s;ies which were &s;oon kindled
into mutual di&s;tru&s;t and animo&s;ity.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. Sir James Montgomery, who had been a warm
advocate for the Revolution, received advice that the
court &s;u&s;pected him and others of di&s;affection, and was
employed in &s;eeking evidence by which they might be
pro&s;ecuted. They were equally alarmed and incen&s;ed at
this intimation, and Payne &s;ei&s;ed the opportunity of &s;edu|cing
them into a corre&s;pondence with the exiled King.
They demanded the &s;ettlement of pre&s;bytery in Scotland,
and actually engaged in a treaty for his re&s;toration. They
reconciled them&s;elves to the Duke of Queen&s;berry, and
the other noblemen of the epi&s;copal party: they wrote
to James for a &s;upply of money, arms, and ammunition,
together with a re-enforcement of three thou&s;and men
from Dunkirk. Montgomery had acquired great intere&s;t
among the Whigs of England, and this he employed in
animating them again&s;t the King and the mini&s;try. He
repre&s;ented them as a &s;et of wicked men, who employed
infamous &s;pies to en&s;nare and ruin the fa&s;t friends of the
government, and found means to alienate them &s;o much
from William, that they began to think in earne&s;t of re|calling
their bani&s;hed prince. The Duke of Bolton, and
the earl of Monmouth, were almo&s;t per&s;uaded into a con|&s;piracy
for this purpo&s;e; they &s;eemed to think James
was now &s;o well convinced of his former errors, that they
might tru&s;t him without &s;cruple. Montgomery and
Payne were the chief managers of the &s;cheme, and they
admitted Fergu&s;on into their councils, as a veteran in the
arts of trea&s;on. In order to bla&s;t William's credit in the
city, they circulated a report that James would grant a
full indemnity, &s;eparate him&s;elf entirely from the French
intere&s;t, and be contented with a &s;ecret connivance in fa|vour
of the roman catholics. Montgomery's brother a&s;|&s;ured
the Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, that a treaty with King
<PB N="72" REF="76">
James was ab&s;olutely concluded, and an invitation &s;ub|&s;cribed
by the whole cabal. He &s;aid this paper would be
&s;ent to Ireland by the way of France, as the direct com|munication
was difficult; and he propo&s;ed a method for
&s;eizing it before it &s;hould be conveyed out of the kingdom.
William&s;on, the &s;uppo&s;ed bearer of it, had obtained a pa&s;s
for Flanders, and a me&s;&s;enger being &s;ent in pur&s;uit of him,
&s;ecured his clothes and pormanteau; but, after a very
very &s;trict examination, nothing appeared to ju&s;tify the
intelligence. William&s;on had previou&s;ly delivered the pa|pers
to Simp&s;on, who hired a boat at Deal, and arrived in
&s;afety at France. He returned with large a&s;&s;urances, and
twelve thou&s;and pounds were remitted to the Scotti&s;h un|dertakers.
Montgomery, the informer, &s;eeing his intelli|gence
fal&s;ified, lo&s;t his credit with the Bi&s;hop, and dread|ing
the re&s;entment of the other party, retired to the conti|nent.
The con&s;pirators loudly complained of the fal&s;e im|putations
they had incurred. The pretended di&s;coveries
were looked upon as fictions of the mini&s;try, and the king
on this occa&s;ion &s;uffered greatly in the opinion of his &s;ub|jects.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. The Tories &s;till continued to carry on a &s;ecret
negociation with the court. They took advantage of the
ill-humour &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the King and the Whigs;
and promi&s;ed large &s;upplies of money, provided this par|liament
&s;hould be di&s;&s;olved, and another immediately con|voked.
The oppo&s;ite party, being appri&s;ed of their inten|tion,
brought a bill into the Hou&s;e of Commons for re&s;to|ring
corporations to their antient rights and privileges.
They knew their own &s;trength at elections con&s;i&s;ted in
the&s;e corporations; and they in&s;erted two additional &s;e|vere
clau&s;es again&s;t tho&s;e who were in any &s;hape con|cerned
in &s;urrendering charters. The whole power of
the Tories was exerted again&s;t this clau&s;e; and now the
Whigs vied with them in making court to his Maje&s;ty,
promi&s;ing to manife&s;t the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive obedience &s;hould
this bill be enacted into a law. The &s;trength of the To|ries
was now become &s;o formidable in the Hou&s;e, that they
outvoted the other party, and the clau&s;es were rejected;
<PB N="73" REF="77">
$word$ the bill pa&s;&s;ed in its original form. The Lords de|$ated
upon the point, Whether a corporation could be
$$rfeited or &s;urrendered? Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Holt and
two other Judges declared their opinion in the affirmative:
the re&s;t thought otherwi&s;e, as no precedents could be pro|duced
farther back than the reign of Henry VIII. when
the Abbies were &s;urrendered; and this in&s;tance &s;eemed too
violent to authori&s;e &s;uch a mea&s;ure in a regular cour&s;e of
admini&s;tration. The bill, however, pa&s;&s;ed by one voice
only. Then both parties quickened their applications to
the King, who found him&s;elf &s;o perplexed and di&s;tracted
between two factions which he equally feared, that he
re&s;olved to leave the government in the Queen's hands,
and retire to Holland. He communicated this de&s;ign to
the Marquis of Caermarthen, the Earl of Shrew&s;bury, and
&s;ome other noblemen, who pre&s;&s;ed him to lay a&s;ide his
re&s;olution, and even mingled tears in their remon&s;trances.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. He at length complied with their reque&s;t,
and determined to fini&s;h the Iri&s;h war in per&s;on. This
de&s;ign was far from being agreeable to the parliament.
His friends dreaded the climate of that country, which
might prove fatal to his weak con&s;titution. The well|wi&s;hers
of James were afraid of that prince's being hard
pre&s;&s;ed, &s;hould William take the field again&s;t him in per|&s;on:
both Hou&s;es, therefore, began to prepare an addre&s;s
again&s;t this expedition. In order to prevent this remon|&s;trance,
the King went to the parliament, and formally
&s;ignified his re&s;olution. After his &s;peech they were pro|rogued
to the &s;econd day of April. On the &s;ixth day of
February they were di&s;&s;olved by proclamation, and a new
parliament was &s;ummoned to meet on the twentieth day
of March. During this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the Commons, in an
addre&s;s to the King, de&s;ired that a revenue of fifty thou|&s;and
pounds might be &s;ettled upon the Prince and Prince&s;s
of Denmark, out of the civil li&s;t; and his Maje&s;ty grati|fied
them in this particular: yet, the warmth and in|du&s;try
with which the friends of the Prince&s;s exerted
them&s;elves in promoting the &s;ettlement produced a cold|ne&s;s
<PB N="74" REF="78">
and mi&s;under&s;tanding between the two &s;i&s;ters; and
the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;grace of the Earl of Marlborough was
imputed to the part which his wife acted on the occa&s;ion.
She was lady of the bed-chamber, and chief confident to
the Prince&s;s, whom &s;he &s;trenou&s;ly advi&s;ed to in&s;i&s;t upon
the &s;ettlement, rather than depend upon the genero&s;ity of
the King and Queen.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. About this period, General Ludlow, who at
the Re&s;toration had been excepted from the act of indem|nity,
as one of tho&s;e who &s;at in judgment upon Charles I.
arrived in England, and offered his &s;ervice in reducing
Ireland, where he had formerly commanded. Though a
rigid republican, he was reputed a con&s;cientious man, and
a good officer. He had received &s;ome encouragement to
come over, and probably would have been employed, had
not the Commons interpo&s;ed. Sir Edward Seymour,
who enjoyed by grant an e&s;tate in Wilt&s;hire, which had
formerly belonged to Ludlow, began to be in pain for his
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He ob&s;erved in the Hou&s;e, that the nation
would be di&s;graced, &s;hould one of the parricides be &s;uf|fered
to live in the kingdom. An addre&s;s was immedi|ately
pre&s;ented to the King, de&s;iring a proclamation might
be i&s;&s;ued, promi&s;ing a reward for apprehending General
Ludlow. This was accordingly publi&s;hed; but not before
he had landed in Holland, from whence he returned to
Vevay in Swi&s;&s;erland, where he wrote the memoirs of his
life, and died after an exile of thirty years.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. While King William fluctuated between two
parties in England, his intere&s;t in Scotland had well nigh
given way to a coalition between the original Jacobite$
and Montgomery's party of di&s;contented pre&s;byterians
Colonel Cannon, who &s;ucceeded the Vi&s;count Dundee i$
command, after having made &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful effort$
in favour of the late King's intere&s;t, retired into Ireland
and the Higlanders cho&s;e Sir Hugh Cameron for their
leader. Under him they renewed their incur&s;ions wit$
the better pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, as &s;everal regiments of th$
regular troops had been &s;ent to re-enforce the army o$
<PB N="75" REF="79">
Schomberg. James a&s;&s;i&s;ted them with clothes, arms, and
$mmunition, together with &s;ome officers, among&s;t whom
was Colonel Buchan, appointed to act as their chief com|mander.
This officer, at the head of fifteen hundred men,
advanced into the &s;hire of Murray, in hope of being joined
by other malcontents: but he was &s;urpri&s;ed and routed
by Sir Thomas Living&s;tone, while Major Fergu&s;on de|&s;troyed
the places they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the I&s;le of Mull; &s;o
that the Highlanders were obliged to retire, and conceal
them&s;elves among their hills and fa&s;tne&s;&s;es. The friends
of James, de&s;pairing of doing any thing effectual for his
&s;ervice in the field, converted all their attention to the
proceedings in parliament, where they imagined their in|tere&s;t
was much &s;tronger than it appeared to be upon trial.
They took the oaths without he&s;itation, and hoped by the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their new allies, to embroil the government in
&s;uch a manner that the majority of the people would de|clare
for a re&s;toration. But the views of the&s;e new
cemented parties were altogether incompatible; and their
principles diametrically oppo&s;ite. Notwith&s;tanding their
concurrence in parliament, the Earl of Melvil procured a
&s;mall majority. The oppo&s;ition was immediately di&s;|couraged:
&s;ome individuals retracted, rather than fall
with a &s;inking cau&s;e; and mutual jealou&s;ies began to
prevail. The leaders of the coalition treated &s;eparately
with King James; made incon&s;i&s;tent demands; recipro|cally
concealed their negociations: in a word, they
di&s;tru&s;ted, and hated one another with the mo&s;t impla|cable
re&s;entment.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. The Earls of Argyle, Annandale, and Braidal|bin
withdrew from their councils, and repaired to Eng|land.
Montgomery, terrified at their defection, went
privately to London, after he had hinted &s;omething of the
plot to Melvil, and &s;ollicited a pa&s;s from the Queen,
which was refu&s;ed. Annandale, having received infor|mation
that Montgomery had di&s;clo&s;ed all the particulars
of the negociation, threw him&s;elf upon the Queen's mercy,
and di&s;covered all he knew of the con&s;piracy. As he had
<PB N="76" REF="80">
not treated with any of the malcontents in England
they remained &s;ecure from his evidence; but, he informe$
again&s;t Nevil Payne, who had been &s;ent down as thei$
agent to Scotland, where he now re&s;ided. He was imme+diately
apprehended by the council of that kingdom, $word$
con&s;equence of a letter from the Earl of Nottingham
and twice put to the torture, which he re&s;olutely bor$
without di&s;covering his employers. Montgomery $word$
ab&s;conded in London, &s;olliciting a pardon; but, findin$
he could not obtain it, except on condition of making
full di&s;covery, he abandoned his country, and cho&s;e to di$
in exile, rather than betray his confederates. This di$
union of the con&s;pirators, and di&s;covery of the plot, le$
the Earl of Melvil in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a greater majority
though even this he was fain to &s;ecure by over&s;trainin$
his in&s;tructions in the articles of patronage, and the
$$premacy of the crown, which he yielded up to the fury $word$
the fanatick pre&s;byterians, contrary to the intention $word$
King William. In lieu of the&s;e, however, they indulge$
him with the tax of chimney or hearth-money; as we
as with a te&s;t to be impo&s;ed upon all per&s;ons in office an$
parliament, declaring William and Mary their law$$
&s;overeigns, and renouncing the pretended title of Ki$$
James. All the laws in favour of epi&s;copacy were r|pealed.
Three&s;core of the pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters, wl$
had been ejected at the Re&s;toration, were &s;till alive; a$
the&s;e the parliament declared the only &s;ound part of $word$
church. The government of it was lodged in the
hands; and they were empowered to admit &s;uch as th$$
&s;hould think proper, to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. A few furio$
fanaticks being thus a&s;&s;ociated, proceeded with ungover$
able violence to per&s;ecute the epi&s;copal party, exerci&s;u$
the very &s;ame tyranny again&s;t which they them&s;elves $word$
&s;o loudly exclaimed.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. While the pre&s;byterian intere&s;t thus
$$$umphed in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1690.</NOTE> the two parties that divided En$land
employed their whole influence and attention
managing the elections for a new parliament; and $word$
<PB N="77" REF="81">
Tories obtained the victory.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. II. 1690.</NOTE> The King &s;eemed gradually
$lling into the arms of this party. They complained of
their having been totally excluded from the Lieutenancy
of London at the King's acce&s;&s;ion to the crown; and now
a con&s;iderable number of the mo&s;t violent Tories in the
city were admitted into the commi&s;&s;ion by the intere&s;t and
addre&s;s of the Bi&s;hop of London, the Marquis of Caer|marthen,
and the Earl of Nottingham. To gratify that
party, the Earls of Monmouth and Warrington were di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
from their employments: nay, when the parliament
met on the twentieth day of March, the Commons cho&s;e
for their Speaker Sir John Trevor, a violent parti&s;an of
that faction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Belcarres. Kennet. Tindal. Ralph.</NOTE> who had been created Ma&s;ter of the Rolls by
the late King. He was a bold, artful man, and under|took
to procure a majority to be at the devotion of the
court, provided he &s;hould be &s;upplied with the nece&s;&s;ary
&s;ums for the purpo&s;es of corruption. William, finding
there was no other way of maintaining his admini&s;tration
in peace, thought proper to countenance the practice of
purcha&s;ing votes, and appointed Trevor fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner
of the great &s;eal. In his &s;peech to the new parliament, he
gave them to under&s;tand, that he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;o|lution
of going in per&s;on to Ireland. He de&s;ired they
would make a &s;ettlement of the revenue, or e&s;tabli&s;h it for
the pre&s;ent, as a fund of credit, upon which the nece&s;|&s;ary
&s;ums for the &s;ervice of the government might be
immediately advanced: he &s;ignified his intention of &s;end|ing
to them an act of grace, with a few exceptions, that
$he might manife&s;t his readine&s;s to extend his protection to
all his &s;ubjects, and leave no colour of excu&s;e for rai&s;ing
di&s;turbances in his ab&s;ence, as he knew how bu&s;y &s;ome
$ll-affected men were in their endeavours to alter the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
government: he recommended an union with
Scotland, the parliament of which had appointed com|mi&s;&s;ioners
for that purpo&s;e: he told them he &s;hould leave
the admini&s;tration in the hands of the Queen, and de&s;ired
they would prepare an act to confirm her authority: he
exhorted them to di&s;patch the bu&s;ine&s;s for which they
<PB N="78" REF="82">
were a&s;&s;embled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1690.</NOTE> to avoid debates, and expre&s;&s;ed his hope
that they &s;hould &s;oon meet again, to fini&s;h what might be
now left imperfect.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. The Commons, in compliance with his re|que&s;t,
voted a &s;upply of twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds,
one million of that &s;um to be rai&s;ed by a clau&s;e of credit
in the revenue-bills; but he could not prevail upon them
to &s;ettle the revenue for life. They granted, however,
the hereditary exci&s;e for that term, but the cu&s;toms for
four years only. They con&s;idered this &s;hort term as the
be&s;t &s;ecurity the kingdom could have for frequent parlia|ments;
though this precaution was not at all agreeable to
their &s;overeign. A poll-bill was likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed; other
&s;upplies were granted, and both parties &s;eemed to court
his Maje&s;ty, by advancing money on tho&s;e funds of credit.
The Whigs, however, had another battery in re&s;erve$
They produced, in the Upper Hou&s;e, a bill for recog|nizing
their Maje&s;ties as the rightful and lawful &s;overeign$
of the&s;e realms, and for declaring all the acts of the la&s;t
parliament to be good and valid. The Tories were now
reduced to a very perplexed &s;ituation. They could no$
oppo&s;e the bill without hazarding the intere&s;t they had &s;$
lately acquired, nor a&s;&s;ent to it without &s;olemnly re|nouncing
their former arguments and di&s;tinctions. They
made no great objections to the fir&s;t part, and even pro+po&s;ed
to enact, That tho&s;e &s;hould be deemed good law$
for the time to come: but they refu&s;ed to declare the$
valid for that which was pa&s;t. After a long debate, th$
bill was committed; yet the Whigs lo&s;t their majority o$
the report: neverthele&s;s, the bill was recovered, an$
pa&s;&s;ed with &s;ome alteration in the words, in con&s;equenc$
of a nervous, &s;pirited prote&s;t, &s;igned Bolton, Maccles field
Stamford, Newport, Bedford, Herbert, Suffolk, Mon
mouth, Delamere, and Oxford. The whole intere&s;t o$
the court was thrown into the &s;cale with this bill, befor$
it would preponderate again&s;t the Tories, the chiefs o$
whom, with the Earl of Nottingham at their head, pro+te&s;ted
in their turn. The &s;ame party in the Hou&s;e o$
<PB N="79" REF="83">
Commons were determined upon a vigorous oppo&s;ition;
and in the mean time &s;ome trifling objections were made,
that it might be committed for amendment; but their
de&s;ign was prematurely di&s;covered by one of their faction,
who chanced to que&s;tion the legality of the convention, as
it was not &s;ummoned by the King's writ. This in&s;inua|tion
was an&s;wered by Somers, the Solicitor-General, who
ob&s;erved, that if it was not a legal parliament, they who
were then met, and who had taken the oaths enacted by
that parliament, were guilty of high-trea&s;on: the laws
repealed by it were &s;till in force: it was their duty, there|fore,
to return to King James; and all concerned in
collecting and paying the money levied by the acts of that
parliament were highly criminal. The Tories were &s;o
&s;truck with the&s;e arguments, that the bill pa&s;&s;ed without
further oppo&s;ition, and immediately received the royal
a&s;&s;ent. Thus the &s;ettlement was confirmed by tho&s;e very
people who had &s;o loudly exclaimed again&s;t it as illegal:
but the Whigs, with all their management, would not
have gained their point, had not the court been intere&s;ted
in the di&s;pute.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. There was another violent conte&s;t between
the two parties, on the import of a bill requiring all &s;ub|jects
in office to abjure King James, on pain of impri&s;on|ment.
Though the clergy were at fir&s;t exempted from
this te&s;t, the main body of the Tories oppo&s;ed it with
great vehemence; while the Whigs, under countenance
of the mini&s;try, &s;upported it with equal vigour. It pro|duced
long and violent debates; and the two factions
&s;eemed pretty equally balanced. At length, the Tories
repre&s;ented to the King, that a great deal of precious
time would be lo&s;t in fruitle&s;s altercation: that tho&s;e who
declared again&s;t the bill would grow &s;ullen and intracta|ble,
&s;o as to oppo&s;e every other motion that might be
made for the King's &s;ervice: that, in ca&s;e of its being
carried, his Maje&s;ty mu&s;t fall again into the hands of the
Whigs, who would renew their former practices again&s;t
the prerogative; and many individuals, who were now
<PB N="80" REF="84">
either well affected to him, or at lea&s;t neutral, would be|come
Jacobites from re&s;entment. The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions had
&s;uch weight with King William, that he &s;ent an inti|mation
to the Commons, de&s;iring they would drop the
debate, and proceed to matters that were more pre&s;&s;ing.
The Whigs in general were di&s;gu&s;ted at this interpo&s;ition;
and the Earl of Shrew&s;bury, who had intere&s;ted him&s;elf
warmly in behalf of the bill, re&s;ented it &s;o deeply, that he
in&s;i&s;ted on re&s;igning his office of Secretary of State. The
King, who revered his talents and integrity, employed
Dr. Tillot&s;on and others, who were &s;uppo&s;ed to have
credit with the Earl, to di&s;&s;uade him from quitting his
employment: but, he continued deaf to all their re|mon&s;trances,
and would not even comply with the reque&s;t
of his Maje&s;ty, who pre&s;&s;ed him to keep the &s;eals until he
&s;hould return from Ireland. Long debates were likewi&s;e
managed in the Hou&s;e of Lords, upon the bill of abju|ration,
or rather an oath of &s;pecial fidelity to William, in
oppo&s;ition to James. The Tories profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves
willing to enter into a negative engagement again&s;t the
late King and his adherents: but they oppo&s;ed the oath
of abjuration with all their might; and the Hou&s;e was &s;o
equally divided that neither &s;ide was willing to hazard a
deci&s;ion: &s;o that all the fruit of their debates was a pro|longation
of the &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. An act was prepared for inve&s;ting the Queen
with the admini&s;tration during the King's ab&s;ence; ano|ther
for rever&s;ing the judgment on a <HI>Quo Warranto</HI> again&s;t
the city of London, and re&s;toring it to its ancient rights

On the twenty-fir&s;t day of May, the King clo&s;ed the
<PB N="81" REF="85">
&s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;hort &s;peech, in which he thanked them
for the &s;upplies they had granted; and recommended to
them a punctual di&s;charge of their duties in their re&s;pec|tive
counties, that the peace of the nation might not be
interrupted in his ab&s;ence. The Hou&s;es were adjourned
to the &s;eventh day of July; when the parliament was pro|rogued
and adjourned &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. As a further &s;ecurity
for the peace of the kingdom, the deputy-lieutenants were
authori&s;ed to rai&s;e the militia in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. All
papi&s;ts were prohibited to &s;tir above five miles from their
re&s;pective places of abode: a proclamation was publi&s;hed
for apprehending certain di&s;affected per&s;ons: Sir John
Cochran and Fergu&s;on were actually arre&s;ted, on &s;u&s;picion
of trea&s;onable practices. On the fourth day of June the
King &s;et out for Ireland, attended by Prince George of
Denmark, the Duke of Ormond, the Earls of Oxford,
Scarborough, Manche&s;ter, and many other per&s;ons of
di&s;tinction: on the fourteenth day of the month he landed
at Carrickfergus, from whence he immediately proceeded
to Belfa&s;t, where he was met by the Duke of Schomberg,
the Prince of Wirtemberg, Major-General Kirke, and
other officers. By this time, Col. Wol&s;ey, at the head
of a thou&s;and men, had defeated a &s;trong detachment of
the enemy near Belturbat: Sir John Lanier had taken
Bedloe-ca&s;tle; and that of Charlemont, a &s;trong po&s;t of
great importance, together with Balingargy, near Cavan,
had been reduced. King William having repo&s;ed him&s;elf
for two or three days at Belfa&s;t, vi&s;ited the Duke's head|quarters
at Li&s;burne: then advancing to Hill&s;borough,
publi&s;hed an order again&s;t pre&s;&s;ing hor&s;es, and commit|ting
violence on the country people. When &s;ome of his
general officers propo&s;ed cautious mea&s;ures, he declared
$he did not come to Ireland to let the gra&s;s grow under his
<PB N="82" REF="86">
feet. He ordered the army to encamp and be reviewed
at Loughbrilland, where he found it amount to &s;ix-and-|thirty
thou&s;and effective men well appointed. Then he
marched to Dundalk; and afterwards advanced to Ar|dee,
which the enemy had ju&s;t abandoned.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. King James tru&s;ted &s;o much to the di&s;putes
in the Engli&s;h parliament, that he did not believe his &s;on-|in-law
would be able to quit that kingdom; and William
had been &s;ix days in Ireland before he received intimation
of his arrival. This was no &s;ooner known, than he left
Dublin under the guard of the militia commanded by
Luttrell, and with a re-enforcement of &s;ix-thou&s;and in|fantry,
which he had lately received from France, joined
the re&s;t of his forces, which now almo&s;t equalled Wil|liam's
army in number, exclu&s;ive of about fifteen thou|&s;and
men who remained in different garri&s;ons. He occu|pied
a very advantageous po&s;t on the bank of the Boyne,
and, contrary to the advice of his general officers, re&s;olved
to &s;tand battle. They propo&s;ed to &s;trengthen their garri|&s;ons,
and retire to the Shannon, to wait the effect of the
operations at &s;ea. Louis had promi&s;ed to equip a powerful
armament again&s;t the Engli&s;h fleet, and &s;end over a great
number of &s;mall frigates to de&s;troy William's tran&s;ports,
as &s;oon as their convoy &s;hould be returned to England.
The execution of this &s;cheme was not at all difficult, and
mu&s;t have proved fatal to the Engli&s;h army; for their
&s;tores and ammunition were &s;till on board; the &s;hips
&s;ailed along the coa&s;t as the troops advanced in their
march; and there was not one &s;ecure harbour into which
they could retire on any emergency. James, however,
was bent upon hazarding an engagement; and expre&s;&s;ed
uncommon confidence and alacrity. Be&s;ides the river,
which was deep, his front was &s;ecured by a mora&s;s and
a ri&s;ing ground: &s;o that the Engli&s;h army could not at|tack
him without manife&s;t di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. King William marched up to the oppo&s;ite
bank of the river, and, as he reconnoitred their &s;ituation,
was expo&s;ed to the &s;ire of &s;ome field-pieces, which the
<PB N="83" REF="87">
enemy purpo&s;ely planted again&s;t his per&s;on. They killed
a man and two hor&s;es clo&s;e by him; and the &s;econd bul|let
rebounding from the earth, grazed upon his right
&s;houlder, &s;o as to carry off part of his clothes and &s;kin,
and produce a con&s;iderable contu&s;ion. This accident,
which he bore without the lea&s;t emotion, created &s;ome
confu&s;ion among his attendants, which the enemy per|ceiving,
concluded he was killed, and &s;houted aloud in
token of their joy. Their whole camp re&s;ounded with
acclamation; and &s;everal &s;quadrons of their hor&s;e were
drawn down towards the river, as if they had intended to
pa&s;s it immediately, and attack the Engli&s;h army. The
report was in&s;tantly communicated from place to place,
until it reached Dublin; from thence it was conveyed to
Paris, where, contrary to the cu&s;tom of the French court,
the people were encouraged to celebrate the event with
bonfires and illuminations. William rode along the line
to &s;hew him&s;elf to the army after this narrow e&s;cape. At
night he called a council of war; and declared his re&s;o|lution
to attack the enemy in the morning. Schomberg
at fir&s;t oppo&s;ed this de&s;ign: but finding the King deter|mined,
he advi&s;ed that a &s;trong detachment of hor&s;e and
foot &s;hould that night pa&s;s the Boyne at Slane-bridge, and
take po&s;t between the enemy and the pa&s;s of Duleck, that
the action might be the more deci&s;ive. This coun&s;el
being rejected, the King determined, that, early in the
morning, Lieutenant-General Douglas, with the right
wing of infantry, and young Schomberg, with the hor&s;e,
&s;hould pa&s;s at Slane-bridge, while the main body of foot
&s;hould force their pa&s;&s;age at Old-bridge, and the left at
certain fords between the enemy's camp and Drogheda.
The Duke, perceiving his advice was not reli&s;hed by the
Dutch Generals, retired to his tent, where the order of
battle being brought to him, he received it with an air of
di&s;content, &s;aying, it was the fir&s;t that had ever been &s;ent
him in that manner. The proper di&s;po&s;itions being made,
William rode quite thro' the army by torch-light, and then
retired to his tent, after having given orders for the &s;oldiers
<PB N="84" REF="88">
to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from the enemy by wearing
green boughs in their hats during the action.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. At &s;ix o'clock in the morning, General
Douglas, with young Schomberg, the Earl of Portland, and
Auverquerque, marched towards Slane-bridge, and pa&s;&s;ed
the river with very little oppo&s;ition. When they reached
the farther bank, they perceived the enemy drawn up in
two lines, to a con&s;iderable number of hor&s;e and foot,
with a mora&s;s in their front; &s;o that Douglas was obliged
to wait for a re-enforcement. This being arrived, th$
infantry were led on to the charge through the mora&s;s
while Count Schomberg rode round it with his cavalry
to attack the enemy in flank. The Iri&s;h, in&s;tead of wait+ing
the a&s;&s;ault, faced about, and retreated towards Dulec$
with &s;ome precipitation; yet not &s;o fa&s;t, but that Schom+berg
fell in among their rear, and did con&s;iderable exe+cution.
King James, however, &s;oon re-enforced his le$
wing from the centre; and the Count was in his tur$
obliged to &s;end for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. At this juncture, Kin$
William's main-body, con&s;i&s;ting of the Dutch-guards, th$
French regiments, and &s;ome battalions of Engli&s;h, pa&s;&s;e$
the river, which was wai&s;t high, under a general di&s;charg$
of artillery. King James had imprudently removed $word$
cannon from the other &s;ide; but he had po&s;ted a &s;tron$
body of mu&s;queteers along the bank, behind hedge
hou&s;es, and &s;ome works rai&s;ed for the occa&s;ion. The
poured in a clo&s;e fire upon the Engli&s;h troops before th$
reached the &s;hore; but it produced very little effect: th$
the Iri&s;h gave way; and &s;ome battalions landed witho$
further oppo&s;ition. Yet, before they could form, they we
charged with great impetuo&s;ity by a &s;quadron of the en$my's
hor&s;e; and a con&s;iderable body of their cavalry $word$
foot, commanded by General Hamilton, advanced fro$
behind &s;ome little hillocks, to attack tho&s;e that we
landed, as well as to prevent the re&s;t from reaching $word$
&s;hore. His infantry turned their backs and &s;led
$$mediately; but, the hor&s;e charged with incredible $word$
both upon the bank and in the river, &s;o as to put $word$
<PB N="85" REF="89">
unformed regiments in confu&s;ion. Then the Duke of
Schomberg pa&s;&s;ing the river in per&s;on, put him&s;elf at the
head of the French prote&s;tants, and pointing to the enemy,
&startq;Gentlemen (&s;aid he) tho&s;e are your per&s;ecutors;&endq; with
the&s;e words he advanced to the attack, where he him&s;elf
&s;u&s;tained a violent on&s;et from a party of the Iri&s;h hor&s;e,
which had broke through one of the regiments, and were
now on their return. They were mi&s;taken for Engli&s;h,
and allowed to gallop up to the Duke, who received two
&s;evere wounds in the head: but the French regiments
being now &s;en&s;ible of their mi&s;take, ra&s;hly threw in their
fire upon the Iri&s;h while they were engaged with the
Duke; and, in&s;tead of &s;aving, &s;hot him dead upon the &s;pot.
The fate of this general had well nigh proved fatal to the
Engli&s;h army, which was immediately involved in tumult
and di&s;order; while the infantry of King James rallied,
and returned to their po&s;ts with the face of re&s;olution.
They were ju&s;t ready to fall upon the centre, when King
William having pa&s;&s;ed with the left wing, compo&s;ed of
the Dani&s;h, Dutch, and Inni&s;killin hor&s;e, advanced to
attack them on the right. They were &s;truck with &s;uch a
panick at his appearance, that they made a &s;udden halt,
and then facing about, retreated to the village of Dunore.
There they made &s;uch a vigorous &s;tand, that the Dutch
and Dani&s;h hor&s;e, though headed by the King in per&s;on,
recoiled; even the Inni&s;killiners gave way; and the whole
wing would have been routed, had not a detachment of
dragoons, belonging to the regiments of Cunningham and
Levi&s;on, di&s;mounted, and lined the hedges on each &s;ide of
the defile through which the fugitives were driven. There
they did &s;uch execution upon the pur&s;uers, as &s;oon
checked their ardour. The hor&s;e, which were broken,
had now time to rally, and, returning to the charge, drove
the enemy before them in their turn. In this action Gene|ral
Hamilton, who had been the life and &s;oul of the Iri&s;h
during the whole engagement, was wounded and taken;
an incident which di&s;couraged them to &s;uch a degree, that
they made no further efforts to retrieve the advantage they
<PB N="86" REF="90">
had lo&s;t. He was immediately brought to the King, who
a&s;ked him if he thought the Iri&s;h would make any further
re&s;i&s;tance? and he replied, &startq;Upon my honour, I believe
they will; for they have &s;till a good body of hor&s;e entire.&endq;
William, eying him with a look of di&s;dain, repeated
&startq;Your honour! your honour!&endq; but took no other
notice of his having acted contrary to his engagement,
when he was permitted to go to Ireland, on promi&s;e of
per&s;uading Tyrconnel to &s;ubmit to the new government.
The Iri&s;h now abandoned the field with precipitation;
but the French and Swi&s;s troops, that acted as their
auxiliaries, under Lauzun, retreated in good order, after
having maintained the battle for &s;ome time with intre|pidity
and per&s;everance.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. As King William did not think proper to
pur&s;ue the enemy the carnage was not great. The Iri&s;h
lo&s;t fifteen hundred men, and the Engli&s;h about one third
of that number; though the victory was dearly purcha&s;ed,
con&s;idering the death of the gallant Duke of Schomberg,
who fell in the eighty-&s;econd year of his age, after having
rivalled the be&s;t generals of the time in military reputation.
He was de&s;cended of a noble family in the Palatinate, and
his mother was an Engli&s;h woman, daughter of Lord
Dudley. Being obliged to leave his country on account
of the troubles by which it was agitated, he commenced a
&s;oldier of fortune, and &s;erved &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the armies of
Holland, England, France, Portugal, and Brandenburgh.
He attained to the dignities of mare&s;chal in France,
grandee in Portugal, generali&s;&s;imo in Pru&s;&s;ia, and duke
in England. He profe&s;&s;ed the prote&s;tant religion; was
courteous and humble in his deportment; cool, pene|trating,
re&s;olute, and &s;agacious; nor was his probity
inferior to his courage. This battle likewi&s;e proved fatal
to the brave Caillemote, who had followed the Duke's
fortunes, and commanded one of the prote&s;tant regiments.
After having received a mortal wound, he was carried
back through the river by four &s;oldiers, and though almo&s;t
in the agonies of death, he with a chearful countenance
<PB N="87" REF="91">
encouraged tho&s;e who were cro&s;&s;ing to do their duty,
exclaiming, &startq;<HI>A la gloire, mes enfans; &agrave; la gloire!</HI> To
glory, my lads; to glory!&endq; The third remarkable per&s;on
who lo&s;t his life on this occa&s;ion, was Walker the clergy|man,
who had &s;o valiantly defended Londonderry again&s;t
the whole army of King James. He had been very gra|ciou&s;ly
received by King William, who gratified him with
a reward of five thou&s;and pounds, and a promi&s;e of further
favour; but, his military genius &s;till predominating, he
attended his royal patron in this battle, and, being &s;hot
in the belly, died in a few minutes. The per&s;ons of
di&s;tinction who fell on the other &s;ide were the Lords
Dongan and Carlingford, Sir Neile O Neile, and the
Marquis of Hocquincourt. James him&s;elf &s;tood aloof
during the action, on the hill of Dunmore, &s;urrounded
with &s;ome &s;quadrons of hor&s;e; and &s;eeing victory declare
again&s;t him, retired to Dublin, without having made the
lea&s;t effort to re-a&s;&s;emble his broken forces. Had he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed either &s;pirit or conduct, his army might have
been rallied, and re-enforced from his garri&s;ons, &s;o as to
be in a condition to keep the field, and even act upon the
offen&s;ive; for his lo&s;s was incon&s;iderable, and the victor
did not attempt to mole&s;t his troops in their retreat&mdash;an
omi&s;&s;ion which has been charged upon him as a flagrant
in&s;tance of mi&s;conduct. Indeed, through the whole of
this engagement, William's per&s;onal courage was much
more con&s;picuous than his military &s;kill.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. King James no &s;ooner arrived at Dublin,
than he a&s;&s;embled the magi&s;trates and council of the city,
and in a &s;hort &s;peech re&s;igned them to the fortune of the
victor. He complained of the cowardice of the Iri&s;h;
&s;ignified his re&s;olution of leaving the kingdom imme|diately;
forbad them, on their allegiance, to burn or
plunder the city after his departure; and a&s;&s;ured them,
that, though he was obliged to yield to force, he would
never cea&s;e to labour for their deliverance. Next day he
&s;et out for Waterford, attended by the Duke of Berwick,
Tyrconnel, and the Marquis of Powis. He ordered all
<PB N="88" REF="92">
the bridges to be broken down behind him, and embarked
in a ve&s;&s;el which had been prepared for his reception. At
&s;ea he fell in with the French &s;quadron, commanded by
the Sieur de Foran, who per&s;uaded him to go on board
one of his frigates, which was a prime &s;ailor. In this he
was &s;afely conveyed to France, and returned to the place
of his former re&s;idence at St. Germain's. He had no
&s;ooner quitted Dublin, than it was al&s;o abandoned by
all the papi&s;ts. The prote&s;tants immediately took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the arms belonging to the militia, under the
conduct of the Bi&s;hops of Meath and Limerick. A com|mittee
was formed to take charge of the admini&s;tration;
and an account of the&s;e tran&s;actions was tran&s;mitted to
King William, together with a petition, that he would
honour the city with his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. On the morning after the battle of the Boyne,
William &s;ent a detachment of hor&s;e and foot, under the
command of M. Mellionere, to Drogheda, the governor
of which &s;urrendered the place without oppo&s;ition. The
King, at the head of the army, began his march for
Dublin, and halted the fir&s;t night at Bally-Breghan,
where, having received advice of the enemy's retreat from
the capital, he &s;ent the Duke of Ormond, with a body
of hor&s;e, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The&s;e were immediately
followed by the Dutch guards, who &s;ecured the ca&s;tle. In
a few days the King encamped at Finglas, in the neigh|bourhood
of Dublin, where he was vi&s;ited by the Bi&s;hops
of Meath and Limerick, at the head of the prote&s;tant
clergy, whom he a&s;&s;ured of his favour and protection.
Then he publi&s;hed a declaration of pardon to all the
common people who had &s;erved again&s;t him, provided they
&s;hould return to their dwellings, and &s;urrender their arms
by the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t. Tho&s;e that rented lands of
popi&s;h proprietors who had been concerned in the rebel|lion
were required to retain their rents in their own hands,
until they &s;hould have notice from the commi&s;&s;ioners of
the revenue to whom they &s;hould be paid. The de&s;perate
leaders of the rebellion, who had violated the laws of the
<PB N="89" REF="93">
kingdom, called in the French, authori&s;ed the depreda|tions
which had been committed upon prote&s;tants, and
rejected the pardon offered to them on the King's fir&s;t pro|clamation,
were left to the event of war, unle&s;s by evident
demon&s;trations of repentance they &s;hould de&s;erve mercy,
which would never be refu&s;ed to tho&s;e who were truely
penitent. The next &s;tep taken by King William was to
i&s;&s;ue a proclamation, reducing the bra&s;s money to nearly
its intrin&s;ick value. In the mean time, the principal
officers in the army of James, after having &s;een him em|bark
at Waterford, returned to their troops, determined
to pro&s;ecute the war as long as they could be &s;upplied with
means to &s;upport their operations.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the Queen, as
regent, found her&s;elf &s;urrounded with numberle&s;s cares
and perplexities. Her council was pretty equally divided
into Whigs and Tories, who did not always act with una|nimity.
She was di&s;tracted between her apprehen&s;ions
for her father's &s;afety and her hu&s;band's life: &s;he was
threatened with an inva&s;ion by the French from abroad,
and with an in&s;urrection by the Jacobites at home. Never|thele&s;s,
&s;he di&s;gui&s;ed her fears, and behaved with equal
prudence and fortitude. Advice being received that a fleet
was ready to &s;ail from Bre&s;t, Lord Torrington hoi&s;ted his
flag in the Downs, and &s;ailed round to St. Helen's, in
order to a&s;&s;emble &s;uch a number of &s;hips as would enable
him to give them battle. The enemy being di&s;covered
off Plymouth, on the twentieth day of June, the Engli&s;h
Admiral, re-enforced with a Dutch &s;quadron, &s;tood out
to &s;ea, with a view to intercept them at the back of the
I&s;le of Wight, &s;hould they pre&s;ume to &s;ail up the channel:
not that he thought him&s;elf &s;trong enough to cope with
them in battle. Their fleet con&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventy-eight &s;hips
of war, and two-and-twenty fire&s;hips; whereas, the com|bined
&s;quadrons of England and Holland did not exceed
&s;ix-and-fifty; but he had received orders to hazard an
engagement, if he thought it might be done with any
pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. After the ho&s;tile fleets had continued
five days in &s;ight of each other, Lord Torrington bore
<PB N="90" REF="94">
down upon the enemy off Beachy-head, on the thirtieth
day of June, at day-break. The Dutch &s;quadron, which
compo&s;ed the van, began the engagement about nine in
the morning: in about half an hour the blue divi&s;ion of
the Engli&s;h were clo&s;e engaged with the rear of the French;
but the red, which formed the centre, under the command
of Torrington in per&s;on, did not fill the line till ten
o'clock, &s;o that the Dutch were almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the
enemy, and, though they fought with great valour, &s;u|&s;tained
con&s;iderable damage. At length, the Admiral's
divi&s;ion drove between them and the French, and in that
&s;ituation the fleet anchored about five in the afternoon,
when the action was interrupted by a calm. The Dutch
had &s;uffered &s;o &s;everely, that Torrington thought it would
be imprudent to renew the battle; he, therefore, weighed
anchor in the night, and with the tide of flood retired to
the ea&s;tward. The next day the di&s;abled &s;hips were de|&s;troyed,
that they might not be retarded in their retreat.
They were pur&s;ued as far as Rye: an Engli&s;h &s;hip of
&s;eventy guns being &s;tranded near Winchel&s;ea, was &s;et on
fire, and de&s;erted, by the captain's command. A Dutch
&s;hip of &s;ixty-four guns met with the &s;ame accident, and
&s;ome French frigates attempted to burn her; but the
captain defended her &s;o vigorou&s;ly that they were obliged
to de&s;i&s;t, and he afterwards found means to carry her &s;afe
to Holland. In this engagement the Engli&s;h lo&s;t two
&s;hips, two &s;ea-captains, and about four hundred men;
but the Dutch were more unfortunate. Six of their great
&s;hips were de&s;troyed; Dick and Brackel, rear admirals,
were &s;lain, together with a great number of inferior officers
and &s;eamen. Torrington retreated without further inter|ruption
into the mouth of the Thames, and, having taker
precautions again&s;t any attempts of the enemy in that
quarter, returned to London, the inhabitants of whic$
were overwhelmed with con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. The government was infected with th$
&s;ame panick. The mini&s;try pretended to believe that th$
French acted in concert with the malcontents of the nation
<PB N="91" REF="95">
that in&s;urrections in different parts of the kingdom had
been projected by the Jacobites; and that there would be
general revolt in Scotland. The&s;e in&s;inuations were
circulated by the court-agents, in order to ju&s;tify, in the
opinion of the publick, the mea&s;ures that were deemed
nece&s;&s;ary at this juncture; and they produced the de&s;ired
effect. The apprehen&s;ions thus artfully rai&s;ed among the
people inflamed their aver&s;ion to nonjurors and Jacobites.
Addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented to the Queen by the Corni&s;h
$inners, by the lieutenancy of Middle&s;ex, and by the
Mayor, Aldermen, and Lieutenancy of London, filled
with profe&s;&s;ions of loyalty, and promi&s;es of &s;upporting
their Maje&s;ties, as their lawful &s;overeigns, again&s;t all
oppo&s;ition. The Queen, at this cri&s;is, exhibited remark|able
proofs of courage, activity, and di&s;cretion. She i&s;&s;ued
out proper orders and directions for putting the nation in a
po&s;ture of defence, as well as for refitting and augmenting
the fleet: &s;he took mea&s;ures for appea&s;ing the re&s;ent|ment
of the States-General, who exclaimed again&s;t the
Earl of Torrington for his behaviour in the late action.
He was deprived of his command, and &s;ent pri&s;oner to the
Tower: and commi&s;&s;ioners were appointed, to examine
the particular circum&s;tances of his conduct. A camp was
formed in the neighbourhood of Torbay, where the French
&s;eemed to threaten a de&s;cent. Their fleet, which lay at
anchor in the bay, cannonaded a &s;mall village called
Tingmouth. About a thou&s;and of their men landed
without oppo&s;ition, &s;et fire to the place, and burned a few
coa&s;ting ve&s;&s;els: then they re-embarked, and returned to
Bre&s;t, &s;o vain of this atchievement, that they printed a
pompous account of their inva&s;ion. Some of the Whig
parti&s;ans publi&s;hed pamphlets, and diffu&s;ed reports, im|plying,
that the &s;u&s;pended bi&s;hops were concerned in the
con&s;piracy again&s;t the government; and the&s;e arts proved
&s;o inflammatory among the common people, that the pre|l$tes
thought it nece&s;&s;ary to print a paper, in which they
a&s;&s;erted their innocence in the mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;tations.
The court &s;eems to have harboured no &s;u&s;picion again&s;t
<PB N="92" REF="96">
them, otherwi&s;e they would not have e&s;caped impri&s;on|ment.
The Queen i&s;&s;ued a proclamation for apprehend|ing
the Earls of Lichfield, Ayle&s;bury, and Ca&s;tlemain;
Vi&s;count Pre&s;ton; the Lords Montgomery and Bella&s;is;
Sir Edward Hales, Sir Robert Tharold, Sir Robert Ha|milton,
Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe, Colonel Edward
Sackville, and &s;ome other officers. The&s;e were accu&s;ed
of having con&s;pired with other di&s;affected per&s;ons to di&s;turb
and de&s;troy the government, and of a de&s;ign to concur
with her Maje&s;ty's enemies in the intended inva&s;ion. The
Earl of Torrington continued a pri&s;oner in the Tower till
next &s;e&s;&s;ion, when he was brought into the Hou&s;e of
Commons, and made a &s;peech in his own defence. His
ca&s;e produced long debates in the Upper Hou&s;e, where
the form of his commitment was judged illegal: at length
he was tried by a court-martial, appointed by the com|mi&s;&s;ioners
of the Admiralty, though not before an act had
pa&s;&s;ed, declaring the power of a lord high-admiral ve&s;ted
in tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners. The pre&s;ident of the court was
Sir Ralph Delaval, who had acted as vice-admiral of the
blue in the engagement. The Earl was acquitted, but
the King di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him from the &s;ervice; and the Dutch
exclaimed again&s;t the partiality of his judges.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. William is &s;aid to have intercepted all the
papers of his father-in-law and Tyrconnel, and to have
learned from them, not only the de&s;ign projected by the
French to burn the Engli&s;h tran&s;ports, but likewi&s;e the
undertaking of one Jones, who engaged to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate King
William. No &s;uch attempt, however, was made, and,
in all probabilty, the whole report was a fiction, calcu|lated
to throw an odium on James's character. On the
ninth day of July William detached General Douglas
with a con&s;iderable body of hor&s;e and foot towards
Athlone, while he him&s;elf, having left Trelawny to com|mand
at Dublin, advanced with the re&s;t of his army to
Inchiquin, in his way to Kilkenny. Colonel Grace, th$
governor of Athlone for King James, being &s;ummoned to
&s;urrender, fired a pi&s;tol at the trumpeter, &s;aying, &startq;The&s;$
<PB N="93" REF="97">
are my terms.&endq; Then Douglas re&s;olved to undertake
the &s;iege of the place, which was naturally very &s;trong,
and defended by a re&s;olute garri&s;on. An incon&s;iderable
breach was made, when Douglas, receiving intelligence
that Sarsfield was on his march to the relief of the be|&s;ieged,
abandoned the enterpri&s;e, after having lo&s;t above
four hundred men in the attempt. The King continued
his march to the we&s;tward; and, by dint of &s;evere exam|ples,
e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch order and di&s;cipline in his army,
that the pea&s;ants were &s;ecure from the lea&s;t violence. At
Carlow he detached the Duke of Ormond to take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of Kilkenny, where that nobleman regaled him in
his own ca&s;tle, which the enemy had left undamaged.
While the army encamped at Carrick, Major-General
Kirke was &s;ent to Waterford, the garri&s;on of which,
con&s;i&s;ting of two regiments, capitulated, upon condition
of marching out with their arms and baggage, and being
conducted to Mallow. The fort of Duncannon was
&s;urrendered on the &s;ame terms. Here the Lord Dover and
the Lord George Howard were admitted to the benefit of
the King's mercy and protection.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. On the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t, William being
at Chapel-Izard, publi&s;hed a &s;econd declaration of mercy,
confirming the former, and even extending it to per&s;ons of
&s;uperior rank and &s;tation, whether natives or foreigners,
provided they would, by the twenty-fifth day of the
month, lay down their arms, and &s;ubmit to certain con|ditions.
This offer of indemnity produced very little
effect; for the Iri&s;h were generally governed by their
prie&s;ts, and the news of the victory which the French
fleet had obtained over the Engli&s;h and Dutch was
circulated with &s;uch exaggerations as elevated their &s;pirits,
and effaced all thoughts of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The King had
returned to Dublin, with a view to embark for England;
but receiving notice that the de&s;igns of his dome&s;tick ene|mies
were di&s;covered and fru&s;trated; that the fleet was
repaired, and the French navy retired to Bre&s;t, he po&s;t|poned
his voyage, and re&s;olved to reduce Limerick, in
<PB N="94" REF="98">
which Mon&s;ieur Boi&s;&s;eleau commanded as governor, and
the Duke of Berwick and Colonel Sarsfield acted as in|ferior
officers. On the ninth day of Augu&s;t, the King
having called in his detachments, and advanced into the
neighbourhood of the place, &s;ummoned the commander
to deliver the town; and Boi&s;&s;eleau an&s;wered, that he
imagined the be&s;t way to gain the good opinion of the
Prince of Orange would be a vigorous defence of the
town which his Maje&s;ty had committed to his charge.
Before the place was fully inve&s;ted, Colonel Sarsfield,
with a body of hor&s;e and dragoons, pa&s;&s;ed the Shannon
in the night, intercepted the King's train of artillery on
its way to the camp, routed the troops that guarded it,
di&s;abled the cannon, de&s;troyed the carriages, waggons,
and ammunition, and returned in &s;afety to Limerick.
Notwith&s;tanding this di&s;a&s;ter, the trenches were opened
on the &s;eventeenth day of the month, and a battery was
rai&s;ed with &s;ome cannon brought from Waterford. The
&s;iege was carried on with vigour, and the place defended
with great re&s;olution. At length, the King ordered his
troops to make a lodgement in the covered way or coun|ter&s;carp,
which was accordingly a&s;&s;aulted with great fury:
but the a&s;&s;ailants met with &s;uch a warm reception from
the be&s;ieged, that they were repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s of
twelve hundred men, either killed on the &s;pot or mortally
wounded. This di&s;appointment concurring with the
badne&s;s of the weather, which became rainy and unwhole|&s;ome,
induced the King to renounce his undertaking.
The heavy baggage and cannon being &s;ent away, the
army decamped, and marched towards Clonmel. William
having con&s;tituted the Lord Sidney and Thomas Co|ning&s;by
lords ju&s;tices of Ireland, and left the command
of the army with Count Solmes, embarked at Duncannon
with Prince George of Denmark, on the fifth of Septem|ber,
and next day arrived in King-Road, near Bri&s;tol,
from whence he repaired to Wind&s;or.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. About the latter end of this month the
Earl of Marlborough arrived in Ireland, with five thou&s;and
<PB N="95" REF="99">
Engli&s;h troops, to attack Cork and Kin&s;ale, in conjunc|tion
with a detachment from the great army, according
to a &s;cheme he had propo&s;ed to King William. Having
landed his &s;oldiers without much oppo&s;ition in the neigh|bourhood
of Cork, he was joined by five thou&s;and men,
under the Prince of Wirtemberg, between whom and the
Earl a di&s;pute aro&s;e about the command; but this was
compromi&s;ed by the interpo&s;ition of La Mellionere. The
place being inve&s;ted, and the batteries rai&s;ed, the be|&s;iegers
proceeded with &s;uch rapidity that a breach was
&s;oon effected. Colonel Mackillicut, the governor, de|manded
a parley, and ho&s;tages were exchanged; but he
rejected the conditions that were offered, and ho&s;tilities
recommenced with redoubled vigour. The Duke of
Grafton, who &s;erved on this occa&s;ion as a volunteer, was
mortally wounded in one of the attacks, and died regretted
as a youth of promi&s;ing talents. Preparations being made
for a general a&s;&s;ault, the be&s;ieged thought proper to capi|tulate,
and &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war. Be|&s;ides
the Governor and Colonel Ricaut, the victor found
the Earls of Clancarty and Tyrone among the individuals
of the garri&s;on. Marlborough having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Cork, detached Brigadier Villiers with a body of hor&s;e
and dragoons to &s;ummon the town and forts of Kin&s;ale,
and next day advanced with the re&s;t of the forces. The
old fort was immediately taken by a&s;&s;ault; but Sir Edward
Scot, who commanded the other, &s;u&s;tained a regular
&s;iege, until the breach was practicable, and then obtained
an honourable capitulation. The&s;e maritime places being
reduced, all communication between France and the
enemy, on this &s;ide of the i&s;land, was cut off, and the
Iri&s;h were confined to Ul&s;ter, where they could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t
without great difficulty. The Earl of Marlborough hav|ing
fini&s;hed this expedition in thirty days, returned with
his pri&s;oners to England, where the fame of this exploit
added greatly to his reputation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Count de
Lauzun, commander of the French auxiliaries in Ireland,
<PB N="96" REF="100">
lay inactive in the neighbourhood of Galway, and tran&s;|mitted
&s;uch a lamentable account of his &s;ituation to the
court of France, that tran&s;ports were &s;ent over, to bring
home the French forces. In the&s;e he embarked with his
troops, and the command of the Iri&s;h forces devolved to
the Duke of Berwick, though it was afterwards tran&s;|ferred
to M. St. Ruth. Lauzun was di&s;graced at Ver|&s;ailles
for having de&s;erted the cau&s;e before it was de&s;perate:
Tyrconnel, who accompanied him in his voyage, &s;olli|cited
the French court for a further &s;upply of officers,
arms, clothes, and ammunition for the Iri&s;h army, which
he &s;aid would continue firm to the intere&s;t of King James,
if thus &s;upported. Mean while, they formed them&s;elves
into &s;eparate bodies of freebooters, and plundered the
country, under the appellation of Rapparies; while the
troops of King William either enjoyed their ea&s;e in
quarters, or imitated the rapine of the enemy; &s;o that,
between both, the poor people were mi&s;erably harra&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. The affairs of the continent had not yet
undergone any change of importance, except in the
conduct of the Duke of Savoy, who renounced his neu|trality,
engaged in an alliance with the emperor and
King of Spain; and, in a word, acceded to the grand
confederacy. He had no &s;ooner declared him&s;elf than
Catinat, the French general, entered his territories, at
the head of eighteen thou&s;and men, and defeated him in a
pitched battle near Saluces, which immediately &s;urren|dered
to the conqueror. Then he reduced Savillana
Villa Franca, with &s;everal other places, pur&s;ued the
Duke to Carignan, &s;urpri&s;ed Suza, and di&s;tributed his
forces in winter-quarters, partly in Provence, and partly
in the duchy of Savoy, which St. Ruth had lately re|duced
under the dominion of France. The Duke finding
him&s;elf di&s;appointed in the &s;uccours he expected from th$
Emperor and King of Spain, demanded a&s;&s;i&s;tance of th$
States-General and King William; to this la&s;t he &s;ent a$
amba&s;&s;ador, to congratulate him upon his acce&s;&s;ion to th$
throne of England. The confederates, in their genera$
<PB N="97" REF="101">
congre&s;s at the Hague, had agreed that the army of the
&s;tates under Prince Waldeck &s;hould oppo&s;e the forces of
France, commanded by the Duke of Luxembourg in
Flanders; while the elector of Brandenburgh &s;hould ob|&s;erve
the Marquis de Boufflers on the Mo&s;elle: but, be|fore
the troops of Brandenburgh could be a&s;&s;embled,
Boufflers encamped between the Sambre and the Meu&s;e,
and maintained a free communication with Luxembourg.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. Prince Waldeck under&s;tanding that this
general intended to cro&s;s the Sambre between Namur and
Charleroy, in order to lay the Spani&s;h territories under
contribution, decamped from the river Pieton, and de|tached
the Count of Berlo, with a great body of hor&s;e,
to ob&s;erve the motions of the enemy. He was encountered
by the French army near Fleurus, and &s;lain; and his
troops, though &s;upported by two other detachments, were
hardly able to rejoin the main body, which continued all
night in order of battle. Next day they were attacked by
the French, who were greatly &s;uperior to them in num|ber:
after a very ob&s;tinate engagement the allies gave way,
leaving about five thou&s;and men dead upon the field of
battle. The enemy took about four thou&s;and pri&s;oners,
and the greate&s;t part of their artillery; but the victory was
dearly bought. The Dutch infantry fought with &s;urpri&s;ing
re&s;olution and &s;ucce&s;s. The Duke of Luxembourg owned,
with &s;urpri&s;e, that they had &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the Spani&s;h foot at
the battle of Rocroy. &startq;Prince Waldeck (&s;aid he) ought
always to remember the French hor&s;e; and I &s;hall ne|ver
forget the Dutch infantry.&endq; The Dutch general
exerted him&s;elf with &s;uch activity, that the French de|rived
very little advantage from their victory. The Prince
being re-enforced with the five Engli&s;h regiments, nine
thou&s;and Hanoverians, ten thou&s;and from the bi&s;hoprick
of Leige and Holland, joined the Elector of Branden|burgh:
&s;o that the confederate army amounted to five-and-fifty
thou&s;and men, and they marched by the way of
Genap to Bois-Seigneur-I&s;aac. They were now &s;uperior
to Luxembourg, who thought proper to fortify his camp,
<PB N="98" REF="102">
that he might not be obliged to fight, except with con&s;i|derable
advantage. Neverthele&s;s, Prince Waldeck would
have attacked him in his entrenchments, had not he been
prohibited from hazarding another engagement, by an
expre&s;s order of the States-General; and, when this re|&s;triction
was removed, the Elector would not venture a
battle.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. By this time the Emperor's &s;on Jo&s;eph was by
the electoral college cho&s;en King of the Romans; but his
intere&s;t &s;u&s;tained a rude &s;hock in the death of the gallant
Duke of Lorraine, who was &s;uddenly &s;ei&s;ed with a quin&s;ey,
at a &s;mall village near Lintz, and expired, not without
&s;u&s;picion of having fallen a &s;acrifice to the fears of the
French King, again&s;t whom he had formerly declared
war, as a &s;overeign prince unju&s;tly expelled from his ter|ritories.
He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great military talents, and had
threatened to enter Lorraine, at the head of forty thou|&s;and
men, in the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing &s;ummer. The
court of France, alarmed at this declaration, is &s;aid to have
had recour&s;e to poi&s;on, for preventing the execution
of the Duke's de&s;ign. At his death the command of the
Imperial army was conferred upon the Elector of Bavaria.
This prince, having joined the Elector of Saxony, ad|vanced
again&s;t the Dauphin, who had pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine
at Fort Louis, with a con&s;iderable army, and intended to
penetrate into Wirtemberg; but the Duke of Bavaria
checked his progre&s;s, and he acted on the defen&s;ive du|ring
the remaining part of the campaign. The Emperor
was le&s;s fortunate in his effors again&s;t the Turks, who
rejected the conditions of peace he had offered, and took
the field, under a new Vi&s;ir. In the month of Augu&s;t
Count Tekeli defeated a body of Imperiali&s;ts near Cron&s;tadt,
in Tran&s;ylvania; then convoking the &s;tates of that province
at Albajulia, he compelled them to elect him their &s;ove|reign;
but his reign was of &s;hort duration. Prince Louis,
of Baden, having taken the command of the Au&s;trian
army, detached four regiments into Belgrade, and ad|vanced
again&s;t Tekeli, who retired into Valachia at his
approach. Meanwhile, the Grand Vi&s;ir inve&s;ted Belgrade,
<PB N="99" REF="103">
and carried on his attacks with &s;urpri&s;ing re&s;olution. At
length, a bomb falling upon a great tower, in which the
powder magazine of the be&s;ieged was contained, the place
blew up with a dreadful explo&s;ion. Seventeen hundred
&s;oldiers of the garri&s;on were de&s;troyed; the walls and
ramparts were overthrown; the ditch was filled up, and
&s;o large a breach was opened, that the Turks entered by
&s;quadrons and battalions, cutting in pieces all that fell in
their way. The fire &s;pread from magazine to magazine
until eleven were de&s;troyed; and, in the confu&s;ion, the
remaining part of the garri&s;on e&s;caped to Peterwaradin.
By this time the Imperiali&s;ts were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Tran|&s;ylvania,
and cantoned at Cron&s;tadt and Clau&s;inburgh.
Tekeli undertook to attack the province on one &s;ide,
while a body of Turks &s;hould invade it on the other:
the&s;e la&s;t were totally di&s;per&s;ed by Prince Louis, of Ba|den;
but Prince Augu&s;tus, of Hanover, whom he had de|tached
again&s;t the Count, was &s;lain in a narrow defile, and
his troops were obliged to retreat with precipitation. Te|keli,
however, did not improve this advantage. Being
appri&s;ed of the fate of his allies, and afraid of &s;eeing his
retreat cut off by the &s;now, that frequently choaks up
the pa&s;&s;es of the mountains, he retreated again to Vala|chia,
and Prince Louis returned to Vienna.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. King William having publi&s;hed a proclamation,
requiring the attendance of the members on the &s;econd
day of October, both Hou&s;es met accordingly, and he
opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech to the u&s;ual purport.
He mentioned what he had done towards the reduction
of Ireland; commended the behaviour of the troops;
told them the &s;upplies were not equal to the nece&s;&s;ary
expen&s;e; repre&s;ented the danger to which the nation
would be expo&s;ed, unle&s;s the war &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted
with vigour; conjured them to clear his revenue, which
was mortgaged for the payment of &s;ome debts, and ena|ble
him to pay off the arrears of the army; a&s;&s;ured them
that the &s;ucce&s;s of the confederacy abroad would depend
upon the vigour and di&s;patch of their proceedings; ex|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="100" REF="104">
his re&s;entment again&s;t tho&s;e who had been guilty
of mi&s;conduct in the management of the fleet; recom|mended
unanimity and expedition; and declared, that
whoever &s;hould attempt to divert their attention from
tho&s;e &s;ubjects of importance which he had propo&s;ed, could
neither be a friend to him, nor a well-wi&s;her to his coun|try.
The late attempt upon the French upon the coa&s;t
of England, the rumours of a con&s;piracy by the Jacobites,
the per&s;onal valour which William had di&s;played in Ire|land,
and the pu&s;illanimous behaviour of James, con|curred
in warming the re&s;entment of the nation again&s;t
the adherents of the late King, and in rai&s;ing a tide of
loyalty in favour of the new government. Both Hou|&s;es
pre&s;ented &s;eparate addre&s;&s;es of congratulation to the
King and Queen, upon his courage and conduct in the
field, and her fortitude and &s;agacity at the helm, in times
of danger and di&s;quiet. The Commons, pur&s;uant to
an e&s;timate laid before them of the next year's ex|pen&s;es,
voted a &s;upply of four millions for the mainte|nance
of the army and navy, and &s;ettled the funds for that
purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. They propo&s;ed to rai&s;e one million by the &s;ale
of forfeited e&s;tates in Ireland: they re&s;olved, that a bill
&s;hould be brought in for confi&s;cating tho&s;e e&s;tates, with
a clau&s;e, empowering the King to be&s;tow a third part of
them on tho&s;e who had &s;erved in the war, as well as to
grant &s;uch articles and capitulations to tho&s;e who were in
arms, as he &s;hould think proper. This clau&s;e was reject|ed;
and a great number of petitions were offered again&s;t
the bill, by creditors and heirs, who had continued
faithful to the government. The&s;e were &s;uppo&s;ed to have
been &s;ugge&s;ted by the court, in order to retard the pro|gre&s;s
of the bill; for the e&s;tates had been already promi&s;ed
to the King's favourites: neverthele&s;s the bill pa&s;&s;ed the
Lower Hou&s;e, and was &s;ent up to the Lords, among
whom it was purpo&s;ely delayed by the influence of the
mini&s;try. It was at this juncture that Lord Torrington
was tried and acquitted, very much to the di&s;&s;atisfaction
<PB N="101" REF="105">
of the King, who not only di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him from the &s;ervice,
but even forbade him to appear in his pre&s;ence. When
William came to the Hou&s;e of Lords, to give the royal
a&s;&s;ent to a bill for doubling the Exci&s;e, he told the parlia|ment,
that the po&s;ture of affairs required his pre&s;ence at
the Hague; that, therefore, they ought to lo&s;e no time
in perfecting &s;uch other &s;upplies as were &s;till nece&s;&s;ary for
the maintenance of the army and navy; and he reminded
them of making &s;ome provi&s;ion for the expen&s;e of the
civil government. Two bills were accordingly pa&s;&s;ed for
granting to their Maje&s;ties the duties on goods imported,
for five years; and the&s;e, together with the mutiny-bill,
received the royal a&s;&s;ent: upon which occa&s;ion the King
ob&s;erved, that if &s;ome annual provi&s;ion could be made for
augmenting the navy, it would greatly conduce to the
honour and &s;afety of the nation. In con&s;equence of this
hint, they voted a con&s;iderable &s;upply for building addi|tional
&s;hips of war<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This &s;upply was rai&s;ed by the additional duties on beer, ale, and other liquors. They al&s;o provided in the bill, that the impo&s;itions on wines, vine|gar, and tobacco, &s;hould be made a fund of credit: That the &s;urplus of the grants they had made, after the current &s;ervice was provided for, &s;hould be applicable to the payment of the debts contracted by the war; and, That it &s;hould be lawful for their Maje&s;ties to make u&s;e of five hundred thou&s;and pounds, out of the &s;aid grants, on condition of that &s;um's being repaid from the revenue.&mdash;Ralph.</NOTE>, and proceeded with &s;uch alacrity
and expedition, as even &s;eemed to anticipate the King's
de&s;ires. This liberality and di&s;patch were in a great mea|&s;ure
owing to the management of the Lord Godolphin,
who was now placed at the head of the Trea&s;ury, and Sir
John Somers, the Solicitor-General. The place of &s;ecre|tary
of &s;tate, which had remained vacant &s;ince the re&s;ig|nation
of the Earl of Shrew&s;bury, was now filled with
Lord Sidney; and Sir Charles Porter was appointed one
of the ju&s;tices of Ireland, in the room of this nobleman.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. Notwith&s;tanding the act for rever&s;ing the
proceedings again&s;t the city-charter, the Whigs had made
&s;hift to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the magi&s;tracy: Pilkington con|tinued
Mayor, and Robin&s;on retained the office of Cham|berlain.
<PB N="102" REF="106">
The Tories of the city, pre&s;uming upon their
late &s;ervices, pre&s;ented a petition to the Hou&s;e of Com|mons,
complaining, That the intent of the late act of
parliament, for rever&s;ing the judgment on the <HI>Quo War|ranto,</HI>
was fru&s;trated by &s;ome doubtful expre&s;&s;ion: &s;o that
the old Aldermen elected by commi&s;&s;ions under the late
King's great &s;eal &s;till acted by virtue of that authority:
That Sir Thomas Pilkington was not duly returned as
Mayor by the common-hall: and, That he and the
Aldermen had impo&s;ed Mr. Leonard Robin&s;on upon them
as Chamberlain, though another per&s;on was duly elected
into that office: That divers members of the common-council
were illegally excluded, and others, duly elected,
were refu&s;ed admittance. They &s;pecified other grievances,
and petitioned for relief. Piikington and his a&s;&s;ociates
undertook to prove that tho&s;e allegations were either fal&s;e
or frivolous; and repre&s;ented the petition as a contri|vance
of the Jacobites, to di&s;turb the peace of the city,
that the &s;upply might be retarded, and the government
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. In the late panick which over&s;pread the na|tion,
the Whigs had appeared to be the monied men,
and &s;ub&s;cribed largely for the &s;ecurity of the &s;ettlement
they had made, while the Tories kept aloof with a &s;u&s;|picious
caution. For this rea&s;on, the court now inter|po&s;ed
its influence in &s;uch a manner, that little or no re|gard
was paid to their remon&s;trance.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. The Marquis of Caermarthen, Lord-Pre&s;i|dent,
who was at the head of the Tory intere&s;t in the
mini&s;try, and had acquired great credit with the King
and Queen, now fell under the di&s;plea&s;ure of the oppo|&s;ite
faction; and they re&s;olved (if po&s;&s;ible) to revive his
old impeachment. The Earl of Shrew&s;bury, and thirteen
other leading men, had engaged in this de&s;ign. A com|mittee
of Lords was appointed to examine precedents,
and enquire whether impeachments continued <HI>in &s;latu quo</HI>
from parliament to parliament. Several &s;uch precedents
were reported; and violent debates en&s;ued: but, the
Marquis eluded the vengeance of his enemies, in con&s;e|quence
<PB N="103" REF="107">
of the following que&s;tion, &startq;Whether the Earls
of Sali&s;bury and Peterborough, who had been impeached
in the former parliament, for being reconciled to the
church of Rome, &s;hall be di&s;charged from their bail?&endq;
The Hou&s;e re&s;olved in the affirmative, and &s;everal lords
entered a prote&s;t. The Commons having fini&s;hed a bill
for appointing commi&s;&s;ioners to take and &s;tate the publick
accounts; and having cho&s;en the commi&s;&s;ioners from
among their own members, &s;ent it up to the Hou&s;e of
Lords. There the Earl of Roche&s;ter moved, that they
&s;hould add &s;ome of their number to tho&s;e of the Com|mons:
they accordingly cho&s;e an equal number by ballot;
but Roche&s;ter him&s;elf being elected, refu&s;ed to act: the
others followed his example, and the bill pa&s;&s;ed without
alteration. On the fifth day of January, the King put
an end to the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech, in which he thanked
them for the repeated in&s;tances they had exhibited of their
affection to his per&s;on and government. He told them it
was high time for him to embark for Holland; recom|mended
unanimity; and a&s;&s;ured them of his particular
favour and protection. Then Lord Chief Baron Atkins
&s;ignified his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure, that the two Hou&s;es
&s;hould adjourn them&s;elves to the thirty-fir&s;t day of
March<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In this year the Engli&s;h planters repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of part of the i&s;land of St. Chri&s;topher's, from which they had been driven by the French.</NOTE>.</P>

Admiral Rooke. Next day, being informed by a fi&s;her|man,
that he was within a league and a half of Goree,
he quitted the yatch, and went into an open boat, attended
by the Duke of Ormond, the Earls of Devon&s;hire, Dor&s;et,
Portland, and Monmouth, with Auverquerque, and Zuy|le&s;tein.

In&s;tead of landing immediately,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1691.</NOTE> they lo&s;t &s;ight
of the fleet, and night coming on, were expo&s;ed in very
&s;evere weather to the danger of the enemy and the &s;ea,
which ran very high for eighteen hours, during which,
the King and all his attendants were drenched with &s;ea-water.
When the &s;ailors expre&s;&s;ed their apprehen&s;ions of
peri&s;hing, the King a&s;ked if they were afraid to die in his
company? At day-break, he landed on the I&s;le of Goree,
where he took &s;ome refre&s;hment in a fi&s;herman's hut;
then he committed him&s;elf to the boat again, and was
conveyed to the &s;hore in the neighbourhood of Mae&s;land|&s;luys.
A deputation of the States received him at
Houn&s;lardyke: about &s;ix in the evening he arrived at the
Hague, where he was immediately complimented by the
States-General, the &s;tates of Holland, the council of &s;tate,
the other colleges, and the foreign mini&s;ters. He after|wards,
at the reque&s;t of the magi&s;trates, made his publick
entry with &s;urpri&s;ing magnificence; and the Dutch cele|brated
his arrival with bonfires, illuminations, and other
marks of tumultuous joy. He a&s;&s;i&s;ted at their different
a&s;&s;emblies; informed them of his &s;ucce&s;&s;es in England
and Ireland; and a&s;&s;ured them of his con&s;tant zeal and
affection for his native country.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVI. At a &s;olemn congre&s;s of the confederate
princes, he repre&s;ented, in a &s;et &s;peech, the dangers to
which they were expo&s;ed from the power and ambition of
France; and the nece&s;&s;ity of acting with vigour and
di&s;patch. He declared he would &s;pare neither his credit,
$orces, nor per&s;on, in concurring with their mea&s;ures;
and that in the &s;pring he would come at the head of his
troops to fulfil his engagements. They forthwith re&s;olved
to employ two hundred and twenty-two thou&s;and men
again&s;t France in the en&s;uing campaign. The proportions
of the different princes and &s;tates were regulated; and
the King of England agreed to furni&s;h twenty thou&s;and.
He &s;upplied the Duke of Savoy &s;o liberally, that his af|fairs
&s;oon a&s;&s;umed a more promi&s;ing a&s;pect. The plan of
operations was &s;ettled; and they tran&s;acted their affairs
<PB N="105" REF="109">
with &s;uch harmony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. II. 1691.</NOTE> that no di&s;pute interrupted their de|liberations.
In the beginning of March, immediately
after the congre&s;s broke up, the &s;iege of Mons was under|taken
by the French King in per&s;on, accompanied by the
Dauphin, the Dukes of Orleans and Chartres. The
garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of about &s;ix thou&s;and men, commanded
bythe Prince of Bergue: but the be&s;iegers carried on
their works with &s;uch rapidity as they could not with|&s;tand.
King William no &s;ooner under&s;tood that the
place was inve&s;ted, than he ordered Prince Waldeck to
a&s;&s;emble the army, determined to march again&s;t the enemy
in per&s;on. Fifty thou&s;and men were &s;oon collected at
Halle, near Bru&s;&s;els: but, when he went thither, he found
the Spaniards had neglected to provide carriages, and other
nece&s;&s;aries for the expedition. Mean while, the burghers
of Mons, &s;eeing their town in danger of being utterly de|&s;troyed
by the bombs and cannon of the enemy, pre&s;&s;ed
the governor to capitulate, and even threatened to intro|duce
the be&s;iegers: &s;o that he was forced to comply, and
obtained very honourable conditions. William, being
appri&s;ed of this event, returned to the Hague, embarked
for England, and arrived at Whitehall on the thirteenth
day of April<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">A few days before his arrival, great part of the palace of Whitehall was con&s;umed by fire, through the negligence of a female &s;ervant.</NOTE>.</P>

&sect; I. A Con&s;piracy again&s;t the government had been
lately di&s;covered. In the latter end of De|cember,
the ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el who lived at Barking, in
E&s;&s;ex, informed the Marquis of Caermarthen, that his wife
had let out one of his boats to carry over &s;ome per&s;ons to
France; and that they would embark on the thirtieth day
of the month. This intelligence being communicated to
the King and council, an order was &s;ent to Captain Bil|lop,
to watch the motion of the ve&s;&s;el, and &s;ecure the
pa&s;&s;engers. He accordingly boarded her at Grave&s;end,
and found in the hold Lord Pre&s;ton, Mr. A&s;hton, a &s;er|vant
of the late Queen, and one Elliot. He likewi&s;e &s;ei&s;ed
a bundle of papers, &s;ome of which were &s;carce intelligible;
among the re&s;t, two letters, &s;uppo&s;ed to be written by
Turner, Bi&s;hop of Ely, to King James and his Queen,
under fictitious names. The whole amounted to an invi|tation
to the French King, to a&s;&s;i&s;t King James in re|a&s;cending
the throne, upon certain conditions, while
William &s;hould be ab&s;ent from the kingdom: but, the
&s;cheme was ill laid, and countenanced but by a very
few per&s;ons of con&s;ideration, among whom the chiefs were
the Earl of Clarendon, the Bi&s;hop of Ely, Lord Pre&s;ton,
his brother, Mr. Graham, and Penn, the famous quaker.
Notwith&s;tanding the outcries which had been made again&s;t
the &s;everities of the late government, Pre&s;ton, and his
accomplice A&s;hton, were tried at the Old Bailey for com|pa&s;&s;ing
the death of their Maje&s;ties King William and
Queen Mary; and their tryals were hurried on, without
any regard to their petitions for delay. Lord Pre&s;ton
alledged, in his defence, that the trea&s;ons charged upon
him were not committed in the county of Middle&s;ex, as
$aid in the indictment; that none of the witne&s;&s;es declared
$e had any concern in hiring the ve&s;&s;el; that the papers
were not found upon him; that there ought to be two
<PB N="108" REF="112">
credible witne&s;&s;es to every fact, whereas, the whole proof
again&s;t him re&s;ted on &s;imilitude of hands, and mere &s;uppo|&s;ition.
He was, neverthele&s;s, found guilty. A&s;hton
behaved with great intrepidity and compo&s;ure. He owned
his purpo&s;e of going to France, in pur&s;uance of a promi&s;e
he had made to General Worden, who, on his death-bed,
conjured him to go thither, and fini&s;h &s;ome affairs of con|&s;equence
which he had left there depending; as well as with
a view to recover a con&s;iderable &s;um of money due to him|&s;elf.
He denied that he was privy to the contents of the
papers found upon him: he complained of his having been
denied time to prepare for his trial; and called &s;everal
per&s;ons to prove him a prote&s;tant of exemplary piety and
irreproachable morals. The&s;e circum&s;tances had no
weight with the court. He was brow-beaten by the
bench, and found guilty by the jury, as he had the papers
in his cu&s;tody: yet, there was no privity proved; and
the Whig party them&s;elves had often expre&s;sly declared&punc;
that of all &s;orts of evidence, that of finding papers in a
per&s;on's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is the weake&s;t, becau&s;e no man can
&s;ecure him&s;elf from &s;uch danger. A&s;hton &s;uffered with
equal courage and decorum. In a paper which he de|livered
to the Sheriff, he owned his attachment to King
James: he witne&s;&s;ed to the birth of the Prince of Wales;
denied his knowledge of the contents of the papers that
were committed to his charge; complained of the hard
mea&s;ure he had met with from the judges and the jury
but forgave them in the &s;ight of heaven. This man was
celebrated by the Nonjurors as a martyr to loyalty; and
they boldly affirmed, that his chief crime in the eyes of
the government, was his having among his baggage, an
account of &s;uch evidence as would have been convincing
to all the world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. State tracts. Burchet. Tindal. Ralph.</NOTE> concerning the birth of the Prince of
Wales, which by a great number of people was believed
&s;uppo&s;itious<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">To one of the pamphlets publi&s;hed on this occa&s;ion, is annexed a $$+$ition to the pre&s;ent government, in the name of King James's adherent importing, that &s;ome grave and learned per&s;on &s;hould be authori&s;ed to com|pile a treati&s;e, &s;howing the grounds of William's title; and declaring, that in ca&s;e the performance &s;hould carry conviction along with it, they would &s;ubmit to that title, as they had hither to oppo&s;ed it from a principle of con|&s;cience. The be&s;t an&s;wer that could be made to this &s;ummons, was Locke's book upon government, which appeared at this period. Ralph.</NOTE>. Lord Pre&s;ton obtained a pardon: $word$
<PB N="109" REF="113">
was not tried, becau&s;e no evidence appeared again&s;t him:
the Earl of Clarendon was &s;ent to the Tower, where he
remained &s;ome months, and he was afterwards confined
to his own hou&s;e in the country: an indulgence, which
he owed to his con&s;anguinity with the Queen, who was
his fir&s;t cou&s;in. The Bi&s;hop of Ely, Graham, and Penn
ab&s;conded; and a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued for appre|hending
them as traitors.</P>
<P>&sect; II. This prelate's being concerned in a con&s;piracy
furni&s;hed the King with a plau&s;ible pretence for filling up
the vacant bi&s;hopricks. The deprived bi&s;hops had been
given to under&s;tand, that an act of parliament might be
obtained to excu&s;e them from taking the oaths, provided
they would perform their epi&s;copal functions: but, as
they declined this expedient, the King re&s;olved to fill up
their places at his return from Holland. Accordingly,
the Archbi&s;hoprick of Canterbury was conferred upon Dr.
Tillot&s;on<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Beveridge was promoted to the &s;ee of Bath and Wells, Fowler to that of Glouce&s;ter, Cumberland to Peterborough, Moore to Norwich, Grove to Chiche&s;ter, and Patrick to Ely.</NOTE>, one of the mo&s;t learned, moderate, and vir|tuous
eccle&s;ia&s;ticks of the age, who did not accept of this
promotion without great reluctance, becau&s;e he fore&s;aw
that he &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the &s;lander and malevolence
of that party which e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of his predece&s;&s;or.
The other vacant &s;ees were given to divines of un|blemi&s;hed
character; and the publick in general &s;eemed
very well &s;atisfied with this exertion of the King's &s;u|premacy.
The deprived bi&s;hops at fir&s;t affected all the
meekne&s;s of re&s;ignation. They remembered tho&s;e &s;houts
of popular approbation, by which they had been ani|mated
in the per&s;ecution they &s;uffered under the late
government; and they hoped the &s;ame cordial would &s;up|port
<PB N="110" REF="114">
them in their pre&s;ent affliction: but, finding the
nation cold in their concern, they determined to warm it
by argument and declamation. The pre&s;s groaned with
the efforts of their learning and re&s;entment; and every
e&s;&s;ay was an&s;wered by their opponents. The Nonjurors
affirmed, that Chri&s;tianity was a doctrine of the cro&s;s;
that no pretence whatever could ju&s;tify an in&s;urrection
again&s;t the Sovereign; that the primitive chri&s;tians
thought it their indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to be pa&s;&s;ive under
every inva&s;ion of their rights; and, that non-re&s;i&s;tance
was the doctrine of the Engli&s;h church, confirmed by all
the &s;anctions that could be derived from the laws of God
and man. The other party, not only &s;upported the
natural rights of mankind, and explained the u&s;e that
might be made of the doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;tance, in
exciting fre&s;h commotions; but they al&s;o argued, that if
pa&s;&s;ive obedience was right in any in&s;tance, it was con|clu&s;ively
&s;o with regard to the pre&s;ent government; for
the obedience required by &s;cripture was indi&s;criminate,
&startq;the powers that be, are ordained of God&mdash;let every
&s;oul be &s;ubject to the higher powers.&endq; From the&s;e
texts they inferred, that the new oaths ought to be taken
without &s;cruple; and that tho&s;e who refu&s;ed them, con|cealed
party under the cloak of con&s;cience. On the other
hand, the fallacy and treachery of this argument were de|mon&s;trated.
They &s;aid, it levelled all di&s;tinctions of ju|&s;tice
and duty; that tho&s;e who taught &s;uch doctrines,
attached them&s;elves &s;olely to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, however unju&s;tly
acquired; that if twenty different u&s;urpers &s;hould &s;ucceed
one another, they would recogni&s;e the la&s;t, notwith&s;tand|ing
the allegiance they had &s;o &s;olemnly &s;worn to his pre|dece&s;&s;or,
like the fawning &s;paniel that followed the thief
who mounted his ma&s;ter's hor&s;e, after having murthered
the right owner. They al&s;o denied the ju&s;tice of a lay-deprivation,
and with re&s;pect to church-government
&s;tarted the &s;ame di&s;tinctions &startq;<HI>De jure</HI> and <HI>De facto,</HI>&endq;
which they had formerly made in the civil admini&s;tration.
They had even recour&s;e to all the bitterne&s;s of invective
<PB N="111" REF="115">
again&s;t Tillot&s;on and the new bi&s;hops, whom they reviled
as intruders and u&s;urpers: their acrimony was chiefly
directed again&s;t Dr. Sherlock, who had been one of the
mo&s;t violent &s;ticklers again&s;t the revolution, but thought
proper to take the oaths upon the retreat of King James
from Ireland. They branded him as an apo&s;tate, who had
betrayed his cau&s;e, and publi&s;hed a review of his whole
conduct, which proved a &s;evere &s;atire upon his character.
Their attacks upon individuals were mingled with their
vengeance again&s;t the government: and indeed the great
aim of their divines, as well as of their politicians, was to
&s;ap the foundation of the new &s;ettlement. In order to
alienate the minds of the people from the intere&s;ts of the
reigning prince, they ridiculed his character: inveighed
again&s;t his mea&s;ures: they accu&s;ed him of &s;acrificing the
concerns of England to the advantage of his native
country; and drew invidious compari&s;ons between the
wealth, the trade, the taxes of the la&s;t, and of the pre&s;ent
reign. To fru&s;trate the&s;e efforts of the malcontents, the
court employed their engines to an&s;wer and recriminate:
all &s;orts of informers were encouraged and care&s;&s;ed: in a
proclamation i&s;&s;ued again&s;t papi&s;ts and other di&s;affected
per&s;ons, all magi&s;trates were enjoined to make &s;earch, and
apprehend tho&s;e who &s;hould, by &s;editious di&s;cour&s;es and
libels, pre&s;ume to defame the government. Thus the
Revolutioners commenced the profe&s;&s;ed enemies of tho&s;e
very arts and practices which had enabled them to bring
their &s;cheme to perfection.</P>
<P>&sect; III. The pre&s;byterians in Scotland acted with &s;uch
folly, violence, and tyranny, as rendered them equally
odious and contemptible. The tran&s;actions in their
general a&s;&s;embly were carried on with &s;uch peevi&s;hne&s;s,
partiality, and inju&s;tice, that the King di&s;&s;olved it by an
act of &s;tate, and convoked another for the month of No|vember
in the following year. The epi&s;copal party pro|mi&s;ed
to enter heartily into the intere&s;ts of the new govern|ment,
to keep the Highlanders quiet, and induce the
clergy to acknowledge and &s;erve King William, provided
<PB N="112" REF="116">
he would balance the power of Melvill and his parti&s;ans
in &s;uch a manner, as would &s;ecure them from violence and
oppre&s;&s;ion; provided the epi&s;copal mini&s;ters &s;hould be per|mitted
to perform their functions among tho&s;e people by
whom they were beloved; and that &s;uch of them as were
willing to mix with the pre&s;byterians in their judicatories,
&s;hould be admitted without any &s;evere impo&s;ition in point
of opinion. The King, who was extremely di&s;gu&s;ted at
the pre&s;byterians, reli&s;hed the propo&s;al; and young Dal|rymple,
&s;on of Lord Stair, was appointed joint &s;ecretary
of &s;tate with Melvill. He undertook to bring over the
majority of the Jacobites, and a great number of them
took the oaths: but at the &s;ame time they maintained a
corre&s;pondence with the court of St. Germains, by the
connivance of which they &s;ubmitted to William, that
they might be in a condition to &s;erve James the more
effectually. The Scotti&s;h parliament was adjourned by
proclamation to the &s;ixteenth day of September. Pre|cautions
were taken to prevent any dangerous communi|cation
with the continent: a committee was appointed to
put the kingdom in a po&s;ture of defence; to exerci&s;e the
powers of the regency, in &s;ecuring the enemies of the
government; and the Earl of Home, with Sir Peter
Fra&s;er and Sir Aeneas Macpher&s;on were apprehended
and impri&s;oned.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. The King having &s;ettled the operations of the
en&s;uing campaign in Ireland, where General Gincke$
exerci&s;ed the &s;upreme command, manned his fleet by din$
of pre&s;&s;ing &s;ailors, to the incredible annoyance of com|merce:
then, leaving the Queen as before at the helm o$
government in England, he returned to Holland, accom|panied
by Lord Sidney, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, the Earls o$
Marlborough and Portland, and began to make prepa|rations
for taking the field in per&s;on. On the thirtieth
day of May, the Duke of Luxembourg having pa&s;&s;ed th$
Scheld at the head of a large army, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion o$
Halle, and gave it up to plunder, in &s;ight of the $word$,
who were obliged to throw up entrenchments &s;o
<PB N="113" REF="117">
their pre&s;ervation. At the &s;ame time the Marquis de
Boufflers, with a con&s;iderable body of forces, entrenched
him&s;elf before Liege, with a view to bombard that city.
In the beginning of June, King William took upon him|&s;elf
the command of the allied army, by this time re|enforced
in &s;uch a manner as to be &s;uperior to the enemy.
He forthwith detached the County de Tilly, with ten thou|&s;and
men, to the relief of Liege, which was already re|duced
to ruins and de&s;olation by the bombs, bullets, and
repeated attacks of Boufflers, who now thought proper to
retreat to Dinant. Tilly, having thus rai&s;ed the &s;iege,
and thrown a body of troops into Huy, rejoined the con|federate
army, which had been augmented even &s;ince his
departure with &s;ix thou&s;and men from Brandenburgh, and
ten thou&s;and He&s;&s;ians, commanded by the Landgrave in
per&s;on. Such was the vigilance of Luxembourg, that
William could not avail him&s;elf of his &s;uperiority. In
vain he exhau&s;ted his invention in marches, counter-marches,
and &s;tratagems, to bring on a general engage|ment:
the French mar&s;hal avoided it with &s;uch dexterity,
as baffled all his endeavours. In the cour&s;e of this cam|paign,
the two armies twice confronted each other: but
they were &s;ituated in &s;uch a manner that neither could
begin the attack without a manife&s;t di&s;advantage. While
the King lay encamped at Court-&s;ur-heure, a &s;oldier,
corrupted by the enemy, &s;et $ire to the fu&s;ees of &s;everal
bombs, the explo&s;ion of which might have blown up the
whole magazine, and produced infinite confu&s;ion in the
army, had not the mi&s;chief been prevented by the courage
of the men who guarded the artillery: even while the
fu&s;ees were burning they di&s;engaged the waggons from
the line, and overturned them down the &s;ide of a hill;
&s;o that the communication of the fire was intercepted.
The per&s;on who made this treacherous attempt being di&s;|covered,
owned he had been employed for this purpo&s;e by
the Duke of Luxembourg. He was tried by a court|martial,
and &s;uffered the death of a traitor. Such per|fidious
practices not only &s;ix an indelible &s;hare of infamy
<PB N="114" REF="118">
on the French General, but prove how much the capacity
of William was dreaded by his enemies. King William,
quiting Court-&s;ur-heure, encamped upon the plain of
St. Girard, where he remained till the fourth day of Sep|tember,
con&s;uming the forage, and exhau&s;ting the country.
Then he pa&s;&s;ed the Sambre near Jemeppe, while the
French cro&s;&s;ed it at La Bu&s;iere, and both armies marched
towards Enghien. The enemy, perceiving the confede|rates
were at their heels, proceeded to Gramont, pa&s;&s;ed the
Dender, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;trong camp between
Aeth and Oudenarde: William followed the &s;ame route,
and encamped between Aeth and Leu&s;e. While he con|tinued
in this po&s;t, the He&s;&s;ian forces and tho&s;e of Liege,
amounting to about eighteen thou&s;and men, &s;eparated
from the army, and pa&s;&s;ed the Meu&s;e at Namur: then the
King returned to the Hague, leaving the command to
Prince Waldeck, who forthwith removed to Leu&s;e, and
on the twentieth day of the month began his march to
Cambron. Luxembourg, who watched his motions with
a curious eye, found means to attack him in his retreat &s;o
&s;uddenly, that his rear was &s;urpri&s;ed and defeated, though
the French were at la&s;t obliged to retire: the Prince con|tinued
his route to Cambron, and in a little time both
armies retired into winter-quarters. In the mean time,
the Duke de Noailles be&s;ieged and took Urgel in Cata|lonia,
while a French &s;quadron, commanded by the Count
D'Etrees, bombarded Barcelona and Alicant.</P>
<P>&sect; V. The confederates had propo&s;ed to act vigorou&s;ly
in Italy again&s;t the French; but the &s;ea&s;on was far ad|vanced
before they were in a condition to take the field.
The Emperor and Spain had undertaken to furni&s;h troops
to join the Duke of Savoy; and the maritime powers
contributed their proportion in money. The Elector of
Bavaria was nominated to the &s;upreme command of the
Imperial forces in that country: the Marquis de Leganez,
governor of the Milane&s;e, acted as tru&s;tee for the Spani&s;h
monarch: Duke Schomberg, &s;on of that great general
who lo&s;t his life at the Boyne, lately created Duke of
<PB N="115" REF="119">
Lein&s;ter, managed the intere&s;t of William, as King of
England and Stadtholder, and commanded a body of the
Vaudois paid by Great-Britain. Before the German auxi|liaries
arrived, the French had made great progre&s;s in
their conque&s;ts. Catinat be&s;ieged and took Villa-Franca,
Nice, and &s;ome other fortifications; then he reduced
Villana and Carmagnola, and detached the Marquis de
Feuquieres to inve&s;t Coni, a &s;trong fortre&s;s garri&s;oned by
the Vaudois and French refugees. The Duke of Savoy
was now reduced to the brink of ruin. He &s;aw almo&s;t all
his places of &s;trength in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy: Coni
was be&s;ieged: and La Hoguette, another French general,
had forced the pa&s;&s;es of the valley of Ao&s;te, &s;o that he had
free admi&s;&s;ion into the Verceillois, and the frontiers of the
Milane&s;e. Turin was threatened with a bombardment;
the people were di&s;pirited and clamorous, and their &s;ove|reign
lay with his little army encamped on the hill of
Montcallier, from whence he beheld his towns taken, and
his place of Rivoli de&s;troyed. Duke Schomberg exhorted
him to act on the offen&s;ive, and give battle to Catinat,
while that officer's army was weakened by detachments,
and Prince Eugene<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prince Eugene, of Savoy, who in the &s;equel rivalled the &s;ame of the greate&s;t warriors of antiquity, was de&s;cended on the father's &s;ide from the Hou&s;e of Savoy, and on the mother's from the family of Soi&s;&s;ons, a branch of the Hou&s;e of Bourbon. His father was Eugene Maurice, of Savoy, Count of Soi&s;&s;ons, Colonel of the Switzers, and Governor of Champagne and Brie: his mother was the celebrated Olympia de Mancini, niece of Cardinal Mazarine. Prince Eugene, finding him&s;elf neglected at the court of France, engaged as a &s;oldier of fortune in the &s;ervice of the Emperor, and &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his great military talents: he was, moreover, an ac|compli&s;hed gentleman, learned, liberal, mild, and courteous; an un&s;haken friend; a generous enemy; an invincible captain; a con$$mmate politician.</NOTE> &s;upported his remon&s;trance: but this
propo&s;al was vehemently oppo&s;ed by the Marquis de Lega|nez,
who fore&s;aw that, if the Duke &s;hould be defeated, the
French would penetrate into the territories of Milan. The
relief of Coni, however, was undertaken by Prince
Eugene, who began his march for that place with a convoy
guarded by two-and-twenty hundred hor&s;e: at Magliano
<PB N="116" REF="120">
he was re-enforced by five thou&s;and militia: Bulonde,
who commanded at the &s;iege, no &s;ooner heard of his ap|proach
than he retired with the utmo&s;t precipitation,
leaving behind &s;ome pieces of cannon, mortars, bombs,
arms, ammunition, tents, provi&s;ions, uten&s;ils, with all
his &s;ick and wounded. When he joined Catinat, he was
immediately put under arre&s;t, and afterwards ca&s;hiered
with di&s;grace. Hoguette abandoned the valley of Ao&s;te:
Feuquieres was &s;ent with a detachment to change the
garri&s;on of Ca&s;al; and Catinat retired with his army to|wards
Villa Nova d'A&s;te.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. The mi&s;carriage of the French before Coni
affected Louvois, the mini&s;ter of Louis, &s;o deeply, that
he could not help &s;hedding tears when he communicated
the event to his ma&s;ter, who told him, with great compo|&s;ure,
that he was &s;poiled by good fortune. But the re|treat
of the French from Piedmont had a &s;till greater in|fluence
over the re&s;olutions of the conclave at Rome, then
&s;itting for the election of a new pope, in the room of Alex|ander
VIII. who died in the beginning of February. Not|with&s;tanding
the power and intrigues of the French
faction, headed by Cardinal D'Etrees, the affairs of
Piedmont had no &s;ooner taken this turn, than the Italians
joined the Spani&s;h and Imperial intere&s;t, and Cardinal
Pignatelli, a Neapolitan, was elected pontiff. He a&s;|&s;umed
the name of Innocent, in honour of the la&s;t pope
known by that appellation, and adopted all his maxims
again&s;t the French Monarch. When the German auxi|liaries
arrived, under the command of the Elector of
Bavaria, the confederates re&s;olved to give battle to Catinat;
but he repa&s;&s;ed the Po, and &s;ent couriers to Ver&s;ailles, to
&s;olicit a re-enforcement. Then Prince Eugene inve&s;ted
Carmagnola, and carried on the &s;iege with &s;uch vigour,
that in eleven days the garri&s;on capitulated. Mean while
the Marquis de Hocquincourt undertook the conque&s;t of
Montmelian, and reduced the town without much re&s;i&s;t|ance.
The ca&s;tle, however, made &s;uch a vigorous de|fence,
<PB N="117" REF="121">
that Catinat marched thither in per&s;on; and not|with&s;tanding
all his efforts, the place held out till the
&s;econd day of December, when it &s;urrendered on honour|able
conditions.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. This &s;ummer produced nothing of importance on
the Rhine. The French endeavoured to &s;urpri&s;e Mentz,
by maintaining a corre&s;pondence with one of the Emperor's
commi&s;&s;ioners: but this being di&s;covered, their de&s;ign
was fru&s;trated. The Imperial army, under the Elector
of Saxony, pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine in the neighbourhood of Man|heim;
and the French cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ame river at Philip&s;|burgh,
reduced the town of Portzheim in the marqui&s;ate of
Baden-Dourlach. The execution of the &s;cheme, pro|jected
by the Emperor for this campaign, was prevented
by the death of his general, the Elector of Saxony, which
happened on the &s;econd day of September. His affairs
wore a more favourable a&s;pect in Hungary, where the
Turks were totally defeated by Prince Louis of Baden on
the banks of the Danube. The Imperiali&s;ts afterwards
undertook the &s;iege of Great Waradin in Tran&s;ylvania;
but this was turned into a blockade, and the place was
not &s;urrendered till the following &s;pring. The Turks
were &s;o di&s;pirited by the defeat by which they had lo&s;t
the Grand Vi&s;ir, that the Emperor might have made
peace upon very advantageous terms; but his pride and
ambition over&s;hot his &s;ucce&s;s. He was weak, vain, and
&s;uper&s;titious; he imagined that now the war of Ireland
was almo&s;t extingui&s;hed, King William, with the re&s;t of
the allies, would be able to humble the French power,
though he him&s;elf &s;hould not co-operate with hereticks,
whom he abhorred; and that, in the mean time, he
&s;hould not only make an entire conque&s;t of Tran&s;ylvania,
but al&s;o carry his victorious arms to the Gates of Con&s;tan|tinople,
according to &s;ome ridiculous prophecy by which
his vanity had been &s;lattered. The Spani&s;h government
was become &s;o feeble, that the mini&s;try, rather than be at
the expence of defending the Netherlands, offered to deli|ver
the whole country to King William, either as Mo|narch
<PB N="118" REF="122">
of England, or Stadtholder of the United Provinces.
He declined this offer, becau&s;e he knew the people would
never be reconciled to a prote&s;tant government; but he
propo&s;ed that the Spaniards &s;hould confer the admini&s;tra|tion
of Flanders upon the Elector of Bavaria, who was
ambitious of &s;ignali&s;ing his courage, and able to defend
the country with his own troops and trea&s;ure. This pro|po&s;al
was reli&s;hed by the court of Spain: the Emperor
imparted it to the Elector, who accepted the office with|out
he&s;itation; and he was immediately declared Governor
of the Low-Countries by the council of &s;tate at Madrid.
King William, after his return from the army, continued
&s;ome time at the Hague, &s;ettling the operations of the
en&s;uing campaign. That affair being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, he em|barked
in the Mae&s;e, and landed in England on the
nineteenth day of October.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. Before we explain the proceedings in parlia|ment,
it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give a detail of the late
tran&s;actions in Ireland. In the beginning of the &s;ea&s;on
the French King had &s;ent a large &s;upply of provi&s;ion,
clothes, and ammunition, for the u&s;e of the Iri&s;h at
Limerick, under the conduct of Mon&s;ieur St. Ruth,
accompanied by a great number of French officers, fur|ni&s;hed
with commi&s;&s;ions from King James, though St.
Ruth i&s;&s;ued all his orders in the name of Louis. Tyrconnel
had arrived in January, with three frigates and nine
ve&s;&s;els, laden with &s;uccours of the &s;ame nature: other|wi&s;e
the Iri&s;h could not have been &s;o long kept together.
Nor, indeed, could the&s;e &s;upplies prevent them from
forming &s;eparate and independent bands of Rapparees, who
plundered the country, and committed the mo&s;t &s;hocking
barbarities. The Lords Ju&s;tices, in conjunction with
General Ginckel, had taken every &s;tep their prudence
could &s;ugge&s;t, to quiet the di&s;turbances of the country,
and prevent &s;uch violence and rapine, of which the
&s;oldiers in King William's army were not entirely inno|cent.
The ju&s;tices had i&s;&s;ued proclamations, denouncing
&s;evere penalties again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould countenance or
<PB N="119" REF="123">
conceal &s;uch acts of cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion: they promi&s;ed
to protect all papi&s;ts who &s;hould live quietly within a cer|tain
frontier line; and Ginckel gave the catholick rebels to
under&s;tand, that he was authori&s;ed to treat with them, if
they were inclined to return to their duty. Before the
armies took the field &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes had been fought
between parties; and the&s;e had always turned out &s;o un|fortunate
to the enemy, that their &s;pirits were quite
depre&s;&s;ed, while the confidence of the Engli&s;h ro&s;e in the
&s;ame proportion.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. St. Ruth and Tyrconnel were joined by the Rap|parces,
and General Ginckel was re-enforced by Mackay,
with tho&s;e troops which had reduced the Highlanders in
Scotland. Thus &s;trengthened, he, in the beginning of
June, marched from Mullingar to Ballymore, which was
garri&s;oned by a thou&s;and men under Colonel Bourke,
who, when &s;ummoned to &s;urrender, returned an eva&s;ive
an&s;wer. But, when a breach was made in the place, and
the be&s;iegers began to make preparations for a general
a&s;&s;ault, his men laid down their arms and &s;ubmitted at
di&s;cretion. The fortifications of this place being repaired
and augmented, the general left a garri&s;on for its defence,
and advanced to Athlone, &s;ituated on the other &s;ide of the
Shannon, and &s;upported by the Iri&s;h army encamped almo&s;t
under its walls. The Engli&s;h town, on the hither &s;ide of
the river, was taken &s;word in hand, and the enemy broke
down an arch of the bridge in their retreat. Batteries
were rai&s;ed again&s;t the Iri&s;h town, and &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful
attempts were made to force the pa&s;&s;age of the bridge,
which was defended with great vigour. At length, it was
re&s;olved, in a council of war, that a detachment &s;hould
pa&s;s at a ford a little to the left of the bridge, though the
river was deep and rapid, the bottom foul and &s;tony, and
the pa&s;s guarded by ravelin, erected for that purpo&s;e.
The forlorn hope con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ixty grenadiers in armour,
headed by Captain Sandys, and two lientenants. They
were &s;econded by another detachment, and this was &s;up|ported
by &s;ix battalions of infantry. Never was a more
<PB N="120" REF="124">
de&s;perate &s;ervice, nor was ever exploit performed with
more valour and intrepidity. They pa&s;&s;ed twenty a-brea&s;t,
in the face of the enemy, through an ince&s;&s;ant &s;hower of
balls, bullets, and grenades. Tho&s;e who followed them
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bridge, and laid planks over the
broken arch. Pontoons were fixed at the &s;ame time, that
the troops might pa&s;s in different places. The Iri&s;h were
amazed, confounded, and abandoned the town in the
utmo&s;t con&s;ternation; &s;o that, in half an hour, it was
wholly &s;ecured by the Engli&s;h, who did not lo&s;e above
fifty men in this attack. Mackay, Tetteau, and Ptole|mache,
exhibited proofs of the mo&s;t undaunted courage in
pa&s;&s;ing the river, and General Ginckel, for his conduct,
intrepidity, and &s;ucce&s;s, on this occa&s;ion, was created Earl
of Athlone. When St. Ruth was informed by expre&s;s,
that the Engli&s;h had entered the river, he &s;aid it was
impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould pretend to take a town which he
covered with his army, and that he would give a thou|&s;and
pi&s;toles they would attempt to force a pa&s;&s;age.
Sarsfield in&s;i&s;ted upon the truth of the intelligence, and
pre&s;&s;ed him to &s;end &s;uccours to the town: he ridiculed this
officer's fears, and &s;ome warm expo&s;tulation pa&s;&s;ed be|tween
them. Being at length convinced that the Engli&s;h
were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, he ordered &s;ome detach|ments
to drive them out again; but, the cannon of their
own works being turned again&s;t them, they found the ta&s;k
impracticable; and that very night their army decamped.
St. Ruth, after a march of ten miles, took po&s;t at
Aghrim, and having, by drafts from garri&s;ons, aug|mented
his army to five-and-twenty thou&s;and men, re&s;olv|ed
to hazard a deci&s;ive engagement.</P>
<P>&sect; X. Ginckel having put Athlone in a po&s;ture of de|fence,
pa&s;&s;ed the Shannon, and marched up to the enemy,
determined to give them battle, though his forces did not
exceed eighteen thou&s;and, and the Iri&s;h were po&s;ted in a
very advantageous &s;ituation. St. Ruth had made an ad|mirable
di&s;po&s;ition, and taken every precaution that mili|tary
&s;kill could &s;ugge&s;t. His centre extended along a
<PB N="121" REF="125">
ri&s;ing ground, uneven in many places, inter&s;ected with
banks and ditches, joined by lines of communication, and
fronted by a large bog almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able. His right was
fortified with entrenchments, and his left &s;ecured by the
ca&s;tle of Aghrim. He harangued his army in the mo&s;t
pathetick &s;train, conjuring them to exert their courage in
defence of their holy religion, in the extirpation of here&s;y,
in recovering their ancient honours and e&s;tates, and in
re&s;toring a pious king to the throne, from whence he had
been expelled by an unnatural u&s;urper. He employed the
prie&s;ts to enforce his exhortations; to a&s;&s;ure the men that
they might depend upon the prayers of the church; and
that, in ca&s;e they &s;hould fall in battle, the &s;aints and
angels would convey their &s;ouls to heaven. They are &s;aid
to have &s;worn upon the &s;acrament, that they would not
de&s;ert their colours, and to have received an order that no
quarter &s;hould be given to the French hereticks in the
army of the Prince of Orange. Ginckel had encamped
on the Ro&s;common &s;ide of the river Suc, within three
miles of the enemy: after having reconnoitred their
po&s;ture, he re&s;olved, with the advice of a council of war,
to attack them on Sunday the twelfth day of July. The
nece&s;&s;ary orders being given, the army pa&s;&s;ed the river at
two fords and a &s;tone bridge, and, advancing to the edge
of the great bog, began about twelve o'clock to force the
two pa&s;&s;ages, in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s the ground on the other
&s;ide. The enemy fought with &s;urpri&s;ing fury, and the
hor&s;e were &s;everal times repul&s;ed; but, at length, the
troops upon the right carried their point by means of &s;ome
field pieces. The day was now &s;o far advanced, that the
General determined to po&s;tpone the battle till next morn|ing;
but, perceiving &s;ome di&s;order among the enemy, and
fearing they would decamp in the night, he altered his
re&s;olution, and ordered the attack to be renewed. At &s;ix
o'clock in the evening the left wing of the Engli&s;h ad|vanced
to the right of the Iri&s;h, from whom they met
with &s;uch a warm and ob&s;tinate reception, that it was not
without the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing efforts of courage and per&s;e|verance
<PB N="122" REF="126">
that they at length obliged them to give ground;
and even then they lo&s;t it by inches. St. Ruth, &s;eeing
them in danger of being overpowered, immediately de|tached
&s;uccours to them from his centre and left wing.
Mackay no &s;ooner perceived them weakened by the&s;e de|tachments,
than he ordered three battalions to &s;kirt the
bog, and attack them on the left, while the centre ad|vanced
through the middle of the mora&s;s, the men wading
up to the wai&s;t in mud and water. After they had reached
the other &s;ide, they found them&s;elves obliged to a&s;cend a
rugged hill, fenced with hedges and ditches; and the&s;e
were lined with mu&s;queteers, &s;upported at proper inter|vals
with &s;quadrons of cavalry. They made &s;uch a de&s;pe|rate
re&s;i&s;tance, and fought with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that
the a&s;&s;ailants were repul&s;ed into the middle of the bog with
great lo&s;s, and St. Ruth exclaimed&mdash;&startq;Now will I drive
the Engli&s;h to the gates of Dublin.&endq; In this critical
conjuncture Ptolemache came up with a fre&s;h body to
&s;u&s;tain them, rallied the broken troops, and renewed the
charge with &s;uch vigour, that the Iri&s;h gave way in their
turn, and the Engli&s;h recovered the ground they had lo&s;t,
though they found it impo&s;&s;ible to improve their advantage.
Mackay brought a body of hor&s;e and dragoons to the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the left wing, and fir&s;t turned the tide of battle
in favour of the Engli&s;h. Major-General Rouvigny, who
had behaved with great gallantry during the whole action,
advanced with five regiments of cavalry to &s;upport the
centre, when St. Ruth perceiving his de&s;ign, re&s;olved to
fall upon him in a dangerous hollow way, which he was
obliged to pa&s;s. For this purpo&s;e, he began to de&s;cend
Kircommodon-hill with his whole re&s;erve of hor&s;e: but
in his way was killed by a cannon-ball. His troops imme|diately
halted, and his guards retreated with his body.
His fate di&s;pirited the troops, and produced &s;uch confu&s;ion
as Sarsfield could not remedy; for though he was next i$
command, he had been at variance with St. Ruth &s;inc$
the affair at Athlone, and was ignorant of the plan he
had concerted. Rouvigny, having pa&s;&s;ed the hollow wa$
<PB N="123" REF="127">
without oppo&s;ition, charged the enemy in flank, and bore
down all before him with &s;urpri&s;ing impetuo&s;ity: the
centre redoubled their efforts, and pu&s;hed the Iri&s;h to the
top of the hill, and then the whole line giving way at
once from right to left, threw down their arms. The foot
fled towards a bog in their rear, and their hor&s;e took the
route by the highway to Loughneagh: both were pur&s;ued
by the Engli&s;h cavalry, who for four miles made a terrible
&s;laughter. In the battle, which la&s;ted two hours, and in
the pur&s;uit, above four thou&s;and of the enemy were &s;lain,
and &s;ix hundred taken, together with all their baggage,
tents, provi&s;ion, ammunition, and artillery, nine-and-twenty
pair of colours, twelve &s;tandards, and almo&s;t all
the arms of the infantry. In a word, the victory was
deci&s;ive, and not above eight hundred of the Engli&s;h were
killed upon the field of battle. The vanqui&s;hed retreated
in great confu&s;ion to Limerick, where they re&s;olved to
make a final &s;tand, in hope of receiving &s;uch &s;uccours
from France as would either enable them to retrieve their
affairs, or obtain good terms from the court of England.
There Tyrconnel died of a broken heart, after having
&s;urvived his authority and reputation. He had incurred
the contempt of the French, as well as the hatred of the
Iri&s;h, whom he had advi&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the new govern|ment,
rather than totally ruin them&s;elves and their fa|milies.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. Immediately after the battle, detachments were
&s;ent to reduce Portumny, Bonnachar, and Moor-ca&s;tle,
con&s;iderable pa&s;&s;es on the Shannon, which were accord|ingly
&s;ecured. Then Ginckel advanced to Galway, which
he &s;ummoned to &s;urrender; but he received a defiance from
Lord Dillon and General D'U&s;&s;one, who commanded the
garri&s;on. The trenches were immediately opened; a
fort which commanded the approaches to the town was
taken by a&s;&s;ault; &s;ix regiments of foot, and four &s;qua|drons
of hor&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed the river on pontoons; and the
place being wholly inve&s;ted, the governor thought proper
to capitulate. The garri&s;on marched out with the honours
<PB N="124" REF="128">
of war, and was allowed &s;afe-conduct to Limerick.
Ginckel directed his march to the &s;ame town, which was
the only po&s;t of con&s;equence that now held out for King
James. Within four miles of the place he halted, until
the heavy cannon could be brought from Athlone. Hear|ing
that Luttrel had been &s;ei&s;ed by the French general
D'U&s;&s;one, and &s;entenced to be &s;hot for having propo&s;ed
to &s;urrender, he &s;ent a trumpet, to tell the commander,
that if any per&s;on &s;hould be put to death for &s;uch a pro|po&s;al,
he would make retaliation on the Iri&s;h pri&s;oners.
On the twenty-fifth day of Augu&s;t the enemy were driven
from all their advanced po&s;ts: Captain Cole, with a &s;qua|dron
of &s;hips, &s;ailed up the Shannon, and his frigates an|chored
in &s;ight of the town. On the twenty-&s;ixth day of
the month the batteries were opened, and a line of con|travallation
was formed: the Iri&s;h army lay encamped on
the other &s;ide of the river, on the road to Killalow, and
the fords were guarded with four regiments of their dra|goons.
On the fifth day of September, after the town had
been almo&s;t laid in ruins by the bombs, and large breaches
made in the walls by the battering cannon, the guns were
di&s;mounted, the out forts evacuated, and &s;uch other
motions made as indicated a re&s;olution to abandon the
&s;iege. The enemy expre&s;&s;ed their joy in loud acclama|tions;
but this was of &s;hort continuance. In the night
the be&s;iegers began to throw a bridge of pontoons over the
river, about a mile higher up than the camp; and this
work was fini&s;hed before morning. A con&s;iderable body
of hor&s;e and foot had pa&s;&s;ed when the alarm was given
to the enemy, who were &s;ei&s;ed with &s;uch con&s;ternation,
that they threw down their arms, and betook them&s;elves to
flight, leaving behind them their tents, baggage, two
pieces of cannon, and one &s;tandard. The bridge was
immediately removed nearer the town, and forti$ied: all
the fords and pa&s;&s;es were &s;ecured, and the batteries con|tinued
firing ince&s;&s;antly till the twenty-&s;econd day of the
month, when Ginckel pa&s;&s;ed over with a divi&s;ion of the
army, and fourteen pieces of cannon. About four in the
<PB N="125" REF="129">
afternoon, the grenadiers attacked the forts that com|manded
Thomond-bridge, and carried them &s;word in
hand, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance. The garri&s;on had
made a &s;ally from the town to &s;upport them; and this
detachment was driven back with &s;uch precipitation, that
the French officer on command in that quarter, fearing
the Engli&s;h would enter pell-mell with the fugitives,
ordered the bridge to be drawn up, leaving his own men
to the fury of a victorious enemy. Six hundred were
killed, two hundred taken pri&s;oners, including many of|ficers,
and a great number were drowned in the Shannon.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. Then the Engli&s;h made a lodgment within ten
paces of the bridge-foot; and the Iri&s;h, &s;eeing them&s;elves
&s;urrounded on all &s;ides, determined to capitulate. General
Sarsfield and Colonel Wahop &s;ignified their re&s;olution to
Scravenmore and Rouvigny: ho&s;tages were exchanged;
&agrave; negociation was immediately begun, and ho&s;tilities
cea&s;ed on both &s;ides of the river. The Lords Ju&s;tices
arrived in the camp on the fir&s;t day of October, and on
the fourth the capitulation was executed, extending to all
all the places in the kingdom that were &s;till in the hands
of the Iri&s;h. The Roman catholics were re&s;tored to the
enjoyment of &s;uch liberty in the exerci&s;e of religion as was
con&s;i&s;tent with the laws of Ireland, and conformable
with that which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the reign of Charles II.
All per&s;ons whatever were entitled to the protection of
the&s;e laws, and re&s;tored to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their e&s;tates,
privileges, and immunities, upon their &s;ubmitting to the
pre&s;ent government, and taking the oath of allegiance to
their Maje&s;ties King William and Queen Mary, except|ing,
however, certain per&s;ons who were forfeited or exiled.
This article even extended to all merchants of Limerick,
or any other garri&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Iri&s;h, who happened
to be abroad, and had not born arms &s;ince the declara|tion
in the fir&s;t year of the pre&s;ent reign, provided they
&s;hould return within the term of eight months. All the
per&s;ons compri&s;ed in this and the foregoing article were
indulged with a general pardon of all attainders, out|lawries,
<PB N="126" REF="130">
trea&s;ons, mi&s;pri&s;ions of trea&s;on, premunires, fel$$nies,
tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, and other crimes and mi&s;demeanors what$&s;oever,
committed &s;ince the beginning of the reign of Jame$
II. and the Lords Ju&s;tices promi&s;ed to u&s;e their be&s;t e$$deavours
towards the rever&s;al of &s;uch attainders and out|lawries
as had pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t any of them in parliament$
In order to allay the violence of party, and extingui&s;$
private animo&s;ities, it was agreed, that no per&s;on &s;houl$
be &s;ued or impleaded on either &s;ide, for any tre&s;pa&s;s, o$
made accountable for the rents, tenements, lands, or hou&s;es
he had received or enjoyed &s;ince the beginning of th$
war. Every nobleman and gentleman compri&s;ed in the$
articles was authori&s;ed to keep a &s;word, a ca&s;e of pi&s;tol$
and a gun for his defence or amu&s;ement. The inhabitan$
of Limerick and other garri&s;ons, were permitted to re$move
their goods and chattels, without &s;earch, vi&s;itation
or payment of duty. The Lords Ju&s;tices promi&s;ed to u&s;$
their be&s;t endeavours, that all per&s;ons comprehended $word$
this capitulation &s;hould for eight months be protecte$
from all arre&s;ts and executions for debt or damage: the$
undertook, that their Maje&s;ties &s;hould ratify the&s;e article$
within the &s;pace of eight months, and u&s;e their endeavour
that they might be ratified and confirmed in parliament
The &s;ub&s;equent article was calculated to indemnify Col$
John Brown, who&s;e e&s;tate and effects had been &s;ei&s;ed fo$
the u&s;e of the Iri&s;h army by Tyrconnel and Sarsfield
which la&s;t had been created Lord Lucan by King James
and was now mentioned by that title. All per&s;ons wer$
indulged with free leave to remove with their families an$
effects to any other country, except England and Scotland&punc;
All officers and &s;oldiers in the &s;ervice of King James
comprehending even the Rapparees, willing to go beyon$
&s;ea, were at liberty to march in bodies to the places o$
embarkation, to be conveyed to the continent with the
French officers and troops. They were furni&s;hed with
pa&s;&s;ports, convoys, and carriages by land and water; and
General Ginckel engaged to provide &s;eventy &s;hips, if ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
for their tran&s;portation, with two men of war for
<PB N="127" REF="131">
the accommodation of their officers, and to &s;erve as a
convoy to the fleet. It was &s;tipulated, That the provi&s;ions
and forage for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould be paid for on their
arrival in France: That ho&s;tages &s;hould be given for this
indemnification, as well as for the return of their &s;hips:
That all the garri&s;ons &s;hould march out of their re&s;pective
towns and fortre&s;&s;es with the honours of war: That the
Iri&s;h &s;hould have liberty to tran&s;port nine hundred hor&s;es:
That tho&s;e who &s;hould choo&s;e to &s;tay behind, might di&s;|po&s;e
of them&s;elves according to their own fancy, after
having &s;urrendered their arms to &s;uch commi&s;&s;ioners as
the General &s;hould appoint: That all pri&s;oners of war
&s;hould be &s;et at liberty on both &s;ides: That the General
&s;hould provide two ve&s;&s;els to carry over two different
per&s;ons to France, with intimation of this treaty; and
that none of tho&s;e who were willing to quit the kingdom
&s;hould be detained on account of debt, or any other pre|tence.&mdash;
This is the &s;ub&s;tance of the famous treaty of
Limerick, which the Iri&s;h Roman catholics con&s;ider as
the great charter of their civil and religious liberties. The
town of Limerick was &s;urrendered to Ginckel; but both
&s;ides agreed, that the two armies &s;hould entrench them|&s;elves,
till the Iri&s;h could embark, that no di&s;orders
might ari&s;e from a communication.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. The prote&s;tant &s;ubjects of Ireland were ex|tremely
di&s;gu&s;ted at the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions made in favour of
vanqui&s;hed rebels, who had exerci&s;ed &s;uch acts of cruelty
and rapine. They complained, that they them&s;elves,
who had &s;uffered for their loyalty to King William, were
neglected, and obliged to &s;it down with their lo&s;&s;es, while
their enemies, who had &s;hed &s;o much blood in oppo&s;ing
his government, were indemnified by the articles of the
capitulation, and even favoured with particular indulgen|cies.
They were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with the honours of war:
they were tran&s;ported at the government's expence, to
fight again&s;t the Engli&s;h in foreign countries: an honour|able
provi&s;ion was made for the Rapparees, who were
profe&s;&s;ed banditti; the Roman catholic intere&s;t in Ireland
<PB N="128" REF="132">
obtained the &s;anction of regal authority: attainders were
overlooked, forfeitures annulled, pardons extended, and
laws &s;et a&s;ide, in order to effect a pacification. Ginckel
had received orders to put an end to the war at any rate,
that William might convert his whole influence and at|tention
to the affairs of the continent. When the arti|cles
of capitulation were ratified, and ho&s;tages exchanged
for their being duly executed, about two thou&s;and Iri&s;h
foot, and three hundred hor&s;e, began their march for
Cork, where they propo&s;ed to take &s;hipping for France,
under the conduct of Sarsfield: but, three regiments re|fu&s;ing
to quit the kingdom, delivered up their arms, and
di&s;per&s;ed to their former habitations. Tho&s;e who remained
at Limerick embarked on the &s;eventh day of November,
in French tran&s;ports; and &s;ailed immediately to France,
under convoy of a French &s;quadron which had arrived in
the bay of Dingle immediately after the capitulation
was &s;igned. Twelve thou&s;and men cho&s;e to under|go
exile from their native country, rather than &s;ubmit to
the government of King William. When they arrived
in France, they were welcomed by a letter from James,
who thanked them for their loyalty; a&s;&s;ured them they
&s;hould &s;till &s;erve under his commi&s;&s;ion and command;
and that the King of France had already given orders for
their being new clothed, and put into quarters of refre&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. The reduction of Ireland being thus completed,
Baron Ginckel returned to England, where he was &s;o|lemnly
thanked by the Hou&s;e of Commons for his great
&s;ervices, after he had been created Earl of Athlone by his
Maje&s;ty. When the parliament met on the twenty-&s;econd
day of October, the King in his &s;peech, in&s;i&s;ted
upon the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending a &s;trong fleet to &s;ea, early
iu the &s;ea&s;on, and of maintaining a con&s;iderable army, to
annoy the enemy abroad, as well as to protect the king|dom
from in&s;ult and inva&s;ion; for which purpo&s;es, he
&s;aid, &s;ixty-five thou&s;and men would be barely &s;ufficient.
Each hou&s;e pre&s;ented an addre&s;s of congratulation upon
<PB N="129" REF="133">
his Maje&s;ty's &s;afe return to England, and on the reduction
of Ireland: they promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him to the utmo&s;t of
their power, in pro&s;ecuting the war with France; and, at
the &s;ame time, drew up addre&s;&s;es to the Queen, acknow|ledging
her prudent admini&s;tration during his Maje&s;ty's
ab&s;ence. Notwith&s;tanding this appearance of cordiality
and complai&s;ance, a &s;pirit of di&s;content had in&s;inuated
it&s;elf into both Hou&s;es of Parliament, and even infected
great part of the nation.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. A great number of individuals, who wi&s;hed
well to their country, could not, without anxiety and
re&s;entment, behold the intere&s;t of the nation &s;acrificed to
foreign connections, and the King's favour &s;o partially
be&s;towed upon Dutchmen, in prejudice to his Engli&s;h
&s;ubjects. They ob&s;erved, that the number of forces he
demanded was con&s;iderably greater than that of any army
which had ever been paid by the publick, even when the
nation was in the mo&s;t imminent danger: that, in&s;tead of
contributing as allies to the maintenance of the war upon
the continent, they had embarked as principals, and bore
the greate&s;t part of the burthen, though they had the lea&s;t
&s;hare of the profit. They even in&s;inuated, that &s;uch a
&s;tanding army was more calculated to make the King
ab&s;olute at home, than to render him formidable abroad;
and the &s;ecret friends of the late King did not fail to en|force
the&s;e in&s;inuations. They renewed their animad|ver&s;ions
upon the di&s;agreeable part of his character: they
dwelt upon his proud re&s;erve, his &s;ullen &s;ilence, his im|perious
di&s;po&s;ition, and his ba&s;e ingratitude, particularly
to the Earl of Marlborough, whom he had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from
all his employments, immediately after the &s;ignal exploits
he had performed in Ireland. The di&s;grace of this noble|man
was partly a&s;cribed to the freedom with which he
had complained of the King's undervaluing his &s;ervices,
and partly to the intrigues of his wife, who had gained an
a&s;cendency over the Prince&s;s Anne of Denmark, and is
&s;aid to have employed her influence in fomenting a jealou&s;y
between the two &s;i&s;ters. The malcontents of the whiggi&s;h
<PB N="130" REF="134">
faction, enraged to find their credit declining at court,
joined in the cry which the Jacobites had rai&s;ed again&s;t
the government. They &s;crupled not to &s;ay, that the arts
of corruption were &s;hamefully practi&s;ed, to &s;ecure a ma|jority
in parliament: that the King was as tender of the
prerogative as any of his predece&s;&s;ors had ever been; and,
that he even ventured to admit Jacobites into his council,
becau&s;e they were the known tools of arbitrary power.
The&s;e reflections alluded to the Earls of Roche&s;ter and
Ranelagh, who, with Sir Edward Seymour, had been
lately created privy-coun&s;ellors. Roche&s;ter entertained
very high notions of regal authority: he propo&s;ed &s;everity
as one of the be&s;t &s;upports of government; was clear in his
under&s;tanding, violent in his temper, and incorrupt in his
principles. Ranelagh was a man of parts and plea&s;ure,
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t plau&s;ible and winning addre&s;s;
and was capable of tran&s;acting the mo&s;t important and
intricate affairs, in the mid&s;t of riot and debauchery. He
had managed the revenue of Ireland in the reign of
Charles II. He enjoyed the office of pay-ma&s;ter in the
army of King James; and now maintained the &s;ame
footing under the government of William and Mary.
Sir Edward Seymour was the proude&s;t commoner in
England, and the bolde&s;t orator that ever filled the
Speaker's chair. He was intimately acquainted with the
bu&s;ine&s;s of the Hou&s;e, and knew every individual mem|ber
&s;o exactly, that with one glance of his eye he could
progno&s;ticate the fate of every motion. He had oppo&s;ed
the court with great acrimony, que&s;tioned the King's
title, cen&s;ured his conduct, and reflected upon his cha|racter.
Neverthele&s;s, he now became a pro&s;elyte, and
was brought into the Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. The Commons voted three millions, four
hundred and eleven thou&s;and, &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy-five
pounds for the u&s;e of the en&s;uing year: but, the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of funds for rai&s;ing the&s;e &s;upplies was re|tarded,
partly by the ill-humour of the oppo&s;ition, and
partly by intervening affairs that diverted the attention of
<PB N="131" REF="135">
the Commons. Several eminent merchants pre&s;ented a
petition to the Hou&s;e again&s;t the Ea&s;t-India Company,
charging them with manifold abu&s;es; at the &s;ame time, a
counter-petition was delivered by the Company, and the
affair referred to the examination of a committee appointed
for that purpo&s;e. After a minute enquiry into the nature
of the complaints, the Commons voted certain regulations
with re&s;pect to the &s;tock and the traffick; and re&s;olved to
petition his Maje&s;ty, that, according to the &s;aid regula|tions,
the Ea&s;t-India Company &s;hould be incorporated by
charter. The committee was ordered to bring in a bill
for this e&s;tabli&s;hment: but divers petitions being pre&s;ented
again&s;t it, and the Company's an&s;wers proving un&s;atis|factory,
the Hou&s;e addre&s;&s;ed the King to di&s;&s;olve it, and
grant a charter to a new company. He &s;aid, it was an
affair of great importance to the trade of the kingdom;
therefore, he would con&s;ider the &s;ubject, and in a little
time return a po&s;itive an&s;wer. The parliament was like|wi&s;e
amu&s;ed by a pretended con&s;piracy of the papi&s;ts in
Lanca&s;hire, to rai&s;e a rebellion, and re&s;tore James to the
throne. Several per&s;ons were &s;ei&s;ed, and &s;ome witne&s;&s;es
examined: but nothing appeared to ju&s;tify the infor|mation.
At length, one Fuller, a pri&s;oner in the King's
Bench, offered his evidence, and was brought to the bar
of the Hou&s;e of Commons, where he produced &s;ome
papers. He obtained a blank pa&s;s from the King for two
per&s;ons, who, he &s;aid, would come from the continent to
give evidence. He was afterwards examined at his own
lodgings, where he affirmed, that Colonel Thomas Dela|val,
and James Hayes, were the witne&s;&s;es for whom he
had procured the pa&s;s and the protection. Search was
made for them, according to his direction: but no &s;uch
per&s;ons were found. Then the Hou&s;e declared Fuller a
notorious impo&s;tor, cheat, and fal&s;e accu&s;er. He was, at
the reque&s;t of the Commons, pro&s;ecuted by the Attorney-General,
and &s;entenced to &s;tand in the pillory; a di&s;|grace,
which he accordingly underwent.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="136">
&sect; XVII. A bill for regulating trials in ca&s;es of high-trea&s;on
having been laid a&s;ide by the Lords in the pre|ceding
&s;e&s;&s;ion, was now again brought upon the carpet,
and pa&s;&s;ed the Lower Hou&s;e. The de&s;ign of this bill
was to &s;ecure the &s;ubject from the rigours to which he
had been expo&s;ed in the late reigns. It provided, That
the pri&s;oner &s;hould be furni&s;hed with a copy of his in|dictment,
as al&s;o of the pannel, ten days before his trial;
and, That his witne&s;&s;es &s;hould be examined upon oath,
as well as tho&s;e of the crown. The Lords, in their own
behalf, added a clau&s;e, enacting, That upon the trial of
any peer or peere&s;s, for trea&s;on or mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on,
all the peers who have a right to &s;it and vote in parlia|ment
&s;hould be duely &s;ummoned to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the trial:
That this notice &s;hould be given twenty days before the
trial: and, That every peer &s;o &s;ummoned, and appear|ing,
&s;hould vote upon the occa&s;ion. The Commons re|jected
this amendment; and a free conference en&s;ued.
The point was argued with great vivacity on both &s;ides,
which &s;erved only to inflame the di&s;pute, and render each
party the more tenacious of their own opinion. After
three conferences that produced nothing but animo&s;ity,
the bill was dropped; for the Commons re&s;olved to bear
the hard&s;hips of which they complained, rather than be
relieved at the expence of purcha&s;ing a new privilege to
the Lords: and without this advantage, the peers would
not contribute to their relief.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. The next object that engro&s;&s;ed the attention
of the Lower Hou&s;e, was the mi&s;carriage of the $leet
during the &s;ummer's expedition. Admiral Ru&s;&s;el, who
commanded at &s;ea, having been joined by a Dutch &s;qua|dron,
&s;ailed in que&s;t of the enemy: but, as the French
King had received undoubted intelligence, that the com|bined
&s;quadrons were &s;uperior to his navy in number of
&s;hips and weight of metal, he ordered Tourville to avoid
an engagement. This officer acted with &s;uch vigilance,
caution, and dexterity, as baffled all the endeavours of
Ru&s;&s;el, who was, moreover, perplexed with ob&s;cure and

contradictory orders. Neverthele&s;s, he crui&s;ed all &s;ummer,
either in the channel or in &s;oundings, for the protection
of the trade, and, in particular, &s;ecured the homeward-bound
Smyrna fleet, in which the Engli&s;h and Dutch had
a joint concern, amounting to four millions &s;terling.
Having &s;coured the channel, and &s;ailed along great part of the
French coa&s;t, he returned to Torbay in the beginning
of Augu&s;t, and received fre&s;h orders to put to &s;ea again,
notwith&s;tanding his repeated remon&s;trances again&s;t ex|po&s;ing
large &s;hips to the &s;torms that always blow about
the time of the equinox. He, therefore, &s;ailed back to
&s;oundings, where he continued crui&s;ing till the &s;econd day
of September, when he was overtaken by a violent tempe&s;t,
which drove him into the channel, and obliged him to
make for the port of Plymouth. The weather being
hazy, he reached the Sound with great difficulty: the
Coronation, a &s;econd-rate, foundered at anchor off the
Ram-Head: the Harwich, a third-rate, bulged upon the
rocks, and peri&s;hed: two others ran a&s;hore, but were got
off with little damage: but the whole fleet was &s;cattered
and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. The nation murmured at the &s;uppo&s;ed
mi&s;conduct of the Admiral, and the Commons &s;ubjected
him to an enquiry: but, when they examined his papers,
orders, and in&s;tructions, they perceived he had adhered to
them with great punctuality, and thought proper to drop
the pro&s;ecution, out of tenderne&s;s to the mini&s;try. Then
the Hou&s;e took into con&s;ideration &s;ome letters which had
been intercepted in a French &s;hip taken by Sir Ralph

them. Crew ab&s;conded, but Lord Dartmouth was com|mitted
to the Tower. Lord Pre&s;ton was examined touch|ing

they had granted, and communicating his intention of
repairing &s;peedily to the continent. Then the two
Hou&s;es, at his de&s;ire, adjourned them&s;elves to the twelfth

At this period, Charles Montagu, afterwards Earl of Hallifax, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the Hou&s;e of Commons by his fine talents and eloquence.

by his complai&s;ance to the pre&s;byterians of Scot|land,
and was &s;o di&s;plea&s;ed with the conduct of that &s;tub|born
&s;ect of religioni&s;ts, that he thought proper to admit
&s;ome prelati&s;ts into the admini&s;tration. John&s;ton, who
had been &s;ent envoy to the Elector of Brandenburgh, was
recalled, and with the Ma&s;ter of Stair, made joint &s;ecre|tary
of Scotland; Melvill, who had declined in his im|portance,
was made Lord Privy-Seal of that kingdom:

Tweedale was con&s;tituted Lord Chancellor: Crawfurd
retained the office of pre&s;ident of the council; and Lo|thian
was appointed high commi&s;&s;ioner to the general
a&s;&s;embly. The parliament was adjourned to the fifteenth
day of April, becau&s;e it was not yet compliant enough to
be a&s;&s;embled with &s;afety; and the epi&s;copal clergy were
admitted to a &s;hare of the church-government. The&s;e
mea&s;ures, in&s;tead of healing the divi&s;ions, &s;erved only to
enflame the animo&s;ity of the two parties. The epi&s;|copalians
triumphed in the King's favour, and began to
treat their antagoni&s;ts with in&s;olence and &s;corn: the pre|&s;byterians
were incen&s;ed to &s;ee their friends di&s;graced, and
their enemies di&s;tingui&s;hed by the royal indulgence. They
in&s;i&s;ted upon the authority of the law, which happened
to be upon their &s;ide: they became more than ever &s;our,
&s;urly, and implacable: they refu&s;ed to concur with the
prelati&s;ts, or abate in the lea&s;t circum&s;tance of di&s;cipline;
and the a&s;&s;embly was di&s;&s;olved, without any time or place
a&s;&s;igned for the next meeting. The pre&s;byterians pre|tended
an independent right of a&s;&s;embling annually, even
without a call from his Maje&s;ty; they therefore adjourned
them&s;elves, after having prote&s;ted again&s;t the di&s;&s;olution.
The King re&s;ented this mea&s;ure, as an in&s;olent inva&s;ion of
the prerogative, and conceived an aver&s;ion to the whole
&s;ect, who in their turn began to lo&s;e all re&s;pect for his
per&s;on and government.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. As the Highlanders were not yet totally reduced,
the Earl of Breadalbane undertook to bring them over,
by di&s;tributing &s;ums of money among their chiefs; and
fifteen thou&s;and pounds were remitted from England for
this purpo&s;e. The clans being informed of this remit|tance,
&s;u&s;pected that the Earl's de&s;ign was to appropriate
to him&s;elf the be&s;t part of the money, and when he began
to treat with them made &s;uch extravagant demands, that
he found his &s;cheme impracticable. He was, therefore,
obliged to refund the &s;um he had received; and he re|&s;olved
to wreak his vengeance with the fir&s;t opportunity, on
tho&s;e who had fru&s;trated his intention. He who chiefly
<PB N="136" REF="140">
thwarted his negociation, was Macdonald of Glencoe
who&s;e oppo&s;ition ro&s;e from a private circum&s;tance, which
ought to have had no effect upon a treaty that regarded
the publick weal. Macdonald had plundered the lands of
Breadalbane during the cour&s;e of ho&s;tilities; and this
nobleman in&s;i&s;ted upon being indemnified for his lo&s;&s;es,
from the other's &s;hare of the money which he was em|ployed
to di&s;tribute. The Highlander not only refu&s;ed to
acquie&s;ce in the&s;e terms, but, by his influence among the
clans, defeated the whole &s;cheme, and the Earl in revenge
devoted him to de&s;truction. King William had by pro|clamation
offered an indemnity to all tho&s;e who had been
in arms again&s;t him, provided they would &s;ubmit, and
take the oaths, by a certain day; and this was prolonged
to the clo&s;e of the pre&s;ent year, with a denunciation of
military execution again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould hold out after
the end of December. Macdonald, intimidated by this
declaration, repaired on the very la&s;t day of the month to
Fort-William, and de&s;ired that the oaths might be tender|ed
to him by Colonel Hill, governor of that fortre&s;s. As
this officer was not ve&s;ted with the power of a civil magi|&s;trate,
he refu&s;ed to admini&s;ter them; and Macdonald
&s;et out immediately for Inverary, the county-town of
Argyle. Though the ground was covered with &s;now,
and the weather inten&s;ely cold, he travelled with &s;uch
diligence, that the term pre&s;cribed by the proclamation
was but one day elap&s;ed when he reached the place, and
addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Sir John Campbell, &s;heriff of the
county, who, in con&s;ideration of his di&s;appointment at
Fort-William, was prevailed upon to admini&s;ter the oaths
to him and his adherents. Then they returned to their
own habitations in the valley of Glencoe, in full confi|dence
of being protected by the government, to which
they had &s;o &s;olemnly &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. Breadalbane had repre&s;ented Macdonald at court
as an incorrigible rebel, as a ruffian inured to blood&s;hed
and rapine, who would never be obedient to the laws of
his country, nor live peaceably under any &s;overeign. He
<PB N="137" REF="141">
ob&s;erved that he had paid no regard to the proclamation,
and propo&s;ed that the government &s;hould &s;acrifice him to
the quiet of the kingdom, in extirpating him, with his
family and dependents, by military execution. His ad|vice
was &s;upported by the &s;ugge&s;tions of the other Scotti&s;h
mini&s;ters; and the King, who&s;e chief virtue was not hu|manity,
&s;igned a warrant for the de&s;truction of tho&s;e un|happy
people, though it does not appear that he knew of
Macdonald's &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. An order for this barbarous
execution, &s;igned and counter-&s;igned by his Maje&s;ty's
own hand, being tran&s;mitted to the Ma&s;ter of Stair, &s;ecre|tary
for Scotland, this mini&s;ter &s;ent particular directions
to Living&s;tone, who commanded the troops in that king|dom,
to put the inhabitants of Glencoe to the &s;word,
charging him to take no pri&s;oners, that the &s;cene might
be more terrible. In the month of February, Captain
Campbell, of Glenlyon, by virtue of an order from
Major Duncan&s;on, marched into the valley of Glencoe,
with a company of &s;oldiers belonging to Argyle's regiment,
on pretence of levying the arrears of the land-tax and
hearth-money. When Macdonald demanded whether
they came as friends or enemies, he an&s;wered as friends,
and promi&s;ed, upon his honour, that neither he nor his
people &s;hould &s;u&s;tain the lea&s;t injury. In con&s;equence of
this declaration, he and his men were received with the
mo&s;t cordial ho&s;pitality, and lived fifteen days with the
men of the valley, in all the appearance of the mo&s;t unre|&s;erved
friend&s;hip. At length the fatal period approached.
Macdonald and Campbell having pa&s;&s;ed the day together,
parted about &s;even in the evening, with mutual profe&s;&s;ions
of the warme&s;t affection. The younger Macdonald, per|ceiving
the guards doubled, began to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome
treachery, and communicated his &s;u&s;picion to his brother;
but neither he nor the father would harbour the lea&s;t
doubt of Campbell's &s;incerity: neverthele&s;s, the two
young men went forth privately, to make further ob&s;erva|tions.
They overheard the common &s;oldiers &s;ay they
liked not the work; that though they would have wil|lingly
<PB N="138" REF="142">
&s;ought the Macdonalds of the Glen fairly in the
field, they held it ba&s;e to murther them in cool blood,
but that their officers were an&s;werable for the treachery.
When the youths ha&s;ted back to appri&s;e their father of
the impending danger, they &s;aw the hou&s;e already &s;ur|rounded:
they heard the di&s;charge of mu&s;kets, the &s;hrieks
of women and children, and, being de&s;titute of arms,
&s;ecured their own lives by immediate flight. The &s;avage
mini&s;ters of vengeance had entered the old man's chamber,
and &s;hot him through the head. He fell down dead in
the arms of his wife, who died next day, di&s;tracted by
the horror of her hu&s;band's fate. The Laird of Auchin|trincken,
Macdonald's gue&s;t, who had three months before
this period &s;ubmitted to the government, and at this very
time had a protection in his pocket, was put to death
without que&s;tion. A boy of eight years, who fell at
Campbell's feet, imploring mercy, and offering to &s;erve
him for life, was &s;tabbed to the heart by one Drummond,
a &s;ubaltern officer. Eight-and-thirty per&s;ons &s;uffered in
this manner, the greater part of whom were &s;urpri&s;ed in
their beds, and hurried into eternity before they had time
to implore the divine mercy. The de&s;ign was to butche$
all the males under &s;eventy that lived in the valley, the
number of whom amounted to two hundred; but &s;ome of
the detachments did not arrive &s;oon enough to &s;ecure the
pa&s;&s;es; &s;o that one hundred and &s;ixty e&s;caped. Campbell
having perpetrated this brutal ma&s;&s;acre; ordered all the
hou&s;es to be burned, made a prey of all the cattle and
effects that were found in the valley, and left the helple&s;s
women and children, who&s;e fathers and hu&s;bands he ha$
murthered, naked and forlorn, without covering, food
or &s;helter, in the mid&s;t of the &s;now that covered th$
whole face of the country, at the di&s;tance of &s;ix long
miles from any inhabited place. Di&s;tracted with grie$
and horror, &s;urrounded with the &s;hades of night, &s;hivering
with cold, and appalled with the apprehen&s;ion of imme|diate
death from the &s;words of tho&s;e who had &s;acrifice$
their friends and kin&s;men, they could not endure &s;uch
<PB N="139" REF="143">
complication of calamities, but generally peri&s;hed in the
wa&s;te, before they could receive the lea&s;t comfort or a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.
This barbarous ma&s;&s;acre, performed under the
&s;anction of King William's authority, an&s;wered the imme|diate
purpo&s;e of the court, by &s;triking terrour into the
hearts of the Jacobite Highlanders: but, at the &s;ame
time, excited the horrour of all tho&s;e who had not re|$ounced
every &s;entiment of humanity, and produced &s;uch
$n aver&s;ion to the government, as all the arts of a mi|ni&s;try
could never totally &s;urmount. A detail of the par|$$culars
was publi&s;hed at Paris, with many exaggerations,
$nd the Jacobites did not fail to expatiate upon every
circum&s;tance, in dome&s;tic libels and private conver&s;ation.
The King alarmed at the outcry which was rai&s;ed upon
$his occa&s;ion, ordered an enquiry to be &s;et on foot, and
$i&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Ma&s;ter of Stair from his employment of
$ecretary:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Story. Kennet. Life of King William. Nav. Hi&s;t. Ralph. Voltaire.</NOTE> he likewi&s;e pretended that he had &s;ub&s;cribed

for an opportunity to declare in behalf of their

$e dome&s;tick affairs of the nation, and exerted uncom|$on
care and a&s;&s;iduity in equipping a formidable &s;leet,
$mbarked for Holland on the fifth day of March, and

One Lant, who was impri&s;oned on &s;u&s;picion of di&s;tri|buting
his commi&s;&s;ions, had the good fortune to be re|lea&s;ed,
and the papi&s;ts of Lanca&s;hire di&s;patched him to
the court of St. Germain's, with an a&s;&s;urance that they
were in a condition to receive their old &s;overeign. He
returned with advice that King James would certainly land
in the &s;pring; and that Colonel Parker and other officers
&s;hould be &s;ent over with full in&s;tructions, touching their
conduct at and before the King's arrival. Parker accord|ingly
repaired to England, and made the Jacobites ac|quainted
with the whole &s;cheme of a de&s;cent, which Louis
had actually concerted with the late King. He a&s;&s;ured
them, that their lawful &s;overeign would once more vi&s;it
his Briti&s;h dominions, at the head of thirty thou&s;and
effective men, to be embarked at La Hogue; that the
tran&s;ports were already prepared, and a &s;trong &s;quadron
equipped for their convoy; he, therefore, exhorted them
to be &s;peedy and &s;ecret in their preparations, that they
might be in readine&s;s to take arms, and co-operate in ef|fecting
his re&s;toration. This officer, and one John&s;on, a
prie&s;t, are &s;aid to have undertaken the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination o$
King William; but, before they could execute their de|&s;ign,

lords, who had been formerly members of his council, as

a printed declaration, importing that the King of
France had enabled him to make another effort to re|trieve
his crown; that, although he was furni&s;hed with a
number of troops &s;ufficient to untie the hands of his &s;ub|jects,
he did not intend to deprive them of their &s;hare

$hould behave with the mo&s;t regular di&s;cipline, and be &s;ent
$ack immediately after his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment. He ob&s;erved
$hat when &s;uch a number of his &s;ubjects were &s;o infatuated
$s to concur with the unnatural de&s;ign of the Prince of
Orange, he had cho&s;en to rely upon the fidelity of his
Engli&s;h army, and refu&s;ed con&s;iderable &s;uccours that were
$ffered to him by his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty; that when

$yes with re&s;pect to the vain pretences of his adver&s;ary,
who&s;e aim was not the reformation but the &s;ubver&s;ion of

$is army, betrayed by his mini&s;ters, abandoned by his fa|$ourites,
and even his own children, and at la&s;t rudely
$riven from his own palace by a guard of in&s;olent foreign|$rs,
he had, for his per&s;onal &s;afety, taken refuge in France:
$hat his retreat from the malice and cruel de&s;igns of the

that by this time the nation had fairly examined the ac|count,
and, from the lo&s;&s;es and enormous expen&s;e of the
three la&s;t years, were convinced that the remedy was
wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e: that the beginning, like the fir&s;t
years of Nero's reign, would, in all probability, be found
the milde&s;t part of the u&s;urpation, and the in&s;truments
of the new e&s;tabli&s;hment live to &s;uffer &s;everely by the ty|ranny

&s;hould continue during his life, an indi&s;putable title would
&s;urvive in his i&s;&s;ue, and expo&s;e the kingdom to all the mi|&s;eries
of a civil war. He not only &s;olicited, but command|ed
his good &s;ubjects to join him, according to their duty
and the oaths they had taken. He forbade them to pay
taxes or any part of the revenue to the u&s;urper. He pro|mi&s;ed

&s;oldiers who &s;hould quit the &s;ervice of the u&s;urper, and
inli&s;t under his banners, might depend upon receiving their
pardon and arrears; and that the foreign troops, upon
laying down their arms, &s;hould be paid and tran&s;ported
to their re&s;pective countries. He &s;olemnly prote&s;ted that
he would protect and maintain the church of England,
as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed, in all her rights, privileges, and
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: he &s;ignified his re&s;olution to u&s;e his influence
with the parliament for allowing liberty of con&s;cience to
all his &s;ubjects, as an indulgence agreeable to the &s;pirit of
<PB N="143" REF="147">
the chri&s;tian religion and conducive to the wealth and
pro&s;perity of the nation. He &s;aid his principal care &s;hould
be to heal the wounds of the late di&s;tractions; to re&s;tore
trade, by ob&s;erving the act of navigation, which had been
lately &s;o much violated in favour of &s;trangers; to put the
$avy in a flouri&s;hing condition: and to take every &s;tep
that might contribute to the greatne&s;s of the monarchy
and the happine&s;s of the people. He concluded with pro|fe&s;&s;ions
of re&s;ignation to the divine will, declaring, that
all who &s;hould reject his offers of mercy, and appear in
arms again&s;t him, would be an&s;werable to Almighty God,
for all the blood that &s;hould be &s;pilt, and all the mi&s;eries
in which the&s;e kingdoms might be involved by their de&s;|perate
and unrea&s;onable oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. While this declaration operated variou&s;ly on
the minds of the people, Colonel Parker, with &s;ome other
officers, inli&s;ted men privately for the &s;ervice of James, in
the counties of York, Lanca&s;ter, and in the bi&s;hoprick of
Durham: at the &s;ame time, Fountaine and Holman were
employed in rai&s;ing two regiments of hor&s;e at London,
that they might join their ma&s;ter immediately after his
landing. His parti&s;ans &s;ent Captain Lloyd with an ex|pre&s;s
to Lord Melfort, containing a detail of the&s;e parti|culars,
with an a&s;&s;urance that they had brought over
Rear-Admiral Carter to the intere&s;t of his Maje&s;ty. They
likewi&s;e tran&s;mitted a li&s;t of the &s;hips that compo&s;ed the
Engli&s;h fleet, and exhorted James to u&s;e his influence
with the French King, that the Count de Tourville might
be ordered to attack them before they &s;hould be joined
by the Dutch &s;quadron. It was in con&s;equence of this advice,
that Louis commanded Tourville to fall upon the Engli&s;h
fleet, even without waiting for the Toulon &s;quadron,
commanded by the Marquis D'Etrees. By this time James
had repaired to La Hogue, and was ready to embark with
his army, con&s;i&s;ting of a body of French troops, together
with &s;ome Engli&s;h and Scotch refugees, and the regi|ments
which had been tran&s;ported from Ireland by vir|tue
of the capitulation of Limerick.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. The mini&s;try of England was informed of all
<PB N="144" REF="148">
the&s;e particulars, partly by &s;ome agents of James, who
betrayed his cau&s;e, and partly by Admiral Carter, who
gave the Queen to under&s;tand he had been tampered with:
and was in&s;tructed to amu&s;e the Jacobites with a negocia|tion.
King William no &s;ooner arrived in Holland, than
he ha&s;tened the naval preparations of the Dutch, &s;o that
their fleet was ready for &s;ea &s;ooner than was expected;
and when he received the fir&s;t intimation of the projected
de&s;cent, he detached General Ptolemache with three of
the Engli&s;h regiments from Holland. The&s;e, re-enforced
with other troops remaining in England, were ordered to
encamp in the neighbourhood of Port&s;mouth. The Queen
i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, commanding all papi&s;ts to depart
from London and We&s;tmin&s;ter: the members of both
Hou&s;es of parliament were required to meet on the twenty-fourth
of May, that &s;he might avail her&s;elf of their ad|vice
in &s;uch a perilous conjuncture. Warrants were ex|pedited
for apprehending divers di&s;affected per&s;ons; and
they withdrawing them&s;elves from their re&s;pective places
of abode, a proclamation was publi&s;hed for di&s;covering
and bringing them to ju&s;tice. The Earls of Scar&s;dale,
Lichfield, and Newburgh; the Lords Griffin, Forbes,
Sir John Fenwick, Sir Theoph. Oglethorpe, and others,
found means to elude the &s;earch. The Earls of Hunting|don
and Marlborough were &s;ent to the Tower: Edward
Ridley, Knevitt, Ha&s;tings, and Robert Fergu&s;on, were
impri&s;oned in Newgate. The Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter was
confined to his own hou&s;e: the Lords Brudenell and
Fan&s;haw were &s;ecured: the Earls of Dunmore, Middle|ton,
and Sir Andrew Forre&s;ter were di&s;covered in a qua|ker's
hou&s;e, and committed to pri&s;on, with &s;everal other
per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. The train-bands of London and
We&s;tmin&s;ter were armed by the Queen's direction, and
&s;he reviewed them in per&s;on: Adm. Ru&s;&s;el was ordered
to put to &s;ea with all po&s;&s;ible expedition; and Carter, with
a &s;quadron of eighteen &s;ail, continued to crui&s;e along th$
French coa&s;t, to ob&s;erve the motions of the enemy.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. On the eleventh day of May, Ru&s;&s;el &s;aile$
from Rye to St. Helen's, where he was joined by th$
<PB N="145" REF="149">
&s;quadrons under Delaval and Carter. There he received
a letter from the Earl of Nottingham, intimating, that a
report having &s;pread of the Queen's &s;u&s;pecting the fidelity
of the &s;ea-officers, her Maje&s;ty had ordered him to decare
in her name, that &s;he repo&s;ed the mo&s;t entire confidence
in their attachment; and believed the report was rai&s;ed
by the enemies of the government. The flag-officers
and captains forthwith drew up a very loyal and dutiful
addre&s;s, which was graciou&s;ly received by the Queen, and
publi&s;hed for the &s;atisfaction of the nation. Ru&s;&s;el, being
re-enforced by the Dutch &s;quadrons, commanded by
Allemonde, Callembergh, and Vandergoes, &s;et &s;ail for the
coa&s;t of France on the eighteenth day of May, with a
fleet of ninety-nine &s;hips of the line, be&s;ides frigates and
fire-&s;hips. Next day, about three o'clock in the morn|ing,
he di&s;covered the enemy, under the Count de Tour|ville,
and threw out the &s;ignal for the line of battle, which
by eight o'clock was formed in good order, the Dutch in
the van, the blue divi&s;ion in the rear, and the red in the
centre. The French fleet did not exceed &s;ixty-three &s;hips
of the line, and, as they were to windward, Tourville
might have avoided an engagement: but, he had received
a po&s;itive order to fight, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the Dutch
and Engli&s;h &s;quadrons had not joined. Louis, indeed,
was appri&s;ed of their junction before they were de&s;cried by
his admiral, to whom he di&s;patched a countermanding
order by two &s;everal ve&s;&s;els: but, one of them was taken
by the Engli&s;h, and the other did not arrive till the day
after the engagement.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. Tourville, therefore, in obedience to the
fir&s;t mandate, bore down along &s;ide of Ru&s;&s;el's own &s;hip,
which he engaged at a very &s;mall di&s;tance. He fought
with great fury till one o'clock, when his rigging and &s;ails
being con&s;iderably damaged, his &s;hip, the Ri&s;ing-Sun,
which carried one hundred and four cannon, was towed
out of the line in great di&s;order. Neverthele&s;s, the en|gagement
continued till three, when the fleets were parted
by a thick fog. When this abated, the enemy were
<PB N="146" REF="150">
de&s;cried flying to the northward; and Ru&s;&s;el made the
&s;ignal for cha&s;ing. Part of the blue &s;quadron came up
with the enemy about eight in the evening, and engaged
them half an hour, during which Admiral Carter was
mortally wounded. Finding him&s;elf in extremity, he
exhorted his captain to fight as long as the &s;hip could
&s;wim; and expired with great compo&s;ure. At length,
the French bore away for Conquet-Road, having lo&s;t four
&s;hips in this day's action. Next day, about eight in the
morning, they were di&s;covered crowding away to the we&s;t|ward,
and the combined fleets cha&s;ed with all the &s;ail
they could carry, until Ru&s;&s;el's foretop-ma&s;t came by the
board. Though he was retarded by this accident, the
fleet &s;till continued the pur&s;uit, and anchored near Cape
La Hogue. On the twenty-&s;econd of the month, about
&s;even in the morning, part of the French fleet was per|ceived
near the Race of Alderney, &s;ome at anchor, and
&s;ome driving to the ea&s;tward with the tide of flood. Ru&s;|&s;el,
and the &s;hips neare&s;t him, immediately &s;lipped their
cables and cha&s;ed. The Royal-Sun, having lo&s;t her
ma&s;ts, ran a&s;hore near Cherbourg, where &s;he was burned
by Sir Ralph Delaval, together with the Admirable,
another fir&s;t-rate, and the Conquerant of eighty guns.
Eighteen other &s;hips of their fleet ran into La Hogue,
where they were attacked by Sir George Rooke, who de|&s;troyed
them, and a great number of tran&s;ports laden
with ammunition, in the mid&s;t of a terrible fire from the
enemy, and in fight of the Iri&s;h camp. Sir John A&s;hby,
with his own &s;quadron and &s;ome Dutch &s;hips, pur&s;ued
the re&s;t of the French fleet, which e&s;caped through the
Race of Alderney, by &s;uch a dangerous pa&s;&s;age as the
Engli&s;h could not attempt, without expo&s;ing their &s;hips to
the mo&s;t imminent hazard. This was a very mortifying
defeat to the French King, who had been &s;o long
flattered with an uninterrupted &s;eries of victories: it re|duced
James to the lowe&s;t ebb of de&s;pondence, as it
fru&s;trated the whole &s;cheme of his embarkation, and over|whelmed
his friends in England with grief and de&s;pair.
<PB N="147" REF="151">
Some hi&s;torians alledge, that Ru&s;&s;el did not improve his
victory with all advantages that might have been obtained,
before the enemy recovered of their con&s;ternation. They
&s;ay, his affection to the &s;ervice was in a good mea&s;ure
cooled by the di&s;grace of his friend, the Earl of Marlbo|rough:
that he hated the Earl of Nottingham, by who&s;e
canal he received his orders; and, that he adhered to the
letter, rather than to the &s;pirit of his in&s;tructions. But
this is a malicious imputation; and a very ungrateful re|turn
for his manifold &s;ervices to the nation. He acted in
this whole expedition with the genuine &s;pirit of a Briti&s;h
admiral. He plyed from the Nore to the Downs with a
very &s;canty wind, through the dangerous &s;ands, contrary
to the advice of all his pilots; and by this bold pa&s;&s;age
effected a junction of the different &s;quadrons, which other|wi&s;e
the French would have attacked &s;ingly and perhaps
defeated. He behaved with great gallantry during the
engagement; and de&s;troyed about fifteen of the enemy's
capital &s;hips: in a word, he obtained &s;uch a deci&s;ive
victory, that during the remaining part of the war, the
French would not hazard another battle by &s;ea with the
Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. Ru&s;&s;el having ordered Sir John A&s;hby
and the Dutch Admiral Callembergh, to &s;teer towards
Havre de Grace, and endeavour to de&s;troy the remainder
of the French fleet, &s;ailed back to St. Helen's, that the
damaged &s;hips might be re&s;itted, and the fleet furni&s;hed
with fre&s;h &s;upplies of provi&s;ion and ammunition: but his
principal motive was, to take on board a number of troops
provided for a de&s;cent upon France, which had been projected
by England and Holland, with a view to alarm and di&s;tract
the enemy in their own dominions. The Queen was &s;o
plea&s;ed with the victory, that &s;he ordered thirty thou&s;and
pounds to be di&s;tributed among the &s;ailors. She cau&s;ed
medals to be &s;truck in honour of the action; and the
bodies of Admiral Carter and Captain Ha&s;tings, who had
been killed in the battle, to be interred with great funeral
pomp. In the latter end of July, &s;even thou&s;and men,
<PB N="148" REF="152">
commanded by the Duke of Lein&s;ter, embarked on board
tran&s;ports, to be landed at St. Maloes, Bre&s;t, or Roche|fort;
and the nation conceived the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes
of this expedition. A council of war, con&s;i&s;ting of land
and &s;ea-officers, being held on board the Breda, to delibe|rate
upon the &s;cheme of the mini&s;try, the members unani|mou&s;ly
agreed, that the &s;ea&s;on was too far advanced to put
it in execution. Neverthele&s;s, the Admiral having detached
Sir John A&s;hby with a &s;quadron, to intercept the remains
of the French fleet, in their pa&s;&s;age from St. Maloes to
Bre&s;t, &s;et &s;ail for La Hogue with the re&s;t of the fleet and
tran&s;ports: but, in a few days, the wind &s;hifting, he was
obliged to return to St. Helen's.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. The Queen immediately di&s;patched the Mar|quis
of Caermarthen, the Earls of Devon&s;hire, Dor&s;et,
Nottingham, and Roche&s;ter, together with the Lords
Sidney and Cornwallis, to con&s;ult with the Admiral, who
demon&s;trated the impracticability of making an effectual
de&s;cent upon the coa&s;t of France at that &s;ea&s;on of the year.
The de&s;ign was, therefore, laid a&s;ide; and the forces were
tran&s;ported to Flanders. The higher the hopes of the
nation had been rai&s;ed by this armament, the deeper they
felt their di&s;appointment. A loud clamour was rai&s;ed
again&s;t the mini&s;try, as the authors of this mi&s;carriage.
The people complained, that they were plundered and
abu&s;ed: that immen&s;e &s;ums were extorted from them by
the mo&s;t grievous impo&s;itions: that by the infamous ex|pedient
of borrowing upon e&s;tabli&s;hed funds, their taxes
were perpetuated: that their burthens would daily in|crea&s;e:
that their trea&s;ure was either &s;quandered away in
chimerical projects, or expended in foreign connexions,
of which England was naturally independent. They were
the more excu&s;able for exclaming in this manner, as their
trade had &s;uff$red grievou&s;ly by the French privateers,
which &s;warmed in the channel. In vain the merchants
had recour&s;e to the Admiralty, which could not &s;pare par|ticular
convoys, while large fleets were required for the
defence of the nation. The French King, having nothing
<PB N="149" REF="153">
further to apprehend from the Engli&s;h armament, with|drew
his troops from the coa&s;t of Normandy; and James
returned in de&s;pair to St. Germain's, where his Queen
had been in his ab&s;ence delivered of a daughter, who was
born in pre&s;ence of the Archbi&s;hop of Paris, the
Keeper of the Seals, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. Louis had taken the field in the latter end of
May. On the twentieth day of that month he arrived at
his camp in Flanders, with all the effeminate pomp of an
A&s;iatick emperor, attended by his women and para&s;ites,
his band of mu&s;ick, his dancers, his opera, and, in a word,
by all the mini&s;ters of luxury and &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure. Hav|ing
reviewed his army, which amounted to about one
hundred and twenty thou&s;and men, he undertook the &s;iege
of Namur, which he inve&s;ted on both &s;ides of the Sambre,
with about one half of his army, while the other covered
the &s;iege, under the command of Luxembourg. Namur
is &s;ituated on the conflux of the Meu&s;e and the Sambre.
The citadel was deemed one of the &s;tronge&s;t &s;orts in
Flanders, &s;trengthened with a new work contrived by the
famous engineer Coehorn, who now defended it in per&s;on.
The Prince de Barba&s;on commanded the garri&s;on, con|&s;i&s;ting
of nine thou&s;and men. The place was well &s;up|plied;
and the governor knew that King William would
make &s;trong efforts for its relief: &s;o that the be&s;ieged
were animated with many concurring con&s;iderations.
Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e advantages, the a&s;&s;ailants carried on
their attacks with &s;uch vigour, that in &s;even days after
the trenches were opened the town capitulated, and the
garri&s;on retired into the citadel. King William, being
joined by the troops of Brandenburgh and Liege, advanced
to the Mehaigne, at the head of one hundred thou&s;and ef|fective
men, and encamped within cannon-&s;hot of Lux|embourg's
army, which lay on the other &s;ide of the river.
That general, however, had taken &s;uch precautions, that
the King of England could not interrupt the &s;iege, nor
attack the French lines without great di&s;advantage. The
be&s;iegers, encouraged by the pre&s;ence of their monarch,
<PB N="150" REF="154">
and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the &s;uperior abilities of Vauban their engi|neer,
repeated their attacks with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that
the fort of Coehorn was &s;urrendered, after a very ob&s;tinate
defence, in which he him&s;elf had been dangerou&s;ly
wounded. The citadel being thus left expo&s;ed to the
approaches of the enemy, could not long with&s;tand the
violence of their operations. The two covered-ways were
taken by a&s;&s;ault: on the twentieth of May the governor
capitulated, to the un&s;peakable mortification of King Wil|liam,
who &s;aw him&s;elf obliged to lie inactive at the head
of a powerful army, and be an eye witne&s;s of the lo&s;s of
the mo&s;t important fortre&s;s in the Netherlands. Louis,
having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, returned in triumph
to Ver&s;ailles, where he was flattered with all the arts of
adulation; while William's reputation &s;uffered a little
from his mi&s;carriage, and the Prince of Barba&s;on incurred
the &s;u&s;picion of treachery or mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. Luxembourg having placed a &s;trong garri&s;on
in Namur, detached Boufflers with a body of troops to
La Bu&s;&s;iere, and with the re&s;t of his army encamped at
Soignies. The King of England &s;ent off detachments
towards Liege and Ghent; and on the &s;ixth day of July
po&s;ted him&s;elf at Genap, re&s;olved to &s;eize the fir&s;t oppor|tunity
of retrieving his honour, by attacking the enemy.
Having received intelligence that the French general was
in motion, and intended to take po&s;t between Steenkerke
and Enghien, he pa&s;&s;ed the river Senne, in order to antici|pate
his purpo&s;e: but, in &s;pite of all his diligence, Lux|embourg
gained his point; and William encamped at
Lembecq, within &s;ix miles of the French army. Here he
re&s;olved, in a council of war, to attack the enemy; and
every di&s;po&s;ition was made for that purpo&s;e. The heavy
baggage he ordered to be conveyed to the other &s;ide of the
Senne; and one Millevoix, a detected &s;py, was compelled
by menaces to mi&s;lead Luxembourg with fal&s;e intelligence,
importing, that he need not be alarmed at the motions of
the allies, who intended next day to make a general forage.
On the twenty-fourth day of July, the army began to
<PB N="151" REF="155">
move from the left, in two columns, as the ground would
not admit of their marching in an extended front. The
Prince of Wirtemberg began the attack on the right of
the enemy, at the head of ten battalions of Engli&s;h, Da|ni&s;h,
and Dutch infantry: he was &s;upported by a con|&s;iderable
body of Briti&s;h hor&s;e and foot, commanded by
Lieutenant-General Mackay. Though the ground was
inter&s;ected by hedges, ditches, and narrow defiles, the
Prince marched with &s;uch diligence, that he was in a
condition to begin the battle about two in the after|noon,
when he charged the French with &s;uch impetu|o&s;ity,
that they were driven from their po&s;ts, and their
whole camp became a &s;cene of tumult and confu&s;ion.
Luxembourg, tru&s;ting to the intelligence he had received,
allowed him&s;elf to be &s;urpri&s;ed; and it required the full
exertion of his &s;uperior talents, to remedy the con&s;equences
of his neglect. He forthwith forgot a &s;evere indi&s;po&s;ition
under which he then laboured; he rallied his broken
battalions: he drew up his forces in order of battle, and
led them to the charge in per&s;on. The Duke de Chartres,
who was then in the fifteenth year of his age, the Dukes
of Bourbon and Vendome, the Prince of Conti, and a
great number of volunteers of the fir&s;t quality, put them|&s;elves
at the head of the hou&s;ehold troops, and fell with
great fury upon the Engli&s;h, who were very ill &s;upported
by Count Solmes, the officer who commanded the centre
of the allies. The Prince of Wirtemberg had taken one
of the enemy's batteries, and actually penetrated into their
lines: but finding him&s;elf in danger of being overpowered
by numbers, he &s;ent an aide-du-camp twice, to demand
&s;uccours from Solmes, who derided his di&s;tre&s;s, &s;aying,
&startq;Let us &s;ee what &s;port the&s;e Engli&s;h bull-dogs will
make.&endq; At length, when the King &s;ent an expre&s;s
order, commanding him to &s;u&s;tain the left wing, he made
a motion with his hor&s;e, which could not act while his
infantry kept their ground; and the Briti&s;h troops, with
a few Dutch and Danes, bore the whole brunt of the en|gagement.
They fought with &s;urpri&s;ing courage and
<PB N="152" REF="156">
per&s;everance again&s;t dreadful odds; and the event of the
battle continued doubtful, until Boufflers joined the
French army with a great body of dragoons. The allies
could not &s;u&s;tain the additional weight of this re-enforce|ment,
before which they gave way, though the retreat
was made in tolerable order; and the enemy did not
think proper to pro&s;ecute the advantage they had gained.
In this action the confederates lo&s;t the Earl of Angus,
General Mackay, Sir John Lanier, Sir Robert Douglas,
and many other gallant officers, together with about three
thou&s;and men left dead on the &s;pot, the &s;ame number
wounded or taken, a great many colours and &s;tandards,
and &s;everal pieces of cannon.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. The French, however, reaped no &s;olid ad|vantage
from this victory, which co&s;t them about three
thou&s;and men, including the Prince of Turenne, the
Marquis de Bellefonds, Tilladet, and Ferma&ccedil;on, with
many officers of di&s;tinction: as for Millevoix the &s;py, he
was hanged on a tree, on the right wing of the allied
army. King William retired unmole&s;ted to his own
camp; and, notwith&s;tanding all his overthrows, continued
a re&s;pectable enemy, by dint of invincible fortitude, and
a genius fruitful in re&s;ources. That he was formidable to
the French nation, even in the mid&s;t of his ill &s;ucce&s;s,
appears from divers undeniable te&s;timonies, and from none
more than from the extravagance of joy expre&s;&s;ed by the
people of France, on occa&s;ion of this unimportant victory.
When the princes who &s;erved in the battle returned to
Paris, the roads through which they pa&s;&s;ed were almo&s;t
blocked up with multitudes; and the whole air re&s;ounded
with acclamation. All the ornaments of the fa&s;hion pe|culiar
to both &s;exes adopted the name of Steenkerke:
every individual who had been per&s;onally engaged in the
action was revered as a being of a superior &s;pecies; and the
tran&s;ports of the women ro&s;e almo&s;t to a degree of frenzy.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. The French mini&s;try did not entirely de|pend
upon the fortune of the war for the execution of
their revenge again&s;t King William. They likewi&s;e em|ployed
<PB N="153" REF="157">
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins to deprive him of life, in the mo&s;t trea|cherous
manner. When Louvois died, his &s;on, the Marquis
de Barbe&s;ieux, who &s;ucceeded him in his office of &s;ecre|tary,
found, among his papers, the draft of a &s;cheme for
this purpo&s;e, and immediately revived the de&s;ign, by means
of the Chevalier de Grandval, a captain of dragoons in
the &s;ervice. He and Colonel Parker engaged one Du|mont,
who undertook to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate King William. Ma|dame
de Maintenon, and Paparel, payma&s;ter to the French
$rmy, were privy to the &s;cheme, which they encouraged:
the con&s;pirators are &s;aid to have obtained an audience of
King James, who approved of their undertaking, and a&s;|&s;ured
them of his protection; but that unfortunate mo|narch
was unju&s;tly charged with the guilt of countenan|$ing
the intended murder, as they communicated nothing
to him but an attempt to &s;eize the per&s;on of the Prince of
Orange. Dumont actually enli&s;ted in the confederate ar|my,
that he might have the better opportunity to &s;hoot
the King of England when he &s;hould ride out to vi&s;it the
$ines, while Grandval and Parker repaired to the French
$amp, with orders to Luxembourg, to furni&s;h them with
$word$ party of hor&s;e for the re&s;cue of Dumont, after the blow
&s;hould be &s;truck. Whether this man's heart failed him,
$or he could not find the opportunity he de&s;ired, after ha|ving
re&s;ided &s;ome weeks in the camp of the allies, he re|$ired
to Hanover; but &s;till corre&s;ponded with Grandval
$nd Barbe&s;ieux. This la&s;t admitted one Leefdale, a Dutch
$aron, into the &s;ecret, and likewi&s;e imparted it to Mon|$$ur
Chanlais, quarter ma&s;ter-general of the French army,
who animated Grandval and Leefdale with the promi&s;e of
$word$ con&s;iderable reward, and promi&s;ed to co-operate with
Parker for bringing off Dumont, for this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in &s;till per|$i&s;ted
in his undertaking. Leefdale had been &s;ent from
Holland, on purpo&s;e to dive to the bottom of this con|&s;piracy,
in con&s;equence of advice given by the Briti&s;h en|$oy
at Hanover, where Dumont had dropped &s;ome hints
that alarmed his &s;u&s;picion. The Dutchman not only in|&s;inuated
him&s;elf into the con&s;idence of the con$pirators,
<PB N="154" REF="158">
but likewi&s;e inveigled Grandval to Eyndhoven, where he
was apprehended. Under&s;tanding that Dumont had al|ready
di&s;covered the de&s;ign to the Duke of Zell, and that
he him&s;elf had been betrayed by Leefdale, he freely con|fe&s;&s;ed
all the particulars, without enduring the torture;
and, being found guilty by a court-martial, was executed
as a traitor.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. About this period the Duke of Lein&s;ter arrived
at O&s;tend, with the troops which had been embarked at St.
Helen's. He was furni&s;hed with cannon &s;ent down the
Meu&s;e from Mae&s;tricht; and re-enforced by a large de|tachment
from the King's camp at Gramont, under the
command of General Ptolemache. He took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Furnes, was joined by the Earl of Portland and M. D' Au|verquerque,
and a di&s;po&s;ition was made for inve&s;ting
Dunkirk; but, on further deliberation, the enterprize
was thought very dangerous, and therefore laid a&s;ide.
Furnes and Dixmuyde, lately reduced by Brigadier Ram|&s;ay,
were &s;trengthened with new works, and &s;ecured by
&s;trong garri&s;ons. The cannon were &s;ent back, and the
troops returning to O&s;tend, re-embarked for England.
This fruitle&s;s expedition, added to the inglorious i&s;&s;ue of
the campaign, increa&s;ed the ill humour of the Briti&s;h
nation. They taxed William with having lain inactive
at Gramont with an army of one hundred thou&s;and men,
while Luxembourg was po&s;ted at Courtray with half that
number. They &s;aid, if he had found the French lines too
&s;trong to be forced, he might have pa&s;&s;ed the Scheld
higher up, and not only laid the enemy's conque&s;ts under
contribution, but even marched into the bowels of France;
and they complained that Furnes and Dixmuyde were not
worth the &s;ums expended in maintaining their garri&s;ons.
On the twenty-&s;ixth day of September King William left
the army under the command of the Elector of Bavaria,
and repaired to his hou&s;e at Loo; in two days after his
departure the camp at Gramont was broke up; the infan|try
marched to Marienkirke, and the hor&s;e to Gaure. On
the &s;ixteenth day of October, the King receiving intelli|gence,
<PB N="155" REF="159">
that Boufflers had inve&s;ted Charleroy, and Luxem|bourg
taken po&s;t in the neighbourhood of Conde, ordered
the troops to be in&s;tanty rea&s;&s;embled between the village
of Ixells and Halle, with de&s;ign to rai&s;e the &s;iege, and
repaired to Bru&s;&s;els, where he held a council of war, in
which the proper mea&s;ures were concerted. He then re|turned
to Holland, leaving the command with the Elector
of Bavaria, who forthwith began his march to Charleroy.
At his approach Boufflers abandoned the &s;iege, and moved
towards Philipville. The Elector having re-enforced the
place, and thrown &s;upplies into Aeth, di&s;tributed his for|ces
into winter-quarters. Then Luxembourg, who had
cantoned his army between Conde, Leuze, and Tournay,
returned to Paris, leaving Boufflers to command in his
ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. The allies had been un&s;ucce&s;sful in Flanders,
and they were not fortunate in Germany. The Land|grave
of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el undertook the &s;iege of Eberemburgh,
which, however, he was obliged to abandon. The Duke
de Lorges, who commanded the French forces on the
Rhine, &s;urpri&s;ed, defeated, and took the Duke of Wir|temberg,
who had po&s;ted him&s;elf with four thou&s;and hor&s;e
near Eidel&s;heim, to check the progre&s;s of the enemy.
Count Tallard having inve&s;ted Rhinefeld, the Landgrave
marched to its relief with &s;uch expedition, that the French
were obliged to de&s;i&s;t, and retreat with con&s;iderable da|mage.
The Elector of Saxony had engaged to bring an
army into the field; but, he complained that the Emperor
left the burthen of the war with France upon the princes,
and converted his chief power and attention to the cam|paign
in Hungary. A jealou&s;y and mi&s;under&s;tanding en|&s;ued:
Schoening, the Saxon general, in his way to the
hot-baths at Dablitz in Bohemia, was &s;eized by the Em|peror's
order, on &s;u&s;picion of having maintained a private
corre&s;pondence with the enemy, and very warm expo&s;tu|lations
on this &s;ubject pa&s;&s;ed between the courts of Vienna
and Dre&s;den. Schoening was detained two years in
cu&s;tody; and at length relea&s;ed, on condition that he
<PB N="156" REF="160">
&s;hould never be employed again in the empire. The wa$
in Hungary produced no event of importance. The mi|ni&s;try
of the Ottoman Porte was di&s;tracted by factions, and
the &s;eraglio threatened with tumults. The people were
tired of maintaining an un&s;ucce&s;sful war: the Vi&s;ir wa$
depo&s;ed; and, in the mid&s;t of this confu&s;ion, the garri|&s;on
of great Waradin, which had been blocked up by the
Imperiali&s;ts during the whole winter, &s;urrendered on capitu|lation.
Lord Paget, the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador at Vienna, was
&s;ent to Con&s;tantinople, with powers to mediate a peace
but the terms offered by the Emperor were rejected a$
the Porte: the Turki&s;h army lay upon the defen&s;ive&punc;
and the &s;ea&s;on was &s;pent in a fruitle&s;s negociation.</P>
<P>XXXVI. The pro&s;pect of affairs in Piedmont was fa|vourable
for the allies; but the court of France had
brought the Pope to an accommodation, and began to
tamper with the Duke of Savoy. M. Chanlais was &s;ent
to Turin, with advantageous propo&s;als, which, however,
the Duke would not accept, becau&s;e he thought him&s;elf
entitled to better terms, con&s;idering that the allied army
in Piedmont amounted to fifty thou&s;and effective men,
while Catinat's forces were not &s;ufficient to defend his
conque&s;ts in that country. In the month of July the
Duke marched into Dauphine, where he plundered a
number of villages, and reduced the fortre&s;s of Guille&s;tre;
then pa&s;&s;ing the river Darance, he inve&s;ted Ambrun,
which, after a &s;iege of nine days, &s;urrendered on capitu|lation:
He afterwards laid all the neighbouring towns un|der
contribution. Here Duke Schomberg, who com|manded
the auxiliaries in the Engli&s;h pay, publi&s;hed a de|claration,
in the name of King William, inviting the peo|ple
to join his &s;tandard, a&s;&s;uring them that his ma&s;ter had
no other de&s;ign in ordering his troops to invade France,
but that of re&s;toring the noble&s;&s;e to their ancient &s;plen|dour,
their parliaments to their former authority, and the
people to their ju&s;t privileges. He even offered his pro|tection
to the clergy, and promi&s;ed to u&s;e his endeavours
for reviving the edict of Nantes, which had been guaranteed
<PB N="157" REF="161">
by the Kings of England. The&s;e offers, however, pro|duced
little effect; and the Germans ravaged the whole
country, in revenge for the cruelties which the French
had committed in the Palatinate. The allied army ad|vanced
from Ambrun to Gap, on the frontiers of Pro|vence,
and this place &s;ubmitted without oppo&s;ition. The
inhabitants of Grenoble, the capital of Dauphine, and
even of Lyons, were overwhelmed with con&s;ternation;
and a fairer opportunity of humbling France could never
occur, as that part of the kingdom had been left almo&s;t
quite defencele&s;s: but this was fatally neglected, either
from the &s;pirit of di&s;&s;ention which began to prevail in the
allied army, or from the indi&s;po&s;ition of the Duke of
Savoy, who was &s;ei&s;ed with the &s;mall-pox in the mid&s;t of
this expedition; or, la&s;tly, to his want of &s;incerity, which
was &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected. He is &s;aid to have maintained a
con&s;tant corre&s;pondence with the court of Ver&s;ailles, in
complai&s;ance to which he retarded the operations of the
confederates. Certain it is, he evacuated all his conque&s;ts,
and about the middle of September quitted the French ter|ritories,
after having pillaged and laid wa&s;te the country
through which he had penetrated<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">At this period Queen Mary, under&s;tanding that the prote&s;tant Vaudo$$ $ere de&s;titute of mini&s;ters to preach or teach the go&s;pel, e&s;tabli&s;hed a fund from $er own privy pur&s;e, to maintain ten preachers, and as many &s;choolma&s;ters, $word$ the vallies of Piedmont.</NOTE>. In Catalonia the
French attempted nothing of importance during this
campaign, and the Spaniards were wholly inactive in that
province.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. The prote&s;tant intere&s;t in Germany ac|quired
an acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength, by the creation of a ninth
electorate in favour of Erne&s;t Augu&s;tus, Duke of Hanover.
He had, by this time, renounced all his connexions with
France, and engaged to enter heartily into the intere&s;t of
$he allies, in con&s;ideration of his obtaining the electoral
dignity. King William exerted him&s;elf &s;o vigorou&s;ly in
$is behalf at the court of Vienna, that the Emperor agreed
$o the propo&s;al, in ca&s;e the con&s;ent of the other electors
<PB N="158" REF="162">
could be procured. This a&s;&s;ent, however, was extorted
by the importunities of the King of England, whom he
dur&s;t not di&s;oblige. Leopold was blindly bigotted to the
religion of Rome, and con&s;equently aver&s;e to a new crea|tion,
that would weaken the catholick intere&s;t in th$
electoral college. He, therefore, employed his emi&s;&s;arie
to thwart the Duke's mea&s;ures. Some prote&s;tant prince
oppo&s;ed him from motives of jealou&s;y, and the French
King u&s;ed all his artifices and influence, to prevent th$
elevation of the Hou&s;e of Hanover. When the Duke ha$
&s;urmounted all his oppo&s;ition, &s;o far as to gain over
majority of the electors, new objections were &s;tarted. Th$
Emperor &s;ugge&s;ted that another popi&s;h electorate &s;hould b$
created, to balance the advantage which the Lutheran
would reap from that of Hanover; and he propo&s;ed th$
Au&s;tria &s;hould be rai&s;ed to the &s;ame dignity: but viole$$
oppo&s;ition was made to this expedient, which would hav$
ve&s;ted the Emperor with a double vote in the elector
college. At length, after a tedious negociation, $word$
Duke of Hanover, on the nineteenth day of December
was honoured with the inve&s;titure, as Elector of Brun$wick;
created great mar&s;hal of the empire, and did $word$
to the Emperor: neverthele&s;s, he was not yet a$$mitted
into the college, becau&s;e he had not been able $word$
procure the unanimous con&s;ent of all the electors<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the beginning of September the &s;hock of an earthquake was felt London, and many other parts of England, as well as in France, Germa$ and the Netherlands. Violent agitations of the &s;ame kind had happ$ about two months before in Sicily and Malta; and the town of Po$$-R$ in Jamaica was almo&s;t totally ruined by an earthquake; the place was &s;uddenly overflowed, that about fifteen hundred per&s;ons peri&s;hed.</NOTE>.</P>

&sect;I WHILE King William &s;eemed wholly engro&s;&s;ed
by the affairs of the continent, England was
di&s;tracted by dome&s;tick di&s;&s;ention, and over&s;pread with
vice, corruption, and profanity. Over and above the
Jacobites, there was a &s;et of malcontents, who&s;e number
daily increa&s;ed. They not only murmured at the griev|ances
of the nation, but compo&s;ed and publi&s;hed elabo|rate
di&s;&s;ertations upon the &s;ame &s;ubject. The&s;e made &s;uch
impre&s;&s;ions upon the people, already irritated by heavy
<PB N="161" REF="165">
burthens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV. 1692.</NOTE> di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in their trade, and di&s;appointed in
their &s;anguine expectations, that the Queen thought it
nece&s;&s;ary to check the progre&s;s of tho&s;e writers, by i&s;&s;uing
out a proclamation, offering a reward to &s;uch as would
di&s;cover &s;editious libellers. The Earl of Marlborough
had been committed to the Tower, on the information of
one Robert Young, a pri&s;oner in Newgate, who had
forged that nobleman's hand-writing, and contrived the
&s;cheme of an a&s;&s;ociation in favour of King James, to
which he affixed the names of the Earls of Marlborough
and Sali&s;bury, Sprat, Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, the Lord
Cornbury, and Sir Ba&s;il Firebrace. One of his emi&s;&s;a|ries
had found means to conceal this paper in a certain
part of the Bi&s;hop's hou&s;e at Bromley in Kent, where it
was found by the King's me&s;&s;engers, who &s;ecured the
prelate in con&s;equence of Young's information. But he
vindicated him&s;elf to the &s;atisfaction of the whole council,
and the forgery of the informer was detected by the con|fe&s;&s;ion
of his accomplice. The Bi&s;hop obtained his re|lea&s;e
immediately, and the Earl of Marlborough was ad|mitted
to bail in the court of King's-Bench.</P>
<P>&sect; II. So many per&s;ons of character and di&s;tinction had
been impri&s;oned during this reign, upon the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;|picion,
that the di&s;contented part of the nation had &s;ome
rea&s;on to in&s;inuate, they had only exchanged one tyrant
for another. They affirmed, that the Habeas Corpus act
was either in&s;ufficient to protect the &s;ubject from fal&s;e
impri&s;onment, or had been &s;hamefully mi&s;u&s;ed. They
expatiated upon the lo&s;s of &s;hips, which had lately fallen
a prey to the enemy; the con&s;umption of &s;eamen; the
neglect of the fi&s;heries; the interruption of commerce, in
which the nation was &s;upplanted by her allies, as well as
invaded by her enemies; the low ebb of the kingdom's
trea&s;ure exhau&s;ted in hiring foreign bottoms, and paying
foreign troops to $ight foreign quarrels; and the &s;laughter
of the be&s;t and brave&s;t of their countrymen, who&s;e blood
had been lavi&s;hly &s;pilt in &s;upport of connexions with which
they ought to have had no concern. They demon&s;trated
<PB N="162" REF="166">
the mi&s;chiefs that nece&s;&s;arily aro&s;e from the un&s;ettled &s;tate
of the nation. They ob&s;erved that the government could
not be duely e&s;tabli&s;hed, until a &s;olemn declaration &s;hould
confirm the legality of that tenure by which their Maje&s;ties
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the throne; that the &s;tructure of parliaments was
deficient in point of &s;olidity, as they exi&s;ted entirely at the
plea&s;ure of the crown, which would u&s;e them no longer
than they &s;hould be found nece&s;&s;ary in rai&s;ing &s;upplies for
the u&s;e of the government. They exclaimed again&s;t the
practice of quartering &s;oldiers in private hou&s;es, contrary
to the ancient laws of the land, the petition of rights, and
the &s;ub&s;equent act on that &s;ubject pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of
the &s;econd Charles. They enumerated among their
grievances the violation of property, by pre&s;&s;ing tran&s;port
&s;hips into the &s;ervice, without &s;ettling any fund of pay|ment
for the owners; the condition of the militia, which
was equally burthen&s;ome and u&s;ele&s;s; the flagrant partia|lity
in favour of allies, who carried on an open commerce
with France, and &s;upplied the enemy with nece&s;&s;aries,
while the Engli&s;h laboured under the &s;evere&s;t prohibitions
and were in effect the dupes of tho&s;e very powers whom
they protected. They dwelt upon the mini&s;try's want of
conduct, fore&s;ight, and intelligence, and inveighed again&s;t
their ignorance, in&s;olence, and neglect, which were as
pernicious to the nation as if they had formed a de&s;ign of
reducing it to the lowe&s;t ebb of di&s;grace and de&s;truction.
By this time, indeed, publick virtue was become the
object of ridicule, and the whole kingdom was over&s;pread
with immorality and corruption; towards the increa&s;e of
which many concurring circum&s;tances happened to con|tribute.
The people were divided into three parties,
namely, the Williamites, the Jacobites, and the di&s;con|tented
Revolutioners: the&s;e $actions took all opportu|nities
to thwart, to expo&s;e, and to ridicule the mea&s;ures
and principles of each other; &s;o that patrioti&s;m was laughed
out of doors, as an hypocritical pretence. This conten|tion
e&s;tabli&s;hed a belief, that every man con&s;ulted his own
private intere&s;t at the expen&s;e of the publick: a belief that
<PB N="163" REF="167">
&s;oon grew into a maxim almo&s;t univer&s;ally adopted. The
practice of bribing a majority in parliament had a perni|cious
influence upon the morals of all ranks of people,
from the candidate to the lowe&s;t borough-elector. The
expedient of e&s;tabli&s;hing funds of credit for rai&s;ing &s;upplies
to defray the expen&s;es of government, threw large pre|miums
and &s;ums of money into the hands of low, &s;ordid
u&s;urers, brokers, and jobbers, who di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves
by the name of the Monied-intere&s;t. Intoxicated by
this flow of wealth, they affected to rival the luxury and
magnificence of their &s;uperiors; but, being de&s;titute of
&s;entiment and ta&s;te, to conduct them in their new career,
they ran into the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and illiberal extravagancies.
They laid a&s;ide all decorum; became lewd, in&s;olent,
intemperate, and riotous. Their example was caught by
the vulgar. All principle, and even decency, was gra|dually
bani&s;hed; talent lay uncultivated, and the land
was deluged with a tide of ignorance and profligacy.</P>
<P>&sect; III. King William having a&s;certained the winter-quarters
of the army, and concerted the operations of the
en&s;uing campaign with the States-General, and the mi|ni&s;ters
of the allies, &s;et &s;ail for England on the fifteenth
day of October; on the eighteenth landed at Yarmouth,
was met by the Queen at Newhall, and pa&s;&s;ed through
the city of London to Ken&s;ington, amid&s;t the acclama|tions
of the populace. He received a congratulatory ad|dre&s;s
from the Lord-Mayor and Aldermen, with whom he
dined in publick by invitation. A day of thank&s;giving
was appointed for the victory obtained at &s;ea. The lute|&s;tring
company was e&s;tabli&s;hed by patent, and the parlia|ment
met on the fourth day of November. The Hou&s;e of
Lords was deeply infected with di&s;content, which in &s;ome
mea&s;ure proceeded from the di&s;&s;ention between the Queen
and her &s;i&s;ter the Prince&s;s of Denmark, which la&s;t under|went
every mortification that the court could inflict. Her
guards were taken away; all honours which had been
paid to her rank by the magi&s;trates of Bath, where &s;he
&s;ometimes re&s;ided, and even by the mini&s;ters of the church
<PB N="164" REF="168">
where &s;he attended at divine &s;ervice, were di&s;continued,
by the expre&s;s order of his Maje&s;ty. Her cau&s;e was natu|rally
e&s;pou&s;ed by tho&s;e noblemen who had adhered to her
in her former conte&s;t with the King, about an inde|pendent
&s;ettlement; and the&s;e were now re-enforced by
all the friends of the Earl of Marlborough, united by a
double tie; for they re&s;ented the di&s;grace and confine|ment
of that lord, and thought it their duty to &s;upport the
Prince&s;s Anne under a per&s;ecution incurred by an attach|ment
to his counte&s;s. The Earl of Shrew&s;bury lived in
friend&s;hip with Marlborough, and thought he had been
ungratefully treated by the King: the Marquis of Hallifax
befriended him, from oppo&s;ition to the mini&s;try: the Earl
of Mulgrave, for an opportunity to di&s;play his talents, and
acquire that con&s;ideration which he thought due to his
merit. Devon&s;hire, Montague, and Bradford, joined in
the &s;ame cau&s;e from principle: the &s;ame pretence was
u&s;ed by the Earls of Stamford, Monmouth, War|rington,
and other Whigs; though in effect they were
actuated by jealou&s;y and re&s;entment again&s;t tho&s;e by whom
they had been &s;upplanted. As for the Jacobites, they
gladly contributed their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to promote any &s;cheme
that had a tendency to embroil the admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. The King, in his &s;peech to parliament, thanked
them for their la&s;t &s;upplies, congratulated them upon the
victory obtained at &s;ea, condoled them on the bad &s;ucce&s;s
of the campaign by land, magnified the power of France,
repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of maintaining a great force to
oppo&s;e it, and demanded &s;ub&s;idies equal to the occa&s;ion.
He expre&s;&s;ed his reluctance to load them with additional
burthens, which, he &s;aid, could not be avoided, without
expo&s;ing his kingdom to inevitable de&s;truction. He de&s;ired
their advice towards le&s;&s;ening the inconvenience of ex|porting
money for the payment of the forces. He inti|mated
a de&s;ign of making a de&s;cent upon France; declared
he had no aim but to make his &s;ubjects a happy people;
and that he would again chearfully expo&s;e his life for the
welfare of the nation. The Lords, after an adjournment
<PB N="165" REF="169">
of three days, began, with great warmth, to a&s;&s;ert their
privileges, which they conceived had been violated in the
ca&s;es of the Earl of Marlborough, and the other noble|men,
who had been apprehended, committed to pri&s;on,
and afterwards admitted to bail by the court of King's-Bench.
The&s;e circum&s;tances being fully di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in a
violent debate, the Hou&s;e ordered Lord Lucas, Con&s;table
of the Tower, to produce the warrants of commitment,
and the clerk of the King's-Bench to deliver the affidavit
of Aaron Smith, the court-&s;ollicitor, upon which the
lords had been remanded to pri&s;on. At the &s;ame time,
the whole affair was referred to a committee, empowered
to &s;end for per&s;ons, papers, and records. The judges
were ordered to attend: Aaron Smith was examined,
touching the evidence again&s;t the committed lords. The
committee reported their general re&s;olution, which pro|duced
a vehement di&s;pute. The opinion of the judges was
un&s;atisfactory to both parties: the debate was referred to
a committee of the whole hou&s;e, in which it was re&s;olved,
and declared, as the &s;en&s;e of that a&s;&s;embly, that in pur&s;u|ance
of the Habeas-Corpus act, it was the duty of the
judges and jail-delivery to di&s;charge the pri&s;oner on bail,
if committed for high-trea&s;on, unle&s;s it be made appear,
upon oath, that there are two witne&s;&s;es again&s;t the &s;aid
pri&s;oner, who cannot be produced in that term, &s;e&s;&s;ion,
or general jail-delivery. They likewi&s;e re&s;olved it was
the intention of the &s;aid &s;tatute, that in ca&s;e there &s;hould
be more than one pri&s;oner to be bailed or remanded, there
mu&s;t be oath made that there are two witne&s;&s;es again&s;t
each pri&s;oner, otherwi&s;e he cannot be remanded to pri&s;on.
The&s;e re&s;olutions were entered in the books, as &s;tanding
directions to all future judges, yet not without great oppo|&s;ition
from the court-members. The next debate turned
upon the manner in which the impri&s;oned lords &s;hould be
&s;et at liberty. The conte&s;t became &s;o warm, that the
courtiers began to be afraid, and propo&s;ed an expedient,
which was put in practice. The Hou&s;e adjourned to the
&s;eventeenth day of the month, and at its next meeting
<PB N="166" REF="170">
was given to under&s;tand, that the King had di&s;charged
the impri&s;oned noblemen. After another warm debate, a
formal entry was made in the journals, importing, That
the Hou&s;e being informed of his Maje&s;ty's having given
directions for di&s;charging the lords under bail in the King's
Bench, the debate about that matter cea&s;ed. The re&s;ent|ment
of the peers being thus allayed, they proceeded to
take his Maje&s;ty's &s;peech into con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>&sect; V. The Commons having voted an addre&s;s of thanks,
and another, praying that his Maje&s;ty's foreign alliances
&s;hould be laid before them, determined on a bill for regu|lating
tryals in ca&s;es of high trea&s;on. They pa&s;&s;ed a vote
of thanks to Admiral Ru&s;&s;el, his officers and &s;eamen, for
the victory they had obtained, and then proceeded to an
enquiry, Why that victory had not been pur&s;ued? Why
the de&s;cent had not been made? And why the trade had
not been better protected from the enemy's crui&s;ers? The
Admiral having ju&s;tified his own conduct, they commanded
the Lords of the Admiralty to produce copies of all the
letters and orders which had been &s;ent to the Admiral:
they ordered Ru&s;&s;el to lay before them his an&s;wers; and
the commi&s;&s;ioners of the tran&s;ports, victuallers, and Office
of Ordnance, to deliver in an account of their proceedings.
Then they pre&s;ented addre&s;&s;es to the King and Queen,
acknowledging the favour of God in re&s;toring him to his
people; congratulating him upon his deliverance from the
&s;nares of his open and &s;ecret enemies; and a&s;&s;uring him
they would, according to his Maje&s;ty's de&s;ire in his mo&s;t
gracious &s;peech, be always ready to advi&s;e and a&s;&s;i&s;t him
in the &s;upport of his government. The Queen was
thanked for her gracious and prudent admini&s;tration during
his Maje&s;ty's ab&s;ence: they congratulated her on their
&s;ignal deliverance from a bold and cruel de&s;ign formed for
their de&s;truction, as well as on the glorious victory which
her &s;leet had gained; and they a&s;&s;ured her that the grate|ful
&s;en&s;e they had of their happine&s;s under her govern|ment,
&s;hould always be manife&s;ted in con&s;tant returns of
duty and obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="171">
&sect; VI. After this formal compliment, the Hou&s;e, in&s;tead
of proceeding to the &s;upplies, in&s;i&s;ted upon peru&s;ing the
treaties, publick accounts, and e&s;timates, that they
might be in a condition to advi&s;e, as well as to a&s;&s;i&s;t his
Maje&s;ty. Being indulged with tho&s;e papers, they pa&s;&s;ed
a previous vote, that a &s;upply &s;hould be given: then they
began to concert their articles of advice. Some of the
members loudly complained of partiality to foreign generals,
and particularly reflected upon the in&s;olence of Count
Solmes, and his mi&s;conduct at Steenkerke. After &s;ome
warm altercation, the Hou&s;e re&s;olved one article of their
advice &s;hould be, That his Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to fill
up the vacancies that &s;hould happen among the general
officers, with &s;uch only as were natives of his dominions,
and that the commander in chief of the Engli&s;h &s;hould be
an Engli&s;hman. Their next re&s;olution implied, That
many of the great affairs of the government having been
for &s;ome time pa&s;t un&s;ucce&s;sfully managed, the Hou&s;e
&s;hould advi&s;e his Maje&s;ty to prevent &s;uch mi&s;chiefs for the
future, by employing men of knowledge, ability, and
integrity. Individual members inveighed bitterly again&s;t
cabinet councils, as a novelty in the Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tem of
government, by which the privy-council was jo&s;tled out
of its province. They complained that all the grievances
of the nation proceeded from the vicious principles of the
mini&s;try: they ob&s;erved, that he who oppo&s;ed the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
could not be expected to &s;upport it with zeal.
The Earl of Nottingham was mentioned by name, and
the Hou&s;e re&s;olved that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould be advi&s;ed to
employ in his councils &s;uch per&s;ons only who&s;e principles
obliged them to &s;upport his rights again&s;t the late King,
and all other pretenders. Marlborough's intere&s;t &s;till pre|dominated
among the Commons. His friend Ru&s;&s;el ac|quitted
him&s;elf to the &s;atisfaction of the Hou&s;e, and &s;hifted
the blame of the mi&s;carriage upon his enemy the Earl of
Nottingham, by declaring that twenty days elap&s;ed be|tween
his fir&s;t letter to that nobleman and his lord&s;hip's
an&s;wer. The Earl's friends, of whom there was a great
<PB N="168" REF="172">
number in the Hou&s;e, e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e with great vi|gour,
and even recriminated upon Ru&s;&s;el; &s;o that a very
violent debate en&s;ued. Both parties agreed that there had
been mi&s;management in the &s;cheme of a de&s;cent. It was
moved, that one cau&s;e of the mi&s;carriage was the want of
giving timely and nece&s;&s;ary orders, by tho&s;e to whom the
management of the affair was committed. The Hou&s;e
divided, and it was carried in the affirmative by one voice
only. At the next &s;itting of the committee, Sir Richard
Temple propo&s;ed they &s;hould con&s;ider how to pay the
forces abroad, by means of Engli&s;h manufactures, with|out
exporting money. They re&s;olved that the Hou&s;e
&s;hould be moved to appoint a committee to take this expe|dient
into con&s;ideration. Sir Francis Winnington was
immediately called upon to leave the chair, and the
Speaker re&s;umed his place. All that had been done was
now void, as no report had been made; and the com|mittee
was di&s;&s;olved. The Hou&s;e, however, revived it,
and appointed a day for its &s;itting; but, before it could
re&s;ume its deliberations, Admiral Ru&s;&s;el moved for its
being adjourned, and all its purpo&s;es were defeated.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The court agents had by this time interpo&s;ed,
and &s;ecured a majority by the infamous arts of corruption.
The Commons no longer in&s;i&s;ted upon their points of ad|vice.
Their whole attention was now centered in the
article of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They granted about two millions
for the maintenance of three-and-thirty thou&s;and &s;eamen,
the building of &s;ome additional &s;hips of war, and the
fini&s;hing of Plymouth-dock; and &s;even hundred and fifty
thou&s;and pounds to &s;upply the deficiency of the quarterly
poll. The e&s;timates of the land-&s;ervice were not di&s;cu&s;&s;ed
without tedious debates, and warm di&s;putes. The mini&s;try
demanded fifty-four thou&s;and men, twenty thou&s;and of
whom &s;hould be kept at home for the defence of the na|tion,
while the re&s;t &s;hould &s;erve abroad in the allied army.
Many members declared their aver&s;ion to a foreign war,
in which the nation had no immediate concern, and &s;o
little pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. Others agreed that the allies
<PB N="169" REF="173">
&s;hould be a&s;&s;i&s;ted on the continent with a proportion of
Briti&s;h forces; but that the nation &s;hould act as auxiliary,
not as a principal, and pay no more than what the people
would chearfully contribute to the general expen&s;e. The&s;e
reflexions, however, produced no other effect than that
of prolonging the debate. Mini&s;terial influence had &s;ur|mounted
all oppo&s;ition. The Hou&s;e voted the number of
men demanded. Such was their &s;ervile complai&s;ance,
that when they examined the treaties by which the Engli&s;h
and Dutch contracted equally with the German princes,
and found that, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e treaties, Britain
bore two thirds of the expen&s;e, they overlooked this flagrant
in&s;tance of partiality, and enabled the King to pay the
proportion. Nay, their maxims were &s;o much altered,
that, in&s;tead of pro&s;ecuting their re&s;entment again&s;t fo|reign
generals, they a&s;&s;ented to a motion that the Prince
of Wirtemberg, the Major-Generals, Tetteau and La
Fore&s;t, who commanded the Dani&s;h troops in the pay of
the States-General, &s;hould be indulged with &s;uch an addi|tion
to their appointments as would make up the diffe|rence
between the pay of England and that of Holland.
Finally, they voted above two millions for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence
of the land-forces, and for defraying extraordinary ex|pen&s;es
attending the war upon the continent, including
&s;ub&s;idies to the Electors of Saxony and Hanover.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. The Hou&s;e of Lords, mean while, was not free
from animo&s;ity and contention. The Marlborough faction
exerted them&s;elves with great vivacity. They affirmed, it
was the province of their Hou&s;e to advi&s;e the &s;overeign:
like the Commons, they in&s;i&s;ted upon the King's having
a&s;ked their advice, becau&s;e he had mentioned that word in
his &s;peech, though he never dreamed they would catch at
it with &s;uch eagerne&s;s. They moved, that the ta&s;k of
dige&s;ting the articles of advice &s;hould be undertaken by a
joint committee of both Hou&s;es; but all the dependents
of the court, including the whole bench of bi&s;hops, ex|cept
Wat&s;on of St. David's, were mar&s;halled to oppo&s;e
this motion, which was rejected by a majority of twelve;
<PB N="170" REF="174">
and this victory was followed with a prote&s;t of the van|qui&s;hed.
Notwith&s;tanding this defeat, they pro&s;ecuted
their &s;cheme of giving advice; and, after much wrangling
and declamation, the Hou&s;e agreed in an addre&s;s or re|mon&s;trance,
advi&s;ing and be&s;eeching his Maje&s;ty, That
the commanding officer of the Briti&s;h forces &s;hould be an
Engli&s;hman: That Engli&s;h officers might take rank of
tho&s;e in the confederate armies, who did not belong to
crowned heads: That the twenty thou&s;and men to be left
for the defence of the kingdom &s;hould be all Engli&s;h, and
commanded by an Engli&s;h general: That the practice of
pre&s;&s;ing men for the fleet &s;hould be remedied: that &s;uch
officers as were guilty of this practice &s;hould be ca&s;hiered
and puni&s;hed; and, la&s;tly, That no foreigners &s;hould &s;it
at the board of Ordnance. This addre&s;s was pre&s;ented to
the King, who received it coldly, and &s;aid he would take
it into con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. Then the Lords re&s;olved to enquire into the mi&s;|carriage
of the purpo&s;ed de&s;cent, and called for all the
papers relating to that affair: but the aim of the majority
was not &s;o much to rectify the errors of the government,
as to &s;creen Nottingham, and cen&s;ure Ru&s;&s;el. That noble|man
produced his own book of entries, together with the
whole corre&s;pondence between him and the Admiral, whom
he verbally charged with having contributed to the mi&s;|carriage
of the expedition. This affair was referred to a
committee. Sir John A&s;hby was examined. The Hou&s;e
directed the Earl to draw up the &s;ub&s;tance of his charge;
and the&s;e papers were afterwards delivered to a committee
of the Commons, at a conference, by the Lord Pre&s;ident,
and the re&s;t of the committee above. They were offered
for the in&s;pection of the Commons, as they concerned
&s;ome members of that Hou&s;e, by whom they might be
informed more fully of the particulars they contained. At
another conference, which the Commons demanded,
their committee declared, in the name of the Hou&s;e, That
they had read and well con&s;idered the papers which their
lord&s;hips had &s;ent them, and which they now returned:
<PB N="171" REF="175">
That, finding Mr. Ru&s;&s;el, one of their members, often
mentioned in the &s;aid papers, they had unanimou&s;ly re|&s;olved,
That Admiral Ru&s;&s;el, in his command of the
fleets, during the la&s;t &s;ummer's expedition, had behaved
with fidelity, courage, and conduct. The Lords, irritated
at this declaration, and di&s;appointed in their re&s;entment
again&s;t Ru&s;&s;el, de&s;ired a free conference between the com|mittees
of both Hou&s;es. The Earl of Roche&s;ter told the
Commons, he was commanded by the Hou&s;e of Lords to
inform them, that their lord&s;hips looked upon the late
$ote and proceedings of the Lower Hou&s;e, in returning
their papers, to be irregular and unparliamentary, as they
had not communicated to their lord&s;hips the lights they
had received, and the rea&s;ons upon which their vote was
founded. A paper to the &s;ame purport was delivered to
Colonel Granville, who promi&s;ed to pre&s;ent it to the
Commons, and make a faithful report of what his lord|&s;hip
had &s;aid. Thus the conference ended, and the en|quiry
was di&s;continued.</P>
<P>&sect; X. The Lower Hou&s;e &s;eemed to be as much exa&s;pe|rated
again&s;t the Earl of Nottingham as the Lords were
incen&s;ed at Ru&s;&s;el. A motion was made, that his Maje&s;ty
&s;hould be advi&s;ed to appoint &s;uch commi&s;&s;ioners of the
board of Admiralty as were of known experience in mari|time
affairs. Although this was over-ruled, they voted
an addre&s;s to the King, praying, that, for the future, all
orders for the management of the fleet might pa&s;s through
the hands of the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners; a prote&s;t by impli|cation
again&s;t the conduct of the &s;ecretary. The con&s;ide|ration
of ways and means was the next object that en|gro&s;&s;ed
the attention of the Lower Hou&s;e. They re&s;olved
that a rate of four-&s;hillings in the pound, for one year,
&s;hould be charged upon all lands, according to their
yearly value; as al&s;o upon all per&s;onal e&s;tates, and upon
all offices and employments of profit, other than military
offices in the army or navy. The act founded on this
re&s;olution empowered the King to borrow money on the
credit of it, at &s;even per cent. They further enabled him
<PB N="172" REF="176">
to rai&s;e one million on the general credit of the Exchequer,
by granting annuities. They laid &s;everal new duties on a
variety of imports. They renewed the la&s;t quarterly poll,
providing, that in ca&s;e it &s;hould not produce three hundred
thou&s;and pounds, the deficiencies might be made up by
borrowing on the general credit of the Exchequer. They
continued the impo&s;itions on wine, vinegar, tobacco, and
&s;ugar, for five years; and tho&s;e on Ea&s;t-India goods for
four years. They laid a new impo&s;ition of eight per cent.
on the capital &s;tock of the Ea&s;t-India company, e&s;timated
at &s;even hundred and forty-four thou&s;and pounds: of one
per cent. on the African; of five pounds on every &s;hare of
the &s;tock belonging to the Hud&s;on's-Bay company; and
they empowered his Maje&s;ty to borrow five hundred thou|&s;and
pounds on the&s;e funds, which were expre&s;sly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
for maintaining the war with vigour<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The French King, hearing how liberally William was &s;upplied, ex|claimed with &s;ome emotion, &startq;My little cou&s;in the Prince of Orange is fixed in the &s;addle&mdash;but, no matter, the la&s;t Louis d'or mu&s;t carry it.&endq;</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. The money-bills were retarded in the Upper-Hou&s;e,
by the arts of Hallifax, Mulgrave, and other
malcontents. They grafted a clau&s;e on the land-tax bill,
importing, that the Lords &s;hould tax them&s;elves. It was
adopted by the majority, and the bill &s;ent with this amend|ment
to the Commons, by whom it was unanimou&s;ly re|jected,
as a flagrant attempt upon their privileges. They
demanded a conference, in which they declared that the
clau&s;e in que&s;tion was a notorious encroachment upon the
right the Commons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, of regulating all matters
relating to &s;upplies granted by parliament. When this
report was debated in the Hou&s;e of Lords, the Earl of
Mulgrave di&s;played uncommon powers of eloquence and
argument, in per&s;uading the Hou&s;e, that, by yielding to
this claim of the Commons, they would dive&s;t them|&s;elves
of their true greatne&s;s, and nothing would remain
but the name and &s;hadow of a peer, which was but a
pageant. Notwith&s;tanding all his oratory, the Lords re|linqui&s;hed
their clau&s;e, declaring, at the &s;ame time, that
<PB N="173" REF="177">
they had agreed to pa&s;s the bill without alteration, merely
in regard to the pre&s;ent urgent &s;tate of affairs, as being
otherwi&s;e of opinion, that they had a right to in&s;i&s;t upon
their clau&s;e. A formal complaint being made in the
Hou&s;e of Commons, again&s;t the pamphlet intitled, King
William and Queen Mary Conquerors, as containing a&s;|&s;ertions
of dangerous con&s;equence to their Maje&s;ties, to
the liberty of the &s;ubject, and the peace of the kingdom,
$he licen&s;er and printer were taken into cu&s;tody. The
book being examined, they re&s;olved that it &s;hould be
$urned by the hands of the common hangman; and, that
$he King &s;hould be moved to di&s;mi&s;s the licen&s;er from his
$mployment. The &s;ame &s;entence they pronounced upon a
$a&s;toral letter of Bi&s;hop Burnet, in which the notion of
$onque&s;t had been at fir&s;t a&s;&s;erted. The Lords, in order
$o manife&s;t their &s;entiments on the &s;ame &s;ubject, re&s;olved,
That &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion was highly injurious to their Ma|$e&s;ties,
incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles on which the go|vernment
was founded, and tending to the &s;ubver&s;ion of
the rights of the people. Bohun, the licen&s;er, was brought
$o the bar of the Hou&s;e, and di&s;charged upon his own
$etition, after having been reprimanded on his knees by
the Speaker.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. Several members having complained that their
$ervants had been kidnapped, and &s;ent to &s;erve as &s;oldiers
$word$ Flanders, the Hou&s;e appointed a committee to enquire
$to the abu&s;es committed by pre&s;s-ma&s;ters; and a &s;uita|$le
remon&s;trance was pre&s;ented to the King, who expre&s;&s;ed
$is indignation at this practice, and a&s;&s;ured the Hou&s;e that
$he delinquents &s;hould be brought to exemplary puni&s;h|ment.
Under&s;tanding, however, in the &s;equel, that the
$ethods taken by his Maje&s;ty for preventing this abu&s;e
$ad not proved effectual, they re&s;umed their enquiry,
$nd proceeded with uncommon vigour on the informa|tion
they received. A great number of per&s;ons who had
$een pre&s;&s;ed were di&s;charged by order of the Hou&s;e; and
$apt. Winter, the chief undertaker for this method of
$ecruiting the army, was carried by the Serjeant before the
<PB N="174" REF="178">
Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, that he might be pro&s;ecuted accord|ing
to law.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. Before the heats occa&s;ioned by this unpopular
expedient were allayed, the di&s;content of the nation was
further inflamed by complaints from Ireland, where Lord
Sidney was &s;aid to rule with de&s;potick authority. The&s;e
complaints were exhibited by Sir Francis Brew&s;ter, Sir
William Gore, Sir John Macgill, Lieutenant Stafford,
Mr. Stone, and Mr. Kerne. They were examined at the
bar of the Hou&s;e, and delivered an account of their grie|vances
in writing. Both Hou&s;es concurred in this enquiry,
which being fini&s;hed, they &s;everally pre&s;ented addre&s;&s;es to
the King. The Lords ob&s;erved, That there had been
great abu&s;es in di&s;po&s;ing of the forfeited e&s;tates: That
protections had been granted to the Iri&s;h not included in
the articles of Limerick: &s;o that prote&s;tants were deprived
of the benefit of the law again&s;t them: That the quarters of
the army had not been paid according to the provi&s;ion
made by parliament: That a mayor had been impo&s;ed
upon the city of Dublin for two years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, con|trary
to the ancient privileges and charter: That &s;evera$
per&s;ons accu&s;ed of murder had been executed without
proof; and one Sweetman, the mo&s;t guilty, di&s;charged
without pro&s;ecution. The Commons &s;poke more freely
in their addre&s;s: they roundly explained the abu&s;es and
mi&s;management of that government, by expo&s;ing the pro|te&s;tant
&s;ubjects to the free quarter and violence of a licen|tious
army; by recruiting the troops with Iri&s;h papi&s;ts
who had been in open rebellion again&s;t his Maje&s;ty; by
granting protections to Iri&s;h Roman catholics, whereby
the cour&s;e of the law was &s;topped: by rever&s;ing outlaw
ries for high trea&s;on, not comprehended in the articles o$
Limerick; by letting the forfeited e&s;tates at under value
to the prejudice of his Maje&s;ty's revenue; by embezzling
the &s;tores left in the towns and garri&s;ons by the late King
James, as well as the effects belonging to forfeited e&s;tates
which might have been employed for the better pre&s;erva|tion
of the kingdom; and, finally, by making addition
<PB N="175" REF="179">
to the articles of Limerick, after the capitulation was
&s;igned, and the place &s;urrendered. They mo&s;t humbly
be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty to redre&s;s the&s;e abu&s;es, which had
greatly encouraged the papi&s;ts, and weakened the pro|te&s;tant
intere&s;t in Ireland. The King graciou&s;ly received
both addre&s;&s;es, and promi&s;ed to pay a particular regard to
all remon&s;trances that &s;hould come from either Hou&s;e of
parliament: but no material &s;tep was taken again&s;t the
Lords Sidney, Athlone, and Coning&s;by, who appeared to
have engro&s;&s;ed great part of the forfeitures by grants from
the crown; and even Commi&s;&s;ioner Culliford, who had
been guilty of the mo&s;t grievous acts of oppre&s;&s;ion, e&s;|caped
with impunity.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. The old Whig principle was not yet wholly
expelled from the Lower-Hou&s;e. The undue influence of
the court was exerted in &s;uch an open, &s;candalous man|ner,
as gave offence to the majority of the Commons. In
the mid&s;t of their conde&s;cen&s;ion, Sir Edward Hu&s;&s;ey,
member for Lincoln, brought in a bill touching free and
impartial proceedings in parliament. It was intended to
di&s;able all members of parliament from enjoying places of
tru&s;t and profit, and particularly levelled again&s;t the offi|cers
of the army and navy, who had in&s;inuated them|&s;elves
into the Hou&s;e in &s;uch numbers, that this was com|monly
called the officers parliament. The bill pa&s;&s;ed the
Hou&s;e of Commons, and was &s;ent up to the Lords, by
whom it was read a &s;econd time, and committed: but the
mini&s;try employing their whole &s;trength again&s;t it, on the
report it was thrown out by a majority of two voices. The
Earl of Mulgrave again di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his elo|cution,
in a &s;peech that was held in great veneration by
the people; and, among tho&s;e who entered a prote&s;t in
the journals of the Hou&s;e, when the majority rejected the
bill, was Prince George of Denmark, Duke of Cumberland.
The court had not recollected them&s;elves from the con|&s;ternation
produced by &s;uch a vigorous oppo&s;ition, when
the Earl of Shrew&s;bury produced another bill for triennial
parliaments, providing that there &s;hould be an annual &s;e&s;&s;ion;
<PB N="176" REF="180">
that if, at the expiration of the three years, the crown
&s;hould not order the writs to be i&s;&s;ued, the Lord Chan|cellor,
or keeper, or commi&s;&s;ioner of the great &s;eal,
&s;hould i&s;&s;ue them <HI>ex officio,</HI> and by authority of this act,
under &s;evere penalties. The immediate object of this bill
was the di&s;&s;olution of the pre&s;ent parliament, which had
already &s;at three &s;e&s;&s;ions, and began to be formidable to
the people, from its conce&s;&s;ions to the mini&s;try. The
benefits that would accrue to the con&s;titution from the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of triennial parliaments were very well un|der&s;tood,
as the&s;e points had been frequently di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in
former reigns. The courtiers now objected, that fre|quent
elections would render the freeholders proud and
in&s;olent, encourage faction among the electors, and entail
a continual expen&s;e upon the member, as he would find
him&s;elf obliged, during the whole time of his &s;itting, to
behave like a candidate, con&s;cious how &s;oon the time of
election would revolve. In &s;pite of the mini&s;terial intere&s;t
in the Upper-Hou&s;e, the bill pa&s;&s;ed, and contained a pro|vi&s;o,
that the pre&s;ent parliament &s;hould not continue any
longer than the month of January next en&s;uing. The
court renewed its efforts again&s;t it in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons,
where, neverthele&s;s, it was carried, with &s;ome lit|tle
alterations, which the Lords approved. But all the&s;e
endeavours were fru&s;trated by the prerogative of the
King, who, by refu&s;ing his a&s;&s;ent, prevented its being en|acted
into a law.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. It was at the in&s;tigation of the mini&s;try, that the
Commons brought in a bill for continuing and explaining
certain temporary laws then expiring or expired. Among
the&s;e was an act for re&s;training the liberty of the pre&s;s&punc;
which owed its origin to the reign of Charles II. and had
been revived in the fir&s;t year of the &s;ucceeding reign&punc;
The bill pa&s;&s;ed the Lower-Hou&s;e without difficulty, $word$
met with warm oppo&s;ition in the Hou&s;e of Lords, a good
number of whom prote&s;ted again&s;t it, as a law that &s;ub|jected
all learning and true information to the arbitrary
will of a mercenary, and perhaps ignorant licen&s;er, de|&s;troyed
<PB N="177" REF="181">
the properties of authors, and extended the evil
of monopolies. The bill for regulating trials was dropped,
and, in lieu of it, another produced for the pre&s;ervation
of their Maje&s;ties &s;acred per&s;ons and government: but this
too was rejected by the majority, in con&s;equence of the
mini&s;try's &s;ecret management.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. 1693.</NOTE> The Ea&s;t-India com|pany
narrowly e&s;caped di&s;&s;olution. Petitions and counter-petitions
were delivered into the Hou&s;e of Commons: the
preten&s;ions on both &s;ides were carefully examined: a
committee of the whole Hou&s;e re&s;olved, that there &s;hould
be a new &s;ub&s;cription of a joint-&s;tock, not exceeding two
millions five hundred thou&s;and pounds, to continue for
one-and-twenty years. The report was made and received,
and the publick expected to &s;ee the affair brought to a
&s;peedy i&s;&s;ue: but the company had recour&s;e to the &s;ame
expedients, which had lately proved &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in the
hands of the mini&s;try. Tho&s;e who had been the mo&s;t
warm in detecting their abu&s;es &s;uddenly cooled; and the
pro&s;ecution of the affair began to langui&s;h. Not but that
the Hou&s;e pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, praying
that he would di&s;&s;olve the company upon three years
warning, according to the condition of their charter. He
told them he would con&s;ider their addre&s;s; and they did
not further urge their remon&s;trance. The bill for a&s;cer|taining
the commi&s;&s;ions and &s;alaries of the judges, to which
the King had refu&s;ed the royal a&s;&s;ent in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion,
was revived, twice read, and rejected; and another, for
preventing the exportation and melting of the coin, they
&s;uffered to lie neglected on the table. On the fourteenth
day of March, the King put an end to the &s;e&s;&s;ion, after
having thanked the parliament for &s;o great te&s;timonies
of their affection, and promi&s;ed the &s;upplies &s;hould not
be mi&s;applied. He ob&s;erved, that the po&s;ture of affairs
called him abroad; but that he would leave a &s;ufficient
number of troops for the &s;ecurity o$ the kingdom: he
a&s;&s;ured them he would expo&s;e his per&s;on upon all occa|&s;ions
for the advantage of the&s;e kingdoms; and u&s;e his

<P>&sect; XVI. During the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, Lord Mohun
was indicted and tried by his peers, in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall,
as an accomplice in the murder of one Montford, a cele|brated
comedian, the Marquis of Caermarthen acting as
lord-&s;teward upon this occa&s;ion. The judges having been
con&s;ulted, the peers proceeded to give their judgements
<HI>&s;eriatim,</HI> and Mohun was acquitted by a great majority.
The King, who, from his fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion to the throne,
had endeavoured to trim the balance between the Whigs
and Tories, by mingling them together in his mini&s;try,
made &s;ome alterations at this period, that &s;avoured of
the &s;ame policy. The great-&s;eal, with the title of Lord
Keeper, was be&s;towed upon Sir John Somers, who was
well &s;killed in the law, as in many other branches of po|lite
and u&s;eful literature. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a remarkable ta|lent
for bu&s;ine&s;s, in which he exerted great patience and
a&s;&s;iduity; was gentle, candid, and equitable; a Whig in
principles, yet moderate, pacifick, and conciliating. Of
the &s;ame temper was Sir John Trenchard, now appointed
&s;ecretary of &s;tate. He had been concerned with the Duke
of Monmouth, and e&s;caped to the continent, where he
lived &s;ome years; was calm, &s;edate, well acquainted with
foreign affairs, and con&s;idered as a leading man in his
<PB N="179" REF="183">
party.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV. 1693.</NOTE> The&s;e two are &s;aid to have been promoted at the
recommendation of the Earl of Sunderland, who had
by this time in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the King's favour and
confidence; though his &s;ucce&s;s confirmed the opinion
which many entertained, of his having betrayed his old
ma&s;ter. The leaders of the oppo&s;ition were Sir Edward
Seymour, again become a malcontent, and Sir Chri&s;topher
Mu&s;grave, a gentleman of Cumberland, who, though an
extravagant Tory from principle, had refu&s;ed to concur
with all the de&s;igns of the late King. He was a per&s;on of
a grave and regular deportment, who had rejected many
offers of the mini&s;try,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Hi&s;t. of K. W. Burchet. Lives of the Admirals. Slone's Nar. Feuquieres. Voltaire. Ralph. Ti$ndal. State tracts.</NOTE> which he oppo&s;ed with great vio|lence:
yet on &s;ome critical occa&s;ions, his patrioti&s;m gave
way to his avarice, and he yielded upon &s;ome important
points, in con&s;ideration of large &s;ums which he received
from the court in &s;ecret. Others declared war again&s;t
the admini&s;tration, becau&s;e they thought their own talents
were not &s;ufficiently con&s;idered. Of the&s;e, the chiefs
were Paul Foley and Robert Harley. The fir&s;t was a
lawyer of good capacity, exten&s;ive learning, and virtuous
principles; but peevi&s;h, ob&s;tinate, and moro&s;e. He enter|tained
a very de&s;picable opinion of the court; and this he
propagated with equal a&s;&s;iduity and &s;ucce&s;s. Harley po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
a good fund of learning; was capable of uncommon
application, particularly turned to politicks. He knew the
forms of parliament, had a peculiar dexterity at protract|ing
and perplexing debates; and cheri&s;hed the mo&s;t a|&s;piring
ambition. Admiral Ru&s;&s;el was created trea&s;urer of
the hou&s;ehold; but the command of the fleet was ve&s;ted
in the hands of Killigrew, Delaval, and Shovel. Sir Geo.
Rooke was declared vice-admiral of the red, and John
Lord Berkeley, of the blue divi&s;ion; their rear-admirals
were Matthew Aylmer and David Mitchel.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. The King having vi&s;ited the fleet and fortifi|cations
at Port&s;mouth, given in&s;tructions for annoying the
enemy by &s;ea, and left the admini&s;tration in the hands
of the Queen, embarked on the la&s;t day of March, near
Grave&s;end, and arrived in Holland on the third of April.
<PB N="180" REF="184">
The troops of the confederates were forthwith ordered to
a&s;&s;emble: but while he was employed in making prepara|tions
for the campaign, the French King actually took
the field, attended by Madame de Maintenon, and all the
court ladies. His de&s;ign was &s;uppo&s;ed to be upon &s;ome
town in Brabant: his army amounted to one hundred
and twenty thou&s;and men, completely armed, and abun|dantly
&s;upplied with all nece&s;&s;aries for every &s;ort of mili|tary
operation. King William immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the &s;trong camp at Parke near Louvain, a &s;ituation
which enabled him to cover the places that were mo&s;t ex|po&s;ed.
Under&s;tanding that the French emi&s;&s;aries had &s;own
the &s;eeds of di&s;&s;ention between the Bi&s;hop and chapter of
Liege, he &s;ent the Duke of Wirtemberg thither, to re|concile
the different parties, and concert mea&s;ures for the
further &s;ecurity of the place. He re-enforced the garri|&s;on
with nine battalions; and the Elector Palatine lay
with his troops in readine&s;s to march to its relief. Wil|liam
likewi&s;e threw re-enforcements into Mae&s;tricht,
Huy, and Charleroy; and he him&s;elf re&s;olved to remain
on the defen&s;ive, at the head of &s;ixty thou&s;and men, with
a numerous train of artillery.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. Louis having reviewed his army at Gem|blours,
and &s;een his de&s;igns upon Brabant defeated by the
diligence of his antagoni&s;t, detached Boufflers with twenty
thou&s;and men to the Upper Rhine, to join the Dauphin,
who commanded in that quarter; then leaving the con|duct
of his forces in the Netherlands to the Duke de
Luxembourg, he returned with his court to Ver&s;ailles.
Immediately after his departure, Luxembourg fixed his
head quarters at Mildert; and King William &s;trengthened
his camp on that &s;ide with ten battalions, and eight-and-twenty
pieces of cannon. The enemy's convoys were
frequently &s;urpri&s;ed by detachments from the garri&s;on of
Charleroy; and a large body of hor&s;e, foot, and dragoons,
being drafted out of Liege and Mae&s;tricht, took po&s;t at
Huy, under the command of the Count de Tilly, &s;o as to
&s;traiten the French in their quarters. The&s;e, however,
<PB N="181" REF="185">
were di&s;lodged by Luxembourg in per&s;on, who obliged
the Count to pa&s;s the Jaar with precipitation, leaving be|hind
three &s;quadrons and all his baggage, which fell into
the hands of the enemy. This check, however, was ba|lanced
by the &s;ucce&s;s of the Duke of Wirtemberg, who,
at the head of thirteen battalions of infantry, and twenty
&s;quadrons of hor&s;e, forced the French lines between the
Schelde and the Lys: and laid the whole country as far
as Li&s;le under contribution. On that very day, which was
the eighteenth of July, Luxembourg marched towards
Huy, which was next morning inve&s;ted by M. de Villeroy.
The other covered the &s;iege, and &s;ecured him&s;elf from the
allies by lines of contravallation. Before their batteries
began to play, the town capitulated. On the twenty-third
day of the month, the garri&s;on mutinied; the ca&s;tles
were &s;urrendered; the governor remained a pri&s;oner; and
his men were conducted to Liege. The confederate army
advanced in order to relieve the town: but the King be|ing
appri&s;ed of its fate, detached ten battalions to re-enforce
the garri&s;on of Liege, and next day returned to
Neer-He&s;pen.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. Luxembourg made a motion towards Liege, as
if he had intended to be&s;iege the place; and encamped at
Hellecheim, about &s;even leagues from the confederates.
Knowing how much they were weakened by the different
detachments which had been made from their army, he
re&s;olved to attack them in their camp, or at lea&s;t fall up|on
their rear, &s;hould they retreat at his approach. On the
twenty-eighth day of July, he began his march in four
columns, and pa&s;&s;ed the Jaar near its &s;ource, with an ar|my
&s;uperior to the allies by five-and-thirty thou&s;and men.
The King of England at fir&s;t looked upon this motion as
a feint to cover the de&s;ign upon Liege: but receiving in|telligence
that their whole army was in full march to at|tack
him in his camp, he re&s;olved to keep his ground; and
immediately drew up his forces in order of battle. His
general-officers advi&s;ed him to repa&s;s the Geete: but he
cho&s;e to ri&s;que a battle, rather than expo&s;e the rear of his
<PB N="182" REF="186">
army in repa&s;&s;ing that river. His right wing extended as
far as Neer-Winden, along the Geete, covered with
hedges, hollow-ways, and a &s;mall rivulet: the left reached
to Neer-Landen; and the&s;e two villages were joined by
a &s;light entrenchment, which the King ordered to be
thrown up in the evening. Brigadier Ram&s;ey, with the
regiments of Ofarrel, Mackay, Lauder, Leven, and Mon|roe,
were ordered to the right of the whole army, to line
&s;ome hedges and hollow-ways, on the farther &s;ide of the
village of Lare. Six battalions of Brandenburgh were
po&s;ted to the left of this village; and General Dumont,
with the Hanoverian infantry, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the village of Neer-Winden,
which covered part of the camp, between the
main body and the right wing of the cavalry. Neer-Lan|den
on the left, was &s;ecured by &s;ix battalions of Engli&s;h,
Danes, and Dutch. The remaining infantry was drawn up
in one line behind the entrenchment. The dragoons up|on
the left guarded the village of Dormal upon the brook
of Beck; and from thence the left wing of hor&s;e extend|ed
to Neer-Landen, where it was covered by this rivulet.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. The King having vi&s;ited all the po&s;ts on hor&s;e|back,
and given the nece&s;&s;ary orders, repo&s;ed him&s;elf
about two hours in his coach; and early in the morning
&s;ent for his chaplain, whom he joined in prayer with great
devotion. At &s;un-ri&s;ing the enemy appeared drawn up in
order of battle: and the allies began to play their cannon
with good &s;ucce&s;s. About eight in the morning they at|tacked
the villages of Lare and Neer-Winden with great
fury; and twice made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the&s;e po&s;ts,
from whence they were as often repul&s;ed. The allies &s;till
kept their ground; and, the Duke of Berwick was taken
by his uncle Brigadier Churchill. Then the French made
an attack upon the left wing of the confederates at Neer-Landen;
and, after a very ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, were obliged
to give way, though they &s;till kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ave|nues.
The Prince of Conti, however, renewed the charge
with the &s;lower of the French infantry; and the confe|derates
being overpowered, retreated from the village,
<PB N="183" REF="187">
leaving the camp in that part expo&s;ed. Villeroy marching
this way with a body of hor&s;e, was encountered and re|pul&s;ed
by the Count D'Arco, general of the Bavarian
cuira&s;&s;iers; and the Duke de Chartres narrowly e&s;caped
being taken. Meanwhile, Luxembourg, the Prince of
Conti, the Count de Mar&s;in, and the Mare&s;chal de Joy|eu&s;e,
charged on the right, and in different parts of the
line, with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity as &s;urmounted all re&s;i&s;tance.
The camp of the confederates was immediately filled with
French troops: the villages of Lare and Neer-Winden
were taken, after a long and de&s;perate di&s;pute. The Ha|noverian
and Dutch hor&s;e being broken, the King in per|&s;on
brought the Engli&s;h cavalry to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They
fought with great gallantry; and for &s;ome time retarded
the fate of the day. The infantry was rallied, and &s;tood
firm until all their ammunition was expended. In a word,
they were &s;carce able to &s;u&s;tain the weight of &s;uch a &s;upe|riority
in point of number, when the Marquis D'Har|court
joined the enemy from Huy, with two-and-twenty
fre&s;h &s;quadrons, which immediately turned the &s;cale in
their favour. The Elector of Bavaria, after having made
extraordinary efforts, retreated with great difficulty over
the bridge to the other &s;ide of the river, where he rallied
the troops, in order to favour the retreat of tho&s;e who had
not pa&s;&s;ed. The King &s;eeing the battle lo&s;t, and the
whole army in confu&s;ion, retired with the infantry to
Dormal on the brook of Beck, where the dragoons of
the left wing were po&s;ted, and then ordered the regiments
of Wyndham, Lumley, and Galway, to cover his retreat
over the bridge at Neer-He&s;pen, which he effected with
great difficulty. Now all was tumult, route, and con&s;ter|nation;
and a great number of the fugitives threw them|&s;elves
into the river, where they were drowned. This had
like to have been the fate of the brave Earl of Athlone:
the Duke of Ormond was wounded in &s;everal places, and
taken pri&s;oner by the enemy; and the Count de Solmes
was mortally wounded. Ptolemache brought off the
greater part of the Engli&s;h infantry with great gallantry
<PB N="184" REF="188">
and conduct: as for the baggage, it had been &s;ent to
Liege before the engagement: but, the confederates lo&s;t
&s;ixty pieces of cannon, and nine mortars, a great number
of &s;tandards and colours<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The Duke of Luxembourg &s;ent &s;uch a number of &s;tandards and en&s;igns to Paris, during the cour&s;e of this war, that the Prince of Conti called him the Uphol&s;terer of Notre-Dame, a church in which tho&s;e trophies were di&s;|played.</NOTE>, with about &s;even thou&s;and men
killed and wounded in the action. It mu&s;t be owned that
the allies fought with great valour and per&s;everance; and
that King William made prodigious efforts of courage
and activity to retrieve the fortune of the day. He was
pre&s;ent in all parts of the battle: he charged in per&s;on
both on hor&s;eback and on foot, where the danger was mo&s;t
imminent. His peruke, the &s;leeve of his coat, and the
knot of his &s;carf were penetrated by three different mu&s;|ket-bullets;
and he &s;aw a great number of &s;oldiers fall on
every &s;ide of him. The enemy bore witne&s;s to his ex|traordinary
valour. The Prince of Conti, in a letter to
his Prince&s;s, which was intercepted, declared, that he
&s;aw the Prince of Orange expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the greate&s;t
dangers: and that &s;uch valour richly de&s;erved the peace|able
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown he wore. Yet here, as in
every other battle he fought, his conduct and di&s;po&s;ition
were &s;everely cen&s;ured. Luxembourg having ob&s;erved the
nature of his &s;ituation immediately before the engagement,
is &s;aid to have exclaimed, &startq;Now, I believe Waldeck is
really dead;&endq; alluding to that general's known &s;agacity
in choo&s;ing ground for an encampment. Be that as it
will, he paid dear for his victory. His lo&s;s in officers
and men exceeded that of the allies; and he reaped no
&s;olid advantage from the battle. He remained fifteen
days inactive at Waren, while King William, recalling
the Duke of Wirtemberg, and drafting troops from
Liege and other garri&s;ons, was in a few days able to ha|zard
another engagement.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. Nothing remarkable happened during the re|maining
part of the campaign, until Luxembourg, being
<PB N="185" REF="189">
rejoined by Boufflers with a &s;trong re-enforcement from
the Rhine, inve&s;ted Charleroy. He had taken his mea|&s;ures
with &s;uch caution and dexterity, that the allies
could not fru&s;trate his operations, without attacking his
lines at a great di&s;advantage. The King detached the
Elector of Bavaria and the Duke of Wirtemberg, with
thirty battalions and forty &s;quadrons, to make a diver&s;ion
in Flanders: but, they returned in a few days, without
having attempted any thing of con&s;equence. The garri&s;on
of Charleroy defended the place with &s;urpri&s;ing valour,
from the tenth of September to the eleventh of October,
during which period they had repul&s;ed the a&s;&s;ailants in
&s;everal attacks: but, at length, de&s;pairing of relief, the
governor capitulated on the mo&s;t honourable conditions:
the reduction of the place was celebrated with a <HI>Te Deum,</HI>
and other rejoicings at Paris. Louis, however, in the
mid&s;t of all his glory, was extremely mortified when he
reflected upon the little advantage he had reaped from all
his late victories. The allies had been defeated &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively
at Flerus, Steenkerke and Landen: yet in a fort|night
after each of tho&s;e battles, William was always in
a condition to ri&s;que another engagement. Formerly
Louis had conquered half of Holland, Flanders, and
Franche-Comt&eacute;, without a battle; whereas, now he
could not with his utmo&s;t efforts, and after the mo&s;t
&s;ignal victories, pa&s;s the frontiers of the United Provinces.
The conque&s;t of Charleroy concluded the campaign in
the Netherlands, and both armies went into winter-quarters.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. The French army on the Rhine, under De
Lorges, pa&s;&s;ed that river in the month of May at Philip&s;|burgh,
and inve&s;ted the city of Heidelberg, which they
took, plundered, and reduced to a&s;hes. This general
committed numberle&s;s barbarities in the Palatinate, which
he ravaged without even &s;paring the tombs of the dead.
The French &s;oldiers, on this occa&s;ion, &s;eem to have been
actuated by the mo&s;t brutal inhumanity. They butchered
the inhabitants, violated the women, plundered the
<PB N="186" REF="190">
hou&s;es, rifled the churches, and murthered prie&s;ts at the
altar. They broke open the electoral vault, and &s;cattered
the a&s;hes of that illu&s;trious family about the &s;treets. They
&s;et fire to different quarters of the city: they &s;tripped
about fifteen thou&s;and of the inhabitants, without di|&s;tinction
of age or &s;ex, and drove them naked into the
ca&s;tle, that the garri&s;on might be the &s;ooner induced to
capitulate. There they remained like cattle in the open
air, without food or covering, tortured between the
horrours of their fate and the terrours of a bombardment.
When they were &s;et at liberty, in con&s;equence of the
fort's being &s;urrendered, a great number of them died
along the banks of the Neckar, from cold, hunger, an|gui&s;h,
and de&s;pair. The&s;e enormous cruelties, which
would have di&s;graced the arms of a Tartarian freebooter,
were acted by the expre&s;s command of Louis XIV. of
France, who has been celebrated by &s;o many venal pens,
not only as the greate&s;t monarch, but al&s;o as the mo&s;t
poli&s;hed prince of Chri&s;tendom. De Lorges advanced
towards the Neckar again&s;t the Prince of Baden, who lay
encamped on the other &s;ide of that river: but in attempt|ing
to pa&s;s, he was twice repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable da|mage.
The Dauphin joining the army, which now
amounted to &s;eventy thou&s;and men, cro&s;&s;ed without oppo|&s;ition;
but, found the Germans &s;o advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted,
that he would not hazard an attack: having, therefore,
repa&s;&s;ed the river, he &s;ecured Stutgard with a garri&s;on,
&s;ent detachments into Flanders and Piedmont, and re|turned
in Augu&s;t to Ver&s;ailles. In Piedmont the allies
were &s;till more unfortunate. The Duke of Savoy and his
confederates &s;eemed bent upon driving the French from
Ca&s;al and Pignerol. The fir&s;t of the&s;e places was blocked
up, and the other actually inve&s;ted. The fort of St.
Bridget, that covered the place, was taken, and the town
bombarded. Mean while Catinat being re-enforced&punc;
de&s;cended into the plains. The Duke was &s;o apprehen|&s;ive
of Turin, that he abandoned the &s;iege of Pignerol
after having blown up the fort, and marched in que&s;t o$
<PB N="187" REF="191">
the enemy to the plain of Mar&s;aglia, in the neighbourhood
of his capital. On the fourth day of October, the French
advanced upon them from the hills, between Orba&s;&s;on
and Pro&s;a&s;que; and a de&s;perate engagement en&s;ued. The
enemy charged the left wing of the confederates &s;word in
hand with incredible fury: though they were once re|pul&s;ed,
they renewed the attack with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity,
that the Neapolitan and Milane&s;e hor&s;e were obliged to
give way, and di&s;ordered the German cavalry. The&s;e
falling upon the foot, threw the whole wing into con|fu&s;ion.
Meanwhile, the main body and the other wing
&s;u&s;tained the charge without flinching, until they were
expo&s;ed in flank by the defeat of the cavalry: then the
whole front gave way. In vain the &s;econd line was brought
up to &s;u&s;tain them: the hor&s;e turned their backs, and the
infantry was totally routed. In a word, the confederates
were obliged to retire with precipitation, leaving their
cannon, and about eight thou&s;and men killed or wounded
on the field of battle. The Duke of Schomberg having
been denied the po&s;t which was his due, in&s;i&s;ted upon
fighting at the head of the troops maintained by the
King of Great-Britain, who were po&s;ted in the centre,
and behaved with great gallantry under the eye of their
commander. When the left wing was defeated, the
Count de los Torres de&s;ired he would take upon him the
command, and retreat with the infantry and right wing:
but, he refu&s;ed to act without the order of his highne&s;s,
and &s;aid, things were come to &s;uch a pa&s;s, that they mu&s;t
either conquer or die&punc; He continued to animate his men
with his voice and example, until he received a &s;hot in
the thigh. His valet &s;eeing him fall, ran to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
and called for quarter, but was killed by the enemy be|fore
he could be under&s;tood. The Duke being taken at
the &s;ame in&s;tant, was afterwards di&s;mi&s;&s;ed upon his
parole, and in a few days died at Turin, univer&s;ally la|mented
on account of his great and amiable qualities.
The Earl of Warwick and Holland, who accompanied
him as a volunteer, &s;hared his fate in being wounded and
<PB N="188" REF="192">
taken pri&s;oner: but he &s;oon recovered his health and
liberty. This victory was as un&s;ub&s;tantial as that of
Landen, and almo&s;t as dear in the purcha&s;e; for, the
confederates made an ob&s;tinate defence, and yielded &s;olely
to &s;uperior number. The Duke of Savoy retreated to
Moncalier, and threw a re-enforcement into Conti, which
Catinat would not venture to be&s;iege, &s;o &s;everely had he
been handled in the battle. He, therefore, contented
him&s;elf with laying the country under contribution, re-enforcing
the garri&s;ons of Ca&s;al, Pignerol, and Su&s;a, and
making preparations for repa&s;&s;ing the mountains. The
news of the victory no &s;ooner reached Paris, than Louis
di&s;patched M. de Chanlais to Turin, with propo&s;als for
detaching the Duke of Savoy from the intere&s;t of the
allies; and the Pope, who was now become a parti&s;an of
France, &s;upported the negociation with his whole in|fluence:
but the French King had not yet touched upon
the right &s;tring. The Duke continued deaf to all his ad|dre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. France had been alike &s;ucce&s;sful in her in|trigues
at the courts of Rome and Con&s;tantinople. The
Vi&s;ir at the Porte had been converted into a pen&s;ionary
and creature of Louis; but, the war in which the Turks
had been &s;o long and un&s;ucce&s;sfully engaged rendered
him &s;o odious to the people, that the Grand Signor depo&s;ed
him, in order to appea&s;e their clamours. The Engli&s;h
and Dutch amba&s;&s;adors at Con&s;tantinople forthwith re|newed
their mediation for a peace with the Emperor; but
the terms they propo&s;ed were &s;till rejected with di&s;dain.
In the mean time General Heu&s;ler, who commanded the
Imperiali&s;ts in Tran&s;ylvania, reduced the fortre&s;&s;es of Jeno
and Villagu&s;war. In the beginning of July the Duke de
Croy a&s;&s;umed the chief command of the German army,
pa&s;&s;ed the Danube and the Saave, and inve&s;ted Belgrade.
The &s;iege was carried on for &s;ome time with great vigour:
but, at length, abandoned at the approach of the Vi&s;ir,
who obliged the Imperiali&s;ts to repa&s;s the Saave, and &s;ent
out parties which made incur&s;ions into Upper-Hungary.
<PB N="189" REF="193">
The power of France had never been &s;o con&s;picuous as at
this juncture, when &s;he maintained a formidable navy at
&s;ea, and four great armies in different parts of Europe.
Exclu&s;ive of the operations in Flanders, Germany, and
Piedmont, the Count de Noailles inve&s;ted Ro&s;es in Cata|lonia,
about the latter end of May, while at the &s;ame
time it was blocked up by the French fleet, under the
command of the Count D'Etrees. In a few days the place
was &s;urrendered by capitulation, and the ca&s;tle of Ampu|rias
met with the &s;ame fate. The Spani&s;h power was
reduced to &s;uch a degree, that Noailles might have pro|ceeded
in his conque&s;ts without interruption, had not he
been obliged to detach part of his army to re-enforce
Catinat in Piedmont.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. Nothing could be more inglorious for the
Engli&s;h than their operations by &s;ea in the cour&s;e of this
&s;ummer. The King had ordered the admirals to u&s;e all
po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch in equipping the fleets, that they might
block up the enemy in their own ports, and protect the
commerce, which had &s;uffered &s;everely from the French
privateers. They were, however, &s;o dilatory in their
proceedings, that the &s;quadrons of the enemy &s;ailed from
their harbours before the Engli&s;h fleet could put to &s;ea.
About the middle of May it was a&s;&s;embled at St. Helen's,
and took on board &s;ive regiments, intended for a de&s;cent
on Bre&s;t; but this enterpri&s;e was never attempted. When
the Engli&s;h and Dutch &s;quadrons joined, &s;o as to form a
very numerous $leet, the publick expected they would
undertake &s;ome expedition of importance: but the ad|mirals
were divided in opinion, nor did their orders
warrant their executing any &s;cheme of con&s;equence.
Killigrew and Delaval did not e&s;cape the &s;u&s;picion of being
di&s;affected to the &s;ervice; and France was &s;aid to have
maintained a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with the malcontents
in England. Louis had made &s;urpri&s;ing efforts to repair
the damage which his navy had &s;u&s;tained. He had pur|cha&s;ed
&s;everal large ve&s;&s;els, and converted them into &s;hips
of war: he had laid an embargo on all the &s;hipping of his
<PB N="190" REF="194">
kingdom, until his &s;quadrons were manned: he had made
a grand naval promotion, to encourage the officers and
&s;eamen; and this expedient produced a wonderful &s;pirit
of activity and emulation. In the month of May his fleet
&s;ailed to the Mediterranean, in three &s;quadrons, con&s;i&s;ting
of &s;eventy-one capital &s;hips, be&s;ides bomb-ketches, fire|&s;hips,
and tenders.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. In the beginning of June, the Engli&s;h and
Dutch fleets &s;ailed down the channel. On the &s;ixth, Sir
George Rooke was detached to the Straits with a &s;quadron
of three-and-twenty &s;hips, as convoy to the Mediterranean
trade. The great fleet returned to Torbay, while he
pur&s;ued his voyage, having under his protection about
four hundred merchant &s;hips belonging to England, Hol|land,
Denmark, Sweden, Hamburgh, and Flanders.
On the &s;ixteenth, his &s;couts di&s;covered part of the French
fleet under Cape St. Vincent: next day their whole navy
appeared, to the amount of eighty &s;ail. Sixteen of the&s;e
plied up to the Engli&s;h &s;quadron, while the vice-admiral
of the white &s;tood off to &s;ea, to intercept the &s;hips under
convoy. Sir George Rooke, by the advice of the Dutch
vice-admiral Vandergoes, re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to avoi$
an engagement, which could only tend to their ab&s;olut$
ruin. He forthwith &s;ent orders to the &s;mall &s;hips tha$
were near the land, to put into the neighbouring ports o$
Faro, St. Lucar, and Cadix, while he him&s;elf &s;tood of
with an ea&s;y &s;ail for the protection of the re&s;t. About $word$
in the evening, ten &s;ail of the enemy came up with tw$
Dutch &s;hips of war, commanded by the Captains Schrijve
and Vander-Poel, who &s;eeing no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping
tacked in &s;hore; and, thus drawing the French afte$
them, helped to &s;ave the re&s;t of the &s;leet. When attacke$
they made a mo&s;t de&s;perate defence, but at la&s;t were over
powered by numbers, and taken. An Engli&s;h &s;hip $word$
war and a rich pinnace were burned; nine and twent
merchant-ve&s;&s;els were taken, and about fifty de&s;troyed $word$
the Counts de Tourville and D'Etrees. Seven of th$
large&s;t Smyrna &s;hips fell into the hands of M. de $word$,
<PB N="191" REF="195">
and four he &s;unk in the bay of Gibraltar. The
value of the lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained on this occa&s;ion amounted to
one million &s;terling. Mean while Rooke &s;tood off with a
fre&s;h gale, and on the nineteenth &s;ent home the Lark &s;hip
of war with the news of his misfortune; then he bore
away for the Madeiras, where having taken in wood and
water, he &s;et &s;ail for Ireland, and on the third day of
Augu&s;t arrived at Cork, with fifty &s;ail, including &s;hips of
war and trading ve&s;&s;els. He detached Captain Fairborne
to Kin&s;ale, with all his &s;quadron, except &s;ix &s;hips of the
$line, with which, in pur&s;uance of orders, he joined the
great fleet then crui&s;ing in the chops of the channel. On
the twenty-fifth day of Augu&s;t, they returned to St.
Helen's, and the four regiments were landed. On the
nineteenth day of September, fifteen Dutch &s;hips of the
line, and two frigates, &s;et &s;ail for Holland; and twenty-&s;ix
&s;ail, with &s;even fire&s;hips, were a&s;&s;igned as guard-&s;hips
during the winter.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. The French admirals, in&s;tead of pur&s;uing
Rooke to Madeira, made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt upon
Cadix, and bombarded Gibraltar, where the merchants
$unk their &s;hips, that they might not fall into the hands of
$he enemy. Then they &s;ailed along the coa&s;t of Spain,
de&s;troyed &s;ome Engli&s;h and Dutch ve&s;&s;els at Malaga, Ali|$ant,
and other places; and returned in triumph to Tou|$on.
About this period, Sir Francis Wheeler returned to
England with his &s;quadron, from an unfortunate expe|$ition
in the We&s;t-Indies. In conjunction with Colonel
$odrington, governor of the Leeward i&s;lands, he made
un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts upon the i&s;lands of Martinique and
$ominique. Then he &s;ailed to Bo&s;ton in New-England,
$ith a view to concert an expedition again&s;t Quebec,
which was judged impracticable. He afterwards &s;teered
$or Placentia in Newfoundland, which he would have at|$$cked
without he&s;itation; but the de&s;ign was rejected by
$word$ majority of voices in the council of war. Thus di&s;ap|pointed,
he &s;et &s;ail for England; and arrived at Port&s;|mouth
<PB N="192" REF="196">
in a very &s;hattered condition, the greater part of
his men having died in the cour&s;e of this voyage.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. In November another effort was made to
annoy the enemy. Commodore Benbow &s;ailed with a
&s;quadron of twelve capital &s;hips, four bomb-ketches, and
ten brigantines, to the coa&s;t of St. Maloes, and anchoring
within half a mile of the town, cannonaded and bombarded
it for three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. Then his men landed on
an i&s;land, where they burned a convent. On the nine|teenth,
they took the advantage of a dark night, a fre&s;h
gale, and a &s;trong tide, to &s;end in a fire&s;hip of a particular
contrivance, &s;tiled the Infernal, in order to burn the town:
but, &s;he &s;truck upon a rock before &s;he arrived at the place,
and the engineer was obliged to &s;et her on fire, and retreat.
She continued burning for &s;ome time, and at la&s;t blew
up, with &s;uch an explo&s;ion as &s;hook the whole town like
an earthquake, unroofed three hundred hou&s;es, and broke
all the gla&s;s and earthen ware for three leagues around.
A cap&s;tan that weighed two hundred pounds was tran&s;|ported
into the place, and falling upon a hou&s;e, levelled it
to the ground: the greate&s;t part of the wall towards the
&s;ea tumbled down; and the inhabitants were overwhelmed
with con&s;ternation: &s;o that a &s;mall number of troops
might have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion without re&s;i&s;tance; but there
was not a &s;oldier on board. Neverthele&s;s, the &s;ailors took
and demoli&s;hed Quince-fort, and did con&s;iderable damage
to the town of St. Maloes, which had been a ne&s;t of pri|vateers
that in&s;e&s;ted the Engli&s;h commerce. Though this
attempt was executed with great &s;pirit, and &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s,
the clamours of the people became louder and louder.
They &s;crupled not to &s;ay, that the councils of the nation
were betrayed; and their &s;u&s;picions ro&s;e even to the &s;ecre|tary's
office. They ob&s;erved, that the French were pre|viou&s;ly
acquainted with all the motions of the Engli&s;h, an$
took their mea&s;ures accordingly for their de&s;truction
They collected and compared a good number of particu|lars,
that &s;eemed to ju&s;tify their &s;u&s;picion of treachery
But the misfortunes of the nation, in all probability, aro&s;$
<PB N="193" REF="197">
from a motley mini&s;try, divided among them&s;elves, who,
in&s;tead of acting in concert for the publick good, em|ployed
all their influence to thwart the views, and blacken
the reputations of each other. The people in general ex|claimed
again&s;t the Marquis of Caermarthen, the Earls
of Nottingham and Roche&s;ter, who had acquired great
credit with the Queen, and, from their hatred to the
Whigs, betrayed the intere&s;ts of the nation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. But if the Engli&s;h were di&s;contented, the
French were mi&s;erable, in &s;pite of all their victories. That
kingdom laboured under a dreadful famine, occa&s;ioned
partly from unfavourable &s;ea&s;ons, and partly from the war,
which had not left hands &s;ufficient to cultivate the ground.
Notwith&s;tanding all the diligence and providence of their
mini&s;try, in bringing &s;upplies of corn from Sweden and
Denmark, their care in regulating the price, and furni&s;h|ing
the markets, their liberal contributions for the relief
of the indigent; multitudes peri&s;hed of want, and the
whole kingdom was reduced to poverty and di&s;tre&s;s.
Louis pined in the mid&s;t of his &s;ucce&s;s. He &s;aw his &s;ub|jects
exhau&s;ted by a ruinous war, in which they had been
involved by his ambition. He tampered with the allies
apart, in hopes of dividing and detaching them from the
grand confederacy: he &s;ollicited the northern crowns to
engage as mediators for a general peace. A memorial
was actually pre&s;ented by the Dani&s;h mini&s;ter to King
William, by which it appears, that the French King
would have been contented to purcha&s;e a peace with &s;ome
con&s;iderable conce&s;&s;ions: but the terms were rejected by
the King of England, who&s;e ambition and revenge were
not yet gratified; and who&s;e &s;ubjects, though heavy
laden, could &s;till bear additional burthens.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. The Jacobites had been very attentive to the
progre&s;s of di&s;&s;atisfaction in England, which they fomented
with their u&s;ual a&s;&s;iduity. The late declaration of King
James had been couched in &s;uch imperious terms as gave
offence even to &s;ome of tho&s;e who favoured his intere&s;t.
The Earl of Middleton, therefore, in the beginning of the
<PB N="194" REF="198">
year repaired to St. Germain's, and obtained another,
which contained the promi&s;e of a general pardon without
exceptions, and every other conce&s;&s;ion that a Briti&s;h &s;ub|ject
could demand of his &s;overeign. About the latter end
of May, two men, named Canning and Dormer, were ap|prehended
for di&s;per&s;ing copies of this paper, tried at the
Old-Bailey, found guilty of not only di&s;per&s;ing, but al&s;o
of compo&s;ing a fal&s;e and &s;editious libel, &s;entenced to pay
five hundred marks a-piece, to &s;tand three times in the
pillory, and find &s;ureties for their good behaviour. But
no circum&s;tance reflected more di&s;grace on this reign, than
the fate of Anderton, the &s;uppo&s;ed printer of &s;ome tracts
again&s;t the government. He was brought to tryal for high-trea&s;on:
he made a vigorous defence, in &s;pite of the in&s;ults
and di&s;couragements he &s;u&s;tained from a partial bench. As
nothing but pre&s;umptions appeared again&s;t him, the jury
&s;crupled to bring in a verdict that would affect his life,
until they were reviled and reprimanded by Judge Treby;
then they found him guilty. In vain recour&s;e was had to
the Queen's mercy: he &s;uffered death at Tyburn; and
left a paper, prote&s;ting &s;olemnly again&s;t the proceedings of
the court, which he affirmed was appointed, not to try,
but to convict him; and petitioning heaven to forgive his
penitent jury. The &s;everity of the government was like|wi&s;e
exemplified in the ca&s;e of &s;ome adventurers, who
having equipped privateers to crui&s;e upon the Engli&s;h,
under joint commi&s;&s;ions from the late King James and
Louis XIV. happened to be taken by the Engli&s;h &s;hips of
war. Dr. Oldys, the King's advocate, being commanded
to proceed again&s;t them as guilty of trea&s;on and piracy,
refu&s;ed to commence the pro&s;ecution; and gave his opi|nion
in writing, that they were neither traitors nor pirates.
He &s;upported this opinion by arguments before the council:
the&s;e were an&s;wered by Dr. Littleton, who &s;ucceeded him
in the office from which he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and the pri|&s;oners
were executed as traitors. The Jacobites did not
fail to retort tho&s;e arts upon the government, which their
adver&s;aries had &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully practi&s;ed in the late reign.
<PB N="195" REF="199">
They inveighed again&s;t the vindictive &s;pirit of the admi|ni&s;tration,
and taxed it with encouraging informers and
fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es; a charge for which there was too much
foundation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. The friends of James in Scotland &s;till conti|nued
to concert de&s;igns in his favour: but their corre|&s;pondence
was detected, and their aims defeated, by the
vigilance of the mini&s;try in that kingdom. Secretary
John&s;ton not only kept a watchful eye over all their
tran&s;actions, but, by a dexterous management of court
liberality and favour, appea&s;ed the di&s;contents of the pre&s;|byterians
&s;o effectually, that the King ran no ri&s;que in
a&s;&s;embling the parliament. Some offices were be&s;towed
upon the leaders of the kirk-party; and the Duke of Ha|milton
being reconciled to the government, was appointed
commi&s;&s;ioner. On the eighteenth day of April, the &s;e&s;&s;ion
was opened, and the King's letter, replete with the mo&s;t
cajoling expre&s;&s;ions, being read, the parliament proceeded
to exhibit undeniable &s;pecimens of their good-humour.
They drew up a very affectionate an&s;wer to his Maje&s;ty's
letter: They voted an addition of &s;ix new regiments to
the &s;tanding forces of the kingdom: They granted a &s;up|ply
of above one hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds &s;ter|ling
to his Maje&s;ty: They enacted a law for levying men
to &s;erve on board the royal navy: They fined all ab|&s;entees,
whether Lords or Commons; and vacated the
&s;eats of all tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners who refu&s;ed to take the
oath of a&s;&s;urance, which was equivalent to an abjuration
of King James: They &s;et on foot an enquiry about an in|tended
inva&s;ion: They publi&s;hed &s;ome intercepted letters,
&s;uppo&s;ed to be written to King James by Nevil Payne,
whom they committed to pri&s;on, and threatened with a
tryal for high trea&s;on; but he eluded the danger, by
threatening in his turn to impeach tho&s;e who had made
their peace with the government: They pa&s;&s;ed an act for
the comprehen&s;ion of &s;uch of the epi&s;copal clergy as &s;hould
conde&s;cend to take the oaths by the tenth day of July.
All that the general a&s;&s;embly required of them, was, an
<PB N="196" REF="200">
offer to &s;ub&s;cribe the confe&s;&s;ion of faith, and to acknow|ledge
pre&s;bytery as the only government of the Scotti&s;h
church: but they neither &s;ubmitted to the&s;e terms, nor
took the oaths within the limited time; &s;o that they for|feited
all legal right to their benefices. Neverthele&s;s, they
continued in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and even received private a&s;&s;ur|ances
of the King's protection. It was one of William's
political maxims, to court his dome&s;tick enemies; but it
was never attended with any good effect. This indul|gence
gave offence to the pre&s;byterians, and former di|&s;tractions
began to revive.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. The King having prevailed upon the States-General
to augment their land-forces and navy for the &s;er|vice
of the en&s;uing campaign, embarked for England, and
arrived at Ken&s;ington on the thirtieth day of October.
Finding the people clamorous and di&s;contented, the trade
of the nation decayed, the affairs of &s;tate mi&s;managed, and
the mini&s;ters recriminating upon one another, he per|ceived
the nece&s;&s;ity of changing hands, and re&s;olved to
take his mea&s;ures accordingly. Sunderland, his chief
coun&s;ellor, repre&s;ented, that the Tories were aver&s;e to the
continuance of a war, which had been productive of no|thing
but damage and di&s;grace; whereas, the Whigs were
much more practicable, and would bleed freely, partly
from the terrours of inva&s;ion and popery, partly from the
ambition of being courted by the crown, and partly from
the pro&s;pect of advantage, in advancing money to the
government on the funds e&s;tabli&s;hed by parliament: for
that &s;ort of traffick which obtained the appellation of the
monied-intere&s;t was altogether a whiggi&s;h in&s;titution.
The King revolved the&s;e ob&s;ervations in his own mind;
and, in the mean time, the parliament met on the &s;eventh
day of November, pur&s;uant to the la&s;t prorogation. In
his &s;peech, he expre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment again&s;t tho&s;e who
were the authors of the mi&s;carriages at &s;ea; repre&s;ente$
the nece&s;&s;ity of increa&s;ing the land-forces and the navy
and demanded a &s;uitable &s;upply for the&s;e purpo&s;es. I$
order to pave the way to their conde&s;cen&s;ion, he had already
<PB N="197" REF="201">
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his council the Earl of Nottingham, who,
of all his mini&s;ters, was the mo&s;t odious to the people.
His place would have been immediately filled with the
Earl of Shrew&s;bury: but that nobleman, &s;u&s;pecting this
was a change of men rather than of mea&s;ures, &s;tood aloof
for &s;ome time, until he received &s;uch a&s;&s;urances from the
King as quieted his &s;cruples, and then he accepted the
office of &s;ecretary. The lieutenancy for the city of Lon|don,
and all other commi&s;&s;ions over England, were altered
with a view to favour the Whig intere&s;t; and the indi|viduals
of that party were indulged with many places of
tru&s;t and profit: but the Tories were too powerful in the
Hou&s;e of Commons to be exa&s;perated, and therefore a
good number of them were retained in office.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. On the &s;ixth day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, the Com|mons
unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to &s;upport their Maje&s;ties and
their government; to enquire into mi&s;carriages; and to
con&s;ider means for pre&s;erving the trade of the nation.
The Turkey company were &s;ummoned to produce the pe|titions
they had delivered to the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Ad|miralty
for convoy: Lord Falkland, who &s;at at the head
of that board, gave in copies of all the orders and di|rections
&s;ent to Sir George Rooke concerning the Straits
fleet, together with a li&s;t of all the &s;hips at that time in
commi&s;&s;ion. It appeared, in the cour&s;e of this enquiry,
that the mi&s;carriage of Rooke's fleet was in a great mea&s;ure
owing to the mi&s;conduct of the Admirals, and neglect of
the Victualling-Office: but they were &s;kreened by a ma|jority.
Mr. Harley, one of the commi&s;&s;ioners for taking
and &s;tating the publick accounts, delivered a report, which
contained a charge of peculation again&s;t Lord Falkland.
Rainsford, receiver of the rights and perqui&s;ites of the
navy, confe&s;&s;ed that he had received and paid more money
than that which was charged in the accounts; and, in
particular, that he had paid four thou&s;and pounds to
Lord Falkland, by his Maje&s;ty's order. This lord had
acknowledged before the commi&s;&s;ioners, that he had paid
one half of the &s;um, by the King's order, to a per&s;on who
<PB N="198" REF="202">
was not a member of either Hou&s;e; and that the remainder
was &s;till in his hands. Rainsford owned he had the
original letter which he received from Falkland, demand|ing
the money; and this nobleman de&s;iring to &s;ee it, de|tained
the voucher; a circum&s;tance that incen&s;ed the Com|mons
to &s;uch a degree, that a motion was made for com|mitting
him to the Tower, and debated with great warmth,
but at la&s;t over-ruled by the majority. Neverthele&s;s,
they agreed to make him &s;en&s;ible of their di&s;plea&s;ure, and
he was reprimanded in his place. The Hou&s;e of Lords
having al&s;o enquired into the cau&s;es of the mi&s;carriage at
&s;ea, very violent debates aro&s;e, and at length the majority
re&s;olved, that the admirals had done well in the execution
of the orders they had received. This was a triumph
over the Whig lords, who had &s;o eagerly pro&s;ecuted the
affair, and now prote&s;ted again&s;t the re&s;olution, not with|out
great appearance of rea&s;on. The next &s;tep of the
Lords, was to exculpate the Earl of Nottingham, as the
blame &s;eemed to lie with him, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the
admirals were innocent. With a view, therefore, to trans|fer
this blame to Trenchard, the whiggi&s;h &s;ecretary, the
Earl gave the Hou&s;e to under&s;tand, that he had received
intelligence from Paris in the beginning of June, con|taining
a li&s;t of the enemy's fleet, and the time of their
&s;ailing; that this was communicated to a committee of the
council, and particularly imparted to Secretary Trenchard,
who&s;e province it was to tran&s;mit in&s;tructions to the ad|mirals.
Two conferences pa&s;&s;ed on this &s;ubject between
the Lords and Commons. Trenchard delivered in his
defence in writing; and was in his turn &s;kreened by the
whole efforts of the mini&s;try, in which the Whig influ|ence
now predominated. Thus, an enquiry of &s;uch na|tional
con&s;equence, which took its ri&s;e from the King's
own expre&s;&s;ion of re&s;entment again&s;t the delinquents, was
&s;tifled by the arts of the court, becau&s;e it was likely to af|fect
one of its creatures: for, though there was no pre|meditated
treachery in the ca&s;e, the intere&s;t of the publick
was certainly &s;acrificed to the mutual animo&s;ity of the
<PB N="199" REF="203">
mini&s;ters. The charge of Lord Falkland being re&s;umed
in the Hou&s;e of Commons, he appeared to have begged
and received of the King the remaining two thou&s;and
pounds of the money which had been paid by Rainsford:
he was, therefore, declared guilty of a high mi&s;demeanor
and breach of tru&s;t, and committed to the Tower; from
whence, however, he was in two days di&s;charged upon
his petition.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. Harley, Foley, and Harcourt, pre&s;ented
to the Hou&s;e a &s;tate of the receipts and i&s;&s;ues of the re|venue,
together with two reports from the commi&s;&s;ioners
of accounts, concerning &s;ums i&s;&s;ued for &s;ecret-&s;ervices,
and to members of parliament. This was a di&s;covery of
the mo&s;t &s;candalous practices in the my&s;tery of corruption,
equally exerci&s;ed on the individuals of both parties, in
occa&s;ional bounties, grants, places, pen&s;ions, equivalents,
and additional &s;alaries. The malcontents, therefore,
ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, the Hou&s;e of Commons was &s;o managed
that the King could baffle any bill, qua&s;h all grievances,
&s;tifle accounts, and rectify the articles of Limerick.
When the Commons took into con&s;ideration the e&s;timates
and &s;upplies of the en&s;uing year, the King demanded
forty thou&s;and men for the navy, and above one hundred
thou&s;and for the purpo&s;es of the land-&s;ervice. Before the
Hou&s;e con&s;idered the&s;e enormous demands, they granted
four hundred thou&s;and pounds by way of advance, to
quiet the clamours of the &s;eamen, who were become mu|tinous
and de&s;perate for want of pay, upwards of one
million being due to them for wages. Then the Com|mons
voted the number of men required for the navy:
but they were &s;o a&s;hamed of that for the army, that they
thought it nece&s;&s;ary to act in &s;uch a manner as &s;hould
imply that they &s;till retained &s;ome regard for their country.
They called for all the treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the
King and his allies: they examined the different pro|portions
of the troops furni&s;hed by the re&s;pective powers:
they con&s;idered the intended augmentations, and fixed
the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the year at four&s;core and three thou|&s;and,
<PB N="200" REF="204">
one hundred, and twenty-one men, including
officers. For the maintenance of the&s;e they allotted the
&s;um of two millions, five hundred and thirty-thou&s;and, five
hundred, and ninety pounds. They granted two millions
for the navy, and about five hundred thou&s;and pounds to
make good the deficiencies of the annuity and poll-bills;
&s;o that the &s;upplies for the year amounted to about five-millions
and a half, rai&s;ed by a land-tax of four &s;hillings
in the pound, by two more lives in the annuities, a fur|ther
exci&s;e on beer, a new duty on &s;alt, and a lottery.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. Though the malcontents in parliament
could not with&s;tand this torrent of profu&s;ion, they endea|voured
to di&s;tre&s;s the court-intere&s;t, by reviving the popular
bills of the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion; &s;uch as that for regulating
trials in ca&s;es of high-trea&s;on, the other for the more fre|quent
calling and meeting of parliaments, and that con|cerning
free and impartial proceedings in parliament. The
fir&s;t was neglected in the Hou&s;e of Lords; the &s;econd was
rejected; the third was pa&s;&s;ed by the Commons, on the
&s;uppo&s;ition that it would be defeated in the other Hou&s;e.
The Lords returned it with certain amendments, to which
the Commons would not agree: a conference en&s;ued;
the peers receded from their corrections, and pa&s;&s;ed the
bill, to which the King, however, refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent.
Nothing could be more unpopular and dangerous than
&s;uch a &s;tep at this juncture. The Commons, in order
to recover &s;ome credit with the people, determined to di&s;|approve
of his Maje&s;ty's conduct. The Hou&s;e formed
it&s;elf into a committee, to take the &s;tate of the kingdom
into con&s;ideration. They re&s;olved, that whoever advi&s;ed
the King to refu&s;e the royal a&s;&s;ent to that bill, was an
enemy to their Maje&s;ties and the kingdom. They like|wi&s;e
pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, expre&s;&s;ing their concern that
he had not given his con&s;ent to the bill, and be&s;eeching
his Maje&s;ty to hearken for the future to the advice of his
parliament, rather than to the councils of particular per|&s;ons,
who might have private intere&s;ts of their own,
&s;eparate from tho&s;e of his Maje&s;ty and his people. The
<PB N="201" REF="205">
King thanked them for their zeal, profe&s;&s;ed a warm re|gard
for their con&s;titution, and a&s;&s;ured them he would
look upon all parties as enemies, who &s;hould endeavour
to le&s;&s;en the confidence &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the &s;overeign
and people. The members in the oppo&s;ition were not at
all &s;atisfied with this general reply. A day being ap|pointed
to take it into con&s;ideration, a warm debate was
maintained with equal eloquence and acrimony. At length,
the que&s;tion being put, that an addre&s;s &s;hould be made for
a more explicit an&s;wer, it pa&s;&s;ed in the negative by a
great majority.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. The city of London petitioned that a par|liamentary
provi&s;ion might be made for the orphans, who&s;e
fortunes they had &s;candalou&s;ly &s;quandered away. Such
an application had been made in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion,
and rejected with di&s;dain, as an impo&s;ition on the publick:
but now tho&s;e &s;cruples were removed, and the Hou&s;e
pa&s;&s;ed a bill for this purpo&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of many clau&s;es,
extending to different charges on the city lands, aqueducts,
and per&s;onal e&s;tates; impo&s;ing duties on binding appren|tices,
con&s;tituting freemen, as al&s;o upon wines and coals
imported into London. On the twenty-third day of
March the&s;e bills received the royal a&s;&s;ent; and the King
took that opportunity of recommending di&s;patch, as the
&s;ea&s;on of the year was far advanced, and the enemy dili|gently
employed in making preparations for an early cam|paign.
The &s;cheme of a national bank, like tho&s;e of
Am&s;terdam and Genoa, had been recommended to the
mini&s;try, as an excellent in&s;titution, as well for the credit
and &s;ecurity of the government, as for the increa&s;e of trade
and circulation. One project was invented by Dr. Hugh
Chamberlain, propo&s;ing the circulation of tickets on land-&s;ecurity:
but William Pater&s;on was author of that which
was carried into execution by the intere&s;t of Michael
Godfrey, and other active projectors. The &s;cheme was
founded on the notion of a transferable fund, and a circu|lation
by bill on the credit of a large capital. Forty mer|chants
&s;ub&s;cribed to the amount of five hundred thou&s;and
<PB N="202" REF="206">
pounds, as a fund of ready money, to circulate one million
at eight per cent. to be lent to the government; and even
this fund of ready money bore the &s;ame intere&s;t. When
it was properly dige&s;ted in the cabinet, and a majority in
parliament &s;ecured for its reception, the undertakers for
the court introduced it into the Hou&s;e of Commons, and
expatiated upon the national advantages that would accrue
from &s;uch a mea&s;ure. They &s;aid it would re&s;cue the
nation out of the hands of extortioners and u&s;urers, lower
intere&s;t, rai&s;e the value of land, revive and e&s;tabli&s;h pub|lick
credit, extend circulation, con&s;equently improve
commerce, facilitate the annual &s;upplies, and connect the
people the more clo&s;ely with the government. The
project was violently oppo&s;ed by a &s;trong party, who af|firmed
that it would become a monopoly, and engro&s;s the
whole money of the kingdom: that, as it mu&s;t infallibly
be &s;ub&s;ervient to government-views, it might be employed
to the wor&s;t purpo&s;es of arbitrary power: that, in&s;tead of
a&s;&s;i&s;ting, it would weaken commerce, by tempting people
to withdraw their money from trade, and employ it in
&s;tock-jobbing: that it would produce a &s;warm of brokers
and jobbers to prey upon their fellow-creatures, encourage
fraud and gaming, and further corrupt the morals of the
nation. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e objections, the bill made
its way through the two Hou&s;es, e&s;tabli&s;hing the funds
for the &s;ecurity and advantage of the &s;ub&s;cribers; empow|ering
their Maje&s;ties to incorporate them by the name of
The Governor and Company of the Bank of England,
under a provi&s;o, that at any time after the fir&s;t day of
Augu&s;t, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and five,
upon a year's notice, and the repayment of the twelve
hundred thou&s;and pounds, the &s;aid corporation &s;hould
cea&s;e and determine. The bill likewi&s;e contained clau&s;es
of appropriation for the &s;ervices of the publick. The
whole &s;ub&s;cription was filled in ten days after its being
opened; and the court of directors completed the pay|ment
before the expiration of the time pre&s;cribed by the
act, although they did not call in more than &s;even hun|dred
<PB N="203" REF="207">
and twenty thou&s;and pounds of the money &s;ub|&s;cribed.
All the&s;e funds proving inadequate to the
e&s;timates, the Commons brought in a bill to impo&s;e
&s;tamp duties upon all vellum, parchment, and paper,
u&s;ed in almo&s;t every kind of intercour&s;e between man and
man; and they crowned the oppre&s;&s;ions of the year with
another grievous tax upon carriages, under the name of a
bill for licen&s;ing and regulating hackney and &s;tage-coaches.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. The Commons, in a clau&s;e of the bill for
taxing &s;everal joint-&s;tocks, provided, that in ca&s;e of a
default in the payment of that tax, within the time li|mitted
by the act, the charter of the company &s;o faling
&s;hould be deemed void and forfeited. The Ea&s;t-India
company actually neglected their payment, and the pub|lick
imagined the mini&s;try would &s;ei&s;e this opportunity
of di&s;&s;olving a monopoly again&s;t which &s;o many complaints
had been made: but the directors under&s;tood their own
&s;trength, and, in&s;tead of being broke, obtained the pro|mi&s;e
of a new charter. This was no &s;ooner known, than
the controver&s;y between them and their adver&s;aries was
revived with &s;uch animo&s;ity, that the council thought
proper to indulge both parties with a hearing. As this
produced no re&s;olution, the merchants who oppo&s;ed the
company petitioned, that, in the mean while, the new
charter might be &s;u&s;pended. Addre&s;&s;es of the &s;ame kind
were pre&s;ented by a great number of clothiers, linen|drapers,
and other dealers. To the&s;e a written an&s;wer
was publi&s;hed by the company: the merchants printed a
reply, in which they undertook to prove, that the com|pany
had been guilty of unju&s;t and unwarrantable actions,
tending to the &s;candal of religion, the di&s;honour of the
nation, the reproach of our laws, the oppre&s;&s;ion of the
people, and the ruin of the trade. They ob&s;erved, that
two private &s;hips had exported in one year three times as
many cloths as the company had exported in three years.
They offered to &s;end more cloth and Engli&s;h merchandi&s;e
to the Indies in one year, than the company had exported
<PB N="204" REF="208">
in five; to furni&s;h the government with five hundred tons
of &s;alt-petre for le&s;s than one half of the u&s;ual price; and
they repre&s;ented, that the company could neither load the
&s;hips they petitioned for in England, nor reload them in
the Ea&s;t-Indies. In &s;pite of all the&s;e remon&s;trances, the
new charter pa&s;&s;ed the great &s;eal; though the grants con|tained
in it were limited in &s;uch a manner, that they did
not amount to an exclu&s;ive privilege, and &s;ubjected the
company to &s;uch alterations, re&s;trictions, and qualifica|tions,
as the King &s;hould direct before the twenty-ninth
day of September. This indulgence, and other favours
granted to the company, were privately purcha&s;ed of the
mini&s;try, and became productive of a loud outcry again&s;t
the government. The merchants publi&s;hed a journal of
the whole tran&s;action, and petitioned the Hou&s;e of Com|mons
that their liberty of trading to the Ea&s;t-Indies might
be confirmed by parliament. Another petition was pre|&s;ented
by the company, praying that their charter might
receive a parliamentary &s;anction. Both parties employed
all their addre&s;s in making private application to the
members. The Hou&s;e having examined the differen$
charters, the book of their new &s;ub&s;criptions, and every
particular relating to the company, re&s;olved that all the
&s;ubjects of England had an equal right to trade to the Ea&s;t-Indies,
unle&s;s prohibited by act of parliament.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. But nothing engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the
publick more than a bill which was brought into the
Hou&s;e for a general naturalization of all foreign prote&s;tants&punc;
The advocates for this mea&s;ure alledged, That great par$
of the lands of England lay uncultivated: That the
&s;trength of a nation con&s;i&s;ted in the number of inhabi|tants:
That the people were thinned by the war and
foreign voyages, and required an extraordinary &s;upply&punc;
That great number of prote&s;tants, per&s;ecuted in France
and other countries, would gladly remove to a land o$
freedom, and bring along with them their wealth and ma|nufactures:
That the community had been largely re+paid
for the protection granted to tho&s;e refugees who had
<PB N="205" REF="209">
already &s;ettled in the kingdom. They had introduced
&s;everal new branches of manufacture, promoted indu&s;try,
and lowered the price of labour; a circum&s;tance of the
utmo&s;t importance to trade, oppre&s;&s;ed as it was with taxes,
and expo&s;ed to uncommon hazard from the enemy. The
opponents of the bill urged with great vehemence, That
it would cheapen the birthright of Engli&s;hmen: That
the want of culture was owing to the oppre&s;&s;ion of the
times: That foreigners being admitted into the privileges
of the Briti&s;h trade, would grow wealthy at the expen&s;e of
their benefactors, and transfer the fortunes they had
gained into their native country: That the reduction in
the price of labour would be a national grievance, while
many thou&s;ands of Engli&s;h manufacturers were &s;tarving
for want of employment, and the price of provi&s;ions con|tinued
&s;o high, that even tho&s;e who were employed could
&s;carce &s;upply their families with bread: That the real
de&s;ign of the bill was to make &s;uch an acce&s;&s;ion to the
di&s;&s;enters as would render them an equal match in the
body-politic for tho&s;e of the church of England; to create
a greater dependence on the crown, and, in a word, to
&s;upply a foreign head with foreign members. Sir John
Knight, a member of the Hou&s;e, in a &s;peech upon this
&s;ubject, exaggerated the bad con&s;equences that would
attend &s;uch a bill, with all the wit and virulence of &s;atire:
it was printed and di&s;per&s;ed through the kingdom, and
rai&s;ed &s;uch a flame among the people as had not appeared
&s;ince the Revolution. They exclaimed, that all offices
would be conferred upon Dutchmen, who would become
Lord-danes, and pre&s;cribe the modes of religion and
government; and they extolled Sir John Knight as the
&s;aviour of the nation. The courtiers, incen&s;ed at the
progre&s;s of this clamour, complained in the Hou&s;e of the
&s;peech which had been printed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Feuquieres. Life of King William. Tindal. State Tracts. Ralph. Voltaire.</NOTE> and Sir John was
threatened with expul&s;ion and impri&s;onment. He, there|fore,
thought proper to di&s;own the paper, which was
burned by the hands of the common hangman. This
&s;acrifice &s;erved only to increa&s;e the popular di&s;turbance,
<PB N="206" REF="210">
which ro&s;e to &s;uch a height of violence, that the court-party
began to tremble; and the bill was dropped for the
pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. Lord Coning&s;by and Mr. Porter had com|mitted
the mo&s;t flagrant acts of oppre&s;&s;ion in Ireland.
The&s;e had been explained during the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, by the
gentlemen who appealed again&s;t the admini&s;tration of
Lord Sidney: but they were &s;creened by the mini&s;try;
and, therefore, the Earl of Bellamont now impeached
them in the Hou&s;e of Commons, of which he and they
were members. After an examination of the articles ex|hibited
again&s;t them, the Commons, who were by this
time at the devotion of the court, declared, that, con&s;i|dering
the &s;tate of affairs in Ireland, they did not think
them fit grounds for an impeachment.&mdash;In the cour&s;e of
this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the nation &s;u&s;tained another misfortune in the
fate of Sir Francis Wheeler, who had been appointed
commander in chief of the Mediterranean &s;quadron. He
received in&s;tructions to take under his convoy the merchant+&s;hips
bound to Turkey, Spain, and Italy; to crui&s;e
thirty days in a certain latitude, for the protection of the
Spani&s;h plate-fleet homeward bound; to leave part of his
&s;quadron at Cadix, as convoy to the trade for England
to proceed with the re&s;t to the Mediterranean; to join the
Spani&s;h fleet in his return, and to act in concert with
them, until he &s;hould be joined by the fleet from Turkey
and the Straits, and accompany them back to England&punc;
About the latter end of October he &s;et &s;ail from St&punc;
Helen's, and in January arrived at Cadix with the &s;hip
under his convoy. There leaving Rear-Admiral Hop&s;or
he proceeded for the Mediterranean. In the bay of $$braltar
he was overtaken by a dreadful tempe&s;t, under
lee-&s;hore, which he could not po&s;&s;ibly weather, and whe$
the ground was &s;o foul that no anchor would hold. Th$
expedient, however, was tried. A great number of &s;hip
were driven a&s;hore, and many peri&s;hed. The Admiral+&s;hip
foundered at &s;ea, and he and all his crew were burit
in the deep, except two Moors, who were miraculou&s;
<PB N="207" REF="211">
pre&s;erved. Two other &s;hips of the line, three ketches,
and &s;ix merchant &s;hips, were lo&s;t. The remains of the
fleet were &s;o much &s;hattered, that, in&s;tead of pro&s;ecuting
their voyage, they returned to Cadix, in order to be re|fitted,
and &s;heltered from the attempts of the French
&s;quadrons, which were &s;till at &s;ea, under the command
of Chateau-Renaud and Gabaret. On the twenty-fifth
day of April the King clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech in
the u&s;ual &s;tile, and the parliament was prorogued to the
eighteenth day of September<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Be&s;ides the bills already mentioned, the parliament in this &s;e&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed an act for taking and &s;tating the publick accounts&mdash;another to encourage &s;hip building&mdash;a third for the better di&s;ciplining the navy&mdash;the u&s;ual militia act&mdash;and an act enabling his Maje&s;ty to make grants and lea&s;es in the duchy of Cornwall. One was al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed for renewing a clau&s;e in an old &s;tatute, limiting the number of ju&s;tices of the peace in the principality of Wales. The Duke of Norfolk brought an action into the court of King's-Bench again&s;t Mr. Germaine, for criminal conver&s;ation with his Duche&s;s. The cau&s;e was tried, and the jury brought in their verdict for one hundred marks, and co&s;ts of &s;uit, in favour of the plaintiff.</P>
<P>Before the King embarked, he gratified a good number of his friends with promotions. Lord Charles Butler, brother to the Duke of Ormond, was created Lord Butler, of We&s;ton in England, and Earl of Arran in Ire|$and. The Earl of Shrew&s;bury was honoured with the title of duke. The Earl of Mulgrave, being reconciled to the court-mea&s;ures, was gratified with $word$ pen&s;ion of three thou&s;and pounds, and the title of Marquis of Normanby. Henry Herbert was e$nobled by the title of Baron Herbert, of Cherbury. The Earls of Bedford, Devon&s;hire, and Clare were promoted to the rank of $ukes. The Marquis of Caermarthen was made Duke of Leeds, Lord Vi&s;count Sidney, created Earl of Romney, and Vi&s;count Newport, Earl of $edford. Ru&s;&s;el was advanced to the head of the Admiralty-board. Sir George Rooke and Sir John Houblon were appointed joint commi&s;&s;ioners, in $he room of Killegrew and Delaval. Charles Montagu was made Chan|$ellor of the Exchequer; and Sir William Trumbal and John Smith com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury, in the room of Sir Edward Seymour and Mr. $ambden.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. Louis of France being tired of the war,
which had impoveri&s;hed his country, continued to tamper
with the Duke of Savoy, and, by the canal of the Pope,
made &s;ome offers to the King of Spain, which were re|jected.
Mean while he re&s;olved to &s;tand upon the de|fen&s;ive
during the en&s;uing campaign, in every part but
Catalonia, where his whole naval force might co-operate
<PB N="208" REF="212">
with the Count de Noailles, who commanded the land-army.
King William having received intelligence of the
de&s;ign upon Barcelona, endeavoured to prevent the
junction of the Bre&s;t and Toulon &s;quadrons, by &s;ending
Ru&s;&s;el to &s;ea as early as the fleet could be in a condition
to &s;ail: but, before he arrived at Port&s;mouth, the Bre&s;t
&s;quadron had quitted that harbour. On the third day of
May the Admiral &s;ailed from St. Helen's, with the com|bined
&s;quadrons of England and Holland, amounting to
ninety &s;hips of the line, be&s;ides frigates, fire-&s;hips, and
tenders. He detached Captain Pritchard of the Mon|mouth
with two fire-&s;hips, to de&s;troy a fleet of French
merchant-&s;hips near Conquet-bay; and this &s;ervice being
performed, he returned to St. Helen's, where he had left
Sir Cloude&s;&s;ey Shovel with a &s;quadron, to take on board
a body of land-forces, intended for a de&s;cent upon the
coa&s;t of France. The&s;e being embarked, under the com|mand
of General Ptolemache, the whole fleet &s;ailed again
on the twenty-ninth of May. The land and &s;ea-officers,
in a council of war, agreed that part of the fleet de&s;igned
for this expedition, &s;hould &s;eparate from the re&s;t, and pro|ceed
to Camaret bay, where the forces &s;hould be landed.
On the fifth day of June, Lord Berkeley, who com|manded
this &s;quadron, parted with the grand fleet, and on
the &s;eventh anchored between the bays of Camaret and
Bertaume. Next day the Marquis of Caermarthen, after|wards
Duke of Leeds, who &s;erved under Berkeley, as rear-admiral
of the blue, entered Camaret bay with two large
&s;hips and &s;ix frigates, to cover the troops in landing. The
French had received intelligence of the de&s;ign, and taken
&s;uch precautions, under the conduct of the celebrated
engineer, Vauban, that the Engli&s;h were expo&s;ed to a
terrible fire from new-erected batteries, as well as from
a &s;trong body of troops; and though the &s;hips canno|naded
them with great vigour, the &s;oldiers could not main|tain
any regularity in landing. A good number were
killed in the open boats before they reached the &s;hore; and
tho&s;e who landed were &s;oon repul&s;ed, in &s;pite of all the
<PB N="209" REF="213">
endeavours of General Ptolemache,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. IV. 1694.</NOTE> who received a wound
in the thigh, which proved mortal. Seven hundred &s;ol|diers
are &s;aid to have been lo&s;t on this occa&s;ion, be&s;ides
tho&s;e who were killed on board of the &s;hips. The Monk
&s;hip of war was towed off with great difficulty: but a
Dutch frigate of thirty guns fell into the hands of the
enemy.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. After this unfortunate attempt, Lord Berkeley,
with the advice of a council of war, &s;ailed back for Eng|land,
and at St. Helen's received orders from the Queen
to call a council, and deliberate in what manner the &s;hips
and forces might be be&s;t employed. They agreed to
make &s;ome attempt upon the coa&s;t of Normandy. With
this view they &s;et &s;ail on the fifth day of July. They
bombarded Dieppe, and reduced the greate&s;t part of the
town to a&s;hes. Thence they &s;teered to Havre-de-Grace,
which met with the &s;ame fate. They harra&s;&s;ed the French
troops, who marched after them along-&s;hore. They alarm|ed
the whole coa&s;t, and filled every town with &s;uch con|&s;ternation,
that they would have been abandoned by the
inhabitants, had not they been detained by military force.
On the twenty-&s;ixth day of July, Lord Berkeley returned
to St. Helen's, where he quitted the fleet, and the com|mand
devolved upon Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel. This officer
having received in&s;tructions to make an attempt upon
Dunkirk, &s;ailed round to the Downs, where he was joined
by M. Mee&s;ters, with &s;ix-and-twenty Dutch pilots. On
the twelfth of September he appeared before Dunkirk;
and next day &s;ent in the Charles galley, with two bomb-ketches,
and as many of the machines called Infernals.
The&s;e were &s;et on &s;ire without effect; and the de&s;ign mi&s;|carried:
then Shovel &s;teered for Calais, which having
bombarded with little &s;ucce&s;s, he returned to the coa&s;t of
England; and the bomb-ketches and machinee were &s;ent
into the river Thames.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Admiral Ru&s;&s;el, with
the grand fleet, &s;ailed for the Mediterranean; and being
joined by Rear-Admiral Neville from Cadiz, together
<PB N="210" REF="214">
with Callembergh and Evertzen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1694.</NOTE> he &s;teered towards Bar|celona,
which was be&s;ieged by the French fleet and army.
At his approach Tourville retired with precipitation into
the harbour of Toulon; and Noailles abandoned his en|terpri&s;e.
The Spani&s;h affairs were in &s;uch a deplorable
condition, that without this timely a&s;&s;i&s;tance the kingdom
mu&s;t have been undone. While he continued in the Me|diterranean,
the French Admiral dur&s;t not venture to
appear at &s;ea; and all his projects were di&s;concerted. Af|ter
having a&s;&s;erted the honour of the Briti&s;h flag in tho&s;e
&s;eas during the whole &s;ummer, he sailed in the beginning
of November to Cadix, where, by an expre&s;s order of the
King, he pa&s;&s;ed the winter, during which, he took &s;uch
precautions for preventing Tourville from pa&s;&s;ing the
Straits, that he did not think proper to ri&s;que the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. It will now be nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe the ope|rations
on the continent. In the middle of May King
William arrived in Holland, where he con&s;ulted with the
States-General. On the third day of June he repaired to
Bethlem-abbey near Louvain, the place appointed for
the rendezvous of the army: and there he was met by
the Electors of Bavaria and Cologn. In a few days, a
numerous army was a&s;&s;embled; and every thing &s;eemed
to promi&s;e an active campaign. On the third day of June
the Dauphin a&s;&s;umed the command of the French for|ces,
with which Luxembourg had taken po&s;t between
Mons and Maubeuge; and pa&s;&s;ing the Sambre, encamped
at Fleurus: but, on the eighteenth, he removed from
thence, and took up his quarters between St. Tron and
Wanheim; while the confederates lay at Roo&s;beck. On
the eleventh of July, the Dauphin marched in four co|lumns
to Oerle upon the Jarr, where he pitched his
camp. On the twenty-&s;econd, the confederates marched
to Bomale: then the Dauphin took the route to Vigna|mont,
where he &s;ecured his army by entrenchments, as
his forces were inferior in number to tho&s;e of the allies;
and he had been directed by his father to avoid an engage|ment.
In this &s;ituation both armies remained till the
<PB N="211" REF="215">
fifteenth day of Augu&s;t, when King William &s;ent the
heavy baggage to Louvain; and on the eighteenth made
a motion to Sombref. This was no &s;ooner known to the
enemy, than they decamped; and having marched all
night, po&s;ted them&s;elves between Temploux and Ma&s;y,
within a mile and a half of the confederates. The King of
England re&s;olved to pa&s;s the Scheld; and with this view
marched, by the way of Nivelle and Soignies, to Chievres:
from thence he detached the Duke of Wirtemberg,
with a &s;trong body of hor&s;e and foot, to pa&s;s the river at
Oudenarde, while the Elector of Bavaria advanced with
another detachment, to pa&s;s it at Pont d'E&s;pieres. Not|with&s;tanding
all the expedition they could make, their
purpo&s;e was anticipated by Luxembourg, who being ap|pri&s;ed
of their route, had detached four thou&s;and hor&s;e,
with each a foot &s;oldier behind the trooper, to re-enforce
M. de Valette, who commanded that part of the French
line. The&s;e were &s;u&s;tained by a choice body of men, who
travelled with great expedition, without ob&s;erving the for|malities
of a march. Mare&s;chal de Villeroy followed the
&s;ame route, with all the cavalry of the right wing, the
hou&s;hold troops, and twenty field-pieces; and the re&s;t
of the army was brought up by the Dauphin in per&s;on.
They marched with &s;uch incredible diligence, that the
Elector of Bavaria could &s;carce believe his own eyes,
when he arrived in &s;ight of the Scheld, and &s;aw them en|trenching
them&s;elves on the other &s;ide of the river. King
William having reconnoitered their di&s;po&s;ition, thought it
impracticable to pa&s;s at that place, and therefore marched
down the river to Oudenarde, where a pa&s;&s;age had been
already effected by the Duke of Wirtemberg. Here the
confederates pa&s;&s;ed the Scheld on the twenty-&s;eventh day
of the month; and the King fixed his head-quarters at
Wanneghem. His intention was to have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Courtray, and e&s;tabli&s;h winter-quarters for a con&s;ide|rable
part of his army in that di&s;trict: but, Luxembourg
having po&s;ted him&s;elf between that place and Menin, ex|tended
his lines in &s;uch a manner, that the confederates
<PB N="212" REF="216">
could not attempt to force them, nor even hinder him
from &s;ub&s;i&s;ting his army at the expen&s;e of the Ca&s;tellany
of Courtray, during the remainder of the campaign. This
&s;urpri&s;ing march was of &s;uch importance to the French
King, that he wrote with his own hand a letter of thanks
to his army; and ordered that it &s;hould be read to every
particular &s;quadron and battalion.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. The King of England, though di&s;appointed
in his &s;cheme upon Courtray, found means to make &s;ome
advantage of his &s;uperiority in number. He drafted troops
from the garri&s;ons of Liege and Mae&s;tricht; and on the
third day of September re-enforced this body with a large
detachment from his own camp, conferring the command
upon the Duke of Hol&s;tein-Ploen, with orders to under|take
the &s;iege of Huy. Next day, the whole confederate
forces pa&s;&s;ed the Lys, and encamped at Wouterghen.
From thence the King, with part of the army, marched
to Ro&s;elaer: this divi&s;ion obliged the Dauphin to make
con&s;iderable detachments, for the &s;ecurity of Ypres
and Menin on one &s;ide, and to cover Furnes and Dunkirk
on the other. At this juncture, a Frenchman being &s;eized
in the very act of &s;etting &s;ire to one of the ammunition-waggons
in the allied army, confe&s;&s;ed he had been em|ployed
for this purpo&s;e by &s;ome of the French generals,
and &s;uffered death as a traitor. On the &s;ixteenth day of
the month, the Duke of Hol&s;tein-Ploen inve&s;ted Huy,
and carried on the &s;iege with &s;uch vigour, that in ten days
the garri&s;on capitulated. The King ordered Dixmuyde,
Deyn&s;e, Ninove, and Tirlemont, to be &s;ecured for winter|quarters
to part of the army: the Dauphin returned to
Ver&s;ailles; William quitted the camp on the la&s;t day of
September; and both armies broke up about the middle
of October.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. The operations on the Rhine were precon|certed
between King William and the Prince of Baden,
who had vi&s;ited London in the winter. The di&s;pute be|tween
the Emperor and the Elector of Saxony was com|promi&s;ed;
and this young prince dying during the negoci|ation,
<PB N="213" REF="217">
the treaty was perfected by his brother and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or,
who engaged to furni&s;h twelve thou&s;and men yearly,
in con&s;ideration of a &s;ub&s;idy from the court of Vienna.
In the beginning of June, Mare&s;chal de Lorges pa&s;&s;ed the
Rhine at Philip&s;burgh, in order to give battle to the Im|periali&s;ts,
encamped at Hailbron. The Prince of Baden,
who was not yet joined by the Saxons, He&s;&s;ians, nor by
the troops of Mun&s;ter and Paderborn, di&s;patched couriers
to quicken the march of the&s;e auxiliaries, and advanced to
Eppingen, where he propo&s;ed to wait till they &s;hould come
up: but, on the fifteenth, receiving undoubted intelli|gence,
that the enemy were in motion towards him, he
advanced to meet them in order of battle. De Lorges
concluded that this was a de&s;perate effort, and immedi|ately
halted, to make the nece&s;&s;ary preparations for an en|gagement.
This pau&s;e enabled Prince Louis to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of a &s;trong pa&s;s near Sintzheim, from which he
could not ea&s;ily be di&s;lodged. Then the Mare&s;chal pro|ceeded
to Vi&s;eloch, and ravaged the adjacent country, in
hopes of drawing the Imperiali&s;ts from their entrench|ments.
The Prince being joined by the He&s;&s;ians, re&s;olved
to beat up the quarters of the enemy; and the French
general being appri&s;ed of his de&s;ign, retreated at midnight
with the utmo&s;t precipitation. Having po&s;ted him&s;elf at
Ruth, he &s;ent his heavy baggage to Philip&s;burgh: then he
moved to Gon&s;bergh, in the neighbourhood of Manheim,
repa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, and encamped between Spires and
Worms. The Prince of Baden being joined by the
allies, pa&s;&s;ed the river by a bridge of boats near Hagen|bach,
in the middle of September; and laid the country
of Al&s;ace under contribution. Con&s;idering the advanced
&s;ea&s;on of the year, this was a ra&s;h undertaking; and the
French general re&s;olved to profit by his enemy's temerity.
He forthwith advanced again&s;t the Imperiali&s;ts, fore&s;eeing
that &s;hould they be wor&s;ted in battle, their whole army
would be ruined. Prince Louis, informed of his intention,
immediately repa&s;&s;ed the Rhine; and this retreat was no
&s;ooner effected, than the river &s;welled to &s;uch a degree,
<PB N="214" REF="218">
that the i&s;land in the middle, and great part of the camp
he had occupied, was overflowed. Soon after this inci|dent,
both armies retired into winter-quarters. The cam|paign
in Hungary produced no event of importance. It
was opened by the new Vi&s;ir, who arrived at Belgrade in
the middle of Augu&s;t: and about the &s;ame time Caprara
a&s;&s;embled the Imperial army in the neighbourhood of
Peterwaradin. The Turks pa&s;&s;ed the Saave, in order to
attack their camp, and carried on their approaches with
five hundred pieces of cannon; but made very little pro|gre&s;s.
The Imperiali&s;ts received re-enforcements; the
&s;ea&s;on wa&s;ted away; a feud aro&s;e between the Vi&s;ir and
the Cham of the Tartars; and the Danube being &s;welled
by heavy rains, &s;o as to interrupt the operations of the
Turks, their general decamped in the night of the fir&s;t of
October. They afterwards made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt
upon Titul, while the Imperial general made him&s;elf
ma&s;ter of Giula. In the cour&s;e of this &s;ummer, the Ve|netians,
who were al&s;o at war with the Turks, reduced
Cyclut, a place of importance on the river Naranta, and
made a conque&s;t of the i&s;land of Scio in the Archipelago.</P>
<P>&sect; XLV. We have already ob&s;erved, that the French
King had determined to act vigorou&s;ly in Catalonia. In
the beginning of May, the Duke de Noailles advanced at
the head of eight-and-twenty thou&s;and men to the river
Ter, on the oppo&s;ite bank of which the viceroy of Cata|lonia
was encamped with &s;ixteen thou&s;and Spaniards. The
French general pa&s;&s;ed the river in the face of this army,
and attacked their entrenchments with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity,
that in le&s;s than an hour they were totally defeated.
Then he marched to Palamos, and undertook the &s;iege of
that place, while at the &s;ame time it was blocked up by
the combined &s;quadrons of Bre&s;t and Toulon. Though
the be&s;ieged made an ob&s;tinate defence, the town was
taken by &s;torm, the hou&s;es were pillaged, and the people

Then he inve&s;ted Gironne, which in a few days
capitulated. O&s;talric met with the &s;ame fate, and Noailles

was created viceroy of Catalonia by the French King. In
the beginning of Augu&s;t he di&s;tributed his forces into
quarters of refre&s;hment, along the river Terdore, re&s;olv|ing
to undertake the &s;iege of Barcelona, which was &s;aved
by the arrival of Admiral Ru&s;&s;el. The war langui&s;hed in
Piedmont, on account of a &s;ecret negociation between the
King of France and the Duke of Savoy: notwith&s;tand|ing
the remon&s;trances of Rouvigny, Earl of Galway, who
had &s;ucceeded the Duke of Schomberg in the command of
the Briti&s;h forces in that country. Ca&s;al was clo&s;ely
blocked up by the reduction of Fort St. George, and the
Vaudois gained the advantage in &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes in the
valley of Ragelas: but no de&s;ign of importance was exe|cuted<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the cour&s;e of this year, M. du Ca&s;&s;e, governor of St. Domingo, made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt upon the i&s;land of Jamaica; and M.

<P>&sect; XLVI. England had continued very quiet under the
Queen's admini&s;tration, if we except &s;ome little commo|tions
occa&s;ioned by the practices, or pretended practices,
of the Jacobites. Pro&s;ecutions were revived again&s;t cer|tain
gentlemen of Lanca&s;hire and Che&s;hire, for having
been concerned in the con&s;piracy formed in favour of the
late King's projected inva&s;ion from Normandy. The&s;e
&s;teps were owing to the &s;ugge&s;tions of infamous informers,
whom the mini&s;try countenanced. Colonel Parker and
one Cro&s;by were impri&s;oned, and bills of trea&s;on found
again&s;t them: but Parker made his e&s;cape from the
Tower, and was never retaken, though a reward of four
hundred pounds was &s;et upon his head. The King,
having &s;ettled the affairs of the confederacy at the Hague,
embarked for England on the eighth of November, and
next day landed at Margate. On the twelfth he opened
the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, with a &s;peech, in which he ob|&s;erved
that the po&s;ture of affairs was improved both by
&s;ea and land &s;ince they la&s;t parted; in particular, that a
&s;top was put to the progre&s;s of the French arms. He
<PB N="216" REF="220">
de&s;ired they would continue the act of tonnage and
poundage, which would expire at Chri&s;tmas: he re|minded
them of the debt for the tran&s;port &s;hips employed
in the reduction of Ireland; and exhorted them to prepare
&s;ome good bill for the encouragement of &s;eamen. A ma|jority
in both Hou&s;es was already &s;ecured; and in all pro|bability,
he bargained for their conde&s;cen&s;ion, by agreeing
to the bill for triennial parliaments. This Mr. Harley
brought in, by order of the Lower Hou&s;e, immediately
after their fir&s;t adjournment; and it kept pace with the
con&s;ideration of the &s;upplies. The Commons having
examined the e&s;timates and accounts, voted four millions,
&s;even hundred &s;ixty-four thou&s;and, &s;even hundred and
twelve pounds for the &s;ervice of the army and navy. In
order to rai&s;e this &s;um, they continued the land-tax; they
renewed the &s;ub&s;idy of tonnage and poundage for five
years, and impo&s;ed new duties on different commodities<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">They impo&s;ed certain rates and duties upon marriages, births, and burials, bachelors, and widows. They pa&s;&s;ed an act for laying additional duties upon coffee, tea, and chocolate, towards paying the debt due for the tran&s;port &s;hips; and another, impo&s;ing duties on gla&s;s-wares, &s;tone, and earthen bottles, coal, and culm.</NOTE>.
The triennial bill enacted, That a parliament &s;hould be
held once in three years at lea&s;t: That within three years
at farthe&s;t after the di&s;&s;olution of the parliament then
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and &s;o from time to time, for ever after, legal
writs under the great &s;eal &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued, by the direction
of the crown, for calling, a&s;&s;embling, and holding
another new parliament: That no parliament &s;hould
continue longer than three years at farthe&s;t, to be ac|counted
from the fir&s;t day of the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion: and, That
the parliament then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting &s;hould cea&s;e and determine
on the fir&s;t day of November next following, unle&s;s their
Maje&s;ties &s;hould think fit to di&s;&s;olve it &s;ooner. The Duke
of Devon&s;hire, the Marquis of Hallifax, the Earls of
Weymouth and Ayle&s;bury, prote&s;ted again&s;t this bill,
becau&s;e it tended to the continuance of the pre&s;ent parlia|ment
longer than, as they apprehended, was agreeable to
the con&s;titution of England.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="221">
&sect; XLVII. While this bill was depending, Dr. John
Tillot&s;on, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, was &s;ei&s;ed with a
fit of the dead pal&s;y, in the chapel of Whitehall, and
died on the twenty-&s;econd day of November, deeply re|gretted
by the King and Queen, who &s;hed tears of &s;orrow
at his decea&s;e; and &s;incerely lamented by the publick, as a
pattern of elegance, ingenuity, meekne&s;s, charity, and
moderation. The&s;e qualities he mu&s;t be allowed to have
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding the invectives of his enemies,
who accu&s;ed him of puritani&s;m, flattery, and ambition;
and charged him with having conduced to a dangerous
&s;chi&s;m in the church, by accepting the Archbi&s;hoprick
during the life of the deprived Sancroft. He was &s;uc|ceeded
in the metropolitan &s;ee by Dr. Teni&s;on, Bi&s;hop of
Lincoln, recommended by the Whig-party, which now
predominated in the cabinet. The Queen did not long
&s;urvive her favourite prelate. In about a month after his
decea&s;e, &s;he was taken ill of the &s;mall-pox, and the
&s;ymptoms proving dangerous, &s;he prepared her&s;elf for
death with great compo&s;ure. She &s;pent &s;ome time in exer|ci&s;es
of devotion, and private conver&s;ation with the new
Archbi&s;hop: &s;he received the &s;acrament with all the
Bi&s;hops who were in attendance; and expired on the
twenty-eighth day of December, in the thirty-third year
of her age, and in the &s;ixth of her reign, to the inex|pre&s;&s;ible
grief of the King, who for &s;ome weeks after her
death could neither &s;ee company, nor attend to the bu&s;i|ne&s;s
of &s;tate. Mary was in her per&s;on tall and well-pro|portioned,
with an oval vi&s;age, lively eyes, agreeable
features, a mild a&s;pect, and an air of dignity. Her ap|prehen&s;ion
was clear, her memory tenacious, and her
$udgement &s;olid. She was a zealous prote&s;tant, &s;crupu|lou&s;ly
exact in all the duties of devotion, of an even
temper, and of a calm and mild conver&s;ation. She was
$u&s;&s;led by no pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;eems to have been a &s;tranger
$o the emotions of natural affection; for &s;he a&s;cended,
without compunction, the throne from which her father
had been depo&s;ed, and treated her &s;i&s;ter as an alien to her
<PB N="218" REF="222">
blood. In a word, Mary &s;eems to have imbibed the cold
di&s;po&s;ition and apathy of her hu&s;band; and to have cen|tered
all her ambition in de&s;erving the epithet of an hum|ble
and obedient wife<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Her ob&s;equies were performed with great magnificence. The body was attended from Whitehall to We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey by all the Judges, Ser|jeants at Law, the Lord Mayor, and Aldermen of the city of London, and both Hou&s;es of Parliament; and the funeral &s;ermon was preached by Dr. Teni&s;on, Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. Dr. Kenn, the deprived Bi&s;hop of Bath and Wells, reproached him in a letter, for not having called upon her Maje&s;ty on her death-bed to repent of the &s;hare &s;he had in the Revo|lution. This was an&s;wered by another pamphlet. One of the Jacobite clergy in&s;ulted the Queen's memory, by preaching on the following text, &startq;Go, now, &s;ee this cur&s;ed woman, and bury her, for &s;he is a King's daughter.&endq; On the other hand, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Com|mon Council of London came to a re&s;olution to erect her &s;tatue, with that of the King, in the Royal-Exchange.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVIII. The Prince&s;s Anne being informed of the
Queen's dangerous indi&s;po&s;ition, &s;ent a lady of her bed|chamber,
to de&s;ire &s;he might be admitted to her Maje&s;ty;
but this reque&s;t was not granted. She was thanked for
her expre&s;&s;ion of concern; and given to under&s;tand, that
the phy&s;icians had directed that the queen &s;hould be kept
as quiet as po&s;&s;ible. Before her death, however &s;he &s;ent
a forgiving me&s;&s;age to her &s;i&s;ter; and after her decea&s;e,
the Earl of Sunderland effected a reconciliation between
the King and the Prince&s;s, who vi&s;ited him at Ken&s;ington,
where &s;he was received with uncommon civility. He ap|pointed
the palace of St. James's for her re&s;idence, and
pre&s;ented her with the greater part of the Queen's jewels.
But a mutual jealou&s;y and di&s;gu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;ted under the&s;e
exteriors of friend&s;hip and e&s;teem. The two Hou&s;es of
parliament waited on the King at Ken&s;ington, with con|&s;olatory
addre&s;&s;es on the death of his con&s;ort: their exam|ple
was followed by the regency of Scotland, the city and
clergy of London, the di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters, and almo&s;t all
the great corporations in England<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Earls of Roche&s;ter and Nottingham are &s;aid to have &s;tarted a doubt, Whether the parliament was not di&s;&s;olved by the Queen's death? but this dangerous motion met with no countenance.</NOTE>.</P>

&sect; I. THE kingdom now re&s;ounded with the com|plaints
of the papi&s;ts and malcontents, who
taxed the mini&s;try with &s;ubornation of perjury, in the
ca&s;e of the Lanca&s;hire gentlemen who had been pro&s;ecuted
for the con&s;piracy. One Lunt, an Iri&s;hman, had informed
Sir John Trenchard, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, that he had been
&s;ent from Ireland, with commi&s;&s;ions from King James to
divers gentlemen in Lanca&s;hire and Che&s;hire: that he had
a&s;&s;i&s;ted in buying arms, and enli&s;ting men to &s;erve that king
in his projected inva&s;ion of England: that he had been
twice di&s;patched by tho&s;e gentlemen to the court of St.
Germain's, a&s;&s;i&s;ted many Jacobites in repairing to France,
helped to conceal others that came from that kingdom;
and that all tho&s;e per&s;ons told him they were furni&s;hed
with money by Sir John Friend to defray the expen&s;e
<PB N="221" REF="225">
of their expedition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1694.</NOTE> His te&s;timony was confirmed by
other infamous emi&s;&s;aries, who received but too much
countenance from the government. Blank warrants were
i&s;&s;ued, and filled up occa&s;ionally with &s;uch names as the
informers &s;ugge&s;ted. The&s;e were delivered to Aaron
Smith, &s;ollicitor to the Trea&s;ury, who, with me&s;&s;engers,
accompanied Lunt and his a&s;&s;ociates to Lanca&s;hire, under
the protection of a party of Dutch hor&s;e guards, com|manded
by one Captain Baker. They were empowered
to break open hou&s;es, &s;ei&s;e papers, and apprehend per&s;ons,
according to their plea&s;ure; and they committed many
acts of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion. The per&s;ons again&s;t
whom the&s;e mea&s;ures were taken, being appri&s;ed of the
impending danger, generally retired from their own habi|tations.
Some, however, were taken and impri&s;oned: a
few arms were &s;ecured; and, in the Hou&s;e of Mr. Standi&s;h,
at Standi&s;h-hall, they found the draft of a declaration to
be publi&s;hed by King James at his landing. As this pro|&s;ecution
&s;eemed calculated to revive the honour of a &s;tale
con&s;piracy, and the evidences were per&s;ons of abandoned
characters, the friends of tho&s;e who were per&s;ecuted, found
no great difficulty in rendering the &s;cheme odious to the
nation. They even employed the pen of Fergu&s;on, who
had been concerned in every plot that was hatched &s;ince
the Rye-hou&s;e con&s;piracy. This veteran, though appoint|ed
hou&s;e-keeper to the Exci&s;e-office, thought him&s;elf
poorly recompen&s;ed for the part he had acted in the Revo|lution,
became di&s;&s;atisfied, and, upon this occa&s;ion, pub|li&s;hed
a letter to Sir John Trenchard, on the abu&s;e of
power. It was replete with the mo&s;t bitter invectives
again&s;t the mini&s;try, and contained a great number of
flagrant in&s;tances, in which the court had countenanced
the vile&s;t corruption, perfidy, and oppre&s;&s;ion. This pro|duction
was in every body's hand, and had &s;uch an effect
upon the people, that when the pri&s;oners were brought to
tryal at Manche&s;ter, the populace would have put the
witne&s;&s;es to death, had not they been prevented by the inter|po&s;ition
of tho&s;e who were friends to the accu&s;ed per&s;ons,
<PB N="222" REF="226">
and had already taken effectual mea&s;ures for their &s;afety.
Lunt's chief a&s;&s;ociate in the my&s;tery of information was one
Taaffe, a wretch of the mo&s;t profligate principles, who,
finding him&s;elf di&s;appointed in his hope of reward from the
mini&s;try, was privately gained over by the agents for the
pri&s;oners. Lunt, when de&s;ired in court to point out the
per&s;ons whom he had accu&s;ed, committed &s;uch a mi&s;take
as greatly invalidated his te&s;timony; and Taaffe declared
before the bench, that the pretended plot was no other than
a contrivance between him&s;elf and Lunt, in order to pro|cure
money from the government. The pri&s;oners were
immediately acquitted, and the mini&s;try incurred a heavy
load of popular odium, as the authors or abettors of kna|vi&s;h
contrivances to en&s;nare the innocent. The govern|ment,
with a view to evince their abhorrence of &s;uch
practices, ordered the witne&s;&s;es to be pro&s;ecuted for a con|&s;piracy
again&s;t the lives and e&s;tates of the gentlemen who
had been accu&s;ed; and at la&s;t the affair was brought into
the Hou&s;e of Commons. The Jacobites triumphed in their
victory. They even turned the battery of corruption upon
the evidence for the crown, not without making a con|&s;iderable
impre&s;&s;ion. But the cau&s;e was now debated be|fore
judges who were not all propitious to their views.
The Commons having &s;et on foot an enquiry, and exami|ned
all the papers and circum&s;tances relating to the pre|tended
plot, re&s;olved, That there was &s;ufficient ground
for the pro&s;ecution and tryals of the gentlemen at Man|che&s;ter;
and that there was a dangerous con&s;piracy again&s;t
the King and government. They i&s;&s;ued an order for
taking Mr. Standi&s;h into cu&s;tody; and the me&s;&s;enger re|porting
that he was not to be found, they pre&s;ented an ad|dre&s;s
to the King, de&s;iring a proclamation might be pub|li&s;hed,
offering a reward for apprehending his per&s;on. The
Peers concurred with the Commons in their &s;entiment$ of
this affair; for complaints having been laid before their
Hou&s;e al&s;o, by the per&s;ons who thought them&s;elves aggriev|ed,
the que&s;tion was put, Whether the government had
cau&s;e to pro&s;ecute them? and carried in the affirmative;
<PB N="223" REF="227">
though a prote&s;t was entered again&s;t this vote by the Earls
of Roche&s;ter and Nottingham. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e
deci&s;ions, the accu&s;ed gentlemen pro&s;ecuted Lunt and two
of his accomplices for perjury, at the Lanca&s;ter a&s;&s;i&s;es; and
all three were found guilty. They were immediately in|dicted
by the crown, for a con&s;piracy again&s;t the lives and
liberties of the per&s;ons they had accu&s;ed. The intention
of the mini&s;try, in laying this indictment, was to &s;ei&s;e the
opportunity of puni&s;hing &s;ome of the witne&s;&s;es for the
gentlemen, who had prevaricated in giving their te&s;ti|mony:
but the de&s;ign being di&s;covered, the Lanca&s;hire|men
refu&s;ed to produce their evidence again&s;t the infor|mers:
the pro&s;ecution dropped of con&s;equence; and
the pri&s;oners were di&s;charged.</P>
<P>&sect; II. When the Commons were employed in examining
the &s;tate of the revenue, and taking mea&s;ures for rai&s;ing the
nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, the inhabitants of Roy&s;ton pre&s;ented a
petition, complaining, that the officers and &s;oldiers of the
regiment belonging to Colonel Ha&s;tings, which was quar|tered
upon them, exacted &s;ub&s;i&s;tence money, even on pain
of military execution. The Hou&s;e was immediately kind|led
into a flame by this information. The officers, and
Pauncefort, agent for the regiment, were examined: then
it was unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, That &s;uch a practice was ar|bitrary,
illegal, and a violation of the rights and liberties
of the &s;ubject. Upon further enquiry, Pauncefort and
&s;ome other agents were committed to the cu&s;tody of the
Serjeant, for having neglected to pay the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence-mo|ney
they had received for the officers and &s;oldiers. He was
afterwards &s;ent to the Tower, together with Henry Guy,
a member of the Hou&s;e, and &s;ecretary to the Trea&s;ury,
the one for giving, and the other for receiving, a bribe to
obtain the King's bounty. Pauncefort's brother was like|wi&s;e
committed, for being concerned in the &s;ame com|merce.
Guy had been employed, together with Trevor
the Speaker, as the court-agent for &s;ecuring a majority in
the Hou&s;e of Commons: for that rea&s;on, he was obnoxious
to the members in the oppo&s;ition, who took this oppor|tunity
<PB N="224" REF="228">
to brand him; and the courtiers could not with any
decency &s;kreen him from their vengeance. The Hou&s;e
having proceeded in this enquiry, drew up an addre&s;s to the
King, enumerating the abu&s;es which had crept into the
army, and demanding immediate redre&s;s. He promi&s;ed to
con&s;ider the remon&s;trance, and redre&s;s the grievances of
which they complained. Accordingly he ca&s;hiered Co|lonel
Ha&s;tings; appointed a council of officers to &s;it week|ly
and examine all complaints again&s;t any officer and &s;ol|dier;
and publi&s;hed a declaration for the maintenance
of &s;trict di&s;cipline, and the due payment of quarters.
Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, the Commons pro&s;e|cuted
their examinations: they committed Mr. James
Craggs, one of the contractors for clothing the army,
becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to an&s;wer upon oath &s;uch que&s;tions
as might be put to him by the commi&s;&s;ioners of accounts.
They brought in a bill for obliging him and Mr. Rich|ard
Harnage the other contractor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Boyer. Oldmixon. State Tracts Tindal. Ralph. Lives of the Admirals. Daniel. Voltaire.</NOTE> together with the
two Paunceforts, to di&s;cover how they had di&s;po&s;ed of
the &s;ums paid into their hands on account of the army;
and for puni&s;hing them, in ca&s;e they &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in
their refu&s;al. At this period, they received a petition
again&s;t the commi&s;&s;ioners for licen&s;ing hackney-coaches.
Three of them, by means of an addre&s;s to the King,
were removed with di&s;grace, for having acted arbitrarily,
corruptly, and contrary to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them by
act of parliament.</P>
<P>&sect; III. Tho&s;e who encouraged this &s;pirit of reformation
introduced another enquiry about the orphans bill, which
was &s;aid to have pa&s;&s;ed into an act, by virtue of undue
influence. A committee being appointed to in&s;pect the
Chamberlain's books, di&s;covered that bribes had been
given to Sir John Trevor, Speaker of the Hou&s;e, and Mr.
Hungerford, chairman of the grand committee. The fir&s;t
being voted guilty of a high crime and mi&s;demeanour,
abdicated the chair, and Paul Foley was appointed Speaker
in his room. Then Sir John and Hungerford were ex|pelled
the Hou&s;e: one Nois, a &s;ollicitor for the hill, was
taken into cu&s;tody, becau&s;e he had &s;candali&s;ed the Com|mons,
<PB N="225" REF="229">
in pretending he was engaged to give great &s;ums to
&s;everal members,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1695.</NOTE> and denying this circum&s;tance on his ex|amination.
The reformers in the Hou&s;e naturally con|cluded
that the &s;ame arts had been practi&s;ed in obtaining
the new charter of the Ea&s;t-India company, which had
been granted &s;o much again&s;t the &s;en&s;e of the nation. Their
books were &s;ubjected to the &s;ame committee that carried on
the former enquiry, and a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;cene of venality and
corruption was &s;oon di&s;clo&s;ed. It appeared that the com|pany,
in the cour&s;e of the preceding year, had paid near
ninety thou&s;and pounds in &s;ecret-&s;ervices; and that Sir
Thomas Cooke, one of the directors, and a member of
the Hou&s;e, had been the chief manager of this infamous
commerce. Cooke refu&s;ing to an&s;wer, was committed to
the Tower, and a bill of pains and penalties brought in,
obliging him to di&s;cover how the &s;um mentioned in the
report of the committee had been di&s;tributed. The bill
was violently oppo&s;ed in the Upper Hou&s;e by the Duke of
Leeds, as being contrary to law and equity, and furni&s;hing
a precedent of a dangerous nature. Cooke being, agree|ably
to his own petition, brought to the bar of the Hou&s;e of
Lords, declared that he was ready and willing to make a full
di&s;covery, in ca&s;e he might be favoured with an indemni|fying
vote, to &s;ecure him again&s;t all actions and &s;uits,
except tho&s;e of the Ea&s;t-India company, which he had
never injured. The Lords complied with his reque&s;t,
and pa&s;&s;ed a bill for this purpo&s;e, to which the Commons
added a penal clau&s;e; and the former was laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. When the King went to the Hou&s;e, to give the
royal a&s;&s;ent to the money-bills, he endeavoured to di&s;cou|rage
this enquiry, by telling the parliament that the
&s;ea&s;on of the year was far advanced and the circum&s;tances
of affairs extremely pre&s;&s;ing: he, therefore, de&s;ired they
would di&s;patch &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s as they &s;hould think of mo&s;t
importance to the publick, as he &s;hould put an end to the
&s;e&s;&s;ion in a few days. Notwith&s;tanding this &s;hameful in|terpo&s;ition,
both Hou&s;es appointed a joint committee to
lay open the complicated &s;cheme of fraud and iniquity.
<PB N="226" REF="230">
Cooke, on his fir&s;t examination, confe&s;&s;ed, that he had
delivered tallies for ten thou&s;and pounds to Francis Ty&s;&s;en,
deputy-governour, for the &s;pecial &s;ervice of the company;
an equal &s;um to Richard Acton, for employing his intere&s;t
in preventing a new &s;ettlement, and endeavouring to e&s;ta|bli&s;h
the old company; be&s;ides two thou&s;and pounds by
way of intere&s;t, and as a further gratuity; a thou&s;and
guineas to Colonel Fitzpatrick, five hundred to Charles
Bates, and three hundred and ten to Mr. Molineux, a
merchant, for the &s;ame purpo&s;es; and he owned that Sir
Ba&s;il Firebrace had received forty thou&s;and pounds on
various pretences. He &s;aid, he believed the ten thou&s;and
pounds paid to Ty&s;&s;en had been delivered to the King by
Sir Jo&s;iah Child, as a cu&s;tomary pre&s;ent which former
kings had received; and that the &s;ums paid to Acton were
di&s;tributed among &s;ome members of parliament. Firebrace
being examined, affirmed that he had received the whole
forty thou&s;and pounds for his own u&s;e and benefit; but
that Bates had received &s;ums of money, which he under|&s;tood
were offered to &s;ome per&s;ons of the fir&s;t quality.
Acton declared, that ten thou&s;and pounds of the &s;um
which he had received was di&s;tributed among per&s;ons who
had intere&s;t with members of parliament; and that great
part of the money pa&s;&s;ed through the hands of Craggs,
who was acquainted with &s;ome colonels in the Hou&s;e and
northern members. Bates owned he had received the
money, in con&s;ideration of u&s;ing his intere&s;t with the Duke
of Leeds in favour of the company: that this nobleman
knew of the gratuity; and that the &s;um was reckoned by
his grace's dome&s;tick, one Robart, a foreigner, who kept
it in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion until this enquiry was talked of, and
then it was returned. In a word, it appeared by this man's
te&s;timony, as well as by that of Firebrace on his &s;econd
examination, that the Duke of Leeds was not free from
corruption, and that Sir John Trevor was a hireling
pro&s;titute.</P>
<P>&sect; V. The report of the committee produced violent al|tercation,
and the mo&s;t &s;evere &s;trictures upon the conduct
<PB N="227" REF="231">
of the Lord Pre&s;ident. At length, the Hou&s;e re&s;olved,
That there was &s;ufficient matter to impeach Thomas Duke
of Leeds of high crimes and mi&s;demeanours; and that he
&s;hould be impeached thereupon. Then it was ordered,
That, Mr. Comptroller Wharton &s;hould impeach him
before the Lords, in the name of the Hou&s;e, and of all the
Commons in England. The Duke was actually in the
middle of a &s;peech for his own ju&s;tification, in which he
a&s;&s;ured the Hou&s;e, upon his honour, that he was not guilty
of the corruptions laid to his charge, when one of his friends
gave him intimation of the votes which had pa&s;&s;ed in the
Commons. He concluded his &s;peech abruptly, and re|pairing
to the Lower-Hou&s;e, de&s;ired he might be indulged
with a hearing. He was accordingly admitted, with the
compliment of a chair, and leave to be covered. After
having &s;at a few minutes, he took off his hat, and addre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf to the Commons in very extraordinary terms.
Having thanked them for the favour of indulging him with
a hearing, he &s;aid that Hou&s;e would not have been then
&s;itting but for him. He prote&s;ted his own innocence, with
re&s;pect to the crime laid to his charge. He complained that
this was the effect of a de&s;ign which had been long formed
again&s;t him. He expre&s;&s;ed a deep &s;en&s;e of his being under
the di&s;plea&s;ure of the parliament and nation, and demanded
&s;peedy ju&s;tice. They forthwith drew up the articles of
impeachment, which being exhibited at the bar of the
Upper Hou&s;e, he pleaded not guilty, and the Commons
promi&s;ed to make good their charge: but, by this time,
&s;uch arts had been u&s;ed, as all at once checked the violence
of the pro&s;ecution. Such a number of con&s;iderable per|&s;ons
were involved in this my&s;tery of corruption, that a
full di&s;covery was dreaded by both parties. The Duke
&s;ent his dome&s;tick, Robart, out of the kingdom, and his
ab&s;ence furni&s;hed a pretence for po&s;tponing the tryal. In
a word, the enquiry was dropped; but the &s;candal &s;tuck
fa&s;t to the Duke's character.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e deliberations, the King went
to the Hou&s;e on the third day of May, when he thanked
<PB N="228" REF="232">
parliament for the &s;upplies they had granted; &s;ignifying his
intention of going abroad; a&s;&s;ured them he would place the
admini&s;tration of affairs in per&s;ons of known care and fide|lity;
and de&s;ired that the members of both Hou&s;es would
be more than ordinarily vigilant in pre&s;erving the publick
peace. The parliament was then prorogued to the eigh|teenth
of June.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>In the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion, the Lords had enquired into the particulars of the Mediterranean expedition, and pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the King, de|claring, that the fleet in tho&s;e &s;eas had conduced to the honour and advantage of the nation. On the other hand, the Commons, in an addre&s;s, be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty to take care that the kingdom might be put on an equal footing and proportion with the allies, in defraying the expen&s;e of the war.</P>
<P>The coin of the kingdom being greatly dimini&s;hed and adulterated, the Earls of Roche&s;ter and Nottingham expatiated upon this national evil in the Hou&s;e of Lords; and an act was pa&s;&s;ed, containing &s;everer penalties again&s;t clippers: but this produced no good effect. The value of money &s;unk in the exchange to &s;uch a degree, that a guinea was reckoned adequate to thirty &s;hillings; and this publick di&s;grace lowered the credit of the funds and of the government. The nation was alarmed by the circulation of fictitious wealth, in&s;tead of gold and &s;ilver, &s;uch as bank-bills, Exchequer tallies, and govern|ment &s;ecurities. The malcontents took this opportunity to exclaim again&s;t the Bank, and even attempted to &s;hake the credit of it in parliament: but their endeavours proved abortive: the monied-intere&s;t preponderated in both Hou&s;es.</P></NOTE>. The King immediately appointed a re|gency
to govern the kingdom in his ab&s;ence: but neither
the Prince&s;s of Denmark nor her hu&s;band were entru&s;ted
with any &s;hare in the admini&s;tration; a circum&s;tance
that evinced the King's jealou&s;y, and gave offen&s;e to a
great part of the nation.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The regency was compo&s;ed of the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury; Somers, lord-keeper of the great &s;eal; the Earl of Pembroke, lord-privy-&s;eal; the Duke of Devon&s;hire, lord-&s;leward of the hou&s;ehold; the Duke of Shrews|bury, &s;ecretary of &s;tate; the Earl of Dor&s;et, lord chamberlain; and the Lord Godolphin, fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea&s;ury. Sir John Trenchard dying, his place of &s;ecretary was filled with Sir William Trumb$l, an eminent civil|ian, learned, diligent, and virtuous, who had been envoy at Paris and Con|&s;tantinople. William Na&s;&s;au de Zuyle&s;tein, &s;on of the King's natural uncle, was created Baron of Enfield, Vi&s;count Tunbridge, and Earl of Rochford. Ford, Lord Grey of Worke, was made Vi&s;count Glendale, and Earl of Tan|kerville. The month of April of this year was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the death of the famous George Saville, Marquis of Halli&s;ax, who had &s;urvived in a good mea&s;ure his talents and reputation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="233">
&sect; VII. A &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament was deemed nece&s;&s;ary in
Scotland, to provide new &s;ub&s;idies for the maintenance of
the troops of that kingdom, which had been &s;o &s;erviceable
in the pro&s;ecution of the war. But, as a great outcry
had been rai&s;ed again&s;t the government, on account of the
ma&s;&s;acre of Glencoe, and the Scots were tired of contri|buting
towards the expen&s;e of a war from which they
could derive no advantage, the mini&s;try thought proper to
cajole them with the promi&s;e of &s;ome national indulgence.
In the mean time, a commi&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed the great &s;eal, for
taking a precognition of the ma&s;&s;acre, as a previous &s;tep
to the tryal of the per&s;ons concerned in that perfidious
tran&s;action. On the ninth of May, the &s;e&s;&s;ion was opened
by the Marquis of Tweedale, appointed commi&s;&s;ioner,
who, after the King's letter had been read, expatiated on
his Maje&s;ty's care and concern for their &s;afety and wel|fare;
and his firm purpo&s;e to maintain the pre&s;byterian
di&s;cipline in the church of Scotland. Then he promi&s;ed,
in the King's name, that if they would pa&s;s an act for
e&s;tabli&s;hing a colony in Africa, America, or any other part
of the world where a colony might be lawfully planted,
his Maje&s;ty would indulge them with &s;uch rights and
privileges as he had granted in like ca&s;es to the &s;ubjects of
his other dominions. Finally, he exhorted them to con|&s;ider
ways and means to rai&s;e the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies for
maintaining their land forces, and for providing a compe|tent
number of &s;hips of war to protect their commerce.
The parliament immediately voted an addre&s;s of condo|lance
to his Maje&s;ty on the death of the Queen; and
they granted one hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds
&s;terling for the &s;ervices of the en&s;uing year, to be rai&s;ed
by a general poll-tax, a land-tax, and an additional
exci&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. Their next &s;tep was to de&s;ire the commi&s;&s;ioner
would tran&s;mit their humble thanks to the King, for his
care to vindicate the honour of the government and the
ju&s;tice of the nation, in ordering a precognition to be
taken with re&s;pect to the &s;laughter of Glencoe. A motion
<PB N="230" REF="234">
was afterwards made, that the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould ex|hibit
an account of their proceedings in this affair: ac|cordingly,
a report, con&s;i&s;ting of the King's in&s;tructions,
Dalrymple's letters, the depo&s;itions of witne&s;&s;es, and the
opinion of the committee, was laid before the parliament.
The motion is &s;aid to have been privately influenced by
Secretary John&s;ton, for the di&s;grace of Dalrymple, who
was his rival in power and intere&s;t. The written opinion
of the commi&s;&s;ioners, who were creatures of the court,
imported, That Macdonald of Glencoe had been perfi|diou&s;ly
murthered; that the King's intentions contained
nothing to warrant the ma&s;&s;acre; and that Secretary Dal|rymple
had exceeded his orders. The parliament con|curred
with this report. They re&s;olved, That Living&s;ton
was not to blame, for having given the orders contained
in his letters to Lieut. Col. Hamilton: that this la&s;t was
liable to pro&s;ecution: that the King &s;hould be addre&s;&s;ed
to give orders, either for examining Major Duncan&s;on in
Flanders, touching his concern in this affair, or for &s;end|ing
him home to be tried in Scotland; as al&s;o, that Camp|bel
of Glenlyon, Captain Drummond, Lieutenant Lind|&s;ey,
En&s;ign Lundy, and Serjeant Barber, &s;hould be &s;ent
to Scotland, and pro&s;ecuted according to law, for the parts
they had acted in that execution. In con&s;equence of
the&s;e re&s;olutions, the parliament drew up an addre&s;s to
the King, in which they laid the whole blame of the ma&s;&s;a|cre
upon the exce&s;s in the Ma&s;ter of Stair's letters con|cerning
that tran&s;action. They begged that his Maje&s;ty
would give &s;uch orders about him, as he &s;hould think &s;it
for the vindication of his government; that the actors in
that barbarous &s;laughter might be pro&s;ecuted by the King's
advocate, according to law; and that &s;ome reparation
might be made to the men of Glencoe who e&s;caped the
ma&s;&s;acre, for the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained in their effects
upon that occa&s;ion, as their habitations had been plundered
and burned, their lands wa&s;ted, and their cattle driven
away; &s;o that they were reduced to extreme poverty.
Notwith&s;tanding this addre&s;s of the Scotti&s;h parliament, by
<PB N="231" REF="235">
which the King was &s;o &s;olemnly exculpated, his memory
is &s;till loaded with the &s;u&s;picion of having concerted, coun|tenanced,
and enforced this barbarous execution, e&s;pecially
as the Ma&s;ter of Stair e&s;caped with impunity, and the
other actors of the tragedy, far from being puni&s;hed, were
preferred in the &s;ervice. While the commi&s;&s;ioners were
employed in the enquiry, they made &s;uch di&s;coveries con|cerning
the conduct of the Earl of Breadalbane, as
amounted to a charge of high-trea&s;on; and he was com|mitted
pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle of Edinburgh: but it &s;eems
he had di&s;&s;embled with the Highlanders, by the King's
permi&s;&s;ion, and now &s;heltered him&s;elf under the &s;hadow of
a royal pardon.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. The committee of trade, in pur&s;uance of the
powers granted by the King to his commi&s;&s;ioner, prepared
an act for e&s;tabli&s;hing a company trading to Africa and
the Indies, empowering them to plant colonies, hold cities,
towns, or forts, in places uninhabited, or in others, with
the con&s;ent of the natives; ve&s;ting them with an exclu&s;ive
right, and an exemption for one-and-twenty years from all
duties or impo&s;itions. This act was likewi&s;e confirmed
by letters-patent under the great &s;eal, directed by the par|liament,
without any further warrant from the crown.
Pater&s;on, the projector, had contrived the &s;cheme of a
&s;ettlement upon the I&s;thmus of Darien, in &s;uch a manner
as to carry on a trade in the South-Sea, as well as in the
Atlantick; nay, even to extend it as far as the Ea&s;t-Indies:
a great number of London merchants, allured
by the pro&s;pect of gain, were eager to engage in &s;uch a
company, exempted from all manner of impo&s;ition and re|&s;triction.
The Scotti&s;h parliament likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed an act
in favour of the epi&s;copal clergy, decreeing, That tho&s;e
who &s;hould enter into &s;uch engagements to the King, as
were by law required, might continue in their benefices
under his Maje&s;ty's protection, without being &s;ubject to
the power of pre&s;bytery. Seventy of the mo&s;t noted
mini&s;ters of that per&s;ua&s;ion took the benefit of this indul|gence.
Another law was enacted, for rai&s;ing nine thou&s;and
<PB N="232" REF="236">
men yearly, to recruit the Scotti&s;h regiments abroad; and
an act for erecting a publick bank: then the parliament
was adjourned to the &s;eventh day of November.</P>
<P>&sect; X. Ireland began to be infected with the &s;ame factions
which had broke out in England &s;ince the Revolution.
Lord Capel, the lord-deputy, governed in a very partial
manner, oppre&s;&s;ing the Iri&s;h papi&s;ts, without any re|gard
to equity or decorum. He undertook to model a
parliament in &s;uch a manner, that they &s;hould comply
with all the demands of the mini&s;try; and he &s;ucceeded in
his endeavours, by making &s;uch arbitrary changes in offices
as be&s;t &s;uited his purpo&s;e. The&s;e precautions being taken,
he convoked a parliament for the twenty-&s;eventh day of
Augu&s;t, when he opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;peech, expa|tiating
upon their obligations to King William, and ex|horting
them to make &s;uitable returns to &s;uch a gracious
&s;overeign. He ob&s;erved, that the revenue had &s;allen &s;hort
of the e&s;tabli&s;hment; &s;o that both the civil and military
li&s;ts were greatly in debt: that his Maje&s;ty had &s;ent over
a bill for an additional exci&s;e, and expected they would
find ways and means to an&s;wer the demands of the &s;ervice.
They forthwith voted an addre&s;s of thanks, and re&s;olved
to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty to the utmo&s;t of their power, again&s;t
all his enemies foreign and dome&s;tick. They pa&s;&s;ed the
bill for an additional exci&s;e, together with an act for laking
away the writs &startq;<HI>De heretico comburendo;</HI>&endq; another an|nulling
all attainders and acts pa&s;&s;ed in the late pretended
parliament of King James: a third to prevent foreign
education: a fourth for di&s;arming papi&s;ts: and a fifth for
&s;ettling the e&s;tates of inte&s;tates. Then they re&s;olved,
That a &s;um not exceeding one hundred and &s;ixty-three
thou&s;and, three hundred and twenty-five pounds, &s;hould
be granted to his Maje&s;ty, to be rai&s;ed by a poll-bill, ad|ditional
cu&s;toms, and a continuation of the additional ex|ci&s;e.
Sir Charles Porter, the Chancellor, finding his im|portance
dimini&s;hed, if not entirely de&s;troyed, by the
a&s;&s;uming di&s;po&s;ition and power of the Lord-Deputy, began
to court popularity, by e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of the Iri&s;h,
<PB N="233" REF="237">
again&s;t the &s;everity of the admini&s;tration; and actually
formed a kind of Tory-intere&s;t, which thwarted Lord
Capel in all his mea&s;ures. A motion was made in parlia|ment
to impeach the Chancellor, for &s;owing di&s;cord and
divi&s;ion among his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects: but, being in|dulged
with a hearing by the Hou&s;e of Commons, he
ju&s;tified him&s;elf &s;o much to their &s;atisfaction, that he was
voted clear of all imputation, by a great majority. Never|thele&s;s,
they, at the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;ent over an ad|dre&s;s,
in which they bore te&s;timony to the mild and ju&s;t
admini&s;tration of their Lord Deputy.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. King William having taken &s;uch &s;teps as were
deemed nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving the peace of England in
his ab&s;ence, cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea to Holland in the middle of
May, fully determined to make &s;ome great effort in the
Netherlands, that might aggrandi&s;e his military character,
and humble the power of France, which was already in
the decline. That kingdom was actually exhau&s;ted in
&s;uch a manner, that the haughty Louis found him&s;elf
obliged to &s;tand upon the defen&s;ive again&s;t enemies over
whom he had been u&s;ed to triumph with uninterrupted
&s;ucce&s;s. He heard the clamours of his people, which he
could not quiet: he &s;aw his advances to peace rejected;
and to crown his misfortunes, he &s;u&s;tained an irreparable
lo&s;s in the death of Francis de Montmorency, Duke of
Luxembourg, to who&s;e military talents he owed the great|e&s;t
part of his glory and &s;ucce&s;s. That great officer died in
January at Ver&s;ailles, in the &s;ixty-&s;eventh year of his age;
and Louis lamented his death the more deeply, as he had
not another general left, in who&s;e under&s;tanding he could
con&s;ide. The conduct of the army in Flanders was en|tru&s;ted
to Mare&s;chal Villeroy; and Boufflers commanded
a &s;eparate army, though &s;ubject to the other's orders. As
the French King took it for granted, that the confederates
would have a &s;uperiority of numbers in the field, and was
well acquainted with the enterpri&s;ing genius of their chief,
he ordered a new line to be drawn between the Lys and
the Scheld: he cau&s;ed a di&s;po&s;ition to be made for covering
<PB N="234" REF="238">
Dunkirk, Ypres, Tournay, and Namur; and laid in|junctions
on his general to act &s;olely on the defen&s;ive.
Mean while, the confederates formed two armies in the
Netherlands. The fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventy battalions of
infantry, and eighty-two &s;quadrons of hor&s;e and dragoons,
chiefly Engli&s;h and Scots, encamped at Aer&s;eele, Ca|neghem,
and Wouterghem, between Thield and Deyn&s;e,
to be commanded by the King in per&s;on, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the
old Prince of Vaudemont. The other army, compo&s;ed
of &s;ixteen battalions of foot, and one hundred and thirty
&s;quadrons of hor&s;e, encamped at Zellich and Hamme, on
the road from Bru&s;&s;els to Dendermonde, under the com|mand
of the Elector of Bavaria, &s;econded by the Duke of
Hol&s;tein-Ploen. Major-General Ellemberg was po&s;ted
near Dixmuyde with twenty battalions and ten &s;quadrons;
and another body of Brandenburgh and Dutch troops,
with a re-enforcement from Liege, lay encamped on the
Mehaigne, under the conduct of the Baron de Heyden,
lieutenant-general of Brandenburgh, and the Count de
Berlo, general of the Liege cavalry. King William ar|rived
in the camp on the fifth day of July; and remained
eight days at Aer&s;eele. Then he marched to Bekelar,
while Villeroy retired behind his lines between Menin and
Ypres, after having detached ten thou&s;and men to re-en|force
Boufflers, who had advanced to Pont d'E&s;pieres:
but he too retreating within his lines, the Elector of Ba|varia
pa&s;&s;ed the Scheld, and took po&s;t at Kirkhoven: at
the &s;ame time the body under Heyden advanced towards
Namur.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. The King of England, having by his motions
drawn the forces of the enemy on the &s;ide of Flanders,
directed the Baron de Heyden and the Earl of Athlone,
who commanded forty &s;quadrons from the camp of the
Elector of Bavaria, to inve&s;t Namur; and this &s;ervice was
performed on the third day of July: but, as the place was
not entirely &s;urrounded, Mare&s;chal Bou&s;&s;lers threw him|&s;elf
into it, with &s;uch a re-enforcement of dragoons as
augmented the garri&s;on to the number of fifteen thou&s;and
<PB N="235" REF="239">
cho$en men. King William and the Elector brought up
the re&s;t of the forces, which encamped on both &s;ides of
the Sambre and the Mae&s;e; and the lines of circumvalla|tion
were begun on the &s;ixth day of July, under the di|rection
of the celebrated engineer, General Coehorn. The
place was formerly very &s;trong, both by &s;ituation and art;
but the French, &s;ince its la&s;t reduction, had made &s;uch
additional works, that both the town and citadel &s;eemed
impregnable. Con&s;idering the number of the garri&s;on,
and the quality of the troops, commanded by a mare&s;chal
of France, di&s;tingui&s;hed by his valour and conduct, the
enterpri&s;e was deemed an undeniable proof of William's
temerity. On the eleventh the trenches were opened, and
next day the batteries began to play with incredible fury.
The King receiving intelligence of a motion made by a
body of French troops, with a view to intercept the con|voys,
detached twenty &s;quadrons of hor&s;e and dragoons
to ob&s;erve the enemy.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. Prince Vaudemont, who was left at Ro&s;elaer
with fifty battalions, and the like number of &s;quadrons,
under&s;tanding that Villeroy had pa&s;&s;ed the Lys, in order
to attack him, took po&s;t with his left near Grammen, his
right by Aer&s;eele and Caneghem, and began to fortify his
camp, with a view to expect the enemy. Their vanguard
appearing on the evening of the thirteenth at Dentreghem,
he changed the di&s;po&s;ition of his camp, and entrenched
him&s;elf on both &s;ides. Next day, however, perceiving
Villeroy's de&s;ign was to &s;urround him, by means of ano|ther
body of troops commanded by M. Montal, who had
already pa&s;&s;ed the Thieldt for that purpo&s;e, he re&s;olved to
avoid an engagement, and effected a retreat to Ghent,
which is celebrated as one of the mo&s;t capital efforts of
military conduct. He forthwith detached twelve batta|lions
and twelve pieces of cannon, to &s;ecure Newport,
which Villeroy had intended to inve&s;t: but that general
now changed his re&s;olution, and undertook the &s;iege of
Dixmuyde, garri&s;oned by eight battalions of foot, and a
regiment of dragoons, commanded by Major-General
<PB N="236" REF="240">
Ellemberg, who, in &s;ix and thirty hours after the trenches
were opened, &s;urrendered him&s;elf and his &s;oldiers pri|&s;oners
of war. This &s;candalous example was followed by
Colonel Ofarrel, who yielded up Deyn&s;e on the &s;ame
&s;hameful conditions, even before a battery was opened by
the be&s;iegers. In the &s;equel they were both tried for their
mi&s;behaviour: Ellemberg &s;uffered death, and O&s;arrel
was broke with infamy. The Prince of Vaudemont &s;ent
a me&s;&s;age to the French general, demanding the garri&s;ons
of tho&s;e two places, according to a cartel which had
been &s;ettled between the powers at war; but no regard
was paid to this remon&s;trance. Villeroy, after &s;everal
marches and countermarches, appeared before Bru&s;&s;els, on
the thirteenth day of Augu&s;t, and &s;ent a letter to the
Prince of Berghem, governor of that city, importing,
that the King his ma&s;ter had ordered him to bombard
the town, by way of making repri&s;als for the damage done
by the Engli&s;h $leet to the maritime towns of France: he
likewi&s;ed de&s;ired to know in what part the Electre&s;s of
Bavaria re&s;ided, that he might not &s;ire into that quarter.
After this declaration, which was no more than an un|meaning
compliment, he began to bombard and cannonade
the place with red hot bullets, which produced conflagra|tions
in many different parts of the city, and frightened
the Electre&s;s into a mi&s;carriage. On the fifteenth, the
French di&s;continued their firing, and retired to Enghein.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the &s;iege of Namur
was pro&s;ecuted with great ardour, under the eye of the
King of England; while the garri&s;on defended the place
with equal &s;pirit and per&s;everance. On the eighteenth day
of July, Major-General Ram&s;ay and Lord Cutts, at the
head of five battalions, Engli&s;h, Scots, and Dutch, at|tacked
the enemy's advanced works, on the right of the
counter&s;carp. They were &s;u&s;tained by &s;ix Engli&s;h bat|talions,
commanded by Brigadier-General Fitzpatrick;
while eight foreign regiments, with nine thou&s;and pio|neers,
advanced on the le&s;t, under Major-General Sali&s;ch.
The a&s;&s;ault was de&s;perate and bloody, the enemy main|taining
<PB N="237" REF="241">
their ground for two hours with undaunted cou|rage:
but at la&s;t, they were obliged to give way, and
were pur&s;ued to the very gates of the town, though not
before they had killed or wounded twelve hundred men
of the confederate army. The King was &s;o well plea&s;ed
with the behaviour of the Briti&s;h troops, that during the
action he laid his hand upon the &s;houlder of the Elector
of Bavaria, and exclaimed with emotion, &startq;See my brave
Engli&s;h!&endq; On the twenty-&s;eventh, the Engli&s;h and
Scots, under Ram&s;ay and Hamilton, a&s;&s;aulted the coun|ter&s;carp,
where they met with prodigious oppo&s;ition from
the fire of the be&s;ieged. Neverthele&s;s, being &s;u&s;tained by
the Dutch, they made a lodgment on the foremo&s;t co|vered
way before the gates of St. Nicholas, as al&s;o upon
part of the counterguard. The valour of the a&s;&s;ailants
on this occa&s;ion was altogether unprecedented, and almo&s;t
incredible, while, on the other hand, the courage of the
be&s;ieged was worthy of prai&s;e and admiration. Several
per&s;ons were killed in the trenches at the &s;ide of the King,
and among the&s;e Mr. Godfrey, deputy-governor of the
Bank of England, who had come to the camp, to confer
with his Maje&s;ty about remitting money for the payment
of the army. On the thirtieth day of July the Elector
of Bavaria attacked Vauban's line that &s;urrounded the
works of the ca&s;tle. General Coehorn was pre&s;ent in this
action, which was performed with equal valour and &s;uc|ce&s;s.
They not only broke through the line, but even
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Coehorn's fort, in which, however,
they found it impo&s;&s;ible to effect a lodgment. On the &s;e|cond
day of Augu&s;t, Lord Cutts, with four hundred
Engli&s;h, and Dutch grenadiers, attacked the &s;aillant|angle
of a demi-ba&s;tion, and lodged him&s;elf on the &s;econd
counter&s;carp. The breaches being now practicable, and
preparations made for a general a&s;&s;ault, Count Gui&s;card,
the governor, capitulated for the town on the fourth of
Augu&s;t; and the French retired into the citadel, again&s;t
which twelve batteries played, upon the thirteenth. The
$renches, meanwhile, were carried on with great expe|dition,
<PB N="238" REF="242">
notwith&s;tanding all the efforts of the be&s;ieged,
who fired without cea&s;ing, and exerted amazing diligence
and intrepidity in defending and repairing the damage
they &s;u&s;tained. At length, the annoyance became &s;o dread|ful
from the unintermitting &s;howers of bombs and red
hot bullets, that Boufflers, after having made divers fu|rious
&s;allies, formed a &s;cheme for breaking through the
confederate camp with his cavalry. This, however, was pre|vented
by the extreme vigilance of King William.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. After the bombardment of Bru&s;&s;els, Villeroy be|ing
re-enforced with all the troops that could be drafted
from garri&s;ons, advanced towards Namur, with an army
of ninety thou&s;and men: and Prince Vaudemont being
joined by the Prince of He&s;&s;e, with a &s;trong body of for|ces
from the Rhine, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;trong camp
at Ma&s;y, within five Engli&s;h miles of the be&s;ieging army.
The King, under&s;tanding that the enemy had reached
Fleurus, where they di&s;charged ninety pieces of cannon,
as a &s;ignal to inform the garri&s;on of their approach, left
the conduct of the &s;iege to the Elector of Bavaria, and
took upon him&s;elf the command of the covering-army,
in order to oppo&s;e Villeroy, who being further re-enforced
by a detachment from Germany, declared, that he would
hazard a battle for the relief of Namur. But, when he
viewed the po&s;ture of the allies near Ma&s;y, he changed
his re&s;olution, and retired in the night without noi&s;e. On
the thirtieth day of Augu&s;t, the be&s;ieged were &s;ummoned
to &s;urrender, by Count Horn, who, in a parley with the
Count de Lamont, general of the French infantry, gave
him to under&s;tand, that Mare&s;chal Villeroy had retired
towards the Mehaigne; &s;o that the garri&s;on could not ex|pect
to be relieved. No immediate an&s;wer being returned
to this me&s;&s;age, the parley was broke off, and the King
re&s;olved to proceed without delay to a general a&s;&s;ault,
which he had already planned with the Elector and his
other generals. Between one and two in the afternoon,
Lord Cutts, who de&s;ired the command, though it was
not his turn of duty, ru&s;hed out of the trenches of the
<PB N="239" REF="243">
&s;econd line, at the head of three hundred grenadiers, to
$ake a lodgment in the breach of Terra-nova, &s;upported
$y the regiments of Coulthorp, Buchan, Hamilton, and
Mackay; while Colonel Mar&s;elly, with a body of Dutch,
$he Bavarians, and Brandenburghers, attacked at two
$ther places. The a&s;&s;ailants met with &s;uch a warm recep|$ion,
that the Engli&s;h grenadiers were repul&s;ed, even af|ter
they had mounted the breach, Lord Cutts being for
&s;ome time di&s;abled by a &s;hot in the head. Mar&s;elly was
defeated, taken, and afterwards killed by a cannon-ball
from the batteries of the be&s;iegers. The Bavarians, by mi&s;|taking
their way, were expo&s;ed to a terrible fire, by which
$heir general, Count Rivera, and a great number of
$heir officers were &s;lain: neverthele&s;s, they fixed them|&s;elves
on the outward entrenchment, on the point of the
Coehorn next to the Sambre, and maintained their ground
with amazing fortitude. Lord Cutts, when his wound
was dre&s;&s;ed, returned to the &s;cene of action, and ordered
$wo hundred cho&s;en men of Mackay's regiment, com|manded
by Lieutenant Cockle, to attack the face of the
&s;aillant-angle next to the breach, &s;word in hand, while
the en&s;igns of the &s;ame regiment &s;hould advance, and plant
their colours on the palli&s;adoes. Cockle and his detach|ment
executed the command he had received with admi|rable
intrepidity. They broke through the palli&s;adoes,
drove the French from the covered-way, made a lodg|ment
in one of the batteries, and turned the cannon
again&s;t the enemy. The Bavarians being thus &s;u&s;tained,
made their po&s;t good. The Major-generals La Cave and
Schwerin lodged them&s;elves at the &s;ame time on the co|vered
way; and though the general a&s;&s;ault did not &s;ucceed
in its full extent, the confederates remained ma&s;ters of
a very con&s;iderable lodgment, nearly an Engli&s;h mile in
$ength. Yet this was dearly purcha&s;ed with the lives of
two thou&s;and men, including many officers of great rank
and reputation. During the action the Elector of Bavaria
&s;ignalized his courage in a very remarkable manner, riding
from place to place through the hotte&s;t of the fire, giving
<PB N="240" REF="244">
his directions with notable pre&s;ence of mind, according
to the emergency of circum&s;tances, animating the officers
with prai&s;e and promi&s;e of preferment, and di&s;tributing
handfuls of gold among the private &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. On the fir&s;t day of September, the be&s;ieged
having obtained a ce&s;&s;ation of arms, that their dead might
be buried, the Count de Gui&s;card appearing on the breach
de&s;ired to &s;peak with the Elector of Bavaria. His High|ne&s;s
immediately mounting the breach, the French go|vernor
offered to &s;urrender the fort of Coehorn; but was
given to under&s;tand, that if he intended to capitulate, he
mu&s;t treat for the whole. This reply being communicated
to Boufflers, he agreed to the propo&s;al: the ce&s;&s;ation was
prolonged, and that very evening the capitulation was
fini&s;hed. Villeroy, who lay encamped at Gemblours,
was no &s;ooner appri&s;ed of this event, by a triple di&s;charge
of all the artillery, and a running fire along the lines of
the confederate army, than he pa&s;&s;ed the Sambre near
Charleroy, with great precipitation; and having re-en|forced
the garri&s;on of Dinant, retreated towards the lines
iu the neighbourhood of Mons. On the fifth day of Sep|tember,
the French garri&s;on, which was now reduced
from fifteen to five thou&s;and five hundred men, evacua|ated
the city of Namur. Boufflers, in marching out, was
arre&s;ted in the name of his Britannick Maje&s;ty, by way
of repri&s;al for the garri&s;ons of Dixmuyde and Deyn&s;e,
which the French King had detained, contrary to the
cartel &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two nations. The Mare&s;chal
was not a little di&s;compo&s;ed at this unexpected incident,
and expo&s;tulated warmly with Mr. Dyckvelt, who a&s;&s;ured
him the King of Great Britain entertained a profound
re&s;pect for his per&s;on and character. William even offered
to &s;et him at liberty, provided he would pa&s;s his word,
that the garri&s;on of Dixmuyde and Deyn&s;e &s;hould be
&s;ent back, or that he him&s;elf would return in a fortnight.
He &s;aid, that he could not enter into any &s;uch engagement,
as he did not know his ma&s;ter's rea&s;ons for detaining the
<PB N="241" REF="245">
garri&s;ons in que&s;tion. He was, therefore, re-conveyed to
Namur; from thence removed to Mae&s;tricht, and treated
with great reverence and re&s;pect, till the return of an offi|cer
whom he had di&s;patched to Ver&s;ailles with an ac|count
of his captivity. Then he engaged his word, that
the garri&s;ons of Dixmuyde and Deyn&s;e &s;hould be &s;ent
back to the allied army. He was immediately relea&s;ed,
and conducted in &s;afety to Dinant. When he repaired to
Ver&s;ailles, Louis received him with very extraordinary
marks of e&s;teem and affection. He embraced him in pub|lick
with the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of regard; declared
him&s;elf perfectly well &s;atisfied with his conduct; created
him a Duke and peer of France; and pre&s;ented him with
a very large &s;um, in acknowledgement of his &s;ignal &s;er|vices.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. After the reduction of Namur, which greatly
enhanced the military character of King William, he re|tired
to his hou&s;e at Loo, which was his favourite place
of re&s;idence, leaving the command to the Elector of Ba|varia;
and about the latter end of September both armies
began to &s;eparate. The French forces retired within their
lines. A good number of the allied troops were di&s;tributed
in different garri&s;ons; and a &s;trong detachment marched
towards Newport, under the command of the Prince of
Wirtemberg, for the &s;ecurity of that place. Thus ended
the campaign in the Netherlands. On the Rhine, nothing
of moment was attempted by either army. The Mare&s;chal
de Lorges, in the beginning of June, pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine at
Philip&s;burgh; and po&s;ting him&s;elf at Bruck&s;al, &s;ent out
parties to ravage the country. On the eleventh of the &s;ame
month the Prince of Baden joined the German army at
Steppach, and on the eighth of July was re-enforced by the
troops of the other German confederates, in the neigh|bourhood
of Wi&s;elock. On the nineteenth, the French
retired without noi&s;e, in the night, towards Manheim,
where they repa&s;&s;ed the river, without any interruption
from the Imperial General; then he &s;ent off a large de|tachment
to Flanders. The &s;ame &s;tep was taken by the
<PB N="242" REF="246">
Prince of Baden; and each army lay inactive in their
quarters for the remaining part of the campaign. The
command of the Germans in Hungary was conferred upon
the Elector of Saxony: but the court of Vienna was &s;o
dilatory in their preparations, that he was not in a con|dition
to act till the middle of Augu&s;t. Lord Paget had
been &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador from England to the Ottoman
Porte, with in&s;tructions relating to a pacification: but,
before he could obtain an audience, the Sultan died, and
was &s;ucceeded by his nephew, Mu&s;tapha, who re&s;olved to
pro&s;ecute the war in per&s;on. The warlike genius of this
new emperor afforded but an uncomfortable pro&s;pect to
his people, con&s;idering that Peter, the Czar of Mu&s;covy,
had taken the opportunity of the War in Hungary, to in|vade
the Crimea, and be&s;iege Azoph: &s;o that the Tar|tars
were too much employed at home to &s;pare the &s;uc|cours
which the Sultan demanded. Neverthele&s;s, Mu&s;ta|pha
and his vi&s;ir took the field before the Imperiali&s;ts could
commence the operations of the campaign, pa&s;&s;ed the
Danube, took Lippa and Titul by a&s;&s;ault, &s;tormed the
camp of General Veterani, who was po&s;ted at Lugos with
&s;even thou&s;and men, and who lo&s;t his life in the action.
The infantry were cut to pieces, after having made a de&s;|perate
defence: but the hor&s;e retreated to Carou&s;ebes,
under the conduct of General Tru&s;ches. The Turks, after
this exploit, retired to Or&s;owa. Their navy, meanwhile,
&s;urpri&s;ed the Venetian fleet at Scio, where &s;everal &s;hips
of the republick were de&s;troyed, and they recovered
that i&s;land, which the Venetians thought proper to aban|don:
but, in order to balance this misfortune, the&s;e la&s;t
obtained a complete victory over the Ba&s;haw of Negropont
in the Morea.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. The French King &s;till maintained a &s;ecret
negociation with the Duke of Savoy, who&s;e conduct had
been for &s;ome time my&s;terious and equivocal. Contrary
to the opinion of his allies, he undertook the &s;iege of Ca&s;al,
which was counted one of the &s;tronge&s;t fortifications in
Europe, defended by a numerous garri&s;on, abundantly
<PB N="243" REF="247">
&s;upplied with ammunition and provi&s;ion. The &s;iege was
begun about the middle of May; and the place was &s;ur|rendered
by capitulation in about fourteen days, to the
a&s;toni&s;hment of the confederates, who did not know that
this was a &s;acrifice by which the French court obtained
the Duke's forbearance during the remaining part of the
campaign. The capitulation imported, That the place
&s;hould be re&s;tored to the Duke of Mantua, who was the
rightful proprietor: That the fortifications &s;hould be de|moli&s;hed
at the expen&s;e of the allies: that the garri&s;on
&s;hould remain in the fort till that work &s;hould be com|pleted:
and ho&s;tages were exchanged for the performance
of the&s;e conditions. The Duke under&s;tood the art of
procra&s;tination &s;o well, that September was far advanced
before the place was wholly di&s;mantled; and then he was
&s;ei&s;ed with an ague, which obliged him to quit the army.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. In Catalonia the French could hardly maintain
the footing they had gained. Admiral Ru&s;&s;el, who win|tered
at Cadix, was created admiral, chief commander,
and captain-general of all his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips employed,
or to be employed in the Narrow-Seas, and in the Medi|terranean.
He was re-enforced by four thou&s;and five hun|dred
&s;oldiers, under the command of Brigadier-General
Stewart; and &s;even thou&s;and men, Imperiali&s;ts as well as
Spaniards, were drafted from Italy, for the defence of
Catalonia. The&s;e forces were tran&s;ported to Barcelona,
under the convoy of Admiral Nevil, detached by Ru&s;&s;el
for that purpo&s;e. The affairs of Catalonia had already
changed their a&s;pect. Several French parties had been de|feated.
The Spaniards had blocked up O&s;talric and Ca&s;tel-Follit:
Noailles had been recalled, and the command de|volved
to the Duke de Vendome, who no &s;ooner under|&s;tood
that the forces from Italy were landed, than he di&s;|mantled
O&s;talric and Ca&s;tel-Follit, and retired to Palamos.
The viceroy of Catalonia, and the Engli&s;h Admiral hav|ing
re&s;olved to give battle to the enemy, and reduce Pa|lamos,
the Engli&s;h troops were landed on the ninth day
of Augu&s;t, and the allied army advanced to Palamos.
<PB N="244" REF="248">
The French appeared in order of battle: but the viceroy
declined an engagement. Far from attacking the enemy,
he withdrew his forces, and the town was bombarded by
the admiral. The mi&s;carriage of this expedition was in a
great mea&s;ure owing to a mi&s;under&s;tanding between Ru&s;&s;el
and the court of Spain. The Admiral complained that his
Catholic Maje&s;ty had made no preparations for the cam|paign;
that he had neglected to fulfil his engagements
with re&s;pect to the Spani&s;h &s;quadron, which ought to have
joined the fleets of England and Holland: that he had
taken no care to provide tents and provi&s;ion for the Bri|ti&s;h
forces. On the the twenty-&s;eventh day of Augu&s;t he
failed for the coa&s;t of Provence, where his fleet was en|dangered
by a terrible tempe&s;t; then he &s;teered down
the Straits, and towards the latter end of September ar|rived
in the bay of Cadix. There he left a number of &s;hips
under the command of Sir David Mitchel, until he
&s;hould be joined by Sir George Rooke, who was expected
from England, and returned home with the re&s;t of the
combined &s;quadrons.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. While Admiral Ru&s;&s;el a&s;&s;erted the Briti&s;h do|minion
in the Mediterranean, the French coa&s;ts were again
in&s;ulted in the channel by a &s;eparate fleet, under the com|mand
of Lord Berkeley of Stratton, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Dutch
Admiral Allemonde. On the fourth day of July they an|chored
before St. Maloes, which they bombarded from
nine ketches covered by &s;ome frigates, which &s;u&s;tained
more damage than was done to the enemy. On the &s;ixth
Granville underwent the &s;ame fate; and then the &s;leet
returned to Port&s;mouth. The bomb-ve&s;&s;els being refitted,
the &s;leet &s;ailed round to the Downs, where four hundred
&s;oldiers were embarked for an attempt upon Dunkirk,
under the direction of Mee&s;ters, the famous Dutch engi|gineer,
who had prepared his infernals, and other machines
for the &s;ervice. On the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t the experi|ment
was tried without &s;ucce&s;s. The bombs did &s;ome ex|ecution:
but two &s;moak &s;hips mi&s;carried. The French
had &s;ecured the Ri&s;bank and wooden forts, with piles,
bombs, chains, and &s;loating batteries, in &s;uch a manner,
<PB N="245" REF="249">
that the machine-ve&s;&s;els could not approach near enough
to produce any effect. Be&s;ides, the councils of the a&s;&s;ail|ants
were di&s;tracted by violent animo&s;ities. The Engli&s;h
officers hated Mee&s;ters, becau&s;e he was a Dutchman, and
had acquired &s;ome credit with the King: he, on the other
hand, treated them with di&s;re&s;pect. He retired with his
machines in the night, and refu&s;ed to co-operate with
Lord Berkeley in his de&s;ign upon Calais, which was now
put in execution. On the &s;ixteenth he brought his batte|ries
to bear upon this place, and &s;et fire to it in different
quarters: but the enemy had taken &s;uch precautions as
rendered his &s;cheme abortive.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. A &s;quadron had been &s;ent to the We&s;t Indies
under the joint-command of Captain Robert Wilmot
and Colonel Liling&s;ton, with twelve hundred land-forces.
They had in&s;tructions to co-operate with the Spaniards
in Hi&s;paniola, again&s;t the French &s;ettlements on that i&s;|land,
and to de&s;troy their fi&s;heries on the banks of New|foundland,
in their return. They were accordingly joined
by &s;eventeen hundred Spaniards rai&s;ed by the pre&s;ident
of St. Domingo: but, in&s;tead of proceeding again&s;t Petit-Guavas,
according to the directions they had received,
Wilmot took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Fort Francois, and plundered
the country for his own private advantage, notwith&s;tand|ing
the remon&s;trances of Liling&s;ton, who prote&s;ted a|gain&s;t
his conduct. In a word, the &s;ea and land officers
lived in a &s;tate of perpetual di&s;&s;ention; and both became
extremely di&s;agreeable to the Spaniards, who &s;oon re|nounced
all connexion with them and their de&s;igns. In
the beginning of September the Commodore &s;et &s;ail for
England, and lo&s;t one of his &s;hips in the gulph of Florida.
He him&s;elf died in the pa&s;&s;age; and the greater part of
the men being &s;wept off by an epidemical di&s;temper, the
&s;quadron returned to Britain in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable condi|tion.
Notwith&s;tanding the great efforts the nation had
made to maintain &s;uch a number of different &s;quadrons
for the protection of commerce, as well as to annoy the
enemy, the trade &s;uffered &s;everely from the French priva|teers,
<PB N="246" REF="250">
which &s;warmed in both channels, and made prize of
many rich ve&s;&s;els. The Marquis of Caermarthen, being
&s;tationed with a &s;quadron off the Scilly i&s;lands, mi&s;took
a fleet of merchant &s;hips for the Bre&s;t fleet, and retired
with precipation to Milford-Haven. In con&s;equenc$ of
this retreat, the privateers took a good number of &s;hips
from Barbardoes, and five from the Ea&s;t-Indies, valued
at a million &s;terling. The merchants renewed their cla|mour
again&s;t the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty, who
produced their orders and in&s;tructions in their own de|fence.
The Marquis of Caermarthen had been guilty of
flagrant mi&s;conduct on this occa&s;ion: but, the chief &s;ource
of tho&s;e national calamities was the circum&s;tantial intelli|gence
tran&s;mitted to France from time to time, by the
malcontents of England; for they were actuated by a &s;can|dalous
principle, which they &s;till retain, namely, that of
rejoicing in the di&s;tre&s;s of their country.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. King William, after having conferred with the
States of Holland, and the Elector of Brandenburgh, who
met him at the Hague, embarked for England on the
nineteenth day of October, and arrived in &s;afety at Mar|gate,
from whence he proceeded to London, where he
was received as a conqueror, amid&s;t the rejoicings and
acclamations of the people. On the &s;ame day he &s;ummoned
a council at Ken&s;ington, in which it was determined to
convoke a new parliament. While the nation was in good
humour, it was &s;uppo&s;ed that they would return &s;uch
members only as were well affected to the government;
whereas, the pre&s;ent parliament might proceed in its
enquiries into corruption and other grievances, and be
the le&s;s influenced by the crown, as their dependence
was of &s;uch &s;hort duration. The parliament was, there|fore,
di&s;&s;olved by proclamation, and a new one &s;um|moned
to meet at We&s;tmin&s;ter on the twenty-&s;econd day
of November. While the whole nation was occupied in
the elections, William, by the advice of his chief confi|dants,
laid his own di&s;po&s;ition under re&s;traint, in another
effort to acquire popularity. He honoured the diver&s;ions
<PB N="247" REF="251">
of Newmarket with his pre&s;ence, and there received a
compliment of congratulation from the univer&s;ity of Cam|bridge.
Then he vi&s;ited the Earls of Sunderland, Nor|thampton,
and Montague, at their different hou&s;es in the
country; and proceeded with a &s;plendid retinue to Lin|coln,
from whence he repaired to Welbeck, a &s;eat belong|ing
to the Duke of Newca&s;tle in Nottingham&s;hire, where
he was attended by Dr. Sharp, Archbi&s;hop of York, and
his clergy. He lodged one night with Lord Brooke, at
Warwick-ca&s;tle, dined with the Duke of Shrew&s;bury at
Eyefort, and, by the way of Wood&s;tock, made a &s;olemn
entry into Oxford, having been met at &s;ome di&s;tance from
the city by the Duke of Ormond, as Chancellor of the
Univer&s;ity, the Vice-Chancellor, the doctors in their
habits, and the magi&s;trates in their formalities. He pro|ceeded
directly to the theatre, where he was welcomed in
an elegant Latin &s;peech: he received from the Chancellor
on his knees, the u&s;ual pre&s;ents of a large Engli&s;h Bible,
and book of Common-Prayer, the cuts of the univer&s;ity,
and a pair of gold-fringe gloves. The conduits ran with
wine, and a magnificent banquet was prepared: but, an
anonymous letter being found in the &s;treet, importing,
that there was a de&s;ign to poi&s;on his Maje&s;ty, William re|fu&s;ed
to eat or drink in Oxford, and retired immediately
to Wind&s;or. Notwith&s;tanding this abrupt departure,
which did not &s;avour much of magnanimity, the univer&s;ity
cho&s;e Sir William Trumbal, Secretary of State, as one of
their repre&s;entatives in parliament.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. The Whig-intere&s;t generally prevailed in the
elections, though many even of that party were malcon|tents;
and when the parliament met, Foley was again
cho&s;en Speaker of the Commons. The King, in his fir&s;t
&s;peech, extolled the valour of the Engli&s;h forces; expre&s;&s;ed
his concern at being obliged to demand &s;uch large &s;upplies
from his people; ob&s;erved, that the funds had proved very
deficient, and the civil li&s;t was in a precarious condition;
recommended to their compa&s;&s;ion the mi&s;erable &s;ituation
of the French prote&s;tants: took notice of the bad &s;tate of
<PB N="248" REF="252">
the coin; de&s;ired they would form a good bill for the en|couragement
and increa&s;e of &s;eamen; and contrive laws
for the advancement of commerce. He mentioned the
great preparations which the French were making for
taking the field early; intreated them to u&s;e di&s;patch;
expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at the choice which his people
had made of their repre&s;entatives in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons;
and exhorted them to proceed with temper and
unanimity. Though the two Hou&s;es pre&s;ented addre&s;&s;es
of congratulation to the King, upon his late &s;ucce&s;s, and
promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in pro&s;ecuting the war with vigour,
the nation loudly exclaimed again&s;t the intolerable bur|thens
and lo&s;&s;es to which they were &s;ubjected, by a foreign
&s;cheme of politicks, which, like an unfathomable aby&s;s,
&s;wallowed up the wealth and blood of the kingdom. All
the King's endeavours to cover the di&s;gu&s;ting &s;ide of his
character had proved ineffectual: he was &s;till dry, re|&s;erved,
and forbidding; and the malcontents inveighed
bitterly again&s;t his behaviour to the Prince&s;s Anne of Den|mark.
When the news of Namur's being reduced arrived
in England, this lady congratulated him upon his &s;ucce&s;s
in a dutiful letter, to which he would not deign to &s;end a
reply, either by writing or me&s;&s;age; nor had &s;he or her
hu&s;band been favoured with the &s;lighte&s;t mark of regard
&s;ince his return to England. The members in the Lower-Hou&s;e,
who had adopted oppo&s;ing maxims, either from
principle or re&s;entment, re&s;olved, That the crown &s;hould
purcha&s;e the &s;upplies with &s;ome conce&s;&s;ion in favour of
the people. They, therefore, brought in the &s;o long con|te&s;ted
bill for regulating tryals in ca&s;es of high-trea&s;on,
and mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on; and, con&s;idering the critical
juncture of affairs, the courtiers were afraid of ob&s;tructing
&s;uch a popular mea&s;ure. The Lords in&s;erted a clau&s;e,
enacting, That a peer &s;hould be tried by the whole
peerage; and the Commons at once a&s;&s;ented to this
amendment. The bill provided, That per&s;ons indicted
for high-trea&s;on, or mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, &s;hould be fur|ni&s;hed
with a copy of the indictment, five days before the
<PB N="249" REF="253">
tryal; and indulged with coun&s;el to plead in their de|fence:
That no per&s;on &s;hould be indicted but upon the
oaths of two lawful witne&s;&s;es &s;wearing to overt-acts:
That in two or more di&s;tinct trea&s;ons of divers kinds,
alledged in one bill of indictment, one witne&s;s to one,
and another witne&s;s to another, &s;hould not be deemed two
witne&s;&s;es: That no per&s;on &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted for any
&s;uch crime, unle&s;s the indictment be found within three
years after the offence committed, except in ca&s;e of a de|&s;ign
or attempt to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate or poi&s;on the King, where
this limitation &s;hould not take place: That per&s;ons in|dicted
for trea&s;on, or mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on, &s;hould be &s;up|plied
with copies of the pannel of the jurors, two days at
lea&s;t before the tryal, and have proce&s;s to compel their wit|ne&s;&s;es
to appear: That no evidence &s;hould be admitted of
any overt-act not expre&s;ly laid in the indictment: That
this act &s;hould not extend to any impeachment, or other
proceedings in parliament; nor to any indictment for
counterfeiting his Maje&s;ty's coin, his great-&s;eal, privy-&s;eal,
&s;ign-manual, or &s;ignet.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. This important affair being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the
Commons proceeded to examine the accompts and e&s;timates,
and voted above five millions for the &s;ervice of the en&s;uing
year. The &s;tate of the coin was by this time become &s;uch
a national grievance as could not e&s;cape the attention of
parliament. The Lords prepared an addre&s;s to the throne,
for a proclamation to put a &s;top to the currency of dimi|ni&s;hed
coin; and to this they de&s;ired the concurrence of
the Commons. The Lower-Hou&s;e, however, determined
to take this affair under their own in&s;pection. They ap|pointed
a committee of the whole Hou&s;e, to deliberate on
the &s;tate of the nation with re&s;pect to the currency. Great
oppo&s;ition was made to a recoinage, which was a mea&s;ure
&s;trenuou&s;ly recommended and &s;upported by Mr. Monta|gue,
who acted on this occa&s;ion by the advice of the great
mathematician Sir I&s;aac Newton. The enemies of this
expedient argued, that &s;hould the &s;ilver coin be called in,
it would be impo&s;&s;ible to maintain the war abroad, or pro|&s;ecute
<PB N="250" REF="254">
foreign trade, ina&s;much as the merchant could not
pay his bills of exchange, nor the &s;oldier receive his &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence:
that a &s;top would be put to all mutual payment;
and this would produce univer&s;al confu&s;ion and de&s;pair.
Such a reformation could not be effected without &s;ome
danger and difficulty; but it was become ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary,
as the evil daily increa&s;ed, and in a little time mu&s;t
have terminated in national anarchy. After long and ve|hement
debates, the majority re&s;olved to proceed with all
po&s;&s;ible expedition to a new coinage. Another que&s;tion
aro&s;e, Whether the new coin, in its different denomi|nations,
&s;hould retain the original weight and purity of
the old; or the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;tandard be rai&s;ed in value?
The famous Locke engaged in this di&s;pute again&s;t Mr.
Lowndes, who propo&s;ed that the &s;tandard &s;hould be rai&s;ed:
the arguments of Mr. Locke were &s;o convincing, that the
committee re&s;olved the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;tandard &s;hould be pre|&s;erved
with re&s;pect to weight and finene&s;s. They like|wi&s;e
re&s;olved, That the lo&s;s accruing to the revenue from
clipped money, &s;hould be born'd by the publick. In order
to prevent a total &s;tagnation, they further re&s;olved, That
after an appointed day, no clipped money &s;hould pa&s;s in
payment, except to the collectors of the revenue and
taxes, or upon loans or payments into the Exchequer:
That, after another day to be appointed, no clipped money
of any &s;ort &s;hould pa&s;s in any payment what&s;oever; and
that a third day &s;hould be fixed for all per&s;ons to bring in
their clipped money to be recoined, after which they &s;hould
have no allowance upon what they might offer. They
addre&s;&s;ed the King to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation agreeably to
the&s;e re&s;olutions; and, on the nineteenth day of Decem|ber,
it was publi&s;hed accordingly. Such were the fears
of the people, augmented and inflamed by the enemies of
the government, that all payment immediately cea&s;ed,
and a face of di&s;traction appeared through the whole com|munity.
The adver&s;aries of the bill &s;ei&s;ed this opportunity
to aggravate the apprehen&s;ions of the publick. They
inveighed again&s;t the mini&s;try, as the authors of this
<PB N="251" REF="255">
national grievance: they levelled their &s;atire particularly
at Montague; and it required uncommon fortitude and
addre&s;s to avert the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences of popu|lar
di&s;content. The Hou&s;e of Commons agreed to the
following re&s;olutions, that twelve hundred thou&s;and
pounds &s;hould be rai&s;ed by a duty on gla&s;s-windows, to
make up the lo&s;s on the clipped money: That the recom|pen&s;e
for &s;upplying the deficiency of clipped money &s;hould
extend to all &s;ilver coin, though of a coar&s;er alloy than
the &s;tandard: That the collectors and receivers of his
Maje&s;ty's aids and revenues &s;hould be enjoined to receive
all &s;uch monies: That a reward of five per cent. &s;hould
be given to all &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;hould bring in either
milled or broad unclipped money, to be applied in ex|change
of the clipped money throughout the kingdom;
That a reward of three pence per ounce &s;hould be given
to all per&s;ons who &s;hould bring in wrought plate to the
mint to be coined: That per&s;ons might pay in their whole
next year's land-tax in clipped money, at one convenient
time to be appointed for that purpo&s;e: That commi&s;&s;ioners
&s;hould be appointed in every country, to pay and di&s;tribute
the milled and broad unclipped money, and the new coined
money in lieu of that which was dimini&s;hed. A bill being
prepared agreeably to the&s;e determinations, was &s;ent up to
the Hou&s;e of Lords, who made &s;ome amendments, which
the Commons rejected: but, in order to avoid cavils and
conferences, they dropped the bill, and brought in another
without the clau&s;es which the Lords had in&s;erted. They
were again propo&s;ed in the Upper-Hou&s;e, and over-ruled
by the majority; and, on the twenty-fir&s;t day of January,
the bill received the royal a&s;&s;ent, as did another bill, en|larging
the time for purcha&s;ing annuities, and continuing
the duties on low wines. At the &s;ame time, the King
pa&s;&s;ed the bill of tryals for high-trea&s;on, and an act to
prevent mercenary elections. Divers merchants and
traders petitioned the Hou&s;e of Commons, that the lo&s;&s;es
in their trade and payments, occa&s;ioned by the ri&s;e of
guineas, might be taken into con&s;ideration. A bill was
<PB N="252" REF="256">
immediately brought in for taking off the obligation and
encouragement for coining guineas, for a certain time:
and then the Commons proceeded to lower the value of this
coin; a ta&s;k in which they met with great oppo&s;ition from
&s;ome members, who alledged that it would foment the
popular di&s;turbances. At length, however, the majority
agreed, that a guinea &s;hould be lowered from thirty to
eight and twenty &s;hillings, and afterwards to &s;ix and
twenty: at length a clau&s;e was in&s;erted in the bill for
encouraging people to bring plate to the mint, &s;ettling the
price of a guinea at two and twenty &s;hillings, and it na|turally
&s;unk to its original value of twenty &s;hillings and
&s;ix-pence. Many per&s;ons, however, &s;uppo&s;ing that the
price of gold would be rai&s;ed in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion, hoarded
up their guineas; and, upon the &s;ame &s;uppo&s;ition, en|couraged
by the malcontents, the new coined &s;ilver money
was re&s;erved, to the great detriment of commerce. The
King ordered mints to be erected in York, Bri&s;tol, Exeter,
and Che&s;ter, for the purpo&s;e of the recoinage, which was
executed with unexpected &s;ucce&s;s; &s;o that, in le&s;s than a
year, the currency of England, which had been the wor&s;t,
became the be&s;t coin in Europe.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. At this period, the attention of the Commons
was diverted to an object of a more private nature. The
Earl of Portland, who enjoyed the greate&s;t &s;hare of the
King's favour, had obtained a grant of &s;ome lord&s;hips in
Derby&s;hire. While the warrant was depending, the
gentlemen of that county re&s;olved to oppo&s;e it with all
their power. In con&s;equence of a petition, they were
indulged with a hearing by the Lords of the Trea&s;ury.
Sir William Williams, in the name of the re&s;t, alledged,
that the lord&s;hips in que&s;tion were the ancient deme&s;nes of
the Prince of Wales, ab&s;olutely unalienable: that the
revenues of tho&s;e lord&s;hips &s;upported the government of
Wales, in paying the judges and other &s;alaries: that the
grant was of too large an extent for any foreign &s;ubject;
and that the people of the county were too great to be
&s;ubject to any foreigner. Sundry other &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons
<PB N="253" REF="257">
were u&s;ed again&s;t the grant, which, notwith&s;tanding all
their remon&s;trances, would have pa&s;&s;ed through the offices,
had not the Welch gentlemen addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves by pe|tition
to the Hou&s;e of Commons. Upon this occa&s;ion,
Mr. Price, a member of the Hou&s;e, harangued with
great &s;everity again&s;t the Dutch in general, and did not
even ab&s;tain from &s;arca&s;ms upon the King's per&s;on, title,
and government. The objections &s;tarted by the petition|ers
being duely con&s;idered, were found &s;o rea&s;onable,
that the Commons pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the King, re|pre&s;enting,
That tho&s;e manours had been u&s;ually annexed
to the principality of Wales, and &s;ettled on the Princes
of Wales for their &s;upport: That many per&s;ons in tho&s;e
parts held their e&s;tates by royal tenure, under great and
valuable compo&s;itions, rents, royal payments, and &s;er|vices
to the crown and Princes of Wales; and enjoyed
great privileges and advantages under &s;uch tenure. They,
therefore, be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty to recal the grant, which
was in diminution of the honour and intere&s;t of the crown;
and prayed, that the &s;aid manours and lands might not be
alienated without the con&s;ent of parliament. This addre&s;s
met with a cold reception from the King, who promi&s;ed
to recall the grant which had given &s;uch offence to the
Commons; and &s;aid he would find &s;ome other way of
&s;howing his favour to the Earl of Portland.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. The people in general entertained a national
aver&s;ion to this nobleman: the malcontents inculcated a
notion that he made u&s;e of his intere&s;t and intelligence to
injure the trade of England, that the commerce of his
own country might flouri&s;h without competition. To his
&s;ugge&s;tions they imputed the act and patent in favour of
the Scotti&s;h company, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been
thrown in as a bone of contention between the two king|doms.
The &s;ubject was fir&s;t &s;tarted in the Hou&s;e of Lords,
who invited the Commons to a conference: a committee
was appointed to examine into the particulars of the act
for erecting the Scotti&s;h company; and the two Hou&s;es
pre&s;ented a joint addre&s;s again&s;t it, as a &s;cheme that would
<PB N="254" REF="258">
prejudice all the &s;ubjects concerned in the wealth and
trade of the Engli&s;h nation. They repre&s;ented, that, in
con&s;equence of the exemption from taxes, and other ad|vantages
granted to the Scotti&s;h company, that kingdom
would become a free port for all Ea&s;t and We&s;t India
commodities: that the Scots would be enabled to &s;upply
all Europe at a cheaper rate than the Engli&s;h could afford
to &s;ell their merchandi&s;e for; therefore, England would
lo&s;e the benefit of its foreign trade: be&s;ides, they ob|&s;erved
that the Scots would &s;muggle their commodities
into England, to the great detriment of his Maje&s;ty and
his cu&s;toms. To this remon&s;trance the King replied,
That he had been ill &s;erved in Scotland; but that he
hoped &s;ome remedies would be found to prevent the incon|veniencies
of which they were apprehen&s;ive. In all pro|bability
he had been impo&s;ed upon by the mini&s;try of that
kingdom; for, in a little time, he di&s;carded the Marquis
of Tweedale, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed both the Scotti&s;h &s;ecretaries
of &s;tates, in lieu of whom he appointed Lord Murray, &s;on
to the Marquis of Athol. Notwith&s;tanding the King's
an&s;wer, the committee proceeded on the enquiry, and, in
con&s;equence of the report, confirming a petition from
the Ea&s;t-India Company, the Hou&s;e re&s;olved, That the
directors of the Scotti&s;h company were guilty of a high
crime and mi&s;demeanour, in admini&s;tering and taking an
oath <HI>de fideli</HI> in this kingdom; and that they &s;hould be
impeached for the &s;ame. Mean while, Roderick Mac|kenzie,
from whom they had received their chief informa|tion,
began to retract his evidence, and was ordered into
cu&s;tody: but he made his e&s;cape, and could not be re|taken,
although the King, at their reque&s;t, i&s;&s;ued a pro|clamation
for that purpo&s;e. The Scots were extremely
incen&s;ed again&s;t the King, when they under&s;tood he had
di&s;owned their company, from which they had promi&s;ed
them&s;elves &s;uch wealth and advantage. The &s;ettlement of
Darien was already planned, and afterwards put in exe|cution;
though it mi&s;carried in the &s;equel, and had like
to have produced abundance of mi&s;chief.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="259">
&sect; XXVII. The complaints of the Engli&s;h merchants
who had &s;uffered by the war were &s;o loud at this juncture,
that the Commons re&s;olved to take their ca&s;e into con&s;i|deration.
The Hou&s;e re&s;olved it&s;elf into a committee to
con&s;ider the &s;tate of the nation with regard to commerce,
and having duely weighed all circum&s;tances, agreed to the
following re&s;olutions: That a council of trade &s;hould be
e&s;tabli&s;hed by act of parliament, with powers to take mea|&s;ures
for the more effectual pre&s;ervation of commerce:
That the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be nominated by parlia|ment,
but none of them have &s;eats in the Hou&s;e: That
they &s;hould take an oath, acknowledging the title of King
William as rightful and lawful; and abjuring the pre|ten&s;ions
of James, or any other per&s;on. The King con|&s;idered
the&s;e re&s;olutions as an open attack upon his prero|gative,
and &s;ignified his di&s;plea&s;ure to the Earl of Sunder|land,
who patroni&s;ed this mea&s;ure: but it was &s;o popular
in the Hou&s;e, that in all probability it would have been
put in execution, had not the attention of the Commons
been diverted from it at this period by the detection of a
new con&s;piracy. The friends of King James had, upon
the death of Queen Mary, renewed their practices for
effecting a re&s;toration of that monarch, on the &s;uppo&s;ition
that the intere&s;t of William was con&s;iderably weakened
by the decea&s;e of his con&s;ort. Certain individuals, who&s;e
zeal for James over&s;hot their di&s;cretion, formed a de&s;ign
to &s;ei&s;e the per&s;on of King William, and convey him to
France, or put him to death, in ca&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance. They
had &s;ent emi&s;&s;aries to the court of St. Germain's, to de|mand
a commi&s;&s;ion for this purpo&s;e, which was refu&s;ed.
The Earl of Ayle&s;bury, Lord Montgomery, &s;on to the
Marquis of Powis, Sir John Fenwick, Sir John Friend,
Captain Charnock, Captain Porter, and one Mr. Good|man,
were the fir&s;t contrivers of this project. Charnock
was detached with a propo&s;al to James, that he &s;hould
procure a body of hor&s;e and foot from France, to make a
de&s;cent in England, and they would engage not only to
join him at his landing, but even to replace him on the
<PB N="256" REF="260">
throne of England. The&s;e offers being declined by James,
on pretence that the French King could not &s;pare &s;uch a
number of troops at that juncture, the Earl of Ayle&s;bury
went over in per&s;on, and was admitted to a conference
with Louis, in which the &s;cheme of an inva&s;ion was
actually concerted. In the beginning of February, the
Duke of Berwick repaired privately to England, where he
conferred with the con&s;pirators, a&s;&s;ured them that King
James was ready to make a de&s;cent with a con&s;iderable
number of French forces, di&s;tributed commi&s;&s;ions, and
gave directions for providing men, arms, and hor&s;es, to
join him at his arrival. When he returned to France, he
found every thing prepared for the expedition. The
troops were drawn down to the &s;ea-&s;ide: a great number
of tran&s;ports were a&s;&s;embled at Dunkirk: Mon&s;ieur
Gabaret had advanced as far as Calais with a &s;quadron of
&s;hips, which, when joined by that of Du Bart at Dun|kirk,
was judged a &s;ufficient convoy; and James had
come as far as Calais, in his way to embark. Mean
while, the Jacobites in England were a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly employed
in making preparations for a revolt. Sir John Friend had
very near completed a regiment of hor&s;e. Con&s;iderable
progre&s;s was made in levying another by Sir William
Perkins. Sir John Fenwick had enli&s;ted four troops.
Colonel Tempe&s;t had undertaken for one regiment of
dragoons: Colonel Parker was preferred to the command
of another: Mr. Curzon was commi&s;&s;ioned for a third;
and the malcontents intended to rai&s;e a fourth in Suffolk,
where their intere&s;t chiefly prevailed.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. While one part of the Jacobites proceeded
again&s;t William in the u&s;ual way of exciting an in&s;urrec|tion,
another, con&s;i&s;ting of the mo&s;t de&s;perate con&s;pi|rators,
had formed a &s;cheme of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. Sir George
Barclay, a native of Scotland, who had &s;erved as an
officer in the army of James, a man of undaunted
courage, a furious bigot in the religion of Rome, yet
clo&s;e, circum&s;pect, and determined, was landed, with
other officers, in Romney-mar&s;h, by one Captain Gill,
<PB N="257" REF="261">
about the beginning of January, and is &s;aid to have un|dertaken
the ta&s;k of &s;ei&s;ing or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating King William.
He imparted his de&s;ign to Harri&s;on, alias John&s;ton, a
prie&s;t, Charnock, Porter, and William Perkins, by whom
it was approved; and he pretended to have a particular
commi&s;&s;ion for this &s;ervice. After various con&s;ultations,
they re&s;olved to attack the King on his return from
Richmond, where he commonly hunted on Saturdays;
and the &s;cene of their intended ambu&s;cade was a lane
between Brentford and Turnham-green. As it would
be nece&s;&s;ary to charge and di&s;per&s;e the guards that at|tended
the coach, they agreed that their number &s;hould
be increa&s;ed to forty hor&s;emen, and each con&s;pirator be|gan
to engage proper per&s;ons for the enterpri&s;e. When
their complement was full, they determined to execute
their purpo&s;e on the fifteenth day of February. They
concerted the manner in which they &s;hould meet in &s;mall
parties without &s;u&s;picion, and waited with impatience for
the hour of action. In this interval, &s;ome of the under|ling
actors, &s;ei&s;ed with horror at the reflexion of what
they had undertaken, or captivated with the pro&s;pect of
reward, re&s;olved to prevent the execution of the de&s;ign by
a timely di&s;covery. On the eleventh day of February, one
Fi&s;her informed the Earl of Portland of the &s;cheme, and
named &s;ome of the con&s;pirators; but his account was im|perfect.
On the thirteenth, however, he returned with a
circum&s;tantial detail of all the particulars. Next day, the
Earl was acco&s;ted by one Pendergra&s;s, an Iri&s;h officer,
who told his lord&s;hip he had ju&s;t come from Hamp&s;hire,
at the reque&s;t of a particular friend, and under&s;tood that
he had been called up to town with a view of engaging
him in a de&s;ign to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate King William. He &s;aid, he
had promi&s;ed to embark in the undertaking, though
he dete&s;ted it in his own mind, and took this fir&s;t oppor|tunity
of revealing the &s;ecret, which was of &s;uch con&s;e|quence
to his Maje&s;ty's life. He owned him&s;elf a Roman
catholick, but declared, that he did not think any reli|gion
could ju&s;tify &s;uch a treacherous purpo&s;e. At the
<PB N="258" REF="262">
&s;ame time he ob&s;erved, that as he lay under obligations
to &s;ome of the con&s;pirators, his honour and gratitude
would not permit him to accu&s;e them by name; and that
he would upon no con&s;ideration appear as an evidence.
The King had been &s;o much u&s;ed to fictitious plots, and
fal&s;e di&s;coveries, that he paid little regard to the&s;e infor|mations,
until they were confirmed by the te&s;timony of ano|ther
con&s;pirator called La Rue, a Frenchman, who commu|nicated
the &s;ame particulars to Brigadier Levi&s;on, without
knowing the lea&s;t circum&s;tance of the other di&s;coveries.
Then the King believed there was &s;omething real in the con|&s;piracy;
and Pendergra&s;s and La Rue were &s;everally ex|amined
in his pre&s;ence. He thanked Pendergra&s;s in par|ticular
for this in&s;tance of his probity; but ob&s;erved,
that it mu&s;t prove ineffectual, unle&s;s he would di&s;cover
the names of the con&s;pirators; for, without knowing who
they were, he &s;hould not be able to &s;ecure his life
again&s;t their attempts. At length Pendergra&s;s was pre|vailed
upon to give a li&s;t of tho&s;e he knew, yet not be|fore
the King had &s;olemnly promi&s;ed that he &s;hould not
be u&s;ed as an evidence again&s;t them, except with his own
con&s;ent. As the King did not go to Richmond on the
day appointed, the con&s;pirators po&s;tponed the execution
of their de&s;ign till the Saturday following. They accord|ingly
met at different hou&s;es on the Friday, when every
man received his in&s;tructions. There they agreed, that
after the perpetration of the parricide, they &s;hould ride in
a body as far as Hammer&s;mith, and then di&s;per&s;ing, enter
London by different avenues. But, on the morning,
when they under&s;tood that the guards were returned to
their quarters, and the King's coaches &s;ent back to the
Mews, they were &s;ei&s;ed with a &s;udden damp, on the &s;up|po&s;ition
that their plot was di&s;covered. Sir George
Barclay withdrew him&s;elf, and every one began to think
of providing for his own &s;afety. Next night, however, a
great number of them were apprehended, and then the
whole di&s;covery was communicated to the privy-coun|cil.
A proclamation was i&s;&s;ued again&s;t tho&s;e that ab|&s;conded;
<PB N="259" REF="263">
and great diligence was u&s;ed to find Sir George
Barclay, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have a particular commi&s;|&s;ion
from James for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the Prince of Orange:
but he made good his retreat, and it was never proved
that any &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion had been granted.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. This de&s;ign and the projected inva&s;ion
proved equally abortive. James had &s;carce reached Calais,
when the Duke of Wirtemberg di&s;patched his alde-de-camp
from Flanders to King William, with an account
of the purpo&s;ed de&s;cent. Expre&s;&s;es with the &s;ame tidings
arrived from the Elector of Bavaria and the Prince de
Vaudemont. Two con&s;iderable &s;quadrons being ready
for &s;ea, Admiral Ru&s;&s;el embarked at Spithead, and &s;tood
over to the French coa&s;t with above fifty &s;ail of the line.
The enemy were confounded at his appearance, and
hauled in their ve&s;&s;els under the &s;hore, in &s;uch &s;hallow
water that he could not follow and de&s;troy them: but he
ab&s;olutely ruined their de&s;ign, by cooping them up in
their harbours. King James, after having tarried &s;ome
weeks at Calais, returned to St. Germain's. The forces
were &s;ent back to their garri&s;ons from which they had
been drafted: the people of France exclaimed, that the
malignant &s;tar which ruled the de&s;tiny of James had bla&s;t|ed
this, and every other project formed for his re&s;tora|tion.
By means of the reward offered in the proclamation,
the greater part of the con&s;pirators were betrayed or ta|ken.
George Harris, who had been &s;ent from France, with
orders to obey Sir George Barclay, &s;urrendered him&s;elf to
Sir William Trumball, and confe&s;&s;ed the &s;cheme of a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ination
in which he had been engaged. Porter and Pen|dergra&s;s
were apprehended together. This la&s;t in&s;i&s;ted up|on
the King's promi&s;e, that he &s;hould not be compelled
to give evidence: but, when Porter owned him&s;elf guilty,
the other ob&s;erved, he was no longer bound to be &s;ilent,
as his friend had made a confe&s;&s;ion; and they were both
admitted as evidences for the crown.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. After their examination, the King, in a &s;peech
to both Hou&s;es, communicated the nature of the con&s;pi|racy
<PB N="260" REF="264">
again&s;t his life, as well as the advices he had received
touching the inva&s;ion: he explained the &s;teps he had ta|ken
to defeat the double de&s;ign, and profe&s;&s;ed his con|fidence
in their readine&s;s and zeal to concur with him in
every thing that &s;hould appear nece&s;&s;ary for their com|mon
&s;afety. That &s;ame evening the two Hou&s;es waited
upon him at Ken&s;ington, in a body, with an affectionate
addre&s;s, by which they expre&s;&s;ed their abhorrence of the
villainous and barbarous de&s;ign which had been formed
again&s;t his &s;acred per&s;on, of which they be&s;ought him to
take more than ordinary care. They a&s;&s;ured him they
would to their utmo&s;t defend his life, and &s;upport his go|vernment
again&s;t the late King James, and all other ene|mies;
and declared, that in ca&s;e his Maje&s;ty &s;hould come
to a violent death, they would revenge it upon his adver|&s;aries
and their adherents. He was extremely well plea&s;ed
with this warm addre&s;s, and a&s;&s;ured them, in his turn, he
would take all opportunities of recommending him&s;elf to
the continuance of their loyalty and affection. The
Commons forthwith empowered him, by bill, to &s;ecure
all per&s;ons &s;u&s;pected of con&s;piring again&s;t his per&s;on and
government. They brought in another, providing, That
in ca&s;e of his Maje&s;ty's death, the parliament then in be|ing
&s;hould continue until di&s;&s;olved by the next heir in
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, e&s;tabli&s;hed by act of parliament:
that if his Maje&s;ty &s;hould chance to die between two
parliaments, that which had been la&s;t di&s;&s;olved, &s;hould
immediately re-a&s;&s;emble, and &s;it for the di&s;patch of na|tional
affairs. They voted an addre&s;s, to de&s;ire, That his
Maje&s;ty would bani&s;h by proclamation, all papi&s;ts to the
di&s;tance of ten miles from the cities of London and
We&s;tmin&s;ter; and give in&s;tructions to the judges going
on the circuits, to put the laws in execution again&s;t Ro|man
catholicks and nonjurors. They drew up an a&s;&s;ocia|tion,
binding them&s;elves to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in &s;upport
of the King and his government; and to revenge any
violence that &s;hould be committed on his per&s;on. This
was &s;igned by all the members then pre&s;ent; but, as
<PB N="261" REF="265">
&s;ome had ab&s;ented them&s;elves on frivolous pretences, the
Hou&s;e ordered, That in &s;ixteen days the ab&s;entees &s;hould
either &s;ub&s;cribe, or declare their refu&s;al. Several members
neglecting to comply with this injunction within the
limited time, the Speaker was ordered to write to tho&s;e
who were in the country, and demand a peremptory an|&s;wer;
and the clerk of the Hou&s;e attended &s;uch as pre|tended
to be ill in town. The ab&s;entees, finding them|&s;elves
pre&s;&s;ed in this manner, thought proper to &s;ail with
the &s;tream, and &s;ign the a&s;&s;ociation, which was pre&s;ented
to the King by the Commons in a body, with a reque&s;t,
that it might be lodged among the records in the Tower,
as a perpetual memorial of their loyalty and affection.
The King received them with uncommon complacency;
declared, that he heartily entered into the &s;ame a&s;&s;ocia|tion;
that he &s;hould be always ready to venture his life
with his good &s;ubjects, again&s;t all who &s;hould endeavour
to &s;ubvert the religion, laws, and liberties of England;
and he promi&s;ed that this, and all other a&s;&s;ociations,
&s;hould be lodged among the records in the Tower of
London. Next day the Commons re&s;olved, That who|ever
&s;hould affirm an a&s;&s;ociation was illegal &s;hould be
deemed a promoter of the de&s;igns of the late King James,
and an enemy to the laws and liberties of the kingdom.
The Lords followed the example of the Lower Hou&s;e in
drawing up an a&s;&s;ociation; but the Earl of Nottingham,
Sir Edward Seymour, and Mr. Finch, objected to the
words Rightful and Lawful, as applied to his Maje&s;ty.
They &s;aid, as the crown and its prerogatives were ve&s;ted
in him, they would yield obedience, though they could
not acknowledge him as their rightful and lawful King.
Nothing could be more ab&s;urd than this di&s;tinction &s;tarted
by men who had actually con&s;tituted part of the admi|ni&s;tration;
unle&s;s they &s;uppo&s;ed that the right of King
William expired with Queen Mary. The Earl of Ro|che&s;ter
propo&s;ed an expedient in favour of &s;uch tender
con&s;ciences, by altering the words that gave offence; and
this was adopted accordingly. Fifteen of the peers, and
<PB N="262" REF="266">
ninety-two commoners &s;igned the a&s;&s;ociation with re|luctance.
It was, however, &s;ub&s;cribed by all &s;orts of
people in different parts of the kingdom; and the bi&s;hops
drew up a form for the clergy, which was &s;igned by a
great majority.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet Oldmixon. Boyer. Tindal. Ralph. Lives of the Admirals.</NOTE> The Commons brought in a bill, declar|ing
all men incapable of public tru&s;t, or of &s;itting in par|liament,
who would not engage in this a&s;&s;ociation. At
the &s;ame time, the council i&s;&s;ued an order for renewing
all the commi&s;&s;ions in England, that tho&s;e who had not
&s;igned it voluntarily &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the &s;ervice
as di&s;affected per&s;ons.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. After the&s;e warm demon&s;trations of loyalty,
the Commons proceeded upon ways and means for rai&s;ing
the &s;upplies. A new bank was con&s;tituted as a fund, upon
which the &s;um of two millions, five hundred and &s;ixty-|four
thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be rai&s;ed; and it was called
the Land Bank, becau&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed on land &s;ecurities.
This &s;cheme,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. 1696.</NOTE> &s;aid to have been projected by the famous
Doctor Chamberlain, was patroni&s;ed by the Earl of Sun|derland,
and managed by Foley and Harley: &s;o that it
&s;eemed to be a Tory plan, which Sunderland &s;upported,
in order to reconcile him&s;elf to that party.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The Commons re&s;olved, That a fund redeemable by parliament be &s;ettled in a national land bank, to be rai&s;ed by new &s;ub&s;criptions: That no per&s;on be concerned in both banks at the &s;ame time: That the duties upon coa$, culm, and tonnage of &s;hips, be taken off, from the &s;eventeenth day of March: That the &s;um of two millions, five hundred and &s;ixty-four thou&s;and pounds be rai&s;ed on this perpetual fund, redeemable by parliament: That the new bank &s;hould be re&s;trained from lending money but upon land &s;ecuriti$$, or to the government in the Exchequer: That for making up the fund of in|tere&s;t for the capital &s;$ock, certain duties upon gla&s;$-wa$es, &s;tone, and ea$ then bottles, granted before to the King for a term of years, be continued to h$$ Maje&s;ty, his heirs, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors: That a further duty be laid upon &s;tone and earthen ware, and another upon tobacco pipes. This bank was to lend out five hundred thou&s;and pounds a-year upon land-&s;ecurities, at three pounds ten &s;hillings per cent. per annum, and to cea&s;e and determine, unle&s;s the &s;ub|&s;cription &s;hould be full by the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t next en&s;uing.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable laws enacted in this &s;e&s;&s;ion were the&s;e: An act for voiding all the elections of parliament men, at which the elected had been at any expen&s;e in meat, drink, or money, to procure votes. Another again&s;t unlawful and double returns. A third, for the more ea&s;y recovery of &s;mall $i$hes. A fourth, $o prevent marriages, without licence or banns. A fifth, for enabling the inhabitants of Wales to di&s;po&s;e of all their per&s;onal e&s;tates as they &s;hould think fit. This law was in bar of a cu&s;tom that had prevailed in that country. The widows and younger children claimed a &s;hare of the effects, called their Rea&s;onable part, although the effects had been other|wi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed of by wi$l or deed. The parliament likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed an act, for preventing the exportation of wool, and encouraging the importation thereof from Ireland. An act for encouraging the linen manufactures of Ire|land. An act for regulating injuries. An act for encouraging the Greenland trade. An act for indu$gence to the quakers, that their &s;olemn affirmation &s;hould be accepted in&s;tead of an oath. And an act for continuing certain other acts that were near expiring. Another bill had pa&s;&s;ed for the better regulating elections for members of parliament; but the royal a&s;&s;ent was de|nied. The que&s;tion was put in the Hou&s;e of Commons, That who&s;oever ad|vi&s;ed his Maje&s;ty not to give his a&s;&s;ent to that bill was an enemy to his coun|try; but it was rejected by a great majority.</P></NOTE> The Bank
<PB N="263" REF="267">
of England petitioned again&s;t this bill, and were heard by
their coun&s;el: but their repre&s;entations produced no effect,
and the bill having pa&s;&s;ed through both Hou&s;es, received
the royal a&s;&s;ent. On the twenty-&s;eventh day of April the
King clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a &s;hort but gracious &s;peech;
and the parliament was prorogued to the &s;ixteenth day of
June.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. Before this period &s;ome of the con&s;pirators had
been brought to trial. The fir&s;t who &s;uffered was Robert
Charnock, one of the two fellows of Magdalen college,
who, in the reign of James, had renounced the prote&s;tant
religion: the next were Lieutenant King, and Thomas
Keys, which la&s;t had been formerly a trumpeter, but of
late &s;ervant to Captain Porter. They were found guilty
of high trea&s;on, and executed at Tyburn. They delivered
papers to the Sheriff, in which they &s;olemnly declared,
that they had never &s;een or heard of any commi&s;&s;ion from
King James for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating the Prince of Orange: Char|nock,
in particular, ob&s;erved, that he had received frequent
a&s;&s;urances of the King's having rejected &s;uch propo&s;als
when they had been offered; and that there was no other
commi&s;&s;ion but that for levying war in the u&s;ual form. Sir
John Friend and Sir William Perkins were tried in April.
The fir&s;t from mean beginnings had acquired great wealth
and credit, and always firmly adhered to the intere&s;ts of
King James. The other was likewi&s;e a man of fortune,
<PB N="264" REF="268">
violently attached to the &s;ame principles, though he had
taken the oaths to the pre&s;ent government, as one of the
&s;ix clerks in Chancery. Porter and Blair, another evidence,
depo&s;ed, that Sir John Friend had been concerned in levy|ing
men under a commi&s;&s;ion from King James; and that
he knew of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination plot, though not engaged in it
as a per&s;onal actor. He endeavoured to invalidate the
te&s;timony of Blair, by proving him guilty of the mo&s;t
&s;hocking ingratitude. He ob&s;erved, that both the evidences
were reputed papi&s;ts. The curate of Hackney, who offi|ciated
as chaplain in the pri&s;oner's hou&s;e, declared upon
oath, that after the Revolution he u&s;ed to pray for King
William; and that he had often heard Sir John Friend
&s;ay, that though he could not comply with the pre&s;ent
government, he would live peaceably under it, and never
engage in any con&s;piracy. Mr. Hoadly, father of the
pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, added, that the pri&s;oner
was a good prote&s;tant, and frequently expre&s;&s;ed his dete&s;t|ation
of king-killing principles. Friend him&s;elf owned
he had been with &s;ome of the con&s;pirators at a meeting
in Leadenhall-&s;treet, but heard nothing of rai&s;ing men,
or any de&s;ign again&s;t the government. He likewi&s;e
affirmed that a con&s;ultation to levy war was not trea&s;on;
and that his being at a trea&s;onable con&s;ult could amount
to no more than a mi&s;pri&s;ion of trea&s;on. Lord-Chief-Ju&s;tice
Holt declared, that although a bare con&s;piracy, or
de&s;ign to levy war, was not trea&s;on within the &s;tatute of
Edward III. yet, if the de&s;ign or con&s;piracy be to kill, or
depo&s;e, or impri&s;on the king, by the means of levying war,
then the con&s;ultation and con&s;piracy to levy war becomes
high-trea&s;on, though no war be actually levied. The &s;ame
inference might have been drawn again&s;t the authors and
in&s;truments of the Revolution. The judge's explanation
influenced the jury, who after &s;ome deliberation found the
pri&s;oner guilty. Next day Sir William Perkins was brought
to the bar, and upon the te&s;timony of Porter, Ewebank
his own groom, and Haywood, a notorious informer, was
convicted of having been concerned, not only in the in|va&s;ion,

but al&s;o in the de&s;ign again&s;t the King's life. The
evidence was &s;canty, and the pri&s;oner having being bred to
the law, made an artful and vigorous defence: but the
judge acted as council for the crown; and the jury decided
by the hints they received from the bench. He and Sir
John Friend underwent the &s;entence of death, and &s;uffered
at Tyburn on the third day of April. Friend prote&s;ted
before God, that he knew of no immediate de&s;cent pur|po&s;ed
by King James, and therefore had made no prepa|rations:
that he was utterly ignorant of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination
&s;cheme: that he died in the communion of the church of
England, and laid down his life chearfully in the cau&s;e
for which he &s;uffered. Perkins declared, upon the word
of a dying man, that the tenour of the King's commi&s;&s;ion
which he &s;aw, was general, directed to all his loving &s;ub|jects,
to rai&s;e and levy war again&s;t the Prince of Orange
and his adherents, and to &s;ei&s;e all forts, ca&s;tles, &amp;c. but
that he neither &s;aw nor heard of any commi&s;&s;ion particu|larly
levelled again&s;t the per&s;on of the Prince of Orange.
He owned, however, that he was privy to the de&s;ign: but
believed it was known to few or none but the immediate
undertakers. The&s;e two criminals were in their la&s;t mo|ments
attended by Collier, Snatt, and Cook, three non|juring
clergymen, who ab&s;olved them in the view of the
populace, with an impo&s;ition of hands: a publick in&s;ult
on the government which did not pa&s;s unnoticed. Tho&s;e
three clergymen were pre&s;ented by the grand-jury, for
having countenanced the trea&s;on by ab&s;olving the traitors,
and thereby encouraged other per&s;ons to di&s;turb the peace
of the kingdom. An indictment being preferred again&s;t
them, Cook and Snatt were commited to Newgate: but,
Collier ab&s;conded, and publi&s;hed a vindication of their con|duct,
in which he affirmed, that the impo&s;ition of hands
was the general practice of the primitive church. On the
other hand, the two metropolitans, and twelve other bi|&s;hops
&s;ub&s;cribed a declaration, condemning the admini|&s;tration
of ab&s;olution without a previous confe&s;&s;ion made,
and abhorrence expre&s;&s;ed by the pri&s;oners of the heinous
<PB N="266" REF="270">
crimes for which they &s;uffered. In the cour&s;e of the &s;ame
month, Rookwood, Cranborne, and Lowick, were tried
as con&s;pirators, by a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion, in the King's
Bench; and convicted on the joint te&s;timony of Porter,
Harris, La Rue, Bertram, Fi&s;her, and Pendergra&s;s. Some
favourable circum&s;tances appeared in the ca&s;e of Lowick.
The proof of his having been concerned in the de&s;ign
again&s;t the King's life was very defective: many per&s;ons
of reputation declared he was an hone&s;t, good-natured, in-offen&s;ive
man: and he him&s;elf concluded his defence with
the mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;tation of his own innocence. Great
interce&s;&s;ion was made for his pardon by &s;ome noblemen:
but all their intere&s;t proved ineffectual. Cranborne died
in a tran&s;port of indignation, leaving a paper, which the
government thought proper to &s;uppre&s;s. Lowick and
Rookwood likewi&s;e delivered declarations to the &s;heriff,
the contents of which, as being le&s;s inflammatory, were
allowed to be publi&s;hed. Both &s;olemnly denied any know|ledge
of a commi&s;&s;ion from King James, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the
Prince of Orange: the one affirming, that he was incapa|ble
of granting &s;uch an order; and the other a&s;&s;erting that
he, the be&s;t of kings, had often rejected propo&s;als of that
nature. Lowick owned that he would have joined the
King at his landing: but declared, he had never been
concerned in any bloody affair during the whole cour&s;e of
his life. On the contrary, he &s;aid, he had endeavoured to
prevent blood&s;hed as much as lay in his power; and that
he would not kill the mo&s;t mi&s;erable creature in the world,
even though &s;uch an act would &s;ave his life, re&s;tore his
&s;overeign, and make him one of the greate&s;t men in En|gland.
Rookwood alledged, he was engaged by his im|mediate
commander, whom he thought it was his duty to
obey, though the &s;ervice was much again&s;t his judgement
and inclination. He profe&s;&s;ed his abhorrence of treachery
even to an enemy. He forgave all mankind, even the
Prince of Orange, who, as a &s;oldier, he &s;aid, ought to
have con&s;idered his ca&s;e before he &s;igned his death warrant:
he prayed God would open his eyes, and render him
<PB N="267" REF="271">
$en&s;ible of the blood that was from all parts crying again&s;t
$im, &s;o as he might avert a heavier execution than that
which he now ordered to be inflicted. The next per&s;on
brought to trial, was Mr. Cooke, &s;on of Sir Miles Cooke,
$ne of the &s;ix clerks in Chancery. Porter and Goodman
depo&s;ed, that he had been pre&s;ent at two meetings at the
King's-head tavern in Leadenhall-&s;treet with the Lords
Ayle&s;bury and Montgomery, Sir William Perkins, Sir John
Fenwick, Sir John Friend, Charnock and Porter. The
evidence of Goodman was invalidated by the te&s;timony of
the landlord and two drawers belonging to the tavern, who
&s;wore that Goodman was not there while the noblemen were
pre&s;ent. The pri&s;oner him&s;elf &s;olemnly prote&s;ted that he was
ever aver&s;e to the introduction of foreign forces: that he did
not &s;o much as hear of the intended inva&s;ion, until it be|came
the common topick of conver&s;ation; and that he
had never &s;een Goodman at the King's-head. He declared
his intention of receiving the ble&s;&s;ed &s;acrament, and wi&s;hed
he might peri&s;h in the in&s;tant, if he now &s;poke untruth.
No re&s;pect was paid to the&s;e a&s;&s;everations. The Solli|citor-General
Hawles, and Lord-Chief-Ju&s;tice Treby,
treated him with great &s;everity in the pro&s;ecution and charge
to the jury, by whom he was capitally convicted. After
his condemnation the court-agents tampered with him to
make further di&s;coveries; and after his fate had been
protracted by divers &s;hort reprieves, he was &s;ent into
bani&s;hment. From the whole tenour of the&s;e di&s;coveries
and proceedings, it appears that James had actually me|ditated
an inva&s;ion: that his parti&s;ans in England had made
preparations for joining him on his arrival, that a few
de&s;peradoes of that faction had concerted a &s;cheme again&s;t
the life of King William: that in pro&s;ecuting the con|&s;pirators
the court had countenanced informers: that the
judges had &s;trained the law, wre&s;ted circum&s;tances, and
even deviated from the function of their office, to convict
the pri&s;oners: in a word, that the admini&s;tration had u&s;ed
the &s;ame arbitrary and unfair practices again&s;t tho&s;e un|happy
<PB N="268" REF="272">
people, which they them&s;elves had in the late reigns
numbered among the grievances of the kingdom.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. The warmth, however, manife&s;ted on this
occa&s;ion may have been owing to national re&s;entment of
the purpo&s;ed inva&s;ion. Certain it is, the two Hou&s;es of
parliament, and the people in general, were animated with
extraordinary indignation again&s;t France at this juncture.
The Lords be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty, in a &s;olemn addre&s;s,
to appoint a day of thank&s;giving to Almighty God,
for having defeated the barbarous purpo&s;e of his ene|mies;
and this was ob&s;erved with uncommon zeal and de|votion.
Admiral Ru&s;&s;el leaving a &s;quadron for ob&s;erva|tion
on the French coa&s;t, returned to the Downs: but
Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel being properly prepared for the ex|pedition,
&s;ubjected Calais to another bombardment, by
which the town was &s;et on fire in different parts, and the
inhabitants were overwhelmed with con&s;ternation. The
generals of the allied army in Flanders re&s;olved to make &s;ome
immediate retaliation upon the French for their unmanly
de&s;ign upon the life of King William, as they took it for
granted that Louis was acce&s;&s;ory to the &s;cheme of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nation.
That monarch, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that a power|ful
diver&s;ion would be made by the de&s;cent on England,
had e&s;tabli&s;hed a va&s;t magazine at Givet, de&s;igning, when
the allies &s;hould be enfeebled by the ab&s;ence of the Briti&s;h
troops, to &s;trike &s;ome &s;troke of importance early in the
campaign. On this the confederates now determined to
wreak their vengeance. In the beginning of March the
Earl of Athlone and Mon&s;ieur de Coehorn, with the con|currence
of the Duke of Hol&s;tein-Ploen, who commanded
the allies, &s;ent a &s;trong detachment of hor&s;e, drafted from
Bru&s;&s;els and the neighbouring garri&s;ons, to amu&s;e the
enemy on the &s;ide of Charleroy; while they a&s;&s;embled
forty &s;quadrons, thirty battalions, with fifteen pieces of
cannon, and &s;ix mortars, in the territory of Namur.
Athlone with part of this body inve&s;ted Dinant, while
Coehorn, with the remainder, advanced to Givet. He
<PB N="269" REF="273">
s$orthwith began to batter and bombard the place, which
$ three hours was on fire, and by four in the afternoon
$holly de&s;troyed, with the great magazine it contained.
$hen the two generals joining their forces, returned to
$amur without interruption. Hitherto the republick of
$enice had deferred acknowledging King William: but
$ow they &s;ent an extraordinary emba&s;&s;y for that purpo&s;e,
$on&s;i&s;ting of Signiors Soranzo and Venier, who arrived in
$ondon, and on the fir&s;t day of May had a publick au|$ience.
The King, on this occa&s;ion, knighted Soranzo as
$he &s;enior amba&s;&s;ador, and pre&s;ented him with the &s;word,
$ccording to cu&s;tom. On that day, too, William declared
$ council, that he had appointed the &s;ame regency which
$ad governed the kingdom during his la&s;t ab&s;ence; and
$mbarking on the &s;eventh at Margate, arrived at Orange|$older
in the evening, under convoy of Vice-Admiral
$ylmer. This officer had been ordered to attend with a
$quadron, as the famous Du Bart &s;till continued at Dun|$irk,
and &s;ome attempt of importance was apprehended
$rom his enterpri&s;ing genius<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Some promotions were made before the King left England. George $amilton, third &s;on of the duke of that name, was, for his military &s;ervice$ $word$ Ireland and Flanders, created Earl of Orkney. Sir John Lowther was en|$obled by the title of Baron Lowther, and Vi&s;count Lon&s;dale; Sir John Thom&s;on made Baron of Haver&s;ham, and the celebrated John Lo$ke appoint|$d one of the commi&s;&s;ioners of Trade and Plantations.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. The French had taken the field before the
$llied army could be a&s;&s;embled: but no tran&s;action of
$on&s;equence di&s;tingui&s;hed this campaign, either upon the
$hine or in Flanders. The &s;cheme of Louis was &s;till de|$en&s;ive
on the &s;ide of the Netherlands, while the active
$lans of King William were defeated by want of money.
All the funds for this year proved defective: the land|$ank
failed, and the national bank &s;u&s;tained a rude &s;hock
$n its credit. The lo&s;s of the nation upon the recoinage
$mounted to two millions, two hundred thou&s;and pounds;
$nd though the different mints were employed without
$nterruption, they could not for &s;ome months &s;upply the
<PB N="270" REF="274">
circulation, e&s;pecially as great part of the new money was
kept up by tho&s;e who received it in payment, or di&s;po&s;ed
of at an unrea&s;onable advantage. The French King
having exhau&s;ted the wealth and patience of his &s;ubjects,
and greatly dimini&s;hed their number in the cour&s;e of this
war, began to be diffident of his arms, and employed all
the arts of private negociation. While his mini&s;ter
D'Avaux pre&s;&s;ed the King of Sweden to offer his media|tion,
he &s;ent Callieres to Holland, with propo&s;als for
&s;ettling the preliminaries of a treaty. He took it for
granted, that as the Dutch were a trading people, who&s;e
commerce had greatly &s;uffered in the war, they could not
be aver&s;e to a pacification; and he in&s;tructed his emi&s;&s;a|ries
to tamper with the malcontents of the republick,
e&s;pecially with the remains of the Louve&s;tein faction,
which had always oppo&s;ed the &s;chemes of the Stadtholder.
Callieres met with a favourable reception from the States,
which began to treat with him about the preliminaries&punc;
though not without the con&s;ent and concurrence of King
William and the re&s;t of the allies. Louis, with a view
to quicken the effect of this negociation, pur&s;ued offen&s;ive
mea&s;ures in Catalonia, where his general, the Duke d$
Vendome attacked and wor&s;ted the Spaniards in thei
camp near O&s;talrick, though the action was not deci&s;ive$
for that General was obliged to retreat, after having made
vigorous efforts again&s;t their entrenchments. On the
twentieth day of June, Mare&s;chal de Lorges pa&s;&s;ed th$
Rhine at Philip&s;burgh, and encamped within a league o$
Eppingen, where the Imperial troops were obliged to
entrench them&s;elves, under the command of the Prince
of Baden, as they were not yet joined by the auxiliary
forces. The French general after having faced hi$$
about a month, thought proper to repa&s;s the river. The$$
he detached a body of hor&s;e to Flanders, and cantone$
the re&s;t of his troops at Spires, Franckendab$. Worms
and O&s;tofen. On the la&s;t day of Augu&s;t the Prince o$
Baden retaliated the in&s;ult, by pa&s;&s;ing the Rhine a$
Mentz and Coc&s;heim. On the tenth he was joined by
<PB N="271" REF="275">
General Thungen, who commanded a &s;eparate body,
together with the militia of Suabia and Franconia, and
advanced to the camp of the enemy, who had rea&s;&s;embled:
but they were po&s;ted in &s;uch a manner, that he would
not hazard an attack. Having, therefore, cannonaded
them for &s;ome days, &s;coured the adjacent country by de|tached
parties, and taken the little ca&s;tle of Wiezengen,
he repa&s;&s;ed the river at Worms, on the &s;eventh day of
October: the French likewi&s;e cro&s;&s;ed at Philip&s;burgh, in
hopes of &s;urpri&s;ing General Thungen, who had taken po&s;t
in the neighbourhood of Stra&s;bourg: but he retired to
Eppingen before their arrival, and in a little time both
armies were di&s;tributed in winter quarters. Peter, the
Czar of Mu&s;covy, carried on the &s;iege of Azoph with &s;uch
vigour, that the garri&s;on was obliged to capitulate, after
the Ru&s;&s;ians had defeated a great convoy &s;ent to its relief.
The court of Vienna forthwith engaged in an alliance
with the Mu&s;covite emperor: but, they did not exert
them&s;elves in taking advantage of the di&s;a&s;ter which the
Turks had undergone. The Imperial army, commanded
by the Elector of Saxony, continued inactive on the river
Maro&s;ch till the nineteenth day of July, then they made
a feint of attacking Temi&s;waer: but they marched to|wards
Betzkerch, in their route to Belgrade, on receiving
advice that the Grand Signor intended to be&s;iege Titul.
On the twenty-fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t the two armies were in
&s;ight of each other. The Turki&s;h hor&s;e attacked the
Imperiali&s;ts in a plain near the river Begue; but were
repul&s;ed. The Germans next day made a &s;how of re|treating,
in hopes of drawing the enemy from their en|trenchments.
The &s;tratagem &s;ucceeded. On the twenty|&s;ixth,
the Turki&s;h army was in motion. A detachment
of the Imperiali&s;ts attacked them in flank, as they marched
through a wood. A very de&s;perate action en&s;ued, in
which the Generals Heu&s;ler and Poland, with many other
gallant officers, lo&s;t their lives. At length, the Ottoman
hor&s;e were routed: but the Germans were &s;o roughly
handled, that on the &s;econd day after the engagement
<PB N="272" REF="276">
they retreated at midnight, and the Turks remained quie$
in their entrenchments.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. In Piedmont the face of affairs underwent a
&s;trange alteration. The Duke of Savoy, who had for
&s;ome time been engaged in a &s;ecret negociation with
France, at length embraced the offers of that crown, and
privately &s;igned a &s;eparate treaty of peace at Loretto, to
which place he repaired on a pretended pilgrimage. The
French King engaged to pre&s;ent him with four millions
of livres, by way of reparation for the damage he had
&s;u&s;tained; to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with a certain number of auxilia|ries
again&s;t all his enemies; and to effect a marriage be|tween
the Duke of Burgundy and the Prince&s;s of Pied|mont,
as &s;oon as the parties &s;hould be marriageable. The
treaty was guarantied by the Pope and the Venetians, who
were extremely de&s;irous of &s;eeing the Germans driven out
of Italy. King William being appri&s;ed of this negocia|tion,
communicated the intelligence to the Earl of Gal|way,
his amba&s;&s;ador at Turin, who expo&s;tulated with the
Duke upon his defection: but he per&s;i&s;ted in denying any
&s;uch corre&s;pondence, until the advance of the French
army enabled him to avow it without fearing the re&s;ent|ment
of the allies whom he had abandoned. Catinat
marched into the plains of Turin, at the head of fifty
thou&s;and men; an army greatly &s;uperior to that of the
confederates. Then the Duke imparted to the mini&s;ters
of the allies the propo&s;als which France had made; re|pre&s;ented
the &s;uperior &s;trength of her army; the danger to
which he was expo&s;ed; and finally his inclination to em|brace
her offers. On the twelfth of July a truce was
concluded for a month, and afterwards prolonged till the
fifteenth of September. He wrote to all the powers en|gaged
in the confederacy, except King William, expa|tiating
on the &s;ame topics, and &s;olliciting their con&s;ent.
Though each in particular refu&s;ed to concur, he on the
twenty-third day of Augu&s;t &s;igned the treaty in publick,
which he had before concluded in private. The Emperor
was no &s;ooner informed of his de&s;ign, then he took every
<PB N="273" REF="277">
&s;tep which he thought could divert him from his purpo&s;e.
He &s;ent the Count Mansfeldt to Turin, with propo&s;als
for a match between the King of the Romans and the
Prince&s;s of Savoy, as well as with offers to augment his
forces and his &s;ub&s;idy: but the Duke had already &s;ettled
his terms with France, from which he would not recede.
Prince Eugene, though his kin&s;man, expre&s;&s;ed great indig|nation
at his conduct. The young Prince de Commercy
was &s;o provoked at his defection, that he challenged him
to &s;ingle combat, and the Duke accepted of his challenge:
but the quarrel was compromi&s;ed by the intervention of
friends, and they parted in an amicable manner. He had
concealed the treaty until he &s;hould receive the remaining
part of the &s;ub&s;idies due to him from the confederates. A
con&s;iderable &s;um had been remitted from England to Genoa
for his u&s;e: but Lord Galway no &s;ooner received intima|tion
of his new engagement, than he put a &s;top to the
payment of this money, which he employed in the Mila|ne&s;e,
for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of tho&s;e troops that were in the
Briti&s;h &s;ervice. King William was encamped at Gem|blours
when the Duke's envoy notified the &s;eparate peace
which his ma&s;ter had concluded with the King of France.
Though he was extremely chagrined at the information,
he di&s;&s;embled his anger, and li&s;tened to the mini&s;ter with|out
the lea&s;t emotion. One of the conditions of this treaty
was, That within a limited time the allies &s;hould evacuate
the Duke's dominions, otherwi&s;e they &s;hould be expelled
by the joint forces of France and Savoy. A neutrality
was offered to the confederates; and this being rejected,
the contracting powers re&s;olved to attack the Milane&s;e.
Accordingly, when the truce expired, the Duke, as gene|rali&s;&s;imo
of the French King, entered that duchy, and
undertook the &s;iege of Valentia; &s;o that, in one cam|paign,
he commanded two contending armies. The
garri&s;on of Valentia, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;even thou&s;and men,
Germans, Spaniards, and French prote&s;tants, made an
ob&s;tinate defence; and the Duke of Savoy pro&s;ecuted the
&s;iege with uncommon impetuo&s;ity. But, after the trenches
<PB N="274" REF="278">
had been open for thirteen days, a courier arrived from
Madrid, with an account of his Catholick Maje&s;ty's hav|ing
agreed to the neutrality for Italy. This agreement
imported, That there &s;hould be a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms
until a general peace could be effected; and, That the
Imperial and French troops &s;hould return to their re|&s;pective
countries. Chri&s;tendom had well nigh been em|broiled
anew by the death of John Sobie&s;ki King of Po|land,
who died at the age of &s;eventy, in the cour&s;e of this
&s;ummer, after having &s;urvived his faculties and reputa|tion.
As the crown was elective, a competition aro&s;e for
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The kingdom was divided by factions;
and the different powers in Europe intere&s;ted them&s;elves
warmly in the contention.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. Nothing of con&s;equence had been lately
atchieved by the naval force of England. When the
con&s;piracy was fir&s;t di&s;covered, Sir George Rooke had
received orders to return from Cadix; and he arrived in
the latter end of April. While he took his place at the
board of Admiralty, Lord Berkeley &s;ucceeded to the com|mand
of the fleet; and in the month of June &s;et &s;ail to|wards
U&s;hant, in order to in&s;ult the coa&s;t of France. He
pillaged and burned the villages on the i&s;lands Grouais,
Houat, and Heydic; made prize of about twenty ve&s;&s;els;
bombarded St. Martin's on the i&s;le of Rhe, and the town
of Olonne, which was &s;et on fire in fifteen different places
with the &s;hells and carca&s;&s;es. Though the&s;e appear to
have been enterpri&s;es of &s;mall import, they certainly kept
the whole coa&s;t of France in perpetual alarm. The mi|ni&s;try
of that kingdom were &s;o much afraid of inva&s;ion,
that between Bre&s;t and Goulet they ordered above one
hundred batteries to be erected, and above &s;ixty thou&s;and
men were continually in arms, for the defence of the mari|time
places. In the month of May Rear-Admiral Benbow
&s;ailed with a &s;mall &s;quadron, in order to block up Du
Bart in the harbour of Dunkirk: but that famous ad|venturer
found means to e&s;cape in a fog, and &s;teering to
the ea&s;tward, attacked the Dutch fleet in the Baltick,
<PB N="275" REF="279">
under a convoy of five frigates. The&s;e la&s;t he took, toge|ther
with half the number of the trading &s;hips: but,
falling in with the outward-bound fleet, convoyed by
thirteen &s;hips of the line, he was obliged to burn four of
the frigates, turn the fifth adrift, and part with all his
prizes except fifteen, which he carried into Dunkirk.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. The parliament of Scotland met on the
eighth day of September; and Lord Murray, &s;ecretary of
&s;tate, now Earl of Tullibardine, pre&s;ided as King's Com|mi&s;&s;ioner.
Though that kingdom was exhau&s;ted by the
war, and two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive bad harve&s;ts, which had driven a
great number of the inhabitants into Ireland, there was
no oppo&s;ition to the court-mea&s;ures. The members of
parliament &s;igned an a&s;&s;ociation like that of England.
They granted a &s;upply of one hundred and twenty thou|&s;and
pounds for maintaining their forces by &s;ea and land.
They pa&s;&s;ed an act for &s;ecuring their religion, lives, and
properties, in ca&s;e his Maje&s;ty &s;hould come to an untimely
death. By another, they obliged all per&s;ons in publick
tru&s;t to &s;ign the a&s;&s;ociation; and then the parliament was
adjourned to the eighth day of December. The di&s;turb|ances
of Ireland &s;eemed now to be entirely appea&s;ed. Lord
Capel dying in May, the council, by virtue of an act
pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of Henry VIII. elected the Chancellor,
Sir Charles Porter, to be Lord Ju&s;tice and chief governour
of that kingdom, until his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure &s;hould be
known. The parliament met in June: the Commons
expelled Mr. Sander&s;on, the only member of that Hou&s;e
who had refu&s;ed to &s;ign the a&s;&s;ociation; and adjourned
to the fourth day of Augu&s;t. By that time Sir Charles
Porter, and the Earls of Montrath and Drogheda, were
appointed Lords Ju&s;tices, and &s;ignified the King's plea|&s;ure
that they &s;hould adjourn. In the beginning of De|cember
the Chancellor died of an apoplexy.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. King William being tired of an inactive
campaign, left the army under the command of the
Elector of Bavaria, and, about the latter end of Augu&s;t
repaired to his palace at Loo, where he enjoyed his fa|vourite
<PB N="276" REF="280">
exerci&s;e of &s;tag-hunting. He vi&s;ited the court of
Brandenburgh at Cleves; conferred with the States of
Holland at the Hague; and, embarking for England,
landed at Margate on the &s;ixth day of October. The do|me&s;tick
oeconomy of the nation was extremely perplexed
at this juncture, from the &s;inking of publick credit, and
the &s;tagnation that nece&s;&s;arily attended a recoinage. The&s;e
grievances were with difficulty removed by the clear ap|prehen&s;ion,
the enterpri&s;ing genius, the un&s;haken forti|tude
of Mr. Montagu, Chancellor of the Exchequer,
operating upon a national &s;pirit of adventure, which the
monied-intere&s;t had produced. The King opened the
&s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament on the twentieth day of October,
with a &s;peech, importing, That overtures had been made
for a negociation; but that the be&s;t way of treating with
France would be &s;word in hand. He, therefore, de&s;ired
they would be expeditious in rai&s;ing the &s;upplies for the
&s;ervice of the en&s;uing year, as well as for making good
the funds already granted. He declared, that the civil
li&s;t could not be &s;upported without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He
recommended the mi&s;erable condition of the French pro|te&s;tants
to their compa&s;&s;ion. He de&s;ired they would con|trive
the be&s;t expedients for the recovery of the national
credit. He ob&s;erved, that unanimity and di&s;patch were
now more than ever nece&s;&s;ary for the honour, &s;afety, and
advantage of England. The Commons having taken this
&s;peech into con&s;ideration, re&s;olved, That they would
&s;upport his Maje&s;ty and his government, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in
the pro&s;ecution of the war: That the &s;tandard of gold and
&s;ilver &s;hould not be altered: and, That they would make
good all parliamentary funds. Then they pre&s;ented an
addre&s;s, in a very &s;pirited &s;train, declaring that, notwith|&s;tanding
the blood and trea&s;ure of which the nation had
been drained, the Commons of England would not be
diverted from their firm re&s;olutions of obtaining by war a
&s;afe and honourable peace. They, therefore, renewed
their a&s;&s;urances, that they would &s;upport his Maje&s;ty
again&s;t all his enemies at home and abroad. The Hou&s;e
<PB N="277" REF="281">
of Lords delivered another to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, declaring,
that they would never be wanting or backward, on their
parts, in what might be nece&s;&s;ary to his Maje&s;ty's honour,
the good of his kingdoms, and the quiet of Chri&s;tendom.
The Commons, in the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of their zeal, or|dered
two &s;editious pamphlets to be burned by the hands
of the common hangman. They deliberated upon the
e&s;timates, and granted above &s;ix millions for the &s;ervice of
the en&s;uing year. They re&s;olved, that a &s;upply &s;hould
be granted for making good the deficiency of parliamen|tary
funds; and appropriated &s;everal duties for this pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. With re&s;pect to the coin, they brought in
a bill, repealing an act for taking off the obligation and
encouragement of coining guineas for a certain time, and
for importing and coining guineas and half-guineas, as
the extravagant price of tho&s;e coins, which occa&s;ioned this
act, was now fallen. They pa&s;&s;ed a &s;econd bill for reme|dying
the ill &s;tate of the coin; and a third, explaining
an act in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion, for laying duties on low
wines and &s;pirits of the fir&s;t extraction. In order to rai&s;e
the &s;upplies of the year, they re&s;olved to tax all per&s;ons
according to the true value of their real and per&s;onal
e&s;tates, their &s;tock upon land and in trade, their income
by offices, pen&s;ions, and profe&s;&s;ions. A duty of one
penny per week, for one year, was laid upon all per&s;ons
not receiving alms. A further impo&s;ition of one farthing
in the pound per week was fixed upon all &s;ervants re|ceiving
four pounds per annum, as wages, and upwards,
to eight pounds a-year inclu&s;ive. Tho&s;e who received
from eight to &s;ixteen pounds were taxed at one-half-penny
per pound. An aid of three &s;hillings in the pound
for one year was laid upon all lands, tenements, and he|reditaments,
according to their true value. Without
&s;pecifying the particulars of tho&s;e impo&s;itions, we &s;hall
only ob&s;erve, that in the general charge, the Commons
did not exempt one member of the commonwealth that
could be &s;uppo&s;ed able to bear any part of the burthen.
<PB N="278" REF="282">
Provi&s;ion was made, that hammered money &s;hould be re|ceived
in payment of the&s;e duties, at the rate of five
&s;hillings and eight pence per ounce. All the deficiencies
on annuities and monies borrowed on the credit of the
Exchequer were transferred to this aid. The Trea&s;ury
was enabled to borrow a million and a half at eight per
cent. and to circulate Exchequer-bills to the amount of
as much more. To cancel the&s;e debts, the &s;urplus of all
the &s;upplies, except the three-&s;hilling-aid, was appro|priated.
The Commons voted one hundred and twenty-|five
thou&s;and pounds for making good the deficiency in
recoining the hammered money, and the recompence for
bringing in plate to the Mint. This &s;um was rai&s;ed by a
tax or duty upon wrought-plate, paper, pa&s;teboard, vellum,
and parchment, made or imported. Taking into con&s;i|deration
the &s;ervices, and the pre&s;ent langui&s;hing &s;tate of
the Bank, who&s;e notes were at twenty per cent. di&s;count,
they re&s;olved, That it &s;hould be enlarged by new &s;ub&s;crip|tions,
made by four-fifths in tallies &s;truck on parliament|ary
funds, and one-fifth in Bank-bills or notes: That
effectual provi&s;ion &s;hould be made by parliament, for
paying the principal of all &s;uch tallies as &s;hould be &s;ub|&s;cribed
into the Bank, out of the funds agreed to be con|tinued:
That an intere&s;t of eight per cent. &s;hould be
allowed on all &s;uch tallies: and, That the continuance of
the Bank &s;hould be prolonged to the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t,
in the year one thou&s;and, &s;even hundred, and ten: That
all a&s;&s;ignments of orders on tallies &s;ub&s;cribed into the Bank
&s;hould be regi&s;tered in the Exchequer: That, before the
day &s;hould be fixed for the beginning of the new &s;ub&s;crip|tions,
the old &s;hould be made one hundred per cent. and
what might exceed that value &s;hould be divided among the
old members: That all the intere&s;t due on tho&s;e tallies
which might be &s;ub&s;cribed into the Bank-&s;tock, at the
time appointed for-&s;ub&s;criptions, to the end of the la&s;t
preceding quarter on each tally, &s;hould be allowed as
principal: That liberty &s;hould be given by parliament to
enlarge the number of Bank-bills, to the value of the
<PB N="279" REF="283">
&s;um that &s;hould be &s;o &s;ub&s;cribed, over and above the
twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds; provided they &s;hould
be obliged to an&s;wer &s;uch bills and demands, and in de|fault
thereof, be an&s;wered by the Exchequer, out of the
fir&s;t money due to them: That no other bank &s;hould be
erected or allowed by act of parliament, during the con|tinuance
of the Bank of England: That this &s;hould be
exempted from all tax or impo&s;ition: That no act of the
corporation &s;hould forfeit the particular intere&s;t of any
per&s;on concerned therein: That provi&s;ion &s;hould be made
to prevent the officers of the Exchequer, and all other
officers and receivers of the revenue, from diverting, de|laying,
or ob&s;tructing the cour&s;e of payments to the Bank:
That care &s;hould be taken to prevent the altering, coun|terfeiting,
or forging any Bank-bills or notes: That the
e&s;tate and intere&s;t of each member in the &s;tock of the cor|poration
&s;hould be made a per&s;onal e&s;tate: That no con|tract
made for any Bank-&s;tock to be bought or &s;old &s;hould
be valued in law or equity, unle&s;s actually regi&s;tered in
the Bank-books within &s;even days, and actually trans|ferred
within fourteen days after the contract &s;hould be
made. A bill upon the&s;e re&s;olutions was brought in
under the direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer:
it related to the continuation of tonnage and poundage
upon wine, vinegar, and tobacco; and comprehended a
clau&s;e for laying an additional duty upon &s;alt, for two
years and three quarters. All the &s;everal branches con&s;ti|tuted
a general fund, &s;ince known by the name of the
General Mortgage, without prejudice to their former ap|propriations.
The bill al&s;o provided, That the tallies
&s;hould bear eight per cent. intere&s;t: That from the tenth
of June for five years they &s;hould bear no more than &s;ix
per cent. intere&s;t: and, That no premium or di&s;count
upon them &s;hould be taken. In ca&s;e of the general fund's
proving in&s;ufficient to pay the whole intere&s;t, it was pro|vided,
That every proprietor &s;hould receive his proportion
of the product, and the deficiency be made good from the
next aid: but, &s;hould the fund produce more than the
<PB N="280" REF="284">
intere&s;t, the &s;urplus was de&s;tined to operate as a &s;inking
fund for the di&s;charge of the principal. In order to make
up a deficiency of above eight hundred thou&s;and pounds,
occa&s;ioned by the failure of the land-bank, additional
duties were laid upon leather: the time was enlarged
for per&s;ons to come in and purcha&s;e the annuities payable
by &s;everal former acts, and to obtain more certain intere&s;t
in &s;uch annuities.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. Never were more vigorous mea&s;ures taken to
&s;upport the credit of the government; and never was the
government &s;erved by &s;uch a &s;et of enterpri&s;ing under|takers.
The Commons having received a me&s;&s;age from
the King, touching the condition of the civil li&s;t, re&s;olved,
That a &s;um not exceeding five hundred and fifteen thou|&s;and
pounds &s;hould be granted for the &s;upport of the civil
li&s;t for the en&s;uing year, to be rai&s;ed by a malt tax, and
additional duties upon mum, &s;weets, cyder, and perry.
They likewi&s;e re&s;olved, That an additional aid of one
&s;hilling in the pound &s;hould be laid upon land, as an
equivalent for the duty of ten per cent. upon mixed goods.
Provi&s;ion was made for rai&s;ing one million four hundred
thou&s;and pounds by a lottery. The Trea&s;ury was em|powered
to i&s;&s;ue an additional number of Exchequer-bills,
to the amount of twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds, every
hundred pounds bearing intere&s;t at the rate of five-pence a
day, and ten per cent. for circulation: finally, in order to
liquidate the tran&s;port-debt, which the funds e&s;tabli&s;hed
for that purpo&s;e had not been &s;ufficient to defray, a money-bill
was brought in, to oblige pedlars and hawkers to take
out licen&s;es, and pay for them at certain &s;tated prices.
One cannot without a&s;toni&s;hment reflect upon the pro|digious
efforts that were made upon this occa&s;ion, or con|&s;ider
without indignation the enormous fortunes that were
rai&s;ed up by u&s;urers and extortioners from the di&s;tre&s;&s;es
of their country. The nation did not &s;eem to know its
own &s;trength, until it was put to this extraordinary trial:
and the experiment of mortgaging funds &s;ucceeded &s;o well,
that later mini&s;ters have proceeded in the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem,
<PB N="281" REF="285">
impo&s;ing burthen upon burthen, as if they thought the
&s;inews of the nation could never be over&s;trained.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. The publick credit being thus bol&s;tered up by
the &s;ingular addre&s;s of Mr. Montagu, and the bills pa&s;&s;ed
for the &s;upplies of the en&s;uing year, the attention of the
Commons was transferred to the ca&s;e of Sir John Fenwick,
who had been apprehended in the month of June at New
Romney, in his way to France. He had, when taken,
written a letter to his lady by one Webber, who ac|companied
him; but this man being &s;ei&s;ed, the letter
was found, containing &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion as plainly evinced
him guilty. He then entered into a treaty with the court
for turning evidence, and delivered a long information in
writing, which was &s;ent abroad to his Maje&s;ty. He made
no di&s;coveries that could injure any of the Jacobites,
who, by his account, and other concurring te&s;timonies,
appeared to be divided into two parties, known by the
names of Compounders and Noncompounders. The fir&s;t,
headed by the Earl of Middleton, in&s;i&s;ted upon receiving
&s;ecurity from King James, that the religion and liberties
of England &s;hould be pre&s;erved: whereas, the other party,
at the head of which was the Earl of Melfort, re&s;olved to
bring him in without conditions, relying upon his own
honour and genero&s;ity. King William having &s;ent over
an order for bringing Fenwick to trial, unle&s;s he &s;hould
make more material di&s;coveries, the pri&s;oner, with a view
to amu&s;e the mini&s;try, until he could take other mea&s;ures
for his own &s;afety, accu&s;ed the Earls of Shrew&s;bury,
Marlborough, and Bath, the Lord Godolphin, and Ad|miral
Ru&s;&s;el, of having made their peace with King James,
and engaged to act for his intere&s;t. Mean while his lady
and relations tampered with the two witne&s;&s;es, Porter and
Goodman. The fir&s;t of the&s;e di&s;covered tho&s;e practices
to the government; and one Clancey, who acted as agent
for Lady Fenwick, was tried, convicted of &s;ubornation,
fined, and &s;et in the pillory: but they had &s;ucceeded
better in their attempts upon Goodman, who di&s;appeared:
&s;o that one witne&s;s only remained, and Fenwick began to
<PB N="282" REF="286">
think his life was out of danger. Admiral Ru&s;&s;el acquaint|ed
the Hou&s;e of Commons, that he and &s;everal per&s;ons of
quality had been reflected upon in &s;ome informations of
Sir John Fenwick: he, therefore, de&s;ired, that he might
have an opportunity to ju&s;tify his own character. Mr.
Secretary Trumball produced the papers, which having
been read, the Commons ordered, That Sir John Fen|wick
&s;hould be brought to the bar of the Hou&s;e. There he
was exhorted by the Speaker to make an ample di&s;covery;
which, however, he declined, except with the provi&s;o
that he &s;hould fir&s;t receive &s;ome &s;ecurity that what he might
&s;ay &s;hould not prejudice him&s;elf. He was ordered to
withdraw, until they &s;hould have deliberated on his reque&s;t.
Then he was called in again, and the keeper told him,
he might de&s;erve the favour of the Hou&s;e, by making a
full di&s;covery. He de&s;ired he might be indulged with a
little time to recollect him&s;elf, and promi&s;ed to obey the
command of the Hou&s;e. This favour being denied, he
again in&s;i&s;ted upon having &s;ecurity; which they refu&s;ing to
grant, he cho&s;e to be &s;ilent, and was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the
bar. The Hou&s;e voted, That his informations, reflecting
upon the fidelity of &s;everal noblemen, members of the
Hou&s;e, and others, upon hear&s;ay, were fal&s;e and &s;canda|lous,
contrived to undermine the government, and create
jealou&s;ies between the King and his &s;ubjects, in order to
&s;tifle the con&s;piracy.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. A motion being made, for leave to bring in a
bill to attaint him of high-trea&s;on, a warm debate en&s;ued,
and the que&s;tion being put, was carried in the affirmative
by a great majority. He was furni&s;hed with a copy of the
bill., and allowed the u&s;e of pen, ink, paper, and coun&s;el.
When he pre&s;ented a petition, praying that his coun&s;el might
be heard again&s;t pa&s;&s;ing the bill, they made an order, that his
coun&s;el &s;hould be allowed to make his defence at the bar
of the Hou&s;e: &s;o that he was &s;urpri&s;ed into an irregular
trial, in&s;tead of being indulged with an opportunity of
offering objections to their pa&s;&s;ing the bill of attainder.
He was accordingly brought to the bar of the Hou&s;e; and
<PB N="283" REF="287">
the bill being read in his hearing, the Speaker called upon
the King's coun&s;el to open the evidence. The pri&s;oner's
coun&s;el objected to their proceeding to trial, alledging,
that their client had not received the lea&s;t notice of their
purpo&s;e, and therefore could not be prepared for his de|fence;
but that they came to offer their rea&s;ons again&s;t
the bill. The Hou&s;e after a long debate, re&s;olved, That
he &s;hould be allowed further time to produce witne&s;&s;es in
his defence; that the coun&s;el for the King &s;hould likewi&s;e
be allowed to produce evidence to prove the trea&s;ons of
which he &s;tood indicted; and an order was made for his
being brought to the bar again in three days. In pur&s;u|ance
of this order he appeared, when the indictment which
had been found again&s;t him by the grand jury was pro|duced;
and Porter was examined as evidence. Then the
record of Clancey's conviction was read; and one Roe
te&s;tified, that Dighton, the pri&s;oner's &s;ollicitor, had
offered him an annuity of one hundred pounds, to di&s;credit
the te&s;timony of Goodman. The King's coun&s;el moved,
that Goodman's examination, as taken by Mr. Vernon,
clerk of the council, might be read. Sir J. Powis and
Sir Bartholomew Shower, the pri&s;oner's coun&s;el, warmly
oppo&s;ed this propo&s;al: they affirmed, that a depo&s;ition
taken when the party affected by it was not pre&s;ent to
cro&s;s-examine the depo&s;er could not be admitted in a ca&s;e
of five &s;hillings value: that though the Hou&s;e was not
bound by the rules of inferiour courts, it was neverthele&s;s
bound by the eternal and unalterable rules of ju&s;tice: that
no evidence, according to the rules of law, could be ad|mitted
in &s;uch a ca&s;e, but that of living witne&s;&s;es; and
that the examination of a per&s;on who is ab&s;ent was never
read to &s;upply his te&s;timony. The di&s;pute between the
lawyers on this &s;ubject gave ri&s;e to a very violent debate
among the members of the Hou&s;e. Sir Edward Seymour,
Sir Richard Temple, Mr. Harley, Mr. Harcourt, Mr.
Manly, Sir Chri&s;topher Mu&s;grave, and all the leaders of the
Tory-party, argued again&s;t the hard&s;hip and inju&s;tice of
admitting this information as an evidence. They demon|&s;trated,
<PB N="284" REF="288">
that it would be a &s;tep contrary to the practices o$
all courts of judicature, repugnant to the common notion
of ju&s;tice and humanity, diametrically oppo&s;ite to the la&s;$
act for regulating trials in ca&s;es of high trea&s;on, and o$
dangerous con&s;equences to the lives and liberties of th$
people. On the other hand, Lord Cutts, Sir Thoma$
Lyttelton, Mr. Montagu, Mr. Smith of the Trea&s;ury,
and Trevor, the Attorney-General, affirmed, that the
Hou&s;e was not bound by any form of law what&s;oever:
that this was an extraordinary ca&s;e, in which the &s;afety of
the government was deeply concerned: that though the
common law might require two evidences in ca&s;es of trea|&s;on,
the Hou&s;e had a power of deviating from tho&s;e rules
in extraordinary ca&s;es: that there was no rea&s;on to doubt
of Sir John Fenwick's being concerned in the con&s;piracy:
that he or his friends had tampered with Porter; and that
there were &s;trong pre&s;umptions to believe the &s;ame practices
had induced Goodman to ab&s;cond. In a word, the Tories,
either from party or patrioti&s;m, &s;trenuou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted the
cau&s;e of liberty and humanity, by tho&s;e very arguments
which had been u&s;ed again&s;t them in the former reigns;
while the Whigs, with equal violence and more &s;ucce&s;s,
e&s;pou&s;ed the dictates of arbitrary power and oppre&s;&s;ion, in
the face of their former principles, with which they were
now upbraided. At length, the que&s;tion was put, Whe|ther
or not the information of Goodman &s;hould be read?
and was carried in the affirmative by a majority of &s;eventy-three
voices. Then two of the grand-jury who had found
the indictment, recited the evidence which had been given
to them by Porter and Goodman: la&s;tly, the King's
coun&s;el in&s;i&s;ted upon producing the record of Cooke's
conviction, as he had been tried for the &s;ame con&s;piracy.
The pri&s;oner's coun&s;el objected, That if &s;uch evidence
was admitted, the trial of one per&s;on in the &s;ame company
would be the trial of all; and it could not be expected
that they who came to defend Sir John Fenwick only,
&s;hould be prepared to an&s;wer the charge again&s;t Cooke.
This article produced another vehement debate among the
<PB N="285" REF="289">
members; and the Whigs obtained a &s;econd victory.
The record was read, and the King's coun&s;el proceeded
to call on &s;ome of the jury who &s;erved on Cooke's trial,
to affirm that he had been convicted on Goodman's evi|dence.
Sir Bartholomew Shower &s;aid, he would &s;ubmit it
to the con&s;ideration of the Hou&s;e, Whether it was ju&s;t
that the evidence again&s;t one per&s;on &s;hould conclude again&s;t
another &s;tanding at a different bar, in defence of his life?
The parties were again ordered to withdraw; and from
this point aro&s;e a third debate, which ended as the two
former, to the di&s;advantage of the pri&s;oner. The jury
being examined, Mr. Serjeant Gould moved, that
Mr. Vernon might be de&s;ired to produce the intercepted
letter from Sir John Fenwick to his lady. The pri&s;o|ner's
coun&s;el warmly oppo&s;ed this motion, in&s;i&s;ting upon
their proving it to be his hand-writing before it could be
u&s;ed again&s;t him; and no further &s;tre&s;s was laid on this
evidence. When they were called upon to enter on his
defence, they pleaded incapacity to deliver matters of
&s;uch importance after they had been fatigued with twelve
hours attendance.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. The Hou&s;e re&s;olved to hear &s;uch evidence as
the pri&s;oner had to produce that night. His coun&s;el de|clared,
that they had nothing then to produce but the copy
of a record; and the &s;econd re&s;olution was, that he &s;hould
be brought up again next day at noon. He accordingly
appeared at the bar, and Sir J. Powis proceeded on his
defence. He ob&s;erved, that the bill under con&s;ideration
affected the lives of the &s;ubjects; and &s;uch precedents
were dangerous: that Sir John Fenwick was forthcoming,
in order to be tried by the ordinary methods of ju&s;tice:
that he was actually under proce&s;s, had pleaded, and
was ready to &s;tand trial: that if there was &s;ufficient clear
evidence again&s;t him, as the King's Serjeant had declared,
there was no rea&s;on for his being deprived of the benefit
of &s;uch a trial as was the birth-right of every Briti&s;h &s;ub|ject;
and if there was a deficiency of legal evidence, he
thought this was a very odd rea&s;on for the bill. He took

notice that even the regicides had the benefit of &s;uch a trial:
that the la&s;t act for regulating trials in ca&s;es of trea&s;on
proved the great tenderne&s;s of the laws which affected
the life of the &s;ubject: and he expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e that
the very parliament which had pa&s;&s;ed that law, &s;hould
enact another for putting a per&s;on to death without any
trial at all. He admitted that there had been many bills
of attainder, but they were generally levelled at outlaws
and fugitives; and &s;ome of them had been rever&s;ed in the
&s;equel, as arbitrary and unju&s;t. He urged, that this bill
of attainder did not alledge or &s;ay, that Sir John Fenwick
was guilty of the trea&s;on for which he had been indicted;
a circum&s;tance which prevented him from producing wit|ne&s;&s;es
to that and &s;everal matters upon which the King's
coun&s;el had expatiated. He &s;aid, they had introduced evi|dence
to prove circum&s;tances not alledged in the bill and
defective evidence of tho&s;e that were; that Porter was
not examined upon oath: that nothing could be more
&s;evere than to pa&s;s &s;entence of death upon a man, corrupt
his blood, and confi&s;cate his e&s;tate, upon parole evidence;
e&s;pecially of &s;uch a wretch, who, by his own confe&s;&s;ion,
had been engaged in a crime of the blacke&s;t nature, not
a convert to the dictates of con&s;cience, but a coward,
&s;hrinking from the danger by which he had been envi|roned,
and even now drudging for a pardon. He invali|dated
the evidence of Goodman's examination. He ob|&s;erved,
that the indictment mentioned a con&s;piracy to call
in a foreign power; but, as this con&s;piracy had not been
put in practice, &s;uch an agreement was not a &s;ufficient
overt-act of trea&s;on, according to the opinion of Hawles,
the Sollicitor-General, concerned in this very pro&s;ecution.
So &s;aying, he produced a book of remarks, which that
lawyer had publi&s;hed on the ca&s;es of Lord Ru&s;&s;el, Colonel
Sidney, and others who had &s;uffered death in the reign
of Charles II. This author, (&s;aid he) takes notice, that a
con&s;piracy or agreement to levy war, is not trea&s;on without
actually levying war; a &s;entiment in which he concurred
with Lord Coke, and Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Hales. He con|cluded
<PB N="287" REF="291">
with &s;aying, &startq;We know at pre&s;ent on what ground
we &s;tand; by the &s;tatute of Edward III. we know what
trea&s;on is; by the two &s;tatutes of Edward VI. and the
late act, we know what is proof; by the magna charta
we know we are to be tried <HI>per legem terrae &amp; per judi|cium
parium,</HI> by the law of the land and the judgment
of our peers: but, if bills of attainder come into fa&s;hion,
we &s;hall neither know what is trea&s;on, what is evidence,
nor how, nor where we are to be tried.&endq;&mdash;He was
&s;econded by Sir Bartholomew Shower, who &s;poke with
equal energy and elocution; and their arguments were
an&s;wered by the King's coun&s;el. The arguments in favour
of the bill, imported, that the parliament would not in|terpo&s;e,
except in extraordinary ca&s;es; that here the
evidence nece&s;&s;ary in inferior courts being defective, the
parliament, which was not tied down by legal evidence,
had a right to exert their extraordinary power in puni&s;h|ing
an offender, who would otherwi&s;e e&s;cape with impu|nity:
that as the law &s;tood, he was but a &s;orry politician that
could not ruin the government, and yet elude the &s;tatute
of trea&s;on: that if a plot, after being di&s;covered, &s;hould
not be thoroughly pro&s;ecuted, it would &s;trengthen and
grow upon the admini&s;tration, and probably at length &s;ub|vert
the government: that it was notorious that parties
were forming for King James; per&s;ons were plotting in
every part of the kingdom, and an open inva&s;ion was
threatened; therefore, this was a proper time for the
parliament to exert their extraordinary power: that the
Engli&s;h differed from all other nations, in bringing the
witne&s;&s;es and the pri&s;oner face to face, and requiring two
witne&s;&s;es in ca&s;es of trea&s;on: nor did the Engli&s;h law it&s;elf
require the &s;ame proof in &s;ome ca&s;es, as in others; for
one witne&s;s was &s;ufficient in felony, as well as for the
trea&s;on of coining; that Fenwick was notoriou&s;ly guilty,
and de&s;erved to feel the re&s;entment of the nation: that
he would have been brought to exemplary puni&s;hment
in the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, had he not eluded it, by
corrupting evidence, and withdrawing a witne&s;s. If this
<PB N="288" REF="292">
rea&s;oning be ju&s;t, the Hou&s;e of Commons has a right to
act in diametrical oppo&s;ition to the laws in being; and is
ve&s;ted with a de&s;potick power over the lives and fortunes
of their con&s;tituents, for who&s;e protection they are con|&s;tituted.
Let us, therefore, reflect upon the po&s;&s;ibility of a
parliament debauched by the arts of corruption, into &s;er|vile
compliance with the de&s;igns of an arbitrary prince,
and tremble for the con&s;equence. The debate being fini&s;hed,
the pri&s;oner was, at the de&s;ire of Admiral Ru&s;&s;el, que&s;|tioned
with regard to the imputations he had fixed upon
that gentleman and others, from hear&s;ay: but he de&s;ired
to be excu&s;ed on account of the ri&s;que he ran while un|der
a double pro&s;ecution, if any thing which &s;hould e&s;|cape
him might be turned to his prejudice.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. After he was removed from the bar, Mr.
Vernon, at the de&s;ire of the Hou&s;e, re-capitulated the arts
and practices of Sir John Fenwick and his friends, to
procra&s;tinate the trial. The bill was read a &s;econd time;
and the Speaker a&s;king, If the que&s;tion &s;hould be put for
its being committed? the Hou&s;e was immediately kindled
into a new flame of contention. Hawles, the Sollicitor-General,
affirmed, that the Hou&s;e in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e,
&s;hould act both as judge and jury. Mr. Harcourt, &s;aid,
he knew of no trial for trea&s;on but what was confirmed
by magna charta, by a jury, the birthright and darling
privilege of an Engli&s;hman, or <HI>per legem terrae,</HI> which
includes impeachments in parliament: that it was a &s;trange
trial where the per&s;on accu&s;ed had a chance to be hanged,
but none to be &s;aved: that he never heard of a juryman
who was not on his oath, nor of a judge who had not
power to examine witne&s;&s;es upon oath, and who was not
empowered to &s;ave the innocent as well as to condemn
the guilty. Sir Thomas Lyttelton was of opinion, that the
parliament ought not to &s;tand upon little niceties and
forms of other courts, when the government was at &s;take.
Mr. Howe a&s;&s;erted, that to do a thing of this nature,
becau&s;e the parliament had power to do it, was a
&s;trange way of rea&s;oning: that what was ju&s;tice and
<PB N="298" REF="293">
equity at We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, was ju&s;tice and equity every
where: that one bad precedent in parliament was of
wor&s;e con&s;equence than an hundred in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall,
becau&s;e per&s;onal or private injuries did not foreclo&s;e the
claims of original right; whereas, the parliament could
ruin the nation beyond redemption, becau&s;e it could
e&s;tabli&s;h tyranny by law. Sir Richard Temple, in argu|ing
again&s;t the bill, ob&s;erved, that the power of parliament
is to make any law, but the juri&s;diction of parliament is to
govern it&s;elf by the law: to make a law, therefore, again&s;t
all the laws of England, was the <HI>ultimum remedium &amp;
pe&s;&s;imum,</HI> never to be u&s;ed but in ca&s;e of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity.
He affirmed that by this precedent the Hou&s;e overthrew all
the laws of England; fir&s;t, in condemning a man upon
one witne&s;s; &s;econdly, in pa&s;&s;ing an act without any trial.
The Commons never did nor can a&s;&s;ume a juri&s;diction of
trying any per&s;on: they may for their own information,
hear what can be offered; but, it is not a trial where wit|ne&s;&s;es
are not upon oath. All bills of attainder have
pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t per&s;ons that were dead or fled, or without
the compa&s;s of the law: &s;ome have been brought in after
trials in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall; but none of tho&s;e have been
called trials, and they were generally rever&s;ed. He denied
that the parliament had power to declare any thing trea&s;on
which was not trea&s;on before. When inferior courts
were dubious, the ca&s;e might be brought before the par|liament,
to judge whether it was trea&s;on or felony: but,
then they mu&s;t judge by the laws in being; and this judge|ment
was not in the parliament by bill, but only in the
Hou&s;e of Lords. Lord Digby, Mr. Harley, and Colonel
Granville, &s;poke to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. But their argu|ments
and remon&s;trances had no effect upon the majority,
by whom the pri&s;oner was devoted to de&s;truction. The
bill was committed, pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;ent up to the Hou&s;e
of Lords, where it produced the longe&s;t and warme&s;t de|bates
which had been known &s;ince the Re&s;toration. Bi&s;hop
Burnet &s;ignali&s;ed his zeal for the government, by a long
&s;peech in favour of the bill, contradicting &s;ome of the
<PB N="290" REF="294">
fundamental maxims which he had formerly avowed in
behalf of the liberties of the people. At length it was
carried by a majority of &s;even voices; and one and forty
lords, including eight prelates, entered a prote&s;t, couched
in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, again&s;t the deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect; XLV. When the bill received the royal a&s;&s;ent,
another act of the like nature pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t Barclay,
Holmes, and nine other con&s;pirators who had fled from
ju&s;tice, in ca&s;e they &s;hould not &s;urrender them&s;elves on or
before the twenty-fifth day of March next en&s;uing. Sir
John Fenwick &s;olicited the mediation of the Lords in his
behalf, while his friends implored the royal mercy. The
Peers gave him to under&s;tand, that the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;uit
would depend upon the fullne&s;s of his di&s;coveries. He
would have previou&s;ly &s;tipulated for a pardon; and they
in&s;i&s;ted upon his depending on their favour. He he&s;itated
&s;ome time between the fears of infamy and the terrours of
death, which la&s;t he at length cho&s;e to undergo, rather
than incur the di&s;graceful character of an informer. He
was complimented with the ax, in con&s;ideration of his rank
and alliance with the hou&s;e of Howard, and &s;uffered on
Tower-hill with great compo&s;ure. In the paper which
he delivered to the Sheriff, he took God to witne&s;s, that
he knew not of the intended inva&s;ion, until it was the
common &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e; nor was he engaged in any
&s;hape for the &s;ervice of King James. He thanked tho&s;e
noble and worthy per&s;ons who had oppo&s;ed his attainder
in parliament; prote&s;ted before God, that the information
he gave to the mini&s;try he had received in letters and
me&s;&s;ages from France; and ob&s;erved, that he might have
expected mercy from the Prince of Orange, as he had
been in&s;trumental in &s;aving his life, by preventing the
execution of a de&s;ign which had been formed again&s;t it;
a circum&s;tance which in all probability induced the late
con&s;pirators to conceal their purpo&s;e of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination from
his knowledge. He profe&s;&s;ed his loyalty to King James,
and prayed Heaven for his &s;peedy re&s;toration.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="295">
&sect; XLVI. While Fenwick's affair was in agitation,
the Earl of Monmouth had &s;et on foot &s;ome practices
again&s;t the Duke of Shrew&s;bury. One Matthew Smith,
nephew to Sir William Perkins, had been entertained as
a &s;py by this nobleman, who finding his intelligence of
very little u&s;e or importance, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him as a trouble|&s;ome
dependent. Then he had recour&s;e to the Earl of
Monmouth, into whom he infu&s;ed unfavourable &s;enti|ments
of the Duke; in&s;inuating, that he had made great
di&s;coveries, which, from &s;ini&s;ter motives, were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.
Monmouth communicated tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions to the Earl of
Portland, who inli&s;ted Smith as one of his intelligencers.
Copies of the letters he had &s;ent to the Duke of Shrew&s;|bury
were delivered to Secretary Trumball, &s;ealed up for
the peru&s;al of his Maje&s;ty at his return from Flanders.
When Fenwick mentioned the Duke of Shrew&s;bury in his
di&s;coveries, the Earl of Monmouth re&s;olved to &s;ei&s;e the
opportunity of ruining that nobleman. He, by the canal
of the Duche&s;s of Norfolk, exhorted Lady Fenwick to pre|vail
upon her hu&s;band to per&s;i&s;t in his accu&s;ation, and even
dictated a paper of directions. Fenwick rejected the propo&s;al
with di&s;dain, as a &s;candalous contrivance; and Monmouth
was &s;o incen&s;ed at his refu&s;al, that when the bill of attainder
appeared in the Hou&s;e of Lords, he &s;poke in favour of it with
peculiar vehemence. Lady Fenwick, provoked at this cruel
outrage, prevailed upon her nephew, the Earl of Carli&s;le,
to move the Hou&s;e that Sir John might be examined
touching any advices that had been &s;ent to him with re|lation
to his di&s;coveries. Fenwick being interrogated ac|cordingly,
gave an account of all the particulars of Mon|mouth's
&s;cheme, which was calculated to ruin the Duke
of Shrew&s;bury, by bringing Smith's letters on the carpet.
The Duche&s;s of Norfolk and a confidant were examined,
and confirmed the detection. The Hou&s;e called for Smith's
letters, which were produced by Sir William Trumball.
The Earl of Monmouth was committed to the Tower,
and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from all his employments. He was relea&s;ed,
however, at the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion; and the court made up
<PB N="292" REF="296">
all his lo&s;&s;es in private, le&s;t he &s;hould be tempted to join
the oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVII. The Whigs, before they were glutted with
the &s;acrifice of Fenwick, had determined to let loo&s;e their
vengeance upon Sir George Rooke, who was a leader in
the oppo&s;ite intere&s;t. Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel had been
&s;ent with a &s;quadron to look into Bre&s;t, where, according
to the intelligence which the government had received, the
French were employed in preparing for a de&s;cent upon
England; but this information was fal&s;e. They were
bu&s;y in equipping an armament for the We&s;t-Indies, under
the command of M. Pointis, who actually &s;ailed to the
coa&s;t of New-Spain, and took the city of Carthagena.
Rooke had been ordered to intercept the Toulon &s;quadron
in its way to Bre&s;t; but his endeavours mi&s;carried. The
Commons, in a committee of the whole Hou&s;e, re&s;olved to
enquire why this fleet was not intercepted? Rooke under|went
a long examination, and was obliged to produce his
journal, orders, and letters. Shovel and Mitchel were
likewi&s;e examined; but, nothing appearing to the pre|judice
of the Admiral, the Hou&s;e thought proper to de&s;i&s;t
from their pro&s;ecution. After they had determined on the
fate of Fenwick, they proceeded to enact &s;everal laws
for regulating the dome&s;tick oeconomy of the nation:
among others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bu$net. Kenn$t. Oldmixon. State Trials. Tindal. Ra$ph. Liv$s of the Admirals.</NOTE> they pa&s;&s;ed an act for the more effectual
relief of creditors, in ca&s;es of e&s;cape, and for preventing
abu&s;es in pri&s;ons and pretended privileged places. Ever
&s;ince the reformation, certain places in and about the city
of London, which had been &s;anctuaries during the pre|valence
of the popi&s;h religion, afforded a&s;ylum to debtors,
and were become receptacles of de&s;perate per&s;ons, who
pre&s;umed to &s;et the law at defiance. One of th$&s;e places,
called White-Friars, was filled with a crew of ru&s;&s;ians,
who every day committed acts of violence and outrage:
but this law was &s;o vigorou&s;ly put in execution, that
they were obliged to abandon the di&s;trict, which was &s;oon
filled with more creditable inhabitants. On the &s;ix|teenth
day of April, the King clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion with a
<PB N="293" REF="297">
&s;hort &s;peech, thanking the parliament for the great &s;up|plies
they had &s;o chearfully granted, and expre&s;&s;ing his
&s;atisfaction at the mea&s;ures they had taken for retrieving
the publick credit. Before he quitted the kingdom, he
ventured to produce upon the &s;cene the Earl of Sunder|land,
who had hitherto prompted his councils behind the
curtain. That politician was now &s;worn of the privy-council,
and gratified with the office of Lord-Chamber|lain,
which had been re&s;igned by the Earl of Dor&s;et, a
nobleman of elegant talents, and invincible indolence;
&s;evere and poignant in his writings and remarks upon
mankind in general, but humane, good-natured, and
generous to exce&s;s, in his commerce with individuals.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVIII. William having made &s;ome promotions<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Somers was created a baron, and appointed Lord-Chancellor of England: Admiral Ru&s;&s;el was dignified with the title of Earl of Orfo$d. In February the Earl of Ayle&s;bury, who had been committed on account of the con&s;pi|racy, was relea&s;ed upon bail; but, this privilege was denied to Lord Mon$|gomery, who had been impri&s;oned in Newgate on the &s;ame account.</NOTE>,
and appointed a regency, embarked on the twenty-&s;ixth
day of April for Holland, that he might be at hand to
manage the negociation for a general peace. By this time
the preliminaries were &s;ettled, between Callieres the
French mini&s;ter, and Mr. Dykveldt in behalf of the
States-General, who re&s;olved, in con&s;equence of the con|ce&s;&s;ions
made by France, that, in concert with their al|lies,
the mediation of Sweden might be accepted. The
Emperor and the court of Spain, however, were not &s;atis|fied
with tho&s;e conce&s;&s;ions: yet, his Imperial Maje&s;ty
declared he would embrace the proffered mediation, pro|vided
the treaty of We&s;tphalia &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed;
and provided the King of Sweden would engage to join his
troops with tho&s;e of the allies, in ca&s;e France &s;hould
break through this &s;tipulation. This propo&s;al being deli|vered,
the mini&s;ters of England and Holland at Vienna,
pre&s;ented a joint memorial, pre&s;&s;ing his Imperial Maje&s;ty
to accept the mediation without re&s;erve, and name a place
at which the congre&s;s might be opened. The Emperor
<PB N="294" REF="298">
complied with reluctance. On the fourteenth day of Fe|bruary,
all the mini&s;ters of the allies, except the amba&s;|&s;ador
of Spain, agreed to the propo&s;al; and next day &s;ig|nified
their a&s;&s;ent in form to M. Lillienroot, the Swedi&s;h
plenipotentiary. Spain demanded, as a preliminary,
that France would agree to re&s;tore all the places
mentioned in a long li&s;t, which the mini&s;ter of that
crown pre&s;ented to the a&s;&s;embly. The Emperor propo&s;ed,
that the congre&s;s &s;hould be held at Aix-la-Chapelle, or
Franckfort, or &s;ome other town in Germany. The other
allies were more di&s;po&s;ed to negociate in Holland. At
length the French King &s;ugge&s;ted, that no place would be
more proper than a palace belonging to King William,
called Newbourg-hou&s;e, &s;ituated between the Hague and
Delft, clo&s;e by the village of Ry&s;vick; and to this propo|&s;ition
the mini&s;ters agreed. Tho&s;e of England were the
Earl of Pembroke, a virtuous, learned, and popular no|bleman,
the Lord Villiers, and Sir Jo&s;eph William&s;on:
France &s;ent Harlay and Crecy to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Cal|lieres.
Louis was not only tired of the war, on account
of the mi&s;ery in which it had involved his kingdom; but
in de&s;iring a peace he was actuated by another motive.
The King of Spain had been for &s;ome time in a very
ill &s;tate of health, and the French monarch had an
eye to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. This aim could not be accom|pli&s;hed
while the confederacy &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; therefore, he
eagerly &s;ought a peace, that he might at once turn his
whole power again&s;t Spain, as &s;oon as Charles &s;hould
expire. The Emperor harboured the &s;ame de&s;ign upon
the Spani&s;h crown, and for that rea&s;on intere&s;ted him|&s;elf
in the continuance of the grand alliance. Be|&s;ides,
he fore&s;aw he &s;hould in a little time be able to
act again&s;t France with an augmented force. The Czar
of Mu&s;covy had engaged to find employment for the
Turks and Tartars. He intended to rai&s;e the Elector of
Saxony to the throne of Poland; and he had made &s;ome
p$ogre&s;s in a negociation with the Circles of the Rhine,
for a con&s;iderable body of auxiliary troops. The Dutch
<PB N="295" REF="299">
had no other view but that of &s;ecuring a barrier in the
Netherlands. King William in&s;i&s;ted upon the French
King's acknowledging his title; and the Engli&s;h nation
wi&s;hed for nothing &s;o much as the end of a ruinous war.
On the tenth day of February, Callieres, in the name of
his ma&s;ter, agreed to the following preliminaries: That
the treaties of We&s;tphalia and Nimeguen &s;hould be the
ba&s;is of this negociation: that Stra&s;bourg &s;hould be re|&s;tored
to the Empire, and Luxembourg to the Spaniards,
together with Mons, Charleroy, and all places taken by
the French in Catalonia &s;ince the treaty of Nimeguen:
that Dinant &s;hould be ceded to the Bi&s;hop of Liege, and
all re-unions &s;ince the treaty of Nimeguen be made void:
that the French King &s;hould make re&s;titution of Lor|raine;
and, upon conclu&s;ion of the peace, acknowledge
the Prince of Orange as King of Great-Britain, without
condition and re&s;erve. The conferences were interrupted
by the death of Charles XI. King of Sweden, who was
&s;ucceeded by his &s;on Charles, then a minor: but the
Queen and five &s;enators, whom the late King had by will
appointed admini&s;trators of the government, re&s;olved to
pur&s;ue the meditation, and &s;ent a new commi&s;&s;ion to Lil|lienroot
for that purpo&s;e. The ceremonials being regu|lated
with the con&s;ent of all parties, the plenipotentiaries
of the Emperor delivered their ma&s;ter's demands to the
mediatour, on the twenty-&s;econd day of May, and &s;eve|ral
German mini&s;ters gave in the preten&s;ions of the re|&s;pective
princes whom they repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIX. Mean while, the French King, in the hope
of procuring more favourable terms, re&s;olved to make his
la&s;t effort again&s;t the Spaniards in Catalonia and in the
Netherlands, and to elevate the Prince of Conti to the
throne of Poland; an event which would have greatly
improved the intere&s;t of France in Europe. Louis had
got the &s;tart of the confederates in Flanders, and &s;ent
thither a very numerous army, commanded by Catinat,
Villeroy, and Boufflers. The campaign was opened with
the &s;iege of Aeth, which was no &s;ooner inve&s;ted, than
<PB N="296" REF="300">
King William, having recovered of an indi&s;po&s;ition,
took the field, and had an interview with the Duke of
Bavaria, who commanded a &s;eparate body. He did not
think proper to interrupt the enemy in their operations
before Aeth, which &s;urrendered in a few days after the
trenches were opened; but contented him&s;elf with taking
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an advantageous camp, where he covered
Bru&s;&s;els, which Villeroy and Boufflers had determined to
be&s;iege. In Catalonia the Duke of Vendome inve&s;ted
Barcelona, in which there was a garri&s;on of ten thou&s;and
regular &s;oldiers, be&s;ides five thou&s;and burghers, who had
voluntarily taken arms on this occa&s;ion. The governor
of the place was the Prince of He&s;&s;e d'Arm&s;tadt, who had
&s;erved in Ireland, and been ve&s;ted with the command of
the Imperial troops which were &s;ent into Spain. The
French general being re-enforced from Provence and
Languedoc, carried on his approaches with &s;urpri&s;ing
impetuo&s;ity; and was repul&s;ed in &s;everal attacks by the
valour of the defendants. At length, the enemy &s;ur|pri&s;ed
and routed the viceroy of Catalonia; and, flu&s;hed
with this victory, &s;tormed the outworks, which had been
long battered with their cannon. The di&s;pute was very
bloody and ob&s;tinate; but the French, by dint of numbers,
made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the covered-way and two
ba&s;tions. There they erected batteries of cannon and
mortars, and fired furiou&s;ly on the town, which, however,
the Prince of He&s;&s;e re&s;olved to defend to the la&s;t extre|mity.
The court of Madrid, however, unwilling to &s;ee
the place entirely ruined, as in all probability it would be
re&s;tored at the peace, di&s;patched an order to the prince to
capitulate; and he obtained very honourable terms, after
having made a glorious defence for nine weeks; in con&s;i|deration
of which he was appointed viceroy of the pro|vince.
France was no &s;ooner in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this im|portant
place, than the Spaniards became as eager for
peace as they had been before aver&s;e to a negociation.</P>
<P>&sect; L. Their impatience was not a little inflamed by the
&s;ucce&s;s of Pointis in America, where he took Carthagena,
<PB N="297" REF="301">
in which he found a booty amounting to eight millions of
crowns. Having ruined the fortifications of the place,
and received advice, that an Engli&s;h &s;quadron under
Admiral Nevil had arrived in the We&s;t-Indies, with a
de&s;ign to attack him in his return, he bore away for the
&s;traits of Bahama. On the twenty-&s;econd day of May he
fell in with the Engli&s;h fleet, and one of his fly-boats was
taken; but, &s;uch was his dexterity, or good fortune,
that he e&s;caped, after having been pur&s;ued five days, dur|ing
which the Engli&s;h and Dutch rear-admirals &s;prang
their fore-topma&s;ts, and received other damage, &s;o as that
they could not proceed. Then Nevil &s;teered to Carthagena,
which he found quite abandoned by the inhabitants, who,
after the departure of Pointis, had been rifled a &s;econd
time by the buccaneers, on pretence that they had been
defrauded of their &s;hare of the plunder. This was really
the ca&s;e: they had in a great mea&s;ure contributed to the
&s;ucce&s;s of Pointis, and were very ill rewarded. In a few
days the Engli&s;h admiral di&s;covered eight &s;ail of their
&s;hips, two of which were forced on &s;hore and de&s;troyed,
two taken, and the re&s;t e&s;caped. Then he directed his
cour&s;e to Jamaica, and, by the advice of the governor,
Sir William Bee&s;ton, detached Rear-Admiral Meeze with
&s;ome &s;hips and forces to attack Petit-Guavas, which he
accordingly &s;urpri&s;ed, burned, and reduced to a&s;hes.
After this &s;mall expedition Nevil proceeded to the Ha|vannah,
on purpo&s;e to take the galleons under his convoy
for Europe, according to the in&s;tructions he had received
from the King: but the governor of the place, and the
general of the plate-fleet, &s;u&s;pecting &s;uch an offer, would
neither &s;uffer him to enter the harbour, nor put the
galleons under his protection. He now &s;ailed through the
gulf of Florida to Virginia, where he died of chagrin, and
the command of the fleet devolved on Captain Dilkes, who
arrived in England on the twenty-fourth day of October,
with a &s;hattered &s;quadron, half-manned, to the un&s;peak|able
mortification of the people, who &s;lattered them&s;elves
with the hopes of wealth and glory from this expedition.
<PB N="298" REF="302">
Pointis &s;teering to the banks of Newfoundland, entered
the bay of Conceptione, at a time when a &s;tout Engli&s;h
&s;quadron commanded by Commodore Norris lay at anchor
in the bay of St. John's. This officer being informed of
the arrival of a French fleet, at fir&s;t concluded, that it
was the &s;quadron of M. Ne&s;mond come to attack him,
and exerted his utmo&s;t endeavours to put the place in a
po&s;ture of defence: but afterwards, under&s;tanding that it
was Pointis returning with the &s;poil of Carthagena, he
called a council of war, and propo&s;ed to go immediately
in que&s;t of the enemy. He was, however, over-ruled by
a majority, who gave it as their opinion, that they
&s;hould remain where they were, without running unne|ce&s;&s;ary
hazards. By virtue of this &s;candalous determina|tion,
Pointis was permitted to proceed on his voyage to
Europe; but he had not yet e&s;caped every danger. On
the fourteenth day of Augu&s;t he fell in with a &s;quadron
under the command of Captain Harlow, by whom he was
boldly engaged till night parted the combatants. He was
pur&s;ued next day; but his &s;hips &s;ailing better than tho&s;e of
Harlow, he accompli&s;hed his e&s;cape, and on the morrow
entered the harbour of Bre&s;t. That his &s;hips, which were
foul, &s;hould out-&s;ail the Engli&s;h &s;quadron, which had ju&s;t
put to &s;ea, was a my&s;tery which the people of England
could not explain. They complained of having been be|trayed
through the whole cour&s;e of the We&s;t-Indian expe|dition.
The King owned he did not under&s;tand marine
affairs, the entire conduct of which he abandoned to
Ru&s;&s;el, who became proud, arbitrary, and unpopular, and
was &s;uppo&s;ed to be betrayed by his dependents. Certain it
is, the &s;ervice was greatly ob&s;tructed by faction among the
officers, which with re&s;pect to the nation had all the ef|fects
of treachery and mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P>&sect; LI. The &s;ucce&s;s of the French in Catalonia, Flanders,
and the We&s;t-Indies, was balanced by their di&s;appoint|ment
in Poland. Louis, encouraged by the remon&s;trances
of the Abb&eacute; de Polignac, who managed the affairs of
France in that kingdom, re&s;olved to &s;upport the Prince of
<PB N="299" REF="303">
Conti as a candidate for the crown, and remitted great
&s;ums of money, which were di&s;tributed among the Poli&s;h
nobility. The Emperor had at fir&s;t declared for the &s;on
of the late King: but, finding the French party too &s;trong
for this competitor, he entered into a negociation with the
Elector of Saxony, who agreed to change his religion, to
di&s;tribute eight millions of florins among the Poles, to
confirm their privileges, and advance with his troops to
the frontiers of that kingdom. Having performed the&s;e
articles, he declared him&s;elf a candidate, and was pub|lickly
e&s;pou&s;ed by the Imperiali&s;ts. The Duke of Lor|raine,
the Prince of Baden, and Don Livio Ode&s;chalchi,
nephew to Pope Innocent, were likewi&s;e competitors; but
finding their intere&s;t in&s;ufficient, they united their influence
with that of the Elector, who was proclaimed King of
Poland. He forthwith took the oaths required, procured
an atte&s;tation from the Imperial court of his having
changed his religion, and marched with his army to
Cracow, where he was crowned with the u&s;ual &s;olemnity.
Louis per&s;i&s;ted in maintaining the preten&s;ions of the
Prince of Conti, and equipped a fleet at Dunkirk for his
convoy to Dantzick in his way to Poland. But the ma|gi&s;trates
of that city, who had declared for the new king,
would not &s;uffer his men to land, though they offered to
admit him&s;elf with a &s;mall retinue. He, therefore, went
on &s;hore at Marienburgh, where he was met by &s;ome
chiefs of his own party; but the new King Augu&s;tus
acted with &s;uch vigilance, that he found it impracticable
to form an army: be&s;ides, he &s;u&s;pected the &s;idelity of his
own Poli&s;h parti&s;ans: he, therefore, refu&s;ed to part with the
trea&s;ure he had brought, and in the beginning of winter
returned to Dunkirk.</P>
<P>&sect; LII. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of Augu&s;tus on the throne of
Poland was in &s;ome mea&s;ure owing to the conduct of
Peter the Czar of Mu&s;covy, who having formed great
de&s;igns again&s;t the Ottoman-Porte, was very unwilling to
&s;ee the crown of Poland po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a parti&s;an of France,
which was in alliance with the Grand Signor. He, there|fore,
<PB N="300" REF="304">
intere&s;ted him&s;elf warmly in the di&s;pute, and ordered
his general to a&s;&s;emble an army on the frontiers of Lithua+nia,
which, by over-awing the Poles that were in th$
intere&s;t of the Prince of Conti, con&s;iderably influenced th$
election. This extraordinary legi&s;lator, who was $word$
&s;trange compound of heroi&s;m and barbarity, con&s;cious $word$
the defects in his education, and of the gro&s;s ignoranc$
that over&s;pread his dominions, re&s;olved to extend hi$
ideas, and improve his judgement, by travelling; an$
that he might be the le&s;s re&s;tricted by forms, or inter+rupted
by officious curio&s;ity, he determined to travel i$
di&s;gui&s;e. He was extremely ambitious of becoming $word$
maritime power, and in particular of maintaining a fle$
in the Black-&s;ea; and his immediate aim was to learn th$
principles of &s;hip-building. He appointed an emba&s;&s;y fo$
Holland, to regulate &s;ome points of commerce with th$
States-General. Having entru&s;ted the care of his dom+nions
to per&s;ons in whom he could confide, he now di$+gui&s;ed
him&s;elf, and travelled as one of their retinue. H$
fir&s;t di&s;clo&s;ed him&s;elf to the Elector of Brandenburgh i$
Pru&s;&s;ia, and afterwards to King William, with whom h$
conferred in private at Utrecht. He engaged him&s;elf as $word$
common labourer with a &s;hip-carpenter in Holland, who$
he &s;erved for &s;ome months with wonderful patience an$
a&s;&s;iduity. He afterwards vi&s;ited England, where h$
a$u&s;ed him&s;elf chiefly with the &s;ame kind of occupatio$
From thence he &s;et out for Vienna, where receiving a$+vices
from his dominions, that his &s;i&s;ter was concerned i$
managing intrigues again&s;t his government, he returne$
&s;uddenly to Mo&s;cow, and found the machinations of th$
con&s;pirators were already baffled by the vigilance an$
fidelity of the foreigners to whom he had left the care $word$
the admini&s;tration. His &s;avage nature, however, brok$
out upon this occa&s;ion: he ordered &s;ome hundreds to $word$
hanged all round his capital; and a good number we$
beheaded, he him&s;elf with his own hand performing t$
office of executioner.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="305">
&sect; LIII. The negociations at Ry&s;wick proceeded very
&s;lowly for &s;ome time. The Imperial mini&s;ters demanded,
that France &s;hould make re&s;titution of all the places and
dominions &s;he had wre&s;ted from the empire &s;ince the
peace of Mun&s;ter, whether by force of arms or pretence
of right. The Spaniards claimed all they could demand
by virtue of the peace of Nimeguen and the treaty of the
Pyrannees. The French affirmed, that if the preliminaries
offered by Callieres were accepted, the&s;e propo&s;itions
could not to be taken into con&s;ideration. The Imperiali&s;ts
per&s;i&s;ted in demanding a circum&s;tantial an&s;wer, article by
article. The Spaniards in&s;i&s;ted upon the &s;ame manner of
proceeding, and called upon the mediator and Dutch mi|ni&s;ters
to &s;upport their preten&s;ions. The plenipotentia|ries
of France declared, they would not admit any demand
or propo&s;ition, contrary to the preliminary articles: but
were willing to deliver in a project of peace, in order to
&s;horten the negociation; and the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;adors
con&s;ented to this expedient. During the&s;e tran&s;actions the
Earl of Portland held a conference with Mare&s;chal Boufflers,
near Halle, in &s;ight of the two oppo&s;ite armies, which
was continued in five &s;ucce&s;&s;ive meetings. On the &s;econd
day of Augu&s;t they retired together to a hou&s;e in the
&s;uburbs of Halle, and mutually &s;igned a paper, in which the
principal articles of the peace between France and Eng|land
were adju&s;ted. Next day King William quitted the
camp, and retired to his hou&s;e at Loo, confident of
having taken &s;uch mea&s;ures for a pacification as could not
be di&s;appointed. The &s;ubject of this field negociation is
&s;aid to have turned upon the intere&s;ts of King James,
which the French monarch promi&s;ed to abandon: others,
however, &s;uppo&s;e, that the fir&s;t foundation of the parti|tion
treaty was laid in this conference. But, in all pro|bability,
William's &s;ole aim was to put an end to an ex|pen&s;ive
and un&s;ucce&s;sful war, which had rendered him very
unpopular in his own dominions, and to obtain from the
court of France an acknowledgement of his title, which
had &s;ince the Queen's death become the &s;ubject of di&s;|pute.
<PB N="302" REF="306">
He perceived the Emperor's backwardne&s;s towards
a pacification, and fore&s;aw numberle&s;s difficulties in di&s;|cu&s;&s;ing
&s;uch a complication of intere&s;ts by the common
method of treating: he, therefore, cho&s;e &s;uch a &s;tep as he
thought would alarm the jealou&s;y of the allies, and quicken
the negociation at Ry&s;wick. Before the congre&s;s was
opened, King James had publi&s;hed two manife&s;toes, ad|dre&s;&s;ed
to the catholick and prote&s;tant princes of the con|federacy,
repre&s;enting his wrongs, and craving redre&s;s;
but his remon&s;trances being altogether di&s;regarded, he
afterwards i&s;&s;ued a third declaration, &s;olemnly prote&s;ting
again&s;t all that might or &s;hould be negociated, regulated,
or &s;tipulated with the u&s;urper of his realms, as being void
of all rightful and lawful authority. On the twentieth
day of July the French amba&s;&s;adors produced their pro|ject
of a general peace, declaring at the &s;ame time, that
&s;hould it not be accepted before the la&s;t day of Augu&s;t,
France would not hold her&s;elf bound for the conditions
&s;he now offered: but Caunitz, the Emperor's plenipotentia|ry,
prote&s;ted he would pay no regard to this limitation.
On the thirtieth of Augu&s;t, however, he delivered to the
mediatour an ultimatum, importing, That he adhered to
the treaties of We&s;tphalia and Nimegeun, and accepted
of Stra&s;bourg with its appurtenances: That he in&s;i&s;ted up|on
the re&s;titution of Lorraine to the prince of that name;
and demanded, That the church and chapter of Liege
&s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their inconte&s;|table
rights. Next day the French plenipotentiaries de|clared,
That the month of Augu&s;t being now expired, all
their offers were vacated: That, therefore, the King of
France would re&s;erve Stra&s;bourg and unite it, with its de|pendencies,
to his crown for ever: that in other re&s;pects
he would adhere to the project, and re&s;tore Barcelona to
the crown of Spain; but that the&s;e terms mu&s;t be accept|ed
in twenty days, otherwi&s;e he &s;hould think him&s;elf at
liberty to recede. The mini&s;ters of the electors and princes
of the empire joined in a written remon&s;trance to the
Spani&s;h plenipotentiaries, repre&s;enting the inconveniencies
<PB N="303" REF="307">
and dangers that would accrue to the Germanick body
from France's being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Luxembourg, and ex|$orting
them in the &s;tronge&s;t terms to reject all offers of
$n equivalent for that province. They likewi&s;e pre&s;ented
another to the States-General, requiring them to continue
the war, according to their engagements, until France
&s;hould have complied with the preliminaries. No regard,
however, was paid to either of the&s;e addre&s;&s;es. Then the
Imperial amba&s;&s;adors demanded the good offices of the me|diatour,
on certain articles: but all that he could obtain
of France was, that the term for adju&s;ting the peace be|tween
her and the Emperor &s;hould be prolonged till the
fir&s;t day of November, and in the mean time an armi&s;|$ice
be punctually ob&s;erved. Yet even the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions
were made, on condition that the treaty with England,
Spain, and Holland &s;hould be &s;igned on that day,
even though the Emperor and empire &s;hould not con|cur.</P>
<P>&sect; LIV. Accordingly, on the twentieth day of Septem|ber,
the articles were &s;ub&s;cribed by the Dutch, Engli&s;h,
Spani&s;h, and French amba&s;&s;adors, while the Imperial
mini&s;ters prote&s;ted again&s;t the tran&s;action, ob&s;erving, this
was the &s;econd time that a &s;eparate peace had been con|cluded
with France; and that the &s;tates of the empire,
who had been impo&s;ed upon through their own credulity,
would not for the future be &s;o ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to engage
in confederacies. In certain preparatory articles &s;ettled be|tween
England and France, King William promi&s;ed to
pay a yearly pen&s;ion to Queen Mary D'E&s;te, of fifty thou|&s;and
pounds, or &s;uch &s;um as &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed for
that purpo&s;e by act of parliament. The treaty it&s;elf con&s;i&s;t|ed
of &s;eventeen articles. The French King engaged,
that he would not di&s;turb or di&s;quiet the King of Great
Britain in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his realms or government: nor
a&s;&s;i&s;t his enemies, nor favour con&s;piracies again&s;t his per|&s;on.
This obligation was reciprocal. A free commerce was
re&s;tored. Commi&s;&s;aries were appointed to meet at Lon|don,
<PB N="304" REF="308">
and &s;ettle the preten&s;ions of each crown to Hud&s;on's
Bay, taken by the French during the late peace, an$
retaken by the Engli&s;h in the cour&s;e of the war; and t$
regulate the limits of the places to be re&s;tored, as well a
the exchanges to be made. It was likewi&s;e &s;tipulated
That, in ca&s;e of a rupture, &s;ix months &s;hould be allowe$
to the &s;ujects of each power for removing their effects&punc;
That the &s;eparate article of the treaty of Nimeguen, re+lating
to the principality of Orange, &s;hould be entirely
executed; and, That the ratifications &s;hould be exchange$
in three weeks from the day of &s;igning. The treaty be+tween
France and Holland imported a general armi&s;tice, $word$
perpetual amity, a mutual re&s;titution, a reciprocal renun|ciation
of all preten&s;ions upon each other, a confirmation
of the peace with Savoy, a re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the treaty
concluded between France and Brandenburgh, in the yea$
one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy-nine, a comprehen|&s;ion
of Sweden, and all tho&s;e powers that &s;hould be named
before the ratification, or in &s;ix months after the conclu|&s;ion
of the treaty. Be&s;ides the Dutch mini&s;ter conclu|ded
a treaty of commerce with France, which was imme|diately
put in execution. Spain had great rea&s;on to be
&s;atisfied with the pacification, by which &s;he recovered
Gironne, Ro&s;e&punc;s, Barcelona, Luxembourg, Charleroy,
Mons, Courtray, and all the towns, fortre&s;&s;es, and ter|ritories
taken by the French in the province of Luxem|bourg,
Namur, Brabant, Flanders, and Hainault, except
eighty-two towns and villages claimed by the French: this
di&s;pute was left to the deci&s;ion of commi&s;&s;aries; or, in
ca&s;e they &s;hould not agree, to the determination of the
States-General. A remon&s;trance in favour of the French
prote&s;tant refugees in England, Holland, and Germany,
was delivered by the Earl of Pembroke to the mediator, in
the name of the prote&s;tant allies, on the day that preceded
the conclu&s;ion of the treaty; but the French plenip$ten|tiaries
declared, in the name of their ma&s;ter, that $word$ he
did not pretend to pre&s;cribe rules to King William
<PB N="305" REF="309">
about the Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, he expected the &s;ame liberty
with re&s;pect to his own. No other effort was made
in behalf of tho&s;e con&s;cientious exiles: the treaties were
ratified, and the peace proclaimed at Paris and London.</P>
<P>&sect; LV. The Emperor &s;till held out, and perhaps was
encouraged to per&s;evere in his ob&s;tinacy by the &s;ucce&s;s of
his arms in Hungary, where his general, Prince Eugene
of Savoy, obtained a complete victory at Zenta over the
forces of the Grand Signor, who commanded his army
in per&s;on. In this battle, which was fought on the
eleventh day of September, the Grand Vi&s;ir, the Agra of
the Jani&s;&s;aries, &s;even-and-twenty ba&s;haws, and about
thirty thou&s;and men, were killed or drowned in the river
They&s;&s;e: &s;ix thou&s;and were wounded or taken, together
with all their artillery, tents, baggage, provi&s;ion, and am|munition,
the Grand Signor him&s;elf e&s;caping with diffi|culty:
a victory the more glorious and acceptable, as the
Turks had a great &s;uperiority in point of number, and as
the Imperiali&s;ts did not lo&s;e a thou&s;and men during the
whole action. The Emperor perceiving that the event of
this battle had no effect in retarding the treaty, thought
proper to make u&s;e of the armi&s;tice, and continue the ne|gociation
after the forementioned treaties had been &s;igned.
This was likewi&s;e the ca&s;e with the princes of the empire;
though tho&s;e of the prote&s;tant per&s;ua&s;ion complained, that
their intere&s;t was neglected. In one of the articles of the
treaty, it was &s;tipulated, that in the places to be re&s;tored
by France, the Roman catholick religion &s;hould continue
as it had been re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. The amba&s;&s;adors of the
prote&s;tant princes joined in a remon&s;trance, demanding,
That the Lutheran religion &s;hould be re&s;tored in tho&s;e
places where it had formerly prevailed; but this demand
was rejected, as being equally di&s;agreeable to France and
the Emperor. Then they refu&s;ed to &s;ign the treaty, which
was now concluded between France, the Emperor, and
the catholick princes of the empire. By this pacification,
Triers, the Palatinate, and Lorraine, were re&s;tored to their
re&s;pective owners. The countries of Spanheim and Vel|dentz,
together with the duchy of Deux Ponts, were
<PB N="306" REF="310">
ceded to the King of Sweden. Francis Louis Palatine
was confirmed in the Electorate of Cologn; and Cardinal
Fur&s;temberg re&s;tored to all his rights and benefices. The
claims of the Duche&s;s of Orleans upon the Palatinate were
referred to the arbitration of France and the Emperor;
and in the mean time the Elector Palatine agreed to &s;upply
her highne&s;s with an annuity of one hundred thou&s;and
florins. The mini&s;ters of the prote&s;tant princes publi&s;hed
a formal declaration again&s;t the clau&s;e relating to religion,
and afterwards &s;olemnly prote&s;ted again&s;t the manner in
which the negociation had been conducted. Such was the
i&s;&s;ue of a long and bloody war, which had drained England
of her wealth and people, almo&s;t entirely ruined her com|merce,
debauched her morals, by encouraging venality and
corruption, and entailed upon her the cur&s;e of foreign con|nexions,
as well as a national debt, which was gradually
increa&s;ed to an intolerable burthen. After all the blood
and trea&s;ure which had been expended, William's am|bition
and revenge remained un&s;atisfied. Neverthele&s;s,
he reaped the &s;olid advantage of &s;eeing him&s;elf firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
on the Engli&s;h throne; and the confederacy,
though not &s;ucce&s;sful in every in&s;tance, accompli&s;hed
their great aim of putting a &s;top to the encroachments of
the French monarch. They mortified his vanity, they
humbled his pride and arrogance, and compelled him to
di&s;gorge the acqui&s;itions which, like a robber, he had made
in violation of publick faith, ju&s;tice, and humanity. Had
the allies been true to one another; had they acted from
genuine zeal for the common intere&s;ts of mankind; and
pro&s;ecuted with vigour the plan which was originally con|certed,
Louis would in a few campaigns have been re|duced
to the mo&s;t abject &s;tate of di&s;grace, de&s;pondence,
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; for he was de&s;titute of true courage and
magnanimity. King William having fini&s;hed this im|portant
tran&s;action, returned to England about the middle
of November, and was received in London, amid&s;t the
acclamations of the people, who now again hailed him
as their deliverer from a war, by the continuance of
which they mu&s;t have been infallibly beggared.</P>

&sect; I. WHEN the King opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parlia|ment
on the third day of December,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. 1695.</NOTE> he told
them the war was brought to the end they all propo&s;ed,
namely, an honourable peace. He gave them to under|&s;tand
there was a con&s;iderable debt on account of the
fleet and army: that the revenues of the crown had been
anticipated: he expre&s;&s;ed his hope, that they would pro|vide
for him during his life, in &s;uch a manner as would
conduce to his own honour, and that of the government.
He recommended the maintenance of a con&s;iderable navy;
and gave it as his opinion, that for the pre&s;ent England
could not be &s;afe without a &s;tanding army. He promi&s;ed
to rectify &s;uch corruptions and abu&s;es as might have crept
into any part of the admini&s;tration during the war; and
effectually to di&s;courage prophanene&s;s and immorality.
Finally, he a&s;&s;ured them, that as he had re&s;cued their re|ligion,
laws, and liberties, when they were in the extreme&s;t
danger, &s;o he &s;hould place the glory of his reign in pre|&s;erving
and leaving them entire to late&s;t po&s;terity. To
this &s;peech the Commons replied in an addre&s;s, by a com|pliment
of congratulation upon the peace, and an a&s;&s;urance,
that they would be ever ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport his
Maje&s;ty, who had confirmed them in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of their rights and liberties, and by putting an end to the
war fully completed the work of their deliverance. Not|with&s;tanding
the&s;e appearances of good-humour, the ma|jority
of the Hou&s;e, and indeed of the whole nation, were
equally alarmed and exa&s;perated at a project for maintain|ing
a &s;tanding army, which was countenanced at court,
and even recommended by the King, in his &s;peech to the
parliament. William's genius was altogether military. He
could not bear the thoughts of being a king without power.
He could not without reluctance di&s;mi&s;s tho&s;e officers who
had given &s;o many proofs of their courage and fidelity.
He did not think him&s;elf &s;afe upon the naked throne, in a
<PB N="310" REF="314">
kingdom that &s;warmed with malcontents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1697.</NOTE> who had &s;o often
con&s;pired again&s;t his per&s;on and government. He dreaded
the ambition and known perfidy of the French King, who
&s;till retained a powerful army. He fore&s;aw that a reduction
of the forces would le&s;&s;en his importance both at home and
abroad; dimini&s;h the dependence upon his government; and
di&s;per&s;e tho&s;e foreigners in who&s;e attachment he chiefly
confided. He communicated his &s;entiments on this &s;ubject
to his confident, the Earl of Sunderland, who knew by
experience the aver&s;ion of the people to a &s;tanding army;
neverthele&s;s, encouraged him with hope of &s;ucce&s;s, on the
&s;uppo&s;ition that the Commons would &s;ee the difference
between an army rai&s;ed by the King's private authority,
and a body of veteran troops maintained by con&s;ent of
parliament for the Security of the kingdom. This was a
di&s;tinction to which the people paid no regard. All the
jealou&s;y of former parliaments &s;eemed to be rou&s;ed by the
bare propo&s;al; and this was inflamed by a national pre|judice
again&s;t the refugees, in who&s;e favour the King had
betrayed repeated marks of partial indulgence. They
were &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, tractable, and wholly dependent upon his
will and genero&s;ity. The Jacobites failed not to cheri&s;h
the &s;eeds of di&s;&s;atisfaction, and reproach the Whigs who
countenanced this mea&s;ure. They branded that party
with apo&s;tacy from their former principles. They ob|&s;erved,
that the very per&s;ons who in the late reigns en|deavoured
to abridge the prerogative, and deprive the
King of that &s;hare of power which was ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary
to actuate the machine of government, were now be|come
advocates for maintaining a &s;tanding army in time
of peace; nay, and impudently avowed, that their com|plai&s;ance
to the court in this particular was owing to
their de&s;ire of excluding from all &s;hare in the admini&s;tration
a faction di&s;affected to his Maje&s;ty, which might mi&s;lead
him into more pernicious mea&s;ures. The majority of
tho&s;e who really entertained Revolution principles oppo&s;ed
the court, from apprehen&s;ions that a &s;tanding army once
e&s;tabli&s;hed would take root, and grow into an habitual
maxim of government: that, &s;hould the people be di&s;armed,
<PB N="311" REF="315">
and the &s;word left in the hands of mercenaries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. 1697.</NOTE> the liber|ties
of the nation mu&s;t be entirely at the mercy of him by
whom tho&s;e mercenaries &s;hould be commanded. They
might over-awe elections, dictate to parliaments, and e&s;ta|bli&s;h
a tyranny, before the people could take any mea&s;ures
for their own protection. They could not help thinking
it was po&s;&s;ible to form a militia, that with the concurrence
of a fleet might effectually protect the kingdom from the
dangers of an inva&s;ion. They firmly believed, that a
militia might be regularly trained to arms, &s;o as to acquire
the dexterity of profe&s;&s;ed &s;oldiers; and they did not doubt
they would &s;urpa&s;s tho&s;e hirelings in courage, con&s;idering
that they would be animated by every concurring motive
of intere&s;t, &s;entiment, and affection. Nay, they argued,
that Britain, &s;urrounded as it was by a boi&s;terous &s;ea, &s;e|cured
by floating bulwarks, abounding with &s;tout and
hardy inhabitants, did not de&s;erve to be free, if her &s;ons
could not protect their liberties without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
mercenaries, who were indeed the only &s;laves of the king|dom.
Yet, among the genuine friends of their country,
&s;ome individuals e&s;pou&s;ed the oppo&s;ite maxims. They
ob&s;erved that the military &s;y&s;tem of every government in
Europe was now altered: that war was become a trade,
and di&s;cipline a &s;cience not to be learned but by tho&s;e who
made it their &s;ole profe&s;&s;ion: that, therefore, while
France kept up a large &s;tanding army of veterans, ready
to embark on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t, it would be ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary, for the &s;afety of the nation, to maintain a &s;mall
&s;tanding force, which would be voted in parliament from
year to year. They might have &s;ugge&s;ted another expe|dient,
which in a few years would have produced a mi|litia
of di&s;ciplined men. Had the &s;oldiers of this &s;mall
&s;tanding army been inli&s;ted for a term of years, at the expi|ration
of which they might have claimed their di&s;charge,
volunteers would have offered them&s;elves from all parts of
the kingdom, even from the de&s;ire of learning the u&s;e and
exerci&s;e of arms, the ambition of being concerned in
&s;cenes of actual &s;ervice, and the chagrin of little di&s;ap|pointments
<PB N="312" REF="316">
or temporary di&s;gu&s;ts, which yet would not
have impelled them to inli&s;t as &s;oldiers on the common
terms of perpetual &s;lavery. In con&s;equence of &s;uch a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,
the whole kingdom would &s;oon have been &s;tocked
with members of a di&s;ciplined militia, equal, if not &s;uperior
to any army of profe&s;&s;ed &s;oldiers. But this &s;cheme would
have defeated the purpo&s;e of the government, which was
more afraid of dome&s;tick foes than of foreign enemies;
and indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided every plan of this nature, which
could contribute to render the malcontents of the nation
more formidable.</P>
<P>&sect; II. Before we proceed to the tran&s;actions of parliament
in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, it may not be ami&s;s to &s;ketch the out-lines
of the mini&s;try, as it &s;tood at this juncture. The King's
affection for the Earl of Portland had begun to abate, in
proportion as his e&s;teem for Sunderland increa&s;ed, together
with his con&s;ideration for Mrs. Villiers, who had been di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by &s;ome particular marks of his Maje&s;ty's favour.
The&s;e two favourites are &s;aid to have &s;upplanted Portland,
who&s;e place in the King's bo&s;om was now filled by Van Kep|pel,
a gentleman of Guelderland, who had fir&s;t &s;erved his
Maje&s;ty as a page, and afterwards acted as a private &s;ecretary.
The Earl of Portland growing trouble&s;ome, from his jea|lou&s;y
of this rival, the King re&s;olved to &s;end him into ho|nourable
exile, in quality of an amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary
to the court of France; and Trumball, his friend and crea|ture,
was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the office of &s;ecretary, which the
King conferred upon Vernon, a plodding man of bu&s;ine&s;s,
who had acted as under &s;ecretary to the Duke of Shrew&s;|bury.
This nobleman rivalled the Earl of Sunderland in
his credit at the council board, and was &s;upported by
Somers, Lord-Chancellor of England, by Ru&s;&s;el, now
Earl of Orford, Fir&s;t Lord of the Admiralty, and Montagu,
Chancellor of the Exchequer. Somers was an upright
judge, a plau&s;ible &s;tate&s;man, a con&s;ummate courtier, affable,
mild, and in&s;inuating. Orford appears to have been
rough, turbulent, factious, and &s;hallow. Montagu had
di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf early by his poetical genius; but he
<PB N="313" REF="317">
$on converted his attention to the cultivation of more
$olid talents. He rendered him&s;elf remarkable for his elo|$uence,
di&s;cernment, and knowledge of the Engli&s;h con|$$itution.
To a delicate ta&s;te, he united an eager appetite
$or political &s;tudies. The fir&s;t catered for the enjoyments
of fancy: the other was &s;ub&s;ervient to his ambition. He,
$t the &s;ame time, was the di&s;tingui&s;hed encourager of the
$iberal arts, and the profe&s;&s;ed patron of projectors. In his
$rivate deportment he was liberal, ea&s;y, and entertaining:
$s a &s;tate&s;man, bold, dogmatical, and a&s;piring.</P>
<P>&sect; III. The terrours of a &s;tanding army had produced
&s;uch an univer&s;al ferment in the nation, that the depen|dents
of the court in the Hou&s;e of Commons dur&s;t not openly
oppo&s;e the reduction of the forces: but they &s;hifted the
battery, and employed all their addre&s;s in per&s;uading the
Hou&s;e to agree, that a very &s;mall number &s;hould be retain|ed.
When the Commons voted, That all the forces
rai&s;ed &s;ince the year one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and eighty
&s;hould be di&s;banded, the courtiers de&s;ired the vote
might be recommitted, on pretence that it re&s;trained the
King to the old Tory regiments, on who&s;e fidelity he
could not rely. This motion, however, was over-ruled
by a con&s;iderable majority. Then they propo&s;ed an amend|ment,
which was rejected, and afterwards moved, That
the &s;um of five hundred thou&s;and pounds per annum &s;hould
be granted for the maintenance of guards and garri&s;ons.
This provi&s;ion would have maintained a very con&s;iderable
number; but they were again di&s;appointed, and fain to
embrace a compo&s;ition with the other party, by which
three hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds were allotted for
the maintenance of ten thou&s;and men; and they after|wards
obtained an addition of three thou&s;and marines. The
King was extremely mortified at the&s;e re&s;olutions of the
Commons; and even declared to his particular friends,
that he would never have intermeddled with the affairs of
the nation, had he fore&s;een they would make &s;uch returns
of ingratitude and di&s;tru&s;t. His di&s;plea&s;ure was aggra|vated
by the re&s;entment expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t Sunderland, who
<PB N="314" REF="318">
was &s;uppo&s;ed to have advi&s;ed the unpopular mea&s;ure of
retaining a &s;tanding army. This nobleman, dreading the
vengeance of the Commons, re&s;olved to avert the fury of
the impending &s;torm, by re&s;igning his office, and retiring
from court, contrary to the intreaties of his friends, and
the earne&s;t de&s;ire of his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. The Hou&s;e of Commons, in order to &s;weeten
the unpalatable cup they had pre&s;ented to the King, voted
the &s;um of &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds per annum for
the &s;upport of the civil li&s;t, di&s;tinct from all other &s;ervices.
Then they pa&s;&s;ed an act prohibiting the currency of &s;ilvered
hammered coin, including a clau&s;e for making out new
Exchequer bills, in lieu of tho&s;e which were or might be
filled up with endor&s;ements: they framed another to open
the core&s;pondence with France, under variety of provi&s;os:
a third for continuing the impri&s;onment of certain per&s;ons
who had been concerned in the late con&s;piracy: a fourth
granting further time for admini&s;tering oaths with re&s;pect
to tallies and orders in the Exchequer and Bank of Eng|land.
The&s;e bills having received the royal a&s;&s;ent, they
re&s;olved to grant a &s;upply, which, together with the funds
already &s;ettled for that purpo&s;e, &s;hould be &s;ufficient to
an&s;wer and cancel all Exchequer bills, to the amount of
two millions &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds. Another
&s;upply was voted for the payment and reduction of the
army, including half-pay to &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion officers as
were natural-born &s;ubjects of England. They granted
one million four hundred thou&s;and pounds, to make good
deficiencies. They re&s;olved, That the &s;um of two millions
three hundred and forty-eight thou&s;and one hundred and
two pounds was nece&s;&s;ary to pay off arrears, &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, con|tingencies,
general-officers, guards, and garri&s;ons, of which
&s;um eight hundred and fifty-five thou&s;and five hundred
and two pounds remained in the hands of the payma&s;ter.
Then they took into con&s;ideration the &s;ub&s;idies due to
foreign powers, and the &s;ums owing to contractors
for bread and forage. Examining further the debts of the
nation, they found the general debt of the navy amounted
<PB N="315" REF="319">
to one million three hundred and ninety two thou&s;and, &s;e|ven
hundred and forty-two pounds. That of the Ordnance
was equal to two hundred and four thou&s;and, one hundred
and fifty-&s;even pounds. The tran&s;port debt contracted
for the reduction of Ireland, and other &s;ervices, did not fall
&s;hort of four hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix thou&s;and, four hundred
and ninety-three pounds; and they owed nine-and-forty
thou&s;and, nine hundred and twenty-nine pounds, for
quartering and clothing the army, which had been rai&s;ed
by one act of parliament in the year 1677, and di&s;banded
by another in the year 1679. As this enormous load of
debt could not be di&s;charged at once, the Commons pa&s;&s;ed
a number of votes for rai&s;ing &s;ums of money, by which it
was con&s;iderably lightened; and &s;ettled the funds for
tho&s;e purpo&s;es by the continuation of the land-tax and
other impo&s;itions. With re&s;pect to the civil li&s;t, it was
rai&s;ed by a new &s;ub&s;idy of tonnage and poundage, the he|reditary,
and temporary exci&s;e, a weekly portion from the
revenue of the po&s;t-office, the fir&s;t-fruits and tenths of
the clergy, the fines in the alienation-office, and po&s;t-fines,
the revenue of the wine-licen&s;e, money ari&s;ing by &s;heriffs,
pro&s;&s;ers, and compo&s;itions in the Exchequer, and &s;ei&s;ures,
the income of the Duchy of Cornwall, the rents of all other
crown-lands in England or Wales, and the duty of four
and a half per cent. upon &s;pecie from Barbadoes and the
Leeward-i&s;lands. The bill imported, that the overplus
ari&s;ing from the&s;e funds &s;hould be accounted for to parlia|ment.
Six hundred thou&s;and pounds of this money was
allotted for the purpo&s;es of the civil li&s;t: the re&s;t was grant|ed
for the jointure of fifty thou&s;and pounds per annum, to
be paid to Queen Mary of E&s;te, according to the &s;tipulation
at Ry&s;wick; and to maintain a court for the Duke of
Glouce&s;ter, &s;on of the Prince&s;s Anne of Denmark, now
in the ninth year of his age: but the jointure was never
paid; nor would the King allow above fifteen thou&s;and
pounds per annum for the u&s;e of the Duke of Glouce&s;ter,
to whom Burnet Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury was appointed pre|ceptor.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="320">
&sect; V. The Commons having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the ways and
means for rai&s;ing the &s;upplies for the en&s;uing year, which
ro&s;e almo&s;t to five millions, took cognizance of &s;ome
fraudulent endor&s;ements of Exchequer-bills, a &s;pecies of
forgery which had been practi&s;ed by a confederacy, con|&s;i&s;ting
of Charles Duncomb, receiver-general of the Ex|ci&s;e,
Bartholomew Burton, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a place in that
branch of the revenue, John Knight, trea&s;urer of the
Cu&s;toms, and Reginald Marriot, a deputy-teller of the
Exchequer. This la&s;t became evidence, and the proof
turning out very &s;trong and full, the Hou&s;e re&s;olved to
make examples of the delinquents.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Kennet. State Tracts Burchet. Lives of the Admirals. Tindal. Ralph. Voltaire.</NOTE> Duncomb and
Knight, both members of parliament, were expelled, and
committed to the Tower: Burton was &s;ent to Newgate;
and bills of pain and penalties were ordered to be brought
again&s;t them. The fir&s;t, levelled at Duncomb, pa&s;&s;ed the
Lower-Hou&s;e, though not without great oppo&s;ition: but
was rejected in the Hou&s;e of Lords by the majority of one
voice. Duncomb, who was extremely rich, is &s;aid to
have paid dear for his e&s;cape. The other two bills met
with the &s;ame fate. The Peers di&s;charged Duncomb
from his confinement; but he was re-committed by the
Commons, and remained in cu&s;tody till the end of the
&s;e&s;&s;ion. While the Commons were employed on ways
and means, &s;ome of the members in the oppo&s;ition pro|po&s;ed,
that one-fourth part of the money ari&s;ing from
improper grants of the crown &s;hould be appropriated to
the &s;ervice of the publick, but this was a very unpalatable
expedient, as it affected not only the Whigs of King
William's reign, but al&s;o the Tories who had been grati|fied
by Charles II. and his brother. A great number of
petitions were pre&s;ented again&s;t this mea&s;ure, and &s;o many
difficulties rai&s;ed, that both parties agreed to lay it a&s;ide.
In the cour&s;e of this enquiry, they di&s;covered that one
Railton held a grant in tru&s;t for Mr. Montagu, Chan|tellor
of the Exchequer. A motion was immediately
made, that he &s;hould withdraw; but pa&s;&s;ed in the negative
by a great majority. Far from pro&s;ecuring this mini&s;ter,
<PB N="317" REF="321">
the Hou&s;e voted it was their opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. Ann. 1698.</NOTE> that Mr. Montagu,
for his good &s;ervices to the government, did de&s;erve his
Maje&s;ty's favour.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. This extraordinary vote was &s;ure pre&s;age of
&s;ucce&s;s in the execution of a &s;cheme which Montagu had
concerted again&s;t the Ea&s;t-|India company. They had been
&s;ounded about advancing a &s;um of money for the publick
&s;ervice, by way of loan, in con&s;ideration of a parliamenta|ry
&s;ettlement; and they offered to rai&s;e &s;even hundred
thou&s;and pounds on that condition: but, before they
formed this re&s;olution, another body of merchants, under
the au&s;pices of Montagu, offered to lend two millions at
eight per cent. provided they might be gratified with an
exclu&s;ive privilege of trading to the Ea&s;t-Indies. This
propo&s;al was very well received by the majority in the
Hou&s;e of Commons. A bill for this purpo&s;e was brought
in, with additional clau&s;es of regulation. A petition was
pre&s;ented by the old company, repre&s;enting their rights
and claims under &s;o many royal charters; the regard due
to the property of above a thou&s;and families intere&s;ted in
the &s;tock: as al&s;o to the company's property in India,
amounting to forty-four thou&s;and pounds of yearly revenue.
They alledged they had expended a million in fortifications,
that during the war they had lo&s;t twelve great &s;hips, worth
fifteen hundred thou&s;and pounds: that &s;ince the la&s;t &s;ub|&s;cription
they had contributed two hundred and ninety|five
thou&s;and pounds to the Cu&s;toms, with above eighty-five
thou&s;and pounds in taxes: that they had furni&s;hed
&s;ix thou&s;and barrels of gunpowder on a very pre&s;&s;ing oc|ca&s;ion;
and eighty thou&s;and pounds for the circulation
of Exchequer bills, at a very critical juncture, by de&s;ire of
the Lords of the Trea&s;ury, who owned that their com|pliance
was a very important &s;ervice to the government.
No regard being paid to their remon&s;trance, they under|took
to rai&s;e the loan of two millions, and immediately
&s;ub&s;cribed two hundred thou&s;and pounds as the fir&s;t pay|ment.
The two propo&s;als being compared and con&s;idered
by the Hou&s;e, the majority declared for the bill, which
<PB N="318" REF="322">
was pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;ent up to the Hou&s;e of Lords. There
the old company delivered another petition, and was heard
by coun&s;el; neverthele&s;s the bill made its way, though
not without oppo&s;ition, and a formal prote&s;tation by one-and-twenty
lords, who thought it was a hard&s;hip upon
the pre&s;ent company; and doubted whether the &s;eparate
trade allowed in the bill, concurrent with a joint-&s;tock,
might not prove &s;uch an incon&s;i&s;tency as would di&s;courage
the &s;ub&s;cription. This act, by which the whole company
was di&s;&s;olved, in a great mea&s;ure bla&s;ted the reputation
of the Whigs, which had for &s;ome time been in the de|cline
with the people. They had &s;tood up as advocates for
a &s;tanding army: they now unju&s;tly &s;uper&s;eded the Ea&s;t-India
company; they were accu&s;ed of having robbed the
publick by embezzling the national trea&s;ure, and ama&s;&s;ing
wealth by u&s;urious contracts, at the expen&s;e of their fel|low-&s;ubjects
groaning under the mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive burthens.
Certain it is, they were at this period the mo&s;t mercena|ry
and corrupt undertakers that ever had been employed
by any king or admini&s;tration &s;ince the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment
of the Engli&s;h monarchy.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. The Commons now transferred their attention
to certain objects in which the people of Ireland were in|tere&s;ted.
Colonel Mitchelborne, who had been joint go|vernour
of Londonderry with Doctor Walker, during the
&s;iege of that place, petitioned the Hou&s;e in behalf of him|&s;elf,
his officers, and &s;oldiers, to whom a con&s;iderable &s;um
of mony was due for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and the city it&s;elf im|plored
the mediation of the Commons with his Maje&s;ty,
that its &s;ervices and &s;ufferings might be taken into con|&s;ideration.
The Hou&s;e having examined the allegations
contained in both petitions, pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the
King, recommending the citizens of Londonderry to his
Maje&s;ty's favour, that they might no longer remain a rui|nous
&s;pectacle to all, a &s;corn to their enemies, and a di&s;|couragement
to well-affected &s;ubjects; they likewi&s;e de|clared,
that the governour and garri&s;on did de&s;erve &s;ome
&s;pecial marks of royal favour, for a la&s;ting monument to
<PB N="319" REF="323">
po&s;terity. To this addre&s;s the King replied, that he would
con&s;ider them, according to the de&s;ire of the Commons.
William Molineux, a gentleman of Dublin, having pub|li&s;hed
a book to prove that the kingdom of Ireland was
independent of the parliament of England, the Hou&s;e ap|pointed
a committee to enquire into the cau&s;e and na|ture
of this performance. An addre&s;s was voted to the
King, de&s;iring he would give directions for the di&s;covery
and puni&s;hment of the author. Upon the report of the
committee, the Commons in a body pre&s;ented an addre&s;s
to his Maje&s;ty, repre&s;enting the dangerous attempts which
had been lately made by &s;ome of his &s;ubjects in Ireland,
to &s;hake off their &s;ubjection and dependence upon Eng|land;
attempts which appeared not only from the bold
and pernicious a&s;&s;ertions contained in a book lately pub|li&s;hed,
but more fully and authentically by &s;ome votes
and proceedings of the Commons in Ireland. The&s;e had,
during their la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, tran&s;mitted an act for the better
&s;ecurity of his Maje&s;ty's per&s;on and government, whereby
an Engli&s;h act of parliament was pretended to be re-en|acted,
with alterations obligatory on the courts of ju&s;tice
and the great &s;eal of England. The Engli&s;h Commons,
therefore, be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty to give effectual orders
for preventing any &s;uch encroachments for the future,
and the pernicious con&s;equences of what was pa&s;t, by pu|ni&s;hing
tho&s;e who had been guilty thereof: that he would
take care to &s;ee the laws which direct and re&s;train the
parliament of Ireland punctually ob&s;erved, and di&s;courage
every thing which might have a tendency to le&s;&s;en the
dependence of Ireland upon England. This remon&s;trance
was graciou&s;ly received, and the King promi&s;ed to comply
with their reque&s;t.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. The jealou&s;y which the Commons entertained
of the government in Ireland animated them to take
other mea&s;ures, that a&s;certained the &s;ubjection of that
kingdom. Under&s;tanding that the Iri&s;h had e&s;tabli&s;hed
divers woollen manufactures, they, in another addre&s;s,
intreated his Maje&s;ty to take mea&s;ures for di&s;couraging the
<PB N="320" REF="324">
woollen manufactures in Ireland, as they interfered with tho&s;e of England, and promote the linen manufacture$
which would be profitable to both nations. At the &s;ame
time, receiving information that the French had &s;educed
&s;ome Engli&s;h manufacturers, and &s;et up a great work $word$
cloth-making in Picardy, they brought in a bill for ex|plaining
and better executing former acts for preventing
the exportation of wool, fullers-earth, and &s;couring clay
and this was immediately pa&s;&s;ed into a law. A petitio$
being pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e, by the lu&s;tring company
again&s;t certain merchants who had &s;muggled alamodes and
lu&s;trings from France, even during the war, the commit|tee
of trade was directed to enquire into the allegations
and all the &s;ecrets of this traffick were detected. Upon th$
report, the Hou&s;e re&s;olved that the manufacture of ala|modes
and lu&s;trings &s;et up in England had been beneficia$
to the kingdom: that there had been a de&s;tructive and
illegal trade carried on during the war, for importing the&s;e
commodities, by which the King had been defrauded o$
his cu&s;toms, and the Engli&s;h manufactures greatly di&s;|couraged;
that by the &s;muggling ve&s;&s;els employed in thi$
trade, intelligence had been carried into France du|ring
the war, and the enemies of the government con|veyed
from ju&s;tice. Stephen Seignoret Rhen&eacute; Baudoin$
John Goudet, Nicholas Santini, Peter de Hear&s;e, Joh$
Pierce, John Dumaitre, and David Barreau were impeached
at the bar of the Hou&s;e of Lords; and pleading guilty
the Lords impo&s;ed &s;ines upon them, according to their re|&s;pective
circum&s;tances. They were in the mean time
committed to Newgate, until tho&s;e fines &s;hould be paid
and the Commons addre&s;&s;ed the King, that the money
might be appropriated to the maintenance of Greenwich
ho&s;pital. The Hou&s;e having taken cognizance of th$
affair, and made &s;ome new regulations in the pro&s;ecutio$
of the African trade, pre&s;ented a &s;olemn addre&s;s to th$
King, repre&s;enting the general degeneracy and corruptio$
of the age, and be&s;eeching his Maje&s;ty to command a$
his judges, ju&s;tices, and magi&s;trates, to put the laws $word$
<PB N="321" REF="325">
execution again&s;t profanene&s;s and immorality. The King
profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf extremely well plea&s;ed with this remon|&s;trance,
promi&s;ed to give immediate directions for a refor|mation,
and expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ire that &s;ome more effectual
provi&s;ion might be made for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing impious books,
containing doctrines again&s;t the Trinity; doctrines which
abounded at this period, and took their origin from the
licen&s;e and profligacy of the times.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. In the mid&s;t of &s;uch immorality, Dr. Thomas
Bray, and active divine, formed a plan for propagating the
go&s;pel in foreign countries. Mi&s;&s;ionaries, catechi&s;ms,
liturgies, and other books for the in&s;truction of ignorant
people, were &s;e$t to the Engli&s;h colonies in America.
This laudable de&s;ign was &s;upported by voluntary contri|bution;
and the bill having been brought into the Hou&s;e
of Commons, for the better di&s;covery of e&s;tates given to
&s;uper&s;titious u&s;es, Dr. Bray pre&s;ented a petition, praying,
that &s;ome part of the&s;e e&s;tates might be &s;et apart for the
propagation of the reformed religion in Maryland, Vir|ginia,
and the Leeward iflands. About this period, a
&s;ociety for the reformation of manners was formed under
the King's countenance and encouragement. Con&s;iderable
collections were made for maintaining clergymen to read
prayers at certain hours in places of publick wor&s;hip, and
admini&s;ter the &s;acrament every Sunday. The members of
this &s;ociety re&s;olved to inform the magi&s;trates of all vice
and immorality that &s;hould fall under their cognizance;
and with that part of the &s;ines allowed by law to the in|former
con&s;titute a fund of charity. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the
&s;e&s;&s;ion being terminated, the King, on the third day of
July, prorogued the parliament, after having thanked
them, in a &s;hort &s;peech, for the many te&s;timonies of their
affection he had received: and in two days after the pro|rogation
it was di&s;&s;olved<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">On the fifth day of January, a fire breaking out at Whitehall, through the carele&s;sne&s;s of a laundre&s;s, the whole body of the palace, together with the new gallery, councll-chamber, and &s;everal adjoining apartments, was entirely con&s;umed; but the banqueting-hou&s;e was not affected.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; X. In the month of January, the Earl of Portland
had &s;et out on his emba&s;&s;y to France, where he was re|ceived
<PB N="322" REF="326">
with very particular marks of di&s;tinction. He made
a publick entry into Paris with &s;uch magnificence as is
&s;aid to have a&s;toni&s;hed the French nation. He interceded
for the prote&s;tants in that kingdom, again&s;t whom the
persecution had been renewed with redoubled violence:
he propo&s;ed that King James &s;hould be removed to
Avignon, in which ca&s;e his ma&s;ter would &s;upply him with
an honourable pen&s;ion: but his remon&s;trances on both
&s;ubjects proved ineffectual. Louis, however, in a private
conference with him at Marli, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have com|municated
his project of the partition-treaty. The Earl
of Portland, at his return to England, finding him&s;elf
totally eclip&s;ed in the King's favour, by Keppel, now
created Earl of Albemarle, re&s;igned his employments in
di&s;gu&s;t; nor could the King's &s;ollicitations prevail upon
him to re&s;ume any office in the hou&s;ehold; though he
promi&s;ed to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty in any other &s;hape, and was
&s;oon employed to negociate the treaty of partition. If
this nobleman mi&s;carried in the purpo&s;es of his la&s;t emba&s;&s;y
at the court of Ver&s;ailles, the agents of France were
equally un&s;ucce&s;sful in their endeavours to retrieve their
commerce with England, which the war had interrupted.
Their commi&s;&s;ary, &s;ent over to London with powers to
regulate the trade between the two nations, met with in|&s;uperable
difficulties. The parliament had burthened the
French commodities with heavy duties, which were already
appropriated to different u&s;es; and the channel of trade was
in many re&s;pects entirely altered. The Engli&s;h merchants
&s;upplied the nation with wines from Italy, Spain, and Por|tugal;
with linen from Holland and Sile&s;ia; and manufac|tures
of paper, hats, &s;tuffs, and &s;ilks, had been &s;et up and &s;uc|ce&s;sfully
carried on in England, by the French refugees.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. By this time a ferment had been rai&s;ed in Scot|land,
by the oppo&s;ition and di&s;couragements their new
company had &s;u&s;tained. They had employed agents in
England, Holland, and Hamburgh, to receive &s;ub&s;crip|tions.
The adventurers in England were intimidated by
the mea&s;ures which had been taken in parliament again&s;t
<PB N="323" REF="327">
the Scotti&s;h company. The Dutch Ea&s;t-India company
took the alarm, and exerted all their intere&s;t to prevent their
countrymen from &s;ub&s;cribing; and the King permitted
his re&s;ident at Hamburgh to pre&s;ent a memorial again&s;t
the Scotti&s;h company to the &s;enate of that city. The
parliament of Scotland being a&s;&s;embled by the Earl of
Marchmont as King's commi&s;&s;ioner, the company pre|&s;ented
it with a remon&s;trance, containing a detail of their
grievances, ari&s;ing from the conduct of the Engli&s;h Hou&s;e
of Commons, as well as from the memorial pre&s;ented by
the King's mini&s;ter at Hamburgh, in which he actually
di&s;owned the act of parliament and letters-patent which
had pa&s;&s;ed in their favour, and threatened the inhabitants
of that city with his Maje&s;ty's re&s;entment, in ca&s;e they
&s;hould join the Scots in their undertaking. They repre|&s;ented,
that &s;uch in&s;tances of interpo&s;ition had put a &s;top
to the &s;ub&s;criptions in England and Hamburgh, hurt the
credit of the company, di&s;couraged the adventurers, and
threatened the entire ruin of a de&s;ign in which all the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable families of the nation were deeply engaged.
The parliament having taken their ca&s;e into con&s;ideration,
&s;ent an addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, repre&s;enting the hard&s;hips
to which the company had been expo&s;ed, explaining how
far the nation in general was concerned in the de&s;ign, and
intreating that he would take &s;uch mea&s;ures as might
effectually vindicate the undoubted rights and privileges of
the company. This addre&s;s was &s;econded by a petition
from the company it&s;elf, praying, that his Maje&s;ty would
give &s;ome intimation to the &s;enate of Hamburgh, per|mitting
the inhabitants of that city to renew the &s;ub|&s;criptions
they had withdrawn: that, as a gracious mark
of his royal favour to the company, he would be&s;tow upon
them two &s;mal frigates, then lying u&s;ele&s;s in the harbour
of Burnt-I&s;land; and that, in con&s;ideration of the
ob&s;tructions they had encountered, he would continue
their privileges and immunities for &s;uch longer time as
&s;hould &s;eem rea&s;onable to his Maje&s;ty. Though the com|mi&s;&s;ioner
was wholly devoted to the King, who had
<PB N="324" REF="328">
actually re&s;olved to ruin this company, he could not ap|pea&s;e
the re&s;entment of the nation; and the heats in par|liament
became &s;o violent, that he was obliged to adjourn
it to the fifth day of November. In this interval, the
directors of the company, under&s;tanding from their agent
at Hamburgh that the addre&s;s of the parliament, and
their own petition, had produced no effect in their favour;
they wrote a letter of complaint to the Lord Seafield, &s;e|cretary
of &s;tate, ob&s;erving, that they had received re|peated
a&s;&s;urances of the King's having given orders to his
re&s;ident at Hamburgh touching their memorial; and in|treating
the interpo&s;ition of his lord&s;hip, that ju&s;tice might
be done to the company. The &s;ecretary, in his an&s;wer,
promi&s;ed to take the fir&s;t convenient opportunity of repre|&s;enting
the affair to his Maje&s;ty; but he &s;aid this could not
be immediately expected, as the King was much engaged
in the affairs of the Engli&s;h parliament. This declaration
the directors con&s;idered, as it really was, a mere eva&s;ion,
which helped to alienate the minds of that people from
the King's per&s;on and government.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. King William at this time revolved in his own
mind a project of far greater con&s;equence to the intere&s;t of
Europe; namely, that of &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the
throne of Spain, which in a little time would be vacated
by the death of Charles II. who&s;e con&s;titution was already
exhau&s;ted. He had been lately reduced to extremity, and
his &s;ituation was no &s;ooner known in France, than Louis
detached a &s;quadron towards Cadix, with orders to inter|cept
the plate-&s;leet, in ca&s;e the King of Spain &s;hould die
before its arrival. William &s;ent another fleet to protect
the galleons; but it arrived too late for that &s;ervice, and
the nation londly exclaimed again&s;t the tardine&s;s of the
equipment. His Catholick Maje&s;ty recovered from his
di&s;order, contrary to the expectation of his people; but
continued in &s;uch an enfeebled and precarious &s;tate of
health, that a relap&s;e was every moment apprehended. In
the latter end of July King William embarked for Hol|land,
on pretence of enjoying a rece&s;s from bu&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="325" REF="329">
which was nece&s;&s;ary to his con&s;titution. He was glad of
an opportunity to withdraw him&s;elf for &s;ome time from
a kingdom in which he had been expo&s;ed to &s;uch oppo&s;i|tion
and chagrin. But the real motive of his voyage, was
a de&s;ign of treating with the French King, remote from
the ob&s;ervation of tho&s;e who might have penetrated into
the nature of his negociation. He had appointed a regency
to govern the kingdom in his ab&s;ence, and as one of the
number nominated the Earl of Marlborough, who had
regained his favour, and been con&s;tituted governor to the
Duke of Glouce&s;ter. At his Maje&s;ty's departure, &s;ealed
orders were left with the mini&s;try, directing, that &s;ixteen
thou&s;and men &s;hould be retained in the &s;ervice, notwith|&s;tanding
the vote of the Commons, by which the &s;tand|ing
army was limited to ten thou&s;and. He alledged, that
the apprehen&s;ion of troubles which might ari&s;e at the
death of King Charles induced him to tran&s;gre&s;s this limi|tation:
and he hoped that the new parliament would be
more favourable. His enemies, however, made a fre&s;h
handle of this &s;tep, to depreciate his character in the
eyes of the people.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. Having a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the a&s;&s;embly of the States-|General,
and given audience to divers amba&s;&s;adours at the
Hague, he repaired to his Hou&s;e at Loo, attended by the
Earls of E&s;&s;ex, Portland, and Selkirk. There he was vi|&s;ited
by Count Tallard, the French mini&s;ter, who had
in&s;tructions to negociate the treaty concerning the Spa|ni&s;h
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The Earl of Portland, by his Maje&s;ty's or|der,
had communicated to Secretary Vernon the principal
conditions which the French King propo&s;ed: he him&s;elf
wrote a letter to Lord Chancellor Somers, de&s;iring his ad|vice
with regard to the propo&s;itions, and full powers under
the great &s;eal, with blanks to be filled up occa&s;ionally, that
he might immediately begin the treaty with Count Tal|lard.
At the &s;ame time, he &s;trictly enjoined &s;ecre&s;y. The
purport of Portland's letter was imparted to the Duke of
Shrew&s;bury and Mr. Montagu, who con&s;ulted with the
Chancellor and Vernon upon the &s;ubject; and the Chan|cellor
wrote an an&s;wer to the King, as the i&s;&s;ue of their
<PB N="326" REF="330">
joint deliberation: but, before it reached his Maje&s;ty, the
fir&s;t treaty of partition was &s;igned by the Earl of Portland
and Sir Jo&s;eph William&s;on. The contracting powers
agreed, That, in ca&s;e the King of Spain &s;hould die with|out
i&s;&s;ue, the kingdom of Naples and Sicily, with the
places depending on the Spani&s;h monarchy, and &s;ituated
on the coa&s;t of Tu&s;cany, or the adjacent i&s;lands, the mar|qui&s;ate
of Final, the province of Guipu&s;coa; all places on
the French &s;ide of the Pyrannees, or the other mountains
of Navarre, Alva, or Bi&s;cay, on the other &s;ide of the pro|vince
of Guipu&s;coa, with all the &s;hips, ve&s;&s;els, and &s;tores,
&s;hould devolve upon the Dauphin, in con&s;ideration of his
right to the crown of Spain, which, with all its other de|pendencies,
&s;hould de&s;cend to the Electoral Prince of
Bavaria, under the guardian&s;hip of his father: That the
duchy of Milan &s;hould be &s;ettled on the Emperor's &s;econd
&s;on, the Archduke Charles: That this treaty &s;hould be
communicated to the Emperor and the Elector of Bavaria
by the King of England and the States-General: That
if either &s;hould refu&s;e to agree to this partition, his pro|portion
&s;hould remain in &s;eque&s;tration, until the di&s;pute
could be accommodated: That in ca&s;e the Electoral Prince
of Bavaira &s;hould die before his father, then the Elector
and his other heirs &s;hould &s;ucceed him in tho&s;e domi|nions;
and, &s;hould the Archduke reject the duchy of
Milan, they agreed that it &s;hould be &s;eque&s;tered and govern|ed
by the Prince of Vaudemont. It may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob|&s;erve,
that Philip IV. father to the pre&s;ent King of Spain,
had &s;ettled his crown by will on the Emperor's children;
that the Dauphin was &s;on to Maria-There&s;a, daughter of
the &s;ame monarch, who&s;e right to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion Louis had
renounced in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner: as for the Electoral
Prince of Bavaria, he was grand&s;on to a daughter of Spain.
This treaty of partition was one of the mo&s;t impudent
&s;chemes of encroachment that tyranny and inju&s;tice ever
planned. Louis, who had made a practice of &s;acrificing
all ties of honour and good faith to the intere&s;t of his
pride, vanity, and ambition, fore&s;aw that he &s;hould never
<PB N="327" REF="331">
be able to accompli&s;h his de&s;igns upon the crown of Spain,
while William was left at liberty to form another confe|deracy
again&s;t them. He, therefore, re&s;olved to amu&s;e him
with a treaty, in which he &s;hould &s;eem to act as umpire
in the concerns of Europe. He knew that William was too
much of a politician to be re&s;tricted by notions of private
ju&s;tice; and that he would make no &s;cruple to infringe
the laws of particular countries, or even the rights of a
&s;ingle nation, when the balance of power was at &s;take.
He judged right in this particular. The King of England
lent a willing ear to his propo&s;als, and engaged in a plan
for di&s;membering a kingdom, in de&s;pite of the natives,
and in violation of every law human or divine.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. While the French King cajoled William with
this negotiation, the Marquis d'Harcourt, his amba&s;&s;ador
to Spain, was engaged in a game of a different nature at
Madrid. The Queen of Spain, &s;u&s;pecting the de&s;igns of
France, exerted all her intere&s;t in behalf of the King of
the Romans, to whom &s;he was nearly related. She new|modelled
the council, be&s;towed the government of Milan
on Prince Vaudemont, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the Prince of
He&s;&s;e d'Arm&s;tadt as viceroy of Catalonia. Notwith&s;tand|ing
all her efforts, &s;he could not prevent the French mi|ni&s;ter
from acquiring &s;ome influence in the Spani&s;h coun|cils.
He was in&s;tructed to procure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the
crown for one of the Dauphin's &s;ons, or at lea&s;t to hin|der
it from devolving upon the Emperor's children. With
a view to give weight to his negociations, the French
King ordered an army of &s;ixty thou&s;and men to advance
towards the frontiers of Catalonia and Navarre, while a
great number of &s;hips and gallies crui&s;ed along the coa&s;t,
and entered the harbours of Spain. Harcourt immediately
began to form his party: he repre&s;ented, that Philip IV.
had no power to di&s;po&s;e of his crown, again&s;t the laws of
nature and the con&s;titution of the realm: that by the
order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the crown ought to de&s;cend to the
children of his daughter, in preference to more di&s;tant
relations: that, if the Spaniards would declare in favour
<PB N="328" REF="332">
of the Dauphin's &s;econd &s;on, the Duke of Anjou, they
might train him up in the manners and cu&s;toms of their
country. When he found them aver&s;e to this propo&s;al,
he a&s;&s;ured them his ma&s;ter would approve of the Electoral
Prince of Bavaria, rather than con&s;ent to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion's
devolving upon a &s;on of the Emperor. Nay, he hinted,
that if they would choo&s;e a &s;overeign among them&s;elves,
they might depend upon the protection of his Mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, who had no other view than that of
preventing the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria from becoming too for|midable
to the liberties of Europe. The Queen of Spain
having di&s;covered the intrigues of this mini&s;ter, conveyed
the King to Toledo, on pretence that the air of Madrid
was prejudicial to his health. Harcourt immediately took
the alarm. He &s;uppo&s;ed her intention was to prevail upon
her hu&s;band, in his &s;olitude, to confirm the la&s;t will of
his father, and his doubts were all removed, when he
under&s;tood that the Count de Harrach, the Imperial am|ba&s;&s;ador,
had privately repaired to Toledo. He forthwith
took the &s;ame road, pretending to have received a memo|rial
from his ma&s;ter, with a po&s;itive order to deliver it in|to
the King's own hand. He was given to under&s;tand,
that the management of foreign affairs had been left to
the care of Cardinal Corduba at Madrid, and that the King's
health would not permit him to attend to bu&s;ine&s;s. The
purport of the memorial was, an offer of French forces to
a&s;&s;i&s;t in rai&s;ing the &s;iege of Ceuta in Barbary, which the
Moors had lately undertaken: but this offer was civilly
declined. Harcourt, not yet di&s;couraged, redoubled his
efforts at Madrid, and found means to engage Cardinal
Portocarrero in the intere&s;ts of his ma&s;ter. In the mean
time Louis concluded an alliance with Sweden, under the
pretext of pre&s;erving and &s;ecuring the common peace, by
&s;uch means as &s;hould be judged mo&s;t proper and conve|nient.
During the&s;e tran&s;actions, King William was
not wanting in his endeavours to terminate the war of
Hungary, which had raged fifteen years without inter|mi&s;&s;ion.
About the middle of Augu&s;t, Lord Paget and
<PB N="329" REF="333">
Mr. Colliers, amba&s;&s;adors from England and Holland,
arrived in the Turki&s;h camp near Belgrade; and a con|gre&s;s
being opened under their mediation, the peace of
Carlowitz was &s;igned on the twenty-&s;ixth day of January.
By this treaty, the Emperor remained in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all
his conque&s;ts: Caminieck was re&s;tored to the Poles: all
the Morea, with &s;everal fortre&s;&s;es in Dalmatia, were
ceded to the Venetians; and the Czar of Mu&s;covy re|tained
Azoph during a truce of two years; &s;o that the
Turks, by this pacification, lo&s;t great part of their Euro|pean
dominions. The Cardinal Primate of Poland, who
had &s;trenuou&s;ly adhered to the Prince of Conti, was pre|vailed
upon to acknowledge Augu&s;tus; and the commo|tions
in Lithuania being appea&s;ed, peace was e&s;tabli&s;hed
through all Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. In the beginning of December the King arrived
in England, where a new parliament had been cho&s;en, and
prorogued on account of his Maje&s;ty's ab&s;ence, which was
prolonged by contrary winds, and tempe&s;tuous weather.
His mini&s;try had been at very little pains to influence the
elections, which generally fell upon men of Revolution-principles,
though they do not &s;eem to have been much
devoted to the per&s;on of their &s;overeign: yet their choice
of Sir Thomas Lyttelton for Speaker &s;eemed to pre&s;age a
&s;e&s;&s;ion favourable to the mini&s;try. The two Hou&s;es being
convened on the &s;ixth day of December, the King, in his
&s;peech, ob&s;erved. That the &s;afety, honour, and happine&s;s
of the kingdom would in a great mea&s;ure depend upon
the &s;trength which they &s;hould think proper to maintain
by &s;ea and land. He de&s;ired they would make &s;ome fur|ther
progre&s;s in di&s;charging the national debt; contrive
effectual expedients for employing the poor; pa&s;s good
$ills for the advancement of trade, and the di&s;courage|ment
of profanity; and act with unanimity and di&s;patch.
The Commons of this new parliament were &s;o irritated at
the King's pre&s;uming to maintain a greater number of
$roops than their predece&s;&s;ors had voted, that they re&s;olved
$e &s;hould feel the weight of their di&s;plea&s;ure. They
<PB N="330" REF="334">
omitted the common compliment of an addre&s;s: they re|&s;olved
that all the forces of England, in Engli&s;h pay, ex|ceeding
&s;even thou&s;and men, &s;hould be forthwith di&s;|banded;
as al&s;o tho&s;e in Ireland, exceeding twelve thou|&s;and;
and that tho&s;e retained &s;hould be his Maje&s;ty's na|tural-born
&s;ubjects. A bill was brought in on the&s;e re&s;o|lutions,
and pro&s;ecuted with peculiar eagerne&s;s, to the
un&s;peakable mortification of King William, who was not
only extremely &s;en&s;ible of the affront, but al&s;o particularly
chagrined to &s;ee him&s;elf di&s;abled from maintaining his
Dutch guards, and the regiments of French refugees, to
which he was uncommonly attached. Before the meeting
of the parliament, the mini&s;try gave him to under&s;tand,
that they &s;hould be able to procure a vote for ten or twelve
thou&s;and; but they would not undertake for a greater
number. He profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf di&s;&s;atisfied with the pro|po&s;al,
ob&s;erving, that they might as well di&s;band the
whole, as leave &s;o few. The mini&s;ters would not run the
ri&s;que of lo&s;ing all their credit, by propo&s;ing a greater
number; and, having received no directions on this &s;ubject,
&s;at &s;ilent when it was debated in the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. Such was the indignation of William, kindled
by this conduct of his mini&s;try and his parliament, that he
threatened to abandon the government; and had actually
penned a &s;peech to be pronounced to both Hou&s;es on that
occa&s;ion: but he was diverted from this purpo&s;e by his
mini&s;try and confidents, and re&s;olved to pa&s;s the bill by
which he had been &s;o much offended. Accordingly, when
it was ready for the royal a&s;&s;ent, he went to the Hou&s;e of
Peers, where having &s;ent for the Commons, he told them,
that, although he might think him&s;elf unkindly u&s;ed, in
being deprived of his guards, which had con&s;tantly at|tended
him in all his actions: yet, as he believed nothing
could be more fatal to the nation than any di&s;tru&s;t or jea|lou&s;y
between him and his parliament, he was come to
pa&s;s the bill, according to their de&s;ire. At the &s;ame time
for his own ju&s;tification, and in di&s;charge of the tru&s;t re|po&s;ed
in him, he declared, that in his own judgement th$
<PB N="331" REF="335">
nation was left too much expo&s;ed; and that it was in|cumbent
upon them to provide &s;uch a &s;trength as might
be nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;afety of the kingdom. They thanked
him, in an addre&s;s, for his undeniable proof of his readi|ne&s;s
to comply with the de&s;ires of his parliament. They
a&s;&s;ured him, he &s;hould never have rea&s;on to think the
Commons were undutiful or unkind; for they would, on
all occa&s;ions, &s;tand by, and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the pre&s;ervation
of his &s;acred per&s;on, and in the &s;upport of his government,
again&s;t all his enemies what&s;oever. The Lords pre&s;ented
an addre&s;s to the &s;ame effect; and the King a&s;&s;ured both
Hou&s;es, he entertained no doubts of their loyalty and af|fection.
He forthwith i&s;&s;ued orders for reducing the army
to the number of &s;even thou&s;and men, to be maintained in
England under the name of guards and garri&s;ons; and,
hoping the hearts of the Commons were now mollified, he
made another effort in favour of his Dutch guards, whom
he could not di&s;mi&s;s without the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible regret.
Lord Ranelagh was &s;ent with a written me&s;&s;age to the
Commons, giving them to under&s;tand, that the nece&s;&s;ary
preparations were made for tran&s;porting the guards who
came with him into England, and that they &s;hould em|bark
immediately, unle&s;s, out of con&s;ideration to him, the
Hou&s;e &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to find a way for continuing them
longer in the &s;ervice; a favour which his Maje&s;ty would
take very kindly. The Commons, in&s;tead of complying
with his inclination, pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, in which they
profe&s;&s;ed un&s;peakable grief, that he &s;hould propo&s;e any
thing to which they could not con&s;ent with due regard to
the con&s;titution, which he had come over to re&s;tore, and
&s;o often hazarded his royal per&s;on to pre&s;erve. They re|minded
him of the declaration, in which he had promi&s;ed
that all the foreign forces &s;hould be &s;ent out of the king|dom.
They ob&s;erved, that nothing conduced more to the
happine&s;s and welfare of the nation, than an entire confi|dence
between the King and people, which could no way
be &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed as by entru&s;ting his &s;acred per&s;on
with his own &s;ubjects, who had &s;o eminently &s;ignalized

them&s;elves during the late long and expen&s;ive war. They
received a &s;oothing an&s;wer to the addre&s;s, but remained
firm to their purpo&s;e, in which the King was fain to ac|quie&s;ce;
and the Dutch guards were tran&s;ported to Hol|land.
At a time when they declared them&s;elves &s;o well
plea&s;ed with their deliverer, &s;uch an oppo&s;ition, in an
affair of very little con&s;equence, &s;avoured more of clowni&s;h
ob&s;tinacy than of patrioti&s;m. In the mid&s;t of all their
profe&s;&s;ions of regard, they entertained a national prejudice
again&s;t him&s;elf, and all the foreigners in his &s;ervice. Even
in the Hou&s;e of Commons his per&s;on was treated with great
di&s;re&s;pect in virulent in&s;inuations. They &s;ugge&s;ted, that
he neither loved nor tru&s;ted the Engli&s;h nation: that he
treated the natives with the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable re&s;erve; and
cho&s;e his confidents from the number of &s;trangers that &s;ur|rounded
him: that, after every &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, he
retired from the kingdom, to enjoy an indolent and inglo|rious
privacy with a few favourites. The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions
were certainly true. He was extremely di&s;gu&s;ted with the
Engli&s;h, whom he con&s;idered as malicious, ignorant, and
ungrateful, and he took no pains to di&s;gui&s;e his &s;enti|ments.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. The Commons having effected a di&s;&s;olution of
the army, voted fifteen thou&s;and &s;eamen, and a propor|tionable
fleet for the &s;ecurity of the kingdom: they granted
one million, four hundred and eighty-four thou&s;and fifteen
pounds, for the &s;ervices of the year, to be rai&s;ed by a tax
of three &s;hillings in the pound upon lands, per&s;onal e&s;tates,
pen&s;ions, and offices. A great number of prie&s;ts and
Roman catholicks, who had been frighted away by the
Revolution, were now encouraged by the treaty of Ry&s;wick
to return, and appeared in all public places of London
and We&s;tmini&s;ter, with remarkable effrontery. The ene|mies
of the government whi&s;pered about, that the treaty
contained a &s;ecret article in favour of tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed
that religion; and &s;ome did not even &s;cruple to in&s;inuate,
that William was a papi&s;t in his heart. The Commons
alarmed at the number and in&s;olence of tho&s;e religioni&s;ts,
<PB N="333" REF="339">
de&s;ired the King, in an addre&s;s, to remove by proclama|tion
all papi&s;ts and nonjurors from the city of London and
parts adjacent, and put the laws in execution again&s;t them,
that the wicked de&s;igns they were always hatching might be
effectually di&s;appointed. The King gratified them in their
reque&s;t of a proclamation, which was not much re|garded:
but a remarkable law was enacted again&s;t papi&s;ts
in the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ion. The old Ea&s;t-India
company, about this period, petitioned the Lower Hou&s;e,
to make &s;ome provi&s;ion that their corporation might &s;ub&s;i&s;t
for the re&s;idue of the term of twenty-one years, granted
by his Maje&s;ty's charter: that the payment of the five
pounds per cent. by the late act for &s;ettling the trade to the
Ea&s;t-Indies, might be &s;ettled and adju&s;ted in &s;uch a
manner, as not to remain a burthen on the petitioners;
and that &s;uch further con&s;iderations might be had for
their relief, and for the pre&s;ervation of the Ea&s;t-India
trade, as &s;hould be thought rea&s;onable. A bill was brought
in upon the &s;ubject of this petition; but rejected at the
&s;econd reading. Di&s;contents had ri&s;en to &s;uch a height,
that &s;ome members began to a&s;&s;ert, they were not bound
to maintain the votes and credit of the former parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Kennet. Lamberty. State Tracts Tindal. Ralph.</NOTE>
and, upon this maxim, would have contributed their in|tere&s;t
towards a repeal of the act made in favour of the
new company: but &s;uch a &s;cheme was of too dangerous
con&s;equence to the publick credit, to be carried into exe|cution.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. That &s;pirit of peevi&s;hne&s;s which could not be
gratified with this &s;acrifice, produced an enquiry into the
management of naval affairs, which was aimed at the
Earl of Orford, a nobleman who&s;e power gave umbrage,
and who&s;e wealth excited envy. He officiated both as
Trea&s;urer of the Navy, and Lord-Commi&s;&s;ioner of the
Admiralty, and &s;eemed to have forgot the &s;phere from
which he had ri&s;en to title and office.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ann. 1699.</NOTE> The Commons
drew up an addre&s;s, complaining of &s;ome unimportant
articles of mi&s;management in the conduct of the navy;
and the Earl was wi&s;e enough to avoid further pro&s;ecution,
<PB N="334" REF="340">
by re&s;igning his employments.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1699.</NOTE> On the fourth day of May
the King clo&s;ed the &s;e&s;&s;ion, with a &s;hort &s;peech, hinting
di&s;&s;atisfaction at their having neglected to con&s;ider &s;on e$word$
points which he had recommended to their attention; and
the parliament was prorogued to the fir&s;t of June<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>About the latter end of March the Earl of Warwick and Lord Mohun were tried by their peers in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, for the murther of Captain Richard Coote, who had been killed in a midnight combat of three on e$ch &s;ide.

<P>Villers, Earl of Jer&s;ey, who had been &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador to France, was ap|pointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in the room of the Duke of Shrew&s;bury. This nobleman was created lord-chamberlain: the Earl of Manche&s;ter was &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary to France: the Earl of Pembroke was declared lord-pre&s;ident of the council; and Lord Vi&s;count Lon&s;dale keeper of the privy-&s;eal.</P></NOTE>. In a
little time after this prorogation, his Maje&s;ty appointed a
regency<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Con&s;i&s;ting of the Lord-Chancellor, the Lord-Pre&s;ident, the Lord Privy Seal, the Lord-Steward of the Hou&s;ehold, the Earl of Bridgewater, $word$ commi&s;&s;ioner of the Admiralty, the Earl of Marlborough, the Earl $word$ Jer&s;ey, and Mr. Montagu.</NOTE>; and on the &s;econd day of June embarked for
Holland.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. In Ireland nothing of moment was tran&s;acted.
The parliament of that kingdom pa&s;&s;ed an act for rai&s;ing
one hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds on lands, tene|ment,
and hereditaments, to defray the expen&s;e of main|taining
twelve thou&s;and men who had been voted by the
Commons of England: then the a&s;&s;embly was prorogued.
A new commi&s;&s;ion afterwards arrived at Dublin, con&s;ti|tuting
the Duke of Bolton, the Earls of Berkeley and
Galway, lords-ju&s;tices of Ireland. The clamour in Scot|land
increa&s;ed again&s;t the mini&s;try, who had di&s;owned
their company, and in a great mea&s;ure defeated the de&s;ign
from which they had promi&s;ed them&s;elves &s;uch heaps of
trea&s;ure. Notwith&s;tanding the di&s;couragements to which
their company had bee$ expo&s;ed, they fitted out two of
four large &s;hips which had been built at Hamburgh for
their &s;ervice. The&s;e were laden with a cargo for traffick,
with &s;ome artillery and military &s;tores; and the adven|turers
embarking, to the number of twelve hundred, they
<PB N="335" REF="341">
sailed from the frith of Edinburgh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. 1699.</NOTE> with &s;ome tenders, on
the &s;eventeenth day of July in the preceding year. At
Madeira they took in a &s;upply of wine, and then &s;teered
to Crab-i&s;land in the neighbourhood of St. Thomas, lying
between Santa Cruz and Porto Rico. Their de&s;ign was
to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this little i&s;land; but, when they en|tered
the road, they &s;aw a large tent pitched upon the
&s;trand, and the Dani&s;h colours flying. Finding them|&s;elves
anticipated in this quarter, they directed their cour&s;e
to the coa&s;t of Darien, where they treated with the natives
for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their colony, and taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the ground, to which they gave the name of Caledonia,
began to execute their plan of erecting a town under the
appellation of New Edinburgh, by the direction of their
council, con&s;i&s;ting of Patter&s;on the projector, and &s;ix
other directors. They had no &s;ooner completed their
&s;ettlement, than they wrote a letter to the King, contain|ing
a detail of their proceedings. They pretended they
had received undoubted intelligence, that the French in|tended
to make a &s;ettlement on that coa&s;t; and that their
colony would be the means of preventing the evil con&s;e|quences
which might ari&s;e to his Maje&s;ty's kingdom and
dominions from the execution of &s;uch a &s;cheme. They
acknowledged his goodne&s;s in granting tho&s;e privileges by
which their company was e&s;tabli&s;hed: they implored the
continuance of his royal favour and protection, as they
had punctually adhered to the conditions of the act of par|liament
and the patent they had obtained.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. By this time, however, the King was re&s;olved
to cru&s;h them effectually. He under&s;tood that the greater
part of their provi&s;ions had been con&s;umed before they &s;et
&s;ail from Scotland, and fore&s;aw that they mu&s;t be reduced
to a &s;tarving condition, if not &s;upplied from the Engli&s;h
colonies. That they might be debarred of all &s;uch a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
he &s;ent orders to the governours of Jamaica,
and the other Engli&s;h &s;ettlements in America, to i&s;&s;ue
proclamations, prohibiting, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties,
all his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects from holding any corre&s;pondence
<PB N="336" REF="342">
with the Scotti&s;h colony, or a&s;&s;i&s;ting it, in any &s;hape, with
arms, ammunition, or provi&s;ion, on pretence that they had
not communicated their de&s;ign to his Maje&s;ty, but had
peopled Darien, in violation of the peace &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between
him and his allies. Their colony was, doubtle&s;s, a very
dangerous encroachment upon the Spaniards, as it would
have commanded the pa&s;&s;age between Porto Bello and
Panama, and divided the Spani&s;h empire in America.
The French King complained of the inva&s;ion, and offered
to &s;upply the court of Madrid with a fleet to di&s;lodge
the interlopers. Colonna Marquis de Canales, the Spa|ni&s;h
amba&s;&s;ador at the court of London, pre&s;ented a
memorial to King William, remon&s;trating again&s;t the
&s;ettlement of this colony, as a mark of di&s;regard, and a
breach of the alliance between the two crowns; and de|claring,
that his ma&s;ter would take proper mea&s;ures again&s;t
&s;uch ho&s;tilities. The Scots affirmed, that the natives of
Darien were a free people, whom the Spaniards had
in vain attempted to &s;ubdue: that, therefore, they had
an original and incontrovertible right to di&s;po&s;e of their
own lands, part of which the company had purcha&s;ed for
a valuable con&s;ideration. But there was another cau&s;e
more powerful than the remon&s;trances of the Spani&s;h
court, to which this colony fell a &s;acrifice; and that was,
the jealou&s;y of the Engli&s;h traders and planters. Darien
was &s;aid to be a country abounding with gold, which would
in a little time enrich the adventurers. The Scots were
known to be an enterpri&s;ing and pertinacious people; and
their harbour near Golden-i&s;land was already declared a
free-port. The Engli&s;h apprehended that their planters
would be allured into this new colony, by the double
pro&s;pect of finding gold, and plundering the Spaniards
that the buccaneers in particular would choo&s;e it as their
chief re&s;idence: that the plantations of England would $word$
de&s;erted: that Darien would become another Algiers$
and that the &s;ettlement would produce a rupture $word$
Spain, in con&s;equence of which the Engli&s;h effects in th$
kingdom would be con$i&s;cated. The Dutch, too, $word$
<PB N="337" REF="343">
&s;aid to have been jealous of a company, which in time
might have proved their competitors in the illicit commerce
to the Spani&s;h main; and to have hardened the King's
heart again&s;t the new &s;ettlers, whom he abandoned to their
fate, notwith&s;tanding the repeated petitions and remon|&s;trances
of their con&s;tituents. Famine compelled the fir&s;t
adventurers to quit the coa&s;t: a &s;econd recruit of men and
provi&s;ions was &s;ent thither from Scotland: but, one of
their &s;hips, laden with provi&s;ion, being burned by acci|dent,
they likewi&s;e de&s;erted the place: another re-enforce|ment
arrived, and being better provided than the two
former, might have maintained their footing; but they
were &s;oon divided into factions that rendered all their
&s;chemes abortive. The Spaniards advanced again&s;t them;
when, finding them&s;elves incapable of with&s;tanding the
enemy, they &s;ollicited a capitulation, by virtue of which
they were permitted to retire. Thus vani&s;hed all the
golden dreams of the Scotti&s;h nation, which had engaged
in this de&s;ign with incredible eagerne&s;s, and even em|barked
a greater &s;um of money than ever they had advan|ced
upon any other occa&s;ion. They were now not only
di&s;appointed in their expectations of wealth and affluence;
but a great number of families was ab&s;olutely ruined by
the mi&s;carriage of the de&s;ign, which they imputed &s;olely to
the conduct of King William. The whole kingdom of
Scotland &s;eemed to join in the clamour that was rai&s;ed
again&s;t their &s;overeign. They taxed him with double-dealing,
inhumanity, and ba&s;e ingratitude, to a people
who had lavi&s;hed their trea&s;ure and be&s;t blood in &s;upport of
his government, and in the gratification of his ambition:
and had their power been equal to their animo&s;ity, in all
probability a rebellion would have en&s;ued.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. William, mean while, enjoyed him&s;elf at Loo,
where he was vi&s;ited by the Duke of Zell, with whom he
had long cultivated an intimacy of friend&s;hip. During
his re&s;idence in this place, the Earl of Portland and the
Grand Pen&s;ionary of Holland frequently conferred with
the French amba&s;&s;ador, Count Tallard, upon the &s;ubject
<PB N="338" REF="344">
of the Spani&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The fir&s;t plan of the partition
being defeated by the death of the young Prince of Bavaria,
they found it nece&s;&s;ary to concert another, and began a
private negociation for that purpo&s;e. The court of Spain,
appri&s;ed of their intention, &s;ent a written remon&s;trance to
Mr. Stanhope, the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter at Madrid, expre&s;&s;ing
their re&s;entment at this unprecedented method of proceed|ing,
and de&s;iring that a &s;top might be put to tho&s;e intrigues,
&s;eeing the King of Spain would of him&s;elf take the nece&s;|&s;ary
&s;teps for pre&s;erving the publick tranquillity, in ca&s;e
he &s;hould die without heirs of his body. A repre&s;entation
of the &s;ame kind was made to the mini&s;ters of France and
Holland: the Marquis de Canales, the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador
at London, delivered a memorial to the lords-ju&s;tices,
couched in the mo&s;t virulent terms, again&s;t this tran&s;acti|on,
and even appealing from the King to the parliament.
This Spaniard was plea&s;ed with an opportunity to in&s;ult
King William, who hated his per&s;on, and had forbid him
the court, on account of his appearing covered in his Ma|je&s;ty's
pre&s;ence. The regency had no &s;ooner communi|cated
this paper to the King, than he ordered the amba&s;&s;a|dor
to quit the kingdom in eighteen days, and to remain
within his own hou&s;e till the time of his departure. He
was likewi&s;e given to under&s;tand, that no writing would
be received from him or any of his dome&s;ticks. Mr.
Stanhope was directed to complain at Madrid of the a&s;&s;ront
offered to his ma&s;ter, which he &s;tiled an in&s;olent and &s;aucy
attempt to &s;tir up fedition in the kingdom, by appealing
to the people and parliament of England again&s;t his Ma|je&s;ty.
The court of Spain ju&s;tified what their mini&s;ter
had done, and in their turn ordered Mr. Stanhope to leave
their dominions. Don Bernardo de Quiros, the Spani&s;h
amba&s;&s;ador in Holland, prepared a memorial on the &s;ame
&s;ubject, to the States-General; which, however, they
refu&s;ed to accept. The&s;e remon&s;trances did not interrupt
the negociation, in which Louis was &s;o eager, that he
complained of William, as if he had not employed his
whole influence in prevailing upon the Dutch to &s;ignify
<PB N="339" REF="345">
their acce&s;&s;ion to the articles agreed upon by France and
England: but his Britannick Maje&s;ty found means to re|move
this jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. About the middle of October William returned
to England, and conferred upon the Duke of Shrew&s;bury
the office of chamberlain, vacant &s;ince the re&s;ignation of
Sunderland. Mr. Montague at the &s;ame period re&s;igned
his &s;eat at the Trea&s;ury-board, together with the chancel|lor&s;hip
of the Exchequer, either fore&s;eeing uncommon
difficulty in managing a Hou&s;e of Commons, after they
had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in ill-humour, or dreading the intere&s;t
of his enemies, who might procure a vote that his two
places were incon&s;i&s;tent. The King opened the &s;e&s;&s;ion of
parliament, on the &s;ixteenth day of November, with a
long &s;peech, advi&s;ing a further provi&s;ion for the &s;afety of
the kingdom by &s;ea and land, as well as the repairs of
&s;hips and fortifications; exhorting the Commons to make
good the deficiencies of the funds, di&s;charge the debts of
the nation, and provide the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies. He recom|mended
&s;ome good bill for the more effectual preventing and
puni&s;hing unlawful and clande&s;tine trading; and expre&s;&s;ed
a de&s;ire, that &s;ome method &s;hould be taken for employing
the poor, which were become a burthen to the kingdom.
He a&s;&s;ured them, his re&s;olutions were to countenance virtue
and di&s;courage vice: and that he would decline no diffi|culties
and dangers, where the welfare and pro&s;perity of the
nation might be concerned. He concluded with the&s;e
words: &startq;Since, then our aims are only for the general
good, let us act w$$h confidence in one another; which
will not fail, with God's ble&s;&s;ing, to make me a happy
king, and you a great and flouri&s;hing people.&endq;&mdash;The
Commons were now become wanton in their di&s;gu&s;t.
Though they had received no real provocation, they re|&s;olved
to mortify him with their proceedings. They af|fected
to put odious interpretations on the very harmle&s;s
expre&s;&s;ion of, &startq;Let us act with confidence in one another.&endq;
In&s;tead of an addre&s;s of thanks, according to the u&s;ual
cu&s;tom, they pre&s;ented a &s;ullen remon&s;trance, complain|ing,
<PB N="340" REF="346">
that a jealou&s;y and di&s;gu&s;t had been rai&s;ed of their $word$
and affection; and de&s;iring he would &s;how marks of his high
di&s;plea&s;ure towards all per&s;ons who had pre&s;umed to mi&s;re|pre&s;ent
their proceedings to his Maje&s;ty. He declared, in his
an&s;wer, that no per&s;on had ever dared to mi&s;repre&s;ent their
proceedings; and, that if any &s;hould pre&s;ume to impo&s;e
upon him by &s;uch calumnies, he would treat them as his
wor&s;t enemies.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. The Hou&s;e was not in a humour to be ap|pea&s;ed
with &s;oothing promi&s;es and prote&s;tations: they
determined to di&s;tre&s;s him, by pro&s;ecuting his mini&s;ters.
During the war the colonies of North-America had grown
rich by piracy. One Kidd, the ma&s;ter of a &s;loop, under|took
to &s;uppre&s;s the pirates, provided the government
would furni&s;h him with a &s;hip of thirty guns, well manned.
The board of Admiralty declaring that &s;uch a number of
&s;eamen could not be &s;pared from the publick &s;ervice, Kidd
was equipped by the private &s;ub&s;cription of the Lord-Chan|cellor,
the Duke of Shrew&s;bury, the Earls of Romney, Or|ford,
and Bellamont, Sir Edward Harri&s;on, and Colonel
Living&s;tone, of New-York. The King promi&s;ed to con|tribute
one half of the expen&s;e, and re&s;erved to him&s;elf
one tenth of the profits; but he never advanced the mo|ney.
Kidd being thus equipped, and provided with a
commi&s;&s;ion to act again&s;t the French, as well as to make
war on certain pirates therein mentioned by name, &s;et &s;ail
from Plymouth: but, in&s;tead of crui&s;ing on the coa&s;t of
America, he directed his cour&s;e to the Ea&s;t-Indies, where
he him&s;elf turned pirate, and took a $ich &s;hip belonging to
the Moors. Having divided his booty with his crew,
ninety of whom left him, in order to join other adventu|rers,
he burned his own &s;hip, and &s;ailed with his prize to
the We&s;t-Indies. There he purcha&s;ed a &s;loop, in which
he &s;teered for North America, leaving part of his men in the
prize, to remain in one of the Leeward-i&s;lands, until they
&s;hould receive further in&s;tructions. Arriving on the coa&s;t
of New-York, he &s;ent one Emmet to make his peace with
the Earl of Bellamont, the governor of that province,
who inveigled him into a negociation, in the cour&s;e of
<PB N="341" REF="347">
which he was apprehended. Then his lord&s;hip &s;ent an
account of his proceedings to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate, de&s;iring
that he would &s;end for the pri&s;oners to England, as there
was no law in that colony for puni&s;hing piracy with
death, and the majority of the people favoured that practice.
The Admiralty, by order of the lords-ju&s;tices, di&s;patched
the &s;hip Roche&s;ter to bring home the pri&s;oners and their
effects: but, after having been to&s;&s;ed for &s;ome time with
tempe&s;tuous weather, this ve&s;&s;el was obliged to return to
Plymouth in a &s;hattered condition. This incident furni&s;hed
the malcontents with a colour to paint the mini&s;try as the
authors and abettors of a piratical expedition, which they
wanted to &s;creen from the cognizance of the publick. The
old Ea&s;t-India company had complained to the regency of
the capture made by Kidd in the Ea&s;t-Indies, apprehending,
as the ve&s;&s;el belonged to the Moors, they &s;hould be expo&s;ed
to the re&s;entment of the Mogul. In the beginning of
December, this &s;ubject being brought abruptly into the
Hou&s;e of Commons, a motion was made, That the letters
patent granted to the Earl of Bellamont and others, of pi|rates
goods, were di&s;honourable to the King, again&s;t the
laws of nations, contrary to the laws and &s;tatutes of the
land, inva&s;ive of property, and de&s;tructive of trade and com|merce.
A warm debate en&s;ued, in the cour&s;e of which,
&s;ome members declaimed with great bitterne&s;s again&s;t the
Chancellor and the Duke of Shrew&s;bury, as partners in a
piratical &s;cheme: but the&s;e imputations were refuted, and
the motion was rejected by a great majority. Not but they
might have ju&s;tly &s;tigmatized the expedition as a little
mean adventure, in which tho&s;e noblemen had embarked
with a view to their own private advantage.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. While this affair was in agitation among the
Commons, the attention of the Upper Hou&s;e was employed
upon the ca&s;e of Dr. Wat&s;on, Bi&s;hop of St. David's. This
prelate was &s;uppo&s;ed to have paid a valuable con&s;ideration
for his bi&s;hoprick: and, after his elevation, had &s;old the
preferments in his gift, with a view of being reimbur&s;ed.
He was accu&s;ed of &s;imony; and, after a &s;olemn hearing
before the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury and &s;ix &s;uffragans,
<PB N="342" REF="348">
convicted and deprived. Then he pleaded his privilege:
&s;o that the affair was brought into the Hou&s;e of Lords,
who refu&s;ed to own him as a peer after he had cea&s;ed to be
a bi&s;hop. Thus di&s;appointed, he had recour&s;e to the court
of delegates, by whom the Archbi&s;hop's &s;entence was con|firmed.
The next effort that the Commons made, with
a view of mortifying King William, was to rai&s;e a clamour
again&s;t Dr. Burnet, Bi&s;hop of Sarum. He was repre&s;ented
in the Hou&s;e as a very unfit preceptor for the Duke of
Glouce&s;ter, both as a Scotti&s;h man, and author of that
pa&s;toral letter which had been burned by order of the par|liament,
for a&s;&s;erting that William had a right to the
crown from conque&s;t. A motion was made for addre&s;&s;ing
his Maje&s;ty, that this prelate might be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his
employment, but rejected by a great majority. Burnet
had acted with uncommon on integrity in accepting the tru&s;t.
He had declined the office, which he was in a manner
forced to accept. He had offered to re&s;ign his bi&s;hoprick,
thinking the employment of a tutor would interfere with
the duty of a pa&s;tor. He in&s;i&s;ted upon the Duke's re&s;i|dence
all the &s;ummer at Wind&s;or, which is in the dioce&s;e
of Sarum; and added to his private charities the whole
income of his new office.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. The circum&s;tance on which the anti-courtiers
built their chief hope of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing or di&s;gracing the go|vernment,
was the enquiry into the Iri&s;h forfeitures, which
the King had di&s;tributed among his own dependents. The
commi&s;&s;ioners appointed by parliament to examine the&s;e
particulars, were Anne&s;ley, Trenchard, Hamilton, Lang|ford,
the Earl of Drogheda, Sir Francis Brew&s;ter, and
Sir Richard Leving. The fir&s;t four were actuated by all
the virulence of faction: the other three were &s;ecretly
guided by mini&s;terial influence. They began their enquiry
in Ireland, and proceeded with &s;uch &s;everity as &s;eemed to
&s;low rather from re&s;entment to the court, than from a love of
ju&s;tice and abhorrence of corruption. They in particular
&s;crutinized a grant of an e&s;tate which the King had made
to Mrs. Villiers, now Counte&s;s of Orkney, &s;o as to expo&s;e
<PB N="343" REF="349">
his Maje&s;ty's partiality for that favourite, and &s;ubject him
to an additional load of popular odium. In the cour&s;e of
their examination, the Earl of Drogheda, Leving, and
Brew&s;ter, oppo&s;ed the re&s;t of the commi&s;&s;ioners in divers
articles of the report, which they refu&s;ed to &s;ign, and
&s;ent over a memorial to the Hou&s;e of Commons, ex|plaining
their rea&s;ons for di&s;&s;enting from their col|leagues.
By this time, however, they were con&s;idered
as hirelings of the court, and no regard was paid to their
repre&s;entations. The others delivered their report, de|claring
that a million and a half of money might be rai&s;ed
from the &s;ale of the confi&s;cated e&s;tates; and a bill was
brought in for applying them to the u&s;e of the publick.
A motion being made to re&s;erve a third part for the King's
di&s;po&s;al, it was over-ruled: then the Commons pa&s;&s;ed an
extraordinary vote, importing, that they would not re|ceive
any petition from any per&s;on what&s;oever concerning
the grants; and that they would con&s;ider the great &s;er|vices
performed by the commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to enquire
into the forfeited e&s;tates. They re&s;olved, That the four
commi&s;&s;ioners who had &s;igned the report had acquitted
them&s;elves with under&s;tanding, courage, and integrity;
and That Sir Richard Leving, as author of groundle&s;s and
&s;candalous a&s;per&s;ions ca&s;t upon his four colleagues, &s;hould
be committed pri&s;oner to the Tower. They afterwards
came to the following re&s;olution, which was pre&s;ented to
the King in form of an addre&s;s: That the procuring and
pa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e grants had occa&s;ioned great debts upon the
nation, and heavy taxes upon the people, and highly re|flected
upon the King's honour; and, That the officers
and in&s;truments concerning the &s;ame had highly failed
in the performance of their tru&s;t and duty. The King
an&s;wered, That he was not only led by inclination, but
thought him&s;elf obliged in ju&s;tice to reward tho&s;e who had
&s;erved well in the reduction of Ireland out of the e&s;tates
forfeited to him by the rebellion in that kingdom. He
ob&s;erved, that as the long war had left the nation much in
debt, their taking ju&s;t and effectual ways for le&s;&s;ening
<PB N="344" REF="350">
that debt, and &s;upporting publick credit, was what, in his
opinion, would be&s;t contribute to the honour, intere&s;t, and
&s;afety of the kingdom. This an&s;wer kindled a flame of
indignation in the Hou&s;e. They forthwith re&s;olved,
That the advi&s;er of it had u&s;ed his utmo&s;t endeavours to
create a mi&s;under&s;tanding and jealou&s;y between the King
and his people.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. They prepared, fini&s;hed, and pa&s;&s;ed a bill
of re&s;umption. They ordered the report of the commi&s;&s;i|oners,
together with the King's promi&s;e and &s;peeches, and
the former re&s;olutions of the Hou&s;e touching the forfeited
e&s;tates in Ireland, to be printed and publi&s;hed for their
ju&s;tification; and they re&s;olved, That the procuring or
pa&s;&s;ing exorbitant grants by any member, now of the
privy-council, or by any other that had been a privy-coun&s;ellor,
in this, or any former reign, to his u&s;e of
benefit, was a high crime and mi&s;demeanour. That
ju&s;tice might be done to purcha&s;ers and creditors in the act
of re&s;umption, thirteen tru&s;tees were authori&s;ed and em|powered
to hear and determine all claims relating to tho&s;e
e&s;tates, to &s;ell them to the be&s;t purcha&s;ers; and the money
ari&s;ing from the &s;ale was appropriated to pay the arrears of
the army. It pa&s;&s;ed under the title of a bill for granting an
aid to his Maje&s;ty, by the &s;ale of forfeited and other e&s;tates
and intere&s;ts in Ireland; and that it might undergo no al|teration
in the Hou&s;e of Lords, it was con&s;olidated with the
money bill for the &s;ervices of the year. In the Hou&s;e of Lords
it produced warm debates; and &s;ome alterations were made,
which the Commons unanimou&s;ly rejected. They &s;eemed
to be now more than ever exa&s;perated again&s;t the mini&s;try,
and ordered a li&s;t of the privy-council to be laid before the
Hou&s;e. The Lords demanded conferences, which &s;erved
only to exa&s;perate the two Hou&s;es again&s;t each other; for
the Peers in&s;i&s;ted upon their amendments, and the Com|mons
were &s;o provoked at their interfering in a money-bill,
that they determined to give a loo&s;e to their re&s;entment.
They ordered all the doors of their Hou&s;e to be &s;hut,
that no members &s;hould go forth. Then they took into
<PB N="345" REF="351">
con&s;ideration the report of the Iri&s;h forfeitures, with the
li&s;t of the privy-coun&s;ellors; and a que&s;tion was moved,
That an addre&s;s &s;hould be made to his Maje&s;ty, to remove
John Lord Somers, Chancellor of England, from his pre|&s;ence
and councils for ever. This, however, was carried
in the negative by a great majority. The King was ex|tremely
chagrined at the bill, which he con&s;idered as an in|va&s;ion
of his prerogative, an in&s;ult on his per&s;on, and an
injury to his friends and &s;ervants; and he at fir&s;t re&s;olved
to hazard all the con&s;equences of refu&s;ing to pa&s;s it into
a law: but he was diverted from his purpo&s;e by the re|mon&s;trances
of tho&s;e in whom he chiefly confided. He
could not, however, di&s;&s;emble his re&s;entment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Oldmixon. Cole's Mem. State Tracts. Lamberty. Tindal. Ralph.</NOTE> He be|came
&s;ullen, peevi&s;h, and moro&s;e; and his enemies did
not fail to make u&s;e of this additional ill-humour, as a
proof of his aver&s;ion to the Engli&s;h people. Though the
motion again&s;t the Chancellor had mi&s;carried, the Commons
re&s;olved to addre&s;s his Maje&s;ty, that no per&s;on who was
not a native of his dominions, except his Royal Highne&s;s
Prince George of Denmark, &s;hould be admitted into his
Maje&s;ty's councils in England or Ireland. This re&s;olution
was levelled again&s;t the Earls of Portland, Albemarle, and
Galway: but, before the addre&s;s could be pre&s;ented, the
King went to the Hou&s;e of Peers, and having pa&s;&s;ed the
bill which had produced &s;uch a ferment, with &s;ome others,
commanded the Earl of Bridgewater, Speaker of the Hou&s;e,
in the ab&s;ence of the Chancellor, who was indi&s;po&s;ed, to
prorogue the parliament to the twenty-third day of May.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. In the cour&s;e of this &s;e&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1700.</NOTE> the Commons
having pro&s;ecuted their enquiry into the conduct of Kidd,
brought in a bill for the more effectual &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of piracy,
which pa&s;&s;ed into a law: under&s;tanding afterwards, that Kidd
was brought over to England, they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to
the King, de&s;iring that he might not be tried, di&s;charged, or
$ardoned, till the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament; and his Maje&s;|ty
complied with their reque&s;t. Boiling &s;till with indignati|on
again&s;t the Lord-Chancellor, who had turned many di&s;|$ffected
per&s;ons out of the commi&s;&s;ion of the peace, the
<PB N="346" REF="352">
Hou&s;e ordered a bill to be prepared for qualifying ju&s;tices
of the peace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1700.</NOTE> and appointed a committee to in&s;pect the
commi&s;&s;ions. This reporting, that many di&s;&s;enters and
men of &s;mall fortunes, depending on the court, were put
into tho&s;e places, the Commons declared, in an addre&s;s,
That it would much conduce to the &s;ervice of his Ma|je&s;ty,
and the good of this kingdom, that gentlemen of
quality and good e&s;tates &s;hould be re&s;tored, and put into
the commi&s;&s;ions of the peace and lieutenancy: and that
men of &s;mall e&s;tates be neither continued, nor put into
the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ions. The King a&s;&s;ured them he was
of the &s;ame opinion: and that he would give directions
accordingly. They were &s;o mollified by this in&s;tance of
his conde&s;cen&s;ion, that they thanked him in a body for
his gracious an&s;wer. They pa&s;&s;ed a bill to exculpate &s;uch
as had neglected to &s;ign the a&s;&s;ociation, either through
mi&s;take, or want of opportunity. Having received a
petition from the Lanca&s;hire clergy, complaining of the
in&s;olence and attempts of popi&s;h prie&s;ts, they appointed a
committee to enquire how far the laws again&s;t popi&s;h re|fugees
had been put in execution; and upon the report a
bill was brought in, complying with the prayer of the
petition. It decreed a further reward to &s;uch per&s;ons as
&s;hould di&s;cover and convict popi&s;h prie&s;ts and je&s;uits; and
perpetual impri&s;onment for tho&s;e convicted on the oath of
one or more witne&s;&s;es. It enacted, That no per&s;on born
after the twenty-fifth day of March next en&s;uing, being a
papi&s;t, &s;hould be capable of inheriting any title of ho|nour
or e&s;tate within the kingdom of England, dominion
of Wales, or town of Berwick upon Tweed; and, That
no papi&s;t &s;hould be capable of purcha&s;ing any lands, tene|ments,
or hereditaments, either in his own name, or in the
name of any other per&s;on in tru&s;t for him. Several alter|ations
were made in this fir&s;t draft, before it was fini&s;hed
and &s;ent up to the Lords, &s;ome of whom propo&s;ed amend|ments:
the&s;e, however, were not adopted; and the bil$
obtained the royal a&s;&s;ent, contrary to the expectation o$
tho&s;e who pro&s;ecuted the mea&s;ure, on the &s;uppo&s;ition tha$
<PB N="347" REF="353">
the King was a favourer of papi&s;ts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. 1700.</NOTE> After all, the bill
was deficient in nece&s;&s;ary clau&s;es to enforce execution;
&s;o that the law was very little regarded in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. The court &s;u&s;tained another in&s;ult from the
old Ea&s;t-India company, who petitioned the Hou&s;e that
they might be continued by parliamentary authority during
the remaining part of the time pre&s;cribed in their charter.
They, at the &s;ame time, publi&s;hed a &s;tate of their ca&s;e, in
which they expatiated upon the equity of their claims, and
magnified the injuries they had undergone. The new
company drew up an an&s;wer to this remon&s;trance, expo&s;ing
the corrupt practices of their adver&s;aries. But the in|fluence
of their great patron, Mr. Montagu, was now
vani&s;hed: the &s;upply was not yet di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and the mi|ni&s;try
would not venture to provoke the Commons, who
&s;eemed propitious to the old company, and actually pa&s;&s;ed
a bill in their favour. This, meeting with no oppo&s;ition
in the Upper Hou&s;e, was enacted into a law, renewing
their e&s;tabli&s;hment: &s;o that now there were two rival
companies of merchants trading to the Ea&s;t-Indies. The
Commons, not yet &s;atisfied with the vexations to which
they had expo&s;ed their &s;overeign, pa&s;&s;ed a bill to appoint
commi&s;&s;ioners for taking and examining the public ac|counts.
Another law was made, to prohibit the u&s;e of
India &s;ilks and &s;tuffs which interfered with the Engli&s;h
manufactures: a third, to take off the duties on the ex|portation
of woolen manufactures, corn, grain, meal,
bread, and bi&s;cuit: and a fourth, in which provi&s;ion was
made for puni&s;hing governors, or commanders in chief of
plantations and colonies, in ca&s;e they &s;hould commit any
crimes or acts of inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion in the exerci&s;e
of their admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. The people of Scotland &s;till continued in
violent agitation. They publi&s;hed a pamphlet, contain|ing
a detail of their grievances, which they in a great mea|&s;ure
a&s;cribed to his Maje&s;ty. A complaint being preferred
to the Hou&s;e of Commons again&s;t this performance, it
was voted a fal&s;e, &s;candalous, and traitorous libel, and
<PB N="348" REF="354">
ordered to be burned by the hands of the common hang|man.
The Commons addre&s;&s;ed his Maje&s;ty, to i&s;&s;ue his
royal proclamation for apprehending the author, printer,
and publi&s;her of the &s;aid libel; and he complied with
their reque&s;t. The Scotti&s;h company had &s;ent up an ad|dre&s;s
to the King, in behalf of &s;ome adventurers who were
wrongfully detained pri&s;oners in Carthagena: but Lord
Ba&s;il Hamilton, who undertook the charge of this petition,
was refu&s;ed admittance to his Maje&s;ty, on pretence of his
being &s;u&s;pected of di&s;affection to the government. The
King, however, wrote to his council for Scotland, that he
would demand the enlargement of the pri&s;oners, and coun|tenance
any laudable mea&s;ure that could advance the trade
of that kingdom. The directors of the company, not
content with this declaration, importuned their Lord Chan|cellor,
who was in London, to procure acce&s;s for Lord
Ba&s;il Hamilton; and the mini&s;try took &s;helter from their
&s;ollicitations behind a parliamentary enquiry. The &s;ub|ject
of the Scotti&s;h colony being introduced into the Hou&s;e
of Lords, where the mini&s;terial influence preponderated,
a vehement debate aro&s;e, not from any regard to the intere&s;t
of Scotland, but from mere oppo&s;ition to the court, which,
however, triumphed in the i&s;&s;ue. A motion was made,
that the &s;ettlement of the Scotch colony at Darien was
incon&s;i&s;tent with the good of the plantation-trade of Eng|land;
and pa&s;&s;ed in the affirmative by a &s;mall majority.
Then they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, declaring their &s;ympathy
with the lo&s;&s;es of their fellow-&s;ubjects, and their opinion,
that a pro&s;ecution of the de&s;ign mu&s;t end, not only in sfar
greater di&s;appointments to them&s;elves, but al&s;o prove very
inconvenient to the trade and quiet of the kingdom. They
reminded him of the addre&s;s of both Hou&s;es, touching that
&s;ettlement; and they expre&s;&s;ed their approbation of the
orders he had &s;ent to the governors of the plantations
on this &s;ubject. The King, in his an&s;wer to the addre&s;s,
in which the Commons refu&s;ed to concur, took the op|portunity
of exhorting them to con&s;ider of an union be|tween
the two kingdoms, as a mea&s;ure, than which nothing
<PB N="349" REF="355">
could more contribute to their mutual &s;ecurity and advan|tage.
The Lords, in pur&s;uance of this advice, prepared a bill,
appointing certain commi&s;&s;ioners of the realm of England
to treat with commi&s;&s;ioners of Scotland for the weal of
both kingdoms: but it was ob&s;tructed in the Hou&s;e of
Commons, who were determined to thwart every &s;tep that
might tend to le&s;&s;en the di&s;gu&s;t, or appea&s;e the animo&s;ity
of the Scotti&s;h nation. The malcontents in&s;inuated, that
the King's oppo&s;ition to the Scotti&s;h company flowed
neither from his regard to the intere&s;t of England, nor from
his punctual ob&s;ervance of treaties with Spain; but &s;olely
from his attachment to the Dutch, who maintained an
advantageous trade from the i&s;land of Cura&ccedil;oa to the Spa|ni&s;h
plantations in America, and were apprehen&s;ive that
the Scotti&s;h company would deprive them of this com|merce.
This interpretation &s;erved as fuel to the flame al|ready
kindled in Scotland, and indu&s;triou&s;ly blown up by
the calumnies of the Jacobites. Their parliament adopt|ed
the company as a national concern, by voting, That
the colony of Caledonia in Darien was a legal and rightful
&s;ettlement, which the parliament would maintain and &s;up|port.
On account of this re&s;olution the &s;e&s;&s;ion was for
&s;ome time di&s;continued: but, when the Scots under&s;tood
their new &s;ettlement was totally abandoned, their capital
lo&s;t, and all their hope entirely vani&s;hed, the whole nation
was &s;eized with a tran&s;port of fury. They loudly exclaimed
that they had been &s;acri&s;iced and ba&s;ely betrayed in that
quarter where they were intitled to protection. They con|certed
an addre&s;s to the King, couched in a very high
&s;train, repre&s;enting the nece&s;&s;ity of an immediate parlia|ment.
It was circulated about the kingdom for &s;ub&s;crip|tions,
&s;igned by a great number of tho&s;e who &s;at in parlia|ment,
and pre&s;ented to the King by Lord Ro&s;s, who with
&s;ome others was deputed for that purpo&s;e. The King told
them, they &s;hould know his intention in Scotland; and
in the mean time adjourned their parliament by procla|mation.
The people, exa&s;perated at this new provocation,
began to form the draft of a &s;econd national addre&s;s, to
<PB N="350" REF="356">
be &s;igned by the &s;hires and boroughs of the kingdom
but, before this could be fini&s;hed, the King wrote a letter
to the Duke of Queen&s;berry, and the privy-council of that
nation, which was publi&s;hed for the &s;atisfaction of the
people. He profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf grieved at the nation's lo&s;s$
and willing to grant what might be needful for the relie$
and ea&s;e of the kingdom. He a&s;&s;ured them, he had their
intere&s;t at heart; and that his good &s;ubjects &s;hould have
convincing proofs of his &s;incere inclination to advance the
wealth and pro&s;perity of that his ancient kingdom. He
&s;aid, he hoped this declaration would be &s;atisfactory to
all good men: that they would not &s;uffer them&s;elve$
to be mi&s;led; nor give advantage to enemies, and ill-de&s;igning
per&s;ons, ready to &s;eize every opportunity o$
embroiling the government. He gave them to under&s;tand
that his nece&s;&s;ary ab&s;ence had occa&s;ioned the late adjourn|ment;
but as &s;oon as God &s;hould bring him back, thei$
parliament &s;hould be a&s;&s;embled. Even this explanation, &s;e|conded
by all the credit and addre&s;s of his mini&s;ters$
failed in allaying the national ferment, which ro&s;e to the
very verge of rebellion.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. The King, who, from his fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion to
the throne, had veered occa&s;ionally from one party to
another, according to the circum&s;tances of his affairs
and the oppo&s;ition he encountered, was at this period $word$
incen&s;ed and embarra&s;&s;ed by the caprice and in&s;olence o$
the Commons, that he willingly lent an ear to the leader$
of the Tories, who undertook to manage the Parliamen$
according to his plea&s;ure, provided he would part wit$
&s;ome of his mini&s;ters, who were peculiarly odious to th$
Commons. The per&s;on again&s;t whom their anger was chie$$
directed, was the Lord Chancellor Somers the mo&s;t a$$tive
leader of the Whig-party. They demanded hjs di$$mi&s;&s;ion,
and the King exhorted him to re&s;ign his office$
but he refu&s;ing to take any &s;tep that might indicate a &s;e$
of his enemies, or a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, the King &s;e$
a peremptory order for the &s;eals by the Lord Jer&s;ey, $word$
whom Somers delivered them without he&s;itation. Th$
were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively offered to Lord-Chief-Ju&s;tice Holt, $word$
<PB N="351" REF="357">
Trevor, the attorney-general, who declined accepting &s;uch
a precarious office. Meanwhile, the King granted a tem|porary
commi&s;&s;ion to three judges to &s;it in the Court of
Chancery; and at length be&s;towed the &s;eals, with the
title of Lord Keeper, on Nathan Wright, one of the &s;er|jeants
at law, a man but indifferently qualified for the
office to which he was now preferred. Though William
&s;eemed altogether attached to the Tories, and inclined
to a new Parliament, no per&s;on appeared to take the lead
in the affairs of government; and, indeed for &s;ome time
the admini&s;tration &s;eemed to be under no particular di|rection.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI. During the tran&s;actions of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion,
the negociation for a &s;econd partition-treaty had been car|ried
on in London by the French mini&s;ter, Tallard, in
conjunction with the Earls of Portland and Jer&s;ey, and
was &s;oon brought to perfection. On the twenty-fir&s;t day
of February the treaty was &s;igned in London; and on
the twenty-fifth of the next month it was &s;ub&s;cribed at
the Hague by Briord, the French envoy, and the pleni|potentiaries
of the States-General. By this convention
the treaty of Ry&s;wick was confirmed. The contracting
parties agreed, that, in ca&s;e of his Catholick Maje&s;ty's
dying without i&s;&s;ue, the Dauphin &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s, for
him&s;elf and his heirs, the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily,
the i&s;lands of St. Stephano, Porto Hercole, Orbitello,
Telamone, Porto Longone, Piombino, the city and mar|qui&s;ate
of Final, the province of Guipu&s;coa, the duchies
of Lorraine and Bar, in exchange for which la&s;t, the Duke
of Lorraine &s;hould enjoy the duchy of Milan; but that
the county of Biche &s;hould remain in &s;overeignty to the
Prince of Vaudemont: that the Archduke Charles &s;hould
inherit the kingdom of Spain and all its dependencies in
and out of Europe; but, in ca&s;e of his dying without
i&s;&s;ue, it &s;hould devolve to &s;ome other child of the Emperor,
except him who might &s;ucceed as Emperor or King of
the Romans: that this monarchy &s;hould never de&s;cend to
a King of France or Dauphin; and that three months
<PB N="352" REF="358">
&s;hould be allowed to the Emperor, to con&s;ider whether or
not he would accede to this treaty. Whether the French
King was really &s;incere in his profe&s;&s;ions at this juncture,
or propo&s;ed this treaty with a view to make a clande&s;tine
u&s;e of it at the court of Spain for more intere&s;ted purpo|&s;es,
it is not ea&s;y to determine: at fir&s;t, however, it was
concealed from the notice of the publick, as if the parties
had re&s;olved to take no &s;tep in con&s;equence of it, during
the life of his Catholick Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. In the beginning of July the King embarked
for Holland, after having appointed a regency to govern
the kingdom in his ab&s;ence. On the twenty-ninth day of
the &s;ame month, the young Duke of Glouce&s;ter, the only
remaining child of &s;eventeen which the Prince&s;s Anne
had bor'n, died of a malignant fever, in the eleventh
year of his age. His death was much lamented by the
greater part of the Engli&s;h nation, not only on account of
his promi&s;ing talents and gentle behaviour, but al&s;o, as it
left the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion undetermined, and might create di&s;putes
of fatal con&s;equence to the nation. The Jacobites openly
exulted in an event which they imagined would remove
the chief bar to the intere&s;t of the Prince of Wales:
but the prote&s;tants generally turned their eyes upon the
Prince&s;s Sophia, Electre&s;s Dowager of Hanover, and
grand-daughter of James I. It was with a view to concert
the e&s;tabli&s;hment of her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that the court of
Brun&s;wick now returned the vi&s;it of King William.
The pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs in England, however, afforded
a very uncomfortable pro&s;pect. The people were gene|rally
alienated from the per&s;on and government of the
reigning king, upon whom they &s;eem to have &s;urfeited.
The vigour of their minds was de&s;troyed by luxury and
&s;loth: the &s;everity of their morals was relaxed by a long
habit of venality and corruption. The King's health
began to decline, and even his faculties decayed apace.
No per&s;on was appointed to a&s;cend the throne when it
&s;hould become vacant. The Jacobite faction alone was
eager, vigilant, enterpri&s;ing, and elate. They di&s;|patched
Mr. Graham, brother of Lord Pre&s;ton, to the
<PB N="353" REF="359">
court of St. Germain's, immediately after the death of the
Duke of Glouce&s;ter: they began to be&s;tir them&s;elves all
over the kingdom. A report was &s;pread that the Prince&s;s
Anne had privately &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to her father; and
Britain was once more threatened with civil war, con|fu&s;ion,
anarchy, and ruin.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. In the mean time, King William was not
inactive. The Kings of Denmark and Poland, with the
Elector of Brandenburgh, had formed a league to cru&s;h
the young King of Sweden, by invading his dominions on
different &s;ides. The Poles actually entered Livonia, and
undertook the &s;iege of Riga: the King of Denmark having
demoli&s;hed &s;ome forts in Hol&s;tein, the Duke of which was
connected with Sweden, inve&s;ted Tonninghen. The
Swedi&s;h mini&s;ter in England demanded that a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
William which had been &s;tipulated in a late renewal of
the ancient treaty between England and Sweden. The
States of Holland were &s;ollicited to the &s;ame purpo&s;e.
Accordingly, a fleet of thirty &s;ail, Engli&s;h and Dutch,
was &s;ent to the Baltick, under the command of Sir
George Rooke, who joined the Swedi&s;h &s;quadron, and
bombarded Copenhagen, to which the Dani&s;h fleet had
retired. At the &s;ame time, the Duke of Lunenbourg,
with the Swedi&s;h forces, which happened to be at Bre|men,
pa&s;&s;ed the Elbe, and marched to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
the Duke of Hol&s;tein. The Danes immediately aban|doned
the &s;iege of Tonninghen; and a body of Saxons,
who had made an irruption into the territories of the
Duke of Brun&s;wick, were obliged to retreat in di&s;order.
By the mediation of William, a negociation was begun
for a treaty between Sweden and Denmark, which, in
order to quicken, Charles the young King of Sweden
made a de&s;cent upon the i&s;le of Zealand. This was ex|ecuted
with great &s;ucce&s;s. Charles was the fir&s;t man
who landed; and here he exhibited &s;uch marks of cou|rage
and conduct, far above his years, as equally a&s;toni&s;h|ed
and intimidated his adver&s;aries. Then he determined
to be&s;iege Copenhagen; a re&s;olution that &s;truck &s;uch
<PB N="354" REF="360">
terrour into the Danes, that they proceeded with re|doubled
diligence in the treaty, which was brought to a
conclu&s;ion, between Denmark, Sweden, and Hol&s;tein,
about the middle of Augu&s;t. Then the Swedes retired
to Schonen, and the &s;quadrons of the maritime powers
returned from the Baltick.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIV. When the new partition treaty was com|municated
by the mini&s;ters of the $$$tracting parties to
the other powers of Europe, it generally met with a very
unfavourable con&s;truction. Saxony and the northern
crowns were &s;till embroiled with their own quarrels,
con&s;equently could not give much attention to &s;uch a
remote tran&s;action. The Princes of Germany appeared
cautious and dilatory in their an&s;wers, unwilling to be
concerned in any plan that might excite the re&s;entment
of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. The Elector of Brandenburgh,
in particular, had &s;et his heart upon the regal dignity,
which he hoped to obtain from the favour and authority
of the Emperor. The Italian &s;tates were aver&s;e to the
partition-treaty, from their apprehen&s;ion of &s;eeing France
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Naples, and other di&s;tricts of their country.
The Duke of Savoy affected a my&s;terious neutrality, in
hopes of being able to barter his con&s;ent for &s;ome con&s;ider|able
advantage. The Swi&s;s cantons declined acceding as
guarantees. The Emperor expre&s;&s;ed his a&s;toni&s;hment
that any di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould be made of the Spani&s;h mo|narchy
without the con&s;ent of the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and
the &s;tates of the kingdom. He ob&s;erved, that neither
ju&s;tice nor decorum could warrant the contracting powers
to compel him, who was the rightful heir, to accept a
part of his inheritance within three months, under pe|nalty
of forfeiting even that &s;hare to a third per&s;on not yet
named; and he declared, that he could take no final re|&s;olution,
until he &s;hould know the &s;entiments of his Ca|tholick
Maje&s;ty, on an affair in which their mutual intere&s;t
was &s;o nearly concerned. Leopold was actually engaged
in a negociation with the King of Spain, who &s;igned a
will in favour of his &s;econd &s;on Charles: yet he took no
<PB N="355" REF="361">
mea&s;ures to &s;upport the di&s;po&s;ition, either by &s;ending the
Archduke with a &s;ufficient force into Spain, or by de|taching
troops into Italy.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. The people of Spain were exa&s;perated at
the in&s;olence of the three foreign powers who pretended to
parcel out their dominions. Their pride took the alarm,
at the pro&s;pect of their monarchy's being di&s;membered;
and the grandees repined at the thought of lo&s;ing &s;o many
lucrative governments, which they now enjoyed. The
King's life became every day more and more precarious,
from frequent returns of his di&s;order. The mini&s;try was
weak and divided, the nobility factious, and the people
di&s;contented. The hearts of the nation had been alienated
from the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, by the in&s;olent carriage and
rapacious di&s;po&s;ition of the Queen Mariana. The French
had gained over to their intere&s;ts the Cardinal Portocarre|ro,
the Marquis de Monterey, with many other noblemen
and per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. The&s;e, perceiving the &s;enti|ments
of the people, employed their emi&s;&s;aries to rai&s;e a
general cry that France alone could maintain the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
entire: that the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria was feeble and ex|hau&s;ted,
and any prince of that line mu&s;t owe his chief
&s;upport to dete&s;table hereticks. Portocarrero tampered
with the weakne&s;s of his &s;overeign. He repeated and ex|aggerated
all the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions: he advi&s;ed him to con&s;ult
Pope Innocent XII. on this momentous point of regu|lating
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. That pontiff, who was a creature
of France, having taken the advice of a college of cardi|nals,
determined that the renunciation of Maria The|re&s;a
was invalid and null, as being founded upon com|pul&s;ion,
and contrary to the fundamental laws of the
Spani&s;h monarchy. He, therefore, exhorted King Charles
to contribute to the propagation of the faith, and the re|po&s;e
of Chri&s;tendom, by making a new will in favour of
a grand&s;on of the French monarch. This admonition
was &s;econded by the remon&s;trances of Portocarrero; and
the weak prince complied with the propo&s;al. In the mean
time, the King of France &s;eemed to act heartily, as a
<PB N="356" REF="362">
principal in the treaty of partition. His mini&s;ters at foreign
courts co-operated with tho&s;e of the maritime powers, in
&s;olliciting the acce&s;&s;ion of the different potentates in Eu|rope.
When Count Zinzendorf, the Imperial amba&s;&s;a|dor
at Paris, pre&s;ented a memorial, de&s;iring to know what
part France would act, &s;hould the King of Spain volun|tarily
place a grand&s;on of Louis upon the throne, the
Marquis de Torcy an&s;wered in writing, that his Mo&s;t
Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty would by no means li&s;ten to &s;uch a pro|po&s;al:
nay, when the Emperor's mini&s;ter gave them to
under&s;tand that his ma&s;ter was ready to begin a &s;eparate
negociation with the court of Ver&s;ailles, touching the
Spani&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, Louis declared he could not treat on
that &s;ubject without the concurrence of his allies.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. The nature of the partition-treaty was no
&s;ooner known in England, than condemned by the mo&s;t
intelligent part of the nation. They fir&s;t of all complained,
that &s;uch an important affair &s;hould be concluded without
the advice of parliament. They ob&s;erved, that the &s;cheme
was unju&s;t, and the execution of it hazardous: that, in
concerting the terms, the maritime powers &s;eemed to have
acted as parti&s;ans of France; for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Naples
and the Tu&s;can ports would &s;ubject Italy to her dominion,
and interfere with the Engli&s;h trade to the Levant and
Mediterranean; while Guipu&s;coa, on any future rupture,
would afford another inlet into the heart of the Spani&s;h
dominions: they, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, pronounced the
treaty de&s;tructive of the balance of power, and prejudicial
to the intere&s;t of England. All the&s;e arguments were
trumpeted by the malcontents, &s;o that the whole king|dom
echoed with the clamour of di&s;affection. Sir Chri&s;to|pher
Mu&s;grave, and others of the Tory faction, began to
think in earne&s;t of e&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Eng|li&s;h
crown upon the per&s;on of the Prince of Wales. They
are &s;aid to have &s;ent over Mr. Graham to St. Germain's
with overtures to this purpo&s;e, and an a&s;&s;urance that a
motion would be made in the Hou&s;e of Commons, to pa&s;s
a vote that the crown &s;hould not be &s;upported in the exe|cution
<PB N="357" REF="363">
of the partition-treaty. King William was not
ignorant of the cen&s;ure he had undergone, and not a little
alarmed to find him&s;elf &s;o unpopular among his own
&s;ubjects. That he might be the more able to be&s;tow his
attention effectually upon the affairs of England, he re|&s;olved
to take &s;ome mea&s;ures for the &s;atisfaction of the
Scotti&s;h nation. He permitted the parliament of that
kingdom to meet on the twenty-eighth day of October, and
wrote a letter to them from his hou&s;e at Loo, containing
an a&s;&s;urance that he would concur in every thing that
could be rea&s;onably propo&s;ed for maintaining and advanc|ing
the peace and welfare of their kingdom. He promi&s;ed
to give his royal a&s;&s;ent to &s;uch acts as they &s;hould frame for
the better e&s;tabli&s;hment of the pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline; for
preventing the growth of popery, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing vice and im|morality,
encouraging piety and virtue, pre&s;erving and
&s;ecuring per&s;onal liberty, regulating and advancing trade,
retrieving the lo&s;&s;es, and promoting the intere&s;t of their
African and Indian companies. He expre&s;&s;ed his concern
that he could not a&s;&s;ert the company's right of e&s;tabli&s;hing
a colony at Darien, without di&s;turbing the peace of
Chri&s;tendom, and entailing a ruinous war on that his an|cient
kingdom. He recommended unanimity and di&s;patch
in rai&s;ing competent taxes for their own defence; and told
them he had thought fit to continue the Duke of Queen&s;|berry
in the office of high-commi&s;&s;ioner. Notwith&s;tand|ing
this &s;oothing addre&s;s, the national re&s;entment conti|nued
to rage, and the parliament &s;eemed altogether in|tractable.
By this time the company had received certain
tidings of the entire &s;urrender of their &s;ettlement; and,
on the fir&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, they repre&s;ented to parlia|ment,
that for want of due protection abroad, &s;ome per&s;ons
had been encouraged to break in upon their privileges even
at home. This remon&s;trance was &s;ucceeded by another
national addre&s;s to the King, who told them he could not
take any further notice of that affair, &s;ince the parliament
was now a&s;&s;embled; and he had already made a declaration,
with which he hoped all his faithful &s;ubjects would be
<PB N="358" REF="364">
&s;atisfied. Neverthele&s;s, he found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary
to practi&s;e other expedients for allaying the ferment of
that nation. His mini&s;ters and their agents be&s;tirred
them&s;elves &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that the heats in parliament
were entirely cooled, and the outcry of the people &s;ub&s;ided
into unavailing murmurs. The parliament re&s;olved, That
in con&s;ideration of their great deliverance by his Maje&s;ty;
and, as next under God, their &s;afety and happine&s;s wholly
depended on his pre&s;ervation and that of his government,
they would &s;upport both to the utmo&s;t of their power, and
maintain &s;uch forces as &s;hould be requi&s;ite for tho&s;e ends.
They pa&s;&s;ed an act for keeping on foot three thou&s;and men
for two years, to be maintained by a land-tax. Then the
commi&s;&s;ioner produced the King's letter, de&s;iring to have
eleven hundred men on his own account to the fir&s;t day of
June following: they forthwith complied with his reque&s;t,
and were prorogued to the &s;ixth of May. The &s;upernu|merary
troops were &s;ent over to the States-General; and
the Earl of Argyle was honoured with the title of duke,
as a recompen&s;e for having concurred with the commi&s;|&s;ioner
in managing this &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. King William had returned to England
on the eighteenth day of October, not a little chagrined
at the perplexities in which he found him&s;elf involved;
and, in the beginning of the next month, he received
advice that the King of Spain was actually dead. He could
not be &s;urpri&s;ed at this event, which had been &s;o long ex|pected;
but it was attended with a circum&s;tance which he
had not fore&s;een. Charles, by his la&s;t will, had declared
the Duke of Anjou, &s;econd &s;on of the Dauphin, the &s;ole
heir of the Spani&s;h monarchy. In ca&s;e this prince &s;hould
die without i&s;&s;ue, or inherit the crown of France, he willed
that Spain &s;hould devolve to the Duke of Berry; in de|fault
of him, and children, to the Archduke Charles and
his heirs; failing of whom, to the Duke of Savoy and his
po&s;terity. He likewi&s;e recommended a match between the
Duke of Anjou, and one of the Archduche&s;&s;es. When
this te&s;tament was fir&s;t notified to the French court, Louis
<PB N="359" REF="365">
&s;eemed to he&s;itate between his inclination and engage|ments
to William and the Sates-General. Madame de
Maintenon is &s;aid to have joined her influence to that of
the Dauphin, in per&s;uading the King to accept of the
will; and Pontchartrain was engaged to &s;upport the &s;ame
mea&s;ure. A cabinet-council was called in her apartment.
The re&s;t of the mini&s;try declared for the treaty of parti|tion:
the King affected a kind of neutrality. The
Dauphin &s;poke for his &s;on, with an air of re&s;olution he
had never a&s;&s;umed before: Pontchartrain &s;econded his
arguments: Madame de Maintenon a&s;ked what the Duke
of Anjou had done to provoke the King, that he &s;hould
be barred of his right to that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion? Then the
re&s;t of the members e&s;pou&s;ed the Dauphin's opinion;
and the King owned him&s;elf convinced by their rea&s;ons.
In all probability, the deci&s;ion of this council was pre|viou&s;ly
&s;ettled in private. After the will was accepted,
Louis clo&s;etted the Duke of Anjou, to whom he &s;aid, in
pre&s;ence of the Marquis des Rios, &startq;Sir, the King of
Spain has made you a king. The grandees demand
you; the people wi&s;h for you, and I give my con&s;ent.
Remember only, you are a prince of France. I recom|mend
to you to love your people, to gain their affec|tion
by the lenity of your government, and to render
your&s;elf worthy of the throne you are going to a&s;cend.&endq;
The new monarch was congratulated on this elevation by
all the princes of the blood: neverthele&s;s, the Duke of
Orleans and his &s;on prote&s;ted again&s;t the will, becau&s;e the
Archduke was placed next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Duke of
Berry, in bar of their right as de&s;cendents of Anne of
Au&s;tria, who&s;e renunciation could be of no more force
than that of Maria-There&s;a. On the fourth day of De|cember,
the new king &s;et out for Spain, to the frontiers
of which he was accompanied by his two brothers.</P>
<P>XXXVIII. When the will was accepted, the French
mini&s;ter De Torcy endeavoured to ju&s;tify his ma&s;ter's
conduct to the Earl of Manche&s;ter, who re&s;ided at Paris
in the character of amba&s;&s;ador from the court of London.
<PB N="360" REF="366">
He ob&s;erved, That the treaty of partition was not likely
to an&s;wer the ends for which it had been concerted:
That the Emperor had refu&s;ed to accede: That it was
reli&s;hed by none of the princes to whom it had been com|municated:
That the people of England and Holland had
expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;content at the pro&s;pect of France's being
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Naples and Sicily: That if Louis had
rejected the will, the Archduke would have had a double
title derived from the former will, and that of the late
king: That the Spaniards were &s;o aver&s;e to the divi&s;ion of
their monarchy, there would be a nece&s;&s;ity for conquering
the whole kingdom before the treaty could be executed:
That the &s;hips to be furni&s;hed by Great Britain and Hol|land
would not be &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;es of &s;uch a
war; and it was doubtful whether England and the States-General
would engage them&s;elves in a greater expen&s;e.
He concluded with &s;aying, That the treaty would have
been more advantageous to France than the will, which
the King accepted purely from a de&s;ire of pre&s;erving the
peace of Europe. His ma&s;ter hoped, therefore, the good
under&s;tanding would &s;ub&s;i&s;t between him and the King of
Great-Britain. The &s;ame rea&s;ons were communicated by
Briod, the French amba&s;&s;ador at the Hague, to the States-General.
Notwith&s;tanding this addre&s;s, they ordered their
envoy at Paris to deliver a memorial to the French King,
expre&s;&s;ing their &s;urpri&s;e at his having accepted the will;
and their hope, that as the time &s;pecified for the Emperor's
acceding to the treaty was not expired, his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian
Maje&s;ty would take the affair again into his con&s;ideration,
and adhere to his engagements in every article. Louis, in
his an&s;wer to this memorial, which he di&s;patched to all the
courts of Europe, declared, That what he chiefly con&s;i|dered
was the principal de&s;ign of the contracting parties,
namely the maintenance of peace in Europe; and that,
true to this principle, he only departed from the words,
that he might the better adhere to the &s;pirit of the treaty.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. With this an&s;wer he &s;ent a letter to the
States, giving them to under&s;tand, that the peace of Eu|rope
<PB N="361" REF="367">
was &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed by the will of the King of
Spain, in favour of his grand&s;on, that he did not doubt
their approbation of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Spani&s;h crown.
The States ob&s;erved, That they could not declare them|&s;elves
upon an affair of &s;uch con&s;equence, without con|&s;ulting
their re&s;pective provinces. Louis admitted the
excu&s;e, and a&s;&s;ured them of his readine&s;s to concur with
whatever they &s;hould de&s;ire for the &s;ecurity of the Spani&s;h
Netherlands. The Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador of the Hague
pre&s;ented them with a letter from his new ma&s;ter, who
likewi&s;e notified his acce&s;&s;ion to all the powers of Europe,
except the King of England. The Emperor loudly ex|claimed
again&s;t the will, as being more iniquitous than
the treaty of partition; and threatened to do him&s;elf
ju&s;tice by force of arms. The Spaniards apprehending
that a league would be formed between his Imperial Ma|je&s;ty
and the maritime powers, for &s;etting a&s;ide the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of the Duke of Anjou; and, con&s;cious of their
own inability to defend their dominions, re&s;igned them|&s;elves
entirely to the protection of the French monarch.
The towns in the Spani&s;h Netherlands and the duchy of
Milan admitted French garri&s;ons: a French &s;quadron
anchored in the port of Cadiz; and another was detached
to the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements in the We&s;t-Indies. Part of
the Dutch army that was quartered in Luxembourg, Mons,
and Namur were made pri&s;oners of war, becau&s;e they
would not own the King of Spain, whom their ma&s;ters
had not yet acknowledged. The States were overwhelmed
with con&s;ternation by this event, e&s;pecially when they
con&s;idered their own naked &s;ituation, and reflected that
the Spani&s;h garri&s;ons might fall upon them before they
could a&s;&s;emble a body of troops for their defence. The
danger was &s;o imminent, that they re&s;olved to acknow|ledge
the King of Spain without further he&s;itation, and
wrote a letter to the French King for that purpo&s;e: this
was no &s;ooner received, than orders were i&s;&s;ued for &s;end|ing
back their battalions.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="368">
&sect; XL. How warmly &s;oever King William re&s;ented the
conduct of the French King, in accepting the will &s;o dia|metrically
oppo&s;ite to his engagements, he di&s;&s;embled his
chagrin, and behaved with &s;uch re&s;erve and apparent in|difference,
that &s;ome people naturally believed he had
been privy to the tran&s;action. Others imagined that he
was di&s;couraged from engaging in a new war by his
bodily infirmities, which daily increa&s;ed, as well as by the
oppo&s;ition in parliament, to which he &s;hould be inevitably
expo&s;ed. But his real aim was to conceal his &s;entiments,
until he &s;hould have &s;ounded the opinions of other powers
in Europe, and &s;een how far he could depend upon his
new mini&s;try. He now &s;eemed to repo&s;e his chief confi|dence
in the Earl of Roche&s;ter, who had undertaken for
the Tories, and was declared lord-lieutenant of Ireland.
Lord Godolphin was appointed fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the
Trea&s;ury: Lord Tankerville &s;ucceeded Lord Lon&s;dale,
lately decea&s;ed, as keeper of the privy-&s;eal, and Sir
Charles Hedges was declared &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in the
room of the Earl of Jer&s;ey: but the management of the
Commons was entru&s;ted to Mr. Robert Harley, who had
hitherto oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ures of the court with equal viru|lence
and ability. The&s;e new undertakers, well knowing
they &s;hould find it very difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to &s;e|cure
a majority in the pre&s;ent parliament, prevailed on
the King to di&s;&s;olve it by proclamation: then the &s;heriffs
were changed according to their nomination, and writs
i&s;&s;ued for a new parliament to meet on the &s;ixth day of
February. During this interval, Count Wrati&s;law ar|rived
in England, as amba&s;&s;ador from the Emperor, to
explain Leopold's title to the Spani&s;h monarchy, &s;up|ported
by repeated entails and renunciations, confirmed in
the mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties. This mini&s;ter met with a very
cold reception from tho&s;e who &s;tood at the helm of affairs.
They &s;ought to avoid all connexions that might engage
their country as a principal in another war upon the
continent, &s;marting as they were for the lo&s;&s;es and in|cumbrances
which the la&s;t had entailed upon them and
<PB N="363" REF="369">
their po&s;terity. They &s;eemed to think that Louis, rather
than involve him&s;elf in fre&s;h troubles, would give all the
&s;ecurity that could be de&s;ired for maintaining the peace of
Europe; or even, &s;hould this be refu&s;ed, they &s;aw no rea&s;on
for Britain's exhau&s;ting her wealth and &s;trength to &s;upport
a chimerical balance, in which her intere&s;t was but re|motely
concerned. It was their opinion, that by keeping
aloof, &s;he might render her&s;elf more re&s;pectable. Her
re&s;erve would over-awe contending powers: they would in
their turn &s;ue for her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and implore her good offices;
and, in&s;tead of declaring her&s;elf a party, &s;he would have
the honour to decide as arbitre&s;s of their di&s;putes. Perhaps
they extended this idea too far; and, in all probability,
their notions were enflamed by a &s;pirit of faction. They
hated the Whigs as their political adver&s;aries, and dete&s;ted
the war, becau&s;e it had been countenanced and &s;upported
by the intere&s;t of that party. The King believed, that a
conjunction of the two monarchies of France and Spain
would prove fatal to the liberties of Europe; and that this
could not be prevented by any other method than a general
union of the other European powers. He certainly was an
enthu&s;ia&s;t in his &s;entiments of this equilibrium; and fully
convinced that he him&s;elf, of all the potentates in Chri&s;ten|dom,
was the only prince capable of adju&s;ting the balance.
The Imperial amba&s;&s;ador could not, therefore, be long
ignorant of his real purpo&s;e, as he conver&s;ed with the
Dutch favourites, who knew and approved of their ma&s;ter's
de&s;ign, though he avoided a declaration, until he &s;hould
have rendered his mini&s;ters more propitious to his aim.
The true &s;ecret, however, of that re&s;erve with which
Count Wrati&s;law was treated at his fir&s;t arrival, was a pri|vate
negociation which the King had &s;et on foot with the
regency of Spain, touching a barrier in the Netherlands.
He propo&s;ed, that certain towns &s;hould be garri&s;oned with
Engli&s;h and Dutch troops, by way of &s;ecurity again&s;t the
ambitious de&s;igns of France: but the regency were &s;o de|voted
to the French intere&s;t, that they refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to
any propo&s;al of this nature. While this affair was in
<PB N="364" REF="370">
agitation, William re&s;olved to maintain a wary di&s;tan$
from the Emperor; but, when his effort mi&s;carried
the amba&s;&s;ador found him much more open and a$$ce&s;&s;ible<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This year was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a glorious victory which the young King of Sweden obtained in the nineteenth year of his age. Riga continued inve&s;ted by the King of Poland, while Peter the Czar of Mu&s;covy made his approaches to Narva, at the head of a prodigious army, purpo&s;ing, in violation of all $aith and ju&s;tice, to &s;hare the &s;poils of the youthful monarch. Charles landed at Revel, compelled the Saxons to abandon the &s;iege of Rig$$, and having &s;up|plied the place, marched with a $andful of troops again&s;t the Mu&s;covites, who had undertaken the &s;iege of Narva. The Czar quitted his army with $$me precipitation, as if he had been afraid of hazarding his per&s;on, while $word$ advanced through ways that were thought impracticable, and &s;urpri&s;ed the enemy. He broke into their camp before they had the lea&s;t intimation of his approach, and totally routed them, after a &s;hort re&s;i&s;tance. He took a great number of pri&s;oners, with all their baggage, tents, and artillery, and entered Narva in triumph.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. The parliament meeting on the &s;ixth, wa$
prorogued to the tenth day of February, when Mr. Harle$
was cho&s;en Speaker by a great majority, in oppo&s;ition $word$
Sir Richard On&s;low. The King had previou&s;ly told Si$
Thomas Lyttelton, it would be for his &s;ervice that h$
&s;hould yield his preten&s;ions to Harley at this juncture; an$
that gentleman agreed to ab&s;ent him&s;elf from the Hou&s;e o$
the day of election. The King ob&s;erved, in his &s;peech
That the nation's lo&s;s in the death of the Duke of Glou$ce&s;ter
had rendered it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for them t$
make further provi&s;ion for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown i$
the prote&s;tant line: That the death of the King of Spai$
had made &s;uch an alteration in the affairs of the continent$
as required their mature deliberation. The re&s;t of hi$
harangue turned upon the u&s;ual topicks of demanding &s;up$plies
for the en&s;uing year, reminding them of the defici|encies
and publick debts, recommending to their enquiry
the &s;tate of the navy and fortifications; exhorting them
to encourage commerce, employ the poor, and proceed
with vigour and unanimity in all their deliberations.
Though the elections had been generally carried in favour
of the Tory intere&s;t, the mini&s;try had &s;ecured but one part
of that faction. Some of the mo&s;t popular leaders, &s;uch
<PB N="365" REF="371">
as the Duke of Leeds, the Marquis of Normanby, the
Earl of Nottingham, Seymour, Mu&s;grave, How, Finch,
and Showers, had been either neglected or found refrac|tory,
and re&s;olved to oppo&s;e the court-mea&s;ures with all
their influence. Be&s;ides, the French King, knowing that
the peace of Europe would in a great mea&s;ure depend on
the re&s;olutions of the Engli&s;h parliament, is &s;aid to have
di&s;tributed great &s;ums of money in England, by means of
his mini&s;ter, Tallard, in order to &s;trengthen the oppo&s;ition
in the Hou&s;e of Commons. Certain it is, the nation
abounded, at this period, with the French coins called
Louis d'or and pi&s;toles; but whether this redundancy was
owing to a balance of trade in favour of England, or to
the large&s;&s;es of Louis, we &s;hall not pretend to determine.
We may likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, that the infamous practice of
bribing electors had never been &s;o flagrant as in the choice
of repre&s;entatives for this parliament. This &s;candalous traf|fick
had been chiefly carried on by the Whig party, and,
therefore, their antagoni&s;ts re&s;olved to &s;pare no pains in
detecting their corruption. Sir Edward Seymour di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
him&s;elf by his zeal and activity: he brought &s;ome
of the&s;e practices to light, and, in particular, &s;tigmatized
the new Ea&s;t-India company, for having been deeply con|cerned
in this &s;pecies of venality. An enquiry being &s;et
on foot in the Hou&s;e of Commons, &s;everal elections were
declared void; and, divers per&s;ons who had been illegally
returned, were fir&s;t expelled the Hou&s;e, and afterwards
detained in pri&s;on. Yet the&s;e pro&s;ecutions were carried
on with &s;uch partiality, as plainly indicated that they
flowed rather from party zeal than from patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. A great body of the Commons had re&s;olved
to pre&s;ent an addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, de&s;iring he would
acknowledge the King of Spain; and the motion, in all
probability, would have been carried by a con&s;iderable
majority, had not one bold and lucky expre&s;&s;ion given
&s;uch a turn to the debate, as induced the anti-courtiers to
de&s;i&s;t. One Mr. Moncton, in the heat of his declama|tion
again&s;t this mea&s;ure, &s;aid, he expected the next vote
<PB N="366" REF="372">
would be for owning the pretended Prince of Wales&punc;
Though there was little or no connexion between the&s;e
two &s;ubjects, a great many members were &s;tartled at the
in&s;inuation, and de&s;erted the mea&s;ure, which was dropped
accordingly. The King's &s;peech being taken into con|&s;ideration,
the Hou&s;e re&s;olved to &s;upport his Maje&s;ty and
his government; to take &s;uch effectual mea&s;ures as might
be&s;t conduce to the intere&s;t and &s;afety of England, and
the pre&s;ervation of the prote&s;tant religion. This re&s;olu|tion
was pre&s;ented in an addre&s;s to the King, who re|ceived
it favourably. At the &s;ame time, he laid before
them a memorial he had received from the States-General,
and de&s;ired their advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the points that
con&s;tituted the &s;ub&s;tance of this remon&s;trance. The
States gave him to under&s;tand, that they had acknow|ledged
the Duke of Anjou as King of Spain: that France
had agreed to a negociation, in which they might &s;tipu|late
the nece&s;&s;ary conditions for &s;ecuring the peace of Eu|rope;
and, that they were firmly re&s;olved to do nothing
without the concurrence of his Maje&s;ty and their other
allies. They, therefore, begged he would &s;end a mini&s;ter
to the Hague, with nece&s;&s;ary powers and in&s;tructions to
co-operate with them in this negociation: he told them
that, in ca&s;e it &s;hould prove ineffectual, or Holland be
&s;uddenly invaded by the troops which Louis had ordered
to advance towards their frontiers, they relied on the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of England, and hoped his Maje&s;ty would prepare
the &s;uccours &s;tipulated by treaty to be u&s;ed, &s;hould occa|&s;ion
require. The memorial was likewi&s;e communicated
to the Hou&s;e of Lords. Mean while, the Commons de|&s;ired
that the treaties between England and the States-General
&s;hould be laid before their Hou&s;e. The&s;e being
peru&s;ed, they re&s;olved upon an addre&s;s, to de&s;ire his Ma|je&s;ty
would enter into &s;uch negociations with the States-General,
and other potentates, as might mo&s;t effectually
conduce to the mutual &s;afety of Great-Britain and the
United-Provinces, as well as to the pre&s;ervation of the
peace of Europe and to a&s;&s;ure him of their &s;upport and
<PB N="367" REF="373">
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in performance of the treaty &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between
England and the States-General. This re&s;olution, how|ever,
was not carried without great oppo&s;ition from tho&s;e
who were aver&s;e to the nation's involving it&s;elf in another
war upon the continent. The King profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf ex|$remely
well plea&s;ed with this addre&s;s, and told them he
would immediately order his mini&s;ters abroad to act in
concert with the States-General and other powers, for
the attainment of tho&s;e ends they propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. He communicated to the Commons a letter
written by the Earl of Melfort to his brother the Earl of
Perth, governor to the pretended Prince of Wales. It had
been mi&s;laid by accident, and came to London in the
French mail. It contained a &s;cheme for another inva&s;ion
of England, together with &s;ome reflections on the cha|racter
of the Earl of Middleton, who had &s;upplanted him
at the Court of St. Germain's. Melfort was a mere pro|$ector,
and &s;eems to have had no other view than that of
recommending him&s;elf to King James, and bringing his
rival into di&s;grace. The Hou&s;e of Lords, to whom the
letter was al&s;o imparted, ordered it to be printed. Next
day they pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, thanking his Maje&s;ty for
his care of the prote&s;tant religion; de&s;iring all the treaties
made &s;ince the la&s;t war might be laid before them; re|que&s;ting
him to engage in &s;uch alliances as he &s;hould think
proper, for pre&s;erving the balance of power in Europe:
a&s;&s;uring him of their concurrence; expre&s;&s;ing their ac|knowledgement
for his having communicated Melfort's
letter; de&s;iring he would give orders for &s;ei&s;ing the hor&s;es
and arms of di&s;affected per&s;ons; for removing papi&s;ts from
London; and for &s;earching after tho&s;e arms and provi&s;ions
of war mentioned in the letter: finally, they reque&s;ted him
to equip &s;peedily a &s;ufficient fleet for the defence of him|&s;elf
and his kingdom. They received a gracious an&s;wer to
this addre&s;s, which was a further encouragement to the
King to put his own private de&s;igns in execution: towards
the &s;ame end the letter contributed not a little, by inflam|ing
the fears and re&s;entment of the nation again&s;t France,
<PB N="368" REF="374">
which in vain di&s;claimed the Earl of Melfort as a fanta&s;ti$cal
&s;chemer, to whom no regard was paid at the court $word$
Ver&s;ailles. The French mini&s;try complained of the publi$cation
of this letter, as an attempt to &s;ow jealou&s;y betwee$
the two crowns; and, as a convincing proof of their &s;in$cerity,
bani&s;hed the Earl of Mel&s;ort to Angers.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIV. The credit of Exchequer bills was &s;o lowere$
by the change of the mini&s;try, and the lap&s;e of the tim$
allotted for their circulation, that they fell near twenty
per cent. to the prejudice of the revenue, and the di&s;cre$dit
of the government in foreign countries. The Common
having taken this affair into con&s;ideration, voted, Tha$
provi&s;ion &s;hould be made from time to time for making
good the principal and intere&s;t due on all parliamentary
funds; and afterwards pa&s;&s;ed a bill for renewing the bill$
of credit, commonly called Exchequer bills. This was &s;en$
up to the Lords on the &s;ixth day of March, and on th$
thirteenth received the royal a&s;&s;ent. The next object tha$
engro&s;&s;ed the attention of the Commons was the &s;ettlemen$
of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne, which the King had re|commended
to their con&s;ideration in the beginning of the
&s;e&s;&s;ion. Having deliberated on this &s;ubject, they re&s;olved&punc;
That for the pre&s;ervation of the peace and happine&s;s of
the kingdom, and the &s;ecurity of the prote&s;tant religion&punc;
it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that a further declaration &s;hould
be made of the limitation and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown in
the prote&s;tant line, a$ter his Maje&s;ty and the Prince&s;s, and
the heirs of their bodies re&s;pectively: and, That further
provi&s;ion &s;hould be fir&s;t made for the &s;ecurity of the rights
and liberties of the people. Mr. Harley moved, That
&s;ome conditions of government might be &s;ettled as preli|minaries,
before they &s;hould proceed to the nomination of
the per&s;on, that their &s;ecurity might be complete. Accord|ingly,
they deliberated on this &s;ubject, and agreed to the
following re&s;olutions: That whoever &s;hall hereafter com$
to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this crown, &s;hall join in communion
with the church of England as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed: That$
in ca&s;e the crown and imperial dignity of this realm &s;hal$
<PB N="369" REF="375">
hereafter come to any per&s;on, not being a native of this
kingdom of England, this nation be not obliged to engage
in any war for the defence of any dominions or territories
which do not belong to the crown of England, without the
con&s;ent of parliament: That no per&s;on who &s;hall here|after
come to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown &s;hall go out of
the dominions of England, Scotland, or Ireland, without
con&s;ent of parliament: That, from and after the time
that the further limitation by this act &s;hall take effect, all
matters and things relating to the well governing of this
kingdom, which are properly cognizable in the privy-coun|cil,
by the laws and cu&s;toms of the realm, &s;hall be tran&s;|acted
there, and all re&s;olutions taken thereupon &s;hall be
&s;igned by &s;uch of the privy-council as &s;hall advi&s;e and con|&s;ent
to the &s;ame: That after the limitation &s;hall take effect,
no per&s;on born out of the kingdom of England, Scotland,
or Ireland, or the dominions thereunto belonging, altho'
he be naturalized, and made a denizen (except &s;uch as are
born of Engli&s;h parents) &s;hall be capable to be of the privy|council,
or a member of either Hou&s;e of parliament, or to
enjoy any office or place of tru&s;t, either civil or military,
or to have any grant of lands, tenements, or hereditaments
from the crown to him&s;elf, or to any others in tru&s;t for
him: That no per&s;on who has an office or place of profit
under the King, or receives a pen&s;ion from the crown, &s;hall
be capable of &s;erving as member of the Hou&s;e of Commons:
That after the limitation &s;hall take effect, judges com|mi&s;&s;ions
be made <HI>quamdiu &s;e bene ge&s;&s;erint,</HI> and their &s;ala|ries
a&s;certained and e&s;tabli&s;hed; but, upon the addre&s;s of
both Hou&s;es of Parliament, it may be lawful to remove
them: That no pardon under the great &s;eal of England be
pleadable to animpeachment by the Commons in parliament.
Having &s;ettled the&s;e preliminaries, they re&s;olved, That the
Prince&s;s Sophia, Duche&s;s Dowager of Hanover, be declared
the next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of England, in the pro|te&s;tant
line, after his Maje&s;ty, and the Prince&s;s, and the heirs
of their bodies re&s;pectively: and, That the further limitation
of the crown be to the &s;aid Prince&s;s Sophia and the heirs of her
<PB N="370" REF="376">
body, being prote&s;tants. A blll being formed on the&s;e
re&s;olutions, was &s;ent up to the Hou&s;e of Lords, where it
met with &s;ome oppo&s;ition from the Marquis of Normanby:
a prote&s;t was likewi&s;e entered again&s;t it by the Earls of
Huntingdon and Plymouth, and the Lords Guildford and
Jeffries. Neverthele&s;s, it pa&s;&s;ed without amendments,
and on the twelfth day of June received the royal a&s;&s;ent:
the King was extremely mortified at the preliminary limi|tations,
which he con&s;idered as an open in&s;ult on his own
conduct and admini&s;tration: not but that they were ne|ce&s;&s;ary
precautions, naturally &s;ugge&s;ted by the experience
of tho&s;e evils to which the nation had been already expo&s;ed,
in con&s;equence of rai&s;ing a foreign prince to the throne of
England. As the Tories lay under the imputation of favour|ing
the late King's intere&s;t, they exerted them&s;elves zea|lou&s;ly
on this occa&s;ion, to wipe off the a&s;per&s;ion, and in|finuate
them&s;elves into the confidence of the people;
hoping, that in the &s;equel they &s;hould be able to re&s;train
the nation from engaging too deep in the affairs of the con|tinent,
without incurring the charge of di&s;affection to the
pre&s;ent King and government. The act of &s;ettlement being
pa&s;&s;ed, the Earl of Macclesfield was &s;ent to notify the
tran&s;action to the Electre&s;s Sophia, who likewi&s;e received
from his hands the order of the garter.</P>
<P>&sect; XLV. The act of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion gave umbrage to all the
popi&s;h princes who were more nearly related to the crown
than his lady, whom the parliament had preferred to all
others. The Duche&s;s of Savoy, grand-daughter to King
Charles I. by her mother, ordered her amba&s;&s;ador, Count
Maffei, to make a prote&s;tation to the parliament of Eng|land,
in her name, again&s;t all re&s;olutions and deci&s;ions
contrary to her title, as &s;ole daughter to the Prince&s;s
Henrietta, next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of England,
after King William and the Prince&s;s Anne of Denmark.
Two copies of this prote&s;t Ma&s;&s;ei &s;ent in letters to the
Lord Keeper and the Speaker of the Lower Hou&s;e, by two
of his gentlemen, and a public notary to atte&s;t the delive|ry:
but no notice was taken of the declaration. The Duke
<PB N="371" REF="377">
of Savoy, while his mini&s;ter was thus employed in England,
engaged in an alliance with the crowns of France and Spain,
on condition, That his Catholic Maje&s;ty &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e
his younge&s;t daughter without a dowry: That he him&s;elf
&s;hould command the allied army in Italy, and furni&s;h eight
thou&s;and infantry, wi$h five and twenty hundred hor&s;e, in
con&s;ideration of a monthly &s;ub&s;idy of fifty thou&s;and crowns.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVI. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, Mr. Stanhope, en|voy
extraordinary to the States-General, was empowered
to treat with the mini&s;ters of France and Spain, according
to the addre&s;&s;es of both Hou&s;es of parliament. He repre|&s;ented,
that though his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty had
thought fit to deviate from the partition-treaty, it was not
rea&s;onable that the King of England &s;hould lo&s;e the effect
of that convention: he, therefore, expected &s;ome &s;ecurity
for the peace of Europe; and for that purpo&s;e in&s;i&s;ted
upon certain articles, importing, That the French King
&s;hould immediately withdraw his troops from the Spani&s;h
Netherlands: That for the &s;ecurity of England, the ci|ties
of O&s;tend and Nieuport &s;hould be delivered into the
hands of his Britannick Maje&s;ty: That no kingdom,
provinces, cities, lands, or places, belonging to the crown of
Spain, &s;hould ever be yielded or transferred to the crown of
France, on any pretence whatever: That the &s;ubjects of his
Britannick Maje&s;ty &s;hould retain all the privileges, rights, and
immunities, with regard to their navigation and commerce
in the dominions of Spain, which they enjoyed at the death
of his late Catholick Maje&s;ty; and al&s;o all &s;uch immunities,
rights, and franchi&s;es, as the &s;ubjects of France, or any
other power, either po&s;&s;e&s;s for the pre&s;ent, or may enjoy
for the future: That all treaties of peace and conventions
between England and Spain, &s;hould be renewed: and
That a treaty formed on the&s;e demands &s;hould be guaran|tied
by &s;uch powers as one or other of the contractors &s;hould
&s;olicit and prevail upon to accede. Such likewi&s;e were
the propo&s;als made by the States-General, with this differ|ence,
that they demanded, as cautionary towns, all the
&s;tronge&s;t places in the Netherlands. Count D'Avaux, the
<PB N="372" REF="378">
French mini&s;ter was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed at the&s;e exorbitant de|mands,
that he could not help &s;aying, They could not
have been higher, if his ma&s;ter had lo&s;t four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
battles. He a&s;&s;ured them, that his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty
would withdraw his troops from the Spani&s;h Netherlands
as &s;oon as the King of Spain &s;hould have forces of his
own &s;ufficient to guard the country: with re&s;pect to the
other articles, he could give no other an&s;wer, but that
he would immediately tran&s;mit them to Ver&s;ailles. Louis
was filled with indignation at the in&s;olent &s;train of tho&s;e
propo&s;als, which he con&s;idered as a &s;ure mark of Willi|am's
ho&s;tile intentions. He refu&s;ed to give any other &s;ecu|rity
for the peace of Europe, than a renewal of the treaty
of Ry&s;wick; and he is &s;aid to have tampered, by means
of his agents and emi&s;&s;aries, with the members of the
Engli&s;h parliament, that they might oppo&s;e all &s;teps
tending to a new war on the continent.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVII. King William certainly had no expectation
that France would clo&s;e with &s;uch propo&s;als; but he was
not without hope, that her refu&s;al would warm the Engli&s;h
nation into a concurrence with his de&s;igns. He commu|nicated
to the Hou&s;e of Commons the demands which had
been made by him and the States-General; and gave them
to under&s;tand, that he would from time to time make them
acquainted with the progre&s;s of the negociation. The
Commons, &s;u&s;pecting that his intention was to make
them parties in a congre&s;s which he might conduct to a
different end from that which they propo&s;ed, re&s;olved to
&s;ignify their &s;entiments in the an&s;wer to this me&s;&s;age.
They called for the treaty of partition, which being read,
they voted an addre&s;s of thanks to his Maje&s;ty, for his mo&s;t
gracious declaration, that he would make them acquainted
with the progre&s;s of the negociation: but they &s;ignified
their di&s;approbation of the partition-treaty, &s;igned with the
great &s;eal of England, without the advice of the parlia|ment
which was then &s;itting, and productive of ill con|&s;equences
to the kingdom, as well as to the peace of Eu|rope,
as it a&s;&s;igned over to the French King &s;uch a large
<PB N="373" REF="379">
portion of the Spani&s;h dominions. Nothing could be more
mortifying to the King, than this open attack upon his
own conduct: yet he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his re&s;entment, and with|out
taking the lea&s;t notice of their &s;entiments with re&s;pect
to the partition-treaty, a&s;&s;ured them, that he &s;hould be
always ready to receive their advice on the negociation
which he had &s;et on foot, according to their de&s;ire. The
debates in the Hou&s;e of Commons upon the &s;ubject of the
partition treaty ro&s;e to &s;uch violence, that divers members
in declaring again&s;t it, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the bounds of decency.
Sir Edward Seymour compared the divi&s;ion which had
been made of the Spani&s;h territories to a robbery on the
highway; and Mr. Howe did not &s;cruple to &s;ay it was a
felonious treaty: an expre&s;&s;ion, which the King re&s;ented
to &s;uch a degree, that he declared he would have demanded
per&s;onal &s;atisfaction with his &s;word, had not he been re|&s;trained
by the di&s;parity of condition between him&s;elf and
the per&s;on who had offered &s;uch anoutrageous in&s;ult to his
honour: Whether the tories intended to alienate the
minds of the nation from all foreign connexions, or to
wreak their vengeance on the late mini&s;ters, whom they
hated as the chiefs of the Whig-party, certain it is, they
now rai&s;ed an univer&s;al outcry again&s;t the partition-treaty,
which was not only condemned in publick-pamphlets and
private conver&s;ation, but even brought into the Hou&s;e of
Lords as an object of parliamentary cen&s;ure. In the month
of March a warm debate on this &s;ubject was begun by
She$field Marquis of Normanby, and carried on with great
vehemence by other noblemen of the &s;ame &s;action. They
exclaimed again&s;t the article by which &s;o many territories
were added to the crown of France: they complained,
that the Emperor had been for&s;aken: that the treaty was
not communicated to the privy-council or mini&s;try, but
clande&s;tinely tran&s;acted by the Earls of Portland and Jer|&s;ey:
that the &s;anction of the great &s;eal had been unju&s;tly
and irregularly applied, &s;ir&s;t to blank powers, and after|wards
to the treaty it&s;elf. The courtiers replied, that the
King had engaged in a treaty of partition at the de&s;ire of
<PB N="374" REF="380">
the Emperor, who had agreed to every article, except that
relating to the duchy of Milan, and afterwards de&s;ired,
that his Maje&s;ty would procure &s;or him the be&s;t terms he
could obtain; above all things recommending &s;ecre&s;y, that
he might not forfeit his intere&s;t in Spain, by &s;eeming to
con&s;ent to the treaty: that foreign negociations being en|tru&s;ted
to the care of the crown, the King lay under no
legal obligation to communicate &s;uch &s;ecrets of &s;tate to his
council; far le&s;s was he obliged to follow their advice:
and that the keeper of the great &s;eal had no authority for
refu&s;ing to apply it to any powers or treaty which the King
&s;hould grant or conclude, unle&s;s they were contrary to
law, which had made no provi&s;ion for &s;uch an emergency<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In the cour&s;e of this debate, the Earl of Roche&s;ter reprehended &s;ome lords for &s;peaking di&s;re&s;pectfully of the French King, ob&s;erving, that it was peculiarly incu$$$ent on peers to treat monarchs with decorum and re&s;pect, as they derived their dignity from the crown. Another affirming, that the French King was not only to be re&s;pected, but likewi&s;e to be feared; a certain lord replied, &startq;He hoped no man in England needed to be afraid of the French King, much le&s;s the Peer who &s;poke la&s;t, who was too much a friend to that monarch to fear any thing from his re$entment.&endq;</NOTE>.
The Earl of Portland, apprehending that this tempe&s;t
would bur&s;t upon his head, declared, on the &s;econd day
of the debate, that he had by the King's order communi|cated
the treaty, before it was concluded, to the Earls of
Pembroke and Marlborough, the Lords Lon&s;dale, Somers,
Hallifax and &s;ecretary Vernon. The&s;e noblemen owned,
that they had been made acquainted with the &s;ub&s;tance of
it: that when they excepted to &s;ome particulars, they
were told, his Maje&s;ty had carried the matter as far as it
could be advanced, and that he could obtain no better
terms: thus a&s;&s;ured that every article was already &s;ettled,
they &s;aid they no longer in&s;i&s;ted upon particulars, but gave
their advice that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould not engage him&s;elf in
any mea&s;ure that would produce a new war, &s;eeing the na|tion
had been &s;ounea&s;y under the la&s;t. After long debates,
and great variety as well as virulence of altercation, the
Hou&s;e agreed to an addre&s;s, in which they di&s;approved of
the partition-treaty, as a &s;cheme incon&s;i&s;tent with the
<PB N="375" REF="381">
peace and &s;afety of Europe, as well as prejudicial to the
intere&s;t of Great-Britain. They complained, that neither
the in&s;tructions given to his plenipotentiaries, nor the
draft of the treaty it&s;elf, had been laid before his Maje&s;ty's
council. They humbly be&s;ought him, that for the future,
he would in all matters of importance, require and admit
the advice of his natural-born &s;ubjects of known probity
and fortune; and that he would con&s;titute a council of
&s;uch per&s;ons, to whom he might impart all affairs which
&s;hould any way concern him and his dominions. They
ob&s;erved, that intere&s;t and natural affection to their coun|try
would incline them to every mea&s;ure that might tend
to its welfare and pro&s;perity; whereas &s;trangers could not
be &s;o much influenced by the&s;e con&s;iderations:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Oldmixon. Cole. Lamberty. State Tracts Tindal. Ra$ph. Voltair$.</NOTE> that their
knowledge of the country would render them more capable
than foreigners could be of advi&s;ing his Maje&s;ty touching
the true intere&s;ts of his kingdom: that they had exhibited
&s;uch repeated demon&s;trations of their duty and affection,
as mu&s;t convince his Maje&s;ty of their zeal in his &s;ervice;
nor could he want the knowledge of per&s;ons fit to be em|ployed
in all his &s;ecret and arduous affairs: finally, as the
French King appeared to have violated the treaty of par|tition,
they advi&s;ed his Maje&s;ty, in future negociations
with that prince, to proceed with &s;uch caution as might
imply a real &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>&sect; XLVIII. The King received this &s;evere remon&s;trance
with his u&s;ual phlegm, &s;aying, it contained matter of very
great moment; and he would take care that all treaties
he made &s;hould be for the honour and &s;afety of England.
Though he deeply felt this affront, he would not alter his
conduct towards the new mini&s;ters: but, he plainly per|ceived
their intention was to thwart him in his favourite
mea&s;ure, and humble him into a dependence upon their
intere&s;t in parliament. On the la&s;t day of March, he im|parted
to the Commons the French King's declaration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1701</NOTE>
that he would grant no other &s;ecurity than a renewal of
the treaty of Ry&s;wick: &s;o that the negociation &s;eemed to
be at an end. He likewi&s;e communicated two re&s;olutions
<PB N="376" REF="382">
of the States-General,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1701.</NOTE> with a memorial from their envoy
in England, relating to the &s;hips they had equipped with
a view to join the Engli&s;h fleet, and the &s;uccours &s;tipulated
in the treaty concluded in the year 1677, which they de|&s;ired
might be &s;ent over with all convenient expedition.
The Hou&s;e having con&s;idered this me&s;&s;age, unanimou&s;ly
re&s;olved to de&s;ire his Maje&s;ty would carry on the negocia|tions
in concert with the States-General, and take &s;uch
mea&s;ures therein as might mo&s;t conduce to their &s;afety: they
a&s;&s;ured him, they would effectually enable him to &s;upport
the treaty of 1677, by which England was bound to a&s;&s;i&s;t
them with ten thou&s;and men, and twenty &s;hips of war, in
ca&s;e they &s;hould be attacked. Though the King was
nettled at that part of this addre&s;s, which, by confining
him to one treaty, implied their di&s;approbation of a new
confederacy, he di&s;covered no &s;igns of emotion; but
thanked them for the a&s;&s;urance they had given, and told
them he had &s;ent orders to his envoy at the Hague, to con|tinue
the conferences with the courts of France and Spain.
On the nineteenth day of April, the Marquis de Torcy
delivered to the Earl of Manche&s;ter, at Paris, a letter from
the new King of Spain to his Britannick Maje&s;ty, notify|ing
his acce&s;&s;ion to that throne, and expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire of
cultivating a mutual friend&s;hip with the King and crown
of England. How aver&s;e &s;oever William might have been
to any corre&s;pondence of this &s;ort, the Earl of Roche&s;ter
and the new mini&s;ters importuned him in &s;uch a manner
to acknowledge Philip, that he at length complied with
their entreaties: and wrote a civil an&s;wer to his Mo&s;t
Catholick Maje&s;ty. This was a very alarming incident to
the Emperor, who was bent upon a war with the two
crowns, and had determined to &s;end Prince Eugene with
an army into Italy, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the duchy of
Milan, as a &s;ie$ of the empire. The new Pope Clement
XI. who had &s;ucceeded to the papacy in the preceding
year, was attached to the French intere&s;t: the Venetians
favoured the Emperor; but they refu&s;ed to declare them|&s;elves
at this juncture.</P>
<P><PB N="377" REF="383">
&sect; XLIX.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VI. 1701.</NOTE> The French King con&s;ented to a renewal of
$he negociations at the Hague; but, in the mean time,
$ampered with the Dutch deputies, to engage them in a
&s;eparate treaty. Finding them determined to act in con|$ert
with the King of England, he protracted the confer|ences,
in order to gain time, while he erected fortifications,
and drew lines on the frontiers of Holland, divided the
princes of the empire by his intrigues, and endeavoured
$o gain over the &s;tates of Italy. The Dutch, mean while,
exerted them&s;elves in providing for their own &s;ecurity.
They re-enforced their garri&s;ons, purcha&s;ed &s;upplies, and
$ollicited &s;uccours from foreign potentates. The States
wrote a letter to King William, explaining the danger of
$heir &s;ituation, profe&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t inviolable attachment
$o the intere&s;t of England, and de&s;iring that the &s;tipulated
$umber of troops &s;hould be &s;ent immediately to their
$&s;&s;i&s;tance. The three Scotti&s;h regiments which he had
$etained in his own pay were immediately tran&s;ported
from Scotland. The letter of the States-General he
$ommunicated to the Hou&s;e of Commons, who having
$aken it into con&s;ideration, re&s;olved to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty to
&s;upport his allies in maintaining the liberty of Europe;
$nd to provide immediate &s;uccours for the States-Gene|ral,
according to the treaty of 1677. The Hou&s;e of Peers,
$o whom the letter was al&s;o communicated, carried their
$eal &s;till farther. They pre&s;ented an addre&s;s, in which
$hey de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty would not only perform the arti|$les
of any former treaty with the States-General, but
$l&s;o engage with them in a &s;trict league offen&s;ive and de|$en&s;ive,
for their common pre&s;ervation; and invite into
$word$ all the princes and &s;tates that were concerned in the
$re&s;ent vi&s;ible danger ari&s;ing from the union of France and
$pain. They exhorted him to enter into &s;uch alliances
$th the Emperor, as his Maje&s;ty &s;hould think nece&s;&s;ary,
$r&s;uant to the ends of the treaty concluded in the year
$689. They a&s;&s;ured him of their hearty and &s;incere a&s;&s;i&s;t|$$ce,
not doubting that Almighty God would protect his
$cred per&s;on in &s;o righteous a cau&s;e; and that the unani|mity,
<PB N="378" REF="384">
wealth, and courage of his &s;ubjects would carry him
with honour and &s;ucce&s;s through all the difficulties of $word$
ju&s;t war. La&s;tly, they took leave humbly to repre&s;ent
that the dangers to which his kingdom and allies had been
expo&s;ed, were chiefly owing to the fatal coun&s;els that pre|vented
his Maje&s;ty's &s;ooner meeting his people in parlia|ment.</P>
<P>&sect; L. The&s;e proceedings of both Hou&s;es could not but be
very agreeable to the King, who expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction
in his an&s;wer to each apart. They were the more remark|able,
as at this very time con&s;iderable progre&s;s was made
in a de&s;ign to impeach the old mini&s;try. This deviation$
therefore, from the tenour of their former conduct could
be owing to no other motive than a &s;en&s;e of their own
danger, and re&s;entment again&s;t France, which, even du|ring
the negociation, had been &s;ecretly employed in making
preparations to &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;tre&s;s the States-General.
The Commons having expre&s;&s;ed their &s;entiments on this
&s;ubject, re&s;umed the con&s;ideration of the partition-treaty.
They had appointed a committee to examine the journals
of the Hou&s;e of Lords, and to report their proceedings in
relation to the treaty of partition. When the report wa$
made by Sir Edward Seymour, the Hou&s;e re&s;olved it&s;elf
into a committee, to con&s;ider the &s;tate of the nation$
after warm debates, they re&s;olved, That William Earl o$
Portland, by negociating and concluding the treaty o$
partition, was guilty of a high crime and mi&s;demeanour&punc;
They ordered Sir John Leve&s;on Gower to impeach him a$
the bar of the Hou&s;e of Lords: and named a committee to
prepare the articles of his impeachment. Then, in a con|ference
with the Lords, they de&s;ired to know the parti|culars
of what had pa&s;&s;ed between the Earl of Portland an$
Secretary Vernon, in relation to the partition-treaty, a$
al&s;o what other information they had obtained concern|ing
negociations or treaties of partition of the Spani&s;h
monarchy. The Lords demurring to this demand, the
Lower Hou&s;e re&s;olved to addre&s;s the King, That copie$
of both treaties of partition, together with all the power$
<PB N="379" REF="385">
and in&s;tructions for negociating tho&s;e treaties, &s;hould be
laid before them. The copies were according produced,
and the Lords &s;ent down to the Commons two papers,
containing the powers granted to the Earls of Portland
and Jer&s;ey, for &s;igning both treaties of partition. The
Hou&s;e afterwards ordered, That Mr. Secretary Vernon
&s;hould lay before them all the letters which had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween
the Earl of Portland and him, in relation to tho&s;e
treaties; and he thought proper to obey their command.
Nothing could be more &s;candalou&s;ly partial than the con|duct
of the Commons on this occa&s;ion. They re&s;olved
to &s;kreen the Earl of Jer&s;ey, Sir Jo&s;eph William&s;on, and
Mr. Vernon, who had been as deeply concerned as any
others in that tran&s;action; and pointed all their vengeance
again&s;t the Earls of Portland and Orford, and the Lords
Somers and Hallifax. Some of the members even tam|pered
with Kidd, who was now a pri&s;oner in Newgate, to
accu&s;e Lord Somers as having encouraged him in his pi|racy.
He was brought to the bar of the Hou&s;e, and ex|amined:
but he declared that he had never &s;poke to Lord
Somers; and that he had no order from tho&s;e concerned
in the &s;hip, but that of pur&s;uing his voyage again&s;t the
pirates in Madaga&s;car. Finding him unfit for their pur|po&s;e,
they left him to the cour&s;e of law; and he was
hanged, with &s;ome of his accomplices.</P>
<P>&sect; LI. Lord Somers under&s;tanding that he was accu&s;ed
in the Hou&s;e of Commons of having con&s;ented to the par|tition
treaty, de&s;ired that he might be admitted and heard
in his own defence. His reque&s;t being granted, he told
the Hou&s;e, that when he received the King's letter con|cerning
the partition-treaty, with an order to &s;end over
the nece&s;&s;ary powers in the mo&s;t &s;ecret manner, he thought
it would have been taking too much upon him to put a
&s;top to a treaty of &s;uch con&s;equence, when the life of the
King of Spain was &s;o precarious; for, had the King died
before the treaty was fini&s;hed, and he been blamed for de|laying
the nece&s;&s;ary powers, he could not have ju&s;tified
his own conduct, &s;ince the King's letter was really a war|rant:
<PB N="380" REF="386">
that, neverthele&s;s, he had written a letter to hi$
Maje&s;ty, objecting to &s;everal particulars in the treaty, an$
propo&s;ing other articles which he thought were for the in$tere&s;t
of his country: that he thought him&s;elf bound t$
put the great &s;eal to the treaty when it was concluded
that, as a privy-coun&s;ellor, he had offered his be&s;t advice
and as chancellor, executed his office according to his duty
After he had withdrawn, his ju&s;tification gave ri&s;e to a long
debate, which ended in a re&s;olution carried by a majority
of &s;even voices, That John Lord Somers, by advi&s;ing hi$
Maje&s;ty to conclude the treaty of partition, whereby larg$
territories of the Spani&s;h monarchy were to be delivere$
up to France, was guilty of a high crime and mi&s;demean$our.
Votes to the &s;ame effect were pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t Edward
Earl of Orford, and Charles Lord Hallifax; and all three
were impeached at the bar of the Upper Hou&s;e. But the
Commons knowing that tho&s;e impeachments would pro|duce
nothing in the Hou&s;e of Lords, where the oppo&s;it$
intere&s;t predominated, they re&s;olved to proceed again&s;t th$
accu&s;ed noblemen in a more expeditious and effectual way
of branding their reputation. They voted and pre&s;ente$
an addre&s;s to the King, de&s;iring he would remove then$
from his councils and pre&s;ence for ever, as advi&s;ers of $word$
treaty &s;o pernicious to the trade and welfare of England
They concluded, by repeating their a&s;&s;urances, that they
would always &s;tand by and &s;upport his Maje&s;ty to the ut$mo&s;t
of their power, again&s;t all his enemies both at hom$
and abroad. Ths King, in his an&s;wer, artfully overlooke$
the fir&s;t part of the remon&s;trance. He thanked them fo$
their repeated a&s;&s;urances; and told them he would employ
none in his &s;ervice but &s;uch as &s;hould be thought mo&s;$
likely to improve that mutual tru&s;t and confidence betwee$
him and his people, which was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary at that con|juncture,
both for their own &s;ecurity and the pre&s;ervation
of their allies.</P>
<P>&sect; LII. The Lords, incen&s;ed at this &s;tep of the Commons
which they con&s;idered as an in&s;ult upon their tribunal
and a violation of common ju&s;tice, drew up and delivere$
<PB N="381" REF="387">
a counter-addre&s;s, humbly be&s;eeching his Maje&s;ty, that he
would not pa&s;s any cen&s;ure upon the accu&s;ed lords, until
they &s;hould be tried on the impeachments, and judgement
be given according to the u&s;age of parliament. The King
was &s;o perplexed by the&s;e oppo&s;ite repre&s;entations, that he
knew not well what cour&s;e to follow. He made no reply
to the counter-addre&s;s; but allowed the names of the im|peached
lords to remain in the council-books. The
Commons having carried their point, which was to &s;tig|matize
tho&s;e noblemen, and prevent their being employed
for the future, &s;uffered the impeachments to be neglected
until they them&s;elves moved for trial. On the fifth day of
May the Hou&s;e of Lords &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the Commons,
$mporting, That no articles had as yet been exhibited
again&s;t the noblemen whom they had impeached. The
charge was immediately drawn up again&s;t the Earl of Or|ford:
him they accu&s;ed of having received exorbitant
grants from the crown: of having been concerned with
Kidd the pirate: of having committed abu&s;es in manag|ing
and victualling the fleet, when it lay on the coa&s;t of
Spain; and la&s;tly, of having advi&s;ed the partition-treaty.
The Earl in his own defence declared, that he had re|ceived
no grant from the King, except a very di&s;tant re|ver&s;ion,
and a pre&s;ent of ten thou&s;and pounds, after he had
$lefeated the French at La Hogue: that in Kidd's affair he
had acted legally, and with a good intention towards the
publick, though to his own lo&s;s: that his accounts with
regard to the fleet which he commanded had been exa|mined
and pa&s;&s;ed; yet he was ready to wave the advan|tage,
and ju&s;tify him&s;elf in every particular: and he ab&s;o|lutely
denied that he had given any advice concerning the
$reaty of partition. Lord Somers was accu&s;ed of having
&s;et the &s;eals to the powers, and afterwards to the treaties:
of having accepted &s;ome grants: of having been an ac|complice
with Kidd; and of having been guilty of partial
$nd dilatory proceedings in chancery. He an&s;wered every
$rticle of the charge; but no replication was made by the
Commons, either to him or to the Earl of Orford. When
<PB N="382" REF="388">
the Commons were &s;timulated by another me&s;&s;age from
the Peers, relating to the impeachments of the Earl o$
Portland and Lord Hallifax, they declined exhibiting arti|cles
again&s;t the former, on pretence of re&s;pect for his Ma|je&s;ty;
but on the fourteenth of June the charge again&s;t
Hallifax was &s;ent up to the Lords. He was taxed with
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a grant in Ireland, without paying the produce
of it, according to the law lately enacted concerning tho&s;e
grants: with enjoying another grant out of the fore&s;t of
Deane, to the wa&s;te of the timber, and the prejudice of
the navy; with having held places that were incompati|ble,
by being at the &s;ame time commi&s;&s;ioner of the Trea|&s;ury,
and chancellor of the Exchequer; and with having
advi&s;ed the two treaties of partition. He an&s;wered, that
his grant in Ireland was of debts and &s;ums of money, not
within the act concerning confi&s;cated e&s;tates: that all he
had ever received from it did not exceed four hundred
pounds, which, if he was bound to repay, a common
action would lie again&s;t him; but every man was not to
be impeached who did not di&s;charge his debts at the very
day of payment. He ob&s;erved, that as his grant in the
fore&s;t of Deane extended to weedings only, it could occa&s;ion
no wa&s;te of timber, nor prejudice to the navy: that the
auditor's place was held by another per&s;on, until he ob|tained
the King's leave to withdraw from the Trea&s;ury
that he never &s;aw the fir&s;t treaty of partition, nor was hi$
advice a&s;ked upon the &s;ubject: that he had never heard o$
the &s;econd but once before it was concluded; and then he
&s;poke his &s;entiments freely on the &s;ubject. This an&s;wer$
like the others, would have been neglected by the Com|mons,
who&s;e aim was now to evade the trials, had no$
the Lords pre&s;&s;ed them by me&s;&s;ages to expedite the articles$
They even appointed a day for Orford's trial, and &s;ignifie$
their re&s;olutions to the Commons. The&s;e de&s;ired that $word$
committee of both Hou&s;es &s;hould be named for &s;ettling
preliminaries, one of which was, That the lord to b$
tried &s;hould not &s;it as a peer; and the other imported$
That tho&s;e lords impeached for the &s;ame matter &s;hould
<PB N="383" REF="389">
not vote in the trial of each other. They likewi&s;e de&s;ired
that Lord Somers &s;hould be fir&s;t tried. The Lords made
no objection to this la&s;t demand: but they rejected the pro|po&s;al
of a committee con&s;i&s;ting of both Hou&s;es, alledging,
that the Commons were parties, and had no title to &s;it
in equality with the judges, or to &s;ettle matters relating
to the trial; that this was a demand contrary to the prin|ciples
of law and rules of ju&s;tice, and never practi&s;ed in
any court or nation. The Lords, indeed, had yielded to
this expedient in the popi&s;h plot, becau&s;e it was a ca&s;e of
trea&s;on, in which the King's life and &s;afety of the kingdom
were concerned, while the people were jealous of the
court, and the whole nation was in a ferment: but at
pre&s;ent the times were quiet, and the charge amounted
to nothing more than mi&s;demeanours; therefore, the Lords
could not a&s;&s;ent to &s;uch a propo&s;al as was derogatory from
their juri&s;diction. Neither would they agree to the preli|minaries;
but, on the twelfth day of June, re&s;olved,
That no peer impeached for high crimes and mi&s;demea|nours,
&s;hould, upon his trial, be without the bar; and,
That no peer impeached could be precluded from voting
on any occa&s;ion, except in his own trial. Divers me&s;&s;ages
pa&s;&s;ed between the two hou&s;es; the Commons &s;till in&s;i&s;t|ing
upon a committee to &s;ettle preliminaries: at length
the di&s;pute was brought to a free conference.</P>
<P>&sect; LIII. Meanwhile, the King going to the Hou&s;e of
Peers, gave the royal a&s;&s;ent to the bill of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. In
his &s;peech he expre&s;&s;ed his warm acknowledgements for
their repeated a&s;&s;urances of &s;upporting him in &s;uch allian|ces
as &s;hould be mo&s;t proper for the pre&s;ervation of the
liberty of Europe, and for the &s;ecurity of England and
the States-General. He ob&s;erved, that the &s;ea&s;on of the
year was advanced: that the po&s;ture of affairs ab&s;olutely
required his pre&s;ence abroad: and he recommended di&s;|patch
of the publick bu&s;ine&s;s, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e matters
which were of the greate&s;t importance. The Commons
thanked him in an addre&s;s for having approved of their
proceedings: they declared they would &s;upport him in
<PB N="384" REF="390">
&s;uch alliances as he &s;hould think fit to make in conjunction
with the Emperor and the States-General, for the peace o$
Europe, and reducing the exorbitant power of France$
Then they re&s;umed their di&s;pute with the Upper Hou&s;e. In
the free conference, Lord Haver&s;ham happened to tax the
Commons with partiality, in impeaching &s;ome Lords and
&s;creening others, who were equally guilty of the &s;ame mi&s;de|meanours.
Sir Chri&s;topher Mu&s;grave and the managers
for th$ Commons immediately withdrew: this unguarded
&s;ally being reported to the Hou&s;e, they immediately re|&s;olved,
That John Lord Haver&s;ham had uttered mo&s;t
&s;candalous reproaches and fal&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, highly re|flecting
upon the honour and ju&s;tice of the Hou&s;e of
Commons, tending to a breach in the good corre&s;pond|ence
between the two Hou&s;es, and to the interruption of
the publick ju&s;tice of the nation: That the &s;aid Lord Ha|ver&s;ham
&s;hould be charged before the Lords for the &s;aid
words: That the Lords &s;hould be de&s;ired to proceed in
ju&s;tice again&s;t him, and to inflict upon him &s;uch puni&s;h|ment
as &s;o high an offence again&s;t the Commons did de|&s;erve.
The Commons had now found a pretence to ju&s;tify
their delay; and declared they would not renew the con|ference
until they &s;hould have received &s;atisfaction. Lord
Haver&s;ham offered to &s;ubmit to a trial; but in&s;i&s;ted o$
their fir&s;t proving the words which he was &s;aid to have
&s;poken. When this declaration was imparted to the Com|mons,
they &s;aid, the Lords ought to have cen&s;ured him
in a &s;ummary way, and &s;till refu&s;ed to renew the confer|ence.
The Lords, on the other hand, came to a re&s;olution&punc;
That there &s;hould not be a committee of both Hou&s;es con|cerning
the trial of the impeached lords. Then they re&s;olved&punc;
That Lord Somers &s;hould be tried in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall o$
Tue&s;day the &s;eventeenth day of June, and &s;ignified this re&s;o|lution
to the Lower Hou&s;e; reminding them at the &s;ame tim$
of the articles again&s;t the Earl of Portland. The Common$
refu&s;ed to appear, alledging, they were the only judges
and that the evidence was not yet prepared. They &s;en$
up the rea&s;ons of their non-appearance to the Hou&s;e o$
<PB N="385" REF="391">
Lords, where they were &s;upported by the new mini&s;try
and all the malcontents; and produced very warm de|bates.
The majority carried their point piecemeal, by
dint of different votes, again&s;t which very &s;evere prote&s;ts
were entered. On the day appointed for the trial, they
&s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the Commons, that they were going to
We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall. The other impeached lords a&s;ked leave,
and were permitted to withdraw. The articles of im|peachment
again&s;t Lord Somers, and his an&s;wers, being
read in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, and the Commons not appear|ing
to pro&s;ecute, the Lords adjourned to their own hou&s;e,
where they debated concerning the que&s;tion that was to
be put. This being &s;ettled, they returned to We&s;t|min&s;ter-hall;
and the que&s;tion being put, &startq;That John
Lord Somers be acquitted of the articles of impeach|ment
again&s;t him, exhibited by the Hou&s;e of Commons,
and all things therein contained; and, That the im|peachment
be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed,&endq; it was carried by a majority
of thirty-five. The Commons, exa&s;perated at the&s;e pro|ceedings,
re&s;olved, That the Lords had refu&s;ed ju&s;tice to
the Commons: That they had endeavoured to overturn
the right of impeachments lodged in the Commons by the
ancient con&s;titution of the kingdom: That all the ill con|&s;equences
which might attend the delay of the &s;upplies
given for the pre&s;ervation of the publick peace, and the
maintenance of the balance of Europe, would be owing to
tho&s;e who, to procure an indemnity for their own crimes,
had u&s;ed their utmo&s;t endeavours to make a breach between
the two Hou&s;es. The Lords &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the Commons,
giving them to under&s;tand, that they had acquitted Lord
Somers, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the impeachment, as nobody had
appeared to &s;upport the articles; and that they had ap|pointed
next Monday for the trial of the Earl of Orford.
They re&s;olved, That unle&s;s the charge again&s;t Lord
Haver&s;ham &s;hould be pro&s;ecuted by the Commons before
the end of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, the Lords would adjudge him inno|cent:
That the re&s;olutions of the Commons in their late
votes contained mo&s;t unju&s;t re&s;lexions on the honour and
<PB N="386" REF="392">
ju&s;tice of the Peers: That they were contrived to cover
their affected and unrea&s;onable delays in pro&s;ecuting the
impeached Lords: That they manife&s;tly tended to the de|&s;truction
of the judicature of the Lords; to the rendering
trials on impeachments impracticable for the future; and
to the &s;ubverting the con&s;titution of the Engli&s;h govern|ment:
That, therefore, whatever ill con&s;equences might
ari&s;e from the&s;o long deferring the &s;upplies for this year's
&s;ervice were to be attributed to the fatal council of the
putting off the meeting of a parliament &s;o long, and to
the unnece&s;&s;ary delays of the Hou&s;e of Commons. On
the twenty-third day of June, the articles of impeach|ment
again&s;t Edward Earl of Orford were read in We&s;t|min&s;ter-hall;
but the Hou&s;e of Commons having pre|viou&s;ly
ordered that none of their members &s;hould appear
at this pretended trial, tho&s;e articles were not &s;upported:
&s;o that his lord&s;hip was acquitted, and the impeachment
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. Next day, the impeachment again&s;t the Duke
of Leeds, which had lain &s;even years neglected, together
with tho&s;e again&s;t the Earl of Portland and Lord Hallifax,
as well as the charge again&s;t Lord Haver&s;ham, were di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
for want of pro&s;ecution. Each Hou&s;e ordered a
narrative of the&s;e proceedings to be publi&s;hed; and their
mutual animo&s;ity had proceeded to &s;uch a degree of ran|cour,
as &s;eemed to preclude all po&s;&s;ibility of reconcilia|tion.
The Commons, in the whole cour&s;e of this tran&s;|action,
had certainly acted from motives of faction
and revenge; for nothing could be more unju&s;t, frivolous,
and partial, than the charge exhibited in the articles of
impeachment, their anticipating addre&s;s to the King, and
their affected delay in the pro&s;ecutions. Their conduct on
this occa&s;ion was &s;o flagrant as to attract the notice of the
common people, and in&s;pire the generality of the nation
with di&s;gu&s;t. This the Whigs did not fail to augment by
the arts of calumny, and, in particular, by in&s;inuating
that the court of Ver&s;ailles had found means to engage the
majority of the Commons in its intere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="393">
&sect; LIV. This faction had, &s;ince the beginning of this
&s;e&s;&s;ion, employed their emi&s;&s;aries in exciting a popular
aver&s;ion to the Tory mini&s;ters and members, and &s;uc|ceeded
&s;o well in their endeavours, that they formed a
&s;cheme of obtaining petitions from different counties and
corporations, that &s;hould induce the Commons to alter
their conduct, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that it was contrary to
the &s;en&s;e of the nation. In execution of this &s;cheme a pe|tition,
&s;igned by the deputy-lieutenants, above twenty
ju&s;tices of the peace, the grand jury and freeholders of the
county of Kent, had been pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e of
Commons on the eighteenth day of May, by five gentle|men
of fortune and di&s;tinction. The purport of this re|mon&s;trance
was, to recommend union among them&s;elves,
and confidence in his Maje&s;ty, who&s;e great actions for
the nation could never be forgot without the blacke&s;t in|gratitude$:
to beg they would have regard to the voice of
the people; that their religion and &s;afety might be effec|tually
provided for; that their royal addre&s;&s;es might be
turned into bills of &s;upply; and that his mo&s;t &s;acred Ma|je&s;ty
might be enabled powerfully to a&s;&s;i&s;t his allies before
it &s;hould be too late. The Hou&s;e was &s;o incen&s;ed at the
petulance of the petition, that they voted it &s;candalous,
in&s;olent, and &s;editious; and ordered the gentlemen who
had pre&s;ented it to be taken into cu&s;tody. They were
afterwards committed to the Gate-hou&s;e, where they re|mained
till the prorogation of parliament: but they had
no rea&s;on to repine at their impri&s;onment, which recom|mended
them to the notice and e&s;teem of the publick.
They were vi&s;ited and care&s;&s;ed by the chiefs of the Whig-intere&s;t,
and con&s;idered as martyrs to the liberties of the
people. Their confinement gave ri&s;e to a very extraordinary
paper, intitled, &startq;A Memorial from the gentlemen, free|holders,
and inhabitants, of the counties of&mdash;, in be|half
of them&s;elves, and many thou&s;ands of the good people
of England.&endq; It was &s;igned Legion, and &s;ent to the
Speaker in a letter, commanding him, in the name of two
hundred thou&s;and Engli&s;hmen, to deliver it to the Hou&s;e
<PB N="388" REF="394">
of Commons. In this &s;trange expo&s;tulation, the Hou&s;e
was charged with illegal and unwarrantable practices, in
fifteen particulars: a new claim of right was ranged under
&s;even heads; and the Commons were admoni&s;hed to act
according to their duty, as &s;pecified in this memorial, on
pain of incurring the refentment of an injured nation. It
was concluded in the&s;e words: &startq;For Engli&s;hmen are no
more to be &s;laves to parliaments than to kings&mdash;our
name is Legion, and we are many.&endq; The Commons
were equally provoked and intimidated by this libel, which
was the production of one Daniel de Foe, a &s;currilous
party-writer, in very little e&s;timation. They would not,
however, deign to take notice of it in the Hou&s;e: but a
complaint being made of endeavours to rai&s;e tumults and
&s;editions, a committee was appointed to draw up an ad|dre&s;s
to his Maje&s;ty, informing him of tho&s;e &s;editious en|deavours,
and be&s;eeching him to provide for the publick
peace and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>&sect; LV. The Hou&s;e, however, perceiving plainly that
they had incurred the odium of the nation, which began
to clamour for a war with France, and dreading the po|pular
re&s;entment, thought fit to change their mea&s;ures
with re&s;pect to this object, and pre&s;ent the addre&s;s w$
have already mentioned, in which they promi&s;ed to &s;up|port
him in the alliances he &s;hould contract with the
Emperor and other &s;tates, in order to bridle the exorbitant
power of France. They likewi&s;e proceeded in earne&s;t
upon the &s;upply, and voted funds for rai&s;ing about two
millions &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds, to defray the
expen&s;e of the en&s;uing year. They voted thirty thou&s;and
&s;eamen, and re&s;olved that ten thou&s;and troops &s;hould be
tran&s;ported from Ireland to Holland, as the auxiliaries
&s;tipulated in the treaty of 1677 with the States-General.
The $unds were con&s;tituted of a land-tax, cer|tain
duties on merchandi&s;e, and a weekly deduction from
the Exci&s;e, &s;o as to bring down the civil li&s;t to &s;ix hun|dred
thou&s;and pounds; as the Duke of Glouce&s;ter was
dead, and James's queen refu&s;ed her allowance. They
<PB N="389" REF="395">
pa&s;&s;ed a bill for taking away all privilege of parliament in
legal pro&s;ecutions, during the intermediate prorogations:
their la&s;t &s;truggle with the Lords was concerning a bill
for appointing commi&s;&s;ioners to examine and &s;tate the pub|lick
accounts. The per&s;ons nominated for this purpo&s;e
were extremely obnoxious to the majority of the Peers, as
violent parti&s;ans of the Tory faction: when the bill,
therefore, was &s;ent up to the Lords, they made &s;ome
amendments, which the Commons rejected. The former
animo&s;ity between the two Hou&s;es began to revive, when
the King interrupted their di&s;putes, by putting an end to
the &s;e&s;&s;ion, on the twenty-fourth day of June, after
having thanked the parliament for their zeal in the pub|lick
&s;ervice, and exhorted them to a di&s;charge of their
duties in their &s;everal counties. He was, no doubt, ex|tremely
plea&s;ed with &s;uch an i&s;&s;ue of a &s;e&s;&s;ion that had
begun with a very inau&s;picious a&s;pect. His health daily
declined: but he concealed the decay of his con&s;titution,
that his allies might not be di&s;couraged from engaging in
a confederacy of which he was deemed the head and chief
&s;upport. He conferred the command of the ten thou&s;and
troops de&s;tined for Holland upon the Earl of Marlbo|rough,
and appointed him, at the &s;ame time, his plenipo|tentiary
to the States-General: a choice that evinced his
di&s;cernment and di&s;cretion; for that nobleman &s;urpa&s;&s;ed
all his cotemporaries, both as a general and a politician.
He was cool, penetrating, intrepid, and per&s;evering,
plau&s;ible, in&s;inuating, artful, and di&s;&s;embling.</P>
<P>&sect; LVI. A regency being e&s;tabli&s;hed, the King embarked
for Holland in the beginning of July. On his arrival at
the Hague he a&s;&s;i&s;ted at an a&s;&s;embly of the States-General,
whom he harangued in very affectionate terms, and was
an&s;wered with great cordiality: then he made a progre&s;s
round the frontiers, to examine the &s;tate of the garri&s;ons;
and gave &s;uch orders and directions as he judged nece&s;&s;ary
for the defence of the country. Mean while, the French
mini&s;ter D'Avaux being recalled from the Hague, deli|vered
a letter to the States from the French King, who
<PB N="390" REF="396">
complained that they had often interrupted the conferences,
from which no good fruits were to be expected: but he
a&s;&s;ured them it wholly depended upon them&s;elves, whether
they &s;hould continue to receive marks of his ancient friend|&s;hip
for their republick. This letter was accompanied
by an in&s;olent memorial, to which the States-General
returned a very &s;pirited an&s;wer. As they expected nothing
now but ho&s;tilities from France, they redoubled their dili|gence
in making preparations for their own defence. They
repaired their fortifications, augmented their army, and
hired auxiliaries. King William and they had already
engaged in an alliance with the King of Denmark, who
undertook to furni&s;h a certain number of troops, in con|&s;ideration
of a &s;ub&s;idy; and they endeavoured to mediate
a peace between Sweden and Poland: but this they could
not effect. France had likewi&s;e offered her mediation be|tween
tho&s;e powers, in hopes of bringing over Sweden to
her intere&s;t; and the court of Vienna had tampered with
the King of Poland; but he per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution to
pro&s;ecute the war. The Spaniards began to be very un|ea&s;y
under the dominion of their new ma&s;ter. They were
&s;hocked at the in&s;olence of his French mini&s;ters and at|tendants,
and much more at the manners and fa&s;hions which
they introduced. The grandees found them&s;elves very
little con&s;idered by their &s;overeign; and re&s;ented his oeco|nomy;
for he had endeavoured to retrench the expen&s;e of
the court, which had u&s;ed to &s;upport their magnificence.
Prince Eugene, at the head of the Imperial army, had
entered Italy by Vicenza, and pa&s;&s;ed the Adige near Carpi,
where he defeated a body of five thou&s;and French forces.
The enemy were commanded by the Duke of Savoy,
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Mare&s;chal Catinat and the Prince of Vaude|mont,
who did not think proper to hazard an engage|ment:
but Mare&s;chal Villeroy arriving in the latter end of
Augu&s;t, with orders to attack the Imperiali&s;ts, Catinat
retired in di&s;gu&s;t. The new general marched immediately
towards Chiari, where Prince Eugene was entrenched,
and attacked his camp; but met with &s;uch a reception,
<PB N="391" REF="397">
that he was obliged to retire with the lo&s;s of five thou&s;and
men. Towards the end of the campaign the Prince took
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the Mantuan territories, except Mantua
it&s;elf, and Goito, the blockade of which he formed. He
reduced all the places on the Oglio, and continued in the
field during the whole winter, exhibiting repeated marks
of the mo&s;t invincible courage, indefatigable vigilance,
and exten&s;ive capacity in the art of war. In January he
had well nigh &s;urpri&s;ed Cremona, by introducing a body
of men through an old aqueduct. They forced one of the
gates, by which the Prince and his followers entered:
Villeroy being wakened by the noi&s;e, ran out into the
&s;treet, where he was taken; and the town mu&s;t have been
infallibly reduced, had Prince Eugene been joined by
another body of troops, which he had ordered to march
from the Parme&s;an, and &s;ecure the bridge. The&s;e not ar|riving
at the time appointed, an Iri&s;h regiment in the
French &s;ervice took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bridge, and the Prince
was obliged to retire with his pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>&sect; LVII. The French King, alarmed at the activity
and military genius of the Imperial general, &s;ent a re-en|forcement
to his army in Italy, and the Duke of Ven|dome
to command his forces in that country: he likewi&s;e
importuned the Duke of Savoy to a&s;&s;i&s;t him effectually:
but that Prince having obtained all he could expect from
France, became cold and backward. His &s;econd daugh|ter
was by this time married to the new King of Spain,
who met her at Barcelona, where he found him&s;elf in|volved
in di&s;putes with the &s;tates of Catalonia, who refu&s;|ed
to pay a tax he had impo&s;ed, until their privileges
&s;hould be confirmed; and he was obliged to gratify them
in this particular.&mdash;The war continued to rage in the
North. The young King of Sweden routed the Saxons
upon the river Danu: thence he marched into Courland,
and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mittau without oppo&s;ition; while
the King of Poland retired into Lithuania. In Hungary
the French emi&s;&s;aries endeavoured to &s;ow the &s;eeds of a
new revolt. They exerted them&s;elves with indefatigable
<PB N="392" REF="398">
indu&s;try in almo&s;t every court of Chri&s;tendom. They
had already gained over the Elector of Bavaria, and his
brother, the Elector of Cologn, together with the Dukes
of Wolfenbuttle and Saxa-gotha, who profe&s;&s;ed neutrali|ty,
while they levied troops, and made &s;uch preparations
for war, as plainly indicated that they had received &s;ub&s;i|dies
from France. Louis had al&s;o extorted a treaty of al|liance
from the King of Portugal, who was per&s;onally at|tached
to the Au&s;trian intere&s;t: but this weak prince
was a &s;lave to his mini&s;ters, whom the French King had
corrupted. During this &s;ummer the French coa&s;ts were
over-awed by the combined fleets of England and Holland,
under the command of Sir George Rooke, who &s;ailed
down the channel in the latter end of Augu&s;t, and de|tached
Vice-Admiral Benbow with a &s;trong &s;quadron to
the We&s;t-Indies. In order to deceive the French King,
with regard to the de&s;tination of this fleet, King William
demanded the free u&s;e of the Spani&s;h harbours, as if his
de&s;ign had been to &s;end a &s;quadron to the Mediterranean:
but he met with a repul&s;e, while the French &s;hips were
freely admitted. About this period the King revoked his
letters-patent to the commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty, and
con&s;tituted the Earl of Pembroke lord-high Admiral of
England, in order to avoid the factions, the di&s;putes, and
divided coun&s;els of a board. The Earl was no &s;ooner
promoted to this office, than he &s;ent Captain Loades with
three &s;rigates to Cadiz, to bring home the &s;ea-&s;tores and
effects belonging to the Engli&s;h in that place, before the
war &s;hould commence; and this piece of &s;ervice was &s;uc|ce&s;sfully
performed. The French King, in order to en|joy
all the advantages that could be derived from his union
with Spain, e&s;tabli&s;hed a company, to open a trade with
Mexico and P$ru; and concluded a new a&s;&s;iento treaty
for &s;upplying the Spani&s;h plantations with Negroes. At
the &s;ame time, he &s;ent a &s;trong &s;quadron to the port of
Cadiz. The French dre&s;s was introduced into the court
of Spain; and, by a formal edict, the grandees of that
kingdom and the peers of France were put on a level in
<PB N="393" REF="399">
each nation. There was no vigour left in the councils of
Spain: her finances were exhau&s;ted; and her former &s;pi|rit
&s;eemed to be quite extingui&s;hed: the nobility were
beggars, and the common people overwhelmed with indi|gence
and di&s;tre&s;s. The condition of France was not
much more pro&s;perous. She had been harra&s;&s;ed by a long
war, and now &s;aw her&s;elf on the eve of another, which
in all probability would render her completely mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>&sect; LVIII. The&s;e circum&s;tances were well known to
the Emperor and the maritime powers, and &s;erved to ani|mate
their negociations for another grand alliance. Con|ferences
were opened at the Hague; and, on the &s;eventh
day of September, a treaty was concluded between his
Imperial Maje&s;ty, England, and the States-General. The
objects propo&s;ed, were to procure &s;atisfaction to the Em|peror
in the Spani&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for
the dominions and commerce of the allies. They engaged
to u&s;e their endeavours for recovering the Spani&s;h Nether|lands,
as a barrier between Holland and France; and for
putting the Emperor in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the duchy of Milan,
Naples, and Sicily, with the lands and i&s;lands upon the
coa&s;t of Tu&s;cany belonging to the Spani&s;h dominions.
They agreed, that the King of England, and the States-General,
&s;hould keep and po&s;&s;e&s;s whatever lands and ci|ties
they could conquer from the Spaniards in the Indies:
That the confederates &s;hould faithfully communicate their
de&s;igns to one another: That no party &s;hould treat of
peace, or truce, but jointly with the re&s;t: That they
&s;hould concur in preventing the union of France and
Spain under the &s;ame government; and hinder the French
from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Spani&s;h Indies: That, in concluding
a peace, the confederates &s;hould provide for the main|tenance
of the commerce carried on by the maritime
powers to the dominions taken from the Spaniards, and
&s;ecure the &s;tates by a barrier: That they &s;hould, at the
&s;ame time, &s;ettle the exerci&s;e of religion in the new con|que&s;ts:
That they &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t one another with all their
forces, in ca&s;e of being invaded by the French King, or
<PB N="394" REF="400">
any other potentate, on account of this alliance: That a
defen&s;ive alliance &s;hould remain between them, even af|ter
the peace: That all kings, princes, and &s;tates &s;hould
be at liberty to engage in this alliance. They determin|ed
to employ two months, to obtain, by amicable means,
the &s;atisfaction and &s;ecurity which they demanded; and
&s;tipulated, that within &s;ix weeks the treaty &s;hould be ra|tified.</P>
<P>&sect; LIX. On the &s;ixteenth day of September, King James
expired at St. Germain's, after having laboured under a
tedious indi&s;po&s;ition. This unfortunate monarch, &s;ince
the mi&s;carriage of his la&s;t attempt for recovering his throne,
had laid a&s;ide all thought of worldly grandeur, and de|voted
his whole attention to the concerns of his &s;oul.
Though he could not prevent the bu&s;y genius of his
Queen from planning new &s;chemes of re&s;toration, he was
always be&s;t plea&s;ed when wholly detached from &s;uch chi|merical
projects. Hunting was his chief diver&s;ion; but
religion was his con&s;tant care. Nothing could be more
harmle&s;s than the life he led; and, in the cour&s;e of it, he
&s;ubjected him&s;elf to uncommon penance and mortificati|on.
He frequently vi&s;ited the poor monks of La Trappe,
who were much edified by his humble and pious deport|ment.
His pride and arbitrary temper &s;eem to have vani&s;h|ed
with his greatne&s;s He became affable, kind and ea&s;y
to all his dependents; and his religion certainly opened
and improved the virtues of his heart, though it &s;eemed
to impair the faculties of his &s;oul. In his la&s;t illne&s;s he
conjured his &s;on to prefer his religion to every worldly
advantage, and even to renounce all thoughts of a crown,
if he could not enjoy it without offering violence to his
faith. He recommended to him the practice of ju&s;tice
and Chri&s;tian forgivene&s;s; he him&s;elf declaring, that
he heartily forgave the Prince of Orange, the Emperor,
and all his enemies. He died with great marks of devo|tion,
and was interred, at his own reque&s;t, in the
church of the Engli&s;h Benedictines in Paris, without any
funeral &s;olemnity.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="401">
&sect; LX. Before his death he was vi&s;ited by the French
King, who &s;eemed touched with his condition, and de|clared,
that, in ca&s;e of his death, he would own his &s;on as
King of England. This promi&s;e James's Queen had al|ready
extorted from him, by the intere&s;t of Madame de
Maintenon and the Dauphin. Accordingly, when James
died, the pretended Prince of Wales was proclaimed King
of England at St. Germain's, and treated as &s;uch at the
court of Ver&s;ailles. His title was likewi&s;e recognized by
the King of Spain, the Duke of Savoy, and the Pope.
William was no &s;ooner informed of this tran&s;action, than
he di&s;patched a courier to the King of Sweden, as guaran|tee
of the treaty of Ry&s;wick, to complain of this manife&s;t
violation. At the &s;ame time, he recalled the Earl of Man|che&s;ter
from Paris, and ordered him to return without
taking an audience of leave. That nobleman immediately
withdrew, after having intimated to the Marquis de Torcy
the order he had received. Louis, in vindication of his
own conduct, di&s;per&s;ed through all the courts of Europe
a manife&s;to, in which he affirmed, that in owning the
Prince of Wales as King of England he had not infringed
any article of the treaty of Ry&s;wick. He confe&s;&s;ed, that
in the fourth article, he had promi&s;ed that he would not
di&s;turb the King of Great-Britain in the peaceable po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of his dominions; and he declared his intention
was to ob&s;erve that promi&s;e punctually. He ob&s;erved,
that his genero&s;ity would not allow him to abandon the
Prince of Wales or his family: that he could not refu&s;e
him a title which was due to him by birth; that he had
more rea&s;on to complain of the King of Great-Britain,
and the States-General, who&s;e declarations and prepara|tions
in favour of the Emperor might be regarded as real
contraventions to treaties: finally, he quoted &s;ome in|&s;tances
from hi&s;tory, in which the children enjoyed the
titles of kingdoms which their fathers had lo&s;t. The&s;e
rea&s;ons, however, would hardly have induced the French
King to take &s;uch a &s;tep, had not he perceived that a war
with England was inevitable; and that he &s;hould be able
<PB N="396" REF="402">
to reap &s;ome advantages in the cour&s;e of it, from e&s;pou&s;|ing
the cau&s;e of the Pretender.</P>
<P>&sect; LXI. The &s;ub&s;tance of the French manife&s;to was
publi&s;hed in London, by Pou&s;&s;in, the &s;ecretary of Tal|lard,
who had been left in England, as agent for the
court of Ver&s;ailles. He was now ordered to leave the
kingdom, which was filled with indignation at Louis,
for having pretended to declare who ought to be their &s;o|vereign.
The city of London pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the
lords-ju&s;tices, expre&s;&s;ing the deepe&s;t re&s;entment of the
French King's pre&s;umption; a&s;&s;uring his Maje&s;ty, that
they would, at all times, exert the utmo&s;t of their abili|ties
for the pre&s;ervation of his per&s;on, and the defence of
his ju&s;t rights, in oppo&s;ition to all invaders of his crown
and dignity. Addre&s;&s;es of the &s;ame nature were &s;ent up
from all parts of the kingdom, and could not but be
agreeable to William. He had now concerted mea&s;ures
for acting with vigour again&s;t France; and he re&s;olved to
revi&s;it his kingdom, after having made a con&s;iderable pro|gre&s;s
in a treaty of perpetual alliance between England and
the States-General, which was afterwards brought to per|fection
by his plenipotentiary, the Earl of Marlborough.
The King's return, however, was delayed a whole month
by a &s;evere indi&s;po&s;ition, during which the Spani&s;h mini&s;ter
De Quiros hired certain phy&s;icians, to con&s;ult together
upon the &s;tate and nature of his di&s;temper. They de|clared,
that he could not outlive many weeks; and this
opinion was tran&s;mitted to Madrid. William, however,
baffled the progno&s;tick, though his con&s;titution had &s;u|&s;tained
&s;uch a rude &s;hock, that he him&s;elf perceived his
end was near. He told the Earl of Portland, he found
him&s;elf &s;o weak, that he could not expect to live another
&s;ummer: but charged him to conceal this circum&s;tance
until he &s;hould be dead. Notwith&s;tanding this near ap|proach
to di&s;&s;olution, he exerted him&s;elf with &s;urpri&s;ing
diligence and &s;pirit in e&s;tabli&s;hing the confederacy, and
&s;ettling the plan of operations. A &s;ub&s;idiary treaty was
concluded with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who engaged to
<PB N="397" REF="403">
furni&s;h a certain number of troops. The Emperor agreed
to maintain ninety thou&s;and men in the field again&s;t
France, the proportion of the &s;tates was limited to one
hundred and two thou&s;and; and that of England did not
exceed forty thou&s;and, to act in conjunction with the
allies.</P>
<P>&sect; LXII. On the fourth day of November the King ar|rived
in England, which he found in a &s;trange ferment,
produced from the mutual animo&s;ity of the two factions.
They reviled each other in words and writing with all
the fal&s;ehood of calumny, and all the bitterne&s;s of rancour;
&s;o that truth, candour, and temperance &s;eemed to be ba|ni&s;hed
by con&s;ent of both parties. The king had found
him&s;elf deceived in his new mini&s;ters, who had oppo&s;ed
his mea&s;ures with all their influence. He was particularly
di&s;gu&s;ted with the deportment of the Earl of Roche&s;ter,
who proved altogether imperious and untractable; and,
in&s;tead of moderating, inflamed the violence of his party.
The King declared the year in which that nobleman di|rected
his councils was the unea&s;ie&s;t of his whole life.
He could not help expre&s;&s;ing his di&s;plea&s;ure in &s;uch a
coldne&s;s of re&s;erve, that Roche&s;ter told him he would
&s;erve his Maje&s;ty no longer, &s;ince he did not enjoy his
confidence. William made no an&s;wer to this expo&s;tu|lation,
but re&s;olved he would &s;ee him no more. The
Earl however, at the de&s;ire of Mr. Harley, became more
pliant and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive; and, after the King's departure
for Holland, repaired to his government of Ireland, in
which he now remained, exerting all his endeavours to
acquire popularity. William fore&s;eeing nothing but
oppo&s;ition from the pre&s;ent &s;pirit of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons,
clo&s;etted &s;ome of their leaders, with a view to be|&s;peak
their compliance: but finding them determined to
pur&s;ue their former principles, and to in&s;i&s;t upon their
impeachments, he re&s;olved, with the advice of his friends,
to di&s;&s;olve the parliament. This &s;tep he was the more
ea&s;ily induced to take, as the Commons were become ex|tremely
odious to the nation in general, which breathed
<PB N="398" REF="404">
nothing but war and defiance again&s;t the French monarch.
The parliament was accordingly di&s;&s;olved by proclamation,
and another &s;ummoned to meet on the thirtieth day of
December.</P>
<P>&sect; LXIII. Never did the two parties proceed with &s;uch
heat and violence again&s;t each other, as in their endeavours
to influence the new elections. The Whigs, however,
obtained the victory, as they included the monied-intere&s;t,
which will always prevail among the borough-electors.
Corruption was now reduced into an open and avowed
commerce; and had not the people been &s;o univer&s;ally
venal and profligate, that no &s;en&s;e of &s;hame remained, the
victors mu&s;t have blu&s;hed for their &s;ucce&s;s. Though the
majority thus obtained was &s;taunch to the mea&s;ures of
the court, the choice of Speaker fell upon Mr. Harley,
contrary to the inclination of the King, who favoured
Sir Thomas Lyttelton: but his Maje&s;ty's &s;peech was re|ceived
with univer&s;al applau&s;e. It was &s;o much admired
by the well-wi&s;hers to the Revolution, that they printed
it with decorations, in the Engli&s;h, Dutch, and French
languages. It appeared as a piece of furniture in all their hou|&s;es,
and as the king's la&s;t legacy to his own and all prote&s;t|ant
people. In this celebrated harangue, he expatiated up|on
the indignity offered to the nation by the French King's
acknowledging the pretended Prince of Wales: he ex|plained
the dangers to which it was expo&s;ed, by his placing
his grand&s;on on the throne of Spain: he gave them to
under&s;tand he had concluded &s;everal alliances, according
to the encouragement given him by both Hou&s;es of parlia|ment,
which alliances &s;hould be laid before them, together
with other treaties &s;till depending. He ob&s;erved, that the
eyes of all Europe were upon this parliament; and all
matters at a &s;tand, until their re&s;olution &s;hould be known:
therefore, no time ought to be lo&s;t. He told them they
had yet an opportunity to &s;ecure for them&s;elves and their
po&s;terity the quiet enjoyment of their religion and liber|ties,
if they were not wanting to them&s;elves, but would
exert the ancient vigour of the Engli&s;h nation: but he de|clared
<PB N="399" REF="405">
his opinion was, that &s;hould they neglect this occa&s;ion,
they had no rea&s;on to hope for another. He &s;aid it would
be nece&s;&s;ary to maintain a great &s;trength at &s;ea, and a force
on land proportionable to that of their allies. He pre&s;&s;ed
the Commons to &s;upport the publick credit, which could
not be pre&s;erved without keeping &s;acred that maxim,
That they &s;hall never be lo&s;ers who tru&s;t to a parliamen|tary
&s;ecurity. He declared, that he never a&s;ked aids from
his people without regret: that what he de&s;ired was for
their own &s;afety and honour, at &s;uch a critical time; and
that the whole &s;hould be appropriated to the purpo&s;es for
which it was intended. He expre&s;&s;ed his willingne&s;s that
the accounts &s;hould be yearly &s;ubmitted to the in&s;pection
of parliament. He again recommended di&s;patch, together
with good bills for employing the poor, encouraging trade,
and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing vice. He expre&s;&s;ed his hope that they
were come together, determined to avoid di&s;putes and
differences, and to act with a hearty concurrence for pro|moting
the common cau&s;e. He &s;aid he &s;hould think it as
great a ble&s;&s;ing as could befal England, if they were as
much inclined to lay a&s;ide tho&s;e unhappy fatal animo&s;ities
which divided and weakened them, as he was di&s;po&s;ed to
make all his &s;ubjects &s;afe and ea&s;y, as to any, even the
highe&s;t offences committed again&s;t his per&s;on. He con|jured
them to di&s;appoint the hopes of their enemies by
their unanimity. As he had always &s;hewn, and always would
&s;how, how de&s;irous he was to be the common father of all
his people, he de&s;ired they would lay a&s;ide parties and di|vi&s;ions,
&s;o as that no di&s;tinction &s;hould be heard of among&s;t
them, but of tho&s;e who were friends to the prote&s;tant re|ligion
and pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, and of tho&s;e who wi&s;hed for
a popi&s;h prince and a French government. He concluded by
affirming, that if they, in good earne&s;t, de&s;ired to &s;ee
England hold the balance of Europe, and be indeed at the
head of the prote&s;tant intere&s;t, it would appear by their
improving the pre&s;ent opportunity. The Lords imme|diately
drew up a warm and affectionate addre&s;s, in which
they expre&s;&s;ed their re&s;entment of the proceedings of the
<PB N="400" REF="406">
French King, in owning the pretended Prince of Wales for
King of England. They a&s;&s;ured his Maje&s;ty they would
a&s;&s;i&s;t him to the utmo&s;t of their power again&s;t all his ene|mies;
and when it &s;hould plea&s;e God to deprive them of
his Maje&s;ty's protection, they would vigorou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;t and
defend again&s;t the pretended Prince of Wales, and all
other pretenders what&s;oever, every per&s;on and per&s;ons
who had right to &s;ucceed to the crown of England, by
virtue of the acts of parliament for e&s;tabli&s;hing and limit|ing
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. On the fifth of January, an addre&s;s
to the &s;ame effect was pre&s;ented by the Commons, and
both met with a very gracious reception from his Maje&s;ty.
The Lords, as a further proof of their zeal, having taken
into con&s;ideration the dangers that threatened Europe,
from the acce&s;&s;ion of the Duke of Anjou to the crown of
Spain, drew up another addre&s;s, explaining their &s;en&s;e
of that danger; &s;tigmati&s;ing the French King as a viola|tor
of treaties; declaring their opinion, that his Maje&s;ty,
his &s;ubjects, and allies, could never be &s;afe and &s;ecure,
until the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria &s;hould be re&s;tored to their
rights, and the invader of the Spani&s;h monarchy brought
to rea&s;on; and a&s;&s;uring his Maje&s;ty that no time &s;hould
be lo&s;t, nor any thing wanting on their parts, which might
an&s;wer the rea&s;onable expectations of their friends abroad;
not doubting but to &s;upport the reputation of the Engli&s;h
name, when engaged under &s;o great a prince, in the glo|rious
cau&s;e of maintaining the liberty of Europe.</P>
<P>&sect; LXIV. The King, in order to acquire the confidence
of the Commons, ordered Mr. Secretary Vernon to lay
before them copies of the treaties and conventions he had
lately concluded, which were &s;o well approved, that the
Hou&s;e unanimou&s;ly voted the &s;upply. By another vote,
they authori&s;ed the Exchequer to borrow &s;ix hundred
thou&s;and pounds at &s;ix percent. for the &s;ervice of the &s;leet
and fifty thou&s;and pounds for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of guards and
garri&s;ons. They deliberated upon the &s;tate of the navy,
with the debt due upon it, and examined an e&s;timate of
what would by nece&s;&s;ary for extraordinary repairs. They
<PB N="401" REF="407">
called for an account of that part of the national debt for
which no provi&s;ion had been made. They ordered the
Speaker to write to the tru&s;tees for the forfeited e&s;tates in
Ireland, to attend the Hou&s;e with a full detail of their pro|ceedings
in the execution of that act of parliament. On
the ninth day of January, they unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, That
leave be given to bring in a bill for &s;ecuring his Maje&s;ty's
per&s;on, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown in the prote&s;tant
line, for extingui&s;hing the hopes of the pretended Prince
of Wales, and all other pretenders, and their open and
&s;ecret abettors. They re&s;olved to addre&s;s his Maje&s;ty,
that he would in&s;ert an article in all his treaties of alliance,
importing, That no peace &s;hould be made with France,
until his Maje&s;ty and the nation have reparation for the
great indignity offered by the French King, in owning,
and declaring the pretended Prince of Wales King of
England, Scotland, and Ireland. They agreed to main|tain
forty thou&s;and men for the &s;ea &s;ervice, and a like num|ber
by land, to act in conjunction with the forces of the
allies, according to the proportions &s;ettled by the contract|ing
powers. The &s;upplies were rai&s;ed by an impo&s;ition of
four &s;hillings in the pound upon lands, annuities, pen&s;ions,
and &s;tipends, and on the profits ari&s;ing from the different
profe&s;&s;ions: by a tax of two and one-half per cent. on all
&s;tock in trade, and money at intere&s;t; of five &s;hillings in
the pound on all &s;alaries, fees, and perqui&s;ites; a capitation
tax of four &s;hillings: an impo&s;ition of one per cent. on
all &s;hares in the capital &s;tock of any corporation or com|pany
which &s;hould be bought, &s;old, or bargained for; a
duty of &s;ixpence per bu&s;hel on malt, and a further duty
on mum, cider, and perry.</P>
<P>&sect; LXV. The Commons &s;eemed to vie with the Lords
in their zeal for the government. They brought in a bill
for attainting the pretended Prince of Wales, which being
&s;ent up to the other Hou&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed with an additional
clau&s;e of attainder again&s;t the Queen, who acted as re|gent
for the Pretender. This, however, was not carried
without great oppo&s;ition in the Hou&s;e of Lords. When
<PB N="402" REF="408">
the bill was &s;ent back to the Commons, they excepted to
the amendment as irregular. They ob&s;erved, that at|tainders
by bill con&s;tituted the mo&s;t rigorous part of the
law; and that the &s;tretching of it ought to be avoided.
They propo&s;ed, that the Queen &s;hould be attainted by a
&s;eparate bill. The Lords a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;al: and the
bill again&s;t the pretended Prince of Wales pa&s;&s;ed. The
Lords pa&s;&s;ed another for attainting the Queen; however,
it was neglected in the Hou&s;e of Commons. But, the
longe&s;t and warm&s;t debates of this &s;e&s;&s;ion were produced
by a bill, which the Lords brought in, for abjuring the
pretended Prince of Wales, and &s;wearing to the King, by
title of rightful and lawful king, and his heirs, according
to the act of &s;ettlement. It was propo&s;ed, that this oath
&s;hould be voluntary, tendered to all per&s;ons, and their
&s;ub&s;cription or refu&s;al recorded without any other penalty.
This article was violently oppo&s;ed by the Earl of Not|tingham,
and other lords of the Tory-intere&s;t. They
ob&s;erved, that the government was fir&s;t &s;ettled with another
oath, which was like an original contract: &s;o that there
was no occa&s;ion for a new impo&s;ition: that oaths relating
to men's opinions had been always con&s;idered as &s;evere
impo&s;itions; and that a voluntary oath was in its own na|ture
unlawful. During the&s;e di&s;putes, another bill of
abjuration was brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons by Sir
Charles Hedges, that &s;hould be obligatory on all per&s;ons
who enjoyed employments in church or &s;tate; it likewi&s;e
included an obligation to maintain the government in
King, Lords, and Commons, and to maintain the church
of England, together with the toleration for di&s;&s;enters.
Warm debates aro&s;e upon the que&s;tion, Whether the oath
&s;hould be impo&s;ed or voluntary? and at length it was
caried for impo&s;ition, by the majority of one voice. They
agreed to in&s;ert an additional clau&s;e, declaring it equally
penal to compa&s;s or imagine the death of her Royal High|ne&s;s
the Prince&s;s Anne of Denmark, as it was to compa&s;s or
imagine the death of the King's elde&s;t &s;on and heir. In
the Hou&s;e of Peers this bill was &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by the
<PB N="403" REF="409">
Tories; and, when after long debates it pa&s;&s;ed on the
twenty-fourth day of February, ten Lords entered a pro|te&s;t
again&s;t it, as an unnece&s;&s;ary and &s;evere impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>&sect; LXVI. The whole nation now &s;eemed to join in
the cry for a war with France. Party heats began to
abate: the factions in the city of London were in great
mea&s;ure moderated by the union of the two companies
trading to the Ea&s;t-Indies, which found their mutual in|tere&s;t
required a coalition. The Tories in the Hou&s;e of
Commons having concurred &s;o heartily with the inclina|tions
of the people, re&s;olved, as far as it lay in their power,
to ju&s;tify the conduct of their party in the preceding par|liament.
They complained of &s;ome petitions and addre&s;|&s;es
which had reflected upon the proceedings of the la&s;t
Hou&s;e of Commons, and particularly of the Kenti&s;h pe|tition.
The majority, however, determined, that it was
the undoubted right of the people of England, to petition
or addre&s;s the King, for the calling, &s;itting, or di&s;&s;olving
of parliaments, and for the redre&s;&s;ing of grievances; and
that every &s;ubject under any accu&s;ation, either by impeach|ment
or otherwi&s;e, had a right to be brought to a &s;peedy
trial. A complaint being likewi&s;e made, that the Lords
had denied the Commons ju&s;tice in the matter of the late
impeachments, a furious debate en&s;ued; and it was carried
by a very &s;mall majority that ju&s;tice had not been denied.
In &s;ome points, however, they &s;ucceeded. In the ca&s;e of
a controverted election at Maid&s;tone, between Thomas
Bli&s;&s;e and Thomas Culpepper, the Hou&s;e re&s;olved, That
the latter had been not only guilty of corrupt, &s;candalous,
and in direct practices, in endeavouring to procure him&s;elf
to be elected a burge&s;s, but likewi&s;e, being one of the in|&s;truments
in promoting and pre&s;enting the &s;candalous,
in&s;olent, and &s;editious petition, commonly called the
Kenti&s;h petition, to the la&s;t Hou&s;e of Commons, was
guilty of promoting a &s;candalous, villainous, and ground|le&s;s
reflexion upon that Hou&s;e, by a&s;per&s;ing the members
with receiving French money, or being in the intere&s;t of
France; for which offence he was ordered to be commit|ted
<PB N="404" REF="410">
to Newgate, and to be pro&s;ecuted by his Maje&s;ty's
attorney-general. They al&s;o re&s;olved, That to a&s;&s;ert that
the Hou&s;e of Commons is not the only repre&s;entative of
the Commons of England tends to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the
rights and privileges of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and the
fundamental con&s;titution of the government of this king|dom:
That to a&s;&s;ert, that the Hou&s;e of Commons have
no power of commitment, but of their own members,
tends to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the con&s;titution of the Hou&s;e of
Commons: That to print or publi&s;h any books, or libels,
reflecting upon the proceedings of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons,
or any member thereof, for or relating to his &s;er|vice
therein, is a high violation of the rights and privi|leges
of the Hou&s;e of Commons. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e
tran&s;actions, they did not neglect the vigorous pro&s;ecution
of the war. They addre&s;&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to interpo&s;e with
his allies, that they might increa&s;e their quotas of land-forces,
to be put on board the fleet in proportion to the
numbers his Maje&s;ty &s;hould embark. When they had
&s;ettled the &s;ums appropriated to the &s;everal u&s;es of the war,
they pre&s;ented a &s;econd addre&s;s, de&s;iring he would provide
for the half-pay officers in the fir&s;t place, in the recruits
and levies to be made. The King a&s;&s;ured them it was
always his intention to provide for tho&s;e officers. He went
to the Hou&s;e of Peers and gave the royal a&s;&s;ent to an act,
appointing commi&s;&s;ioners to take, examine, and deter|mine
the debts due to the army, navy, and the tran&s;port
&s;ervice; and al&s;o to take an account of prizes taken during
the war.</P>
<P>&sect; LXVII. The affairs of Ireland were not a little em|barra&s;&s;ed
by the conduct of the tru&s;tees appointed to take
cognizance of the forfeited e&s;tates. Their office was ex|tremely
odious to the people, as well as to the court, and
their deportment was arbitrary and imperious. Several
individuals of that kingdom, provoked by the in&s;olence
of the tru&s;tees on one hand, and encouraged by the coun|tenance
of the courtiers on the other, endeavoured, by a
circular letter, to &s;pirit up the grand-jury of Ireland again&s;t
<PB N="405" REF="411">
the act of re&s;umption: petitions were pre&s;ented to the King,
couched in very &s;trong terms, affirming, that it was in|jurious
to the prote&s;tant intere&s;t, and had been obtained by
gro&s;s mi&s;informations. The King having communicated
the&s;e addre&s;&s;es to the Hou&s;e, they were immediately voted
&s;candalous, fal&s;e, and groundle&s;s: and the Commons re|&s;olved,
That, notwith&s;tanding the complaints and cla|mours
again&s;t the tru&s;tees, it did not appear to the Hou&s;e
but tho&s;e complaints were groundle&s;s: neverthele&s;s, they
afterwards received &s;everal petitions, imploring relief again&s;t
the &s;aid act; and they ordered that the petitioners &s;hould be
relieved accordingly. Propo&s;als were delivered in for in|corporating
&s;uch as &s;hould purcha&s;e the &s;aid forfeitures, on
certain terms therein &s;pecified, according to the rent-roll,
when verified and made good to the purcha&s;ers: but,
whereas in this rent-roll the value of the e&s;tates had been
e&s;timated at &s;omething more than &s;even hundred and &s;ix|teen
thou&s;and pounds, tho&s;e who undertook to make the
purcha&s;e affirmed they were not worth five hundred
thou&s;and pounds; and thus the affair remained in &s;u&s;|pen&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; LXVIII. With re&s;pect to Scotland, the clamours of
that kingdom had not yet &s;ub&s;ided. When the bill of
abjuration pa&s;&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Peers, the Earl of Not|tingham
had declared, that although he differed in opinion
from the majority in many particulars relating to that bill,
yet he was a friend to the de&s;ign of it; and, in order to
&s;ecure a prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he thought an union of the
whole i&s;land was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. He, therefore,
moved for an addre&s;s to the King, that he would di&s;&s;olve
the parliament of Scotland now &s;itting, as the legality of
it might be called in que&s;tion, on account of its having
been originally a convention; and that a new parliament
&s;hould be &s;ummoned, that they might treat about an union
of the two kingdoms. The King had this affair &s;o much
at heart, that even when he was di&s;abled from going to
the parliament in per&s;on, he &s;ent a letter to the Commons,
expre&s;&s;ing an eager de&s;ire that a treaty for this purpo&s;e
<PB N="406" REF="412">
might be &s;et on foot, and earne&s;tly recommending this
affair to the con&s;ideration of the Hou&s;e: but, as a new
parliament in Scotland could not be called without a
great ri&s;que, while the nation was in &s;uch a ferment, the
project was po&s;tponed to a more favourable opportunity.</P>
<P>&sect; LXIX. Before the King's return from Holland, he
had concerted with his allies the operations of the en&s;uing
campaign. He had engaged in a negociation with the
Prince of He&s;&s;e-D'Arm&s;tadt, who a&s;&s;ured him, that if he
would be&s;iege and take Cadiz, the Admiral of Ca&s;tile, and
divers other grandees of Spain, would declare for the
hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. The allies had al&s;o determined upon the
&s;iege of Keyfer&s;waert, which the Elector of Cologn had
delivered into the hands of the French: the Elector of
Hanover had re&s;olved to di&s;arm the Princes of Wolfen|buttle:
the King of the Romans, and Prince Louis of
Baden, undertook to inve&s;t Landau: and the Emperor
promi&s;ed to &s;end a powerful re-enforcement to Prince
Eugene in Italy: but William did not live to &s;ee the&s;e
&s;chemes put in execution. His con&s;titution was by this
time almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, though he endeavoured to conceal
the effects of his malady, and to repair his health by exer|ci&s;e.
On the twenty-fir&s;t day of February, in riding to
Hampton-court from Ken&s;ington, his Hor&s;e fell under
him, and he him&s;elf was thrown upon the ground with
&s;uch violence, as produced a fracture in his collar-bone.
His attendants conveyed him to the palace of Hampton|court,
where the fracture was reduced by Ronjat, his
&s;erjeant-&s;urgeon. In the evening he returned to Ken&s;ing|ton
in his coach, and the two ends of the fractured bone
having been di&s;united by the jolting of the carriage, were
replaced under the in&s;pection of Bidloo, his phy&s;ician. He
&s;eemed to be in a fair way of recovering till the fir&s;t day of
March, when his knee appeared to be inflamed, with great
pain and weakne&s;s. Next day he granted a commi&s;&s;ion
under the great &s;eal to &s;everal peers, for pa&s;&s;ing the bills
to which both Hou&s;es of Parliament had agreed, namely,
the act of attainder again&s;t the pretended Prince of Wales;
<PB N="407" REF="413">
and another in favour of the Quakers, enacting, That
their &s;olemn affirmation and declaration &s;hould be accepted
in&s;tead of an oath in the u&s;ual form.</P>
<P>&sect; LXX. On the fourth day of March the King was &s;o
well recovered of his lamene&s;s, that he took &s;everal turns
in the gallery at Ken&s;ington; but, &s;itting down on a
couch where he fell a&s;leep, he was &s;ei&s;ed with a &s;hivering,
which terminated in a fever and diarrhoea. He was at|tended
by Sir Thomas Millington, Sir Richard Black|more,
Sir Theodore Colledon, Dr. Bidloo, and other
eminent phy&s;icians; but their pre&s;criptions proved inef|fectual.
On the &s;ixth he granted another commi&s;&s;ion for
pa&s;&s;ing the bill for the malt-tax, and the act of abjuration;
and, being &s;o weak that he could not write his name, he,
in pre&s;ence of the Lord-keeper and the clerks of parliament,
applied a &s;tamp prepared for the purpo&s;e. The Earl of
Albemarle arriving from Holland, conferred with him in
private on the po&s;ture of affairs abroad: but he received
his informations with great coldne&s;s, and &s;aid, &startq;<HI>Je tire
vers ma fin.</HI>&mdash;I approach the end of my life.&endq; In the
evening he thanked Dr. Bidloo for his care and tenderne&s;s,
&s;aying, &startq;I know that you and the other learned phy&s;i|cians
have done all that your art can do for my relief;
but, finding all means ineffectual, I &s;ubmit.&endq; He
received &s;piritual con&s;olation from Archbi&s;hop $eni&s;on,
and Burnet Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury: on Sunday morning the
&s;acrament was admini&s;tered to him. The lords of the
privy-council, and divers noblemen attended in the ad|joining
apartments, and to &s;ome of them who were ad|mitted
he &s;poke a little. He thanked Lord Auverquerque
for his long and faithful &s;ervices: he delivered to Lord
Albemarle the keys of his clo&s;et and &s;crutore, telling him
he knew what to do with them. He enquired for the
Earl of Portland; but being &s;peechle&s;s before that no|bleman
arrived, he gra&s;ped his hand, and laid it to his
heart, with marks of the mo&s;t tender affection. On the
eighth day of March he expired, in the fifty-&s;econd year
of his age, after having reigned thirteen years. The
<PB N="408" REF="414">
Lords Lexington and Scarborough, who were in waiting,
no &s;ooner perceived the King was dead, than they or|dered
Ronjat to untie from his left arm a black ribbon,
to which was affixed a ring, containing &s;ome hair of the
late Queen Mary. The body being opened and embalmed,
lay in &s;tate for &s;ome time at Ken&s;ington; and on the
twelfth day of April was depo&s;ited in a vault of Henry's
chapel in We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey. In the beginning of May,
a will which he had entru&s;ted with Mon&s;ieur Schuylem|berg
was opened at the Hague. In this he had declared
his cou&s;in Prince Fri&s;on of Na&s;&s;au, Stadtholder of Frie&s;|land,
his &s;ole and univer&s;al heir, and appointed the States-General
his executors. By a codicil annexed, he had be|queathed
the lord&s;hip of Breevert, and a legacy of two
hundred thou&s;and guilders, to the Earl of Albemarle.</P>
<P>&sect; LXXI. William III. was in his per&s;on of the middle
&s;tatute, a thin body, and delicate con&s;titution, &s;ubject to
an a&s;thma and continual cough from his infancy. He had
an aquiline no&s;e, &s;parkling eyes, a large forehead, and a
grave &s;olemn a&s;pect. He was very &s;paring of &s;peech: his
conver&s;ation was dry, and his manner di&s;gu&s;ting, except
in battle, when his deportment was free, &s;pirited, and
animating. In courage, fortitude, and equanimity, he
rivalled the mo&s;t eminent warriors of antiquity; and his
natural &s;agacity made amends for the defects in his educa|tion,
which had not been properly &s;uperintended. He
was religious, temperate, generally ju&s;t and &s;incere, a
&s;tranger to violent tran&s;ports of pa&s;&s;ion, and might have
pa&s;&s;ed for one of the be&s;t princes of the age in which he
lived, had he never a&s;cended the throne of Great-Britain.
But the di&s;tingui&s;hing criterion of his character was am|bition.
To this he &s;acrificed the punctilios of honour
and decorum, in depo&s;ing his own father-in-law and uncle;
and this he gratified at the expen&s;e of the nation that
rai&s;ed him to &s;overeign authority. He a&s;pired to the ho|nour
of acting as umpire in all the conte&s;ts of Europe;
and the &s;econd object of his attention was, the pro&s;perity
of that country to which he owed his birth and extraction.
<PB N="409" REF="415">
Whether he really thought the intere&s;ts of the continent
and Great-Britain were in&s;eparable, or &s;ought only to
drag England into the confederacy as a convenient ally,
certain it is, he involved the&s;e kingdoms in foreign con|nexions,
which, in all probability, will be productive of
their ruin. In order to e&s;tabli&s;h this favourite point, he
&s;crupled not to employ all the engines of corruption, by
which the morals of the nation were totally debauched.
He procured a parliamentary &s;anction for a &s;tanding ar|my,
which now &s;eems to be interwoven in the con&s;tituti|on.
He introduced the pernicious practice of borrowing
upon remote funds; an expedient that nece&s;&s;arily hatch|ed
a brood of u&s;urers, brokers, contractors, and &s;tock
jobbers, to prey upon the vitals of their country. He en|tailed
upon the nation a growing debt, and a &s;y&s;tem of
politicks big with mi&s;ery, de&s;pair, and de&s;truction. To
&s;um up his character in a few words&mdash;William was a fa|tali&s;t
in religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Oldmixton. Boyer. Lamberty. State Tracts Tindal. Ralph. Voltaire.</NOTE> indefatigable in war, enterpri&s;ing in po|liticks,
dead to all the warm and generous emotions of
the human heart, a cold relation, an indifferent hu&s;band,
a di&s;agreeable man, an ungracious prince, and an imperi|pus

&sect; 1. WILLIAM was &s;ucceeded as &s;overeign of
England by Anne Prince&s;s of Denmark,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VII. 1701.</NOTE>
who a&s;cended the throne in the thirty-eighth year of her
age, to the general &s;atisfaction of all parties. Even the
Jacobites &s;eemed plea&s;ed with her elevation, on the &s;up|po&s;ition,
that as in all probability &s;he would leave no heirs
of her own body, the dictates of natural affection would
induce her to alter the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in favour of her own
brother. She had been taught to cheri&s;h warm &s;enti|ments
of the Tories, whom &s;he con&s;idered as the friends
of monarchy, and the true &s;ons of the church; and they
had always profe&s;&s;ed an inviolable attachment to her per|&s;on
and intere&s;t: but her conduct was wholly influenced
by the Counte&s;s of Marlborough, a woman of an imperi|ous
temper and intriguing genius, who had been intimate
with the Prince&s;s from her tender years, and gained a
&s;urpri&s;ing a&s;cendency over her. Anne had undergone
&s;ome &s;trange vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune in con&s;equence of her
father's expul&s;ion, and &s;u&s;tained a variety of mortificati|ons
in the late reign, during which &s;he conducted her&s;elf
with &s;uch di&s;cretion, as left little or no pretence for
cen&s;ure or re&s;entment. Such conduct, indeed, was in a
<PB N="412" REF="418">
great mea&s;ure owing to a natural temperance of di&s;po&s;iti|on,
not ea&s;ily ruffled or inflamed. She was zealou&s;ly de|voted
to the church of England, from which her father
had u&s;ed &s;ome endeavours to detach her before the Revo|lution;
and &s;he lived in great harmony with her hu&s;band,
to whom &s;he bore &s;ix children, all of whom &s;he had al|ready
&s;urvived. William had no &s;ooner yielded up his
breath, than the privy-council in a body waited on the new
Queen, who, in a &s;hort but &s;en&s;ible &s;peech, a&s;&s;ured them,
that no pains nor diligence &s;hould be wanting on her part,
to pre&s;erve and &s;upport the religion, laws, and liberties
of her country, to maintain the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the prote&s;tant
line, and the government in church and &s;tate, as by law
e&s;tabli&s;hed. She declared her re&s;olution to carry on the
preparations for oppo&s;ing the exorbitant powers of France,
and to a&s;&s;ure the allies, that &s;he would pur&s;ue the true in|tere&s;t
of England, together with their's, for the &s;upport
of the common cau&s;e. The members of the privy-council
having taken the oaths, &s;he ordered a proclamation to be
publi&s;hed, &s;ignifying her plea&s;ure, that all per&s;ons in of|fice
of authority or government, at the decea&s;e of the
late King, &s;hould &s;o continue till further directions. By
virtue of an act pa&s;&s;ed in the late reign, the parliament
continued &s;itting even after the King's death. Both
Hou&s;es met immediately, and unanimou&s;ly voted an ad|dre&s;s
of condolance and congratulation; and, in the after|noon,
the Queen was proclaimed. Next day the Lords
and Commons &s;everally attended her with an addre&s;s, con|gratulating
her Maje&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne; and,
a&s;&s;uring her of their firm re&s;olution to &s;upport her again&s;t
all her enemies what&s;oever. The Lords acknowledged,
that their great lo&s;s was no otherwi&s;e to be repaired but
by a vigorous adherence to her Maje&s;ty and her allies, in
the pro&s;ecution of tho&s;e mea&s;ures already concerted to re+duce
the exorbitant power of France. The Commons
declared, they would maintain the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown
in the prote&s;tant line, and effectually provide for the pub|lick
credit of the nation. The&s;e addre&s;&s;es were graciou&s;ly
<PB N="413" REF="419">
received by the Queen, who, on the eleventh day of
March, went to the Hou&s;e of Peers with the u&s;ual &s;o|lemnity,
where, in a &s;peech to both Hou&s;es, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed
her &s;atisfaction at their unanimous concurrence with her
opinion, that too much could not be done for the encou|ragement
of their allies in humbling the power of France;
and, de&s;ired they would con&s;ider of proper methods to|wards
obtaining an union between England and Scotland.
She ob&s;erved to the Commons, that the revenue for de|fraying
the expen&s;es of the civil government was expired;
and that &s;he relied entirely on their affection for its being
&s;upplied in &s;uch a manner as &s;hould be mo&s;t &s;uitable to
the honour and dignity of the crown. She declared it
&s;hould be her con&s;tant endeavour to make them the be&s;t
return for their duty and affection, by a careful and dili|gent
admini&s;tration for the good of all her &s;ubjects. &startq;And
as I know my own heart to be entirely Engli&s;h (con|tinued
&s;he) I can very &s;incerely a&s;&s;ure you, there is
not any thing you can expect or de&s;ire from me, which
I &s;hall not be ready to do for the happine&s;s and pro&s;pe|rity
of England; and you &s;hall always find me a &s;trict
and religious ob&s;erver of my word.&endq; The&s;e a&s;&s;urances
were extremely agreeable to the parliament; and &s;he re|ceived
the thanks of both Hou&s;es. Addre&s;&s;es of congra|tulation
were pre&s;ented by the bi&s;hop and clergy of Lon|don;
by the di&s;&s;enters in and about that city; and, by all
the counties, cities, towns, and corporations of England.
She declared her attachment to the church: &s;he promi&s;ed
her protection to the di&s;&s;enters; and received the com|pliments
of all her &s;ubjects with &s;uch affability as in&s;ured
their affection.</P>
<P>&sect; II. William's death was no &s;ooner known at the
Hague, than all Holland was filled with con&s;ternation.
The States immediately a&s;&s;embled, and, for &s;ome time,
gazed at each other in &s;ilent fear and a&s;toni&s;hment. They
&s;ighed, wept, and interchanged embraces and vows, that
they would act with unanimity, and expend their deare&s;t
blood in defence of their country. Then they di&s;patched
<PB N="414" REF="420">
letters to the cities and provinces, informing them of this
unfortunate event, and exhorting them to union and per|&s;everance.
The expre&s;s from England having brought
the Queen's &s;peech to her privy-council, it was tran&s;lated
and publi&s;hed, to revive the drooping &s;pirits of the people.
Next day Pen&s;ionary Fagel imparted to the States of Hol|land
a letter which he had received from the Earl of
Marlborough, containing a&s;&s;urances, in the Queen's name,
of union and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In a few days, the Queen wrote
a letter in the French language to the States, confirming
the&s;e a&s;&s;urances: it was delivered by Mr. Stanhope, whom
&s;he had furni&s;hed with fre&s;h credentials as envoy from
England. Thus animated, the States re&s;olved to pro&s;e|cute
vigorous mea&s;ures: their re&s;olutions were &s;till more
in&s;pirited by the arrival of the Earl of Marlborough,
whom the Queen honoured with the order of the garter,
and inve&s;ted with the character of amba&s;&s;ador extraordi|nary
and plenipotentiary to the States-General: he was
likewi&s;e declared captain-general of her forces both at
home and abroad. He a&s;&s;ured the States, that her Bri|tannick
Maje&s;ty would maintain the alliances which had
been concluded by the late King, and do every thing that
the common concerns of Europe required. The &s;peech
was an&s;wered by Dickvelt, pre&s;ident of the week, who,
in the name of the States, expre&s;&s;ed their hearty thanks
to her Maje&s;ty, and their re&s;olution of concurring with
her in a vigorous pro&s;ecution of the common intere&s;t.</P>
<P>&sect; III. The importance of William's life was evinced
by the joy that diffu&s;ed it&s;elf through the kingdom of
France at the news of his decea&s;e. The per&s;on who fir&s;t
brought the tidings to Calais was impri&s;oned by the gover|nor,
until his information was confirmed. The court of
Ver&s;ailles could hardly re&s;train their tran&s;ports &s;o as to
pre&s;erve common decorum: the people of Paris openly
rejoiced at the event: all decency was laid a&s;ide at Rome,
where this incident produced &s;uch indecent raptures, that
Cardinal Grimani, the Imperial mini&s;ter, complained of
them to the Pope, as an in&s;ult on his ma&s;ter the Emperor,
<PB N="415" REF="421">
who was William's friend,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. V. 1701.</NOTE> confederate, and ally. The
French King di&s;patched credentials to Barre, whom the
Count D'Avaux had left at the Hague to manage the
affairs of France, together with in&s;tructions to renew the
negociation with the States, in hope of detaching them
from the alliance. This mini&s;ter pre&s;ented a memorial,
implying &s;evere reflexions on King William, and the pa&s;t
conduct of the Dutch; and in&s;inuating, that now they had
recovered their liberty, the court of France hoped they
would con&s;ult their true intere&s;t. The Count de Goes,
envoy from the Emperor, animadverted on the&s;e expre&s;|&s;ions
in another memorial, which was likewi&s;e publi&s;hed:
the States produced in publick an an&s;wer to the &s;ame re|mon&s;trance,
expre&s;&s;ing their re&s;entment at the in&s;olence
of &s;uch in&s;inuations, and their veneration for the memory
of their late Stadtholder. The Earl of Marlborough
&s;ucceeded in every part of his negociation. He anima|ted
the Dutch to a full exertion of their vigour: he con|certed
the operations of the campaign: he agreed with
the States-General and the Imperial mini&s;ter, that war
&s;hould be declared again&s;t France on the &s;ame day, at
Vienna, London, and the Hague; and on the third of April
embarked for England, after having acquired the entire
confidence of tho&s;e who governed the United Provinces.</P>
<P>&sect; IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1702.</NOTE> By this time the Hou&s;e of Commons in England
had &s;ettled the civil li&s;t upon the Queen for her life. When
the bill received the royal a&s;&s;ent, &s;he a&s;&s;ured them, that one
hundred thou&s;and pounds of this revenue &s;hould be applied
to the publick &s;ervice of the current year: at the &s;ame
time, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed another bill, for receiving and examining
the publick accounts. A commi&s;&s;ion for this purpo&s;e was
granted in the preceding reign, but had been for &s;ome years
di&s;continued; and, indeed, always proved ineffectual to
detect and puni&s;h tho&s;e individuals who &s;hamefully pil|laged
their country. The villainy was &s;o complicated, the
vice &s;o general, and the delinquent &s;o powerfully &s;creened
by artifice and intere&s;t, as to elude all enquiry. On the
twenty-fourth day of March the oath of abjuration was
<PB N="416" REF="422">
taken by the Speaker and members, according to an a$
for the further &s;ecurity of her Maje&s;ty's per&s;on, and th$
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown in the prote&s;tant line, and for ex$tingui&s;hing
the hopes of the pretended Prince of Wales&punc;
The Queen's inclination to the Tories plainly appeare$
in her choice of mini&s;ters. Doctor John Sharp, Archbi&s;hop
of York, became her gho&s;tly director and coun&s;ellor in al$
eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. The Earl of Roche&s;ter was conti|nued
Lord-lieutenant of Ireland, and enjoyed a great &s;hare
of her Maje&s;ty's confidence: the privy-&s;eal was entru&s;ted
to the Marquis of Normandy: the Earl of Nottingham
and Sir Charles Hedges were appointed Secretaries o$
State: the Earl of Abingdon, Vi&s;count Weymouth, Lord
Dartmouth, Sir Chri&s;topher Mu&s;grave, Grenville, Howe,
Gower, and Harcourt, were admitted as members of the
privy-council, together with Sir Edward Seymour, now
declared comptroller of the hou&s;ehold. The Lord Godol|phin
declined accepting the office of lord high-trea&s;urer,
until he was over-ruled by the per&s;ua&s;ions of Marl|borough,
to who&s;e elde&s;t daughter his &s;on was married.
This nobleman refu&s;ed to command the forces abroad,
unle&s;s the Trea&s;ury &s;hould be put into the hands of Godol|phin,
on who&s;e punctuality in point of remittances
he knew he could depend. George Prince of Denmark,
was inve&s;ted with the title of generali&s;&s;imo of all the Queen's
forces by &s;ea and land; and afterwards created lord high
admiral, the Earl of Pembroke having been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
from this office with the offer of a large pen&s;ion, which he
generou&s;ly refu&s;ed. Prince George, as admiral, was
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a council, con&s;i&s;ting of Sir George Rooke, Sir
David Mitchel, George Churchill, and Richard Hill$
Though the legality of this board was doubted, the par|liament
had &s;uch re&s;pect and veneration for the Queen,
that it was &s;uffered to act without que&s;tion.</P>
<P>&sect; V. A rival&s;hip for the Queen's favour already appear|ed
between the Earls of Roche&s;ter and Marlborough. The
former, as fir&s;t cou&s;in to the Queen, and chief of the Tory|faction,
maintained con&s;iderable influence in the council $word$
<PB N="417" REF="423">
but even there the intere&s;t of his rival predominated.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VII. 1702.</NOTE>
Marlborough was not only the better courtier, but, by
the canal of his counte&s;s, actually directed the Queen in
all her re&s;olutions. Roche&s;ter propo&s;ed in council, that
the Engli&s;h &s;hould avoid a declaration of war with France,
and act as auxiliaries only. He was &s;econded by &s;ome
other members: but the opinion of Marlborough pre|ponderated.
He ob&s;erved, that the honour of the nation
was concerned to fulfil the late King's engagements; and
affirmed that France could never be reduced within due
bounds, unle&s;s the Engli&s;h would enter as principals in the
quarrel. This allegation was &s;upported by the Dukes of
Somer&s;et and Devon&s;hire, the Earl of Pembroke, and the
majority of the council. The Queen being re&s;olved to
declare war, communicated her intention to the Hou&s;e of
Commons, by whom it was approved; and on the fourth
day of May the declaration was &s;olemnly proclaimed.
The King of France was, in this proclamation, taxed
with having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of great part of the Spani&s;h
dominions; with de&s;igning to invade the liberties of Eu|rope,
and ob&s;truct the freedom of navigation and com|merce;
with having offered an unpardonable in&s;ult to
the Queen and her throne, by taking upon him to declare
the pretended Prince of Wales King of England, Scot|land,
and Ireland. The three declarations of the Em|peror,
England, and the States-General, which were
publi&s;hed in one day, did not fail to di&s;concert, as well as
to provoke, the French monarch. When his mini&s;ter De
Torcy recited them in his hearing, he &s;poke of the Queen
with &s;ome acrimony; but with re&s;pect to the States-Ge|neral,
he declared with great emotion, that &startq;Me&s;&s;ieurs
the Dutch merchants &s;hould one day repent of their in|&s;olence
and pre&s;umption, in declaring war again&s;t &s;o
powerful a monarch:&endq; he did not, however, produce
his declaration till the third day of July.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. The Hou&s;e of Commons, in compliance with the
Queen's de&s;ire, brought in a bill, empowering her Ma|je&s;ty
to name commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the Scots for an
<PB N="418" REF="424">
union of the two kingdoms.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1702.</NOTE> It met with warm oppo|&s;ition
from Sir Edward Seymour, and other Tory mem|bers,
who di&s;charged abundance of &s;atire and ridicule upon
the Scotti&s;h nation: but the mea&s;ure &s;eemed &s;o nece&s;&s;ary at
that juncture, to &s;ecure the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion again&s;t
the practices of France, and the claims of the Pretender,
that the majority e&s;pou&s;ed the bill, which pa&s;&s;ed through
both Hou&s;es, and on the &s;ixth day of May received the
royal a&s;&s;ent, together with &s;ome bills of le&s;s importance.
The enemies of the late King continued to revile his
memory.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In their hour$ of debauch, they drank to the health of Sor$el, meaning the hof&s;e that &s;ell with the King; and, under the appellation of the little gentleman in velvet, $oa&s;ted the mole that rai&s;ed the hill over which the hor&s;e had &s;lumbled. As the bea&s;t had formerly belonged to Sir John Fenwick, they in&s;inuated that William's fate was a judgement upon him, for his cruelty to that gentleman; and a Latin epigram was written on the occa&s;ion.</NOTE> They even charged him with having formed
a de&s;ign of excluding the Prince&s;s Anne from the throne,
and of introducing the Elector of Hanover as his own
immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or. This report had been &s;o in|du&s;triou&s;ly
circulated, that it began to gain credit
all over the kingdom. Several Peers intere&s;ted them|&s;elves
in William's character; and a motion was made
in the Upper Hou&s;e, that the truth of this report &s;hould
be enquired into. The Hou&s;e immediately de&s;ired that
tho&s;e Lords who had vi&s;ited the late King's papers
would intimate whether or not they had found any among
them relating to the Queen's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, or to the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
of the hou&s;e of Hanover. They forthwith declared,
that nothing of that &s;ort appeared. Then the Hou&s;e re|&s;olved,
That the report was groundle&s;s, fal&s;e, villainous,
and &s;candalous, to the di&s;honour of the late King's me|mory,
and highly tending to the di&s;&s;ervice of her pre&s;ent
Maje&s;ty, whom they be&s;ought to give order that the authors
or publi&s;hers of &s;uch &s;candalous reports &s;hould be pro&s;e|cuted
by the Attorney-General. The &s;ame cen&s;ure was
pa&s;&s;ed upon &s;ome libels, and pamphlets, tending to inflame
the factions of the kingdom, and to propagate a &s;pirit of

On the twenty-fir&s;t day of May, the Com|mons,

<P>&sect; VII. In Scotland, a warm conte&s;t aro&s;e between the
Revolutioners and tho&s;e in the oppo&s;ition, concerning the
exi&s;tence of the pre&s;ent parliament. The Queen had &s;ig|nified
her acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, in a letter to her privy-council
for Scotland, de&s;iring they would continue to act
in that office, until &s;he &s;hould &s;end a new commi&s;&s;ion.
Mean while &s;he authori&s;ed them to publi&s;h a proclamation,
ordaining all officers of &s;tate, coun&s;ellors, and magi&s;trates,
<PB N="420" REF="426">
to act in all things conformably to the commi&s;&s;ions and
in&s;tructions of his late Maje&s;ty, until new commi&s;&s;ions
&s;hould be prepared. She likewi&s;e a&s;&s;ured them of her firm
re&s;olution to protect them in their religion, laws, and li|berties,
and in the e&s;tabli&s;hed government of the church.
She had already, in pre&s;ence of twelve Scotti&s;h coun&s;el|lors,
taken the coronation-oath for that kingdom: but
tho&s;e who wanted to embroil the affairs of their country
affirmed, that this was an irregular way of proceeding, and
that the oath ought to have been tendered by per&s;ons de|puted
for that purpo&s;e, either by the parliament, or the
privy-council of the kingdom. The pre&s;ent mini&s;try,
con&s;i&s;ting of the Duke of Queen&s;berry, the Earls of March|mont,
Melvil, Seafield, Hyndford, and Selkirk, were de|voted
to Revolution principles, and de&s;irous that the par|liament
&s;hould continue in pur&s;uance of a late act for con|tinuing
the Parliament that &s;hould be then in being, &s;ix
months after the death of the King; and that it &s;hould
a&s;&s;emble in twenty days after that event. The Queen had,
by &s;everal adjournments, deferred the meeting almo&s;t three
months after the King's decea&s;e; and, therefore, the anti-revolutioners
affirmed that it was di&s;&s;olved. The Duke
of Hamilton was at the head of this party, which cla|moured
loudly for a new parliament. This noblemen,
together with the Marquis of Tweedale, the Earls Mar|&s;hal
and Rothes, and many other nobleman, repaired to
London, in order to make the Queen acquainted with their
objections to the continuance of the pre&s;ent parliament.
She admitted them to her pre&s;ence, and calmly heard their
allegations: but &s;he was determined, by the advice of her
privy-council for that kingdom, who were of opinion that
the nation was in too great a ferment to hazard the con|vocation
of a new parliament. According to the Queen's
la&s;t adjournment, the parliament met at Edinburgh on the
ninth day of June, the Duke of Queen&s;berry having been
appointed high-commi&s;&s;ioner. Before the Queen's com|mi&s;&s;ion
was read, the Duke of Hamilton, for him&s;elf and
his adherents, declared their &s;atisfaction at her Maje&s;ty's
<PB N="421" REF="427">
acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, not only on account of her un|doubted
right by de&s;cent, but likewi&s;e becau&s;e of her ma|ny
per&s;onal virtues and royal qualities. He &s;aid they were
re&s;olved to &s;acrifice their lives and fortunes in defence of
her Maje&s;ty's right again&s;t all her enemies whatever; but
at the &s;ame time, they thought them&s;elves bound in duty
to give their opinion, that they were not warranted by law
to &s;it and act as a parliament. He then read a paper to the
following effect: That fora&s;much as, by the fundamental
laws and con&s;titution of this kingdom, all parliaments do
di&s;&s;olve on the death of the &s;overeign, except in &s;o far as
innovated by an act in the preceding reign, that the par|liament
in being at his Maje&s;ty's decea&s;e &s;hould meet, and
act what might be needful for the defence of the true pro|te&s;tant
religion, as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed; and for the main|tenance
of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, as &s;ettled by the
claim of right; and for the pre&s;ervation and &s;ecurity of
the publick peace: and &s;eeing the&s;e ends are fully an&s;wered
by her Maje&s;ty's &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne, we conceive
our&s;elves not now warranted by law to meet, &s;it, or act;
and, therefore, do di&s;&s;ent from anything that &s;hall be done
or acted. The Duke having recited this paper, and for|mally
prote&s;ted again&s;t the proceedings of the parliament,
withdrew with &s;eventy-nine members, amid&s;t the accla|mations
of the people.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. Notwith&s;tanding their &s;ece&s;&s;ion, their commi&s;|&s;ioner,
who retained a much greater number, produced
the Queen's letter, &s;ignifying her re&s;olution to maintain
and protect her &s;ubjects in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their re|ligion,
laws, liberties, and the pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline.
She informed them of her having declared war again&s;t
France: &s;he exhorted them to provide competent &s;upplies
for maintaining &s;uch a number of forces as might be nece&s;|&s;ary
for di&s;appointing the enemy's de&s;igns, and pre&s;erving
the pre&s;ent happy &s;ettlement; and &s;he earne&s;tly recom|mended
to their con&s;ideration an union of the two king|doms.
The Duke of Queen&s;berry and the Earl of March|mont
having enforced the different articles of this letter,
<PB N="422" REF="428">
committees were appointed for the &s;ecurity of the kingdom,
for controverted elections, for drawing up an an&s;wer to her
Maje&s;ty's letter, and for revi&s;ing the minutes. Meanwhile,
the Duke of Hamilton and his adherents &s;ent the Lord
Blantyre to London, with an addre&s;s to the Queen, who
refu&s;ed to receive it, but wrote another letter to the par|liament,
expre&s;&s;ing her re&s;olution to maintain their digni|ty
and authority again&s;t all oppo&s;ers. They, in an&s;wer to
the former, had a&s;&s;ured her, that the groundle&s;s &s;ece&s;&s;ion
of &s;ome members &s;hould increa&s;e and &s;trengthen their
care and zeal for her Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. They expelled Sir
Alexander Bruce, for having given vent to &s;ome reflections
again&s;t Pre&s;bytery. The Lord Advocate pro&s;ecuted the
faculty of advocates before the parliament, for having
pa&s;&s;ed a vote among them&s;elves in favour of the prote&s;ta|tion
and addre&s;s of the di&s;&s;enting members. The faculty
was &s;everely reprimanded: but the whole nation &s;eemed
to re&s;ent the pro&s;ecution. The parliament pa&s;&s;ed an act for
recognizing her Maje&s;ty's royal authority: another for ad|journing
the court of judicature called the &s;e&s;&s;ion: a third
for declaring this meeting of parliament legal: and for|bidding
any per&s;on to di&s;own, quarrel, or impugn, the
dignity and authority thereof, under the penalty of high
trea&s;on: a fourth for &s;ecuring the true prote&s;tant religion
and pre&s;byterian church government: a fifth for a land
tax: and a &s;ixth enabling her Maje&s;ty to appoint commi&s;|&s;ioners
for an union between the two kingdoms.</P>
<P>&sect; IX. The Earl of Marchmont, of his own accord, and
even contrary to the advice of the high-commi&s;&s;ioner,
brought in a bill for abjuring the pretended Prince of Wales:
but this was not &s;upported by the court-party, as the com|mi&s;&s;ioner
had no in&s;tructions how to act on the occa&s;ion.
Perhaps the Queen and her Engli&s;h mini&s;try re&s;olved to
keep the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion open in Scotland, as a check upon the
Whigs and hou&s;e of Hanover. On the thirtieth day of
June, the commi&s;&s;ioner adjourned the parliament, after
having thanked them for their chearfulne&s;s and unanimity
in their proceedings; and the chiefs of the oppo&s;ite parties
<PB N="423" REF="429">
ha&s;tened to London, to make their different repre&s;entations
to the Queen and her mini&s;try. In the mean time, &s;he
appointed commi&s;&s;ioners for treating about the union; and
they met at the cockpit on the twenty-&s;econd day of
October. On the twentieth day of the next month, they
adju&s;ted preliminaries, importing, That nothing agreed on
among them&s;elves &s;hould be binding, except ratified by
her Maje&s;ty and the re&s;pective parliaments of both nations;
and that, unle&s;s all the heads propo&s;ed for the treaty were
agreed to, no particular thing agreed on &s;hould be binding.
The Queen vi&s;ited them in December, in order to quicken
their mutual endeavours. They agreed, that the two
kingdoms &s;hould be in&s;eparably united into one monarchy,
under her Maje&s;ty, her heirs, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and under
the &s;ame limitations, according to the acts of &s;ettlement:
but, when the Scotti&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners propo&s;ed that the
rights and privileges of their company trading to Africa and
the Indies &s;hould be pre&s;erved and maintained, &s;uch a
difficulty aro&s;e as could not be &s;urmounted, and no further
progre&s;s was made in this commi&s;&s;ion. The tranquillity of
Ireland was not interrupted by any new commotion. That
kingdom was ruled by ju&s;tices whom the Earl of Roche&s;|ter
had appointed; and the tru&s;tees for the forfeited e&s;tates
maintained their authority.</P>
<P>&sect; X. While Britain was engaged in the&s;e civil tran&s;|actions,
her allies were not idle on the continent. The
old Duke of Zell, and his nephew, the Elector of Brun&s;|wick,
&s;urpri&s;ed the Dukes of Wolfenbuttle and Saxe-Gotha,
whom they compelled to renounce their attach|ments
to France, and concur in the common councils of
the empire. Thus the north of Germany was re-united
in the intere&s;t of the confederates; and the princes would
have been in a condition to a&s;&s;i&s;t them effectually, had
not the neighbourhood of the war in Poland deterred
them from parting with their forces. England and the
States-General endeavoured in vain to mediate a peace
between the Kings of Sweden and Poland. Charles was
become enamoured of war, and ambitious of conque&s;t.
<PB N="424" REF="430">
He threatened to invade Saxony through the dominions
of Pru&s;&s;ia. Augu&s;tus retired to Cracow, while Charles
penetrated to War&s;aw, and even ordered the Cardinal|primate
to &s;ummon a diet for choo&s;ing a new king. The
&s;ituation of affairs, at this juncture, was far from being
favourable to the allies. The court of Vienna had tam|pered
in vain with the Elector of Bavaria, who made u&s;e
of this negociation to rai&s;e his terms with Louis. His
brother, the Elector of Cologn, admitted French garri|&s;ons
into Liege, and all his places on the Rhine. The
Elector of Saxony was too hard pre&s;&s;ed by the King of
Sweden, to &s;pare his full proportion of troops to the allies:
the King of Pru&s;&s;ia was over-awed by the vicinity of the
Swedi&s;h conqueror: the Duke of Savoy had joined his
forces to tho&s;e of France, and over-run the whole &s;tate
of Milan; and the Pope, though he profe&s;&s;ed a neutrality,
evinced him&s;elf &s;trongly bia&s;&s;ed to the French intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. The war was begun in the name of the Elector
Palatine with the &s;iege of Kei&s;er&s;waert, which was in|ve&s;ted
in the month of April by the Prince of Na&s;&s;au-Saarbrugh,
mare&s;chal-du-camp to the Emperor: under
this officer the Dutch troops &s;erved as auxiliaries, becau&s;e
war had not yet been declared by the States-General.
The French garri&s;on made a de&s;perate defence. They
wor&s;ted the be&s;iegers in divers &s;allies, and maintained the
place until it was reduced to a heap of a&s;hes. At length
the allies made a general attack upon the counter&s;carp
and ravelin, which they carried after a very ob&s;tinate en|gagement,
with the lo&s;s of two thou&s;and men. Then
the garri&s;on capitulated on honourable terms, and
the fortifications were razed. During this &s;iege, which
la&s;ted from the eighteenth day of April to the middle of
June, Count Tallard po&s;ted him&s;elf on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of
the Rhine, from whence he &s;upplied the town with fre&s;h
troops and ammunition, and annoyed the be&s;iegers with
his artillery: but finding it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ave the place,
he joined the grand army, commanded by the Duke of
Burgundy in the Netherlands. The &s;iege of Kei&s;er&s;waert
<PB N="425" REF="431">
was covered by a body of Dutch troops under the Earl of
Athlone, who lay encamped in the duchy of Cleve. Mean
while General Coehorn, at the head of another detach|ment,
entered Flanders, demoli&s;hed the French lines be|tween
the forts of Donat and I&s;abella, and laid the cha|tellanie
of Bruges under contribution: but a con&s;iderable
body of French troops advancing under the Marquis de
Bedmar, and the Count de la Motte, he overflowed the
country, and retired under the walls of Sluys. The Duke
of Burgundy, who had taken the command of the French
army under Boufflers, encamped at Zanten, near Cleve,
and laid a &s;cheme for &s;urpri&s;ing Nimeguen; in which,
however, he was baffled by the vigilance and activity of
Athlone, who, gue&s;&s;ing his de&s;ign, marched thither and
encamped under the cannon of the town. In the begin|ning
of June, Landau was inve&s;ted by Prince Louis of
Baden: in July, the King of the Romans arrived in the
camp of the be&s;iegers, with &s;uch pomp and magnificence
as exhau&s;ted his father's trea&s;ury. On the ninth day of
September, the citadel was taken by a&s;&s;ault; and then the
town &s;urrendered.</P>
<P>&sect; XII. When the Earl of Marlborough arrived in Hol|land,
the Earl of Athlone, in quality of veldt-mare&s;chal,
in&s;i&s;ted upon an equal command with the Engli&s;h gene|ral:
but the States obliged him to yield this point in favour
of Marlborough, whom they declared generali&s;&s;imo of all
their forces. In the beginning of July he repaired to the
camp at Nimeguen, where he &s;oon a&s;&s;embled an army of
&s;ixty thou&s;and men, well provided with all nece&s;&s;aries;
then he convoked a council of the general officers, to con|cert
the operations of the campaign. On the &s;ixteenth
day of the month he pa&s;&s;ed the Mae&s;e, and encamped at
Over-a&s;&s;elt, within two leagues and a half of the enemy,
who had entrenched them&s;elves between Goch and Genap.
He afterwards repa&s;&s;ed the river below the Grave, and re|moved
to Gravenbroc$k, where he was joined by the
Briti&s;h train of artillery from Holland. On the &s;econd
day of Augu&s;t, he advanced to Petit Brugel, and the
<PB N="426" REF="432">
French retired before him, leaving Spani&s;h Guelderland
to his di&s;cretion. He had re&s;olved to hazard an engage|ment,
and i&s;&s;ued orders accordingly: but he was re&s;train|ed
by the Dutch deputies, who were afraid of their own
intere&s;t, in ca&s;e the battle &s;hould have proved unfortunate.
The Duke of Burgundy finding him&s;elf obliged to retreat
before the allied army, rather than expo&s;e him&s;elf longer
to &s;uch a mortifying indignity, returned to Ver&s;ailles,
leaving the command to Boufflers, who lo&s;t the confi|dence
of Louis by the ill-&s;ucce&s;s of this campaign. The
deputies of the States-General having repre&s;ented to the
Earl of Marlborough the advantages that would accrue
to Holland, from his di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the enemy of the places
they maintained in the Spani&s;h Guelderland, by which the
navigation of the Mae&s;e was ob&s;tructed, and the impor|tant
town of Mae&s;tricht in a manner blocked up, he re|&s;olved
to deliver them from &s;uch a trouble&s;ome neigh|bourhood.
He detached General Schultz with a body of
troops to reduce the town and ca&s;tle of Werk, which were
&s;urrendered after a &s;light re&s;i&s;tance. In the beginning of
September, he undertook the &s;iege of Venlo, which capi|tulated
on the twenty-fifth day of the month, after fort
St. Michael had been &s;tormed and taken by Lord Cutts
and the Engli&s;h volunteers, among whom the young Earl
of Huntingdon di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by very extraordinary
acts of valour. Then the General inve&s;ted Ruremonde,
which he reduced after a very ob&s;tinate defence, together
with the fort of Steven&s;uaert, &s;ituated on the &s;ame river.
Bouf&s;lers, confounded at the rapidity of Marlborough's
&s;ucce&s;s, retired towards Liege, in order to cover that city:
but, at the approach of the confederates, he retired with
precipitation to Tongeren, from whence he directed his
route towards Brabant, with a view to defend &s;uch places
as the allies had no de&s;ign to attack. When the Earl of
Marlborough arrived at Liege, he found the &s;uburbs of St.
Walburgh had been &s;et on fire by the French garri&s;on,
who had retired into the citadel and the Chartreux The
allies took immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city; and in a few
<PB N="427" REF="433">
days opened the trenches again&s;t the citadel, which was
taken by a&s;&s;ault. On this occa&s;ion, the Hereditary Prince
of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el charged the head of the grenadiers, and
was the fir&s;t per&s;on who mounted the breach. Violani
the governor, and the Duke of Charo&s;t, were made pri&s;o|ners.
Three hundred thou&s;and florins in gold and &s;ilver
were found in the citadel, be&s;ides notes for above one
million, drawn upon &s;ub&s;tantial merchants in Liege,
who paid the money. Immediately after this exploit, the
garri&s;on of the Chartreux capitulated on honourable
terms, and were conducted to Antwerp. By the &s;ucce&s;s
of this campaign, the Earl of Marlborough rai&s;ed his mi|litary
character above all cen&s;ure, and confirmed him&s;elf
in the entire confidence of the States-General, who, in the
beginning of the &s;ea&s;on, had trembled for Nimeguen, and
now &s;aw the enemy driven back into their own domains.</P>
<P>&sect; XIII. When the army broke up in November, the
General repaired to Mae&s;tricht, from whence he propo&s;ed
to return to the Hague by water. Accordingly, he em|barked
in a large boat, with five-and-twenty &s;oldiers,
under the command of a lieutenant. Next morning he
was joined at Ruremonde by Cochorn, in a larger ve&s;&s;el,
with &s;ixty men; and they were moreover e&s;corted by fifty
troopers who rode along the bank of the river. The large
boat out-&s;ailed the other, and the hor&s;emen mi&s;took their
way in the dark. A French partizan, with five and thirty
men from Gueldres, who lurked among the ru&s;hes in wait
for prey, &s;ei&s;ed the rope by which the boat was drawn,
hauled it a&s;hore, di&s;charged their &s;mall arms and hand-grenades,
then ru&s;hing into it, &s;ecured the &s;oldiers before
they could put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence. The
Earl of Marlborough was accompanied by General Opdam,
and Mynheer Gueldermal&s;en, one of the deputies, who
were provided with pa&s;&s;ports. The Earl had neglected
this precaution: but recollecting he had an old pa&s;&s;port
for his brother General Churchill, he produced it without
any emotion; and the partizan was in &s;uch confu&s;ion that
he never examined the date. Neverthele&s;s, he rifled their
<PB N="428" REF="434">
baggage, carried off the guard as pri&s;oners, and allowed
the boat to proceed. The Governor of Venlo receiving in|formation
that the Earl was &s;urpri&s;ed by a party, and con|veyed
to Gueldres, immediately marched out with his
whole garri&s;on to inve&s;t that place. The &s;ame imperfect
account being tran&s;mitted to Holland, filled the whole
province with con&s;ternation. The States forthwith a&s;&s;em|bling,
re&s;olved that all their forces &s;hould march immedi|ately
to Gueldres, and threaten the garri&s;on of the place
with the utmo&s;t extremities, unle&s;s they would immedi|ately
deliver the General. But before the&s;e orders could
be di&s;patched, the Earl arrived at the Hague, to the in|expre&s;&s;ible
joy of the people, who already looked upon
him as their faviour and protector.</P>
<P>&sect; XIV. The French arms were not quite &s;o unfortunate
on the Rhine as in Flanders. The Elector of Bavaria &s;ur|pri&s;ed
the city of Ulm in Suabia, by a &s;tratagem, and
then declared for France, which had by this time comply|ed
with all his demands. The diet of the empire a&s;&s;embled
at Rati&s;bon were &s;o incen&s;ed at his conduct in &s;eizing the
city of Ulm by per&s;idy, that they pre&s;ented a memorial
to his Imperial Maje&s;ty, reque&s;ting he would proceed again&s;t
the Elector, according to the con&s;titutions of the empire.
They re&s;olved by a plurality of voices to declare war, in the
name of the empire, again&s;t the French King and the Duke
of Anjou, for having invaded &s;everal fiefs of the empire in Ita|ly,
the archbi&s;hoprick of Cologn, and the dioce&s;e of Liege:
and they forbad the mini&s;ters of Bavaria and Cologn to
appear in the general diet. In vain did the&s;e powers pro|te&s;t
again&s;t their proceedings. The empire's declaration
of war was publi&s;hed and notified, in the name of the
diet, to the Cardinal of Limberg, the Emperor's commi&s;|&s;ioner.
Mean while the French made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of
Neuburgh, in the circle of Suabia, while Louis Prince of Ba|den,
being weakened by &s;ending off detachments, was oblig|ed
to lie inactive in his camp near Fridlinguen. The French
army was divided into two bodies, commanded by the Mar|quis
de Villars and the Count de Gui&s;card; and the Prince,
<PB N="429" REF="435">
thinking him&s;elf in danger of being enclo&s;ed by the enemy,
re&s;olved to decamp. Villars immediately pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine,
to fall upon him in his retreat; and an ob&s;tinate engage|ment
en&s;uing, the Imperiali&s;ts were overpowered by num|bers.
The Prince having lo&s;t two thou&s;and men, aban|doned
the field of battle to the enemy, together with his
baggage, artillery, and ammunition, and retired towards
Stauffen, without being pur&s;ued. The French army,
even after they had gained the battle, were unaccountably
&s;ei&s;ed with &s;uch a panick, that if the Imperial general had
faced them with two regiments, he would have &s;natched
the victory from Villars, who was upon this occa&s;ion &s;a|luted
mare&s;chal of France by the &s;oldiers; and next day
the town of Fridlinguen &s;urrendered. The Prince being
joined by &s;ome troops under General Thungen, and other
re-enforcements, re&s;olved to give battle to the enemy:
but Villars declined an engagement, and repa&s;&s;ed the
Rhine. Towards the latter end of October, Count Tallard,
and the Marquis de Lomarie, with a body of eighteen
thou&s;and men, reduced Triers and Traerbach: on the
other hand, the Prince of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, with a detachment
from the allied army at Liege, retook from the French
the towns of Zinch, Lintz, Bri&s;ac, and Andernach.</P>
<P>&sect; XV. In Italy, Prince Eugene laboured under a total ne|glect
of the Imperial court, where his enemies, on pretence
of &s;upporting the King of the Romans in his fir&s;t cam|paign,
weaned the Emperor's attention entirely from his
affairs on the other &s;ide of the Alps; &s;o that he left his
be&s;t army to moulder away for want of recruits and re|enforcements.
The Prince, thus abandoned, could not
prevent the Duke de Vendome from relieving Mantua,
and was obliged to relinqui&s;h &s;ome other places he had
taken. Philip King of Spain, being in&s;pired with the am|bition
of putting an end to the war in this country, &s;ailed
in per&s;on for Naples, where he was vi&s;ited by the Cardinal|legate,
with a compliment from the Pope; yet he could
not obtain the inve&s;titure of the kingdom from his holi|ne&s;s.
The Emperor, however, was &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted at the em|ba&s;&s;y
<PB N="430" REF="436">
which the Pope had &s;ent to Philip, that he ordered
his amba&s;&s;ador at Rome to withdraw. Philip proceeded
from Naples to Final, under convoy of the French fleet
which had brought him to Italy: Here he had an inter|view
with the Duke of Savoy, who began to be alarmed
at the pro&s;pect of the French King's being ma&s;ter of the
Milane&s;e; and, in a letter to the Duke of Vendome, he
forbade him to engage Prince Eugene until he him&s;elf
&s;hould arrive in the camp. Prince Eugene, under&s;tanding
that the French army intended to attack Luzzara and
Gua&s;talla, pa&s;&s;ed the Po, with an army of about half the
number of the enemy, and po&s;ted him&s;elf behind the dyke
of Zero, in &s;uch a manner that the French were ignorant
of his &s;ituation. He concluded, that on their arrival at the
ground they had cho&s;en, the hor&s;e would march out to
forage, while the re&s;t of the army would be employed in
pitching tents, and providing for their refre&s;hment. His
de&s;ign was to &s;eize that opportunity of attacking them,
not doubting that he &s;hould obtain a complete victory:
but he was di&s;appointed by mere accident. An adjutant,
with an advanced guard, had the curio&s;ity to a&s;cend the
dyke, in order to view the country, when he di&s;covered
the Imperial infantry lying on their faces, and the hor&s;e
in the rear, ranged in order of battle. The French camp
was immediately alarmed; and as the intermediate ground
was covered with hedges, which obliged the a&s;&s;ailants to
defile, the enemy were in a po&s;ture of defence before the
Imperiali&s;ts could advance to action: neverthele&s;s, the
Prince attacked them with great vivacity, in hopes of
di&s;ordering their line, which gave way in &s;everal places:
but night interpo&s;ing, he was obliged to de&s;i&s;t; and in a
few days the French reduced Luzzara and Gua&s;talla.
The Prince, however, maintained his po&s;ts, and Philip
returned to Spain without having obtained any con&s;idera|ble
advantage.</P>
<P>&sect; XVI. The French King employed all his artifice and
intrigues in rai&s;ing up new enemies again&s;t the confede|rates.
He is &s;aid to have bribed Count Mansfield, pre&s;i|dent
of the council of war at Vienna, to withhold the &s;up|plies
<PB N="431" REF="437">
from Prince Eugene in Italy. At the Ottoman
Porte he had actually gained over the Vi&s;ir, who engaged
to renew the war with the Emperor. But the Mufti and
all the other great officers were aver&s;e to this de&s;ign, and
the Vi&s;ir fell a &s;acrifice to their re&s;entment. Louis conti|nued
to embroil the kingdom of Poland by means of the
Cardinal Primate. The young King of Sweden advanced
to Li&s;&s;au, where he defeated Augu&s;tus. Then he took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Cracow, and rai&s;ed contributions; nor could he
be per&s;uaded to retreat, although the Mu&s;covites and
Lithuanians had ravaged Livonia, and even made an ir|ruption
into Sweden.</P>
<P>&sect; XVII. The operations of the combined &s;quadrons at
&s;ea did not fully an&s;wer the expectations of the publick.
On the twelfth day of May, Sir John Munden &s;ailed with
twelve &s;hips, to intercept a French &s;quadron appointed as
a convoy to a new viceroy of Mexico, from Corunna to
the We&s;t Indies. On the twenty-eighth day of the month,
he cha&s;ed fourteen &s;ail of French &s;hips into Corunna.
Then he called a council of war, in which it was agreed,
that as the place was &s;trongly fortified, and by the intel|ligence
they had received, it appeared that &s;eventeen of
the enemy's &s;hips of war rode at anchor in the harbour,
it would be expedient for them to follow the latter part of
their in&s;tructions, by which they were directed to crui&s;e
in &s;oundings for the protection of the trade. They returned
accordingly, and being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by want of provi&s;ions,
came into port, to the general di&s;content of the nation.
For the &s;atisfaction of the people, Sir John Munden was
tried by a court-martial, and acquitted: but as this mi&s;|carriage
had rendered him very unpopular, Prince George
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him from the &s;ervice. We have already hinted,
that King William had projected a &s;cheme to reduce Ca|diz,
with intention to act afterwards again&s;t the Spani&s;h
&s;ettlements in the We&s;t-Indies. This de&s;ign Queen Anne
re&s;olved to put in execution. Sir George Rooke com|manded
the fleet, and the Duke of Ormond was appointed
general of the land-forces de&s;tined for this expedition.
<PB N="432" REF="438">
The combined &s;quadrons amounted to fifty &s;hips of the
line, exclu&s;ive of frigates, fire-&s;hips, and &s;maller ve&s;&s;els;
and the number of &s;oldiers embarked was not far &s;hort of
fourteen thou&s;and. In the latter end of June the fleet &s;ailed
from St. Helen's: on the twelfth of Augu&s;t they an|chored
at the di&s;tance of two leagues from Cadiz. Next
day the Duke of Ormond &s;ummoned the Duke de Bran|caccio,
who was governor, to &s;ubmit to the Hou&s;e of
Au&s;tria; but that officer an&s;wered, he would acquit him|&s;elf
honourably of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him by the King.
On the fifteenth the Duke of Ormond landed with his for|ces
in the bay of Bulls, under cover of a &s;mart fire from
&s;ome frigates, and repul&s;ed a body of Spani&s;h cavalry:
then he &s;ummoned the governor of Fort St. Catharine's
to &s;urrender; and received an an&s;wer, importing, that
the garri&s;on was prepared for his reception. A declaration
was publi&s;hed in the Spani&s;h language, intimating, that
the allies did not come as enemies to Spain; but only to
free them from the yoke of France, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in e&s;|tabli&s;hing
them&s;elves under the government of the Hou&s;e
of Au&s;tria. The&s;e profe&s;&s;ions produced very little effect
among the Spaniards, who were either cooled in the$$ at|tachment
to that family, or provoked by the exce&s;&s;es of
the Engli&s;h troops: The&s;e having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Fort
St. Catharine, and Port St. Mary's, in&s;tead of protecting,
plundered the natives, notwith&s;tanding the &s;trict orders
i&s;&s;ued by the Duke of Ormond, to prevent this &s;canda|lous
practice: even &s;ome general officers were concerned
in the pillage. A battery was rai&s;ed again&s;t Montagorda|fort
oppo&s;ite to the Puntal: but the attempt mi&s;carried,
and the troops were re-embarked.</P>
<P>&sect; XVIII. Captain Hardy having been &s;ent to water in
Lagos-bay, received intelligence that the galleons from
the We&s;t-Indies had put into Vigo, under convoy of a
French &s;quadron. He &s;ailed immediately in que&s;t of
Sir George Rooke, who was now on his voyage back to
England, and falling in with him on the &s;ixth day
of October, communicated the &s;ub&s;tance of what he
<PB N="433" REF="439">
had learned. Rooke immediately called a council of war,
in which it was determined to alter their cour&s;e, and attack
the enemy at Vigo. He forthwith detached &s;ome &s;mall
ve&s;&s;els for intelligence, and received a confirmation, that
the galleons, and the &s;quadron commanded by Chateau
Renault, were actually in the harbour. They &s;ailed thither,
and appeared before the place on the eleventh day of
October. The pa&s;&s;age into the harbour was narrow, &s;e|cured
by batteries, forts, and brea&s;t-works on each &s;ide;
by a &s;trong boom, con&s;i&s;ting of iron chains, topma&s;ts, and
cables, moored at each end to a &s;eventy-gun &s;hip; and forti|fied
within by five &s;hips of the &s;ame &s;trength, lying athwart
the channel, with their broad-&s;ides to the offing. As the
fir&s;t and &s;econd rates of the combined fleets were too large
to enter, the admirals &s;hifted their flags into &s;maller &s;hips;
and a divi&s;ion of five-and-twenty Engli&s;h and Dutch &s;hips
of the line, with their frigates, fire&s;hips, and ketches, was
de&s;tined for the&s;e rvice. In order to facilitate the attack,
the Duke of Ormond landed with five-and-twenty hundred
men, at the di&s;tance of &s;ix miles from Vigo, and took by
a&s;&s;ault a fort and platform of forty pieces of cannon, at the
entrance of the harbour. The Briti&s;h en&s;ign was no &s;ooner
&s;een flying at the top of this fort, than the &s;hips ad|vanced
to the attack. Vice-Admiral Hop&s;on, in the Tor|bay,
crowding all his &s;ail, ran directly again&s;t the boom,
which was broken by the fir&s;t &s;hock: then the whole
&s;quadron entered the harbour, through a prodigious fire
from the enemy's &s;hips and batteries. The&s;e la&s;t, how|ever,
were &s;oon &s;tormed and taken by the grenadiers who
had been landed. The great &s;hips lay again&s;t the forts at
each &s;ide of the harbour, which in a little time they
&s;ilenced; though Vice-Admiral Hop&s;on narrowly e&s;caped
from a fire&s;hip by which he was boarded. After a very
vigorous engagement, the French, finding them&s;elves un|able
to cope with &s;uch an adver&s;ary, re&s;olved to de&s;troy
their &s;hips and galleons, that they might not fall into the
hands of the victors. They accordingly burned and ran
a&s;hore eight &s;hips and as many advice-boats; but ten
<PB N="434" REF="440">
&s;hips of war were taken, together with eleven galleons.
Though they had &s;ecured the be&s;t part of their plate and
merchandi&s;e before the Engli&s;h fleet arrived, the value of
fourteen millions of pieces of eight, in plate and rich
commodities, was de&s;troyed in &s;ix galleons that peri&s;hed;
and about half that value was brought off by the conque|rors:
&s;o that this was a dreadful blow to the enemy, and a
noble-acqui&s;ition to the allies. Immediately after this ex|ploit
Sir George Rooke was joined by Sir Cloude&s;ley
Shovel, who had been &s;ent out with a &s;quadron to inter|cept
the galleons. This officer was left to bring home the
prizes, and di&s;mantle the fortifications, while Rooke re|turned
in triumph to England.</P>
<P>&sect; XIX. The glory which the Engli&s;h acquired in this
expedition was in &s;ome mea&s;ure tarni&s;hed by the conduct
of &s;ome officers in the We&s;t Indies. Thither Admiral
Benbow had been detached with a &s;quadron of ten &s;ail, in
the cour&s;e of the preceding year. At Jamaica he received
intelligence, that Mon&s;ieur Du Ca&s;&s;e was in the neigh|bourhood
of Hi&s;paniola, and re&s;olved to beat up to that
i&s;land. At Leogane he fell in with a French &s;hip of fifty
guns, which her captain ran a&s;hore and blew up. He
took &s;everal other ve&s;&s;els, and having alarmed Petit-Gua|vas,
bore away for Donna Maria bay, where he under|&s;tood
that Du Ca&s;&s;e had &s;ailed for the coa&s;t of Cartha|gena.
Benbow re&s;olved to follow the &s;ame cour&s;e; and
on the nineteenth of Augu&s;t di&s;covered the enemy's &s;qua|dron
near St. Martha, con&s;i&s;ting of ten fail, &s;teering along
&s;hore. He formed the line, and an engagement enfued,
in which he was very ill &s;econded by &s;ome of his captains.
Neverthele&s;s, the battle continued till night, and he de|termined
to renew it next morning, when he perceived all
his &s;hips at the di&s;tance of three or four miles a&s;tern, ex|cept
the Ruby, commanded by Captain George Walton,
who joined him in plying the enemy with cha&s;e-guns.
On the twenty-fir&s;t the&s;e two &s;hips engaged the French
&s;quadron; and the Ruby was &s;o di&s;abled, that the Ad|miral
was obliged to &s;end her back to Jamaica. Next day
<PB N="435" REF="441">
the Greenwich, commanded by Wade, was five leagues
a&s;tern: and the wind changing, the enemy had the ad|vantage
of the weather-gage. On the twenty-third the
Admiral renewed the battle with his &s;ingle &s;hip, un&s;u|&s;tained
by the re&s;t of the &s;quadron. On the twenty-fourth
his leg was &s;hattered by a chain-&s;hot; notwith&s;tanding
which accident, he remained on the quarter-deck in a
cradle, and continued the engagement. One of the large&s;t
&s;hips of the enemy lying like a wreck upon the water, four
&s;ail of the Engli&s;h &s;quadron poured their broad&s;ides into
her, and then ran to leeward, without paying any regard
to the &s;ignal for battle. Then the French bearing down
upon the Admiral with their whole force, &s;hot away his
main-top-&s;ail-yard, and damaged his rigging in &s;uch a
manner, that he was obliged to lie by and re&s;it, while
they took their di&s;abled &s;hip in tow. During this interval,
he called a council of his captains, and expo&s;tulated with
them on their behaviour. They ob&s;erved, that the French
were very &s;trong, and advi&s;ed him to de&s;i&s;t. He plainly
perceived that he was betrayed, and with the utmo&s;t re|luctance
returned to Jamaica, having not only lo&s;t a leg,
but al&s;o received a large wound in his face, and another in
his arm, while he in per&s;on attempted to board the French
admiral. Exa&s;perated at the treachery of his captains, he
granted a commi&s;&s;ion to Rear. Admiral Whet&s;tone, and
other officers, to hold a court-martial, and try them for
cowardice. Hud&s;on, of the Pendennis, died before his
trial: Kirby and Wade were convicted, and &s;entenced to
be &s;hot: Con&s;table, of the Wind&s;or, was ca&s;hiered and
impri&s;oned: Vincent, of the Falmouth, and Fogg, the
Admiral's own captain of the Breda, were convicted of
having &s;igned a paper, that they would not &s;ight under
Benbow's command: but, as they behaved gallantly in the
action, the court inflicted upon them no other puni&s;hment,
than that of a provi&s;ional &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. Captain Walton
had likewi&s;e joined in the con&s;piracy while he was heated
with the &s;umes of intoxication: but he afterwards re|nounced
the engagement, and fought with admirable cou|rage
<PB N="436" REF="442">
until his &s;hip was di&s;abled. The boi&s;terous manners
of Benbow had produced this ba&s;e confederacy. He was
a rough &s;eaman; but remarkably brave, hone&s;t, and ex|perienced
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>When one of his lieutenants expre&s;&s;ed his &s;orrow for the lo&s;s of the Admiral's leg, &startq;I am &s;orry for it, too (replied the gallant Benbow) but I had rather have lo&s;t them both than have &s;een this di&s;honour brought upon the Engli&s;h nation. But, do you hear? If another &s;hot &s;hould take me off, behave like brave men, and fight it out.&endq;&mdash;When Du Ca&s;&s;e arrived at Carthagena, he wrote a letter to Benbow to this effect:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>&startq;SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>&startq;I Had little hope on Monday la&s;t but to have &s;upped in your cabin; but it plea&s;ed God to order it otherwi&s;e. I am thankful for it. As for tho&s;e cowardly captains who de&s;erted you, hang them up; for, by God, they de&s;erve it.&endq; Your's,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>DU CASSF.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P></NOTE>. He took this mi&s;carriage &s;o much to heart,
that he became melancholy, and his grief co-operating
with the fever occa&s;ioned by his wounds, put a period to
his life. Wade and Kirby were &s;ent home in the Bri&s;tol;
and, on their arrival at Plymouth, &s;hot on board of the
&s;hip, by virtue of a dead warrant for their immediate exe|cution,
which had lain there for &s;ome time. The &s;ame
precaution had been taken in all the we&s;tern ports, in or|der
to prevent applications in their favour.</P>
<P>&sect; XX. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the Queen &s;eemed
to be happy in the affection of her &s;ubjects. Though the
continuance of the parliament was limited to &s;ix months
after the King's decea&s;e, &s;he di&s;&s;olved it by proclamation
before the term was expired: and i&s;&s;ued writs for electing
another, in which the Tory intere&s;t predominated. In
the &s;ummer the Queen gave audience to the Count de
Platens, envoy extraordinary from the Elector of Hanover:
then &s;he made a progre&s;s with her hu&s;band to Oxford,
Bath, and Bri&s;tol, where &s;he was received with all the
marks of the mo&s;t genuine affection. The new parliament
meeting on the twentieth day of October, Mr. Harley
was cho&s;en &s;peaker. The Queen in her &s;peech declared,
&s;he had &s;ummoned them to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in carrying on the
ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary war in which the nation was engaged.
She de&s;ired the Commons would in&s;pect the accounts of
<PB N="437" REF="443">
the publick receipts and payments, that if any abu&s;es had
crept into the management of the finances, they might be
detected, and the offenders puni&s;hed. She told them,
that the funds a&s;&s;igned in the la&s;t parliament had not pro|duced
the &s;ums granted; and that the deficiency was not
&s;upplied even by the hundred thou&s;and pounds which &s;he
had paid from her own revenue for the publick &s;ervice,
She expre&s;&s;ed her concern for the di&s;appointment at Cadiz,
as well as for the abu&s;es committed at port St. Mary's
which had obliged her to give directions for the &s;tricte&s;t
examination of the particulars. She hoped they would
find time to con&s;ider of &s;ome better and more effectual me|thod
to prevent the exportation of wool, and improve that
manufacture, which &s;he was determined to encourage.
She profe&s;&s;ed a firm per&s;ua&s;ion, that the affection of her
&s;ubjects was the &s;ure&s;t pledge of their duty and obedience.
She promi&s;ed to defend and maintain the church as by law
e&s;tabli&s;hed; and to protect her &s;ubjects in the full enjoy|ments
of all their rights and liberties. She prote&s;ted, that
&s;he relied on their care of her: &s;he &s;aid her intere&s;t and
their's were in&s;eparable; and that her endeavours &s;hould
never be wanting to make them all &s;afe and happy.&mdash;She
was pre&s;ented with a very affectionate addre&s;s from either
Hou&s;e, congratulating her upon the glorious &s;ucce&s;s of her
arms, and tho&s;e of her allies, under the command of the
Earl of Marlborough: but that of the Commons was
di&s;tingui&s;hed by an implicated reproach on the late reign,
importing, that the wonderful progre&s;s of her Maje&s;ty's
arms under the Earl of Marlborough had &s;ignally &startq;re|trieved&endq;
the ancient honour and glory of the Engli&s;h
nation. This expre&s;&s;ion had excited a warm debate in the
Hou&s;e, in the cour&s;e of which many &s;evere reflections were
made on the memory of King William. At length, the
que&s;tion was put, Whether the word &startq;Retrieved&endq; &s;hould
remain? and carried in the affirmative, by a majority of
one hundred.</P>
<P>&sect; XXI. The &s;trength of the Tories appeared in nothing
more con&s;picuous than in their enquiry concerning con|troverted
<PB N="438" REF="444">
elections. The borough of Hindon, near Sali&s;bury,
was convicted of bribery, and a bill brought in for di&s;|franchi&s;ing
the town: yet, no vote pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the
per&s;on who exerci&s;ed this corruption, becau&s;e he hap|pened
to be a Tory. Mr. Howe was declared duely elect|ed
for Glouce&s;ter&s;hire, though the majority of the electors
had voted for the other candidate. Sir John Packington
exhibited a complaint again&s;t the Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter
and his &s;on, for having endeavoured to prevent his election:
the Commons having taken it into con&s;ideration, re&s;olved,
that the proceedings of William Lord Bi&s;hop of Wor|ce&s;ter,
and his &s;on, had been malicious, unchri&s;tian, and
arbitrary, in high violation of the liberties and privi|leges
of the Commons of England. They voted an addre&s;s
to the Queen, de&s;iring her to remove the father from the
office of lord-almoner; and they ordered the Attorney-General
to pro&s;ecute the &s;on, after his privilege as member
of the convocation &s;hould be expired. A counter-addre&s;s
was immediately voted, and pre&s;ented by the Lords, be|&s;eeching
her Maje&s;ty would not remove the Bi&s;hop of
Worce&s;ter from the place of lord-almoner, until he &s;hould
be found guilty of &s;ome crime by due cour&s;e of law; as it
was the undoubted right of every lord of parliament, and
of every &s;ubject of England, to have an opportunity to
make his defence before he &s;uffers any &s;ort of puni&s;hment.
The Queen &s;aid &s;he had not as yet received any complaint
again&s;t the Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter: but &s;he looked upon it
as her undoubted right to continue or di&s;place any &s;ervant
attending upon her own per&s;on, when &s;he &s;hould think
proper. The Peers having received this an&s;wer, unani|mou&s;ly
re&s;olved, That no lord of their Hou&s;e ought to
&s;uffer any &s;ort of puni&s;hment by any proceedings of the
Hou&s;e of Commons, otherwi&s;e than according to the known
and ancient rules and methods of parliament. When the
Commons attended the Queen with their addre&s;s again&s;t
the Bi&s;hop, &s;he &s;aid &s;he was &s;orry there was occa&s;ion for
&s;uch a remon&s;trance, and that the Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter
&s;hould no longer continue to &s;upply the place of her
<PB N="439" REF="445">
almoner. This regard to their addre&s;s was a flagrant
proof of her partiality to the Tories, who &s;eemed to ju&s;tify
her attachment by their compliance and liberality.</P>
<P>&sect; XXII. In deliberating on the &s;upplies, they agreed
to all the demands of the mini&s;try. They voted forty
thou&s;and &s;eamen, and the like number of land forces, to
act in conjunction with tho&s;e of the allies. For the
maintenance of the&s;e la&s;t, they granted eight hundred
and thirty-three thou&s;and eight hundred and twenty-&s;ix
pounds; be&s;ides three hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds
for guards and garri&s;ons; &s;eventy thou&s;and nine hundred and
&s;eventy-three pounds for ordnance; and fifty-one thou&s;and
eight hundred and forty-three pounds for &s;ub&s;idies to the
allies. Lord Shannon arriving with the news of the
&s;ucce&s;s at Vigo, the Queen appointed a day of thank&s;giv|ing
for the &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s of her arms under the Earl of
Marlborough, the Duke of Ormond, and Sir George
Rooke; and, on that day, which was the twelfth of No|vember,
&s;he went in &s;tate to St. Paul's church, attended
by both Hou&s;es of Parliament. Next day the Peers voted
the thanks of their Hou&s;e to the Duke of Ormond for
his &s;ervices at Vigo; and, at the &s;ame time, drew up an
addre&s;s to the Queen, de&s;iring &s;he would order the Duke
of Ormond and Sir George Rooke to lay before them an
account of their proceedings: a reque&s;t with which her
Maje&s;ty complied. Tho&s;e two officers were likewi&s;e thank|ed
by the Hou&s;e of Commons: Vice-Admiral Hop&s;on was
knighted, and gratified with a con&s;iderable pen&s;ion. The
Duke of Ormond, at his return from the expedition, com|plained
openly of Rooke's conduct, and &s;eemed determined
to &s;ubject him to a publick accu&s;ation: but that officer was
&s;uch a favourite among the Commons, that the court was
afraid to di&s;oblige them by an impeachment, and took great
pains to mitigate the Duke's re&s;entment. This nobleman
was appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland, and Rooke was
admitted into the privy-council. A motion, however,
being made in the Hou&s;e of Lords, that the Admiral's in|&s;tructions
and journals relating to the la&s;t expedition might
be examined, a committee was appointed for that purpo&s;e,
<PB N="440" REF="446">
and prepared an unfavourable report: but it was rejected
by a majority of the Hou&s;e; and they voted, That Sir
George Rooke had done his duty, pur&s;uant to the councils
of war, like a brave officer, to the honour of the Briti&s;h
nation.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIII. On the twenty-fir&s;t day of November, the
Queen &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e of Commons by Mr.
Secretary Hedges, recommending further provi&s;ion for the
Prince her hu&s;band, in ca&s;e he &s;hould &s;urvive her. This
me&s;&s;age being con&s;idered, Mr. Howe moved, That the
yearly &s;um of one hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;hould be
&s;ettled on the Prince, in ca&s;e he &s;hould &s;urvive her Maje&s;ty.
No oppo&s;ition was made to the propo&s;al: but warm de|bates
were excited by a clau&s;e in the bill, exempting the
Prince from that part of the act of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion by which
&s;trangers, though naturalized, were rendered incapable
of holding employments. This clau&s;e related only to
tho&s;e who &s;hould be naturalized in a future reign;
and indeed was calculated as a re&s;triction upon the
Hou&s;e of Hanover. Many members argued again&s;t
the clau&s;e of exemption, becau&s;e it &s;eemed to imply,
that per&s;ons already naturalized would be excluded from
employments in the next reign, though already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of the right of natural-born &s;ubjects, a con&s;equence plainly
contradictory to the meaning of the act. Others oppo&s;ed
it, becau&s;e the Lords had already re&s;olved by a vote, That
they would never pa&s;s any bill &s;ent up from the Commons,
to which a clau&s;e foreign to the bill &s;hould be tacked; and
this clau&s;e they affirmed to be a tack, as an incapacity to
hold employments was a circum&s;tance altogether di&s;tinct
from a &s;ettlement in money. The Queen expre&s;&s;ed un|common
eagerne&s;s in behalf of this bill; and the court in|fluence
was managed &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that it pa&s;&s;ed through
both Hou&s;es, though not without an ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition,
and a formal prote&s;t by &s;even-and-twenty peers.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIV. The Earl of Marlborough arriving in Eng|land
about the latter end of November, received the thanks
of the Commons for his great and &s;ignal &s;ervices, which
were &s;o acceptable to the Queen, that &s;he created him a
<PB N="441" REF="447">
Duke, gratified him with a pen&s;ion of five thou&s;and
pounds upon the revenue of the Po&s;t-Office during his
natural life; and, in a me&s;&s;age to the Commons, expre&s;&s;ed
a de&s;ire, that they would find &s;ome method to &s;ettle it on
the heirs male of his body. This intimation was produc|tive
of warm debates, during which Sir Chri&s;topher
Mu&s;grave ob&s;erved, that he would not derogate from the
Duke's eminent &s;ervices: but he affirmed his grace had
been very well paid for them, by the profitable employ|ments
which he and his duche&s;s enjoyed. The Duke, un|der&s;tanding
that the Commons were heated by the &s;ub|ject,
begged her Maje&s;ty would rather forego her gracious
me&s;&s;age in his behalf, than create any unea&s;ine&s;s on his
account, which might embarra&s;s her affairs, and be of ill
con&s;equence to the publick. Then &s;he &s;ent another me&s;|&s;age
to the Hou&s;e, &s;ignifying, that the Duke of Marl|borough
had declined her interpo&s;ition. Notwith&s;tand|ing
this declaration, the Commons in a body pre&s;ented
an addre&s;s, acknowledging the eminent &s;ervices of the
Duke of Marlborough, yet expre&s;&s;ing their apprehen&s;ion
of making a precedent to alienate the revenue of the crown,
which had been &s;o much reduced by the exorbitant
grants of the late reign, and &s;o lately &s;ettled and &s;ecured
by her Maje&s;ty's unparalleled grace and goodne&s;s. The
Queen was &s;atisfied with their apology; but their refu|&s;al
in all probability helped to alienate the Duke from the
Tories, with whom he had been hitherto connected.</P>
<P>&sect; XXV. In the beginning of January, the Queen gave
the Hou&s;e of Commons to under&s;tand, that the States-General
had pre&s;&s;ed her to augment her forces, as the
only means to render ineffectual the great and early pre|parations
of the enemy. The Commons immediately
re&s;olved, That ten thou&s;and men &s;hould be hired, as an
augmentation of the forces to act in conjunction with the
allies; but, on condition that an immediate &s;top &s;hould
be put to all commerce and corre&s;pondence with France
and Spain on the part of the States-General. The Lords
pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the Queen on the &s;ame &s;ubject,
and to the &s;ame effect; and &s;he owned that the condition
<PB N="442" REF="448">
was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the good of the whole alliance.
The Dutch, even after the declaration of war, had carried
on a traffick with the French; and, at this very juncture,
Louis found it impo&s;&s;ible to make remittances of money
to the Elector of Bavaria in Germany, and to his forces
in Italy, except through the canal of Engli&s;h, Dutch,
and Geneva merchants. The States-General, though
&s;hocked at the imperious manner in which the parliament
of England pre&s;cribed their conduct, complied with the
demand without he&s;itation, and publi&s;hed a prohibition
of all commerce with the &s;ubjects of France and Spain.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVI. The Commons of this parliament had no|thing
more at heart than a bill again&s;t occa&s;ional confor|mity.
The Tories affected to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves as
the only true friends to the church and monarchy; and
they hated the di&s;&s;enters with a mixture of &s;piritual and
political di&s;gu&s;t. They looked upon the&s;e la&s;t as an in|truding
&s;ect, which con&s;tituted great part of the Whig
faction that extorted &s;uch immen&s;e &s;ums of money from
the nation in the late reign, and involved it in pernicious
engagements, from whence it had no pro&s;pect of deliver|ance.
They con&s;idered them as encroaching &s;chi&s;maticks
that di&s;graced and endangered the hierarchy; and tho&s;e
of their own communion who recommended moderation,
they branded with the epithets of lukewarm chri&s;tians,
betrayers, and apo&s;tates. They now re&s;olved to approve
them&s;elves zealous &s;ons of the church, by &s;ei&s;ing the
fir&s;t opportunity that was in their power to di&s;tre&s;s the
di&s;&s;enters. In order to pave the way to this per&s;ecution,
&s;ermons were preached, and pamphlets were printed to
blacken the character of the &s;ect, and inflame the popular
re&s;entment again&s;t them. On the fourth day of No|vember,
Mr. Bromley, Mr. St. John, and Mr. An|ne&s;ley,
were ordered by the Hou&s;e of Commons to
bring in a bill for preventing occa&s;ional conformity. In
the preamble all per&s;ecution for con&s;cience &s;ake was con|demned:
neverthele&s;s, it enacted, That all tho&s;e who
had taken the &s;acrament and te&s;t for offices of tru&s;t, or the
<PB N="443" REF="449">
magi&s;tracy of corporations, and afterwards frequented any
meeting of di&s;&s;enters, &s;hould be di&s;abled from holding
their employments, pay a fine of one hundred pounds,
and five pounds for every day in which they continued to
act in their employments after having been at any &s;uch
meeting: they were al&s;o rendered incapable of holding
any other employment, till after one whole year's confor|mity;
and, upon a relap&s;e, the penalties and time of in|capacity
were doubled. The promoters of the bill alledged,
that an e&s;tabli&s;hed religion and national church were ab|&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary, when &s;o many impious men pretended
to in&s;piration, and deluded &s;uch numbers of the people:
that the mo&s;t effectual way to pre&s;erve this national church,
would be the maintenance of the civil power in the hands
of tho&s;e who expre&s;&s;ed their regard to the church in their
principles and practice: that the parliament, by the cor|poration
and te&s;t acts&punc; thought they had rai&s;ed a &s;ufficient
barrier to the hierarchy, never imagining that a &s;et of
men would ri&s;e up, who&s;e con&s;ciences would be too ten|der
to obey the laws, but hardened enough to break them:
that, as the la&s;t reign began with an act in favour of di&s;|&s;enters,
&s;o the Commons were de&s;irous that in the begin|ning
of her Maje&s;ty's au&s;picious government, an act &s;hould
pa&s;s in favour of the church of England: that this bill did
not entrench on the act of toleration, or deprive the di&s;|&s;enters
of any privileges they enjoyed by law, or add any
thing to the legal rights of the church of England: that
occa&s;ional conformity was an eva&s;ion of the law, by which
the di&s;&s;enters might in&s;inuate them&s;elves into the manage|ment
of all corporations: that a &s;eparation from the church,
to which a man's con&s;cience will allow him occa&s;ionally to
conform, is a mere &s;chi&s;m, which in it&s;elf was &s;inful,
without the &s;uperaddition of a temporal law to make it an
offence: that the toleration was intended only for the ea&s;e
of tender con&s;ciences, and not to give a licen&s;e for occa|&s;ional
conformity: that conforming and nonconforming
were contradictions; for, nothing but a firm per&s;ua&s;ion
that the terms of communion required are &s;inful and un|lawful
could ju&s;tify the one; and this plainly condemns
<PB N="444" REF="450">
the other. The members who oppo&s;ed the bill argued,
That the di&s;&s;enters were generally well affected to the
pre&s;ent con&s;titution: that to bring any real hard&s;hip up|on
them, or give ri&s;e to jealou&s;ies and fears at &s;uch a junc|ture,
might be attended with dangerous con&s;equences:
that the toleration had greatly contributed to the &s;ecurity
and reputation of the church, and plainly proved, that li|berty
of con&s;cience and gentle mea&s;ures were the mo&s;t
effectual means for increa&s;ing the votaries of the church,
and dimini&s;hing the number of di&s;&s;enters: that the di&s;&s;en|ters
could not be termed &s;chi&s;maticks without bringing an
heavy charge upon the church of England, which had
not only tolerated &s;uch &s;chi&s;m, but even allowed commu|nion
with the reformed churches abroad: that the penal|ties
of this bill were more &s;evere than tho&s;e which the law
impo&s;ed on papi&s;ts, for a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the mo&s;t &s;olemn act of
their religion: in a word, that toleration and tenderne&s;s
had been always productive of peace and union, whereas
per&s;ecution had never failed to excite di&s;cord, and extend
&s;uper&s;tition. Many alterations and mitigations were pro|po&s;ed,
without effect. In the cour&s;e of the debates the di&s;|&s;enters
were mentioned and reviled with great acrimony;
and the bill pa&s;&s;ed the Lower Hou&s;e by virtue of a con&s;i|derable
majority.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVII. The Lords, apprehen&s;ive that the Com|mons
would tack it to &s;ome money-bill, voted, That the
annexing any clau&s;e to a money-bill was contrary to the
con&s;titution of the Engli&s;h government, and the u&s;age of
parliament. The bill met with a very warm oppo&s;ition
in the Upper Hou&s;e, where a con&s;iderable portion of the
Whig intere&s;t &s;till remained. The&s;e members believed that
the intention of the bill was to model corporations, &s;o as
to eject all tho&s;e who would not vote in elections for the
Tories. Some imagined this was a preparatory &s;tep to|wards
a repeal of the toleration: and others concluded
that the promoters of the bill de&s;igned to rai&s;e &s;uch di&s;tur|bances
at home, as would di&s;courage the allies abroad, and
render the pro&s;ecution of the war impracticable. The
majority of the bi&s;hops, and among the&s;e Burnet of
<PB N="445" REF="451">
Sarum, objected again&s;t it on the principles of moder|ation,
and from motives of con&s;cience. Neverthele&s;s, as
the court &s;upported this mea&s;ure with its whole power
and influence, the bill made its way through the Hou&s;e,
though not without alterations and amendments, which
were rejected by the Commons. The Lower Hou&s;e pre|tended
that the Lords had no right to alter any fines and
penalties that the Commons &s;hould fix in bills &s;ent up for
their concurrence, on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that tho&s;e were
matters concerning money, the peculiar province of the
Lower Hou&s;e: the Lords ordered a minute enquiry to be
made into all the rolls of parliament &s;ince the reign of Henry
the Seventh; and a great number of in&s;tances were
found, in which the Lords had begun the clau&s;es impo&s;ing
fines and penalties, altered the penalties which had been
fixed by the Commons, and even changed the u&s;es to
which they were applied. The&s;e precedents were entered
in the books; but the Commons re&s;olved to maintain
their point without engaging in any di&s;pute upon the &s;ub|ject.
After warm debates, and a free conference between
the two Hou&s;es, the Lords adhered to their amendments,
though this re&s;olution was carried by a majority of one
vote only: the Commons per&s;i&s;ted in rejecting them;
the bill mi&s;carried; and both Hou&s;es publi&s;hed their pro|ceedings,
by way of appeal to the nation<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">While this bill was depending&punc; Daniel de Foe publi&s;hed a pamphlet, in|tituled, &startq;The &s;horte&s;t way with the di&s;&s;enters: or, propo&s;als for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the church.&endq; The piece was a &s;evere &s;atire on the violence of the church-party. The Commons ordered it to be burned by the hands of the common hangman, and the author to be pro&s;ecuted. He was accordingly com|mitted to Newgate, tried, condomned to pay a fine of two hundred pounds, and &s;tand in the pillory.</NOTE>. A bill was
now brought into the Lower Hou&s;e, granting another
year's con&s;ideration to tho&s;e who had not taken the oath
abjuring the pretended Prince of Wales. The Lords
added three clau&s;es, importing, That tho&s;e per&s;ons who
&s;hould take the oath within the limited time might return
to their benefices and employments, unle&s;s they &s;hould
be already legally filled; that any per&s;on endeavouring to
defeat the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, as now limited by law,
<PB N="446" REF="452">
&s;hould be deemed guilty of high-trea&s;on: and that the
oath of abjuration &s;hould be impo&s;ed upon the &s;ubjects in
Ireland. The Commons made &s;ome oppo&s;ition to the fir&s;t
clau&s;e; but, at length, the que&s;tion being put, Whether
they &s;hould agree to the amendments? it was carried
in the affirmative by one voice.</P>
<P>&sect; XXVIII. No object engro&s;&s;ed more time, or pro|duced
more violent debates than did the enquiry into the
publick accounts. The commi&s;&s;ioners appointed for this
purpo&s;e pretended to have made great di&s;coveries. They
charged the Earl of Ranelagh, payma&s;ter-general of the
army, with flagrant mi&s;management. He acquitted him|&s;elf
in &s;uch a manner as &s;creened him from all &s;everity of
puni&s;hment: neverthele&s;s, they expelled him from the Hou&s;e
for a high crime and mi&s;demeanour, in mi&s;applying &s;everal
&s;ums of the publick money; and he thought proper to
re&s;ign his employment. A long addre&s;s was prepared and
pre&s;ented to the Queen, attributing the national debt to
mi&s;management of the funds; complaining that the old
methods of the Exchequer had been neglected; and that
iniquitous frauds had been committed by the commi&s;&s;ioners
of the prizes. Previous to this remon&s;trance, the Hou&s;e,
in con&s;equence of the report of the committee, had pa&s;&s;ed
&s;everal &s;evere re&s;olutions, particularly again&s;t Charles Lord
Hallifax, auditor of the receipt of the Exchequer, as
having neglected his duty, and been guilty of a breach of
tru&s;t. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, they actually be&s;ought the
Queen, in an addre&s;s, that &s;he would give directions to
the Attorney-general, to pro&s;ecute him for the &s;aid
offences; and &s;he promi&s;ed to comply with their reque&s;t.
On the other hand, the Lords appointed a committee to
examine all the ob&s;ervations which the commi&s;&s;ioners of
accounts had offered to both Hou&s;es. They a&s;cribed the
national debt to de&s;iciencies in the funds: they acquitted
Lord Hallifax, the lords of the Trea&s;ury, and their officers,
whom the Commons had accu&s;ed; and repre&s;ented the&s;e
circum&s;tances in an addre&s;s to the Queen, which was
afterwards printed with the vouchers to every particular.
<PB N="447" REF="453">
This difference blew up a fierce flame of di&s;cord between
the two Hou&s;es, which manife&s;ted their mutual animo&s;ity
in &s;peeches, votes, re&s;olutions, and conferences. The
Commons affirmed, That no cognizance the Lords could
take of the publick accounts would enable them to &s;upply
any deficiency, or appropriate any &s;urplu&s;age of the publick
money: that they could neither acquit nor condemn any
per&s;on what&s;oever, upon any enquiry ari&s;ing originally in
their own Hou&s;e; and that their attempt to acquit
Charles Lord Hallifax was unparliamentary. The Lords
in&s;i&s;ted upon their right to take cognizance originally of
all publick accounts; they affirmed, that in their re&s;olutions
with re&s;pect to Lord Hallifax they had proceeded according
to the rules of ju&s;tice. They owned, however, that their
re&s;olutions did not amount to any judgement or acquittal;
but that finding a vote of the Commons reflected upon a
member of their Hou&s;e, they thought fit to give their opinion
in their legi&s;lative authority. The Queen interpo&s;ed by a
me&s;&s;age to the Lords, de&s;iring they would di&s;patch the
bu&s;ine&s;s in which they were engaged. The di&s;pute con|tinued
even after this intimation: one conference was
held after another, till at length both &s;ides de&s;paired of
an accommodation. The Lords ordered their proceedings
to be printed, and the Commons followed their example.
On the twenty-&s;eventh day of February the Queen having
pa&s;&s;ed all the bills that were ready for the royal a&s;&s;ent,
ordered the Lord-Keeper to prorogue the parliament, after
having pronounced a &s;peech, in the u&s;ual &s;tile. She thanked
them for their zeal, affection, and di&s;patch; declared,
&s;he would encourage and maintain the church as by law
e&s;tabli&s;hed; de&s;ired they would con&s;ider &s;ome further laws
for re&s;training the great licen&s;e a&s;&s;umed of publi&s;hing
&s;candalous pamphlets and libels; and a&s;&s;ured them,
that all her &s;hare of the prizes which might be taken in
the war &s;hould be applied to the publick &s;ervice. By this
time the Earl of Roche&s;ter was entirely removed from the
Queen's councils. Finding him&s;elf out-weighed by the
intere&s;t of the Duke of Marlborough and Lord Godolphin,
<PB N="448" REF="454">
he had become &s;ullen and intractable; and rather than
repair to his government of Ireland, cho&s;e to re&s;ign the
office, which, as we have already ob&s;erved, was conferred
upon the Duke of Ormond, an accompli&s;hed nobleman,
who had acquired great popularity by the &s;ucce&s;s of the
expedition to Vigo. The parties in the Hou&s;e of Lords
were &s;o nearly matched, that the Queen, in order to
a&s;certain an undoubted majority in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion, created
four new peers<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e were John Granville created Baron Granville of otheridge, in the county of Devon: Heneage Finch, Baron of Guern&s;ey, in the county of Southampton; Sir John Lev$&s;on Gower, Ba$on Gower, of Sittenham, in York&s;hire; and Francis Seymour Conway, younge&s;t &s;on of Sir Edward Seymour, made Baron Conway, of Ragley, in the county of Warwick. At the &s;ame time, however, John Hervey, of the oppo&s;ite faction, was created Baron of Ickworth, in the county of Suffolk; and the Marquis of Nor|manby was honoured with the title of Duke of Buckingham&s;hire.</NOTE>, who had &s;ignalized them&s;elves by the
violence of their &s;peeches in the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>&sect; XXIX. The two Hou&s;es of convocation, which
were &s;ummoned with the parliament, bore a &s;trong affinity
with this a&s;&s;embly by the different intere&s;ts that prevailed
in the upper and lower. The la&s;t, in imitation of the
Commons, was de&s;irous of branding the preceding reign;
and it was with great difficulty they concurred with
the prelates in an addre&s;s of congratulation to her Maje&s;ty.
Then their former conte&s;t was revived. The Lower Hou&s;e
de&s;ired, in an application to the Archbi&s;hop of Canter|bury
and his &s;uffragans, that the matters in di&s;pute con|cerning
the manner of &s;ynodical proceedings, and the
right of the Lower Hou&s;e to hold intermediate a&s;&s;emblies,
might be taken into con&s;ideration, and &s;peedily deter|mined.
The bi&s;hops propo&s;ed, that in the intervals of
&s;e&s;&s;ions, the Lower Hou&s;e might appoint committees to
prepare matters; and when bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be brought
regularly before them, the archbi&s;hop would regulate the
prorogations in &s;uch a manner, that they &s;hould have
&s;ufficient time to &s;it and deliberate on the &s;ubject. This
offer did not &s;atisfy the Lower Hou&s;e, which was embold|ened
to per&s;i&s;t in its demand by a vote of the Commons.
<PB N="449" REF="455">
The&s;e, in con&s;equence of an addre&s;s of thanks from the cler|gy,
touching Mr. Lloyd, &s;on to the Bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter,
whom they ordered to be pro&s;ecuted after his privilege as
member of the convocation &s;hould be expired, had re|&s;olved,
That they would on all occa&s;ions a&s;&s;ert the ju&s;t
rights and privileges of the Lower Hou&s;e of convocation.
The prelates refu&s;ed to depart from the archbi&s;hop's right
of proroguing the whole convocation with con&s;ent of his
&s;uffragans. The Lower Hou&s;e propo&s;ed to refer the con|trover&s;y
to the Queen's deci&s;ion. The bi&s;hops declined
this expedient, as incon&s;i&s;tent with the epi&s;copal authority,
and the pre&s;idency of the archbi&s;hop. The Lower Hou&s;e
having incurred the imputation of favouring pre&s;bytery,
by this oppo&s;ition to the bi&s;hops, entered in their books a
declaration, acknowledging the order of bi&s;hops as &s;uperior
to pre&s;byters, and to be a divine apo&s;tolical in&s;titution.
Then they de&s;ired the bi&s;hops, in an addre&s;s, to concur
in &s;ettling the doctrine of the divine apo&s;tolical right of epi&s;|copacy,
that it might be a &s;tanding rule of the church.
They likewi&s;e pre&s;ented a petition to the Queen, com|plaining,
That in the convocation called in the year 1700
after an interruption of ten years, &s;everal que&s;tions having
ari&s;en concerning the rights and liberties of the Lower
Hou&s;e, the bi&s;hops had refu&s;ed a verbal conference: and
afterwards declined a propo&s;al to &s;ubmit the di&s;pute to
her Maje&s;ty's determination: they, therefore, fled for pro|tection
to her Maje&s;ty, begging &s;he would call the que&s;ti|on
into her own royal audience. The Queen promi&s;ed to
con&s;ider their petition, which was &s;upported by the Earl
of Nottingham; and ordered their council to examine
the affair, how it con&s;i&s;ted with law and cu&s;tom. Whether
their report was unfavourable to the Lower Hou&s;e, or the
Queen was unwilling to encourage the divi&s;ion, no other
an&s;wer was made to their addre&s;s. The archbi&s;hop repli|ed
to their reque&s;t pre&s;ented to the Upper Hou&s;e, con|cerning
the divine right of pre&s;bytery, that the preface to
the form of ordination contamed a declaration of three
orders of mini&s;ters from the times of the apo&s;tles; namely,
<PB N="450" REF="456">
bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts, and deacons, to which they had &s;ub&s;crib|ed:
but he and his brethren conceived, that, without a
royal licence, they had not authority to attempt, enact,
promulge, or execute any canon, which &s;hould concern
either doctrine or di&s;cipline. The Lower Hou&s;e an&s;wered
this declaration in very petulant terms; and the di&s;pute
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted when the Parliament was prorogued. But the&s;e
conte&s;ts produced divi&s;ions through the whole body of
the clergy, who ranged them&s;elves in different factions,
di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of High-church and Low-|church.
The fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Tories: the
other included tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed Revolution principles,
and recommended moderation towards the diffenters.
The High-church party reproached the other as time|&s;ervers,
and pre&s;byterians in di&s;gui&s;e; and were in their
turn &s;tigmati&s;ed as the friends and abettors of tyranny and
per&s;ecution. At pre&s;ent, however, the Tories both in
church and &s;tate triumphed in the favour of their &s;ove|reign.
The right of parliaments, the memory of the late
King, and even the act limiting the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e
of Hanover, became the &s;ubjects of ridicule. The Queen
was flattered as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the prerogatives of the ancient
monarchy: the hi&s;tory written by her grandfather the
Earl of Clarendon was now for the fir&s;t time publi&s;hed,
to inculcate the principles of obedience, and in&s;pire the
people with an abhorrence of oppo&s;ition to an annointed
&s;overeign. Her Maje&s;ty's hereditary right was deduced
from Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, and, as heir of his pretend|ed
&s;anctity and virtue, &s;he was per&s;uaded to touch per|&s;ons
afflicted with the King's evil, according to the office
in&s;erted in the liturgy for this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect; XXX. The change of the mini&s;try in Scotland &s;eemed
favourable to the epi&s;copalians and anti-revolutioners of
that kingdom. The Earls of Marchmont, Melvil, Selkirk,
Leven, and Hyndford were laid a&s;ide: the Earl of Sea|field
was appointed chancellor: the Duke of Queen&s;berry,
and the Lord Vi&s;count Tarbat, were declared &s;ecretaries
of &s;tate: the Marquis of Annandale was made pre&s;ident of
<PB N="451" REF="457">
the council, and the Earl of Tullibardine, lord privy-&s;eal. A
new parliament having been &s;ummoned, the Earl of Seafield
employed his influence &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that a great number
of ant revolutioners was returned as members. The
Duke of Hamilton had obtained from the Queen a letter
to the privy-council in Scotland, in which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed
her de&s;ire, that the pre&s;byterian clergy &s;hould live in bro|therly
love and communion with &s;uch di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters
of the reformed religion as were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of benefices,
and lived with decency, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the law. The
epi&s;copal clergy, encouraged by the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions in their
favour, drew up an addre&s;s to the Queen, imploring her
protection; and humbly befeeching her to allow tho&s;e
pari&s;hes in which there was a majority of epi&s;copal free|holders
to be&s;tow the benefice on mini&s;ters of their prin|ciples.
This petition was pre&s;ented by Dr. Skeen and Dr.
Scot, who were introduced by the Duke of Queen&s;berry
to her Maje&s;ty. She a&s;&s;ured them of her protection and
endeavours to &s;upply their nece&s;&s;ities; and exhorted them
to live in peace and chri&s;tian love with the clergy, who
were by law inve&s;ted with the church government in her
ancient kingdom of Scotland. A proclamation of indemnity
having been publi&s;hed in March, a great number of Jaco|bites
returned from France and other countries, pretend|ed
to have changed their &s;entiments, and took the oaths,
that they might be qualified to &s;it in parliament. They
formed an acce&s;&s;ion to the &s;trength of the anti-revoluti|oners
and epi&s;copalians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Oldmixon. Torcy's Mem. Lamberty's Mem. Feuquieres. $urchet. Tindal. Lockhart's Mem. Lives of the Admirals. Hi&s;t. of the D. of Marl|borough. Duche&s;s of Marlbo|rough's Ap$l</NOTE> who now hoped to out-number the
pre&s;byterians, and outweight their intere&s;t. But this confede|racy
was compo&s;ed of di&s;&s;onant parts, from which no har|mony
could be expected. The pre&s;byterians and Revoluti|oners
were headed by the Duke of Argyle. The country-party
of malcontents, which took its ri&s;e from the di&s;ap|pointments
of the Darien &s;ettlement, acted under the au&s;pic|es
of the Duke of Hamilton and Marquis of Tweedale; and
the Earl of Hume appeared as chief of the anti-revolutioners.
The different parties who now united, pur&s;ued the mo&s;t
oppo&s;ite ends. The majority of the country-party were
<PB N="452" REF="458">
friends to the Revolution, and &s;ought only redre&s;s of the
grievances which the nation had &s;u&s;tained in the late
reign. The anti-revolutioners con&s;idered the acce&s;&s;ion
and government of King William as an extraordinary
event, which they were willing to forget, believing that all
parties were&s;afe under the &s;helter of her Maje&s;ty's general
indemnity. The Jacobites &s;ubmitted to the Queen, as tu|trix
or regent for the Prince of Wales, whom they firmly
believed &s;he intended to e&s;tabli&s;h on the throne. The
Whigs under Argyle, alarmed at the coalition of all their
enemies, re&s;olved to procure a parliamentary fanction for
the Revolution.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXI.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1703.</NOTE> The parliament being opened on the &s;ixth
day of May at Edinburgh, by the Duke of Queen&s;berry
as commi&s;&s;ioner, the Queen's letter was read, in which
&s;he demanded a &s;upply for the maintenance of the forces,
advi&s;ed them to encourage trade, and exhorted them to
proceed with wi&s;dom, prudence, and unanimity. The
Duke of Hamilton immediately offered the draft of a bill
for recognizing her Maje&s;ty's undoubted right and title to
the Imperial crown of Scotland, according to the declara|tion
of the e&s;tates of the kingdom, containing the claim of
right. It was immediately received; and at the &s;econd read|ing,
the Queen's advocate offered an additional clau&s;e, de|nouncing
the penalties of trea&s;on again&s;t any per&s;on who
&s;hould quarrel her Maje&s;ty's right and title to the crown,
or her exerci&s;e of the government, from her actual entry to
the &s;ame. This, after a long and warm debate, was car|ried
by the concurrence of the anti-revolutioners. Then
the Earl of Hume produced the draft of a bill for the &s;up|ply:
immediately after it was read, the Marquis of Twee|dale
made an overture, that before all other bu&s;ine&s;s, the
parliament would proceed to make &s;uch conditions of go|vernment,
and regulations in the con&s;titution of the king|dom,
to take place after the decea&s;e of her Maje&s;ty and
the heirs of her body, as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for the pre|&s;ervation
of their religion and liberty. This overture and
the bill were ordered to lie upon the table; and, in the
<PB N="453" REF="459">
mean time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. VII. 1703.</NOTE> the commi&s;&s;ioner found him&s;elf involved in
great perplexity. The Duke of Argyle, the Marquis of
Annandale, and the Earl of Marchmont, gave him to
under&s;tand in private, that they were re&s;olved to move for
an act, ratifying the Revolution; and for another, con|firming
the pre&s;byterian government: that they would
in&s;i&s;t upon their being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed before the bill of &s;upply,
and that they were certain of carrying the points at which
they aimed. The commi&s;&s;ioner now found him&s;elf re|duced
to a very di&s;agreeable alternative. There was a
nece&s;&s;ity for relinqui&s;hing all hope of a &s;upply, or aban|doning
the anti-revolutioners, to whom he was connected
by promi&s;es of concurrence. The Whigs were determined
to oppo&s;e all &s;chemes of &s;upply that &s;hould come from the
cavaliers: and the&s;e la&s;t re&s;olved to exert their whole power
in preventing the confirmation of the Revolution and the
pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline. He fore&s;aw that on this occa&s;ion
the Whigs would be joined by the Duke of Hamilton and
his party, &s;o as to preponderate again&s;t the cavaliers. He
endeavoured to cajole both parties; but found the ta&s;k
impracticable. He de&s;ired in parliament, that the act for
the &s;upply might be read, promi&s;ing that they &s;hould
have full time afterwards to deliberate on other &s;ubjects.
The Marquis of Tweedale in&s;i&s;ted upon his overture;
and, after warm debates, the Hou&s;e re&s;olved to proceed with
&s;uch acts as might be nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ecuring the religion,
liberty, and trade of the nation, before any bill for &s;upply
or other bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. The Marquis of
Athol offered an act for the &s;ecurity of the kingdom, in
ca&s;e of her Maje&s;ty's decea&s;e: but, before it was read, the
Duke of Argyle pre&s;ented his draft of a bill for ratifying
the Revolution, and all the acts following thereupon. An
act for limiting the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion after the death of her Ma|je&s;ty,
and the heirs of her body, was produced by Mr.
Fletcher, of Saltoun. The Earl of Rothes recommended
another, importing, that after her Maje&s;ty's death, and
failing heirs of her body, no per&s;on coming to the crown
of Scotland, being at the &s;ame time King or Queen of Eng|land,
<PB N="454" REF="460">
&s;hould,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. 1703.</NOTE> as King or Queen of Scotland, have power
to make peace or war without the con&s;ent of parliament.
The Earl of Marchmont recited the draft of an act for
&s;ecuring the true prote&s;tant religion and pre&s;byterian
government: one was al&s;o &s;ugge&s;ted by Sir Patrick John|&s;ton,
allowing the importation of wines, and other foreign
liquors. All the&s;e bills were ordered to lie upon the table.
Then the Earl of Strath more produced an act for toleration
to all prote&s;tants in the exerci&s;e of religious wor&s;hip. But
again&s;t this the general a&s;&s;embly pre&s;ented a mo&s;t violent
remon&s;trance; and the promoters of the bill fore&s;eeing that
it would meet with great oppo&s;ition, allowed it to drop for
the pre&s;ent. On the third day of June, the parliament
pa&s;&s;ed the act for pre&s;erving the true reformed prote&s;tant
religion, and confirming pre&s;byterian church government,
as agreeable to the word of God, and the only government
of Chri&s;t's church within the kingdom. The &s;ame party
enjoyed a further triumph in the &s;ucce&s;s of Argyle's act,
for ratifying and perpetuating the fir&s;t act of King Wil|liam's
parliament; for declaring it high trea&s;on to di&s;own
the authority of that parliament; or to alter or innovate
the claim of right, or any article thereof. This la&s;t clau&s;e
was &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed; but at la&s;t the bill pa&s;&s;ed, with
the concurrence of all the mini&s;try, except the Marquis
of Athol and the Vi&s;count Tarbat, who began at this pe|riod
to corre&s;pond with the oppo&s;ite party.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXII. The cavaliers thinking them&s;elves betrayed
by the Duke of Queen&s;berry, who had a&s;&s;ented to the&s;e
acts, fir&s;t expo&s;tulated with him on his breach of promi&s;e,
and then renounced his intere&s;t, re&s;olving to &s;eparate
them&s;elves from the court, and jointly pur&s;ue &s;uch mea|&s;ures
as might be for the intere&s;t of their party. But of
all the bills that were produced in the cour&s;e of this remark|able
&s;e&s;&s;ion, that which produced the mo&s;t violent alter|cation
was the act of &s;ecurity, calculated to abridge the
prerogative of the crown, limit the &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and throw
a va&s;t additional power into the hands of the parliament.
It was con&s;idered paragraph by paragraph: many additions
<PB N="455" REF="461">
and alterations were propo&s;ed, and &s;ome adopted: inflam|matory
&s;peeches were uttered; bitter &s;arca&s;ms retorted from
party to party; and different votes pa&s;&s;ed on different
clau&s;es. At length, in &s;pite of the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate oppo|&s;ition
from the mini&s;try and the cavaliers, it was pa&s;&s;ed by
a majority of fifty-nine voices. The commi&s;&s;ioner was
importuned to give it the royal a&s;&s;ent; but declined an|&s;wering
their entreaties till the tenth day of September.
Then he made a &s;peech in parliament, giving them to
under&s;tand that he had received the Queen's plea&s;ure, and
was empowered to give the royal a&s;&s;ent to all the acts
voted in this &s;e&s;&s;ion, except to the act for the &s;ecurity of
the kingdom. A motion was made, to &s;ollicit the royal
a&s;&s;ent in an addre&s;s to her Maje&s;ty; but the que&s;tion being
put, it was carried in the negative by a &s;mall majority.
On the &s;ixth day of the &s;ame month, the Earl of March|mont
had produced a bill to &s;ettle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion on the
Hou&s;e of Hanover. At fir&s;t the import of it was not
known; but, when the clerk in reading it mentioned the
Prince&s;s Sophia, the whole Hou&s;e was kindled into a flame.
Some propo&s;ed that the overture &s;hould be burned: others
moved that the Earl might be &s;ent pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle;
and a general di&s;&s;atisfaction appeared in the whole a&s;&s;em|bly.
Not that the majority in parliament were aver&s;e to
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the hou&s;e of Hanover: but they re&s;olved
to avoid a nomination without &s;tipulating conditions; and
they had already provided, in the act of &s;ecurity, that it
&s;hould be high-trea&s;on to own any per&s;on as King or
Queen after her Maje&s;ty's decea&s;e, until he or &s;he &s;hould
take the coronation oath, and accept the terms of the
claim of right, and &s;uch conditions as &s;hould be &s;ettled in
this or any en&s;uing parliament.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIII. Andrew Fletcher, of Saltoun, a man of un|daunted
courage and inflexible integrity, who profe&s;&s;ed
republican principles, and &s;eemed de&s;igned by nature as a
member of &s;ome Grecian commonwealth, after having
ob&s;erved that the nation would be en&s;laved, &s;hould it &s;ub|mit,
either willingly or by commi&s;&s;ion, to the &s;ucce&s;&s;or
<PB N="456" REF="462">
of England, without &s;uch conditions of government as
&s;hould &s;ecure them again&s;t the influence of an Engli&s;h
mini&s;try, offered the draft of an act, importing, That
after the decea&s;e of her Maje&s;ty, without heirs of her
body, no per&s;on being &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the Engli&s;h throne
&s;hould &s;ucceed to the crown of Scotland, but under the
following limitations, which, together with the corona|tion-oath
and claim of right, they &s;hould &s;wear to ob&s;erve:
namely, That all offices and places, civil and military, as
well as pen&s;ions, &s;hould for the future be conferred by a par|liament
to be cho&s;en at every Michaelmas head-court, to
&s;it on the fir&s;t day of November, and adjourn them&s;elves
from time to time, till the en&s;uing Michaelmas: That
they &s;hould choo&s;e their own pre&s;ident: That a com|mittee
of &s;ix-and-thirty members, cho&s;en out of the
whole parliament, without di&s;tinction of e&s;tates, &s;hould,
during the intervals of parliament, be ve&s;ted, under the
King, with the admini&s;tration of the government, act as
his council, be accountable to parliament, and call it
together on extraordinary occa&s;ions. He propo&s;ed that
the &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hould be nominated by the majority; decla|ring
for him&s;elf, that he would rather concur in nomina|ting
the mo&s;t rigid papi&s;t with tho&s;e conditions, than the
true&s;t prote&s;tant without them. The motion was &s;econd|ed
by many members; and though po&s;tponed for the pre|&s;ent,
in favour of an act of trade under the con&s;ideration
of the Hou&s;e, it was afterwards re&s;umed with great
warmth. In vain the Lord-Trea&s;urer repre&s;ented that no
funds were as yet provided for the army, and moved for a
reading of the act pre&s;ented for that purpo&s;e: a certain
member ob&s;erved, that this was a very un&s;ea&s;onable junc|ture
to propo&s;e a &s;upply, when the Hou&s;e had &s;o much to
do for the &s;ecurity of the nation: he &s;aid they had very
little encouragement to grant &s;upplies, when they found
them&s;elves fru&s;trated of all their labour and expen&s;e for
the&s;e &s;everal months; and when the whole kingdom &s;aw
that &s;upplies &s;erved for no other u&s;es but to gratify the
avarice of &s;ome in&s;atiable mini&s;ters. Mr. Fletcher ex|patiated
upon the good con&s;equences that would ari&s;e from
<PB N="457" REF="463">
the act which he had propo&s;ed. The Chancellor an|&s;wered,
That &s;uch an act was laying a &s;cheme for a com|monwealth,
and tending to innovate the con&s;titution of
the monarchy. The mini&s;try propo&s;ed the &s;tate of a vote,
whether they &s;hould fir&s;t give a reading to Fletcher's act,
or to the act of &s;ub&s;idy. The country-party moved that
the que&s;tion might be, &startq;Overtures for &s;ub&s;idies, or over|tures
for liberty.&endq; Fletcher withdrew his act, rather
than people &s;hould pervert the meaning of laudable de|&s;igns.
The Hou&s;e re&s;ounded with the cry of &startq;Liberty
or &s;ub&s;idy.&endq; Bitter invectives were uttered again&s;t the
mini&s;try. One member &s;aid it was now plain the nation
was to expect no other return for their expen&s;e and toil,
than that of being loaded with a &s;ub&s;idy, and being obliged
to bend their necks under the yoke of &s;lavery, which was
prepared for them from that throne: another ob&s;erved,
that as their liberties were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, &s;o the privileges of
parliament were like to be torn from them; but that he
would venture his life in defence of his birthright, and
rather die a free man than live a &s;lave. When the vote
was demanded, and declined by the Commi&s;&s;ioner, the
Earl of Roxburgh declared, that if there was no other way
of obtaining &s;o natural and undeniable a privilege of par|liament,
they would demand it with their &s;words in their
hands. The Commi&s;&s;ioner, fore&s;eeing this &s;pirit of free|dom
and contradiction, had ordered the foot-guards to be
in readine&s;s, and placed a &s;trong guard upon the ea&s;tern
gate of the city. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e precautions, he
ran the ri&s;que of being torn in pieces; and, in this ap|prehen&s;ion,
ordered the Chancellor to inform the Hou&s;e,
that the parliament &s;hould proceed upon overtures for
liberty at their next &s;itting. This promi&s;e allayed the
ferment which had begun to ri&s;e. Next day the members
prepared an overture, implying, That the elective mem|bers
&s;hould be cho&s;en for every &s;eat at the Michaelmas
head-courts: That a parliament &s;hould be held once in
two years at lea&s;t: That the &s;hort adjournments <HI>de die in
diem</HI> &s;hould be made by the parliaments them&s;elves, as in
<PB N="458" REF="464">
England; and That no officer in the army, Cu&s;toms, or
Exci&s;e, nor any gratuitous pen&s;ioner, &s;hould &s;it as an
elective member. The Commi&s;&s;ioner being appri&s;ed of
their proceedings, called for &s;uch acts as he was empowered
to pa&s;s, and having given the royal a&s;&s;ent to them, proro|gued
the parliament to the twelfth day of October<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Though the Queen refu&s;ed to pa&s;s the act of &s;ecurity, the royal a&s;&s;ent was granted to an act of limitation on the &s;ucce&s;&s;or, in which it was declared that no King or Queen of Scotland &s;hould have power to make war or peace without con&s;ent of parliament. Another law was enacted, allowing French wines and other liquors to be imported in neutral bottoms; Without this ex|pedient, it was alledged that the revenue would have been in&s;ufficient to maintain the government. An act pa&s;&s;ed in favour of the company trading to Africa and the Indies; another for a commi&s;&s;ion concerning the publick a$$ounts; a third for puni&s;hing &s;landerous &s;peeches and writings. The com|mi&s;&s;ion for treating of an union with England was vacated, with a prohibition to grant any other commi&s;&s;ion for that purpo&s;e without con&s;ent of parlia|ment; and no &s;upply having been provided before the adjournment, the army and expen&s;e of government were maintained upon credit.</NOTE>.
Such was the i&s;&s;ue of this remarkable &s;e&s;&s;ion of the Scot|ti&s;h
parliament, in which the Duke of Queen&s;berry was
abandoned by the greate&s;t part of the mini&s;try; and &s;uch
a &s;pirit of ferocity and oppo&s;ition pevailed, as threatened
the whole kingdom with civil war and confu&s;ion. The

<P>&sect; XXXIV. Ireland was filled with di&s;content, by the
behaviour and conduct of the tru&s;tees for the forfeited
e&s;tates. The Earl of Roche&s;ter had contributed to foment
the troubles of the kingdom, by encouraging the factions
which had been imported from England. The Duke of
Ormond was received with open arms, as heir to the
<PB N="459" REF="465">
virtues of his ance&s;tors, who had been the bulwarks of the
prote&s;tant intere&s;ts in Ireland. He opened the parliament
on the twenty-fir&s;t day of September, with a &s;peech to both
Hou&s;es, in which he told them, that his inclination, his
intere&s;t, and the examples of his progenitors, were indi&s;|pen&s;ible
obligations upon him, to improve every opportu|nity
to the advantage and pro&s;perity of his native country.
The Commons having cho&s;en Allen Broderick to be their
&s;peaker, proceeded to drawup very affectionate addre&s;&s;es to
the Queen and the Lord-lieutenant. In that to the
Queen they complained, that their enemies had mi&s;repre|&s;ented
them, as de&s;irous of being independent of the crown
of England: they, therefore, to vindicate them&s;elves from
&s;uch fal&s;e a&s;per&s;ions, declared and acknowledged, that the
kingdom of Ireland was annexed and united to the imperial
crown of England. In order to expre&s;s their hatred of
the tru&s;tees, they re&s;olved, That all the prote&s;tant free|holders
of that kingdom had been fa&s;&s;ly and maliciou&s;ly
mi&s;repre&s;ented, traduced, and abu&s;ed, in a book intituled,
&startq;The Report of the commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to enquire
into the Iri&s;h forfeitures;&endq; and it appearing that Francis
Anne&s;ley, member of the Hou&s;e, John Trenchard, Henry
Langford, and James Hamilton, were authors of that
book, they further re&s;olved, That the&s;e per&s;ons had &s;canda|lou&s;ly
and maliciou&s;ly mi&s;repre&s;ented and traduced the
prote&s;tant freeholders of that kingdom, and endeavoured
to create a mi&s;under&s;tanding and jealou&s;y between the
people of England and the prote&s;tants of Ireland. Anne&s;ley
was expelled the Hou&s;e, Hamilton was dead, and Trenchard
had returned to England. They had fini&s;hed the enquiry
before the meeting of this parliament; and &s;old, at an under
value, the be&s;t of the forfeited e&s;tates to the &s;word-blade
company of England. This, in a petition to the Iri&s;h
parliament, prayed that heads of a bill be brought in for
enabling them to take conveyances of lands in Ireland:
but the parliament was very little di&s;po&s;ed to confirm the
bargains of the tru&s;tees, and the petition lay neglected on
the table. The Hou&s;e expelled John A&s;gill, who, as
<PB N="460" REF="466">
agent to the &s;word-blade company, had offered to lend
money to the publick in Ireland, on condition that the
parliament would pa&s;s an act to confirm the company's
purcha&s;e of the forfeited e&s;tates. His con&s;tituents di&s;owned
his propo&s;al; and when he was &s;ummoned to appear
before the Hou&s;e, and an&s;wer for his prevarication, he
pleaded his privilege, as member of the Engli&s;h parliament.
The Commons, in a repre&s;entation of the &s;tate and
grievances of the nation, gave her Maje&s;ty to under&s;tand,
that the con&s;titution of Ireland had been of late greatly
&s;haken; and their lives, liberties, and e&s;tates called in
que&s;tion, and tried in a manner unknown to their ance&s;tors;
that the expen&s;e to which they had been unnece&s;&s;arily ex|po&s;ed
by the late tru&s;tees for the forfeited e&s;tates, in de|fending
their ju&s;t rights and titles, had exceeded in value
the current ca&s;h of the kingdom: that their trade was de|cayed,
their money exhau&s;ted; and that they were hin|dered
from maintaining their own manufactures: that
many prote&s;tant families had been con&s;trained to quit the
kingdom, in order to earn a livelihood in foreign countries:
that the want of frequent parliaments in Ireland had encou|raged
evil-minded men to oppre&s;s the &s;ubject: that many
civil officers had acquired great fortunes in that impoveri&s;h|ed
country, by the exerci&s;e of corruption and oppre&s;&s;ion:
that others, in con&s;iderable employments, re&s;ided in ano|ther
kingdom, neglecting per&s;onal attendance on their duty,
while their offices were ill executed, to the detriment of
the publick, and the failure of ju&s;tice. They declared,
that it was from her Maje&s;ty's gracious interpo&s;ition alone
they propo&s;ed to them&s;elves relief from tho&s;e their mani|fold
groans and misfortunes. The Commons afterwards
voted the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, and granted one hundred
and fifty thou&s;and pounds to make good the deficiencies
of the nece&s;&s;ary branches of the e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXV. They appointed a committee to in&s;pect the
publick accounts, by which they di&s;covered, that above
one hundred thou&s;and pounds had been fal&s;ly charged as
a debt upon the nation. The committee was thanked by the
<PB N="461" REF="467">
Hou&s;e for having &s;aved this &s;um, and ordered to examine
what per&s;ons were concerned in &s;uch a mi&s;repre&s;entation,
which was generally imputed to tho&s;e who acted under the
Duke of Ormond. He him&s;elf was a nobleman of honour
and genero&s;ity, addicted to plea&s;ure, and fond of popular
applau&s;e: but he was &s;urrounded by people of more &s;ordid
principles, who had ingratiated them&s;elves into his confi|dence
by the arts of adulation. The Commons voted a
provi&s;ion for the half-pay officers; and aboli&s;hed pen&s;ions
to the amount of &s;eventeen thou&s;and pounds a year, as
unnece&s;&s;ary branches of the e&s;tabli&s;hment. They pa&s;&s;ed
an act &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown, after the pattern
&s;et them by England: but the mo&s;t important tran&s;action
of this &s;e&s;&s;ion was a &s;evere bill to prevent the growth of
popery. It bore a &s;trong affinity to that which had pa&s;&s;ed
three years before in England; but contained more effectual
clau&s;es. Among others, it enacted, That all e&s;tates of
papi&s;ts &s;hould be equally divided among the children, not|with&s;tanding
any &s;ettlement to the contrary, unle&s;s the
per&s;ons to whom they might be &s;ettled &s;hould qualify
them&s;elves by taking the oaths, and communicating with
the church of England. The bill was not at all agreeable to
the mini&s;try in England, who expected large pre&s;ents from
the papi&s;ts, by whom a con&s;iderable &s;um had been actually
rai&s;ed for this purpo&s;e. But, as they did not think proper
to reject &s;uch a bill while the Engli&s;h parliament was &s;it|ting,
they added a clau&s;e which they hoped the parliament of
Ireland would refu&s;e; namely, that no per&s;ons in that
kingdom &s;hould be capable of any employment, or of
being in the magi&s;tracy of any city, who did not qualify
them&s;elves by receiving the &s;acrament, according to the
te&s;t-act pa&s;&s;ed in England. Though this was certainly
a great hard&s;hip on the di&s;&s;enters, the parliament of
Ireland &s;acrificed this con&s;ideration to their common
&s;ecurity again&s;t the Roman catholicks, and accepted
the amendment without he&s;itation. This affair being
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the Commons of Ireland pa&s;&s;ed a vote again&s;t
a book intituled, &startq;Memoirs of the late King James II.&endq;
<PB N="462" REF="468">
as a &s;editious libel. They ordered it to be burned by the
hands of the common hangman; and the book&s;eller and
printer to be pro&s;ecuted. When this motion was made,
a member informed the Hou&s;e, that in the county of
Limerick, the Iri&s;h papi&s;ts had begun to form them&s;elves
into bodies; to plunder the prote&s;tants of their arms and
money; and to maintain a corre&s;pondence with the di&s;|affected
in England. The Hou&s;e immediately re&s;olved,
That the papi&s;ts of the kingdom &s;till retained hopes of
the acce&s;&s;ion of the per&s;on known by the name of the
Prince of Wales in the life-time of the late King James,
and now by the name of James III. In the mid&s;t of this
zeal again&s;t popery and the Pretender, they were &s;udden|ly
adjourned by the command of the Lord-lieutenant,
and broke up in great animo&s;ity again&s;t that nobleman<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">They had, be&s;ides the bills already mentioned, pa&s;&s;ed an act for an addi|tional Exci&s;e on beer, ale, and other liquors: another encouraging the im|portation of iron and &s;laves: a third for preventing popi&s;h prie&s;ts from com|ing into the kingdom: a fourth &s;ecuring the liberty of the &s;ubject, and for prevention of impri&s;onment beyond &s;eas; and a fifth for naturalizing all pro|te&s;tant &s;trangers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVI. The attention of the Engli&s;h mini&s;try had
been for &s;ome time chiefly engro&s;&s;ed by the affairs of the
continent. The Emperor agreed with the allies, that
his &s;on the Archduke Charles &s;hould a&s;&s;ume the title of
King of Spain, demand the Infanta of Portugal in mar|riage,
and undertake &s;omething of importance, with the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the maritime powers. Mr. Methuen, the
Engli&s;h mini&s;ter at Li&s;bon, had already made &s;ome progre&s;s
in a treaty with his Portugue&s;e Maje&s;ty; and the court of
Vienna promi&s;ed to &s;end &s;uch an army into the field as
would in a little time drive the Elector of Bavaria from
his dominions. But they were &s;o dilatory in their pre|parations,
that the French King broke all their mea|&s;ures,
by &s;ending powerful re-enforcements to the Elector,
in who&s;e ability and attachment Louis repo&s;ed great
confidence. Mare&s;chal Villars, who commanded an army
of thirty thou&s;and men at Stra&s;burg, pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine,
and reduced fort K$hl, the garri&s;on of which was con|ducted
<PB N="463" REF="469">
to Philip&s;burgh. The Emperor, alarmed at this
event, ordered Count Schlick to enter Bavaria on the
&s;ide of Salt&s;burg, with a con&s;iderable body of forces;
and &s;ent another under Count Stirum, to invade the &s;ame
electorate by the way of Newmark, which was &s;urren|dered
to him, after he had routed a party of Bavarians:
the city of Amberg met with the &s;ame fate. Mean while
Count Schlick defeated a body of militia that defended
the lines of Salt&s;burg, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Riedt,
and &s;everal other places. The Elector a&s;&s;embling his
forces near Brenau, diffu&s;ed a report that he intended to
be&s;iege Pa&s;&s;au, to cover which place Schlick advanced
with the greate&s;t part of his infantry, leaving behind his
cavalry and cannon. The Elector having by this feint
divided the Imperiali&s;ts, pa&s;&s;ed the bridge of Scardingen
with twelve thou&s;and men, and, after an ob&s;tinate en|gagement,
compelled the Imperiali&s;ts to abandon the field
of battle: then he marched again&s;t the Saxon troops
which guarded the artillery, and attacked them with &s;uch
impetuo&s;ity, that they were entirely defeated. In a few
days after the&s;e actions, he took Newburg on the Inn by
capitulation. He obtained another advantage over an ad|vanced
po&s;t of the Imperiali&s;ts near Burgenfeldt, com|manded
by the young Prince of Brandenburg An&s;pach,
who was mortally wounded in the engagement. He ad|vanced
to Rati&s;bon, where the diet of the empire was
a&s;&s;embled, and demanded that he &s;hould be immediately
put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bridge and gate of the city. The
burghers immediately took to their arms, and planted
cannon on the ramparts: but when they &s;aw a battery
erected again&s;t them, and the Elector determined to bom|bard
the place, they thought proper to capitulate, and
comply with his demands He took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
town on the eighth day of April, and &s;igned an in&s;trument
obliging him&s;elf to withdraw his troops, as &s;oon as the
Emperor &s;hould ratify the diet's re&s;olution for the neutra|lity
of Rati&s;bon. Mare&s;chal Villars having received
orders to join the Elector at all events, and being re-en|forced
<PB N="464" REF="470">
by a body of troops under Count Tallard, re&s;olved
to break through the lines which the Prince of Baden
had made at Stolhoffen. This general had been luckily
joined by eight Dutch battalions, and received the French
army, though double his number, with &s;uch ob&s;tinate re&s;o|lution,
that Villars was obliged to retreat with great lo&s;s,
and directed his route towards Offingen. Neverthele&s;s,
he penetrated through the Black Fore&s;t, and effected a
junction with the Elector. Count Stirum endeavoured
to join Prince Louis of Baden: but being attacked near
Schwemmingen, retired under the cannon of Nortlingen.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVII. The confederates were more &s;uce&s;sful on
the Lower Rhine and in the Netherlands. The Duke of
Marlborough cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea in the beginning of April,
and a&s;&s;embling the allied army, re&s;olved that the cam|paign
&s;hould be begun with the &s;iege of Bonne, which
was accordingly inve&s;ted on the twenty-fourth day of
April. Three different attacks were carried on again&s;t
this place; one by the Hereditary Prince of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el;
another by the celebrated Coehorn; and a third by
Lieutenant-General Fagel. The garri&s;on defended them|&s;elves
vigorou&s;ly till the fourteenth day of May, when
the fort having been taken by a&s;&s;ault, and the breaches
rendered practicable, the Marquis d'Alegre, the gover|nor,
ordered a parley to be beat: ho&s;tages were immedi|ately
exchanged: on the &s;ixteenth the capitulation was
&s;igned; and in three days the garri&s;on evacuated the place,
in order to be conducted to Luxemburg. During the
&s;iege of Bonne, the Mare&s;chals Boufflers and Villeroy ad|vanced
with an army of forty thou&s;and men towards
Tongeren, and the confederate army commanded by
M. D'Auverquerque was obliged at their approach to retreat
under the cannon of Ma$&s;trich. The enemy having
taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Tongeren, made a motion again&s;t the
confederate army, which they found already drawn up in
order of battle, and &s;o advantageou&s;ly po&s;ted, that not|with&s;tanding
their great &s;uperiority in point of number,
they would not hazard an attack; but retired to the ground
<PB N="465" REF="471">
from whence they had advanced. Immediately after the
reduction of Bonne, the Duke of Marlborough, who had
been pre&s;ent at the &s;iege, returned to the confederate army
in the Netherlands, now amounting to one hundred and
thirty &s;quadrons, and fifty-nine battalions. On the twen|ty-fifth
day of May; the Duke having pa&s;&s;ed the river
Jecker, in order to give battle to the enemy, they marched
with precipitation to Boekwern, and abandoned Tonge|ren,
after having blown up the walls of the place with
gunpowder. The Duke continued to follow them to
Thys, where he encamped, while they retreated to Han|nye,
retiring as he advanced. Then he re&s;olved to force
their lines: this &s;ervice was effectually performed by
Coehorn, at the point of Callo, and by Baron Spaar, in
the county of Waes, near Stoken. The Duke had formed
the de&s;ign of reducing Antwerp, which was garri&s;oned
by Spani&s;h troops, under the command of the Marquis
de Bedmar. He intended with the grand army to attack
the enemy's lines on the &s;ide of Louvaine and Mechlin:
he detached Coehorn with his flying camp on the right
of the Scheldt, towards Dutch Flanders, to amu&s;e the
Marquis de Bedmar on that &s;ide; and he ordered the
Baron Opdam, with twelve thou&s;and men, to take po&s;t
between Eckeren and Capelle, near Antwerp, that he
might act again&s;t that part of the lines which was guard|ed
by the Spani&s;h forces.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXVIII. The French generals, in order to fru&s;|trate
the &s;cheme of Marlborough, re&s;olved to cut off the
retreat of Opdam. Boufflers, with a detachment of twenty
thou&s;and men from Villeroy's army, &s;urpri&s;ed him at
Eckeren, where the Dutch were put in di&s;order; and
Opdam, believing all was lo&s;t, $led to Breda. Neverthe|le&s;s,
the troops rallying under General Schlangenburg,
maintained their ground with the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate valour,
till night, when the enemy was obliged to retire, and left
the communication free with fort Lillo, to which place
the confederates marched without further mole&s;tation, ha|ving
lo&s;t about fifteen hundred men in the engagement. The
<PB N="466" REF="472">
damage &s;u&s;tained by the French was more con&s;iderable.
They were fru&s;trated in their de&s;ign, and had actually
abandoned the field of battle: yet Louis ordered <HI>T$ Deum</HI>
to be &s;ung for the victory: neverthele&s;s, Boufflers was
cen&s;ured for his conduct on this occa&s;ion, and in a little
time totally di&s;graced. Opdam pre&s;ented a ju&s;tification
of his conduct to the States-General: but by this over|&s;ight
he forfeited the fruits of a long &s;ervice, during which
he had exhibited repeated proofs of courage, zeal, and
capacity. The States honoured Schlangenburg with a
letter of thanks for the valour and &s;kill he had manife&s;ted
in this engagement: but, in a little time, they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him
from his employment, on account of his having given
umbrage to the Duke of Marlborough, by cen&s;uring his
grace for expo&s;ing &s;uch a &s;mall number of men to this
di&s;a&s;ter. After this action, Villeroy, who lay encamped
near St. Job, declared he would wait for the Duke of
Marlborough, who forthwith advanced to Hoog&s;traat,
with a view to give him battle: but, at his approach, the
French general, &s;etting fire to his camp, retired within his
lines with great precipitation. Then the Duke inve&s;ted
Huy, the garri&s;on of which, after a vigorous defence, &s;ur|rendered
them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war, on the twenty-|&s;eventh
day of Augu&s;t. At a council of war held in the
camp of the confederates, the Duke propo&s;ed to attack
the enemy's lines between the Mehaigne and Leuwe, and
was &s;econded by the Dani&s;h, Hanoverian, and He&s;&s;ian
generals: but the &s;cheme was oppo&s;ed by the Dutch
officers, and the deputies of the States, who alledged, that
the &s;ucce&s;s was dubious, and the con&s;equences of forcing
the lines would be incon&s;iderable: they, therefore, recom|mended
the &s;iege of Limburg, by the reduction of which
they would acquire a whole province, and cover their own
country, as well as Juliers and Gueldres, from the de&s;igns
of the enemy. The &s;iege of Limburg was accordingly
undertaken. The trenches were opened on the five-and-twentieth
day of September, and in two days the place was
&s;urrendered; the garri&s;on remaining pri&s;oners of war. By
<PB N="467" REF="473">
this conque&s;t the allies &s;ecured the country of Liege, and
the electorate of Cologn, from the incur&s;ions of the ene|my:
before the end of the year, they remained ma&s;ters of
the whole Spani&s;h Guelderland, by the reduction of
Gueldres, which &s;urrendered on the &s;eventeenth day of
September, after having been long blockaded, bombarded,
and reduced to a heap of a&s;hes, by the Pru&s;&s;ian general,
Lottum. Such was the campaign in the Netherlands,
which in all probability would have produced events of
greater importance, had not the Duke of Marlborough
been re&s;tricted by the deputies of the States-General,
who began to be influenced by the intrigues of the Lou|ve&s;te
in faction, ever aver&s;e to a &s;ingle dictator.</P>
<P>&sect; XXXIX. The French King redoubled his efforts in
Germany. The Duke de Vendome was ordered to march
from the Milane&s;e to Tyrol, and there join the Elector of
Bavaria, who had already made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of In|&s;pruck.
But the boors ri&s;ing in arms, drove him out of
the country before he could be joined by the French gene|ral,
who was, therefore, obliged to return to the Milane&s;e.
The Imperiali&s;ts in Italy were &s;o ill &s;upplied by the court
of Vienna, that they could not pretend to act offen&s;ively.
The French inve&s;ted O&s;tiglia, which, however, they
could not reduce: but the &s;ortre&s;s of Bar&s;illo, in the
duchy of Reggio, capitulating after a long blockade, they
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Duke of Modena's country. The
Elector of Bavaria rejoining Villars, re&s;olved to attack
Count Stirum, whom Prince Louis of Baden had detached
from his army. With this view, they pa&s;&s;ed the Danube
at Donawert, and di&s;charged &s;ix guns, as a &s;ignal for the
Marquis D'U&s;&s;on, whom they had le&s;t in the camp at
Lavingen, to &s;all upon the rear of the Imperiali&s;ts, while
they &s;hould charge them in front Stirum no &s;ooner per|ceived
the &s;ignal, than he gue&s;&s;ed the intention of the
enemy, and in&s;tantly re&s;olved to attack D'U&s;&s;on before the
Elector and the mar$&s;chal &s;hould advance. He, accord|ingly,
charged him at the head of &s;ome &s;elect &s;quadrons,
with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that the French cavalry were
<PB N="468" REF="474">
totally defeated; and all his infantry would have been
killed and taken, had not the Elector and Villars come up
in time to turn the fate of the day. The action continued
from &s;ix in the morning till four in the afternoon, when
Stirum being overpowered by numbers, was obliged to retreat
to Norlingen, with the lo&s;s of twelve thou&s;and men, and
all his baggage and artillery. In the mean time, the Duke
of Burgundy, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Tallard, undertook the &s;iege of
Old Bri&s;ac, with a prodigious train of artillery. The place
was very &s;trongly fortified, though the garri&s;on was &s;mall,
and ill provided with nece&s;&s;aries. In fourteen days, the
governor &s;urrendered the place, and was condemned to
lo&s;e his head, for having made &s;uch a &s;lender defence. The
Duke of Burgundy returned in triumph to Ver&s;ailles, and
Tallard was ordered to inve&s;t Landau. The Prince of
He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el being detached from the Netherlands, for
the relief of the place, joined the Count of Na&s;&s;au-Weil|bourg,
general of the Palatine forces, near Spires, where
they re&s;olved to attack the French in their lines. But by
this time Mon&s;. Pracontal, with ten thou&s;and men, had
joined Tallard, and enabled him to &s;trike a &s;troke which
proved decei&s;ive. He &s;uddenly quitted his lines, and &s;ur|pri&s;ed
the Prince at Spirebach, where the French obtained
a complete victory, after a very ob&s;tinate and bloody en|gagement,
in which the Prince of He&s;&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf
by uncommon marks of courage and pre&s;ence of mind.
Three hor&s;es were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively killed under him, and he
flew a French officer with his own hand. After incredible
efforts, he was fain to retreat with the lo&s;s of &s;ome thou|&s;ands.
The French paid dear for their victory, Pracon|tal
having been &s;lain in the action. Neverthele&s;s, they re|&s;umed
the &s;iege, and the place was &s;urrendered by capi|tulation.
The campaign in Germany was fini&s;hed with
the reduction of Aug&s;burg by the Elector of Bavaria, who
took it in the month of December, and agreed to its being
&s;ecured by a French garri&s;on.</P>
<P>&sect; XL. The Emperor's affairs at this juncture wore a
very unpromi&s;ing a&s;pect. The Hungarians were fleeced,
<PB N="469" REF="475">
and barbarou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed, by tho&s;e to whom he entru&s;ted
the government of their country. They derived courage
from de&s;pair. They &s;ei&s;ed this opportunity, when the
Emperor's forces were divided, and his councils di|&s;tracted,
to exert them&s;elves in defence of their liberties.
They ran to arms, under the au&s;pices of Prince Ragotzki.
They demanded that their grievances &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed,
and their privileges re&s;tored. Their re&s;entment was kept
up by the emi&s;&s;aries of France and Bavaria, who likewi&s;e
encouraged them to per&s;evere in their revolt, by repeated
promi&s;es of protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Emperor's
pro&s;pect, however, was &s;oon mended, by two incidents
of very great con&s;equence to his intere&s;t. The Duke of
Savoy, fore&s;eeing how much he &s;hould lie expo&s;ed to the
mercy of the French King, &s;hould that monarch become
ma&s;ter of the Milane&s;e, engaged in a &s;ecret negociation
with the Emperor, which, notwith&s;tanding all his caution,
was di&s;covered by the court of Ver&s;ailles. Louis immedi|ately
ordered the Duke de Vendome to di&s;arm the troops
of Savoy that were in his army, to the number of two-and-twenty
thou&s;and men: to in&s;i&s;t upon the Duke's
putting him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of four con&s;iderable fortre&s;&s;es;
and demand that the number of his troops &s;hould be re|duced
to the e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;tipulated in the treaty of 1696.
The Duke, exa&s;perated at the&s;e in&s;ults, ordered the
French amba&s;&s;ador, and &s;everal officers of the &s;ame na|tion,
to be arre&s;ted. Louis endeavoured to intimidate
him by a menacing letter, in which he gave him to under|&s;tand,
that &s;ince neither religion, honour, intere&s;t, nor
alliances, had been able to influence his conduct, the
Duke de Vendome &s;hould make known the intentions of
the French monarch, and allow him four-and-twenty
hours to deliberate on the mea&s;ures he &s;hould pur&s;ue.
This letter was an&s;wered by a manife&s;to: in the mean
time, the Duke concluded a treaty with the court of
Vienna; acknowledged the Archduke Charles as King
of Spain; and &s;ent envoys to England and Holland.
<PB N="470" REF="476">
Queen Anne, knowing his importance, as well as his
&s;elfi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition, a&s;&s;ured him of her friend&s;hip and
a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and both &s;he and the States &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors
to Turin. He was immediately joined by a body of Im|perial
hor&s;e under Vi&s;conti, and afterwards by Count
Staremberg, at the head of fifteen thou&s;and men, with
whom that general marched from the Modene&s;e, in the
wor&s;t &s;ea&s;on of the year, through an enemy's country,
and roads that were deemed impa&s;&s;able. In vain the
French forces harra&s;&s;ed him in his march, and even &s;ur|rounded
him in many different places on the route: he
&s;urmounted all the&s;e difficulties with incredible courage
and per&s;everance, and joined the Duke of Savoy at Ca|nelli,
&s;o as to &s;ecure the country of Piedmont. The other
incident which proved &s;o favourable to the Imperial inte|re&s;t,
was a treaty by which the King of Portugal acceded
to the grand alliance. His mini&s;try perceived, that &s;hould
Spain be once united to the crown of France, their ma&s;ter
would &s;it very in&s;ecure upon his throne. They were in|timidated
by the united fleets of the maritime powers,
which maintained the empire of the &s;ea; and they were
allured by the &s;plendour of a match between their infanta
and the Archduke Charles, to whom the Emperor and
the King of the Romans promi&s;ed to transfer all their
preten&s;ions to the Spani&s;h crown. By this treaty, con|cluded
at Li&s;bon, between the Emperor, the Queen of
Great-Britain, the King of Portugal, and the States-General,
it was &s;tipulated, That King Charles &s;hould
be conveyed to Portugal by a powerful $leet, having
on board twelve thou&s;and &s;oldiers, with a great &s;upply
of money, arms, and ammunition; and that he &s;hould be
joined immediately upon his landing by an army of eight-and-twenty
thou&s;and Portugue&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; XLI. The confederates reaped very little advantage
from the naval operations of this &s;ummer. Sir George
Rooke crui&s;ed in the channel, in order to alarm the coa&s;t
of France, and protect the trade of England. On the
<PB N="471" REF="477">
fir&s;t day of July, Sir Cloude&s;ley Shovel &s;ailed from St.
Helen's, with the combined &s;quadrons of England and
Holland: he directed his cour&s;e to the Mediterranean,
and being reduced to great difficulty by want of water,
&s;teered to Altea, on the coa&s;t of Valentia, where Briga|di$r
Seymour landed, and encamped with five and-twenty
hundred marines. The Admiral publi&s;hed a &s;hort mani|fe&s;to,
&s;ignifying that he was not come to di&s;turb, but to
protect, the good &s;ubjects of Spain, who &s;hould &s;wear al|legiance
to their lawful monarch, the Archduke Charles,
and endeavour to &s;hake off the yoke of France. This
declaration produced little or no effect; and the fleet being
watered, Sir Cloude&s;ley &s;ailed to Leghorn. One de&s;ign of
this armament was to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Cevennois, who had in the
cour&s;e of the preceding year been per&s;ecuted into a revolton
account of religion, and implored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of England
and the States-General. The Admiral detached two &s;hips
into the gulf of Narbonne, with &s;ome refugees and French
pilots, who had concerted &s;ignals with the Cevennois:
but the Mar$&s;chal de Montrevil having received intimation
of their de&s;ign, took &s;uch mea&s;ures as prevented all com|munication;
and the Engli&s;h captains having repeated
their &s;ignals to no purpo&s;e, rejoined Sir Cloude&s;ley at
Leghorn. This admiral, having renewed the peace with
the piratical &s;tates of Barbary, returned to England with|out
having taken one effectual &s;tep for annoying the ene|my,
or attempted any thing that looked like the re&s;ult of
a concerted &s;cheme for that purpo&s;e. The nation naturally
murmured at the fruitle&s;s expedition, by which it had in|curred
&s;uch a con&s;iderable expen&s;e. The merchants com|plained
that they were ill &s;upplied with convoys. The
&s;hips of war were victualled with damaged provi&s;ion; and
every article of the marine being mi&s;managed, the blame
fell upon tho&s;e who acted as council to the lord high-admiral.</P>
<P>&sect; XLII. Nor were the arms of England by &s;ea much
more &s;ucce&s;sful in the We&s;t-Indies. Sir George Rooke,
<PB N="472" REF="478">
in the preceding year, had detached from the Mediter|ranean
Captain Hovenden Walker, with &s;ix &s;hips of the
line and tran&s;ports, having on board four regiments of
&s;oldiers, for the Leeward i&s;lands. Being joined at Anti|gua
by &s;ome troops under Colonel Codrington, they
made a de&s;cent upon the i&s;land of Guadaloupe, where they
rai&s;ed the fort, burned the town, ravaged the country,
and re-embarked with precipitation, in con&s;equence of a
report that the French had landed nine hundred men on
the back of the i&s;land. They retired to Nevis, where
they mu&s;t have peri&s;hed by famine, had not they been pro|videntially
relieved by Vice-Admiral Graydon, in his
way to Jamaica. This officer had been &s;ent out with three
&s;hips to &s;ucceed Benbow, and was convoyed about one
hundred and fifty leagues by two other &s;hips of the
line. He had not &s;ailed many days, when he fell in with
part of the French &s;quadron, commanded by Du Ca&s;&s;e, on
their return from the We&s;t-Indies, very foul, and richly
laden. Captain Cleland, of the Montagu, engaged the
&s;ternmo&s;t; but he was called off by a &s;ignal from the Ad|miral,
who proceeded on his voyage, without taking further
notice of the enemy. When he arrived at Jamaica, he
quarrelled with the principal planters of the i&s;land; and
his &s;hips beginning to be crazy, he re&s;olved to return to
England. He, accordingly, &s;ailed through the gulf of
Florida, with a view to attack the French at Placentia,
in Newfoundland: but his &s;hips were di&s;per&s;ed in a fog
that la&s;ted thirty days; and afterwards the council of war
which he convoked were of opinion that he could not
attack the &s;ettlement with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. At
his return to England, the Hou&s;e of Lords, then &s;itting,
&s;et on foot an enquiry into his conduct. They pre&s;ent|ed
an addre&s;s to the Queen, de&s;iring &s;he would remove
him from his employments; and he was accordingly di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed.
The only exploit that tended to di&s;tre&s;s the ene|my
was performed by Rear-Admiral Dilkes, who, in the
month of July, &s;ailed to the coa&s;t of France with a &s;mall
<PB N="473" REF="479">
&s;quadron; and in the neighbourhood of Granville, took
or de&s;troyed about forty &s;hips and their convoy. Yet this
damage was incon&s;iderable, when compared to that which
the Engli&s;h navy &s;u&s;tained from the dreadful tempe&s;t
that began to blow on the twenty-&s;eventh day of Novem|ber,
accompanied with &s;uch fla&s;hes of lightning and
peals of thunder, as overwhelmed the whole kingdom
with con&s;ternation. The Hou&s;es in London &s;hook from
their foundations, and &s;ome of them falling, buried the
inhabitants in their ruins. The water over-flowed &s;eve|ral
&s;treets, and ro&s;e to a con&s;iderable tide in We&s;tmin|&s;ter-hall.
London-bridge was almo&s;t choaked up with
the wrecks of ve&s;&s;els that peri&s;hed in the river. The lo&s;s
&s;u&s;tained by the capital was computed at a million &s;ter|ling;
and the city of Bri&s;tol &s;uffered to a prodigious
amount: but the chief national damage fell upon the navy.
Thirteen &s;hips of war were lo&s;t, together with fifteen
hundred &s;eamen, including Rear-Admiral Beaumont, who
had been employed in ob&s;erving the Dunkirk &s;quadron,
and was then at anchor in the Downs, where his &s;hip
foundered. This great lo&s;s, however, was repaired with
incredible diligence, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all Europe.
The Queen immediately i&s;&s;ued orders for building a greater
number of &s;hips than that which had been de&s;troyed;
and &s;he exerci&s;ed her bounty for the relief of the &s;hip|wrecked
&s;eamen, and the widows of tho&s;e who were
drowned, in &s;uch a manner as endeared her to all her
&s;ubjects.</P>
<P>&sect; XLIII. The Emperor having declared his &s;econd &s;on
Charles king of Spain, that young prince &s;et out from
Vienna to Holland, and at Du&s;&s;eldorp was vi&s;ited by the
Duke of Marlborough, who, in the name of his mi&s;tre&s;s,
congratulated him upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the crown of
Spain. Charles received him with the mo&s;t obliging
courte&s;y&punc; In the cour&s;e of their conver&s;ation, taking off
his &s;word, he pre&s;ented it to the Engli&s;h general, with a
very gracious a&s;pect, &s;aying, in the French language,
<PB N="474" REF="480">
&startq;I am not a&s;hamed to own my&s;elf a poor prince. I
po&s;&s;e&s;s nothing but my cloak and &s;word; the latter
may be of u&s;e to your Grace; and I hope you will
not think it the wor&s;e for my wearing it one day.&endq;
&startq;On the contrary (replied the Duke) it will always put
me in mind of your Maje&s;ty's ju&s;t right and title, and
of the obligations I lie under to hazard my life in mak|ing
you the greate&s;t prince in Chri&s;te$dom.&endq;&mdash;This
nobleman returned to England in October; and King
Charles embarking for the &s;ame kingdom, under convoy
of an Engli&s;h and Dutch &s;quadron, arrived at Spithead
on the twenty-&s;ixth day of September. There he was
received by the Dukes of Somer&s;et and Marlborough, who
conducted him to Wind&s;or; and on the road he was met
by Prince George of Denmark. The Queen's deport|ment
towards him was equally noble and obliging; and
he expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect and veneration for
this illu&s;trious prince&s;s. He &s;poke but little; yet what
he &s;aid was judicious; and he behaved with &s;uch polite|ne&s;s
and affability as conciliated the affection of the Eng|li&s;h
nobility. After having been magnificently entertain|ed
for three days, he returned to Port&s;mouth, from
thence, on the fourth of January, he &s;ailed for Portu|gal,
with a great &s;leet commanded by Sir George Rooke,
having on board a body of land forces, under the Duke
of Schomberg. When the Admiral had almo&s;t reached
Cape Fini&s;terre, he was driven back by a &s;torm to Spit|head,
where he was obliged to remain till the middle of
February. Then being favoured with a fair wind, he
happily performed the voyage to Li&s;bon, where King
Charles was received with great &s;plendour, though the
court of Portugal was over&s;pread with &s;orrow, excited by
the death of the Infanta, whom the King of Spain in|tended
to e&s;pou&s;e. In Poland, all hope of peace &s;eemed
to vani&s;h. The cardinal-primate, by the in&s;tigation of
the Swedi&s;h king, who&s;e army lay encamped in the
neighbourhood of Dantzick, a&s;&s;embled a diet at War&s;aw,
<PB N="475" REF="481">
which &s;olemnly depo&s;ed Augu&s;tus, and declared the
throne vacant. Their intention was to elect young Sobie&s;|ki,
&s;on of their late monarch, who re&s;ided at Bre&s;law, in
Sile&s;ia; but their &s;cheme was anticipated by Augu&s;tus,
who retired ha&s;tily into his Saxon dominions, and &s;ei&s;ing
Sobie&s;ki, with his brother, &s;ecured them as pri&s;oners at
Dre&s;den.</P>
