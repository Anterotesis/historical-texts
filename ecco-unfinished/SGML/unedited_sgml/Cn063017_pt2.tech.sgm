<P>WHEN I reflect upon that ready conde&s;cen&s;ion, that prevent|ing
genero&s;ity, with which YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS re|ceived
the following poem under your protection; I can alone a&s;crib$
it to the recommendation and influence of the &s;ubject. In you the
cau&s;e and concerns of liberty have &s;o zealous a Patron, as entitles
whatever may have the lea&s;t tendency to promote them, to the di&s;|tinction
of your favour. And who can entertain this delightful re|flection,
without feeling a plea&s;ure far &s;uperior to that of the fonde&s;t
author; and of which all true lovers of their country mu&s;t partici|pate?
To behold the noble&s;t di&s;po&s;itions of the Prince, and of the
Patriot, united: an overflowing benevolence, genero&s;ity, and can|dour
of heart, joined to an enlightened zeal for liberty, an intimate
per&s;ua&s;ion that on it depends the happine&s;s and glory both of King
and People: to &s;ee the&s;e &s;hining out in public virtues, as they have
hitherto &s;miled in all the &s;ocial lights and private accompli&s;hments of

<P>If the following attempt to trace Liberty, from the fir&s;t ages,
down to her excellent e&s;tabli&s;hment in GREAT BRITAIN, can at
all merit your approbation, and prove an entertainment to YOUR
ROYAL HIGHNESS; if it can in any degree an&s;wer the dignity of the
&s;ubject, and of the name under which I pre&s;ume to &s;helter it;
I have my be&s;t reward: particularly, as it affords me an opportunity

<P>THE following Poem is thrown into the form of a
Poetical Vi&s;ion. Its Scene the ruins of ancient
<HI>Rome.</HI> The <HI>GODDESS</HI> of <HI>LIBERTY,</HI> who is &s;uppo&s;ed
to &s;peak thro' the whole, appears, characteri&s;ed as <HI>BRI|TISH
LIBERTY;</HI> to <HI>Ver.</HI> 44. Gives a view of antient
<HI>Italy,</HI> and particularly of Republican <HI>Rome,</HI> in all her
magnificence and glory; to <HI>Ver.</HI> 112. This contra&s;ted
by Modern <HI>Italy;</HI> its valleys, mountains, culture, cities,
people: the difference appearing &s;tronge&s;t in the Capital
City <HI>Rome;</HI> to <HI>Ver.</HI> 234. The ruins of the great works
of <HI>LIBERTY</HI> more magnificent than the borrowed pomp
of <HI>OPPRESSION;</HI> and from them revived <HI>Sculpture,
Painting,</HI> and <HI>Architecture;</HI> to <HI>Ver.</HI> 256. The old <HI>Ro|mans</HI>
apo&s;trophiz'd, with regard to the &s;everal melancho|ly
changes in <HI>Italy: HORACE, TULLY,</HI> and <HI>VIRGIL,</HI>
with regard to their <HI>Tibur, Tu&s;culum,</HI> and <HI>Naples;</HI> to
<HI>Ver.</HI> 287. That once fine&s;t and mo&s;t ornamented part
of <HI>Italy,</HI> all along the Coa&s;t of Baiae, how changed; to
<HI>Ver.</HI> 321. This de&s;olation of <HI>Italy</HI> applied to <HI>Britain;</HI>
to <HI>Ver.</HI> 344. Addre&s;s to the <HI>GODDESS</HI> of <HI>LIBERTY,</HI>
that &s;he would deduce, from the fir&s;t ages, her chief e&s;|tabli&s;hments,
the de&s;cription of which con&s;titute the &s;ub|ject
of the following parts of this Poem. She a&s;&s;ents, and
commands what &s;he &s;ays to be &s;ung in <HI>Britain;</HI> who&s;e
happine&s;s, ari&s;ing from freedom, and a limited monar|chy,
