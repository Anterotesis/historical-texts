<HEAD>EPISTLE
TO
Sir JOHN PRINGLE,
Pre&s;ident of the ROYAL SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few per&s;ons who
rival Sir John Pringle in
my e&s;teem: there are &s;till fewer
who&s;e friend&s;hip I value more. It
is not, however, my purpo&s;e in this
letter, to proclaim the&s;e things to
the world; for what concern has
the world with private connec|tions?
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
Ambition to have the
patronage of the Royal Society
to this work, is my motive for
addre&s;&s;ing you in this public man|ner.
The plan it recommends,
has been my guide many years;
and &s;ucce&s;s has left me no doubt
of its &s;olidity. Your &s;anction,
my friend, will en&s;ure it a gra|cious
reception, from a body of
learned men, who have di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
your literary merit by the
greate&s;t honour they have to be|&s;tow.
It is my &s;ervent de&s;ire to
be u&s;eful to my country: the
&s;tamp of that illu&s;trious Society,
will give a currency to the work:
<PB N="v" REF="4">
every one will read; and every
&s;en&s;ible farmer will profit by it.</P>
<P>Agriculture ju&s;tly claims to be
the chief of arts: it enjoys be&s;ide
the &s;ignal pre-eminence, of com|bining
deep philo&s;ophy with u&s;e|ful
practice. The members of
your Society, cannot employ their
talents more profitably for their
country, or more honourably for
them&s;elves, than in promoting and
improving an art, to which Bri|tain
fundamentally is indebted for
the figure it makes all the world
over.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">
The theory here &s;ugge&s;ted, is
in &s;ome mea&s;ure new: it belongs
to the Royal Society to deter|mine,
whether it be founded on
&s;olid principles. It will give me
entire &s;atisfaction, to be counte|nanced
by a Society, which has
contributed more to promote na|tural
knowledge, than any other
&s;ociety exi&s;ting, or that ever did
exi&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>BEHOLD another volume on hu&s;bandry! ex|claims
a peevi&s;h man on &s;eeing the title|page:
how long &s;hall we be pe&s;tered with &s;uch
trite &s;tuff? &startq;As long, &s;weet Sir, as you are
willing to pay for it: hold out your pur&s;e, and
wares will never be wanting.&endq;</P>
<P>It mu&s;t indeed be acknowledged, that the com|merce
of books is carried on with no great degree
of candour: tho&s;e of hu&s;bandry, with very little.
A book&s;eller contrives a new title, collects books
upon the &s;ubject, delivers them to his author to
pick and cull; and, &startq;Here, Sir, is a &s;pick and
&s;pan new work, full of curious matter.&endq; A|griculture
is the prime of arts: every thing is
made welcome on that &s;ubject; and provided the
title be new, it is to the book&s;eller of no great
importance, how threadbare the contents be.</P>
<P>Writers on agriculture, very few excepted,
deliver their precepts from a &s;tudy lined with
books, without even pretending to experience.
Principles and propo&s;itions are a&s;&s;umed on the au|thority
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
of former writers: opinions pa&s;s current
from generation to generation; and no per&s;on
enquires whether they wear the livery of truth.
Take the following &s;hort &s;pecimen, drawn from a
&s;ingle head, that of manures. Writers talk learn|edly
of lime, &s;tone-marl, clay-marl, &s;hell-marl,
and of other manures; and foretell how they will
operate upon &s;oil, with the &s;ame a&s;&s;urance as if
they could penetrate into their nature and e&s;&s;ence.
&startq;Clay-marl,&endq; &s;ay they, &startq;has more power to
de&s;troy acids and to produce &s;alts, than &s;tone-marl:
<HI>ergo,</HI> a le&s;s quantity of it upon land is
&s;ufficient. Marl extracts grea&s;e out of woollen
cloth: grea&s;e is a &s;pecies of oil: <HI>ergo,</HI> marl
extracts oil from the air. A greater quantity
of marl is laid on land, than of lime: <HI>ergo,</HI> it
mu&s;t have a greater effect in attracting vege|table
food from the air. Shell-marl found un|der
mo&s;s, is compounded of earth and the al|kaline
&s;alt of rotten wood. Becau&s;e clay is
mixed with &s;and in making brick, that mixture
mu&s;t be an enemy to vegetation. The mixing
earth and lime with dung, makes an excellent
compo&s;t. Rain makes flinty &s;and firmer and
more compact,&endq; &amp;c. &amp;c. Some of the&s;e pro|po&s;itions
are erroneous, &s;ome at be&s;t doubtful.
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
And yet, they are but a few of many propo&s;itions,
boldly a&s;&s;erted by writers, though they would re|quire
the elucidation of a Newton or a Boyle.
So much I will vouch for my&s;elf, that I have not
mentioned a &s;ingle article as certain, but what I
have practi&s;ed many years with &s;ucce&s;s: the in|&s;tructions
contained in this book, are founded on
repeated experiments and diligent ob&s;ervation. If
any particular happens to be mentioned that has
not come under my in&s;pection, the reader is
warned of it. In &s;hort, it will &s;oon be perceived,
that this is not a book&s;eller's production.</P>
<P>The dawn of a manufacture, is irk&s;omely &s;low
in its progre&s;s to broad day. Indocility is difficult
to be overcome: habitual indolence, &s;till more.
The&s;e ob&s;tructions vani&s;h in a manufacturing
country. A boy learns by &s;ight his father's trade,
even before he can ply his little hand about an
in&s;trument. He acquires activity by &s;eeing others
active: he comprehends not what it is to be idle.
This ob&s;ervation is &s;trongly exemplified in agri|culture.
Some years ago, farmers in Scotland
were ignorant and indolent; nothing to be &s;een
but weeds and tra&s;h, not a &s;ingle field in order.
People habituated to &s;uch objects, never once
thought of doing better. Skill in agriculture is
<PB N="x" REF="9">
&s;preading gradually in Scotland; and young peo|ple
acquire &s;ome knowledge by &s;ight, even before
they think of practice. After &s;uch advance, may
we not hope, that our progre&s;s will now be ra|pid;
and that agriculture will &s;oon be as familiar
among us, and as &s;kilfully conducted, as in Eng|land?
May this reflection animate our landed
gentry; and inflame them with a de&s;ire, to ac|quire
riches to them&s;elves and lu&s;tre to their
country.</P>
<P>There certainly never was in Scotland a period,
when good le&s;&s;ons in hu&s;bandry were more &s;ea|&s;onable
than at pre&s;ent. This country, growing
in population, affords not corn &s;ufficient for its in|habitants;
and yet wa&s;te land abounds, which
&s;ome &s;kill and much indu&s;try would fertilize. Is
it not deplorable, that in the be&s;t-cultivated &s;hires,
large patches of land &s;hould produce nothing but
broom and whins, not from barrenne&s;s but from
indolence? Can greater encouragement to in|du&s;try
be wi&s;hed, than a ready market for every
thing the &s;oil produces? how different from the
condition of Scotland, not more than forty years
ago! Can a landholder be employed more pro|fitably
for his country, or more honourably as well
as profitably for him&s;elf, than to rou&s;e emulation
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
among his tenants, by kind treatment, by in&s;truc|tion,
by example, and by premiums? Let him
&s;tudy the rules contained in this little work, all
of them plain and adapted to practice. Let him
convene his tenants once a-year to a hearty meal,
and engage them to follow the&s;e rules. What
if he &s;hould be&s;tow on the de&s;erving, a plough
or a brake of the be&s;t con&s;truction? Land can|not
be improved at a cheaper rate. It was by
&s;uch means, that the late John Cockburn of Or|mi&s;town,
promoted emulation and indu&s;try among
his people. His patriotic zeal was rewarded: he
lived to &s;ee his e&s;tate in a higher degree of culti|vation,
than even to this day is &s;een in any other
part of Scotland. The &s;ame means were employ|ed
more exten&s;ively, by the late Earl of Findla|ter:
the &s;kill and per&s;everance of that nobleman,
rai&s;ed his tenants from a torpid &s;tate, to a &s;urpri|&s;ing
degree of activity; and few can now vie with
them, either for indu&s;try or knowledge. Had o|ther
landlords been equally active, how flouri&s;hing
would agriculture have been in Scotland? Great
&s;ums would annually have been received for corn;
in&s;tead of being imported for ready money, a
commodity that can very ill be &s;pared. The field
is &s;till open: let us join hearts and hands to re|deem
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
time wofully mi&s;pent. I &s;ay again, there
never was in Scotland, a period more favourable
to agriculture than the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Agriculture is a very ancient art. It has been
practi&s;ed every where without intermi&s;&s;ion; but
with very little attention to principles. In &s;tudy|ing
the principles laid down by writers, I found
my&s;elf in a &s;ort of labyrinth, carried to and fro
without any certain direction. After a long cour&s;e
of reading, where there was nothing but dark|ne&s;s
and di&s;crepance, I laid a&s;ide my books, took
heart, and like Des Cartes commenced my in|quiries
with doubting of every thing. I re&s;orted
to the book of nature: I &s;tudied it with atten|tion:
and the &s;econd part of this work contains
the re&s;ult of my inquiries. It is far from my
thoughts, to impo&s;e my opinions upon others: I
pretend only to have reduced the theory of agri|culture
into a &s;ort of &s;y&s;tem, more conci&s;e at
lea&s;t, and more con&s;i&s;tent, than has been done
by other writers. Many eyes are better than
one; and if my theory &s;hall be found erroneous,
the many that have erred before, will &s;erve in
&s;ome mea&s;ure to keep me in countenance. I am
not however afraid of any grofs error. An <HI>im|primatur</HI>
from one of the able&s;t chymi&s;ts of the
<PB N="xiii" REF="12">
pre&s;ent age, has given me &s;ome confidence of be|ing
in the right tract<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dr Black profe&s;&s;or of chymi&s;try in the college of Edinburgh.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have all along &s;tudied brevity, as far as con|&s;i&s;tent
with per&s;picuity; and therefore, have con|fined
my&s;elf to matters, that I know to be of real
u&s;e in practice. I am ambitious to have my plan
followed, becau&s;e &s;ucce&s;sful experience has pro|ved
it to be &s;olid: but I &s;hould not hope for many
readers, if I hazarded the tiring them with unne|ce&s;&s;ary
matters. Varro <HI>de re ru&s;tica,</HI> appears to
be very &s;paring of in&s;truction; but rivals Ari&s;totle
him&s;elf in the &s;ubtilety of his divi&s;ions. &startq;Nunc
dicam agri quibus rebus colantur. Quas res
alii dividunt in duas partes, in homines et admi|nicula
hominum: &s;ine quibus rebus colere non
po&s;&s;unt. Alii in tres partes, in&s;trumenti ge|nus
vocale, et &s;emivocale, et mutum. Vocale,
in quo &s;unt &s;ervi: &s;emivocale, in quo &s;unt bo|ves
$ multum, in quo &s;unt plau&s;tra.&endq; Such
puerile divi&s;ions, may be of u&s;e to &s;well a vo|lume;
but give no in&s;truction, and are extremely
tire&s;ome.</P>
<P>I cannot fini&s;h this preface without warmly re|commending
agriculture to gentlemen of land-e&s;tates;
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">
for who&s;e u&s;e chiefly this work is intend|ed.
In every well-governed &s;tate, agriculture has
been duly honoured. In ancient Per&s;ia, a fe&s;ti|val
was yearly celebrated, in which hu&s;bandmen
were freely admitted to the King's table. &startq;From
your labours, &s;aid the King, we receive our
&s;u&s;tenance; and by us you are protected. Be|ing
mutually nece&s;&s;ary to each other, let us,
like brethren, live together in amity.&endq; The
great emperor of China, performs yearly the ce|remony
of holding the plough, to &s;how that no
man is above being a farmer. The i&s;land Mile|tus,
during many years, had been afflicted with
factions: the government was &s;ettled by &s;ome
wi&s;e men of Paros, a neighbouring i&s;land. The&s;e
men having &s;urveyed the i&s;land, and marked the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of every well-cultivated farm, convo|cated
an a&s;&s;embly of the people, and appoint|ed
the&s;e per&s;ons to be governors. &startq;The per|&s;on,&endq;
&s;aid they, &startq;who governs his pri|vate
affairs with prudence and indu&s;try, is
qualified to govern tho&s;e of the public.&endq; The
king of Tunis, invaded by a powerful enemy,
promi&s;ed to a neighbour who a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, the
philo&s;opher's &s;tone. He &s;ent a plough, &s;aying,
That a plough was virtually the philo&s;opher's
<PB N="xv" REF="14">
&s;tone; for that it would produce rich crops, to
procure gold in plenty.</P>
<P>In the view of profit, agriculture is fit for
every man. But my pre&s;ent view is to re|commend
it, as of all occupations the mo&s;t pro|per
for gentlemen in a private &s;tation. Mat|ter
crouds upon me; and I am at a lo&s;s where
to begin. Agriculture corre&s;ponds to that degree
of exerci&s;e, which is the be&s;t pre&s;ervative of
health. It requires no hurtful fatigue, on the one
hand, nor indulges, on the other, indolence,
&s;till more hurtful. During a throng of work, the
diligent farmer will &s;ometimes be early and late
in the field: but this is no hard&s;hip upon an ac|tive
&s;pirit. At other times, a gentleman who
conducts his affairs properly, may have hours e|very
day, to be&s;tow on reading, on his family, on
his friends.</P>
<P>Agriculture is equally &s;alutary to the mind. In
the management of a farm, con&s;tant attention is
required to the &s;oil, to the &s;ea&s;on, and to differ|ent
operations. A gentleman thus occupied, be|comes
daily more active, and is daily gathering
knowledge: as his mind is never &s;uffered to lan|gui&s;h,
he is &s;ecure again&s;t the di&s;ea&s;e of low
&s;pirits.</P>
<P>But what I chiefly in&s;i&s;t on is, that laying a&s;ide
<PB N="xvi" REF="15">
irregular appetites and ambitious views, agricul|ture
is of all occupations the mo&s;t con&s;onant to
our nature; and the mo&s;t productive of content|ment,
the &s;weete&s;t &s;ort of happine&s;s. In the fir&s;t
place, it requires that moderate degree of exer|ci&s;e,
which corre&s;ponds the mo&s;t to the ordinary
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of our perceptions. Fox-hunting pro|duces
a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion too rapid: angling produces a
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion too &s;low. Agriculture corre&s;ponds not
only more to the ordinary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but has the
following &s;ignal property, that the farmer can di|rect
his operations, with that degree of quickne&s;s
and variety, which is the be&s;t &s;uited to his own
train of perceptions. In the next place, to every
occupation that can give a la&s;ting reli&s;h, hope and
fear are e&s;&s;ential. A fowler has little enjoyment
in his gun, who mi&s;&s;es frequently; and he lo&s;es
all enjoyment, when every &s;hot is death: a
poacher, &s;o dextrous, may have plea&s;ure in the
profit, but none in the art. The hopes and fears
that attend agriculture, keep the mind always a|wake,
and in an enlivening degree of agitation.
Hope never approache certainty &s;o near, as to
produce &s;ecurity; nor is fear ever &s;o great, as to
create deep anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s. Hence it is,
that a gentleman farmer, tolerably &s;kilful, never
<PB N="xvii" REF="16">
tires of his work; but is as keen the la&s;t moment
as the fir&s;t. Can any other employment compare
with farming in that re&s;pect? In the third place,
no other occupation rivals agriculture, in connect|ing
private intere&s;t with that of the public. How
plea&s;ing to think, that every &s;tep a man makes
for his own good, promotes that of his country!
Even where the balance happens to turn again&s;t
the farmer, he has &s;till the comfort that his country
profits by him. Every gentleman-farmer mu&s;t of
cour&s;e be a patriot; for patrioti&s;m, like other vir|tues,
is improved and fortified by exerci&s;e. In
fact, if there be any remaining patrioti&s;m in a na|tion,
it is found among that cla&s;s of men.</P>
<P>A gentleman-farmer who is di&s;po&s;ed to embel|li&s;h
his fields, has a great advantage over others.
He can execute that plea&s;ing work at the cheape&s;t
rate, by employing upon it his farm &s;ervants and
cattle, every vacant hour. This &s;low method is
indeed ill &s;uited to the ardour of an Indian Na|bob,
impatient for enjoyment. But is not the
advantage clearly on the &s;ide of the farmer? The
refined plea&s;ure of embelli&s;hments, ari&s;es from a
&s;low progre&s;s; which affords lei&s;ure to fea&s;t the
eye upon every new production.</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="17">
In former times, hunting was the only bu&s;ine&s;s
of a gentleman. The practice of blood made him
rough and hard-hearted: he led the life of a dog,
or of a &s;avage; violently active in the field, &s;u|pinely
indolent at home. His train of ideas was
confined to dogs, hor&s;es, hares, foxes: not a ra|tional
idea entered the train, not a &s;park of pa|trioti&s;m,
nothing done for the public, his depend|ents
en&s;laved and not fed, no hu&s;bandry, no em|belli&s;hment,
loath&s;ome weeds round his dwelling,
di&s;order and dirt within. Con&s;ider the pre&s;ent
mode of living. How delightful the change,
from the hunter to the farmer, from the de&s;troyer
of animals to the feeder of men! Our gentle|men
who live in the country, have become active
and indu&s;trious farmers. They embelli&s;h their
fields, improve their lands, and give bread to
thou&s;ands. Every new day promotes health and
&s;pirits; and every new day brings variety of en|joyment.
They are happy at home; and they
wi&s;h happine&s;s to all.</P>
<P>As the &s;cene of the author's experience has
all along been in Scotland, his native coun|try,
<PB N="xix" REF="18">
he is &s;hy to recommend his plan of hu&s;|bandry
to any but to his countrymen. He
has, however, a thorough conviction, that giving
allowance for &s;light variations of climate, his
plan will &s;uit England, France, Italy, and every
other country &s;ituated within either of the tempe|rate
zones.</P>
<P>IN arts and &s;ciences, a plentiful &s;ource of ob|&s;curity
and indi&s;tinctne&s;s, is the u&s;ing a word in
different &s;en&s;es, without warning the reader of it.
Con&s;idering what volumes have been compo&s;ed on
agriculture, it is amazing, how little preci&s;ion is
in the terms of art. Take the following in&s;tance.
The word <HI>furrow</HI> is employed to &s;ignify not only
the hollow made by the plough, but the earth
taken out of that hollow, and al&s;o the hollow be|tween
ridges. Better coin words than write in|di&s;tinctly.
Let <HI>furrow</HI> be appropriated to the
&s;pace in which the plough moves, and al&s;o to the
hollow between ridges; which will not occa&s;ion
any confu&s;ion. But I venture to di&s;tingui&s;h the
earth moved by the plough, by the name of the
<HI>furrow-&s;lice.</HI> The &s;mall hollows that appear be|tween
<PB N="xx" REF="19">
the &s;lices when a ridge is ploughed, may
be termed <HI>&s;eams.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nota bene,</HI> The Engli&s;h acre, the Linlith|gow
mea&s;ure, the Dutch weight, are to be un|der&s;tood,
where the contrary is not &s;pecified.</P>

<HEAD>THE

<P>NAtural Hi&s;tory is confined to effects,
leaving cau&s;es to Natural Philo&s;ophy.
From a number of effects, Natural
Philo&s;ophy a&s;cends by induction to the
immediate cau&s;e; and from &s;uch cau&s;es to what
are more comprehen&s;ive. Mo&s;t writers on hu&s;|bandry
handle it as a branch of Natural Hi&s;tory.
Some, more bold, con&s;ider it as al&s;o a branch of
Natural Philo&s;ophy: they begin with effects, and
endeavour to unfold the cau&s;es or principles. In
addre&s;&s;ing this treati&s;e to Gentlemen, I attempt
both. This &s;ugge&s;ts a divi&s;ion into two parts. In
the fir&s;t part, which indeed is the mo&s;t u&s;eful, the
be&s;t practice in every branch of hu&s;bandry is care|fully
explained. In the &s;econd, with timid &s;teps
and &s;low, I endeavour to trace out a few cau&s;es or
principles that have an immediate influence upon
practice.</P>

<P>IN the natural cour&s;e of ideas, the hand goes
before the in&s;trument, and the in&s;trument be|fore
the operation. But as the nature of man is
a &s;ubject too important and too exten&s;ive to be
ranged under any other head, I begin this trea|ti&s;e
of agriculture with the in&s;truments it employs.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>1. The PLOUGH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is the mo&s;t u&s;eful in&s;trument that ever was
invented. It is of more u&s;e than even the &s;pin|ning-wheel:
for men may make a &s;hift for cloath|ing
without that in&s;trument, but a country cannot
be populous without the plough.</P>
<P>The only plough u&s;ed in Scotland, till of late, is
a &s;trong heavy in&s;trument, about thirteen feet
<PB REF="26">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="3" REF="27">
from the handles to the extremity of the beam,
and commonly above four feet from the back end
of the head to the point of the &s;ock. It is termed
the <HI>Scotch plough,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from other
forms; and it needs no particular de&s;cription, as
it may be &s;een in every field. It may well be
termed the <HI>Scotch plough;</HI> for of all forms it is
the fitte&s;t for breaking up &s;tiff and rough land, e|&s;pecially
where &s;tones abound; and no le&s;s fit for
&s;trong clays hardened by drought. The length
of its head gives it a firm hold of the ground: its
weight prevents it from being thrown out by
&s;tones: the length of the handles gives the plough|man
great command to direct its motion: and
by the length of its head, and of its mould|board,
it lays the furrow-&s;lice cleverly over. The
Scotch plough was contrived during the infancy of
agriculture, and was well contrived: in the &s;oils
above de&s;cribed, it has not an equal.</P>
<P>But in tender &s;oil it is improper, becau&s;e it adds
greatly to the expence of ploughing, without any
counterbalancing benefit. The length of the head
and mouldboard encrea&s;e the friction, and con|&s;equently
it requires a greater number of oxen or
hor&s;es than are nece&s;&s;ary in a &s;horter plough. There
is another particular in its form, that re&s;i&s;ts the
draught: the mouldboard makes an angle with
the &s;ock, in&s;tead of making a line with it gently
curving backward. There is an objection again&s;t
it no le&s;s &s;olid, that it does not &s;tir the ground
<PB N="4" REF="28">
perfectly: the hinder part of the wri&s;t ri&s;es a foot
above the &s;ole of the head: and the earth that lies
immediately below that hinder part, is left un&s;tir|red.
This is ribbing land below the &s;urface, &s;i|milar
to what is done by ignorant farmers on the
&s;urface.</P>
<P>The&s;e defects mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to in a &s;oil that
requires a &s;trong heavy plough; but may be a|voided
in a cultivated &s;oil by a plough differently
con&s;tructed. Of all the ploughs fitted for a culti|vated
&s;oil free of &s;tones, I boldly recommend a
plough introduced into Scotland about twelve years
ago, by James Small in Blackadder Mount, Ber|wick&s;hire;
which is now in great reque&s;t; and
with great rea&s;on, as it avoids all the defects of
the Scotch plough. The &s;hortne&s;s of its head and
of its mouldboard le&s;&s;en the friction greatly: from
the point of the &s;ock to the back part of the
head it is only thirty inches; and the whole
length, from the point of the beam to the end of
the handles, between eight and nine feet. The
&s;ock and mouldboard make one line gently cur|ving;
and con&s;equently gather no earth. In|&s;tead
of a wri&s;t, the under edge of the mould|board
is in one plain with the &s;ole of the head;
which makes a wide furrow, without leaving any
part un&s;tirred. It is termed the <HI>chain-plough,</HI> be|cau&s;e
it is drawn by an iron chain fixed to the back
part of the beam immediately before the coulter.
This has two advantages: fir&s;t, by means of a
<PB N="5" REF="29">
muzzle it makes the plough go deep, or &s;hallow;
and, next, it &s;tre&s;&s;es the beam le&s;s than if fixed
to the point, and therefore a &s;lenderer beam is
&s;ufficient. The&s;e particulars will be better under|&s;tood
from in&s;pecting the annexed figure.</P>
<P>This plough may well be con&s;idered as a capital
improvement; not only by &s;aving expence, but
by making better work. It is proper for loams,
for car&s;e clays, and, in general, for every &s;ort of
tender &s;oil free of &s;tones. It is even proper for
opening up pa&s;ture-ground, where the &s;oil has
been formerly well cultivated.</P>
<P>To fini&s;h an account of the plough, I mu&s;t add
a word about the &s;ock. A &s;piked &s;ock is u&s;ed in
the Scotch plough, and is e&s;&s;ential in &s;tony land.
But a feathered &s;ock ought always to be u&s;ed in
tender &s;oil, free of &s;tones: it cuts the earth in the
furrow, and makes neat work. It is indi&s;pen|&s;able
in ground where roots abound, as it cuts
them below the &s;urface, and prevents their grow|ing.
I e&s;teem the feathered &s;ock to be a valuable
improvement. The indu&s;trious farmer would even
borrow money to clear his ground of &s;tones, in
order to introduce it: in a twenty-years lea&s;e, the
profit of it would repay the expence tenfold.</P>
<P>Some ploughs are made with two &s;mall wheels
running in the furrow, in order to take off the
friction of the head; and this plough is recom|mended
in a book, intitled, <HI>The complete farmer.</HI>
But all complicated ploughs are baubles; and this
<PB N="6" REF="30">
as much as any. The pivots of &s;uch wheels are
always going wrong; and be&s;ide, they are choked
&s;o with earth, as to increa&s;e the friction in&s;tead of
dimini&s;hing it.</P>
<P>If we look back thirty years, ploughs of differ|ent
con&s;tructions did not enter even into a dream.
The Scotch plough was univer&s;ally u&s;ed; and no
other was known. There was no le&s;s ignorance as
to the number of cattle nece&s;&s;ary for this plough.
In the &s;outh of Scotland, &s;ix oxen and two hor&s;es
were univer&s;al; and in the north, ten oxen, &s;ome|times
twelve. The fir&s;t attempt to le&s;&s;en the num|ber
of oxen, was in Berwick&s;hire. The low part
of that county abounds with &s;tone, clay, and marl,
the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial of all manures, which had
been long u&s;ed by one or two gentlemen. About
twenty-five years ago it acquired reputation, and
&s;pread rapidly. As two hor&s;es and two oxen were
employed in every marl-cart; the farmer, in &s;um|mer-fallowing
and in preparing land for marl,
was confined to four oxen and two hor&s;es. And
as that manure afforded plenty of &s;ucculent &s;traw
for oxen, the farmer was &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that
four oxen did better now than &s;ix formerly.
Marling, however, a laborious work, proceeded
&s;lowly, till people were taught by a noted farmer
in that country, what indu&s;try can perform by
means of power properly applied. It was recknon|ed
a mighty ta&s;k to marl five or &s;ix acres in a
year. That gentleman, by plenty of red clover
<PB N="7" REF="31">
for his working-cattle, accompli&s;hed the marling
fifty acres in a &s;ummer, once fifty-four. Having
&s;o much occa&s;ion for oxen, he tried with &s;ucce&s;s
two oxen and two hor&s;es in a plough; and that
practice became general in Berwick&s;hire.</P>
<P>Now here appears with lu&s;tre the advantage of
the chain-plough. The great friction occa&s;ioned
in the Scotch plough by a long head, and by the
angle it makes with the mould-board, nece&s;&s;arily
requires two oxen and two hor&s;es, whatever the
&s;oil be. The friction is &s;o much le&s;s in the chain-plough,
that two good hor&s;es are found &s;ufficient
in every &s;oil that is proper for it. And as good
luck &s;eldom comes alone more than bad, the re|ducing
the draught to a couple of hor&s;es has an|other
advantage, that of rendering a driver unne|ce&s;&s;ary;
no &s;light &s;aving at pre&s;ent, where a &s;er|vant's
wages and maintenance are very &s;mart ar|ticles.
This &s;aving on every plough, where two
hor&s;es and two oxen were formerly u&s;ed, will by
the &s;tricte&s;t computation be fifteen pounds Ster|ling
yearly; and where four hor&s;es were u&s;ed, no
le&s;s than twenty pounds Sterling. There is now
&s;carce to be &s;een in the low country of Berwick|&s;hire
a plough with more than two hor&s;es; which
undoubtedly in time will become general. I
know but of one further improvement, that of
u&s;ing two oxen in&s;tead of two hor&s;es. That
draught has been employed with &s;ucce&s;s in &s;everal
places; and the &s;aving is &s;o great, that it mu&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="32">
force its way every where. I boldly affirm, that
no &s;oil &s;tirred in a proper &s;ea&s;on, can ever require
more than two hor&s;es and two oxen, in a plough,
even &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;tiffe&s;t clay. In all other &s;oils,
two good hor&s;es, or two good oxen abrea&s;t, may
be relied on for every operation of the chain-plough.</P>
<P>A chain-plough of a &s;maller &s;ize than ordinary,
drawn by a &s;ingle hor&s;e, is of all the mo&s;t proper
for hor&s;e-hoeing, &s;uppo&s;ing the land to be mellow,
which it ought to be for that operation. It is &s;uf|ficient
for making furrows to receive the dung,
for ploughing the drills after dunging, and for hoe|ing
the crop.</P>
<P>A &s;till &s;maller plough of the &s;ame kind, I warm|ly
recommend for a kitchen-garden. It can be
reduced to the &s;malle&s;t &s;ize, by being made of
iron; and where the land is properly dre&s;&s;ed for a
kitchen-garden, an iron plough drawn by a hor&s;e
of the &s;malle&s;t &s;ize will &s;ave much &s;pade-work.
Strange is the effect of cu&s;tom without thought!
Thirty years ago, a kitchen-garden was an article
of luxury merely, becau&s;e at that time there could
be no cheaper food than oat-meal. At pre&s;ent,
the farmer maintains his &s;ervants at double expence,
as the price of oat-meal is doubled; and yet he
has no notion of a kitchen-garden, more than he
had thirty years ago. He never thinks, that li|ving
partly on cabbage, kail, turnip, carrot,
would &s;ave much oat-meal: nor does he ever
<PB N="9" REF="33">
think, that change of food is more whole&s;ome,
than vegetables alone, or oat-meal alone. I need
not recommend potatoes, which in our late &s;canty
crops of corn have proved a great ble&s;&s;ing: with|out
them the labouring poor would frequently
have been reduced to a &s;tarving condition.
Would the farmer but cultivate his kitchen-garden
with as much indu&s;try as he be&s;tows on
his potato-crop, he needed never fear want;
and he can cultivate it with the iron plough at a
very &s;mall expence. It may be held by a boy of
twelve or thirteen; and would be a proper educa|tion
for a ploughman. But it is the landlord who
ought to give a beginning to the improvement.
A very &s;mall expence would enclo&s;e an acre for a
kitcken-garden to each of his tenants; and it
would excite their indu&s;try, to be&s;tow an iron
plough on tho&s;e who do be&s;t.</P>
<P>Nor is this the only ca&s;e where a &s;ingle-hor&s;e
plough may be profitably employ'd. It is &s;uffi|cient
for &s;eed-furrowing barley, where the land
is light and well dre&s;&s;ed. It may be u&s;ed in the
&s;econd or third ploughing of fallow, to encourage
annual weeds, which are de&s;troy'd in &s;ub&s;equent
ploughings.</P>
<P>To procure food is indeed the chief object of
the plough, but not its only object. Good roads
are e&s;&s;ential to internal commerce; and the ex|pence
of making them may be con&s;iderably le&s;&s;en|ed
by the plough. As this hitherto has been
<PB N="10" REF="34">
little thought of, an explanation is nece&s;&s;ary. The
method in u&s;e is, to form a road with the pick,
the &s;pade, and the wheelbarrow. Even where
the pick is not nece&s;&s;ary, you &s;ee ten or twelve
men pre&s;&s;ing down the &s;pade with the foot oftener
than once before a &s;ufficient load of earth can be
rai&s;ed;&mdash;dearly bought by the workmen, and
&s;till more dearly by the employer. Where a pick
is nece&s;&s;ary, there mu&s;t be a great addition of
hands; for ten pickmen are no more than &s;uffi|cient
to loo&s;en what can be thrown up with four
or five &s;pades. Now a great part of this labour
may be &s;aved by a plough. The Scotch plough,
fortified with iron plates, and the head connected
with the beam by a bar of iron, is an excellent
in&s;trument for making roads. Suppo&s;e a new
road is purpo&s;ed thirty feet wide, plough it up
into a ridge, beginning in the middle; and plough
it a &s;econd time in the &s;ame manner. Where the
ground is &s;oft, and requires to be rai&s;ed high, a
very deep furrow is nece&s;&s;ary. Where the ground
is firm, a &s;hallow furrow is &s;ufficient. After the&s;e
two ploughings are fini&s;hed, if the &s;ides of the
road be too &s;teep, leave &s;ix feet in the middle,
and go round the remainder in a third ploughing,
gathering it toward the top. If the &s;ides be &s;till
too &s;teep, leave twelve feet in the middle, and
gather up the remainder as in the former plough|ing.
If the&s;e operations be well conducted, the
water-channels on each &s;ide of the road will be
<PB N="11" REF="35">
two feet lower than the &s;urface of the adjacent
ground. Smooth the road with a brake; and
correct with a &s;pade any remaining defects or in|equalities,
which is a very ea&s;y work. Thus the
road is completely formed for a covering of gravel,
or of &s;tones beat &s;mall.</P>
<P>A plough may al&s;o be u&s;ed advantageou&s;ly in
making ditches for enclo&s;ing. In hard or gra|velly
&s;oil, the immen&s;e co&s;t of picking and &s;pading
may be totally &s;aved by the plough. The &s;ur|face-earth
is commonly &s;oft: after it is removed
with the &s;pade, let a plough, drawn by three hor|&s;es
in a line, go round and round the &s;pace in|tended
for the ditch, cleaving it as if it were a
ridge. After the earth thus loo&s;ened is thrown up
with the &s;hovel, renew the ploughing and &s;hovel|ling
till you come within eight inches of the bot|tom;
and to the&s;e eight inches apply the pick and
&s;pade. One precaution is nece&s;&s;ary, that no more
be ploughed at a time than can be thrown up
the &s;ame day. If rain fall in any quantity, the
ground tilled will become mud, very improper to
be laid upon thorns. In this operation there is
no occa&s;ion for the coulter: it is rather an impedi|ment.
I e&s;teem this a valuable di&s;covery for Scot|land;
which being more pe&s;tered with high winds
than England, requires more to be enclo&s;ed. The
expence of inclo&s;ing with hedge and ditch the or|dinary
way, is great; and the ditch is the mo&s;t
expen&s;ive part. Two thirds of the expence may
<PB N="12" REF="36">
be &s;aved by the plough, in ground that requires
picking.</P>
<P>In every ca&s;e where earth is to be removed,
the plough is u&s;eful; as for example in a gravel-pit
opened for high-roads. The gravel may be &s;o
loo&s;ened by the plough as to require a &s;hovel only
for filling it into the carts.</P>
<P>Has any one &s;tumbled on the thought of u&s;ing
the plough in planting young trees? The method
I have practi&s;ed, is to mark out lines due north
and &s;outh, at intervals of ten or twelve feet. Let
three furrows be made with the plough at the &s;ide
of each line. Lay the &s;od of the ea&s;tmo&s;t furrow
upon the other two, which will rai&s;e a wall above
two feet high. Plant along the furrow from
whence the &s;od was removed, and the wall behind
will make good &s;helter. This method is chiefly
intended for firs in a bare moor. Before the firs
ri&s;e much above the &s;helter, the roots will have
taken &s;uch hold of the ground as to re&s;i&s;t even
we&s;terly winds: &s;carce a plant will fail, if they be
whol&s;ome. Three thou&s;and firs planted in this
manner may be &s;ufficient for an acre, equal to five
or &s;ix thou&s;and in the ordinary way.</P>
<P>A fir makes a choice nur&s;e for other trees. Af|ter
three years, even in the poore&s;t &s;oil, the firs
begin to grow with vigour; and then is the time
for planting oaks, elms, or other trees among
them; cutting down the firs from time to time to
make room for the other trees. Thus, the me|thod
<PB N="13" REF="37">
here pointed out for planting firs, is the be&s;t
preparation for rai&s;ing all other barren trees.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>2. The BRAKE.</HEAD>
<P>THE brake is a large and weighty harrow, the
purpo&s;e of which is to reduce a &s;tubborn &s;oil,
where an ordinary harrow makes little impre&s;&s;ion.
It con&s;i&s;ts of four &s;quare bulls, each &s;ide five
inches, and &s;ix feet and a half in length. The
teeth are &s;eventeen inches long, bending forward
like a coulter. Four of them are in&s;erted into
each bull, fixed above with a &s;crew-nut, having
twelve inches free below, with a heel clo&s;e to the
under part of the bull, to prevent it from being
pu&s;hed back by &s;tones. The nut above makes it
ea&s;y to be taken out for &s;harping. This brake
requires four hor&s;es or four oxen. One of a le&s;&s;er
&s;ize will not fully an&s;wer the purpo&s;e: one of a
larger &s;ize will require &s;ix oxen; in which ca&s;e
the work may be performed at le&s;s expence with
the plough. See the figure annexed.</P>
<P>This in&s;trument may be applied to great advan|tage
in the following circum&s;tances. In the fal|lowing
&s;trong clay that requires frequent plough|ings,
a brakeing between every ploughing, will
pulverize the &s;oil, and render the &s;ub&s;equent
ploughings more ea&s;y. In the month of March
or April, when &s;trong ground is ploughed for
barley, e&s;pecially if bound with couch-gra&s;s, a
<PB N="14" REF="38">
cro&s;s brakeing is preferable to a cro&s;s-ploughing,
and is done at half the expence. When ground
is ploughed from the &s;tate of nature, and after a
competent time is cro&s;s-ploughed, the brake is ap|plied
with great &s;ucce&s;s, immediately after the cro&s;s-ploughing,
to reduce the whole to proper tilth.</P>
<P>Let it be ob&s;erved, that a brake with a greater
number of teeth than above mentioned, is im|proper
for ground that is bound together by the
roots of plants, which is always the ca&s;e of ground
new broken up from its natural &s;tate. The brake
is &s;oon choked, and can do no execution till freed
from the earth it holds. A le&s;s number of teeth
would be deficient in pulverizing the &s;oil.</P>
<P>To &s;et in a clear light the advantages of this
in&s;trument, we will &s;top a little to ob&s;erve how
in&s;ufficient the common harrow is for any of the
operations mentioned. It may an&s;wer for cover|ing
the feed, and may do tolerably well in light
and free &s;oil; but is altogether in&s;ufficient for re|ducing
&s;tiff &s;oil. The harrow with wooden teeth
is a ridiculous in&s;trument, fit to rai&s;e laughter in|&s;tead
of rai&s;ing mould. The poor farmer labours
with it, thinks he is doing an u&s;eful work, when
all the time he is doing nothing. It ought to be
prohibited by the landlord; for a tenant with
&s;uch an in&s;trument cannot pay a rent that the
farm properly cultivated will ea&s;ily bear. Tho'
the brake has been known above twenty years,
yet none but gentlemen, and a few &s;elect tenants,
<PB REF="39">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="15" REF="40">
have ever thought of it: in &s;ome counties even
the name remains unknown. It belongs to gen|tlemen
of fortune, for their own intere&s;t, to make
it more general. The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome in&s;tru|ment,
more effectual than the common harrow,
for reducing a &s;tubborn &s;oil, has led farmers to
put three or four harrows, one above another, in
order to pre&s;s the undermo&s;t into the ground.
This &s;ub&s;titute to the brake is far inferior in its
effect; be&s;ide, that the undermo&s;t harrow is torn
to pieces in an in&s;tant. To conclude this article,
a farmer who has no brake, wants a capital in|&s;trument
of hu&s;bandry. Its price above that of
common harrows, bears no proportion to the
profit.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>3. The HARROW.</HEAD>
<P>HARROWS are commonly con&s;idered as of no
u&s;e but to cover the &s;eed. They have another
u&s;e &s;carce le&s;s e&s;&s;ential, which is to prepare land
for the &s;eed. This is an article of importance
for producing a good crop. And to &s;hew how
imperfectly either of the&s;e purpo&s;es is performed
by the common harrow, take the following ac|count
of it.</P>
<P>The harrow commonly u&s;ed is of different
forms. The fir&s;t I &s;hall mention has two bulls,
four feet long and eighteen inches a&s;under, with
four wooden teeth in each. A &s;econd has three
<PB REF="41">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="16" REF="42">
bulls and twelve wooden teeth. A third has four
bulls, and twenty teeth, of wood or iron, ten, e|leven,
or twelve inches a&s;under. Now, in fine
mould the la&s;t may be &s;ufficient for covering the
&s;eed; but none of them are &s;ufficient to prepare
for the &s;eed any ground that requires &s;ubduing.
The only tolerable form is that with iron teeth;
and the bare de&s;cription of its imperfections, will
&s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of a more perfect form. In
the fir&s;t place, this harrow is by far too light for
ground new taken up from the &s;tate of nature,
for clays hardened with &s;pring-drought, or for o|ther
&s;tubborn &s;oils: it floats on the &s;urface, and
after frequent returns in the &s;ame track, nothing
is done effectually. In the next place, the teeth
are too thick &s;et, by which the harrow is apt to
be choked, e&s;pecially where the earth is bound
with roots, which is commonly the ca&s;e. At the
&s;ame time, the lightne&s;s and number of teeth keep
the harrow upon the &s;urface, and prevent one of
its capital purpo&s;es, that of dividing the &s;oil. Nor
will fewer teeth an&s;wer for covering the &s;eed pro|perly.
In the third place, the teeth are too &s;hort
for reducing a coar&s;e &s;oil to proper tilth; and yet
it would be in vain to make them longer, becau&s;e
the harrow is too light for going deep into the
ground. Further, the common harrows are &s;o
ill con&s;tructed, as to ride at every turn one upon
another. Much time is lo&s;t in di&s;engaging them.
What pity is it, that an indu&s;trious farmer &s;hould
<PB N="17" REF="43">
be reduced to &s;uch an imperfect in&s;trument, which
is neither fit to prepare the ground for &s;eed, nor
to cover it properly. And I now add, that it is
equally unfit for extirpating weeds. The ground
is frequently &s;o bound with couch-gra&s;s, as to
make the furrow-&s;lice &s;tand upright, as when old
lea is ploughed: notwith&s;tanding much labour,
the gra&s;s-roots keep the field, and gain the victory.
What follows? The farmer at la&s;t is reduced to
the nece&s;&s;ity of leaving the weeds in peaceable
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e his field will no longer bear
corn.</P>
<P>A little reflection, even without experience,
will make it evident, that the &s;ame harrows, what|ever
be the form, can never an&s;wer all the differ|ent
purpo&s;es of harrowing, nor can operate equal|ly
in all different &s;oils, rough or &s;mooth, firm or
loo&s;e. Looking back not many years above thir|ty,
no farmer in Scotland had the &s;lighte&s;t notion
of different ploughs for different purpo&s;es. The
Scotch plough was the only one known. Differ|ent
ploughs are now introduced; and it is full
time to think of different harrows. Rejecting the
common harrows, as in every re&s;pect badly con|&s;tructed,
I boldly recommend the following. I u&s;e
three of them of different forms, for different pur|po&s;es.
They are all of the &s;ame weight, drawn
each by two hor&s;es. Birch is the be&s;t wood for
them, becau&s;e it is cheap, and not apt to &s;plit.
The fir&s;t is compo&s;ed of four bulls, each four
<PB N="18" REF="44">
feet ten inches long, three and a quarter inches
broad, and three and a half deep; the interval
between the bulls eleven and three fourths inches;
&s;o that the breadth of the whole harrow is four
feet. The bulls are connected by four &s;heths,
which go through each bull, and are fixed by tim|ber
nails driven through both. In each bull five
teeth are in&s;erted, ten inches free under the bull,
and ten inches a&s;under. They are of the &s;ame
form with tho&s;e of the brake, and in&s;erted into
the wood in the &s;ame manner. Each of the&s;e
teeth is three pounds weight: and where the har|row
is made of birch, the weight of the whole is
&s;ix &s;tone fourteen pounds Dutch. An erect bridle
is fixed at a corner of the harrow, three inches
high, with four notches for drawing higher or
lower. To this bridle a double tree is fixed for
two hor&s;es drawing abrea&s;t, as in a plough. And
to &s;trengthen the harrow, a flat rod of iron is
nailed upon the harrow from corner to corner in
the line of the draught.</P>
<P>The &s;econd harrow con&s;i&s;ts of two parts, con|nected
together by a crank or hinge in the mid|dle,
and two chains of equal length, one at each
end, which keep the two parts always parallel,
and at the &s;ame di&s;tance from each other. The
crank is &s;o contrived, as to allow the two parts to
ply to the ground like two unconnected harrows;
but neither of them to ri&s;e above the other, more
than if they were a &s;ingle harrow without a joint.
<PB N="19" REF="45">
In a word, they may form an angle downward.
but not upward. Thus they have the effect of
two harrows in curved ground, and of one
weighty harrow in a plain. This harrow is com|po&s;ed
of &s;ix bulls, each four feet long, three
inches broad, and three and a half deep. The
interval between the bulls nine and a half inches;
which makes the breadth of the whole harrow,
including the length of the crank, to be five feet
five inches. Each bull has five teeth, nine inches
free under the wood, and ten inches a&s;under.
The weight of each tooth is two pounds; the re&s;t
as in the former.</P>
<P>The third con&s;i&s;ts al&s;o of two parts, connected
together like that la&s;t mentioned. It has eight
bulls, each four feet long, two and a half inches
broad, and three deep. The interval between the
bulls is eight inches: and the breadth of the whole
harrow, including the length of the crank, is &s;ix
feet four inches. In each bull are in&s;erted five
teeth, &s;even inches free under the wood, and ten
and a half inches a&s;under, each tooth weighing
one pound. The re&s;t as in the two former har|rows.
The figure of each is annexed.</P>
<P>The&s;e harrows I hold to be a con&s;iderable im|provement.
They ply to curved ground like two
unconnected harrows, and when drawn in one
plain, they are in effect one harrow of double
weight, which makes the teeth pierce deep into
the ground. The imperfection of common har|rows,
<PB N="20" REF="46">
mentioned above, will &s;ugge&s;t the advanta|ges
of the &s;et of harrows here recommended.
The fir&s;t is proper for harrowing land that has lain
long after ploughing, as where oats are &s;own on
a winter-furrow, and in general for harrowing
&s;tiff land: it pierces deep into the &s;oil by its long
teeth, and divides it minutely. The &s;econd is in|tended
for covering the &s;eed: its long teeth lays
the &s;eed deeper than the common harrow can do;
which is no &s;light advantage By placing the &s;eed
con&s;iderably under the &s;urface, the young plants
are, on the one hand, protected from too much
heat, and, on the other, have &s;ufficiency of moi|&s;ture.
At the &s;ame time, the &s;eed is &s;o well co|vered
that none of it is lo&s;t. Seed &s;lightly cover|ed
by the common harrows, wants moi&s;ture, and
is burnt up by the &s;un; be&s;ide, that a proportion
of it is left upon the &s;urface uncovered. The
third harrow &s;upplies what may be deficient in the
&s;econd, by &s;moothing the &s;urface, and covering
the &s;eed more accurately. The three harrows
make the ground finer and finer, as heckles do
lint; or, to u&s;e a different compari&s;on, the fir&s;t
harrow makes the bed, the &s;econd lays the &s;eed
in it, the third &s;mooths the cloaths. The&s;e ad|vantages
are certain. If any man doubt, let him
try the experiment, and he will find the effect of
them in his crops. I can &s;ay &s;o with a&s;&s;urance
from the experience of many years. They have
another advantage not inferior to any mentioned;
<PB N="21" REF="47">
they mix manure with the &s;oil more intimately
than can be done by common harrows; and up|on
&s;uch intimate mixture depends greatly the ef|fect
of manure, as &s;hall be explained afterward.
To conclude, the&s;e harrows are contrived to an|&s;wer
an e&s;tabli&s;hed principle in agriculture, That
fertility depends greatly on pulverizing the &s;oil,
and on an intimate mixture of manure with it,
whether dung, lime, marl, or any other.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>4. The ROLLER.</HEAD>
<P>THE roller is an in&s;trument of capital u&s;e in
hu&s;bandry, though &s;carcely known in ordinary
practice; and, where introduced, it is commonly
&s;o &s;light as to have very little effect.</P>
<P>Rollers are of different kinds, &s;tone, yetling,
wood. Each of the&s;e has its advantages. I re|commend
the la&s;t, con&s;tructed in the following
manner. Take the body of a tree, &s;ix feet ten
inches long, the larger the better, made as near
a perfect cylinder as po&s;&s;ible. Surround this cy|linder
with three rows of fillies, one row in the
middle, and one at each end. Line the&s;e fillies
with planks of wood equally long with the roller,
and &s;o narrow as to ply into a circle. Bind them
fa&s;t together with iron rings. Beech wood is the
be&s;t, being hard and tough. The roller thus
mounted, ought to have a diameter of three feet
ten inches. It has a double pair of &s;hafts for two
<PB N="22" REF="48">
hor&s;es abrea&s;t. The&s;e are &s;ufficient in level
ground: in ground not level, four hor&s;es may be
nece&s;&s;ary. The roller without the &s;hafts ought to
weigh two hundred &s;tone Dutch; and the large
diameter makes this great weight ea&s;y to be
drawn.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;ea&s;on for rolling. Rolling
wheat in the month of April, is an important ar|ticle
in loo&s;e &s;oil; as the winter-rains pre&s;&s;ing
down the &s;oil leave many roots in the air. Bar|ley
ought to be rolled immediately after the &s;eed
is &s;own; e&s;pecially where gra&s;s-&s;eeds are &s;own
with it. The be&s;t time for rolling a gravelly &s;oil,
is as &s;oon as the mould is &s;o dry as to bear the
roller without clinging to it. A clay &s;oil ought
neither to be tilled, harrowed, nor rolled, till the
field be perfectly dry. And as rolling a clay &s;oil
is chiefly intended for &s;moothing the &s;urface, a
dry &s;ea&s;on may be patiently waited for, even till
the crop be three inches high. There is the
greater rea&s;on for this precaution, becau&s;e much
rain immediately after rolling is apt to cake the
&s;urface when drought follows. Oats in a light
&s;oil may be rolled immediately after the &s;eed is
&s;own, unle&s;s the ground be &s;o wet as to cling to
the roller. In a clay &s;oil, delay rolling till the
grain be above ground. The proper time for
&s;owing gra&s;s-&s;eeds in an oat-field, is when the
grain is three inches high; and rolling &s;hould im|mediately
&s;ucceed whatever the &s;oil be. Flax
<PB N="23" REF="49">
ought to be rolled immediately after &s;owing.
This &s;hould never be neglected; for it makes the
&s;eed pu&s;h equally, and prevents after growth, the
bad effect of which is vi&s;ible in every &s;tep of the
proce&s;s for dre&s;&s;ing flax. The fir&s;t year's crop of
&s;own gra&s;&s;es ought to be rolled as early the next
&s;pring as the ground will bear the hor&s;es. It fixes
all the roots preci&s;ely as in the ca&s;e of wheat.
Rolling the &s;econd and third crops in loo&s;e &s;oil, is
an u&s;eful work; though not &s;o e&s;&s;ential as rolling
the fir&s;t crop.</P>
<P>The effects of rolling properly u&s;ed, are &s;ub|&s;tantial.
In the fir&s;t place, it renders a loo&s;e &s;oil
more compact and &s;olid; which encourages the
growth of plants, by making the earth clap clo&s;e
to every part of every root. Nor need we be a|fraid
of rendering the &s;oil too compact; for no
roller that can be drawn by two or four hor&s;es
will have that effect. In the next place, rolling
keeps in the moi&s;ture, and hinders drought to
penetrate. This effect is of great moment. In a
dry &s;ea&s;on, it may make the difference of a good
crop, or no crop, e&s;pecially where the &s;oil is light.
In the third place, the rolling gra&s;s-&s;eeds, be&s;ide
the foregoing advantages, facilitates the mowing
for hay. And it is to be hoped, that the advan|tage
of this practice will lead farmers to mow
their corn al&s;o, which will encrea&s;e the quantity
of &s;traw, both for food and for the dunghill.</P>
<P>There is a &s;mall roller for breaking clods in
<PB N="24" REF="50">
land intended for barley. The common way is,
to break clods with a mell, which requires many
hands, and is a laborious work. This roller per|forms
the work more effectually, and at much
le&s;s expence: let a harrowing precede, which
will break the clods a little; and after lying a
day or a day and half to dry, this roller will
di&s;&s;olve them into powder. This however does
not &s;uper&s;ede the u&s;e of the great roller after all
the other articles are fini&s;hed, in order to make
the &s;oil compact, and to keep out the &s;ummer|drought.
A &s;tone roller four feet long, and fif|teen
inches diameter, drawn by one hor&s;e, is &s;uf|ficient
to break clods that are ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olved by
pre&s;&s;ure. The u&s;e of this roller in preparing
ground for barley is gaining ground daily, even
among ordinary tenants, who have become &s;en|&s;ible
both of the expence and toil of u&s;ing wooden
mells. But in a clay &s;oil, the clods are &s;ome|times
too firm, or too tough, to be &s;ubdued by &s;o
light a machine. In that ca&s;e, a roller of the &s;ame
&s;ize, but of a different con&s;truction, is nece&s;&s;ary.
It ought to be &s;urrounded with circles of iron, &s;ix
inches a&s;under, and &s;even inches deep; which
will cut even the mo&s;t &s;tubborn clods, and reduce
them to powder. Let not this in&s;trument be con|&s;idered
as a finical refinement. In a &s;tiff clay, it
may make the difference of a plentiful or &s;canty
crop.</P>

<HEAD>5. The FANNER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS in&s;trument for winnowing corn was in|troduced
into Scotland not many years ago. For|merly
wind being our only re&s;ource, the winnow|ing
of corn was no le&s;s precarious than the grind|ing
it at a windmill: people often were redu|ced
to famine in the mid&s;t of plenty. There was
another bad effect: it was nece&s;&s;ary to place a
barn open to the we&s;t wind, however irregular or
inconvenient the &s;ituation might be with regard to
the other buildings. But it is needle&s;s to be par|ticular
upon that u&s;eful in&s;trument; becau&s;e every
farmer con&s;iders it now as no le&s;s e&s;&s;ential than a

<DIV4>
<HEAD>1. FARM-HORSES.</HEAD>
<P>A HORSE fit for a waggon, cart, or plough,
ought to be &s;trong, compact, and about
fifteen hands high. A carter or a ploughman
cannot perform the &s;ame work with hor&s;es of le&s;s
&s;ize; by which there is a con&s;iderable lo&s;s, as
he is paid by the year, not by the quantity of
<PB N="26" REF="52">
work he performs. Great attention ought to be
given to the breaking a farm-hor&s;e: good educa|tion
will make him tractable, and obedient to the
voice, without nece&s;&s;ity of applying the whip: the
former makes the whole team move at once; the
latter moves the hor&s;e only that feels it.</P>
<P>We &s;top a little to con&s;ider the di&s;advantage of
&s;mall and ill-fed hor&s;es, common in Scotland. Two
&s;tout hor&s;es in a plough will make as deep a fur|row
as four of what are commonly u&s;ed; and yet
the former are le&s;s expen&s;ive both in price and
maintenance. A gentleman cannot do better for
his own intere&s;t, than to promote a good breed of
farm-hor&s;es: two good hor&s;es will be a &s;aving of
L. 8 Sterling yearly, that is expended by u&s;ing
four weak hor&s;es. I &s;hall mention only the car|riage
of lime. One &s;ervant fills his cart with a
hundred &s;tone, which two good hor&s;es can pull
with ea&s;e. Another lays but the half upon his
cart, becau&s;e his two weak hor&s;es are able for no
more. This is a double lo&s;s to the ma&s;ter: he
gets le&s;s work, not from the hor&s;es only, but al&s;o
from the &s;ervant.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>2. FARM-OXEN.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is not in agriculture any other improve|ment
that equals the u&s;ing oxen in&s;tead of hor&s;es:
they are equally tractable; and they are purcha|&s;ed
and maintained at much le&s;s expence. As
<PB N="27" REF="53">
this improvement is obvious to the meane&s;t capa|city,
one might expect to &s;ee every farmer gree|dily
embracing it, as he would a fea&s;t after being
fami&s;hed. Yet few &s;tir. How is this to be ac|counted
for? Men are led by cu&s;tom in chains;
and in in&s;tances without number are fettered a|gain&s;t
their intere&s;t. &startq;And why &s;hould we pre|tend
to be wi&s;er than our fathers?&endq; they will &s;ay
mode&s;tly, or rather ob&s;tinately.</P>
<P>What warms me upon this &s;ubject, is the great
con&s;umption of oats by work-hor&s;es, which would
be totally &s;aved by u&s;ing oxen only. Did our
own product furni&s;h this con&s;umption, it were le&s;s
to be regretted; but it is grievous to be reduced
to the nece&s;&s;ity of importing annually va&s;t quanti|ties
of oats; all of which would be &s;aved by em|ploying
oxen only in a farm. Nor is this all that
would be &s;aved, as &s;hall be mentioned by and by.</P>
<P>But that I may not be accu&s;ed of declaiming
without foundation, I am willing to enter into a
candid compari&s;on between hor&s;es and oxen as
employ'd in a farm. I begin with affirming, that
an ox is as tractable as a hor&s;e, and as ea&s;ily
trained to a plough or a cart. I have &s;een a
couple of them in a plough going as &s;weetly with|out
a driver as a couple of hor&s;es; directed by
the voice alone without a rein. Oxen be&s;ide are
preferable for a &s;teady draught, as they always
pull to their &s;trength, without ever flinching:
hor&s;es, on the contrary, are apt to &s;top when they
<PB N="28" REF="54">
meet with unexpected re&s;i&s;tance. As oxen have
le&s;s air and &s;pirit in moving than hor&s;es, their mo|tion
is concluded to be &s;lower. They are le&s;s ex|peditious,
it is true, in galloping, or perhaps in
trotting; but as farm-work is performed by &s;tep|ping,
let the &s;tep of a hor&s;e and of an ox be com|pared,
and the latter will be found not inferior,
e&s;pecially where an ox is harne&s;&s;ed like a hor&s;e.
Colonel Pool in Derby&s;hire ploughs as much
ground with three oxen, as the neighbouring
farmers do with four or five hor&s;es. In &s;ummer
they eat nothing but gra&s;s: in winter, they have
hay or turnip when much wrought; &s;traw only
when wrought moderately. About Bawtry, in
York&s;hire, four oxen in a plough do as much
work as the &s;ame number of good hor&s;es. In &s;e|veral
places of Kent, an acre daily is ploughed
with a team of oxen, &s;ometimes a quarter more.
Near Beaconsfield, Mr Burke ploughs an acre in
a day with four oxen; and his neighbours do no
more with four hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Hitherto the compari&s;on holds pretty equal.
In one article oxen are clearly preferable. Their
dung makes excellent manure; and by that means
they always improve the pa&s;ture. Hor&s;e-dung,
on the contrary, burns where it falls, and hurts
the pa&s;ture. Hor&s;e-dung from the &s;table ha$ a
greater tendency to burn than to rot; and to
make it u&s;eful, it requires to be carefully mixed
with cooler materials.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="55">
But the chief advantage of oxen comes under
the article of &s;avings, which branch out into
many particulars. In the fir&s;t place, the price of
a hor&s;e fit for labour doubles that of an ox. An
ox worth &s;even pounds, will perform as much &s;o|lid
work as a hor&s;e worth fourteen. This is an
important article: the labouring cattle are the
mo&s;t expen&s;ive part of a farm-&s;tock; and it is
that expence which keeps back from farming,
many men who&s;e &s;kill and indu&s;try would afford
them a comfortable living. In that view, it is
greatly the intere&s;t of landlords to promote oxen,
as they tend to multiply candidates for a farm;
which not only gives the landlord opportunity for
a proper ch$$$e, but will rai&s;e every farm to its
ju&s;t value.</P>
<P>As an ox is cheaper than a hor&s;e, &s;o he is fed
cheaper in proportion. He requires no corn, and he
works to perfection upon cut gra&s;s in &s;ummer, and
upon hay in winter. He does well even upon oat|&s;traw.
Thus by u&s;ing oxen, a farmer can make mo|ney
of his whole crop of oats, except what is nece&s;|&s;ary
for maintenance of his family. The bulk of
that product, on the contrary, is con&s;umed by
farm-hor&s;es. Even in the car&s;e of Gowry, the
con&s;umption of oats on farm-hor&s;es is &s;o great, that
at Perth and Dundee there are annually imported
between four and five thou&s;and bolls of oat-meal.</P>
<P>A hor&s;e is liable to many di&s;ea&s;es that an ox is
free from. If he happen to turn lame, to which
<PB N="30" REF="56">
he is &s;ubjected from many accidents, he is render|ed
u&s;ele&s;s. An ox can always be turned to ac|count;
for if di&s;abled from work, he can be fat|ted
for the &s;hambles, and can be &s;old for more
than was paid for him.</P>
<P>A hor&s;e commonly turns u&s;ele&s;s for work in ten
years, and the &s;tock of hor&s;es mu&s;t be renewed every
ten years at a medium, which is a deep article of
expence to the farmer. Oxen la&s;t for ever; or,
which comes to the &s;ame, they can be &s;old to the
butcher when pa&s;t the vigour of work, and their
price will be more than &s;ufficient to put young
oxen in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>Hor&s;es require more attendance than oxen:
they mu&s;t be curried, combed, and rubbed down.
Let oxen have their proper quantity of food, and
they require no other care. It is &s;ufficient em|ployment
for a man to manage four or five
hor&s;es: he will manage with equal ea&s;e double
the number of oxen.</P>
<P>The &s;hoeing of hor&s;es is no incon&s;iderable ar|ticle.
The expence of &s;hoeing oxen is a mere
trifle.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;everal articles of &s;aving are &s;ummed up
in a following table, and are very con&s;iderable.
This &s;um ought to go wholly to the landlord as
additional rent. The tenant has no claim for any
&s;hare; becau&s;e after paying that additional rent,
he has as much profit as he had formerly when
he wrought with hor&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="57">
By this mode of hu&s;bandry, the advantage to
the landlord is great; and to the kingdom much
greater, by &s;aving the importation of an immen&s;e
quantity of oats. But the advantage of oxen is
&s;till more exten&s;ive: it reaches every manufactu|rer,
and indeed the whole people. There mu&s;t
be a great increa&s;e of oxen to an&s;wer the pur|po&s;es
of farming: every one of the&s;e, after their
prime is over, goes to the &s;hambles: the markets
are filled with beef, which not only lowers the price
of beef, but of leather and tallow. The &s;avings up|on
the&s;e articles would bring down the wages of
our manufacturers, and con&s;equently the price of
our manufactures in a foreign market; not to
mention that cheap manufactures at home tend
al&s;o to lower wages.</P>
<P>People differ in the manner of yoking oxen.
In &s;ome places they are yoked by the tip of the
horn; in &s;ome by the root. The&s;e modes are
vi&s;ibly inconvenient. When an ox draws by the
&s;houlder like a hor&s;e, his head is free, and his
motion natural. When yoked by the horns, he
lowers his head to the line of the draught: his
po&s;ture is con&s;trained, and his &s;tep &s;hort. His
neck indeed is &s;trong, but his &s;houlder is a better
<HI>fulcrum</HI> for the draught. To yoke an ox by the
&s;houlder, his harne&s;s ought to be the &s;ame with
that of a hor&s;e. The only difference is, that as
his horns hinder the collar from being &s;lipped o|ver
<PB N="32" REF="58">
his head, it mu&s;t be open below, and buckled
after it is on.</P>
<P>When the advantages of oxen for draught
are &s;o great, it cannot but appear &s;trange, that in
Britain oxen have almo&s;t totally been laid a&s;ide.
Among the ancients, we read of no bea&s;ts for
draught but oxen. It was &s;o in Greece, as early
as the days of He&s;iod; and it was &s;o every where.
The Dutch at the Cape of Good Hope plough
with oxen, and exerci&s;e them early to a quick
pace, &s;o as to equal hor&s;es in the waggon, as well
as in the plough. They are u&s;ed in the Ea&s;t In|dies
for carrying burdens; and they are fitter
even than hor&s;es for that &s;ervice, the back of an
ox being convex, and con&s;equently more able to
&s;upport a weight than that of a hor&s;e. All that
is nece&s;&s;ary in the furniture for the back, is a bit
of wood or &s;tiff leather, to prevent the load from
falling down upon the neck. The only cau&s;e I
can a&s;&s;ign for preferring hor&s;es, are bad roads,
which were univer&s;al in Britain till lately. Being
impracticable for carts during winter, the farmer
carried his corn to market on hor&s;eback. A pro|per
furniture for the back of an ox was not
thought of, though an ea&s;y inven$ion. And
hor&s;es being thought nece&s;&s;ary for carrying bur|dens,
they were employed in&s;tead of oxen in e|very
work: if employed at all, they are too ex|pen&s;ive
ever to be &s;uffered to be idle. Another
circum&s;tance contributed. Becau&s;e oxen require
<PB N="33" REF="59">
no corn, it is commonly imagined that they &s;carce
require any food. They are put off during win|ter
with a bottle of dry &s;traw, which after the
turn of the year affords very little nouri&s;hment.
They become too weak for working; and yet,
in&s;tead of bettering their food, it is vainly thought
that multiplying their number in a plough will
an&s;wer; and thus may be &s;een in &s;everal places
yoked in a plough, ten or twelve weak animals
that can &s;carce &s;upport their own weight. We
are now provided with good roads every where;
and there is no longer the pretext of bad roads
for preferring hor&s;es. Corn is now carried to
market in carts, for which oxen are no le&s;s pro|per
than hor&s;es. And it is hoped, that farmers
will at la&s;t break through a bad cu&s;tom, and
open their eyes to their own intere&s;t. Nothing is
more deeply their intere&s;t than to lay a&s;ide hor|&s;es
totally in farm-operations, and to employ
oxen. The tack&s;man profits fir&s;t; but does not
the landlord gain more, by enabling his tenants
in new lea&s;es to pay a higher rent? Why then
&s;hould gentlemen loiter, while they can &s;o ea&s;ily
advance their rent without oppre&s;&s;ing their te|nants?
Why do they not encourage their te|nants
by example and precept, to follow a mode
that is equally beneficial to them&s;elves and to their
country? It will be hard indeed, if a &s;ingle te|nant
cannot be found to &s;ee his intere&s;t: if a
landlord can prevail but upon one or two of his
<PB N="34" REF="60">
tenants to take the lead, the re&s;t will naturally
follow. At any rate, he can force them to their
own good, by prohibiting hor&s;es in every new
lea&s;e. It is a &s;trange &s;ort of ambition that moves
gentlemen to &s;pend their e&s;tates in the Hou&s;e of
Commons, where mo&s;t of them are mere mutes,
in&s;tead of &s;erving their country and them&s;elves at
home, which is genuine patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>As computation is the touch&s;tone of profit and
lo&s;s, two computations are &s;ubjoined; one to &s;atisfy
the farmer of the &s;um he will &s;ave by employing
oxen in&s;tead of hor&s;es; and one to &s;hew what be|nefit
will accrue to the public by the change. To &s;et
the fir&s;t computation in a clear light, and to avoid
fractions, I make the &s;uppo&s;ition, that a hor&s;e put
to work at the age of five may endure hard work
for twelve years, which is a large allowance beyond
the truth. An ox is put to work at the age of four,
and at &s;even is in his prime, which is the proper
time to feed for the &s;hambles. The computation
accordingly is framed upon a revolution of twelve
years; during which period oxen are four times
changed without any change of hor&s;es. At the
end of the period, both mu&s;t be changed; and
a new revolution goes on as before.</P>

By this table it appears, that the yearly expence
of a farm-hor&s;e exceeds that of an ox an le&s;s than
L. 6 : 3 : 8. Now &s;uppo&s;ing four hor&s;es nece&s;|&s;ary
to a farm of 100 acres, rent L. 50 yearly,
four good oxen well fed will perform the &s;ame
work; and therefore the u&s;ing the latter in&s;tead
of the former will be an annual &s;aving of L. 24,
14 s. 8 d. very near the half of the rent. And
what will rai&s;e it above half of the rent, is the in|tere&s;t
of the money laid out, which is con&s;ider|ably
higher upon the hor&s;e than upon the ox; but
which is omitted in the foregoing table, to avoid
an intricate calculation.</P>
<P>There is be&s;ide an article that preponderates
geatly for the ox. His dung enriches the ground
on which he pa&s;tures. Hor&s;e-dung, on the con|trary,
is hurtful. This is an article of great im|portance.</P>
<P>N. B. The hay or &s;traw con&s;umed by the hor&s;e
in winter is not le&s;s than that con&s;umed by the ox;
and therefore that article is left out with re&s;pect
to both.</P>
<Q>Computation of the yearly quantity of oats con|&s;umed
in Scotland by labouring hor&s;es.</Q>
<P>FOR repairing the highways in Ea&s;t Lothian,
each ploughgate of land is rated at a certain
&s;um; and there are in the county computed to be
1331 ploughgates. In every plough four hor&s;es
<PB N="38" REF="64">
are employed; and many farmers employ addi|tional
hor&s;es for harrowing, &amp;c.; but &s;uppo&s;ing
only four, the number of farm-hor&s;es will be
5324. According to the preceding table, the yearly
quantity of corn con&s;umed by a hor&s;e is 5 bolls
2 pecks; con&s;equently the amount of the corn
con&s;umed annually is 27,285 $/2 bolls; which, com|puted
at 12 s. a-boll, a moderate price, amounts
to the &s;um of L. 16,371, 6 s. Sterling.</P>
<P>Reckoning the hor&s;es employed in all the other
corn-countries in Scotland, their number will be
at lea&s;t fifteen times as many as what are employed
in Ea&s;t Lothian. Therefore, to find out the va|lue
of the oats con&s;umed in Scotland by work|hor&s;es,
multiply the &s;aid &s;um of L. 16,371, 6 s.
Sterling by 16, which is L. 261,940, 16 s.; an
immen&s;e &s;um that would be &s;aved to this nation
by employing oxen in agriculture in&s;tead of
hor&s;es.</P>
<P>If I cannot prevail upon farmers to mind their
own intere&s;t by employing oxen in&s;tead of hor&s;es,
I &s;hall at lea&s;t make them blu&s;h, by comparing
them with farmers no le&s;s ob&s;tinate in another
particular. A farmer was brought from Norfolk
to the neighbourhood of Axmin&s;ter, who being
di&s;gu&s;ted at the hu&s;bandry practi&s;ed there, com|menced
a better plan. His fir&s;t attempt was, to
make turnip a regular crop in rotation, and to
hoe them twice in the Norfolk manner. He met
with many ob&s;tructions from perver&s;ene&s;s and auk|wardne&s;s
<PB N="39" REF="65">
of his &s;ervants; but by per&s;everance,
and working with them him&s;elf, he has prevailed.
He now for many years has had exceeding good
crops; which at the &s;ame time have improved
the &s;ucceeding crops of barley. Of the&s;e facts his
neighbours have been witne&s;&s;es near twenty years;
and yet not one of them has followed his example.
Can there be a &s;tronger in&s;tance of prejudice, or
rather &s;tupidity?</P>

<HEAD>4. WHEEL-CARRIAGES.</HEAD>
<P>WHEEL-CARRIAGES for a farm are, waggons
drawn by four hor&s;es; carts by one, two, or three
hor&s;es; coups with oxen and hor&s;es; and three-wheeled
carts with one hor&s;e. Till lately no
farm-carriages were known in Scotland, but upon
hor&s;e-back; and in many places there are no o|ther
carriages.</P>
<P>Whatever &s;trength a hor&s;e may have, yet the
weight he can draw is determined by his own
weight: in drawing, there is a certain weight
that he cannot exceed without being rai&s;ed off
the ground; and therefore, to enable him to
exert his whole &s;trength, &s;ome weight ought to
be laid on his back. Nothing is more common
than to &s;ee a carter mount the tram-hor&s;e, when
hard &s;trained in drawing up-hill. He imagines
that he has the hor&s;e more under command; but
the true rea&s;on is, that the hor&s;e draws more by
having weight on his back. In the ordinary way
of yoking two hor&s;es in a line, the tram-hor&s;e,
who is burdened with part of the weight of the
cart, draws much more than the hor&s;e before can
do. In that view, a cart with double trams, for
yoking two hor&s;es abrea&s;t, mu&s;t be an improve|ment;
becau&s;e a certain weight may be laid on
the back of each, &s;o as to enable them on occa|&s;ion
to exert their utmo&s;t &s;trength.</P>
<P>I have taken &s;ome pains to know what can be
<PB N="42" REF="68">
drawn in a cart without &s;training the hor&s;es; but
I find no uniformity. Two hor&s;es in a cart, yo|ked
in a line, u&s;ually draw, from Borrow&s;toun|ne&s;s
to Gla&s;gow, three thou&s;and weight. From
Stirling to Gla&s;gow they draw but twenty-four
hundred weight. Alexander Monteith, a carter
in the neighbourhood of Carron, has, with two
hor&s;es, repeatedly drawn from Banton, in the
pari&s;h of Kil&s;yth, to Carron, four thou&s;and four
hundred weight, each hundred weight con&s;i&s;ting
of one hundred and twenty pounds Avoirdupois.
He commonly draws thirty-&s;even or thirty-eight
hundred weight. The carts between Borrow|&s;tounne&s;s
and Gla&s;gow carry from ten to fifteen
hundred weight with a &s;ingle hor&s;e. And with the
&s;ame draught they carry about Edinburgh twelve
hundred weight of coals. They carried formerly
no more but that weight with two horfes yoked
in a line. Mr Orr of Barrowfield, for carrying
his coals to market, u&s;es &s;ingle-hor&s;e carts with
wheels &s;ix feet high. Every cart carries ea&s;ily
twenty-one hundred weight to the place of un|loading,
which is di&s;tant from the coal-pit about
two Engli&s;h miles; and this is done &s;ix times e|very
day. The inequality of the&s;e weights &s;hows
the inaccuracy of carters who have not come to
any preci&s;e knowledge of what hor&s;es can perform
in a cart. In the mean time, till more exact ex|periments
be made, we &s;hall take a middle rate,
which is the three thou&s;and weight drawn by two
hor&s;es from Borrow&s;tounne&s;s to Gla&s;gow, the half
<PB N="43" REF="69">
of which for a &s;ingle hor&s;e is fifteen hundred
weight; though, con&s;idering the weight that lies
upon the back of a &s;ingle hor&s;e in a cart, his part
of the draught may be well computed at &s;ixteen
hundred weight.</P>
<P>This leads to a compari&s;on between a waggon
and &s;ingle-hor&s;e carts of the ordinary make. To
keep within bounds, we may fairly take it for
granted, that in a well-con&s;tructed cart, a &s;ingle
hor&s;e of moderate &s;eize will command fourteen
hundred weight; con&s;equently that &s;ix hor&s;es in
&s;ix carts will draw eight thou&s;and four hundred
weight. Let us now &s;ee what is drawn in a wag|gon
with &s;ix hor&s;es. The ordinary weight in this
country are four tons, or eight thou&s;and weight;
and I am informed it is the &s;ame about London. At
that rate, &s;ix hor&s;es in &s;ix ordinary carts, draw
four hundred weight more than &s;ix hor&s;es in a
waggon. At the &s;ame time, in a turnpike-road,
a man and a boy are &s;ufficient to manage the for|mer
as well as the latter.</P>
<P>But, to carry on the compari&s;on, &s;mall carts
have another advantage, which is, that they ad|mit
high wheels; and it is ea&s;y to adju&s;t the
wheels to the height of the hor&s;e, by making the
axle go through the middle of the cart, or higher
if nece&s;&s;ary, to make the hor&s;e draw horizontally.
It is a great ca&s;e to the hor&s;e to make the axle go
through the centre of gravity; for by that means
the weight on the hor&s;e's back is the &s;ame going
<PB N="44" REF="70">
up-hill or down-hill. A waggon carrying four or
five tons, is incapable of that improvement; for
high wheels able to &s;upport &s;uch a weight, would
require a &s;trength of timber that would be in|tolerable,
e&s;pecially in going up-hill. Here ap|pears
in a con&s;picuous light the advantage of
&s;ingle carts with high wheels above a waggon.
Upon Mr Orr's practice, I take it for granted,
that with wheels &s;ix feet high, a &s;ingle hor&s;e will
carry ea&s;ily twenty-one hundred weight for a
whole &s;ea&s;on. But let us &s;tate only two thou|&s;and
weight, or a &s;ingle ton, is not the con|clu&s;ion
fair, that in &s;uch carts &s;ix hor&s;es will draw
a third more than in a waggon?</P>
<P>Thus, &s;ingle-hor&s;e carts are clearly preferable
to a waggon with re&s;pect to the burden they can
carry; and they are &s;till more preferable with re|&s;pect
to the highways. A turnpike-road would
be ea&s;ily made, and more ea&s;ily &s;upported, were
none but &s;ingle-hor&s;e carts admitted, or were the
toll doubled or tripled upon waggons. This &s;pe|culation
merits the mo&s;t &s;erious attention of the
legi&s;lature. To pre&s;erve turnpike-roads in per|fect
order, a &s;ingle act of parliament would be
&s;ufficient. The Iri&s;h have taken the lead in this
important article. We ought to follow without
a moment's delay.</P>
<P>The proportion that ought to be laid on a
hor&s;e's &s;houlders to have the greate&s;t command of
the draught, remains to be a&s;certained by experi|ments.
<PB N="45" REF="71">
But I gue&s;s, that a hor&s;e who can draw
fourteen hundred weight without any load on his
back, will with equal ca&s;e draw &s;ixteen hundred,
by laying on his back five or &s;ix &s;tone of that
weight.</P>
<P>A wheel-carriage is a great &s;aving to the farm|er,
much greater than in a cur&s;ory view will be
imagined. A cart with two hor&s;es carries five
bolls of &s;hell-lime. I talk of ordinary carts with
two hor&s;es in a line; for two hor&s;es abrea&s;t in
trams will carry much more. The &s;ame quanitity
on hor&s;eback requires &s;ix hor&s;es. To the former
one man is &s;ufficient; to the latter, one to every
two hor&s;es. Now, &s;uppo&s;ing a man and a cart with
two hor&s;es, to be hired for three &s;hillings a-day,
which is le&s;s than ordinary, the expence of the
lime on hor&s;eback is nine &s;hillings; in cart, no
more but three. Here is a &s;aving of &s;ix &s;hillings
upon every five bolls. And &s;uppo&s;ing forty-eight
cart-loads of lime to be led in a &s;ummer, which is
a moderate computation even in a farm that em|ploys
but a &s;ingle plough, the &s;aving amounts to
L. 14, 8 s. which alone is &s;ufficient to convert a
lo&s;ing farm into a profitable one. I have been a
witne&s;s to the carrying on hor&s;eback 700 loads of
coals, a man to every two hor&s;es; the expence
of which amounts to L. 52, 10 s. &s;uppo&s;ing a
man to be hired at eight pence a-day, and a hor&s;e
at fourteen pence. That quantity can be carried
in carts with two hor&s;es for L. 21 : 2 : 11. The
<PB N="46" REF="72">
&s;ame calculation is applicable to grain. A cart
with two hor&s;es will carry to market &s;ix bolls of
barley, which, when carried on hor&s;eback, re|quire
&s;ix hor&s;es. A &s;ingle plough in tolerable &s;oil
well cultivated, will afford for &s;ale a hundred bolls
of grain, which carried in carts makes a &s;aving of
L. 4 Sterling.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of a three-wheeled cart drawn by a
&s;ingle hor&s;e, is to remove earth, or to carry ma|nure
to a near field. One hor&s;e &s;erves two of
the&s;e carts: when he returns after unloading, the
other is ready filled. But this work is &s;o &s;evere
for a &s;ingle hor&s;e, that the field ought to be
&s;mooth and level; or inclining downward, which
is &s;till better.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add upon this head, that the &s;acks
commonly u&s;ed in Scotland for corn, are too
heavy. In England &s;mall &s;acks are u&s;ed, which
one man can ea&s;ily load or unload.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">FARM-OFFICES.</HEAD>
<P>IN this country there are few traces of &s;kill or
contrivance in farm-hou&s;es; no regard to a
centric &s;ituation, nor to a dry &s;pot, nor to ven|tilation.
Our farm-offices are &s;et down &s;traggling
and confu&s;ed as if by accident; here a barn,
there a &s;table. Imperfection in form is more ex|cu&s;able,
<PB N="47" REF="73">
there being few good examples to copy
from: every where to be &s;een cow-hou&s;es &s;o auk|wardly
formed, as that in order to clean them
the cattle mu&s;t be turned to the door; and &s;o
&s;trait that they mu&s;t dung upon each other. And
la&s;tly, after all the labours of the year, no place
contrived for keeping corns dry.</P>
<P>Though to a &s;tack-yard dryne&s;s of &s;ituation and
free ventilation are e&s;&s;ential; yet &s;o little are the&s;e
circum&s;tances regarded, that a &s;tack-yard is al|ways
adjacent to the dwelling-hou&s;e, whether the
&s;pot be wet or dry. It is at the &s;ame time care|fully
&s;urrounded with trees, as if to prevent ven|tilation,
and as if water dropping from the
branches on the corn-&s;tacks were &s;alutary to
them.</P>
<P>A kitchen-garden is of importance to a farm,
as will appear afterward. There is indeed always
a kitchen-garden, but very little attended to. The
chief attention is to &s;urround it with trees; and
yet the nece&s;&s;ary effect of excluding free air, is to
dwarf the plants, and to give them a bad ta&s;te.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be the opinion of our farmers, that
a dunghill cannot be too moi&s;t; for it is com|monly
put in a hole, and con&s;equently &s;urrounded
with water: the riche&s;t parts are imbibed by the
water, and both evaporate together, leaving the
dunghill little better than a <HI>caput mortuum.</HI> Wa|ter
at the &s;ame time, in any quantity, is far from
contributing to putrefaction. I have &s;een a &s;heaf
<PB N="48" REF="74">
of &s;traw, after lying &s;ix months in water, &s;o tough
as to be fit for making ropes.</P>
<P>The foregoing defects are but imperfectly re|medied
in the late&s;t con&s;tructions. The form
mo&s;t in reque&s;t is three &s;ides of a &s;quare; the hou|&s;es
for the farm-cattle on the ea&s;t, the barn on the
we&s;t, and &s;heds on the north, the dunghill occu|pying
the middle of the &s;quare. The &s;tables are
too far from the barn; the dung lies &s;cattered, and
trodden upon by the cattle; and the expence of
roofing is great.</P>
<P>The&s;e particulars are mentioned as an intro|duction
to the following plan; preferable upon two
accounts; fir&s;t, as le&s;s expen&s;ive; and next, as
more convenient. The plan is, to erect a hou&s;e of
two &s;tories, the under &s;tory for a &s;table, and the
upper for a barn. The door of the &s;table fronts
the ea&s;t; that of the barn the we&s;t, having a &s;tair
that leads up to it. The &s;tack-yard joins the
barn, with free air to the north, we&s;t, and &s;outh.
Round this building are &s;heds for cattle laid to
the walls, with roofs &s;loping from the ea&s;ing.
The &s;heds &s;hould be twelve feet wide, &s;ufficient
for the &s;ize of any farm-bea&s;t; and the outward
wall may be &s;even feet high or &s;o. There is
place for &s;ix &s;heds, one on each gable, and two
on each &s;ide-wall, leaving an interval for the
doors of the barn and &s;table.</P>
<P>There will be found a great &s;aving in this plan,
compared with the other mentioned. To form a
<PB N="49" REF="75">
ju&s;t compari&s;on, they ought to be equally capa|cious;
the two barns ought to be of the &s;ame
&s;ize, and there ought to be room for the &s;ame
number of cattle. The expence of each is an|nexed;
and the &s;aving on the plan recommended
is no le&s;s than L. 94 : 2 : 2 Sterling. This is an
important article to every gentleman who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
an e&s;tate in a corn-country; for no article is hea|vier
than the building farm-hou&s;es. Next as to
convenience. In the ordinary form, where the
barn is on one &s;ide of a court, and the &s;tables on
the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, the time con&s;umed in carrying
&s;traw to the cattle is almo&s;t entirely &s;aved in the
plan propo&s;ed; there being holes in the barn-floor
over every &s;tall, covered with a moveable board,
through which &s;traw is let down to the cattle;
and this leaves nothing to the ploughman or cart|er,
but to attend to the working of his cattle. In
general, &s;uch work ought to be avoided that mu&s;t
be left to the di&s;cretion of &s;ervants to carry on
fa&s;t or &s;low, without any effectual check. With
re&s;pect to thre&s;hing, a timber-floor has great e|la&s;ticity;
and I am made certain from experience,
that a third part more may be thre&s;hed on it than
on an earthen floor, which has no ela&s;ticity. At
the &s;ame time, the frequent &s;weeping of an earth|floor
rai&s;es the finer parts of the earth, which mix
with the grain: this is totally prevented in clean|ing
corn upon a timber-floor. Further, the damp|ne&s;s
of an earthen floor corrupts the grain; it can|not
<PB N="50" REF="76">
be kept a fortnight from vegetating, e&s;pecially if
laid up to the damp wall. Sacks give no &s;ecurity;
for they rot if allowed to &s;tand in the barn any
time. A barn in a &s;econd floor is excellent for
preventing all the&s;e evils: one end contains a
&s;tack of corn, the middle is for thre&s;hing, and the
other end for cleaning the corn when thre&s;hed.
Above this end there is a loft for holding the
cleaned corn, to which there is ea&s;y acce&s;s by a
&s;tair; and here corn may be kept in fafety for
months.</P>
<P>It will be objected again&s;t this plan, that there
is no court for a dunghill, where winterers are
commonly fed. But this I have purpo&s;ely avoid|ed;
for it will be &s;een afterwards, in the in&s;truc|tions
given for the feeding of cattle, that to keep
winterers in that manner is hurtful both to them
and to the dunghill. They will be more com|fortably
put up in &s;heds; provided only in build|ing
care be taken to give a free circulation of air.</P>
<P>One article &s;till remains, in treating of farm|offices,
which is a hou&s;e for laying up in&s;truments
of hu&s;bandry, when not employed. Few farmers
are &s;ufficiently careful about this articles: they be|have
as if in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry could be pro|cured
without pains, and without price. It is true
indeed, that the&s;e in&s;truments are generally &s;o mean
and &s;o in&s;ufficient as to de&s;erve very little care;&mdash;nothing
more common, than to be left where la&s;t
u&s;ed, open to heat and cold, drought and moi&s;ture.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="77">
To form a ju&s;t notion of the propere&s;t method
for pre&s;erving wood, I mu&s;t premi&s;e, that it will
la&s;t equally well in air and in water; but it mu&s;t
be kept con&s;tantly in the one or the other. What
de&s;troys wood is the alternate action of air and
water. Ob&s;erve a &s;take driven into the ground:
the part that con&s;umes fir&s;t, is not that within the
ground, nor that freely out of it, but the ring at
the &s;urface of the ground, to which air and moi|&s;ture
have equal acce&s;s. The &s;ame where one piece
of wood is morti&s;ed into another: the part that
decays fir&s;t, is where the two pieces join, which is
open to the air, and at the &s;ame time lodges moi|&s;ture.
The &s;ame is ob&s;erveable in the putrefaction
of a dunghill: the parts from which either air or
water is excluded, never rot. I mu&s;t premi&s;e in
the next place, that though in a morti&s;e the parts
joined rot the &s;oone&s;t, yet the mortifed part, from
which both air and water are excluded, decays
&s;ooner than that which is open to the air, &s;uppo|&s;ing
it to be kept dry.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, that to pre&s;erve wood in the
mo&s;t perfect manner, it ought to be &s;heltered from
rain, and expo&s;ed as much as po&s;&s;ible to the ven|tilation
of dry air. This &s;ugge&s;ts the be&s;t con|&s;truction
of a hou&s;e for pre&s;erving in&s;truments of
hu&s;bandry. It ought to be erected in the highe&s;t
&s;pot, free to every wind: it ought to have a roof
&s;upported on pillars; the &s;ides ought to be con|&s;tructed
like tho&s;e of a drying-hou&s;e at a bleach|field,
<PB N="52" REF="78">
with moveable boards for admitting air and
excluding rain. Three feet or &s;o may be left open
at bottom; becau&s;e &s;o low down no rain can pe|netrate
to do mi&s;chief. Need I add, that before
laying up any in&s;trument, it ought to be carefully
cleaned and dried?</P>

<P>IN preparing land for cropping, the fir&s;t thing
that occurs to the writer and to the hu&s;band|man,
is to con&s;ider the ob&s;tructions to regular
<PB N="54" REF="80">
ploughing. The mo&s;t formidable of the&s;e, are
&s;tones lying above or below the &s;urface, which are
an impediment to a plough, as rocks are to a &s;hip.
Did not cu&s;tom account for it, how &s;trange would
it appear, that few proprietors or tenants in Scot|land
think of clearing their land of &s;tones. Stones
above the &s;urface may be avoided by the plough|man,
though not without lo&s;s of ground; but
&s;tones below the &s;urface are commonly not di&s;co|vered
till the plough be &s;hattered to pieces, and
perhaps a day's work lo&s;t. The clearing land of
&s;tones is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to prevent mi&s;chief.
And to encourage the operation, it is attended with
much actual profit. Take the following particu|lars.
The &s;tones are u&s;eful for fences: when
large they mu&s;t be blown, and commonly fall into
parts proper for building. And as the blowing,
when gunpowder is furni&s;hed, does not exceed
a halfpenny for each inch that is bored, the&s;e
&s;tones come generally cheaper than to dig as
many out of the quarry. In the next place, as
the &s;oil round a large &s;tone is commonly the be&s;t
in the field, it is purcha&s;ed at a low rate by ta|king
out the &s;tone. Nor is this a trifle; for not
only is the ground lo&s;t that is occupied by a large
&s;tone, but al&s;o a con&s;iderable &s;pace round it, to
which the plough has not acce&s;s without danger.
A third advantage is greater than all the re&s;t;
which is, that the ploughing can be carried on
with much expedition, when there is no appre|hen&s;ion
<PB N="55" REF="81">
of &s;tones: in &s;tony land, the plough mu&s;t
proceed &s;o &s;low, as not to perform half of its
work.</P>
<P>To clear land of &s;tones, is in many in&s;tances
an undertaking too expen&s;ive for a tenant who has
not a very long lea&s;e. As it is profitable both to
him and to his landlord, it appears rea&s;onable
that the work &s;hould be divided, where the lea&s;e
exceeds not nineteen years. It falls naturally up|on
the landlord to be at the expence of blowing
the &s;tones, and upon the tenant to carry them off
the field.</P>
<P>It is vain to think of drawing any con&s;iderable
rent, till a farm be cleared of &s;tones. Why
then do gentlemen neglect this means of impro|ving
their land? In a lea&s;e, let it be a provi&s;o,
that the landlord or his &s;teward be adverti&s;ed of
every &s;tone that ob&s;tructs the plough. When a
number of the&s;e are marked, let an arti&s;t be em|ployed
to bore and to blow; and the landlord has
done his part. I engage that he will make twenty
<HI>per cent.</HI> of the money laid out in this operation.</P>
<P>Another ob&s;truction is wet ground. Water is
a good &s;ervant, but a bad ma&s;ter. It may improve
gravelly or &s;andy &s;oils; but it &s;ours a clay &s;oil,
and converts low ground into a mora&s;s, unfit for
any purpo&s;e that can intere&s;t the hu&s;bandman.</P>
<P>A great deal has been written upon different
methods of draining land, mo&s;tly &s;o expen&s;ive as
<PB N="56" REF="82">
to be &s;carce fit for the landlord, not to mention
the tenant.</P>
<P>One way of draining without expence when
land is to be enclo&s;ed with hedge and ditch, is to
direct the ditches &s;o as to carry off the water. But
this method is not always practicable, even where
the divi&s;ions lie convenient for it. If the run of
water be con&s;iderable, it will de&s;troy the ditches,
and lay open the fences, e&s;pecially where the &s;oil
is loo&s;e or &s;andy.</P>
<P>If ditches will not an&s;wer, hollow drains are
&s;ometimes made, and &s;ometimes open drains,
which mu&s;t be made &s;o deep as to command the
water. The former is filled up with loo&s;e &s;tones,
with bru&s;h-wood, or with any other porous mat|ter
that permits the water to pa&s;s. The latter is
left open, and not filled up. To make the former
effectual, the ground mu&s;t have &s;uch a &s;lope as to
give the water a bri&s;k cour&s;e. To execute them
in level ground in a gro&s;s error: the pa&s;&s;ages are
&s;oon &s;topped up with &s;and and &s;ediment, and the
work rendered u&s;ele&s;s. This inconvenience takes
not place in open drains: but they are &s;ubject to
other inconveniencies: They are always filling
up, to make a yearly reparation nece&s;&s;ary; and
they ob&s;truct both ploughing and pa&s;turing.</P>
<P>I venture to recommend the following drain as
the be&s;t in all views. It is an open drain made
with the plough, cleaving the &s;pace intended for
the drain over and over, till the furrow be made
<PB N="57" REF="83">
of a &s;ufficient depth for carrying off the water.
The &s;lope on either &s;ide may by repeated plough|ings
be made &s;o gentle as to give no ob&s;truction
either to the plough or to the harrow. There is
no occa&s;ion for a &s;pade, unle&s;s to &s;mooth the &s;ides
of the drain, and to remove accidental ob&s;truc|tions
in the bottom. The advantages of this
drain are manifold. It is executed at much le&s;s
expence than either of the former; and it is per|pertual,
as it never can be ob&s;tructed. In level
ground, it is true, gra&s;s may grow at the bottom
of the drain; but to clear off the gra&s;s once in
four or five years, will re&s;tore it to its original
perfection. A hollow drain may be proper be|tween
the &s;pring-head and the main drain, where
the di&s;tance is not great; but in every other ca&s;e
the drain recommended is the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Where a level field is infe&s;ted with water from
higher ground, the water ought to be intercepted
by a ditch carried along the food of the high
ground, and terminating in &s;ome capital drain.</P>
<P>The only way to clear a field of water that is
hollow in the middle, is to carry it off by &s;ome
drain &s;till lower. This is commonly the ca&s;e of
a mora&s;s fed with water from higher ground, and
kept on the &s;urface by a clay bottom.</P>
<P>A clay &s;oil of any thickne&s;s is never pe&s;tered
with &s;prings; but it is pe&s;tered with rain, which
&s;ettles on the &s;urface as in a cup. The only re|medy
is high narrow ridges, well rounded. And
<PB N="58" REF="84">
to clear the &s;urrows, the furrow of the foot-ridge
ought to be con&s;iderably lower, in order to carry
off the water cleverly. It cannot be made too
low, as nothing hurts clay &s;oil more than the &s;tag|nation
of water on it; witne&s;s the hollows at the
ends of crooked ridges, which are ab&s;olutely bar|ren.
Some gravelly &s;oils have a clay bottom,
which is a &s;ub&s;tantial benefit to a field when in
gra&s;s, as it retains moi&s;ture. But when in tillage,
ridges are nece&s;&s;ary to prevent rain from &s;ettling
at the bottom; and this is the only ca&s;e where a
gravelly &s;oil ought to be ridged.</P>
<P>Clay &s;oils that have little or no level, have &s;ome|times
a gravelly bottom. For di&s;charging the
water, the only method I can think of, is, at the
end of every ridge to pierce down to the gravel,
which will ab&s;orb the water. But if the furrow
of the foot-ridge be low enough to receive all
the water, it will be more expeditious to make a
few holes in that furrow. In &s;ome ca&s;es, a field
may be drained, by filling up the hollows with
earth taken from higher ground. But as this
method is expen&s;ive, it will only be taken where
no other method an&s;wers. Where a field hap|pens
to be partly wet, partly dry, there ought to
be a &s;eparation by a middle ridge, if it can be
done conveniently. And the dry part may be
ploughed, while the other is drying.</P>
<P>The low part of Berwick&s;hire is generally a
brick clay, extremely wet and poachy during win|ter.
<PB N="59" REF="85">
This in a good mea&s;ure may be prevented
by proper inclo&s;ing, as there is not a field but
can be drained into lower ground, all the way
down to the river Tweed. But as this would
le&s;&s;en the quantity of rain in a dry climate, &s;uch
as is all the ea&s;t &s;ide of Britain, it may admit of
&s;ome doubt whether the remedy would not be as
bad as the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Broom and whins are great ob&s;tructions to crop|ping.
Broom is an evergreen &s;hrub that thrives
be&s;t in &s;andy &s;oil; and there it grows &s;o vigo|rou&s;ly,
as &s;carce to admit any gra&s;s under it. A
plant of broom that has arrived to its full &s;ize,
dies when cut over: but this does not root out
broom, becau&s;e it grows from &s;eed lodged in the
ground; be&s;ide, that there can be no cropping
while the &s;tumps remain. An effectual way to
root out this plant, is, after cutting the great &s;tems
clo&s;e to the ground, to carry them off the field.
And the ground may be cleared of the roots, by
a Scotch plough with a &s;piked &s;ock, drawn by
two oxen and two hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The field thus cleared may bear a crop of
oats, or two; and with proper manure may be
continued in tillage, or laid down with the &s;eed
of pa&s;ture-gra&s;&s;es. The latter is preferable from
the nature of the &s;oil, which is commonly &s;andy.</P>
<P>But as the &s;eed of broom lies long in &s;uch &s;oil
without rotting, the farmer may reckon upon a
plentiful crop from the &s;eed along with the gra&s;s.
<PB N="60" REF="86">
To pull up the young broom with the hand, is an
expen&s;ive work; and for a large field it is difficult
to procure hands. Another method practi&s;ed is,
to cut the young broom with a &s;ythe. But the
broom comes up next year in double quantity;
for it &s;prings from young roots, though not from
old.</P>
<P>Sheep are fond of broom, and devour greedily
every young &s;hoot. In a pa&s;ture-field, a few
bu&s;hes make a &s;helter; and the cropping of &s;heep
prevents them in a good mea&s;ure from &s;preading.
Broom has a &s;ingular effect upon &s;heep: it makes
them drunk &s;o effectually, that when heated a
little with driving, they tumble over, and lie with|out
motion. This &s;ugge&s;ts a method of rooting
out the young broom that grows with the pa&s;ture|gra&s;&s;es,
which is to pa&s;ture the field with &s;heep.
If any e&s;cape the fir&s;t year, there will not be left
a ve&s;tige after the &s;econd. Be&s;ide the ea&s;ine&s;s of
this method, it is profitable, as there is no food
more nouri&s;hing to &s;heep than young broom.</P>
<P>Where it is nece&s;&s;ary or convenient to keep the
field in corn, hor&s;e-hoeing is the only way to &s;ub|due
broom. This fort of hu&s;bandry encourages
every &s;eed to vegetate; and the frequent plough|ings
that are nece&s;&s;ary in a drilled crop, de&s;troy
broom as well as other weeds. Some may e&s;cape
the fir&s;t year, but they cannot e&s;cape &s;ub&s;equent
hor&s;e-hoeing.</P>
<P>A whin is a fine evergreen &s;hrub, carrying a
<PB N="61" REF="87">
&s;weet-&s;melling flower all the year, except in fro&s;t.
But in hu&s;bandry, beauty is not regarded in op|po&s;ition
to profit. This &s;hrub &s;preads wonder|fully
in poor &s;oil; and when once e&s;tabli&s;hed, re|quires
both art and labour to extirpate it. The
roots of broom pu&s;h downward; and for that
rea&s;on, probably, broom &s;prings not from the
root. The roots of a whin, on the contrary, pu&s;h
horizontally, to the di&s;tance &s;ometimes of ten or
twelve feet. While the plant is growing, it
draws the whole juices from the roots; but
when cut down, the&s;e juices pu&s;h up &s;uckers from
every root that lies near the &s;urface. And hence
the difficulty of extirpating whins.</P>
<P>The be&s;t method is, to &s;et fire to the whins in a
windy day during fro&s;t. Fro&s;t has the effect to
wither whins, and to make them burn readily:
the harder the fro&s;t, the better. Cut over the
&s;tumps with a hatchet, and wait till the ground be
&s;oftened with rain. At that time, a firm plough
with a &s;trong draught, will &s;hatter all the roots
into &s;hreds, which will be brought above ground
with a heavy brake. The expence of this opera|tion
is &s;mall, compared with the common method
of rooting out whins with a hoe; and it is the
le&s;s to be grudged, as being done in wet weather,
when the plough cannot be otherwi&s;e employed.
Oxen are the fitte&s;t for this operation; becau&s;e
they make a &s;teady draught, and do not, like
<PB N="62" REF="88">
hor&s;es, give way when they meet with unexpected
re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>If the field be &s;oon laid down in gra&s;s, whins
will &s;pring up in abundance, not only from &s;eed,
but from the &s;mall fibres that may have e&s;caped
the plough and brake. Pa&s;turing with &s;heep is
the only remedy: and it is an effectual remedy,
if applied immediately after the whins &s;pring; for
&s;heep are no le&s;s fond of whins than of broom;
and if there be a &s;ufficient number, they will not
leave a &s;ingle plant above ground. Their &s;pring|ing
for years need not be repined at; for in their
infant &s;tate they are excellent food, equal to any
plant that grows. If this method be neglected
till the whins have grown into wood, &s;heep come
too late; they will feed on the tender parts, but
the bu&s;h continues healthy; of which we have ex|amples
every where in open fields.</P>
<P>But if gra&s;s be not immediately wanted, hor&s;e|hoeing
hu&s;bandry is the mo&s;t effectual method for
clearing a field from whins. And when a field is
once enriched by labour and manure, one need
not be afraid of whins, as a poor &s;oil is only pro|per
for them.</P>
<P>Whins are a food &s;o nouri&s;hing, not only to
&s;heep but to horned cattle, that a poor &s;oil cannot
be better employed than in bearing crops of them:
they are eat plea&s;antly in their infant-&s;tate, while
the prickles are yet &s;o tender as not to hurt the
mouth.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="89">
Having touched the article of food, though fo|reign
to the pre&s;ent chapter, I am excited to ob|&s;erve,
that the tops of the olde&s;t whins, cut off
with a hedge-bill, make a hearty food for cattle
when boiled. And to encrea&s;e the doze, thi&s;tles,
every bulky weed, and the roots of cabbage, may
be boiled with the whins. This I am informed is
an ordinary practice in Germany.</P>
<P>Molehills may be ju&s;tly con&s;idered as an ob|&s;truction
to cropping. It is therefore beneficial to
de&s;troy moles; and the &s;imple&s;t way is, to lay hold
of the young, which are always found in mole|hills
larger than ordinary. Buffon is uncertain
whether they breed more than once a-year; but
&s;ays, that young moles are found from April to
Augu&s;t. What I found, were generally between
the fir&s;t of May new &s;tyle and the fir&s;t of May
old &s;tyle.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>2. BRINGING INTO CULTURE LAND from the
STATE of NATURE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following method of improving a moor is
contained in a letter addre&s;&s;ed to me by an expert
farmer. &startq;I began with ploughing as much of
the moor as I had a pro&s;pect of dung for. It
was cro&s;s-ploughed next &s;pring, and well har|rowed.
About Mid&s;ummer, it was ploughed
again in the direction of the fir&s;t ploughing, and
well harrowed. It was ploughed the fourth
<PB N="64" REF="90">
time before winter, but not harrowed. It got
the fifth ploughing in the &s;ucceeding April, at
which time the &s;ward was well broken and rot|ted.
It was dunged liberally; and after plough|ing
the dung into the ground, I &s;owed turnip.
New ground, however poor originally, never
di&s;appointed me of a rich crop of turnip the fir&s;t
year, barley or oats the &s;econd, and clover and
rye-gra&s;s the third. And yet there are &s;everal
late in&s;tances of turnip failing in the be&s;t infield
grounds, among my neighbours and in my own
farm. In the year 1759, unwilling to tru&s;t the
whole of my turnip-crop to the moor, I prepared
and dunged part of my be&s;t infield, and &s;owed
it with turnip. Not a &s;ingle drill appeared from
the fir&s;t &s;owing; and but a &s;canty crop from
the third: in the moor not a &s;ingle drill failed.
I was anxious to di&s;cover the cau&s;e: I could
not attribute the difference to &s;oil or &s;ituation,
which were in favour of the infield; and the
management was the &s;ame. The black fly, it
is true, had de&s;troyed the infield crop; but I
was puzzled why they had ab&s;tained from the
moor. Upon examining narrowly the two
fields, I di&s;covered that the black flies in the
infield were young and very &s;mall, not able to
fly, but only to creep or hop about. Not a
&s;ingle fly could be &s;een in the moor. This led
me to the following &s;peculation. Nature has
taught the various tribes of flies and in&s;ects, to
<PB N="65" REF="91">
depo&s;it their eggs in places the be&s;t adapted for
the production and nouri&s;hment of their young.
Warm and rich grounds an&s;wer the&s;e purpo&s;es
the be&s;t: moor-grounds are cold and barren.
I reflected further, that when once the&s;e in&s;ects
chu&s;e for their habitation a rich &s;oil where there
is plenty of food, they depo&s;it their eggs there;
and the race is propagated from year to year.
A vacuity of ten or twelve yards in one of the
moor-drills &s;eemed not to &s;quare with my theo|ry.
But upon enquiry I found, that a &s;mall
&s;hower of rain had &s;topped the holes of the
drill-box a little time.&endq;</P>
<P>So far my corre&s;pondent. His method is good;
but it is laborious; and the &s;oil with three
ploughings may be rendered as proper for turnip,
as with the &s;ix he gave it. The following altera|tion
is what I propo&s;e. Let the moor be opened
in winter when it is wet; which has one conve|nience,
that the plough cannot be employed at
any other work. In &s;pring, after fro&s;t is over a
&s;light harrowing will fill up the &s;eams with mould,
to keep out the air and rot the &s;od. In that &s;tate
let it lie the following &s;ummer and winter, which
will rot the &s;od more than if laid open to the air
by ploughing. Next April, let it be cro&s;s-plough|ed,
braked, and harrowed, till it be &s;ufficiently
pulverized. Let the manure laid upon it, whe|ther
lime or dung, be intimately mixed with the
&s;oil by repeated harrowings. This will make a
<PB N="66" REF="92">
fine bed for the turnip-&s;eed, if &s;own broad-ca&s;t.
But if drills be intended, the method mu&s;t be
followed that is directed afterward in treating
more directly of the culture of turnip.</P>
<P>Repeated experience has convinced me, that
turnip in moori&s;h ground runs no ri&s;k from the
black fly, nor probably in any ground newly bro|ken
up. It is an old ob&s;ervation of gardeners,
that their plants thrive be&s;t in new ground; for
what other rea&s;on, than that they have no ene|mies
to de&s;troy them? It mu&s;t give plea&s;ure to
tho&s;e who wi&s;h pro&s;perity to their country, to be
informed, that moori&s;h grounds of a tolerable &s;oil
are fit for producing turnip; a profitable crop of
it&s;elf, and &s;till more profitable by preparing the
ground for &s;ub&s;equent crops. Con&s;idering the
immen&s;e quantity of moor in Scotland, it mu&s;t
give pain to think how little progre&s;s is made in
its cultivation. We &s;ee a fair example given near
twenty years ago, neither expen&s;ive nor intricate.
Why does not every farmer exert his utmo&s;t in|du&s;try
upon &s;o valuable an improvement? Cu&s;tom
fetters men in chains. To break loo&s;e from
&s;lavery, a man mu&s;t be ble&s;&s;ed by nature with a
&s;uperior degree of under&s;tanding and activity.
Such men there are, though rare: their example
will be imitated; and it is a plea&s;ing pro&s;pect, that
our barren moors will in time be converted in|to
good &s;oil, productive of nouri&s;hment for man
and bea&s;t: villages will ari&s;e, and population go
<PB N="67" REF="93">
on in a rapid cour&s;e. I pre&s;ent to the view of
my reader an immen&s;e moor between Greenlaw
in Berwick&s;hire, and Fala in Mid Lothian, as a
de&s;ireable &s;ubject for an improving farmer, now
that there is acce&s;s to lime by a turnpike-road.
As the &s;oil for the mo&s;t part is too &s;hallow for
paring and burning, it may be cultivated accor|ding
to the directions given above. At the &s;ame
time there are many &s;wampy &s;pots, which upon
paring and burning will yield a great quantity of
a&s;hes, to be laid upon the dry parts; and the&s;e
a&s;hes make the very be&s;t manure for turnip. The
method for preparing &s;wampy land for turnip is
de&s;cribed below, in treating upon the culture of
turnip. A &s;ucce&s;sful turnip-crop, fed on the
ground with &s;heep, is a fine preparation for laying
down a field with gra&s;s-&s;eeds. It is an improve|ment
upon this method, to take two or three &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive
crops of turnip, which will require no dung
for the &s;econd and following crops. This will
thicken the &s;oil, and enrich it greatly. In that
high country, where rain &s;uperabounds, the pro|fitable
crop is gra&s;s, not corn. And farms in that
country, after being improved, ought to be di|vided
into inclo&s;ures of fifty or &s;ixty acres. Sheep
require a hundred acres, to give them &s;pace for
an exten&s;ive walk; and in &s;uch an inclo&s;ure any
fence keeps them in<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Scotland probably was mo&s;tly covered with trees before the commencement of agriculture; from which we ought to expect its &s;urface to be generally vegetable &s;oil. Yet mo&s;t of it is barren earth, without any mixture of vegetable &s;oil. Did much large tracts never carry trees? I can hardly think &s;o, as trees are found growing in the mo&s;t barren &s;pots. Yet in America, which abounds with trees, one in &s;ome places may travel &s;everal hundred miles without &s;eeing a tree. This ap|pears difficult to be accounted for.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="94">
The be&s;t way of improving &s;wampy ground after
draining, is paring and burning. But where the
ground is dry, and the &s;oil &s;o thin as that the &s;urface
cannot be pared, the be&s;t way of bringing it into
tilth from the &s;tate of nature, as mentioned above,
is to plough it with a feathered &s;ock, laying the
gra&s;&s;y &s;urface under. After the new &s;urface is
mellowed with fro&s;t, fill up all the &s;eams by har|rowing
cro&s;s the field, which by excluding the
air will effectually rot the &s;od. In this &s;tate let it
lie &s;ummer and winter. In the beginning of May
after, a cro&s;s ploughing will reduce all to &s;mall
&s;quare pieces, which mu&s;t be pulverized with the
brake, and make it ready for a May or June crop.
If the&s;e &s;quare pieces be allowed to lie long in the
&s;ap without brakeing, they will become tough and
not be ea&s;ily reduced.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>3. FORMING RIDGES.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing that occurs on this head, is to
con&s;ider what grounds ought to be formed into
<PB N="69" REF="95">
ridges, and what ought to be tilled with a flat &s;ur|face.
Dry &s;oils, which &s;uffer by lack of moi|&s;ture,
ought to be tilled flat, which tends to re|tain
moi&s;ture. And the method for &s;uch tilling,
is to go round and round from the circumference
to the centre, or from the centre to the circum|ference.
This method is advantageous in point
of expedition, as the whole is fini&s;hed without
once turning the plough. At the &s;ame time, e|very
inch of the &s;oil is moved, in&s;tead of leaving
either the crown or the furrow unmoved, as is
commonly done in tilling ridges. Clay &s;oil, which
&s;uffers by water &s;tanding on it, ought to be laid
as dry as po&s;&s;ible by proper ridges. A loamy &s;oil
is the middle between the two mentioned. It
ought to be tilled flat in a dry country, e&s;pecially
if it incline to the &s;oil fir&s;t mentioned. In a moi&s;t
country, it ought to be formed into ridges, high
or low according to the degree of moi&s;ture, and
tendency to clay.</P>
<P>In grounds that require ridging, an error pre|vails,
that ridges cannot be rai&s;ed too high. High
ridges labour under &s;everal di&s;advantages. The
&s;oil is heaped upon the crown, leaving the furrows
bare: the crown is too dry, and the furrows too
wet: the crop, which is always be&s;t on the crown,
is more readily &s;haken with the wind, than where
the whole crop is of an equal height: the half of
the ridge is always covered from the &s;un, a di&s;ad|vantage
which is far from being &s;light in a cold
<PB N="70" REF="96">
climate. High ridges labour under another di&s;|advantage
in ground that has no more level than
barely &s;ufficient to carry off water: they &s;ink the
furrows below the level of the ground; and con|&s;equently
retain water at the end of every ridge.
The furrows ought never to be &s;unk below the
level of the ground. Water will more effectually
be carried off, by le&s;&s;ening the ridges both in
height and breadth: a narrow ridge, the crown
of which is but eighteen inches higher than the
furrow, has a greater &s;lope, than a very broad
ridge where the difference is three or four feet.</P>
<P>Next of forming ridges where the ground hangs
con&s;iderably. Ridges may be too &s;teep as well as
too horizontal; and if to the ridges be given all the
&s;teepne&s;s of a field, a heavy &s;hower may do irre|parable
mi&s;chief. One in&s;tance I was witne&s;s to.
A hanging field had been carefully dre&s;&s;ed with
lime and dung for turnip. The turnip was fairly
above ground, when a fatal &s;ummer-&s;hower &s;weep|ed
down turnip, lime, dung, and a quantity of
the tender &s;oil, leaving the land bare. To pre|vent
&s;uch mi&s;chief, the ridges ought to be &s;o di|rected
cro&s;s the field, as to have a gentle &s;lope for
carrying off water &s;lowly, and no more. In that
re&s;pect, a hanging field has greatly the advantage
of one that is nearly horizontal; becau&s;e in the
latter, there is no opportunity of a choice in
forming the ridges. A hill is of all the be&s;t ad|apted
for directing the ridges properly. If the &s;oil
<PB N="71" REF="97">
be gravelly, it may be ploughed round and round,
beginning at the bottom and a&s;cending gradually to
the top in a &s;piral line. This method of ploughing
a hill, requires no more force than ploughing on a
level; and at the &s;ame time removes the great in|convenience
of a gravelly hill, that rain goes off
too quickly; for the rain is retained in every fur|row.
If the &s;oil be &s;uch as to require ridges, they
may be directed to any &s;lope that is proper.</P>
<P>In order to form a field into ridges that has not
been formerly cultivated, the rules mentioned are
ea&s;ily put in execution. But what if ridges be
already formed, that are either crooked or too
high? After &s;eeing the advantage of forming a
field into ridges, people were naturally led into an
error, that the higher the better. But what could
tempt them to make their ridges crooked? I an|&s;wer,
Not of de&s;ign, but by the lazine&s;s of the dri|ver
&s;uffering the cattle to turn too ha&s;tily, in&s;tead
of making them fini&s;h the ridge without turning.
There is more than one di&s;advantage in this &s;lo|venly
practice. Fir&s;t, the water is kept in by the
curve at the end of every ridge, and &s;ours the
ground. Next, as a plough has the lea&s;t friction
po&s;&s;ible in a &s;traight line, the friction mu&s;t be in|crea&s;ed
in a curve, the back part of the mould|board
pre&s;&s;ing hard on the one hand, and the
coulter pre&s;&s;ing hard on the other. In the third
place, the plough moving in a &s;traight line, has
the greate&s;t command in laying the earth over.
<PB N="72" REF="98">
But where the &s;traight line of the plough is ap|plied
to the curvature of a ridge in order to
heighten it by gathering, the earth moved by the
plough is continually falling back, in &s;pite of the
mo&s;t &s;kilful ploughman.</P>
<P>The inconveniencies of ridges high and crook|ed,
are &s;o many, that one would be tempted to
apply a remedy at any ri&s;k. And yet, if the &s;oil
be clay, I would not advi&s;e a tenant to apply the
remedy upon a lea&s;e &s;horter than two nineteen
years. In a dry gravelly &s;oil, the work is not
difficult, nor hazardous. When the ridges are
cleaved two or three years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the cour&s;e
of cropping, the operation ought to be concluded
in one &s;ummer. The earth, by reiterated plough|ings,
&s;hould be accumulated upon the furrows, &s;o
as to rai&s;e them higher than the crowns: they
cannot be rai&s;ed too high, for the accumulated
earth will &s;ub&s;ide by its own weight. Cro&s;s-plough|ing
once or twice, will reduce the ground to a flat
&s;urface, and give opportunity to form ridges at
will. The &s;ame method brings down ridges in
clay &s;oil: only let care be taken to carry on the
work with expedition; becau&s;e a hearty &s;hower
before the new ridges are formed, would &s;oak
the ground in water, and make the farmer &s;u&s;|pend
his work for the remainder of that year at
lea&s;t. In a &s;trong clay, I would not venture to
alter the ridges, unle&s;s it can be done to perfec|tion
in one &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="99">
In the operation of flattening ridges, there is a
circum&s;tance that has &s;carce ever been attended
to. Ridges are evidently an improvement of
art; and &s;o is manure. The &s;oil mu&s;t have been
exhau&s;ted by frequent cropping before either
ridges or dung were attempted; and after ridges
were formed, the &s;oil under the crowns mu&s;t
have continued in its exhau&s;ted &s;tate, being de|prived
of the benefit both of &s;un and rain. We
find the&s;e conjectures verified by experience.
When a ridged field is made level as originally,
the &s;oil immediately under the crown, which had
the thicke&s;t covering, is commonly exceedingly
poor. Farmers, &s;en&s;ible of this, never fail to give
more dung to that part than to the re&s;t of the
field. But a more effectual remedy is, to pierce
deeper than the original &s;urface with the &s;pade or
plough, in order to bring up virgin &s;oil. This
&s;oil is generally good; and the whole is made e|qually
fertile, by mixing it with the exhau&s;ted
&s;oil in cro&s;s ploughing and harrowing. In the
low country of Berwick&s;hire, I frequently u&s;ed
this remedy, and never was di&s;appointed. In
making ditches there for draining, I have brought
up a brick-clay lying four feet under the &s;urface,
which, without being mellowed either by &s;un or
fro&s;t, carried oats of a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ize. Wild
plants may be &s;een every where much larger than
ordinary, growing even in gravel thrown up from
the bottom of a new-made ditch.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="100">
Let it be a rule, to direct the ridges north and
&s;outh if the ground will permit. In this direc|tion,
the ea&s;t and we&s;t &s;ides of the ridges, divi|ding
the &s;un equally between them, will ripen at the
&s;ame time.</P>
<P>It is a great advantage in agriculture, to form
ridges &s;o narrow, and &s;o low, as to admit the
crowns and furrows to be changed alternately
every crop. The &s;oil neare&s;t the &s;urface is the
be&s;t; and by &s;uch ploughing, it is always kept
near the &s;urface, and never buried. In high
ridges, the &s;oil is accumulated at the crown, and
the furrows left bare. Such alteration of crown
and furrow, is ea&s;y where the ridges are no more
but &s;even or eight feet broad. This mode of
ploughing an&s;wers perfectly well in &s;andy and
gravelly &s;oils, and even in loam. But it is not
&s;afe in clay &s;oil. In that &s;oil, the ridges ought
to be twelve feet wide and twenty inches high;
to be pre&s;erved always in the &s;ame form by ca&s;t|ing,
that is, by ploughing two ridges together,
beginning at the furrow that &s;eparates them, and
ploughing round and round till the two ridges be
fini&s;hed. By this method, the &s;eparating &s;urrow
is rai&s;ed a little higher than the furrows that
bound the two ridges. But at the next plough|ing,
that inequality is corrected, by beginning at
the bounding furrows, and going round and
round till the ploughing of the two ridges be com|pleted
at the &s;eparating &s;urrow.</P>

<PB N="75" REF="101">
<HEAD>4. CLEARING GROUND of WEEDS.</HEAD>
<P>THE farmer views plants in a very different
light from the botani&s;t. All are weeds with the
farmer that give ob&s;truction to the plants he pro|pagates
in his farm. The&s;e I di&s;tingui&s;h into two
kinds, that require different management, viz.&mdash;annuals,&mdash;and
all that have a longer exi&s;tence,
which I &s;hall comprehend under the general
name of <HI>pereimials.</HI> It is vain to expect a
crop of corn from land over-run with couch-gra&s;s,
knot-gra&s;s, or other perennial weeds; and yet
the time may be remembered, when, among
Scotch farmers, it was a di&s;puted point, whether
&s;uch weeds were not more profitable than hurtful.
Some found them profitable in binding their
light land: the getting a plentiful crop of &s;traw
and hay for their cattle, weighed with others. I
&s;hould be a&s;hamed of expo&s;ing ignorance &s;o gro&s;s
in my countrymen, could I not &s;ay, that they
now under&s;tand the matter better, though few of
them hitherto have arrived at the perfection of
cleaning. Summer-fallow is the general method;
and excellent it is, though it doth not always
prove effectual. The roots of couch-gra&s;s in par|ticular
are long, and full of juice: if a &s;ingle joint
be left in the ground, it never fails to &s;pring.
Here the common harrow is of very little u&s;e, its
teeth being too wide. The time relied on by our
<PB N="76" REF="102">
farmers for de&s;troying couch-gra&s;s, is in preparing
for barley. After the harrow has rai&s;ed part of a
root above ground, men, women, and children,
are employed to pull it up. There are only two
objections to this method: the expence is one;
and another is, that after all this expence, many
roots are left in the ground. In order to pave
the way for rooting out perennials effectually, and
with little expence, I take liberty to introduce a
new in&s;trument, which I term a <HI>cleaning har|row.</HI>
It is of one entire piece, like the fir&s;t of
tho&s;e mentioned above, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;even bulls,
four feet long each, two and one fourth inches
broad, two and three fourths deep. The bulls
are united together by &s;heths, &s;imilar to what are
mentioned above. The intervals between the
bulls being three and three fourths inches, the
breadth of the whole harrow is three feet five
inches. In each bull are in&s;erted eight teeth,
each nine inches free below the wood, and di|&s;tant
from each other &s;ix inches. The weight of
each tooth is a pound, or near it. The whole is
firmly bound by an iron plate from corner to cor|ner
in the line of the draught. The re&s;t as in
the harrows mentioned above. The &s;ize, how|ever,
is not invariable. The cleaning harrow
ought to be larger or le&s;s according as the &s;oil
is &s;tiff or free. See the figure annexed.</P>
<P>To give this in&s;trument its full effect, &s;tones
of &s;uch a &s;ize as not to pa&s;s freely between the
<PB N="77" REF="103">
teeth, ought to be carried off, and clods of that
&s;ize ought to be broken. The ground ought to
be dry, which it is commonly in the month of
May.</P>
<P>In preparing for barley, turnip, or other &s;um|mer-crop,
begin with ploughing and cro&s;s-plough|ing.
If the ground be not &s;ufficiently pulverized,
let the great brake be applied, to be followed &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively
with the harrows, N^O 1. and N^O 2. In
&s;tiff &s;oil rolling may be proper, once or twice be|tween
the acts. The&s;e operations will loo&s;en e|very
root, and bring &s;ome of them to the &s;urface.
This is the time for the harrow, N^O 3. conducted
by a boy mounted on one of the hor&s;es, who trots
&s;martly along the field, and brings all the roots to
the &s;urface: there they are to lie for a day or two
till perfectly dry. If any &s;tones or clods remain,
they mu&s;t be carried off in a cart. And now &s;uc|ceeds
the operation of the cleaning harrow. It
is drawn by a &s;ingle hor&s;e, directed by reins,
which the man at the oppo&s;ite corner puts over
his head, in order to have both hands free. In
this corner is fixed a rope, with which the man
from time to time rai&s;es the harrow from the
ground, to let the weeds drop. For the &s;ake of
expedition, the weeds ought to be dropt in a
&s;traight line cro&s;s the field, whether the harrow
be full or not; and &s;eldom is a field &s;o dirty but
that the harrow may go thirty yards before the
teeth are filled. The weeds will be thus laid in
<PB N="78" REF="104">
parallel rows, like tho&s;e of hay raked together
for drying. A harrow may be drawn &s;wiftly a|long
the rows, in order to &s;hake out all the du&s;t;
and then the weeds may be carried clean off the
field in carts. But we are not yet done with the&s;e
weeds: in&s;tead of burning, which is the ordinary
practice, they may be converted into u&s;eful ma|nure,
by laying them in a heap with a mixture of
hot dung to begin fermentation. What better
politic than to make a friend of a foe! At fir&s;t
view, this way of cleaning land will appear ope|ro&s;e;
but upon trial, neither the labour nor ex|pence
will be found immoderate. So far from it,
that I believe it will not be ea&s;y to name any other
way of cleaning ground effectually, that co&s;ts &s;o
little. At any rate, the labour and expence
ought not to be grudged; for if a field be once
thoroughly cleaned, the &s;ea&s;ons mu&s;t be very
cro&s;s, or the farmer very indolent, to make it ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to renew the operation in le&s;s than twenty
years. In the wor&s;t &s;ea&s;ons, &agrave; few years pa&s;ture
is always under command; which effectually de|&s;troys
triennial plants, &s;uch as thi&s;tles and couch|gra&s;s.</P>
<P>Fog is one of the mo&s;t pernicious weeds that
enter into a gra&s;s-field: in a very dry &s;oil, it u&s;urps
upon the good plants, wears them out, and co|vers
the whole &s;urface. I have tried lime and
dung to very little purpo&s;e. Coal-a&s;hes do better:
they keep back the fog a few years; but it reco|vers
<PB N="79" REF="105">
&s;trength gradually as the a&s;hes lo&s;e their in|fluence,
and prevails as much as before. Some
writers talk of rolling, becau&s;e fog is never &s;een
on a foot-path. They do not advert, that the
continual treading of feet on a narrow path, con|&s;olidates
the ground more, and makes it more
retentive of moi&s;ture, than rolling can do. Nor
do they advert, that fog is the mo&s;t plentiful in
dry ground, where the weightie&s;t roller makes no
impre&s;&s;ion. As fog pro&s;pers the mo&s;t on the
drie&s;t ground, the laying the field under water a
whole winter, will de&s;troy it. There is rea&s;on how|ever
to &s;u&s;pect, that the fog will encroach again,
when the moi&s;ture is exhau&s;ted, and the &s;oil returns
to its arid &s;tate; not to mention the many fields
that lie out of the reach of water. One infallible
method there is; which is, to cover the ground an
inch thick with &s;oil retentive of moi&s;ture, and to
mix it with the original &s;oil by the plough and har|row.
Thus will fog be bani&s;hed, and the &s;oil at
the &s;ame time enriched. But the good &s;oil here
mu&s;t be at hand: it would be too expen&s;ive to
bring it from a di&s;tance. Lucky it is, after
all, that there &s;till remains an infallible method,
which, in&s;tead of being expen&s;ive, is extremely
profitable. It will be made evident afterward, in
laying down rules for rotation of crops, that a
quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of corn and gra&s;s, is more profit|able,
than to allow any ground to continue long
in either. Therefore, as &s;oon as fog begins to
<PB N="80" REF="106">
prevail, plough up the ground for a crop of
corn<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The following method is propo&s;ed by Dr Home for de&s;troying $og. &startq;Shut up the inclo&s;ure from the mid|dle of May till the beginning of December: feed it till April, and then &s;ave it for a crop of hay. The fog, being &s;o long covered with gra&s;s, is cut off from the benefit of the air, and dies.&endq; I doubt. Over|&s;hadowing the fog may retard its progre&s;s; but as it does not correct the dryne&s;s of the &s;oil, it is not likely to extirpate the fog.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Next, of annual weeds, which are propagated
by &s;eed. As $eeds cannot be gathered out of the
ground like roots, the only way of de&s;troying
them, is to promote their vegetation; which lays
them open to be extirpated by the plough or har|row.
For want of indu&s;try, annual weeds pre|vail
in many parts of this i&s;land, in the be&s;t &s;oils
e&s;pecially. To view a crop near a town, end of
May or beginning of June, one would believe it
to be a crop of charlock or wild mu&s;tard. The&s;e
plants, it is true, lo&s;e their &s;plendid appearance
after their flowering is over; but they remain to
encumber the ground. As they ripen, and drop
their feed long before the corn is ripe, they mul|tiply
more and more. They not only rob the
ground, and &s;tarve the good grain, but prevent
circulation of air about the roots, which is a great
impediment to vegetation. Freedom of circula|tion
is one of the cau&s;es that make drilled crops
&s;ucceed &s;o well. What mu&s;t have been the con|dition
<PB N="81" REF="107">
of corn-land in Scotland before fallowing
was known!</P>
<P>And now to the de&s;truction of &s;uch weeds.
Summer-fallow, among its other advantages, does
this effectually, by ob&s;erving the following me|thod.
Begin with ploughing in April as &s;oon as the
ground is dry; and let the brake &s;ucceed cro&s;s the
field; which by pulveri&s;ing the &s;oil, will promote
the vegetation of every &s;eed. As &s;oon as the
weeds appear, which may be in ten or twelve days
according to the &s;ea&s;on, plough and brake as be|fore:
the plough will make many &s;eeds vegetate;
the brake &s;till more. Proceed in the &s;ame cour&s;e
while any weeds appear. In the heat of &s;ummer,
rolling not only promotes vegetation by keeping
in the moi&s;ture, but brui&s;es the clods which lock
up many &s;eeds.</P>
<P>This proce&s;s requires the following precaution.
Avoid ploughing or brakeing when the ground is
wet. The &s;tirring wet ground hardens it, ex|cludes
the &s;un and air, and prevents vegetation.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">CULTURE OF PLANTS FOR FOOD.</HEAD>
<P>THE articles hitherto in&s;i&s;ted on, are all of
them preparatory to the capital object of a
farm, that of rai&s;ing plants for the nouri&s;hment of
<PB N="82" REF="108">
man, and of other animals. The&s;e are of two
kinds; culmiferous, and leguminous, differing
widely from each other. Wheat, rye, barley,
oats, ryegra&s;s, are of the fir&s;t kind: of the other
kind are pea&s;e, beans, clover, cabbage, and many
others. Culmiferous plants, &s;ays Bonnet, have
three &s;ets of roots. The fir&s;t i&s;&s;ue from the &s;eed,
and pu&s;h to the &s;urface an upright &s;tem; an|other
&s;et i&s;&s;ue from a knot in that &s;tem; and a
third, from another knot, nearer the &s;urface.
Hence the advantage of laying &s;eed &s;o deep in the
ground as to afford &s;pace for all the &s;ets. Legu|minous
plants form their roots differently. Pea&s;e,
beans, cabbage, have &s;tore of &s;mall roots, all i&s;|&s;uing
from the &s;eed, like the undermo&s;t &s;et of cul|miferous
roots; and they have no other roots.
A potato and a turnip have bulbous roots. Red
clover has a &s;trong tap-root. The difference be|tween
culmiferous and leguminous plants with re|&s;pect
to the effects they produce in the &s;oil, will
be in&s;i&s;ted on afterward, in the chapter concerning

<HEAD>1. WHEAT and RYE.</HEAD>
<P>ANY time from the middle of April to the
middle of May, the fallowing for wheat may com|mence.
The moment &s;hould be cho&s;en, when
the ground, beginning to dry, has yet &s;ome re|maining
&s;oftne&s;s: in that condition, the &s;oil di|vides
ea&s;ily by the plough, and falls into &s;mall
parts. This is an e&s;&s;ential article, de&s;erving the
&s;tricte&s;t attention of the farmer. Ground plough|ed
too wet, ri&s;es, as we &s;ay, <HI>whole-fur,</HI> as when
pa&s;ture-ground is ploughed: where ploughed too
dry, it ri&s;es in great lumps, which are not redu|ced
by &s;ub&s;equent ploughings; not to mention,
that it requires double force to plough ground too
dry, and that the plough is often broken to pieces.
When the ground is in proper order, the farmer
can have no excu&s;e for delaying a &s;ingle minute.
This fir&s;t cour&s;e of fallow, mu&s;t, it is true, yield
to the barley-&s;eed; but as the barley-&s;eed is com|monly
over the fir&s;t week of May, or &s;ooner, the
<PB N="84" REF="110">
&s;ea&s;on mu&s;t be unfavourable if the fallow cannot
be reached by the middle of May.</P>
<P>As clay &s;oil requires high ridges, the&s;e ought
to be cleaved at the fir&s;t ploughing, beginning at
the furrow, and ending at the crown. This
ploughing ought to be as deep as the &s;oil will ad|mit;
and water-furrowing ought in&s;tantly to fol|low:
for if rain happen before water-furrowing, it
&s;tagnates in the furrow, nece&s;&s;arily delays the &s;e|cond
ploughing till that part of the ridge be dry,
and prevents the furrow from being mellowed, and
roa&s;ted by the &s;un. If this fir&s;t ploughing be well
executed, annual weeds will ri&s;e in plenty. A|bout
the fir&s;t week of June, the great brake will
loo&s;en and reduce the &s;oil, encourage a &s;econd
crop of annuals, and rai&s;e to the &s;urface the roots
of weeds moved by the plough. Give the weeds
time to &s;pring, which may be in two or three
weeks. Then proceed to the &s;econd ploughing
about the beginning of July; which mu&s;t be cro&s;s
the ridges, in order to reach all the &s;lips of the for|mer
ploughing. By cro&s;s-ploughing, the furrows
will be filled up, and water-furrowing be &s;till
more nece&s;&s;ary than before. Employ the brake
again about the 10th of Augu&s;t, to de&s;troy the
annuals that have &s;prung &s;ince the la&s;t &s;tirring.
The de&s;truction of weeds is a capital article in fal|lowing:
yet &s;o blind are people to their intere&s;t,
that nothing is more common, than a fallow field
covered with charlock and wild mu&s;tard, all in
<PB N="85" REF="111">
flower, and ten or twelve inches high. The field
having now received two harrowings and two
brakeings, is prepared for manure, whether lime
or dung, which without delay ought to be incor|porated
with the &s;oil, by repeated harrowing and
a gathering furrow. This ought to be about the
beginning of September; and as &s;oon after as you
plea&s;e the &s;eed may be &s;own.</P>
<P>As in ploughing a clay &s;oil it is of importance
to prevent poaching, the hinting furrows ought to
be done with two hor&s;es in a line. If four ploughs
be employed in the &s;ame field, to one of them
may be allotted the care of fini&s;hing the hinting
furrows. What will one think, who has never
been in the Highlands, of four hor&s;es abrea&s;t in
a plough, the driver going backward, and &s;triking
the hor&s;es on the head to make them come for|ward?
The ignorant and illiterate are &s;trangely
dull in point of invention: but let the mo&s;t &s;tupid
practice turn once cu&s;tomary, and it is rivetted in
them for ever. Is it not obvious, that four hor&s;es
abrea&s;t mu&s;t tread down the new-moved &s;oil, and
reduce it to as firm a &s;tate as before the plough
entered?</P>
<P>Next of dre&s;&s;ing loam for wheat. Loam, being
a medium between &s;and and clay, is of all &s;oils
the fitte&s;t for culture, and the lea&s;t &s;ubject to
chances. It does not hold water like clay; and
when wet it dries &s;ooner. At the &s;ame time it
is more retentive than &s;and of that degree of moi|&s;ture
<PB N="86" REF="112">
which promotes vegetation. On the other
hand, it is more &s;ubject to couch-gra&s;s than clay,
and to other weeds; to de&s;troy which, fallowing
is &s;till more nece&s;&s;ary than in clay.</P>
<P>Beginning the fallow about the fir&s;t of May, or
as &s;oon as barley-&s;eed is over, take as deep a fur|row
as the &s;oil will admit. Where the ridges are
&s;o low and narrow as that the crown and furrow
can be changed alternately, there is little or no
occa&s;ion for water-furrowing. Where the ridges
are &s;o high as to make it proper to cleave them,
water-furrowing is proper. The &s;econd plough|ing
may be at the di&s;tance of five weeks. Two
crops of annuals may be got in the interim, the
fir&s;t by the brake, and the next by the harrow;
and by the &s;ame means eight crops may be got in
the &s;ea&s;on. The ground mu&s;t be cleared of
couch-gra&s;s and knot-gra&s;s roots, by the cleaning
harrow, de&s;cribed above. The time for this o|peration
is immediately before the manure is laid
on. The ground at that time being in its loo&s;e&s;t
&s;tate, parts with its gra&s;s-roots more freely than
at any other time. After the manure is &s;pread,
and incorporated with the &s;oil by brakcing or har|rowing,
the &s;eed may be &s;own under &s;urrow, if
the ground hang &s;o as ea&s;ily to carry off the moi|&s;ture.
To leave it rough without harrowing, has
two advantages: it is not apt to cake with moi|&s;ture;
and the inequalities make a &s;ort of &s;helter
to the young plants again&s;t fro&s;t. But if it lie
<PB N="87" REF="113">
flat, it ought to be &s;moothed with a &s;light harrow
after the &s;eed is &s;own, which will facilitate the
cour&s;e of the rain from the crown to the furrow.</P>
<P>A &s;andy &s;oil is too loo&s;e for wheat. The only
chance for a crop is after red clover, the roots of
which bind the &s;oil; and the in&s;tructions above
given for loam are applicable here. Rye is a
crop much fitter for &s;andy &s;oil than wheat; and
like wheat it is generally &s;own after a &s;ummer|fallow.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Sow wheat as &s;oon in the month of Oc|tober
as the ground is ready. When &s;own a
month more early, it is too forward in the &s;pring,
and apt to be hurt by fro&s;t: when &s;own a month
later, it has not time to root before fro&s;t comes
on, and fro&s;t &s;pews it out of the ground.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>2. OATS.</HEAD>
<P>As winter-ploughing enters into the culture of
oats, I mu&s;t remind the reader of the effect of
fro&s;t upon tilled land. Providence has neglected
no region intended for the habitation of man. If
in warm climates the &s;oil be meliorated by the
&s;un, it is no le&s;s meliorated by fro&s;t in cold cli|mates.
Fro&s;t acts upon water, by expanding it
into a larger &s;pace. Fro&s;t has no effect upon dry
earth; witne&s;s &s;and, upon which it makes no im|pre&s;&s;ion.
But upon wet earth it acts mo&s;t vigor|ou&s;ly:
it expands the moi&s;ture, which requiring
<PB N="88" REF="114">
more &s;pace, puts every particle of the earth out
of its place, and &s;eparates them from each other.
In that view, fro&s;t may be con&s;idered as a plough
&s;uperior to any that is made, or can be made,
by the hand of man: its action reaches the mi|nute&s;t
particles; and, by dividing and &s;eparating
them, it renders the &s;oil loo&s;e and friable. This
operation is the mo&s;t remarkable in tilled land,
which gives free acce&s;s to fro&s;t. With re&s;pect to
clay &s;oil in particular, there is no rule in hu&s;ban|dry
more e&s;&s;ential than to open it before winter
in hopes of fro&s;t. It is even advi&s;eable in a clay
&s;oil to leave the &s;tubble rank, which, when
ploughed in before winter, keeps the clay loo&s;e,
and admits the fro&s;t into every eranny.</P>
<P>To apply this doctrine, it is dangerous to plough
clay &s;oil when wet; becau&s;e water is a cement
for clay, and binds it &s;o as to render it unfit for
vegetation. It is however le&s;s dangerous to
plough wet clay before winter than after. A &s;uc|ceeding
fro&s;t corrects the bad effects of &s;uch
ploughing: a &s;ucceeding drought encrea&s;es them.
No rule is &s;o ea&s;y to be followed as what I am in|culcating;
and yet no other is &s;o frequently tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed.
Many farmers have a &s;ort of ba&s;tavd
indu&s;try, that prompts activity without over think|ing
of con&s;equences.</P>
<P>And now to the culture of oats, a culmiferous
plant. The common method is, to &s;ow them on
new-ploughed land in the month of March, as
<PB N="89" REF="115">
&s;oon as the ground is tolerably dry. If it conti|nue
wet all the month of March, it is too late to
venture them after. It is much better to &s;ummer-fallow
and to &s;ow wheat in the autumn. But the
preferable method, e&s;pecially in clay &s;oil, is to
turn over the field after harve&s;t, and to lay it o|p$n
to the influences of fro&s;t and air, which le&s;&s;en
the tenacity of clay, and reduce it to a free mould.
The &s;urface-&s;oil by this means is finely mellowed
for neception of the &s;eed; and it would be a pity
to bury it by a &s;econd ploughing before &s;owing.
In general, the bulk of clay &s;oils are rich; and
&s;kilful ploughing without dung, will probably give
a better crop than un&s;kilful ploughing with dung.</P>
<P>Hitherto of natural clays. I mu&s;t add a word
of car&s;e clays which are artificial, whether left by
the &s;ea, or &s;weeped down from higher grounds
by rain. The method commonly u&s;ed of dre&s;&s;ing
car&s;e clay for oats, is, not to &s;tir it till the ground
be dry in the &s;pring, which &s;eldom happens be|fore
the fir&s;t of March; and the &s;eed is &s;own as
&s;oon after as the ground is &s;ufficiently dry for its
reception. Fro&s;t has a &s;tronger effect on &s;uch
clays than on natural clay. And if the field be laid
open before winter, it is rendered &s;o loo&s;e by fro&s;t
as to be &s;oon drenched in water. The particles
at the &s;ame time are &s;o &s;mall, as that the fir&s;t
drought in &s;pring makes the &s;urface cake or cru&s;t.
The difficulty of reducing this cru&s;t into mould
for covering the oat-&s;eed, has led farmers to de|lay
<PB N="90" REF="116">
ploughing till the month of March. But we
are taught by experience, that this &s;oil ploughed
before winter, is &s;ooner dry than when the plough|ing
is delayed till &s;pring; and as early &s;owing is
a great advantage, the objection of the &s;uperficial
cru&s;ting is ea&s;ily removed by the harrow, N^O 1.
above de&s;cribed, which will produce abundance
of mould for covering the &s;eed. The ploughing
before winter not only procures early &s;owing, but
has another advantage: the &s;urface-&s;oil that had
been mellowed during winter by the &s;un, fro&s;t,
and wind, is kept above. I have no experience
of managing car&s;e clay in this manner; but to me
it appears greatly preferable to the common prac|tice.</P>
<P>The dre&s;&s;ing a loamy &s;oil for oats, differs little
from dre&s;&s;ing a clay &s;oil, except in the following
particular, that being le&s;s hurt by rain, it requires
not high ridges; and therefore ought to be
ploughed crown and furrow alternately.</P>
<P>Where there is both clay and loam in a farm,
it is obvious from what is &s;aid above, that the
ploughing of the clay after harve&s;t, ought fir&s;t to
be di&s;patched. If both cannot be overtaken that
&s;ea&s;on, the loam may be delayed till the &s;pring
with le&s;s hurt.</P>
<P>Next of a gravelly &s;oil; which is the rever&s;e of
clay, as it never &s;uffers but from want of moi|&s;ture.
Such a &s;oil ought to have no ridges; but
ploughed circularly from the centre to the cir|cumference,
<PB N="91" REF="117">
or from the circumference to the
centre. It ought to be tilled after harve&s;t; and
the fir&s;t dry weather in &s;pring ought to be laid
hold of to &s;ow, harrow, and roll; which will pre|&s;erve
it in &s;ap.</P>
<P>The culture of oats is the &s;imple&s;t of all. That
grain is probably a native of Britain: it will grow
on the wor&s;t &s;oil with very little preparation. For
that rea&s;on, before turnip was introduced, it
was always the fir&s;t crop upon land broken
up from the &s;tate of nature.</P>
<P>Upon &s;uch land, may it not be a good method,
to build up on the crown of every ridge, in the
form of a wall, all the &s;urface-earth, one &s;od a|bove
another, as in a fold for &s;heep? After &s;tand|ing
in this form all the &s;ummer and winter, let the
walls be thrown down, and the ground prepared
for oats. This will &s;ecure one or two good crops;
after which the land may be dunged for a crop of
barley and gra&s;s-&s;eeds. This method may an&s;wer
in a farm where manure is &s;canty.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>3. BARLEY.</HEAD>
<P>BARLEY is a culmiferous plant that requires a
mellow &s;oil. Upon that account, extraordinary
care is requi&s;ite where it is to be &s;own in clay.
The land ought to be &s;tirred immediately after
the foregoing crop is removed, which lays it o|pen
to be mellowed with the fro&s;t and air. In
<PB N="92" REF="118">
that view, a peculiar &s;ort of ploughing has been
introduced, termed <HI>ribbing;</HI> by which the great|e&s;t
quantity of &s;urface po&s;&s;ible is expo&s;ed to the
air and fro&s;t. The obvious objection to this me|thod
is, that half of the ridge is left unmoved.
And to obviate that objection, I offer the follow|ing
method, which moves the whole &s;oil, and at
the &s;ame time expo&s;es the &s;ame quantity of &s;ur|face
to the fro&s;t and air. This I e&s;teem a valuable
improvement; and I am only in pain about ma|king
it to be clearly under&s;tood. As &s;oon as the
former crop is off the field, let the ridges be ga|thered
with as deep a furrow as the &s;oil will ad|mit,
beginning at the crown and ending at the
furrows. This ploughing loo&s;ens the whole &s;oil,
giving free acce&s;s to the air and fro&s;t. Soon af|ter,
begin a &s;econd ploughing in the following
manner. Let the field be divided by parallel
lines cro&s;s the ridges, with intervals of thirty feet
or &s;o. Plough once round an interval, begin|ning
at the edges, and turning the earth toward
the middle of the interval; which covers a foot
or &s;o of the ground formerly ploughed. Within
that foot plough another round &s;imilar to the for|mer;
and after that other rounds, till the whole
interval be fini&s;hed, ending at the middle. In|&s;tead
of beginning at the edges, and ploughing
toward the middle, it will have the &s;ame effect to
begin at the middle and to plough toward the
edges. Plough the other intervals in the &s;ame
<PB N="93" REF="119">
manner. As by this operation the furrows of the
ridges will be pretty much filled up, let them be
cleared and water-furrowed without delay. By
this method, the field will be left waving like a
plot in a kitchen-garden, ridged up for winter. In
this form, the field is kept perfectly dry; for be|&s;ide
the capital furrows that &s;eparate the ridges,
every ridge has a number of cro&s;s furrows that
carry the rain in&s;tantly to the capital furrows. In
hanging grounds retentive of moi&s;ture, the paral|lel
lines above mentioned ought not to be perpen|dicular
to the furrows of the ridges, but to be
directed a little downward, in order to carry rain|water
the more ha&s;tily to the&s;e furrows. If the
ground be clean, it may lie in that &s;tate winter
and &s;pring, till the time of &s;eed-furrowing. If
weeds happen to ri&s;e, they mu&s;t be de&s;troyed by
ploughing, or brakeing, or both; for there can|not
be wor&s;e hu&s;bandry, than to put &s;eed into dir|ty
ground.</P>
<P>This method re&s;embles common ribbing in ap|pearance,
but is very different in reality. As the
common ribbing is not preceded by a gathering
furrow, the half of the field is left untilled, com|pact
as when the former crop was removed, im|pervious
in a great mea&s;ure to air or fro&s;t. The
common ribbing at the &s;ame time lodges the rain|water
on every ridge, preventing it from de&s;cend|ing
to the furrows; which is hurtful in all &s;oils,
and poi&s;onous in a clay &s;oil. The &s;titching here
<PB N="94" REF="120">
de&s;cribed, or ribbing if you plea&s;e to call it
&s;o, prevents the&s;e noxious effects. By the two
ploughings the whole &s;oil is opened, admitting
freely air and fro&s;t; and the multitude of fur|rows
lays the &s;urface perfectly dry, giving an ear|ly
opportunity for the barley-&s;eed.&mdash;But I have
more to &s;ay in favour of the method propo&s;ed.
When it is proper to &s;ow the &s;eed, all is laid flat
with the brake, which is an ea&s;y operation upon
&s;oil that is dry and pulverized; and the &s;eed-fur|row
which &s;ucceeds, is &s;o &s;hallow as to bury little
or none of the &s;urface-earth: whereas the &s;tir|ring
for barley is commonly done with the deep|e&s;t
furrow; and con&s;equently buries all the &s;ur|face-&s;oil
that was mellowed by the fro&s;t and air.
Nor is this method more expen&s;ive; becau&s;e the
common ribbing mu&s;t always be followed with a
&s;tirring furrow, which is &s;aved in the method re|commended.
Nay, it is le&s;s expen&s;ive; for after
common ribbing, which keeps in the rain-water,
the ground is commonly &s;o $oured, as to make
the &s;tirring a laborious work.</P>
<P>Where the land is in good order, and free of
weeds, April is the month for &s;owing barley. E|very
day is proper from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The dre&s;&s;ing loamy &s;oil and light &s;oil for bar|ley,
is the &s;ame with that de&s;cribed; only that to
plough dry is not altogether &s;o e&s;&s;ential as in dre&s;|&s;ing
clay &s;oil. Loam or &s;and may be &s;tirred a
little moi&s;t: better, however, delay a week or
<PB N="95" REF="121">
two, than to &s;tir a loam when moi&s;t. Clay mu&s;t
never be ploughed moi&s;t, even though the &s;ca|&s;on
&s;hould e&s;cape altogether. But this will &s;eldom
be nece&s;&s;ary; for not in one year of twenty will
it happen, but that clay is dry enough for plough|ing
&s;ome time in May. Fro&s;t may correct clay
ploughed wet after harve&s;t; but ploughed wet in
the &s;pring, it unites into a hard ma&s;s, not to be
di&s;&s;olved but by very hard labour.</P>
<P>The foregoing culmiferous plants are what are
ordinarily propagated for food in Scotland. What
follow are leguminous plants. And I begin with
beans, being &s;own the earlie&s;t in &s;pring.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>4. BEANS.</HEAD>
<P>THE propere&s;t &s;oil for beans is a deep and moi&s;t
clay.</P>
<P>There was lately introduced into Scotland a me|thod
of &s;owing beans with a drill-plough, and
hor&s;e-hocing the intervals; which, be&s;ide afford|ing
a good crop, is a dre&s;&s;ing to the ground. But
as that method is far from being general, I keep
in the common track.</P>
<P>As this grain is early &s;own, the ground intend|ed
for it &s;hould be ploughed before winter, to give
acce&s;s to the fro&s;t and air; beneficial in all &s;oils,
and nece&s;&s;ary in a clay &s;oil. Take the fir&s;t oppor|tunity
after January when the ground is dry, to
loo&s;en the &s;oil with the harrow fir&s;t de&s;cribed, till
a mould be brought upon it. Sow the &s;eed,
<PB N="96" REF="122">
and cover it with the &s;econd harrow. The third
will &s;mooth the &s;urface, and cover the &s;eed
equally. The&s;e harrows make the very be&s;t
figure in &s;owing beans; which ought to be laid
deep in the ground, not le&s;s than &s;ix inches.
In clay &s;oil, the common harrows are altogether
in&s;ufficient. The &s;oil, which has re&s;ted long after
ploughing, is rendered compact and &s;olid: the
common harrows &s;kim the &s;urface: the &s;eed is not
covered; and the fir&s;t hearty &s;hower of rain lays
it above ground. Where the farmer overtakes
not the ploughing after harve&s;t, and is reduced to
plough immediately before &s;owing, the plough
an&s;wers the purpo&s;e of the fir&s;t harrow; and the
other two will complete the work. But the la|bour
of the fir&s;t harrow is ill &s;aved; as the plough|ing
before winter is a fine preparation, not only
for beans, but for grain of every kind. If the
ground ploughed before winter happen by &s;uper|fluity
of moi&s;ture to cake, the fir&s;t harrow going
along the ridges, and cro&s;&s;ing them, will loo&s;en the
&s;urface, and give acce&s;s to the air for drying. As
&s;oon as the ground is dry, &s;ow without delaying a
moment. If rain happen in the interim, there is
no remedy but patience till a dry day or two
come.</P>
<P>Car&s;e clay, ploughed before winter, &s;eldom fails
to cake. Upon that account, a &s;econd ploughing
is nece&s;&s;ary before &s;owing; which ought to be per|formed
with an ebb furrow, in order to keep the
fro&s;t-mould as near the &s;urface as po&s;&s;ible. To
<PB N="97" REF="123">
cover the &s;eed with the plough is expre&s;&s;ed by the
phra&s;e <HI>to &s;ow under furrow.</HI> The clods rai&s;ed in
this ploughing, are a &s;ort of &s;helter to the young
plants in the chilly &s;pring-months.</P>
<P>The foregoing method will an&s;wer for loam.
And as for a &s;andy or gravelly &s;oil, it is altoge|ther
improper for beans.</P>
<P>Though I cannot recommend the hor&s;e-hoing
of beans, with the intervals that are commonly
allotted for turnip, yet I warmly recommend the
drilling them at the di&s;tance of ten or twelve
inches, and keeping the intervals clean of weeds.
This may be done by hand-hoeing, taking oppor|tunity
at the &s;ame time to lay fre&s;h &s;oil to the roots
of the plants. But as this is an expen&s;ive opera|tion,
and hands are not always to be got, I propo&s;e
a narrow plough, drawn by a &s;ingle hor&s;e, with a
mouldboard on each &s;ide to &s;catter the earth upon
the roots of the plants. This is a cheap and ex|peditious
method: it keeps the ground clean;
and nouri&s;hes the plants with fre&s;h &s;oil.</P>
<P>As beans delight in a mo&s;t &s;oil, and have no
end of growing in a moi&s;t &s;ea&s;on, they cover the
ground totally when &s;own broadca&s;t, keep in the
dew, and exclude the &s;un and air: the plants
grow to a great height, but carry little &s;eed, and
that little not well ripened. This di&s;plays the ad|vantage
of drilling, which gives free acce&s;s to
the &s;un and air, dries the ground, and affords
plenty of ripe &s;eed.</P>

<HEAD>5. PEASE.</HEAD>
<P>PEASE are of two kinds; the white, and the
gray. The latter is what generally is cultivated
in Scotland for fruit; and the latter only &s;hall be
here handled, leaving the former to gardeners.</P>
<P>There are two &s;pecies of the gray kind, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by their time of ripening. One ripens
&s;oon, and for that rea&s;on is termed <HI>hot &s;eed:</HI> the
other, which is &s;lower in ripening, is termed <HI>cold
&s;eed.</HI> Whether the&s;e be really different &s;pecies,
or be accidentally different only, is left to natural
philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>Pea&s;e, a leguminous crop, is proper to inter|vene
between two culmiferous crops; le&s;s for the
profit of a pea&s;e-crop, than for meliorating the
ground. Pea&s;e however in a dry &s;ea&s;on will pro|duce
&s;ix or &s;even bolls each acre; but in an ordi|nary
&s;ea&s;on they &s;eldom reach above two or two
and a half. This leads me to think, that in a
moi&s;t climate, which all the we&s;t of Britain is, red
clover is a more beneficial crop than pea&s;e; as it
makes as good winter-food as pea&s;e, and can be
cut green thrice during &s;ummer. When hu&s;|bandry
comes to be better under&s;tood, I have
little doubt but that red clover will bani&s;h pea&s;e
altogether, except in the warme&s;t and drie&s;t &s;pots.</P>
<P>A field intended &s;or cold &s;eed ought to be
ploughed in October or November; and in Fe|bruary,

in light &s;oil, and four inches in clay &s;oil; for
which rea&s;on, they ought to be &s;own under furrow
when the ploughing is delayed till &s;pring. Of all
grain, beans excepted, they are the lea&s;t in dan|ger
of being buried.</P>
<P>Pea&s;e differ from beans, in loving a dry &s;oil
and a dry &s;ea&s;on. Hor&s;e-hoeing would be a
great benefit, could it be performed to any ad|vantage;
but pea&s;e grow expeditiou&s;ly, and &s;oon
fall over and cover the ground, which bars
ploughing. Hor&s;e-hoeing has little effect when
the plants are new &s;prung; and when they are
advanced to be benefited by that culture, their
length prevents it. Fa&s;t growing at the &s;ame
time is the cau&s;e of their carrying &s;o little &s;eed:
the &s;eed is buried among the leaves; and the &s;un
cannot penetrate to make it grow and ripen. The
only practicable remedy to obtain grain, is thin
&s;owing; but thick &s;owing produces more &s;traw,
and mellows the ground more. Half a boll for an
Engli&s;h acre may be reckoned thin &s;owing; three
firlots, thick &s;owing.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding what is &s;aid above, Mr Hun|ter,
<PB N="100" REF="126">
a noted farmer in Berwick&s;hire, has begun
of late to &s;ow all his pea&s;e in drills; and he never
fails to have great crops of corn as well as of
&s;traw. He &s;ows double rows at a foot interval,
and two feet and a half between the double rows,
which admit hor&s;e-hoeing. By that method, he
has al&s;o good crops of beans on light land.</P>
<P>Pea&s;e and beans mixed are often &s;own toge|ther,
in order to catch different &s;ea&s;ons. In a
moi&s;t &s;ea&s;on, the beans make a good crop; in a
dry &s;ea&s;on, the pea&s;e.</P>
<P>The growth of plants is commonly checked by
drought in the month of July; but promoted by
rain in Augu&s;t. In July, gra&s;s is parched; in Au|gu&s;t,
it recovers verdure. Where pea&s;e are &s;o far
advanced in the dry &s;ea&s;on as that the &s;eed be|gins
to form, their growth is indeed checked,
but the &s;eed continues to fill. If only in the
blo&s;&s;om at that &s;ea&s;on, their growth is checked a
little; but they become vigorous again in Augu&s;t,
and continue growing without filling till &s;topped
by fro&s;t. Hence it is, that cold &s;eed, which is
early &s;own, has the be&s;t chance to produce corn:
hot &s;eed, which is late &s;own, has the be&s;t chance
to produce &s;traw.</P>
<P>The following method is practi&s;ed in Norfolk,
for &s;owing pea&s;e upon a dry light &s;oil, immediately
opened from pa&s;ture. The ground is pared with
a plough extremely thin, and every &s;od is laid ex|actly
on its back. In every &s;od a double row of
holes is made. A pea dropt in every hole lodges
<PB N="101" REF="127">
in the flay'd ground immediately below the &s;od,
thru&s;ts its roots horizontally, and has &s;ufficient
moi&s;ture. This method enabled Norfolk farmers,
in the baren year 1740, to furni&s;h white pea&s;e to
us at 12 s. per boll.</P>

<P>PLANTS of that kind commonly cultivated in
the field, are turnip, potatoes, carrot,
par&s;nip.</P>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>1. TURNIP.</HEAD>
<P>IT animates me to have opportunity for gi|ving
directions about a crop, that the be&s;t farmers
in this country have now taken into their plan of
hu&s;bandry; and that does not altogether e&s;cape
even &s;mall farmers. Nor am I acquainted with
a &s;ingle in&s;tance in Scotland, where turnip fairly
begun have been relinqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>The proper &s;oil for turnip is a gravelly &s;oil; and
there it can be rai&s;ed to the greate&s;t perfection,
and with the lea&s;t hazard of mi&s;carrying. At the
&s;ame time, there is no &s;oil but will bear turnip
when well prepared.</P>
<P>No per&s;on ever de&s;erved better of a country,
than he who fir&s;t cultivated turnip in the field.
<PB N="102" REF="128">
No plant is better fitted for the climate of Britain,
no plant pro&s;pers better in the colde&s;t part of it,
and no plant contributes more to fertility. In a
word, there has not for two centuries been intro|duced
into Britain a more valuable improvement.</P>
<P>Of all roots, turnip requires the fine&s;t mould;
and to that end, of all harrows fro&s;t is the be&s;t. In
order to give acce&s;s to fro&s;t, the land ought to be
prepared by ribbing after harve&s;t, as above di|rected
in preparing land for barley. If the field
be not &s;ubject to annuals, it may lie in that &s;tate
till the end of May; otherwi&s;e the weeds mu&s;t be
de&s;troyed by a brakeing about the middle of A|pril;
and again in May, if weeds ri&s;e. The fir&s;t
week of June, plough the field with a &s;hallow
furrow. Lime it if requi&s;ite, and harrow the lime
into the &s;oil. Draw &s;ingle furrows with intervals
of three feet, and lay dung in the furrows. Co|ver
the dung &s;ufficiently, by going round it with
the plough, and forming the three feet &s;paces in|to
ridges. The dung comes thus to lie below the
crown of every ridge.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on of &s;owing mu&s;t be regulated by the
time intended for feeding. Where intended for
feeding in November, December, January, and
February, the &s;eed ought to be &s;own from the 1&s;t
to the 20th of June. Where the feeding is in|tended
to be carried on to March, April, and
May, the &s;eed mu&s;t not be &s;own till the end of
July. Turnip &s;own earlier than above directed,
<PB N="103" REF="129">
flowers that very &s;ummer, and runs fa&s;t to &s;eed;
which renders it in a good mea&s;ure unfit for food.
If &s;own much later, it does not apple, and there
is no food but from the leaves.</P>
<P>Though by a drill-plough the &s;eed may be &s;own
of any thickne&s;s, the &s;afe&s;t way is to &s;ow thick.
Thin-&s;owing is liable to many accidents, which
are far from being counterbalanced by the ex|pence
that is &s;aved in thinning. Thick-&s;owing
can bear the ravage of the black fly, and leave a
&s;ufficient crop behind. It is a protection again&s;t
drought, gives the plants a rapid progre&s;s, and
e&s;tabli&s;hes them in the ground before it is nece&s;|&s;ary
to thin them.</P>
<P>The &s;owing turnip broadca&s;t is univer&s;al in
England, and common in Scotland, though a
barbarous practice. The eminent advantage of
turnip is, that, be&s;ide a profitable crop, it makes
a mo&s;t complete fallow; and the latter cannot be
obtained but by hor&s;e-hoeing. Upon that ac|count,
I recommend with confidence the &s;owing
turnip in rows at three feet di&s;tance: wider rows
an&s;wer no profitable end, &s;traiter rows afford not
room for a hor&s;e to walk in. When the turnip
is about four inches high, annual weeds will ap|pear.
Go round every interval with the &s;lighte&s;t
furrow po&s;&s;ible, at the di&s;tance of two inches
from each row, moving the earth from the
rows toward the middle of the interval. A thin
plate of iron mu&s;t be fixed on the left &s;ide of the
<PB N="104" REF="130">
plough, to prevent the earth from falling back,
and burying the turnip. Next, let women be em|ployed
to weed the rows with their fingers; which
is better, and cheaper done, than with the hand-hoe.
The hand-hoe, be&s;ide, is apt to di&s;turb the
roots of the turnip that are to &s;tand, and to leave
them open to drought by removing the earth from
them. The &s;tanding turnip are to be at the di|&s;tance
of twelve inches from each other: a great|er
di&s;tance makes them &s;well too much; a le&s;s di|&s;tance
affords them not &s;ufficient room. A wo|man
&s;oon comes to be expert in finger-weeding.
The following hint may be nece&s;&s;ary to a learner.
To &s;ecure the turnip that is to &s;tand, let her cover
it with the left hand; and with the right pull up
the turnip on both &s;ides. After thus freeing the
&s;tanding turnip, &s;he may &s;afely u&s;e both hands.
Let the field remain in this &s;tate, till the appear|ance
of new annuals make a &s;econd ploughing
nece&s;&s;ary; which mu&s;t be in the &s;ame furrow with
the former, but a little deeper. As in this plough|ing
the iron plate is to be removed, part of the
loo&s;e earth will fall back on the roots of the plants:
the re&s;t will fill the middle of the interval, and
bury every weed. When weeds begin again to
appear, then is the time for a third ploughing in
an oppo&s;ite direction, which lays the earth to the
roots of the plants. This ploughing may be a|bout
the middle of Augu&s;t, after which, weeds
ri&s;e very faintly. If they do ri&s;e, another plough|ing
<PB N="105" REF="131">
will clear the ground of them. Weeds that
at this time ri&s;e in the row, may be cleared with
a hand-hoe, which can do little mi&s;chief among
plants di&s;tant twelve inches from each other. I
am certain however from experience, that it may
be done cheaper with the hand<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Children under thirteen may be employed to weed turnip with the fingers. I have &s;een them go on in that work with alacrity; and a &s;mall premium will have a good effect. Cu&s;tom, a &s;econd nature, will lead them to think, that weeding turnip is no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than &s;ow|ing them. For boys and girls above thirteen, a hand-hoe adapted to their &s;ize is an excellent in&s;trument: i$ &s;trengthens the arms amazingly. In driving the plough, the legs only are exerci&s;ed; but as the arms are chiefly employed in hu&s;bandry, they ought to be prepared be|forehand by gentle exerci&s;e.</NOTE>. And after the
leaves of turnips in a row meet together, the
hand is the only in&s;trument that can be applied
for weeding.</P>
<P>Tull was the father of hor&s;e-hoeing hu&s;bandry;
and to de&s;ert his method requires an apology.
The apology I make is, that the method I pre|&s;cribe
and have long practi&s;ed, is more &s;imple,
le&s;s opero&s;e, and, as far as I can judge, equally
&s;ucce&s;sful. Our farmers ought to be excited by
every art to embrace the cultivation of turnip:
and nothing will contribute more than to render
it ea&s;y and &s;imple. Tull's method is not a little
intricate; and to its intricacy, I am per&s;uaded, is
owing the neglect of it in England.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="132">
In &s;wampy ground, the &s;urface of which is be&s;t
reduced by paring and burning, the &s;eed may
be &s;own in rows with intervals of a foot. To &s;ave
time, a drill-plough may be u&s;ed that &s;ows three
or four rows at once. Hand-hoeing is proper for
&s;uch ground; becau&s;e the &s;oil under the burnt
<HI>&s;tratum</HI> is commonly full of roots, which dige&s;t
and rot better under ground than when brought
to the &s;urface by the plough. In the mean time,
while the&s;e are dige&s;ting, the a&s;hes will &s;ecure a
good crop.</P>
<P>The black fly is a great enemy to turnip; and I
may ju&s;tly &s;ay the only enemy, becau&s;e every o|ther
article can be &s;ecured, by &s;kill and diligence
in the hu&s;bandman. In a rich and warm &s;oil,
where the black fly is in&s;tinctively directed to de|po&s;it
its eggs, I take it to be an unconquerable
enemy. Our only &s;ecurity is, to change the field
of battle, by rai&s;ing turnip in a moori&s;h ground,
or in ground newly broken up, according to the
directions given above<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Chap. 3. &sect; 2.</NOTE>.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>2. POTATOES.</HEAD>
<P>THE choice of &s;oil is not of greater importance
in any other plant than in a potato. This plant
in clay &s;oil, or in rank black loam lying low with|out
ventilation, never makes palatable food. In
<PB N="107" REF="133">
a gravelly or &s;andy &s;oil, expo&s;ed to the &s;un and
to free air, it thrives to perfection, and has a good
reli&s;h. But a rank black loam, though improper
to rai&s;e potatoes for the table, produces them in
great plenty; and the product is good and whole|&s;ome
food for horned cattle, hogs, and poultry.</P>
<P>The &s;pade is a proper in&s;trument for rai&s;ing a
&s;mall quantity, or for preparing corners or other
places inacce&s;&s;ible to the plough; but for rai&s;ing
potatoes in quantities, the plough is the only in|&s;trument.</P>
<P>As two great advantages of a drilled crop, are, to
de&s;troy weeds, and to have a fallow at the &s;ame
time with the crop, no judicious farmer will think
of rai&s;ing potatoes in any other way. In Septem|ber
or October, as &s;oon as that year's crop is remo|ved,
let the field have a rou&s;ing furrow, a cro&s;s|brakeing
next, and then cleared of weeds by the
cleaning harrow. Form it into three-feet ridges, in
that &s;tate to lie till April, which is the proper time
for planting potatoes. Cro&s;s-brake it to rai&s;e the
furrows a little. Then lay well-dige&s;ted hor&s;e-dung
along the furrows, upon which lay the roots at
eight inches di&s;tance. Cover up the&s;e roots with
the plough, going once round every row. This
makes a warm bed for the potatoes; hot dung
below, and a loo&s;e covering above, that admits e|very
ray of the &s;un. As &s;oon as the plants ap|pear
above ground, go round every row a &s;econd
time with the plough, which will lay upon the
<PB N="108" REF="134">
plants an additional inch or two of mould, and at
the &s;ame time bury all the annuals; and this will
complete the ploughing of the ridges. When
the potatoes are &s;ix inches high, the plough, with
the deepe&s;t furrow, mu&s;t go twice along the
middle of each interval in oppo&s;ite directions, lay|ing
earth fir&s;t to one row, and next to the other.
And to perform this work, a plough with a
double mould-board will be more expeditious.
But as the earth cannot be laid clo&s;e to the roots
by the plough, the &s;pade mu&s;t &s;ucceed, with
which four inches of the plants mu&s;t be covered,
leaving little more but the tops above ground;
and this operation will at the &s;ame time bury all
the weeds that have &s;prung &s;ince the former
ploughing. What weeds ari&s;e after, mu&s;t be pull|ed
up with the hand. A hoe is never to be u&s;ed
here: it cannot go &s;o deep as to de&s;troy the weeds
without cutting the fibres of the plants; and if it
&s;kim the &s;urface, it only cuts off the heads of the
weeds, and does not prevent their pu&s;hing again.</P>
<P>The &s;horte&s;t and mo&s;t perfect method of ta|king
up potatoes, is to plough once round every
row at the di&s;tance of four inches, removing the
earth from the plants, and gathering up with the
hand all the potatoes that appear. The di&s;tance
is made four inches to prevent cutting the roots,
which are &s;eldom found above that di&s;tance from
the row on each &s;ide. When the ground is thus
cleared by the plough, rai&s;e the potatoes with a
<PB N="109" REF="135">
fork having three broad toes or claws, which is
better than a &s;pade, as it does not cut the pota|toes.
The potatoes thus laid above ground, mu&s;t
be gathered with the hand. By this method
&s;carce a potato will be left.</P>
<P>As potatoes are a comfortable food for the low
people, it is of importance to have them all the
year round. For a long time, potatoes in Scot|land
were confined to the kitchen-garden; and
after they were planted in the field, it was not
imagined at fir&s;t that they could be u&s;ed after the
month of December. Of late years they have
been found to an&s;wer even till April; which has
proved a great &s;upport to many a poor family, as
they are ea&s;ily cooked, and require neither kiln
nor mill. But there is no cau&s;e for &s;topping
there. It is ea&s;y to pre&s;erve them till the next
crop: When taken out of the ground, lay in the
corner of a barn a quantity that may &s;erve till
April, covered from fro&s;t with dry &s;traw pre&s;&s;ed
down: bury the remainder in a hole dug in dry
ground, mixed with the hu&s;ks of dried oats,
&s;and, or the dry leaves of trees, over which build
a &s;tack of hay or corn. When the pit is opened
for taking out the potatoes, the eyes of what
have a tendency to pu&s;h, mu&s;t be cut out; and
this cargo will &s;erve all the month of June. To
be &s;till more certain of making the old crop meet
the new, the &s;etting of a &s;mall quantity may
be delayed till June, to be taken up at the ordi|nary
<PB N="110" REF="136">
time before fro&s;t. This cargo, having not
arrived to full growth, will not be &s;o ready to
pu&s;h as what are &s;et in April.</P>
<P>If the crop happen to be exhau&s;ted before the
new crop is ready, the interval may be &s;upplied
by the potatoes of the new crop that lie next the
&s;urface, to be picked up with the hand; which,
far from hurting the crop, will rather improve it.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>3. CARROT and PARSNIP.</HEAD>
<P>OF all roots a carrot requires the deepe&s;t &s;oil.
It ought at lea&s;t to be a foot deep, all equally good
from top to bottom. If &s;uch a &s;oil be not in the
farm, it may be made artificially by trench|ploughing,
which brings to the &s;urface what ne|ver
had any communication with the &s;un or air.
When this new &s;oil is &s;ufficiently improved by a
crop or two with dung, it is fit for bearing car|rots.
Beware of dunging the year when the car|rots
are &s;own; for with fre&s;h dung they &s;eldom
e&s;cape rotten &s;cabs.</P>
<P>The only &s;oils proper for that root, are a loam
and a &s;andy &s;oil.</P>
<P>The ground mu&s;t be prepared by the deepe&s;t
furrow that can be taken, the &s;ooner after harve&s;t
the better; immediately upon the back of which
a ribbing ought to &s;ucceed as directed for barley.
At the end of March or beginning of April,
which is the time of &s;owing the &s;eed, the ground
<PB N="111" REF="137">
mu&s;t be &s;moothed with a brake. Sow the &s;eed in
drills, with intervals of a foot for hand-hoeing;
which is no expen&s;ive operation where the crop is
confined to an acre or two: but if the quantity
of ground be greater, the intervals ought to be
three feet, in order for hor&s;e-hoeing.</P>
<P>In flat ground without ridges, it may be pro|per
to make parallel furrows with the plough, ten
feet from each other, in order to carry off any
redundant moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>At Parlington in York&s;hire, from the end of
September to the fir&s;t of May, twenty work-hor&s;es,
four bullocks, and &s;ix milk-cows, were
fed on the carrots that grew on three acres; and
the&s;e animals never ta&s;ted any other food but a
little hay. The milk was excellent: and, over
and above, thirty hogs were fattened upon what
was left by the other bea&s;ts. I have this fact
from undoubted authority.</P>
<P>The culture of par&s;nips is the &s;ame with that
of carrots.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">PLANTS CULTIVATED FOR LEAVES.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are many garden-plants of this kind,
The plants proper for the field are cab|bage,
red and white, colewort, plain and curled.
I know very little difference in the cultivation of
<PB N="112" REF="138">
the&s;e plants. And therefore, to &s;ave trouble, I
&s;hall confine my&s;elf to cabbage. The reader will
ea&s;ily apply to the other plants the directions to be
given concerning cabbage.</P>
<P>Cabbage is an intere&s;ting article in hu&s;bandry,
every &s;oil being more or le&s;s proper for it. It is
ea&s;ily rai&s;ed, is &s;ubject to few di&s;ea&s;es, re&s;i&s;ts fro&s;t
more than turnip, is palatable to cattle, and &s;oon|$$
$word$ them than turnip, carrot, or potatoes.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on for &s;etting cabbage, depends on the
u&s;e it is intended for. If intended for feeding in
November, December, and January, plants pro|cured
from &s;eed &s;own the end of July the preceding
year, mu&s;t be &s;et in March or April. If intended
for feeding in March, April, and May, the plants
mu&s;t be &s;et the fir&s;t week of the preceding July,
from &s;eed &s;own end of February or beginning
of March the &s;ame year. The late &s;etting of the
plants retards their growth; by which means they
have a vigorous growth the following &s;pring.
And this crop makes an important link in the
chain that connects winter and &s;ummer green
food. Let me ob&s;erve by the by, that where
cabbage for &s;pring-food happens to be neglected,
a few acres of rye &s;own at Michaelmas will &s;upply
the want. After the rye is con&s;umed, there is
time &s;ufficient to prepare the ground for turnip.</P>
<P>And now to prepare a field for cabbage.
Where the plants are to be &s;et in March, the field
mu&s;t be made up after harve&s;t, in ridges three
<PB N="113" REF="139">
feet wide. In that form let it lie all winter, to be
mellowed with air and fro&s;t. In March, take the
fir&s;t opportunity, between wet and dry, to lay
dung in the furrows. Cover the dung with a
plough, which will convert the furrow into a
crown, and con&s;equently the crown into a furrow.
Set the plants upon the dung, di&s;tant from each
other three feet. Plant them &s;o as to make a
&s;traight line cro&s;s the ridges, as well as along the
furrows, to which a gardener's line &s;tretched per|pendicularly
cro&s;s the furrows will be requi&s;ite.
This will &s;et each plant at the di&s;tance preci&s;ely of
three feet from the plants that furround it. The
purpo&s;e of this accuracy, is to give opportunity
for ploughing, not only along the ridges, but cro&s;s
them. This mode is attended with three &s;ignal
advantages: it &s;aves hand-hoeing, it is a more
complete dre&s;&s;ing to the &s;oil, and it lays earth neat|ly
round every plant.</P>
<P>If the &s;oil be deep and compo&s;ed of good earth,
a trench-ploughing after the preceding crop will
not be ami&s;s; in which ca&s;e, the time for divi|ding
the field into three-feet ridges as above,
ought to be immediately before the dunging for
the plants.</P>
<P>If weeds happen to ri&s;e &s;o clo&s;e to the plants
as not to be reached by the plough, it will require
very little labour to de&s;troy them with a hand-hoe.</P>
<P>Unle&s;s the &s;oil be much infe&s;ted with annuals,
twice ploughing after the plants are &s;et will be a
<PB N="114" REF="140">
&s;ufficient dre&s;&s;ing. The fir&s;t removes the earth
from the plants; the next, at the di&s;tance of a
month or &s;o, lays it back.</P>
<P>Where the plants are to be &s;et in July, the field
mu&s;t be ribbed as directed for barley. It ought
to have a &s;light ploughing in June before the
planting, in order to loo&s;en the &s;oil, but not &s;o as
to bury the &s;urface-earth; after which the three|feet
ridges mu&s;t be formed, and the other parti|culars
carried on as directed above with re&s;pect to
plants that are to be &s;et in March.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">CULTURE OF GRASS.</HEAD>
<P>THE gra&s;&s;es commonly &s;own for pa&s;ture, for
hay, or to cut green for cattle, are red
clover, white clover, yellow clover, ryegra&s;s, and
narrow-leaved plantain, commonly called <HI>ribwort.</HI>
Among the great variety of gra&s;&s;es, there is little
doubt, but that &s;ome new &s;orts may be introdu|ced
to advantage. But without meaning to &s;hut
out light, I am certain that the gra&s;&s;es mentioned
an&s;wer completely all u&s;eful purpo&s;es of hu&s;|bandry.</P>
<P>Red clover is of all the mo&s;t proper to be cut
green for &s;ummer-food. It is a biennial plant
when &s;uffered to perfect its &s;eed; but when cut
<PB N="115" REF="141">
green, it will la&s;t three years, and in a dry &s;oil
longer. At the &s;ame time the &s;afe&s;t cour&s;e is to
let it &s;tand but a &s;ingle year: if the &s;econd year's
crop happen to be &s;canty, it proves, like a bad
crop of pea&s;e, a great encourager of weeds by the
&s;helter it affords them. Sainfoin and lucern make
excellent green food; and, when pre&s;erved clean
from weeds, they will &s;tand good ten or twelve
years, e&s;pecially in a deep gravel. There they
extend their roots very deep, and will grow vigo|rou&s;ly
in a dry &s;ummer, when other plants of
&s;horter roots langui&s;h by lack of moi&s;ture. But
except in &s;uch a &s;oil, I venture to declare in fa|vour
of red clover; and my rea&s;on is, that the
expence of &s;owing it yearly is much le&s;s than that
of hand-hoeing &s;ainfoin and lucern frequently e|very
year. Sainfoin indeed &s;eems to be the har|dier
plant. Farmers about Bath &s;ow it in their
highe&s;t un&s;heltered grounds; and it endures fro&s;t
better than clover, or any &s;ort of grain. Like
clover it is &s;own with barley; and as much &s;eed
is given as of barley. It is commonly cut but
once the fir&s;t year; and the fir&s;t winter, coal|a&s;hes
are &s;pread upon it.</P>
<P>Here, as in all other crops, the goodne&s;s of
red-clover &s;eed is of importance. Chu&s;e plump
&s;eed of a purple colour, becau&s;e it takes on that
colour when ripe. It is red when hurt in the
drying, and of a faint colour when unripe.</P>
<P>Red clover is luxuriant upon a rich &s;oil, whe|ther
<PB N="116" REF="142">
clay, loam, or gravel: it will grow even up|on
a moor when properly cultivated. A wet &s;oil
is its only bane; for there it does not thrive.</P>
<P>To have red clover in perfection, weeds mu&s;t
be extirpated, and &s;tones taken off. The mould
ought to be made as fine as harrowing can make
it; and the &s;urface be &s;moothed with a light rol|ler,
if not &s;ufficently &s;mooth without it. This
gives opportunity for di&s;tributing the &s;eed evenly;
which mu&s;t be covered by a &s;mall harrow with
teeth no larger than of a garden-rake, three inches
long, and &s;ix inches a&s;under; of which there is
a draught annexed. In harrowing, the man
&s;hould walk behind with a rope in his hand fixed
to the back part of the harrow, ready to di&s;en|tangle
it from &s;tones, clods, turnip or cabbage
roots, which would trail the feed, and di&s;place it.</P>
<P>Nature has not determined any preci&s;e depth
for the &s;eed of red clover more than of other &s;eed.
It will grow vigorou&s;ly from two inches deep,
and it will grow when barely covered. Half an inch
I reckon the mo&s;t advantageous po&s;ition in clay
&s;oil, a whole inch in what is light or loo&s;e. It is
a vulgar error, that &s;mall &s;eed ought to be &s;pa|ringly
covered. Mi&s;&s;ed by that error, farmers
commonly cover their clover-&s;eed with a bu&s;hy
branch of thorn; which not only covers it une|qually,
but leaves part on the &s;urface to wither in
the air.</P>
<P>The proper &s;ea&s;on for &s;owing red clover, is from
<PB N="117" REF="143">
the middle of April to the middle of May. It will
&s;pring from the 1&s;t of March to the end of Au|gu&s;t;
but &s;uch liberty ought not to be taken ex|cept
from nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>The ordinary manner of &s;owing, is to hold the
&s;eed between the thumb and the two fore fingers.
I prefer another manner; which is, to take into the
hollow of the hand as much as will &s;erve in walk|ing
three or four &s;teps; and to join the fingers to
the palm &s;o loo&s;ely, as to make many &s;mall holes
for throwing out the &s;eed. A hand clo&s;ed &s;o loo&s;e|ly,
re&s;embles the ro&s;e of a watering pan, which
&s;catters the water through a number of &s;mall
holes.</P>
<P>There cannot be a greater blunder in hu&s;band|ry,
than to be &s;paring of &s;eed. Ideal writers talk
of &s;owing an acre with four pounds. That
quantity of &s;eed, &s;ay they, will fill an acre with
plants as thick as they ought to &s;tand. I admit
this rule to be good where grain is the object;
but it will not an&s;wer with re&s;pect to gra&s;s. Gra&s;s|&s;eed
cannot be &s;own too thick: the plants &s;helter
one another: they retain all the dew: and they
mu&s;t pu&s;h upward, having no room laterally.
Ob&s;erve the place where a &s;ack of pea&s;e, or of o|ther
grain, has been &s;et down for &s;owing: the
&s;eed dropt there accidentally grows more quickly
than in the re&s;t of the field &s;own thin out of hand:
I have &s;een it &s;ix inches high, when the re&s;t of
the &s;eed &s;carce appeared above ground. A young
<PB N="118" REF="144">
plant of clover, or of &s;ainfoin, according to Tull,
may be rai&s;ed to a great &s;ize where it has room;
but the field will not produce half the quantity.
When red clover is &s;own for cutting green, there
ought not to be le&s;s than twenty-four pounds to
an acre. A field of clover is &s;eldom too thick:
the &s;maller a &s;tem be, the more acceptable it is to
cattle. It is often too thin, and when &s;o, the
&s;tems tend to wood.</P>
<P>Red clover is commonly &s;own with grain; and
the doubt may be, what grain is the mo&s;t proper.
I pronounce in favour of flax; and I pronounce
with confidence from multiplied experience. The
&s;oil mu&s;t be highly cultivated for flax as well as
for red clover. The proper &s;ea&s;on of &s;owing is the
&s;ame for both: the leaves of flax being very
&s;mall, admit of free circulation of air; and flax
being an early crop, is removed &s;o early as to give
the clover time for growing. In a rich &s;oil it has
grown &s;o fa&s;t, as to afford a good cutting that
very year. Next to flax, barley is the be&s;t com|panion
to clover. The &s;oil mu&s;t be loo&s;e and free
for barley; and &s;o it ought to be for clover: the
&s;ea&s;on of &s;owing is the &s;ame; and the clover is
well e&s;tabli&s;hed in the ground, before it is over|topped
by the barley. At the &s;ame time, barley
commonly is &s;ooner cut than either oats or wheat.
In a word, barley is rather a nur&s;e than a &s;tepmo|ther
to clover during its infancy. When clover
is &s;own in &s;pring upon wheat, the &s;oil, which has
<PB N="119" REF="145">
lain five or &s;ix months without being &s;tirred, is an
improper bed for it; and the wheat, being in the
vigour of growth, overtops it from the begin|ning.
It cannot be &s;own along with oats, becau&s;e
of the hazard of fro&s;t; and when &s;own as u&s;ual
among oats three inches high, it is overtopped,
and never enjoys free air till the oats be cut.
Add, that where oats are &s;own upon the winter-furrow,
the &s;oil is rendered as hard as when under
wheat. Red clover is &s;ometimes &s;own by it&s;elf,
without other grain; but this method, be&s;ide lo|&s;ing
a crop, is not &s;alutary; becau&s;e clover in its
infant &s;tate requires &s;helter. This very year 1775
has confirmed all my experiments about clover.
In part of a field, flax was &s;own with it; in an|other
part, barley; and, in the remainder, it was
&s;own alone. The clover on the fir&s;t was the be&s;t;
on the &s;econd, inferior; and, on the third, the
wor&s;t. Yet the barley was &s;own thin, as it ought
to be with gra&s;s-&s;eeds, and was but an indifferent
crop.</P>
<P>And this leads to the quantity of grain proper
to be &s;own with clover. In a rich &s;oil well pul|verized,
a peck of barley on an Engli&s;h acre is all
that ought to be ventured; but there is not much
&s;oil in Scotland &s;o rich. Two Linlithgow &s;irlots
make the proper quantity for an acre that produces
commonly &s;ix bolls of barley; half a firlot for what
produces nine bolls. To tho&s;e who are govern|ed
by cu&s;tom, &s;o &s;mall a quantity will be thought
<PB N="120" REF="146">
ridiculous. Let them only con&s;ider, that a rich
&s;oil in perfect good order, will from a &s;ingle &s;eed
of barley produce twenty or thirty vigorous &s;tems.
People may flatter them&s;elves with the remedy, of
cutting barley green for food, if it happen to op|pre&s;s
the clover. This is an excellent remedy in
a field of an acre or two; but the cutting an ex|ten&s;ive
field for food mu&s;t be flow; and while one
part is cutting, the clover is &s;mothered in other
parts.</P>
<P>The culture of white clover, of yellow clover,
of ribwort, of ryegra&s;s, is the &s;ame in general
with that of red clover. I proceed to their pecu|liarities.
Yellow clover, ribwort, ryegra&s;s, are
all of them early plants, blooming the end of A|pril
or beginning of May. The two latter are
evergreens, and therefore excellent for winter-pa&s;ture.
Ryegra&s;s is le&s;s hurt by fro&s;t than any
of the clovers, and will thrive in a moi&s;ter &s;oil:
nor in that &s;oil is it much affected by drought. In
a rich &s;oil, it grows four feet high: even in the
dry &s;ummer 1775, it ro&s;e to three feet eight
inches; but it had gained that height before the
drought came on. The&s;e gra&s;&s;es are generally
&s;own with red clover for producing a plentiful
crop. The proportion of &s;eed is arbitrary; and
there is little danger of too much. When ryegra&s;s
is &s;own for procuring &s;eed, five &s;irlots wheat-mea|&s;ure
may be &s;own on an acre; and for procuring
&s;eed of ribwort, forty pounds may be &s;own. The
<PB N="121" REF="147">
roots of ryegra&s;s &s;pread horizontally: they bind
the &s;oil by their number; and though &s;mall, are
yet &s;o vigorous as to thrive in hard &s;oil. Red
clover has a large tap-root, which cannot pene|trate
any &s;oil but what is open and free; and the
largene&s;s of the root makes the &s;oil &s;till more open
and free. Ryegra&s;s, once a great favourite, ap|pears
to be di&s;carded in mo&s;t parts of Britain.
But were the management of it well under&s;tood,
it would be re&s;tored to high favour. The com|mon
practice has been, to &s;ow it with red clover,
and to cut them promi&s;cuou&s;ly the beginning of
June for green food, and a little later for hay.
This indeed is the proper &s;ea&s;on for cutting red
clover, becau&s;e at that time it begins to flower; but
as at that time the &s;eed of the ryegre&s;s is approach|ing
to maturity, its growth is &s;topped for that
year, as much as of oats or barley cut after the
&s;eed is ripe. Oats or barley cut green before the
&s;eed forms, will afford two other cuttings; which
is the ca&s;e ef ryegra&s;s, of yellow clover, and of
ribwort. By &s;uch management, all the profit will
be drawn that the&s;e plants can afford.</P>
<P>When red clover is intended for &s;eed, the
ground ought to be cleared of weeds, were it for
no other purpo&s;e than that the &s;eed cannot other|wi&s;e
be pre&s;erved pure: what weeds e&s;cape the
plough, ought to be taken out by the hand. In
England, when a crop of &s;eed is intended, the
clover is always fir&s;t cut for hay. This I conjec|ture
<PB N="122" REF="148">
to be done, as in fruit-trees, to check the
growth of the wood, in order to encourage the
fruit. This practice will not an&s;wer with us, as
the &s;eed would often be too late for ripening. It
would do better to eat the clover with &s;heep till
the middle of May, which would allow the &s;eed
to ripen. The &s;eed is ripe when, upon rubbing
it between the hands, it parts readily from the
hu&s;k. Then apply the &s;ythe, &s;pread the crop thin,
and turn it carefully. When perfectly dry, take
the fir&s;t opportunity of a hot day for thre&s;hing it
on boards covered with a coar&s;e &s;heet. Another
way le&s;s &s;ubject to ri&s;k, is to &s;tack the dry hay,
and to thre&s;h it the end of April. After the fir&s;t
thre&s;hing, expo&s;e the hu&s;ks to the &s;un, and thre&s;h
them over and over till no &s;eed remain. Nothing
is more efficacious than a hot &s;un to make the
hu&s;k part with its &s;eed; in which view it may be
expo&s;ed to the &s;un by parcels, an hour or two be|fore
the flail is applied.</P>
<P>White clover intended for &s;eed, is managed in
the &s;ame manner. No plant ought to be mixed
with ryegra&s;s that is intended for &s;eed. In Scot|land,
much ryegra&s;s-&s;eed is hurt by tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing
that rule. The &s;eed is ripe when it parts ea&s;ily
from the hu&s;k. The yellowne&s;s of the &s;tem is an|other
indication of its ripene&s;s; in which particu|lar
it re&s;embles oats, barley, and other culmiferous
plants. The be&s;t manner to manage a crop of
ryegra&s;s for &s;eed, is to bind it loo&s;ely in &s;mall
<PB N="123" REF="149">
&s;heaves, widening them at the bottom to make
them &s;tand erect; as is done with oats in moi&s;t
weather. In that &s;tate they may &s;tand till &s;uf|ficiently
dry for thre&s;hing. By this method they
dry more quickly, and are le&s;s hurt by rain, than
by clo&s;e binding and putting the &s;heaves in &s;hocks
like corn. The wor&s;t way of all, is, to &s;pread
the ryegra&s;s on the moi&s;t ground; for it makes
the &s;eed malten. The &s;heaves, when &s;ufficiently
dry, are carried in clo&s;e carts to where they are
to be thre&s;hed on a board, as mentioned above
for clover. Put the &s;traw in a rick, when a hun|dred
&s;tone or &s;o are thre&s;hed. Carry the thre&s;h|ing-board
to the place where another rick is in|tended;
and &s;o on till the whole &s;eed be thre&s;hed,
and the &s;traw ricked. There is nece&s;&s;ity for clo&s;e
carts to &s;ave the &s;eed, which is apt to drop out in
a hot &s;un: and, as ob&s;erved above, a hot &s;un
ought always to be cho&s;en for thre&s;hing. Carry
the &s;eed in &s;acks to the granary or barn, there
to be &s;eparated from the hu&s;ks by a fanner.
Spread the &s;eed thin upon a timber floor, and
turn it once or twice a day, till perfectly dry. If
&s;uffered to take a heat, it is u&s;ele&s;s for &s;eed.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ROTATION OF CROPS.</HEAD>
<P>NO branch of hu&s;bandry requires more &s;kill
and &s;agacity than a proper rotation of
crops, &s;o as to keep the ground always in heart,
and yet to draw out of it the greate&s;t profit po&s;|&s;ible.
A hor&s;e is purcha&s;ed for labour; and it is
the purcha&s;er's intention to make the mo&s;t of him.
He is well fed, and wrought according to his
&s;trength: to overwork him, is to render him
u&s;ele&s;s. Preci&s;ely &s;imilar is land. Profit is the
farmer's object; but he knows, that to run out
his farm by indi&s;creet cropping, is not the way to
make profit. Some plants rob the &s;oil, others are
gentle to it: &s;ome bind, others loo&s;en. The nice
point is, to intermix crops, &s;o as to make the great|e&s;t
profit con&s;i&s;tently with keeping the ground in
trim. In that view, the nature of the plants em|ployed
in hu&s;bandry, mu&s;t be accurately exami|ned.</P>
<P>The difference between culmiferous and legu|minous
plants, is occa&s;ionally mentioned above<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Chap. 5.</NOTE>.
With re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, a clo&s;er in|&s;pection
is nece&s;&s;ary. Culmiferous plants, having
&s;mall leaves and few in number, depend mo&s;tly
<PB N="125" REF="151">
on the &s;oil for nouri&s;hment, and little on the air.
During the ripening of the &s;eed, they draw pro|bably
their whole nouri&s;hment from the &s;oil; as
the leaves by this time, being dry and withered,
mu&s;t have lo&s;t their power of drawing nouri&s;h|ment
from the air. Now, as culmiferous plants
are chiefly cultivated for their &s;eed, and are not
cut down till the &s;eed be fully ripe, they may be
pronounced all of them to be robbers, &s;ome more
&s;ome le&s;s. But &s;uch plants, while young, are all
leaves; and in that &s;tate draw mo&s;t of their nou|ri&s;hment
from the air. Hence it is, that where
cut green for food to cattle, a culmiferous crop
is far from being a robber. A hay-crop accor|dingly,
even where it con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly of ryegra&s;s,
is not a robber, provided it be cut before the &s;eed
is formed; which at any rate it ought to be, if
one would have hay in perfection. And the fog|gage,
excluding fro&s;t by covering the ground,
keeps the roots warm. A leguminous plant, by
its broad leaves, draws much of its nouri&s;hment
from the air. A cabbage, which has very broad
leaves, and a multitude of them, owes its growth
more to the air than to the &s;oil. One fact is cer|tain,
that a cabbage cut and hung up in a damp
place, pre&s;erves its verdure longer than other
plants. At the &s;ame time, a &s;eed is that part of a
plant which requires the mo&s;t nouri&s;hment; and for
that nouri&s;hment a culmiferous plant mu&s;t be in|debted
entirely to the &s;oil. A leguminous crop,
<PB N="126" REF="152">
on the contrary, when cut green for food, mu&s;t
be very gentle to the ground. Pea&s;e and beans
are leguminous plants; but being cultivated for
&s;eed, they &s;eem to occupy a middle &s;tation: their
&s;eed makes them more &s;evere than other legumi|nous
crops cut green: their leaves, which grow till
reaping, make them le&s;s &s;evere than a culmife|rous
plant left to ripen.</P>
<P>The&s;e plants are di&s;tingui&s;hed no le&s;s remark|ably
by the following circum&s;tance. All the &s;eeds
of a culmiferous plant ripen at the &s;ame time. As
&s;oon as they begin to form, the plant becomes
&s;tationary, the leaves wither, the roots cea&s;e to
pu&s;h, and the plant, when cut down, is blanched
and &s;aple&s;s. The &s;eeds of a leguminous plant
are formed &s;ucce&s;&s;ively: flowers and fruit appear
at the &s;ame time in different parts of the plant.
This plant accordingly is continually growing, and
pu&s;hing its roots. Hence the value of bean or
pea&s;e &s;traw above that of wheat or oats: the lat|ter
is withered and dry when the crop is cut; the
former, green and &s;ucculent. The difference
therefore with re&s;pect to the &s;oil between a cul|miferous
and leguminous crop, is great. The
latter, growing till cut down, keeps the ground
in con&s;tant motion, and leaves it to the plough
loo&s;e and mellow. The former gives over grow|ing
long before reaping, and the ground, by want
of motion, turns compact and hard. Nor is this
all. Dew falling on a culmiferous crop after the
<PB N="127" REF="153">
ground begins to harden, re&s;ts on the &s;urface, and
is &s;ucked up by the next &s;un. Dew that falls on
a leguminous crop, is &s;haded from the &s;un by
the broad leaves, and &s;inks at lei&s;ure into the
ground. The ground accordingly after a culmi|ferous
crop, is not only hard but dry: after a le|guminous
crop, it is not only loo&s;e, but &s;oft and
unctuous.</P>
<P>Of all culmiferous plants, wheat is the mo&s;t &s;e|vere,
by the long time it occupies the ground
without admitting a plough. And as the grain is
heavier than that of barley or oats, it probably
requires more nouri&s;hment than either. Spring-wheat
is creeping into u&s;e: if it &s;ucceed, it will
probably be not much more &s;evere than other cul|miferous
plants. It is ob&s;erved above, that as
pea&s;e and beans draw part of their nouri&s;hment
from the air by their green leaves while allowed
to &s;tand, they draw the le&s;s from the ground;
and by their con&s;tant growing they leave it in good
condition for &s;ub&s;equent crops. In both re&s;pects
they are preferable to any culmiferous crop.</P>
<P>Culmiferous crops, as ob&s;erved above, are not
robbers when cut green: the &s;oil, far from har|dening,
is kept in con&s;tant motion by the pu&s;h|ing
of the roots, and is left more tender than if
it had been left at re&s;t without bearing any crop.</P>
<P>Bulbous-rooted plants are above all &s;ucce&s;sful in
dividing and pulveri&s;ing the &s;oil. Potato-roots grow
&s;ix, eight, or ten, inches under the &s;urface; and, by
<PB N="128" REF="154">
their &s;ize and number, they divide and pulverize
the &s;oil better than can be done by the plough;
con&s;equently, whatever be the natural colour of
the &s;oil, it is black when a potato-crop is taken
up. The potato, however, with re&s;pect to its
quality of dividing the &s;oil, mu&s;t yield to a carrot
or par&s;nip; which are large roots, and pierce oft|en
to the depth of eighteen inches. The turnip,
by its tap-root, divides the &s;oil more than can be
done by a fibrous-rooted plant; but as its bulbous
root grows mo&s;tly above ground, it divides the
&s;oil le&s;s than the potato, the carrot, or the par&s;|nip.
Red clover, in that re&s;pect, may be put in
the &s;ame cla&s;s with turnip.</P>
<P>Whether potatoes or turnip be the more gentle
crop, appears a puzzling que&s;tion. The former
bears &s;eed, and probably draws more nouri&s;h|ment
from the &s;oil than the latter, when cut green.
On the other hand, potatoes divide the &s;oil more
than turnip, and leave it more loo&s;e and friable.
It appears no le&s;s puzzling, to determine between
cabbage and turnip: the former draws more of
its nouri&s;hment from the air, the latter leaves the
&s;oil more free and open.</P>
<P>Here are a number of facts: What is the re|&s;ult
of the whole? Clearly what follows. Culmi|ferous
plants are robbers; &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s:
they at the &s;ame time bind the &s;oil; &s;ome more,
&s;ome le&s;s. Leguminous plants in both re&s;pects
are oppo&s;ite: if any of them rob the &s;oil, it is in
<PB N="129" REF="155">
a very &s;light degree; and all of them without ex|ception
loo&s;en the &s;oil. A culmiferous crop, how|ever,
is generally the more profitable: but few
&s;oils can long bear the burden of &s;uch crops, un|le&s;s
relieved by interjected leguminous crops.
The&s;e, on the other hand, without a mixture of
culmiferous crops, would &s;oon render the &s;oil too
loo&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e preliminaries will carry the farmer &s;ome
length in directing a proper rotation of crops.
Where dung, lime, or other manure, can be pro|cured
in plenty to recruit the &s;oil after &s;evere
cropping, I know no rotation more proper or pro|fitable
in a &s;trong &s;oil, than wheat, pea&s;e or
beans, barley, oats, fallow. The whole farm
may be brought under this rotation, except &s;o
&s;ar as hay is wanted. But as &s;uch command of
manure is rare, it is of more importance to deter|mine
what &s;hould be the rotation, where no ma|nure
can be procured but the dung collected in
the farm. Con&s;idering that culmiferous crops are
the more profitable in rich land, it would be pro|per
to make them more frequent than the other
kind. But as there are few &s;oils in Scotland that
will admit &s;uch frequent culmiferous crops with|out
&s;uffering, it may be laid down as a general
rule, that alternate crops, culmiferous and legu|minous,
ought to form the rotation. Nor are
there many &s;oils that will &s;tand good, even with
this favourable rotation, unle&s;s relieved from time
<PB N="130" REF="156">
to time by pa&s;turing a few years. If &s;uch extended
rotation be artfully carried on, I take it for grant|ed,
that crops without end may be obtained in a
tolerable good &s;oil, without any manure but what
is produced in the farm.</P>
<P>Having di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the nature of plants, as far as
rotation of crops is concerned, the nature of the &s;oil
comes next under con&s;ideration. It is &s;carce ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to be mentioned, being known to every
farmer, that clay an&s;wers be&s;t for wheat, moi&s;t clay
for beans, loam for barley and pea&s;e, light &s;oil for
turnip, &s;andy &s;oil for rye and buck wheat; and
that oats thrive better in coar&s;e &s;oil than any other
grain. Now, in directing a rotation, it is not &s;uf|ficient
that a culmiferous crop be always &s;ucceed|ed
by a leguminous: attention mu&s;t be al&s;o given,
that no crop be introduced that is unfit for the
&s;oil. Wheat, being a great binder, requires more
than any other crop a leguminous crop to follow.
But every &s;uch crop is not proper: po$atoes are the
greate&s;t openers of &s;oil; but they are improper in
a wheat-&s;oil. Neither will turnip an&s;wer, becau&s;e
it requires a light &s;oil. A very loo&s;e &s;oil, after a
crop of rye requires ryegra&s;s to bind it, or the
treading of cattle in pa&s;turing: but to bind the
&s;oil wheat mu&s;t not be ventured; for it &s;ucceeds
ill in loo&s;e &s;oil.</P>
<P>Another con&s;ideration of moment in directing
the rotation, is to avoid crops that encourage
weeds. Pea&s;e is the fitte&s;t of all crops for &s;uc|ceeding
<PB N="131" REF="157">
to wheat, becau&s;e it renders the ground
loo&s;e and mellow, and the &s;ame &s;oil agrees with
both. But beware of pea&s;e, unle&s;s the &s;oil be
left by the wheat perfectly free of weeds; becau&s;e
pea&s;e, if not an extraordinary crop, &s;o&s;ter weeds.
Barley may be ventured after wheat, if the farm|er
be unwilling to lo&s;e a crop. It is indeed a rob|ber;
better however any crop than run the ha|zard
of poi&s;oning the &s;oil with weeds. But to
prevent the nece&s;&s;ity of barley after wheat, the
land ought to be fallowed before the wheat: it
cleans the ground thoroughly, and makes pea&s;e
a &s;ecure crop after wheat. And after a good crop
of pea&s;e, barley never fails. A hor&s;e-hoed crop of
turnip is equal to a fallow for rooting out weeds;
but turnip does not &s;uit land that is proper for
wheat. Cabbage does well in wheat-&s;oil; and a
hor&s;e-hoed crop of cabbage, which eradicates
weeds, is a good prepartion for wheat to be &s;uc|ceeded
by pea&s;e; and a crop of beans diligently
hand-hoed is in that view little inferior. As red
clover requires the ground to be perfectly clean,
a good crop of it en&s;ures wheat, and next pea&s;e.
In loam, a drilled crop of turnip or potatoes pre|pares
the ground, equal to a fallow, for the &s;ame
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Another rule is, to avoid a frequent repetition
of the &s;ame &s;pecies; for to produce good crops,
change of &s;pecies is no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than change
of &s;eed. The &s;ame &s;pecies returning every &s;econd
<PB N="132" REF="158">
or third year, will infallibly degenerate, and be
a &s;canty crop. This is remarkably the ca&s;e of red
clover. Nor will our fields bear plea&s;antly per|petual
crops of wheat after fallow, which is the
practice of &s;ome Engli&s;h farmers.</P>
<P>Hitherto of rotation in the &s;ame field. I add
one rule concerning rotation in different fields;
which is, to avoid crouding crops one after another
in point of time; but to chu&s;e &s;uch as admit in|tervals
&s;ufficient for lei&s;urely dre&s;&s;ing, which gives
opportunity to manage all with the &s;ame hands, and
with the &s;ame cattle; for example, beans in Ja|nuary
or February, pea&s;e and oats in March, bar|ley
and potatoes in April, turnip in June or July,
wheat and rye in October.</P>
<P>For illu&s;trating the foregoing rules, a few in|&s;tances
of exceptionable rotations, will not be
thought ami&s;s. The following is an u&s;ual rotation
in Norfolk. Fir&s;t, wheat after red clover. Se|cond,
barley. Third, turnip. Fourth, barley with
red clover. Fifth, clover cut for hay. Sixth, a
&s;econd year's crop of clover commonly pa&s;tured.
Dung is given to the wheat and turnip. Again&s;t this
rotation &s;everal objections lie. Barley after wheat
is improper. The two crops of barley are too
near together. The &s;econd crop of clover mu&s;t
be very bad, if pa&s;turing be the be&s;t way of con|&s;uming
it; and if bad, it is a great encourager of
weeds. But the &s;tronge&s;t objection is, that red
clover repeated &s;o frequently in the &s;ame field can|not
<PB N="133" REF="159">
not fail to degenerate; and of this the Norfolk
farmers begin to be &s;en&s;ible. Salton in Ea&s;t Lo|thian
is a clay &s;oil; and the rotation there is,
wheat after fallow and dung. Second, barley af|ter
two ploughings; the one before winter, the
the other immediately before the &s;eed is &s;own.
Third, oats. Fourth, pea&s;e. Fifth, barley. Sixth,
oats: and then fallow. This rotation con&s;i&s;ts
chiefly of robbing crops. Pea&s;e are the only le|guminous
crop, which even with the fallow is not
&s;ufficient to loo&s;en a &s;tiff &s;oil. But the &s;oil is good,
which in &s;ome mea&s;ure hides the badne&s;s of the ro|tation.
About Seaton, and all the way from Pre|&s;ton
to Go&s;sford, the ground is &s;till more &s;everely
handled: wheat after fallow and dung, barley,
oats, pea&s;e, wheat, barley, oats, and then an|other
fallow. The &s;oil is excellent; and it ought
indeed to be &s;o, to &s;upport many rounds of &s;uch
cropping.</P>
<P>But let not our wonder be confined to this nar|row
&s;pot; for what better do we find in the great|e&s;t
part of this county? In the pari&s;hes of Tra|nent,
Aberlady, Dirleton, Northberwick, and
Athel&s;tonefoord, the following rotations were for|merly
univer&s;al, and to this day are much more
frequent than any other mode.</P>
<P>1. After fallow with dung, wheat, barley, oats,
pea&s;e and beans, barley, oats, wheat.</P>
<P>2. After fallow and dung, barley, oats, pea&s;e
and beans, wheat, barley, oats, pea&s;e, wheat.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="160">
3. After fallow and dung, wheat, oats, pea&s;e,
barley, oats, wheat.</P>
<P>4. After fallow and dung, barley, oats, beans,
wheat, pea&s;e, barley, oats.</P>
<P>Ea&s;t Lothian, time out of mind, has been fa|mous
for &s;uperior &s;kill in agriculture; and yet, to
&s;eek for in&s;truction there, one would be greatly
mi&s;ted. That county, for the richne&s;s of its crops,
is more indebted to the fertility of its &s;oil, than to
the &s;kill of its farmers. What pity it is, that &s;o
fine a county &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by men &s;o little
grateful to nature for her bounties! But their in|gratitude
is not &s;uffered to pa&s;s with impunity.
Every farmer complains that his crops are not &s;uch
as they have been: the decay is vi&s;ible; but the
cau&s;e, however obvious, is not manife&s;t to every
one. Some few who ju&s;tly a&s;cribe the decay to
&s;everity of cropping, have ventured upon &s;ome
alterations; but &s;o imperfectly, from the prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of former practice, as to have made no
con&s;iderable progre&s;s. The following rotations,
held to be improvements upon the former practice,
will ju&s;tify this ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>1. After fallow without dung, barley, clover.
Dung laid on the clover-&s;tuble, and after a &s;ingle
ploughing, wheat, barley, oats.</P>
<P>2. After fallow with dung, wheat, barley,
pea&s;e, wheat.</P>
<P>3. After fallow with dung, wheat, beans hand-hoed,
<PB N="135" REF="161">
wheat, pea&s;e and beans drilled, wheat with
dung, barley, clover. Dung laid on the clove$-&s;tubble.
Spring-wheat, one furrow before winter,
and one before &s;owing. Turnip broadca&s;t, bar|ley
and gra&s;s-&s;eeds for pa&s;ture.</P>
<P>4. After fallow with dung, wheat, barley with
clover-&s;eed. Clover made hay two years. After
the &s;econd year's crop, fallow and dung for wheat,
barley, oats, pea&s;e, oats or wheat, turnip with
dung, barley, pea&s;e, barley, oats.</P>
<P>5. Potatoes dunged, wheat, pea&s;e, barley and
gra&s;s-&s;eeds.</P>
<P>6. After fallow with dung, wheat, oats, pea&s;e
or elover, wheat, oats, clover. The clover-&s;tub|ble
dunged for barley, oats, pea&s;e after two fur|rows,
wheat after one furrow.</P>
<P>7. Lincoln barley upon ground opened from
pa&s;ture-gra&s;s, pea&s;e, wheat, turnip, barley, clo|ver.
The &s;tubble dunged for wheat, beans, bar|ley,
oats.</P>
<P>8. After fallow and dung, barley, clover red
and white for hay, pa&s;ture &s;even years, oats,
pea&s;e, wheat, barley, oats.</P>
<P>9. Turnip after lime and dung. Barley, with
which white clover, yellow clover, tyegra&s;s, and
ribwort, are &s;own. Pa&s;tured with &s;heep &s;even
years, broken up for oats, drilled beans, barley,
oats.</P>
<P>The&s;e rotations are far from being orthodox;
but it is good to be convinced of an error: and
<PB N="136" REF="162">
when once a reformation is fairly begun, it is to
be hoped, that the farmers in the be&s;t county of
Scotland, will at la&s;t &s;ettle in &s;uch a rotation of
crops, as will prove no le&s;s beneficial to them&s;elves
than to their landlords.</P>
<P>After &s;uch &s;evere cen&s;ure I would gladly make
&s;ome apology for the Ea&s;t-Lothian farmers. In
the &s;everal Tours of Young the itinerant farmer,
are found, in the be&s;t counties of England, ex|amples
without end, of rotations no le&s;s excep|tionable
than many of tho&s;e mentioned.</P>
<P>Where a field is laid down for pa&s;ture in order
to be recruited, it is commonly left in that &s;tate
many years; for it is the univer&s;al opinion, that
the longer it lies, the richer it becomes for bear|ing
corn. This I believe to be true; but in or|der
to determine the mode of cropping, the im|portant
point is, what upon the whole is the mo&s;t
profitable rotation; not what may produce luxu|riant
crops at a di&s;tant period. Upon that point,
I have no he&s;itation to affirm, that the farmer who
keeps a field in pa&s;ture beyond a certain time,
lo&s;es every year con&s;iderably; and that a few lu|xuriant
crops of corn, after twenty years of pa|&s;ture,
and &s;till more after thirty, will not make
up the lo&s;s. The novelty of this propofition will
di&s;credit it with the generality; but as the &s;ubject
is of capital importance in the management of a
farm, I mu&s;t notwith&s;tanding hope for a patient
hearing. Gra&s;s-&s;eeds intended for hay, produce
<PB N="137" REF="163">
the weightie&s;t crop at fir&s;t: were hay to be taken
many years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively without manure, the crops
would turn exceeding &s;canty. To prevent lo&s;s,
the farmer confines him&s;elf to two or three crops;
and then &s;urrenders the field to pa&s;ture. The
&s;ame happens where a field is laid down with pa|&s;ture-gra&s;&s;es:
the fir&s;t year's pa&s;ture is more plen|tiful
than any of the &s;ucceeding. For a proof of
which, a field newly laid down for pa&s;ture will
draw a greater rent, than after being pa&s;tured
&s;even or eight years; if I &s;hould &s;ay double, it
would not be far from truth. Nor is it difficult
to a&s;&s;ign a cau&s;e for the degeneracy. A tree de|prived
of its top, &s;preads into a bu&s;h, and never
again takes to a head. Gra&s;s plants are &s;imilar:
the be&s;t crops are always at fir&s;t; and they le&s;&s;en
gradually, becau&s;e the plants dwarf gradually.
The&s;e plants have certainly not better <HI>&s;tamina vi|tae</HI>
than an oak: if the latter turn dwarfi&s;h by ha|ving
its head lopped off, what can be expected
from humble vegetables that are cropped every day
and every hour? The dwarfing of plants how|ever
is confined within a certain limit; otherwi&s;e
they would in time di&s;appear altogether. But as
they never after increa&s;e in &s;ize, they cannot give
much food. The food they give, improves indeed
in quality, and turns richer the older it is; which
is vi&s;ible by the effects of old gra&s;s upon milk,
butter, beef, and mutton. Old gra&s;s is valuable
in point of luxury, but far from valuable in point
<PB N="138" REF="164">
of profit. The preci&s;e time when gra&s;s ought to
yield to corn, depends greatly on the nature of the
&s;oil. Our be&s;t director is practice. I will only
venture to &s;ugge&s;t, that clay &s;oil may, without
lo&s;s, be kept in pa&s;ture much longer than gravelly
or light &s;oil. The former being retentive of moi|&s;ture,
pre&s;erves gra&s;s in vigour, even during the
heat of &s;ummer: gra&s;s in the latter &s;oon withers
by lack of moi&s;ture. This is providential: a light
or gravelly &s;oil can be cultivated almo&s;t in any &s;ea|&s;on:
clay is extremely tickli&s;h; and where &s;uc|ce&s;sfully
laid down for pa&s;ture, one would not be
in a hurry to take it up again; e&s;pecially as it
maintains more cattle, and con&s;equently receives
more dung, than the other kind. It is extreme|ly
true, that a greater number of corn-crops may
be &s;ucce&s;sfully taken upon a field that has been
long in pa&s;ture, than when pa&s;tured but a few
years. But will the additional crops of corn o|verbalance
the mean returns from old gra&s;s? Far
from it. Why not then re&s;tore a field to corn as
&s;oon as the pa&s;ture begins to fail? The corn will
quadruple the value of the pa&s;ture: the labour
indeed and expence is greater; but they will be
amply recompen&s;ed by the profit.</P>
<P>Though there can lie no objection again&s;t this
mode of cropping with re&s;pect to profit, a &s;pe|cious
objection may occur with re&s;pect to the effect
it has upon the &s;oil. It may be &s;u&s;pected with
&s;ome &s;hew of rea&s;on, that plentiful crops without
<PB N="139" REF="165">
re&s;t, mu&s;t in time exhau&s;t the &s;oil, unle&s;s prevent|ed
by extraordinary manure. Experience is our
only means for clearing that doubt; but till the
truth be a&s;certained by experience, one would
not he&s;itate to venture a mode of cropping that is
clearly &s;o profitable; con&s;idering, that, at the
wor&s;t, the &s;oil can be re&s;tored by diligent culture,
and extraordinary manure. But I &s;ay more. It
will be made evident in the &s;econd part, that a
&s;oil well pulverized, and yet not too loo&s;e, is what
affords the greate&s;t quantity of food to plants.
Now the mode of cropping above recommended
is intended to pre&s;erve the &s;oil in that &s;tate, and
mu&s;t infallibly an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. However
plentiful therefore the crops may be, this mode of
cropping cannot exhau&s;t the &s;oil.</P>
<P>To be obliged to &s;tand &s;ingle again&s;t all the
world, would make me tremble like an a&s;pin
leaf, were it not impre&s;&s;ed upon me, that the dif|ference
is greater in appearance than in reality.
What I have all along had in view, is a field &s;own
with gra&s;s-&s;eeds, not for hay, but for pa&s;ture,
&s;uch as white clover, yellow clover, ribwort, rye|gra&s;s.
The fir&s;t crop of &s;uch gra&s;&s;es is undoubt|edly
the weightie&s;t; and there is a diminution in
quantity annually, till after &s;even or eight years
there is not half of the food for cattle that was at
fir&s;t. The plan recommended above, is to take
up the field at that period; and after a few corn|e$ops,
to lay it down again for pa&s;ture. The opi|nion
<PB N="140" REF="166">
I am oppo&s;ing, is certainly right according
to the common method of laying down ground
for gra&s;s. This method is, to &s;ow the field with
ryegra&s;s and red clover, and, after taking hay two
years, to &s;urrender it for pa&s;ture. By this me|thod,
the pa&s;ture mu&s;t undoubtedly be wor&s;t at
fir&s;t: at the end of the two years the red clover
is gone, leaving nothing but the ryegra&s;s, which
does not occupy the fifth part of the ground.
The field accordingly is exceedingly bare for three
or four years; and is not covered till natural
gra&s;&s;es &s;pring up to fill the place of tho&s;e that are
gone, which, in clay &s;oil e&s;pecially, will be very
late. From this time, the pa&s;ture mends as the
natural gra&s;&s;es thicken; and after a certain pe|riod,
if they do not improve in quantity, they cer|tainly
improve in quality. But not to mention,
that gra&s;&s;es which thus occa&s;ionally occupy a field,
are not equal to &s;own gra&s;&s;es for feeding; what I
affirm is, that the farmer pays dear for them,
when he mu&s;t &s;ubmit in the interim to very fcanty
crops.</P>
<P>If the le&s;&s;on here inculcated be &s;olidly founded,
it mu&s;t produce a great change in the manage|ment
of a farm. Pa&s;ture-gra&s;s, while young,
maintains many animals; and the field is greatly
recruited by what they drop: it is even recruited
by hay-crops, provided the gra&s;s be cut before
&s;eeding. But as old gra&s;s yields little profit, the
field ought to be taken up for corn when the pa|&s;ture
<PB N="141" REF="167">
begins to fail; and after a few crops, it
ought to be laid down again with gra&s;s-&s;eeds. Se|duced
by a chimerical notion, that a field, by fre|quent
corn-crops, is fatigued and requires re&s;t,
like a labouring man or animal, careful farmers
give long re&s;t to their fields by pa&s;ture, never ad|verting
that it affords little profit. Pity it is, that
by a chimerical noticed they &s;hould be tantalized,
to neglect good crops within their reach. It
ought to be their &s;tudy, to improve their &s;oil, by
making it free and al&s;o retentive of moi&s;ture. If
they accompli&s;h the&s;e ends, they need not be a|fraid
of exhau&s;ting the &s;oil by cropping<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">As vegetable and animal food are equally natural to man, it is admirable in Providence, to adju&s;t the foil $e treads on &s;o happily to his nature, as to yield him more &s;ood by a rotation of corn and gra&s;s crops, than if it were confined to either.</NOTE></P>
<P>Where a farmer has acce&s;s to no manure but
what is his own production, the ca&s;e under con|&s;ideration,
there are various rotations of crops, all
of them good, though perhaps not equally &s;o. I
&s;hall begin with two examples, one in clay, and
one in free &s;oil, each of the farms ninety acres.
Six acres are to be inclo&s;ed for a kitchen-garden,
in which there mu&s;t be annually a crop of red clo|ver,
for &s;ummer-food to the working cattle. As
there are annually twelve acres in hay, and twelve
in pa&s;ture, a &s;ingle plough with good cattle will
be &s;ufficient to command the remaining &s;ixty
acres.</P>

<P>When the rotation is completed, the &s;eventh
inclo&s;ure having been &s;ix years in pa&s;ture, is ready
to be taken up for a rotation of crops, which be|gins
with oats in the year 1781, and proceeds as
in the &s;ixth inclo&s;ure. In the &s;ame year 1781,
the fifth inclo&s;ure is made pa&s;ture; for which it
is prepared, by &s;owing pa&s;ture gra&s;s-&s;eeds with
the barley of the year 1780. And in this manner
may the rotation be carried on without end.
Here the labour is equally di&s;tributed; and there
is no hurry nor confu&s;ion. But the chief proper|ty
of this rotation is, that two culmiferous or
white-corn crops, are never found together: by a
due mixture of crops, the &s;oil is pre&s;erved in good
heart without any adventitious manure. At the
<PB N="143" REF="169">
&s;ame time, the land is always producing plentiful
crops: neither hay nor pa&s;ture get time to dege|nerate.
The whole dung is laid upon the fallow.</P>
<P>Every farm that takes a gra&s;s-crop into the ro|tation
mu&s;t be inclo&s;ed, which is peculiarly nece&s;|&s;ary
in a clay &s;oil, as nothing is more hurtful to
clay than poaching.</P>

<P>Many other rotations may be contrived, keep|ing
to the rules above laid down. Fallow, for
example, wheat, pea&s;e and beans, barley, cab|bage,
oats, for clay. Here dung mu&s;t be given
both to the wheat and cabbage. For free &s;oil,
drilled turnip, barley, red clover, wheat upon a
&s;ingle furrow, drilled potatoes, oats. Both the
turnip and potatoes mu&s;t have dung. Another for
free &s;oil: turnip drilled and dunged, red clover;
wheat on a &s;ingle &s;urrow with dung, pea&s;e, bar|ley,
potatoes, oats. The following rotation has
<PB N="145" REF="171">
proved &s;ucce&s;sful in a &s;oil proper for wheat. 1.
Oats with red clover, after fallow, without dung.
2. Hay. The clover-&s;tubble dunged, and wheat
&s;own end of October with a &s;ingle &s;urrow. 3.
Wheat. 4. Pea&s;e. 5. Barley. Fallow again.
Oats are taken the fir&s;t crop to &s;ave the dung for
the wheat. Oats always thrive on a fallow, though
without dung; which is not the ca&s;e of barley.
But barley &s;eldom fails after pea&s;e. In &s;trong
clay &s;oil, the following rotation an&s;wers. 1.
Wheat after fallow and dung. 2. Beans &s;own
under furrow as early as po&s;&s;ible. Above the
beans, &s;ow pea&s;e end of March, half a boll per
acre, and harrow them in. The two grains will
ripen at the &s;ame time. 3. Oats or barley on a
winter-furrow with gra&s;s-&s;eeds. 4. Hay for one
year or two; the &s;econd growth pa&s;tured. Lay
what dung can be &s;pared on the hay-&s;tubble, and
&s;ow wheat with a &s;ingle &s;urrow. 5. Wheat. 6.
Beans or pea&s;e. 7. Oats. Fallow again.</P>

<P>CULMIFEROUS plants are ripe when the &s;tem is
totally white: they are not fully ripe if any
green &s;treaks remain. Some farmers are of opi|nion,
<PB N="146" REF="172">
that wheat ought to be cut before it is fully
ripe. Their rea&s;ons are, fir&s;t, that ripe wheat
is apt to &s;hake, and, next, that the flour is not
&s;o good. With re&s;pect to the la&s;t, it is contrary
to nature, that any &s;eed can be better in an unripe
&s;tate, than when brought to perfection: nor will
it be found &s;o upon trial. With re&s;pect to the
fir&s;t, wheat, at the point of perfection, is not
more apt to &s;hake than for &s;ome days before: the
hu&s;k begins not to open till after the &s;eed is fully
ripe; and then the &s;uffering the crop to &s;tand be|comes
tickli&s;h: after the minute of ripening, it
&s;hould be cut down in an in&s;tant, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>This leads to the hands that are commonly en|gaged
to cut down corn. In this country, the u|niver&s;al
practice was, to provide a number of
hands, in proportion to the extent of the crop,
without regard to the time of ripening. By this
method, the reapers were often idle for want of
work; and what is much wor&s;e, they had often
more work than they could overtake, and ripe
fields were laid open to &s;haking winds. The Lo|thians
have long enjoyed weekly markets for
reapers, where a farmer can provide him&s;elf with
the number he wants; and this practice is creep|ing
into neighbouring &s;hires. Where there is no
opportunity of &s;uch markets, ought not neigh|bouring
farmers to agree in borrowing and lend|ing
their reapers? The advantage is obvious;
and yet I believe it is &s;eldom practi&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="173">
One &s;hould imagine, that a caveat again&s;t cut|ting
corn when wet, is unnece&s;&s;ary; yet from the
impatience of farmers to prevent &s;haking, no ca|veat
is more &s;o. Why do they not con&s;ider, that
corn &s;tanding, dries in half a day, when in a clo&s;e
&s;heaf, the weather mu&s;t be favourable if it dry in a
month? in moi&s;t weather it will never dry.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the manner of cutting, I mu&s;t
premi&s;e, that barley is of all the mo&s;t difficult
grain to be dried for keeping. Having no hu&s;k,
rain has ea&s;y acce&s;s; and it has a tendency to mal|ten
when wet. Where the ground is properly
&s;moothed by rolling, I am clear for cutting it
down with the &s;ythe. This manner being more
expeditious than the &s;ickle, removes it &s;ooner
from the danger of wind; and gives a third more
&s;traw, which is a capital article for dung, where a
farm is at a di&s;tance from other manure. I ex|cept
only corn that has lodged; for there the &s;ic|kle
is more convenient than the &s;ythe. As it
ought to be dry when cut, bind it up directly: if
allowed to lie any time in the &s;wath, it is apt to
be di&s;coloured.</P>
<P>Barley &s;own with gra&s;s-&s;eeds, red clover e&s;pe|cially,
requires a different management. Where
the gra&s;s is cut along with it, the difficulty is great
of getting it &s;o dry as to be ventured in a &s;tack.
The cunning way is, to cut the barley with a &s;ickle
above the clover, &s;o as that nothing but clean
barley is bound up. Cut with a &s;ythe the &s;tubble
<PB N="148" REF="174">
and gra&s;s: they make excellent winter-food. The
&s;ame method is applicable to oats; with this only
difference, that when the field is expo&s;ed to the
&s;outh-we&s;t wind, it is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to bind im|mediately
after mowing. As wheat commonly
grows higher than any other grain, it is difficult
to manage it with the &s;ythe; for which rea&s;on
the &s;ickle is preferred in England. Pea&s;e and
beans grow &s;o irregularly, as to make the &s;ickle
nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The be&s;t way for drying pea&s;e, is to keep &s;e|parate
the handfuls that are cut: though in this
way they wet ea&s;ily, they dry as &s;oon. In the
common way of heaping pea&s;e together for com|po&s;ing
a &s;heaf, they wet as ea&s;ily, and dry not
near &s;o &s;oon. With re&s;pect to beans, the top of
the handful la&s;t cut, ought to be laid on the bot|tom
of the former; which gives ready acce&s;s to
the wind. By this method pea&s;e and beans are
ready for the &s;tack in half the ordinary time.</P>
<P>The &s;ize of the &s;heaves ought to be regarded.
A &s;heaf commonly is made as large as can be
comained in two lengths of the corn made into a
rope. To &s;ave frequent tying, the binder pre&s;&s;es
it down with his knee, and binds it &s;o hard as to|tally
to exclude the air. If there be any moi&s;ture
in the crop, which &s;eldom fails, a proce&s;s of fer|mentation
and putrefaction commences in the
&s;heaf; which is perfected in the &s;tack, to the de|&s;truction
both of corn and &s;traw. How barba|rous
<PB N="149" REF="175">
and &s;tupid is it, to make the &s;ize of a &s;heaf
depend on the height of the plants! By that
rule, a wheat-&s;heaf is commonly &s;o weighty, as to
be unmanageable by ordinary arms: it requires
an effort to move it, that frequently bur&s;ts the
knot, and occa&s;ions lo&s;s of grain, be&s;ide the trou|ble
of a &s;econd tying. I have long practi&s;ed the
following method with &s;ucce&s;s. My &s;heaves are
never larger than to be contained in one length
of the plant, cut clo&s;e to the ground: I admit no
exception if the plants be above eighteen inches
high. The binder's arm compre&s;&s;es the &s;heaf
&s;ufficiently, without need of his knee. The addi|tional
hands that this way of binding may require,
are not to be regarded, compared with the advan|tage
of drying &s;oon. Corn thus managed may be
ready for the &s;tack in a week: it &s;eldom in the
ordinary way requires le&s;s than a fortnight, and
frequently longer. Of a &s;mall &s;heaf compre&s;&s;ed
by the arm only, the air pervades every part;
nor is it &s;o apt to be unloo&s;ed as a large &s;heaf,
however firmly bound. I omit the gathering of
&s;heaves into &s;hocks, becau&s;e the common method
is orthodox, which is to place the &s;hocks directed
to the &s;outh we&s;t, in order to re&s;i&s;t the force of
that wind. Five &s;heaves on each &s;ide make a
&s;ufficient &s;tay; and a greater number cannot be
covered with two head-&s;heaves.</P>
<P>Every article is of importance that ha&s;tens the
operation, in a country like Scotland, &s;ubjected to
<PB N="150" REF="176">
unequal harve&s;t-weather; for which rea&s;on, the
mo&s;t expeditious method &s;hould be cho&s;en for
carrying corn from the field to the &s;tack-yard.
Our carriages are generally too &s;mall or too large.
A &s;ledge is a very aukward machine: many hands
are required, and little progre&s;s made. Waggons
and large carts are little le&s;s dilatory, as they mu&s;t
&s;tand in the yard till unloaded &s;heaf by &s;heaf. My
way is, to u&s;e long carts moveable upon the axle,
&s;o as at once to throw the whole load on the
ground; which is forked up to the &s;tack by a
hand appointed for that purpo&s;e. By this me|thod,
two carts will do the work of four or five.</P>
<P>It will not be ea&s;y to convince me, that build|ing
round &s;tacks in the yard is not preferable to
hou&s;ing the corn. There it is &s;hut up from the
air; and it mu&s;t be exceedingly dry, if it contract
not a mu&s;tine&s;s, which is the fir&s;t &s;tep to putrefac|tion.
Let me add another circum&s;tance, which
would make a figure were it detached from that
now mentioned. In the yard, a &s;tack is pre&s;erved
from rats and mice by being &s;et on a pede&s;tal:
no method has hitherto been invented, for pre&s;er|ving
corn in a hou&s;e from &s;uch de&s;tructive ver|min.
The proper manner of building, is to make
every &s;heaf incline downward from its top to its
bottom. Where the &s;heaves are laid horizontally,
the &s;tack will take in rain both above and be|low.
The be&s;t form of a &s;tack is that of a cone
placed on a cylinder; and the top of the cone
<PB N="151" REF="177">
&s;hould be formed with three &s;heaves drawn to a
point. If the upper part of the cylinder be a little
wider than the under, &s;o much the better.</P>
<P>The delaying to cover a &s;tack for two or three
weeks, though common, is however wonderfully
ab&s;urd; for if much rain fall in the interim, it is
beyond the power of wind to dry the &s;tack. Ve|getation
begun in the external parts, &s;huts out
the air from the internal; and to prevent a total
putrefaction, the &s;tack mu&s;t be thrown down, and
expo&s;ed to the air, every &s;heaf. In order to have
a &s;tack covered the moment it is fini&s;hed, &s;traw
and ropes ought to be ready; and the covering
ought to be &s;o thick as to be proof again&s;t rain.</P>
<P>Scotland is &s;ubject not only to floods of rain, but
to high winds. Good covering guards again&s;t the
former, and ropes artfully applied guards again&s;t
the latter. I will an&s;wer for the following mode.
Take a hay-rope well twi&s;ted, and &s;urround the
&s;tack with it, two feet or &s;o below the top. Sur|round
the &s;tack with another &s;uch rope immedi|ately
below the ea&s;ing. Connect the&s;e two with
ropes in an up and down po&s;ition, di&s;tant from
each other at the ea&s;ing about five or &s;ix feet.
Then &s;urround the &s;tack with other circular
ropes parallel to the two fir&s;t mentioned, giving
them a twi&s;t round every one of tho&s;e that lie up
and down, by which the whole will be connected
together in a &s;ort of network. What remains is,
to fini&s;h the two feet at the top of the &s;tack. Let
<PB N="152" REF="178">
it be covered with bunches of &s;traw laid regularly
up and down; the under part to be put under the
circular rope fir&s;t mentioned, which will keep it
fa&s;t, and the upper part be bound by a &s;mall rope
artfully twi&s;ted, commonly called <HI>the crown of
the &s;tack.</HI> This method is preferable to the com|mon
way of laying long ropes over the top of the
&s;tack, and tying them to the belting-rope; which
flattens the top, and makes it take in rain. A
&s;tack covered in the way here de&s;cribed, will &s;tand
two years &s;ecure both again&s;t wind and rain; a
notable advantage in this variable climate. So
much for corn. Now for hay.</P>
<P>The great aim in making hay is, to pre&s;erve as
much of the &s;ap as po&s;&s;ible. All agree in this;
and yet differ widely in the means of making
that aim effectual. To de&s;cribe all the different
means might be profitable to the book&s;eller; but
the reader would lo&s;e patience, and gather no in|&s;truction.
I &s;hall therefore confine my&s;elf to what
I think the be&s;t. A crop of ryegra&s;s and yellow
clover ought to be &s;pread as cut. A day or two
after, when the dew is evaporated, rake it into a
number of parallel rows along the field, termed
<HI>wind-rows,</HI> for the convenience of putting it up
into &s;mall cocks. After turning the rows once
and again, make &s;mall cocks weighing a &s;tone or
two. At the di&s;tance of two days or &s;o, put two
cocks into one, ob&s;erving always to mix the tops
and bottoms together, and to take a new place
<PB N="153" REF="179">
for each cock, that the lea&s;t damage po&s;&s;ible may
be done to the gra&s;s. Proceed in putting two
cocks into one, till &s;ufficiently dry for tramp-ricks
of 100 &s;tone each. The ea&s;ie&s;t way of erecting
tramp-ricks, is to found a rick in the middle of
the row of cocks that are to compo&s;e it. The
cocks may be carried to the rick by two per&s;ons
joining arms together. When all the cocks are
thus carried to the rick within the di&s;tance of forty
yards or &s;o, the re&s;t of the cocks will be more
expeditiou&s;ly carried to the rick, by a rope wound
about them and dragged by a hor&s;e. Two ropes
are &s;ufficient to &s;ecure the ricks from wind, the
&s;hort time they are to &s;tand in the field. This
very year, 1775, ten thou&s;and &s;tone were put into
tramp-ricks the fourth day after cutting. In a
country &s;o wet as many parts of Scotland are, ex|pedition
is of mighty con&s;equence in the drying
both of hay and corn. With re&s;pect to hay in|tended
for horned cattle, it is by the generality
held an improvement, that it be heated a little in
the &s;tack. But I violently &s;u&s;pect this doctrine to
have been invented for excu&s;ing indolent manage|ment.
An ox, it is true, will eat &s;uch hay; but
I have always found that he prefers &s;weet hay;
and it cannot well be doubted, but that &s;uch hay
is the mo&s;t &s;alutary and the mo&s;t nouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>The making hay con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of red clo|ver,
requires more care. The &s;ea&s;on of cutting
is the la&s;t week of June, when it is in full bloom:
<PB N="154" REF="180">
earlier it may be cut, but never later. To cut it
later, would indeed produce a weightier crop; but
a late fir&s;t cutting makes the &s;econd al&s;o late, per|haps
too late for drying. At the &s;ame time, the
want of weight in an early fir&s;t cutting, is amply
compen&s;ated by the weight of the &s;econd.</P>
<P>The additional labour required to make hay of
red clover, ari&s;es from the largene&s;s of the &s;tem,
and the hazard of the leaves dropping off in moi&s;t
weather. I have tried two methods. One is, to
let it lie in the &s;wath two days, and longer if the
weather be unfavourable. The &s;waths mu&s;t be
turned over and over two or three times every
day, but not unle&s;s the weather be dry. It will
then be ready to be put into cocks, containing each
about two &s;tone. After two, three, or four days,
according to the weather, let two cocks be put
into one; and &s;o on at proper intervals till ready
for the tramp-rick. The other way, more expe|ditious,
may be ventured on where ryegra&s;s is
mixed with the clover. Stir it not the day it is
cut. Turn it in the &s;wath the forenoon of the
next day; and in the afternoon put it up in &s;mall
cocks. The third day, put two cocks into one,
enlarging every day the cocks till they be ready
for the tramp-rick.</P>
<P>When the &s;ea&s;on is too variable for making hay
of the &s;econd growth, mix &s;traw with that growth,
which will be a &s;ub&s;tantial food for cattle during
winter. This is commonly done by laying &s;trata
<PB N="155" REF="181">
of the &s;traw and clover alternately in the &s;tack.
But this method I cannot approve: if the &s;trata
of clover do not heat, they turn mouldy at lea&s;t,
and unpalatable. The better way is, to mix them
carefully with the hand before they be put into
the &s;tack. The dry &s;traw imbibes moi&s;ture from
the clover, and prevents heating.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t add in general with re&s;pect to hay of
whatever kind, that if the weather be &s;o wet as
to prevent cocking in the ordinary time, there
ought to be no intermi&s;&s;ion in turning the &s;waths;
which will help to evaporate the moi&s;ture, if there
be any motion in the air; and at the &s;ame time,
prevent the &s;waths from &s;inking into the ground
among the uncut gra&s;s, which never &s;ails to blanch
it.</P>
<P>The expence of making an acre of hay, com|po&s;ed
of ryegra&s;s and yellow clover, is, in a tole|rable
&s;ea&s;on, from four to &s;ix &s;hillings; and from
&s;ix to eight if compo&s;ed of red clover. This how|ever
is an uncertain computation, the expence
differing greatly in a good or bad &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>I will not &s;top to give any rule for making hay
of natural gra&s;s, termed <HI>meadow-hay;</HI> becau&s;e
in a well-conducted farm there ought to be no
meadow-hay. This is made evident in the chap|ter
<HI>Rotation of Crops.</HI></P>
<P>In the yard, a &s;tack of hay ought to be an ob|long
&s;quare, if the quantity be greater than to be
ea&s;ily &s;towed in a round &s;tack: becau&s;e a &s;maller
<PB N="156" REF="182">
&s;urface is expo&s;ed to the air, than in a number of
round &s;tacks. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, a &s;tack of
pea&s;e ought to have the &s;ame form, the &s;traw be|ing
more valuable than that of oats, wheat, or
barley. The moment a &s;tack is fini&s;hed, it
ought to be covered; becau&s;e the &s;urface-hay
is much damaged by withering in dry weather,
and moi&s;tening in wet weather. Let it have a pa|vilion-roof;
for more of it can be covered with
&s;traw in that &s;hape, than when built perpendicu|lar
at the ends. Let it be roped as directed a|bove
for corn-&s;tacks; with this difference only,
that in an oblong &s;quare the ropes mu&s;t be
thrown over the top, and tied to the belt-rope
below. This belt-rope ought to be fixed with
pins to the &s;tack; the rea&s;on is, that the ropes
thrown over the &s;tack will bag by the &s;inking of
the &s;tack, and may be drawn tight by lowering
the belt-rope, and fixing it in its new po&s;ition with
the &s;ame pins.</P>
<P>The &s;tems of hops, being long and tough,
make excellent ropes; and it will be a &s;aving ar|ticle,
to propagate a few plants of that kind for
that very end.</P>
<P>A &s;tack of ryegra&s;s-hay, a year old, and of a
moderate &s;ize, will weigh, each cubic yard, e|leven
Dutch &s;tone. A &s;tack of clover-hay in the
&s;ame circum&s;tances weighs &s;omewhat le&s;s.</P>
<P>I conclude this article with ob&s;erving, that till
lately the making hay was little under&s;tood in
<PB N="157" REF="183">
Scotland; nor to this day is it generally under|&s;tood.
The method was, to expo&s;e it as much as
po&s;&s;ible to the &s;un and wind, and never to give it
re&s;t till it was &s;o dry as to be grindable in a mill,
and rendered a <HI>caput mortuum.</HI> The poor ani|mals
reduced to &s;uch food, were truly to be pi|tied:
is it wonderful that they were too feeble
for work? But this made no impre&s;&s;ion, as the
feeblene&s;s of the cattle was but in proportion to
the lazine&s;s of the men. They had no check of
con&s;cience for being idle, becau&s;e they were edu|cated
in that way, and knew no better.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">FEEDING FARM-CATTLE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the management of corn
and hay, what naturally follows is, to ap|ply
them to the maintenance of farm-cattle: for
to con&s;ider them as the food of human beings,
falls not properly under any branch of agricul|ture.</P>
<P>As in this chapter are contained many different
matters upon which the profit of a farm greatly
depends, I wi&s;h to inculcate what I have to &s;ay
with per&s;picuity. In that view the chapter is di|vided
into five &s;ections. Green food is the &s;ub|ject
of the fir&s;t; dry food, of the &s;econd; feed|ing
for the butcher, of the third: the fourth con|tains
<PB N="158" REF="184">
rules for the wintering of cattle that are not
intended for immediate &s;ale; and the fifth, rules
for buying and &s;elling cattle and corn.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>1. GREEN FOOD.</HEAD>
<P>I being this &s;ection with the &s;ummer-food of
farm-hor&s;es. The manner of feeding them du|ring
&s;ummer, is and has been various through
Scotland: none of them good. Some time ago,
hor&s;es were fed in balks between ridges of corn,
which required the attendance of men, and wa|&s;ted
much time. In many parts, hor&s;es are re|duced
to thi&s;tles; the time of the men being con&s;u|med
in pulling, and of the hor&s;es in eating. In
&s;ome places, a part of the common pa&s;ture is re|&s;erved
for them, termed <HI>hained gra&s;s.</HI> The
man appointed to attend them falls a&s;leep, and
&s;uffers the hor&s;es to tre&s;pa&s;s on the corn. Dogs
are employed to cha&s;e them from it: they run
about; and their fatigue is little le&s;s than when at
work. To prevent this, the hor&s;es are &s;ometimes
tethered on the hained gra&s;s: the half is lo&s;t, be|ing
trodden under foot; be&s;ide that they often
break loo&s;e, and de&s;troy the &s;tanding corn. The
lea&s;t exceptionable is a gra&s;s-inclo&s;ure; and yet
far from de&s;erving approbation. In the fir&s;t
place, where the gra&s;s is &s;o rank as to fill the hor|&s;es
in the intervals of work, a fourth part at lea&s;t
is trodden under foot: the hor&s;es be&s;ide are pe|&s;tered
<PB N="159" REF="185">
in hot weather with flies, and cannot feed
with ea&s;e. In the next place, they have no time
for re&s;ting; and much time is lo&s;t in laying hold
of them for the yoke. La&s;tly, few inclo&s;ures in
the hands of a tenant, are in &s;o good order as to
keep in hor&s;es when they &s;ee corn; and if they
once break out, it is in vain to think of impri|&s;oning
them after. The approved method to pre|vent
every inconvenience, is to feed the hor&s;es
with cut gra&s;s, under cover. In the interval be|tween
the work of the forenoon and afternoon,
they can fill the belly in an hour, and have time
to re&s;t another hour: nor is a moment lo&s;t in yo|king.</P>
<P>Several plants &s;erve this purpo&s;e, &s;ainfoin, lu|cern,
red clover, white clover, ryegra&s;s. Red
clover is the be&s;t. Sainfoin and lucern early cut
are excellent food; but when they turn &s;trong
and reedy, hor&s;es are not fond of them. The di&s;|advantage
of white clover and ryegra&s;s, is, that,
being &s;mall plants, they are difficult to be collect|ed
in heaps for food. Red clover is extremely
luxuriant: it is ea&s;ily collected; and it ought to be
ea&s;ily collected; for to feed properly a hor&s;e of a
middle &s;ize, requires ten &s;tone a-day. It flowers
the fir&s;t week of June; but in rich &s;oil it will ri&s;e
to eighteen inches before flowering. So rapid is
its growth, that in good &s;oil it may be cut thrice
in a year, and afford over and above &s;ome pa&s;ture.
It &s;hould be cut in the morning when moi&s;t with
<PB N="160" REF="186">
dew: it is le&s;s palatable when cut dry. The cut|ting
ought to begin long before flowering; that
all may be cut before it is too old, and that it may
grow the fa&s;ter for a &s;econd cutting. The&s;e con|&s;iderations
are not &s;ufficiently attended to: people
are loath to cut till the clover is fully grown; tho'
early cutting will upon the whole afford more
food, as well as more palatable food, to hor&s;es
e&s;pecially, which di&s;like old clover. I de&s;pair not
to &s;ee all the corn-farmers in Scotland, depending
on red clover for the &s;ummer-food of their cattle;
and then we &s;hall no longer be &s;tunned with loud
complaints commonly thrown out as excu&s;es for
idlene&s;s: &startq;How can I improve, having no food
for my hor&s;es but bare lea or thi&s;tles? they
cannot work on &s;uch food; I cannot &s;tir a
foot.&endq; A hor&s;e works as he is fed: it is &s;ur|pri&s;ing
what work he will perform upon cut clo|ver,
without lo&s;ing fle&s;h. Many a &s;ummer, for
&s;even or eight weeks running, have my hor&s;es
been daily employed in bringing lime from a
quarry fifteen Engli&s;h miles di&s;tant, fed on red
clover only; and at the end of the &s;ea&s;on, as
plump and hearty as at the beginning. Let an|other
article be con&s;idered. In every farm, a
great proportion is left out for pa&s;ture, if that can
be called pa&s;ture which affords little or no food.
A &s;ingle acre of good red clover, will give more
food than fifteen or twenty &s;uch acres. How
<PB N="161" REF="187">
much better might the&s;e acres be employed in
bearing profitable crops of corn?</P>
<P>But a &s;kilful farmer will not confine him&s;elf to
red clover for &s;ummer-food. There are other
gra&s;&s;es that &s;pring more early, and grow later than
red clover. Ryegra&s;s, ribwort, and yellow clo|ver,
flower a month before red clover, are fully
ready for cutting green the middle of May, and
if cut at that time continue growing, and may be
cut a fortnight after red clover is gone. To en|large
the period of green food for cattle, is a de|&s;ireable
object in hu&s;bandry. It affords plenty of
food both early and late; it &s;aves pa&s;ture-fields in
&s;pring till the gra&s;s cover the ground, which re|tains
the dew, and &s;helters the gra&s;s-roots from
withering winds; and it enables the farmer to
leave his fields rough at the end of the &s;ea&s;on to
keep out the fro&s;t during winter, in&s;tead of eat|ing
them bare, which is the ordinary practice.
Now the&s;e &s;alutary effects, all of them, may be
procured by a very &s;imple operation; which is, to
fow part of the field with ryegra&s;s, ribwort, and
yellow clover mixed. The&s;e plants are ready for
being cut the middle of May; and if the &s;ea&s;on
prove favourable, they may be cut again as late
as even the middle of November. Cut gra&s;s is
of all the cheape&s;t food, and the mo&s;t agreeable
to hor&s;es; and therefore to add a month of this
food, is a valuable improvement; e&s;pecially during
&s;pring, for however nouri&s;hing dry food may be,
<PB N="162" REF="188">
yet a hor&s;e put upon green food turns remarkably
more agile and plump<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>It may be agreeable to bring under one view the gra&s;&s;es mentioned above, with re&s;pect to the &s;ea&s;on of their &s;hooting and ripening.</P>
<P>Ryegra&s;s &s;own in &s;pring with corn, &s;hoots the year fol|lowing, from the 20th to the 30th of April, according to the &s;oil and &s;ea&s;on. It flowers from the 1&s;t to the 10th of June. The flower continues about eight days, falls off, and the &s;eed at that time begins to form. The &s;eed is ripe between 1&s;t and 10th July. When it is fully formed, the &s;talk begins to turn brown; and more and more &s;o till the &s;eed fall, which is about the end of July.</P>
<P>Ribwort &s;hoots the la&s;t week of April. The head in a thriving plant is three inches long, full of &s;eed, which is completely ripe about the 10th of July. Upon the head are found at the &s;ame time &s;eed formed, flowers, and part that has not yet flowered.</P>
<P>Red clover &s;hoots from the 1&s;t to the 10th of June; and in eight days after begins to flower. It continues in flower twenty days; and about the end of July the &s;eed is ripe. The progre&s;s of white clover is preci&s;ely the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Yellow clover &s;hoots the la&s;t week of April, and flowers till Augu&s;t. On a &s;talk is found at the &s;ame time, &s;eed ripe, &s;eed half ripe, flowers, and &s;hoots ju&s;t beginning. It accordingly re&s;embles pea&s;e, and grows a long time. Its continual growing keeps the &s;tem full of &s;ap. The time of cutting plants for hay is in the middle of their flowering; but as yellow clover flowers much longer than the others mentioned, it affords a greater latitude for cutting without injuring the hay.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I proceed to the &s;ummer-food of horned cattle.
A bea&s;t that chews the cud, takes in at once a
<PB N="163" REF="189">
large quantity of green food, e&s;pecially of red clo|ver,
which is extremely palatable when young.
So large a quantity is apt to ferment with the
heat of the &s;tomach, &s;o as &s;ometimes to make the
creature bur&s;t. This is con&s;idered as a formi|dable
objection to the feeding horned cattle on
red clover. But it is ea&s;ily obviated, by feeding
them in the hou&s;e: &s;ervants will not readily give
more than &s;ufficient, when cutting and carrying is
a work of labour. And red clover &s;hould always
be cut for food; for where cattle have liberty to
pa&s;ture, more is trampled down than is eaten.
At any rate, bur&s;ting may be prevented even when
cattle are allowed to pa&s;ture. Indulge them but
half an hour or &s;o, for two or three days when the
clover is dry; after which there is no hazard. If
yellow clover and ribwort be &s;own with red clo|ver,
there is little or no hazard of fermenting to
&s;uch a degree as to be hurtful. White clover is
no remedy: it ferments in the &s;tomach as much
as red clover.</P>
<P>Red clover cut green, is preferable to all other
food for milk cows. Being &s;oon filled, they have
much time to re&s;t, which increa&s;e the quantity
of milk. The milk at the &s;ame time is richer
and higher coloured, than from any other food.</P>
<P>Red clover is good food for &s;heep; but the cut|ting
it for them would be too expen&s;ive. White
clover at the &s;ame time is their favourite, which
is never wanting in good &s;oil, growing naturally.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="190">
One &s;ignal advantage of feeding hor&s;es and
horned cattle in the hou&s;e during &s;ummer, is their
being protected from heat and in&s;ects. And it is
a &s;till more &s;ignal advantage, that the dung turns
to much better account, than when &s;cattered du|ring
&s;ummer in a pa&s;ture-field. Hor&s;e-dung in a
pa&s;ture-field is totally lo&s;t: it dries, and withers a|way,
not to mention that its heat burns the gra&s;s
it falls on. Dung is an article of great import|ance,
e&s;pecially in a farm di&s;tant from other ma|nure.
And a dunghill, procured by feeding on
cut gra&s;s, may be con&s;iderably increa&s;ed by feed|ing
the cattle with &s;traw; and by adding to the heap
every weed that grows in the farm, which at any
rate ought to be cut, to prevent &s;eeding.</P>
<P>The carrying cut gra&s;s from the field to the
&s;table, is a laborious work; and the only circum|&s;tance
that weighs again&s;t cut gra&s;s in competition
with pa&s;ture. A hor&s;e of a middle &s;ize will eat
ten Dutch &s;tone daily; &s;ome go the length of &s;e|venteen:
an ox or a cow will eat eight &s;tone.
Suppo&s;ing in a farm ten hor&s;es, ten oxen, and &s;ix
cows: they will con&s;ume 128 &s;tone a-day. If the
clover be at any di&s;tance, that quantity requires a
cart going continually from morning till evening.
Computing a cart at three &s;hillings per day, the
expence for the &s;ix &s;ummer-months is no le&s;s than
L. 25, 4 s. Even this high expence, is far from
counterbalancing the advantage of feeding cattle
in the hou&s;e. The expence, however, is &s;o con&s;i|derable,
<PB N="165" REF="191">
as to make it of importance to le&s;&s;en it.
In that view, I recommend the following plan, the
purpo&s;e of which is, to carry cattle to their food,
in&s;tead of carrying food to the cattle. Erect a
moveable &s;hed in the field, all of wood, the back
con&s;iderably higher than the front, in order to
have a &s;loping roof again&s;t rain. Sixteen feet in
widene&s;s is &s;ufficient for a bea&s;t of any &s;ize; the
length corre&s;ponding to the number of cattle that
are to be fed. On the back at the heads of the
cattle, a deal is hung with hinges, to be lifted up
for throwing food to them. Upon the ground a|long
the length of the hou&s;e, three beams are laid,
cro&s;&s;ed with &s;pars an inch di&s;tant from each other.
The channel or gutter behind the cattle, is lined
with a deal in the bottom, and one on each &s;ide,
to convey the pi&s;s from the cattle to a pit filled
with rich earth; which I hold to be preferable
even to dung it&s;elf. The three beams covered
with &s;pars make a vacuity below, which receives
the pi&s;s at the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and pre&s;erves the
cattle dry. This is an important article in feeding
cattle, which every animal at liberty is fond to
procure to it&s;elf. There is no nece&s;&s;ity for hecks
in this &s;hed; on the contrary, hor&s;es eat more
conveniently in the natural way, by bending down
the neck to food. The only thing nece&s;&s;ary is a
board between their fore feet and the clover, to
&s;ave it from being trampled under foot. It is
proper that in a corner a bed be erected for a
<PB N="166" REF="192">
&s;ervant, to attend the cattle during night. The
deals of this &s;hade mu&s;t be held together with
wooden nails, &s;o as ea&s;ily to be taken down, and
&s;et up again where it may be wanted. It &s;hould
be placed at the lowe&s;t part of the field; becau&s;e
the clover is more weighty, than the dung it produ|ces.
It is po&s;&s;ible to &s;et a little &s;hed on wheels, to
be carried from place to place, without being taken
down; but that will never an&s;wer for a &s;hed of
thirty or forty yards long. Such a &s;hed is proper
in every farm, where red clover is annually rai&s;ed
in the cour&s;e of cropping; and the expence will
be the le&s;s grudged, con&s;idering that it al&s;o an|&s;wers
for con&s;uming turnip and cabbage in win|ter.
Let the expence be computed of carrying
the&s;e to an immoveable &s;hed; and in a farm of
any extent, it will be found that the expence thus
&s;aved, even in a &s;ingle year, will equal the co&s;t of
the propo&s;ed &s;hed. In a &s;mall farm, where red
clover enters not into the rotation of crops, and
yet is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ummer-feeding; the mo&s;t
convenient way is, to inclo&s;e fix or &s;even acres as
near as may be to the farm-offices, upon a part
of which there always may be a crop of red clo|ver
in rotation. In that ca&s;e the carriage is a
tri&s;le. I have only to add, that room &s;hould not
be &s;pared; for hor&s;es are hurt as much as horn|ed
cattle by being crowded.</P>
<P>The proper &s;ea&s;ons for di&s;po&s;ing of cattle fatted
on gra&s;s, are the June markets, and tho&s;e of De|cember
<PB N="167" REF="193">
and January. With a view to the fir&s;t,
early gra&s;s ought to be provided, and late gra&s;s
with a view to the others. In an open winter,
there is no difficulty to pre&s;erve gra&s;s-cattle
fat through December and January: in a hard
winter, the addition of a little hay will do.</P>
<P>Next in order is the feeding cattle in a pa&s;ture-field.
White clover is for pa&s;ture the be&s;t gra&s;s
known in Britain, being extremely palatable to
cattle of every kind. Being a native of Britain,
it propagates it&s;elf by &s;preading along the &s;urface,
and taking root at every joint. But as this is a
work of time, it is more profitable to &s;tock the field
with it at once: thirty pounds of &s;eed are no more
than &s;ufficient for an acre. Good &s;eed is weighty,
and full, without dimples: it is red when hurt
in drying. A field intended for pa&s;ture, requires
a mixture of gra&s;&s;es: every &s;pecies has its favou|rite
gra&s;s; and when animals of different kinds
feed together, not a &s;ingle &s;tump is left. Differ|ent
gra&s;&s;es al&s;o, having different times of flowering,
keep the chain of food more complete during the
&s;ea&s;on. Ryegra&s;s for example an&s;wers for &s;pring-food
better than any other plant, and continues
longer after autumn. But white clover during
&s;ummer holds out better than ryegra&s;s. Different
gra&s;&s;es at the &s;ame time excite the appetite: an
ox will leave turnip for cabbage; and after feed|ing
plentifully on both, will take kindly to hay
or &s;traw. The proper quantity of &s;eed to an acre
<PB N="168" REF="194">
intended for immediate pa&s;ture, is ten pounds
white clover, five pounds yellow clover, as much
ribbed gra&s;s, and two wheat-firlots of ryegra&s;s.</P>
<P>A field proper for pa&s;ture, ought to have the
following properties. It ought to be well aired.
Second, well watered. Third, well &s;heltered.
Fourth, the larger the better. And, la&s;tly, the
gra&s;s ought to be &s;o rank as to afford a full bite.
With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, a field well aired makes
cattle feed kindly: in a hot day, they go to the
highe&s;t part for fre&s;h air: if they have neither
fre&s;h air nor water to re&s;ort to, they fret, and lo&s;e
fle&s;h. The want however may be &s;upplied artifi|cially,
by clumps of trees &s;cattered through the
field, to &s;helter them from the &s;un. With re&s;pect
to the &s;econd, plenty of water for drinking is not
alone &s;ufficient: there ought to be plenty for bath|ing
in a hot day: cattle are never more at ea&s;e
in &s;uch a day, than when they are plunged in wa|ter.
With re&s;pect to the third, it is not &s;ufficient
that cattle be &s;heltered again&s;t heat: &s;helter a|gain&s;t
cold is &s;till more nece&s;&s;ary. By proper
management, the chain of gra&s;s may be carried
on in tolerable weather till the end of the year;
but unle&s;s the cattle be protected from cold bla&s;ts,
gra&s;s will do them little good. The clumps men|tioned
planted in the form of a cro&s;s, will afford
&s;helter from whatever quarter the &s;torm comes.
With regard to the fourth, the field ought to be
&s;o large as to give cattle their natural range. E|very
<PB N="169" REF="195">
&s;pecies of animals that feed on gra&s;s have a
natural range in feeding; and to con&s;ine them
within narrower bounds, is to them a &s;ort of im|pri&s;onment.
Sheep have a wide range; and ought
to have, becau&s;e they delight in &s;hort gra&s;s: give
them eighty or ninety acres, and any fence will
keep them in: con&s;ine them to a field of &s;even or
eight acres, and it mu&s;t be a very &s;trong fence
that keeps them in. A range of fifty or &s;ixty
acres is &s;ufficient for hor&s;es; and a &s;till narrower
range for horned cattle. In oppo&s;ition to the field
de&s;cribed, advert to cattle cooped up in a &s;mall
inclo&s;ure of eight or nine acres, &s;urrounded with
high hedges. In &s;ummer they are &s;tifled for want
of air, are pe&s;tered with in&s;ects, and lo&s;e fat in|&s;tead
of gaining. To examine the progre&s;s of
fattening, I weighed twenty &s;tots the fir&s;t day of
May and the fir&s;t day of the five &s;ucceeding
months. Their quicke&s;t advance was in May and
September, being at an average two pounds daily
each. I could not attribute this to any other
cau&s;e, but to le&s;s heat and fewer in&s;ects than in
the three intermediate months. With re&s;pect to
the property la&s;t in order, the benefit of a full
bite is too obvious to need explanation.</P>
<P>A pa&s;ture-field bare of gra&s;s in &s;pring, having
no protection again&s;t withering winds, turns hard
and unfit for vegetation, e&s;pecially after wet wea|ther.
But where a field &s;prings early, and is co|vered
with gra&s;s before drought &s;ets in, it con|tinues
<PB N="170" REF="196">
moi&s;t and tender, by retaining dew and
keeping out drought. To encourage early gra&s;s
in &s;pring, the field ought to be left rough in win|ter;
which al&s;o keeps the ground warm, and pro|tects
the roots from fro&s;t.</P>
<P>Ragwort is a trouble&s;ome gue&s;t, as it never
fails to infe&s;t rich pa&s;ture-fields: it is not only a
robber, but over&s;hadows the gra&s;s, and renders it
unwhole&s;ome. I am at a lo&s;s however whether to
call it a weed or an u&s;eful plant. As it bears no
&s;eed till the third year of its growth, it cannot
propagate in land under tillage: in pa&s;ture-land, it
dies indeed after dropping its &s;eed, but new plants
&s;pring from that &s;eed, and have a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion with|out
end. Many things in appearance noxious,
have been found u&s;eful; of which this plant is an
in&s;tance. The &s;ame means will prevent its no|xious
effects, and make it profitable. Ragwort
in flower was never &s;een in a field pa&s;tured with
&s;heep. Why? becau&s;e that animal is exce&s;&s;ively
&s;ond of it. Therefore, in every pa&s;ture-field, for
&s;ome years after it is laid down, there ought to
be a proportion of &s;heep. They prefer ragwort
before any other vegetable; and experience pro|nounces,
that every food is whole&s;ome which an
animal is fond of. Lincoln&s;hire &s;heep do be&s;t;
becau&s;e a fence &s;ufficient for horned cattle,
is more than &s;ufficient for them. Sheep are
&s;ingular with re&s;pect al&s;o to other food. They
<PB N="171" REF="197">
are fond of the tender &s;hoots of broom and whins;
and no le&s;s &s;o of the fruit of the hor&s;e-che&s;nut.</P>
<P>The ru&s;h may be compared to ragwort: it is a
trouble&s;ome weed; and yet may be made in &s;ome
degree profitable. Whether it &s;hould be cla&s;&s;ed
among the evergreens, appears doubtful from the
following account of it. It &s;prings &s;ix or &s;even
inches high in April, grows on till Augu&s;t, when
the &s;eed appears at the &s;ide of the &s;tem, five or
&s;ix inches below the top. While the &s;eed is draw|ing
toward maturity, the part above withers gra|dually;
and when the &s;eed ripens and falls, the part
below withers down till within a foot or &s;o of the
ground. That part continues green all winter,
but dies away before next &s;ummer. In place of
the &s;tems that thus die, fre&s;h &s;tems ari&s;e, which,
as ob&s;erved above, make a figure in April. Whe|ther
the&s;e &s;tems ari&s;e from &s;eed, or from the
bulky root, or from both, I cannot at pre&s;ent de|termine.</P>
<P>As the ru&s;h is an aquatic, and grows &s;o vigo|rou&s;ly
as to de&s;troy all other plants, it ought to be
rooted out if po&s;&s;ible; not only becau&s;e it is a bad
pa&s;ture-gra&s;s, but becau&s;e the infallible way of
rooting it out is, to lay the ground dry; which
makes a double improvement. But if this cannot
be got done at a moderate expence, the re&s;ource
is, to make all the profit of it that is po&s;&s;ible.
If cut in June while young and tender, and dried
into hay, ru&s;hes make tolerable winter-food: a fre&s;h
<PB N="172" REF="198">
growth en&s;ues which is proof again&s;t fro&s;t, and is
not un&s;avoury to cattle that run out all winter.</P>
<P>In the month of April, while gra&s;s is &s;till &s;o
&s;hort as not to afford a bite to horned cattle, I
have &s;een fourteen cows living on ru&s;hes. At
that &s;ea&s;on, they are to horned cattle almo&s;t as pa|latable
as red clover. They are rejected when
old; and &s;o is even red clover.</P>
<P>A &s;prat is not an evergreen, for it dies away in
winter. It is an aquatic, like a ru&s;h, but thrives
with a le&s;s degree of moi&s;ture. It may be of &s;ome
u&s;e for hay when cut in June; and the after
growth is not unpalatable when eat young. But
after &s;eeding no bea&s;t will touch it.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>2. DRY FOOD.</HEAD>
<P>I proceed now to dry food. As hay is of u&s;e
to cattle of every kind, it is a capital object in
hu&s;bandry; and not the le&s;s capital, that in my
thought it may be carried to greater perfection
than is commonly done. To give &s;atisfaction, we
mu&s;t enter into an examination of the different
gra&s;&s;es that are u&s;ed for making hay. Red clover
is a &s;ucculent plant, of the leguminous tribe, that
flowers about the beginning of June, and ri&s;es to
the height of between three and four feet. Rye|gra&s;s
is a culmiferous plant, dry and &s;olid, like o|ther
plants of that tribe; ri&s;ing commonly in good
&s;oil to four feet, or nearly &s;o. It &s;hoots the end
<PB N="173" REF="199">
of April or beginning of May; and above all o|ther
plants ha&s;tens to perfect its &s;eed. Yellow
clover and ribwort, both of them leguminous
plants, are more tender and &s;ucculent than rye|gra&s;s;
but le&s;s &s;o than red clover: they ri&s;e com|monly
to between three and four feet. They
&s;hoot at the &s;ame time with ryegra&s;s, but perfect
their &s;eed not altogether &s;o &s;oon. Ryegra&s;s, be|cau&s;e
of its &s;olidity, is of all the be&s;t food for
hor&s;es; and next to it, yellow clover and ribwort.
Horned cattle delight in leguminous plants, red
clover e&s;pecially: it is probable that tender gra&s;&s;es
are fitte&s;t for animals that chew the cud. White
clover blooms and perfects its &s;eed at the &s;ame
time with red clover: it makes excellent dry food
for &s;heep; but as it &s;eldom ri&s;es above eighteen
inches, it is le&s;s proper for hay than any of the o|thers
mentioned; and upon that account, is often
left out in the mixture of gra&s;&s;es for hay.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the time of endurance, red
clover cannot be depended on for hay longer than
two years: the third year, it makes at be&s;t a
&s;canty crop, and frequently vani&s;hes altogether.
Ryegra&s;s, ribwort, and yellow clover, &s;tand good
three years. From that time, the product le&s;&s;ens
gradually; and after the &s;eventh or eighth year
they afford little pa&s;ture.</P>
<P>The general practice of Britain has been, to
mix for hay, ryegra&s;s and red clover with a
&s;mall proportion of white clover; which I be|lieve
continues to be the practice in many places.
<PB N="174" REF="200">
I cannot help condemning it, as the child of igno|rance
or inattention. Two weighty objections
occur. The fir&s;t is, that when the red clover is fit
to be cut for hay, which is about the beginning
of July, the ryegra&s;s-&s;eed is ripe. And what fol|lows?
the ryegra&s;s that year grows no more han
barley or wheat cut when the &s;eed is ripe;
whereas if ryegra&s;s be cut before the &s;eed is form|ed,
it grows all &s;ummer, and even all winter, till
it makes way for new &s;hoots in &s;pring. It may
po&s;&s;ibly be thought, that the &s;eed, like that of o|ther
culmiferous plants, is more than &s;ufficient to
make up the &s;eantine&s;s of &s;ub&s;equent cuttings;
but in drying for hay, mo&s;t of it is lo&s;t, &s;ome in
the field, &s;ome in the &s;tack, and &s;ome in the hay-loft;
little being left but the dry &s;traw, which
cattle do not willingly eat. The other objection
is of &s;till greater weight. After a crop or two of
hay, the field is &s;urrendered to pa&s;ture. The red
clover wears out the &s;econd year, leaving nothing
but the ryegra&s;s, which continues but another year
in perfection: and the &s;mall proportion of white
clover has not yet got time to &s;pread over the
field. Thus, after the &s;econd year, the pa&s;ture
is but indifferent; and turns wor&s;e and wor&s;e un|le&s;s
the field happen to &s;tock it&s;elf with natural
gra&s;&s;es. Nor is that all: while the field is but
half-&s;tocked with &s;own gra&s;&s;es, weeds take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of the yacuities, and accelerate the dwarfing
of the ryegra&s;s white clover. And if the red
<PB N="175" REF="201">
clover happen to be a &s;canty crop the &s;econd year,
it encourages weeds no le&s;s than a &s;canty crop of
pea&s;e.</P>
<P>I venture to &s;ugge&s;t a better plan for hay than
any I have read of. I pronounce the be&s;t hay for
hor&s;es to be a mixture of ryegra&s;s and yellow clo|ver,
which flower together, and are fit to be cut
for hay the beginning of June, when &s;till in
flower and the &s;eed not formed: at that time, be|ing
full of &s;ap, they, are in perfection for hay.
When cut &s;o early, they grow again vigorou&s;ly,
and afford a &s;econd crop end of September; or
excellent pa&s;ture, if the &s;ea&s;on be unfavourable
for hay. When the fir&s;t cutting is later than be|ginning
of June, the &s;tem turns dry and woody;
and much of it is rejected, if a hor&s;e be not ex|tremely
hungry. But I recommend this to gen|tlemen
only and farmers, for feeding their own
hor&s;es. In the view to &s;ell hay, their profit I ac|knowledge
will be greater in cutting when the &s;eed
is ripe, becau&s;e the &s;eed is a profitable article.
The hay, it is true, &s;eparate from the &s;eed, is no
better than &s;traw: but that is no objection to a
&s;tabler; for the le&s;s hay a travelling hor&s;e con|&s;umes,
his profit is the greater. My rea&s;on for
chu&s;ing the&s;e two plants for hay to hor&s;es is, that,
of all leguminous plants, yellow clover approaches
the neare&s;t in &s;olidity to ryegra&s;s, and that they
dry well together. Ribwort is left out, as being
le&s;s fit for hor&s;es; and where plenty of &s;eed is
<PB N="176" REF="202">
given, the two plants cho&s;en will make as weighty
a crop as the ground can bear. Three wheat-fir|lots
of ryegra&s;s, and ten pounds of yellow clover,
make a &s;ufficient doze for an acre. And when
cut early, as it ought to be, the crop mu&s;t be
very weighty if the cutting co&s;t more than eigh|teen
pence per acre.</P>
<P>For hay to horned cattle, the mixture ought to
be red clover, yellow clover, and ribwort. Red
clover, it is true, falls properly to be cut a little
later than the other two; but as it is choice food
for horned cattle, it is better to &s;ubmit to a &s;mall|er
quantity, than to lo&s;e the foggage of the other
plants by cutting them too late. Ten pounds
red clover, as much ribwort, and four pounds
yellow clover, are &s;ufficient for an acre.</P>
<P>A farm hor&s;e during winter requires at lea&s;t
two lippies of oats daily in &s;pring, which affords
more working hours, they are encrea&s;ed $p there.
The re&s;t of his food is hay or &s;traw: bean-&s;traw
is the be&s;t, pea&s;e-&s;traw next, and after it good
oat-&s;traw. Upon that food, a pair of good hor|&s;es
will labour ten hours a-day, and plough an
acre of cultivated land; or draw on a &s;mooth road
a hundred &s;tone in a cart, &s;ixteen Engli&s;h miles.
Such work they can perform daily without lo&s;ing
fle&s;h.</P>
<P>When too much hay or corn is given to a hor&s;e
at once, he eats greedily, and is apt to &s;urfeit on
it. On this account, as well as to &s;ave food, bet|ter
<PB N="177" REF="203">
to give it in &s;mall parcels at intervals, in which
ca&s;e every particle will be eat up clean. Were it
not for the expence, the be&s;t way of feeding a
hor&s;e with hay would be, to give it out of the
hand. As for corn, a hor&s;e, when hungry, is apt
to &s;wallow it without chewing; in which ca&s;e it
pa&s;&s;es entire without affording nouri&s;hment.
Therefore with oats mix chaff or cut &s;traw, which
require chewing. If that labour be grudged,
there is an in&s;trument contrived for brui&s;ing oats,
which has a promi&s;ing appearance. I will not,
however, venture to recommend it, becau&s;e I
have not experienced it.</P>
<P>A dairy may be turned to great account. A
good cow, during the &s;ix &s;ummer-months, will
give at a medium twelve Scotch pints of milk
daily; the butter of which, with the &s;kimmed
milk, may amount to eighteen pence per day, and
thirteen pounds ten &s;hillings in the &s;ix months.
The gra&s;ing of &s;uch a cow for that time will not
co&s;t above forty &s;hillings, which makes eleven
pounds ten &s;hillings of profit.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>3. FEEDING FOR THE BUTCHER.</HEAD>
<P>HORNED cattle continue to grow till they are
full &s;ix years old; during which time they do not
readily take on fat, nor carry much tallow. The
proper time to enter them upon fattening food, is
at the age of &s;even. There is an additional rea|&s;on,
<PB N="178" REF="204">
that three years work can be got from them,
which in all events will do more than balance the
expence of their food.</P>
<P>As the demand for butcher-meat in Scotland
increa&s;es rapidly, the feeding cattle for the &s;ham|bles
has become an intere&s;ting article to the far|mer.
Thirty years ago, he had no temptation to
keep fat on his cattle during winter, becau&s;e there
was nothing but &s;alt meat during winter and
&s;pring. We have now fre&s;h meat in plenty, all the
year round; only a little dearer in &s;pring; and of
that circum&s;tance a provident farmer will avail
him&s;elf. The difference of a month, will &s;ome|times
add a halfpenny to every pound of beef;
which, upon an ox of &s;ixty &s;tone, makes forty
&s;hillings for that month's feeding.</P>
<P>A field &s;own with the gra&s;&s;es above mentioned,
may be depended on for fattening from the middle
of April, in a warm &s;oil, till the middle of No|vember:
nor will they fall off till the middle of
December, if fro&s;t and &s;now keep away. Hay,
though greatly preferable to &s;traw of any kind,
yet will not fatten horned cattle for the market
without green food. It indeed keeps the fat up|on
them; but adds little or none. It is however
profitable to feed a fat ox with hay during win|ter;
becau&s;e the additional price got in the &s;pring,
will defray the expence of the hay. Some years
ago, I fed twelve oxen with hay through winter;
and though they were not a pound heavier in A|pril,
<PB N="179" REF="205">
I &s;old them at that time for double the &s;um
I paid for them. An ox of a middling &s;ize, eats
thirty pounds of hay, Dutch weight, in twenty-four
hours, and drinks forty-eight Scotch pints
of water. An ox of a large &s;ize will eat forty
pounds, and will drink in proportion.</P>
<P>Of all the bea&s;ts I know, a &s;paved quey is the
mo&s;t profitable both for labour and for the butch|er.
She is little inferior to an ox in &s;trength; but
much more agile, and con&s;equently better fitted
for travel. She will work even till eight years
old, and &s;till be fit for feeding fat. People of
delicate ta&s;te prefer that &s;ort of beef.</P>
<P>It is a great lo&s;s to have a cow to maintain that
has mi&s;&s;ed calf. The only profit is to feed her
for the butcher. She feeds the fa&s;ter after ha|ving
received the bull. But care mu&s;t be taken
not to admit the bull, but &s;o as that &s;he may be
&s;old fat three months before the time of calving;
for during the&s;e three months &s;he commonly lo&s;es
fat.</P>
<P>Con&s;iderable profit may be made by feeding
&s;mall cattle bred in the Highlands, purcha&s;ed
when four years old at a &s;mall price, becau&s;e they
are unfit for work. This branch of commerce is
accordingly well under&s;tood.</P>
<P>A &s;ow is a profitable animal: it feeds greedily
on cut clover; which, with the offals of the kit|chen,
dairy, and barn, prepare it finely for being
fatted in a &s;hort time with more nouri&s;hing food.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="206">
The feeding of calves for veal is al&s;o profitable.
The calf even of a middle-&s;ized cow, after &s;ucking
her for &s;ix weeks, will &s;ell at a guinea. The
&s;ame cow will in &s;ix months feed four calves for
the butcher, &s;ometimes more; and after all, will
give milk two months longer. For making fine
veal, the calf ought to be blooded frequently,
kept from light, laid clean and dry, and get chalk
to lick.</P>
<P>For &s;ome years pa&s;t, a &s;hed erected upon pillars,
with intervals of eight or ten feet, has been u&s;ed
for &s;tall-feeding. Such a &s;hed I pronounce to be
too cold for our climate. A hou&s;e &s;o con&s;tructed,
as to avoid the extremities of heat and cold, an|&s;wers
much better. Upon a feed of turnip in
hard fro&s;t, cattle may be ob&s;erved to contract
their feet together, and to tremble as in an ague.
No animal can feed well in di&s;tre&s;s. On the o|ther
hand, cattle in a clo&s;e hou&s;e, and in a hot
day, may be ob&s;erved panting for want of breath.
Therefore let the feeding-hou&s;e have many win|dows
or air-holes, to be &s;hut or opened as occa|&s;ion
requires.</P>
<P>As to the time of hou&s;ing cattle for feeding, it
is evident, that as gra&s;s is more ea&s;ily rai&s;ed than
cabbage or turnip, the longer &s;tall-feeding is de|layed
without lo&s;ing fat, the better for the farmer.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the food proper for &s;tall-feed|ing,
turnip, cabbage, colewort, potatoes, carrot,
are all proper, and may be rai&s;ed in every farm.
<PB N="181" REF="207">
For feeding in perfection, all of them ought to be
provided; for which there is more than one rea|&s;on.
In the fir&s;t place, variety excites the appe|tite:
next, &s;ome of the&s;e vegetables endure the
winter better than others: turnip, for example,
does not an&s;wer for &s;pring-food, &s;o well as cabbage
and colewort. Therefore, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent
with variety, I would be &s;paring of the vegetables
that are the lea&s;t hurt by winter. Potatoes an|&s;wer
be&s;t for the concluding food. If &s;ufficient
&s;tore be provided, and well pre&s;erved, which is an
ea&s;y matter, all complaints of wanting green food
in &s;pring mu&s;t be at an end. Every animal is
fond of potatoes, not even excepting a hor&s;e.
They are a choice food for milk-cows, and pro|duce
plenty of milk; which has no rank ta&s;te
more than where fed on hay or gra&s;s. And
yet after all, how many indolent farmers &s;till
remain, who for want of &s;pring-food are forced to
turn their cattle out to gra&s;s, before it is ready for
pa&s;ture; which not only &s;tarves the cattle, but
lays the gra&s;s-roots open to be parched by &s;un
and wind. One precaution, however, is nece&s;&s;ary
with re&s;pect to gra&s;s in proper condition for pa|&s;ture
&s;urrender is not to the cattle at once, which
would give a loo&s;ene&s;s, but for a few days let
them feed an hour or two only.</P>
<P>Preparatory to the feeding cattle in the hou&s;e
with cabbage and turnip, they ought to be made
acquainted with that food in the field, by getting
<PB N="182" REF="208">
now and then &s;mall feeds of it; beginning with
cabbage, which they &s;oon take to as being &s;oft,
and then proceeding to turnip. Without being
thus prepared, &s;ome bea&s;ts have been known to
fa&s;t ob&s;tinately for days, before they would touch
them. In the hou&s;e, it is common to fill the &s;talls
at once for &s;aving trouble. This is wrong: cat|tle
are &s;o fond of cabbage and turnip after ac|quaintance,
as to be apt to &s;urfeit upon them. A
hungry hor&s;e, by eating too much corn at a time,
takes a loathing of that food; and his loathing
continues for days. Begin with giving a bullock
one turnip after another, and he will not readily
&s;urfeit. One bullock of ninety &s;tone Dutch thus
fed, ate up thirteen Dutch &s;tone before he &s;top|ped;
and in twenty-four hours he devoured thir|ty
&s;tone. This was the third part of his own
weight; and every bullock in health will do the
&s;ame, when thus fed. Therefore, after cleaning
the turnip, let the feeder begin in the morning
with throwing a turnip or two to every bullock,
one after another: let him repeat the do&s;e till
they turn &s;hy: let him then give them cabbage in
the &s;ame manner; and conclude with handfuls of
hay. When they are thus &s;atisfied, prepare them
a &s;oft bed as an invitaion to lie down. Leave
them to chew the cud and &s;leep, till they ri&s;e of
their own accord. Repeat the do&s;e as before,
As they grow fat, they will reject the coar&s;er
parts of the food; which may be given to win|terers,
<PB N="183" REF="209">
or to &s;wine. If the turnip be large, there
is no danger of giving them whole. But they are
apt to choke upon &s;mall turnip; which therefore
mu&s;t be cut into &s;mall bits that can be ea&s;ily &s;wal|lowed.
A machine to brui&s;e turnip for eating
would be a u&s;eful invention.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;tructions are calculated to make cattle
eat the greate&s;t quantity po&s;&s;ible; it being certain,
that the more a bullock eats with an appetite, the
&s;ooner he grows fat. It is bad oeconomy to &s;pare
food in this ca&s;e: a certain quantity daily is re|qui&s;ite
to pre&s;erve a bea&s;t from falling away; and
an addition is nece&s;&s;ary to put fat on him. There|fore
the &s;ooner he is fatted, the greater propor|tion
of what is nece&s;&s;ary for bare maintenance, is
&s;aved.</P>
<P>To keep cattle clean, and well littered, is to
them half food; and this may be ea&s;liy done in a
&s;hed con&s;tructed as de&s;cribed above. Let them
be combed every day, wa&s;hed with water every
week, and bled every month; for the&s;e all con|tribute
to fattening.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the cattle in this country &s;old to the
butcher, are fed upon gra&s;s, and &s;old in Novem|ber
at two pence per pound, or two pence half-penny.
But as the profit here is very &s;mall, a
farmer who is &s;tudious of his intere&s;t, will have a
provi&s;ion of cabbage and turnip for winter, in
order to &s;ell his cattle at double price in &s;pring.</P>
<P>It has become a pretty general practice, to feed
<PB N="184" REF="210">
cattle in the field with turnip, cabbage, and other
annual greens. There is not another way of fat|tening
cattle &s;o cheap; nor another way by which
&s;o much dung can be rai&s;ed in a farm. The&s;e
are important objects. But what I chiefly in&s;i&s;t
on is, that there is not within the invention of
man, a more effectual method for improving a
gravelly or &s;andy &s;oil. Nothing indeed is more
hurtful to clay or rank loam than poaching; but
the poaching a light &s;oil takes away the pores,
makes the earth more compact, and more reten|tive
of moi&s;ture. A crop of turnip or cabbage
on &s;tiff land, ought not to be fed in the field; but
in a &s;hed, &s;uch as above de&s;cribed, or in an ad|jacent
dry field.</P>
<P>To be &s;ucce&s;sful in this article, let cattle be
cho&s;en that have been accu&s;tomed to run out in
winter. Cattle that have been always hou&s;ed in
winter, are too tender for field-feeding: they will
never turn fat.</P>
<P>There requires more management in feeding
cattle with cabbage and turnip, in the field, than
is commonly practi&s;ed. What mu&s;t one think of
the &s;lovently method of turning cattle into a tur|nip-field,
to feed at random? I hope this is rare;
but another method is not rare, which is, to in|clo&s;e
with flakes a portion of the field, and with|in
that &s;mall &s;pace to confine the cattle. Is it not
obvious, that by dunging, pi&s;&s;ng, trampling, $
great part of the turnip mu&s;t be lo&s;t, or become

nau&s;eous? To prevent that lo&s;s, I have always
practi&s;ed the following method. Suppo&s;ing the
inclo&s;ure to be an oblong &s;quare, which is the
mo&s;t convenient for flakes, begin at one of the
&s;hort &s;ides, and from the fence throw the turnip
towards the middle of the field, clearing as much
ground as can be done at one throw, which may
be thirteen or fourteen feet. Separate this vacant
&s;pace from the turnip by flakes. Let the flakes
incline inward to the field, which will prevent the
cattle from rubbing them down. Introduce the
cattle into this void &s;pace, and begin with throw|ing
over to them, from time to time, the turnip
that were taken up, &s;o &s;paringly that they may
eat without trampling them under foot. After
the&s;e are clean eat up, clear another &s;trip of the
&s;ame breadth with the former, by throwing over
to the cattle $word$ that growth $word$. Remove
the flakes to $word$ of the growing turnip, and
go on till the field be eat up. In this manner the
whole field with $word$ $n$ad and poached, &s;o as total|ly
to alter the texture of the &s;oil. But becau&s;e to
give the cattle no other bed, would greatyy retard
the progre$$ of fattening; an adjacent gra&s;s-field is
nece&s;&s;ary, in which they &s;hould $e put every
night for a day bed. In this gra&s;s-field place
heck$ for feeding the cattle with hay or &s;traw;
as nothing contributes more to expeditious fat|ning,
than alternate green and dry food.</P>
<P>Fro&s;t is the only enemy to this manner of feed|ing.
<PB N="186" REF="212">
In fro&s;t, the digging up the turnip is expen|&s;ive;
and they give the cattle a loo&s;ene&s;s, which
makes them lean in&s;tead of fat. Hard fro&s;t de|&s;troys
the turnip altogether. I have tried &s;everal
preventives. At the corner of a field, I built in
a &s;tack all the turnip that grew on four acres.
They remained entire &s;ix weeks; but after that
time, they began to &s;prout, e&s;pecially about the
centre, which exhau&s;ted the turnip, and rendered
them le&s;s palatable. I tried another method;
which was, to fill a large hou&s;e with turnip, on the
fir&s;t appearance of fro&s;t. The warmth of the
hou&s;e made them &s;prout &s;ooner than in the for|mer
way. I made a third experiment; which
was, to dig a pit in the field &s;ix or &s;even feet deep,
where I &s;towed the turnip and covered them with
three feet of earth, reckoning that this would
prevent vegetation. But they &s;prouted as &s;oon as
in the hou&s;e. A fourth experiment was, to build
in the field what would fill two large carts, co|vering
the heap with ferns or &s;traw. In this &s;i|tuation,
they were longer of &s;prouting; but they
were more expo&s;ed to fro&s;t. Upon the whole,
the be&s;t method, as appears to me, is to &s;tore up
in a hou&s;e as many turnip as will &s;erve the cattle
a fortnight. Becau&s;e after that time they begin to
wither, give them to the cattle though the wea|ther
be fre&s;h; and then fill the hou&s;e again. This
is a re&s;ource again&s;t a fortnight's fro&s;t; and as a
farther re&s;ource, a few heaps may be collected in
<PB N="187" REF="213">
the field, ready at hand if fro&s;t &s;et in. The &s;ame
method may be taken with cabbage. Carrots
are pre&s;erved by taking them up, and burying
them in &s;and. Potatoes being more hurt by fro&s;t
than any other root, they ought to be &s;tored up
in a hou&s;e, and covered with dry &s;traw pre&s;&s;ed
down with litter. But here a precaution is nece&s;|&s;ary.
If allowed to lie too long in their winter|quarters,
they will &s;prout, and be u&s;ele&s;s. There|fore,
as &s;oon as the fro&s;t is over in &s;pring, they
mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to the &s;un and air till perfectly
dry; and then laid up where there is a free cir|culation
of air.</P>
<P>Cabbage and turnip give a &s;trong ta&s;te to but|cher-meat,
e&s;pecially when not intermixed with
dry food. But the remedy is ea&s;y: give nothing
but dry food for a few days before they are de|livered
to the butcher. The intermixing dry food
with turnip and cabbage in feeding milk-cows,
ought never to be omitted; becau&s;e the&s;e plants
alone give a nau&s;eous ta&s;te to the milk, cream,
and butter.</P>
<P>The feeding cattle with turnip and cabbage in
the field, is an intere&s;ting article. There are few
farms but what are fit for rai&s;ing green food of
one kind or other; and by far the greater part
are fit for every kind. Light &s;oil is fit for turnip,
both light and loamy &s;oil for potatoes, deep &s;oil
for carrots, and &s;tong &s;oil for cabbage. For a
dozen of years back, the ordinary profit of &s;uch
<PB N="188" REF="214">
feeding from the end of November to the end
of March, has been to double the price of the
cattle; which affords a very hand&s;ome rent for
the land. Nor do I reckon this the capital part:
the gain is &s;till greater by the improvement of the
&s;oil. No other method is &s;o effectual to convert
light porous &s;oil into what is firm and heavy, than
the poaching of cattle during winter. To compare
it with a manure that is exhau&s;ted by cropping,
would not do it ju&s;tice. It alters and improves
the &s;oil like clay-marl; and the&s;e two are the
only means I am acquainted with, to produce a
new &s;oil equal to one originally rich. There are
few &s;oils indeed but what may be hurt by crop|ping;
but a &s;oil &s;o improved, can never be hurt
&s;o much by cropping, as to be reduced to its ori|ginal
poor &s;tate. After &s;uch a winter-feeding, it
would &s;urpri&s;e one, to find ground formerly &s;o loo&s;e
as not to hold together, become now &s;o &s;olid as
to be rai&s;ed by the plough in &s;olid ma&s;&s;es. This
way of feeding cattle, is at the &s;ame time a good
dunging to the field, equal at lea&s;t to an ordi|nary
dunging from a dunghill. The cattle eva|cuate
abundantly, and what drops from them
mixes intimately with the &s;oil: not a particle is
lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The feeding &s;heep on turnip and cabbage ought
to be delayed as long as po&s;&s;ible, for the rea&s;on
given above with re&s;pect to horned cattle. But
as &s;heep are better protected again&s;t cold, there
<PB N="189" REF="215">
is the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ity of providing a &s;hed for them.
To &s;ave the turnip, flakes ought to be u&s;ed; and
a dry bed is &s;till more nece&s;&s;ary to them than to
horned cattle. Their dry food ought to be white-clover
hay, or unthre&s;hed fitches; both of which
they delight in. White-clover hay, however,
without corn or green food, will not fatten &s;heep
for the butcher. In fro&s;t and &s;now, &s;heep &s;hould
always be &s;upplied with hay or other dry food;
which prepares them for gree food the end of
March; at which time a few weeks of ryegra&s;s
will make them ready for the market, at the dear|e&s;t
time of the year.</P>
<P>Where &s;heep are fed in the hou&s;e, which is &s;el|dom
done except for the u&s;e of a family, they
ought to be &s;eparated by rails from each other;
otherwi&s;e the &s;tronge&s;t wedder will oppre&s;s the
re&s;t. They mu&s;t be &s;horn when put up to feed,
and be always kept clean. There mu&s;t be a neck
for holding hay, a place for the turnip or cabbage,
and a rip of oats be hung up within their reach.
A &s;heep, like an ox, eats of turnip the third of its
own weight in twenty-four hours. The be&s;t age
for feeding weathers is four or five: &s;hort of that
age they feed not &s;o kindly, nor tallow &s;o well.</P>
<P>Some land is fitted for feeding; &s;ome for breed|ing
only. A farmer who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es rich land, buys
lean cattle from the breeder, and fattens them for
the butcher.</P>

<HEAD>4. THE WINTERING OF CATTLE NOT IN|TENDED
FOR IMMEDIATE SALE.</HEAD>
<P>THE food proper for &s;uch cattle is, fir&s;t, coar&s;e
gra&s;s that they refu&s;e to eat during &s;ummer, when
they have better food. Second, &s;traw or coar&s;e
hay; and, la&s;t, what is left by milk-cows, by
bea&s;ts &s;tall-fed, or by working oxen and hor&s;es.
With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, the common but very
improper method is, to let them go at large in
the field; and in fro&s;t and &s;now to give them
food in hecks. By this method, the dung is al|mo&s;t
entirely lo&s;t, and unle&s;s the field happen to
be well &s;heltered, which &s;eldom is the ca&s;e, Scot|land
is a climate too cold for &s;uch management.
This is verified in our highland cattle, which ne|ver
arrive at half their &s;ize; not &s;o much from
want of food, as from piercing cold in a moun|tainous
country. To remedy both the&s;e evils, an
open &s;hed &s;hould be erected in the field, for &s;helter
to the cattle in a &s;torm; and this &s;hed &s;hould be
in the mo&s;t &s;heltered &s;pot, fronting the &s;outh. To
pre&s;erve the food given them during fro&s;t and
&s;now, a heck &s;hould be put up in the &s;hed; and
the dung be carefully collected from time to time.
It is evident from what is &s;aid, that no cattle are
fit to be managed in this manner, but what have
been accu&s;tomed to lie out all winter.</P>
<P>Where there is no coar&s;e gra&s;s for winter-feed|ing,
<PB N="191" REF="217">
the ordinary method to feed winterers is in
a dung-yard with &s;traw, the half of which, trod|den
down with the foot, turns to no account.
The more provident farmers &s;et up a heck in the
yard, which &s;aves &s;ome of the &s;traw that is lo&s;t
the other way.</P>
<P>This method, though common, lies open to
many objections: fir&s;t, it is &s;till too cold for win|ter;
next, much good food is de&s;troyed by it;
and, third, the dung, by trampling of the cattle,
is kept from rotting. This matter is intere&s;ting,
and I beg the reader's attention, while I endea|vour
to verify the&s;e propo&s;itions. With re&s;pect
to the fir&s;t, the &s;helter of a yard is far from being
&s;ufficient to pre&s;erve cattle in a kindly heat, du|ring
fro&s;ty weather. Such an inclo&s;ure is &s;ubject
to whirling winds, which pinch the cattle even in
fre&s;h weather. Ob&s;erve, that when cattle are
brought from a warmer climate to mend the
breed, every one is &s;en&s;ible, that during winter a
warm hou&s;e, and plenty of food, &s;hould be pro|vided
for them. A cow when thus treated gives
more milk, and a bea&s;t intended for the butcher
goes &s;ooner to fat. To an&s;wer the&s;e purpo&s;es, I
believe it will be found, that the nearer the air
approaches to the heat of the blood, the cattle
will thrive the better. That cattle fed in a yard
de&s;troy much &s;traw, is obvious to ocular in&s;pec|tion.
Even when &s;traw is put into a heck, one
be$&s;t no &s;ooner draws out a mouthful, than he is
<PB N="192" REF="218">
pu&s;hed away by another, and lo&s;es in his hurry
part of what he draws from the heck: none of
them are &s;uffered to feed peaceably or quietly.
The third propo&s;ition is the mo&s;t important of all.
Half-rotten dung trodden under foot, and knead|ed
together by the cattle, excludes the air totally
from the inner parts of the heap; and it is a truth
indi&s;putable, that there never can be any putre|faction
where there is no air. Putrefaction can|not
go on without moi&s;ture, and as little without
air. Put a &s;poonful of cream in an exhau&s;ted re|ceiver;
and after a year it will come out as
&s;weet as when put in. When a dunghill, after
heating, turns cool again, turn it over and admit
fre&s;h air, it heats a &s;econd time: a &s;take driven
into an open gravelly &s;oil, which admits air into
every pore, rots &s;ooner than even in a wet clay-&s;oil
that excludes air.</P>
<P>From the&s;e premi&s;&s;es I conclude with firmne&s;s,
that the be&s;t way of feeding winterers is in a
hou&s;e where there is free ventilation; indulging
them only an hour or two in the field when let
out to water, more or le&s;s according to the wea|ther.
I know many judicious farmers, who pre|fer
the feeding on a dunghill, with an open &s;hed
to retire to in a &s;torm; and they even hold, that
the treading of cattle on a dunghill contributes to
its putrefaction. I flatter my&s;elf that I have di&s;|covered
the rea&s;on of this opinion. The practice
is, to throw quantities of dry &s;traw from time to
<PB N="193" REF="219">
time on the dunghill, part of which is eaten by
the cattle, and the re&s;t trodden under foot.
Straw is ela&s;tic, and when laid on a dunghill dry,
it admits too much air; in which ca&s;e the dung|hill
gains by being trodden on. But where all
the &s;traw is u&s;ed, either in food or in litter,
and none of it carried to the dunghill till it be half
putrefied; it claps clo&s;e enough of it&s;elf; it be|comes
too compact by being trodden upon; and
the air is excluded altogether, which ob&s;tructs
putrefaction no le&s;s than too much air. A pro|vident
farmer will never wa&s;te his &s;traw, by throw|ing
it on a dunghill: he will provide as many
winterers, as to con&s;ume all the &s;traw that is to
&s;pare from his working cattle. I add, that &s;up|po&s;ing
winterers to be as comfortably put up in a
farm-yard as in a hou&s;e, the latter however ought
to be preferred; fir&s;t, becau&s;e it &s;aves &s;traw, and
the bea&s;ts are more regularly fed; next, that it
is a better way of having a dunghill well putre|fied;
and, la&s;tly, that the pi&s;s of the cattle can
be wholly pre&s;erved; whereas in a farm-yard all
is lo&s;t but what happens to fall on the dunghill.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>5. RULES FOR BUYING AND SELLING CAT|TLE
AND CORN.</HEAD>
<P>THE common and con&s;tant way is, to fell cattle by
the eye; which is far from being equal between
the farmer and the butcher. The former has but
<PB N="194" REF="220">
a very uncertain gue&s;s of the weight; the latter,
who is dealing the year round, can gue&s;s very
near. Fair commerce is in general the mo&s;t be|neficial;
and every thing that approaches to
chance or gaming is hurtful. To bring on a per|fect
equality between the &s;eller and buyer, I pro|po&s;e,
that every bea&s;t &s;hould be &s;old by weight,
and that the weight &s;hould be a&s;certained by a ba|lance.
The mo&s;t convenient one I know is a
&s;teel-yard, being the fitte&s;t for weighing heavy
goods; and a &s;teel-yard I have u&s;ed with ea&s;e and
&s;ucce&s;s many years.</P>
<P>But it is not &s;ufficient to have the weight of a
living bea&s;t a&s;certained. Different parts are very
different in their value; and there is a rule for
a&s;certaining the proportion of the&s;e different parts,
by which their weight may be known, almo&s;t
with equal certainty as the weight of the whole
bea&s;t. My experience goes no farther than to
Scotch cattle &s;old fat, to which the following
proportions will nearly an&s;wer. The four quar|ters
make the half of the weight of the bullock.
The &s;kin is the eighteenth part. The tallow the
twelfth part. The&s;e make twenty three thirty-&s;ixths
of the whole; and the head, feet, tripe,
blood, &amp;c. make the remainder, being a third
part and a little more. The&s;e offals never &s;ell by
weight, but at a certain proportion of the weight
of the bea&s;t. They commonly draw ten &s;hillings
<PB N="195" REF="221">
and &s;ixpence when the bullock weighs a hundred
&s;tone Dutch; and &s;o in proportion.</P>
<P>The&s;e particulars adju&s;ted, the next thing the
&s;eller is to inform him&s;elf of, is the price of but|cher-meat
in the market, of tallow, and of hides.
Suppo&s;ing the bullock I have to &s;ell is &s;eventy-two
&s;tone living weight, the four quarters make thir|ty-&s;ix
&s;tone, which at 4 s. per &s;tone, or 3 d. per
pound, amount to L. 7, 4 s. The hide is worth
16 s. at 4 s. per &s;tone; and the tallow, be|ing
5 s. 4 d. the &s;tone, is worth L. 1, 12 s.
Sterling. The offals, according to the proportion
above mentioned, will give 7 s. 6 d.; and by that
computation the value of the bullock is L. 9,
19 s. 6 d. This an&s;wers to 2 s. 9 9/12 d. per &s;tone
living weight. And therefore, if the butcher a|gree
to give me that &s;um per &s;tone, no more is
nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;certain the price of the whole car|go,
than to weigh the bea&s;ts by threes or fours as
the &s;cale can hold them. Out of this &s;um how|ever
mu&s;t be deducted the butcher's profit, which
cannot be much le&s;s than 5 per cent.</P>
<P>The weighing cattle alive an&s;wers another im|portant
purpo&s;e; which is, to di&s;cover whether
the feeder gets the value of the food by the ad|ditional
weight of the bea&s;t. For example, the
food of a bullock co&s;ts 9 d. per day, or 5 s. 3 d.
per week. If the bullock do not take on two
&s;tone per week, the keeper is a lo&s;er; and there
<PB N="196" REF="222">
is no excu&s;e for keeping the bea&s;t on hand, un|le&s;s
perhaps in expectation of a ri&s;ing market.</P>
<P>There is another advantage of regulating the
price of cattle by living weight. Where a but|cher
buys by the lump, and bargains that he is to
take away the bea&s;t at a day certain, the vender
is tempted to be &s;paring of food. But &s;uppo&s;ing
the bea&s;t to be &s;old by living weight, it is the in|tere&s;t
of the &s;eller to make it as fat as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The &s;ame rule in &s;elling is applicable to &s;heep.
The four quarters make half of the living weight,
the &s;kin the eleventh part, the tallow the tenth
part, the offals &s;omewhat le&s;s than the third
part. But computing the prices that the&s;e parti|culars
&s;ell for in the market, the amount will not
be the value of the &s;heep, becau&s;e the wool al&s;o
mu&s;t be taken under con&s;ideration. The wool
from &s;hearing-time to Lammas is of little value.
At the end of December the value is the half of a
full-grown fleece. A Linton, Ochill, or Lam|mermuir
wedder, at the age of four, carries a
fleece weighing at a medium two pounds eight
ounces, valued at 9 d. per pound when not tar|red,
which makes the value of a fleece at clip|ping-time,
1 s. 10 6/12 d. Sterling. At the end of
December it is 11 9/12 d.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>As the wool of &s;heep degenerates into hair in both ex$remes of heat and cold, &s;mearing is a remedy in a cold climate. It al&s;o kills vermin, and makes a &s;heep take on fat five or &s;ix weeks &s;ooner than it would do o|therwi&s;e. Some miles round Cheviot hills, none but &s;heep of a year old are &s;meared: elder &s;heep are reckon|ed &s;ufficiently &s;trong to endure the cold without it. But there black &s;heep of all ages are &s;meared, becau&s;e black wool is not di&s;coloured by &s;mearing. In the north of Scotland &s;mearing is not known.</P>
<P>Wool &s;horn immediately after a &s;heep is wa&s;hed, ne|ver turns white. A kind of oil, termed <HI>gleet,</HI> per&s;pires from the animal, and contributes to whiten the wool in &s;couring.

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> An animal weighs more or le&s;s as his bel|ly
is more or le&s;s full. The above proportions
were made out when the &s;heep and horned cattle

<P>HAVING di&s;cu&s;&s;ed cattle, I proceed to corn. The
variety of mea&s;ures in &s;elling and buying corn,
has been time out of mind a ju&s;t cau&s;e of com|plaint
in Scotland, as well as other countries; and
it is indeed an inlet to many frauds. And yet,
were all the mea&s;ures u&s;ed in Scotland reduced
to the Linlithgow &s;tandard, there would however
remain a great inconvenience in &s;elling grain by
mea&s;ure; for of all commodities, it is the lea&s;t
proper to be &s;old in that manner. The quality of
grain differs widely in different &s;oils, and even in
the &s;ame &s;oil by good or bad culture. One boll
of barley weighs twenty-one Dutch &s;tone, another
only fifteen. One boll of oats weighs fifteen
&s;tone, another, only eleven. The &s;ame difference
is ob&s;ervable in other grain.</P>
<P>There is another objection again&s;t &s;elling by
mea&s;ure. The &s;lovenly farmer is &s;atisfied with
bulk, without any regard to the quality of his
<PB N="199" REF="225">
grain: whereas, were it the rule to &s;ell by weight,
it would make the farmer doubly attentive to the
dre&s;&s;ing of his land, in order to produce the
weightie&s;t grain.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide weight, another circum&s;tance enters in|to

<P>CONSIDERING the great quantity of wa&s;te land
in Scotland, fit only for bearing trees, and the
ea&s;ine&s;s of tran&s;porting them by navigable arms of
the &s;ea, one cannot but regret the indolence of
our forefathers, who neglected that profitable
branch of commerce, and left us to the nece&s;&s;ity
of purcha&s;ing foreign timber for every u&s;e in life.
The Commi&s;&s;ioners of the annexed e&s;tates, deeply
&s;en&s;ible of this neglect, have be&s;towed liberally
to rai&s;e plantations every where in the King's e|&s;tates.
Their laudable example has animated
many land-proprietors, to benefit them&s;elves and
their country by the &s;ame means. The &s;pirit of
<PB N="201" REF="227">
planting is rou&s;ed; and there &s;eems little doubt
of its &s;preading wider and wider, till this country
be provided with timber for its own con&s;umpt
at lea&s;t, if not for exportation. As an author, I
am fond to do all in my power to keep up that
&s;pirit: and in that view, the pre&s;ent chapter on
the culture of fore&s;t-trees, will, I hope, be well
received. A regular treati&s;e upon the &s;ubject
would require a volume: but as I mu&s;t contract
what I have to &s;ay within the nut&s;hell of a chap|ter,
I &s;hall &s;tudy brevity, and mention nothing
but what appears material.</P>
<P>Trees are propagated by &s;eed, by cuttings, by
layers, and by &s;uckers.</P>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>1. RAISING TREES BY SEED.</HEAD>
<P>THE propagating trees by &s;eed is nature's me|thod.
One inconvenience it has, that the trees
thus rai&s;ed are not always the &s;ame with the pa|rent
plant: though they are of the &s;ame &s;pecies,
they copy not always its varieties.</P>
<P>What follows will enable us to judge of the
maturity of &s;eed. Seed inclo&s;ed in a <HI>cap&s;ula,</HI> in
a pod, or in a cone, is ripe when the covering
opens by the heat of the &s;un. The &s;eed of a
fruit-tree is ripe when it no longer adheres to the
fruit; and where unripe fruit is pulled, the &s;eed
ripens with it. In general, &s;eed is ripe when it
&s;inks in water to the bottom.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="228">
The &s;eed of the Scotch elm ripens before the
middle of June. The be&s;t way of gathering it is,
to &s;hake the tree gently: the ripe&s;t &s;eed falls fir&s;t,
which may be gathered in a &s;heet laid at the root
of the tree.</P>
<P>The &s;eed of the a&s;h and of the maple may be
put into the ground without being taken out of
its <HI>cap&s;ula.</HI></P>
<P>The be&s;t way of opening the cones of pine, &s;ir,
&amp;c. is to expo&s;e them in boxes to &s;un and dew.
The drying them in a kiln is apt to de&s;troy the
germ. The cones of the larix are at their full
&s;ize in autumn; but the &s;eed is not &s;o early ripe.
Delay gathering them till March or April, when
they begin to drop from the tree. Cut off a part
of the cone next the &s;talk, which will render it
ea&s;y to &s;eparate the quarters: the ripe&s;t &s;eed falls
out upon &s;haking the cone with the hand.</P>
<P>The &s;eed of the birch, the willow, the poplar,
the aller, being very &s;mall, is not ea&s;ily gathered:
&s;tir the ground about the&s;e trees, and it will &s;oon
be filled with young plants. With re&s;pect to the
&s;eed of the birch and a&s;h, it is &s;ingular, that when
dropt from the tree, no &s;eed takes root &s;o readily;
yet when gathered, and &s;cattered with the hand, it
&s;eldom grows.</P>
<P>As for a choice of &s;eed, &s;mall acorns gathered
from large and lofty trees, are preferable before
the large&s;t acorns of &s;maller trees. In general,
the &s;eed is always the be&s;t that is procured from
<PB N="203" REF="229">
the mo&s;t vigorous trees. But as in exten&s;ive
plantations much preci&s;ion cannot be expected, it
ought to be the chief care that the &s;eed be per|fectly
&s;ound.</P>
<P>Next, as to preparing &s;eed for &s;owing. Trees
propagated from &s;eed have all of them a tap-root,
which pu&s;hes perpendicularly downward. The
purpo&s;e of nature in this root is, to fit trees for
growing in the &s;li&s;&s;e&s;t &s;oil, and to &s;ecure them a|gain&s;t
wind; but it proves hurtful to trees intend|ed
for tran&s;plantation. A young oak five or &s;ix
years old, when taken up for tran&s;planting, has,
like a turnip, but this &s;ingle root, which will be
four or five feet long when the &s;tem is within one
foot. Planted in this manner, it &s;eldom lives.
This evil is prevented by making the &s;eed germi|nate
in moi&s;t earth, and &s;owing it in the &s;eed|bed
after the radicle is cut off. The radicle never
pu&s;hes more; and in&s;tead of it the tree pu&s;hes
out many roots, which &s;pread horizontally. Wal|nuts,
almonds, and other &s;hell-fruit, being long
of germinating, ought to be put in moi&s;t &s;and, in
order that the radicle may pu&s;h before the end of
April, to be cut off as afore&s;aid. Acorns, Chef|nuts,
and beech-ma&s;t, will germinate timeou&s;ly
in dry &s;and. In wet &s;and or moi&s;t earth, they
would, before the time of &s;owing, not only ger|minate,
but pu&s;h out long roots, which would
ruin all. As this method is too trouble&s;ome for
&s;mall &s;eeds, &s;ow them in beds as gathered: pull
<PB N="204" REF="230">
them up the &s;econd year: cut off the tap-roots:
and plant them again at the di&s;tance from each o|ther
of three or four inches. Two years after,
they may again be tran&s;planted wider; there to
remain till they be fit for the field. Some imagine,
that to deprive a tree of the tap-root prevents its
growth. But experience vouches the contrary;
and &s;o does rea&s;on. It is ob&s;ervable, that the
roots next the &s;ur&s;ace, being acce&s;&s;ible to &s;un and
moi&s;ture, are always the mo&s;t vigorous, and are
farther &s;pread than tho&s;e below. A tap-root is de|prived
of &s;un and air, and even of water, unle&s;s
where it happens to glide below the &s;urface; how
then can it equal a horizontal root in nouri&s;hing
the tree.</P>
<P>The &s;eeds of the white thorn &s;own without pre|paration,
ri&s;e not till the &s;econd year. If buried
under ground in a heap till the pulp be rotted off,
and &s;own in the &s;pring following, they will germi|nate
that very year. In&s;tead of burying them under
ground, a more approved method is, to lay them
in a heap at the end of a barn, mixed with earth.
By that method, a greater number will germinate
than in the ordinary way. I made an experiment.
One bed was &s;own with haws prepared in the or|dinary
way; and one with haws prepared in the
other way. Upon the latter bed &s;prung a double
quantity of thorns, and more vigorous. I made
another experiment upon elm-&s;eed. Of a quan|tity
gathered when ripe, the half was immediate|ly
<PB N="205" REF="231">
&s;own; the other half was carefully dried in the
&s;hade, and &s;own a fortnight after. The latter
produced a greater number of plants, and more
vigorous. Thorns are propagated &s;till more ex|peditiou&s;ly
by cuttings from the root. When
thorns are taken from the nur&s;ery to be planted
in a hedge, the roots that are either wounded by
the &s;pade, or too long, mu&s;t be cut off. Let the&s;e
be &s;hred into &s;mall parts, and &s;own in a bed pre|pared
for them: they will produce thorns that
very year. The &s;eed of the a&s;h &s;eldom germi|nates
till the &s;econd year. When gathered in the
month of October, let it be put in pots with earth,
and &s;own in the &s;pring: it will germinate imme|diately.
The ordinary way of rai&s;ing hollies, is
to &s;ow the berries entire; which is wrong: every
berry contains four &s;eeds; and the plants that
&s;pring from them are &s;o interwoven, as not to be
&s;eparable without injury. A better way is, to ga|ther
the berries in December, the later the better
if they can be &s;aved from birds. Throw them
into a tub with water, and between the hands
rub them carefully in the water till all the pulp
fall off. The good &s;eed will &s;ink to the bottom,
which, after the water is poured off, mu&s;t be laid
upon a cloth to dry. Mix them with dry &s;and,
which will pre&s;erve them all winter. Sow them
in March or April, and cover them with earth a|bout
three quarters of an inch thick.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the time of &s;owing, the be&s;t
<PB N="206" REF="232">
rule is, to imitate nature, by &s;owing when the &s;eed
is ripe; provided the tree be of a hardy kind to
endure the fro&s;t of winter. By this rule, the &s;eed
of Scotch elm ought to be &s;own in June; the &s;eed
of pine and fir in April, at which time their cones
open. Acorns, che&s;nuts, and beech-ma&s;t, ripen
in autumn, which is the time of &s;owing them.
If they ripen later, it is more &s;afe to &s;ow them in
the &s;pring following; becau&s;e the young plants
cannot re&s;i&s;t fro&s;t, if before winter they have not
acquired &s;ome degree of vigour. There is an|other
rea&s;on for &s;toring up the&s;e &s;eeds till &s;pring;
which is, that the longer they lie in the ground,
the greater ri&s;k they run of being de&s;troyed by
vermin. As the white thorn vegetates early, the
haws ought to be &s;own the fir&s;t dry weather in
February, after being &s;eparated by a wire-&s;ieve
from the mould with which they were mixed.
Avoid fre&s;h dung, which is injurious to them.
Sow the &s;eed of the larix when taken out of the
cone in March or April; for though in the cone
it will &s;tand good for years, yet it does not long
retain its vegetative quality when &s;eparated from
the cone.</P>
<P>Next as to the manner of &s;owing &s;eed. Nature
drops &s;eed upon the &s;urface of the ground. We
mu&s;t depart from nature in this in&s;tance, upon the
following account, that after much expence and
trouble in procuring &s;eed, the far greater part
would peri&s;h, partly by vermin, and partly by
<PB N="207" REF="233">
an inclement air. This is not regarded by na|ture,
which is profu&s;e in the production of &s;eed.
All &s;eeds therefore ought to be covered with earth,
birch-&s;eed alone excepted, which ought to be
pre&s;&s;ed down with the back of the &s;pade, but left
open to the air without covering. Small &s;eeds
mu&s;t be &s;lightly covered, as having le&s;s vigour to
pu&s;h upward. In &s;trong &s;oil, the covering ought
in every ca&s;e to be &s;light. The depth is pretty
much arbitrary, becau&s;e the &s;ame &s;eed will thrive
at different depths. But it mu&s;t be attended to,
that a &s;light covering expo&s;es the &s;eed to drought;
and therefore the ground ought to be watered if
the &s;ea&s;on be dry. Where the ground &s;own is
too exten&s;ive for watering, a crop of barley will
pre&s;erve the tree-&s;eed from the &s;un, and al&s;o pre|vent
weeds. The tree-&s;eed and the barley may
be &s;own alternately in lines. If trees are intended
to remain where their &s;eed is &s;own, it is proper to
&s;ow thick, partly for &s;helter, partly to keep down
weeds. M. Buffon declares again&s;t weeding the
ground upon which the &s;eed is &s;own: &startq;For,&endq;
&s;ays he, &startq;weeds &s;helter the young plants from
the &s;un, keep in the dew, and pre&s;erve the
plants warm in winter.&endq; In Scotland nothing
is more hurtful to plants than weeds, which choke
them, and exclude the air. A better way, even
in France, is to &s;ow barley with the &s;eed, which
will protect the young plants from the &s;un, and
admit the air.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="234">
The be&s;t way of pre&s;erving &s;eed is in dry &s;and,
which &s;ucks in the moi&s;ture from the &s;eed, and
prevents mu&s;tine&s;s. It withal retains &s;o much
moi&s;ture as to prevent the &s;eed from withering.
This method is chiefly u&s;eful in pre&s;erving during
winter &s;eeds that require &s;pring-&s;owing, and in
the conveyance of &s;eeds to a di&s;tance. The effi|cacy
of dry &s;and appears in pre&s;erving oranges and
citrons, which in the air dry and wither: if to
prevent withering they be laid in a moi&s;t place,
they never fail to turn mu&s;ty. There is one ex|ception,
that &s;eed which lies long in the ground
before it germinates, ought to be pre&s;erved in
moi&s;t earth. The &s;eed of the &s;en&s;itive plant will
keep entire for twenty years; of a melon for
nine or ten. There are many &s;eeds that will not
keep entire longer than two or three years; which
is the ca&s;e of flax-&s;eed, though remarkably oily:
&s;ome &s;eeds require to be put in the ground as
&s;oon as ripe.</P>
<P>To prevent young plants in the &s;eed-bed from
being &s;pewed out by fro&s;t, cover the beds with
leaves of trees, to be removed when the &s;evere
fro&s;ts are over.</P>
<P>We proceed from the &s;eed-bed to the nur&s;ery.
Plants form very different roots, according to the
&s;oil they grow in. In &s;tiff &s;oil, the roots are com|monly
few, but &s;trong and vigorous, for over|coming
the re&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch a &s;oil. Roots
multiply in proportion to the richne&s;s and mel|lowne&s;s
<PB N="209" REF="235">
of a &s;oil. An oak, for example, has
a &s;trong tap-root, which fits it, more than any
other tree, for growing in a &s;tiff &s;oil. This
root dimini&s;hes in &s;trength and &s;ize in a loam,
and &s;till more in a &s;andy &s;oil. When it grows
in water, it has a multitude of roots, but not
the lea&s;t appearance of a tap-root. Hence it
follows, that the &s;oil of a nur&s;ery ought always
to be light and free: &s;uch a &s;oil produces a mul|titude
of roots; and the vigour of growth is al|ways
in proportion to the number of roots, the
&s;maller the better. But it al&s;o follows, that in
tran&s;planting trees from &s;uch a nur&s;ery, the &s;oil
about them ought to be made as mellow and free
as po&s;&s;ible, in order to encourage the &s;mall roots.
When the&s;e are enlarged in &s;o fine a &s;oil, they
will be able to overcome the &s;tiffne&s;s of the na|tural
&s;oil of the field. Avoid dung in a nur&s;ery. If
any be admitted, it ought to be thoroughly putre|fied,
and dige&s;ted into a &s;ort of rich mould. Green
dung makes the roots ill conditioned, and encou|rages
a large white worm, which lives on the bark
of the roots. Neither the walnut nor hor&s;e-che&s;|nut
&s;ucceed in a nur&s;ery: the plants require to be
placed at a di&s;tance from each other; and the
earth about them mu&s;t be &s;tirred &s;everal years.
Aquatics that are intended to be propagated by
large cuttings, ought fir&s;t to have the benefit of
a nur&s;ery; becau&s;e they thrive be&s;t when planted
out with roots. Avoid a mixture of different
<PB N="210" REF="236">
trees in the &s;ame bed, for the &s;low growers will
be oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The true &s;ea&s;on for tran&s;planting from the &s;eed|bed
to the nur&s;ery is about the fall of the leaf.
Catch the time when the earth is &s;o moi&s;t as to
&s;uffer the plants to be drawn without tearing the
roots. All evergreens ought to be tran&s;planted in
&s;pring; and al&s;o all other trees that &s;uffer by
fro&s;t.</P>
<P>Where trees are &s;o young as that an interval of
five or &s;ix inches along the rows is &s;ufficient, there
mu&s;t be an interval of a foot at lea&s;t between the
rows, in order to give acce&s;s to clean the ground
of weeds; and this interval is &s;ufficient, even
when the plants are &s;o large as to make an inter|val
of a foot along the rows nece&s;&s;ary. Where
the di&s;tance along the rows is made eighteen
inches, or two feet, the intervals between the
rows ought to be no le&s;s, for the &s;ake of the trees,
though unnece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ake of weeding. Yet
&s;uch is the influence of cu&s;tom, contrary to com|mon
&s;en&s;e, that from the original po&s;ition of young
plants in a nur&s;ery, the interval between rows is
always made double of the interval along the
rows. Thus if the latter be eighteen inches, the
former is always made three feet; and four feet
where the &s;ize of the trees requires an interval of
two feet along the rows. The &s;ame influence of
cu&s;tom occa&s;ions trees to be planted in rows in
the field, where they are to &s;tand; and yet they
<PB N="211" REF="237">
make a much better figure when, in imitation of
nature, they are &s;cattered as at random.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>2 CUTTINGS, LAYERS, SUCKERS.</HEAD>
<P>SEED is not the only means that nature has
provided for propagating trees. They can be pro|pagated
by cuttings, by layers, and by &s;uckers.
They have one advantage, that whereas &s;eed pro|pagates
the kind only, the&s;e carry on any variety
that is in the tree from whence they are taken.
Grafting had the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>The willow, the o&s;ier, the vine, the elder, the
poplar both black and white, the platanus, the yew,
the box, may all be propagated by cuttings. The
black poplar is &s;ingular: a branch will not an&s;wer
for a cutting, unle&s;s the top be left entire. A
cutting of willow eight or ten feet long, and &s;even
or eight inches thick, planted in the following
manner, will &s;oon become a tree. Let the great
end be immer&s;ed in water a foot deep as &s;oon
as cut, which ought to be the end of March;
and remain in that &s;tate till planted, which ought
to be the beginning of May. Immediately before
planting, cut the great end &s;loping to a point;
and on the &s;ide that is not cut, keep the bark
entire down to the point. Make a hole in the
earth a foot and a half deep, &s;ufficiently large to
admit the cutting without ruffling the bark, which
would prove de&s;tructive. Any vacuity left in the
<PB N="212" REF="238">
hole mu&s;t be filled up with fre&s;h earth, and pre&s;&s;ed
down clo&s;e to the cutting. A &s;afer way, and little
le&s;s expeditious, is to make the hole with the
&s;pade, to return the earth to the hole round the
cutting, and to pre&s;s down all firm and clo&s;e. After
&s;tanding a year, throw &s;ome fre&s;h earth upon the
roots. It is &s;till better, to make a ditch two feet
from the row of the trees thus planted, and to lay
upon the roots the earth of the ditch. Several
trees that can be propagated by cuttings, require
more precaution than the willow or poplar. The
branches intended for cuttings mu&s;t be young;
and a part of the greater branch from whence
they are taken mu&s;t be cut with them, to &s;erve as
a &s;ort of root. With all the&s;e precautions, it mu&s;t
not be expected, that every cutting from the pla|tanus,
the white poplar, the poplars of Virginia
and of Lombardy, the a&s;pin, the maple with a&s;h
leaves, will take root. Cuttings from the yew, the
alaternus, the box, require the utmo&s;t care. They
ought to be planted in beds &s;heltered from the
&s;un, and watered in dry weather.</P>
<P>All trees do by layers; and the method is ea&s;y
in &s;hrubs which have branches near the ground:
but to propagate by layers from large trees that
have no branches near the ground, &s;uch as the
lime, the mulberry, the aller, more art is nece&s;|&s;ary.
One method is, to cut the tree by the
ground before the &s;ap begins to ri&s;e; which will
produce many &s;hoots the fir&s;t year. The next
<PB N="213" REF="239">
year at the &s;ame time, heap earth upon the root
till it ri&s;e a foot upon the &s;hoots. After two or
three years remove the earth, and cut off the
&s;tems, which will be full of roots as far as they
were covered with earth. The&s;e will make good
plants. Spare the &s;maller &s;tems, and cover them
with earth as before: they will in time produce
new plants. Another method is, to chu&s;e a
young tree eight or nine inches in circumference;
and cut it over two feet from the ground. In e|very
part, the &s;tump pu&s;hes many &s;hoots. The
&s;econd or third year, take all out of the ground:
lay the &s;tump with its roots and &s;hoots in a
trench; and cover them with earth, &s;o as to leave
nothing open to the air but the extremities of the
&s;hoots. The&s;e will thru&s;t out roots under the &s;ur|face,
which will afford young plants in abundance.
When a pine or a fir is cut down, the root dies
without producing any &s;hoot. Nor can the&s;e trees
be propagated either by cuttings or by layers; if
a &s;pruce $word$ be excepted, which it is &s;aid can be
propagated by cuttings.</P>
<P>To have &s;traight trees, cuttings and layers
ought to be of perpendicular branches, e&s;pecially
where the wood is hard. How long layers &s;hould
continue in the ground to have good roots, de|pends
much upon the &s;ea&s;on, and &s;till more on
the nature of the tree. A bramble will take root
on the &s;urface of the ground, without the lea&s;t
covering of earth. Layers of lime and of plata|nus
<PB N="214" REF="240">
have commonly good roots in three years,
and &s;ometimes in two. Many trees require long|er
time.</P>
<P>To propagate by &s;uckers, part of the root of
the parent plant mu&s;t be cut along with the &s;ucker.
It mu&s;t be immediately planted in a nur&s;ery, in
order to acquire roots. When planted out to
&s;tand, the old root &s;hould be cut away all but
what is clo&s;e to the &s;ucker; for it is apt to &s;well
under ground, and to ob&s;truct the growth of the
plant. To have a quantity of &s;uckers, which ri&s;e
not plentifully from old trees, cut the old tree o|ver,
and the ground will be filled with them.
Some writers &s;ay, that trees propagated by layers
take on a better &s;hape, and grow fa&s;ter, than
tho&s;e propagated by &s;uckers.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>3. SOIL PROPER FOR TREES.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;oil proper for trees comes next in order.
Fat &s;and, that is, clay mixed with a large propor|tion
of &s;and, agrees with almo&s;t every &s;ort of tree,
e&s;pecially if the &s;oil be deep. Evergreens do well
in &s;uch a &s;oil. And even aquatics, &s;uch as a&s;h, pop|lar,
willow, aller, thrive in it, though more &s;lowly
than in moi&s;t ground: the&s;e aquatics make a &s;hift
even in ground too dry for the oak, the beech,
the che&s;nut. A pine grows well in &s;and. The
juniper will grow in a very thin &s;oil where &s;carce
any other tree will thrive. An a&s;pin does well in
<PB N="215" REF="241">
a pure clay: a che&s;nut does not. Dry earth of a
good quality, though but eighteen inches above a
tough till, will bear the elm, the maple, the horn|beam,
the walnut, the a&s;h, the birch, the mul|berry,
the white poplar, and almo&s;t every kind
of &s;hrub. If but ten or twelve inches deep, it is
only fit for &s;hrubs; excepting the birch, which
will grow if the till be covered with but five or
&s;ix inches of black and light earth. The lime
and the hor&s;e-che&s;nut love a tender and deep &s;oil.
Mar&s;hy &s;oil is proper for the willow, the a&s;h, the
aller, the occidental platanus, and for mo&s;t &s;orts
of the poplar. An elder, though it makes a &s;hift
in the drie&s;t &s;oil, yet loves moi&s;ture; and there|fore
is proper for a fence on the &s;ides of ditches,
for cattle do not touch it. Ground elevated two
or three feet above a running water, being moi&s;t
without being mar&s;hy, is fit for trees of every
&s;ort, particularly for the occidental and oriental
platanus, the tulip-tree, and the lime. Young
trees &s;hould be planted differently, according to
the nature of the &s;oil: in a &s;oil retentive of moi|&s;ture,
the tree &s;hould be bulked above the &s;ur|face;
in a very dry &s;oil, the earth round the tree
&s;hould &s;lope down to the root, in order to collect
the rain. In general, though corn pro&s;pers in
clay, &s;andy or gravelly &s;oil is fitte&s;t for trees.
The culture of corn, renewed annually, renders
clay open and free; but when left untilled, it
turns too hard even for the roots of trees.</P>

<PB N="216" REF="242">
<HEAD>4. CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to climate, an oak is an inhabi|tant
of the temperate zone: none are found be|tween
the tropics, and none farther north than
Stockholm. Fir and birch bear much cold, the
latter e&s;pecially. Plants, like animals, after &s;e|veral
generations, come to thrive in a climate very
different from their own. It requires peculiar
&s;kill and attention to habituate to a new climate
&s;uch as grow on the top of the Alps, and on the
top of high mountains farther north. Their na|ture
fits them for a very cold &s;ummer; and for a
temperate winter, being always covered with
&s;now during that &s;ea&s;on. In a low country the
want of &s;now can be tolerably well &s;upplied by
&s;ome &s;mall degree of artificial heat; but in our
&s;ummers it is not ea&s;y to give them the cold of
their native place.</P>
<P>The advantages and di&s;advantages of different
expo&s;ures come under the pre&s;ent article. In
&s;pring, even a &s;trong fro&s;t hurts not plants, pro|vided
the ice be melted before they are expo&s;ed
to the &s;un: but even a moderate fro&s;t commits
great wa&s;te, if the ice continue till it be melted by
the &s;un; for the ice acts as a burning-gla&s;s. By
that means, delicate plants, expo&s;ed to the ri&s;ing
&s;un, are often de&s;troyed in &s;pring; while &s;uch
plants, expo&s;ed to the north, are &s;afe: which is
<PB N="217" REF="243">
the fate even of young &s;hoots of the oak. An
ea&s;tern expo&s;ition has, on the other hand, its ad|vantages.
Plants are &s;ooner relieved from the
morning cold by the heat of the &s;un: they are
protected from the &s;un's meridian heat: and as
the ea&s;t wind is generally dry, &s;pring-fro&s;t makes
le&s;s impre&s;&s;ion than where there is more moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>In a &s;outhern expo&s;ition, plants, being covered
from the north, are the le&s;s &s;ubject to fro&s;t. As
the &s;un reaches them not till about ten in the
morning, the &s;pring ice is commonly melted be|fore
that time; and if the climate be rainy to
temper the meridian heat, trees in that expo&s;ure
grow fa&s;t. The di&s;advantage is, at fir&s;t, that
young plants are apt to be &s;corched by the &s;un,
e&s;pecially in a light &s;oil and dry &s;ummer; and
next, that ice being frequently melted in that ex|po&s;ure,
even by winter-heat; if the moi&s;ture be
not &s;ucked up by heat or di&s;&s;ipated by wind, it is
congealed in the evening, and does much hurt.</P>
<P>A we&s;tern expo&s;ition is free from the burning
&s;un in a dry &s;ea&s;on; but is expo&s;ed to &s;pring &s;now
and hail, which come mo&s;tly from the we&s;t. We
often feel a we&s;t expo&s;ition in&s;upportably cold,
when the air is tolerably &s;oft in other expo&s;itions.
Hardy trees can bear this cold; but tender trees
are often de&s;troyed by it.</P>
<P>In a northern expo&s;ition, &s;now never melts;
and the wind from that quarter is the colde&s;t and
drie&s;t of all. By that means however per&s;piration
<PB N="218" REF="244">
is &s;o faint, that little moi&s;ture is required. Here
deciduous fore&s;t-trees grow &s;lowly; but the pine,
the fir, the yew, the evergreen oak, the box, and
other evergreens, thrive well. This fact appears
&s;ingular: evergreens per&s;pire little; and one
would think that they &s;hould, more than other
trees, need the action of the &s;un to keep their
&s;ap in motion. The birch al&s;o thrives well in a
northern a&s;pect. In a dry and light &s;oil, trees
thrive better expo&s;ed to the north, than to the
&s;outh; in the former, the dew continues on the
trees, till nine or ten in the morning; and the
&s;un &s;trikes not &s;o violently as to wither the ground,
or to occa&s;ion great per&s;piration. But a &s;outhern
a&s;pect merits the preference in a clay &s;oil, and in
a cold climate.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>5. TIME OF PLANTING TREES IN THE
FIELD.</HEAD>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the time of planting trees
where they are to &s;tand, it runs from autumn,
when they drop the leaf, till &s;pring, when the buds
begin to &s;well, provided it be fre&s;h weather, and
the ground be tolerably dry. But becau&s;e in the
dead of winter fro&s;t prevails, or too much moi|&s;ture,
two &s;ea&s;ons chiefly are recommended, viz.
autumn before &s;trong fro&s;t &s;ets in, and &s;pring after
it is pa&s;t. In this &s;ea&s;on, planting may be conti|nued
till the buds begin to open; which in &s;ome
<PB N="219" REF="245">
trees is early, in others late. The opening the
buds depends al&s;o on the &s;ea&s;on, late or early.
Whether autumn or &s;pring be the be&s;t for plant|ing,
is not agreed. As the weather is common|ly
moi&s;t in autumn, trees brought from a di&s;tance
&s;uffer le&s;s in that &s;ea&s;on by being long kept out of
the ground; and if the winter happen to be mild,
new roots are produced, which are a fine prepa|ration
for a more vigorous vegetation in &s;pring.
Millar holds October to be the be&s;t &s;ea&s;on for plant|ing
trees that lo&s;e the leaf in winter, provided the
&s;oil be dry. In a moi&s;t &s;oil, it is better, &s;ays he,
to defer planting till the latter end of February
or beginning of March. But though this may
hold in general, there are &s;everal exceptions.
Tender plants that are hurt by fro&s;t, ought to be
delayed till &s;pring. Trees that retain the leaf du|ring
winter, ought to be tran&s;planted in &s;pring;
for, having a &s;low circulation of &s;ap, they per&s;pire
little, and run le&s;s ri&s;k of being hurt by drought.
Another rea&s;on concurs with re&s;pect to the oak,
the beech, and the hornbeam, which hold the
leaf all winter; which is, that they are late in pu&s;h|ing:
when planted in February or March, they
have time to prepare new roots before the buds
begin to &s;well<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is maintained by &s;ome writers, that be&s;t &s;ea|&s;on for planting oak and larche, is immediately before the buds begin to pu&s;h. I have not di&s;covered any good rea&s;on for making the&s;e trees an exception from the ge|neral rule.</NOTE>. April is undoubtedly the be&s;t
<PB N="220" REF="246">
&s;ea&s;on for evergreens; though they may be &s;afe|ly
removed at Mid&s;ummer, if near the place where
they are to &s;tand. During winter, evergreens
are in a &s;tate approaching to re&s;t. If removed at
that &s;ea&s;on, they do not take root till the &s;pring
&s;ets the &s;ap in motion; and in a hard winter they
commonly die. Light land &s;hould infallibly be
planted in autumn; for &s;pring-planting in &s;uch
land is &s;ubject to great di&s;tre&s;s from the &s;ummer|&s;un.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>6. MANNER OF PLANTING.</HEAD>
<P>AS to the manner of planting trees in a field,
the &s;afe&s;t way to draw trees out of a nur&s;ery for
planting, is to remove the earth from the fir&s;t
row of trees, which by that means will be ea&s;ily
drawn without hurting the roots; proceeding in
the &s;ame manner till all be taken up. What are
too &s;mall, may be planted in a new bed prepared
for them. For three years after trees are tran&s;|planted
from the nur&s;ery, the ground about them
ought to be twice &s;tirred annually. Once a year
after will be &s;ufficient, till the trees get entirely
the better of weeds. Plantations weeded for a
year or two only, have vi&s;ibly langui&s;hed. As
&s;oon as trees thus cultivated begin to join their
branches, the lower branches &s;all off, and the
weeds are &s;mothered. This is the time of the
mo&s;t vigorous growth. Trees cannot be planted
<PB N="221" REF="247">
too thick, provided attention be given to thin
them timeou&s;ly. Thick planting &s;helters them
from wind and from cold. When they ri&s;e
to &s;even or eight feet hight, &s;o as to wave with
the wind, they ought to be weeded, to prevent
their rubbing upon one another, which is apt to
create a &s;ort of gangrene. But let them be weed|ed
cautiou&s;ly: fix on the weake&s;t tree, the
branches of which may be &s;hortened, for giving
room to the trees that are to &s;tand; and let the
tree be cut down a year or two after. This is a
better method than to cut down the tree at fir&s;t;
for young trees that have too much room, are
apt to branch out in&s;tead of pu&s;hing up. This
method does finely in a plantation of firs and
pines. When the trees ri&s;e to eighteen or twen|ty
feet, and by good roots are proof again&s;t
wind, they ought to be much thinned, &s;o as not
to leave one nearer another than its own length.
Where trees of that height &s;tand clo&s;e together,
they occa&s;ion a &s;tagnation of air: the air they
&s;uck in is unwhole&s;ome, and makes them lan|gui&s;h.
Young trees five or &s;ix feet high only,
occa&s;ion very little &s;tagnation of air: the free
air above mixing with that below, pre&s;erves all
&s;weet and whole&s;ome.</P>
<P>One method of making a plantation turn to
profit in a &s;hort time, is to begin with planting
birch in rows with intervals of &s;ix feet, &s;tirring
the ground about them two years. In the inter|vals
<PB N="222" REF="248">
&s;ow acorns, che&s;nuts, or beech-ma&s;t. The
birch, a fa&s;t grower, will in a few years form a
thick wood, de&s;troy the weeds, and &s;hade the
young plants below them. The birch cut out
when they begin to oppre&s;s the trees under them,
will afford &s;ome profit, and leave the ground plen|tifully
&s;tored with better trees.</P>
<P>The be&s;t way to encourage trees planted in a
row, is to draw a trench at the &s;ide of the row, at
&s;uch a di&s;tance as not to wound the roots. The
earth thrown upon the roots will &s;ave weeding,
and &s;ecure the trees again&s;t wind. The water in
that trench will be an additional nouri&s;hment to
the trees.</P>
<P>Evergreens, per&s;piring le&s;s than other plants,
require le&s;s nouri&s;hment, and for that rea&s;on con|tinue
green all winter. They re&s;emble the exan|guous
tribe of animals, the frog, the toad, the
tortoi&s;e, the &s;erpent, which, per&s;piring little, make
a &s;hift to pa&s;s the winter without food. Ever|greens,
by per&s;piring little, have a thick, vi&s;cid,
oily, &s;ap, which enables them to endure the win|ter's
cold. They &s;eem many of them to thrive
be&s;t in the temperate &s;ea&s;ons of the year; not &s;o
well in the heat of &s;ummer, their per&s;piration
being then too great for the &s;low a&s;cent of the
&s;ap. Evergreens, when tran&s;planted, do not &s;o
readily &s;trike root as other trees: for which rea|&s;on
they ought to be taken up with a bulk of
earth about their roots. Gardeners commonly
<PB N="223" REF="249">
place &s;hrubs of this kind in an o&s;ier-ba&s;ket, which
&s;oon rots after it is put into the ground with a
tree. A holly thus tran&s;planted ought to be wa|tered
in the month of May, if the &s;ea&s;on be dry.</P>
<P>In order to tran&s;plant a tree with a bulk of
earth about the roots, cut a trench round it at
the di&s;tance of ten or twelve inches, as deep as
the roots go, cutting over with a &s;harp knife all
the roots that appear. Return the earth into the
trench. Repeat the operation next year, but a
little farther from the tree. When the tree is
tran&s;planted the year after, the roots will be &s;o
interlaced in the bulk, that none of the earth
will fall away in carrying. The hole where the
tree is to &s;tand, &s;hould be con&s;iderably larger than
the bulk, and made &s;ome months before planting,
to receive the influence of fun, rain, and fro&s;t.
Fill up the hole with fre&s;h good earth, fit to en|courage
the young roots. The harder the &s;oil is,
the hole ought to be the larger, to receive the
greater quantity of the nouri&s;hing earth. In
making the hole, lay the upper <HI>&s;tratum</HI> on the
one &s;ide, and what is below on the other: lay the
former about the roots, being the be&s;t &s;oil, and
cover it with the latter. Pre&s;erve as many roots
as po&s;&s;ible, &s;hortening tho&s;e only that are too
long, and what are torn in taking up. If the
tree have too much head, &s;horten the large&s;t
branches, leaving the &s;mall branches &s;or carrying
leaves: it is by the&s;e that the &s;ap is drawn up;
<PB N="224" REF="250">
and it is by the&s;e that per&s;piration is performed.
But pre&s;erve carefully the leading &s;hoot or &s;hoots;
for many experiments have made it evident, that
the&s;e have the greate&s;t power to draw up the &s;ap.
If the lime be not an exception, a tree, after its
head is lopped off, &s;preads into a bu&s;h, but ne|ver
ri&s;es in height. Conclude all, by pre&s;&s;ing
down the earth vigorou&s;ly with the foot. A tree
planted deep in the ground, &s;tands the firmer a|gain&s;t
wind: its roots are better protected again&s;t
&s;un and fro&s;t, and le&s;s apt to throw up &s;uckers.
The&s;e con&s;iderations notwith&s;tanding, trees ought
not to be planted deep; for they langui&s;h till they
acquire roots near the &s;urface. The&s;e, &s;pread|ing
them&s;elves in the be&s;t &s;oil, and being acce&s;&s;i|ble
to &s;un and rain, convey much more nouri&s;h|ment
to the tree than tho&s;e below. Nothing
however is meant again&s;t planting large trees
deeper than what are &s;mall. At the &s;ame time,
if the under &s;oil be bad, or very moi&s;t, even large
trees ought to be planted near the &s;urface, with
a bulk of earth about them. Becau&s;e in a porous
&s;oil the &s;un penetrates deeper than in clay, and
withers the roots near the &s;urface; for that rea|&s;on
a tree ought to be planted deeper in the for|mer
than in the latter. Many think, that a fir
does be&s;t where fir-trees have been recently cut:
a fir being the native of a cold country, &s;tands
much in need of a &s;hade in &s;ummer; and there|fore
&s;ucceeds the be&s;t when protected from the
<PB N="225" REF="251">
&s;un by &s;urrounding firs. So far the ob&s;ervation
holds, and I believe no farther.</P>
<P>It ought to be an indi&s;pen&s;able duty, to vi&s;it
young plantations after every high wind, and to
&s;et upright tho&s;e that are &s;haken, pre&s;&s;ing the
earth clo&s;e about the roots. Support a tree much
&s;haken with a forked &s;tick. I know no general
rule more important than this. It is my opinion,
that more trees are lo&s;t by neglect of this opera|tion,
than any other way. The operation ought
to be renewed after every high wind, till trees
have acquired &s;uch roots as to &s;tand firm again&s;t
wind.</P>
<P>Some are careful, to give a tran&s;planted tree the
&s;ame po&s;ition with re&s;pect to the &s;un, that it had in
the nur&s;ery. But experience has proved this pre|caution
to be u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>As the expence and ri&s;k of filling up a vacant
&s;pot with a full-grown tree is great, a nur&s;ery
may be &s;et apart for rearing young trees till they
be from fifteen to eighteen feet high. The&s;e
trees may be tran&s;planted twice or thrice in the
nur&s;ery for multiplying their roots; and they
ought to be planted where they are to &s;tand, with
as much as po&s;&s;ible of the nur&s;ery-&s;oil about the
roots. In that view, fro&s;t is the proper time for
the operation. Such trees will not at fir&s;t make
&s;o great a figure as full-grown trees; but there
will be le&s;s hazard of mi&s;carrying.</P>
<P>Where trees of unequal growth are planted to|gether,
<PB N="226" REF="252">
tho&s;e of the quicke&s;t growth will overtop
the re&s;t, and de&s;troy them. Therefore let trees of
the &s;ame kind be planted in clumps; or let none
be mixed but what grow equally fa&s;t. I imagine
there is a beauty in &s;mall clumps, as it makes dif|ferent
&s;hades the more con&s;picuous. Colours, e|ven
the fine&s;t, make but a faint impre&s;&s;ion in a
confu&s;ed mixture.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5>
<HEAD>7. PRUNING.</HEAD>
<P>AND now of pruning. By multiplied experi|ments
it is a&s;certained, that the cutting off young
branches, hurts not any &s;ort of tree, not even the
walnut, nor the refinous kind. The lowe&s;t
branches, which in time would wither, and drop
off, ought fir&s;t to be cut; but gradually, that the
tree may not be bared of leaves. Severe pruning
makes trees grow tall, but withal &s;o &s;lender as
not to re&s;i&s;t wind. Every tree &s;uffers by having
its large branches cut off, but in different de|grees.
The wound of an elm is &s;oon healed:
not of a walnut, an oak, or a pine; if the tree be
not vigorous, the wound is apt to rot into the
body. When a large branch is cut off, though
the place of its in&s;ertion is &s;oon covered with wood
and bark; yet the new wood doth not unite with
the old, and there always remains a defect
within. When an overgrown branch is cut clo&s;e
to the trunk, which ought to be at the end of the
<PB N="227" REF="253">
year, the young &s;hoots mu&s;t the next June or
July be pulled off with the hand. If cut off with
a knife, &s;hoots will grow without end, and create
a disfiguring bunch in the tree. A writer who&s;e
integrity equals his experience, affirms, that a
branch cut &s;ome inches from the trunk will make
no blemi&s;h in the tree<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Kennedy.</NOTE>. The greate&s;t attention
ought to be given to the head: if forked, one
of the rival branches mu&s;t be cut off &s;ix inches
high; and to the remaining &s;tump ought to be
tied the other branch, in order to give it an up|right
direction. If a young tree become &s;tatio|nary,
as it is apt to do in &s;tiff &s;oil, cut it over by
the ground in September, or rather below the
ground. Next June or July tear off with the
hand all the &s;hoots but the &s;tronge&s;t, and lay earth
round the &s;tump. If this be delayed till the $ap
fall, there is danger of tearing the bark of the
&s;tump, which would hurt it. Avoid a knife; for
at every amputation &s;hoots will pu&s;h, which mu&s;t
again be cut, and a bunch will grow.</P>
<P>Pruning may go on from the beginning of July
to the middle of September: trees later pruned
&s;uffer by cold. A holly is an exception: it has a
large heart, and is hurt by fro&s;t if clipped or pru|ned
after the month of July. A holly-hedge,
that was not clipped after the month of June,
<PB N="228" REF="254">
endured without hurt the hard fro&s;t of the year
1740.</P>
<P>The Scotch fir, which is not a fir but a pine,
de&s;erves to be cultivated for beauty as well as for
u&s;e. In a natural wood, the timber is always
better, and freer of knots, than in a plantation.
Trees are always planted at the &s;ame time; but
in a natural wood are of different ages, the elder
bearing down the younger, but not without lo&s;ing
all their under branches. This in effect proves a
benefit; for as the under branches do not &s;pring
again, there happens to be much timber without
knots. In a planted field, on the contrary, the
trees grow all equally; and if weeding be ne|glected,
they grow up like &s;pindles without a la|teral
branch: if duly weeded, &s;o as to give room
for lateral branches, the lower branches die by
degrees, and leave knots in the trees. Therefore
to train a fir-plantation, the trees ought to be
thinned as &s;oon as they begin to wind-wave; and
the lowe&s;t tire of branches &s;hould be cut off from
every tree that is intended to &s;tand. Another tire
&s;hould be cut off the next year; and &s;o on, leaving
five or &s;ix feet of the trunk without a branch. All
the wood that is added to the tree after, will be &s;olid
without a knot. A better way is, to tear off with
the hand the under branches, which bring their
roots with them: the hollow is &s;oon filled up with
regular fibres, and the wood is all equally good.
A branch cut away with a knife, though clo&s;e to
<PB N="229" REF="255">
them &s;tem, leaves its root, which becomes a knot
when &s;urrounded with new wood. If a Scotch
fir be intended for beauty, let all other trees be
kept at a di&s;tance, and it will &s;tand forty or fifty
years without lo&s;ing a branch. When a larche is
fifteen or &s;ixteen feet high, cut off the lowe&s;t
tire of branches in October clo&s;e to the &s;tem, and
the next two tire &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, year after year.
The rays of the &s;un will be admitted to the root
of the tree; and the air will have a free circula|tion,

<HEAD>8. WOOD PROPER FOR INSTRUMENTS OF
HUSBANDRY.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the mo&s;t expen&s;ive articles of a farm,
are carts, ploughs, brakes, harrows, rollers, &amp;c.:
and it is of importance with re&s;pect to economy,
that the&s;e &s;hould be con&s;tructed of proper wood.
To that end the following hints may be of u&s;e.</P>
<P>I begin with examining, at what age a tree is in
perfection for the purpo&s;es of a farm. At the
age of &s;ixty, it is &s;ufficiently large for every farm-purpo&s;e;
being, when cut to the &s;quare, from
twelve to fifteen inches each &s;ide. I mu&s;t except
the oak, which, even for the purpo&s;es of farm|ing,
improves till it be a hundred years old. E|very
oak con&s;i&s;ts of red and white wood; the
former the firme&s;t of all wood, the latter good
for nothing. A&s;h, after the growth of &s;ixty years,
turns &s;hort and brittle.</P>
<P>The proper &s;ea&s;on for cutting a tree is, when it
has lea&s;t &s;ap; which is preci&s;ely in the middle
<PB N="231" REF="257">
between the time of &s;hedding the leaf and that
of budding: in that interval it is tough, and fit|te&s;t
for every farm-purpo&s;e. When cut in the
&s;ap, the wood is &s;hort, and apt to &s;plit with
drought.</P>
<P>For pre&s;erving wood after being cut, there are
three methods. One is, to dry it in the air; an|other,
to immer&s;e it in water; and a third, to
cover it up with hor&s;e-dung. A&s;h, when &s;aw|ed
green, never fails to &s;plit. Before applying an
in&s;trument, it ought to be expo&s;ed eighteen
months in a dry &s;ituation, that all the &s;ap may e|vaporate.
During that time, both ends ought to
be covered from the air: the bark prevents the
body from &s;plitting; but when the ends are expo|&s;ed,
they will &s;plit into the body five or &s;ix inches.
When a&s;h is de&s;igned for u&s;es that require it to be
&s;plit, let it be &s;plit immediately after cutting, and
the parts laid up where the air has not free acce&s;s,
in order that they may dry by &s;low degrees; for
&s;udden drought makes them warp. Oak and elm
require the &s;ame treatment. The Huntington wil|low,
and other willows that ri&s;e to a large &s;ize,
turn extremely tough when dry; and therefore,
if intended for planks or boards, they ought to
be &s;awed directly after being cut. But as in this
ca&s;e they are apt to &s;plit, great care ought to be
taken to dry them &s;lowly. Alder and birch ought
to be managed in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>The immer&s;ing in water, and covering with
<PB N="232" REF="258">
hor&s;e-dung, are far from being the be&s;t methods
of drying wood. It is always harder and tougher
when dried &s;lowly in the air. Therefore the&s;e
methods are only for expedition, in order to ex|tract
the &s;ap the more quickly, when the wood is
wanted for immediate u&s;e.</P>
<P>There is not an in&s;trument of hu&s;bandry that
con&s;i&s;ts of different parts, but requires wood of
different kinds. Of all wood, oak is that which
re&s;i&s;ts moi&s;ture the be&s;t, and can the be&s;t endure
the being totally deprived of air. For the&s;e rea&s;ons,
oak is the only wood fit for being morti&s;ed into
other wood. From the part that is morti&s;ed, air
is totally excluded; and yet &s;ome moi&s;ture finds
acce&s;s, being more penetrating than air. There|fore,
the &s;pokes of a wheel, which are morti&s;ed
both into the nave and fillies, ought indi&s;pen&s;ably
to be of oak; the &s;heths of harrows, which bind
the parts together, ought to be of the &s;ame wood;
as al&s;o the head of the chain-plough, becau&s;e it is
morti&s;ed into the beam. As a&s;h is le&s;s apt to
&s;plit than oak, it is the more proper wood of the
two for naves and fillies. As it is the toughe&s;t of
all wood, and the mo&s;t ela&s;tic, it is fitte&s;t for the
trams of a cart. The be&s;t wood for the body of
a cart or waggon, is the Huntington willow. It
is both lighter and tougher than even the be&s;t
red fir. The head of the Scotch plough may be
of alder, becau&s;e it is not morti&s;ed into any other
part. Whatever the plough be, the mouldboard
<PB N="233" REF="259">
may be of willow, or alder, or plane; becau&s;e
they are lighter, and not apt to &s;plit. The bulls of
brakes and harrows &s;hould be of birch or alder. A
roller &s;hould be made of beech wood, being heavy,
the &s;heths and pins of oak, and the &s;hafts of a&s;h.
Foreign fir is the be&s;t and cheape&s;t for couples.
Beech-wood is firmer and tougher. It is indeed
apt to take the worm: but in a farm-hou&s;e that
is not lofted, will not the japanning with &s;moke
prevent that evil? The handles of &s;pades, &s;ho|vels,
picks, &amp;c. ought undoubtedly to be of
a&s;h: be&s;ide its toughne&s;s, it is le&s;s apt to turn
warm in handling, than any other wood. For
gates, fir is undoubtedly the be&s;t: It is light;
it re&s;i&s;ts moi&s;ture; and is not apt to warp.</P>
<P>One general rule I give, of more importance
than at fir&s;t view may be thought, which is, that
the angle made by morti&s;ing, or otherwi&s;e, being
always the weake&s;t part of the in&s;trument, ought
to be fortified with a plate of iron fitting accurate|ly
the angle of the wood.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">FLAX.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING fini&s;hed what I had to &s;ay on fore&s;t-trees,
flax comes next in order, according
to the di&s;tribution made above. The regulations
publi&s;hed by the tru&s;tees for manufactures, have
left me little to ob&s;erve upon that article. I &s;hall
<PB N="234" REF="260">
venture a few particulars only, more immediately
connected with hu&s;bandry. Annual weeds a|bound
&s;o much in this country by carele&s;s ma|nagement,
that the weeding of flax is the greate&s;t
incumbrance on its culture. After hor&s;e-hoed
turnip, cabbage, or potatoes, flax &s;ucceeds well;
and I know no other crops that extirpate weeds
&s;o effectually. A potato-crop being removed in
October, the ground during winter gets a fro&s;t-preparation;
which cannot be obtained after cab|bage
or turnip, becau&s;e the&s;e keep the ground all
winter. Therefore, above all, I recommend a
potato-crop as a preparation for flax. Next to it.
if at all inferior, is pa&s;ture-ground three or four
years old, left rough in foggage, and in that &s;tate
trench-ploughed before winter. It gets the fro&s;t-preparation,
is clean of weeds: and the rough
foggage, turned to the bottom of the furrow, re|tains
moi&s;ture like a &s;punge, which it yields plen|tifully
to the roots of the flax. Flax is a thir&s;ty
plant; and a better &s;ituation it cannot have for
procuring nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>In pulling flax, the fully ripe ought to be &s;eparated
from what is le&s;s &s;o, and the tall from the &s;hort:
when mixed, they neither water well, nor dre&s;s
well. Let the &s;eed, when &s;eparated from the
plant, be beat lightly and pa&s;&s;ed through a &s;ieve.
The be&s;t and plumpe&s;t will come out fir&s;t; and
this ought to be re&s;erved for &s;owing again. Beat
what remains with a heavier hand: the &s;eed thus
got will be fit for the oil-mill.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="261">
Lint pulled green requires more watering than
when fully ripe.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">HOPS.</HEAD>
<P>THE la&s;t article of this kind I undertook, is
the hop. A regular hop-yard is an under|taking
too great for an ordinary farmer; but e|very
farmer, by the following plan, may have hops
of his own growing &s;ufficient for his own u&s;e, and
perhaps for his neighbours. If I can reduce the
expence within moderate bounds, I am not afraid
of the climate of Scotland: many judicious trials
made here, have produced good hops.</P>
<P>Dr Woodward has ob&s;erved, that the fruit
which grows neare&s;t the ground, is always the
be&s;t. This has &s;ugge&s;ted to me a thought, that
hops may be propagated in the e&s;palier way like
apples or pears. Fix in the ground, at an inter|val
of three feet, a number of poles eight or nine
feet high, in a line from we&s;t to ea&s;t. Beginning
at the we&s;t end, plant a hop-vine at the foot of
every pole, the la&s;t &s;ix or &s;even excepted. In|&s;tead
of allowing them to a&s;cend the poles, train
them from we&s;t to ea&s;t in an angle with the ho|rizon
of nine or ten degrees, and directing them
from pole to pole by &s;mall twigs between the
poles. In this manner, each vine may extend
it&s;elf twenty or thirty feet, without ri&s;ing at its
<PB N="236" REF="262">
extremity more than ten feet above the ground. If
a hop re&s;emble other fruit-trees, it will carry more
fruit by having the growth of the wood checked.
And if this method &s;ucceed, a &s;mall hop-planta|tion
may be within the reach of every farmer, re|quiring
&s;ome attention, but little expence. Poles
above twenty feet long, renewed every two or
three years, is a mo&s;t expen&s;ive article in an Eng|li&s;h
hop-yard; and the places in Scotland are few
where they can be procured at any rate: but poles
of nine or ten feet may be procured every where.
There is another &s;ignal advantage of this method:
Wind is a great enemy to a hop-yard; but a row
of humble poles bound together by hop-vines will
be &s;ufficiently &s;ecure again&s;t wind, e&s;pecially in a
line from we&s;t to ea&s;t.</P>
<P>Taking it for granted, that the fruit next the
ground is the be&s;t, I am in the cour&s;e of an ex|periment
with a young apple-tree having two
branches, one trained to the we&s;t, the other to
the ea&s;t, upon &s;mall pegs of wood about &s;ix inches
high. Under the&s;e branches the earth is covered
with &s;harp &s;and, in order that the fruit may be
benefited both by the direct and reflected rays of
the &s;un. It de&s;erves an experiment, whether
hops may not be trained &s;ucce&s;sfully the &s;ame
way, without the expence of any poles. It will
co&s;t very little expence to fill a whole acre in that
manner, making an interval of a foot or eighteen
inches, in order that the &s;un may have acce&s;s to
all of them equally.</P>

<PB N="237" REF="263">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">MANURES.</HEAD>
<P>THE manures commonly u&s;ed in Scotland
are dung, lime, &s;hell-marl, clay-marl, and
&s;tone-marl. Many other &s;ub&s;tances are u&s;ed;
&s;havings of horn, for example, refu&s;e of malt,
and even old rags: but as the quantity that can
be procured is incon&s;iderable, and as their appli|cation
is &s;imple, I &s;hall con&s;ume no time upon
them.</P>
<P>Dung is the chief of all manures; becau&s;e a
quantity of it may be collected in every farm,
and becau&s;e it makes the quicke&s;t return. A
field &s;ufficiently dunged, will produce good crops
four or five years.</P>
<P>Dung of animals that chew the cud, being
more thoroughly putre&s;ied than that of others, is
fit to be mixed with the &s;oil without needing to be
collected into a dunghill. A hor&s;e does not chew
the cud; and in hor&s;e-dung may be perceived
&s;traw or ryegra&s;s broken into &s;mall parts, but not
di&s;&s;olved: it is proper therefore that the putrefac|tion
be completed in a dunghill. It ought to be
mixed there with cool materials: &s;o hot it is,
that in a dunghill by it&s;elf, it &s;inges and burns in|&s;tead
of putrefying. The difference between the
dung of a hor&s;e and of a horned animal, is vi&s;ible
<PB N="238" REF="264">
in a pa&s;ture-field: the gra&s;s round the former is
withered; round the latter, it is ranker and more
verdant than in the re&s;t of the field. A mixture
of dry and moi&s;t &s;tuff, ought to be &s;tudied: the
former attracting moi&s;ture from the latter, they
become equally moi&s;t.</P>
<P>To prevent &s;ap from running out of a dung|hill,
its &s;ituation &s;hould be a little below the &s;ui|face;
and to prevent rain from running into it,
it &s;hould be &s;urrounded with a ring of &s;od. If the
&s;oil on which the dunghill &s;tands be porous, let
it be paved, to prevent the &s;ap from &s;inking into
the ground. If moi&s;ture happen to &s;uperabound,
it may be led off by a &s;mall gutter to impregnate
a quantity of rich mould laid down to receive it,
which will make it equal to good dung.</P>
<P>Straw &s;hould be prepared for the dunghill, by
being laid under cattle, and &s;ufficiently moi&s;tened.
When laid dry into a dunghill, it keeps it open,
admits too much air, and prevents putrefaction.</P>
<P>Dung from the &s;table ought to be carefully
&s;pread on the dunghill, and mixed with the former
dung. When left in heaps upon the dunghill, fer|mentation
and putrefaction go on unequally.</P>
<P>Complete putrefaction is of importance with re|gard
to the &s;eed of weeds that are in the dung|hill:
if they remain &s;ound, they are carried out
with the dung, and infe&s;t the ground. Com|plete
putrefaction is of &s;till greater importance by
pulveri&s;ing the dung; in which condition it mixes
<PB N="239" REF="265">
intimately with the &s;oil, and operates the mo&s;t
powerfully. In land intended for barley, undi|ge&s;ted
dung has an unhappy effect: it keeps the
ground open, admits drought, and prevents the
&s;eed from &s;pringing. On the other hand, when
thoroughly rotted, it mixes with the &s;oil, and en|ables
it to retain moi&s;ture. It follows, that the
propere&s;t time for dunging a field, is in its highe&s;t
pulveration; at which time the earth mixes inti|mately
with the dung. Immediately before &s;et|ting
cabbage, &s;owing turnip, or wheat, is a good
time. Dung divides and &s;preads the mo&s;t accu|rately
when moi&s;t. Its intimate mixture with the
&s;oil is of &s;uch importance, that hands &s;hould be
employed to divide and &s;pread any lumps that may
be in it.</P>
<P>Dung &s;hould be &s;pread, and ploughed into the
ground, without delay. When a heap lies two or
three weeks, &s;ome of the moi&s;ture is embibed in|to
the ground, which will produce tufts of corn
more vigorous than in the re&s;t of the field. There
cannot be a wor&s;e practice than to lead out dung
before winter, leaving it expo&s;ed to fro&s;t and
&s;now. The whole &s;prit of the dung is extracted
by rain, and carried off with it. The dung di|ve&s;ted
of its &s;ap becomes dry in &s;pring, and inca|pable
of being mixed with the mould. It is turn|ed
over whole by the plough, and buried in the
&s;urrow.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="266">
I approve not of ploughing down buck-wheat,
red clover, or any other crop, for manure. The
be&s;t way of converting a crop into manure is, to
pa&s;s it through the body of an animal. The dung
and pi&s;s, not to mention the profit of feeding,
will enrich the ground more than to plough down
the crop.</P>
<P>As dung is an article of the utmo&s;t importance
in hu&s;bandry, one &s;hould imagine, that the col|lecting
it would be a capital article with an indu|&s;trious
farmer. Yet an ingenious writer, ob&s;er|ving
that the Jamaicans are in this particular much
more indu&s;trious than the Briti&s;h, a&s;cribes the
difference to the difficulty of procuring dung in
Jamaica. &startq;In England, where the long winter
enables a farmer to rai&s;e what quantity he
plea&s;es, it is not collected with any degree of
indu&s;try. But in Jamaica, where there is no
winter, and where the heat of the &s;un is a
great ob&s;truction, the farmer mu&s;t be indefa|tigable,
or he will never rai&s;e any dung.&endq;
Cool intere&s;t is not alone a &s;ufficient motive with
the indolent, to be active. As dung is of great
importance in hu&s;bandry, a farmer cannot be too
a&s;&s;iduous, in collecting animal and vegetable &s;ub|&s;tances
that will rot. One article of that kind
there is, to collect which there is a double mo|tive,
and yet is neglected almo&s;t every where.
A farm full of weeds is a nui&s;ance to the neigh|bourhood:
<PB N="241" REF="267">
it poi&s;ons the fields around; and the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or ought to be di&s;graced as a pe&s;t to &s;o|ciety.
Now the cutting down every weed before
the &s;eed is formed, an&s;wers two excellent pur|po&s;es.
Fir&s;t, it encourages good crops by keep|ing
the ground clean. Next, the&s;e weeds mixed
with other materials in a dunghill, may add con|&s;iderably
to the quantity of dung.</P>
<P>Next of lime, which is a profitable manure, and
greatly profitable when it can be got in plenty
within a moderate di&s;tance. Philo&s;ophers differ
widely about its nature, and the cau&s;e of its ef|fects;
and they talk &s;o loo&s;ely, as to convince a
plain farmer that the matter is very little under|&s;tood.
But practice is our pre&s;ent theme; and
the benefit of lime is &s;o vi&s;ible, that the u&s;e of it
has become general, where the price and carriage
are in any degree moderate.</P>
<P>However people may differ in other particulars,
all agree, that the operation of lime depends on
its intimate mixture with the &s;oil; and therefore
that the proper time of applying it, is when it is
perfectly powdered and the &s;oil at the &s;ame time
in the highe&s;t degree of pulveration. This opi|nion
appears to have a &s;olid foundation. Lime
of it&s;elf is ab&s;olutely barren; and yet it enriches
a barren &s;oil. Neither of the two produces any
good effect without the other: therefore the ef|fect
mu&s;t depend on the mixture; and con&s;e|quently
<PB N="242" REF="268">
the more intimately they are mixed the
effect mu&s;t be the greater<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mr Buchanan of Achle&s;hy, in Perth&s;hire, prepared a quantity of lime for manuring a moor ploughed before winter. Lime was immediately &s;pread upon a part of it; but the work was &s;topped by bad weather. The re|maining lime was indeed covered with &s;od, but &s;o &s;light|ly as not to throw off the rain. When laid on the re&s;t of the field in March, it was &s;o clotted as to be but very imperfectly mixed with the &s;oil. The crop of oats on the part fir&s;t limed was good; that on the part la&s;t limed was good for nothing. The &s;ub&s;equent crops however on this part proved tolerable, the lime by repeated ploughings being better mixed with the &s;oil.&mdash;In &s;e|veral parts of Scotland are found lime&s;tone of two different &s;orts. The operation of the one is quick when &s;pread upon a field after calcination; but its pro|lific effects are &s;oon over. The other operates more &s;lowly; but its prolific effects continue longer. The former upon being flaked falls readily into a very fine powder: the latter falls more &s;lowly into a powder that is not &s;o fine. This accounts for the difference. The fine powder mixes more intimately with the &s;oil, and more quickly, than the coar&s;e powder. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, the fine powder makes the be&s;t cement, by mix|ing ea&s;ily and perfectly with the &s;and and water.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, that lime ought always to be
&s;laked with a proper quantity of water, becau&s;e
by that means it is reduced the mo&s;t effectually
into powder. Lime left to be &s;laked by a moi&s;t
air, or accidental rain, is &s;eldom or never tho|roughly
reduced into powder; and therefore can
never be intimately mixed with the &s;oil. Some|times
<PB N="243" REF="269">
an opportunity offers to bring home &s;hell-lime
before the ground is ready for it; and it is
commonly thrown into a heap without cover,
tru&s;ting to rain for &s;laking. The proper way is,
to lay the &s;hell-lime in different heaps on the
ground where it is to be &s;pread, to reduce the&s;e
heaps into powder by &s;laking with water, and to
cover the &s;laked lime with &s;od &s;o as to defend it
from rain. One however would avoid as much as
po&s;&s;ible the bringing home lime before the ground
be ready for it. Where allowed to lie long in a
heap, there are two bad con&s;equences: fir&s;t, lime
attracts moi&s;ture, even though well covered, and
runs into clots, which prevents an intimate mix|ture;
and, next, we learn from Dr Black, that
burnt lime&s;tone, whether in &s;hells or in powder,
returns gradually into its original &s;tate of lime-&s;tone;
and upon that account al&s;o, is le&s;s capable
of being mixt with the &s;oil. And this is verified
by a fact, that after lying long, it is &s;o hard
bound together as to require a pick to &s;eparate
the parts.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on, it is a bad practice, tho'
common, to let &s;pread lime lie on the &s;urface all
winter. The bad effects above mentioned take
place here in part: and there is another; that rain
wa&s;hes the lime down to the furrows, and in a
hanging field carries the whole away.</P>
<P>As the particles of powdered lime are both
&s;mall and heavy, they quickly &s;ink to the bottom
<PB N="244" REF="270">
of the furrow, if care be not taken to prevent it.
In that view, it is a rule, that lime be &s;pread, and
mixed with the &s;oil, immediately before &s;owing,
or along with the &s;eed. In this manner of appli|cation,
there being no occa&s;ion to move it till the
ground be &s;tirred for a new crop, it has time to
incorporate with the &s;oil, and does not readily
&s;eparate from it. Thus, if turnip-&s;eed is to be
&s;own broadca&s;t, the lime ought to be laid on im|mediately
before &s;owing, and harrowed in with
the &s;eed. If a crop of drilled turnip or cabbage
be intended, the lime ought to be &s;pread imme|diately
before forming the drills. With re&s;pect
to wheat, the lime ought to be &s;pread imme|diately
before &s;eed-furrowing. If &s;pread more ear|ly,
before the ground be &s;ufficiently broken, it
&s;inks to the bottom. If a light &s;oil be prepared
for barley, the lime ought to be &s;pread after &s;eed-&s;urrowing,
and harrowed in with the &s;eed. In a
&s;trong &s;oil, it &s;inks not &s;o readily to the bottom;
and therefore, before &s;owing the barley, the lime
ought to be mixed with the &s;oil by a brake.
Where moor is &s;ummer-fallowed for a crop of
oats next year, the lime ought to be laid on im|mediately
before the la&s;t ploughing, and braked
in as before. It has &s;ufficient time to incorporate
with the &s;oil before the land be &s;tirred again.</P>
<P>The quantity to be laid on, depends on the
nature of the &s;oil. Upon a &s;trong &s;oil, &s;eventy
or eighty bolls of &s;hells are not more than &s;uffi|cient,
<PB N="245" REF="271">
reckoning four &s;mall firlots to the boll,
termed wheat-mea&s;ure; nor will it be an over|doze
to lay on a hundred bolls. Between fifty
and &s;ixty may &s;uffice upon medium &s;oils; and
upon the thin or gravelly, between thirty and
forty. It is not &s;afe to lay a much greater quan|tity
on &s;uch &s;oils.</P>
<P>It is common to lime a pa&s;ture-field immediate|ly
before ploughing. This is an un&s;afe practice:
it is thrown to the bottom of the furrow, from
which it is never fully gathered up. The proper
time for liming a pa&s;ture-field, intended to be ta|ken
up for corn, is a year at lea&s;t, or two, before
ploughing. It is wa&s;hed in by rain among the
roots of the plants; and has time to incorporate
with the &s;oil.</P>
<P>With regard to the expence of carriage, to
have the lime-kiln &s;o near as to go twice a-day, is
a great &s;aving. But if there can be but one car|riage
in a day, there is little difference as to ex|pence,
whether the di&s;tance be &s;even or eleven
miles. A little more food to the cattle makes all
equal.</P>
<P>Lime&s;tone beat &s;mall makes an excellent ma|nure,
and &s;upplies the want of powdered lime,
where there is no feuel to burn the lime&s;tone.
Lime&s;tone beat &s;mall has not hitherto been much
u&s;ed as a manure; and the proportion between
it and powdered lime has not been a&s;certained.
What follows may give &s;ome light. Three
<PB N="246" REF="272">
pounds of raw lime is by burning reduced to two
pounds of &s;hell-lime. Yet nothing is expelled by
the fire but the air that was in the lime&s;tone:
the calcarious earth remains entire. <HI>Ergo,</HI> two
pounds of &s;hell-lime contains as much calcarious
earth as three pounds of raw lime&s;tone. Shell|lime
of the be&s;t quality, when &s;laked with water,
will mea&s;ure out to thrice the quantity. But as
lime&s;tone lo&s;es none of its bulk by being burnt
into &s;hells, it follows, that three bu&s;hels of raw
lime&s;tone contains as much calcarious earth as &s;ix
bu&s;hels of powdered lime. And con&s;equently,
if powdered lime po&s;&s;e&s;s not &s;ome virtue above
raw lime&s;tone, three bu&s;hels of the latter beat
&s;mall &s;hould equal as a manure &s;ix bu&s;hels of the
former.</P>
<P>Shell-marl, as a manure, is managed in every
re&s;pect like powdered lime, with this only differ|ence,
that a fifth or a fourth part more in mea|&s;ure
ought to be given. The rea&s;on is, that &s;hell|marl
is le&s;s weighty than lime, and that a boll of
it contains le&s;s calcarious earth, which is the fruc|tifying
part of both.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with clay and &s;tone marls,
which, with re&s;pect to hu&s;bandry, are the &s;ame,
though in appearance different. The manures
hitherto mentioned are re&s;toratives only: they
recruit land when worn out by cropping, and en|able
it to bear more crops. The marl now un|der
con&s;ideration is not only a re&s;torative, but has
<PB N="247" REF="273">
an effect &s;till more de&s;irable, that of altering the
nature of the &s;oil, and improving its texture, &s;o
as to convert it from light to heavy, and from
weak to &s;trong. I know nothing comparable to
it in that re&s;pect, but the poaching light land by
cattle fed with turnip, mentioned in a forego|ing
chapter. It has another effect, in appear|ance
oppo&s;ite; which is, to loo&s;en a clay &s;oil, and
to make it more free.</P>
<P>The goodne&s;s of this marl depends on the
quantity of calcarious earth in it; which I have
known to amount to a half or more. It is too
expen&s;ive if the quantity be le&s;s than a third or a
fourth part. Good marl is the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial
of all manures; becau&s;e it improves the weake&s;t
ground to equal the be&s;t borough-acres. One in|&s;tance
I know, of two ridges marled a hundred
and twenty years ago, that at this day make a fi|gure
both in gra&s;s and corn far above the re&s;t of
the field. The low part of Berwick&s;hire, term|ed
<HI>the Mer&s;es</HI> abounds every where with this
marl; and is the only country in Scotland where
it is in plenty.</P>
<P>As none of the manures I am acquainted with
make any di&s;tinction between weeds and corn,
the land ought to be cleared of weeds before
marling; and it ought to be &s;moothed with the
brake and harrow, in order that the marl may be
equally &s;pread. Marl is a fo&s;&s;il on which no ve|getable
will grow: its efficacy depends, like that of
<PB N="248" REF="274">
lime, on its pulveration, and intimate mixture
with the &s;oil. Toward the former, alternate
drought and moi&s;ture contribute greatly, as al&s;o
fro&s;t. Therefore after being evenly &s;pread, it
ought to lie on the &s;urface all winter. In the
month of October, it may be rou&s;ed with a brake,
which will bring to the &s;urface, and expo&s;e to the
air and fro&s;t, all the hard parts, and mix with the
&s;oil all that is powdered. In that re&s;pect it differs
widely from dung and lime, which ought to be
ploughed into the ground without delay. Oats
is a hardy grain, which will an&s;wer for being the
fir&s;t crop after marling, better than any other;
and it will &s;ucceed though the marl be not tho|roughly
mixed with the &s;oil. In that ca&s;e, the
marl ought to be ploughed in with an ebb furrow
immediately before &s;owing, and braked thorough|ly.
It is tickli&s;h to make wheat the fir&s;t crop: if
&s;own before winter, fro&s;t &s;wells the marl, and is
apt to throw the &s;eed out of the ground; if &s;own
in &s;pring, it will &s;uffer more than oats by want of
due mixture.</P>
<P>Summer is the proper &s;ea&s;on for marling; be|cau&s;e
in that &s;ea&s;on the marl, being dry, is not
only lighter, but is ea&s;ily reduced to powder.
Fro&s;t however is not improper for marling, e&s;pe|cially
as in fro&s;t there is little opportunity for any
other work.</P>
<P>Marl is a heavy body, and &s;inks to the bottom
of the furrow, if indi&s;creetly ploughed. There|fore
<PB N="249" REF="275">
the fir&s;t crop &s;hould always have an ebb fur|row.
During the growing of that crop, the
marl has time to incorporate with the &s;oil, and to
become a part of it; after which it does not rea|dily
&s;eparate.</P>
<P>Stone marl is &s;o hard by a con&s;iderable mixture
of &s;and, that it will continue without di&s;&s;olving
for years. In that ca&s;e, the expence of breaking
the larger lumps with hammers would not be lo&s;t:
&s;uch lumps have no effect to promote vegetation;
and they are be&s;ide an ob&s;truction to ploughing
and harrowing.</P>
<P>About twenty years ago, many Mer&s;e tenants ap|plied
their whole &s;trength to marling, with very
great &s;ucce&s;s: and yet of late they &s;eem more in|tent
on liming; which may appear &s;ingular in a
country where hu&s;bandry goes on with alacrity.
But lea&s;es in that country are commonly limited
to nineteen years, which, it is thought, affords
too little time for drawing all the profit from this
expen&s;ive manure, that the tenant is intitled to.
To marl to perfection, requires four hundred cart|loads
on an acre, as much as can be drawn by
two &s;turdy hor&s;es; which, at a moderate com|putation,
co&s;ts about L. 4 per acre. But a field
can be &s;uffciently limed from the di&s;tance of fif|teen
Engli&s;h miles, for little above the half of that
&s;um; with this additional convenience, that a
farmer can hire carts for liming, in&s;tead of being
con&s;ined to his own hor&s;es, as he mu&s;t be in marl|ing;
<PB N="250" REF="276">
by which means, liming can be carried on
with much more expedition than marling. Not|with&s;tanding
the&s;e differences, it is ea&s;y to evince,
that even on a lea&s;e of nineteen years, marl will
afford a greater profit than lime. Limed ground
cannot bear without injury above three or four
crops; after which it ought to be laid down in
gra&s;s. A field well marled, will produce rich
crops of corn, in the &s;imple&s;t manner of culture,
as long as the lea&s;e endures. Now, though gra&s;s
is more profitable than corn in a poor &s;oil, the
profit bears no proportion in a rich &s;oil, which
produces excellent crops, with no greater labour
nor expence than is nece&s;&s;arily be&s;towed on poor
&s;oil.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">FENCES.</HEAD>
<P>IN Scotland, fences of &s;everal kinds are u&s;ed.
Stone-walls and thorn-hedges are the be&s;t and
the mo&s;t common.</P>
<P>The height of a dry-&s;tone wall is directed by
the u&s;e it is intended for. If intended for &s;heep,
it cannot be under &s;ix feet high, every rood of
which, being thirty-&s;ix &s;quare ells, will at a medium
co&s;t twenty &s;hillings. A dry-&s;tone wall for hor&s;es
or horned cattle cannot be u$der five feet high.
The expence of inclo&s;ing in this manner is con&s;i|derable.
<PB N="251" REF="277">
A &s;quare field of ten acres inclo&s;ed with
a wall &s;ix feet high, will co&s;t L. 50, 15 s.; and
L. 42: 5: 10, if the wall be five feet high. And
it will require two and one half per cent. to keep
them in order. To build with lime, as many
do, inflames the co&s;t; and yet upon the whole is
a &s;aving where lime is at hand.</P>
<P>To reduce both the expence of building dry|&s;tone
walls, and of upholding them, I warmly re|commend
the following mode. Rai&s;e the wall to
the height only of two feet and a half, and cope
it with &s;od in the following manner. Fir&s;t, lay on
the wall with the graf&s;y &s;ide undermo&s;t, &s;od cut
with the &s;pade four or five inches deep, and of a
length to equal the thickne&s;s of the wall. Next,
cover this &s;od with loo&s;e earth rounded like a
ridge. Third, prepare thin &s;od, ca&s;t with the
paring &s;pade, &s;ufficiently long for the thickne&s;s of
the wall, and two inches more on each &s;ide.
With the&s;e cover the loo&s;e earth, keeping the
gra&s;&s;y &s;ide uppermo&s;t: place them &s;o much on
edge, as that each &s;od &s;hall cover part of another,
leaving only free two inches above. Fourth,
when twenty or thirty yards are thus fini&s;hed,
let the &s;od be beat with mells by two men, one
on each &s;ide of the wall, &s;triking both at the &s;ame
time. By this operation, the &s;od becomes a com|pact
body, that keeps in the moi&s;ture, and en|courages
the gra&s;s to grow. La&s;tly, cut off the
ragged ends of the &s;od on each &s;ide of the wall,
<PB N="252" REF="278">
to make the covering neat and regular. The
month of October is the proper &s;ea&s;on for this o|peration,
becau&s;e the &s;un and wind, during &s;um|mer,
dries the &s;od, and hindres the gra&s;s from ve|getating.
Moi&s;t &s;oil affords the be&s;t &s;od. Wet
&s;oil is commonly too fat for binding; and at any
rate, the watery plants it produces will not thrive
in a dry &s;ituation. Dry &s;oil, on the other hand,
being commonly ill bound with roots, &s;hakes to
pieces in handling. The ordinary way of coping
with &s;od, which is to lay them flat and &s;ingle,
looks as if intended to dry the coping, and to kill
the gra&s;s; not to mention, that the &s;od is liable
to be blown off the wall by every high wind.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed the wall, ca&s;t a ditch on each
&s;ide, beginning a foot from the root of the wall,
and &s;loping outward to the depth of three feet, or
at lea&s;t two and a half. The ditch &s;hould be e|qually
&s;loped on the other &s;ide, &s;o as to be four
feet wide.</P>
<P>A rood of this fence, including every ar|ticle,
may be done for three &s;hillings or therea|bout;
and a field of ten acres may be thus in|clo&s;ed
for about L. 30. If the ditch be made
three feet deep, the fence will be above &s;ix feet
high; and above L. 20 will be &s;aved of what a
dry-&s;tone wall &s;ix feet high will co&s;t. Nor is this
&s;aving the mo&s;t con&s;iderable article. A fence of
which the parts are &s;o well joined together, will
&s;tand many years with little or no reparation.
<PB N="253" REF="279">
That this is far from being the ca&s;e of a dry-&s;tone
wall &s;ix feet or even five feet high, all the world
know.</P>
<P>Next of thorn-hedges. The advantage of the
white thorn for a fence above every other plant,
is well under&s;tood. It is a quick grower when
planted in proper &s;oil, &s;hooting up &s;ix or &s;even
feet in a &s;ea&s;on. Though tender when young
and hurt by weeds, it turns &s;trong, and may be
cut into any &s;hape. Even when old, it is more
di&s;po&s;ed than other trees to lateral &s;hoots. And,
la&s;tly, its prickles make it the mo&s;t proper of all
for a fence.</P>
<P>The method of &s;owing the &s;eed in beds, is &s;et
forth in the chapter of Fore&s;t-Trees. After the
plants have &s;tood a full year in the &s;eed-bed,
tran&s;plant the large&s;t into a nur&s;ery, which will
leave &s;ufficient room for the remainder, to &s;tand
where they are another year. In the nur&s;ery they
ought to &s;tand at the di&s;tance of &s;even, eight, or
nine inches from each other; and there they may
remain till fit to be planted in a hedge, which is
no &s;ooner than at the age of five. Room in a
nur&s;ery is of great importance: when &s;traitened
for room, the plants &s;hoot up fa&s;t, are weakly,
and unfit to bear the hard&s;hips of an open field.
The di&s;tance ought to be proportioned to the &s;oil;
the greate&s;t in a rich &s;oil, becau&s;e they grow fa&s;t;
the lea&s;t in a poor &s;oil, where they grow &s;low.
The be&s;t &s;oil for a nur&s;ery is between rich and
<PB N="254" REF="280">
poor. In the latter, the plants are dwarfi&s;h: in
the former they are luxuriant and tender, and apt
to be hurt in the &s;everity of weather: and the&s;e
immperfections are incapable of any remedy. An
e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ite in a nur&s;ery is free ventilation.
How common is it to find nur&s;eries in hollow|&s;heltered
places, &s;urrounded with walls and high
plantations, more fit for pine-apples than for bar|ren
trees. The plants thru&s;t out long &s;hoots, but
feeble and tender: when expo&s;ed to a cold &s;itua|tion,
they decay, and &s;ometimes die. But there
is a rea&s;on for every thing: the nu&s;eryman's view
is to make profit by &s;aving ground, and by im|po&s;ing
on the purcha&s;er tall plants, for which he
pretends to demand double price. It is &s;o diffi|cult
to purcha&s;e whole&s;ome and well-nur&s;ed plants,
that every gentleman-farmer ought to rai&s;e plants
for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As thorns will grow plea&s;antly from roots, I
have long practi&s;ed a frugal and expeditious me|thod,
of rai&s;ing them from the wounded roots
that mu&s;t be cut off when thorns are to be &s;et in
a hedge. The&s;e roots cut into &s;mall parts, and put
in a bed of fre&s;h earth, will produce plants the
next &s;pring, no le&s;s vigorous than what are pro|duced
from &s;eed. And thus a perpetual &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
of plants may be obtained without any more
&s;eed.</P>
<P>It ought to be a rule, never to admit into a
hedge plants under five years old: they de&s;erve
<PB N="255" REF="281">
all the additional &s;um that can be demanded for
them. Young and feeble plants in a hedge, are
of &s;low growth; and be&s;ide lo&s;s of time, the pa|ling,
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure them from cattle, mu&s;t
be renewed more than once before they become
a fence.</P>
<P>A thorn-hedge may be planted in every month
of winter and &s;pring, unle&s;s it be fro&s;t. But I
have always ob&s;erved, that thorns planted in Oc|tober
are more healthy, pu&s;h more vigorou&s;ly,
and fewer decay, than at any other time. In
preparing the thorns for planting, the roots
ought to be left as entire as po&s;&s;ible, and nothing
cut away but the ragged parts.</P>
<P>As a thorn-hedge &s;uffers greatly by weeds, the
ground where they are to be planted ought to be
made perfectly clean. The common method of
planting is, to leave eight or nine inches along a
&s;ide of the intended ditch for a &s;car&s;ement; and
behind the &s;car&s;ement to lay the &s;urface-&s;oil of the
intended ditch, cut into &s;quare &s;ods two or three
inches deep, its gra&s;&s;y &s;urface undermo&s;t. Upon
that &s;od, whether clean or dirty, the thorns are
laid, and the earth of the ditch above them. Ac|cording
to that method, the gra&s;s in the &s;car&s;e|ment,
with what weeds are in the moved earth,
&s;oon grow up, and require double diligence to
prevent the young thorns from being choked.
The following method, which is creeping into
practice, de&s;erves all the additional trouble it re|quires.
<PB N="256" REF="282">
Leaving a &s;car&s;ement as above of ten
inches, and al&s;o a border for the thorns, broad
or narrow according to their &s;ize, lay behind the
border all the &s;urface of the intended ditch,
champed &s;mall with the &s;pade, and upon it lay the
mouldery earth that fell from the &s;pade in cutting
the &s;aid &s;urface. Cover the &s;car&s;ement and bor|der
with the under earth, three inches thick at
lea&s;t; laying a little more on the border to rai&s;e
it higher than the &s;car&s;ement, in order to give
room for weeding. After the thorns are prepared,
by &s;moothing their ragged roots with a knife,
and lopping off their heads in order to make them
grow bu&s;hy, they are laid fronting the ditch, with
their roots on the border, the head a little high|er
than the root. Special care mu&s;t be taken
to &s;pread the roots among the &s;urface-earth ta|ken
out of the ditch, and to cover them with the
mouldery earth that lay immediately below. This
article is of importance, becau&s;e the mouldery
earth is the fine&s;t of all. Cover the &s;tems of the
thorns with the next <HI>&s;tratum</HI> of the ditch, lea|ving
always an inch at the top free. It is no
matter how poor this <HI>&s;tratum</HI> be, as the plants
draw no nouri&s;hment from it. Go on to fini&s;h the
ditch, pre&s;&s;ing down carefully every row of earth
thrown up behind the hedge, which makes a &s;o|lid
mound impervious to rain. It is a &s;afeguard
to the young hedge to rai&s;e this mound as perpen|dicular
as po&s;&s;ible; and for that end it may be
<PB N="257" REF="283">
proper in loo&s;e &s;oil, when the mound is rai&s;ed a
foot or &s;o, to bind it with a row of the tough &s;od,
which will &s;upport the earth above, till it become
&s;olid by lying.</P>
<P>This is &s;ufficient in rich &s;oil; but where the
&s;oil is not rich, greater care is nece&s;&s;ary. Behind
the line of the ditch, the ground intended for the
&s;carcement and border &s;hould be &s;ummer-fallow|ed,
manured, and cleared of all gra&s;s-roots; and
this culture will make up for the inferiority of
&s;oil. In very poor &s;oil it is vain to think of plant|ing
a thorn-hedge; for it will give no &s;atisfaction,
becau&s;e it never will become a fence. In &s;uch
ground there is a nece&s;&s;ity for a &s;tone fence.</P>
<P>The only rea&s;on that can be given for laying
thorns as above de&s;cribed, is to give the roots
&s;pace to pu&s;h in all directions, even upward into
the mound of earth. There may be &s;ome advan|tage
in this; but, in my apprehen&s;ion, the di&s;|advantage
is much greater of heaping &s;o much
earth on the roots, as to exclude not only the &s;un
and air, but even rain, which runs down the &s;lop|ing
bank, and has no acce&s;s to the roots. In|&s;tead
of laying the thorns fronting the ditch,
would it not do better to lay them paralled to the
ditch; covering the roots with three or four
inches of the be&s;t earth, which would make a
hollow between the plants and the &s;loping bank?
This hollow would intercept every drop of rain
that falls on the bank, to &s;ink gradually among
<PB N="258" REF="284">
the roots. If this be not a better po&s;ition for a
thorn, it mu&s;t be of a &s;ingular con&s;titution. I
venture one &s;tep farther out of the common path.
Why at any rate &s;hould a thorn be put in the
ground &s;loping? This is not the practice with
re&s;pect to any other tree; and I have heard of no
experiment to per&s;uade me that a thorn thrives
better &s;loping than erect. But as in natural hi|&s;tory
experiment is always our la&s;t re&s;ource, I am
at pre&s;ent following out a comparative trial. I
have many young hedges in the way fir&s;t de&s;cri|bed:
&s;ome I have laid parallel to the ditch in the
way now de&s;cribed, and &s;ome I have planted e|rect
with their tops entire. The trials are fairly
made; and time will determine the be&s;t method.</P>
<P>In a rich &s;oil the thorns may be planted ten
inches a&s;under; and from that to &s;ix inches in
inferior &s;oils. To pre&s;erve them from cattle, the
ditch ought to be &s;ix feet wide, three feet deep,
and as narrow at bottom as the breadth of the
&s;pade will allow. But when the thorns are &s;uf|ficiently
covered, the prudent way is to delay fi|ni&s;hing
the ditch till the fro&s;t be over. Spring is
the proper time for completing the work, while
there is &s;ufficient &s;ap in the &s;oil, to bind the
mound of earth that is rai&s;ed behind the thorns.
If delayed till the earth be dry, it never binds: if
completed the beginning of winter, fro&s;t &s;wells
the earth, loo&s;ens it, and makes it crumble
down.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="285">
The hedge is fenced from cattle on the one &s;ide
by the ditch; but it is nece&s;&s;ary that it be fenced
on both &s;ides. The ordinary method of a paleing
is no &s;ufficient fence again&s;t cattle: the mo&s;t
gentle make it a rubbing-po&s;t; and the vitious
break it down wantonly with their horns. The
only effectual remedy is expen&s;ive; but better no
fence than one that is imperfect. The remedy is,
two ditches and two hedges, with a high mound
of earth between them. Survey Scotland, and
you will not find any fences otherwi&s;e con&s;tructed
without many breaches; the repairing of which
gives much trouble and little &s;atisfaction. If this
remedy however be not palatable, the paleing
ought at lea&s;t to be of the &s;tronge&s;t kind. Many
different kinds have been put in practice, that
are extremely frail. I recommend the following,
as the be&s;t I am acquainted with. Drive into
the ground &s;trong &s;takes three feet and a half
long, with intervals from eight to twelve inches,
according to the &s;ize of the cattle that are to be
enclo&s;ed; and all preci&s;ely of the &s;ame height.
Prepare plates of wood &s;awed out of logs, every
plate three inches broad and half an inch thick.
Fix them on the head of the &s;takes, with a nail
driven down into each &s;take. The &s;takes will be
united &s;o firmly, that one cannot be moved with|out
the whole; and will be proof accordingly a|gain&s;t
the rubbing of cattle. But, after all, it is
no fence again&s;t vitious cattle. The only proper
<PB N="260" REF="286">
place for it is the &s;ide of a high-road, or to fence
a plantation of trees. It will indeed be a &s;ufficient
fence again&s;t &s;heep, and endure till the hedge it|&s;elf
be a fence. A fence thus completed, inclu|ding
thorns, ditching, wood, nails, &amp;c. will not
much exceed two &s;hillings every &s;ix yards.</P>
<P>We are now arrived at the mo&s;t important ar|ticle
of all, that of training up a thorn-hedge after
it is planted. The ordinary method is, to cut off
the top, and &s;horten the lateral branches, in or|der
to make it thick and bu&s;hy. To the &s;ame
end, the young thorns, after &s;tanding &s;ix or &s;even
years, are &s;ometimes cut over within two or three
inches of the ground, which multiplies the &s;tems,
and makes the hedges &s;till thicker. This form of
a hedge catches the eye: by its thickne&s;s it is for|midable
to cattle; but its weakne&s;s is di&s;covered
when bare of leaves, and cattle break through e|very
where without ob&s;truction.</P>
<P>I have the experience of three hedges trained
for twelve years as follows. The fir&s;t has been
annually pruned top and &s;ides. The &s;ides of the
&s;econd have been pruned, but the top left entire.
The third was allowed to grow without any pru|ning.
The fir&s;t is at pre&s;ent about four feet
b$oad and thick from top to bottom; but weak in
its &s;tems, and unable to re&s;i&s;t any horned bea&s;t.
The &s;econd is &s;trong in its &s;tems, and clo&s;e from
top to bottom. The third is al&s;o &s;trong in its
&s;tems, but for two feet up bare of lateral branches,
<PB N="261" REF="287">
which have been de&s;troyed by the over&s;hadowing
of tho&s;e above, depriving them both of rain and
air. That the &s;econd is the be&s;t method, is a&s;|certained
by experience. And that it ought to
be &s;o, will be evident if we can tru&s;t to analogy.
In the natural growth of a tree, its trunk is pro|portioned
to its height: lop off the head, it &s;preads
laterally and becomes a bu&s;h, without ri&s;ing in
height, or &s;welling in the trunk. The lime-tree is
the only exception I know: the white thorn I am
certain is not an exception. Hence the following
method of training up a hedge, which is to allow
the thorns to grow without applying a knife to
their tops, till their &s;tems be &s;ive or &s;ix inches in
circumference. In good &s;oil, with careful weed|ing,
they will be of that bulk in ten or twelve
years, and be fifteen feet high or upward. The
lateral branches only mu&s;t be attended to. Tho&s;e
next the ground mu&s;t be pruned within two feet
of the &s;tem: tho&s;e above mu&s;t be made &s;horter
and &s;horter, in proportion to their di&s;tance from
the ground; and at five feet high they mu&s;t be
cut clo&s;e to the &s;tem, leaving all above full free|dom
of growth. By this dre&s;&s;ing, the hedge
takes on the appearance of a very &s;teep roof; and
it ought to be kept in that form by pruning. This
form gives free acce&s;s to rain, &s;un, and air: e|very
twig has its &s;hare, and the whole is pre&s;erved
in vigour. When the &s;tems have arrived at their
proper bulk, cut over them at five feet from
<PB N="262" REF="288">
the ground, where the lateral branches end. This
an&s;wers two excellent purpo&s;es; the fir&s;t is, to
&s;trengthen the hedge, the &s;ap that formerly a|&s;cended
to the top being now di&s;tributed among
the branches. The next is, that a tall hedge
&s;tagnates the air, and poi&s;ons both corn and gra&s;s
near it. A hedge trained up in this manner, is
impenetrable even by a bull: he may pre&s;s in the
lateral branches; but the &s;tems &s;tand firm. For
an in&s;tant proof that this method will an&s;wer, ob|&s;erve
the thorns that from &s;pace to &s;pace are al|lowed
to grow up above their fellows, in form of
a hedge-row. The&s;e thorns, though growing in
the middle of a bu&s;hy hedge, have &s;tems far lar|ger
than the re&s;t. Be&s;ide the &s;trength of &s;uch a
hedge, it is le&s;s expen&s;ive than a hedge reared in
the ordinary way: the weeds are &s;ooner choaked;
and it requires much le&s;s pruning. When &s;o much
labour is &s;aved, one will the le&s;s grudge the price
of the be&s;t thorns that can be procured. Good
thorns are indeed more e&s;&s;ential in this manner of
training up a hedge than in any other: they ought
all to be of an equal &s;ize, and equally vigorous,
that they may not overtop one another. The in|termixing
of &s;trong and weak plants is of le&s;s im|portance,
where the heads are cut off and all made
to grow equally.</P>
<P>Pla&s;hing an old hedge, an ordinary practice in
England, makes indeed a good interim fence;
but at the long-run is de&s;tructive to the hedge:
<PB N="263" REF="289">
and accordingly, there is &s;carce to be met with a
complete good hedge where pla&s;hing has been
long practi&s;ed. A cat is &s;aid among the vulgar to
have nine lives: is it their opinion, that a thorn,
like a cat, may be cut and &s;la&s;hed at will without
&s;uffering by it? Lucky it is, that the method
here recommended renders pla&s;hing altogether
unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>A hedge ought never to be planted on the top
of the mound of earth thrown up from the ditch.
It has indeed the advantage of an awful &s;ituation;
but being planted in bad foil, and de&s;titute of moi|&s;ture,
it cannot thrive: it is at be&s;t dwarfi&s;h, and
frequently decays and dies.</P>
<P>To plant trees in the line of the hedge, or with|in
a few feet of it, ought to be ab&s;olutely prohi|bited,
as a heterodox practice. It is amazing,
that people &s;hould fall into this error, when they
ought to know, that there never was a good
thorn-hedge with trees in it. And how &s;hould it
be otherwi&s;e? an oak, a beech, an elm, grows
fa&s;ter than a thorn: when &s;uffered to grow in the
mid&s;t of a thorn-hedge, it &s;preads its roots every
where, and robs the thorns of their nouri&s;hment.
Nor is this all: the tree over&s;hadowing the
thorns keeps the &s;un and air from them. At the
&s;ame time, no tree takes wor&s;e with being over|&s;hadowed
than a thorn.</P>
<P>It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to mention gaps in a
hedge; becau&s;e they will &s;eldom happen where a
<PB N="264" REF="290">
hedge is trained up as above recommended. But
in the ordinary method of training, gaps are fre|quent,
partly by the failure of plants, and partly
by the tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing of cattle. The ordinary me|thod
of making up gaps is, to plant &s;weet brier
where the gap is &s;mall, and a crab where it
its larger. This method I cannot approve, for
an obvious rea&s;on: a hedge ought never to
be compo&s;ed of plants that grow unequally:
tho&s;e that grow fa&s;t overtop and hurt the &s;low
growers; and with re&s;pect in particular to a crab
and &s;weet brier, neither of them thrive under
&s;hade. It is a better method to remove all the
withered earth in the gap, and to &s;ub&s;titute fre&s;h
&s;appy mould mixed with &s;ome lime or dung.
Plant upon it a vigorous thorn of equal height
with the hedge, which in its growth will equal
the thorns it is mixed with. In that view, there
&s;hould be a nur&s;ery of thorns of all &s;izes, even to
five feet high, ready to fill up gaps. The be&s;t
&s;ea&s;on for this operation is the month of October.
I &s;hould have added, that a gap filled with &s;weet
brier, or a crab lower than the hedge, invites
cattle to break through and trample the young
plants under foot; to prevent which a paleing on
both &s;ides is far from being &s;ufficient, unle&s;s it be
rai&s;ed as high as the hedge.</P>
<P>Nothing hitherto has been &s;aid about an inclo|&s;ure
for &s;heep. To carry a farm to its perfection,
every inclo&s;ure ought to be made &s;o as to keep in
<PB N="265" REF="291">
&s;heep, though not chiefly intended for them; for
&s;heep ought to be mixed with other cattle in e|very
pa&s;ture-field: they eat what others leave,
and others eat what they leave. But farmers ge|nerally
take a humbler flight, and are &s;atisfied with
one or two inclo&s;ures for &s;heep. In that view I
premi&s;e, that of all animals &s;heep naturally take
the wide&s;t range in feeding; for which rea&s;on, an
inclo&s;ure for them ought never to be under fifty
or &s;ixty acres. Where they have &s;o much room,
any fence will keep them in: where confined to
five, &s;ix, or even ten acres, the mo&s;t awful fence
is &s;carce &s;ufficient. I talk of the common run of
&s;heep; not of the large Lincoln&s;hire breed, habi|tuated
to inclo&s;ures, which have no genius for
leaping.</P>
<P>Where &s;tones are to be had, the cheape&s;t and
mo&s;t effectual is the &s;tone fence above de&s;cribed.
If a farm cannot afford an inclo&s;ure &s;o large as
that now mentioned, the deepne&s;s of the ditch
ought to be in a reciptocal proportion to the &s;ize
of the inclo&s;ure: in a &s;mall inclo&s;ure, the fence
ought at lea&s;t to be &s;ix feet high. If the farmer
be reduced to a quick&s;et hedge by want of &s;tones,
the &s;car&s;ement mu&s;t be eighteen inches broad, in
order to receive a paleing between the root of the
hedge and lip of the ditch; inclining to the ditch
in form of a &s;tocade, which will make it the more
awful. This will fit the inclo&s;ure immediately
for &s;heep, without waiting the &s;low growth of the
<PB N="266" REF="292">
hedge. When the paleing fails, the ditch mu&s;t
be lined up with &s;tones to the height of the
hedge, to prevent the &s;heep from making a road
up the &s;ide of the ditch to come at the thorns;
which would ruin all, for no food is &s;o palatable
to them as the leaves of thorn. Where &s;tones are
&s;carce, two feet of &s;tones may do, rai&s;ing the li|ning
to the height of the thorns with &s;od.</P>
<P>One thing is never to be omitted in a large in|clo&s;ure.
Sheep require a &s;helter again&s;t heat, no
le&s;s than again&s;t cold. The &s;tone fence recom|mended,
affords little &s;helter again&s;t either. There|fore,
a &s;helter ought to be made &s;omewhere in the
drie&s;t part of the field. Plant ten or twelve rows
of Scotch fir or &s;pruce fir in a curve, &s;emicircular,
or eliptical, the concave fronting the &s;outh, and
&s;ufficiently capacious for beds to all the &s;heep.
Surround this plantation with a &s;tone fence of the
&s;ame form with what inclo&s;es the field. The
weake&s;t trees ought to be weeded out from time
to time, which will give the trees that &s;tand room
to extend their lateral branches. And the plan|tation
when grown up will protect the &s;heep from
all cold or fierce winds. The dung dropt in this
&s;heltered place, may be gathered and put in a
dunghill, or &s;pred upon the field.</P>
<P>A &s;heep yields more profit by pa&s;ture than any
other animal; and as its dung enriches the &s;oil
more, I mu&s;t repeat again, that a provident far|mer
ought to have more enclo&s;ures than one: he
<PB N="267" REF="293">
will have the benefit of fine crops of corn by re|moving
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;heep from on$ inclo&s;ure to
another.</P>
<P>A word more before I end, which &s;hall be on
the gates of inclo&s;ures. The po&s;ts upon which the
gate is hung, though built of &s;tone and lime, is
apt to be &s;haken by a heavy gate, and to be torn
to pieces by a carele&s;s driver running the axle of
his cart again&s;t it. But in&s;tead of building a wall
in the line of the inclo&s;ure, let it be built perpen|dicular
to it, &s;even or eight feet long, thicke&s;t in
the middle and tapering toward the ends. Such
a wall or po&s;t will be proof again&s;t any force.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">THE PROPER SIZE OF A FARM, AND THE
USEFUL ACCOMMODATIONS IT OUGHT
TO HAVE.</HEAD>
<P>TO confine a tenant to that quantity of land
which can be managed to the be&s;t purpo&s;e
with the lea&s;t expence, is the &s;ure&s;t means of ob|taining
an adequate rent without oppre&s;&s;ion. A
farm ought never to contain a le&s;s quantity of
land than &s;ufficient for a plough; and there is no
medium between that quantity, and as much as
will give full employment to two. Le&s;s than &s;uf|ficient
for a plough, is an evident lo&s;s to the te|nant,
<PB N="268" REF="294">
and con&s;equently to the landlord: the &s;er|vants
and cattle mu&s;t at times be idle for want of
work; or what is wor&s;e, they will work indolent|ly,
and make no progre&s;s. I have a &s;triking proof
of this ob&s;ervation. The e&s;tate of Grange in the
car&s;e of Falkirk, containing about 360 Scotch
acres, paid of rent L. 450. It was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by
no fewer than eleven tenants; not one of the
farms &s;ufficient for a plough, &s;everal of them be|tween
twenty and thirty acres. A map was made:
it was clearly &s;een, that the e&s;tate could hold but
&s;ix tenants; and it luckily happened, that there
were &s;ix hou&s;es abundantly centrical for the&s;e te|nants,
without nece&s;&s;ity of new buildings. The
&s;aving of twenty hor&s;es and ten &s;ervants, and the
maintainance of five tenants and their families,
was great; be&s;ide the profit that each tenant was
intitled to for his &s;kill and labour. The &s;ix tenants
that took the whole offered at once an advance of
L. 194 Sterling, which was accepted, though not
equal to the &s;aving. And accordingly the pre|&s;ent
rent of L. 644 will be ea&s;ier on the &s;ix te|nants,
than the former rent of L. 450 was on the
eleven. A farm, on the other hand, that cannot
be commanded by one plough, and is not &s;uffi|cient
for two, is a &s;till greater lo&s;s. The tenant,
&s;truggling to make &s;omething of every field, does
ju&s;tice to no field; and the farm turns poorer and
poorer every year. It is well known, that mo&s;t
farms in Scotland are too large for the ability of
<PB N="269" REF="295">
the tenant. The rea&s;on is, that in an uncultiva|ted
country, the adding twenty or thirty acres
more is little regarded. I could give many in|&s;tances
of a tenant beginning to thrive after being
deprived of part of his farm. But it is unnece&s;|&s;ary
to give in&s;tances, for they are known every
where.</P>
<P>When one thinks of calculating what quantity
of land is &s;ufficient for a &s;ingle plough, many cir|cum&s;tances
occur, that make it impracticable to
determine the point with any preci&s;ion. The
difference between a light and a heavy &s;oil, is con|&s;iderable;
and no le&s;s &s;o, the nearne&s;s or di&s;tance
of manure. The mode of cropping is capital:
where all the different plants are &s;own in &s;pring
and reaped in autumn, more ploughs are requi|&s;ite
than when crops are di&s;per&s;ed through the
year, according to the pre&s;ent improved mode of
culture. I venture only in general to &s;ay, that
in mo&s;t &s;oils fifty acres of corn may be command|ed
by a &s;ingle plough, provided the crops be di&s;|tributed
through the year, to afford time for ma|naging
all of them with the &s;ame men and cattle.
But where gra&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary for keeping the &s;oil
in heart, a farm ought to be enlarged in propor|tion
to the quantity of gra&s;s required; for there
ought always to be as much land in tillage as fully
to occupy a plough. If a third part in gra&s;s be
&s;ufficient, the farm ought to con&s;i&s;t of &s;eventy-five
acres: if a half be nece&s;&s;ary, the farm ought to
<PB N="270" REF="296">
be 100 acres; and if the &s;oil be &s;o mean as to re|quire
two thirds in gra&s;s, the extent of the farm
ought to be 150 acres. If the reader be curious
about further particulars, I refer him to the &s;e|venth
chapter, in which a few examples are gi|ven
of the number of acres that in different modes
of cropping may be commanded by one plough.
The&s;e examples will pave the way to computations
corre&s;ponding to other rotations.</P>
<P>I proceed to an intere&s;ting article, which is to
compare great and &s;mall farms in point of utility.
I call a &s;mall farm what employs but a &s;ingle
plough; and a &s;maller there ought not to be. A
middling farm is what requires two ploughs; and
whatever requires a greater number, I call a great
farm. The&s;e different farms I &s;hall con&s;ider with
re&s;pect to the landlord, with re&s;pect to the tenant,
and with re&s;pect to the public.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the landlord, there are advan|tages
and di&s;advantages that tend to balance each
other. Small farms draw the greate&s;t number of
candidates; which cannot fail to rai&s;e the rents.
On the other hands, &s;mall farms occa&s;ion a great
expence for hou&s;es; and in a country where build|ing
materials are co&s;tly, large farms may appear
to be the intere&s;t of the landlord.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to tenants, a farm as large as can
accurately be managed, is undoubtedly the in|tere&s;t
of a tenant, provided he have a fund for
&s;tocking the farm &s;ufficiently. But this is really
<PB N="271" REF="297">
&s;aying no more, but that it is beneficial to have a
large fund. The proper que&s;tion is, Whether
with re&s;pect to farmers in general, it is not a con|venience
to have the choice of &s;mall or great farms,
according to their &s;tock? In that view, &s;mall
farms are undoubtedly advantageous to tho&s;e
who want to be farmers; becau&s;e in Scotland, at
lea&s;t, the number is much greater of tho&s;e who
can &s;tock a &s;mall farm, than of tho&s;e who can go
farther. It may po&s;&s;ibly be objected, that there
is an inconvenience in a &s;mall farm where two
hor&s;es only are nece&s;&s;ary for a plough, in re&s;pect
that two hor&s;es make but a &s;low progre&s;s in carry|ing
corn or dung. To this objection there is a
ready an&s;wer: two hor&s;es in two &s;ingle carts will
make as much expedition in carrying out the
dung, or carrying in the corn of a &s;mall farm, as
double that number will make in a middling farm,
where the dung and corn are double in quantity.
I &s;ay further, that if two hor&s;es be not &s;ufficient,
the defect may be readily &s;upplied by two draught
oxen, which add very little to the expence of the
farm. The&s;e at four years of age may be pur|cha&s;ed
for L. 10. They will give at &s;even L. 15;
and this profit, with no more work than &s;ufficient
to give them a &s;tomach, will balance their &s;um|mer-food
of green clover. Their winter-food of
&s;traw cannot enter into the computation, being
the very be&s;t way of converting &s;traw into dung.
Here there is a great convenience. Where a
<PB N="272" REF="298">
field, by drought or otherwi&s;e, is rendered too
&s;tiff for a pair, the oxen may be yoked in the
plough with the hor&s;es. In ground le&s;s &s;tiff, the
farmer has a choice of two oxen and a hor&s;e, of
two hor&s;es alone, or of two oxen. Where
ploughing happens to be retarded by bad weather,
two ploughs may be employed, which is a &s;ignal
convenience. Ploughing al&s;o and harrowing may
go on at the &s;ame time; and the farmer has it al|ways
in his power to yoke two double carts. Even
in car&s;e-&s;oil this plan will an&s;wer; as there is &s;el|dom
occa&s;ion to employ the oxen but where the
ground is &s;ufficiently dry for them.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the public, &s;mall farms are un|doubtedly
the mo&s;t advantageous. The number
of &s;ervants, it is true, mu&s;t be in proportion to
the &s;ize of the farm: but in a middling farm there
is but one tenant; whereas in two &s;mall farms of
no greater extent, there are two. And the dif|ference
is &s;till greater in large farms. This is a
capital circum&s;tance. The children of tenants are
taught to read and write; and in general are bet|ter
educated than children of day-labourers, which
qualifies them better for being arti&s;ts and manu|facturers.
They are al&s;o commonly more nume|rous,
being better nouri&s;hed during nonage, and
better pre&s;erved from di&s;ea&s;es. Small farms ac|cordingly
are not only favourable to population,
but to the mo&s;t u&s;eful population. I would not
therefore indulge willingly any farm beyond a
<PB N="273" REF="299">
middle &s;ize. And to check tho&s;e of a larger &s;ize,
I am clear for a tax of L. 3 or L. 4 yearly upon
every farm that requires three ploughs; and &s;o
on according to the number. I except proprietors,
who ought to be encouraged to improve their e|&s;tates:
let them employ as many ploughs as they
find convenient, and not be &s;ubjected to any tax.
If any undertaker be willing to lay out a large
&s;um of money upon farming, the profit of a long
lea&s;e will enable him to pay the tax. This tax at
the &s;ame time may be &s;o contrived, as to an&s;wer
a valuable purpo&s;e, that of exciting farmers to
u&s;e oxen in&s;tead of hor&s;es; which will be done by
exempting oxen-ploughs from the tax. And the
undertaker mentioned will be relieved from the
tax altogether, if he employ &s;uch ploughs only.</P>
<P>THE &s;ize of a farm being adju&s;ted, next in or|der
are its accommodations. The fir&s;t accom|modation
I &s;hall mention is, an acre planted with
trees proper for the farm; fir in particular and
a&s;h. The wor&s;t &s;oil will an&s;wer the former, and
moi&s;t &s;oil the latter. The&s;e are at hand for pale|ing
and other purpo&s;es; and without &s;uch a con|venience
a tenant's hands are in a mea&s;ure bound
up.</P>
<P>Another accommodation follows. However well
adju&s;ted the &s;ize of a farm may be to the &s;trength
employed upon it; yet to have a farm in perfection
there ought always to be &s;ome bywork, about
<PB N="274" REF="300">
which the &s;ervants and hor&s;es may be employed,
when the ordinary culture of the farm does not
require them. There is a great difference be|tween
good and bad weather, with re&s;pect to ex|pedition.
The farmer mu&s;t provide again&s;t the
latter, by &s;ufficiency of men and hor&s;es, which in
the former have not full employment. Therefore,
to provide again&s;t want of work, there ought to
be a re&s;ource, &s;uch as may be taken up or laid
down as occa&s;ion offers. The carrying lime to a
farm, or marl, or dung from a neighbouring
town, are excellent re&s;ources.</P>
<P>The chief accommodation of all is, a fruitful
kitchen-garden. Formerly, oat-meal was the only
food of our labouring people; and when at five
or &s;ix &s;hillings per boll, there could not be cheap|er
food. A kitchen-garden was at that time a
&s;ort of luxury, and our &s;imple pea&s;ants had no
notion of luxury. By a great advance in the price
of oats and oat-meal, a kitchen-garden has be|come
an article of economy; and yet &s;carce more
attended to than formerly. Well dreffed and crop|ed,
it will afford half maintenance to a family;
and will not co&s;t the half of oat-meal. But the
ignorant are &s;laves to cu&s;tom; and no value is put
on a kitchen-garden at pre&s;ent, becau&s;e it was of
no value thirty years ago.</P>
<P>The extent of this garden depends on the man|ner
of croping the farm. Where red clover is
one of the crops in the rotation, a kitchen-garden
<PB N="275" REF="301">
need not exceed two or three acres. Where red
clover enters not into the rotation, &s;ix acres are
the &s;malle&s;t quantity even for a &s;ingle plough;
becau&s;e it mu&s;t yield food both for man and bea&s;t.
Take the following rotation, which at the &s;ame
time is capable of greater variety in a kitchen|garden
of greater extent than &s;ix acres. Two
acres are nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ummer-food to the farm|cattle,
cows, &amp;c. Two acres more will be u&s;e|fully
employed in cabbage, colewort, turnip, car|rot,
potatoes, leeks, onions, turky-beans, white
pea&s;e, and other kitchen-&s;tuff, for food to the fa|mily.
The remaining two acres mu&s;t be &s;own
with barley and red clover. To give directions
for the culture of the vegetables intended for the
family u&s;e, would be a treati&s;e on the kitchen|garden.
I &s;hall only &s;lightly ob&s;erve, that the early
cabbage, termed <HI>May cabbage,</HI> may be &s;et the
end of February, or as &s;oon after as the &s;ea&s;on
an&s;wers; and will be ready for eating in May
and June. Scotch cabbage ought to be &s;et in
March; and a few &s;et in June will be ready for
eating next &s;pring. The &s;ea&s;on for &s;owing car|rots,
onions, and leeks, is the &s;ame with that of
oats. Onions require a rich &s;oil; and if that be
wanting, leeks may &s;upply their place. Potatoes
ought never to be neglected: they make a hearty
food, and the cheape&s;t of all: upon which ac|count,
as many ought to be rai&s;ed as will &s;erve
the family the year round. Turnip is proper for
<PB N="276" REF="302">
cows after calving; and to turnip may be added
what cabbage or colewort are &s;aved from the fa|mily-u&s;e.
This &s;ucculent food will produce plenty
of milk for rearing calves, an article little regard|ed
in Scotland. Careful culture may afford &s;ome
re&s;idue for feeding an old cow or ox during win|ter;
which in &s;pring may be &s;old to great advan|tage,
in&s;tead of being &s;old the beginning of win|ter
for a trifle.</P>
<P>A kitchen-garden is always &s;urrounded with
trees, from the notion that it requires &s;helter.
Young plants require &s;helter; but not tho&s;e that
are advanced in growth. Plants long &s;heltered in
a kitchen-garden, are too tender for the field.
And for evidence that they pro&s;per greatly by a
free circulation of air, they ri&s;e in the field to a
much greater &s;ize than in a &s;heltered garden. I
need &s;carce add, that the kitchen-garden ought
to be as near the farm-hou&s;es as may be, in order
to &s;ave the carriage of dung to it, and of green
food to the cattle.</P>
<P>There is one accommodation of a farm I reli&s;h
greatly, becau&s;e it has a charitable view. Why
not re&s;erve work for &s;uperannuated labourers that
requires little &s;trength, cutting down weeds for
example, weeding hedges, filling up ruts in a
road with &s;mall &s;tones, tending cattle in the hou&s;e
during winter, gathering dung, and &s;uch like?
Half-pay would help them to live; and gentle
work would keep them in &s;pirits, preventing a
<PB N="277" REF="303">
langour that &s;its down heavy on the indu&s;trious,
when reduced to idlene&s;s.</P>
<P>It will not be an unnece&s;&s;ary addition, to exa|mine
what &s;ort of farm is proper for a wright, a
&s;mith, a ma&s;on, or a weaver. A mechanic, it is
true, makes more by his art than by hu&s;bandry-work:
but if he have no farm to depend on, he
mu&s;t go far to market for provi&s;ions, and will be
ill provided after all. At any rate, he mu&s;t have
a &s;mall farm for maintaining a hor&s;e and two
cows: the former for carrying timber, iron, coals,
&amp;c.; the latter for milk.</P>
<P>The quantity of land nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upplying all
his wants, cannot be le&s;s than &s;ix acres where the
&s;oil is good, and more where it is indifferent. To
prevent the expence of winter-herding, the field
mu&s;t be inclo&s;ed; but divi&s;ions are not nece&s;&s;ary.
It ought to be cropped as follows: a third part in
red clover, with a &s;mall proportion of ryegra&s;s to
thicken the crop: a third part in oats, turnip, and
potatoes; the remaining third in barley and lint;
the lint to be &s;own where the potatoes grew the
former year.</P>
<P>To &s;ave the expence and trouble of carrying
clover to the cattle in the hou&s;e, and of carrying
dung to the field, let a moveable trough be pro|vided
twelve feet long, the &s;ide &s;pars eighteen
inches high. Bind the hor&s;e and two cows to
&s;takes at the &s;ide of the trough, and let them have
plenty of clover. To defend them from heat and
<PB N="278" REF="304">
from flies, cover them with a &s;hed, the roof of
which may be an old &s;ail, or any other coar&s;e
cloth, &s;upported upon wooden pillars. The trough
and &s;hed moved from place to place, will &s;pread
the dung equally, and &s;ave carriage of the clover.
The wife or maid-&s;ervant, when &s;he milks the
cows, fills the trough with clover; and the rich|ne&s;s
of the food will make it proper to milk them
thrice a-day. The oat and barley crops need no
in&s;truction. The turnip is an excellent food for
the cows in &s;pring after calving; and there ought
to be as many potatoes as to &s;erve the family the
year round. As for the flax, all the ground that
can po&s;&s;ibly be &s;pared ought to be cropped with
it; becau&s;e every per&s;on of the family may be
profitably employed, upon dre&s;&s;ing it in winter-evenings
when no other work is on hand, and
when otherwi&s;e they would be idle.</P>
<P>The oat and barley &s;traw, with what clover has
been &s;aved, will &s;uffice for winter-food to the
hor&s;e and two cows. And the dung that can be
thus gathered, will &s;uffice for the turnip and potato
crops. As the lint &s;ucceeds the potato-crop, it
will require no dung.</P>
<P>The great lo&s;s of a &s;mall farm that cannot main|tain
a plough is, that the land is never dre&s;&s;ed in
&s;ea&s;on. No neighbouring farmer will part with
his plough, even for hire, till his own work be
fini&s;hed. This lo&s;s may be prevented by placing
two mechanics together. If good-natured and &s;o|ciable,
<PB N="279" REF="305">
they will go on plea&s;antly with their two
hor&s;es in a plough, and will have always the &s;ea|&s;on
at command for ploughing. The great ad|vantage
of &s;uch a plan, both for frugality and pro|fit,
will &s;ubdue even bad humour, and make the
neighbours go on cordially together.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to a weaver, &s;ome Iri&s;h pamphlets
declare again&s;t his having any land to cultivate;
for the rea&s;on above mentioned, that there is
more profit by weaving than by farming. But
this rea&s;on is not &s;atisfactory. Weaving, a &s;eden|tary
occupation, requires at times field-labour for
&s;ake of health; and it is not con&s;i&s;tent with hu|manity,
that profit only &s;hould be the object, with|out
regard to health or comfort. It may at the
&s;ame time be doubted, whether it will not be pro|fitable
to pre&s;erve a weaver a few years longer in
health and vigour. The&s;e con&s;iderations mu&s;t
weigh, even where there is a market at hand for
provi&s;ions, which is a rare ca&s;e in Scotland. But
as a weaver has no occa&s;ion for a hor&s;e, four acres
are &s;ufficient for his purpo&s;e, to be cropped in
three divi&s;ions as above mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WHAT A CORN-FARM OUGHT TO YIELD
IN RENT.</HEAD>
<P>IN lea&s;ing a farm, it appears an equitable bar|gain,
that after a moderate allowance to the
tenant for his &s;kill and indu&s;try, and after deduct|ing
the expence of management, the remainder
of the product, or its value in money, ought to go
to the landlord as rent. In order then to a&s;cer|tain
the rent of a farm, the particulars mu&s;t be
&s;tated with which the crop ought to be burdened.
This will be found not an ea&s;y ta&s;k: but the fol|lowing
con&s;iderations, will pave the way to it.</P>
<P>The labour be&s;towed on dre&s;&s;ing land for a
crop, is evidently a burden on the crop. But by
what rule is that labour to be e&s;timated? If the
labour of every man and every hor&s;e were to be
&s;tated at &s;o much per day, it would encourage the
tenant to loiter, in&s;tead of being diligent; the
crop would be exhau&s;ted by the expence, and no|thing
be left to the landlord. The nature of the
agreement between landlord and tenant, &s;ugge&s;ts
a more proper method of &s;tating the account.
The tenant furni&s;hes the &s;ervants and cattle; but
as they labour for the landlord, the expence mu&s;t
be defrayed by him. The article for &s;ervants hi|red
by the year or half-year, is &s;imple: their wages
<PB N="281" REF="307">
mu&s;t be &s;tated as a burden on the product. The
article for the labouring cattle is more intricate.
Were the price of every bea&s;t to be &s;tated, bought
by the tenant during his lea&s;e in place of tho&s;e
that fail, it would occa&s;ion much trouble, and o|pen
a door to fraud. The only practicable way,
is to allow the tenant a yearly &s;um, for the u&s;e
of his cattle, and for upholding them. For the
former he cannot be offered le&s;s than five <HI>per
cent.;</HI> becau&s;e that &s;um he would be intitled to,
upon converting his &s;tocking into money. As to
the latter, cattle are a peri&s;hable commodity; and
every farmer reckons upon the expence of re|newing
his &s;tock every ten years. To an&s;wer this
expence, the tenant ought to be allowed yearly ten
<HI>per cent.</HI> of the value of his &s;tock; which &s;um in
ten years amounts to no more but that value. But
this is not all: a poor tenant who commonly has
nothing to depend on but his &s;tock, mu&s;t be pre|&s;erved
from ri&s;k. His &s;tock of labouring cattle
ought to be in&s;ured to him; and the in&s;urance
cannot well be yearly under four or five <HI>per cent.</HI>
Upon the whole, for furni&s;hing labouring cattle,
and upholding them, he is well intitled to twenty
<HI>per cent.</HI> yearly of their value; and this &s;um is
another deduction from the yearly product.</P>
<P>In this account mu&s;t al&s;o be comprehended the
farm-in&s;truments, ploughs, carts, &amp;c.; for the&s;e
mu&s;t be renewed from time to time, &s;till more
frequently than the labouring cattle. But cows
<PB N="282" REF="308">
and calves, and other particulars that are kept for
the benefit of the tenant &s;olely, are not to be com|prehended;
becau&s;e they produce nothing to the
landlord.</P>
<P>What the tenant him&s;elf ought to be allowed
out of the product, for be&s;towing his whole time
upon the &s;ervice of his landlord, is far from being
obvious. A tenant is in a higher cla&s;s than a
hired &s;ervant or day-labourer; and may well rank
with a &s;hopkeeper in a town, or a manufacturer
in a village. To judge by that compari&s;on, his
allowance ought not to be under L. 36 or L. 40
yearly; &s;uppo&s;ing the corn, one grain with an|other,
to give ten &s;hillings per boll, which is the
price to be under&s;tood in every branch of this in|quiry.
Nor is this a high allowance, con&s;idering
that after maintenance of the family, and educa|tion
of the children, very little will be &s;aved. But
here nature &s;trikes out again&s;t this allowance.
Men are ambitious of power, the lower cla&s;&s;es not
excepted. Every day-labourer who has &s;aved a
little money by penury, immediately commences
farmer. He purcha&s;es his labouring cattle upon
credit, and depends on his little &s;tock for what
el&s;e he wants. What tickles him, is not inde|pendence
only, but to have the command of &s;er|vants
and hor&s;es. Many a poor man is involved
thus in difficulties, who lived more at ea&s;e while
he was a day-labourer. One unacquainted with
this &s;cene, would be amazed to hear, that in many
<PB N="283" REF="309">
places of Scotland, there are two, three, &s;ome|times
four, tenants about a &s;ingle plough, in a
poor farm that perhaps does not pay L. 5 yearly.
Were it not the ambition of being tenants, better
it would be for them to labour at 8 d. per day.
By this ambitious propen&s;ity in my countrymen,
much le&s;s is made by farming, than the tenant is
intitled to from the nature of his profe&s;&s;ion. It
is believed, that tho&s;e who are confined to one
plough, do not at a medium clear more than
L. 20 yearly; which exceeds not the wages of an
ordinary mechanic, and is not far above what a
day-labourer earns. The landlord indeed profits
by this propen&s;ity; becau&s;e the le&s;s that is drawn
of the product by the tenant, the more is left to
the landlord: but the profit is only temporary;
for the landlord &s;uffers in the main, by being ob|liged
to lower his rent for the encouragement of
more vigorous tenants.</P>
<P>However this be, the rent of &s;mall farms de|termines
the rent of every farm; for a landlord,
who draws of rent L. 80 from two &s;mall tenants,
will not ea&s;ily be per&s;uaded to &s;et both farms to
one tenant for L. 75. But it falls out luckily
here, that there is encouragement to great te|nants,
without encroaching on the landlord's in|tere&s;t.
A lea&s;e of &s;ix &s;mall farms will intitle him
to the &s;hare of each of the former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, which
is $word$ 120, without lowering the landlord's rent
one farthing.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="310">
I need &s;carce mention, that the expence of &s;eed
is a burden upon the annual product; as al&s;o the
expence of &s;hearing, thre&s;hing, &amp;c. as far as
the&s;e articles are performed by &s;trangers hired for
that purpo&s;e. And to &s;ave a vague account, a
lump &s;um ought to be &s;tated for the&s;e particulars.</P>
<P>It falls in here to be con&s;idered, whether the
nature of the &s;oil, good or bad, makes any dif|ference
upon the tenant's &s;hare of the product.
One thing is evident, that if he be not enabled to
live by his farm, he mu&s;t take him&s;elf to &s;ome
other occupation; and to live with any degree of
comfort, le&s;s he cannot have than L. 20 yearly,
however mean the &s;oil may be. On the other
hand, he is intitled to no benefit from the fertility
of the &s;oil; becau&s;e it adds neither to the expence
of culture nor of living. Fertility is a quality of
land; and a &s;ubject belongs to the proprietor with
all its qualities. As fertility depends not on the
tenant's &s;kill nor indu&s;try, he is intitled to no be|nefit
from it.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on, any &s;aving in the expence
of culture ought to benefit the landlord only; as
where, by the con&s;truction of a plough, two
draught-hor&s;es are &s;ufficient in&s;tead of three or
four: or where oxen are u&s;ed in&s;tead of hor&s;es:
the gain of the tenant is not le&s;&s;ened by &s;uch &s;a|vings.</P>
<P>On the other hand, where a tenant, by &s;upe|rior
&s;kill or extreme diligence, rai&s;es on an acre a
<PB N="285" REF="311">
bu&s;hel more than u&s;ual, the profit ought to be
his own: it is owing to him&s;elf, not to the ferti|lity
of the &s;oil.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Suppo&s;e a lime-quarry, or a bed of
&s;hell-marl, to be di&s;covered within a farm, or near
it, it ought to be con&s;idered as an article for the
landlord, in giving a new lea&s;e. The profit ought
to be his, &s;tating only an allowance to the tenant
for the expence he lays out upon the manure. It
is in effect adding to the fertility of the &s;oil;
which, for the rea&s;on above given, ought to be|nefit
the landlord only.</P>
<P>Let us illu&s;trate the&s;e general views, by &s;tating
an account of particulars. Take a farm of &s;ixty
acres; which being partly in pa&s;ture, may be ma|naged
by a &s;ingle plough with four hor&s;es. I be|gin
with computing the rent of &s;uch a farm, where
the product in corn and gra&s;s is at a medium e|qual
to the value of five bolls per acre, or 50 s.
amounting upon the whole farm to L. 150. Add
the profit of ten winterers fed with &s;traw, which
may be &s;tated at L. 5. The whole &s;um drawn
out of the land is L. 155; from which is to be
deducted the tenant's &s;hare, and every other ar|ticle
of expence: the balance is the landlord's
rent. Let us enter into the &s;everal articles of de|duction.</P>

<P>Here an unexpected di&s;covery is made of very
great importance in farming; which is, that a
farm yielding no more but an average of 3 1/2 bolls
per acre, had better be wholly &s;et for pa&s;ture.
For &s;uppo&s;ing it in that &s;hape to yield no more
but 5 s. per acre, which is L. 15 for the whole,
the clear profit is greater than when the farm is
in corn; and the landlord draws more rent: he
draws the whole L. 15, as land &s;et in pa&s;ture is
not burdened with any expence. This di&s;covery
may be of u&s;e to many a poor tenant, who labours
<PB N="288" REF="314">
and toils at the plough from year to year, to his
own lo&s;s. If his farm produce not more than 3 1/2
bolls per acre, better abandon the plough, turn
his farm into pa&s;ture, and &s;it idle.</P>
<P>But if a tenant can reduce his labouring cattle
to two hor&s;es or two oxen, the &s;aving will be &s;o
con&s;iderable as to make it his own intere&s;t as well
as that of the landlord to continue his corn|crops.
The &s;aving amounts to L. 16, 16 s. year|ly,
not to mention the driver; which throws the
balance again&s;t pa&s;ture no le&s;s than L. 12, 18 s.
&s;uppo&s;ing the farm in pa&s;ture to yield but 5 s. per
acre. This &s;aving benefits the tenant during his
lea&s;e, and benefits the landlord in giving a new
lea&s;e. But &s;uppo&s;ing the product to be but 3
bolls per acre, the balance turns clearly for pa|&s;ture,
after every &s;aving that can be made when
&s;uch a farm is in corn.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, however fertile the &s;oil may
be, the man who takes in lea&s;e a made farm, can|not
expect more but to live comfortably. If his
heart be &s;et on wealth, it is not to be found but
in land recently broken up from the &s;tate of na|ture,
where there is &s;cope for great and la&s;ting
improvements.</P>
<P>This &s;peculation ought to be a ruling motive

In our corn-counties, it is not difficult, nor

<P>Upon a review, the only doubtful article is the

cattle, is not &s;ufficient; for if the chance go a|gain&s;t
the poor tenant, he is undone. Something
for in&s;urance he ought to have; more or le&s;s is
arbitrary. But &s;uppo&s;ing it to be 3 <HI>per cent.</HI> or

<HEAD TYPE="sub">THEORY OF AGRICULTURE.</HEAD>
<P>THE operations of men can be ea&s;ily tra|ced:
they are confined to the &s;urface of
bodies. The operations of nature, go|ing
far out of &s;ight, reach even elementary par|ticles.
In explaining therefore natural effects, we
ought to re&s;t &s;atisfied with the immediate cau&s;es,
leaving the more remote to &s;uperior beings. In
order to unfold the theory of agriculture, the na|ture
of plants ought to be &s;tudied, their nouri&s;h|ment,
their propagation: we ought to be ac|quainted
with all the different &s;oils, and in what
manner they are affected by weather and climate.
And yet, after all our re&s;earches, how imperfect
remains our knowledge of the&s;e particulars! For|tunately,
agriculture depends not much on the|ory.
If it did, baneful it would be to the hu|man
race: &s;kilful practitioners would be rare;
and agriculture, upon which we depend for food,
would, by frequent di&s;appointments, be pro&s;e|cuted
with little ardour. Notwith&s;tanding there|fore
that the theory of agriculture is &s;till in its in|fant
&s;tate, the practice has made con&s;iderable ad|vances,
<PB N="291" REF="317">
e&s;pecially in Britain; and there are rules
founded on experience, that &s;eldom mi&s;lead when
applied by a &s;agacious farmer. In theory, the
deepe&s;t penetration pre&s;erves not writers from
wide differences. In practice, the ignorant only
differ: &s;agacious farmers generally agree; giving
allowance only for varieties in &s;oil and climate.</P>
<P>But admitting experience to be our only &s;ure
guide, theory however ought not to be rejected,
even by a practical farmer. Man is made for
knowledge; and he has a natural curio&s;ity to
learn the rea&s;on of every thing. Why not in|dulge
an appetite, that will amu&s;e, and may bring
forth in&s;truction? In dipping into theory, a com|plete
&s;y&s;tem is far from my thoughts, and far a|bove
my reach. I venture only to &s;elect a few
particulars, that have an immediate influence on
practice. The&s;e will be under&s;tood by every
gentleman who joins reading to experience; and
in doubtful ca&s;es may help to direct his opera|tions.
I give warning before hand, that I pre|tend
to no demon&s;tration. However po&s;itively I
may happen to expre&s;s my&s;elf in the glow of com|po&s;ition,
my be&s;t arguments are but conjectural.
Tho&s;e that are here di&s;played appear to me highly
probable; and if they appear &s;o to the reader, I
can have no farther wi&s;h.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>TO be an expert farmer, it is not nece&s;&s;ary that
a gentleman be a profound chymi&s;t. There
are however certain chymical principles relative to
agriculture, that no farmer of education ought to
be ignorant of. Such as appear the mo&s;t nece&s;|&s;ary
&s;hall be here &s;tated, beginning with elective
attraction and repul&s;ion, which make a capital ar|ticle
in the &s;cience of agriculture as well as of
chymi&s;try.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>1. ELECTIVE ATTRACTION AND REPULSION.</HEAD>
<P>BY an inherent quality in matter, every particle
of it is endued with a tendency to unite with e|very
other particle; and this tendency is termed
<HI>gravity.</HI> Be&s;ide gravity, common to all matter,
there is in &s;ome bodies a peculiar tendency to u|nite
together; acids and alkalis for example, air
and water, clay and water. The particular bo|dies
thus di&s;po&s;ed to unite, may be termed <HI>cor|re&s;ponding
bodies;</HI> and as &s;uch di&s;po&s;ition or
<PB N="293" REF="319">
tendency has a re&s;emblance to choice in voluntary
agents, it is termed <HI>elective attraction.</HI></P>
<P>The power of gravity extends as far as matter
exi&s;ts. Elective attraction, on the contrary, is
confined within a very narrow &s;pace: it operates
not but between bodies in contact, or approaching
nearly to it.</P>
<P>Even in the large&s;t bodies, &s;uch as the &s;un and
planets, every particle of matter operates by its
power of gravity. But elective attraction has no
&s;en&s;ible effect between large bodies, no particle
operating but tho&s;e in contact, or near it. It has
no &s;en&s;ible effect therefore but between bodies
that mix together. The attraction of gravity be|tween
two bodies is in the direct proportion to
the quantity of their matter: elective attraction is
in the inver&s;e proportion; which in plain lan|guage
is &s;aying, that the le&s;s bodies are, the great|er
is their elective attraction. Between large bo|dies
accordingly, elective attraction in oppo&s;ition
to gravity is as nothing: between very &s;mall bo|dies
in contact, or near it, it is far &s;uperior to
gravity.</P>
<P>The power of gravity in each particle of matter
corre&s;ponds to the quantity of matter in the uni|ver&s;e:
double that quantity, and you double the
power of gravity in every particle: annihilate the
half, and the power of gravity is reduced to the
half. Elective attraction, on the contrary, is in|variable.
It can hold but a certain quantity of
<PB N="294" REF="320">
corre&s;ponding matter: bring more within its
&s;phere of attraction, it has no effect. Thus, wa|ter
will hold &s;alt till it be &s;aturated; or, in other
words, till every particle of the water be in con|tact
with a particle of &s;alt. Add more &s;alt: it is
not attracted, but falls to the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el.
The &s;ame is ob&s;ervable in clay &s;aturated with wa|ter:
what water is added falls to the bottom.</P>
<P>Elective attraction between &s;ome corre&s;ponding
bodies, is more vigorous than between others.
Acids and alkalis attract each other violently, and
mix intimately. Such is the ca&s;e al&s;o of &s;alt and
water: &s;alt is &s;o thoroughly di&s;&s;olved in water as
to vani&s;h out of &s;ight, leaving the water tran&s;|parent
as before<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">We have Sir I&s;aac Newton's authority, that the o|pacity of a body is owing to the reflection or refraction of the rays of light at its &s;urface; and that the particles of a body mu&s;t be of a certain &s;ize to reflect or refract the rays of light. A body compo&s;ed of &s;maller particles, is tran&s;parent. Water, compo&s;ed of very &s;mall particles, is tran&s;parent: throw &s;alt into it, it maintains its tran&s;parency, having the power to di&s;&s;olve &s;alt into very &s;mall parts; and the &s;ame happens with re&s;pect to any other &s;ub&s;tance that is di&s;&s;olvable by water into very &s;mall parts.</NOTE>. There is an elective attrac|tion
between air and water: neither of them in
its natural &s;tate is ever found pure without the
other; and yet their mixture &s;eldom di&s;turbs their
tran&s;parency. In the in&s;tances above given, e|lective
<PB N="295" REF="321">
attraction prevails over gravity, which has
not power to &s;eparate the heavier body from the
lighter. Water and clay attract each other, but
with le&s;s vigour: powdered clay is &s;u&s;pended in
water; but the elective attraction is not &s;o &s;trong
as to di&s;&s;olve the clay: it continues vi&s;ible in the
mixture, and makes the water turbid. Their
mutual attraction yields by degrees to the repeat|ed
impul&s;es of gravity: the clay &s;ub&s;ides, leaving
the water tran&s;parent as originally. But each par|ticle
of clay draws along with it the particles of
water with which it is in contact. And accor|dingly
when the water is poured off, the clay re|mains
moi&s;t and &s;oft.</P>
<P>Both air and clay attract water; and when
they act in oppo&s;ition, it is of importance to know
which of them prevails. Where clay is &s;o wet as
that many particles of the water are not reached
by the attraction of the clay, &s;uch loo&s;e particles
are attracted by the air without oppo&s;ition. Even
particles of water, barely within the &s;phere of at|traction
of the clay, are drawn up by the &s;uperior
attraction of dry air. But the air mu&s;t be both
hot and dry, to carry off water that is in actual
contact with the clay. This I conjecture never
happens in pure clay, unle&s;s the heat be inten&s;e.</P>
<P>All &s;orts of earth do not attract water equally:
the attraction of clay is the &s;tronge&s;t, of &s;and the
weake&s;t. Between the&s;e extremes, &s;oils vary in
every degree with re&s;pect to their power of at|tracting
<PB N="296" REF="322">
and holding water. Even clays differ.
Some clays attract water vigorou&s;ly, others le&s;s.
This is manife&s;ted from the time that is taken in
drying; as the clay that attracts the mo&s;t vigo|rou&s;ly
will be the late&s;t of parting with its water.
I witne&s;&s;ed an experiment of different clays put
in &s;hallow ve&s;&s;els, and &s;oaked with water. They
differed in the times of drying at lea&s;t a fortnight.
I take it for granted, that the clay which retains
its water the longe&s;t, will turn the harde&s;t after it
is dry; for both effects depend on the force of
the elective attraction.</P>
<P>It is laid down above, that elective attraction is
the greate&s;t between the &s;malle&s;t bodies. Hence
an important le&s;&s;on in agriculture, which may be
ju&s;tly e&s;teemed the corner-&s;tone of the fabric, that
the more pulverized clay is, the more water it
will hold. A lump of dry clay immer&s;ed in wa|ter,
carries none away but what is attracted by
the &s;urface-particles. Pulverize this lump, and
give free admi&s;&s;ion to the water; let it be divided
into a million of parts or into ten million: each
particle however minute will hold a certain pro|portion
of water; and this proce&s;s may be car|ried
on as far as clay and water can be divided by
the hand of man<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mr Evelyn dug a deep hole in the ground, reduced the earth to powder, and put it back into the hole&punc; After a time, the powdered earth was found moi&s;t to the bottom, the ground round it remaining hard and dry.</NOTE>. Now as earth &s;erves only to
<PB N="297" REF="323">
retain moi&s;ture, and to furni&s;h it gradually to its
plants, the chief object of hu&s;bandry is, by plough|ing
and harrowing to pulverize clay, and every
other &s;oil that requires it. Clay, it is true, is di|vi&s;ible
into &s;o many parts as readily to unite with
water into a very hard ma&s;s; witne&s;s car&s;e-clay,
of which afterward. But there is no danger of
&s;uch exce&s;s in common clay, which is compo&s;ed
of particles more gro&s;s than tho&s;e of car&s;e-clay.
In common clay, there is no other limit to bene|ficial
pulveration, but the expence of the work.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o ob&s;ervable an elective attraction
between earth and air. Much air is found in
earth, becau&s;e gravity concurs with the elective
attraction to bring down air. But very little earth
is found in air; becau&s;e in that ca&s;e gravity coun|teracts
the elective attraction.</P>
<P>A plant attracts air and water, and is attracted
by them. The latter attraction is without effect,
becau&s;e plants are fixed to a place. The former
is clearly di&s;played by Dr Hales in his &s;tatical e&s;|&s;ays,
containing the be&s;t conducted experiments
that are known, next to tho&s;e of Sir I&s;aac Newton
upon light and colours. There is not the &s;lighte&s;t
evidence, that plants attract any dry matter, how|ever
pulverized. Set the mo&s;t healthy vegetable
in dried earth, or in du&s;t gathered from the high|way:
it dies, and the earth remains as weighty
as before. It is clear then, that a plant can re|ceive
no nouri&s;hment but what is conveyed to it
<PB N="298" REF="324">
by air or water; and con&s;equently that nothing
can &s;erve as its nouri&s;hment but what is &s;oluble in
the&s;e elements. Clay is not &s;oluble even in wa|ter:
it is ea&s;ily &s;eparated from water by the force
of gravity; and its particles are probably too
gro&s;s to ente$ with water into the mouths of a
plant.</P>
<P>Black bodies attract and ab&s;orb rays of the &s;un.
A black wall facing the &s;un, is hotter even to the
touch than a wall of any other colour; and hence
the practice of blacking fruit-walls. Soil made
black by high culture, attracts and ab&s;orbs rays
of the &s;un in plenty; and turns remarkably hotter
than &s;oil of any other colour.</P>
<P>That there is a mutual attraction between par|ticles
of water, appears from the globules it
forms it&s;elf into in falling; from the globules
it forms it&s;elf into when dropt gently upon a
dry board; and from its ri&s;ing above the lips
when gently poured into a gla&s;s. But I am un|certain
whether there be any elective attraction
between particles of clay: put dry powdered clay
into a ve&s;&s;el, and pre&s;s it together at plea&s;ure; it
comes out with little or no cohe&s;ion. Water is
the cement that hardens particles of clay into a &s;o|lid
lump. Where the water &s;uperabounds &s;o as
that part of it only can be in contact with the
clay, the remainder continues fluid, and the mix|ture
i$ a &s;oft ma&s;$. But where by evaporation no
more is left but what is in contact with the clay,
<PB N="299" REF="325">
evaporation is at an end, becau&s;e water is attract|ed
more &s;trongly by clay, than by air in its or|dinary
&s;tate; and the ma&s;s hardens by degrees.
A green turf from a moi&s;t &s;oil, falls to pieces in
handling. Let it lie a few days to dry, it becomes
tough and firm. The like happens in a mixture
of quick lime, &s;and, and water. The water con|tinues
for a time fluid; and the ma&s;s is &s;oft and
ductile. Upon evaporation of the &s;uperfluous
moi&s;ture, the elective attraction operates; and
the ma&s;s turns hard like a &s;tone. A mixture of
clay and &s;and moi&s;tened with water, continues
long &s;oft; but in time turns exceedingly hard:
the pier of Eyemouth in Berwick&s;hire is built of
a plumcake &s;tone, compo&s;ed of pebbles, clay,
and &s;and, cemented with water; yet no &s;tone is
harder, nor le&s;s affected with the &s;ea-air. Plai&s;ter
of Paris is compo&s;ed of gyp&s;um and water; which
are mixed together to a certain con&s;i&s;tence; and
the ma&s;s, &s;till fluid, is poured into a mould: in
a few minutes it acquires a &s;tony hardne&s;s. A
compo&s;ition of that kind is u&s;ed for bridges in the
i&s;land Minorca: no &s;ooner is one &s;tone of the arch
joined to another, than it bears a man to add a
third. The cement here operates almo&s;t in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly:
water operates flower in hardening
clay; and &s;till &s;lower in hardening a mixture of
lime and &s;and.</P>
<P>The&s;e differences depend probably on the more
<PB N="300" REF="326">
or le&s;s vigour of the elective attraction. As the
&s;uperfluous moi&s;ture evaporates, the corre&s;pond|ing
bodies approach nearer and nearer to each o|ther,
and at la&s;t unite in one ma&s;s. This opera|tion
is &s;low in proportion to the vigour of the e|lective
attraction; and the &s;lower the operation
is, the ma&s;s becomes the harder. Some &s;orts of
clay attract water more vigorou&s;ly than others;
and when the &s;uperfluous moi&s;ture is exhaled,
which is done very &s;lowly, the ma&s;s turns hard in
proportion. Car&s;e-clay affords a good in&s;tance.
It is compo&s;ed of the fine&s;t parts of natural clay,
wa&s;hed off by running water: it is depo&s;ited in
flat ground where the water &s;tagnates; and is ac|cumulated
by degrees till the ground ri&s;e above
the &s;tream. Car&s;e-lands are generally near the
&s;ea, and the reflux of the tide contributes to the
effect. By the minutene&s;s of its parts, car&s;e-clay
mixes &s;o intimately with water as to give the e|lective
attraction its utmo&s;t efficacy. Thus car&s;e-clay,
which is extremely wet in winter, becomes
&s;o hard in a droughty &s;pring as to yield but a very
&s;canty crop, unle&s;s the &s;ummer be moi&s;t. In a
dry &s;ummer, fi&s;&s;ures are every where &s;een in it,
&s;ome of them &s;o wide as to admit a man's hand.
Common clay, compo&s;ed of gro&s;&s;er parts, never
hardens &s;o much. Hence it is, that of all crops
beans thrive the be&s;t in car&s;e-clay: the tap root
pu&s;hes vigorou&s;ly into the hard &s;oil; and finds
<PB N="301" REF="327">
more water locked up there than in common
clay<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The clay in the Car&s;e of Gowry, of Falkirk, and of Stirling, is much of the &s;ame nature. When dry, it is white, le&s;s weighty than common clay, pure without &s;and, and divides into very minute parts. The la&s;t-mentioned quality, which gives elective attraction its greate&s;t efficacy, makes it cake at the &s;urface when &s;tir|red before winter. It makes it al&s;o in drought unite in|to very hard clods, harder than tho&s;e of common clay, compo&s;ed of gro&s;&s;er parts. As all clays hold water in proportion to the minutene&s;s of their parts, fro&s;t acts more vigorou&s;ly upon car&s;e-clay than upon the ordinary &s;ort; becau&s;e fro&s;t acts upon bodies in proportion to the quantity of water in them.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This tendency to hardne&s;s in clay-&s;oil, is a great
ob&s;truction to fertility; and to counteract that
bad quality, I know no means more effectual than
frequent ploughing and harrowing. In that view
partly, the harrows above de&s;cribed were invent|ed:
they divide the &s;oil into minute parts: every
part holds a particle of water ready for the nou|ri&s;hment
of plants; and the &s;oil at the &s;ame time
is kept open, inviting the roots to extend them|&s;elves
in all directions.</P>
<P>The time that water takes to harden clay, will
explain &s;everal articles. I mention fir&s;t an article
of importance, which is the different effects of
ploughing clay wet or dry. The running a
plough through clay &s;oaked in water, produces
no change. Upon evaporation of the loo&s;er parts
<PB N="302" REF="328">
of the water, the vacuities left render the &s;oft
ma&s;s compre&s;&s;ible. To compre&s;s it in that &s;tate
would have the effect to keep in the remainder of
the loo&s;e water from evaporating, at the &s;ame
time give the elective attraction its &s;tronge&s;t effect,
and accelerate the hardening contrary to the very
intention of ploughing. Let not the plough be
applied till the air has performed its part by draw|ing
off every particle of water that is not in con|tact
with the clay. Nick that minute for apply|ing
the plough: the clay &s;till &s;oft is ea&s;ily divided:
a new &s;urface is laid open to the air: evapora|tion
is renewed; and by every ploughing and har|rowing
the &s;oil turns drier, and at the &s;ame time
is pre&s;erved free and open.</P>
<P>The next article I &s;hall mention, is the making
brick. Where air and water are brought into
contact by elective attraction, the proce&s;s is com|pleted:
for they never harden into a &s;olid body.
But after clay and water are brought into con|tact,
the proce&s;s goes on till they be firmly united.
In the commencement of that proce&s;s, the air
may be rendered &s;o hot and dry, as to overcome
the elective attraction, and &s;uck up the whole
moi&s;ture, leaving the clay dry with little or no
cohe&s;ion. Wet clay put into a hot fire, does not
harden, but falls into a burnt powder. The &s;u|perfluous
moi&s;ture mu&s;t be evaporated, and the
cohe&s;ion be con&s;iderably advanced, before it can
be hardened into a brick by fire. In that condi|tion,
<PB N="303" REF="329">
the elective attraction prevails over the hot|te&s;t
air. Form dough into a thin cake, and lay
it upon a plate of iron over a fire: the moi&s;ture
&s;uddenly evaporates; and no more is left but
what is barely &s;ufficient to keep the parts &s;lightly
together. Give the elective attraction time to o|perate:
the cake turns hard like a brick.</P>
<P>Nature operates by elective repul&s;ion as well as
by elective attraction; but as agriculture &s;eems
to depend little upon the former, I &s;hall &s;ay but a
word upon it. There is an elective repul&s;ion in
the particles of air, which gives them a tendency
to recede from each other; and this operation is
greatly invigorated by heat. Heat therefore pul|verizes
the &s;oil by rarifying the air contained in it,
which moves the particles of earth out of their
place. Fro&s;t has a &s;imilar effect, by rarifying the
water contained in a &s;oil. Black, as ob&s;erved a|bove,
attracts and ab&s;orbs rays of the &s;un; and
therefore black is the be&s;t colour of &s;oil. The
more parts clay or loam is divided into, the black|er
it is. Whatever be the colour of the &s;oil where
potatoes are &s;$t, it is rendered black by that crop.
A potato-crop is a powerful pulverizer: the bul|bous
roots &s;welling without intermi&s;&s;ion, keep the
&s;urrounding earth in con&s;tant motion, and divide
more effectually than a plough or a harrow. White
repels the rays of the &s;un; and upon that account
is a bad colour for &s;oil. Pulverizing by dunging,
ploughing, and harrowing, is a &s;ure means to
<PB N="304" REF="330">
convert white &s;oil into black; which is an addi|tional
motive for being diligent in the&s;e opera|tions.</P>

<HEAD>2. PLANTS HAVE A FACULTY TO ACCOMMO|DATE
THEMSELVES TO THEIR SITUA|TION.</HEAD>
<P>ALL trees are provided by nature with a tap|root,
fit for piercing the harde&s;t &s;oil; and a tree
growing in clay exerts great energy on that root.
It le&s;&s;ens in vigour and &s;ize where a tree grows in
loam; and lateral roots prevail more, which are
&s;pread all around for procuring food. In very
light &s;oil, the tap-root is very &s;mall; and a tree
growing in water has many roots, but not the
lea&s;t appearance of a tap-root. Nature is won|derful
in all her works. A plant here acts as if
endued with the &s;agacity of a thinking being: in
this in&s;tance, and in many that will be unfolded
afterward, vegetable life &s;eems to be not far re|mote
from animal life.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of a plant depends greatly on
the &s;oil it is bred in. Cu&s;tom becomes a &s;econd
nature; and it appears no le&s;s difficult, to tran&s;|plant
a tree from the &s;oil where it was reared to
an oppo&s;ite &s;oil, than to tran&s;plant a tree from a
hot to a cold climate. However fitted by nature a
tree may be for growing in a loo&s;e &s;oil; yet if
planted young in a &s;tiff &s;oil, it acquires a con&s;ti|tution
<PB N="305" REF="331">
accommodated to that &s;oil; and its nature
is &s;o far altered, as in a mea&s;ure to di&s;qualify it
for being tran&s;planted into a loo&s;e &s;oil. Take a
vegetable that has been reared in water, and plant
it in a &s;oil even the mo&s;t proper for it by nature:
it will infallibly die. In general, plants reared in
water will not grow in earth; and plants reared
in earth will not grow in water. Hence it is,
that where water &s;tagnates ten or twelve inches
under the &s;urface, the plants reared in that
ground turn &s;ickly when their roots reach the
water. Yet the&s;e plants would have flouri&s;hed in
pure water, had they been accu&s;tomed to it
early.</P>
<P>But may not a plant acquire a con&s;titution, fit|ting
it for growing partly in earth partly in wa|ter?
Trees grow vigorou&s;ly on the brink of a ri|ver,
where &s;ome of the roots mu&s;t be in water.
At the &s;eat of Mr Burnet of Kemnay, ten miles
from Aberdeen, a kitchen-garden, a flower-gar|den,
a wilderne&s;s of trees indigenous and exotic,
are all in a peat-mo&s;s, where water &s;tagnates from
one foot to two under the &s;urface.</P>
<P>The &s;ame faculty is exerted to remedy an incon|venient
&s;ituation. A tree that grows without
&s;helter, re&s;i&s;ts wind by the length of its roots:
the roots of the &s;ame tree, are commonly much
&s;horter in a &s;heltered place. In the Leeward
i&s;lands, the ea&s;t wind is almo&s;t con&s;tant; and the
trees there, extend their roots much farther to
<PB N="306" REF="332">
that quarter, than to any other. A tree overtop|ed
by neighbouring trees, directs its cour&s;e to a
a &s;pace that is free; and then mounts up perpen|dicularly
according to its nature. Set a plant in
a room that has no light but from a &s;ingle hole in
the wall: in&s;tead of ri&s;ing perpendicularly, it di|rects
its cour&s;e toward the light, pa&s;&s;es through
the hole into open air, and then mounts upward.
The power of remedying a bad &s;ituation, is re|remarkable
in &s;eed of every kind. A &s;eed con|tains
the plant in miniature, with a <HI>plumula</HI> that
tends upward, and a <HI>radicle</HI> that tends down|ward.
Put a &s;eed into the ground with its plu|mula
above and its radicle below as the piant
grows, the former a&s;cends and the latter de&s;cends,
both perpendicularly. Invert the po&s;ition of the
&s;eed, the plumula &s;hoots not downward, nor the
radicle upward: they twi&s;t round the &s;eed, till the
former gain the open air, and the latter pierce
into the ground. Providence is wonderful in e|very
operation: were not provi&s;ion made for the
&s;pringing of &s;eed in every po&s;ition, agriculture ne|ver
could have made any progre&s;s<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See more about the powers and faculties of plants, Appendix, N$ 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A change of con&s;titution in plants, occa&s;ioned
by their &s;ituation, is commonly tran&s;mitted to
their offspring. Plants propagated from &s;eed pro|duced
in a warm &s;andy &s;oil, grow fa&s;t in whatever
<PB N="307" REF="333">
&s;oil the &s;eed is &s;own, and have early flowers.
Plants from &s;eed produced in a cold &s;tiff &s;oil, are
late of growing, even in a warm &s;oil. Plants from
&s;eed produced in a very rich &s;oil, grow vigorou&s;ly
in a poor &s;oil. Plants from &s;eed of a poor &s;oil,
grow weakly even in the riche&s;t &s;oil, and produce
&s;mall &s;eed. In the rainy harve&s;t 1744, oats that
grew in a warm light &s;oil, &s;prouted in the &s;hock
ten days more early than oats that grew in a
cold &s;oil; though both were produced from the
&s;ame &s;eed, and both were cut down the &s;ame day.
Hence the advantage of changing &s;eed from a
warm to a cold &s;oil. It may be true, that &s;eed
from a warm &s;oil will not grow &s;o quickly in a
cold &s;oil as in a warm &s;oil; but it will always grow
more quickly than &s;eed from a cold &s;oil. To rear
trees in a middling &s;oil, it is certainly right to
take the young plants from a richer &s;oil. But is
it right to tran&s;plant them from a rich &s;oil to one
that is poor? They have, it is true, a tendency
to grow vigorou&s;ly. But will they not be dwarf|i&s;h
in the poor &s;oil, which cannot afford them &s;uf|ficiency
of nouri&s;hment to &s;upport their vigour?</P>
<P>That a plant may change its con&s;titution by
being tran&s;planted into a climate a little warmer
or colder, is certain; and the change of con&s;titu|tion
is &s;till more ea&s;y when the plant is rai&s;ed from
&s;eed. Thus plants of one climate may, by gra|dual
change of place in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations,
pro&s;per in a very different climate. When Galen
<PB N="308" REF="334">
the phy&s;ician lived, the peach was too delicate for
the air of Italy. It has been creeping northward
&s;lowly; and, even in Britain at pre&s;ent, it is of a
good flavour, if artfully cultivated. The cherry
tree was brought by Lucullus from the Le&s;&s;er
A&s;ia to Rome, as a great rarity; and now it bears
good fruit even in Scotland. The ble&s;&s;ings of
Providence are di&s;tributed with an equal hand.
We are enabled to remedy by indu&s;try the natu|ral
defects of our &s;oil and &s;ituation: are we le&s;s
happy than tho&s;e who owe all to &s;oil and &s;itua|tion?
If wheat, if fruits, if cabbage, if colly|flower,
were confined to their native climates,
what would Britain be? Iceland would be not
much inferior.</P>
<P>But though a change of con&s;titution is produ|ced
as far as nece&s;&s;ary for accommodating a plant
to a different climate, yet it is ob&s;ervable, that
in other re&s;pects the original con&s;titution remains
entire. I give for one in&s;tance the flowering of
plants. A plant tran&s;lated into a different cli|mate,
pre&s;erves its original &s;ea&s;on of flowering,
unle&s;s prevented by &s;ome powerful cau&s;e. The
climate of the &s;hores of Spain and Portugal,
&s;uits the flowering of the <HI>lauru&s;tinus</HI> in De|cember
and January; nor is the cold of Scot|land
in the&s;e months &s;ufficient to deter him from
his &s;ea&s;on. I mean the milder parts; for in the
higher and more rigerous parts, the cold puts
him pa&s;t his &s;ea&s;on, and prevents his &s;preading
<PB N="309" REF="335">
any flower till April. Dr Walker &s;ays, that were
he to &s;ee a <HI>lauru&s;tinus</HI> flowering with us in win|ter,
and had never heard of the &s;hrub, he would
without &s;cruple pronounce it no native of this
country; and that for the &s;ame rea&s;on he would
deny the <HI>arbutus</HI> to be a native of Ireland, or
the whin, of Scotland. He adds plea&s;antly, that
the flowering of the&s;e &s;hrubs with us, is an out|landi&s;h
fa&s;hion; and that no &s;en&s;ible Scotch plant
will ever think of &s;uch a thing.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>3. CHANGE OF SEED, AND OF SPECIES.</HEAD>
<P>THE rea&s;on for changing &s;eed from a warm to
a cold &s;oil, is explained in the foregoing &s;ection.
But &s;kilful farmers are not &s;atisfied with that
&s;ingle change: they frequently change &s;eed from
a cold to a warm &s;oil; and they &s;eldom venture
to &s;ow twice &s;ucce&s;&s;ively the &s;ame grain in the
&s;ame field. Such changes of &s;eed, as well as of
&s;pecies, are general; yet I know not that the
rea&s;on has been fairly explained by any writer. I
wi&s;h that what follows may give &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Every &s;pecies of animals has a climate adapted
to it, where it flouri&s;hes, where it grows to per|fection,
and where it never degenerates. Propa|gation
will go on in a le&s;s proper climate; but
the &s;pecies degenerates, if not kept up by fre|quent
recruits from the original climate. In that
view, Arabian and Barbary hor&s;es are from time
<PB N="310" REF="336">
to time imported into England. Nor is this a|lone
&s;ufficient: animals procreated of the &s;ame
breed quickly degenerate; for which rea&s;on, great
attention is given to mix different breeds. In
the&s;e particulars, plants re&s;emble animals. Bri|tain
is not the native climate of melons: they de|generate
quickly, if &s;eed be not procured from
the native climate. Where wheat grows natu|rally,
&s;eed dropping from the mother plant ar|rives
at perfection, though neither &s;eed nor &s;oil
be changed. But as wheat is not a native of Bri|tain,
it has a tendency to degenerate here, e&s;pe|cially
in the northern parts; and it degenerates
rapidly, if the &s;eed be &s;own year after year where
it was produced. It is not &s;ufficient, that the
&s;eed be taken from a different field: it ought al|&s;o
to be taken from a different &s;oil. Nor is this
all: the greate&s;t care in changing &s;eed will not
prevent degeneracy, where the &s;ame &s;pecies is
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively propagated in the &s;ame field. It is
accordingly a rule univer&s;ally practi&s;ed in crop|ping
a field, that not only ought &s;eed to be
brought from a different &s;oil, but that the &s;pecies
al&s;o ought to be changed; or, in other words,
that there ought to be a rotation of crops. This
rule holds in barley as well as in wheat; and &s;till
more in red clover, which degenerates quickly
when &s;own without intermi&s;&s;ion in the &s;ame field.
It is more common to &s;ow oats after oats; and if
that plant be a native of Britain, the practice may
<PB N="311" REF="337">
e&s;cape cen&s;ure, e&s;pecially if care be taken to
change the &s;eed. White clover is a native of Bri|tain,
and requires little precaution in cropping.
By Tull's mode of hu&s;bandry, tolerable crops of
wheat have been rai&s;ed in the &s;ame field, fifteen or
&s;ixteen years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; but toward the end, the
degeneracy became vi&s;ible. Artful culture will do
much; but it is not alone &s;ufficient to prevail over
the laws of nature. This is an objection to Tull's
hu&s;bandry which that ingenious author did not
fore&s;ee. His mode however ought not to be to|tally
rejected: to rai&s;e by artful culture, without
manure, ten or twelve crops of wheat &s;ucce&s;&s;ively
in the &s;ame field, is a capital improvement in
farms where manure is &s;carce.</P>
<P>The degeneracy of plants and animals in cli|mates
where they are not natives, depends on
cau&s;es beyond the reach of human inve&s;tigation.
But to a per&s;on who&s;e curio&s;ity is not boundle&s;s,
it may be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that if every &s;pe|cies
of animals and plants have a climate fitted for
them, there is no rea&s;on to expect perfection in
an improper climate.</P>
<P>If what is &s;aid hold true, an exten&s;ive rotation of
crops in the &s;ame field mu&s;t be good hu&s;bandry.
In a clay &s;oil, wheat after fallow without change
of &s;pecies, is not uncommon. I &s;hould imagine,
that in Scotland a crop of wheat every other year
in the &s;ame field, would be apt to degenerate.
There is an additional rea&s;on again&s;t that practice,
<PB N="312" REF="338">
that it requires a larger &s;tock of working cattle
than a more varied rotation. A &s;kilful farmer
cultivates his wheat-land in October, his beans in
January, his oats in March, his barley in April
or May, and his turnip in June or July, all with
the &s;ame cattle.</P>
<P>The particulars above &s;et forth, are what I
judge the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential in the theory of agricul|ture,
and what will be found nece&s;&s;ary for under|&s;tanding
the &s;ubjects handled in the following
chapters. Many other particulars, le&s;s exten&s;ive
though perhaps no le&s;s material, are introduced
where there is occa&s;ion for them. Upon the
whole, in order to ea&s;e the reader, I have avoid|ed
every article of theory that is not clo&s;ely con|nected
with practice, &s;uch as a gentleman may be
ignorant of, without &s;uffering the imputation of
being an un&s;kilful farmer.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">FOOD OF PLANTS, AND FERTILITY OF
SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>IN no branch of philo&s;ophy are imagination and
conjecture more freely indulged, than in what
concerns the food of plants. Every writer erects
a &s;y&s;tem: if he can give it a plau&s;ible appearance,
he inquires no farther. It never enters into his
<PB N="313" REF="339">
thoughts, that his &s;y&s;tem ought to be &s;ubjected to
the rigid touch&s;tone of facts and experiments: &s;o
grievous a torture he cannot &s;ubmit to. This re|flection
will be ju&s;tified by what follows. And to
pave the way, a general view of the nouri&s;hment
of plants &s;hall be premi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Juices imbibed through the roots and leaves of
a plant, are by an internal proce&s;s converted into
&s;ap, which, not improperly, may be called the
<HI>chyle</HI> of vegetables. Sap is in a continual o&s;cil|latory
motion, a&s;cending during the heat of day,
and de&s;cending during the cold of night.</P>
<P>The &s;ap of a plant is nearly the &s;ame, in what|ever
&s;oil the plant grows. Homberg filled a pot
with earth containing a portion of &s;altpetre: he
filled another pot with pure earth well wa&s;hed.
The cre&s;&s;es that grew in the&s;e pots were entirely
of the &s;ame nature, equally alkale&s;cent; what
grew in the fir&s;t pot as little acid as what grew in
the &s;econd. In other two pots, prepared in the
&s;ame manner, he planted fennel, an acid plant.
The difference of earth made no difference in the
two plants. I advance a &s;tep farther. If we can
judge of &s;ap from what of it per&s;pires from the
plant, it is nearly the &s;ame, even in different &s;pe|cies.
Dr Hales collected the liquor per&s;pired
from trees of different kinds. It was very clear:
its &s;pecific gravity was nearly the &s;ame with that
of common water; and no difference of ta&s;te
could be perceived in the different liquors. The&s;e
<PB N="314" REF="340">
facts are confirmed by many other experiments;
all of them evincing, that however different the
juices may be that are imbibed by a plant, yet
that the &s;ap into which the&s;e juices are converted
is the &s;ame, or nearly the &s;ame, even in plants of
different &s;pecies. If &s;o, every plant mu&s;t be en|dowed
with proper powers; fir&s;t, to imbibe
juices; next, to convert into &s;ap the juices imbi|bed;
and la&s;t, to convert that &s;ap into its own
&s;ub&s;tance. With re&s;pect to the two fir&s;t powers,
all plants appear to be &s;imilar. The difference of
&s;pecies is carried on by the la&s;t power only, that
of converting &s;ap into the &s;ub&s;tance of a plant.
Hence a peculiar texture, colour, &s;mell, ta&s;te, in
each &s;pecies. &startq;Thus,&endq; &s;ays Dr Hunter of York,
&startq;a ma&s;s of innocent earth can give life and vi|gour
to the bitter aloe and to the &s;weet cane,
to the cool hou&s;e-leek and to the fiery mu&s;tard,
to the nouri&s;hing wheat and to the deadly
night-&s;hade.&endq; In what manner or by what
means the changes mentioned are produced, will
for ever remain a &s;ecret: they depend on ener|gies
impenetrable by the eye, and beyond the
reach of experiment. Nor ought the farmer to
repine at the being denied the knowledge of &s;uch
matters. The province of agriculture is, to cul|tivate
&s;oils in &s;uch a manner as to furni&s;h juices
in plenty: the re&s;t mu&s;t be left to nature; and
may &s;afely be left, for &s;he never errs in her ope|rations.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="341">
Thus prepared, we proceed to examine the
mo&s;t noted opinions concerning the food of plants.
A number of writers hold, that oil and &s;alt are ca|pital
ingredients in vegetable food; and that the
riche&s;t &s;oils are what contain the greate&s;t quan|tity
of the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances. Oil and &s;alt are found
in vegetables. &startq;<HI>Ergo,</HI>&endq; &s;ay the&s;e writers, &startq;oil
and &s;alt in the &s;oil make the nouri&s;hment of
plants.&endq; It may as well be rea&s;oned, that as
all animals have blood, <HI>ergo,</HI> blood is the nou|ri&s;hment
of animals. The &s;ame doctrine applied
to manures, has led Dr Hunter, mentioned a|bove,
to propo&s;e a manure con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of
oil, termed by him the <HI>oil compo&s;t;</HI> upon which
he lays great weight. Every attempt to enlighten
is prai&s;e-worthy; but &s;uch attempts &s;eldom are
&s;ucce&s;sful, unle&s;s to mi&s;lead the credulous hu&s;|bandman.
From what is &s;aid above, it may be
pronounced with certainty, that the oil and &s;alt
which enter into the compo&s;ition of vegetables,
are not imbibed from the earth or air; but are
formed from more &s;imple materials, by the inter|nal
proce&s;s above mentioned. A number of plants
of different kinds, may find room for growing in
thirty or forty pounds of earth. Each of them
has an oil and a &s;alt peculiar to it&s;elf; though
there may not be in the earth the &s;malle&s;t particle
of either. Nay, by repeated experiments it has
been found, that plants rai&s;ed in water are com|po&s;ed
of the &s;ame parts with tho&s;e rai&s;ed in earth.
<PB N="316" REF="342">
Led by this erroneous opinion, &s;everal writers have
conjectured, that clay-marl, a potent manure,
mu&s;t contain a large proportion of &s;alt and oil.
But it being found on trial, that it contains nei|ther,
they were reduced to another conjecture,
that when mixed with the &s;oil, it attracts &s;alt and
oil from the air. And now from Dr Ain&s;lie's ac|curate
and elegant experiments<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Edinburgh Phy&s;ical E&s;&s;ays, vol. 3. article 1.</NOTE>, that &s;uppo&s;i|tion
appears to have as little foundation as the o|thers
mentioned.</P>
<P>Had due attention been given to the mouths of
roots, &s;o &s;mall as not to be di&s;cernible by the na|ked
eye, it mu&s;t have been obvious, that oil is a
&s;ub&s;tance too gro&s;s for entering the&s;e orifices.
Chymi&s;ts hold, that all oils are compo&s;ed of in|flamable
matter, mixed, by means of an acid,
with earthy and watery particles. Nay, it is held
in general, that every &s;ub&s;tance &s;u&s;ceptible of a
chymical operation, is a compound; and it is
natural to think &s;o, for elementary particles are
&s;u$ely too minute for our handling. Now, as
oil, far from being an element, is compo&s;ed of va|rious
parts, it is certainly too gro&s;s for the mouths
of plants. Its component parts may be &s;ufficient|ly
minute for admi&s;&s;ion: but then the&s;e parts are
not oil; though by an internal proce&s;s they may
be converted into oil, or converted into any other
&s;ub&s;tance. Salt indeed is &s;oluble in water, &s;o as
<PB N="317" REF="343">
to become invi&s;ible; and with water con&s;equent|ly
it may be imbibed by plants. But &s;alt is too
acrid to be a nouri&s;hment for plants; and if im|bibed
in any quantity, will be de&s;tructive.</P>
<P>I have given the &s;tricte&s;t attention to this doc|trine,
in order to put the &s;peculative farmer on
his guard. If he a&s;&s;ent to what is here delivered,
it may &s;ave him much time, that would be lo&s;t in
peru&s;ing certain hu&s;bandry-books, and much la|bour
in pro&s;ecuting idle experiments. And here
I mu&s;t &s;ay again, for it cannot be too often &s;aid,
that the province of agriculture is, to prepare the
foil &s;o as to furni&s;h plenty of juices, leaving the
re&s;t to nature.</P>
<P>Tull is one of the bolde&s;t theori&s;ts that have
come under my in&s;pection. He pronounces with|out
he&s;itation, that all plants live on the &s;ame
food or <HI>pabulum,</HI> which he &s;ays is pulverized
earth; and upon that foundation, he pretends to
rai&s;e perpetual crops of wheat in the &s;ame field,
by the plough alone, without manure. This in|deed
would re&s;tore the golden age of ea&s;e and in|dolence;
as there is no &s;oil &s;o barren, but what
may readily be pulverized. Tull was a man of
genius, but mi&s;erably defective in principles.
Plants imbibe water plentifully at the leaves, bark,
and roots; and with water they imbibe whatever
is di&s;&s;olved in it. But earth is not &s;oluble in wa|ter;
and accordingly, by an experiment of Van
Helmont it appears, that earth makes no part of
<PB N="318" REF="344">
the food of plants. He put into a ve&s;&s;el two hun|dred
pounds of dry earth; which he moi&s;tened
with rain-water, and planted in it a cutting of
willow, weighing five pounds. The mouth of
the ve&s;&s;el, to keep out du&s;t, was covered with a
tin-plate, having many &s;mall holes, through which
rain or di&s;tilled water was poured from time to
time, for keeping the earth moi&s;t. The willow
weighed at the end of five years a hundred and
&s;ixty-nine pounds and about three ounces; and
the weight would have been much greater, had
the leaves that fell the fir&s;t four years been com|puted.
At the end of the fifth year, the earth
was taken out of the ve&s;&s;el; and, when dried,
was found to have lo&s;t none of the original weight
excepting two ounces. Mr Boyle made a &s;imilar
experiment with gourds, the re&s;ult of which was
the &s;ame<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">From experiments made by Dr Woodward, he af|firms, that earth is imbibed with water in a con&s;iderable quantity (Tran&s;actions of the Royal Society, ann. 1699). In two gla&s;s phials full of water, he put an equal quan|tity of garden-mould. In one of them a plant of mint was &s;et, and the earth after a time was &s;en&s;ibly dimi|ni&s;hed; but not in the other where no plant was &s;et. The Doctor did not advert, that garden-mould, which perhaps for a century had been regularly dunged, mu&s;t be replete with animal and vegetable particles, that are &s;oluble in water, and with it are imbibed by plants. By the extraction of &s;uch particles, it is no wonder that the earth put into the phial was dimini&s;hed. But &s;uch par|ticles are not earth; and therefore the Doctor's expe|riments contradict not tho&s;e of Van Helmont and Mr Boyle.</NOTE>. Tull's &s;y&s;tem then is &s;ingularly un|lucky:
<PB N="319" REF="345">
of all &s;ub&s;tances, earth appears to be the
lea&s;t fitted for nouri&s;hing plants; and from Van
Helmont's experiment it is clear, that if at all it
enter the mouths of plants, the quantity is incon|&s;iderable:
of the great quantity of earth, two
ounces only were lo&s;t; and &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e two
ounces to have been di&s;&s;olved in the water and
&s;ucked in by the plant, it was next to nothing,
con&s;idering the weight of the whole plant, which
was a hundred and &s;ixty nine pounds.</P>
<P>Other writers, more cautious, avoid &s;pecifying
any particular &s;ub&s;tance as the food of plants:
but hold, that every &s;pecies of plants require a
peculiar nouri&s;hment; and that roots imbibe tho&s;e
juices only which are fitted for nouri&s;hing the
the plant. The refutation of this hypothe&s;is will
not require many words. It is &s;ufficient to ob|&s;erve,
that it is refuted by unconte&s;table experi|ments.
Plants take in with air and water what|ever
is di&s;&s;olved in them, without di&s;tingui&s;hing
the &s;alutary from the noxious: there is not the
lea&s;t appearance in any plant of a choice. Barley
has been poi&s;oned with brim&s;tone, and mint with
&s;alt water. Mr George Bell &s;tudent of phy&s;ic in
the college of Edinburgh, an ingenious young
<PB N="320" REF="346">
gentleman, made the following experiments, which
he obligingly imparted to me. A number of Je|ru&s;alem
artichokes were &s;et in pots filled with
pure &s;and. One plant was kept as a &s;tandard,
being nouri&s;hed with common water only. Other
plants of the &s;ame kind, were nouri&s;hed with wa|ter
in which &s;alt of tartar, a fixed alkali, was di&s;|&s;olved.
The&s;e grew more vigorou&s;ly than the
&s;tandard plant. But by reiterated waterings,
there came to be &s;uch an accumulation of the
fixed alkali among the &s;and, as to make the
plants decay, and at la&s;t to die. Some plants
were nouri&s;hed with water, in which &s;al ammo|niac,
a volatile alkali, was di&s;&s;olved. The&s;e
grew al&s;o well for &s;ome time; but, like the
former, were de&s;troyed by the frequent reitera|tion
of it. Weak lime-water promoted the growth
of its plants more than common water. But wa|ter
completely &s;aturated with quick-lime, proved
more noxious than that which contained a &s;olu|tion
of fixed alkali; though le&s;s than that which
contained a &s;olution of volatile alkali. Hence ap|pears
the hurt of overdo&s;ing a field with quick|lime.
Urine promoted, for a long time, the
growth of its plants; and the mo&s;t putrid appear|ed
to have the &s;tronge&s;t effect: but at la&s;t, it to|tally
de&s;troyed them. Water impregnated with
putrid animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, did more
effectually promote the growth of its plants than
<PB N="321" REF="347">
any other &s;olution; and in every &s;tage of the pro|gre&s;s
appeared to be &s;alutary.</P>
<P>Rotation of crops in the &s;ame field, univer&s;ally
practi&s;ed, is what probably has promoted the o|pinion
of a &s;pecific nouri&s;hment. It has been ur|ged,
that if all plants live on the &s;ame food, the
&s;oil mu&s;t be exhau&s;ted by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of different
plants, as much as by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame
plant. This argument for a &s;pecific nouri&s;hment
has a formidable appearance; and in order to ob|viate
it, I found it nece&s;&s;ary to give peculiar at|tention
to that branch of hu&s;bandry, which is
done above<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Part 2. chap. 1. &sect; 3.</NOTE>. It is there made evident, that
change of &s;pecies is nece&s;&s;ary, not for food, but
for preventing degeneracy. It is not want of
food that makes a hor&s;e degenerate in Britain;
and as little want of food that makes wheat dege|nerate,
where &s;own without intermi&s;&s;ion in the
&s;ame field. Plants native to Britain never dege|nerate,
though always growing in the &s;ame &s;pot;
white clover, for example, nettles, broom, whins,
ru&s;hes, couch-gra&s;s, &amp;c. &amp;c. A bull-dog never
degenerates in Britain.</P>
<P>Animals from their food are divided into two
kinds, carnivorous and graminivorous. But I
di&s;cover no &s;uch di&s;tinction among plants. All of
them live upon the &s;ame food; and it mu&s;t be &s;o,
if the opinion of a &s;pecific nouri&s;hment be rejected.
<PB N="322" REF="348">
Certain &s;ub&s;tances are provided by nature for the
nouri&s;hment of plants. It is highly probable, that
a quantity was lodged originally on the &s;urface of
this earth, for nouri&s;hing the fir&s;t plants: whence
the fertility of virgin &s;oils, &s;uch as have never
been cultivated. This vegetable matter di&s;&s;olved
in water, and imbibed by plants, is communica|ted
to animals that feed on plants, and &s;et free
again by the death and putrefaction of the&s;e ani|mals.
The more volatile parts are attracted by
the air: &s;ome are &s;ucked in with air at the leaves
of plants: &s;ome are wa&s;hed down to the ground
by rain; and with it are &s;ucked in at the roots.
The le&s;s volatile parts, which the air does not at|tract,
are di&s;&s;olved in water, and with it are al&s;o
&s;ucked in. And thus the proce&s;s is continued
without end. This propo&s;ition of a common nou|ri&s;hment,
is firmly &s;upported by the following
facts. Fir&s;t, Plants of different kinds growing in
the &s;ame &s;pot, rob and &s;tarve each other; which
could not be, if each drew from the &s;oil a &s;epa|rate
nouri&s;hment. Second, Grafting and inocu|lating
demon&s;trate a common nouri&s;hment. If
the roots of the &s;tock imbibe tho&s;e juices only
that are proper for its own nouri&s;hment, the graft|ed
plant mu&s;t &s;tarve. The juices imbibed by the
former, nouri&s;h both; and the&s;e juices are by
each plant converted fir&s;t into &s;ap, and then into
its own &s;ub&s;tance. Third, Dung of putrefied ve|getables,
of whatever kind they be, is one ho|mogeneous
<PB N="323" REF="349">
&s;ub&s;tance; and yet vegetable dung
prepares the &s;oil equally for every &s;ort of plant.
I add a con&s;ideration of a kind that to me is al|ways
per&s;ua&s;ive: a common nouri&s;hment is not
only a more &s;imple but a more wi&s;e di&s;pen&s;ation
of Providence, than a peculiar food for each &s;pe|cies:
every plant grows not every where; and if
each &s;pecies required a peculiar food, a va&s;t &s;tock
of vegetable food would remain unu&s;ed; which is
not conformable to the frugality of nature, nor to
the wi&s;dom of Providence, which makes nothing
in vain.</P>
<P>But though all plants imbibe indifferently, e|very
&s;ub&s;tance that is di&s;&s;olved in water; it fol|lows
not, that every &s;uch &s;ub&s;tance, even where
innocent, is equally nouri&s;hing. Some &s;ub&s;tances
may be proper nouri&s;hment, &s;ome not: and it
may rationally be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the latter is
thrown off as excrement; which will &s;o far ju&s;tify
the notion of a &s;pecific nouri&s;hment. Why may
there not be a re&s;emblance in this particular, be|tween
plants and graminivorous animals? A
hor&s;e, an ox, a &s;heep, a goat, live all of them
on gra&s;s; but each of them have favourite gra&s;&s;es;
which they prefer before other kinds. Let ex|periments
be made, to try what is the mo&s;t &s;alu|tary
food for plants. A few experiments of that
kind are mentioned above; but to give &s;atisfac|tion,
they ought to be multiplied and extended to
plants of different kinds.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="350">
It is an opinion univer&s;ally received, that the
$ertility of a &s;oil, depends on the quantity it con|tains
of the food provided by nature for the nou|ri&s;hment
of plants, whether &s;pecific or common;
that when the quantity contained in any field
is exhau&s;ted by cropping, it is re&s;tored by
the plough, by dung, or by other manure;
and that to re&s;tore an exhau&s;ted field by
&s;uch means, is the &s;ole object of agriculture.
This opinion has a fair appearance: nor had I
ever a doubt about it, till the following con&s;i|derations
happened to occur. I do not much
reli&s;h the notion, that the number of plants grow|ing
at any time on this globe, mu&s;t be limited by
the quantity of vegetable food created originally
for their nouri&s;hment, nor that the quantity of
graminivorous animals mu&s;t be al&s;o &s;o limited; and
yet this mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, if plants have no
other food but what was thus originally provided
for them. But &s;uppo&s;ing this con&s;ideration not to
weigh with others as with me, there are other con|&s;iderations
that cannot fail to make an impre&s;&s;ion.
Some countries produce corn and cattle, not
only for the inhabitants, but for exportation. Ac|cording
to the pre&s;ent doctrine, the&s;e countries
mu&s;t long ago have been reduced to ab&s;olute bar|renne&s;s.
Egypt and Sicily were of old the gra|naries
of Italy; and va&s;t quantities of vegetable
food, converted into corn, were annually export|ed
from the&s;e countries, never to return. Yet
<PB N="325" REF="351">
we do not find that they are le&s;s prolific than
formerly. Sicily at pre&s;ent does not con&s;ume
at home above the &s;eventh part of its wheat:
the remainder is exported; and yet not the lea&s;t
&s;ymptom of approaching barrenne&s;s. Con&s;ider
the endle&s;s quantity of beef exported every year
from Corke in Ireland: whatever quantity of
vegetable food may originally have been &s;tored
up in that part of the i&s;land, it mu&s;t long ago have
been totally exhau&s;ted. I urge another objection
more general. Where-ever burying under ground
is the practice, the vegetable food contained in
the bodies of human beings is totally lo&s;t, not to
mention tho&s;e who peri&s;h at &s;ea. At that rate,
there mu&s;t be a gradual diminution of vegetable
food, &s;o as that in time the whole will be ex|hau&s;ted.
I add a fact that alone may be thought
&s;ufficient to convince any thinking per&s;on, that
plants mu&s;t be provided with &s;ome food be&s;ide
that originally created. In Scotland, there are
fields that pa&s;t memory have carried &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
crops of wheat, pea&s;e, barley, oats, without a
fallow, and without manure. And that there are
&s;uch fields in England and el&s;ewhere, is not to be
doubted. A field of nine or ten acres on the
river Carron, is &s;till more extraordinary. Up|on
it I &s;aw a good crop of oats almo&s;t ripe; and
by information it was the hundred and third crop
of oats without intermi&s;&s;ion, and without manure,
as far as was known. Now, whatever be the na|ture
<PB N="326" REF="352">
of &s;uch a &s;oil, its unremitted fertility cannot
be accounted for, from any &s;uppo&s;ed quantity of
vegetable food originally accumulated in it. It
is ea&s;y by manure to make &s;oil too rich for
corn: it vegetates without end, and the &s;eed has
not, before winter, time to ripen. But &s;uppo|&s;ing
the riche&s;t &s;oil to be proper for corn; yet
that vegetable food, however great the quantity,
mu&s;t in time be exhau&s;ted by cropping. Some
other provi&s;ion therefore mu&s;t be made by nature
for the nouri&s;hment of plants, be&s;ide the vege|table
food originally created.</P>
<P>Immen&s;e is the quantity of corn and &s;traw, that
during a century is produced in a &s;oil perpetually
$ertile. It is a puzzling que&s;tion, whence pro|ceeds
&s;uch a quantity of matter; for a new crea|tion
cannot be admitted. A perpetual effect mu&s;t
have a perpetual cau&s;e: the &s;oil mu&s;t receive ad|ditions
without end, to re&s;tore what is taken a|way
in corn without end. I am aware, that the
&s;malle&s;t portion of matter may by divi&s;ion be made
to occupy &s;pace without bounds. But ob&s;erve,
that the difficulty ari&s;es from weight, not from
bulk. Corn is a weighty &s;ub&s;tance; and the
corn produced on this globe from the beginning,
mu&s;t amount to a weight above computation: the
&s;mall portion re&s;tored to the ground in manure,
is a mere atom in compari&s;on. I have endea|voured
above to evince, that earth is not convert|ed
into corn: and here is an additional proof;
for &s;uch conver&s;ion would exhibit a very new
<PB N="327" REF="353">
&s;cene: in&s;tead of the hills &s;inking down gradually
into the vallies, the vallies would &s;ink rapidly
down from the hills. A perpetual effect, I have
ob&s;erved, mu&s;t have a perpetual cau&s;e: to pre|&s;erve
a &s;oil perpetually fertile, there mu&s;t be a
continual influx of vegetable food, to &s;upply what
is taken away by cropping. Whence comes that
vegetable food? where is it &s;tored up?</P>
<P>Air and water contribute to vegetation: let us
try to build on that foundation. Suppo&s;ing air
and water to be the food of plants, not meaning
to exclude what may be di&s;&s;olved in them, the
difficulty vani&s;hes, as air and water are inexhau&s;t|ible.
And why may not that &s;uppo&s;ition hold in
fact? I begin with air. Many plants grow to
perfection, without having any nouri&s;hment that
can be di&s;covered but air only. The hou&s;e-leek
grows from choice on a dry mud-wall, which
&s;urely affords no nouri&s;hment. A &s;pecies of the
&s;edum, requiring a hot-hou&s;e in winter, is never
watered. The wall-flower grows luxuriantly in
the &s;eams between large &s;quare &s;tones in old
buildings, from which all moi&s;ture is excluded
but what is in the air. Various kinds of mo&s;s
grow upon hard &s;tones, where they can have no
nouri&s;hment but from the air. It is an univer&s;al
opinion, that leguminous plants, before they &s;eed,
draw mo&s;t of their nouri&s;hment from the air.
Conformable to that opinion, Dr Hales, in his
curious Statical E&s;&s;ays, has made it evident, that
<PB N="328" REF="354">
every vegetable contains a quantity of air, which
adds to the weight as well as to the bulk. The
fixed air in a green pea, makes no le&s;s than a
third part of the weight. In wood, however old
or dry, air is found, very ob&s;ervable when &s;et
loo&s;e by fire. Here is one inexhau&s;tible &s;tore of
matter for compo&s;ing plants.</P>
<P>Water is a &s;till larger &s;tore. A plant regularly
watered, will grow vigorou&s;ly in the mo&s;t barren
&s;oil, even in dead &s;and. In Per&s;ia, very little rain
falls during &s;ummer, and the land is burnt up;
not a pile of gra&s;s to be &s;een. But plants there
regularly watered, grow exce&s;&s;ively. There are
many experiments of plants &s;et in gla&s;&s;es upon
mo&s;s or &s;punge, which grow well when watered.
Some cotton was &s;pread on water in a phial: a
pea dropped on it &s;prung, and pu&s;hed roots
through the cotton into the water. The plant
grew vigorou&s;ly, and bears at pre&s;ent large pods
full of ripe &s;eed. There is a noted experiment
of an oak growing in pure water to the height of
eighteen feet. Water is attracted by vegetables
of every kind; and is &s;ucked in at the roots, at
the leaves, and even at the bark. The quantity
imbibed during a &s;pring and a &s;ummer, is ama|zing.
The quantity exhaled every day, is accu|rately
mea&s;ured in the Statical E&s;&s;ays mentioned;
which mu&s;t be le&s;s than what is imbibed, becau&s;e
plants do not throw off all they imbibe, part be|ing
converted into their &s;ub&s;tance, and adding to
<PB N="329" REF="355">
their bulk and weight<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The emi&s;&s;ion of water from plants, is the occa&s;ion that a country abounding with trees, is more &s;ubject to damps, humid air, and frequent rain, than a bare conn|try where no trees grow. The exce&s;&s;ive moi&s;ture of the American air was a great annoyance to our fir&s;t &s;ettlers; but the air became more dry, and the weather more con&s;tent, as the ground was cleared of trees.</NOTE>. The drie&s;t wood ac|cordingly
yields, by di&s;tillation, a large propor|tion
of water. A &s;tream occupies the lowe&s;t
ground, without regard to &s;oil; and yet the gra&s;s
on its borders is always more rich and verdant
than at a di&s;tance. A tree grows no where more
vigorou&s;ly than at the &s;ide of a brook. About a
large &s;tone fixed in the ground, the gra&s;s is ge|nerally
the be&s;t in the field: for what other rea|&s;on,
than that the rain which falls on the &s;tone
runs off to the &s;ides? I do not &s;ay, that the heat
of the &s;tone during &s;ummer may not contribute
&s;omewhat. The north &s;ide of a hill, is ob&s;erved
to be commonly better &s;oil than the &s;outh &s;ide:
if there be truth in the ob&s;ervation, it mu&s;t pro|ceed
from moi&s;ture, le&s;s being evaporated from
the former than from the latter. Black &s;olid peat|mo&s;s
retains moi&s;ture like a &s;punge: trees grow
vigorou&s;ly in it, provided they be &s;heltered from
wind; for their roots cannot re&s;i&s;t wind in a &s;oil
&s;o tender and loo&s;e. On the other hand, no &s;oil
is more barren than a gravelly or &s;andy moor that
holds no water; upon which the foot makes no
<PB N="330" REF="356">
impre&s;&s;ion, not even after a heavy &s;hower. I am
bu&s;y at pre&s;ent in cultivating a moor of that kind,
upon which are &s;cattered &s;ome dwarfi&s;h plants of
heath and bent, that leave half of the &s;urface
bare. I judged that manure would not an&s;wer, till
the field &s;hould be made to retain moi&s;ture; for
which rea&s;on I incorporated with it a quantity of
&s;oft &s;pungy earth. I added lime and dung; and
now it carries a rich crop of turnip and cabbage.
The alteration of the &s;oil is obvious to the eye;
and al&s;o to feeling, as the foot dips in it after e|very
&s;hower. Lord Bacon long ago gave his opi|nion,
that for nouri&s;hing vegetables, water is al|mo&s;t
all in all; and that the earth &s;erves but to
keep the plant upright, and to pre&s;erve it from
too much heat or too much cold.</P>
<P>To &s;upply the endle&s;s quantity of moi&s;ture ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for vegetation, nature has made ample
provi&s;ion. The continual circulation of water up|on
this globe, from its &s;urface to the atmo&s;phere,
and down again to the &s;urface, is ju&s;tly admired
for the &s;implicity of its cau&s;e, no le&s;s than for its
bountiful effects. An elective attraction between
air and water, is the <HI>primum mobile</HI> of the&s;e ef|fects
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Edinburgh Phy&s;ical E&s;&s;ays, vol. 3. art. 4.</NOTE>. Water is eight hundred times heavier
than air; and yet by that &s;ingle power, an im|men&s;e
quantity of water is &s;u&s;pended in air; and
falls down from time to time in rain, dew, and
<PB N="331" REF="357">
&s;now, impregnating the earth with moi&s;ture. Dr
Hales, in a dry July, dug up a cubic foot of
brick-earth, weighing one hundred and four
pounds, which contained &s;ix pounds and eleven
ounces of water. Under the former he dug up
another cubic foot, weighing one hundred and
&s;ix pounds and &s;ix ounces, which contained ten
pounds of water. Under this he dug up a third
cubic foot, weighing one hundred and eleven
pounds and one third, which contained eight
pounds and eight ounces of water. Here is a
con&s;iderable &s;tock of moi&s;ture, &s;ufficient without
rain to afford vegetable nouri&s;hment &s;everal
weeks; not to mention what may be attracted
from below, by the upper &s;tratum when its moi|&s;ture
is exhau&s;ted. Evaporation goes on &s;o ra|pidly
between the tropics, that to pre&s;erve
plants alive, moi&s;ture mu&s;t be attracted from be|low;
for, as mentioned in the fir&s;t chapter of this
part, there is an elective attraction between earth
and water; and where a portion of earth is &s;atura|ted
with water, it readily yields its &s;uper&s;luous
water to a dry body in contact with it. This a&s;|cent
of moi&s;ture is promoted by the heat of the
&s;un, which pierces deeper into the earth than two
feet, according to experiments made by Dr Hales.
Were not plants thus &s;upplied with moi&s;ture in
the torrid zone, where no rain falls for many
months, they would be de&s;troyed by the &s;corch|ing
heat of the &s;un. The evening dew that falls
<PB N="332" REF="358">
in a hot &s;ummer, is &s;ucked up the following day,
without ever &s;inking to the roots of plants.</P>
<P>But though air and water are allotted by nature
as the con&s;tant and inexhau&s;tible food of plants,
there &s;eems to be little doubt but that this food
may be inriched by various &s;ub&s;tances di&s;&s;olved
in them. We have &s;een above, that water im|pregnated
with rotten animal and vegetable &s;ub|&s;tances,
makes rich nouri&s;hment for plants; and
from experiments, other &s;ub&s;tances may probably
be di&s;covered, equally efficacious. Plain water
may be &s;ufficient for the &s;tem, branches, and o|ther
gro&s;s parts; but we have rea&s;on to think,
that richer nutritive matter is nece&s;&s;ary for per|fecting
the &s;eed. Hence the imperfection of &s;eed
in a rainy year, where the rich matter bears no
proportion to the quantity of water that pa&s;&s;es
through a plant.</P>
<P>Moderate rain in a kindly &s;ea&s;on, warms tilled
land, and produces a &s;light fermentation. It is
here as in a dunghill: a very little quantity of
moi&s;ture has &s;carce any effect: a great quantity
chills the ground, in&s;tead of warming it. Differ|ent
plants require different quantities of moi&s;ture.
Gra&s;s is benefited by all it receives; provided the
moi&s;ture exceed not &s;o much, as to chill the ground
and the roots of the plants<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">A gra&s;s plant cannot retain &s;o much as to hurt it: whatever is imbibed more than &s;ufficient for nouri&s;hment, per&s;pires at the leaves. There is a con&s;iderable lati|tude in the quantity of healthy per&s;piration; which, in the &s;un-flower, by an experiment of Dr Hales, appears to be from &s;ixteen to twenty-eight ounce in twelve hours day. And he adds, that the more it was watered the more it per&s;pired.</NOTE>. So far corn re|&s;embles
<PB N="333" REF="359">
gra&s;s, as to be &s;lunted by lack of moi|&s;ture,
and con&s;equently to blanch early. The
&s;eed has more than time to ripen; but it is lank
and ill filled. Corn differs in being hurt by
much moi&s;ture: it vegetates continually; and
winter comes on before the &s;eed begins to ripen.
Holland is a moi&s;t country: there is &s;carce a foot
of dry ground in it. Trees, gra&s;s, and vege|tables,
grow there luxuriantly: but its fruits &s;el|dom
ripen: and where ripe, have little ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Thus from air and water, with what they con|tain,
there is an inexhau&s;tible &s;upply of vegetable
nouri&s;hment, which fairly accounts for the im|men&s;e
quantity of corn that is annually produ|ced.</P>
<P>The &s;un joins with air and water in nouri&s;hing
plants. The green colour of plants is occa&s;ioned
by an oily &s;ub&s;tance, which can be &s;eparated by a
chymical operation; and that oily &s;ub&s;tance is ow|ing
to the &s;un, for no plant is green where the
&s;un is excluded. The &s;un therefore contributes
to advance plants to perfection. And it is one of
the properties of leguminous plants, that their
broad leaves ab&s;orb more of the &s;un's rays, than
the narrow leaves of culmiferous plants.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="360">
According to the foregoing theory, the only
u&s;e of a &s;oil, is to fix the roots of plants, and to
hold water for nouri&s;hment. But at that rate,
where lies the difference between a rich and a
poor &s;oil? This globe is &s;urrounded with air,
and rain pays not homage to one field in prefer|ence
to another? The &s;olution of this que&s;tion
will, if I be not gro&s;sly mi&s;taken, confirm the
foregoing theory, and evince that it is founded
on truth. Soils originally may have been very
different with re&s;pect to fertility, &s;uppo&s;ing vege|table
food to have been unequally di&s;tributed by
the hand of nature. A virgin &s;oil may be ex|tremely
rich; witne&s;s the &s;urpri&s;ing fertility of
America, when agriculture was introduced there.
But cultivated grounds mu&s;t long ago have been
deprived of that original food, in the cour&s;e of
cropping; after which, it does not enter into
my conception, what other circum&s;tance can re|main
to make a &s;oil fertile, but the holding water
in &s;ufficient quanity for its plants. A clay &s;oil
holds a great quantity; a &s;andy &s;oil, very little.
Some &s;oils there are &s;ingularly retentive of moi|&s;ture,
and that quality makes them long of dry|ing:
&s;uch &s;oils are favourable to vegetation; for
though they re&s;i&s;t drought, they yield to the at|traction
of plants<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">May it not be thought, that the quantity of moi&s;ture which gives to a &s;oil its highe&s;t &s;ermentation, is at the &s;ame time the fitte&s;t for perfecting &s;eed. However plea|&s;ing this conjecture may be, I dare not vouch it for truth: it mu&s;t be left to experiment.</NOTE>. Other &s;oils are very little
<PB N="335" REF="361">
retentive of moi&s;ture: they dry in an in&s;tant, and
the nouri&s;hment they can afford is very &s;canty.
Here the my&s;tery is unfolded. The riche&s;t &s;oil is
what gives the greate&s;t re&s;i&s;tence to a drying air,
and at the &s;ame time furni&s;hes to its plants their
proper quantity of moi&s;ture. I have a thorough
conviction, that this property belongs to a &s;oil
perpetually fertile: and it is to me a &s;trong con|firmation
of the pre&s;ent theory, that I cannot
form even the &s;lighte&s;t conception, how perpetual
fertility can otherwi&s;e be accounted for; and as
little can I form a conception, how otherwi&s;e
countries, like Poland or Livonia, out of which
great cargoes are annually exported of corn and
flax&s;eed, &s;hould &s;uffer no diminution of fertility.</P>
<P>To recruit with vegetable food a &s;oil impoveri&s;h|ed
by cropping, has hitherto been held the only
object of agriculture. But here opens a grander
object, worthy to employ our keene&s;t indu&s;try,
that of making a &s;oil perpetually fertile. Such
&s;oils actually exi&s;t: and why &s;hould it be thought,
that imitation here is above the reach of art?
Many are the in&s;tances of nature being imitated
with &s;ucce&s;s: let us not de&s;pair while any hope
remains; for invention never was exerted upon a
&s;ubject of greater utility. The attempt may &s;ug|ge&s;t
proper experiments: it may open new views;
<PB N="336" REF="362">
and if we fail in equalling nature, may we not
however hope to approach it? A &s;oil perpetual|ly
fertile, mu&s;t be endowed with a power to retain
moi&s;ture &s;ufficient for its plants; and at the &s;ame
time mu&s;t be of a nature that does not harden by
moi&s;ture. Calcarious earth promi&s;es to an&s;wer
both ends: it prevents a &s;oil from being harden|ed
by water; and it may probably al&s;o envigorate
its retentive faculty. A field that got a &s;ufficient
do&s;e of clay marl, carried above thirty &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
rich crops, without either dung or fallow. Doth
not a &s;oil &s;o meliorated draw near to one perpe|tually
fertile? Near the ea&s;t &s;ide of Fife, the
coa&s;t for a mile inward is covered with &s;ea &s;and, a
foot deep or &s;o; which is extremely fertile, by a
mixture of &s;ea &s;hells, reduced to powder by attri|tion.
The powdered &s;hells, being the &s;ame with
&s;hell-marl, make the &s;and retentive of moi&s;ture;
and yet no quantity of moi&s;ture will unite the &s;and
into a &s;olid body. A &s;oil &s;o mixed &s;eems to be
not far di&s;tant from one perpetually fertile. The&s;e,
it is true, are at be&s;t but faint e&s;&s;ays; but what
will not per&s;everance accompli&s;h in a good cau&s;e?</P>
<P>A &s;oil is denominated fertile, that affords plenty
of nouri&s;hment to its plants; and accordingly it
is &s;uch a &s;oil only that has been the &s;ubject of the
foregoing inve&s;tigation. Plants that live mo&s;tly
on air, require not &s;uch a &s;oil; witne&s;s the hou&s;e|leek
mentioned above. Juniper thrives on the
top of a mountain, in the poore&s;t and drie&s;t &s;oil;
<PB N="337" REF="363">
becau&s;e, in that &s;ituation, it is &s;ufficiently &s;upplied
with moi&s;ture from the air. If planted in a dry
climate, it requires a moi&s;t &s;oil, to &s;upply the want
of a moi&s;t atmo&s;phere. The nature of the yew
is the &s;ame. Planted in a valley, it requires a
damp &s;oil. It will grow in the drie&s;t &s;oil, as in
the cleft of a rock; but then it mu&s;t be at &s;uch a
height, as to enjoy a very humid air. The&s;e are a
&s;pecimen of plants, that affect to grow in a &s;oil
commonly reckoned barren. A &s;oil that a mere
farmer would pronounce barren, is for many
plants excellent. How otherwi&s;e could the earth
be every where cloathed with beauty? How
great mu&s;t be the diver&s;ity of &s;oil, climate, and
&s;ituation, that can ri&s;e to perfection above 20,000
kinds of plants, to each of which is requi&s;ite
&s;ome peculiarity of &s;oil, of climate, or of &s;itua|tion!</P>
<P>Whether the theory here exhibited will occa|&s;ion
any material alteration in the practice of agri|culture,
mu&s;t be left to the di&s;covery of time.
Of one thing I am firmly convinced, that the in|&s;tructions
above delivered, are in every particular
conformable to that theory. Take the following
&s;light &s;pecimen. Plants, like animals, cannot
live long in the &s;ame air: a circulation is to both
equally requi&s;ite. For that rea&s;on, the growth of
plants under cover, is &s;low; and &s;eed &s;prings
&s;lowly in &s;tagnated air. Conformable to this ob|&s;ervation,
a free circulation of air for corn is
<PB N="338" REF="364">
warmly recommended; and there is a caveat a|gain&s;t
&s;mall inclo&s;ures, &s;urrounded with &s;trips of
planting, becau&s;e they occa&s;ion a &s;tagnation of
air. Impure air imbibed, renders a plant u$|healthy:
the grain has a bad ta&s;te, and tends to
generate di&s;ea&s;es; which holds remarkably in a
fruit-orchard, if the trees be crouded, and the
walls high. Even gra&s;s, where the air &s;tagnates,
is unpalatable and unwhole&s;ome. Next, with re|&s;pect
to moi&s;ture. No branch of hu&s;bandry is
more &s;edulou&s;ly inculcated, than that of dividing
and pulverizing earth by the plough, by the brake,
by harrows, and by manure: it is the very life of
agriculture. And from what is laid down above,
it appears, that fertility depends greatly on that
practice<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Part 2. ch. 1. &s;ect. 1.</NOTE>: it increa&s;es the capacity of &s;oil to con|tain
water: it envigorates its retentive power;
and it prevents the &s;oil from hardening: to the&s;e
ends manure greatly contributes; and in that
view it makes the &s;ubject of the following chapter.</P>
<P>To aid the fertility of &s;oil, the pickling &s;eed has
been much practi&s;ed. We li&s;ten readily to the
marvelous, e&s;pecially where any great advantage
is promi&s;ed. The boa&s;ted effects of the Abb&eacute;
de Valemont's prolific liquor, found many belie|vers,
by which va&s;t crops were to be reaped, with|out
manure, and almo&s;t without ploughing. (See
Duhamel's treati&s;e on the culture of land, vol. 6.).
<PB N="339" REF="365">
And the Baron de Haac's powder, is at pre&s;ent
no le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful in England. The credulity of
farmers might in &s;ome mea&s;ure be excu&s;able,
were &s;uch bold preten&s;ions within the verge of
po&s;&s;ibility. In every &s;eed there is an embryo
plant; and the re&s;t of the &s;eed &s;erves to feed that
plant, till it acquire roots for drawing its nouri&s;h|ment
from the &s;oil. The pulp is thus exhau&s;ted,
and there remains only the u&s;ele&s;s hu&s;k. What
advantage then can be derived from a prolific li|quor
or powder? It may po&s;&s;ibly render the pulp
fitter to feed the young plant, till it &s;trike root.
That it can have no other effect is evident; fir&s;t,
becau&s;e it is exhau&s;ted with the &s;eed; and, next,
that &s;uppo&s;ing any of it to remain, it can be of
no benefit to roots that are &s;pread an inch, two,
or three, from the place where the &s;eed was laid.
Yet books of agriculture are &s;tuffed with &s;uch re|ceipts.</P>
<P>I clo&s;e this chapter with a reflection of the ju&s;t|ly-e&s;teemed
Dr Hales. &startq;Though I am &s;en&s;ible,
that from experience chiefly we are to expect
the mo&s;t certain rules of practice; yet the
likelie&s;t method for making the mo&s;t judicious
ob&s;ervations, and for improving any art, is to
get the be&s;t in&s;ight we can into the nature and
properties of what we are de&s;irous to cultivate
and improve.&endq;</P>

<P>AS the&s;e means are ploughing and manuring,

<DIV4>
<HEAD>1. PLOUGHING.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are mutual connections between man
and the ground he treads on, that fit them for
each other. The dry part of this globe, is every
where covered with a <HI>&s;tratum</HI> of earth, produ|cing
vegetables for the nouri&s;hment of man and of
other animals. Some <HI>&s;trata</HI> there are, &s;o barren
as not to bear vegetables; and &s;ome vegetables
there are, that afford no nouri&s;hment: but both
are rare, and intended probably for other pur|po&s;es.</P>
<P>This <HI>&s;tratum</HI> is commonly &s;ufficiently deep for a
free cour&s;e to the roots of plants: or it may be
made &s;o by art, it being one of the many pur|po&s;es
of agriculture to deepen a &s;hallow &s;oil. A
deep &s;oil, be&s;ide giving free cour&s;e to roots, re|tains
much water to nouri&s;h them. In Scotland,
partly from ignorance, partly from defect of
&s;trength, it is the general practice to plough with
a &s;hallow furrow, commonly under four inches;
<PB N="341" REF="367">
and hitherto the progre&s;s toward a better mode
has been &s;low. It is never difficult to invent rea|&s;ons
for ju&s;tifying what we are accu&s;tomed to.
&startq;If we plough deep, we are afraid of till.&endq; And
what is till? Where ground is &s;tiff, rain &s;et|tling
at the bottom of the furrow cements the
earth under it, which in time is hardened to a
&s;tone; and it is this hardened earth which is na|med
till. The earth is hardened as far as the
water penetrates, which may be one or two
inches; but after till is formed, every drop of
rain re&s;ts upon it without making any impre&s;&s;ion.
To &s;ubdue till is an important object; and luckily
the undertaking is &s;eldom difficult: a &s;trong
plough, rai&s;ing it to the &s;urface, lays it open to
the &s;un, air, and fro&s;t, which re&s;tore it to its o|riginal
&s;tate. One precaution is nece&s;&s;ary. Cer|tain
earths, as hinted above, are aver&s;e to vege|tation.
The&s;e mu&s;t be avoided, however &s;hallow
the &s;oil be: but as &s;uch earths are rare, they
ought not to be an excu&s;e for &s;hallow ploughing.</P>
<P>The advantages of deep ploughing, are mani|fold.
In the fir&s;t place, roots extend far where
they meet no re&s;i&s;tance; and the growth above
the &s;urface corre&s;ponds to that below: roots
cramped in a &s;hallow &s;oil, are dwarfi&s;h; and con|&s;equently
&s;o is the tree. Dr Hales ju&s;tly ob&s;erves,
that the greater proportion the &s;urface of the roots
bears to that of the tree, the greater is the vi|gour
<PB N="342" REF="368">
of the tree, and the better able to re&s;i&s;t the
attacks of an unkindly &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>In the next place, a deep &s;oil affords not only
&s;pace for roots, but holds a due proportion of
water for nouri&s;hing the plant. If more rain fall
than the &s;oil can retain, it de&s;cends to the bottom
of the furrow, where it lies lower than the roots,
or but barely touches their extremities: the &s;ea|&s;on
mu&s;t be very wet, that rai&s;es the water &s;o high
as to do much damage. The di&s;advantage of a
&s;hallow &s;oil is in that re&s;pect very great. Roots
accu&s;tomed to earth are unqualified to grow in
water: they &s;uffer when &s;oaked in water; which
mu&s;t often happen in a &s;hallow &s;oil, and is vi&s;ible
above ground by a &s;ickly yellow hue<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Part 2. chap. 1. &s;ect. 2.</NOTE>. Upon
that account, Miller enters a caveat again&s;t over|watering
tran&s;planted trees: &startq;it rots the young
fibres,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;as fa&s;t as they grow.&endq; Dr
Hales gives the &s;ame le&s;&s;on. There is another
di&s;advantage of a &s;hallow &s;oil: the water lodges
&s;o near the &s;urface, as &s;oon to be exhaled in dry
weather. Thus, the exce&s;&s;es of moi&s;ture and of
drought, are both of them incident to a &s;hallow
&s;oil. In a deep &s;oil, water lodged at the bottom of
the furrow, is a re&s;ervoir, which is not exhau&s;ted
but by long drought. La&s;tly, a deep &s;oil affords
&s;pace for placing the &s;eed &s;o, as that the roots may
&s;pread every way: in a &s;hallow &s;oil, if the &s;eed
<PB N="343" REF="369">
be laid &s;o deep as to be &s;ufficiently covered, it ap|proaches
the hard bottom, unkindly to tender
roots.</P>
<P>So much for a deep &s;oil. I proceed to other
advantages of ploughing. Stiff &s;oil is not pene|trable
by water: loo&s;e &s;oil does not retain it.
Ploughing dimini&s;hes the tenacity of the former,
and opens it to receive water: it makes the latter
more compact, and increa&s;es its power of retain|ing
water. Some earths fill not the hole out of
which they were dug: &s;ome do more than fill it.
Poro&s;ity occa&s;ions the former: the pores are di|mini&s;hed
by handling, which makes it more com|pact.
Solidity occa&s;ions the latter: clay &s;wells by
&s;tirring; and continues &s;o, till its former &s;olidity
be re&s;tored by the power of gravity<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This experiment ought to be tried upon ground that has re&s;ted many years. Among the cau&s;es of poro&s;ity, one is, the great number of infects that have their dwell|ing under ground, and are expert miners. I &s;peak not of moles and mice, who&s;e &s;ubterranean walks and alleys are obvious to the eye; but of worms, beetles, ants, wa&s;ps, &amp;c. who&s;e works e&s;cape ob&s;ervation. Their ex|cavations may in a long tract of time render the &s;oil ex|tremely porous. The fine earth they dig out, is left up|on the &s;urface, and blown away by the wind.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Another advantage of ploughing regards clay
chiefly, which by moi&s;ture turns hard if not duly
&s;tirred. This is an important article. Sand has
<PB N="344" REF="370">
no cohe&s;ion; and dry clay very little, if any<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Part 2. chap. 1. &s;ect. 1.</NOTE>.
It is water that cements clay; and in ploughing
makes it ri&s;e in lumps or clods, great or &s;mall in
proportion to the degree of cohe&s;ion. Ploughing
prevents water from binding a clay-&s;oil: the &s;u|perfluous
moi&s;ture is exhaled by frequent plough|ing,
and no more left but to give the clay a de|gree
of cohe&s;ion &s;ufficient for fixing the roots.
The nice point is, the time of applying the plough
after much rain. To plough wet, kneads the
parts together: on the other hand, the ground
mu&s;t not be &s;uffered to turn hard. Between &s;oft
and hard is the proper condition for ploughing;
which may be known by the mouldering of the
earth that is rai&s;ed by the plough. During win|ter,
clay may be &s;tirred in a moi&s;ter &s;tate, than
during &s;ummer: fro&s;t prevents cohe&s;ion: heat
promotes it. The management of light &s;oil is
very different. It is ea&s;ily pulverized; but the dif|ficulty
is to pre&s;erve its moi&s;ture. A long drought,
by extracting much of its moi&s;ture, renders it
the le&s;s fit for vegetation; and to plough it in
that &s;tate in dry weather, would render it entirely
unfit. The only remedy is rain; and if drought
&s;et in, it ought to be rolled immediately after
ploughing.</P>
<P>The proper time of &s;owing and harrowing, is
when there is no more moi&s;ture than &s;ufficient to
<PB N="345" REF="371">
give the &s;oil a proper con&s;i&s;tence; and I conjec|ture,
that the &s;ame degree of moi&s;ture is the &s;it|te&s;t
for making the &s;eed &s;pring. Reflect upon the
making of malt: a certain degree of moi&s;ture is
nece&s;&s;ary for fermentation: too much checks it.
Let rolling immediately follow, to prevent as
much as po&s;&s;ible any more evaporation. Where
&s;eed is to be &s;own in winter, or early in &s;pring,
it is right to plough &s;ometime before, in order
that the &s;uperfluous moi&s;ture may evaporate; for
at that &s;ea&s;on there is no fear of exhau&s;ting the
moi&s;ture. But late in the &s;pring, if the &s;ea&s;on be
dry, &s;ow the &s;eed immediately after ploughing.
The plants in their cour&s;e of growing, return to
the &s;oil, during night, part of the moi&s;ture they
draw from it during day. Their roots at the
&s;ame time, &s;preading in every direction, keep the
&s;oil in con&s;tant motion, and prevent it from turn|ing
hard.</P>
<P>I clo&s;e this &s;ection with an effect of ploughing
the mo&s;t important of all, becau&s;e it holds in all
&s;oils le&s;s or more. Ploughing keeps the &s;oil loo&s;e
for roots to take their natural cour&s;e, and open
for admitting air, dew, and rain. Dew in parti|cular,
which falls in plenty during &s;ummer, when
mo&s;t wanted, is lo&s;t upon hard &s;oil, being exha|led
by the next &s;un; but it &s;inks deep into loo&s;e
&s;oil, and is &s;heltered from the &s;un's power.
Ground &s;tirred before winter, is not only laid o|pen
<PB N="346" REF="372">
to the action of the &s;un, wind, and fro&s;t, but
is early ready for a &s;pring crop, beans for ex|ample.
It &s;oon wets indeed, but it dries as &s;oon.
To drench in water ground left un&s;tirred, may
require a month or two; but then, equal time
is required to dry it. The more earth is pul|verized,
the more water it holds<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Part 2. chap. 1. &s;ect. 1.</NOTE>; and the
more parts water is divided into, the more readily
it is imbibed by plants. If the ground be ren|dered
too loo&s;e, rolling not only makes it &s;olid to
&s;ecure the plants again&s;t wind, but al&s;o prevents
evaporation.</P>
<P>How beneficial it is to keep &s;oil open for the
admi&s;&s;ion of nutritive matter, will appear from
the following facts. Stiff &s;oil gains little by re&s;t;
for as rain and dew get no admittance, they are
&s;oon carried off by evaporation. But &s;oil, if to|lerably
open, improves by re&s;t. I &s;u&s;pect that it
gains little by the pa&s;turing of cattle; for what
they take away in fat with what they per&s;pire, will
nearly balance the dung they leave: but it gains
by the nutritive matter that rain and dew depo&s;it
in it: the rain may evaporate, but it leaves the
nutritive matter. This ca&s;e re&s;embles &s;alt depo&s;i|ted
in the &s;ea by rivers: water is evaporated
from the &s;ea, but the &s;alt is left behind; and
hence the &s;altne&s;s of the &s;ea. The nutritive mat|ter
thus left in the earth, is again deluted in rain|water;
<PB N="347" REF="373">
and though not attracted by the air, is
attracted by plants, and enters into the ori$ices of
the roots along with the water in which it is di&s;|&s;olved.
There is another cau&s;e that has a &s;hare
in the improvement of an open &s;oil, and that is
air, which, with its contents, enters into the
bo&s;om of an open &s;oil by attraction<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Part 1. ch. 1. &s;ect. 1.</NOTE>. The o|peration
is indeed &s;low, becau&s;e the attraction has
no effect but in contact or near it; yet in time,
the quantity of nutritive matter attracted with air,
may be con&s;iderable. Du Hamel reports, that
the rubbi&s;h of a mud wall made good manure,
though the mud had been taken from a very
poor &s;oil. Gra&s;&s;y &s;od, u&s;ed as a covering for cot|tages,
turns good manure when it has lain
long upon a hou&s;e. The walls of a fold for
&s;heep, being compo&s;ed of &s;od, make good ma|nure:
when thrown down and mixed with the
&s;oil, they afford a better crop than the fold with|in,
though enriched by the dung of the &s;heep.
Among many advantages of fallowing, the ex|po&s;ing
to the air a new &s;urface from time to time,
is one; by that means, every part of the &s;oil
draws air with the vegetable food it contains.</P>

<HEAD>2. MANURES.</HEAD>
<P>THE operations of nature, hid from the igno|rant,
and not always obvious to the learned,
<PB N="348" REF="374">
break out &s;ometimes into broad day-light. Did
animal bodies after death wither and dry without
di&s;&s;olving, this earth could not long have been
a habitation for men: their utmo&s;t efforts would
have been in&s;ufficient to remove dead carca&s;es out
of the way. Happily putrefaction comes to their
relief: dead bodies di&s;&s;olve and mix with the &s;oil,
without leaving a trace behind. Putrefaction is
a curious proce&s;s of nature: air, moi&s;ture, heat,
all of them, contribute; but too much, or too
little, is an impediment to the proce&s;s.</P>
<P>On the &s;urface of this globe, a proce&s;s is conti|nually
going on, unregarded by the vulgar, being
too familiar to draw their attention; and yet, il|lu&s;trious
among the works of Providence for its
bene&s;icial effects. Plants and animals are gene|rated,
arrive at maturity; and after &s;erving the
purpo&s;es of nature, decay and rot. But the
proce&s;s ends not there. Loath&s;ome putrid mat|ter,
from which we avert the eye, is made &s;ub&s;er|vient
to an excellent purpo&s;e, viz. renovation of
plants; and the proce&s;s goes on without end.</P>
<P>Manures are of two kinds. One attracts wa|ter
and is attracted by it, dung for example, &s;alt,
calcined lime&s;tone commonly called <HI>quicklime,</HI>
or &s;imply, <HI>lime.</HI> Another neither attracts water
nor is attracted by it, &s;hell-marl for example, clay-marl,
&s;tone-marl, raw $word$ one beat into pow|der.</P>
<P>Of all manures, dung is the mo&s;t univer&s;al. A
<PB N="349" REF="375">
&s;oil naturally &s;tiff turns free and open, in propor|tion
to the quantity of dung be&s;towed on it. Re|duce
clay into a dry powder: moi&s;ten it with wa|ter,
and form it into a ball: repeat the operation
at plea&s;ure, it &s;till returns to its original hardne&s;s.
But moi&s;ten it once or twice with the juice of a
dunghill, it becomes mellow, and never recovers
its hardne&s;s. Dung therefore renders clay fertile,
by opening it and giving admi&s;&s;ion to water. It
does more: it makes every &s;oil retentive of water.
Examine a kitchen-garden that has been often
dunged in the cour&s;e of cropping: it will be found
moi&s;t above any neighbouring ground of the fame
original &s;oil.</P>
<P>As dung is compo&s;ed of putrefied vegetables or
of animal excrements, it is natural to think that it
contains more or le&s;s vegetable food. This how|ever
goes not beyond a conjecture: a plant or an
animal may contain abundance of vegetable food;
but we are not certain that this is the ca&s;e after
putrefaction: it may by that proce&s;s be converted
into a different &s;ub&s;tance: &s;uch conver&s;ions in na|tural
operations, are far from being rare. But if
vegetable food be contained in dung, which is the
mo&s;t likely, another u&s;e of it is to depo&s;it in the
ground its vegetable food, which, being di&s;&s;olved
in water, is imbibed by plants, and converted into
their &s;ub&s;tance. And from an experiment men|tioned
above it appears, that water impregnated
<PB N="350" REF="376">
with dung, is of all the greate&s;t nouri&s;her of
plants.</P>
<P>A third u&s;e of dung is, to promote vegetation
by rai&s;ing a kindly heat in the ground. The &s;un|rays
produce the &s;ame effect upon ground render|ed
black by culture; for it is a property of all
black bodies to attract and ab&s;orb rays of the
&s;un<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Part 2. chap. 1. &s;ect. 1.</NOTE>. Heat is be&s;t promoted by hot dung;
which therefore &s;eems the mo&s;t proper for corn.
Whether hot dung be the be&s;t for making a &s;oil
retentive of moi&s;ture, remains to be a&s;certained
by experiments. But I incline to think, that
dung thoroughly putrefied, and con&s;equently cool,
is in its be&s;t condition for gra&s;s; as it can be e|qually
&s;pread to give every plant its &s;hare. It is
al&s;o in its be&s;t condition for a kitchen-garden:
green dung infects pot-herbs with an un&s;avoury
ta&s;te, and &s;ometimes with a di&s;agreeable &s;mell.</P>
<P>Let a dunghill remain years without &s;tirring:
it is reduced in appearance to fine earth; which
however has very little natural earth in it, as there
is very little natural earth in vegetables, or in ani|mals
that feed on vegetables. Very few natural
earths equal this vegetable earth in fertility: and it
is a kind di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence, not only that
dung is a great fertilizer, but that when it be|comes
vegetable earth, it proves the be&s;t &s;oil for
vegetables. In corn-countries, the &s;urface-earth
<PB N="351" REF="377">
comes in time to be mo&s;tly vegetable: were it
inferior to natural earth, corn-countries would
long ago have been rendered barren and unfit for
agriculture.</P>
<P>From dung I proceed to other manures. Lime|&s;tone,
&s;hell-marl, clay-marl, &s;tone-marl, are all
of them a compo&s;ition of calcarious earth with
other &s;ub&s;tances. Sand with calcarious earth
makes lime&s;tone<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I have heard of lime&s;tone almo&s;t entirely calcarious, with little or no mixture of &s;and.</NOTE>. The &s;hells of fi&s;h are almo&s;t
entirely calcarious; and the&s;e &s;hells &s;oftened and
reduced to powder in water, are called <HI>&s;hell-marl.</HI>
Clay-marl is a compo&s;ition of calcarious earth and
clay. Stone-marl is a compo&s;ition of clay, &s;and,
and calcarious earth: it is the &s;and that hardens
it; and according to the proportion of &s;and, it
approaches to lime&s;tone or to clay-marl<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Dr Ain&s;lie's accurate e&s;&s;ay on marl. Edinburgh E&s;&s;ays phy&s;ical and literary, vol. 3. art. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved above, that powdered clay is
&s;u&s;pended in water, till by the &s;uperior force of
gravity it fall to the bottom<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Part 2. chap. 1. &s;ect. 1.</NOTE>. But, as far as I
know, water has not the power of di&s;&s;olving any
&s;ort of earth, calcined lime&s;tone alone excepted.
A &s;mall quantity of calcined lime&s;tone, a pound
for example, will impregnate a va&s;t quantity of
water, with no lo&s;s of bulk, and with a lo&s;s of
weight &s;carce perceptible. Calcined lime&s;tone
<PB N="352" REF="378">
thus impregnated, called <HI>lime-water,</HI> di&s;covers it|&s;elf
to the ta&s;te, though not to the eye. But this
effect is confined to calcined lime&s;tone; for be|tween
water and calcarious earth in its natural
&s;tate, there appears no elective attraction: water
poured on &s;hell-marl comes off pure, carrying no|thing
along with it. Nor do clay or &s;tone marl
differ, even when reduced into powder.</P>
<P>Vegetation is more promoted by weak lime-water
than by pure water. Two beans every way
equal were &s;et in pots filled with earth from the
&s;ame heap: the one was moi&s;tened with lime-water,
the other with pure water: the fir&s;t was
by far the quicke&s;t grower, and the mo&s;t vigo|rous.
Hence one benefit of quicklime: it con|verts
rain into lime-water, which is a great fer|tilizer.
This effect however is but temporary, as
will thus appear. Quicklime is lime&s;tone deprived
of its air, by the force of fire: but quicklime ex|po&s;ed
to the air, attracts air; and in time be|comes
again lime&s;tone as originally; con&s;equent|ly
unfit to make lime-water<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Edinburgh E&s;&s;ays phy&s;ical and literary, vol. 2. art. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Quicklime may have an effect on land as well as
on plants. It is highly probable, that it opens
clay-&s;oil to admit water that formerly re&s;ted on the
&s;urface. How otherwi&s;e can it be explained,
that liming renders clay-&s;oil drier? May it not
<PB N="353" REF="379">
al&s;o have the effect to increa&s;e the retentive power
of a loo&s;e &s;oil? This &s;eems probable, if what
Young the itinerant farmer &s;ays hold true, that
lime has a much greater effect upon loo&s;e moor
than upon any other &s;oil.</P>
<P>Salt is powerful; and an overdoze of it does
more mi&s;chief than of any other manure. It is
&s;oluble in water, and by that means enters the
mouths of plants. Its effect then mu&s;t be the
&s;ame with that of lime-water; and con&s;idering
how &s;paringly it ought to be laid on land, it is
not obvious what other effect it can have.</P>
<P>As nothing can enter the mouths of plants but
what is di&s;&s;olved in air or water, calcarious earth
in its natural &s;tate cannot enter. Yet &s;hell-marl,
clay-marl, &s;tone-marl, compo&s;ed mo&s;tly of calca|rious
earth, contribute undoubtedly to fertility.
If the&s;e manures cannot furni&s;h nouri&s;hment to
plants directly, they mu&s;t produce that effect in|directly,
by fitting a &s;oil to retain moi&s;ture, or by
preventing moi&s;ture from acting as a cement, or
by both. They certainly have the effect to keep
land from hardening: they render clay loo&s;e and
ductile, and prevent its being hardened by wa|ter.
Whether they increa&s;e the power of any
&s;oil to retain water, is left to experiment.</P>
<P>An overdo&s;e of &s;hell-marl, laid perhaps an inch
and an half or two inches thick, produces for a
time large crops. But at la&s;t it renders the &s;oil a
<HI>caput mortuum,</HI> capable neither of corn nor
<PB N="354" REF="380">
gra&s;s; of which there are too many in&s;tances in
Scotland: the &s;ame probably would follow, from
an overdo&s;e of clay-marl, &s;tone-marl, or pounded
lime&s;tone. How is this to be accounted for? Of
one thing we are certain, that by &s;uch overdo&s;e,
light &s;oil is rendered &s;o loo&s;e, as to be moved by
the wind; and that even clay-&s;oil is rendered &s;o
&s;oft, as to receive the impre&s;&s;ion of the lighte&s;t foot
at every &s;tep. Is it not then probable, that the
&s;oil is rendered &s;o open, as to retain little or no
water? But then, how comes the land to bear
any crop at all? I am reduced to another con|jecture,
that ordinary ploughing once a-year, is
not &s;ufficient to mix with the &s;oil &s;uch a quantity of
manure; and that an intimate mixture requires
&s;everal years. Even a moderate do&s;e of lime re|quires
more than a year by &s;uch management for
an intimate mixture; for which rea&s;on, the &s;e|cond
crop after lime is always better than the
fir&s;t, and the third frequently better than the &s;e|cond.
Now as the &s;oil is opened by that part
only which is mixed with it, the cropping may go
on &s;everal years, before &s;uch a quantity of the o|verdo&s;e,
is mixed as to occa&s;ion a total &s;terility.
This conjecture may be brought under the touch|&s;tone
of an experiment. Before or after harve&s;t,
let an overdo&s;e of &s;hell-marl be intimately mixed
with the &s;oil by reiterated ploughings and harrow|ings.
If the barley &s;own next &s;ea&s;on fail by lack
<PB N="355" REF="381">
of moi&s;ture, the conjecture will be converted into
a certainty.</P>
<P>Quicklime is of a nature very different from
calcarious earth in its natural &s;tate: by the latter,
land is rendered &s;o loo&s;e by an overdo&s;e as to hold
no water: by an overdo&s;e of the former, it is
hardened to &s;uch a degree as to be impervious to
water or to the roots of plants. Several &s;pots in
the Car&s;e of Gowry, are thus rendered &s;o hard
as to be unfit for vegetation.</P>
<P>The quantity of calcarious earth in clay-marl,
is frequently a half, and &s;ometimes more. Five
hundred cart-loads of clay-marl laid on an acre,
are found not to be an overdo&s;e. Suppo&s;ing the
half to be calcarious earth, and reckoning a cart
to hold &s;ix bolls; here are fifteen hundred bolls
of calcarious earth laid on an acre. Yet a far le&s;s
quantity of &s;hell-marl has been known to render the
&s;oil a <HI>caput mortuum;</HI> though there is not di&s;co|vered
any chymical difference, between the cal|carious
earth in clay-marl and that in &s;hell-marl:
they both equally are converted into lime by the
force of fire. Ignorance of nature, betrays us
at every turn to doubts and difficulties. May it
not be conjectured, that calcarious earth, by en|tering
into the compo&s;ition of an animal body,
becomes a more powerful manure than when
mixed with earth? There is an argument from
analogy to &s;upport that conjecture. Calcarious
earth changes its nature by the action of fire;
<PB N="356" REF="382">
and why may it not &s;uffer &s;ome change by being
made part of an animal body?</P>
<P>Every particular in the pre&s;ent chapter, whe|ther
relative to the plough or to manure, is per|fectly
agreeable to the general propo&s;ition, that
air and water with what is di&s;&s;olved in them, make
the nouri&s;hment of plants. To cultivate land in
&s;uch a manner as to retain a proper quantity of
air and water, is in all probability the chief or on|ly
means for making it fertile. In that view, I
have all along warmly recommended pulveriza|tion;
becau&s;e the more a &s;oil is pulverized, the
more water it will hold, and the more retentive
it will be of it. No mode of hu&s;bandry tends
more to pulverization than hor&s;e-hoeing; nor any
in&s;truments more than the brake and the harrows
above de&s;cribed. Soils are very different with re|&s;pect
to their power of attracting and retaining
air and water. Let the diligent farmer make ac|curate
experiments for a&s;certaining that difference,
and for increa&s;ing that power: no inquiries
tend more to the improvement of agriculture.
Our attempts to make a &s;oil perpetually fertile,
will probably fail; but our hopes of approaching
it, may be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the contents of this Part in ge|neral,
I have to ob&s;erve, that in natural philo|&s;ophy,
of which the &s;cience of agriculture is a
branch, que&s;tions occur of two kinds. Fir&s;t,
will a certain event happen in given circum|&s;tances?
<PB N="357" REF="383">
Second, &s;uppo&s;ing the event, what
is the cau&s;e? To que&s;tions of the fir&s;t kind,
the an&s;wer is <HI>fiat experimentum.</HI> All that can
be done with re&s;pect to the other kind, is from
a number of analogous facts, to form a gene|ral
rule or law of nature. Such rules at the
&s;ame time ought to be admitted with caution,
even after the coole&s;t induction. But tho&s;e who
are ardent for knowledge, cannot ea&s;ily &s;ub|mit
to the &s;low progre&s;s of philo&s;ophy: they are
always in a hurry to draw conclu&s;ions, and hurry
commonly leads them into error. Lord Bacon
fancifully compares knowledge to a ladder. Up|on
the fir&s;t &s;tep particular truths are di&s;covered
by ob&s;ervation or experiment. The next &s;tep is
to collect the&s;e into more general truths; from
which the a&s;cent is to what are &s;till more general.
There are many &s;teps to be taken before we ar|rive
at the top; that is, at the mo&s;t general
truths. But impatience makes us endeavour to
leap at once from the lowe&s;t &s;tep to the highe&s;t:
we tumble down, and find with regret that the
work mu&s;t begin anew.</P>
<P>To conclude. Here is my theory of agricul|ture,
di&s;played at full length; which is freely &s;ub|mitted
to the public, again&s;t who&s;e judgement
there lies no appeal. But let it be kept in view,
that it is &s;ubmitted as probable only, not as cer|tain.
It would require the life of an antedelu|vian,
to make all the experiments that are nece&s;|&s;ary,
<PB N="358" REF="384">
for piercing to the foundation, and for re|&s;olving
all into clear principles. My life at any
rate is too far advanced, for an undertaking &s;o
exten&s;ive. I found an impul&s;e to expo&s;e this
theory, naked as it is; and I gave way to the
impul&s;e, becau&s;e I flatter my&s;elf, that it may af|ford
&s;ome light in tracing the operations of nature.
One advantage it has above &s;everal other theo|ries,
that it can be &s;ubjected to the touch&s;tone of
experiments, many of which are &s;ugge&s;ted above.
By &s;uch experiments, &s;agaciou&s;ly conducted, it
mu&s;t &s;tand or fall.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">IMPERFECTION OF SCOTCH HUS|BANDRY.</HEAD>
<P>A Man can never have thorough confidence in
his road, till he be made acquainted with
the by paths that mi&s;lead him; and to be made
acquainted with the errors of our neighbours, is
the high way to good hu&s;bandry. My pre&s;ent
purpo&s;e, is to delineate the imperfect &s;tate of
Scotch hu&s;bandry, not only as formerly practi&s;ed
every where, but as practi&s;ed at pre&s;ent in mo&s;t
places. To contemplate the low &s;tate of their
country in the mo&s;t important of all arts, cannot
fail to excite ambition to excel in the few who are
&s;kilful, and to rou&s;e imitation in others.</P>
<P>Our crops in general are very indifferent; and
how can it be otherwi&s;e, con&s;idering our in&s;tru|ments
of hu&s;bandry, which are &s;adly imperfect?
What can be expected from them in a poor &s;oil,
when they perform &s;o little even in the riche&s;t?
Our crops accordingly corre&s;pond to our in&s;tru|ments.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="386">
From many examples it is made evident, that
our &s;oil and climate are capable of producing
draught hor&s;es, patient of labour, and &s;ingularly
hardy. Yet the breed is &s;o much neglected, that
they are commonly mi&s;erable creatures, without
&s;trength or mettle. Did landlords attend to their
intere&s;t, they would be diligent to improve the
breed. Why do they not reflect, that the &s;ame
farm-&s;ervants with better hor&s;es, would double
the ordinary work? By improving the breed,
they would draw more rent from their tenants,
without laying any additional burden upon them.
With re&s;pect to oxen, there is no care taken either
in the breeding or feeding. How ea&s;y is it for a
gentleman to procure a good bull for his tenants?
and from the little care of providing food for
draught oxen, one would &s;u&s;pect it to be a gene|ral
opinion, that they require no food. In &s;um|mer
they are turned out into bare pa&s;ture, &s;carce
&s;ufficient for &s;heep. In winter, a &s;mall bottle of
&s;traw, not above a &s;tone weight, is all that is al|lowed
them in the twenty-four hours; which af|ter
the turn of the year, being dry and &s;aple&s;s,
affords very little nouri&s;hment. What can ani|mals
&s;o &s;ed do in a plough? And yet &s;uch is the
&s;tupidity of many farmers, that in&s;tead of adding
to the food, they add to the number; as if it
would mend the matter, to add cattle that can
&s;carce &s;upport their own weight. One unaccu|&s;tomed
to &s;ee ten oxen in a plough led on by two
<PB N="361" REF="387">
hor&s;es, cannot avoid &s;miling. With his goad the
driver beats the hor&s;es, and pricks every ox as he
advances. He then runs forward twenty yards to
beat the hor&s;es a &s;econd time and prick the oxen.
Some of the oxen in the mean time, in&s;tead of
drawing, are found hanging on the yoke, and
keeping others back. It is indeed next to im|practicable,
to make ten weak oxen in a plough,
draw all at the &s;ame time. Nor is this the only
inconvenience. A great number of oxen by &s;uch
management, is requi&s;ite for &s;tocking a farm;
which is not always within the reach of the mo&s;t
indu&s;trious. In a year of &s;carcity be&s;ide, the
bea&s;ts are actually &s;tarved. And what is wor&s;t of
all, the tenant, in order to get &s;traw for his cat|tle,
is commonly nece&s;&s;itated to thre&s;h out his
corn, without waiting for a market, or having a
granery for it.</P>
<P>Our farmers, led entirely by cu&s;tom, not by
reflection, &s;eldom think of proportioning the num|ber
of their working cattle, to the u&s;es they have
for them. Hence, in different counties, from &s;ix
to twelve oxen in a plough, without any regard
to the &s;oil. Seldom it is, that more than $our
good bea&s;ts can be nece&s;&s;ary, if the proper time
for ploughing be watched.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ion of a farm into infield and outfield,
is execrable hu&s;bandry. Formerly, war employed
the bulk of our people: the remainder were far
from &s;ufficiently numerous for cultivating even
<PB N="362" REF="388">
that &s;mall proportion of our land which is capable
of the plough. Hence exten&s;ive farms, a &s;mall
part of which next the dwelling, termed <HI>in|field,</HI>
was cultivated for corn: the remainder,
termed <HI>outfield,</HI> was abandoned to the cattle, in
appearance for pa&s;ture, but in reality for &s;tarving.
The &s;ame mode continues to this day, without
many exceptions, though nece&s;&s;ity cannot be
pl$$ded for it. But cu&s;tom is the ruling princi|ple
$word$ governs all. Sad is the condition of the
labouring cattle; which are often reduced to
thi&s;tles, and withered &s;traw. A &s;ingle acre of
red clover would give more food than a whole out|field;
yet how common is the complaint of te|nants,
that they are di&s;abled from carrying on
any &s;ummer-work, for want of food to their
hor&s;es; a &s;hameful complaint, con&s;idering how
ea&s;y the remedy is.</P>
<P>Cu&s;tom is no where more prevalent than in the
form of ridges. No le&s;s high than broad, they
are enormous ma&s;&s;es of accumulated earth, that
admit not cro&s;s-ploughing, nor any ploughing
but gathering and cleaving. Cu&s;tom and imita|tion
are &s;o powerful, as that our ridges are no
le&s;s high in the &s;teepe&s;t bank, than in the flatte&s;t
field. Balks between ridges are equally frequent,
though invincible ob&s;tructions to good culture.
It would puzzle one at fir&s;t view to explain, why
&s;uch &s;trips of land are left untilled. They mu&s;t
have been re&s;erved originally, as a receptacle for
<PB N="363" REF="389">
&s;tones, thrown oft the tilled land; and hu&s;band|men
were led by imitation to leave &s;uch &s;trips,
even where there were few or no &s;tones.</P>
<P>The proper time for ploughing or harrowing, is
when the &s;oil upon &s;tirring moulders into &s;mall
parts. This is not ob&s;erved by farmers, &s;o care|fully
as it ought to be. How common is it to &s;ee
even a clay &s;oil ploughed, when &s;oaked in water,
or when hard like a &s;tone. Little attention is gi|ven
to what may be termed <HI>the fro&s;t-prepara|tion;</HI>
which is, to open the ground before win|ter,
in order that fro&s;t may pierce deep and mel|low
the &s;oil.</P>
<P>Shallow ploughing is univer&s;al, without the lea&s;t
regard to deepne&s;s of &s;oil. The temperance of
our people may be a proper &s;ubject for ironical
prai&s;e; for though nature affords commonly ten or
twelve inches of &s;oil, they are humbly &s;atisfied
with a half or third.</P>
<P>Ribbing is a general practice, though the &s;light|e&s;t
reflection is &s;ufficient to make it evident, that
to leave half of the land untilled, mu&s;t be wretch|ed
hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P>Summer-fallow has of late years crept in, and
is now common in three or four counties. In
the re&s;t of Scotland, for want of &s;ummer-fallow,
there is a continual &s;truggle for &s;uperiority, be|tween
corn and weeds. Do not &s;uch provoking
farmers &s;ee, that it is fruitle&s;s to manure land o|ver-run
with weeds? Do they not ob&s;erve, that
<PB N="364" REF="390">
the manure they be&s;tow encourages weeds as
much as corn; or rather, that it envigorates the
weeds to de&s;troy the corn? Make a progre&s;s
through Scotland, you &s;ee &s;tubborn weeds in e|very
corner &s;cattering their feed, and fouling the
ground more and more. It is an ea&s;y work to
cut down weeds before they go to &s;eed. Would
not one think, that work &s;o ea&s;y would never
be neglected? and yet it is never done. A
Scotch farmer behaves wor&s;e than E&s;au: the lat|ter
got a me&s;s of pottage for his birthright; the
former &s;urrenders his to weeds, without any re|compen&s;e.</P>
<P>There is &s;carce &s;uch a thing practi&s;ed, as to
harrow before &s;owing. The &s;eed is thrown into
rough uneven ground, and the half is buried.</P>
<P>The roller is a mo&s;t u&s;eful in&s;trument. It was
unknown till lately; and even at pre&s;ent is very
little u&s;ed.</P>
<P>With regard to rotation of crops, a mo&s;t im|portant
article, there is great ignorance among
our farmers. As it would be tedious to enter in|to
particulars, I refer to ch. 7. where that &s;ub|ject
is treated of.</P>
<P>Our farmers &s;how very little &s;kill in harve&s;t-work.
I confine my&s;elf to a &s;ingle in&s;tance. The
&s;heaves are bound up with a rope, compo&s;ed of
two lengths of the corn, twi&s;ted together; which
makes the &s;heaves commonly of a mon&s;trous &s;ize.
The binder, pre&s;&s;ing hard with his knee, binds
<PB N="365" REF="391">
the &s;heaf &s;o clo&s;e, as with difficulty to admit his
finger. The weather mu&s;t be extremely favour|able,
if it be &s;ufficiently dry in a fortnight, to be
ventured in a &s;tack; it commonly mu&s;t &s;tand in
the field three weeks. Let any one con&s;ider the
ri&s;k of the crop in brittle weather, &s;uch as hap|pens
ordinarily in autumn. Nor is this all. Such
&s;heaves are not only unhandy, but are apt to break
loo&s;e in carrying to the &s;tack, or from the &s;tack
to the barn. A &s;heaf &s;hould never exceed what
can be &s;lightly bound together with a &s;ingle
length of the corn: it is &s;itter to be &s;tacked in a
week, than ordinary &s;heaves in three.</P>
<P>No branch of hu&s;bandry is le&s;s under&s;tood,
than manure. A dunghill is a very improper bed
for corn: lime and marl are &s;till more improper;
for nothing will grow on them. Hence it is ap|parent,
that the intimate mixture of manure with
the &s;oil, is the great circum&s;tance for vegetation.
In order to that end, the &s;oil ought to be highly
pulverized, and the manure divided into its &s;mall|e&s;t
parts. With re&s;pect to dung in particular, it
ought to be carefully mixed in the dunghill, not
neglecting to divide by the hand any lumps that
may be in it. Let our farmers &s;ay, whether they
are &s;o accurate. Nothing more ordinary, than
heaps of dung withering in the $ield, incapable
to be intimately mixed with any &s;oil. Nothing
more ordinary, than dung laid on the dunghill in
<PB N="366" REF="392">
barrowfuls, without being &s;pread or mixed with
what was there before.</P>
<P>A potato is a mo&s;t u&s;eful plant, and, when
properly cultivated, affords a plentiful crop. It
is a great re&s;ource to the labouring poor, being
a nouri&s;hing food that requires very little cook|ing.
We have been afflicted of late years
with very bad &s;ea&s;ons, which, but for that re|&s;ource,
mu&s;t have driven many of our people
from their native country. Yet potatoes to this
day continue to be propagated in lazy-beds. Ex|pert
farmers, not many in number, rai&s;e them
with the plough at the twentieth part of the ex|pence.
This method has be&s;ide two other ad|vantages:
it leaves the &s;oil in the be&s;t &s;tate for
&s;ub&s;equent crops; and the potatoes are more pa|latable
than what are rai&s;ed in a lazy-bed.</P>
<P>Swine make a profitable article of hu&s;bandry,
very little attended to in Scotland. They are fed
at a &s;mall expence, and yet make mo&s;t nouri&s;h|ing
food. Every per&s;on who has a cow, ought
al&s;o to have a pig. This is univer&s;al in England:
it is creeping into Berwick&s;hire, but in few other
places as far as I know.</P>
<P>Very few farms in Scotland are ju&s;tly propor|tioned:
&s;ome are too &s;mall; the bulk of them too
large. The former lead to a habit of idlene&s;s;
the latter into a habit of &s;lovenline&s;s, by want of
power to do ju&s;tice to every part. There is not
an article in hu&s;bandry more e&s;&s;ential, than to
<PB N="367" REF="393">
adju&s;t a farm to the &s;kill and ability of the te|nant.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A BOARD FOR IMPROVING AGRICULTURE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a maxim in politics, that every country
will be populous in proportion to the fertility
of its &s;oil; upon which account, agriculture is the
mo&s;t u&s;eful of all arts. And yet it is a &s;ad truth,
that in Scotland, that art has not advanced far
beyond the fir&s;t &s;tage of its progre&s;s. In England
indeed, it has made a much greater progre&s;s;
and yet far inferior in perfection to Engli&s;h ma|nufactures
and commerce. Agriculture is car|ried
on every where without a &s;chool; and for
that rea&s;on, it is commonly thought to require no
&s;chooling. Can a Briti&s;h mini&s;ter embrace any
mea&s;ure more patriotic, than to encourage agri|culture
and its profe&s;&s;ors? No other mea&s;ure
would &s;o effectually aggrandize Britain. A &s;mall
&s;hare of the money and attention be&s;towed on
rai&s;ing colonies in America, would have done
wonders at home. And yet, mark the &s;triking
difference: our arts are our own, which we ne|ver
can be deprived of while indu&s;try remains:
in the very con&s;titution of our colonies, on the
contrary, there are cau&s;es of &s;eparation, that grow
<PB N="368" REF="394">
daily &s;tronger and &s;tronger; a wide-extended
country, a fertile &s;oil, navigable rivers, and a
growing population. I di&s;regard the pre&s;ent re|bellion
of our Americans: for they will &s;oon be
reduced to obedience. But as they derive from
Britain high notions of liberty and independence,
and as they are daily growing into power and o|pulence,
the aera of their total &s;eparation, cannot
be at a great di&s;tance: it is indeed ab&s;urd to
think, that a great nation, in the vigour of pro|&s;perity
and patrioti&s;m, can be kept in &s;ubjection
by a nation not more powerful, enervated by lu|xury
and avarice. Let us not however de&s;pond;
for if agriculture be carried on but to the perfec|tion
that our &s;oil and climate will readily admit,
it will amply compen&s;ate the lo&s;s of the&s;e colo|nies.</P>
<P>Books are u&s;eful for advancing hu&s;bandry, o|therwi&s;e
this little treati&s;e &s;hould not have &s;een
the light. But books are far inferior to living in|&s;tructors,
who convey knowledge by practice as
well as precept. We have a board for manufac|tures
and fi&s;heries; a wi&s;e in&s;titution which has
done much good. Why not al&s;o a board for a|griculture?
Is agriculture a le&s;s u&s;eful art than
tho&s;e mentioned? or does it le&s;s require in&s;truc|tion?
Hartlib, in his legacy, laments, that no
public director of hu&s;bandry had ever been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
in England. The pre&s;ent time is in Scot|land
the happie&s;t for &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hment. Be|fore
<PB N="369" REF="395">
the union of the two kingdoms, our people
were &s;o benummed with oppre&s;&s;ion, that the mo&s;t
able director would have made no impre&s;&s;ion.
Freedom has braced their nerves, and has made
them take heart to be indu&s;trious. They li&s;ten to
in&s;truction: let them perceive their intere&s;t, and
they will chearfully practi&s;e what they are taught.
A board for agriculture, would among us have
wonderful &s;ucce&s;s in many important articles.
Con&s;idering the quantity of wa&s;te land even in
our be&s;t-cultivated counties, it is not too &s;anguine
to hope, that our corn-crops might be doubled.
What a ble&s;&s;ing would this be to Scotland, which
for many years has been reduced to import
great quantities? Our hor&s;es and horned cat|tle,
are far inferior to what may be produced
by good management. Our &s;heep weigh not a|bove
ten pounds a quarter, nor their wool above
two pounds. The &s;oil by good culture would
feed &s;heep to the weight of twenty-four pounds a
quarter; carrying from &s;ix to ten pounds of wool,
which would be a valuable acqui&s;ition to the
woollen manufacture. Lambs, in &s;everal in&s;tances,
have been advanced to twelve &s;hillings a-head,
and wedders to forty &s;hillings. The&s;e are but a
&s;pecimen of the various improvements that might
be perfected by &s;uch a board.</P>
<P>The plan I have in view, is &s;imple. Let the
board con&s;i&s;t of nine members, the mo&s;t noted
for &s;kill in hu&s;bandry, and for patrioti&s;m. As I
<PB N="370" REF="396">
propo&s;e no reward to the&s;e gentlemen, but the
honour of &s;erving their country, the choice will
not be difficult: in lucrative employments, per&s;o|nal
connections have much greater influence than
per&s;onal merit; and it is avarice only that &s;ets peo|ple
at variance. Where per&s;onal merit is the &s;ole
object of choice, there is &s;eldom much difference
in opinion. To ea&s;e the board in the laborious
branch of their bu&s;ine&s;s, they ought to be pro|vided
with an able &s;ecretary, to minute their pro|ceedings,
to write their di&s;patches, and to carry
on their corre&s;pondence, foreign and dome&s;tic.
As punctual attendance is nece&s;&s;ary, the good be|haviour
of &s;uch an officer may well intitle him to
a &s;alary of L. 100 yearly; with the addition of
L. 30 more in a year of extraordinary bu&s;ine&s;s, at
the di&s;cretion of the board; but not unle&s;s all the
members be unanimous. A larger &s;alary would
be an object of intere&s;t, and &s;oon degenerate into
a &s;inecure.</P>
<P>A regular meeting once a month, may be &s;uf|ficient;
with liberty to tho&s;e who have mo&s;t lei|&s;ure,
to meet at intervals for expediting what
may require di&s;patch. It would cramp the pro|ceedings
of &s;uch a board, to confine it to a quo|rum.
As there cannot be any &s;elf-intere&s;t to create
a bias, tho&s;e who meet ought to have the power
of the whole; and what they tran&s;act ought to be
final, if not altered by a greater number the next
monthly meeting.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="397">
The things nece&s;&s;ary to be undertaken by this
board, at the commencement of their operations,
will require much labour and &s;agacity. The fir&s;t
is, to make out a &s;tate of the hu&s;bandry prac|ti&s;ed
in the different counties; in which notice
mu&s;t be taken of the climate, of the &s;oil, of the
mode of cropping, and of the in&s;truments of hu&s;|bandry,
noting the prices of all the particulars
that enter into farming. The next is a paper of
in&s;tructions for improving hu&s;bandry, &s;uited to
the &s;oil and &s;ituation of every di&s;trict; with &s;pe|cial
reference to the pre&s;ent practice, &s;howing
where it is defective or erroneous, and propo&s;ing
the cheape&s;t and mo&s;t effectual corrections.
The&s;e preliminaries being &s;ettled, the ordinary
bu&s;ine&s;s of the board, may be carried on ea&s;ily
and comfortably. In the fir&s;t place, there is a
nece&s;&s;ity for an in&s;pector, named by the board,
to make a progre&s;s from time to time in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
places, for reporting the progre&s;s of the improve|ments
directed, and for giving in&s;truction in ca&s;es
that cannot &s;o clearly be put in writing. In this
progre&s;s, &s;pecial notice ought to be taken of the
be&s;t-conducted farms, whether by landlords or
tenants. A few &s;ilver medals be&s;towed on the
mo&s;t de&s;erving, will rou&s;e emulation in all, and
promote indu&s;try. Second, this board will con|&s;ider
it as a capital branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, to an&s;wer
queries, and to &s;olicit a corre&s;pondence with men
of &s;kill. Third, they ought carefully to inform
<PB N="372" REF="398">
them&s;elves of every invention that tends to im|prove
the art, and to publi&s;h what they think u&s;e|ful.
Fourth, premiums ought to be propo&s;ed,
and di&s;tributed among tho&s;e who profit the mo&s;t
by the in&s;tructions of the board. The&s;e premi|ums
ought to be ploughs, harrows, carts, con|&s;tructed
after the be&s;t models; which be&s;ide ex|citing
indu&s;try, would be a means to introduce
the be&s;t hu&s;bandry-in&s;truments. Fifth, in no o|ther
re&s;pect would a board of agriculture be &s;o
u&s;eful, as in directing proper experiments. A|griculture,
though the prime of arts, is far from
perfection in any country. This in part is ow|ing
to its complex nature; but chiefly, to the
length of time that is nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;certain, by a
cour&s;e of experiments, any capital point in theory
or practice. The life of man is too &s;hort for &s;uch
an undertaking. The only remedy is to employ
many hands upon different experiments; which
cannot be done effectually, but under the direction
of a board that never dies. Let li&s;ts be made
from time to time, of the points that are capable
to be a&s;certained by experiments: let proper ex|periments
be &s;ugge&s;ted: let the&s;e experiments be
di&s;tributed among per&s;ons of &s;kill. And when
their &s;ucce&s;s is reported, the conclu&s;ions that
may be drawn from them, ought to be pu|bli&s;hed.
This would be the mo&s;t effectual me|thod
that ever has been contrived, to ripen know|ledge
in hu&s;bandry. To enliven this branch of
<PB N="373" REF="399">
bu&s;ine&s;s, premiums ought to be propo&s;ed, lucra|tive
as well as honorary.</P>
<P>To make the board proceed with &s;pirit, a book
or pamphlet ought to be publi&s;hed annually, con|taining
the tran&s;actions of the board, during the
preceding year. The profit of the work, is a
perqui&s;ite to the &s;ecretary; which will encourage
him to be&s;tow his utmo&s;t &s;kill in the compilation.</P>
<P>To procure public favour, men of character
and knowledge may be introduced by the mem|bers
at their monthly meetings, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in their
deliberations.</P>
<P>The choice of proper members, is the capital
point: the whole depends on it. The choice is
the more difficult, as it mu&s;t be confined to gen|tlemen
who re&s;ide in Edinburgh, &s;ome part of
the year; becau&s;e from others, punctual attend|ance
cannot be expected. It would be un&s;afe to
leave the choice to members of parliament; who,
even again&s;t their private &s;entiments, are obliged
to &s;olicit for their friends and voters, without re|gard
to merit. The choice mu&s;t not be left ab|&s;olutely
to the chief mini&s;ter; who, at &s;uch a di|&s;tance,
is &s;eldom per&s;onally acquainted with the
be&s;t qualified. The &s;afe&s;t method I can think of
is, that the ju&s;tices of peace of each corn-county,
&s;hould at a quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions name one. Out of
the&s;e, the mini&s;ter chu&s;es the nine members.</P>
<P>The choice of a member to &s;upply a vacancy,
is a matter no le&s;s delicate. A &s;ociety of gentle|men,
<PB N="374" REF="400">
who &s;erve for honour not for profit, appear
well intitled to chu&s;e their companion. But to a|void
faction, which would be ruinous in &s;uch a
&s;ociety, the choice ought to be unanimous. The
di&s;&s;ent of a &s;ingle member, need not be regarded;
but if two di&s;&s;ent, the choice mu&s;t be in the
crown. If a member be ab&s;ent three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
monthly meetings, without an excu&s;e approved
by the board, he is to be held as having de&s;erted
his office, to make way for the election of a new
member.</P>
<P>The election of a &s;ecretary is a point &s;till more
delicate. The board ought naturally to have the
choice of their own &s;ecretary; but in ca&s;e of a di|vi&s;ion,
the di&s;&s;ent of three from the other &s;ix,
&s;hall transfer the election to the crown.</P>
<P>The royal &s;ociety in London, is perhaps the on|ly
&s;ociety in the world, that has flouri&s;hed &s;o long,
with no other motive but thir&s;t for knowledge.
The members have now an additional motive,
which is the reputation of being enli&s;ted in a &s;o|ciety,
&s;o illu&s;trious. In the pre&s;ent low &s;tate of
patrioti&s;m, affection to ones country is not alone
&s;ufficient, to pre&s;erve long in vigour a board of
agriculture. Luckily, there is an additional mo|tive,
inherent in the very nature of the in&s;titu|tion.
Money is nece&s;&s;ary to carry on the opera|tions
of the &s;ociety; and the di&s;tribution of that
money among per&s;ons of merit, will be a con|&s;tant
entertainment to the members. A great
<PB N="375" REF="401">
&s;um would be a temptation to mi&s;apply it. There|fore,
no more ought to be put into their power,
than what is barely &s;ufficient to carry on the ma|nagement
with &s;ucce&s;s. Be&s;ide the &s;ecretary's &s;a|lary,
L. 500 yearly di&s;creetly di&s;tributed may be
&s;ufficient. And I boldly affirm, that &s;uch a &s;um
cannot be laid out with more advantage, whether
the public be regarded, or the good of a valuable
portion of our people.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the tru&s;tees for ma|nufactures,
will afford good accommodation to
both &s;ocieties; and &s;everal of the acting tru&s;tees,
are qualified to make a figure in both.</P>
<P>Zeal for the pro&s;perity of Britain, makes me
ardently wi&s;h to have this plan extended to Eng|land.
The Engli&s;h enjoy the reputation of being
excellent farmers; and &s;o they are, compared
with their neighbours in France, Italy, and Spain.
They are however far, very far, from the perfec|tion
of the art. A board for agriculture is indeed
le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary in England, than in Scotland;
but that England would be greatly profited by
&s;uch an in&s;titution, will be acknowledged by every
one who is acquainted with Engli&s;h agriculture.
I appeal to Mr Young for the following facts, ex|tracted
from his different tours; which, at the
&s;ame time, are but a &s;pecimen of much wrong
practice mentioned by him.</P>
<P>Seldom is a plough &s;een in England with fewer
than four hor&s;es, nor is it always confined to that
<PB N="376" REF="402">
number; and yet, &s;eldom are more than two
hor&s;es nece&s;&s;ary, if the plough be well con&s;truct|ed.
A great &s;um is thus expended upon &s;uper|fluous
hor&s;es, which wounds the public by unne|ce&s;&s;ary
con&s;umption, is hurtful to landlords by
le&s;&s;ening their rent, and retards the progre&s;s of
hu&s;bandry. Among numberle&s;s in&s;tances, I men|tion
the I&s;le of Thanet, where the &s;oil is a light
loam on a chalky bottom; and yet with four
hor&s;es in each plough, they &s;eldom pierce deeper
than three inches, which is &s;cratching in&s;tead of
ploughing.</P>
<P>The number of draught-cattle is &s;eldom pro|portioned,
with any accuracy, to the extent of
the farm. Frequently, no fewer than eight
hor&s;es and as many oxen, are employed in a farm
of a hundred acres. With &s;uch an expence, the
land mu&s;t be fertile indeed, if it afford any rent
to the landlord. In &s;ome farms not exeeding fifty
acres, &s;ix hor&s;es are kept. The u&s;ing oxen in|&s;tead
of hor&s;es, and employing no more of them
than nece&s;&s;ary, would be a &s;aving to England of
&s;everal millions yearly. Were that improvement
accompanied with a proper regulation for the
poor, England would be in a higher &s;tate of pro|&s;perity,
than is enjoyed by any other nation.</P>
<P>A &s;kilful rotation of crops, is far from being
common. In&s;tances are frequent in every part of
England of the following rotations, fallow, wheat,
oats, wheat. Al&s;o, fallow, wheat, oats, oats.
<PB N="377" REF="403">
Al&s;o, fallow, wheat, oats, barley. Al&s;o, barley,
oats, oats. Al&s;o, turnip, barley, oats, oats. E|ven
the be&s;t &s;oils mu&s;t be exhau&s;ted in time, by
&s;uch oppre&s;&s;ive cropping.</P>
<P>The great advantages of hor&s;e-hoeing, are a
crop, and at the &s;ame time a &s;ub&s;tantial fallow.
And yet, hor&s;e-hoeing, though invented in Eng|land,
is not practi&s;ed there. Many farmers do
not even hand-hoe their turnip-crop; and many
neglect to hand-hoe their bean-crop, after being
&s;own in drills.</P>
<P>The proper management of artificial gra&s;&s;es, is
far from being common. Of all gra&s;&s;es, red clo|ver
is the mo&s;t beneficial; and yet there are farm|ers,
not a few in number, who bani&s;h red clover,
as hurtful by fo&s;tering weeds. It has indeed that
effect, if allowed to grow three or four years;
but why not change it every year? It is not un|frequent
to &s;ee a field left to be covered with na|tural
gra&s;s. By this &s;lovenly practice, the crops
are not only &s;canty, but of a bad kind. In Der|by&s;hire
particularly, a field, after three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
crops of oats, is abandoned to nature. Wor&s;e
hu&s;bandry is not to be met with, among the mo&s;t
ignorant farmers in Scotland.</P>
<P>Draining indeed is common, but conducted with
little &s;kill. There is no &s;uch thing known in Eng|land
as drains at the &s;urface made with the
plough; though &s;uch drains po&s;&s;e&s;s the advantages
of being cheap, effectual, and perpetual.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="404">
The foregoing errors-and imperfections, with
an endle&s;s number more, would be remedied by
a Board, eminent for patrioti&s;m, and for &s;kill in
agriculture; and farmers would fairly be direct|ed
to the road that leads to the perfection of their
art. Population and indu&s;try would be the con|&s;equences,
with a great increa&s;e of the public re|venue.
England would become &s;o pro&s;perous
and powerful, as to &s;uffer little di&s;tre&s;s from the
lo&s;s of its American colonies, &s;hould that ungrate|ful
people &s;ucceed ultimately in a total defection.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">GENERAL HEADS OF A LEASE FOR A CORN-FARM.</HEAD>
<P>IN a lea&s;e of this kind, what chiefly ought to
be in view, is to re&s;train the tenant from
impoveri&s;hing the land, and yet leave him at li|berty
to improve it; re&s;embling a Briti&s;h mo|narch,
who has unbounded power to do good,
none to do mi&s;chief. In this variable climate,

<P>This ob&s;ervation is not intended to bani&s;h rules

of hu&s;bandry. All that can be done in an at|tempt
like the pre&s;ent, is to &s;ugge&s;t a few general
rules, for a landlord to chu&s;e upon in granting
lea&s;es. It is his bu&s;ine&s;s to judge which of the&s;e
rules will be&s;t fit his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t re&s;pects the time of endurance,
which, though an important article, is unnece&s;|&s;ary
to be enlarged on here. It is believed to be
now the univer&s;al opinion, that without a long
lea&s;e, it is vain to hope for an improving tenant&punc;
The mo&s;t approved time of endurance, as the like|lie&s;t
to prevent wa&s;te, is to $ix a time certain, &s;up|po&s;e
nineteen or two nineteen years; and to add
the li$e of the tenant who is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at the
expiry of the time certain. A man never lo&s;es
hope of living longer; and he will never run out
ground, that he hopes yet to be long in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of. By this means, the tenant is deluded in|to
a cour&s;e of management, equally pro$itable to
<PB N="380" REF="406">
him&s;elf and to his landlord. But what, if, after
liming or other expen&s;ive manure, the tenant
happen to die &s;uddenly before reaping any pro|fit?
With a view to that event, let there be a
clau&s;e in the lea&s;e, for paying to his repre&s;entatives
what &s;um the tenant's profit has fallen &s;hort of the
expence.</P>
<P>Second, A&s;&s;ignees and &s;ubtenants ought to be
excluded. For where a tenant has it in his power
to make his lea&s;e a &s;ubject of commerce, he will
be &s;paring in laying out money on improvements.</P>
<P>Third, Whether the rent ought to be paid in
corn or money, depends on circum&s;tances. Corn-rent
cramps the tenant in his management; for
it obliges him to &s;ow yearly corn of the &s;ame
kind with what he pays. Money-rent, on the
contrary, promotes good culture, in order to
produce the weightie&s;t grain, the benefit of which
accrues entirely to the tenant. There is an ad|ditional
rea&s;on for money-rent, that the tenant,
by prudence and patience, can draw a better
price for his corns at the home-market, than his
landlord can. The rent therefore ought to be
paid in money, unle&s;s where there is a &s;uperfluity
of corn for exportation; which can be managed
with more advantage by the landlord, who has all
his farm-victual to export, than by a tenant who
has but a &s;mall quantity.</P>
<P>Fourth, In this country, the profit of gra&s;s is
to this day not under&s;tood, but by a few. Corn
<PB N="381" REF="407">
is the object of the generality; and that wrong
bias ought to be rectified, by a clau&s;e confining
the tenant to a certain proportion of his ground
in corn, a third, for example, or a half. There
cannot be a general rule; becau&s;e it varies with
the nature of the &s;oil, and &s;till more with the op|portunity
of manure. But to give room for ex|traordinary
improvements, an addition to the
proportion of corn may be indulged, upon condi|tion
of paying &s;hillings additional rent for
every acre above the proportion originally agreed
on.</P>
<P>Fifth, A clau&s;e prohibiting white corn-crops to
be taken in immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, will be an ef|fectual
bar again&s;t improveri&s;hing the land. Pea&s;e,
beans, turnip, cabbage, and potatoes, are profit|able
crops; and red clover may be more profit|able
than any of them, by $eeding all the farm-cattle
upon it, which will &s;ave many acres of pa|&s;ture.
This and the foregoing rule, without any
other precaution, will in all events &s;uffice to keep
the ground in good heart.</P>
<P>Sixth, The following, or &s;ome &s;uch clau&s;e,
will excite a tenant's highe&s;t indu&s;try to improve
his farm to the utmo&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be only
for nineteen years. At expiry of the lea&s;e, the
tenant &s;hall be intitled to a &s;econd nineteen years,
upon paying a fifth part more of rent; unle&s;s the
landlord give him ten years purcha&s;e of that fifth
part. The rent, for example, is L. 100. The
<PB N="382" REF="408">
tenant offers L. 120. He is intitled to continue
his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a &s;econd nineteen years at the advan|ced
rent, unle&s;s the landlord pay him L. 200. If
he offer a &s;till higher rent, the landlord cannot
turn him out, unle&s;s he pay him ten years pur|cha&s;e
of that offer.</P>
<P>Seventh, As both landlord and tenant are con|cerned
in pre&s;erving the fences, both ought to
concur in the expence. Therefore, let the care
of the fences be tru&s;ted to the landlord's hedger;
and whatever work is be&s;towed on the tenant's
fences, &s;hall be paid to the hedger at &s;o much per
day. Where the pre&s;ervation of the fences is left
entirely to the tenant, he turns carele&s;s, and does
things by halves; where it is left entirely to the
landlord, the tenant takes no care to keep his cat|tle
from tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Eighth, In order to pre&s;erve to the landlord a
privilege to plant trees, which is commonly ne|glected
in lea&s;es, I propo&s;e that out of the lea&s;e
be excepted certain &s;pots, proper to be planted,
for &s;helter, for beauty, or as not being arable;
the landlord to inclo&s;e and plant, the tenant to
carry the &s;tones that are nece&s;&s;ary for enclo&s;ing.
To encourage him to pre&s;erve the trees, he is to
have the whole weedings for the purpo&s;es of his
farm. There may be&s;ide be added a clau&s;e, en|couraging
the tenant to plant trees, by permit|ting
him to cut them down for his own u&s;e. And
the landlord is to have his choice, either to pay
<PB N="383" REF="409">
for what are left at the tenant's removal, or to
allow him to di&s;po&s;e of them.</P>
<P>Ninth, In a tenant two things are required;
fir&s;t, &s;kill and indu&s;try for managing the farm;
and, next, money for &s;tocking it &s;ufficiently,
without which, &s;kill and indu&s;try avail not. With
re&s;pect to both, our common law errs gro&s;sly.
As to the fir&s;t, a farm can never be prudently
managed by a plurality; for there it holds, &s;o
many men &s;o many minds; and yet, by law heirs-portioners
&s;ucceed in a lea&s;e, as well as in other
heritable &s;ubjects. To remedy the common law
in lea&s;es that go to heirs, let it be provided,
that the elde&s;t heir-female &s;hall &s;ucceed without
divi&s;ion; or that the landlord &s;hall have it in his
power to chu&s;e any of the heirs-female he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the other, our common law is
altogether inju&s;tifiable, as it gives the whole &s;tock|ing
to the other children, leaving the bare lea&s;e
to the heir; without means to &s;tock the farm a|new,
unle&s;s other heritable funds be left be&s;ide
the lea&s;e, which &s;eldom is the ca&s;e. This is cruel|ly
unju&s;t, both to the heir and to the landlord.
The heir has not even the benefit of collation,
becau&s;e it would bring a plurality of conjunct le&s;&s;ees
upon the landlord. The heir therefore is in ef|fect
totally di&s;inherited; as a bare lea&s;e is of no
&s;ignificancy without money or credit. The in|ju&s;tice
with regard to the landlord is no le&s;s fla|grant,
who has thus a tenant impo&s;ed on him,
<PB N="384" REF="410">
from whom no rent can be expected. To pre|&s;erve
the lea&s;e and &s;tocking united, which mu&s;t
be done by paction &s;ince law is defective, let a
&s;um be &s;pecified in the lea&s;e, &s;uch as may be &s;uf|ficient
for &s;tocking the farm; which &s;um the heir
&s;hall be intitled to demand from his predece&s;&s;or's
repre&s;entatives, unle&s;s the farm be left to him
with a &s;tocking equivalent in value. And the
clau&s;e may be conceived in &s;ome manner like
what follows. &startq;And con&s;idering that if the &s;aid
A. B. die during the currency of this tack, his
whole moveables, not excepting the &s;tocking
of his farm, fall by law to his other children,
by which it may happen, that nothing is left to
the heir but the naked tack, without a &s;tock|ing
or money to purcha&s;e it; therefore, to
prevent this hard&s;hip, equally prejudicial to
the heir and to his landlord, it is expre&s;sly co|venanted,
notwith&s;tanding the time of endu|rance
above &s;pecified, That this tack &s;hall fall
and be extinct by the &s;aid A. B.'s death, un|le&s;s
he make good to his heir effects heritable
or moveable to the extent of Sterling,
the parties being &s;en&s;ible, that a &s;tocking pro|per
for this farm cannot be of value le&s;s than
the &s;aid &s;um.&endq;</P>
<P>Tenth, To render the removing of tenants at
the expiry of the lea&s;e more ea&s;y and certain than
it is by our law, and without expence to either
party, I propo&s;e the following article. Suppo&s;ing
<PB N="385" REF="411">
a lea&s;e for nineteen years to be agreed on at a
rent of L. 50, let one, two, or three years be
added, binding the tenant to pay an additional
rent for the&s;e years, a half more for example, or
double. But with a provi&s;o, that the tenant
&s;hall be at liberty to remove at the end of the
nineteen years, upon notifying to his landlord,
three months before, his intention to remove.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4">
<HEAD>ARTICLE IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PLANTS AND ANIMALS COMPARED.</HEAD>
<P>ANimals are provided with various powers
corre&s;ponding to their de&s;tination; &s;ome
for &s;upporting the animal frame, &s;ome for gra|tifying
de&s;ire. Plants, in all appearance, have
no feeling of plea&s;ure nor of pain; and con&s;e|quently
no de&s;ires. But they are endowed with
powers for pre&s;erving vegetable life, as animals
are for pre&s;erving animal life. Doth not the
&s;pringing of the &s;eed, the motion of the &s;ap, the
production of leaves, flowers, fruit, &amp;c. proceed
from a power in plants; as the beating of the
heart, the circulation of the blood, &amp;c. proceed
from a power in animals? There is not an ar|gument
for the latter that does not equally con|clude
for the former.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="412">
Next, as to the power of loco-motion. That
power is more perfect in animals; but plants po&s;|&s;e&s;s
a &s;hare of it, &s;uch as is nece&s;&s;ary for their
well-being: they grow both upward and down|ward;
and in their progre&s;s to maturity, they
are continually occupying new parts of &s;pace.
Plants, it is true, cannot, like animals, go out of
harms way; but it is curious to ob&s;erve, how
they exert that &s;hare of loco-motion they are en|dowed
with, to avoid harm. Upon the &s;lighte&s;t
touch, the &s;en&s;itive plant &s;hrinks back and folds
up its leaves, &s;imilar to a &s;nail, which on the
&s;lighte&s;t touch retires within its &s;hell. A new &s;pe|cies
of the &s;en&s;itive plant has been lately di&s;cover|ed.
If a fly perch upon one of its flower-leaves,
it clo&s;es in&s;tantly, and cru&s;hes the in&s;ect to death.
The nettle never fails to &s;ting the hand that touches
it. There is not an article of botany more admi|rable
than a contrivance vi&s;ible in many plants, to
take advantage of good weather, and to protect
them&s;elves again&s;t bad. They open and clo&s;e
their flowers and leaves, in different circum|&s;tances:
&s;ome clo&s;e before &s;un&s;et, &s;ome after:
&s;ome open to receive rain, &s;ome clo&s;e to avoid it.
The petals of many flowers expand in the &s;un;
but contract at night, or on the approach of rain.
After the &s;eeds are fecundated, the petals no
longer contract. The common goat&s;beard clo&s;es
up its flowers while the &s;un pa&s;&s;es the meridian.
The pimpernel expands its leaves at &s;un&s;et, and
<PB N="387" REF="413">
clo&s;es them at &s;unri&s;ing. All the trefoils may
&s;erve as a barometer to the hu&s;bandman: they
always contract their leaves on an impending
&s;torm. Some plants follow the &s;un, &s;ome turn
from it. Mo&s;t di&s;cous flowers follow the &s;un;
which has been long ob&s;erved of the &s;un-flower,
while young and tender. The leaves of the mal|low
tribe, follow daily the cour&s;e of the &s;un,
from ea&s;t by &s;outh to we&s;t. Many plants on the
&s;un's rece&s;s vary the po&s;ition of their leaves;
which is &s;tiled the <HI>&s;leep of plants.</HI> Every bo|tani&s;t,
after Pliny, has ob&s;erved this in a field of
clover. A &s;ingular plant was lately di&s;covered in
Bengal. Its leaves are in continual motion all day
long; but when night approaches, they fall from
an erect po&s;ture down to re&s;t.</P>
<P>A plant has a power of directing its roots for
procuring food. A quantity of fine compo&s;t for
flowers, happened to be laid at the root of a full
grown elm; where it lay neglected three or four
years. When moved, in order to be carried off,
there appeared a net-work of elm-fibres &s;pread
through the whole heap. No fibres had be|fore
appeared at the &s;urface of the ground.
The red whortleberry, a low evergreen plant,
grows naturally on the tops of our highe&s;t hills,
among &s;tones and gravel. This &s;hrub was planted
as an edging to a rich border, under a fruit-wall.
In two or three years, it over-ran the adjoining
deep-laid gravel-walk; and &s;eemed to fly from
<PB N="388" REF="414">
the border, in which not a &s;ingle runner appear|ed.
Were our London aldermen equally tem|perate,
they might partake of turtle and veni&s;on
with &s;afety. An effort to come at food in a bad
&s;ituation, is extremely remarkable in the follow|ing
in&s;tance. Among the ruins of Newabbey,
formerly a mona&s;tery in Galloway, there grows
on the top of a wall, a plane-tree about twenty
feet high. Straitened for nouri&s;hment in that
barren &s;ituation, it &s;everal years ago directed roots
down the &s;ide of the wall, till they reached the
ground ten feet below; and now, the nouri&s;h|ment
it afforded to the&s;e roots during the time of
their de&s;cending, is amply repaid, having every year
&s;ince that time made vigorous &s;hoots. From the
top of the wall to the &s;urface of the earth, the&s;e
roots have not thrown out a &s;ingle fibre; but are
now united into a pretty thick root.</P>
<P>Plants, when forced from their natural po&s;ition,
are endowed with a power to re&s;tore them&s;elves.
A hop-plant twi&s;ting round a &s;tick, directs its
cour&s;e from &s;outh to we&s;t as the &s;un does. Un|twi&s;t
it, and tie it in the oppo&s;ite direction: it
dies. Leave it loo&s;e in the wrong direction: it
recovers its natural direction in a &s;ingle night.
The leaves of all trees and vegetables, have an
upper and an under &s;urface, which never vary.
Twi&s;t a branch &s;o as to invert its leaves, and fix it
in that po&s;ition. If left in any degree loo&s;e, it
untwi&s;ts it&s;elf gradually, till the leaves be re&s;tored
<PB N="389" REF="415">
to their natural po&s;ition. What better can an a|nimal
do for its well-fare? A root of a tree,
meeting with a ditch in its progre&s;s, is laid open
to the air. What follows? it alters its cour&s;e like
a rational being, dips into the ground, &s;urrounds
the ditch, ri&s;es on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide to its wonted
di&s;tance from the &s;urface, and then proceeds in
its original direction. Lay a wet &s;punge near a
root laid open to the air: the root will direct its
cour&s;e to the &s;punge. Change the place of the
&s;punge: the root varies its direction.</P>
<P>Such animals as are naturally weak, exert their
&s;elf-motive power to remedy that defect, by join|ing
in &s;ociety. Plants are not capable of &s;ociety;
but &s;everal of them &s;upply their natural weakne&s;s,
by exerting their &s;elf-motive power in a manner
that would do honour to an animal. The eco|nomy
of &s;candent plants is in that re&s;pect admi|rable.
Ob&s;erve how they direct their cour&s;e to
any thing that can &s;upport them. Thru&s;t a pole
into the ground, within a moderate di&s;tance: a
&s;candent plant directs its cour&s;e to the pole, lays
hold of it, and ri&s;es on it to its natural height. A
honey&s;uckle proceeds in its cour&s;e, till it be too
long for &s;upporting its weight; and then &s;trength|ens
it&s;elf by &s;hooting into a &s;piral. If it meet
with another plant of the &s;ame kind, they coa|le&s;ce
for mutual &s;upport; the one &s;crewing to the
right, the other to the left. If a honey&s;uckle
twig meet with a dead branch, it &s;crews from
<PB N="390" REF="416">
the right to the left. The cla&s;pers of briony &s;hoot
in a &s;piral, and lay hold of whatever comes in
their way for &s;upport. If after completing a &s;pi|ral
of three rounds they meet with nothing, they
try again by altering their cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Nature has al&s;o provided a remedy for trees
that grow too fa&s;t in a fruitful &s;oil. Some form
the upper part of the weak and tender &s;tem into
a &s;ort of &s;crew; which is &s;tronger than a &s;treight
line. This among others is the ca&s;e of the larix.
A tree bent by too fa&s;t growing, pu&s;hes out all
its lateral branches on the convex &s;ide, in a di|rection
between perpendicular and horizontal, as
if it were expanding wings to rai&s;e it&s;elf up. There
are at Kames, elms that when twenty feet high
were bent down by overgrowing, the top almo&s;t
touching the ground. In that po&s;ition they con|tinued
&s;everal years, till they were rai&s;ed by la|teral
branches as above de&s;cribed; and they are
now perfectly erect.</P>
<P>The economy of &s;ome water-plants is &s;ingular.
As the <HI>farina foecundans</HI> cannot operate under
water, a water-lillie, be the water deep or &s;hal|low,
pu&s;hes up its flower-&s;tems till they reach the
&s;urface, and then flowers in open air.</P>
<P>The compari&s;on between plants and animals,
may be carried a great way farther. There are
powers in every animal, to &s;truggle for health by
expelling di&s;ea&s;es. All that a &s;urgeon can do in
the ca&s;e of a broken bone, is to re&s;tore it to its
<PB N="391" REF="417">
natural po&s;ition. Nature performs the cure, by
pouring into the broken part a liquid matter,
which, hardening into bone, unites the parts
firmly together. Sydenham, prince of phy&s;icians,
defines a fever to be an effort of nature to throw
out of the body what is noxious. The provi&s;ion
of nature for re&s;toring a maimed animal, is re|markable
in the lob&s;ter and crab. The feeling of
the&s;e animals is at the tip of their claws. When
the tip of a claw is brui&s;ed or broken, the whole
claw falls off, and another in its &s;tead quickly ar|rives
at maturity<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Bonnet is &s;trangely puzzled to account for this fact. He &s;uppo&s;es, that numberle&s;s embryos of every portion of every claw of a lob&s;ter, were originally created; that every lob&s;ter is full of &s;uch embryos, &s;o artificially placed, as that when part of a claw is broken off, an embryo corre&s;ponding to that part is at hand, which is put in motion in order to repair the lo&s;s.</NOTE>. Are not yawning, &s;tretch|ing,
&s;ighing, weeping, efforts of nature to throw
off a burden? There are &s;imilar powers in plants
to remedy what is noxious. A wound in a tree is
cured like a wound in an animal: the &s;eparated
parts unite; and the tree is covered with bark as
formerly. If part of a branch or of a root be cut
off, the want is &s;upplied by a number of &s;mall
&s;hoots, i&s;&s;uing from the place where the cut was
made.</P>
<P>The foregoing facts exhibit a &s;trong re&s;em|blance
between plants and animals, with re&s;pect
<PB N="392" REF="418">
to the &s;elf-motive power. The motion of the
heart in animals, of the arteries, of the inte&s;tines,
of the lungs, cannot be explained by any known
law of mechani&s;m; and as little, the &s;pringing of
the &s;eed in plants, the o&s;cillatory motion of the
&s;ap, the production of leaves, flowers, fruit, &amp;c.
The&s;e various effects proceed from a &s;elf-motive
power in plants, as well as in animals; and by
that power chiefly, are organized bodies di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
from brute-matter. A plant exerts this
power without con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, becau&s;e con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s
is not the property of any plant. But &s;o far
the re&s;emblance holds, that an animal, though
endowed with con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, exerts the &s;ame power
blindly, without being con&s;cious of the exertion.
The power is in both exerted uniformly without
interruption; and each individual may be con&s;i|dered
as a &s;ort of <HI>perpetuum mobile.</HI></P>
<P>The power that a plant or an animal has to re|medy
any di&s;order or hurt, differs from the power
of carrying on life, in the following particular,
that it is quie&s;cent till there be occa&s;ion to exert
it: it is exerted by circum&s;tances de&s;tructive to
the health of the plant or animal; and independ|ent
of &s;uch circum&s;tances, it would contradict the
beauty and order of nature that it &s;hould be ex|erted.</P>
<P>There are other powers in animals termed in|&s;tinctive,
by which they act blindly without any
view to con&s;equences: hunger prompts them to
<PB N="393" REF="419">
eat, and cold to take &s;helter, without reflection
or fore&s;ight. In&s;tinctive actions differ from tho&s;e
above mentioned, being attended with con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s,
though not with fore&s;ight: a duckling, e|ven
where hatched by a hen, goes in&s;tinctively in|to
water: it knows where it is going; but knows
not for what end. To in&s;tinctive powers in ani|mals,
there are no re&s;embling powers in plants:
we admit not in plants any knowledge or con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.
Far le&s;s do plants exert any actions
that re&s;emble voluntary actions in animals.</P>
<P>After much labour be&s;towed on botany, and
many volumes compo&s;ed on that &s;ubject, it ap|pears
very little advanced above infancy: no o|ther
&s;cience has made &s;o &s;low a progre&s;s. I prai&s;e
the diligence of our botani&s;ts: &s;ome of them have
great merit. But, as far as I under&s;tand, their
&s;tudy has been mo&s;tly confined to give names to
plants, and to di&s;tribute them into cla&s;&s;es; not by
di&s;tingui&s;hing their powers and properties, but by
certain vi&s;ible marks. This is an excellent pre|paration
for compo&s;ing a dictionary: but it leaves
us in the dark as to the higher parts of the &s;ci|ence,
&s;uch as are the mo&s;t proper to engage a
thinking and rational mind. No per&s;on who has
given attention to the conduct of Providence, can
entertain any doubt, that the powers and proper|ties
of plants are given for beneficial purpo&s;es.

&s;hall direct their enquiries to the

become an intere&s;ting &s;cience, not inferior to any
other in dignity and importance: then &s;hall we
have occa&s;ion to admire more and more the wi&s;|dom
of the creation. How plea&s;ant to have it ob|&s;erved,
that the humble&s;t plant is framed with no
le&s;s &s;kill, than the mo&s;t elevated animal!</P>
<P>So much upon a compari&s;on between plants
and animals with re&s;pect to motion. Another
compari&s;on occurs, no le&s;s curious, and &s;till more
intere&s;ting, that the external frame is nicely ad|ju&s;ted
to the internal, &s;o as to accompli&s;h in per|fection
the ends of Providence. No one who has
&s;tudied natural hi&s;tory, but mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of this
agreement in the animal creation. How well ad|apted
are the claws of a lion and the talons of an
eagle, to their rapacious nature. What &s;ort of fi|gure
would an innocent lamb make, or timid
dove, with &s;uch arms! The &s;hape of a fi&s;h is vi|&s;ibly
contrived for moving in water: how ab|&s;urd
would the animal be, if it had an aver&s;ion to
that element. A duckling waddles by in&s;tinct
to the fir&s;t water it &s;ees; for whi$h it is fitted by
its oily feathers: &s;uch an in&s;tinct in a chicken,
would be highly incongruous. The hoof of a
hor&s;e$ corre&s;ponds to his &s;hallow under&s;tanding:
fingers would be incon&s;i&s;tent with the u&s;e that na|ture
intends him for. Without fingers a man
<PB N="395" REF="421">
would be a mi&s;erable creature: he would always
be contriving, but without power to execute<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Wonderfully &s;hallow is the reflection of Helvetius, that the only excellency of a man above a hor&s;e, is his having fingers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This truth would be equally evident in plants,
were their nature and qualities as well known as
of animals. A plant is an organized being, as
well as an animal: if the external frame of the
latter be adapted to its internal frame, can we
doubt of the &s;ame economy with re&s;pect to the
former? In whatever manner particles of matter
are formed into an organic body, of which we
know nothing, one thing is certain, that the or|ganic
body acquires a nature very different from
that of its con&s;tituent particles, and al&s;o new powers
qualifying it for acting according to its de&s;tina|tion.
The power of gravity, of re&s;i&s;tance, of
continuing motion, e&s;&s;ential to matter in general,
will never by any combination produce any thing
but motion; but the power of producing a body
&s;imilar to it&s;elf, inherent in all organic bodies, is
far &s;uperior to the powers mentioned; and there|fore
mu&s;t be a new power added in the formation
of every organic body.</P>
<P>As plants were originally created of many &s;pe|cies,
each &s;pecies has powers peculiar to it&s;elf,
which pre&s;erve the different &s;pecies di&s;tinct, and
<PB N="396" REF="422">
con&s;equently pre&s;erve uniformity among the indi|viduals
of the &s;ame &s;pecies. The&s;e powers, va|riou&s;ly
modified in every different &s;pecies, are ex|erted
in the propagation of new plants, with leaves,
flowers, &s;eed, &amp;c. peculiar to each &s;pecies. And
as a perfect agreement between the external and
internal frame of plants, as well as of animals, is
undoubtedly the plan of nature, incapable of de|fect
or over&s;ight, it may be taken for granted,
that each external part contributes to the well-being
of the plant, and that any alteration would
be hurtful: to exchange, for example, the leaves
of an oak and an a&s;h, would be prejudicial to
both, perhaps de&s;tructive. Were we acquaint|ed
with the nature of different plants, we &s;hould
be able to account for the difference of &s;ize, of
leaves, of roots, of colour, and of &s;eed. We
&s;hould al&s;o be able to explain why &s;ome plants
&s;pring early, &s;ome late; why &s;ome are adapted
to a hot climate, &s;ome to a cold; why &s;ome
thrive be&s;t in dry &s;oil, &s;ome in wet; why &s;ome
produce flowers before leaves; and why &s;ome ne|ver
&s;hed the leaf.</P>
<P>This &s;peculation opens a wide field for ob&s;erva|tion
and experiment, that may worthily employ the
mo&s;t acute philo&s;ophers. Why not then attempt
to peep into the nature and con&s;titution of plants?
The be&s;t we can make of that &s;ubject, will, I am
afraid, be but gue&s;s-work. But fair and rational
<PB N="397" REF="423">
conjectures, which we may hope for, will give
&s;ome entertainment to the curious inquirer. If
we de&s;pair of acquiring &s;uch knowledge in the
internal con&s;truction of plants, as to explain all
the differences above mentioned, we may at lea&s;t
hop to di&s;cover facts that will illu&s;trate the agree|ment
between external and internal &s;tructure. I
venture to &s;ugge&s;t an in&s;tance or two. Some
plants draw mo&s;t of their nouri&s;hment from the
&s;oil, &s;ome from the air. Do not &s;mall leaves cor|re&s;pond
to the former, and large leaves to the lat|ter?
I have &s;een a hou&s;e-leek growing vigour|ou&s;ly
on a dry mud wall, excluding rain entirely
from the roots. But it has thick leaves, and
many in number, which fit it for drawing its nou|ri&s;hment
from the air. It is not the light, nor
the &s;un, that make plants grow erect, but the
appointment of nature. A &s;candent plant has a
tendency to grow erect like other plants; but as
it is too weak to &s;tand erect, it has tendrils or
cla&s;pers, to lay hold of any &s;upport within reach.
Why do certain trees never &s;hed the leaf, even in
this country? Is it not a rational conjecture,
that they are fitted by nature to bear cold, and
that the cold of this climate does not &s;u&s;pend
their power of drawing nouri&s;hment all the year
round?</P>
<P>Were this important branch of botany dili|gently
&s;tudied, I fondly hope, that con&s;iderable.
<PB N="398" REF="424">
in&s;ight might be obtained into the nature of
plants, and po&s;&s;ibly into their medicinal effects.
By that &s;tudy, the natural hi&s;tory of plants may
become no le&s;s in&s;tructive and entertaining, than
that of animals.</P>

<P>EQuivocal generation is by all philo&s;ophers ex|ploded
from animal life; but &s;ome continue
to he&s;itate with re&s;pect to vegetable life. Ani|mals,
&s;ay they, wandering from place to place,
can &s;tock the earth with their progeny; but plants
are fixed to the earth they grow in. It is urged,
that plants are never wanting, where the &s;oil is pro|per
for them; that i&s;lands rai&s;ed by a volcano at
a di&s;tance from any &s;hore, are &s;oon covered with
gra&s;s; that mu&s;hrooms and other organized bodies,
&s;pring from rotten &s;tumps of trees, where they
were never &s;een before; that various plants ri&s;e
on the foundation of old hou&s;es, when cleared of
the rubbi&s;h; and that upon liming or dunging,
white clover &s;prings up in the very central parts of
a wide extended barren moor, though the &s;eed
of white clover has not wings to carry it to a di|&s;tance.
<PB N="399" REF="425">
To account for the&s;e &s;ingular facts, it is held,
that both plants and animals were originally or|ganized
atoms or embryos, having all nece&s;&s;ary
parts in miniature; that the earth, the water, the air,
are full of &s;uch atoms, which begin not to unfold
them&s;elves into plants or animals, till they happen
to meet with a proper <HI>matrix</HI> or <HI>nidus;</HI> that in
their original &s;tate, they are too minute for any
of our &s;en&s;es, but that they become vi&s;ible by ex|pan&s;ion.</P>
<P>What means were employed at the creation to
cover the earth with plants, may be conjectured,
but is far beyond the reach of evidence. It is to
me a natural conjecture, that a number of plants
and animals were originally created, and endued
with animals were originally created, and endued
with proper powers of generation; and that from
the&s;e, all the plants and animals exi&s;ting in the
world are de&s;cended. In that belief, I cannot
&s;ubmit to organized atoms, becau&s;e there is no e|vidence
of them, and becau&s;e they are unnece&s;|&s;ary.
To illu&s;trate this conjecture, I add the &s;ub|&s;tance
of a letter I had the plea&s;ure to receive
from and eminent naturali&s;t<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dr Walker mini&s;ter of Moffat.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&startq;The doctrine of equivocal generation was
univer&s;ally admitted, till about 130 years ago;
not, however, &s;o much by the ancients, as by
the half-enlightened moderns. They &s;aw
mites in chee&s;e; and myriads of flies and creep|ing
<PB N="400" REF="426">
things in a dunghill, or a putrid mar&s;h.
Ignorance of the natural hi&s;tory of the&s;e ani|mals,
made way for the conjecture, that they
were mere &s;pontaneous productions, the effect,
not of generation, but of corruption. This
doctrine indeed was confined to the&s;e poor in|&s;ects,
and never was extended to a lion or a
hor&s;e. They did not advert, that to form a
maggot and an elephant, require equal power
and wi&s;dom. The &s;ame di&s;tinction was car|ried
into the vegetable kingdom. Becau&s;e
no &s;eed appeared to the naked eye in a fern, a
mu&s;hroom, or in any of the mo&s;s-tribe, it was
a&s;&s;erted, that none exi&s;ted; and while the oak
and the laurel were dignified with generative
faculties, the&s;e humble plants were vilified as
the progeny of putrefaction. Equivocal gene|ration
became thus an a&s;ylum for ignorance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am clear to bani&s;h equivocal generation
from vegetables, as well as from animals; and
I boldly maintain as a fundamental truth in na|ture,
<HI>omne vivum ex ovo.</HI> By the <HI>ovum</HI> in
vegetables, I mean, a &s;eed, or any part of a
plant that contains a bud, or is capable of
forming it. They are in effect the &s;ame; be|cau&s;e
every bud, as well as every &s;eed, con|tains
the embryo of a future plant. I know of
no other way by which plants are propagated,
but by &s;eeds, &s;uckers, and layers. The la&s;t is
<PB N="401" REF="427">
imitated by art, in cuttings, grafting, and ino|culation.
Some late experiments are mention|ed
of propagating trees by planting their leaves;
but I do not believe it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Plants, it is true, are de&s;titute of locomo|tion;
and by means of &s;uckers and layers, they
can only cover contiguous &s;pots. But nume|rous
and wonderful are the expedients, practi|&s;ed
by nature to di&s;&s;eminate plants. Some &s;eed|ve&s;&s;els
bur&s;t with an explo&s;ive force, and throw
the &s;eed to a di&s;tance. This is the ca&s;e of our
whin: did the &s;eeds fall perpendicularly down,
they would be &s;uffocated in the heart of an im|penetrable
bu&s;h. Some &s;eed ve&s;&s;els open not
till wet with rain; but the &s;eeds are found to
&s;uffer by drought, and to require immediate
moi&s;ture when &s;own. The a&s;h, and the plane,
have heavy &s;eeds; but the&s;e &s;eeds are &s;upplied
with wings: a gale of wind carries them from
their lofty &s;ituation to a di&s;tance, and they re|main
on the tree till the gale comes. The &s;eeds
of humble plants, that they may ri&s;e and re|move,
&s;pread more &s;ail to the wind: the thi&s;tle
&s;preads his beard; and away he travels to fix
his re&s;idence in remote parts. A plant of this
kind, <HI>Erigeron Canaden&s;e,</HI> was imported from
Canada about one hundred years ago, into the
Paris garden. It is now &s;pread as a wild plant
over France, Holland, Germany, Italy, and
<PB N="402" REF="428">
it is &s;aid over Sicily. It is &s;pread to &s;uch a de|gree
over the &s;outh of England, as to be in|li&s;ted
among the indigenous plants. Some
&s;eeds, &s;uch as our clot-bur, are of an adhe&s;ive
nature: they lay hold of animals that come
near them, and are &s;pread far and near.</P>
<P>Many other agents are employed by nature,
to &s;tock the earth with plants. The &s;ea and
rivers waft more &s;eeds than they do &s;ails, from
one part of the world to another. I have
found &s;eeds ca&s;t a&s;hore in the Hebrides, that
had been dropt accidentally into the &s;ea among
the We&s;t-India i&s;lands. The i&s;land of A&s;cen|&s;ion,
is the dro&s;s of a volcano of a recent date.
Its immen&s;e di&s;tance from land&punc; renders its ac|qui&s;ition
of &s;eeds difficult and precarious. I
know but of two ways for &s;upplying it with
&s;eeds, one by the waters of the ocean, the o|ther
by birds. By one or other of the&s;e ways,
it has got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of three &s;pecies of plants,
and only three; a &s;ingularity no where el&s;e
known<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In no &s;uch i&s;land was there ever found an animal that was not imported. And why &s;hould we admit &s;pon|taneous generation, to be more po&s;&s;ible in a plant than in an animal?</NOTE>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq; The animal creation is &s;upported by the ve|getable;
but in return, vegetables owe much
of their progre&s;s to birds and graminivorous
quadrupeds, which are prime agents in the di&s;|&s;emination
<PB N="403" REF="429">
of plants. Many birds live on fruits
and berries: the pulp is their aliment; and
they di&s;charge the &s;eeds unimpaired, and &s;pread
them every where. The&s;e &s;eeds are heavy,
and unprovided with any <HI>apparatus</HI> for flight;
but the birds &s;erve them for wings. Hence
may be &s;een plantations of holly, yew, white-beam,
rowan, &s;pindletree, hawthorn, and ju|niper,
formed by the birds of the air, upon im|pending
clifs and inacce&s;&s;ible precipices. Be|cau&s;e
the mi&s;&s;elto grows upon trees, and has no
flower that can be perceived; it was reckoned
formerly a product of equivocal generation.
It was concluded that its large, round, heavy,
berries, were not the &s;eeds of the plant, be|cau&s;e
they might fall to the ground, but never
could mount up into trees. No berries are
more palatable to birds of the thru&s;h kind; and
it is they who plant them on high and di&s;tant
trees. It is extremely remarkable, that the ve|gerating
power of &s;eeds, in&s;tead of being im|paired
in the &s;tomach of birds, &s;eems to be
fortified. The &s;eeds of the magnolia, import|ed
from America, commonly refu&s;e to vegetate
under the management of the mo&s;t &s;kilful gar|deners.
But I have heard, that the&s;e &s;eeds,
when voided by turkies, never fail to grow.
It is well known, that the dung of dome&s;tic a|nimals,
while it fertilizes a garden, fills it
with weeds. It approaches to a miracle, that
<PB N="404" REF="430">
&s;eeds &s;hould with&s;tand the power of animal di|ge&s;tion,
which no other vegetable &s;ub&s;tance
can do. Here is a mea&s;ure laid down by Pro|vidence
for the pre&s;ervation and di&s;&s;emination
of &s;eeds, that I cannot reflect upon without
wonder.</P>
<P>In order to fill the earth with plants, any o|ther
method except by &s;eeds, &s;uckers, and lay|ers,
appears to me unnece&s;&s;ary, and therefore
improbable. Farewell then to equivocal gene|ration.
I can &s;carce write of it, without be|ing
a little ruffled; &s;o ill it corre&s;ponds with the
more augu&s;t and comfortable ideas of creation,
which have made a principal article of happi|ne&s;s
in my life.&endq;</P>
<P>So far my corre&s;pondent. I join heartily with
him in his conclu&s;ion, that the known means for
&s;toring the earth with plants, which are con&s;picu|ous
marks of de&s;igning wi&s;dom, are in all appear|ance
&s;o completely adequate, that to &s;earch for
unknown means, &s;eems to be an idle attempt.</P>
<P>Having thus re&s;tored the plan of nature, which
in the &s;imple&s;t manner employs &s;eeds as the chief
means for propagating plants, we proceed to con|&s;ider
how &s;eeds are formed. Many philo&s;ophers,
holding it to be incredible, that a plant, or even
an animal, &s;hould be endued with a power to
produce its own likene&s;s, have embraced an opi|nion,
that all the plants and animals that ever ex|i&s;ted,
or that ever will exi&s;t, were formed origi|nally,
<PB N="405" REF="431">
not plants or animals, but embryos of tho&s;e
inclo&s;ed in an egg or &s;eed, which when depo&s;ited
in a proper <HI>nidus</HI> or <HI>matrix,</HI> grow up to a plant
or animal, and then decay. And to account for
future generations, it is held, that every embryo
contains within it &s;maller embryos without end,
like cups of different &s;izes ca&s;ed one within ano|ther.
The&s;e philo&s;ophers mu&s;t go &s;till farther.
To account for each &s;eed producing a tree, and
that tree producing &s;eed, it mu&s;t al&s;o be held,
that the embryo inclo&s;ed in a &s;eed contains &s;maller
embryos decrea&s;ing in &s;ize without end; and that
each of the&s;e &s;maller embryos contains another &s;e|ries
of decrea&s;ing embryos, al&s;o without end.
Here are infinites upon infinites, without end. To
avoid the intricacy of infinites upon infinites, &s;ome
philo&s;ophers have varied the &s;y&s;tem a little, with a
view to render it, as they think, more &s;imple, by
recurring to organized atoms, exploded above<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Bonnet upon organized bodies.</NOTE>.
But this &s;y&s;tem, not to repeat what is &s;aid again&s;t
it above, is only in appearance more &s;imple: it
re&s;olves into infinites upon infinites like the for|mer,
and is in reality no le&s;s intricate. Take
any of the &s;uppo&s;ed embryos, hovering in air,
&s;wimming in water, or fixed in earth: give it a
proper <HI>matrix,</HI> and let it become a tree with &s;eed.
As each &s;eed may produce a tree, and each tree
produce &s;eed which may al&s;o become trees, it is
<PB N="406" REF="432">
manife&s;t, that an infinite number of embryos mu&s;t
have been contained in the fir&s;t embryo, and an
infinite number in every one of that infinite num|ber.</P>
<P>That every &s;eed contains an embryo-plant, is a
valuable di&s;covery in natural hi&s;tory; but that there
is a decrea&s;ing &s;eries of embryos within every
&s;eed, is a mere conceit, a&s;&s;umed without the lea&s;t
appearance of truth. So far from future plants
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting in a &s;eed without end, that even the
plant immediately produced from a &s;eed, does not
&s;ub&s;i&s;t in the &s;eed with all its parts entire. The
plume and radicle alone &s;ub&s;i&s;t in it; and the o|ther
parts are produced in the cour&s;e of growing.
But let us give way to the &s;uppo&s;ition of an in|finite
&s;eries, to &s;ee what can be made of it. Wri|ters
&s;top &s;hort, and leave the reader in the dark,
preci&s;ely where he needs light the mo&s;t. A &s;eed is
laid in earth: by what mechanical power is vege|tation
produced and continued during the life of
the plant? And by what mechanical power does
motion commence in the foetus of an animal, and
the blood circulate? When a &s;eed happens to be
inverted in the ground, with its radicle above,
and its plume below; what is the mechanic power
that makes them wreathe about the &s;eed till $word$
radicle get into earth and the plume into air $word$ ?
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">To a&s;cend and de&s;cend is not the ultimate view in the&s;e two parts, but to get into the air and earth. As &s;eeds are generally depo&s;ited on or near the &s;urface of the ground, the plume a&s;cends and the radicle de&s;cends. But pla$e a &s;eed in an inverted flower-po$: the radicle a&s;cends and the plume de&s;cends: the fir&s;t pur&s;ues his road into the earth; and the other into the air.</NOTE>
<PB N="407" REF="433">
Unle&s;s the&s;e particulars can be accounted for me|chanically,
in vain are embryos created in the brain
of vi&s;ionary writers. They mu&s;t admit a power
even in the &s;malle&s;t embryo, to expand it&s;elf in|to
a plant or animal, where it happens upon a
proper nidus. I &s;ay, they mu&s;t admit that power;
and yet the admi&s;&s;ion de&s;troys their hypothe&s;is,
root and branch. A &s;eed thrown into the ground
would re&s;t there for ever, were it not endued
with a power, to begin vegetation, and to con|tinue
it. It grows into a tree: why may not
that tree be endued with a power to form its own
&s;eed? If &s;o, there is no nece&s;&s;ity to go farther
back: organized atoms or embryos mu&s;t vani&s;h,
becau&s;e there is no u&s;e for them. Power in a tree
to form its &s;eeds, is no more extraordinary than
that of &s;ucking juices from the earth, and con|verting
them into its own &s;ub&s;tance, a power
that every plant is admitted to have. And if
plants have power to form &s;eed, there &s;urely can
be no he&s;itation in a&s;cribing the &s;ame power to
animals. Can any thing be more &s;imple, or more
agreeable to the analogy of nature, than that the
Almighty, who created plants and animals,
<PB N="408" REF="434">
&s;hould endue them with a power to propagate
their kind? Are we not informed of this by eye|&s;ight;
and can any &s;olid argument be urged a|gain&s;t
what we &s;ee? Thus the operations of na|ture,
when under&s;tood, turn out no le&s;s illu&s;tri|ous
for their &s;implicity than for their exten&s;ive
effects.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this e&s;&s;ay with a pa&s;&s;age of another
letter from my corre&s;pondent above mentioned.
&startq;As for the doctrine of organized atoms diffu&s;ed
through the univer&s;e in order to be converted
into animals and vegetables, it is not counte|nanced
by any thing within the &s;phere of my
knowledge. No facts are adduced, nor do I
recollect any, to &s;upport it. I adhere more and
more to this plain truth, that all plants and a|nimals
are propagated by &s;eeds, or analogous
organizations; which are formed out of unor|ganized
matter, by the power of the vital prin|ciple
of plants and animals, in the way of &s;ecre|tion.
By analogous organizations I mean a
bud of a tree, a &s;ection of a polypus, and &s;uch|like
organized parts, that are capable like &s;eeds
of growing up into a complete plant or ani|mal.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;ecretory power of plants and animals is
indeed a wonder. A lyncean anatomi&s;t, with
his great magnifiers, cannot penetrate the dark|ne&s;s
in which it is involved. The tran&s;muta|tion
of matter by animal and vegetable &s;ecre|tion,
<PB N="409" REF="435">
is obvious to every eye. By what means
it is performed, &s;eems to be that high legerde|main
which nature will never reveal. But if
by this power bread and water can be changed
into fle&s;h and blood, into bones and &s;inews,
into the Argus' eye on the peacock's tail; if by
this power &s;imple water can be converted into
