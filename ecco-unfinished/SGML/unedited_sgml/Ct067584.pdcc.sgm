<HEAD>THE RETORT COURTEOUS; OR CANDID APPEAL to the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>ON a &s;uppo&s;ition (I may venture to &s;ay a certainty) that the Proprietors of Drury-lane Theatre have not us'd me with that candour, which is unque&s;tionably due to an Author, who many years ago contributed his MITE to the entertainment of the Town, I am in|due'd to publi&s;h the following letters, by way of APPEAL to the Frequenters of the Theatres.</P>
<P>Some of my friends had repeatedly &s;oli|cited me to offer my tragedy of Dido to the Proprietors of Drury-lane Hou&s;e, as the
<PB N="4" REF="3">part of the Heroine could be &s;o admirably play'd by Mrs. SIDDONS: They at la&s;t, as <HI>Polonius</HI> &s;ays,
<Q><L>&mdash;"by labour&s;ome petition</L>
<L>"Wrung from me my &s;low leave."</L></Q>I accordingly &s;ent, above two years ago, the tragedy and a comedy to THOMAS I INLEY, E&s;quire, the Manager, and with them the following letter.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<LETTER>
<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have taken the liberty of &s;ending a tragedy and a comedy, both of which I flatter my&s;elf would make a re&s;pectable appearance on your &s;tage. As to the tragedy there can be no doubt of its &s;ucce&s;s; &s;ince it was received with applau&s;e above &s;eventeen years ago, tho' it was got up in a very &s;lovenly manner, and the Heroine play'd by a Lady, who was never very great in characters <HI>truly-pathetic</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This elegant Actre&s;s fell &s;hort of her u&s;ual excellence in tragic characters of the SOFTER call.</NOTE> I withdrew the piece on account of an unhap|py quarrel with Mr. GARRICK, or it would probably, $$er now, have afforded your cele|brated Actre&s;s a farther opportunity of di&s;|playing her great talents.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>As the Comedy has never appear'd its &s;uc|ce&s;s cannot be a&s;certain'd. However, from the (perhaps) flattering applau&s;e, be&s;tow'd upon it by &s;ome acknowledg'd judges. I have no rea&s;on to doubt of its favourable reception, &s;ince the <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> of the piece, with le&s;s hu|mour and character than it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, would &s;ecure its &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;add to this, that it can be capitally play'd at your theatre.</P>
<P>I have by me &s;everal Dramas of the tragic and comic ca&s;$, all of which have had &s;uch &s;anction, as makes me believe that none of them would do you &s;tage the lea$$ di&s;credit.</P>
<P>When you have peru&s;ed the Pieces, I &s;hould be proud of an interview; as, I think, it would be for the intere&s;t of your theatre to encourage an Author, who&s;e &s;ituation is independent, and to whom &s;tage-emoluments are only a &s;econ|dary con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, with plea&s;ure, wait on you, when|ever you &s;hall favour me with a line to that purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>From the <HI>&s;udden</HI> return of the two pieces, I &s;u&s;pected that they had been &s;ent back to me <HI>unread;</HI> as I had been previou&s;ly informed that every manu&s;cript play, offered to that theatre, was peru&s;ed by <HI>each</HI> of the Proprietors, be|fore it was accepted or rejected: in con&s;e|quence of which I wrote to ALL the Proprie|tors as follows.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have received a billet, &s;igned T. We&s;tley, wherein the writer informs me he is directed
<PB N="7" REF="6">to acquaint me, the Proprietors of Drury-lane theatre are of opinion, that my two pieces cannot be produced with advantage to the theatre&mdash;I wi&s;h that one of you had favoured me with a line on the occa&s;ion; Mr. We&s;tley would not then have been <HI>privy</HI> to your re|fu&s;al of the pieces, which may po&s;&s;ibly be a means of their being rejected <HI>el&s;ewhere.</HI> It is no new thing for a Manager, even without fair examination, to refu&s;e a piece, that has been refu&s;ed at a rival theatre. If any of you by letter, had offered a daughter as a bride, what would he think of that Gentleman, who, in&s;tead of a <HI>private</HI> an&s;wer, &s;hould &s;end a <HI>&s;er|vant</HI> to report his refu&s;al?</P>
<P>Had your cen&s;ure fallen &s;ingly on the Co|medy, I might <HI>perhaps</HI> have thought it ju&s;t; but, as poor Dido is involved in your anathe|ma, I cannot help thinking my two dramatic Children are thus cruelly treated, on account of their literary Father. It was many years ago too-truly prophecied, that my quarrel with Mr. GARRICK would be an almo&s;t-in&s;u|perable ob&s;tacle to my &s;ucce&s;s on the &s;tage. However, as I can inconte&s;$ibly prove <HI>that</HI> gentleman u&s;ed me mo&s;t illiberally, it is ra|ther hard that my dramatic Character &s;hould
<PB N="8" REF="7">&s;uffer, thro' my lenity of not laying before the public his unju&s;tifiable treatment.</P>
<P>It appears to me very unaccountable that a tragedy, which Mr. GARRICK'S <HI>&s;ecret in|fluence was not able to damn,</HI> &s;hould be rejected, becau&s;e it was withdrawn by the author, on <HI>promi&s;e</HI> that it &s;hould re-appear, when it could be exhibited agreeably to his wi&s;h.&mdash;The &s;to|ry is conci&s;ely as follows.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick, for rea&s;ons too tedious to be told, objected to Dido; and, by his authority, kept it off the &s;tage from the year 1761 to 1767. Even then he would not agree to its repre&s;entation, but on the <HI>hard</HI> condition of bringing it out for Mr. <HI>Holland's</HI> benefit; hoping its fir&s;t appearance as a <HI>benefit-play</HI> would effectually cripple it. I &s;hould never have con&s;ented to Dido's appearance in &s;uch <HI>di&s;graceful</HI> manner, if Mr. Garrick had not a&s;&s;ured me, that a &s;ufficient number of nights &s;hould be left open for its Run, and at the &s;ame time in&s;inuated that another play, on the &s;ame &s;ubject, had been put into his hands, the &s;ucce&s;s of which the author was willing to try at a benefit.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<P>While the play was in rehear&s;al, he &s;aw to his <HI>great mortification</HI> that it <HI>would</HI> &s;ucceed, and on the day, preceding its fir&s;t repre&s;enta|tion, he hurried off to Bath, having either written, or permitted to appear in the Public Adverti&s;er (the then theatrical Gazette) a mo&s;t &s;candalous copy of doggerel ver&s;es again&s;t the tragedy, and without having fixed the &s;e|cond night of its exhibition. Its fir&s;t appear|ance was on Saturday, and the only night, in the &s;ucceeding week unengaged for a benefit, was Thur&s;day. After the play had met with &s;uch applau&s;e, I de&s;ired it might be given out for Thur&s;day, to which Mr. <HI>George Garrick,</HI> the Deputy-manager, tenaciou&s;ly objected; alledging he expected a COMMAND for that evening, and that he mu&s;t hear from his Bro|ther before he fixed the &s;econd night. He was, however, over-ruled by Mr. LACY. and the piece was play'd a &s;econd time. All the en&s;uing week was appointed for benefits, ex|cept Thur&s;day, and that evening the <HI>Earl of Warwick</HI> was to be play'd at the de&s;ire of the honourable CHARLES TOWNSEND, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Chan|cellor of the Exchequer. On application to that Gentleman, he politely relinqui&s;hed the reque&s;ted play; but Mrs. YATES's illne&s;s prevented the exhibition of my piece. The
<PB N="10" REF="9">third night therefore could not be fixed till that day month, on account of Pa&s;&s;ion-week, and the intervening benefits.</P>
<P>After the &s;econd night applications were made to me for the purcha&s;e of the copy. I wrote to Mr. Garrick then at Bath. He &s;ent me a &s;eemingly-&s;incere letter, congratulated me on the &s;ucce&s;s of the play, and di&s;&s;uaded me from publication. He arrived in town before the third repre&s;entation, and, though the part of Dido was obliged to be play'd by Mrs. William Barry, a &s;econd-rate actre&s;s, on account of Mrs. Yates's illne&s;s, the piece was re|ceived with great applau&s;e. We then mutually agreed to po&s;tpone the farther repre&s;entation (it being &s;o late as the 14th of May) till the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on, Mr. Garrick promi&s;ing to get up the piece with all po&s;&s;ible advantages; but a revolution happening from the purcha&s;e of Covent-Garden Theatre, Dido was deprived of Mr. <HI>Powel</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Yates.</HI></P>
<P>In October<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">November.</NOTE> following Mr. Garrick, with|out ever con&s;ulting me, allotted the parts of Aeneas and Dido to Reddi&s;h and Mrs. <HI>William Barry.</HI> I objected, as Mr. BARRY and Mrs. DANCER were then engaged at Drury-lane.
<PB N="11" REF="10">Mr. Garrick, after &s;ome warm expre&s;&s;ions, at length con&s;ented that the two parts &s;hould be given to Mr. Barry and Mrs. Dancer, and that the play &s;hould be brought out after Chri&s;t|mas. Mr. Barry's affairs in Ireland were in &s;o critical a &s;ituation, that he was obliged on a &s;ew hours' notice to &s;et out for Dublin. In his ab&s;ence the part of Dido was given to Mrs. Dancer, who expre&s;&s;ed a great liking to it. Mr. Barry, on his return, was applied to about &s;tudying Aeneas. He promi&s;ed to do it, if I would put off the play to another &s;ea&s;on, alledging he had no lei&s;ure for &s;tudy till the theatrical vacation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He afterwards &s;tudied a new part in <HI>Zenobia</HI> that &s;ea&s;on.</NOTE>. I would not con&s;ent, and de&s;ired a po&s;itive an&s;wer. He then told me he had neither read the part nor the play. I gave him a copy of the tragedy, and a meeting between us was appointed in his dre&s;&s;ing-room the next time he played. We met accordingly. After many he&s;itations, &s;hufflings, and ridiculous objections he de|clined the part. His objections were ea&s;ily refuted, and &s;o confu&s;ed was his behaviour, that I mu&s;t have been blind, not to have &s;een he was influenced by Mr. Garrick. I then a&s;ked him if he had any objection to Mrs.
<PB N="12" REF="11">Dancer's playing Dido. He a&s;&s;ured me &s;he would never play the character, unle&s;s he was in the piece. The play was therefore with|drawn on Mr. Garrick's <HI>promi&s;e</HI> that it &s;hould re-appear, whenever I &s;hould think it could be &s;atisfactorily performed.</P>
<P>I was &s;o highly irritated at Mr. Garrick's duplicity, that I wrote a narrative of our quar|rel from its fir&s;t ri&s;e, which happened in De|cember 1759, on account of the REGISTER-OFFICE; containing all the Letters and Oc|currences that pa&s;&s;ed between us. I &s;hould have publi&s;hed it, had I not been pre&s;&s;ingly di&s;&s;uaded by my friend Mr. Holland, who was at that time in expectation of purcha&s;ing a &s;hare in the theatre. I now repent that I &s;uffered my &s;elf to be di&s;&s;uaded, as the narrative would have excited the curio&s;ity and atten|tion of the literary world, and have convin|ced the public of the illiberal u&s;age, I met with from that great Actor and Manager. It may not yet be too late; for if Dido mu&s;t be denied an appearance on the &s;tage, its injured Author has &s;urely a right to vindicate his dra|matic character by Publication.</P>
<P>From the above true &s;late of the ca&s;e, I would a&s;k if a play, that &s;ucceeded again&s;t all
<PB N="13" REF="12">the uncandid practices of a great Manager&mdash;a play, that was got up in a carele&s;s and &s;loven|ly manner&mdash;a play, that was exhibited with|out a &s;ingle new dre&s;s or &s;eene&mdash;a play, that was keptlingering near <HI>&s;even</HI> weeks from its fir&s;t to its third repre&s;entation, and abu&s;ed in the Manager's Paper <HI>before</HI> it made its appear|ance on the &s;tage&mdash;I &s;ay, Gentlemen, I would a&s;k, if it can be fairly &s;uppo&s;ed that a play, which &s;ucceeded under all the&s;e di&s;advanta|ges, could fail of &s;ucce&s;s, when properly ex|hibited?</P>
<P>Suffer me, Gentlemen, to relate one in|&s;tance of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t Dido. The ce|lebrated author of <HI>Tri&s;tram Shandy</HI> was at its fir&s;t repre&s;entation, and, when the cur|tain dropp'd, being a&s;k'd his opinion of the piece, replied in his humourous way, <Q>I &startq;&endq;look upon it as a theatrical Take-in.</Q> The Gentleman, who a&s;k'd the que&s;tion, an&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;I'm &s;urpriz'd to hear this! you &s;eem'd plea|&s;ed &endq;with the repre&s;entation</Q>&mdash;<Q>And was &startq;&endq;truly &s;o,</Q> return'd the Wit: <Q>I only ex|pected &startq;to &s;ee a <HI>mere benefit-play,</HI> and it has turned out one of the be&s;t new tragedies I &endq;ever &s;aw.</Q></P>
<PB N="14" REF="13">
<P>You think, Gentlemen, that Dido cannot be produc'd with advantage to your theatre. Far be it from me to wi&s;h you &s;hould be lo&s;ers by any performance of mine. I think there is a moral certainty, that Dido will have a Run of nine nights. If, therefore, you will produce the receipts of the managers' &s;ix nights, for any new tragedy you have exhi|bited, &s;ince the commencement of your thea|trical reign, I don't de&s;ire to pocket a &s;hilling, till &s;uch &s;um has been received, though you &s;hould agree to get up the piece even in this parliamentary vacation. As parliament does not meet till late in January, depend on't, Gentlemen, you will have great need of no|velty, much novelty, to bring good hou&s;es.</P>
<P>To guard you from every ri&s;k, I beg leave to propo&s;e a new plan. If you will fix a fair price for the u&s;e of your theatre nine nights in November, I &s;hould be glad to con|tract with you. Nay. Gentlemen, I will even extend the number of nights to eighteen, and play Dido and a Comedy alternately. I have other comedies be&s;ides that you have &s;een.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>La&s;t night I re&s;olved to write to my friend, Mr. J&mdash;H&mdash;, who has been long ac|quainted with you, to accompany me to your hou&s;e, as I have a matter of &s;ome con&s;equence to impart to you: however, on farther rumi|nation, it appeared to me more advi&s;eable to open the bu&s;ine&s;s by letter, as the affair might, by that means, be kept the more &s;ecret.&mdash;But to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 23d day of September, I &s;ent to Mr. Linley a tragedy and a comedy, which were returned by Mr. We&s;tley, the trea&s;urer of Drury-lane theatre, with a &s;hort billet, in|forming me the Proprietors were of opinion, that my pieces could not be produc'd with advantage to the theatre.&mdash;As Mr. We&s;tley's letter was dated on the 25th of September, I think it was hardly po&s;&s;ible that both pieces could be read (at lea&s;t be duly and deliberately
<PB N="17" REF="16">read) by <HI>all</HI> the Proprietors. In &s;hort, I can|not help thinking, that both the pieces were &s;o <HI>ha&s;tily</HI> rejected, becau&s;e they have the mi&s;|fortune to be <HI>mine.</HI>&mdash;I impute their rejection <HI>&s;olely</HI> to an unhappy quarrel, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the celebrated Ro&s;cius and me.&mdash;Nay. I am almo&s;t of opinion they were re|turn'd to me <HI>unread.</HI></P>
<P>As to the comedy, I can only &s;ay, it has had the &s;anction of &s;ome acknowledged judges of the drama; and, were it not my own, I would not &s;cruple to a&s;&s;ert, it has equal, if not &s;uperior merit to any of the comic pieces produc'd at Drury-lane, &s;ince the commencement of their proprietor&s;hip; Mr. Sheridan's excepted.</P>
<P>As to the tragedy, viz. Dido, I may, with|out the lea&s;t imputation of vanity, &s;tand up in its defence, becau&s;e it has had the &s;anction of the Public. It was exhibited three nights above &s;eventeen years ago, and received with applau&s;e, in &s;pite of&mdash;I am &s;orry to add&mdash;<HI>Mr. Garrick's &s;ecret influence to cripple it.</HI> From your intimacy with that inimitable Actor, I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e you can|not be a &s;tranger to the cau&s;e of my withdraw|ing Dido the en&s;uing winter.&mdash;Mr. Garrick's
<PB N="18" REF="17">behaviour was &s;uch, that I wrote a pamphlet, with the following title and motto: THEATRICAL DUPLICITY: OR A GENUINE NARRATIVE OF THE CONDUCT of DAVID GARRICK, <ABBR>ESQ</ABBR> TO JOSEPH REED on his Tragedy of DIDO: CONTAINING All the Letters, and &s;everal Conver&s;ations, which pa&s;s'd between the Manager, Author, and Others. on that Subject.</P>

<PB N="19" REF="18">
<P>I read a great part of the narrative to Mr. Holland, who, in a very pre&s;&s;ing manner, di&s;|&s;uaded me from publi&s;hing it. I now repent that I did not publi&s;h it at that time, at lea&s;t not during Mr. Garrick's life, as I am &s;ully per|&s;uaded my dramatic character hath greatly &s;uffer'd, thro' my omi&s;&s;ion of laying before the world, a &s;eries of facts, which bear hard on Mr. Garrick's memory as a Manager. and which not a little affect it as a Man.</P>
<P>On the 30th of September I wrote to the Proprietors, and went to the Trea|&s;urer's office after the play, in expecta|tion of &s;eeing Mr. We&s;tley, who&s;e ab&s;ence induced me to leave the letter with a young man, de&s;iring him to give it to the Trea&s;urer; with a charge to deliver it in the pre&s;ence of <HI>all,</HI> at lea&s;t a majority of the Proprietors. In my letter I dropp'd all defence of the come|dy, but defended Dido in &s;uch a manner, as mu&s;t have procur'd its exhibition, had not there been a &s;trong prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t the play in the ca&s;e. I made the Proprietors two offers; the fir&s;t, to allow them to re|cieve (before I pocketed one &s;hilling) a &s;um equal to the amount of the Managers' &s;ix nights of any new tragedy they had produc'd;
<PB N="20" REF="19">the &s;econd, to hire, at a fair price, their theatre nine nights, for the exhibition of Dido; or eighteen, to play the tragedy, and a comedy alternately; with a propo&s;al of lodging in their hands Government Securities to the amount of the &s;tipulated &s;um&mdash;Both the&s;e offers they have rejected.</P>
<P>I am therefore under the di&s;agreeable ne|ce&s;&s;ity of publi&s;hing the Narrative, to con|vince the literary world, that I am not de&s;ti|tute of abilities to contribute to the entertain|ment of the Public.</P>
<P>You may po&s;&s;ibly think that I have <HI>not</HI> written the pamphlet alluded to, and that I have only made mention of it <HI>in terrorem.</HI> If &s;uch your opinion, I will, whenever de&s;ir'd, read the Narrative to you, or to any per&s;on you &s;hall appoint. I am &s;orry that no other alternative remains; but as I have dramatic pieces by me, which, if play'd with tolerable &s;ucce&s;s, will bring me three thou&s;and pounds, or upwards, my duty, as a father of three chil|dren, (tho' I am in a &s;tate of independency) certainly obliges me to make u&s;e of &s;uch ex|pedient.&mdash;When I publi&s;h the Narrative, I intend to publi&s;h Dido. I am not without
<PB N="21" REF="20">hopes of having permi&s;&s;ion to dedicate the tragedy to a Great Per&s;onage.</P>
<P>You may al&s;o think, that my publication of the Narrative will fail of credit, as Mr. Garrick is no more.&mdash;Don't deceive your|&s;elf in that particular. His very letters (had I not living witne&s;&s;es of his duplicity) would corroborate the facts, I have &s;tated therein. I believe my friend H&mdash;will a&s;&s;ure you, that my veracity is not to be que&s;tion'd. How|ever, to remove every doubt, I &s;hall prefix to the Narrative an affidavit of the truth of its contents: Nay, probably, my late letter to the Proprietors of Drury-lane Theatre.</P>
<P>You may farther think, that an attack on &s;o great a character as Mr. Garrick may make me many literary enemies.&mdash;Even in that ca&s;e, how &s;hall I be a lo&s;er? Mr. Garrick's con|duct hath bla&s;ted my reputation, as a dramatic writer, and the far greater part of my pro|ductions is dramatic.

<P>This letter, on account of its <HI>fal&s;e</HI> critici&s;m, is almo&s;t too contemptible to appear in my Narrative: I have notwith&s;tanding animad|verted on it, as follows.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;I cannot pa&s;s over this letter, without ob&s;erving that Mr. Victor may be equally &s;orry, that the labour of the Authors of Cato, Coriolanus, Julius Cae&s;ar, King Ri|chard the Third, that Earl of E&s;&s;ex, Jane Shore, and &s;everal other tragedies, was not employ'd upon a better &s;tory, as they are
<PB N="27" REF="26">all equally liable to his objection. If we are ever di&s;appointed in the Event (which this &s;uperficial cri$$e. <HI>impertinently</HI> tells a No|bleman, is call'd the <HI>Cata&s;trophe</HI>) of a tra|gedy, it is when the piece $word$ happily; for we as naturally expect <HI>Death</HI> to be the Event of tragedy, as we do <HI>Marriage</HI> to be &endq;the Event of comedy.</Q></P>
<P>Tho' Mr. Victor was not a little $allied on account of the above letter, he tenaci|ou&s;ly adher'd to his opinion, and even after three audiences had given the $word$ to his <HI>in&s;urmountable</HI> objection, this pseudo critic, with a truly-pedantic ob&s;tinacy, ju&s;tifies his opinion in his hi&s;tory of the Stage, and endeavours to depreciate Dido, to gratify his own &s;pleen, or in hopes of plea&s;ing Mr. Garrick, to whom he was $word$ I may u&s;e the $word$. pre&s;&s;ion) indebted for his daily bread<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Victor was, at that time, Trea&s;ures to Drury lane Theatre.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As the Gentleman. who read Dido, has not particulariz'd his objections, it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to refute them. It cannot be $word$ that Dido was received with applau&s;e: and, &s;ince its exhibition, I can truly a&s;&s;ert that the
<PB N="28" REF="27">manu&s;cript has been read by, at lea&s;t, fifty Gentlemen of literary abilities; many of whom have paid me the highe&s;t compliments on its imagery, pathos, and &s;implicity of &s;tyle. I can, therefore, only a&s;&s;ign conjectural rea&s;ons for the cen&s;ure, lately pa&s;s'd on the piece. The Gentleman was, probably, a <HI>warm ad|mirer</HI> of Mr. Garrick: If &s;o, he can hardly be a <HI>friend</HI> to me, on account of my (&s;up|pos'd-blameable) conduct to that inimitable Actor. He may al&s;o be one of the many critics, who prefer a florid high-&s;ounding &s;tyle to a &s;imple one. Dido will, therefore, hardly &s;uit his critical ta&s;te. I hope I may be allow'd to a&s;&s;ert, in defence of my tragedy, that I&s;a|bella, Oroonoko, Jane Shore, and Venice Pre&s;erv'd owe their greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s to &s;impli|ty of diction.&mdash;Every tragic Author, who hopes to <HI>reach the heart,</HI> &s;hould have in view, that admirable precept of <HI>Horace,</HI></P>
<P>Tragicus plerum que dolet <HI>Sermone pede&s;tri.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;aid that many Gentlemen have pa&s;s'd encomiums on Dido. This, you may reply, is mere <HI>ip&s;e dixit,</HI> un&s;upported by proo&s;. I will therefore give you a <HI>public</HI> te&s;|timony, which will overthrow the cen&s;ure of
<PB N="29" REF="28">Mr. Victor, and the Gentleman who has lately read my piece. It is an extract from Biographia Dramatic$, the reputed compilers of which are Mr. <HI>Steevens</HI> and Mr. <HI>Malone,</HI> two ingenious Gentlemen, who about four years ago publi&s;hed an edition of Shake|&s;peare. Their characters, as judges of dra|matic literature, are &s;ufficiently known. I have not the lea&s;t per&s;onal, or epi&s;tolary ac|quaintance with either of them: it cannot therefore be &s;uppos'd, they meant to flatter me by &s;uch extract. I &s;hould not have been able to produce it, if it had not ye&s;terday been given me by a Gentleman, who vi&s;ited me, on a report that Dido had been refus'd by the Drury-lane Managers. The extract runs thus: viz.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Dido.&mdash;Trag. in imitation of Shake|&s;peare's &s;tyle, by Jo&s;eph Reed. Acted at &endq;Drury-lane, 1767. Not printed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;This tragedy was fir&s;t perform'd for the benefit of Mr. Holland, and twice after|wards; when it was each time received with applau&s;e. It was intended to have been reviv'd the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on; but the Author and Manager di&s;agreeing in &s;ome particulars,
<PB N="30" REF="29">the copy was withdrawn, and it has &s;ince lain dormant.&mdash;It would be a poor compliment to the Author, to ob&s;erve that many pieces of inferior merit have been &endq;&s;ince &s;ucce&s;sfully repre&s;ented.</Q></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your letter, tho' dated on Saturday, did not reach me till Tue&s;day night. To be kept in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, till Mr. <HI>Sheridan's</HI> return to town, is a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tance. That Gentleman, if he would have taken the trouble of peru&s;ing Dido, might have put an end to the di&s;pute. His judgment in dramatic compo&s;ition is unque&s;tionable. Tho' he has in his <HI>Critic</HI> &s;o wittily ridicul'd tragedy, I am convinc'd, from his fine feelings, that he would not even wi&s;h to bani&s;h it from the &s;tage. His omi&s;&s;ion of naming a per&s;on to peru&s;e Dido, before he went into the coun|try, has not a favourable appearance; as he can be no &s;tranger to the anxiety, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily attend an Author, while he conti|nues in a &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>From the deci&s;ive opinion, which the inge|nious compilers of Biographia Dramatica have given of Dido. $word$ would &s;carce appeal unna|tural in me, to &s;uppo&s;e the Proprietors have
<PB N="32" REF="31">rejected the tragedy, more on account of <HI>private</HI> di&s;like to the Author, than from a <HI>real</HI> di&s;like of the piece.</P>
<P>As I made no &s;ecret of declaring to many of my friends in the &s;ummer, that I &s;hould offer Dido to the proprietors of Drury-lane theatre this &s;ea&s;on, I am daily teiz'd with the di&s;agreeable &s;alutation, <Q>Can it be true that &startq;&endq;the Managers have rejected Dido?</Q>&mdash;The matter is therefore come to a cri&s;is&mdash;The tragedy mu&s;t either be play'd or publi&s;h'd this &s;ea&s;on, or my dramatic character (re&s;pecting the many pieces I have by me) is entirely bla&s;ted.</P>
<P>I told you I had &s;ome expectations of get|ting my Narrative and Tragedy introduc'd to a GREAT PERSONAGE, and at the &s;ame time inform'd you of the means to effect it. A &s;horter (tho' apparently le&s;s-&s;ucce&s;sful) mode has been pointed out to me, which is my &s;end|ing the tragedy to&mdash;<NOTE N="****" PLACE="foot">A COMMONER of great influence.&mdash;I am now almo&s;t convinc'd, that an application to the right honourable Gentleman would not have &s;uc|ceded. I have, therefore, &s;uppre&s;s'd &s;uch part of the letter, as relates to Him, and the means by which I hop'd to intere&s;t Him in my favour.</NOTE></P>
<PB N="33" REF="32">
<P>As I mentioned an Epitaph, (which in all probability you have not read) I hope you will not think me impertinent in reque&s;t|ing your acceptance of &s;uch literary trifle. It may prove the fugitive entertainment of a few idle minutes, if a Gentleman of your profe&s;|&s;ional engagements may be &s;uppos'd to have any idle ones.</P>
<P>I have a copy of the tragedy. I therefore wi&s;h the piece to remain with you, that it may be ready for a peru&s;al, in ca&s;e the Proprietors &s;hould appoint another per&s;on to read it. However, as the &s;ea&s;on is advancing, I have no time to lo&s;e. It would hardly be prudent in me to remain <HI>unre&s;olv'd</HI> and <HI>unprepar'd</HI> till Mr. <HI>Sheridan's</HI> arrival in town, as his &s;tay in the country may be longer than he ex|pected, and as tran&s;cript of the Narrative and Tragedy will take up no little time. The per&s;on, conditionally engaged for that purpo&s;e, mu&s;t tran&s;cribe it <HI>in my own hou&s;e.</HI> He can only attend occa&s;ionally an hour or two in the evenings: I mu&s;t therefore rea&s;on|ably &s;uppo&s;e, he will not be able to fini&s;h the two pieces in le&s;s than a month.

<PB N="34" REF="33">of hearing the Proprietors' re&s;olution, as you have kindly intimated in your letter, that you will &s;peak to them about the tragedy.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude, without returning you my mo&s;t &s;incere thanks for your endea|vours to &s;erve me&mdash;I al&s;o hope you will generou&s;ly pardon the trouble, I have given you on this occa&s;ion.</P>

<PB N="35" REF="34">
<P>I am advi&s;ed by all, to whom I opened my ca&s;e, to commence literary ho&s;tilities on the Managers of Drury-lane theatre; but as I would yet willingly make them my friends, (and, if I am not extravagantly flatter'd, it will be their intere&s;t to &s;ecure my friend|&s;hip) I &s;hall wait the i&s;&s;ue of Mr. <HI>Sheri|dan's</HI> coming to town.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to &s;ome of my friends beyond a doubt, that the Proprietors are determined to clip my dramatic wings, or they would have &s;often'd their refu&s;al of Dido and the Comedy, by an offer of looking at &s;ome other of my pieces. I could, among my other productions, furni&s;h them with a greater va|riety, than a &s;ingle five-act piece could af|ford. I mean a three act comedy and a mock-tragedy, which I was, a &s;ew years age, advi&s;ed to &s;tart again&s;t Mr. Sheridan's <HI>$word$</HI> However, as the Gentlemen &s;eem to treat me &s;o cavalierly, it would, I pre&s;ume, be in vain to make them &s;uch offer.</P>
<P>Some of my friends have intimated, that if the Proprietor, had been willing to &s;erve $$e, they would have &s;ent the piece to Mrs SID|DONS, as a te&s;t of its merit, adding, if &s;he &s;hould &s;ufficiently &s;ee&s; the part of the heroine,
<PB N="36" REF="35">it is impo&s;&s;ible the play &s;hould fail; e&s;pecially as it would be &s;o &s;trongly &s;upported by the characters of Aeneas, Narbal, and Achates. One Gentleman &s;everely ob&s;erved, that the fate of a late comedy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Piece was damn'd.</NOTE> (to mention no other theatrical mi&s;carriages) was a convincing proof of the <HI>in&s;ufficiency</HI> of the critical abi|lities of the p$$&s;on, appointed for the pe|ru&s;al of pieces tender'd to Drury-lane thea|tre. He even offered to wait on Mr. Linley in behalf of my tragedy, but, as I would not wi&s;h to give offence to that Gentleman, or his Brother-Proprietors, I declined the offer.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, it &s;eems the general opinion of all the Gentlemen whom I have con&s;ulted, that the Proprietors. for &s;ome <HI>private</HI> rea|&s;ons, &s;eem, at all events, determin'd on the non-admi&s;&s;ion of any of my pieces on their &s;tage.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of my friends' advice, I am therefore determin'd to &s;train every nerve to have Dido exhibited, tho' I &s;hould even &s;acrifice the whole profits of the piece to ef|fect it.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould be under the di&s;agreeable ne|ce&s;&s;ity of publi&s;hing my Narrative, I am
<PB N="37" REF="36">advis'd, by way of preparing the Public, to print the letter I &s;ent to the Proprietors.

<P>As Dido has been refus'd, I have certainly a right to know what have been the objec|tions to the piece. Would Mr. Garrick have denied an Author that &s;atisfaction? No: he would (if de&s;ir'd) have pointed out his objec|tions, and endeavoured to have convinc'd him of the improbability of the &s;ucce&s;s of the piece, Why then am I denied &s;uch &s;atisfaction? The tragedy, above &s;eventeen years ago, had the &s;anction of the Public. Is the Public, &s;ince that time, grown more &s;en&s;ible and re|lin'd in tragic ta&s;te?&mdash;I apprehend not&mdash;The town, I may venture to a&s;&s;ert, &s;ince Mr. Gar|rick quitted the &s;tage, has patiently &s;uffered &s;ome tragedies to pa&s;s, which, while he conti|nued Manager, would &s;carce $ ave been

<P>Here ends the epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence; to which I beg leave to add another public te&s;timony of the merits of Dido, given by Mr. Garrick's biographer, Mr. Thomas Davies, who&s;e judgment in dramatic compo&s;ition was indi&s;putable.

<P><Q>&startq;Dido, a tragedy, written by Mr. Reed, a rope maker, was acted for the benefit of Mr. HOLLAND. It was thought an unu&s;ual favour, to give the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> night of a new play to an Actor; nor does the public <HI>know,</HI> why
<PB N="39" REF="38">Dido was <HI>not</HI> play'd <HI>more</HI> than three nights.

<P>If the Regi&s;ter-Office de&s;erve the above character, why have the Managers <HI>&s;uppre&s;s'd</HI> its exhibition?&mdash;As Hamlet &s;ays, <Q>There &startq;is &s;omething in this <HI>more than natural,</HI> if &endq;philo&s;ophy could find it out.</Q></P>
<P>To throw &s;ome &s;mall light on this my&s;tery, I beg leave to inform my readers, that the Regi&s;ter-Office would have been <HI>got up</HI> a &s;ew weeks ago, if its revival had not been un|expectedly <HI>prohibited</HI> without any rea&s;on a&s;|&s;ign'd.

If the revival of the farce has been prevented on &s;uch account, I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily e&s;teem the prohibition a very flattering compliment.</P>
<P>The per&s;on. who was to have tran&s;cribed the Narrative and Tragedy, was detain'd in the country till the middle of December; and three days before his arrival in town the Gentleman, through who&s;e means I hop'd to get the two pieces introduc'd to MAJESTY,

On Mr. Sher$lan's coming to town, I fully expected the promis'd reading would take place; but&mdash;I am quite in the dark for what rea&s;on &s;uch promi&s;e remains to this hour <HI>unfulfilled.</HI></P>
<P>From Mr. Linley's po&s;tponing the &s;econd reading of Dido, may it not be pre&s;urn'd that he was <HI>afraid</HI> &s;uch reading would turn out in favour of the piece? Has not this breach of promi&s;e a &s;trong appearance of re&s;entment. again&s;t me? But in what have I offended him? I can &s;afely decline in nothing, unle&s;s by calling in que&s;tion the abilities, or integri|ty of his Favourite, the <HI>profound</HI> Critic. I am indeed of opinion, that the decline of drama|tic genius, &s;ince Mr. Sheridan quitted the Ma|nagement, and refus'd the in&s;pection of pie|ces offer'd to Drury-lane theatre, may be <HI>fairly</HI> a&s;crib'd to Mr. Linley's want of nece&s;|&s;ary di&s;cernment in dramatic compo&s;ition; but as I never publi&s;h'd my &s;entiments on that occa&s;ion, I cannot have given him any ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence.&mdash;Suffer me to a&s;&s;igna
<PB N="42" REF="41">pre&s;umptive rea&s;on or two, in &s;upport of the above opinion.</P>
<P>As Mr. Linley confe&s;&s;es his own want of judgment in the drama, (a defect &s;carce-pardonable in a Manager) he mu&s;t be ne|ce&s;&s;itated to &s;ubmit the fate of pieces, of|fer'd to the &s;tage, to the deci&s;ion of a per&s;on of known, or pre&s;um'd abilities. But how can he be &s;ure that &s;uch per&s;on (tho' a compe|tent judge) will always act with due impartia|lity? Private friend&s;hip, or private pique to an Author may either bias his judgment, or warp his integrity. That Mr. Linley has been unfortunate in his choice of a dramatic Cen|&s;or is too-evident. Who, or what this Cen&s;or is I don't pretend to know, but it is highly probable that he mu&s;t either be a Per&s;on, who writes for the Stage, or an Actor. If the former, the caution given by our im|mortal Bard is not inapplicable: viz. <Q>Let &startq;&endq;no &s;uch man be tru&s;ted.</Q> His opinion ought not to be deci&s;ive: as he may reject a piece of real merit, through a principle of lite|rary jealou&s;y, or recommend a flim&s;y play, as a foil to his own productions. If the latter, he is equally improper for a Cenfor; for though the piece may contain a part fitted to his theatrical powers, it may al&s;o contain a character, in which another performer would
<PB N="43" REF="42">cut a more capital figure. In &s;uch ca&s;e, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e that he will reject the play.</P>
<P>This was the &s;ailing of our celebrated Ro&s;|cius. Among other piecos, he rejected <HI>Dou|glas,</HI> and <HI>Cleone,</HI> on account of the &s;uperiority of the female characters. Nay, I am almo&s;t convine'd (and in &s;uch opinion I am not &s;in|gular) that he re&s;us'd Dido for a &s;imilar rea|&s;on. He remark'd, that <Q>the play was writ|ten &startq;&endq;for the woman</Q> (Mrs. CIBBER) <Q>and &startq;&endq;that the men</Q>&mdash;I a&s;k pardon for u&s;ing the coar&s;e expre&s;&s;ion&mdash;"were only Sh&mdash;ts&mdash;chs." Yet <HI>Powell, Holland,</HI> and <HI>Ben&s;ley</HI> found no want of applau&s;e in their re&s;pective parts&mdash;Let me ob&s;erve, that Mr. Garrick play'd in <HI>new</HI> pieces, when Dido was fir&s;t offer'd to him. Had he not &s;een the tragedy $word$ his return from <HI>Italy,</HI> it is more than probable that he would not have rejected it.</P>
<P>I waited till the clo&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on, in hope, of hearing from the Manager during the the|atrical vacation. In the beginning of Augu&s;t, I patch'd up this Appeal, and re&s;olv'd to pub|li&s;h it on the very day, announc'd for the opening of Drury-lane theatre, $$ my tragedy was not accepted.</P>
<PB N="44" REF="43">
<P>About a week before the commencement of the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on, I vi&s;ited Mr. Wallis, and told him I had prepared for an attack. He di&s;&s;ua|ded me from publication, by telling me he would, on Mr. Sheridan's coming to town, talk the affair over with him&mdash;I even &s;uf|fer'd the &s;ea&s;on to &s;lip over without any far|ther application, &s;o great is my di&s;like to &s;o|licit favours&mdash;I had &s;eriou&s;ly ruminated on the con&s;equence of my intended publications&mdash;By printing the tragedy, I clearly &s;aw it would become public property, and might be exhibited at any patent theatre, by (what is call'd) <HI>pre&s;criptive right,</HI> by which I &s;hould be depriv'd of the emoluments of repre&s;enta|tion&mdash;This lo&s;s, however, I laid no great &s;tre&s;s on&mdash;I was al&s;o apprehen&s;ive that the tra|gedy would be, with the utmo&s;t &s;everity, at|tack'd by &s;ome hireling literary a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. The <HI>profound</HI> Critic, on who&s;e judgment Mr. Lin|ley &s;o blindly depends, and whom I have rea|&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e my implacable enemy, would doubtle&s;s, in ju&s;tification of his <HI>given</HI> opini|on, make u&s;e of &s;ome expedient pecuniary, or theatrical<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The freedom of the Hou&s;e.</NOTE> to have the reputation of my tragedy decried, or bla&s;ted.</P>
<PB N="45" REF="44">
<P>In &s;uch embarra&s;&s;ing &s;ituation I &s;hew'd the manu&s;cript of this pamphlet to a few Gen|tlemen, on who&s;e judgment and integrity I could rely; but even here I found a contra|riety of opinions. Some &s;trongly advis'd me to &s;end it to the Pre&s;s, by way of prelude to the publication of the Narrative and Tra|gedy, as the affair between Mr. Linley and me was evidently the cau&s;e of the Public. Others di&s;&s;uaded me, as it would probably make the Manager my enemy, and con&s;e|quently more aver&s;e to the reception of any other of my pieces, which might be offer'd to Drury-lane theatre.</P>
<P>I &s;till continued irre&s;olute, in hopes that matters might be accommodated; and, to leave no &s;tone unturn'd for effecting &s;uch pur|po&s;e, I even <HI>conde&s;cended</HI> to reque&s;t the Manager's permi&s;&s;ion that one of the prin|cipal Performers might have Dido for a benefit. This I could do with no other view, than in hopes of <HI>convincing</HI> him, that the tra|gedy had &s;ufficient merit to e&s;tabli&s;h its exi&s;tence as a STOCK-PLAY. To this <HI>hu|miliating</HI> Reque&s;t, (though I did not even de&s;ire either new dre&s;s or &s;cene) I am &s;orry to &s;ay Mr. Linley ab&s;olutely re&s;us'd his
<PB N="46" REF="45">con&s;ent; which is perhaps a greater &s;tretch of theatrical DESPOTISM, than has been exer|cis'd by any Manager during the pre&s;ent century.</P>
<P>How &s;triking the contra&s;t between Mr. Linley's CRUELTY to me, and his PARTI|ALITY to another Dramati&s;t! It would almo&s;t puzzle an able Ca&s;ui&s;t to decide in which par|ticular the Manager's conduct merits the &s;e|verer reprehen&s;ion&mdash;Two years ago, a tra|gedy and a comedy (each of five acts writ|ten by the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Author) were brought our at Drury-lane theatre&mdash;Did Mr. Garrick, though a known dupe to flattery, ever grant a &s;imilar indulgence to any of his dramatic Sycophants? Never. He knew that &s;uch unwarrantable preference would be look'd upon as an opening to a monopoly of &s;tage emoluments, by which genius would be di&s;|courag'd, and an act of inju&s;tice to Authors, the repre&s;entation of who&s;e pieces would be thereby procra&s;tinated&mdash;The <HI>true</HI> mo|tive of Mr. Linley's partiality to this Gentle. man is not publicly known, though many &s;hrewed remarks were made on it, little to the credit of either Author or Manager.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="46">
<P>Notwith&s;tanding Mr. Linley's unju&s;tifia|ble refu&s;al of the above reque&s;t, I &s;hould po&s;&s;ibly &s;till have he&s;itated in re&s;pect of publication, if a Gentleman of his acquain|tance had not lately hinted to one of my friends, that Dido would not be accepted at Drury-lane theatre, on account of my quarrel with Mr. Garrick. My Friend indeed a&s;cribes this piece of unparallelled inju&s;tice to the <HI>pro|found</HI> Critic's influence over Mr. Linley. In either ca&s;e, I can hardly &s;uppo&s;e, after the Manager's ob&s;tinate per&s;everance in refu&s;ing the tragedy, that any real Well-wither to dra|matic genius, and the cau&s;e of literary liberty will blame me for publication.</P>
<P>I might here clo&s;e my APPEAL, in <HI>full a&s;&s;u|rance</HI> that every impartial reader will ima|gine, I have been treated with unprece|dented cruelty in the ARBITRARY REJEC|TION of my tragedy, to &s;ay nothing of the comedy. To convince the world that I do not a&s;&s;ert this through the u&s;ual partiality of the Poet, I beg leave to produce a CON|CLUSIVE AUTHORITY from a great dramatic Genius and able Manager.</P>
