<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>My</HI> LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF I could have the Vanity to make a Merit of Dedicating this Tragedy to Your Lord&s;hip, I &s;hould here take an Opportunity of telling Your Lord&s;hip, that I am, in This, endeavouring to make the be&s;t, and only Return I am capable of, for all tho&s;e Marks of exceeding Goodne&s;s and Humanity, which I have
<PB REF="4">
&s;till had the Honour to meet with from Your Lord|&s;hip. But &s;ince the Matter is quite otherwi&s;e, &s;ince it is highly to my Advantage to Shelter my &s;elf under &s;o great a Name; &s;ince I have done my &s;elf &s;o much Ho|nour by it; I am bound to own, with all the Gratitude I am capable of, that Your Lord&s;hip's Patronage is a New, and will be a La&s;ting Obligation upon me.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t kinds of Poetry, but e&s;pecially Tragedies, come into the World now, like Children born under ill Stars&punc; a general Indifference, or rather Di&s;inclination, attends like a bad Influence upon 'em; and after having bu&s;tled thro' ill U&s;age, and a &s;hort Life, they &s;leep and are forgotten. The Reli&s;h of Things of this kind is certain|ly very much alter'd from what it was &s;ome time &s;ince; and tho' I won't pre&s;ume to Cen&s;ure other Peoples Plea&s;ures, and pre&s;cribe to the various Ta&s;tes of Man|kind; yet I will take the Liberty to &s;ay, that tho&s;e who &s;corn to be entertain'd like their Fore-fathers, will hard|ly &s;ub&s;titute &s;o rea&s;onable a Diver&s;ion in the Room of that which they have laid a&s;ide. I could wi&s;h there were not &s;o much Rea&s;on as there is to attribute this Change of Inclinations, to a Di&s;e&s;teem of Learning it &s;elf. Too many People are apt to think that Books are not Nece&s;&s;ary to the Fini&s;hing the Character of a fine Gentleman; and are therefore ea&s;ily drawn to de&s;pi&s;e what they know nothing of. But, my Lord, among all the&s;e mortifying Thoughts, it is &s;till a Plea&s;ure to the Mu&s;es, to think there are &s;ome Men of too delicate Under&s;tandings to give in to the Ta&s;tes of a deprav'd Age; Men that have not only the Power, but the Will, to protect tho&s;e Arts which they love, becau&s;e they are Ma&s;ters of 'em.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">It would be very ea&s;ie for me to di&s;tingui&s;h one a|mong tho&s;e few, after the mo&s;t advantageous Manner; but all Men of common Sen&s;e have concurr'd in doing it already, and there is no need of a Panegyrick.</P>
<P>I could be almo&s;t tempted to Expo&s;tulate with the re&s;t of the World, (for I am &s;ure there is no Occa&s;ion to make an Apology to Your Lord&s;hip) in Defence of Poetry. I am far from thinking of a good Poet, as the <HI>Stoicks</HI> did of their Wi&s;e-man, that he was &s;uffici|ent for every thing, could be every thing, and excel in every thing, as he pleas'd; yet &s;ure I may be allow'd to &s;ay, that, that Brightne&s;s, Quickne&s;s, that Strength and Greatne&s;s of thinking, which is requir'd in any of the nobler Kinds of Poetry, would rai&s;e a Man to an uncommon Di&s;tinction in any Profe&s;&s;ion or Bu&s;ine&s;s, that has a Relation to good Sen&s;e and Under&s;tanding. One Modern In&s;tance can at lea&s;t be given, where the &s;ame Genius that &s;hone in Poetry, was found equal to the fir&s;t Employments of the State; and where the &s;ame Man, who by his Virtue and Wi&s;dom was highly U&s;e|ful to, and In&s;trumental in the Safety and Happine&s;s of his Native Country, had been equally Ornamental to it in his Wit.</P>
<P>This is what I could not help &s;aying, for the Honour of an Art which has been formerly the Favourite of the greate&s;t Men. Not that it wants a Recommendation to Your Lord&s;hip, who have always been a Con&s;tant and Generous Protector of it. This indeed would be much more properly &s;aid to the World; and when I have told 'em what Men have equally adorn'd it, and been adorn'd
<PB REF="6">
by it. I might not unfitly apply to 'em, what <HI>Horace</HI> &s;aid to the <HI>Pi&s;o</HI>'s;
<Q><L>&mdash;Ne fort&egrave; Pudori</L>
<L>Sit tibi Mu&s;a Lyrae &s;olers &amp; Cantor Apollo:</L></Q></P>
<P>For my own incon&s;iderable Preten&s;ions to Ver&s;e, I &s;hall, I confe&s;s, think better even of them, than I have ever yet done, if they &s;hall afford me the Honour to be always thought,</P>

<L>But now they &s;tray; and in this populous Town</L>

<L>As to your Drinking&mdash;but for that we &s;pare it,</L>

<L>Among&s;t your many Plea&s;ures finds no Place;</L>
<L>The virtuous Laws of common Sen&s;e for &s;wearing,</L>

<L>THE Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Day being now gone thro'</L>

<L>What think you of the Matter? Which of you</L>
<L>Would, for his Spou&s;e, like my true Turtle do?</L>
<L>When Wealth and Beauty both at once importune,</L>
<L>Who would not leave his Wife, to make his Fortune?</L>
<L>To &s;ome, I know, it may appear but odly,</L>
<L>That this Place, of all others, &s;hould turn godly:</L>
<L>But what of that? Since &s;ome good Souls there are,</L>
<L>Would gladly be in&s;tructed any where;</L>
<L>Nor &s;hould you &s;corn the Weakne&s;s of the Teacher,</L>

<L>You'll be but little better for our Story.</L>
<L>But &s;ince the parting Hour, tho' late, will come,</L>
<L>And all of you, at lea&s;t as I pre&s;ume,</L>
<L>May find &s;ome kind, in&s;tructive She at home,</L>
<L>Then Curtain Lectures will, I hope, be read,</L>
