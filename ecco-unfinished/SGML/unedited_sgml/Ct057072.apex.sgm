<HEAD>Some National Grievances re|pre&s;ented, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AS Gentlemen in &s;uch high Stations as yours, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be ac|quainted with the Complaints and Grumblings of tho&s;e of the lower Forms of Life, but by the Information of others; and lea&s;t you &s;hould not be &s;en&s;ible of the pre&s;ent Com|plaints
<PB N="2" REF="3">
of the Nation, and that you may be left without Excu&s;e, if all our rea&s;onable Grievances are not redre&s;s'd, I have taken upon me, in this publick and plain Manner, to make them known to you. I &s;hall pretend to no Rhetorical Flouri&s;hes, nor Sophi&s;try, but &s;hall &s;et down, as near as po&s;&s;ible, the very Words of the Complainants: It may be asked why the&s;e Mat|ters &s;hould be directed to you, more than to any other great Man: I &s;hall an&s;wer, that as you are the Per&s;on mo&s;t rail'd at, and abu&s;ed by the Grumbleto|nians at the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tra|tion; &s;o they and all others look upon you, as mo&s;t capable to get them Redre&s;s: Now, as to my own Part, I have no End
<PB N="3" REF="4">
in writing this, but that of all <HI>Authors,</HI> (viz.) the Good of my Country; therefore &s;ince what I do, is to &s;o good an End only, and not at all with any evil De|&s;ign, either to reflect on the pre|&s;ent Mini&s;try, or &s;ow Sedition among&s;t His Maje&s;ties Subjects, nor any Per&s;onal Intere&s;t: I do lay down as a Preliminary Ar|ticle, that you &s;hall not let me &s;uffer any Tribulation, nor be confin'd from whol&s;ome Air, for any Thing I &s;hall mention in this my plain Way: This being agreed upon, I &s;hall begin with the fir&s;t and greate&s;t Grievance, and in which, mo&s;t Men think them&s;elves aggrieved, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the unequal Di&s;tribution of Court Places: You cannot imagine, Sir, how many Men of great Merit are grumbling up and down this
<PB N="4" REF="5">
great City, to &s;ee &s;o many pre|ferr'd, and them&s;elves neglected; &s;ome that have always voted for the Whigs, others that have al|ways baul'd, and been noi&s;y for them, and others that have &s;i|lently wi&s;hed them Succe&s;s: The&s;e all now make loud Pre|tences, but above all, there are &s;everal Gentlemen of the Quill, that call them&s;elves Authors, and with who&s;e Ca&s;e I am more particularly affected, that find them&s;elves wholly neglected, and who you ought of all others to provide for, lea&s;t they &s;hould turn the bitter Edge of their Tools again&s;t you, and the re&s;t of the Mini&s;try, and then alas for you! take what follows. There's Mr. <HI>John Dunton</HI> has be|gun to thunder again&s;t you al|ready, every Body knows, how
<PB N="5" REF="6">
&s;erviceable he was to the Nation, in blowing up and di&s;covering the wicked and villainous De&s;igns of the late Mini&s;try, which he found out within &s;ix Months after every Body be&s;ides knew them: He had certainly been pu|ni&s;hed by that Mini&s;try, had he not been allowed of all Hands to be mad, tho' it is really hard he is not provided for; but I will not blame you, becau&s;e I am not &s;ure <HI>Morefields</HI> Preferments are in your Gift. The next is, Mr. <HI>A. B</HI>&mdash;, a Gentleman of very quick Parts. I can tell you, Sir, of my own Knowledge, he is not plea&s;ed with you; he has large Pretences, having for five Years la&s;t pa&s;t, with prodigious Indu&s;try, labour'd for the Good of his Country, and his own ve|ry great Profit, in publi&s;hing
<PB N="6" REF="7">
Monthly Political Ob&s;ervations on the State of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> give me leave to tell you, this Mercurial Gentleman, did not expect to be at the Trouble of asking for a Place under a Whig Mini&s;try, and took it in &s;o much Dudgeon to find Mr. <HI>S&mdash;B</HI>&mdash;&s;o well provided for in the very Po&s;t he expected him&s;elf, that he made a ra&s;h Re&s;olve, not to be oblig'd to any of you for a Place; and the better to pro|vide for him&s;elf, did turn the be&s;t Room in his Hou&s;e into a Shop, and &s;old his own Books; but I believe he is &s;ick of the Trade, and it's po&s;&s;ible it may not be too late yet, to make him yours. The next I &s;hall mention, is the Author of the Flying Po&s;t; it is much wondered he is not di&s;tingui&s;h'd: It was
<PB N="7" REF="8">
reported, he was made fir&s;t Cook in his M&mdash;s Kitchin, but I never believed it, and am well informed it is not &s;o. There are &s;everal others that writ in the Whig Cau&s;e in the Time of the Popi&s;h Mini&s;try, and had their Expectations, but their Works were never much read; &s;o I &s;hall pa&s;s them over, and leave to your Judgment, whether the worthy Gentlemen mention|ed, are worth retaining or not: There is one Complaint, which, if true, carries &s;ome Weight with it, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that there are &s;everal Per&s;ons &s;till in Places, under his Maje&s;ty, that are no great Friends to his Government; but the Blame of this is laid upon the Old Corporal; for my Part, I blame no Body, but pray for a thorough Reformation. I &s;hall
<PB N="8" REF="9">
dwell no longer upon this Head, but conclude it with this Ob&s;ervation, that every Body out of Place think they have more Merit, than tho&s;e that are in; and very few are willing to &s;erve their Country for nought.</P>

<P>The Gentlemen Authors a|bovementioned, bid me tell you, they &s;hould not have re|&s;ented their not being preferr'd &s;o much, if <HI>S. R&mdash;S&mdash;l,</HI> Mr. <HI>A&mdash;n,</HI> Mr. <HI>H.

<HEAD>Of a Standing Army.</HEAD>
<P>THE Keeping up the Ar|my, is a Topick much talked of among&s;t the Tories. They &s;ay, a Standing Army in <HI>England,</HI> has been always ac|counted dangerous, and what makes our Liberties very pre|carious: They &s;ay it is keeping a Bridle in the Peoples Mouths, that the Prince may ride them at Plea&s;ure, and that it is a great Charge to the Nation; and all that they can po&s;&s;ibly get by it, is Slavery: That there is now le&s;s Occa&s;ion for it than ever, becau&s;e we are at perfect Peace with all the World, and that there is no Pro&s;pect of a new War: Nay, they &s;ay the Whigs them&s;elves have always
<PB N="10" REF="11">
profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves Enemies to a Standing Army, and won|der they &s;hould be &s;o zealous for it now, when it is &s;o allow|edly again&s;t the Intere&s;t of the Nation; and it is mo&s;t certain, that the&s;e Gentlemen have great Rea&s;on for what they &s;ay; for the Intere&s;t of the Nation, upon the Schemes they have &s;ettled it, is certainly in Danger, nay and ruined, unle&s;s the Army, which is a Terrour to his Maje&s;ties Enemies, be disbanded: for as Matters are now managed, a poor harmle&s;s Fellow cannot abu&s;e the King, or any of the Royal Family, but pre&s;ently &s;ome &s;aucy Red Coat knocks him down, or hales him to Ju&s;tice: nay, there has been Complaints from &s;everal Parts of the Kingdom, be&s;ides <HI>Oxford,</HI> again&s;t the In&s;o|lence
<PB N="11" REF="12">
of the Soldiers, for beat|ing and abu&s;ing &s;everal well|meaning People, only for talking and acting as much Trea&s;on, as would have hanged them in the pious Times of <HI>Jacobus Se|cundus;</HI> and not only that, but the Tories without Doors are apt to believe, if the&s;e queer Fellows were disbanded, and di&s;per&s;ed, &s;everal worthy Patri|ots of the CHURCH PAR|TY, would very piou&s;ly and courageou&s;ly de&s;pi&s;e the Septen|nial Act, and refu&s;e to &s;it in the Hou&s;e, after the Expiration of the Triennial, unle&s;s new cho&s;en; but they will not an|&s;wer for their Courage, if the&s;e tremendous Gentlemen are kept together; and is it not a great Pity, that &s;uch worthy Patriots, &s;uch zealous Friends to their
<PB N="12" REF="13">
Country &s;hould be awed, and forced to obey the Laws of the Land, and e&s;pecially &s;uch as they had a Hand in the making of them&s;elves; be&s;ides, tho' their Hopes of &s;erving the Pre|tender are &s;unk very low, yet they think they have Intere&s;t enough among the Mob, if the Army were disbanded, to cau&s;e Riots, and make Di&s;turbances enough to occa&s;ion a Change in the Mini&s;try, which they mo&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;ire, though a new Set of Men of the &s;ame Principles came in their Places; they would be glad to compound that Way, to be revenged of tho&s;e Men, who have &s;o effectually ruined their Cau&s;e, and &s;ome of them are &s;anguine enough to believe there will be a Change in two Years at mo&s;t; Now I
<PB N="13" REF="14">
do not doubt but your &s;elf, and mo&s;t of the pre&s;ent Mini|&s;try, are good Patriots enough to u&s;e your utmo&s;t Intere&s;t in Parliament, to get the Army disbanded, and that &s;peedily, e&s;pecially when you con&s;ider, if it &s;hould be kept up two Years more, in all Likelyhood, the&s;e good CHURCH Men would never be able to ruin the Nation: They depend upon your utmo&s;t Diligence in this Affair, becau&s;e you are their chief Favourite.</P>

<PB N="14" REF="15">
<HEAD>Septennial Act.</HEAD>
<P>THE Septennial Act the Tories declaim again&s;t mo&s;t bitterly, as contrary to all Ju&s;tice; it was what they could never have &s;u&s;pected, it has made the religious Cau&s;e of Po|pery and Jacobiti&s;m utterly ir|retrievable: Was ever any thing &s;o mon&s;trous, as to make &s;uch Laws to oppre&s;s poor People that were almo&s;t undone be|fore? What Chance had they after the Rebels were beaten, de&s;troyed, impri&s;oned, and hang|ed? I &s;ay, what Chance could the poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Pro&s;titutes of Arbitrary Power have, ever to make any Figure again, but the Hopes of continuing and increa|&s;ing the Poy&s;on, they hadbefore
<PB N="15" REF="16">
&s;pread over the Nation, in Or|der to make good their Inte|re&s;t again&s;t the next Election? What Pains did they not take to rai&s;e Compa&s;&s;ion in the Brea&s;ts of the People, for the poor unfortunate Gentlemen, as they call the Re|bels: and to be &s;ure, would have &s;pared no Co&s;t to have attain'd their Ends; for con&s;ider|ing how many ventured Life and E&s;tate in the Service of the Cau&s;e, and how many more we are &s;ure were ready to do it upon the lea&s;t Encouragement, it is out of the Di&s;pute, whether they would have &s;pent half their E&s;tates to have gained a Parliament to their Mind: Nay, they were &s;o &s;ure, that they be|gan to adjourn their further En|deavours to &s;erve their Ma&s;ter the Pretender till that Time, as
<PB N="16" REF="17">
not doubting but they &s;hould then have an Opportunity to do it effectually: Therefore &s;ince Things are thus, it is hoped they may be allowed to com|plain, they have nothing el&s;e left for it, this was their great and potent Cordial; &s;o if you are not re&s;olved wholly to pre|vent them from ruining or di&s;turbing the Nation, and ut|terly to cru&s;h that Party that has for &s;o many Years been undermining the Liberties of the People, you mu&s;t get this Act repealed; they will be very much obliged to you: If you will do them this &s;mall Piece of Service, it will ea&s;e them in all Circum&s;tances of Life: They cannot hear it named with|out grinning, it makes them bite their Nails, &s;tamp, and
<PB N="17" REF="18">
what not: So pray Sir, if you have any Chri&s;tian Charity, con|&s;ider what Set of Men this Act is a Grievance too, and relieve them as they de&s;erve.</P>

<HEAD>&V;nmercifulne&s;s to State Criminals.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING has made a greater, or more exten|&s;ive Bu&s;tle, than this Complaint of the Inclemency of the pre&s;ent Government towards State Of|fenders: and in Truth, no Man can well &s;ay it is altoge|ther groundle&s;s; for let us but con&s;ider a little, and we mu&s;t allow, that if at the fir&s;t, the Tories of all Sorrs, both Male and Female, had been u&s;ed with &s;everer Di&s;cipline, it had kept them in more Awe; and &s;everal pre&s;uming too much upon the great Clemency of the Govern|ment, towards Per&s;ons convict|ed of Riots, reviling of the be&s;t of Kings, and in&s;ulting and a|bu&s;ing
<PB N="19" REF="20">
his Mini&s;try: I &s;ay, ma|ny pre&s;uming too much upon this, have fallen into the &s;ame villanous Practice, (which more Severity might have prevented) whereby they have ruined them|&s;elves and Families; and in this, and this Sen&s;e only, can I con|ceive any Room to accu&s;e his Maje&s;ty or his Mini&s;try of Seve|rity. I am &s;ure they can have no Rea&s;on to complain on this Head, in Relation to the Re|bels; if they will plea&s;e to con|&s;ider in what manner they were taken, and that if they had eve|ry Man been killed upon the Spot, it was what they ought to have expected in their Circum|&s;tances, and what no body could have ju&s;tly found Fault with; but we will leave the&s;e Men to their pre&s;ent Circum|&s;tances,
<PB N="20" REF="21">
and only ask our Tory Brethren, whether they can &s;ay, they have been hardly dealt with, when they recollect, the many &s;candalous, trea&s;onable, and vil|lanous Reflections they have daily ca&s;t on the King, and the Royal Family; there are few of them in their private Capacities, but would have re&s;ented the U&s;age they have given their So|vereign in a more rigid Manner than he has done: And the Tory Ladies, (even from tho&s;e of the be&s;t Fa&s;hion, to the <HI>Ro&s;e|mary-Lane</HI> Bunters,) have been very notorious in this Particular, and many of them continue the &s;ame &s;till: The whole Conver&s;a|tion of their Tea-Tables has been Lies, Raillings, and <HI>Billin&s;|gate,</HI> too filthy, &s;illy, and &s;can|dalous to repeat: They have giv|en
<PB N="21" REF="22">
up the common Mode&s;ty of their Sex, and by turning Poli|ticians, have &s;o &s;ower'd their Brows, that they have dive&s;ted them&s;elves of that Softne&s;s that charms Mankind. It has been no uncommon Thing to &s;ee a fine Lady &s;traddle, frown, and &s;tare you in the Face, like a Grenadier: nay, mo&s;t of them, with the Addition of a Pair of Whiskers, would make tolera|ble Saracens: how many are daily guilty of Petty Trea&s;on, in drinking Healths to the at|tainted Enemies of their Coun|try, and Pro&s;perity in too plain Terms to their Popi&s;h Idol; and how few are, or have been puni&s;hed for it. Should a Man &s;ay, my Lady <HI>Betty</HI>&mdash;has a Pimple on her Bum, no|thing le&s;s than a Stab would

attone for the Offence: but the Ladies may &s;ay what they plea&s;e of <HI>Her Royal Highne&s;s,</HI> without Breach of their new fa|&s;hion'd Mode&s;ty, or good Man|ners: great Unmercifulne&s;s, per|&s;ecuting Mini&s;try, that will not &s;uffer the&s;e poor People, either Quality or Mob, to &s;peak Trea|&s;on, nor revile the Royal Family, without Danger, nay, tho' they are true <HI>Church</HI> Folks; bad Times! bad Times!</P>

<HEAD>Of the Clergy.</HEAD>
<P>AS my Way in my Plea&s;ures is to begin, and end the Day with tho&s;e I like be&s;t; &s;o in the&s;e my Complaints, I will take the &s;ame Method: The greate&s;t Grievance in Life is, to be hurt in our worldly Intere&s;t, and next to that, we are for taking Care of our Souls, I only &s;peak as the World acts; for I find the fir&s;t Endeavours of Mankind is, to get Wealth and Preferment, (which they call Honour,) that they may in|dulge them&s;elves, and live mer|rily in this Life, and they are al&s;o very willing, when they come to die, to get a &s;ure Pa&s;s to Hea|ven; and therefore I think we ought to have a great Regard
<PB N="24" REF="25">
for the Clergy, e&s;pecially if, as they tell us, our Pa&s;s won't do, unle&s;s they &s;ign it: Now at this Time, it is &s;aid by tho&s;e that call them&s;elves good Churchmen, that a great many Orthodox Divines are neglected and ill u&s;ed for very &s;mall Matters, only becau&s;e their Con&s;ciences are not true Wa&s;h Leather: In|deed they were pretty comply|ing, they ea&s;ily &s;tretched to for|mer Oaths, among&s;t the re&s;t that of the Abjuration: but now Oaths to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty are tendred, they &s;hrink from the Size of a Canonical Hat, to that of a Face patch, and are won|derful &s;tiff and unpliant: It is well known, that mo&s;t of the&s;e Gentlemen are merry, hone&s;t, jovial Fellows, and drink the Church as heartily as any of the
<PB N="25" REF="26">
Bi&s;hops can do, Ay and to the <HI>BEST in Chri&s;tendom</HI> too, I know it to be true: And is it not a Shame, &s;uch Chri&s;tians &s;hould be de|prived of their Livings, becau&s;e they are Enemies to the Govern|ment? Nay, they are not &s;uch great Enemies as &s;ome imagine neither; for they would &s;wear to King <HI>George,</HI> though they hate him, provided he would change the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, and take in Tories. The Whigs have been always looked upon by the&s;e Orthodox Saints as Enemies to the Church: and is it without Rea&s;on, when it is &s;o well known, that they have always violently oppo&s;ed the Church's being independent of the State, and have the Impudence to maintain, according to the Can|nons, that the King is the
<PB N="26" REF="27">
Head of it: I will be Judge by my Good <HI>L&mdash;B</HI>&mdash;of <HI>R</HI>&mdash;, and the Dean of <HI>St. Patrick,</HI> if this is not Athei&s;m, Dei&s;m, Sociniani&s;m, Free-think|ing, Presbyteriani&s;m, Whoring, Drinking, and every Thing that is bad: I am &s;ure, I have known &s;everal hone&s;t Whigs, that go con&s;tantly to Church, graced with the abovementioned Epi|thets; and I could never learn any other Rea&s;on for it, than that they were violently again&s;t Prie&s;tcraft, and the Dominion of the&s;e Saints here upon Earth: I mu&s;t beg of you, Sir, to con&s;ider with your &s;elf, whether it is not more for the Intere&s;t of your Country, to get the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try chang'd, than to let the Church lo&s;e &s;uch a Set of <HI>Lights:</HI> con&s;ider their Noble,
<PB N="27" REF="28">
florid Looks, their double Chins, their Glorious Ruby Faces, which will certainly fade and grow languid, if they are not re-e&s;tabli&s;h'd: If you do not take Care of them, their Iron Con|&s;ciences, which formerly could batter down any Thing, will be turn'd into Lead, and be melted by their Afflictions. I am afraid the <HI>Holbourn</HI> Doctor, &amp;c. will &s;oon grow weary of &s;up|porting them, and then, alas! what Remedy have they, but to repent, grow Religious, and take anew tho&s;e Oaths, which they have in Effect taken &s;everal Years &s;ince: Con&s;ider, Sir, the &s;eparate Congregations they have got together can be but a &s;mall Sub&s;i&s;tance, being made up of Butchers, Herb-Women, and Apprentice Boys, and Per&s;ons
<PB N="28" REF="29">
of the meaner Sort of tho&s;e Clans: I am certainly inform'd, that a Tavern Boy, and a Jour|neyman Taylor, are Church|wardens to two of them: Indeed they may fitly enough compare them&s;elves to the Primitive Times by the Meanne&s;s of their Followers, but it would be better for them if they could as truly do it by the Simplicity of their Lives: O! did you but know, how the mock Daughters of <HI>Sion</HI> bewail, and lament the Downfal of the&s;e &s;ham Mar|tyrs: not a Dram of <HI>Geneva,</HI> but belches out a Cur&s;e again&s;t the Whig Mini&s;try, for reducing &s;o many &s;turdy, able bodied Men: it ought to be con&s;ider|ed al&s;o, that the depriving the Church of &s;o many Men, who no Body pretends to charge
<PB N="29" REF="30">
with having either Morals, Re|ligion, or Hone&s;ty, gives our Enemies a great Advantage in &s;preading their Clamours of the pre&s;ent Dangers of the Church: and with good Rea&s;on too, for if you turn out &s;uch wicked Men, who do you think will come to the Church: a great Plea&s;ure indeed to any one to hear an Hone&s;t Pious Man always telling him of his Faults, and reminding him of his Duty to God and the King: Who can bear to be di|&s;turbed in their <HI>CHRISTIAN LIBERTIES:</HI> It is well known, the Jovial Crew lately turn'd out for refu&s;ing Oaths, that did not plea&s;e their Con&s;ciences, never did it: and if a Man was hone&s;t, that is, would drink and &s;wear for the Church, he was al|lowed to have the Root of the
<PB N="30" REF="31">
Matter in him, and ea&s;ily got a &s;afe Pa&s;s: &s;o that upon the whole, you are humbly de&s;ired, and that with good Rea&s;on, by all Papi&s;ts, Jacobites, Whores, Bawds, &amp;c. to do your be&s;t to get the&s;e Men preferr'd: they de&s;ire, if po&s;&s;ible, you would do it with|out tendring them the Oaths.</P>
