<HEAD>TO
JOHN *****, E&s;&abque;</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>Feb. 21. 1749.</DATE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have my &s;incere&s;t Thanks
for the kind Information you
&s;ent me of the generous Scheme
that is form'd for the Printing Mrs. LEA|POR'S
remaining Papers, for the Benefit of
her Father; and that the ingenious Gen|tlemen
you mention, intend to give &s;ome
Account of the Author: For nothing can
give me more Plea&s;ure than to hear of a
De&s;ign that may do Honour to her Me|mory,
and be of Service to Him for whom
&s;he always expre&s;&s;ed a mo&s;t affectionate
and dutiful Regard, particularly in her la&s;t
Moments.</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="16">
I &s;hall readily contribute any thing in
my Power, tho' I fear that is very little:
But, upon making a thorough Search
among my Papers, I have found Two or
Three of hers, that were mi&s;laid when the
other were &s;ent to Mrs. <HI>J</HI>&mdash;; which I here
&s;end you, with two or three Copies wrote
in her Childhood, that have &s;ince been
alter'd as they now &s;tand in the printed
Book.</P>
<P>Several of tho&s;e &s;ent to Mrs. <HI>J</HI>&mdash;were
likewi&s;e wrote when &s;he was very young;
and were condemn'd to the Flames by
her&s;elf, but &s;pared at my Interce&s;&s;ion; &s;o
that I am very dubious, whether they will
be thought worth printing or not; though I
mu&s;t own my&s;elf fond of every thing that
was hers.</P>
<P>I remember I &s;aw, two or three Years be|fore
my Acquaintance with her commenced,
a Book about the Size of a common Copy-Book
(but &s;omething thicker) fill'd with
Poems of her writing, that much pleas'd
me. I thought them extraordinary Per|formances
for a Girl of her Age, and one
<PB N="xix" REF="17">
that had &s;o little Advantage (or rather
none at all) either from Books or Con|ver&s;ation:
But my bad State of Health
prevented me from making any further
Enquiry concerning this young Genius, till
about fourteen Months before her Death,
when I was inform'd &s;he had wrote a
Tragedy.</P>
<P>I could not help &s;miling at this; think|ing
it at lea&s;t a very bold Attempt from a
Per&s;on in her Situation. But however, it
rai&s;ed my Curio&s;ity very much: And hap|pening
to meet with her a Day or two
afterwards, I begg'd the Favour of &s;eeing
it; which was readily granted. You may
ea&s;ily gue&s;s how far it exceeded my Ex|pectation.</P>
<P>Soon after I made her a Vi&s;it; and
expre&s;&s;ing how much I lik'd the Play, de|&s;ir'd
&s;he would give me Leave to &s;ee any
thing el&s;e &s;he might have wrote; upon
which &s;he brought a little Box, where
her Papers lay in a carele&s;s confus'd man|ner,
and allow'd me to look them all over;
which I did with a great deal of Plea&s;ure,
and no &s;mall A&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="xx" REF="18">
I then enquired for the little Book I
had &s;een before; but &s;he told me &s;he had
burnt it long ago, with &s;everal other Pa|pers,
which &s;he did not think worth pre|&s;erving.</P>
<P>This I could not help blaming her for,
as there were a great many pretty Things
in it; particularly a Poem, relating the
Hi&s;tory of <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Court&s;hip and Marriage
of <HI>Rebecca;</HI> which has &s;ince been much
enquir'd for by &s;ome that had &s;een it.</P>
<P>My mentioning a Sub&s;cription, I believe,
occa&s;ioned her Poem, call'd <HI>Mop&s;us,</HI> or,
<HI>The Ca&s;tle-Builder;</HI> and I indulg'd my
Curio&s;ity in calling upon her often, to &s;ee
how &s;he carried it on. It was really amaze|ing
to &s;ee how fa&s;t &s;he advanc'd in it; her
Thoughts &s;eeming to flow as fa&s;t as &s;he
could put them upon Paper; and I am per|&s;uaded,
that many beautiful ones have been
lo&s;t for want of Lei&s;ure to write them.</P>
<P>My expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome Fear of being trou|ble&s;ome
in coming &s;o frequently, occa|&s;ioned
a great Variety of Invitations, both
<PB N="xxi" REF="19">
in Ver&s;e and Pro&s;e; which I could &s;eldom
re&s;i&s;t: And indeed her whole Behaviour
to me was &s;o extremely good-natur'd and
obliging, that I mu&s;t have been the mo&s;t
ungrateful Per&s;on in the World, if I had
not endeavour'd to make &s;ome Return.</P>
<P>From this Time to that of her Death,
few Days pa&s;s'd in which I did not either
&s;ee or hear from her; for &s;he gave me the
Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing all her Poems as &s;oon as
they were fini&s;h'd. And though I never
was extremely fond of Poetry, and don't
pretend to be a Judge of it, there was
&s;omething &s;o peculiarly plea&s;ing to my
Ta&s;te in almo&s;t every thing &s;he wrote,
that I could not but be infinitely pleas'd
with &s;uch a Corre&s;pondent.</P>
<P>Nor did I admire her in her Poetical
Capacity only; but the more I was ac|quainted
with her, the more I &s;aw Rea&s;on
to e&s;teem her for tho&s;e virtuous Principles,
and that Goodne&s;s of Heart and Temper,
which &s;o vi&s;ibly appeared in her; and I
was &s;o far from thinking it a Conde&s;cen|&s;ion
to cultivate an Acquaintance with a
<PB N="xxii" REF="20">
Per&s;on in her Station, that I rather e&s;teem'd
it an Honour to be call'd a Friend to one
in whom there appear'd &s;uch a true Great|ne&s;s
of Soul as with me far outweigh'd all
the Advantages of Birth and Fortune.
Nor do I think it po&s;&s;ible for any body
that was as well acquainted with her as
my&s;elf, to con&s;ider her as a mean Per&s;on.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent a Li&s;t of the Poems that
were wrote &s;ince I was acquainted with
her; which, I think, will &s;hew the Quick|ne&s;s
of her Genius, e&s;pecially when it is
con&s;ider'd how much &s;he was engaged in
her Father's Affairs, and the Bu&s;ine&s;s of
his Hou&s;e, in which &s;he had nobody to
a&s;&s;i&s;t her.</P>
<P>This, you may imagine, was &s;ome Mor|tification
to a Per&s;on of her Turn; yet
&s;he was always chearful: And as &s;he
wanted none of the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life,
expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf thankful for that. Her
chief Ambition &s;eem'd to be to have &s;uch
a Competency as might leave her at Li|berty
to enjoy the Company of a Friend,
and indulge her &s;cribbling Humour (as &s;he
<PB N="xxiii" REF="21">
call'd it) when &s;he had a mind, without
Inconvenience or Interruption.</P>
<P>I could not &s;ee how much &s;he was
&s;traiten'd in point of Time for her Writing,
without endeavouring to remove the Dif|ficulty;
and therefore propos'd a Sub|&s;cription
to &s;ome of my Acquaintance;
which I hoped might be a Means of do|ing
it. And here, Sir, I mu&s;t gratefully
acknowlege your kind A&s;&s;i&s;tance, without
which I am &s;en&s;ible all my Endeavours
had been ineffectual; but through your
Good-nature I had the Plea&s;ure to &s;ee it
brought into a promi&s;ing Way before the
Death of the Author; who unfortunately
did not live to receive that Benefit by it,
which has &s;ince accrued to her Father.</P>
<P>Since the Publication of her Poems, I
hear &s;he has been accu&s;ed of &s;tealing from
other Authors; but I believe very unju&s;t|ly,
and imagine the Cen&s;ure proceeds ra|ther
from a random Conjecture that it
mu&s;t be &s;o, than any ju&s;t Foundation. I
don't find that the Particulars are pointed
out; and if there are really any Lines in
<PB N="xxiv" REF="22">
her Book that bear &s;o near a Re&s;emblance
to what has been wrote by other Authors,
as to give room for &s;uch a Conjecture, I,
that was &s;o well acquainted with her
Way of Thinking, dare venture to an&s;wer
for her, that it proceeded from the Im|pre&s;&s;ion
the Reading tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages &s;ome
time before happen'd to make upon her
Mind, without her remembring from
whence they came; and therefore &s;he can
no more be reckon'd a Plagiary on that
Account, than a Per&s;on could ju&s;tly be
accu&s;ed of being a Thief, for making u&s;e
of a Shilling or two of another's Money
that happen'd to be mix'd with his own,
without his knowing it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I don't believe it impo&s;&s;ible for
two People to think exactly alike upon a
Subject, and even to expre&s;s them&s;elves al|mo&s;t
in the very &s;ame Words for a Line
or two, without ever having been ac|quainted
with one another's Thoughts;
tho' I don't know that this was the Ca&s;e
of <HI>Myra.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg Leave to give you an In|&s;tance
of her Probity in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="xxv" REF="23">
I one Day &s;hew'd her an old manu|&s;cript
Pa&s;toral of Mr. <HI>Newton</HI>'s, in Blank
Ver&s;e; with which &s;he &s;eem'd much
plea&s;ed, and de&s;ired Leave to take it home
with her, and amu&s;e her&s;elf with putting
&s;ome Parts of it, that &s;he mo&s;t liked, into
Rhyme. She did &s;o<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See the Poems, Vol. I. p. 183, 187, 192.</NOTE>; and in my Opinion
&s;o greatly alter'd and improv'd them, that
when the Papers were fir&s;t &s;ent to you,
in order to be printed, I &s;aid I thought
there was no Occa&s;ion for mentioning Mr.
<HI>Newton</HI>'s Name: But &s;he would not con|&s;ent
to have them put in her Book with|out
that Di&s;tinction; and indeed had no
occa&s;ion to adopt other Peoples Produc|tions.</P>
<P>Deceit and In&s;incerity of all Kinds &s;he
abhorred; and (if I may be allowed to
give my Opinion) I really believe what
&s;he wrote upon Serious and Divine Sub|jects,
proceeded from the inmo&s;t Senti|ments
of her Heart; which I take to be
one great Rea&s;on of their appearing &s;o ex|tremely
natural and beautiful.</P>
<P>As an In&s;tance of her uncommon Man|ner
of Thinking, give me Leave to acquaint
<PB N="xxvi" REF="24">
you with a Di&s;cour&s;e that pa&s;s'd between
us, when the Propo&s;al for a Sub&s;cription
was on foot. I very gravely told her, I
thought we mu&s;t endeavour to find out
&s;ome great Lady to be her Patrone&s;s, and
de&s;ir'd her to prepare a hand&s;ome Dedi|cation.</P>
<P>&startq;But pray, what am I to &s;ay in this
&s;ame Dedication?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Oh, a great many fine Things, cer|tainly.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But, Madam, I am not acquainted
with any great Lady, nor like to be.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No matter for that; 'tis but your
&s;uppo&s;ing your Patrone&s;s to have as
many Virtues as other Peoples always
have: You need not fear &s;aying too
much; and I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She really &s;eemed &s;hock'd, and &s;aid,
But, Dear Madam, could you in good
Earne&s;t approve of my &s;itting down to
write an Encomium upon a Per&s;on I
<PB N="xxvii" REF="25">
know nothing of, only becau&s;e I might
hope to get &s;omething by it?&mdash;No,
<HI>Myra!</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>She always call'd it being idle, and in|dulging
her whim&s;ical Humour, when &s;he
was employed in writing the humorous
Parts of her Poems; and nothing could
pique her more than Peoples imagining &s;he
took a great deal of Pains, or &s;pent a great
deal of Time, in &s;uch Compo&s;ures; or that
&s;he &s;et much Value upon them.</P>
<P>She told me, that mo&s;t of them were
wrote when cro&s;s Accidents happen'd to
di&s;turb her, purely to divert her Thoughts
from dwelling upon what was di&s;agreeable;
and that it generally had the intended Ef|fect,
by putting her in a good Humour.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now come to the melancholy
Scene of her Death; which, to my inex|pre&s;&s;ible
Concern, happen'd on the 12th of
<HI>November</HI> 1746. and was occa&s;ioned by
the Mea&s;les.</P>
<P><PB N="xxviii" REF="26">
A Day or two before her Departure,
while her Sen&s;es remained perfect, &s;he de|&s;ir'd
to &s;peak to me alone; and after the
warme&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions of Gratitude for my
Goodne&s;s to her, as &s;he call'd it, continued,
as near as I can remember, in this manner.</P>
<P>&startq;But I have &s;till one Favour to beg of
you.&mdash;I find I am going.&mdash;I always
lov'd my Father; but I feel it now
more than ever.&mdash;He is growing into
Years.&mdash;My Heart bleeds to &s;ee the
Concern he is in; and it would be the
utmo&s;t Satisfaction to me, if I could
hope any thing of mine could contri|bute
to his comfortable Sub&s;i&s;tence in
his old Age: I therefore beg of you to
take the Key of my Buroe; and if any
thing is to be made of my poor Papers,
that you will, for my &s;ake, endeavour to
promote a Sub&s;cription for his Bene|fit,
which you &s;o kindly have propos'd
for mine.&endq;</P>
<P>They mu&s;t have had harder Hearts than
mine, that could have refus'd to comply
with &s;uch a Reque&s;t. I promis'd to do
<PB N="xxix" REF="27">
the be&s;t I could (with which &s;he &s;eem'd
&s;atisfied); and have endeavour'd to per|form
it to the utmo&s;t of my Power.</P>
<P>Since I received your Letter, I have
applied to Mr. <HI>Leapor</HI> for what Informa|tion
he could give me relating to his
Daughter.</P>
<P>He tells me, She was born at <HI>Mar&s;ton
St. Laurence</HI> in this County, on the 26th
of <HI>February</HI> 1722. at which Time he was
Gardener to the late Judge <HI>Blencowe,</HI> and
continued five Years in the Family; and
then removed with his Wife and this only
Daughter to <HI>Brackley,</HI> where &s;he &s;pent the
remaining Part of her Life.</P>
<P>She was bred up under the Care of a
pious and &s;en&s;ible Mother, who died about
four Years before her.</P>
<P>He informs me &s;he was always fond
of reading every thing that came in her
way, as &s;oon as &s;he was capable of it;
and that when &s;he had learnt to write to|lerably,
which, as he remembers, was at
<PB N="xxx" REF="28">
about ten or eleven Years old, She would
often be &s;cribbling, and &s;ometimes in
Rhyme; which her Mother was at fir&s;t
pleas'd with: But finding this Humour
increa&s;e upon her as &s;he grew up, when
&s;he thought her capable of more profitable
Employment, &s;he endeavour'd to break
her of it; and that he likewi&s;e, having no
Ta&s;te for Poetry, and not imagining it
could ever be any Advantage to her, join'd
in the &s;ame De&s;ign: But finding it im|po&s;&s;ible
to alter her natural Inclination,
he had of late de&s;i&s;ted, and left her more
at Liberty.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, &s;he never had any intimate
Companion, except one agreeable young
Woman in this Town, whom &s;he men|tions
in her Poem upon <HI>Friend&s;hip,</HI> by
the Name of FIDELIA; and that &s;he al|ways
cho&s;e to &s;pend her lei&s;ure Hours in
Writing and Reading, rather than in tho&s;e
Diver&s;ions which young People generally
chu&s;e; in&s;omuch that &s;ome of the
Neighbours that ob&s;erv'd it, expre&s;&s;ed
their Concern, le&s;t the Girl &s;hould over|&s;tudy
her&s;elf, and be mopi&s;h. But to me
<PB N="xxxi" REF="29">
&s;he always appeared rather gay, than me|lancholy.</P>
<P>I think it is now high time to apolo|gize
for this long Letter: But as I was
re&s;olved to &s;end the be&s;t Account I
could, I hope, Sir, you will excu&s;e me.
It is not for me to pretend to do Ju&s;tice
to the Memory of Mrs. LEAPOR; but if
you think any of the little Incidents I have
mention'd will be u&s;eful to the Gentlemen
who have &s;o kindly form'd that De&s;ign,
and give them a true Idea of her, I &s;hall
be much plea&s;ed; and am, with true Re|&s;pect,</P>

obliged humble Servant,</CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTERS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by Mrs. LEAPOR.</BYLINE>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The following Piece was written by the Author
when very young.</HEAD>
<P>_UPON my lately reading a Di&s;cour&s;e,
wherein the Author &s;eemed to reflect
with great Severity on the Errors and
Vices of wealthy People, and at the &s;ame time
to congratulate the Poor, in that their Poverty
&s;ecured them again&s;t various Temptations, e&s;pe|cially
Pride; &s;ome little Contradiction ari&s;ing
in my Mind, led me in&s;en&s;ibly into a Train of
Thoughts, which I &s;hall pre&s;ent to the Reader
without any further Apology.&mdash;If we con|&s;ider
the Behaviour of Mankind, from the
Prince to the Pea&s;ant, we &s;hall find the Seeds
of the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;ions, the &s;ame Virtues and
<PB N="304" REF="334">
Vices, in all Ranks and Degrees of Peo|ple:
Pride is a kind of epidemical Vice in
the Minds of Youth; with which, in different
Degrees, all are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and exert them&s;elves
according to their different Circum&s;tances. A
new Gown, a lac'd Mob, a Necklace, and a
Topknot, are Felicities courted with as much
Impatience, and pur&s;ued with as great Anxiety,
by ordinary Females, as rich Brocades, gilt
Chariots, and powder'd Footmen, are by tho&s;e
in a more con&s;picuous Station. The &s;ame Ob|&s;ervation
may be made in the Male World;
and, in my Opinion, a new Surtout, or a modi&s;h
Wig, are Motives full as worthy to engage the
Attention of a rea&s;onable Creature, as a Silver-hilted
Sword, or an embroider'd Wai&s;tcoat.
Wealth is certainly a great Ble&s;&s;ing, when it falls
into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of worthy Per&s;ons: It gives
a Lu&s;tre to tho&s;e Virtues and Attainments, that,
without it, dwindle away, and are lo&s;t in Ob|&s;curity:
It adds Reverence to the Divine, Au|thority
to the Philo&s;opher, Honour to the Sol|dier,
and at lea&s;t, his u&s;ual Recompence, Prai&s;e
the Poet. On the other hand, altho' the
mode&s;t Virgin, the tender Mother, the agreeable
Friend, and the pious Matron, are Gems that
will &s;hew them&s;elves to Advantage, even in a
<PB N="305" REF="335">
Cottage; yet how much more amiable are the&s;e
Accompli&s;hments in a higher Station, when
adorned with Genero&s;ity, Learning, and a re|fined
Behaviour! But then, as Virtue appears
in a more maje&s;tic Form by the Addition of
Wealth and Power; &s;o the Vices and ill Qua|lities
of People of Condition appear with a Face
of double Deformity, by rea&s;on their Behaviour
has a &s;ort of Influence on the re&s;t of Mankind.
I have before ob&s;erved, that there is a Tincture
of Ambition in all Degrees; and tho&s;e who
cannot come up to the Wi&s;dom and Sublimities
of their Superiors, can at lea&s;t imitate their Vices
and Imperfections. How &s;hocking then is the
Behaviour of &s;ome Per&s;ons ble&s;&s;ed with plen|teous
Fortunes, good Under&s;tanding, &s;prightly
Wit, and Talents which, if rightly applied,
would di&s;tingui&s;h them more from the re&s;t of
Mankind, than the Number of their Acres, or
the In&s;olence of their Power; yet, charmed
with the mock Homage of their &s;ilken Slaves,
and &s;tupid with intoxicating Plea&s;ure, he gives
a Loo&s;e to his long-&s;truggling Pa&s;&s;ions, to take
in Luxury, with its licentious Train! Di&s;carded
Rea&s;on having taken her Flight, charmed with
his new Companions, the intoxicated Idiot
&s;carce believes he is mortal; Pride, Tyranny,
<PB N="306" REF="336">
and Rapine, follow; and Innocence and Beauty
fall unpitied Victims at his lawle&s;s Altar. Thus,
if pamper'd Vice makes &s;o terrible a Figure,
how careful ought tho&s;e to be, whom Provi|dence
has entru&s;ted with a larger Share of what
we call the Goods of Fortune, that they may
not, by their Example, corrupt the Minds of
tho&s;e below them! For altho', as I have before
hinted, there are the &s;ame Inclinations to Ill in
all &s;orts of People, yet the Vices, as well as
Virtues, of the Indigent are not &s;o vi&s;ible, nor
&s;o much regarded in the Eye of the World,
tho' they are of the &s;ame Con&s;equence to their
own Per&s;ons; and neither Wealth nor Power,
Poverty nor Subjection, can &s;ecure us from
tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions and Inquietudes &s;o natural and &s;o
painful to a thinking Being. Ambition is the
con&s;tant Torment of &s;prightly and a&s;piring
Minds: It haunts the Wi&s;e thro' all their varied
Sy&s;tems of Philo&s;ophy, and reigns within the
Bo&s;om of the Satiri&s;t, even whil&s;t he ridicules
it as an un&s;atisfying and empty Folly. Provi|dence
does not think fit always to be&s;tow
Wealth upon the greate&s;t Minds; but, on the
contrary, People of the be&s;t Capacities are often
under the Frowns, or at lea&s;t the Indifference,
of Fortune: It is a great Happine&s;s, when &s;uch

Per&s;ons can &s;uit their Minds to their Condition.
It is not in every one's Power to be rich; but
it is in every one's Power to be content, if he
will endeavour it; unle&s;s the Party be under
the immediate Hand of great Poverty, or real
Sorrow; and then I believe it &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for
a Per&s;on that has any Ta&s;te of Happine&s;s or
Mi&s;ery to be truly ea&s;y, while he is under the
dreadful Apprehen&s;ion of wanting the com|mon
Nece&s;&s;aries of Life: But where Poverty
does not appear in &s;uch a frightful Shape, it is
a great Ab&s;urdity to lo&s;e the Ta&s;te of pre&s;ent
Enjoyments, by gra&s;ping and mourning for
Things beyond all Po&s;&s;ibility of our ever obtain|ing.
Tho&s;e who cannot &s;hine in a partial and
ingrateful World, may de&s;pi&s;e it; and, con|&s;cious
of their Innocence and concealed Per|fections,
may, with equal Temper, look down
on Cen&s;ure and Applau&s;e. This happy Virtue
will bear the Per&s;on who enjoys it &s;afe thro'
the tumultuous Waves of Sorrow, Di&s;appoint|ment,
Cen&s;ure, and Deri&s;ion; and open a Pro|&s;pect,
thro' the Gloom that hangs about him,
to a more more joyful Scene of Peace, Ju&s;tice,
and Immortality.</P>

tho' I hope there is no immediate Dan|ger:
But I would prepare you for the wor&s;t:
And, if my Arguments are &s;illy, they proceed
from a well-meant Sincerity. In &s;pit$ of all our
<PB N="322" REF="352">
Sorrow for the Lo&s;s of a good and worthy Per|&s;on,
there is a Con&s;olation that will &s;hine thro'

with the Help of Time, is a great
Allay to this afflicting Pa&s;&s;ion. To &s;ay you
have enjoy'd a Parent much longer than you
could probably expect, is nothing to the Pur|po&s;e:
We know habitual Conver&s;e makes the
Link more &s;trong: And 'tis ea&s;ier to part
with a Friend at Nineteen, while we are full

<P>Another aggravating Circum&s;tance which I

this: That your la&s;t Friend is now at Stake:
That in her you lo&s;e all the Tenderne&s;s of a

wide to make any great Impre&s;&s;ion on your

and turn our Eyes to tho&s;e who are more pro|perly
&s;tyled the Unhappy. If I might be al|lowed
to make the Compari&s;on, our Conditions,
in this Place, &s;eem a little parallel: But, &s;hould
I &s;urvive my Parent, the Event would be very
different. You lo&s;e a fond Parent, that doats
upon you, and all the tender Comforts that
flow from her: I lo&s;e both that, and all the
Nece&s;&s;aries of Life: Left naked and defencele&s;s,
without Friend, and without Dependence;
with a weak and indolent Body to provide
for its own Sub&s;i&s;tence; and a re&s;tle&s;s Mind,
rack'd with unprofitable Invention. This is
no very plea&s;ing Pro&s;pect; but I &s;eldom dwell
long upon it.</P>
<P>I am now to beg Pardon for this long Epi&s;tle.
