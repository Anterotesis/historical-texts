<P>_THIS POEM was publi&s;hed by the Author in 1746. The Sub|ject is important; the Sentiments ju&s;t, and &s;trong; the Images beautiful, and natural. Yet, in the Train of Rea&s;oning, a certain Connection &s;eemed to be wanting: In the Sentiments, <HI>clearne&s;s</HI>, and <HI>per&s;picuity</HI>; and in the Images, <HI>&s;amene&s;s</HI>, and <HI>&s;implicity</HI>. Mixt Metaphor al&s;o was &s;ometimes admitted; and the Style, tho' &s;trong, yet in &s;ome Places appeared too har&s;h and rough. The&s;e &s;mall Imperfections, in a WORK of &s;uch Genius and Spirit, and &s;o worthy of E&s;teem, &s;eemed to require Amend|ment. This is now attempted, in a Manner,

<NOTE PLACE="foot">The Poem begins with a &s;olemn Addre&s;s and Invocation of the DEITY; and after acknowledging the Incapacity of MAN to comprehend the Nature of GOD, as he is in him&s;elf, the Au|thor refers to his WORKS, which exhibit a Repre&s;entation of his Power, Wi&s;dom, and Goodne&s;s: from which Manife&s;tation, or Revelation, we derive all that we believe, or know with Cer|tainty concerning him. This Attempt to explain our Belief, or Knowledge of GOD, he begins with that Humility, Reverence, and Re&s;ignation, which becomes Man, when he &s;eeks to know, or endeavours to explain the WILL, or LAW of his MAKER.</NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P N="23">(23.) He next proceeds to cen&s;ure tho&s;e Notions as chime|rical, which are built on any other Foundation, than on NA|TURE. The&s;e Notions have been woven into artificial Sy&s;tems, no ways conformable to the Order of NATURE; con&s;e|quently, in&s;tead of a true and faithful Repre&s;entation of the WILL, or LAW of GOD, they exhibit only the chimerical and arbitrary WILL of MAN. They are derived either from Pride and Arrogance, which are the Sources of FANATICISM, and fal&s;e ENTHUSIASM; or from Fear and Ignorance, which are the Sources of Super&s;tition; or from a Mixture of all the&s;e with a LITTLE TRUTH, which produces Bigotry. The Con&s;e|quence is, that Mankind, under this ill Direction, acquires a fal&s;e Humility, and unnatural Deba&s;ement, to fear without Cau&s;e of Fear, to hope without Cau&s;e of Hope, and to love and hate without Regard of Truth and Fal&s;hood, of Virtue and Vice, tho&s;e natural marks which God has fixed on Things, to make them lovely or hateful.</P>
<P>"SNAKY ROD." This Epithet comprehends a great deal. It perfectly characteri&s;es the Genius of Impo&s;ture, by which Super&s;tition has been woven into a Sy&s;tem &s;o my&s;terious, that even MOSES, the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Lawgiver, who&s;e De&s;ign was to re|veal that My&s;tery, and to counteract its Influence, hath yet been drawn to co-operate with it. His De&s;ign was evidently directed to e&s;tabli&s;h a Sy&s;tem of pure THEISM, and with that, a State of rational, or perfect FREEDOM, as a Con&s;equence of TRUTH, in Oppo&s;ition to Super&s;tition and the Con&s;equences of it, Ty|ranny and Bondage. The great OUTLINES of his Plan prove this noble Truth mo&s;t evidently. The&s;e, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd &s;ome Way or other, have been fill'd up gro&s;sly enough. They have e&s;cap'd however, the Touch of Corruption. This is in|deed a great, and real Ble&s;&s;ing: how they have e&s;caped, is a great, and real Miracle. But Fraud, in concealing it&s;elf, al|ways leaves &s;ome Part uncover'd; like the O&s;trich, who, when he is pur&s;ued, by hiding his Head only, thinks he conceals his Body. The Ab&s;urdities, the Incon&s;i&s;tencies, and the Contra|dictions, which have been added to his Plan, are al&s;o plain. They are ea&s;ily &s;eparated and rejected: &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible that both cou'd be de&s;igned, or dictated by the &s;ame Per&s;on: and that, in the noble&s;t De&s;ign, either a good Man &s;hou'd u&s;e Impo&s;ture, or a wi&s;e Man admit &s;uch Contradictions, as wou'd not only corrupt, but in Effect, ab&s;olutely de&s;troy it. All Objections therefore again&s;t the&s;e Contradictions are admitted; but when the&s;e are removed, the Objections are removed too. But Ob|jections yet remain again&s;t the very Plan and real De&s;ign of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>. The&s;e Objections, and the Defen&s;e made by Reli|gioni&s;ts, are both founded in the &s;ame Mi&s;take. The FALL of MAN &s;eems to be entirely mi&s;under&s;tood by both; according to which fundamental Mi&s;take, the Objections are undoubtedly unan&s;werable. I &s;hall endeavour, therefore, to explain this important Subject in a Treati&s;e concerning the Life of MOSES. Mean time the following Hint,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. See p. 12 and 16. Notes.</NOTE> perhaps may a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e, who are willing to try their own Conjectures. There is no Difficulty, no Ob&s;curity; the whole Proce&s;s is plain and obvious: he can &s;carce mi&s;s &s;eeing it, whoever under&s;tands the Genius of My|thology, the Similitudes, and Analogies of NATURE, and the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Art of Application. The&s;e Similitudes are applied by MOSES with a beautiful Plainne&s;s and Simplicity; and this very Plainne&s;s, perhaps, has conceal'd his De&s;ign: while &s;ome in all the Pride of fal&s;e Knowledge, and vain Philo&s;ophy, can &s;ee No|thing but &s;upernatural My&s;tery, and others, intangled in their own Cunning, Nothing which does not promote their Intere&s;t. And ev'n Writers of the free&s;t Genius, and greate&s;t Capacity, &s;eem not wholly to have comprehended this My&s;tery. Dr. MIDDLETON &s;aw it was an Allegory: Lord BOLING|BROKE calls it a moral, philo&s;ophical, <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Allegory: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The hone&s;t and learned M. BUNCLE calls the <HI>Mo&s;aical</HI> In|&s;titution, Chri&s;tianity in Hieroglyphicks. This approaches &s;till nearer to Truth; but wants yet a more full Explication.</NOTE> but they &s;aw no more.</P>
<P>Divines have run the ERROR of the FALL into Chri&s;tia|nity. My&s;tery is employ'd to explain My&s;tery; and the Re|velation of a My&s;tery, and the Explanation of that Revelation become yet more my&s;terious: till by the&s;e Means natural Theo|logy is quite ab&s;orbed in artificial; the WORKS, the WILL, the LAW of GOD un&s;een, and the WILL of MAN arbitrarily &s;ub&s;ti|tuted. The Con&s;equence is plain: VICE, SUPERSTITION, ATHEISM, TYRANNY.</P></NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="foot">(55.) <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> is &s;tiled by the Satiri&s;t&mdash;<HI>Felix Terra|rum</HI> PRAEDO.&mdash;In Religion the &s;ame Species of Madne&s;s, or er|rant Heroi&s;m has prevailed.&mdash;When Men, under Pretence of FAITH in imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s, are made to believe that Hap|pine&s;s is in&s;ur'd to Vice, they run blindly into a Sort of arrogant Pride, Scorn, and Abhorrence of VIRTUE, when it is expre&s;s'd in the Characters of Men, who&s;e FAITH (as they call it) is not orthodox. This unnatural Pa&s;&s;ion of religious Malevolence is noted by the Word Bigotry; and con&s;titutes a Character the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to Truth, Virtue and Chri&s;tianity. It was that very Species of Madne&s;s, which prevailed among the Jews, when they are &s;aid "to take the Kingdom of Heaven by Force;" that very Madne&s;s, which made them hate, vilify and murder their great Reformer: and that very Species of Madne&s;s, which makes ev'n tho&s;e, who pretend to be his Di&s;|ciples, counteract his Doctrine, and hate, vilify and per&s;ecute all who are his real Di&s;ciples; all, who, like him, are Lovers of TRUTH and VIRTUE, that is, perfect THEISTS.</NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(63) When Religioni&s;ts ab&s;urdly mi&s;plead the WILL of GOD in Defence of Actions unju&s;t, cruel and malevolent, they ab&s;olutely de&s;troy the Idea or Notion of a DEITY; and while they pretend to reveal his WILL, act in plain Confederacy with Athei&s;ts, who deny it. It &s;eems probable that this latter Species of Madne&s;s is only the former a little extended, and that ATHEISM is Super&s;ti|tion at full growth.</NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="foot">(71.) TRUTH, 'tis pre&s;um'd, is the COMMON RIGHT of Mankind; how then dares any Man pretend a &s;ole Right, or Commi&s;&s;ion to under&s;tand, or teach it? They who under&s;tand it be&s;t, and are therefore be&s;t qualified to teach it, are certainly lea&s;t apt to make a claim &s;o fooli&s;hly arrogant, and at the &s;ame time &s;o pernicious to the Freedom, Peace and Happine&s;s of Mankind.</NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(73&mdash;75.) And why, if any are indeed commi&s;&s;ion'd to reveal the WILL of GOD to guide Mankind in Truth, Virtue and Happine&s;s, do they yet conceal that WILL by revealing it &s;o darkly, that the Revelation it&s;elf is a My&s;tery? Certainly a wi&s;e Man for his own Sake, and a good Man for the Sake of others, wou'd act more generou&s;ly. If they wou'd teach the Art of &s;eeing and recog|nizing the WILL of GOD from his Works, without Impo&s;ture or Fal&s;ification, they wou'd be wi&s;e and good indeed, while they thus acted a Part truly honourable to them&s;elves and beneficial to Mankind. It was the Objection of PORPHIRY to MOSES, that he
<Q>&startq;repre&s;ented GOD as a Being, who envied Mankind the &endq;Knowledge of Truth:</Q>
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.&mdash;That famous Philo&s;opher, if he plea&s;ed, might have objected this to his own Religion. It is &s;aid of APOLLO, and of his Prie&s;ts, (who yet, more than the re&s;t of that Sort, favour'd, and indulg'd the Free|dom of WIT and REASON)
<Q>&startq;that they neither told, nor con|&endq;ceal'd their Meaning; but made SIGNS.</Q>
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. In the earlie&s;t Times, before Lan|guage was completely form'd by U&s;e, and extended to compre|hend and expre&s;s all external Impre&s;&s;ions, or Ideas of Things, the Things them&s;elves were frequently employ'd, either by Action or Repre&s;entation, and according to their various Agree|ments, and Similitudes, &s;ub&s;tituted for each other. This Sub|&s;titution was a SIGN. Afterwards, when Language was form'd, the U&s;e and Application of it was yet, even among the few, who under&s;tood it, deem'd an Accompli&s;hment little inferior to In&s;pi|ration; and &s;till more, when by the Invention and U&s;e of Let|ters, tho&s;e Sounds or Words were expre&s;s'd, was it e&s;teem'd a Sort of MIRACLE. Hence WORD and REASON became Equi|valents in the <HI>Greek</HI> Language, among a People ever curious and inqui&s;itive, who under the Influence of Freedom, and a happy Genius, made &s;uch a Progre&s;s in Arts and Sciences, as even at this Time is beheld with Admiration. Yet even among them there was a Time, when Language was reckon'd among the greate&s;t Accompli&s;hments, and writing was a &s;acred Thing. And indeed this latter notion extends even to our own Times, among whom, tho' Books are &s;o common, that the Impre&s;&s;ions of Novelty, wonder and Authority, are now no longer connected with them, yet by the Vulgar the&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions and Connexions are yet retained, in who&s;e Opinion nothing more is wanted to realize and verify a Fact, than to find it written in a Book.&mdash; Such however was the &s;low Progre&s;&s;ion of Knowledge, both by SIGNS and WORDS, that while it depended on the Veracity and Ability of tho&s;e, who u&s;ed them, either to in&s;truct, or to be in|&s;tructed, both ways of advancing it have been always liable to Ob&s;tructions and Impediments from Ob&s;curity, Ambiguity and Error. As to SIGNS, though among the Antients, as well as now, there were Men of mean Genius, and &s;elfi&s;h Pa&s;&s;ions, who wou'd &s;ometimes abu&s;e them, either in&s;ignificantly, or de|ceitfully, yet by the great Legi&s;lators, and in capital Points, they are always employ'd to convey a wi&s;e and good Meaning: for this is a great Truth, that the Antients were no FOOLS. Signs in &s;ome Ca&s;es may be u&s;ed with equal Exactne&s;s and Preci|&s;ion, and even with greater Propriety, Force and Vivacity of Impre&s;&s;ion, than Words. They have moreover this Advantage, that by &s;eeming to conceal Truth, or rather by a middle Way between hiding and revealing, and either by a mode&s;t Re&s;erve, or by a graceful manner of Di&s;covery, they excite Curio&s;ity, en|gage Attention, and e&s;tabli&s;h and pre&s;erve, from the Indifference of too much Familiarity, tho&s;e original Impre&s;&s;ions, which be|long to it, of Novelty, Admiration, and Authority. And hence by the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> they were appropriated to Religion, and termed SACRED LETTERS. We ought not therefore in our Interpre|tations of tho&s;e mythical Allegories, or HOLY WRIT, to be too ha&s;ty in dogmatizing, or in fixing and re&s;training them to a &s;in|gle determinate Meaning; for though even that may &s;ometimes be done with great Beauty and Propriety, yet as they are of a copious Invention, and fruitful of various Meanings, &s;uch a Re|&s;traint, and preci&s;ion, &s;eems rather to be a Retrenchment of their Abundance, than an Addition to their Strength. Here the Imagination and Rea&s;on &s;hould be left free and unre&s;train'd: the more they are exerci&s;ed, the greater and better will be the Entertainment, and In&s;truction; e&s;pecially if &s;ufficient Caution be applied in excluding all Ab&s;urdity, Incon&s;i&s;tency and Contra|diction. The Antients drew immediately from NATURE. They did not attempt to form, connect and harmonize chimerical, fan|ta&s;tical, and &s;upernatural Imaginations, which, like Dreams, or fleeting Clouds, are too &s;lippery and evane&s;cent, to be reduc'd to a &s;table Form, or to pre&s;erve Connexion, and Proportion. This is &s;aid only of tho&s;e, who had Genius and Ability. It is &s;aid, and may be prov'd of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>. That Lawgiver did not conceal his "ART to KNOW." It was his De&s;ign, in reforming from <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Super&s;tition to reveal, that which they affected to con|ceal; and to reject that, which they affected to publi&s;h. But when afterwards, fal&s;e Knowledge and chimerical Notions were employ'd to interpret and explain his De&s;ign, which was wholly drawn from the Agreements and Similarities of Nature, the Con|&s;equence has been &s;een in a Sy&s;tem deform'd with Ab&s;urdity, Incon&s;i&s;tency and Contradiction, and felt in the Effects of Su|per&s;tition, Fanatici&s;m, and Bigotry; by which that De&s;ign hath not only been corrupted, but even &s;ubverted, and de&s;troyed. There is no other Way to attain a real Knowledge, and true Feeling of the WILL or Law of GOD, than by a mode&s;t, &s;ober, and careful Examination of his WORKS, a diligent Attention, and Ob&s;ervation of NATURE, and a faithful Report, or Repre|&s;entation of it. The Mind of Man will gradually conform, and harmonize it&s;elf to this Knowledge, by cu&s;tomary Impre&s;&s;ions; and the Opinions, Sentiments, and Manners will all follow in a natural Order, and regular Progre&s;&s;ion, agreeable to the provi|dential State and Cour&s;e of Things, and to the various Relations and Connexions of human Dependence. They who &s;eek the WILL of GOD in any other Way, will for ever wander in Er|ror, deceiving and deceived: and they who pretend to teach it in any other Way, are "BLIND LEADERS of the BLIND." NATURE only points the Way, and marks the Road, which leads to Truth, to Virtue, and to Happine&s;s, according to that common Doctrine of the old Philo&s;ophy: <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. This Rule is now inverted: and how can we be &s;aid to go right, when we don't even aim right? I think it was BOILEAU, who ob&s;erving NA|TURE to be well under&s;tood, and faithfully imitated by MO|LIERE, de&s;ir'd (as he &s;aid) to learn of him, "L'ART de la TROVER.</NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(77.) If the&s;e authori&s;ed or commi&s;&s;ioned Teachers of TRUTH drew their Explanations from NATURE, &s;uch Explanations wou'd be proportion'd to human REASON, and the Sen&s;e of Duty or Obligation wou'd ari&s;e from the noble&s;t Motives, and from that, which by the con&s;titution of NATURE, and Ap|pointment of GOD, is the RULER, or REGULATOR of them; whereas, according to the Sy&s;tem of artificial Religion, tho&s;e Mo|tives are derived either from HOPE and PRIDE, the vaine&s;t and mo&s;t delu&s;ive, or from FEAR and CREDULITY, the ba&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ervile Parts of human Nature. Hence the Effect, on one Hand, will always be IMPLICIT FAITH, not in GOD, (of whom by the&s;e Means, nothing can be known, but what wou'd unworthily be attributed even to MAN) but in tho&s;e who pretend to be his in&s;pir'd, or commi&s;&s;ion'd LEGATES, and EMBASSA|DORS. For HOPE and PRIDE, with Ignorance, are the Sources of FANATICISM, and FEAR and CREDULITY, with Ignorance, are the Sources of SUPERSTITION; while a Mixture of all to|gether produces BIGOTRY, the very wor&s;t and mo&s;t poi&s;onous Compo&s;ition that ever was invented and prepar'd in the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical College.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE> The Effects of it are de&s;cribed l. 87&mdash;91.</NOTE>

<P>I believe this ruling Principle, or Faculty of the Mind, which &s;eems to di&s;tingui&s;h Man from Man, as much as Man from Bea&s;t, whenever by Exerci&s;e and Di&s;cipline it ri&s;es to any Degree of Maturity and Perfection, is always accompanied with Mode&s;ty, and in &s;earching the mo&s;t &s;ublime Truths relating to DEITY, with Humility and Re&s;ignation. To every ingenuous Mind therefore it mu&s;t be equally grievous either to compell, or be compell'd. FAITH, when it &s;ignifies Belief, is either ac|quir'd by CUSTOM, or by REASON. When it is acquir'd by Cu&s;tom, it ari&s;es from a frequent Repetition, or Continuation of the &s;ame, or &s;imilar Impre&s;&s;ions made on the Mind, either by NATURE, or by ART. Both the&s;e Sorts of Belief are implicit, the fir&s;t in GOD, the &s;econd in MAN. They both equally avoid and abhor Doubt, and Enquiry. Hence in the fir&s;t Sort it hap|pens that various Species of DEITY are exhibited to the Mind, according to its Capacity, and the Temperament of its Affections, and Pa&s;&s;ions; while the &s;econd receives Form and Fa&s;hion in|tirely from Authority, po&s;itive In&s;titution, and arbitrary WILL. The former therefore is natural Super&s;tition, the latter artificial; and while the one may be con&s;ider'd as the fir&s;t rude Efforts of the Mind in Pur&s;uit of TRUTH, the other is a fal&s;e Direction of it. In one it fails through Weakne&s;s; in the other through De|&s;ign. The fir&s;t is MERE Super&s;tition, the la&s;t MERE Impo&s;ture. It is plain therefore that both the&s;e Sorts of Belief are liable to much Error: the fir&s;t by the Imperfection of our Minds; the &s;econd by a wrong Direction or Application of tho&s;e Imperfections, when by Craft they are woven into artificial Sy&s;tems, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Power and Force. When external Impre&s;&s;ions, or Matters of Fact, are regulated and corrected according to the con&s;tant Cour&s;e of Things, or Standard of NATURE, from whence they are derived; the Belief, which before was merely cu&s;tomary and impli|cit, now becomes rational. The Proof ri&s;es above Doubt, and the Conclu&s;ion is Truth. This Regulation is made by an exact and careful Examination, and Recognition, of the true Power, or Moment of all tho&s;e Faculties or Sen&s;es, which receive and con|vey natural Impre&s;&s;ions to the Imagnation. This Recognition is effected by Rea&s;on, the Corrector and Regulator of all the other Powers or Faculties of the Mind. Rational Belief there|fore is founded in Evidence, and Evidence in NATURE. When this Evidence is &s;een, we a&s;&s;ent con&s;equently and nece&s;|&s;arily. But if NATURE cannot be compell'd, neither can &s;uch Belief. Force may produce Hypocri&s;y, or Simulation; Be|lief it cannot produce. And how can that therefore be deem'd fit to be done, which GOD has made impo&s;&s;ible to be done? It may be &s;aid, perhaps, that by a continual Effort even Impo&s;|&s;ibility may be &s;urmounted. I believe, (&s;aith St. AUSTIN) becau&s;e it is IMPOSSIBLE." This indeed is a &s;upernatural Rea|&s;on; he who can thus believe, may remove Mountains. The Mind thus &s;train'd becomes di&s;&s;olute. When Force is thus of|fer'd to it&s;elf, the Tran&s;ition is ea&s;y from the lowe&s;t Degree of &s;ervile Aba&s;ement to the highe&s;t Pitch of arrogant Pride. The Di&s;tance immediately vani&s;hes between IMPLICIT FAITH and arbitrary Command; and between arbitrary Command and per|&s;ecuting RAGE. In reality they concur, and run into each other. He who can believe with <HI>Au&s;tin</HI>, will damn with <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>. Such it &s;eems is the Genius of that FAITH, that who&s;oever believeth not, without Doubt he &s;hall peri&s;h everla&s;tingly." Is not this an amiable Picture of human NATURE; No: 'Tis a Picture only of prie&s;tly Genius. It is that very Genius which hath corrupted human NATURE. It is that very SERPENTINE Genius which MOSES &s;ymbolically characteriz'd, and which JESUS condemn'd. Our Poet hath de&s;crib'd it again l. 81&mdash;91. If it be truly de&s;ign'd, let them own it to whom it belongs. That Confe&s;&s;ion (more ju&s;t than ever St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> made) wou'd make even SHAME meritorious. Mean time I a&s;k leave to hope that a better Genius may prevail among tho&s;e, who are au|thoris'd to in&s;truct Mankind; and to wi&s;h, with a noble PHI|LOSOPHER,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LORD SHAFTESBURY.</NOTE> whom yet, while they hate, they vainly attempt to imitate; that
<Q>&startq;it may be far, and far &s;urely it will ever be, from any worthy Genius to be con&s;enting to &s;uch a treache|&endq;rous Language, and ABUSE of WORDS,</Q>
which makes Men hate each other for what they cannot under&s;tand, and builds FAITH on the De&s;truction of REASON and VIRTUE.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid that NATURE may be compell'd; This is an Appeal to the almighty Power of GOD, of which we can form no judgment but by Experience. But this Appeal implies either a great Fallacy, or an ab&s;olute Contradiction. It is a Contra|diction to &s;uppo&s;e the Supreme BEING acts again&s;t him&s;elf; &s;ince if Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s be Attributes, which are &s;uppos'd ne|ce&s;&s;ary to belong to him, &s;uch Action mu&s;t annihilate tho&s;e Attri|butes, or which is the &s;ame Thing with regard to us, mu&s;t render it impo&s;&s;ible for us to form any Conception, or Notion of them. Now the&s;e Propo&s;itions are equivalent: "NATURE is the WHOLE WORK of GOD," or "the WHOLE WORK of GOD is called NATURE." To deny this is ATHEISM; and to &s;uppo&s;e this WORK violated by the WORKER, if he be &s;uppos'd infi|nitely wi&s;e, good, and powerful, is to &s;uppo&s;e him acting again&s;t him&s;elf. But if the WORKER be perfect, nothing can be vio|lated. ALL IS RIGHT. What &s;eems to be wrong, is only in our&s;elves; and then only, when by following our own fond and chimerical Imaginations, we fal&s;ify his Operations, and at|tribute to him Things, which have no Connexion or Corre&s;pon|dence with NATURE. This Fal&s;ification of NATURE, or Sub|&s;titution of chimerical and &s;upernatural Notions, and Operations, in Place of real and NATURAL, ari&s;es either fir&s;t, from our Weakne&s;s in judging of natural Impre&s;&s;ions, and Matters of Fact, and afterwards in mi&s;taking the Effect, which tho&s;e Im|pre&s;&s;ions make on the Imagination, for the Things them&s;elves which cau&s;e them; from whence Super&s;tition is derived: or &s;econdly, from a wrong Direction, and Application of that Weak|ne&s;s, when the&s;e Seeds of Super&s;tition, are cultivated, and as they grow up, tran&s;planted into various Plots and Labyrinths, according to the Genius of tho&s;e, who in all ages have thought WORDS make VIRTUE, as WOOD makes a GROVE. And from hence tho&s;e Materials are &s;upplied, which have been u&s;ed in building the &s;everal Fabrics of artificial Religion; which, when it differs from NATURAL, (and it is always different in its Foun|dation, and often contrary to NATURAL RELIGION in its De|&s;ign) &s;o far co-operates with ATHEISM, that without Aid from the former, the very Notion of the latter cou'd NEVER have prevail'd, or forc'd it&s;elf on the IMAGINATION of Mankind.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides a Contradiction, the Appeal to Almighty Power concerning a Violation of NATURE, implies the greate&s;t Fal|lacy; &s;ince it &s;uppo&s;es that to be provable, which if it cou'd be prov'd, and were &s;o admitted and univer&s;ally employ'd, wou'd effectually de&s;troy the Foundation of all other Proof with Regard to every Thing NATURAL, or REAL. And this again wou'd throw us into ATHEISM.</P>
<P>All Inferences, or Conce&s;&s;ions drawn from Experience, Ha|bit, or Cu&s;tom, though they create A&s;&s;urance, and we u&s;ually think and act, as if they were certain, yet are only probable; becau&s;e we &s;ee not, nor can &s;ee in fact, the &s;ecret Principle which connects Cau&s;e and Effect.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See HUME Philo&s;oph. E&s;&s;.</NOTE> But Inferences from Rea&s;on are demon&s;trative: becau&s;e we &s;ee in the Relation of ab&s;tract Ideas, the nece&s;&s;ary Connexion of one Idea with another. In the latter Ca&s;e we conclude with Certainty from one In&s;tance, the Truth of all of the &s;ame Kind; in the former we conclude only with Probability from many In&s;tances that &s;imilar Cau&s;es will produce in Succe&s;&s;ion &s;imilar Effects. Cu&s;tom therefore, when con&s;ider'd with relation to external Things, is the continual, and regular Impre&s;&s;ion made upon our Sen&s;es by the Cour&s;e of NA|TURE; which, if it was irregular, incon&s;tant, or violable, there wou'd remain no Rule or Mea&s;ure of human Action. If the Ratio, or Order of NATURE were de&s;troy'd, the corre&s;pondent Ratios of the human Mind mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be de&s;troyed al&s;o, and it wou'd be ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for Man to become rational, civil, or religious. Without it he cou'd never become rational; for the Increments of human Rea&s;on being dervied from the Ra|tio of NATUE, which thro' the Sen&s;es by cu&s;tomary Progre&s;&s;ion im|prints Ideas on the Imagination, the Mind by ob&s;erving and retain|ing them, gradually acquires a Habit of applying them to the &s;everal U&s;es and Purpo&s;es of Life. But if the&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions were with|out Order, Agreement, or Connexion, that habitual or cu&s;tomary Perception or Belief, by which they are &s;o applied, cou'd not be excited. If Fire was experimentally &s;een to produce in alternate Turns, contrary Effects in the &s;ame Objects, it wou'd be im|po&s;&s;ible to render it u&s;eful, or &s;ub&s;ervient to the Wants of human Life. In like Manner, if the Behaviour of Man to Man pro|ceeded from &s;uch changeable and arbitrary Principles, all Peace, Order and Concord wou'd be &s;ubverted: he wou'd for ever re|main in a State of &s;avage Barbarity, and in a Condition much wor&s;e ev'n than Wolves and Bears. Legal therefore, or civil, Man cou'd not be. And religious he cou'd not be; &s;ince, hav|ing no Notion of a DEITY but what is formed from the Idea of his Works exhibited in Nature, and this Idea being imprinted on the Mind by a gradual Series, and progre&s;&s;ive Increment, by U&s;e and Cu&s;tom, becomes Belief; which again being regulated by Rea&s;on, confirms and e&s;tabli&s;hes the Notion of a SUPREME BEING, infinitely wi&s;e, good, and powerful. Hence al&s;o, by a Review, or Recognition of this Proce&s;s, he di&s;covers FAITH, LOYALTY and ALLEGIANCE to be a perfect Duty to this SU|PREME BEING, or the Perfection of his OWN. But if the Order of Things, and RATIO of NATURE did not generate and harmonize the progre&s;&s;ive Growth and Order of his own Na|ture, his Ideas wou'd be nothing but an infinite Number of Con|ceptions without Band, or Connexion; without Order or Pro|portion. In &s;uch Condition, Man cou'd acquire no Idea of Wi&s;dom and De&s;ign, no Sen&s;e or Feeling of Beauty, Virtue and Goodne&s;s; no Notion of a DEITY. Every Thing arbitrary, uncertain, and precarious. Hopele&s;s, comfortle&s;s, faithle&s;s, he wou'd wander for ever in a forlorn and fatherle&s;s World, hating, and hated; deceiving and deceived. Incapable of that calm and regular Happine&s;s, which flows from TRUTH and VIRTUE; with &s;udden Starts, perhaps, and tran&s;ient Fla&s;hes of Imagina|tion, which wou'd only di&s;cover the frightful Night, which &s;ur|rounded him, and in which he mu&s;t remain for ever &s;ubject to perpetual Fear, Horror and Amazement. Such would &s;eem to be the Condition of Man, and &s;uch the univer&s;al confu&s;ion which wou'd follow, if the regular Operations, and Con&s;titution of Things were violated; and &s;uch in Fact is his pre&s;ent Condi|tion in Proportion as Super&s;tition prevails, and he departs from NATURE. The Cour&s;e of NATURE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ip&s;a NATURAE RATIO, quae e&s;t LEX DIVINA &amp; HU|MANA. CIC.</NOTE> therefore is the GREAT STANDING REVELATION of the WILL or LAW of GOD. W$ cannot avoid the natural Impre&s;&s;ions of WILL or LAW, which by cu&s;tomary Succe&s;&s;ion create Belief: which is Nothing but a Progre&s;&s;ion of the Mind or Rea&s;on, corre&s;ponding with NA|TURE. Belief then is gradual, or cu&s;tomary In&s;tinct, or pro|gre&s;&s;ive Nature in Man, by which the Mind advances to the Knowledge of Truth, and Love of Virtue. It can neither be produced, nor prevented by any Forms of Rea&s;oning, or arti|ficial Method of Argumentation: neither can it be compell'd by Force; Force can only produce Simulation; and Rea&s;on can only direct and regulate this natural INSTINCT. And as this na|tural Progre&s;&s;ion is the &s;ame in all, as in each Man particularly, &s;o the Direction or Regulation is the &s;ame. Hence political, religious, and moral Regulations have all the &s;ame Source and Origin, the &s;ame Standard and common Mea&s;ure, in the Or|der, the Con&s;tancy, and Ratio of NATURE. The &s;ame cu&s;to|mary In&s;tinct, when review'd and recogniz'd, becomes CON|SCIENCE; which al&s;o, in Turn, when it becomes cu&s;tomary by the &s;ame Progre&s;&s;ion, becomes al&s;o a perfect LAW or Obli|gation. Hence it appears, that to e&s;tabli&s;h and pre&s;erve the Order and Peace of Society, it is not &s;ufficient that good Laws be written or taught, unle&s;s the &s;ame become cu&s;tomary. But if the Laws written or taught be bad, and do not corre&s;pond with NATURE, they may yet become cu&s;tomary, and &s;o prevail. And this is the Effect of natural INSTINCT wrong directed, and when it &s;upplies Craft with the Materials of Super&s;tition. This is the Source of that Pretence (for it is a Pretence only) that NATURE is corrupted. Thus NATURE is condemn'd for a Corruption introduc'd, habituated, and naturaliz'd, by the cu&s;tomary Influence and Prevalence of &s;uper&s;titious Sy&s;tems; while by a &s;trange Deception the nece&s;&s;ary U&s;e and Application of tho&s;e Sy&s;tems is proved, from that Corruption; and they are in Fact applied, or pretended to be applied, to correct, and cure that very Di&s;order which they produce.</P></NOTE>

But while in this Pur&s;uit they &s;toop to take up the gilded BALL of Profit, and Honour, Envy and Di&s;cord im|mediately ari&s;e, and prevail in Proportion to the Eagerne&s;s of Hope in gaining, or to the Violence of Fear in lo&s;ing tho&s;e dar|ling Objects: under the Deception and Inchantment of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, they are forcibly driven another Way; they depart from their fir&s;t Aim, and &s;oon lo&s;e &s;ight of Truth; while PRIDE a&s;&s;uming the Name of Zeal, by covering the Deception, &s;ancti|fies the Violence of Oppo&s;ition, and pretending to blow the Sparks of Truth, kindles the Flame of Per&s;ecution. This out|rageous Spirit of Bigotry, if it did not fir&s;t ari&s;e, undoubtedly receiv'd Growth, and Force from that metaphy&s;ical Jargon, and chimaerical Science, which the Heathen Sophi&s;ts introduc'd into the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion, deforming its Simplicity, and corrupting the Truth. The&s;e, on the Conver&s;ion of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI>, run like a Torrent into the fa&s;hionable Sy&s;tem, and brought with them all the mud, and filth of Heatheni&s;m. In this rich Glebe Weeds grew luxuriantly, and among the re&s;t, fal&s;e ZEAL acquir'd, now, &s;uch a poi&s;onous Quality, that it de&s;troy'd CHARITY, the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Part of that Religion, which it pretended to &s;upport. Thus it hath ever &s;ince continued to di&s;turb Mankind, from that Time to the pre&s;ent; with Fits however of Remi&s;&s;ion, and Abate|ment, in our own Country at lea&s;t, where it hath been check'd by the FREEDOM of WIT and HUMOUR: which, as our NO|BLE BRITISH PHILOSOPHER teaches, and by his Example &s;hews, hath proved the only &s;pecific Cure of religious Madne&s;s. We are pleas'd to &s;ee the Di&s;gui&s;e of Fal&s;hood removed, and we embrace Truth more &s;incerely, when the Deformity of Error is di&s;cover'd; while, as COMMON SENSE and EQUAL TASTE pre|vail, we tolerate with Ea&s;e, and even indulge in each other that Difference of Opinion which &s;eems unavoidable. The Hierarchy indeed are offended at this, and when they are not allowed to per&s;ecute, complain of Per&s;ecution.</NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P N="194">(194, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) If MIRACLES are requir'd in Proof of Truth; neither the pre&s;ent Ta&s;te of the Times, nor the watchful Cau|tion of the Hierarchy, will allow, it &s;eems, the Experiment; tho' &s;ome attempts, it mu&s;t be own'd, even in our own Country, and more, and greater Efforts, as might be expected, have been made in a neighbouring Nation, to re&s;tore this EYESIGHT PROOF. We mu&s;t recur therefore to former Times, more pro|per for &s;uch extraordinary Operations, and, as it &s;hould &s;eem, before the Order and Con&s;tancy of NATURE was under&s;tood. Here then we are guided only by Record, Report, or Tradition. But the Impre&s;&s;ions made by the&s;e Reports, being either con|trary to NATURE, or at lea&s;t not confirmed by the con&s;equent Order and Con&s;titution of Things, when it was afterwards ob|&s;erved to be more regular and con&s;tant, like Objects &s;een at a Di&s;tance, become gradually more weak by Time, and eva|ne&s;cent. On the other hand, natural Impre&s;&s;ions, or Matters of Fact, receive continual Increments from Repetition, and be|come by cu&s;tom more &s;trong, clear and vivid. To repair there|fore the gradual Decay, to which the former are &s;ubject, the Managers of Miracles have contrived, by frequent Repetitions, to give them Form, and Semblance at lea&s;t, if not the Sub|&s;tance, of real Facts. But in this Attempt, by bringing them too near the Sight, the Fallacy has been di&s;cover'd, and the Pur|po&s;e defeated, by tho&s;e very Means which were intended to e&s;ta|bli&s;h it. The wi&s;e&s;t therefore, and mo&s;t judicious of tho&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MIDDLETON, FREE ENQUIRY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> Ma|nagers, have corrected this Mi&s;take. They have retrench'd the Number of the&s;e &s;pecious, or artificial Miracles, limited the Times of Operation, and appropriated their Purpo&s;e, not to private, but to public Utility. And this &s;eems to be the only legitimate Purpo&s;e in which they can be properly employ'd. But even here too the greate&s;t Caution in u&s;ing them is nece&s;&s;ary, as they are much more apt to a&s;&s;ociate with Error and Vice, than with Truth and Virtue. They are indeed &s;o far from proving them&s;elves, and even from adding Strength by their A&s;&s;ociation to Truth and Virtue, that even their own Proof depends on the Worth and Value which they receive from that A&s;&s;ociation. Nothing then can be proved with them, but what mu&s;t be fir&s;t proved, and therefore better proved without them: &s;o that while we &s;ee their bad Influence in&s;en&s;ibly decay, and vani&s;h, we need be the le&s;s &s;ollicitous about lo&s;ing the good Effects, which &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed them capable of producing: and that (as the great ROMAN PHILOSOPHER ob&s;erves with his u&s;ual Sagacity)

This is the fiery Chariot, in which many a SAINT, PROPHET, or frantic ZEALOT, hath been carried to Heav'n. ZEAL with IMPLICIT FAITH is equally fitted to receive, or to inflict the Te&s;t of MARTYRDOM. Crouds with mo&s;t ardent Importunity have offered them&s;elves to this fiery Tryal of FAITH; while others in &s;ome Countries, ev'n at this Day, with equal Exta&s;y, behold it inflicted as a Puni&s;hment of INFIDELITY. A noble and lately flouri&s;hing City lies now in Ruins, which hath been a frequent Scene of this unnatural Joy; and what &s;eems indeed re|markable, the De&s;olation was poured out on that very Day, on which, according to annual Cu&s;tom, this inhuman TRAGEDY &s;hould have been acted. But GOD, the &s;upreme Conductor of the Machinery, and of the univer&s;al Sy&s;tem of NATURE, was plea&s;ed to change the Scene, and repre&s;ent a far different Spec|tacle, le&s;s horrible indeed than the other, but much more dread|ful and terrible! dreadful above the Power of De&s;cription; and terrible beyond the power of Imagination! and what now will the dogmatizing Zealot a&s;&s;ert concerning this va&s;t Cala|mity? he who pretends a Commi&s;&s;ion to under&s;tand, and to re|veal the SECRETS of PROVIDENCE? he who loves to turn Error into SIN, and De&s;truction into VENGEANCE? Was it a Puni&s;h|ment inflicted on ORTHODOXY, or on INFIDELITY? or &s;hall we rather affirm, with more Sobriety, and without affecting to know the SECRETS of PROVIDENCE, that in all Circum&s;tances, Benevolence is due from MAN to MAN, and in all Events perfect Submi&s;&s;ion and Re&s;ignation from MAN to his MAKER? Such Belief would check the Rage of ZEAL, when it kindles into Per|&s;ecution; and when it executes Vengeance on Man, in Pretence of executing the WILL of GOD.&mdash; Mean Time this ZEAL is found to agree very well with the greate&s;t VICE and WICKED|NESS. That royal SAINT, ADULTERER, and MURDERER, according to his own Account, was "devoured with ZEAL:" while, like NERO, he tuned his Harp, in&s;pired with Pa&s;&s;ions, which have &s;et the World on fire; his pious Hymns and &s;ancti|fied Execrations are promi&s;cuou&s;ly blended together, and too often, by modern Zealots, &s;ung with the &s;ame Intention.</NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(234.) This is an Allu&s;ion, as is u&s;ual with Poets, to the old Heatheni&s;h Story of PHAETON; he was a King, and reputed Son of PHOEBUS, or the SUN.

Here we &s;ee, as a learned Writer expre&s;&s;es it, a Concatenation of MIRACLES, deduced in a long Series, from
<Q>&startq;the Beginning to the pre&s;ent Time, ALL united in ONE POINT, which afford a Proof SIMILAR to THAT, which is deduced &endq;from NATURE to prove a DEITY.</Q>
The MIRACLES of NATURE do indeed prove a DEITY; but artificial MIRACLES have no other Effect, and perhaps no other Purpo&s;e, than to drive Men, either through De&s;pair, into Athei&s;m, or through Fear, into Super&s;tition. The latter Part of this is apparent; the former corre&s;ponds with a fine Reflection of Mr. <HI>Fontenelle</HI>: "We often find the Truth, but either don't know it; or can't prove that we have found it."
<Q>&startq;It is but too plain then (quoth the Impo&s;tor) that it was not made for us; and you'll &s;ee at la&s;t, People won't &s;o much as think of finding it. They'll lo&s;e &endq;their Courage and throw up the Game.</Q>
FONTENELLE DIALOGUES. The Papi&s;ts are not agreed in whom to place In|fallibility. Some, as the Je&s;uits, place it in the POPE; others in a General Council; others in the CHURCH. It mu&s;t be owned however, that if we view this papal Doctrine of Infalli|bility, as &s;oftened with the curious Pen of one of their greate&s;t Writers, it &s;eems very little different from that which prevails in every Sect of Prote&s;tants, who, if they are not infallible, yet are never deceived.<NOTE PLACE="marg">&rindx;</NOTE> The POPE allows no Enquiry, no Doubt. This is con&s;i&s;tent. The Prote&s;tant allows, encourages and even provokes Enquiry, yet condemns Doubt as impious.
<Q>&startq;When a Man depends either entirely on FAITH, as the PAPIST, or entirely on Rea&s;on, as the THEIST, it is ea&s;y to form a con|&s;i&s;tent Scheme of Doctrine.<NOTE PLACE="marg">&rindx;</NOTE> But when once he attempts to compound their different Powers, he pre&s;ently falls into Opi|nions, of which the &s;ole Contrariety is a manife&s;t Proof of their &endq;Fal&s;hood.</Q>
This is the Ob&s;ervation of that great Writer, above-mentioned, the famous Bi&s;hop of MEAUX; who&s;e Expo|&s;ition was &s;aid to have converted to Popery the great TURENNE. That illu&s;trious Prelate &s;aw very well the Incon&s;i&s;tency of ad|mitting REASON, as a Principle of NATURE, to co-operate with religious, political, or artificial FAITH, which wholly excludes NATURE. So then, it &s;eems, the Papi&s;t and the THEIST, each in his own Way, may both form a con&s;i&s;tent Scheme of Doctrine. The Con&s;i&s;tence of the former depends on AUTHO|RITY. It turns on a &s;ingle Point, Obedience to the CHURCH. The Con&s;i&s;tence of the latter is founded in NATURE. It is a cer|tain and nece&s;&s;ary Corre&s;pondence of SENSE, REASON and Ex|perience, with the certain and nece&s;&s;ary Order of Things. In the former, artificial Objects of Pa&s;&s;ion are &s;ub&s;tituted for natural; and on this Sub&s;titution the Calculation proceeds of all the &s;everal Orders and Proportions of this mighty Fabric. The&s;e Orders and Proportions being only apparent, or imaginary, ea&s;ily &s;lide into each other, and like the Vi&s;ions of a Dream, vani&s;h and di&s;appear; while from the &s;ame fruitful Source new Orders ari&s;e, and are again di&s;&s;olved with the &s;ame Ea&s;e, and without Ruin, or even Di&s;turbance.

<P>The Scheme of THEISM is that in Reality, which the Scheme of Papi&s;try is only in Appearance. In the latter the ART of Man a&s;&s;umes and exerci&s;es almighty Power and Infallibility; while ac|cording to the Nature of its Subject, which is merely imaginary, it arbitrarily and at Plea&s;ure, forms and unforms its &s;everal Or|ders, without the lea&s;t Di&s;turbance. In the latter, the Mind hath even a larger Scope, and Exerci&s;e, but in a different Way; for here it is wholly employed in ob&s;erving, in reporting, in re|cognizing the ART of GOD, exhibited in NATURE, or the SYSTEM of the UNIVERSE. The Sy&s;tem of THEISM therefore, is a Picture copied, or imitated, from NATURE. If then there be Con&s;i&s;tence in NATURE; If in the univer&s;al Frame and Sy|&s;tem of Things, there be Convenience, Beauty, and Grandeur; if in the Works of God there be Perfection; then the Sy&s;tem of THEISM is con&s;i&s;tent, convenient, beautiful, great and perfect.</P>
<P>FAITH, in the papal Scheme, being founded on Authority and Cu&s;tom, is implicit, pa&s;&s;ive, or merely verbal. There is no Contradiction perceived in $ropo&s;itions, which have no Reference to Things; or if perceived, it is verbal only; and then a verbal FAITH is &s;ufficient for a verbal Propo&s;ition. AUTHORITY, by exciting fal&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, begins the Circulation, Cu&s;tom receives it, and it gains, as a Lye gains Belief, by Repetition. On the other Hand, FAITH, according to the Sy&s;tem of THEISM, is indeed originally implicit, and pa&s;&s;ive, but not verbal. $t con|&s;i&s;ts in a Corre&s;pondence with NATURE; it is derived from natu|ral Impre&s;&s;ions, e&s;tabli&s;hed by Experience and Cu&s;tom; and in a gradual Progre&s;&s;ion being reviewed, and recognized by REASON, it becomes rational and free; while the Mind a&s;&s;ents willingly, and deliberately, without Reluctance, without Compul&s;ion, and without Authority. Rea&s;on indeed accrues from natural Im|pre&s;&s;ions, and cu&s;tomary Belief; which, in this Ca&s;e, is truly progre&s;&s;ive INSTINCT. It increa&s;es, as Rea&s;on with the Know|ledge of NATURE increa&s;es; and improves, and is capable of Improvement, in an endle&s;s Progre&s;&s;ion. If therefore Rea&s;on be u&s;eful in human Affairs, if it be mo&s;t u&s;eful in Things of mo&s;t Importance, and la&s;tly, if TRUTH, and VIRTUE, and RELI|GION, be indeed Things of mo&s;t Importance; then is FAITH according to the Sy&s;tem of THEISM, mo&s;t u&s;eful, mo&s;t rea&s;ona|ble, and mo&s;t important. It is adapted to all Men, at all Times; it in&s;inuates and ev'n forces it&s;elf on all Men, at all Times; and except only when di&s;turbed, or perverted, or counteracted by artificial Schemes of FAITH, and Sy&s;tems of Super&s;tition; it is embraced and followed by all Men, at all Times. It is the per|petual, continual and univer&s;al REVELATION of the WILL, or LAW of GOD, to all Men, at all Times, in different Degrees, and in a gradual Progre&s;&s;ion; &s;trong even before REASON acquires Maturity, but clear and more &s;trong when reviewed and recog|niz'd by REASON. This FAITH therefore MAY, and THIS alone CAN, be truly called CATHOLIC.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid above, that either in Popery, or in THEISM, a con&s;i&s;tent Scheme of FAITH may be formed. That Con&s;i&s;tency is now mark'd, and characteris'd. It was al&s;o &s;aid, that a Mix|ture, or Compo&s;ition of both, produces a Scheme incon&s;i&s;tent.&mdash; Of papal Faith mere WORDS or SOUNDS are the immediate, though the ultimate Object is Authority, or INFALLIBILITY; which indeed, without Force, wou'd be mere Words too.&mdash; Now in all other Ca&s;es, Men being accu&s;tom'd to affix &s;ome Meaning to Words, ev'n in the Expre&s;&s;ion of Pa&s;&s;ions, when the Idea and Perception are mo&s;t confus'd; the Imagination can ne|ver re&s;t, till it has try'd, in this Ca&s;e too, to fix &s;ome Meaning. From this Curio&s;ity it happens, that in all Sy&s;tems of Super&s;tition, Innovations and Reformations are gradualy formed, which, as they grow, either fall away, or are forced away, from the Pa|rent Stock. In the&s;e Reformations, TRUTH at fir&s;t &s;eems to be the only Thing de&s;igned; the Freedom of Rea&s;on is &s;ufficiently indulg'd; which goes as well, and as far as it can go, at a Time when it is but ju&s;t out of Dading-&s;trings. But the Prie&s;ts, when once they find them&s;elves &s;ettled, like a Hare in her Form, al|ways look backwards; always jealous, without Cau&s;e, of tho&s;e, who have mo&s;t Cau&s;e to be jealous of them, they &s;till fancy them&s;elves hunted and pur&s;ued; and think their only Safety con&s;i&s;ts in doubling back again into the &s;ame Track, and re|peating the &s;ame Ring <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Gyrum Rationis &amp; Doctrinae. <HI>CIC.</HI></NOTE>. All the Lines of their Hopes, of their De&s;igns, and of their Actions, center in that Point, where Licence was fir&s;t changed into Freedom, and REASON took the Seat of Authority; Rea&s;on therefore and Freedom they abhor, even when they pretend to indulge them; and they abhor becau&s;e they fear them. Nothing makes them &s;ecure but IN|FALLIBILITY; nothing agrees &s;o well with Infallibility as MY|STERY. Hence the Re&s;emblance of My&s;teries in all Sy&s;tems of Super&s;tition, and in all Changes, and Reformations of tho&s;e Sy&s;tems. This &s;trong Hold, however, has not always been un|der&s;tood; and not being under&s;tood, has &s;ometimes been be|tray'd, ev'n by the Prie&s;ts them&s;elves. It has been betray'd when they have attempted to explain, and to mea&s;ure by the Rule of Rea&s;on, Things which are inexplicable, and incommen&s;u|rable.</P>
<P>If a My&s;tery be &s;aid to be contained in certain Words, but not expre&s;&s;ed, or revealed, the Imagination fatigues and confounds it&s;elf to no Purpo&s;e in pur&s;uing a Hint which either points at NOTHING, or, which is the &s;ame, at Nothing which is the Object of human Under&s;tanding. Hence all that &s;trange Confu&s;ion in the Explica|tion of My&s;teries &s;uppo&s;ed, but not expre&s;&s;ed. But if, be&s;ides a My&s;tery, the Words al&s;o plainly imply a Contradiction; then Rea&s;on being clearly &s;een to be an improper Rule, or Mea&s;ure of My&s;tery, nothing can be &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h the latter, but IN|FALLIBILITY. But it is now too late to recur to Infallibility, which, by admiting Rea&s;on, had been before rejected. This In|con&s;i&s;tency belongs to tho&s;e, who, without pretending to Infalli|bility, admit the Co-operation of Rea&s;on with FAITH. It is indeed a great Incon&s;i&s;tency; for when a free Enquiry is per|mitted, and Examination allowed $f My&s;teries of FAITH; and when, as a Con&s;equence of &s;uch Enquiry, Di&s;&s;ent, in many Ca&s;es, &s;eems unavoidable; if yet that Di&s;&s;ent is deemed impious, in like Manner as when Infallibility exacts implicit Belief: what is this but to u&s;e, without pretending Infallibility, and to compell under Pretence of Freedom? What is this but to tempt, to be|tray, and even to in&s;ult Mankind, while they are invited to u&s;e their Rea&s;on freely, when yet they are puni&s;hed for that Free|dom? The De&s;ign, however, &s;eems originally to have been ge|nerous and humane, but perverted, as Religion hath always been perverted, by the Jealou&s;y of tho&s;e, who either fooli&s;hly fear that Men &s;hould know too much to be in&s;tructed; or who do not &s;ee that the Scheme of FAITH, which they have formed, is compo&s;ed of Parts, which de&s;troy each other, and that while they mix TRUTH with CHIMERAS, it re&s;embles that vi&s;ionary IMAGE <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DAN. ii.32.</NOTE> "who&s;e Head was of pure Gold, but the Feet were Clay."</P>
<P>Thus Infallibility is nece&s;&s;ary in all Sy&s;tems of Super&s;tition, to render the &s;everal Forms con&s;i&s;tent; but this Con&s;i&s;tency extends no farther than the Form it&s;elf, by which the Faithful are com|pelled, rather than united, with Regard to NATURE and COM|MON SENSE, the whole FORM remains incon&s;i&s;tent, notwith|&s;tanding; except only when &s;ometimes perhaps it may &s;eem to corre&s;pond with NATURE. The Sy&s;tem of THEISM can alone be perfectly con&s;i&s;tent, becau&s;e it perfectly corre&s;ponds with NA|TURE. The ONE re&s;ts on REAL INFALLIBILITY, the OTHER on PRETENDED; one is founded on the Authority of GOD, the other on the CRAFT of MAN; THEISM therefore is univer&s;al, it prevails more or le&s;s every where, and at all Times, wherever there are Creatures capable of perceiving and recognizing the Ef|fects of infinite Power, Wi&s;dom, and Goodne&s;s. The pre|tended Infallibility of artificial FAITH imitates al&s;o the&s;e Charac|ters, and p$oves, or attempts to prove, its Reality by Extent, and Duration. But if other precedent Sy&s;tems of Super&s;tition, of much larger Extent, and longer Duration have all failed, this Failure may &s;eem to render probable the Opinion that even this too may fail,

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P N="281">(281&mdash;9.) The Roman Empire was founded in Su|per&s;tition &s;upported by MIRACLES and PROPHECIES. In their religious Sy&s;tem, the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Doctrine of a future State was imitated and proved, as the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> proved it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE> by Fact: In this Contrivance a great Extent of Knowledge is vi|&s;ible. The Nature of Eclyp&s;es were then under&s;tood, and the Times calculated and applied, to excite Fear or Hope, Terror or A&s;&s;urance, as might be&s;t &s;erve the Purpo&s;es of mythological Legi&s;lature. On this Machinery <HI>Romulus</HI> was deified, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tempe&s;tas Soli&s;que Defectio Con&s;ecrationis Speciem praebu&eacute;re: cui mox Julius Proculus Fidem fecit. <HI>Flor.</HI></NOTE> the Go|vernment e&s;tabli&s;hed, and an Expectation rai&s;ed and cheri&s;hed of its eternal Duration. Hence VIRGIL, alluding to this Ex|pectation, calls the CAPITOL IMMOVEABLE:&mdash;CAPITOLI IMMOBILE SAXUM.</P>
<P>And our Poet here, who&s;e De&s;ign was, not to cheri&s;h, but to de&s;troy &s;uch fond Expectations, repre&s;ents that Eternity as a vain Dream, the Offspring of Super&s;tition and the Parent of Pride. The real MERIT of the Roman Genius and Di&s;cipline (which indeed was very great) con&s;i&s;ted in a Conformity with NATURE, as far as NATURE was then under&s;tood. COMMON SENSE was the Mea&s;ure of COMMON GOOD; and Super&s;tition was employ'd to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; It was, however, always &s;ub&s;ervient, not &s;upreme; becau&s;e, as VARRO &s;ays,
<Q>&startq;the State exi&s;ted before &endq;the &s;everal Deities were in&s;tituted.</Q>
<Q>&startq;Quia Civitates Diis, &endq;quos ip&s;ae in&s;tituerant, ut Pictor Tabell&acirc;, priores &s;unt.</Q>
This Method, which rendered Super&s;tition &s;ub&s;ervient to the State, gave Room and Freedom to human Nature to exert it&s;elf. Ac|cordingly the <HI>Romans</HI> were remarkable for Simplicity of Manners, for Frugality, Sobriety, Temperance, Fortitude, and for every Virtue private or public, u&s;eful or ornamental. The&s;e Virtues really made them great; but Super&s;tition corrupted that Great|ne&s;s, by &s;welling it into Pride, and an unnatural Lu&s;t of Domi|nion. Thus, by depriving others of Liberty, they lo&s;t their own. Luxury followed Conque&s;t, and Vice followed Luxury, while Super&s;tition by the&s;e Means, became predominant, and in&s;tead of being &s;ub&s;ervient to the State, the State was &s;ub|&s;ervient to Super&s;tition. And NOW Vice, which in other Cir|cum&s;tances, is only a Start or Deviation from NATURE, in this Conjuncture, and under the Influence of Super&s;tition, became ge|neral, habitual, and, as it were, naturaliz'd.</P></NOTE>

This Fable is ingeniou&s;ly invented. The Meaning extends far. Time it &s;eems had devoured all the fal&s;e Idols of Deity, which Super&s;tition had rai&s;ed, and (according to our Poet) TIME will devour ALL which &s;hall be rai&s;ed on the &s;ame Foundation.

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P N="346">(346.) Having &s;hewn the Weakne&s;s of IMPLICIT FAITH, and Super&s;tition, the Que&s;tion here ri&s;ing from that Di&s;covery is very proper, and equally important:
<Q>&startq;Why &s;hould Men hate, vilify, and per&s;ecute each other for Difference of Opinion, in Things, which have no Certainty, nor even Exi&s;tence in &endq;Truth and NATURE,</Q>
but only in the di&s;ordered Imagination "of tho&s;e, who (as our Poet before noted l. 145.)</P>
<Q><L>"Hug their own DAY-DREAMS IDOLISED WITHIN,</L>
<L>And &s;tyle them REVELATION?</L></Q>
<P>And indeed according to our noble PHILOSOPHER, unle&s;s we are capable of viewing and reviewing, on all Sides, and in every Light, our Fancies and Imaginations, and of judging and criti|ci&s;ing them with a clear and free Mind, we can never be &s;ure of their TRUTH, REALITY, or CONFORMITY with NATURE.
<Q>&startq;They may, perhaps, be MONSTERS, and not DIVINITIES, or SACRED TRUTHS, which are kept thus choicely con&s;e|&endq;crated in &s;ome dark Corner of the Mind.</Q>
This &s;olemn Con|&s;ecration of chimerical Notions is the great Source of BIGOTRY, and e&s;pecially, when by &s;uch WILL-WORSHIP, and blind Ido|latry, men attribute, a&s;&s;ume, or impute to them&s;elves REAL MERIT: this Deception working and fermenting with Vanity and Vice, rai&s;es an exce&s;&s;ive and unnatural PRIDE, or &s;piritual Arrogance, which, by rejecting and di&s;daining COMMON SENSE, GOOD-WILL and GOOD-HUMOUR, renders them intolerable to each other. VIRTUE is hated and virtuous Men per&s;ecuted, ac|cording as they differ, or are &s;uppo&s;ed to differ, from certain FORMS of CREEDS, or SYMBOLS of FAITH. This Hatred of Virtue is &s;trangely contra&s;ted; Men become vicious out of Spite; while Pride, growing with Vice, by Means of imputed Merit, prompts them to indulge, under all this Deception, a fond HOPE of attaining Happine&s;s in a miraculous or &s;upernatural Way, and as our Poet has &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed it,
<Q>&mdash;"Affect ev'n HEAV'N in SPITE."</Q>
Till at la&s;t, Virtue and Vice lo&s;ing their Di&s;tinction, they re&s;t in the latter as mo&s;t agreeable to NATURE, though it be indeed mo&s;t contrary to NATURE, and to the LAWS of GOD, which have this authentic Property, that they execute them&s;elves. Hence it happens, that in this Pur&s;uit of chimerical Happine&s;s Men always find them&s;elves di&s;appointed.
<Q><L>&mdash;"ALL IS VANITY.</L>
<L>"MEN NEVER ARE, but always TO BE BLEST."</L></Q>
And hence al&s;o is derived another Ob&s;ervation of Fact, which would cea&s;e to be true, if Super&s;tition and Bigotry were removed,
<Q>&startq;That even with the Aid of Religion human Nature grows daily more corrupt: &s;o hard it is in any State to find a MAN, who &endq;lives NATURALLY, and like a MAN.</Q></P></NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="foot">(368.) And here it &s;hould &s;eem probable, that they, who LIVE WELL BELIEVE WELL, and that VIRTUE in Practice is a Mark of TRUTH in Opinion.</NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P N="373">(373.) Yet this Proof, in Fact, is in&s;ufficient. For though in Reality TRUTH and VIRTUE coincide, and mutually fit, or tally with each other, yet they are not the &s;ame. Truth is the Conformity of our Perceptions, Ideas and Notions with NATURE: Virtue is the Conformity of our Affections with NATURE. Their Difference therefore ari&s;es from the different Powers, or Fa|culties, from which they are derived. The Sources of the for|mer are in the Under&s;tanding, of the latter in the WILL. The Under&s;tanding is improved two Ways; by NATURE and by ART. The fir&s;t proceeds by Experience and Cu&s;tom, from which REASON advances by a gradual Progre&s;&s;ion; the &s;econd by In&s;truction and Di&s;cipline. In both the&s;e Ways, when the Proce&s;s is regular, and according to NATURE, the Mind, either by this &s;ingle, or united Influence, acquires TRUTH; and the Affections, following the &s;ame Order, corre&s;pond, or harmonize, with NATURE, and become virtuous and right. In this Ca&s;e therefore the Proofs of Truth and Virtue are reciprocal; true Opinion would infer virtuous Action, and virtuous Action would prove true Opinion. In this Proce&s;s NATURE &s;eldom deviates; but Di&s;cipline and In&s;truction often counteract NATURE, accord|ing to that Maxim of antient PHILOSOPHY: <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HIEROCLES.</NOTE>. When this happens either through Mi&s;take or De&s;ign, the Opinions derived from it become fal&s;e, or fanta&s;tical, and the Affections, following the &s;ame Directions, become unnatural and vicious; and this always happens in &s;ome Degree proportionable to the Prevalence of Super&s;tition, on which &s;uch Di&s;cipline and In&s;truction is founded. Neverthe|le&s;s, as Super&s;tition allows, licences, or indulges Truth and Virtue within certain Bounds, or limits, &s;o far as the GRANT extends, they mutually prove each other, but no farther. Beyond the Limits of the GRANT, TRUTH and VIRTUE become negative Terms, or Signs, which de&s;troy them&s;elves. Thus, if Opinion or FAITH be contrary to the Religious GRANT, or Licence, VIRTUE immediately changes, and becomes VICE, while VICE a&s;&s;umes the NAME and PRAISE of VIRTUE in the orthodox Believer, who&s;e FAITH is fa&s;hion'd RITELY, and according to the GRANT or LICENCE. This however is ALL, which Super&s;tition or artificial Religion can effect by this Magical Notation. It can only change the NAME; not the THING. VIRTUE, and VICE &s;till ARE, AS THEY ARE; the LAWS of GOD execute them&s;elves notwith&s;tanding: Tho' the Impo&s;ition of a fal&s;e Title has been employed to procure a general Condem|nation, while Mankind are doom'd to &s;uffer Death as the puni&s;h|ment of a voluntary Crime, which is only a nece&s;&s;ary Condition of their Exi&s;tence.</P>
<Q>&mdash;FALSO DAMNATI CRIMINE MORTIS.</Q>
<P>The illu&s;trious Mr. FENELON, Archbi&s;hop and DUKE of CAMBRAY, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See his Life by RAMSAY, <HI>p.</HI> 341-2.</NOTE> equally famous for Learning, Fine Ta&s;te, and Virtue, &s;ays,
<Q>&startq;There are properly &s;peaking but TWO ARTI|CLES of Religion, THE LOVE OF GOD, AND OBEDIENCE &endq;TO THE CHURCH.</Q>
But JESUS CHRIST, without mentioning the CHURCH, had before recognis'd only TWO ARTICLES of Religion; "THE LOVE OF GOD, and THE LOVE OF MAN." In this FAITH the Agreement with TRUTH and NATURE is perfect; in the other Repugnance, and ev'n Contrariety are po&s;&s;ible. The LAW OF GOD, or NATURE obliges us to &s;ee, and own a Difference between BLACK and WHITE, BITTER and SWEET, VICE and VIRTUE: But when the CHURCH commands, every Believer who is initiated, inli&s;ted, and inroll'd, is obliged to &s;ee and own that BLACK is WHITE, that BITTER is SWEET, and that VICE is VIRTUE. For thus the Religious Accountant calculates, according to his artificial Method of Notation:
<Q>&startq;MORE TRUTH and VIRTUE added to LESS FAITH, the Sum is LESS MERIT or WICKEDNESS; and LESS TRUTH and VIRTUE added to MORE FAITH, the Sum &endq;is MORE MERIT or RIGHTEOUSNESS.</Q>
And thus the Fol|lowers of &s;uch artificial Religion often find them&s;elves obliged to HATE MAN, whom they HAVE SEEN, under Pretence of LOV|ING GOD, whom they HAVE NOT SEEN, and according to this Method, whom they NEVER CAN SEE. But this is the com|mon and ev'n nece&s;&s;ary Effect of CHURCH DISCIPLINE and IMPLICIT FAITH, or BLIND OBEDIENCE, when they counter|act NATURE and the LAW of GOD! Neverthele&s;s, the GOOD Archbi&s;hop, in the mid&s;t of contrary and oppo&s;ite At|tractions, always pre&s;erved the INTEGRITY and &s;pecific IDEN|TITY of TRUE MANHOOD, by exerci&s;ing univer&s;al LOVE and BENEVOLENCE to ALL MEN, and kept his FAITH, LOYALTY and ALLEGIANCE to GOD entire, tho' &s;worn to ANOTHER MASTER. Thus it appears the good Man's Deed doth not always, and nece&s;&s;arily prove the Truth of his Belief; &s;ince, when it extends beyond the Limits allow'd, that Connexion is broken, and the Deed becomes cogni&s;able only in the Court of CONSCIENCE, and according to the LAW of NATURE, in which TRUTH and VIRTUE perfectly coincide. The&s;e &s;ingular ap|pearances, and Characters of the Exce&s;s, or Superiority of GOODNESS above TRUTH, are noted by a noble Writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LORD DIGBY. Letters to Sir K. DIGBY.</NOTE>, who ob&s;erves, that
<Q>&startq;GOODNESS many times delights the Soul, in &s;pite of TRUTH, and &s;o proves a TRANSCENDENT above &endq;it,</Q>
or as PROCLUS: <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</P>
<P>But this Tran&s;cendence of Goodne&s;s is rare; the contrary Effect is much more common. In great Souls the Native Force, or INSTINCT of Goodne&s;s is &s;o predominant, that ev'n in the mo&s;t unfavourable Circum&s;tances, and under the Influence of the wor&s;t In&s;titutions, it operates and prevails again&s;t all oppo&s;ition. In this Ca&s;e, it is the Effect of a great Genius only, that Good|ne&s;s &s;eems to operate IN SPITE of TRUTH; while others under the &s;ame Influence of Super&s;tition are MALEVOLENT in SPITE of TRUTH. This contrary Effect of the &s;ame Cau&s;e de&s;erves Ex|planation, as the CONTRAST is con&s;picuous, and exhibits a moral Picture with the deepe&s;t Shades and &s;tronge&s;t Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid above, that the Effect of Super&s;tition in cor|rupting the MORAL SENSE and NATURAL Affection, is NE|CESSARY. This is certainly &s;o, when the Sy&s;tem of Super&s;tition, as there &s;uppo&s;ed, is received with IMPLICIT FAITH. But in the Good Man, who alone can be properly called the truly GREAT, or HAPPY Genius, this Oppo&s;ition between TRUTH and VIRTUE, and the Tran&s;cendency, or Superiority of the latter above the former, is Apparent only, not Real. He &s;oars above the Clouds of Super&s;tition, which do not hinder him from moving, but only conceal his Motives. He overlooks the dim Pro&s;pects of IMPLICIT FAITH; to him tho&s;e Minutene&s;&s;es va|ni&s;h, and become invi&s;ible Points: He believes, and &s;ees, and feels as Things are, truly, and according to NATURE: He is benevolent from In&s;tinct, TASTE, or Temper, improv'd, and matur'd by Rea&s;on and Experience. He knows that TRUTH only can make us FREE; and tho' perhaps he doth not always &s;peak, yet he always thinks and acts FREELY. Thus far, but no farther, a wi&s;e and good Man may &s;ubmit to the Tyranny of Super&s;tition. On the other hand, the very Capacity of perceiving Truth excites Malevolence and hatred in a bad Temper, again&s;t tho&s;e e&s;pecially, who think and &s;peak, and act FREELY. This Freedom is not applicable to Vice, or Licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s; which is indeed real Slavery; as it gives the Temper a Bia&s;s contrary to NATURE. It is a Freedom from the Bondage of Super&s;tition; which Bondage coincides with Vice. For as Vice con&s;i&s;ts in a &s;ort of a Serpentine KNOT, or Intertwining of wrong Opinion, wrong Affection, and wrong Action, which run into each other; &s;o this Knot in mo&s;t Ca&s;es is tied, and in all drawn fa&s;ter, and clo&s;er, by the Force of Super&s;tition. The Freedom therefore, which is derived from Truth, is an harmonious Corre&s;pondence, or Symphoni&s;ing with NATURE thro' all the Powers or Faculties of the Mind; which accord|ing to a certain Growth, or progre&s;&s;ive Improvement of REASON, being review'd, and recognis'd, become the Sources of right Opinions, of natural Affections, and of rea&s;onable Action. This produces a perfect Con&s;i&s;tency, and Agreement in the Mind, when the Imagination, the Will, and the Judgment act in Concord and Harmony with each other; from which Con|cord ari&s;es that Peace, Security and Acquie&s;cence in the Order of Providence, which is both the Effect and Reward of VIRTUE, and is a State of perfect FREEDOM. This is the Summit, or highe&s;t Point of human Perfection and Happine&s;s; and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, as we &s;ee in fact it doth, produce Envy and Hatred in tho&s;e, who at the &s;ame time &s;ee it attain'd by others, and feel their own Inability of attaining it. Now tho' all Men, the Poor as well as the Rich, the Ignorant and the Wi&s;e, have the Ability of attaining it, and do indeed naturally tend to this Point, yet that Tendency is perverted, in &s;ome by the Predo|minance of &s;ome particular Pa&s;&s;ion, and in all by the Prevalence of Super&s;tition, which gives Force and Malignity to every Pa&s;&s;ion. When a Man is thus trammel'd, he is compell'd to draw. He frets; he rages; yet de&s;erves to be pitied, ev'n when mo&s;t outrageous. And he wou'd well de&s;erve it, if that Rage only hurt him&s;elf, and if it were not often directed again&s;t the Innocent and Virtuous. Then what Di&s;gui&s;ements! What Struggles! What Di&s;tortions! to conceal his Pain; to di&s;&s;emble Truth; to recommend Fal&s;hood? Genius, Knowledge, Learn|ing, if they are not &s;trong enough to counteract the Venom, always render it more Powerful and Malignant. If a Writer; the Poi&s;on, not of A&s;ps, but of the mad Dog "is under his Lips." He &s;naps and bites at all he meets. He is reduced at la&s;t to the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t abject State of Slavery; to &s;ee Truth, which he dares not own, and to commend Virtue, which he cannot practice. He therefore hates FREE-THINKING; becau&s;e "it belongs to a FREE MAN only to &s;peak TRUTH." <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. MENANDER.</P></NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="foot">(373.) Thus the Proof of Truth from Virtue is &s;ufficient. But if the Argument be converted, and Fal&s;e FAITH be inferr'd from vicious Action, here it &s;eems to prove too much; &s;ince it proves the fal&s;hood ev'n of the mo&s;t orthodox Chri&s;tian FAITH. &mdash;It mu&s;t be own'd however that this Exce&s;s of Proof is only apparent, and in this particular Ca&s;e; for all Vice is owing to fal&s;e Opinion, either implicit, or explicit, or el&s;e to unnatural Affection, or Pa&s;&s;ion, derived from fal&s;e Opinion.&mdash;Our Poet u&s;es the Argument ad Hominem; and the Chri&s;tians, here characteris'd, are not REAL, but only NOMINAL.</NOTE>

<Q>&startq;The &endq;FATHERS</Q>
(as they are called)
<Q>&startq;are &s;aid &s;ometimes to have mention'd the Earthquake which defeated the Attempt of JULIAN in rebuilding the Temple at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>, only to &s;up|port &s;ome favourite Point of Doctrine. So AMBROSE, it &s;eems, urged this Miracle to THEODOSIUS, to confirm the &endq;important Doctrine of Per&s;ecution.</Q>
It was well (&s;ays a certain great CHAMPION of IMPLICIT FAITH, from whom this Account is taken;) it was
<Q>&startq;WELL THIS MIRACLE was &endq;performed by GOD, to DO HONOUR to HIMSELF.</Q>
for if it had been performed to do HONOUR to the Bi&s;hops of the CHURCH, they &s;eem not to have de&s;erved it; &s;ince one of them excited his Flock, (poor Lambs!) to burn a <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Synagogue. The Fact was ju&s;tified by AMBROSE, on the Authority of this Miracle, with a mode&s;t HINT to THEODOSIUS, "TO REMEMBER THE FATE OF JULIAN." Now what may be &s;uppos'd to be the Cau&s;e of the good FATHER'S Zeal? Why, Complaint being made to THEODOSIUS, that the Chri&s;tians, by In&s;tigation of their Bi&s;hop, had burnt a <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Synagogue, the Emperor puni&s;hed their outrageous Violence, and decreed the Prelate to rebuild the CHURCH or TEMPLE, at his OWN EXPENCE. This mild Decree may &s;eem, per|haps partiality to the Bi&s;hop, rather than Ju&s;tice to the Injur'd: Yet the good Bi&s;hop, (it &s;eems) was offended; the good FATHER too was offended; ALL PRIESTS are offended; and, as if it was a mere Train of Gunpowder, the Re&s;entment catches from one End of the HIERARCHY to the other. Nay ev'n our CHAMPION him&s;elf, Friend as he is of TRUTH and LIBERTY, &s;eems offended: For (&s;ays he)
<Q>&startq;THE IMPIETY &endq;OF THIS SENTENCE OFFENDED AMBROSE.</Q>
But the &s;ame accurate Writer &s;ays al&s;o, that THEODOSIUS by this Decree "SUPPORTED THE NATURAL RIGHTS of MAN|KIND." How then cou'd the DECREE be IMPIOUS? But the learned Writer's Argument is wonderfully contra&s;ted; for JULIAN (he &s;ays) VIOLATED tho&s;e &s;ame NATURAL RIGHTS with IMPIETY, which THEODOSIUS with IMPIETY SUPPORTED. The latter is Impious becau&s;e he puni&s;h'd the mo&s;t outrageous Violation of NATURAL RIGHT; and the former, becau&s;e he puni&s;h'd no religious SECT, but tolerated both CHRISTIAN and JEW; whom he exhorted to exerci&s;e their Religion peaceably, and only hinder'd them from per&s;ecuting each other. But this Toleration, it &s;eems, was a Violation of the&s;e NATURAL RIGHTS which are &s;upported by Toleration; or in plain Words, this TOLERATION was INTOLERATION. To allow the free Ex|erci&s;e of a Religion in&s;tituted by GOD him&s;elf (as this Writer may be &s;uppo&s;ed to believe) was Per&s;ecution; and to rebuild a Temple, of which the very Form, and Model, as well as the Wor&s;hip, was appointed by GOD, and intended, and declar'd by that Appointment to la&s;t for EVER, was IMPIOUS RE|BELLION again&s;t the SAME GOD, who al&s;o became his OWN SON in order not to de&s;troy, but to fulfill his OWN WILL.
<Q>&startq;But (he adds very ju&s;tly) it has always been the TRICK, and has often prov'd the FOLLY, of INTOLERANTS to place their mi&s;erable Principles on &s;uch Foundations, as are &endq;found mo&s;t of all to di&s;credit it.</Q>
Whether this learned THEO|LOGIST be a TOLERANT, or INTOLERANT, doth not plainly appear, while under the Magic of his wonder-working Art, and with a &s;ort of wanton Protervity, he thus changes and transforms at Plea&s;ure the FACE of NATURE, as well as his OWN.
<Q>ET VULTUS NIMIUM LUBRICUS ASPICI.</Q>
Meantime we may be allow'd, peradventure, to gue&s;s &s;ome mi|&s;erable Principle lies ob&s;curely lurking between tho&s;e two Ex|tremes of Tolerance and Intolerance, of Chri&s;tian CHARITY, and Prie&s;tly BIGOTRY. Is it DULLNESS, or SOPHISTRY, or FREE-THINKING? The ingenious Gentleman, it is pre&s;umed, will choo&s;e the &s;econd; for he loves WIT it &s;eems, yet hates FREE-THINKING. And thus having ONCE reduced this PROTEUS to his original SERPENTINE FORM, he may now employ him&s;elf accord|ing to his Kind, in licking the Du&s;t of old Tombs and con&s;e|crated Bones, and in feeding on the Reliques of &s;epulchral Su|per&s;tition.

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P N="383-4">(383-4.) We have &s;een above (Note l. 360.) that one Effect of IMPLICIT FAITH and Super&s;tition, is to change VIRTUE into VICE, and in the la&s;t Note, we have &s;een an Example of it. This indeed, in our own Country, and at this Time, may &s;eem &s;trange; but once there was a Time when this Effect was more common, and almo&s;t univer&s;al. That Time our Poet calls,
<Q>&mdash;the dead NIGHT of FAITH.</Q>
When ev'n the mo&s;t active Pa&s;&s;ions became &s;ilent, Men were then in general too li&s;tle&s;s to affect ev'n SAINTSHIP, while the few who indulged that Vanity were di&s;appointed. And as that is the Meridian of TRUTH and VIRTUE, in which <HI>Pope</HI> has fix'd the Height of human Felicity;
<Q>"The ONLY POINT where HUMAN BLISS STANDS STILL.'</Q>
So this was the oppo&s;ite Point, or MIDNIGHT of Error and Vice, and con&s;equently, of Mi&s;ery and Wretchedne&s;s. And here one is tempted to wi&s;h that in this long Night BIGOTRY had &s;lept for ever. But it always ri&s;es again at the DAWN of TRUTH, while as this advances, ENVY and SPITE attend its Progre&s;s, and Zeal and Per&s;ecution kindle their Flames at the LIGHT of HEAVEN. It is either in the Moonlight of Super&s;tition, or in the Dawn of Knowledge, when the&s;e mon&s;trous FORMS appear mo&s;t terrible. Then it is, that jealous of the Growth of REA|SON, and prevalence of TRUTH, the Managers of Super&s;tition, under Pretence of re&s;training Here&s;y, Infidelity and Athei&s;m, would willingly re&s;traing al&s;o all FREE THOUGHT. With this Intention, their Di&s;cipline is extended to that early Age and weak State of human NATURE, which is incapable of Choice and Judgment. Here they lay the Foundation of IMPLICIT FAITH; here they lay their Leaven, their Poi&s;on, the vermi|cular Egg, which grows with Nature, and like a worm in the Bud, con&s;umes or corrupts the future Fruit; while even INFANTS are li&s;ted and &s;worn by Proxy into a CREED,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&lindx;</NOTE> and marked with an invi&s;ible SIGN, without which they are deemed unqualified for &s;ocial Duties, and incapable of Happine&s;s. So al&s;o the pure&s;t and mo&s;t &s;incere Virtue, without a Licence, or TICKET from the Prie&s;t, is excommunicated from the Favour of GOD and MAN, while Vice, it &s;eems, with that Pa&s;&s;port, is duly quali|fied to receive both.</P>
<P>There happened, it is &s;aid, a great Quarrel between the cele|brated Mr. PRIOR and Dr. ATTERBUY, DEAN of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> and Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>. They were walking together in the Abby, when an Occa&s;ion offered which produced the following Ver&s;es, <HI>ex tempore:</HI>
<Q><L>"As the Verger came up to the Bi&s;hop he &s;aid,</L>
<L>"The Go&s;&s;ips are ready, the Cu&s;hions are laid:</L>
<L>"What! without my Con&s;ent, quoth the Bi&s;hop, inflamed,</L>
<L>"Go; &s;hut up the Font: LET THE INFANT BE DAMN'D.</L></Q>
The Poet, we &s;ee, very freely, and very ju&s;tly ridicules a Doc|trine, prie&s;tly indeed, but not Chri&s;tian, and equally CRUEL and CHIMERICAL. This illu&s;trious Prelate, it &s;eems, was a Reali&s;t in this Doctrine, though not in VIRTUE;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Sermon on 1 CORINTH. iv.19. and the Preface, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> he could not bear a je&s;t on &s;o &s;erious a Subject as Damnation: which, if &s;uch Wit was allowed, would be denounced only again&s;t the Vicious, not again&s;t the Innocent and Virtuous. This would neither be agreeable to the Will, nor favourable to the Authority of tho&s;e, who, for the Good of Mankind, a&s;&s;ume the Power to damn or &s;ave. So the Bi&s;hop's Re&s;entment was everla&s;ting; and well it might, for the Ridicule here has all the Edge of WIT, and all the Weight of TRUTH, which no Mortal can bear, who, like the Bi&s;hop, has WIT without TRUTH, and nothing but the Armour of Super&s;tition to defend him: though this, it mu&s;t be owned, may &s;ometimes &s;ave the Champion from being hit, as, in HOMER, the HERO was &s;aved by the Inter|po&s;ition of a Cloud <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Iliad iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Another Way, in which Super&s;tition $al&s;ifies the LAWS of GOD, and a&s;&s;umes the Power of Damnation, or (which is the &s;ame) of Excommunication, is in the Ca&s;e of FORNICATION. Here in the Interpretation of a Word, it often happens that the Law of NATURE, or Commandment of GOD is turned into a CRIME. Now the Law of NATURE, re&s;pecting the UNION of the Sexes in human Kind, is plainly this, That they be mu|tually faithful to each other. This in the papal Scheme of Re|ligion is called a SACRAMENT; and it is truly &s;o called: being a Covenant or Oath of mutual Allegiance or Fidelity, of which GOD above and Con&s;cience can be Witne&s;&s;es. The Force or Ob|ligation of this Covenant is founded in the Con&s;titution of the hu|man Mind, which being endued with great Sen&s;ibility with regard to the Cau&s;es, or Motives of Love, and E&s;teem, is rendered capa|ble of greater Degrees of Plea&s;ure or Pain, of Happine&s;s or Mi|&s;ery, on this Account, than perhaps any other. This Sen&s;ibility is always &s;een more pure and &s;imple, and therefore more delicate and refined, in Proportion as following NATURE backward we view Man in his original State, before he was corrupted by ar|tificial In&s;titutions, and arbitrary Re&s;traints. This original Sen|&s;ibility is wonderfully expre&s;s'd in MILTON. This is one of tho&s;e univer&s;al Beauties in that divine Poet, which being founded in NATURE, not in CHIMAERA would de&s;erve and gain the unanimous Admiration of Mankind.
<Q>&startq;It is ob&s;ervable (&s;ays Mr. VOLTAIRE) that in all other Poems Love is repre&s;ented as a VICE, in MILTON only it is a Virtue. The Pictures he draws of it are naked, as the Per&s;ons of whom he &s;peaks and &endq;as venerable.</Q>
He removes with a cha&s;t Hand the Veil,
<Q>&startq;which covers every where el&s;e the Enjoyments of that Pa&s;&s;ion&punc; There is Softne&s;s, Tenderne&s;s, and Warmth, without La&s;ci|viou&s;ne&s;s. The Poet tran&s;ports us into that State of Innocence and Happine&s;s, in which ADAM and EVE continued for a &s;hort Time; he &s;oars not above human, but above corrupt Nature; and as there is no In&s;tance of &s;uch Love, there is none of &s;uch &endq;Poetry.</Q>
Such is the De&s;cription of a Pa&s;&s;ion, which is the Origin of Society; and if there be indeed few who are capable of conceiving or expre&s;&s;ing it in its original Purity and Simplicity, it is becau&s;e they draw not from the Fountain, but from certain Re&s;ervoirs, which become &s;tagnant and impure with the Mud and Filth of Super&s;tition. The INDIANS, both Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern, were remarkable for their conjugal Fidelity, before they were corrupted by their Intercour&s;e with the <HI>Europeans</HI>; &s;o that it appears to be a natural In&s;tinct implanted in Man by the Deity as the Source of &s;ocial Happine&s;s. Such then is the Law of NATURE concerning the Union of the Sexes, &s;o clearly, &s;o &s;trongly, and &s;o univer&s;ally felt, that it may &s;eem not only ab|&s;urd, but even impious in any Order of Men to a&s;&s;ume an Autho|rity to grant Licence of doing that, which contains in it&s;elf the Force of a natural or divine Law and Obligation. It is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e Leave or Licence is nece&s;&s;ary to perform or fulfill a per|fect Right, and Duty; and it is impious to &s;uppo&s;e a Power of Prohibition exi&s;ts again&s;t a Duty, which if prohibited, Mankind could not exi&s;t. But where there is a Power to permit, there is a Power al&s;o to prohibit; neither of which can be properly ap|plied in Duties, but only in Things indifferent, or criminal. NATURE in this Ca&s;e is the only Security; and it ari&s;es from fal&s;e Policy, and the bu&s;y Interpo&s;ition of Prie&s;ts, who are al|ways cro&s;&s;ing the Purpo&s;es of NATURE, and PROVIDENCE, that of all Parts of the World, the <HI>European</HI> Nations are the mo&s;t di&s;|&s;olute and incontinent; and from this particular Corruption, which now is become general, ari&s;es many other Corruptions. The very Name of MATRIMONY includes all the Relations of FATHER, and MOTHER, of HUSBAND and WIFE, of CHIL|DREN, of BROTHER, and SISTER; and of all the familiar CHA|RITIES, and &s;ocial Friend&s;hips, which ari&s;e from cu&s;tomary Ne|ce&s;&s;itude. This is the fir&s;t Link in that Chain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prima Societas in ip&s;o e&s;t Conjugio. Id autem e&s;t Princi|pium Urbis, &amp; qua&s;i Seminarum Reipub. CIC.</NOTE> which holds to|gether civil Society, which if it be broken by Incontinence and Infidelity, the whole Chain, which is compo&s;ed of many &s;uch Links, is in Fact broken too. There can be no civil or public Union, where there is no private, familiar, or matrimonial Union. All other Laws <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">QUID LEGES SINE MORIBUS? HOR.</NOTE> are u&s;ele&s;s, and ineffectual. But MATRIMONY is not an external or artificial FORM, but a NA|TURAL or &s;ub&s;tantial FORM. NATURE it&s;elf, or the LAW of GOD, bounds, or determines it. Where there is a MOTHER, there is always MATRIMONY; unle&s;s by human Artifice the na|tural Connexion be broken: and if we take the pains to range together in Order, the Ideas and Sentiments, which ari&s;e on this Subject, the true E&s;&s;ence, or Definition of MATRIMONY may be thus expre&s;&s;ed:
<Q>&startq;It is the Union, or Communion of ONE MAN with ONE WOMAN, ari&s;ing from natural Affection, certified and e&s;tabli&s;hed by free Con&s;ent, confirmed by Tye, &endq;and &s;anctified by mutual Fidelity, for &s;ocial Happine&s;s.</Q>
The Prie&s;t therefore, who excommunicates, or damns a Per&s;on, who fulfills this Duty, without his LEAVE, denounces Damnation again&s;t a Virtue, the &s;imple&s;t, the pure&s;t, and mo&s;t perfect, in|tirely conformable to the Law of GOD, and to the Order and Welfare of civil Society. The Pre&s;umption, &s;o &s;trongly mark'd, according to his Manner, by the tragic Poet, in the Ca&s;e of poor OPHELIA, is here much aggravated:
<Q><L>&mdash;Lay her i' th' Earth;</L>
<L>And from her pure and unpolluted Fle&s;h</L>
<L>May Vi'lets &s;pring! I tell thee, churli&s;h Prie&s;t,</L>
<L>A min'&s;tring ANGEL &s;hall my SISTER be,</L>
<L>When thou lie&s;t howling.
<BIBL>SHAKESPEAR.</BIBL></L></Q>
On the other hand the FORM or ESSENCE of FORNICATION is this:
<Q>&startq;It is the promi&s;cuous Commixture of many Men with one Woman, without natural Affection, without Fidelity, &endq;and without regard to the Care of Children, or of &s;ocial Hap|pine&s;s.</Q>
Fornication therefore can rarely be committed by one Man and one Woman only; &s;ince it &s;uppo&s;es Pro&s;titution either merely brutal, or, as the Word denotes,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is derived from the Greek Word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> the Force of which will be under&s;tood from the following Ob&s;ervations.</NOTE> gainful; It dif|fers from a Rape, becau&s;e the one &s;uppo&s;es Con&s;ent, the other Force. It differs al&s;o from Adultery, becau&s;e the one &s;uppo&s;es a Breach of conjugal Fidelity, the other not; it neither ari&s;es from pure Affection, nor produces it; and therefore is neither con|formable to NATURE, nor to &s;ocial or civil Happine&s;s. Mere Lu&s;t is brutal; and in a Creature &s;o con&s;tituted as MAN, while in a natural State he remained untaught, and uncorrupted, never did, and never could operate, without a Mixture of other Af|fections, which purify and refine it. Since then the Nature of Man, and of civil Society in particular, &s;eem to direct and to re|quire a Purity and Integrity of Manners, in Oppo&s;ition to In|continence, and Pro&s;titution, how comes it to pa&s;s that &s;o general a Corruption &s;hould prevail, which in fact cuts off many of the natural Sources of human Happine&s;s both private and public?</P>
<P>The An&s;wer to this Que&s;tion is not, perhaps, very obvious, It mu&s;t be owned however that the Corruption, here noted, is confined to the <HI>European</HI> Provinces, where indeed it &s;eems ge|neral; unle&s;s it be extended al&s;o to tho&s;e Regions, which have received the Infection from the Influence of <HI>European</HI> Manners; which NOW indeed is almo&s;t every where. The other Parts of the Globe remain free from this Corruption.</P>
<P>The <HI>European</HI> Climates have in all Ages bred a Race of Men more hardy and bold, more inqui&s;itive and adventrous, and of a Genius more various and ver&s;atile, than the other Parts of the Globe. As their natural Di&s;po&s;ition wou'd render them more &s;en&s;ible of Wants, &s;o al&s;o more capable of contriving Ways to gratify them. Moreover a certain Inequality is ob&s;erved in the Number of Births, in which the Males exceed the Females. This Inequality, if original and con&s;tant, as &s;eems probable, affords a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to the Que&s;tion. The &s;ame Genius, and together with it, the &s;ame Inequality, extended along the Coa&s;ts of <HI>A&s;ia Minor</HI>, and &s;o perhaps to <HI>Aegypt</HI>; while Ea&s;t|ward thro' all the Regions of <HI>A&s;ia</HI>, a contrary inequality &s;eems to have prevailed: where a greater Number of Females gave Ri&s;e to the Cu&s;tom of Polygamy, which always did, and doth yet to this Day prevail in the Ea&s;tern Countries. This reci|procal Inequality gave ri&s;e al&s;o to a mo&s;t remarkable Difference between the <HI>Europeans</HI>, and Ea&s;tern <HI>A&s;iatic</HI> Sages, Philo&s;ophers, or Legi&s;lators, in their Moral, Religious, or Mythological In|&s;titutions, De&s;criptions and Repre&s;entations. For in one Part the Females being too &s;oft, and di&s;&s;olute, and in the other the Males too fierce, and rough, hence it happened that, There, the Origin of the EVIL was derived from WOMAN, while Here, every GRACE and every VIRTUE was repre&s;ented in a Female Form, and receiv'd a feminine Appellation. This Ob&s;ervation might be extended much farther; but this may &s;eem &s;ufficient to make us remember that Manners and Cu&s;toms have often a deep Foundation in Nature, and that it belongs to Philo|&s;ophers and Legi&s;lators to ob&s;erve that Foundation, when they attempt to de&s;cribe or regulate the Order, the Connexions, and the Con&s;equences of human Actions.</P>
<P>Let us now return to the Que&s;tion. The Exce&s;s of Males, co-operating with their bold and adventrous Spirit, at fir&s;t wou'd produce Rapes, but never Fornication, till the cu&s;tomary Nece&s;&s;i|tudes of Neighbourhood, and mutual Intercour&s;e of Friend&s;hips rendering odious by Degrees &s;uch Violation of natural Right and Freedom of Con&s;ent, as the frequent Quarrels and Slaughter of tho&s;e who defended, and of tho&s;e who reveng'd that Violation, wou'd render it dangerous; they were taught at la&s;t, or rather compell'd by nece&s;&s;ity to relieve their Wants among Strangers. Thus Traffick begun, and Commerce with Foreigners; and the fir&s;t Traffick was made with female Slaves, who were either bought, or &s;tolen, or forc'd away from their native Country, expo&s;ed to &s;ale in a &s;trange Land, where they again pro&s;tituted them&s;elves for hire, to &s;upply the Want of Females. From this &s;ervile Condition, and mercenary Pro&s;titution, the Name of Fornication is derived. And indeed every degree of Subjection, which excludes Freedom of choice, corrupts the Sanctity, and &s;o de&s;troys the E&s;&s;ence of Matrimony, and turns it into For|nication. Matrimony, as was &s;aid before, receives its Sanction from the united Powers of natural Affection or free Choice, of U&s;e, and of Fidelity. Where the fir&s;t is wanting, the la&s;t, perhaps, is rarely found; and where the la&s;t is wanting, the Wife, however authoris'd, becomes a legal Strumpet.</P>
<P>Such then, was the Source of Fornication, derived, as it &s;eems, from the Inequality of the Sexes. And in general it may be ob&s;erved, that where the Number of the Males exceeds the Females, there Fornication is cu&s;tomary: where the contrary Order prevails, there Polygamy.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the &s;ame Cau&s;es, which in the Order of Nature, and by divine Providence, produced this partial Evil, have produced al&s;o a much greater and more general Good; for they extended Commerce, and mutual Exchange of Conveniences between the mo&s;t di&s;tant Regions; and together with that, it is our own Fault, if, in the &s;ame gradual Progre&s;&s;ion, Knowledge and Virtue, and univer&s;al Benevolence be not equally extended; &s;o that the whole Globe may become ONE Empire, and human Kind the Subjects and Citizens under the Dominion of ONE King, the SUPREME LORD and Governor of the UNIVERSE. But the fame Error, or Craft of political Super&s;tition, and arti|ficial Religon, which hath augmented this partial Evil into a general Corruption, have hitherto retarded the Progre&s;&s;ion of Knowledge and Virtue; while the former hath been chiefly ap|plied in contriving Means to promote Luxury, and by converting the latter into a meer Name, hath &s;ub&s;tituted in its &s;tead I know not what mon&s;trous, and unnatural Form, or preten&s;e of Reli|gion, which hath turned Vice into a Trade, and &s;anctified Wars and Trea&s;ons, Tyranny, and Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>Thus the Corruption, which at fir&s;t may &s;eem to have been nece&s;&s;ary, by degrees became voluntary, and at length nece&s;|&s;ary again, when it receiv'd Authority and Sanction from religious In&s;titutions. For in the earlie&s;t Times as the Wor&s;hip of dead Men deified prevaled, the Rites, and Ceremonies, and religious Fe&s;tivals in&s;tituted to their Honour, con&s;ecrated Lewdne&s;s, and made it meritorious. And when the Merchant-Adventurers of this precious Commodity had brought from beyond Sea a beau|tiful VIRGIN to the I&s;land CYTHERA, &s;he there received the Name of that I&s;land; and becau&s;e the People knew not her Birth, or Country, they were taught to believe that &s;he aro&s;e in a miraculous Manner from the FOAM of the Sea, &s;o &s;he be|came a Godde&s;s, and was the vulgar or popular VENUS, the Patrone&s;s of Lewdne&s;s and Fornication. The Poets and Painters indeed, and after them the Virtuo&s;i or Philo&s;ophers cha&s;ti&s;ed and refined this Notion, till at la&s;t they converted it into a mythical, or allegorical Per&s;on, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to com|municate to the Products of NATURE and to the Works of ART, their proper GRACE and BEAUTY. This Species of Vice however, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Refinements, became gene|ral and exten&s;ive, and was the nece&s;&s;ary Effect, and Con&s;equence of that political Super&s;tition, which introduced the Wor&s;hip of deified Mortals, and will always prevail, in proportion as the &s;ame Super&s;tition prevails; which being founded in Ignorance, and implicit FAITH, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily check the Growth of Rea&s;on and Free-Thought, and cheri&s;h and indulge the gro&s;&s;er Pa&s;&s;ions. MOSES, the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Lawgiver, and the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Pro|phets, who alone &s;eem to have under&s;tood, and follow'd his Sy&s;tem, (for the Prie&s;ts either did not under&s;tand, or corrupted it) have &s;trongly mark'd this Connexion between MAN-Wor|&s;hip and Vice, and particularly with a ju&s;t Severity have cha|racteri&s;ed that Lewdne&s;s, which is the Effect of it; in&s;omuch that they denote by the &s;ame Term of Fornication or Whore|dom, both the Wor&s;hip it&s;elf; and the Debauchery, which attended it. The Chri&s;tians, contrary to the De&s;ign of their Founder, have run into the &s;ame Corruption, by wor&s;hipping HIM as GOD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&rindx;</NOTE> who always called him&s;elf a MAN; of which Truth indeed there needs no other Proof, than his Birth and Death. He rejected both the Prie&s;tly and Kingly Office: <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">: tho' he had, it &s;eems, the indelible Character. This Ob&s;tinacy, or Con&s;tancy, drew upon him the Effects of a mo&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent Hatred, and produced a Super&s;tition equally incon&s;i&s;tent. He was puni&s;hed as a SLAVE, and wor&s;hip'd as a GOD. He was deified after his Death; which however was not intended before: For all that the Genius of <HI>Judai&s;m</HI> al|low'd, was, that having SEEN GOD, like MOSES, he became authori&s;ed, like <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to be in PLACE of GOD. But this Principle being now extended, it happened, that whereas that Privilege belonged to the latter during Life only, it belonged to the former for ever. This great Change effectually deter|mined the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation, and at the &s;ame time as effectu|ally accommodated it to the Genius of Heatheni&s;m. The Heathens in Fact pre&s;ently under&s;tood this Deification, and as readily admitted it. Accordingly they repre&s;ented the Chri&s;tians, in their MYSTERIES, as exerci&s;ing the &s;ame abominable Lewdne&s;s which had been exerci&s;ed in their OWN: For at this Time, partly by the Cen&s;ure and Ridicule of the Free-Thinking Philo&s;ophers tho&s;e Scenes of Lewdne&s;s, exhibited in the Heathen MYSTE|RIES, had been re&s;trained, and the MYSTERIES them&s;elves, in con&s;equence of this Refinement of Ta&s;te, and gradual Progre&s;&s;ion of Rea&s;on, and natural Politene&s;s, &s;ome of them had been re|formed, and others aboli&s;hed, by the Authority of the Civil Ma|gi&s;trate. The&s;e My&s;teries were acted in the Night; and the frequent Lewdne&s;s practi&s;ed in the&s;e religious Ma&s;querades gave occa&s;ion to the old Comic Poets to lay the Scene of their Plays, and form their Plots; which, as they imitated or repre&s;ented by Action in a public Manner, and &s;o render'd odious, or ridiculous, what was there acted privately, and under Pretence of Religion, &s;eem to have fallen under the Penalties of Law, which made it Capital to revile what was tran&s;acted in tho&s;e &s;olemn A&s;&s;emblies. Hence it happened, that being forbid to expo&s;e the&s;e Corruptions, they became more harmle&s;s and innocent (as we &s;ay) in their Draughts. This Re&s;traint of the ancient Comedy is ob&s;erved by HORACE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>&mdash;Choru&s;que</L>
<L>Turpiter oblicuit, &s;ublato jure NOLENDI, ad PISONES.</L></NOTE>; and before him CICERO <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Quid mihi di&s;placeat, INNOCENTES Poetae indicant Comici. <BIBL>CIC. DE LEG. II.</BIBL></NOTE> had declared his Abhorrence of the&s;e MYSTERIES, &s;ince the Poets were com|pelled to &s;pare Vice now it was thus cheri&s;hed and protected by Religion. Tho&s;e faint and languid De&s;criptions, or rather Hints, of Vice, were very di&s;agreeable to the free Genius of this won|derful MAN, who was a mo&s;t &s;incere and ardent Lover of VIR|TUE, as derived from Liberty and the Exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on, and Free Thought. He expo&s;ed with a ju&s;t abhorrence, and free Indignation, Vice of every kind, as appears in his character|i&s;tic Draughts of the Manners of CATALINE, of CLODIUS, and of M. ANTHONY; for he lived in an Age when the <HI>Roman</HI> Nobility were degenerated from the Virtues of their Forefathers. This rendered him odious; and he fell at la&s;t a Sacrifice as much to the Cau&s;e of TRUTH and VIRTUE, as of LIBERTY and his Country. Nothing enrages Men of profligate Manners &s;o much as free Cen&s;ure of their Vices. They cannot bear Ridicule. Their Pa&s;&s;ions, their Opinions, their Manners, and their Actions, are all contrary to Truth and Nature. They hate tho&s;e who di&s;cover that Contrariety; and wou'd hate them&s;elves too, if Super&s;tition did not &s;upply means of Commu+tation, and, which is yet a greater Comfort, of Recrimination. This double Comfort the Heathens found in their Super&s;tition, and as Super&s;tition &s;upplied the Means, &s;o the&s;e &s;upported them in their Super&s;tition again&s;t the Freedom and Ridicule of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians. They did not di&s;like their Rites, their Cere|monies, or their My&s;teries; for many of them imitated their own. The&s;e then, when &s;imilar, they cou'd ea&s;ily recogni&s;e; and when new, or di&s;&s;imilar, as ea&s;ily adopt, but they hated them for the Purity of their Manners, and the preci&s;e Re&s;erved|ne&s;s, and un&s;ociable Singularity of their Behaviour: Nor was this Purity of Manners in the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians derived from tho&s;e Rites, or Ceremonies, or My&s;teries; but from that &s;trong Renitence, or Re&s;entment, which always &s;ucceeds, when the Force of bad Habit, or Cu&s;tom, beginning to abate, Vice be|comes odious, and natural Affection returns. For the great Difference between meer Cu&s;tom, or vicious Cu&s;tom and NA|TURE, is apparent, and operates &s;trongly in all religious Revo|lutions. The former decays, and abates; the latter is &s;trength|ened, and confirmed by TIME. This Abatement of vicious Cu&s;tom, at the Time here hinted, was derived from the gradual Progre&s;&s;ion of REASON, and Free-Thinking, which ri&s;ing fir&s;t from the inqui&s;itive Genius of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Philo&s;ophers, was ex|tended by Degrees to all Parts of the World, along the &s;everal Lines of Communication, which all centred in ROME. By this means People every where &s;aw the Folly and Ab&s;urdities of their &s;everal ancient and e&s;tabli&s;hed Super&s;titions; and when they &s;aw the Ab&s;urdity, they &s;oon grew tir'd of the cu&s;tomary Vices, which were connected with it. And hence they went with eagerne&s;s into a NEW Religion, which merely on Account of Novelty and Singularity, had yet gained no Connexion with Vice. But this Purity of Manners, or Virtue of the fir&s;t Chri&s;|tians &s;eemed rather to be a foreign Branch, adopted, or ingrafted, than a natural Shoot. For tho' Virtue was indeed inculcated, and commanded by the fir&s;t Me&s;&s;engers, or Mi&s;&s;onaries of the Go&s;pel, yet it was <HI>never taught</HI>. The People were never made to &s;ee, and recogni&s;e tho&s;e Principles, by which it is connected with NATURE. It was only an accidental Effect of Novelty co-operating with IMPLICIT FAITH. So the graft never took. There was indeed Contiguity; but not Connexion. The Prin|ciple of Life, and growth was wanting. When therefore the Force of Novelty abated, the cu&s;tomary Virtue abated too, tho' IMPLICIT FAITH continually increa&s;ed and augmented; and the Chri&s;tians gradually reverted into all that Corruption and Lewdne&s;s, which they had before ridiculed and abhorr'd; of which among the Gentiles we have here attempted to &s;hew the Source and Progre&s;s.</P>
<P>But as the Chri&s;tians gradually reverted into tho&s;e Corrupti|ons, the Exce&s;s of which by exciting Aver&s;ion, Indignation and Abhorrence, prepar'd the Way for the Propagation of the Go&s;|pel; &s;o we find a particular In&s;tance ev'n of a greater <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 CORINTH. v.</NOTE>Degree of Vice, which had prevailed among them, than had been common|ly known among the Gentiles. It may &s;eem &s;trange, perhaps, that either of the&s;e &s;hou'd happen at any Time among a People who believe, or who pretend to believe, the Doctrine of the <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI>, and who accordingly live under the Hope and Fear of eternal Reward and Puni&s;hment; and &s;tranger yet, that the latter &s;hou'd happen, when the Force of Novelty was added, under the immediate Direction of an In&s;pired Mi&s;&s;ionary, and ev'n under the irre&s;i&s;tible Conviction of Apo&s;tolical Miracles. But perhaps the guilty Per&s;on was only a nominal Chri&s;tian, and a&s;&s;ociated with the true Believers with a malicious De&s;ign to di&s;grace and betray them. Or if he was indeed a Chri&s;tian, the Crime might be derived from an erroneous Imitation of St. PAUL him&s;elf, who tho' he both di&s;&s;uaded others, and him&s;elf ab&s;tained from the cu&s;tomary, or legal Forms of Marriage, yet had
<Q>&startq;a &endq;SISTER, a WIFE,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 CORINT. ix.5.</NOTE> as well as the other Apo&s;tles.</Q>
By the Word SISTER he &s;eems to mean a Believer; <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>id.</HI> vi.6.vii.15, &amp; pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE> which meaning I chu&s;e rather than that which includes a natural Relation, and &s;o wou'd infer Ince&s;t; and tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, it is not impo&s;&s;ible that even the latter might be the Ca&s;e in fact, when we con&s;ider, that the De&s;ign of the Chri&s;tian was only to ful|fill the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation, by re&s;toring Mankind to their na|tural Freedom; and that PAUL, being a JEW, as well as all who believe the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Account of the Creation, cou'd not in|deed e&s;teem the Matrimonial Union of Brother and Si&s;ter to be ince&s;tuous, nor ever judge that to be &s;inful, which at the Begin|ning was nece&s;&s;ary. It mu&s;t be own'd, however, that this Nece&s;&s;ity, tho' (as I believe) it hath never been objected, yet is indeed the &s;tronge&s;t Objection that can be made to the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Co&s;mogony, as it infers a manife&s;t Incon&s;i&s;tency between That and the &s;ub&s;equent In&s;titution, in which &s;uch Union is declared to be ince&s;tuous. And thus much concerning the Ri&s;e, the Pro|gre&s;s and E&s;&s;ence of Fornication.</P>
<P>Now concerning the Remedies, which have been apply'd to this Corruption, it is plain they have all prov'd ineffectual. The Remedy exhibited, at the Beginning of the Chri&s;tian In&s;titution, did not in fact an&s;wer the Intention of Cure; and &s;ince that Time the Cure it&s;elf &s;eems not to have been intended. In the fir&s;t Ca&s;e the Remedy did not corre&s;pond with the Intention, becau&s;e it did not corre&s;pond with NATURE. It was found|ed only in po&s;itive Command and Implicit Faith. But IMPLICIT FAITH, tho' it hath, as we &s;ee in the Effects of Bigotry and Per&s;ecution, great Force, when it co-operates with the Pa&s;&s;ions, in rendering them more Malignant, yet hath in fact very little, or no Moment in &s;ome Ca&s;es, when it acts, or is intended to act in a contrary Direction; and in other Ca&s;es when the Pa&s;&s;ions are exce&s;&s;ive, or vehement, it ev'n co-operates with them, as before, and augments their Moment. And the Rea&s;on is plain; for when it intentionally co-operates with Pa&s;&s;ion, the Imagination, which is already corrupted, immediately &s;ugge&s;ts, without Conviction, the Opinion of Obedience to the Will of GOD; which Opinion by &s;anctifying the Pa&s;&s;ion, renders it more Malignant. And thus it always actuates Bigots, in whom it foments a greater Degree of furious and outrageous Malevo|lence, than cou'd po&s;&s;ibly be excited by a &s;imple and compounded Pa&s;&s;ion, even in the fierce&s;t Barbarian. But when Implicit Faith acts, or at lea&s;t is intended to act, in a Direction contrary to Pa&s;&s;ion, being, as it always is, without Conviction, it produces no con&s;tant Sentiment, or Feeling, but only by a temporary and &s;udden Oppo&s;ition of other Pa&s;&s;ions, either of HOPE or FEAR, the Mind or WILL, takes a certain BENT, or turn, in which the vicious Pa&s;&s;ion &s;eems to receive a momentary Check, by the Force of implicit Faith, which &s;eems al&s;o to act in a con|trary Direction. But it only &s;eems; for the Mind or Will, being thus forc'd without conviction, by a quick Return, pre|&s;ently exerts the morbid Pa&s;&s;ion, like an Arrow from a Bow, with greater Force and Violence.</P>
<P>If this Phaenomenon be here truly reported as experimental and verified in Fact, the following Ob&s;ervations will de&s;erve to be con&s;ider'd, and e&s;tabli&s;hed as fundamental Truths in Morality.</P>
<P N="1">1. That all Super&s;tition founded in implicit Faith is directly oppo&s;ite and contrary to Virtue; as it nece&s;&s;arily tends to foment and &s;trengthen the vicious and unnatural Pa&s;&s;ions, and to render them more malignant. And hence it happens that in all In|&s;titutions, Moral, Civil, or Religious, Vice is augmented by the very Means which are intended to cure it.</P>
<P N="2">2. That even the MORAL SENSE, and the NATURAL AF|FECTIONS derived from it, tho' when con&s;idered as a Sy&s;tem or Con&s;titution of human Nature, they are manife&s;tly intended by the Supreme Creator and Governor, to point the Way, and direct to Virtue and Happine&s;s, yet &s;ingly, or without a Re|gulator, are in&s;ufficient to pre&s;erve a due Balance nece&s;&s;ary to that Purpo&s;e, and to give them Con&s;tancy, Stability and Security. For cu&s;tomary Virtue, or Obligation derived from the Moral Sen&s;e only, is indeed IMPLICIT FAITH; but It is IMPLICIT FAITH founded in NATURE; not as Super&s;tition, in Chimera. The former therefore tends to the Perfection of Nature; the latter to the Corruption. But as the Implicit Faith, or cu&s;tomary Error of Super&s;tition, renders the unnatural Pa&s;&s;ions more malig|nant, &s;o the Implicit Faith, or cu&s;tomary Enthu&s;ia&s;m of the Moral Sen&s;e, &s;ometimes renders the natural Affections exce&s;&s;ive. I &s;ay <HI>&s;ometimes</HI>, but not <HI>always</HI>, nor often. Perhaps it would <HI>never</HI> produce that Effect, if the cro&s;s Operations of Super&s;tition were totally removed. It wants therefore a Regulator, to balance the Movement ev'n in a natural State; and much more when it &s;inks under the unnatural Pre&s;&s;ure of Super&s;tition. This Regulator is REASON or FREE THOUGHT; which di&s;covering in the Con&s;titution of Things the means and the End, recog|ni&s;es the LAW of NATURE, or WILL of GOD, and &s;hews the Connexion between Truth, Virtue and Happine&s;s, while Con&s;cience ari&s;ing from that Review and Recognition, becomes a voluntary Obligation, and MAN a free Subject of the LORD of NATURE.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence it happens al&s;o, that the BIGOT, or &s;uper&s;titious Re|ligioni&s;t, who&s;e Religion is founded only in IMPLICIT FAITH, views and repre&s;ents human Nature as corrupt, though the Cor|ruption indeed either is not in NATURE, but in the Medium, through which it is view'd; or el&s;e is fir&s;t introduced by Super|&s;tition, and then augmented by that which is pretended to be a Cure.</P>
<P N="4">4 Hence al&s;o may be di&s;covered the Cau&s;e and E&s;&s;ence of that, which in S. S. is noted as a Secret under the Name of the
<Q>&startq;MY|&endq;STERY of INIQUITY.</Q>
This Secret, or My&s;tery, is in Fact nothing more than the nece&s;&s;ary Effect of Super&s;tion, in corrupt|ing Mankind, as here de&s;cribed, and of the Application of wrong Means in curing, which indeed increa&s;e and augment it.</P>
<P>MANDEVILLE, the Author of "the Fable of the Bees," in various In&s;tances, characterizes truly, and ridicules this Corrup|tion, which yet, by an habitual Mi&s;take of implicit Faith, ari&s;ing from the Corruption it&s;elf, he repre&s;ents as natural. He felt the Force of this Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in him&s;elf, and &s;aw it in others; but &s;aw not the Cau&s;e. He acknowledged it too: and this at lea&s;t was $ngenuous. Divines, however, with their u&s;ual undi&s;tingui&s;hing Imputation, treat him as a Mon&s;ter of Impiety; becau&s;e it &s;eems he has drawn a "FORM of GODLINESS without the SPIRIT." a Spectre of Religion without VIRTUE, and without Sub|&s;tance. This is the Imputation. Perhaps it is true; but it is certainly true, that he did not make, but di&s;cover it. It is not His, but their OWN: and this is His Impiety.
<Q><L>"&mdash;Ye holy Men</L>

The Poet,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Tragedy of GUSTAVUS VASA.</NOTE> we &s;ee, gives the Work to the proper Artificer. This was ju&s;t; but though the Mu&s;e is &s;agacious as well as ju&s;t; it would require all her Sagacity to unfold the Secrets of this Art.
<Q><L>In Nova fert Animas, mutatas dicere formas</L>
<L>Corpora&mdash;</L></Q>
The various Sy&s;tems of Super&s;tition, or artificial Religion, which have been employed to dre&s;s and adorn Nature, have at the &s;ame Time covered its Deformity, and concealed its Beauty. This &s;acred Garment hath been turned and cut in a thou&s;and fan|ta&s;tic Fa&s;hions, till now at la&s;t, Time and U&s;e have worn it &s;o thread-bare, that all but the Wearer &s;ee the Stuff and the Workman&s;hip. 'Tis a Sort of regimental Coat made to fit all Shapes, and Sizes. Virtue, under this Di&s;gui&s;e, becomes a Name only; a mere Pretence; the Effect of Pride, drawn out into a coar&s;er, or finer Thread of Simulation. We all &s;ee this Truth; all complain of the general Corruption; yet &s;till with one &s;ingle Exception. MANDEVILLE attacks this Exception, and turns it into a Proof. We are plea&s;ed to find in his Pictures a Truth, and a Likene&s;s, but angry to &s;ee our own Likene&s;s: and he re&s;embles the Painter who plea&s;ed every Body and Nobody. It is al&s;o objected to him that his Figures, though truly de&s;igned, are yet for the mo&s;t Part drawn from low Life, and &s;o unworthy of De&s;cription: but we ought al&s;o to con&s;ider, that, in order to acquire a real Knowledge, NATURE mu&s;t be viewed in all her Works. Not only the vegetable, the animal, the rational Creatures di&s;play the Wi&s;dom of their Creator, but even Stocks and Stones. And in the moral Science, which is indeed the proper Knowledge and Bu&s;ine&s;s of Man; not only the Learned, the Noble, and the Wi&s;e, but the Ignorant, the Ba&s;e, and the Fooli&s;h, are al&s;o proper Objects of Con&s;ideration; &s;ince even "of the&s;e STONES GOD is able to rai&s;e up CHILDREN unto ABRAHAM."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. MATT. iii.</NOTE></P>
<P>If &s;uch as above de&s;cribed, be the nece&s;&s;ary Effect of Su|per&s;tition, in propagating Vice and Corruption, all wi&s;e and good Men will &s;ufficiently feel the Force of Duty and Obligation to unite their Endeavours, and exert their Power of oppo&s;ing it. For
<Q>&startq;if TIME (as Lord BACON &s;ays) alter Things to the wor&s;e; and Wi&s;dom and Coun&s;el &s;hall not alter them to the better, what &s;hall be the End? We &s;ee the Reign or Tyranny of CUSTOM, what it is. Super&s;tition is now &s;o well advanced, that Men &endq;of the fir&s;t Blood are as firm as Butchers by Occupations.</Q>
And are not Men to be found of the whole Blood (to appropriate his Lord&s;hip's Expre&s;&s;ion) as &s;taunch and &s;ure in Truth and Vir|tue, as the Hell-hounds of Super&s;tition in Vice and Fal&s;hood? There is now an apparent Contra&s;t, or Oppo&s;ition of Character between tho&s;e who, following Cu&s;tom, are continually altering Things to the wor&s;e, and tho&s;e, who keeping their Minds open to Conviction, are prepared to receive continual Amendment: In a Word, between the &s;uper&s;titious BIGOTS, and rational FREE-THINKERS. The Former indeed accu&s;e the latter as Innovators:
<Q><L>"As if Religion was intended</L>
<L>"For nothing el&s;e but to be mended.</L></Q></P>
<P>They accu&s;e them too of Impiety and ATHEISM. This Accu|&s;ation doth not de&s;erve an An&s;wer; as it is notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e. And as to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Innovation; the Accu&s;ation perhaps were true,
<Q>&startq;if TIME &s;tood &s;till; which contrariwi&s;e moveth &s;o round, that a froward Retention of Cu&s;tom is as turbulent a Thing as Innovation. TIME it&s;elf is the greate&s;t Innova|&endq;tor;</Q>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">BACON.</NOTE> yet &s;o, that by &s;uch Innovation, the Wi&s;e and Virtuous are &s;till rendered greater Slaves to the Fooli&s;h and Vicious. Add now to Time Experience, to Experience Wi&s;dom, to Wi&s;dom Benevolence and good Intention, the Conjunction, will produce a Reformation, which, by approaching &s;till nearer to TRUTH, cannot fail, in &s;ome degree, of producing a good Effect in re|deeming Mankind from the Bondage of Vice and Super&s;tition, and in re&s;toring to REASON it's natural Freedom, and ju&s;t Au|thority. Mankind is capable of Improvement in an endle&s;s Pro|gre&s;&s;ion. This is plain from the pre&s;ent Order and Con&s;titution of Things. They who neglect this Improvement in the pre&s;ent, and refer it wholly to a future State, blend together and confound certain with uncertain, known with unknown. They imitate the ignorant Ru&s;tic, who &s;tood waiting on the Bank till the Stream &s;hould all be pa&s;s'd.
<Q><L>Ru&s;ticus expectat dum defluat Amnis; at ille</L>
<L>Labitur, &amp; labetur in omne volubilis Aevum.</L></Q>
By this Di&s;cipline they &s;well the Mind with an unnatural Pride, the Parent of fal&s;e Virtue, which is indeed the wor&s;t Sort of Vice, and fill it with vain Hope and fond Expectation of future Perfection imaginary and unknown, while they neglect pre&s;ent Improvement, which is real and known. If &s;ome in&s;pired Nur&s;e &s;hould teach the next Generation to keep their Children &s;wathed and bound till they were full grown, under Pretence that by the early U&s;e of Legs and Arms men were a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the habitual Perpetration of Mi&s;chief, and that by &s;topping their Growth much Evil would be prevented, for which, in a future State they &s;hould be rewarded with Wings; moreover if the Clergy finding this Fondne&s;s tended to promote the Honour and Profit of their Office, &s;hould defend and propagate the Practice with all their Arts of Learning and Eloquence, and expatiating largely on the glorious Perfection of High-flying, &s;hould de&s;cend par|ticularly to explain and illu&s;trate the wonderful Strength, Pro|portion and Activity of tho&s;e Nerves and Mu&s;cles, which are adapted to perform all the various Motions of flying: doubtle&s;s we &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee (at lea&s;t in the Imagination of every Believer) Wings pullulating as fa&s;t as tho&s;e of a Butterfly. It would be a plea&s;ant Amu&s;ement for the Painter or Poet, to repre&s;ent or de&s;cribe the &s;everal Sorts of the&s;e atheriel Wing&s;ters. A bulky Doctor, who&s;e Weight and Power of Gravitation was great, would be &s;een to ri&s;e, or &s;carce perhaps to ri&s;e with Difficulty:
<Q><L>"As when a Dab-chick waddles through the Cop&s;e,</L>
<L>"On Feet and Wings, and flies, and wades, and hops.</L>

<L>"He tries, but tries in vain, th' aerial Race,</L>
<L>"And &s;eems to emulate a Gander's Face.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Parody from POPE.</NOTE>"</L></Q>
The Flock of Curates, as being lighter, and le&s;s incumber'd with corporeal Weight, wou'd re&s;emble Jack-Daws and Squeal|ers, who are &s;een mo&s;t about Churches and Steeples. More|over, as every one during his State of Humanity or Probation, that is while his Wings were growing, and before his Conver|&s;ion, or Transformation, might be &s;uppos'd to write with a Pen made with a Quill of that particular Fowl, who&s;e Form he &s;hou'd hereafter a&s;&s;ume; hence the Harmle&s;s Compo&s;ers of Devotional Tracts, of Calls, Meditations, Preparations, and the like, would imitate that Species of Pidgeons, which from the Manner of their Flight are denominated Tumblers. One yonder, though glorying in the Spoils of the Peacock, and even dazzled with the Splendor of his Plumage, upon a nearer View may be di&s;covered to be a Jay. Another, who, having mi&s;&s;ed his Way to the upper Regions, may be &s;een wandering below in the Fields of <HI>Ely&s;ium</HI>, and hopping about with an Air of Impudence mixed with Malevolence, is heard to chatter hard Names, as Fool, Rogue, Infidel, Athei&s;t, and the like: This Fowl, I &s;ay, party coloured as he is, and variegated with black and white, commonly pa&s;&s;es for a Bird of Learning, and a great Critic. He is a &s;trong Proof of the old Proverb "that Two of a Trade "can never agree: For though he hates Mathematicians, yet he affects Demon&s;tration. From all the&s;e &s;pecifical Marks, or Characters of this Bird, one may ea&s;ily know it to be a Chick of that Breed, which the MUSES heretofore are &s;aid to have tran&s;|formed into MAGPIES. Proctors, Apparitors, and the re&s;t of the inferior Fry, who are retained as Spies and Informers, to cer|tain eccle&s;ia&s;tical Inqui&s;itors, may be changed into Crows, Ra|vens, and Vultures; which though by Nature intended to feed on Carrion, yet too often devour Lambs. Rich Rectors, plural Incumbents, Prebends, Canons, Deans, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who fea&s;ting on the Remnants of Loaves and Fi&s;hes, and on the Reliques of primitive Poverty, take a Pride in following the Rules and Ex|amples of Chri&s;tian Humility; all the&s;e a&s;&s;ume the Forms and imitate the Flight of Kites, Gleads, and Buzzards. They mount aloft in the Sky, and expatiating in large Circles, look down with Contempt on all tho&s;e Birds, which cannot &s;oar &s;o high as them&s;elves. They are however, much more harmle&s;s than the la&s;t mentioned; though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, they &s;ome|times &s;toop to &s;eize a Chicken. But the far greate&s;t Number, ac|cording to an old Ob&s;ervation, ri&s;e no higher than Bees, and never become Birds. The&s;e, it mu&s;t be owned, are a very u&s;e|ful little Creature, and &s;eem to be endowed with a mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite Sen&s;e, or Ta&s;t of Happine&s;s; &s;ince they &s;pend their Time and find their Food among the mo&s;t beautiful and fragrant Flow|ers, from which they extract, and prepare a certain liquid Sweet, that may be e&s;teemed both the Nectar and Ambro&s;ia of Immor|tality. One Circum&s;tance, however, mu&s;t needs impair their Fe|licity. According to Naturali&s;ts they are frequently infe&s;ted by a certain In&s;ect, like a Spider, which breeds in their Hives, and makes them &s;ick. This In&s;ect, it &s;eems, is known by the Name of CLERUS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PLIN. N. H. xv.19.</NOTE>. If the&s;e little Creatures could fore&s;ee this Incon|venience from the Beginning, certainly they would never de&s;ire Wings, but choo&s;e rather to remain for ever &s;wathed, and bound up, in the imperfect State of Maggots. The ancient <HI>Aegyptians</HI> under&s;tood the &s;wathing Practice; or rather perhaps were the fir&s;t Inventors of it; &s;ince they were the fir&s;t who &s;eem to have cul|tivated with Care, the Seeds of Super&s;tition. They begun the &s;wathing Di&s;cipline very early, and continued it after Death; for even their dead Bodies were &s;wathed with a mo&s;t religious Dili|gence. This could hardly be done to prevent their walking, as that indeed hath been rarely &s;een; and they were too wi&s;e to provide &s;o opero&s;e a Remedy to prevent a Fact which happened but &s;eldom. It was therefore intended to promote the Growth of Wings; which Cu&s;tom beginning in the earlie&s;t Age of In|fancy, then towards the middle, and &s;o to the latter End of Life, being interrupted, was now again renewed after Death, which completed the Operation. On the other Hand, they who are una&s;&s;i&s;ted with this &s;wathing Method, mu&s;t be contented for ever to want Wings; and what is wor&s;e, are not only hated, but even condemned to the wor&s;t of Puni&s;hments, becau&s;e they willfully reject, and &s;eem to de&s;pi&s;e an Advantage which can only be acquired by this &s;wathing Method. The&s;e therefore are Free-Thinkers. They pretend however that both the Reward and the Puni&s;hment are equally chimerical; that if they were real, yet the Method propo&s;ed can avail nothing, either to ob|tain the one, or to avoid the other. They affirm, that as it is uncertain whether the &s;wathing Method will hereafter produce Wings, &s;o at pre&s;ent it mu&s;t certainly contribute to make us lame. Man cannot be more wi&s;e, more happy, or more perfect than NATURE has intended: for NATURE is the WILL, or LAW of GOD. They choo&s;e therefore to walk on &s;ure Ground, rather than to indulge a &s;uper&s;titious Fondne&s;s, and vain longing after unattainable Perfection: and in&s;tead of artificial, or miraculous Wings, are contented with the natural and free, as well as more &s;ecure U&s;e of Legs and Feet. They acknowledge that this too is improveable. They &s;ee a Difference between the Gait of a Taylor and Dancing-Ma&s;ter; and between the Air of a Pea|&s;ant, and of a Gentleman. This Difference depends, in a great Degree, on Cu&s;tom and Di&s;cipline. The &s;ame, or even greater Difference is ob&s;ervable in the Mind and Manners. And &s;ince a certain illu&s;trious Prelate has a&s;&s;erted "that without HOPE "RELIGION is mere PHRENZY; and &s;ince this al&s;o &s;eems to be intended as a Characteri&s;tical De&s;cription of tho&s;e, who are promi&s;cuou&s;ly denominated Free-thinkers, Infidels and A|thei&s;ts, it may &s;eem proper perhaps, in this Place, to explain what the Hope of a FREE-THINKER is; leaving, in the mean Time, the Account of INFIDEL and ATHEIST to tho&s;e who claim the Title. The Hope of a Free-Thinker differs in gene|ral from the Hope of a Super&s;titious or artificial Religioni&s;t. This is uncertain and chimerical; whereas That, if not certain, is yet probable, being founded in NATURE, and in the Cour&s;e of Things. The Religioni&s;t hopes that Super&s;tition, the Free-thinker that Rea&s;on and Truth may prevail. He &s;ees, as before hinted, a gradual Progre&s;&s;ion of Knowledge and Manners, and that this Progre&s;&s;ion is improveable. And as he feels it to be his Happine&s;s, &s;o he really thinks it to be his Duty to a&s;&s;i&s;t this Improvement. And as in every preceding Revelation, or Re|formation of Religion, he &s;ees this gradual Progre&s;&s;ion &s;till ap|proaching nearer to Truth, and con&s;equently the Means of Know|ledge, and the Sen&s;e and Obligation of Virtue to be more and more extended; from this View he not only forms a plea&s;ing, but fixes a probable Expectation, that one time or other, according to the &s;tated Cour&s;e and Order of Things, Truth and Virtue will univer&s;ally prevail, and that all Mankind will become free Sub|jects of that ROYAL LAW,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. II.8.</NOTE> which is truly the LAW of NATURE, and the WILL of GOD. Thus he hopes, and not only hopes, but prays continually, according to the Direction of a Great FREE-THINKER: "THY KINGDOM COME." This is the Point which terminates his Hope. To this capital Point the whole Order of Things &s;eems to lead in a certain Progre&s;&s;ion, and by a clear and manife&s;t Connexion. Here then he re&s;ts. Not as the &s;uper&s;titious Bigot in a Circle of Tales, unconnected among them&s;elves, and contrary to Nature; nor as the artificial Bigot, who forms and reforms tho&s;e Tales, till they obtain, as he thinks, a Connexion among them&s;elves, and a Similarity, or Conformity with Nature; which vain Labour plainly &s;hews the Nece&s;&s;ity of referring Truth to a more certain Standard than mere Imagina|tion. This Standard is the LAW of NATURE, or WILL of GOD; which exacts a perfect Allegiance to the MAKER. This LAW includes Obligation, Sanction and Reward: all which are known, and felt, in Proportion as the Law it&s;elf is known, and felt, and recogni&s;ed. Every Part of it admits a clear and preci&s;e Definition, and is capable of being expre&s;&s;ed in intelligible Propo&s;itions, connected and con&s;i&s;tent, with Regard to the Motive, the Means, and the End; which cannot be truly affirmed of any Species of Super&s;tition, or artificial Religion. As to $uturity, the Freethinker leaves it among the SECRET "THINGS which belong unto GOD;" having, in this Ca&s;e, no &s;ufficient Foundation on which may be built any thing more certain than Conjecture, which may perhaps, afford Means of wi&s;hing, but none of proving. The&s;e Proofs, whenever they &s;hall be exhibited, mu&s;t ri&s;e on a Foundation more &s;trong, more &s;table, and more manife&s;t than tho&s;e which are derived from the mere Vi&s;ions of the &s;uper&s;titious Bigot, or the mere Sophi&s;ms of the artificial Religioni&s;t. Religion therefore is nothing el&s;e but a Sen&s;e, or Con&s;cience of Obligation ari&s;ing from the LAW, or WILL of GOD, expre&s;&s;ed, revealed, and commanded in the Con&s;titution of NATURE. By how much more freely and dili|gently we exerci&s;e and cultivate our REASON, by &s;o much more clearly this LAW is perceived and under&s;tood. From this Re|cognition, formed and confirmed by the united Powers of Cu&s;tom, Experience, and Rea&s;on, ari&s;es that perfect Sen&s;e or Con&s;cience of Duty and Obligation, which con&s;titutes real VIRTUE, or MANHOOD. Thus MAN is, or certainly is con&s;tituted and im|powered to be, capable of performing and fulfilling every Part of Duty to him&s;elf, to Mankind, and to his MAKER; being free from all tho&s;e mon&s;trous Growths of Vice, and Corruption, and from all that My&s;tery of INIQUITY, which having been intro|duced, fomented and e&s;tabli&s;hed by various artificial Sy&s;tems of Super&s;tition, hath almo&s;t totally corrupted human Nature; while under Pretence of Religion, all the unnatural Pa&s;&s;ions have been &s;uperinduced, and Man, in&s;tead of rational and pious, hath been rendered ab&s;urd and irrational in his Opinions, and in Prac|tice &s;elfi&s;h, unju&s;t, and impious. Hence it hath happened, that MEN INDEED are BRED NO WHERE;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BOLINGBROKE on Retirement, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 195.</NOTE> and that it is hard to find, any where,

<P>And &s;o much concerning the Cau&s;es of Corruption. We &s;hould next, according to the propo&s;ed Method, con&s;ider the Cure. But this in general may be gathered from precedent Ob|&s;ervations. The Application belongs to public Authority, and therefore I pre&s;ume not to meddle with it. But as to that parti|cular Species of Vice, of which the E&s;&s;ence, the Cau&s;e and Pro|gre&s;s have been explained, I may be allowed to ob&s;erve farther, that after the fir&s;t Efforts of Chri&s;tianity failed in correcting it, the Cure, &s;ince that Time doth not even &s;eem to have been intended; whether it be that the Attempt was thought to be vain and impracticable (as indeed it will always be found to be &s;o, when the Cure of Vice is attempted by Means of Super&s;tition, which &s;till encrea&s;es and foments it); or that the Managers of eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity thought it more advantageous to their Scheme, and more favourable to their Authority, to indulge Vice, and &s;ubdue the Pride of Virtue, by controlling, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, natu|ral Right, and ju&s;t Freedom: yet &s;o it is, that either Fornication is never puni&s;hed, or that which is vulgarly called &s;o, and pu|ni&s;hed as &s;uch, is not really Fornication. What it is we have &s;een before, where we have given a preci&s;e Definition of it. But when it &s;ometimes happens, that following the Impul&s;e of a na|tural Affection, &s;ome unexperienced young Man proceeds to in|dulge, and gratify it, with Sincerity and Simplicity, though with|out the Impudence of public Notice, or eccle&s;ia&s;tical Licence, this is not Fornication; there is no Pro&s;titution. It is the Effect of pure Affection; which is the true Foundation of that Love and Faith which con&s;titutes the &s;acred Union of the Sexes. Public No|tice can only violate the Mode&s;ty and Delicacy of this Affection, where it is &s;incere; and where it is brutal, &s;elfi&s;h, or in&s;incere, nei|ther that, nor Licence can give Sanctity to an impure Pa&s;&s;ion, or Security to one void of Faith. If Nature here may not be tru&s;ted, Art much le&s;s; if the former denies her Sanction, the latter can give none. It can give indeed, and this is all that it can give, &s;afe indulgence to the vicious and profligate, and Leave to play the Strumpet with more Security. As therefore it &s;eems unnece&s;&s;ary to ask leave to do that, which, when proceeding from a pure Mo|tive, is not only lawful, but a Duty, and when derived from an impure Motive, Nothing can &s;anctify; &s;o, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, it is ridiculous. And certainly this whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of artificial Matrimony, which now, through long Time and Cu&s;tom, is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and makes &s;o great a Part of civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity, had originally a very ridiculous, or perhaps a very im|pure or &s;elfi&s;h Motive. The Motive was &s;elfi&s;h, when the In|crea&s;e of Wealth, and the Di&s;tinction of Names and Fa|milies was &s;olely intended; the impure Motives may be better imagined,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. FONTENELLE, Dialogue VIII. CALLIRHEA. PAULINA.</NOTE> perhaps than de&s;cribed: and both, if repre|&s;ented truly, would be &s;een in a Light &s;ufficiently ridiculous. Yet Time and Cu&s;tom have turned the Per&s;pective, and by di&s;|gui&s;ing the Motives, the artificial UNION is become honourable, and the natural is rendered di&s;graceful. This with the comic Poet, is, "the WAY of the WORLD:" with the Philo&s;opher, "private Vices public Benefits:," and with the Divine, the MYSTERY of INIQUITY."&mdash;The only Way to cure this Evil, which is &s;till encrea&s;ing, is fir&s;t to turn the Per&s;pective; to re|pre&s;ent Things as they appeared at the Beginning, and to treat them accordingly. Let not MAN pre&s;ume to forbid, much le&s;s to condemn THAT, which GOD at fir&s;t commanded. Poli|tical Art wou'd be u&s;efully, and therefore properly employ'd, in finding Means to protect, to &s;upport and encourage this natural Liberty. The particular Ca&s;e marks and di&s;tingui&s;hes it&s;elf. Every Woman who bears a Child, can find a FATHER, who is a MAN; for there are NOW no GODFATHERS; and this FATHER is her HUSBAND. Perhaps the Choice was mutual, the Affection mutual; and if it was pure al&s;o, &s;ingle and indi|vidual, it mu&s;t needs produce that FAITH which completes the natural Union of the Sexes, and by fulfilling the divine Com|mand, and Order of NATURE, mu&s;t therefore be&s;t an&s;wer the End of civil Society. In the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of that Pa&s;&s;ion which connects the Sexes, and from thence produces the &s;tronge&s;t civil Connexions, there is &s;omething too nice and tender for com|mon Touch, and artificial handling. The very Admi&s;&s;ion of Witne&s;&s;es is a Sort of Pro&s;titution, or Fornication. It mu&s;t un|fold it&s;elf gradually, as one of tho&s;e Secrets of divine ART which admits not human Interpo&s;ition. It &s;eems to include a Sort of Sacramental My&s;tery; which needs not, and ev'n rejects the Force of public Re&s;traint, and of public Notice. But when that natural Union is violated by artificial Force, either both Parties are compelled into legal ADULTERY, if new Connexions are formed: or if not, which is indeed more u&s;ual, and &s;een in daily Experience, they are let loo&s;e to rove at random, through all the &s;en&s;ele&s;s Gro&s;sne&s;s of brutal Debauchery and Fornication. And this is the genuine and real Effect of that Method, which de|riving its Force from unnatural Affection, ab&s;urd Argument, and &s;uper&s;titious Motives, hath been vainly applied to cure an Evil, which by that Application hath continually increa&s;ed. And this is &s;o plain, that it may &s;eem probable the Cure was either not under&s;tood, or never intended.</P>
<P>It is evident therefore, that if the Evil be deemed real, &s;ome other Method of Cure &s;hou'd be intended. This can be no other than gradually to exhibit a right View of Nature, of Truth, and Virtue, and to &s;hew their Connexion with human Happine&s;s, both private and public. Next, as this particular Vice, accord|ing to its Origin, and progre&s;s, as before de&s;cribed, &s;eems more than any other, to be founded in the Con&s;titution of Mankind, and in the Inequality of the Sexes, it may &s;eem too to require and de&s;erve &s;ome Indulgence and Privilege, and &s;o become a proper Subject of Civil, or Political Licence. Be it therefore enacted, that no one pre&s;ume to keep without Licence either private or public Hou&s;e of Fornication, in which the Female Mode&s;ty is pro&s;tituted, and that no one without Licence vi&s;it or frequent &s;uch Hou&s;e of Fornication. Al&s;o that both the Keepers and Frequenters of &s;uch Hou&s;es be for ever excluded from all Public Offices, Civil or Military: Provided neverthele&s;s the &s;aid Keepers and Frequenters of &s;uch Hou&s;es be allowed or ad|mitted in all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Offices, any thing in this Act contain|ed to the Contrary notwith&s;tanding. And becau&s;e every CHILD, which may happen to be born in &s;uch Hou&s;es, may be con&s;ider'd as a Birth extraordinary or MIRACULOUS, &s;uch Child ought to be deem'd a <HI>Deodand</HI>, if a Male, and con&s;ecrated from his Birth: and if a Female; (&s;ince Super&s;tition is &s;till likely to proceed on its old Principles) hence al&s;o we &s;hou'd obtain a &s;acred Order of <HI>Palladian</HI> Virgins, who, according to the ancient, and original De&s;ign of their In&s;titution, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See STRABO Geograph.</NOTE> might become a Nur&s;ery or Seminary for the CHURCH. And &s;o much for the Cure of Fornication; which by this Method wou'd certainly be prevented, and where it could not be cured, the Evil wou'd be turned into Good.</P></NOTE>

Here indeed was a noble Field for Improvement; but falling under the Management of Bigots, this Scene of natural Beauty was pre&s;ently changed into a Scene of Deformity and Horror: While under Pretence of Converting the&s;e innocent People to the Practice and Di&s;cipline of a more pure and divine Religion, all the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Corruptions of Fraud and Vice were introduced; and all the Cruelties of Avarice, Rapine and Super&s;tition were &s;uperadded. The naked Inhabitants were hunted with Dogs; Wives and Daughters ravi&s;h'd before the Eyes of Hu&s;bands and Fathers;<NOTE PLACE="marg">&rindx;</NOTE> and Children murder'd, and torn to Pieces in the Sight of helple&s;s Parents. All this was done by Chri&s;tians to Savages and Babarians; by holy Prie&s;ts, who were Chri&s;|tians in Name only, to tho&s;e, who tho' call'd Savage and Bar|barous, were Chri&s;tians indeed: For they were mild, ju&s;t and benevolent! The &s;ame Fraud and Corruption, tho' not with equal Cruelty, have been introduced among the other <HI>Indian</HI> Nations by other <HI>European</HI> Strangers, who afterwards frequent|ed tho&s;e We&s;tern Regions; the hone&s;t Quakers only excepted, who &s;ettled in <HI>Pen&s;ylvania</HI>; the Effects of which are at this time particularly &s;een and felt by our Colonies in tho&s;e Parts. The Mi&s;&s;ionaries of Super&s;tition, it &s;eems, have taught the <HI>Indians</HI> to e&s;teem <HI>Britons</HI> as a Nation of Infidels and Athei&s;ts&punc; Towards the&s;e, Cruelty is meritorious; and that Inhumanity, which ev'n in a State of War is mon&s;trous, is now become ev'n among them, the Effect of Religion. The Practice indeed is horrible! and by de&s;troying every In&s;tinct of Morality and natural Affection, mu&s;t at length introduce the wor&s;t Tyranny of Super&s;tition in tho&s;e fruitful Countries. This, no doubt, is chiefly intended by tho&s;e Mi&s;&s;ionaries; it is their Trade. They are train'd and di&s;ciplin'd in Fraud and Cruelty. But in <HI>Britons</HI>, who are born and bred in a Land of Freedom; who are Friends and Guardians of Chri&s;tian Liberty; as the Con&s;equence can never be approv'd or intended, &s;o the Practice is as contrary to their Genius, as to the Dignity and Honour of human Nature. It is really a&s;toni&s;hing that &s;uch a Scene of Cruelty &s;hou'd ari&s;e from a Religion founded on the Principle of UNIVERSAL BENEVOLENCE! The A&s;toni&s;hment however will cea&s;e, when we con&s;ider, which is true in fact, that as in all Civil In&s;titu|tions, founded in Common Sen&s;e, and common Right, the Progre&s;s is from Good to Better; &s;o in all religious Sy&s;tems, founded in Super&s;tition, the Progre&s;s is from Good to Bad. The former are improv'd and perfected by Time and Experi|ence; the latter corrupted. The former begin, as Nece&s;&s;ity allows, with an imperfect A&s;&s;ociation of rude and ignorant Men; the latter always a&s;&s;umes, or pretends the mo&s;t undi&s;puted Maxims of NATURAL LAW, which ea&s;ily gaining Authority, it &s;lips gradually and un&s;u&s;pected into tho&s;e blind Engagements, which produce and e&s;tabli&s;h Tyranny. This Progre&s;&s;ion of human Affairs, which never re&s;t in a Point, is manife&s;ted by Experience. Is any thing, at this Day, more odious to a &s;in|cere Prote&s;tant, or ev'n to &s;ome <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI>, than <HI>Je&s;uiti&s;m</HI>, or than the Founder of that Sect, IGNATIUS LOYOLA? And yet perhaps his Character is mi&s;taken and mi&s;repre&s;ented by both. A curious Pa&s;&s;age in the Life of PADRE PAOLO the <HI>Venetian</HI>, will render this Opinion probable.
<Q>&startq;PADRE BOBADIGLIA was one of the TEN Companions of IGNATIUS, and living when PAOLO flouri&s;h'd. One time he freely told PAOLO that it was never the De&s;ign of his Ma&s;ter, that his Company &s;hould follow tho&s;e Maxims, which already had gained Au|thority among them. That if he could return to life again, he wou'd not know his Di&s;ciples, &s;ince in &s;o &s;hort a time, they had deviated &s;o much from their original In&s;titution, that &endq;they acted quite contrary to the Spirit and De&s;ign of it.</Q>
See here then an In&s;tance of Corruption, which grew into an In&s;titution &s;o early, as immediately upon the Death of the Founder gave occa&s;ion to one of his Di&s;ciples to complain, and, as it &s;eems, ev'n to &s;eparate him&s;elf from his Company. The Ca&s;e of BOBADIGLIA &s;eems very much to re&s;emble that of MARK the EVANGELIST, who, by refu&s;ing the Bi&s;hopric of <HI>Alexandria</HI>, &s;hew'd, that ev'n Then &s;ome Corruption had been introduc'd either into the Hi&s;tory or Doctrine of his Ma&s;ter. And indeed, if we may be allow'd to judge, and to &s;peak freely, there appears to be &s;o great a Difference, and ev'n Contrariety, between the prime Principles, and the &s;everal Parts of that In|&s;titution, that whereas the Great OUT-LINES are clearly drawn, and &s;trongly mark'd, according to TRUTH and the LAW of NATURE, they are afterwards fill'd up by tho&s;e, who writ the Hi&s;tory, and manag'd the De&s;ign, in a Manner which counteracts, and de&s;troys the original Intention. In the fir&s;t appear the great|e&s;t &s;implicity and plainne&s;s of pure THEISM; while the other is crouded and intricated with artificial Ob&s;curity, Ambiguity, and Contradiction, which grew apace into that Sy&s;tem of ob|&s;tinate Super&s;tition, which for many Ages prevailed; till in the XVI Century by the Re&s;urrection of Letters it was a little check'd and re&s;trained. So that if <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;hou'd return into the World, he wou'd hardly know his own Hi&s;tory and Doctrine, not only as it is NOW under&s;tood, but neither thro' all the inter|mediate Changes and Depravations, which have been introduced from his Death to the pre&s;ent Time.</P>
<P>The&s;e Corruptions grew at la&s;t into IMPLICIT FAITH, and INFALLIBILITY. And Padre PAOLO being at NAPLES when &s;ome Con&s;ultations were held among the CLERGY concerning the Means of &s;upporting them; BELLARMIN, afterwards CAR|DINAL, whi&s;per'd in his Ear,
<Q>&startq;The&s;e are the Things that have made GERMANY revolt, and will produce the &s;ame &endq;Revolutions in FRANCE, and in other Kingdoms.</Q>
The HIERARCHY however, in&s;tead of profiting by &s;uch Documents, continue to &s;tumble on thro' all the Mi&s;ts and Darkne&s;s of Pro|phecy, Miracles, My&s;tery, and implicit Faith; and amid&s;t the clear Light of Nature and Rea&s;on, compel us either to &s;hut our Eyes, or to acknowledge that they alone can &s;ee; while like Knights-Errant they courteou&s;ly offer them&s;elves, as Guides to conduct us thro' all the&s;e intricate Labyrin$, which they them&s;elves have contrived, and as Guardians again&s;t tho&s;e fiery Dragons, and mon&s;trous Forms, which without their Aid, and ev'n by their Command, &s;tand ready to devour us. And for this great Deliverance they require no other Reward but that with all Humility we pro&s;trate our&s;elves before the Lady of their Affection, who with IGNORANCE at her Right Hand, and at her Left CREDULITY &s;its inthroned in a Cloud of Darkne&s;s, who&s;e variable Being &s;till changing thro' numberle&s;s fanta&s;tic Forms, and &s;trange Apparitions, is known by the Name of <HI>Super&s;tition</HI>.</P></NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="foot">(440.) The Poet having &s;hew'd the Incertainty and Confu|&s;ion of Implicit FAITH, and artificial Creeds, and the univer&s;al Di&s;order of Super&s;tition and Bigotry; proceeds to &s;hew on what Foundation Belief and Knowledge may re&s;t, one in probability, the other in certainty! This Foundation is NATURE. NA|TURE is the WORK of GOD; and in his WORKS his WILL or LAW is revealed. From the&s;e therefore all real Knowledge is derived. And in Proportion as Knowledge is REAL, the SENSE of DUTY or Obligation becomes REAL al&s;o. For tho' the great CREATOR hath &s;o con&s;tituted human Nature, that all Duty and Obligation begins from SENSE, and ultimately ends in it; yet they have not their full Force and Moment, till tho&s;e SENSES, from which they ari&s;e, become the Objects of Know|ledge, and are recognis'd by Reflexion. Before &s;uch Reflexion, Duty is attended with a &s;ort of Ob&s;curity &s;omething like that which attends Implicit Faith. In this only they differ, which is indeed a great Difference, that Here the Impre&s;&s;ion is made by the Artifice of MAN, There by the Wi&s;dom of GOD. Hence it is that Brute Animals, who&s;e Sen&s;es never become to them the Objects of Rea&s;on, or Reflexion, do yet act more uniformly, and con&s;i&s;tently with Nature, than MAN, who tho' capable of &s;uch Reflexion, is yet trained by Cu&s;tom and wrong Di&s;ciplin to counteract it. And hence too appears the Nece&s;&s;ity of right Di&s;|ciplin or Education, that no Tendencies or Inclinations may be &s;uperadded to the Mind, which in their Progre&s;s may counteract Nature, but only Culture and Improvement added to tho&s;e, which in their Progre&s;s advance it to Perfection. Thus the MORAL SENSE is the fir&s;t natural Tendency to VIRTUE, which by a &s;low Progre&s;&s;ion becomes CONSCIENCE; and when by U&s;e and Di&s;cipline they Both become the Objects of Reflexion, they then con&s;titute a full and perfect Obligation. This Obligation is felt and acknowledg'd in Proportion to the Strength and Clearne&s;s of the Sen&s;e from which it is originally derived, and to the Care and Diligence employ'd in recogni&s;ing it. And hence by Repe|tition and Cu&s;tom, Con&s;cience it&s;elf becomes a Natural IN|STINCT, and &s;o by a certain and nece&s;&s;ary Power directs, controls, and regulates all the Sentiments, the Affections, and the Actions of MAN. La&s;tly, by the&s;e Steps the Mind ad|vancing in a natural Progre&s;&s;ion, &s;ees, and recogni&s;es the Great AUTHOR of NATURE; that FAITH, LOYALTY, or ALLE|GIANCE to GOD is the fir&s;t LAW, or Obligation, and the Second is CHARITY, or LOVE of MANKIND. All this our Poet proves by regular Deduction in the following Part of his Work; and concludes with our NOBLE BRITISH PHI|LOSOPHER, who in his ENQUIRY hath demon&s;trated with the greate&s;t Force of Rea&s;on, and Beauty of Expre&s;&s;ion, that PRIME TRUTH, "That ALL IS RIGHT;" and that the united Powers of PIETY and VIRTUE contain the whole Sum of human Duty and Happine&s;s.</NOTE>

This is perfect FREEDOM, agreeable to tho&s;e &s;age Ver&s;es of CLEANTHES:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an E&s;&s;ay on Happine&s;s, &amp;c. by &mdash; HARRIS.</NOTE>

<P>There &s;eems to be no other Freedom of WILL than This; which is the Con&s;ent, or Agreement of it with Con&s;cience. That is, when the WILL, or Tendency to Happine&s;s corre&s;|ponds with NATURE, or the WILL and LAW of GOD. The Re&s;i&s;tance made again&s;t this Tendency is indeed an inert, impotent, or pa&s;&s;ive Power, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">IGNAVA RATIO,</NOTE> ari&s;ing from Implicit FAITH, or receiving wrong Direction from Pa&s;&s;ion, or fal&s;e Opinion, deriv'd either from partial and imperfect Views of NATURE, or from the artificial Impediments of Super&s;tition, and Bigotry, which produce the &s;ame Effect, only in a greater Degree, and more malignant. To &s;uppo&s;e the WILL, when VICE and VIRTUE are clearly &s;een, felt and recogni&s;ed, free to chu&s;e either, is agreeable to the Doctrine of tho&s;e, who &s;uppo&s;e VIRTUE and VICE to be founded only in CUSTOM, FASHION, or arbitrary Command.

Cu&s;tom and Education may &s;trengthen, alter or corrupt the moral SENSE, but can no more create it, than the Sen&s;e of &s;ee|ing. The Mind, by a continual Effort, may perhaps attain &s;omething like the Freedom of WILLING contrary to NATURE, but this Power, or rather Impotence, which may be properly called the Deception of VICE,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is called in S. S. the DECEIVABLENESS of SIN."</NOTE> is Nothing but our own Mi&s;take, ari&s;ing from imperfect Views of NATURE; by which we are im|perceptibly led by a general Law, while we fancy our&s;elves to be guided by mere WILL; whereas our REAL FREEDOM is only a perceived Concord, or Harmony of our own WILL with the LAW of NATURE, WILL OF GOD, or divine NECESSITY. For the De&s;ires all tend to natural Objects; or if otherwi&s;e, the unnatural Tendency mu&s;t proceed either from Di&s;ea&s;e, of Vio|lence. Now if the WILL be indeed De&s;ire of Happine&s;s, it can be only a Combination of &s;ingle De&s;ires, by cu&s;tom complicated and connected, and regulated by Rea&s;on; from whence it &s;hould &s;eem to follow, that as &s;ingle De&s;ires all tend to natural Objects, &s;o the WILL al&s;o &s;hould tend to natural Objects, and not to Im|po&s;&s;ibilities. But, if &s;eeing Vice to be, what it really is, the Di&s;ea&s;e of the Mind, we &s;hould yet chu&s;e it as a Mean of Hap|pine&s;s, the WILL would then tend to Impo&s;&s;ibility; which is ab&s;urd. And this &s;hews the Vanity of Super&s;tition, and of every artificial Motive of the WILL, which mu&s;t be either fooli&s;hly, or wickedly applied, when it doth not corre&s;pond with TRUTH and NATURE.</P></NOTE>

<NOTE PLACE="foot">(475, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) There is UNITY of TRUTH, and UNITY of WILL. With Regard to the former, it may be ob&s;erved, there are no Degrees of Perception. When the SAME TRUTH is perceived by many, it is alike perceived. There are many TRUTHS, to which all Mankind have EVER a&s;&s;ented; and a Collection of the&s;e would form a CREED, which might properly be called CATHOLIC FAITH. But this UNITY is not the Purpo&s;e of ar|tificial CREEDS. Such CREEDS are u&s;ually a Collection of IR|REGULARS, or of Things, in which Mankind di&s;agree mo&s;t, and which agree lea&s;t with NATURE. Hence they become Marks of Di&s;tinction, and Motives of Di&s;cord.&mdash;UNITY of WILL centers in tho&s;e two great Principles, LOVE of GOD, and LOVE of MAN; Each of the&s;e may be con&s;idered either as Affection, or Duty. Affection is natural, and nece&s;&s;ary: and when it becomes the Object of Reflection, the Duty, or Obli|gation ari&s;ing from it, is made perfect by Recognition. The more therefore we &s;tudy, and under&s;tand the Works of GOD, Affection and con&s;equential Obligation will ari&s;e more pure, &s;trong and perfect. This, as was &s;aid before, is perfect FREEDOM. But perfect Freedom cannot be without FREE-THINKING, or a ju&s;t Knowledge of NATURE, and of the WILL, or LAW of GOD, free from artificial Re&s;traint, and mere arbitrary Impo&s;ition. And without &s;uch Freedom, no LAW, or Duty being felt, or under|&s;tood, nothing can be produced, but implicit FAITH, or Sub|mi&s;&s;ion to mere arbitrary Command, with con&s;equential Vice and Corruption. For whatever may be pretended, without &s;uch Knowledge of NATURE, Affection and con&s;equent Obligation can be derived only from Dreams, and Chimeras of Imagination, which produces Super&s;tition and Bigotry, and renders every Cor|ruption of the Mind more dangerous and malignant. Hence in private Life, every Sort of Vice grows and prevails more and more: In Religion, Di&s;cord, Hatred, and Per&s;ecution; and in States, either Tyranny and Oppre&s;&s;ion with &s;ervile Subjection; or, where &s;ome Mixture of Freedom remains, there we find the mo&s;t ju&s;t and mild Government perplexed and di&s;turbed by con|tinual Seditions, Trea&s;ons, and Rebellions. He that is not true and faithful to GOD, can never be true and faithful to MAN; and the more there is of Ju&s;tice and Truth in human Govern|ment, that is, the more it approaches to the REASON and TRUTH of divine Government, &s;o much the more the&s;e Cor|ruptions prevail, in Proportion as Super&s;tition was admitted in the original Plan of &s;uch Government, or was afterwards intro|duced and adopted by a &s;trange Sort of mon&s;trous Mixture, called "An Alliance between CHURCH and State." Now UNITY of FAITH on &s;uch a fanta&s;tical Foundation, is a mere CHIMERA&middot; All that can be done when Men affect to build &s;uch a&euml;rial Fabrics, is to give the &s;ame NAME to a THING which is continually changing, and to expre&s;s and &s;upport, by the &s;ame Ceremonies, an implicit Belief of Doctrines, which either cannot be under|&s;tood, becau&s;e my&s;terious, or cannot be believed, becau&s;e incon|&s;i&s;tent. And even this were tolerable, perhaps, if compul&s;ion were not added; and if the Managers of &s;uch artificial Sy&s;tems of FAITH and &s;upernatural Meteorology, did not explain it &s;o, as either to make it unintelligible, or to make us &s;ee, it can only &s;erve their own Purpo&s;es; which indeed are plainly enough di&s;covered in the Contrivance, and more plainly in the Execution, by gratifying PRIDE and Selfi&s;hne&s;s, and by promo|ting VICE, ERROR and DISCORD.</NOTE>

And this in the &s;ame Manner, (and unle&s;s human NATURE be much corrupted) the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity as any Wound, Brui&s;e, or Di&s;ea&s;e hurts us. The LAW of GOD executes it&s;elf. This Place is only intended again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;ub&s;tituting them&s;elves in Place of GOD, a&s;|&s;ume a Power of di&s;tributing Reward or Puni&s;hment, in an arbi|trary Manner, without Regard to TRUTH, and the LAW of NATURE.</NOTE>
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P N="594">(594, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) In &s;uch a Creature as MAN, &s;o complicated and variable, there is need of continual Caution.&mdash;The Motto of the wi&s;e Man is "CAVENDO." According to the Doctrine of the Stoics, the UNION of the WILL with TRUTH, was expre&s;s'd by the Word CONSTANCY. By WILL, they meant rational De&s;ire; by CAUTION, rational Aver&s;ion. The&s;e were tho&s;e EUPATHIES, or RIGHT FEELINGS, which include all the NA|TURAL REFLECTIONS, and having TRUTH for their Founda|tion, were permanent and con&s;tant. And thus the WILL and CONSCIENCE harmonizing with NATURE, produced that per|fect RESIGNATION to the WILL of GOD, which is the &s;upreme Good and Happine&s;s of Man. Whether this CONSTANCY, and perfect RESIGNATION doth not exceed the Power of the mo&s;t happy Genius, e&s;pecially in &s;ome dark Intervals, is more than I pretend to know, or dare affirm. The AIM however is certain|ly right; but there is need of continual CAUTION, and above all things to avoid too much AFFECTATION and SE|CURITY. Without this Caution, natural ENTHUSIASM is apt to run into PRIDE and PRESUMPTION, and either produces that high Species of FANATICISM, who&s;e Effects are too irregu|lar, and often dangerous, or into a State of rapturous INDOLENCE, and inactive QUIETISM. At pre&s;ent, indeed, the Genius of the Age &s;eems little liable to the&s;e Di&s;orders; the Current &s;eems to &s;et another Way, and we are running into a con|trary Extreme, of Selfi&s;hne&s;s, Sen&s;uality, and unmanly Vani|ties. Virtue is always be&s;t when it aims not to exceed the bounds of Nature; but when ev'n the Aim falls below that Mark, the Practi&s;e mu&s;t be proportionably wrong. We have been &s;o long influenc'd by the Chimeras of Super&s;tition to direct our Aim at &s;omething above NATURE, that it is no Wonder if in Practice we fall below it. 'Tis hard to keep the middle Point. In this there &s;eems to be too much Sim|plicity, too much Gravity, and ev'n too much Severity. All the&s;e are di&s;agreeable; but they are only &s;o, becau&s;e we are not early accu&s;tom'd to them; or becau&s;e, when we were accu&s;tom'd to them, we found them connected with incon|&s;i&s;tent CREEDS, which violated Rea&s;on, and with Vi&s;ions of Happine&s;s, which di&s;appointed Expectation. So a Fondne&s;s for Trifles &s;ucceeds a Fondne&s;s for Chimaeras; and the meer Trifle is certainly better than the &s;olemn Trifle. In com|mon Life many things &s;eem grievous by our own Fault, many by the Fault of others; all which Grievances are either cau&s;ed or promoted by Super&s;tition, and then fal&s;ely attributed to a Corruption of Nature. For the&s;e Evils we &s;eek a Re|medy in vain from Super&s;tition. It increa&s;es the Complaint. The Managers of that Craft are either too vain to be &s;in|cere, or too &s;elfi&s;h to be tru&s;ted. They ab&s;urdly pretend to guide without &s;eeing, to teach without feeling, to per&s;uade without Kindne&s;s, to exhort without Authority, and to damn without Ju&s;tice. The Doctors of this Ca&s;t &s;hew Heav'n to their Followers with a certain In&s;olence and Caprice, as Children &s;hew their Gewgaws, only to &s;et the &s;imple a long|ing, and to amaze them with the &s;ole Power and Privilege, which they pretend to have, of opening or &s;hutting tho&s;e EVER|LASTING GATES. That Moment, that awful Moment of DEATH, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides the Cruelties inflicted on the <HI>Americans</HI>, de&s;cribed afterwards, and for which (otherwi&s;e hardly credible) we have the Te&s;timony of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Bi&s;hop; the pre&s;ent Practice of the <HI>French</HI> Clergy is here hinted, who refu&s;e the Sacrament to tho&s;e who die without &s;igning a certain CREED, or Confe&s;&s;ion of FAITH.</NOTE> they watch with a &s;piteful Diligence, to traver&s;e the natural Progre&s;&s;ion of the Mind, which at THAT Time e&s;pecially &s;eems by a certain Nece&s;&s;ity to fix, and &s;ettle in perfect RESIGNATION to DEITY. How cruel mu&s;t be the Practice of tho&s;e &s;olemn Impo&s;tors, who on their own Terms, and in their own FORMS of Belief, expo&s;e Heav'n and Hell, and give, or take away at Plea&s;ure, the PEACE of GOD! while the helple&s;s Patient, with equal Pain a&s;&s;ents without Conviction, or rejects with threatn'd Damnation! This Point of View, in which BIGOTRY is &s;een in its utmo&s;t Malignity, wou'd de&s;erve to be drawn by the Hand of a M. ANGELO, or of a DANTE. One wou'd hope indeed this Subject cou'd never be realis'd in fact; but the Ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e. It was u&s;ual with tho&s;e, who fir&s;t conquer'd and converted the INDI|ANS of AMERICA, to hunt tho&s;e harmle&s;s People with Dogs, when they hid them&s;elves from their Conquerors, and rejected, it &s;eems, their Doctrine of Salvation.

<P>There are TWO Points of View, in which NATURE, or the WORKS of GOD may be &s;een or repre&s;ented.</P>
<P N="1">1. That in the Beginning MAN was created perfect; yet fell from this original State. This FALL was followed by a general Corruption of Manners derived from it, through all &s;ucceeding Ge|nerations. The Effect, or Con&s;equence extended far; for though at fir&s;t Man was made immortal, yet now he became both MOR|TAL and IMMORTAL. He was fir&s;t doomed to die, and then to live again; yet &s;o as to be mi&s;erable for EVER. This doom was irrevocable and unavoidable. Neverthele&s;s a SAVING Method was at la&s;t di&s;covered, which even from the beginning was &s;ecretly de&s;igned, and re&s;erved, as virtually, though not actually efficacious, The Method was THIS; that the SUPREME BEING who MADE MAN, &s;hould DIE for MAN; offering his LIEE, or BLOOD, as a SACRIFICE, PROPITIATION, or ATTONEMENT. That MAN by BELIEVING this SACRIFICE was made for him, &s;hould again become capable of EVERLASTING HAPPINESS. Thus GOD, by his OWN DEATH, &s;atisfied his OWN JUSTICE; and MAN became HOLY by the RIGHTEOUSNESS of GOD IMPUTED. This is called REDEMPTION. Neverthele&s;s, as &s;ome report the Ca&s;e, everla&s;ting Happine&s;s &s;till re&s;ts on a very precarious Foundation; &s;ince Man, be&s;ides BELIEVING WELL, mu&s;t LIVE WELL: which is the only Circum&s;tance, in this TRAGEDY which &s;eems to be founded in NATURE. Others affirm this Circum&s;tance of LIVING WELL is unne&s;&s;ary, and that BELIEF alone is &s;ufficient; while ALL agree that without &s;uch BELIEF VIRTUE is u&s;ele&s;s, SALVATION impo&s;&s;ible, and that ALL MANKIND yet remain under the CURSE, and &s;ubject to ETERNAL PUNISHMENT.</P>
<P N="2">2. According to the other De&s;cription, MAN was ORIGI|NALLY, as NOW, formed IMPERFECT. TIME, Opportunity, Experience, and a right U&s;e of all the&s;e are nece&s;&s;ary to unfold the NATURE of THINGS, the LAW of GOD, and the Means of HAPPINESS. Many are the Efforts of REASON in &s;uch a Creature, in &s;uch a State, blended as it is with APPETITE and PASSION, and while it grows from SENSE, confined and incumbered with it. Till at la&s;t, by a NATURAL PROGRESSION it arrives at MATURITY, &s;ees Things in a full and clear Light, and in their true Proportions; yet &s;ees at the &s;ame Time, that ALL CAN|NOT BE SEEN, but that Room is left for continual IMPROVE|MENT in an endle&s;s Progre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In this SCHEME the great WORK, with all its Movements, is progre&s;&s;ive and NATURAL; in the other RETROGRADE; re|&s;embling tho&s;e CYCLES and EPICYCLES of the Planets, by which the harmonious Simplicity, and Proportion of their Motions were perplexed and intricated. It &s;eems indeed to be a mere artificial, or &s;cenical Repre&s;entation; which being SUPERNA|TURAL, or out of the Bounds of NATURE, and full of the fal&s;e MARVELOUS, is therefore very well fitted to excite and e&s;tabli&s;h IMPLICIT FAITH; which exacts more Pains to over|look, and de&s;pi&s;e, than would be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ee, and recognize the REAL WORKS and MIRACLES of NATURE. It is there|fore no way adapted to promote the KNOWLEDGE of TRUTH, the Love of VIRTUE, the HAPPINESS of MAN, or the GLORY of GOD. On the Contrary it is adapted to promote, and in Fact ALWAYS hath promoted, ERROR and VICE, with all the con&s;equential Evils of BIGOTRY and Super&s;tition. Yet ev'n to This, which is now at la&s;t become in reality a general Cor|ruption, a wi&s;e and good Man might &s;ubmit with Patience, if omitting the u&s;ual Methods of Compul&s;ion, and Provocation, Belief were only recommended in the more ea&s;y Way of Per|&s;ua&s;ion, and free Manner of Invitation: While he might be allow'd to &s;mile, perhaps, when in &s;earch of TRUTH only, and as a &s;incere Lover of VIRTUE, he &s;hou'd &s;ee &s;o many MYSTERIES REVEALED without being under&s;tood, &s;o much Happine&s;s procur'd, without being enjoy'd, and &s;o many BI|GOTS, who believe without under&s;tanding, yet damn all who do not under&s;tand, as well as believe. For my own Part, tho' I have a great and &s;incere Regard for all Government, in which the good of Mankind is intended, and for our own in particu|lar, the Freedom and Excellence of which I gratefully acknow|ledge, yet I cannot help thinking that this very Intention of promoting COMMON GOOD is defeated by the means employ'd to effect it; and that our public Sy&s;tem, and e&s;tabli&s;hed Form of Religion, which is con&s;ider'd as the fir&s;t and chiefe&s;t of tho&s;e Means, doth it&s;elf greatly want Amendment and Refor|mation, that it may approach yet nearer to Truth; and corre|&s;pond better with the Con&s;titution of NATURE. Whether this be &s;o indeed, and if &s;o, which is the be&s;t Way of Effecting &s;uch Reformation, I leave entirely to the Judgment of our Governors. Mean Time, as our POET agrees with a noble Philo&s;opher <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BOLINGBROKE.</NOTE> in directing the Means of Happine&s;s more ac|cording to NATURE, let us follow that Direction, while we repre&s;s with equal Diligence, the PRIDE of IGNORANCE and BIGOTRY, of all MONSTERS the mo&s;t deformed, and the PRIDE of FALSE KNOWLDGE, of all Vices the mo&s;t in&s;nar|ing.
<Q>&startq;Let us pur&s;ue the Journey of Life contentedly; and learn that as the &s;ofte&s;t Pillow, on which we can lay our Heads, has been &s;aid by MONTAIGNE to be IGNORANCE, we may &s;ay more properly, that it is RESIGNATION. He alone is HAPPY, and HE is truly &s;o, who can &s;ay, Welcome &endq;Life, whatever it brings; welcome DEATH, whatever it is!</Q>
It is the Want of real FAITH, LOYALTY and ALLEGIANCE, which makes us &s;ee and feel &s;o much EVIL, while the &s;ober FREE-THINKER, and TRUE BELIEVER, committing him&s;elf to the Di&s;po&s;al of GOD, views his WORKS with Reverence and Gratitude, and &s;ees, that ev'n Now, as well as at the BE|GINNING, they are ALL VERY GOOD!</P></NOTE>
