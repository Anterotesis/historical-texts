<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was a cu&s;tom with the Grecian Fi&s;hermen of old, when they had e&s;caped an$ danger at &s;ea, to dedi|cate their little &s;kiffs to whatever Tutelary Being they attributed its pre&s;ervation; there is nothing more cer|tain, than that the ABSENT MAN is chiefly, was I not the Author my&s;elf, perhaps, I might &s;ay wholly, indebted for its &s;ucce&s;s, to your excellent performance; it is therefore, with great plea&s;ure I take this method of expre&s;&s;ing my obligations to you.</P>
<P>Indeed, when I con&s;ider your punctuality in attending the Rehear&s;als of this little Piece, though out of the common bu&s;ine&s;s of the Theatre; and the care you took, not only to be perfect your&s;elf, but that it &s;hould be, in every re&s;pect, produced as complete as po&s;&s;ible; I can|not help congratulating all our pre&s;ent Writers for the Stage, on the acqui&s;ition of a performer of &s;uch uncom|mon merit; and &s;o great a favourite with the Public; who, they may be a&s;&s;ured, will con&s;ider their advantage and reputation, as well as his own; and do their pieces, at lea&s;t, all the ju&s;tice they are capable of receiving.</P>
<P>Had I an inclination to indulge my&s;elf in the Dedica|tory Stile. I might now tell you, with truth, that few men have filled &s;o many Characters with the &s;ame pro|priety that you have; but I leave this to &s;ome News|paper E&s;&s;ayi&s;t, who may be fond of playing upon mean|ings and wo$$s; and vary your appearance upon the Theatre how you plea&s;e, I will venture to &s;ay, your acquaintance in private life, will always find you an hone&s;t and &s;en&s;ible, and a gentleman like man.</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>I am, Sir, with great e&s;teem, your obliged, humble &s;ervant.</SALUTE></CLOSER>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS farce was written &s;ome years ago, &s;ince which time it has lain by the Author, without being offered to the &s;tage; nor &s;hould he have ventured it there at all, but to &s;erve Mr. Holland, at his benefit; upon which occa&s;ion, he thought the Publick, through favour to &s;o de&s;erving a performer, would be willing to be plea&s;ed with any thing.</P>
<P>The event has greatly exceeded his hopes; the farce was not only received with general approbation the fir&s;t night, but that &s;ort of approbation which a writer may depend upon with greate&s;t &s;afety.</P>
<Q><L>"For &s;miles are hone&s;t when the hands are not;"</L></Q>
<P>And on the &s;econd night, it met with marks of fa|vour &s;till more manife&s;t; this engaged the author to look over it with greater care than he had before done, and having heightened &s;ome places where he thought it mo&s;t deficient, he now &s;ubmits it to the public, in a form, in which, he hopes it will not utterly di&s;plea&s;e, though it is needle&s;s to &s;ay that things of this kind have their principal merit in repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>Regnard one of the mo&s;t famous French comic poets, ranked by his countrymen next to Moliere, has written a play of five acts upon this &s;ubject, called, le DIS|TRAIT; however, exclu&s;ive of their great di&s;parity in merit; no two pieces can be le&s;s alike than that, and the ABSENT MAN; at lea&s;t, where the materials have been drawn from the &s;ame &s;ource. The DISTRAIT of Regnard is exactly the Menalcas of La Bruyere's charac|ters, a few things only left out, which, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a plea&s;ant extravagance in recital&punc; would be too ab&s;urd for actual repre&s;entation; the hint of the ABSENT MAN, and no more, is taken from the &s;ame character of Menalcas, tran&s;lated in one of the num|bers of the Spectator; with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of which, if the pre&s;ent writer has been able to produce a laughable farce, it is all he aimed at, and he pretends to no more prai&s;e than &s;uch a trifling compo&s;ition may de&s;erve.</P>

<LG>
<L>ERE the curtain draws up, li&s;t a little to me:</L>
<L>Are you all in a very good humour? Let's &s;ee;</L>
<L>Good humour you have, howe'er you come by it,</L>
<L>And I'm glad to my &s;oul; for, by Jove we &s;hall try it.</L>
<L>Our farce is &s;o very a farce, I'm in doubt,</L>
<L>If the pit and the boxes; will &s;uffer it out;</L>
<L>But when we're in danger of &s;uch a mi&s;hap,</L>
<L>My dear friends above, drown their hi&s;s in a clap;</L>
<L>And if you are pleas'd with our farcical man,</L>
<L>In &s;pite of their airs, laugh as loud as you can.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To give you a &s;ketch, now, by way of portraying,</L>
<L>His character's this&mdash;pray ob&s;erve what I'm &s;aying;</L>
<L>An odd kind of whim&s;ical blundering being,</L>
<L>Who has ears without hearing, and eyes without &s;eeing;</L>
<L>Takes things by all handles, except by the right,</L>
<L>A&s;k a que&s;tion in black, he an&s;wers in white.</L>
<L>Yes for no, no for yes; confu&s;es, mi&s;takes;</L>
<L>All he does &s;o like dreaming&punc; you'd &s;carce think he wakes.</L>
<L>Suppo&s;e to back-gammon my gentleman falls,</L>
<L>Box and dice in his hand&punc; for &s;ome water he calls;</L>
<L>'Tis brought in a tumbler, when pop, in a trice,</L>
<L>He throws out the liquor, and &s;wallows the dice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hard &s;et are poor bards for your plea&s;ure to cater,</L>
<L>And thus one provides for you, from the Spectator;</L>
<L>From volume the fir&s;t, page three hundred and nine,</L>
<L>Number &s;eventy-&s;even he takes his de&s;ign;</L>
<L>Let that be his &s;anction for what you behold&punc;</L>
<L>Can the figure be bad from &s;o perfect a mold?</L>
<L>'Tis poli&s;h'd and varni&s;h'd as well as he's able,</L>
<L>And he hopes you'll find &s;omething like conduct and fable.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet &s;till this cur&s;t ab&s;ence&mdash;in &s;hortt here's the thing,</L>
<L>If the character hits, thence his actions all &s;pring;</L>
<L>And nought will di&s;gu&s;t you, and nought will alarm you,</L>
<L>You'll ta&s;te ev'ry blunder, $is follies will charm you;</L>
<L>But if&mdash;Gad we're all in a terrible fright,</L>
<L>So, begging for mercy, I wi&s;h you good night.</L>

<P>Yes, &s;ure, Sir, very well, and I thought he had known it him&s;elf; but it &s;eems I was mi&s;taken.</P>

<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Seriou&s;ly, I am afraid &s;ome accident has happened to him.</P>

<P>No, Sir, I don't believe any accident has happened to him.</P>

<P>What's your opinion then?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I need not tell you, Sir, that my ma&s;ter is, one or other, the mo&s;t ab&s;ent man this day upon the face of the earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, I have often heard him remarked for it; nay, I have my&s;elf taken notice of &s;everal glaring in&s;tances of it in him; but, that is a failing he will &s;oon get the better of when his thoughts are pro|perly employed; and matrimony&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will in all likelihood perfectly cure him. 'Tis granted, Sir, matrimony is without doubt an excellent remedy, in &s;uch di&s;tempers; a kind of manna and cream of tartar; a mixture of &s;weet and &s;ower; wonderfully adapted to purge the mind of it's gro&s;s humours, and reduce the under&s;tanding to a perfect regularity of con&s;titution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>A good comical fellow this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you cannot expect that the patient &s;hould recover, Sir, before you have admini&s;ter'd the remedy you intend to pre&s;cribe for his di&s;ea&s;e: there|fore, you mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed if my ma&s;ter happens to labour under a very violent fit of his out of the way malady, at this pre&s;ent moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Neither more, nor le&s;s, than that he has forgot he was to be married to your daughter to night, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forgot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>As &s;ure as can be he has Doctor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir, forgot&mdash;and given the reins to his wild imagination, &s;uffer'd it to run away with him the Lord knows whither. Why, Sir, when he is in the forgetting mood, his memory is a perfect &s;ieve&mdash;Any thing will fall thro' it&mdash;I have known him forget his own name before now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am unwilling to think my friend Shatter|brain de&s;ign'd to affront me&mdash;But if his memory was a &s;ieve, to which you compare it, that only
<PB N="10" REF="9">
yields a pa&s;&s;age to minuter particle$, while the more gro&s;s remain behind&mdash;And an affair of con|&s;equence, like&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Sir! I could tell you &s;uch &s;tories of him, as would make you credit this with very little difficulty&mdash;for in&s;tance, the other day&punc; he was &s;it|ting in a coffee-hou&s;e, when a fly which had buzz'd about him a good while, and he was watching an $$|portunity to kill, unluckily &s;ettled upon the cheek of a per&s;on who &s;tood near him&mdash;Ha! &s;ays he, I believe I have you now; and with that, Sir, he up with his hand, and hit the poor gentleman &s;uch a confounded &s;lap, as made the room ring again; one &s;tarted, the other &s;tared; in &s;hort, &s;words were drawn, and the ca&s;e would in&s;allibly have been transferred to Hyde Park, had not the acquaintance on both &s;ides interpo&s;ed; &s;o he begged pardon, confe&s;&s;ed he did not know what he was doing; it ended in a hearty laugh, and the general a&s;toni&s;hment of the whole company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>About a fortnight ago, Sir, he locked up a lady, and a gentleman, in his bed-chamber here, in the way of a joke only; was call'd down about &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s; forgot it by the time he came to the foot of the &s;tairs, went out with the key in his pocket, and it was &s;ix o'clock before we could &s;et the pound|ed couple at liberty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>His ideas are &s;o confu&s;ed, &s;ometimes, Sir, that I have known him write a letter to one per&s;on, direct it to another, and &s;end it to a third, who could not devi&s;e who it came from; becau&s;e, he had forgot to put his name to the bottom on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Land.</SPEAKER>
<P>A beggar takes off his hat to him in the &s;treet, in hopes of receiving an alms; Mr. Shatter|brain makes him a low bow, tells him, he's his mo&s;t obedient humble &s;ervant, and walks on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the be&s;t thing I have heard of him a good while, was, what he did lately at a gentleman's hou&s;e in the city; where taking his leave with an intention to go away, in one of his ab&s;ent &s;its, he mounted up three pair of &s;tairs into the ga$ret; the maids that by chance were ironing there&punc; wonder'd what the plague kept &s;uch a &s;tamping about the
<PB N="11" REF="10">
rooms, when one of them taking a candle to &s;ee what it was, found my poor ma&s;ter; who, in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, told her&punc; he fancy'd he had made &s;ome mi&s;take, and begg'd to know if that was not the way to the &s;treet door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I don't know; but, if his pre&s;ent behaviour proceeds from his forgetfulne&s;s, it is the mo&s;t extraordinary in&s;tance of the kind that ever was heard of; and, how &s;hall I proceed in this ca&s;e; my daughter is at home ready dre&s;&s;ed; the lawyer will be there pre&s;ently with the writings; I have taken out a lience; appointed the clergyman to come and marry them; how &s;hall I put it off after this, with|out making us all ridiculous?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>'Tis very true, Sir, I am &s;ure I have been at my wits end about it all day.</P>

<P>So do I with all my heart; for, on many accounts, I would not wi&s;h to have my daughter's marriage delay'd; her own indi&s;cretion, Madam, has occa&s;ioned me to treat her with a &s;everity of late, very irk&s;ome both to her&s;elf and me.</P>
