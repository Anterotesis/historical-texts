<HEAD>TO THE QUEEN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Maje&s;ty has &s;o often declar'd Your ju&s;t Con|cern for the Nations Lo&s;s, and Your Value for the Memory of the late King: You have &s;o publickly approv'd his Conduct, &s;o vi&s;ibly mov'd in the &s;ame Steps, and pur&s;u'd the wi&s;e Mea&s;ures of this <HI>Your Glorious Ance&s;tor,</HI> that it cannot be thought di&s;plea&s;ing to Your Maje&s;ty, to reprehend tho&s;e who make a Mock at the Sorrow of Your Maje&s;ty and Three Nations.</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty was the fir&s;t who told us <HI>he cou'd not be &s;uffi|ciently lamented.</HI> May tho&s;e who are not of the &s;ame Mind find no Favour with Your Maje&s;ty, nor their Maker, till they repent that Sin against his Merit, and the Voice of their Na|tive Country.</P>
<P>Here are no Reflections upon Your Maje&s;ties <HI>Hou&s;hold,</HI> or <HI>Council,</HI> or <HI>Courts of Ju&s;tice,</HI> or <HI>either Hou&s;e of Parliament,</HI> and con&s;equently no Offence against Your Royal Proclamation. 'Twou'd be an Affront to Your Maje&s;ty to imagine there were any under all tho&s;e Heads of Your Government cou'd de&s;erve the Reproof of the following <HI>Satyr.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="3">
Your Maje&s;ty has an entire Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Hearts of Your People, but their Affection is &s;till the deeper rooted by that generous Sorrow you have expre&s;s'd for the Lo&s;s of him to whom they owe the full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Liberty under Your Government.</P>
<P>How they can be faithful Subjects to Your Maje&s;ty that were not $ue Friends to &s;uch a King, is a My&s;tery out of humane &V;nder&s;tanding, &s;ince the Happine&s;s we enjoy by Your Govern|ment proceeds from his defending us again&s;t tho&s;e <HI>who wou'd not have had Your Maje&s;ty to Reign over us.</HI></P>
<P>'Twou'd be a Crime again&s;t Your Maje&s;ty, which de&s;erv'd no Pardon to &s;uggest you &s;hou'd be offended at that part of the <HI>Satyr</HI> which points at our Immoralities: Your Maje&s;ties Example, as well as Command, has encourag'd us all to <HI>de|clare War</HI> again&s;t Vice, and there we are &s;ure of Your Royal Protection.</P>
<P>For the re&s;t, if an extraordinary Concern for the Glorious Memory of the late King has led the Author into any Exce&s;&s;es, he begs Your Maje&s;ty wou'd place it to the Account of that <HI>ju&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> every hone&s;t Man retains for his extraordinary Merit; believing that no Man can have an Indifferency for the Me|mory of <HI>King William,</HI> and at the &s;ame time have any De&s;ire for the Welfare of his Native Country.</P>
<P>While Your Maje&s;ty pur&s;ues the true Intere&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> the Prote&s;tant Religion, and the Welfare of <HI>Europe,</HI> as he did, you will have the &s;ame Enemies that he had, the &s;ame to oppo&s;e You abroad, and reproach You at home; but You will thereby engage all Your honest Subjects to adhere the firmer to their Duty, all Your Prote&s;tant Neighbours to depend upon Your Protection, and God &s;hall Crown Your Maje&s;ty and the&s;e Nations with His Special Favour and Benediction.</P>
