<L>Su&s;pends this mortal coil, when Mem'ry wakes,</L>
<L>When for our pa&s;t mi&s;doings Con&s;cience takes</L>
<L>A deep revenge, when, by Reflexion led,</L>
<L>She draws his curtains, and looks comfort dead,</L>
<L>Let ev'ry Mu&s;e be gone; in vain He turns</L>
<L>And tries to pray for &s;leep; an Aetna burns,</L>
<L>A more than Aetna in his coward brea&s;t,</L>
<L>And Guilt, with vengeance arm'd, forbids him re&s;t,</L>
<L>Tho' &s;oft as Plumage from young Zephyr's wing,</L>
<L>His couch &s;eems hard, and no relief can bring.</L>
<L>INGRATITUDE hath planted daggers there,</L>
<L>No Good Man can de&s;erve, no brave Man bear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, or in any better way They $$$ea&s;e,</L>
<L>With the&s;e great Men, or with great Men like the&s;e,</L>
<L>Let Them their appetite for laughter feed;</L>
<L>I on my Journey all Alone proceed.</L>
