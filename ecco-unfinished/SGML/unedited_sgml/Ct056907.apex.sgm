<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE Jacobite CLUBS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_CLUBS are a &s;ort of <HI>Con|venticles,</HI> wherein Men a&s;|&s;emble together according to that agreement which is between their &s;everal Tem|pers and Inclinations, and may properly be &s;aid to fall under the Pro|tection of the Act of <HI>Toleration.</HI> But tho' this Act was made for the Benefit of &s;uch as are <HI>Scrupulous</HI> in their Con&s;cience, and &s;epa|rate them&s;elves on account of a certain Ten|derne&s;s of a&s;&s;enting to Principles which the Generality of the People entertain, and abide by, yet it never was intended to Counte|nance any Per&s;ons what&s;oever, in their De|fection from Opinions that are almo&s;t uni|ver&s;ally receiv'd, and who have no manner of Grounds for their <HI>Scruples.</HI> The <HI>Creatures</HI> therefore, who&s;e Atchievements I have taken upon me to give the Reader the Recital of, being

thus excluded from that Indulgence which the Law has granted to other Di&s;&s;enters, 'tis to be hoped that it will be no Tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion of the Law, to drag them out of their unju&s;tifiable Retirements, to unca&s;e them of their pretended Zeal and Affection for the Wellfare and Tranquillity of their Country, and make known what they <HI>are,</HI> that they may no longer be taken for what they <HI>are not.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are the Mi&s;creants, that are &s;aid in &s;acred Writ to cry <HI>Peace, Peace, when there is no Peace,</HI> and to the&s;e &s;hould be apply'd the Words of the In&s;pired Penman, WHAT PEACE, AS LONG AS THE WHORE|DOMS OF YOUR MOTHER <HI>JEZE|BEL,</HI> AND HER WITCHCRAFTS ARE SO MANY? <HI>As long as the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of Popery and Slavery is what you propo&s;e to your &s;elves, by an end of the War, and you have nothing le&s;s in view, than the publick Tranquillity to ari&s;e from it?</HI> Not that they are harden'd into &s;uch an Effrontery of Im|pudence, as yet, to dare openly avow the&s;e horrid and traiterous Conclu&s;ions, or have contracted &s;uch an Indolence of Apprehen|&s;ion, as not to &s;kin over the&s;e Ulcerous Hopes and Expectations, with Films and Appearan|ces of Loyalty to Her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty: But &s;ince &s;ome among them, and tho&s;e Men of no &s;mall Figure and Quality, have lately taken the Liberty, in Defyance of our Acts

of Settlement, to ridicule, and &s;et at Nought the Anniver&s;ary of the next Prote&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;or in one of the Publick Prints, without Impunity, it is highly to be feared, they will not only &s;oon pull off their Di&s;gui&s;e, but declare them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner, as may be of the wor&s;t Con&s;equence to the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, without it's timely Intervention in behalf of our Religion, Li|berties, and Laws, without which we &s;hould be in the Condition of our Neighbours who are <HI>govern'd with Scorpions, and rul'd with Rods of Iron.</HI></P>
<P>To prevent this, Application &s;hould be made to tho&s;e that &s;it at Helm, and have the Sterage of the Admini&s;tration, which can be done after no better Manner than in Print, &s;ince it cannot be &s;uppos'd that tho&s;e Patri|ots who are &s;o diligent in their Enquiries after pa&s;t Mi&s;managements and Abu&s;es, will be anywi&s;e remi&s;s in their Animadver&s;ions upon tho&s;e that are Pre&s;ent, and of a few Days Growth.

<P>I am here to be under&s;tood, to &s;peak of &s;uch Wretches only as are in the <HI>St. Ger|mains</HI> Intere&s;t, and who, contrary to <HI>Oaths</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;ociations,</HI> to <HI>Prote&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Abjurations,</HI> are in League, to Pray, Eat, and Drink, for the Pro&s;perity of that Family, for I &s;hould do them Wrong to affirm any of them have Courage enough to Fight for it, &s;ince if they had, they would have long &s;ince been el&s;e|where, and either number'd among&s;t the Dead, that lo&s;t their Lives ingloriou&s;ly in Taking up Arms again&s;t their own Country, or among the poor Indigent Living, who comfort them&s;elves with Starving (as they &s;ay) for Con&s;cience &s;ake, while that Con|&s;cience of theirs permits them to go Hand in Hand, and join Hearts with a Religion contrary to the Faith they were Educated in.</P>
<P>Thus far by Way of Introduction, what

re&s;ts upon my Pur&s;uit, is to give my Reader the Detail of Occurrences that come fre&s;h into my Memory relating to the Clubs I &s;tand engag'd to furni&s;h him with. In Or|der to this, I hold my &s;elf under a Nece&s;&s;ity of Acquainting him, that tho' many Socie|ties of this Nature were held long before the <HI>Peace,</HI> now upon the Anvil, was &s;o much as thought of, in&s;omuch as even to be ante|cedent to the Proclamation of the War, which is now under a Ce&s;&s;ation between us and the Common Enemy; yet, upon the Approach of this <HI>Vi&s;ionary</HI> Ble&s;&s;ing, (for I hope it will be no otherwi&s;e to the Per&s;ons I am treating of) the Malecontents, who en|vied the late Harmony between Us and our Allies, and, without any Cau&s;e, gave in|to the Belief that &s;ome Mi&s;under&s;tandings which had unhappily ri&s;en between them and us, would widen and increa&s;e upon our going into Mea&s;ures without them, and to &s;hew their Joy more, for what &s;eem'd in their Opinion, and only their, (&s;ince the Court had other Sentiments) to be productive of another War, than their Contentment in the &s;peedy Conclu&s;ion of the pre&s;ent, con|&s;ulted together how to try their Strength, and make an E&s;timate of the Number of People that were of the &s;ame Complection with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Accordingly, when their Friend <HI>Abel,</HI> who pretended to know more of the &s;ecret

Springs of Affairs than tho&s;e who Conducted them, and would be thought to be let into the mo&s;t private Articles of the Negotiation, had given his <HI>Ip&s;e dixit,</HI> that the Queen had ratify'd the Treaty between <HI>Great Britain, France,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and was &s;o particular, as to &s;ay that Mr. <HI>Thornborough,</HI> the Me&s;&s;enger, was order'd over with the Ratification to the <HI>French</HI> Court, and that the Peace was to be proclaim'd on the 25th of <HI>September,</HI> (a New Throne being provided in the Hou&s;e of Lords, for Her Maje&s;ty to declare the Terms of it to Her Parliament,) the&s;e <HI>A&s;&s;em|bly-Men,</HI> for they are more properly &s;o cal|led than the <HI>Whiggs,</HI> thought it high Time to exert them&s;elves, and cheat the Govern|ment into an Opinion of their Loyalty and Allegiance to their Sovereign, their Gra|titude to the Mini&s;try, and their Love to their Country. All Heads and Hands were at Work, for this Purpo&s;e, in every Quarter of the Town, but none &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves more than tho&s;e who gave Notice in Print, of their Politick De&s;igns to <HI>Eat</HI> and <HI>Drink</HI> upon this <HI>Glorious</HI> Occa&s;ion.

and maugre all his Obligations to that Noble Family, and his Engagements in Point of Honour and Con&s;cience, turn'd Renegado, un&s;aid what he had before given out in Print in their Behalf, and like his own <HI>Jack</HI> and <HI>Martin,</HI> in his Celebrated <HI>Tale of a Tub</HI> that inveigh'd again&s;t <HI>Peter</HI> for all his kind Offices to them, turn'd <HI>Grumble|tonian,</HI> and from that Day forward commenc'd <HI>Malecontent</HI> to his Lord&s;hip only, till he was found to be a Fool fit for &s;ome Body el&s;e his Purpo&s;e. And then he had Money put in his Pocket, Promi&s;es of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Preferments, and what not, made him to write again&s;t the Party that Noble Peer bravely e&s;pous'd; which he has very &s;tre|nuou&s;ly done, as far as the mo&s;t flagrant Un|truths, and the mo&s;t inveterate Rancour of a poi&s;on'd and inflam'd Pen could direct him.</P>

Tho&s;e Parliaments had all the Power that it was po&s;&s;ible for a Parliament to have; and this has not; <HI>for Example,</HI> The Parliament of <HI>Great Britain</HI> is limited by the Articles by which it is Con&s;tituted: The&s;e Articles, tho&s;e Parliaments had Power to make, this had not Power to make them, for it had not then a Being; neither can this Parliament act beyond tho&s;e Articles, but is limited and pre&s;crib'd by them.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, indeed, That the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament can di&s;&s;olve tho&s;e Articles: <HI>I de|ny that;</HI> if the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament &s;hould now declare the Union di&s;&s;olved, and the Articles of it void, yet would not that Union be Le|gally Di&s;&s;olved, nor the Articles of it void, for nothing can de&s;troy what it did not make. It is true, that by Declaring the Union di&s;|&s;olv'd, it would become <HI>Felo de &s;e,</HI> and de|&s;tory its own Being as a Parliament: It is in any Man's Power to de&s;troy him&s;elf, but he has not a Right to do it: There is a great Di&s;tinction to be made between Power and Right. Upon this Foot I &s;ay, it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to alter the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, of which
<PB N="35" REF="34">
the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion is now made a Part, becau&s;e the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament cannot alter the Union: When I &s;ay CANNOT, and <HI>Impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> &amp;c. I am to be under&s;tood <HI>cannot</HI> LEGALLY, and <HI>impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> LEGALLY: For the Parliament may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to be unable to do what they cannot Legally do; &s;o that the Meaning is, they cannot do it, without Trampling under Foot the <HI>Con&s;ti|tution</HI> and the <HI>Law,</HI> which is the Founda|tion of their very Being, and I will never charge a Parliament with doing this, till I &s;ee it in their profe&s;s'd Re&s;olutions; much le&s;s a Mini&s;try, with intending it to be done, who are liable to fall under the Cognizance of a Parliament for &s;uch a De&s;ign. For I would fain know on what Foundation do the Mini&s;try &s;tand, but on that of the <HI>Pro|te&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion:</HI> I look upon it Originally to be a Plot of the <HI>Jacobites</HI> upon the <HI>Mi|ni&s;try,</HI> and upon the Nation too, to &s;ugge&s;t tho&s;e that &s;it at the Helm of the Admini&s;tra|tion are for the <HI>Pretender,</HI> either to gain upon the Populace by the Prevalence of their Example, or to Arm the People again&s;t them, on a Suppo&s;ition of their being Guilty, and then force them to fall in with the <HI>Preten|der.</HI> But <HI>it will not do.</HI> When <HI>this Mini|&s;try</HI> declares for the <HI>Pretender,</HI> they mu&s;t ei|ther be driven to &s;ome inextricable Laby|rinth in their Affairs, or be for&s;aken of God and their Under&s;tanding; &s;ince it is evident
<PB N="36" REF="35">
the Mini&s;try can have no Pro&s;pect of their own Settlement but in <HI>Peace,</HI> which mu&s;t exclude the Hopes of the <HI>Pretender.</HI> The Univer&s;al Quiet of their Affairs, is the Se|curity of their Standing, and the Steps which they have taken to put an End to the War Abroad, te&s;tify that they are con|vinced of this Truth.</P>
<P>Now, &s;ince it is evident, that the <HI>Preten|der</HI> is foreclo&s;ed by Law; not the Queen, not the Parliament, le&s;s the Mini&s;try, lea&s;t of all the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, can Repeal or make Void that Foreclo&s;ure: By Law we are Empower'd to defend it if Attack'd by Violence: <HI>Where then,</HI> Starts up an An|tagoni&s;t and &s;ays, <HI>is our Danger?</HI> I an&s;wer, We are in no Vi&s;ible Danger, but in the &s;ubtle Party deluding the People to act again&s;t them&s;elves, and to Imbibe <HI>Anti-Hanoverian</HI> Principles to di&s;cover Indiffe|rencies to one, and Aver&s;ions to another, and &s;o to weaken tho&s;e Hands which may be at la&s;t wanting to re&s;i&s;t Illegal Violences and U&s;urpations. Then may we be ruin'd by our own Hands, and the Succe&s;&s;ion blindly ruind by tho&s;e who &s;hould defend it: And for this Rea&s;on, it is every Hone&s;t Mans Duty to prevent the Common People being impos'd upon, I mean &s;uch, all &s;uch as are in &s;ubordinate Stations, and keep off a Blow that Threatens us from another
<PB N="37" REF="36">
Quarter than from the Peace or the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>To you then, good People, who are amus'd about the <HI>Pretender,</HI> when they cant about his Illegitimacy not being prov'd; when the Per&s;ons who re&s;ort to the <HI>Clubs</HI> I have been &s;peaking of, tell you of his being turn'd Prote&s;tant; when you hear of the Ju&s;tice in your Neighbourhood, that drinks his Health; the Par&s;on that Toa&s;ts him under borrow'd Names and by Innu|endo prays for him; the Soldier that wi&s;hes him Succe&s;s with a great Oath that makes as much Noi&s;e as a Bomb, do your &s;elves the Kindne&s;s but to a&s;k tho&s;e Gentlemen this Que&s;tion, <HI>Pray Sirs have you not Abjured him?</HI> If they &s;ay no. Enquire how He came to be in the Commi&s;&s;ion; He a Soldier in the Army, or he a Mini&s;ter in the Pari&s;h. And if they have Abjured him, a&s;k them how they can talk of his Legita|macy, drink his Health, pray for him, and the like.</P>
<P>Was ever poor deluded Nation &s;o Re|ligiou&s;ly mock'd as this? What do the&s;e People think of Oaths? Alas, an <HI>Abju|ration</HI> is a quite different Thing from an Oath of <HI>Allegiance.</HI> When you Swear TO a Prince, it is one Thing, and that Oath has been, and may be, determin'd
<PB N="38" REF="37">
to be of no Force, when that Prince can no longer po&s;&s;e&s;s the Sovereignty: But to Swear again&s;t a Prince, is quite another Thing. There you promi&s;e peaceable Behaviour, and it is accepted in the u&s;ual Manner: But here you call God to Witne&s;s, that you never will &s;ub|mit to him, and that he has no manner of Right to demand it. From whence I argue, That although Allegiance may be tran&s;pos'd from one Prince to another, as Countries and Cities change Ma&s;ters, which is frequent in the Ca&s;e of Towns being Taken and Re-taken in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the Inhabitants always take an Oath to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. Yet when once a Nation Swears and calls God to Witne&s;s, that they will never &s;ubmit to, or con&s;ent to be Govern'd by &s;uch or &s;uch a Prince, &s;uch an Oath can never be di&s;pens'd with, no, not the <HI>Pope</HI> him&s;elf can ab&s;olve from it, but that Na|tion &s;tands convicted of the wor&s;t Sort of Per|jury, nor can any Argument be brought to Pailiate or Excu&s;e it.</P>
<P>Now let our People but con&s;ider, this Per&s;on we call the <HI>Pretender,</HI> is the very &s;ame we have all, except an Incon&s;iderable Number of Worthle&s;s Creatures, Abjur'd; You have lifted up your Hands to God, and Sworn by him that <HI>Liveth for</HI> ever, that this very Man &s;hall never <HI>Reign over you,</HI> How will you come off of this Oath&punc; It is not a Common Oath of Allegiance that Ends with any National Revolution; no, it is a Solemn Renouncing of your Allegiance to him for ever, and calling God to Witne&s;s again&s;t your Perjury, if ever you Submit to his Obedience.</P>
<P>Not all the Devils in <HI>Hell,</HI> nor all the Je&s;uits on Earth, can contrive a Shift for you to get of
<PB N="39" REF="38">
from this Oath; not the Cunninge&s;t Sophi&s;ter under Heaven can bring you out of it. You cannot &s;ay it was a Force upon you, for you &s;wear in it you do it <HI>freely,</HI> Voluntarily, and of your <HI>own Choice:</HI> You cannot pretend the Death of the Queen quits you of it, for it is not an Oath to Her, but <HI>again&s;t him:</HI> Nothing can ab&s;olve you from it, there is not one Hole to Creep out at, no|thing to vacate the Obligation, unle&s;s you will all turn Papi&s;ts, get the Pope to Ab&s;olve you, and Di|&s;pence with it.</P>
<P>Thus National Perjury is the fir&s;t thing that mu&s;t attend your bringing in the <HI>Pretender:</HI> National Apo&s;tacy is the next, for the <HI>Pretender</HI> and <HI>Popery</HI> are the &s;ame. They &s;ay, indeed, that he is turn'd <HI>Pro|te&s;tant:</HI> Pray, why then are all the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> in <HI>Eng|land</HI> for the bringing him in? Do you think they would &s;ide with an Apo&s;tate? For &s;uch they mu&s;t account him to be: Would they be for one that &s;hould for&s;ake their Church, and revolt to Here&s;ie? They would as &s;oon take Part with a Jew as &s;uch a King&mdash;But they know well enough what &s;uch a Conver&s;ion means, what it &s;ignifies, and how far it will extend.</P>
<P>Wherefore, good People, depend upon this, that to receive the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and to receive <HI>Popery,</HI> is the very &s;ame thing, and no appearing Change in the Per&s;on can give Satisfaction in that Parti|cular.</P>
<P>National Di&s;honour comes in the Third Place, the Shame of a Blinded infatuated People, a Na|tion that may be drawn into a Snare before your Face; Will ye be called Fools fir&s;t, and then made Fools? This is to be more Sotti&s;h than the Fowls of the Air: The Text, &s;ays of them, <HI>Surely in vain is the Net &s;pread in the Sight of any Bird:</HI> But this
<PB N="40" REF="39">
Net is &s;pread in your &s;ight, and yet you run Head|long into it.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Why all this yielded to a baffled, de+feated Enemy, that has tryed 24 Years to beat you into it, and cannot do it? An Enemy you have brought &s;o low, that &s;ome &s;ay, it is not &s;afe to let him be brought any lower; and will you let him Ma&s;ter you thus? Has he Fought &s;o many Years to bring in the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and been lu&s;tily thra&s;h'd for his Pains, and &s;hall he Wheedle you in at la&s;t by his Agents to do it your &s;elves? This would be very hard, but if you will not Hear, if you will not Look about you, but be Deaf to all manner of Exhortation, the Pope's Bene|diction is the propere&s;t for you; <HI>Si Populus vult decipi decipiatur,</HI> if the Nation will be gull'd into irretrievable Mi&s;takes, let it be &s;o. <HI>Liberavi Animam meam,</HI> I have done my Duty; and at your Doors the Fault will lie, for not doing yours.</P>
