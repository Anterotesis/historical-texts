<HEAD>THE
PUBLISHER
TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>CV&s;tom having made a Preface or Epi&s;tle to the Reader almo&s;t nece&s;&s;a|ry,
I &s;hall &s;o far comply as to give &s;ome &s;hort Account of the follow|ing
Treati&s;es. The Reputation of the Author is &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;h'd,
that I &s;hall wave all that might be &s;aid upon that Head, and only de&s;ire the
Reader to ob&s;erve, that &s;oon after his Decea&s;e, his Papers were, by his Re|lations,
committed to my care to Publi&s;h what I thought might prove ac|ceptable
to the Learned, which I have endeavour'd in this Volume.</P>
<P>The Tracts here Publi&s;h'd are for the mo&s;t part Lectures, made and read
by him at &s;everal di&s;tant times upon different Subjects, which the Reader
is here pre&s;ented with as the Author left them; for I was unwilling to Mo|del
or Methodize them a new, by reducing the Subjects and Di&s;cour&s;es of
many Lectures into one continu'd Di&s;cour&s;e, as his method has been in
the Treati&s;es formerly Publi&s;h'd by him in Quarto; much le&s;s have I ven|tur'd
upon any Epitome, Abridgments too often di&s;torting and curtailing
the Author's true Sen&s;e, and di&s;gui&s;ing it &s;o, that his own Sentiments are
hard to be di&s;tinguish'd and always dubious, which Errors I have de&s;ir'd as
much as po&s;&s;ible to &s;hun. I am &s;en&s;ible, by publi&s;hing his Di&s;cour&s;es thus at
large, &s;ome Recapitulations have been unavoidable, e&s;pecially in Di&s;cour&s;es
of this Nature, which it is po&s;&s;ible may di&s;gu&s;t &s;ome nice Criticks; never|thele&s;s
I hope the Canded Reader will not find the&s;e Repetitions &s;o many or
large, as to be di&s;&s;atisfy'd thereat, mo&s;t, if not all of them, containing &s;ome
new Matter added to what was &s;aid before.</P>
<P>The Subjects here handl'd are &s;ome of the mo&s;t difficult in <HI>Natural Phi|lo&s;ophy,</HI>
and the Di&s;cour&s;es were all well accepted and approv'd of when
read before competent Judges of the <HI>ROYAL SOCIETY,</HI> at their u&s;ual
Meetings.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t contains a general Scheme or Draught of a method of advanc|ing
and promoting <HI>Natural Philo&s;ophy,</HI> &s;hewing its pre&s;ent deficiency,
with the &s;everal Queries to be made, and how they may be an&s;wer'd to ren|der
it more in&s;tructive and beneficial. It mu&s;t be granted the la&s;t and chief
Part of this <HI>Phy&s;ical Algebra,</HI> or <HI>New Organ,</HI> viz. The method of
ranging the Experiments and Ob&s;ervations in order, &s;o as to frame and
rai&s;e <HI>Axioms</HI> from them is wanting (which I believe was never wrote by the
Author) however I make no doubt but what is here offer'd will prove accep|table
for the many curious Informations and Experiments therein contain'd.</P>
<P>What follows is a Collection of &s;everal Lectures concerning the Nature
of <HI>Light,</HI> in which its Cau&s;e, Motion, Action, Velocity and Properties
are largely treated of, with many new, u&s;eful and entertaining Subjects, ei|ther
more copiou&s;ly handled or hinted <HI>in Tran&s;itu.</HI> Tho' the Author has
not in the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es treated of the &s;everal alterations and affections of
the Rays of <HI>Light</HI> from <HI>Reflection, Inflection,</HI> and <HI>Refraction,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB REF="6">
as his intention was to do (which is evident from &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages in his
Writings) yet the Learned will here meet with &s;everal no le&s;&s; difficult than
curious Matters explain'd, among the re&s;t that great Problem of <HI>Memory,</HI>
which is here at lea&s;t intelligibly explicated with the Organs, nece&s;&s;ary to
perform that action of the Mind, or <HI>Reflection,</HI> which Organs po&s;&s;ibly are
not immaterial or incorporeal</P>
<P>From this Contemplation he comes to treat of Time and Duration, &s;hew|ing
whence we gain the Notion of it, which he &s;uppo&s;e&s; from the formation
of, and impre&s;&s;ions upon &s;en&s;ible and coporeal <HI>Ideas,</HI> or Images &s;tored up in
the Repo&s;itory of the Brain, tho' he po&s;itively a&s;&s;erts the recipient and di|recting
Power or <HI>Soul to be a &s;elf-moving immaterial Being.</HI></P>
<P>Next to this is a <HI>Phy&s;ical Treati&s;e of Comets,</HI> proving from many
Ob&s;ervations, that they are actually burning Bodies, with an account of the
unconceivable Velocity of the motion of the Fla&s;hes or Accen&s;ion of the
Steames in the Blaze or Taile far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e of Light'ning: To
this is join'd the Author's <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> of the cau&s;e of <HI>Gravity,</HI> a
Subject that has hitherto puzzl'd, as well as exercis'd the mo&s;t ingenious
Heads. This <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> is deduc'd from Mechanick Principles, and
back'd with Experiments; to which is added a &s;hort Account of his <HI>Hypo|the&s;is
of Magneti&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>After the&s;e are many Lectures concerning the external Shell or <HI>Super|fices
of the Earth,</HI> of the Cau&s;e and Original of Mountains, Vallies and
Lakes. Of Fo&s;&s;ile Shells, and other marine Remains found on the highe&s;t
Hills over mo&s;t part of the known World, with Hi&s;torical Accounts of
<HI>Earthquakes,</HI> fiery Eruptions, Deluges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and a Phy&s;ical Interpreta|tion
of the mo&s;t antient <HI>Mythologick Repre&s;entations of Natural Hi|&s;tory.</HI>
In the&s;e Lectures the figure of the Terraqueous Globe and encom|pa&s;&s;ing
Air is prov'd from the diurnal Motion and Gravitation.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, I have Added &s;ome Lectures relating to the <HI>Improvement of
A&s;tronomy</HI> and <HI>Navigation,</HI> wherein, tho' I cannot promi&s;e the Reader
the Invention of the <HI>Longitude,</HI> or the like great Matters, yet I hope they
will prove agreeable for the &s;everal new and u&s;eful Sugge&s;tions and In&s;tru|ments
therein mention'd and de&s;crib'd, with &s;ome new methods of making
Ob&s;ervations at Land and Sea, to determine the true Meridian La|titude
of the Place, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In all the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es I have fairly and truly given the Author's own
Opinions and Rea&s;onings in his own words, with the &s;everal times when
they were read before the <HI>ROYAL SOCIETY,</HI> when I could any way
di&s;cover them.</P>
<P>I could wi&s;h the Author had him&s;elf fitted the&s;e Papers for the Pre&s;s in
his Life time, or at lea&s;t &s;tich'd the &s;everal agreeing Subjects together,
which would have prevented &s;ome Errors that po&s;&s;ibly have happen'd in the
Order and Di&s;po&s;ition of them, for which I de&s;ire the Reader to accept this
Excu&s;e, that &s;everal of his Papers came to my Sight and Hands, when
others that might better have follow'd them, were Printed off.</P>

<HEAD>THE
LIFE
OF
Dr. Robert Hooke.</HEAD>
<P>UNnder&s;tanding that it would be acceptable to &s;everal Lear|ned
and Ingenious Per&s;ons to have &s;ome publick Account
given of the Life, Studies and Employments of &s;o know|ing
and diligent an Inquirer into Nature, as Dr. <HI>Robert
Hooke</HI> is generally allow'd to have been, and who was one of the
greate&s;t Promoters of Experimental Natural Knowledge, as well
as Ornaments of the la&s;t Century (&s;o fruitful of great <HI>Genii</HI>) I could
not well refu&s;e that Task, which (knowing my own in&s;ufficiency
for &s;uch an Attempt) I could hardly undertake, being con&s;cious it
requir'd a Per&s;on much better qualify'd with natural and acquir'd
Abilities to perform it with Satisfaction; e&s;pecially in &s;o judicious
and nice an Age, more ready to find Faults than pardon Mi&s;takes:
Be&s;ides my de&s;ire has always been not to expo&s;e my &s;elf to Cen&s;ure,
when I might live quietly, <HI>Studiis ignobilis otii.</HI> But the following
Papers of Dr. <HI>Hooke</HI> having been put into my Hands to be Publi&s;h'd,
I was, in &s;ome manner, oblig'd to appear in print. What Mi&s;takes
the Candid Reader may ob&s;erve, in the following Relation of his
Life, I hope he will obligingly pardon. In which I profe&s;s the ut|mo&s;t
Sincerity, the greate&s;t part of my Vouchers being either ta|ken
out his own Memorials, or from the Journals of the Royal So|ciety.</P>
<P>Had Dr. <HI>Hooke</HI> pro&s;ecuted a De&s;ign which I find he once pro|po&s;ed
to him&s;elf, my pre&s;ent Undertaking had been as vain as need|le&s;s,
for in a &s;mall Pocket-Diary of his I found the&s;e Words written.</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>Saturday April</HI> the 10<HI>th</HI> 1697. I began this Day to write the
Hi&s;tory of my own Life, wherein I will comprize as many re|markable
Pa&s;&s;ages, as I can now remember or collect out of &s;uch
Memorials as I have kept in Writing, or are in the Regi&s;ters of
the ROYAL SOCIETY; together with all my Inventions, Ex|periments,
Di&s;coveries, Di&s;cour&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which I have made, the
time when, the manner how, and means by which, with the &s;uc|ce&s;s
and effect of them, together with the &s;tate of my Health,
my Employments and Studies, my good or bad Fortune, my
Friends and Enemies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which &s;hall be the truth of Matter
of Fact, &s;o far as I can be inform'd by my Memorials or my own
Memory, which Rule I re&s;olve not to tran&s;gre&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="8">
Accordingly I found a beginning of his Life, which tho' it af|fords
but little satisfaction, being only concerning his Childhood,
yet I have here given an Ab&s;tract of what is contained in it.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Robert Hooke</HI> was Born at <HI>Fre&s;hwater,</HI> a Penin&s;ula on the We&s;t
&s;ide of the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> on the eighteenth of <HI>July,</HI> being <HI>Saturday,</HI>
1635, at twelve a Clock at Noon, and Chri&s;tened the twenty &s;ixth
following by his own Father Mini&s;ter of that Pari&s;h.</P>
<P>He was very infirm and weakly, and therefore Nur&s;t at Home,
tho' his Brothers and Si&s;ters were Nur&s;t Abroad; and for at lea&s;t
&s;even Years his Parents had very little hopes of his Life, being of|ten
&s;ick; all which time his chief Food was Milk, or things made
thereof, and Fruits, no Fle&s;h in the lea&s;t agreeing with his weak
Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>For his Age he was very &s;prightly and active in Running, Leap|ing,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> tho' very weak as to any robu&s;t Exerci&s;e: Was very apt
to learn any thing, and after his Engli&s;h &s;oon learnt his Grammar
by Heart; but, as he &s;ays, with but little under&s;tanding, till his
Father de&s;igning him for the Mini&s;try, took &s;ome pains to in&s;truct him. But he &s;till being often &s;ubject to the Head-ach which hinder|ed
his Learning, his Father laid a&s;ide all Thoughts of breeding
him a Scholar, and finding him&s;elf al&s;o grow very infirm through
Age and Sickne&s;s, wholly neglected his farther Education, who be|ing
thus left to him&s;elf &s;pent his time in making little mechanical
&startq;Toys, (as he &s;ays) in which he was very intent, and for the Tools
he had &s;ucce&s;sful; &s;o that there was nothing he &s;aw done by any
Mechanick, but he endeavoured to imitate, and in &s;ome parti|culars
could exceed (which are his own words.&endq;) His Father ob|&s;erving
by the&s;e Indications, his great inclination to Mechanicks,
thought to put him Apprentice to &s;ome ea&s;y Trade (as a Watch|makers
or Limners) he &s;hewing mo&s;t inclinations to tho&s;e or the
like curious Mechanical Performances; for making u&s;e of &s;uch
Tools as he could procure, &startq;&s;eeing an old Bra&s;s Clock taken to pieces,
he attemted to imitate it, and made a wooden one that would go:
Much about the &s;ame time he made a &s;mall Ship about a Yard
long, fitly &s;haping it, adding its Rigging of Ropes, Pullies, Ma&s;ts,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> with a contrivance to make it fire off &s;ome &s;mall Guns, as it
was Sailing cro&s;s a Haven of a pretty breadth: He had al&s;o a
great fancy for drawing, having much about the &s;ame Age Cop|pied
&s;everal Prints with a Pen, that Mr. <HI>Hoskins</HI> (Son to the fa|mous
<HI>Hoskins Cowpers</HI> Ma&s;ter) much admired one not in&s;tructed
could &s;o well imitate them.&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e Indications of a Mechanick Genius appeared in him when
very young; for by the &s;ame Paper I find that his Father died in
<HI>October</HI> 1648, having for three or four Years before his Death been
much afflicted with a Cough, a Pal&s;y, Jaundice and Drop&s;y.</P>
<P>This is the &s;um of what he has left of his own Writing, by which
we find him at the time of his Fathers Death, to be thirteen Years
and about three Months Old.</P>
<P>This early Propen&s;ity of his to Mechanicks was a &s;ign of his fu|ture
Excellency in &s;uch Contrivances, and admirable Facility he
afterwards manife&s;ted in applying Mechanical Principles to the ex|plication
of the mo&s;t difficult <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature, and I remem|ber
it has been often ob&s;erved by &s;everal Per&s;ons, that whatever <HI>ap|paratus</HI>
he contrived for the exhibiting any Experiment before the
<PB N="iii" REF="9">
ROYAL SOCIETY, it was performed with the lea&s;t Embarra&s;&s;|ment
clearly and evidently, to explain the pre&s;ent Subject, which
was a &s;ufficient proof of his true knowledge of the Mechanical
Powers, and of a method of applying them to the Explication of Nature.</P>
<P>How he &s;pent the next &s;ix or &s;even Years of his Life I have
not been particularly informed; but I under&s;tand he was for &s;ome time
with Sir <HI>Peter Lely,</HI> how long I am not certain: I &s;uppo&s;e but a
&s;hort time; for I have heard that the &s;mell of the Oil Colours did not
agree with his Con&s;titution, increa&s;ing his Head-ach, to which he
was ever too much &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It was after this that he lived with Dr. <HI>Busby,</HI> the late famous
Ma&s;ter of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-School,</HI> as a Scholar in his own Hou&s;e, where
with more diligence he apply'd him&s;elf to <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> in which
he made a &s;ufficient proficiency for the time, and had a competent
Knowledge, and at the &s;ame time got &s;ome in&s;ight into the <HI>Hebrew</HI>
and &s;ome other Oriental Languages. While he liv'd with Dr. <HI>Bu&s;|by</HI>
he fell &s;eriou&s;ly upon the &s;tudy of the Mathematicks, the Dr.
encouraging him therein, and allowing him particular times for
that purpo&s;e. In this he took the mo&s;t regular Method, and fir&s;t
made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>Euclide</HI>'s Elements, and thence proceeded
orderly from that &s;ure Ba&s;is to the other parts of the Mathematicks,
and after to the application thereof to Mechanicks, his fir&s;t and la&s;t
Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>From <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-School</HI> he went to the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> in
1653. but as 'tis often the Fate of Per&s;ons great in Learning to
be &s;mall in other Circum&s;tances, his were but mean. I find that he
was a Student of <HI>Chri&s;t-Church,</HI> tho' not of the Foundation, but
was, as I have heard, a Servitor to one Mr. <HI>Goodman,</HI> and took his
Degree of <HI>Master of Arts</HI> &s;everal Years after, about 1662, or 1663.</P>
<P>About the Year 1655, he began to &s;hew him&s;elf to the World,
and that he had not &s;pent his Juvenile Years in vain; for there be|ing
a Concour&s;e at that time of extraordinary Per&s;ons at <HI>Oxford,</HI>
each of which afterwards were particularly di&s;tingui&s;h'd for the
great Light they gave the Learned World by their ju&s;tly admired
Labours; he was &s;oon taken notice of, and for his Facility in Me|chanick
Inventions much priz'd by them.</P>
<P>For the proof of his being at this time brought into the acquain|tance
of the&s;e great Men, I &s;hall tran&s;cribe &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages which I
met with among his Manu&s;cripts; and fir&s;t &s;peaking of their Phi|lo&s;ophical
Meetings at <HI>Oxford,</HI> he &s;ays,</P>
<P>&startq;At the&s;e Meetings, which were about the Year 1655 (before
which time I knew little of them) divers Experiments were &s;ug|ge&s;ted,
di&s;cours'd and try'd with various &s;ucce&s;&s;es, tho' no other
account was taken of them but what particular Per&s;ons perhaps
did for the help of their own Memories; &s;o that many excellent
things have been lo&s;t, &s;ome few only by the kindne&s;s of the Au|thors
have been &s;ince made publick; among the&s;e may be reckon'd
the Honourable Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI>'s <HI>Pneumatick Engine</HI> and Experiments,
fir&s;t Printed in the Year 1660. for in 1658, or 9, I contriv'd and
perfected the Air-pump for Mr <HI>Boyle,</HI> having fir&s;t &s;een a Contri|vance
for that purpo&s;e made for the &s;ame honourable Per&s;on by
Mr. <HI>Gratorix,</HI> which was too gro&s;s to perform any great matter.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="10">
The Draught of this Air-pump and all its parts, as it was after
Publi&s;h'd by Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> I have now by me de&s;ign'd by Mr. <HI>Hooke,</HI>
and I have heard him &s;ay, he was then &s;ent to <HI>London</HI> by Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI>
to get the Barrel and other parts for that Engine which could not
be made at <HI>Oxford.</HI> But to return to &s;ome other Notes.</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;ame Year I contriv'd and made many trials about the Art
of flying in the Air, and moving very &s;wift on the Land and Wa|ter', of which I &s;hew'd &s;everal De&s;igns to Dr. <HI>Wilkins</HI> then <HI>War|den</HI>
of <HI>Wadham College,</HI> and at the &s;ame time made a Module,
which, by the help of Springs and Wings, rais'd and &s;u&s;tain'd it
&s;elf in the Air; but finding by my own trials, and afterwards by
Calculation, that the Mu&s;cles of a Mans Body were not &s;uffici|ent
to do any thing con&s;iderable of that kind, I apply'd my Mind
to contrive a way to make artificial Mu&s;cles; divers de&s;igns where|of
I &s;hew'd al&s;o at the &s;ame time to Dr. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> but was in ma|ny
of my Trials fru&s;trated of my expectations.&endq;</P>
<P>What is mention'd here of his attempts about flying, is con|firm'd
by &s;everal Draughts and Schemes upon Paper, of the Me|thods
that might be attempted for that purpo&s;e, and of &s;ome con|trivances
for fa&s;tening &s;uccedaneous Wings, not unlike tho&s;e of
Bats, to the Arms and Legs of a Man, as likewi&s;e of a Contri|vance
to rai&s;e him up by means of Horizontal Vanes plac'd a little
a&s;lope to the Wind, which being blown round, turn'd an endle&s;s
Screw in the Center, which help'd to move the Wings, to be ma|nag'd
by the Per&s;on by this means rais'd aloft: The&s;e Schemes I
have now by me, with &s;ome few Fragments relating thereto, but
&s;o imperfect, that I do not judge them fit for the Publick. But to
return to his own Notes.</P>
<P>&startq;About this time having an opportunity of acquainting my &s;elf
with A&s;tronomy by the kindne&s;s of Dr. <HI>Ward,</HI> I apply'd my &s;elf
to the improving of the <HI>Pendulum</HI> for &s;uch Ob&s;ervations, and in the
Year 1656, or 57, I contriv'd a way to continue the motion of
the <HI>Pendulum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tom. 1. Lib. 2. Cap. 20. &amp; 21.</NOTE> &s;o much commended by <HI>Ricciolus</HI> in his <HI>Almage&s;tum,</HI>
which Dr. <HI>W$ard</HI> had recommended to me to peru&s;e; I made &s;ome
trials for this end, which I found to &s;ucced to my wi&s;h.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e made me farther think of improving it for
finding the Longitude, and<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="marg">I never could meet with what is menti|oned here, and in &s;everal o|ther places of his Tracts al|ready Printed, and of tho&s;e contained in this Volume, <HI>of a method for Mechanick Inventions,</HI> which he &s;omewhere calls a <HI>Mechanick Algebra</HI> for &s;olving any Probleme in Mechanicks, as ea&s;ily and cer|tainly as any Geometrickhly <HI>Algebra,</HI> and &s;ays, that by this his method he could readily determine whether any &s;uc$ Probleme was po&s;&s;ible, and if &s;o, which was the neare&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t way of &s;olving it.</NOTE> <HI>the Method I had made for my &s;elf for
Mechanick Inventions,</HI> quickly led me to the u&s;e of Springs in&s;tead
of Gravity for the making a Body vibrate in any Po&s;ture, where|upon
I did fir&s;t in great, and afterwards in &s;maller Modules, &s;ati&s;|fy
my &s;elf of the Practicablene&s;s of &s;uch an Invention, and hop|ing
to have made great advantage thereby, I acquainted divers
of my Friends, and particularly Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> that I was po&s;&s;e&s;t of
&s;uch an Invention, and crav'd their A&s;&s;i&s;tance for improving the
u&s;e of it to my advantage.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Immediately after his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Re&s;toration, Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> was plea|&s;ed
to acquaint the Lord <HI>Brouncher</HI> and Sir <HI>Robert Moray</HI> with it,
who advis'd me to get a Patent for the Invention, and propoun|ded
very probable ways of making con&s;iderable advantage by it.
To induce them to a belief of my performance, I &s;hew'd a Pocket-watch,
<PB N="v" REF="11">
accommodated with a Spring, apply'd to the Arbor of
the Ballance to regulate the motion thereof; concealing the way
I had for finding the Longitude; this was &s;o well approv'd of,
that Sir <HI>Robert Moray</HI> drew me up the form of a Patent, the prin|cipal
part whereof, <HI>viz.</HI> the de&s;cription of the Watch, &s;o regulat|ed,
is his own hand Writing, which I have yet by me, the di&s;|couragement
I met with in the management of this Affair, made
me de&s;i&s;t for that time.&endq;</P>
<P>So far this Paper. In confirmation of what is above&s;aid, I met with
a Draught of an Agreement between the Lord <HI>Brouncher,</HI> Mr.
<HI>Boyle,</HI> and Sir <HI>Robert Moray,</HI> with <HI>Robert Hooke</HI> Ma&s;ter of Arts to
this purpo&s;e, that <HI>Robert Hooke</HI> &s;hould di&s;cover to them the whole
of his Invention to mea&s;ure the parts of Time at Sea as exactly and
truly as they are at Land by the <HI>Pendulum</HI> Clocks invented by Mon|&s;ieur
<HI>Huygens;</HI> That of the Profits to be made thereby not exceed|ing
6000 <HI>l. Robert Hooke</HI> was to have &frac34; of whatever was made more
of it, not exceeding 4000 <HI>l. Robert Hooke</HI> was to have &frac23; of the re&s;t,
if more could be made of it, he was to have the &frac12;, and <HI>Robert Hooke</HI>
to be publickly owned the Author and Inventor thereof. This is
the &s;um of one Draught; there are indeed &s;ome others which differ
only in the divi&s;ion of the Profits, which it is needle&s;s here to trou|ble
the Reader with. In pur&s;uance of this De&s;ign there were &s;e|veral
Papers drawn up, <HI>viz.</HI> The Draught of an Act of Parliament to
oblige all Ma&s;ters of Ships to pay &s;o much <HI>per</HI> Tun for the u&s;e of
this Invention, as al&s;o of a Warrant to be granted by the <HI>King</HI> to
<HI>Robert Hooke, M. A.</HI> &amp;c. for a Patent for the &s;ole u&s;e of the &s;aid In|vention

<P>Thus far the Matter then proceeded, and how it came to &s;top
here may be ju&s;tly wondred; but to give the Reader the be&s;t &s;ati&s;|faction
I can in this matter, I &s;hall tran&s;cribe a Paragraph out of
the Po&s;tcript to <HI>Hooke</HI>'s Treati&s;e of <HI>Helio&s;copes</HI> Printed 1676.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 27.</NOTE></P>
<P>&startq;This Treaty with me had been finally concluded for &s;everal
Thou&s;and Pounds, had not the in&s;erting of one Clau&s;e broke it
off, which was, <HI>That if after I had di&s;cover'd my Invention about
the finding the Longitude by Watches (tho' in them&s;elves &s;ufficient) they,
or any other Per&s;on &s;hould find a way of improving my Principles he or
they &s;hould have the benefit thereof during the term of the Patent, and
not I.</HI> To which Clau&s;e I could no ways agree, knowing 'twas
ea&s;y to vary my Principles an hundred ways; and 'twas not im|probable,
but there might be &s;ome addition of conveniency to
what I &s;hould at fir&s;t di&s;cover, it being <HI>facile inventis addere;</HI> and
judging it unrea&s;onable to be depriv'd of the benefit of my In|ventions,
in them&s;elves &s;ufficient, becau&s;e others might vary
them, or any other ways improve them, of which it was very
probable they would have no thought if they had not the advan|tage
of being in&s;tructed by my Di&s;covery, it having been hid
&s;ome Thou&s;ands of Years already; as indeed the effect hath made
evident and certain, there having been nothing done by any Bo|dy
el&s;e upon that matter ever &s;ince.&endq;</P>
<P>There is more in the &s;ame place worth the peru&s;al, which, for
brevity, I omit.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="12">
Dr. <HI>Hooke</HI> &s;uffering this Invention to lie undi&s;cover'd to the la&s;t,
gave &s;ome Per&s;ons cau&s;e to que&s;tion whether he was ever Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of
it, and to doubt whether what in Theory &s;eem'd very promi&s;ing,
wou'd an&s;wer when put to the Te&s;t of Practice; others indeed
more &s;everely judged, that it was only a kind of boa&s;ting in him,
to a&s;&s;ert he knew that which had not yet been perform'd, tho' at|tempted
by many. However the matter is, it is certain he per|&s;i&s;ted
in the affirmation to the la&s;t, and not many Weeks before
his Death, told me and other Per&s;ons, that he knew a certain and
infallible method to de&s;cover the true place of a Ve&s;&s;el at Sea, as to
its Ea&s;t and We&s;t di&s;tance from the Port departed from: Whether
by Watches, or other Time-keepers, or by any other ways, I know
not, tho' indeed by what is before mention'd, it &s;hould &s;eem to be
by Watches, for the improvement of which he made many Trials,
and read &s;everal Di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>However this matter produc'd the di&s;covery of that mo&s;t u&s;eful
and practicable method of regulating Pocket-watches by a &s;piral
Spring, apply'd to the Arbor of the Ballance as they are now made
without any con&s;iderable addition &s;ince; the Hi&s;tory of which, as
I have heard it from him&s;elf and find publi&s;h'd, is thus.</P>
<P>In Di&s;cour&s;e once he told me, that about the Year 1660. he ha|ving
&s;hewn a Movement &s;o regulated to the Lord <HI>Brouncher,</HI> &amp;c.
as is above related, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Huygens</HI> having for &s;ome time apply'd
him&s;elf to invent &s;everal ways to regulate Time-keepers by the cor|re&s;pondence
he held with Mr. <HI>Oldenburgh,</HI> among other matters had
notice of this, for which there was afterwards an application made
to procure a Patent. This indeed is po&s;&s;ible, but whether it were
&s;o or not I cannot determine. That Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> had many Years be|fore
(<HI>Huygens</HI> mention'd it) di&s;cover'd the Invention is certain, by
what is related in the Hi&s;tory of the ROYAL SOCIETY among &s;e|veral
new Inventions, in the&s;e words, <HI>There have been invented &s;everal kinds of Pendulum Watches for the Pocket,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pag. 247.</NOTE> <HI>wherein the motion is regulat|ed
by Springs,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now tho' this does not mention the Springs being &s;piral or fa|&s;tened
to the Arbor of the Ballance, yet it appears it was &s;o by
what is related above, and a Pa&s;&s;age I have &s;een in a Leter from Sir
<HI>Robert Moray</HI> to Mr. <HI>Oldenburgh,</HI> dated <HI>Oxon Sept.</HI> 30. 1665. clears it,
in which are the&s;e words. &startq;You (meaning <HI>Oldenburg</HI>) will be
the fir&s;t that knows when his (that is <HI>Hugyens</HI>'s) Watches will be
ready, and I will therefore expect from you an account of them,
and if he imparts to you what he does, let me know it; to that
purpo&s;e you may ask him if he doth not <HI>apply a Spring to the Arbor
of the Ballance,</HI> and that will give him occa&s;ion to &s;ay &s;omewhat
to you; if it be that, you may tell him what <HI>Hooke has done in
that matter, and what he intends more.</HI>&endq; Altho' I cannot be assur'd
what <HI>Oldenburgh</HI> wrote to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Huygens,</HI> yet it is probable their
intimacy procur'd what he knew; and it is evident that <HI>Huygens</HI>'s
di&s;covery of this was fir&s;t publi&s;h'd in the <HI>Journal des Scavans,</HI> and
from thence in the Philo&s;. Tran&s;act. for <HI>March</HI> 25th. 1675, about
ten Years after that Letter of Sir <HI>Robert Morays,</HI> and near fifteen af|ter
<HI>Hooke</HI>'s fir&s;t discovery of it.</P>
<P>To this I &s;hall add what Mr. <HI>Oldenburgh</HI> has Printed, <HI>Philo&s;-Tran&s;act.</HI>
N^o. 118. &startq;'Tis certain the de&s;criber of Helio&s;copes (mean|ing
<HI>Hooke</HI>) &s;ome Years ago caus'd to be actually made &s;ome
<PB N="vii" REF="13">
Watches of this kind;&endq; which (indeed he there &s;ays) were un&s;ucce&s;s|ful.
Which whether &s;o or not, I cannot learn, &s;o many Years after,
tho' I am inclin'd to think that Expre&s;&s;ion proceeded from Pa&s;&s;ion&punc;
the Invention and Principle of <HI>Hooke</HI>'s and <HI>Huygens</HI>'s being both
the very &s;ame as are now us'd.</P>
<P>To this of Mr. <HI>Oldenburgh,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> made his Reply in a Po&s;t|&s;cript
to his <HI>Lampas:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philo&s;. Tran&s;. N^o. 129. p. 749.</NOTE> In rejoinder to which <HI>Oldenburg</HI> Printed a
Declaration of the Council of the ROYAL SOCIETY, to te&s;tify
his faithfulne&s;s in managing the Corre&s;pondence of the Society;
but it is ob&s;ervable that in this place there is no contradiction to
<HI>Hooke</HI>'s being the fir&s;t in that Invention.</P>
<P>It cannot be deny'd but that Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> was frequently de&s;ir'd to
perfect his Inventions about Watches and Time-keepers, which,
when urg'd, he as often promis'd, and when any new Contrivance
was by any Per&s;on produc'd, he then &s;hew'd &s;omething of his own,
either the &s;ame, or excelling it, a Proof he had try'd the &s;ame
before. &startq;Particularly when on the 9<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1666. Mr. <HI>Mer|cator</HI>
&s;hew'd to the Society a Watch of his Invention, represent|ing
the Aequation of Time to the approbation of the Company.
Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> at the &s;ame time produc'd a new piece of Watch-work
of his own Contrivance to mea&s;ure Time exactly both at
Sea and Land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Journal $word$</NOTE> of which he was de&s;ir'd to bring in the De&s;crip|tion,
which, tho' promis'd, was, as I think, never done.&endq;</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd that very many of his Inventions were ne|ver
brought to the perfection they were capable of, nor put in
practice till &s;ome other Per&s;on either Foreigner or of our own Na|tion
cultivated the Invention, which, when <HI>Hooke</HI> found, it put
him upon the fini&s;hing that which otherwi&s;e po&s;&s;ibly might have
lain 'till this time in its fir&s;t Defects: Whether this mi&s;take aro&s;e
from the multiplicity of his Bu&s;ine&s;s which did not allow him a &s;uf|ficient
time, or from the fertility of his Invention which hurry'd
him on, in the que&s;t of new Entertainments, neglecting the former
Di&s;coveries when he was once &s;ati&s;fied of the feazablene&s;s and cer|tainty
of them, tho' there wanted &s;ome &s;mall matter to render
their u&s;e more practicable and general, I know not, and whether
this was the Ca&s;e in the pre&s;ent Subject: But this I &s;uppo&s;e
may be an undoubted Truth, the &s;piral Springs were not ap|ply'd
generally to regulate Watches, 'till after this Dispute with
<HI>Huygens.</HI></P>
<P>I have been the more particular in this matter, that I Might, as
far as I was able, a&s;&s;ert the Invention to the true Author, and &s;up|po&s;e
I have wrong'd no Per&s;on. They that require more of this
Subject may con&s;ult the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, and <HI>Hooke</HI>'s
Tracts in the places before quoted: I have in this brought all that
relates to this Que&s;tion together, that the Reader may the better
under&s;tand the whole matter, tho' thereby I have di&s;order'd the
&s;eries of his Life, and order of Time.</P>
<P>But to return (from this Digre&s;&s;ion, which, to make it more plain,
I have enlarg'd upon) to <HI>Oxford,</HI> I find that 1655, or 6 there were
many curious Experiments, Ob&s;ervations and Inquiries made, and
In&s;truments for tho&s;e purpo&s;es contriv'd, as particularly the <HI>Barome|ter,</HI>
of which he &s;ays, the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of the Invention was a Sug|ge&s;tion
of Sir <HI>Ch. Wren</HI> in order to find whether the Hypothe&s;is of
<HI>Des Cartes</HI> for giving Rea&s;on of the Tides from the pre&s;&s;ure of
<PB N="viii" REF="14">
the Moon upon the Air in its pa&s;&s;age by the Meridian, were true or not.
At this time I have heard Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> &s;ay, it was fir&s;t ob&s;erv'd,
that the height of the <HI>Mercury</HI> in the <HI>Barometer</HI> did not conform it&s;elf
to the Moon's motion, but to that of the different Gravitation of
the Air, as has been $ince &s;ufficiently verified. Yet in a <HI>French</HI>
Treati&s;e Printed at <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;everal Years after this Ob&s;ervation at
<HI>Oxford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Traitez de l'Equilibre de|liqu&euml;urs,</HI> &amp;c. 1664.</NOTE> the di&s;covery of the Gravitation of the Air is attributed to
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pa&s;cal</HI> deduced from &s;everal Experiments, made about
the Year 1650. at <HI>Clermont</HI> in <HI>Auvergne</HI> by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Perier,</HI> at <HI>Paris</HI>
by others: And at <HI>Stockholm</HI> by Me&s;&s;eures <HI>Des Cartes</HI> and <HI>Chanute;</HI>
which if it be, as is there related, and the Inferences from that Ex|periment
&s;uch as are in the &s;ame Tract mentioned, 'tis &s;trange they
&s;hould not have been apply'd to the u&s;e of &s;o beneficial an In&s;tru|ment
&s;ooner, which I do not find it was till after this Ob&s;ervation
at <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>By the per&s;ua&s;ion of Dr. <HI>Seth Ward,</HI> afterwards Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salisbu|ry,</HI>
about 1656, he apply'd him&s;elf more particularly to the Study
of A&s;tronomy, and about 58, or 59, he &s;ays thus, &startq;I contriv'd &s;e|veral
A&s;tronomical In&s;truments for making Ob&s;ervations both at
Sea and Land, which I afterwards produc'd before the ROYAL
SOCIETY.&endq;</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, are the In&s;truments hereafter menti|on'd
in his A&s;tronomical Lectures, where I have endeavour'd to re|trieve
as many as I could,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide p.</HI> 500. &amp;c. <HI>infra.</HI></NOTE>
partly from &s;ome rough Draughts,
partly from old Modules, and &s;ome from the verbal De&s;criptions
where both tho&s;e helps were wanting; in which how I have &s;uc|ceeded,
is left to the candid Readers Judgment.</P>
<P>&startq;Much about this time (as he &s;ays) he contriv'd the <HI>Circular Pen|dulum,</HI>&endq;
and the u&s;e of it for continuing the motion of another <HI>Pen|dulum,</HI>
which he afterwards &s;hew'd to the ROYAL SOCIETY
in 1663; about which time, and afterwards, there are &s;everal par|ticulars
relating to the <HI>Circular Pendulum</HI> enter'd in the Journals as
his: A Movement to this purpo&s;e; is de&s;crib'd in his <HI>Animadver&s;ions</HI>
on <HI>Machina Caele&s;tis,</HI> pag. 68. Printed 1674.</P>
<P>In the Year 1660. the mo&s;t Illu&s;trious ROYAL SOCIETY was
founded, for a full account of which, and its In&s;titution, the Rea|der
is referred to the Right Reverend and Learned, Dr. <HI>Sprat</HI>'s Hi|&s;tory
thereof, Publi&s;h'd 1667. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve the Occa&s;ion
and Time when Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> was introduc'd into their Service as <HI>Cu|rator.</HI>
Soon after the beginning of the ROYAL SOCIETY, <HI>viz.</HI>
about <HI>April</HI> 1661. a Debate aro&s;e in the Society, occa&s;ion'd by a
&s;mall Tract Printed in 1660. about the cau&s;e of the ri&s;ing of Water
in &s;lender Gla&s;s Pipes, higher than in larger, and that in a certain
proportion to their Bores; this Di&s;cour&s;e was wrote and Publi&s;h'd
by <HI>Hooke;</HI> the Explication of which diffcult <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> made him
the more regarded. The &s;um of his Rea&s;onings upon this Subject
he Publi&s;h'd afterward, <HI>Micrography Ob&s;erv.</HI> the 6th. in which there
are &s;everal very curious and then new Remarks and Hints; as to
the Nature of Fluidity and Gravity, which la&s;t is farther pro&s;ecut|ed
in his Treati&s;e of Springs, with other excellent Subjects, to which
the Inqui&s;itive are referr'd for a more ample &s;ati&s;faction.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="15">
This, together with his former Performances, made him much
re&s;pected by the <HI>R. Society,</HI> and on the fifth of <HI>November 1662. &startq;</HI> Sir
<HI>Robert Moray</HI> propos'd a Per&s;on that was willing to be entertain'd
as a <HI>Curator</HI> by the <HI>Society,</HI> offering to furni&s;h them every day
when they met, with three or four con&s;iderable Experiments;
which Propo&s;ition was unanimou&s;ly receiv'd, Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> being
nam'd to be the Per&s;on; and accordingly the next Day of their
meeting on the twelfth of <HI>November</HI> he was unanimou&s;ly accep|ted
and taken as <HI>Curator,</HI> with the Thanks of the <HI>Society</HI> order'd
to Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> for di&s;pen&s;ing with him for their u&s;e, and order'd
that Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> &s;hould come and &s;it among them, and both bring
in every Day three or four of his own Experiments, and take care
of &s;uch others as &s;hould be recommended to him by the <HI>So|ciety.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>From this time the <HI>Societies</HI> Journals gave &s;ufficient Te&s;timoni|als
of his Performances, all which would be too many to particu|larize
here, therefore I &s;hall only touch upon &s;ome of the chief, as
the Experiment of breaking Gla&s;s-Bubbles inward, the Air con|tain'd
in them being rarify'd by heat in their blowing, and &s;o her|metically
&s;ealing them whil&s;t hot; which Bubbles were ob&s;erv'd at
a certain degree of Ten&s;ion, both in the di&s;tending them whil&s;t
blowing, and in their contracting as they cool'd, to yield a &s;mart
&s;ound, &s;everal of the&s;e in cooling would break inwards with a
brisk noi&s;e, tho' others broak without any noi&s;e, upon which the
Experimenter made &s;everal Remarks.</P>
<P>Many Experiments were made to explicate the Nature and Qua|lity
of the Air, <HI>viz.</HI> as to its Gravitation, its different Effects when
Rarify'd, Condens'd and Natural, with its u&s;e as to the Life of A|nimals,
and maintaining a lucid Flame, or cau&s;e the Di&s;&s;olution of
Bodies by Fire, a live Animal and Lamp being inclo&s;ed together in
a Receiver, &s;hew'd the <HI>Pabulum vitae</HI> and <HI>&s;lammae</HI> to be much the &s;ame:
At which time al&s;o he try'd how long the &s;ame Air would &s;erve
for breathing. This leads me to remember that noble Experiment
made by him of keeping a Dog alive, his <HI>Thorax</HI> being laid open,
by blowing fre&s;h Air into his Lungs, of which a particular Account
is given in the Hi&s;tory of the ROYAL SOCIETY, pag. 232. which plainly
&s;hews the u&s;e of the Air, and difference between ve|nal
and arterial Blood.</P>
<P>He &s;hew'd what addition of weight is given to Fluids, by a|&s;cending
and de&s;cending Bodies in them. The different Specifick
weight of Hot and Cold Water, with the u&s;es to be made thereof
in heating large quantities of Water. Of the difference of Ice and
Water, with the Refraction of other Fluids, by an In&s;trument de|&s;crib'd
in the Preface to his Micrography.</P>
<P>Experiments and a Contrivance to &s;hew the Force and Velocity
of Bodies falling from &s;everal heights, weighing Bodies at &s;everal
heights. <HI>Pendulums</HI> of two hundred Foot long. The difference of
the <HI>Barometer</HI> at &s;everal heights. Experiments to improve Land
Carriage. Methods of conveying &s;ecret and quick Intelligence.</P>
<P>In&s;truments to mea&s;ure time exactly. To ob&s;erve a &s;econd Mi|nute
by the Sun or Stars. To try the &s;trength of Gun-power, and
&s;everal others, particularly an Engine to cut down the Teeth of
Watch Wheels more exactly than can be done by the mo&s;t expert
Hand, an Invention now of con&s;tant use.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="16">
About this time he fix'd the Standard for the <HI>Thermometer</HI> from the
Point of Freezing; and contriv'd a way to make the motions of the
<HI>Barometer</HI> more &s;en&s;ible, which is &s;ince with farther Improvements,
Publi&s;h'd in the <HI>Philo&s;oph. Tran&s;act.</HI> N^o. 185. p. 241.</P>
<P>In <HI>Feb.</HI> 1663-64. he contriv'd a way to &s;upply fre&s;h Air to the U|rinator
under the Diving Bell by a Chain of Buckets and a Leaden
Box for his Head, when he went out of the Bell to be &s;upply'd with
fre&s;h Air from the Bell, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>At this time he &s;hew'd Experiments of the dilating of Gla&s;s and
other Bodies by Heat.</P>
<P>In <HI>July</HI> 1664. he produc'd an Experement to &s;hew the number of
Vibrations of an extended String, made in a determinate time, re|qui&s;ite
to give a certain Tone or Note, by which it was found that
a Wire making two hundred &s;eventy two vibrations in one Second
of Time, &s;ounded <HI>G Sol Re Vt</HI> in the Scale of all Mu&s;ick. Other

<P>At &s;everal Meetings of the <HI>Society</HI> in 1663, and 4. he produc'd his

made upon them, which were after publi&s;h'd in his <HI>Micrographia,</HI>
at the beginning of the Year 1665. In which Book, I &s;uppo&s;e, it
will hardly be deny'd, that there are more excellent Philo&s;ophical
Di&s;coveries and Hints, that in mo&s;t extant of its bulk: The Book
it&s;elf being well known, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve that there are de&s;crib'd in it
&s;everal &s;orts of Micro&s;copes, with the ways of u&s;ing them.
The Baro&s;cope, Hygro&s;cope, an In&s;trument to graduate Thermo|meters,

the Refraction of Liquors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I remember Mr. <HI>Mar&s;hal</HI> when he
de&s;ir'd the <HI>Societies</HI> Approbation of his new Method of grinding

Lecture, with a Yearly Gratuity of fifty Pounds, on the twenty
&s;econd of the &s;ame Month &s;everal Members met to confer about
the manner of &s;etling that Lecture, and on the ninth of <HI>Novem|ber</HI>

<HI>John Cutler</HI> having founded a Lecture, and &s;ettl'd an Annual Sti|pend

the Pre&s;ident, Council and Fellows of the &s;aid <HI>Society</HI> to
direct and appoint the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> as to the Subject and Number
of his Lectures) the <HI>Society</HI> order'd &s;everal of their Members to
wait upon Sir <HI>John Cutler,</HI> with their Thanks for his particular
Favour to a worthy Member, and for that Re&s;pect and Confidence
he hath hereby expre&s;t towards their whole Body, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;On the twenty &s;eventh of <HI>June</HI> 1664. it was voted that at the
fir&s;t Opportunity Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> &s;hould be put to the Scrutiny for
the <HI>Curators</HI> place by Office; on the twenty third of <HI>November</HI>
following he was propos'd as a <HI>Setled Curator</HI> of Experiments;
and on the eleventh of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1664. elected and made <HI>Curator by Of|fice</HI>
for Life, with an additional Salary to Sir <HI>John Cutler</HI>'s Annu|ity.&endq;</P>
<P>At this time he read &s;everal A&s;tronomical Lectures, &s;ome of
which are publi&s;h'd in this Volume, and invented many In&s;tru|ments,
particularly his Quadrant with a Roler on the Limb; an
In&s;trument to mea&s;ure the Velocity of the Wind, and repeated
the Experiment of the Vibrations of a Pendule two hundred
Foot long. The fir&s;t propo&s;al for the Weather-Clock was then of|fer'd
upon the De&s;cription of one made by Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Wren.</HI>
The Experiment was made and account given of the &s;u&s;pension of
the Mercury to &s;eventy five Inches in the Tube, which, with &s;ome
additions, is Printed in this Volume. From this time he brought
in almo&s;t at every Meeting Experiments, Ob&s;ervations, Schemes of new In&s;truments and Inventions, or &s;omething con&s;iderable to
the advancement of Knowledge, and very frequently read his <HI>Cut|lerian</HI>
Lectures, of many whereof he publi&s;h'd, the mo&s;t material
parts in his Tracts Printed at different times, in Quarto, call'd
<HI>Lectures and Collections,</HI> &amp;c. comprizing compendiou&s;ly in one con|tinu'd
Di&s;cour&s;e, the chief Matters and Subjects handled in &s;everal Lectures.</P>
<P>Thus the generous Ardor with which the ROYAL SOCIETY
was in&s;pir'd, continu'd 'till the Year 1665. when, by rea&s;on of the
great Mortaity then reigning, they were oblig'd to de&s;i&s;t and break
up their Weekly Meetings till the fourteenth of <HI>March</HI> 1665-66. when, upon
Summons, they met again. In this Interim the Members retir'd to &s;everal Places in the Country, and Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> attend|ed
Dr. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> and &s;ome other ingenious Gentlemen into <HI>Sur|ry,</HI>
near <HI>Ban&s;tead Downs,</HI> where &s;everal Experiments were made
during this Rece&s;s, an account of which was after brought into
the <HI>Society.</HI></P>
<P>At &s;ome of the fir&s;t Meetings, after they came together again,
&startq;Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> produc'd a very &s;mall Quadrant for ob&s;erving accu|rately
to Minutes and Seconds, it had an Arm moving on it by
means of a Screw lying on the Limb of the Quadrant;&endq; this is
all the account I find of it. Po&s;&s;ibly this was the fir&s;t ever made
after that manner, tho' it is now &s;ufficiently known and practis'd:
A large one of this &s;ort, and of all its parts, with the re&s;t of the
<HI>apparatus</HI> and manner of u&s;ing it, is at large publi&s;h'd by the In|ventor,
<HI>Anno</HI> 1674. in his Animadver&s;ions on <HI>Hevelius</HI>'s <HI>Machina
Caele&s;tis,</HI> pag. 54. in which Book al&s;o &s;everal other ingenious Con|trivances,
In&s;truments and Inventions are mention'd.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="18">
&startq;<HI>May</HI> 23d. 1666.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Journal R. S.</NOTE> There was read a Paper of Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI>'s ex|plicating
the Inflexion of a direct motion into a Curve, by a &s;u|pervening,
attractive Principle, which was order'd to be Regi|&s;ter'd.
The Di&s;cour&s;e contain'd therein is an Introduction to an
Experiment to &s;hew that Circular Motion, is compounded of an
indeavour by a direct motion by the Tangent, and of another in|deavour
tending to the Center: To which purpo&s;e there was a
<HI>Pendulum</HI> fa&s;tended to the Roof of the Room with a large wooden
Ball of <HI>Lignum Vitae</HI> on the end of it; and it was found, that if
the <HI>Impetus</HI> of the indeavour by the Tangent, at the fir&s;t &s;etting
out, was &s;tronger than the indeavour to the Center, there was
generated &s;uch an Elliptical Motion, who&s;e longe&s;t Diameter was
parallel to the direct indeavour of the Body at the fir&s;t Impul&s;e:
But if that <HI>Impetus</HI> were weaker than that indeavour to the Cen|ter,
there was generated &s;uch an Elliptical Motion, who&s;e &s;hor|ter
Diameter was parallel to the direct indeavour of the Body in
the fir&s;t point of the Impul&s;e; if both were equal there was made
a perfect Circular Motion. There was al&s;o made another Expe|riment,
by fa&s;tening another Pendulous Body by a &s;hort String
on the lower part of the Wire, by which the greater weight was
&s;u&s;pended, that it might freely make a Circular or Elliptical Mo|tion
round the bigger, whil&s;t the bigger mov'd Circularly of El|liptically
about the fir&s;t Center. The intention whereof was to
explicate the manner of the Moons motion about the Earth, it
appearing evidently thereby, that neither the bigger Ball, which
repre&s;ented the Earth, nor the le&s;s which repre&s;ented the Moon,
were mov'd in &s;o perfect a Circle of Ellip&s;is, as otherwi&s;e they
would have been, if either of them had been &s;u&s;pended and
mov'd &s;ingly: But that a certain Point which &s;eem'd to be the
Center of Gravity of the two Bodies (how&s;oever po&s;ited and
con&s;ider'd as one) &s;eem'd to be regularly mov'd, in &s;uch a Circle
or Ellip&s;is, the two Balls having other perculiar motions in &s;mall
Epicicles about the &s;aid Point.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>Aug.</HI> 1&s;t. 1666. he read his Ob&s;ervations of the Comet in 1664.
after Printed among his Tracts, and call'd <HI>Cometa.</HI> The &s;ame
produc'd a certain Contrivance to &s;hew that the Circular Pendu|lum
was made of two &s;trait Lines cro&s;&s;ing each other, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&endq; and
about the &s;ame time his In&s;trument to take the di&s;tance of the
Stars from the Moon, the one Object &s;een direct, the other by
Reflexion, this is publi&s;h'd in his Book, pag. 503.</P>
<P>The dreadful Conflagration of a great part of the City of <HI>Lon|don</HI>
happening in the beginning of <HI>September</HI> 1666. brought an|other
great hindrance to the <HI>Societies</HI> Proceeding; &s;o that they
were oblig'd to remove their u&s;ual place of Meeting from <HI>Gre&s;ham
College</HI> to <HI>Arundel</HI> Hou&s;e in the <HI>Strand,</HI> where, by the favour of the
then Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> they pro&s;ecuted their former Inquiries, their
fir&s;t Meeting at <HI>Arundel</HI> Hou&s;e being on the ninth of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1666-67.</P>
<P>&startq;On the nineteenth of <HI>Sep.</HI> 1666. he pruduc'd a Module he had
de&s;ign'd for the Rebuilding of the City, with which the <HI>Society</HI> were very well pleas'd, and Sir <HI>John Laurence</HI> the then late <HI>Lord
Major,</HI> addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to the <HI>Society,</HI> expre&s;&s;ing the pre&s;ent <HI>Lord
Majors and Aldermens</HI> liking thereof, as al&s;o their de&s;ire that it might
be &s;hewn to this <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> they preferring it far before the Model drawn up by the City Surveyor.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="19">
What this Model was, I cannot &s;o well determine, but I have
heard that it was defign'd in it to have all the chief Streets as
from <HI>Leaden-Hall</HI> corner to <HI>Newgate,</HI> and the like, to lie in an exact
&s;trait Line, and all the other cro&s;s Streets turning out of them at
right Angles, all the Churches, publick Buildings, Market-places,
and the like, in proper and convenient places, which, no doubt,
would have added much to the Beauty and Symmetry of the whole.
How this came not to be accepted of I know not, but it is proba|ble
this might contribute not a little to his being taken notice off
by the Magi&s;trates of the City, and &s;oon after made Surveyor.</P>
<P>The Rebuilding of the City, according to the Act of Parlia|ment,
requiring an able Per&s;on to &s;et out the Ground to the &s;eve|veral
Proprietors, Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> was pitch'd upon, and appointed <HI>City-Surveyor</HI>
for that difficult Work, which being very great, took up
a large proportion of his Time, to the no &s;mall hindrance of his
Philo&s;ophical Di&s;qui&s;itions.</P>
<P>In this Employment he got the mo&s;t part of that E&s;tate he died
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, as was evident by a large Iron Che&s;t of Money found
after his Death, which had been lock'd down with the Key in it,
with a date of the Time, by which it appear'd to have been &s;o
&s;hut up for above thirty Years: In this was contain'd the greate&s;t
part of what he left behind him, which was to the value of ma|ny
thou&s;ands in Gold and Silver. That he might by this place
ju&s;tly acquire a considerable E&s;tate, I think cannot be deny'd, eve|ry
particular Per&s;on after the Fire being in ha&s;te to have his con|cerns
expedited; &s;o that as I have been inform'd he had no Re&s;t
early and late from Per&s;ons &s;oliciting to have their Grounds &s;et out,
which, without any Fraud or Inju&s;tice, de&s;erv'd a due recompence
in &s;o fatiguing an Employ.</P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 31. 1666. He &s;hew'd his inclineing <HI>Pendulum,</HI> with the u|&s;es
thereof, to regulate the motions of a Clock as exactly as a long
one.</P>
<P>On the 9th of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1666/7. he was order'd to pro&s;ecute his Ob&s;er|vations
of the Earth's <HI>Paralax</HI> formerly by him propos'd: A large
Account of the Re&s;ult of his Ob&s;ervations therein were after Printed
in his <HI>Attempt to prove the motion of the Earth</HI> 1674, being the fir&s;t
of his <HI>Cutlerian</HI> Lectures Publi&s;h'd.</P>
<P>On the 6th of <HI>Feb.</HI> following, he produc'd his new <HI>Lamp</HI> con|triv'd
&s;o as to &s;upply the Oil in equal quantity as it wa&s;tes, that it
may never ri&s;e too much or too little, the farther De&s;cription and
Explication of which, with many curious Remarks, were Publi&s;h$d
1677. and intitl'd <HI>Lampas,</HI> or <HI>De&s;criptions of &s;ome Improvements of
Lamps and Water-poi&s;es,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> the 28th. He fir&s;t produc'd his <HI>Reflecting Tele&s;cope,</HI> which is
de&s;crib'd with the Rea&s;on of the Principle, with &s;ome other In|&s;truments
in his Treati&s;e of <HI>Helio&s;copes,</HI> Printed 1676.</P>
<P>On the 17th of <HI>June</HI> 1667. and afterwards he read large Di&s;|cour&s;es
of the Cau&s;es, Powers and Effects of <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> affirm|ing
the great Hills and Mountains in the World to have been rai&s;ed
by them, of which Subject he at &s;everal times afterwards made
very many Di&s;cour&s;es and Lectures, the mo&s;t part of which are col|lected
together in this Volume, beginning at Page 279.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="20">
In <HI>July</HI> 1667. he try'd &s;everal Experiments upon him&s;elf in an
<HI>exhau&s;ted Receiver,</HI> big enough to contain a Man, I think the only
Experiment of that kind ever try'd.</P>
<P>At this time he contriv'd a <HI>Micrometer</HI> of le&s;s Charge and Diffi|culy
than that invented by Mr. <HI>Ga&s;coin</HI> with Screws; this, I &s;up|po&s;e,
is Publi&s;h'd in this Volume, Page 498.</P>
<P><HI>Dec.</HI> 26. 1667. He brought in a farther De&s;cription of a <HI>Sea Ba|rometer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> the 16th 1667-68. he produc'd &startq;his new Contrivance of promot|ing
the Vibrations of Pendules, &s;o as to prevent all Checks, which
he affirmed had not been provided again&s;t by any Contrivance to
that time.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>Apr.</HI> 9. 1668. He produc'd two In&s;truments to promote the &s;en&s;e
of Hearing.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the 14th He &s;hew'd an Experiment of the penetration of Li|quors
in Oil of Vitriol and fair Water.</P>
<P>About this time he produc'd many other Experiments and In|ventions,
which I omit, and &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that there being
&s;everal Di&s;cour&s;es about the mea&s;uring a of Degree $span$ Earth,
he propos'd divers Methods of performing it, and invented
&s;everal In&s;truments; and as is enter'd in the Journal, <HI>Oct.</HI> 28. 1669.
Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> was of Opinion, <HI>That one of the exacte&s;t ways of
mea&s;uring, was by making accurate Ob&s;ervations of the Heavens to a &s;e|cond,
by a Perpendicular Tube, and then to take exact di&s;tances by Angels to
a &s;econd al&s;o,</HI> which I take to be the Method ob&s;erv'd by the <HI>French</HI>
not long after, as may be &s;een by a particular Treati&s;e of it Pub|li&s;h'd
by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Picart,</HI> as likewi&s;e by what <HI>Du hamel</HI> &s;ays in his
Hi&s;tory of that Society, p. 98. to which the curious are refer'd. I
find al&s;o by &s;ome Notices and loo&s;e Papers of our Curator, that he
invented a &s;ort of travelling Cale&s;h for this purpo&s;e, which &s;hould
de&s;cribe upon a Paper, not only the Men&s;uration of the way gone
over, but the &s;everal A&s;cents and De&s;cents, together with the turn|ings
and windings of the Cale&s;h, or the Points of the Compa&s;s
upon which the Per&s;on travell'd with other Contrivances, which I
know not by what misfortune, were never put in practi&s;e. There
were al&s;o other Methods for mea&s;uring a Degree propos'd to be
made in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Park on the Canal, which al&s;o had the like fate
of not being pro&s;ecuted.</P>
<P>In <HI>Jan</HI> 1669-70. He fir&s;t propos'd a drop of Mercury $word$ an univer|&s;al
Standard, which is more at large de&s;crib'd, Page 472. of the fol|lowing
Volume. And in <HI>April</HI> &s;hew'd an Experiment with a &s;o|lution
of Copper to repre&s;ent the appearance of Clouds and other
aerial Meteors, by dropping into it &s;everal Salts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and at the
&s;ame time &s;hew'd the u&s;e of introducing the Species into a dark
Room for Painting, and contriv'd a Box for that purpo&s;e, which is
here Printed.</P>
<P>In <HI>March</HI> 1671. &startq;he &s;hew'd &s;everal Experiments to explain the
Nature and Cau&s;e of <HI>Gravity:</HI> Particularly on the 9th an Ex|periment
was made, in which &s;ome Flower put into a void &s;hal|low
Gla&s;s with a large &s;loping brim, and a pretty tall Foot was
made to ri&s;e and run over like a fluid, by the knocking on the
edge of the Gla&s;s, and al&s;o by the forceably moving of ones Fin|ger
round the edge to the &s;ame. Leaden Bullets al&s;o being put
into this Gla&s;s, did, by knocking, move it like a fluid.&mdash;This
<PB N="xv" REF="21">
was propos'd to con&s;ider what might be the cau&s;e of Gravity,
and &s;ugge&s;t an Hypothe&s;is to explicate the motion of Gravity
by, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e, and &s;everal other Experiments, he &s;hew'd to explain Na|tural
Bodies and Actions, in &s;ome of which I have been the more
particular out of a hope the&s;e hints may excite &s;ome inqui&s;itive Per|&s;on
to proceed farther in &s;uch Inquiries.</P>
<P>This &s;ame Year &s;everal Di&s;cour&s;es and Papers pa&s;t between the
Learned Mr.<HI>Newton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> concerning a new Theory of
Light and Colours, which being now &s;o generally known, I &s;hall
not farther in&s;i&s;t on.</P>
<P>About this time he made a Propo&s;ition for perfecting all &s;orts of
Optick-gla&s;&s;es, the &s;ecret of which was deliver'd in an Anagram to
the Pre&s;ident my Lord <HI>Brouncher.</HI></P>
<P>Not long after this time began that unhappy Di&s;pute between
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Hevelius</HI> and <HI>Hooke</HI> concerning the preference of Plain and
Tele&s;copical Sights for A&s;tronomical In&s;truments,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Di&s;pute with</HI> Hevelius.</NOTE> which, as I can
collect, was thus occa&s;ion'd. Mr. <HI>Hooke,</HI> by means of Mr. <HI>Olden|burgh,</HI>
had recommended to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Hevelius</HI> the Application of
Tele&s;copick Sights to his exqui&s;itely contriv'd and elobrated In&s;tru|ments,
affirming that by them an Angle might be taken to a much greater
nicene&s;s than with plain Sights, and gave them a &s;hort, but
as he thought a &s;ufficient information of the manner of applying
them to the In&s;trument, and intimated that if any thing requir'd a
farther Explication, he was ready to give it. Neverthele&s;s <HI>Heve|lius</HI>
could not be prevail'd with to make u&s;e of them, whether he
thought him&s;elf too experienc'd to be inform'd by a young A&s;tro|nomer,
as he reckon'd <HI>Hooke,</HI> or whether having made &s;o many Ob|&s;ervations
with plain Sights, he was unwilling to alter his Method
lea&s;t he might bring their exactness into Question, or whether being
by long practice accustom'd to the use of them, and not thoroughly
apprehending the u&s;e of the other, nor well under&s;tanding the dif|ference,
as Mr. <HI>Molineux</HI> has ob&s;erv'd in his Opticks, is indeed un|certain.</P>
<P>Not long after came out his curious and pompous Book of the
fir&s;t part of his <HI>Machina Caele&s;tis;</HI> and <HI>Hooke</HI> took occa&s;ion in his <HI>Cut|lerian
Lectures,</HI> to read &s;everal Di&s;cour&s;es upon that Book, and the
In&s;truments therein de&s;crib'd, which were Printed <HI>Anno</HI> 1674. un|der
the Title of <HI>Animadver&s;ions upon Hevelius</HI>'s <HI>Machina Caele&s;tis.</HI></P>
<P>In which Treati&s;e vindicating &s;omewhat warmely the benefit of
Tele&s;copick Sights and their preference, he chanc'd to let &s;lip &s;ome
Expre&s;&s;ions, which, tho' po&s;&s;ibly &s;trictly true, could yet never
be dige&s;ted by <HI>Hevelim.</HI></P>
<P>Several Years after <HI>Hevelius</HI> Publi&s;h'd his <HI>Annus Climactericus,</HI>
which again reviv'd the Di&s;pute, and caus'd &s;everal Learned Men
to intere&s;t them&s;elves in the Controver&s;y. This, I think, is the
true Hi&s;tory of the Matter. I &s;hall here &s;ubjoin what <HI>Hooke</HI> wrote
him&s;elf in An&s;wer to what &s;ome Per&s;ons thought fit to write upon
this Subject, as I found them drawn up by him&s;elf in a Paper or
two among his Manu&s;cripts; for the better under&s;tanding of which,
I &s;hall ob&s;erve, Fir&s;t, That <HI>Hevelius</HI> having &s;ent his <HI>Annus Climacteri|cus</HI>
to the ROYAL SOCIETY, Dr. <HI>Wallis</HI> was de&s;ir'd to give an
account of it, which is Printed in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions</HI> N^o.
175. p. 1162, in which the Dr. having u&s;ed &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions which

<HI>Hooke,</HI> thought reflected too &s;everely upon him; and Mr. <HI>Moli|neux</HI>
not long after &s;ending a Letter to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, he wrote
his own Vindication almo&s;t verbatim, as I have here Printed it, at
lea&s;t nothing material is omitted or added.</P>
<P>&startq;There having been lately read in a Meeting of this Honour|able
<HI>Society</HI> a Letter from Mr. <HI>Molineux</HI> containing &s;everal Re|flections
that concern'd me, which, without &s;ome &s;atisfactory an|swer;
mu&s;t needs make me &s;uffer in the Opinion of tho&s;e who
have not truly under&s;tood the Matter in Controver&s;y, and the
high E&s;teem I have of the Ju&s;tice and Judgment of this Illu&s;tri|ous
Company, per&s;uades me the rather to make my Defence here.&endq;</P>
<Q>&startq;The Objections in the Letter were the&s;e.&endq;</Q>
<P>&startq;That if it be true which has been a&s;&s;erted, not only by &s;ome
celebrated A&s;tronomers, but chiefly by Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> in his <HI>Animad|ver&s;ions,</HI>
&amp;c. the Indeavours of <HI>Hevelius</HI> will be fru&s;trated and his
va&s;t Charges to no more purpo&s;e than <HI>Ticho</HI>'s and all his &s;plendid
<HI>apparatus</HI> but meer Lumber; for upon this Que&s;tion as to plain
Sights, the price of his A&s;tronomical Labours of his whole Life
depends; but &s;urely this were an Event highly deplorable, not
only to the party him&s;elf immediately concern'd, but the whole
<HI>Re&s;publica Literaria.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>Secondly, Mention is made of the &s;lightne&s;s and &s;mallne&s;s of
&startq;what I had publi&s;h'd, which was only a Pamphlet, that a&s;&s;erted,
that notwith&s;tanding all this, yet meerly for want of Tele&s;copick
Sights and &s;ome new kind of invented Divi&s;ions on Mr. <HI>Hevelius</HI>'s
In&s;truments, I went &s;o far as to doubt whether his Ob&s;ervations
could be true, and always the &s;ame to two or three Minutes, and
that the whole import of it be&s;ides this, was nothing but the De|&s;cription
of an In&s;trument which he never heard was put in practice.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Third Objection again&s;t me is that, tho' Mon&s;ieur <HI>Heve|lius</HI>
had earne&s;tly reque&s;ted from me, or any one el&s;e that had Te|le&s;copick
In&s;truments, to &s;end him &s;ome di&s;tances of fixt Stars
ob&s;erv'd by them, yet he could never be &s;o happy as to obtain a|ny
from me, tho' afterwards he did from &s;ome others, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e, and &s;ome other Di&s;cour&s;es, &s;pread abroad tacitely in&s;i|nuate,
that the Publi&s;hing tho&s;e <HI>Animadver&s;ions</HI> was a very ill
Action, and that the Learned in general have receiv'd a great pre|judice
thereby, it concerns me therefore to clear my &s;elf of this
Imputation: For An&s;wer then I &s;ay,&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Fir&s;t, If what I have Publi&s;h'd in tho&s;e <HI>Animadversions</HI> be true
and certain, then I de&s;ire to know whether it were better for the
<HI>Re&s;publica Literaria</HI> to be acquainted with it, or to remain po&s;&s;e&s;t
with the belief of &s;ome A&s;&s;ertions of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Hevelius,</HI> which
are really Mi&s;takes (not to &s;ay wor&s;e) tho' po&s;&s;ibly till that time,
wherein I publish'd them, they were generally believ'd to be Truths,
as he has taken a great deal of pains to induce a belief of, in the fir&s;t
part of his <HI>Machina Caele&s;tis,</HI> from Page 293, to Page 300, which I
<PB N="xvii" REF="23">
the rather mention, becau&s;e &s;ome Per&s;ons have thought and a&s;|&s;erted,
that I was the fir&s;t Aggre&s;&s;or in Print, the contrary of
which tho&s;e &s;ix Pages evince.&endq;</P>
<P>Secondly, &startq;Whether tho&s;e deplorable Events of le&s;&s;ening the
price of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Hevelius</HI>'s Works, if that were true, when
put into the Ballance, will out-weigh the detecting a Mi&s;take, or
di&s;covery of a Truth in a matter of &s;o great Moment in Natu|ral
Philo&s;ophy, as concerns the mo&s;t con&s;iderable parts of Know|ledge
in the Theory of the Univer&s;e, e&s;pecially of Cele&s;tial Bo|dies;
for if Truth be that which is mo&s;t prevalent with all Phi|lo&s;ophical
Spirits again&s;t any particular Intere&s;t, then I hope I &s;hall
prove I have not offended in that particular in my publication of
tho&s;e <HI>Animadver&s;ions.</HI> And <HI>Hevelius</HI> him&s;elf was of the &s;ame
Mind, when at the &s;ixty fir&s;t Page of his Preface he writes
(&s;peaking of his di&s;paraging &s;ome things of <HI>Ticho Brahe) in hoc ne|gotio
&s;emper in cuju&s;uis animo haerere debet. Amicus Plato, Amicus
Ari&s;toteles, &s;ed magis tamen amica veritas.</HI> Nor do I find him &s;o
&s;hy in proclaiming the Mi&s;takes of <HI>Ticho</HI>'s Ob&s;ervations, when it
made for his own Reputation; for in the thirty fourth Page of his
Preface he &s;ays, that the greate&s;t part of <HI>Ticho</HI>'s Ob&s;ervations dif|fer'd
from his own four, five, &s;ix, and even ten Min. At the
thirty ninth Page he &s;ays, That of 780 in <HI>Ticho</HI>'s Catalogue there
are but 260 which differ, not le&s;s than two Minutes; but all the
re&s;t differ 3#. 5#. 10#. 20#. 30#. 40#. 45#. 50#. nay a whole Degree from
the truth, and that fifteen differ above a Degree, and &s;ome many
more, even to eight Degrees in Longitude, and in Latitude to
thirteen whole Degrees, &s;ometimes in defect, &s;ometimes in ex|ce&s;s,
yet for all this <HI>Hevelius</HI> would be thought highly to value
<HI>Ticho Brahe,</HI> and not to have made any Reflections upon him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nor has the detecting Mi&s;takes even in Per&s;ons of as great
Fame been look'd upon &s;o ill a thing, but rather a meritorious
Action, as might be in&s;tanc'd in Dr. <HI>Pell</HI>'s &s;hort An&s;wer in a &frac14; of
a Sheet of Paper to <HI>Longomontanus</HI> his Work, which had been the
bu&s;ine&s;s of thirty Years. Another in&s;tance may be of <HI>Phocilides</HI>
upon <HI>Lansbergius,</HI> the learned <HI>Savilian A&s;tronomick Profe&s;&s;or</HI> again&s;t
<HI>Bulialdus,</HI> &amp;c. all which Authors were well e&s;teem'd for their de|tecting
Mi&s;takes, and di&s;covering Truth. And as for any di&s;re|&s;pectful
or undervaluing Sentiments I had of <HI>Hevelius</HI> or his Per|formances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 43, &amp; 44.</NOTE>
I hope what I have printed in my <HI>Admadver&s;ions</HI> will
prevail with the unprejudiced to believe the contrary; where I
&s;ay, <HI>That I would not be under&s;tood by the&s;e Animadver&s;ions to under|value
the Works and Performances of a Per&s;on &s;o highly meriting the
Thanks of the Learned World for his great Expence and va&s;t Pains, in
performing a Work &s;o highly u&s;eful to A&s;tronomy and Navigation, that
I did not in the lea&s;t doubt but that it would be a Work of perpetual
E&s;teem, and much preferrable to any thing of the like kind yet done in the
World; and that he had gone as far as was po&s;&s;ible for humane Indu&s;try
to go with In&s;truments of that kind, which were as compleat and exact
as In&s;truments with plain Sights could be made; and that he had calcu|lated
with all imaginable care and skill, and deliver'd them with the like
Candor and Integrity: But yet that it was my Opinion, that this ought
not to di&s;courage others from making u&s;e of Tele&s;cope-&s;ights, and to make
better Ob&s;ervations with In&s;truments by that means more exact.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="xviii" REF="24">
&startq;This I hope may Apologize for my writing tho&s;e <HI>Animadver&s;ions.</HI>&endq;
&startq;But in the next place I mu&s;t make &s;ome defence for what is
&s;aid in them. This Gentleman &s;ays I went &s;o far as to doubt
whether <HI>Hevelius</HI>'s Ob&s;ervations could be made true and always
the &s;ame to two or three Minutes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Animadver&s;i|ons,</HI> Pag. 7.</NOTE> I wi&s;h the place had been quo|ted
where I &s;aid &s;o, &s;ince I only &s;aid that I believ'd it impo&s;&s;ible
for any one to di&s;tingui&s;h with common Sights any di&s;tance in
the Heavens to le&s;s than half a Minute, and very few to a Mi|nute,
and I am apt to believe there may be &s;ome in&s;tances even
in <HI>Hevelius</HI>'s Catalogue that will verify this A&s;&s;ertion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And for any other A&s;&s;ertion, which is <HI>really mine</HI> in that Trea|ti&s;e,
I do not doubt of &s;ati&s;fying any unprejudiced Per&s;on by ex|periment,
if de&s;ir'd, which I &s;ay, is <HI>really my A&s;&s;ertion;</HI> for by
mi&s;take or otherwi&s;e, &s;ome things have been fathered upon me
I never &s;aid, <HI>viz.</HI> that I &s;hould a&s;&s;ert, <HI>That an In&s;trument of a &s;pan
Radius might be made, that &s;hould perform Ob&s;ervations &s;ixty times more
accurate than could be done with his be&s;t In&s;truments:</HI> Which A&s;&s;er|tion
is none of mine, and whoever have &s;pread the&s;e Fal&s;ities,
might have found better Employment. I &s;ay indeed, that a very
&s;mall In&s;trument, curiou&s;ly made, exactly divided and in&s;tructed
with Tele&s;cope-Sights will perform much better in all Ob&s;erva|tions
(except of the Sun) than the large&s;t In&s;trument without
&s;uch Sights, for the rea&s;on before alledged from the defect in our
Eyes which cannot di&s;tingui&s;h an Angle le&s;s than half a Minute,
nor is this a defect in my own Eyes only (as <HI>Hevelius</HI> &s;omewhere &s;eems
to hint) for the Experiment may ea&s;ily be try'd with the be&s;t Eyes.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nor is it any di&s;paragement to <HI>Hevelius</HI>'s Ob&s;ervations to com|pare
them with <HI>Ticho Brahe</HI>'s, tho' I &s;hould have &s;uppos'd them
but of equal value, &s;ince the mere repeating of his Ob&s;ervations
would be of great u&s;e in A&s;tronomy, the&s;e being almo&s;t one hun|dred
Years after his; for we mu&s;t by &s;uch compari&s;ons judge
of many con&s;iderable inquiries concerning Cele&s;tial Bodies, which
cannot by other means be &s;o well detected, for which I refer to
the &s;eventy &s;ixth Page of my <HI>Animadver&s;ions,</HI> viz. to know whe|ther
tho&s;e Cele&s;tial Bodies which are &s;uppos'd &s;o fixt, do not vary
their Po&s;itions to each other, and al&s;o their Magnitudes, which I
had good grounds to believe.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to the Objection that my Pamphlet contain'd <HI>little be&s;ides the
De&s;cription of an In&s;trument never put in practice.</HI> I conceive there
may be &s;everal Mi&s;takes; for I am of Opinion, upon peru&s;al there
will be &s;omewhat el&s;e in that Treati&s;e worth con&s;ideration. Next
that there has been In&s;truments made, perfected and u&s;ed after
that way, by Sir <HI>Jonas More,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Gregory</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> by Mr.
<HI>Halley,</HI> and many others, and I believe very few A&s;tronomical In|&s;truments
&s;ince have been made with plain Sights; and if the multiude of Authorities were nece&s;&s;ary, I could produce <HI>Auzout,
Picart, Mariot, Romer, De la Hire, Montanari, Gotignies,</HI> and o|thers,
not to name tho&s;e of our own Nation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to my not returning the Ob&s;ervations of certain di&s;tances
of Stars, which <HI>Hevelius</HI> de&s;ir'd, 'tis &s;ufficiently known what in|conveniences
we lay under in this place after the Fire of <HI>London,</HI>
and had I found conveniences, yet the unkind Reception tho&s;e
things found, which I &s;ent him, was enough to deter me from
&s;uch a Compliance; tho' he was &s;en&s;ible how I had often been rea|dy
<PB N="xix" REF="25">
to gratify his Curio&s;ity in many other particulars. But when
his <HI>Machina Caele&s;tis</HI> was publi&s;h'd, I was oblig'd to write tho&s;e <HI>A|nimadver&s;ions,</HI>
in which I hope all unprejudic'd Readers will ju&s;tify
my proceedure, at lea&s;t I am ready to prove any thing I have
therein a&s;&s;erted.&endq;</P>
<P>I have been the larger in the Account of this Controver&s;y that
the intelligent Reader may make the better judgment thereof, it being
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable he ever had with any Per&s;on, and &s;hall
wave the giving my Opinion of it.</P>
<P>In 1674. he &s;hew'd an Engine or In&s;trument to perform any A|rithmetical
Operation, but the more particular account of this and
other In&s;truments not de&s;crib'd in this Volume, I &s;hall re&s;erve for
another opportunity.</P>
<P>About the latter end of the &s;ame Year the ROYAL SOCIETY
kept their Weekly Meeting at <HI>Gre&s;ham College</HI> again, and on the fif|teenth
of <HI>Jan.</HI> following he &s;hew'd a way to determine how &s;mall
an Angle the una&s;&s;i&s;ted Eye is able to di&s;cern, by which it was found,
that none of the Per&s;ons Eyes pre&s;ent could ob&s;erve a much le&s;s An|gle
than of a Minute; for a more ample account of which the Rea|der
is referr'd to the eighth Page of his <HI>Animadversions.</HI></P>
<P>From this time many Magnetical Experiments were made by
him, and on the nineteenth of <HI>March</HI> he propos'd a Theory of the
variation, the &s;ub&s;tance of which was this, &startq;That the Magnet hath its peculiar Poles di&s;tant ten Degrees from the Poles of the
Earth, about which they move &s;o as to make a Revolution in
three hundred and &s;eventy Years, whence the variation hath al|tered
of late about ten or eleven Minutes every Year, and will
probably continue &s;o to do for &s;ome time, till it begins to grow
&s;lower and &s;lower, and will at length be Stationary and Retro|grade,
and in probability may return; but whether it will be &s;o or
not Time mu&s;t &s;hew. At the &s;ame time he propos'd the making
of a very ea&s;y and nice In&s;trument to ob&s;erve the variation of the
variations of the Needle in different parts of the World.&endq;</P>
<P>What this In&s;trument was is not ea&s;y now to be determin'd, but
the Reader will find the Figure of an In&s;trument &s;omething to this
purpo&s;e at Page 486.</P>
<P>On the 4th of <HI>Feb.</HI> 1674-75. &s;everal Ob&s;ervations and Di&s;cour&s;es
having been made about the Structure of the Mu&s;cles of Animals,
Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> &s;aid, &startq;That his Ob&s;ervation was, that the fle&s;hy part of
a Mu&s;cle con&s;i&s;ted of an infinite number of exceeding &s;mall round
Pipes, extended between the two tendons of the Mu&s;cles, and
&s;eem'd to end in them. Which Tendons, in the Mu&s;cles of Beef
boyl'd would be ea&s;ily &s;tript off from tho&s;e Pipes, and &s;o leave the
round ends of tho&s;e Pipes very di&s;tinct and vi&s;ible: He &s;aid that
the rea&s;on of the moving of a Mu&s;cle might be from the filling
or emptying of tho&s;e Pipes, who&s;e &s;ides &s;eem'd to be flexible like
tho&s;e of a Gut. He intimated al&s;o, that he knew a way of mak|ing
succedaneous Mu&s;cles for a Man to &s;upply the defect of his
Mu&s;cles for flying, and give one Man the &s;trength of ten or
twenty, if required.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>March</HI> the 18th 1674-75. he made an Experiment of a new proper|ty
of Light, having before read &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;es upon that Sub|ject.&endq;

for the prolated Oval Figure of the Planets, &s;ome of which are
Printed in this Volume, Page 355. with a Demon&s;trat$on thereof,
and &s;aid, &startq;That all Fluids on the Surface would run into that

about the Earth might do &s;o by the influence of the diurnal Mo|tion

conceiv'd was the cau&s;e of the Tides.&endq;</P>

Fibres of the Mu&s;cles which &s;eem'd like a Necklace of Pearl in
the Micro&s;cope, might be fill'd with a very agill Matter, which
he thought mo&s;t likely to be Air, which being included in &s;o thin

their own Gravity, and not according to the &s;pace they take up in
the Atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>Some Contrivances were &s;hewn by him to be added to the Wea|ther-Clock,
as a Hygro&s;cope, a contrivance to mea&s;ure the quan|tity
of Rain, Snow, or Hail fallen in a certain time; which En|gine
was soon alter perfected in all its parts, and &s;et up in the Re|po&s;itory.</P>
<P>In <HI>July</HI> 1679. he read a Di&s;cour&s;e concerning a way to help &s;hor|ted
Sighted Per&s;ons, which he call'd <HI>Myopibus Invamen;</HI> this is Prin|ted
in his third Collection, p. 59. &startq;At the &s;ame time he gave his
Thoughts of the rea&s;on of the different apparent Magnitude of
the Sun and Moon in the Meridian and near the Horizon, which
he &s;uppos'd to be a deception of the Eye as judging them when near
the Horizon, to be farther off than when nearer the Zenith, for
that he &s;aid the Diameters mea&s;ur'd were really the &s;ame in both
places, or rather &s;omething le&s;s in the Horizon than in the Zenith,
being remov'd a Semidiameter of the Earth farther off.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="xxii" REF="28">
Experiments were made by him of the mixtures of Metals, par|ticularly
of Copper and Tin, in which there was ob&s;erv'd a real
Penetration, the <HI>Compo&s;itum</HI> being &s;pecifically heavier than either
of the Metals before mixture; for whereas Copper is to Water as 8
&frac12; to 1. and Tin to Water as 7 17/30 to 1. the compo&s;itum was to Water
as 8 &frac34; to 1.</P>
<P>&startq;In <HI>December,</HI> the &s;ame Year, an Experiment being &s;ugge&s;ted to
try whether the Earth mov'd with a diurnal motion or not, by the
fall of a Body from a con&s;iderable height, alledging it would fall to
the Ea&s;t of true Perpendicular: Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> read a Di&s;cour&s;e up|on
that Subject, wherein he explain'd what the Line de&s;crib'd by
a falling Body mu&s;t be, &s;uppos'd to be mov'd circularly by the di|urnal
motion of the Earth, and perpendicularly by the power of
Gravity, and &s;hew'd it would not be a Spiral Line, but an Ex|centrical-Elliptoeid,
&s;uppo&s;ing no re&s;i&s;tance in the <HI>medium,</HI> but &s;up|po&s;ing
a Re&s;i&s;tance, it would be an Excentric-Ellipti-Spiral,
which after many Revolutions, would re&s;t in the Center at la&s;t;
that the fall of the Body would not be directly Ea&s;t, but to the
South-Ea&s;t, and more to the South than the Ea&s;t. This was try'd,
in which the Ball was &s;till found to fall to the South-East.&endq;</P>
<P>The remainder of this Year was &s;pent in making Experiments
of the mixture of &s;everal Metals, among the re&s;t Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> took
notice in the mixture of Copper and Tin of &s;everal particulars, as Fir&s;t,
&startq;That the colour of the Copper was quite de&s;troy'd, it ap|pearing
much of the colour of Iron Poli&s;h'd. Secondly, That
the Compo&s;ition, tho' made of two very malleable Metals, was
yet very brittle and friable. Thirdly, That it bore a pretty good
Poli&s;h and Reflection. Fourthly, That tho' Copper is exceeding
hard to be melted, yet the mixture melted very ea&s;ily. Fifthly,
That viewing the Poli&s;h'd Surface with a Micro&s;cope, he found
it very full of very &s;mall holes or blebs in the Metal.&endq;</P>
<P>In <HI>April</HI> 1680. he produc'd a new invented Level.</P>
<P>In <HI>May</HI> he read a Paper of Ob&s;ervations upon an unusual &s;ort of
Hail-&s;tones that fell on the 18th. the &s;um of which was to this pur|po&s;e.
About ten a Clock in the Morning it grew very dark and
Thundered much, and near to the S. E. when &s;oon after the Hail
fell from the &s;ize of Pi&s;tol-Bullets to the bigne&s;s of Pullets Eggs,
the &s;maller were white like Chalk, and pretty round, the larger
Conical or Oval, upon breaking them they were found to be
made of &s;everal Orbs, encompa&s;&s;ing one another; &s;everal had a
white Center or Nucleus in the middle, which in others was more
toward one &s;ide; they that exceeded in bigne&s;s were made by an
additional accretion of tran&s;parent Icecles, radiating from the
white Ball in the middle; &s;ome of the&s;e &s;tood in di&s;tinct tran&s;pa|rent
Rays, in others the Inter&s;tices were fill'd up between the Rays
with a white opaque Concretion: The lower part of the&s;e Stones
were more flat and like a Turnip, the radiations appearing more
towards the upper &s;ide; the &s;ides and top were more rough, and
the ends of the Stiriae were prominent. Before they fell a great
noi&s;e was heard in the Sky: From the manner of their Figure Mr.
<HI>Hooke</HI> conceiv'd their accretion was made by a congelation of Wa|ter
as they fell; that the Globe in the middle about the bigness of
a Pea, was the fir&s;t drop that concreted into Hail, the Coats being
added to it as it pa&s;t through the watry Clouds&punc; of which &s;ome
<PB N="xxiii" REF="29">
were white, &s;ome pellucid, according to the different coldne&s;s of
the Regions they pa&s;t through.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 8th 1680. upon a Debate concerning the Experiment of my
Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>'s of the internal motion of Bodies, Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> related,
&startq;That he had ob&s;erv'd that the motion of the Gla&s;s, fill'd with
Water, was ob&s;erv'd to be vibrative, perpendicular to the Sur|face
of the Gla&s;s, and that the Circular Figure chang'd into an
Oval one way, and that the Reciprocation pre&s;ently changed it
into an Oval the other way, which he di&s;cover'd by the motion
of the Undulation or ri&s;ing of the Water in the Gla&s;s, which was
ob&s;erv'd to be in four places of the Surface in a &s;quare po&s;ture,
the &s;ame Gla&s;s being &s;truck on the edge with a Viol-bow, this &s;quare
Undulation was very plain, and there was al&s;o di&s;cover'd
another Undulation, by which the Water was ob&s;erv'd to ri&s;e in
&s;ix places like an Hexagon, and upon farther trials al&s;o in eight
places like an Octagon; each of the&s;e gave their particular and
di&s;tinct Sounds or Notes, the 4 and 8 were Octaves, and the 6 and
4 were Fifths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>In <HI>November</HI> 1680. he read &s;ome Ob&s;ervations he had made of a
<HI>Comet</HI> then appearing, which, with other Ob&s;ervations and Di&s;|cour&s;es
of other Comets are publi&s;h'd in this Volume under that
Title, beginning at Page 194.</P>
<P>And about this time Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> &s;hew'd a Contrivance by a <HI>Statera</HI>
to examine the attractive power of the Magnet at &s;everal di&s;tances,
and made many Experiments therewith.</P>
<P>In <HI>April</HI> 1681. and afterwards, he read his Lectures of <HI>Light</HI> and
<HI>Luminous</HI> Bodies, which are here collected together, and begin at
Page 71.</P>
<P>In <HI>July</HI> the &s;ame Year he &s;hew'd a way of making <HI>Mu&s;ical and other Sounds,</HI>
by the &s;triking of the Teeth of &s;everal Bra&s;s Wheels,
proportionally cut as to their numbers, and turned very fa&s;t round,
in which it was ob&s;ervable, that the equal or proportional &s;troaks
of the Teeth, that is, 2 to 1, 4 to 3, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> made the Mu&s;ical Notes,
but the unequal &s;troaks of the Teeth more an&s;wer'd the &s;ound of
the Voice in &s;peaking.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> following he mention'd a new Sea-Quadrant for mak|ing
Ob&s;ervations more accurate than could be done by any In&s;tru|ment
yet known; this is what the Reader will find towards the
end of this Volume: At the &s;ame time he fir&s;t mention'd his new
Compa&s;&s;es for de&s;cribing all &s;orts of Spirals, as likewi&s;e of the
Rumb-lines, which In&s;trument I also have indeavour'd to retrieve
from being lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Soon after this he &s;hew'd and demon&s;trated a very expeditious
way of drawing the Rumb-lines exactly true upon a Globe, by an
In&s;trument grounded upon the &s;ame Principle with the other. He
&s;how'd al&s;o a very ea&s;y way of finding all the po&s;&s;ible <HI>foci</HI> of Rays
refracted by a <HI>Plano-Spherical Lens,</HI> whereof the Convex &s;ide was
turn'd toward the <HI>focus,</HI> as al&s;o the quantity of Rays that would
pa&s;s thro' &s;uch a Gla&s;s, who&s;e Convexity was of the full bigne&s;s of
a Hemi&s;phere.</P>
<P>&startq;In <HI>Jan.</HI> 1681-82. he &s;hew'd an In&s;trument to de&s;cribe all &s;orts of
Helixes upon a Cone, by which he affirm'd to be able to divide any
given length, tho' very &s;hort, into almo&s;t any a&s;&s;ignable number
of given parts, as &s;uppo&s;e an Inch into 100000 equal parts; this
<PB N="xxiv" REF="30">
he conceiv'd very u&s;eful for perfecting A&s;tronomical and Geogra|phical
In&s;truments. And at the next Meeting he produc'd ano|ther
In&s;trument, by which he de&s;crib'd a certain Curve Line,
which may be call'd an <HI>Invented Parabola,</HI> or <HI>Parabolical-Hyperbo|la,</HI>
having the&s;e Proprieties, that it is infinite both ways, and
hath two <HI>A&s;ymptotes</HI> as an <HI>Hyperbola,</HI> &amp;c. A third In&s;trument
was al&s;o &s;hew'd for exactly describing the <HI>Spiral</HI> of <HI>Archimedes</HI> by
a new Propriety thereof, and that as ea&s;ily and truly as a Circle,
whereby not only any given Arch might be divided into any
number of equal parts, but a &s;trait Line given equal to the Cir|cumference
of a Circle.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>March</HI> the fir&s;t, he &s;hew'd a way, by the &s;ame In&s;trument, of
de&s;cribing all varieties of Ellip&s;es.&endq;</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Year he read the remainder of his Di&s;cour&s;es of <HI>Light,</HI>
which are in the following Volume Printed, and particularly that
Lecture explicating the Memory, and how we come by the notion
of Time.</P>
<P>From this time, or rather &s;omething before, he began to be more
re&s;erv'd than he had been formerly, &s;o that altho' he often made
Experiments, and &s;hew'd new In&s;truments and Inventions, and
read his <HI>Cutlerian</HI> Lectures, yet he &s;eldom left any full Account of
them to be enter'd, de&s;igning, as he &s;aid, to fit them him&s;elf for
the Pre&s;s, and then make them publick, which he never perform'd.
This is the rea&s;on that I am oblig'd to be the &s;horter in the remain|ing
part of his Life; and &s;hall only touch upon &s;ome few of his Per|formances,
&s;ince the bare nameing of them, or mentioning their
Titles, will but create an unea&s;y Curio&s;ity in the Reader without
any &s;ati&s;faction.</P>
<P>Several of the&s;e Lectures and Di&s;cour&s;es I have indeavour'd to
pre&s;erve from being lo&s;t, by Publi&s;hing them in this Book, and &s;ome
In&s;truments are there de&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Year 1687. his Brothers Daughter, Mrs.
<HI>Grace Hooke</HI> dy'd, who had liv'd with him &s;everal Years, the con|cern
for who&s;e Death he hardly ever wore off, being ob&s;erv'd from
that time to grow le&s;s active, more Melancholly and Cynical.</P>
<P>On the fifth of <HI>May</HI> he read a Lecture of the unequal <HI>diurnal</HI> mo|tion
of the Earth, which the Reader may find in this Book</P>
<P>In <HI>July</HI> he &s;hew'd an Experiment of the communication of Mo|tion
by a Packthread extended a very con&s;iderable length, and, af|ter
running over a Pulley, brought back to the place, near to which
the other end was fa&s;tened, and it was found that any addition of
Weight or Motion given to the one end, would be immediately
&s;en&s;ible at the other end of the String, tho' it mu&s;t pa&s;s in going and
returning &s;o great a length; there were other ways &s;hewn of com|municating
motion, as by a long Cane &s;u&s;pended by Strings, or by
Wires di&s;tended a great length; in which it was ob&s;ervable, that
the &s;ound was propagated in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, even as quick as the mo|tion
of Light, the &s;ound convey'd by the Air coming a con&s;iderable
time after that by the Wire.</P>
<P>A great part of the next Year he was very weak and ill, being
often troubl'd with Head-achs, Giddine&s;s and Fainting, and with a
general decay all over, which hinder'd his Philo&s;ophical Studies,
yet &s;till he read &s;ome Lectures whenever he was able. At the &s;ame
time a Chancery-Suit, which he was forc'd to have with Sir <HI>John
<PB N="xxv" REF="31">
Cutler</HI> for his yearly Salary, made him very unea&s;y, the trouble of
which increas'd his Illne&s;s.</P>
<P>But on the 20th of <HI>June</HI> he read a farther De&s;cription con|cerning
&s;everal ways of making a portable <HI>Sea-Barometer,</HI> with the
great u&s;es thereof in foretelling changes of the Weather and Storms.</P>
<P>From this time, for &s;ome Years, I find but little done by him, ex|cept
his reading the Lectures founded by Sir <HI>John Cutler,</HI> &s;everal of
which are here Printed, to which the curious are referr'd: Of the&s;e
he read in <HI>Dec.</HI> 1691. &s;everal relating to improvements of &s;ounding
In&s;truments which he call'd <HI>Nuntii inanimati ad fundum Aby&s;&s;i emi&s;|&s;arii.</HI>
Having receiv'd a warrant from Dr. <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI> the Arch-bi&s;hop
of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> for a <HI>Degree of Dr. of Phy&s;ick,</HI> he went on the 7th of
<HI>Dec.</HI> the &s;ame Year, and took the Oaths before Sir <HI>Charles Hedges</HI> in
<HI>Doctors Commons.</HI></P>
<P>About this time he was employ'd about the contriving and &s;urvey|ing
the Ho&s;pital &s;tanding near <HI>Hoxton,</HI> given by the Will of Alder|man
<HI>Ask,</HI> a Building that few will judge any di&s;reputation to the
Contriver, for the due proportion of its Parts, and Beauty of the
whole. I have heard indeed that Dr. <HI>Hooke</HI> has been blam'd for ex|ceeding
the Sum at fir&s;t propos'd to be expended thereon; and once
di&s;cour&s;ing with him upon that Subject, he own'd to me that it had
far exceeded the fir&s;t E&s;timate he had given in of the Charges, but
not by this Fault or Mi&s;take, but partly by new additions and al|terations
of the fir&s;t De&s;ign, and chiefly by his not procuring and
agreeing with the Workmen him&s;elf, which if he had done, as he
&s;aid, he would have ingag'd it &s;hould have come to little or no more
than his fir&s;t propo&s;'d Sum. He al&s;o propos'd that there might be
in&s;tituted in that place, a <HI>Mathematical</HI>-School for Boys to be in|&s;tructed
in the Principles of <HI>A&s;tronomy</HI> and <HI>Navigation,</HI> which at fir&s;t
was well approv'd of by the per&s;ons concern'd in the Management
of that Affair.</P>
<P>On <HI>Thursday</HI> the 8th of <HI>Sep.</HI> 1692. he &s;ets down an Earthquake to
be ob&s;erv'd by him&s;elf exactly 55 Min. pa&s;t one a Clock p. m. he
notes that there was no Wind but Rain all Day. It was remark|able
that this Earthquake was felt at the &s;ame time not only in mo&s;t
parts of <HI>England,</HI> but al&s;o in &s;everal parts of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>This Year he read a curious Di&s;cour&s;e de&s;cribing the Tower of
<HI>Babel</HI> or <HI>Belus.</HI> The Year following he read &s;everal Lectures about
Earthquakes, and an Explication of <HI>Ovid's Metamorpho&s;is,</HI> of which
it is needle&s;s to mention the Contents, or the Times, the Dates of mo&s;t
of them being affixed to them in the following Book, they be|gin
at Page</P>
<P>On the 18th of <HI>July</HI> 1696. being his Birth Day, his Chancery-Suit
for Sir <HI>John Cutler</HI>'s Salary, was determined for him, to his great
&s;atisfaction, which had made him very unea&s;y for &s;everal Years. In
his Diary he &s;hews his &s;en&s;e of it in the&s;e Terms DOMSHLGISS:
A. which I read thus <HI>Deo Opt. Max. &s;ummus Honor, Gloria in &s;ecula &s;e|cularum,
Amen. I was Born on this Day of</HI> July 1635. <HI>and</HI> GOD <HI>has
given me a new Birth, may I never forget his Mercies to me; whil&s;t he
gives me Breath may I prai&s;e him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>March</HI> the 5th 1697-98. he read a Lecture about the prolated Sphe|roedical
Figure of the Sun, and other <HI>Phaenomena</HI> thereof, of the
<HI>Maculae</HI> and <HI>Faculae,</HI> &amp;c. of making a Helio&s;cope by four reflex
Planes in a twenty four Foot Tube, or a Tele&s;cope for Planets and
<PB N="xxvi" REF="32">
fix'd Stars, by two Reflexions in a Tube of forty Foot with Mon|&s;ieur
<HI>Huygens</HI> 120 Foot Gla&s;s, which was well lik'd of.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 27. 1698. he read a Lecture upon <HI>Huygen's Co&s;motheoros,</HI> and
&s;hew'd a Module of <HI>Saturn</HI> and his Ring.</P>
<P>Thus I have mention'd &s;ome of his Performances, in the latter of
which I have been the more &s;uccinct, having exceeded the bounds I
at fir&s;t intended in the Accounts of the former. It mu&s;t be confe&s;|&s;ed
that the later part of his Life was nothing near so fruitful of
Inventions as the former; tho' it is certain he had a design to repeat
the mo&s;t part of his Experiments, and fini&s;h the Accounts, Ob|servations
and Deductions from them, and had an Order for the So|cieties
bearing the Charge thereof, in <HI>June</HI> 1696. when he propos'd
likewi&s;e to perfect the De&s;cription of all the In&s;truments he had at
any time contriv'd; but by rea&s;on of his increa&s;ing Weakne&s;s and
a general Decay, he was ab&s;olutely unable to perform it, had he
de&s;ir'd it never &s;o much.</P>
<P>He had for &s;everal Years been often taken with a giddine&s;s in his
Head, and &s;ometimes great Pain, little Appetite, and great faint|ne&s;s,
that he was &s;oon very much tir'd with walking, or any Exer|ci&s;e.
About <HI>July</HI> 1697. he began to complain of the &s;welling and
&s;orene&s;s of his Legs, and was much over-run with the Scurvy, and
about the &s;ame time being taken with a giddine&s;s he fell down Stairs
and cut his Head, bruis'd his Shoulder, and hurt his Ribbs, of
which he complain'd often to the la&s;t. About <HI>September</HI> he thought
himself (as indeed all others did that &s;aw him) that he could not la&s;t
out a Month. About which time his Legs &s;well'd more and more,
and not long after broke, and for want of due care Mortify'd a lit|tle
before his Death. From this time he grew blinder and blinder,
that at la&s;t he could neither &s;ee to Read nor Write. Some of
the la&s;t he wrote, I believe was on the 17th of <HI>Dec.</HI> 1702. when he &s;ets
down a Memorandum about an In&s;trument to take the Horizontal
Diameter of the Sun to the tenth of a &s;econd Minute, but di&s;co|vers
not the way.</P>
<P>Thus he liv'd a dying Life for a con&s;iderable time, being more
than a Year very infirm, and &s;uch as might be call'd Bed-rid for
the greate&s;t part, tho' indeed he &s;eldom all the time went to Bed
but kept in his Cloaths, and when over tir'd, lay down upon his
Bed in them, which doubtle&s;s brought &s;everal Inconveniences upon
him, &s;o that at la&s;t his Di&s;tempers of &s;hortne&s;s of Breath, Swelling,
partly of his Body, but mo&s;tly of his Legs, increa&s;ing, and at la&s;t
Mortifying, as was ob&s;erv'd after his Death by their looking very
black, being emaciated to the utmo&s;t, his Strength wholly worn
out, he dy'd on the third of <HI>March</HI> 1702-03. being 67 Years, 7 Months,
and 13 Days Old.</P>
<P>His Corps was decently and hand&s;omely interr'd in the Church
of St. <HI>Hellen</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> all the Members of the ROYAL SOCIETY
then in Town attending his Body to the Grave, paying the Re&s;pect
due to his extraordinary Merit.</P>
<P>As to his Per&s;on he was but de&s;picable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character.</NOTE> being very crooked, tho' I
have heard from him&s;elf, and others, that he was &s;trait till about 16
Years of Age when he fir&s;t grew awry, by frequent practicing,
turning with a Turn-Lath, and the like incurvating Exerci&s;es, being
but of a thin weak habit of Body, which increas'd as he grew older,
&s;o as to be very remarkable at la&s;t: This made him but low of Sta|ture,
<PB N="xxvii" REF="33">
tho' by his Limbs he &s;hou'd have been moderately tall. He
was always very pale and $lean, and laterly nothing but Skin and
Bone, with a meagre A&s;pect, his Eyes grey and full, with a &s;harp
ingenious Look whil&s;t younger; his No&s;e but thin, of a moderate
height and length; his Mouth meanly wide, and upper Lip thin;
his Chin &s;harp, and Forehead large; his Head of a middle &s;ize.
He wore his own Hair of a dark Brown colour, very long and hang|ing
neglected over his Face uncut and lank, which about three Year
before his Death he cut off, and wore a Periwig. He went &s;toop|ing
and very fa&s;t (till his weakne&s;s a few Years before his Death hin|dred
him) having but a light Body to carry, and a great deal of Spirits and Activity, e&s;pecially in his Youth.</P>
<P>He was of an active, re&s;tle&s;s, indefatigable Genius even almo&s;t
to the la&s;t, and always &s;lept little to his Death, &s;eldom going to
Sleep till two three, or four a Clock in the Morning, and &s;eldomer
to Bed, oftener continuing his Studies all Night, and taking a &s;hort
Nap in the Day. His Temper was Melancholy, Mi&s;tru&s;tful and Jea|lous,
which more increas'd upon him with his Years. He was in the
beginning of his being made known to the Learned, very commu|nicative
of his Philo&s;ophical Di&s;coveries and Inventions, till &s;ome
Accidents made him to a Crime clo&s;e and re&s;erv'd. He laid the
cau&s;e upon &s;ome Per&s;ons, challenging his Di&s;coveries for their own,
taking occa&s;ion from his Hints to perfect what he had not; which
made him &s;ay he would &s;ugge&s;t nothing till he had time to perfect
it him&s;elf, which has been the Rea&s;on that many things are lo&s;t,
which he affirm'd he knew. He had a piercing Judgment into the
Di&s;po&s;itions of others, and would &s;ometimes give &s;hrewd Gue&s;&s;es
and smart Characters.</P>
<P>From his Youth he had been us'd to a Collegiate, or rather Mo|na&s;tick
Life, which might be &s;ome rea&s;on of his continuing to live
&s;o like an Hermit or Cynick too penuriou&s;ly, when his Circum&s;tan|ces,
as to E&s;tate, were very con&s;iderable, &s;carcely affording him|&s;elf

<P>I indeed, as well as others, have heard him declare &s;ometimes
that he had a great Project in his Head as to the di&s;po&s;al of the mo&s;t
part of his E&s;tate for the advancement of Natural Knowledge, and
to promote the Ends and De&s;igns for which the ROYAL SOCIETY
was in&s;tituted: To build an hand&s;ome Fabrick for the <HI>Societies</HI> u&s;e,
with a Library, Re&s;po&s;itary, Laboratory, and other Conveniencies
for making Experiments, and to found and endow a perpetual <HI>Phy|&s;ico-Mechanick
Lecture</HI> of the Nature of what him&s;elf read. But tho'
he was often &s;olicited by his Friends to put his De&s;igns down in Writ|ing,
and make his Will as to the di&s;po&s;al of his E&s;tate to his own
liking in the time of his Health; and after when him&s;elf, and all
thought, his End drew near, yet he could never be prevail'd with
to perfect it, &s;till procra&s;tinating it, till at la&s;t this great De&s;ign
prov'd an airy Phantom and vani&s;h'd into nothing. Thus he dy'd
at la&s;t without any Will and Te&s;tament that could be found. It is
ndeed but a melancholy Reflexion, that while &s;o many rich and
great Men leave con&s;iderable Sums for founding Ho&s;pitals, and the
the like pious U&s;es, few &s;ince Sir <HI>Thomas Gre&s;ham</HI> &s;hould do any thing
of this kind for the promoting of Learning, which no doubt would
be as much for the Good of the Nation, and Glory of God, as the
other of releiving the Poor.</P>

He always expre&s;t a great Veneration for the eternal and im|men&s;e
Cau&s;e of all Beings, as may be &s;een in very many Pa&s;&s;ages in
his Writings, and &s;eldom receiv'd any remarkable Benefit from
God without thankfully ackowledging the Mercy; never made a|ny
con&s;iderable di&s;covery in Nature, invented any u&s;eful Contri|vance,
or found out any difficult Problem, without &s;etting down
his Acknowledgement to the Omnipotent Providence, as many places

thus, DOMGM. and was a frequent &s;tudier of the Holy Scri|pture
in the Originals: If he was particular in &s;ome Matters, let
us leave him to the &s;earcher of Hearts.</P>
<P>To conclude, all his Errors and Blemi&s;hes were more than made
amends for, by the Greatne&s;s and Extent of his natural and acqui|red
Parts, and more than common, if not wonderful Sagacity, in
diving into the mo&s;t hidden Secrets of Nature, and in contriving
proper Methods of forcing her to confe&s;s the Truth, by driving
and pur&s;uing the <HI>Proteus</HI> thro' all her Changes, to her la&s;t and ut|mo&s;t

<P>There needs no other Proof for this than the great number of
Experiments he made, with the Contrivances for them, amounting
to &s;ome hundreds; his new and u&s;eful In&s;truments and Inventions,
which were numerous, his admirable Facility and Clearne&s;s, in ex|plaining

his happy Talent in adapting Theories to the Phaenomena ob|&s;erv'd,
and contriving ea&s;y and plain, not pompous and amu&s;ing
Experiments to back and prove tho&s;e Theories; proceeding from Ob|&s;ervations
to Theories, and from Theories to farther trials, which

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Pre&s;ent State of Natural Philo&s;ophy,
and wherein it is deficient.</HEAD>
<P>THE Bu&s;ine&s;s of Philo&s;ophy is to find out a perfect Knowledge
of the Nature and Proprieties of Bodies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First Generals</NOTE> and of the Cau&s;es of
Natural Productions, and this Knowledge is not barely acquir'd
for it &s;elf, but in order to the inabling a Man to under&s;tand how
by the joyning of fit Agents to Patients according to the Orders,
Laws, Times and Methods of Nature, he may be able to produce and bring to
pa&s;s &s;uch Effects, as may very much conduce to his well being in this World,
both for <HI>&s;atisfying his De&s;ires,</HI> and the relieving of his <HI>Nece&s;&s;ities:</HI> And for ad|vancing
his State above the common Condition of Men, and make him able to
excel them as much, almo&s;t, as they do Brutes or Ideots.</P>
<P>Now though there have been many Men, in divers Ages of the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Pre&s;ent State of</HI> Na|tural Philo&s;o|phy.</NOTE> which
&s;eem to have had &s;ome confus'd and imperfect Conception of this Idea of the
Bu&s;ine&s;s of Philo&s;ophy, and accordingly &s;eem to have had &s;ome Aims and De|&s;igns
towards the attaining of their propos'd end; yet having not a right Un|der&s;tanding
of the chief end, and failing much more in the Knowledge of the
Means, or the manner of making u&s;e of them, they have generally left Philo|&s;ophical
Knowledge almo&s;t in the Condition they found it: Without making any
con&s;iderable Increa&s;e or Addition to it. Whence this kind of Knowledge
has been very little promoted ever &s;ince the very fir&s;t times we have had any
Hi&s;tory of it. And though is has always made a fair &s;hew of flouri&s;hing; yet
upon Examination, it has been found to yield Leaves in&s;tead of &s;olid Fruit, to
be a Knowledge very confus'd and imperfect, and very in&s;ignificant as to the
inabling a Man to practi&s;e or operate by it.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to have proceeded from divers Cau&s;es, as</P>
<P>First, from the Unskilfulne&s;s of the Inventors and Founders of it, who &s;eem
to have many ways contributed thereto.</P>
<P>1. Fir&s;t in that they had not a true Idea of the De&s;ign and thing it &s;elf,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Rea&s;ons of the Deficiency of</HI> Natural Phi|lo&s;ophy.</NOTE> their
Aims were low and mean, and reacht but at &s;mall things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. From the first Inv$ntor$ 3 Way$.</NOTE> &s;uch as the giving the
Explication of things in hard words, which might &s;erve to amu&s;e their Auditors,
and to rai&s;e &s;ome E&s;teem of them&s;elves among&s;t them, &s;carce ever thinking,
much le&s;s indeavouring to find out the true Nature and Proprieties of Bodies;
what the inward Texture and Con&s;titution of them is, and what the Internal
Motions, Powers and Energies are, and how they may be made u&s;e of for produ|cing
&s;uch Changes and Transformations of Bodies from one thing to another as
is desired.</P>
<P>2. Next in that they were as ignorant of the true <HI>means</HI> of attaining it, as
they were of the Knowledge of the End. Some e&s;teem indeed we find them to
have had of <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory,</HI> and &s;ome Imagination they had that it was con|ducive
to Natural Knowledge, but what Hi&s;tory was requi&s;ite, they neither
had, or indeed &s;o much as knew, for what we find in <HI>Ari&s;totle, Pliny,</HI> and
others called by that Name, is &s;o uncertain and &s;uperficial, taking notice only of
&s;ome &s;light and obvious things, and tho&s;e &s;o unaccurately, as makes them &s;ignify
but little; but as for the more &s;ubtile Examinations of Natural Bodies, by
Di&s;&s;ections, Experiments, or Mechanical Tryals, we find them not to mention
them as needful, much le&s;s to have practi&s;ed them. Nor can I perceive that
they had any Affection or Indu&s;try for Experiments, much le&s;s for &s;uch as ought
to be vigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted with Care and Judgment: Nor do they &s;eem to
have had that Strictne&s;s and Accuratene&s;s as is requi&s;ite in &s;etting down or re|gi&s;tring
tho&s;e things which their Writings contain, but good and indifferent
<PB N="4" REF="38">
and &s;tark naught are without Di&s;tinction mixt together, true and probable and
fal&s;e are all alike dignified, nor are they &s;o accurate in their De&s;criptions, even
of not common things that they help us with; but a great part of them we find
to be a needle&s;s in&s;i&s;ting upou the outward Shape and Figure, or Beauty, and
the like, or el&s;e of &s;ome Magical and Super&s;titious Effects Producible by it &s;eem|ing
to aim at creating Plea&s;ure, and Diverti&s;ement or Admiration and Wonder,
and not of &s;uch a Knowledge of Bodies as might tend to Practice.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> In that, as they knew not the means, &s;o neither did they the
<HI>manner</HI> of making u&s;e of them, in which Particular we may find them to be
much more to &s;eek than in knowing what Materials were requi&s;ite. Their Me|thod
herein indeed was mo&s;t prepo&s;terous and very pernicious, for fir&s;t we find
them much inclin'd to a Belief of implanted Notions, at lea&s;t in their Practice,
though &s;ome of them affirm, <HI>Nihil e&s;&s;e in intellectu quod non fuit prius in &s;en&s;u,</HI>
yet upon the whole, we may find that in their manner of proceeding they did
quite otherwi&s;e. From a very few uncertain Hi&s;tories they u&s;ually rais'd the
mo&s;t general Deductions, and from them though never &s;o imperfect, would
needs pre&s;cribe Laws to the Univer&s;e and Nature it &s;elf. In this they were ve|ry
&s;upercilious, and very angry to be contradicted, and maintained their Opi|nions
more becau&s;e they had a&s;&s;erted them, than because they were true, they
&s;tudied more to gain Applau&s;e and make them&s;elves admired, or the Head of
&s;ome Sect, or the Author of &s;ome &s;trange Opinion, or the Oppo&s;er of &s;ome one
already famous Doctrine, or the like, than to perfect their Knowledge, or to
di&s;cern the Secrets of Nature, or advance the active Power of Man over the
Creatures. Nor was this all; but we may find them even to wre&s;t tho&s;e few
Experiments and Ob&s;ervations they had read, or collected, and to endeavour
rather to adapt them to their Hypothe&s;is, than to regulate their Thoughts by
them, e&s;teeming their own Under&s;tandings to be the Mine of all Science, and
that by pertinacious ruminating, they could thence produce the true Image and
Picture of the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor was this the only ill Fortune of true Science, but there is &s;omewhat more
behind. A Second Rea&s;on therefore why Philo&s;ophy has not increa&s;ed is to be
a&s;cribed to the Sectators of the&s;e Theories,<NOTE PLACE="marg">II. From the Sectators from &s;everal Cau&s;es.</NOTE> who at be&s;t have not improv'd it to
a nearer Approach to Truth, but have rather made it wor&s;e than bettet, and
more ob&s;cure by Interpretation. The Rea&s;on of which &s;eems to be from the&s;e
Particulars.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1">From their manner of In&s;titution, being bred up with a Prejudice again&s;t the
&s;earch of Truth el&s;ewhere, than in Books thereby chained up by the imbib'd
Principles and Dictates of their Teachers, and their Minds habituated to a loath|ing
of any thing that offered it &s;elf as a Novelty or new Di&s;covery, and upon
that account whether true or fal&s;e rejected. This proceeded partly in the 2d.
Place.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2">From an Imagination they have that Arts are already come to their highe&s;t
pitch of Perfection, and that therefore 'tis in vain to endeavour to find out that
by the mo&s;t difficult way, which might be obtained more ea&s;ily and fully
out of Books.</P>
<P>This Aver&s;ion al&s;o to Inquiries and New Di&s;coveries proceeded partly al&s;o
in the 3d. Place.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3">From a too great Reverence and E&s;teem for the Writings of the Ancients, as
&s;uppo&s;ing tho&s;e to be the greate&s;t Men for Wi&s;dom and Knowledge, and tho&s;e
Ages wherein they liv'd to be the elder Times of the World; and therefore they
accounted it a great piece of Folly, and a kind of Impiety to contradict, or endea|vour
to be wi&s;er than their Fore-fathers.</P>
<P>Hence proceeded a <HI>Fourth</HI> Impediment, namely,</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4">From their following the &s;ame Way and Method in illu&s;trating or endea|vouring
to under&s;tand their Writings, that the Authors them&s;elves did in com|po&s;ing
them: And therefore 'tis not to be expected that Water &s;hould ri&s;e high|er
than the Fountain Head from whence it came; or that greater and more nota|ble
Effects &s;hould be produced by any other than an extrarodinary Method. For
the Logick or way of Ratiocination they have made u&s;e of, hath been rather an
Hindrance than a Furtherance. For neither is the way of <HI>Syllogi&s;ing</HI> as it ought
<PB N="5" REF="39">
nor are their fir&s;t <HI>Notions</HI> &s;tated aright, and
con&s;equently their Axioms and Conclu&s;ions cannot be better than the Grounds and Principles from which they
were rais'd; &s;o that it does not only not promote real Knowledge, but is inju|rious
to it, by begetting an Opinion of Science where there is no &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>5<HI>ly,</HI> From their mi&s;taken Aim or Scope, which is an indeavour by Nice Di&s;tin|ctions<MILESTONE N="5">
to wre&s;t over all the Ob&s;ervations they chance to &s;tumble upon, and
make them corre&s;pondent with their already believ'd Theory; in&s;tead of an in|deavour
to rectify and regulate tho&s;e &s;o receiv'd Theories by tho&s;e Intimations,
which careful and accurate Ob&s;ervations would afford.</P>
<P>6<HI>ly,</HI> Such as have a little varied from the receiv'd Opinions, the Alteration has<MILESTONE N="6">
been rather for the bringing in &s;ome one New Hypothe&s;is or Opinion of their
own in&s;tead of the Old, and not for the renewing or Amending the whole.</P>
<P>7<HI>ly,</HI> And &s;ome that have indeavoured to make u&s;e of Arguments rais'd from the<MILESTONE N="7">
Experiments, and Ob&s;ervations, have been &s;o confounded with them, for want
of a Method of proceeding; that it has been to little purpo&s;e, &s;ave the putting of Men upon new Tryals, whereby perhaps &s;ome u&s;eful Experiment has been
light on, and thereby &s;ome latent Error in the former Theories detected. For
neither having a true Idea of making Ob&s;ervations and Experiments, nor a con|venient
way of ordering, nor a right Method of u&s;ing them, the greater num|ber
of them they have, the more are they confounded; for 'tis not the Multi|tude
of Experiments nor the Excellency of them, nor is it indeed the &s;ubtile
and curious Ratiocinations of an accompli&s;ht Mind, nor the Endeavours of a
Multitude of &s;uch joyned together, that will be able to do any great matter in
this De&s;ign; for &s;uch Endeavours do at be&s;t but rai&s;e new Probabilities, and
con&s;equently augment Di&s;putes on the one hand, and new Tryals on the other,
and all to as little purpo&s;e as 'twould be to attempt to find &s;ome extreamly
difficult Geometrical Problem by the Ruler and Compa&s;s, without the Know|ledge
or Help of Geometrical Algebra.</P>
<P>For where the Examination and Compari&s;on of &s;o great a Number of Parti|culars
is requi&s;ite, and where the Proce&s;s is long, and the Informations but thinly
&s;catter'd, and tho&s;e al&s;o in the Dark, 'tis not to be expected from the mo&s;t
&s;ubtile Wit, that the whole Operation &s;hould be only performed by the Strength
of its Memory, and the Activity of its Ratiocination, though each of them in the
greate&s;t pitch of Perfection; much le&s;s can it be hoped from Endeavours, that
want either of the&s;e Accompli&s;hments. And how u&s;ual 'tis for one of the&s;e to
be defective where&punc; the other prevails, may be &s;ufficiently evident from the al|mo&s;t
Proverbial Saying, that good Wits have ill Memories. Some things
indeed have been by lucky Inquirers light on by chance, but tho&s;e &s;o few and
&s;eldom, that 'twas not ab&s;urd in <HI>Pythagoras</HI> to offer up a <HI>Hecatomb</HI> for a &s;ingle
Invention in Geometry. I do not here with the Scepticks affirm, that nothing
is or can be known, my De&s;ign is quite another thing; their end only in deny|ing
any thing to be knowable, &s;eems to be Di&s;pute, and tends to Ignorance and
Laziness, mine on the other &s;ide &s;uppo&s;es all things as po$$ible to be known,
and accordingly &s;tudies and con&s;iders of the Means that &s;eem to tend to that end,
and rou&s;es up the deceiv'd Faculties to &s;eek a Means of recovering them&s;elves
out of their Thraldom, and of improving, rectifying and inlarging their Powers.
They affirm po&s;itively nothing can be known any way, I only that many more
things may be di&s;cover'd by this Method I here propound, than are already
known.</P>
<P>Nor is the State of Philo&s;ophy as yet very much improved by our Modern
Writers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">III. Philo&s;ophy hitherto not much improved by the Mo|derns, and the Rea&s;ons why.</NOTE> who have endeavour'd to illu&s;trate or piece up the old, by adding
&s;ome Placits of their own: There are yet many Impediments to be removed,
and many Helps to be &s;upplied before any very great Increa&s;e in Knowledge is
to be expected. It may be que&s;tioned whether piecing or mending will &s;erve
the turn, or whether there mu&s;t not be a new Foundation laid on the Informa|tions
of our Sen&s;es, and more &s;trictly examined and &s;urveyed by accurate and
judicious Experiments and Ob&s;ervations. That which hath had the Cultivation
of many Hundreds of Years, and by divers very acute Men in all Ages, and
yet as to the Inquiry after the Cau&s;es of Natural Efficients, has made &s;o little,
if any Progre&s;s at all, cannot with any Probability be imagined to afford a Me|thod
&s;ufficient for this Inquiry. I do not here altogether reject <HI>Logick,</HI> of the
<PB N="6" REF="40">
way of Ratiocination already known; as a thing of no u&s;e. It has its pecu|liar
Excellencies and U&s;es, in ordinary Di&s;cour&s;e and Conver&s;ation: And af|fords
&s;ome Helps to &s;ome kinds of Invention, e&s;pecially of Arguments&punc; as well
as to the Memory, by its Method: It affords copious Matter for Di&s;putes as
well for, as again&s;t the Truth, and teaches how to &s;olve, as well as how to
make a fallacious A&s;&s;ertion. It &s;hews how the Modes of &s;peaking and argu|ing
may be reduced to certain Rules, and how each compleat Sentence may be
tri&s;ected into its con&s;tituent Parts, and how tho&s;e may be various ways &s;huffl'd
and chang'd, and likewi&s;e on occa&s;ion al&s;o how each of the&s;e bigger may be di|vided
into three le&s;s. But as to the Inquiry into Natural Operations, what are
the Kinds of &s;ecret and &s;ubtile Actors, and what the ab&s;tru&s;e and hidden In&s;tru|ments
and Engines there made u&s;e of, may be; It &s;eems not, to me, as yet at
all adapted and wholly deficient. For 'tis not to be expected from the Accom|pli&s;hments
the Creator has endowed Man withal, that he &s;hould be able to leap,
from a few particular Informations of his Sen&s;es, and tho&s;e very &s;uper|ficial
at be&s;t, and for the mo&s;t part fallacious, to the general Knowledge of
Univer&s;als or ab&s;tracted Natures, and thence be able, as out of an inexhau&s;table
Fountain, to draw out a perfect Knowledge of all Particulars, to deduce the
Cau&s;es of all Effects and Actions from this or that Axiome or Sentence, and as
it were intuitively, to know what Nature does or is capable of effecting: And
after what manner and Method &s;he works; and yet that Method &s;uppo&s;es little
le&s;s: Man's Memory &s;eems very &s;hallow and infirm, and &s;o is very prone to
forget many Circum&s;tances, be&s;ides it cannot &s;o well propound all it does re|member,
to be examin'd at once by the Judgment; but prefers &s;ome things fir&s;t
in order, before others, and &s;ome things with more Vehemence and greater con|cern,
and accordingly the Under&s;tanding is more apt to be &s;way'd to this or
that hand, according as it is more affected or pre&s;t by this or that In&s;tance,
and is very liable to over&s;ee &s;ome con&s;iderable Pa&s;&s;ages, or to neglect them; and thence very apt to be &s;educ'd, in pronouncing po&s;itively for this or that
Opinion, e&s;pecially being very prone to run into the affirmative way of judging,
and wanting Patience to follow and pro&s;ecute the negative way of Inquiry, by
Rejection of Di&s;agreeing Natures.</P>
<P>Farther, a great Cau&s;e why Philo&s;ophy has not formerly or of late increa&s;ed,
is becau&s;e the greate&s;t part of Learned Men have applied them&s;elves to other
Studies, Divinity, Law, Phy&s;ick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as being tho&s;e &s;tanding Profe&s;&s;ions where|by
Men of the mo&s;t liberal and ingenuous Education and Spirit might provide
for them&s;elves, and promote their Fortune in the World: Taking only a tran|&s;ient
View of Natural Philo&s;ophy, in their Pa&s;&s;age to other things, thinking it
&s;ufficient to be able to talk of it in the Phra&s;e of the School. Nor is it only &s;o
now, but it has been &s;o almo&s;t in all Ages, &s;o that for about two Thou&s;and
Years, of which we have &s;ome accoun$ in Hi&s;tory, there is not above one quar|ter
of that &s;pace wherein Men have been Philo&s;ophically given, and among
&s;uch as have been &s;o, &s;everal of them have been &s;o far disjoined by Time, Lan|guage,
and Climate, by manner of Education, Manners, Opinions, and divers
other Prejudices, that it could not be expected it &s;hould make any con&s;iderable
Progre&s;s: For either becau&s;e it &s;eemed to promi&s;e little, Men for the mo&s;t part
have neglected it, or in tho&s;e &s;hort &s;paces of time in which it was &s;omewhat
more minded and look'd after, what from the want of Dowry belonging to
other liberal Profe&s;&s;ions, what from the Conte&s;ts of &s;evetal Theori&s;ts, and the
Defect of applying of it to &s;uch things as might be u&s;eful to Humane Life;
Men have been either di&s;couraged from the Study, or tired our in it.</P>
<P>Some other Cour&s;e therefore mu&s;t be taken to promote the Search of Know|ledge.
Some other kind of Art for Inquiry than what hath been hitherto made
u&s;e of, mu&s;t be di&s;covered; the Intellect is not to be &s;uffer'd to act without its
Helps, but is continually to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome Method or Engine, which &s;hall
be as a Guide to regulate its Actions, &s;o as that it &s;hall not be able to act ami&s;s:
Of this Engine, no Man except the incomparable <HI>Verulam,</HI> hath had any
Thoughts, and he indeed hath promoted it to a very good pitch; but there is
yet &s;omewhat more to be added, which he &s;eem'd to want time to compleat.
By this, as by that Art of <HI>Algebra</HI> in Geometry, $twill be very ea&s;y to pro|ceed
in any Natural Inquiry, regularly and certainly: And indeed it may not
<PB N="7" REF="41">
improperly be call'd a Philo&s;ophical Algebra, or an Art of directing the Mind
in the &s;earch after Philo&s;ophical Truths, for as 'tis very hard for the mo&s;t acute
Wit to find out any difficult Problem in Geometry, without the help of <HI>Algebra</HI>
to direct and regulate the Acts of the Rea&s;on in the Proce&s;s from the Que&s;tion
to the <HI>quae&s;itum,</HI> and altogether as ea&s;y for the meane&s;t Capacity acting by that
Method to compleat and perfect it, &s;o will it be in the Inquiry after Natural
Knowledge.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t and mo&s;t accompli&s;ht Wits for the&s;e many Ages have labour'd
and &s;weat in the&s;e Inquiries, and yet they have not been able to bring forth any
greater Effects than Probabilities: Whereas I cannot doubt but that if this Art
be well pro&s;ecuted and made u&s;e of, an ordinary Capacity with Indu&s;try, will
be able to do very much more than has yet been done, and to &s;hew that even
Phy&s;ical and Natural Enquiries as well as Mathematical and Geometrical, will
be capable al&s;o of Demon&s;tration &s;o that henceforward the bu&s;ine&s;s of Inven|tion
will not be &s;o much the Effect of acute Wit, as of a &s;erious and indu&s;trious
Pro&s;ecution: And therefore, I hope as I &s;hall not &s;eem to detract from the
Parts and Excellency of the Ancients, but rather to admire and magnify their
Wit and Indu&s;try that they were able to proceed &s;o far as they did, without the
Help of this Method, &s;o I hope I &s;hall not be look'd on as vain or boa&s;ting, or
extolling of the pre&s;ent Abilities of this Age, if by the Pro&s;ecution of this Me|thod
I expect and a&s;&s;ert a much greater Proficiency. And this Art we owe fir&s;t
and chiefly to that excellent Per&s;on I now mention'd, who was able to over|come
all the Difficulties of Prejudice, with which Mens Minds are u&s;ually be&s;et,
and to con&s;ider and weigh the Nature of things &s;o far, as not only to di&s;cover the
Impediments of Learning, but to contrive a Method how to free the Mind from
them; and likewi&s;e to fortify and inrich it with &s;uch a Method, as &s;hall be a
con&s;tant Guide and A&s;&s;i&s;tant to regulate all its Motions, &s;o that by the u&s;e of
it, it may be able to go through with its Undertaking, and as with an Engine
to perform incomparably much more than 'tis po&s;&s;ible to do without that
A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

with &s;uch Organs as are capable of taking Information of the Operations of Na|ture,
only by &s;ome few peculiar ways of Sen&s;ation: Man is not indued with an
intuitive Faculty, to &s;ee farther into the Nature of things at fir&s;t, than the Su|perficies
and out-&s;ides, and &s;o mu&s;t go a long way about before he can be able
to behold the Internal Nature of things, and in this Progre&s;s there is very
great Danger of his mi&s;carrying;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t. Cau&s;e of Prejudice from our own Na|ture.</NOTE> for endeavouring to make u&s;e of the Informa|tions
Sen&s;e, for that end, there are &s;o many ways of mi&s;taking, that mo&s;t
have fallen into them: Some have fallen pre&s;ently upon ab&s;tracted Notions, and
flown immediately from a very few particular Sen&s;ations to the mo&s;t General
and Univer&s;al Conclu&s;ions and Theories, others on the other &s;ide have been &s;o
amazed and confounded with Particulars, that they have only proceeded, gro|ping
on after other Particulars, thinking at la&s;t they may by chance light upon
&s;omething that may afford them Information in what they look after: Some
others have endeavoured to intermix both the&s;e together, but with &s;o very ill
Succe&s;s, that they have left but little Fruit of their Endeavours.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t De&s;ign indeed of the Organs of Sen&s;e, &s;eems to have been for
&s;ome other U&s;e than for the acquiring of this kind of Knowledge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief De|&s;ign of the Sen&s;es.</NOTE> and to have
a very great Affinity with the Sen&s;es of other Animals; which &s;eem to have
been made purpo&s;ely for the peculiar U&s;e of each &s;everal Species: The Sight
for di&s;covering Conveniences and Inconveniences at a greater Di&s;tance as well
as near at hand: The Ear, for receiving Warning or Information from Sound,
where the Eye could not a&s;&s;i&s;t: The No&s;e, for di&s;tingui&s;hing by the Effluvia of
Bodies, of whol&s;ome or unwhol&s;ome Nouri&s;hment: The Ta&s;te for the &s;ame
purpo&s;e, by the Di&s;&s;olution of them in the Mouth, and for the determining of
the Quantity requi&s;ite to be taken at a time. The Feeling, for the Sen&s;ation of
External Textures or Motions. But yet the greater Perfection of Ratiocination
in Man, may make them capable of other kind of Informations: Though in|deed
of them&s;elves they afford little as to what we are looking after. The Ap|prehen&s;ion
al&s;o or common Sen&s;e is not of the Nature of the things &s;o &s;en&s;ated,
but only with &s;ome peculiar Reference to our own Structure. Thus &s;ome Ta&s;tes
are &s;weet or &s;owre to us, which I make a great doubt whether they are &s;o to
the Sen&s;es of other Creatures: And tho&s;e things &s;eem plea&s;ant in the Smell to
other Creatures Sen&s;es, which to our Sen&s;es &s;eem quite otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>So that our Apprehen&s;ions of things &s;eem to be appropriated to our Species:
And that if there were another Species of Intelligent Creatures in the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Apprehen|&s;ions appropri|ated to our Species.</NOTE> they
might have quite another kind of Apprehen&s;ion of the &s;ame thing, and neither
perhaps &s;uch as they ought to be, and each of them adapted to the peculiar
Structure of that Animal Body in which the Sen&s;ation is made. Thus we, by
having our Organ of Hearing moved by a certain Motion of the Air, cau&s;ed by
a quick Vibration of &s;ome &s;olid Body, have a peculiar Conception of Sound;
not to be expre&s;t to a deaf Man, or one that has not the &s;ame kind of Organ or
manner of Apprehen&s;ion. We do not &s;o conceive of it as of a Notion in the
Sonorous Body, but as of a Quality which we know not how to expre&s;s our
Conception of, but as of &s;omething that does plea&s;ingly affect our Hearing, and
we call that Conception we have of it Sound. But if we ob&s;erve that Propriety
in the &s;ounding Body by the Eye, we have there quite another Idea of it impre&s;t
on our Phantcy, and nothing at all of the Imagination of Sound, but only of a
<PB N="9" REF="43">
Body in a Vibrative Motion. And if we &s;en&s;ate that Propriety in the Vibra|ting
Body by our Feeling, we have quite a differing Idea of the &s;ame Propriety,
and there we have an Imagination of it, which we call tingling or tickling, or
Heat: From which it &s;eems evident, that tho&s;e Imaginations we have of things,
are not according to the Nature of the things them&s;elves; but only appropria|ted
to the peculiar Organs, by which they are made &s;en&s;ible to the Under&s;tand|ing.
So that had we other kinds of Organs, we &s;hould have other kinds of
Conceptions of tho&s;e Effects. And tho&s;e perhaps we have may be quite differ|ing
from what other Creatures have of the &s;ame thing. Thus that Con&s;titu|tion
of Air, which we call dark, is not &s;o to Cats and Owls, and the like;
nor is it &s;o indeed to a Man if his Eyes are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome peculiar kind of In|&s;truments,
as I have divers times found by Experiment, wherein I have been
able to &s;ee to read the Letters and Words di&s;tinct in &s;uch a Light, wherein,
without that help, I have hardly been able to &s;ee the Lines. Thus Heat and
Cold are only Relative to our Con&s;titution, as is evident by the Weather Gla&s;s,
which feels many Degrees of Heat before it be &s;en&s;ible to us.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Remedy therefore that &s;eems to be again&s;t this Prejudice is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remedy for the&s;e Preju|dices from the Sen&s;es.</NOTE> to com|pare
the &s;everal Informations we receive of the &s;ame thing, from the &s;everal Im|pre&s;&s;ions
it makes on the &s;everal Organs of Sen&s;e and (by a Rejection of what
is not con&s;onant) by degrees to find out its Nature, and thereby to inform the
Intellect with a Notion of the thing; which is not according to this or that
Idea, rais'd from the Impre&s;&s;ion of this or that Sen&s;e, but by a comparative
Act of the Under&s;tanding from all the various Informations 'tis capable of re|ceiving,
more immediately by any of the Sen&s;es, or more mediately by various
other Ob&s;ervations or Experiments.</P>
<P>We ought to conceive of things as they are part of, and Actors or Patients
in the Univer&s;e, and not only as they have this or that peculiar Relation or In|fluence
on our own Sen&s;es or &s;elves. And for this cau&s;e we ought to be very
careful in what Sen&s;e we under&s;tand Philo&s;ophical Words already in u&s;e, for
the&s;e having been for the mo&s;t part made by &s;uch as had tho&s;e Prejudices re|maining
on them, and we al&s;o having fir&s;t received in or imbibed the Sen&s;es of
tho&s;e words, whil&s;t under the like Prejudices: It cannot be expected but that
the Notions mu&s;t be very confu&s;ed and incon&s;i&s;tent with the things them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Another Cau&s;e of Prejudice is from every Man's own peculiar Structure:
Every Man has born with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d. Cau&s;e of Prejudice from the peculiar Structure of every Man, or particular bent of his Studies.</NOTE> or contracted by &s;ome way or other, a Con&s;ti|tution
of Body and Mind, that does more or le&s;s di&s;po&s;e him to this or that kind
of Imagination or Phant'&s;y of things, and every one has &s;ome kind of
Accident or other, that does more or le&s;s di&s;po&s;e him for this Opinion or
that Operation of the Mind as well as of the Body. Thus &s;ome kind of Con|&s;titutions
of Body does more incline a Man to Contemplation, and Speculation, another to Operation,
Examination, and making Experiments, and look what
way the Con&s;titution of a Man, or &s;ome other Accident has inclin'd him to, that
way almo&s;t are bent all his other Faculties and Powers. Thus one is for &s;peak|ing,
and another for Writing, and all things are look'd on, or di&s;regarded by
&s;uch, as they are &s;ub&s;ervient to &s;uch an end: And not only many things, not
very in&s;tructive, are let pa&s;s; but &s;ometimes al&s;o many things that have no
&s;uch Indication in them, are brought in as 'twere by the Head and Shoulders,
and wre&s;ted, to be made compliable to this or that Opinion. Ju&s;t as a Man that
is troubled with the Jaundice, &s;uppo&s;es all things to be Yellow, and all things
he eats, till otherwi&s;e prevented, &s;erve to augment his Choler, by being chang'd
into it: Or a melancholy Per&s;on, that thinks he meets with nothing but fright|ful
Apparitions, does convert all things he either &s;ees or hears into dreadful
Repre&s;entations, and makes u&s;e of them to &s;trengthen his Phant'&s;y, and fill it
fuller of &s;uch unea&s;y Apprehen&s;ious, &s;o is it in Con&s;titutions of Mind as to
Philo&s;ophy. Thus <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Phy&s;ick is very much influenced by his Logick:
<HI>Des Cartes</HI> Philo&s;ophy &s;avours much of his Opticks: <HI>Van Helmonts,</HI> and the
re&s;t of the Chymi&s;ts of their Chimical Operations: <HI>Gilberts</HI> of the Load&s;tone:
<HI>Pythagoras</HI>'s and <HI>Jordanus Brunus</HI>'s, <HI>Kepler</HI>'s, &amp;c. of Arithmetick and the Harmony
of Numbers. The Philo&s;ophy, of &s;ome Divines, is intermingled with Divinity;
of others, with Spirits and immaterial Agents: A&s;trologers endeavour to bring
<PB N="10" REF="44">
all things under the Power and Influence of Caele&s;tial Bodies, and would have
them the chief Efficients of the World, and indeed every one according to the
things he mo&s;t fancies naturally, or has accidentally &s;tudied, and is mo&s;t con|ver&s;ant
in, endeavours to make all things he meets with, agreeable or &s;ub&s;er|vient
thereto. And he is much the more inclin'd to maintain and defend this or
that Opinion, if he has once any way publickly owned it, whether in Writing
or Di&s;cour&s;e, &s;o far too perhaps &s;ometimes, that though at fir&s;t he defended it
when he thought otherwi&s;e, yet by continuing to do &s;o for the maintaining of
an Argument, or of his Credit, he at la&s;t comes to believe it, and the Fallacy,
which he endeavoured to put upon others, impo&s;es mo&s;t of all upon him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Remedy again&s;t this Inconvenience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Remedies again&s;t this.</NOTE> is the finding out of what Con|&s;titution
ones &s;elf is, and to what one is either naturally or accidentally mo&s;t
inclin'd to believe, and accordingly by rea&s;oning and comparing things together
to con&s;ider what the things them&s;elves hint, and what Intimation proceeds from
ones own Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Next, to accu&s;tom ones &s;elf as much as can be for a while at lea&s;t, to a quite
contrary Suppo&s;al or Practice: Or which is indeed more general, not to receive
any Notion for certain, till throughly confirm'd by very Cogent Arguments and
Ratiocinations, and always mo&s;t to &s;u&s;pect that which &s;eems mo&s;t con&s;onant
and plea&s;ing to our Inclination: Thus one, that fancies Novelty, &s;hould be mo&s;t
cautious of what he admits for Truth or Demon&s;tration that is new; le$t his
Mind being prejudiced with a Love of Novelties, &s;hould otherwi&s;e impo&s;e up|on
his Belief and Under&s;tanding: Thus one that is addicted to Chymical or
Mechanical Operations, &s;hould be very cautious of admitting of a Chymical
or Mechanical Solution, and &s;o for the re&s;t; for that may &s;eem very probable
and rational to one, who&s;e Mind is &s;o inclin'd; which to one of another Con|&s;titution
will &s;eem mo&s;t unlikely and ab&s;urd: So one, inclin'd to Speculation
and ab&s;tracting, &s;hould bridle his Nature and not fly too &s;oon to the mo&s;t ge|ral
Conclu&s;ions, for as a Nature &s;o inclin'd does willingly oftentimes impo&s;e
upon it &s;elf, and longs to be acting, and running in its proper and mo&s;t known
Road, and avoids that Method it is not acquainted with, finding it very uncouth
and full of many new Difficulties. So though the rea&s;on &s;hould be &s;atisfied,
and the Phant'&s;y full of the Truth of this or that Opinion, another Mind other|wi&s;e
qualified, may find many Flaws and Errors in it, and perceive many things
to have proceeded from Prejudice.</P>
<P>A Third Cau&s;e of Prejudice is from Language,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A 3d. Cau&s;e of Prejudice from Education and the unaccurate u&s;e of words.</NOTE> Education, Breeding, Con|ver&s;ation,
In&s;truction, Study, from an E&s;teem of Authors, Tutors, Ma&s;ters, An|tiquity,
Novelty, Fa&s;hions, Cu&s;toms, or the like. The Philo&s;ophical words,
of all Languages yet known in the World, &s;eem to be for the mo&s;t part very
improper Marks, &s;et on confu&s;ed and complicated Notions, together with the
Learning of which Language we have imbibed tho&s;e confus'd Notions, which
are commonly under&s;tood by the mention of tho&s;e Words, the&s;e Words there|fore
being u&s;ed in our Di&s;cour&s;e, and tho&s;e Notions in our Ratiocinations,
mu&s;t needs very much perplex the Operations of the Mind, and much puzzle
and di&s;turb the Ratiocination. The Notions of the Mind therefore ought to
be &s;tated aright, and the Signification of many words ought to be more de|fin'd
divers new Words al&s;o to be made and &s;et upon more di&s;tinct Conceptions
and Notions, and many other words ought to be wholly blotted out and rejected,
as either &s;ignifying &s;omething imperfectly, which is otherwi&s;e better expre&s;t, or
el&s;e a Phanta&s;m, for which there is no ground in Nature: Education al&s;o, Breeding,
Conver&s;ation and In&s;truction, do all of them very much work upon the Affection,
and &s;erve to &s;way it this way or that way according to the Will of the Teacher,
whereby the Under&s;tanding becomes in&s;laved to the Dictates of Education, and
the Ratiocination bound up or fettered by the <HI>Placits</HI> of a Tutor, &s;o as not to
be able to lay hold of Truth though never &s;o fairly offer'd: For mo&s;t of tho&s;e
things being in&s;tilled into our Minds when young and tender, and incapacitated
to di&s;tingui&s;h between A&s;&s;ertions and Demon&s;trations, and between Opinions
and Realities, have taken &s;o deep a Root, and &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;t the Mind with Preju|dice
again&s;t many Ways and Methods of Truth, that they are not freed with|out
very much Trouble and Circum&s;petcion; and 'tis a kind of Soveraignty
<PB N="11" REF="45">
which Men do mo&s;t of all affect, to captivate and in&s;lave Mens Minds to a
Reverence or good Opinion of their Abilities, and Doctrines; &s;o that we have
not only a great many Enemies to Knowledge and Freedom, lodg'd within our
Brea&s;ts and Fabricks, but are every way encompa&s;&s;ed; and tho&s;e which &s;eem
our greate&s;t Friends, do in this regard prove our greate&s;t Enemies.</P>
<P>And this Bond is &s;o much the more difficult to be &s;haken off, if together with
their Doctrines we have entertain'd an Admiration, Awe, Reverence, or E&s;teem
of the Per&s;ons them&s;elves that in&s;tructed us, or were the Authors of the Books
or Opinions we have approv'd. Add to all the&s;e Multitudes of fal&s;e Opinions,
which have been impos'd upon our Belief by fallacious Demon&s;trations in Di&s;|cour&s;e
and Conver&s;ation: For Words being ill &s;et Marks on very confu&s;ed No|tions;
the Rea&s;on of a Man is very ea&s;ily impos'd on by Di&s;cour&s;e, unle&s;s the
Mind be extreamly attent, and watchful, not to take any thing for granted,
that is not evidently prov'd, and very per&s;picacious in finding out the di&s;tinct
Notion of the Word, in every &s;uch Sentence, wherein it is u&s;ed, for the No|tions
&s;ignified by, &s;ome words being very many and very perplex, unle&s;s that
Notion there meant be (by &s;ome Periphra&s;is or otherwi&s;e) determine'd to be al|ways
&s;ignified when that word is pronounced; the Circum&s;pection of the In|tellect
is &s;o &s;low in examining over Particulars, and running over all the parti|cular
Siginifications &s;ome words may have, that it may very ea&s;ily be impos'd
upon by a quick and cunning Di&s;putant, and being once impos'd on without
being detected, the Admi&s;&s;ion of that Error is the occa&s;ion of bringing in Mul|titudes
of others; Error being a kind of Ferment which tends to the turning or
conforming all things to its own Nature, and like an infected Per&s;on has Influ|ence
on all things it comes near.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Remedy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Remedy for the&s;e.</NOTE> for which Inconvenience, is not to con&s;ider &s;o much what
the Per&s;on is that in&s;tructs, as how true the things are he a&s;&s;erts, nor of what Au|thority
tho&s;e Authors are e&s;teem'd we read; but what Arguments are by them
brought for that which they a&s;&s;ert, and if we are &s;o over-born with Love, or
Reverence, to this or that Author, as to e&s;teem of whatever he &s;ays, whether
right or wrong, than to imagine what he &s;ays to be &s;poken by one <HI>again&s;t</HI> who&s;e
Per&s;on or Doctrine we have a Prejudice; for that will &s;omewhat incline the
Mind to a contrary Opinion, and thereby help to ballance the Inclination of it
the better, &s;o that it &s;hall not reject Truth when offer'd on the one hand, nor
embrace an Error when a&s;&s;erted by the other.</P>
<P>Another way is to con&s;ider with what Vehemence and Earne&s;tne&s;s two con|trary
Opinions are believed and a&s;&s;erted on both &s;ides, and to con&s;ider what are
or have been the occa&s;ions to incline the Parties to tho&s;e Opinions or Doctrines
they maintain, and as near as may be to di&s;tingui&s;h what manner of Actings
there are which proceed from Rea&s;on, and what from Prejudice, and from
thence to endeavour to fortify the Mind with Arguments again&s;t Dogmatical|ne&s;s
and Opinionativeue&s;s upon too &s;mall Grounds, and to accu&s;tom the Mind
to an Equilibrium or Indifferency, &s;o as to be &s;way'd and turn'd to the embra|cing
of Truth from whence or whom&s;oever brought.</P>
<P>A third way of remedying or rooting out Prejudices already impos'd on us,
and of preventing the like Impo&s;itions for the future; is an Hypothetical
Sceptici&s;m, whereby to impo&s;e upon our &s;elves a Disbelief of every thing
what&s;oever, that we have already imbraced or taken in as a Truth: And in &s;o
doing, to throw out not only tho&s;e things we may a little doubt of, but even all
tho&s;e things of which we are mo&s;t confident, and tho&s;e e&s;pecially which out
particular Con&s;titutions &s;eem mo&s;t of all to incline us to believe, rejecting them
all as Impo&s;tures and Fallacies, that have by &s;ome indirect means or other crept
into our Under&s;tandings, or have been impos'd upon our Minds by &s;ome or other

what In&s;truments will farther a&s;&s;i&s;t the Sen&s;es in this Inquiry, and how far al&s;o
their Power will extend, and by what means we may be farther a&s;&s;i&s;ted in this
Search.</P>
<P>The differing ways of Sen&s;ation we find to be Five, which are provided with
as may di&s;tinct Organs; the 1&s;t. and mo&s;t Spiritual is plac'd in the Eye, a 2d.
in the Ear, a 3d. in the No&s;e, a 4th. in the Mouth, the 5th. over the whole
Body.</P>
<P>The Fabrick of the Eye is mo&s;t admirably contrived for receiving in the Im|pre&s;&s;ion
of the Rays of Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sen&s;e of Seeing.</NOTE> and for &s;o dispo&s;ing and ordering of them, that
tho&s;e Rays that proceed from the several Points of any Object that either emits
or reflects Light, and fall on the Cornea of the Eye, &s;hall be all of them collected
into &s;o many di&s;tinct Points at the bottom of the Eye, and that in the &s;ame Or|der,
that the Points were &s;cituated in re&s;pect of the Eye, but in le&s;&s;er Propor|tion,
according as the Object is farther removed in di&s;tance from the Eye, and
in a greater Proportion as the Object is nearer; &s;o that the Picture or Repre|&s;entation
of the Object in the &s;en&s;ible part, or bottom of the Eye, may accord|ing
to Po&s;ture of Di&s;tance of it from the Cornea, be either le&s;s equal or
bigger than the Object it &s;elf: Whence were the Sen&s;e of di&s;tingui&s;hing the
Parts of the Picture at the bottom of the Eye, as nice and particular as the Bo|dy
has di&s;tinct Parts, we might very ea&s;ily by this Sen&s;e only find out the Tex|ture
or Schemati&s;m of any Body within our reach; for 'tis very ea&s;y by one
&s;ingle Lens of a &s;mall Sphere, or of a very Convex Figure, plac'd ju&s;t before
the Eye, to make the Object di&s;tinctly vi&s;ible, when much nearer to the Cornea
than the Cornea is to the bottom of the Eye, and con&s;equently the Rays cro&s;&s;ing
near the Cornea, the Picture or Repre&s;entation at the bottom mu&s;t be bigger
than the Object it &s;elf; but the di&s;cerning Power of the Sen&s;e is not capable of
making Di&s;tinction so Parts when they are &s;maller than &s;uch a Bulk, the Ter|minus
of which, I find to my Eye, to be when the Repre&s;entation is about the
Bigne&s;s of the &s;maller Pores to Wood: Which I find by this Expedient, by a
convenient &s;ingle Lens I bring the Object I look on &s;o near my Eye, that the
cro&s;&s;ing of Rays in the Eye may be about the middle Space between the vi&s;ible
&s;ide of the Object, and the bottom of my Eye; from whence it follows, that
the Picture of the vi&s;ible part of the Object is as big as the thing repre&s;ented:
But the Eye being then at mo&s;t but capable of &s;eeing or di&s;tingui&s;hing tho&s;e
Pores; it follows, that (if the Cau&s;e of that Di&s;tinction be from the ends of
the Filaments of Optick Nerve, as <HI>Des Cartes</HI> ingeniou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;es) the Fi|laments
cannot be &s;maller than the Micro&s;copical Pores of Wood, and that the
Eye is uncapable of di&s;tingui&s;hing the Parts of any Picture that are &s;maller than
tho&s;e: So that any Object being so far removed from the Eye as to make the
Picture of it on the Retira le&s;s than a Micro&s;copical Pore, that Object becomes
invi&s;ible, if a lea&s;t it be but of a dull Radiation; for if it be otherwi&s;e of a
very bright Radiation, the whole Filament is mov'd by having one part of it
powerfully acted on, and &s;o we have a Sen&s;ation of the Object, the &s;ame as if
it were much bigger, and this &s;eems to be the rea&s;on why the Stars appear to
<PB N="13" REF="47">
our naked Eye many Thou&s;and times bigger in bulk than really they are, and
even as big as through a long Tele&s;cope, which would not be if our Sen&s;e were
&s;ufficiently fine and nice. I could have in&s;tanc'd likewi&s;e in the other Sen&s;es,
but this may &s;uffice for an Example.</P>
<P>Having con&s;idered therefore the Power and Property of the Sen&s;e, we may
be &s;o much the better inabled to find out its Defeats, and by what means it
may be improv'd.</P>
<P>The Eye therefore pre&s;enting to the Sen&s;e a Picture of the Objects that are
plac'd before it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What this Sen&s;e informs us off, and how its Defects may be helped.</NOTE> is capable of Informing of the Sen&s;e of Four or Five Qualities
of Bodies, fir&s;t of the Radiation, or the &s;hining or not &s;hining Properties of Bo|dies,

of Bodies. 4. Of the Figure, Magnitude and Po&s;ition of Bodies. 5. Of
the Motion; when therefore the&s;e Proprieties of Bodies are inquir'd after, the
Information concerning the three fir&s;t mu&s;t be wholly fetcht from this Sen&s;e,
but the Information concerning the other two may be had partly from this and
partly al&s;o from &s;ome of the other Sen&s;es. In the di&s;covering of each of the&s;e
Properties, the Sen&s;e may be various ways a&s;&s;i&s;ted, both by Engines, Ob&s;erva|tions
and Experiments.</P>
<P>As Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st. It informs of the Radia|tion of Bodies.</NOTE> for the di&s;covering of the &s;hining Properties of many Bodies, there
are the&s;e two more immediate A&s;&s;i&s;tances; the fir&s;t is by placing the Eye and
Object in &s;uch a place where all other Radiations of Light may be wholly ex|cluded,
for by this means, many weak Degrees of Radiation will become vi|&s;ible
to the Eye, which in a greater Light would be altogether in&s;en&s;ible, and
this proceeds from a Twofold Cau&s;e; Fir&s;t, becau&s;e there is no &s;tronger Im|pre&s;&s;ion
made on the Eye from the Radiation of any other Object, which is the
rea&s;on why the Stars di&s;appear in the day time: Next the Eye thereby opens
its Apperture much wider, and &s;o admits a much greater number of Rays,
whence 'tis that the Eye by a long &s;tay in a &s;omewhat dark Room begins to
&s;ee and di&s;tingui&s;h things almo&s;t as well as in a much lighter, becau&s;e
the Apperture is not opened in an in&s;tant but by degrees. Hence the Radiation
of Gloworms Tails, of the Juice of the Hundred Legged Worm, of rotten Wood,
of Salt Water, of Putrifying Fi&s;h, of a rubbed or warmed Diamond, and the
like, becomes vi&s;ible to the naked Eye in a dark Room, which di&s;appears and
vani&s;hes in a bigger Light, but becau&s;e we find that the more Rays the Eye is
capable of collecting, the better is it able to di&s;cover this Propriety where it is
very languid; therefore if the Eye can by any Contrivance of Gla&s;&s;es be made
capable of collecting a much greater quantity of Rays from a Point, and ma|king
them meet on the Retina, 'tis not improbable but that a much greater
number of Bodies may be di&s;cover'd Radiant than are yet &s;uppos'd to be &s;uch,
perhaps al&s;o it may di&s;cover to us the Properties of many other Motions; for
it &s;eems not improbable, but that the Motions of Corro&s;ion in many Bodies
may generate &s;ome faint Degree of Light; perhaps al&s;o, the Motion of Fer|mentation,
and many Degrees of Heat, much le&s;s than what we now e&s;teem
requi&s;ite, may produce the like effect. And that this help of this Sen&s;e in this
Inquiry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">With &s;ome &s;uch Gla&s;&s;es it were very de&s;irable that Tryal &s;hould be made with &s;everal Bodies in a per|fectly dark Room, &s;uch as an unrubb'd or cold Diamond, with corroding Bodies, with fermenting Bo|dies, and &s;uch as are treated by various o|ther ways.</NOTE> is not a Suppo&s;ition without any ground from the Nature of the thing,
will appear fir&s;t in that Cats and Owls, and Bats, and divers other Creatures, are
able to &s;ee in a much le&s;s degree of Light than is &s;ufficient for a Man's Sight.
Next from this, that making Tryal upon this very Suppo&s;ition with a convenient
Lens, I have divers times been able to read in the Night by the help of it,
when I could hardly with my naked Eye di&s;tingui&s;h the Lines. Now this be|ing
done with an ordinary double Convex Spherical Lens, 'tis not improbable
but that much more may be done by a double Hyperbolical one, if the way
of making it can be found (which &s;eems not altogether improbable to be done
with Nicene&s;s enough as to this u&s;e of collecting the Rays of Light, though in
Gla&s;s it be very difficult to be done accurate enough for di&s;tinct Vi&s;ion) or by
the help of an Elliptical Concave, by placing the Body to be examin'd in one
of its Focu&s;es, and the Eye with a Concave Lens before it in the other, and for
this u&s;e 'tis ea&s;y enough to make a Concave &s;ufficiently accurate of an Ellipti|cal
Figure.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="48">
Farther, If our Eyes &s;hould not be capable of being brought up to &s;uch a
Degree of Nicene&s;s in Sen&s;ation as is requi&s;ite; 'tis not impo&s;&s;ible but that by
&s;ome Ob&s;ervations and Tryals, one may come to the Knowledge of the Truth
as to this Inquiry. 'Tis po&s;&s;ible perhaps to find a way to di&s;cover whether a
Cat or &s;ome &s;uch other Creature can &s;ee by &s;uch a Light, which I think might
be many ways done, were it not much ea&s;ier and more certain to make a Di&s;|covery
with ones own Eyes, and that perhaps to as great, if not much greater
Degree of Nicety than Cats can.</P>
<P>There may perhaps al&s;o be found, upon farther Inquiry into the Nature of
things, &s;ome Body that is acted on or mov'd by Light, which is much more &s;en|&s;ible
of the Degrees thereof than the Eye, which, if found, would be a huge
A&s;&s;i&s;tance to a diligent Inquirer into this Property of Body; and for this we
may have &s;ome rea&s;on to hope, if we con&s;ider, how lately 'tis that the Beard
of an Oat was found out for the Sen&s;ation of the Moi&s;ture or Dryne&s;s of the
Air: And 'tis not yet above&mdash;Years &s;ince I fir&s;t di&s;cover'd the like, but
&s;omewhat more nice Property in the Seeds of <HI>Geranium Mo&s;chatum: Athana&s;ius
Kircher</HI> tells us, that the Sun-Flower follows the Light of the Sun, but whe|ther
true or not, I di&s;pute not now: Sufficient it is to the pre&s;ent De&s;ign (which
is only to hint by what ways po&s;&s;ibly the Sen&s;e may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted) to &s;hew that
&s;uch an Help is not altogether improbable to be found. Perhaps al&s;o the aug|menting
the Bulk of &s;uch a Body, may make that Propriety become &s;en&s;ble
which might otherwi&s;e lie hid.</P>
<P>Next as to the Pellucidity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2dly, Of their Pellucidity.</NOTE> Colours, or Opacou&s;ne&s;s of Bodies, the Eye may
be various ways a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the finding out that Propriety and reducing its De|grees
to a Mea&s;ure or Standard. One way is, by placing the examining Eye in
a Room perfectly darkened, without any Cranny to admit Light into it, &s;ave
only one or two Holes; again&s;t one of which whil&s;t the other is quite &s;top the
Body to be examin'd may be plac'd, of various Thickne&s;&s;es according to its di|&s;tinct
Nature: The more tran&s;parent it be, the thicker Ma&s;s of Body may be
&s;een through, and the more opacous, the thinner mu&s;t the plated Body be:
And by this Contrivance a great Number of Bodies will be found <HI>aliquatenus</HI>
tran&s;parent, which are judg'd wholly opacous, and by the Thinne&s;s, requi&s;ite
to admit a &s;en&s;ible Degree of Light through, may the comparative Opacity of
Bodies be found and determin'd.</P>
<P>A &s;econd way whereby the Eye may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted in this Inquiry, is by the Mi|cro&s;cope;
for the Body being, by beating or otherwi&s;e, reduced into &s;mall
parts, the Micro&s;cope does plainly di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e Particles <HI>aliquatenus</HI> tran|&s;parent.
Thus the parts of mo&s;t &s;orts of Stones when reduc'd to Sand, appear
manife&s;tly tran&s;parent, the mo&s;t Metalline and other Colours u&s;ed by Painters,
appear to con&s;i&s;t of &s;omewhat tran&s;parent Parts, and very many of tho&s;e Bodies
which the Eye is not able to di&s;cover &s;uch the other way, is by this means
very eas&s;ily manife&s;ted; and indeed, there &s;eems to be &s;carce any Body in Na|ture,
unle&s;s perhaps &s;ome of the white Metaline that are not in &s;ome Degree or
other tran&s;parent, and this is &s;o much the more probable; &s;ince we find that the
mo&s;t compacted, we know in the World, namely Gold, is manife&s;tly tran&s;pa|rent,
when beaten very thin and held up again&s;t the Light.</P>
<P>Next, the Tran&s;parency, Opacity, or Colours of Bodies may be farther in|quired
into, by mixing and incorporating &s;everal of them with divers &s;orts of
appropriated Homogeneous Tran&s;parent Bodies; that is, with &s;uch as with
whom they will readily mix. Thus Cochineel, which looks like an opacous
dark Body, when mixt with Water that di&s;&s;olves it, yields a tran&s;parent Crim|&s;on
Colour. Thus Iron melted with Gla&s;s yields a kind of Red. Thus Copper
mixt or di&s;&s;olv'd by &s;ome Saline Liquors yields a Green, with others a Blew,
with others a Purple. Thus many &s;orts of Stones and Earths, which &s;eemed
before perfectly opacous, by this means &s;hew their Colour.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3dly, Of their Reflexivene&s;s.</NOTE> The reflecting Property of Bodies may be partly di&s;cover'd and di|&s;tingui&s;ht
by the above-mention'd Methods, and partly al&s;o by reducing the Bodies
into the Shape of a Burning-Gla&s;s of a determinate Bigne&s;s, and &s;moothing the
Superficies of it very well; for by the comparing of divers of those In&s;truments
<PB N="15" REF="49">
&s;o made, by the Effects of burning they produce when expos'd o the Sun, 'twill
not be difficult to determine the comparative Power of reflecting the Rays of
Light.</P>
<P>Another way of judging of the comparative Reflection of Bodies, may be by
viewing them in a Micro&s;cope in &s;everal Lights, and with &s;everal Apertures;
and by pitching upon &s;ome one Body to the Strength of the Reflection of which
the proportionate Reflection of all the re&s;t may be referr'd; for by knowing the
Smalne&s;s of the Aperture of the Gla&s;s requi&s;ite to make each of them di&s;appear,
we know al&s;o their comparative Power of Reflection.</P>
<P>Tryal al&s;o of this Property may be made with the Eye, only a&s;&s;i&s;ted with
&s;everal Apertures, and only finding the Smalne&s;s of the Aperture requi&s;ite to
make the Reflection of Light from &s;uch a Body to disappear.</P>
<P>The U&s;e of which Inquiry into this Property of Bodies may be of very great
U&s;e, as to the Invention of the Nature and Texture of Bodies.</P>
<P>Fourthly, As to the Magnitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4thly, Of their Magnitude, Fi|gure, and Po|&s;ition.</NOTE> Figure, and Po&s;ition of Bodies, though the
Eye can pretty well gue&s;s at them in Bodies pretty near, and within its reach
as 'twere, yet beyond that, and even in that too if Accuratene&s;s be required;
it is deficient, and does much need the Help of In&s;truments and Contrivances to
a&s;&s;ist it.</P>
<P>As to the Magnitude and Po&s;ition of Bodies; the Eye may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by ma|king
Experiments with divers &s;orts of Mathematical In&s;truments, e&s;pecially by
the U&s;e of &s;ome which I &s;hall afterwards de&s;cribe, by which means the Mag|nitude,
Di&s;tance, and Po&s;ition of the Cele&s;tial Bodies, that are &s;o far out of our
reach, may be much more accurately mea&s;ur'd, than by any other &s;ort of In|&s;trument
yet made publick to the World.</P>
<P>As for the Figure and Magnitude of &s;ome Bodies; the Eye (being unable to
di&s;tingui&s;h the Po&s;ition of Parts, when the Appearance of them is le&s;s than &s;uch
an Angle) may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by two &s;orts of In&s;truments, namely the Tele&s;cope for
the appearing Figure of &s;mall Bodies, ab&s;ent, and out of our reach; and the
Mi&s;cro&s;cope for &s;uch minute Bodies as we have acce&s;s to; the Melioration of
both which In&s;truments would be a Matter of huge Concernment, as to the
Re&s;olution of this Inquiry. And I cannot doubt, but that the Indu&s;try of &s;ome
of the many Ingenious Men, that are now imploy'd about it, will be &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sful
as to accompli&s;h it.</P>
<P>The Figures al&s;o of &s;ome, inacce&s;&s;ible Bodies may be judg'd by the Ob&s;erva|tion
of divers Circum&s;tances: Thus the ingenious Mon&s;ieur <HI>Hygens</HI> di&s;cover'd
the true Figure of the Body of <HI>Saturn,</HI> which had &s;o much puzled Learned
Men before.</P>
<P>Fifthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5thly, Of their Motion.</NOTE> The Eye may be various ways a&s;&s;i&s;ted for the Di&s;covery of the Mo|tion
and Velocity of Bodies; as by mea&s;uring the time it has pa&s;t &s;uch a
length or &s;pace by the help of a Pendulum, and whereas the Motion of &s;ome
Bodies is &s;o &s;low that their Velocity does not make a &s;en&s;ible Angle the Eye,
therefore the Velocity of &s;uch Motions is be&s;t gathered by Con&s;equents, &s;uch
as all the Motions of the Cele&s;tial Bodies, many of which cannot be otherwi&s;e
di&s;cern'd.</P>
<P>The Internal Motions al&s;o of Bodies may be di&s;cover'd by various Effects,
&s;uch as tho&s;e of Fermentation, Heat, Corruption, Generation, Growth, Decay,
Di&s;&s;olution, Coagulation, and the like, from the accurate Ob&s;ervation of di|vers
of which compared with &s;everal other Circum&s;tances, may be very well
collected the Degree, Nature and Manner of Internal Motions.</P>
<P>The Tele&s;cope al&s;o and Micro&s;cope may much a&s;&s;i&s;t the Eye in this Inquiry;
thus the Body of the Sun has been found to vertiginate on its Axis. I did al&s;o
by the Help of a good Tele&s;cope, about two Years; &s;ince, di&s;cover the Motion
of &Jupit; about its own Axis, by means of a &s;omewhat darker &s;pot in the Body of
it; the Moon, &Saturn;, and &Jupit; have al&s;o been found to have a Motion of Libration,
the Satellites of &Jupit; and Moon of <HI>Saturn</HI> to make their Periodick Revolution in
&s;uch or &s;uch a time. The Micro&s;cope al&s;o can make the Motion of the Legs
of Mites, and many other &s;mall Creatures &s;en&s;ible, as al&s;o the Motion of the
Hand of a Watch, and perhaps al&s;o Mi&s;cro&s;copes may be made so accurate as
<PB N="16" REF="50">
to di&s;cover the vegetating Motion of Plants (though I confe&s;s I have not yet
found the Growth of any &s;o fa&s;t as to be quickly &s;en&s;ible through a Micro|&s;cope)
and of corro&s;ive and corroding Liquors, and the like; however in the
&s;earch after every of the&s;e the Eye is not left without many A&s;&s;i&s;tances, where|by
it may perfectly di&s;cover what it &s;eeks after.</P>
<P>Thus for the finding the Velocity and Strength of falling Bodies, I made this
following Contrivance, which &s;ucceeded according to Expectation.</P>
<P>The In&s;trument was thus contrived. See the 1&s;t.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A De&s;cription of the In&s;tru|ment for fal|ling Bodies. Vid. the Fig.</NOTE> Figure in which ABC is the
Pede&s;tal or Bottom to &s;u&s;tain the Scales and other Parts. DE a double Beam,
or two Beams well fa&s;tened together by cro&s;s pieces of Steel at the Ends,
of other ways, between the two Cheeks of which the Steel Ball F falls
from any determinate Height upon the Steel Plate or Ba&s;in G; and if by that
Fall it moves the double Beam and the Counterpoi&s;e H, lying in the Scale
IK, it gives the &s;mall Spring L a free Pa&s;&s;age to &s;lip between the end of the
double Beam and the Stay M, by which means there is given a certain Sign
whether the falling Body has moved the Scale or Counterpoi&s;e &s;o far, as to ad|mit
the very thin Edge of the Spring L, the re&s;t of the Contrivance is obvious
enough from the Scheme it &s;elf. <HI>&startq;That the Reader may the better under&s;tand
the U&s;e and Performance of this In&s;trument, I have added &s;ome of the Experi|ments
made with it, as I find them entered in the Regi&s;ters of the Royal Society,
which I thought might not be unacceptable to the Ingenious.</HI> R. W.&endq;</P>
<Q>The Account is as follows,</Q>
<P>&startq;The In&s;trument being thus prepared, I. <HI>(i. e.</HI> Dr. <HI>Hook)</HI> put into the oppo|&s;ite
Scale <HI>IK,</HI> a 4 Ounce Weight <HI>H</HI> that is four times the Weight of the Steel
Ball <HI>F,</HI> and letting this Steel Ball or Bullet <HI>F</HI> fall from ju&s;t the Height of an
Inch above the Steel Plate <HI>G</HI> (by cutting the Thread that held it) I found is
very &s;en&s;ibly to move it; I repeated the Tryal &s;o long, till I found that letting
this Ball fall but 4/21 of an Inch above the Plate, it would move the Beam &s;o as
to admit the Spring; but if I let it fall from a le&s;s Height it would not, then
I put in 8 Ounces, and by &s;everal repeated Tryals, I found &frac23; of an Inch to be
the Height requi&s;ite for the falling Bullet to pa&s;s, before it would move 8 times
its own Weight, I proceeded farther, and from the Experiments collected in the
fir&s;t Table <HI>A.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Afterwards I took a &s;mall Ball of Clay that was very ronnd, and exceeding
hard, in Weight near a quarter of an Ounce, and proceeding with this as I had
done with the Steel, I collected from the &s;everal Tryals the Second Table <HI>B.</HI>&endq;</P>

<P>&startq;The fir&s;t row of Numbers in both which Tables &s;hew the perpendicular Height
from which the Balls were let fall, to move the &s;everal Counterpoi&s;es which
are noted by the &s;econd Row of Numbers in both Tables, 4, 8, 16, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;ignifying
the Counterpoi&s;e to be 4, 8, 16, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> times the Weight of the Ball.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Which Tryals and Ob&s;ervations, though they do not ab&s;olutely an&s;wer our
Expectation as to the thing &s;ought, that a Body moved with twice the Celerity
acquires twice the Force, yet they &s;erve for &s;everal good U&s;es; for fir&s;t, it &s;hews
us the Difficulty of &s;uch Tryals, where though all things as to ones Sen&s;e appeared
the &s;ame, yet &s;ome &s;mall in&s;en&s;ible Circum&s;tances made the Effects &s;o differing,
that we need not wonder, if oftentimes when we endeavour to repeat an Experi|ment
<PB N="17" REF="51">
delivered upon good Credit, as done by another with &s;uch or &s;uch Mate|rials,
thus or thus us'd, though we do all things ju&s;t according to Pre&s;criptions,
yet we mi&s;s of producing the promi&s;ed Effects. And therefore I conceive it not
le&s;s in&s;tructive to any one that may attempt to make a farther Di&s;covery of
this kind, to &s;hew wherein our pre&s;ent Tryals were deficient, than to declare
what they did.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Now the fir&s;t and greate&s;t Defect in our Tryals &s;eems to be, that there is a
yielding in the Materials which we make u&s;e of; fir&s;t, that part of the Ball which
fir&s;t touches the Plain is a little flatted by the Knock, and con&s;equently a part
of the Force is returned into the Ball, and &s;o lo&s;t. Secondly, The yielding of the
Plate; thirdly, the &s;tretching the Ears of the Plate, every one of which yieldings
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily take off from the Force of the falling Ball, that it cannot work
the expected Effect &s;o accurately as it would were tho&s;e remov'd.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Next in this Contrivance, there is be&s;ides the Counterpoi&s;e of Weights, a
great deal of a ma&s;&s;y heavy Body, namely, the double Beam, and the Plate, and
Scale; all which, or at lea&s;t the greate&s;t part of it, mu&s;t be moved, and that
with a very quick and &s;udden Motion before the Spring, though it be &s;o very
thin can get between the End of the Beam and Stay, to make the Effect &s;en&s;ible.
Now this quick Motion it &s;elf does require a con&s;iderable Strength to effect it,
were the Counterpoi&s;e remov'd; for &s;uch a Bulk of Body cannot be put into &s;uch
a quick Degree of Motion, but by another Bulk of Body mov'd with a determinate
Degree of Celerity.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Thirdly, The Scales and Counterpoi&s;e may be all mov'd, and yet the &s;mall
Spring, though it be &s;o thin as not to be above 1/40 or 1/50 part of an Inch in Thick|ne&s;s,
yet is that a Space, and the Beam may perhaps be moved half that way,
and the forcible Re&s;i&s;tance of Gravity may make it return back again before it
have mov'd the whole Space, &s;o that it may be moved a little, and yet not &s;o
much as to make it &s;en&s;ible by this Contrivance. Nor would the making that
Spring thiner much mend the matter, &s;ince there are other Inconveniences: And
that this is &s;o, I try'd the following Experiment, when in my la&s;t Tryal I had
found that the Ball of a quarter of an Ounce required to be let fall from the
Height of 36 Inches, before it would move the end of the Beam &s;o much as to
let in the Spring, when there was 128 times its Weight of Counterpoi&s;e, that I
might try whether the &s;ame Ball would not &s;en&s;ibly move the &s;ame Counterpoi&s;e,
though it were let fall from a much &s;maller Height. I placed the Spring &s;o as that
it was between the Stay and the end of the Beam, but not &s;o far in as it would
&s;pring in if it were left free; then letting fall the Ball at 4 Inches Height, I
found that it had moved the end &s;ufficiently to let the Spring &s;lide in as far as
it would, I put the Spring in Order as before, and let it fall from 3&frac12; Inches
Height, and found it there likewi&s;e to move the end of the Beam.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I repeated it again at 3 Inches Height, but though I try'd &s;everal times, I could
not find that it had at all moved or let &s;lip the Spring. Now as exact Tryals
of this kind may be very u&s;eful in Mechanicks, &s;o could they be made with Bo|dies
perfectly &s;olid, would they be for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of one of the chief Prin|ciples
of Philo&s;ophy, namely, the Strength a Body moved has to move another.
And though <HI>Des Cartes</HI> puts it as a Principle, that <HI>Si Corpus C plane qui|e&s;ceret
e&s;&s;etq; paulo majus quam B, quacum&abque; cum celeritate B moveretur
ver&s;us C nunquam ip&s;um C moveret, &s;ed ab eo repelleretur in contrariam
partem,</HI> and gives this Rea&s;on for it, <HI>Quia Corpus quie&s;cens magis re&s;i&s;tit
magnae celeritati quam parvae, id&abque; pro ratione exce&s;&s;us unius &s;upra alteram.
Et idcirco &s;emper major e&s;&s;et vis in C ad re&s;i&s;tendum, quam in B ad impel|lendum:</HI>
Yet the&s;e Experiments do rather &s;eem to hint, that the lea&s;t Body by
any acquir'd Celerity, may be able to move the greate&s;t, though how much of its
Motion is imparted to the bigger Body, and how much of it is recoil'd into the
&s;maller be not hereby determin'd.&endq;</P>
<P>But to proceed, I could thus have gone over all the other Sen&s;es, by examin|ing
their particular Con&s;truction, and what Proprieties of Bodies they each of
them take Notice of, what Information they can afford us alone, and where
they leave us, and by what In&s;truments and Methods they might be helpt and
a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the Pro&s;ecution of the Inquiry. But the&s;e being more proper to be
<PB N="18" REF="52">
in&s;tanced in hereafter, when I come to give Examples of this Method for the
finding out of particular Inquiries, and my Bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent being only to
give a Specimen for the Explication of my De&s;ign, and as it is preparatory to
the finding out &s;uch Helps for the Sen&s;es for making Di&s;coveries as may a&s;&s;i&s;t
a Natural Hi&s;torian in the collecting of Materials for a Philo&s;ophical Supellex,
to fill up the Repo&s;itory of the Memory withal; for the Ratiocination to work
on, for finding out the Cau&s;es, Manner, and Method of Nature's proceeding
in all tho&s;e Operations, we inquire into. I &s;hall now pa&s;s on to con&s;ider of
tho&s;e other Faculties of the Soul, namely, Memory and Ratiocination. The
Bu&s;ine&s;s of the former being nothing el&s;e but a faithful Pre&s;ervation of the
things committed to it, and a ready recollecting them when nece&s;&s;ary, will be
rectified and perfected by this Method of the Philo&s;ophick Algebra, and the
rectifying and perfecting of the Rea&s;on, we &s;hall refer to another Oppor|tunity.</P>
<P>The &s;econd thing therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Part II.</HI> Of collecting the Phenomena of Nature, for the compiling an Hi&s;troy.</NOTE> is a Method of collecting a Philo&s;ophical Hi|&s;tory,
which &s;hall be as the Repo&s;itory of Materials, out of which a new and
&s;ound Body of Philo&s;ophy may be rai&s;ed. This is to comprize a brief and plain
the Account of a great Store of choice and &s;ignificant Natural and Artificial Opera|tions,
Actions and Effects, ranged in a convenient Order, and interwoven here
and there with &s;ome &s;hort Hints of Accidental Remarks or Theories, of corre|&s;ponding
or di&s;agreeing received Opinions, of Doubts and Queries and the like,
and indeed until this Repo&s;itory be pretty well &s;tored with choice and found
Materials, the Work of rai&s;ing new Axiomes or Theories is not to be attem|pted,
le&s;t beginning without Materials, the whole De&s;ign be given over in the
middle, for out of this are to be taken like Foundation Stones, on which the
whole Structure &s;hould be rai&s;ed, and tho&s;e ought to be proportioned according
to the re&s;t of the Materials; for otherwi&s;e there may follow great Inconvenien|ces,
in pro&s;ecuting of it, here therefore ought to be laid up the more &s;ub&s;tan|tial
Parts: But as for the mo&s;t curious and precious things which may &s;erve
for the fini&s;hing or compleating this grand Structure, they are to be &s;ought for
as occa&s;ion &s;hall require and prompt. For as in any great building, none can be
&s;o per&s;picacious as to fore&s;ee every particular thing he &s;hall need, for the com|pleating
of it, but leaves the Care of providing them till occa&s;ions call for
them, as being then be&s;t able to judge which of that kind of Material which
is wanting will be mo&s;t fitting for his purpo&s;e, and &s;o with that proceeds till
other occa&s;ions call for other Requi&s;ites and Helps: And &s;o from time
to time furni&s;hes himself with tho&s;e more choice things, as the Occa&s;ions require; &s;o
there is none but before he &s;ets upon &s;uch a De&s;ign, will be &s;ure to provide
himself of a &s;ufficient Store of &s;uch Materials as he knows altogether nece&s;&s;ary,
nor will he neglect to lay hold on &s;uch things, as offering them&s;elves by chance, put
him in mind that he &s;hall have occa&s;ion for them before he can fini&s;h his De&s;ign;
and certainly much better it were, if the Architect were &s;o skilful as to fore&s;ee
to provide all kinds of Materials before he begins; for thereby his Work would
be carried on the more compleatly and uniformly, without Nece&s;&s;ity of pulling
down, or altering, or piecing, or transforming any part, or &s;taying or inter|rupting.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e is much the &s;ame in providing a proper Hi&s;tory for the perfecting
of a new Body of Philo&s;ophy, the Intellect &s;hould fir&s;t like a skilful Architect,
under&s;tand what it de&s;igns to do, and then con&s;ider as near as can be, what
things are requi&s;ite to be provided in order to this De&s;ign, then tho&s;e Materials
are to be carefully &s;ought for and collected, and &s;afely laid up in &s;o convenient
an Order, that they may not be far to &s;eek when they are wanting, nor hard
to be come by when they are found: In the choice of which, Care ought to be
taken that they are &s;ound and good, and cleans'd and freed from all tho&s;e things
which are &s;uperfluous and in&s;ignificant to the great De&s;ign; for tho&s;e do nothing
el&s;e but help to fill the Repo&s;itory, and to incumber and perplex the U&s;er, yet
notwith&s;tanding, Brevity is not &s;o much to be &s;tudied, as to omit many little
Circum&s;tances which may be con&s;iderable in the u&s;e of it, for as in the laying
up of Timber, the keeping on a branching part does make it &s;erviceable for
many De&s;igns which it would be wholly unfit for, if it had been &s;quared off,
&s;o it will be in the fitting and preparing the Particulars for a Philo&s;ophical Hi|&s;tory,
<PB N="19" REF="53">
there mu&s;t be Judgment in the Hi&s;torian to di&s;cern what will be material
and u&s;eful in general, and what will be more e&s;pecially adapted for the In|quiry
whatever he de&s;igns.</P>
<P>This Similitude therefore hints unto us the whole Method of making a Phi|lo&s;ophical
Hi&s;tory, according to which, I &s;hall enumerate the &s;everal things ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to this De&s;ign, and according to my Ability, endeavour to explain each
Particular in &s;uch Order, and &s;o far forth as to me &s;eems mo&s;t natural and con|&s;onant
to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e. But fir&s;t I &s;hall premi&s;e &s;ome of the Accom|pli&s;hments
requi&s;ite for a Natural Hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>There &s;eem therefore the&s;e Requi&s;ites to accompli&s;h one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect; 1. Of the Requi&s;ites in a Natural Hi|&s;torian.</NOTE> that intends to
pro&s;ecute or do any thing con&s;iderable in this Work, without which the Col|lections
may very much fail of the de&s;irable Excellency in this or that Particu|lar,
though perhaps as to the kind they may contain many good things.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t is, That he ought to be very well skill'd in tho&s;e &s;everal kinds of
Philo&s;ophy already known, to under&s;tand their &s;everal Hypothe&s;es, Suppo&s;i|tions,
Collections, Ob&s;ervations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> their various ways of Ratiocinations and
Proceedings, the &s;everal Failings and Defects both in their way of Rai&s;ing, and
in their way of managing their &s;everal Theories: For by this Means the Mind
will be &s;omewhat more ready at gue&s;&s;ing at the Solution of many Phenomena
almo&s;t at fir&s;t Sight, and thereby be much more prompt at making Queries, and
at tracing the Subtilty of Nature, and in di&s;covering and &s;earching into the true
Rea&s;on of things; and though perhaps none of tho&s;e Methods of Philo&s;ophy
he has been accu&s;tomed to, may any way direct him in the Contrivance of this
New Fabrick, yet 'tis with the Exerci&s;es of the Mind as with the Operations of
the Body; one that has been bred up, and well skill'd in any Trade, &s;hall go
much more readily and handily about it, and make a much better piece of Work
of a quite new De&s;ign in that Trade, than one that has not been at all us'd to
&s;uch kind of Operations; there mu&s;t be a time to bring and fix the Mind to a
Regard and Heedfulne&s;s of this kind of Contemplation, and a time al&s;o to ac|cu&s;tom
it to Meditation and Contrivance, and a time to acquaint it with ratio|nating
from material Ob&s;ervations before it can go about &s;uch a De&s;ign dexte|rous&s;ly.
Be&s;ides this al&s;o, the Mind will, by being acquainted with various Con|jectures
and Solutions of things, be much &s;ooner and better freed from Preju|dice;
for by di&s;covering experimentally the Errors in this or that Hypothe&s;is,
'twill be much ea&s;ier taken off from adhering to any, and &s;o enjoy a greater
Freedom of perceiving and imbracing Truth from what occa&s;ion &s;oever it be
offered.</P>
<P>Next, As he ought to be knowing in Hypothe&s;es, &s;o ought he al&s;o to be ve|ry
well furni&s;hed with tho&s;e things, which will mo&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t the Mind in making,
examining, and ratiocinating from Experiments. And the&s;e are chiefly two,
Mathematicks and Mechanicks; the one &s;omewhat more &s;peculative, the other
more practical: The one qualifying the Mind with a mo&s;t exact Idea and Pat|tern
of Ratiocination, Demon&s;tration, Invention, and Detection: The other ac|quainting
and in&s;tructing it with the Proce&s;&s;es of Action, and Operation. He
ought fir&s;t of all, and chiefly to be very well skill'd in Geometry and Arithme|tick,
the more demon&s;trative Parts, and Algebra the more inventive Part of it:
And this not only, as it furni&s;hes the Mind as it were with Numbers, Weights,
and Mea&s;ures to inquire into, examine and prove all things; but as it al&s;o in|&s;tructs
and accu&s;toms the Mind to a more &s;trict way of Rea&s;oning, to a more
nice and exact way of examining, and to a much more accurate way of inqui|ring
into the Nature of things: The other more Phy&s;ical Parts of Mathematicks are
al&s;o very u&s;eful in their kind, &s;hewing a Way and Method of applying the for|mer
to Phy&s;ical U&s;es and Inquiries. Mechanicks al&s;o being partly Phy&s;ical, and
partly Mathematical, do bring the Mind more clo&s;ely to the Bu&s;ine&s;s it de&s;igns,
and &s;hews it a Pattern of Demon&s;tration, in Phy&s;ical Operations, manife&s;ts the
po&s;&s;ible Ways, how Powers may act in the moving re&s;i&s;ting Bodies: Gives a
Scheme of the Laws and Rules of Motion, and as it were enters the Mind into
a Method of accurate and demon&s;trative Inquiry and Examination of Phy&s;ical
Operations. For though the Operations of Nature are more &s;ecret and ab&s;tru&s;e;
<PB N="20" REF="54">
and hid from our di&s;cerning, or di&s;covering of them, than tho&s;e more gro&s;s and
obvious ones of Engines, yet it &s;eems mo&s;t probable, by the Effects and Cir|cum&s;tances;
that mo&s;t of them may be as capable of Demon&s;tration and Re|duction
to a certain Rule, as the Operations of Mechanicks or Art. And from
tho&s;e, which are yet &s;omewhat more &s;peculative, he ought to proceed to ac|quaint
him&s;elf with others more complicated Mechanical Operations: Such as
Chymical, and the Phy&s;ical, yea even divers Mechanical Operations in many
other Trades: For by the&s;e Ways, he will be better acquainted and enabled how
to deal with Nature, for the procuring and getting more hidden Jewels and
greate&s;t My&s;teries. But this is not yet enough, for the way to acquire these
things certainly is not as yet fully di&s;covered, much le&s;s has it been practi&s;ed,
he cannot have a Pilot to direct him certainly, to &s;hew the Cour&s;e, and
de&s;cribe all the Turnings and Windings, and Shoalds, and many other Diffi|culties
that are to be met withal, in this Attempt: Mo&s;t of the&s;e things mu&s;t
be left to his own prudent and wary Management of his own De&s;igns.</P>
<P>And, as <HI>Columbus</HI> did in the Di&s;covery of the New World of <HI>America,</HI> he
ought to contrive his De&s;ign well; then to procure what Helps and A&s;&s;i&s;tances
he is able, la&s;tly, thoroughly to pro&s;ecute it, and not be di&s;couraged by the
many Cro&s;&s;es and ill Succe&s;&s;es he may at fir&s;t chance to meet with in the At|tempt,
and afterwards al&s;o in the Pro&s;ecution thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Therefore being thus well provided, he ought very thoroughly and
&s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider of his De&s;ign; and this he &s;hould do fir&s;t by propo&s;ing to him|&s;elf
the end of his Inquiry; then by con&s;idering from the Nature of the Inquiry,
what things &s;eem mo&s;t likely to be conducive thereunto, and accordingly to &s;et
down tho&s;e things as <HI>quae&s;ita</HI> or Requi&s;ites; then further to con&s;ider well, and
contrive by what means each of the&s;e Properties may be attain'd, <HI>viz.</HI> By what
Experiments or Ob&s;ervations, what Engines, and Contrivances are nece&s;&s;ary,
and how to be u&s;ed: And for this end it is altogether nece&s;&s;ary, that he be
able to de&s;ign and draw very well, thereby to be able both to expre&s;s his own
Ideas the better to him&s;elf, to enable him to examine them and ratiocinate up|on
them him&s;elf, and al&s;o for the better informing and in&s;tructing of others;
for there are many things which cannot be made as plain to the Under&s;tand|ing,
by a large De&s;cription in Words, as by the Delineation of them in a quar|ter
of a Sheet of Paper. Drawing therefore is not only nece&s;&s;ary in point of In|vention
of Mechanick Contrivances and Demon&s;trations, but for the Regi&s;tring
Particulars, and compiling a de&s;irable Hi&s;tory. Next, Having contrived his
Methods of Examination, he ought to pro&s;ecute them with great Diligence and
Judgment, in ordering, u&s;ing, and deducing from them.</P>
<P>4<HI>thly,</HI> In the Pro&s;ecution of each of which, he ought to proceed with the
greate&s;t Degree of Candor and Freedom from Prejudice, not to be by a&s;&s;ed by
this or that Opinion in making of Deductions, nor by the Plea&s;antne&s;s or Gain|fulne&s;s
of the Experiment, or any other by Con&s;ideration that does not imme|diately
look at the pre&s;ent Di&s;covery he is &s;earching after; for though tho&s;e
things are not to be wholly neglected, but rather mark'd by the by, and <HI>in tran|&s;itu,</HI>
yet the Mind is not to dwell upon them, or look otherwi&s;e after them,
than as they are conducive to the pre&s;ent Inquiry, as they manife&s;t a Truth or
di&s;cover an Error, left like &s;weet &s;inging Syrens they &s;educe their Followers
out of their right way to their utter De&s;truction. He ought al&s;o to proceed
with the greate&s;t Circum&s;pection and Diligence to find out &s;uch things, as are
Indications of what he &s;eeks, and from tho&s;e to take Incouragement to pro&s;e|cute
his Intentions, as <HI>Columbus</HI> did from the decrea&s;ing Depth of the Sea, the
Drift of Weeds on the Surface of the Water, and the White Clouds that ap|pear'd
near the Horizon, and the like to incourage and direct him in his
Course.</P>
<P>5. He ought to get what Help he can from others to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in this his Un|dertaking;
for 'tis to be expected from the &s;ingle Endeavours of any one
Man, though there mo&s;t accompli&s;ht, that any great Matter &s;hould be done,
Man's Life will be well near half &s;pent, before he can be fit to undertake this
<PB N="21" REF="55">
Work, and 'twill be a long time afterwards, before a &s;ufficient Supellex can be
gathered by his &s;ingle Endeavours: Be&s;ides, there is much of Expence requi&s;ite,
which every one cannot &s;o well bear, that may perhaps be otherwi&s;e fit for this
Employment; he mu&s;t therefore here al&s;o imitate <HI>Columbus,</HI> endeavour to be
provided with Ships, and Men, and Money, and all tho&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tances he finds
requi&s;ite for the thorough Pro&s;ecution of this Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>6. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> He ought, as <HI>Columbus</HI> did freely and impartially to di&s;cover
what he finds; but yet with particular and more e&s;pecial Regard to the great
Promoters and Benefactors of this De&s;ign; and what A&s;&s;i&s;tances he has receiv'd
he ought candidly to acknowledge: And what&s;oever he regi&s;ters, he ought to
do it in the plaine&s;t, &s;horte&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;ignificant De&s;cription, the Matter is
capable of, and in &s;uch a Method as may neither cau&s;e Repetition of Hi&s;tory,
in more places than one, nor the Rejection of &s;ome others, becau&s;e it fits not
punctually to his Method: He ought likewi&s;e to own what Information any
one has contributed toward the compiling of &s;uch a Hi&s;tory; and to be as care|ful
that he be not impos'd on, either by the Ignorance or Deceit of &s;uch as &s;eem
to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting.</P>
<P>The next thing to be con&s;idered is, what the Subject of his Enquiry is; which
I &s;hall endeavour to explain, by &s;etting down the General Scheme of the whole
Matter, about which a Philo&s;ophical Hi&s;tory is to treat.</P>
<P>And this is not of le&s;s extent than the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&sect;II. The Subject of Philo&s;o|phical Hi&s;tory in general.</NOTE> there is no Body or Opera|tion
in the Univer&s;e, at lea&s;t if it can be way brought to our that Knowledge,

mo&s;t precious are here not more con&s;iderable, nor perhaps &s;o much as the mo&s;t
trivial and vile. Every thing is here to be taken notice of only as it is lucriferous
or conducive to the Di&s;covery of Truth, and for a while at lea&s;t the Lucriferou&s;|ne&s;s
of any that occurs (unle&s;s for the Cau&s;e of encouraging others in the Search)
is to be omitted; le&s;t thereby the Mind be diverted before it have gone through
with its fir&s;t Undertaking. Nor though the Volumes requi&s;ite to be filled
with this kind of Hi&s;tory be many, and &s;o may &s;eem to confound the Mind
with the very thought of making u&s;e, or examining over the Particulars there|in,
and much more with the thought of compiling and collecting them; yet if
we con&s;ider but the Volumes that are already writ on Subjects that have much
le&s;s of Reality, and tho&s;e perhaps by &s;ome one Man, and the Volumes he has been
fain to tumble and &s;earch over for the collecting of the Matter contain'd in them,
be&s;ide&s; the Multitude of Thoughts and Perplexities of Mind in &s;pinning out
Niceties and ranging them, we may find the Labour and Perplexities of the&s;e
Collections of real things, nothing comparable for Difficulty to tho&s;e of Fiction,
and Imagination; for I have very good Rea&s;on to believe, that the whole Ma&s;s
of Natural Hi&s;tory, may be contain'd in much fewer words than the Writings
of divers &s;ingle Authors: And the Method of u&s;ing them will be much more
ea&s;y, and the Labour of interpreting or under&s;tanding them, if done aright,
will be almo&s;t as ea&s;y as to unravel a Bottom when you begin at the right end.
The Method of di&s;tributing the Matter of Philo&s;ophical Hi&s;tory, both for ma|king
Heads of Inquiry, and con&s;equently al&s;o of regi&s;tring them, need not be
very nice or curious, they being in them laid up only in Heaps as it were, as
in a Granary or Store-Hou&s;e; from thence afterwards to be tran&s;cribed, fitted,
ordered and rang'd, and Tabled, as I &s;hall afterward explain to be made fit
for U&s;e; for (as I in&s;tanced before) a &s;ufficient &s;tore of &s;ound and good Mate|rials,
ought to be collected before the Work of Super&s;tructure can be begun.</P>
<P>We will divide the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of Philo&s;ophical Hi&s;tory into the&s;e parti|cular
Heads of Inquiry, in which we have not &s;o much proceeded according
to the Nature of the things them&s;elves, as according to their Appearance or
Re&s;pect to us: For though the Earth, in Compari&s;on of the Heavens, be as it
were a Point, yet in Relation to its Nearne&s;s and Sen&s;iblene&s;s to us, it becomes
much more con&s;iderable, and the Con&s;ideration of it and its Parts will take up
the greate&s;t Part of this Hi&s;tory. We will divide the Subject of Philo&s;ophical
Hi&s;tory into two Parts; to wit, into things Natural and things Artificial.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="56">
Natural things may according to their Re&s;pects to us, be di&s;tingui&s;hed into
containing or cotain'd Bodies; the great containing Body we call Aether, in this
may be con&s;ider'd either its Magnitude and Figure; or its Parts: Or its Mo|tions:
Or its Mixtures: Or the things contain'd by it. These la&s;t are either
Comets, or Planets, or Stars, the Planets we yet know of are either Primary
or Secundary; the Primary are the&s;e &Merc;, &Venus;, the Earth, &Mars;, &Jupit;, &Saturn;, the Secun|dary
are the Moon, the Satellites of &Jupit; the Lunal of <HI>Saturn.</HI> All the&s;e, &s;aving
the Earth, being remov'd much out of reach, may be compriz'd under one only
Head; but of the Earth being nearer to us, we may con&s;ider its Parts. By the Earth
I under&s;tand, all the Bodies contain'd within the Compa&s;s of the Atmo&s;phere:
In the Atmo&s;phere therefore being that which contains the re&s;t, we may con&s;ider
either its Figure Extent, its Parts its Mixtures, its Motions, the things it con|tains:
The&s;e la&s;t are either greater or le&s;s, the greater are the two great Ma&s;&s;es of
Body, of which the Earth is made up, Namely, Water and Earth; the le&s;&s;er are
Animals. Animals are In&s;ects, Birds, Bea&s;ts, Men: In the Water we may
con&s;ider either its Figure and Extent, its Parts, its Mixtures, its Motions. The
things contain'd, the&s;e, are either Vegetables or Animals; Vegetables &s;ofter,
and &s;tony Animals, In&s;ects, Fi&s;hes, Bea&s;ts. In the Earth we may con&s;ider its
Magnitude and Figure, its Parts, its Mixtures, its Motions, the things it con|tains;
the&s;e may be Metals. Plants, Mu&s;hrooms, Mo&s;&s;es, Herbs, Shrubs,
Trees, from which Con&s;ideration of the Matters of which Hi&s;tory is to be writ|ten,
might be collected Tables or Heads for Inquiry; but becau&s;e the&s;e might
&s;eem Dogmatical, and thereby be offen&s;ive to &s;ome, and might &s;eem to &s;avour

a De&s;cription of the things them&s;elves, whereby Inqui&s;itive Per&s;ons that are
ignorant of them, may come to a more perfect Knowledge of them; in order to &s;ome other
De&s;ign as for Curio&s;ity, or Di&s;cour&s;e, or Profit, and Gain, or
the like: Or &s;uch a De&s;cription of them as is only in order to the U&s;e of Philo|&s;ophical
Inquiry, for the Invention of Cau&s;es, and for the finding out the ways
and means Nature u&s;es, and the Laws by which &s;he is re&s;train'd in producing
divers Effects.</P>
<P>And this la&s;t is that which is chiefly aim'd at in this De&s;ign (though others
al&s;o who&s;e Inten&s;ions are only of the former kind, may find much to &s;atisfy
<PB N="27" REF="61">
their De&s;ires) for the&s;e being known and applied, not only the Rea&s;ons of the
ways already made u&s;e of in &s;everal Trades might be ea&s;ily known: But each
of them highly amended and improved, and by other ways performed with
much more Ea&s;e, Speed and Certainty.</P>
<P>In the Hi&s;tory therefore of Trades, we are chiefly to look after the Phy&s;ical
Proprieties of each, as what is hard or &s;oft, what flexible or &s;tiff, what &s;harp,
corro&s;ive, what odoriferous, bal&s;amick and pre&s;ervative, what putrifactive and
corruptive, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> together with the manner of applying Agents to Patients, and
to ob&s;erve the manner of Natures proceeding, where &s;he is impos'd on by Art,
and limited to this or that Degree, and not &s;uffer'd to act otherwi&s;e, by what
Ways &s;he may be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, accelerated, regarded, &s;topt; and the like, in her
u&s;ual Proceedings; for the&s;e being known, mo&s;t of the other things will be
very ea&s;y and follow of cour&s;e. We ought al&s;o, to take notice of the various
&s;orts of Mechanical Engines, which &s;erve to a&s;&s;i&s;t and direct the hand in per|forming
may Operations together, with Ea&s;e and Speed and certainty: which
are not otherwi&s;e done without much Uncertainty, Time, and Difficulty; and
of the &s;everal Slights and Contrivances in Operations, and the order of them,
which precede and which follow, and the Efficaciou&s;ne&s;s of them in this or
that Method.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Trades I have been mentioning, there are many excellent Ex|periments
and Secrets to be found &s;cattered up and down in Mens Practi&s;es,
which have not come up to that Con&s;iderablene&s;s in the Commonwealth as to
be made a Trade, which yet contain in them divers Circum&s;tances of very ex|cellent
U&s;e and Information, tho&s;e al&s;o ought to be &s;ought out and collected and
rang'd into their proper Places, if at lea&s;t they can properly be referr'd to any of the
foregoing Heads, otherwi&s;e they are to make a particular Head of them&s;elves:
Of this kind there are a multitude almo&s;t in all E&s;tates and Conditions of Men,
which to this De&s;ign will be of huge Importance, and will afford very much
Information, even out of the mo&s;t vile and &s;eemingly mo&s;t fooli&s;h and trivial
things, and of tho&s;e which are mo&s;t common, and therefore pa&s;s without regard,
becau&s;e u&s;ual, may be collected things of mo&s;t excellent U&s;e; and therefore,
nothing in this De&s;ign is to be look'd on with the Eye of the Vulgar, and with
Prejudice, according to the E&s;teem it has obtain'd in the World with the Gene|rality
of Men, who generally judge or e&s;teem of things only for the immediate
Plea&s;ure or Profit they afford, and look no further; therefore 'tis not equal to
make their E&s;teem who under&s;tand them, the Standard of the value of things
for this u&s;e. So that a diligent Naturali&s;t can go no-where, but he may find a
Subject for him to contemplate and examine, but e&s;pecially in &s;uch Places as
are mo&s;t or lea&s;t frequented, for the Obviou&s;ne&s;s in the one, and Difficulty in
the other, has made Multitudes of con&s;iderable Ob&s;ervations to be neg|lected.</P>
<P>Having thus cur&s;orily &s;umm'd up the chief Heads of tho&s;e things that are fit
to be the Subject of Natural Hi&s;tory,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>&sect; III.</HI> The Mo|thods of ma|king the En|quiries.</NOTE> I &s;hall next adjoyn a Specimen of what
things are to be inquired after in them, that &s;o any other that &s;hall have an
Opportunity, and willing to promote this De&s;ign, may accordingly, whatever
the thing be he de&s;igns to write a Hi&s;tory of, fir&s;t propound to him&s;elf the
things, which upon a &s;erious Con&s;ideration of the Matter, he &s;hall judge to be
mo&s;t likely to be in&s;tructive for the di&s;covering of the true Nature of that
which he inquires into.</P>
<P>For it cannot be expected, that any one &s;hould be alike able to make Queries
of tho&s;e things in which he has not been much, if at all conver&s;ant; as one that
has had an Opportunity of acquainting him&s;elf more particularly with the Na|ture
of it, and has imbib'd in (though he knows not how) a great deal of im|perfect
Knowledge of the Proprieties of it. He ought therefore to con&s;ider
with him&s;elf, what things there are in the Subject he would inquire into, which
being told him, he &s;hould be able to know the true Propriety, Nature and
Texture of it: And &s;uppo&s;ing he had met with &s;ome one that could re&s;olve
him, what Que&s;tions he would ask him, by the Re&s;olution of which he &s;hould
be able to find out what he &s;eeks; and accordingly he ought to &s;et down tho&s;e
Que&s;tions in Writing, that &s;o he may have a Scheme before his Eyes what are
the things he looks after, what his Scope and Aim is.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="62">
And having &s;et down the&s;e Queries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of an|&s;wering the Queries.</NOTE> he ought in the next place to con&s;ider what
things &s;eem requi&s;ite to attain tho&s;e ends; what means he can imagine may be
conducive to the &s;olving or an&s;wering tho&s;e Que&s;tions, that is, what Ob&s;ervations,
Examinations, or Experiments would &s;eem conducive thereunto, and accordingly
under every &s;uch Query or Que&s;tion, he ought to &s;et down the things requi&s;ite to
be known for the obtaining the full Knowledge of a compleat and full An&s;wer to
it; afterwards with Care and Diligence he ought to make Examination and Try|al
of what he has propounded, one thing after another, with much Circum&s;pection,
for accordingly as the&s;e Queries are made with more or le&s;s Judgment, and as
the means conducive to the Re&s;olution of them are more judiciou&s;ly pitcht on,
and diligently try'd more or le&s;s con&s;iderable, &s;o will the Particulars to be en|tred
in the Diary be; and the more or le&s;s u&s;eful for a Philo&s;ophical Trea&s;ury.
In the making of which Experiments and Tryals, it were very de&s;irable that the
Inquirer would fir&s;t make Tryal of them once all over, and ob&s;erve diligently
and enter into a Paper by them&s;elves as many Particulars as he can di&s;cover
worth noting, and then a &s;econd time to make them over again. In the doing
of which, it would be very convenient to get &s;ome &s;uch Per&s;on to be pre&s;ent
as has not been acquainted with Experiments on that Subject, though ingenious
and inqui&s;itive in other Phy&s;ical Searches, because &s;uch a Per&s;on may take no|tice
of many Particulars which are in them&s;elves very ob&s;ervable, but were and
would &s;till have been neglected becau&s;e of their being obvious, and becau&s;e the
Inquirer having been long accu&s;tomed to the &s;eeing of them without thinking
them any ways con&s;iderable, will be now very prone to do as formerly, &s;light
and neglect them, and this will be in&s;tructive to him in &s;hewing him in
what things he is mo&s;t likely to be over&s;een in, as well as &s;hewing him the
things them&s;elves. The Tryal of the&s;e Experiments, 'tis very likely, will much
further his Knowledge, and &s;hew him perhaps the Solution of &s;ome of his
Queries, as well as the Error and In&s;ignificancy of others; and may perhaps
much better in&s;truct him how to make his &s;econd Cla&s;s of Queries, and how
to proceed in the &s;olving and an&s;wering them, they will not only facilitate the
Labour of making and accu&s;tome his Mind to a greater Circum&s;pection, but
will &s;ugge&s;t al&s;o various ways of examining and experimenting, which without
this Method of inquiring would not have been thought of.</P>
<P>And though indeed the Multitude of Queries that may be made upon every
Subject, may &s;eem to make this Work infinite and impo&s;&s;ible to be completed,
yet if Men would but pro&s;ecute thoroughly, according to the ways I propound
in this Tract, &s;uch kind of Inquiries in order to the Di&s;coveries of the Pro|prieties
of &s;ome Bodies, or for finding out the Nature of &s;ome general Qualities.
I cannot doubt but that &s;uch Endeavours would produce &s;o con&s;iderable Di&s;co|veries,
as would not only &s;erve for the Explication of that one Body inquir'd
into, but of Multitudes of Bodies of the like Nature; and every &s;uch Inven|tion
will ea&s;e the Inquiries in mo&s;t other Bodies, half in half, after the &s;ame
Propriety. As to give an In&s;tance propounding to my &s;elf to find out the Rea|&s;on
of the Lightne&s;s of Cork.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Example of the Method.</NOTE> I &s;et down among other ways of Tryal to exa|mine
the Texture of it with a good Micro&s;cope, hoping that po&s;&s;ibly I might
thereby be able to di&s;cover its Texture, to this end I examin'd &s;everal Pieces of
Cork, who&s;e &s;ides I had cut very &s;mooth with a Razor, but the glaring Refle|ction
from the Multitude of &s;ides that compo&s;e its Surface made me unable,
though I try'd it in &s;everal Lights to di&s;cern any kind of Pores, I bethought
me therefore of &s;having off a very thin Sliver of Cork, and laying it on a black
Ground, I could with my Micro&s;cope then plainly perceive the Texture of its
Sub&s;tance, that it was as porous as a Honey-comb; that is, all over full of
&s;mall long Pores, upon and down, through the length of which were inter|&s;pers'd
many cro&s;s Diaphragms, or Valves, by which means the Air is impri|&s;on'd
in very curious clo&s;e Boxes. Finding the&s;e in Cork, I proceeded to find
the &s;ame in Wood, not doubting but the Lightne&s;s of that might proceed from
&s;ome &s;uch Cau&s;e, I made tryal with Wood both green and dry, &s;hav'd after the
&s;ame way, but in green Wood it &s;ucceeded not at all, but I could perceive di|vers
larger up and down the dry. I conceived therefore, that it might be the
Juice of the Plant which had fill'd tho&s;e Holes, and therefore con&s;idering that in
<PB N="29" REF="63">
Charcole all that &s;uperfluous Juice is wa&s;ted, and evaporated, I made tryal of
viewing a Coal in a Micro&s;cope, and even beyond my Expectation, I could di&s;|cover
&s;uch Multitudes of them and &s;o &s;mall, that I could hardly at fir&s;t believe
my own Eyes, till trying the Experiment over and over again, I found the &s;ame
Propriety was not only to be found in one or two other kinds of Wood, but
was common to all &s;orts of Vegetables that I was able to charr.</P>
<P>Thus the Experiment of <HI>Saccharum Saturni,</HI> by di&s;&s;olving Lead in an acid Li|quor,
and evaporating away the watery part, will hint to us a way of di&s;co|vering
the Ta&s;tes of all kinds of Bodies; that is, by di&s;&s;olving tho&s;e re&s;erved
and ta&s;tele&s;s Bodies, in &s;ome convenient <HI>Men&s;truum,</HI> for being once di&s;&s;olv'd,
it becomes di&s;&s;oluble al&s;o, by the Vehicle of that <HI>Men&s;truum,</HI> to the <HI>Saliva</HI> or
Juice in the Mouth, or Tongue which &s;eems to be the Organ of Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Thus the finding out the Cau&s;e of Fluidity, Heat, Gravity, Brittlene&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in
one Body, will much facilitate the Inquiry after the like Properties in any other
Body, &s;o that though indeed upon every &s;pecifick Body to be examin'd, there
may be a Multitude of Queries propounded, yet the more praeceeding Bodies
have been by this Method examin'd, the fewer of them will there remain to
be an&s;wer'd.</P>

that are con&s;iderable at the time when they are mo&s;t requi&s;ite. By this
Method al&s;o the imperfections of Hi&s;tory will be amended. And tho' indeed
this Proce&s;s of Rea&s;oning and Inquiry may &s;eem nothing el&s;e but what every
Man would do, and does indeed continually practi&s;e in all kinds of Inquiry:
Yet has it this va&s;t Advantage above the common way, where the bare Powers
of the Sen&s;es, Memory and Under&s;tanding are relied upon, that it perfects
the&s;e Faculties to the highe&s;t pitch they are capable of, and that is indeed as

Intention of the Mind bent wholly to its Work, without being any other ways
at the &s;ame time imployed in the Drudgery and Slavery of the Memory, either
in calling particular things to Memory, or ranging them in Order, or remem|bring

fa&s;t as made.</P>
<P>Next it is not trouble&s;ome to find what thing is to be done in the next place,
the way of proceeding is chalked out, nor will the Mind be much troubled to
run over all the particular In&s;tances and Heads of Inquiry, they are all pre|&s;ented
at once to the View: Their Order, Congruity, Di&s;agreement, Simili|tude,

<P>The la&s;t thing therefore is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The means of Collecting Ob|&s;ervations.</NOTE> to con&s;ider of the means of collecting Ob&s;erva|tions,

either Negatively or Affirmatively, either in part or totally, from whence the&s;e
Materials are to be collected, and by what means? For according to the choice

therefore wherein Nature is as 'twere put to Shifts and forc'd to confe&s;s, ei|ther
directly or indirectly the Truth of what we inquire are the be&s;t if they

<P>By the&s;e means are to be &s;earched out the Properties of Bodies, whereof the
Hi&s;tory is to be written, and where we can find no farther ways of proceeding
to deeper Searches, and Nature &s;eems to leave us in the Lurch, or pa&s;s away by
un&s;een Paths, there ought to be &s;et up as it were a Land-mark
to direct us where to begin again to &s;earch, if making Tryal in one way we find our &s;elves
mi&s;taken, and thus we may a &s;econd or third if po&s;&s;ibly we can by any means
light upon &s;uch Experiments or Ob&s;ervations, as may inable us to gue&s;s which
way &s;he was mo&s;t likely to take; but if upon Tryal we find it to be a bu&s;ine&s;s
of much greater Difficulty, the Progre&s;s how far we have gone is to be regi|&s;tered,
and the <HI>non ultra</HI> together with it, and &s;o that kind of Inquiry may be
laid by for a time, till &s;omewhat more of the &s;ecret Workings of Nature are
learnt from &s;ome other Pro&s;ecutions of her, in other ways, for Nature is &s;o ve|ry
&s;ubtle and re&s;erved, that there will need a very great Stock of Patience as
well as Skill to be able to di&s;cover her Paths and Methods.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An in&s;tance in the Cau&s;e of Expan&s;ion.</NOTE> As in inquiring
after the Adequate Cau&s;e of Expan&s;ion, we find that mo&s;t Bodies as well
fluid as &s;olid, Metals, Quick-&s;ilver, Stones, Gla&s;s, Water, Spirit of Wine,
Oyle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are expanded by Heat, but finding al&s;o that the contrary Quality to
Heat, Namely, inten&s;e Cold does produce the &s;ame Effect as that Water fro|zen
into Ice is more rarified than the Water: We are here at a lo&s;s to find what
way Nature &s;hould take with two quite contrary Agents, to bring forth the
&s;ame Effect, here therefore we &s;et up a Mark, and make an Attempt to find
what way Expan&s;ion is perform'd by Cold, we find that mo&s;t Ice when exa|min'd
is all over be&s;prinkled with di&s;&s;eminated Bubbles; till we have traced
Nature a little farther, we inquire therefore, whether Nature has not taken
that way of rarifying that Body, but we may find that even tho&s;e pieces of Ice
which through the be&s;t Micro&s;cope is perfectly clear and free from tho&s;e &s;mall
Bubbles, has a greater Expan&s;ion than the Water out of which it was frozen,
becau&s;e it will &s;wim in it, and next becau&s;e that the Refraction. of Ice is le&s;s
than the Refraction of Water. This la&s;t &s;eems to hint that Nature has taken
this way of making Ice lighter than the common Water, by precipitating a
gro&s;&s;er or heavier part of the Water to the Bottom, and by collecting the ligh|ter
and more rarify'd Parts and freezing them, as may be in part ob&s;erved in
the freezing Salt Water; but that neither is this the way that Nature has at|tempted,
this Experiment will &s;atisfy us, that taking two clear pieces of Ice,
and &s;uffering one of them to thaw and the other to remain frozen, the Ice will
&s;till &s;wim upon the Water, whence 'tis evident that the Water is the &s;ame as
to Weight. Be&s;ides we find that the whole Bulk is expanded, and not the
frozen part made lighter and the unfrozen heavier; for we find it to break the
containing Ve&s;&s;el if it be &s;uch as will not freely give it room to expand; &s;o
that we mu&s;t here &s;et up a re&s;t, till we may come to the Knowledge of it

deeper parts of Inquiry. But we are not here to &s;tay; for this, like the Knowledge
of Letters, without knowing how to &s;pell with them, or u&s;e them, is little worth;
for our Sen&s;es are of &s;uch a Con&s;titution, that they are very apt to mi&s;lead us
in tho&s;e things where their Power reaches, and in many things they leave us
without being able farther to a&s;&s;i&s;t us.</P>
<P>The Defects therefore being naturally two,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Article 2d. By the Sen&s;es hel|ped and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed.</NOTE> we ought to provide again&s;t
them with two Artificial Helps; fir&s;t, for the more certain determining and
defining the Sen&s;ations, and reducing them to a Standard, and next for the
Di&s;covery of tho&s;e &s;en&s;ible Properties in Bodies, which our Sen&s;es are not able
to reach, and defining them al&s;o.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t. Reducing Sen&s;ation to a Standard.</NOTE> For the exact determining and defining of the Quality or Degree of the
Proprieties, Powers, and Affections of Bodies, we ought to provide &s;uch In|&s;truments
or Standards, as may be capable of receiving all Degrees whereof
that Propriety is capable, after which Search is made: That &s;o by making the
Standard receive the &s;ame Degree of the Propriety with that in the Body to be
mea&s;ur'd, the Divi&s;ion of the Standard may give the determinate Quantity or
Degree, whether the Inquiry be after the Quantity of its Exten&s;ion, Time, Mo|tion,
Action, or Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Secondly, For di&s;tingui&s;hing the Quality of &s;ome of them in an&s;wer to what kind,
of this or that general Propriety they belong to; there ought to be peculiar Contri|vances
that &s;o every thing may bemore exactly defin'd, and nothing may be left to
the unaccurate and ca&s;ual Information of the Sen&s;es, but that every thing that
is taken into Philo&s;ophical Hi&s;tory, may be capable of being accurately determin'd
by In&s;truments. Now though it be very difficult to determine exactly in all; there
being &s;ome of them, &s;uch as the Smells and Ta&s;tes of Bodies, which never have
been brought to any kind of Theory, and of which therefore we have &s;o very
Imperfect Notions that we have not words for many, and even tho&s;e Names we
have are very ambiguous and determine little, yet 'tis not impo&s;&s;ible but that
even the&s;e al&s;o may be reduc'd to a Theory and Standard; for the Variety of
Colours is not le&s;s than the Varieties of Ta&s;tes and Smells; and yet 'tis not
difficult to derive them all from two Heads, and the Degrees of them; name|ly,
from the Degrees of Yellow, and the Degrees of Blew, and from the In|terpo&s;ure
of White or much Reflection, and Dark or little Reflection: For all
the Colours in the World are made up of the Mixtures of &s;ome of the&s;e De|grees,
with the Intermixtures of White and Black, which make them only ap|pear
more faint or foul. And it &s;eems not improbable al&s;o, but that with Di|ligence
there might be found out &s;uch a Theory of Ta&s;tes and Smells, as that
from the Mixture of &s;ome few with their Gradations, might be explain'd all
the Ta&s;tes and Smells in the World. The well determining of which Inquiry,
&s;eems to be likely to afford us as great A&s;&s;i&s;tance towards the Di&s;covery of the
Nature and Con&s;titutions of Bodies, as to their Medicinal U&s;e, as any way
imaginable. Now though this nice di&s;tingui&s;hing and defining the Degrees of
&s;ome things be very nece&s;&s;ary, yet in other things it is often times needle&s;s and
<PB N="37" REF="71">
in&s;ignificant, for in &s;uch things wherein Nature does not ob&s;erve &s;uch Nicety
in making u&s;e of this or that peculiar Degree or Mixture, but &s;eems indifferent
to all; in &s;uch things the di&s;tingui&s;hing that Propriety in any one particular
on which Experiment or Ob&s;ervation is made, will rather be prejudicial than
a&s;&s;i&s;tant in di&s;covering the Nature in general, but in other things where Nature
&s;eems to be bounded, and to act by a certain Method, and to keep within &s;uch
Limits, in tho&s;e the Limits and Bounds are to be ob&s;erved, as in ob&s;erving the
Colour of any Terre&s;trial Animal: 'Tis not very material to define exactly
what Colour it is of, becau&s;e we find Nature u&s;es a Latitude; only this may be
noted, that though the Colours of Terre&s;trial Animals of the &s;ame Species are
often very various, intermixt with White and Black, and no one Colour per|fectly
clear or bright is to be found among&s;t them, yet in the Colours of Birds
there are indeed to be found all Varieties of Mixtures, but generally the Colour
is &s;omewhat more fixt to the Species, and the mo&s;t of them more clear and
orient: Which la&s;t does di&s;cover &s;omewhat of Di&s;tinction between the Parts
and Sub&s;tance of Hair and tho&s;e of Feathers, namely, that the Parts of Feathers
are far more clear and &s;mall, than tho&s;e of Hair, and con&s;equently 'tis not im|probable,
but that the con&s;tituent Parts may be more porous, defecated and fine.
So likewi&s;e the Bounds of Heat, between which Nature has confin'd it &s;elf for
proportioning the Animal and Vegetable Life, and beyond either of which Life
cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, are to be as exactly ob&s;erv'd as can be defin'd, but the peculiar
Warmth of this or that Animal is not &s;o nice: So likewi&s;e for Gravity the
lighte&s;t and heavie&s;t Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral Sub&s;tance, and &s;o for the
re&s;t.</P>
<P>In other things where the exact Degree is very nece&s;&s;ary and Fundamental to
the Con&s;titution of the Body, in that ca&s;e the greater Diligence and Skill is
u&s;ed in the determining of it the better. Thus in determining the Specifick
Weight, Den&s;ity, Colour, Malleablene&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Gold, or any of the other
Metals: The more exact the Experiments are, the greater Information we re|ceive
from them of the Nature of tho&s;e Bodies.</P>
<P>For the making of the&s;e Standards and Mea&s;ures, to determine the various
Degrees of &s;everal Proprieties, there may be divers Contrivances for each pe|culiar
Property, and &s;ome of them more fit, convenient, and exact than others.
The Degrees of Light may be determin'd by Compari&s;on to the Light of a Can|dle,
of a determinate Bigne&s;s, plac'd in a long dark Room or Gallery, and by
examining the thining Body at &s;everal Di&s;tances from that Light; as &s;uppo&s;e
the Light or Shining of a Gloworm be to be determin'd in &s;uch a dark. Vault,
I try at &s;everal Di&s;tances from the Candle whereabout the Light begins to be
vi&s;ible; in departing from the Candle, and whereabout it begins to di&s;appear
in approaching towards it, and that Place I mark for the Degree of the Light
of Gloworms; by the like Method I try the Light of rotten Wood, decaying
Fi&s;h, Diamonds, heated Metals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The ways of determining Colours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;ervation 9th. and 10th.</NOTE> many skilful Painters and Dyers know
very well without In&s;truments, but by one not &s;o skill'd, they may be defin'd
by a way I have mention'd in my Micography, which I therefore now omit
to repeat.</P>
<P>The Acutene&s;s and Loudne&s;s of Sounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Time of la&s;ting, Velocity of Pro|pagation, grea|te&s;t Di&s;tance of Exten&s;ion.</NOTE> and Sonorou&s;ne&s;s of Bodies, may be
ea&s;ily enough mea&s;ur'd by a &s;ound Pipe of a determinate Bigne&s;s, and by the
Strength of the Bla&s;t that is given by poi&s;ed Bellows to blow it, other more
loud Sounds may be determin'd al&s;o by &s;hooting &s;mall Guns with various
Charges, or by the Di&s;tance they can be heard, and the like.</P>
<P>Smells and Ta&s;tes being not yet reduc'd cannot be &s;o exactly mea&s;ur'd and
defin'd, but they may be &s;omewhat determin'd, by comparing them to the
Smells and Ta&s;tes of Bodies that are mo&s;t common.</P>
<P>Heat and Cold may be many ways di&s;cover'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Di&s;tance and Velocity of Propagation, the Cold Air from Snowy Clouds.</NOTE> by Weather-Gla&s;&s;es and Ther|mometers
of &s;everal kinds; the way of making and determining which, I have
&s;hewn in my Micrography, or el&s;e by Burning-Gla&s;&s;es, together with the help
of the Thermometers: For if a Burning-Gla&s;s of a known Number of Inches
in Diameter be able to melt Gold, and Iron, and Copper, and Stones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in &s;uch
a determinate Quantity of Time; and that the Reflection from a part of it be
able to rai&s;e the Standard to &s;uch a Degree, it follows, that thereby all De|grees
<PB N="38" REF="72">
of Heat may be ea&s;ily determin'd; as &s;uppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, it be de&s;ired
to determine the Degree of the Heat of the Flame of a Lamp, intended by a
&s;trong Bla&s;t, we find that &s;uch a blown Flame is capable of heating Gla&s;s Red
hot, and melting it in &s;uch a &s;pace of time.</P>
<P>To reduce it therefore to the Standard, 'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee what Aperture of the
Burning Gla&s;s will produce the &s;ame Effect in the &s;ame time, and what Aper|ture
at the &s;ame time (for this is very nece&s;&s;ary to be known) will rai&s;e the
Thermometer to &s;uch a Degree. The Degrees of Cold al&s;o may be ea&s;ily deter|min'd
by the Thermometer, as I have el&s;ewhere &s;hewn.</P>
<P>The Degrees of Dryne&s;s and Moi&s;ture in the Air, and &s;ometimes al&s;o in
other Bodies, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Hygro&s;cope, of which I have ex|plain'd
the way of making and u&s;ing in my Micrography. Stiffne&s;s and Pliable|ne&s;s,
Toughne&s;s and Brittleness, are &s;ufficiently obvious, by comparing them
to the Pliablene&s;s or Stiffne&s;s of pieces of unhardned Iron of peculiar Bigne&s;&s;es
and Shapes, and to the Toughne&s;s of Wire of a determinate Bigne&s;s: Now
though in all the&s;e things we cannot come to a Mathematical Exactne&s;s, yet it
will be &s;ufficient if we come as near to the Truth as the Matter is capable of;
fox we find that Nature it &s;elf does not &s;o exactly determine its Operations, but
allows a Latitude almo&s;t to all its Workings, though as I &s;aid before, it &s;eems
to be re&s;train'd within certain Limits, and beyond tho&s;e is neither exce&s;&s;ive on
the one hand or defective on the other.</P>
<P>The Specifick Gravity of Bodies may be determin'd by weighing in Water.</P>
<P>There are as many various ways al&s;o of determining all the other Proprieties,
and reducing them to a Certainty or Standard, but the&s;e may &s;uffice for an In|&s;tance,
to &s;hew what I mean by the determining the Degrees of the Proprieties
in &s;everal Objects.</P>
<P>As for the determining of the Figure, Number, Motion, Velocity, Power,
Time, and the like, the ways are &s;ufficiently ea&s;y, and the ingenious Inquirer
will upon the occa&s;ion, find various Contrivances to determine them.</P>
<P>The &s;econd way of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Sen&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2dly, By help|ing the Sen&s;es to di&s;cover what una&s;&s;i&s;ted they could not, &amp;c.</NOTE> is either fir&s;t by enlarging their Power,
or Sphere of Activity, and extending it much farther than that a&s;&s;ign'd them
by Nature; or el&s;e &s;econdly, by reducing other things to &s;uch a Con&s;titution,
as to bring them within the Power of the Sen&s;e. For the Performance of each
of which there are various means to be u&s;ed.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t. By enlarge|ing their Power.</NOTE> for the enlarging the Power of the Sen&s;e, and making it capable of
&s;en&s;ating many things, which without tho&s;e Helps would not have been di&s;|cerned
or fallen within the reach of tho&s;e Sen&s;es; of the&s;e there may be many
for the a&s;&s;i&s;ting of every Sen&s;e, but &s;ome of them have been more cultivated
than others, and brought to a much greater Perfection, but yet not to the high|e&s;t
pitch they &s;eem capable of, but they are every day more and more improv'd,
and it may be hoped, that this Age may produce the perfecting of &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>Of this kind are Micro&s;copes and Tele&s;copes for the Sight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As for the Sight Micro|&s;copes and Te|le&s;copes.</NOTE> the one for di&s;|covering
the Figure and Magnitude of the &s;mall Parts of &s;uch Bodies as are
within our reach, the other for detecting the Figures and Magnitude of &s;uch
Bodies as are by the Greatne&s;s of their Di&s;tance, reduc'd to &s;o &s;mall a vi&s;ible
Appearance as that the naked Eye is unable to di&s;tingui&s;h either their determi|nate
Bigne&s;s or their Figure, the&s;e may be Helps both of Invention and defining:
And as they are indeed the greate&s;t In&s;tance that can be given of the Improve|ment
of the Power of the Sen&s;es; So the perfecting of them is the mo&s;t likely
way to afford us the greate&s;t help for the Detection of the Nature of Bodies.
For the Eye is the mo&s;t Spiritual and mo&s;t capacious Sen&s;e we are endowed
with, it affords us the mo&s;t &s;udden, mo&s;t di&s;tinct and in&s;tructive Information of
all; with this we expatiate through the Univer&s;e, and pa&s;s from the one end to the
other in the twinkling of an Eye, by this we compare the Magnitude and Mea|&s;ure,
the Di&s;tances, Motions, and the Velocities of all tho&s;e va&s;t Bodies which
are di&s;&s;eminated up and down through it, and none of the other Sen&s;es tend &s;o
much to perfect the Imagination as this. Now whereas the Power of the Sight
in Di&s;covery was not able to di&s;tingui&s;h of Objects that appear'd to the Eye
under a le&s;s Angle than about a Minute, by the help of the&s;e it is able to di|&s;tinguish
&s;uch as would not appear bigger than a third. So that according to
<PB N="39" REF="73">
this Calculation, the Power of the Eye is increa&s;ed near 4000 times as much
more as it was before, and we are capable of di&s;covering things 4000 times
further off, and 4000 times nearer the Eye than we were without them. And
it &s;eems not improbable to me but that each of them may be improv'd &s;o far
as to inlarge that Power 4000 times 4000 times the fir&s;t Dimen&s;ion, e&s;pecially
in &s;uch Objects where the imperfect Tran&s;parency of the Medium, or the De|fect
of Light does not hinder this Effect as in things very near the Eye, or in
Objects very near the Zenith.</P>
<P>The Sen&s;e of Hearing does not altogether &s;o much in&s;truct as to the Nature
of things as the Eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hearing.</NOTE> though there are many Helps that this Sen&s;e would
afford by a greater Improvement, there may be a Po&s;&s;ibility that by Otocou&s;ti|cons
many Sounds very far di&s;tant (I had almo&s;t &s;aid as far off as &s;ome Pla|nets)
may be made &s;en&s;ible, at least the Noi&s;es of Thunder might be di&s;co|ver'd
at a much greater Di&s;tance than it can be by the Ear without the&s;e
Helps, and hereby perhaps the Variations and Changes of the Weather might
be predicted much longer before-hand than now they are, and Ships at Sea might
perhaps di&s;cover an Enemy of Weather coming by the Hearing, as well as they
can now di&s;cern an Enemy's Ship by the Sight. As for the hearing of Noi&s;es
made as far off as the Planets, I cannot, I confe&s;s, my &s;elf &s;o far throw off
Prejudice, as not to look on it as a very extravagant Conjecture, but yet me|thinks
I &s;hould have had the &s;ame Thoughts of a Conjecture to find out a Help
for the Eye to &s;ee the &s;maller Parts and Rocks of the Moon, and to di&s;cover
their Height and Shadow, before I had &s;een or known the excellent Contri|vance
of Tele&s;copes. And though methinks from what Experience I have had
of Sounds, I am apt to imagine them not capable of being propagated to &s;o
great a Di&s;tance; yet when I con&s;ider again, that by very ordinary and ca&s;ual
Tryals as it were, I have been able to hear Per&s;ons di&s;cour&s;e di&s;tinctly where
others in the &s;ame place have not heard any Noi&s;e or Whi&s;per, I would fain
per&s;wade my &s;elf again&s;t concluding or building on the Impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch
things as I am not able demon&s;trably to prove not po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>There may be al&s;o a Po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;covering the Internal Motions and A|ctions
of Bodies by the &s;ound they make,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Internal Motions of Bo|dies may be di&s;cover'd by Sound.</NOTE> who knows but that as in a Watch
we may hear the beating of the Balance, and the running of the Wheels, and
the &s;triking of the Hammers, and the grating of the Teeth, and Multitudes of
other Noi&s;es; who knows, I &s;ay, but that it may be po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover the
Motions of the Internal Parts of Bodies, whether Animal, Vegetable, or Mine|ral,
by the &s;ound they make, that one may di&s;cover the Works perform'd in
the &s;everals Offices and Shops of a Man's Body, and thereby di&s;cover what In|&s;trument
or Engine is out of order, what Works are going on at &s;everal Times,
and lies &s;till at others, and the like; that in Plants and Vegetables one might
di&s;cover by the Noi&s;e the Pumps for rai&s;ing the Juice, the Valves for &s;topping it,
and the ru&s;hing of it out of one Pa&s;&s;age into another, and the like. I could
proceed further, but methinks I can hardly forbear to blu&s;h, when I con&s;ider
how the mo&s;t part of Men will look upon this: But yet again, I have this In|couragement,
not to think all the&s;e things utterly impo&s;&s;ible, though never &s;o
much derided by the Generality of Men, and never &s;o &s;eemingly mad, fooli&s;h
and phanta&s;tick, that as the thinking them impo&s;&s;ible cannot much improve my
Knowledge, &s;o the believing them po&s;&s;ible may perhaps be an occa&s;ion of ta|king
notice of &s;uch things as another would pa&s;s by without regard as u&s;ele&s;s.
And &s;omewhat more of Incouragement I have al&s;o from Experience, that I have
been able to hear very plainly the beating of a Man's Heart, and 'tis common
to hear the Motion of Wind to and fro in the Guts, and other &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els,
the &s;topping of the Lungs is ea&s;ily di&s;cover'd by the Whee&s;ing, the Stopping of
the Head, by the humming and whi&s;tling Noi&s;es, the fliping to and fro of
the Joynts in many ca&s;es, by crackling, and the like; as to the working, or
Motion of the Parts one among&s;t another, methinks I could receive Incourage|ment
from hearing the hi&s;&s;ing noi&s;e made by a corro&s;ive Men&s;truum in its Ope|ration,
the Noi&s;e of Fire in di&s;&s;olving, of Water in boyling, of the Parts of a
Bell after that its Motion is grown quite invi&s;ible as to the Eye, for to me
the&s;e Motions and the other &s;eem only to differ <HI>&s;ecundum magis &amp; minus,</HI> and
&s;o to their becoming &s;en&s;ible they require either that their Motions be increa&s;ed,
<PB N="40" REF="74">
or that the Organ be made more nice and powerful to &s;en&s;ate and di&s;tingui&s;h
them [to try the Contrivance about an Artificial Timpanum] as they are, for
the doing of both which I think it not impo&s;&s;ible but that in many ca&s;es there
may be Helps found, &s;ome of which I may as Opportunity is offer'd make Try|al
of, which if &s;ucce&s;sful and u&s;eful, I &s;hall not conceal.</P>
<P>As for the Sen&s;e of Smelling,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smelling.</NOTE> though it has been le&s;s cultivated than that of
Hearing, and &s;eems to be of much le&s;s Extent, and to have much le&s;s Influence
upon our Knowledge than either of tho&s;e I have already mentioned, it being
only for the di&s;tingui&s;hing of the Effluvia and Fumes of Bodies, which are di&s;|&s;olv'd
by and fly upon and down the Air; yet if we con&s;ider the Nature of it
aright, we &s;hall find that it is capable of a much greater Degree. We find
that a Hound by this Sen&s;e is able for a good while after to di&s;cover where his
Game has pa&s;t, which po&s;&s;ibly may ari&s;e from the Steams or Efflux of its Body,
which per&s;piring through the Pores of the Skin, and coming into the Air are
ea&s;ily precipitated down upon the Track which the Creature has pa&s;t over, and
&s;o lie loo&s;e upon the upper Surface of if, and thereby they ea&s;ily touch the
No&s;e of the Hound, which in following his Game he u&s;ually either rubs over
the Gra&s;s, or Ground, or at lea&s;t lays it &s;o very near, that with drawing in the
Breath at his No&s;e, by &s;trongly &s;niffing; the Volatile Salt, which is in the Ef|fluvia
of all Animals is ea&s;ily rais'd and drawn in with the Air, and that Sen&s;e
being very acute in this Creature, it ea&s;ily perceives the &s;mallest Impre&s;&s;ion
on it.</P>
<P>There may be multitudes of ways of a&s;&s;i&s;ting this Sen&s;e, &s;ome of which I
have already hinted in the Preface of my Micrography, as I have al&s;o concerning
&s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tances that may be thought of for the helping of the Sen&s;es, of Ta&s;t|ing
and Feeling, which may &s;erve as a Specimen or Example to &s;hew what my
meaning is in this Particular.</P>
<P>The Second way therefore of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Sen&s;es in Di&s;covery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2dly, By ma|king the &s;en&s;i|ble Qualities in the Object more powerful.</NOTE> is by making
the &s;en&s;ible Qualities of the Object more powerful than naturally they are of
them&s;elves for affecting the Sen&s;e, or more proportionate to the Power and Fa|culties
of them. This may be various ways performed according to the parti|cular
Nature of the Objects that are disproportion'd to the Sen&s;ory. For</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1">First, Some are quite ob&s;cur'd and buried in the matter, &s;o as not at all to
affect the Sen&s;e, the&s;e therefore will need to be excited and made active and
vigorous by Art; thus the Ta&s;tes of Metals and divers other Bodies are di&s;co|ver'd,
by opening and loo&s;ing the Bodies of them with appropriate Men&s;tru|ums;
thus the Light of a Diamond is made vi&s;ible by rubbing, The Inky Black
Colours of Galls, or the Juice of Oak is made vi&s;ible by mixing Coperas, The
Sound of a Bell is di&s;cover'd by &s;triking it, the Smell of Sal-Armoniack is freed
by mixing Quick Lime, the biting Smell of Mu&s;tard-Seed is freed by brui&s;ing
and grinding. The internal Heat of Corro&s;ive Men&s;truums is made &s;en&s;ible by
mixing di&s;&s;oluble Bodies with them, the Gravity of the Air is manife&s;ted by
being weighed in an evacuated Ve&s;&s;el, the Greene&s;s of Gold is di&s;cover'd by be|ing
beaten very thin, the Greene&s;s and Bluene&s;s of Copper by Di&s;&s;olution, the
Salt of Vegetables by calcining, and Multitudes of the like.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2">Secondly, Some are very languid and weak, and so affect the Sen&s;e to which
they are appropriated &s;o very little that they are hardly di&s;cernible, &s;uch as
the&s;e therefore will need to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Art, and to be made more vigorous
and powerful. Thus the Heat in the Air or Sun Beams, in the colde&s;t time of
Winter, is hardly &s;en&s;ible to the touch; but if the Rays be united by a Burning-Gla&s;s,
they will not only be able to warm, but al&s;o to burn the Finger; thus
when the Air has very few Effluvia in it of an odorous Body, &s;o that we can
hardly &s;mell them, if drawing in the Breath through the No&s;tril we make a
great Quantity of that Air pa&s;s through it, tho&s;e few that are collected and
united out of the Air by this means become &s;en&s;ible. Thus the Smells of many
other Bodies are &s;o languid and faint, that they are hardly di&s;cernable without
being either heated or rubb'd, the Flexibility of Gla&s;s is manife&s;ted by drawing
it out into very &s;mall Threads. Thirdly, many things become in&s;en&s;ible from
their Slowne&s;s, the&s;e ought either to be accelerated or to be &s;ought after by
<PB N="41" REF="75">
other means which I &s;hall &s;hew in the third way of acquiring Information of
the Effects of Nature. If they are &s;uch things as are within our Power to pro|mote,
their Motions are to be accelerated and promoted either really or in Ap|pearance;
thus &s;uppo&s;ing the Experiment were true that &s;ome Authors have de|livered
to us concerning the Acceleration of Sallets, we might po&s;&s;ibly be able to
&s;ee the Motion of Vegetation, as we might al&s;o, if that Story be true which <HI>Clu&s;ius</HI>
tells us, of the &s;trangely growing and ri&s;ing Tree; thus the Motion of the Hand
of a Watch may be &s;een by making it go fa&s;ter: As to the making them ap|pear
&s;o though they really are not accelerated, this is done by the Tele&s;cope
for the Caele&s;tial Bodies, for by the help of long ones of that kind, the Mo|tion
of the Sun and Stars is almo&s;t as plain as that of a Bowl, the like is done
al&s;o by viewing the Shadow of the Sun when ca&s;t on the Ground, or a Wall, by
a Body at a great Di&s;tance from the &s;hadowing Body.</P>
<P>Thus al&s;o the Sound of a String very &s;lackly &s;train'd is not to be heard, but
by being &s;train'd harder it yields a very brisk Sound. Iron heated to one De|gree
of Heat has not acquired Motion enough to make it &s;hine, but if farther
wrought on and agitated by Heat, it &s;hines very bright and clear.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Some Objects are too &s;trong, and &s;o the Sen&s;e is not able to indure<MILESTONE N="3">
the examining of them: In this ca&s;e, the vigorous Influence of them on the Sen|&s;ory
is to be abated; thus the Body of the Sun is &s;o bright as to be able to de|&s;troy
the Sight, but if it be veil'd with a Fog or Cloud, or the Sight be veil'd by
a deep colour'd Gla&s;s, or a &s;mall Aperture, or the Reflection of it be view'd in a
Bucket of Water, the Eye may without much Trouble behold and view it. Thus
the burning and corro&s;ive Liquor of Oyl of Vitriol, or the like, which would
burn the Mouth and &s;poil the Sen&s;ory, when allay'd by the Mixture of much
fair Water, becomes a very plea&s;ant Ta&s;te, and &s;uited well enough to the Or|gan.
Thus the Sound of Bells in a Steeple is &s;o loud, that the Ear is hardly
able to distingui&s;h the differing Tones, but if the Ear be placed at a convenient
Di&s;tance it does plainly perceive the Harmony, and ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h each &s;e|veral
Note and Tone.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Other Objects there are, which, are &s;o minutely di&s;pers'd through<MILESTONE N="4">
other Bodies, that unle&s;s there may be many of them collected together, or
that that Matter through which they are di&s;per'd be &s;eparated from them they
are not capable of affecting the Sen&s;e. Thus Salts may lie invi&s;ible in Water,
till by Evaporation the Water be &s;eparated, and Coral di&s;&s;olv'd into Vinegar
becomes invi&s;ible, till collected by Praecipitation into a vi&s;ible Powder, thus
Vapours di&s;pers'd through the Air become &s;mall, and to the naked Eye invi|&s;ible,
till they are united clo&s;er together in a Cloud or Mi&s;t, the invi&s;ible Stars
which are di&s;per&s;ed through the Aether, become not vi&s;ible without being many
of them united into a Galaxie, or cloudy Star, thus the Tinctures al&s;o of &s;|everal
Liquors are hardly vi&s;ible till much of the more Watery and Tran&s;parent
Parts are evaporated.</P>
<P>Fifthly, There are other Objects of the Sen&s;e, which though in them&s;elves<MILESTONE N="5">
very active and powerful, yet by being mixt and united with Objects more
powerful, their Action on the Sen&s;e becomes imperceptible, becau&s;e overpow|er'd
by the &s;tronger Influence of the a&s;&s;ociated Objects: Thus the Light of the
fixed Stars in the Day-time becomes invi&s;ible by rea&s;on of the greater Light of
the Sun which fills the Air. Now the way of making the&s;e Objects &s;en&s;ible, is
by removing the Influence of the more powerful Object, either by de&s;troying,
weakning, abating, or if it be capable of it, by &s;trengthning the Powers of the
weaker. Thus (if we may believe what is affirmed by many Authors) the
Stars may be made vi&s;ible in the Day by placing the Eye at the bottom of a very
deep Well, they may be al&s;o made vi&s;ible by a total Eclip&s;e of the Sun in the
Day-time, and the like. Thus the Melody of a &s;weet Voice is not heard among
a noi&s;e of Trumpets or Drums; thus the Pallate cannot di&s;tingui&s;h the Sweet|ne&s;s
and Variety of &s;uch Ta&s;tes as are mingled with others more &s;trong and
powerful; therefore even the be&s;t Drinks reli&s;h ill after eating &s;weet things,
thus 'tis commonly &s;aid, that the &s;melling of Hounds is &s;poil'd by &s;uffer|ing
<PB N="42" REF="76">
them to &s;mell of &s;trong &s;cented Bodies, thus the Light of a Gloworm, or Diamond, or
the &s;parkling of a Cat's Back by rubbing is not to be &s;een but in
the dark, and the Gravity of the Air &s;eems Lightne&s;s when encompa&s;&s;ed with
Water, which is much heavier and more powerful, but if the Water and all
other incompa&s;&s;ing heavy Fluids be remov'd, the Gravitation of it becomes ve|ry
manife&s;t.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6">Sixthly, There are other &s;en&s;ible Qualities, which cannot be di&s;tingui&s;h'd for
want of Oppo&s;ites and contrary Qualities. Thus in a Full Moon the Irregu|larities
of the Surface are not di&s;cover'd, for want of dark Shadows to be in|termixt
with the brighter Reflections; thus the Ta&s;te of Bodies is better per|ceiv'd
by being ta&s;ted after other Sub&s;tances of a different Ta&s;te, the Bright|ne&s;s
of any Colour is better di&s;cern'd by being interpos'd between Colours of a|nother
kind. And 'tis a Maxim in Musick, that Harmonies become more plea|&s;ant
and grateful, that is, affect the Sen&s;ory better by having Di&s;cords inter|mingled:
Thus Cold is better felt after Heat, Roughne&s;s after Softne&s;s, Dry|ne&s;s
after Moi&s;ture, Sweetne&s;s is better ta&s;ted after Sowerne&s;s, and the like in
all the Sen&s;es. As for the Medicinal a&s;&s;i&s;ting of the Sen&s;e&s;, I leave that to the
Phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>There remains a third way of inquiring into the Nature of Bodies and Opera|tions,
by which we may be able to write a more accurate Hi&s;tory of them, for
all the&s;e Ways I have already mention'd, though in them&s;elves very requi&s;ite,
and as it were the Letters or Elements to what follows; yet if the Natural Hi|&s;torian
proceeds no further in his Examination, his Information will be very im|perfect,
and he that &s;hall afterwards come to make u&s;e of it will find him&s;elf
nece&s;&s;itated almo&s;t to begin the whole Inquiry anew, to make over again all
tho&s;e Experiments and Ob&s;ervations that he finds Regi&s;tred, and to intermingle
divers others to the end that he may find out that which ought to have been
ready prepared to his hands; and in Truth, without pro&s;ecuting this third way
'tis not po&s;&s;ible to make Experiments with any Judgment, that is, to know
which Experiment is more or le&s;s &s;ignificant, or of greater or le&s;s Concernment
as to the Di&s;covery of the Proprieties &s;ought, for mo&s;t Experiments are like
&s;ingle Letters which &s;eldom &s;ignify but when they are joyn'd and compounded
in Syllables or Words; nor can the Hi&s;tory be freed from infinite Repetitions
and Interpo&s;itions of Experiments and Ob&s;ervations, which are either very in&s;ig|nificant
or at be&s;t indicate nothing el&s;e but what is much better manife&s;ted in
&s;ome of the other Entries and Remarks, and &s;o &s;erve only to fill Room need|le&s;ly
and perplex and weary the U&s;er or Student of it: For 'tis not fit that every
Experiment that is made &s;hould be regi&s;tred, but of a Number of good Ob&s;erva|tions
and Experiments, &s;uch ought to be cho&s;en and pick'd which are as it were
the Epitomy of the re&s;t, and compri&s;e in &s;hort and plainly all that is more
largely and widely diffus'd and ob&s;cur'd in others.</P>
<P>That therefore which will regulate and rectify both the former ways of pro-ceeding
is this Third,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art. 3d. or the Third Way of di&s;covering Na|ture by Indu|ction.</NOTE> which is an Inquiry into the Nature of things by the
Effects produced at a greater Di&s;tance, and more remote from immediately af|fecting
the Sen&s;e, and this is by putting of &s;everal Ob&s;ervations and Informations
together, and collecting from them, and by rea&s;oning and deducing from them,
&s;o as to proceed, to the culling and chu&s;ing of the Experiments and Ob&s;erva|tions
already made, and to the inventing of &s;uch farther Experiments and Ways
of &s;earching, as &s;hall be mo&s;t &s;ignificant to the Inquiry; for this will not only
make the Hi&s;tory much &s;horter, and more compendious, but much plainer,
&s;ignificant, and full.</P>
<P>The third way therefore of di&s;covering Nature, is by the Ob&s;ervation of a
great Number of Effects and Circum&s;tances; and the&s;e, tho' very many, may
be very well reduced under these two Heads.</P>

<P>There are many other ways of makingu&s;e of and deducing from Experiments

other Opportunity; the&s;e &s;eeming to me &s;ufficient to inable a diligent Inquirer
to &s;et his hands to promote &s;ignificantly this great Work of compiling &s;uch a
Philo&s;ophical Hi&s;tory, as &s;hall be both &s;ufficient and adapted for the perfecting
the Knowledge of the Works of Nature. And the&s;e being once well under|&s;tood
<PB N="45" REF="79">
and practi&s;ed, all the other will ea&s;ily follow: That therefore the&s;e may
be the more plain and ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, I &s;hall endeavour farther to ex|plicate
each of them, and to exemplify them with &s;ome ea&s;y and obvious In|&s;tances.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t way therefore of di&s;covering the Power and working of Nature
more mediately, is by the con&s;tant and more nece&s;&s;ary Effect, which are pro|duc'd
by the working Power, before it produces its final and ultimate Effects,
and the&s;e &s;erve as a Torch, Drum, or Light, by which we may be guided in our
pur&s;uit of Nature, and be inabled to di&s;tingui&s;h by what Steps, and which way
Nature proceeds.</P>
<P>1. For in&s;tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;tances in the Effects them&s;elves.</NOTE> Suppo&s;e it be inquir'd to know whether the Sun be a fired
or burning Body, Here the Body to be examin'd is &s;o far off, that we cannot
make any Tryals or Examinations of it, and 'tis of that Bigne&s;s that it cannot
be expected to be con&s;um'd in many Ages, and &s;o the ultimate Effect is not
to be look'd after; the Helps therefore of knowing may be &s;ome &s;uch as the&s;e,
what are the intermediate Effects of all Fire? Heating, &s;hining, emitting &s;ome
kinds of Fumes and Vapours, wa&s;ting the Body it burns, and u&s;ually at la&s;t
con&s;uming it: The&s;e therefore are the things to be look'd after, and diligently
examin'd; as fir&s;t whether the warming of the Earth by the Sun Beams be not
in the &s;ame manner perform'd as a Body; &s;uppo&s;e an Apple is warm'd by the
Fire, whether the Cau&s;e of Subterraneous Fires and Earthquakes may not pro|ceed
from the Heat of the Sun, as Bli&s;ters and Eruptions on the &s;ide of an Ap|ple
that is roa&s;ted by the Fire. Next, Whether the Colour of its Light be not
like that of Flame, e&s;pecially that of Nitre and Sulphur. Thirdly, Whether
it yield any Smoke or Fumes, and e&s;pecially whether &s;uch <HI>maculae</HI> and <HI>faculae</HI> as
have been di&s;cover'd in it, can be ob&s;erv'd when at the Brink to be elevated
above the Surface of the Sun: The&s;e mu&s;t be made with great Diligence and
very accurate Gla&s;&s;es, as mu&s;t al&s;o this la&s;t, which could it be certainly known
would afford us the greate&s;t Probability, and that is the di&s;covering of the Bo|dy
of the Sun to dimini&s;h and grow le&s;s, which perhaps to After Ages may not
be impo&s;&s;ible, if with very accurate Tele&s;copes this Age do exactly determine
the Diameter of the Sun. Thus the Scorbute, and many other Di&s;ea&s;es, are a long
while di&s;coverable by certain Symptoms almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible and &s;carce regarded,
before it comes to rage with its more direful Effects: By which means a diligent
Ob&s;erver may detect the very Inclinations of Nature, and then &s;urely much more
ea&s;ily turn them. Thus the Ob&s;ervations of the Change of the <HI>Nuclei</HI> of Co|mets
is an Argument of the wa&s;ting and Con&s;umption; thus al&s;o, by the daily
Progre&s;&s;es of the Motion of the Comet, we may ea&s;ily judge of the Di&s;tance
and Velocity and way of it.</P>
<P>2. Secondly, Nature may &s;ometimes be di&s;cover'd by comparing accidental
intermediate Effects; the&s;e as they are for the mo&s;t part not thought of, and
are a Product of Providence, &s;o do they generally afford very &s;ingular and ex|cellent
Information, and u&s;ually much more than the more con&s;tant and ne|ce&s;&s;ary
and expected Circum&s;tances. Thus by an abortive Birth, much more
may be learnt of the manner of Formation in the Womb, than by only examin|ing
a perfect Infant: Thus the pa&s;&s;ing of the Comet very near &s;ome Star, &s;o
that the brighte&s;t part of the Tail &s;eems to cover &s;ome Stars, and yet very little
eclip&s;e their Light, is a help to judge that the Sub&s;tance or Con&s;i&s;tence of it is very
much rarify'd, and &s;omewhat of the Nature of Smoke; Thus al&s;o by the Cur|vity
of the Tail of the Comet, and by the Deflection of it many times a good
way out of the &s;traight Line, which pa&s;&s;es through the Body of the Comet,
we may find that it cannot be cau&s;ed by Refraction, as many &s;uppo&s;e, but is
rather a real Body.</P>
<P>3. Thirdly, Nature may be di&s;covered by the con&s;tant ultimate End, or la&s;t
Effect of a Principle. Thus &s;omewhat of the Nature of a Comet may be di&s;|cover'd
by the end of it, and this we find always to be by degrees growing
&s;maller and &s;maller, and fainter and fainter, till it di&s;appears; and as it daily
decrea&s;es in Bulk, &s;o does it al&s;o in Motion, whence 'tis not improbable that
<PB N="46" REF="80">
the Cau&s;e of both is from the Increa&s;e of Di&s;tance, and the Obliquity of the
Line of its Motion to the Eye. Whereas, if it &s;hould accidentally happen,
that the Comet &s;hould dwindle away and vani&s;h, or be &s;uddenly extinct when
in its greate&s;t Velocity and Brightne&s;s, 'twould be an Argument that its Con&s;ti|tution
were of another Nature than what we &s;hall hereafter indeavour to &s;hew
it probably to be, which may &s;erve as an In&s;tance to explain what we mean
by our</P>
<P>Fourth Method of tracing Nature by the accidental ultimate Effects. An In|&s;tance
of this 4th way may be this; &s;uppo&s;e the thing &s;ought for be the Cau&s;e
of Earthquakes, Here if we inquire after the End or Events of them, we &s;hall
find that they have &s;ometimes ended in &s;trange and mon&s;trous Eruptions of
Fires, and Smokes, and Waters, and the like, ca&s;ting forth great Quantities
of burnt and melted Sulphur, Sands, Stones, Earths and Minerals, together
with new Rivers and Streams of boyling Waters, &s;ometimes rai&s;ing, otherwhile
&s;inking Mountains, &s;ometimes rai&s;ing, &s;ometimes &s;inking I&s;lands, &s;ometimes
digging, &s;ometimes filling Caves. Hence 'tis not improbable, but that Subter|raneous
Fires are the chief Cau&s;e of tho&s;e direful Effects, and that tho&s;e Fires
may be fed by Supplies of Nitrous and Sulphureous Sub&s;tances, with which
tho&s;e Places u&s;ually mo&s;t abound, that are or have been &s;ubject to the&s;e Acci|dents;
for 'tis not el&s;e imaginable without the Supply of Niter, how tho&s;e
Fires &s;hould continue to burn, &s;ince I have not yet found any Sub&s;tance what|&s;oever
that would burn without a Supply either of fre&s;h Air or Niter (the Rea|&s;on
of which I hope I have given in my Micrography) and 'tis very hard to
imagine how &s;uch va&s;t Fires &s;hould be &s;upply'd with a &s;ufficient Quantity of
fre&s;h Air, unle&s;s there be many Ventiducts under Ground, whereas we have no
Knowledge of any: Or unle&s;s by the Influx of Springs and Rivers, the Vapours
of the Water may &s;erve to &s;upply the Defect of Air, which whether &s;o or not
&s;ome further Inquiries and Experiments ought to be made; and though they
&s;hould not be found to be &s;ufficient for this Effect, yet they &s;eem very much to
contribute to the Violence of the Commotion and Eruption, which the break|ing
of Aeolipiles, and &s;mall Dubbles of Gla&s;s &s;eal'd up Hermetically half fill'd
with Water, &s;eem further al&s;o to illu&s;trate.</P>
<P>5. A Fifth way of di&s;covering Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2dly, In&s;tances in the manner and means of Natures Ope|rations, fir&s;t the more &s;ecret.</NOTE> is by taking more e&s;pecial Notice of
&s;uch Operations and Effects of Nature as &s;eem to be more &s;ecret and re&s;erv'd,
working on Bodies remov'd at &s;ome di&s;tance, &s;uch &s;trange Effects as our Sen&s;es
are wholly unable to &s;hew us any probable Cau&s;e thereof; for by di&s;covering
the true Rea&s;on of &s;uch Effects, we give our &s;elves a new or Sixth Sen&s;e,
which will open us a large new Pro&s;pect into Nature that we dreamt not of
before. An In&s;tance of this may be the Verticity or Direction of the Load-&s;tone
towards North and South; the Gravity and Attraction of the Earth towards
its Center, the Influence of the Moon on the Waters of the Sea, or on Vegetable
or Animal Bodies, the Attraction of Jet, Amber, Red wax, and the like:
we &s;hould very much labour to find out all the A&s;&s;i&s;tances we are able for the
perfecting of &s;uch Di&s;coveries, by collecting all &s;uch Experiments together, and
by comparing them one with another, that &s;o the Mind may by &s;ome of tho&s;e
ways hereafter to be mentioned, di&s;cover fir&s;t the Similitudes and Diver&s;ities
of &s;uch Operations, and may the better be enabled to know what further Ob|&s;ervations
and Experiments are nece&s;&s;ary for the Di&s;covery of their Nature.
Such Operations and Experiments therefore are to be &s;ought after for from their
Di&s;covery, the Cau&s;es of much greater Effects may appear. The Verticity of the
Load&s;tone may perhaps explain to us, why the Axis of the Earth keeps a Pa|ralleli&s;m
whil&s;t it moves about the Sun; and the Explication of Gravity may
&s;hew us the true Cau&s;e of the Circular Motion of the Moon about the Earth,
the Satellites about <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Saturn,</HI> and the Primary Planets about the
Sun, and may al&s;o &s;hew us the rea&s;on of the Currents, Ebbings and Flowings
of the Tide, and the like, which I may hereafter more fully explain.</P>
<P>6. A Sixth way of di&s;covering Nature, is by taking particular notice of &s;uch
&s;ecret Proprieties of Bodies as cau&s;e them to unite or net unite with other Bodies,

or as cau&s;e them to operate, or not to operate on contiguous Bodies, the&s;e are
Proprieties of Bodies of which the Sen&s;e can give us no other Information, but
of the Effects; and therefore the Di&s;covery of the Cau&s;es of the&s;e will give us
another, or a 7th Sen&s;e, whereby to watch and follow Nature. Of this kind
is the Animation (as I may call it) of Iron by the touch of the Load&s;tone, the
Di&s;&s;olution of hard Bodies by appropriate Men&s;truums, the Congruity or Incon|gruity
of Fluids with Fluids, or of Fluids with con&s;i&s;tent Bodies [that is, a
Propriety whereby Fluid Bodies will readily unite and intimately mingle them|&s;elves,
or adhere to &s;ome kind of Bodies, and will by no means unite and min|gle
with or adhere to other] the rai&s;ing Fermentation by Addition of Leaven
or Yea&s;t, the firing a Heap of Powder by a &s;park of Fire, the de&s;troying many
Thou&s;ands by the Infection of one Man, the Impregnation of a whole Clu&s;ter
of Eggs by one treading of the Cock; Experiments therefore and Ob&s;ervations
of this kind &s;hould be carefully &s;ought after, and all the Circum&s;tances and
Accidents diligently mark'd, mea&s;ur'd and defin'd, for that the&s;e Proprieties
whatever they be, &s;eem to be &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable In&s;truments which
Nature makes u&s;e of in all, or at lea&s;t in &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of its
Productions. I have, I hope, made it probable at lea&s;t, that Fire is nothing
but the Di&s;&s;olution or Corro&s;ion of Sulphureous heated Bodies, by the Air as a
Men&s;truum, and had I here a proper place, I hope I could &s;hew that Fermen|tation
is &s;omewhat Analogus, or of the &s;ame kind with Di&s;&s;olutions or Corro&s;ion:
If therefore we can by deducting from Ob&s;ervations and Tryals, find the true Na|ture
of this Propriety, what a Multitude of things will there be explicable thereby,
for though at fir&s;t-&s;ight all the&s;e kinds of Experiments &s;eem little in&s;tructive,
becau&s;e their Operations for the mo&s;t part are &s;uch as fall not under our Sen&s;es,
yet when their Nature is detected, that we know how to unlock tho&s;e My&s;te|ries,
then we &s;hall find their great U&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P>7. Further, Another way of di&s;covering Nature, is by taking more e&s;pecial
notice of &s;uch of her Works, wherein &s;he &s;eems to act yet more &s;ecretly and
farther remov'd from the Detection of our Sen&s;es, &s;uch as in the Formation and
Configuration of Bodies: And here we are to ob&s;erve all &s;uch things as vary
and change tho&s;e u&s;ual Methods, for if herein her Workings al&s;o can be de|tected
to be Mechanical, it will not then &s;eem impo&s;&s;ible but that &s;ome of the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable Effects of Nature may be detected by Mens Indu&s;try, and to
this end all kind of Impre&s;&s;ions on the Phantcy are to be ob&s;erv'd what kind of
Alteration they make in the Body, as in the Formation of the Faetus, in cau&s;ing
Mi&s;carriages and Abortions, in curing or producing Di&s;ea&s;es; for the&s;e kind of
Actions, we term more &s;piritual, becau&s;e our Sen&s;es help us not at all
in di&s;covering of them, and they &s;tand up as an Opprobrium to Philo&s;ophical
Inquiry, as being generally believ'd impo&s;&s;ible to be detected, and much le&s;s reduc'd
to &s;uch a Degree of Science as might tend to practi&s;e, yet if we more &s;eriou&s;ly
con&s;ider the Progre&s;s of Nature from the more &s;imple and plain Operations to
the more complicated and ab&s;tru&s;e, we may from them deduce a great Argument
of Incouragement. For we &s;hall find it to make but very &s;mall Steps, and to
add but a little more in one thing than in another, to make it a degree higher
in Perfection; there is but a &s;mall difference between Earth and &s;trong Concre|tions,
between &s;uch Concretions and Salt, between the cry&s;tallizing and &s;hooting
of Salt, and the Vegetation of Mould, and le&s;s between the Vegetation of
Mould and Mu&s;hrooms, and but a very little between the Vegetation of Mu&s;h|rooms
and Mo&s;s, and as little between Mo&s;s and Gra&s;s, and between Gra&s;s and
the mo&s;t bulky Vegetable, and no great matter between the Vegetation of
Plants and Zoophyts, and there is no great Difference between Maritime Zoo|phyts
and Oy&s;ters, Blubbers and the like; between tho&s;e and Periwinkles, and
other kinds of Shell-fi&s;h, between Shell-fi&s;h and cru&s;taceous Creatures, between
tho&s;e and Fi&s;hes, between Fi&s;hes and amphibious Creatures, &s;uch as Mor&s;es and
Sea-Calves, and the like, between tho&s;e and Aerial Animals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All &s;uch
Operations and Experiments therefore as tend to the Illu&s;tration of one of the&s;e,
are more diligently to be remark'd.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="82">
1. To proceed to the more obvious workings of Nature;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The more obvi|ous workings of Nature ex|plained.</NOTE> <HI>the fir&s;t way of
di&s;covering them, is by ob&s;erving the Method or Progre&s;s of Nature in genera|ting,
increa&s;ing, weakning or de&s;troying the &s;ame Propriety in divers States of
the &s;ame Bodies,</HI> for hereby may be di&s;cover'd what things and Circum&s;tances
are adjuvant, and what de&s;tructive of this Propriety: As &s;uppo&s;e Greenne&s;s be
the Propriety &s;ought for, we may ob&s;erve that that Propriety is mo&s;t, and in
its greate&s;t Perfection when the Plant is &s;o, and that before the Plant is come
to Maturity and is too moi&s;t, wateri&s;h, and tender, it inclines or is ting'd too
much with Blew, and afterward, as it decrea&s;es in Moi&s;ture and grows more
dry, the Yellowne&s;s increa&s;es; and as it more and more dries and grows old,
&s;o the Yellow is more and more heightned, till at la&s;t it ends almo&s;t in a Red.
So that Blew &s;eems more appropriate to Liquidity and Moi&s;ture, and Yellow
to Dryne&s;s and Sulphurou&s;ne&s;s; unle&s;s by comparing it with other Effects of
the &s;ame kind in other Bodies, as in the Generation of Colours on melted Me|tals,
where Yellow beginning fir&s;t, then Red, and after Purple, according as
the vitrify'd Skin grows thicker and thicker, we may &s;uppo&s;e that the Blewne&s;s
proceeds from the Thickne&s;s of tho&s;e Parts which afford the Colour by their
plentiful Supply of Moi&s;ture, and that as that Moi&s;ture decrea&s;es and dries
away, and tho&s;e Colour-making Bodies grow thinner and clo&s;er together, &s;o
the Colour grows by degrees Yellower and Yellower, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Again, Suppo&s;e Liquidity be the thing to be ob&s;erv'd, we &s;hall find that Wa|ter
for In&s;tance, when cold beyond &s;uch a degree grows very con&s;i&s;tent, &s;olid,
and hard, when it only &s;uffers a gentle degree of Heat or Warmth, it becomes
liquid and moi&s;t; but if Heated beyond that degree, it becomes Aerial, Fluid
and Rarify'd. Suppo&s;e Light be the Propriety to be trac'd, we may find that
Fi&s;h when fre&s;h or newly dead &s;hine not or afford no Light, when they begin
a little to taint and ferment as 'twere, they begin to &s;hine and glare, but as
they grow more putrid and rot, &s;o again the Light decrea&s;es and at la&s;t goes
quite out. So that it &s;eems for the producing Light in &s;uch a Body there is
requi&s;ite a determinate Degree of Fermentation or Corruption: Suppo&s;e the
ebbing and flowing of the Sea be inquir'd after, we find that the new Moon
makes the ebbings and flowings very great; as the Moon goes further and fur|ther
towards the fir&s;t Quarters, &s;o tho&s;e Motions do more and more decay, and
are lowe&s;t or weake&s;t at the Quarters again, as the Moon goes further from
that and nearer to its Oppo&s;ition to the Sun, &s;o the Tides again increa&s;e, and after
Decrea&s;e to the la&s;t Quarter, and after it again increa&s;e to the New
Moon: For this it remains yet farther to be ob&s;erv'd whether <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI>
the Tides are greater at the Full or the New Moon, or whether le&s;s at the fir&s;t
or la&s;t Quarter; for from the determining of the&s;e, there would be many helps
afforded for the di&s;covering of the true cau&s;e and rea&s;on of them. Suppo&s;e
Specifick Gravity be inquir'd after, we are to inquire what Body there is which
in &s;everal States of it hath &s;everal Degrees of it: And for this we may find Air,
which according as it is more or le&s;s rarify'd, &s;o has it more or le&s;s Gravita|tion,
whence we may deduce the Rarefaction and Conden&s;ation of Bodies does
dimini&s;h or augment their Gravity, and 'tis not improbable as we &s;hall add by
and by, but that this Propriety is general, that the comparative Gravity and
Levity of Bodies depends upon their comparative Conden&s;ation and Rare|faction.</P>
<P>2. <HI>The Second way of di&s;covering Nature may be, by ob&s;erving how Nature
proceeds in di&s;tributing the &s;ame Propriety in &s;everal Bodies.</HI> As &s;uppo&s;e Gra|vity
be the Propriety inquired after, we may find among Fluid Bodies, that in
Flame 'tis very little or nothing at all, in Air but very faint, in conden&s;ed Air
&s;omewhat more, in Oyl of Turpentine 'tis yet more prevalent, in ordinary re|ctify'd
Spirit of Wine a little more, in Water greater, in &s;everal Saline and
Chymical Liquors, yet more prevalent, as Oyl of Vitriol, Oyl of Tartar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
in Quick-&s;ilver mo&s;t of all, by which Progre&s;s we may learn that Gravity has
little to do with Fluidity; for that almo&s;t the heavie&s;t Body in the World is
fluid as is al&s;o the lighte&s;t, and there are few intermediate Degrees of which
there may not be found &s;ome fluid Sub&s;tance. And this will be farther mani|fe&s;ted
al&s;o, if we con&s;ider the Di&s;per&s;ion of it among con&s;i&s;tent Bodies, for
<PB N="49" REF="83">
there are con&s;i&s;tent Bodies almo&s;t of all Degrees of Gravities. But on the other
&s;ide, we &s;hall find that Gravity has a great Dependence upon Rarefaction and
Conden&s;ation, for always the mo&s;t rarify'd Bodies &s;eem to be the mo&s;t light,
and the mo&s;t condens'd the mo&s;t heavy, for as in Flame it &s;eems to be lea&s;t &s;o
in Gold does it &s;eem to be mo&s;t prevalent.</P>
<P>3<HI>ly,</HI> Another way of di&s;covering Nature, is by &s;uch Ob&s;ervations and Expe|riments
as do manife&s;t the Method of Nature in Combinations or Conjunctions,
that is, how and with what other; the Propriety &s;ought for is combin'd in &s;eve|ral
Bodies. As &s;uppo&s;e the Propriety of Heat be inquir'd for, we &s;hall find
that in the Sun and in Fire it is joyn'd with Light, but in Corro&s;ion of Metals
by Saline Liquors and in Fermentation, and in rubbing Motions, without it;
whence we may conclude Light or Darkne&s;s not nece&s;&s;ary to Heat: Next Heat
being produc'd by Oyl of Vitriol and Oyl of Turpentine mixt, and by two &s;olid
Bodies rubb'd together, &s;hews that neither is Fluidity or Con&s;i&s;tence e&s;&s;entail
in the Production of Heat; from the Heat in Flame, and boyling Water, we
may conclude Dryne&s;s and Moi&s;ture likewi&s;e not to be e&s;&s;ential; from the be|ing
able to make both Gold and Air hot, both Gravity and Levity, and Den|&s;ity
and Rarity, appear not to be e&s;&s;ential, but from a con&s;tant Conjunction of an
internal Motion of the Parts, where there is Heat; may be concluded, that tho&s;e two
have &s;ome Dependance one upon the other. From the almo&s;t con&s;tant Combi|nation
of violent Heat and Light, we may conclude them to have &s;ome great
Affinity, as al&s;o becau&s;e in mo&s;t Bodies Fluidity is joyn'd with &s;ome degree of
Heat; we may conclude tho&s;e al&s;o to have much Affinity, but how much, and
in what manner mu&s;t be determin'd by &s;ome of the other ways of Inquiry.</P>
<P>4<HI>ly,</HI> Another way of di&s;covering Nature, is by tracing her ways in disjoin|ing
or &s;eparating Proprieties, that is, very &s;eldom or never joining them toge|ther
in the &s;ame Body; as Fluidity and Sonorou&s;ne&s;s, Shining and ab&s;olute
Cold, Malleability and Tran&s;parency, Sweetne&s;s to Smell and Ta&s;te, Hardne&s;s
and Toughne&s;s, Levity and Den&s;ity. The&s;e and their Contraries are chiefly to
be ob&s;erv'd, becau&s;e &s;uch as the&s;e do &s;till lead us nearer and nearer to the Mark
we aim at, and do as 'twere circum&s;cribe Nature, and bound it &s;o as that we
know it cannot go beyond &s;uch or &s;uch Limits.</P>
<P>5<HI>ly,</HI> Another way of tracing Nature, is by ob&s;erving the Tran&s;itions it makes
from one Propriety to another; of this kind of Ob&s;ervations and Experiments
great Multitudes &s;hould be collected, that &s;o the Affinity and Dependance of
one Propriety upon another may be the better under&s;tood: For by this means
the Circum&s;tances al&s;o being well ob&s;erved, the Nature of any one of tho&s;e Pro|prieties
being known, the other cognate Propriety will ea&s;ily be di&s;cover'd. As
Sourne&s;s and Acidity does u&s;ually follow Sweetne&s;s in mo&s;t kinds of fermen|ting
Liquors, as in Wine, Beer, Ale, Metheglin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And in the making <HI>Sac|carum
Saturni,</HI> Sweetne&s;s &s;eems to return again from Sourne&s;s. Sweetne&s;s
by Combu&s;tion or Heat very often degenerates into Bitterne&s;s: And Bitterne&s;s
by long keeping &s;eems to turn into Sweetne&s;s, as in Hopt Beer long kept, Bit|terne&s;s,
Acerbity, and Sowrne&s;s in unripe Fruits, by Maturity turns into Sweet|ne&s;s;
the Blui&s;h Greene&s;s of Buds of Plants by degrees turns perfectly Green,
and as they decay degenerates into Yellow, as I noted before; Plumbs, Grapes,
Mulberries, and the like, being of a pali&s;h Green at fir&s;t, by degrees turn Red,
and at la&s;t Blue; the Colours on tempering Iron or Steel are fir&s;t of a Straw Co|lour,
then Yellow, then Red, then Purple, then Blue, and &s;o onwards. To
this Head may be referred many of tho&s;e excellent Experiments of the Tran&s;|mutation
of Colours, publi&s;ht by the Incomparable Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> Cabages by an
Inclination to Putrefaction do often produce a mo&s;t fragrant and Musk-like
Odour, but &s;uffer'd to putrify quite, their Stink is not to be indur'd; Apples
al&s;o by Putrefaction do oft produce very plea&s;ing Smells, Musk al&s;o is &s;aid to be
the Corruption of the Fle&s;h and Blood of a kind of Dear: But generally all kind
of putrify'd Sub&s;tances, e&s;pecially Animal, ingender very loath &s;ome Smells, which
&s;eem to be caus'd by a very penetrant and volatile Salt, which by the Di&s;&s;o|lution
of the Texture of tho&s;e Sub&s;tances is let loo&s;e, and being very Aerial
<PB N="50" REF="84">
readily mixes and joins it &s;elf with the Air, from whence at fir&s;t it &s;eems to
have been taken.</P>
<P>6<HI>ly,</HI> Another way of di&s;covering Nature, is by endeavouring to find by what
ways Nature produces the &s;ame Effect in divers Bodies, whether always the
&s;ame ways, or for the mo&s;t part by differing, or by &s;ome few; and among all
the&s;e Experiments and Ob&s;ervations, we are to make choice of &s;uch e&s;pecially,
wherein the Propriety &s;ought for is produced by &s;ome Cau&s;e that &s;eems lea&s;t
incumbred with perplexing Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>As for in&s;tance, Whether Nature produces Heat in the Sun, in Fire, in Mo|tion,
in Fermentation, in Baths and hot Springs, in quick Lime &s;lack'd with
Water, in the Operation of corro&s;ive Men&s;truums, in Animals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all the &s;ame
way, or whether differing ways: That is, whether the Sun be not a Sulphu|reous
and Nitrous Earth or Globule fir'd and con&s;um'd, or di&s;&s;olv'd either by
it own Nitrou&s;ne&s;s, or by the Circum-ambient Air, whether that and our com|mon
Fire be not much the &s;ame kind of Operation (but with differing Men|&s;truums
and differing Di&s;&s;olubles) with that of corro&s;ive Men&s;truums; and
whether Fermentation be not a kind of Di&s;&s;olution or Corro&s;ion, whereby the
Parts work upon one another, and whether quick Lime &s;lack'd by Water will
not prove the &s;ame kind of Operation, Namely, the working of the Alkali in
the quick Lime on the Body of the Water; whether Baths and hot Springs proceed
not from Subterraneous Fires, and tho&s;e maintain'd by a nitrous
and &s;ulphureous Fuel there plac'd; whether the Heat in Animals be not caus'd
by the continual working of the Liquors and Juices of the Body one upon ano|ther,
and more e&s;pecially by the uniting of the Volatile Salt of the Air with
the Blood in the Lungs, which is done by a kind of Corro&s;ion or Fermentation,
which to me I confe&s;s &s;eems &s;omewhat more than probable; Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e that
only tho&s;e Animals that breath much are very hot, all other kinds of them are
even cold to a Man's touch, as Fi&s;hes, Snakes, Frogs, Cameleons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Next,
That all tho&s;e Exerci&s;es which cau&s;e the Blood to circulate much, and con&s;e|quently
to make the Animal breath much, do make the Heat to increa&s;e, and
the expir'd Vapours, to be more copious. Thirdly, That &s;uch as &s;tir little, and
con&s;equently who&s;e Blood does circulate but &s;lowly, breath but little and
&s;eldom, and are generally mo&s;t cold in Con&s;titution and grow Flegmatick, and
at la&s;t &s;hort breath'd, and are very apt to fall into Fevers or Exce&s;&s;es of Heat
and Inflamations as it were; becau&s;e tho&s;e Parts which &s;hould have been wrought
on by the Air, and thereby have been brought to another kind of Con&s;titution
and concocted, are in great Quantity laid up in the Blood&punc; So that at la&s;t the
Blood becomes over charg'd by them, and the Lungs become &s;tuff'd and &s;topt,
Whence wanting the Pre&s;ervative Salt of the Air, they upon all occa&s;ions are
apt to cau&s;e unnatural Fermentations and Putrefactions which inflame and de|&s;troy
the natural Texture and Con&s;titution of the Blood, Humours and Parts,
and &s;o vitiate oftentimes and de&s;troy the very Principles of Life. Further, the
Ebullition of Steams into the Lungs, which are carried out with the Breath by
Expiration, may probably be cau&s;ed by the Ebullition of the Blood upon the
mixing of the Salt of the Air, &s;omewhat after the Nature, as Oyl of Tartar
will bubble by the Affu&s;ion of Volatile and Acid Salts, now whether &s;o or not,
de&s;erves to be further inquir'd into. But this by the by; Another In&s;tance, to illu|&s;trate
this Head, may be the Method Nature u&s;es in generating Colours: That is,
whether the Colours in the Rain&punc; bow, in Triangular Cry&s;tal and Gems, in Bub|bles
and plated Bodies, in Flowers, Woods, Leaves, Stones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In Liquors
and Flame be all of the &s;ame kind, and from one and the &s;ame Principle di&s;|gui&s;ed
under &s;everal Masks or Ve&s;ts; or whether Nature has not almo&s;t in eve|ry
of them taken a differing way. This will be found by reducing each of them
to the mo&s;t &s;imple Principles, and by endeavouring to find out whether
there be not &s;ome one Principle wherein they all agree; for if it can be found
that all of them do depend upon Tran&s;parency and Refraction, and that by de|&s;troying
that Principle in any of them all the Colours will immediately va|ni&s;h,
'tis a very great Argument that that is the chief Cau&s;e of all tho&s;e Ap|pearances,
and all the re&s;t are but accidental and circum&s;tantial, &s;omewhat of
this kind I have endeavour'd to explain in my Micrography. A Third thing
<PB N="51" REF="85">
may be the Method of Nature, in producing Light, in &s;ome we find it to be
effected by a violent Di&s;&s;olution of the Body, as in Fire, and perhaps in the
Sun, in others we find it to be an Effect of a very gentle and &s;carce &s;en&s;ible
Di&s;&s;olution, as in Fi&s;h and rotten Wood, and perhaps the Gloworm; in others
the Effect of a gentle Heat or Motion, as in a Diamond and <HI>Bononian</HI> Stone, from
another Cau&s;e in the Scintillation of the Hair of a Cats Back when &s;trok'd
much and quick in the dark, from another Cau&s;e in the &s;hining of the Juice of
a 100 legg'd Worm when kill'd in the dark. From another, the &s;hining of
<HI>Ignes Fatui,</HI> Dews, Sea-water, and the like. Now from the comparing of
the&s;e &s;everal ways Nature makes u&s;e of for the producing of the&s;e Effects,
it will not be difficult to find that there is one Principal Cau&s;e of all, which is
in almo&s;t each of them conceal'd under a differing covering. Now by ca&s;ting
away all tho&s;e Circum&s;tances, which by comparing them one with another,
will be found needle&s;s and accidental as to the producing of Colour, we may
quickly come to that which is the only true and adequate Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>7<HI>ly,</HI> Another Method of Di&s;covery may be by taking notice of all &s;uch Pro|ce&s;&s;es
of Nature, wherein by the &s;ame effective Principle it cau&s;es quite differ|ring
Products: For by di&s;tingui&s;hing and defining carefully the con&s;iderable Cir|cum&s;tances
of &s;uch Operations, the Nature of both of them will be the more
ea&s;ily found. As why Heat for in&s;tance, does in Bricks fir&s;t by a gentle de|gree
cau&s;e a Conden&s;ation, and &s;hrinking, and hardning, and afterwards by a
more violent cau&s;es a Rarefaction, Liquefaction and &s;oftning, if we ob&s;erve
well the Circum&s;tances we may find that the fir&s;t is caus'd only by the flying
away of the more watery and liquid Part that kept the other a little further
disjoin'd, whereby tho&s;e more &s;olid Parts &s;lide and fall nearer together, where|as
even then tho&s;e more &s;olid Parts were not condens'd but rarify'd, as all other
&s;olid Bodies are by a &s;en&s;ible degree of Heat; and as for the other Effects they
are but a further Augmentation of the &s;ame Product. Another In&s;tance may be
the Conden&s;ation and Rarefaction of Water by Cold; the Rea&s;ons of one of
which Operations &s;eem a little more ab&s;tru&s;e, and de&s;erve to be farther in|quir'd
into; Namely, why Water &s;hould continue to conden&s;e more and more,
till it comes to &s;uch a degree of Cold, and afterwards according as the Cold
increa&s;es, &s;o does the Expan&s;ion of the Water into Ice. The Di&s;covery of the true
Rea&s;on of which Experiment will very probably afford us a much larger Pro|&s;pect
into the ways of Nature than we have yet been Ma&s;ters of, towards the
finding of which it will be requi&s;ite to take notice of and examine well all the
Proprieties of Ice and Snow, &s;uch as are the &s;eeming Blebs or Bubbles generated,
the Figures of falling Snow and the Figures of frozen Snow, both which are
very &s;trange and extreamly pretty; the Figures and manner of the freezing of
Ice, the Refraction of Ice, and the Lightne&s;s of it, and the like.</P>
<P>8<HI>ly,</HI> Another way of Di&s;covery, is by indeavouring to find out &s;uch Experi|ments
as may di&s;tingui&s;h between two or more Principles, and &s;hew what the
Influence or Power of each of them is towards the producing of that Effect
whereunto they &s;eem both or all to concur: Of this kind there are Multitudes
in Natural Operations, which Operations are very &s;eldom &s;o &s;ingle as to be
perform'd and perfected by one active Principle only, but to the producing of
almo&s;t all its Effects, Nature for the mo&s;t part makes u&s;e of two, three, or
more co-operating Principles; the di&s;tingui&s;hing the adequate Power of each of
which is one of the mo&s;t difficult things in all Philo&s;ophical Inquiries, &s;uch
Methods and Rules therefore as a&s;&s;i&s;t us in this Performance, ought e&s;pecially
to be look'd after. As for In&s;tance, in the Fulmination of Gunpowder, what
the &s;everal Offices of the three Bodies of which it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to be com|pounded
are, what Part the Nitre, what the Sulphur, and what the Cole acts&punc;
the like in the fulminating Powder, de&s;crib'd by <HI>Glauber,</HI> made of Salt of Tar|tar,
Sulphur and Nitre, who&s;e Operation &s;eems to be quite differing from that
of Gunpowder, and nearer to approach to the Nature of <HI>Aurum Fulminans,</HI>
which is a third thing of this kind to be ob&s;erv'd, made of the Powder of
Gold precipitated out of <HI>Aqua Regis,</HI> by Spirit of Urine, or Salt of Tar|tar;
and &s;eeming to want the Sulphur, which &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to the other two,
<PB N="52" REF="86">
unle&s;s the Gold may be &s;aid to &s;upply it; the like Inquiry may be made concer|ning
the Cau&s;e of Di&s;&s;olution: As for In&s;tance, of Gold in <HI>Aqua Regis,</HI>
whether the Gold it &s;elf do not contribute as an active Principle; to the di&s;per|&s;ing
of it &s;elf in the <HI>Aqua Regis,</HI> as well as the <HI>Aqua Regis</HI> doth to the Penetration
or corroding the Gold; and in the <HI>Aqua Regis,</HI> what the Sal Armoniack,
and what the Nitrous Spirit contributes towards that Action. And herein the
ways for Di&s;covery mu&s;t be by varying either the &s;everal Ingredients them&s;elves
if it can be, and by ob&s;erving in what the new &s;ub&s;tituted ones differ from the
other either in Quantity, Quality, Time, manner of operating, and the like,
or el&s;e by indeavouring to vary and alter the Quantities of the Ingredients them|&s;elves;
and by ob&s;erving diligently all the Circum&s;tances of the &s;ucceeding
Effects. Or el&s;e Thirdly, &s;omething may be learnt by mixing one or two other
Ingredients, and ob&s;erving and comparing their Effects to con&s;ider in all of
them in what common Nature they all agree, and in what they mo&s;t of them
differ, what Bodies &s;eem to promote, and what to hinder tho&s;e Operations.</P>
<P>9. Another way of tracing Nature is by ob&s;erving the Re&s;emblance or Di&s;|crepancy
of Natures working in the producing the like parts in differing Kinds,
Species, or Individuals. This Method is very luciferous, and produces very co|pious
Matter of Information, for by ob&s;erving how Nature varies its Method
according to &s;everal De&s;igns we may ea&s;ily by comparing, and rejecting, quickly
arrive to &s;ome po&s;itive Information, what the U&s;e and Bu&s;ine&s;s of each part is;
as for in&s;tance, by ob&s;erving the Keys of Sicamores, Maples, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and finding in
them a tender, but perfect Plant wrap'd up and clos'd in a Box or Ca&s;e, &s;o as
to pre&s;erve it from taking Injury, which by being buried in the Ground in warm
Weather does by degrees &s;well and break the Shell, and grow up in a Plant:
And comparing this with the like Proce&s;s of mo&s;t other Seeds, though the Plant
or Web of them be not &s;o vi&s;ible, we may conclude that they al&s;o have the
&s;ame Principle in them though &s;omewhat farther remov'd or hid from our Sen&s;e;
And by comparing the&s;e with the Eggs of Serpents, Crocodiles, Ae&s;tridges,
Tortoi&s;es, and Multitudes of other Oviparous In&s;ects, who lay their Eggs in
convenient Receptacles, that the Heat of the Sun or Air may hatch, we &s;hall
find it very probable that Nature takes the &s;ame cour&s;e both in the one and the
other; but with &s;ome difference, that in &s;ome &s;he &s;eems to operate more open|ly,
in others more &s;ecretly and re&s;erved. And by comparing likewi&s;e the Me|thod
of Nature in the Formation of the Faetus in the Womb, we may find rea|&s;on
to conclude, that all kinds of Vegetable and Animal Bodies are propagated
by much the &s;ame Ways and Methods, though &s;omewhat varied in Circum|&s;tances,
the Ob&s;ervation and diligent Examination of which by Experiments
will hugely promote this Inquiry. Thus al&s;o by comparing the Contrivances
for Motion in the Leaves and Branches of the &s;en&s;ible Plant, with the Mu&s;cles
and In&s;truments of Motion in In&s;ects, Birds, Bea&s;ts, Fi&s;hes, &s;caled, &s;hell'd, and
cru&s;taceous, each of them &s;eeming in &s;ome particular or other to differ, and by
joyning to the&s;e &s;everal other &s;elf-moving Bodies, as the Beard of a wild Oat,
the wreathed Seeds of Muskgra&s;s, the &s;hrinking of Gut-&s;trings, the Expan&s;ion
of fired Gunpowder, the Corro&s;ion of acid Liquors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we &s;hall find many
helps to judge of what is mo&s;t likely to be the true cau&s;e of the Motive Power
of the Mu&s;cles: For every Di&s;crepancy in the&s;e brings us a &s;tep nearer to the
thing &s;ought for, by le&s;ning the Bounds, or at lea&s;t by fixing the Terms with|in
which it mu&s;t be found.</P>
<P>10. Another way of Di&s;covery is by taking notice of the Tran&s;itions of Nature,
by what degrees and &s;teps it pa&s;&s;es from one thing to another in the Formation
of Species; for this will afford, very great Light, how to find out which Pro|duct
of Nature is mo&s;t &s;imple, and which mo&s;t complicated, which the mo&s;t
perfect, and which is farthe&s;t from it, and wherein the Additions or Defects lie.
And accordingly from this we &s;hall be the better inabled to find out the Signi|ficancy
and U&s;e of each part: As &s;uppo&s;e from a Man Nature &s;eems to de&s;cend
to an Ape, Monkey, or Baboon, which we may find in very many things to
imitate Man very exactly, as in its Figure, Gate, and Je&s;ture, as is te&s;tified by
&mdash;in his Natural Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> in frowning, grinning, and
<PB N="53" REF="87">
laughing, as divers Travellers a&s;&s;ure us, but &s;eem to want the U&s;e of Rea&s;on
and Speech, the things wherein they differ in Figure from Men are chiefly
the&s;e; that the comparative Bulk of their Brain is much le&s;s in Proportion to
their Bodies than that of a Man, as has been excellently well ob&s;erv'd by the
Learned Phy&s;ician Dr. <HI>Willis,</HI> that they are all over cover'd with Hair, that
their Heads and No&s;es are flatted, and their Mouth thru&s;t out, tending &s;omewhat
towards the Shape of other Bea&s;ts; that their Legs and Arms are much
&s;horter in proportion to their Bodies than tho&s;e of Men, and that their Spine,
and con&s;equently the Spinal Marrow is yet &s;pun out longer and &s;maller into a
long Tail: And which may be further taken notice of, that tho&s;e which have
naturally the longe&s;t Tails are u&s;ually <HI>caeteris paribus</HI> the furthe&s;t remote from
imitating the Actions of a Man, and do &s;eem neare&s;t approaching to the Capa|city
of other Brutes. And there is no doubt but that a diligent Ob&s;erver may
by accurately anatomizing each, and comparing them together, find divers other
con&s;iderable Variations which are of a kind of middle Con&s;titution, between
tho&s;e of a Man and tho&s;e of other the mo&s;t brute Creatures; which may much
inable an Inquirer in finding what parts of a Man &s;eem mo&s;t to contribute to
the Perfection of his Natural Parts. Another In&s;tance may be this, to ob&s;erve
the Tran&s;ition of Nature between the Figure of precious Stones, and the cry&s;tal|lizing
of Salts, between the &s;hooting of Salt, and the growing of Mould and
Mu&s;hrooms, and its Tran&s;ition from Mu&s;hrooms to Mo&s;s, and from Mo&s;s to
Gra&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The accurate Ob&s;ervations of all which Tran&s;itions, together with
all the Circum&s;tances that attend upon them, will with a Clew almo&s;t lead us
from the Explication of the mo&s;t plain, &s;ingle, and obvious Phaenomenon, to the
Under&s;tanding of the inmo&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ecluded Proce&s;s of Nature.</P>
<P>11. Another way of Di&s;covery, is <HI>by taking Notice of all &s;uch Experiments
and Accidents as &s;hew the Fru&s;trations and Failings of Nature;</HI> for all &s;uch Ex|periments
as the&s;e, the Circum&s;tances being diligently noted, afford very e&s;&s;en|tial
Di&s;tinctions, and do very much direct, circum&s;cribe, and limit the Mind
in its &s;earch: and, by &s;hewing what things are de&s;tructive to it and
over-rule and govern it, and what pervert it and turn it out of its Cour&s;e, it very much fi$s
the Mind for po&s;itive and affirmative Knowledge of the Cau&s;es of tho&s;e Effects.
For in&s;tance, Let the Nature of Fire be the thing &s;ought for: Here, we are to
look chiefly after &s;uch Experiments as &s;hew the failing of Nature in this Ope|ration,
&s;uch as the&s;e; the falling of Water on the Fire makes it immediately
go out, query whether from the Coldne&s;s or Moi&s;ture; that 'tis not from
the Coldne&s;s is evident, becau&s;e boyling Water will produce the &s;ame Effect, nor
is it from the Moi&s;ture, becau&s;e then Spirit of Wine would do the &s;ame thing
which, yet it does not; query further therefore, whether it be by keeping off
the Men&s;truum of the Air, if &s;o, then the keeping of that Body any ways from
coming to it will do the &s;ame Effect. To confirm this, we have many In&s;tances
of the Fru&s;tration of Nature; as that a Candle will pre&s;ently go out if inclos'd
in a Ve&s;&s;el, whereby the fre&s;h Air is excluded: The like it will pre&s;ently do,
if it be included in a larger Ve&s;&s;el, and the Air drawn out. Coles likewi&s;e
will do the &s;ame, if included in a clo&s;e Ve&s;&s;el, nay though by a pair of Bel|lows
included in the Box with them, they be all the time blown upon by them,
as I have &s;everal times &s;hewn before very many illu&s;trious Spectators.</P>
<P>12. Another way of Di&s;covery, is <HI>by ob&s;erving the Deviation of Nature in
framing Specifick Bodies,</HI> &s;uch kind of Operations wherein Nature &s;eems to
&s;tep a little a&s;ide out of its u&s;ual Rode, and &s;eems to take up a new Method
in forming: Now the&s;e though in them&s;elves they &s;eem at fir&s;t to amaze and
perplex the Mind, yet when by diligent Examination and Inquiry the Vail that
Covers them is remov'd, and it be di&s;cover'd to which of the more common
Operations of Nature it belongs, and wherein it differs from them, then does it
as the former, highly a&s;&s;i&s;t the Judgment in determining the true Nature of
that Principle, by manife&s;ting what great Influence the&s;e or tho&s;e accidental
Concurrents had in altering or di&s;gui&s;ing it &s;o as to make it appear &s;omewhat
extraordinary and miraculous. As for in&s;tance, the Load&s;tone &s;eems to be an
In&s;tance of the Deviation of Nature out of its u&s;ual Method, and &s;eems to con|tain
<PB N="54" REF="88">
&s;ome Principles in it altogether extraordinary and very wonderful, but
when we have taken this excellent Compo&s;ition to pieces, and found that it is
re&s;embled in &s;ome of its Proprieties by the Motion of an Uni&s;on String, in others
by the Attraction of rubbed Jet, Amber, Wax, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that both its Axis may be
varied Mechanically into another Po&s;ture, and that its Poles may be turn'd end
for end, and that its Vertue may be quite de&s;troyed as well as Mechanically
augmented; that it has a Dependence on the Earth, and is mov'd by it, as ha|ving
the fir&s;t and chief Magnetical Principle which moves all the re&s;t; that the
Sun, Moon, and all other the Planets, have the &s;ame or alike Vertue with this
of the Earth, and that the Load&s;tone has given the occa&s;ion of the Di&s;covery of
all the&s;e: When we con&s;ider this In&s;tance, I &s;ay, we may plainly &s;ee of what
great U&s;e Ob&s;ervations and Experiments of this kind are, for the finding out of
the Methods and Ways of Nature which are &s;omewhat beyond the Di&s;covery of
our Sen&s;es. Another In&s;tance may be a Diamond, which for two or three Pro|prieties
&s;eems extraordinary, the fir&s;t and chiefe&s;t is Radiation in the dark, after
it has been gently rubb'd or &s;truck, which gives us a new manner of producing
Light &s;eeming to depend on the other Property, namely, an extraordinary Hard|ne&s;s,
and affords anew Difference or Help of Rejection: for &s;ince in this Experi|ment
there is neither Combu&s;tion nor Flame as in Fire, nor Moi&s;ture and Putre|faction
as in Fi&s;h and rotten Wood, nor a Motion of Animal Spirits, which
&s;ome pretend to be the Cau&s;e in Glow-worms and Cats Eyes; nor any previous
Light, which &s;ome have imagined to inhere and remain like a Liquor in the
Object till it be evaporated or dry'd, as in the Bononian Stone, by the help of
this one extravagant In&s;tance all the&s;e Suppo&s;itions are rejected, as not at all ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to the Exi&s;tence of Light, and only this one e&s;&s;ential Propriety &s;eems to
be &s;et up in the &s;tead of them; namely, a very quick Vibrative Motion, which
a Body of that extream Hardne&s;s &s;eems only capable of from &s;o &s;mall and &s;ud|den
a Percu&s;&s;ion, as that has been ob&s;erved to &s;hine with. Another In&s;tance of
this Rule may be the Apparition of Colours in the Triangular or Sexangular
Stiriae of Cry&s;tal, for therein Nature &s;eems to generate a lovely Variety of Co|lours
after quite another way, than it &s;eems to do in other Bodies whether Ve|getable,
as Flowers, Leaves, Woods, Fruits; or Animal, as Blood, Gall, Hair,
Feathers; or Mineral, as Metals, Marcha&s;ites, Scoria, Vitriols, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in all which, &s;ome Authors will needs have a various Temperament of Sulphur and
Mercury to be the chief and principal Cau&s;e. Now by this one Experiment or
Ob&s;ervation of Cry&s;tal, the&s;e and divers other phanta&s;tical Hypothe&s;es about
Colour are overthrown, and by examining it thoroughly it may be found that
this does demon&s;trate only one thing nece&s;&s;ary, namely, a con&s;iderable Refra|ction
enough to obliquate the Puls of Light, as I have in my Micrography in|deavoured
more fully to explain. Such Experiments as the&s;e do hugely &s;treng|then
the Di&s;cur&s;ive Faculty, and (at one Blow as it were) inables it to cut off
all tho&s;e numerous Heads of Hydra, which when cut off one by one do a&punc; fre&s;h
&s;pring up again, and create new and greater Difficulties, but by watching Nature
and taking hold of this opportunity of the Deviation of it, the Victory
becomes ea&s;y and &s;peedy.</P>
<P>13. Another way of Di&s;covery, is <HI>by taking notice of all &s;uch Productions of
Nature, as are differing from the re&s;t of the &s;ame Species,</HI> and are therefore
truly e&s;teem'd mon&s;trous and wonderful by the Generality, but a Philo&s;ophical
Hi&s;torian has &s;omewhat el&s;e to do than admire them; for the&s;e are indeed the
mo&s;t in&s;tructive and the riche&s;t Commodities he can meet with. His Busine&s;s
therefore is diligently to &s;et upon examining of it both as to the Cau&s;es of it;
and as to the particular Effects, and to indeavour to find out wherein lies the
Deviation in what con&s;iderable Circum&s;tances they differ from the mo&s;t u&s;ual
Effects, and wherein the My&s;terie of Nature's proceeding after &s;uch a manner
lies, what Cau&s;e it was made it thus deviate. One therefore that is fit to
make Ob&s;ervation of this kind, mu&s;t fir&s;t be very well skill'd in the mo&s;t u&s;ual
ways of Nature of that kind, &s;o as that he may be able readily to detect all
the Aberrations of Nature: Nor is this Knowledge indeed &s;ufficient, but he ought
to be &s;omewhat knowing al&s;o in the U&s;es and De&s;igns of the parts of that Spe|cies
whereof the thing under Examination is an Aberration&punc; for 'tis none of the
<PB N="55" REF="89">
lea&s;t Helps, towards the finding out the Nature of the thing &s;ought for, to be
able to know and judge what things are material and con&s;iderable enough to be
ob&s;erved; for 'tis not the &s;etting down of every little Variation, of which there
be Multitudes in every individual of the &s;ame Species, whereby they differ one
from another, mo&s;t of tho&s;e being to be pa&s;t over as the Effects of a <HI>lu&s;us na|turae;</HI>
that is, of many little Circum&s;tances which perhaps 'tis impo&s;&s;ible ever
to be able to take notice of, or find out, there being continually &s;uch Multi|tudes
of them and tho&s;e &s;o complicated: Nor again on the other &s;ide are &s;mall,
nay almo&s;t unperceivable Variations in &s;ome ca&s;es to be pa&s;t by where the Cau|&s;es
can be certainly found, or where tho&s;e though never &s;o &s;mall Variations,
become con&s;iderable toward the producing greater Effects; for &s;ometimes tho&s;e
Variations which &s;eem greate&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;picuous are very incon&s;iderable,
and as to the promoting of Natural Knowledge &s;carce &s;ignificant. So that 'tis
not every one that can be pre&s;ently fit for this Undertaking, but it requires a
long and &s;edulous indeavour and accu&s;toming ones &s;elf to ob&s;erve the Methods
and Cour&s;es of Nature; without which endeavour'd 'tis much to he fear'd
that the Hi&s;tory &s;o written will be full &s;tufft with Impertinencies, and con|tain
very little of any thing &s;olid, material and u&s;eful. Of this kind there
are Multitudes of In&s;tances among Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals, all
kind of extravagant natural Actions, Generations, Vegetations or Accretions,
Di&s;ea&s;es, Ca&s;ualties, Conjugations, and Separations, and the like; being to
be numbred under this, and every one in their &s;everal Kinds, if accurately ex|amin'd,
affording choice and rare Informations which a&s;&s;i&s;t us beyond any other
way, how to command and regulate Nature, by either promoting or further|ing
it in its u&s;ual Method.</P>
<P>14. Another way of Di&s;covery is, <HI>by ob&s;erving the concomitant Proprieties
of Individuals in their greate&s;t or highe&s;t, and in the lowe&s;t pitch of their Per|fections
or Exi&s;tences.</HI> As the former was of the extravagant and preter-natural
Concomitants in a preter-natural State, &s;o this of a Natural: For though the
former be an excellent Method of Di&s;covery, yet that alone, and of it &s;elf is
not &s;ufficient; we ought as well to know what things and Circum&s;tances ac|company
the natural Progre&s;&s;es of Nature as well as the preter natural, that
by the comparing the&s;e two together the Differences between them may more
manife&s;tly appear. As for in&s;tance, that in an Infant the parts are &s;oft, moi&s;t
and tender, and as very unfit for Animal Motion &s;o have they very little, till
after a certain time mo&s;t of tho&s;e parts begin to grow a little more dry and
&s;tiff, but yet retaining Plenty of Natural Juice and Moi&s;ture, whereby all the
numerous Parts of the Automaton (like tho&s;e of a new and clean Clock, that
has been a little us'd to take off the Roughne&s;s and is well oyl'd) ea&s;ily and
glibly move and &s;lip by one another and con&s;onant hereunto, that Con&s;titution
of Body is ever in Motion, eats much and acts much, is quickly wound up, and
whurr 'tis quickly down again, and a new &s;upply of Aliment mu&s;t be had.
And thus it continues to be wound up and run down, till by degrees the Oyl
begins to be a little &s;pent, and to grow &s;omewhat more &s;tiff, and the Parts to
be well worn and adapted one to another when it arrives at its be&s;t going; the
Child being become a Man, his Parts by much Exerci&s;e become very prompt
and habituated, they move not &s;o much, as at fir&s;t but more &s;teady and regular,
the parts become more firm and con&s;i&s;tent, the <HI>Humidum Radicale</HI> &s;eems to be
perfectly concocted and brought up to its ju&s;t Con&s;i&s;tence, being neither too
thin and watery, or too thick and clammy: But as he grows older the Parts
grow dryer and &s;tiffer, and le&s;s fit for Motion; the Natural Moi&s;ture is grown
too thick and flug, and the parts begin to &s;hrink and &s;hrivel, and to be clogg'd
and worn, and all the Motions become $lower and more heavy, and the parts
grow quickly weary, a little Food &s;erves long, the Juice in many parts of the
Body become &s;o charg'd with excrementitious parts thereof, that it turns
into a kind of hard or &s;tony Con&s;i&s;tence: and like an old decayed and foul
piece of Clock-work, here a Pivot is worn loo&s;e in his Socket, there the Oyl
is thickned with Du&s;t and Filth, as almo&s;t to &s;top the Motion: Here a Wheel
is bent, and there a Tooth is worn out, and the like. Now as the&s;e things
which are the common Accidents of Watches, and do generally happen to all
<PB N="56" REF="90">
&s;ooner or later, according as they are better or wor&s;e u&s;ed, are very ea&s;y to be
found by a diligent Ob&s;erver, though altogether ignorant of Watches; and
by comparing the &s;everal Accidents one with another, he may at la&s;t be
able to under&s;tand a Watch thoroughly, and know wherein the Goodne&s;s or Badne&s;s
of one con&s;i&s;ts, and what is good and bad for it, &s;o may one that is wholly
ignorant of the Fabrick of any Natural Body be able to learn the Nature of
it, by ob&s;erving the &s;everal Accidents that happen to it in the &s;everal States and
Conditions of it.</P>
<P>15. Now as the Ob&s;ervation of the various Accidents of Bodies in &s;everal
States is one way of Di&s;covery, <HI>&s;o another way may be of ob&s;erving &s;uch Va|riations
as happen to Bodies from their being produc'd at differing times, or in
differing Places, of the &s;ame Medium, or in differing Mediums, or with a
differing Quantity;</HI> for each of the&s;e kinds of Ob&s;ervations do further manife&s;t
to us by what Rules Nature works, and by what things it becomes regulated
and circum&s;crib'd. Of this kind may be the ob&s;erving of the difference be|tween
the Shape and Nature of a wild <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Man (or &s;uch a one as has nothing
of Education to bia&s;s him) and one of <HI>Saldania</HI> or the <HI>Cape of good Hope.</HI> The
Difference between the Stature, Age, Strength, Shape, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Men at the be|ginning
of the World and now. The Difference between the Fins of the flying
Herring and the Wings of a Bird, between a Crab and a Spider, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the one
being an In&s;ect of the Water, and the other of the Air. The Difference between
Bea&s;ts of the &s;ame Species under the Pole, and under the Line, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>16. Another way of Di&s;covery is, <HI>by ob&s;erving what things mo&s;t conduce to
the Per&s;ection or De&s;truction of any Production:</HI> This is differing from the
next but one preceding, in this, that there we con&s;idered only &s;uch things as ac|cidentally
were found Concomitants with the &s;everal Conditions not &s;o much
con&s;idering them as Cau&s;es; but here out of many of tho&s;e former, we &s;egre|gate
and collect &s;uch as &s;eem very active and contribute either to the better
perfecting, or to the De&s;truction of Overthrow of &s;uch a Body. As &s;uppo&s;e
that Fire be the Subject enquired into, we &s;hall find Nitre or fre&s;h Air, and
&s;ome Sulphureous Body, to be that which mo&s;t powerfully makes that Opera|tions,
and that nothing does de&s;troy and hinder it &s;o much, as the &s;eparating
of the intermediate Contract of tho&s;e two Bodies, by the throwing on of Water
or any other incombu&s;tible and &s;luggi&s;h Liquor.</P>
<P>17. Another way of Di&s;covery is, to find out and enumerate <HI>all &s;uch Opera|tions
of Nature as wherein it &s;eems to work after a peculiar manner, and very
differing from her more u&s;ual Methods;</HI> for by this means many Circum&s;tances
are cut off, which being generally the Concomitants in her more u&s;ual Method,
are therefore more liable to be thought e&s;&s;ential to the producing of the Pro|priety
&s;ought. For In&s;tance, the Flying Herrings commonly ob&s;erved flying in
great Sholes in the Torrid Zone, may &s;eem as an excellent In&s;tance to manife&s;t
that to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of flying, there is no need of Feathers about the Body, nor
in the Wings, nor in the Tail, as mo&s;t imagine; and the Poets &s;eem to con|firm
it by the Story <HI>Daedalus</HI> and <HI>Icarus,</HI> &s;ince this Fi&s;h has nothing but Fins
and Scales: Nor &s;econdly, is there any need of a flat Tail, &s;uch as all kind of
Birds have and Bats; for the Tail of this Fi&s;h &s;tands edge-ways: Nor thirdly,
is there any need of Joynts in the Arm, or Stems of the Wing, as in the Pin|nions
of Birds, and in the Fingers of the Bat; nor is it &s;o nece&s;&s;ary that the
Stem of the Wing mu&s;t needs grow in the Center of Gravity, &s;ince this is
not ob&s;erv'd in this Creature, and divers other &s;uch Circum&s;tances which were
generally believ'd to be nece&s;&s;ary Circum&s;tances to the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Flying by
the Peculiarity of Nature, in Shaping this Fi&s;h after this kind, and induing it
with the Power of Flying; they are all of them di&s;covered to be only mo&s;t pro|per
for that peculiar Creature to which they were adapted, and where no &s;uch
Accompli&s;hment is be&s;towed on a Creature by Nature, 'tis as proper if we
would &s;upply that Defect artificially to make u&s;e of one way as well as the
other, and perhaps could there be made an Artificial Repo&s;itory or Magazine of
Strength, which for Weight and Bulk would not be too cumber&s;ome; 'tis not
<PB N="57" REF="91">
impo&s;&s;ible to fit a Pair of Wings for a Man to fly with, which may be con|triv'd
&s;omewhat after the manner of the long Fins of the&s;e flying Fi&s;h. Sup|po&s;e
Congruity be the thing look'd after, the thorough con&s;idering of the
Nature of the peculiar Species of it between Iron and Magnets, will help to cut
off many Circum&s;tances which divers In&s;tances in other Bodies do &s;eem to make
nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>18. Another way of Di&s;covery is, <HI>by inquiring after and diligently ob&s;erving
what middle way of Nature there can be found between tho&s;e extravagant and
the more common ones.</HI> For &s;uch as the&s;e &s;erve as a <HI>Vinculum,</HI> to conjoyn both
the&s;e together by &s;ome common Nature, which is to be found in the third,
and thereby hugely promote the Explication of both the other. As &s;uppo&s;e,
Congruity be the Nature &s;ought, the more common ways of Congruity are be|tween
divers Homogeneous Fluids and Solids that are immediately contiguous;
the more $are and &s;ingular is between two Load-&s;tones or two Magnetick Irons,
or between a Load&s;tone and Iron contiguous and at a di&s;tance, between the&s;e
too may be interpo&s;ed the Attraction of Amber, Jet, Wax, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which as they
&s;ometimes act at a di&s;tance when they are rubb'd, and al&s;o on the Bodies con|tiguous,
very much help to explain the Congruity both in the one and in the
other.</P>
<P>19. Another way of di&s;covering the Methods of Nature's working is, <HI>by ob|&s;erving
and comparing the Productions of Art with tho&s;e of Nature.</HI> And for
this purpo&s;e it would be very requi&s;ite to have a perfect Account of all the Pro|ductions
of Art, &s;uch as are di&s;pers'd up and down in &s;everal Trades and Occu|pations
of Men, whether for Profit or Plea&s;ure; and e&s;pecially all tho&s;e ex|cellent
ways of working on Bodies by Chymical Operations, &s;uch as Men&s;trua,
Mi&s;tion, Dige&s;tion, Fermentation, Di&s;tillation, Calcination, Fu&s;ion, Freezing,
and the like; every of which as they admit of a va&s;t Variety, &s;o do each of
them &s;erve as &s;o many Torches to light us in the dark Pa&s;&s;ages of the Labyrinth
of Nature, where the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the common Works of Nature, like the Ra|diation
of the Sun, cannot go along with us. For in&s;tance, &s;uppo&s;e we com|pare
an Automaton with an Animal, as I mentioned a little before by the by.
Or &s;uppo&s;e we compare Paper or Hats with the Skin of an Animal, becau&s;e the
Texture of tho&s;e two &s;eems of much Affinity with this, we &s;hall find the Me|thod
of Nature prettily explicated by them: For in both tho&s;e Artificial Pro|ducts
we find that the Arti&s;ts endeavour fir&s;t to cut, grind, or beat into &s;mall
parts the Materials they are to u&s;e, then to make them &s;oft, light, and &s;upple
with Water or other Liquor, then to di&s;po&s;e, place, or put it into &s;uch Forms
or Moulds as may &s;hape it into what Form they de&s;ign it, then they there &s;o
work and order it, that the Moi&s;ture may by degrees wa&s;te, and the &s;olid Parts
unite more clo&s;ely together, adding to it &s;uch glutinous Matter as may make it
fit to &s;tick, hold and grow &s;tiff, firm, and &s;trong together; and la&s;tly, by &s;e|veral
ways they &s;mooth and colour, or beautify the Surface: All which Par|ticulars
may be under&s;tood more fully by my De&s;criptions of tho&s;e Trades, and
the Explication of their &s;everal Operations, which I mu&s;t re&s;erve for another
Opportunity. Now Nature in preparing the Matter that does repair the Skin
or Fle&s;h of the Body, &s;eems to proceed much after the &s;ame Method, the Food
is cho&s;en, then groun'd or chewed, then dige&s;ted or brought into the Form of a
Milk or Froth, then di&s;pers'd over the Body, by degrees thicked, and la&s;tly
poli&s;hed. Now though every Particular does not exactly hit, yet there are
many that &s;eem to have a great Affinity, and &s;erve to prompt the Intellect,
and very much to help the Fancy and Imagination to conceive of tho&s;e things,
and of the Method of Nature, and they will &s;erve greatly to in&s;truct the
Mind what things are to be look'd after and examin'd in the Proceedings of
Nature: And the more Variety there are of the&s;e Artificial In&s;tances, the more
will the Mind be quickned to Inquiry, and the more taken off from Prejudices,
or an Imagination, that becau&s;e the Proce&s;s of Nature in one part may agree
with one part of the Artificial Proce&s;s; therefore that all the other parts of the
one mo&s;t agree with the other parts of the other, for when we &s;ee that even
Art can u&s;e the &s;ame Beginning, but yet very differing intermediate Proceedings,
<PB N="58" REF="92">
and yet at la&s;t by both produce the &s;ame Effects, we &s;hall find cau&s;e to think that
Nature may do &s;o much more. And therefore I might have added to Paper
and Hats, Silks, and Cloths, and Linnen, and divers other &s;uch Artificial Con|textures
which have every of them a differing way of proceeding to perfect the
End.</P>
<P>20. Another way of Di&s;covery is, <HI>by ob&s;erving where and by what means Art
cau&s;es Nature to deviate or alter its u&s;ual Cour&s;e, where it a&s;&s;i&s;ts, promotes and
perfects, and where it impedes, diverts, or de&s;troys.</HI> Of this there are Multitudes
of Instances in all things, about which Art has been u&s;ed, and therefore needs
not exemplifying; but certain it is, that this Method affords extraordinary Help
for Di&s;covery of the true Nature of the efficient and material Cau&s;es of things: For
knowing what in Art is able to change, and divert the Proceedings of Nature,
and what to &s;tay or promote them, it will not be difficult to find what they are
that are thus wrought upon, &s;ince it &s;eems very probable that they mu&s;t be &s;omewhat
of the Nature of tho&s;e in Art which promote them, and &s;omewhat of a
contrary Nature to tho&s;e that do alter and impede them. As becau&s;e 'tis found
by experienced Gardiners, that Artificial Heats ripen Fruit, 'tis not improbable
but that 'tis a convenient Degree of Natural Heat that contributes mo&s;t to that
Effect. Now as we &s;hould ob&s;erve diligently the Cau&s;es or Ingredients which
do co operate with Nature, &s;o &s;hould we al&s;o ob&s;erve in what Quantity it is
mo&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tant, by what Steps and in what Degrees it a&s;&s;i&s;ts the Circum&s;tances of
Time, Place, manner of Application, Operation, and the like; for without the De|termination
of the&s;e Particulars, the Informations will be lame and imperfect,
and nothing of Certainty can be built on them, for that which is a&s;&s;i&s;tant in one
degree, at one time, in one Place, or at &s;uch a Di&s;tance, is perhaps de&s;tructive
and pernicious in another: This will not only help the Mind to judge of what
the cau&s;e is, but the Degrees and Circum&s;tances of Time, Place, Quantity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>21. Another way of discovering Nature is, <HI>by ob&s;erving and comparing the Na|tural
and Artificial ways of producing the &s;ame Effects.</HI> For having the Artificial
way in our own Power, and being able to alter and change, and vary it: We
have much greater Helps to find out the true Rea&s;ons and Cau&s;es of tho&s;e Ope|rations,
and having found them in Artificials 'twill be very ea&s;y to apply them to
Naturals, and this way of inquiring where the Subject is capable of it, is the mo&s;t
ea&s;y of any I have yet mentioned, and the mo&s;t in&s;tructive, and does more im|mediately
inform the Sen&s;e and the Imagination with a true Idea of it, oblite|rating
and di&s;pelling dark and confus'd Notions. Thus, for in&s;tance, had we
not found an Artificial way of hatching Eggs by a gentle and equal Heat from
whatever cau&s;e it proceeds, we &s;hould have been very apt to have fancied
&s;trange kind of irradiating and pla&s;tick Influences from the brooding Hen to the
hatching Eggs, but by the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Experiment of hatching them in Dung and
Ovens, or Stoves, which has been tried other ways very &s;ucce&s;sfully in <HI>Den|mark</HI>
(as <HI>Bartholine</HI> affirms) and in <HI>England,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, with the gentle
Heat of Dige&s;ting, and Lamp Furnaces; and al&s;o by the hatching them oftentimes
in Womens Bo&s;oms, and divers other ways, 'tis evident that &s;uch Phancies
will ea&s;ily vani&s;h. Thus many People are &s;till very apt to fancy a certain at|tractive
Vertue in the Sun, which by a kind of Magneti&s;m does draw up the
fre&s;h Water out of the Sea, leaving the &s;alter part behind, and by that its Pow|er
does keep it &s;u&s;pended in Clouds: Whereas if we con&s;ider that any other
Heat to that Degree will do the &s;ame thing, whether the Heat be placed above
or below, or on one &s;ide or t'other, we &s;hall then find cau&s;e to think that 'tis not
an attractive Vertue of the Sun that performs this Effect, but that 'tis the Heat
of the Sun which working on the &s;uperficial and fre&s;her parts of the Water
warms them, and by degrees rarifies them into the Form of Air, which having
much heat and Agitation in them, do &s;o far expand them&s;elves as to make them more
rarify'd in <HI>Specie</HI> than the Circumambient Air, which being therefore heavier
than them cau&s;es them to a&s;cend in the &s;ame manner as Water makes Air, or
Oyl, or any other Liquor lighter than it &s;elf to a&s;cend to the Top. This way
does very much di&s;cover the naked Truth and Simplicity of things, by taking
away the Vizour under which it lay di&s;gui&s;ed. Much in the &s;ame manner as
<PB N="59" REF="93">
Travellers judge of the Beauty of the <HI>Persian</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Ladies, whom they ne|ver
&s;aw, by observing and examining such as they have more Liberty to &s;ee and
conver&s;e with.</P>
<P>22. Another way of di&s;covering Nature is, <HI>by ob&s;erving the difference be|tween
the Products of Nature and tho&s;e of Art.</HI> And without this Head indeed
the former way cannot be compleat, and therefore this has an immediate De|pendance
upon it: This way does farther a&s;&s;ist the Mind to find out and fix
the e&s;&s;ential Differences and Proprieties of Natural Actions; for by comparing
the&s;e kind of Ob&s;ervations with the former, we &s;hall be able to judge better of
the differing Nature of tho&s;e Operations, and what Propriety 'tis in the one that
makes the Work more perfect, and what 'tis makes the other mi&s;carry. Thus the
Rea&s;on why Rain Water &s;eems to be more plea&s;ant than di&s;till'd, &s;eems to be
partly from the Saline or Nitrous part of the Air which does &s;omewhat purify it,
and partly al&s;o from the gentle or moderate Heat of the Sun which acts upon
the Surface of the Water, and partly al&s;o from the greater Coldne&s;s of the outward
Air, which being therefore heavier does &s;ooner carry up the Vapours, though
but a little rarify'd; the di&s;tilled Water on the other &s;ide contracts an Empyreume
from the greater Heat, which is apply'd at the bottom, and &s;o the whole
is much heated, and from the Pentne&s;s of the Ve&s;&s;el, whereby all tho&s;e Parts
that ri&s;e, though many of them are Saline and Terre&s;trial, are driven over with
the Vapours, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall and unite again with the Water in the
Recipient; whereas in the Air they &s;erve to another purpo&s;e, for the Colle|ction
of tho&s;e Parts together at the top of the Clouds, and there kindling, &s;eems
to be the cau&s;e of Lightning and Thunder.</P>
<P>23. Another way of Di&s;covery is, <HI>by ob&s;erving the differing Materials, and
ways of producing one and the &s;ame Effect by Art.</HI> For this does mightily
free the Mind from Prejudice, and from being too much imbued with any one
Experiment or Method of proceeding, and each of them does much contribute
to the Explication of the re&s;t. Thus by ob&s;erving that the &s;pirituous part of
Urine may be extracted out of it, either after it has &s;tood a con&s;iderable time
to putrify, or immediately after the Intermixture of quick Lime we may learn,
that Putrefaction is nothing but a kind of Corro&s;ion or a working of &s;ome of
the parts of the Urine upon others, and thereby a &s;etting others at Liberty.
Thus the being able to make a very Volatile Spirit, and Salt with Horns, Bloods,
Fle&s;h, Hair, Hoofs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Animals, we may learn that all the parts of Ani|mals
seem to be much of the &s;ame Nature, but only diver&s;ify'd and dre&s;t un|der
&s;everal Textures and Schemati&s;ms; and by ob&s;erving that Spirit of Soot
yields much the &s;ame kind of Spirit, we may thence perhaps with &s;ome Proba|bility
argue, that the cau&s;e of the&s;e Effects may proceed from a Corro&s;ion or
mixing of the Salt of the Air with the Materials that yield tho&s;e Sub&s;tances;
the Operation of the one being made in the Chimney, and of the other in the
Lungs or Heart, though indeed that which &s;eems to be the Empyreume in all
Liquors may perhaps not improbably be &s;uppos'd &s;ome such thing as this Vo|latile
Salt, and may perchance be caus'd only by the exceeding Violence of
Heat.</P>
<P>24. Another way of Di&s;covery is, <HI>by ob&s;erving with what Circum&s;tances Na|ture
and Art doe &s;ometimes exceed one another.</HI> For the&s;e kind of Ob&s;erva|tions
as they di&s;cover the Excellencies of the one, &s;o do they al&s;o the Defects
of the other, and each of them contributes to the Explication of the other, and
do put the Mind upon Inquiry how to &s;upply tho&s;e Detects. For in&s;tance, that
Cry&s;tal and Diamonds are made by Nature of an Hexangular Pri&s;marical Fi|gure
perfectly tran&s;parent and exceeding hard. Art on the other &s;ide is able by
Decoctions and Evaporations, to make a Body &s;omewhat tran&s;parent, and of
the &s;ame Figure, but very &s;oft and brittle, and ea&s;ily either fufil or di&s;&s;oluble
again in Water, Namely, Salt Peter. This will prompt one to enquire what
may be the cau&s;e of the more perfect Tran&s;parency, and of the much greater
Hardne&s;s; that is, to find out by what means Niter may be &s;o ordered as to be
made perfectly tran&s;parent hard, and $ixt: Or el&s;e to inquire by what means Cry&s;tal
<PB N="60" REF="94">
may be made as ea&s;ily liquefiable as Salt Peter, and by what Men&s;truum it
may be melted away, as that Salt is into warm Water. Somewhat like the
former of the&s;e Inquiries may perhaps have formerly rai&s;ed in the fir&s;t Inven|tors
of Gla&s;s a De&s;ire and Endeavour to find out &s;uch a way, whereby the&s;e
things might be performed, and tho&s;e Tryals perhaps might produce Gla&s;s; as
I think 'tis not to be doubted but that by this means the tinging of Gla&s;s into
all kinds of Colours was &s;ought after and found. Another In&s;tance wherein
Art excels Nature, may be in Chymical Di&s;tillations and Separations which is
no where naturally done, and the Inquiry how and where this is or may be per|form'd
by Nature, may prompt unto us perhaps &s;omewhat of the &s;trange Ope|rations
perform'd in Animals, and &s;tir us up to examine whether tho&s;e may not
be Nature's Chymical Ve&s;&s;els; and to inquire al&s;o by what means tho&s;e com|bu&s;tible
Sub&s;tances that cau&s;e Lightning and &s;eparated from other Vapours col|lected
together, and afterwards kindled: A Collection therefore of all Expe|riments
and Ob&s;ervations that &s;eem to &s;hew &s;omething of this Nature, will
greatly quicken and excite the Mind, and inform it of what things are mate|rial
to be inquir'd, and what Circum&s;tances are very &s;ignificant and in|&s;tructive.</P>
<P>25. Another way of Di&s;covery will be, <HI>to enquire after, to try and enume|rate
how many mechanical ways there may be of working on, or altering the Pro|prieties
of &s;everal Bodies.</HI> For the being well instructed and knowing in the&s;e,
will exceedingly adapt and fit the Mind to trace the Method of Nature, and to
judge which or likelie&s;t to which of tho&s;e ways Nature performs her Opera|tions
inquir'd after; it will much rectify the Imagination, and take it off from
an Inclination to unconceivable and confu&s;ed Apprehen&s;ions of things. Thus,
methinks, the Operation of corro&s;ive Men&s;truums on Metals, or di&s;&s;oluble Bodies,
may hint to us a way how the Air may operate on combu&s;tible Bodies,
or &s;uch as are di&s;&s;oluble by Air exceedingly heated. Thus the Ob&s;ervations
that by the cutting off a part of any Stone from one &s;ide of it, does alter the
Center of Gravity, of it: And that a Mu&s;ical String, wherever it be &s;topp'd, if
it be &s;truck does make the longe&s;t Vibrations in the middle, may prompt unto
us perhaps &s;omewhat of the Rea&s;on of the changing of the Poles of the Mag|net
upon the paring off one &s;ide. Were this way well practi&s;ed, certainly Men
would not have &s;uch &s;trange, wild and unconceivable Notions of the Works
and Effects of Nature: For as it &s;eems to do nothing unintelligibly, &s;o are
there very many things that it manife&s;tly performs mechanically: For in&s;tance,
all Animal Motions and the In&s;truments thereto belonging. We &s;hould there|fore
endeavour to be acquainted with all the various mechanical ways of Ham|mering,
Pre&s;&s;ing, Pounding, Grinding, Rowling, Cutting, Sawing, Filing,
Steeping, Soaking, Di&s;&s;olving, Heating, Burning, Freezing, Melting, and the
like; of which there are various other Species, and each of the&s;e have Multi|tudes
of Individual ways, very much differing from one another, as many of
which as can be attain'd unto, &s;hould be under&s;tood and examin'd to inform
and regulate the Conceptions of the Mind, and to remove tho&s;e Puerile and
Childi&s;h Fancies that we &s;uck'd with our Milk, and learnt with our Lan|guage.</P>
<P>26. Another Help of Di&s;covery will be, <HI>to inquire out, and try how many
various mechanical ways there may be of &s;eparating Bodies joyn'd and mixt.</HI> Such
as Winnowing, Straining, Wringing, and Pre&s;&s;ing, Wa&s;hing, Di&s;tilling, Eva|porating,
Precipitating, Subliming, Cry&s;tallizing, Burning, Coppelling, Freez|ing,
Shaking, Knocking, and the like; each of which will furni&s;h the Mind
with their differing Circum&s;tances and Proprieties, &s;o as by comparing tho&s;e
various kinds of Separations in the workings of Nature, with the&s;e it will be
the better inabled to judge to which of them they have mo&s;t Re&s;emblance,
and will be better fitted to detect in what Circum&s;tances they vary, or are
differing from them; and the ea&s;ier under&s;tand what Particulars are notable
and what are not.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="95">
27. Another Help of Di&s;covery will be, <HI>to inquire and try how many various
mechanical ways there may be of uniting, and incorporating Bodies into one ano|ther.</HI>
Such as Jointing, Binding, Screwing, Pinning, Hooking, Shaking, Tum|bling,
Churming, Kneading, Melting, Di&s;&s;olving (for the Di&s;&s;olution of &s;ome
parts &s;eem caus'd by the uniting of others) to which may be adjoyn'd Burning,
in which there &s;eems to be &s;everal Unitings as well as Separations; Dige&s;ting,
Infu&s;ion, Freezing, In&s;olation, by mixing a third or fourth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by taking a|way
an Impeding part by Compre&s;&s;ion, by opening and divers other ways and
Methods, &s;ome of which are more obvious and vi&s;ible, others more &s;ecret and
ob&s;cure, and them&s;elves will need further Explications: All which ways
&s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, be well under&s;tood and reduc'd to a certain Theory, that &s;o
by that means other more &s;ubtile and curious workings of Nature, might by
the Help of them be more exactly detected and defin'd.</P>
<P>28. Another way of Di&s;covery is, <HI>to &s;eek after and attempt by tryal all &s;uch
ways, whereby Bodies are really chang'd from one thing to another.</HI> And for this
purpo&s;e it matters not whether it be from wor&s;e to better, or from better to
wor&s;e, or neither: For each, as to this De&s;ign, may be alike u&s;eful. Of this
kind may be &s;uch Bodies as are chang'd by all &s;orts of Corruptions, Vegeta|tions,
Animations, Vitrifications, Incorporations, Combu&s;tions, Dige&s;tions, and
&s;everal other Chymical Operations; or any other Mechanical and Artificial
way what&s;oever, whereby all or any of the former Proprieties or &s;en&s;ible Qua|lities
are really changed and de&s;troyed, and new ones generated in their Stead,
&s;uch as the Alteration of their Con&s;i&s;tence, Colour, Bulk, Gravity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> An
In&s;tance of this may be the Body produced by the melting together of Tin and
Copper, which make a third Body quite di&s;tinct in mo&s;t of its Proprieties from
either of tho&s;e other two; 'tas quite a di&s;tinct Colour from either; 'tis of a
Con&s;i&s;tence abundantly harder than either; 'tis exceeding brittle; whereas the
others are both tuff, 'tis much heavier in Specie than either of them, and &s;o for
divers other Proprieties, it &s;eems wholly differing from either of the two Ingre|dients
of which it is compounded.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, A mo&s;t general Help of Di&s;covery in all kind of Philo&s;ophical
Inquiry is, <HI>to attempt to compare the working of Nature in that particular that
is under Examination, to as many various, mechanical and intelligible ways of
Operations as the Mind is furni&s;ht with.</HI> For this will not only make the Mind
very attent, and earne&s;t, and circum&s;pect, in ob&s;erving, but will al&s;o hint
many con&s;iderable Circum&s;tances to be inquir'd after, and Experiments for
examining and explicating of them: And which is much more than either, will
hugely a&s;&s;i&s;t the Ratiocination and Invention in detecting the true Cau&s;es of
things. As burning compar'd with Di&s;&s;olution, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>These are &s;ome of the various ways by which Nature may be trac'd, by
which we may be able to find out the material Efficient and In&s;trumental Cau|&s;es
of divers Effects, not too far removed beyond the reach of our Sen&s;es, and
which do not very much differ from &s;uch Effects as are more material and ob|vious
to our Sen&s;es. But as for the Di&s;covery of the more internal Texture
and Con&s;titution, as al&s;o of the Motion, Energy, and operating Principle of
Concret Bodies, together with the Method and Cour&s;e of Nature's proceeding
in them: The&s;e will require much deeper Re&s;earches and Ratiocinations, and
very many Vici&s;&s;itudes of Proceedings from Axiomes to Experiments, and from
Experiments to Axiomes; and are indeed the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Philo&s;opher, and
not of the Hi&s;torian, the Method of which I intend, God willing, to handle
in the second part of this Phil&s;ophical Algebra; which explains the way of
making u&s;e of the <HI>Penus Analytica,</HI> of rai&s;ing Axiomes, and more general De|ductions
from a &s;ufficient Stock of Materials collected according to the Me|thod
of this fir&s;t part, with Integrity, Judgment, and Care.</P>
<P>Having thus pa&s;t over cur&s;orily the Methods and Means of Inquiry, we will
next con&s;ider the Manner and Order of entring what things are to be Regi&s;tred,
and in what manner, and to be rejected as u&s;ele&s;s or noxious.</P>
<P>In the making of all kind of Ob&s;ervations or Experiments there ought to be
a huge deal of Circum&s;pection, to take notice of every the lea&s;t perceivable
<PB N="62" REF="96">
Circum&s;tance that &s;eems to be &s;ignificant either in the promoting or hindering,
or any ways influencing the Effect. And to this end, as I mentioned before, it
were very de&s;irable that both Ob&s;ervations and Experiments &s;hould be divers
times repeated, and that at &s;everal Sea&s;ons and with &s;everal Circum&s;tances,
both of the Mind and of Per&s;ons, Time, Place, In&s;truments and Materials:
For all the&s;e do very much contribute to the Di&s;covery of Circum&s;tances. And
an Ob&s;erver &s;hould endeavour to look upon &s;uch Experiments and Ob&s;ervations
that are more common, and to which he has been more accu&s;tom'd, as if they
were the greate&s;t Rarity, and to imagine himself a Per&s;on of &s;ome other Coun|try
or Calling, that he had never heard of, or &s;een any thing of the like before:
And to this end, to con&s;ider over tho&s;e Phoenomena and Effects, which being
accu&s;tom'd to, he would be very apt to run over and flight, to &s;ee whether a
more &s;erious con&s;idering of them will not di&s;cover a Significancy in tho&s;e things
which becau&s;e u&s;ual were neglected: For I am very apt to believe, that if this
Cour&s;e were taken we &s;hould have much greater Di&s;coveries of Nature made
than have been hitherto. For I find it very common for Trade&s;men, or &s;uch as have been much ver&s;ed about any thing, to give the wor&s;t kind of De&s;cription
of it for this purpo&s;e; and one that is altogether ignorant and a Stranger to it,
if he be curious and inqui&s;itive, to make the mo&s;t perfect and full De&s;cription
of it. And the like may be ob&s;erved al&s;o in &s;uch as travel into other Countries,
that they will give a better De&s;cription of the Place than &s;uch as are Natives
of it; for tho&s;e u&s;ually take notice of all the things which becau&s;e of their
Newne&s;s &s;eem &s;trange, whereas a Native pa&s;&s;es over tho&s;e becau&s;e accu&s;tom'd
to them. I grant that a Native, or one that has been more accu&s;tom'd and
vers'd in a thing or place, &s;hall be able to an&s;wer Que&s;tions propounded much
better: But a Stranger &s;hall be be&s;t able to make the Queries; every Experi|menter
and Ob&s;ervator therefore &s;hould endeavour to be him&s;elf both the In|quirer
and the An&s;werer, he &s;hould indeavour to make him&s;elf as knowing
and as much vers'd in any thing he is to de&s;cribe, and to &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf as ig|norant
and unacquainted as if wholly a Stranger: For as the one will make
him inqui&s;itive, &s;o the other will inable him to &s;olve his Doubts. And that his
Attention may be the more weakned and rous'd, it will be nece&s;&s;ary that he
&s;hould look upon every Circum&s;tance as the mo&s;t &s;ignificant and e&s;&s;ential to the
producing the Effect, and to continue &s;o to do till he find &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to
the contrary, by having thoroughly con&s;ider'd and examin'd it: For though II
confe&s;s that this his Suppo&s;al will be often fru&s;trated, yet I dare a&s;&s;ure him, that
it will divers times al&s;o prove much otherwi&s;e, as I have very often found.
And 'tis one con&s;iderable Step towards Science, to know the Negative Proper|ties
of things, for by that means the Affirmative Properties are made &s;omewhat
more defin'd and circum&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>Now what I have here &s;poken of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Regi&s;tering Experiments.</NOTE> Attention and Diligence in making Ob&s;er|vations
and Experiment, the &s;ame I would have al&s;o in regi&s;tring; at fir&s;t let
all Circum&s;tances be entred as con&s;iderable, unle&s;s they are &s;o very obviou&s;ly
otherwi&s;e that they appear &s;o at the fir&s;t examining of them, but yet even in that
ca&s;e al&s;o 'tis good to be a little doubtful that po&s;&s;ibly &s;omething may be at fir&s;t
over&s;een, which being di&s;cover'd would cau&s;e other Thoughts and Opinions of
it; they can be ea&s;ily &s;truck out, as &s;oon as they are by further Ob&s;ervations
or Experiments prov'd in&s;ignificant, and if entred in few words they will not
take much room; be&s;ides there are very many things, which though perhaps
in&s;ignificant to the pre&s;ent End or De&s;ign, may yet be very notable to &s;ome
other. If it be found &s;uch, 'twill be very good when obliterated in one place,
to be in&s;crib'd in another, where at lea&s;t it may keep its place till &s;ome other
thing much more &s;ignificant to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, may give occa&s;ion to di&s;|place
it.</P>
<P>Now Ob&s;ervations, Experiments, or Circum&s;tances are not to be e&s;teem'd ac|cording
to the common Opinion of the World, nor are they to be look'd upon
as they are curious or not, or plea&s;ant, or &s;trange, or gainful, or &s;umptuous,
or e&s;teem'd by the great, the grave, the otherwi&s;e Learned part of the World,
or any of tho&s;e other kinds of Valuations which are put upon them for other
ends, and by Per&s;ons altogether unable to judge of their Significancy as to this
great and u&s;eful De&s;ign: But he that is a true Philo&s;ophical Hi&s;torian, will
<PB N="63" REF="97">
find quite other Rea&s;ons to advance their Value and &s;ix his E&s;teem of them.
He may perhaps &s;ee Cau&s;e to account tho&s;e the mo&s;t precious and rich, which
are generally e&s;teem'd the mo&s;t vile and &s;ordid; he may perhaps di&s;cover that
to be the riche&s;t Ambergrea&s;e, which another takes for Grea&s;e fit for naught
but to noint his Shoes: Tho&s;e things which others count Childi&s;h and Fooli&s;h,
he may find Rea&s;ons to think them worthy his mo&s;t attentive, grave and &s;e|rious
Thoughts; and tho&s;e things which &s;ome are plea&s;ed to call Swing&s;wangs
to plea&s;e Children, have been found to di&s;cover Irregularities even in the Motion
of the Sun it &s;elf. Other things which the Generality would account an Em|ployment
about Niceties and Trifles, he finds to be the &s;hortest and ea&s;ie&s;t way to
his Journey's end, and from the mi&s;&s;ing of the Hundred part of a Grain, perhaps
in his Statical Experiment, finds the Ma&s;s of Metal to be many Hundred
Pounds wor&s;e for Allay: And from the turning of a Straw, is able to fore&s;ee a
Change in the great Ocean of the Air. He ought therefore to fortify him&s;elf
again&s;t the&s;e kinds of Prejudices, which are too to apt to obtrude into his Mind,
and prepo&s;&s;es him again&s;t a clear View and Ob&s;ervation of Circum&s;tances as
they are in their own Nature, or as they are &s;ignificant to the De&s;ign of perfect|ing
Philo&s;ophy, and not to neglect or pa&s;s by any of them as trivial, or child|i&s;h,
or filthy, or ba&s;e and mean, and the like; but having always his main
End or Aim before his Eyes, to make that the Touch&s;tone, whereby to find the
Value of all his Inventions.</P>
<P>And as the&s;e things are not to &s;way him in the things of his own Invention,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Influence Authority ought to have.</NOTE>
&s;o neither &s;hould they have any Influence upon him, as to tho&s;e things which
he receives from others, Authority therefore &s;hould have no other Argument
of Prevalency, but as it was affirmed by an inqui&s;itive, judicious, and mo&s;t &s;trict|ly
veracious Per&s;on; one that is not found to vent Affirmations ra&s;hly or neg|ligently,
or for any other by Re&s;pect, but meerly for the &s;ake of Truth, and
becau&s;e he had by Ob&s;ervation or Tryal found it &s;o, or for &s;ome very con&s;ide|rable
rea&s;on believed it &s;uch; one that is very circum&s;pect in chu&s;ing and pla|cing
his Words, and that is not ob&s;erv'd to u&s;e too much the Superlative De|gree,
nor to be too confidently po&s;itive in his A&s;&s;ertion. Where&s;oever therefore
any thing is regi&s;tred upon the Authority of another, there ought to be put in
the Margin a C, a P, or a D, according as the Authority is Certain, Probable
or Doubtful: Nor needs there any other Naming &s;ince they are only to be re|&s;pected
according to one of the&s;e Con&s;iderations, or at mo&s;t nothing but the
bare Name of the Per&s;on. For 'tis not Epithets taken from Antiquity or No|velty,
or Honour, or Greatne&s;s, or Will, or Eloquence, or any other Learning
but Experimental, that will be &s;ignificantly added upon this Account: And
therefore a Philo&s;ophical Hi&s;torian &s;hould indeavour to look through all tho&s;e
Vi&s;ards, and to &s;ee only what Truth or Probability at lea&s;t he can &s;py under|neath;
be&s;ide, that &s;uch kind of Additions fill Space, and &s;o expand the Hi|&s;tory
into a wider Space, whereas it ought to be compris'd, as I &s;hall after|wards
&s;hew in as little room as po&s;&s;ible, &s;o as to appear and come under View
all at once that the Eye may the more quickly pa&s;s over it from one Particular
to another, as I shall afterwards more fully explain.</P>
<P>The next thing to be taken care of is the manner of Regi&s;tring:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third part of the manner of Regi&s;tring Natural Hi&s;to|ries.</NOTE> And this,
as it ought to be done as fa&s;t as the Experiment is made, and as &s;oon as the Ob+&s;ervations
or Circum&s;tances occur, becau&s;e of the Frailty of the Memory, and
the great Significancy there may be in &s;ome of the meane&s;t and &s;mallest Cir|cum&s;tances;
&s;o ought they afterwards to be &s;everal times reviewed and exa|min'd,
and rang'd into a better Method, and abbreviated in the manner of De|&s;cription;
&s;o that as nothing be wanting in the Hi&s;tory, &s;o nothing al&s;o be &s;u|perfluous
in the words. In the Choice of which, there ought to be great Care
and Circum&s;pection, that they be &s;uch as are &s;horte&s;t and expre&s;s the Matter
with the lea&s;t Ambiguity, and the greate&s;t Plainne&s;s and Significancy, not aug|menting
the Matter by Superlatives, nor abating it by Diminutives, not incli|ning
it to this or that Hypothe&s;is, or accommodating it to this or that Author's
Opinion; avoiding all kinds of Rhetorical Flouri&s;hes, or Oratorical Garni&s;hes, and
all &s;orts of Periphra&s;es or Circumlocutions, omitting the Citations of Au|thors,
or the Recital of Opinions, and Sayings, or the like; in the &s;econd Re|view
and Writing of which, 'twill not be ami&s;s to write it in a very fine piece
<PB N="64" REF="98">
of Paper, and to enter it in the mo&s;t compendious manner of writing that the
Hi&s;torian is acquainted with, &s;uch as &s;ome very good Short-hand or Abbrevia|tion,
whereby the whole Hi&s;tory may be contracted into as little Space as is
po&s;&s;ible; for this, as I &s;hall more fully explain in my &s;econd part, is of huge
U&s;e in the Pro&s;ecution of Ratiocination and Inquiry, and is a va&s;t Help to
the Under&s;tanding and Memory, as in Geometrical Algebra, the expre&s;&s;ing of
many and very perplex Quantities by a few obvious and plain Symbols: And
therefore 'twere to be wi&s;ht, that we could expre&s;s the whole Hi&s;tory in as
few Letters or Characters as it has con&s;iderable Circum&s;tances, &s;omewhat of
the manner of doing Which in my &s;econd Part.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e Hi&s;tories being writ in brief, in a &s;mall piece of very fine Paper,
'twill be very convenient to have a large Book bound after the manner of tho&s;e
that are very u&s;ual for keeping Prints, Pictures, Drawings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in, to pre&s;erve
them &s;mooth and in order: On the &s;ides of which, in the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e
Pictures are kept, it would be convenient to &s;tick on with Mouth Glew, or
&s;ome &s;uch Sub&s;tance in the be&s;t Method that can be thought of for the pre|&s;ent:
the &s;everal &s;mall Schedules containing the abbreviated and complicated
Hi&s;tories of Ob&s;ervations or Experiments, as they are la&s;t written on fine Paper,
for by the Contrivance of this Book, which for Brevity's &s;ake I will call a Re|po&s;itory,
not only all the Hi&s;tories belonging to any one Inquiry may be placed
&s;o as to appear all at one View, there being two large &s;ides of Paper to be fill'd
with the&s;e Schedules: But they may at any time, upon occa&s;ion, be pre&s;ently
remov'd or alter'd in their Po&s;ition or Order, that which was plac'd fir&s;t may be
plac'd middle-mo&s;t, or la&s;t, or tran&s;pos'd to another Head, or a little remov'd
to &s;uffer another to be interpos'd, the Convenience of which will quickly upon
Tryal be found to be very great, as al&s;o it has another Convenience that many
of tho&s;e Schedules which &s;eem to be of the &s;ame Significancy may for a time
be placed all one over another, and &s;o at la&s;t the choice&s;t and mo&s;t excellent
of them may be pre&s;erv'd and plac'd in their room, and all the re&s;t as &s;upera|bundant,
and in particular le&s;s &s;ignificant of the &s;ame thing may be remov'd
el&s;ewhere, of which an inqui&s;itive and diligent Hi&s;torian will very often find
great U&s;e. On the&s;e large &s;ides he may place them either according to the Me|thod
of the Queries, which he has at fir&s;t propounded to him&s;elf, or according
to their fir&s;t appearing Plainne&s;s, or Difficulty, or after any other Method of
Inquiry, or Proceeding, which every one will be be&s;t able to adapt for him&s;elf,
according to the Subject whereon he makes his Inquiry, or according to his par|ticular
Aim and Scope in examining it, or according to the Knowledge he has
already acquir'd in it.</P>
<P>As for the Queries which he at fir&s;t propounds to him&s;elf to be examin'd on
that Subject, he intends the Hi&s;tory of, tho&s;e will be mo&s;t conveniently written
either in &s;ome other &s;mall long Book, or el&s;e better in a &s;ingle Sheet of Paper,
either of which may at the &s;ame time be expos'd to the View with the Schedules
on the &s;ides of the larger Repo&s;itory, and as 'twill be no great Labour to write
over the one anew according as further Information &s;hall give occa&s;ion to add
or alter Queries, &s;o 'twill be much le&s;s to tran&s;po&s;e and range the Method and
Order of the Schedules in the Repo&s;itory.</P>
<P>Now becau&s;e oftentimes much more may be expre&s;&s;ed in a &s;mall Picture of
the thing, than can be done by a De&s;cription of the &s;ame thing in as many
words as will fill a Sheet; it will be often nece&s;&s;ary to add the Pictures of
tho&s;e Ob&s;ervables that fill not otherwi&s;e be &s;o fully and &s;en&s;ibly expre&s;t by
Verbal De&s;cription: But in the doing of this, as a great Art and Circum&s;pection
is to be u&s;ed in the Delineation, &s;o ought there to be very much Judgment and
Caution in the u&s;e of it. For the Pictures of things which only &s;erve for Or|nament
or Plea&s;ure, or the Explication of &s;uch things as can be better de&s;crib'd
by words is rather noxious than u&s;eful, and &s;erves to divert and di&s;turb the
Mind, and &s;ways it with a kind of Partiality or Re&s;pect: Be&s;ides that, it fills
up room, and occupies the Mind with the Ideas of things which are little
&s;ignificant in the pre&s;ent Inquiry.</P>
<P>And therefore all tho&s;e kind of Pictures of the outward Forms and Beauties,
and Varieties of the Species of Nature, are to be referred to another Head,
<PB N="65" REF="99">
where indeed they will prove very &s;ignificant, but to a peculiar kind of Inquiry,
as I &s;hall &s;hew more at large in my &s;econd part. All things indeed ought to
be regi&s;tred very exactly and defin'd and determin'd all according to their
Proportions in Number, Weight, Mea&s;ure, Time, Place, and Circum&s;tances;
but all in brief, and yet &s;ufficiently &s;ignificant.</P>
<P>Together with the&s;e Schedules of Hi&s;tory, 'twill be convenient to interpo&s;e
&s;mall Schedules of particular Deductions, or Conjectures, or Queries, or Cau&s;es
of Doubt, or receiv'd Hypothe&s;es, and the like; but the&s;e, as they &s;hould be
expre&s;t in a very few words, &s;o that they may be the more obvious, and may
thereby the le&s;s di&s;turbe the Mind in its Inquiry: So 'twill be be&s;t to have them
written with an Ink of &s;ome other Colour, as Red or Green, or the like; for
this will much a&s;&s;i&s;t the Memory and Ratiocination, as I &s;hall afterwards ma|nife&s;t
more at large.</P>
<P><HI>The Promi&s;e of our Author at the end of the foregoing Di&s;course of pro&s;ecuting,
and more particularly explaining the way of ranging Ob&s;ervations and Experiments,
&s;o as to make them more convenient for U&s;e, as occa&s;ion offers, was I believe never
performed: for I never heard or met with any of that Subject, and as to the
rea&s;oning part of his Philo&s;ophick Algebra, that likewi&s;e was not wrote, only
there is &s;omething to that purpo&s;e in &s;everal of his Geometrick Lectures read</HI>
Anno 1680. <HI>wherein he &s;hews the Excellency of the Method ob&s;erved by</HI> Euclid
<HI>in his Elements, which he enlarges upon; &s;hewing how from a few &s;elf-evident
Axiomes and Definitions, and</HI> Po&s;tulata ea&s;y to be granted, a va&s;t Structure of
undeniable Truths have been rai&s;ed, and that from the Method of not leaving
any thing undemon&s;trated behind, but &s;till proceeding on, &s;teadily and firmly a
Notioribus ad minus nota; <HI>which Method, if exactly ob&s;erved in Philo&s;ophical
Inquiries, the whole Pile would be founded and built upon &s;o &s;ure a Foundation
as never to be &s;haken. And in order to this, he prefers generally the</HI> Synthetick
<HI>Method as the mo&s;t in&s;tructive and perfective of the Under&s;tanding and Rea&s;on,
tho he &s;ometimes proceeds by the</HI> Analytick, <HI>Specimens of each of which will be
&s;een in &s;everal of the following Lectures, wherefore I &s;hall forbear to enlarge
upon them in this place, &s;ince the Prefaces to the particular Lectures will with
more Benefit inform the Reader what u&s;e he made of them: And likewi&s;e of what
U&s;e, if not Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> Theories <HI>and pre-conceived Hypothe&s;es are (contrary to the
Opinion of &s;ome Learned Per&s;ons) in order to the making more proper Ob&s;erva|tions,
contriving and ordering more convenient Experiments, and inventing more
fit In&s;truments for that purpo&s;e, the more accurately and nicely to determine whe|ther
the &s;uppos'd Theory be true or fal&s;e; all which Ob&s;ervations without &s;uch a
preconceived Suppo&s;ition, would either have been pa&s;t by unheeded, and &s;everal
material Particulars unob&s;erved, and Experiments wanderingly made; or as Chance
offered them, and not made with &s;o much Care and Circum&s;pection, and In&s;truments
and other nece&s;&s;ary Apparatus not well contrived &s;ord etermining the Enquiry; yet
he &s;till a&s;&s;erts all &s;hould be done with great Candor, and without Fondne&s;s for any</HI>
Theory, <HI>which &s;hould be taken up only to di&s;cover Truth, and as ea&s;ily laid down
again if found not agreeable to Truth. For a farther Account of his Opinion in
this Matter, I refer the inqui&s;itive Reader to the &s;everal places where this Sub|ject
happens to be di&s;cour&s;ed of, and more particularly to a Lecture about determi|ning
the Oval Figure of the Terraqueous Globe, and Encompa&s;&s;ing Atmo&s;phere,
whether it be an Oblong or a Prolated Spheroeid, and of determining the Que&s;tion
whether the</HI> Axis <HI>of the Earth's Rotation has or does &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, tho' very &s;lowly
alter, which Lectures were read the beginning of the Year 1687. and follow in their
proper place.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I &s;hall only as a Specimen of the&s;e Geometrick Lectures above-mentioned, give
the Reader &s;ome few Ab&s;tracts of &s;ome of our Author's Explications: Since I judge&punc;
it needle&s;s to publi&s;h his Lectures on that Subject at large, the Elements of Geo|metry
having been already illu&s;trated and &s;et forth by &s;everal eminent Per&s;ons
and that in different Methods, and the fir&s;t I &s;hall offer is what our Author has
delivered concerning the Definition of a Point, viz. R. W.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A Point is that which hath no part.</HI> This which &s;ome would deem the mo&s;t
incon&s;iderable thing in the World, &s;eems yet the mo&s;t difficult to be under|&s;tood;
<PB N="66" REF="100">
no Sen&s;e, or Imagination, or Fant'cy, can reach it, nor words de&s;cribe
it, but by a Negative, to tell you what it is not: For it is not to be taken in
the Sen&s;e, that the whole Earth is called a Point in re&s;pect of the Univer&s;e,
nor in the Sen&s;e that the End of a tapering thing is called a Point, as of a Pin
or Needle, tho' they &s;eem to be the &s;malle&s;t things we know, becau&s;e the&s;e la|ter
may be &s;aid to have as many parts as the fore-mentioned; for &s;ince all Quan|tity
is divi&s;ible <HI>in infinitum,</HI> the lea&s;t (Quantity may be divided as often as the
greate&s;t, and therefore whatever is divi&s;ible mu&s;t have Parts, and therefore none
of the&s;e can be properly called a Point, in the Sen&s;e here named, unle&s;s this
Point be under&s;tood to be the <HI>Apex</HI> of a Mathematical Cone or Pyramid, where
the Superficies of it is determined, for that will be a Mathematical Point:
But it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed of a Phy&s;ical Point, or Material Cone, or Pyramid,
for that will have Extension and Bluntne&s;s. And we find that Micro&s;copes
will make tho&s;e Points divi&s;ible even to Sen&s;e, nay even almo&s;t to di&s;cover a
new World in a Point, nay there is one now that affirms he has &s;een more than
10000 Living Creatures in the Bigne&s;s of a very &s;mall Sand, which it &s;elf in|deed
is but a vi&s;ible Point to the naked Eye, and each of tho&s;e 10000 may have Worlds
within them. We know not the Limits of Quantity, Matter, and
Body as to its Divi&s;ibility or Exten&s;ion, no Imagination can comprehend the
<HI>Maximum</HI> or the <HI>Minimum Naturae,</HI> our Faculties are finite and limited, and
we mu&s;t content our &s;elves within the Orb and Sphere of their Activity. And
acquie&s;ce in a Negative Definition, and under&s;tand if we can &s;omewhat that is
&s;maller than the &s;malle&s;t, though that be al&s;o improper; for in that which is
not Quantity, there is neither &s;maller nor bigger, we mu&s;t endeavour to under|&s;tand
&s;omewhat infinitely little, less than which there cannot be, &s;omewhat
that has no Bigne&s;s or Exten&s;ion, or Quantity, but only Po&s;ition and Re&s;pect
to Quantities circumjacent: From which, to this or that Body, there is a de|terminate
Length and Di&s;tance; and upon this account, wherever we endea|vour
to under&s;tand this Notion, our Imagination will repre&s;ent to us the &s;mal|lest
vi&s;ible Body, as an exceeding fine Sand, or a Mite, or the Point of a Nee|dle,
or the &s;mallest vi&s;ible Body we have ever &s;een on Paper, or the like;
which we mu&s;t be content with &s;ince the Fantcy forms nothing but what is
fir&s;t in the Sen&s;e, though it be none of the&s;e. And in truth it can have no
true Definition that will reach its E&s;&s;ence. Analogous to this Point, Sign or
nothing in Quantity is the <HI>Nought</HI> Cifer, or <HI>Zero</HI> in Number, the never in
time. The Re&s;t or Quiet in Motion: For as no Aggregate of Points will ever
produce a Line or a Quantity, &s;o the Multiplication of Noughts or Cifers will
never produce a Number, and as the Addition of Nevers cannot make time,
&s;o the Aggregate of Re&s;ts cannot produce a Motion. So that all the&s;e may not
improperly be called the <HI>Terminus</HI> or Bound, from which they all begin, &s;o
Quantity may be &s;aid to begin from a Point or nothing. Number may be &s;aid
to beigin from Nought Cifer or Zero, Time may be &s;aid to begin from Never,
and Motion to begin from Re&s;t: And as the <HI>Minimum Naturae</HI> may be &s;aid to
be the fir&s;t Quantity, if at lea&s;t there be a <HI>Minimum</HI> in Nature, &s;o a Unite
may expre&s;s it in Numbers, In&s;tant in Time, and Moment in Velocity. It may
po&s;&s;ibly be thought I have &s;aid too much of nothing, but yet it &s;eems to be of
the greate&s;t Con&s;ideration in Nature; for it &s;eems to be the beginning of every
Creature, even the greate&s;t Creatures having been traced to begin from an At|tom
or Point, no Eye or Sen&s;e can reach it, nor any Under&s;tanding limit it,
that the beginning of a very large Animal hath been &s;een alive 10000 times
&s;maller than a Mite may be proved, and yet how much &s;maller it may have
been is not determined.</P>
<P>Now as the&s;e expre&s;s Incomprehen&s;ibles one way, as to their Beginning or
Centrality, so the Incomprehen&s;ibles the other way which may be called Circum|ferential,
may be expre&s;&s;ed by Infinity, Aby&s;s or Immen&s;ity for Quantity or Exten|&s;ion,
Innumerability for Number, Eternity for Time, and In&s;tantaneous for Mo|tion:
But tho&s;e are beyond our Reach, and yet even of tho&s;e there is a nece&s;|&s;ary
U&s;e in Geometry; and without which &s;everal of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable De|mon&s;trations
both in that and Arithmetick cannot be performed, but of the&s;e
el&s;ewhere. When I come to con&s;ider Infinity and Innumerability, when I &s;hall
&s;how that innumerable Points do make a Mathematical Line, innumerable Lines
<PB N="67" REF="101">
do make a Mathematical Superficies, innumerable Superficies do make a Ma|thematical
Body, innumerable Moments make a Velocity, innumerable In&s;tants
make Mathematical Time, by &s;uppo&s;ing Motion joyn'd to them: For a Point
moved makes a Line in a Mathematical Sen&s;e, a Line moved makes a Plain, a
Plain moved that makes a Body, and contrary Motion reduce them back again,
which is expre&s;t or perform'd by Multiplication and Divi&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>I &s;hall beg the Candid Readers Patience to add one Remark more of the Doctors
on the Method of</HI> Euclid, <HI>and that is of his Method of Demon&s;tration, and that
in two very ea&s;y Problems,</HI> viz. <HI>the Prop.</HI> 1. <HI>and</HI> 2. <HI>Lib. 1. which I hope for &s;ome
Ob&s;ervations and Hints, particularly as to the Analyticks of the Ancients will not
be altogether unacceptable.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Euclid</HI> having premis'd his Principles, he begins his Method of Demon&s;tra|tion,
in which he takes no more for granted than what he hath already laid
down as ea&s;y and &s;elf-evident. His fir&s;t Propo&s;ition then is upon a right Line,
given to make an Equilateral Triangle. He hath defined in the 4th Definition
what he means by a right Line, namely, that which lieth &s;traight between the
two Extremes of it which are Points, and what he means by an Equilateral
Triangle, namely, &s;uch a one which hath all its three Sides equal to one ano|ther.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t Propo&s;ition is a Problem, which explains a way how to do and
perform the thing required, as well as &s;hews how to manife&s;t the Truth and
Certainty of the thing done: It contains therefore and &s;hews a double Inven|tion,
without which, or &s;ome &s;uch other thing, the Propo&s;ition can neither be
done, nor demon&s;trated; which Inventions are called Mediums or Means by
which we attain to the end propounded or de&s;ired. The end here &s;ought is how
from the ends of a Linen give to draw two other Lines each equal to the given
Line, which &s;hall meet in one and the &s;ame Point: It is certain that the&s;e
Lines mu&s;t begin from the ends of the fir&s;t Line given, but which of the&s;e to
draw fir&s;t, and which way, with what Inclination to the former Line, that is,
with what Angle, that is not yet known, and &s;ome Invention mu&s;t be thought
of how to direct our Ruler to draw it. Well, how &s;hall this be done, &s;ince
there may be infinite of Lines drawn from each of tho&s;e Points which &s;hall eve|ry
one of them be equal to this Line given? How then &s;hall we among tho&s;e
Infinite or Indefinite Number chu&s;e out the right? 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, without &s;ome Invention.
Our Author therefore helps you to one, and one which you have
already granted to be fea&s;able in the third Petition upon the Center a, and Di|&s;tance,
a b, draw a Circle, &s;ays he, b g c h f b,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 1&s;t. Fig. 2 d.</NOTE> what then? To what purpo&s;e?
Why this Circle then will give you a Line in which are contain'd all the
Points or Ends of the infinite Lines, which may be drawn from the Point a any
ways that &s;hall be equal to a b How &s;o? Why by the 15th Definition you are
taught, that a Circle is a plain Figure bounded by or contain'd within one
Curve Line, which is called the Circumference, to which every right Line
drawn from a Point in the middle, which is called the Center, are equal to one
another: But what are we yet the wi&s;er? How do we know which of the&s;e infi|nite
Lines we are to draw? To which of the&s;e infinite Points that are in this
Circumference? To know this, you mu&s;t do the &s;ame thing upon the Point b,
that is, upon the Point b and Di&s;tance b a. Draw or de&s;cribe the Circle a d
c e f a, which will give you all the po&s;&s;ible infinite Points in that Plain; to
which the from the Point b right Lines may be drawn equal to b a. Now then
&s;ince the&s;e Circles contain all the po&s;&s;ible Points of the Lines equal to a b or
b a, that can be drawn from a or b. It follows, that where tho&s;e Circles
inter&s;ect there only mu&s;t be the Point to which tho&s;e Lines may be drawn;
namely, at c and at f and no where el&s;e &s;oever: Drawing therefore Lines
from a and from b to either of tho&s;e Points c or f as a c, b c, or a f, b f,
you have done the thing that was propounded, namely, upon the Line a b,
given you have made an Equilateral Triangle a b c or a b f, which was de|&s;ired.
This is the fir&s;t part of the Problem, and indeed the difficulte&s;t to
find out; namely, how to do the thing required, and in this part lie the
greate&s;t Difficulties of Mathematical Knowledge, to wit, in the finding out the
proper and true Mediums or Means to perform the Problems requir'd to be
done, which for the mo&s;t part are of the &s;ame Nature with this, and con&s;i&s;t in
<PB N="68" REF="102">
the finding out the Po&s;ition of a Point; for this Problem might have been thus
worded. A right Line being given as a b; to find a Point as c or f, to which
Lines being drawn from the Points a and b, they &s;hall each of them be equal
to one another, and to the Line a b which is given; or two Points a and b be|ing
given to find a third Point, as c or f, which &s;hall have the &s;ame Di&s;tance
from a and from b that they have from one another. But our Author not ha|ving
given any Definition of Di&s;tance or Equality, otherwi&s;e than may be col|lected
from Equality of the &s;ides of &s;ome Figure, or of the Rays or Lines
drawn from the Center to the Circumference of a Circle, he chu&s;es rather to make
use of an Equilateral Triangle to find out that Propriety of a Point &s;o po&s;ited.
What ways the Ancients had for finding out the&s;e Mediums or Means of per|forming
or doing the thing required, we are much in the dark: Nor do any of
them &s;hew the way, or &s;o much as relate that they had &s;uch a one; yet 'tis be|lieved
they were not ignorant of &s;ome kind of Algebra,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I do not any where find that this was ever done by Dr.</HI> Hooke, <HI>and leave the V&s;efulne&s;s thereof to be con&s;idered by the Learned.</HI></NOTE> &startq;by which they had a
certain way to help them&s;elves in their Inquiries, though that we now u&s;e
be much confined and limited to a few Media. But I do rather conceive,
that they had another kind of Analyticks, which went backwards through
almost the &s;ame Steps by which their Demon&s;trations went forwards, though
of this we have no certain Account, their Writings being altogether &s;ilent
in that particular. However, that &s;uch a way is practicable, I may here|after
upon &s;ome other Occa&s;ion &s;hew by &s;ome Examples: Whereby it will
plainly appear how much more u&s;eful it is for the finding out the ways for
Solutions of Problems, than that which is now generally known and pra|ctised
by Species.&endq; But this only here by the by, our pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s being
to go through all the parts of this fir&s;t Problem of our Author. The &s;econd
part then of the Propo&s;ition is the Demon&s;trative part thereof, namely, to prove
from the Principles already laid down and granted and a&s;&s;ented unto for true
and certain, by a clear Chain of Rea&s;oning and Deduction, that the&s;e Lines
a c and b c or a f and b f, are each of them equal to a b, and &s;o equal to one
another; and con&s;equently that the Figure a b c bounded and limited by them
is an Equilateral Triangle, according to the De&s;cription of their Figure in the
24 Definition. The next thing then to be invented or found out is the Me|dium
or Means of demon&s;trating it to be &s;uch, for this we have two. Fir&s;t,
the Definition of the Proprieties of the Lines from the Center of a Circle to the
Circumference in the 15 Definition, that they are all equal to one another:
And Secondly, We have the fir&s;t Axiome, tho&s;e which are equal to one other
are equal to one another. Fir&s;t, a b is equal to a c, becau&s;e they are right
Lines drawn from the Center a to the Circumference b g c h; for by the 15
Definition, as I &s;aid, all &s;uch Lines mu&s;t be equal next b a, and b c mu&s;t upon
the &s;ame account be equal to one another, becau&s;e they al&s;o are Lines drawn
from the Center b to the Circumference a d c e: Therefore both a c and b c
are equal to a b, but by the fir&s;t Axiome tho&s;e which are equal to one other are
equal to one another, therefore a c and b c are al&s;o equal to one another.
Therefore the three &s;ides of the Figure a b c, namely, a b, a c, and b c, are
equal to one another, and con&s;equently bound an Equilateral Triangle accor|ding
to the 24 Definition, therefore upon the Line a b given an Equilateral
Triangle is made, which was the thing to be done and proved.</P>
<Q>The &s;econd Propo&s;ition is al&s;o a Problem.</Q>
<P>From a Point given to draw a right Line, which &s;hall be equal to ano|ther
right Line, given. For the performing of this Propo&s;ition, it being a
Problem, there is need of two Mediums to be invented or found out; the
fir&s;t is for the doing of the thing required, and the &s;econd for the Demon&s;tra|tion
of it, and both the&s;e are to be fetcht out of the Principles already agreed
to, or from the Truth evidenced in the preceding Propo&s;ition: For we are not
to &s;uppo&s;e any thing further known in this Science, and therefore much le&s;s
are we to make u&s;e of it. Searching therefore our Store, we have no other
Medium to make a Line equal to a Line, than fir&s;t by the Help of a Circle,
defined Definition the 15. which by the third <HI>Po&s;tulatum</HI> is granted to be de|&s;cribable
upon any Center, and at any Di&s;tance: Or 2dly, by an Equilateral
<PB N="69" REF="103">
Triangle de&s;cribed Definition 24, which we learnt how to make by the pre|ceding
Problem: For as to the equal &s;ides of an Equilateral Triangle, Defini|tion
25, or the equal &s;ides of a Square, a Parallelogram or oblong Square,
<HI>Rhombus</HI> or <HI>Romboeides</HI> de&s;cribed Definition the 30, 31, 32, and 33. Though their
Proprieties are there defined, yet we are not taught how to make them as yet,
and con&s;equently can make no u&s;e of them, as <HI>Media</HI> to perform the thing re|quired
to be done by this Problem: Nor are we to &s;uppo&s;e, that the length of
the Line given may be taken by the help of a Mea&s;ure or a pair of Compa&s;&s;es,
and tran&s;ferred to the Point given; becau&s;e tho&s;e are fir&s;t not mentioned in the
Principles laid down there which you are to make u&s;e of, and of no other, till
they be accepted for Principles undeniable: For 'tis not yet granted, that you
can with Compa&s;&s;es, take a true Length of a Line, much le&s;s that you can
tran&s;fer it and &s;et it in another Place. But you have granted that 'tis po&s;&s;ible,
upon a Point given at any Di&s;tance, to de&s;cribe a Circle, or &s;uppo&s;e it &s;o done,
which is &s;ufficient for the Demon&s;tration, that being the principal thing aim'd
at by our Author; Namely, to lay open to the Under&s;tanding, the Rea&s;ons and
Grounds of the Proprieties of Quantities &s;o and &s;o qualify'd, that you may
plainly &s;ee how and for what Cau&s;e things are thus or thus and cannot be other|wi&s;e:
For as to the mo&s;t practicable and expedite ways of doing tho&s;e things
Mechanically, and for other U&s;es, that belongs to another part of Mathema|ticks;
namely, to the practical Part thereof, which is called Practical Geome|try
or Mechanical Geometry, which ought not to be Learned till this be fir&s;t
known, but this which our Author treats of is Speculative Geometry, and prin|cipally
aims at Demon&s;trations or explaining the Proprieties of Quantities to
the Under&s;tanding. You &s;aw clearly by the former Propo&s;ition why a b c was
as equilateral Triangle, and why there could be but two &s;uch made upon the
Line a b in the &s;ame Plain; there being but two Points wherein tho&s;e Circles
cut each other, tho&s;e Circles determining all the Lines equal to a b that can
be drawn from the Points a and b. His way then of performing this Problem
is this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 1&s;t. Fig. 3.</NOTE> Let the Right Line given be a b in the third Figure, and the Point gi|ven
be c, from which Point a right Line is to be drawn equal to the Line a b.
Fir&s;t draw a Line from b to c, which is granted po&s;&s;ible by the fir&s;t Po&s;tulatum,
then by the former Propo&s;ition upon this Line, b c make an equilateral Trian|gle
b c d, then upon the Center b and Di&s;tance a b de&s;cribe a Circle, as a g by
the third Po&s;tulatum; then by the &s;econd Po&s;tulatum produce d b to the Cir|cumference
e, then upon the Center d and Di&s;tance d e, draw the Circle e h;
then as before, produce the Line d c to the Circumference f, then &s;hall c f be
the Line required to be drawn from the Point c equal to the Line given a b.
This is the Con&s;truction of the Problem, or the preparing of the Propo&s;ition
fit for Demon&s;tration, by which you may clearly under&s;tand the Rea&s;ons of
it, deduced from the few Principles already laid down: For fir&s;t, that a b is
equal to e b is clear from the 15 Definition, which determines the Propriety
of Equality of the Rays of a Circle. Next that d b e is equal to d c f, is as
clear from the &s;ame Definition, they being both Rays or Lines drawn from the
Center d to the Circumference e h by the Con&s;truction premi&s;ed. Thirdly,
That d b is equal to d c, is clear from the Con&s;truction; for d b c is an Equi|lateral
Triangle, two of who&s;e &s;ides d b and d c are. Now by the third Axiom
or common Notion, if from equal Quantities you take equal Quantities, the Re|mainders
&s;hall be equal; if from d f you take d c, and from d e d b the
Remainder c f &s;hall be equal to the Remainder b e; but a b is al&s;o by the
Con&s;truction equal to b e, therefore &s;ince by the fir&s;t Axiom the&s;e two Quan|tities
which are equal to one other Quantity are equal to one another; there|fore
a b and c f, being equal to b e, are equal al&s;o to one another, therefore
from the Point c the Line c f is drawn equal to the Line a b, which was
the thing to be done and proved.</P>
<P>Now though this way of Demon&s;tration and Rea&s;oning may &s;eem tedious
and too long to detain the Mind and Attention in the finding out the Proprie|ties
of Quantities, yet 'twas the way made u&s;e of by the Ancients. And 'tis al|together
nece&s;&s;ary, e&s;pecially in the beginning of this Study, to accu&s;tom the
Mind to Attention and Circum&s;pection, that it may receive nothing for Truth,
but what it &s;ees clearly by the Rea&s;ons and Cau&s;es of it, that thereby the
<PB N="70" REF="104">
Mind may acquire an Habit of Intention, and of examining the whole Chain
of Con&s;equents from the fir&s;t Principles to the Truth evidenced. For the want
of which, &s;ome &s;mall Error perhaps may &s;lip into the Mind under the Appear|ance
of Truth, and thereby make all the &s;ub&s;equent Rea&s;onings and Deducti|ons
un&s;ound; and 'tis very much harder to clear and free the Mind from it
when once received, than to prevent the Reception thereof. There cannot
therefore (in this Study e&s;pecially, not now to mention any other, where it is
po&s;&s;ible it may be altogether as convenient, nay nece&s;&s;ary) there cannot, I &s;ay,
therefore be as I conceive too much Circum&s;pection and Caution u&s;ed in ad|mitting
Principles, and furni&s;hing the Mind with the true grounds of Know|ledge;
becau&s;e for the mo&s;t part we are too prone to take up every thing we
hear upon Tru&s;t: Without Examination, we are too apt to run away with a
thing, and think we know it and &s;ee it clearly before we are &s;ure we do, and
are impatient of Delay in examining and con&s;idering, whereas if the Mind be
a little at fir&s;t accu&s;tomed to this lei&s;urely and &s;trict way of rea&s;oning, after it
has got a habit it will make as much Di&s;patch in receiving things with &s;uffi|cient
Examination, as another &s;hall without it. And the Patience only is need|ful
for the mo&s;t part, at fir&s;t, to beget Attention: Nor is it peculiar to this
Acqui&s;ition alone, but we &s;ee it nece&s;&s;ary, and practi&s;ed in many other things
where a good habit is to be acquired; as in Reading, Writing, Mu&s;ick, Draw|ing,
and mo&s;t other Manual Operations. The Roots and Beginnings of Know|ledge
and Practice too are bitter and tedious, but the Fruits are &s;weet and plea|&s;ant;
and who&s;oever attains the end, will never repent the time they &s;pent in
the beginning.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome Readers may think the&s;e Ab&s;tracts, out of &s;ome of our Authors
Geometrical Lectures, too prolixe; but I hope they will not by all be judg'd wholly
unnece&s;&s;ary, and u&s;ele&s;s, at lea&s;t I thought it not ami&s;s to give this Specimen of
our Author's Nicene&s;s, as to the admitting of things unproved, for real Truths:
But if this be a fault, I hope what follows in the &s;ub&s;equent Di&s;cour&s;es of the
Nature of Light, and other no le&s;s curious Subjects, will make &s;ufficient amends. <HI>R. W.</HI></P>

made u&s;e of for the Explanation and clearing of &s;ome Subject to which
it is applyed, and by Example therein to &s;hew of what U&s;e it may be

pitched upon as the fir&s;t and mo&s;t obvious, though yet the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e of all
others is <HI>Light:</HI> None that has Eyes can be ignorant of it, and yet there have
<PB N="72" REF="106">
been very few, if any, in the World that have hitherto under&s;tood and explain|ed
the true Nature and Cau&s;e of it. And though it was the very fir&s;t thing in
the World to which the Almighty Creator gave his <HI>Fiat,</HI> when he made the World, <HI>fiat Lux,</HI> Let there be Light; yet it may be po&s;&s;ibly the la&s;t and mo&s;t

this, &s;everal other Subjects, as tho&s;e of <HI>Gravity, Magneti&s;m, Rarefaction, Con|den&s;ation,
Solidity, Fluidity,</HI> and the like, will be demon&s;trably evidenced:
Now though Nature hath not furni&s;ht us with di&s;tinct and appropriate Organs of
Sen&s;e, whereby we may immediately be made &s;en&s;ible of all tho&s;e Opera|tions
and Workings of Nature, as no Sen&s;e informs us immediately of the Emanations of the <HI>Magnetical</HI> Vertue, no Sen&s;e immediately informs us of the In|&s;truments

which the Creator has furni&s;ht him with, to di&s;cover all tho&s;e ways and means
made u&s;e of, and to demon&s;trate their Proprieties and Powers as clearly, as it

<P>To repeat to you all the Definitions and De&s;criptions thereof in <HI>Authors</HI> that

not to have under&s;tood at all them&s;elves what they endeavoured to explain to others: Or at lea&s;t have treated of it in &s;uch general Terms, that in|&s;tead
of making it more intelligible, they have made it incomprehen&s;ible. Such
therefore I &s;hall omit to mention, the Science that they deliver being only
u&s;eful for Allegories and Similitudes, and Rhetorical Embelli&s;hments, and no
way tending to the Phy&s;ical Explanation of its Effects and Proprieties.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that the Nature of it &s;eems to be the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e of any thing
we yet know in the Univer&s;e; and though mo&s;t &s;eeing People do believe they
thoroughly under&s;tand it, yet if they &s;hall con&s;ider more attentively what their
Knowledge of it is, they will begin to think them&s;elves a little in the dark, and to
want &s;ome further enlightning to di&s;cover that which before they thought &s;o
evident, which will now &s;eem to differ from all other things in Nature.</P>
<P>2. But before I come to the&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Opinions of the Ancients.</NOTE> I &s;hall determine the Opinions of &s;ome of the
mo&s;t eminent Philo&s;ophers and Mathematicians, which we find either in an|cient
or Modern Writings, to &s;ee how far they have agreed, and in what they
have been deficient in explaining the true Nature of Light.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the&s;e I &s;hall begin with the mo&s;t ancient, as <HI>Anaximander, Anago|ras,
Leucippus. Heraclitus, Empedocles, Zeno,</HI> and the <HI>Stoicks, Plato</HI> and his
Followers. All which make Light to be Fire, or a certain Flame i&s;&s;uing from
the Lucid Body, as the Sun, which they &s;uppo&s;e the Fountain of Light, and to
be all Fire, Flame, or pure Light: And there <HI>Anaxagoras</HI> call'd it <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
a fiery Ma&s;s, and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> mo&s;t pure Fire, and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> a va&s;t
Ma&s;s of Fire. And where&s;oever there was Light, there they &s;uppo&s;e Fire,
which produced the Effects of Fire if it were den&s;e enough; but if it were not den&s;e,
it only made things vi&s;ible, and produced the Effect that we call Light.
This was their Opinion in general, but how they did more particularly explain the
Nature of Light do not now appear; &s;o that in effect we are as much to
&s;eek as to the Knowledge of the true Nature of Light as before: But&punc; 'tis but
giving of it another Name, and calling Light by the Name of Fire or Flame,
without telling us what that other thing is which they name. For who under|&s;tands
what they meant by Fire or Flame, whether the ordinary Fire of Wood, Coles,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> or an Elementary Fire, &s;uch as the Peripateticks afterwards &s;uppo&s;e;
or a third kind, &s;uch as the Ma&s;s of the Sun and fixed Stars, or neither of all
the&s;e: Becau&s;e they granted the Moon ri&s;es to participate of it, and yet hath
none of its own.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="107">
In truth we have no Information from it that is pertinent to this Inquiry I
am now about: For call it Light, or call it Fire, or call it Flame, unle&s;s we
knew the Proprieties and Cau&s;es of it, it comes all to one thing, it in&s;tructs
us not; for how come we thereby to know how this pa&s;&s;es from the Sun? For
in&s;tance, or from the fixed Stars, &s;ome Thou&s;ands of times further than the
Sun to our Eye here placed upon the Earth, in an in&s;tant? Which Light really
doth (as I &s;hall afterwards endeavour to &s;how.) How comes the Sun, or any
one, nay all the fixt Stars, continually to give out &s;o great a Quantity of
Flame, as every moment to fill the whole Univer&s;e; which is an Exten&s;ion or
Space Millions of Millions of Millions of times bigger than the whole Globe
of the Earth and Sea, and indeed incomprehen&s;ible in Greatne&s;s, and yet at the
&s;ame time the Body of it not &s;en&s;ibly wa&s;ted; nay, thus it hath done ever &s;ince
the beginning of the World, in every moment of time, and yet by the be&s;t Ob|&s;ervations
we can find recorded in Natural Hi&s;torians and A&s;tronomers, we cannot
learn that the Sun is dimini&s;hed in Quantity: So that let the Flame be
never &s;o much rarify'd, yet con&s;idering it mu&s;t fill &s;o infinitely va&s;t a Space
every Moment, certainly it mu&s;t have long before this have rarify'd this Body
all away, this therefore cannot be a true Explication of the Nature of Light. Be|&s;ides,
we are yet to &s;eek the true Nature of Flame, how that comes to make it &s;elf &s;en&s;ible
at a Di&s;tance: For though we &s;ee a Stick of Wood, for in&s;tance,
or a Candle, by means of Heat to be turned into Flame and to be con&s;umed thereby,
&s;o that the whole Sub&s;tance thereof by degrees is all converted into a
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive Body of Flame, yet how this comes to affect our Sight at &s;o many
Miles di&s;tance in an in&s;tant, &s;o that at the very Moment the Flame is kindled,
or extingui&s;hed; or di&s;covered, or covered, though at 10, 20, or more Miles Di|&s;tance,
the Eye at the &s;ame in&s;tant is &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e Varieties. Now who can
imagine, that the Body of Flame, which appears at one in&s;tant in the top of the
Candle, &s;hould at the &s;ame in&s;tant fill a Hemi&s;phere of the Atmo&s;phere 10,
20, or more Miles in Diameter, and yet it mu&s;t be concluded &s;o to do if this
be the cau&s;e of Light: For there is no Point in all that Hemi&s;phere, in which
if the Eye be placed, the Candle cannot be &s;een at the very in&s;tant 'tis lighted.
This Explication therefore is to me, I confe&s;s, wholly inconceivable, and is
complicated with &s;uch Difficulties as no true rea&s;oning can make it po&s;&s;ible
and intelligible, and therefore as an Ab&s;urdity or Impo&s;&s;ibility, I mu&s;t re|ject
it.</P>
<P>For as in pure Geometry nothing is to be let pa&s;s for a Truth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nothing is to be allowed in Natural Philo&s;ophy but what is &s;olid.</NOTE> who&s;e Cau&s;e
and Principles are not clearly &s;hown by the Progre&s;s of Rea&s;oning, and the
Proce&s;s of Demon&s;tration: So in Phy&s;icks Geometrically handled, nothing is to
be taken for granted, nor any thing admitted for a true Conclu&s;ion, that is not
plainly deduced from &s;elf-evident Principles, and tho&s;e founded upon the im|mediate
Objects of Sen&s;e di&s;intangled from all the Fallacies of the Medium
and Organ. To avoid then in part this unintelligible Expan&s;ion of Flame, &s;o
as to fill the whole Sphere of the true Medium incompa&s;&s;ing the Lucid Object.
Some later Authors have added, that this Expan&s;ion is only &s;uperficial, and not
&s;olid, and that the whole Medium is not at the &s;ame Moment compleatly
fill'd with this rarify'd Flame, but that the Momentary Emanation of Flame
from the Lucid Point makes a Spherical Superficies, which Spherical Super|ficies
by an almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous Motion expands it &s;elf every way <HI>in Orbem,</HI>
and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively becomes the Superficies of greater and greater Spheres, till it
attain the Extremities of the Univer&s;e, or be at length lo&s;t in the Profundities
of the Aby&s;s of Matter. For Explanation of which, they bring the Similitude
of the Rings or Circular Waves upon a &s;tagnating Pond of Water, for as in
that (&s;ay they) the Wave made by a Stone, or the like Body falling into the
Water makes a Wave, which very Wave you &s;ee expands it &s;elf and moves
from that place where the Stone fell, in a Circle that continually grows big|ger
till it touch the Extremities of the Pond, or <HI>Stagnum</HI> of Water; &s;o that very
Flame which is emitted from the Lucid Body, does by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Motion, but
yet very rapid, move it &s;elf from the Lucid Point to all the Extremities of
the Material World in a Spherical Superficies, which does continually grow
bigger and bigger, and that 'tis only a Superficies as it were that is at once fill'd
by it, and not the whole Sphere; from which Cau&s;e, &s;ay they, the Eye can be
<PB N="74" REF="108">
no where plac'd in the ambient Sphere of Matter, but this increa&s;ing Sphere
will affect it and move again&s;t it, and thereby make on it an Impre&s;&s;ion which
we call Light. Now the Body &s;o long as it burns continually emitting &s;uch
Spherical Superficies of Flame, which continually follow one another, with
the &s;ame, though it be an infinitely rapid Motion and &s;wiftne&s;s.</P>
<Q><L>Semper enim nova &s;e radiorum Lumina fundunt,</L>

<P>It follows therefore, that the whole Sphere mu&s;t al&s;o be fill'd with them.
This &s;eems to be the Theory which <HI>Epicurus</HI> and the <HI>Atomi&s;ts</HI> maintain, which
is at large explained by <HI>Ga&s;&s;andus,</HI> and our Learned Dr.<HI>Charleton.</HI></P>
<P>3. But the Difficulties in it are very great; for fir&s;t, <HI>Epicurus</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed that
all the Space between the vi&s;ible Coele&s;tial Bodies was a perfect Vacuity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The In&s;ufficien|cy of the Anci|ent Opinions.</NOTE> and
only made for the way of the&s;e Orbicular Superficies of Light, or Pa&s;&s;age of tho&s;e
Troops of Atomes of which the&s;e Orbs con&s;i&s;ted; for &s;o <HI>Lucretius</HI> in his

<P>Now 'tis hard to conceive how &s;uch infinitely &s;mall Bodies, &s;hould with &s;o
rapid a Motion pa&s;s &s;o va&s;t a Space in an in&s;tant almo&s;t, and yet mu&s;t conti|nually
in the way through every Point of Di&s;tance meet with cro&s;&s;ing Spheri|cal
Surfaces of Light from infinite other Lucid Points, and yet the Pa&s;&s;age of
them not to be at all impeded or &s;topt.</P>
<P><HI>2dly,</HI> 'Tis not yet proved, that there is any &s;uch thing as a <HI>vacuum</HI> in Na|ture;
and <HI>De&s;cartes</HI> &s;uppo&s;es that Exten&s;ion and Body is one and the &s;ame
thing, and that there is no where Exten&s;ion but there is Body, and no Body
but is extended; for which he brings &s;everal Arguments, not ea&s;y to be fully
an&s;wered, which I &s;hall not now in&s;i&s;t upon.</P>
<P><HI>3dly,</HI> Though it might be granted, that there were an Exten&s;ion without a
Body to fill it, and a perfect Vacuity; and &s;o the Atomes or Bodies moved
through it, will pa&s;s without any Impediment from this Medium or Space,
yet &s;ince we &s;ee that Light pa&s;&s;es the mo&s;t &s;olid Bodies al&s;o in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, or
in a Velocity rapid beyond Imagination, here certainly it &s;hould meet with Im|pediments
to &s;top it: For we find it pa&s;s through the harde&s;t Body in the
World, namely, a Diamond; and &s;eems to pa&s;s more freely through it than
through the Air or Water, or the mo&s;t Fluid Body, as may be gathered from
the greater Refraction of the Rays from the perpendicular in the more &s;olid
Body: Nor can I conceive how the Vacuity of the Pores of the Bodies can &s;olve
this Difficulty, &s;ince it will be hard to conceive how tho&s;e Pores can be alike
open every way to the Pa&s;&s;ages of the Atomes of Light.</P>
<P><HI>4thly,</HI> Suppo&s;ing there &s;uch a Vacuity or Medium not re&s;i&s;ting Motion, and
there were &s;uch Bodies as Atomes to be moved in it, yet 'tis difficult to con|ceive
how they &s;hould receive &s;o rapid a Motion from the Luminous Body:
<PB N="75" REF="109">
For no &s;uch rapid Motion is there in being. Now 'tis a Rule, <HI>Nil dat quad
non habet,</HI> that which hath no &s;uch rapid Motion cannot give it to the Atomes
that proceed from it. Now that 'tis not nece&s;&s;ary a Luminous Body &s;hould
have &s;o rapid a Motion, may be argued from the &s;hining of a Diamond in the dark,
only by gently &s;triking it with the end of ones Nail, as I have often
experimented, upon a large Diamond that had that Quality: Or from the &s;hi|ning
of rotten Wood, or &s;uch other cold Sub&s;tances which &s;eem not to have
any &s;uch kind of rapid Motion, and yet produce Light, which might be farther
in&s;tanced in the new <HI>Pho&s;phori.</HI></P>
<P><HI>5thly,</HI> If &s;uch a rapid Motion of fiery Atomes &s;hould be the cau&s;e of Light;
it would be very difficult to conceive, how &s;o tender a part as the Eye &s;hould
continually receive them concentrated in the <HI>Tunica Retina,</HI> and yet not be de|&s;troyed
and batter'd in pieces by &s;uch continual Volleys of Atomes.</P>
<P><HI>6thly,</HI> If there were &s;uch a con&s;tant Emanation of Atomes, and that it has
continued ever &s;ince the Creation of Light: Certainly this &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Inane,</HI> or
void Space between the Coele&s;tial Bodies, mu&s;t needs have been filled quite full
long before this, and then the free and i&s;tantaneous Motion of the &s;ucceeding
Emanations mu&s;t have cea&s;ed, becau&s;e they mu&s;t find their way all &s;topt up
by others, and con&s;equently by this time we &s;hould have had no Light at all
communicated from the Sun.</P>
<P>I could in&s;tance in many other Difficulties, as that of conveying the <HI>Species</HI>
of things, and the like; that this <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> of the <HI>Epicureans</HI> or <HI>Atomi&s;ts,</HI>
who did not under&s;tand the Rea&s;on of Vi&s;ion is encumbred with, which &s;eem
to make it impo&s;&s;ible, and unfit for the Genuine Explication of their admirable
Proprieties of Light; but that the&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, may &s;uffice at pre&s;ent for this
purpo&s;e, though on the other &s;ide there are many things that may be &s;aid for it,
that have not been hitherto urged by any I have met with. Some of which
I &s;hall have occa&s;ion hereafter to mention.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> was aware of the&s;e Difficulties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ari&s;totle's Definition of Light.</NOTE> and therefore goes &s;omewhat
more craftily to work in his Definition of Light: Giving you a Notion of it
in &s;uch general Terms without particular Explication, that you make almo&s;t
what you will of it, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Light is an Act
of a per&s;picuous Body, in as much as it is per&s;picuous. He affirms Colour to
be the Cau&s;e why a coloured Body is &s;een, and this Colour, &s;ays he, does
effectually move the Pellucid Body: But this Colour is not &s;een but with
Light, therefore &s;ays he, Colour in the Light does effectually move the Pel|lucid
Body, but Colour without the Light, though it be congenit with the
Pellucid, yet it doth not actually move the Pellucid Body; therefore, &s;ays he,
the Body mu&s;t be actually Pellucid that Colour may move it. Now it cannot
be <HI>actu</HI> Pellucid without Light, therefore Light is that which <HI>actu</HI> by its Action
makes a Pellucid Body: And therefore the Act of that pellucid Body is Light.
Now &s;ays he, this Light is not Fire nor any other Body, nor the <HI>Effluvium</HI> of
another Body, for &s;o it would &s;till be a Body; but 'tis the Pre&s;ence of Fire, or
&s;ome &s;uch like, in the Pellucid, and the Ab&s;ence or Privation of it Darkne&s;s:
From which his Definition of Light, I cannot I confe&s;s, well judge what his
Theory of Light was; for this Definition is only made upon one Effect of
Light, and doth not at all tell us under what <HI>Genus</HI> Light is put, nor what
are its Differences, nor what are the many Proprieties of it: So that the&s;e are
to be &s;ought el&s;ewhere. And when we have &s;een all he has &s;aid of Light, we
&s;hall find our &s;elves as much in the dark as before, as to the Knowledge of the
Nature of Light, he here con&s;iders Light only as it is in the <HI>Medium</HI> that con|veys
it, namely, in a Pellucid or Tran&s;parent Body, and &s;o $word$ he Act of
the per&s;picuous Body; but what this Act is, or how it comes into the Pellucid
he tells not, that you mu&s;t &s;eek for el&s;ewhere. However, though he has not
&s;o particularly and po&s;itively explained what he means by this Expre&s;&s;ion of
his; nor did perhaps under&s;tand any plau&s;ible or intelligible <HI>Theory</HI> of it, yet
to me he &s;eems to have light upon &s;uch an Expre&s;&s;ion as may po&s;&s;ibly being
<PB N="76" REF="110">
Mechanically and Geometrically explained, more naturally and truly make out
the <HI>Theory</HI> of <HI>Light</HI> than any other Expre&s;&s;ion or Explanation of any other, ei|ther
Ancient or Modern Naturali&s;t, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Light is the
in-working of the Tran&s;parent Body or <HI>Medium;</HI> that is, the internal Action
of the Pellucid or Tran&s;parent Body, is that which is the Light of which we are
&s;en&s;ible, or that Light which moves the Eye; And this <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> is nothing
but Motion, and this Motion is impre&s;&s;ed by the Motion of the Lucid Body,
and that Body is Lucid that has &s;uch a Motion in it: So that Light in the &s;hi|ning
Body is a peculiar Motion of it, which can communicate it to the tran&s;pa|rent
Medium, that is, to &s;uch a Body as is fit to propagate it, and Light in the
Eye is this Motion impre&s;&s;ed on the Eye, by which the Brain or <HI>Anima</HI> becomes
&s;en&s;ible of it. For if we con&s;ider all the Appearances thereof, we &s;hall at length
be nece&s;&s;itated to come to &s;ome &s;uch Conclu&s;ion: Nor can I conceive how the
Phoenomena thereof, can be by any other Hypothe&s;is but this of a propagated
Motion, be comprehended. And though even this be not without its Difficul|ties,
nor is it well conceivable how it &s;hould be, if we con&s;ider the almo&s;t in|finite
Difference between the Propagations of Light, and the Motion of any
other &s;en&s;ible Body: Yet when we more attentively con&s;ider and weigh all the
Effects and Proprieties thereof, and compare them with the other Effects, and
Proprieties of more gro&s;s, tangible and &s;en&s;ible Bodies, we &s;hall find that the <HI>Lex
$word$</HI> is the very &s;ame, by which both the one and the other Motions are go|verned;
and that there is here the &s;ame <HI>Regimen in Specie,</HI> though they differ
in Degrees.</P>
<P>5. The fir&s;t and mo&s;t difficult Propriety of this Motion of all the re&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Theory explained.</NOTE> is the
almo&s;t incomprehen&s;ible and unconceivable Exten&s;ion thereof; which is as
boundle&s;s and unlimited as the Univer&s;e it &s;elf, or the <HI>Expan&s;um</HI> of all Material
Beings: The Va&s;tne&s;s of which is &s;o great, that it exceeds the Comprehen&s;ions
of Man's Under&s;tanding. In&s;omuch that very many have a&s;&s;erted it ab&s;olutely
infinite, and without any Limits or Bounds, there being no bound &s;et; but it
may be conceived, that Matter may &s;till extend farther and farther continually,
being as infinite as Quantity, which is by all concluded to be &s;o, both as to
its Greatne&s;s and Smallne&s;s: The Limits of which, cannot be either conceived
or expre&s;&s;ed; for whatever can be conceived, may be expre&s;&s;ed and computed
by Mea&s;ure and Number. Now here no Number can be a&s;&s;igned, but there may
be given both a greater and a le&s;s: As Unity, let it &s;ignify never &s;o great a
Quantity, as a Foot, a Yard, a Mile, a Diameter of the Earth or of its Orb,
may continually be increa&s;ed by Multiplication or Addition, &s;o as to repre&s;ent
Tens, Hundreds, Thou&s;ands, Millions, and &s;o onwards of its Quantity. So
be a Unity taken for never &s;o &s;mall a Quantity, as a Foot, an Inch, a Line, an
Atome, its Quantity may be &s;till &s;uppos'd dimini&s;hable, either by Sub&s;traction
or Divi&s;ion; and &s;o a Tenth, a Cente&s;me, a Thou&s;andth, a Millionth part of
it may be conceived and computed. Now the Propagation of this Motion is
coextent with it, as I &s;hall afterwards prove.</P>
<P>To avoid the Incomprehen&s;iblene&s;s therefore of this infinite Exten&s;ion of the
Univer&s;e, and yet to make it as exten&s;ive as Quantity it &s;elf, <HI>Des Cartes</HI> has
found out a new Term or Expre&s;&s;ion for it, which he calls indefinite; which
Notion differs only from infinite in this, that the one has ab&s;olutely no Bounds
or End, and the other that it can have none a&s;&s;igned. But in truth, they have one
and the &s;ame Signification, and that is that Quantity neither hath any Bound,
nor can have any Bounds a&s;&s;igned to it by Humane Rea&s;on. And if Quantity can
have no Bounds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quantity boundle&s;s, or can have no Bounds &s;et to it.</NOTE> then Body and Matter can have none, according to the afore&s;aid
Author <HI>Des Cartes</HI> Opinion, Body and Exten&s;ion, or Quantity being the &s;ame
thing: So that wherever Exten&s;ion can be &s;uppo&s;ed, there al&s;o mu&s;t be &s;up|po&s;ed
a Body, and where there is no Body there can be no Exten&s;ion, and con|&s;equently
no &s;uch thing as a Vacuum or Space devoid of Body.</P>
<P>But whether his Notion be true or not, 'tis not much to our pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e:
For mo&s;t certain it is, whether it be finite or infinite, the Va&s;tne&s;s of it
is &s;o great that it exceeds our Imagination, to conceive of it truly as it is, and
who&s;oever has a finite and limited Conception of it, has a fal&s;e one not ground|ed
on Rea&s;on, but &s;ome precarious Opinion; for if we con&s;ider fir&s;t the va&s;t
<PB N="77" REF="111">
Di&s;tance between us and the Sun, which from the be&s;t and late&s;t Ob&s;ervations
in A&s;tronomy, is judged to be about 10000 Diameters of the Earth, each of
which is about 7925 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Di&s;tance of the Stars unconceivable.</NOTE> therefore the Sun's Di&s;tance is 79250000
Miles; and if we con&s;ider that according to the Ob&s;ervation, which I publi&s;h|ed
to prove the Motion of the Earth, the whole Diameter of this Orb, <HI>viz.</HI>
20000 made the Subten&s;e but of one Minute to one of the fixt Stars, which can|not
therefore be le&s;s di&s;tant than 3438 Diameters of this great Orb, and con&s;e|quently
68760000 Diameters of the Earth: And if this Star be one of the near|e&s;t,
and that the Stars that are of one Degree le&s;&s;er in Magnitude, I mean not of
the &s;econd, becau&s;e there may be many Degrees between the fir&s;t and &s;e|cond,
be as much farther, and another &s;ort yet &s;maller be three times as far, and
a fourth four times as far, and &s;o onward; po&s;&s;ibly to &s;ome Hundred De|grees
of Magnitude, &s;uch as may really be di&s;covered by longer and longer Te|le&s;copes,
that they may be 100 times as far, then certainly this Material <HI>Ex|pan&s;um;</HI>
a part of which we are, mu&s;t be &s;o great that 'twill infinitely exceed
our &s;hallow Conception to imagine. Now by what I la&s;t mentioned, it is evi|dent,
that Light extends it &s;elf to the utmo&s;t imaginable Parts; and by the help
of Tele&s;copes, we collect the Rays, and make them &s;en&s;ible to the Eye, which
are emitted from &s;ome of the almo&s;t inconceivably remote Objects: And &s;ince
we find, that &s;till longer and better Tele&s;copes do di&s;cover to us
&s;maller and &s;maller fixt Stars, which in Probability are farther and farther removed from
us, and that we cannot &s;et Bounds to the Extent of it; it follows, I &s;ay, that
the Exten&s;ion of the Propagation of Light is indefinite, immen&s;e, and beyond
our reach to conceive, yet neverthele&s;s we &s;ee by clear Induction that &s;o it
mu&s;t be, though we do not pre&s;ently well conceive how. Nor is it only the
great Body of the Sun, or the va&s;t Bodies of the fixed Stars, that are thus able
to di&s;per&s;e their Light through the va&s;t <HI>Expan&s;um</HI> of the Univer&s;e: But the
&s;malle&s;t Spark of a Lucid Body mu&s;t do the very &s;ame thing, even the &s;malle&s;t
Globule, &s;truck from a Steel by a Flint, which is as &s;mall as the Point of a
Pin. For that produces as real Light as the other; and all Light propagating
<HI>in Orbem,</HI> that Point mu&s;t do the &s;ame thing with every Point of the Superfi|cies
of the Sun. Now that every Point of the Luminous Superficies does emit
Light <HI>in Orbem</HI> through the Diaphanous Medium, is evident from this, that
there is no Point of the Ambient Tran&s;parent Medium in which the Eye be|ing
placed, does not &s;ee every Point of the Lucid Surface, and con&s;equently
every &s;en&s;ible Point of the Superficies of the &s;hining Body, does really propa|gate
its Light thus <HI>in Orbem.</HI> Nor is this to be limited to a Point big enough
to be &s;en&s;ible to the naked Eye; for by the Help of Micro&s;copes viewing a
Lucid and &s;hining Body, as a burning Cole, or a red hot Iron, or the like;
one is able to di&s;tingui&s;h Parts that &s;hine 1000 &s;maller than we can di&s;tingui&s;h
with the naked Eye, and yet the&s;e may be di&s;cover'd and are vi&s;ible, and con|&s;equently
mu&s;t radiate <HI>in Orbem,</HI> as the bigger and more &s;en&s;ible Parts: So
that hereby we are a&s;certained by our Sen&s;e, that the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible Point of
Body is able to affect the greate&s;t <HI>Expan&s;um</HI> of Nature. So it appears both to
our Sen&s;e and our Rea&s;on, and therefore we cannot doubt it, but &s;et it down
as an undoubted Principle.</P>
<P>6. But then &s;econdly, In the next place, this Propagation of Light which is
immen&s;e, is (in all Probability, and as far as Experiments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Motion of Light infinite|ly &s;wift.</NOTE>
Ob&s;ervations and
Rea&s;ons can a&s;&s;i&s;t us) infinitely &s;wift: Or we may &s;ay, that the Propagation
thereof through the whole va&s;t or immen&s;e <HI>Expan&s;um,</HI> as far as we can yet
find, is made in a Point or In&s;tant of time; and at the very In&s;tant that the re|mote&s;t
Star does emit Light, in that very In&s;tant does the Eye upon the Earth
receive it, though it be many Millions of Millions of Miles di&s;tant, &s;o that in
Probability no time is &s;pent between the emitting and the Reception; for with
this agrees all the Experiments that have been thought of for this purpo&s;e, and
no one has yet proved it temporary, though many ways have been thought of
for that purpo&s;e: And though the ingenious Mon&s;ieur <HI>Romer</HI> pretends to have
found a way,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Romer</HI>'s Ex|periment doub|ted whether &s;ufficient.</NOTE> by which he hath experimentally proved, that this Propagation
is not in&s;tantaneous but temporary, and &s;o there is &s;omewhat of time &s;pent in
the Pa&s;&s;age of Light, from the illuminating Object to the Eye or Body en|lightned,
<PB N="78" REF="112">
yet if we examine his Experiment a little more con&s;iderately we may
find rea&s;on to doubt, whether he hath from the&s;e grounds &s;ufficient to make
&s;uch a Conclu&s;ion. Certain it is, whether by it he proves the matter he aims
at, or not: His Ingenuity in the inventing the way was not le&s;s to be e&s;teemed
and valued, than if it had &s;ucceeded; nay, it is altogether as valuable, if by
it we could prove that no &s;pace of time were &s;pent whil&s;t the Light is propagated
&s;uch a determinate Space, as if it proved it to be momentary and mea&s;urable.
For in all Inquiries of this Nature Truth is the thing &s;ought after, and
the finding of that is the Reward of our Endeavours: And therefore I would
not be thought to examine this Ob&s;ervation of this ingenious Man, with any
de&s;ign to detract any thing from the Credit of the Ob&s;ervation, or the de&s;erved
Reputation of the Author. But that I may fir&s;t explain it to &s;uch perhaps as
have not heard of it; Secondly, that I may put &s;ome in mind of it, that per|haps
may have forgot it; and Thirdly, That I may excite both, or either, to
be mindful to make &s;ome farther Ob&s;ervations of their own of that kind, to
&s;ee if by any means they can thereby determine this Que&s;tion, whether the Propagation
of Light for &s;uch a determinate Di&s;tance, or Length, be in&s;tantaneous
or temporary: For till that be proved po&s;itively, the true Theory cannot be
proved, as we &s;hall afterwards &s;hew. His Way then which is printed in the
Journal <HI>des Scavans</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> and &s;ince in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the 136<HI>th</HI> Philo&s;ophical
Tran&s;action, is by the Light of the Sun reflected from the Satellit of &Jupit;, both
when it enters and when it emergies out of the Shadow of the Body of &Jupit;, by
which he endeavours to demon&s;trate, that the time that Light &s;pends in pa&s;&s;ing
about 3000 <HI>French</HI> Leagues, or 7925 19/83 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles, of 5280 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Feet to
a Mile, that is, in pa&s;&s;ing a whole Diameter of the Globe of the Earth, is le&s;s
than one &s;ingle &s;econd, or the 60th part of a Minute of an Hour.</P>
<P>But to con&s;ider a little further this ingenious Way of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Romer,</HI> I do
very much doubt, that we are as much to &s;eek for a true Theory of this Satel|lit
of &Jupit;, as we are of our own Satellit the Moon, if not &s;omewhat more, by
rea&s;on that the Anomaly thereof may be complicated with more different Mo|tions
than even this of the Moon, which is affected only by two Bodies, <HI>viz.</HI>
the Sun and the Earth; whereas I am of Opinion, that the Motion of this in|mo&s;t
Satellit may be acted on al&s;o by the other three exteriour Satellits, and
con&s;equently there will need other Equations and Allowances to be made in the
Calculation of its true Place, be&s;ides the Allowances for the Influences of the
Sun, and the Body of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which whether he did conceive or take any
Cognizance of, I know not: And therefore unle&s;s we are a&s;&s;ured of the true
intermediate times between the Eclip&s;es of it, we cannot make a certain Con|clu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing this may prove it to be temporary, and not in&s;tantaneous, yet
we find that 'tis &s;o exceeding &s;wift that 'tis beyond Imagination; for &s;o far he
thinks indubitable, that it moves a Space equal to the Diameter of the Earth,
or near 8000 Miles, in le&s;s than one &s;ingle Second of the time, which is in as
&s;hort time as one can well pronounce 1, 2, 3, 4: And if &s;o, why it may not be
as well in&s;tantaneous I know no rea&s;on, unle&s;s it may be &s;aid 'tis inconceivable
any Body can be infinitely fluid; which yet how it can be denied, I know not,
unle&s;s we will allow a Vacuity, which the great A&s;&s;erter of the In&s;tantaneous
Propagation of Light, Mon&s;ieur <HI>De&s;cartes</HI> will by no means admit. Now that
either there mu&s;t be a Vacuity, or an infinite Fluid, or el&s;e no Motion can be
made, every way, will nece&s;&s;arily follow from Geometrical Demon&s;trations of
the Proprieties of Figure: And therefore either infinite Fluidity mu&s;t be allowed
in Matter, or a Vacuity. Nor can this infinite Fluidity be evaded, by &s;aying,
that there is a Matter indefinitely fluid, becau&s;e if indefinitely &s;ignifies any
thing le&s;s than infinite, the Demon&s;trations holds good again&s;t it, as well as if
it &s;ignify'd finite. There is a nece&s;&s;ity therefore of admitting in Nature, either
fir&s;t a Vacuity, which impugns the very ground of the <HI>Carte&s;ian</HI> Principles, <HI>viz.</HI>
that Body and Exten&s;ion are the &s;ame thing; or &s;econdly, a Penetration of Di|men&s;ions,
which is likewi&s;e contradictory both to his and the Opinion of mo&s;t
eminent Philo&s;ophers in the World; or thirdly, a perfect <HI>Plenum</HI> but infinitely fluid, which I conceive cannot be di&s;proved. But being proved, I &s;hall after|wards
<PB N="79" REF="113">
&s;hew all the &s;trange and unconceivable Phenomena or Light will be mo&s;t
clearly and evidently, and mo&s;t demon&s;trably made out; and nor only the rea|&s;on
&s;hown why its Exten&s;ion is &s;o va&s;t, but why its Propagation is &s;o in&s;tanta|neous.
Now though I cannot now &s;tand to &s;hew the Rea&s;ons of the&s;e Con|clu&s;ions,
yet by a Methodical and clear Proce&s;s of Demon&s;tration they will be
&s;hewn to be as nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences from undeniable Principles, as any Con|clu&s;ion
made by <HI>Euclid</HI> in his Geometry, of which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak
more largely.</P>
<P>This being that we call Light, &s;ure if any thing may be call'd the <HI>Anima
Mundi:</HI> Its Action being &s;o near of Kin to that of a Spirit, the whole Ma&s;s be|ing
in an in&s;tant acted by it, and made &s;en&s;ible as I may &s;o &s;peak, of what is
done in any one Point: So that Light may be &s;aid to be <HI>tota in toto &amp; tota in
qualibet parte,</HI> po&s;&s;ibly with &s;ome kind of Plau&s;iblene&s;s. And yet after all this
we may prove it to be purely corporeal, and &s;ubjected to the &s;ame Laws that
bulky, tangible, and gro&s;s Bodies are &s;ubject to. This may inform us al&s;o,
how even the very remote&s;t Star, and every one of tho&s;e indefinite Number of
Stars may have an Influence every Moment upon this Ball of the Earth on
which we tread, and every one upon every other, and all in Proportion Mea&s;ure
and Harmony, &s;o they were made, and &s;o they are pre&s;erved, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</P>
<P>7. We come then in the third place to note, that this Propagation of Light,
whether it be in&s;tantaneous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Propagation of Light the A|ction of a Body.</NOTE> as mo&s;t probably it is, or temporaneous, and re|quires
a time &s;omeway proportion'd to its Di&s;tance, is not the Action of a Spi|rit
but of a Body, and that it is &s;ubjected to the &s;ame Laws that other corpo|real
Actions or Motions are &s;ubjected to, and con&s;equently is a Subject that
falls under the Laws of Quantity, and there its Proprieties may be a fit Subject
for Geometrical Exercitation.</P>
<P>And this appears fir&s;t, for that its Power or Action is always proportionable
to its Expan&s;ion; now this Expan&s;ion in a free Pellucid Medium, is in a Du|plicate
Proportion to the Di&s;tance it acts reciprocally taken.</P>
<P>The Actions of Light are fir&s;t, that effect it cau&s;es in the Eye, where it cre|ates
a Pa&s;&s;ion which makes us &s;en&s;ible of Light, which Effect or Action of Light
is &s;ometimes &s;o very &s;mall and curious, that we &s;hould no way have been &s;en|&s;ible
of it had not the Creator given us an Organ Pa&s;&s;ive by it, and &s;o fit to
di&s;cover it, and had Mankind not had that Organ of Sight, no other part of
our Body could have been &s;en&s;ible of that Effect, nor could it ever have entred
into our Imagination to conceive what way it were po&s;&s;ible the Mind or Under|&s;tanding
of Man &s;hould be informed of an Action a thou&s;and thou&s;and Miles off,
at the &s;ame In&s;tant that it was there done, nor though it were a &s;horter way that this
Information came, <HI>viz.</HI> 8000 Miles which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Romer</HI> &s;ays he
has proved, is pa&s;&s;ed in le&s;s than a &s;econd of time: We could have had, I &s;ay,
no Imagination concerning it, nor any Conception of the Po&s;&s;ibility of the Ap|pearance
of Light or Colours. Hence, To hint this only by the by, we cannot
conclude but that po&s;&s;ibly there may be many other Motions and Operations of
Bodies at a di&s;tance, and &s;everal other ways by which the Bodies of the World
may influence one another, though it has pleas'd God not to give us Organs or
Sen&s;es to di&s;cover them, and thereby many things that are accounted Sympa|thetick
or Magical may be done by Natural Cau&s;es and Powers, of which we
have no Organs to make us &s;en&s;ible. Now from divers late Di&s;coveries about
the influencing Powers of Gravity and Magneti&s;m, to name no other at pre&s;ent,
of which we have no Sen&s;e that does immediately inform us; but we become
knowing and a&s;&s;ur'd of them by other means, than immediately by peculiar Or|gans
of Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>Now this Propagation of Light doth act duplicately proportionate to the
Di&s;tance from the Lucid reciprocally;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Propaga|tion acts in a Duplicate Pro|portion to the di&s;tance.</NOTE> that is, the Strength of the Light at one
Foot di&s;tance from the Lucid Body, is to the Strength of the Light at two
Foot as four to one, and to that at three as nine to one, and &s;o forwards. So
that the farther this Action is propagated, the more is it expanded, rarify'd, or
weakned. To explain this, Let us conceive all the Medium incompa&s;&s;ing the
Lucid Body within the Compa&s;s of a Sphere of a Foot <HI>Radius,</HI> to be by the
<PB N="80" REF="114">
Power of Light in the Lucid Point, thrown out and opened into a hollow Orb,
which &s;hall incompa&s;s this emptied Globe of a Foot Diameter, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the
&s;hining Body. The Thickne&s;s then of this incompa&s;&s;ing Orb will be &radic;c 2&mdash;&radic;c
1. the Expan&s;ion of this Orb cau&s;es the fluid Matter that was in its place
before to expand into a bigger Orb: The Thickne&s;s of which will be &radic;c 3&mdash;&radic;c 2.
and &s;o onward. So that the Rarefaction or weakening of the Power of Light
increa&s;es in Duplicate Proportion to the Di&s;tance, and that this is &s;o does plain|ly
appear by Multitudes of Experiments, which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to make
u&s;e of hereafter.</P>
<P>Next, Though &s;o &s;mall a Degree of this Power or Action as does affect the
Eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Action of light carries with it a cer|tain degree of Heat.</NOTE> doth not move or affect the other Sen&s;es of our Body, yet is it not with|out
its effect upon other Bodies, be&s;ides that which it works on the acutely
&s;en&s;ible Parts of the <HI>Retina</HI> of the Eye; for we find, that it al&s;o doth produce
Heat, and every the lea&s;t degree of it carries along with it &s;ome, though it be
a &s;mall degree of Heat: Which degrees, if they are collected and concentred,
do produce very &s;en&s;ible Effects both upon the touch, and al&s;o upon most other
Bodies, whether fluid or &s;olid: For we find it to rarify Fluids, and to melt, burn,
and &s;hatter to pieces the mo&s;t &s;olid Bodies: And therefore though the rarify'd,
and &s;malle&s;t Degree of Light does not actually produce &s;en&s;ible Effects, yet
&s;ince the Con&s;tipation, Multiplication, or collecting of many of tho&s;e together.
It follows, that the lea&s;t Degree of Light has &s;omewhat of Heat; and that the
rea&s;on why it is not &s;en&s;ible, is only becau&s;e of its Smalne&s;s, and that it is be|neath
tho&s;e Degrees which are before actually in the Ambient, even as in the
Day-time we are in&s;en&s;ible of the Stars, becau&s;e the Light of the Sun hath al|ready
fill'd the Air with a greater Light: Not that they do then le&s;s &s;hine up|on
us than they do in the Night, for as I many Years &s;ince here &s;hewed many
of them may be &s;een at Noon-day, by the help of Tele&s;copes. And (as I &s;hall
afterwards prove more at large) there is no degree of Light, but has its de|gree
of Heat proportion'd to tho&s;e degrees of Light, which are concomitant to
the degrees of the Light of the Sun. To this many have objected, that the
Light of the Moon is &s;o far from being actually hot, that it is actually
cold, and the more tho&s;e Rays are conden&s;ed the more is the Cold augmented:
And to this purpo&s;e <HI>Wepferus,</HI> in his Treati&s;e <HI>De Apoplexia,</HI> relates a Story
how by the collecting the Rays of the Moon there was produced an actual
Cold, which was very &s;en&s;ible to the hand held in the <HI>Focus.</HI> But this he re|lates
not as tried by him&s;elf, but by another Per&s;on; but upon Inquiry further
concerning this Matter, I cannot $ind there was any &s;uch Matter certainly ob|&s;erved.
So that the Ob&s;ervation is &s;u&s;pected to have proceeded from &s;ome Mi|&s;take,
and the Per&s;on &s;aid to have made this Ob&s;ervation, would not maintain
any &s;uch A&s;&s;ertion, and therefore though it might well &s;uit with the Relator's
Theory, yet till we have &s;ome more po&s;itive Proof of Matter of Fact, and of the Curio&s;ity and Circum&s;tances of the Ob&s;ervation, I hope we may be di&s;|pen&s;ed
with, though we are not of his Opinion.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I have this to an&s;wer, That by divers Experiments purpo&s;ely made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Rays of the Moon have no &s;ensible Heat.</NOTE>
both by my &s;elf and divers others, we could not find that the Rays of Light
from the Moon had any &s;uch Power of Cold as is pretended; nor indeed could
we find, that they had any &s;en&s;ible degree of Heat, for having made the Tryals
with reflecting Concaves, which collected a great Quantity of the Rays, and
concentred them upon a Thermo&s;crope (which would be moved &s;en&s;ibly by a
very little Alteration of Heat or Cold) I could not certainly perceive any &s;en|&s;ible
Variation, though the little accidental Changes of Heat or Cold in the
Ambient Air, were very &s;en&s;ible by it; &s;o that what&s;oever may be pretended,
I am &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ured there is no &s;uch cooling Quality in the Light of the Moon.</P>
<P>Now that the degree of Heat, if proportion'd to the degree of Light, as in
the Sun mu&s;t be very &s;mall, and con&s;equently wholly in&s;en&s;ible to us will
plainly appear, if we con&s;ider what Rarefaction of Light is cau&s;ed by the Re|flection
from the Body of the Moon. And how &s;mall a Quantity of the Light
of the Sun, which falls upon the Moon is reflected to us: For if we con&s;ider,
that when the Moon is full, and &s;o all the Hemi&s;phere of it vi&s;ible to us, is
inlightned by the Sun, that the Quantity of Light which falls upon that He|mi&s;phere
<PB N="81" REF="115">
of the Moon is rarified into a Sphere about 228 times bigger in Dia|meter
than the Moon before it arrive to us, and con&s;equently that the Light of
the Moon is 104368 times weaker than the Light of the Sun; and con&s;equent|ly,
that there mu&s;t be 104268 full Moons to reflect a Light as &s;trong upon
the Earth at Midnight as the Sun doth at Noon day: And therefore 'tis no
great Wonder, if a 104368th part of the Heat of the Suns Rays is not felt by
us. This would be the greate&s;t Strength of the Moon's Rays, &s;uppo&s;ing no
part of the Sun's Light were lo&s;t in the Body of the Moon, but that all were
reflected; but then if a part of it be there lo&s;t, it will make the Di&s;proportion
con&s;iderable greater, and con&s;equently le&s;s &s;en&s;ible: Though therefore we are
not &s;en&s;ible of the Heat of that Light, yet we are not to conclude it without its
due Proportion of Heat.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Rea&s;on may be valid, why the Light of Gloworms, rotten Wood,
Fi&s;h, and the Late invented <HI>Pho&s;phorus,</HI> do not at all affect the touch with
their Warmth: For though that degree of Heat be proportion'd to their degree
of Light, yet their Proportion of Light is &s;o &s;mall, that 'tis not to be imagin'd
it &s;hould produce any degree equivalent to that which is in the Air that incom|pa&s;&s;es our Body.</P>
<P>8. This In&s;tantaneous Propagation of Light is in the next place in &s;traight
Lines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Propaga|tion of Light in &s;trait Lines in an homoge|neous Medium.</NOTE> every way from the Radiating Lucid Point, through a uniform pellucid
Medium. With this agrees the Judgment and Con&s;ent of all, both Ancient and
Modern Authors, that have written of this Subject, all conclude it to radiate
every way in &s;traight Lines from the Luminous Point, whether they &s;uppo&s;ed it
a Flame, as divers of the Ancients; or whether they &s;uppo&s;ed it a Flux of A|tomes,
as the <HI>Epicureans,</HI> or Species, as the <HI>Peripateticks,</HI> or the Motion of a
&s;tagnant Body, as the <HI>Carte&s;ians,</HI> and our Country-man Mr. <HI>Hobbs;</HI> they all
&s;uppo&s;ed it to pa&s;s in &s;traight Lines, though &s;ome of them &s;uppo&s;ed tho&s;e Lines
to be but Phy&s;ically &s;uch, that is, &s;o that the whole made a &s;traight Line,
though the imperceptible parts thereof might be a little bended by the Po&s;ition
of the Pores, as the Atomi&s;ts &s;uppos'd, or by the Form of the con&s;tituent Parts
of the pellucid <HI>Medium;</HI> as the <HI>Carte&s;ians,</HI> who imagined the &s;aid <HI>Medium</HI> to
con&s;i&s;t of &s;mall Globules contiguous to each other. And with this al&s;o agree
all Ob&s;ervations both in the Heavens, and on the Earth, nor have any Experi|ments
or Observations hitherto contradicted it. Now though the Propagation
of Light at a great Distance &s;hould be temporaneous, and &s;o be &s;ome con&s;ide|rable
time in coming from the Luminous Body to the Eye, and thence that the
Morning Object &s;hould not be in the &s;ame place that it appears to the Eye, yet
this hinders not but that; that temporaneous Propagation may &s;till be made in
a &s;traight Line, there being no Cau&s;e a&s;&s;ignable in a uniform &s;tagnant Medium
why it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>But then this hinders not, but that this &s;traight Line may be bent by a Difform Medium.</P>
<P>In the next place therefore, the Propagation of Light is various ways affect|ed,
and &s;o the Straightne&s;s of the Rays is changed and diverted another way.</P>
<P>1<HI>&s;t.</HI> By a Medium not uniform and homogeneous, the Ray is bent from a
&s;traight Line into a Curv$,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By a Difform Medium the Ray is bent in|to a Curve.</NOTE> which I have long &s;ince proved by many Ob&s;erva|tions
and Experiments, and publi&s;hed in the Year 1664. This Pa&s;&s;ion of Light
from a difform <HI>Medium,</HI> I have called <HI>Inflection;</HI> and &s;hall hereafter have oc|ca&s;ion
more fully to treat of it.</P>
<P>2<HI>ly,</HI> The Straightne&s;s of the way of Propagation is broken, &s;hort as it were,
and diverted another way by its pa&s;&s;ing out of one uniform Medium into ano|ther
uniform <HI>Medium.</HI> This is call'd <HI>Refraction</HI> of the Ray, whereby the
&s;traight Line of Propagation is at the Superficies of the two contiguous transpa|rent
<HI>Mediums</HI> diverted &s;ome other way within the &s;econd <HI>Medium,</HI> which
makes an Angle at the Superficies w the former Rays contiuued.</P>
<P>3<HI>ly,</HI> The Ray is broken and diverted another way by its meeting with a <HI>Me|dium</HI>
unfit for admitting the Propagation of Light through it &s;elf, and thereby
the Ray is kept within the fir&s;t Medium, but at the <HI>Superficies</HI> is with an An|gle
diverted and bent &s;hort another way, this is called Reflection.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="116">
4<HI>ly,</HI> The Ray is impeded, &s;topp'd, deaded, or ab&s;orpt by meeting with a
Body unfit either to propagate it through it &s;elf, or reflect it into the fir&s;t <HI>Me|dium,</HI>
which may be called Mortification or Extinction, of this kind are blank

<Q>1. The true Method of acquiring Knowledge, is fir&s;t by examining the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
that it is &s;o, and then the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> why it is &s;o. 2. The Bodies from
whence Light proceeds, as fir&s;t the Sun; its va&s;t Bigne&s;s and Distance
from the Earth, emits Rays every way equally in Orbem, is &s;ubject to
Changes from its. Spots which are at large de&s;cribed; with their Mo|tions
and Nature, and of the Sun's Rotation. 3. That the Rays of the
Sun carry Heat as well as Light, that the Sun has Heat really, and
that it is not produced by the Reflexion of the Rays from the Earth;
why the upper Air colder. 4. That the Sun is incompa&s;&s;ed with an At|mo&s;phere,
or &s;omething analogous to it, the Limb which appears to us
is that of the Atmo&s;phere, more of the Spots: The Sun agrees with the
Earth in mo&s;t Particulars except Light, why the Light of the Sun is
mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted on. 5. Farther Rea&s;ons that there mu&s;t be a fluid Body
incompa&s;&s;ing the Sun, with a farther Explication of the Spots, that they
are not Planets like the Body of Venus or Mercury in Sole, tho' there
may po&s;&s;ibly be Planets nearer the Sun than them which the Author &s;ees
no rea&s;on to believe, the&s;e Spots are within the Atmo&s;phere of the Sun,
and much of the Nature of Meteors, a farther Confirmation that there
is a &s;mall tran&s;parent Shell or Atmo&s;phere about the Sun. 6. That
within this Shell is a &s;olid Opaque Body, &s;olid from its Rotation, Fix|edne&s;s
of its Axis, and its Power of Gravitation, Opaque from the
Spots not appearing thro' it. 7. Eight Particulars, wherein the Sun
and Earth agree, and three wherein they differ. 8. Suppo&s;ing the Sun
compo&s;ed of Nitrous and Sulphureous Particles, and &s;et on Fire, all the
Phenomena thereof may be explained, the Proportion of the Diminution
of the Action of Light in Proportion to the Di&s;tance from the Lumincus
Body demon&s;trated, and that the Light of the Sun is from an actual
Fire, or Di&s;&s;olution of the Superficial Parts thereof, with an Objection
again&s;t it an&s;wered. R. W.</Q>
<P>1. I Have begun in my former Lectures to enumerate and explain to you
&s;ome of the Proprieties of Light, and to ob&s;erve to you what it effects
and performs, which I have done in order to &s;hew how, and by what means
they are performed, and from what Cau&s;es tho&s;e Effects proceed. First, to ex|plain
to you the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and &s;hew you that &s;o and &s;o it is, and then the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, how
and why it is &s;o.</P>
<P>This is the true Method of coming to the Knowledge of all the Operations
of Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The $span$.</NOTE> and therefore whoever goes the other way to work, and begins <HI>a
Priori</HI> to this fir&s;t of the Cau&s;e, and then to deduce the Effects from it, as a
<PB N="84" REF="118">
great Man has done, or at lea&s;t would be thought &s;o to have done; begins at
the wrong end, and at length when he came to the ultimate and mo&s;t vi&s;ible
Effects, he found him&s;elf, or at lea&s;t mo&s;t Men have found it for him, that
he was much at a lo&s;s and unable to get out, and extricate him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Works of Nature are a great Labyrinth, which is already built and per|fected,
their ways are determined and bounded by impenetrable Walls; and
there are no new Pa&s;&s;ages to be made, other than what are already fixt: He
therefore that &s;hall think immediately to fly and tran&s;port him&s;elf over the&s;e
Walls, and &s;et him&s;elf in the very middle and inmo&s;t Rece&s;s of it, and thence
think him&s;elf able to know all the Meanders and Turnings, and Pa&s;&s;ages back
again to get out; will find him&s;elf hugely mi&s;taken and puzled in finding his
way out again.</P>
<P>Whereas he, that would march &s;ecure, mu&s;t fir&s;t find &s;ome open and vi&s;ible
Entry, and there enter with his Clew and his In&s;truments, and take notice of
what Turnings and Pa&s;&s;ages he finds, and &s;ee how far he can proceed in this
and that way, before he finds a <HI>ne plus ultra;</HI> then &s;etting down and protract|ing
all the ways he has there gone, and what he has there met withal, he mu&s;t
return by the help of his Clew and try another Pa&s;&s;age, and do as much there,
and &s;o a third and a fourth, and &s;o onward, &s;etting down &s;till and protracting
his &s;everal E&s;&s;ays; by comparing of all which together, he will at la&s;t be able
to give you the true Ground plat of the whole Labyrinth, and thereby to tell
you which is the right and which is the wrong way to find the middle or Cen|ter:
Which is the neare&s;t and which is the farthe&s;t way about, which is the
plaine&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t, and which the ruggede&s;t and the mo&s;t difficulte&s;t, which
the lighte&s;t, and which the darke&s;t Pa&s;&s;age, and all the Occurences you will
meet withal in the ways.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t of our Philo&s;ophers that have hitherto written, have gone the o|ther
way to work. They have begun from &s;ome inward part of the Labyrinth,
having made &s;ome &s;mall Entrance, and have thence thought they knew the
whole Fabrick, and to have found the way out again by the help of their Me|mories,
neglecting or de&s;pi&s;ing the Clew, the Compa&s;s, the Circumferenter,
and the Chain, whereby to ob&s;erve Mea&s;ure, and &s;et down all they ob&s;erved in
their way: And have thereupon feigned a way, and have made to them&s;elves
a Labyrinth, and have pre&s;ently given you a De&s;ign of the whole. But alas;
this Labyrinth was in their own Mind, and not of Nature's making, and how
perfect &s;oever they are in their own Method, they are altogether to &s;eek in
that of Nature.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Pythagoreans</HI> were puzled with their Numbers; the <HI>Peripateticks</HI>
with their Four Elements; the <HI>Epicureans</HI> with their Atoms; the <HI>Chymi&s;ts</HI> with
their three Principles, Salt, Sulphur, Mercury; <HI>Ptolomy</HI> with his Orbs and
Epicycles; <HI>Kepler</HI> with his Harmonicks; <HI>Guilbert</HI> with his Magneti&s;ms; not
to name many of the Ancients, &s;ome whereof would reduce all from Fire, o|thers
from Air, and others from Water, &s;ome from Heat and Cold, others from
Light and Darkne&s;s, others from Good and Evil, but all fell &s;hort of the true
Explication of Nature.</P>
<P>He therefore that would make $ thorough Di&s;covery, mu&s;t begin from the
mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible, obvious and plain Effects of Nature; of the&s;e he mu&s;t make a
diligent Inquiry, fir&s;t what is done, and then as near as may be how 'tis
done.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent Inquiry therefore being after the Nature of Light: To proceed ac|cording
to the Method I have now been &s;peaking of to you, we mu&s;t fir&s;t inquire
and &s;earch on the out&s;ide of this Labyrinth, and &s;ee what Entrances or Inlets
there are by which we penetrate into it; that is, we mu&s;t inquire what are
the mo&s;t obvious and &s;en&s;ible Effects of it: The&s;e mu&s;t be all, if po&s;&s;ible, found
out, enumerated, and &s;et down. Secondly, Every one of the&s;e again mu&s;t be
more &s;trictly examined, determined, and &s;tated, and the Limits &s;et, its <HI>Maxi|mum</HI>
and <HI>Minimum</HI> demon&s;trated; its comparative Likene&s;s and Unlikene&s;s to
the Proprieties of other Subjects taken notice of, and recorded; its Congru|ents
or Opponents, or its Promoters or Retarders; its Contraries and De&s;troy|ers;
and the like mu&s;t al&s;o be examined, and all the&s;e mu&s;t be Methodically
Di&s;po&s;ed and Regi&s;tred into fit Tables, that &s;o out of the&s;e &s;ound Materials
<PB N="85" REF="119">
cho&s;en with Judgment, examined with Strictne&s;s, clean&s;ed and fitted with
great Sedulity and Rea&s;onings, we may rai&s;e a &s;ound and la&s;ting Structure
that no Age or right Rea&s;on &s;hall overthrow or de&s;troy.</P>
<P>Such are the Fabricks rai&s;ed by Geometry, thus <HI>Euclid</HI>'s and <HI>Archimede</HI>'s De|mon&s;trations,
none &s;ince have been able to di&s;prove. This Learning which was
&s;aid to have been brought fir&s;t out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> was po&s;&s;ibly known before the Py|ramids
were built, and may la&s;t when not a Du&s;t of tho&s;e ma&s;&s;y Piles may be
left undevoured by Time; for Truth always was, is, and ever will be the
&s;ame.</P>
<P>2. To find the Nature of Light we mu&s;t examine fir&s;t, what it is in the Lu|minous
Body that is the Fountain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bodies from whence Light proceeds.</NOTE> and emits or cau&s;es it; Secondly, what it is
in the Medium that propagates and conveys it; and Thirdly, what it is in the
Eye, or the &s;ubject that receives it, and is affected or acted by it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing then I &s;hall take notice of, is of the Bodies from which Light
proceeds, as from the Fountains; whence it has its Original and fir&s;t Spring&punc;
Namely, of &s;uch as we have no &s;en&s;e that informs us, that 'tis brought into
them from any other place, but &s;eems to be there generated and produced.</P>
<P>The&s;e Bodies are very many, and very differing in their Con&s;titutions,
and therefore the Enumeration of them, and &s;ome of their Proprieties may be a great
help to us to judge of the Nature of Light.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t and mo&s;t remarkable of all (at lea&s;t <HI>quoad nos</HI>) is the mo&s;t glo|rious
Body of the Sun; which from the glorious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The va&s;t Big|ne&s;s of the Sun and Di&s;tance from the Earth.</NOTE> great, and powerful Effects
of it upon this World or Earth, on which Mankind is placed, was by the Hea|thens,
<HI>Romans, Greeks, Per&s;ians,</HI> &amp;c. e&s;teemed a God, and &s;o wor&s;hipped
and adored; but under various Names, as <HI>Jupiter, Apollo, Phaebus, Phaeton,</HI>
and &s;everal other Names, all of which &s;ignified the Sun. As <HI>Juno, Venus, Cyn|thia,
Diana,</HI> &amp;c. &s;ignified the Moon. The things ob&s;ervable in this Body, be|&s;ides
its Light, are fir&s;t, that 'tis the greate&s;t Body we yet know in the World,
of who&s;e Magnitude we can have any tolerable Certainty: It being very much
bigger than all the Planets together, <HI>viz.</HI> &Saturn;, &Jupit;, &Mars;, the Earth, &Venus;, &Merc;, and their
Satellits, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e of &Saturn;, &Jupit;, and the Earth, and may be po&s;&s;ibly bigger than
any fixt Star, of which by and by.</P>
<P>The Bigne&s;s of it is collected from its Di&s;tance, and the Angle, under
which it is &s;een. The Di&s;tance is by &s;ome of our late A&s;tronomers, who have
been more than ordinarily curious in their Ob&s;ervations, judged to be about
10000 Diameters of the Earth di&s;tant from us, and the Angle under which it
is &s;een about half a Degree: Its Diameter therefore mu&s;t be about 1/114 part of
its Di&s;tance, and con&s;equently about 87 times bigger than the Diameter of the
Earth, its Body therefore being Spherical, as I &s;hall &s;hew by and by, mu&s;t be
87 times 87 times 87, that is, 658503 times bigger in Bulk than the Body or
Globe of the Earth: And therefore the Surface of it, which is the part that
gives Light, is 7569 greater than the whole Superficies of the Globe of the
Earth. Now almo&s;t half this Superficies is &s;een at once, and therefore that
part is near 3784&frac12; times bigger than the whole Superficies of the Earth. Now
every part of the whole Superficies of the Sun does &s;hine, and emit Light every
way <HI>in Orbem,</HI> which will be probable from this, that a very large Zone of
the Sun doth &s;o; and therefore &s;ince all parts of the Sun &s;eem to give Light
alike, it is more than probable, that every other part of the Sun's Surface doth
the &s;ame thing. Now before I demon&s;trate this, I mu&s;t note to you another
Propriety ob&s;erved in the Body of the Sun, which is nece&s;&s;ary for proving both
the real Bnlk of its Body, and the radiating every way of the Superficial parts
of it. It is ob&s;erved then, that there &s;ometimes happen to be &s;everal dark and
dusky Spots vi&s;ible upon its Surface, who&s;e Pa&s;&s;age over the Sun have been by
Tele&s;copes and other In&s;truments curiou&s;ly traced and calculated, by which it
plainly appears, 1&s;t, That this Body we &s;ee, which appears only as a Plain, is
a Globous and Spherical Body; and this becau&s;e the &s;aid Spots are ob&s;erved to
pa&s;s over its Face with a Motion proportion to a double Line of Sines, or as
they mu&s;t appear, &s;uppo&s;ing they were placed upon a Globe appearing under
that Angle, and equally turning round upon an <HI>Axis.</HI> This is yet further con|firmed
by the Alteration of the Shape of the Spots, when they are nearer the
<PB N="86" REF="120">
Limb, and &s;o are po&s;ited obliquely from what they appeared in the middle,
and &s;o directly faceing us; which Alteration perfectly an&s;wers to the Shape
of &s;uch a Spot, made upon the Face of a Globe, and by turning the Globe,
altering the Po&s;ition of it to the Eye. The&s;e tell us further, that this va&s;t
Globe makes a Revolution in 25 Days, or thereabouts, upon an Axis obliquely
po&s;ited to the Ecliptick; whence it is plain, as I noted before, that all parts of
the Sun's Surface do &s;hine, for that they are &s;ometime or other &s;een. 2dly,
There being no part of the Sun's Surface lying hetween the two Tropicks of
the Earth upon it, but is &s;ometime or other &s;een in all the Po&s;itions of a Hemi|&s;phere,
and yet continually &s;eeming as far as we can di&s;cover, equally giving
Light; it follows, that all tho&s;e parts at lea&s;t do emit Rays of Light <HI>in Orbem</HI>
the like may with all manner of Probability, be concluded of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The next thing then I &s;hall ob&s;erve is, that this great Body is &s;ubject to as
great Changes in its &s;uperficial parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sun &s;ubject to Changes and of the Spots &s;een in it.</NOTE> as any that happen to the $uperficial
parts of the Earth, and con&s;equently may have Generations and Corruptions,
or Alterations, as do happen here upon the Earth. This is eviden$$ by tho&s;e
great Spots which, as I have noted to you, do often appear upon the Face of the
Sun, and move along with it.</P>
<P>The&s;e are of no certain Figure, nor of any certain Bigne&s;s, but &s;ometimes
bigger, &s;ometimes le&s;s, &s;ometimes more appear, &s;ometimes fewer: &s;ometimes
darker, &s;ometimes dusky, &s;ometimes brighter. Mo&s;t of the dark have about
them a Duskine&s;s at a certain Di&s;tance, which does &s;ometimes remain after the
dark one be quite wa&s;ted, as they are found &s;ometimes before the dark appear.
Some of the&s;e Spots have been ob&s;erved to turn into Spots brighter than the re&s;t
of the Sun's Surface, but e&s;pecially when they approach the Limb of the Sun,
where al&s;o many of the dusky ones appear, and more than u&s;ually upon the
middle parts of the Sun. Both the dusky, and e&s;pecially the brighter parts,
are ob&s;erved to &s;tay &s;ome of them con&s;iderably longer in the Limb of the Sun
than they ought to do, according to the Theory of moving upon and along with
the <HI>Superficies</HI> of the Globe: But they are never &s;een to appear without the
Limb, but within the edge or in the very edge of the Sun, without making any
Protuberance. The brighter Spots are ob&s;erved to appear brighter towards the
Limb, and &s;ometimes to appear in it very bright.</P>
<P>They are ob&s;erved always to pa&s;s over the Face of the Sun, from the Ea&s;t|&s;ide
towards the We&s;t, &s;ometimes in a &s;traight Line, and &s;ometimes in an Ellip|&s;is
when they move regularly, but they are al&s;o &s;ometimes ob&s;erved to decline
out of tho&s;e Lines, and &s;werve &s;ometimes towards the North, and &s;ometimes
towards the South, but never to go the contrary way.</P>
<P>Sometimes one of the&s;e Spots divides into many, which &s;epareate from one
another, and &s;ometimes many of them coale&s;s, and joyn together in one.</P>
<P>From all which Appearances, it is very evident, Fir&s;t, That the&s;e Spots are
Bodies moved upon, or in &s;ome fluid Body &s;omewhat of the Nature of tho&s;e
we have upon the Earth, as to Fluidity, <HI>viz.</HI> Air or Water, though po&s;&s;ibly
the fluid, may differ from the&s;e Earthly Bodies in other Qualities.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the&s;e Bodies are either opaque, and &s;o hinder the Light of
the Sun to pa&s;s through them, or el&s;e they are incombu&s;tible and dark Bodies,
which will afford no Light at all for a certain time, and do as it were quench
and deaden that part of the Sun where they ri&s;e.</P>
<P>So that though the Face of the Sun be the mo&s;t glorious and vivid Light
that we are &s;en&s;ible of in the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Account of the Spots in the Sun.</NOTE> yet &s;ince the Di&s;covery and U&s;e of Per|&s;pective
Gla&s;&s;es it has been ob&s;erved, not to be free from &s;ome parts that are
dusky, and &s;ome perfectly dark, and &s;ome other parts that are ob&s;erved to give
a brighter Light than even the clear Face of the Sun it &s;elf: The former are
called <HI>Nebulae</HI> or Clouds, the &s;econd <HI>Maculae</HI> or Spots, and the third <HI>Faculae</HI> or
Blazes. The&s;e have been ob&s;erved by <HI>Schiner, Galileo,</HI> and others, to be gene|rated
up and down in various parts of the Sun's Face, and to increa&s;e and grow
bigger &s;ometimes, and &s;ometimes to grow le&s;s, decay and vani&s;h: Their In|crea&s;e
is &s;ometimes from a &s;mall Cloudine&s;s, to increa&s;e larger and larger, and
then in the middle &s;ometimes, and &s;ometimes in various parts of it, to have perfect dark Spots, which al&s;o continue to increa&s;e &s;ometimes &s;o big as to co|ver
<PB N="87" REF="121">
a part of the Sun equal to all <HI>Europe,</HI> and &s;ometimes to be bigger than all
the Superficies of the Earth, tho&s;e Spots do &s;ometimes coale&s;s and joyn all in|to
one, and &s;ometimes divide and &s;eparate into divers, and part a&s;under con&s;i|derably:
And again, at other times many of tho&s;e Spots which are generated
&s;eparately, do meet together and make one great one. The&s;e appear &s;ometimes
of a dusky Red, &s;ometimes Yellowi&s;h, &s;ometimes of a dusky Blew, and vari|ous
other Colours; their Shape is very irregular, and &s;carce any two alike, not
unlike the upper &s;ides or edges of the great white Clouds we u&s;ually &s;ee here
in the Summer-time: Yet generally the edges of the <HI>Maculae</HI> or darke&s;t Spots,
are very de&s;ined, and this Spot is perfectly Black to the very edges; but always
about the&s;e edges to a certain Di&s;tance, which is much the &s;ame, be the Spot
bigger or le&s;s there is a dusky bordering, which is likewi&s;e &s;haped according
to the edges of the Spot, and is all of an even Darkne&s;s or Duskine&s;s. The
<HI>Faculae</HI> are not defined but uneven, and u&s;ually appear brighte&s;t towards the
middle. The Shape of the&s;e Spots &s;ometimes continue much the &s;ame for &s;ome
Days, but yet &s;eldom without &s;ome Alteration: So that indeed they &s;eem to
be always in a State of Alteration, but &s;ometimes quicker &s;ometimes &s;lower.
From the Ob&s;ervation of them in &s;everal parts of the Sun, it is mo&s;t demon|&s;trably
evident, that they have &s;ome kind of Thickne&s;s, but very &s;mall in com|pari&s;on
to their Breadth; for as they approach towards the Limb, they keep
their extent toward the North and South, but diminish towards the Ea&s;t
and We&s;t, in the &s;ame manner as a broad flat Body would do if variou&s;ly po|&s;ited
to the Eye: In&s;omuch as &s;uch as are towards a round appear by degrees
to turn to a longer Oval, almo&s;t all in the edge appear a Line bended circular|ly,
which is an evident Proof that the Motion of them is on a Spherial Surface,
and not a plain, for if it were on a plain the Shape of them would receive no
other Alteration at the Limb of the Sun than it would at the middle. And
from hence al&s;o we have a good Argument, that the Body of the Sun is a Globe,
and not a plain flat round Superficies, as &s;ome of the ancient Philo&s;ophers are
&s;aid to have a&s;&s;erted it; nor a round Hole bored through the dark Shell of the
Univer&s;e, to let through the Light of the <HI>Caelum Empyreum,</HI> which &s;ome o|thers
of them are &s;aid to have a&s;&s;erted, &s;uppo&s;ing al&s;o the fixt Stars to be no|thing
el&s;e but &s;maller Holes through this dark Shell. But the&s;e Conceptions
as too rude, gro&s;s, and favouring of vulgar Conceptions, I pa&s;s over and pro|ceed
to ob&s;erve to you further, that the&s;e Spots of the Sun are ob&s;erved to
move generally all from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, and over the Face of the Sun, &s;ometimes
coming in at the Ea&s;t Limb, and in 12, 13, 14, or 15 Days to move to the We&s;t
Limb, and to perform this Motion regularly for the mo&s;t part, according to
an order of Sins, the Radius of the Sun being for the Radius, and the Order
beginning from the Center, which is another Demon&s;tration that their Motion
is on the <HI>Superficies</HI> of a Sphere, and that they move on it almo&s;t equal Spaces
in equal times, I &s;ay almo&s;t equal; becau&s;e they have a kind of Motion of
their own, whereby they are &s;ometimes as it were promoted and &s;ometimes
hindered, &s;ometimes carried a little towards the North, and &s;ometimes a little
towards the South. This Motion of theirs from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, over the Face
of the Sun, &s;ometimes appears to us to be made in a &s;traight Line, which hap|pens
when the Earth is in that part of the plain of the Ecliptick, which cuts the
Plain of the Equinoctial of the Sun's turbinated Motion, which is twice a Year,
<HI>viz.</HI> in the beginning of <HI>June</HI> and <HI>December:</HI> At other times the Line of the
Motion of them is incurvated and bent into an Ellip&s;e, which is greate&s;t when
the Earth happens to be in tho&s;e parts of the Ecliptick, which are the extream
Limits of it, compar'd to the Plain of the Sun's Equinoctial, which is al&s;o
twice a Year, <HI>viz.</HI> in the middle, between the Nodes, both Plains pa&s;&s;ing
through the Center of the Sun, that is, about the beginning of <HI>March</HI> and <HI>Sep|tember.</HI>
From whence al&s;o is deduced another undeniable Demon&s;tration, that
the Sun's <HI>Superficies</HI> is Globular, and that it moves round upon its <HI>Axis</HI> from
We&s;t to Ea&s;t, as the Earth and <HI>Jupiter</HI> al&s;o are proved to do. And another
Remark is likewi&s;e evidenced, that this <HI>Axis</HI> of the Sun's turbinated Motion,
remains fixt and directed toward the &s;ame parts of the Heavens. In the &s;ame
manner as the <HI>Axis</HI> of the Earth is ob&s;erved to do, and likewi&s;e the <HI>Axis</HI> of &Jupit;
and &Saturn;, &s;o far as we can yet di&s;cover by the Spots, Ring, and the Satellits of
<PB N="88" REF="122">
tho&s;e Bodies. So that the Method of Nature in mo&s;t things agrees both in our
and other Globous Bodies of the Univer&s;e. There is yet one Ob&s;ervation more
concerning the&s;e Spots, which further confirms this Deduction, and that is that
there is a certain torrid Zone, as I may call it from its Similitude to the torrid
Zone of the Earth, <HI>viz.</HI> a certain Space or Breadth on each &s;ide of the Aequa|tor
of the Sun towards the North and South Poles, in which the&s;e Clouds,
Smokes, Blazes, or Spots are ob&s;erved to appear mo&s;t: Whereas without tho&s;e
Limits, or in the two temperate Zones, they appear more &s;eldom, and tho&s;e
which do are only <HI>Nebulae</HI> or Clouds; but in the two Polar Zones there appear
none at all.</P>
<P>How great a Similitude there appears in this with the Globe of the Earth,
I need not now in&s;i&s;t on, only I &s;hall make this Remark by the by from this
Similitude, that though all that have hitherto &s;poken concerning this Subject,
have concluded that the time of the Revolution of the Sun's Body upon its
<HI>Axis,</HI> is to be deduced from the Revolution of &s;ome Spots that have la&s;ted
more than quite round the Body of the Sun, and come to the &s;ame Place again,
in which they were 29 Days before or thereabouts. I mu&s;t upon this occa&s;ion,
I &s;ay, remark that here upon the Earth, between and near the Tropicks, we
always have a continual Brieze of Air, which moves from Ea&s;t to We&s;t; which
upon very good Rea&s;on is concluded by <HI>Galileo,</HI> and mo&s;t of our Modern Natu|rali&s;ts,
to proceed from the Earths moving from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, and &s;o leaving
the Air behind, which lagging of the Air is yet much more con&s;iderably felt
and perceived in the higher Parts of it by the Clouds, and by the Pa&s;&s;age of
it over the tops of high Hills. So that if the&s;e Spots be Clouds or Smoke, or
&s;omewhat Analogous to them, rais'd into the Air, Atmo&s;phere, or &s;ome Fluid
Analogous to the Earth's Atmo&s;phere, as I &s;hall ob&s;erve by and by, then may
the Motion of the &s;olid Globe of the Sun be con&s;iderably &s;wifter than tho&s;e
Clouds appear to be carried, and in&s;tead of being 25 Days, po&s;&s;ibly may make
a Revolution in 20 Days or &s;ooner.</P>
<P>The&s;e Particulars I have here mentioned, I could have more largely de|mon&s;trated
to you by Schemes and Figures, whereby every Particular I have
a&s;&s;erted of this Matter might have been more fully &s;hewn and explained. But
I do rather avoid it; Fir&s;t, becau&s;e in Demon&s;trations of that kind very few
Auditors are able to go along with the De&s;cription and Quotations of Lines
and Letters in the Schemes; and Secondly, becau&s;e it &s;pends more time with
much le&s;s Advantage to the Auditory.</P>
<P>3. I &s;hall then in the next Place remark to you,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Suns Rays carry Heat as well as Light.</NOTE> That the Rays of the Sun
are ob&s;erved to carry with them Hear, or to produce it in the Bodies upon
which they fall, e&s;pecially if they be collected by the help of a reflecting or
a refracting Burning gla&s;s: In&s;omuch that by tho&s;e means it is ea&s;y to &s;et Bo|dies
into an actual Flame and Fire; nay, not only to &s;et Bodies on fire and con|&s;ume
them, but even to melt the mo&s;t &s;tubborn Bodies. In&s;omuch that none of
the Metals, as Tin, Lead, Silver, Bra&s;s, Copper, Iron, Gold, are able to in|dure
it without being in a Moment almo&s;t melted, and nor only the&s;e, but
Stones, Clay, Flints, Bricks, and almo&s;t all other Bodies that will not burn,
will by the Power of the Sun's Rays, collected with a Burning gla&s;s, be mel|ted
and turned into Gla&s;s to Admiration. Nay, 'tis po&s;&s;ible by this means to
augment the Heat to almo&s;t any a&s;&s;igned Degree, and po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome hundreds
times more than 'tis po&s;&s;ible to perform by all the Artificial Fires that can be
made with any combu&s;tible Materials we yet know: Of which Effects, and
the Cau&s;es and Proprieties thereof, more hereafter. Now after all this, there
have not been wanting divers Men who would needs per&s;wade us, that not|with&s;tanding
all the&s;e Ob&s;ervations the Body of the Sea has no Heat, nor have
the Rays them&s;elves, but that they produce Heat and Fire only by agitating
the $word$ upon which they fall, and are reflected; and this is the Rea&s;on (&s;ay
$span$ the upper Parts of the Air are &s;o very cold, and the under Parts
$word$ the Ground are &s;o very hot, for the Rays of the Sun, &s;ay they, being in
them&s;elves perfectly cold in pa&s;&s;ing thorough the upper Air; and being not re|flected&punc; they cau&s;e no Agitation or Heat, but being reflected from the Earth in the under Parts of the Air, the cro&s;s Agitation cau&s;eth the Parts of the Air to beat one
<PB N="89" REF="123">
again&s;t another, and this cau&s;eth Heat much in the &s;ame manner as a Flint and
Steel being &s;truck one again&s;t another, though neither of them be hot before
they meet together; yet when they meet, produce both Heat, Fire, and Light,
though there were no &s;en&s;ible Signs of any of the&s;e before, and &s;o a piece of
cold Iron may by being hammer'd on a cold Anvil with a cold Hammer, very
nimbly and &s;tongly, be not only heated &s;o as to burn ones Fingers, and to fire
Gunpowder, but to be vi&s;ibly red hot: So that though the Hammer and the
Anvil were both in them&s;elves devoid of Heat, yet their Motion does produce
it on the Iron. To this it may be an&s;wered, that as to the Warmth of the Air
at the bottom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the upper Air is colder.</NOTE> and the Coldne&s;s at the top of the Mountains, or high Towers,
the rea&s;on is plain from this, that the Air near the Earth is warmed by the
Heat of the Earth, and being not &s;o &s;wiftly moved and changed for cold Air,
as that which is at the tops of Mountains, or of very high Towers, which is
al&s;o further removed from the warm Surface of the Earth: But that the Rays of
the Sun will do the &s;ame thing as to burning of any Body by the help of a refract|ing
burning Gla&s;s at the top of a Hill or Tower, there is no manner of rea&s;on
to doubt. 'Tis, I think, &s;ufficiently evident to all the World, that Heat is con|vey'd
by the Sun Beams as well as Light, and that tho&s;e Beams both of Light
and Heat are emitted by the Sun, and therefore we have no more rea&s;on to be|lieve,
that the Sun has no Light than that it has no Heat.</P>
<P>4. All the&s;e Circum&s;tances con&s;ider'd, it &s;eems very rea&s;onable to conclude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the Sun has an Atmo|&s;phere, or &s;ome|thing like it.</NOTE>
that the Superficies of this great Body of the Sun is incompa&s;&s;ed with an Air or
Atmo&s;phere, or &s;ome other fluid Body or Men&s;truum, even as this Body of the
Earth; and that this Atmo&s;phere, though po&s;&s;ibly 80 times thicker than the
Thickne&s;s and Height of the Atmo&s;phere about the Earth, yet compared to the
Va&s;tne&s;s of the Diameter of the Body, it becomes wholly invi&s;ible to us, though
a&s;&s;i&s;ted with our be&s;t Tele&s;copes: And be&s;ides, 'tis not to be doubted, but that
being very near the Body, and having reflective Parts in it, it mu&s;t of it &s;elf
look as bright as the very Body it &s;elf, and con&s;equently that the Limb thereof
which appears to us is really the Shell of the Atmo&s;phere, Air, or fluid Men|&s;truum
about the Sun, and not the very &s;olid Body it &s;elf that &s;hines. Hence
all the Phaenomena of the <HI>Maculae</HI> and <HI>Faculae</HI> of the Sun ob&s;erved will be &s;ol|ved,
and the&s;e Spots of the Sun will be no other than our Clouds or Smokes,
which ri&s;e into the Atmo&s;phere; this I &s;ay, will plainly make out all their Ap|pearances
to be much the &s;ame as tho&s;e of Clouds are here with us. For 'tis not
to be doubted, but that we have &s;ometimes Clouds big enough to hinder the
Sun from &s;hining upon as great a part of the Earth's Surface, as tho&s;e Clouds
of the Sun do hinder us from &s;eeing of the Sun's Surface.</P>
<P>Hence 'twill be ea&s;y to know why they &s;ometimes move a little Northwards,
and &s;ometimes a little Southwards, but will follow the general Cour&s;e of the
Sun's Body, why the black Spots generally vary their Shape, regularly as on a
Spherical Surface, but that the bright ones do not, but &s;eem to grow otherwi&s;e;
why the bright ones appear mo&s;t near the Limb of the Sun, and not &s;o often in
the middle; namely, where we come to &s;ee the Light reflected from the under
&s;ides of the Spot, or Cloud: This gives a clear rea&s;on why they &s;tay &s;o long
about the Limb, and why they grow bigger, whereas the dark grow le&s;s and
&s;ooner vani&s;h. And in &s;hort, there is no Ob&s;ervation of the&s;e Spots in the Face
of the Sun that I have even yet made my &s;elf or &s;een of others, but will hereby
be clearly made out.</P>
<P>So that upon all that has been thus far &s;aid concerning the Body of the Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sun in mo&s;t pr$prietie$ a|gree$ with the Earth except that of Light.</NOTE>
it plainly appears, that it agrees with the Terraqueo-Aerial Globe in divers of
its Proprieties, and I &s;hall another time prove to you &s;everal other Particulars,
by which it will plainly appear, that they perfectly agree in mo&s;t other Pro|prieties
except Light, and wherein that difference con&s;i&s;ts I &s;hall likewi&s;e
&s;how.</P>
<P>I am the more particular (upon this occa&s;ion) in my De&s;cription of the Sun,
becau&s;e as it is the very Fountain of all vi&s;ible Light, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
Body in the World: So the Proprieties of this being explain'd, it will the more
clearly di&s;cover to us what are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Proprieties of Light in
<PB N="90" REF="124">
other Luminous Bodies, and thence we may be able fully to explain this Sub|ject,
which is the mo&s;t operative and mo&s;t con&s;iderable Ingredient of the Uni|ver&s;e.</P>
<P>5. Having thus &s;hewn you that it is nece&s;&s;ary there mu&s;t be a fluid Body in|compa&s;&s;ing
the &s;olid Body of the Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">There mu&s;t be a fluid Body en|compa&s;&s;ing a more &s;olid in the Sun, with more concerning the Spots.</NOTE> for otherwi&s;e tho&s;e irregular Motions of
the Spots cannot be made out, and with the &s;uppo&s;al of it, may be made
out and explained very rationally, I &s;hall now more particularly &s;hew you the
Rea&s;ons thereof. All that have hitherto made accurate Ob&s;ervations concern|ing
the&s;e Spots in the Sun, among&s;t which, I think, none has been more dili|gent
and curious than the Learned and Ingenious Je&s;uite <HI>Shinar,</HI> in his <HI>Ro&s;a Ur|&s;ina,</HI>
that the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the <HI>Maculae, Nebulae</HI> and <HI>Faculae,</HI> are much what
I have already given you an account of: And though there be one or two who
from &s;ome &s;uperficial and &s;light Ob&s;ervations, and from much of Fantcy have
pretended &s;ome other Motions of the&s;e Spots, and would thence conclude, that
they are not Clouds but &s;ome &s;maller Planets, &s;o near the Body of the Sun, as
that they can never be &s;een, b$$ when they are in their Perigean Conjunctions,
and &s;o come between the Sun and our Eye; yet &s;ince they are di&s;allowed of by
the mo&s;t diligent and curious Inquirers into the&s;e Matters, and &s;ince I could ne|ver
meet with any &s;uch my &s;elf, I have good rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pend my A&s;&s;ent to their
Conclu&s;ion, till by manife&s;t Ob&s;ervations it &s;hall $span$ to the contrary.
Certain it is, that the Bodies of <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Mencury</HI> when they have appeared
in the Face of the Sun, have been very differing in their form from tho&s;e of the
u&s;ual Spots: For Fir&s;t, they appear round, which few or none of the&s;e Spots
are ob&s;erved to do. Secondly, They have not been ob&s;erved to have any <HI>Ne|bulae</HI>
about them, which all the Spots that ever I have &s;een have always had.
And Thirdly, Their Motions have been &s;o &s;wift as to pa&s;s over the whole Face
of the Sun in a very &s;hort time, as in &s;ome few Hours; whereas the&s;e Spots
are at lea&s;t 12 days, and &s;ometimes longer. Fourthly, They are ob&s;erved to
pa&s;s over in a &s;traight Line, whereas the&s;e are very often ob&s;erved to pa&s;s in an
Ellip&s;e, <HI>quam proxime,</HI> and but twice a Year in a &s;traight Line. Fifthly, They
pa&s;s over the Sun with an equal &s;wiftne&s;s as to Sen&s;e whereas the&s;e pa&s;s with
very unequal, as I noted to you before, and according to the Proportions of
Sins. Sixthly, They make no &s;tay in the Limb, which the&s;e Spots oft-times
are ob&s;erved to do. It plainly follows therefore, that the&s;e Spots are very near
the Surface of the Sun, if not upon it.</P>
<P>I do not deny but that it is po&s;&s;ible there may be the Bodies of other Planets
about the Sun, nearer than that of &Merc;, which by rea&s;on of their nearne&s;s to its
Body, may never appear but only at &s;uch time as they happen to be ob&s;erved
whil&s;t they pa&s;s under the Sun: But I never yet met with any certain Ob&s;erva|tion
from which I &s;aw a nece&s;&s;ity for making &s;uch a Conclu&s;ion; for the Po&s;&s;i|bility
thereof is no ways a &s;ufficient Argument for its Nece&s;&s;ity, or &s;o much as a
Probability; for all the Ob&s;ervations that have been made of the&s;e Spots at the
Limb make their &s;tay rather longer than &s;horter than they ought to do, &s;uppo&s;ing
them upon the very Superficies of the Sun, and therefore they are &s;o far from
being without the &s;hining and bright Limb of the Sun, that 'tis manife&s;t that
they are within it, that is, within the Superficies of the Atmo&s;phere that incom|pa&s;&s;es
the Body of the Sun.</P>
<P>Now the &s;uppo&s;ing of &s;uch an Atmo&s;phere or fluid Body to incompa&s;s the
&s;olid Body of the Sun (for there is as great a nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;olid Body of the
Sun as there is of a fluid about it to make out the rea&s;on and cau&s;e of divers
other Proprieties of it, as I &s;hall afterwards &s;hew) will plainly and intelligi|bly
make out all the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Spots, and make it almo&s;t demon&s;trable
that the&s;e <HI>Maculae, Nebulae</HI> and <HI>Faculae</HI> of the Body of the Sun, are much of the
Nature of the Meteors rai&s;ed up into our Atmo&s;phere from the Earth, and, as
I &s;hall by and by make appear, will plainly &s;hew unto us from what cau&s;e the
Light of the Body proceeds. I have mentioned to you already, that the Spots
are $$&s;erved to &s;tay con&s;iderably longer in the Limb of the Sun than they ought,
according to the Rule of moving upon the Superficies of an opacous Globe,
for it has been found that they appear, when according to that Rule
they &s;hould di&s;appear; it follows therefore, that either they mu&s;t lo&s;e their
<PB N="91" REF="125">
Regularity when they come to the apparent Limb of the Sun <HI>quoad nos,</HI> or el&s;e
that the edge of the Limb is <HI>aliquatenus</HI> tran&s;parent; for the former there can
be no imaginary Rea&s;on, there being no difference in that part of the Superfi|cies
of the Sun from any other; becau&s;e every part of the Sun &s;ucce&s;&s;ively is in
the Limb, and Spots ari&s;e promi&s;cuou&s;ly in any Part of its middle Zone: It
mu&s;t therefore of nece&s;&s;ity be from the Tran&s;parency of &s;ome &s;mall Shell, about
the &s;olid &s;hining Body, and therefore probably of an Atmo&s;phere. But &s;econd|ly,
'Tis manife&s;t that this Atmo&s;phere is moved much as our Atmo&s;phere is;
for by many Ob&s;ervations it has been certainly found, that the&s;e Spots which
ri&s;e in the middle Zone of the Sun have been ob&s;erved to be longer in pa&s;&s;ing
over the Sun's Disk, than tho&s;e which happened in the Intermediate, which
perfectly agrees with the Motion of the Atmo&s;phere about the Earth, for the
Air between and near the Tropicks is ob&s;erved to lag and fall more behind the
Motion of the Earth than the Air in the temperate Zones; for in the Torrid
Zone the Air or Wind almo&s;t continually &s;eems to blow from the Ea&s;t, or
from &s;ome Point of it, which is generally now concluded to proceed from that
Cau&s;e, I &s;ay for the mo&s;t part from the Ea&s;t, or &s;ome Point of it, as Ea&s;t South-Ea&s;t,
or South-Ea&s;t, Ea&s;t-North-Ea&s;t or North-Ea&s;t, or the like, which ex|plains
al&s;o why tho&s;e Spots of the Sun are ob&s;erved to move &s;ometimes toward
the North-We&s;t, and &s;ometimes towards the South-We&s;t: But then tho&s;e in
the intermediate Zones follow the Cour&s;e of the Sun's Body more ea&s;ily, as
with us, where the Winds &s;ometimes blow from the We&s;twards, and &s;eem to
be moved fa&s;ter than the Earth it &s;elf.</P>
<P>6. Having therefore as far as the thing is capable of Demon&s;tration &s;hew'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the Sun is a &s;olid and opacous Body.</NOTE>
that the Superficies of the Sun is fluid and &s;omewhat transparent, and has
Motions in it analogous and very like to the Motions of our Atmo&s;phere:
I come in the next place to ob&s;erve to you, that the Body of the Sun it &s;elf with|in
this Shell is a &s;olid Body and opacous.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why &s;olid.</NOTE>
Its Solidity I prove from three Pro|prieties
here ob&s;ervable, and tho&s;e are Fir&s;t, the Con&s;tancy of its Rotation;
Secondly, The Fixtne&s;s of its Axis; And thirdly, the Power of its Gravitation
or Attraction to its Center. Fir&s;t, I &s;ay, from the Con&s;tancy of its Rotation,
this is an Argument &s;o plain, as nothing can be more, for we need go no further
than the Earth on which we tread, who&s;e Rotation we find very certain and
con&s;tant, and none can yet prove but that it is always equal and uniform; in
that Motion whereas we &s;ee the fluid Bodies about it, as the Air, nothing is
more uncertain and uncon&s;tant than them, nay though it be guided by the Su|perficies
of the Earth, nay the very Water which is contain'd in the Capacity of
the Earth, and &s;o has much more rea&s;on to move round, than if all fluid: Yet
we &s;ee that this has great Varieties of Currents, Ebbings and Flowings, and the
like; e&s;pecially in the great Ocean, though it be le&s;s in Seas inclo&s;ed, the &s;ame
we &s;hall find if we make tryal with Water in a Di&s;h, or Water about a Di&s;h, and
the like&punc; $hich will pre&s;ently confound a circular Motion that &s;hall be impre&s;s'd
upon i$, and &s;o mu&s;t quickly &s;tand &s;till, whereas we find it quite otherwi&s;e,
and to continue the &s;ame as it was fir&s;t ob&s;erved to do.</P>
<P>But then &s;econdly, by rea&s;on of the Fixedne&s;s of the Axis of its Revolution,
this is a &s;tronger Argument than the former for its Solidity; for there is no body
that we yet know that is fluid has any &s;uch Propriety as Magneti&s;m or Dire|ction,
and all that have a Magneti&s;m are &s;olid as the Earth, &Saturn;, &Jupit;, and the
Moon, the Magnet and Steel; nay, Steel being either melted or di&s;&s;olved in
<HI>Aqua Fortis,</HI> and &s;o made fluid, lo&s;eth its Virtue [And Iron heated red hot does
no more attract till cold, as having &s;omewhat of Fluidity] and if it would
lo&s;e the Regularity of its turbinated Motion, then certainly much rather
would it lo&s;e the Direction of its Axis, if it were not a Solid: It follows there|fore
that &s;ince 'tis evident from Ob&s;ervation, that this Axis keeps its Po&s;ition
and Directio$&punc; therefore that the Body of the Sun mu&s;t be a &s;olid and not a
fluid Body. The third Argument drawn from its attractive or gravitating
Power, to prove its Solidity, I cannot here &s;tay to in&s;i&s;t upon the Explication
of, becau&s;e the rea&s;on thereof cannot &s;o plainly appear without the Explica|tion
of a whole Theory of Gravity, which will come in $$re properly under
another Head, and therefore I can only tell you, that the Explication of the
<PB N="92" REF="126">
Cau&s;e of Gravity will clearly prove that the Body that has Gravitation &s;trictly &s;o
called, mu&s;t have al&s;o Solidity. Now that it has &s;uch an Attraction or Gravita|tion,
I &s;hall prove fir&s;t from its Spherical Figure; 2dly, From the Motion of the&s;e
Spots; and 3dly, From the Motions of all the other primary Planets, who&s;e
Motions as I have many Years &s;ince &s;hewed in this Place, are all influenced and
modulated by the attractive Power of this great Body. This al&s;o as the for|mer,
I mu&s;t for the pre&s;ent refer to that Head to be more fully explained and
demon&s;trated, and only name it at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>In the next place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why Opaque.</NOTE> that the Body within the Atmo&s;phere or tran&s;parent Shell,
is opacous, I argue from the di&s;appearing of the Spots in the Limb, and their
not returning backwards as they would &s;eem to do if the Body were tran&s;pa|rent
as the Atmo&s;phere is, or the Flame of a Candle, or the Radiations, or ha|zy
Light about the Nucleus of a Comet, through which as through its Beard.
I have &s;een &s;mall fixt Stars.</P>
<P>7. We find then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eight Particulars in which the Sun and Earth agree. Three wherein they differ.</NOTE> that thus far the Proprieties of the Body of the Sun do
&s;eem to agree with the Proprieties of the Body of the Earth: As fir&s;t, in its
Globular Figure: 2dly, In its Rotation; 3dly, In its Gravity; 4thly, In its
Polar Directions; 5thly, In its Atmo&s;phere; 6thly, In the Motions of that
Atmo&s;phere; 7thly, In attracting Planetary Bodies, 8thly, In the Fixtne&s;s of
its Axis or Polarity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But then in the next Place they differ, fir&s;t in Magnitude, the comparative
Quantities of each I &s;hew'd you before. 2dly, In the Make of the Surface,
that of the Earth being rugged and unequal, but that or the Sun as far as yet
can be di&s;covered, very equal and &s;mooth. 3dly, In their Qualities, the Sun's
Surface being both hot and light, and that of the Earth dark and cold; that
thererore which would afford the&s;e Proprieties to the Body of the Earth would
make the Earth on which we tread a Sun&punc; The&s;e two Proprieties then we find
Fire to &s;upply&punc; If therefore the Surface or the Earth were made and compound|ed
of Nitro$$ and Sulphureous Particles, or &s;uch like combu&s;tible Sub&s;tances,
and that they were once &s;et on fire, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why the Earth &s;hould not
be in all re&s;pects the &s;ame to the Moon as the Sun is to the Earth: Nor is
there any rea&s;on why all the other Proprieties of the Earth that it now hath,
excepting tho&s;e of Coldne&s;s and Opacity, &s;hould not remain much the &s;ame. If
therefore we further &s;uppo&s;e (I &s;ay &s;uppo&s;e for I $o not now intend in this Place
to prove that 'tis really and po&s;itively &s;o, and not otherwi&s;e, though I &s;hall af|terwards
from other Arguments demon&s;t$ably prove it) that the &s;olid Body of
the Sun is made or compounded of &s;uch Materials as will really work one upon
another, and di&s;&s;olve or burn each other, as we find Sulphur and Nitre do,
or any Sulphureous Body, and the Air when rightly joyned. From this Hypo|the&s;is,
I &s;ay, for I will not pre&s;ume to call it more at pre&s;ent, I conceive all
the Phaenomena of the Sun will be made very ea&s;ily intelligible, and be &s;hew'd
to be perfectly con&s;onant with the other Proce&s;&s;es of Nature, which is a very
probable Argument at lea&s;t that really it is even &s;o done and not other|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>1. Fir&s;t then I &s;ay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Phaenome|na of the Sun explained.</NOTE> &s;uppo&s;ing the Superficies of a Body as big as the Sun to
con&s;i&s;t of &s;uch Materials as would really work upon each other, and con&s;e|quently
burn, as violently as &s;ome Materials which are here upon the Earth
would do if once &s;et on Fire, I &s;ay the Surface of &s;uch a Body at &s;uch a Di&s;tance
&s;o burning, mu&s;t give to the Earth a very con&s;iderable Light and Heat.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t for Light, It is evident by Experiment that Nitre and Sulphur burning
each other, make a very bright Light; in&s;omuch, that few Eyes can indure to
look upon it, and is as intolerable almo&s;t as the Light of the Sun. Now 'tis ve|ry
probable, that the Materials that maintain the Fire of the Sun are yet much
more adapted for that purpo&s;e, and therefore that this Light and Heat may
much exceed it, but &s;till this doth not make the Action of it differ, nor make it
really differ in <HI>Specie</HI> from a Fire made with Earthy Materials but only in de|grees,
and therefore &s;till &s;uppo&s;ing the whole Superficies of the Sun to afford
as much Light in every vi&s;ible part of it, as the&s;e Bodies &s;o burning do, accor|ding
to the Bigne&s;s of their Surface; it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily very &s;trongly affect the
<PB N="93" REF="127">
Earth, though placed at this Di&s;tance; for all Light in the fir&s;t place propagates
<HI>in infinitum</HI> in an In&s;tant. Now the <HI>Medium</HI> between the Sun and us being
perfectly tran&s;parent, and &s;o nothing of the Light being lo&s;t but only rarify'd, it
follows, that we mu&s;t receive the &s;ame Proportion of the Light of &s;uch a Body
as we do now of the Light of the Body of the Sun as now it is: So that
thence the only Difference mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in the Proportion of the Light of the Bo|dies;
that is, whether the Light of any one part of the Sun equal to an Artifi|cial
Fire &s;o made, be any thing brighter: For if they be equal, as 'tis very
po&s;&s;ible they may, then the &s;ame Effects will follow. Now the Que&s;tion will
be, how &s;hall this be proved or tried, whether this be &s;o or not? We cannot go
to the Sun, nor fetch Fire from Heaven, as <HI>Prometheus</HI> is &s;aid to have done: Nor
can we &s;et or remove our Fire &s;o far di&s;tant from us, as to make an equal Com|pari&s;on
of the one with the other. I grant it, we cannot; but yet Art may
help us to a way, by which we may be able to a&s;cend thither by Rea&s;on, and
be as much a&s;&s;ured of it as if we actually did it: And that is, by knowing in
what Proportion the Quantity of Light does dimini&s;h, according to the di&s;tance
it is propagated from the Luminous Body; for by that means, we may mea|&s;ure
<HI>Hercules</HI> by his Foot, from exact Ob&s;ervations made of the Power of Lu|minous
Bodies in propagating Light here with us, we may calculate the Power
of Luminous Bodies, though never &s;o far di&s;tant. Light then, as I formerly
hinted, doth decrea&s;e in Duplicate Proportion to its di&s;tance of Propagation
from the Luminous Body, that is in the &s;ame Proportion with the Superficies
of the Spheres of Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>For &s;uppo&s;e A the Luminous Point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Proportion of the Diminu|tion of Light. <HI>Fig. 4. Plate</HI> 1.</NOTE> that emits a Quantity of Light to fill the
Space ABB; this Light in the next Space fills BBcc, then ccdd, then
ddEE: And at EE it is arrived at twice the Di&s;tance of BB from A. The
Power therefore of this Ray of Light which at BB was all contained within
the circular Ba&s;e of the Cone ABB, is by that it acts at the Di&s;tance EE ex|panded
into the circular Ba&s;e of the Cone AEE; Namely, into the Circle
EE, which Circle being twice the Bigne&s;s of BB in Diameter, mu&s;t have its
Area Quadruple to the Area of BB. And &s;o of FF, which is at treble the
Di&s;tance, the Area of the circular Ba&s;e of the Cone AFF will be Nine times
the Area of BB, and &s;o onward the Areas increa&s;e in a Duplicate Proportion
of the Di&s;tance of them, from the Apex of the Cone, or which is the &s;ame
from the Luminous Point A.</P>
<P>The Power therefore of Light thus propagated will be dimini&s;hed or rari|fied,
&s;o that at twice the Di&s;tance it will have but a Quarter of the Power at
thrice the Di&s;tance, but one Ninth at Four times the Di&s;tance, but 1/26 at five
times the Di&s;tance, but 1/25 part of the Power which it had at one Space of
Di&s;tance: And con&s;equently the Proportion of the Power of Light at any one
Di&s;tance, to the Power of the Light at any other Di&s;tance, will be reciprocally
Duplicate to the re&s;pective Di&s;tances, as the Power of Light at five Spaces Di|&s;tance
to that at fix Spaces Di&s;tance, will be as 1/25 to 1/36, that is as 36 to 25;
for as 1/25, 1/36:: 36. 25. which are the Squares of the Di&s;tances reciprocally
taken. This, I &s;ay, is the Expansion of Light according to the various Di|&s;tances
of its Action from the Luminous Body, and according to this Rule all
Light is found to act and dimini&s;h its Power in Proportion to its greater Di|&s;tance.
So that the Power of any Artificial Light, as Fire, Flame, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being
found at any mea&s;urable Di&s;tance, the Power of it may be ea&s;ily found for
any a&s;&s;ignable Di&s;tance be it never &s;o great: And on the contrary, the Power
of Natural Light, as that of the Sun, Moon, Planet, or Stars, being found
by Experiment at an a&s;&s;igned Di&s;tance, though never &s;o great, the Power of
it may be found by Calculation at any a&s;&s;igned Di&s;tance, though never &s;o near,
and con&s;equently we have a means of truly calculating the comparative Power
of Natural and Artificial Lights from Experiments made on each of them.
But then &s;econdly, We have another thing to be taken notice of in our Calcu|lation,
to make the Compari&s;on compleat and exact, and that is of the Area
of the Luminous Body, for 'tis not enough to calculate the Power of one
<PB N="94" REF="128">
Point only, but the Power of an Aggregate of them mu&s;t al&s;o be taken notice
of. And this is of the Cone inverted, and turned the other way, where the
Apex of the Cone is the Eye, or the Point of the Subject inlightned, and
the Ba&s;e is in the Luminous Body, as the Disk of the Sun, and this by &s;uppo|&s;ing
the Ray in all Degrees of Di&s;tance equally &s;trong, does dimini&s;h the
Power of inlightning in Proportion to the vi&s;ible Angle, under which it ap|pears
at greater or greater Di&s;tances. This therefore will al&s;o be in Dupli|cate
Proportion to the Di&s;tance reciprocally taken; for the Area of Light
mu&s;t &s;ubtend equal Angles or Cones to make an equal Light, and therefore
at double Di&s;tance there mu&s;t be Four times the Area of Light to make the
&s;ame Effect, and at treble Di&s;tance Nine times the Light, and at Quadruple
Di&s;tance Sixteen times the Luminous Area to produce the &s;ame Effect upon
the Subject. A circular Area therefore of as bright a Light, or &s;hining Body
as the Sun, being placed at &s;uch a Di&s;tance as that it may appear under
much &s;ame Conical Angle as the Sun doth, <HI>viz.</HI> of $/2 a Degree, mu&s;t give as
Light to the Subject as the Sun it &s;elf.</P>
<P>From the&s;e two Con&s;iderations, 'twill be ea&s;y to calculate the comparative
Power of naturally Luminous Bodies to the Power of &s;uch as are artificially,
or to compare the Light of the Sun with the Light of Coles, Flame, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
to &s;ee their Differences.</P>
<P>From which I que&s;tion not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Light from the Sun caused by an actual Fire.</NOTE> but that there may be very cogent Arguments
drawn to prove, that the Light of this Body of the Sun may be cau&s;ed by an
actual Fire, or Di&s;&s;olution of the &s;uperficial Parts thereof; partly by the At|mo&s;phere
or Air incompa&s;&s;ing it, and partly al&s;o by the Con&s;tituents of it mix|ed
together into one Ma&s;s, which have Analogy with our Sulphur and Nitre,
which do work upon and burn each other, and &s;o the Sun will be found to
be a va&s;t Globular Body, who&s;e whole Superficies is in a continual Di&s;&s;olu|tion
or Fire; partly by the working of its con&s;tituent Parts one upon another,
and partly al&s;o by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Atmo&s;phere, Air, or Fluid Body, in|compa&s;&s;ing
it. And thence we may deduce, that the Phy&s;ical or Natural
Cau&s;e of its Light, is the actual Fire or burning of its &s;uperficial Parts;
which being proved, or &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o, all the Appearances that have been hi|therto
taken notice of concerning Clouds, Spots, and Blazes, will be very na|turally
and clearly &s;olved; and there is no one Ob&s;ervation I have yet made,
or met with in other Authors, that do any way &s;eem to cro&s;s or thwart it.
Matters of Fact none can deny, that &s;uch Changes and Alterations do happen,
and I conceive it will be as ea&s;ily granted, that they have their Natural Cau|&s;es.
And therefore that which doth with mo&s;t likelihood &s;olve them, is at
lea&s;t the mo&s;t probable Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But &s;ome may object and &s;ay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Objection an&s;wered.</NOTE> that if this were &s;o, certainly the Body of
the Sun in &s;o many Thou&s;and Years would have been all con&s;umed, at lea&s;t
would have grown &s;en&s;ibly le&s;s. Suppo&s;e this were granted and &s;aid, that it
has grown &s;ome Minutes le&s;s &s;ince it fir&s;t began to give Light, none could con|tradict
it by any Ob&s;ervations we have upon Record; for we have no A&s;tro|nomical
Ob&s;ervations of that kind 2000 Years at lea&s;t, that could evidence
the contrary. But &s;uppo&s;ing we had Ob&s;ervations of 4000 Years &s;tanding,
and that they had found the Diameter of the Sun to be as many Minutes as
'tis now, yet that would have been no Argument but that the Sun might have
every Year been a Mile le&s;s in Diameter than it was the preceding Year, and
con&s;equently been 4000 Miles le&s;s in Diameter than it was 4000 Years ago.
No Ob&s;ervation never &s;o carefully made, either then or now, could have
contradricted it: For if the Sun's Diameter be near 87 times bigger than the
Diameter of the Earth, and the Earths Diameter be near 8000 Miles, the Dia+meter
of the Sun mu&s;t be near 696000 Miles, and 4000 is but a 174 part
of the Diameter, and con&s;equently could have dimini&s;ht it but about $ of a
Minute, which is a much le&s;s Quantity than the An$ients pretended to ob|&s;erve to.
But &s;uppo&s;ing they could have ob&s;erved even to Seconds, yet that
<PB N="95" REF="129">
could not have contradicted it, &s;ince as I &s;hall upon occa&s;ion &s;hew a Rea&s;on,
why the Sun may have approacht as much as to recompence that Defect.
But I have not now time to explain it: And &s;hall only add, that this being
&s;o, it will thence very rationally follow, that the Stars al&s;o being very pro|bably
Bodies in mo&s;t Proprieties the &s;ame with the Sun, will be Bodies al&s;o
who&s;e Superficies do actually burn con&s;onant to which the Ob&s;ervation of
the Noble <HI>Tycho,</HI> and others of the Stars that appear'd in <HI>Ca&s;&s;iopeia,</HI> in the
Year 1572 will be judged to be all fir'd together, and &s;o quite burnt out in
one Year; for it la&s;ted no longer, and did never appear before, nor has &s;ince
that I can hear of. Con&s;onant to this Theory, will be the Appearances of
Comets, of which kind I this Week ob&s;erved one in the Sign of <HI>Scorpio.</HI>
But of this Matter I have el&s;ewhere di&s;cour&s;ed &s;omewhat already, and &s;hall
add more hereafter upon another Opportunity, when I come to explain
what the Cau&s;e of Light is in Fire, and other Luminous Bodies here below
within our reach; the Explanation of which will manife&s;tly demon&s;trate to us
what 'tis in all other Bodies what&s;oever that are out of our Reach.</P>

<HEAD>The CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<Q>1. Light the mo&s;t admirable Effect of Nature, one of the principal Pow|ers
by which every part of the great Exi&s;tence of Material Beings is
united and made one. The Infinitene&s;s or Indefinitene&s;s of the active
Power of Light already explained; the &s;maller the Stars appear, the
greater is their Di&s;tance; the rea&s;on why &s;ome before invi&s;ible are made
vi&s;ible by Tele&s;copes, becau&s;e few Eyes can be affected by any Object
under a le&s;s Angle than a Minute; thence &s;everal &s;mall Stars coale&s;ce
into one, and why &s;ome of the fixt Stars, though le&s;s than a Minute,
as but of a &s;econd, are yet vi&s;ible; an Objection again&s;t the u&s;e of Te|le&s;copes
in Astronomical Ob&s;ervations an&s;wered, and why the Stars ap|pear
le&s;s through a Tele&s;cope than to the naked Eye. 2. An Explica|tion
aad Confirmation of <HI>Des Cartes</HI> Hypothe&s;is of Vi&s;ion, and that
the fixt Stars are really at different Di&s;tances, though they may be al&s;o
of different Magnitudes, a farther Rea&s;on that the Propagation of Light
mu&s;t be in&s;tantaneous. 3. The innate Light of all Cele&s;tial Luminous
Bodies proceeds from an actual and real Fire &s;omething like that on
the Earth, though not altogether the &s;ame, the Fuel being po&s;&s;ibly dif|ferent.
4. By this the Subject of the Inquiry is brought nearer, viz.
on combu&s;tible Sub&s;tances, whereon we may exerci&s;e our Scrutinies with
more Power, to find the Cau&s;e of Light and Fire, and by Analogy,
what it is in the Sun: Which therefore is to be the Subject of future
Di&s;cour&s;es. 5. Of the Nature of Comets, which are another &s;ort of
Cele&s;tial Fire, which ought to be examined before the treating of Ter|re&s;trial
and Culinary Fires, and who&s;e Light is different from that of the
Sun, Stars or Planets, their different Appearances have cau&s;ed great dif|ference
in Writers of them. The three Opinions mention'd by <HI>Seneca</HI>
in his Natural Que&s;tions enumerated, with tho&s;e of other Ancient and
Modern Philo&s;ophers.</Q>
<P>1. I Began the la&s;t Term to explain to you &s;everal of the Proprieties of Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Light the mo&s;t admirable Effect in Na|ture.</NOTE>
as being one of the mo&s;t admirable Effects of Nature which are &s;ubjected
to our Sen&s;es, and con&s;equently to our Speculation and Contemplation, as be|ing
one of the fir&s;t and principal of the Powers of the great Sy&s;tem of the
World, by which the whole is united and made one; and every one part of that
unconceivably great Exi&s;tence of Material Beings is affected by every other,
which may thence not improperly be called one Body, or the only Material or
Corporeal Being, di&s;tinct from which no other Corporeal being is.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="131">
This by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> in the Hi&s;tory of the Creation, is comprehended under the
double Name of Heaven and Earth, denoting both, one material Being; but
con&s;idered in its parts, Namely, fluid and &s;olid Matter. After the Creation of
which God &s;aid, Let there be Light and there was Light, &s;o that the fir&s;t a|ctive
Power was Light.</P>
<P>Some of the Proprieties of this active Power I have already explained:
Namely, fir&s;t its indefinite Exten&s;ion to every part of the whole of Matter,
which becau&s;e our Imagination can &s;et no Bounds or Limits to; I therefore call
infinite or indefinite, not as &s;uppo&s;ing it to be really &s;o, but for that, as our
Sen&s;es inform us of no &s;uch Bound, &s;o neither can our Imagination fix the <HI>ne plus
ultra,</HI> beyond which no Material Being can exi&s;t. For wherever we put it, we
pre&s;ently &s;uppo&s;e Space and Exten&s;ion beyond it, and that at lea&s;t if it be not
Body, as <HI>Des Cartes</HI> would have it; yet it has the in&s;eparable Propriety of Bo|dy
and Matter, namely, Exten&s;ion: And no one has yet told us, what Body is
di&s;tinct from Exten&s;ion, or what is the true E&s;&s;ence of Body or Material Being,
be&s;ides Exten&s;ion; and 'tis as ea&s;y to conceive indefinite Body, as indefinite
Exten&s;ion. Nor indeed can Exten&s;ion be well conceived without the Notion
of Body, no more than Body can without the Notion of Exten&s;ion:
for Exten&s;ion is nothing but the ab&s;tracted Notion of &s;omewhat extended:
And therefore if there be Exten&s;ion, there mu&s;t be &s;omewhat extended.
Now if it be not the Propriety of Spirits, as all Divines and Philo&s;ophers con|clude,
but only of Body, then wherever there is Exten&s;ion, there is really a Bo|dy
extended; and therefore &s;ince our Imagination can never limit Exten&s;ion, &s;o
neither can they &s;et Bounds to Matter or Material Being.</P>
<P>Now I told you, that our Eyes a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the help of Gla&s;&s;es inform us that
Light is propagated or communicated to us from utmo&s;t inconceivable Di&s;tan|ces,
at lea&s;t if we believe the va&s;t Di&s;tances the Stars are placed from us, and
that the &s;maller the Stars are the greater is their Di&s;tance: For &s;till the lon|ger
and better our Tele&s;copes are the more are there di&s;covered of &s;mall Stars
which were before, and without that Help invi&s;ible; not for that they did not
affect the Eye with Light without, as well as with the help of the Tele&s;cope,
but becau&s;e the Power of the Eye is limited to a certain Magnitude of Appear|ance,
under which nothing can be di&s;tinctly perceived: What&s;oever Object
therefore affects the Eye under a le&s;s Angle than that Eye can di&s;tingui&s;h, be|comes
invi&s;ible or not &s;een. Now whereas mo&s;t Eyes di&s;tingui&s;h not a le&s;s
Angle than a Minute, or the 60th part of a Degree, or the 21600 part of a
Circle, therefore whatever is &s;en&s;ated or &s;een by it, is &s;een of that Bigne&s;s or
under that Angle: And &s;o if there be 2 or 3, or 10 or 100 &s;mall Stars &s;o near
together as that they are all compri&s;ed within the Angle of one Minute, the
Eye has a Sen&s;ation of them all, as if they were one Star, and di&s;tingui&s;hes
them not one from another; &s;o likewi&s;e is it, that if the Light be &s;trong and
powerful &s;o as to affect the Eye, it always appears of the Bigne&s;s of a Minute,
though po&s;&s;ibly its real Angle be not a &s;econd. Thence every Star that &s;uch an
Eye di&s;covers, appears to be of the Bigne&s;s of a Minute at lea&s;t, and &s;o it is
conceived really to be, though yet when we come to examine its Diameter by
the help of Tele&s;copes, we really find it to be but &s;ome few &s;econds or &s;ixti|eth
Parts of &s;uch an Angle; and hence it is, that it is told as a very great
Wonder, and is indeed as a great Argument objected again&s;t the U&s;e of Tele|&s;copes,
that there can be no Truth in the Di&s;coveries made by them: For that
though they are found to magnify and increa&s;e the Appearance of all other Ob|jects
except the Stars; yet when they are viewed through them they appear
to be rather le&s;&s;ened than increa&s;ed in Bulk, whence they conclude of that
In&s;trument that does &s;ometimes magnify and &s;ometimes not, and indeed both
at the &s;ame time (as when one looks on two Stars 10 Minutes di&s;tant from each
other, their Di&s;tance is really augmented though their apparent Diameters &s;eem
not to be at all) they conclude, I &s;ay, that all the Appearances through &s;uch
an In&s;trument are uncertain and imperfect, and real Mi&s;informations, and con|&s;equently
nothing but Phantomes and fal&s;e Repre&s;entations; and this Con&s;ide|ration
or indeed Incon&s;ideration hath been the occa&s;ion why &s;everal otherwi&s;e
very ingenious and knowing Men have been prejudiced again&s;t the making u&s;e
of Tele&s;copes, and other Optick Gla&s;&s;es, for the Di&s;covery of Nature, for not
<PB N="98" REF="132">
knowing how to an&s;wer to them&s;elves the&s;e and &s;ome &s;uch other Objections
as ea&s;ily an&s;werable, if well con&s;idered, they have fallen into a Disbelief of
the whole Information the&s;e Helps afford us; and will therefore in all Ob&s;er|vations
on which they build any thing; only make u&s;e of the naked Eye:
Whereas had they made u&s;e of the&s;e Helps, they would have been able to have
made much greater Advances in their Discoveries and Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>To an&s;wer this Objection therefore again&s;t the Truth of the Di&s;coveries of
Tele&s;copes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Objection again&s;t the u&s;e of Tele&s;copes an&s;wered.</NOTE> and tho&s;e of Micro&s;copes, I &s;ay; that the&s;e In&s;truments do equally
magnify the real Angle, under which any Object appears to the naked Eye,
and &s;o doe equally magnify the real Angle of the Stars, as well as of any
other Object, and that the Fallacy lies in the Eye and not in the In&s;trument:
For as I &s;aid, &s;uch is the make of the &s;en&s;ible part of the Eye, <HI>viz.</HI> of the <HI>Tu|nica
Retina,</HI> that it cannot di&s;tingui&s;h in mo&s;t Eyes an Angle le&s;s than a Mi|nute
(though there be &s;ome that can to the third of a Minute, but the&s;e are
very few) whence if there be any &s;trong &s;hining Object that does very power|fully
operate on the Eye, &s;o as to create a Sen&s;ation, and yet does really act
under an Angle only of &s;ome few &s;econds; yet becau&s;e the Eye cannot di&s;tin|gui&s;h
a le&s;s Angle than a Minute, the Object is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a Minute in Big|ne&s;s:
And &s;o if the Tele&s;cope do not &s;o far increa&s;e the real Diameter of the
Object as to make it more than a Minute, it does &s;eem indeed not at all to
magnify it; becau&s;e it is &s;till made to appear, but under the Angle of a Mi|nute.
<HI>Des Cartes</HI> has a very ingenious Explication of the <HI>Tunica Retina,</HI> or the
way of Vi&s;ion, which does very intelligibly make out the rea&s;on of this Pro|priety
in the Eye: Which po&s;&s;ibly it may not be ami&s;s now a little to explain,
that &s;ome Prejudices may be removed, again&s;t Arguments that are deduced
from Ob&s;ervations made with Tele&s;copes, and &s;ome other Optical Gla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>2. &startq;He explains then (as <HI>Porta, Kepler, Shinar, Galileo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Des Caries Hypothe&s;is of Vi&s;ion.</NOTE> and many others
that had treated of that Subject before him do) the Organ of Vi&s;ion the
Eye, by the Similitude of it to a dark Room, into which no other Light is
admitted but what enters by one round Hole, in which a convenient Con|vex
refracting <HI>Lens</HI> is placed &s;o, as to collect all the Rays from Objects
without, and to unite them in their di&s;tinct and proper places upon a Wall
or Sheet of Paper at a covenient Di&s;tance within; whereby the Picture of
all tho&s;e Objects that are without the Room, is made as it were and placed
upon the Wall or Sheet within: This Sheet &s;ays he in the Eye, is the <HI>Tunica
Retina,</HI> on which the Picture of all Objects without the Eye are as it were
painted and de&s;cribed. Now this Picture on the <HI>Tunica Retina</HI> is nothing
but the Impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;everal Rays from the Objects without, collected
by the help of the <HI>Cornea</HI> and <HI>Cry&s;talline,</HI> as by the Convex Gla&s;s in the dark
Room. And the <HI>Retina</HI> being like a piece of Plu&s;h, with the ends of the
Threads turn'd towards the <HI>Cry&s;talline,</HI> all the other ends of them being termi|nated
in the <HI>Brain,</HI> there can be no more di&s;tinct Sen&s;ations than there are
di&s;tinct Threads to convey the Impre&s;&s;ion on them: So that if the whole Pi|cture
of the Object be &s;maller than one &s;ingle Thread of this Plu&s;h, it can|not
affect or move a le&s;s part than one of tho&s;e &s;mall Threads or Filaments
of the <HI>Retina,</HI> and therefore the Sen&s;ation is the &s;ame as if the Object did
take up or cover the whole end of the Thread or Filament, though it affect
but a tenth part of it provided it be &s;trong.&endq;</P>
<P>I have been the more particular in the Explication of this, becau&s;e &s;ince my
former explaining of the indefinite exten&s;ive Power of Light, I have met with
&s;ome that have objected again&s;t the Reality of the Appearances through Tele|&s;copes,
as if no Arguments drawn from Ob&s;ervation, made by the Help of &s;uch
were to be e&s;teemed of any force, whereas indeed all &s;uch Objections do only
proceed from an Ignorance of the Grounds of Opticks and of Vi&s;ion, we being
equally as certain of the Appearances we di&s;cover by them, as of tho&s;e things
which are di&s;covered and &s;een by the naked Eye. It was by &s;ome of the An|cients
conjectur'd, that the <HI>Galaxia</HI> or Milky Way was nothing el&s;e but a great
number of Stars, &s;o &s;mall as that they could not be di&s;tingui&s;h'd: Tele&s;copes
have di&s;covered the Truth of that Conjecture, and manife&s;ted it to be &s;o, and
<PB N="99" REF="133">
we have henceforth no more rea&s;on to doubt that it is &s;o, than we have to
doubt whether there are any Stars at all in the Heavens.</P>
<P>Others again I find to object,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the fixt Stars are at different Di|&s;tances.</NOTE> that though there really be &s;uch a great Variety
of Magnitudes in the Appearances of the fixt Stars, yet it is uncertain whether
tho&s;e Magnitudes do wholly proceed from the Di&s;tances of them, and not ra|ther
from a real Difference in their Magnitudes, and if &s;o, then all tho&s;e Stars
both great and &s;mall may be at equal or very near equal Di&s;tances from the
Earth; and if &s;o, then the Exten&s;ions of the Heavens need not be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o
va&s;tly big, as if their appearing Magnitudes proceeded only from their Remote|ne&s;s
from the Earth: To which I &s;ay as I did before explain, that I do &s;up|po&s;e
their appearing Magnitude to be cau&s;ed by both; that is, Eir&s;t by their
real Difference in Magnitude and in Brightne&s;s; and &s;econdly, by their differ|ing
Di&s;tance from us. The Vi&s;iblene&s;s of &s;ome proceeds from their extraordina|ry
Vividne&s;s of Light, as that of the Great Dog-&s;tar, which though it be the
mo&s;t con&s;picuous Star in the Heavens, is yet found by the Tele&s;copes ro be
le&s;s in Diameter than &s;everal others which appear not &s;o confpicuous: As that
of the Bull's Eye.</P>
<P>And this by the way &s;eems to be the rea&s;on of the Appearance of the New
Star in <HI>Ca&s;&s;iopea,</HI> ob&s;erved by <HI>Ticho Brahc,</HI> and by divers other eminent A&s;tro|nomers
of that time, which from a Star of the third Magnitude increa&s;ed to
be of the Bigne&s;s of <HI>Venus,</HI> and more con&s;picuous than any other fixt Star in
the Heaven, and yet in le&s;s than a Year it dimini&s;hed by degrees and went out
wholly, and hath not &s;ince appeared; all which time of its Appearance it per|fectly
kept the &s;ame place without any Variation, &s;o that in Probability it was
a fixt Star before of a very dull Light, and &s;o invi&s;ible till by &s;ome Con&s;titu|tion
in its make, as &s;ome more combu&s;tible Shell or Orb of its Body, it then
burnt or &s;hined out more con&s;picuou&s;ly, which Shell being once con&s;umed, it
again di&s;appeared, and has &s;ince that time been no more &s;een.</P>
<P>Others again, that to the naked Eye appear one Star, and that very con&s;pi|cuous,
by the Tele&s;cope are di&s;cover'd to be two or more Stars, &s;o near toge|ther
as that the Eye cannot di&s;tingui&s;h between them, both the Images of them
falling upon one &s;ingle Filament of the <HI>Tunica Retina,</HI> and &s;o both of them
making but one Impre&s;&s;ion on the Brain; of this kind the mo&s;t remarkable is
the Star in the Left Horn of <HI>Aries,</HI> which whil&s;t I was ob&s;erving the Comet
which appeared in the Year 1664. and followed till he pa&s;t by this Star, I took
notice that it con&s;i&s;ted of two &s;mall Stars very near together: A like In&s;tance
to which I have not el&s;e met with in all the Heaven, they &s;eeming to be both
of rhem very near of equal Bigne&s;s, and yet &s;o very near together, that you
will need a Tele&s;cope of a con&s;iderable Length to &s;ee them both di&s;tinct and
&s;eparate.</P>
<P>Others, I conceive, may be of equal Di&s;tance, and may yet appear of diffe|ring
Magnitudes from their real Difference of Magnitude, the Body of the one
being &s;o much bigger than the other as they appear.</P>
<P>But after all this, I conceive it very probable, that the greate&s;t Number of
the &s;mall Stars appear &s;uch, not from any of the&s;e fore-mentioned Rea&s;ons, but
only becau&s;e they are further di&s;tant from us: It may be objected perhaps,
that 'twill be very hard to prove, whether that be the Cau&s;e or not of &s;uch
their Appearance: But to this 1 an&s;wer, that though it hath not yet been po&s;i|tively
proved, yet as I mentioned in my Attempt to prove the Motion of the
Earth by Ob&s;ervations, I there hinted &s;omewhat to this purpo&s;e, and it &s;hall
not be long before I acquaint the World with what I have done in that kind.
So that for the pre&s;ent I &s;hall &s;ay, that upon the whole there is no rea&s;on to
doubt, but that the extent of the Heavens is va&s;tly beyond what we have hi|therto
imagined, and con&s;equently that the extent of the Propagation of Light
is equal with it, and therefore, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Objections that I former|ly
laid down, remains without any &s;olid Rea&s;on again&s;t it.</P>
<P>I proceeded next to &s;hew that this Propagation of Light was to all imagina|ble
Di&s;tance in a Moment or In&s;tant of Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the in&s;tantaneous Mo|tion of Light.</NOTE> in&s;omuch that every one part of
the Univer&s;e might by this means be affected by every other part of it, and though
I then related &s;ome con&s;iderable Objections again&s;t it, and to prove its Propa|gation
Temporaneous, that is to &s;pend &s;ome con&s;iderable time in pa&s;&s;ing from
<PB N="100" REF="134">
the Lucid to the enlightned Body, if at a great Di&s;tance, yet as I &s;hall after|wards
prove by the Effects of Light, the Propagation mu&s;t be in&s;tantaneous.</P>
<P>After this I explained what Light was in the Lucid Body: And for that
end more particularly de&s;cribed the Con&s;titution and Make of the Body of the
Sun, as the principal and mo&s;t considerable Body for Light as to us, and &s;hewed
many Arguments to prove, that it is no other than a Body actually burning or
on Fire, that it has an Atmo&s;phere that incompa&s;&s;es it, which may po&s;&s;ibly be
the <HI>Men&s;truum</HI> that di&s;&s;olves it, as the Air or Atmo&s;phere about the Earth is
the <HI>Men&s;truum</HI> of burning Bodies here upon the Earth, that it did &s;ometime
produce dark Spots or Clouds, which &s;eem'd Analogous to our Smoke, and
&s;ometimes brighter, which &s;eem'd Analogous to our Flames. So that upon the
whole, I concluded it a &s;olid Globous Body actually on fire in its &s;uperficial
Parts, and that from that Fire its Light and Heat proceeded.</P>
<P>The Light of the Moon and other Planets, both Secundary and Primary,
Tele&s;copes do plainly evidence to proceed from the Reflection of the Sun's
Light, and therefore none of tho&s;e can be properly &s;aid to be Luminous Bodies.
But the fixt Stars, as I have already mentioned, &s;eem to be of the &s;ame Nature
with the Body of the Sun, and therefore the &s;ame Explanation that was given
of the Light in the Sun, will &s;erve al&s;o for the Light of the Bodies of the&s;e
Stars. And thence, as I ju&s;t now mentioned, a clear Rea&s;on will be given of
divers new Stars that have appeared and di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>3. So that in Probability the Light of all the Cele&s;tial Bodies proceeds from
an actual Fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Light of the Stars from an actual Fire.</NOTE> much of the &s;ame Nature with the Fires we here have burning
upon the Earth; and therefore if we find out what is the Nature of our Fire
here with us, we may from that explain how it is generated and how it ope|rates
in the Heavens.</P>
<P>Not that I &s;uppo&s;e, that the Fuel of the Cele&s;tial Fires is the &s;ame with our
Fuel here upon the Earth, as Sulphur, Bitumen, Stone-Cole, or other combu|&s;tible
Mineral Sub&s;tances; or Woods, Re&s;ins, Oyls, or other Vegetable Sub|&s;tances,
or Fat, Bones, or &s;uch like Animal Sub&s;tances; but that it may be of
Variety of other Sub&s;tances very differing from any of the&s;e; for as all tho&s;e
I have named are much different from one another, &s;o may there be a Hun|dred
other Substances di&s;tinct from any one of the&s;e, and di&s;tinct al&s;o one from
another, all of which may notwith&s;tanding be of a Sub&s;tance fit for the Di&s;&s;o|lution
of that fluid <HI>Men&s;truum</HI> in which they &s;wim, in the &s;ame manner as
the&s;e I have named are for the Di&s;&s;olution of the <HI>Men&s;truum</HI> of the Air, and
&s;o may be fit Fuel to maintain that Cele&s;tial Fire.</P>
<P>4. We have therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Nature of Fire.</NOTE> brought our Inquiry into Subjects much nearer to us
than either the Sun or fixt Stars, and into &s;uch as are within our Command
and Reach, into &s;uch as on which we may with more Power exerci&s;e our
Scrutinies and Examinations; in which, if by our Tryals and Examinations we
can find out what the efficient Cau&s;e of Fire and Light are, we &s;hall by Ana|logy
ea&s;ily find out what is al&s;o the Cau&s;e of the Light in the Sun, and in the
fixt Stars, which Examination and Scrutiny into the Cau&s;e of Fire, and the
Light thereof, &s;hall therefore be the Subject of &s;ome of our following Di&s;|cour&s;es.</P>
<P>5. But before we leave the Contemplation of the Cele&s;tial Bodies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Comets.</NOTE> and be|gin
our <HI>Examination</HI> of Terre&s;trial or Culinary Fires, the late appearing Co|met
puts me in mind of another kind of Light, which is thought by mo&s;t to be
of a quite differing Nature from tho&s;e of the Sun, Stars, or Planets, and not
to be at all Analogous to them.</P>
<P>The great Variety of Form there has been among&s;t tho&s;e that have appeared
at &s;everal Times, and in &s;everal Ages of the World, and the great Alterations
there have happened almo&s;t in every one that appeared before it di&s;appear,
has &s;o much confounded Mens Judgments concerning them, that you &s;hall
hardly find two Men agreeing in all things, to the &s;ame Opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="135">
<HI>Seneca</HI> in the Nineteenth Chapter of his &s;eventh Book of Natural Que&s;tions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Opinions concerning them.</NOTE>
recites three Opinions concerning <HI>Comets.</HI> Some, &s;ays he, think that no Comet
does really exi&s;t, but that the Appearance thereof is made only by the Conjuncti|on
of the Rays of &s;everal Stars or Cele&s;tial Bodys into one Point, and a Reper|cu&s;&s;ion
or &s;preading of them from thence: <HI>Quidam nullos e&s;&s;e Cometas exi&s;timant,
&s;ed &s;pecies illorum per repercu&s;&s;ionem vicinorum &s;iderum, aut per Conjunctionem
vicinorum reddi.</HI></P>
<P>2. Some indeed do &s;uppo&s;e them to have a real Exi&s;tence, but to have pecu|liar
and proper Cour&s;es of their own. And that after a certain time, the &s;ame
Comets return again, and appear to us: <HI>Quidam aiunt, e&s;&s;e quidem, &s;ed habere
cur&s;us &s;uos &amp; po&s;t certa Lu&s;tra in con&s;pectum mortalium exire.</HI></P>
<P>3. Some do al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e them to have a real Being, but not &s;uch a durable
one as may de&s;erve the name of a Star, but of &s;uch a &s;ub&s;tance as does wa&s;t,
and is di&s;per&s;ed and con&s;umed after a certain time; namely, The time they
appear which is but &s;hort. <HI>Quidam, e&s;&s;e quidem, &s;ed non quibus &s;iderum nomen
imponas quia dilabuntur, nec diu durant &amp; exigui temporis mora di&s;&s;ipantur.</HI></P>
<P>So that the fir&s;t of the&s;e Opinions did &s;eem to &s;uppo&s;e that they were either
an Union of &s;everal &s;mall Stars which did really before exi&s;t, but being &s;eparate,
made no Appearance 'till united; or el&s;e that the Rays of the&s;e meeting together
in one Point by Repercu&s;&s;ion or Reflection, did &s;eem to make this Appearance.
This might well enough agree with the Opinion of the Peripateticks, and tho&s;e
that &s;uppo&s;ed the Planets and Stars fixt in &s;olid Orbs, who&s;e Motions carried
them round, and thence po&s;&s;ibly they might allude to the Focus of a Burning-Gla&s;s,
as if this Appearance were nothing el&s;e but the Rays of &s;ome Cele&s;tial Body, whether
Sun, Planet, or fixed Star, which being collected into one Point, by Reflection,
from the middle parts of the Concave of &s;ome of the &s;olid Cry&s;talline Orbs,
might there make a bright Appearance, and then the Tail would be nothing el&s;e
but the union of other Rays which fell further from the Middle or Axis of the
Concave, which unite at &s;everal Di&s;tances from it; or el&s;e that &s;ome of the&s;e
Spheres might have &s;ome parts of them of greater Refraction then others, and &s;o
by that Refraction, might collect a great Quantity of Rays diffu&s;ed from that Lu|minous
Body which was its cau&s;e, as mo&s;t probably the Sun, as the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable
Light of this part of the Univer&s;e; and unite the greate&s;t Quantity in
the Head of the Comet, and others in the Tail: And according to the&s;e Hypo|the&s;es,
the Comet would really be nothing el&s;e but a Phanta&s;m or Appearance,
and not have any real Exi&s;tence in Nature, and &s;o would not be much differing
from the appearing Meteors, &s;uch as Rainbows. The <HI>Parhelii,</HI> and the <HI>Para|&s;elenae,</HI>
the Mock-Suns and Mock-Moons, and the like; all which have no
other Exi&s;tence than the Repre&s;entation of a Body in a Looking Gla&s;s; they be|ing
indeed nothing but a Reflection or Refraction of tho&s;e Luminous Bodies
which they repre&s;ent, or are attributed to. As a Rainbow is nothing el&s;e but
the Reflection and Refraction of the Rays of the Sun from the round Drops of
Rain which fall from the Cloud, which at certain Po&s;itions to the Eye and Sun,
do by Refraction and Reflection return an extraordinary bright and coloured
Ray to the Eye, which very Drops &s;o &s;oon as ever they are out of that Po&s;ture
return not at all; this is Geometrically demon&s;trated by <HI>Maurolicus, Des Cartes,</HI>
and divers others, and may Experimentally be verified by an artificial Fountain,
ca&s;ting up and di&s;per&s;ing Water into the Air in a Mi&s;t, which will in the Sun|&s;hine
make a Rainbow. The &s;ame may be Geometrically demon&s;trated of the
<HI>Parhelii</HI> and <HI>Para&s;elenae.</HI> That all the&s;e are nothing but the Phantoms or Ap|pearances
of &s;ome other Luminous Body, made by an extraordinary Collection
and Repercu&s;&s;ion of the Rays from &s;ome other place, than that Luminous Body
&s;hould appear in, and &s;o the Cau&s;es of them may be mo&s;t certainly a&s;&s;igned
and &s;hewn, which being all Atmo&s;pherical and Aerial, and placed in the lower
Region near the Earth, they become of no long continuance, but quickly va|ni&s;h.
Now if the&s;e Refracting and Reflecting Sub&s;tances that may be &s;uppo&s;ed
the cau&s;e of the Comets this way, be &s;uppo&s;ed to be Aetherial Sub&s;tances, and
&s;o not &s;ubject to any &s;uddain Change (as the Atmo&s;phere is) the Cau&s;e re|maining
<PB N="102" REF="136">
longer; the Effect al&s;o may have a longer Exi&s;tence, and &s;o a Comet
may be &s;uppo&s;ed to la&s;t &s;ix Months or more.</P>
<P>Several have been the Opinions concerning this way, and tho&s;e very differ|ing;
&s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed the Head to be the Point where all the&s;e Rays con|centred
and met together, and there produced a kind of combu&s;tive Focus;
through which the Rays of the Sun penetrating, did afterward refract various
ways, and &s;trike forth to a va&s;t length, and from that Penetration of the fiery Fo|cus
of the Head, acquired &s;uch a Quality, as made them to become vi&s;ible; by
which means, according as this burning Point or Focus did refract more on one
&s;ide than on the other; did the Stream or Tail of the Comet appear to bend
from the &s;trait Line continued from the Sun through the middle of this Focus.
This they re&s;embled to the Radiation of the Sun between dark Clouds upon a
thick and foggy Air, which does indeed very much re&s;emble the Appearance of
the Blaze, or rather like the Rays of the Sun let in by one &s;ingle Hole, or
through a Gla&s;s into a dark Room.</P>
<P>I have only this more to add, That if &s;uch Reflecting or Refracting Bodies
could be &s;uppo&s;ed, or that we had any other Argument to prove them than on|ly
the Appearance of the Comet it felt, there would be &s;ome pretty Congruities
in the Theory that would be of &s;ome cogency to per&s;wade the Belief of this
Opinion: As, Fir&s;t, That from the Geometrical Laws both of Refraction and
Reflection, this Phantom would have a form much like that of a Comet; that
$word$ it would have a Head brighter than the re&s;t, it would have a Tail or Blaze
&s;preading from it, it would have this Tail always pretty near, oppo&s;ite to the
Sun; that is, not always directly, but &s;ometimes a little varying from the di|rect
Line, though it would &s;ometime al&s;o be directly oppo&s;ite; it would &s;ome|time
be &s;trait, but &s;ometime al&s;o be bended, &s;ometimes clear, &s;ometimes a lit|tle
coloured, and the like; which I cannot now &s;tay to in&s;i&s;t upon, but may
&s;ome other time mote fully explain. And this the rather, becau&s;e I do not find
that any one that has hitherto written of Comets, has in the lea&s;t mentioned
any Explication like this; nor does <HI>Seneca</HI> at all explain what the Opinion re|ally
was: But upon con&s;idering of various ways how to &s;olve the Phaenomena,
and how al&s;o to explain the Words of <HI>Seneca,</HI> among&s;t others, I pitch'd on this,
of which I &s;hall upon another Occa&s;ion &s;peak more fully, and &s;hew wherein al|&s;o
the Objections lie again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hevelius</HI> &s;eems to give another kind of Solution of the Tail or Blaze of
Comets, which though it does,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hevelius's</HI> Opinion examined</NOTE> <HI>toto Caelo,</HI> differ from this I have now explained;
yet it may not improperly be made u&s;e of to explain this fir&s;t Opinion men|tioned
by <HI>Seneca.</HI> He then &s;uppo&s;es that the Tail or Blaze, is really nothing el&s;e
but the Rays of the Sun, which in pa&s;&s;ing through a nebulous Body, &s;uch as
he conceives the Head to be, are refracted, and reflected by the <HI>Nucleus</HI> or <HI>Nu|clei,</HI>
if it have more than one, by which Conden&s;ation, Decu&s;&s;ation and Col|lection
of tho&s;e Rays he &s;uppo&s;es the Blaze to be formed; now though, indeed,
he does &s;uppo&s;e the Head of the Comet to be a di&s;tinct Sub&s;tance, and &s;o falls
in or agrees with the Third Opinion; yet as to the Tail, he &s;uppo&s;es it a meer
Phantom, and to have no real Exi&s;tence in Nature.</P>
<P>But again&s;t this Suppo&s;ition there are many Objections; as fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This &s;uppo&s;ition concerning Comet re&s;$$$d.</NOTE> though the
Blaze of the Comet does &s;ometime re&s;emble the Radiation of the Sun between
the Clouds, upon a thick Air below tho&s;e Clouds, as it did in this pre&s;ent
Comet, when the Blaze appeared brighte&s;t and longe&s;t, yet 'twill be very hard
to make out the Similitude well in a Comet; for the&s;e Radiations under the
Clouds appear brighter than the re&s;t of the Air, becau&s;e all the re&s;t of this thick
Air under them is &s;hadowed and darkned by the interpo&s;ition of the Clouds,
and tho&s;e that appear bright, do &s;o, becau&s;e the Sun &s;hines clearly upon them
between tho&s;e Clouds. But in the Comet we want, fir&s;t the Cloud, or &s;ome|what
that &s;hould darken the <HI>Aether</HI> round about the Blaze; I &s;ay the <HI>Aether,</HI>
becau&s;e, as I &s;hall afterwards &s;hew, all Comets that have been accurately ob&s;er|ved,
and thence, in probability, all Comets what&s;oever have appeared, to be ve|ry
far removed above the Air, then in probability this dark Body would hinder
the view of &s;ome part of the Blaze. Secondly, We find that the&s;e Radiations
between the Clouds never happen but when the Air underneath the Clouds is
thick and &s;omewhat opacous, without which they cannot appear; but when
<PB N="103" REF="137">
&s;hall we find &s;uch an opacous Air to reflect the Light into the Heavens. It
would be much more difficult to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a va&s;t &s;pace of the <HI>Aether</HI> to be
thickned (as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be) to make out this Appearance; than to &s;up|po&s;e
only &s;o much Matter as may ju&s;t &s;erve to make the Bigne&s;s of the Blaze it
&s;elf, which though it be prodigiou&s;ly long, as &s;ome thou&s;ands of the Earths Dia|meters,
yet &s;till 'tis ea&s;ier to conceive how there may be matter enough to make a
Cylinder, than to make &s;o va&s;t a Body as an Orb of the <HI>Aether</HI> of that thickne&s;s.
But then, Thirdly, There is nothing in the &s;hape of the Head of the Comet
that does any ways re&s;emble the perforation of a Body that &s;hould &s;hadow the
re&s;t of the <HI>Aether</HI> about the Blaze. For as I &s;hall afterwards &s;hew you, Comets
do generally appear to have a brighter Body in the middle, about which there
is a kind of White Cloud, from which the Blaze does &s;eem to i&s;&s;ue. So that,
in truth, they have no rea&s;on at all for this Suppo&s;ition or Opinion, and it has
in probability &s;prung, and had its fir&s;t ri&s;e from tho&s;e who &s;uppo&s;ed Comets to
be nothing el&s;e but &s;ome &s;mall Appearance here in the Air below: But &s;ince, as
I &s;aid before, It has been by &s;o many and &s;o exact A&s;tronomical Ob&s;ervations
found, that &s;ome of the&s;e Comets are very high in the Heavens, and far remo|ved
beyond the Bounds of the Air, that groundle&s;s Opinion may al&s;o be di&s;|charged,
and yet I find mo&s;t of our A&s;tronomerrs and Philo&s;ophers do incline to
be of that Opinion, as particularly <HI>Des Cartes, Fromundus, Kepler, Cy&s;atus, Riccio|lus,
Gremaldi</HI> &amp;c. who though they do all a&s;&s;ign the real Body to the Comet,
yet as to the Blaze, that they &s;uppo&s;e to be made by the tran&s;it of the Suns
Rays through the Cloudy part of the Head. And <HI>Hevelius</HI> al&s;o, the late&s;t
Writer of Comets, is of this Opinion, not as if it were made by the pa&s;&s;ing of
the Rays through a Hole, as in a dark Room, but by the Refraction and Col|lection
of the Rays in the Cloudy, and yet tran&s;parent Body or Head of the
Comet. Now this Body or Head he does not &s;uppo&s;e Spherical or Globular,
and to collect the Rays of the Sun beyond it into a Focus, as a Gla&s;s Globe full
of Water would do; but to be of the form of a Di&s;h or Boat, and to con&s;i&s;t of
various &s;orts of Bodies, &s;ome Round, and &s;ome Angular, which do variou&s;ly
Reflect and Refract the Rays of the Sun, and &s;o make them unite and cro&s;s
each other in various Ways on that &s;ide of the Comet which is oppo&s;ite to the
Sun, but becau&s;e he could not well conceive how the&s;e Rays &s;hould come to be
con&s;picuous, unle&s;s there were &s;ome opacous reflecting Body behind the Comet,
as there is in the Air when the Radiations before mentioned are &s;een below the
Clouds, therefore he has &s;uppo&s;ed a va&s;t Collection of Vapours or halituous
Sub&s;tances, proceeding partly from the Sun, and partly from the re&s;t of the
Planets, as &Saturn;, &Jupit;, &Mars;, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be made beyond the Body of the Comet, that is
on that &s;ide that is oppo&s;ite to the Sun, and the&s;e he &s;uppo&s;es to be very much
more thin than the Air or Atmo&s;phere about the Earth; and therefore, that a
little quantity of Matter will go a great way in that Collection: Upon this ha|lituous
Matter the Radiations falling, he &s;uppo&s;es, are Reflected, and &s;o the ap|pearance
of the Blaze is generated. <HI>Kepler</HI> was aware that there was a nece&s;|&s;ity
of &s;uch a kind of halituous Sub&s;tance as this mentioned by <HI>Hevelius;</HI> but
yet, con&s;idering the va&s;t extent of the Blaze of &s;ome Comets, namely, to 40,
50, 60, nay 90; and if we may believe&mdash;to 110 Degrees in length; and
that this Angle mu&s;t be &s;ubtended by the Tail, as a &s;trait Line, which in &s;ome
Cafes will run it out to a va&s;ter length than if it were only a Circular Extent,
he could not conceive whence all that matter &s;hould be brought. But <HI>Hevelius</HI>
has found out whence to fetch it; namely, from the Orbs and Bodies of the
Planets; for &s;ince, &s;ays he, we are a&s;&s;ured, <HI>Quod tam immen&s;a materiarum Con|geries,
umbrarum &s;cilicet primariarum circa maculas &amp; circa ip&s;um Solem &s;ecun|dariarum
in longe adhuc majori quantitate quando&abque; reperiatur, uti&abque; non ab&s;ur|dum
quo&abque; e&s;t ctiam tales expirationes tenuiores etiam circa Cometas dari, Nam
dum non raro pene omnium Planetarum Orbes trajiciunt, multum ubi&abque; materiae at|trahunt
averrunt&abque; &s;ecum, adeo ut brevi&s;&s;imo temporis Spatio cum motu veloci&s;&s;imo
gaudent va&s;ti&s;&s;imum &s;ubtili&s;&s;imarum i&s;tarum exhalationum cumulum, ad eaudam re|fringendam
convenientem coacervare po&s;&s;int.</HI> But to this Opinion of his, it may be
objected, that, fir&s;t, as to the Collection of halituous Sub&s;tances, if &s;uch were
made in its Pa&s;&s;age then in probabiliy this would be in that part of it which came
behind it in its Motion, and &s;o con&s;equently the Tail &s;hould always appear in that
Line which the Comet has pa&s;t; as we may often ob&s;erve in the &s;mall Meteors to
<PB N="104" REF="138">
be &s;een in a clear Night called Star-&s;hootings, many of which do leave a kind
of Glade of Light behind them in the way through which they have pa&s;t. So
he gives no manner of Rea&s;on why it Should be oppo&s;ite to the Sun, nor indeed is
his Explication at all natural, but altogether forced, and Extraneous from any
other Method or Operation in Nature, nor is it built upon the Appearances,
for as I &s;hall afterwards &s;hew, had he well heeded tho&s;e, they would have
hinted &s;ome other ways of explicating the&s;e <HI>Phaenomena.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould have here left this Opinion; but that I was this Week informed from
<HI>France</HI> of a Per&s;on <HI>D. Anthelme,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anthelme's</HI> Opinion ex|amined.</NOTE> a <HI>Carthu&s;ian</HI> of <HI>Dijon,</HI> who pretends to have
a true Theory of Comets, and to be able to predict them; and accordingly hath
put out an Ephemerides of this pre&s;ent Comet, therein not only &s;etting down
what he had ob&s;erved before the Publication, but what &s;hould happen after|wards
'till the time of its di&s;appearing. This Man I mention not for his pre|dicting
of the Way and Motion of the Comet, for that I think may be much
more exactly done than what he has, by the way I have publi&s;hed in my <HI>Come|ta,</HI>
which was invented by Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Wren;</HI> by which, from any four Ob|servations
truly made, one may certainly find the Line, Di&s;tance, Motion, Inclina|tion
to the Ecliptick, its place among the fixt Stars, the length of its Tail, Bright|ne&s;s,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o long as it &s;hall appear to the naked Eye; for &s;o long that Theory
will hold pretty near; I do not therefore mention this <HI>French</HI> Author for that,
but to &s;hew that he that is far out of the way in his Conjectures about the
form of the Comet, which he &s;uppo&s;es al&s;o to be made by the Refraction of the
Sun's Rays, the Opinion we have now exploded, and &s;hall hereafter more de|mon&s;tratively
confute from undeniable Arguments; this Man, in probability, is
as much out in his Theory, which is only this, that the Head or Body of the
Comet is Transparent, and that the Tail is made by the Refraction of the Sun|beams
through it, but does not &s;eem to have considered the Difficulty which
<HI>Kepler, Hevelius,</HI> and divers others had taken notice of, and provided for in
this Hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>I could relate to you the Opinions of many other Authors who have inclined
to this Opinion, that the Blaze of the Comet is nothing but a Phantom or Ap|pearance,
but that as I find the very be&s;t of them that have imbraced this Opi|nion,
to have been very dark and perplexed in their Explications; and as if they
had not well under&s;tood it them&s;elves, &s;o there are others who only give a bare
A&s;&s;ertion without any Explication or Rea&s;on at all: The Authority of &s;uch Men,
I confe&s;s, weighs very little with me.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore pa&s;s on to the &s;econd &s;ort of Opinions, and that was of &s;uch
as &s;uppo&s;ed them to be Aerial, Halituous and Sulphureous Bodies placed &s;ome|where
in or near the Atmo&s;phere, which was rai&s;ed out of the Earth, and fired
in the upper Regions of the Air, and there continued 'till they wa&s;ted away. Of
this Opinion was the great Philo&s;oher <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> and almo&s;t all his Followers;
nay many of them, to this Day, who have not taken the Pains to be better in|&s;tructed.
Of this Opinion we find generally ail the Stoicks, but that they &s;up|po&s;e
them elevated from the Air into the <HI>Aether;</HI> al&s;o the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> and all
Hi&s;torians, who have mentioned Comets in their Political Hi&s;tory: Of this O|pinion
are almo&s;t all the Illiterate and Ignorant People of the World, and al|mo&s;t
ever have been, and ever will be; becau&s;e they are for the mo&s;t part ru|led
by the mo&s;t obvious Appearance to the Sen&s;e, without taking Pains to make
u&s;e of their Rea&s;on to examine things &s;trictly; &s;o that if the majority of Votes
be an Argument for the Truth of any Opinion, certainly this will carry it from
all the re&s;t, at lea&s;t a Hundred Thou&s;and to One. And yet, after all this, <HI>Ari|&s;totle,</HI>
his Commentators, his Followers, the greate&s;t number of Scholars, and
particularly the Stoick Philo&s;ophers, as well as Peripatetick, the Hi&s;torians, Di|vines,
many Phy&s;itians, and all the Illiterate <HI>Vulgus</HI> in the World, will be
found quite mi&s;taken in their Opinion, and will ea&s;ily be confuted by the A&s;tro|nomers
and modern Philo&s;ophers, who have clearly and plainly demon&s;trated
their Mi&s;take and Error. And that is, by undeniably proving the va&s;t distance
tho&s;e Bodies are removed from the Earth by the Parallax, or rather want of
Parallax, which they have been of later Ages certainly ob&s;erved to have; for
that does mo&s;t certainly and infallibly &s;hew that they are &s;o far from being
Aerial or Atmo&s;pherical, as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e, that they are &s;eldom,
<PB N="105" REF="139">
if ever &s;o low as the Moon, many times as far off as the Sun, and &s;ometimes
perhaps much farther; I &s;ay perhaps, becau&s;e the Evidence for that is not as
yet &s;o ea&s;ily attainable, for no one has yet certainly proved the Parallax of the
Sun, nor of <HI>Mars</HI> to any exactne&s;s; much le&s;s have they of the &s;uperior Bodies.</P>
<P><HI>Johannes Regiomontanus,</HI> was the fir&s;t among the Moderns, who began to ele|vate
the Po&s;itions of Comets above the Air or Atmo&s;phere; for by his Ob&s;er|vations
of that which appeared in the Year 1472, he found it by its Parallax, di|&s;tant
eight Semidiameters of the Earth at lea&s;t, which is very far above the
reach of the Air, which tho&s;e, that with any probabilty judge of its Altitude, at
mo&s;t make, not above Twenty Miles Perpendicular, but in all probability is yet
much le&s;s. But <HI>Ticho Brahe,</HI> and at the &s;ame time <HI>Rothmannus</HI> Mathematical
Profe&s;&s;or to the <HI>Landgrave of Ha&s;&s;ia, Michael Me&s;tline, Cornelius Gemma,
Maddeus Heggetius,</HI> and many others (too many to be named at pre&s;ent) who
had made Ob&s;ervations of the Comets that appeared in the Years, 1577, 1580,
1585, 1590, 1593. did all clearly find and prove that they had all of them
le&s;s Parallax than the Moon, and con&s;equently that they mu&s;t be far above it;
and with them agree almo&s;t all the Learned A&s;tronomers &s;ince, only <HI>Galileo</HI>
would &s;eem to make it only a Phantom &s;omewhat like a <HI>Halo,</HI> which changed
Its place according to the Po&s;ition of the Eye that &s;aw it, and thence would
give a Rea&s;on why it could have no Parallax; for &s;ince its being or Po&s;ition
depended only upon the Refraction and Reflection of the Sun's Rays; according
to him, its Di&s;tance or Angle with the Sun would appear the &s;ame where-ever
the Eye were placed to time it; and, con&s;equently, it would ob&s;erve and keep
the &s;ame Po&s;ition among&s;t the fixt Stars in the Zenith, as in the Horizon; &s;up|po&s;ing
it elevated &s;o far only above the Earth, or at lea&s;t, &s;o po&s;ited, as not to
fall in its Shadow. But this Explication of this great Wit, and mo&s;t excellent
Philo&s;opher and Mathematician <HI>Galileo,</HI> though it be very &s;ubtil and curious,
and has &s;ome &s;eeming probability, yet the &s;trict Examination of the Appear|ances
by the known Laws of Refraction and Reflection, will &s;ufficiently &s;hew
the In&s;ufficiency of that Solution; and &s;hould the Examination of tho&s;e not
have been &s;ufficient to have confuted this Suppo&s;ition from the endeavouring to
&s;olve the common Appearances of Comets to the Naked Eye; yet the Impo&s;|&s;ibility
to have &s;olved the Appearances of them through the Tele&s;cope would
have &s;ufficiently confuted it. But &s;etting him a&s;ide, all the con&s;iderable A&s;tro|nomers
who have &s;ince written of Comets, do conclude them not to be Sublu|nary,
but far removed above the Moon, and Aethereal. Such were almo&s;t all
tho&s;e who writ of that great and very bright Comet which appeared to the
World in the Year 1618. And &s;uch are tho&s;e that have writ of Comets that
have appeared &s;ince; and more particularly, of tho&s;e two great ones which
appeared in the End of 1664, and in the beginning of the Year <HI>1665.</HI> Many
of which are compri&s;ed in the <HI>Theatrum Cometicum,</HI> Printed in the Year 1667.</P>
<P>This is then the Third Opinion mentioned by <HI>Sencca,</HI> as the &s;econd to be held
by divers of the Antients. Namely, That Comets were Aethereal Bodies, placed
at a great Di&s;tance from the Earth, and there moved according to Rules pecu|liar
to them only, and di&s;tinct from the fixt Stars, and constantly appearing
Planets.</P>
<P>What Arguments the Antients had to make them of this Opinion, does not
appear any more, than it doth why they held divers others; many of which have
been with great Applau&s;e, and very good Rea&s;on taken up, and received by
many of our late Philo&s;ophers: But certain it is, 'twas not without &s;ome very
good Grounds; otherwi&s;e, 'tis not to be conceived how they &s;hould be able to
hit upon them: As, Particularly that of <HI>Ari&s;tarchus Samius</HI> or <HI>Philolaus,</HI> who
A&s;&s;erted the Sun to be the Center of the Univer&s;e; and that all the Planets,
and the Earth among the re&s;t, which mu&s;t therefore be e&s;teemed one of them,
moved round about it, that remaining fixt. Which Opinion was received by
<HI>Copernicus,</HI> and has been &s;ince followed by the mo&s;t knowing A&s;tronomers.
'Tis not therefore to be doubted, but that the Antients might have &s;ome of the
&s;ame Rea&s;onings for them that we now have; and po&s;&s;ibly many other, which
length of time has devoured; and 'tis not Improbable what <HI>Simon Steven</HI> has
indeavoured to prove, and the learned <HI>Hugo Grotius</HI> has helped him to many
Arguments for it; that there was before any of the Hi&s;tories now extant, of
<PB N="106" REF="140">
Prophane Writers, a learned Age and Place of the World far exceeding that
of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> or <HI>Greece;</HI> of which we have no manner of Hi&s;tory conveyed down
to us, but &s;ome few &s;craps and hints here and there &s;cattered up and down in
&s;ome of the Writings of the Antients. 'Tis not improbable, but &s;ome &s;ucceed|ing
Ages and Sects of Men might indu&s;triou&s;ly de&s;troy them (which was no
difficult thing to do before Printing was in u&s;e) as 'tis &s;aid of <HI>Ari&s;totle.</HI> But
whatever was the cau&s;e, is uncertain; It is therefore much ea&s;ier to find out the
Truth by new Inquiry into the Nature of the Things them&s;elves, than to hunt
for the Cau&s;es of' things among the Worm-eaten Volumes of Antiquity. We
&s;hall therefore pa&s;s over the &s;everal Branches of Opinions under this Head, of
the Aethereal Nature of the Comets, and come to the various Opinions that
have been a&s;&s;erted and defended by the Moderns, who&s;e Grounds and Rea&s;ons
we may ea&s;ily know.</P>
<P>There are then under this Head, great variety of Opinions, as to the Sub|&s;tance,
Light, Magnitude, Di&s;tance, Motion, Duration, Generation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of
Cele&s;tial Comets. But they may be reduced to the&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was, That Comets were certain Planets or wandering Stars, the
Laws or Rules of whole Motions were not yet known, and which were di&s;tant
from the Seven Planets that were known. Of this Opinion were the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI>
as al&s;o <HI>Democritus.</HI> And that thereupon, why they did but &s;ometimes only ap|pear,
and then vani&s;h, was by rea&s;on of their Approaching and Receding from
the Earth in their proper Cour&s;e, or by rea&s;on of their nearne&s;s to the Sun.
<HI>Plutarch,</HI> al&s;o, &s;ays, that &s;ome of the <HI>Pythagoreans</HI> al&s;o, were of that Opini|on:
<HI>Seneca,</HI> al&s;o, held the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Opinion is, That the Body and Tail of the the Comet is made up
only by the conflux of many &s;mall, and, before, imperceptible Stars; and that
the Rea&s;on of their di&s;appearing is, becau&s;e tho&s;e Stars are again di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Third Opinion is, that the Comets are made <HI>De novo,</HI> out of the <HI>Mate|ria
Coele&s;tis.</HI> Every of the&s;e are varied by &s;everal Suppo&s;itions about the Blaze,
of which more hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Here our Author breaks off, and leaves this Di&s;cour&s;e of Comets imper|fect,
&s;o that I was in &s;ome doubt whether I &s;hould publi&s;h it; but con&s;idering it
contained a brief Explication of &s;everal Opinions of the Antients, and &s;ome of the
Moderns, of the Nature of Comets; I thought it might not be unacceptable to the
Reader. I &s;hall in &s;ome following Sheets pre&s;ent you with a pretty large Treati&s;e

made on tho&s;e in 1680, and 1681.</P>

<HEAD>The CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<Q>1. A Recapitulation of &s;ome former Particulars, as to the Three Properties
of Light, <HI>viz.</HI> its incomprehen&s;ible Exten&s;ion, prodigious Swiftne&s;s of its
Mo$ion, and yet the Limitation of its Power, &s;o as to admit the Rules of
Compari&s;on, of Majority, Minority and Equality. Light falls under a
threefold Consideration, as it is in the Luminous Body, as it is in the
Medium, as it is in the Eye. Luminous Bodies are Cele&s;tial or Terre&s;tri|al;
Cele&s;tial are &s;uch as &s;hine by their own Light, as the Sun, and fixt
Stars or Comets, all which are actual Fires: The Authors Theory of Comets,
That the Planets except the Sun have no Light of their own. 2. The
con&s;ideration of Bodies within our reach emitting Light, which are reduced
to five Cla&s;&s;es. 1&s;t. All Sulphureous, Re&s;inous and Spirituous Bodies.
Here is a&s;hort Explication of Fire, and the Life of Animals, 2dly, Bo|dies
not combu&s;tible yet that will &s;hine with a certain Degree of Heat.
3dly, Such as &s;hine by an inward Fermentation without Heat, 4thly, Such
as &s;hine by an Impre&s;&s;ion of Light. 5thly, Such as &s;hine by Motion.
3. The&s;e are to be the Guides into the Nature of Light. The Definition
or Description of Light, what it is. The Proof and Confirmation there|of.
That the <HI>M$dium</HI> of it is perfectly Den&s;e. <HI>Bulialdus</HI>'s Notion of
Light rejected. That Light is a Corporeal Sub&s;tance, that it perfectly fills
Exten&s;ion or Quantity extended every Way, that it is &s;u&s;ceptive and
communicative of Motion. 4. The Motion of Light, in the Con&s;iderati|on
of which are ob&s;ervable, The Quantity, Quality and Power thereof.
The&s;e explained. The cau&s;e of Sound. Heat only an internal Motion of
the Parts: A certain Degree of Heat or of this Internal Motion produces
Light. Light in <HI>objecto,</HI> is a peculiar kind of this internal Motion, and
the Propagation of this Motion is Light in the <HI>Medium. R. W.</HI></Q>
<P>1. I Was the la&s;t Term diverted from proceeding with the Explication of
Light I had begun to di&s;cour&s;e of in &s;ome of my former Lectures, by the
Appearance of the Comet, which &s;eems to give a Light very differing from
tho&s;e of other Cele&s;tial Bodies: I was therefore the more willing upon that
Occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e on the Light of that Body, having before di&s;cour&s;ed of
the Light of the Sun and Stars. But it was with a De&s;ign of Re&s;uming the Di|&s;cour&s;e
of Light in General; for that a clear Under&s;tanding and Explication
of it, will very much facilitate the Knowledge and Science of many other ab|&s;tru&s;e
and difficult Operations in Nature. For the doing of which as it ought,
<PB N="108" REF="142">
much u&s;e mu&s;t be made of Geometry. And, indeed, without it little can be
done, that will any ways intelligibly inform us concerning it. General and in|definite
A&s;&s;ertions and De&s;criptions do but imperfectly inform, and the De|duction
from &s;uch Propo&s;itions mu&s;t be uncertain, and of a dubious Sen&s;e; and
defective of Form, becau&s;e they want the nece&s;&s;ary Limits and Boundaries.
Whereas, on the other &s;ide, where the Definitions are &s;trict and exact, and the
Deductions clo&s;e and nece&s;&s;ary, the Science thence derived is Po&s;itive and De|mon&s;trative,
and will admit of no manner of He&s;itancy, or Contradiction.</P>
<P>The Proprieties I have taken notice of were,</P>
<P>1. The Incomprehen&s;ible Exten&s;ion of its Propagation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Recapitulation of the Three Prop$ieties of Light.</NOTE> boundle&s;s and unli|mited
as the Univer&s;e, and yet really affecting every Attom or Point of the
Medium or Ma&s;s of Created Body, and this not only of the tran&s;parent Medi|um,
but as I conceive, and &s;hall hereafter explain and &s;hew my Rea&s;ons for it,
even every Atom and Point of Opacous Bodies al&s;o; &s;e that no one Atom
or Particle of created Body is free from its Power; and be the Extent thereof
never &s;o Immen&s;e (as who&s;e Imagination can &s;et Limits to Exten&s;ion) yet the
whole, and every part thereof is really affected by the Power of Light.</P>
<P>Secondly, The prodigious Swiftne&s;s, or rather In&s;tantaneou&s;ne&s;s of this Pro|pagation;
&s;o that it &s;eems to exert its Power to all imaginable Di&s;tance in an
In&s;tant of time; &s;o that at the &s;ame In&s;tant that the Lucid Body emits its
Light, or exerts it Power, the Receptive Body though never &s;o far di&s;tant is af|fected
by it; and this without any re&s;pect to the va&s;t &s;pace interpo&s;ed, &s;o that
a Body a Million of Millions of Miles di&s;tant, is affected as &s;oon as a Body di|stant
but a Span, &s;o that it may be &s;aid to outpa&s;s the quickne&s;s of our
Thought; for that we mu&s;t think of one thing after another. And though
&s;ome ingenious Men, as Mon$ier <HI>Romer</HI> have indeavoured to prove it to be
temporaneous, and to &s;pend &s;ome time in pa&s;&s;ing from the Illuminating to the
Illuminated Body, thereby thinking to make it more Intelligible and Adequate
to other Powers and Operations of the Univer&s;e; yet he &s;uppo&s;ing that time to
be &s;o incredibly &s;hort, in compari&s;on to the length of the Space it pa&s;&s;es, as he
allows but one &s;ingle &s;econd of time, or the &s;ixtyth part of a Minute of an
Hour for the time in which it pa&s;&s;es the Di&s;tance of about 20000 Miles; is
makes it much more difficult to conceive &s;o rapid a temporaneous Motion,
than the In&s;tantaneou&s;ne&s;s of that other. For the Motion of a Cannon Bullet
is as much flower than this of Light, as the Motion of a Snail is than that of
a Cannon Bullet.</P>
<P>The Third Propriety of Light which I took notice of, was, that though its
Expan&s;ion &s;eems to be indefinite, and its Motion In&s;tantaneous, or infinitely
&s;wift; yet that its Power was finite, and limited and &s;ubjected to the Laws
of Quantity, and admitted of the Rules of Compari&s;on, of Majority, of Minori|ty,
and Equality, which nothing that is infinite is &s;ubjected to; and upon this
Account it is, that it falls under the Con&s;ideration of Geometry.</P>
<P>1. I &s;hall now begin with a more particular Con&s;ideration of Light; and
therein I &s;hall con&s;ider what Light is, that has the&s;e admirable Proprieties-Re&s;erving
the explication of &s;everal other Proprieties of it altogether as won,
derful, 'till I have a little further explained the&s;e, and &s;hewn how the&s;e are produced by it.</P>
<P>Light then will fall under a Threefold Con&s;ideration; Fir&s;t, As it is in the
Luminous Body. Secondly, As it is in the <HI>Medium</HI> that conveys it. And,
Thirdly, As it affects the Eye, by means of which, we come to the Knowledge
of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The Luminous Objects are either Cele&s;tial or Terre&s;trial&punc;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Three-fold Con&s;ideration of Light.</NOTE> of each of which,
there are &s;ome that &s;hine by their own Light, and &s;ome that &s;hine by Light re|flected
from them, but derived from another Luminous Body.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="143">
The Principal of the Cele&s;tial (at lea&s;t as to us) is the S&uuml;n,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cele&s;tial Lumi|nous Objects.</NOTE> which for ought
we yet certainly know, is the Principal and Brighte&s;t Body in the World. I have
already explained &s;omewhat of the Nature of that Body as to its bigne&s;s, its
turbinated Motion, its Atmo&s;phere, its <HI>Nebulae, Macuiae</HI> and <HI>Faculae,</HI> and their
Proprieties and Motions, and thence gave &s;ome probable Conjecture of the Con|&s;titution
and Sub&s;tance of i$, and concerning the manner how it comes to give
Light; and I &s;hew'd you many Rea&s;ons why, in all likelyhood, the Light of the
Sun might proceed from an actual Fire, &s;omewhat Analogous to the Fire of Bo|dies
burning with us; whence from an under&s;tanding of the Nature of Fire,
Flame and Light here within our Reach and Command, we might the better
be inabled to examine and judge of the nature of Light in general; for if the Ce|$e&s;tial
Lights are Analogous, and much of the &s;ame Nature with the Bodies that
give Light with us, then the Knowledge of the one will explain the other.</P>
<P>Next, I began to &s;hew &s;ome Rea&s;ons why in Probability the &s;ixt Stars were
of the &s;ame Nature with the Sun, as to this Propriety of Emitting Light: For,
that fir&s;t, they were Bodies &s;ome of them va&s;tly Di&s;tant, as I have, I think,
experimentally proved by the Ob&s;ervation I made of the pa&s;&s;ing of Stars near
the <HI>Zenith;</HI> and con&s;equently they mu&s;t be va&s;tly big. Thence, Thirdly, They
mu&s;t emit a very &s;trong and vivid Light, &s;ince at &s;o va&s;t a Di&s;tance they do &s;o
&s;en&s;ibly almo&s;t Dazle the Eye; for the Power of Light, as I &s;hew'd before,
though it be in&s;tantaneous and indefinite in Exten&s;ion, doth yet continually Di|mini&s;h
in its Power, the farther it acts from the Lucid Fountain; and this not
in a Simple but Duplicate Proportion to the Di&s;tance; &s;o that a Body a Hundred
times further Di&s;tant, receives not a 10000 Part of the Light. But then,
Secondly, 'Tis probable, that they are actual Fires, as I indeavoured to prove
the &s;ame, from &s;ome remarkable In&s;tances we have had of &s;ome of them that
have, as it were, blazed out upon a &s;uddain, and after a &s;hort &s;pace, quite
burnt out, &s;o as never to appear &s;ince; as that remarkable Star in 1572, which
was &s;o accurately ob&s;erved by the Noble <HI>Ticho Brahe,</HI> and &s;ome others of that
Nature; and by &s;ome others, which &s;ometimes appear, and &s;ometimes di&s;ap|pear
again, as that in <HI>Collo Ceti.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, I &s;hew'd why al&s;o Comets were Bodies that &s;hined by their own
Light, and did not receive their Light from the Sun, but from a Principle of
their own; and this I have &s;hewn to be very much of the &s;ame Nature with our
Fire. And by very many Ob&s;ervations I have made of the la&s;t Great Comet, I
am confirmed that the Light of that va&s;tly great Blaze, which at &s;ometimes
was extended to &s;o great a length, as to &s;ubtend an Angle of almo&s;t Ninty De|grees,
and to be of the breadth of near Three; was wholly from it &s;elf, and
was not cau&s;ed by the Reflections of the Light of the <HI>Sun;</HI> and that all that
Stream i&s;&s;ued from the Body or Head, mu&s;t after the &s;ame manner, as the
flame of a Candle does i&s;&s;ue from the Weik; and therefore from all Circum|&s;tances
I could ob&s;erve of it, and from what I took notice of in the former
Comets; I judge it to be a Body actually on Fire, or in a State of Di&s;&s;olution,
and that it con&s;i&s;ts of burning Materials, but much differing from the Sub&s;tance
of the Sun and fixt Stars, which afford a more pure, &s;trong and defecated Light,
whereas this is more blended with a kind of Smoke, or Hetrogeneous Vapours,
which are con&s;umed whil&s;t they are in the Blaze, in the &s;ame manner, as the
Smoke of a burning Body here with us is con&s;umed by the kindling of it into
Flame, as it a&s;cends from the &s;moaking or &s;teaming Body; as may be ob&s;erv|ed
in the Burning of a Tallow or Wax Candle, or of Oyi, Spirit of Wine, or
the like in a Lamp. The&s;e therefore are the Cele&s;tial Bodies that emit Light
of their own; in all which, the Original or Cau&s;e of it &s;eems to be nothing
el&s;e but an actual Fire, and to be Analogous, or very much of kin to the Fires,
that con&s;ume Terre&s;trial Bodies, and therefore our Inquiry for the cau&s;e of Light
is brought &s;omewhat nearer to us, and more within our reach, and therefore we
may with the greater Ea&s;e and Certainty find out the true Cau&s;e and Nature of it.</P>
<P>For as to all the other Cele&s;tial Bodies, <HI>viz.</HI> the Moon, and the re&s;t of the
primary and &s;ecundary Planets, 'tis very evident that they do not &s;hine by their
own proper Light, but by the help of that of the Sun, which is reflected from
<PB N="110" REF="144">
them to us. For if we con&s;ider the Moon, 'tis very evident not only from the
Increa&s;e and Decrea&s;e of Light, which make the Appearances and Pha&s;es of
the Increasing and Decrea&s;ing of the Moon, and from the Eclip&s;es both of the
Sun and Moon, which have very long been Ob&s;erved and Explained by this
Theory, the Dark Body of the Moon eclip&s;ing the Sun, and the Interpo&s;ition
of the Earth between the Sun and the Moon, eclip&s;ing the Moon; but from the
very Shadows of the Protuberant and Craggy Parts of the Moon upon the
Surface of its Body; for tho&s;e Shadows may, with a Tele&s;cope, be as plainly
&s;een as the Shadow of the Stile of a Dial, and the Motion and Change thereof
may be as plainly al&s;o &s;een, and the Progre&s;s of the Light of the Sun upon the
Sur&s;ace of that Body. But whereas &s;ome object that the &s;ecundary and faint
Light of the Moon, which is &s;ometimes remarkable in total Eclip&s;es, &s;eems to
be a proper Light of the Body it &s;elf, 'tis now evident enough that, as <HI>Kepler</HI>
well ob&s;erved, that Light proceeds from the Refractions of the Sun's Light in
the Atmo&s;phere about the Earth, where it is refracted towards the <HI>Axis</HI> of the
<HI>Umbra</HI> of the Earth; and as for that of the New Moon, that is cau&s;ed by the Re|flection
of the Sun's Light from the Surface of the Earth; for that 'tis very
plain, that as the Light of that Decrea&s;es, as it does when the A&s;pect is chang|ed,
and a le&s;s part of the inlightned Surface of the Earth reflects to the Moon,
as from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t Quadrature, that &s;ecundary or faint Light vani&s;hes
and is no more vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>Next, As to the Light of the other Planets, 'tis very clear that they Receive
what they Reflect, from the Sun; for 'tis plain, that <HI>Mercury,</HI> when it has
pa&s;&s;ed between us and the <HI>Sun,</HI> has appeared a &s;mall Dark Spot, and &s;ome have
affirmed to have &s;een the Pha&s;e of it through a Tele&s;cope, to appear Horned like
a New Moon, though I never yet ob&s;erved it &s;o my &s;elf. But as for <HI>Venus,</HI> I
have very often ob&s;erved the Changes in her, and found her as &s;harp as the
Moon, two days before or after the Conjunction, without the lea&s;t Appearance
of Light on the other part of her Body; and <HI>Mars</HI> I have ob&s;erved a little
wained, but as for <HI>Jupiter,</HI> I have divers times plainly &s;een the Shadow of
one of the <HI>Satellites</HI> pa&s;s over its Disk, as well as the <HI>Satellites</HI> eclip&s;ed by the
Shadow of the Body of <HI>Jupiter;</HI> &s;o that both the Body of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and the <HI>Sa|tellites</HI>
about it, do &s;hine only from the Reflection of the Light of the <HI>Sun.</HI>
We have no rea&s;on to doubt but that the Light of <HI>Saturn</HI> and its <HI>Satellites</HI> pro|ceed
from the &s;ame Cau&s;e, and that becau&s;e as the Body of <HI>Saturn</HI> is &s;o much
further removed both from the <HI>Sun</HI> and us, &s;o the Light is con&s;iderably more
Dull and Weak. And be&s;ides, I have &s;everal times plainly &s;een the Shadow of
the Ring upon <HI>Saturn,</HI> which could not be, if the cau&s;e of its Light did not pro|ceed
from the <HI>Sun.</HI> So that upon the whole, we have &s;ufficient Grounds to
conclude that the Light of all the Planets proceeds from the Light of the Sun
reflected from them to us; and con&s;equently, that the emitted Light of all Ce|le&s;tial
Bodies is much of the Nature of the Lights of the Fires we have here up|on
the Earth.</P>
<P>2. We come then in the nest place to con&s;ider &s;uch Bodies as are within our
reach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Terre&s;trial Lu|minous Objects.</NOTE> that emit a Light of their own; that &s;o by a Scrutiny of them we may
find out the Cau&s;e and Rea&s;on of Light.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e we have a va&s;t Number of all Bodies almo&s;t, by &s;ome means or
other affording us In&s;tances of this Luciferous Nature, but they may all be re|duced
to a few general Cla&s;&s;es or Heads, under which Cla&s;&s;es they may beea&s;i|ly
ranged in &s;ome re&s;pect or other.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t and Principal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Sulphureous Bodies, &amp;c.</NOTE> and the mo&s;t general of all the re&s;t, and which may
mo&s;t properly be &s;aid, of &s;uch Bodies as emit their own Light, or to produce
Light from them&s;elves, are all Sulphureous, Unctuous, Re&s;inous or Spirituous
Bodies, which will being fir&s;t heated, be burnt or Di&s;&s;olved by the Air, as a
<HI>Men&s;truum;</HI> for all &s;uch Bodies, whil&s;t they are thus Di&s;&s;olved or Burnt, emit a
con&s;iderable Light.</P>
<P>This Head therefore compri&s;es all combu&s;tible Bodies, which are either Mi|neral,
as <HI>Sulphur, Cole, A&s;phaltum, Bitumen, Petroleum,</HI> and the like; or Ve|getable;
<PB N="111" REF="145">
almo&s;t all Parts of which, except the Watry, are Combu&s;tible and Di|&s;&s;oluble
by the Air.</P>
<P>Or, Thirdly, Animal Sub&s;tances; all the Oily or Fatty$Parts of which are
likewi&s;e Combu&s;tible, but the Watery and Earthy Parts are not.</P>
<P>Now all the&s;e Sub&s;tances being fir&s;t heated to a certain Degree, &s;ome more,
&s;ome le&s;s, will by the Air be preyed upon and di&s;&s;olved, in which Action of
Di&s;&s;olution or Burning, Light is produced: And 'tis very evident that that Acti|on
is nece&s;&s;ary to the effect of Light, for that before the Con&s;umption or Di&s;&s;o|lution
begins, and after it is fini&s;hed, there is no Light produced, but only du|ring
the time of the Di&s;&s;olution. And this may be farther argued from this,
that the fa&s;ter and quicker the Di&s;&s;olution is made, the more &s;trong and vivid
is the Light; and the flower; the more weak and languid; and therefore, the
more of the <HI>Men&s;truum</HI> of the Air is applied to the Di&s;&s;olving Body, the more
quick is the Di&s;&s;olution performed, and the brighter is the Light, as is well
known in the blowing of Fire with Bellows, whereby a quick &s;upply of fre&s;h
Air, is brought to the burning Body, which is &s;ufficiently known to all Peo|ple,
though not under this Notion: Mo&s;t People &s;uppo&s;e it to be only for blow|ing
away the A&s;hes, and &s;o by that means &s;hewing or di&s;covering the Fire that
lies underneath them; but I have proved by divers Trials, that 'tis not the Mot|ion
of the Air by the Bellows, for removing the A&s;hes or driving off the burn|ing
Parts that does any thing in this Effect; becau&s;e if the Air that is &s;o blown
he fir&s;t &s;atiated and then blown on it, it produces no other effect than to blow
off the A&s;hes, and blow out the Fire; for the more you blow the more dead
is the Light, and the &s;ooner is the Fire quite extinct; in&s;omuch that in a very
&s;hort time the Coles all become perfectly Black, without emitting the lea&s;t
glimp&s;e of Light or Shining, at which time if one bla&s;t of fre&s;h Air be blown up|on
tho&s;e &s;eemingly dead extinct and black Coles, they all immediately begin
to Glow, Burn, and Shine afre&s;h, as if they had not been at all extinct; and
the more fre&s;h Air is blowed upon them, the more they &s;hine, and the &s;ooner
are they Burnt out and Con&s;umed. So that 'tis the fre&s;h Air that is the Life of
the Fire, and without a Con&s;tant &s;upply of that it will go out and Die.</P>
<P>Somewhat like this is ob&s;ervable in the Life of Animals, who live no longer
than they have a con&s;tant &s;upply of fre&s;h Air to breath, and, as it were,
blow the Fire of Life; for &s;o &s;oon as that &s;upply is wanting, the Fire goes out;
and the Animal dies, and all the other vital Functions cea&s;e; as any one may
pre&s;ently &s;ee, if he puts a &s;mall Animal as a Bird, or the like, into a &s;mall Gla&s;s
and covers it clo&s;e; for in a &s;hort time the Air becomes &s;atiated, and is no
longer fit for Re&s;piration; but though the Animal breath it as before, and Pant
and move his Lungs as before; yet if the Air be not fre&s;h, the Fire of Life will
extingui&s;h. Some Learned Philo&s;ophers and Phy&s;itians have been of the Opini|on,
that the u&s;e of Breathing was for nothing el&s;e, but that by the Motion of the
Lungs the Blood might be kept circulating which pa&s;t through them, or
that the Steams of the Blood might be carried off, which it could not do when
it was full of Steams; but by many Trials I have proved that neither of tho&s;e
are at all the Cau&s;e of the Death of the Creature, but only the w$nt of
fre&s;h Air.</P>
<P>For whether the Lungs move or not move, if fre&s;h Air be &s;upplied, the Ani|mal
lives, if it be wanting, it dies. Again, If the Air be full of Steams or not
full of Steams, it is all one, the Animal lives if it be fre&s;h, but if it be not, it
dies; nor does the heat or Cold of it do any thing. But this only by the by, be|ing
more proper to another Time and Di&s;cour&s;e; my pre&s;ent Inquiry being af|ter
the Nature and Cau&s;e of Light. This then is one of the Cla&s;&s;es of &s;hining
Bodies; namely, &s;uch as are Di&s;&s;oluble or Burnable by the Air.</P>
<P>The next Cla&s;s are all &s;uch Bodies as are not combu&s;tible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Shining B$|dies not Com|bu&s;tible, but heated</NOTE> but are &s;o fixt
as to indure a great degree of Heat, without being &s;ubject to flie away or be
di&s;per&s;ed into Vapours; &s;uch are all &s;orts of Metals, Stones, Earths, Clays,
Salts, Sands, White Burnt Bones, A&s;hes of Vegetable and Animal Sub&s;tances,
and the like; Every one of which when heated to a certain Degree of Heat, will
Shine or afford Light; but under a certain Degree will not &s;hine at all.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="146">
Now there are great Varieties of the&s;e Degrees, for that &s;ome will not begin to
&s;hine till, 'they have a very inten&s;e and violent Heat, others, with a &s;mall De|gree,
in&s;omuch that I lately &s;aw the Pouder of a Stone which laid upon a
Plate of Metal, and held over a Chafingdi&s;h of Coles, would pre&s;ently, and
with a &s;mall Heat begin to &s;hine, but &s;o &s;oon as the Plate cooled, would leave
off &s;hining, but the Plate being warmed again, it would again &s;hine; and al|mo&s;t
every Body has a peculiar Degree of Heat, at which it begins its &s;hining;
&s;o that there are almo&s;t as many Varieties of Degrees of Heat to make Bodies
&s;hine, as there are to make Bodies flow and melt; &s;ome will &s;hine before they
melt, as almo&s;t all the harder Bodies; as Gold, Silver, Copper, Bra&s;s, Iron,
Stones, Earths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> others will Melt before they Shine, as Tin, Lead, Salt peter,
Allum, Vitriol, Tallow, Gums, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the Third Cla&s;s are all &s;uch Bodies as &s;hine without Hear, by an inward
Fermentation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. Bodies &s;hining without Heat.</NOTE> in which though their Light be but &s;mall, yet does it become vi&s;i|ble

&s;o to do for a pretty-while, but will by degrees lo&s;e their Light, and be ex|tinct

<P>3. The&s;e &s;everal &s;orts of Lights are to be the Guides which mu&s;t conduct us
in our &s;earch after the true Nature of Light, nor can the Truth of the Theo|ry
be fully Di&s;cover'd, 'till every one of the&s;e Witne&s;&s;es and Te&s;timonies are
thoroughly examined, and that by comparing the Evidences that each of them
&s;hall bring di&s;tinctly, with tho&s;e of every one of the other, there being &s;uch Ax|ioms
and Maxims founded, as will open a way to the clear Knowledge of this
mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e and difficult Science of Light. From which as all the vi&s;ible Ap|pearances
derive their Original, &s;o the greate&s;t part of the Knowledge and
Information of Mankind; for the Explication of which, the Theory of Vi&s;ion,
and the &s;tructure of the Eye, the Organ of that Sen&s;e, and all the Powers and
Modifications and effects of the Rays of Light: And &s;o the Theory of <HI>Opticks,

Theory of Po&s;ition, Modification and Effect of the Rays of Light, whether Di|rect,
Refracted, or Reflected, of Compounded on the various Superficies on
which they are incident; every of which I de&s;ign (God Willing) fully to expli|cate.
So al&s;o the Velocity and Modification of all the Motions of the Cele&s;tial
Bodies?, <HI>viz.</HI> both the primary and &s;ecundary Planets, have their Original and
Cau&s;e, as I &s;hall hereafter plainly and fully demon&s;trate.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="147">
It would be too long here to recount to you the whole proce&s;s of the Exami|nation
of the&s;e Evidences, and the whole proceeding, with tho&s;e Evidences; by
comparing every one, with every other, &s;ingly; and then, many together, with
&s;uch a peculiar Number of many others; whereby the Nature and Cau&s;e, and
the Characteri&s;tick of Light in General is di&s;covered; and then, to di&s;cover
what is the peculiar cau&s;e of it in this, and that, and t'other particular Body,
from whence it proceeds. It will &s;uffice at this time to tell you the Re&s;ult and
Conclu&s;ion; for that the Proce&s;s is long and tedious, and not attained but by
many Steps and Degrees. <HI>Light then is nothing el&s;e but a peculiar Motion of
the parts of the Luminous Body,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Definition of Light, what it is.</NOTE> <HI>which does affect a fluid Body that incompa&s;&s;es the
Luminous Body, which is perfectly fkyud, and perfectly Dense, so as not to admit of
any farther Conden&s;ation; but that the Parts next the Luminous Body being mov|ed,
the whole Expan&s;um of that fluid is moved likewi&s;e.</HI> So that any a&s;&s;ignable
Parts next the Luminous body being protruded a certain a&s;&s;ignable Space, that
protrudes all the va&s;t <HI>Expan&s;um</HI> of the fluid, every way <HI>in orbem,</HI> at the &s;ame
In&s;tant an a&s;&s;ignable Space: So that no one Atom, or Point of it, to all ima|ginable
Di&s;tance, but is at the &s;ame time moved with it, or protruded for|ward:
For In&s;tance, When a Luminous Part of the Sun is moved with the
Motion of Light, it does at the &s;ame In&s;tant, move the Parts of the Incompa&s;|&s;ing
fluid, which is the proper <HI>Medium</HI> of Light, with the Motion of Light;
which part cannot &s;o be moved, but that all the Parts of that <HI>Medium,</HI>
to the extent of the World, mu&s;t be moved at the &s;ame In&s;tant, and protruded
from the Luminous Point in a direct Line; &s;o that at the &s;ame In&s;tant, that the
<HI>Apex</HI> of the Cone is moved, the &s;pherical ba&s;e of that Cone al&s;o is moved, and
every imaginary Spherical Superficies, that is parallel to that ba&s;e, is moved like|wi&s;e.</P>
<P>This Con&s;equence will follow of nece&s;&s;ity, from the Definition of the Nature
of the <HI>Medium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Medium of Light is perfe|ctly Dense.</NOTE> that is proper for the conveyance of Light. And that is, that
it is a <HI>Medium perfectly Den&s;e;</HI> that is, &s;uch as will not be by any Power forced
into le&s;s Dimen&s;ions than it is contained in, but does compleatly fill and main|tain
that &s;pace. And, Secondly, From its <HI>perfect fluidity,</HI> it does accommo|date
it &s;elf to all manner of Forms, &s;o as exactly to &s;hape it &s;elf into the new
Form that is given to it, by the Motion of Light.</P>
<P>For In&s;tance, If we imagine A B C to Repre&s;ent an hollow Conical Body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 5. Plate 1.</NOTE>
Indefinitely extended from the Point A, which is the Apex towards B C, and at
the &s;ame time imagine al&s;o this hollow Conical Body, fill'd with a Body per|fectly
fluid, and perfectly Den&s;e; that is, &s;uch as will perfectly accommodate
It &s;elf to the Figure of that Cone, and intirely fill the Cavity of it, &s;o as not to
leave the lea&s;t Point of it unfilled; and that will not admit of any manner of
Conden&s;ation into a le&s;s Room: If then we imagine, that by the fir&s;t &s;troke
of the Motion of Light, the Parts of the fluid that fill th Apex <HI>A d n,</HI> be dri|ven
forward toward the ba&s;e, into the &s;pace <HI>d n e o,</HI> equal to it in quantity;
it mu&s;t at the &s;ame In&s;tant drive that part of the fluid that fill'd the &s;pace <HI>d n e o,</HI>
into the &s;pace <HI>e o p f,</HI> equal to it in quantity, and that which fill'd the &s;pace
<HI>e o p f,</HI> mu&s;t at the &s;ame time be protruded into the &s;pace <HI>f p q g,</HI> of the &s;ame
quantity; and &s;o onward <HI>f p q g</HI> into <HI>g q r b,</HI> and <HI>g q r h</HI> into <HI>h r &s;i, in Infi|nitum,</HI>
or to the utmo&s;t extent of the Cone, and filling fluid Matter; &s;o that at
the &s;ame time that the Parts that made the imaginary Spherical Ba&s;e, <HI>d n,</HI> of
the Cone <HI>A d n</HI> are moved into the imaginary Spherical Ba&s;e <HI>e o,</HI> of the Cone
<HI>A e o,</HI> will the imaginary Spherical Superficies, <HI>l u,</HI> of the Cone <HI>A l u</HI> be mo|ved
into the Place of the imaginary Spherical Ba&s;e <HI>m x,</HI> of the Cone <HI>A m x,</HI>
though never &s;o far removed from the Apex <HI>A:</HI> So that a Body perfectly den&s;e,
and perfectly fluid, mu&s;t communicate &s;uch a Motion begun, to all imaginable
Di&s;tance in an In&s;tant. It being impo&s;&s;ible that the Apex of the Cone <HI>A d n</HI> can
be moved into the &s;pace <HI>d n o e,</HI> without moving at the &s;ame time, every part
of all the re&s;t of &s;uch a Cone, to the utmo&s;t Extension.</P>
<P>The further con&s;ideration then of this Cone, will give us the Rea&s;ons, and
Grounds of the three I have already named, and of &s;everal other Proprieties of
Light, and make them very intelligible and plain to be under&s;tood, and ea&s;y to
be demon&s;trated.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="148">
As,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;on of the Decrease of the Power of Light.</NOTE> Fir&s;t, From hence we may understand the Rea&s;on of the Force and Pow|er
of Light, at &s;everal Di&s;tances from the Luminous Body; for according to the
Increa&s;e of the imaginary Ba&s;es of the parts of the Cones, and according to the
Decrea&s;e of the Thickne&s;s of the &s;everal Parts; &s;o is the Decrea&s;e of the Power
of Light at tho&s;e &s;everal Di&s;tances. For, Fir&s;t, It is clear that the &s;ame Quan|tity
of Motion, and con&s;equently of Light, that there is is in the fir&s;t Cone or
Apex <HI>A d n,</HI> the &s;ame is there in the la&s;t part <HI>l u x m,</HI> and in every other inter|mediate
Part, as <HI>d n o e, e o p f, f p q g, g q r h,</HI> and the re&s;t; &s;o that if we
compute it first according to the Expan&s;ion of the Imaginary Ba&s;e; we &s;hall
find that tho&s;e increa&s;e in a Duplicate Proportion, that is, as the Squares of the
&s;everal Di&s;tances, as at ten times the Di&s;tance, the Expan&s;ion is a Hundred
times the &s;pace; and con&s;equently the &s;ame quantity of Motion is expanded
into a Hundred times the &s;pace, and therefore an equal &s;pace of the Superficies
of that, at ten times the Di&s;tance, will have but 1/100 Part of the Motion of Light
that is upon the Superficies at once the Di&s;tance. This therefore will be repre|&s;ented
by the Sections of a Conical Body, made by turning the Hyperbola
round upon the A&s;ymtot, for the Ordinates to the A&s;ymtot being in reciprocal
Proportion to the intercepted Parts of the A&s;ymptot, the Squares of Circles of
tho&s;e A&s;ymptots, mu&s;t be in Duplicate Proportion of the intercepted Parts of
the A&s;ymptot Reciprocally. This is the Proportion that the ingenious <HI>Kepler,</HI>
allows to the Decrea&s;e of Light, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be only in Duplicate Proporti|on
of the Di&s;tance Reciprocal; and according to this, he founds the Proportion
of the power of the Sun in moving the Planetary Bodies at &s;everal Di&s;tances;
but he ought to have con&s;idered al&s;o another Decrea&s;e of the Power of the
Light, according to the Decrea&s;e of Thickne&s;s, of the ba&s;e Parts of the Cone.
For &s;ince in all the Imaginary equal Parts of the Cones, there is the &s;ame
quantity of Matter, if the &s;ame be Expanded in Breadth, it mu&s;t be dimini&s;h|ed
in thickne&s;s. If therefore at ten Foot Di&s;tance, for In&s;tance, it be &s;pread
into a Breadth 100 times as big as at one foot di&s;tance, then con&s;equently to make
the equality of Content in the one and the other, there mu&s;t be but 1/100 part of the thickne&s;s.</P>
<P>For if at the Di&s;tances&mdash;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Superficies of Ba&s;es expanded be as&mdash;1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Thickne&s;s of tho&s;e Ba&s;es mu&s;t be as 1, &frac14;, 1/$, 1/16, 1/25, 1/36, 1/40, 1/66, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e then will give the Proportions of the length of the Pul&s;es or
&s;trokes of Light, at &s;everal di&s;tances from the Luminous Body, and con|&s;equently
the Velocity of tho&s;e Pul&s;es. So that according to the&s;e Rules, the
Force of Power of Light mu&s;t decrea&s;e in quadruplicate Proportion of the Di|&s;tances
reciprocally taken; that is, as the &s;quared Squares of the Di&s;tances
Reciprocally, and con&s;equently, as I &s;hall afterwards &s;hew the effect of Light,
of the Motion it cau&s;es in other Bodies, will be in Subduplicate Proportion of
the Powers, and therefore only in Duplicate Proportion of the Di&s;tances Reci|procally
taken.</P>
<P>So that thence it is evident, that Light does act according to the Proportion
of a Body moved, ob&s;erving exactly the &s;ame Proportions, and therefore can be
nothing el&s;e but that; for what Thing &s;oever hath all the &s;ame Proprieties with
another, mu&s;t be the &s;ame,</P>
<P>It is not therefore what the Learned and Ingenious <HI>Bulialdus</HI> would have it
to be;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bulialdus'<HI>s</HI> N$|tion rejected.</NOTE> namely, a certain Sub&s;tance which is a Geometrical <HI>Medium,</HI> between
a Body and a Spirit. <HI>Lux e&s;t</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>media Proportionalis inter corpoream
&s;ub&s;tantiam &amp; Incorpoream:</HI> Light is a middle proportional Sub&s;tance, between
a corporeal Sub&s;tance, and an incorporeal. A middle proportional (&s;ay he)
is that which between two extream Lines, does equally divide the Rationes of
both, and which does participate of the Exce&s;&s;es and Defects, and communi|cates
the &s;ame Habitudes with both; and by how many of its parts it is exceed|ed
by the Greater, by &s;o many parts of the Le&s;s does it exceed that. For In|&s;tance,
&s;ays he, Let <HI>A E</HI> be an incorporeal Sub&s;tance, and <HI>C</HI> a Corporeal. The
incorporeal Sub&s;tance <HI>A E,</HI> exceeds the corporeal Sub&s;tanced <HI>C,</HI> by the Exce&s;s
<PB N="115" REF="149">
<HI>D E,</HI> to wit, by in&s;tantaneous Motion and Penetration of &s;olid Bodies; but
the corporeal Sub&s;tance <HI>C,</HI> is defective of the Incorporeal by its Termination
and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Motion. Now we mu&s;t find a middle proportionate Sub&s;tance,
which is defective of the Incorporeal, and exceeds the Corporeal, but a middle
proportional does participate of the Exce&s;s and Defect. Now <HI>B G</HI> (the Sub|&s;tance
of Light) is defective of <HI>A E,</HI> in Termination and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Motion,
but it exceeds <HI>C</HI> in in&s;tantaneous Motion and Penetration. Now that Sub&s;tance
which is defective of one, and exceeds the other, is a Medium, but Light is
&s;uch a Sub&s;tance, which by its Penetration and in&s;tantaneous Motion, exceeds a
corporeal Sub&s;tance; but it is defective of Incorporeal Sub&s;tance, in its Termi|nation
and Succe&s;&s;ive Motion. This is his Demon&s;tration, but how much more
in&s;tructed we are by it, of the Nature of Light, I &s;hall leave to every Man to
judge. It is, I confe&s;s, above my reach to conceive what Sub&s;tance 'tis he
&s;hould mean; it being perfectly new and not thought of before, that ever I
could meet with; nor can I &s;ee what need he had of &s;uppo&s;ing any &s;uch Sub|&s;tance.
For &s;ince the &s;ame Proprieties that are found in Light are found in Cor|poreal
Sub&s;tances, or Bodies, as I have before mentioned; I &s;ee no rea&s;on why
on this Account, we have any Rea&s;on either to &s;uppo&s;e an Incorporeal Sub|&s;tance,
or a Sub&s;tance of a middle Nature, between Incorporeal and Corporeal.
'Tis to me, I confe&s;s, very difficult to conceive what a Corporeal Sub&s;tance is;
nor can I have any more clear Conception of what is meant by that Expre&s;&s;ion,
than what I would expre&s;s by the&s;e two Words; <HI>&s;omewhat extended,</HI> which
how that differs from a <HI>Vacuum,</HI> or an Exten&s;ion, without Sub&s;tance, or an
extended Nothing, is not ea&s;y to be under&s;tood by one that throughly con&s;iders
his own Conceptions.</P>
<P><HI>Des Cartes</HI> therefore makes Exten&s;ion and Body, or corporeal Sub&s;tance, to
be one and the &s;ame thing; and that no other Sub&s;tance but Body, or Corpore|al,
can be extended.</P>
<P>But to leave the&s;e Metaphy&s;ical Notions, 'tis clear from what I have &s;hewn,
that as to this Subject, Light, there is no need of &s;uppo&s;ing any other Sub|&s;tance,
but Corporeal, or Body; and that, &s;o and &s;o qualified; that is, perfect|ly
Fluid, and perfectly Den&s;e, and &s;o Receptive and Communicative, of all
manner of Motion.</P>
<P>As to the Notion therefore of the Sub&s;tance of Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The true Moti|on of Light.</NOTE> I know not what can
be farther added, that is more known or more Intelligible than that it is; Fir&s;t,
A Sub&s;tance, or a &s;omething; that is infinitely fluid, or at lea&s;t, indefinitely;
if that be more conceivable, who&s;e lea&s;t conceivable Part is free from cohe&s;ion
with any other, and &s;o is &s;u&s;ceptible of any kind of Motion, without carrying
or moving along with it the Lateral Bodies, whereby it only communicates the
Motion it receives behind, to the Parts that lie immediately before it; whence
follows that great Propriety of Light, that in a uniform Medium, it propagates
its Motion every way in direct Lines or Rays, from a Center of a Sphere.</P>
<P>And, Secondly, That it is a Sub&s;tance,, or &s;omething that compleatly fills an
Exten&s;ion or Quantity every way extended, and cannot be conden&s;ed, or forced
into le&s;s Exten&s;ion, Space, or Room, by any Natural Power; but that the
&s;ame Sub&s;tance will always have the &s;ame Quantity, or Exten&s;ion, one
way or other; what it wants in one, it will have in one or both of the other Di|men&s;ions;
as what it wants in breadth it will have in thickne&s;s, or in length,
that &s;hall recompence the whole, and bring it to equality.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That this, as all other Bodies, is &s;u&s;ceptive and communicative of all
manner of Motion, but is more appropriated to Motion of &s;uch a Degree of
Swiftne&s;s, which is in proportion to the Motion of other Bodies, who&s;e lea&s;t
part is &s;olid and bulky, as the bigne&s;s of the one, to the bigne&s;s of the other,
Reciprocally taken. This may &s;erve for the Explication of the Sub&s;tance of Light.</P>
<P>4. The next thing we are to con&s;ider, is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Motion of Light.</NOTE> the Motion of Light, which is the
principal thing considerable in it; for the Sub&s;tance without the Motion has no
effect, nor has the &s;ub&s;tance Light; 'tis that we are &s;en&s;ible of, and not of the
Sub&s;tance; &s;o that be the Sub&s;tance what it will, whether Corporeal, or Incor|corporeal,
<PB N="116" REF="150">
corporeal, or Middle, Proportional, or None; provided we know what the
Motion is, and the Rules, Powers, and Proportions of that, we need not much
con&s;ider the Sub&s;tance of it.</P>
<P>In the Con&s;ideration then of Motion the&s;e thing are ob&s;ervable;</P>
<P>1. The Quantity.</P>
<P>2. The Quality.</P>
<P>3. The Power.</P>
<P>By the quantity of Motion, I under&s;tand only the Degrees of Velocity ex|i&s;tent
in a certain Quantity of Matter.</P>
<P>By the Qualities of Motion, I mean the Modifications of it in Body, as
whether it be Simple or Compound, Reflected, Refracted, Direct or Oblique,
and the like.</P>
<P>By the Power, I mean the Act or Effect it produces upon other Bodies, in
agitating or moving them.</P>
<P>In the Con&s;ideration of every one of which, I &s;hall indeavour to reduce the
Theory to Calculation and Mathematical Exactne&s;s; without which, all other
ways are but Random Gue&s;&s;es, and make no certain and demon&s;trative Conclu|&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Motion produced by the Lucid Particles must be of a certain Degree of
Swiftne&s;s; otherwi&s;e, it is not propagated in the form of Light, for 'tis not
every Motion that produces that Effect; for 'tis in Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sound how cau&s;ed.</NOTE> as it is in Sound;
that the Motion mu&s;t be of a certain De|gree
of Swiftne&s;s, before Motion will
be propagated in the Medium that conveys it: we find that moving a Stick in
the Air, if we move it but &s;lowly, we hear no Sound; becau&s;e the Motion is &s;o
&s;low, that the Parts of the Air that were before it do ea&s;ily move round the
Sides of the Stick and come behind it, &s;o that only tho&s;e Parts of the Air are
moved that lie near the Stick, which do only receive &s;uch a circulating Motion
as brings them from before to come behind, the ambient Parts of the Air ha|ving
Power enough to reflect and keep in that Motion, &s;o as only to circulate
about the Stick; but if the Motion of the Stick be &s;o &s;wi&s;t, as that the Particles
before it over power the Re&s;i&s;tance of the ambient Air, &s;o that its Motion is
not reflexed backwards, but propagated directly forward into the Air, then Sound
is generated and propagated from the Stick, every way <HI>in orbem;</HI> whence if you
give a very quick Motion to the Stick in the Air, you pre&s;ently hear a
Noi&s;e.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A certain De|gree of Heat produces Light.</NOTE> if you take a piece of the mo&s;t fixed Body that will in|dure
the Fire; as for In&s;tance, a piece of pure Gold, or refined Silver, which
will not wa&s;t nor burn by heating; if you heat it but with a &s;maller Degree of
Heat, you will not perceive it to &s;hine or give any kind of Light; but if you
continue to Augment the Heat to a certain Degree it will begin to &s;hine, and
appear Red Hot, as we call it; and if it be heat more, it &s;hines brighter; but
if you take it from the Fire, and permit it to cool, its Light grows fainter and
fainter, and when it is come to a certain Degree of Heat, it cea&s;es to &s;hine at
all, and emits no Light. Now Heat, as I &s;hall afterward prove, is nothing
but the internal Motion of the Particles of Body; and the hotter a Body is,
the more violently are the Particles moved, and with a quick Motion; but the
Particles of Bodies, according as they are more bulky and clo&s;e, &s;o do they re|quire
the greater Degrees of Motion, to make them move with an equal Degree
of Motion, with that of &s;maller Particles; as I &s;hall afterwards prove, when I
come to give the Laws and Rules of Motion propagated from Body to Body.
In the &s;ame manner in &s;uch Diamants, as will &s;hine like a Gloworm in the Dark,
(for all Diamants will not; but I have &s;een and tryed many Diamants that
would;) the Stone will not begin to &s;hine 'till it has received a certain Degree
of rubbing and Agitation, but beyond that Degree, the more you rub it the
more it &s;hines, and any little &s;troke upon it with the Nail of ones Finger, when
it &s;o &s;hines, will make it &s;eem to fla&s;h. The like I have lately ob&s;erved in
the Pho&s;porus of <HI>Kunkell,</HI> that the rubbing it a little with ones Finger, does
make it glow, and as it were flame. So if you take a Piece of Cold Iron, and
<PB N="117" REF="151">
hammer it on an Anvil, you mu&s;t continue hammering it very &s;trong and quick
a go$d a while, before you will perceive it to begin to &s;hine; but if you continue
to work it with a Hammer for a certain &s;pace, it will &s;hine very briskly; and
grow, as we call it, Red Hot. Now in all the&s;e In&s;tances, and a Hundred
more I could produce, 'tis evident that there mu&s;t be a certain Degree of Ham|mering,
Rubbing, or Heating, before the Body &s;o wrought on will produce
Light: All which do effect an internal Motion of the parts of the bodies &s;o
Hammered, Rubbed, or Heated; 'tis therefore evident, that 'tis not every Mo|tion
of the Particles of Bodies that will produce Light, but a certain Degree of
it; under which no Light is produced, and beyond which the Light is increa&s;ed
and augmented.</P>
<P>This kind of internal Motion therefore in the Parts of the Body, is that
which produces Light; what&s;oever therefore produces this Motion, produces
Light; whether it be heat, as i$ all very fixt Bodys, or Fire, which, as I told
you before, is a Di&s;&s;olution of the Body by the Air, as in all Unctuous, Re|&s;inous,
or Sulphureous Bodies; or Hammering and Strokes, as in Stones, Chry|&s;tals,
Diamants, Sugar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or Fermentation and Corruption, as in Fi&s;h,
Glow-worms, Rotten-Wood; or the Motion of Light it &s;elf, as in the Bononi|an-Stone,
and Dr. <HI>Baldwin</HI>'s Pho&s;phoros, and in almo&s;t all other Bodies held in
the Focus of a Burning Gla&s;s. Light therefore in the Object, is a peculiar kind
of Internal Motion of the Particles.</P>
<P>The propagation of this Motion into,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Light is in the Me$$|um.</NOTE> and through the incompa&s;&s;ing Medi|um
is that we call Light in the Medium, or the &s;pace between the Inlightning
and Inlightned Body. This propagation of Motion, as I &s;aid before, is every
way <HI>in orbem;</HI> and it may be cau&s;ed either by an Immediate pul&s;e of the Parti|cles
of the Body again&s;t the Parts of the incompa&s;&s;ing Fluid, as a Stone &s;triking
again&s;t the Water, from whence the Waves of Motion are there propagated
In Rings; or el&s;e by the extru&s;ion of the Part of the Fluid Medium of Light
that lies between the &s;olid Particles of the &s;hining Body; as Water &s;queezed
out of a Spunge into Water, or Water forced out of a Syringe, or Pipe, into
Water, which will produce the &s;ame Rings in the Surface of the Water. It
&s;eems to be in &s;ome Ca&s;es One way, and in &s;ome Ca&s;es the other. In burning
Bodies, it &s;eems to be the fir&s;t way, where every Particle of the Body Di&s;&s;ol|ved
flies a&s;under, and is rarifi$d or di&s;per&s;ed into a bigger &s;pace, in the manner
as we may ob&s;erve in the firing of a Grain of Gunpouder, which we &s;ee ex|pands
into a Sphere of Flame, which extrudes and evacuates a Sphere of Air
round about the fired Grain. But in hammered Bodies, and &s;ome other I have
named, it &s;eems to be the other.</P>
<P>If we therefore con&s;ider what Effects follow in the&s;e &s;en&s;ible Examples,
we may the more certainly conclude what mu&s;t follow in the more in|&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>The Grain of Gunpouder, then, when it is fired, rarifies it &s;elf into a Sphere
near a Hundred times as big in Diameter, or one Million times as big in Bu$$;
this extrudes all the Air that was contained in that Sphere into a Space or Oro
without it, and incompa&s;&s;ing it, large enough to contain it; and con&s;equently
mu&s;t remove the Air that fill'd that &s;pace into another &s;pace without that, and
that the next, and &s;o onward &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to a certain Di&s;tance; 'till at La&s;t the
Medium of the Air being a Springy, Rarified, or Yielding Medium, and not a
Den&s;e and Unyielding Medium, the Motion is at length lo&s;t, and &s;o this sound
audible but to a certain Di&s;tance. Whereas in the propagation of Light, the
<HI>Medium</HI> being perfectly Den&s;e and Unyielding, that Propagation is continued
<HI>in Infinitum,</HI> or to the utmo&s;t extent of the <HI>Medium.</HI> The &s;olidity therefore of
the incompa&s;&s;ing Spheres, will be to one another as 1, 2, 3, 4, <HI>&amp;c&punc;</HI> in Arithme|metical
Progre&s;&s;ion; and con&s;equently the Diameters of tho&s;e Spheres will be as
&radic; c 1. &radic; c 2. &radic; c 3. &radic; c 4. and &s;o onwards; and con&s;equently if you take the
Diameters of the contained, from the Diameters of the containing, the Remain|ders
will be the thickne&s;s of the containing &s;hell; that is, the &radic; c $. will be the
length of the &s;troke of the Pul&s;e of Light in the fir&s;t &s;p$ce; &radic; $ 2.&mdash;&radic; c 1. the
<PB N="118" REF="152">
length of the &s;troke of that Pul&s;e in the &s;econd &s;pace; &radic; c 3.&mdash;&radic; c 2. the length
of the &s;troke in the third; &radic; c4.&mdash;&radic; c 3. in the fourth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o that tho&s;e in|definitely
continued, will be very near to a Series of Numbers in the &s;ame Pro|portion,
with the &s;uperficies of the Spheres reciprocally taken, and con&s;equent|ly
the length of the &s;troke of the Pul&s;e of Light, will be in duplicate Proportion
to the di&s;tance reciprocal.</P>
<P>I have been the more particular in the Explication of this Power of Light,
becau&s;e, as I &s;hall afterwards prove to you, this is the Power of Cele&s;tial Bo|dies
by which they Act upon, and attract each other; and by which all the
Primary Planets that move about the Sun are regulated in Velocities, Di&s;tan|ces
and Motions, whether circular or Oval. As al&s;o all the &s;ecundary Planets, as
the Moon about the Earth, and the Satellites about <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Jupiter,</HI> make
their Periods. And from the true &s;tating of this Power, and the Effects of it
on Bodies at &s;everal Di&s;tances, all the Theory of A&s;tronomy will be deduced a
<HI>Priori,</HI> with $eometrical Certainty and Exactne&s;s; and con&s;equently the Ta|bles
and Numbers will be ea&s;ily adapted, which will tend to the Perfection of
that Noble Science.</P>

the chief of which is, that Effect it has on the Eye; to which End he

<HI>i. e.</HI> that according to the length of the Stroak or Pul&s;e, &s;o is the
Power or Strength of Light. Effects of Burning Gla&s;&s;es explained and
applied to this purpo&s;e; that the length of the Pul&s;e at the <HI>Focus</HI> there|of
is the &s;ame with the length of the Pul&s;e at the Sun. 3. The Action
of the Eye much the &s;ame with that of a Burning-Gla&s;s; &s;o that the im|pre&s;&s;ion
on the <HI>Retina</HI> is the &s;ame, as if the Action of the Object were
really there. 4. Why the Eye is not hurt by the Object, tho' it, as it
were, feels and touches it: And this is, becau&s;e it takes in, the <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> but
of a very &s;mall <HI>Cone</HI> of <HI>Rays</HI> from the radiating Sphere; &s;o that tho'
the Velocity or length of the Pul&s;e be the &s;ame, yet there being but few,
their collected Power is le&s;s; and this is perform'd by the Contraction
of the <HI>Pupilla;</HI> whence the Eye becomes weakned by bright Objects, and
why we can look on the Sun thro' a very &s;mall Hole. 5. The Fabrick
of the Eye and all its parts, as far as relates to Opticks, examined,
and is nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ent De&s;ign; the more particular Examinati|on
of the parts, and its Humours, being refer'd to the Nature of Re|ftraction.

of Vi&s;ion. The De&s;cription and u&s;e of a Per&s;pective Box, in&s;tead
of a dark Room, which will explicate all the <HI>Phenomena</HI> of Vi&s;ion as
they are repre&s;ented in the bottom of the Eye. An Explication of Shadows
or the defect of Light. <HI>R. W.</HI></Q>
<P>I Have in &s;ome of my former Lectures in this place, explained to you the
Nature and Proprieties of Light; and &s;hew'd to you what it is in the Lu|minous
Body from whence it proceeds, and what it is in the Medium, through
which it is propagated: I &s;hew'd you how it came to be propagated every
way <HI>in Orbem,</HI> to all imaginable di&s;tance in an In&s;tant, and with what pro|portion
of Strength it was &s;o propagated to all a&s;&s;ignable Di&s;tances from the
Lucid Object; and thence I deduced with what Power it operated, and there|by
produced Effects on tho&s;e Subjects, on which it was impre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="154">
The fir&s;t and Principal of all the Operations it hath on Subjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Effect Light has on the Eye.</NOTE> is that effect
which it hath upon the Organ of the &s;eeing Eye, wherein it maketh &s;uch an
Impre&s;&s;ion as becomes &s;en&s;ible to the Animal Faculty. This then is the next
thing I &s;hall indeavour to explain; namely, the Action or Effect of Light upon
the Eye.</P>
<P>For the doing of which, I &s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider the Fabrick and Make of that
Organ. Secondly, The manner how Light comes to operate upon it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Explicati|on of the Eye.</NOTE> For the Fabrick of the Eye, It is in it &s;elf &s;o truly admirable, that
there is nothing in the whole Creation better de&s;erves our Contemplation, and
wherein the Wi&s;dom and De&s;ign of the Great Creator more &s;en&s;ibly appears;
for as of all created Beings, tho&s;e which are animated &s;eem to have the great|e&s;t
Contrivance; every thing in each of them &s;eeming to be contrived on pur|po&s;e,
and with a De&s;ign, re&s;pecting the end of their being and well-being, and
continuation either in the individual, or in the Species propagated. So among
tho&s;e animated Bodies, Animals &s;eem to abound with more excellent contri|vances
than Plants; and of Animals &s;ome are yet more curious and perfect
than &s;ome others; that is, have more Contrivance and Perfection of Organi&s;a|tion
and Mechani&s;m than others; though every thing in its kind be furni&s;h'd
with tho&s;e Faculties which are requi&s;ite to perform tho&s;e Functions which are
nece&s;&s;ary to their Pre&s;ervation. Now of all the Organi&s;ations of Animals, none
are more admirable than tho&s;e of the Sen&s;es, and of tho&s;e, none, that we know,
more wonderful than that of Sight, wherein we &s;hall find every thing &s;o adapt|ed
for Matter, Form, Situation, Motion, and the like:, that it does far exceed
the Contrivance of the Wit of Man to come near it, even in Imitation. And
yet we find that all things are Con&s;onant and Congruous to our Understanding,
and we cannot chu&s;e but approve and admire the great Wi&s;dom and Contri|vance
of the Maker, &s;o that we may even from thence clearly and demon&s;tra|tively
&s;ee, that the Rea&s;on of Man is a &s;park of the Divine Influence, and that
whatever is done in this World is adequate to the Principles and $word$ of
Rea&s;on implanted in our Under&s;tanding and Knowledge; and that all $word$
are formed and act with De&s;ign and Re&s;pect to the End, and not fortuitou&s;ly
and by chance.</P>
<P>For an In&s;tance of this, we cannot in Nature pitch upon a better than the
Fabrick of the Eye, in which we &s;hall find every thing adapted and formed for
that particular part of performing Vi&s;ion, which is to be performed by it;
and every part has its nece&s;&s;ity to make up the perfect Effect, and no one is re|dundant,
and there is no part defective.</P>
<P>The Radiations of Light I have formerly Explained, are continually Propa|gated
from every Luminous Object, and from every Point of every Luminous
Object, every way from every one of tho&s;e Points <HI>in Orbem;</HI> as the Rays from
a Sphere: So that as there are infinite of tho&s;e radiating Points in the World,
&s;o from every one of tho&s;e infinite Points there are infinite of tho&s;e Radiations;
&s;o that the Luminous <HI>Medium</HI> has infinite Radiations in every Point thereof;
to wit, a &s;ingle Radiation from every one of tho&s;e infinite Radiating Points.
Now the&s;e Radiating Points are not only all &s;uch as &s;end out their own Light
which is generated in them&s;elves, but all &s;uch likewi&s;e, as by Reflection or Re|fraction,
are the Cau&s;es of reflecting or di&s;per&s;ing the Light, received from
other Luminous Bodies. Now the Eye is an Organ or In&s;trument by which all
tho&s;e infinite Rays that are thus jumbled and blended together, and &s;o might
be thought impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;eparated, are &s;o curiou&s;ly &s;ifted, culled, &s;epara|ted,
and parted from each other, that they are all again made di&s;tinct, and eve|ry
one of them appropriated, as it were, to is di&s;tinct Point or Cell. So that as
there are infinite of tho&s;e Radiating Points without the Eye that $mit tho&s;e
Beams; &s;o there are infinite of tho&s;e receptive Points within the Eye that re|ceive
them, each of which Points do only receive the Radiations from one of
tho&s;e infinite Points without, and from no other what&s;oever at the &s;ame time.
Now it is not only a Separation of the&s;e Rays thus pa&s;&s;ing in one &s;ingle Point
<PB N="121" REF="155">
only of the Luminous Medium, for that would &s;eem to be more ea&s;y, but it is
a Separation of all tho&s;e infinitely infinite Rays that pa&s;s through the infinite
Points that are in a Superficies as big as the Pupil, or Black Hole of the Eye,
and a Reunion of all tho&s;e radiations that come from any one Point, into one
Point again; &s;o that the Eye may not improperly be called a Microco&s;m, or a
little World; it having a di&s;tinct Point within it &s;elf, for every di&s;tinct Point
without it &s;elf in the Univer&s;e; and when a Hemi&s;phere of the Heavens is open
to its view, it has a Hemi&s;phere within it &s;elf, wherein there are as many Re|&s;pective
Points for Reception of the Radiations, as there are differing Points for
emi&s;&s;ion of Radiations, and all tho&s;e infinitely infinite Radiations, which pro|ceed
from that whole Hemi&s;phere of the Univer&s;e, and pa&s;s through the <HI>Area</HI> of
the Superficies of the Pupil of the Eye, are by this truly wonderful Contrivance
of the Eye, &s;eparated from each other, and conveyed to the di&s;tinct cells of the
Microco&s;m of the Eye. For the exact and curious Performance of which
Work, the Fabrick of the Eye is &s;o curiou&s;ly contrived, that 'tis beyond the
Wit of Man to imagine any thing could have been more compleat. Nay, It
could never have entred into the Imagination, or thought of Man to conceive,
how &s;uch a Sen&s;ation as Vi&s;ion could be performed, had not the all Wi&s;e Con|triver
of the World endued him with the Faculty and Organ of &s;eeing it &s;elf.
How could it have entred into the Imagination of Man to conceive, how it &s;hould
be po&s;&s;ible for &s;uch an Atom of the Univer&s;e as Man is, to be informed at the
In&s;tant that a thing is done, how and where it is done, though Million of Mil|lions
of Miles di&s;tant? Certainly no more than we can now imagine how it
&s;hould be po&s;&s;ible for any Man here in <HI>London</HI> to know the particular Thoughts
and Inclinations of any one &s;ingle Man in <HI>China</HI> or <HI>Japan,</HI> or of all the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI>
or <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> together, at the &s;ame In&s;tant they are thought there.</P>
<P>Now the contrivance of the Eye is not more admirable for its Power of &s;epa|rating
differing Rays from differing Points, one from another, than it is for con|gregating
and culling all the infinite Rays that come from one Point, and Re|uniting
them again into one Point; for by this, principally, is Vi&s;ion made.
This is that which makes the Rays produce &s;o powerful an Effect as to be &s;en|$ible
to the Animal. Now this will appear more plain if we con&s;ider the Ex|plication
I have formerly given of the Cau&s;e of Light in the <HI>Medium,</HI> and the
manner of its in&s;tantaneous Progre&s;&s;ion through it. This I &s;hew'd you was a
Motion or Pul&s;e cau&s;ed by the Protru&s;ion of the Bodies about the Center, a
certain &s;pace every way in <HI>Orbem,</HI> towards the Circumference. Now though
the length of this Pul&s;e at the Luminous Body, as the Sun, from the Center out|wards,
&s;hould be an Inch perhaps; yet &s;ince the length of that Pul&s;e doth de|crea&s;e
continually in duplicate Proportion of the Di&s;tance, reciprocally taken
from the Luminous Body; the length of the Pul&s;e of Light here with us would
not be the 1000000 Part of the thickne&s;s of a Hair; now what can we imagine
or conceive could be &s;o curiou&s;ly &s;en&s;ible as to be moved thereby, or that the
animated Body, or any part of it, could be &s;en&s;ible of it, or affected by it?
certainly it could not, and therefore the all Wi&s;e Creator contrived the Eye to
be an Organ to re&s;tore again the Strength of that Pul&s;e, which was de&s;troyed by
the great interpo&s;ed Di&s;tance; for by the means hereof, the Pul&s;e that was, by
di&s;tance, &s;hortned Million of Millions of times of the length it had at the Lu|minous
Points; is by the reunion of them by the Eye again, re&s;tored to a good
part of its fir&s;t Power, in the corre&s;ponding Point in the Eye: for as, whil&s;t
Rays are diverging and &s;preading from the Luminous Point into a uniform <HI>Me|dium,</HI>
the Pul&s;e grows &s;horter and &s;horter in a duplicate Proportion to the Di|&s;tance
reciprocally; &s;o in converging Rays (or Rays drawn to a Point, from a
Superficies) do the lengths of the Pul&s;es increa&s;e in a contrary order: So that
in probability, in the Point of Reunion in the Eye, the Pul&s;e may be almo&s;t as
long, as at the Point of Emi&s;&s;ion or Emanation. That this may be the better
under&s;tood, I would di&s;cour&s;e a little upon a very common and obvious Expe|riment
of &s;etting Fire to a Body by the Rays of the Sun, collected by a Burn|ing
Gla&s;s, whether Reflecting or Refracting, it matters not much to our pre&s;ent Rea&s;oning.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="156">
Suppo&s;e then we have a Burning Gla&s;s of a Foot Diameter, or breadth;
which will collect all the Rays from the Sun, and unite them at fourteen Inches
from the Gla&s;s, into a Focus or circular Figure of the Sun of &frac18; of an Inch in
Diameter, we &s;ee fir&s;t by Experiment, that the Rays &s;o collected will &s;et Fire
to Wood, and &s;everal other Combu&s;tible Bodies and con&s;ume them, whereas
the Rays of the Sun before this Union of them, were very hardly, perhaps, if
at all &s;en&s;ibly warm. If therefore we con&s;ider the Rea&s;on of this Effect, we
&s;hall find that all the Rays which were before expanded into a Circle of a Foot
Diameter, are, by this Con&s;tipation made by the burning Gla&s;s, crowded and
thru&s;t together into the &s;pace of a Circle &frac12; of an Inch in Diameter; we mu&s;t
conclude that all that warmth that was in the Circle of a Foot Diameter, is
now in a Circle of half a quarter of an Inch. Now the Area of the greater
Being, to the Area of the le&s;s, as 9216 to one, it follows that the Heat of the
greater to the Heat of the le&s;s, mu&s;t be Reciprocal to the Area, that is, as 1 to
9216, and con&s;equently the impre&s;&s;ion of the Light at the <HI>Focus,</HI> mu&s;t be more
than at the Gla&s;s, no le&s;s than 9216 times; and con&s;equently the &s;ame as the
dire&s;t Rays of Light from the Sun would be, at one 96th part of the Di&s;tance
of the Earth from the Sun; and con&s;equently as &s;trong as it would be upon a
Planet about the Sun, which &s;hould appear to us at the Di&s;tance from the Sun
of 36 Minutes, or a little more than the Diameter of the Sun. Now in the
&s;ame manner as this Burning Gla&s;s acts upon the Rays of the Sun in con&s;tipating
and driving them together into a &s;maller room, does the Eye for all other
Rays of Light from Luminous Objects. Where that Impre&s;&s;ion or Action of
the Light, though In it $word$ be very &s;mall, and wholly in&s;en&s;ible even to
that part of the Eye, which is the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and curious of all the Parts off
the Body, namely, the <HI>tunica Retina,</HI> as &s;hall afterwards &s;hew, yet is made
&s;en&s;ible by the Multiplication of its Force upon the Con&s;tipation of the Rays
into a <HI>Focus,</HI> which Acts and Terminates in that mo&s;t curious Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>This is one way by which we may conceive &s;omewhat of the Rea&s;on of
the curious Fabrick of the Eye for the Multiplication of the Action or Power
of Luminous Bodies, upon the &s;en&s;ible Animal Part.</P>
<P>2. The other way we may conceive how this Fabrick of the Eye does cau&s;e this
Impre&s;&s;ion to be Multiplied,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Eye Multiplies the Power of Light.</NOTE> Augmented, and become &s;en&s;ible, Depends upon
the con&s;ideration of the Hypothe&s;is, which I propounded the la&s;t Term for the
explanation of Light, and that was by a Pul&s;e or Stroke, according to the
length of which, I &s;hewed you at that time, the Power or Strength of the
Light was.</P>
<P>This I explain'd to you by a &s;en&s;ible Experiment made by firing Gunpowder.
For a Corn or Grain of Gunpowder expanding it &s;elf, when fired in a Sphere
1000000 as big as its own Bulk, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily act accordingly on the en|compa&s;&s;ing
Medium; but I need not repeat what was then &s;aid. Therefore to
return to the In&s;tance of the Burning Gla&s;s.</P>
<P>Now by the Refraction or Reflection of a Burning Gla&s;s, all tho&s;e Rays which
before were Diverging and &s;preading wider and wider from a Point, and &s;o grew
weaker and weaker in the proportion I mentioned (that is, according to the
Superficies of the Sphere, or Ba&s;is of the Cone) by this Action I &s;ay of the
Burning Gla&s;s, they are made converging and approaching nearer and nearer to
gether; and &s;o of con&s;equence augmented and increa&s;ed in Power and Effect,
and the Strength lo&s;t or rarified by the diverging, is renewed and revived by the
converging. And whereas in the diverging, the Diminution was very &s;low and
long, in this converging, the Increa&s;e and Augmentation is very quick and
&s;hort; for as the di&s;tance of the Burning Gla&s;s from the Sun, is to the di&s;tance
of the Burning Gla&s;s from its Focus; &s;o is the Increa&s;e of Con&s;tipation,
by the effects of that Burning Gla&s;s upon the Rays, to the decrea&s;e of Expan|&s;ion
of them in their Progre&s;s from the Sun to the Gla&s;s; &s;o that the Rays of
Light at half the Di&s;tance of the <HI>Focus</HI> from the Burning Gla&s;s, is the &s;ame
with the con&s;tipation of the Rays, at half the di&s;tance of the Sun from the
Burning Gla&s;s, and con&s;equently the length of the Pul&s;e, and &s;trength of the
Ray is the &s;ame; and &s;o at a tenth Part of the di&s;tance from the Focus, the
<PB N="123" REF="157">
Power or Action of Light, is as &s;trong as it is at a tenth part of the Di&s;tance of
the Sun from the Burning Gla&s;s. So that if the di&s;tance of the Sun be 10000
Semidiameters of the Earth, and the Focus 14 Inches; the &s;trength of the Light,
or the length of its Pul&s;e or Stroke &s;hall be the &s;ame at 1&frac25; Inch from the Focus,
that It is, at 1000 Diameters Di&s;tance from the Sun; and con&s;equently, the
length of the Pul&s;e in the very <HI>Focus,</HI> mu&s;t be the very &s;ame with the length of
the Pul&s;e at the Sun.</P>
<P>3. Now the Action of the Eye being much the &s;ame upon the Rays of Light,
from any Luminous Object with this of the Burning Gla&s;s; it follows that the
Eye does by its Power bring all vi&s;ible Obje&s;ts into the bottom of it, and make
an Impre&s;&s;ion on the <HI>Retina,</HI> the &s;ame, as if the very Action of the Object were
immediately there.</P>
<P>3. So that the Sub&s;tance of the <HI>Retina</HI> is affected or moved by the very &s;ame
Action,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The&s;e applied to the Eye.</NOTE> as if it touched the Object; and the Eye does continually make the
Hemisphere of Actions or Motions within it &s;elf, the &s;ame with the great vi&s;ible
Hemi&s;phere without it. And the&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions are communicated to the Brain,
or &s;en&s;ated by the Animal Soul, if that Sub&s;tance be in Health and Sound; if
not, the Impre&s;&s;on is Defective, and the Sight or Sen&s;ation Imperfect. As it
&s;ometimes happens in &s;ome Di&s;tempers of the Brain and nervous Parts, in
which Ca&s;es the &s;ight fails, though the Organ of the Eye it &s;elf be perfectly
formed, as in a <HI>Gutta Serena.</HI></P>
<P>There is a very remarkable ob&s;ervation of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mariotte</HI> about Vi&s;ion, that
the &s;en&s;ation Light is not made in the <HI>Tunica Retina,</HI> but on the <HI>Choroeides;</HI>
That that part of the bottom of the Eye which the <HI>Choroeides</HI> does not cover
is wholly &s;en&s;ele&s;s and blind, though the Impre&s;&s;ion of Light upon the Place be
the &s;ame as on the Parts that are contiguous, and lie about it.</P>
<P>Now this Gentlemans Ob&s;ervation is, that that part of the Eye, where the
Optick Nerve enters into The Cavity of it, which is not in the Axis of its Figure,
but at a pretty di&s;tance from it nearer to the No&s;e, namely, at about 25 Degrees
from the Axis in ward, is not cover'd with the <HI>Choroeides.</HI> And that we have no
&s;en&s;e of the Impre&s;&s;ion of Light made upon it.</P>
<P>The Experiment is this, take two &s;mall Candles in the Night, or in the Day
time, two &s;mall bits of White Paper of about the bigne&s;s of a $word$ let the
Candles be &s;et on a Table at two or three Foot di&s;tance, &s;o that the Flames
may be about the height of the Eye from the Floor; let the Papers in the Day
time be &s;tuck again&s;t a dark Wall, or dark coloured Hangings, at about the
&s;ame di&s;tance, and the &s;ame height; then placing your &s;elf just before them,
and looking towards them, clo&s;e one of your Eyes with your Hand; as &s;uppo&s;e
your left Eve, and look directly on the Candle or Paper on your left Hand,
and you will &s;ee both the Objects very plain, that you re&s;pect, very clear and
di&s;tinct, and the other &s;omewhat more Imperfectly; keeping your Eye thus
&s;hut, and the right Eye re&s;pecting the left Hand Object, by Degrees go back|wards,
'till at length you will perceive that the Right Hand Object vani&s;hes,
and is no more vi&s;ible; mark that Di&s;tance and you will find it to be at about
3&frac14; times the Di&s;tance of the two Objects, going yet farther backward, you will
again begin to &s;ee them both as before, <HI>viz.</HI> at the di&s;tance of about 4&frac12;; then
again going in this Po&s;ture nearer the Objects, you will find the Right Hand
Object di&s;appear when you come to the former Di&s;tance, and when nearer,
they will both again appear, and &s;o continue 'till you come clo&s;e to them.
Now the rea&s;on of this Appearance is, that the Axis of the Right Eye being al|ways
kept directed to the Left Hand Object, when you are at the afore&s;aid Di|&s;tance,
the impre&s;&s;ion from the Right Hand Object falls on that part of the
bottom of the Eye where the Optick Nerve is in&s;erted, over which there is no
part of the <HI>Choroeides</HI> expanded, and the &s;en&s;ible part being wanting, the Sen|&s;ation
is not made, though the Impre&s;&s;ion be the very &s;ame; as on each &s;ide of
it, as I &s;hall prove more particularly, when I come to explain the &s;everal parts
of this mo&s;t curious Organ and what the Function and U&s;e of each part is,
which I may make the Subject of &s;ome of my &s;ucceeding Lectures.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="158">
This Deduction of his was di&s;approved by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pequet,</HI> tho' the Experi|ment

<P>4. I have endeavoured to explain to you that admirable contrivance of the
Organ of Sight, the Eye, whereby it Collects the Rays of Light, &s;o as to make
an Impre&s;&s;ion upon the &s;en&s;itive Part of it, of the Action, Motion, or Power
of the Luminous Object upon the immediately incompa&s;&s;ing <HI>Medium,</HI> though
this Luminous Object be never &s;o far di&s;tant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Eye is not hurt by the Action of Light.</NOTE> and by that means, as it were in
an in&s;tant, to touch, or feel any &s;uch Object, as if it were contiguous to it, but
yet &s;o as not to hurt or offend the &s;en&s;ible part; for the Eye taketh but a very
&s;mall Cone, or part of the Radiating Sphere; and thereby, though the Motion
be the &s;ame as to Velocity and Length of Pul&s;e in every the &s;malle&s;t Cone or
Ray, that it is in the whole Sphere; yet being but a &s;mall part of the whole
incompa&s;&s;ing <HI>Medium,</HI> it contains but a part of the Action of the Luminous
Point; for which Rea&s;on we are able to look upon the Sun, or a Fire, or an
exceeding bright Flame; as melted Silver, or Iron, or Sulphur burning upon
melted Niter, without much offending the Organ, if it be &s;trong and vegete;
but if the Eye be weak, and the Impre&s;&s;ion be continued, it will much offend
it, and dull the Sen&s;e, whence it is that looking much upon Fire, or any &s;uch
bright Object, does very much decay the Sight, and makes it more in&s;en&s;ible of
the weaker Impre&s;&s;ions made by other le&s;s Luminous Objects: And hence we find,
that we are unable for a time to perceive Objects in a Hou&s;e or Room, imme|diately
after we come in out of the Sun&s;hine. Now by rea&s;on of the great Va|riety
that there is in differing Objects, as to the Quantity and Strength, and
that the <HI>Retina,</HI> or &s;en&s;ating part is capable only of receiving Impre&s;&s;ions to a
certain Degree of Strength, without being hurt by it, there is a contrivance in
the Eye, which I &s;hall afterwards more fully explain, by which the Quantity
of the Rays admitted is moderated, &s;o as to keep it, that the impre&s;&s;ion does
not exceed that limit: And this is the Aperture or Hole through the <HI>Iris,</HI> which
is the black Hole that appears in the middle of the tran&s;parent part of the
Eye; for this Hole which admits the Rays to pa&s;s into the Eye, is contracted
or dilated, according as the Object is brighter or darker; that a le&s;&s;er Quanti|ty
of the &s;tronger Rays, and a greater Quantity of the weaker Rays may be ad|mitted,
and hence it is, that a brighter Object among dimmer Objects, does
cloud and darken them, becau&s;e the aperture of the <HI>Iris</HI> being contracted pro|tionable
to the Strength of the brighter, the Rays, admitted from the faint|er
and more dim Objects, are not &s;ufficient to make a &s;en&s;ible Impre&s;&s;ion. So
that the effect of the Rays are by this means proportion'd to the Ability of the
&s;en&s;ible Part of the Eye to bear the Impre&s;&s;ion, and where notwith&s;tanding the
utmo&s;t contraction of this aperture of the <HI>Iris,</HI> the Rays make too &s;trong an
impre&s;&s;ion upon the <HI>Retina,</HI> we are forc'd to wink and clo&s;e the Eye$Lids nearer,
to &s;hut out part of that quantity of Light which would otherwi&s;e have entred
into the Eye; or to look through a &s;mall Hole, or through an opacous Body.
And hence it is, that any one may with ea&s;e look upon the Sun, if he look
through a &s;mall Pin hole in a Plate, by which means one may with plea&s;ure &s;ee
an Eclip&s;e of the Sun, without using any opacous Gla&s;s; though if the <HI>Cornea,</HI>
or any other part of the Eye, be any ways opacous, this way di&s;covers the De|fects
of them, and does &s;omewhat vitiate the Figure of the Object. But of
this, and the manner of contracting of the Pupil, more, when I come to explain
that part, of the Eye; that which I mention it for at present is, only to explain
how the Eye becomes it were a Hand, by which the Brain feels, arid touches
the Objects, by creating a Motion in in <HI>Retina,</HI> the &s;ame, and at the same In|&s;tant,
with the Motion of the lucid Object it &s;elf. For the make of the Eye
is such, in all its Contrivance and Parts, that the Conical Ray of Light pro|ceeding
from a Point of the Object, and terminating with a Divergency in the
Aperture, or <HI>Cornea</HI> of the Eye; is by the Refraction thereof again reunited in|to
a Point at the <HI>Focus,</HI> which is in the <HI>Retina;</HI> and con&s;equently, whatever the
Motion or Power of the Light was in the <HI>Apex</HI> of the Cone, which is at the
<PB N="125" REF="159">
Luminous Body the &s;ame is the Motion or Power of Light; at the Point or
<HI>Apex</HI> of the Cone, made by the Refraction, and terminating in the <HI>Retina,</HI> &s;o
that the Eye does, as it were, invert and &s;horten the conical Radiation, and con|tracts
a Cone 10000 Semidiameters of the Earth in length, into the length of
an Inch or thereabout in a Man; from which Explication all the Appearances
of Vi&s;ion, whether by the naked Eye, or by Tele&s;copes, or Micro&s;copes, will
be very naturally, and I conceive very truly explained; and the wonderful Wi&s;|dom
of the Great Creator more manife&s;tly &s;hewn.</P>
<P>5. We are therefore in the next place to con&s;ider the Fabrick of the Organ
it &s;elf, of what Parts it con&s;i&s;ts, and of what u&s;e each of them is toward the
compleating this Effect.</P>
<P>1. In the Con&s;ideration whereof, the fir&s;t thing that represents it &s;elf to our
View, is the tran&s;parent part of it that is placed outwards, which is the en|trance
by which the Rays pa&s;s into it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not need to mention the po&s;ition of it in the Face, nor the Duality of
them, nor the Cells of the Skull in which they lie, nor the Lidds that cover it
when Sen&s;ation cea&s;es, as in Sleep; &s;ave only that I &s;hall afterwards &s;hew you
the u&s;e of them for moy&s;tning, glazing, and clearing the <HI>Cornea</HI> from Du&s;t and
other Fowlne&s;s; no nor of the various Mu&s;cles that &s;erve to Rule it to and fro every
way, and direct and fix the <HI>Axis</HI> of it upon the Object to be viewed; the
contrivance of which is truly admirable, nor &s;hall I take notice of any Anato|mical
Ob&s;erva$ion concerning it, &s;ave only &s;uch as tend to explain the Make
and Fabrick of it, for performing this Effect of Collecting Diverging and pa|rallel
Rays, and refracting them into a Point or <HI>Focus:</HI> Other considerations
thereof being more proper to be handled upon the con&s;ideration of other
Subjects.</P>
<P>Having taken the Eye out of its place, or Socket in the Skull, and having ta|ken
off carefully all the Mu&s;cles that &s;erve for its Motion, as being not now
considered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 1. Fig. 6.</NOTE> we have a round Ball &s;haped &s;omewhat like that repre&s;ented in
the fixt Figure <HI>A B E B F A.</HI> This Body is in a Man of about an Inch Diame|ter,
and to <HI>B A B,</HI> is very near of a globous Figure, though in divers other
Animals it be of divers other Figures; &s;ome of them more depre&s;t at the middle,
and nearer to the &s;hape of a Turnip, and at about 25 Degrees from an imagin|ed
Axis, which pa&s;&s;es through the middle of all its parts, is in&s;erted into it
the Optick Nerve <HI>F F,</HI> which In&s;ertion together with all the Globous part of
the Ball, is covered with a thick, &s;trong, and pretty &s;riff Coat, or Shell,
which &s;erves as a &s;olid Wall, to pre&s;erve the &s;hape and figure of the Parts within,
to which al&s;o the Mu&s;cles, for its outward Motions, are fa&s;tned; and like|wi&s;e
the Mu&s;cular Parts within the Eye, which &s;erve for the inward Motions;
this is called the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; or <HI>Tunica Sclerotica,</HI> or hard Coat; and is a conti|nuation
of the <HI>Dura Mater,</HI> or the outmo&s;t &s;trong hard Bag that contains the
Brain; and by a curious Di&s;&s;ection may be found quadruplicate, as is al&s;o the
<HI>Cornea.</HI> This for the mo&s;t part is white and opacous, and &s;o permits no light
to pa&s;s it any way, though in &s;ome Creatures I have ob&s;erved it to be pretty
Tran&s;parent, &s;o as to &s;hew the Picture of Objects without, made at the bottom
of the Eye, as in Young Kitlings: The formo&s;t part of this is of a more pro|tuberant
Figure, and &s;eems &s;omewhat Elliptical; ri&s;ing con&s;picuou&s;ly promi|nent
above the Superficies of the Sphere <HI>B A B,</HI> continued this Prominent part
<HI>B E B,</HI> is perfectly tran&s;parent, though it be of a flexible Sub&s;tance, and from
&s;ome kind of Re&s;emblance it has to Horn, is called the <HI>Cornea,</HI> or horny Coat:
This, as it is more round in the middle about E, than it is at the fide <HI>B B,</HI> &s;o I
have ob&s;erved it al&s;o to be thinner in the middle, than at the &s;ides; &s;o that it
re&s;embles the de&s;cription in the Figure. The Ellipticalne&s;s of the Figure, as it
may plainly be di&s;covered by the Eye, without any other help, &s;o more certain|ly
by the Reflection of Images from its Surface, and by the refraction of it
when filled with Water, and looked through toward any near Object. Through
this tran&s;parent Coat or <HI>Cornea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fabrick of the Eye.</NOTE> the Rays enter into the Eye, and receive their

of the Eye. This is much larger in &s;ome Animals, as in Cats, Owls, Leo|pards,
and other Creatures that &s;eek their Prey in the Night; and &s;o is able to
receive a greater Quantity of tho&s;e faint and dim Rays di&s;per&s;ed from Objects
at that time, in which Creatures al&s;o the Pupil of the Eye is capable of a much
greater Expan&s;ion and Contraction, as I Shall by and by ob&s;erve. This may
give a very good hint of the po&s;&s;ibility and practicablene&s;s of &s;eeing in the
Dark, of which I have many Years &s;ince made divers tryals with very good
Succe&s;s; and I have known &s;everal Men who have had &s;uch a Con&s;titution of
their Eyes by Nature, that they would be able with Ea&s;e to &s;ee every Letter
di&s;tinct, when other Men, that otherwi&s;e had very good Eyes, could not &s;ee the
Lines.</P>
<P>The in&s;ide of this thick and hard coat of the Eye, is covered with another
Coat, being in various Eyes of various Colours, as Black, Blue, Brown, Green,
Yellow, and the like; it covers al&s;o the Optick Nerve, and is joyn'd to the
<HI>Sclerotica,</HI> by an infinite company of little Veins, and Arteries and Ve&s;&s;els;
this immediately joyns to, and, as it were, lines the In&s;ides of the hard outward
Coat, &s;o far as the vitreous Humour extends; namely, to <HI>B B,</HI> and is called
the <HI>Choroeides.</HI> But above this place it is &s;eparated from it in the aqueous Hu|mour,
and is called the <HI>Uvea.</HI> The u&s;e of this, as to Opticks, &s;eems to be for
the imbibing of the Rays of Light after they have impre&s;t their Motion upon
the <HI>Retina,</HI> though I have ob&s;erved in &s;ome Creatures, a &s;trong reflection from
the bottom of the Eye, which could be from no other than the <HI>Choroeides.</HI>
What its U&s;e is for conveying nece&s;&s;ary &s;upply and Nouri&s;hment to the Parts of
the Eye, is not my Subject.</P>
<P>To the in&s;ide of this Coat is joyned the <HI>Retina,</HI> which is that which im|mediately
covers the vitreous Humour, and is the &s;ame Sub&s;tance with the
Sub&s;tance of the Brain, which is al&s;o the <HI>Medulla</HI> Marrow, or Pith of the
Optick Nerve. This by <HI>Des Cartes</HI> and mo&s;t others, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;en|&s;ible
part of the Eye, which receives the impre&s;&s;ion of the Pencils of the Rays
of Light; though there are others of another Opinion, that the <HI>Retina</HI> being
the &s;ame with the &s;ub&s;tance of the Brain, has no &s;en&s;e in it, as the Brain it &s;elf
hath not, but that the <HI>Choroeides,</HI> as being the &s;ame with the <HI>Pia Mater,</HI> and
con&s;equently of the mo&s;t acute Sen&s;e, is that which receives, and is &s;en&s;ible of
the Impre&s;&s;ion of the Rays of Light: And to confirm this, the Experiment I
&s;hew'd and explain'd to you the la&s;t day is brought as an Argument by Mon&s;ieur
<HI>Mariotte,</HI> which carries in it indeed very much of probability; for by that Ex|periment
you have a &s;en&s;ible Proof, that in that part of the Eye where there is
no part of the <HI>Choroeides,</HI> as at the <HI>Medulla</HI> of the Optick Nerve, there you
are blind as it were, or in&s;en&s;ible of the Light; whereas in that Place there is
the greate&s;t Plenty of the <HI>Retina</HI> or <HI>Medullary</HI> Part; within this Coat is con|tained
the Vitreous or Gla&s;&s;y Humour of the Eye which fills the whole lower
Cavity of it; it is called the Gla&s;&s;y Humour, not that 'tis &s;o very hard; but
becau&s;e it being very tran&s;parent and clear, it is of a greater conssitence than the
watery, being like a Jelly, and yet is &s;ofter than that which from its exceeding
clearne&s;s, not hardne&s;s, is called the <HI>Chry&s;talline;</HI> this is delineated by the Fi|gure
<HI>G G.</HI> This Humour on the upper &s;ide of it has a Cavity in it, where it
receives the <HI>Chry&s;talline</HI> Humour, which is &s;omewhat of the Figure delineated by
<HI>I H:</HI> the under part of which in a Man, and in mo&s;t other Terre&s;tial Ani|mals,
is much more convex than the uppermo&s;t which is more flat; but in
mo&s;t Fi&s;hes it is of a perfect Globular form; its of a pretty &s;olid Con&s;istence
&s;o as to keep its Form after it is &s;tript of the Coat or Skin, that covers it both
above and below, called the <HI>Aranea</HI> or Cobweb Coat, which is very thin,
&s;trong and tran&s;parent, and is joyn'd to the <HI>Choroeides</HI> by the Edges, by means
of the <HI>Ciliares B H, B H,</HI> which &s;eems to be Mu&s;cular, all the &s;pace between
the Cry&s;talline Humour and the Cornea is filled with a very clear and liquid
Water, the Figure of which Cavity, and con&s;equently of the Water contained
is expre&s;t by <HI>I I,</HI> contain'd within the Cavity <HI>E B H B E.</HI></P>
<P>In this Water between the Chry&s;talline and the Cornea, is placed a Skin with
a Perforation in the middle of it, that is called the <HI>Uvea,</HI> expre&s;t by <HI>B I, B I,</HI>

Animals is of &s;everal &s;hapes, but in Men it is perfectly round, in Sheep of an
Oblong Oval, in Cats like a &s;lit; in other Creatures of other Forms, the big|ne&s;s
of which is more or le&s;s, according to the brightne&s;s or dimne&s;s, the near|ne&s;s
or remotene&s;s of the Objects &s;een, and has in it a kind of natural Motion
not voluntary, which is moved only by the various Impre&s;&s;ions of the Objects.
And we have no other Power to open it than by looking upon dark Objects, or
of &s;hutting it, than by looking upon bright and near Objects: The Limits of
which Motion in Men is not very great, but in Cats and other Creature, that
&s;ee in the Dark, very great.</P>
<P>This Watery Humour does &s;ometimes breed a kind of Mother in it, &s;o as to
become thick, and look White, and &s;o hinder the Rays of Light in part, or in
whole, from pa&s;&s;ing through it, and when it is grown to a &s;en&s;ible Thickne&s;s,
is call'd a <HI>Cataract,</HI> but the Sight may be again recovered by couching that <HI>Ca|taract,</HI>
which is nothing but thru&s;ting in a fine Needle through the <HI>Cornea,</HI> and
with the Point of it breaking and cru&s;hing down to the bottom of the Eye this
Mothery Sub&s;tance. This Humour, though it be all let out, will pre&s;ently be
renewed again, and filled with Water as before, without de&s;troying the Sight
of the Eye, as has been often experimented.</P>
<P>Thus I have &s;hewed you all the parts of which the Eye con&s;i&s;ts, and the form
and manner of their Po&s;ition in order to compleat this curious Organ to make it
fit for Vi&s;ion; having omitted all tho&s;e other con&s;iderations of it, which belong
more properly to Anatomy and Phy&s;ick, my aim being only to take notice of
tho&s;e things only &s;erve for the explication of Opticks and Light.</P>
<P>It would be too long for this pre&s;ent Exerci&s;e to explain to you the exact Fi|gure,
and the various Refractions of the &s;everal parts of the Eye, and to &s;hew
you the particular u&s;e of every part of it, for compleating the collection of Rays
proceeding from the Points of the Luminous Object, and terminating them in as
many di&s;tinct Points at the bottom of the Eye, which I de&s;ign, God willing, to
compleat, when I come to explain Refraction and the Laws thereof. And
therefore, I &s;hall at pre&s;ent only mention to you, that that Collection $span$
is made at the <HI>Retina</HI> or <HI>Choroeides,</HI> which, as I have &s;hew'd, you are the
Coats that line the bottom of the Eye, and encompa&s;s the vitreous H$mour on
which they do de&s;cribe, as it were, a perfect Picture, or Repre&s;entation of all
outward Objects, as may be plainly &s;een by the Eye of a Kitling; <HI>the Sclero|tis</HI>
or bottom of which is tran&s;parent, or by any other Eye, if the <HI>Sclerotis</HI> be
carefully &s;haved off &s;o as to leave it tran&s;parent: And as I have done by a large
artificial Eye made with Gla&s;s, Water, and Jelly, figured according to the
&s;hapes repre&s;ented in the Scheme, which is a Section of the Eye, made by the
Optick <HI>Axis;</HI> that in this Picture are remarkable not only all the Lines and
Proportions, but the Lights, Shadows, Colours, Motions of the Objects them|&s;elves.
So that from a clear Under&s;tanding of this, the Rea&s;on, Cau&s;e, and
Manner of Vi&s;ion will be clearly under&s;tood.</P>
<P>5. Now becau&s;e the Structure and Making of &s;uch an Artificial Eye is very
difficult, and the u&s;e thereof notwith&s;tanding, very nece&s;&s;ary for a through
Knowledge of Opticks, I having only mention'd this at pre&s;enr, that &s;uch as
have a Mind to be curious in it, may, if they plea&s;e, prepare the like.</P>
<P>I &s;hall rather as a Supplement to it, make u&s;e of a darkned Room, or Per|&s;pective
Box, in which all the Appearances that are made in the Eye are in
&s;ome manner repre&s;ented.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 1. Fig. 7.</NOTE> Prepare therefore a Box of the &s;hape in the &s;eventh
Figure, let it be four or five Foot long from <HI>A</HI> to <HI>D E,</HI> and make the $span$
of it <HI>B C,</HI> Concave towards the End A, and the bottom of the Box <HI>B D E C</HI>
being made Cylindrical, and not Tapering, as the part <HI>A F G</HI> is, that the mov$ble
bottom <HI>B C,</HI> may be placed nearer to or farther from the End <HI>A.</HI> And A place a
Convex Gla&s;s of the length of the Box in a Hole as large as the Gla&s;s, which
the larger it is the better, becau&s;e of &s;everal Tryals that may be made with it,
which cannot be made with a &s;maller. To this Hole cut &s;everal, as eight or
ten Pieces of Pa&s;t-board that may each of them &s;erve to cover it, and in every
of them cut a Hole of a Round, or other Figure you would u&s;e, and either $n

the middle of it, or out of the middle of it, and of a greater or le&s;s Figure, ac|cording
to the Tryals you de&s;ign by them; let the in&s;ide of the Concave bot|tom
be made very White, to receive and reflect, the Points of Light, and make
a Hole in the &s;ide of the Box <HI>H,</HI> covered about with Leather, or thick Wollen
Cloth, with a Hole large enough to put ones Face into it, &s;o as to &s;ee the Spe|cies
or Picture of outward Objects upon the bottom, then turning the end <HI>A</HI>
where the Gla&s;s is placed toward the Object (if the Sun &s;hines upon it, it is
the better, becau&s;e of the great Reflection of Light from &s;uch Objects,) &s;lide the
moveable bottom <HI>B C,</HI> to or fro, 'till by looking in at the Hole <HI>H,</HI> you perceive
the Repre&s;entation of the outward Objects very perfect, then take notice of the
di&s;tance of the Object, and likewi&s;e the di&s;tance of the bottom; the Po&s;ition,
Magnitude, Brightne&s;s, Colour, and all the other Remarks that appertain to
the explaining the &s;everal Appearances that may happen to the Eye, then fit it
for repre&s;enting Objects at a greater di&s;tance, and take notice of the di&s;tance of
the bottom, and all the other Remarks nece&s;&s;ary for explaining your Inquiry:
The like may be done with&punc; the various apertures of Pa&s;tboards, which may
&s;erve to explain all that might happen to the Eye, by the contracting and dila|ting
the Pupil, by ob&s;erving the definedne&s;s of the Species on each &s;ide the <HI>Ax|is,</HI>
and where they are mo&s;t di&s;tinct; and &s;o for all other Que&s;tions that may
happen concerning what Light is in the Eye, and what Effects it there produces.
It may be convenient to fix a Ball and Socket underneath it to make it more ea|&s;y
to be managed. It may al&s;o be made &s;quare as well as Cilindrical, provided
the bottom of ir, <HI>B C,</HI> be a Concave of a part of a Sphere of the length of the
BoxesRadius.</P>
<P>Let this therefore &s;uffice at pre&s;ent for explication of the fir&s;t Principle of the
Emanation of Light from the Luminous Body, and for the Reception therof up|on
the &s;ubject; that the Light is conveyed from every Point of the Luminous
Body, to every Point of the Body inlightned, through a uniform tran&s;perent
Medium by direct Emanations, or in imaginary &s;traight Lines. The &s;ame Rule
holds in all Light that proceeds from an Object inlightned, that promi&s;cuou&s;ly
reflects the Light ca&s;t upon it every way, for &s;uch a Body may be &s;aid to &s;hine,
as it were, by the Light of another Body, and may therefore upon that account
be &s;aid to be a &s;ecundary Luminous Body, and the Light a &s;ecundary Light,
&s;uch as that of the Moon, and the other Primary and Secundary Planets, &s;o
that the &s;ame Rule will hold in both, and the inlightning and the inlightned
Cones are to be con&s;idered in the calculation of Rays from Bodies &s;hining by a
&s;ecundary Light, and the Proprieties and Proportions to be ob&s;erved in both, in
their Power and Propagation, will fall under the &s;ame Rules as I &s;hall after|wards
more at large explain and manife&s;t.</P>
<P>Next, As light is thus propagated by imaginary &s;traight Lines, &s;o is al&s;o
Shadow, which is nothing but a Defect or want of a peculiar Light, taken off
or intercepted by an opacous Body, or of a Body that will nor permit the Rays
to pa&s;s onwards in its direct Cour&s;e, which is only vi&s;ible by Accident; that is,
by finding from that part a defect of the Influence of Light, which we are &s;en|&s;ible
of, every where about it. And by this means it is that we &s;ee the dark or
&s;haded &s;ide of the Moon in an Eclip&s;e of the Sun; that is, we perceive &s;uch a
part of the light of the Sun taken off by the opake Body of the Moon coming
between that and us, but of it &s;elf it is no ways vi&s;ible; for though we may be
&s;aid to &s;ee that &s;haded part of it which hides part of the Sun, yet we cannot &s;ee
any part of it which is without the Suns Limb, &s;o were the Body of the Moon
in an Eclip&s;e of the Moon, pe$$ctly within the &s;hadow of the Earth, and that
no manner of Light by the refraction of the Sun-beams in the Atmo&s;phere were
conveyed to it, we &s;hould &s;ee no other appearance of it, but only that &s;ome|times
this, &s;ometimes that Star would di&s;appear which was covered by it, and
it is only di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Light about it.</P>
<P>This therefore comes under con&s;ideration only relatively with re&s;pect to Light,
and is to be calculated as a Defect, though the &s;ame Rules in calculation of the
two before mentioned Cones will here held al&s;o, but as Defects or like Quan|tities
in Algebra marked with a Minus.</P>

&s;hort. Mr. <HI>Hobb</HI>'s Expedient of a <HI>Conatus ad Motum</HI> in&s;ufficient.
That there mu&s;t be an actual local Motion, and that able to break the
mo&s;t &s;olid Bodies. What Light is in the Agent, <HI>Medium,</HI> and Patient,
is explain'd by a familiar Example: All Motions local, and differ only in
the lengths of Spaces, and Moments of Time. 3. How Light is in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly
propagated <HI>in Orbem,</HI> evinced by a cogent Example, by which
all the Proprieties of its Motion are clearly explained. Two different Cones
may be con&s;idered between the illuminating and illuminated Bodies. Why
the Light of the Sun exceeds that of all the Stars collected, if the Stars were
brought nearer, tho' their <HI>Areas</HI> remain'd the &s;ame, yet their Light would
be greater. 4. The Proprieties of Light propagated in a tran&s;parent uni|form
<HI>Medium</HI> to the Eye, reduced to four Con&s;iderations, each of which
are enlarged upon and exemplified. How the &s;ame Corpu&s;cle may commu|nicate
different Motions &s;everal different Ways, in the &s;pace of a Human
Moment, 5. Every &s;en&s;ible Moment of Time, as well as every &s;en&s;ible
Particle of Matter compo&s;ed of infinite le&s;&s;er; &s;o that in the &s;ame &s;en&s;ible
Moment, the &s;ame &s;en&s;ible Point may be &s;ucce&s;&s;ively moved infinite Ways,
when the Vibrations of a &s;tring can be no longer di&s;cerned, they become
the Objects of another Sen&s;e, the Hearing; the &s;en&s;ible Moments of Crea|tures
proportioned to their Bulk. Short lived Creatures may have as ma|ny
&s;en&s;ible Moments as longer lived, and in &s;ome Sen&s;e be &s;aid to live as
long as Man. That there are infinite Spaces in the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible Space to
be moved; and la&s;tly, the Velocities may be infinitely &s;wift in each of
the&s;e Spaces. The bigger the Body is, the &s;lower are its Vibrations. Le&s;|&s;er
Animals &s;ee tho&s;e Vibrations which we can only hear. A Continuati|on
of that Subject of the Propagation of Light. That the va&s;t Number of
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive Impul&s;es in a Human Moment is no Objection; &s;o that upon the
whole, there may be a&s;&s;igned to the Propagation of Light, a real local
Motion. 6. From the former Rea&s;ons, the Author deduces the Cau&s;e of
the perfect fluidity of the va&s;t <HI>Expan&s;um</HI> of Matter or <HI>Aether,</HI> between
<PB N="130" REF="167">
the Planetary Bodies. Why one fluid Body hinders Motion thro' $word$ more
than another, in&s;tanced by &s;ome Experiments. <HI>R. W.</HI></Q>
<P>I have formerly explain'd here &s;everal Properties of Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Light the Me|dium to convey all Cele&s;tial knowledge.</NOTE> which I have been
the more particular in, becau&s;e it is the <HI>Medium,</HI> by which all the Knowledge
we have of the Heavenly Bodies is conveigh'd to us&punc; for though we are affected
also by the Hear, yet it &s;eems to be conveyed to us by no other Medium than
that of Light; for Light, as I have &s;hew'd you, &s;eems to be nothing el&s;e but
an Internal Motion of a Tran&s;parent, fir&s;t begun&punc; or impo&s;ed by the Luminious
Body, upon the Parts of the Uniform, or Tran&s;parent <HI>Medium;</HI> and then propa|gated
through that <HI>Medium,</HI> to the utmo&s;t Extent, or Limits of it. Now
from the boundle&s;&s;ne&s;s of its Propagation, and the In&s;tantaneou&s;ne&s;&s; al&s;o of it,
I conceive that the Parts thereof are ab&s;olutely Contiguous, and make a <HI>Plenum;</HI>
&s;o that at the &s;ame In&s;tant that a part is moved by the Lucid Body, at any one
part of the <HI>Medium,</HI> the utmo&s;t Extreams of the <HI>Medium,</HI> on that $ide towards
which the Motion is impre&s;&s;ed, are moved al&s;o. And this agrees with the mo&s;t
curious Ob&s;ervations that have been hitherto made concerning it; and though
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Romer</HI> indeavours to make it otherways by Ob&s;ervations made about
the <HI>Satellites</HI> of <HI>Jupier;</HI> yet, as I have formerly &s;hew'd you, they are not &s;ufficient
to prove his Theory; becau&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ing his Ob&s;ervations and Calculations ex|act,
yet there may be other as probable Cau&s;es a&s;&s;igned to &s;olve the Appearances,
as this which he has a&s;&s;igned. So then if the Propagation be in&s;tantaneous, it
will follow, I &s;ay, that the <HI>Medium</HI> is perfectly Den&s;e, or the Parts immedi|ately
contiguous one to another; for if there &s;hould be Vacuities inter&s;per&s;ed,
and &s;o the Parts behind &s;hould be nece&s;&s;itated to move through that Space, before
it could touch the next, and that another &s;pace, before it could touch the third,
and that third another Space to pa&s;s, before it could touch a fourth, and &s;o on|wards;
it would follow, that the pa&s;&s;ing of every one of the&s;e Spaces would
take up &s;ome time, and con&s;equently would make the Motion temporaneous
but where the Parts are immediately contiguous, the fir&s;t cannot move without,
at the &s;ame In&s;tant, moving the &s;econd, nor that without moving the third,
nor that without moving a fourth, fifth, &s;ixth, and &s;o forward, to an innume|rable
Series, or to the utmo&s;t extent of the Medium. The ingenious <HI>De&s;cartes.,</HI>
therefore, compares it to a &s;olid Rod or Stick, who&s;e Parts being all contigu|ous,
the one End cannot be thru&s;t forward, but that at the &s;ame In&s;tant, the
other end is al&s;o thru&s;t forwards, which is a plain and very &s;en&s;ible Explication
of what is meant by In&s;tantaneous Propagation in the <HI>Medium, viz.</HI> a moving
together of all the Parts of the <HI>Medium,</HI> and not a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>2. Now though the Propagation be thus in&s;tantaneous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ Impre&s;&s;ion on the Medium m$mentary.</NOTE> yet the Impre&s;&s;ion of
this Motion on the <HI>Medium</HI> is Momentary, and though it be never &s;o &s;hort a
Motion, and never &s;o quick, yet it mu&s;t be temporary; for if the moving Lu|minous
Body does move, or remove the <HI>Medium</HI> before it; it mu&s;t remove it
&s;ome &s;pace, and that Space cannot be pa&s;ted without &s;ome time; and therefore,
I conclude, that every Stroke, or Pul&s;e of Light is Momentary, and la&s;ts for
&s;ome &s;pace 'till a &s;econd Pul&s;e or Stroke is impre&s;&s;ed, though the Duration
of each Pul&s;e be never &s;o &s;hort; as &s;uppo&s;e, but the thou&s;and thou&s;andth part
of a Second of time, yet a Thou&s;and Thou&s;and of &s;uch Pul&s;es will make a Second
of Time, and though the &s;pace that it moves be but the thou&s;andth Part of
a Hairs Breadth, yet even that is a Space, and has a <HI>terminus a quo,</HI> and a <HI>termi|nus
ad quem,</HI> and an interjacent &s;pace, through which the Motion mu&s;t be
performed in &s;uch a Space of time.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hobbs</HI>'s Expe|dient in&s;uffici|ent.</NOTE> Nor will the Expedient which Mr. <HI>Hobbs</HI>
has found out, to &s;ave a Local Motion, &s;erve the turn; for he would have it to
be nothing but a <HI>conatus ad motum,</HI> an Endeavour to move, and not a Real Mo|tion,
and <HI>De&s;cartes&punc;</HI> would have it a Propen&s;ion to Motion, and not a Motion;
but what the one means by <HI>Conatus,</HI> and the other by Propen&s;ion, if it be not
an actual Motion, I under&s;tand not; but as I &s;hall hereafter prove, it mu&s;t be an
actual <HI>Loco</HI>-Motion, for the Experiments I &s;hall bring for that purpo&s;e, will
manife&s;t it to the Sen&s;e to be a Local Motion, and that very con&s;iderable too,
in as much as it is able to break in Pieces even the mo&s;t &s;olid Body in the
<PB N="131" REF="168">
World.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A familiar Ex|ample to ex|plain the&s;e matters.</NOTE> Now when I &s;ee a Ma&s;on holding the Edge of a Steel Chizzel hard
again&s;t a very &s;olid Marble Stone, with his Left Hand, and with his Right,
&s;tricking upon the Top, or Head of that Chizzel, with an Iron Hammer, &s;o as
to break off a piece of the Stone, I cannot but conclude that that Chizzel mu&s;t
have had more than a <HI>Conatus ad Motum,</HI> to make the Marble break, and that
there was a real-Local Motion of the whole Chizzel together forwards, &s;o far
as the Edge thereof did penetrate the Marble before it brake it. And this, I
hope, may &s;erve as a &s;en&s;ible Similitude, by which I would inform the Under|&s;tanding
what kind of Action or Motion it is, by which Light is fir&s;t generated
in the Luminous Body: namely, like the Motion of the Hammer again&s;t the
Head of the Chizzel; next, how it is propagated through the tran&s;parent <HI>Me|dium,
viz.</HI> the Medium is all moved together, even as the Body of the Chiz|zel:
And, Thirdly, How that acts upon the Subject inlightned, and that is, af|ter
the manner as the Marble is broken by the Chizzel. This may, perhaps,
&s;eem but a coar&s;e Similitude, for the Explication of the Motion or Action of
Light, which is the mo&s;t curious and &s;piritual of all &s;en&s;ible things. But yet,
I have this to an&s;wer, that the more plain and obvious it is to be under&s;tood,
the better it is to inform the under&s;tanding of the manner how, an Operation,
which is too curious and fine to be reached by our Sen&s;es, is performed. And
though I cannot have an imagination of a Space, but the thou&s;andth Part of
the breadth of a Hair, yet, by my Rea&s;on, I can be certainly informed that &s;uch
a Space there is, and even by Micro&s;copes we can make &s;uch a Space vi&s;ible,
and yet our fancy will dimini&s;h no farther than the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible Point to the
naked Eye; as the point of a &s;harp Needle or the like: But we are not le&s;s
certain of it, though we cannot imagine it, that is, make an Image or Repre|&s;entation
of it to the Mind. Now we are by the Eye a&s;&s;ured that there is
Light, and con&s;equently, I &s;ay, there is a Motion impre&s;&s;ed thereby upon that
Sen&s;e, becau&s;e there is no Sen&s;e but what is made by an Impre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome Mo|tion,
and that Motion is not impre&s;&s;ed but by a Body moved with Local Moti|on,
(for I cannot under&s;tand any other Motion,) and Local Motion mu&s;t have a
Space to pa&s;s, and that Space mu&s;t be pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ome time; and therefore Mo|tions
can only differ in lengths of Spaces and Moments of time; if therefore I
under&s;tand, comprehend, and imagine one Local Motion that falls under the
reach of my Sen&s;es, I can by &s;imilitude comprehend and under&s;tand another that
is ten thou&s;and Degrees below the reach of them, they having both the &s;ame
Proprieties, and differing only in the Spaces and the times; who&s;oever there|fore,
endeavours to explain any in&s;en&s;ible Way of producing an Effect, by
&s;omewhat that is le&s;s intelligible than that which he would explain, acts prepo|&s;terou&s;ly,
as I could have in&s;tanced in the Explications of very famous Men,
which in&s;tead of informing, do much confound and perplex the Under&s;tanding;
but it would be too long for this place.</P>
<P>3. I &s;hall therefore proceed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Light is propagated <HI>in Orbem</HI> &s;hewn.</NOTE> and that is, to explain, how the Motion of
Light is propagated <HI>in Orbem,</HI> for &s;o we find it, which this Similitude I have
here u&s;ed does not reach, but only that of a direct Ray; to make this there|fore
plain to the Under&s;tanding, I would propound a hollow Cone or Bra&s;s, or
&s;ome other &s;trong clo&s;e Sub&s;tance, who&s;e bottom &s;hould be made of a yielding
Sub&s;tance and Spherical, and the <HI>Apex</HI> &s;hould have a Cylindrical Hole, by
which it might be filled with Water, Quick&s;ilver, or &s;ome other fluid Sub|&s;tance:
Into this Cylindrical Hole or Syringe, I would have fitted a Cylinder
&s;o clo&s;e as not to let the Water pa&s;s by it, having filled this hollow Conical
Ve&s;&s;el, I &s;trike again&s;t the end of the Cylinder with a Hammer, and force it to
move the whole length of the Cylindrical Hole; In this ca&s;e it is clear, that
the Water which filled the whole Ve&s;&s;el, and Cylindrical Hole mu&s;t be all mov|ed
towards the bottom, and at the &s;ame In&s;tant that I force in the Cylindrical
Plug; now &s;uppo&s;ing the Water not capable of Conden&s;ation, and the &s;ides of
the Cone not &s;ubject to &s;tretch, and only the bottom capable of being moved;
I find that the Plug mu&s;t have driven all the Water in the Cylindrical Hole in|to
the Cavity of the Cone, and &s;o mu&s;t have driven forward as much as lay
next to it of equal &s;pace, into the &s;pace of another equal Quantity of Water,
and &s;o onward; 'till that which touches the bottom mu&s;t drive the bottom &s;o
<PB N="132" REF="169">
much lower, as to inlarge the Capacity of the Cone enough to receive the Quan|tity
of Water in the Syringe, forced into the Cone by the Plug. Now if we
con&s;ider this Similitude, it will explain &s;ome other Proprieties of the propaga|tion
of Light. For, Fir&s;t, it is clear that every part of the Water mu&s;t be mo|ved
at the &s;ame In&s;tant. Secondly, That there is no rea&s;on why the Motion
of all Parts that lie at equal Di&s;tances from the end of the Syringe, &s;hould
not have the &s;ame Degrees of Motion. Thirdly, Why the Parts that lie more
remote from the Syringe, have &s;till the le&s;s proportion of Motion, communica|ted
to them. Fourthly, It &s;hews us plainly what that proportion is; namely, a
Proportion reciprocal to the Square of the Di&s;tances; for every of tho&s;e Spaces
mu&s;t be equal to the fir&s;t, as therefore the &s;ame quantity of Motion, is expand|ed
into a bigger and bigger <HI>Area,</HI> &s;o mu&s;t its Power upon an equal &s;pace of any
two Di&s;tances, have its Power reciprocal to the <HI>Areas</HI> of tho&s;e Ba&s;es; &s;o that
hereby we &s;ee clearly the rea&s;on why the Power of the Light at &s;everal Di&s;tan|ces
is dimini&s;hed in Reciprocal Proportion to the Expan&s;ion of it. And this may
&s;erve for the Explication of the Propagation of Light, from any &s;ingle Point
of a Luminous Object. Now the &s;ame, thing that we under&s;tand of any one
&s;hining Point of a Luminous Object; the &s;ame thing I &s;ay, we are to conceive
of every one of the whole Luminous Body; for evey point of it doth in the
&s;ame manner propagate its Influence, Power, or Motion; for if in&s;tead of one
Syringe at the end of the Cone, there were Two, Three, or more &s;uch Sy|ringes,
if any of them were moved, the Effect would be the &s;ame, as in that I
have mentioned already&punc; and if all were moved together, every one would
have its Influence on the bottom, as if it had acted &s;ingly, and &s;o evey Point
of the bottom would be affected, or moved by it, as well as every of tho&s;e
Points would al&s;o be affected, or moved by every one of the other Syringes; as
&s;uppo&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 8. Plate 1.</NOTE> <HI>a, e</HI> and <HI>i,</HI> were the three Holes of the&s;e Syringes, and <HI>B, C, D, F,</HI>
were the bottom of the Cone; if the Syringe <HI>e</HI> were moved, it would propa|gate
a Motion, or force to every point <HI>B, C, D, F,</HI> of the bottom <HI>B, F,</HI> &s;o like|wi&s;e
if the Syringe <HI>a,</HI> or the Syringe <HI>i,</HI> were moved &s;ingly, each of them would
propagate their Motion to every one of tho&s;e Points, <HI>B, C, D, F,</HI> of the Ba&s;e
<HI>B, F,</HI> and to every other Point of it. And con&s;equently, all tho&s;e Syringes
being moved together, mu&s;t every of them influence or move every Point of the
Ba&s;e, <HI>B, F,</HI> with its own di&s;tinct Influence. Now the &s;ame thing that will hap|pen
in this Ca&s;e, in the Pre&s;&s;ure or Motion of the Water again&s;t the bottom,
will al&s;o be in the Ca&s;e of Light; for if we &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>a, e, i,</HI> to repre&s;ent the
Body of the Sun, and <HI>B, C, D, F,</HI> the Surface of a Body inlightned by it; It
is mo&s;t certain, that every Point of the Ba&s;e or Object, <HI>B, C, D, F,</HI> is influenc|ed
by every Point of the Superficies of the Sun that &s;hines; &s;o that there may
be con&s;idered in the Radiation of Light, between a Luminous Body, and an in|lightned
Body, two &s;orts of Cones, each made up of infinite Radiations;
namely, the inlightning Cone, and the inlightned Cone; the inlightning Cone
I call that, which is propagated from one Point of a Luminous Body unto all the
Parts of the Body inlightned, &s;uch are <HI>B, a, F, B. B, e, F, B. B, i, F, B.</HI> the ac|tive,
or inlightning Point being the <HI>Apex</HI> thereof, as <HI>a, e</HI> and <HI>i.</HI> And, 2ly, The
inlightned Cone, I call that, which has the inlightned Point for its <HI>Apex,</HI> and
who&s;e Ba&s;e is terminated at the Luminous Body, and all terminate in the in|lightned
Point, &s;o if <HI>a, e, i,</HI> repre&s;ent the Body of the Sun, then <HI>a, B, i, a&punc; a, C,
i, a. a, D, i, a,</HI> and <HI>a, F, i, a.</HI> do each of them repre&s;ent a Cone, whence it will
clearly follow, that the bigger the inlightning Body is, the more Radiations there
will fall upon it, and the more the Cone will be inlightned; and this is one of
the Rea&s;ons why the Light of the Sun does &s;o much exceed the Light of all the
Stars, becau&s;e that in the Hemi&s;phere of the Sun that Shines upon us, there are
more Luminous Points or Radiations than from all the Stars of a whole Hemi|&s;phere
of the Heavens; but there is al&s;o a &s;econd Cau&s;e, and that is to be fetcht
from the greater Di&s;tance of the inlightning Bodies of the Stars; for, as I &s;hew'd
before, the Power of the Light doth decrea&s;e reciprocally to the &s;quares of the
Di&s;tance. For &s;hould all the Luminous Bodies of the Stars be dimini&s;hed in
Diameter, according to their differing Di&s;tances, and be brought &s;o near us, as
the Sun, and &s;o appear all under the &s;ame Angle they now do, their Light
would be con&s;iderably &s;tronger, and greater to us in the Night, and even in the
<PB N="133" REF="170">
Day than now it is; though the <HI>Area</HI> of them all put together, would be no
bigger than now it is; for the Light from the brighte&s;t Star, as of the great
Dog Star, though in a Dark Night it &s;eem very vivid, yet could it be &s;een
with the Light of a part of the Sun appearing of the &s;ame Diameter with it, it
would look very faint and weak. And when I have viewed a Star in the Day|time,
with a Tele&s;cope, though by the help of the Tele&s;cope I have mightily
fortified that Light, and &s;o centuplicated its Power, yet after all, I found that
the Body of it has appeared fainter than the Body of the Moon at Noon.</P>
<P>4. The&s;e then are all the Proprieties we need to take notice of in a &s;imple Propa|gation
of Light through a tran&s;parent uniform <HI>Medium,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proprieties of Light to be ob|&s;erved.</NOTE> Namely, fir&s;t, that there is a
Propagation of Light from every Point of the Surface, in every part of the tran&s;pa|rent
incompa&s;&s;ing Medium <HI>in orbem,</HI> they each of them exert their particular
Influence in that Orb, as if they were all &s;ingle and di&s;tinct. And, Secondly,
That the more of the&s;e &s;ingle Rays there fall upon an inlightned Point, the more
it is inlightned, and that each of the&s;e Rays does act upon the inlightned Body
with the &s;ame Power, as if it acted &s;ingly, though at the &s;ame time, Millions
of Radiations from other Points do act upon it.</P>
<P>This does &s;eem &s;omewhat difficult to be under&s;tood how it &s;hould po&s;&s;ibly
be &s;o:<NOTE PLACE="marg">How a Body may communi|cate different Motions diffe|rent ways.</NOTE> But yet if we con&s;ider, that though we cannot by Sen&s;e apprehend the
very Manner of its Acting; yet we are not without &s;en&s;ible Examples of &s;uch
kind of Actions naturally performed: For if on the &s;mooth Superficies of a
&s;tanding Water, we let fall a Drop of Water, we &s;hall, I &s;ay, plainly &s;ee how
the Motion made by the fall of that Drop is every way propagated in Rings or
Waves increa&s;ing and &s;preading further and further from the Point where the
Motion was begun; and this every way with equal Velocity; which may be
argued from the perfect circular form of &s;uch Rings. But that which comes yet
nearer to the Similitude of Light, and for which Property only I mention it, is,
if we let fall at the &s;ame time 10 or 20 Drops in &s;everal di&s;tances one from
another, we &s;hall find that every one of them will produce Rings about it;
each of which will continue to be propagated equally every way as regularly,
as if there had been but one Drop let fall: And though they variou&s;ly cro&s;s
one another, and &s;o, one would imagine, &s;hould confound the regular progaga|tion
of each others Rings; yet whoever &s;hall ob&s;erve any one of them in the
time of &s;uch propagation, &s;hall find that they are not in the lea&s;t di&s;turbed by
the Action of any other, though they may be cro&s;t with 20 &s;uch differing Con|&s;ecutions
of Rings. And though, I confe&s;s, after all this, it does &s;eem not a
little difficult to comprehend how one and the &s;ame Particle of Matter, or of
the tran&s;parent <HI>Medium,</HI> &s;hould at the &s;ame In&s;tant propagate through it a thou|&s;and
differing Motions, a thou&s;and differing Ways; yet &s;ince we are a&s;&s;ured
by the la&s;t Similitude of the Rings or Waves upon the Surface of the Water,
that it is actually done in Nature, and that vi&s;ible to Sen&s;e, though we cannot
&s;o clearly comprehend the Metaphy&s;ical Rea&s;on thereof: yet 'tis enough for a
Principle to build upon, that we are a&s;&s;ured it is &s;o, and that &s;uch and &s;uch are
the Effects that flow from it. So tho' it be difficult to comprehend the Metaph&s;ical
Rea&s;on, why a Body which is by another moved with a certain Degree of Velo|city,
&s;hould continue to move forwards in a right Line with the &s;ame Velocity
it received, till it be &s;topt by meeting with other Bodies, and communicating
that Motion to them: (For who can under&s;tand what it receives, and what
it parts withal, and what it is di&s;tinct from the E&s;&s;ence of a Body that &s;o moves
it or &s;tays it?) Yet &s;ince we are &s;en&s;ibly informed that really it is &s;o, it will be
enough for a Phy&s;ical Principle of Nature, of which we can have no further
Light or Information, that will make it more plain and certain to us. Now
though it do &s;eem thus difficult to be explain'd, yet 'tis not wholly impo&s;&s;ible.
I do confe&s;s, the Con&s;ideration they have about it, of the nece&s;&s;ity of the Pro|pagation
of it many various Ways through the &s;ame Body, in the &s;ame In&s;tant,
does much confound the Imagination; becau&s;e who can imagine a Body to com|municate
Motion to another, without its being actually moved it &s;elf? And if
it be actually moved it &s;elf, how can it move more than one way at once?
And if it moves but one way, how can it move all the oppo&s;ite Bodies with
their peculiar Propagations?</P>

5. But to this it may be an&s;wered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sen&s;ible Mo|ments compo&s;ed of infinite other.</NOTE> fir&s;t, that there are in every <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> Point

many Millions of di&s;tinct Particles to receive each of them di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides that every &s;en&s;ible Moment of time is compo&s;ed of infinite In&s;tants,
or of an indefinite number of other Moments of time of a &s;horter duration; &s;o
that within a moment of time that is &s;en&s;ible to a Man, the &s;ame &s;en&s;ible Point
may be moved many Millions of ways &s;ucc&s;&s;ively, and &s;o communicate each of
tho&s;e Motions di&s;tinct, without being confounded with any two: And the next
human Moment may have and convey as many others, as many &s;everal ways.
Now that this may be &s;o, we may yet farther con&s;ider, that Motions may be
infinitely &s;wifter than &s;en&s;ible Motions; that is, than tho&s;e Motions that we
can &s;ee a <HI>Prius</HI> and <HI>Po&s;terius</HI> in: For the &s;wifte&s;t Motion that we can &s;ee, is
that wherein we can di&s;tingui&s;h the Body moving from the <HI>Terminus a quo</HI> to
the <HI>Terminus ad quem,</HI> in a &s;en&s;ible time, or a &s;en&s;ible moment: For if it be in
both within the lea&s;t moment of time we are able to di&s;tingui&s;h, it &s;eems to us as
if it were in both the terms and the interjacent &s;pace altogether. For in&s;tance,
take a long String, and &s;tretch it out between two Pins; if it be long and but
&s;lack, we are able to &s;ee and di&s;tingui&s;h it, as it moves from one &s;ide to the o|ther,
and how it returns again, becau&s;e it makes its Vibrations within the com|pa&s;s
of &s;everal human Moments of time; and if it come within three &s;en&s;ible
Moments, we &s;eem to &s;ee it in three &s;en&s;ible Places. But if it be &s;train'd yet
&s;traighter, &s;o as to make its whole Vibration within one human Moment, we
&s;ee it as if it were in all parts of its &s;pace and in the two <HI>Termini</HI> at once, a|bout
which time, and not before, it begins to &s;ound. Upon the &s;ame account
it is, that if you take a Coal of Fire in the Night, and move it to and fro
pretty quick, it &s;eems to make a perfect Line of Fire; whereas if it be moved
&s;low, you &s;ee it di&s;tinct as a Body moved. I could give a hundred In&s;tances by
which I could make it manife&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sen&s;ible Mo|ments of Crea|tures proporti|oned to their bulk.</NOTE> that the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> thereof proceed only from
the length of time there is in the &s;horte&s;t Moment of a Man.</P>
<P>And I do not at all doubt but that the &s;en&s;ible Moments of Creatures are
&s;omewhat proportion'd to their Bulk, and that the le&s;s a Creature is, the &s;hor|er
are its &s;en&s;ible Moments; and that a Creature that is a hundred times le&s;s
than a Man, may di&s;tingui&s;h a hundred Moments in the time that a Man di|&s;tingui&s;hes
one. For when I hear a Fly moving his Wings to and fro &s;o many
times, with &s;uch a Swiftne&s;s as to make a Sound, I cannot but imagine, that
that Fly mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of and di&s;tinguish at lea&s;t 3 Moments in the time that
it makes one of tho&s;e Strokes with his Wings, for that it is able to regulate
and guide it &s;elf by the Motion of them. And the like may be &s;aid for the
quick Motions of other le&s;&s;er Creatures. So that many of tho&s;e Creatures that
&s;eem to be very &s;hort lived in re&s;pect of Man, may yet rationally enough be
&s;uppo&s;ed to have lived, and been &s;en&s;ible of and di&s;tingui&s;hed as many Mo|ments
of time as a Man; becau&s;e within that &s;pace of time it has lived, it has
had as many di&s;tinct Moments of time, and has had as many di&s;tinct Diffe|rences
of Moments, as a Man hath in the Age he lives. But this only by
the by.</P>
<P>But farther, in the third place, as there are infinite Parts in the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible
Part, and infinite Moments in the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible Moment; &s;o there may be in|finite
Parts of Space in the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible Space to be moved. For &s;ince all Space
is infinitely divi&s;ible into le&s;&s;er, we cannot &s;ay how little a Space is nece&s;&s;ary to
be moved to make a &s;en&s;ible Propagation of Light. Po&s;&s;ibly the thou&s;and
thou&s;andth Part of the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible Space, may be &s;ufficient to be moved, to
make the continuation of the Propagation of Light through a Particle. Now
we are &s;en&s;ibly informed by the Micro&s;cope, that the lea&s;t vi&s;ible Space (which
is that which appears under an Angle of half a Minute of a Degree) may be
actually di&s;tingui&s;hed into a thou&s;and &s;en&s;ible Spaces: And could we yet fur|ther
improve Micro&s;copes, 'tis po&s;&s;ible we might di&s;tingui&s;h even a thou&s;and
more Spaces in everyone of tho&s;e we can now &s;ee by the help of tho&s;e Micro|&s;copes
we have already. Now po&s;&s;ibly a le&s;s Space than the lea&s;t of the&s;e may
<PB N="135" REF="172">
be enough for a Body to be di&s;located in the Motion that is nece&s;&s;ary to produce
the Propagation of a Ray of Light.</P>
<P>But then in the fourth place, Velocities may be infinitely &s;wift in tho&s;e Spa|ces:
For who can imagine the &s;mallne&s;s of time that a Motion can be perfor|med
through the &s;malle&s;t of tho&s;e Spaces?</P>
<P>To explain which a little further, I &s;ay, 'tis evident fir&s;t to the Sen&s;e of See|ing,
that the bigger the Body is, the &s;lower is its Vibration, and the &s;maller,
the quicker: Which is evidenced to the Eye in all pendulous Motions, and in
the Recur&s;ions and Vibrations of Pieces of Timber, which the longer and big|ger
they are, the more &s;low are the Vibrations made by them; and the &s;maller
and &s;horter, the quicker. But then where the Eye is unable to a&s;&s;i&s;t us any fur|ther
in di&s;tingui&s;hing the &s;wiftne&s;s of Vibrations, there the Ear comes in with
its a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and carries us much further: And as I &s;hewed before in the Vibra|tions
of Strings, &s;o now I in&s;tance further in Bells, where we find by the Tone,
that the &s;maller the Bell, the &s;harper and more &s;hrill its Sound; and this car|ries
us on to a Sound &s;o &s;harp, that we only call it &s;creeking, and at length it
becomes offen&s;ive to the Ear, becau&s;e beyond that it cannot endure the Sen&s;e of
a &s;hriller Note or quicker Vibration: For that the Shrillne&s;s of the Note depends
upon the quickne&s;s of the Vibration, I think I need not in&s;tance. Hence I con|ceive
that there may be yet beyond the reach of our Ears infinite &s;hriller and
&s;hriller Notes, which may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by Ears or Organs of Hearing adap|ted
by their le&s;&s;er Bulks and finer Parts, to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e quicker Vibrations:
And therefore tho&s;e le&s;&s;er Creatures that we di&s;cover, tho' po&s;&s;ibly they cannot
hear tho&s;e Sounds which we hear, but are able to di&s;tingui&s;h every Turn and
Return of the Vibrations of them by the quickne&s;s and aptne&s;s of their Sight;
yet they may have as great variety in the differences of Sounds wholly imper|ceptible
to us, as we have within the reach of our Ears. And as the Voice of
Man is limited to a certain number of Notes, lower or higher than which no
Human Voice can reach; &s;o may it be in the Voices or Sounds made by tho&s;e
&s;maller Creatures. That this may be &s;o, we may argue yet farther from the
Curio&s;ity and Make of their Sight; for we plainly enough &s;ee, that the &s;maller
the Eye is, the &s;maller is the picture of the vi&s;ible Object that is made at the
bottom of it upon the <HI>Choroeides</HI> or <HI>Tunica Retina.</HI> And this, as I may here|after
explain, is as demon&s;trable from the Principles of Refraction and Op|ticks,
as any one thing in that Science: Which if &s;o, how &s;mall will be the
Picture of the Object that is painted at the bottom of one of tho&s;e Eyes which
by a Micro&s;cope we di&s;cover in the Clu&s;ter of the Eyes of Flies, and other
&s;mall In&s;ects? And yet after all this, we have no rea&s;on to doubt that the&s;e
Creatures are able to di&s;tingui&s;h as many &s;ingle Parts in tho&s;e Pictures, as a Man
can in a proportionate Picture at the bottom of his Eye. For as the Sen&s;ation
of a Man's Sight is limited to a certain bigne&s;s, le&s;s than which none can di&s;tin|gui&s;h;
which, as I have el&s;ewhere &s;hewed, is not le&s;s than what is compri&s;ed
within about a half a Minute of a Degree, at mo&s;t, of the Orbicular Part of the
bottom of the Eye; which in all probability is from the bigne&s;s of the &s;mal|le&s;t
&s;en&s;ible Part receiving the Image, or of the Optick Nerve that is capable of
conveying a di&s;tinct Motion or Sen&s;ation to the Brain, as <HI>Des Cartes</HI> has very
ingeniou&s;ly explained: So in the&s;e &s;mall Creatures, where every thing el&s;e is
proportionably &s;maller, 'tis not at all to be doubted but that tho&s;e Fibres that
convey the Sen&s;ation to their Brain, are proportionably al&s;o &s;maller; and con&s;e|quently
that they mu&s;t have at lea&s;t a Faculty of di&s;tingui&s;hing the Parts of
that Picture, which whole Picture may po&s;&s;ibly be made upon much le&s;s than
half a Minute of a Degree of the Orbicular Part of the bottom of their Eyes
only: For as the Space of tho&s;e Fibres is &s;horter between the bottom of the
Eye and the Brain, &s;o may their bigne&s;s be proportionably &s;maller. All which
Particulars con&s;ider'd, it does &s;eem that Nature has as it were ballanced the
Gifts be&s;towed upon them by &s;ome other Means adapted more particularly to
each of their Con&s;titutions; as were it proper for this Time and Place, I could
more particularly explain and demon&s;trate. But the&s;e Speculations being only
by the by, I &s;hall rather proceed with my Di&s;cour&s;e concerning the Nature of
Light, &s;o as to make the manner of its Operations mechanically and &s;en&s;ibly
intelligible; by con&s;idering further, that if there be a real Motion nece&s;&s;ary for
<PB N="136" REF="173">
every di&s;tinct Propagation of Light, then it will &s;eem to follow, that every
luminous Point mu&s;t have its di&s;tinct Moment to be propagated this way and
that way within the &s;pace of a &s;en&s;ible Moment: Which if it be affirmed to
be &s;o, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on in Nature why it may not be po&s;&s;ible, and that from tho&s;e
four Con&s;iderations I before &s;pecified. So that though the whole Hemi&s;phere
&s;hould be filled with lucid vi&s;ible Points, as we find in a clear &s;tarry Night, that
it is pretty thick &s;et with Stars, and by Tele&s;copes we di&s;cover it to be yet
thicker: Why, I &s;ay, Impre&s;&s;ions may not be made from every one of them
di&s;tinctly and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively upon one &s;ingle &s;en&s;ible Point of Matter in one hu|man
moment; and con&s;equently why the &s;ame Chime of Impul&s;es may not be a|gain
repeated the next Moment, and &s;o perpetually in every human Moment: For
'tis not the Number of them that would at all impede &s;uch a Conclusion, no,
not if there &s;hould be ten thou&s;and times as many more; for there might be
found &s;maller Moments enough within that Space of a &s;en&s;ible or di&s;tingui&s;h|able
Moment, to fit every one with one at lea&s;t: &s;o that the &s;ame point of
Matter might communicate every one of their Impre&s;&s;ions di&s;tinct and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly
within that Period: And be&s;ides this, there might be found di&s;tinct Parts
enough, within the Orb of this lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible Point, to propagate every one of
tho&s;e Motions di&s;tinct, their various ways, by appropriated Parts, all at the
&s;ame In&s;tant.</P>
<P>So that upon the whole, we may a&s;&s;ign to every Propagation of Light through
the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible Space, a real temporary local Motion. And if Mon&s;. <HI>Des
Cartes</HI> by his Propen&s;ion to Motion, and Mr. <HI>Hobbs</HI> by his <HI>Conatus</HI> or Endeavour
to Motion, do not mean &s;uch a real local Motion, their Notions are neither of
them intelligible to others, nor did they really under&s;tand them them&s;elves.
For bare Propen&s;ion to Motion, is not Motion, and con&s;equently cannot pro|pagate
Motion: And Endeavour to move is not moving, and &s;o cannot proga|gate
Motion: But for the Propagation of Motion, Motion is nece&s;&s;ary. And
this I hope has &s;hewed a Po&s;&s;ibility at lea&s;t, if not a Probability, how it may
be made.</P>
<P>6. If then this be &s;o, we may hence deduce the Cau&s;e of the perfect Flui|dity
of the va&s;t quantity of Matter which fills the whole <HI>Expan&s;um</HI> of Space
between the &s;olid Caele&s;tial or Luminous Bodies of the Univer&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cau&s;e of the Fluidity the va&s;t <HI>Ex|pan&s;um.</HI></NOTE> And we may
thence bring a demon&s;trative Rea&s;on why it becomes &s;o free from impeding the
Motions of the Planetary or Cometical Bodies that are moved through it. For
if every one of the&s;e Luminous Points, the Fixt Stars, which fill almo&s;t every
Point of the Heavens in a clear Night (as is made yet much more vi&s;ible by
the help of long Tele&s;copes) be as glorious and Luminous Bodies as the Sun it
&s;elf, though they here appear incomparably le&s;s, and of a fainter Light, by
rea&s;on of their Di&s;tances indefinitely almo&s;t more di&s;tant from us than that is: If,
I &s;ay, every one of tho&s;e Fixt Stars, or glorious Suns, be &s;tuck up and down
here and there in the va&s;t <HI>Expan&s;um</HI> of Matter that fills the whole of Nature,
not at equal but various Di&s;tances one from another; and every one of tho&s;e do
really once at lea&s;t within the &s;pace of one human Moment of time, really
move the whole <HI>Expan&s;um</HI> of the Ethereal Matter (as 'tis mo&s;t evident and
demon&s;trable they do;) then what can there po&s;&s;ibly be more rationally contri|ved
to make and pre&s;erve the perfect Fluidity of the <HI>Aether?</HI> For every Point
of Matter is Millions of ways, and con&s;equently with incredible Velocity mo|ved
to and fro within the compa&s;s of one &s;ingle Moment, and &s;o mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily
have its Parts indefinitely divided, and loo&s;e one from another; and con|&s;equently
being thus fluid, and the minute Motions ballancing each other in
every Point of Matter, and the&s;e Motions being proportionably &s;wifter than the
&s;wifte&s;t Motion of the more bulky Ma&s;s: It follows, I &s;ay, that the Impedi|ment
to any bulky Bodies moving through it, mu&s;t be inconsiderable, or almo&s;t
nothing. For the Parts of this Matter being indefinitely &s;maller than the lea&s;t
&s;en&s;ible Point, and the Motion of each of them, though never &s;o &s;mall, being
within the compa&s;s of a human Moment determined every way, or infinite
ways, the Motion of them one way mu&s;t ballance that of others another, and
con&s;equently give no Impediment to the &s;en&s;ible or bulky Body moved through
them. I could have proceeded further from one and the &s;ame Principle to have
<PB N="137" REF="174">
explain'd how this continued Chime of Motions from every Part do create va|rious
&s;orts of harmonical Motions in concrete Particles, which have their various
and admirable Effects in producing the Harmony which is in Nature. But of
that &s;ome other time, this will be enough at pre&s;ent, to intimate that every one
of the&s;e Caele&s;tial Bodies have their &s;hare in the Motion of the Matter of the
World, and every one of them act more or le&s;s powerfully, according as they
are nearer and nearer po&s;ited to the Parts acted upon; and con&s;equently the
Sun, as I before hinted, becomes in our Parts more con&s;iderable than all the o|ther
Caele&s;tial Bodies. 'Tis po&s;&s;ible there may have been in &s;ome former Ages of
the World, a Notion &s;omewhat like this; but not &s;o well under&s;tood by tho&s;e
that we are beholden to for the Hint of it: Which may be argued both from
the <HI>Platonick</HI> and <HI>Pythagorick Theorys,</HI> and much more from tho&s;e Scraps we
have of the Philo&s;ophy of <HI>Confucius,</HI> the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Philo&s;opher, who was contem|porary
with <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> but wrote of the Philo&s;ophy of an Age fifteen hun|dred
Years before him: But the regaining of it is not to be hoped from any of
their Hints, but from a clear and &s;teddy Geometrical-Method of Rea&s;oning,
proceeding from the more &s;en&s;ible to the more ab&s;tru&s;e and in&s;en&s;ible Cau&s;es and
Effects of things.</P>
<P>Nor can I conceive any other Notion why one Body &s;hould re&s;i&s;t or hinder
Motion more than another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why one Fluid hinders Motion more than ano|ther</NOTE> than that the one is le&s;s fluid than another; that
is, that the &s;olid Parts of the one fluid Body are &s;maller than the &s;olid Parts of
the other fluid Body. And we find it evident to Sen&s;e in &s;en&s;ible Fluids, where
we may &s;en&s;ibly be a&s;&s;ured, that the gro&s;&s;er the Particles of the fluid Body are,
the more impediment does that Body give to the Motion of another Body
through it. As upon the evaporating of Liquors that have &s;olid Bodies in them,
in the mixing of Pouders with Water or other Liquors, and in the mixing of
Salts and Sugars; which give a much greater impediment before they are di&s;|&s;olved
into Fludity than afterwards. If then from &s;en&s;ible Experiments we
proceed to Effects in&s;en&s;ible yet evident to Rea&s;on, we may conclude that the
Aether mu&s;t be abundantly more fluid than any other Body, and indeed may be
&s;aid to be indefinitely fluid; and &s;o the Re&s;i&s;tance that it mu&s;t give to bulky Bo|dies,
mu&s;t be indefinitely &s;mall, becau&s;e there is &s;o mall a Part of it di&s;located
by the tran&s;it of a Body, being indeed nothing but a meer Superficies, or the Parts
of it that are next contiguous to the Body moved through it. But of this I
&s;hall upon onother occa&s;ion &s;ay more, when I &s;hew the Cau&s;e why the Bodies
moved through them, though they do really every moment di&s;locate as much
Body as is equal to them in Bulk, do notwith&s;tanding receive little or no im|pediment
to their progre&s;&s;ive Motion.</P>

<HEAD>The CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I give the Contents of this Section, I think it may be convenient&punc;
in order to the better under&s;tanding of what follows, to premi&s;e, That
our Author having thus far pro&s;ecuted his Inquiries into the Nature of Light,
What it is in the Luminous Body, to wit, a certain Vibrative Motion of its
Parts, of a determinate Velocity. 2dly, What the <HI>Medium</HI> is, how it is
acted upon by Light, and how Light is thereby propagated, with all the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
Qualifications of this <HI>Medium.</HI> 3dly, What this Action is on the
Eye, and how the Powers of Light are exerted upon the &s;en&s;ible Part there|of,
to cau&s;e Vi&s;ion: In&s;tead of proceeding farther in the Method he had
propo&s;ed to him&s;elf, of explaining hove the Rays or Pul&s;es of Light from the
Luminous Bodies are Reflected, Refracted or Inflected, by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
Refraction, bending the Ray into a Curve; which &s;everal Subjects I &s;uppo&s;e
he de&s;ign'd to treat of, though I do not find he ever did (except of Inflection,
of which &s;ee <HI>Micrography,</HI> p. 217.) being diverted by other invervening
Subjects, which carried his Thoughts other ways: And indeed the Field of
Nature is &s;o large, and &s;o plentifully adorn'd with tempting Curio&s;ities,
that it is a Re&s;traint upon the Collector, not to leave one before it is thorough|ly
examined, to reach at another. I &s;ay, when our Author had treated on
the&s;e Heads &s;o far, he leaves this Subject, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e im|perfect;
and taking occa&s;ion from his having mention'd Time and a Human
Moment, he wrote the following Di&s;cour&s;e, wherein,</P>
<Q>1. The Author attempts to &s;hew how we come by the Notion of Time, tho'
the Impre&s;&s;ions on the Sen&s;es are all momentary. The <HI>Communis Sen|&s;us</HI>
not &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e, therefore there is a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uppo|&s;ing
&s;ome other Organ. This he conceives to be what we call Memory,
and then he proceeds to give an Hypothe&s;is to explain Memory, and
how it is performed: That Memory is organical: That the Soul, tho$
an Incorporeal Being, yet in performing its Actions makes u&s;e of Corpo|real
Organs: That Memory is the Repo&s;itory of Ideas form'd by the
Sen&s;es, or rather by the Soul it &s;elf. 2. The Action of the Soul in or|dering
and &s;toring up Ideas, is call'd Attention. The Author's Notion
what it is: That the Place of the Repo&s;itory is &s;omewhere in the Brain,
who&s;e Sub&s;tance is the Material out of which Ideas are formed, the
Chain of which is coyled up in the Repo&s;itory, the Soul being at the Center
where the pre&s;ent Idea is made, which is the pre&s;ent Moment; and
hence comes the Notion of Time and Duration, and is apprehended as a
Quantity. 3. A Mechanical Repre&s;entation &s;uppo&s;ed for the better &V;n|der&s;tanding
the &s;everal Operations of the Soul, <HI>viz.</HI> Apprehending, Re|membring
and Rea&s;oning. That there may be &s;ame certain Point in
the Brain, where the Soul has its chief Re&s;idence, and there receives its
Informations, and gives its Orders. This Repo&s;itory is furni&s;hed with
<PB N="139" REF="176">
adapted Matter for the &V;&s;es of the Soul: Five &s;orts of Matter for the
Impre&s;&s;ions of the Five Sen&s;es: That for Sight explain'd by the <HI>Bono|nian
Pho&s;phorus:</HI> That for Sound by the Va&s;es in antient Theaters and
&V;ni&s;on-tuned Strings. Smelling, Ta&s;ting and Feeling al&s;o after the
&s;ame manner are explained. 4. Out of this adapted Matter the Ideas
formed are material and bulky, of determinate Figures, Sizes and Mo|tions.
That the Soul forms one Idea each Moment, which Moments
differ in duration in different Men. A Computation of the number of
Ideas that may be form'd in a Man's Life. That the Number will not be
found to be an Objection again&s;t this Hypothe&s;is. That Attention is the
Action of the Soul in forming Ideas, and what they are. That they con|tinually
protrude each other from the Center. That the Soul by its Radi|ation
and the Re-action of the Ideas, becomes &s;en&s;ible of them, and &s;o of
Time. How it is &s;en&s;ible of many concomitant Ideas. How &s;ome
Thoughts lo&s;t may be recovered. That this Radiation and Re-action
weakens in a duplicate proportion to the di&s;tance of Time. That the
Soul may exert its Power on any particular Idea, according to its own
Will. That there is a continual Radiation of the Soul in the Repo&s;itory
of Ideas, and is in &s;ome &s;en&s;e reacted upon by them; whence comes
what we call a bringing to remembrance. 5. The Action of the Soul called
Thinking, is a more particular Radiation thereof to this or that part of
the Repo&s;itory. Thinking is partly Memory, and partly an Operation of
the Soul in forming new Ideas. Rea&s;on a more compleat Action of the
Soul from comparing Ideas. As the Repo&s;itory is better &s;tored, &s;o the
Soul acts better. The Soul a &s;elf-moving Principle and <HI>Primum Movens.</HI>
The Soul compared to the Sun in the Great World. If the Sun had &V;n|der&s;tanding,
it would be &s;en&s;ible of the Re&s;i&s;tance its Rays meet with.
This explain'd by Hearing and Seeing. A double Influence from the Sun
on Bodies and their Motions. Tho' we cannot conceive how the Soul, be|ing
&s;piritual and incorporeal, acts upon Ideas that are corporeal, or can
be acted upon by them; yet we are a&s;&s;ured &s;uch Effects are performed.
That the Soul is net confin'd to act only upon the&s;e Ideas, but may extend its
Power to every part of the Body, and po&s;&s;ibly to &s;ome con&s;iderable Di&s;tance
from the Body. <HI>R. W.</HI></Q>
<P>BEfore I come to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ing of the particular Matters treated of the la&s;t
Section,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How we come by the Notion of Time.</NOTE> I would a little further con&s;ider what I have been di&s;cour&s;ing of,
<HI>viz.</HI> Time: And here, &s;ince it is a general Maxim in the Schools, that <HI>Nihil e&s;t in
Intellectu, quod non fuit prius in Sen&s;u,</HI> I would query by what Sen&s;e it is we
come to be informed of Time; for all the Information we have from the Sen|&s;es
are momentary, and only la&s;t during the Impre&s;&s;ions made by the Ob|ject.
There is therefore yet wanting a Sen&s;e to apprehend Time; for &s;uch a
Notion we have: And yet no one of our Sen&s;es, nor all together, can furni&s;h us
with it, and yet we conceive of it as a Quantity. For this therefore, &s;ince we
cannot find any external or outward Sen&s;e, we mu&s;t &s;eek within, and we &s;hall
find there is &s;omewhat like that which is called <HI>Communis Sen&s;us,</HI> which is re|ceptive
of all the outward Impre&s;&s;ions of the other Sen&s;es. But &s;till this is
in&s;ufficient to afford us the Notion or Knowledge of Time; for the Impre&s;|&s;ions
on that can be no other than the Impre&s;&s;ions from the other Sen&s;es, con|veyed
by the <HI>Media</HI> of the &s;en&s;ory Nerves, which ma&s;t be al&s;o momentary, as
well as the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions, and con&s;equently do not yet &s;ufficiently inform us
of the Notion of Time. Con&s;idering this, I &s;ay, we &s;hall find a Nece&s;&s;ity of
&s;uppo&s;ing &s;ome other Organ to apprehend the Impre&s;&s;ion that is made by Time.
And this I conceive to be no other than that which we generally call Memory,
which Memory I &s;uppo&s;e to be as much an Organ, as the Eye, Ear or No&s;e,
<PB N="140" REF="177">
and to have its Situation &s;omewhere near the Place where the Nerves from the
other Sen&s;es concur and meet.</P>
<P>Now that it is really,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Memory Orga|nical</NOTE> I argue from this, that it may be both im|proved
and impaired, it may be de&s;troyed and exalted to a great Perfection.
It is at &s;ome times &s;en&s;ible, and at other times wholly in&s;en&s;ible, as particularly
in Sleep: And whenever 'tis &s;o, we have no Sen&s;e of Time, but we pa&s;s over
all that Space of Time, as if it had not been, and we only come to under|&s;tand
it by other Circum&s;tances. Be&s;ides, we have often known that the Me|mory
has been quite de&s;troyed by a Fall, or great Blow upon the Head, by a
Fever, or other great Sickne&s;s; nay often by Exce&s;s of Drinking, all which
affect not the Soul: And in probability, this might be cau&s;ed by &s;ome Wound,
Hurt, Brui&s;e, or &s;ome orher Di&s;temper of that Part, which we conceive to be
the Organ of Memory; which makes it an unfit Organ for the Soul to make
u&s;e of for that effect; and con&s;equently the Soul can no more remember with|out
the Organ of Memory, than it can &s;ee without the Organ of Sight, the Eye,
or hear without an Ear. For the Soul, or fir&s;t Principle of Life, tho' it be an
Incorporeal Being, yet in performing its Actions, makes u&s;e of Corporeal
Organs, and without them cannot effect what it wills.</P>
<P>Memory then I conceive to be nothing el&s;e but a Repo&s;itory of Ideas formed
partly by the Sen&s;es, but chiefly by the Soul it &s;elf: I &s;ay, partly by the Sen&s;es,
becau&s;e they are as it were the Collectors or Carriers of the Impre&s;&s;ions made
by Objects from without, delivering them to the Repo&s;itory or Storehou&s;e
where they are to be u&s;ed. Which Impre&s;&s;ions being actual Motions, as I have
plainly proved in the Explication of the Organ of the Eye, and the Operation
of Light, tho&s;e Motions conveyed to this Repo&s;itory become Powers &s;ufficient
to effect &s;uch Formations of Ideas as the Soul does guide and direct them in:
For I conceive no Idea can be really formed or &s;tored up in this Repo&s;itory,
without the Directive and Archiectonical Power of the Soul; and the Actions
or Impre&s;&s;ions cea&s;e and fail without the concurrent Act of the Soul, which
regulates and di&s;po&s;es of &s;uch Powers.</P>
<P>2. This Action of the Soul is that which is commonly called <HI>Attention,</HI> by
which what is meant no one does further or more intelligibly explain, than on|ly
by giving the &s;ame Notion by &s;ome other ways of Expre&s;&s;ion, which, it may
be are as little intelligible. My Notion of it is this, that the Soul in the Action
of Attention does really form &s;ome material Part of the Repo&s;itory into &s;uch a
Shape, and gives it &s;ome &s;uch a Motion as is from the Sen&s;es conveyed thither;
which being &s;o formed and qualified, is in&s;erted into and inclo&s;ed in the com|mon
Repo&s;itory, and there for a certain time pre&s;erved and retained, and &s;o
becomes an Organ, upon which the Soul working, finds the Ideas of pa&s;t Acti|ons;
as if the Action were pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>This Repo&s;itory I conceive to be &s;eated in the Brain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author's Motion concern|ing Ideas.</NOTE> and the Sub&s;tance there|of
I conceive to be the Material out of which the&s;e Ideas are formed, and
where they are al&s;o pre&s;erved when formed, being di&s;po&s;ed in &s;ome regular
Order; which Order I conceive to be principally that according to which they
are formed, that being fir&s;t in order that is fir&s;t formed, and that next which is
next, and &s;o continually by Succe&s;&s;ion, from the time of our Birth to the time
of our Death. So that there is as it were a continued Chain of Ideas coyled up
in the Repo&s;itory of the Brain, the fir&s;t end of which is farthe&s;t removed from the
Center or Seat of the Soul where the Ideas are formed; and the other End is
always at the Center, being the la&s;t Idea formed, which is always the Moment
pre&s;ent when con&s;idered: And therefore according as there are a greater number
of the&s;e Ideas between the pre&s;ent Sen&s;ation or Thought in the Center, and
any other, the more is the Soul apprehen&s;ive of the Time interpo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the <HI>Supollex</HI> of the Soul, and the&s;e are the In&s;truments it makes
u&s;e of in the apprehending of things or Actions pa&s;t; and by the&s;e it becomes
&s;en&s;ible of all that it really knows, and according to the Perfection or Imper|fection,
the Multitude or Paucity, the Regularity or Irregularity of the Order
and Di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e Ideas in the Repo&s;itory or Memory, the Aptitude or
Ineptitude of the Sub&s;tance for Formation, Radiation, Di&s;po&s;ition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o is
the Soul the better enabled, Fir&s;t, to form new Ideas aright, or rightly to ap|prehend
the thing to be known. Secondly to apprehend the Order according
<PB N="141" REF="178">
to which they have been formed, and are ranged; that is, to know the time,
or, to &s;peak in the common Phra&s;e, to remember what is pa&s;t, as if it were
pre&s;ent, and how long it is &s;ince it was done, by the number of Ideas beween.
The Soul therefore under&s;tands Time, or becomes &s;en&s;ible of Time, only by
the help of the Organ of the Memory, which Organ is this Repo&s;itory of Ideas,
and by means of the Order, Situation and Di&s;tance of the &s;aid Ideas, from
the Center, or one among another, &s;o it becomes &s;en&s;ible of Time: And Time,
as unner&s;tood by Man, is nothing el&s;e but the Length of the Chain of the&s;e
Ideas, between any two that are at any time apprehended together: And ac|cording
to the Number of the Links in this Chain, &s;o is the Impre&s;&s;ion made to
the Soul that apprehends it, of a longer or &s;horter time interpo&s;ed; and the
Notion of Time is the Apprehen&s;ion of the Di&s;tance of Ideas from the Center
or pre&s;ent Moment. And &s;o Time comes to be apprehended as a Quantity,
and &s;o falls under the Con&s;ideration of Geometry and Men&s;uration.</P>
<P>3. Now becau&s;e nothing is &s;o well under&s;tood or apprehehded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;en&s;ible Re|pre&s;entation of the Matter.</NOTE> as when it
is repre&s;ented under &s;ome &s;en&s;ible Form, I would, to make my Notion the more
conceivable, make a mechanical and &s;en&s;ible Figure and Picture thereof, and
from that &s;hew how I conceive all the Actions and Operations of the Soul as
Apprehending, Remembring and Rea&s;oning are performed.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e then that there may be a certain Place or Point &s;omewhere in the
Brain of a Man, where the Soul may have its principal and chief Seat.</P>
<P>I will not now enter upon Arguments or Rea&s;onings from Experiments or Ob|&s;ervations,
to determine the preci&s;e Place, though concerning the definitive Po|&s;ition
thereof, I have much that I may at another time produce: But I will
only &s;uppo&s;e at pre&s;ent, that there may be &s;ome &s;uch Place whereinto all the
Impre&s;&s;ions made from the Sen&s;es upon adapted Matter may be deliver'd;
which Impre&s;&s;ions, as I have el&s;ewhere explain'd, are no other but actual Loco|motions
given to the Parts of Matter or Bodies &s;o or &s;o moved.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e then this Repo&s;itory to be furni&s;hed with variety of Matter adapted
for the U&s;es to which the Soul applies them, which I call the Elements out of
which Ideas are made; among which Variety there are principally five &s;orrs fit|ted
and adapted to receive the Impre&s;&s;ions from the five Sen&s;es; that is, one
peculiar Kind for the Impre&s;&s;ions of Sight, which is of &s;uch a Quality, Form,
Make, Bulk, or other Con&s;titution, as makes it Receptive and Retentive of the
Impre&s;&s;ions of Light and Colours, which none of the other Bodies are capable
of. Which may a little be explain'd by the Matter of the Pho&s;phoros made
of the <HI>Bononian</HI> Stone, or that found out by <HI>Baldwinus</HI> made of Chalk and
Niter; which Matters are &s;o made and adapted by the Chymical Preparations
of them by the force of Fire and Mixtures made in their Proce&s;&s;es, that they,
&s;o &s;oon as expo&s;ed to the Impre&s;&s;ions of Light, receive and retain tho&s;e Impre&s;|&s;ions,
though for no long time, yet enough to &s;hew us a Specimen of a certain
Qualification not to be found in mo&s;t other Bodies, which may yet po&s;&s;ibly be
done much more powerfully and effectually by the Chymi&s;try of Nature in the
Dige&s;tions and Preparations made in the wonderful Elaboratory of the Animal
Body; where all things are are ordered and adapted by the All wi&s;e Creator,
for the Work to be done: So that nothing can be imagined wanting or redun|dant
to perform what is by his Intention de&s;ign'd to be done.</P>
<P>Another &s;ort of Matter I &s;uppo&s;e to be that which is fitted to receive the Im|pre&s;&s;ions
of Sound, &s;omewhat like tho&s;e Bells or Va&s;es which <HI>Vitruvius</HI> men|tions
to be placed in the antient Theaters, which did receive and return the
Sound more vigorous and &s;trong; or like the Uni&s;on-toned Strings, Bells or
Gla&s;&s;es, which receive Impre&s;&s;ions from Sounds without, and retain that Im|pre&s;&s;ion
for &s;ome time, an&s;wering the Tone by the &s;ame Tone of their own.
And though in the&s;e Examples (which I am fain to bring for Explication only)
there &s;eems wanting the great Requi&s;ite of a Power to retain for a long while
tho&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions which are &s;o given, they all of them lo&s;ing them in a very
&s;hort time; yet, as I &s;hall by and by &s;hew, they do and will each of them re|tain
their &s;everal Impre&s;&s;ions long enough to make them &s;ufficient for producing
the &s;ame Reactions whenever they are again acted upon. And &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;|ion
I &s;hall prove is again given both by the Soul and by &s;ucceeding &s;imilar Sen|&s;ations:
<PB N="142" REF="179">
Far having Potentiality of receiving, and being excited by &s;uch Im|pre&s;&s;ions,
they do again renew their former Impre&s;&s;ion, and afre&s;h &s;hew their
Power, in the &s;ame manner as the Mu&s;ical String or Bell, or the well prepared
<HI>Bmonian</HI> or <HI>Baldwin</HI> Pho&s;phorus do each &s;hew their Natures, when the one is
&s;truck or agitated by Motion, and the other acted upon by Light.</P>
<P>The like appropriated Materials I &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o for the Impre&s;&s;ions of the other
Three Sen&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> Smelling, Ta&s;ting, Feeling; each of which are qualified to
receive and retain the Impre&s;&s;ions from the other Sen&s;es. As for in&s;tance, the
Smell being cau&s;ed by a &s;ubtil and curious Exhalation from the odoriferous Body
imbibed by the Air, the Olfactory Nerves are prepared with an aerial Body fit
to di&s;&s;olve or imbibe that Sub&s;tance in the &s;ame manner as the Air does from
the odoriferous Body; which aerial Body, by means of the Olfactory Nerve,
having an immediate Intercour&s;e and Pa&s;&s;age to the Brain, does immediately
convey it thither: And according to the nature of this aerial or &s;pirituous Sub|&s;tance
with which the Olfactory Nerve is furni&s;hed, &s;o does it di&s;&s;olve or im|bibe
this or that Exhalation out of the Air. Whence I conceive that it is of
di&s;tinct Natures in every Species of Animals, and thence that every one of them
have di&s;tinct Sen&s;ations of the <HI>&s;ame Effluvia,</HI> and that which is congruous and
agreeing to one, is of a contrary nature to another; and thence what is grate|ful
to one is odious to another. And again, what is &s;en&s;ible to one &s;ort of
Creature, who has an aerial Sub&s;tance fitted to di&s;&s;olve and imbibe &s;uch or &s;uch
a Steam, is wholly in&s;en&s;ible to another that wants that aerial Sub&s;tance, and
is furni&s;ht with one of a differing Nature. Which I conceive to be the rea&s;on,
why Dogs and other Creatures have &s;o &s;trong a Faculty of &s;melling the Scent
of Animals, or the Fle&s;h of them, which are very hardly di&s;coverable to a
Man. On the other &s;ide, in probability Man is &s;en&s;ible of many things, as the
Smell of Flowers, Herbs and Fruits, which po&s;&s;ibly a Dog does very little, if
at all &s;cent.</P>
<P>The like may be &s;aid of the Ta&s;te, which I conceive lies only in the Nature
of the watery Liquor conveyed by the Nerves of Ta&s;te to the Tongue, accord|ing
to the Nature of which for di&s;&s;olving this or that Sub&s;tance of the Bodies
touching it, is the Impre&s;&s;ion of Ta&s;te conveyed to the Brain. And &s;o we may
&s;ee a clear Rea&s;on why one Ta&s;te may be ta&s;ted by one, which is not by another,
and why one Ta&s;te is plea&s;ant to one Creature which is not &s;o to another, and
how a Body becomes gu&s;table or ta&s;tele&s;s, and how that which is ta&s;tle&s;s in it
&s;elf may be made ta&s;table, and why that which is ta&s;table may be made ta&s;te|le&s;s.
of both which kinds I could give hundreds of In&s;tances which would
much confirm this my Theory, and &s;hew what Improvements of this kind could
be made. The like, I conceive, is to be &s;aid of an adapted Matter for receiv|ing
and retaining the Impre&s;&s;ions of Feeling, &s;omewhat after the nature of the
warming Stone, and &s;everal other &s;uch Sub&s;tances, which do imbibe tho&s;e Im|pre&s;&s;ions
more readily, and retain them for a longer time. Now I do &s;uppo&s;e,
that the Repo&s;itory is continually &s;upplied with a &s;ufficient quantity of the&s;e
kinds of Sub&s;tances, with which the Sen&s;e does continually form Ideas, and
di&s;po&s;e of them into the Repo&s;itory of Memory, and that without tho&s;e Ma|terials,
and the concurrent Impre&s;&s;ions of the Sen&s;es, it cannot form them:
For otherwi&s;e a blind Man would have Ideas of Colours, which yet he has not,
and a &s;ick Man would have a true Idea of Ta&s;ies, which yet he has not.</P>
<P>But to return to the con&s;ideration of the Place or Repo&s;itory where the&s;e Ideas
are form'd and retain'd.</P>
<P>4. I &s;uppo&s;e there may be about this place, which I will hence&s;forward call
the Center,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ideas ma|terial and bul|$y.</NOTE> a certain Sphere of Capacity filled with adapted Matter, for the
Formation, Reception, and containing of all the Ideas which &s;hall be emitted
from the &s;aid Center. The&s;e Ideas I will &s;uppo&s;e to be material and bulky,
that is, to be certain Bodies of determinate bigne&s;s, and impregnated with de|terminate
Motions, and to be in them&s;elves di&s;tinct; and therefore that no
two of them can be in the &s;ame &s;pace, but that they are actually different and
&s;eparate one from another; and as they have their di&s;tinct Figures, &s;o have
they each of them their di&s;tinct Qualifications of Motions and Constitutions.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="180">
I will &s;uppo&s;e further, that the Soul may every moment, partly by its own
immediate Power, and partly by the help of the Impre&s;&s;ions produced by the
Sen&s;es, form one of the&s;e Ideas, and in&s;ert it into the Repo&s;itory. Which
Moments in &s;ome Men may be more, in &s;ome may be le&s;s, within the &s;ame
compa&s;s of time, according to the Activity of the Soul it &s;elf, and according
to the Aptitude or Unfitne&s;s of the Matter to be wrought upon. So that in
&s;ome there may be Four of them formed in a &s;econd Minute of Time, in o|thers
po&s;&s;ibly not One in two Seconds of Time: And according to the Per|fection
and Aptne&s;s of the Matter to be formed, and the Activity of the Soul in
performing its Effects, &s;o are there more of the&s;e Ideas formed within the &s;ame
Space of time. So that a Man of an ordinary Con&s;titution of Soul and Body,
that is, one of a middle Degree between the more active and quick, and one of
the more &s;low and dull, may within the compa&s;s of his Life, &s;uppo&s;ing he
&s;hould live to a hundred Years of Age (which yet not one of a hundred thou|&s;and
thou&s;and does arrive to) form within that compa&s;s of time, and &s;tore up
in his Repo&s;itory, a thou&s;and Millions of di&s;tinct Ideas; all which may have
followed each other in a continued Series, beginning with the time of the fir&s;t
Advertency of the Child, and continuing to the time of the actual Separation
of the Soul and Body at Death, Which I thus compute: A hundred Years
contain 36525 Days, and 36525 Days contain 876600 Hours, and 876600
Hours contain 3155760000 Seconds. Now one with another, when the Soul is
intent and acting, there may be 3600 formed within the compa&s;s of an Hour,
and &s;o one in a Second of Time. So that if the Soul could through the whole
Cour&s;e of 100 Years be continually &s;o intent, and &s;o acting and forming the&s;e
Ideas, and in&s;erting them into this&punc; Repo&s;itory or Organ of Memory, there
might be there repo&s;ed 3155760000 Ideas. But by rea&s;on of Sleep interpo&s;ed,
one third Part of the Number will be taken off, the Soul then for the mo&s;t part
cea&s;ing to form Ideas, or when it does, they are only imperfect and lo&s;t. So
that there will remain but 2103840000, or to take a round Sum, but 21 hundred
Millions. Now if we examine this remaining two thirds of Time or Moments,
and therein con&s;ider what part of the time remaining is lo&s;t in Infancy, Old
Age, Sickne&s;s and Inadvertency, we may well reckon that two thirds of the&s;e
remaining Moments are lo&s;t, and no Ideas at all formed in them; and &s;o in|&s;tead
of 21 hundred, there will remain but the number of 7 hundred Millions.
And if we again con&s;ider how &s;mall a part of the&s;e are indu&s;triou&s;ly and care|fully
&s;tored up, we may very well agree, that not above a &s;eventh Part of the&s;e
are &s;tored up: And &s;o one hundred Millions may be a &s;ufficient Number to be
&s;uppo&s;ed for all the Ideas that may have been trea&s;ured up in the Organ of Me|mory
through the whole Cour&s;e of a Man's Life, though of a hundred Years
continuance; and con&s;equently one Year with another may be &s;uppo&s;ed to add
to this Store about one Million of Ideas. But if we con&s;ider how much this
will amount to for every Day, we &s;hall find that yet the Number is very much
too big, and mu&s;t be yet very much dimini&s;hed: For when we con&s;ider that
this will &s;till make 2738 Ideas for every Day of the hundred Years; and if a
Man con&s;iders with him&s;elf how many he conceives he may have added to his
Store in one Month next la&s;t pa&s;t, I am apt to think he will conclude, that one
with another, it will be enough to allow one Tenth of that Number for the
Number of Ideas that have obtained a Place in this Repo&s;itory, the Organ of
Memory. So that if a Man allows but two or three hundred a Day, nay, but
one hundred for every Day he hath lived, &s;ince he was born to his pre&s;ent Mo|ment,
he will find that Number large enough to contain all the Ideas he has
really &s;tored up in the Organ of his Memory. As &s;uppo&s;ing a Man of fifty
Years of Age, who according to that compute mu&s;t have lived 18262 Days;
and con&s;equently if you reckon but a hundred for each Day, mu&s;t have 1826200.
It will be very hard, I conceive, for a Man of that Age perfectly to remember &s;o many di&s;tinct things, though yet I will not &s;ay it is impo&s;&s;ible. But &s;uppo|&s;ing
he could by recollecting remember 100 Millions, and con&s;equently mu&s;t
have as many di&s;tinct Ideas, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on why all the&s;e may not actually be
contained within the Sphere of the Activity of the Soul acting in the Center.
For if we con&s;ider in how &s;mall a bulk of Body there may be as many di&s;tinct
living Creatures as here are &s;uppo&s;ed Ideas, and every of the&s;e Creatures per|fectly
<PB N="144" REF="181">
formed and endued with all its Vegetative and Animal Functions, and
with &s;ufficient room al&s;o left for it to move it &s;elf to and fro among and be|tween
all the re&s;t, &s;o as to pa&s;s by every one and touch none, we &s;hall not need
to fear any Impo&s;&s;iblity to find out room in the Brain where this Sphere may be
placed, and yet find room enough for all other U&s;es, of which we may after|wards
a&s;&s;ign &s;ome very nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>But to return to the De&s;cription of this Organ. I do &s;uppo&s;e that what we
call Attention is nothing el&s;e but the Action of the Soul in forming certain Ideas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attention what.</NOTE>
which for the pre&s;ent I will call little Images, which bear the Stamp, Seal or
Mould according to which the Soul formed it in the Center of the Repo&s;itory.
I &s;uppo&s;e further, that the&s;e are continually formed by the Soul in the Center,
and the pre&s;ent always protrudes tho&s;e that were formed before it further into
the Repo&s;itory. So that the greater the number of Ideas are that have &s;ucceed|ed
any ones Formation, the greater is the Space of Time of which we have
a Sen&s;e: and the ideas become further and further removed from the Center,
and more and more new-form'd Ideas interpo&s;e them&s;elves between the Center
and the &s;aid Ideas placed in Orbs at a greater di&s;tance, by the intru&s;ion of fre&s;h
Ideas between the Center and them.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e further, that all the&s;e Ideas, though they may for a long time re|tain
the Forms and Motions impre&s;s'd on them by the Sen&s;es, and by the Action
of the Soul; yet notwith&s;tanding they being material, and &s;o &s;ubject to change,
I conceive, that as the Motions may in time decay, &s;o the Form may (by &s;hift|ing
and changing place in the Repo&s;itory or Organ of Memory, and being pro|truted
farther and farther from the Center or Seat of the Soul, and crouded
into Orbs, though further off, yet clo&s;er and clo&s;er &s;tuffed and crouded toge|ther)
be in time alter'd, and &s;ometimes quite lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e further, that the Soul being &s;eated in this Center, and there acting,
as I &s;aid, by the help of the Information and Impre&s;&s;ions of the Sen&s;es, and
forming continually new Ideas, and &s;o protruding them onwards, and filling
the Sphere of the Repo&s;itory fuller and fuller from the Center, increa&s;ing out|wards.
I &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;ay, that this Soul by its Radiation does actually appre|hend,
or as it were feel, or is &s;en&s;ible of any Idea that remains trea&s;ured up
within this Repo&s;itory: And this it becomes &s;en&s;ible of, partly from its own
Power of Radiation, and partly from the Re-action of the Ideas. It becomes,
I &s;ay, &s;en&s;ible of them, wherever placed within the Repo&s;itory; partly by its
own Radiation, by which it acts upon the fluid Spirits incompa&s;&s;ing it, propa|gating
from it &s;elf every way <HI>in Orbem,</HI> a Radiation like the Sun, by which,
as by a Stick, it becomes &s;en&s;ible of all tho&s;e Ideas that are yet unwa&s;ted with|in
the Repo&s;itory, feeling as it were their Form, their Re&s;i&s;tance, and their
Re-action to its Radiations: Partly, I &s;ay, only by their lying in the way of
the Radiation, and partly al&s;o by their re-acting and repercu&s;&s;ing a Radiation
back upon the Soul. By the Di&s;tance of it from this Center the Soul becomes
&s;en&s;ible in &s;ome mea&s;ure of the time in which the Idea was made, and how
long &s;ince it was in&s;erted, there being &s;o many Orbs of later or more inner Ideas
formed and lying between them, which have been &s;ince in&s;erted.</P>
<P>By this means it becomes &s;en&s;ible of many Ideas that accompanied that Idea,
when made, many of them having kept the &s;ame Order in which they were
made; though oftimes other Ideas, not formed immediately before or after,
intrude and thru&s;t in them&s;elves between, out of the order they did really &s;uc|ceed
in, &s;o as often to interrupt and break the Chain or Order of In&s;ertion.</P>
<P>I conceive further, that be&s;ides the natural Decay there may be of the Form
and impre&s;t Motion of the Ideas, there may be al&s;o an Impediment to this
Radiation of the Soul, by the Interpo&s;ition of other Ideas between the Center
and the Idea &s;ought, much after the manner as the Earth interpo&s;ing between the
Moon and the Sun, hinders the Sun from radiating upon the Moon. And in
&s;uch ca&s;e the Idea may &s;ometimes be thought to be lo&s;t, which yet may after|wards
be found again when the Ob&s;tacle is removed.</P>
<P>Again, as in the Radiation of the Sun, which is as it were a Repre&s;entation
of the Soul of the World; the Radiation of the Soul is more powerful upon
Ideas at a nearer than at a further Di&s;tance; and their Reaction is al&s;o more
powerful back again, and that in a duplicate proportion to their Di&s;tance reci|procal
<PB N="145" REF="182">
much the &s;ame with that of Light, which is the mo&s;t &s;piritual Action
of all we are &s;en&s;ible of in the World. And thence it is, that the Memory of
things long &s;ince done is for the mo&s;t part very faint, unle&s;s in &s;ome ca&s;es, where
the Impre&s;&s;ions made upon tho&s;e Ideas were at fir&s;t very powerful, or often
recalled, which may be &s;aid to be a new forming of them.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e further,<NOTE PLACE="marg">There is a con|tinual Radia|tion of the Soul into the Repo|sitory.</NOTE> that though by means of the continual Radiation of the
Soul into this Repo&s;itory or Organ of Memory, it has at all times &s;en&s;e
of all the Ideas that are there repo&s;ed, yet that Sen&s;e is but imperfect and
confu&s;ed by rea&s;on of the Multitude; yet can it readily exert its Pow|er
more particularly and &s;trongly to this or that Idea, according to the Deter|mination
of its Will. And when&s;oever it is upon the Action of Thinking,
that is, of fixing or darting its Radiation more powerfully upon this or that
Idea placed in the Repo&s;itory, it does according to the Power of its Radiation
receive a more &s;en&s;ible Impre&s;&s;ion or Repercu&s;&s;ion from tho&s;e Ideas upon which
it radiates, and thereby it does not only apprehend their Qualifications more di|&s;tinctly,
but al&s;o it does as it were renew or refre&s;h the former Impre&s;&s;ions, and
add to them a further degree of Perfection: And &s;o though they are in a Place
farther di&s;tant from its Center, and by the length of time or the number of
Ideas that have been &s;ince in&s;erted, and &s;o lie in the way of Communication,
it be become more faint and weak in the retaining the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion, and con&s;e|quently
in its re-acting Power; yet by this &s;econd Action or Radiation of the
Soul upon it, its Form and Qualifications are renewed and perfected, and for
the future it becomes more powerful than the re&s;t of tho&s;e at the &s;ame or le&s;&s;er
Di&s;tances, that have not been by &s;uch &s;econd Radiations &s;o renewed and invigo|rated;
and be&s;ides every &s;uch Action of the Soul does create and form a new
Idea at the Center, which has Impre&s;&s;ions that are the Re&s;ult of tho&s;e renewed
Actions: And this having &s;omewhat the like Figure and Motions or Qualifica|tions,
it has a Sympathetick Agreement with the other; and the Impre&s;&s;ions
from the one do more readily make the Impre&s;&s;ions from the other more &s;en&s;ible,
in the &s;ame manner as a Mu&s;ical String being moved, does make another String
that is uni&s;on or harmonious with it, move al&s;o, and &s;o together make the
Sound the louder, or the Impre&s;&s;ion the &s;tronger.</P>
<P>Next, as I &s;uppo&s;e there is a continual Radiation of the Soul into the whole
Repo&s;itory of Ideas, &s;o I do conceive likewi&s;e that every Idea &s;o placed being
&s;o qualified as above, by particular Impre&s;&s;ions of Motions, which continue for
a long time &s;o to move, as they were at fir&s;t impregnated, does from &s;uch its
Power &s;o retained, radiate a Motion of its own, which may in &s;ome manner
al&s;o act upon the Soul, &s;o as to excite it to Attention; and by this means al&s;o
whenever any Idea is created and impregnated with Motions or Qualifications
&s;imilar to tho&s;e of other Ideas placed at &s;ome di&s;tance in the Repo&s;itory, the
concurrent Impre&s;&s;ions or Re-actions of tho&s;e &s;imilar Ideas upon the Soul at that
time do make the fainter to be the more notable, and &s;o excite the Soul to At|tention
or Radiation that way al&s;o; and by that means it has an Excitement to
be more &s;en&s;ible of the other al&s;o at that moment: And this I take to be that
Impre&s;&s;ion which we are &s;en&s;ible of, when we &s;ay, This brings to my Mind, or
This puts me in mind, or this makes me remember, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>5. I do further conceive, that that Action of the Soul which we call Think|ing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Thinking is.</NOTE>
is a more particular Radiation of the Soul to this or that part of the Re|po&s;itory,
or on this or that Idea placed in it, and at the &s;ame time forming new
Ideas in the Center of the Repo&s;itory; which Action of the Soul in framing
new Ideas at the Center, is continued almo&s;t every moment: And though it
doth not every moment make a di&s;tinct Idea, yet may it be perfecting of one,
and giving new Impre&s;&s;ions every moment: And thence I conceive the Body of
one Idea (for as I before mention'd, I &s;uppo&s;e them to be really corporeal and
material) may have many and various Impre&s;&s;ions and Motions annexed to it,
po&s;&s;ibly of 100, nay of 1000 Moments, whence that Idea may be &s;uppo&s;ed to
be more compleat and perfect in it &s;elf: And when it again comes to be acted
upon by the Radiation of the Soul, all the Impre&s;&s;ions or Qualifications there|of
become of Power to affect the Soul with tho&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions which it had for|merly
received from the Soul.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="183">
So that Thinking is partly Memory, and partly an Operation of the Soul in
forming new Ideas.</P>
<P>Another and more compleat Action of the Soul, is the forming new Ideas
from the comparing the Re-actions from &s;everal Ideas placed here and there in
the Repo&s;itory, and its being &s;en&s;ible of the Harmony or Di&s;cord of them one
with another, which does produce an Idea wherein all tho&s;e various Re&s;pects are
in &s;ome means united and impre&s;&s;ed upon one and the &s;ame Idea. This is an
Idea of greater Perfection, and according to the Attention of the Soul in being
&s;en&s;ible of more and more variety of former Ideas, and the Regularity and Order
of its proceeding in that Action, and the more &s;teddy and di&s;tinct manner in
the Cour&s;e and Progre&s;s of it, &s;o is the Idea more compleat, as well as more
compounded: And this I conceive to be that Action of the Soul which is com|monly
called Rea&s;oning; and the Conclu&s;ion is the new Impre&s;&s;ion made upon
the Idea informing from the compari&s;on of other Ideas which may be contain'd
in the <HI>major</HI> and <HI>minor</HI> Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Now according as the Repo&s;itory is &s;tored with more and more Ideas, &s;o has the
Soul a greater variety to range and expatiate into, whether the&s;e Ideas are only the
fir&s;t and more &s;imple, &s;uch as are the Re&s;ults from the Impre&s;&s;ions of the
Sen&s;es; or the more compounded, &s;uch as are made by the Re&s;ult of comparing
&s;everal together: And therefore accordingly the Ideas that are made from few|er
and more &s;imple Ideas, are le&s;s compounded Ideas; and tho&s;e which are
made from a greater number, and tho&s;e more compounded Ideas, are yet more
and more compounded, and more and more accompli&s;h'd and perfect. This
will give &s;ome Rea&s;on why the younger and fir&s;t Re&s;ults of the Actions of the
Soul in forming Ideas, are more &s;imple and le&s;s perfect, and from whence the
Re&s;ults of the Actions of the Soul in the elder Years, become the more com|pounded
and perfect.</P>
<P>The Soul then is the <HI>Primum movens,</HI> the &s;elf-moving Prin|ciple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soul a &s;elf-moving Principle.</NOTE> which has in it
&s;elf a Power of radiating every way <HI>in Orbem</HI> from its Center of being every
in&s;tant and for ever, and &s;o is always by means of that Radiation every where
as it were actually pre&s;ent, in every point of the Sphere of its Radiation,
though yet it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be more immediately and powerfully pre&s;ent
in the Center of its Being. It is not, I conceive, po&s;&s;ible to be truly understood
or de&s;cribed, but only by Similitude; and the be&s;t Similitude for that purpo&s;e,
I conceive, is the Sun in the great World.</P>
<P>Now if we con&s;ider the Sun in the Great World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Compared to the Sun.</NOTE> we &s;hall find it fir&s;t a Being
which has in it &s;elf a Power of radiating or di&s;per&s;ing Light into the Whole
of Nature, and (con&s;equently by this its Influence) of being as it were every
where pre&s;ent, and of being &s;en&s;ible of all tho&s;e other Bodies that are placed
any where throughout the whole <HI>Expan&s;um:</HI> For as it doth by its Radiation
influence and affect every Point of the Univer&s;e, &s;o mu&s;t there be a kind of
reflex Influence upon it &s;elf from every &s;uch Point: For as any one, and every
one Ray it &s;ends forth, does meet with and affect any Body in its way, &s;o
con&s;equently mu&s;t that End of the Ray that touches the Sun, have a greater
or le&s;s Re&s;i&s;tance to be moved forwards; and con&s;equently if there were Un|der&s;tanding
in the Sun it &s;elf, it mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that this or that Ray does &s;ome|where
in its Progre&s;s receive &s;uch or &s;uch an Impediment to its Propagation
or moving forwards that way. And be not only &s;en&s;ible, that &s;omewhere
that Ray meets with an Impediment, but it may be &s;en&s;ible al&s;o at what di|&s;tance
that Impediment or Re-action is given to its Progre&s;s: For &s;uppo&s;ing the
Re&s;i&s;tance or Re-action of all tho&s;e impeding Objects, where ever placed, to
be in them&s;elves equal, the Impediment or Re&s;i&s;tance to that End of the Ray that
is moved by the Sun, mu&s;t receive a Re&s;i&s;tance proportion'd to the nearne&s;s of
the impeding or re-acting Object; and con&s;equently the Impediment made there|by
upon the End of the Ray protruded by the Sun, mu&s;t be reciprocally pro|portionate
to the Di&s;tances of the impeding Object; and con&s;equently by the
proportion'd Re&s;i&s;tance or Re-action of the Objects, there is a manife&s;t Di&s;tin|ction
at that End of the Ray that touches the Sun, of the Di&s;tance of the Ob|ject
touched by it. Next by the number of the Rays that receive Impediment
from that Object, there is a manife&s;t Di&s;tinction of the bigne&s;s of that Object;
for if the Angle of the Cone of Rays that receive Re&s;i&s;tance from any Object,
<PB N="147" REF="184">
be actually made and has its Being at the Sun, and that the Di&s;tance of that
Re&s;i&s;tance be likewi&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hable at the Apex of it at the Sun, then is
there a Manife&s;tation or Indication at the Superficies of the Sun (by means of
this Radiation) both of the Di&s;tance of the affected of affecting Object, and of
the Angle or Magnitude of it at that di&s;tance, and not only of the Magnitude
and Di&s;tance, but of the differing nature of the Re&s;i&s;tance or Re-action of the
Object of &s;uch a bulk and &s;uch a di&s;tance, by the con&s;ecution of momentary
Impre&s;&s;ions. This I could plainly demon&s;trate by a Similitude drawn from the
Action made upon the Organ of Hearing, from which the Ear is not only in|abled
to judge of the Magnitude and Di&s;tance of the Sound, but of the Flat|ne&s;s
and Sharpne&s;s, the Mu&s;icalne&s;s and not Mu&s;icalne&s;s by the like Di&s;tinctions
in it.</P>
<P>But it may be much better explain'd by the Eye, wherein we find, that though
there be no Radiation immediately emitted by the Eye, which would make the
Reactions to the Center the &s;tronger; yet is the Eye able by the reflected Re-actions
only of Objects that are acted directly upon by the Sun, to di&s;cover the
Figure, Colour, Magnitude, Di&s;tance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of all Objects from which there
can come to it &s;elf that free Radiation. So that the Soul in the Center of the
Repo&s;itory, is &s;en&s;ible of all the Ideas placed in it, as the Eye is &s;en&s;ible of all
things that are placed before it.</P>
<P>Next, if we con&s;ider the Sun in the Great World, we &s;hall find it to be pla|ced
in the Center of a Space, all which Space, and all Bodies placed within
that Space, it does more particularly influence by an attractive Power of draw|ing
all bulky Bodies to it, or of commanding all the Motions of them; and con|&s;equently
may have fen&s;e of the Renitency of Bodies, as well as of the Motions
and Di&s;tances of each of them. So that all Bodies, more e&s;pecially within the
Sphere of its Activity, do receive a double Influence from it; fir&s;t of being
radiated, inlightned and vivified; and &s;econdly of being regulated and govern'd
in their Motions by it. And hence the Bodies &s;o placed, as they have each of
them peculiar Properties, Shapes and Motions of their own, &s;o have they al&s;o
particular Influences, Radiations, Excitations and Regulations communicated
to them from the Sun, which gives them not only their regulated Motions and
Po&s;itions, but al&s;o a kind of new Being or Activity, by which they become vi|&s;ible
and &s;en&s;ible to the re&s;t of the World, which would otherwi&s;e be dark
and in&s;en&s;ible, and vagrant here and there uncertainly in the <HI>Expan&s;um</HI> of the
Univer&s;e. So that the Soul forms to it &s;elf a Microco&s;m, or Picture of the
Macroco&s;m, in which it radiates, and is &s;en&s;ible of every thing contain'd
therein, in the &s;ame manner as the Sun in the Macroco&s;m.</P>
<P>Somewhat of this kind is the Influence of the Soul upon the Ideas placed
within the Sphere of its Radiation: And though I cannot conceive how the Soul,
which is incorporeal, &s;hould move and act upon the Ideas which are corporeal,
or how tho&s;e on the other &s;ide &s;hould by their Proprieties, Qualifications and
Motions, re-acts upon and influence the Soul; yet I am a&s;&s;ured, that &s;uch Ef|fects
are performed both by the one and the other Beings; and without them,
neither the Sen&s;ation, Cognition, Remembring, nor Ratiocination, could be per|formed;
all which are plainly the Re&s;ults of the conjunct Influences of the Soul,
and the $deas or Bodies placed within the Repo&s;itory or Sphere of its Activity.</P>
<P>Now though by what I have been &s;aying, I have endeavour'd to &s;hew that the
Soul has by its Radiation a more than ordinary and commanding Power overall
the Ideas placed within the Repo&s;itory; yet I would not be under&s;tood &s;o to limit
its Sphere of Radiation, as nor to &s;uppo&s;e that it may have a much bigger Sphere
of influencing Power, and thereby may extend it, not only to all and every Point
of the Body inlivened and pre&s;erved by it; but po&s;&s;ibly it may extend even out
of the Body, and that to &s;ome con&s;iderable Di&s;tance, and thereby not only in|fluence
other Bodies, but be influence'd by them al&s;o. And upon this account I
could produce a Multitude of Ob&s;ervations and Rea&s;ons, to prove not only the
Po&s;&s;ibility, but the Probability, nay almo&s;t Certainty of &s;uch an Influence, and
this from the Sen&s;iblene&s;s of others Ideas, <HI>Lupus in Fabula, Fa&s;cination,</HI> &amp;c.
of which po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome other time.</P>
<Q><PB N="148" REF="185">
Here our Author leaves off, nor as I can find, ever rea&s;&s;umed this Subject; and
though po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome Per&s;ons may imagine that the foregoing Explication of
the&s;e ab&s;tru&s;e Actings of the Soul it too mechanical, and tends to the making
the Soul a material Being, yet I hope the candid Reader, peru&s;ing it without
prejudice, will not find the lea&s;t Cau&s;e for &s;uch an Imputation, it being through|out
the whole Di&s;cour&s;e a&s;&s;erted and &s;hewn to be a Spiritual, Immaterial and
Self-moving Principle; and it is granted by all Men, that it both acts and is re|acted
upon by Body, only our Author &s;uppo&s;es the Pictures con&s;erving the Ideas
to be material, which I hope cannot ju&s;tly give offence: However, as I have
&s;aid in the Preface, I hold my &s;elf not in the lea&s;t obliged to defend or maintain
any of his Opinions or Di&s;cour&s;es, but fairly pre&s;ent them to the Ingenious as

very unu&s;ual one appearing in <HI>December</HI> the &s;ame Year, and the beginning of

<HEAD>THE CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<Q>At the End of the Year 1680. there appearing a very great, and indeed the
mo&s;t remarkable Comet that the Heavens have &s;hewn us in our Age, the
Author was diverted from pro&s;ecuting his Theory and Explication of
Light in the &s;everal other u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary Di&s;qui&s;itions relating to
Reftected, Inflected and Refracted Rays; though &s;omething of the two
la&s;t was formerly publi&s;h'd by him in his <HI>Micrography,</HI> p. 47, &amp; 217.
In the pre&s;ent Di&s;qui&s;ition, he does not &s;o much relate and confute the
Opinions of others (though there is &s;omething of that al&s;o) as plainly
give his own Ob&s;ervations of the Appearances, as he viewed them
through &s;everal Tele&s;copes, night after night, when he could. By the way,
I mu&s;t in all gratitude acknowledge, that the Figures relating to this
Di&s;cour&s;e were generou&s;ly communicated by the Ingenious Dr. <HI>Woodward,</HI>
who purcha&s;ed them, (put in loo&s;ely into <HI>Bayer</HI>'s <HI>Uranometria</HI>) at the
publick Auction of Dr. <HI>Hooke</HI>'s Library. Though indeed the&s;e Figures
were all very rudely de&s;igned, only as Helps to his own Memory, which the
Author him&s;elf could much better have fitted for the Graver; yet I have
endeavoured to &s;upply this Defect as well as I was able, and hope the Rea|der
will pardon the Failures. I think they pretty well an&s;wer his De&s;crip|tions,
tho&s;e being my chief Directors in perfecting the Draughts. I need
not be particular in the Contents of this Di&s;cour&s;e, the Marginal Notes
which I have added will &s;ufficiently inform the Reader: Therefore I &s;hall
only give &s;ame account of what is immediately annext to it, and which
indeed the Thread of the Di&s;cour&s;e led him to; that is, a &s;hort Treati&s;e
of <HI>Gravity:</HI> For there being a Gravitation of all Bodies to the Sun, it
&s;eemed a difficult Problem (at lea&s;t according to his Hypothe&s;is of Co|mets)
to give a rea&s;on of the Blaze or Tail's being nearly oppo&s;ite to the
Sun. We have then here annext a pretty large, and (if I may be allow|ed
to &s;peak) an ingenious Di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Gravity</HI> or <HI>Gravitation.</HI> The
<PB N="150" REF="187">
Running Title will direct the Reader to it. In this he con&s;iders the mo&s;t
known Proprieties of the Cele&s;tial Bodies, and having made &s;everal Di|ductions
from Ob&s;ervations, as to the Nature of the Aether, Air, and
the like, in which <HI>in tran&s;itu</HI> he explains Thunder and Lightning, a&s;&s;ert|ing
a Levitation, as well as Gravitation (or a receding from as well as
tendenc$ towards the $word$) having al&s;o &s;hewn that the Aether or va&s;t
fluid <HI>Expan&s;um</HI> is the <HI>Medium</HI> $word$ convey the Motions of Gravitation as
well as Light; he comes in the next place to treat more particularly of <HI>Bo|dy</HI>
and <HI>Motion,</HI> explaining what he under&s;tands by each of them, and then
treating of Motion, &s;ays, that the two great Laws of Motion are <HI>Light</HI>
and <HI>Gravity,</HI> and having before treated of the former, he comes to ex|plain
the latter more particularly, when having &s;hewn that there is &s;uch a
thing as Gravity, with the Limits and Proportions of its Power, and
that it exerts it in all Bodies, he comes at la&s;t to the Principal Part, the
<HI>Cau&s;e of Gravity,</HI> and after the Enumeration of its Proprieties, gives
his <HI>Explication</HI> and <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> of the Cau&s;e thereof. The Author de|&s;igned
to have an&s;wered &s;everal Objections again&s;t this his Hypothe&s;is,
but having reply'd to one only, the Di&s;cour&s;e ends. To &s;upply this Defect,
I have added &s;ome Fragments which I found relating to the &s;ame Subject,

and Proprieties of <HI>Light,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Introducti|on to the fol|lowing Di&s;cour&s;e of Comets.</NOTE> and have therein explain'd &s;ome of the mo&s;t
wonderful Qualifications thereof. I &s;hould have proceeded farther in that
Di&s;qui&s;ition, after another Method than what I now take, had I not been
diverted by an extraordinary and unu&s;ual Light, which &s;ince offer'd it &s;elf to
my view, and exacted a more nice Ob&s;ervation and Contemplation upon it;
and that was the Comet in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t. This new appearing <HI>Light</HI> cau&s;ed me
&s;ooner to fall upon the Contemplation of this Subject, than according to my
<HI>intended Method</HI> I &s;hould have done, tho' I de&s;igned to have come to it hereafter
in its due Place and Order, wherein I de&s;ign'd al&s;o to have given an account of
what I ob&s;erved concerning tho&s;e of 1680 and 1682.</P>
<P>THO' the Frequency of <HI>Comets,</HI> and &s;ome of them very con&s;iderable, has
excited the Lovers of A&s;tronomical Learning to &s;earch and find out what
they are; yet I have not hitherto met with any (tho' I have &s;een and peru&s;ed
the <HI>Theorys</HI> publi&s;hed by very many Ingenious Men) that has given &s;uch an
account of them, as to me &s;eems natural and &s;atisfactory. For tho' the&s;e Bodies
&s;eem very heterogeneous, &s;ingular, and of a di&s;tinct Nature from all the re&s;t of
the Cele&s;tial Bodies we contemplate, yet I am very apt to believe, that when|ever
we attain a true Knowledge of them, we &s;hall find them to be the Pro|duct
of the &s;ame regular Cour&s;e of Nature. 'Tis true our Knowledge, even
of the mo&s;t con&s;picuous, is very imperfect, and not brought to the utmo&s;t Per|fection
of Improvement that the Helps which Nature has afforded us may &s;eem
to require; tho' even then we &s;hall be to &s;eek after divers other Proprieties of
them, which are by other Helps afforded to the Inquiry after the Qualification
of terre&s;trial Bodies. For whereas we have for the Examination of Terre&s;trial
Bodies all the Five Sen&s;es, for tho&s;e of the Heavens we have but Two at mo&s;t,
or indeed (the Information of the &s;econd being &s;o very little) but one; and
that is the Sight, the other, <HI>viz.</HI> that of Feeling, being &s;o very little, that 'tis
almo&s;t incon&s;iderable in all, except the Sun. This may be argued from the Ex|periments
<PB N="151" REF="188">
that have been made to find whether the Rays of the Moon convey
any Heat, by the help of Burning gla&s;&s;es, whereby tho' the &s;aid Rays have
conden&s;ed the Beams above 500 times, and con&s;equently augment their Power
accordingly, yet I could never find the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible Alteration as to the heating
or cooling Quality of them; and this try'd, not only by ca&s;ting them on the
back of the Hand, as on a Part of the Body very &s;en&s;ible, but by throwing them
upon the Ball of a Thermometer made with Air, which would be rarify'd with
the lea&s;t degree of increa&s;ed Heat, and conden&s;ed with the lea&s;t degree of Cold.
Whence we may very rationally conclude, that if the Alterations of Heat and
Cold cau&s;ed by the Rays of the Moon, when full and wholly inlightned, be &s;o
very in&s;en&s;ible and incon&s;iderable, certainly the Influence of the other Planets,
as to the Alterations of Heat and Cold, mu&s;t needs be very much le&s;s: For if
the Sun's Light reflected from a whole Hemi&s;phere of the Moon, which is fir&s;t
abundantly more near to us than any of the other Cele&s;tial Bodies, and &s;o ap|pears
an illuminated <HI>Area,</HI> which is bigger than the <HI>Areas</HI> of all the other Ce|le&s;tial
Bodies put together, both Fixed Stars and Planets, does produce no &s;en|&s;ible
Alterations as to the Degrees of Heat and Cold, how much more in&s;en&s;ible
mu&s;t the Alterations be which are cau&s;ed by &s;ome other Body, which alters not
in its Light a 10000 part of the Light of the Moon, as tho&s;e Alterations of
the other Planets will be found to be upon &s;trict Examination? Next, if the
Reflection of the Sun's Light from a Body &s;o near us as the Moon is, in com|pari&s;on
of the other Planets, works no &s;en&s;ible effect, how much le&s;s effect mu&s;t
the other Planets produce, which are va&s;tly much farther from us. Again, if
the Reflection from the Moon, who&s;e Di&s;tance from the Sun is much the &s;ame
with that of the Earth, produces no effect, how much le&s;s &s;ignificant mu&s;t be
the Reflection from <HI>Saturn, Mars</HI> and <HI>Jupiter</HI> be, which in the neare&s;t Approach
to the Sun are much further off from the Body of the Sun, than ever the Moon
can be. So that upon the whole, we may conclude, that tho' it cannot be de|nied,
but that the Cele&s;tial Bodies may have &s;ome kind of power and effect in
the Alterations of Heat and Cold, yet compared to the Influence which the Sun
hath in that Particular, it may be &s;aid to be almo&s;t nothing, or at lea&s;t wholly
in&s;en&s;ible. I do not &s;ay that the Fixed Stars and other Planets, be&s;ides the Sun
and Moon, are wholly in&s;ignificant, or without effect, as to the Body of the
Earth; for that, as I &s;hall in another place &s;hew, they may and have all &s;ome
Influence; but to be found out by other <HI>Media</HI> than the immediate Sen&s;es. But
as to &s;en&s;ible Effects, as to Heat and Cold, I conceive them &s;o &s;ubtle and curi|ous,
as not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the more gro&s;s Organs of our Sen&s;e in any of
the Planets, nay of the Moon it &s;elf, &s;ave only of tho&s;e of the Sun.</P>
<P>So then the Sight being the chiefe&s;t Sen&s;e that can inform us concerning the
Nature of Cele&s;tial Bodies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the Sight informs us as to Comets.</NOTE> we may next con&s;ider what kind of Information
concerning the Nature of Comets this Sen&s;e can afford us, and &s;ee whether we
can find in all or any of the Authors that have yet written of them, &s;o full an
Account as for this purpo&s;e were very de&s;irable, and, as I conceive, might, if
care had been accordingly taken, without much difficulty have been attained.
For my own part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, tho' I have read and examined a great many,
and con&s;ider'd and compar'd them together, to find An&s;wers to tho&s;e Que&s;tions
I propounded to my &s;elf concerning them; yet I was &s;o far by this means
from procuring to my &s;elf a &s;atisfactory An&s;wer to them, that I was more to
&s;eek after this my Enquiry, than I was before: For I found the Accounts of &s;e|veral
Hi&s;torians concerning them &s;o very different one from another in mo&s;t things,
that I knew not which to rely upon. Which I &s;uppo&s;e might be cau&s;ed, either
from their differing way of ob&s;erving, or from the difference of the goodne&s;s
of their Sight, or for the mo&s;t part from the differing Hypothe&s;es they had made
to them&s;elves, or been prepo&s;&s;e&s;t withal from the Writings or Doctrines of
other Men. 'Twas a longtime that the Opinion prevailed in this Part of the
World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Accounts in Authors &s;atisfactory, and why.</NOTE> that they were nothing but &s;ublunary Meteors to&s;&s;ed and blown to and
fro by the Winds or Motions of the &s;uperior Regions of the Air, and the Accounts
we find given of them by Men of that Per&s;ua&s;ion to be very &s;uitable to that Suppo|&s;ition.
So that for all the time that the <HI>Peripatetick</HI> Philo&s;ophy and the <HI>Ptolomean</HI>
A&s;tronomy prevailed, all the Accounts concerning them are idle and in&s;ignificant
to this purpo&s;e, and &s;eem only &s;uited to the U&s;e which they de&s;igned for them,
<PB N="152" REF="189">
which was to make them only as Me&s;&s;engers, to foretel, by the help of their
own Chimeras and Fancies joined with them, what Alterations were like to
happen in human Affairs, and thence I doubt not, proceeded the &s;trange Shapes
of them which they have painted out unto us of Targets, Shields, Spears,
and Daggers, with Hands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Dragons and Serpents, and &s;uch like. A
great variety of which kind of Figures you may find in Authors that have
written concerning them; and you may &s;ee a great many of them together in
<HI>Hevelius</HI>'s <HI>Cometagraphy,</HI> mo&s;t of which, I confe&s;s, I look upon only as the Pro|ducts
of a prejudicate and prepo&s;&s;e&s;t Poetick Fancy in the Hi&s;torians: For of
tho&s;e five which I have ob&s;erved, I could not ob&s;erve any thing like them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Appearan|ces different from what they make 'em.</NOTE> no
more than I could any of tho&s;e Figures of them which are delivered to us by
the &s;aid <HI>Hevelius,</HI> as Ob&s;ervations of his own: For the Figures of them, which
I ob&s;erved both with my naked Eye, and with the be&s;t Tele&s;copes I had (&s;ome
of which I am &s;ure were very good) I found the Appearances of them much of
another kind. And of the&s;e Figures I was not a&s;&s;ured by the Appearances of one or
a few Ob&s;ervations, but by the Repetitions of them &s;ome hundreds of times, and
by changing the Po&s;ition of the Tube, Apertures, Eye gla&s;&s;es, Po&s;ture of my
Head, and the viewing of them with the Right Eye, and &s;ometimes with the
Left, that if tho&s;e Appearances had been cau&s;ed by any thing peculiar either
in the Gla&s;&s;es or the Eyes, I might have found them out. And le&s;t &s;omewhat
in the Air or Atmo&s;phere might cau&s;e them, I examined them when at a good
hight above the Horizon, and continued ever now and then to ob&s;erve them,
even to the very &s;etting of them at the Horizon; in all which Ob&s;ervations I
plainly &s;aw and took notice of the true appearing Figure and Shape thereof.
Wherefore this imperfect and differing Account I found concerning Comets,
made me re&s;olve to throw a&s;ide all manner of Hypothe&s;es concerning them&punc;
and to ob&s;erve them as if there never had been any &s;uch Appearance before&punc;
and to attend wholly to what the Appearances them&s;elves would teach me:
And this I have done in every one that I have yet ob&s;erved;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author's Candidne&s;s in Philo&s;ophical Matters a&s;|&s;erted.</NOTE> for tho' I have al|ready
publi&s;hed my Conjectures, which were grounded upon tho&s;e Ob&s;ervarions
I had made on the three preceding Comets, yet I did not at all confine my &s;elf to
be of that Opinion, or nor to &s;eek farther to inform my Judgment by other Ap|pearances
I &s;hould happen to ob&s;erve in my future Trials; nor &s;hould that at
all have prevailed with me to defend a former Conjecture, that I had owned
&s;uch an Opinion to the World, and had brought &s;everal Arguments to make
it more probable, fetch'd from other collateral Agreements in the Operations
of Nature. For in things of this nature, where the Informations are but few,
and at be&s;t but imperfect, and where a little unheeded Circum&s;tance may be of
great importance in determining the Significancy of it, and where there is
oftentimes &s;o great a Similitude between the Effects produced by Cau&s;es and
preceding Circum&s;tances va&s;tly differing, 'twould be a high Piece of Arrogance
and over valuing ones own Judgment po&s;itively to a&s;&s;ert the true Cau&s;e of &s;uch
appearing Effects to be this or that, and not another. And therefore as in the
former, &s;o in this, what I deliver as my Opinion, I would have no farther to
be rely'd on than as the Re&s;ult of my Ratiocination and conjecturing from the
be&s;t Information I could hitherto obtain; only I do po&s;itively affirm, that the
Ob&s;ervations I here &s;hall mention were made with all the Care I could, and that
the Appearances to me were &s;uch as I here expre&s;s them; and that I do verily
believe that there was no kind of Fallacy in them, but that any other Per&s;ons might
have &s;een the &s;ame, had they $eedfully attended what they &s;aw; which to do,
nothing is more advantageous than the pre&s;ent de&s;igning and drawing what is
&s;een, and writing a De&s;cription thereof. Now tho' I did in this Enquiry throw
off all Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of other Hypothe&s;es, &s;o as not to be bia&s;s'd by them, yet
was I not &s;o unmindful of them, as not to make &s;ome good u&s;e of them; and
that was, to con&s;ider them as propounded by their &s;everal Authors, and thence
by Synthetical Ratiocination to conclude what the Appearances ought to be, if
&s;uch or &s;uch an Hypothe&s;is were true, and con&s;onant to the thing it &s;elf, and
thereupon to examine whether any &s;uch Appearance could be di&s;covered. To
this end I con&s;ider'd tho&s;e of <HI>Galileo, Hevelius,</HI> and divers others, who ex|plain
the Blaze or Tail by the Light of the Sun, refracted in the Head, and &s;o
con&s;tipated into a Stream, to make the Appearance of that light Emanation
<PB N="153" REF="190">
which is on the Side oppo&s;ite to the Sun; and putting &s;uch Suppo&s;itions, as if
real, I deduced what mu&s;t probably then be the Appearances that would follow
from them; and then making Observations a fre&s;h, I inquired whether I could
di&s;cover any Appearances that would favour &s;uch or &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition&punc; But
upon the whole, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, I found no one Remark that did any ways in|cline
me to be of &s;uch Opinions, though I had many that for the pre&s;ent convinc'd
me, that the Blaze mu&s;t needs proceed from &s;ome other Cau&s;e. It would be
too long to recount here the &s;everal Hypothe&s;es&punc; I did for this purpo&s;e con&s;ider,
and the particular Remarks I made to &s;atisfy my &s;elf concerning them, that
they were not in &s;uch Particulars agreeable to the Theory &s;uppo&s;ed: And there|fore
I &s;hall rather give an account what the Particulars were which I my &s;elf
did ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>My Ob&s;ervations of the fir&s;t, which appeared in <HI>November</HI> 1680, were but
few, having the opportunity but of two Mornings to &s;ee it, which were the 22d
and 23d of the &s;aid Month; at which times being in the dawning Light of the
Morning, and the Air above not &s;o clear, I could not make any certain Deter|mination
of its Place, but by comparing its Po&s;ition with the Stars that ap|peared
near it, of the greater Magnitude: For on Monday Morning, <HI>Nov.</HI> 22d
1680, at half an hour after 6 a Clock, it was almo&s;t in the Line that pa&s;t
through <HI>Spica Virginis</HI> and <HI>Cor Leonis,</HI> but not full &s;o much toward the South;
and its Di&s;tance from <HI>Spica,</HI> as near as I could judge by my Sight, for I had
then no In&s;trument ready, was very near the &s;ame with that of <HI>Algorab</HI> in the
Right Wing of <HI>Corvus,</HI> or rather &s;omewhat more. Whence (by the Globe) I
conceive it was about 3 $ Degrees enter'd into <HI>Scorpio,</HI> and about 3&frac12; Degrees
South of the Ecliptick. Its Blaze was but &s;hort, but pointed towards <HI>Spica
Virginis,</HI> not directly, but a very little on the South of it. It reached more
than half way towards it, and &s;ometimes by Glances it would &s;eem of the
whole length almo&s;t. Its Appearance was but &s;aint&punc; as was al&s;o that of the
Head, which though it &s;eemed bigger than any Star of the fir&s;t Magnitude, yet
it had but a $aint, hazy and duski&s;h Light, like the Appearance of a Star of the
fir&s;t Magnitude, through a hazy or foggy Air. I then viewed it with a &s;ix-foot
Tele&s;cope, and found the Head of it to appear very large, but very feint, and
though it were con&s;iderably brighter in the middle, yet the <HI>Nucleus</HI> thereof was
not &s;o defined as I had &s;een &s;ome of the former, but &s;eemed inveloped in a
Cloud or Fog, not well defined. The Hazine&s;s about which &s;omewhat brighter
Middle part, was pretty well defined, and round towards the Sun; but the other
part &s;eemed to &s;pread parabolically, or rather hyperbollically, from the Sun.
The dawning Light increa&s;ing apace, and the Air thickning, I had not long to
ob&s;erve it; however I followed it as long as I could, till it appeared but like a
faint hazy Star with little or no Tail.</P>
<P>The next Morning, which was the 23d, I &s;aw it again; but it was got much
farther into the dawning Light of the Morning, and $he Air was much more ha|zy:
It was then got to the South-Ea&s;t of <HI>La$x Librae,</HI> and by placing it ac|cording
to its Po&s;ition to tho&s;e Stars I could &s;ee, I judged it to be removed more
Ea&s;tward about 4 or 5 Degrees, than it was the preceding Morning and I con|ceived
it to move pretty near in a Parallel with the Ecliptick or rather to be
got &s;omewhat more Southward. The Appearance through $he &s;ix foot Tele|&s;cope
was much the &s;ame with that I &s;aw the Morning before&punc; and the time be|ing
very &s;hort, the Air thickning, and the Light increa&s;ing, I could add no more
Remarks, hoping &s;ome other clear Morning would better accommod$$$ me;
but though I attended, yet I could not from that time &s;ee it again&punc; Though by
others I find it was ob&s;erved a good while before, and by other$ &s;everal days
$span$
half an hour after Five in the Morning, and by its Di&s;tances from <HI>C$$</HI> and <HI>Ca$d$
Leonis,</HI> taken with an In&s;trument of four Foot and a half Radius, he found it
then, as he &s;ays, in 12 Degrees of <HI>Virgo,</HI> and in two Degrees of North Lati|titude,
with a &s;low Motion, having not pa&s;&s;ed above four Degrees in three
days. Its Tail was then about 30 Degrees long. Sig$ <HI>$span$</HI> in
<HI>Italy,</HI> on the 19th of <HI>November,</HI> $span$ at 4 Degrees di&s;tance from <HI>Spica Vir|ginis,</HI>
and about the &s;ame Latitude with that S$ar. He judged $word$ in 23 of
<HI>Libra,</HI> with about one Degree and half of South $word$: Its Tail directed
<PB N="154" REF="191">
towards <HI>Spica,</HI> not directly, but a little to the Southwards of it. Its Head ap|peared
as big as a Star of the fir&s;t Magnitude, but of a dusky Light, and pale
like a <HI>Stella Nebulo&s;a:</HI> Its Tail was very &s;hort, and reached not much more,
than two Degree towards <HI>Spica.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards viewing it with a Tele&s;cope 17 <HI>Venetian</HI> Feet in length, he &s;aw
the Head of it three times a big as that of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which was &s;een that Night,
only its Figure was not &s;o well and round defined, but of a &s;moaky dusky Co|lour
which cau&s;ed &s;everal of tho&s;e that viewed it to differ &s;omewhat in their
Judgments about this Mea&s;ure: And (he &s;ays) that one thing was very remark|able,
that he could not in this &s;ee any di&s;tinct round <HI>Nucleus</HI> more &s;hining than
the re&s;t of the Head, as was plain to be di&s;covered in those of 1664 and 1665,
wherein they were pretty clear, and not without a roundi&s;h Termination. But in
this the Light was con&s;iderably greater in the middle than toward the Extremes,
but without any certain Boundary, whence it had more the re&s;emblance of a little
illuminated Cloud, than of any thing el&s;e, illuminated but with a dusky Light.
This he re&s;embles to the Appearance of Smoak i&s;&s;uing out of a Chimny or
Furnace, wherein there is a great Fire, when &s;een at &s;ome di&s;tance in the Night;
for there the Smoak &s;eems to be a kind of Flame tapering to &s;ome di&s;tance, and
there to vani&s;h. <HI>Note, the Latitude of</HI> Venice is 45&deg;. $7'.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t it was di&s;tant from <HI>Spica Virginis</HI> 8&deg;. 28'. the 22d in the Morning
13&deg;, 10'. the 23rd he could not &s;ee it for Clouds; the 24th it was di&s;tant 23&deg;. 30.'
the 25th it was di&s;tant 28&deg;. 13.' From which Ob&s;ervations he concludes its
Longitudes to be, the 21&s;t in 27&deg;. 51'. of $; the 22d in $word$. 2&deg;, 33'. the 24th in
$word$ 12&deg;. 52.' the 25th $word$ 17&deg;. 45'. Its Latitude was South, and it moved al|mo&s;t
parallel to the Ecliptick, and &s;eemed to tend towards the Sun, &s;o as he ho|ped
it might be &s;een to pa&s;s through, or eclip&s;e the Sun: And the &s;traight Line
from the Comet through <HI>Spica Virginis,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed very near <HI>Cor Leonis</HI> all the
times the &s;aw it. Comparing the Spaces that it pa&s;&s;ed the &s;everal Days which he
&s;aw it one with another, he found it to accelerate in its Motion; for between
that of the 21&s;t and 22d, it pa&s;&s;ed but 4&deg;. 42'. whereas in the next two Days it
had pa&s;&s;ed 10&deg; 19&deg;. So that he &s;uppo&s;ed its greate&s;t Acceleration would be
pretty near its Conjunction with the Sun, which would be on the 28th of the
&s;ame Month; and thence he conceived it might re&punc; appear, after it had pa&s;t the
Sun in the Evenings, and be &s;een for a good while. Which whether it did or
not, I cannot learn from any Place &s;ince that time, for I find no mention of any
Comet till the 10th of <HI>December</HI> following,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;ervations of the great Co|met in <HI>December</HI> 1680.</NOTE> when the Tail of a Comet was &s;een
to ri&s;e out of the We&s;t South-We&s;t, above the Horizon, to a great length, by
&s;ome it <HI>Oxford.</HI> And Dr. <HI>Wallis,</HI> at the &s;ame Place the Night following, be|ing
the 11th of the <HI>December</HI> about &s;even of the Clock at Night, &s;aw the Tail of it
very bright and long, which he judged to be about three quarters of a Qua|drant
but narrow upwards; the Head of it he judged, by the Po&s;ition of the
Tail, to be about the Head of <HI>Sagittary,</HI> the Point reached a high as the <HI>Swan,</HI>
but &s;omewhat to the Ea&s;tward of the bright Star therein, pointing towards the
Con&s;tellation of <HI>Per&s;eus,</HI> from which time forward it was continually ob&s;er|ved.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether $word$ were the same with the former $word$ No|vember.</NOTE>
Some are of opinion, that this was the &s;econd Appearance of the &s;ame
Come$ after it had past the Sun, though there are more of the contrary Opini|on
and &s;uppo&s;e them to be two differing Comets, and that becau&s;e of the diffe|ring
Tendency of both their Motions: The Comet of <HI>N$vember</HI> daily increa&s;ing
its Latitude to the South, as &s;everal of the Ob&s;ervators make it; but other Ob|servations
make it to be at its greate&s;t south Latitude on the 23d or 24th of
<HI>November,</HI> and that from that time, till it di&s;appeared, its Latitude continually
dimini&s;hed. But which of the two ob&s;erved be&s;t, I know not; but &s;ure I am,
that the Ob&s;ervations I have hitherto met with of it, are &s;o uncertain, that 'twill
be hard to &s;ay which of them is right. However,<NOTE PLACE="marg">NB. This the Author never performed.</NOTE> &s;omewhat more concerning
this matter &s;hall be added hereafter, when I came to &s;peak of the Motions of
Comets in general; for however &s;trange the differing Observations of &s;everal
Men, who po&s;&s;ibly may not be &s;ufficiently skilful to make the Ob&s;ervations,
and of others who though they may have Skill enough, may yet want fitting
In&s;truments for that purpo&s;e; yet by all that I have ob&s;rved my &s;elf, and by
what I have found in the Observations of Learned A&s;tronomers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nature of all Com$$$ the &s;ame.</NOTE> I conceive they

and for the mo&s;t part agree in their other Affections and Proprieties. I
&s;hall therefore, by rea&s;on that all the Ob&s;ervations I meet with of this fir&s;t are
but very few, and &s;carce any one that may certainly be rely'd on, rather $eave
any further Di&s;quition upon this, and proceed to the Ob&s;ervations and Appear|ances
of the 2d, the Blaze of which, as I &s;ay, began, to be &s;een the 10th of
<HI>December</HI> 1680, ri&s;ing up above the Horizon, and on the 11th was &s;een by Dr.
<HI>Wallis</HI> at Oxford to ri&s;e above the Horizon &s;o high as the <HI>Swan,</HI> and was con|ceived
to come from a Head below the Horizon in &s;ome part of the Heaven near
the Head of <HI>Sagittarius.</HI> I find al&s;o by Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI>'s Relation of the Comet,
that Mr. <HI>Flam&s;tead</HI> at <HI>Greenwich</HI> &s;aw the Tail of it on the 10th and 11th, a little
after the Setting of the Sun, and took notice, that on the 10th it pa&s;&s;ed through
the middle of the Con&s;tellation of the <HI>Eagle,</HI> and terminated at 3 Stars mark'd
by <HI>Bayer</HI> with <HI>A w</HI> and <HI>b,</HI> and that on the 11th the Tail extended to the extre|mity
of the Dart. The 12th he &s;aw the Head of it at 4 of the Clock and 40
Minutes, in 5 deg. 9 min of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> with 9 degrees and 4 Minutes of North
Latitude. The &s;ame day Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> &s;aw the Tail of it ri&s;ing above the Cloud 9
near the Horizon, and appearing bent like a piece of a Rainbow; who&s;e Convexity,
which was &s;en&s;ible, re&s;pected the South: It &s;eem'd terminated with two Circles
concentrick to each other: At 24&frac12; Minutes after Five, he &s;aw the Head 4&frac12; de|grees
high, in the &s;ame Verical with <HI>Aquila.</HI> The Tail ro&s;e, oblique to the
Vertical, declining towards the North; &s;o that the 3 stars of the <HI>Eagle,</HI> which
are in a right Line, were as much to the South of it, as they were di&s;tance one
from another; and it pa&s;t by the mo&s;t We&s;tern Stars of the <HI>Dart,</HI> and tended
towards the Tail of <HI>Cygnus:</HI> It ended at the Milky Way, and was of a pale
Gold Colour. The Length of it was about 40 degrees. From that time it con|tinued
to be ob&s;erved almo&s;t every Night &s;omewhere or other, as I find by com|paring
the &s;everal Accounts of it which I have &s;een; but mo&s;t of the Ob&s;erva|tions
are &s;o imperfect, that nothing certain can be built upon them. I &s;hall
therefore pa&s;s them by, and only take notice of tho&s;e of Mr. <HI>Cassini,</HI> made at the
<HI>Ob&s;ervatoire</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> and only &s;uch Ob&s;ervations of his as are Phy&s;ical, omitting
at pre&s;ent tho&s;e which are purely A&s;tronomical, and &s;hew the Place and Motion
of it, which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to u&s;e hereafter, when I &s;hall al&s;o take notice
of the like Ob&s;ervations made here by Mr. <HI>Flam&s;tead.</HI></P>
<P>The 17th of <HI>December</HI> I find that Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> viewed the Head of it with the
Tele&s;cope of his Quadrant,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI>'s Phy|&s;ical Ob&s;erva|tions,</NOTE> but found the bigne&s;s of the <HI>Nucleus</HI> not to exceed
the bigne&s;s of a Star of the 3d Magnitude to the naked Eye; not of a deter|minate
Figure, but confu&s;ed and irregular; and ob&s;erving it through a Tele|&s;cope
of 35 Foot, it appeared of the bigne&s;s of the Ball of <HI>Saturn,</HI> but confu|&s;ed
al&s;o and irregular, which he a&s;cribes to the Vapors near the Horizon which
encompa&s;&s;ed it, for that the Bodies of the Planets near the Horizon are &s;o con|fu&s;ed
likewi&s;e. The Length of the Tail he judged 48 Degrees.</P>
<P>I &s;aw it &s;everal times between the 18th and 19th Days of <HI>December,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author's own Ob&s;erva|tions. Plate 2. Fig. 1.</NOTE> but in Places
where I had no Convenience of making any good Ob&s;ervations of it $ but the 29th
at 7 in the Evening, I view'd the Head with a 14 Foot Tele&s;cope, and found it of this
Form: There was a hazy Brightne&s;s, which &s;eem'd through the Tele&s;cope about half
a Degree in Magnitude, or as big as the Moon would appear to the naked Eye.
This was fainte$ and fainter, as it was farther from the middle, but no where
certainly defined; yet the half of it, which re&s;pected the Sun, was pretty round,
and beyond that the Sky was dark and clear, without any Light: Toward the
middle it grew lighter and lighter, and about a 6th or 8th part of it was pretty
near of an equal Degree of Light, not defined any way, but &s;omewhat like a
whiter part of a Cloud: Out of this there was plainly to be &s;een a kind of
Stream i&s;&s;uing out, not directly oppo&s;ite to the half round Part, but a little to
the Northward of a brighter &s;mall Stream, which pa&s;&s;ed through the re&s;t of the
Head into the Blaze; and though it &s;eem'd to i&s;&s;ue out of it toward the
North Pole, yet it &s;uddenly bent into the middle of the Blaze, and a&s;cended a
good way into it like a Pit$. The half-round part al&s;o towards the Edges of it,
&s;truck into the Tail, making the Out&s;ides of the Tail or Blaze both brighter than
the re&s;t of the Blaze, except the Pith: The&s;e were a little diverging upwards,
and &s;o bounded the Sides of the Blaze. The Stream out of the middle, as it ap|pear'd
through the Tele&s;cope, &s;eemed as if there had been a brighter Stream of
<PB N="156" REF="194">
&s;ome more &s;hining Matter that had i&s;&s;ued out of it, not perpendicularly, but
a little inclined to the Right Hand, and imitated a Stream of Water, i$ it had
run out of a Ve&s;&s;el a little inclined to the Perpendicular: For it bent quickly in|to
the Axis of the Blaze. This is repre&s;ented in the Figure by the bright Part
i&s;&s;uing from the round <HI>Nucleus, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</HI> This appeared &s;ometimes more plain and
&s;ometimes more faint, &s;o as &s;ometimes to be much like the re&s;t of the Blaze:
But for the mo&s;t part, &s;o much of the Hea$ as I could &s;ee at once, was brighte&s;t
of all in the middle, and then brighter on the Edges than the re&s;t of the Blaze.
Its Blaze or Tail then extended to a very great Length and Breadth, and ended
between the two Stars in <HI>Per&s;eus</HI> marked by <HI>Bayer</HI> with <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. At fir&s;t it &s;eem|ed
to turn off at <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> on the Right Hand, or towards the North; but as the
Evening grew darker, I plainly &s;aw it to reach the Stars <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. As concerning
its Place at that time, and the tendency of its Tail as to the Sun, we &s;hall &s;peak of
them hereafter in their due Places: For I &s;hall now only mention to you what I
ob&s;erved in its Shape and Appearance.</P>
<P><HI>December</HI> the 30th, at half an hour after 8, I ob&s;erved the Comet both with
my naked Eye, and with a Gla&s;s of &s;ix Foot: Its <HI>Nucleus</HI> was hardly di&s;tingui&s;h|able,
only there was a cloudy Whitene&s;s in the middle, with a hazy Light about
it, which by degrees grew fainter and fainter; but &s;till it was more defined to|wards
the Sun, yet as before very imperfectly, though the outermo&s;t Edge had
&s;omewhat con&s;iderably more light than the Sky, and had a rounding like a
Cloud. This Hazine&s;s &s;pread from the Head on that Side that was oppo&s;ite to
the Sun, &s;omewhat like a Parabolick Figure, and made up the Blaze or Tail;
but the Head was con&s;iderably lighter than the Blaze. Looking often upon it,
and diligently inquiring, and remarking what I could di&s;cover, I &s;aw the &s;ame
Stream of Light i&s;&s;ue out of the <HI>Nucleus</HI> as I had the $ight before, and this in
the manner of a &s;udden Spouting of Water out of an Engine to quench Fire,
which would pre&s;ently again di&s;appear, and be much like the re&s;t of the Blaze.
The&s;e Dartings I could perceive to ri&s;e to a con&s;iderable height into the Blaze or
Tail. I often &s;aw the Tele&s;copical Stars through the Blaze, and this Night I
ob&s;erved one almo&s;t up to the very Hazine&s;s about the Head of the Comet, ap|pear
through the Blaze. After I had di&s;covered this i&s;&s;uing of Light through
the Tele&s;cope, I diligently attended the Appearance of the Comet with my naked
Eye, and I could plainly perceive &s;uch a kind of Darting of Light from the Head,
which did &s;ometimes &s;eem to dart almo&s;t the whole Length of the Blaze or
Tail, which I have &s;ome hundreds of times &s;ince taken notice of.</P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 5. I hoped to have &s;een it eclip&s;e <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of <HI>Pega&s;us</HI> in <HI>Bayer;</HI> but it pa&s;&s;ed
very near it, but mi&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 7. I ob&s;erved it about 11 a Clock at Night, I could not &s;ee the Length
of the Blaze for the Clouds. It tended towards <HI>Per&s;eus,</HI> but &s;eemed not to
reach it. It was grown vary faint, and &s;eemed much wa&s;ted. It was very &s;trange
that there appeared little or no Halo or Atmo&s;phere about the Head on that Side
that re&s;pected the Sun; but the Parabolick Edge &s;eemed to touch the very <HI>Nu|cleus</HI>
or light Cloud in the middle. The brighter Dartings out of Light at &s;ome|times
more than at others, now $word$ appeared; and I was then a&s;&s;ured by
above 20 &s;everal times taking notice of it, and examining it with all imaginable
care through my 14 Foot Tele&s;cope, that the&s;e Appearances were no Optical
Fallacies. I thought the $span$ the Air might have been &s;ome way a
Cau&s;e of this Appearance; but $span$ I &s;hould have di&s;covered &s;ome &s;uch thing
in the Fixed Stars, which yet I could not&punc; And therefore I judge it a true and real
Appearance of the Mutation in the Comet it fell, how in&s;tantaneous &s;oever it
appeared&punc; of which I &s;hall &s;hew more in my following Ob&s;ervations&punc; I this
Night al&s;o took notice of the Stream, as before, i&s;&s;uing out of the <HI>Nucleus</HI> into
the Blaze, with a brighter Pith of Axis of Light, and it seemed $span$ in the
&s;ame manner as before$ by &s;purts, and then as &s;uddenly di&s;appearing. The $span$
were neither cau&s;ed by the Eye; for I &s;aw it both with the $span$
the Left Eye, and with &s;everal Inclinations of my Head, and &s;o altering the Po|&s;tures
of each of them, I turned the Tele&s;cope, and varied the Gla&s;&s;es and Aper|tures,
to &s;ee if any of the&s;e would make them not to appear, or a$ter any $word$
them; but I found them in every Trial, and therefore they mu&s;t be cau&s;ed by $
real Effect in the Object i$ &s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="195">
<HI>Jan.</HI> 9th, from 9 till 12, I ob&s;erved the Places, Motions, Po&s;itions and Ap|pearances
of the Comet. The Places of it I &s;hall not mention here. The Blaze
of it was &s;ometimes pretty clear and bright, e&s;pecially about the Girdle of <HI>An|dromeda;</HI>
which was ju&s;t within the Rays to the naked Eye, but through the
Tele&s;cope it was &s;ometimes clear of them, though &s;ometimes in the Gla&s;s al&s;o
it was manife&s;tly within them: They &s;pread al&s;o &s;o wide upwards, as to touch the
Foot of <HI>Andromeda,</HI> a little beyond which they &s;eem'd to terminate, though at
other times they reacht even to <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of <HI>Per&s;eus</HI> in <HI>Bayer,</HI> &s;o that <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> &s;eem'd to be
in the very middle or Axis of the Blaze. This Night again, as I had &s;everal
Nights before, I very often ob&s;erved the &s;udden Radiations or Fla&s;hings from
the <HI>Nucleus,</HI> but e&s;pecially in the middle of the Pith or Blaze. It was exceeding
wonderful, and, all things con&s;ider'd, it &s;eems very difficult to be explained from
what Cau&s;e, or by what means it was effected. I oftentimes ob&s;erved the Head
with very little Radiations, and then upon a &s;udden a bright Stream i&s;&s;ued from
the <HI>Nucleus</HI> or light Cloud in the middle, and a&s;cended into the Blaze, &s;ome|times
&s;traight up from the middle, and almo&s;t as big as the <HI>Nucleus,</HI> and would
&s;hoot &s;ometimes to a good di&s;tance from the Head into the Blaze, which I di&s;|cover'd
by viewing a part of the Blaze at a pretty di&s;tance from the Head, with
the Tele&s;cope, without &s;eeing the Head it &s;elf. Sometimes it would i&s;&s;ue from
one &s;ide, and &s;ometimes from another, and &s;o &s;hoot upwards into the Pith of
the Blaze. Sometimes it would be di&s;per&s;ed, as it were, into a broad Light,
and undefined, whil&s;t the other a&s;cended &s;traight, and defined; and that al&s;o
&s;ometimes on one &s;ide, &s;ometimes on the other, and &s;eemed &s;omewhat like the
flaring of the Flame of a Candle or Torch. The&s;e Appearances I am farther
certain were not cau&s;ed by my Eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Appear|ances were real.</NOTE> or by the Gla&s;&s;es of the Tele&s;cope, or by
the Alterations of the Air: Not by my Eye, becau&s;e I &s;aw the &s;ame Appear|ances,
whether I looked with my Right, or my Left Eye, and changed the Po|&s;ture
of my Head when I looked; &s;ometimes &s;eeing them with my Head upright,
&s;ometimes with my Head inclined horizontal on one &s;ide, and then on the other;
and &s;o in all variety of Po&s;tures, in which I $till &s;aw them. Nor were they
cau&s;ed by my Gla&s;s, for I &s;aw them with the &s;ame Gla&s;s changed with &s;everal
Apertures, and turned every way round, &s;o as &s;ometimes one Side of the Tube
was upwards, &s;ometimes another; yet the Appearances were the &s;ame, as they
were al&s;o through 4 or 5 other Gla&s;&s;es, through which I &s;aw them in the &s;ame
manner. Nor were they cau&s;ed by the Air, for the Fixed Stars near the Head
of the Comet had no &s;uch Alterations. Again, if it had been the Alterations of
the Air, the Fla&s;hings would have been &s;een to de&s;cend &s;ometimes, and &s;ome|times
to cro&s;s the Blaze; but the&s;e always i&s;&s;ued from the Head, and &s;hot up|ward
into the Blaze, and never any other way, that I could ob&s;erve. And I
have hundreds of times ob&s;erved &s;uch Fla&s;hings with my naked Eye, darting
from the Head even to the whole Length of the Blaze, almo&s;t in a moment.
Be&s;ides, when the&s;e Fla&s;hings ceas'd, as they often did, I could &s;ee divers &s;mall
Tele&s;copical Stars in the middle of the Blaze very plai$ly: Whereas when the
Fla&s;hing appeared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tele&s;copical Stars &s;een through the Blaze.</NOTE> they could not be &s;een for the Light, e&s;pecially the &s;maller
of them; and I &s;aw them on the one &s;ide that was without Emanation, clo&s;e
up to the Pith, but on the other &s;ide of the Pith that had the Light Emanation,
I could not perceive them, and &s;o after a little $span$ <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> Sometimes al&s;o
I could &s;ee them on both &s;ides up to the Pith, in the middle of the Blaze, and
&s;ometimes they would be all hid. This Night I exactly ob&s;erved its Progre&s;&s;es
among the &s;mall Tele&s;copical Stars, to &s;ee if I could have found any &s;en&s;ible
Parallax of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Paralax to be ob&s;erved.</NOTE> but I could di&s;cover none.</P>
<P>I took notice of the &s;ame Appearances on the 16th of <HI>January,</HI> and the $word$
and 24th but very little, as al&s;o on the 26th and 27th.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> the 30th at 11 at Night, I ob&s;erved the Po&s;ition of the Comet; and
&s;everal other Particulars. I ob&s;erved this Night al&s;o, as I had done &s;everal
Nights before very often and very plainly, that the Appearanced was perfectly a
Re&s;emblance of Flame, but that exceeding thin and rari$y'd, and of a $aint
Light: That it waved, $ared, or undulated to and $ro: That it &s;ometimes
&s;eemed to burn clearer and &s;tronger, and &s;ometimes $ain$er and $span$
&s;ometimes on one &s;ide, and then on the other, and sometimes in the middle $f
the Blaze al&s;o, or in the Part oppo&s;ite to the Sun: And which I took $word$ no|tice
<PB N="158" REF="196">
of, as more con&s;iderable, it would be &s;ometimes more on the Side next the
Sun, and &s;ometimes le&s;s: Sometimee it appeared with little or no <HI>Halo</HI> about it,
but only the <HI>Nucleus</HI> or white Cloud with a little Stream or Blaze i&s;&s;uing from
it like the 2d Figure. At other times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 2. Fig. 2.</NOTE> for the twinkling of an Eye, or &s;mall
moment, I could &s;ee a very &s;mall bright Point of Light in the middle of it, as
at <HI>c,</HI> which appeared no bigger than a Tele&s;copical Star, which was very near it,
which immediately di&s;appeared, and &s;eemed to be covered with the white clou|dy
<HI>Nucleus.</HI> This cloudy <HI>Nucleus</HI> was al&s;o much bigger and brighter than at
other times, and &s;ometimes &s;eemed to have &s;everal bright Parts in it, as in the
3d Figure at <HI>f.</HI> Every one of the&s;e Remarks I ob&s;erved at lea&s;t half a &s;core &s;e|veral
times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 2. Fig. 3.</NOTE> and the Changes were very quick; &s;o that I was fully &s;atisfied in
my &s;elf, by all the ways of examining I could think of, that the&s;e Mutations
and &s;trange Appearances, po&s;&s;ibly never, heeded by any before (for I never met
with any mention of them in any Author, or from any Per&s;on that had taken
notice of Comets, but only I have been told by &s;ome antient Men that &s;aw that
in 1618, that it did perfectly &s;parkle and &s;hoot forth Fire; but I confe&s;s I did
not then give credit to them, but attributed the Cau&s;e of their having &s;uch an
Idea or Remembrance of it to their having po&s;&s;ibly more dreadfull Apprehen&s;ions
of it in their younger Years, and al&s;o to the great Brightne&s;s of the Tail of that
Comet): I &s;ay, I was fully &s;atisfied that they were real Mutations in the very
<HI>Phaenomenon</HI> it &s;elf. And this I was the more &s;atisfied of, becau&s;e I had, hun|dreds
of times taken notice with my bare Eye, of the Glancings and Dartings
out of the Light of the Head into the Blaze; in which 'tis almo&s;t incredible
with what Swiftne&s;s the Fla&s;h or darting of Light pa&s;&s;es from the Head to the
very Extremity of the Blaze: For I never, ob&s;erved the Dartings of the Light|ning
(which I have often diligently remark'd and computed to move above a
Mile in le&s;s than half a Second of Time) to move more &s;wiftly from Place to
Place, than I did &s;ee through the Tele&s;cope &s;uch kind of Dartings from the
Star to move: I mean the actual Flame of the Lightning, and not the &s;preading
of the Light it &s;elf, which I conceive rather to be in&s;tantaneous; and though
it do &s;eem to be &s;ucce&s;&s;ive, and to &s;pread in a very quick time from the Center
<HI>in Orbem,</HI> and that the more remote Parts are inlightned after the nearer; yet
I take that to proceed partly from the weaker Impre&s;&s;ion made by the remote
parts on the Eye, and partly from the Yieldingne&s;s of &s;ome parts, of the <HI>Medium</HI>
through which it is propagated. Now if this Appearance be really in the Ob|ject,
as I am &s;atisfied it is, and that this Object be at &s;o va&s;t a di&s;tance from us,
as by all the accurate Ob&s;ervations that have been hitherto made for this pur|po&s;e,
'tis certainly prov'd to be; we &s;hall find by comparing the di&s;tance of the
Lightning, with the di&s;tance of the Comet, how incredibly much &s;wifter the&s;e
Dartings of Light in the Comet will be than the Dartings of the Flame of
Lightning it &s;elf: And yet after all, how incredible &s;oever it &s;eem, I am &s;ati&s;|fied
by my often repeated Ob&s;ervations, that the Matter is really &s;o. It &s;eem'd
to me upon my viewing them often, that 'twas not improbable but that the&s;e
Fla&s;hes or Sparklings were cau&s;ed much after the &s;ame manner as the &s;udden
Kindlings of Steams or Smoke in a Fire, beginning at the Head, and kindling
like a Train into the Tail, which may po&s;&s;ibly be made up of &s;uch a Stream of
combu&s;tible rarify'd Parts, and that the whole Light of the Head and the Blaze
was from the actual &s;hining of the &s;tead and the Parts of the Blaze, but of this
more hereafter. However, this I think is very plain, that the whole Blaze pro|ceeded
and i&s;&s;ued from the Head in material Steams,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$.</NOTE> and that it is not at all
produced by any manner of Refraction of the Rays of the Sun pa&s;ting through
I ob&s;erved all the &s;ame Appearances again the 3d of <HI>February,</HI> and continued to
&s;ee them till $word$ of the Clock at night; &s;o that I was &s;ufficiently confirmed in
the reality of the Appearance, and that it was not a <HI>$word$ Vi&s;us.</HI> I ob&s;erv'd
it again $span$ the 7th and 9th and diligently &s;et its Place among the
Fixed Stars that $word$ near it in its way.</P>
<P>The $word$ time I &s;aw it was on the 10th of <HI>February</HI> at Night, when I fixed its
Place among the Tele&s;copical Stars, with the Direction of its Blaze, which to
the la&s;t all among ob&s;erved very con&s;picuous, $word$ this Night al&s;o through my
14 Foot Tele&s;cope, di&s;cover'd all the before recited <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> as before t$'
<PB N="159" REF="197">
they were very much fainter and paler, and every thing dimini&s;hed as to its Vi|vidne&s;s;
&s;o that I did not expect that it would la&s;t much longer. However, I
believe I might have followed it for a Fortnight or Three Weeks longer, had
not partly other Occa&s;ions, and partly the Cloudine&s;s and Thickne&s;s of the Air,
prevented me from &s;eeing it for 7 or 8 days after, till which time I continued
&s;o often as I had Opportunity, to look for it. Mon&s;. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> it &s;eems, follow'd
it &s;ome days longer, till it arrived at the Foot of <HI>Per&s;eus,</HI> where he al&s;o lo&s;t
fight of it. I do not yet hear that any one has certainly &s;een it beyond that
time, and Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> &s;eems not to be very &s;ure of &s;ome of his la&s;t Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Thus I have given you in &s;hort the Sum of what Phy&s;ical Ob&s;ervations I have
made concerning the&s;e Comets, which as they are new, &s;o they may po&s;&s;ibly
&s;eem the more &s;trange, for that no other that has writ concerning them, has
mention'd any &s;uch Appearances, and for that &s;everal Appearances mention'd by
&s;ome very famous Writers, &s;eem very differing, if not contradictory to the&s;e.
However, what I did ob&s;erve I have &s;et down, that &s;uch as cannot find cau&s;e to
believe them from what I have here &s;et down, may by their future Opportuni|ties
and Ob&s;ervations better inform them&s;elves, and more critically &s;earch and
find out the true Appearances, and at lea&s;t the probable, if not the true Rea|&s;ons
thereof. For I am per&s;waded, that there was &s;carce any Appearance in this
Comet, but may in &s;ome degree, more or le&s;s, be found in every one that &s;hall
appear for the future; for that I look upon them to be all of the &s;ame nature,
and to have all the &s;ame Proprieties in &s;ome mea&s;ure; and I &s;hall be content
not to be believed, if making the Ob&s;ervations in my way, and with as good
In&s;truments, they do not find the like Appearances.</P>
<P>The&s;e Ob&s;ervations had &s;till Iain by me neglected, had not the Appearance of
this la&s;t Comet in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> made me find them out; which put me in mind again
of repeating my former Care and Scrutiny after, the true Appearances, thereof.
I did therefore, &s;o &s;oon as ever I had di&s;cover'd it, put my Gla&s;&s;es in order,
(which had lain by neglected &s;ince that time) and re&s;olved in this wholly to
mind tho&s;e kind of Ob&s;ervations, for that I hoped I &s;hould from other hands receive &s;ufficiently exact A&s;tronomical Ob&s;ervations thereof, of which I &s;hall
afterwards have more occa&s;ion to make u&s;e, when I come to enquire concerning
the Di&s;tance, Cour&s;e, Velocity, Magnitude and Original of them. And tho'
the Determination and Demon&s;tration of all the&s;e do require a great Stock of
accurate Ob&s;ervations purpo&s;ely and pertinently made, which is hardly to be
obtained from all that have hitherto writ concerning them; yet from &s;uch as
they are, I &s;hall &s;hew &s;ome Conjectures, which to me &s;eem to have &s;omewhat
of probability in them, which may &s;erve at lea&s;t as Hints to &s;uch as have Op|portunity
to ob&s;erve them, and are furni&s;hed with better Abilities and better
In&s;truments than I have hitherto been furni&s;hed with.</P>
<Q><HI>NB.</HI> The&s;e A&s;tronomical Ob&s;ervations, and our Author's Remarks upon them,
I have not met with among&s;t his Papers; &s;o that I verily believe he never
procured them, or at lea&s;t never made any Animadver&s;ions, as is be$$ men|tioned.

<P>But to proceed to the Ob&s;ervations I made of this la&s;t Comet, which appear'd
<HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 16th 1682. The Forepart of the Night being exceeding clear over|head,
looking upon the Heavens, I di&s;cover'd a Comet in the North a little
above the Horizon, glancing its Blaze toward the South-Ea&s;t between &s;ome thin
Clouds that were near the Horizon, and pre&s;ently fetching a &s;ix foot Tele&s;cope,
and viewing the &s;tead of it, I remarked its Po&s;ition to &s;ome Tele&s;copical Stars
that were near in, and with my naked Eye found the $span$ the
Stars about them; the mo&s;t con&s;picuous of which were two little Stars of
the 3d Magnitude, in the Fore Foot of the Great Bear marked by <HI>Bayer</HI> with
<HI>s</HI> and <HI>x,</HI> and 'twas near in a Line with <HI>s</HI> and <HI>T;</HI> 'twas pretty vivid, and through
the Tele&s;cope &s;eemed to have a bright and &s;trong <HI>Nucleus,</HI> though &s;mall, not
very defined, and the Light or Halo about the Head was much of the Form of
all the other I had &s;een, when very con&s;picuous. The Side next the Sun was
pretty round and at a good di&s;tance from the <HI>Nucleus,</HI> and the Blaze &s;truck
from it in a Parabolick Figure.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="198">
I had not the Opportunity of ob&s;erving it again till <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 20th at 9 at
Night, at which time I took its place.</P>
<P>Through the Tele&s;cope it appeared of a shape which is &s;hewn in the Draught
or Picture.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 2. Fig. 4.</NOTE> See Fig. 4.</P>
<P>The <HI>Nucleus</HI> was the &s;malle&s;t, but the brighte&s;t I have &s;een; the hazy Light
about it was &s;o much the brighter, the nearer it was po&s;ited to the <HI>Nucleus.</HI>
The brighte&s;t part of the Head dimini&s;h'd to about 5 or 6 Diameters of the bright
Star, as I may call it, in the middle, without which was a thinner <HI>Halo,</HI> which
was about twice as broad without it, which was of a pretty equal Light; and this
towards the Sun was terminated in a rounding Figure, not very defined, yet &s;o
much, that immediately beyond the Sky look'd black, and was clear of it. The
brighter part about the Star or <HI>Nucleus</HI> &s;eemed to &s;pread more or brighter to|wards
the Blaze than any other way, a little tapering; but the thinner part was
much more &s;pread that way, aud extended about eight or ten Degrees, which
made up the Blaze. This &s;eem'd to be a kind of Smoke or Steam, which ta|per'd
towards that length from the Sun; &s;o that the brighter part &s;eem'd &s;ome|what
like a thin Flame, and tapering a little into the Blaze, but was &s;oon &s;pent,
and the other thinner part, or Flame, made up all the re&s;t to he Blaze.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 21. I &s;aw it again, and noted its Place, but was diverted by accident
from making Tele&s;copical Ob&s;ervations, and &s;etting them down.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 22. I noted the Po&s;ition, Shape and Length of its Blaze, but nothing
el&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 26. At 7 in the Evening,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate, 2. Fig. 5.</NOTE> I delineated the Figure and Shape of the Co|met
exactly like that I &s;aw through my 14 Foot Tele&s;cope, which will appear
more plain by the 5th Figure than I can otherwi&s;e well expre&s;s it. It had a
pretty bright round <HI>Nucleus,</HI> and about that was an Atmo&s;phere of thinner
Light; which was terminated towards the Sun with a round Figure. That part
of this <HI>Halo</HI> or lighter Atmo&s;phere towards the Sun was nor &s;o bright and ra|diant
as another kind of Light, which &s;eemed to i&s;&s;ue from the <HI>Nucleus</HI> or
Star both ways at Right Angles, with the Axis through the Sun; which lighter
I&s;&s;uings bent into a kind of Parabolical Figure within the former <HI>Halo</HI> or At|mo&s;phere;
and was terminated within it, and &s;eem'd to form as it were a 2d
Parabolical Termination towards the Sun, in the <HI>Apex</HI> of which <HI>Parabola</HI> was
the bright <HI>Nucleus,</HI> and this brighter Parabolical Line of Light &s;eemed as gro&s;s
or thick as the <HI>Nucleus</HI> it &s;elf. This i&s;&s;ued on both &s;ides, but that on the Right
Hand, or the Northermo&s;t, was much more con&s;picuous; in&s;omuch, that that
on the Left Hand, or towards the South, was to be &s;een but &s;ometimes, but that
of the other &s;ide was very plain and con&s;picuous, and &s;eem'd like a Stream of
Flame blown out of a Candle by Blowpipe a&s;cending or bending upwards ju&s;t
as &s;uch a blown Flame of a Candle will do, if it be made by a gentle Bla&s;t.
This I remark'd very carefully, to &s;ee whether I could find by any &s;ucceeding
Ob&s;ervations, any Al$eration of the Magnitude, Figure, Brightne&s;s or Po&s;ition
in re&s;pect of the Comets <HI>Axis.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e two brighter Spoutings of Flame or Light turned or bent upwards
from the Sun, and after a &s;hort &s;pace &s;eemed to unite into the <HI>Axis</HI> or Middle
of the Blaze, and $word$ the Shape of the out&s;ide of the Flame of Candle ta|pering
to a point; the fainter part al&s;o without a &s;eemed to taper much in the
&s;ame manner. I &s;aw al&s;o &s;everal $word$ or Fla&s;hings of the
Flame &s;houting out to a great di&s;tance into the Blaze.</P>
<P>$span$
<PB N="161" REF="199">
it made a kind of tapering Light; but the oppo&s;ite Side was not near &s;o plain
or ea&s;y to be &s;een.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 30. I viewed it again with my 14 Foot Tube, and found its Figure &s;uch
as I have de&s;cribed in the Draught. The <HI>Halo</HI> or Atmo&s;phere about the Head,
on that &s;ide which was next the Sun, was thinner than the la&s;t time I &s;aw it,
not &s;preading &s;o far that way as then. The Fu&s;e or Stream on the North &s;ide
of it was very plain and bright, but &s;eemed not to i&s;&s;ue now at Right Angles
with the Axis of the Blaze, but, as it were, at 45 degrees with it, and then bent
into the Blaze with a kind of Parabolick Figure, and &s;o ran Parallel with the
Axis to a great length, and did not taper in towards it, as on the 29th. The
i&s;&s;uing on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide was hardly at all vi&s;ible, only it &s;eemed a little bright|er
in that part, than in the middle part of the Blaze near the Head.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 31. I took its Place and the Direction of its Blaze by the 14 Foot Tele|&s;cope.
The bright <HI>Nucleus</HI> appeared much as it had done the preceding Nights,
and the Fu&s;e Stream of Light had much the &s;ame Inclination to the <HI>Axis</HI> as
la&s;t Night, only it &s;eemed now to run farther parallel to the <HI>Axis</HI> into the Blaze.
The Hazine&s;s of the Head about the <HI>Nucleus,</HI> on that &s;ide which was next the
Sun, was now much thinner and nearer to the <HI>Nucleus,</HI> and pretty well defined.</P>
<P>There was a little Emanation an&s;wering to it on the Left Hand, but that was
exceeding faint; yet the Sides were brighter than the middle part near the <HI>Axis.</HI>
I &s;aw the flaring of the Light, and the Corru&s;cation, as I had done almo&s;t every
time I &s;aw it. The <HI>Nucleus</HI> was not a tenth part of the bigne&s;s of the <HI>Halo</HI> or <HI>Haze</HI> about it.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> the 1&s;t, I viewed it again with my 14 Foot Tele&s;cope. I could &s;ee
no &s;mall Stars near it; the Fu&s;ee or Stream of Light appeared much as it had
done the two preceding Nights. I &s;till plainly &s;aw the Flaring or Fla&s;hing of
the Light, and &s;ometimes al&s;o &s;aw a Shooting or Spouting as it were of Light
from the <HI>Nucleus</HI> directly into the Blaze, which as quickly di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>I began to &s;ee it <HI>September</HI> the 4 at 7&frac12;, the <HI>Crepu&s;culum</HI> being yet very bright.
The <HI>Nucleus</HI> was pretty clear and round, but the Blaze from it was only two
Emanations of a kind of Parabolick Figure on each &s;ide, as in the Figure; but
the Northern Side was brighter than the Southern &s;till, and they &s;eemed to
&s;pread one from another with an Angle of about 60 Degrees, &s;o far as I could
&s;ee them then: for they extended but a little way from the <HI>Nucleus.</HI> The
middle part of the Blaze between them was hardly vi&s;ible. But as the <HI>Crepu&s;|culum</HI>
dimini&s;hed, it appeared much brighter and fuller, and then I could &s;ee
its Light al&s;o in the middle part of the Blaze. Scarce any <HI>Halo</HI> between the
<HI>Nucleus</HI> and Sun appear'd, at fir&s;t, and but little more when it appear'd brighte&s;t.
I ob&s;erved al&s;o the flaring or fla&s;hing of the Light, and a kind of moving of the
Fu&s;ee on the North &s;ide. It was at its brighte&s;t about 8, when I ob&s;erved al&s;o its
Po&s;itions. I followed it with my Tele&s;cope downwards towards the Horizon near
half an hour after it di&s;appeared to my Sight; and I was able to &s;ee it almo&s;t
to the very Horizon, even till it went behind a Steeple a little above the tops of
the Hou&s;es, though the Smoke much thickened the Air. As it grew lower and
lower, the Blaze di&s;appeared by degrees, and at length al&s;o the Hazine&s;s about
the Head; &s;o that I could not &s;ee the two Streams, but only now and then by
glances; but the <HI>Nucleus</HI> it &s;elf I &s;aw very plain, but very much &s;maller than
before, and &s;eemed about the bigne&s;s of <HI>Oculus Tauri,</HI> but very dull and faint,
in compari&s;on even of the &s;mall Fixed Stars which were not far from it.</P>
<P>The Figure of it when brighte&s;t this Night, was much of the &s;hape of the
Flame of a Candle clo&s;e &s;nuffed, the <HI>Nucleus</HI> repre&s;enting the End of the Snuff;
tho' that in a Candle &s;o order'd looks perfectly black, but the <HI>Nucleus</HI> was very
light.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 8. I &s;aw it from 7 1/2 till almo&s;t 8; I took notice of its <HI>Nucleus,</HI> and of
the Emanations on each &s;ide, as al&s;o of the fla&s;hing and flaring of the Light.
The Beams were darted on each &s;ide parabolically, and &s;eemed at fir&s;t almo&s;t
like two Sides of an equilateral Triangle, but when it was cleare&s;t they were
much longer. The Clouds near the Horizon hinder'd me, that I could not &s;ee
it till 8.</P>
<P><HI>Sept</HI> 9. at 7 h. 28 m. I &s;aw it perpendicularly over the top of <HI>Bow</HI>-Steeple;
it was 3 $imes the length of the Dragon above the top of it. The Fu&s;ee of Stream
<PB N="162" REF="200">
&s;eemed ju&s;t above it in that po&s;ture, as if it had been the Blaze it &s;elf bended,
the oppo&s;ite &s;ide being &s;o faint, that I could only now and then perceive it. The
Blaze was at Right Angles with a Line from <HI>Arcturus</HI> through the Head. I
&s;aw very plainly now al&s;o the flaring, fla&s;hing and wavering of the Light. I
continued to ob&s;erve it and make my Remarks till it almo&s;t toucht the Horizon,
though the Air was very &s;moaky near the tops of the Hou&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 10. I fir&s;t discovered it with a 4 Foot Tele&s;cope, at 7 1/4. It appeared
very faint: There was nothing be&s;ides the <HI>Nucleus</HI> and the Parabolical Edges
of the Blaze, or the two Emanations from the <HI>Nucleus;</HI> the Northern &s;ide was
&s;till the brighter and longer. It was very much &s;maller and fainter this Night
than Ye&s;ter-night and yet the Sky clearer and darker. I could not find any
Fixed Stars near it through the Tele&s;cope, nor could I &s;ee any Stars with my
Eyes, the Sky being very cloudy all above it, it ju&s;t appearing under and be|tween
&s;everal Clouds: Nor could I, nor I believe any body el&s;e, &s;ee it now with
his naked Eye; and yet through my 14 Foot Tele&s;cope I perceived very plainly
the Streams, with the Flaring, Fla&s;hing, and &s;ometimes a perfect Lightning,
as it were, in the parts of the Blaze pretty far di&s;tant from the Head; which I
6 or 8 times took notice of to be almo&s;t in the very <HI>Axis</HI> or middle of the Blaze.
I by many trials this Night al&s;o &s;atisfied my &s;elf that the&s;e Appearances were
no Delu&s;ions of the Sight, but proceeded from real Mutations in the Body
it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Since which time I have never been able to make any farther Ob&s;ervations of
it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Explication of the Appear|ances.</NOTE> by rea&s;on of the cloudy thick Air.</P>
<P>Now by all the&s;e Ob&s;ervations it appears very evident to me, that a Comet is
a Body mo&s;t probably round, &s;ituate in the middle of that part we call the <HI>Nu|cleus,</HI>
or the brighter part in the middle of the Head, which is inveloped by a
kind of Atmo&s;phere of thick Clouds or Smoak: That a lighter or thinner kind
of parts, like Vapours, &s;pread from it to a much greater di&s;tance, po&s;&s;ibly
8 or 10 times as far towards the Sun, which by their Limitation in respect of
the Sun, are driven back again, and return upwards, and oppo&s;ite to the Sun.
Of the&s;e kind of Emanations there &s;eem two &s;orts: One that goes to a greater
di&s;tance, and is but very fine and thin, which makes the outmo&s;t Edge of the
<HI>Halo</HI> about the Head, when the Comet appears bigge&s;t and brighte&s;t, and is in
its neare&s;t Approach to the Earth. The other, which is a thicker and gro&s;&s;er,
which de&s;cends not &s;o far towards the Sun, but is po&s;&s;ibly more firey, and &s;o
recoiles upwards &s;ooner, and makes the Parabolical Emanations that appeared
on both &s;ides of it. The bigge&s;t and brighte&s;t of which was that towards the
North, or that part, which was the hindermo&s;t in its way of Motion, the Fore|&s;ide
thereof being very thin, and but at &s;ome times vi&s;ible; whereas the other
was always very con&s;picuous. As it went farther and farther off from the Earth,
&s;o the thinner part more and more di&s;appeared (which was very vi&s;ible when it
it was in its neare&s;t Approach): So that all the time I &s;aw it in <HI>September,</HI> the
&s;econd or thinner <HI>Halo</HI> di&s;appeared;, which I &s;uppo&s;e was cau&s;ed, fir&s;t by the
greater di&s;tance of it from the Earth, and &s;econdly the Light of the <HI>Crepu&s;cu|lum,</HI>
in which it was always placed. And this I judge, becau&s;e even when it
was much more vi&s;ible, if I viewed it pretty early before the Day-light was
much &s;pent, I could only &s;ee tho&s;e two Radiations from the <HI>Nucleus,</HI> without
&s;eeing the thinner <HI>Halo</HI> about the Head; which yet I &s;aw afterwards when the
Evening was darker, which I &s;everal times took notice of, and which did recon|cile
what I had obe&s;erved concerning the differing Appearance of other Comets
towards the latter end of their Appearance.</P>
<P>The white Cloud about the Body, which I call the <HI>Nucleus,</HI> I take to be
&s;omewhat analogous to a thick Smoak or Steam, before it was fired, which only
inveloped the firey Body in the mid&s;t of it, which I take to be the Solid, through
which I very often perceived a &s;udden &s;mall bright momentary Glance of Light,
which I conceive was either the bright Body in the middle, or el&s;e &s;ome kind|ling
of the Smoak or luculent Flame about it; but I rather took it to be the for|mer.
The two Emanations I take to be the under Edge of the actual, though
thin Flame, which, as I have noted, did perfectly re&s;emble the Shape of the
Flame of a Candle tapering above the Comet towards the <HI>Axis,</HI> and &s;ometimes
meeting in it pretty near the Head, though at other times it were prolonged to
<PB N="163" REF="201">
a much greater di&s;tance, and &s;eemed to a&s;cend almo&s;t parallel. The thinner
hazy part without this, which made up the Head, and a great part of the Blaze
or Tail, I take to be a kind of Halituous Sub&s;tance, that did not actually kindle
into Flame, but appeared by the Light of the Sun, and in part al&s;o by the
Light of the Comet it &s;elf, that is, of the &s;hining Cloud or luculent Flame.
The &s;udden Fla&s;hings I &s;o very frequently &s;aw, I think are evidently a certain
kindling of &s;ome parts within the compa&s;s of the Flame, which like Lightning,
the one End of them near the Comet taking fire, a whole Train of them fol|low,
as one may al&s;o commonly &s;ee in the Flame of a Fire. The flaring of the
Light, now on one &s;ide, and then on another, I take to proceed only from the
nature of the Emanations, which &s;ometimes proceed on one &s;ide, and &s;ometimes
on the other, which are more apt to take fire and turn into Flame. The &s;udden
Dartings out of Light, which &s;eemed to extend, to the naked Eye, even to the
whole Length of the Blaze, I take to proceed partly from &s;uch a kind of kind|ling
as I ju&s;t now mentioned, and partly al&s;o po&s;&s;ibly from a temporaneous Pro|pagation
of Light, which, as I &s;hall afterwards &s;hew, in a yielding or &s;pringy
Body, is temporaneous, and not in&s;tantaneous. So that po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome &s;uch &s;ud|den
Glance of bright Light, which I often &s;aw break through the middle of the
<HI>Nucleus,</HI> might be propagated to the reflective parts of the whole length of the
Blaze, and &s;o be reflected &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; which is otherwi&s;e &s;o exceeding rapid
and quick, that con&s;idering the va&s;t length of the Blaze, it &s;eems unconceivable
how it &s;hould be moved: For the quickne&s;s of Lightning is nothing to be
compared to it, though by many Ob&s;ervations I have &s;een it move near a Mile
in a quarter of a Second Minute of Time, but this mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily move many
thou&s;ands of Miles in a &s;horter time.</P>
<P>To conclude, all the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> did &s;o perfectly re&s;emble the Appearances of
a burning, flaming and &s;teaming Body here in the Air near the Earth, that &s;o
far as I can yet inform my &s;elf, I &s;ee no rea&s;on to doubt, that it is a Body qua|lified
much in the &s;ame manner as a Body on fire, or burning in the open Air
with us. Though if Fire be only a Di&s;&s;olution of a Body by the nitrous part
of the Air, it may &s;eem pretty difficult to explain how there &s;hould be any Fire
in tho&s;e Places through which Comets have been ob&s;erved to move. Next,
though the Exi&s;tence of &s;omewhat analogous to Fire and Flame, &s;hould be
&s;hewn probable in Comets, and in the Places through which they pa&s;s, yet it
may &s;eem difficult to conceive how the Flame and Steams thereof &s;hould chiefly
i&s;&s;ue and move towards tho&s;e parts of the Space that are farthe&s;t off from the
Body of the Sun; for &s;o it has been ob&s;erved to do by all the late&s;t and be&s;t Ob|&s;ervations:
And thence it has happen'd, that almo&s;t all that have written more
particularly concerning them, have explain'd the Appearance of the Blaze,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That Reflection and Refraction of the Sun|beams are in|&s;ufficient to ex|plain the Ap|pearances.</NOTE> not
by a Matter i&s;&s;uing from the Head of the Comet, but by a certain Collection of
the Sun Beams made by a Refraction of them in the Head of the Comet; &s;ome
without any con&s;ideration of a den&s;er Matter fit to reflect tho&s;e Rays &s;o col|lected
back to our view; though there be &s;ome others, among which is Mon&s;.
<HI>Hevelius,</HI> that have &s;een the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a reflecting Matter, be&s;ides the
meer Refraction of them in the Head. But in &s;hort, I have not yet met with any Hypothe&s;is of that kind that has given &s;uch an Explication of the manner
of tho&s;e Reflections and Refractions, as will accord with the vi&s;ible Appear|ances
that any one that will be diligent and circum&s;pect may ea&s;ily ob&s;erve. For
taking Refractions and Reflections to be made as they &s;uppo&s;e them, and con|&s;idering
what the Figures of the Appearances mu&s;t then of con&s;equence be, they
will be found exceeding different from what they really are, and will give no
&s;atisfactory Explanation to a &s;trict Enquirer. Leaving therefore the further Exa|mination
of the&s;e Hypothe&s;es to their A&s;&s;ertors, or to &s;uch as may think them
to contain &s;omewhat more of probability than what I am here willing to allow
them; I &s;hall rather proceed to the con&s;ideration of that Hypothe&s;is
which the Ob&s;ervations I have made do more incline me to embrace. Now though I con|&s;e&s;s
there may at fir&s;t con&s;idering of it appear &s;everal, and tho&s;e no ordinary Dif|ficulties
in this my Suppo&s;ition, yet when I have a little further explained the
Rea&s;ons and Cau&s;es, which I conceive of the Cele&s;tial. Appearances, they may
appear to have &s;omewhat more of probability than po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome may imagine.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="202">
The greate&s;t Difficulties that I conceive in this Hypothe&s;is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Five Difficul|ties in this Hy|pothe&s;is.</NOTE> are Five, namely,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> If the Comet be a burning Body, or a Body in di&s;&s;olution, how comes
it, that it can &s;upply &s;o va&s;t a quantity of Flame of &s;teaming Emanations, as to
form an Appearance of &s;o prodigious a bigne&s;s and length, as tho&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity
mu&s;t be which have been &s;o often and &s;o exactly ob&s;erved; as in tho&s;e, to in&s;tance
in no more, which were ob&s;erved by all the Northern World in 1618, and late|ly
in 1680, and yet notwith&s;tanding, la&s;t, without a &s;udden and total Di&s;per|&s;ion
or Con&s;umption of that exceeding &s;mall Body in the Head, from whence
they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be all &s;upply'd.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Next if the Blaze of Comets be from the Head, and that the Comets
are Bodies which are moved with a pretty &s;wift Motion through the Spaces
of the <HI>Aether,</HI> how comes it to pa&s;s that this Flame or Steam does not follow after
or point directly to the way through which the Head or Body it &s;elf has pa&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> If the Blaze be in part an actual Flame, and the Head be a Body
actually on fire, or in a State of Di&s;&s;olution, and that all the Fires and Flames
we know have need either of actual Nitre, or of a Nitrous Air to make them,
which being &s;atiated, the Fire or Flame will no longer continue; without a far|ther
Supply either of actual Nitre or Nitrous Air; how comes there to be either
&s;uch a quantity of actual Nitre in the Body of the Comet, or of Nitrous Air
in the <HI>Expan&s;um</HI> in which the Blaze is ob&s;erved to extend, and yet neither the
Head of the Comet be &s;uppo&s;ed a terre&s;trial Body, nor the Nitrous Air be &s;up|po&s;ed
to extend beyond the Limits of the Atmo&s;phere about the Earth, which
tho&s;e that have given it the greate&s;t Exten&s;ion, do a&s;&s;ign to be not above 50
Miles above the Surface of the Earth and Sea, and tho&s;e others that think this
too great, will not allow it to be a 5th part of that height?</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Suppo&s;ing there could be found a Rea&s;on or Cau&s;e, why the Body
of the Comet &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to contain &s;ome &s;uch Sub&s;tance as Nitre, and
that there might al&s;o as probably be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;uch a Sub&s;tance di&s;per&s;ed through
the <HI>Aether,</HI> as would produce a Flame like that of a Candle, or other flaming
Body here in the Air; yet what Cau&s;e can be a&s;&s;igned why it &s;hould not equally
di&s;per&s;e it &s;elf every way from the burning Body, as we find Flame here with
us to do every way from the Center of the Earth? And why does it always
extend it &s;elf towards that part of the <HI>Aether</HI> only that is farthe&s;t off from the
Sun in re&s;pect of the Head of the Comet?</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> If this Appearance of the Blaze were an actual Flame, yet how &s;hould
it be po&s;&s;ible, that it &s;hould continue a Flame &s;o long, as to extend to &s;o va&s;t a
length, as po&s;&s;ibly of &s;ome hundred thou&s;and, nay of &s;ome Millions of Miles,
and not be extinct in &s;ome very &s;hort Space, as the flaming Parts of Bodies here
with us are ob&s;erved to be, which are &s;uddenly kindled and converted into Flame,
and that Flame as &s;uddenly wa&s;ted and di&s;per&s;ed, as indeed every part of the
Flame we &s;ee of a Fire or Candle is? For though the Flame of a Candle
&s;eems to la&s;t till the whole Candle be burnt out, yet 'tis not really two moments
the &s;ame Flame, but the parts of the Flame are every moment annihilated, and
others in the &s;ame place every moment afre&s;h &s;upplied from the Steams that are
continually i&s;&s;uing out of the Wieke. Now it &s;eems inconceivable how it &s;hould
be po&s;&s;ible, either that Steams &s;hould be carried to &s;o great a di&s;tance, or that
Flame &s;hould la&s;t &s;o long a Journey, as from the Head to the utmo&s;t Extent of
the Blaze.</P>
<P>The&s;e and &s;ome other Difficulties there are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Explication continued, to prove the Au|thor's Hypo|the&s;is.</NOTE> which when one has well con|&s;idered,
of the va&s;t Di&s;tance of them, even when neare&s;t to us, which all the
accurate&s;t Ob&s;ervations do mo&s;t manife&s;tly evince, and con&s;equently the exceed|ing
Magnitude of their Body, and prodigious Extent of their Blaze, and as a
con&s;equence of the&s;e, the great Swiftne&s;s of their Motions, 'twill be enough
to &s;tartle one, and make one de&s;pair of ever being able to render a true Expli|cation
<PB N="165" REF="203">
of the Cau&s;es of the&s;e Effects. And 'tis very apt to make &s;everal Per|&s;ons
to have recour&s;e to an immediate, extraordinary and divine Power acting,
not according to the general Laws and Methods of the re&s;t of Nature, but ac|cording
to a &s;ingular and particular Determination of that Power for the exhi|biting
tho&s;e Appearances extraordinarily to Mankind: Whence &s;ome a&s;cribe them
to the miraculous Power of good Angels immediately directed by the Will of
the omnipotent Creator: Others (of which we have lately a Treati&s;e on pur|po&s;e,
upon the acc&s;ion of the great Comet in 1680.) to a&s;&s;ert them to be pro|duced
and moved by the Power of Evil Spirits of Devils. But the&s;e, as the
Subterfuges of Ignorance, and the want of Indu&s;try, we leave to their A&s;&s;er|tors.
And though I mu&s;t confe&s;s it to be a very difficult Attempt to manife&s;t
and demon&s;trate the true Theory of them, yet I &s;hall endeavour from that &s;mall
Stock of Ob&s;ervations I have hitherto met with, and tho&s;e Imperfect and mean
Helps I have hitherto had, to &s;hew at lea&s;t a probability, what they are, and
how moved, and that they may be &s;ame &s;uch kind of Bodies as I conjecture
them to be; and that in many Proprieties they may be con&s;onant and agreeable
to the other Cele&s;tial Bodies. Now to do this as it ought, one &s;hould be ac|quainted
with what tho&s;e Proprieties are, which may be known of any other
Cele&s;tial Bodies: For if they be found agreeable in tho&s;e, we may more ratio|nally
&s;uppo&s;e a further Agreement in other unknown Properties.</P>
<P>Now there &s;eem to be but two &s;orts in general of Cele&s;tial Bodies, and tho&s;e
are either fluid or &s;olid. By &s;olid I under&s;tand all tho&s;e Bodies that appear, and
are made &s;en&s;ible to us, either by their own Light, or by the Light of another
Body reflected from them. So that the&s;e Solids do &s;eem of two kinds, that is,
either Bodies appearing by their own Light, or Bodies appearing by the help of
&s;ome other Light. And po&s;&s;ibly the Comets may be a third &s;ort, that is, &s;uch
as appear partly by the help of their own Light, and partly by the help of
other Light reflected from them.</P>
<P>The fluid parts of the World I here &s;uppo&s;e of two kinds, that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Fluids of two kinds.</NOTE> one who&s;e
Parts are &s;ome &s;ort &s;olid, and may have determinate Figures, Magnitudes and
Motions; and the other, which hath no one Part that may be called a Solid,
but its Parts are infinitely or indefinitely fluid.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t I call the Een-fluid, or almo&s;t-fluid <HI>Aether;</HI> the &s;econd, the quite
fluid <HI>Aether.</HI></P>
<P>The former part of this Divi&s;ion of Mundane or Aethereal Bodies, I &s;uppo&s;e
is ea&s;y enough to be under&s;tood and granted: And the &s;econd, though it &s;eems
a meer Chimera, and without real ground in Nature, yet by tho&s;e Ob&s;ervations
and Experiments I &s;hall afterwards produce, I hope it may appear, at lea&s;t to
be po&s;&s;ible, though there may be no one found than can po&s;itively demon&s;trate
it to be &s;o, and not otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>And this po&s;&s;ibly may be the utmo&s;t that Man's Sen&s;es and Rea&s;on will ever
inable him to perform,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mo&s;t that Man's Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on will enable him to perform.</NOTE> in the acquiring of the Knowledge of &s;uch Cau&s;es,
Principles and Operations; the Method and In&s;truments wherewith they work
being far removed beyond the reach of our Sen&s;es: And therefore the be&s;t and
utmo&s;t we can do towards the di&s;covery of them, is only accurately to ob&s;erve
and examine all tho&s;e Effects produced by them, which fall within the Power
of our Sen&s;es, and comparing them with like Effects, produced by Cau&s;es that
fall within the reach of our Sen&s;es, to examine, and &s;o from Sen&s;ibles to argue
the Similitude of the nature of Cau&s;es that are wholly in&s;en&s;ible. And this is
the utmo&s;t Bound and Limit of our mo&s;t exalted and regulated Rea&s;oning,
beyond which that Power cannot carry us. We may therefore re&s;t &s;atisfied with
what that will furni&s;h us; and 'twill furni&s;h us with a great deal, and far
more than po&s;&s;ibly any one has thoroughly &s;hewn and demon&s;trated, or perhaps
&s;o much as ever conceived it could, if a right Method be followed in the mak|ing
of Ob&s;ervation pertinent, and of u&s;ing them &s;o as they may exert their
utmo&s;t Power toward producing the Di&s;covery. The Power of Man's Facul|ties
in this kind, has not, I fear, been &s;ufficiently thought upon, much le&s;s di&s;|covered,
and all that has been hitherto produced &s;eems rather to be &s;ome lucky
hits of chance, then the nece&s;&s;ary Products of a regular Art grounded upon the
une$ing Indications and Dictates of Nature. But this only by the by. I
return then to the Explication of the Comet, and in order to the removing
<PB N="166" REF="204">
tho&s;e Difficulties that I have named, and &s;ome other, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to
con&s;ider what are the mo&s;t known Proprieties of the &s;olid Cele&s;tial Bodies, to
&s;ee how far this Body, we are con&s;idering,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An&s;wer to the former Difficul|ties.</NOTE> will agree or di&s;agree with them.</P>
<P>All &s;olid Cele&s;tial Bodies then have two Proprieties;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Solid Cele&s;tial Bodies.</NOTE> fir&s;t a Faculty of emit|ting
or reflecting light; &s;econdly an Orbicular Figure.</P>
<P>The Sun and Fixed Stars, by the be&s;t Ob&s;ervations I can yet make,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. They have or reflect Light.</NOTE> &s;eem to
have the Power of emitting Light, the Planets, both primary and &s;econdary,
of reflecting the Light ca&s;t upon them from other Bodies; among which the
Earth may be reckoned for one. This mo&s;t certainly does, as well as the other
Planets, reflect the Light of the Sun; one Evidence of which is the inlightning
of the Moon thereby, when it is near the Conjunctions.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Propriety of their Orbicular or Spherical Form,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. They are Or|bicular, and thence have a Gravitation to them. The&s;e the two chief Principles in Nature.</NOTE> is an Indication
of another active Principle, which I conceive univer&s;al to all &s;olid Bodies in
Nature, and that is, of a Gravitation or Power of attracting &s;imilar &s;olid Bo|dies
towards their Centers. Which two Principles I take to be the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable
and the mo&s;t active in Nature, and tho&s;e from which the mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable
Effects are produced; and when they are under&s;tood and explain'd as they
ought, I que&s;tion not but that they will afford us Solutions and Rea&s;ons for a
1000 <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> the Explication of which do now &s;o much puzzle and per|plex
us.</P>
<P>Concerning the fir&s;t of the&s;e I have already pretty largely di&s;cour&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In his Lectures of Light.</NOTE> and ex|plain'd
thereby the manner of its Production and Propagation, and what Effects
are thereby produced; how it comes to produce Sen&s;ation in the Eye, and how
it cau&s;eth Heat, Rarefaction, Liquefaction, Ignition, and the like; and &s;ome|what
al&s;o I have mentioned concerning the Refraction, Reflections, Inflection,
deadning and quickning of the Radiations thereof; as likewi&s;e of compound|ing,
dividing, and variou&s;ly blending of them in the Production of Colours.
But I &s;hall not now farther enter upon the Explication of them, re&s;erving them
to &s;ome other parts of my Di&s;cour&s;e, which are yet behind, concerning the Na|ture
of Light. That which I have at pre&s;ent to con&s;ider, is rather how Light
comes to be produced in the Head and Blaze of Comets.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e Bodies being &s;o far removed from our reach, and appearing &s;o &s;el|dom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Light is produced in the Head and Blaze of Comets.</NOTE>
and the Helps we have hitherto met with affording us &s;o very little that is
to this purpo&s;e, I hope it will not be expected that I &s;hould be able to bring &s;uch
powerful Arguments as may not be at lea&s;t doubted of, if not po&s;itively contra|dicted.
I confe&s;s my great want of &s;uch; however, I find from tho&s;e few
Ob&s;ervations 1 have made, &s;ome Arguments that do much incline me to think,
that what I have conjectured of them is very con&s;onant to the appearing Effects
of them, though in every Particular it does not &s;o exactly agree.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then for my fir&s;t Suppo&s;ition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;t Suppo&s;ition, that there is a den&s;e bright Body in the <HI>Nucleus.</HI></NOTE> that there is in the middle of that white
cloudy part near the middle of the Head, which we call the <HI>Nucleus,</HI> another
more den&s;e and bright &s;hining Body than what is ordinarily taken notice of; I ar|gue
from two Particulars. The fir&s;t is, that I hundreds of times have taken notice
of some &s;hort and momentary Appearings of &s;uch a Star like Spot, as I have
mention'd in my Ob&s;ervations; which is almo&s;t an ocular Demonstration; I &s;ay
almo&s;t, becau&s;e po&s;&s;ibly it may be &s;aid, that tho&s;e were but (like &s;ome of the
re&s;t,) Flashings or Kindlings of &s;ome parts of that Cloud of Smoak. And I
confe&s;s I was often of that opinion my &s;elf, when I compared them with the
other Fla&s;hings and Spoutings of Light I have mention'd: But then when I
con&s;ider'd the &s;econd Argument, that there mu&s;t be &s;omewhere a very &s;olid Bo|dy,
otherwi&s;e it could not be moved with &s;o &s;wift, and &s;o regular and uniform a
Motion, as all Comets that have been accurately ob&s;erved, have been found to
do; I conceived there was more likelihood to conclude, that it might be &s;ome
part of the Star it &s;elf through &s;ome Cha&s;ms in the &s;moaky Atmo&s;phere. For
unless there were &s;ome &s;uch Body, 'tis not to be imagined, that a Cloud, &s;uch
as <HI>Hevelius</HI> has &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;hould be able to be moved &s;o va&s;t a Space &s;o regu|larly,
and with &s;o &s;wift a Motion; nor that it &s;hould be able to afford Matter
enough to make and &s;upply &s;o va&s;tly big and long-extended a Blaze. For there
cannot be allowed to it an <HI>Aether</HI> moving along with it, in which it &s;hould
&s;wim like a Cloud in the Air, or Froth on the Water: For if &s;o, how could
<PB N="167" REF="205">
that in 1664 go Retrograde, and quite contrary to the Motions of the Heavens,
if it pa&s;&s;ed between the Earth and <HI>Mars,</HI> as I have &s;everal Arguments that make
me believe it did? Nay, how could all of them move Retrograde to the Mo|tions
of the Planets, which I hope 1 may &s;hew &s;ome Arguments to prove?
Tho&s;e that hold &s;olid Orbs, will afford it no room, nor tho&s;e that hold <HI>Vortices.</HI>
Tho&s;e indeed that &s;uppo&s;e Demons, may &s;uppo&s;e what they will, but to little
purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Next, unle&s;s there were &s;ome very den&s;e and very violently burning Body
&s;omewhere in the Head, it could not afford &s;o va&s;t a quantity of Steams, Smoak,
Vapours and Flame, as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily go to the making up of &s;o va&s;t a Blaze,
which is not a con&s;tant abiding Body like a Cloud; but, as I manife&s;tly di&s;co|vered,
rather of the Nature of Smoak, Steams, and Flame, from a burning
Body, which are continually in a State of Di&s;&s;olution and Wa&s;ting, and are con|tinually
&s;upply'd by &s;ome Fountain or burning Body in the Head; and this Bo|dy
can be no where placed but within the cloudy <HI>Nucleus.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, if there were not &s;ome &s;uch Body within the cloudy <HI>Nucleus,</HI> the
Roundne&s;s of that &s;ide of the Head, that is next the Sun, could not be, nor the
greater Den&s;ity of the Light about and near it: For we &s;ee that Clouds and
Smoak, and the like unconjoin'd Bodies, have irregular difform Shapes; but the
&s;olid Body in the middle mu&s;t be that which made the uniform Roundne&s;s thereof,
as I &s;hall afterwards more fully prove, when I come to explain the Nature of
that other univer&s;al Principle, Gravity, in the proce&s;s of my en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>But (which &s;eems to make the thing yet more probable than all the other
Arguments) I have made a Ball of combu&s;tible Sub&s;tances mixed together,
which being &s;u&s;pended by a Wire in the open Air, and there kindled, would &s;o
very well repre&s;ent all the Appearances in little to the Sight, that the very Re|&s;emblance
thereof &s;eems to be a very per&s;wa&s;ive Argument, that the Effects and
<HI>Phaenomena</HI> of both were produced from like and homogenous Cau&s;es. And
&s;ince the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Ball are produced by the Fire, and by the Gravita|tion
towards the Center of the Earth of the ambient <HI>Medium</HI> of the Air, it
&s;eems not incongruous to conclude, that the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Comet may be
produced by a &s;olid combu&s;tible Ball actually fired, and by a Gravitation of the
ambient <HI>Aether</HI> towards the Center of the Sun. But I know it may be &s;aid, that
<HI>Omne &s;imile non e&s;t idem:</HI> And I will readily grant, that it is not a po&s;itive Proof,
however 'tis po&s;&s;ibly as po&s;itive as the thing it &s;elf will bear: For in a Subject
where we cannot obtain &s;uch &s;ufficient Proofs as we can de&s;ire, we mu&s;t be con|tented
with what we can obtain. And let me add this Con&s;ideration, that all
the Theorys of the Heavens and of Cele&s;tial Bodies, we have hitherto had,
are &s;ubject to the &s;ame Objections that this is; for which of all the Motions of
the Cele&s;tial Bodies hath not been explicated by various Hypothe&s;es? Some
&s;uppo&s;ing the Annual, others the Diurnal Motion of the Earth nece&s;&s;ary: Others
&s;uppo&s;e neither of them, others only one: Some &s;uppo&s;e both the Earth and
the Sun al&s;o to be moved; others again &s;uppo&s;e neither of them, but that both
the Earth and the Sun may &s;tand &s;till, and only the Heavens of the Fixed Stars
may move round them, as <HI>Cocceus</HI> in his Hypothe&s;is: Others have &s;uppo&s;ed the
Moon to &s;tand &s;till, and all to move about that, as&mdash;: Others have pla|ced
&Saturn;, &Jupit;, &Mars;, &Venus;, and &Merc;, as the Central Body, and &s;olved the Appearances by
&s;uppo&s;ing all the other to move about &s;ome one or other of them: And others,
imaginary Points here or there in the <HI>Aether:</HI> And yet every one of them, grant
them but their Suppo&s;itions, will make a &s;hift to &s;olve the Appearances. But
then there will be found &s;o many Inconcinuities in their Suppo&s;itions, which yet
will be found nece&s;&s;ary to be granted to &s;olve the Appearances, that at fir&s;t hear|ing
we reject them as very improbable, and readily bend to that which avoids
them, and hath all things very con&s;onant and congruous: Which is the reason
why the <HI>Copernican</HI> has obtained with all the modern and be&s;t A&s;tronomers, again&s;t
all the other, as being the mo&s;t &s;imple, and the lea&s;t incumber'd of any; e&s;pecially
as it is improved by the Incomparable <HI>Kepler.</HI> All the Rea&s;on of which is from
this Maxim, that <HI>Natura nihil egit fru&s;tra, &s;ed fru&s;tra fit per plura quod fieri
pote&s;t per pauciora.</HI> The Simplicity therefore of the Hypothe&s;is to be granted,
<PB N="168" REF="206">
and the Concinuity of it with the known Operations of Nature, is as cogent
an Argument as can be urged for any Hypothe&s;is of this nature, and that I hope
I &s;hall be able to manife&s;t in this I have pitched on.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I &s;hall now only hint, that tho&s;e vi&s;ible Appearances of
Comets which I have with much care and circum&s;pection ob&s;erved and exami|ned,
with what &s;trictne&s;s and unprejudicatene&s;s I could, do incline me to de|duce
them from the&s;e following Particulars, which I &s;hall more particularly en|deavour to prove hereafter.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Dedu|ctions from the Ob&s;ervations. 1. The <HI>Medi|um</HI> mu&s;t be ex|ceeding $hin and fluid.</NOTE> That tho&s;e Parts of the Heavens through which Comets do pa&s;s, mu&s;t
be a very thin and rarify'd, and an exceeding fluid Medium; otherwi&s;e &s;o very
thin a Body as the Halituous Steams about the Head, and e&s;pecially the more
thin Halituous Steams which make up the Blaze or Tail, could not be moved
through it with so &s;wift a Motion, and that in all Particulars &s;o regular, with|out
much altering or varying the true Form and Po&s;ition thereof; I&s;ay, without
much altering and varying the true Form thereof, becau&s;e, as I &s;hall afterwards
&s;hew, it does really &s;omewhat alter both the Form and Situation of the Head
and Blaze, which would otherwi&s;e in probability appear of a &s;omewhat diffe|rent
Shape.</P>
<P>What I under&s;tand by rarify'd and conden&s;ed, I &s;hall afterwards manifest,
when I come to the Explication of the Con&s;titution of the <HI>Medium,</HI> that fills the
Spaces between the &s;olid Globular Bodies: For though it freely permits a Body
to be moved through it, it cannot be thence argued, that it contains a le&s;s quan|tity
of Body within the &s;ame Dimen&s;ions, but only that there is a le&s;s quantity
of &s;olid Body, or uniform and united Motion.</P>
<P>Secondly, That there is a Gravitation towards, and a Levitation from the
Body of the Sun: For as I have by many of the Ob&s;ervations &s;hewn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. There is a Gravitation to and Levitation from the Sun.</NOTE> though
there be a De&s;cent of the Steams from the <HI>Nucleus</HI> towards the Sun, yet I al|ways
plainly &s;aw, that they quickly returned, and went contrary and oppo&s;ite to
the Suns, and that &s;ometimes to a prodigious Extent.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That this Gravitating and Levitating Power, in re&s;pect of the Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. This Gravi|tation and Le|vitatton ex|tends to and beyond the Earth.</NOTE>
doth extend even to the Earth, and beyond it, as will nece&s;&s;arily follow from the
Comet which appeared in the Year 1664, (to in&s;tance in no other) For 'twas
evident, that the Motion of that Comet was in a Line, without the Orb of the
Earth; and yet we found, that that Body was regulated in the &s;ame manner as
all the other Comets, and that its Blaze was extended in oppo&s;ition to the Body
of the Sun, and, as I &s;hall afterwards more particularly prove, was moved op|po&s;ite to it.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That there may be a Fire or Flame, and a burning or flaming Body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4. A flaming Body may be beyond the At|mo&s;phere.</NOTE>
in part of the Heavens far beyond the Atmo&s;phere, nay much farther off from
the Earth than the Body of the Moon it &s;elf; and con&s;equently that there may
be other Bodies of the &s;ame nature with the Earth, which may be much far|ther
off from the Earth than the Body of the Moon, nay much farther off the
Sun than either the Earth or Moon: And therefore it may be no great Ab&s;urdity
to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Body of the Moon may be of a Sub&s;tance not much diffe|ring
from the Sub&s;tance of the Earth, and &s;o may have many Proprieties, if not
the &s;ame, yet probably not much differing from it.</P>
<P>Fifthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5. The Power of Gravitation is extended far into the <HI>Aether &amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Ae|ther</HI> the Cau&s;|eof Gravitation.</NOTE> That the Power of Gravitation is extended into the <HI>Aether,</HI> without
the Atmo&s;phere of Bodies, and con&s;equently that the Atmo&s;phere or Air is not
the Cau&s;e of Gravitation, but rather the <HI>Aether,</HI> in which the Atmo&s;phere or
Air is but a kind of Di&s;&s;olution, as Salt or Tinctures are di&s;&s;olved in Water or
other Liquors, and that from thence comes even the Gravitation of the Atmo|&s;pheres
to their incompa&s;&s;ed Bodies; which we ob&s;erve by many other Experi|ments
made here upon the Earth: For 'tis evident that Bodies in a Receiver, ex|hau&s;ted
or empried of the Air by means of the exhau&s;ting Engine, or any other
ways, have not le&s;e of Gravity towards the Perpendicular or Center of the
Earth, than Bodies in the open and free Air; nay they are found to be propor|tionably
<PB N="169" REF="207">
heavier, by how much a Body of the Air, equal to them in bulk, has
been found to be lighter than them; which is an Experiment that has been often
try'd.</P>
<P>Sixthly, That the Air it &s;elf is no farther the <HI>Men&s;truum</HI> that di&s;&s;olves Bo|dies
by Fire and Flame,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6. The Air the Di&s;&s;olvent of Bodies by Fire, &s;o far as it has a Nitrous Spi|rit.</NOTE> than as it has &s;uch a kind of Body rai&s;ed from the
Earth, as has a Power of &s;o di&s;&s;olving and working on Unctuous, Sulphure|ous
or Combu&s;tible Bodies: And this is the Aerial or volatile Nitrous Spirit,
which, provided it be &s;upplied in the Body to be &s;o di&s;&s;olved, as by Fire, will
work the &s;ame effect, even without Air. This is obvious in Compo&s;itions made
with Salt of Nitre and other combu&s;tible Sub&s;tances, as in Gunpowder, and the
like, which will actually burn without the help of Air, as may be tried with it
under Water; nay in an exhau&s;ted Receiver, as I have often tried, wherein the
Effects are much the &s;ame, as if the &s;ame Accen&s;ions had been made in the open
and free Air; though where this Nitrous part is wanting, no Combu&s;tion, Di&s;|&s;olution
or actual Fire will be produced, be the Heat never &s;o great. Whence
we may deduce.</P>
<P>Seventhly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7. Two &s;orts of Particles in the Steams of Comets; 1&s;t A Nitrous.</NOTE> That in the Steams that i&s;&s;ue from the Cometical Body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2dly, A Su&s;|phureous.</NOTE> there are
two &s;orts at lea&s;t of Particles or particular Sub&s;tances: Namely, fir&s;t a Nitrous,
&s;uch as is every where to be found in our Air, and is perhaps that part which
may mo&s;t properly be called the Vital part thereof, which &s;upplies the <HI>Men|&s;truum</HI>
to burning and flaming Bodies; and that which continues the Life, Heat
and Motion of all Animals and Vegetables. Secondly an Unctuous or Sulphu|reous
Body, that is to di&s;&s;olved by it. Both which kinds of Bodies may be
actually in the Star or &s;olid Body, which I have &s;uppo&s;ed placed within the
cloudy <HI>Nucleus,</HI> which may &s;erve to continue the actual Fire once begun, and
may both be rarify'd into the Halituous Steams that compo&s;e the cloudy or hazy
Head and Blaze (which Particles, when emitted from the Body, may be &s;epa|rated,
and afterwards by convening together again, may produce an actual
Flame) and make tho&s;e Flashings and Flarings, which I &s;o often took notice of.</P>
<P>That there may be &s;uch kind of Effects produced,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Explication of Thunder and Lightning.</NOTE> I would argue from Ob|&s;ervations
which are commonly made here in the Atmo&s;phere near the Earth.
Every one has &s;een the Lightning and heard the Thunder here in the Air, and
many have endeavour'd to give a Solution and Explication thereof. But though
there be a va&s;t variety of Opinions and Hypothe&s;es concerning it, yet to me they
&s;eem every one of them to have mi&s;&s;ed the right. I &s;hall not trouble you to re|late
them here, &s;ince I have already declared my Opinion concerning them; nor
&s;hall I at pre&s;ent trouble you with &s;etting down many ab&s;urd Con&s;equences that
would follow from &s;uch their Hypothe&s;es, which would be quite incongruous
to the manife&s;t, if heeded, Appearances: But I &s;hall only tell you what, from
all the Ob&s;ervations. I have made concerning it, I conceive Thunder and Light|ning
to be, which whether it be congruous to the <HI>Phaenomona,</HI> and &s;ufficient to
explain them, I leave to the curious Ob&s;erver to judge. I have &s;hewed already,
that the Atmo&s;phere about the Earth doth abound with a &s;pirituous Nitre, or
Nitrous Particles, which are every where carried along with it; be&s;ides which
&s;ort of Nitrous Particles, there are al&s;o other Particles rai&s;ed up into the Atmo|&s;phere,
which may be &s;omewhat of the nature of &s;ulphureous, unctuous, or other
combu&s;tible Bodies; as we &s;ee Spirit of Wine, Spirit of Turpentine, Cam|phire,
and almo&s;t all other combu&s;tible Bodies, will by Heat be rarify'd into the
form of Air or Smoak, and be rai&s;ed up into the Air; all which, if they have a
&s;ufficient degree of Heat, will catch fire, that is, be di&s;&s;olved and turned into
Flame by the Nitrous Parts of the Air, as thou&s;ands of Experiments might be
brought to prove. There are al&s;o other &s;orts of the&s;e &s;ulphureous Steams,
which are rai&s;ed up from &s;ubterraneous and mineral Bodies, which only by their
coming to mix with the Nitrous Air (though they have no &s;en&s;ible Heat in them)
will &s;o ferment and act one upon another, as to prouduce an actual Flame; which has been often found in Mines; and more e&s;pecially if any part of them be kindled, the whole Train of them, intermingled with the Air contiguous,
will immediately take fire, like a Train of Gunpowder, and run from one end
<PB N="170" REF="208">
to the other of tho&s;e Vapours, be they never &s;o long, as I could prove by a Mul|titude
of Relations from the Cole-mines and &s;everal other Mines. The Accen|&s;ion
of which Vapours is &s;o &s;udden, and with &s;uch violence and &s;wiftne&s;s runs
from one end to the other, as often to kill the Miners, to blow up their Props,
Stays and Hou&s;es, and do as prodigious Effects as if a great quantity of Gun|powder
had been fired in the Mine. Now Lightning here in the Air I take to
be much of the like nature, that is to &s;ay, the Air or Atmo&s;phere about the
Earth is continually furni&s;ht with the &s;pirituous Nitrous Parts: Now the Heat
of Summer, whenever very extraordinary (as 'tis always Ob&s;erved to be before
Thunder and Lightning) rai&s;es up al&s;o out of the Earth a great quantity of &s;ul|phureous
Vapours, which are of &s;uch a nature, as that meeting with the Ni|trous
of the Air, they work upon each other, and thereby begin a farther degree
of Heat, which increa&s;es by certain Degrees &s;o long, till it arrive at a certain
pitch, at which pitch they actually fall on each other, and produce an actual
Fire or Flame, which &s;o &s;oon as ever it kindles, whereever it be placed in the
Train, it almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly fires the whole Train, and runs to the End with
&s;o great a Swiftne&s;s, that though I have ob&s;erved the Progre&s;s of it at three or
four Miles di&s;tance, as I have judged by the coming of the Sound to me, yet
have I &s;een this Train kindle or pa&s;s at lea&s;t a Miles di&s;tance in little more than
the quarter of a Minute of time. Now the Progre&s;s of the Fla&s;hes or Dart|ings
of Light out of the Comet do &s;eem to be much of the like nature; and
though the Progre&s;s of the Fla&s;h in the Comets be po&s;&s;ibly a thou&s;and times
more &s;wift; yet con&s;idering the va&s;t difference there is between the Air and the
<HI>Aether,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This applied to the Comets fla|&s;hing.</NOTE> I know not but that the Progre&s;s of the Accen&s;ion of Flame in the Light|ning
my be accounted as quick through the thick <HI>Medium</HI> of the Air, as that
of the Comet in the thinnner and more fluid <HI>Medium</HI> of the <HI>Aether.</HI></P>
<P>Eighthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8ly, The Mo|tion of Comets very rapid; therefore they are &s;oild.</NOTE> From the great Di&s;tance of the Comets, and the great Variation
of Place they &s;eem to make, we may collect that the Motion of them mu&s;t needs be very rapid, and to equalize the Swiftne&s;s even of the Earth it &s;elf, if not
much to exceed it; and con&s;equently to continue that Motion &s;o regular, one
would rationally &s;uppo&s;e it mu&s;t be as &s;olid as the Earth it &s;elf; or el&s;e that
the <HI>Aether</HI> has very little, if any, impeding Power to the Motion of &s;olid Bo|dies
through it.</P>
<P>Ninthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9thly, Yet the Parts of the <HI>Aether</HI> are den&s;er.</NOTE> That notwith&s;tanding this, yet there &s;eems to be rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e,
there is a greater Den&s;ity even of the Parts of the <HI>Aether</HI> it &s;elf; for other|wi&s;e
it &s;eems hard to conceive how there &s;hould be a Levitation of the flaming
Parts, and a Gravitation in re&s;pect of the Sun, of the other more &s;olid, as I
&s;hall afterwards prove more clearly by Con&s;equences drawn, not only from the
Form of their Motion, but from the more indi&s;putable Motion of the Planets.</P>
<P>Tenthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10thly, An Ac|celeration in le|vitating Bodies upwards.</NOTE> That there &s;eems to be a va&s;t Acceleration in the Motion of Levi|tating
Bodies (where the Motion is continued upwards) as well as there is of
Gravitating Bodies, where the Motion is continued downwards, and towards the
attracting Center: For though (as I have before mentioned) the exceeding &s;wift
Dartings and Fla&s;hings of the Light do rather &s;eem to be made by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
Accen&s;ion, like a Train of Gunpowder (and, as I have &s;uppo&s;ed, if not proved,
Lightning); yet to maintain &s;uch a Succe&s;&s;ion of Steams, there mu&s;t needs be
an exceeding quick Supply from the Head, even to the utmo&s;t Extremity of the
Blaze: And it looks not unlike to a kind of actual Levitation, or a driving
outwards of certain halituous Parts from the Sun, as if the Rays of Light of
the Sun were carried with a local Motion rapidly &s;wift, and in their Pa&s;&s;age by
the Star of the Comet, did carry with them &s;uch kind of halituous or fiery
Steams. The often ob&s;erving with my bare Eye the&s;e &s;udden Dartings of Light,
which &s;eemed to pa&s;s almo&s;t in a Second from the Head even to the End of the
Blaze, did often make me con&s;ider, whether the Rays of Light might not thence
be &s;uppo&s;ed to be moved away from the Sun with this exceedingly violent and
rapid Motion; e&s;pecially &s;ince there are &s;ome Ob&s;ervations of Mr. <HI>Romer</HI>'s a|bout
the Eclip&s;es of <HI>Jupiter Satellites,</HI> which &s;eem to make probable &s;uch a
Theory: But whether that does well accord with other Appearances, and whe|ther
<PB N="171" REF="209">
it may be allowed in the Theory of Light I have &s;uppo&s;ed, I &s;hall leave all
Per&s;ons free to judge. And as I de&s;ire they would give the liberty to &s;atisfy
my &s;elf in trying to make a Solution of the Appearances that I have hitherto
taken notice of by &s;ome Suppo&s;itions of my own, &s;o I &s;hall not endeavour to
per&s;uade any of them to leave their own, or be of my Opinion, where the Ap|pearances
them&s;elves, that I have mentioned, or they &s;hall ob&s;erve, &s;hall &s;eem not to make it po&s;itively nece&s;&s;ary: Since I doubt not but a more experienced,
more thinking, and more judicious Man, may plainly di&s;cover what to me is
as yet undetected.</P>
<P>For demonstrating the&s;e 10 Particulars I have named,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proofs of the 10 foregoing Particulars.</NOTE> and &s;everal others con|&s;equential
upon them, I judge it nece&s;&s;ary to demon&s;trate, as plainly as I am able (by the &s;mall Stock I have of Ob&s;ervations and Experiments, and &s;ome few Deductions I have made therefrom) <HI>Four Particulars.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That the va&s;t <HI>Expan&s;um</HI> of the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. The va&s;t <HI>Ex|pan&s;um</HI> is ex|ceeding fluid.</NOTE> that is, the whole Inter&s;tice
between the greater globular &s;olid Bodies thereof, is a Body exceedingly fluid, and &s;o fluid, as hardly to be able to hinder the Motion of any Solid through it,
much le&s;s of a Body of any con&s;iderable Bulk or Magnitude.</P>
<P>Secondly, That this exceedingly or indefinitely fluid <HI>Medium,</HI> though it do
not at all, or at mo&s;t very little, hinder the Motion of Bodies through it, is
yet notwith&s;tanding the <HI>Medium</HI> by which the Communication of the harmoni|ous
or inharmonious Motions of the more &s;olid Parts and Particles are commu|nicated to others at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; and that by means thereof both the
Motion of Light is propagated outwards, or from the &s;olid Body to all ima|ginable
Di&s;tance in Radiating Lines or Orbicular Pul&s;es, with unimaginable
Celerity: And al&s;o the Gravitation or Motion of De&s;cent from all imaginable
Di&s;tance towards the Radiating Body, of all &s;olid Bodies, is cau&s;ed and pro|duced
by the like Radiating Lines or Orbicular Pul&s;es rever&s;ed, with an unima|ginable
Celerity and prodigious Power.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3. A Body may burn in it.</NOTE> That this indefinitely or exceedingly fluid Body may be, and is a
<HI>Medium,</HI> in which a &s;olid compound Body of proper Materials may be fired
and kindled into an actual Fire and Flame, and may be continued in that State
&s;o long as the &s;aid Materials &s;hall la&s;t, and other Circum&s;tances do not hinder;
and may have its Flame and Steams a&s;cend, and its more &s;olid Parts de&s;cend.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4. The Propor|tion of the&s;e Motions.</NOTE> That the Motion of A&s;cent and De&s;cent herein is continually in|crea&s;ed
and augmented in a proportion more than duplicate downwards, and le&s;s
than duplicate upwards, of the proportion of the Times; which Proportion
&s;hall be determined and demon&s;trated.</P>
<P>For the proving, or at lea&s;t making very probable of which four Proprieties
of &s;o va&s;t a Body, and of the Parts of it at &s;o great a Di&s;tance, and of a Body
&s;o altogether in&s;en&s;ible to our Organs, any otherwi&s;e but by a Series of &s;everal
Con&s;equences, it cannot be expected I &s;hould produce a &s;en&s;ible and undeniable
Demon&s;tration and yet when the Coherence of all the Con&s;equences, that will
nece&s;&s;arily and naturally flow from this Doctrine and Theory, &s;hall be con&s;ider'd,
I hope it may produce other Thoughts and Arguments, in other Mens Minds,
far more cogent than I am able to produce.</P>
<P>Now that I may not be mi&s;taken in my Expre&s;&s;ions, and that the Words I
make u&s;e of, which are commonly u&s;ed, but by various Men are under&s;tood to
&s;ignify various and very differing Notions, I would willingly explain in what
&s;en&s;e I under&s;tand them, and what Notions I would willingly have them to com|municate, when made u&s;e of by me.</P>
<P>I conceive then the Whole of Realities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whatever af|fects our Sen&s;es&punc; is Body and Motion. Bod$ what.</NOTE> that any ways affect our Sen&s;es, to
be Body and Motion. By Body I conceive nothing el&s;e but a Reality that has
Exten&s;ion every way, po&s;itive and immutable, not as to Figure, but as to
Quan|tity;
and that the Body, as Body, is the &s;ame, whatever Figure it be of: As a
Quart of Water is a Quart of Water, of a certain quantity of Body, though
contained in a Globe, Cylinder, Cone, Cube, Quart Pot, or any other figured
<PB N="172" REF="210">
containing Ve&s;&s;el: And as Body, it is indifferent to receive any Figure whatever;
nor has it more Exten&s;ion in one than in the other Ve&s;&s;el, nor can it have le&s;s;
nor is it more e&s;&s;entially a Body, when &s;olid, as Ice, than when fluid; that is,
the Minims of it are equally di&s;po&s;ed to Motion or Re&s;t in po&s;ition to each o|ther;
and therefore Body, as Body, may as well be, or be &s;uppo&s;ed to be inde|finitely
fluid, at definitely &s;olid; and con&s;equently there is no nece&s;&s;ity to &s;up|po&s;e
Atoms, or any determinate part of Body perfectly &s;olid, or&punc; &s;uch who&s;e
Parts are uncapable of changing po&s;ition one to another; &s;ince, as I conceive,
the E&s;&s;ence of Body is only determinate Exten&s;ion, or a Power of being unalte|rably
of &s;uch a Quantity, and not a Power of being and continuing of a deter|minate
Quantity and a determinate Figure, which the Anatomi&s;ts &s;uppo&s;e. The&s;e
I conceive the two Powers or Principles of the World, to Body and Mo|tion;
Uniformity of Motion making a Solid, and Difformity of the Motion of
the Parts making a Fluid, as I &s;hall prove more at large by and by.</P>
<P>By Motion I under&s;tand nothing but an Alteration, or Power of Alteration,
of the Minims of a Whole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Motion what.</NOTE> in re&s;pect of one another, which Power may be
increa&s;ed or dimini&s;hed in any a&s;&s;ignable Quantity; but the natural Ballance of
the Univer&s;e is reciprocal to the Bulk or Exten&s;ion, or to the Quantity of the o|ther
Power, Body.</P>
<P>The&s;e two I take to be two &s;ingle Powers, which co operate in effecting the
mo&s;t of the &s;en&s;ible and in&s;en&s;ible Effects of the World. Of the &s;en&s;ible Ef|fects
I am a&s;certain'd by &s;en&s;ible Experiments and Ob&s;ervations;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The&s;e two Pow|ers immutable, but by the Pow|er that made them.</NOTE> and of the in|&s;en&s;ible
I have a Probability from the Similitude, Harmony and Uniformity in
the Operations of Nature.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e Powers I take to be the immediate Product of the Omnipotent
Creator, and immutable in them&s;elves, without a like Command of the &s;ame
Power; and always to act in a regular and Uniform Geometrical or Mechanical
Method; which Method by diligent Ob&s;ervations and curious Scrutiny may by
natural and artificial Means be di&s;covered, and, as I conceive, reduced under
certain Rules, and Geometrically demonstrated. The doing of which I take to
be the true end of the Science of Phy&s;icks, or of Natural and Expeimental
Philo&s;ophy; and all artificial Inquiries tending hereunto, I conceive to tend
to the Advancement of the Knowledge of Art and Nature.</P>
<P>The&s;e are as it were the <HI>Male</HI> and <HI>Female</HI> of Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fir&s;t Prin|ciple, Matter.</NOTE> from the Co-operations
of which the mo&s;t of Natural Productions are effected. The fir&s;t is, as it were,
the Female or Mother Principle, and is therefore lightly called by <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and
other Philo&s;ophers, <HI>Materia,</HI> Material Sub&s;tance, or <HI>Mater;</HI> this being in it
&s;elf, ab&s;tractly con&s;ider'd, without Life or Motion, without form, and void,
and dark, a Power in it &s;elf wholly unactive, until it be, as it were, impreg|nated
by the &s;econd Principle, which may repre&s;ent the <HI>Pater,</HI> and may be call'd
<HI>Paternus, Spiritus</HI> or hylarchick Spirit, as &s;ome call it, without who&s;e Con|junction
nothing, or no Alteration can be produced: For neither can Matter
without Motion, nor Motion without Matter, produce any Effect. As for <HI>Mat|ter</HI>
that I conceive in its E&s;&s;ence to be immutable, and its E&s;&s;ence being Expa|tiation
determinate, it cannot be alter'd in its Quantity either by Conden&s;ation
or Rarefaction; that is, there cannot be more or le&s;s of that Power or Reality,
whatever it be, within the &s;ame Expatiation or Content; but every equal Expa|tiation
contains, is filled, or is an equal quantity of <HI>Materia;</HI> and the den&s;e&s;t
or heavie&s;t, or moll: powerful Body in the World contains no more <HI>Materia</HI>
than that which we conceive to be the rare&s;t, thinne&s;t, lighte&s;t, or lea&s;t
powerful Body of all: As Gold, for in&s;tance, and <HI>Aether</HI> or the
Sub&s;tance
that fills the Cavity of an exhau&s;ted Ve&s;&s;el, or the Cavity of the Gla&s;s
of a Barometer above the Quick&s;ilver. Nay, as I &s;hall afterwards prove,
this Cavity is more full, or a more den&s;e Body of <HI>Aether,</HI> in the com|mon
Sen&s;e or Acceptation of the Word, than the Gold is of Gold, Bulk for
Bulk; and that becau&s;e the one, <HI>viz.</HI> the Ma&s;s of <HI>Aether,</HI> is all <HI>Aether;</HI> but
the Ma&s;s of Gold, which we conceive, is not all Gold, but there is an Inter|mixture,
and that va&s;tly more than is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, of <HI>Aether</HI> with it:
So that the Vacuity, as it is commonly thought, or erroneou&s;ly &s;uppo&s;ed, is a
more den&s;e Body than the Gold as Gold. But if we con&s;ider the quantity of
the whole Content of the one with that of the other, within the &s;ame or equal
<PB N="173" REF="211">
quantity of Expatiation, then are they both equally containing the <HI>Materia</HI> or
Body.</P>
<P>This po&s;&s;ibly may at fir&s;t hearing &s;eem a little paradoxical, if not ab&s;urd;
however I doubt not but that by the Sequel of my Di&s;cour&s;e I &s;hall be able to
make it &s;omewhat more plau&s;ible, if not po&s;itively and undeniably demon&s;trate
it &s;o to be.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Principle or Power, which is <HI>Motion,</HI> is of a quite differing na|ture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;econd Prin|ciple, Motion.</NOTE>
and may be rarified and conden&s;ed, dimini&s;hed or increa&s;ed, within the
&s;ame quantity of <HI>Body</HI> or <HI>Matter,</HI> in any proportion a&s;&s;igned; that is, the &s;ame
quantity of the 1&s;t Power <HI>Body,</HI> or part of <HI>Matter,</HI> may receive any a&s;&s;ignable
quantity of the 2d, that is, any a&s;&s;ignable Degree of <HI>Motion;</HI> and being po&s;&s;e&s;t
of it, it may communicate or lo&s;e any a&s;&s;ignable part of what it has, and &s;till
the Body, as Body, remain unalter'd and the &s;ame: For as it may be moved
with any Motion, how &s;wift &s;oever it $e &s;uppo&s;ed; &s;o may it move with inde|finitely
&s;low Motions, and that &s;o far, as that the next &s;tep one would &s;uppo&s;e
it mu&s;t lo&s;e all its Motion, and remain in intire Re&s;t, and unalterable of Po&s;ition,
as to the contiguous Body.</P>
<P>It may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;till demanded, what is <HI>Matter,</HI> and what is <HI>Motion?</HI> To
which I can only an&s;wer, That they are what they are; Powers created by the
Omnipotent to be what they are, and to operate as they do; which are unalte|rable
in the whole, either by Addition or Sub&s;traction, by any other Power but
the &s;ame that at fir&s;t made them to be what they are and what partial Altera|tions
or Compo&s;itions are by them produced, they flow from that Omnipotent
Wi&s;dom, that ordered them &s;o to do: And the&s;e are tho&s;e which we call the
Laws of Nature; which though at fir&s;t glance they &s;eem wholly un&s;earch|able
and incomprehensible, yet God has planted in Man a Faculty by which,
I conceive, he has a Power of under&s;tanding and finding out, by and according
to what Order, Rule, Method, or Law, they act, and produce the Effects that
are produced by them. And this I conceive to be that we call Natural Know|ledge,
and our Advance in this Inquiry, I conceive to be that which we call the
Improvement of Natural Knowledge, and the nearer we can approach from the
lowe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Effects, to higher and higher Steps of Cau&s;es, the near|er
&s;hall we be to the highe&s;t and utmo&s;t pitch that human Nature is capable of
arriving at.</P>
<P>I have in my Inquiries various and &s;undry ways attempted to a&s;cend by
the <HI>Synthetick</HI> Method, and as many ways attempted the contrary, or <HI>Analytick</HI>
way, and &s;hall therefore in &s;ome of my en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;es give &s;ome <HI>Specimina</HI>
of each, which though they may have their Failings, and come &s;hort of what
may be done by others, yet I hope they may appear to have been regularly and
&s;trictly pro&s;ecuted: And this I am now upon, though it &s;hould not prove the
true, may yet be of &s;ome &s;uch u&s;e, as the Rule in Arithmetick called fal&s;e Po|&s;ition,
for the finding by the wrong Product what is more likely to be the true
one.</P>
<P>Various have been the Attempts of &s;everal Philo&s;ophers, both antient and mo|dern,
to begin this <HI>Analytical</HI> way, which would be too tedious to repeat at this
time; yet whether it be for that we have not a true, or at be&s;t but a very imper|fect
Account of what they were, we do not find that Satisfaction from the Pro|duct
of them in the conclu&s;ion, which an inqui&s;itive and &s;tri&s;t Examiner would
expect, the String and Series of the <HI>Analy&s;is</HI> being broken and imperfect, and not
carried on through all the Steps of De&s;cent, as it ought to be; which will be
more difficult to &s;upply than the Effect will po&s;&s;ibly be valuable, unle&s;s we had
a more full Account of what were their fir&s;t and fundamental Po&s;itions. And
though even this has been an Undertaking not left unattempted by &s;everal of the
more modern Writers, yet whether &s;uch Attempts have been altogether &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sful
as is de&s;irable, I mu&s;t leave to tho&s;e that have examined them to
judge.</P>
<P>Others there have been, and that much a greater number, who have gone the
other way, and have been dabling in this or that particular Subject, and have
been &s;o blinded with &s;ome little things they have therein met with, that they
pre&s;ently &s;quare all the re&s;t of Nature to their Rule. Such as the&s;e are too
ha&s;ty in their Conclu&s;ions, and think to run away with that which they are far
enough from attaining. The 4 Elements, the 3 Chymical Principles, Magne|neti&s;m,
<PB N="174" REF="212">
Sympathy, Fermentation, Alkaly and Acid, and divers other Chimera's,
too many to repeat; which having been embraced, nothing el&s;e will be heard,
or go down with them; whereas, ala&s;s, Nature perhaps knows no one of the&s;e
for a Principle in any &s;en&s;e, much le&s;s in that which they under&s;tand it. Of
which I &s;hall &s;ay more el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>But to proceed, this Suppo&s;ition of the two fundamental and primary Powers,
to wit, that of <HI>Matter,</HI> and that of <HI>Motion,</HI> which I have here delivered,
&s;eems to me very con&s;onant to the Sen&s;e I under&s;tand of the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Ge|ne&s;is</HI>
of the World, delivered by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the fir&s;t Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is:</HI> And
though the Words of that Hi&s;tory be by divers Authors very differingly ex|plain'd
and applied, yet by &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idering of them, I conceive they may
genuinely bear this Sen&s;e al&s;o in which I &s;hall here mention them.</P>
<P>The words of the 1&s;t Ver&s;e, as render'd in our <HI>English,</HI> are:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A brief inter|terpretation of the beginning of <HI>Gene&s;is.</HI></NOTE> <HI>In the beginning
God created the Heaven and the Earth:</HI> In the <HI>Hebrew</HI> 'tis, <HI>the Heavens;</HI> but the
<HI>Greek, Samaritan</HI> and <HI>Arabick</HI> render it only the <HI>Heaven.</HI> The <HI>Syriack</HI>
renders it, <HI>the Being of Heaven and the Being of Earth:</HI> But the <HI>Arabick</HI> ren|ders
it thus: The fir&s;t thing that God created was <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth.</HI> Which
Expre&s;&s;ion does &s;eem to &s;ignify the fir&s;t Power that I have mentioned, namely,
the <HI>Matter</HI> or <HI>Mater,</HI> the whole Sub&s;tance of the Heavens and the Earth; that
is, that Sub&s;tance, which being afterwards informed and qualified by <HI>Motion,</HI>
con&s;tituted the Heavens and the Earth. For it &s;eems by the next Ver&s;e to be
for &s;ome time without the Impregnation of the &s;econd Principle, <HI>Motion;</HI> for
'tis &s;aid, <HI>the Earth was without form, and void, and Darkne&s;s was upon the Face
of the Deep,</HI> or the Aby&s;s. The <HI>Hebrew</HI> is, <HI>De&s;ertne&s;s and Inanity.</HI> The <HI>Greek</HI>
renders it <HI>invi&s;ible and incompo&s;ed.</HI> The <HI>Targum, de&s;ert and void.</HI> The <HI>Ara|bick</HI>
renders it, <HI>covered with the Aby&s;s, and overwhelmed with the Sea.</HI> And the
Original, and all the Tran&s;lations, agree in the Darkne&s;s upon the Face of the
Aby&s;s. All which Expre&s;&s;ions &s;eem to &s;ignify, that the <HI>Mater</HI> of Heaven and
Earth was yet without any kind of <HI>Motion</HI> in it, but like that imaginary Entity
we call Vacuity or Space; which was without any moving or acting Power in it,
but had as yet only the Power of Expan&s;ion, Exten&s;ion, or Expatiation: For
this is what we under&s;tand by the Notion of <HI>Vacuum</HI> or Space and &s;o is Dark|ne&s;s,
namely, a Defect of the Motion of Light: For Light, as I have already
by many Arguments and Experiments proved, is a Motion, and that a regular,
uniform, and truly Geometrical Motion. So that the Sen&s;e of the &s;econd Ver&s;e
to me &s;eems to be this, That the <HI>Mater</HI> out of which the Earth, or all the Solids
in the World were afterwards made, was yet only a pure <HI>Mater,</HI> or extended
Sub&s;tance, and of the &s;ame nature with the Aby&s;s, which had not in it the
2d Power <HI>Motion;</HI> but was dark, without the Motion of Light, without Form;
that is, without the Power of Motion, that makes Forms; de&s;ert of Quality,
Life, Action, or Di&s;tinction; wanting yet Motion, which maketh all the Di|&s;tinction,
Quality and Action that is in the World. Then follows the next Words,
which &s;eem to &s;ignify the Creation, or Infu&s;ion of this &s;econd Power <HI>Motion.
And the Spirit of God moved upon the Face of the Waters.</HI> The Original is, <HI>And
the Spirit of God did move upon the Faces of the Waters.</HI> The <HI>Targum</HI> is, <HI>And
a Spirit from the Con&s;pectu of God did blow in upon the Face of the Waters.</HI> The <HI>Sa|maritan</HI>
renders it, <HI>And the Spirit of God was carried upon the Face of the Waters.</HI>
The <HI>Syriack</HI> renders it, <HI>And the Spirit of God did incubare, or brood, upon the Su|perficies
of the Waters.</HI> The <HI>Arabick, And the Winds of God did blow upon the
Face of Water.</HI> All which &s;everal Readings do &s;eem to &s;ignify the Creation and
Production of the &s;econd Power, <HI>Motion.</HI> For fir&s;t, 'tis mo&s;t
properly called a
<HI>Spirit,</HI> &s;ignifying its Power of moving, by which Property only we know it.
Next, it is &s;aid to move, or be moved, or blown in or carried upon the Face or
Superficies of the Waters. The <HI>Mater</HI> was now no longer dead, and unactive,
and Earth, but it became a Fluid, &s;ignified by Water. For, as I &s;hall after|wards
&s;hew, it mu&s;t in this Place be &s;o taken, and not only for the Sub&s;tance
Water, but that God joining the &s;econd Power <HI>Motion,</HI> and impregnating the
<HI>Mater</HI> with it, made every <HI>Minim</HI> of it to move with infinite Varieties of Mo|tions:
And &s;o all tho&s;e which before lay &s;till, and changed not their Places and
Po&s;itions in re&s;pect of one another, and were therefore called Earth, are now
by this In&s;ufflation, Incubation, or acting of the Spirit of God upon the Super|ficcies,
<PB N="175" REF="213">
become a perfect Fluid, or a Water. No two contiguous <HI>Minims</HI> yet
agree in Unity or Uniformity of Motion. And hitherto &s;eems to be the Hi&s;to|ry
of the Creation, or making of the two fir&s;t Powers, <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Motion,
Body</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> or <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Form.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place follows the De&s;cription of the two great Laws of Motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The two great Laws of Mo|toon, Light an$ Gravity. 1. Light.</NOTE>
which con&s;titute the Form and Order of the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or World. The fir&s;t is $hat
of <HI>Light,</HI> and the &s;econd is that of <HI>Gravity.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t for that of <HI>Light,</HI> which is the fir&s;t regular Motion, or Rule of
Nature, which is that regular Propagation of Motion, which, as I have for|merly
explain'd, extends it &s;elf in&s;tantaneou&s;ly through the Whole of Matter&punc;
We find in the third Ver&s;e, <HI>And God &s;aid, Let there be Light, and there was
Light, and God divided the Light from the Darkne&s;s.</HI> Whereby we find, that
the fir&s;t Regulation of Motion was the Principle of <HI>Light;</HI> which &s;eems to
&s;ignify, that this Propriety of the fluid Matter was then fir&s;t implanted, by
which the &s;imilar Parts of it were made fit to propagate the Pul&s;e of <HI>Light</HI> to
all imaginable Di&s;tance; and this Sub&s;tance was di&s;tingui&s;hed from that other
Sub&s;tance, which would not propagate it, which was opaque and dark: For as
yet we find neither the <HI>Sun</HI> nor <HI>Stars</HI> were made, nor the <HI>Earth</HI> it &s;elf formed
but only a Qualification of Matter fit for the performing of tho&s;e Functions,
which were accordingly made di&s;tinct, and &s;econdarily implanted: <HI>And God &s;aid, Let there be an Expan&s;um, or a Firmament, and let it divide the Waters
from the Waters.</HI> This &s;eems to &s;ignify the &s;econd general and grand Rule of
Natural Motion, namely, <HI>Gravity.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Gravity.</NOTE> For this Expan&s;ion or Firmament is &s;aid to
divide the Waters from the Waters, or one Fluid from another; for &s;o the
Word <HI>Maim</HI> &s;eems to &s;ignify. And this made all tho&s;e Fluids which were of a
Terre&s;trial Nature, to congregate or gather together into the Ma&s;s of the Earth,
or Earths; and the other of a more Cele&s;tial Nature, to gather together in the
Sun and Stars. And this Expan&s;ion or Firmament, which was the exten&s;ive
Power of Gravitation, was that which cau&s;ed tho&s;e Effects. The&s;e two Powers
&s;eem to constitute the Souls of the greater Bodies of the World, <HI>viz.</HI> the Sun
and Stars, and the Planets, both &s;uch as move about the Sun, and &s;uch as move
about any other Central Body: And both the&s;e are to be found in every &s;uch
Body in the World; but in &s;ome more, in &s;ome le&s;s, in &s;ome one is predomi|nant,
in others the other; but no one without &s;ome Degree of both: For as
there is none without the Principle of <HI>Gravitation,</HI> &s;o there is none without
&s;ome degree of <HI>Light.</HI> And though &s;ome doe not &s;hew its Effects in producing
Light immediately, yet I &s;hall make it probable that it has that Motion blend|ed
with others, which hinder it from producing Effects, but yet do not wholly
de&s;troy the Principle. And this I &s;hall make the more probable, when I &s;hall
&s;hew how both the&s;e Powers are but di&s;tinct Effects produced by one and the
&s;ame Power, and that this Power is implanted in every &s;uch great Globular Bo|dy
in the World. I could go on through the whole Hi&s;tory delivered in this fir&s;t
Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> but that I only aimed at pre&s;ent to &s;hew, that nothing of
what I have hitherto &s;uppo&s;ed, does any ways di&s;agree with Holy Writ, but
rather, that it is perfectly con&s;onant to that, as well as it is to Rea&s;on, and the
Nature of things them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I have often made u&s;e of the Words <HI>Maximum</HI> and <HI>Minimum,</HI> or of the<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Maximum</HI> and <HI>Minimum,</HI> in what &s;en&s;e taken.</NOTE>
Greate&s;t and the Lea&s;t; and becau&s;e there are various Opinions concerning the
Significancy of tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, &s;ome under&s;tanding them in one &s;en&s;e, and
&s;ome in another, I would willingly have it under&s;tood in what &s;en&s;e I make u&s;e
of them.</P>
<P>By the Words <HI>Maximum</HI> and <HI>Minimum,</HI> or the Greate&s;t and the Lea&s;t, I un|der&s;tand
then only the greate&s;t and the lea&s;t Exten&s;ion or Motion we have need
to make u&s;e of in &s;peaking or &s;uppo&s;ing, which will &s;till be bounded: For In|finite
or Unbounded cannot have an Idea formed in our Imagination or Memo|ry,
which mu&s;t always have a bounded Idea, being material: And this bounded
Idea, however by comparing and rea&s;oning we may &s;uppo&s;e it differing; yet it is never bigger or le&s;s in reality, than the bigge&s;t Appearance we have had of the
Heavens, or the lea&s;t Appearance we have had of a vi&s;ible of other &s;en&s;ible Point.
The&s;e Ideas therefore of <HI>Maximum</HI> and <HI>Minimum,</HI> made u&s;e of in Di&s;cour&s;e and
Rea&s;oning, are compound Ideas, and con&s;i&s;t of the &s;imple Ideas of the &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="176" REF="214">
<HI>Maximum</HI> and <HI>Minimum,</HI> with a Proportion annexed. For, as much as the Idea
of the <HI>Maximum</HI> does exceed the Idea of the <HI>Minimum</HI> brought in by the Sen&s;e;
&s;o much do we &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Minimum</HI> to exceed another <HI>Minimum,</HI> of which we
would make a &s;ingle Idea, but we cannot; but it will always be a compounded
or comparative Idea; and &s;o <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;</HI> of the <HI>Maximum.</HI> For neither can we
form a &s;imple Idea of any thing that is a Million of Millions of times le&s;s than
the Idea of the lea&s;t vi&s;ible Point; nor can we form an Idea of a <HI>Maximum,</HI>
which is Millions of Millions bigger than the imaginary bigne&s;s of the Heavens
we fee; but by Compo&s;ition, and Compari&s;on, and Proportion, we make the
compounded Ideas, which &s;uffice for a Material to be made u&s;e of in Rea&s;on|ing. And when all comes to all, we do but rea&s;on upon the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> in our own
Repo&s;itory or Memory, which contains certain Ideas, Forms, Pictures or Marks,
we our &s;elves have made of &s;imple &s;en&s;ations; which are originally begun from
Motions without, but compleated, fini&s;hed and di&s;po&s;ed of within our &s;elves,
by the Power and Activity of the Soul; from whence proceeds that Difference
which is to be found in the Imaginations and Rea&s;onings of &s;everal Men: For
the things of Nature are the &s;ame, and the Informations are conveyed by the
&s;ame <HI>Media,</HI> and in the &s;ame Manner; yet partly the Organs of Men differ
con&s;iderably in their Perfections; but chiefly the inward Parts of the Organ of
Memory, and the natural or acquired Habits of the Soul in Imagination and
Rea&s;oning, are exceeding different. Some men have a more piercing Sight, and
can di&s;tingui&s;h a much &s;maller Point than others, po&s;&s;ibly from the Tunicles and
Humours of the Eye, their exceeding Clearne&s;s and Tran&s;parency, and Exactne&s;s
of Figure; po&s;&s;ibly al&s;o from the Finene&s;s and excellent Structure of the &s;en&s;ibie
Part, and Optick Nerve, and Parts of the Brain &s;erving to that purpo&s;e, and
from the Habit, U&s;e and Exerci&s;e of tho&s;e Parts and Faculties: But &s;till in
the be&s;t, the <HI>Minimum</HI> and the <HI>Maximum vi&s;ibile</HI> is limited, it can be no more
than a Hemi&s;phere of the Eye, nor &s;maller than a Point of the Eye, which to
every Man is a&s;&s;ignable; and whatever other Idea is formed to expre&s;s a le&s;s or
a bigger, is a compounded or proportionate Idea, and will be plainly di&s;cover'd
&s;o to be by any one that will but &s;eriou&s;ly &s;o con&s;ider it.</P>
<P>But to leave this Digre&s;&s;ion, and proceed by various Enquiries in the Synthe|tick
way, or by rea&s;oning, and proceeding from &s;en&s;ible Ob&s;ervations and Expe|riments,
to the more in&s;en&s;ible Operations of Nature; I have already &s;hewed
Light to be a continued Pul&s;e or Motion propagated through a Diaphanous <HI>Me|dium</HI>
to all imaginable Di&s;tance <HI>in orbem;</HI> and by this means to continually agi|tate
and make fluid, vivify and regulate the greate&s;t part of the Univer&s;e. I
have already &s;hewed all its various ways of moving and cro&s;&s;ing each other, and
the harmonious Chime, as it were, of the Pul$ations of &s;everal Luminous Points
or Bodies, and therefore &s;hall not here repeat them any further than only naming,
As fir&s;t, that Light makes all things &s;en&s;ible to the Eye: next, that &s;uch a Mo|tion
cau&s;es Heat, produces and contiues Fluidity and Solidity; producing Union
and Separation; Union of homogeneous, and Separation of heterogeneous Bo|dies.
The&s;e, I &s;ay, I have already pretty largely explain'd; and therefore I
&s;hall leave the further Explanation of it to a more proper Place, and proceed
to the next Principle, <HI>Gravity,</HI> becau&s;e I find that Principle to &s;eem the more
new and &s;trange to &s;ome Per&s;ons; and I would willingly remove &s;uch Difficul|ties
as occur,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Effects of the Motion of Light.</NOTE> before I proceed, becau&s;e otherwi&s;e there will be a he&s;itancy in all
that follows.</P>
<P>By <HI>Gravity</HI> then I under&s;tand &s;uch a Power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is under|&s;tood by Gra|vity.</NOTE> as cau&s;es Bodies of a &s;imilar or homogeneous nature to be moved one towards the other, till they are united; or
&s;uch a Power as always impels or drives, attracts or impre&s;&s;es Motion into them,
that tends that way, or makes them unite. The Univer&s;ality of this Principle,
throughout the whole and every thing therein, I &s;hall afterwards have more occa|&s;ion to explain, when I come to the Effects of Nature in le&s;&s;er Bodies.
At pre|&s;ent I &s;hall only proceed to &s;hew it in the greater Bodies of the World.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, that there is &s;uch a Power in the Earth, in re&s;pect of terre&s;trial
Bodies, I think no one will deny in the general. Some Di&s;putes there have
been, I con&s;e&s;s, among Philo&s;ophers, concerning the Nature of the Power it &s;elf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. That there is &s;uch a thing.</NOTE>
and &s;ome concerning the Subject in which it is inherent: Some &s;uppo&s;ing it to
<PB N="177" REF="215">
be a <HI>Spirit,</HI> an <HI>hylarchick Spirit;</HI> others &s;uppo&s;ing it an <HI>innate Quality,</HI> or inhe|rent
tendency to the Center of the World, not as 'tis the Center of the Earth,
but as it is the lowe&s;t Place in the Univer&s;e, and farthest removed from the Hea|vens,
and from the more Spirituous and moving Bodies; and &s;o is &s;uppo&s;ed the
wor&s;t of Places, and made $it only to receive the Dregs of the Univer&s;e: And
were the Body of the Earth there, or not there; yet thither would all the&s;e dull
and earthy Bodies, that we now find de&s;cend, tend, and there remain. Others
&s;uppo&s;e this Power placed in the <HI>Aether,</HI> and that by the Rotation thereof mak|ing
it tend outward, the more &s;olid Bodies, which con&s;i&s;t of more bulky Parts
than the <HI>Aether,</HI> are driven downwards. Others 'place it in the <HI>Earth</HI> it &s;elf, which
they &s;uppo&s;e like a great <HI>Load&s;tone,</HI> and to &s;end forth certain Chains of uncous
or hooked Particles, which pull down all Terre&s;trial Bodies out of the Air, or
from any higher to any lower Place: And many other &s;uch Fictions and <HI>Chime|ra's,</HI>
which &s;erve only to inform us what kind of Notions and Imaginations
tho&s;e Men had in their own Minds; but in no wife to inform us of what the
Power is, or in what manner it operates. Only this farther we may collect from
them all, that every one of them took it for granted, that heavy and terre&s;trial
Bodies were by &s;ome Power moved towards the Center of the Earth, whether
their particular Notions concerning that Power were right or not.</P>
<P>Next, there have been as many differing Opinions concerning the Limits of
this Power:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of its Limits upwards.</NOTE> Some extending it too far, and others as extravagantly too little:
Some &s;uppo&s;ing, that where&s;oever in the Univer&s;e a terre&s;trial Body &s;hould be
placed, there it would have a tendency towards the Center of the World or
Earth; and therefore that in the Creation, all the Terre&s;trial Matter of the <HI>Chaos</HI>
met together, and made up the Body of the Earth. Others, on the other hand,
have been too penurious in limiting its Power to &s;ome few Miles; &s;ome to 50
Miles, others to a Boundary, that a Cannon well charg'd with Powder would
be able to &s;hoot a Bullet out of its reach. But though they are both enough
mi&s;taken, yet they agree in this, that this Power of Gravitation does act at &s;ome
di&s;tance above the Surface of the Earth.</P>
<P>Others differ again about the Modes and Limits of its working within the
Body of the Earth below its Surface;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Modes and Limits of its working be|low the Surface of the Earth.</NOTE> but no one I have yet met with &s;eems to
me to have hit upon a right Notion concerning it; and yet all agree in this, that there is &s;uch a Power &s;omewhere placed, that does act regularly, and within &s;ome
certain Limits. I could proceed farther to mention their Explanations; but I
conceive they would be too long, and not much to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In the next place, this Power acts regularly and uniformly. I argue its Regu|larity or Uniformity of acting on all &s;ides or &s;uperficial Parts of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. it acts regu|latly.</NOTE> from
the Spherical Surface of the Sea; and that from the Shadow of the Earth in
Eclip&s;es of the Moon, where the Picture of Shadow of it is found to be round:
And therefore though I cannot without very much trouble here upon the Earth,
be a&s;certain'd of the Uniformity or Equality of the Power of Gravity working
every way nearly towards the Center of the Earth; and though I cannot a$cend
high enough, tho' I &s;hould get to the top of the hig$e&s;t Mountain in the World,
to have a certainty from In&s;pection or Sight: Yet this alone, of the rounde&s;s of
the Shadow in Eclip&s;es, is Argument enough to per&s;uade any unprejudiced Per&s;on
from disbelieving it, as a Matter very unlikely; though it be not &s;ufficient to
prove its Geometrical Roundne&s;s, which mu&s;t be proved by other <HI>Mediums.</HI> Be|&s;ides,
we find that it mu&s;t be very near round, and con&s;equently have very near
uniform Gravitation, from the general Ob&s;ervations of Navigators, who do find,
that &s;o many Leagues &s;ailed Northwards or S$uthwards, do alter a Degree of
Latitude; which were the Gravitation not pretty near equal, it would not &s;o
happen. 'Tis po&s;&s;ible, by very accurate trial, the Truth and Certainty thereof
might be po&s;itively proved and determined; but 'twill require more than my
Opportunities will reach unto at pre&s;ent, to do it, though I can &s;hew how. It were de&s;irable however, that it were once for all accurately tried.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why I in&s;i&s;t &s;o much upon this Argument of the Roundne&s;s of the
Figure of the Earth, is, becau&s;e I take this Roundne&s;s to be as convincing an
Argument as any, to prove that there is the like Power in every Globular Cele|&s;tial Body, as there is in the Earth&punc; For &s;ince all the Cele&s;tial Bodies, who&s;e
<PB N="178" REF="216">
Shape we are able to di&s;cover, are found to be of a Globular Figure, as is the
Earth, and that &s;everal of them do turn round upon their <HI>Axes</HI> (as we find
beyond doubt that the Sun and <HI>Jupiter</HI> do) were there not in them &s;uch a gra|vitating
Power, all the loo&s;e Parts of their Bodies mu&s;t&punc; be &s;hot out from them,
or thrown away like a Stone out of a Sling &s;wung round, or the loo&s;e Parts
&s;ticking to a Wheel or Top, when whirled round; and con&s;equently&punc; they mu&s;t
in a little time be di&s;per&s;ed and &s;hattered to pieces. But no &s;uch Appearance
has ever been ob&s;erved: Therefore it is an Argument that there is &s;uch a Power
in tho&s;e round Bodies of the <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which keep tho&s;e moveable Par$s
from flying off. For that the Sun has moveable Parts, is evident by the Di&s;co|very
of our Tele&s;copes, which &s;hew us various &s;orts of Spots; which Spots,
whether they be Clouds of Smoke, or more opaque&punc; Parts that ri&s;e out of the
Body it &s;elf, and only float on a fluid part of the Body of the <HI>Sun,</HI> like the
<HI>Scoria</HI> or Dro&s;s of red-hot melted Mettal, is not yet determined: And 'tis mo&s;t
probable they are of the former nature, by the various Circum&s;tances that have
been taken notice of; but be they which &s;oever, yet the whirling of the Sun
would throw them off, were there not &s;uch an attracting Power that kept them
from receding, &s;ince 'tis evident they are loo&s;e from the re&s;t of the Body. The
like may be &s;aid for <HI>Jupiter,</HI> in who&s;e Pha&s;es great Alterations have been ob&s;er|ved
by &s;everal; and Mon&s;. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> judges &s;ome of&punc; tho&s;e Appearances to be cau|&s;ed
by &s;ome kind of Waters. The like I conceive may be &s;aid for the Body of
<HI>Saturn,</HI> though our Tele&s;cpes have not yet certainly di&s;tingui&s;b'd <HI>P$aenomena</HI>
&s;ufficient to prove its Rotation.</P>
<P>I &s;ay moreover, that this Power is not only placed in the Earth, but that there
is the like Power in every Globular Body in the Univer&s;e, whether Sun or Fixed
Star, Planet primary or &s;econdary, and in the Cometical Body included, as I
have &s;uppo&s;ed, within the <HI>Nucleus</HI> or white Cloud appearing in the Head.</P>
<P>In the third place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Its Power acts indefinite|ly upwards.</NOTE> I &s;ay, that this Power of Gravity, which is &s;ufficiently
evident on the Superficies of the Earth, and acts &s;o regularly every where round
the Surface of the Globes, is not &s;uddenly extingui&s;hed, nor lo&s;eth its Power at
a little height above us: But, as I conceive, it is extended to a va&s;t di&s;tance up|ward,
even indefinitely; and though it may be &s;aid to be &s;en&s;ibly finite, yet this
&s;en&s;ible Boundary has its Limits prodigiou&s;ly large; and when the Degree of its
Power, which &s;hall be called &s;en&s;ible, is &s;tated, then the&s;e Limits al&s;o or Di&s;tance
of &s;uch an imaginary Surface, may be Geometrically determined, and the Pro|portion
of the Semi Diameter of it to that of the Globe of the Body in the
middle, exactly determined and demon&s;trated. I conceive further, that this
Power thus extended, does act with various Degrees at &s;everal Di&s;tances from
this Body, which Degrees I &s;hall al&s;o endeavour to &s;tate, and, as I conceive,
evidently&punc; demon&s;trate from my Hypothe&s;is, founded, as I conceive, upon the
<HI>Phaeomena</HI> of Nature, and not taken up at random, or by chance. The&s;e my
Conceptions (as being, I think, wholly knew, and not yet a&s;&s;erted by any Per|&s;on
what&s;oever) may &s;eem &s;trange and extravagant, and I mu&s;t be content to
have them &s;o e&s;teemed, by &s;uch as may either have a Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for &s;ome o|ther
Hypothe&s;is, or &s;hall not allow of the Arguments I &s;hall bring to confirm
them as &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e. It cannot, I &s;uppo&s;e, be expected that I
&s;hould try or &s;hew Experiments at Di&s;tances &s;ufficient to prove it experimentally
and po&s;itively; and therefore all that I can bring is only this, that I find a cer|tain
Agreement and&punc; Coherence of this my Suppo&s;ition with other Operations in
Nature, and that hereby the Appearances of Nature's working are explain'd:
Whereas I cannot find that by any other Hypothe&s;es that have been hitherto
made known,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Opini|ons concerning the Motions of the Planets.</NOTE> the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Heavens can be intelligibly and clearly &s;ol|ved,
without the granting of many &s;uch Actions or Motions, as are very ab&s;urd,
di&s;&s;onant, and contrary to the natural Motions, Actions and Effects of Powers
and Motions, which are within our reach to examine. Whence &s;ome of them,
that they may give a Cau&s;e of the undoubted Appearances, have been fain to
&s;uppo&s;e under&s;tanding Beings, Spirits or Intelligences, to be the Movents or
Cau&s;es of &s;uch Extravagancies. Others have &s;uppo&s;ed various &s;orts of &s;olid
Orbs, Orbits, Epicycles, and I know not what other Wheel-work, to make out
the &s;en&s;ible Inequalities, and yet regular Periods; which being too gro&s;s,
<PB N="179" REF="217">
and contradicted by the Motion of Comets, others have rejected, but
in&s;tead thereof, have &s;uppo&s;ed Magneti&s;m, as <HI>Kepler</HI> and his Followers,
who have to that end feigned a Friendly Side and an Enemy Side to be
planted in the circumgyrating Cele&s;tial Bodies: And becau&s;e the Moon al|ways
keeps the &s;ame Side very near, re&s;pecting the Earth, and &s;o its Appearances
contradicted this Suppo&s;ition; therefore they &s;uppo&s;ed&punc; a <HI>Nucleus</HI> within the
Moon, which had a differing Motion and Po&s;ition in re&s;pect of the Parts of the
Shell, or outward &s;uperficial Parts of the Moon which appeared. To help this
yet farther, for this was not enough to do the bu&s;ine&s;s, they &s;uppo&s;ed a radiating
Species to &s;tand always &s;tiff, like the Spokes in the Nave of the Wheel, and to
turn round as the Body placed in the middle is turned; which radiating Species
or Spokes, like a kind of Be&s;om, &s;weep along the Planet with them, not &s;o fa&s;t
as they them&s;elves are moved, but with a &s;omewhat $lower Pace$ and that &s;o
much the $lower, as the Body to be &s;weeped forward was farther di&s;tant. But
be&s;ide this, another Actor is needed, and that is, a &s;econd &s;ort of Spokes made
of the Rays of Light; the&s;e al&s;o are &s;uppo&s;ed&punc; to help to &s;weep it on. Na$,
be&s;ides all the&s;e there is another Help wanting, and that is, Magneti&s;m, like
that of the Dipping Needle; by which means there is feigned al&s;o to be a kind
of Libration, &s;ometimes of the Body, fometimes of the Orbit. And after all
the&s;e and &s;everal other $ame Helps &s;uppo&s;ed, we find they are fain to be mo&s;t
thrown a&s;ide, when they come to Calculation. Others, as <HI>DesCartes</HI> and his Fol|lowers,
have &s;uppo&s;ed a Whirling of the <HI>Aether</HI> round each Star, or Planetary&punc;
Body, and a &s;wimming of the Planet that moves round it in this <HI>Vortice.</HI> But
how uncertain Effects and Motions of the Planetary Bodies&punc; mu&s;t this way be
produced, any one that con&s;iders well the Hypothe&s;is, will quickly find, and as
readily conclude, that if this Hypothe&s;is be true, there can be no
A&s;tronomy; be&s;ides, that were it granted, the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> them&s;elves could not be &s;olved.
It may &s;till be &s;aid, that the di&s;proving of all the&s;e will &s;till be no Argument
why what I have here &s;uppo&s;ed &s;hould be true.</P>
<P>But then it may likewi&s;e be farther urged, i&s;t, That this Hypothe&s;is or A&s;&s;er|tion
which I have laid down, doth not create or &s;uppo&s;e any new or unheard of
Powers or Motions, but &s;uppo&s;es only &s;uch as are altogether uniform and &s;imi|lar
to Powers, Operations, Effects or Motions, which are within our reach and
command, which we daily try, &s;ee, and find the regular working of.</P>
<P>My Arguments therefore to prove this Suppo&s;ition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments to prove the Sup|po&s;ition</NOTE> are only the&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That What I here &s;uppo&s;e in all Bodies, I can prove to be in &s;ome, and
&s;o &s;uppo&s;e nothing ab&s;urd or impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the Principles I ground it upon, are (according to the
working of Nature in all things) the mo&s;t &s;imple and the &s;horte&s;t that can be:
And 'tis generally a&s;&s;erted &s;o to be by all Philo&s;ophers, and found by all inqui|&s;itive
Searchers into Nature. <HI>Natura ni$il agit fru&s;tra, &s;ed fru&s;tra fit per plura&punc;
quod fieri pote&s;t per pauciora.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, That Nature &s;eems to take &s;imilar Ways for producing &s;imilar Effects;
without granting of which we cannot rea&s;on or make any Conclu&s;ion from &s;imi|lar
Operations. And then it would be no Ab&s;urdity to &s;ay, a Man grew out of
the Earth like a Plant, or a Plant had Under&s;tanding and &s;poke.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That more or le&s;s of the&s;e Principles is to be found in every Body
in Nature, but more remarkable in &s;ome of the Bodies in which I here &s;uppo&s;e
it, and that there is nothing that I have met with that does &s;eem to &s;hew a con|trary
or contradicting Quality in any one of them.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That from the&s;e mo&s;t &s;ingle and ea&s;y Principles of Body and Moti|ons
here a&s;&s;erted, there will follow &s;uch a Regulated Motion, as will <HI>a priori</HI>
&s;hew what are, have been, or &s;hall be at any time a&s;&s;igned the true Places and
Motions of the Cele&s;tial Bodies, con&s;onant to the Appearances them&s;elves:
And this not in one, but in all, as I hope I &s;hall &s;hortly make more evident.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="218">
Fir&s;t then, that what I here &s;uppo&s;e to be in all Cele&s;tial Globular Bodies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That Planetary Bodies have a Gravitation to them.</NOTE> I
can demon&s;trate to be in &s;ome; I think will readily enough be granted, when I
prove that the Earth, on which we live, is one of tho&s;e Cele&s;tial Bodies: And
that Part I think I have proved by the Ob&s;ervation which I made of the Parallax
of the Orb of the Earth to the bright Star in the Dragon's, Head, which pa&s;&s;es
very near the <HI>Zenith</HI> of <HI>London;</HI> an Account of which I have already given in
my Attempt to prove the Motion of the Earth, which Attempt (how <HI>trivial</HI>
&s;oever it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, yet considering, that without, &s;ome &s;uch Proof we
were condemned to the wor&s;t Place in the Univer&s;e, and &s;o thought unfit and un|able
to under&s;tand any thing of Cele&s;tial Bodies) has given Mankind, one Argu|ment
at lea&s;t to believe &s;omewhat better of their Mother Earth and them&s;elves, than
they did before, viz. That &s;he hath <HI>Origo Caele&s;tis,</HI> and that we our &s;elves are <HI>Incolae
Caelestes.</HI> And &s;o being granted able, at lea&s;t, to con&s;ider, examine and rea&s;on
about the Nature of the Earth on which we live, we are at the &s;ame time grant|ed
to be able to con&s;ider, examine and under&s;tand the Nature of &s;ome Cele&s;tial
Body. This being granted, all the <HI>Ptolemaick</HI> &s;olid Orbs immediately vani&s;h, and
all the ingenious Clockwork which has &s;ince that time been added to his. For
&s;ince we are a&s;&s;ured by this Ob&s;ervation, that the Body of the Earth is moved
round the Sun once in a Year, and that the Earth &s;wims or is incompa&s;&s;ed with a
fluid Air only, or a more fluid <HI>Aether,</HI> and that the other Planetary Bodies are
moved about the Sun in the $ame manner as the Earth, and have the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;i|ons
and Affections as the Earth hath of acceding towards and receding from wards
the Sun, of moving &s;wifter and $lower, according to &s;everal Di&s;tances from that
Body, of turning round upon their <HI>Axes,</HI> of carrying peculiar le&s;&s;er Planets along
with them, which move about them as the Moon doth about the Earth, of
eclip&s;ing and being eclip&s;ed by tho&s;e Bodies, of being inlightned by the Beams
of the Sun, and of being dark where that Light cannot &s;hine, and the like;
why &s;hould we any more &s;uppo&s;e it nece&s;&s;ary that the other Planets &s;hould have
&s;olid Orbs to guide their Motions, than we find the Earth it &s;elf, which is one
of them, really hath? not now to urge the Arguments drawn from the Motions
of Comets. This <HI>trivial</HI> Ob&s;ervation then was nece&s;&s;ary to introduce us into the
<HI>Expansum</HI> of Heaven, and to manife&s;t to us how great a Voyage we make in a
Year, and what we al&s;o do in the &s;pace of twenty four hours, and to inform us
what Opportunity we have of &s;urveying and knowing more of the World than
before we thought our &s;elves capable of. And though the Notion was perhaps
fully under&s;tood and believed long before the other of <HI>Ptolemy</HI> was broacht;
yet being only a Probability, there could be no po&s;itive and undoubting A&s;&s;ent
given unto it, without &s;ome &s;uch Experiment or Ob&s;ervation as I have formerly
produced. The Earth then being found to be a Planetary Body, it will be no
difficult matter to prove, that it hath that Propriety which we call Gravity;
that is, that all Terre&s;trial Bodies, or &s;uch Bodies that &s;eem to be part of it,
or that are of a like nature with it, are continually moved, or have an Endea|vour
to move towards the Center of the whole, which Endeavour is called the
Gravity of &s;uch Bodies: And con&s;equently a Planetary Body is proved to have Gravity, and 'twill not be difficult to prove the &s;ame in all the other.</P>
<P>It remains only to enquire what is the Cause or Principle of this Gravity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Inquiry into the Cau&s;e of Gravity. Some of its Proprieties enumerated.</NOTE>
and what invi&s;ible or in&s;en&s;ible Power it is that cau&s;es this Endeavour. Various have
been the Attempts of &s;everal to explain it, but no one, that I have yet met with, to
me &s;eems &s;atisfactory; nor would they make out the <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> tho' all they
have &s;uppo&s;ed, how extravagant &s;oever they be, &s;hould be granted; whatever
the Power be that doth thus cau&s;e Bodies to move towards the Center.</P>
<P>1&s;t, It is wholly in&s;en&s;ible by any other Means than by the Effects. There are
no $amous Particles underneath to be di&s;cover'd to pull down the Body, nor any
hammer Particles above to beat it down. A Body is not le&s;s heavy though there
be never &s;o thick, nor never &s;o den&s;e a Body placed between that and the Earth
to break the Chains, or above it to hinder the Strokes of the Hammers or &s;trik|ing
Particles; nay though included every way within the den&s;e&s;t Body; as the
middle Parts of a great Stone, or Piece of Mettal, weigh as much when whole,
as when the &s;ame is broken in pieces.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="219">
<HI>2dly,</HI> The Endeavour of Gravity acts or tends always towards the Center of
the Globe of the Earth, as far as any Ob&s;ervation has been made. This is ge|nerally
granted and believed by all, though I doubt whether it hath been ever
proved; for though I believe it nearly probable to be &s;o, yet I am not a&s;&s;ured of
it by any Experiment yet &s;o much as attempted to be made. The be&s;t way that
I know how to prove it, is, to mea&s;ure the parts of a Meridian upon the Earth
from Pole to Pole, and compare them with Cele&s;tial Meridional Altitudes:
For if they every where corre&s;pond and an&s;wer one another, then the Perpen|dicular
Line is true in all tho&s;e Places; but if otherwise, not. And till this
be done, we are not by any certain Experiment a&s;&s;ured, that the Body of the
Earth it &s;elf is perfectly Globular; for it may be &s;omewhat either of an Egg-form,
the longe&s;t Diameter being in the <HI>Axis,</HI> or el&s;e of a Turnep-form, the
longe&s;t Diameter being in the Equinoctial. Nor is the Shadow of the Earth
eclip&s;ing the Moon, &s;ufficiently di&s;tinct to determine this Point. This Gravi|tating
therefore to a Central Point, though it be probable, is not yet po&s;i|tively
proved by any Ob&s;ervations hitherto made, nor is it very ea&s;y to be made
to &s;ufficient exactne&s;s. But though we have no Experiment here made on the
Earth, that does po&s;itively evince it; yet this fetcht from the other Planets, may
do &s;omething towards it: Namely, that mo&s;t of the re&s;t of the Planets (&s;ome
of which are certainly bigger than the Earth it &s;elf, and, as I but now men|tioned,
have the &s;ame Qualifications) are ob&s;erved to be very near Globular.
Here by the by, I cannot but take notice, that there are in Philo&s;ophy many
things that are generally taken for granted which yet when we &s;eek for the
grounds of tho&s;e Opinions, none certain are to be found, and thence all that is
built upon them mu&s;t be uncertain. For in&s;tance, in Experiments that have
been made to prove the Magnitude of a Degree, 'twill be in&s;ufficient to prove
the Magnitude of the Earth, till by comparing &s;everal made in &s;everal Lati|tudes,
they are all found to agree, and &s;hew the &s;ame Quantity: For if the
Earth be Oval, as there &s;eems to be good rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, then the Length of
a Degree in one Latitude will not be equal to the Length of a Degree in another
Latitude, and the Perpendicular of Gravity will not always point to the Center
of the Earth. For if the Principle or primary Cau&s;e of Gravity, which I
conceive an internal Motion in the Earth, be every way uniform, and &s;o cau&s;e
an equal Attraction to the Center, then any other Cau&s;e that alters the Di&s;po|tions
of Bodies to receive this Power, or that superinduces another Power that
in &s;ome parts of the Earth has a greater Renitency again&s;t the Power of Gravi|ty
than it hath in other Parts; then the uniform Effect which Gravity alone
would operate, will be altered by the adventitious Power. Now the Diurnal
Rotation of the Earth doth &s;uperinduce &s;uch a Power; for the Parts near the
Equinoctial mu&s;t have an Endeavour outwards, or from the Center; whereas
the Parts nearer the Poles mu&s;t have le&s;s, and &s;o much the le&s;s, by how much
the nearer they approach the Poles: And this Renitency, as it will be directly
oppo&s;ite to Gravity under the Equinoctial, &s;o will it be in all other Parts ob|lique
unto it. Wherefore from the con&s;ideration of the&s;e two Cau&s;es, there
&s;eems to be a probability that the Perpendicular does not always and every where
point to the Central Point of the Earth, how generally &s;oever that Opinion be
received which a&s;&s;erts the contrary; and may po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve &s;ome further En|quiry,
as opportunity &s;hall offer; and there mu&s;t want a Demon&s;tration till this
Que&s;tion be determined. And by the way 'tis very remarkable, that by compa|ring
of former with later Ob&s;ervations of the Magnitude of a Degree, the
Earth &s;eems to have continually grown le&s;s. But of the&s;e and &s;everal other
Remarks I &s;hall &s;peak more, when I come to read concerning the Earth it &s;elf:
I &s;hall therefore return to the con&s;ideration of Gravity in general. This be|lieved
Roundne&s;s of the Figure, &s;hews Gravity to act regularly in every part of
the Earth's Superficies, otherwife it could not be nearly round.</P>
<P>In the 3d place then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3dly, This Gravitation and Levitation extends to and beyond the Earth.</NOTE> the tendency of Grave Bodies re&s;pects the middle Parts
of the Earth, though the&s;e Central Parts be carried with a very &s;wift Motion
from We&s;t to Ea&s;t by an annual Motion about the Sun. And therefore 'tis pro|bable
that it carrys with it the Principle or Power that acts; and thence, that it
<PB N="182" REF="220">
mu&s;t there be &s;ought for. This will need no other Proof, its Motion being al|ready
proved by the Perpendicular Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>4<HI>thly,</HI> Gravity is a Power which at all times acts equally; that is, a Body
which remains the &s;ame, will always be found to have the &s;ame weight. This
I conceive, none will doubt, but yet 'tis not very ea&s;y po&s;itively to prove it; for
Scales cannot examine it, becau&s;e if the gravitating Power alter, the Counter|poi&s;e
will be affected as well as the Weight; nor can it be try'd with my Phi|lo&s;ophical Scales made by a Spring, becau&s;e it may be &s;aid, the Alteration is in
the Spring, and not in the Weight. The only way that I conceive it may be
try'd, is by the De&s;cent of Bodies, compar'd with the time of their de&s;cending
a certain Space, or becau&s;e that will be very nice, by the Vibrations of a Pen|dulum,
who&s;e time and number of Vibrations may be &s;tinted: But here al&s;o
will come &s;ome Objections, that there may be other Cau&s;es of altering the Ve|locity
of the Vibrations, be&s;ides Gravity, as the &s;hrinking and &s;tretching of the
Rod; the thickning or thinning of the Air or Medium in which the Pendulum
moves, unle&s;s it be in <HI>Vacuo,</HI> and the like. Yet I conceive the&s;e and others may
be obviated, and the Matter determined, if that were necessary; but another
Argument hereafter to be mentioned of the Moon, will better clear it.</P>
<P>5<HI>thly,</HI> Gravity is ob&s;erved to accelerate the Velocity of de&s;cending Bodies
with equal Accelerations in equal times. This hath been &s;ufficiently proved by
falling Bodies and Pendulums, to certain Degrees pretty near, but not exactly.
And therefore in the</P>
<P><HI>6th</HI> place, Gravity is a finite Power, and acts with a determinate Degree of
Force; that is, the Gravitating Power can never accelerate any Body beyond its
own Velocity. That it is finite, we ea&s;ily find from the Power we have of
throwing or &s;hooting Bodies upwards, which could not be, did not the Power
of the Arm, Bow or Gun exceed it: And comparative to other Powers of Na|ture, 'tis weak.</P>
<P><HI>7thly,</HI> That it acts on all Bodies promi&s;cuou&s;ly, whether fluid or &s;olid: So
that the &s;ame Body which can be made fluid or &s;olid, provided nothing be added
to it or taken from it, will have, in both Forms, the &s;ame weight <HI>quam proxime.</HI></P>
<P>8<HI>thly,</HI> The Bodies mo&s;t receptive of it are &s;uch as have their Particles of the
greate&s;t bulk and of the clo&s;e&s;t Texture. This the whole Series of grave Bodies
will &s;ufficiently manife&s;t: and I &s;hall afterwards prove, when I come to &s;hew
the Texture of Body, what it is that cau&s;es Bodies to be grave or heavy, and
what makes them light, and that 'tis not the quantity of Matter contained with|in
the &s;ame Space, but the Modification of that Matter, and the Receptivity it
hath of Uniform Power.</P>
<P><HI>9thly,</HI> I cannot find by any certain Experiment, that grave Bodies do &s;en&s;ibly
decrea&s;e in Gravity, tho' further removed from the Surface of the Earth; which
was the Intent of an Experiment I formerly tryed at the top of the Steeple of St.
<HI>Paul</HI>'s and at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abby,</HI> and may now again be repeated with much more
conveniency and greater advantage at the Column on <HI>Fi&s;h&s;treet-Hill.</HI> For by counter|poi&s;ing
two Weights in a curious Pair of Scales, fir&s;t at the top of the Steeple, and
then letting down one of the Weights by a Wire of two hundred and four Foot in
length, the Counterpoi&s;e remaining at the top in the Scale, the <HI>Aequipondium</HI>
remained; whereas if the Gravity of the Body had increa&s;ed by Approximation
to the Earth, the Weight let down to the bottom mu&s;t have weighed the heavier.
But though the Difference were in&s;en&s;ible in &s;o &s;mall an height, yet I am apt to
think &s;ome Difference may be di&s;covered in greater heights, and by &s;ome more
curious ways than tho&s;e I then u&s;ed, even in that height: For I &s;hall in my
following Di&s;cour&s;es plainly &s;hew, from the Theory thereof, that there is ne|ce&s;&s;arily
a Difference, and that the Power of Gravity does decrea&s;e at farther
and farther Di&s;tance from the Center of the Earth, and con&s;equently that the
Line of a projected de&s;cending Body is not truly Parabolical, but Elliptical,
<PB N="183" REF="221">
though it &s;houtd be made <HI>in vacuo,</HI> where the Impediment of the <HI>Medium</HI> could
make very little or no Alteration.</P>
<P>Having enumerated &s;ome of the mo&s;t remarkable Proprieties of Gravity, we
come in the next place to con&s;ider what may be the Cau&s;e thereof.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, I believe I &s;hall not need to &s;ay much again&s;t the Opinion of <HI>Intel|ligent
Matter,</HI> which &s;uppo&s;es every part of Matter to act under&s;tandingly; for
that being &s;uppo&s;ed, all Philo&s;ophy is vain, and there needs no farther Inquiry
into Nature.</P>
<P>And &s;econdly, I have as little to &s;ay to its Cou&s;in-german Opinion, <HI>viz:</HI> the
<HI>Regimen</HI> of an <HI>Hylarchick Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>And 3ly, The <HI>Epicurean</HI> Atoms &s;eem to me to give as little of Explanation
almo&s;t as either of the former.</P>
<P>And 4ly, For the <HI>Peripatetick</HI> Doctrine of tendency to the Center of the Uni|ver&s;e,
be&s;ides that the Foundation is fal&s;e, the Earth being proved not to be in
the Center, 'tis not yet under&s;tood what the tendency is.</P>
<P>5ly, The <HI>Carte&s;ian</HI> Doctrine, and that of Mr. <HI>Hobbs,</HI> are both in&s;ufficient,
becau&s;e they do not give any rea&s;on why Bodies &s;hould de&s;cend towards the
Center under or near the Poles.</P>
<P>6ly, Nor will the <HI>Magneti&s;m</HI> of <HI>Gilbert</HI> or <HI>Kepler</HI> &s;erve; for, as I &s;hall af|terwards
&s;hew, that is a Propriety di&s;tinct from Gravity, and of quite another
nature.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t therefore be &s;omewhat el&s;e differing from all the&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the Cau&s;e of Gravity is.</NOTE> which by rea&s;on
of its acting by the means of &s;ome very in&s;en&s;ible Body, it will be very hard to
demon&s;trate, yet not altogether impo&s;&s;ible. We find then that a Propriety &s;ome|what
like this is to be found in the Attraction of the Magnet and Iron. Ano|ther
&s;omewhat like it is to be found in Amber, Jet, Gla&s;s, Chry&s;tal, Diamonds,
and &s;everal hard Bodies upon Rubbing: And more in&s;tructive yet to this Inqui|ry
is the Experiment of Mr. <HI>Newton,</HI> of rubbing a Plate of Gla&s;s, which is
laid over &s;ome &s;mall bits of Paper, or other light Bodies, at &s;ome di&s;tance, by
which Rubbing the Papers are made to ri&s;e up towards the Gla&s;s, and &s;tick fa&s;t
to it. Now in all the&s;e Experiments there is a &s;en&s;ible Attraction of Grave
Bodies to the re&s;pective attracting Bodies, or at lea&s;t a Motion of tho&s;e Bodies
towards one another; though in all, the <HI>Medium,</HI> that cau&s;es this Endeavour of
Motion, be in&s;en&s;ible. Some have &s;uppo&s;ed for Amber, that the &s;ame being a
very unctuous Body, certain &s;tringy unctuous <HI>Effluvia</HI> are &s;ent out, which &s;tick|ing
to the light Bodies, are drawn into the Amber again, and &s;o bring back with
them the light Bodies. But this is very hard to be &s;uppo&s;ed of Gla&s;s or Chry|&s;tal,
and lea&s;t of all of a Diamond, which yet will have a con&s;iderable Electri|city,
as 'tis called, upon Rubbing; Be&s;ides, 'tis evident by Mr. <HI>Newton's</HI> Expe|riment,
that the greate&s;t Electricity of Gla&s;s is at the very time when it is hard|e&s;t
rubbed, which &s;hould be the time when the&s;e unctuous Strings &s;hould be
&s;ent out; 'tis nece&s;&s;ary therefore that &s;ome other Medium mu&s;t be found than
the&s;e unctuous and &s;tringy Emanations.</P>
<P>If we farther con&s;ider of the&s;e Experiments, we &s;hall find that there is in all
the&s;e a nece&s;&s;ity of an internal vibrative Motion of the Parts of the Electrick
Bodies; and that &s;o &s;oon as ever that Motion cea&s;es, the Electricity al&s;o cea&s;es:
We may therefore conclude, that there may be &s;uch an internal Motion of the
Parts of &s;ome Bodies, as may cau&s;e an Electrical Virtue in them, whereby they
will be able to draw, with &s;ome &s;mall Degree of Power, &s;ome Bodies to them.</P>
<P>I have already here produced &s;everal Experiments, whereby I have &s;hewn how
mechanically to produce &s;uch an Attraction towards the acting Body. The fir&s;t
was that of a Body placed upon a wooden Rod, the one End of which was kept
in its place by a Spring, and the other was &s;truck by a Hammer, whereby it
plainly appeared, that at every Stroke the Body was moved on the Rod towards
the Hammer that &s;truck. Here the <HI>Aether</HI> was re&s;embled to a Solid. By the
&s;econd Experiment, where a Ball poi&s;ed in Water de&s;cended toward the &s;triking
Part, I &s;hewed how the &s;ame Effect might be done by a fluid Medium, as in
the other was done by a Solid. In the third was &s;hewn how a Fluid al&s;o might
<PB N="184" REF="222">
be affected by a like Pul&s;e;<NOTE PLACE="marg">See more Expe|riments in the Author's Life.</NOTE> for that the Water it &s;elf, by means of a vibra|tive
Motion in the Parts of the Gla&s;s, acquired a Motion towards the vibrating
Parts. I &s;hould have proceeded, if not interrupted, to have experimentally
proved the Effect of this Power in <HI>Media</HI> much more in&s;en&s;ible. The Obviou&s;|ne&s;s
po&s;&s;ibly of the&s;e and &s;uch like Experiments may make them be looked up|on
as &s;light and trivial; and the Paucity of them, for that they come not in by
whole Shoals, but are only caught, &s;ingly, may make them not regarded. But
as the Miracle was not le&s;s of the &s;ingle Fi&s;h catched&punc; by a Hook, with the
Tribute in has Mouth, than of the Shoals which were ready to &s;ink the Ve&s;&s;els,
and brake the Nets: So &s;ome one plain but pertinent Experiment, apply'd with
Judgment, may be more &s;ignificant than thou&s;ands of &s;uch as are pompous, amu|&s;ing,
and excite-Admiration. And I am &s;ati&s;fied that more Di&s;coveries in Nature
may be made by the mo&s;t plain, obvious and trivial Experiments to be every|where
met with, than by the far-fetcht and dear bought Experiments which &s;ome
&s;eek after.</P>
<P>Nor is this way of working at a di&s;tance, by means of the internal Mo|tion
of the Particles of the Body; &s;o &s;trange a thing in Nature, that we need
much to in&s;i&s;t upon the&s;e few Experiments to prove it. For if we con&s;ider the
<HI>Totum Sen&s;ibile</HI> in Nature, we &s;hall find it to be little el&s;e than what is this way
produced. I have already, I think, fully proved in Light and Colour, the
Object of Sight, that the Motion which is produced in the Eye, proceeds from
an internal Motion made in the Sun &s;o many thou&s;ands of Miles di&s;tant, or from
the &s;ame in &s;ome Stars &s;o many thou&s;and times as much farther off. I could al&s;o
as ea&s;ily prove, that Sound in the Ear, which is a real Motion in &s;ome part thereof,
is produced by the internal Motion of the Parts of the Bell &s;ome Miles perhaps
di&s;tant. Somewhat like to this may al&s;o be &s;aid of the Smell, and the other
Sen&s;es; but the In&s;tances of the fir&s;t two will be &s;ufficient; e&s;pecially the latter
is the mo&s;t evident; and that becau&s;e both the Motion in the Bell, and the Mo|tion
in the Ear, or &s;ome other Body there placed, is di&s;covered by the other sen|&s;es,
namely, by the Sight and Touch, as well as by the Ear.</P>
<P>The&s;e Particulars I could more largely explain by particular Experiments, and
plainly evince, that the Motions of &s;everal Bodies at a di&s;tance, are cau&s;ed by
the internal Motion of the &s;ounding Body; and that this Power of moving is
every way propagated by the ambient <HI>Medium,</HI> which excites in &s;olid Bodies at a
di&s;tance, a &s;imilar Motion. I could farther al&s;o prove, that every one of the&s;e
di&s;tinct internal Motions of Bodies, as that of Light, and that of Sound, have
di&s;tinct and differing <HI>Mediums,</HI> by which tho&s;e Motions are communicated from
the affecting to the affected Body: And &s;o I conceive al&s;o that the <HI>Medium</HI> of
Gravity may be di&s;tinct and differing both from that of Light, and from that of
Sound. I conceive then, that the Gravity of the Earth may be cau&s;ed by &s;ome
internal Motion of the internal or central Parts of the Earth; which internal
and central Motion may be cau&s;ed, generated and maintained by the Motion of
the external and all the intermediate Parts of its Body: So that the whole Globe
of the Earth may contribute to this Motion, as it will happen to a Globe of
Gla&s;s or &s;olid Mettal, to any part of which no internal Motion can be commu|nicated,
without at the &s;ame time affecting the whole with the &s;ame Motion.
And I &s;hall mo&s;t plainly and evidently prove, when I come to the Explication of
Magneti&s;m, that this is undeniably performed and effected by this means.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e then that there is in the Ball of the Earth &s;uch a Motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hypothe&s;is of the Cau&s;e of Gravity.</NOTE> as I, for di&s;tin|ction
&s;ake, will call a <HI>Globular Motion,</HI> whereby all the Parts thereof have a Vi|bration
towards and fromwards the Center, or of Expan&s;ion and Contraction; and
that this vibrative Motion is very &s;hort and very quick, at it is in all very hard and
very compact Bodies: That this vibrative Motion does communicate or produce a
Motion in a certain Part of the <HI>Aether,</HI> which is inter&s;per&s;ed between the&s;e &s;olid
vibrating Parts; which communicated Motion does cau&s;e this inter&s;per&s;ed Fluid to
vibrate every way in <HI>Orbem,</HI> from and towards the Center, in Lines radiating from
the &s;ame. By which radiating Vibration of this exceeding Fluid, and yet exceed|ing
den&s;e Matter, not only all the Parts of the Earth are carried or forced down
towards the Center; but the Motion being continued into the <HI>Aether,</HI> inter&s;per&s;ed
between the Air and other kinds of Fluids, it cau&s;eth tho&s;e al&s;o to have a tendency
towards the Center; and much more any &s;en&s;ible Body what&s;oever, that is any
<PB N="185" REF="223">
where placed in the Air, or above it, though at a va&s;t Di&s;tance; which Di&s;tance
I &s;hall afterwards determine, and &s;hew with what proportioned Power it acts up|on
Bodies at all Di&s;ances both without and within the Earth: For this Power pro|pagated,
as I &s;hall then &s;hew, does continually dimini&s;h according as the Orb of Pro|pagation
does continually increa&s;e, as we find the Propagations of the <HI>Media</HI> of
Light and Sound al&s;o to do; as al&s;o the Propagatian of Undulation upon the Su|perficies
of Water. And from hence I conceive the Power thereof to be always
reciprocal to the <HI>Area</HI> or Superficies of the Orb of Propagation, that is duplicate of
the Di&s;tance; as will plainly follow and appear from the con&s;ideration of the Na|ture
thereof, and will hereafter be more plainly evinced by the Effects it cau&s;e&s;
at &s;uch &s;everal Di&s;tanccs.</P>
<P>This propagated Pul&s;e I take to be the Cau&s;e of the De&s;cent of Bodies towards
the Earth. But it way perhaps &s;eem a little &s;trange how the Propagation of a
Motion outward &s;hould be the cau&s;e of the Motion of heavy Bodies down|wards.
To make this the more intelligible, I &s;hall mention an Ob&s;ervation very
commonly known among&s;t Trade&s;men; and that is, the driving of a Hammer
or Axe upon the Helve, which to do the ea&s;ie&s;t way, they commonly &s;trike the
End of the Helve, holding the Helve in their Hand, and the Axe or Hammer at
the lower End hanging downward, by which means they not only make the Axe
to go on upon the Helve, but make it a&s;cend, if they continue &s;triking, even
to their very Hand. To apply which Ob&s;ervation to my pre&s;ent Theory, I &s;ay,
that the <HI>Medium</HI> of Propagation is the Helve, and the Axe or Hammer is the
grave Body that descends: So that at every Stroke that is given by the Globe of
the Earth to the propagating <HI>Medium,</HI> one Degree of Velocity of Descent is given
to the Grave Body, which is as it were the Axe. Now according to the Velocity
of this vibrative Motion of the Earth, &s;o mu&s;t the Power it communicates be
&s;tronger or weaker. Suppo&s;e for in&s;tance, there &s;hould be 1000 of the&s;e Pul&s;es
in a Second of Time; then mu&s;t the Grave Body receive all tho&s;e thou&s;and Im|pre&s;&s;ions
within the &s;pace of that Second, and a thou&s;and more the next, and a|nother
thou&s;and the third Second; &s;o that in equal Times it would receive equal
Degrees of Acceleration. And if a Second of Time were again &s;ubdivided into
a thou&s;and Moments of Time, the Body would receive one Degree of Accele|ration
in the fir&s;t moment, one more in the 2d, a 3d in a 3d, and &s;o onwards:
So that the compounded Acceleration would be as one the fir&s;t Second, three the
next Second, and five the next, and &s;o onwards; according as it is ob&s;erved in
the Motion of de&s;cending Bodies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Medium</HI> that propagates this Motion, I &s;uppo&s;e to be one part of that which
permeates mo&s;t Bodies, which we call by the general Name of <HI>Aether,</HI> and thence it
proceeds that the Motion is communicated to every part thereof: And &s;o the <HI>Mo|mentum</HI>
of every Body becomes proportioned to its Bulk or Den&s;ity of Parts, difform
to the fluid <HI>Medium</HI> that communicates the Pul&s;e.</P>
<P>The Objections that I expect again&s;t this Hypothe&s;is may be &s;ome &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P>1&s;t. How does it appear there is any &s;uch Motion in the internal Parts of the
Body of the Earth? For who can de&s;cend thither, and if they could, how &s;hould
they find it, it being from the Hypothe&s;is &s;uppo&s;ed not within the reach of Sen&s;e?</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer, that though this be hypothetical, yet that there is &s;ome &s;uch
Motion in tho&s;e Parts, I &s;hall prove clear enough, when I come to the Expli|cation
of Magneti&s;m. In the mean time, there is nothing ab&s;urd or contradictory
to the re&s;t of Nature. The &s;olide&s;t Body in the World can receive an internal
Motion of its Particles from an outward Impre&s;&s;ion; as has been found in Dia|monds,
which upon Rubbing would &s;hine, and upon &s;o rubbing would become
Electrical, and attract Bodies to them; as I ob&s;erved in the Diamond which
was formerly &s;hewed this Society by Mr. <HI>Hen&s;haw.</HI> Be&s;ides, that it is receptive
of internal Motion, is farther evident by the &s;plitting or cleaving of a Diamond
by a &s;mart Stroke; which is well enough known to our Jewellers and Lapida|ries.
The harde&s;t Chry&s;tal, Porphyrys, Agates, Flints, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that I have yet met
with, will receive an internal Motion, as may be plainly argued from the Tone
they give upon being briskly &s;truck. The harde&s;t of Mettals always give the
be&s;t and longe&s;t Sounds, and con&s;equently are the le&s;s hindred by the ambient
<HI>Medium. The Author breaks off here abruptly.</HI></P>

The following DISOVVRSE is a Lecture of Light, which I found
among the Authors Manu&s;cripts: and tho' I found by another Paper that it
was read before the foregoing Lecures of Light; yet I judged it would not

appear, that the Picture of the Sun tran&s;mitted through a &s;mall Hole into

<P>THERE is no means in the World for the attaining the true Knowledge of
things more certain and more in&s;tructive,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Experiments the be&s;t way to find out Truths.</NOTE> than the accurate Ob&s;ervation and
&s;trict Examination of them by Trials and Experiments. And thought, I confe&s;s,
it is a much &s;peedier and more ea&s;y way to collect and under&s;tand what is al|ready
known, to read and &s;tudy &s;uch Notions of them as are already deliver'd in
Authors treating of that Subject; yet, as 'tis that way quickly attainable, &s;o
you will as quickly find your &s;elf at a <HI>non plus ultra</HI> in your Information, and
much full$r of Doubts and Queries as to a perfect Knowledge of the thing
you &s;eek, than po&s;&s;ibly you were, when you fir&s;t enter'd upon that Inquiry.
For the more you are informed, the more able you are to inquire for and &s;eek
after what is con&s;iderable to be farther known concerning that Subject; and that
Knowledge is much more apt to &s;lip out of the Memory, and be forgotten:
Whereas that Knowledge which is attained by a Man's own Ob&s;ervation and
Study, as it always remains fixt in his Memory, &s;o it &s;o thoroughly informs his
Imagination with a true and right Idea of the thing he inquires into, that he is
able thereby readily to &s;olve many Doubts and Difficulties that may at fir&s;t oc|cur
to him; and it puts him a capacity of pertinently inquiring farther into
the Nature and Cau&s;e of the thing he &s;eeks after. And let me tell you, who&s;o|ever
has a Knowledge of things made up only of what he finds in Books of that
Subject, &s;hall find it to be very little, confu&s;ed and imperfect; e&s;pecially if
he comes to conver&s;e with &s;uch as have experimentally and &s;agaciou&s;ly enquired
thereinto. And in very many ca&s;es he will not only find his Knowledge little,
confu&s;ed and imperfect, but notoriou&s;ly and dangerou&s;ly fal&s;e and erroneous: So
that this kind of Knowledge, in&s;tead of leading and directing of him in the
right way, oftentimes &s;educes him, and hurries him into the broad Way of
Error and conceited Ignorance. I could give you many In&s;tances of this Truth
in Phy&s;icks, nay even in Mechanicks, who&s;e Principles &s;eem mo&s;t obvious;
and &s;hew you, that for want, I &s;uppo&s;e, of accurate Trials and Experiments,
&s;everal Axioms, which have been received and builded on as Truths, both by all
the antient and modern Philo&s;ophers and Mathematicians, are yet notwith|standing
by &s;ome few Trials and accurate Ob&s;ervations, found notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e:
But the&s;e I &s;hall re&s;erve for &s;ome other Opportunities. I &s;hall now rather chu&s;e
to give you an In&s;tance in another Subject.</P>
<P>I have formerly endeavoured to explain &s;everal things concerning the Nature
and E&s;&s;ence of Light, which I &s;hall not now repeat; but having &s;till many
Doubts in my own Thoughts concerning the &s;ame, I have made it my aim, ac|cording
as I had opportunity, to examine and inquire farther into the Nature
thereof, by &s;uch Ob&s;ervations and Experiments as I judged might be any ways
helpful to the Manife&s;tation thereof. And herein I have not been altogether un|&s;uccc&s;sful,
having di&s;covered &s;everal Proprieties therein, whereof before I had
no Notion or Information.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e prepared a Room fit for Trials of this nature, by &s;o per|fectly
&s;topping all ways by which the Light could find its Entrance into the
&s;ame, that the whole remained perfectly dark; at lea&s;t &s;o much, that though a
<PB N="187" REF="225">
Man &s;taid a long time in the &s;ame, yet the Eye could not perceive any Light.
For though that in many ca&s;es be not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, yet in mo&s;t 'tis gene|rally
very convenient, and fit to make the Trial more accurate and certain. For
as in a Mixture of divers Liquors, 'tis very difficult to distinguish and deter|mine
the true Ta&s;te of any one of them; &s;o the Effects and Properties of any
one Ray is more ob&s;curely perceived, when it is blended and mixed with the
Effects of a thou&s;and others. In this darkened Room I provided &s;uch Conve|niency
for admitting or excluding the Rays of Light, that I could let in what
quantity of Light I plea&s;ed, and in what manner; and thereby had the opportu|nity
of finding &s;everal Proprieties thereof, which are not otherwi&s;e di&s;coverable.
Having then thus darkened a Room, by a very &s;mall Hole through a Bra&s;s Plate
in part of the Shutter, I let through the Light of the Sun, which by degrees
&s;preading it &s;elf, &s;eemed to make up a Cone, who&s;e <HI>Apex</HI> was in the Hole, and
who&s;e Ba&s;e was on the Paper expo&s;ed to receive the &s;ame at a di&s;tance. In this
Image of the Sun thus painted on the Paper, it was very ob&s;ervable that the
Middle thereof was very much brighter than the Edges, and that there was a kind
of dark <HI>Penumbra</HI> that went round about the Limb of the &s;ame, about a 16th
part of the Diameter of the Circle; the which <HI>Penumbra</HI> could be no ways
a&s;cribed either to the le&s;&s;er Light of the Parts of the Sun near the Limb there|of;
or to any thing defective in the make of the Hole or Pa&s;&s;age through which
it was admitted; but to &s;ome other Cau&s;e, or Propriety of Light, which I &s;hall
hereafter explain.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Proper|ty of Light di&s;|covered.</NOTE> Having ob&s;erved this, at about the di&s;tance of two Inches
I let in another Cone of Light, and receiving the Ba&s;es of them upon a Piece of
Paper, at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the Holes, as that the Circles did inter&s;ect each
other; I did manife&s;tly ob&s;erve, that there was not only a <HI>Penumbra</HI> or darker
Ring incompa&s;&s;ing the lighter Circle, but a manife&s;t dark Line or Circle, which
did manife&s;tly appear even where the Limb of the one interfered with the Limb
of the other.</P>
<P>As in the Figure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 2. Fig. 7.</NOTE> where <HI>a b c g h, a d c k l</HI> repre&s;ent the Ba&s;es of tho&s;e Cones
of Light, who&s;e middle Parts <HI>ii ii oo oo,</HI> appear brighter; but the Parts thereof
next the Limb, <HI>e e e e, u u u u,</HI> appear much darker, with a kind of <HI>Penumbra,</HI>
or Faintne&s;s of Light; and the extream Circumference, or terminating Lines of
each, appear perfect dark Strokes; nay though the parts thereof <HI>a b c</HI> and <HI>a d c</HI>
intermix with the brighter Parts of the other Ba&s;e, as at <HI>b</HI> and <HI>d.</HI> Examining
the bigne&s;s of this Ba&s;e with the di&s;tance of it from the <HI>Apex</HI> or Hole, I found
it no ways an&s;wer to that Proportion it ought to have, &s;uppo&s;ing the lateral Rays
from oppo&s;ite Parts of the Limb of the Sun's Disk, did inter&s;ect each other in
the above-mentioned Hole, and did proceed on by &s;trait Lines to the Paper or
Ba&s;e; but according to the various bigne&s;&s;es of the Holes, and according to the
various di&s;tances of the Receiving Papers from tho&s;e Holes, &s;o were the Pro|portions
of the Diameters of tho&s;e Circles to their Di&s;tances varied: Which in
A&s;tronomical Inquiries will produce no &s;mall Errors, if not carefully prevented
by proper Remedies. I proceeded farther to make Experiments concerning the
Nature of Light; and holding an opacous Body between the Hole or <HI>Apex,</HI> and
the Ba&s;e or Paper, I ob&s;erved that there was, notwith&s;tanding all the care I u&s;ed
to exclude other Light than what came in by that &s;ingle Hole, a certain faint
Light ca&s;t even into the Shadow of the Body; and in that part of the lucid part
of the Ba&s;e, which was not &s;haded by the opaque Body, there was a certain
<HI>Fa&s;cia</HI> or Zone of Light which went parallel along with the terminating Line
of the Shadow of the opacous dark Body; the which Zone of Light was
manife&s;tly much lighter than any part of the lucid Ba&s;e be&s;ides. Nay this lucid
Zone did not only cro&s;s the Circle of the Ba&s;e, but did manife&s;tly proceed and
extend it &s;elf a good way beyond the lucid Circle of the Ba&s;e, &s;triking pretty
far into the incompa&s;&s;ing opaque <HI>Medium.</HI> To make this more evident to you
by a Scheme, let O repre&s;ent the Hole in the Shutter of the Window, through
which the Light of the Sun is let pa&s;s:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 2. Fig. $.</NOTE> Let CON repre&s;ent the Cone of Light
tran&s;mitted, and PA the Paper upon which the Circle or Ba&s;is of the Cone is
ca&s;t: Let BB repre&s;ent the opaque Body interpo&s;ed between the Hole and the
Papers, and SS TT the Shadow thereof upon the Paper. That which I ob&s;er|ved
was this: The Shadow of the opaque Body BB was &s;omewhat all over
inlightned, but &s;eem'd mo&s;t inlightned towards the Edge thereof. Several Per|&s;ons
<PB N="188" REF="226">
that were pre&s;ent, and &s;aw and diligently ob&s;erved the&s;e <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> con|ceived
and objected, that the lucid Zone, or brighter part, which edged the
Shadow of the opaque Body, was produced by &s;ome kind of Reflection from
the Side of the &s;aid Body by which the Light pa&s;&s;ed; it being indeed a round
Body, and &s;o &s;ome of the Rays might po&s;&s;ibly reflect, &s;o as to fall upon the lu|cid
Zone: But I could &s;ee no rea&s;on why it &s;hould not as much inlighten any
other part of the bright Ba&s;e or Figure of the Sun on the Paper; for the &s;had|ing
Body being only a round Piece of Wood, not bright and poli&s;ht, nor of &s;o
certain a Reflection, as to direct the Rays that fell on it exactly to a determi|nate
Place, I could not conceive any rea&s;on why that &s;hould produce &s;uch a lu|cid
Zone. Others &s;uppo&s;ed that it might proceed from &s;ome Reflection of the
Bra&s;s Hole through which the Light was admitted into the Room. But to ob|viate
both the&s;e Objections, and to inquire farther into the Nature of this <HI>Phae|nomenon,</HI>
I placed in&s;tead of the Cylinder of Wood, a very &s;harp and &s;mooth
edged Razor, &s;o that the Edge of the Razor was that which ca&s;t the &s;trait Line
of Shadow which divided the lucid Ba&s;e; from which there could be no Re|flection,
at lea&s;t &s;o very little, that if we do &s;uppo&s;e a Flatne&s;s or Breadth in
the Edge thereof, it could not amount to a 500th part of the breadth of the lu|cid
Zone; and con&s;equently there could be no imaginary Rea&s;on drawn from the
Reflection thereof to &s;olve the <HI>Phaenomena:</HI> And it was believed that the Ap|pearance
would have been con&s;iderably differing, but upon trial thereof, the
&s;ame <HI>Phaenomena</HI> were as ob&s;ervable as before, without any &s;en&s;ible Variety. The
&s;ame Appearance al&s;o was vi&s;ible, when in&s;tead of the Razor, a piece of Pa&s;t|board
was u&s;ed for an opaque Body. And to obviate the other Objection, in|&s;tead
of the piece of Bra&s;s placed in the Shutter, which by a Hole in it let in
the Light, there was placed a piece of Pa&s;tboard, with a &s;mall black Hole burnt
through it: But upon trying over all the afore&s;aid Experiments with it, we
found the very &s;ame Appearances as when the Light pa&s;&s;ed through the piece of
Bra&s;s. So that upon the whole matter it was very manife&s;t, that it was &s;ome
new Propriety of Light much differing from the common Rules and Laws there|of
deliver'd in Optical and Phy&s;ical Writers. Having di&s;covered the&s;e Proprie|ties,
I proceeded farther to examine into the Nature of Light, by placing the
Razor as before, &s;o as to divide the Cone of Light into two Parts, the tran&s;|mitting
Hole remaining as before: And I placed the Paper (expo&s;ed to receive
the Circle of the Ba&s;e) &s;o as that none of the enlightned part of the Circle fell
thereupon, but only the Shadow of the Razor or opaque Body; and to my
wonder, I found a very brisk and vi&s;ible Radiation &s;triking down upon the Pa|per,
of the &s;ame breadth with the Diameter of the lucid Circle, or at lea&s;t (if
the Shadow did not divide the Circle into two equal Parts) as big as the Sub|ten&s;e
made on the &s;aid Circle by the Shadow; and this Radiation always &s;truck
perpendicularly from the &s;aid Line of Shadow, and did not only extend &s;o far
as the bredth of the remaining part of the Circle; but like the Light or Tail
of a Comet, extended more than 10 times that length, and in probability more
than a 100 times; nay, as far as I could find by many Trials, the Light from the
Edge did &s;trike downards into the Shadow very near to a Quadrant, though &s;till
I found, that the greater the Deflection of this new Light was from the direct
Radiations of the Cone, the more faint they were.</P>
<P>It was hereupon objected by &s;ome, that this Deflection of the Light was to
be a&s;cribed either to the Reflection of the Particles of Du&s;t flying to and fro in
the Air of the lucid Cone, or to &s;ome kind of Tran&s;parency and Refraction in
the Edge of the Ra&s;or.</P>
<P>But to obviate the&s;e Objections, I took care fir&s;t &s;o to hide that part of the lu|cid
Cone that was between the Hole and the Razor, that little or nothing thereof
could come to &s;hine on that part where the Radiation appeared: And next by
changing the Sides of the Razor, I placed the thick Back thereof in&s;tead of the
Edge:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Effect wholly to be a&s;cribed to a new Property of Light.</NOTE> So that if there were any thing a&s;cribable either to the Tran&s;parency, or
Figure and Superficies thereof, all tho&s;e Proprieties might be altered, and con|&s;equently
the Effects producible thereby: But upon all the variety of Changes
and Alterations and Examinations of it, this way and that way, I found the
Effects and <HI>Phaenomena</HI> the &s;ame; &s;o that it was manife&s;t, that the Effect was
a&s;cribable wholly to a new Propriety of the Rays of Light, and not at all to
<PB N="189" REF="227">
any Reflection or Refraction, or any other common Propriety of Light.</P>
<P>I proceeded yet farther to examine into the Nature of Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The&s;e Radia|tions of Light might be mo|ved.</NOTE> and finding
that there were &s;everal brighter Parts of this Radiation into the Shadow, and
others that were darker and more ob&s;cure, and that they did all &s;trike perpen|dicularly
into the Shadow; and finding al&s;o that the&s;e brighter and darker Parts
would be moved to and fro, and di&s;appear, and other new ones appear, accord|ing
as I moved and &s;lipt the Razor or &s;hadowing Body to and fro: After &s;everal
Trials I found, that where&s;oever there was a part of the &s;hadowing Body more
high than the re&s;t of the Superficies, there the Radiation into the Shadow was
brighter and more &s;trong; and where&s;oever there was a Notch or Gap in the &s;aid
Superficies, there a darker Stroke or Radiation would be: In&s;omuch that if I
fixt upon the Side of the &s;hadowing Body, a Piece of Lead, or the like (whe|ther
reflecting or not reflecting Body, 'twas the &s;ame thing) there would &s;trike
a brisk Radiation from the Shadow thereof into the Shadow of the opaque Body
perdendicularly to the Line of Shadow. If the Superficies or Bulk of the Knob
was con&s;iderably big, the Radiation would &s;trike perpendicularly to the Sides
thereof; &s;o that if the &s;hadowing Body were circular, it would &s;trike towards
a Center; and if it were concave, it would &s;trike with Radiations, as it were,
from a Center: If it were a &s;harp Angle, or Corner, it would &s;trike by a Line
dividing the Angle into two equal Parts. This al&s;o, after &s;everal Examinations
and Trials thereof, by varying Experiments, I found to be a&s;cribable to a new
Propriety of the Rays of Light, and not at all to Reflections or Refractions, or
any other commonly known Propriety of Light.</P>
<P>Proceeding farther to make Ob&s;ervations of the bigne&s;s of the Figure of the
Sun, painted by the Rays of Light admitted through the &s;mall Hole in the
Bra&s;s Plate, upon the Table or Paper expo&s;ed to receive them; I ob&s;erved that
the Limb of that Figure was always much darker than the middle Parts, and
that it was not only darker, but ragged, and not neatly and di&s;tinctly defined,
by rea&s;on of a kind of <HI>Penumbra</HI> which fringed the edge thereof. Comparing
this <HI>Penumbra</HI> with the bigne&s;s of the Hole in the Plate through which the Light
was admitted, I found that it was con&s;iderably broader than that, &s;ometimes
five or &s;ix times as broad; &s;o that I was &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied that it could not
proceed from a <HI>Penumbra</HI> cau&s;ed by the bigne&s;s of the Hole upon the common
Principles, that is, from the Suppo&s;ition of the Rays from every point of the Sun
proceeding in &s;trait Lines: For had that been &s;uppo&s;ed, the <HI>Penumbra</HI> could
not have been broader than the Diameter of the admitting Hole, as it will be
made very evident, if we examine the Progre&s;s of the Rays Geometrically,
&s;uppo&s;ing them to move always exactly in &s;trait Lines.</P>
<P>Let SN in the 9th Scheme repre&s;ent the Diameter of the Sun &s;hining through
the Hole HO,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 2. Fig. 9.</NOTE> and painting upon the Table TT the round Figure of the Sun,
who&s;e Diameter &s;uppo&s;e is DI, terminated by the Rays SOI and NHD, pro|ceeding
from the Extreams of the Sun's Diameter SN, to the oppo&s;ite Sides of
the Hole HO. Draw then from the Extremes of the Sun's Diameter S and N,
two other Rays, SM and NE, pa&s;&s;ing by the corre&s;ponding Sides of the Hole H
and O, and terminating at the Table or Paper at M and E; which la&s;t Rays,
with the preceding, will cut off from the &s;hining Circle of the Sun MI and ED.
And becau&s;e of the va&s;t Di&s;tance of the Body of the Sun from us, tho&s;e Rays
which we have here drawn diverging, will notwith&s;tanding be Phy&s;ically and
&s;en&s;ibly parallel; and con&s;equently the breadth of the <HI>Penumbra</HI> MI and DE,
mu&s;t be equal to HO the Diameter of the Hole, by the 34 <HI>pr. 1st Euclid.</HI> the Pa|per
or Table being &s;uppo&s;ed parallel to the Diameter of the Hole HO; or if we
will proceed according to the &s;trictne&s;s of Geometry, the Breadth of the <HI>Penum|bra</HI>
MI will be &s;o much greater than the Diameter of the Hole HO, as the Di|&s;tance
SI is to the Di&s;tance SO. For as SI is to SO, &s;o is MI to HO, by the 4th of
the &s;ixth of <HI>Euclid;</HI> the which Proportion being, as to the greate&s;t accuratene&s;s
of Sen&s;e, a Proportion of Equality, it follows that the <HI>Penumbra</HI> of the Disk
mu&s;t be equal, as to all &s;en&s;e, to the Diameter of the Hole; and to make the
<HI>Penumbra</HI> double to the Diameter of the Hole, the Di&s;tance of the Hole and
Paper mu&s;t be equal to the Di&s;tance of the Sun from the Hole; that is, as SI is
double to SO, &s;o will MI be double to MO. It follows therefore that this ex|traordinary
<HI>Penumbra</HI> can no way be a&s;cribable to the common Principles of
<PB N="190" REF="228">
Light, but to &s;ome new P$opriety, whereby the Light doth deflect from &s;trait
Lines, contrary to what is hitherto a&s;&s;erted by Optick Writers. Nor will the
bright Zone which I mention'd, be explicable by any of the common Rules of
Opticks: For according to the common Principles of Opticks, all the Parts of
the &s;hining or light Picture of the Sun, which lie between M and E, mu&s;t be
equally inlightned; that is, &s;uppo&s;ing the Light to proceed only by right Lines:
For every Point between E and M will be inlightned by an equal Spuce of the
Diameter of the Sun. From the Point E of the Sun draw the Line EHL; then
&s;hall LN repre&s;ent &s;uch a part of the Diameter of the Sun, as can at once in|lighten
the Point E through the Hole. Then take any other Point in the Picture
of the Sun between M and E, as &s;uppo&s;e the Point C, and from the Point C
draw two Lines touching the Extreams of the Diameter of the Hole H and O;
that is to &s;ay, CHB and COA, terminating at the Points B and A of the Sun;
I &s;ay, that BA &s;hall be equal to LN. For &s;ince SN, HO, and TT are Parallels,
HC will be to BC, as HE to LE. But as HE to LE, &s;o is HO to LN; and as
HC to BC, &s;o is HO to BA. Therefore as HO is to LN, &s;o is HO to BA; and
con&s;equently BA and LN are equal; and con&s;equently every Point of the Picture
of the Sun painted by the Rays on the Table TT, between the Points E and M,
ought to be equally inlightned by the Rays pa&s;&s;ing through the Hole HO; &s;ince
every of them is inlightned by an equal part of the Diameter of the Sun's Di&s;$k,
which is contrary to the Ob&s;ervations that $ have made; and therefore the Rays
of the Sun which cro&s;s each other in the Hole of the Shutter HO, do not pro|ceed
on in &s;trait Lines, but deflect, &s;ome this way, &s;ome that way, as I &s;hall
hereafter more at large declare, when I &s;hall &s;hew divers other $trange <HI>Phaenomena</HI>
of Light, both in Direct, Reflected and Refracted Rays; whereby are produ|ced
Colours, Light and Heat, and various Pictures of the Objects without:
For according to this or that Variety of the quantity of Light admitted, &s;o would
the Effects be exceedingly differing as to Light, Heat and Colours. And I al&s;o
further ob&s;erved, that the widening or &s;treightning of the Hole would alter the
<HI>Penumbra,</HI> and that a &s;maller Hole would make a larger <HI>Penumbra,</HI> which is
contrary to the common Principles of Opticks: For if the Rays went in &s;trait
Lines, the bigger the Hole were, the bigger would be the <HI>Penumbra.</HI> The&s;e
things I have deliver'd to you as briefly and &s;uccinctly as I could. The other
<HI>Phaenomena,</HI> God willing, I &s;hall hereafter deliver to you more at large.</P>
<P>&startq;IN reference to the foregoing Experiment of Light, I found a Paper to this
purpo&s;e. On the 18th of <HI>March</HI> 1674-75 Mr. <HI>Hooke</HI> read a Di&s;cour&s;e con|cerning
the Nature and Properties of Light, in which was contained &s;everal
new Properties of Light not ob&s;erved, that he knew, by any Optick Writers:
The&s;e were, That there is a Deflection of Light differing both from Reflection
and Refraction, and &s;eeming to depend upon the unequal Den&s;ity of the con|&s;tituent
Parts of the Ray, whereby the Light is di&s;per&s;ed from the Place of
Conden&s;ation, and ra$ify'd or gradually diverged into a Quadrant. 2dly, He
ob&s;erved that this Deflection is made toward the Superficies of the op$cous
Body perpendicularly. 3dly, That in this Deflection of the Rays, tho&s;e Parts
of diverged Radiation that are deflected by the greate&s;t Angle from the &s;trait or
direct Radiations&punc; are fainte&s;t, and tho&s;e that are deflected by the lea&s;t, are
&s;tronge&s;t. 4ly, That the Rays cutting each o$ehr in one common <HI>Foramen,</HI>
do not make the Angles <HI>ad Verticem</HI> equal. 5ly, That Colours may be made
without Refraction, 6ly, That the true bigne&s;s of the Sun's Diameter cannot
be taken with common Sights. 7ly, That the &s;ame Rays of Light falling
upon the &s;ame point of the Object, will turn into all &s;orts of Colours only
by the various Inclination of the Object. 8ly, That Colours begin to appear,
when two Pul&s;es of Light are blended &s;o well and near together, that the
Sen&s;e takes them for one.</P>
<Q>The two following Fragments of <HI>Gravity</HI> and <HI>Magneti&s;m,</HI> I found among&s;t &s;ome

<P>AFter the Explication of Light and Gravity, I come in the 3d place to the
Explication of Magneti&s;m. Magneti&s;m then is a certain Power in the

fir&s;t ob&s;erved in the Heavens by Dr. Childrey,
about the Vernal Aequinox, and by Mon&s;. Ca&s;|&s;ini
and others. This Lecture was read before the
Royal Society, June the 3d 1685.</HEAD>
<P>DOctor <HI>Childrey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 183.</NOTE> at the End of his <HI>Britannia Baconica,</HI> which he puli&s;hed in
the Year 1660, containing &s;everal very curious Ob&s;ervations made by him|&s;elf
and others, has this Adverti&s;ement to the Curious and Ingenious. There is
a thing which I mu&s;t needs recommend to the Ob&s;ervation or Mathematical
Men, which is, that in <HI>February,</HI> and for a little before, and a little after that
Month (as I have ob&s;erved &s;everal Years together) about 6 in the Evening, when
the Twilight hath almo&s;t deferred the Horizon, you &s;hall &s;ee a plainly di&s;cern|able
way of the Twilight &s;triking up toward the <HI>Pleiades,</HI> or Seven Stars, and
&s;eeming almo&s;t to touch them. It is to be ob&s;erved any cle$r Night. There is
no &s;uch Way to be ob&s;erved at any other time of the Year, that I can perceive,
nor any other Way at that time to be perceived da$ting up el&s;ewhere. And I
believe it hath been and will be con&s;tantly vi&s;ible at that time of the Year: But
what the Cau&s;e of it in Nature &s;hould be, I cannot yet imagine. So far the Doctor
di&s;cour&s;ing with this Gentleman about a Year or two after this Publication, he
could not then think of any Cau&s;e of it, unle&s;s perhaps it might be &s;ome
extraordinary Reflection of the Sun Beams, cau&s;ed by &s;ome part of the We&s;tern
Ocean; but could not be po&s;itive, but doubted whether this might be a Cau&s;e
or not. This Tr$ct of Dr. <HI>Childrey</HI>'s was tran&s;lated into <HI>French,</HI> and printed in
the Year 1667, as appears by the <HI>Mi&s;$ellanea Curio&s;a Academi$ Naturae Curio|&s;orum;</HI>
and by that means the Adverti&s;ement was &s;pread in <HI>France,</HI> and the re&s;t
of <HI>Europe.</HI> In the 1$th Journal <HI>des Scauans</HI> of the Year 1683. we have an Ac|count
of a Sight the mo&s;t rare that has been ob&s;erved in the Heavens, de&s;cri|bed
by Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> thus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>Cassini's</HI> Ob&s;ervations.</NOTE> &startq;A Light, like that which blanches the Milky Way,
but more clear and &s;hining in the middle, but more faint towards the Ex|treams,
was expanded over tho&s;e Signs which the Sun was &s;hortly to pa&s;s
through. I began to &s;ee it at the <HI>Royal Ob&s;ervatory,</HI> the 18th of <HI>March St. N.</HI>
two Days before the <HI>Aequinox,</HI> upon the occa&s;ion of turning the Tele&s;cope
(with which I had been viewing the Changes of <HI>Saturn</HI>) to &s;ee the 1&s;t Star
of <HI>Aries,</HI> which is compo&s;ed of two, di&s;tant only the Sum of their Dia|meters.
I &s;aw this Con&s;tellation, and that of <HI>Taurus</HI> more light than ordi|nary,
about &frac34; after 7 of the Clock, which was &frac12; an hour after the Evening
Twilight. The We&s;t End of this Light was terminated by Horizon Clouds
about 3 Degrees high, the Breadth of the cleare&s;t part was about 8 or 9
Degrees: It was extended obliquely near the <HI>Zodiac,</HI> and &s;heer'd by the North
&s;ide of the two brighte&s;t Stars in the Head of <HI>Aries,</HI> comprehending all the
Body. It extended in Length over the 7 Stars, and ended in&s;en&s;ibly in the
Head of <HI>Taurus.</HI> That part of the Heaven was &s;o very clear, that Stars of
the 6th and 7th Magnitude could be plainly &s;een, even in the middle of it,
which was the brighte&s;t, as is &s;ometimes &s;een in the Tails of Comets. But
'twas too great for the Tail of a Comet, tho' it re&s;pected the Sun, and de&s;cen|ded
behind the Clouds, without altering its Situation among the Stars. It
continued to appear for &s;ome Days, but alter'd not its Po&s;ition, tho' it grew
fainter by degrees. The 26th of <HI>March (St. N.)</HI> which was the la&s;t
Night he then &s;aw it) it &s;eemed to be moved &s;omewhat more towards the
North than at fir&s;t, which &s;ome Ob&s;ervations of it in <HI>April</HI> following farther
confirmed. I pa&s;s over his comparing of it to other <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> becau&s;e I
take them to be of another nature. As for the Cau&s;e of it, he takes it to be
either from the Head of &s;ome Comet hid under the Sun's Rays, which yet he
<PB N="194" REF="232">
doubts to a&s;&s;ert, becau&s;e of its Breadth, or from the Sun's Body it &s;elf; but
determines nothing. He takes its Di&s;tance to be great, approaching towards
the Fixed Stars, above the Planets, becau&s;e it chang'd its Place &s;o very little
in the time it appear'd.&endq;</P>
<P>In the <HI>Nouvelles des Livres</HI> of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, is in&s;erted a Letter of Mr. <HI>Choi$et,</HI>
Profe&s;&s;or of Philo&s;ophy at <HI>Geneva,</HI> giving a further Account of the Ob&s;ervation
of it at that Place the la&s;t Spring, <HI>viz.</HI> 1684. by Mr. <HI>Fatio de Duillier,</HI> to this
effect. &startq;That 'tis a great Light, like the Tail of &s;ome Comet, who&s;e Head
is ab&s;conded in the Sun's Rays, appearing &s;ometime in the We&s;t, &s;ometime in
the Ea&s;t, after and before the Twilight, but always near the Sun. '$is al|ways
near the Plain of the Ecliptick, and re&s;pects the Sun. The End next
the Sun is about 14 Degrees broad, at about 40 Degrees from the Sun, and
from thence goes about 30 Degrees farther, dimini&s;hing in Breadth and Bright|ne&s;s,
and ending in almo&s;t a Point. It is brighte&s;t through the middle, yet
even through that &s;mall Stars may be &s;een.&endq;</P>
<P>This admirable Appearance, &s;ays he, was fir&s;t ob&s;erved by the Illu&s;trious
<HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> in <HI>March</HI> and <HI>April</HI> 1683, where Mr. <HI>Fatio</HI> was pre&s;ent and a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the
Ob&s;ervation: And returning to <HI>Geneva,</HI> he ob&s;erved it in <HI>March,</HI> but was much
&s;urprized to find it again by chance in <HI>Feb.</HI> 1684. which made him frame the
following <HI>Hypothe&s;is, viz.</HI> that he was in part of the &s;ame Opinion with Mr.
<HI>Ca&s;&s;ini,</HI> that the Light was cau&s;ed by &s;ome more reflecting or refracting Parts
expanded into the Aether in that place which conveyed the Sun's Beams to our
Sight: But differ'd al&s;o from him, 1&s;t, In that Mr. <HI>Fatio</HI> &s;uppo&s;es it &s;pread about
the Sun's Body mo&s;t about the Plain of the Ecliptick, extending far beyond the
Orb of <HI>Venus,</HI> and even almo&s;t to the Orb of the Earth. 2ly, In that he &s;up|po&s;es
this Luminous Matter about the Sun not to be a Globe, but only a taper|ing
Circle in the Plain of the Ecliptick: So that it is much thicker near the Sun,
where it doth to a great thickne&s;s inclo&s;e him; but as it &s;preads further and fur|ther
from it, &s;o it grows thinner. 3ly, That this Matter is carried round about
the Sun by the Motion of the Heavens, in the Plain of the Ecliptick, and termi|nates
at the Orb of <HI>Venus.</HI></P>
<P>To make out which <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> he affirms to have &s;een the like Glade of Light
in the Morning before the Twilight in <HI>September,</HI> and both before the Morning
Twilight, and after the Evening Twilight in <HI>December.</HI> But this I do not find
ob&s;erved by any one el&s;e.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Hypothe&s;es, tho' ingenious, do not give &s;o &s;atisfactory an Account
of this Appearance, as I conceive; e&s;pecially the fir&s;t, which is indeed not limi|ted
enough to make it de$erve the Name of an Hypothe&s;is; and for the 2d, I
conceive no rea&s;on why it &s;hould not every Night and every Morning that is clear,
and without much Moonlight, be vi&s;ible round the Year; e&s;pecially in the Tor|rid
Zone, where the Ecliptick ri&s;es more perpendicular. Which I do not find
hath been noted, nor does it appear every Year: For I my &s;elf (for two or three
Years after I fir&s;t &s;aw the beforemention'd Adverti&s;ement of Dr. <HI>Childrey,</HI> which
was, as I remember, in 1662, 1663, and 1664) looked diligently for it, but
found it not. And Dr. <HI>Childrey</HI> him&s;elf told me, that he had never found it at
any other Time of the Year: However it will be very well worth looking after.</P>
<P>Comparing all the&s;e Ob&s;ervations together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Author's Opinion of its Cau&s;e.</NOTE> my Conjectures are, that this Ap|pearance
is cau&s;ed by &s;ome <HI>Effluvia</HI> from the Body of the Earth it &s;elf, produced
by the near Approach of it to the Sun, when in and near its <HI>Perihelium,</HI> which
<HI>Perihelium</HI> being about the 5th or 6th Degree of <HI>Taurus</HI> for the Sun's Place, or
of <HI>Cancer</HI> for the Earth's Place, is on the 16th or 17th Day of <HI>December.</HI> By
which Approach of the Body of the Earth to the Sun, I conceive that a more
than ordinary Rarifaction is made of the Parts of the <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> and the
Dimen&s;ions thereof accordingly extended to a much greater di&s;tance than at any
other times of its periodick Revolution: And the annual Motion being then al&s;o
proportionably increa&s;ed in Swiftne&s;s, many of the more than ordinarily rari|fy'd
Parts of this <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI> may be for a time converted into a kind of <HI>Aether,</HI>
and be thereby intimately mixed and united with it, and &s;o be left by the &s;wift|ly
moving Ball in the Vicinities of its Pa&s;&s;age through the <HI>Aether,</HI> where for
&s;ome time after it may remain perfectly ircorporated with the Parts of the
<HI>Aether:</HI> But the extraordinary Heat reflected from the Body of the Earth, hav|ing
<PB N="195" REF="233">
left it for &s;ome time, the&s;e Aerial Vapours begin to lo&s;e that Form, and con|den&s;e
again into a Sub&s;tance &s;omewhat like the rarify'd Air, out of which they
had been generated by the Coaction of the Sun and Earth. Which Conden&s;a|tion
makes them of a differing Tran&s;parency from the re&s;t of the <HI>Aether,</HI> and
thereby capable both of reflecting and refracting the Rays of the Sun pa&s;&s;ing
that way, and &s;o make them to become vi&s;ible to the Earth in that place of its
Orbit where they had been left, and &s;o continue, till by Degrees they be di&s;per|&s;ed
and &s;catter'd into a greater &s;pace or quantity of the <HI>Aether,</HI> and at length
wholly di&s;appear. To make this the more conceivable, and al&s;o more &s;en|&s;ible
and probable, I could produce an Experiment in more &s;en&s;ible and tan|gible
Bodies, that would perfectly repre&s;ent all the Particulars remarkable
in the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, making u&s;e of Fire to repre&s;ent the Heat of the <HI>Sun,</HI>
of <HI>Water</HI> to repre&s;ent the <HI>Air</HI> or <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> and of <HI>Air</HI> to repre&s;ent the
<HI>Aether;</HI> whereby the &s;ame <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> at lea&s;t very &s;imilar, would be plainly
vi&s;ible, re&s;pect being only had to the proportionate Differences between the Bo|dies
repre&s;enting and repre&s;ented, and the Times of producing the Changes ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to exhibit the mention'd <HI>Phaenomena</HI> both of the one and the other Ob|&s;ervation.
But that I think will not be nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince none that has made any
Ob&s;ervations at all, can be ignorant of them. 'Tis known to all, that Heat,
whether of the Sun, Fire, or an Animal Body, will make Water &s;o incorporate
with the Air, as to wa&s;te away into it, without being at all vi&s;ible, or altering
the Tran&s;parency of it, as we every moment are &s;en&s;ible of it in our Breathing.
'Tis as well known likewi&s;e, if the Air be very cold into which we breath, the
Vaporous Parts will pre&s;ently conden&s;e, &s;o as to become vi&s;ible. 'Tis as well
known al&s;o, that &s;uch Vapors, if the Air be warm, do &s;pread them&s;elves into
the circumjacent Parts of the <HI>Aether,</HI> and will by degrees be wholly lo&s;t and
di&s;per&s;ed. 'Tis likewi&s;e known, if &s;uch a reaking Body be moved through the
Air, it will leave the Air through which it pa&s;&s;es, infec$ed by it; which Infe|ction
will &s;pread laterally, and be broader than the Line of Motion. And the
like may be &s;aid of all the other <HI>Phaenomena</HI> nece&s;&s;ary to make a &s;en&s;ible Repre|&s;entation
of this notable Appearance.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing then that this is the Cau&s;e of this Appearance, the Rea&s;on will be
plain, why it appears at that Place, at that time of the Year, of &s;uch a breadth
at the We&s;t end, and &s;o &s;harp at the Ea&s;t; why of &s;uch a Length, why 'tis
brighte&s;t in the middle, why fainter towards the Edges, why extended in or near
the Plain of the Ecliptick, why it varies this way or that way, why it keeps
its place among the Stars &s;o long, and the like; which I am ready to explain
more fully, if any Doubt.</P>
<P>Again&s;t this Hypothe&s;is &s;everal Objections may be made, as</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> If this were the Cau&s;e of this Appearance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Objections a|gain&s;t the Hy|pothe&s;is an|&s;wered.</NOTE> the <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI> of the Earth,
and con&s;equently the moi&s;t or watery part thereof would in time wa&s;te and
con&s;umed, and &s;o the World would be unfit for the U&s;es it was de&s;igned,
nourishing Vegetables and Animals.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, that it may po&s;&s;ibly be true, that the Moi&s;ture of the
Earth may have always for the time pa&s;t, and may al&s;o at pre&s;ent, and for the
future, proceed to wa&s;te; and con&s;equently the Earth may have grown drier,
and continue &s;o to do. There is &s;ufficient ground to believe, that a great part
of the Land that is now dry, and a con&s;iderable height above the Level of the
Sea, hath been in former Times covered by the Sea, which the Shells now
found do &s;ufficiently evidence; and by what means it comes to be &s;o, is not &s;o
well known or proved. There are other Parts, as <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> which have in for|mer
Times been much more &s;ucculent and fruitful than they are at pre&s;ent, being
now Rocky, Sandy, and Barren.</P>
<P>But &s;econdly, To &s;upply this Wa&s;ting, it may be alledged, that the continual
Gravity of the Earth doth make the heavier Parts thereof to get lower, and
clo&s;er together; and thereby the Watery and Aerial Parts, that have fill'd the
former Cavities and Inter&s;tities thereof, may be &s;queezed out into the Sea and
<HI>Atmo&s;phere:</HI> And &s;o as the Body of the Earth may have by this means &s;hrunk,
<PB N="196" REF="234">
and be grown le&s;&s;er and &s;hrivelled; &s;o the Watery and Atmo&s;pherical Parts
about its Surface, may in &s;ome proportion to its pre&s;ent bigne&s;s be &s;upplied.</P>
<P>Thirdly, 'Tis not unlikely, but that, as the extraordinary Heat of the Sun up|on
the Earth, when it is in its <HI>Perihelion,</HI> may for a time convert &s;ome parts of
the <HI>Atmo&s;phere</HI> into <HI>Aether,</HI> and the extraordinary Swiftne&s;s of the Earth may
leave them behind; &s;o the le&s;&s;er Heat of the Sun upon the Earth, when in its
<HI>Aphelion,</HI> may &s;uffer the Parts of the <HI>Aether</HI> to be converted into Air, and by the
&s;lower Motion of the Earth in that part, be taken hold of and carried with it,
and afterwards be further converted into Water, and &s;o repair what was lo&s;t in
the <HI>Perihelion.</HI> I &s;hall not mention that we find further, that Waters do petri|$y,
and petrify'd Sub&s;tances again revert into watery, that being more proper to another Head.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It may be objected, That if this were the true Cau&s;e, why &s;hould
not the like happen to the other Planets, as particularly to the Moon, who&s;e
Glade would be &s;een every New Moon, especially in <HI>November, December,</HI> and <HI>January.</HI></P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That 'tis not undeniably proved, that any of the primary Planets have
Water, or Atmo&s;phere about them; and &s;o though they may have as great or
greater Vici&s;&s;itudes than the Earth in re&s;pect of the Sun; yet this Tail would
not be produced without an Aerial or Atmo&s;pherical Sub&s;tance fi$ly prepared to
receive the&s;e Changes. And for the Moon, 'tis mo&s;t probable it hath none, and
if it ever had, may have been thus wa&s;ted, and be now grown dry and rocky.</P>
<P>But &s;econdly, Suppo&s;ing they really have the &s;ame Sub&s;tances about them, as
the Atmo&s;phere is about the Earth, and that &s;uch a Tail &s;hould be really produ|ced
by them; yet for two Rea&s;ons they could not be &s;een by us. The fir&s;t is
from the great Di&s;tance of them from our Sight in the Primary Planets; and
&s;econdly, the direct View of &s;uch a Tail, if it were produced by the Moon&punc;
For the Moon moving about the Earth, the Eye on the Earth mu&s;t always look
upon &s;uch a Tail or Stream tran&s;ver&s;ly, and $o being but thin, cannot be &s;een:
But in this of the Earth, the Eye looks upon it end ways; and &s;o, though rare of
it &s;elf, yet the Length of it being turned towards the Eye, it appears much the
more den&s;e, and becomes vi&s;ible in a dark and clear Evening.</P>
<P>This <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> I thought the more worthy con&s;ideration, becau&s;e it was
fir&s;t di&s;covered and publi&s;hed to the World, by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman, and be|cau&s;e,
that if the Rea&s;on thereof be what I have here &s;uppo&s;ed, it may help
to give an account of abundance of other <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> who&s;e Cau&s;es have been
a&s;cribed to very differring Principles and Agents.</P>
<P>I propounded the la&s;t Wedne&s;day an <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> for the Solution of that <HI>Phae|nomenon,</HI>
that appears in the We&s;t after the Twilight, like the Tail or Glade of
a Comet. And having &s;ince met with &s;everal other Objections again&s;t it, be|&s;ides
tho&s;e I then an&s;wer'd, I thought it might not be impertinent to give a fur|ther
and more compleat Explication of it; and that the rather, becau&s;e I find
that &s;everal of them have proceeded from a mi&s;taken Conception of the Theory
it &s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore explain all tho&s;e Particulars more exactly by Schemes and
Delineations, which may &s;erve to give a more perfect Idea thereof.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t repre&s;ents the Ball of the Earth encompa&s;&s;ed with an Atmo&s;pherical
Shell or Cover,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plate 3. Fig. 1.</NOTE> compo&s;ed the greate&s;t part of <HI>Aether,</HI> but tinctured by rarify'd
Particles of Water, Vapours or Air, which are &s;till more rarify'd and expanded,
and fewer; and the nearer to the Nature of <HI>Aether,</HI> the further they are
di&s;tant from the Surface of the Earth.</P>

it in a <HI>Vortice,</HI> as <HI>Des Cartes,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed; but quie&s;cent, according to that Theo|ry
of Cele&s;tial Motions which I long &s;ince have explained and &s;hewn to
this Society, which deduces the Cau&s;e of their periodick Motions from an im|pre&s;t
direct Motion, and an attractive or protruding Impul&s;e towards the Center
of the Sun.</P>
<P>By means of the &s;wift Motion of which Body thro' this &s;tagnant <HI>Aether,</HI> I
conceive there may be &s;ome of the higher and more rarify'd Parts of the <HI>Atmo|&s;phere</HI>
left behind, and not carried along with it, they being for that time more
intimately united to the <HI>Aether;</HI> but that tho&s;e Parts, after they have for &s;ome
time been &s;eparated, may alter or lo&s;e their Rarefaction, and &s;o become for a
time vi&s;ible to the Eye upon the Earth, now removed at a great di&s;tance from
them.</P>
<P>The third repre&s;ents the &s;ame in the Orbit of the Earth about the Sun, &s;hew|ing
this Sub&s;tance left in that part of the Orbit which neare&s;t approaches the
Body of the Sun, where its Power and Heat is more inten&s;e, and where the
Motion of the Body of the Earth is much more rapid than in other Parts of its
Orbit. From which two Cau&s;es, I conceive, the Earth leaves an Impre&s;&s;ion or
Sign of its way through the <HI>Aether,</HI> &s;omewhat like the Froth left in the Wake
of a Ship pa&s;&s;ing &s;wiftly through the Water, which may be &s;een by one look|ing
from the Poop of the Ship a good way behind, like a white Line, and has
&s;ometimes in a dark Night appeared to &s;hine.</P>
<P>Nor is this the only In&s;tance; for I conceive there are very few, if any, here
pre&s;ent, who have not &s;een the &s;hining Line left behind by the Meteors called
Falling Stars, or Star Shootings.</P>
<P>This al&s;o repre&s;ents the Po&s;ition or Angle of it in re&s;pect of the Sun, as al&s;o
the Length of it, and the manner how that End of it which is next the Sun,
&s;preads, and the other End is &s;harp, and hew the middle becomes more bright
and con&s;picuous than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The 4th repre&s;ents the &s;ame Orbit of the Earth drawn in &s;mall, and &s;o ma|nife&s;ts
the Rea&s;on why that part of the Orbit appears to the Earth in <HI>Virgo</HI>
and <HI>Libra,</HI> among&s;t the Fixt Stars of the Con&s;tellation of <HI>Aries</HI> and <HI>Taurus.</HI></P>
<P>The right understanding of this Theory will plainly &s;hew a Rea&s;on why it
had &s;o little, if any Parallax at all; which made <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> &s;uppo&s;e it higher than
the Planets, and <HI>Chouet</HI> that it was about the Sun: For by the Scheme it plainly
appears, that it mu&s;t be for the mo&s;t part of it further di&s;tant than the Sun.</P>
<P>The chief Objections that I have &s;ince met with are the&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Objecti|ons an&s;wered.</NOTE></P>
<P>1. How the <HI>Aether,</HI> which is &s;o exceeding thin and fluid a Body, can detain or
&s;top any part of the Atmo&s;phere in the Tran&s;it of the Ear$h, and why the Gra|vity
of the Earth, which carries along with it the Moon, according to my
Theory, which is &s;o va&s;tly much more di&s;tant, &s;hould not be able to carry with
it all the Parts of the Atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>2. Tho' the <HI>Aether</HI> &s;hould thus retain part of the Atmo&s;phere, as I &s;uppo&s;e,
yet why this retained Sub&s;tance &s;hould not appear &s;ooner, and how it &s;hould
continue &s;o long after, without being wholly di&s;per&s;ed into the <HI>Aether.</HI></P>
<P>3. Why this Separation, or marked Way, &s;hould be left only when the Earth
is in its <HI>Perihelion,</HI> and not all the Year, in every part of its Orbit.</P>
<P>4. Why this Glade &s;hould not appear the &s;ame every Year, &s;ince the Earth
moves the &s;ame Trace through the &s;ame <HI>Aether;</HI> and &s;o at the &s;ame Times or
Places of its Orbit, it has the &s;ame Influences both from the Sun and the <HI>Aether.</HI></P>
<P>To the fir&s;t I an&s;wer, That tho' the <HI>Aether</HI> be exceeding fluid, yet both from
Ob&s;ervation and Experiments it affords &s;ome Re&s;i&s;tance to Bodies moved through
it. Fir&s;t by Ob&s;ervation it has been, I think, always found that the Tail, Blaze
or Glade of Comets, has not been exactly directed or pointed from the Sun, but
hath always had an Inclination backwards, that is, towards the Place from
whence the Comet is moved, as I have publi&s;hed in my Ob&s;ervations concerning
Comets; the Blaze of a Comet in this &s;omewhat re&s;embling the A&s;cent of the
<PB N="198" REF="237">
Flame of a Candle, when it is moved &s;ideways through the Air. But &s;econdly,
by experiment we find, that though the Motion of a <HI>Pendulum in vacuo</HI> will
be much more free, and la&s;t a con&s;iderable time longer than the Motion of a
<HI>Pendulum in pleno A$re;</HI> yet even this will in &s;ome &s;hort time al&s;o lo&s;e its Mo|tion,
and &s;tand &s;till, as I have manife&s;ted to this Society by former Experiments
purpo&s;ely made. 3ly, Tho' the gravitating or attracting Power of the Earth be
able to retain and carry the Moon along with it in its annual Orbit, the Moon
being a Body of a va&s;t Bulk or Solidity, compar'd to the Fluidity and &s;mall
Re&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Aether</HI> through which it moves: Yet, as I &s;hall afterwards
prove in my Theory of Lunar Motions, the Impediment of the <HI>Aether</HI> hath a
very con&s;iderable Influence upon it, and produceth very &s;en&s;ible Effects, tho' they
are a&s;cribed to differing Cau&s;es. But on the other hand, the Solidity of the
Parts which &s;erve to exhibit this <HI>Phaenomenon,</HI> are &s;o very &s;mall, and &s;o near
approaching to the Nature of the <HI>Aether,</HI> that the Stagnancy of the <HI>Aether</HI> hath
a con&s;iderable Influence and Effect upon them.</P>
<P>For an&s;wer to the 2d Objection, 1&s;t, I &s;ay, that I &s;uppo&s;e it when &s;eparated
from the Atmo&s;phere, to be &s;o near of the &s;ame Nature of the <HI>Aether</HI> with which
it is mixed, that it di&s;covers not its e&s;&s;ential Difference, till it hath been for
&s;ome time &s;eparated from the Atmo&s;phere; but then when the Reflective Influ|ence
of the Earth hath been for &s;ome time wanting to it, It doth by degrees
re-a&s;&s;ume its preceding Form, and by degrees revert into the Form of Air, Va|pours
or Water, and &s;o becomes of a differing Nature from the <HI>Aether,</HI> and
&s;erves to reflect the Rays of the Sun towards the Earth.</P>
<P>2ly, The Nearne&s;s of its Qualification to the <HI>Aether,</HI> makes it more &s;low in
altering its Form. Of this we have In&s;tances enough in the Atmo&s;phere in a
dry Sea&s;on, as at this pre&s;ent, when though the Air be plen$$$ully charged with
watery Vapours and Exhalations, yet they continue for a long time in the form
of the Air, being not di&s;coverable from the more permanent Body of the Air it
&s;elf, by any difference of Refractivene&s;s, till by &s;ome other Cau&s;e unknown, they
be converted again into the Form of Water in &s;mall Globules, or Drops, and &s;o
appear in form &s;o Clouds, many of which Drops uniting into one, form a Drop of
Rain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Rain.</NOTE> and &s;o fall down to the Earth. This unknown Cau&s;e &s;eems to be &s;ome|times
extraordinary Heat, whereby one part is converted into Lightning, upon
which another presently reverts into Water or Rain, and falls down in Thunder
Showers. At other times it &s;eems to be extraordinary Cold,, as one may judge
by the falling down of tho&s;e Drops in the form of Ice, as in Hail Showers.</P>
<P>3ly, If we con&s;ider the va&s;t height from the Surface of the Earth, to which the Parts of the Atmo&s;phere a&s;cend, which exhibit the Twilight, which <HI>Cardan</HI>
believes to be almo&s;t 800 Miles, tho' <HI>Ricciolus,</HI> and others more moderate, &s;up|po&s;e
it not above 100 Miles high; we may ea&s;ily a&s;&s;ent, that &s;ome of tho&s;e
Parts may be left in the <HI>Aether,</HI> con&s;idering the Stagnancy of the <HI>Aether,</HI> and
the exceeding great Swiftne&s;s of the &s;olid Globe of the Earth through the &s;ame.
But then if we con&s;ider the Parts of the Atmo&s;phere not Refractive, they may
be &s;uppo&s;ed very much more elevated, even to the height of a Diameter of the
Earth. But if they are &s;uppo&s;ed le&s;s than 50, which the mo&s;t moderate allow,
yet they will be high enough to be left behind by the &s;wiftly moving Ball of
the Earth.</P>
<P>To the Third Objection, why this Train or Stream &s;hould be left when
the Earth is in its <HI>Perihelium,</HI> and not as well at all other Times and Places
of its Revolution, I an&s;wer, That there being a manife&s;t difference of a
Cau&s;e 'tis rational enough to &s;uppo&s;e there may be a &s;en&s;ible difference
of Effect. 'Tis by other ways proved that the Earth is in that part of its
Orbit nearer the Sun, and that its Motion is then and there proportionably
&s;wifter; if then we can ob&s;erve a different <HI>Phaenomenon,</HI> 'tis rational to a&s;cribe
it to that different Cau&s;e, till a more certain be found. Now that &s;uch a Cau&s;e

<HI>Perigeo,</HI> as he that li&s;ts to calculate, or search the <HI>Ephemerides</HI> for tho&s;e
Years, will find.&endq; And the &s;ame Doctor, in the beginning of his Book, adds
an Adverti&s;ement of an Ob&s;ervation he made before that Book was quite prin|ted
off, <HI>viz.</HI> &startq;That on the 1&s;t of <HI>November</HI> 1660, between 10 a Clock at
Night, and 5 next Morning, happen'd an unu&s;ual &s;hifting of the Tides in the
<HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>London</HI> ebbing and flowing three times, as 'tis reported, in that
&s;pace; which, &s;ays he, was when the Moon was almo&s;t in the very place&punc; of
her <HI>Perigaeum.</HI></P>
<P>To which let me add one Ob&s;ervation more to the Doctor's, That all the&s;e
<HI>Phaenomena</HI> hapned when the Earth was very near its <HI>Perihelium,</HI> and within the
Limits of this &s;uppo&s;ed Luminous Glade or Wake, as I may call it, of the
Earth; and 'tis not impo&s;&s;ible but that this greater Nearne&s;s of the Body of the
Earth to the Fire of the Sun, may make it emit more copious, and other na|tured
Steams than at other times, when not &s;o much roa&s;ted by the Heat of the
Sun.</P>
<P>As to the 4th Objection, why this &s;hould not appear every Year the &s;ame, I
answer, that there may be many Cau&s;es or Rea&s;ons to make one Year con&s;ide|rably
differ from another, as is &s;ufficiently manife&s;t by the Variety of Weather of
one Year from another. But to determine po&s;itively what is the Cau&s;e, does
require a greater number, and more exact Ob&s;ervations than have been hitherto
made of it.</P>
<P>Having under&s;tood that there yet remains one Objection again&s;t the <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI>
I have proupo&s;ed for &s;olving the Glade of Light appearing in the We&s;t in <HI>Februa|ry,
March,</HI> and <HI>April;</HI> and that is, again&s;t the Stagnancy of the <HI>Aether,</HI> and
its &s;taying of Atmo&s;pherical Parts within it from following the Motion of the
Earth. I &s;hall thereupon mention two <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> which I conceive, when they are
well con&s;idered, will give &s;ome probable Argument for this Opinion; and tho&s;e
are two of the &s;ame Kind or Nature, but ob&s;erved at different Times and Pla|ces.
The fir&s;t I &s;shall mention,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a Lampas Volans.</NOTE> tho' the la&s;t in time, was the Fax or <HI>Lampas
Volans</HI> ob&s;erved after Sun-&s;et the 1&s;t: of <HI>March</HI> 1676, at <HI>Fau&mdash;by Petrus de
Lauina;</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> by Mon&s;. <HI>Auzout;</HI> at <HI>Florence</HI> by <HI>Matthias del Arpi;</HI> at <HI>Ve|nice</HI>
by <HI>Jo. Jacob Hertz,</HI> and in &s;everal other Cities of <HI>Italy;</HI> in all which it
was &s;een al&s;o by very many others, and at the &s;ame time al&s;o was ob&s;erved in
the Lower Parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> as at <HI>Triers</HI> by the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> there; Places very far
di&s;tant one from another; yet the Time and Manner of Appearance in all was
much the &s;ame. It &s;eemed to ri&s;e out of the North Ea&s;t, and to pa&s;s by the
Meridian to the South We&s;tern Parts of the Heavens, near the &s;ame Tract that
the Sun had gone that Day, and di&s;appeared behind thick Clouds, where with
a mighty Noi&s;e it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be blown to pieces and di&s;per&s;ed. It ap|peared
about the bigne&s;s of the Full Moon, and left behind it a Tail about 3
Diameters, of a reddi&s;h Flame at fir&s;t, but turning blui&s;h towards the la&s;t. It
la&s;ted about a Minute or two. Its Noi&s;e at la&s;t was like the Noi&s;e of an Earth|quake
at a di&s;tance, and made the Gla&s;s in the Windows &s;hake. From the
comparing of &s;everal Ob&s;ervations, 'twas &s;uppo&s;ed about 90 Miles high, and
near a Mile in Diameter. The &s;everal Authors that have writ concerning it,
have explicated it by an Hypothe&s;is very different from mine. My Conceptions
of it are the&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That it was a vaporous Steam much of the &s;ame nature with that which
makes Lightning rai&s;ed into the Superior Parts of the Air by means of its own
<PB N="200" REF="239">
innate Heat and Rarefraction, which might po&s;&s;ibly proceed from &s;ome &s;ubter|raneous
Operation in &s;ome Parts of the Ea&s;t lying far di&s;tant from <HI>Italy,</HI> as <HI>China,</HI>
or &s;ome other Part where there might be &s;ome Earthquake, or po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome Ir|ruption,
by which it might be &s;ent out in great plenty, and forced up with
great Power and Swiftne&s;s, that remaining there &s;ome time, it might from the
Cold or want of Heat of tho&s;e higher Regions, by degrees be conden&s;ed and
conglobated nearer together, and by the Operation of the more Aethereal part
of the Atmo&s;phere, be prepared for Accen&s;ion; and &s;o being kindled, it would
continue &s;ome &s;mall time before it &s;et fire to the middle Parts thereof, at which
time it &s;eemed to imitate the Noi&s;e of Thunder afar off. Now that Particular
for which I mention it, is the way of its apparent Motion, which was &s;aid to be
much the &s;ame with the Sun that Day, ri&s;ing Ea&s;tward, and pa&s;&s;ing by the Me|ridian
towards the We&s;t. This, I conceive, was cau&s;ed by the Diurnal Motion
of the Earth, whereby the Parts where it was &s;een being moved very &s;wiftly
towards the Ea&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> about 12 or 14 Miles in a Minute, the higher Parts of
the Atmo&s;phere in which it was kindled, being left behind, it appeared as if it
had been carried by a &s;wift Motion of its own from Ea&s;t to We&s;t. And by rea|&s;on,
I &s;uppo&s;e, that even that part of the Atmo&s;phere was moved a little to|wards
the Ea&s;t, thence was the Appearance of the Tail or Blaze it had that way,
of about 3 times its own Diameter: Which will, I conceive, give a probable
Cau&s;e of its apparent rapid Motion, and very well agree with the Hypothe&s; I
lately mentioned.</P>
<P>And the &s;ame <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> will &s;olve a like <HI>Phaenomenon,</HI> which, as well as I
can remember, was &s;ome 10 Years before ob&s;erved, both here in <HI>England,</HI> and
in <HI>Holland.</HI> It was &s;een by Sir <HI>Robert Murray,</HI> if I mi&s;remember not, and by
Mr. <HI>Shortgrave,</HI> and I think al&s;o by Mon&s;. <HI>Hugens</HI> in <HI>Holland.</HI> It was as big as
the <HI>Italian</HI> Meteor, and was judged to be of an exceeding great height in the
Atmo&s;phere, being &s;een at Places &s;o far di&s;tant at the &s;ame time. It appeared
fir&s;t about the North Ea&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ed by the North We&s;t, not ri&s;ing, as I remem|ber,
&s;o high as 10 Degrees above the Horizon. For &s;uppo&s;ing that in the &s;ame
manner to beleft behind by the &s;wiftly moving Parts of the Earth, the <HI>Phaeno|mena</HI>
will be very naturally &s;olved; and therefore de&s;erve, I conceive, to be
taken notice of in the Hi&s;tory of Nature.</P>

<HEAD>An Account of Dr. I&s;aac Vo&s;&s;ius's Hypothe&s;is of
GRAVITATION, with &s;ome Animadver|&s;ions
thereupon.</HEAD>
<P>HAving perus'd a Di&s;cour&s;e of the Learned Dr. <HI>Vo&s;&s;ius,</HI> wherein he endea|vours
to explain the true Rea&s;on and Cau&s;e of the <HI>Gravitation</HI> of Bo|dies
towards the Center of the Earth, I thought it might not be unacceptable
to give an account of my Thoughts concerning it, it being a Subject well worthy
the con&s;ideration of this Society, there having not been to this day any one
<HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> given by any Writer, that is &s;ufficient to &s;olve the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> thereof,
or to explain the Multitude of Effects produced by it, much le&s;s to demon|&s;trate
the Power and Limits thereof, concerning which I have heretofore &s;ome|what
more largely di&s;cour&s;ed in this A&s;&s;embly. I &s;hall not now &s;pend time in
the enumeration of the various <HI>Hypothe&s;es</HI> of &s;everal other Authors, but confine
my &s;elf only to the con&s;ideration of that which is propounded by this Worthy
and Ingenious Per&s;on. He conceives then, that the &s;ole rea&s;on why heavy Bo|dies
de&s;cend towards the Center of the Earth, and why light Bodies a&s;cend from
it, is the Diurnal Rotation, thereof upon its <HI>Axis,</HI> and wonders that it was ne|ver
found out before, even by tho&s;e who patronized the <HI>Copernican Pythagorick</HI>
(or, as he affirms, the <HI>Chaldean</HI> and <HI>Egyptian</HI> Opinion, long before <HI>Pythagoras)</HI>
of the Motion of the Earth. The Rea&s;ons he a&s;&s;igns, why this Motion mu&s;t
infallibly and nece&s;&s;arily produce this Effect, is becau&s;e heavy Bodies having an
inaptitude to Motion, do therefore endeavour towards the Center, where there
is none, or the lea&s;t that can be. This he explains by two &s;orts of Experiments
tried or ob&s;erved by him; the fir&s;t is that of a <HI>Vortex,</HI> or Whirl of Water in a
large Tub, the &s;econd that of a large Top. By the fir&s;t, he &s;ays, he found that
the Water being put into a &s;wift Circular Motion, all tho&s;e Bodies which were
heavy, and &s;unk to the bottom, were drawn to the middle, and the heavie&s;t of
them got neare&s;t to the Center, and tho&s;e le&s;s heavy were removed farther and
farther off, according to their proportionate Degree of Gravity, as Lead would get
neare&s;t, Iron next, then Stones, or other le&s;s heavy Bodies. On the other &s;ide,
&s;uch Bodies as were lighter than the Water, and &s;o &s;wam upon it, would
recede and fly off to the Sides of the Tub. The like <HI>Phaenomena</HI> he ob&s;erved
al&s;o in Whirlwinds of the Air. His &s;econd Experiment of the Top, he produces
to an&s;wer &s;ome Objections which are u&s;ually made again&s;t the Motion of the
Earth, and &s;o will con&s;equently be again&s;t this <HI>Hypothe&s;is:</HI> For 'tis u&s;ually, &s;ays
he, objected, that if the Earth move, then all &s;uch Bodies as are loo&s;e upon it,
would be &s;o far from growing more heavy towards the Center, that they would
all of them be rather thrown off into the Air or <HI>Aether</HI> with a great violence,
and tend outwards or upwards from it, &s;ince 'tis plain, that a Body put into a
Wheel, and turned &s;wiftly round, has a tendency from the Center, and not at
all to it. For, &s;aith he, tho' it be true, that a Wheel turned thus perpendicu|larly,
do's cau&s;e the heavy Body to recede; yet if the Wheel were moved Hori|zontally,
as a Top is, with its <HI>Axis</HI> erect, and at right Angles with the Plain
of the Horizon, it would not. But I conceive both the&s;e Arguments are <HI>gra$$$
dicta,</HI> as are all the Conclu&s;ions deduced therefrom, and the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> they ex|hibit
are to be a&s;cribed to quite different Cau&s;es to tho&s;e he a$$igns. For, fir&s;t, $word$
to Whirl-winds and <HI>Vortices,</HI> 'tis clear, that by the violent $span$ of
the Air or Water, the Endeavour of tho&s;e Bodies is to $$cede from the Center
of that Rotation, and by that means there is le&s;s Re&s;i&s;tance in the $word$ for
Bodies, whether heavy or light (for both will move towards it) to ge$ into it;
but the lighter much ea&s;ier than tho&s;e that are heavy, as 'tis common to &s;ee &s;mall
Whi$les of the Wind to gather together Leaves and Straw, and light Dull,
and rai&s;e them up into the Air; but Stones and heavier Bodies are not at all

along in the plain literal Sen&s;e, as indeed mo&s;t Readers have, and do as yet
conceive of it, as he, be&s;ides what he hath &s;aid in his Preface, doth more par|ticularly
&s;hew in his Contents of the &s;everal Sections of it, and his &s;everal Notes
di&s;per&s;ed here and there in &s;aid Book. But proceeding to peru&s;e the &s;aid
Di&s;cour&s;e, I upon the fir&s;t View and Con&s;ideration of the 3 Copper Sculptures
prefixed, immediately conjectured what the Subject of the Book was likely to
be, which by divers other Circum&s;tances afterwards I was more confirmed in,
as I &s;hall by and by &s;hew.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t, it may &s;eem needful that I premi&s;e &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e Apologetical for
my &s;elf,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, for peru&s;ing a Book &s;uppo&s;ed to be a Book of Conjuration, and dealing
with the Devil and his Imps.</P>
<P>Next, For di&s;cour&s;ing in this Place concerning a Book which has been publi&s;h|ed
&s;o many Years, and pa&s;t under the Cen&s;ure and Judgment of mo&s;t Learned
Men, and &s;o is at be&s;t but &s;tale, and what every body knows, or may have known
already.</P>
<P>3dly, That it contains a Di&s;cour&s;e of a Subject &s;o much be&s;ide the De&s;ign of
the In&s;titution of this Honourable Society; this &s;eeming to have nothing to do
with the Improving Natural Knowledge.</P>
<P>4thly, For that it &s;eems not to have relation to the Hi&s;tory of Nature or of
Art, and &s;o falls not within the Limitation of the Subject of this Lecture.</P>
<P>5thly, For my Pre&s;umption in interpo&s;ing my Conjectures and Sentiments
concerning the Subject Matter of the &s;ame, after it hath been cen&s;ured by &s;uch
Eminently Learned and Judicious Men, as Bp <HI>U&s;her,</HI> Dr. <HI>Ca&s;aubon,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, I found in the very Title Dr. <HI>Merick Ca&s;aubon's</HI> Opi|nion
&s;pecified to be, that the Relation, was real (as to the Point of Spirits) and
that a &s;ober Chri&s;tian might make &s;everal good U&s;es of all: And in the Preface
it &s;elf the Doctor hath very much inlarged upon this Subject, and &s;ays in the
fir&s;t Page of his Preface, that he was the more confirmed in his Sentiments con|cerning
it, when he was told at fir&s;t by tho&s;e that knew very well, that the mo&s;t
Reverend, Pious and Learned Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Armagh,</HI> then lately decea&s;ed,
upon reading the &s;aid Book before his Death, had declared him&s;elf to the &s;ame
purpo&s;e, and wi&s;hed, it printed. His fir&s;t U&s;e is for an Argument again&s;t Athei&s;ts,
and &s;uch as do not believe Spirits and Devils, 2dly, Again&s;t Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who
altogether depend upon new Revelations, zealou&s;ly and &s;ervently praying for
&s;uch In&s;pirations and extraordinary A&s;&s;i&s;tances, &s;aying, that this Bu&s;ine&s;s of
Prayer and Prai&s;ing is a Bu&s;ine&s;s, as of great Comfort, &s;o of much more Dan|ger
and Delu&s;ion than many do believe; upon which account he tells many
&s;trange Stories. 3dly, For to deter Men from pre&s;umptuous unlawful Wi&s;hes
and De&s;ires; and thence of making u&s;e of Witches, Conjurers, A&s;trologers,
and Fortunetellers, and all Books of tho&s;e Subjects, which he conceives were
the Cau&s;e of Dr. <HI>Dee's</HI> Delu&s;ion: So that I was &s;atisfied there could be no great
Danger or Harm in the looking farther into the Contents of it. But more than
this, I conceived it not rea&s;onable altogether to depend upon the Opinion and
Sentiment of others concerning it, when the Book was by, to give Te&s;timony of
it &s;elf; for that divers Books have been condemned for &s;uppo&s;ed Crimes, of
which yet, upon further Inquiry, they have been $ound innocent, and to have quite
a differing De&s;ign from what they &s;eemed at fir&s;t fight to intend. Witne&s;s the

the Art and Ingenuity of the Book, as above all other, <HI>Gu&s;trous Selenses,</HI> or

&s;o he proceeds to &s;hew the Rea&s;on, why he calls &s;ome of tho&s;e Spirits Dukes
or Princes, others Captains, others mini&s;tring and &s;ub&s;ervient, and in &s;hort,
detects the whole Arti&s;ice of the whole Book, which had nothing of that De|&s;ign
for which the illiterate and unskilful Readers did generally condemn it.</P>
<P>But &s;econdly, As to the Stalene&s;s of the Book, it having been now printed
and publi&s;hed about 32 Years, I an&s;wer, that as to my &s;elf, tho' I had often &s;een
the Book, and heard many Di&s;cour&s;es of it, and of its Contents, yet as to my
own knowledge of it, it was perfectly new, and po&s;&s;ibly it may be &s;o to a great
many others, con&s;idering the Subject of the &s;ame, and the manner of the Deli|very
thereof, which indeed &s;eems to be (bating &s;ome Parts that relate to a
kind of Hi&s;tory of <HI>Dee</HI>'s particular Affairs and Tran&s;actions with &s;ome Great
Men) a Rap&s;ody of incoherent and unintelligible Whimfies of Prayers and
Prai&s;es, Invocations and Apparitions of Spirits, &s;trange Characters, uncouth
and unintelligible Names, Words and Sentences, and Relations of incredible
Occurrences. So that wherever you open and begin to read, you may find cau&s;e
enough in a very little time to throw it a&s;ide and neglect it, till you have
quite forgotten what you then met with, as it happen'd to me, who had in that
manner &s;everal times &s;een and read here and there a few Paragraphs.</P>
<P>But next I an&s;wer, that there are many Books that have been a long time
printed; nay &s;ome &s;o long, that they are many of them almo&s;t quite lo&s;t, and
very hardly and rarely to be met with, which yet de&s;erve to be looked into,
and an account given of, as much as many new Books, which now almo&s;t every
Day are brought forth into the World, upon which Subject I need not inlarge,
becau&s;e I believe I may have many others of the &s;ame Opinion: For there are
many things which are now produced foe Novelties and new Di&s;coveries, which
yet may be found to have been long &s;ince publi&s;hed, and either have not been
taken notice of, or through Length of time have been forgotten and lo&s;t, as if
they bad never been. Again, there are many Books, that have &s;lipt into the
World at &s;uch times, as no body, or very few, at lea&s;t, have taken notice of
them upon their fir&s;t coming, by rea&s;on they were of Subjects then not much
regarded, or in vogue, or when Mens Minds were taken up or more concerned
for other Subjects, or Matters of greater import, which by the Time of the
Printing might po&s;&s;ibly be the Fate of this very Book, which probably at ano|ther
time would have made more Noi&s;e, and, it may be, have met with more
Notice, if not al&s;o more Oppo&s;ition. And it has been the Fate of many good
Books to be neglected for &s;ome time after their fir&s;t Publication, which yet in
time come to be better look'd into, and the U&s;efulne&s;s of them under&s;tood,
and then to begin to be prized, as I under&s;tand was the Fate of Mr. <HI>Purchas</HI> his
Pilgrims and Pilgrimage, and &s;everal others.</P>
<P>As to the 3d Objection that may &s;eem to need an Apology, namely, the <HI>He|te$ogenity</HI>
and Unfitne&s;s of the Subject for the Con&s;ideration of this Society, as
being reputed a Treati&s;e about Supernatural Effects or Productions, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s,
that if it be to be under&s;tood according to the plain literal Meaning, it
would be truly &s;o; but whereas I conceive the true Meaning and De&s;ign of the
who$e to be quite another Matter, I think it may be as properly referred to the
Improvement of Natural Knowledge to under&s;tand it, as of any other Book that
has plainly and expre&s;ly treated of the Hi&s;tory of Nature and Art. For I take
it to be a concealed Hi&s;tory of that kind, which may al&s;o apologize for my
treating of it upon this occa&s;ion in this Lecture.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o &s;erve for my 5th Apology: For tho' I confe&s;s it may &s;eem to fa|vour
of too much Confidence, to differ from the Sentiments of mo&s;t Men con|cerning
it; yet &s;ince what I propound is not po&s;itive, but rather as Queries to

be re&s;olved by &s;uch as have better Abilities and Opportunities to &s;olve them

in Verba:</HI> For whatever may &s;eem rational to others to judge of the &s;aid Book,
to me, I confe&s;s, it &s;eems to be de&s;igned to comprehend another Meaning than
what is plainly legible in the Words of it, which po&s;&s;ibly many others that
have read it, may have no Su&s;picion of; neither may they have ever &s;een or
con&s;idered the Cryptography of <HI>Trithemius,</HI> or any other Author on the like
Subjects. <HI>Non omnia po&s;&s;umus omnes.</HI> Thus much by way of Apology.</P>
<P>To come then to the Book it &s;elf. Upon turning it over, and comparing &s;e|veral
Particulars in it one with another, and with other Writings of the &s;aid
Dr. <HI>Dee,</HI> and con&s;idering al&s;o the Hi&s;tory of the Life, Actions and E&s;tate of the
&s;aid Author, &s;o far as I can be informed, I do conceive that the greate&s;t part of
the &s;aid Books e&s;pecially all that which relates to the Spirits and Apparitions,
together with their Names, Speeches, Shews, Noi&s;es, Clothing, Actions, and
the Prayers and Doxologies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are all <HI>Cryptography;</HI> and that &s;ome Parts
al&s;o of that which &s;eems to be a Journal of his Voyage and Travels into &s;everal
Parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> are al&s;o <HI>Cryptographical;</HI> that is, that under tho&s;e feigned
Stories, which he there &s;eems to relate as Matters of Fact, he hath concealed
Relations of quite another thing; and that he made u&s;e of this way of ab&s;conding
it, that he might the more &s;ecurely e&s;cape di&s;covery, if he &s;hould fall under &s;u&s;pi|tion
as to the true De&s;igns of his Travels, or that the &s;ame &s;hould fall into the
hands of any Spies, or &s;uch as might be imployed to betray him or his Intentions;
conceiving the Inqui&s;ition that &s;hould be made, or Pro&s;ecution, if di&s;covered,
would be more gentle for a Pretended Enthu&s;ia&s;t, than for a real Spy.</P>
<P>What his De&s;igns or Bu&s;ine&s;s with the Emperor, the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and
others, was, is hard to determine, <HI>i. e.</HI> fir&s;t whether he were &s;ent upon &s;ome
private Me&s;&s;age by the Queen, or any of the then Mini&s;ters of State, to inquire
into and di&s;cover the &s;ecret De&s;igns or Actions of that Court, is hard now to
determine; but 'tis likely. For in his Apology he alledges, that the Lord Trea|&s;urer
had by the Queen's Order written to the Arch Bi&s;hop, to &s;ignify that he
went beyond Sea by her good Favour and Licen&s;e; and we find al&s;o that the
Queen did &s;end &s;everal Letters and Me&s;&s;engers to call him home, and that upon
his Return the Queen received him kindly at <HI>Richmond,</HI> and that &s;he u&s;ed to
call at his Hou&s;e at <HI>Mortlack,</HI> and &s;hewed her&s;elf courteous to him upon all
occa&s;ions, and again&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> 1590, &s;ent him 200 Angels to keep his <HI>Chri&s;t|mas,</HI>
and 100 Mark for the &s;ame purpo&s;e <HI>1592.</HI> We find al&s;o, that in his Re|turn
for <HI>England,</HI> he pre&s;ented the Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> with 12 <HI>Hungarian</HI> Hor|&s;es;
which &s;eems too much for any Man in a private Capacity. And when he
returned, he left <HI>Kelly</HI> with the Emperor, who for &s;everal Years after kept Cor|re&s;pondence
with Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> here, which might po&s;&s;ibly continue to execute the
&s;ame De&s;ign; <HI>Kelly</HI> being now grown Sir <HI>Edward Kelly,</HI> and the Emperor's Chy|mi&s;t.
And in probability Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> might have &s;ufficiently furni&s;hed him with
<HI>Cryptography</HI> enough to &s;end what Intelligences he plea&s;ed, without &s;u&s;pition,
which was ea&s;ily conceived under any other feigned Story. I will not deter|mine
whether this were his Bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;ay, or whether it might not be upon his
own account, to &s;ee if he could make a Fortune under the Emperor by means of
Chymi&s;try, or Mathematicks, or A&s;trology, or Mechanicks, all which I find
by his Writings he was well ver&s;ed in, and e&s;pecially in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Opticks,
and Per&s;pective and Mechanick Contrivances; an effect of which I conceive his
Chry&s;tal, or Angelical Stone, or <HI>Chry&s;tallum Sacratum,</HI> as he terms it, to have
been, for that it was of a con&s;iderable bigne&s;s, and was placed upon a Pede&s;tal,
or Table, which he calls a Holy Table, which might contain the <HI>Apparatus</HI> to
make Apparitions, when he had a mind to be &s;een in it, as likewi&s;e to produce
Noi&s;es and Voices, if there were occa&s;ion. All which might be done by Art,
as has been &s;hewn, both formerly by <HI>Roger Bacon,</HI> and of late by the Echoing
Head. He likewi&s;e pretended to the Philo&s;ophers Stone and <HI>Elixir,</HI> for which
I take <HI>Kelly</HI> to be his Engine. I find al&s;o, that he affirms to have had 2 Ounces
of the <HI>Pouder of Projection,</HI> which, as Mr. <HI>A&s;hmole,</HI> in his Notes upon the
<HI>Theatrum Chymicum,</HI> publi&s;hed by him 1652, &s;ays, was &s;o rich in Virtue (being
<PB N="207" REF="244">
One upon 272330) that they at fir&s;t lo&s;t much by making Projections for
Trials, before they founds out the true height of the Medicine. He was like|wi&s;e
well ver&s;ed in <HI>Cabali&s;tical</HI> Learning and <HI>Cryptography,</HI> as appears by the
Title of a Treati&s;e written by him upon that Subject, and by that Book which
he &s;eems to have prized &s;o much, and calls the Book of <HI>Enoch,</HI> which I take
to be of no other u&s;e, than for <HI>Cryptography</HI> and <HI>Cabali&s;ms.</HI> I will not deter|mine,
I &s;ay, whether his De&s;ign might not be by the&s;e and &s;ome other &s;uch In|genuities
(as particularly a Gla&s;s, which he mentions, <HI>Pag.</HI> 256. (the Secret of
which he opened to Dr. <HI>Curtz</HI> the Emperor's Phy&s;ician) for <HI>Battering</HI> in a dark
Night, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which what he means by it I under&s;tand not; but Dr. <HI>Curtz</HI> told
him that Conclu&s;ion would be very acceptable to the Emperor. He had al&s;o
written Six Books <HI>deSpeculis Comburentibus,</HI> Two Books of the <HI>A&s;tronomical Ring;</HI>
or <HI>Ring Dial,</HI> and two Books al&s;o of <HI>Clockwork</HI>) to find Entertainment and Encou|ragement
from the Emperor. But I do rather conjecture, that he was employed by
Queen for &s;ome private Affair of State, and that he made u&s;e of the&s;e his In|ventions,
in order to obtain the freer and more un&s;u&s;pected Acce&s;s to the Empe|ror;
which having not &s;ucceeded as might have been expected, he was recalled,
and returned into <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Nov.</HI> 1589. That a great part of this Treati&s;e is <HI>Cryp|tography,</HI>
I conceive is very probable from the&s;e and divers other Con&s;iderations:
Fir&s;t, for that he took &s;uch care to pre&s;erve the Book of <HI>Enoch,</HI> which I con|jecture
to contain the Methods and Keys of what was concealed in this Book.
Next, for that the Method and Manner thereof is &s;o like to that of <HI>Trithemius</HI>
his <HI>Cryptography,</HI> that I conceive (were it worth while) it would not be difficult
to decipher a great part of it, by analogy thereunto. Now tho' at that time
the Key or Method of that Book were not &s;o well and commonly known, yet
I do not doubt but this inqui&s;itive Man had got Knowledge of it in his Travels
and Enquiries in <HI>Germany,</HI> po&s;&s;ibly when he pre&s;ented his <HI>Monas Hieroglyphica</HI>
to the Emperor <HI>Maximilian</HI> 1564; and po&s;&s;ibly it might be upon the &s;ame ac|count,
that he made choice of this way of Invocations and Revelations to con|ceal
his Meaning, that I &s;hewed before <HI>Trithemius</HI> had done in his. <HI>Trithemius</HI>
al&s;o pretended to Revelation, as may be &s;een in the Hi&s;tory of his Life, tho'
not &s;o frequent as this Author has done in this Book, at lea&s;t if the Sen&s;e thereof
be under&s;tood literally; but that I conceive to be nothing but the outward Form,
Appearance or Dre&s;s of the Sub&s;tance and Subject of the Book, which lay ab&s;con|ded
from common Di&s;covery under that Mask or Di&s;gui&s;e; tho' yet I am apt to
believe he had &s;ome artificial Contrivances to perform this al&s;o, when he &s;aw cau&s;e.
Thirdly, for that there are very many plain In&s;tances of <HI>Cryptography,</HI> both by
changing and putting &s;ome Letters for others, and Numbers for Letters, and Num|bers
al&s;o for Words, and Tables for di&s;po&s;ing or placing Letters according to &s;e|veral
Orders and Methods, to be &s;een in the Book it &s;elf: And the Book which
he calls the Book of <HI>Enoch,</HI> &s;eems to be nothing el&s;e. Be&s;ides, the Words that
he &s;ets down, as delivered by his Spirits, are many of them inarticulate, accord|ing
to the commonly accepted Sounds or Pronunciation of tho&s;e Characters they
are written with, and therefore were not put to &s;ignify tho&s;e Letters. It would
be too long to give In&s;tances out of the Book it &s;elf of the&s;e Particulars, and
'tis needle&s;s, &s;ince they, are &s;o very many and frequent in every part of the Book.
He hath likewi&s;e divers Polygonal Figures, as I conceive, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e,
and many other &s;uch indications of <HI>Cryptography.</HI></P>
<P>And to conclude for the pre&s;ent, any one that does without prejudice peru&s;e
the <HI>Libri My&s;tici Apertorii Cracovien&s;is Sabbatici,</HI> pag. 115. will &s;ee a hundred
Arguments to convince him of the Probability, if not Certainty of this my Con|jecture:
And &s;ome other time I &s;hall give: &s;ome other Arguments, which may
po&s;&s;ibly give fuller Satisfaction. But I would not detain too long upon this Subject.</P>

<P>All which, and many more in &s;everal kinds of Learning, as Hi&s;tory, Heral|dry,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> written by him before the Year 1583. Some time he be&s;towed in Vul|gar
<HI>Chymi&s;try,</HI> and was therein Ma&s;ter of divers Secrets; among&s;t others he
(<HI>Dec.</HI> 28. 1519.) revealed to one <HI>Roger Cook,</HI> the great Secret of the <HI>Elixir</HI> (as
he called it) of the Salt of Metals, the Projection whereof was one upon a
hundred. His great Ability in <HI>A&s;trology,</HI> and the more &s;ecret Parts of Learning
(to which he had a &s;trong Propen&s;ity and unwearied Phan&s;y) drew from the En|vious

and ju&s;tifiable Philo&s;ophical Studies, and many times forced him, out of the
Bitterne&s;s of his Soul (which was even crucified with the Malice of impudent
Tongues) mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;ervently to apologize: Nor could he enjoy Tran|quality
in his Studies, but was oft di&s;quieted and vexed with the &s;ower Di&s;po|litions
of &s;uch as &s;candalized mo&s;t injuriou&s;ly both him and them: In&s;omuch
that (1581) the Year he went beyond Sea, his Library was &s;eized on, wherein
were 4000 Books, 700 of them Manu&s;cripts. (<HI>A Caveat for all Ingenious and
Eminent Philo&s;ophers to be more wi&s;e than to keep any dear or excellent Books in

might fall into &s;ome Hands that would never &s;ince &s;uffer it to &s;ee Light;
which might occa&s;ion the Learned <HI>Selden</HI> to &s;ay [in the Preface to <HI>Hopton's Con|cordance</HI>]

<P>The&s;e kind of Per&s;ections were &s;till multiplied upon him, and he &s;ometimes
per&s;onally aggrieved by them: For about the Year 1594, he was under &s;ome
Re&s;traint, which occa&s;ioned him to write to the Lady <HI>Scudamore</HI> [<HI>Oct.</HI> 28. 1594.]

Council, or el&s;e under the Broad Seal have Liberty to go freely where he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>&mdash;'Tis generally reported, that Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> and Sir <HI>Edward Kelly</HI> were &s;o
&s;trangely fortunate, as to find a very large Quantity of the <HI>Elixir</HI> in &s;ome Parts
of the Ruins of <HI>Gla&s;tenbury</HI> Abby, which was &s;o incredibly rich in Virtue (be|ing

<PB N="201" REF="246">
were they Ma&s;ters of this Trea&s;ure, then they re&s;olved to travel into foreign
Parts, when falling into acquaintance with one <HI>Albertus Lasky,</HI> a <HI>Polonian</HI>
Prince, which came into <HI>England</HI> in the beginning of <HI>May</HI> 1583, on the 21&s;t of
<HI>September</HI> following, they, their Wives, Children and Families, went beyond
Sea with the &s;aid Prince. And whether they found it at <HI>Gla&s;tenbury,</HI> as is afore|&s;aid,
or however el&s;e they came by it, 'tis certain they had it: For at <HI>Trebona</HI>
in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> whither they were come to dwell [<HI>Sept.</HI> 4. 1586.] Sir <HI>Edward Kelly</HI>
made Projection with one &s;mall Grain thereof [<HI>Dec.</HI> 9. 1586.] in proportion
no bigger than the lea&s;t Grain of Sand, upon one Ounce and a quarter of com|mon
<HI>Mercury,</HI> and it produced almo&s;t an Ounce of mo&s;t pure Gold. This was
done to gratify Mr. <HI>Edward Garland</HI> and his Brother <HI>Francis,</HI> and in their Pre|&s;ence;
which <HI>Edward</HI> was lately come to <HI>Trebona,</HI> being &s;ent thither to Dr. <HI>Dee</HI>
from the Emperor of <HI>Mo&s;covia,</HI> according to &s;ome Articles before brought by
one <HI>Thomas Symkin&s;on.</HI> I al&s;o find this Note of Dr. <HI>Dee</HI>'s, <HI>Jan,</HI> 9. 1586. <HI>Donum
Dei</HI> 2 Ounces, <HI>E. K.</HI> Moreover, nearer the later <HI>Te&s;timony,</HI> I have received
it from a credible Per&s;on, that one <HI>Broomfield</HI> and <HI>Alexander Roberts</HI> told him,
they had often &s;een Sir <HI>Edward Kelly</HI> make Projection, and in particular upon a
Piece of Metal cut out of a Warming-pan, and without Sir <HI>Edward's</HI> touching
or handling it, or melting the Metal, only warming it in the Fire, the <HI>Elixir</HI> be|ing
put thereon, it was tran&s;muted into pure Silver. The Warming pan, and
this Piece of it, was &s;ent to Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> by her Amba&s;&s;ador, who then lay
at <HI>Prague,</HI> that by fitting the Piece into the Place from whence it was cut out, it
might exactly appear to be once part of that Warming pan. The afore&s;aid Per&s;on
hath likewi&s;e &s;een in the hands of one Mr. <HI>Frye</HI> and <HI>Scroop,</HI> Rings of Sir <HI>Edward
Kelly</HI>'s Gold, the Fa&s;hion of which was only Gold Wire twi&s;ted thrice about the
Finger; and of the&s;e fa&s;hioned Rings he gave away to the value of 4000 <HI>l.</HI> at
the Marriage of one of his Servant-Maids. This was highly generous; but to
&s;ay truth, he was openly, profu&s;e beyond the mode&s;t Limits of a &s;ober Philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>During their abode at <HI>Trebona</HI> they try'd many Chymical Experiments, to &s;ee
whether they could make that Jewel they po&s;&s;e&s;t; (The particular Account of
their Operations I need not here relate.) yet I cannot hear that ever they ac|compli&s;ht
any thing: Only I find the 27th of <HI>April</HI> noted by Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> with &s;e|veral
Expre&s;&s;ions of Joy and Gladne&s;s, as, <HI>Haec e&s;t Dies quam &s;ecit Dominus:</HI>
Again, <HI>Mi&s;ericordia Dei Magna;</HI> and la&s;tly, <HI>Omne, quod vivit, laudet Dominum.</HI>
And to te&s;tify what they meant, he writes upon the 30th Day following, <HI>Mr.</HI> Ed|ward
Kelly <HI>did open the Great Secret to me, God be thanked.</HI> While they lived
at <HI>Trebona,</HI> Sir <HI>Edward Kelly</HI> went divers times to <HI>Prague,</HI> and the 15th of <HI>Jan.</HI>
1587, he went into <HI>Poland,</HI> but returned the 9th of <HI>February</HI> after. And 'tis
probable the&s;e Journies were made in que&s;t after &s;ome famous Chymi&s;ts. Things
were not carried here &s;o privately, but Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had notice given her of
their Actions; whereupon &s;he u&s;ed &s;everal means by Letters and Me&s;&s;ages to in|vite
them back into <HI>England,</HI> where it was believed &s;he had &s;o far prevailed, that
Mr. <HI>Symkin&s;on</HI> and Mr. <HI>Francis Garland</HI>'s Brother <HI>Robert</HI> coming from <HI>England</HI> to
<HI>Trebona</HI> [<HI>Dec.</HI> 8. 1587.] &s;uppo&s;ed they had been ready to come over to <HI>England</HI>
upon the Queen's Letters formerly &s;ent them. And tho' Sir <HI>Edward Kelly</HI> &s;taid
behind, yet Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> left <HI>Trebona</HI> [<HI>May</HI> 1. 1589.] and came for <HI>England.</HI> But
whether occa&s;ioned by &s;ome Unkindne&s;s received from Sir <HI>Edw. Kelly,</HI> or falling
out of their Wives, or Sollicitation of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> or all of the&s;e concur|ring,
I am not yet certain. Not unlike but each of the&s;e might contribute to
their Separation. For that there was &s;ome great and wonderful Unkindne&s;s pa&s;t
from Sir <HI>Edward Kelly,</HI> appears by his &s;ending for Dr. <HI>Dee,</HI> the beginning of
<HI>Jan.</HI> 1588, under &s;hew of Reconciliation, and di&s;covering more than ordinary In|timacy
and Complacency about that time; which fair Shews the Good Doctor
notes with the&s;e Prayers, <HI>God lead his Heart to all Charity and Brotherly Love.</HI>
As al&s;o Letters &s;ent by Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> to Sir <HI>Edward Kelly</HI> and his Wife the end of <HI>March</HI>
following, requiring at their hands mutual Charity; which [<HI>May</HI> 9.] after, upon
Mrs. <HI>Kelly</HI>'s receiving the Sacrament, &s;he gave her Hand to Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> and his Wife
in token of Charity. But it &s;eems things were not cordial, but only outward: For
the 6th of <HI>September</HI> following, the Lord Chancellor coming to <HI>Trebona,</HI> the Ran|cour
and Di&s;&s;imulation was more evident to him, and it &s;eems grew up to a great|er
height than he could bear. And thereupon he thought wi&s;ely to avoid the
<PB N="209" REF="247">
further Danger by leaving <HI>Germany,</HI> which occa&s;ioned him [<HI>Jan.</HI> 4. 1589.] to
deliver to Sir <HI>Edward Kelly</HI> the Powder, the Books, the Gla&s;s, with &s;ome other
things, and thereupon received his Di&s;charge in Writing under his Hand and Seal.
While the&s;e Di&s;contents continued, &s;everal Letters pa&s;t between Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>
and Dr. <HI>Dee,</HI> whereby perhaps he might promi&s;e to return. At length it &s;o fell
out, that he [<HI>March</HI> 1. 1589.] left <HI>Trebona,</HI> and took his Journy for <HI>England.</HI>
The 9th of <HI>April</HI> he came to <HI>Breame,</HI> and had not &s;taid there 3 Days, but the
Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;e</HI> &s;ent Letters of civil Complements to him, and within 3 Days
after Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> pre&s;ented him with his 12 <HI>Hungarian</HI> Hor&s;es, that he bought at <HI>Pra|gue</HI>
for his Journy. Here (<HI>June</HI> 27. 1589.) the Famous <HI>Hermetick</HI> Philo&s;opher,
Dr. <HI>Henric Kunrath</HI> of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> came to vi&s;it him. The 16th of <HI>Novemb.</HI> he
went thence to <HI>Stade,</HI> where he met with Mr. <HI>Edward Dyer</HI> going Emba&s;&s;ador for
<HI>Denmark,</HI> who the Year before had been at <HI>Trebona,</HI> and carried back Letters
from the Doctor to Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> He was a great Corre&s;pondent of Dr. <HI>Dee</HI>'s,
and as earne&s;t a Searcher after the Stone. The 23d of <HI>Nov.</HI> following he arriv'd
at <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> having been out of <HI>England</HI> 6 Years, 2 Months, and 2 Days; and
the 9th of <HI>Dec.</HI> pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the Queen at <HI>Richmond,</HI> where he was fa|voured
with a kind Reception.</P>
<P>Being &s;ettled again at <HI>Mortlack,</HI> the Queen u&s;ed to call at his Hou&s;e to vi&s;it
him, and &s;hewed her &s;elf very courteous to him upon all occa&s;ions. Again&s;t
<HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> 1590, &s;he &s;ent him 200 Angels wherewith to keep his <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> and
100 Marks again&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> 1592. She likewi&s;e &s;ent him word by Mr. <HI>Thomas
Candi&s;h,</HI> to do what he would in Alchymy and Philo&s;ophy, and none &s;hould con|troul
or mole&s;t him: And not unlike, by the Queen's Example, divers Per&s;ona|ges
of Honour at Court frequented his Company, and &s;ent him many Gifts from
time to time; among&s;t others Sir <HI>Tho. Jones</HI> mo&s;t nobly offer'd him his Ca&s;tle of
<HI>Emlin</HI> in <HI>Wales</HI> to dwell in free with all Accommodations.</P>
<P>His Favour was fair at Court, the Queen her &s;elf bad him find out &s;omething
for her to be&s;tow; yet all the Preferment he gained was (<HI>Dec.</HI> 8. 1594.) the
Grant of the <HI>Chancellorship</HI> of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s; and the 27th of <HI>May</HI> 1595, his Patent
pa&s;t the Great Seal for the <HI>Warden&s;hip</HI> of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> whither he, his Wife,
Children and Family came the 14th of <HI>Feb.</HI> 1596. and the 20th Day following
was in&s;talled, and in this Warden&s;hip, (wherein he had the Unhappine&s;s to be
often vext with the turbulent Fellows of that College) died, de&s;erving the Com|mendation
of all Learned and Ingenious Scholars, and to be remembred for his
remarkable Abilities.</P>
<P>After Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> came to <HI>England,</HI> as is before remembred, Corre&s;pondence was
&s;till maintained between him and Sir <HI>Edward Kelly,</HI> in Letters &s;ent by Mr. <HI>Fran|cis
Garland</HI> and others (and &s;ome Expectancy of Sir <HI>Edward</HI>'s, coming over
(<HI>Dec.</HI> 23. 1589.) Mr. <HI>Thomas Kelly</HI> his Brother putting the Doctor in hopes there|of
likewi&s;e.) But at length Sir <HI>Edward</HI> was clapt up clo&s;e Pri&s;oner by the Em|peror
(for he had &s;o unwarily and openly managed the Secret, that it had given
the Emperor occa&s;ion to carry a &s;trict eye over all his Actions, out of a de&s;ire to
be Sharer with him in his good Fortune) yet it &s;eems the Emperor &s;et him at
Liberty (<HI>Nov.</HI> 4. 1593.) and Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> had notice of it the 5th of <HI>December</HI> after.
And tho' he began to grow into the Emperor's Favour, in hopes to be entertained
into his Service (for &s;o he certify'd Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> by Letters in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1595.) never|thele&s;s
he was clapt up again into Pri&s;on, and attempting to make his E&s;cape out
of a high Window, by the tearing of his Sheets, which were ty'd together to
let him down, he being a weighty Man, fell and broke his Leg, and thereof
died. This is one Report of his Death. Others there are, but Dr. <HI>Dee</HI> men|tions
none at all, of the manner thereof, only this: <HI>Nov.</HI> 25. 1595. <HI>News that

<HEAD>A Di&s;cour&s;e of Earthquakes.</HEAD>
<P>I Have formerly endeavour'd to explain &s;everal Ob&s;ervations I had made
concerning the Figure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Introducti|on to the fol|lowing Di&s;|cour&s;e, giving &s;ome account of its De&s;ign.</NOTE>
Form, Po&s;ition, Di&s;tance, Order, Motions
and Operations of the Cele&s;tial Bodies, both as to them&s;elves, and one
with another, and likewi&s;e with re&s;pect to the Body of the <HI>Earth</HI> on which
we inhabit. But conceiving it may more nearly concern us to know more
particularly the Con&s;titution; Figure, Magnitude and Properties of the Bo|dy
of the <HI>Earth</HI> it&s;elf, and of its &s;everal con&s;tituent Parts, I have endea|vour'd
to collect &s;uch Ob&s;ervations and Natural Hi&s;tories of others, as may
&s;erve to give &s;ome Light toward the making a compleat Di&s;covery of them,
&s;o far as the Power, Faculties, Organs, and other helps that Nature has
furni&s;h'd Man with$ may a&s;&s;i&s;t us in performing and perfecting thereof.</P>
<P>The Subject is large, as extending as far as the whole Bulk included within
the utmo&s;t limits of the Atmo&s;phere: And 'tis not le&s;s copious and repleat with
variety, as containing all the &s;everal Parts and Sub&s;tances included within
tho&s;e Limits, namely, The aerial, watery and earthy Parts thereof, whether
Superficial or Subterraneous, whether Expo&s;ed or Ab&s;conded, whether Supra|terraneal,
Superterraneal, or Subterraneal, whether Elemental or Organical,
Animate or Inanimate, and all the Species and Kinds of them, and all the con|&s;tituent
Parts of them, and the Compo&s;its con&s;tituted of them; of which al|&s;o
there will fall under Con&s;ideration, the Artificial as well as the Natural
Cau&s;es and Powers effective of things; then their Generation, Production,
Augmentation, Perfection, Vertue, Power, Activity, Operation, Effect,
Con&s;ervation, Duration, Declination, De&s;truction, Corruption, Transfor|mation,
and in one word, the motion or progre&s;&s;ion of Nature &s;en&s;ibly ex|pre&s;t,
or any other ways di&s;cernable in each of tho&s;e Species. Which Sub|ject,
if we con&s;ider as it is thus repre&s;ented, doth look very like an Im|po&s;&s;ibility
to be undertaken even by the whole World, to be gone through
within an Age, much le&s;s to be undertaken by any particular Society,
or a &s;mall number of Men. The number of Natural Hi&s;tories, Ob&s;ervati,
ons, Experiments, Calculations, Compari&s;ons, Deductions and Demonstra|tions
nece&s;&s;ary thereunto, &s;eeming to be incomprehen&s;ive and numberle&s;s:
And therefore a vain Attempt, and not to be thought of till after &s;ome
Ages pa&s;t in making Collections of Materials for &s;o great a Building, and
the employing a va&s;t number of Hands in making this Preparation; and
tho&s;e of &s;everal &s;orts, &s;uch as Readers of Hi&s;tory, Criticks, Rangers and
Name&s;etters of Things, Ob&s;ervers and Watchers of &s;everal Appearances, and
Progre&s;&s;ions of Natural Operations and Perfections, Collectors of curious
Productions, Experimenters and Examiners of Things by &s;everal Means and
&s;everal Methods and In&s;truments, as by Fire, by Fro&s;t, by Men&s;truums,
by Mixtures, by Dige&s;tions, Putrefactions, Fermentations and Petrifactions,

Dilating and Expanding, Di&s;&s;ecting, Separating and Dividing, Sifting
And Streining; by viewing with Gla&s;&s;es and Micro&s;copes, Smelling, Ta&s;t|ing,
Feeling, and various other ways of Torturing and Wracking of
Natural Bodies, to find out the Truth or the real Effect as it is in its Con|&s;titution
or State of Being.</P>
<P>To the&s;e may be added Regi&s;ters or Compilers, &s;uch as &s;hall Record and Ex|pre&s;s

and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="251">
So that we &s;ee the Subject of this Enquiry is very copious and large, and
will afford Work enough for every Well-willer to employ his Head and Hands,
to contribute towards the providing Materials for &s;o large a Fabrick and
Structure, as the great quantity of Materials to be collected do &s;eem to de|note.
However, 'tis po&s;&s;ible that a much le&s;s number may &s;erve the turn,
if fitly qualified and done with Method and De&s;ign, and it may be much better
and ea&s;ier.</P>
<P>When this mighty Collection is made, what will be the u&s;e of &s;o great a
Pile? Where will be found the Architect that &s;hall contrive and rai&s;e the
Super&s;tructure that is to be made of them, that &s;hall fit every one for its pro|per
u&s;e? Till which be found, they will indeed be but a heap of Confu&s;ion.
Who &s;hall find out the Experiments, the Ob&s;ervations, and other Remarks,
fit for this or that Theory? One Stone is too thick, or too thin, too broad,
or too narrow, not of a due colour, or hardne&s;s, or grain, to &s;uit with the
De&s;ign, or with &s;ome other that are duly &s;capled for the purpo&s;e: This Piece
of Timber is not of a right Kind, not of a &s;ufficient Drine&s;s and Sea&s;oning,
not of a due length and bigne&s;s, but wants its Scantlings, or is of an ill
Shape for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, or was not fell'd in a due time: 'Tis Sap-rotten,
or Wind-&s;haken, or rotten at Heart, or too frow, and the like, for the pur|po&s;e
for which 'tis wanted.</P>
<P>I mention this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The U&s;e of pre|de&s;ign'd Theo|ries, and Mo|dules of En|quiry.</NOTE> to hint only by the by, that there may be u&s;e, of Method
in the collecting of Materials, as well as in the u&s;e of them, and to &s;hew
that there may be made a Provi&s;ion too great, as well as too little, that
there ought to be &s;ome End and Aim, &s;ome pre-de&s;ign'd Module and The|ory,
&s;ome Purpo&s;e in our Experiments, and more particular ob&s;erving of
&s;uch Circum&s;tances as are proper for that De&s;ign. And though this Ho|nourable
Society have hitherto &s;eem'd to avoid and prohibit pre-conceived
Theories and Deductions from particular, and &s;eemingly accidental Experi|ments;
yet I humbly conceive, that &s;uch, if knowingly, and judiciou&s;ly made,
are Matters of the greate&s;t Importance, as giving a Characteri&s;tick of the
Aim, U&s;e, and Significancy thereof; and without which, many, and po&s;&s;i|bly
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Particulars, are pa&s;&s;ed over without Regard and
Ob&s;ervation. The mo&s;t part of Mankind are taken with the Prettine&s;s or
the Strangene&s;s of the Phaenomena, and generally neglect the common and
the mo&s;t obvious; whereas in truth, for the mo&s;t part, they are the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable. And the greate&s;t part of the Productions of Nature are to be
&s;een every where, and by every one, though, for the mo&s;t part, not heeded
or regarded, becau&s;e they are &s;o common. I could wi&s;h therefore that the
Information of Experiments might be more re&s;pected, than either the No|velty,
the Surprizingne&s;s, the Pomp, and Appearances of them.</P>
<P>The obviou&s;ne&s;s and ea&s;ine&s;s of knowing many Things in Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">of figured Stones.</NOTE> has
been the Cau&s;e of their being neglected, even by the more diligent and cu|rious;
which neverthele&s;s, if well examined, do very often contain Informa|tions
of the greate&s;t value. It has been generally noted by common, as well
as inqui&s;itive, Per&s;ons, that divers Stones have been found, formed into the
Shapes of Fi&s;hes, Shells, Fruits, Leaves, Wood, Barks, and other Vegeta|ble
and Animal Sub&s;tances: We commonly know &s;ome of them exactly re|&s;embling
the Shape of Things we commonly find (as the Chymi&s;ts &s;peak) in
the Vegetable or Animal Kingdom; others of them indeed bearing &s;ome
kind of Similitude, and agreeing in many Circum&s;tances, but yet not exactly
figured like any other thing in Nature; and yet of &s;o curious a Shape, that
they ea&s;ily rai&s;e both the Attention and Wonder, even of tho&s;e that are le&s;s
inqui&s;itive. Of the&s;e beautifully &s;haped Bodies I have ob&s;erved two &s;orts:
Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">of Chry&s;tals, and the like Stones, &s;hot into Figures.</NOTE> &s;ome more properly natural, &s;uch as have their Figures peculiar to
their Sub&s;tances: Others more improperly &s;o, that is, &s;uch as &s;eem to receive
their Shape from an external and accidental Mould.</P>
<P>Of the fir&s;t &s;ort, are all tho&s;e curiou&s;ly figured Bodies of Salts, Talks,
Spars, Cry&s;tals, Diamonds, Rubies, Amethy&s;ts, Ores, and divers other Mi|neral
Sub&s;tances, wherewith the World is adorned and enriched; which
I
at pre&s;ent omit to de&s;cribe, as re&s;erving them for a Second Part, they &s;eem|ing
to be, as it were, the Elemental Figures, or the <HI>ABC</HI> of Nature's

them) is very ea&s;ily explicable Mechanically: And &s;hall proceed to the &s;econd

<P>Of the&s;e are two kinds;<NOTE PLACE="marg">of Petri&s;a|ctions.</NOTE> either fir&s;t the very Sub&s;tances them&s;elves conver|ted

Mineral or Earthy Sub&s;tances, as Clays, Sands, Earths, Flinty Jui|ces,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> which have filled up, and been moulded in divers other Bodies, as
Shells, Bones, Fruits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but e&s;pecially Shells. The&s;e, according to the
Repre&s;entations they bear of other Bodies, have received divers Names; of
which <HI>Aldrovandus, Bauhinus, Imperatus, Wormius,</HI> and others, reckon a great
number: Such are, <HI>Cornu ammonis &s;ine armatura, Helicoides, Hoplites,
multiplex ob&s;cure lucens, muricatum, cri&s;tatum, cri&s;tatum pertu&s;um, &s;triatum Cam|poides,

<P><HI>AS to the figured Stones or Petrifactions here mention'd, I found only one Sheet
of the De&s;criptions of &s;everal of the</HI> Cornu-Ammonis <HI>&s;ort, with &s;ome of the</HI>
Echini, <HI>or Helmet-&s;tones, which De&s;criptions follow: As for the De&s;igns of them,
they were, I know not by what means, not to be found among&s;t his Manu&s;cripts; but
by the Favour of Dr.</HI> Sloane, <HI>into who&s;e Hands they happily fell, I procured them
for the Graver, to whom the World and my &s;elf are obliged for this, as well as for
other more valuable Communications. The Five fir&s;t Tables were de&s;ign'd by
Dr.</HI> Hook him&s;elf; <HI>and tho' he has not perfected the De&s;criptions of them all, yet
I have procured them all to be graved, &s;upplying in &s;ome mea&s;ure my &s;elf tho&s;e Fi|gures
which were left unde&s;cribed by him. The Two la&s;t I drew my &s;elf from &s;ome
figured Stones I happen'd to meet with, not far from</HI> Bri&s;tol, <HI>&s;ome Years &s;ince; a|bout
which time I gave the De&s;igns to Dr.</HI> Hook, <HI>together with a Particular Ex|plication
of the Figures, but by Mis&s;ortune did not keep an exact Copy of what I
then gave him, which, among&s;t others of his Papers, is lo&s;t. I have endeavoured to

<P>I have de&s;igned 15 &s;everal &s;orts of Snail rather than Snake-&s;tones, call'd
by &s;ome Authors <HI>Cornua Ammonis,</HI> or <HI>Sceleta Serpentum,</HI> all of them, both of
different Sub&s;tances and various Shapes; but yet all of them agreeing in
the&s;e Proprieties, that they were made of a Tapering or Pyramidal Body,
coil'd up together, &s;o as that the Tip or Point of it was in the Center, and
the Ba&s;e outmo&s;t; next that, in the coiling up, the Axis of this Pyramidal
Body kept exactly in the &s;ame Plane. 3. That all of them were ridged
or furrow'd with Rings, Furrows, or Proturberances and Depre&s;&s;ions, which
re&s;pected the Center of the Spiral, for the mo&s;t part, but were moulded and
rang'd each of them different ways, all of them very regular, and exceeding|ly
ornamental. 4. That in the coiling the le&s;&s;er and inner Parts &s;unk, as it
were, always into the in&s;ide of the greater encompa&s;&s;ing Part. 5. That all
of them had Diaphragms, or &s;eparating Valves, whereby the Parts might
oft-times be ea&s;ily &s;eparated. 6. That the <HI>Fimbriae,</HI> or Edges of the&s;e Dia|phragms,
were in mo&s;t of the&s;e Stones very vi&s;ible; in others of them,
where they were &s;omewhat more ob&s;cure, they might be made apparent, by
&s;craping or rubbing away the out&s;ides of them. 7. That the&s;e <HI>Fimbriae</HI> or Ed|ges
appear'd on the Surface, like the Out-lines of &s;ome curious Foliage, a
Specimen of &s;ome of which I have given in the 3d and 10th Figures. This,
<PB N="282" REF="253">
upon Examination of them, I found to proceed from the Fulne&s;s of the Edges
of the Diaphragms whereby the Edges were waved or plaited &s;omewhat in
the manner of a Ruff. 8. That mo&s;t of them were covered with a very cu|riou&s;ly
poli&s;h'd, as well as curiou&s;ly carv'd Surface, &s;ome of them &s;hining like
burni&s;h'd Bra&s;s, as tho&s;e of the 1&s;t and 2d Figures; others like Bra&s;s, tar|ni&s;h'd
Black, but rubb'd &s;mooth; others of them like tran&s;parent Horn, as
the 12th Figure; others like Coperas-&s;tones; others like a coarfer &s;ort of
white Marble; others like black Marble. 9. That from the&s;e poli&s;ht Surfaces
one might oftimes ea&s;ily pick off a Sub&s;tance exactly re&s;embling the plaited
&s;hining Sub&s;tances of a Shell. and this did very vi&s;ibly in many of them co|ver
the internal &s;tony Body, with a Coat two or three times as thick as a
Snail's Shell, 10. That the bigge&s;t end of the&s;e Spiral Bodies was always
imperfect without any determinate Figure. 11. That many of the&s;e Spiral Bo|dies
&s;eem'd, as if they had been broken and &s;hatter'd, and had grown together
again in an irregular Po&s;ture. 12. That many of them were compounded of &s;e|veral
Sub&s;tances, the Spaces between the Diaphragms being &s;ometimes fill'd
with one kind of Sub&s;tance, &s;ometimes with another, and &s;ometimes they were
found empty, only all the &s;ides of the Diaphragm were cover'd with a kind of
Tooth-Sparr. 13. There were many of the&s;e which were at fir&s;t included
in Stones, out of which they might ea&s;ily be &s;eparated, &s;o as to leave a per|fect
Impre&s;&s;ion like them&s;elves; but in mo&s;t of tho&s;e incompa&s;&s;ing Bodies,
the Impre&s;&s;ion was bigger than the impre&s;&s;ing Body, by the thickne&s;s of a thin
Shell, which &s;eemed to have been heretofore the Cau&s;e of both
Impre&s;&s;ions,
but was worn away and decay'd by the Injury of time; they differ'd one from
another chiefly in the&s;e Particulars: Fir&s;t, That the Ba&s;es or Planes &s;uppo&s;ed
to cut the&s;e &s;pirall'd Bodies at right Angles, with the Circumference and
Plane thro' the Axis, were of different Figures; as that of the fir&s;t Figure
was much like that of a common Nautilus, being &s;omewhat like the Figure
of a Turki&s;h Cre&s;cent; but the Diaphragms were not &s;mooth and plain like
tho&s;e of a Nautilus, but full and ruffled like the Leaves of Sea-wrack, and &s;e|veral
other luxuriant Vegetables, and that (which appear'd by the Foliage
vi&s;ible on the Surface) the Diaphragms were much thicker and clo&s;er
together: This on the out&s;ide was like poli&s;h'd Silver, but the in&s;ide of a
Sub&s;tance not much unlike blue Slate, but clo&s;er, harder, and heavier.
That of the 3d Figure was of a Figure, as if the former had been pre&s;s'd
quite flat; &s;o that in&s;tead of the round Back in the 2d Figure, this has a
Back terminated with a &s;harp Edge, as in the 4th Figure, 'tis all over almo&s;t
cover'd with a &s;hining Sub&s;tance not unlike a Sub&s;tance we call Alchimy, or
whited? Bra&s;s; on this the Foliage of the Edges of the Diaphragms is very
vi&s;ible, one of which I have de&s;cribed in its po&s;ture, as at <HI>a,</HI> and 3 others
of them, that the Curio&s;ity of them might be the more vi&s;ible, I have de&s;cri|bed
by the help of a Lens in the 5th Figure. Somewhat like to this is that
of the 6th Figure; but that in&s;tead of an edged Back, this is hollowed or
furrowed not unlike the Wheel of a Pully, with two protuberant Ridges on
either &s;ide, as is vi&s;ible in the 7th Figure; the Surface is undulated like the
former two, but &s;omewhat more manife&s;tly, the Fa&s;hion of which Waves are
not unlike the Ribs of wicker Screens, 2, 3, 4, and &s;ometimes more of them
uniting at la&s;t together into one more con&s;picuous Rib which cro&s;&s;es the Cen|ter;
the other &s;ide of this was broken &s;o that the Diaphragms and &s;everal
hollow Cavities between them were to be &s;een, 'twas of a Sub&s;tance &s;ome|what
like the Ru&s;t of Iron. That of Figure the 8th was of a Sub&s;tance &s;ome|what
like <HI>Portland</HI>-&s;tone but clo&s;er and harder. The tran&s;ver&s;e Section of
it was much like the former, as may be &s;een in the 9th Figure: The Back of
it was gutter'd and knobbed very like a <HI>Japan&punc;</HI> Nautilus, one of which I
have in Mr. <HI>Colwall's</HI> Gift: The Ribs al&s;o, or Furrows of the Side were not
much unlike, only they were &s;omewhat finer wrought with Knobs or Buttons,
as may be perceived by the Figure. The Knobs and Surface of the 10th was
&s;omewhat like this, but that they were a little more gro&s;s, as is vi&s;ible by the
Figure; this was of the Colour of a Bone that has been long buried in the
Ground, and of a &s;tony Sub&s;tance almo&s;t as hard as a Flint; the outward
Shell that &s;eems to have cover'd it, was quite worn away, and all the Partitions

or Edges of the Diaphragms were mo&s;t con&s;picuous, the tran&s;ver&s;e Section
you have in the 11th Figure. The Snail-&s;tone de&s;crib'd by the 12th Figure
was of pellucid Pebble, and look'd almo&s;t like Horn; that this had
Diaphragms al&s;o, is evident by the end of it, which is bounded by one, as
may be &s;een by the 13th Figure, which &s;hews al&s;o the tran&s;ver&s;e Section of it.
It had a Spine or Quill <HI>a,</HI> coiled about the back of it, the bigge&s;t part of which
was broken off, and only the hollow part of the Quill of the Shell was left, as
at <HI>b</HI> in the 12th: But at <HI>c</HI> the Quill was intire, and the Sub&s;tance that fill'd
the hollow of it, was tran&s;parent Pebble like the re&s;t of the Stone; the in|compa&s;&s;ing
Shell was much worn away, only in &s;ome Parts of it 'twas vi&s;ible
enough.</P>
<P>The &s;mall one in the 14th Figure was much of the &s;ame Make, the Shell
that covered it was black like the other, its End was al&s;o terminated by a
Diaphragm, as is vi&s;ible in the 15th Figure, where the tran&s;ver&s;e Section
is al&s;o de&s;crib'd; but the Sub&s;tance that fill'd it was quite differing, being a
kind of Pyrites or Coperas-&s;tone. The &s;mall one of the 16th Figure was of a
Shape participating of the 1&s;t and 3d, the tran&s;ver&s;e Section of it &s;hewing
it to be thinner than the 1&s;t, but thicker than the 3d, was terminated by a
Diaphragm very finely leav'd, and with viewing it very inten&s;ely, I could
perceive the Sutures very finely wrought, much like tho&s;e of the 5th Figure:
It was fill'd with a black, &s;tony Sub&s;tance, and on the other Side of it (being
a little broken) &s;everal of the Cavities between the Diaphragms appear'd
empty. The little Part of one de&s;crib'd in the 18th Figure, was compound|ed
as it were of the 8th and 14th, as may be &s;een by the tran&s;ver&s;e Section of
it. Fig. 19. This, as the re&s;t, had vi&s;ible Diaphragms al&s;o, 'twas of a Sub&s;tance
like ru&s;ty Iron: The&s;e preceding were all of them of a Figure that taper'd
very much, &s;o as the Spiral from a very large Circumference, was pre&s;ently
contracted into a little one; but the following were of a Figure more pro|tracted,
and made many more Revolutions before they ended. Of this kind
the 20th was the plaine&s;t, re&s;embling that of the fir&s;t of the other kind;
'twas ribb'd not much unlike it, and the tran&s;ver&s;e Section was much the
&s;ame with that of the 2d Figure, as is vi&s;ible in the 21&s;t Figure.</P>
<P>The 22d was &s;omewhat like the 12th, but of a &s;maller Spiral; it was ter|minated
with a Diaphragm, and had a &s;mall Spine or Quill which was laid
round the Back of it, as may be &s;een by the 23d Figure; the Shell of it was
yet &s;ticking on it, and it look'd very like burni&s;ht Bra&s;s; it &s;eem'd to be a
very hard Stone. The 24th &s;omewhat re&s;embled the 14th, the Surface of it
may be perceiv'd by the 24th, and the tran&s;ver&s;e Section by the 25th Figure;
'twas a Pyrites, and one part of it was di&s;&s;olv'd into Salt by the Air: I had
two or three others of the &s;ame &s;hape, one of a kind of grey Marble, ano|ther
of a Flint, a third of an iron Stone, which I have de&s;crib'd in the 26th
Figure, the Stone incompa&s;&s;ing it, and the filling of the Shell it &s;elf being
both of the &s;ame Sub&s;tance: One of the&s;e was brui&s;ed in the hardning, &s;o
that the Cracks of the Shell were very vi&s;ible; the like Accident was com|mon
to many of the re&s;t, and the Shell encompa&s;&s;ing was of a di&s;tinct Sub|&s;tance
from the re&s;t, and was ea&s;ie to be pick'd off. But the prettie&s;t of all
the re&s;t was the 27th, where the &s;everal Coats of the Shell and Diaphragms
were very di&s;tinct, tho' they &s;eem'd to be all petrify'd and turn'd to another
Sub&s;tance. It had been very much broken before the hardning, and all the
Cracks of the Shell were very di&s;tinct; and which &s;eem'd a little &s;trange,
&s;ome Parts of it were thru&s;t outward, as if it had been fill'd with Water; and,
by Congelation, the Ice had &s;well'd and broken out the &s;ides of it, which
probably might be the Cau&s;e; for all between the Diaphragms it was fill'd
with a tran&s;parent Spar or Caulk, &s;uch as is u&s;ually dug out of Lead Mines,
a Sub&s;tance between Cry&s;tal and Talk; the Original of which Sub&s;tance
&s;eems to me not unlikely to be congeal'd petrifying Water; the Valuta of it
was curiou&s;ly ribb'd or moulded, and the Foliage or Edges of the Diaphragms
were very Ornamental. It had a Spine or Quill went round the back of it,
as &s;everal of the former; the tran&s;ver&s;e Section you have in the 28th
Figure.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="256">
The Surface of the 29th was of a peculiar kind of carving, as is vi&s;ible by
the Figure; it was of a reddi&s;h Flint, the out&s;ide very &s;mooth and poli&s;h'd, the
&s;ide not vi&s;ible was not &s;o perfect, being broken in &s;everal places, and di&s;co|vering
the Diaphragms, and that &s;ome of the interjacent Spaces were empty.
The greater End of this looking very irregular, I broke with a &s;mart &s;troke
of a Hammer a little piece off from it, and di&s;cover'd two &s;mall Snakes-&s;tones
within it, which probably had been tumbled into the Mouth of it before it
was concreted; for they were of the very &s;ame Sub&s;tance, but of a differing
Figure from any I have yet de&s;crib'd, being ribb'd like the 24th, but only
they were bigger and farther di&s;tant, and they went quite round the back. This
la&s;t, and another like the 24th were taken up near <HI>Kein&s;ham,</HI> about 4 or 5
Miles from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and &s;ent by Dr. <HI>Beal,</HI> whence al&s;o I &s;uppo&s;e &s;everal of the
other may have come.</P>
<P>Had they not been much too large, I would have de&s;crib'd al&s;o one or two
of tho&s;e <HI>Cornua Ammonis,</HI> pre&s;ented to the Repo&s;itory by the Right Honourable
<HI>Henry Howard</HI> of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> which are in Diameter about 2 &frac12; Foot, and the
concave Impre&s;&s;ion of one of a greater Magnitude, which I found in a Piece
of <HI>Portland</HI>-&s;tone. The&s;e large Stones are between 300 and 400 Weight, and
of a Stone in all Particulars much like <HI>Portland</HI>-&s;tone, whence I &s;uppo&s;e they
were at fir&s;t fetch'd: They are all &s;hap'd much like that of the 20th Figure;
but the coiled Cone is not altogether &s;o round, nor &s;o &s;lender, or of &s;o acute
an Angle, but the Undulations of the Surfaces are alike, and &s;o are al&s;o the
Diaphragms. I have been al&s;o told by Per&s;ons of very good Credit, that
they have &s;een in <HI>Darby&s;hire</HI> and <HI>York&s;hire</HI> Snail-&s;tones of a much more prodi|gious
bigne&s;s, 3 or 4 times as big as the&s;e; which I have not had an Oppor|tunity
to &s;end to enquire more curiou&s;ly into, though I have much de&s;ired;
and &s;o much the rather, becau&s;e it &s;eems much more to excel in bigne&s;s all
other Shell-fi&s;hes we know, than the Giants (Stories tells us of) did exceed
the ordinary Size of Men now living.</P>
<P>I have, to parallel the&s;e Snake-&s;tones added in Table II. a De&s;cription
of three &s;everal &s;orts of Nautil-&s;hells, becau&s;e I had no greater variety by
me, though I have &s;een many other kinds. The 1&s;t Figure repre&s;ents a large
Nautilus-&s;hell cut <HI>per axin,</HI> and manife&s;ts the manner how the Diaphragms
are placed in that kind of Shell in the concave Part thereof; and the 2d Fi|gure
&s;hews how they are placed up the convex &s;ide; this being a &s;mall
Piece of the middle of a Nautilus-&s;hell, and the wreathed Lines &s;hew where
the Diaphragms join'd upon the back thereof. The 3d Figure repre&s;ents a
<HI>Japan</HI> Nautilus-&s;hell, crenated on the &s;ides, and knobbed on the back, much
In the manner as &s;everal of the Snakes-&s;tones are. The 4th Figure repre&s;ents
a &s;mall Piece of a peculiar kind of Nautilus, who&s;e conical Body is divided by
&s;mall Diaphragms under every of the black circuling Lines, and is coil'd &s;o
as its roundne&s;s is kept, and the Parts do not touch one another. The Name
of it&punc; I know not, being no where de&s;crib'd by any Author.</P>
<P>In Table III. I have de&s;cribed &s;ome &s;orts of Helmet-&s;tones, of which I
have a very great Variety, and it would have been tedious to have added
them all in this Place. I have likewi&s;e de&s;cribed three &s;orts of Button-&s;tones,
all, and every of which &s;eem to have been nothing el&s;e but the filling up of
&s;everal &s;orts of Echini-&s;hells, of which the European Coa&s;ts afford a great
Variety. The 1&s;t, 2d, and 3d Figures, repre&s;ent three &s;everal &s;orts of But|ton-&s;tones,
all of them of very hard Flints, two of them, namely the two
le&s;s, join'd to, or &s;hap'd as 'twere out of irregular Pieces of Flint of the &s;ame
Sub&s;tance. They have all of them this in common with all the other &s;orts
of Helmet-&s;tones, that they have two Parts, which &s;eem to have been the
fillings up of two Holes or Vents in the Shell, and they are divided into
five Parts, though every of them of di&s;tinct Shapes, as may be &s;een by the
Figures. That of the 1&s;t Figure al&s;o hath this Property, in common with
the finer &s;ort of Helmet-&s;tones, that it exhibits the Sutures or Junctures of
the Shell, as are more plainly to be &s;een in the 4th, 5th, and 6th Figures.
The 4th Figure repre&s;ents a Helmet-&s;tone, look'd down upon almo&s;t di|rectly,

exhibiting the Impre&s;&s;ions of the &s;everal Holes, Sutures, and Cracks
that appear upon the top of one of the&s;e Stones The 5th and 6th Figures
repre&s;ent another Helmet-&s;tone of the &s;ame kind with the former, but le&s;s
look'd upon again&s;t the bottom and &s;ide, exhibiting the Impre&s;&s;ions of the
&s;everal Holes, Sutures, and Cracks, that were in the imprinting Shell from

the bottom and top of another &s;ort of Helmet-&s;tone, which &s;eems to be
the filling up of a kind of <HI>Echini</HI>-&s;hell, very like to tho&s;e found in <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>
and <HI>Cornwal,</HI> one of which I have delineated in the 10th Figure: This la&s;t
kind was of Chalk. I have &s;everal other &s;orts, which I have not now time

as hard as <HI>Portland,</HI> &s;ome of black, red, grey, and other Flints, &s;ome of Co|peras-&s;tone,
&s;ome of other kinds of Stone, none of Spar. I would to this
have added the De&s;cription of a great Variety of <HI>Echini</HI>-&s;hells, divers of which
I have by me in the Repo&s;itory of the Royal Society, and others that I have
met with el&s;ewhere, but that I &s;hall do it el&s;ewhere: They are indeed almo&s;t
infinite, but all concur in the&s;e Properties which all Helmet-&s;tones likewi&s;e
have. Fir&s;t, that they are di&s;tingui&s;h'd into five Parts, by Sutures, Ribs, and
Furrows. Secondly, that they have two Vent-holes: They have divers of
them al&s;o little Edges, being the Impre&s;&s;ions of the Sutures, and divers lit|tle
rows of Pins, being the Impre&s;&s;ions of the &s;mall Holes; and any one that
will diligently and impartially examine both the Stones and the Shells, and
compare the one with the other, will, I can a&s;&s;ure him, find greater rea&s;on
to per&s;wade him of the Truth of my Po&s;ition, than any I have yet urged, or

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<DATE><HI>Bri&s;tol, Aug.</HI> 17. 1687.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>IN an&s;wer to &s;ome of your Enquiries, as to the <HI>Cornua Ammonis,</HI> and other
Shell-like Stones found about <HI>Kein&s;ham,</HI> and other Places, I &s;hall give
you this &s;hort Information of my Di&s;coveries, and pre&s;ent you with the
Draughts of &s;ome I happen'd to meet with there, and in other Places not
very far di&s;tant, that is, in Part of <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Cornua Ammonis,</HI> near <HI>Kein&s;ham,</HI> lie mo&s;t of them upon a little Hill, or
ri&s;ing Ground, above <HI>Kein&s;ham</HI>-Bridge; the Place, as I take it, is about 18
Foot above the River: The River there runs half round the Foot of the Hill,
where they lye very thick almo&s;t to touch each other, and are all of the large
fort bedded in an hard Rock or Stone; &s;ome al&s;o I found near a Mile from
thence in the Stone-walls of their Fields, and on the way in the Lanes; and
at <HI>Stowey,</HI> four or five Miles from <HI>Kein&s;ham,</HI> I &s;aw &s;ome Snake-&s;tones, Oy&s;ter,
and Cockle-&s;hells petrified and bedded in hard Stone, where is al&s;o a petri|fying
Spring incru&s;tating the Mo&s;s and Gra&s;s, and all the wooden Troughs,
by which it is conveyed with a &s;tony Sub&s;tance. Where they are not found
fa&s;tned to a Rock, I found them encompa&s;&s;ed in a pretty large irregular
Ma&s;s of Stone, not &s;andy, but rather like a whiti&s;h Clay harden'd, and the&s;e
&s;tony Ma&s;&s;es bedded in a loamy kind of Earth; in which &s;oft Earth are al&s;o
found Star-&s;tones, and a &s;ort of petrified Cockle-&s;hells, &s;uch as Fig. 7. Tab.
VI. 1 found none of the Snake-&s;tones to have above 6 Turns, except one
Mr. <HI>Beaumont</HI> &s;hewed me of &s;even, and another among&s;t Mr. <HI>cole</HI>'s Rareties.
But that which I e&s;teemed the greate&s;t Curio&s;ity, was a large Stone of the
true Shape and Figure of the common, <HI>Nautilus,</HI> or Mother of Pearl-&s;hell,
which tho' but a part of the whole Shell, weighs about 30 pound: This I
found in one of the dry Walls, near <HI>Kein&s;ham,</HI> and not far from it another
Piece of the &s;ame; the&s;e are figured in the VIIth Table, Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4; and
in the&s;e not only the Diaphragms are very vi&s;ible, but the Holes al&s;o in the
middle of them, by which the Gut or String pa&s;&s;es from one to another, in
all re&s;pects an&s;wering to that of the <HI>Nautilus</HI>-&s;hell; which, I think, will evince
this at lea&s;t to be a petrify'd Shell, tho' much larger than any of that kind
that have been yet mention'd. Going down from <HI>Mendip</HI>-hills to <HI>Okey</HI>-hole,
I found a &s;mall Mu&s;cle-&s;hell petrify'd, on this the Shell was yet di&s;coverable
in &s;ome Places; this is figured, Tab. VI. Fig. 1.</P>
<P>On the Face of the Rocks that are on the &s;ides of the <HI>Avon,</HI> not far from
St. <HI>Vincent</HI>'s Rock, I found &s;everal wood-like Pieces of Stone &s;tanding out a
little from the Rock it &s;elf; &s;ome of which I have broke off, and have repre|&s;ented
them in the Figures, Tab. VII. Fig. 5, 6, 7, and 8, and &s;ome &s;uch like
Bits of Wood in the Earth between the Layers of Stone unpetrify'd. But I
&s;hall at pre&s;ent detain you no longer, but for a more exact Information refer
to the Figures them&s;elves; which I can a&s;&s;ure you are truly de&s;ign'd, and are
all Stones or Petrifactions, except the 6th Figure.</P>

<P>The&s;e, and the like Shapes, becau&s;e many of them are curious, have &s;o far
wrought on &s;ame Men, that they have endeavoured to give us an Expli|cation
of the manner of their Formation; in doing of which they have &s;o far
rambled from the true and genuine Cau&s;e of them, that they have left the
Matter much more difficult than they found it. Among&s;t the re&s;t, <HI>Gaffarel,</HI> a
<PB N="288" REF="265">
<HI>French</HI> Writer, &s;eem&s; not the lea&s;t mi&s;taken, who has transferr'd them over
to the Confirmation, as he thinks, of his A&s;trological and Magical Fancy;
and thinks that as they were produced from &s;ome extraordinary Cele&s;tial
Influence, and that the A&s;pects and Po&s;itions of the fix'd Stars and Planets
conduc'd to their Generation, &s;o that they al&s;o have in them a &s;ecret Vertue
whereby they do at a di&s;tance work Miracles on things of the like Shape.
But the&s;e, as fanta&s;tical and groundle&s;s, I &s;hall not &s;pend time on at pre&s;ent
to refute, nor on the Conjectures and Hypothe&s;es of divers others; which
though perhaps &s;omewhat more tolerable than that I la&s;t recited, yet mo&s;t
of them have recour&s;e to &s;ome vegetative or pla&s;tick Vertue inherent in the
Parts of the Earth where they were made, or in the very parcels of which
they con&s;i&s;t, which, to me, &s;eems not at all con&s;onant to the other workings
of Nature; for tho&s;e more curiou&s;ly carved and beautiful Forms are u&s;ually
be&s;tow'd on &s;ome vegetable or animal Body. But my Bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent
&s;hall not be &s;o much to confute others Conjectures, as to make probable &s;ome
of my own; which tho' at the fir&s;t hearing they may &s;eem &s;omewhat para|doxical,
yet if the Rea&s;ons that have induced me thereunto be well con&s;i|der'd
and weigh'd, I hope at lea&s;t they may &s;eem po&s;&s;ibie, if not more than a
little probable.</P>
<P>The particular Productions of this kind that I have taken notice of my
&s;elf in my own Enquiries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Enumeration of the Phenomena.</NOTE> and which I find di&s;per&s;ed up and down in the
Writing of others, may be reduced under &s;ome one or other of the&s;e Gene|ral
Heads or Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1">Fir&s;t, That there are found in mo&s;t Countries of the Earth, and even in
&s;uch where it is &s;omewhat difficult to imagine (by rea&s;on of their va&s;t di&s;tance
from the Sea or Waters how they &s;hould come there) great quantities of
Bodies re&s;embling both in Sub&s;tance and Shape the Shells of divers &s;orts of
Shell-fi&s;hes; and many of them &s;o exactly, that any one that knew not
whence they came, would without the lea&s;t &s;cruple firmly believe them to be
the Shells of &s;uch Fi&s;hes: But being found in Places &s;o unlikely to have pro|duced
them, and not conceiving how el&s;e they &s;hould come there, they are
generally believed to be real Stones form'd into the&s;e Shapes, either by &s;ome
pla&s;tick Vertue inherent in tho&s;e Parts of the Earth, which is extravagant
enough, or el&s;e by &s;ome Cele&s;tial Influence or A&s;pect of the Planets operating
at a di&s;tance upon the yielding Matter of the Parts of the Earth, which is
much more extravagant. Of this kind are all tho&s;e &s;everal &s;orts of Oy&s;ter-&s;hells,
Cockle-&s;hells, Mu&s;cle-&s;hells, Periwinkle-&s;hells, and the like, which
are found in <HI>England, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Norway, Ru&s;&s;ia, A&s;ia</HI>
and <HI>Africa,</HI> and divers other Places; of which I have very good Te&s;timonies
from Authors of good Credit.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2">Secondly, That there often have been, and are &s;till daily found in other
Parts of the Earth buried below the pre&s;ent Surface thereof divers &s;orts of
Bodies, be&s;ides &s;uch as I newly mention'd, re&s;embling both in Shape, Sub|&s;tance,
and other Proprieties, the Parts of Vegetables, having the perfect
Rind or Bark, Pith, Pores, Roots, Branches, Gums, and other con&s;tituent
Parts of Wood, though in another po&s;ture, lying for the mo&s;t part Horizon|tal,
and &s;ometimes inverted, and much differing from that of the like Vege|tables
when growing, and wanting al&s;o, for the mo&s;t part, the Leaves, &s;mal|ler
Roots and Branches, the Flower and Fruit, and the like &s;maller Parts,
which are common to Trees of that kind; of which &s;ort is the <HI>Lignum Fo&s;&s;ile,</HI>
which is found in divers Parts of <HI>England, Scotland, Ireland,</HI> and divers Parts
of <HI>Italy, Germany,</HI> the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and indeed almo&s;t in every Country
of the World.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3">Thirdly, That there are often found in divers other Parts of the Earth,
Bodies re&s;embling the whole Bodies of Fi&s;hes, and other Animals and Vege|tables,
or the Parts of them, which are of a much le&s;s permanent Nature than
the Shells abovemention'd, &s;uch as Fruits, Leaves, Barks, Woods, Roots,
Mu&s;hrooms, Bones, Hoofs, Claws, Horns, Teeth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but in all other Pro|prieties
<PB N="289" REF="266">
of their Sub&s;tance, &s;ave their Shape, are perfect Stones, Clays, or
Earths, and &s;eem to have nothing at all of Figure in the inward Parts of
them. Of this kind are tho&s;e, commonly call'd Thunder-bolts, Helmet-&s;tones,
Serpentine-&s;tones, or Snake-&s;tones, Rams-horns, Brain-&s;tones, Star-&s;tones,
Screw-&s;tones, Wheel-&s;tones, and the like.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That the Parts of the Earth in which the&s;e kinds have been<MILESTONE N="4">
found, are &s;ome of them &s;ome hundred of Miles di&s;tant from any Sea, as in
&s;everal of the Hills of <HI>Hungary,</HI> the Mountain <HI>Taurus,</HI> the <HI>Alpes, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, That divers of tho&s;e Parts are many Scores, nay, &s;ome many<MILESTONE N="5">
Hundreds of Fathoms above the Level of the Surface of the next adjoining
Sea, there having been found of them on &s;ome of the mo&s;t Inland, and on
&s;ome of the highe&s;t Mountains in the World.</P>
<P>Sixthly, That divers other Parts where the&s;e Sub&s;tances have been found,<MILESTONE N="6">
are many Fathoms below the Level both of the Surface of the next adjoining
Sea, and of the Surface of the Earth it&s;elf, they having been found buried in
the bottoms of &s;ome of the deepe&s;t Mines and Wells, and inclo&s;ed in &s;ome of
the harde&s;t Rocks and toughe&s;t Metals. Of this we have continual In&s;tances
in the deape&s;t Lead and Tin-mines, and a particular In&s;tance in the Well dug
in <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> where at the Depth of 99 Foot was found a Layer of Sea-&s;hells
mixed with Sand of 4 Foot thickne&s;s, after the Diggers had pa&s;t through
7 Foot of Garden-mould, 9 Foot more of black Peat, 9 Foot more of &s;oft
Clay, 8 of Sand, 4 of Earth, 10 of Potters-clay, 4 more of Earth, 10 Foot
more of Sand, upon which the Stakes or Piles of the <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> Hou&s;es re&s;t;
then 2 Foot more of Potters-clay, and 4 of white Gravel, 5 of dry Earth,
1 of mix'd, 14 of Sand, 3 of a Sandy Clay, and 5 more of Potters-clay mix'd
with Sand. Now below this Layer of Shells immediately joining to it, was a
Bed of Potters-clay of no le&s;s than 102 Foot thick; but of this more
hereafter.</P>
<P>Seventhly, That there are often found in the mid&s;t of the Bodies of very<MILESTONE N="7">
hard and clo&s;e Stone, &s;uch as Marbles, Flints, <HI>Portland,</HI> and Purbeck-&s;tone,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> which lye upon, or very near to the Surface of the Earth, great quantities
of the&s;e kind of figured Bodies or Shells, and that there are many of &s;uch
Stones which &s;eem to be made of nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e Phaenomena, as they have hitherto much puzzled all Natural Hi&s;torians
and Philo&s;ophers to give an Account of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Difficulty may be &s;olved.</NOTE> &s;o in truth are they in them&s;elves &s;o
really wonderful, that 'tis not ea&s;ie without making multitudes of Ob&s;ervations,
and comparing them very diligently with the Hi&s;tories and Experiments that
have been already made, to fix upon a plau&s;ible Solution of them. For as
on the one &s;ide, it &s;eems very difficult to imagine that Nature formed all
the&s;e curious Bodies for no other End, than only to play the Mimick in the
Mineral Kingdom, and only to imitate what &s;he had done for &s;ome more
noble End, and in a greater Perfection in the Vegetable and Animal King|doms;
and the &s;tricte&s;t Survey that I have made both of the Bodies them|&s;elves,
and of the Circum&s;tances obvious enough about them, do not in the
lea&s;t hint any thing el&s;e; they being promi&s;cuou&s;ly found of any kind of Sub|&s;tance,
and having not the lea&s;t appearance of any internal or &s;ub&s;tantial
Form, but only of an external or figured Superficies. As, I &s;ay, 'tis &s;ome|thing
har&s;h, to imagine that the&s;e thus qualified Bodies &s;hould, by an imme|diate
pla&s;tick Vertue, be thus &s;haped by Nature contrary to her general Me|thod
of acting in all other Bodies; &s;o on the other &s;ide, it may &s;eem at fir&s;t
hearing &s;omewhat difficult to conceive how all tho&s;e Bodies, if they either be
the real Shells or Bodies of Fi&s;h, or other Animals or Vegetables, which they
repre&s;ent, or an Impre&s;&s;ion left on tho&s;e Sub&s;tances from &s;uch Bodies, &s;hould
be, in &s;uch great quantities, tran&s;ported into Places &s;o unlikely to have re|ceived
them from any help of Man, or from any other obvious Means.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="267">
The former of the&s;e ways of &s;olving the&s;e Phaenomena, I confe&s;s I cannot
for the Rea&s;ons I now mention'd, by any means a&s;&s;ent unto; but the latter,
tho' it has &s;ome Difficulties al&s;o, &s;eems to me not only po&s;&s;ible, but pro|bable.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1">The greate&s;t Objections that can be made again&s;t it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Object.</NOTE> are, Fir&s;t, by what
means tho&s;e Shells, Woods, and other &s;uch like Sub&s;tances (if they really
are the Bodies they repre&s;ent) &s;hould be tran&s;ported to, and be buried in
the Places where they are found? And,</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2">Secondly, Why many of them &s;hould be of Sub&s;tances wholly differing
from tho&s;e of the Bodies they repre&s;ent; there being &s;ome of them which
repre&s;ent Shells of almo&s;t all kinds of Sub&s;tances, Clay, Chalk, Marble, &s;oft
Stone, harder Stone, Marble, Flint, Marcha&s;ite, Ore, and the like.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to both which, and &s;ome other of le&s;s Importance, which I &s;hall
afterwards mention, give me leave to propound the&s;e following Propo&s;itions,
which I &s;hall endeavour to make probable. Of the&s;e in their Order.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1">My fir&s;t Propo&s;ition then is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An&s;wered by the&s;e Propo&s;itions.</NOTE> That all, or the greate&s;t part of the&s;e curiou&s;ly
figured Bodies found up and down in divers Parts of the World, are either
tho&s;e Animal or Vegetable Sub&s;tances they repre&s;ent converted into Stone,
by having their Pores fill'd up with &s;ome petri&s;ying liquid Sub&s;tance, where|by
their Parts are, as it were, lock'd up and cemented together in their Na|tural
Po&s;ition and Contexture; or el&s;e they are the la&s;ting Impre&s;&s;ions made
on them at fir&s;t, whil&s;t a yielding Sub&s;tance by the immediate Application of
fuch Animal or Vegetable Body as was &s;o &s;haped, and that there was nothing
el&s;e concurring to their Production, &s;ave only the yielding of the Matter to
receive the Impre&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as heated Wax affords to the Seal; or el&s;e a &s;ub|&s;iding
or hardning of the Matter, after by &s;ome kind of Fluidity it had per|fectly
fill'd or inclo&s;ed the figuring Vegetable or Animal Sub&s;tance, after the
manner as a Statue is made of Plai&s;ter of <HI>Paris,</HI> or Alaba&s;ter-du&s;t beaten, and
boil'd, mixed with Water and poured into a Mould.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2">Secondly, Next that there &s;eems to have been &s;ome extraordinary Cau&s;e,
which did concur to the promoting of this Coagulation or Petrification,
and that every kind of Matter is not of it &s;elf apt to coagulate into a &s;trong
Sub&s;tance, &s;o hard as we find mo&s;t of tho&s;e Bodies to con&s;i&s;t of.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3">Thirdly, That the concurrent Cau&s;es a&s;&s;i&s;ting towards the turning of the&s;e
Sub&s;tances into Stone, &s;eem to have been one of the&s;e, either &s;ome kind of
fiery Exhalation ari&s;ing from &s;ubterraneous Eruptions or Earthquakes; or
&s;econdly, a Saline Sub&s;tance, whither working by Di&s;&s;olution and Congela|tion,
or Cry&s;tallization, or el&s;e by Precipitation and Coagulation; or thirdly,
&s;ome glutinous or bituminous Matter, which upon growing dry or &s;etling
grows hard, and unites &s;andy Bodies together into a pretty hard Stone; or
fourthly, a very long continuation of the&s;e Bodies under a great degree of
Cold and Compre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4">Fourthly, That Waters them&s;elves may in tract of time be perfectly tran&s;|muted
into Stone, and remain a Body of that Con&s;titution without being re|ducible
by any Art yet commonly known.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="5">Fifthly, That divers other fluid Sub&s;tances have after a long continuance at
re&s;t, have &s;ettled and congealed into much more hard and permanent Sub&s;tances.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6">Sixthly. That a great part of the Surface of the Earth hath been &s;ince the
Creation transformed and made of another Nature; namely, many Parts
which have been Sea are now Land, and divers other Parts are now Sea
which were once a firm Land; Mountains have been turned into Plains, and
Plains into Mountains, and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="268">
Seventhly, That divers of the&s;e kind of Transformations have been effected<MILESTONE N="7">
in the&s;e I&s;lands of <HI>Great Britain;</HI> and that 'tis not improbable, but that ma|ny
very Inland Parts of this I&s;land, if not all, may have been heretofore all
cover'd with the Sea, and have had Fi&s;hes &s;wimming over it.</P>
<P>Eighthly, That mo&s;t of tho&s;e Inland Places, where the&s;e kinds of Stones<MILESTONE N="8">
are, or have been found, have been heretofore under the Water; and that
either by the departing of the Waters to another part or &s;ide of the Earth,
by the alteration of the Center of Gravity of the whole Bulk, which is not
$$upo&s;&s;ible; or rather by the Eruption of &s;ome kind of &s;ubterraneous Fires,
or Earthquakes, whereby great quantities of Earth have then been rais'd
above the former Level of tho&s;e Parts, the Waters have been forc'd away
from the Parts they formerly cover'd, and many of tho&s;e Surfaces are now
rai&s;ed above the Level of the Water's Surface many &s;cores of Fathoms.</P>
<P>Ninthly, It &s;eems not improbable, that the tops of the highe&s;t and mo&s;t<MILESTONE N="9">
con&s;iderable Mountains in the World have been under Water, and that they
them&s;elves mo&s;t probably &s;eem to have been the Effects of &s;ome very great

of <HI>Tenariff,</HI> the Pike in the <HI>Tercer as,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>Tenthly, That it &s;eems not improbable, but that the greate&s;t part of the<MILESTONE N="10">
Inequality of the Earth's Surface may have proceeded from the Subver&s;ion and
tumbling thereof by &s;ome preceding Earthquakes.</P>
<P>Eleventhly, That there have been many other Species of Creatures in for|mer<MILESTONE N="11">
Ages, of which we can find none at pre&s;ent; and that 'tis not unlikely
al&s;o but that there may be divers new kinds now, which have not been from
the beginning.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome other Conjectures of mine yet unmention'd, which are
more &s;trange than the&s;e; which I &s;hall defer the mentioning of till &s;ome
other time; becau&s;e tho' I have divers Ob&s;ervations concurring, yet having
not been able to meet with &s;uch as may an&s;wer &s;ome con&s;iderable Objections
that they are liable to, I will rather at pre&s;ent endeavour to make probable
tho&s;e already mentioned, by &s;etting down &s;ome of tho&s;e Ob&s;ervations (for it
would be tedious to in&s;ert all) I have collected, both out of Authors, and
from my own Experience.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t was, That the&s;e figured, Bodies, di&s;per&s;ed over the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fir&s;t Pro|po&s;ition confir|med.</NOTE> are
either the Beings them&s;elves pretrify'd, or the Impre&s;&s;ions made by tho&s;e
Beings. To confirm which, I have diligently examin'd many hundreds of
the&s;e figured Bodies, and have not found the lea&s;t probability of a pla&s;tick
Faculty. For fir&s;t, I have found the &s;ame kind of Impre&s;&s;ion upon Sub&s;tan|ces
of an exceeding differing Nature, whereas Nature in other of her Works
does adapt the &s;ame kind of Sub&s;tance to the &s;ame Shape; the Fle&s;h of a
Hor&s;e is differing from that of a Hog, or Sheep, or from the Wood of a
Tree, or the like; &s;o the Wood of Box, for In&s;tance, is differing from the
Wood of all other Vegetables; and if the outward Figure of the Plant or
Animal differ, to be &s;ure their Fle&s;h al&s;o differs: And under the &s;ame Shape
you always meet with Sub&s;tances of the &s;ame kind; whereas here I have ob|&s;erved
Stones bearing the &s;ame Figure, or rather Impre&s;&s;ion, to be of hugely
differing Natures, &s;ome of Clay, &s;ome of Chalk, &s;ome of Spar, &s;ome of Mar|ble,
&s;ome of a kind of Free-&s;tone, &s;ome like Cry&s;tals or Diamonds, &s;ome
like Flints, others a kind of Marcha&s;ite, others a kind of Ore. Nay, in
the &s;ame figur'd Sub&s;tance I have found divers &s;orts of very differing Bodies
or kinds of Stone, &s;o that one has been made up partly of Stone, partly of
Clay, and partly of Marcha&s;ite, and partly of Spar, according as the Mat|ter
chanced to be jumbled together, and to fill up the Mould of the Shell.</P>
<P>Another Circum&s;tance, which makes this Conjecture the more probable,
is, that the outward Surface only of the Body is form'd, and that the inward
<PB N="292" REF="269">
Part has nothing of Shape that can rea&s;onably be referr'd to it; whereas we
&s;ee that in all other Bodies that Nature gives a Shape to, &s;he figures al&s;o the
internal Parts or the very Sub&s;tance of it, with an appropriate Shape. Thus
in all kinds of Minerals, as Spars, Cry&s;tals, and divers of the precious
Stones, Ores, and the like, the inward Parts of them are always corre&s;pon|dent
to the outward Shape; as in Spar, if the outward Part be &s;hap'd into a
Rhomboidical parallepiped, the inward Part of it is &s;hap'd in the &s;ame
manner, and may be cleft out into a multitude of Bodies of the like Form
and Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>Another Circum&s;tance is, that I have in many found the perfect Shell in|clo&s;ed
making a concave Impre&s;&s;ion on the Body that inclo&s;ed it, and a con|vex
on the Body that it did inclo&s;e; which I have &s;ometimes been able to
take out intire, and found it to be both by its Sub&s;tance and Shape, and re|flective
&s;hining, and the like Circum&s;tances, a real Shell of a Cockle, Peri|winkle,
Mu&s;cle, or the like.</P>
<P>And farther, I have found in the &s;ame place divers of the &s;ame kinds of
Shells, not fill'd with a Matter that was capable of taking the Impre&s;&s;ion,
but with a kind of &s;andy Sub&s;tance; which lying loo&s;e within it could be ea|&s;ily
&s;hook out, leaving the inclo&s;ing Shell perfectly intire and empty; others
I have &s;een which have been of black Flint, wherein the Impre&s;&s;ion has been
made only of a broken Shell, which &s;tuck al&s;o into it; the other Part of the
Surface of that Stone, which was not within the Shell, remaining only form'd
like a common Flint.</P>
<P>And which &s;eems to confirm this Conjecture much more than any of the
former Arguments, I had this la&s;t Summer an Opportunity to ob&s;erve upon
the South-part of <HI>England,</HI> in a Clift who&s;e Bottom the Sea wa&s;h'd, that at a
good, heighth in the Clift above the Surface of the Water, there was a Lay|er,
as I may call it, or Vein of Shells, which was extended in length for &s;ome
Miles: Out of which Layer I digg'd out, and examin'd many hundreds, and
found them to be perfect Shells of Cockles, Periwinkles, Mu&s;cles, and divers
other &s;orts of &s;mall Shell-Fi&s;hes; &s;ome of which were fill'd with the Sand
with which they were mix'd; others remain'd empty, and perfectly intire:
From the Sea-waters wa&s;hing the under part of this Clift, great quantities of
it do every Year tumble or founder down, and fall into the Salt-water, which
are wa&s;h'd al&s;o by &s;everal Mineral-waters i&s;&s;uing out at the bottom of tho&s;e
Clifts. Of the&s;e founder'd Parts I examined very many Parcels, and found
&s;ome of them made into a kind of harden'd Mortar, or very &s;oft Stone,
which I could ea&s;ily with my Foot, and even almo&s;t with my Finger, cru&s;h in
Pieces; others that had lain a longer time expo&s;ed to the Vici&s;&s;itudes of the
ri&s;ing and falling Tides, I found grown into pretty hard Stones; others that
had been yet longer, I found converted into very hard Stone, not much yield|ing
to the hardne&s;s of Flints. Out of divers of the&s;e, I was able to break
and beat out divers intire and perfect Shells, fill'd with a Sub&s;tance which
was converted into a very hard Stone, retaining exactly the Shape of the in|clo&s;ing
Shell. And in the part of the Stone which had encompa&s;s'd the Shell,
there was left remaining the perfect Impre&s;&s;ion and Form of the Shell; the
Shell it &s;elf remaining as yet of its natural white Sub&s;tance, though much de|cay'd
or rotted by time: But the Body inclo&s;ing and included by the Shell, I
found exactly &s;tamp'd like tho&s;e Bodies, who&s;e Figures Authors generally
affirm to be the Product of a Pla&s;tick or Vegetative Faculty working in
Stones.</P>
<P>Another Argument, that the&s;e petrify'd Sub&s;tances are nothing but the
Effects of tho&s;e Shells being fill'd with &s;ome petrifying Sub&s;tance, is this,
That among tho&s;e which are call'd <HI>Cornu-Ammonis,</HI> or Serpentine-&s;tones,
(found about <HI>Kein&s;ham,</HI> and in &s;everal other Parts of <HI>England,</HI> and in other
Countries, as at the <HI>Balnea Bollen&s;ia)</HI> which are indeed nothing el&s;e but the
moulding off from a kind of Shell which is much &s;hap'd like a <HI>Nautilus</HI>-&s;hell,
the whole Cavity being &s;eparated with divers &s;mall Valves or Partitions,
much after the &s;ame manner as tho&s;e Shells of the <HI>Nautilus</HI> are commonly
observed to be. Among the&s;e Stones, I &s;ay, I have, upon breaking, found
&s;ome of the Cavities between tho&s;e Partitions remain almo&s;t quite empty;
<PB N="293" REF="270">
others I have found lined only with a kind of Tartareous, or rather Cry&s;tal|line
Sub&s;tance, which has &s;tuck to the &s;ides, and been figured like Tartar, but
of a clear and transparent Sub&s;tance like Cry&s;tal; whereas others of the Ca|vities
of the &s;ame Stone I have found filled with divers kinds of Sub&s;tances
very differing: Whence I imagine tho&s;e Tartareous Sub&s;tances to be nought
el&s;e but the hardning of &s;ome &s;aline fluid Body, which might &s;oak in through
the Sub&s;tance of the Shell. Others of the&s;e I have, which are quite of a
tran&s;parent Sub&s;tance, and &s;eem to be produced from the Petrifaction of the
Water that had fill'd them; others I have found fill'd with a perfect Flint,
both which I &s;uppo&s;e to be the productions of Water petrify'd: And I may
perhaps hereafter make it probable, that all kinds of Flints and Pebbles have
no other Original.</P>
<P>I could urge many other Arguments to make my fir&s;t Propo&s;ition probable,
that all tho&s;e curiou&s;ly &s;haped Stones, which the mo&s;t curious Naturali&s;ts mo&s;t
admire, are nothing but the Impre&s;&s;ions made by &s;ome real Shell in a Matter
that at fir&s;t was yielding enough, but which is grown harder with time. To
this very Head al&s;o may be referr'd all tho&s;e other kinds of petrify'd Sub|&s;tances,
as Bones, Teeth, Crabbs, Fi&s;hes, Wood, Mo&s;s, Fruit, and the like;
&s;ome of all which Kinds I have examin'd, and by very many Circum&s;tances,
too long to be here in&s;erted, judge them to be nothing el&s;e but a real petri|faction
of tho&s;e Sub&s;tances they re&s;emble.</P>
<P>My Second Propo&s;ition will not be difficult to prove,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;econd pro|po&s;ition corfir|med.</NOTE> That if the&s;e be
the Effects of Petrifaction or Coagulation, it mu&s;t be from &s;ome extraordi|nary
Cau&s;e. And this becau&s;e we find not many Experiments of producing
of them when and where we will; be&s;ides we find that mo&s;t things, e&s;pecially
Animal and Vegetable Sub&s;tances, after they have left off to vegetate, do
&s;oon decay, and by divers ways of Putrefaction and Rotting, loo&s;e their
Forms and return into Du&s;t; as we find Wood, whether expo&s;ed to the Air
or Water, in a little time to wa&s;te and decay; e&s;pecially &s;uch as is expo&s;ed
to the alteration of both, and even in tho&s;e Places where the&s;e petrify'd Sub|&s;tances
are to be met with. The like we find of Animal Sub&s;tances; and
we have but &s;ome few Experiments of pre&s;erving tho&s;e Bodies, to make
them as permanent as Stone, and fewer of making them into a Sub&s;tance of
the like Nature.</P>
<P>The Third thing therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The thir$ pro|position confir|med.</NOTE> which I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, is, That the
concurring Cau&s;es to the&s;e Petrifactions &s;eem to be either &s;ome kind of petri|fying
Water, or el&s;e &s;ome &s;alin$ or &s;ulphureous Mixture, with the concur|rence
of Heat, from &s;ome &s;ubterrancous Fire or Earthquake, or el&s;e a very
long Continuation of tho&s;e Bodies under a great degree of Cold and Com|pre&s;&s;ion,
and Re&s;t. That petrifying Waters may be able to convert both
Animal and Vegetable Sub&s;tances into Stone, I could, be&s;ides &s;everal Tri|als
of my own, bring multitudes of Relations out of Natural Hi&s;torians: But
the&s;e are &s;o common almo&s;t in all Countries, and &s;o commonly taken notice of
by the Curious, that I need not in&s;tance. <HI>Cambden</HI> and <HI>Speed</HI> will tell you of
abundance here in <HI>England,</HI> as the <HI>Peak</HI> in <HI>Derby&s;htre,</HI> and in &s;everal other
&s;ubterraneous Caverns in <HI>England.</HI> The Water it &s;elf does, by degrees, pro|duce
&s;everal conical pendulous Bodies of Stone, &s;hap'd and hanging like Ici|cles
from the Roof of the Vault; and dropping on the bottom, it rai&s;es up al&s;o
conical Spires, which, by degrees, endeavour to meet the former pe$dulous
<HI>Stiriae.</HI> And indeed I have generally ob&s;erv'd it, that wherever there is a
Vault made with Lime under Ground, into which the Rain-Water &s;oaking
through, a pretty thickne&s;s of Ground, does at la&s;t penetrate through the
Arch; I have in &s;everal places, I &s;ay, ob&s;erv'd that that Water does incru|&s;tate
the Roof with Stone, and in many places of it generate &s;mall pen|dulous
Icicles. This Water I have found in a little time to incru&s;tate Sticks,
or the like Vegetable Sub&s;tances with Stone, and in &s;ome places to penetrate
into the Pores of the Wood, filling them up with &s;mall Cylinders of Stone.
This I have ob&s;erv'd al&s;o in divres of the Arches of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church,
which have been uncover'd and have lain open to the Rain, though there be
<PB N="294" REF="271">
no Earth for it to &s;oak through. And tho' I have never yet been able to pe|trify
a Stick throughout, yet I have now by me &s;everal pieces that retain so
perfectly all the Figure of Wood, and are yet so perfectly in all other pro|preties
Stone, that I find not the lea&s;t Rea&s;on of doubt to believe that tho&s;e
pieces have been actual Wood, having &s;till the Bark, the Clefts, the Knots,
the Grain, the Pores, and even tho&s;e too which, for their &s;malne&s;s, I have
el&s;ewhere call'd Micro&s;copical, tho' I confe&s;s &s;ome of the&s;e more perfect pieces
&s;eem to have been petrify'd from &s;ome more &s;ubtile and in&s;inuating petrify|ing
Water, than tho&s;e I newly mention'd, and 'tis not improbable but that
&s;ome Subterraneaous Steams and Heat may have contributad &s;omewhat to|wards
this Effect. But fir&s;t I &s;hall endeavour to make it probable, that the&s;e
petrify'd Bodies may have been placed in tho&s;e Parts where they are found,
by some kind of Transformation wrought on the Surface of the Earth, by
&s;ome Earth-quake: And to this end, I &s;hall by and by mention &s;ome &s;trange al|terations
that have been made by Earthquakes, after I have first made pro|bable
my fourth Conjecture.</P>
<P>The Fourth Pro|po&s;ition therefore to be explain'd and made probable is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fourth Propo&s;ition confir|med.</NOTE>
That Waters them&s;elves of divers Kinds, are, and may have been tran&s;muted
perfectly into a &s;tony Sub&s;tance, of a very permanent Con&s;titution, being
&s;carcely reducible again into Water by any Art yet commonly known. And
that divers other Liquid or Fluid Sub&s;tances have in tract of time &s;ettled
and congealed into much more hard, fixt, &s;olid and permanent Forms than they
were of at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The probability of which Propo&s;ition may appear from the&s;e Particulars.</P>
<P>1. That almo&s;t in all Streams and running Waters there is to be found
great quantity of Sand at the bottom, many of which Sands both by their Fi|gure
in the Micro&s;cope, and tran&s;parently, &s;eem to have been generated out
of the Water.</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t. Arg.</NOTE> I &s;ay, That their tran&s;parency which they di&s;cover in the Micro|&s;cope
is an Argument, becau&s;e I believe there is no tran&s;parent Body in the
World that has not been redue'd to that Con&s;titution by being &s;ome ways or
other made fluid, nor can I indeed imagine how there &s;hould be any. All
Bodies, made tran&s;parent by Art, mu&s;t be reduc'd into that Form fir&s;t; and
therefore 'tis not unlikely but that Nature may take the &s;ame Cour&s;e; but this
as only probable I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on. Next, I &s;ay, that the Figures of di|ver&s;e
of them in the Micro&s;cope di&s;cover the &s;ame things; for I have &s;een
multitudes of them curiou&s;ly wrought and figured like Cry&s;tal or Diamonds,
and I cannot imagine by what other In&s;trument Nature &s;hould thus cut them,
&s;ave by Cry&s;talizing them out of a Liquid or Fluid Body, and that way we
find her to work in the formation of all tho&s;e curious regular Figures of Salts,
and the Vitriols (as I may call them) of Metals and divers other Bodies, of
which Chymi&s;try affords many In&s;tances. Sea-Salt and Salgem chry&s;tylizeth
into Cubes or four-&s;ided Parrallelipipeds; Niter into triangular and hexangular
Pri&s;ms. Alume into Octoedrons, Vitriols into various kinds of Figures, ac|cording
to the various kinds of Metals di&s;&s;olved, and the various <HI>Men&s;trua.</HI>
di&s;&s;olving them; Tartars al&s;o, and Candyings of Vegetables are figured into
their various regular Shapes from the &s;ame Method and Principle. And in truth,
in the formation of any Body out of this mineral Kingdom, who&s;e Origine
we are able to examine, we may find that Nature, fir&s;t reduces the Bodies to
be wrought on into a liquid or &s;oft Sub&s;tance, and afterwards forms and
&s;hapes it into this or that Figure. But this Argument drawn from the Sand,
found in all running Streams, I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on, becau&s;e &s;ome imagine it
to be only wa&s;ht off from the Land and Shores the River pa&s;&s;es over, and
perpaps much of it may: But yet that Sand may be made of clear Wa|ter,
this &s;econd Argument will manife&s;t, and that is this:</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="272">
That 'tis a u&s;ual Experiment in the making of Salt in the Salterns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d. Arg.</NOTE> by
the boyling up, or evaporating away the fre&s;her part of the Sea-water, to
collect great quantities of Sand at each corner of the Boyler; which, after
it has been well wa&s;ht with fre&s;h Water, is, in all particulars, a perfect
Sand; and yet the Water is &s;o order'd before it is put into the Boyler, that
nothing of Sand or Dregs can enter with it, the B$$ne being fir&s;t &s;uffer'd to
&s;tand a good while and &s;ettle in a very large Fat, &s;o that all the Sand and
Dregs may &s;ink to the bottom; after which, the clearer Water at the
top is drawn off, and &s;uffer'd to run into the Boyler. 'Tis not impo&s;&s;ible,
perhaps, but that Sub&s;tance which made this Sand, might be di&s;&s;olved in
Water, and afterwards by evaparation coagulated; which, if &s;o, makes not at
all again&s;t, but rather argues &s;trongly for my fourth Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>But that the other Solution is &s;omething more probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d. <HI>Arg</HI></NOTE> namely, That
'tis made out of the very Sub&s;tance of the Water it&s;elf, this third Argu|ment
will make probable; and that is, that any Water of what kind &s;oever,
tho' never &s;o clear and in&s;ipid, may, by frequent Di&s;tillations, be all of it
perfectly tran&s;mitted into a white in&s;ipid Calx not again di&s;&s;olvable in Wa|ter,
and in nothing differing from the Sub&s;tance of Stone; this I have been
a&s;&s;ured by an eminent Phy&s;ician, who has divers times made tryal of it with
the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s. If therefore the whole Body of any Water may, by &s;o ea&s;y
an Operation in &s;o very &s;hort a time, be tran&s;muted into a &s;tony Sub&s;tance,
what may not Nature do that can take her own time, and knows be&s;t how
to make u&s;e of her own Principles?</P>
<P>But 4<HI>thy.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">4th. <HI>Arg.</HI></NOTE> we have many In&s;tances by which we are a&s;&s;ured that Nature realy
does change Water into Stone, both by forming in a little time con&s;idera|ble

of Caves and &s;ubterraneous Vaults, of which we have very many In&s;tances
here in <HI>England;</HI> as to name one for all at the Peak in <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> the pendu|lous

<P>And 5<HI>thy.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">5th. <HI>Arg</HI></NOTE> there are divers other Waters which we need not &s;eek after in

almo&s;t in all places, that I need not in&s;tance in any; only I cannot pa&s;s
by one, which is taken notice of by <HI>Kircher</HI> in his <HI>Mundus Subterraneus,</HI> being
Ob&s;ervations made by him&s;elf, and it has in it two Circum&s;tances very con|&s;iderable;
the fir&s;t is, That Vegetables &s;hould grow &s;o plentifully in a very
hot Water. The &s;econd, that only &s;uch Herbs as grew in it, and not &s;uch
as were Steeped in it, will perfectly, after drying, be turned into Stone, of
which I &s;hall afterwards have occa&s;ion to make more u&s;e. I &s;hall give the Hi&s;tory

I have ob&s;erv'd in petrify'd Bodies, as I &s;hall indeavour hereafter to &s;hew,

<PB N="296" REF="273">
lines al&s;o, and petrify'd Mu&s;hromes, of each of which I have examined a
very great variety. But this only by the by.</P>
<P><HI>6thly.</HI> Therefore 'tis ob&s;ervable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th <HI>Arg.</HI></NOTE> that the&s;e petrifying Waters are for the
mo&s;t part very clear and limpid; &s;o that to the Sight 'tis not di&s;tingui&s;hable
from other Water: But only by the Effects, and therefore by the newly
mention'd Ob&s;ervations of <HI>Kircher,</HI> we find that Vegetables, that upon dry|ing
turn'd into Stone; whil&s;t green and growing flouri&s;hed and &s;pread fa&s;ter
than others; &s;o that the petrifying Sub&s;tance pa&s;t through the fine&s;t and
clo&s;e&s;t Pores of the living Vegetables, and therefore mu&s;t certainly be very
intimately mixt with the Water that could not be &s;eparated by &s;o fine and
curious Strainers.</P>

parts of the Earth, &s;uch Waters will be intirely converted into Stone.
Of this kind there are &s;everal Hi&s;tories in the newly-mention'd Book, which
I pa&s;s over, and &s;hall only take notice of one for all, and that is in an Ac|count

<P>And again, Page 185. of the &s;ame, from another Prefect, of the Emperial
Mines in <HI>Hungary</HI> in an&s;wer to the &s;ame Query, we have this Account. <HI>Reperi|tur

quam in mineris Lapidibus &s;iliceis copio&s;is, &amp; cuprum cum argento continentibus.</HI>
Whence I am apt to think, and I have many Ob&s;ervations and Arguments to
confirm my Conjecture,</P>
<P>That <HI>8thly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">8th. <HI>Arg.</HI></NOTE> All kinds of <HI>Talk</HI> and <HI>Spar,</HI> mo&s;t <HI>Ores</HI> and <HI>Marcha&s;ites: Alu|men
Plumeum, &amp; Asbe&s;tus; Fluores, Cry&s;talls,</HI> Corni&s;h-<HI>Diamonds, Amethy&s;ts</HI>
and divers other figured Mineral Bodies, may be generated from their Cry|&s;talization,
or Coagulation, out of &s;ome Mineral Waters.</P>
<P>And to make it yet more probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th. <HI>Arg.</HI></NOTE> I could in the 9th place add divers
Experiments, by which &s;everal of the&s;e Concretes may be in a &s;hort time made
artificially by &s;everal Chymical Operations, which would very much illu&s;trate
the former Doctrin. But I hope what I have mention'd may &s;uffice to make
the fourth Propo&s;ition probable, that Waters of divers kinds may be turned
in time to Stone, without being reducible again to Water by any Art yet
commonly known, which being granted, my</P>
<P>Fifth Propo&s;ition will follow of con&s;equence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fifth Pro|position prov|ed.</NOTE> <HI>viv.</HI> That divers other fluid
Sub&s;tances, have, after long continuance of re&s;t, &s;ettled and congealed into
much more hard and permanent Sub&s;tances: For if Water it &s;elf may be &s;o
changed and metamorpho&s;ed, which &s;eems the farthe&s;t removed from the
nature of a &s;olid Body, certainly tho&s;e which are nearer to that Nature, and
are mixt with &s;uch Waters, will more ea&s;ily be coagulated: I &s;hall not there|fore
any farther in&s;i&s;t on the Proof of this, than only to mention two Parti|culars,
and that becau&s;e we have almo&s;t every where &s;o many In&s;tances and
Experiments; and the fir&s;t is that of <HI>Pliny</HI> in the 13th Chap. of the 35th
Book of his Natural Hi&s;tory, in all which Chapter he gives us divers In&s;tances
of &s;everal kinds of Earth, which, by the Sea-water and Air, converted into
into &s;olid and hard Stones; his Words are the&s;e: <HI>Verum &amp; ip&s;ius Terrae &s;unt
alia &s;egmenta. Quis enim &s;atis miretur pe&s;&s;imam ejus partem ideo&abque; pulverem appel|$$uam

in Saxa, &amp;c.</HI> to the end of the Chapter he goes on to relate divers Places
where Earths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are turned into Stones. Al&s;o in the 10th Chapter of the
of the 31&s;t Book, &s;peaking of the Nature and Kinds of Niter, he tells about
the middle of the Chapter. <HI>Nitrariae egregiae Aegyptiis nam circa Naucratim &amp;

<P>The Second is an Ob&s;ervation of my own, which I have often taken notice
of, and lately examined very diligently, which will much confirm the&s;e Hi|&s;tories
of <HI>Pliny,</HI> and this my pre&s;ent Hypothe&s;is; and that is a Part of the
Ob&s;ervation I have already mentioned, which I made upon the We&s;tern Shore
of the I&s;le of <HI>Wight.</HI> I ob&s;erved a Cliff of a pretty height, which, by the con|&s;tant
wa&s;hing of the Water at the bottom of it, is continually, e&s;pecially af|ter
Fro&s;ts and great Rains, foundering and tumbling down into the Sea un|derneath
it. Along the Shore underneath this Cliff, are a great number of
Rocks and large Stones confu&s;edly placed, &s;ome covered, others quite out of
the Water; all which Rocks I found to be compounded of Sand and Clay, and
Shells, and &s;uch kind of Stones, as the Shore was covered with. Examining
the Hardne&s;s of &s;ome that lay as far into the Water as the Low-Water-mark,
I found them to be altogether as hard, if not much harder than <HI>Portland</HI> or
<HI>Purbeck</HI>-&s;tone: Others of them that lay not &s;o far into the Sea, I found much
fo&s;ter, as having in probability not been &s;o long expo&s;ed to the Vici&s;&s;itudes
of the Tides: Others of them I found &s;o very &s;oft, that I could ea&s;ily with
my Foot cru&s;h them, and make Impre&s;&s;ions into them, and could thru&s;t a
Walking-&s;tick I had in my Hand a great depth into them: Others that had
been but newly foundered down, were yet more &s;oft, as having been &s;carce
wa&s;h'd by the Salt Water. All the&s;e were perfectly of the &s;ame Sub&s;tance
with the Cliff, from whence they had manife&s;tly tumbled, and con&s;i&s;ted of
Layers of Shells, Sand, Clay, Gravel, Earth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and from all the Cir|cum&s;tances
I could examine, I do judge them to have been the Parts of the
Neigbouring Cliff foundered down, and rowl'd and wa&s;h'd by degrees into
the Sea; and, by the petrifying Power of the Salt Water, converted into
perfect hard compacted Stones. I have likewi&s;e &s;ince ob&s;erved the like <HI>Phae|nomena</HI>
on other Shores. And I doubt not but any inqui&s;itive Naturali&s;t may
find infinite of the like In&s;tances all along the Coa&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> and other
Countries where there are &s;uch kind of foundering Cliffs. I &s;hall not now
mention the great Quantities of toothed Spar, which I ob&s;erved to be cry&s;tal|lized
upon the &s;ides of the&s;e Rocks, which &s;eem'd to have been nothing el&s;e
but the meer cry&s;tallizing or &s;hooting of &s;ome kind of Water, which was
pre&s;s'd or aro&s;e out of the&s;e coagulating Stones; For the Hi&s;tory of the&s;e
kinds of figured Stones belong more properly to another Di&s;cour&s;e; namely,
of the Natural Geometrical Figures, ob&s;ervable in Oares, Minerals, Spars,
Talk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of which el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>One In&s;tance more I cannot omit, as being the mo&s;t ob&s;ervable of any I
have yet heard of; and that is, (Dr. <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI>'s Relation) of a certain' Place at
<HI>Alp&s;ly</HI> in <HI>Bedford&s;hire,</HI> where there is a corner of a certain Field, that doth per|fectly
turn Wood and divers other Sub&s;tances in a very &s;hort time into Stone
as hard as a Flint or Agat. A Piece of this kind I &s;aw, affirm'd to have been
there buried, which the Per&s;on that buried it had &s;hot &s;mall Shots of Lead
into; the whole Sub&s;tance of the Wood, Bark and Pith, together with the
Leaden Shot it &s;elf, was perfectly turn'd to a Stone as hard as any Agat, and
yet retain'd its perfect Shape and Form; and the Lead remain'd round, and
in its place, but much harder than any Iron. Of this I am promi&s;ed a Sam|ple,
but have not yet received it.</P>
<P>But to &s;pend no more time, on the proof of that of which we have almo&s;t
every where In&s;tances, divers of which I have already mention'd, I &s;hall pro|ceed
to the 6th Propo&s;ition; which is, That a great Part of the Surface of the
<PB N="298" REF="275" MS="Y">
Earth hath been &s;ince the Creation transform'd, and made of another Na|ture:
that is, many Parts which have been Sea are now Land, and others that
have been Land are now Sea&punc; many of the Mountains have been Vales, and
the Vales Mountains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Fot the proving of which Propo&s;ition, I &s;hall not need to produce any other
Arguments, be&s;ides the repeating what I find &s;et down by divers Natural
Hi&s;torians, concerning the prodigious Effects that have been produced by
Earthquakes on the &s;uperficial Parts of the Earth; becau&s;e they &s;eem to me
to have been the chief Efficients which have tran&s;ported the&s;e petrify'd Bo|dies,
Shells, Woods, Animal Sub&s;tances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and left them in &s;ome Parts
of the Earth, as are no other ways likely to have been the Places wherein &s;uch
Sub&s;tances &s;hould be produced; they being u&s;ually either rai&s;ed a great way
above the level Surface of the Earth, on the Tops of high Hills, or el&s;e buried
a great way beneath that Surface in the lower Valleys: For who can imagine
that Oy&s;ters, Mu&s;cles, and Periwinkles, and the like Shell-fi&s;h, &s;hould ever
have had their Habitation on the Tops of the Mountain <HI>Cauca&s;us?</HI> Which is
by divers of our Geographers accounted as high in its perpendicular Altitude,
as any Mountain in the yet known World; and yet <HI>Olearius</HI> affords us a ve|ry
con&s;iderable Hi&s;tory to this purpo&s;e of his own Ob&s;ervation, which I &s;hall
hereafter have occa&s;ion to relate, and examine more particularly. Or to come
a little nearer home, who could imagine that Oy&s;ters, <HI>Echini,</HI> and &s;ome other
Shell-fi&s;h, &s;hould heretofore have lived at the tops of the <HI>Alps, Appennine,</HI>
and <HI>Pyrenian</HI> Mountains, all which abound with great &s;tore of &s;everal &s;orts
of Shells; nay, yet nearer at the tops of &s;ome of the highe&s;t in <HI>Cornwal</HI> and
<HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> where I have been informed by Per&s;ons who&s;e Te&s;timony I cannot
in the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pect, that they have taken up divers, and &s;een great Quantities of
them? And to come yet nearer, who can imagine Oy&s;ters to have lived on
the Tops of &s;ome Hills near <HI>Ban&s;tead-Downs</HI> in <HI>Surry?</HI> Where there have beentime
out of Mind, and are &s;till to this day found divers Shells of Oy&s;ters,
both on the uppermo&s;t Surface, and buried likewi&s;e under the Surface of the
Earth, as I was lately informed by &s;everal very worthy Per&s;ons living near
tho&s;e Places, and as I my &s;elf had the Opportunity to ob&s;erve and collect.</P>
<P>To proceed then to the Effects of Earthquakes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Effects of Earthquakes.</NOTE> we find in Hi&s;tories Four
Sorts or <HI>Genus's</HI> to have been performed by them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is the rai&s;ing of the &s;uperficial Parts of the Earth above their
former Level: and under this Head there are Four Species.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fir&s;t &s;ort or Genus of Effects.</NOTE> The 1&s;t is the
rai&s;ing of a con&s;iderable Part of a Country, which before lay level with the
Sea, and making it lye many Feet, nay, &s;ometimes many Fathoms above its
former height. A 2d is the rai&s;ing of a con&s;iderable part of the bottom of
the Sea, and making it lye above the Surface of the Water, by which means
divers I&s;lands have been generated and produced. A 3d Species is the
rai&s;ing of very con&s;iderable Mountains out of a plain and level Country. And
a 4th Species is the rai&s;ing of the Parts of the Earth by the throwing on of
a great Acce&s;s of new Earth, and $or burying the former Surface under a co|vering
of new Earth many Fathoms thick.</P>
<P>A second &s;ort of of Effects perform'd by Earthquakes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second sort or Genus of Ef|fects.</NOTE> is the depre&s;&s;ion or
&s;inking of the Parts of the Earth's Surface below the former Level. Under
this Head are al&s;o comprized four di&s;tinct Species, which are directly con|trary
to the four la&s;t named.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> is a &s;inking of &s;ome Part of the Surface of the Earth, lying a good
way within the Land, and converting it into a Lake of an almo&s;t unmea&s;urable depth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second,</HI> is the &s;inking of a con&s;iderable Part of the plain Land, near
the Sea, below its former Level, and &s;o &s;uffering the Sea to come in and over|flow
it, being laid lower than the Surface of the next adjoining Sea.</P>
<P>A <HI>Third</HI> is the &s;inking of the Parts of the bottom of the Sea much lower,
and creating therein va&s;t <HI>Vorages</HI> and <HI>Aby&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="276" MS="Y">
A <HI>Fourth,</HI> is the making bare, or uncovering of divers Parts of the Earth,
which were before a good way below the Surface; and this either by &s;uddenly
throwing away the&s;e upper Parts by &s;ome &s;ubterraneous Motion, or el&s;e by
wa&s;hing them away by &s;ome kind of Eruption of Waters from unu&s;ual Places,
vomited out by &s;ome Earthquake.</P>
<P>A Third &s;ort of Effects produced by Earthquakes, are the Subver&s;ions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Third, Sort or <HI>Genus</HI> of Ef|fects.</NOTE> Con|ver&s;ions,
and Tran&s;po&s;itions of the Parts of the Earth.</P>
<P>A Fourth &s;ort of <HI>Effects,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fourth Sort or</HI> Genus <HI>of Ef|fects.</HI></NOTE> are <HI>Liquefaction. Baking, Calcining, Petrifaction,
Transformation, Sublimation, Di&s;tillation,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t therefore of the Effects of Earthquakes, which I but now named,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Fir&s;t Spe|cies of Effects under the fir&s;t</HI> Genus <HI>or Sort.</HI></NOTE>
was, that divers Parts of the Surface of the Earth which lay before, either be|low
or level with the Sea, have been rai&s;ed a good height above that Level
by Earthquakes. Of this <HI>Pliny</HI> gives us &s;everal In&s;tances in the 85th Chap|ter
of the 2d Book of his Natural Hi&s;tory, <HI>Eadem na&s;centium Cau&s;a terrarum

<P><HI>Meander,</HI> and <HI>Sandys</HI> al&s;o, in his Travels thro' <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Parts of the
<HI>Levant,</HI> gives this In&s;tance, <HI>pag.</HI> 277. &s;peaking of the new Mountain, which
was produced in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> in the Year 1538. <HI>The Lake</HI> Lucri|nus,

but is how no other than a little &s;edgy Pla&s;h, choaked up by the horrible and a&s;toni&s;h|ing
Eruption of the new Mountain, whereof, as oft as I think, I am apt to credit
what&s;oever is wonderful. For who in</HI> Italy, &s;ays he, <HI>knows not, or who el&s;ewhere
will believe, that a Mountam &s;hould ari&s;e partly out of a Lake, and partly out of the
Sea in one Day and a Night, to &s;uch a height, as to contend, in Altitude with the high
Mountains adjoining.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In the Year of our Lord 1538 on the 29th of</HI> September, <HI>when for certain Days
foregoing, the Country thereabouts was &s;o vext with perpetual Earthquakes, as no
one Hou&s;e was le$t &s;o intire, as not to expect immediate Ruine, after that the Sea
had retired 200 Paces from the Shore, leaving abundance of Fi&s;h with Springs of
Fre&s;h Water ri&s;ing at the bottom, this Mountain v$&s;ibly a&s;cended about the &s;econd
Hour of the Night,</HI> and &s;o forwards. And again, <HI>pag.</HI> 281, &s;peaking of the
&s;ame Place, he &s;ays, <HI>The Sea was accu&s;tomed, when urged with Storms to flow
in thro' the Lake,</HI> Luc$inus <HI>driving Fi&s;hes in with it; but now not only that Pa&s;&s;age,
but a Part of</HI> Avernus <HI>it &s;elf is choaked by the Mountain.</HI> In which Hi&s;tories I
take notice only of the&s;e two Particulars at pre&s;ent. Fir&s;t, That that Part
of the Land which lyes between <HI>Lucrinus</HI> and the Sea, that was oft-times be|fore
overflowed by the Sea, &s;ince this Earthquake, has been &s;o far rai&s;ed, as
that now &s;uch Effects are no longer to be found. To confirm the ri&s;ing of
which the more, the other Circum&s;tance of the Sea's departing from the
Shore 200 Paces does much contribute. But not to in&s;i&s;t on this, Mr. <HI>Chil|dry</HI>
in his <HI>Britannia B$conica,</HI> a Book very u&s;e&s;ul in its Kind, being a Collection
of All the Natural Hi&s;tory of the I&s;lands of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to be met with in
<HI>Cambden,</HI> or <HI>Speed,</HI> and &s;ome other Hi&s;torians, together with &s;uch of his own
as he had opportunity to ob&s;erve, relates to us many con&s;iderable Pa&s;&s;ages to
this purpo&s;e. In his Hi&s;tory of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> he &s;aith, That near St. <HI>Benet</HI>'s in the
<HI>Holm,</HI> are perfect Cockles and Periwinkles &s;ometimes digg'd up out of the
Earth, which makes &s;ome think it was formerly overflow'd by the Sea. The
Fenny Grounds al&s;o of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> &s;eem to have proceeded from
the ri&s;ing of the Ground; and tho&s;e in <HI>Angle&s;y,</HI> where lopp'd Trees are now
dug up with the perfect Strokes of the Ax remaining on them, &s;eem to have
<PB N="300" REF="277">
been fir&s;t &s;unk under Water, then overturn'd and buried in their own Earth,
and afterwards the whole Earth &s;eems to have been rai&s;ed again to its for|mer
height. Of the rai&s;ing of the Surface of the Earth, by the overflowings
and &s;topping of Rivers and Waters, I &s;hall afterwards &s;peak.</P>
<P><HI>Lin&s;choten</HI> gives us a Relation of the like Effects of an Earthquake that
hapned in the <HI>Terceras.</HI> The Relation, as I &s;ind it epitomiz'd by <HI>Purchas</HI> in
The 1677 Page of the 4th Part of his <HI>Pilgrims,</HI> is this:, In <HI>July; Anno</HI> 1591.
&startq;there happen'd an Earthquake in the I&s;land of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> which lyeth from
<HI>Tercera</HI> South-East about 28 Miles, an I&s;land 20 Miles long, and full of
Towns, which continued from <HI>July</HI> 26. to <HI>Aug.</HI> 12, in which time none dur&s;t
&s;tay within his Hou&s;e, but fled into the Fields, fa&s;ting and praying with
great Sorrow, for that many of their Hou&s;es fell down, and a Town, called
<HI>Villa Franca,</HI> was almo&s;t razed to the Ground, all the Cloy&s;ters and Hou&s;es
&s;haken to the Earth, and therein People &s;lain. <HI>The Land in &s;ome Places ro&s;e
up,</HI> and the Clifts removed from one Place to another, and &s;ome Hills were
defaced and made even with the Ground. The Earthquake was &s;o &s;trong,
that the Ships that lay in the Road, and in the Sea, &s;haked as if the World
would have turn'd round. There &s;prang al&s;o a Fountain out of the Earth,
from whence for the &s;pace of four Days there flow'd a mo&s;t clear Water, and
after that it cea&s;ed. At the &s;ame time they heard &s;uch Thunder and Noi&s;e
under the Earth, as if all the Devils had been a&s;&s;embled together at that
Place, wherewith many dy'd for fear. The I&s;land of <HI>Tercera</HI> &s;hook four times
together, &s;o tha$ it &s;eem'd to turn about; but there happen'd no other Mi&s;|fortune
unto it. Earthquakes are common in tho&s;e I&s;lands: For about 20
Years pa&s;t there happen'd another Earthquake, when a high Hill that lyeth
by the &s;ame Town <HI>Villa Franca,</HI> fell half down, and covered all the Town with
Earth, and killed many Men.&endq; I have tran&s;cribed here once for all the whole
Relation, becau&s;e there are many other con&s;iderable Circum&s;tances in it be|&s;ides
the ri&s;ing of the Earth, which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to refer to, under
others of the Heads or Propo&s;itions to be proved, and therefore &s;hall not need
repetition. Two other Relations I find collected by <HI>Purchas,</HI> confirming this
and &s;everal of the other Propo&s;itions: The one is that of <HI>Dithmar Blefken's,</HI> in
his Hi&s;tory of <HI>I&s;land,</HI> Page 648 of the 3d Part of his <HI>Pilgrims.</HI> &startq;On the 29th
of <HI>November</HI> about Midnight, in the Sea, there appear'd a Flame near <HI>Hecla,</HI>
which gave Light to the whole I&s;land: An hour after the whole I&s;land trem|bled,
as it would have been moved out of the Place: After the Earthquake
follow'd a horrible Crack, that if all warlike Ordnance had been di&s;charg'd
it had beta nothing to this Terror. It was known afterwards that <HI>the Sea
went back two Leagues in that Place, and remainend dry.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>A Second Hi&s;tory <HI>Purchas</HI> has collected out of the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Jo&s;eph Aco&s;ta</HI>
of the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> Page 940 of the 3d Part: omitting for the pre&s;ent divers
other Circum&s;tances he takes notice of, I &s;hall only mention that of the re|ceding
of the Sea. &startq;Upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Chile,</HI> (&s;ays he) I remember not well
in what Year, there was &s;o terrible an Earthquake, as it overturn'd whole
Mountains, and thereby &s;topt the Cour&s;e of Rivers, which it converted into
Lakes: It beat down Towns, and &s;lew a great number of People, cau&s;ing the
Sea to leave her Place &s;ome Leagues, &s;o as the Ships remain'd on dry Ground
$ar from the ordinary Road, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&endq; An Example &s;omewhat like this hap|pen'd
lately in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> as I was inform'd by a Letter &s;ent thence to
Mr. <HI>D.</HI> on <HI>London-Bridge.</HI> The thing in &s;hort was this: At a Place, about

<HI>Vulcano</HI> is &s;aid to have fir&s;t appear'd above Water about the time that <HI>Scipio

for about twenty eight Years &s;ince, an I&s;land was made among the
<HI>Azores</HI> by an Eruption of Fire; of which divers have related the Story.
But $ <HI>Kircher</HI> in his <HI>Mundus Subterraneus,</HI> from the Relation of the Je&s;uits, has
added the mo&s;t particular one. Having &s;poken of the exceeding height of
the Pike of <HI>Teneriff</HI> in the <HI>Canaries,</HI> and of the Eruptions of Fire in it, and
the hot Springs found about it, he adds, that in the Azores al&s;o there are
found places having almo&s;t the &s;ame Proprieties. The <HI>Pico de Fayal de Santo
Gregorio,</HI> being almo&s;t of equal hight, and St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s I&s;land having here|tofore
had &s;everal Vulcans, and having been troubled with many Earth|quakes,
and very notably about thirty eight Years &s;ince, wherein all the
l&s;land was &s;o terribly &s;haken, that the utter Ruin and Submer&s;ion of the
whole was feared. The Hi&s;tory of which, in &s;hort, is this; &startq;That <HI>June</HI> 26.
1638. the whole I&s;land began to be &s;haken with Earthquakes for eight days,
&s;o that the Inhabitants left Cities, Ca&s;tles and Hou&s;es, and dwelt in the
Fields, but e&s;pecially tho&s;e of a Place call'd <HI>Vargen</HI> where the Motion was
more violent. After which Earthquake, this Prodigy followed; At a place of
the Sea, where Fi&s;her-men us'd to fi&s;h in Summer, becau&s;e of the great
abundance of Fi&s;h there caught, call'd <HI>La Femera,</HI> about <HI>6</HI> Miles from <HI>Pico
Delle Carmerine</HI> upon the fir&s;t <HI>Sunday</HI> in <HI>July,</HI> a &s;ubterraneous Fire, notwith|&s;tanding
the weight and depth of the Sea in that Place, which was 120 Foot,
as the Fi&s;hermen had often before that found by &s;ounding, and the multi|tude
of Waters which one would have thought &s;ufficient to have quenched
the Fire: A &s;ubterraneous Fire, I &s;ay, broke out with a mo&s;t unexpre&s;&s;ible
violence, carrying up into the Clouds with it Water, Sand, Earth, Stones,
and other va&s;t great bulks of Bodies; which to the &s;ad Spectators, at a di|&s;tance,
appear'd like Flocks of Wool or Cotton, and falling back on the Sur|face
of the Water look'd like Froth. The Space of this Eruption was about
as big as a Space of Land, that might well be &s;own by two Bu&s;hels of Grain.
By great Providence the Wind blew from the Land; otherwi&s;e the whole
I&s;land would, in all probability, have peri&s;hed by the mercile&s;s Rage of the&s;e
devouring Flames, &s;uch va&s;t bulks of Stone were thrown up into the Air,
about the height to &s;eeming of three Pikes Lengths, that one would rather
think them Mountains than Rocks. And which added further Horror to
this dreadful Sight, was, that the&s;e Mountains returning again, often met
with others a&s;cending or being thrown up, and were thereby da&s;ht into a
1000 Pieces; divers of which Pieces being afterwards taken up and brui&s;ed,
ea&s;ily turn'd into a black &s;hining Sand. Out of the great multitude and va|riety
of the&s;e va&s;t rejected Bodies, and the immen&s;e heaps of Rocks and Stones,
after a while was form'd a new I&s;land out of the main Ocean, which at fir&s;t
was not above 5 Furlongs over; but after a while, by daily acce&s;&s;es new
Matter, it increa&s;ed after 14 Days to an I&s;land of 5 Miles over. From this
Eruption, &s;o great a quantity of Fi&s;h was de&s;troy'd and thrown upon the next
adjoining I&s;land, that 8 of the bigge&s;t <HI>Indian</HI> Galeons would not be &s;uffici|ent
to contain them; which the Inhabitants fearing, left the Stink of them
<PB N="302" REF="279">
might create a Plague, for, 18 Miles round collected and buried in deep Pits.
The Stink of the Brim&s;tone was plainly &s;melt at 24 Miles di&s;tance. Thus
far he.&endq; But we have one In&s;tance more of the Generation of an I&s;land out
of the bottom of the Sea, by an Eruption; which becau&s;e it happen'd very
lately, namely in 1650, and near an I&s;land in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> which <HI>Pliny</HI>
relates to have been heretofore after the &s;ame manner produced, I &s;hall in
&s;hort relate, as it is more largely recorded by <HI>Kircker,</HI> in his <HI>Mundus Subter|raneus,</HI>
from the Mouth of Father <HI>Franci&s;cus Riccardus,</HI> a Je&s;uit, who was at
the &s;ame time in the adjoining I&s;land, and was an Eye-witne&s;s of all the
<HI>Phaenomena.</HI></P>
<P>&startq;From the 24th of <HI>September</HI> to the 9th of <HI>October,</HI> 1650, the I&s;land of <HI>San|terinum</HI>
formerly call'd by <HI>Pliny Thera,</HI> was dreadfully &s;haken with Earth|quakes,
&s;o that the Inhabitants expected nothing but utter ruine; and were
yet more amazed by a horrid Eruption of Fire out of the bottom of the
Sea, about 4 Miles to the Ea&s;tward of the I&s;land: Before which the Water
of the Place was rais'd above 30 Cubits perpendicularly, (I &s;uppp&s;e he means
as to appearance from the I&s;land, otherwi&s;e 'tis but very little) which
Wave &s;preading it &s;elf round every way, overturn'd every thing it met, de|&s;troying
Ships and Galleys in the Harbour of <HI>Candle,</HI> which was four &s;core
Miles di&s;tant. The Eruption fill'd the Air with A&s;hes and horrible &s;ul|phureous
Stinks, and dreadful Lightnings and Thunders &s;ucceeded. All
things in the I&s;land were covered with a yellow &s;ulphureous Cru&s;t, and the
People almo&s;t blinded as well as choak'd. Multitudes of Pumice, and other
Stones were thrown up, and carried as far as <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and to Places
at a very great di&s;tance. The Force of this Eruption was greate&s;t the
two fir&s;t Months, when all the Neighbouring Sea &s;eem'd to boil, and the
<HI>Vulcan</HI> continually vomited up Fire-balls. Upon the turning of the Wind,
great Mi&s;chief was done in the I&s;land of <HI>Santerinum,</HI> many Bea&s;ts and Birds
were kill'd: And on the 29th of <HI>October,</HI> and 4th of <HI>November,</HI> about 50
Men were kill'd by it. The other four Months it la&s;ted, tho' much abated
of its former Fiercene&s;s, yet it &s;till ca&s;t up Stone, and &s;eem'd to en|deavour
the making of a New I&s;land, which though it do not yet perfectly
appear above Water, yet 'tis cover'd but 8 Foot by the Water; and the
bubbling of the Water &s;eems to &s;peak another Eruption, that may in time
fini&s;h Nature's Birth.&endq; And in the Year he writ this, which he &s;ays was
1656, there was an extraordinary boiling of the Sea, and an Eruption of
Smoke. And though our Natural Hi&s;torians have been very &s;carce in the
World, and con&s;equently &s;uch Hi&s;tories are very few; yet there has been no
Age wherein &s;uch Hi&s;torians have liv'd, but has afforded them an Example
of such Effects of Earthquakes. And I doubt not, but had the World been
always furni&s;ht with &s;uch Hi&s;torians as had been inqui&s;itive and knowing, we
&s;hould have &s;ound not only <HI>Thera</HI> or <HI>Santerinum,</HI> and <HI>Valcano</HI> and <HI>Delos,</HI> and
that in the <HI>Azores,</HI> and one lately in the <HI>Canaries,</HI> but a very great part of the
I&s;lands of the whole World to have been rais'd out of the Sea, or &s;eparated
from the Land by Earthquakes: for which Opinion I &s;hall afterwards relate
&s;everal Ob&s;ervations both of my own and others, which &s;eem to afford pro|bable
Arguments.</P>
<P>But to proceed to the third Kind or Species of Effects produced by Earth|quakes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Species under the fir&s;t <HI>Genus</HI> of Effects.</NOTE>
which is the rai&s;ing very con&s;iderable Mountains out of Plains. Of
this I &s;hall add a few Instances; but none more notable, than that of the new
Mountain near <HI>Naples,</HI> which I &s;aid &s;omewhat before out of <HI>Sandys</HI>'s Travels.
In the Year 1538. <HI>Sep$emb.</HI> 29. this Mountain vi&s;ibly a&s;cended about the 2d
hour of the Night, with a hideous roaring, horribly vomiting Stones, and
&s;uch &s;tore of Cinders, as overwhelm$$'d all the Buildings there about, and the
&s;alubrious Baths of <HI>Tripergula,</HI> for &s;o many Ages celebrated, con&s;uming all
the Vines to A&s;hes, and killing Birds and Bea&s;ts, and frighting away all the
Inhabitants, who fled naked and de$iled through the dark: And has advanced
its top a Mile above the Ba&s;is: the Stones of it are &s;o light and pory, that
they will not &s;ink when thrown in the Sea. This new Mountain, when new
rais'd, had a number of I&s;&s;ues, at &s;ome of them &s;moking, and &s;ometimes $lamm|ing;
<PB N="303" REF="280">
at others di&s;gorging Rivulets of hot Water, keeping within a terrible
rumbling; and many peri&s;hed that ventured to de&s;cend into the hollowne&s;s
above. But that hollow at the top is at pre&s;ent an Orchard, and the Mountain
throughout bereft of its Terrors. &startq;It is reported, &s;aith <HI>Childrey,</HI> that in a
Pari&s;h by the Sea-&s;ide, not far from <HI>Axbridge</HI> in <HI>Somer &s;e$&s;hire,</HI> within the&s;e 50
Years, a Parcel of Land &s;well'd up like a Hill; but on a &s;udden clave a&s;un|der,
and fell down into he Earth, and in the place of it remains a great
Pool.&endq; Our Engli&s;h Chronicles &s;ay, at <HI>Oxe$hal,</HI> in the Bi&s;noprick of <HI>Dur|ham,</HI>
on <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> Day 1679, the Ground heav'd up aloft like a Tower, and
continued all that day immoveable, till Evening, and then fell with a horri|ble
noi&s;e, &s;inking into the Earth, and leaving three deep Pits, call'd Hell|Kettles.
<HI>Varenius</HI> tells us of a new Mountain likewi&s;e rai&s;ed in <HI>Java,</HI> in the
Year 1586, with the like Effects of tho&s;e I formerly named of the new Moun|tain
fir&s;t &s;haking the Earth, then heaving up and throwing up into the Air
the upper Parts of the Earth, afterwards the Rock and inner Parts, then fiery
Coals and Cinders, overwhelming the circumjacent Fields and Towns, and
killing above 10000 Men, and burning what was not overwhelmed. I have
not time to reckon up the multitude of In&s;tances I have met with in Authors,
&s;uch as <HI>Aetna</HI> in <HI>Sicily, Ve&s;uvius</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> one in <HI>Croatia,</HI> near the City <HI>Valonia,</HI>
the <HI>Pike</HI> in <HI>Tenarif,</HI> and the <HI>Pike</HI> in the <HI>Azores, Hecla, Helga,</HI> and another in
<HI>I&s;land:</HI> The Mount <HI>Gonnapi</HI> in one of the I&s;lands of <HI>Banda,</HI> which made
an horrid Eruption at the &s;ame time with that in <HI>Java:</HI> The Mount <HI>Bala|vane</HI>
in <HI>Sumatra:</HI> Others in the <HI>Molucca</HI> I&s;lands, in <HI>China, Japan,</HI> and the <HI>Phi|lippines,</HI>
and in &s;ome of the <HI>Maurician</HI> I&s;lands, and &s;everal other Parts of the
<HI>Ea&s;t Indies.</HI> In the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> al&s;o we have multitudes of Examples, &s;everal
in <HI>Nicaragua,</HI> and all along the Ledge of Mountains in <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chile,</HI> and
in <HI>New Spain</HI> and <HI>Mexico.</HI> In the I&s;lands of <HI>Papoys,</HI> di&s;cover'd by <HI>Le Mair,</HI>
joining to the South Continent in <HI>Mar Del Zur:</HI> All which are as &s;o many
&s;hining Torches to direct us in the &s;earch after this Truth. There are many
other In&s;tances of Mountains, that have but lately as it were left to burn,
and are cover'd with Wood and grown fruitful. So the new Mountain I for|merly
mention'd, has an Orchard growing where the Fire at fir&s;t $lamed.
Another in the I&s;land <HI>Qutimeda,</HI> near the River <HI>Plat</HI> in <HI>Bra&s;ill;</HI> The I&s;lands
al&s;o of St. <HI>Helena,</HI> and <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> di&s;covered by the great plenty of Cinders,
and the Fa&s;hions of the Hills to have formerly contained <HI>Vulcanoes,</HI> and pro|bably
were at fir&s;t made by &s;ome &s;ubterraneous Eruption, as indeed mo&s;t of
tho&s;e I&s;lands in the main Ocean; &s;uch as the <HI>Canaries,</HI> and the <HI>Azores,</HI> and
the <HI>Ea&s;t Indian,</HI> and the <HI>Cariby</HI> I&s;lands and divers others &s;eem to have been.
A Pa&s;&s;age, to make this A&s;&s;ertion &s;omewhat more probable, I have met with
in <HI>Lin&s;choten</HI>'s De&s;cription of the I&s;land of <HI>Tercera,</HI> which as <HI>Purchas</HI> has epi|tomized
I have here added. Pag. 1670. of the 4th Part of his Pilgrims the
&s;aith, &s;peaking of the I&s;land of <HI>Tercera</HI>) &startq;The Land is very high, and as it
&s;eemeth hollow, for that as they pa&s;s over an Hill of Stone, the Ground
&s;oundeth under them as if it were a Cellar. So that it &s;eems in divers Pla|ces
to have holes under the Earth, whereby it is much &s;ubject to Earth|quakes,
as al&s;o all the other I&s;lands are, for there it is a common thing:
and all tho&s;e I&s;lands, for the mo&s;t part, have had Mines of Brim&s;tone; for
that in many Places of <HI>Tercera</HI> and St. <HI>Michael,</HI> the Smoke and Savour of
Brim&s;tone doth &s;till i&s;&s;ue out of the Ground, and the Country round about
is all &s;inged and burnt. Al&s;o there are Places wherein there are Wells,
the Water whereof is &s;o hot that it will boil an Egg, as if it were over a
Fire. Be&s;ides which, the &s;hape of the Hills, and &s;everal other Circum&s;tan|ces
mention'd in <HI>Lin&s;choten,</HI> do make it probable that tho&s;e have been all
<HI>Vulcano's.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>But to proceed to the Fourth Species of Effects of Earthquakes under this
Head; and that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fourth Species under the fir&s;t <HI>Genus</HI> of Effects.</NOTE> the rai&s;ing of the Parts of the Earth by the throwing on
a great acce&s;s of new Earth: Of this I have already given many In&s;tances in
the newly mentioned Hi&s;tories of Eruptions, where I mentioned the over|whelming
of Fields, Towns, and Woods, and the like, by Materials thrown
out by the&s;e Eruptions. I &s;hall only add one In&s;tance or two more to confirm
<PB N="304" REF="281">
this Head, and then proceed. The fir&s;t is that mentioned by <HI>Olaus Wormius,</HI>
in the 5th Chapter of the 1&s;t Section of the 1&s;t Book of his <HI>Mu&s;aeum,</HI> wherein
he gives an Account of an extraordinary Earthquake in <HI>Iceland,</HI> which fill'd
the Air with Du&s;t, Earth, and Cinders, and overwhelmed Towns, Fields and
even Ships a good way di&s;tant on the Sea; and which &s;ent &s;orth its Fumes
with &s;uch violence and Plenty, as covered all the Decks and Sails of Ships
lying on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Norway,</HI> &s;ome hundred Leagues di&s;tant. His Words
are Page the 18th thus, <HI>Alterum portento&s;ae Terrae genus,</HI> &amp;c. And to make
this or <HI>Wormius</HI> the more probable, I have now by me a Paper of Du&s;t, which
was rained out of the Air upon a Ship lying at <HI>Algier</HI> upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bar|bary,</HI>
upon a great Eruption of <HI>Ve&s;uvius</HI> in the Year 16&mdash;The Relation of
which, as 1 received it together with the Paper of Du&s;t from that eminent
Virtuo&s;o, <HI>John Evelyn,</HI> E&s;&abque; I &s;hall here annex.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="marg">This was o|mitted by the Author.</NOTE> But which is beyond all, is
the late Eruption of <HI>Mongibell</HI> of <HI>Aetna.</HI></P>
<P>And to confirm this Propo&s;ition yet further, I cannot pa&s;s by a very remar|kable
Rain of Earth and A&s;hes, that happen'd in <HI>Peru, Anno</HI> 1600, men|tioned
by <HI>Garcila&s;&s;o De la Vega,</HI> one of the Off-&s;pring of the <HI>Incas of Peru,</HI> in
his Hi&s;tory of <HI>America.</HI> The Epitome of which by <HI>Purchas,</HI> is this, pag. 1476
of the 4th Part of his <HI>Pilgrims.</HI> &startq;I might add, &s;ays he, the great Earth|quakes,
<HI>An.</HI> 1600, in <HI>Peru</HI> at <HI>Arequepa,</HI> the raining of Sand, as al&s;o of
A&s;hes, about 20 days from a <HI>Vulcan</HI> breaking forth: The A&s;hes falling in
Places above a Yard thick, in &s;ome Places more than two, and where lea&s;t
above a quarter of a Yard, which buried the Corn-grounds of Maize and
Wheat, and the Boughs of Trees were broken and fruitle&s;s, and the Cattel
great and &s;mall dy'd for want of Pa&s;ture. for the Sand which rained covered
the Fields 30 Leagues one way, and above 40 Leagues another way, round
about <HI>Arequepa,</HI> they found their Kine dead by 500 together in &s;everal Herds,
and whole Flocks of Sheep, and Herds of Goats and Swine buried. Hou|&s;es
fell with the weight of the Sand; others co&s;t much Indu&s;try to &s;ave them;
mighty Thunders and Lightning were heard and &s;een 30 Leagues about <HI>A|requepa.</HI>
It was &s;o dark whil&s;t tho&s;e Showers la&s;ted, that at mid-day they
burned Candles to &s;ee to do bu&s;ine&s;s.&endq;&mdash;I could add divers other In&s;tances
to confirm this Propo&s;ition; but the&s;e may at pre&s;ent &s;uffice.</P>
<P>But this is but one way by which divers things have been buried: there is
another way which I can only at pre&s;ent mention, and mu&s;t refer the Proba|tion
and Pro&s;ecution to &s;ome other occa&s;ion; and that is, that very many
of the lower &s;uperficial Parts of the Earth, have been and continually are
covered and buried by the acce&s;s of Matter, tumbled and wa&s;hed down by
Exce&s;&s;es of Wind and Rain, and by the continual &s;weepings of Rivers and
Streams of Water. Under this Head, I &s;hall &s;hew &s;everal Places and Coun|tries
in the World, that are nothing el&s;e but the Productions of the&s;e Cau&s;es.
To this purpo&s;e, <HI>Peter de la Valle</HI> gives &s;ome Ob&s;ervations which he made in
<HI>Egypt,</HI> in the 11th Letter dated from <HI>Grand Caire, Jan.</HI> 25. 1616. &startq;of the
former &s;even Mouths of <HI>Nile</HI> (&s;ays he) there are only four left, and of
tho&s;e but two Navigable; the re&s;t are either fill'd, or run no more, or are
&s;mall Streams not taken notice of, or only Torrents in the time of great
Rains; but I could learn nothing of them, becau&s;e the great Expence of
the Ancients for clean&s;ing the Ditches, has been intermitted for &s;everal
hundreds of Years.&endq; He is likewi&s;e of Opinion with <HI>Herodotus,</HI> that the
<HI>Delta,</HI> and all the Lower <HI>Egypt,</HI> where the <HI>Greeks</HI> navigated in his time, was
in the fir&s;t Ages of the World made by the Sand and Mud of <HI>Nile.</HI></P>
<P>All which Hi&s;tories and Particulars do manife&s;tly enough evince, that there
have been in very many Parts of the World con&s;iderable Mutations of the
&s;uperficial Parts, &s;ince the beginning; and that therefore tho&s;e Places where
the&s;e figured petrify'd Bodies are found; though they now &s;eem never &s;o much
foreign, and differing from the likely native Places of &s;uch animated Bodies,
may notwith&s;tanding heretofore have been in &s;uch another kind of condition,
as was mo&s;t &s;utable to the breeding and nouri&s;hing of them: Which I &s;hall
yet further manife&s;t, by comparing the other Effects produced by Earth|quakes;
&s;uch as the &s;inking, and burying, and tran&s;po&s;ing, and overturning
of the &s;uperficial Parts of the Earth.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="282">
Another Sort of Effects, is the &s;inking of the &s;uperficial Parts of the Earth,
and placing them below their former Po&s;ition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;econd &s;ort or General Head of Ef|fects of Earth|quakes.</NOTE> both in re&s;pect of &s;ome Parts
newly rai&s;ed, and in re&s;pect of &s;ome other adjacent Parts not displaced. And
this &s;eems to be caus'd by the &s;ub&s;iding or &s;inking of tho&s;e Parts into &s;uch Ca|verns,
as by the &s;trength of the Eruption pa&s;&s;ing below before it breaks out
are made underneath: For &s;o great is the Violence of the&s;e &s;ubterraneous Fires,
that nothing almo&s;t is able to re&s;i&s;t their Power of expanding; but &s;preading
them&s;elves, and ru&s;hing that way which is mo&s;t ea&s;y, they carry along be|fore
them Earth, Sand, and Rocks, and Mountains, and whatever lies in
their way, and rai&s;e the &s;uperficial Parts of the Earth whil&s;t they pa&s;s under|neath.
And if the Parts of the Earth underneath are &s;o loo&s;e or obnoxious
to the Force of the Fire, as to be di&s;lodged, unle&s;s the remaining Parts are
very &s;trong and con&s;titute a very firm Stony Arch, the Earth does ea&s;ily tum|ble
into the Holes and Hollows made by the Fire. Now it cannot be ima|gin'd
but that all tho&s;e va&s;t Congeries of Earth, which I have already mention'd
to have been thrown up, and to create new I&s;lands and new Mountains, and
the like, mu&s;t leave va&s;t Caverns below them, to be fill'd either with the
Parts of the Earth that hang immediately over them, or with the Sea, or o|ther
&s;ubterraneous Waters, if the Roofs of the&s;e Cavities be &s;trong enough to
&s;u&s;tain the Earth above them from &s;inking. And &s;ome &s;uch Power as the&s;e
&s;ubterraneous Fires, &s;eems to me to have been the Cau&s;e of the &s;trange Po&s;i|tions
and Intermixture of the Veins of Ores and Minerals in the Bowels of the
Mountains, where, for the mo&s;t part, they are now found; and even of
bringing tho&s;e Sub&s;tances &s;o near the Surface of the Earth, which, from the
Con&s;ideration of very many Circum&s;tances, &s;eem to me to be naturally &s;itua|ted
at a much greater Depth below within the Bowels of this Globe. And
hence may be rendred a Rea&s;on of the Figures of the&s;e Minerals, and other
Sub&s;tances mix'd with them, and of the compounding and blending of &s;everal
of tho&s;e Sub&s;tances together, whereby &s;ome of them are very &s;trangely uni|ted

His Relations are the&s;e, <HI>Pag. 62. &startq;Augu&s;t</HI> the 4th, 1585. after a ve|ry
violent Storm of Thunder and Rain, at <HI>Nottingham</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> Eight miles
from <HI>London,</HI> the Ground &s;uddenly began to &s;ink; and Three great Elms
growing upon it, were carried &s;o deep into the Earth, that no Part of them
could any more be &s;een. The Hole left (&s;aith the Story) is in Compa&s;s 80
Yards about, and a Line of 50 Fathoms plummed into it finds no Bottom&punc;&endq;

the third morning 80 Foot more at lea&s;t, and &s;o daily. (And pre&s;ently af|ter,
he &s;ays) Moreover, in one Part of the Plain Field, there is a great Hole
made by &s;inking of the Earth, to the Depth of 30 Foot at lea&s;t, being in
Breadth in &s;ome Places 2 Perches over, and in Length 5 or 6 Perches&punc;
There are &s;undry other Sinkings in divers other Places, one of 60 Foot, a|nother
of 47, and another of 34 Foot; by means of which Confu&s;ion it is
come to pa&s;s, that where the highe&s;t Hills were, there be the lowe&s;t Dales,
and the lowe&s;t Dales are become the highe&s;t Grounds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>And again, <HI>Pag.</HI> 131. he gives an In&s;tance, upon his own Knowledge, much
to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, which lately happen'd; namely, &startq;<HI>July</HI> the 8th 1657.
<PB N="306" REF="283">
about 3 of the Clock, in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Bickly,</HI> was heard a very great Noi&s;e
like Thunder afar off; which was much wonder'd at, becau&s;e the Sky was
clear, and no Appearance of a Cloud. Shortly after (&s;aith the Author of
this Relation) a Neighbour came to me, and told me, I &s;hould &s;ee a very
&s;trange thing if I would go with him. So coming into a Field, called the
<HI>Lay-field,</HI> we found a very great Bank of Earth, which had many tall Oaks
growing on it, quite &s;unk into the Ground Trees and all. At first we dur&s;t
not go near it, becau&s;e the Earth, for near 20 Yards about, was exceeding|ly
much rent, and &s;eem'd ready to fall: But &s;ince that time, my &s;elf and
&s;ome others have ventured to &s;ee the bottom, I mean to go to the Brink, &s;o
as to di&s;cern the vi&s;ible Bottom, which is Water, and conceived to be about
30 Yards from us; under which is &s;unk all the Earth about it, for 16 Yards
round at lea&s;t, 3 tall Oaks, a very tall Awber, and certain other &s;mall
Trees, and not a Sprig of them to be &s;een above Water. 4 or 5 Oaks
more are expected to fall every moment, and a great Quantity of Land is
like to fall, indeed never cea&s;ing more or le&s;s; and when any considerable
Clod falls, it is much like the Report of a Cannon. We can di&s;cern the
Ground hollow above the Water a great Depth; but how far hollow or how
deep, is not to be found out by Man. Some of the Water, (as I have been
told) drawn out of this Pit with a Bucket, was found to be as falt as Sea|water,
<HI>&amp;c.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>A con&s;iderable Circum&s;tance al&s;o to confirm this Propo&s;ition, is a Pa&s;&s;age
in that Hi&s;tory I have mention'd out of <HI>Lin&s;choten,</HI> of the I&s;land of <HI>Tercera;</HI>

<P><HI>Kircher</HI> in the Preface to his <HI>Mundus Subterraneus,</HI> Chap. 2. tells us a very
remarkable Hi&s;tory of the &s;inking of a Town, and the Land about it, and the
Generation of a Lake in&s;tead of it. <HI>Contigit</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>hac eadem hora res aeter|na

&startq;At this very time happened a thing worthy never to be forgotten, <HI>viz.</HI> the
Subver&s;ion of the mo&s;t famous Town, call'd St. <HI>Euphemia:</HI> 'twas &s;ituated at
the &s;ide of the Bay under the Juri&s;diction of the Knights of <HI>Malta.</HI> When
therefore we had come to <HI>Lopiz,</HI> almo&s;t dead from the vehement &s;hak|ing
of the Earth, and lying pro&s;trate on the Ground, at la&s;t the <HI>Paroxy&s;m</HI>
of Nature remitting, ca&s;ting our Eyes towards the Neighbouring Places,
we &s;aw the forementioned Town encompa&s;&s;ed with a great, wonderful, and
unu&s;ual Cloud, which was &s;een by us three times, e&s;pecially at Three-a-clock
in the Afternoon, the Heavens being clear. This Cloud being, by degrees,
di&s;&s;ipated, we look'd for the Town, but found it not, a &s;tinking Lake (to
our wonder) appearing in the Place of it. We &s;ought for &s;ome Per&s;on or
other, to give us &s;ome certain Account of this unu&s;ual Event; but could
not find one to tell any News of this dreadful Accident and great De&s;tru|ction,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> We pro&s;ecuting our Journey, pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Nica&s;trum, Amantea,
Paula,</HI> and <HI>Belvedere,</HI> found nothing for 200 Miles, but the remaining Car|ca&s;&s;es
of Cities and Ca&s;tles, and horrid De&s;tructions, the Men lying in
the open Fields, and, as it were, dead and withered through Fear and
Terror.&endq;</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e, give me leave to adjoin an Extract of a Letter, &s;ent from
<HI>Bala&s;ore</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies, Jan.</HI> 6. 1665. &startq;The &s;ame Star appeared in our
Horizon, about the &s;ame time 'twas &s;een with you. The Effects in part
<PB N="307" REF="284">
have already been felt here by un&s;ea&s;onable Weather, great Mortalities a|mong&s;t
the Natives, <HI>English,</HI> and others. We have had &s;everal Earth|quakes
unu&s;ual here, which, with hideous Noi&s;es, have in &s;everal Places
broke out and &s;wallow'd up Hou&s;es and Towns. But about 7 Days Journey
from <HI>Ducca,</HI> where were at that time 3 or 4 <HI>Dutch,</HI> they and the Natives
relate, That in the Market-Place the Earth trembled about 32 Days and
Nights, without Intermi&s;&s;ion. At the latter end, in the Market-place, the
Ground turn'd round as Du&s;t in a Whirlwind, and &s;o continued &s;everal
Days and Nights, and &s;wallow'd up &s;everal Men who were Spectators, who
&s;unk and turned round with the Earth, as in a Quagmire. At la&s;t, the
Earth worked and ca&s;t up a great Fi&s;h bigger than hath been &s;een in this
Country, which the People caught: But the Conclu&s;ion of all was, that the
Earth &s;unk with 300 Hou&s;es, and all the Men, where now appears a large
Lake &s;ome Fathoms deep. About a Mile from this Town was a Lake full
of Fi&s;h, which in the&s;e 32 Days of the Earthquake ca&s;t up all her Fi&s;h on
dry Land, where might have been gather'd many, which had run out of the
Water upon dry Land, and there died: But when the other great Lake ap|peared,
this former dried up, and is now firm Land.&endq;</P>
<P>To the &s;ame purpo&s;e al&s;o we have &s;everal other In&s;tances, &s;ome later and
&s;ome nearer home. &startq;Near <HI>Darlington,</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Childrey,</HI> in his <HI>Britannia Baconi|ca,</HI>
&s;peaking of the Rarities of the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham)</HI> are three Pits,
who&s;e Waters are warm (hot, &s;ays <HI>Cambden)</HI> wonderful deep, call'd Hell-Kettles.
The&s;e are thought to come of an Earthquake, that happen'd
<HI>Anno</HI> 1179. For on <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> Day, &s;ays our Chronicles, at <HI>Oxenhall,</HI> which
is this Place, the Ground heaved up aloft like a Tower, and &s;o continued
all that Day, as it were immovable, till Evening, and then fell in with a
very horrible Noi&s;e, and the Earth &s;wallow'd it up, and made in the &s;ame
Place 3 deep Pits. The &s;ame in the Section of <HI>Brecknock,</HI> &s;ays, 'Two Miles
Ea&s;t from <HI>Brecknock,</HI> is a Meer, called <HI>Llin&s;avathan,</HI> which (as the People
dwelling there, &s;ay,) was once a City; but the City was &s;wallowed up by
an Earthquake, and this Water or Lake &s;ucceeded in the Place: The Lake
is encompa&s;&s;ed with high &s;teep Hills, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;-&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Near <HI>Falkirk,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Lithgow,</HI> remains the Ruines and Marks of a Town,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;wallowed up into the Earth by an Earthquake, and the void Place is
fill'd with Water.&endq;&mdash;-<HI>Pliny</HI> al&s;o, in the 88th Chap. of his 2d Book of Nat.
Hi&s;t. records a like In&s;tance. <HI>Mox &amp; in his Montem Epopon cum repente flam|ma

Flame had &s;hon out of it) was levelled with the Plain; and in the &s;ame
Plain a Town was &s;wallow'd up into the Deep, and by another Motion of
the Earth became a Lake. And in another Place, the Mountain being
tumbled down, the I&s;land <HI>Prochyta</HI> aro&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>The Dead Sea al&s;o in <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> was the Production of a mo&s;t terrible Earth|quake,
and a Fire &s;ent from Heaven: for, methinks, the Relation of the &s;ad
Cata&s;trophe of tho&s;e Four Cities, <HI>Sodom, Gomorrha, Zeboim</HI> and <HI>Adma,</HI> mention|ed
in Scripture, &s;eem &s;omewhat like that I have newly related out of <HI>Kircher</HI> of
St. <HI>Euphemia.</HI> There are a multitude of other In&s;tances which I could bring
on this Head, of the &s;inking of Mountains and Hills into Plains, and all the&s;e
into Lakes: Of which <HI>Pliny</HI> gives &s;everal In&s;tances, in the 90, 91, and 92 Chap.
of his Second Book. The <HI>Pico</HI> in the <HI>Moluccas,</HI> accounted of equal Height
with that of <HI>Tenariff,</HI> was by a late Earthquake quite &s;wallow'd into the
Earth, and Ieft a $ake in its Place. <HI>Ve&s;uvius</HI> and <HI>Strongylus,</HI> are by late
Earthquakes reduced to almo&s;t half their former Height. Many of tho&s;e va&s;t
Mountains of the <HI>Andes</HI> in <HI>Chile,</HI> were by an Earthquake, <HI>An.</HI> 164 6. quite
&s;wallow'd up and lo&s;t, as <HI>Kircher</HI> relates. I could add many Hi&s;tories of the
fatal Cata&s;trophe's of many Towns, and other Places of Note; but the&s;e, I
hope, may &s;uffice to &s;hew this kind al&s;o of Mutation in the &s;uperficial Parts of
the Earth, to be effected by Earthquakes.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="285">
Nor does Earthquakes only &s;ink Mountains and Inland Parts; but &s;uch
Parts al&s;o as are near to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;econd Spe|cies of tho&s;e Effects under the &s;econd Ge|$eral.</NOTE> equal with, and under the Surface of the Sea. Of
this we have In&s;tances near home, of <HI>Winchel&s;ea</HI> and of the <HI>Goodwin-Lands,</HI>
and of the Towns in <HI>Freezland,</HI> that have been about 400 Years &s;ince &s;wal|low'd
up by the Sea; and nothing but &s;ome Towers, and the <HI>Goodwin-Sands,</HI>
are now to be found of them. The like happen'd to &s;everal Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
as <HI>Hector Boethius</HI> relates. <HI>Lin&s;choten,</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> re|lates
among many other Hi&s;tories of the Effects of Earthquakes, this con&s;ide|rable
Pa&s;&s;age. &startq;Since, in the Year 1586. in the Month of <HI>July,</HI> fell another
Earthquake in the City of <HI>Kings,</HI> the which, as the Vice-Roy did write,
had run 170 Leagues along the Coa&s;t, and athwart in the <HI>Sierra</HI> 50 Leagues.
It ruin'd a great Part of the City. It caus'd the like Trouble and Motion
of the Sea, as it had done at <HI>Chile,</HI> which happen'd pre&s;ently after the
Earthquake; &s;o as they might &s;ee the Sea to fly furiou&s;ly out of her Bounds,
and to run near 2 Leagues into the Land, ri&s;ing above 14 Fathom. It co|ver'd
all the Plain, so as the Ditches were filled and Pieces of Wood that were
here, &s;wam in the Water.&endq; There are multitudes of In&s;tances of the like Effects
in &s;everal other Parts of the World, which have been wrought by Earth|quakes,
which may be found in Natural Hi&s;torians; which, for Brevity-&s;ake,
I omit, they &s;erving only to prove a Propo&s;ition, which, i &s;uppo&s;e, will be
granted by any that have either &s;een or heard of the Effects of Earthquakes.</P>
<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The third Spe|cies of Effects under the &s;e|cond General.</NOTE> though I find $ general Deficiency in Natural Hi&s;torians, of In&s;tan|ces
to prove that the &s;ubmarine Parts have likewi&s;e &s;uffer'd the like Effects of
&s;inking, they lying out of View, and &s;o cannot without &s;ome Trouble and
Diligence be ob&s;erved; yet if we con&s;ider from how great a Depth the&s;e E|ruptions
proceed, and how little Di&s;tinction they make between Mountains
and Plains, as to the weight of removing, we may ea&s;ily believe, that the
Bottom of the Sea is as &s;ubject to the&s;e Mutations, as the Parts of the Land.
And &s;ince, by the former Relations, we have many In&s;tances of the rai&s;ing
of the Bottom of the Sea, 'tis very probable that what Quantity of Matter
is thrown to and rai&s;ed in one Place, is &s;unk and falls into that Cavity left
by another. An I&s;land cannot be rai&s;ed in one Place, without leaving an
Aby&s;s in another. And I do not doubt, but there have been as many Earth|quakes
in the Parts of the Earth under the Ocean, as there have been
in the Parts of the Dry Land: But being, for the mo&s;t part, till of late un|frequented
by Mankind, and even now but very thinly, 'tis almo&s;t a 1000 to
$, that what happen are never &s;een; and a 100 to 1, if they have been &s;een,
whether they be recorded: For how few Writers are there of Natural
Hi&s;tory? There is &s;omewhat of Probability in the Story related by <HI>Plato,</HI>
in his <HI>Timaeus,</HI> of the I&s;land <HI>Atlantis</HI> in the <HI>Atlantick,</HI> Ocean, which he
&s;ays was &s;wallow'd up by an Earthquake into the Sea. And 'tis not unlike|ly,
but that mo&s;t of tho&s;e I&s;lands that are now appearing, have been either
thrown up out of the Sea by Eruptions, &s;uch as the <HI>Canaries, Azores,</HI> St. <HI>He|lena,
&amp;c.</HI> which the Form of them, and the Vulcanes in them, and the Cin|ders
and Pumice-&s;tones found about them, and the frequent Earthquakes they
are troubled with, and the remaining Hills of extingui&s;h'd Vulcanes, do all &s;trong|ly
argue for: Or el&s;e, that they are &s;ome of them at lea&s;t &s;ome Relicts of that Great
I&s;land which is now not to be found; and yet we have no Records hereof. That
there is as great Inequality in the Depth of the Sea, as there is in the Height
of the Land, the Ob&s;ervations of Seamen, experimented by their Sounding
Lines, do &s;ufficiently inform us: For Hills, we have deep Holes; and for
Mountains and Pikes, Aby&s;&s;es and Mal&s;troons: And that the&s;e mu&s;t have in
all Ages been filling with Parts of the Earth, tumbled by the Motion of the
Waters, and rowling to the lowe&s;t Place, is very probable; and so they
would in time have been fill'd up, had not Earthquakes, by their Eruptions
and Tumblings, created new Irregularities. And therefore that there are
&s;till &s;uch Places, is an Argument, that there have been of later Ages Earth|quakes
in &s;ome of them. Of the&s;e I &s;hall mention one or two In&s;tances, which
I meet with in Voyages, and Relations of Travellers.</P>

High-ways near a hundred Yards from their old Paths. The Ground that
they remov'd was about twenty <HI>&s;ix</HI> Acres, which opening it&s;elf with Rocks
and all bore the Earth before it for four hundred Yards &s;pace, without any
&s;tay, leaving Pa&s;turage in places of the Tillage, and the Tillage over&s;pread
with Pa&s;turage. La&s;tly, overwhelming its lower parts, it mounted to a

I Engli&s;h. thus. &startq;All things are &s;ubject to the &s;ame chance; tho' they are
not yet moved, they are movable; for we err, if we believe any part of
the Earth excu&s;ed and free from this hazzard; all are &s;ubject to the &s;ame
Law; nothing is made by Nature &s;o fixt as to be unmoveable; &s;ome &s;ink at
one time, &s;ome at another: And as in great Cities, now this Hou&s;e, now
that Hou&s;e hangs tottering on Props; &s;o on the great Face of the Earth,
now this part fails, now that: <HI>Tyre</HI> formerly was remarkable for its De|&s;truction:
<HI>A&s;ia</HI> lo&s;t at once Twelve Cities. Whatever the Power may be,
the former Year <HI>Achaia</HI> and <HI>Macedonia</HI> felt It now <HI>Campania:</HI> Fate goes
round, and repeates what it had long before acted: It brings &s;ome things
often on the Stage, &s;ome &s;eldom; but &s;uffers nothing ab&s;olutely free and
untouch'd. Not we Men only are brought forth &s;hort Liv'd, frail Beings:
Cities, Countries, Shores, nay the Sea it&s;elf are the Slaves of Fate. Why
therefore do we flatter our &s;elves that the gifts of Fortune will &s;tick by us,
or that Happine&s;s will ob&s;erve any Rule or Mea&s;ure, Happine&s;s the mo&s;t
fleeting of all humane Things? They that promi&s;e to them&s;elves all things
fixt, &s;urely never think that the very Ground we &s;tand on is it &s;elf unfixt.
Nor was that the frailty only of <HI>Campania</HI> or <HI>Achia,</HI> 'tis the &s;ame in all
Soils and Countries, to be loo&s;ely join'd and compacted, but ea&s;ily and by
many ways di&s;&s;olved; the whole remains while each part changes and &s;inks
into Ruine and Alteration.&endq;</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee all Countries in the World are &s;ubject to the&s;e Convul&s;ions,
out tho&s;e mo&s;t of all that are mo&s;t Mountainous: Such are u&s;ually all the Sea
Coa&s;ts, therefore <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;ays, That the <HI>Alps,</HI> and <HI>Appnnine</HI> Mountains have
very often been troubled with Earthquakes. <HI>Maritima autem maxime quati|untur</HI>

e&s;cape, for I have often found the <HI>Alpes</HI> and <HI>Apennines</HI> tremble.</P>
<P>For mo&s;t probably tho&s;e that are mo&s;t Mountainous, are mo&s;t Cavernous un|derneath
them; to countenance which Opinion, I remember to have taken
notice in certain very high Cliffs towards the Sea &s;ide, where the Hills &s;eem|ed,
as it were, cleft a&s;under, the one half having been probably foundred and
tumbled down into the Sea, and the other half, as it were remaining, that at
the bottom, near the Water, for almo&s;t the whole length, there were very
many large Caverns, which, by &s;everal Circum&s;tances, &s;eem'd to be made be|fore
the acce&s;s of the Sea thereunto, and not by the wa&s;hing and beating of
the Waves again&s;t the bottom of the&s;e Cliffs; for I ob&s;erv'd in many of them,
that the Plates or Layers, as I may &s;o call tho&s;e parts between the Clefts in
<PB N="312" REF="289">
Rocks, and Cliffs to lean contrary ways, and to meet, as it were, at the top
like the Roof of a Hou&s;e, and others of them in other forms, as if they had
been Caverns left between many va&s;t Rocks tumbled confu&s;edly one upon another.
And indeed I cannot imagine, hut that under the&s;e Mountains, I&s;lands,
Cliffs or Lands, that have been much rais'd above their former level, there
mu&s;t be left va&s;t Caverns, whence all that Matter was thrown, where pro|bably
may be the Seat or Place of the Generation of tho&s;e prodigious Pow|ers.
But this only by the Bye; for I intend not here to examine the cau&s;es
of their beginnings, force, and powerful Effects, nor of their remaining, cea&s;|ing,
renewing, or the like. It being &s;ufficient, for my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, to
&s;hew, That they have been certainly ob&s;erv'd to produce tho&s;e extraordinary
Effects from what Cau&s;e &s;oever they proceed. That they have been hereto|fore
in many places where they have now ceas'd for many Ages; and that
they have lately happen'd in places, where we have no Hi&s;tory that does a&s;|&s;ure
us they have been heretofore. That they have turn'd Plains into Moun|tains,
and Mountains into Plains; Seas into Land, and Land into Seas; made
Rivers where there were none before, and &s;wallowed up others that formerly
were; made and de&s;troy'd Lakes, made Penin&s;uls I&s;lands, and I&s;lands Penin|&s;ulas;
vomited up I&s;lands in &s;ome places, and &s;wallowed them down in others;
overturn'd, tumbl'd and thrown from place to place Cities, Woods, Hills,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> cover'd, burnt, wa&s;ted and chang'd the &s;uperficial Parts in others; and
many the like &s;trange Effects, which, &s;ince the Creation of the World, have
wrought many very great changes on the &s;uperficial Parts of the Earth, and
have been the great In&s;truments or Cau&s;es of placing Shells, Bones, Plants,
Fi&s;hes, and the like, in tho&s;e places, where, with much a&s;toni&s;hment, we
find them.</P>
<P>Concerning the Vici&s;&s;itudes that places are &s;ubject to, in relation to Earth|quakes,
I find a memorable Pa&s;&s;age &s;ent by <HI>Paul Ricaut</HI> E&s;guire, now Con&s;ule
of <HI>Smyrna,</HI> Dated <HI>Novomber</HI> 23. 1667. <HI>&startq;Con&s;tantinople,</HI> &s;ays he, is not now &s;o
&s;ubject to Earthquakes as reported in former times, there having not hap|pen'd
in the la&s;t &s;even Years, in which I have been an Inhabitant there, above
one of which I have been &s;en&s;ible; but within the&s;e twenty Days in <HI>Smyrna</HI>
fell out an Earthquake which dangerou$ly &s;hook all the Buildings, but did
little or no harm; the Ships in the Road, and others at an Anchor, about
three Leagues from hence, were &s;en&s;ible of it. It is reported that this
City hath been already &s;even times devoured by Earthquakes, and it is pro|phe&s;ied,
that it &s;hall be &s;o again &s;o &s;oon as the Hou&s;es reach the old Ca&s;tle
upon the top of the Hill, on the &s;ide of which remains the Ruins of the old
City and the Tomb of St. <HI>Polycarpus,</HI> St. <HI>John</HI>'s Di&s;ciple, &s;till pre&s;erv'd by
the <HI>Greek$</HI> in great Veneration.&endq;</P>
<P>Another Cau&s;e there is which has been al&s;o a very great In&s;trument in the
promoting the alte$ations on the Surface of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Motion of the Water an|other cau&s;e of alterations on the Earth.</NOTE> and that is the motion
of the Water; whether caus'd <HI>1&s;t.</HI> By its De&s;cent from &s;ome higher place, &s;uch
as Rivers and Streams, caus'd by the immediate falls of Rain, or Snow, or by
the melting of Snow from the &s;ides of Hills. Or, <HI>2dly.</HI> By the natural Mo|tions
of the Sea, &s;uch as are the Tides and Currents. Or, <HI>3dly.</HI> By the ac|cidental
motions of it caus'd by Winds and Storms. Of each of the&s;e we
have very many In&s;tances in Natural Hi&s;torians, and were they &s;ilent, the
con&s;tant Effects, would daily &s;peak as much. The former Principle &s;eems
to be that which generates Hills, and Holes, Cliffs, and Caverns, and all
manner of A&s;perity and irregularity in the Surface of the Earth; and this
is that which indeavours to reduce them back again to their pri&s;tine Re|gularity,
by wa&s;hing down the tops of Hills, and filling up the bottoms of
Pits, which is indeed con&s;onant to all the other methods of Nature, in work|ing
with contrary Principles of Heat and Cold, Drine&s;s, and Moi&s;ture,
Light and Darkne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c</HI> by which there is, as it were, a continual circu|lation.
Water is rais'd in Vapours into the Air by one Quality and precipa|ted
down in drops by an other, the Rivers run into the Sea, and the Sea, a|gain
&s;upplies them. In the circular Motion of all the Planets, there is a di|rect
Motion which makes them indeavour to recede from the Sun or Center,
<PB N="313" REF="290">
and a magnetick or attractive Power that keeps them from receding. Ge|neration
creates and Death de&s;troys; Winter reduces what Summer pro|duces:
The Night refre&s;hes what the Day has &s;corcht, and the Day cheri&s;hes
what the Night benumb'd. The Air impregnates the Ground in one place,
and is impregnated by it in another. All things almo&s;t circulate and have
their Vici&s;&s;itudes. We have multitudes of in&s;tances of the wa&s;ting of the
tops of Hills, and of the filling or increa&s;ing of the Plains or lower Grounds,
of Rivers continually carrying along with them great quantities of Sand,
Mud, or other Sub&s;tances from higher to lower places. Of the Seas wa&s;h|ing
Cliffs away and wa&s;ting the Shores: Of Land Floods carrying away with
them all things that &s;tand in their way, and covering tho&s;e Lands with Mud
which they overflow, levelling Ridges and filling Ditches. Tides and Cur|rents
in the Sea act in all probability what Floods and Rivers do at Land;
and Storms effect that on the Sea Coa&s;ts, that great Land Floods do on the
Banks of Rivers. <HI>Aegypt</HI> as lying very low and yearly overflow'd, is inlarg'd by
the &s;ediment of the <HI>Nile;</HI> e&s;pecially towards that part where the <HI>Nile</HI> falls in|to
the <HI>Mediterranean.</HI> The Gulph of <HI>Venice</HI> is almo&s;t choak'd with the Sand of
the <HI>Po.</HI> The Mouth of the <HI>Thames</HI> is grown very &s;hallow by the continual
&s;upply of Sand brought down with the Stream. Mo&s;t part of the Cliffs that
Wall in this I&s;land do Yearly founder and tumble into the Sea. By the&s;e
means many parts are covered and rais'd by Mud and Sand that lye almo&s;t:
level with the Water, and others are di&s;cover'd and laid open that for many Ages have been hid.</P>
<P>Of this kind the Royal Society received a memorable Account from
the Learned Dr. <HI>Brown</HI> concerning a petrified Bone of a prodigious bigne&s;s,
di&s;cover'd by the falling of &s;ome Cliffs; the words of the Relation are the&s;e.
&startq;This Bone (which he pre&s;ented the Royal Society, and is now in the Re|po&s;itory)
was found la&s;t Year 1666. on the Sea Shore, not far from <HI>Win|terton</HI>
in <HI>Norfolk;</HI> it was found near the Clift after two great Floods, &s;ome
thou&s;and Loads of Earth being broken down by the rage of the Sea, as it
often happens upon this Coa&s;t, where the Cliffs con&s;i&s;t not of Rock but of
Earth. That it came not out of the Sea may be conjectur'd becau&s;e it was
found near the Cliff, and by the colour of it, for if out of the Sea it would
have been whiter. Upon the &s;ame Coa&s;t, but as I take it, nearer <HI>Hasbo|rough,</HI>
divers great Bones are &s;aid to have been found, and I have &s;een a lower
Jaw containing Teeth of a prodigious bigne&s;s and &s;omewhat petrified. All
that have been found on this Coa&s;t have been found after the falling of &s;ome
Cliff, where the outward Cru&s;t is fallen off, it clearly re&s;embles the Bones
of Whales and great Cetaceous Animals, comparing it with the Scull and
Bones of a Whale which was ca&s;t upon the Coa&s;t near <HI>Wells,</HI> and which I
have by me, the weight whereof is 55 Pounds.&endq; Thus far he on this Sub|ject.
&startq;To this may be added the <HI>Chartham</HI> News, or the di&s;covery of River|hor&s;e,
or the <HI>Hippopotamus</HI> Teeth printed in the <HI>Philo&s;. Tran&s;actions.</HI> N. 272.

<P>Nor are the&s;e Changes now only, but they have in all probability been of
as long &s;tanding as the World. So 'tis probable there may have been &s;eve|ral
vici&s;&s;itudes of changes wrought upon the &s;ame part of the Earth; it may
have been of an exact &s;pherical Form, with the re&s;t of the Earths or Planets,
at the Creation of the World, before the eternal Command of the Almighty,
that the Waters under the Heaven &s;hould go to their place; which before co|ver'd
the Earth, &s;o as that it was <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, invi&s;ible and incompleated,
and the Darkne&s;s of the Deep was over it (being all over cover'd with a very
thick &s;hell of Water which environ'd it on every &s;ide, it being then in all pro|bability
created of an exact Spherical Figure, and &s;o the Waters being of
them&s;elves lighter than the Earth, mu&s;t equally &s;pread them&s;elves over the
whole Surface of the Earth) and where the Breath of the Lord moved above or
upon the Surface of the&s;e Waters. It may, I &s;ay, in probability have been then
a part of the exact Sphoerical Surface of the Earth, and upon the command
that the Waters under the Air or Atmo&s;phere (which &s;eems to be denoted
by <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or Firmament; for the Hebrew Word &s;ignifies an Expan&s;um)
<PB N="314" REF="291">
&s;hould be gathered together into one place, and that the dry Land &s;hould ap|pear.
It may have been by that extraordinary Earthquake (whereby the
Hills and Land were rais'd in one place, and the Pits or deeper places, whe|ther
the Water was to recede and be gathered together to con&s;titute the
Sea were &s;unk in another rais'd perhaps to lye on the top of a Hill or in
a Plain, or &s;unk into the bottom of the Sea, and by the wa&s;hing of Waters
in motion, either carried to a lower place to cover &s;ome part of the Vale,
or el&s;e be cover'd by adventitious Earth, brought down upon it from &s;ome
higher place; which kind of alterations were certainly very great by the
Flood of <HI>Noah,</HI> and &s;everal other Floods we find recorded in Heathen Wri|ters.
If at lea&s;t there were not &s;omewhat of an Earthquake which might a|gain
&s;ink tho&s;e Parts which had been formerly rai&s;ed to make the dry Land
appear, and rai&s;e the bottom of the Sea, which had been &s;unk for the gather|ing

<P>There are yet two other Cau&s;es of the mutation of the &s;uperficial Parts of
the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two other Cau|&s;es of the chan|ges on the &s;u|perficial parts of the Earth: fir&s;t from over|flowing of the Streams and Inundations of the Sea.</NOTE> which have wrought many great changes in the World, and tho&s;e
are either the Sea's overflowing of a Country or Place, when forced on it
with &s;ome violent Storms or Hurr$cans of Wind, or from the over-flowing
of Rivers from great falls of Rain, or from &s;omething &s;topping their Cour&s;e, of
the&s;e we have many In&s;tances in Voyages, and we have very often times here
at <HI>London</HI> felt the effects of the Wind driving in the Tide with &s;uch great
force, as that it has oft times overflow'd the Banks, fill'd the Streets and
Cellers to the no &s;mall damage of the Inhabitants. &startq;At <HI>Chatmo&s;s</HI> in <HI>Lank$|&s;hire</HI>
(&s;aith <HI>Childery</HI>) is a low mo&s;&s;y Ground very large, a great part of which
(&s;aith <HI>Cambden</HI>) not long ago, the Brooks &s;welling high carry'd quite away
with them, whereby the Rivers were corrupted, and a number of fre&s;h Fi&s;h
peri&s;$ed. In which place now lies a low Vale watered with a little Brook,
where Trees have been digg'd up lying along, which are &s;uppos'd by &s;ome
to have come thus. The Channel of the Brooks being not &s;cower'd, the
Brooks hare ri&s;en, and made all the Land moori&s;h that lay lower than o|thers,
whereby the Roots of the Trees being loo&s;ned by rea&s;on of the bog|gine&s;s
of the Ground, or by the Water finding a pa&s;&s;age under Ground,
the Trees have either by their own weight, or by &s;ome Storm, been blown
down, and &s;o &s;unk into that &s;oft Earth and been &s;wallowed up: For 'tis ob|&s;ervable,
that Trees are no where digg'd out of the Earth but where the
Earth is boggy; and even upon Hills &s;uch moori&s;h and moi&s;t Grounds are
commonly found, the Wood of the&s;e Trees burning very bright like Touch|wood
(which perhaps is by rea&s;on of the bituminous Earth in which they
have been &s;o long) &s;o as &s;ome think them to be Fir-Trees. Such mighty
Trees are often found in <HI>Holland,</HI> which are thought to be undermin'd by the
Waves working into the Shore, or by Winds driven forwards and brought
to tho&s;e lower places where they &s;ettled and &s;unk. <HI>Brit. Bac.</HI> Page 167,

violent and la&s;ting Storms of Wind and Weather, &s;o that the Sandy Shore
on the Coa&s;ts of the <HI>Pembrock&s;hire,</HI> was laid bare to the very hard Ground,
which had lain hid for many Ages, and by further &s;earch the People found
great Trunks of Trees, which when they had digged up, they were ap|parently
Lopped, &s;o that one might &s;ee the &s;trokes of the Ax upon them,
as if they had been given but the Day before; the Earth look'd very black,
and the Wood of the&s;e Trunks was altogether like Ebony. At the fir&s;t
di&s;covery made by the&s;e Storms, the Trees we &s;peak of lay &s;o thick, that
the whole Shore &s;eem'd nothing but a lopped Grove. Whence may be ga|ther'd,
&s;aith <HI>Childry,</HI> that the Sea hath overflow'd much Land on this
Coa&s;t, as it has indeed many Countries bordering upon the Sea, which is
to be imputed to the ignorance of the <HI>Britans</HI> and other barbarous Nations,

<P>The <HI>Lignum Fo&s;&s;ile</HI> which is found in <HI>Italy,</HI> of which we have a good ac|count<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Account of <HI>Lignum Fo&s;|&s;ile</HI> and other Subternaneous M$tters.</NOTE>

out of the &s;ubterraneous Parts of the place where it has been found;
yet) from many remarkable circum&s;tances in this Hi&s;tory, it &s;eems very probable
to me to have been fir&s;t buried by &s;ome Earthquakes, and afterwards to be
variou&s;ly metamorpho&s;ed and changed by the Symptoms which u&s;ually follow
Earthquakes, and which this place is much vexed with, as is indeed almo&s;t all
the Country of <HI>Italy,</HI> to wit, the emitting of hot Steams and Smoaks proceeding
from &s;ubterraneons Fires, which do their often &s;hift their places, burn the
parts of &s;ome of tho&s;e Trunks into black and brittle Coles; melt a kind of
Ore into the Pores of others; petrify the Sub&s;tance of another &s;ort; bake
the Dirt and Clayi&s;h Sub&s;tances which have &s;oaked into the Pores of a
fourth &s;ort into a kind of Brick; rot the Parts of others, and convert them
into a kind of Dirt or Muddy Earth; and &s;o act variou&s;ly and produce dif|fering
Effects upon tho&s;e buried Sub&s;tances, according to the Nature of the
Earths, Minerals, Waters, Salts, Heats, Smoaks, Steams, and other active
In&s;truments ca&s;ually applied to the parts of the buried Trunks, by the con|fu&s;ion
of the Earthquakes, and by immediate application, and long continu|ance
and dige&s;tion, as I may call it, in this Laboratory of Nature, transformed
into other Sub&s;tances, and exhibit all tho&s;e admirable Phaenomena mentioned
by that Author, whereby the bury'd Bodies are transformed. Nor is it &s;o
much to be wondered at, that &s;uch Sub&s;tances as Vegetables (which being
expo&s;ed to the Vici&s;&s;itudes of the Air and Water, are quickly corrupted
and con&s;umed, and many of them much &s;ooner if buried in the Earth) &s;hould af|ter
&s;o many Ages perhaps, remain intire, and rather more &s;ub&s;tantial &s;ound
and permanent than if they were newly cut down.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whence the de|cay of Bodies.</NOTE> Since if we con&s;ider the
Nature of the decaying and corruption in all kind of Animal and Vegetable
<PB N="316" REF="293">
Sub&s;tances, we &s;hall find that the chief cau&s;e of it &s;eems to be from the Acti|on
of the fluid Parts upon the &s;olid for the di&s;&s;olving of them: and where&s;o|ever
the Internal Fluid is either fir&s;t changed or altered by the mixture of
&s;ome other heterogenous Sub&s;tance, &s;o as to loo&s;e that di&s;&s;olving property as
by the intermixture of Salt, Spirit of Wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or by incorporating with it
and hardning it into a &s;olid Sub&s;tance, as in Petrifactions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Or, &s;econdly,
exhaled by a gradual and gentle degree of heat, and &s;o the &s;olid Parts only
left alone, and kept either dry, or fill'd with a fluid of an heterogeneous
Nature, &s;uch as unctuous and &s;picy Juices with watery Sub&s;tances. Or, Third|ly,
Congealed and hardened either by cold or the peculiar Nature of the Juice
it&s;elf; &s;uch is freezing and the hardning of Coralline Plants, or Submarine
Vegetables, Horns, Gums, Bones, Hair, Feathers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where&s;oever, I
&s;ay, Bodies are by the&s;e means put into &s;uch a Con&s;titution, that the Parts
act not upon one another, and continue in that &s;tate by being pre&s;erved by
adventitious Moi&s;ture or &s;oft'ning by homogeneous Fluids, they are, as it were,
perpetual, unle&s;s by extraordinary Heat, many of the&s;e otherwi&s;e &s;olid and
unactive Sub&s;tances are made fluid by &s;uch active Di&s;olvents; and unle&s;s
they be immer&s;ed in &s;uch Liquors or Men&s;truums as do of them&s;elves di&s;&s;olve
and work on them; we &s;hall not, I &s;ay, wonder at the la&s;tingne&s;s of the&s;e
buried Sub&s;tances, if we con&s;ider al&s;o the various Juices with which &s;everal
parts of the Earth are Furni&s;h'd, Unctuous, Watery, Styptick, Saline, Pe|trifactive,
Corro&s;ive, and what not. There are &s;ome Juices of the Earth
which do, as it were, perpetuate them by turning them into Stone. Others
do &s;o deeply pierce and intimately mix with their parts, that they wholly, as it
were, change the Nature of tho&s;e Sub&s;tances, and de&s;troy that property of
Congruity which all Bodies generated in the Air and Water &s;eem to have,
which are very apt to be di&s;&s;olved and corrupted by innate aerial and aqu ous
Sub&s;tances. Such are all kinds almo&s;t of oleaginous and &s;ulphureous Sub|&s;tances,
and divers &s;aline and mineral Juices. Others indeed do not pre&s;erve
the very Sub&s;tance of tho&s;e Vegetables, but in&s;inuating into the Pores, and
there, as it were, fixing, they retain and perpetuate the Shape and Figure,
but corrupt and di&s;&s;olve the interpos'd part of the Vegetable; of all which
kinds I have &s;een &s;ome Specimina, as I have al&s;o of divers other Sub&s;tances
Pickled, Dried, Candyed, Con&s;erv'd, pre&s;erv'd, or Mummify'd by Nature:
where therefore the Sub&s;tances have happen'd to be bury'd with pre&s;erva|tive
juices, they have with&s;tood the injury of Time; but where tho&s;e Juices
have been wanting, there we find no Foot&s;teps of the&s;e Monuments of
Antiquity.</P>
<P>But to return to what I was pro&s;ecuting, another cau&s;e which may make
alterations on the Surface of the Earth, is any violent motions of the Air,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A 2d Cau&s;e of alteratios on the Earth be|&s;ide Earth|quakes, is vio|lent motions of the Air.</NOTE>
whereby the parts of the Earth, in dry Weather, are tran&s;ported from place
to place in the Form of Du&s;t. Of this kind Travellers tell us very &s;trange Sto|ries
of the removal of the Sands in the De&s;erts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and other De&s;erts
in <HI>Africa;</HI> and we have &s;ome in&s;tances of it here in <HI>England,</HI> to wit, in <HI>Nor|folk</HI>
and <HI>Dev$n&s;hire</HI> (in the former of which there are often found natural
Mummies which have been buried alive by tho&s;e removing Sands, and by their
drine&s;s pre&s;erv'd) But the&s;e greater and more &s;uddain removals of Sand and
Du&s;t are not &s;o univer&s;al, and therefore not &s;o much to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e;
tho' po&s;&s;ibly they may have been more frequent heretofore, which the Layers
of Sands to be found in digging Pitts and Wells &s;eem to hint: But that which
is mo&s;t univer&s;al, is very flow, and almo&s;t inperceptible, and that is the re|moving
of the Du&s;t from the higher Parts, and $ettling in the lower by the
Wind or motion of the Air. This tho' its effects be almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible, yet
being con&s;tant, mu&s;t needs, in length of time, much promote the levelling
and &s;moothing of the Sur&s;ace of the Earth.</P>
<P>I might name al&s;o another cau&s;e of the tran&s;po&s;ition of the &s;uperficial Parts
of the Earth; and that is from the gradual &s;ub&s;iding or &s;inking into the Earth
of the more heavy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3dly, A gradu|al &s;inking of heavy Bodies into the Sur|face.</NOTE> and the Ebullition or re&s;pective ri&s;ing of the more light
Parts upwards. Hence we may ob&s;erve, that many old and va&s;t Buildings
<PB N="317" REF="294">
and Towers have &s;unk into the Earth. And the like we judge of tho&s;e va&s;t
Stones in <HI>Salisbury</HI> Plain, and we find con&s;tantly almo&s;t in all Stone Monu|ments
placed in Church-yards, and in all old Churches unle&s;s placed on a|very
high place, and founded on &s;ome Rock. The Cau&s;e may po&s;&s;ibly have
great Influence where the Earth is very &s;oft, &s;pungy, or boggy; and po&s;&s;ibly
many of tho&s;e Trees which are found in boggy Grounds, may have been bu|ried,
by having been either fell'd, or blown down by Wind, or wa&s;h'd down
by &s;ome Inundation well impregnated with mineral Juices, and &s;o made hea|vier
than the &s;ubjacent Earth, and &s;wallowed into it. Several of the for|mer
Relations do. indeed prety well agree with this Hypothe&s;is; and I am
very apt to think that where the Surface of the Earth has not been much al|ter'd
&s;ince the Creation, if any &s;uch there be, if it were &s;earch'd into it would
be found that the lighte&s;t Parts, lye next the Surface, and &s;o heavier in lower
Parts, which makes me imagine that the natural place of Minerals is very
deep under the Surface of the Earth, and (po&s;&s;ibly) to be found under e|very
&s;tep of Ground, were &s;earch made under it to a &s;ufficient depth; and
that the rea&s;on why we find it &s;ometimes near the Surface of the Earth, as in
Mountains, is not becau&s;e it was there generated, but becau&s;e it has been
by &s;ome former Subterraneous Eruption (by which tho&s;e Hills and Moun|tains
have been made) thrown up towards the Surface of the Earth. And as
Gold is the heavie&s;t, &s;o it is the &s;carce&s;t of all Mettals. And I do not at all
que&s;tion but that there may be other Bodies or Mettals as much heavier
than Gold, as Gold is then common Earth. To make the&s;e Conjectures the
more probable, &s;ee what Sir <HI>Philiberto Vernatti</HI> writes from <HI>Batavia</HI> in the
<HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> in an&s;wer to &s;ome Queries &s;ent him by the Royal Society. &startq;I
have often (&s;ays he) felt Earthquakes here, but they do not continue long.
In the Year 1656, or 57, (I do not remember well the time) <HI>Batavia</HI> was
covered in one Afternoon about two of the Clock, with a black Du&s;t, which
being gathered together, was &s;o ponderous, that it exceeded the weight
in Gold. It is here thought that it came out of a Hill that burneth in <HI>Sumatra</HI>
near <HI>Endrapeor.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e fiery Eruptions in all probability come from a very great depth
and with a great violence; and po&s;&s;ible even that golden Powder that is
&s;ometimes thrown up may have &s;omewhat conduced to the cau&s;e of the vio|lence
of it. We know not what Method Nature may have to prepare an
<HI>Aurum Fulminans</HI> of her own, great quantities of which, being any ways heat|ed
and &s;o fired, may have produced the Powder. However, whether &s;o or
not, it were very well worth trial to examine, whether the Flower that may
be catch'd in a Gla&s;s Body, upon fulminating a quantity of &s;uch Powder gra|dually
by &s;mall parcels, would, by being ordered as common Gold, make a|gain
an <HI>Aurum Fulminans:</HI> Or whether this Fulmination, which is a kind of Infla|ming
of the Body of the Gold, does not make &s;ome very con&s;iderable altera|tion
in the Nature and Texture of it. Since we find that kind of Opera|tion,
to wit, inflaming or burning does con&s;iderably alter the Texture of all
other Bodies &s;o wrought on. This only by the way.</P>
<P>But to proceed to the la&s;t Argument to confirm the 6th Propo&s;ition I at
fir&s;t undertook to prove,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The la&s;t Argu|ment to prove the &s;ixth Pro|po&s;ition from the Shells, &amp;c. found on, and in the Earth.</NOTE> namely, that very many parts of the Surface of the
Earth (not now to take notice of others) have been transform'd tran&s;pos'd
and many ways alter'd &s;ince the fir&s;t Creation of it.) And that which to me
&s;eems the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t cogent Argument of all is this, That at the tops
of &s;ome of the highe&s;t Hills, and in the bottom of &s;ome of the deepe&s;t
Mines, in the mid&s;t of Mountains and Quarries of Stone, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> divers Bodies
have been and daily are found, that if we thoroughly examine we &s;hall find
to be real &s;hells of Fi&s;hes, which for the&s;e following Rea&s;ons we conclude to
have been at fir&s;t generated by the Pla&s;tick faculty of the Soul or Life-prin|ciple
of &s;ome animal, and not from the imaginary influence of the Stars, or
from any Pla&s;tick faculty inherent in the Earth it&s;elf &s;o form'd; the &s;tre&s;s of
which Argument lies in the&s;e Particulars.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="295">
Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t. Proof that they are true Shells.</NOTE> That the Bodies there found have exactly the Form and Matter,
that is, are of the &s;ame kind of Sub&s;tance for all its &s;en&s;ible Properties, and
have the &s;ame External and Internal Figure or Shape with the Shells of Animals.</P>
<P>Next,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d. Proof.</NOTE> That it is contrary to all the other acts of Nature, that does nothing
in vain, but always aims at an end, to make two Bodies exactly of the &s;ame
Sub&s;tance and Figure, and one of them to be wholly u&s;ele&s;s, or at lea&s;t with|out
any de&s;ign that we can with any plau&s;ibility imagine. The Shells of Ani|mals,
to our Rea&s;on, manife&s;tly appear to be done with the greate&s;t Coun|cel
and De&s;ign, and with the mo&s;t excellent contrivance, both for the Conve|nience
and Ornament of that Animal to which it belongs, that the par|ticular.
Structure and Fabrick of that Animal was capable of: Whereas the&s;e
if they were not the Shells of Fi&s;hes, will be nothing but the &s;portings of
Nature, as &s;ome do finely fancy, or the effects of Nature idely mocking
her&s;elf, which &s;eems contrary to her Gravity. But this perhaps may not
&s;eem &s;o cogent, tho', if it be thoroughly con&s;ider'd, there is much weight in
it.</P>
<P>Next therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d. Proof.</NOTE> Wherever Nature does work by peculiar Forms and Sub|&s;tances,
we find that &s;he always joins the Body &s;o fram'd with &s;ome other pe|culiar
Sub&s;tance. Thus the Shells of Animals, whil&s;t they are forming are
join'd with the Fle&s;h of the Animal to which they belong. Peculiar Flowers,
Leaves, and Fruit are appropriated to peculiar Roots, whereas the&s;e on the
contrary are found mixt with all kind of Sub&s;tances, in Stones of all kinds,
in all kinds of Earth, &s;ometimes expos'd to the open Air without any co|herence
to any thing. This is at lea&s;t an Argument that they were not gene|rated
in that po&s;ture they are found; that very probably they have been
heretofore di&s;tinct and di&s;united from the Bodies with which they are now
mixt, and that they were not formed out of the&s;e very Stones or Earth, as &s;ome
Imagine, but deriv'd their Beings from &s;ome preceding Principle.</P>
<P>Fourthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th. Proof.</NOTE> Wherever el&s;e Nature works by peculiar Forms, we find her al|ways
to compleat that form, and not break off abruptly. But the&s;e Shells
that are found in the middle of Stones are mo&s;t of them broken, very few
compleat, nay, I have &s;een many brui&s;ed and flaw'd, and the parts at a
pretty di&s;tance one from another, which is an Argument that they were not
generated in the place where they are found, and in that po&s;ture, but that
they have been &s;ometimes di&s;tinct and di&s;tant from tho&s;e Sub&s;tances, and
then only placed, broken and disfigured by chance, but had a preceeding
and more noble Principle to which they ow'd their Form, and by &s;ome hand
of Providence, were ca&s;t into &s;uch places where they were filled with &s;uch
Sub&s;tances, as in tract of Time have conden&s;ed and hardened into Stone: This, I
think, any impartial Examiner of the&s;e Bodies will ea&s;ily grant to be very prob|able,
e&s;pecially if he take notice of the Circum&s;tances I have already menti|on'd.
Now, if it be granted, that there have been preceding Moulds, and
that the&s;e curiou&s;ly figured Stones do not owe their form to a pla&s;tick or
forming Principle inherent in their Sub&s;tances; why might not the&s;e be &s;uppo&s;ed
Shells, as well as other Bodies of the &s;ame Shape and Sub&s;tance, generated
none knows how, nor can imagine for what.</P>
<P>Further,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th. Proof.</NOTE> if the&s;e be the api&s;h Tricks of Nature, Why does it not imi|tate
&s;everal other of its own Works? Why do we not dig out of Mines ever|la&s;ting
Vegetables, as Gra&s;s for in&s;tance, or Ro&s;es of the &s;ame Sub&s;tance,
Figure, Colour, Smell? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Were it not that the Shells of Fi&s;hes are made
of a kind of &s;tony Sub&s;tance which is not apt to corrupt and decay. Where|as,
Plants and other animal Sub&s;tances, even Bones, Horns, Teeth and
Claws are more liable to the univer&s;al Men&s;truum of Time. 'Tis probable
therefore, that the fixedne&s;s of their Sub&s;tance has pre&s;erved them in their
pri&s;tine Form, and not that a new pla&s;tick Principle has newly generated
<PB N="319" REF="296" MS="Y">
them. Be&s;ides, why &s;hould we not then doubt of all the Shells taken
up by the Sea-&s;hore, or out of the Sea (if they had none when we found
them) whether they ever had any Fifth in them or not? Why &s;hould we not
here conceipt al&s;o a pla&s;tick Faculty di&s;tinct from that of the Life-principle
of &s;ome Animal; is it becau&s;e this is more like a Shell than the other? That
I am &s;ure it cannot be. Is it becau&s;e 'tis more obvious how a Shell should be
placed there? If &s;o, 'twould be as good Rea&s;on to doubt if an Anchor should
be found at the top of a Hill, as the Poet affirms, or an Urn or Coins
buried under Ground, or in the bottom of a Mine, whether it were ever
an Anchor, or an Urne, or a coined Face, or made by the pla&s;tick Faculty
of the Earth, than which what could be more ab&s;urd: And tho&s;e Per&s;ons
that will needs be &s;o over confident of their Omni&s;cience of all that has been
done in the World, or that could be, may, if they will vouch&s;afe, &s;uffer
them&s;elves to be asked a Que&s;tion, Who inform'd them? Who told them where
<HI>England</HI> was before the Flood; nay, even where it was before the <HI>Roman</HI>
Conque&s;t, for about four or five thou&s;and Years, and perhaps much longer;
much more where did they ever read or hear of what <HI>Changes</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;po&s;itions</HI>
there have been of the parts of it before that? What Hi&s;tory informs us of the
burying of tho&s;e Trees in <HI>Cheshire</HI> and <HI>Angle&s;y?</HI> Who can tell when <HI>Tenariff</HI>
was made? And yet we find that mo&s;t judicious Men that have been there
and well con&s;idered the form and po&s;ture of it, conclude it to have been at
fir&s;t that way produced. But I &s;uppo&s;e the most confident will quickly upon
examination, find that there is a defect of Natural Hi&s;tory; if therefore
we are left to conjecture, then that mu&s;t certainly be the be&s;t that is backed
with mo&s;t Rea&s;on, that Clay, and Sand, and common Shells can be chang|ed
and incorporated together into Stones very hard. I have already given
many in&s;tances, and can produce hundreds of others, but that I think it
needle&s;s, that &s;everal parts of the bottom of the Sea have been thrown up
into I&s;lands and Mountains. I have al&s;o given divers In&s;tances, and tho&s;e
&s;ome of them within the Memory of Man, where 'tis not in the lea&s;t to be
doubted but that there may be found &s;ome Ages hence &s;everal Shells at the
tops of tho&s;e Hills there generated; and as little, that if Quarries of Stone
&s;hould be hereafter digged in tho&s;e places, there would be found Shells incorporated
with them; and were they not beholding to this inqui&s;itive and
learned Age for the Hi&s;tory of that Eruption, they might as much won|der
how the&s;e Shells mould come there, and a&s;cribe them to a pla&s;tick Fa|culty,
or &s;ome imaginary Influence, as plau&s;ibly as &s;ome now do. I have al&s;o
&s;hewed, that Water and divers other fluid Sub&s;tances, may be, in tract of
Time, converted into Stone and &s;tony Sub&s;tances; and &s;o &s;uch Liquors pe|netrating
the Pores of the&s;e Shells, and e&s;pecially if they be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the
benumming Steams that &s;ometimes i&s;&s;ue from Subterraneous Erruptions, may
very much contribute to the pre&s;ervation of tho&s;e Shells from Corruption and
crumbling to Du&s;t under the cru&s;hing Foot of Time. Be&s;ides, that the Shells
them&s;elves are &s;o near the Nature and Sub&s;tance of Stone, that they are lit|tle
&s;ubject to the injuries of the Air or Weather; &s;o that the&s;e &s;mall pyrami|dal
Hou&s;es of Shell-Fi&s;hes &s;eem not le&s;s la&s;ting Monuments than tho&s;e va&s;t
piles of Stones erected by the antient Inhabitants of <HI>Egypt,</HI> which outvye
all the more curious Fabricks of <HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Architecture both for their
Antiquity and pre&s;ent Continuance. Nor do they exceed the Works of
Architects for la&s;ting only, but for Ornament, for Strength, and for Convenience.</P>
<P>Now if all the&s;e Bodies have been really &s;uch Shells of Fi&s;hes as they mo&s;t
re&s;emble, and that the&s;e are found at the tops of the most con&s;iderable
Mountains in the World as <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> the <HI>Alps,</HI> the <HI>Andes,</HI> the <HI>Appennine,</HI> and
<HI>pyrrenean</HI> Mountains, to omit other Hills nearer and of le&s;s note, and that
tis not very probable that they were carried thither by Mens Hands, or
by the Deluge of <HI>Noah,</HI> or by any other more probable way than that of
Earthquakes; 'tis a very cogent Argument that the &s;uperficial Parts of
the Earth have been very much changed &s;ince the beginning, that the tops of
Mountains have been under the Water, and con&s;equently al&s;o, that divers
parts of the bottom of the Sea have been heretofore Mountains: For tho' I
<PB N="320" REF="297">
confe&s;s I have but few In&s;tances to prove it, be&s;ides that of <HI>Plato</HI>'s
<HI>Atlantis,</HI> and &s;ome others that I have already mention'd; yet 'tis very
probable, that when&s;oever an Earthquake rai&s;es up a great part of the
Earth in one place, it &s;uffers another to &s;ink in another place; for Gra|vity
is a Principle that will not long suffer a &s;pace to remain unfill'd under &s;o
va&s;t a pile of Earth as a Mountain, unle&s;s the Sub&s;tances, &s;o thrown up, be
of very hard, clo&s;e and va&s;t Stones that may, as it were, vault it: In which
ca&s;es 'tis very, probable (and <HI>Kircher</HI> and divers other Authors that write of
Mines and Quarries, gives us many in&s;tances to confirm it) that the&s;e Cracks
and Cliffs so left, are fill'd up with &s;uch Petrifying or Mineral Waters as do
make great varieties of Stones, Marbles, Sparrs, Caulks, and Ores, and &s;o
there is made a tran&s;position as well as a transformation. Which &s;uppo&s;ition
(by the way) I think will furni&s;h a very probable Rea&s;on of the &s;hape of the
Veins and Cracks of &s;peckled Marbles and other Stones, of the form al&s;o of
the Veins of Ores, Stones, Clays, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the Earth, and of their &s;o mixing
together; of the lying of Mettals in Mountains and other Mines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but
of the&s;e only here by the Bye, becau&s;e I refer what I have to &s;ay of that to
another Subject, <HI>viz.</HI> A Hi&s;tory of the Forms and Proprieties of Minerals and
Metals. To proceed then.</P>
<P>The Seventh Propo&s;ition that I undertook to make probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;eventh Propo&s;ition con|firmed.</NOTE> was, That
'tis very probable that divers of the&s;e Tran&s;po&s;itions and Metamorpho&s;es
have been wrought even here in <HI>England:</HI> Many of its Hills have probably
been heretofore under the Sea, and divers other parts that were heretofore
high Land and Hills, have &s;ince been covered with the Sea. Of the latter of
the&s;e I have given many In&s;tances already, and that which makes the fir&s;t
probable, is the great quantities of Shells that are found in the mo&s;t Inand
Parts of this I&s;land; in the Hills, in the Plains, in the bottoms of Mines and
in the middle of Mountains and Quarries of Stones. Of this kind are tho&s;e
Shells, which any inqui&s;itive Man may find great quantities of in <HI>Portland</HI>-&s;tone,
<HI>Purbeck</HI>-&s;tone? Burford|<HI>&s;tone, Northampton&s;hire</HI>-&s;tone, out of which I have of|ten
pick'd Mu&s;cles, Cockles, Periwinkles, Oy&s;ters, Scallop, and divers o|ther
Shells that are buried in the very Body and Sub&s;tance of the Stone; and
indeed they may be found of &s;ome kind or other in almo&s;t all kinds of Stone.
That the <HI>Kain&s;ham</HI> Snail Stones, and tho&s;e found in &s;everal on her parts of <HI>En|gland,</HI>
have been the Shells of Fi&s;hes, I hope the Arguments I have already
urged may &s;uffice to evince. As al&s;o, that tho&s;e Helmet Stones (of which
&s;ort I my &s;elf have found in many places of <HI>England,</HI> and others have fur|ni&s;h'd
me with many more found in other parts of it) are nothing but the
fillings of the Shells of a &s;ort of Echini or Egg Fi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Now 'tis not probable that other M$ns Hands, or the general Deluge
which la&s;ted but a little while, &s;hould bring them there; nor can I imagine a|ny
more likely and &s;ufficient way than an Earthquake, which might hereto|fore
rai&s;e all the&s;e I&s;lands of Great <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> out of the Sea, as it
did heretofore, of which I have already mentioned the Hi&s;tories; or as it
lately did that I&s;land in the <HI>Canarys</HI> and <HI>Azores,</HI> in the &s;ight of divers who
are yet alive to te&s;tifie the Truth and Manner of it: And po&s;&s;ibly <HI>England</HI>
and <HI>Ireland,</HI> might be rais'd by the &s;ame Earthquake, by which the <HI>Atlantis,</HI> if
we will believe <HI>Plato,</HI> was &s;unk. And I doubt not but any inqui&s;itive Man that
has opportunity of traveling and examining &s;everal of the Mountianous Parts
and Cliffs, and of the Mines, Quarries, and other &s;ubterraneous Parts of
<HI>England,</HI> will meet with a great many other Arguments to confirm this Sup|po&s;ition,
be&s;ides tho&s;e I have already alledg'd: But tho&s;e I hope may &s;uffice
for the pre&s;ent to excite Men to this Curio&s;ity, which was the chief rea&s;on of
this pre&s;ent exerci&s;e. And this makes way for the Eighth Propo&s;ition,
which is</P>
<P>Eighthly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The eighth Pro|po&s;ition con|firmed.</NOTE> That mo&s;t of the&s;e Mountains and Inland places whereon the&s;e kind
of Petrify'd Bodies and Shells are found at pre&s;ent or have been heretofore, were
formerly under the Water, and that either by the de&s;cending of the Waters
to another part of the Earth by the alteration of the Center of Gravity of
<PB N="321" REF="298">
the whole bulk, or rather by the Eruption of &s;ome kind of Subterraneous
Fires or Earthquakes, great quantities of Earth have been de&s;erted by the Wa|ter
and laid bare and dry. That divers places have been thus rai&s;ed by
Earthquakes has been already proved from many Hi&s;tories; and then why
may not all of them have the &s;ame Original, e&s;pecially &s;ince there is no other
more probable Cau&s;e that we know of, that &s;hould convey and place tho&s;e
Shells on the tops of Mountains? That they really are Shells, and have been
the receptacle of Fi&s;hes, I hope the Arguments t have already alledg'd may
&s;uffice to per&s;uade: If then they have been Shells, and have been there
placed, why &s;hould we not conclude that That part hath been under the Wa|ter
with as much rea&s;on as &s;eeing Towers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> under the Water near&mdash;
&mdash;we do that tho&s;e parts have been heretofore above Water, which Hi|stories
inform us of, or as we might have done if we had had none even from
what the thing it&s;elf &s;peaks. I think we may with as much rea&s;on doubt if an
Urn &s;hould be digg'd up full with old Coins, &s;tamped with the lame impre&s;|&s;ion,
made of the &s;ame Sub&s;tance and Magnitude of tho&s;e u&s;ed by the ancient
<HI>Romans,</HI> or any other Nation, of which we have good Hi&s;tory; Fir&s;t, Whether
ever tho&s;e Coins were made by Mens Hands, or by a pla&s;tick Faculty of Na|ture
for it is certainly no more difficult a task for Nature to imitate the
one than the other. And, Secondly, Whether ever that Urn were made and
tho&s;e Coins were put into it and &s;haped by Mens Hands, or that they were
&s;hap'd and thrown into it meerly by Nature; perhaps tho&s;e &s;uppositions
might not be impo&s;&s;ible, but &s;ure all Men will judge them very improbable:
And I think the Ca&s;e in this particular I am &s;peaking of very much the &s;ame.
Fir&s;t, That there is much greater rea&s;on to imagine the Shells &s;o found to
have been the <HI>Exuviae</HI> of &s;ome living Creature, and next, that they have
been placed there where they are found when that part was under Water,
and that part to have &s;ince been rais'd up to that height above the Sea by &s;ome
preceding Earthquake. There is no Coin can &s;o well inform an Antiquary
that there has been &s;uch or &s;uch a place &s;ubject to &s;uch a Prince, as the&s;e
will certify a Natural Antiquary, that &s;uch and &s;uch places have been under
the Water, that, there have been &s;uch kind of Animals, that there have been
&s;uch and &s;uch preceding Alterations and Changes of the &s;uperficial Parts of
the Earth: And methinks Providence does &s;eem to have de&s;ign'd the&s;e per|manent
&s;hapes, as Monuments and Records to in&s;truct &s;ucceeding Ages of
what pa&s;t in preceding. And the&s;e written in a more legible Character than
the Hieroglyphicks of the ancient <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and on more la&s;ting Monuments
than tho&s;e of their va&s;t Pyramids and Obelisks. And I find that tho&s;e that
have well con&s;ider'd and &s;tudy'd all the remarkable Circum&s;tances to be met
with at <HI>Teneriffe</HI> and <HI>Fayale,</HI> do no more doubt that tho&s;e va&s;t Pikes have been
rai&s;ed up by the Eruption of Fire out of their tops than others that have
&s;urvey'd the Pyramids of <HI>Egypt,</HI> or the Stones on <HI>Salisbury</HI> Plain do doubt
that they have been the effects of Man's Labours. And they do it with as
much rea&s;on; for all Conclu&s;ions that are not immediately grounded on
Sen&s;e, or the re&s;ult of it are but Hypothetical and from a Similitude; for
&s;ince it has been heretofore and lately &s;een, that &s;uch Eruptions have pro|duc'd
such kind of Hills and I&s;lands, and that the tops, of the&s;e Hills do as
yet born, and that there are all about the &s;ides of them huge Stones and
Rocks, and even Mountains lying in Po&s;tures as if they had been tumbled
down from the top; 'tis a rational Conclu&s;ion to &s;ay, that 'tis very probable
the&s;e have had the &s;ame Original with tho&s;e.</P>
<P>But as to tho&s;e va&s;t tracts of Ground that lye very far from the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Change of the Earths Cent$$ of Gravity hinted.</NOTE> it
may perhaps to some &s;eem not impossible, that the Center of Gravity or
Method of the attraction of the Globe of the Earth may change and shift
places, and if so, then certainly all the fluid parts of the Earth will conform
thereto, and then 'twill follow that one part will be cover'd and overflow'd
by the Sea that was before dry, and another part be di&s;cover'd and laid dry
that was before overwhelm'd. Now, tho' this Conjecture may at fir&s;t
reading &s;eem a little extravagant, yet if we con&s;ider, that as great altera|tions
have been really ob&s;erv'd, we may a little moderate a two &s;evere Cen|&s;ure

That the Magnetical Poles and Meridians of the Earth have been al|ter'd,
and that they do at this pre&s;ent continue to do &s;o is granted almo&s;t
by all, and confirmed by a multitude of Ob&s;ervations made in divers Parts of
the World, and by collecting and comparing the Ob&s;ervations I have met
with&punc; I &s;uppo&s;e the Pole of the Magneti&s;m to be at a certain di&s;tance from
the Pole of its daily Motion, and that it does move round that Pole at a cer|tain
di&s;tance in a certain number of Years, and that it does annually pro|ceed
in this Circle &s;ome parts of a Degree: So that whereas the Magnetical
Pole was formerly North-Ea&s;t of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> it is now grown North-We&s;t of it,
and a little to the We&s;tward even of <HI>England</HI>'s Meridian. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Petit</HI>
Engenier to the <HI>French</HI> King, is of Opinion, That the Pole of the diurnal
motion of the Earth alters, but I confe&s;s I cannot in the lea&s;t a&s;&s;ent to it
from any of tho&s;e Arguments that he alledges, but I do rather think that
divers or them do make again&s;t his Hypothe&s;s; yet 'tis not impo&s;&s;ible but
that a very great Earthquake altering the Center of Gravity, may al&s;o alter
the Pole of Rotation; for we find by experience, that if any thing be laid
upon one &s;ide of a large <HI>Lignum Vitae</HI> Ball &s;u&s;pended by a String, and that Ball
be turned round upon the String, it &s;hall not turn exactly about the Point
by which 'tis &s;u&s;pended, but about &s;ome other Point. Be&s;ides this, we know
that the direction of the&s;e Poles, as to the Heavens, doth vary, for whereas,
it pointed at a part of the Heavens many degrees di&s;tant from the Star in
the top of the tail of the little Bear, now it points almo&s;t directly towards
it. Be&s;ides this, we find that the Points of the Inter&s;ection of the Aequinoctial
and Ecliptick varies, and po&s;&s;ibly even the motions of all may vary. A diurnal
Revolution of the Earth may perhaps have been made in a much &s;horter time
than now; po&s;&s;ibly there may have been the &s;ame alterations in the Annual,
and then a Year, or a Day at the beginning of the World would not be of &s;o
long a duration as now when tho&s;e motions are grown &s;lower; for if the
motions of the Heavens be analogous to the motion of a Wheel or Top, as
I think I can by very many Arguments make probable, then if the Earth
were (as it were) at fir&s;t &s;et up or put into a rapid circular Motion, like
that of a Top, 'tis probable that the fluid Medium in which it moves, may
after a thou&s;and Revolutions, a little retard and &s;laken that motion, and
if &s;o, then a longer &s;pace of time will pa&s;s while it makes i$s Revolution
now than it did at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Hence po&s;&s;ibly the long Lives of the Po&s;terity of <HI>Adam</HI> before the Flood,
might be of no greater duration then Mens Lives are ordinarily now;<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ the old $word$ lived no longer in $word$ &s;en&s;e the$$ Men do now.</NOTE> for
though perhaps they might number more Revolutions of the Sun, or more
Years than we can now, yet our few Years may comprehend as great a &s;pace
of time; this perhaps might de&s;erve to be inquired into had we a certain
mea&s;ure of time, &s;uch as &s;ome would have a &s;tanding Pendulum of a certain
length; but &s;ince we are upon &s;u&s;pecting, we may even doubt whether the
power of Gravity it&s;elf may not alter in time; we find that the Poles of the
Load&s;tone may be changed, that it does take up more at one time than ano|ther;
that its virtue may be wholly de&s;troyed by Fire, and &s;ome other
ways; and be&s;ides that, one of the&s;e changes is really wrought in the Earth,
and therefore 'tis not impo&s;&s;ible but that even the attractive Power of the
Earth (tho' I confe&s;s I think it quite differing from that of the Load&s;tone)
may be intended or remitted; if &s;o then the Pendulum will be no cer|tain
Standard for the examination of the length of Time by; for the more
the gravitating Power is increas'd, the quicker will be the Vibrations of a|ny
Pendulum and the more weak it is, the &s;lower are the Vibrations: But
this Digre&s;&s;ion only by the bye. To return then, I &s;ay, tho' &s;omewhat may
be &s;aid for this Suppo&s;ition I have &s;tarted, yet I confe&s;s I do more incline to
believe that what Mutations there have been of the Superficial Parts, have
been rather caus'd by Earthquakes and Eruptions, which u&s;hers in my Ninth
Propo&s;ition. Namely,</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="302">
That it &s;eems very probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ninth Pro|po&s;ition confirmed.</NOTE>

$word$ into the Air at &s;uch time as the Sea is inrag'd with Tempe&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&endq;
Be&s;ides, how well do their Actions agree with the Effects of Earthquakes,
for they are &s;aid to throw up burning Trees again&s;t Heaven, and huge Rocks
and va&s;t Hills, which falling into the Sea became I&s;lands, and lighting on the
Land became Mountains. Nor does the manner of their Generation
&s;peak le&s;s, for they are &s;aid to be generated by the Blood of Hea|ven
falling down on the Earth, that is, by the heat or influence of the Ce|le&s;tial
Bodies operating within the Bowels of the Earth, and brought forth
of her Womb in revenge to the Gods, or that they break forth with &s;uch hor|ror
and violence as if they threatned the Heavens. And he that &s;hall
read the De&s;cription of the mo&s;t notable of them <HI>Typheus,</HI> and compare it with
the natural De&s;cription of an Earthquake, will ea&s;ily explicate the &s;everal
parts of the Poets my&s;tical De&s;criptions.</P>
<P>This Theory which I have endeavoured hitherto to evince, tho' indeed it
be very hard po&s;itively to prove, we being, as I in&s;tanced before, very def|icient
in Natural Hi&s;tory, yet if we con&s;ider what has been already &s;aid, and
compare it with the late Ob&s;ervations of divers Travailers over them, we
may find it altogether more than probable. I have been inform'd by &s;everal
worthy Per&s;ons, that there are great &s;tore of Shells found at the tops of the
<HI>Alps, Appenine</HI> and <HI>Pyrenean</HI> Hills, which are by much the highe&s;t of <HI>Europe.</HI> And
I have now by me &s;everal of tho&s;e Shells which have been dug out of them
and brought into <HI>England.</HI> If therefore the&s;e have been real Oy&s;ter-Shells
and Scallop-Shells as upon viewing the Sub&s;tance and Make of them, I &s;ee
not the lea&s;t cau&s;e to doubt; and that there are great quantities of them
to be found in divers Parts which lye buried in the Cliffs and incorporated with
the Stones; and if that the&s;e Mountains have been infe&s;ted with Earth|quakes
both formerly and lately, as we have &s;everal Hi&s;tories that te&s;tifie;
and if that other Eruptions and Earthquakes have rai&s;ed Mountains even
out of the bottom of the Sea, and that the power of included Fire is &s;uf|ficient
to move and rai&s;e even a whole Country all at once for &s;ome hundreds
of Miles, as Hi&s;torians a&s;&s;ure us: If to this we add the univer&s;al &s;ilence in
Hi&s;tory of any part of <HI>Europe,</HI> or any of other certain places of the World
before the Flood, or indeed for almo&s;t two hundred Years after the Flood, I
think there will be much le&s;s &s;cruple to grant it propable that the <HI>Alps,</HI> and
divers other high Mountains, on who&s;e tops are found &s;uch numbers and va|rieties
of Sea-Shells, may have been heretofore rai&s;ed np from under the Sea,
and now &s;u&s;tain'd by the &s;inking of other Parts into the places from whence
they were rai&s;ed. This the very form of them will al&s;o very much argue for;
for I have been inform'd by &s;everal that took diligent notice of it, that the
parts are continually tumbling down from the higher parts to the lower, and
that &s;ome of them do &s;eem to overhang very &s;trangely, which cannot in any
probability be imagin'd to be the form of the fir&s;t Creation, it being con|trary
to that implanted Power of Gravity, whereby all the parts of it are
held together and equally drawn towards the Center of it, and &s;o all the
parts of it ought to have been placed in their natural po&s;ition which mu&s;t
have con&s;tituted an exact Sphere, the heavie&s;t lowe&s;t, and lighter at the top
and the Water must have covered the whole Surface of the Earth, which
&s;eems to have been indeed their fir&s;t po&s;ition, according to the De&s;cription
of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> be&s;ides all tho&s;e Hills that have been made by &s;ubterra|neous
Eruptions are of the like Structure; &s;uch as the <HI>Pike</HI> of <HI>Tenariffe,</HI> the
<HI>Pike</HI> of <HI>Fayale,</HI> the new Mountain in <HI>Italy, Aetna</HI> and <HI>Ve&s;uvius,</HI> all which
&s;eem to have been made up of great Stones thrown up out of the Mouth of
their &s;everal Vulcans, many of which lie in &s;uch tottering po&s;trures that oft
times they tumble down to the bottom, and make great de&s;truction of the
parts beneath; of this we have lately had &s;everal memorable Examples. To
mention only two of three, we are inform'd by Hi&s;torians, that among the
<PB N="325" REF="304" MS="Y">
<HI>Alps</HI> in the <HI>Gii&s;ons</HI> Country, a Town named <HI>Plura,</HI> &s;eated in a Plain at the
Foot of the <HI>Alps</HI> near the Hiver <HI>Maira,</HI> and continuing by e&s;timation at the
time of its fatal Cata&s;trophy, at lea&s;t fifteen hundred People was, by the fal|ling
down of a great part of a huge high Mountain that hung over the &s;aid
place upon the twenty &s;ixth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1617, together with the Inhabitants,
in a moment cru&s;ht and buried deep in the Earth, and that there is nothing
now left in the place thereof but a va&s;t aby&s;s or bottomle&s;&s; Gulf. And
we are now newly inform'd by Letters brought out of <HI>Italy</HI> that a great part
of the City of <HI>Ragu&s;a</HI> has been this Year de&s;troyed by the like falling down of
&s;ome part of the Mountain above it.</P>
<P>The Tenth and la&s;t Conjecture which I &s;hall at pre&s;ent mention (as re&s;erv|ing
&s;ome others which will &s;eem at fir&s;t &s;ight much more &s;trange and extra|vagant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The tenth Pro|po&s;ition confimed.</NOTE>
till I can by a &s;ufficient number of Ob&s;ervations make them more
plau&s;ible) is, that it &s;eems not improbable but that the great&s;t part of the
inequality of the Earths Surface may have proceeded from the &s;ubver&s;ions and
over turnings of &s;ome preceeding Earthquakes.</P>
<P>And for making this Conjecture probable, I might repeat all the Arguments
I have already urged to make probable the Generations of I&s;lands, Moun|tains,
Aby&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but that I &s;uppo&s;e will be needle&s;s, they having been &s;o
lately mention'd. I could al&s;o in&s;tance in a multitude of other &s;maller effects
produced by Earthquakes, of making the Surface of the Earth irregular; but
tho&s;e are &s;o numerous, and &s;o very well known in tho&s;e places where Earth|quakes
are more frequent, as in <HI>Italy, Turky,</HI> the Ea&s;t and We&s;t <HI>Indies,</HI> &amp;c.
that I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on them. To this I might add the universality of Earth|quakes,
there being no part of the World of which we have any good account,
but we find to have been &s;ome time or other &s;haken by Earthquakes; and 'tis
very probable had we receiv'd any certain account of the State and Con&s;titu|tion,
and being of the Earth in its Infancy (as I may &s;ay) or fir&s;t Being of the
Earth after its Creation, when 'tis not improbable but the parts of it that lay
uppermo&s;t and next the other were more fluid and soft, we might have had
a thou&s;and otherob&s;ervables. Of which I &s;hall say more hereafter when I men|tion
&s;ome other Conjectures.</P>
<P>Thus much only I &s;hall add at pre&s;ent, that from what I have in&s;tanced a|bout
Petrifactions and the hardning of &s;everal Sub&s;tances, it &s;eems very pro|bable,
that in the beginning the Earth con&s;i&s;ted for the mo&s;t part of fluid
Sub&s;tances, which by degrees have &s;etled, congealed, and concreted, and
turn'd into Stones, Minerals, Mettals, Clays, Earth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And that in pro|ce&s;s
of time the parts of it have by degrees concreted and lo&s;t their Fluidity,
and that the Earth it&s;elf doth wax old almo&s;t in the &s;ame manner as Ani|mals
and Vegetables do; that is, that the moi&s;ture of it doth by degrees de|cay
and wa&s;t either into Air, and from thence into the Aether; or el&s;e by
degrees the Parts communicating their motion to the Fluidether either grow
movele&s;s and hard, almo&s;t in the &s;ame manner as we find the Bodies of Ani|mals
and Vegetables when they grow old in their &s;everal proportinate times,
all the Parts tend and end in &s;olidity and fixtne&s;s, the Gelly becomes Gri&s;tles,
and the Gri&s;tles a Bone, and the Bone at length a Stone, the Skin from &s;mooth
and &s;oft grows rough and hard, the motions grow &s;low, and the moveable
Parts and Joints grow &s;tiff, and all the Juices decay and are deficient. The
&s;ame thing happens in Trees and other Vegetables. If therefore the Parts of
the Earth have formerly, in all probability, been &s;ofter, how much more
powerful might Earthquakes be then in breaking, rai&s;ing, overturning, and
otherwi&s;e changing the &s;uperficial Parts of the Earth? Be&s;ides, 'tis, not un|likely
but Earthquakes might then be much more frequent before the Fuels
of tho&s;e &s;ubterraneous Fires were much &s;pent. That the Farts of the Earth
do continually grow harder and fixt and concrete into Stone, I think no one
will deny that has con&s;ider'd the Con&s;titution of Mountains, the Layers and
Veins of them, the Sub&s;tances mixt with them, the Layers of the &s;everal
Earths, Sands, Clays, Stones, Minerals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that are met with in diging
Mines and Wells, The Nature of Petrifying Waters, the &s;hapes of Cry&s;tals&punc;
Ores, Talks, Sparrs, and mo&s;t kind of precious Stones,
Marbles Flint&punc;
<PB N="326" REF="305">
Chalk, and the like, every of which are by their forms &s;ufficiently di&s;co|ver'd
to have been formerly fluid Bodies, and whil&s;t fluid, &s;haped into tho&s;e
forms: One or two undeniable In&s;tances I &s;hall add of the fluidity of Flints,
and that &s;hall be that I have now by me, a Flint that has &s;o perfectly filled
the Shell of an <HI>Eeknius,</HI> and inclo&s;ed it al&s;o that it has received; all the im|pre&s;&s;ions
of the cracks of the Shells both on the Concave and Convex Part
thereof, and has exactly filled all the Holes and Pores there of, and has &s;o
perfectly received all the &s;hape thereof as if it were nothing but Plai&s;ter of
<HI>Paris</HI> tempered, Wax, or Sulphur that had been melted and ca&s;t on it; not|with&s;tanding
which it is a Flint &s;o hard as to cutGla&s;s very readily, and is of
a very &s;ingular and uniform Texture; to this I might add many others of
the like kind, which have the impre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e and other Shells, and yet
are, &s;ome Marble, &s;ome Pebbles, &s;ome Agats, &s;ome Marcha&s;ites, &s;ome Ores,
&s;ome Cry&s;tals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some Flints I have marked with impre&s;&s;ions as exactly as
if they had been <HI>&s;oft</HI> Wax &s;tamp'd with a Seal.</P>
<P>Further, That the Subterraneous Fuels do al&s;o wa&s;t and decay, is as evi|dent
from the extinction and cea&s;ing of &s;everal Vulcans that have heretofore
raged, which Con&s;iderations may afford us &s;ufficient Arguments to believe
that Earthquakes have heretofore, not only been much more frequent and
univer&s;al, but much more powerful. If to this we do add what I formerly
mention'd, that there &s;eems to be no other, more probable and intelligible
Cau&s;e in Nature of the inequality of the Earths Surface, the natural Principle
of Gravity reducing the Parts of it as near to an exact &s;pherical Figure as
their Solidity and forc'd Po&s;tures will permit, and con&s;equently (as I men|tion'd
before) the natural form produce'd by Gravity would be a multitude of
Spherical Shells concreted of the &s;everal Sub&s;tances of which it con&s;i&s;ts, in|campa&s;&s;ing
each other, not unlike the Orbits or Shells (for we have no pro|per
name for that kind of hollow Spherical Figure) of an Onion, or as the
<HI>Ptalemaiick</HI> A&s;tronomers do fancy the &s;olid Orbs of the Heavens, ranged e|very one in its di&s;tinct Order according to its Den&s;ity and Gravity; that is,
that which hath been heavie&s;t would have approach'd neare&s;t the Center,
or at lea&s;t neare&s;t to that part which is attractive and the cau&s;e of Gravita|tion,
if &s;uch a Body there be in the middle of the Earth, and the next lighter
in the &s;econd place, and &s;o on to the third, fourth, fifth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> according to
their &s;everal degrees of Gravity and Den&s;ity, they would have taken their
&s;everal Quarters, and &s;o Water would always have covered the Face of the
Earth, and the lighted Liquor would always have been at the top, and the
Air above that, and Aether above that; and as in Fluids &s;o al&s;o in Solids, the
Shells of Gold would have been the lowe&s;t of any Body we yet know, that of
Quick&s;ilver next, that of Lead next, and &s;o the re&s;t in their order, which
&s;eems al&s;o really to have been the form of the Earth, till di&s;turbed by Earth|quakes,
which I conceive to be the rea&s;on of the &s;carcity of tho&s;e heavy Bo|dies
of Metal near the Surface, and of the greatest &s;carcity of Gold which is
the mo&s;t heavy, and that it is not to be found but in &s;uch places where there
have in probability been great &s;ubver&s;ions by Earthquakes, as in Mountains,
or in Rivers running out of Mountains, or in Earth wa&s;ht and tumbled down
from Mountains, and &s;uch like places, as by many Circum&s;tances may be
gue&s;t to have been formerly deeper under the Surface of the Earth.</P>
<P>There is yet one Argument more that to me &s;eems very good, and that is
fetcht from no le&s;s di&s;tance than the Moon and the Sun by the help of Te|le&s;copes.
The&s;e Bodies, as I have formerly hinted in the latter end of my
Micrography, &s;eem to have the fame Principle of Gravity as the Earth, which,
as I have there argued, &s;eems probable from their Spherical Figure in gene|ral,
and the &s;everal inequalities in particular, vi&s;ible by the help of Tele|&s;copes
on the Surface of the Moon, and the &s;everal Smoaks, and Clouds,
and Spots that appear on the Surface of the Sun; and as they have that
Principle in common with the Earth, &s;o it &s;eems to me that they are not
Free from the like motions with tho&s;e of an Earthquake: For as to the Moon
tis ea&s;ily to be perceiv'd through a Tele&s;cope, that the whole Surface of it
is covered over with a multitude of &s;mall Pits or Cavities which are in|compa&s;&s;ed
round with a kind of protuberant Brim, much like the Cavities
<PB N="327" REF="306">
or &s;mall Pits, which are left in a Pot of Alaba&s;ter Du&s;t boyled dry by the
Vapours which break out of the Body it by the heat of the Fire; and
all the inequalities that appear on the Surface of that Body, &s;eem, by their
form, to have been caus'd by an Eruption of the Moon, &s;omewhat Analo|gous
to our Earthquakes; all tho&s;e Pits in the Moon being much like the Cal|dera
or Vent at the top of Vulcans here on the Earth, or like tho&s;e little
Pits left at the top or &s;urface of the Alaba&s;ter Du&s;b by the natural &s;ub&s;iding
of that Du&s;t in the place where the Vapours generated within the Body of
it break out. I need not, I think, &s;pend time in urging Arguments to prove
the &s;ufficient powerfulne&s;s of the Cau&s;e to produce Effects as great as any I
have a&s;cribed to it, as being able to rai&s;e as great and high Mountains
as tho&s;e of the <HI>Alps, Andes, Cauca&s;us, Montes Lunae,</HI> &amp;c. e&s;pecially &s;ince even
of late we are often informed of as great effects el&s;ewhere, and even of the
&s;haking and moving tho&s;e va&s;t Mountains by our latter and more debilitated
Earthquakes, tho' tho&s;e Mountains are now in probability much more com|pacted
and tenacious by the &s;ince acquired Petrifaction, than they were be|fore
their fir&s;t accumulation; and tho' 'tis not unlikely but the Fuel or Cau&s;e
of the Subterraneous Fire may be much wafted and &s;pent by preceding Con|flagarations;
Yet po&s;&s;ibly there may be yet left in other Parts &s;ufficient
Mines to produce very great effects if they &s;hall by any accident take Fire;
and 'tis not impo&s;&s;ible but that there may be &s;ome Cau&s;es that generate and
renew the Fuel, as there are others that &s;pend and con&s;ume it.</P>
<P>From all which Propo&s;itions, if at lea&s;t they are true, will follow many o|thers
meer Corollaries which may be deduced from them.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Corollairs from the fore|going Propo&s;i|tions.</NOTE> ei|their
&s;wallowed up into the Earth, or &s;unk so low as to be drown'd by the
coming in of the Sea, or divers other ways quite destroyed; <HI>as Plato</HI>'s <HI>Atlan|tis, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, That there, many have been as many Countries new made and<MILESTONE N="2">
produced by being rai&s;ed from under the Water, or from the inward or hid|den
Parts of the Body of the Earth, as <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, That there may have been divers Species of things wholly de|&s;troyed<MILESTONE N="3">
and annihilated, and divers others changed and varied, for &s;ince we
find that there are &s;ome kinds of Animals and Vegetables peculiar to certain
places, and not to be found el&s;ewhere; if &s;uch a place have been &s;wallowed
up, 'tis not improbable but that tho&s;e Animal Beings may have been de|&s;troyed
with them; and this may be true both of aerial and aquatick Animals:
For tho&s;e animated Bodies, whether Vegetables or Animals which were na|turally
nouri&s;hed or refre&s;h'd by the Air would be de&s;troy'd by the Water.
And this I imagine to be the rea&s;on why we now find the Shells of divers Fi|&s;hes Petrify'd in Stone, of which we have now none of the &s;ame kind. As
divers of tho&s;e Snake or Snail Stones, as they call them, whereof great va|rieties
are found about <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ome in <HI>Portland,</HI> dug out of the very
mid&s;t of the Quary of a prodigious bigne&s;s, one of which I have weighing
near Pound weight, being in Diameter about Inches, which
I obtain'd from the Honourable <HI>Henry Howard</HI> of <HI>Norfolk:</HI> We have
Stories that there have been Giants in former Ages of the World, and 'tis
not impo&s;&s;ible but that &s;uch there may have been, and that they may have
been all de&s;troyed, both they and their Country by an Earthquake, and the
Poets &s;eem to hint as much by their <HI>Gigantomachia.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, That there may have been divers new varieties generated of the<MILESTONE N="4">
&s;ame Species, and that by the change of the Soil on which it was produced;
for &s;ince we find that the alteration of the Climate, Soil and Nouri&s;hment doth
often produce a very great alteration in tho&s;e Bodies that &s;uffer it; 'tis not to be
doubted but that alterations al&s;o of this Nature may cau&s;e a very great change
in the &s;hape, and other accidents of an animated Body. And this I imagine
to be the rea&s;on of that great variety of Creatures that do properly belong
<PB N="328" REF="307">
to one Species; as for in&s;tance, In Dogs, Sheep, Goats Deer, Hawks, Pi|geons,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> for &s;ince it is found that they generate upon each other, and that
variety of Climate and Nouri&s;hment doth vary &s;everal accidents in their
&s;hape, if the&s;e or any other animated Body be thus tran&s;planted, 'tis not un|likely
but that the like variation may follow; and hence I &s;uppo&s;e 'tis that
I find divers kinds of Petrify'd Shells, of which kind we have none now na|turally
produced; of this &s;ort are 'many of tho&s;e Helmet Stones which have
been made the Petrifactions of Sub&s;tances in the Shells of &s;everal &s;orts of
<HI>Echini,</HI> who&s;e short have been de&s;troyed by the alteration of the Nature of
that part of the Sea where they were produced; and hence 'tis we find &s;carce
any Shell-Fi&s;h in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sea that has a Shell like tho&s;e &s;orts of <HI>Nautili;</HI>
from whence our <HI>Kein&s;ham</HI> and other &s;orts of Snake-Stones are produced.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="5">Fifthly, 'Tis not impo&s;&s;ible but that there may have been a preceding
learned Age wherein po&s;libly as many things may have been known as are now,
and perhaps many more, all the Arts cultivated and brought to the greate&s;t
Perfection, Mathematicks, Mechanicks, Literature, Mu&s;ick, Opticks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
reduced to their highe&s;t pitch, and all tho&s;e annihilated, de&s;troyed and lo&s;t
by &s;ucceeding Deva&s;tations. Atomical Philo&s;ophy &s;eems to have been better
undertood in &s;ome preceding time, as al&s;o the A&s;tronomy evinc'd by <HI>Coper|nicus</HI>
the <HI>Aegyptian,</HI> and <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Hi&s;tories tell us of many thou&s;and Years more
than ever we in Europe heard of by our Writings, if their Chronology may
be granted, which indeed there is great rea&s;on to que&s;tion.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6">Sixthly, 'Tis not impo&s;&s;ible but that this may have been the cau&s;e of a to|tal
Deluge, which may have cau&s;ed a de&s;truction of all things then living in
the Air: For if Earthquakes can rai&s;e the Surface of the Earth in one place
and &s;ink it in another &s;o as to make it uneven and rugged with Hills and Pits,
It may on the contrary level tho&s;e Mountains again, and fill tho&s;e Pits, and
reduce the Body of the Earth to its primitive roundne&s;s, and then the Wa|ters
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily cover all the Face of the Earth as well as it did in the
beginning of the World, and by this means not only a learned Age may be
wholly annihilated, and no relicks of it left, but al&s;o a great number of the
Species of Animals and Plants. And 'tis not improbable but in the Flood of
<HI>Noah,</HI> the Omnipotent might make u&s;e of this means to produce that great
effect which de&s;troyed all Fle&s;h, and every living thing, &s;ave what was &s;aved
alive in the Ark.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="7">Seventhly, 'Tis not impo&s;&s;ibie but that &s;ome of the&s;e great alterations may
have alter'd al&s;o the magnetical Directions of the Earth; &s;o that what is now
under the Pole or Aequator, or any other Degree of Latitude may have for|merly
been under another; for &s;ince 'tis probable that divers of the&s;e parts
that have &s;uch a Quality may have been tran&s;pos'd, 'tis not unlikely but that
the magnetick Axis of the whole may be alter'd by it, after the fame manner
as we may find by experiment on a Load&s;tone, that the breaking off and
tran&s;po&s;ing the parts of it, do cau&s;e a variation of the magnetick Axis.</P>
<P>I could proceed to &s;et down a great many other Corollarys that would na|turally
follow from the&s;e Principles if certainly proved. But this E&s;&s;ay I inten|ded
only as a hint or memorandum to &s;uch Gentlemen as travel or any other
inqui&s;itive Per&s;ons, who for the future may have better opportunities of making
Ob&s;ervations of this kind, that they may be hereby excited, or at lea&s;t in|treated
to take notice of &s;uch Phaenomena as may clear this Inquiry tho' never
&s;o &s;eemingly mean and trivial, &s;ince it &s;eems not improbable but that they may

any other Observations what&s;oever, and that thence may flow &s;uch in&s;tructi|ons

<P>I Am not, I &s;uppo&s;e, the only Per&s;on who hath heard &s;ome Per&s;ons (with
what Rea&s;on I di&s;pute not) ask what the <HI>Royal Society hath done for &s;o many Years</HI> as they have met.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Vindication of the Royal So|ciety.</NOTE> And other Per&s;ons as confidently affirm that they
have done <HI>ju&s;t nothing.</HI> Nor am I ignorant that the &s;ame Reflections have
been made upon me in particular with more &s;evere Aggravations. As to
what concerns my &s;elf I &s;hall not now &s;pend time in an&s;wering, de&s;igning to
do it by another way. But as to what concerns this Honourable Society, I
conceive it might be a &s;atisfactory An&s;wer to a&s;&s;ure &s;uch Objectours that this
<HI>Society</HI> have been imployed in collecting &s;uch. <HI>Observations,</HI> and making &s;uch
<HI>Experiments</HI> and <HI>Trials</HI> as being fitly apply'd and judiciou&s;ly made u&s;e of, will
very much tend to the advancement of <HI>Natural Knowledge:</HI> And tho' the
things &s;o collected may of them&s;elves &s;eem but like a rude heap of unpoli&s;h'd
and un&s;hap'd Materials, yet for the mo&s;t part they are &s;o qualified as that
they may be fit for the beginning, at lea&s;t of a &s;olid, firm and la&s;ting Structure
of Philosophy.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e &s;ome of tho&s;e may doubt whether really there be any &s;uch Col|lection
made, and more of the practicablene&s;s of making &s;uch a U&s;e and Ap|plication
of them, and will not acquie&s;ce and be &s;atisfied with the effects here|of
that future times may produce, but are de&s;irous to &s;ee &s;ome <HI>Specimen</HI> of
what may be hoped for, by &s;eeing the Ground de&s;igned and &s;et out, the Foun|dation
laid, and the Workmen beginning to rai&s;e the Walls, and make u&s;e
of the Materials that are &s;aid to be got in readine&s;s for &s;uch a Fabrick.</P>
<P>I conceive, it may not be altogether un&s;ea&s;onable this following Year nor
improper for this <HI>Honourable Society's Care</HI> to make &s;ome attempt of that kind
by &s;hewing &s;ome <HI>Specimen</HI> of &s;uch a Structure rai&s;ed from Ob&s;ervations and
Collections of their own, that it may appear that they have not di&s;quieted
them&s;elves in vain, in heaping up &s;uch a Trea&s;ure which they know not who
&s;hall enjoy or make u&s;e of; that is, to &s;ee whether any of the&s;e things they
have been collecting, will afford &s;uifficient Evidence to ground a deduction of
a higher Nature upon, &s;uch as is more ob&s;cure to be &s;een, or more dififcult to
be a&s;certained of, to &s;ee whether, when a weight comes to be laid open the
Stones or the Bricks, the natural Ob&s;ervations, or the Artificial Trials and
Experiments, they will not cru&s;h under it, and fail of &s;ufficient Solidity;
and if they do, whether &s;uch may not be fit for other places, and whether it
will not be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;eek out for &s;ome others that may be more firm and
&s;olid, and &s;uch as are of a clo&s;er and better concocted qualification, which
may be more powerful to &s;u&s;taine a higher Super&s;tructure, and a greater
weight of Argument to be laid upon them.</P>
<P>In order to this it is nece&s;&s;ary (for the Architects lea&s;t) to know, 1<HI>st.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What makes a Collecton of Ex|periments Ob&s;ervations u&s;e|ful.</NOTE>

and Care; a Collection, tho' very great, made at a venture mu&s;t needs con|tain
abundance of &s;uch as will be of little u&s;e for the end aimed at, and not
only &s;o, but will al&s;o prove a great Ob&s;truction and Confu&s;ion in finding out
&s;uch as are proper, and in &s;eparating the Good from the Bad.</P>
<P>The Structure aimed at, is a true and certain knowledge of the Works of
Nature, and this is de&s;igned to be attained as fa&s;t as may be, and to be per|fected
as far as may be; or the end of the Inqui&s;ition is the promotion and
increa&s;ing of Natural Knowledge.</P>
<P>The methods of attaining this end may be two,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Analytick Method.</NOTE> either the Analytick, or the
Synthetick. The firft is the proceeding from the Cau&s;es to the Effects. The
&s;econd from the Effects to the Cau&s;es: The former is the more difficult, and
&s;uppo&s;es the thing to be already done and known, which is the thing &s;ought
and to be found out; this begins from the highe&s;t, mo&s;t general and univer|&s;al
Principles or Cau&s;es of Things, and branches it&s;elf out into the more par|ticular
and &s;ubordinate.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is the more proper for experimental Inquiry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Synthetick Method.</NOTE> which from a
true information of the Effect by a due proce&s;s, finds not the immediate
Cau&s;e thereof, and &s;o proceeds gradually to higher and more remote Cau&s;es
and Powers effective, founding its Steps upon the lowe&s;t and more immediate
Conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>An Inqui&s;ition by the former Method is re&s;embled fitly enough by that
Example of an Architect, who hath a full comprehen&s;ion of what he de&s;igns
to do and acts accordingly: But the latter is more properly re&s;embled to
that of a Husbandman or Gardener, who prepares his Ground and &s;ows his
Seed, and diligently cheri&s;hes the growing Vegetable, &s;upplying it continu|ally
with fitting Moi&s;ture, Food, Shelter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> ob&s;erving and cheri&s;hing its
continual Progre&s;&s;ion, till it comes to its perfect Ripene&s;s and Maturity, and
yields, him the Fruit of his Labour. Nor is it to be expected that a Pro|duction
of &s;uch Perfection as this is de&s;igned, &s;hould in an in&s;tant be brought
to its compleat Ripene&s;s and Perfection; but as all the Works of Nature if
it be naturally proceeded with, it mu&s;t have its due time to acquire its due
form and full maturity, by gradual Growth and a natural Progre&s;&s;ion; not
but that the other method is al&s;o of excellent and nece&s;&s;ary use, and will very
often facilitate and ha&s;ten the progre&s;s to perfection. An In&s;tance of which
kind I de&s;igned &s;ome Years &s;ince to have given this Honourable Society in
&s;ome of my Lectures upon the motions and influences of the Caele&s;tial Bodies,
if it had been then thought fit; but I under&s;tand the fame thing will now be
&s;hortly done by Mr. <HI>Newton</HI> in a Treati&s;e of his now in the Pre&s;s: But that
will not be the only In&s;tance of that kind which I de&s;ign here to produce,
for that I have divers In&s;tances of the like Nature wherein from an <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>
being &s;uppo&s;ed or a premeditated De&s;ign, all the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Subject
will be <HI>a Priori</HI> foretold, and the Effects naturally follow as proceeding from
a Cau&s;e &s;o and &s;o qualified and limited. And in truth the <HI>Synthetick,</HI> way by
Experiments Ob&s;ervations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will be very &s;low if it be not often a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the
<HI>Analytick</HI> which proves of excellent u&s;e, even tho' it proceed by a fal&s;e po|&s;ition;
for that the di&s;covery of a <HI>Negative</HI> is one way of re&s;training and limi|ting
an <HI>Affirmative.</HI></P>
<P>But not to &s;pend more time at pre&s;ent upon the more particular explicati|ons
of The&s;e Methods, which would make of it &s;elf a very large Di&s;|cour&s;e,
I &s;hall proceed to the Subject which I began to di&s;cour&s;e upon the la&s;t
meeting, premi&s;ing only in general what I think nece&s;&s;ary thereunto, an Ex|plication
of what I under&s;tand by natural Knowledge, or the Knowledge of Nature.</P>
<P>By Knowledge then in the highe&s;t <HI>idea</HI> of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Knowledge is and $ow acquired.</NOTE> I under&s;tand a certainty of
information of the Mind and Under&s;tanding founded upon true and undeni|able

<P><PB N="331" REF="310">
True and undeniable Evidence is afforded whether immediately by <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> with|out

<P>I call that <HI>Sen&s;e</HI> without Fallacy, where the <HI>fallacies</HI> of Sen&s;e being detected
and known, the Evidence produced thereby is examined and found to be free
and clear of all &s;uch <HI>Fallacies.</HI></P>
<P>I call that true <HI>Ratiocination</HI> from &s;uch Sen&s;e, where being &s;ure of the Pre|mi&s;es,
the Conclu&s;ion nece&s;&s;arily follows from them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The true Me|thod of Rea|&s;oning.</NOTE> which is the method
of Rea&s;oning made u&s;e of it <HI>Geomotry,</HI> and by which we arrive at as great a cer|tainty

<P>Now tho' in Phy&s;ical Inquiries, by rea&s;on of the ab&s;tru&s;ene&s;s of Cau&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difficulty thereof in Natural Philo&s;ophy.</NOTE> and
the limited Power of the Sen&s;es we cannot thus rea&s;on, and without many
Inductions from a multitude of Particulars come to rai&s;e exact Definitions of
things and general Propo&s;itions; yet by comparing of varieties of &s;uch In|ductions
we may arrive to &s;o great an a&s;&s;urance and limitation of Propo&s;itions
as will at lea&s;t be &s;ufficient to ground Conjectures upon, which may &s;erve
for making <HI>Hypothe&s;es</HI> fit to be enquired into by the <HI>Analytick</HI> method, and
thence to find out what other Experiments or Ob&s;ervations are nece&s;&s;ary to
be procured for the further progre&s;s in the <HI>Synthetick,</HI> which will que&s;tion|le&s;s
&s;o far inform us of the general and univer&s;al progre&s;s of the Operations
of Nature, that nothing but what is really the truth &s;hall be propo&s;ed but
the ab&s;urdity and in&s;ufficiency thereof will pre&s;ently be detected and
proved.</P>
<P>So that tho' po&s;&s;ibly we may not be able to produce a <HI>Po&s;itive</HI> Proof, yet
we may attain to that of a <HI>Negative,</HI> which in many ca&s;es is as cogent and
undeniable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Negative many times as cogent as an Affirmative.</NOTE> and none but a willful or &s;en&s;ele&s;s Per&s;on will refu&s;e his a&s;&s;ent
unto it. Thus much I thought was nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e in order to what I
have further to propound to the Con&s;ideration of this noble Society upon the
Subject. I have di&s;cour&s;ed of formerly only by way of Queries; it being my
aim at pre&s;ent to &s;ee what <HI>Po&s;itive</HI> or <HI>Negative</HI> certainty at lea&s;t may be at|tained
concerning the &s;ame, either from the information of Sen&s;e freed from
Fallacies or from the &s;uper&s;tructures of Rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>I propounded then two Hypothe&s;es for the &s;olution of the <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> ob|&s;erv'd
in <HI>Petrified Bodies,</HI> of the re&s;emblance of Animal and Vegetable Bodies;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Petrified Sub&s;tances.</NOTE>
&s;ueh as the Shells and Bodies of Fi&s;hes, the Bones, Teeth, Hornes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of
Fi&s;h, and al&s;o of Terre&s;trial Animals, the Wood, Leaves, Bark, Roots, and
Fruits of Plants and Vegetables; which re&s;embling Bodies are found to be
of variety of Sub&s;tances,&s;ometimes of Stone, as Flint, Marble, Black,
White, Gray, and of various other Colours, of $ree-&s;tone, <HI>Portland-&s;tone,</HI>
Chalk, and an infinite variety of other Stone, &s;ome harder, &s;ome &s;ofter: Of
various kinds of Clay, Earth, Sand, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they have been found near the tops
of the highe&s;t Hills, and the bottom of the lowe&s;t Wells and Mines, in the
middle of the &s;olid Quarries of Stone and other Minerals, and tho&s;e the
mo&s;t remote, or at lea&s;t very far di&s;tant from the Sea. Some of the&s;e have
the perfect repre&s;entation of the Figure of &s;u$h Creatures and other Sub&s;tan|ces
as are now well known, others of &s;uch as have &s;ome analogy and likene&s;s
to them, yet different from what are known of tho&s;e Species to which they
&s;eem to belong, either in Magnitude, Figure, Colour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet retain &s;uch
characteri&s;tick marks as &s;eem to indicate them to belong to this or that Spe|cies
of Animals or Vegetables. Some of the&s;e are nothing but perfect Stones
of &s;everal kinds, others are inclo&s;ed with a Sub&s;tance &s;eeming to be the fame,
with that of the very Animal or Vegetable they re&s;emble. Add to this, that in
as many varieties of places there have been found others of the&s;e Figured Bo|dies,
<PB N="332" REF="311">
which have as to Sen&s;e the very &s;ame Sub&s;tance and Figures with tho&s;e
of the corre&s;ponding Species of Animals or Vegetables, and do not &s;eem to
be at all of a potrify'd and &s;tony Sub&s;tance, but rather of an Animal or Ve|getable;
of every of which Particulars I have viewd and examined In&s;tances.
And if it were not for detaining you too long, could have here produced a
more particular Account and De&s;cription. But they being &s;o generally known
at dea&s;t &s;o univer&s;ally almo&s;t &s;pread over the whole Earth, &s;o that no Coun|try
almo&s;t but doth afford them, I thought it would be needle&s;s.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion now is how we &s;hall come to a certainty of Knowledge con|cerning
them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to come to acertain know|ledge of them.</NOTE> by which we may be able to under&s;tand what they really are:
And Secondly, What are the Cause of them. Thirdly, How they came to be di&s;posed, placed, or made in tho&s;e parts where they are, or have been
found. Fourthly, The&s;e Discoveries being made to &s;atisfaction, of what u&s;e
or benefit will it be to Mankind, or how &s;hall we be the wi&s;er, or how will
this Knowledge be an improvement of Natural Knowledge? Which is the
aim of this Society.</P>
<P>For An&s;wer then to the&s;e &s;everal Queries I &s;hall propound the&s;e following
Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To know what Sub&s;tance they are of.</NOTE> As to the way of knowing of what Sub&s;tance they are, I conceive
there can be no better way than what we generally u&s;e when we inquire in|to
the true Nature or Sub&s;tance of any other Body when it is delivered to us
to be examined or denominated; for in&s;tance, if a peice of Metal be deliver|ed
to be examined, it will fir&s;t be viewed to &s;ee what Metal it re&s;embles in
Colour and Con&s;i&s;tence, or in &s;uch other obvious and &s;en&s;ible Qualifications
as may enable one to judge or gue&s;s what kind of Metal it is; as &s;uppo&s;e
it re&s;embles Gold for clo&s;ene&s;s and ponderou&s;ne&s;s, the&s;e give intimation e|nough
of examining it yet a little more curiou&s;ly, &s;ince all is not Gold that
gli&s;ters, and it may be that &s;ome Counterfeit in tho&s;e more obvious Quali|fications
has mimicked that noble Metal, to do this, it is tried further by be|ing
put into good <HI>Aqua Fortis,</HI> to &s;ee whether that will di&s;&s;olve it, for if
it doth, it cannot be Gold. Secondly, The Specifick Gravity thereof is
more curiou&s;ly and exactly found by the help of Scales and Weights, by
which it is weighed in and out of Water, becau&s;e if thereby it be found to
be lighter than Gold it cannot be Gold. Thirdly, By Hammering and a
Gold Beater, 'tis found to be Malleable, and by looking through the Leaf,
'tis found of a tran&s;parent Greene&s;s and reflects a true Golden Colour, then
'tis tried by copelling and found fixed in the Fire, then it tarni&s;hes not in the
Air, and Amalgams Readily with <HI>Mercury,</HI> then its Solution in AR tinges,
the Skin and Nails red, and a further trial &s;hews it to tinge Gla&s;s of a Ruby
Colour. Now if it bear all the&s;e &s;everal ways of Examination, and an&s;wers
to the properties of Gold, it may &s;afely be concluded to be true Gold, and
whoever &s;hall deny it to be &s;uch mu&s;t be looked upon as one that doth it
without Rea&s;on, unle&s;s he can produce a further Criterion by which it &s;hall
be found to be very differing from it. Now, tho' this Metal were found at
the bottom of a Mine a hundred Foot under Ground, or at the top of a Hill
a hundred Foot above the Level of the Plain; or in the Pores of a growing
Vegetable; or in the Tooth or Thigh of an Animal, tho' po&s;&s;ibly it may be
difficult to a&s;&s;ign the Rea&s;on or Cau&s;e how it came to be placed there; yet
the Examiner hath the Evidence of Sen&s;e to a&s;&s;ure him that this Metal is
Gold, and he ought to conclude and acquie&s;ce in it, that &s;uch it is; otherwi&s;e
there can be nothing at all known that it is this or that Body, and then
there is an end of all further Inquiry or Experiment.</P>
<P>Now though there may not be known &s;o many various ways of examining
every other kind of Body, as, by rea&s;on of the value of it, there have been
found out for Gold; yet in many Bodies at lea&s;t a much le&s;s number will &s;erve
the turn to give a&s;&s;urance, that the Body &s;o examined is of this on that kind
and in many the very outward form as vi&s;ible to the naked Eye, but e&s;pecial|ly
if the inward vi&s;ibie appearance of the Sub&s;tance be joined with it, will
<PB N="333" REF="312">
be a&s;&s;urance &s;ufficient to force an A&s;&s;ent or Conclu&s;ion of what kind the Body
is that is &s;o examined, and it ought not to be denied to be &s;uch without as
evident a manife&s;tation to the contrary.</P>
<P>This Di&s;cour&s;e I have been the larger in premi&s;ing, becau&s;e, till it be agreed
what is &s;ufficient evidence to prove a natural Body of this or that kind there
can be nothing done. If Experimental Philo&s;ophy, and if Poofs of this kind
will not &s;uffice, I cannot expect that all that I &s;hall bring to prove the <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI>
will be of any validity. That then which I &s;hall indeavour to prove is;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That there have been, and daily are found, the real Shells of Fi&s;hes
in &s;uch parts of the Earth as are much above the pre&s;ent Level of the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Recapitulati|on of the Heads mention'd Pag.</HI> 288. <HI>Supra.</HI></NOTE>
and others buried at a very great depth under the Surface of the Earth, where
notwith&s;tanding, 'tis evident that they were not there placed by any humane
Power or De&s;ign.</P>
<P>Secondly, That many of the&s;e Shells are of a form differing from any of
tho&s;e Shells of that Species to which they &s;eem to belong, which are common|ly
known at this Day.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That there are others of them which to all appearance are of the
very &s;ame Species now known and to be found living.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That there are many of the&s;e Shells which are and have been
in proce&s;s of time, fill'd within and inclo&s;ed without with divers &s;orts of
Earth, &s;uch as, Clay, Lome, Sea Sand, and divers other kinds of Sand,
Mud, Chalk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, That tho&s;e filling and enclo&s;ing Bodies have been, and are by de|grees,
in proce&s;s of time, petrify'd and hardn'd into Stones of differing Na|tures,
Hardne&s;s and Contextures retaining the Impre&s;&s;ion, Form, or Signa|ture
of tho&s;e Shells, &s;o inclo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Sixthly, That tho&s;e Shells &s;o filled and inclo&s;ed, as above &s;aid, are ac|cording
to the differing Nature of the Petrifactive Liquor or Juice: &s;ome|times
al&s;o Petrify'd retaining &s;till the &s;ame Figure they were of when the Pe|trifactive
Juice began to operate upon them.</P>
<P>Seventhly, That others of them remain yet perfect Shells without Petri|faction,
or Alteration, when as yet both the Sub&s;tance that fills them, and that
which enclo&s;es them is converted into Stone of differing Natures arid Tex|tures.</P>
<P>Eighthly, That many of the&s;e Shells are either by length of Time, or by
the Nature of the Petrifactive Juice perfectly rotted and decayed &s;o as to be
ea&s;ily frangible between one's Finger and Thumb into a very fine Powder and
yet &s;erve to give a perfect Mould or Shape to the inclo&s;ed and Inclo&s;ing-Stone.</P>
<P>Ninthly, That in many ca&s;es the Shell is not only Petrify'd by the &s;aid
Juice, but &s;ometimes after the impre&s;&s;ion hath been made as afore&s;aid, the
Shell hath been clearly di&s;&s;olved and carried away from the inclo&s;ing and in|clo&s;ed
Sub&s;tances, leaving only the Space empty where the &s;aid Shell hath
been placed.</P>
<P>Tenthly, That it &s;ometimes happens that the Sub&s;tance that filled the
Shell hath been Petrify'd, and after the Shell hath been rotted away, the Pe|trify'd
Body that Was inclo&s;ed and had received that Impre&s;&s;ion, hath been
afterwards inclo&s;ed with a Sub&s;tance which hath afterwards Petrify'd and &s;o
inclo&s;ed it in Stone.</P>
<P>Eleventhly, That the&s;e kinds of Shells or the Petrify'd Sub&s;tances that
have been formed by them, have been for all Antiquity, and are at this Day
to be found in mo&s;t parts of the known World.</P>
<P>Twelvethly, That they are mo&s;t of them differing from one another, tho'
all referable to &s;ame Species of Shell-Fi&s;hes now to be found; yet in many
particulars each of them al&s;o differing from them; that is, tho&s;e that are
found in one Country or Region, are very differing from tho&s;e of another
Country or Region, and that not only as to the Nature of the Petrify'd Sub|&s;tance
inclo&s;ed and inclo&s;ing, but al&s;o as to the Figure and Make of the
Shells them&s;elves; and many of tho&s;e al&s;o differing from the &s;hape even of
<PB N="334" REF="313" MS="Y">
tho&s;e Shell-Fi&s;hes which are now to be found in &s;uch parts of the Seas which
are &s;ituated near to the places that they are found in.</P>
<P>Concurring to this Head I &s;hall prove that Shell-F&s;ihes of the &s;ame Species
in differing Countries now to be found, have many differences one from an|other,
as much as any one of tho&s;e Petrify'd Bodies have from any of the pre|&s;ent Shells.</P>
<P>I have in my former Di&s;cour&s;es explain'd the end and aim of the&s;e my Inqui|&s;itions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The end of the Author's Di&s;|cour&s;es.</NOTE>
namely, to make &s;ome U&s;e and Application of &s;everal Ob&s;ervations
and Experiments that have been Collected in order to deduce &s;ome Doctrine
from them, which may &s;erve to direct, &s;uch further Inqui&s;itions as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary
for the perfecting, of the &s;ame, or at lea&s;t to find whether &s;uch are
wanting, and of what Kind and Nature they are.</P>
<P>The Doctrine aimed at, is, the Cau&s;e and Rea&s;on of the pre&s;ent Figure,
Shape and Con&s;titution of the Surface of this Body of the Earth, whether
Sea or Land, as we now find it pre&s;ented unto us under various and very ir|regular

of Authorities fetched out of printed Authors, and as many others
that I have received from the Relations of very credible Per&s;ons that have
found them them&s;elves, but it would be too long, I &s;hall therefore only name
one who was formerly a worthy Member of this Society, and well known to
divers here pre&s;ent, and that was Dr. <HI>Peter Ball,</HI> he pa&s;&s;ing, over the <HI>Alps</HI> to
go into <HI>Italy</HI> by a narrow Pa&s;&s;age, where there was on the one hand a prodi|gious
high Cli&s;f above him, and on the other hand, as prodigious deep Preci|pice
below him, ob&s;erved in the Cliff a Layer of Sea Sand and Shells for a
very great length buried under that high Mountain above: he had the curi|o&s;ity
to take up and bring home with him into <HI>England</HI> divers of them which
$$e dug out of the &s;aid Layer of Sand which he &s;hewed me, and I found them
to be true Oy&s;ter-&s;hells, not Petrified but remaining perfect Shells, one of
which he gave me, and had divers others which he kept; he ob&s;erved al&s;o, that
there were divers other Sub&s;tances among the Sand as if it had been upon the
Sea-&s;hoar. To this I &s;hall add an Ob&s;ervation of my own nearer Home,
which others po&s;&s;ibly may have the opportunity of &s;eeing, and that was at
the We&s;t end of the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> in a Cliff lying within the <HI>Needles</HI> almo&s;t
oppo&s;ite to <HI>Hur&s;t-Ca&s;tle,</HI> it is an Earthy &s;ort of Cliff made up of &s;everal &s;orts
of Layers, of Clays, Sands, Gravels and Loames one upon the other. Some|what
above the middle of this Cliff, which I judge in &s;ome parts may be a|bout
two Foot high, I found one of the &s;aid Layers to be of a perfect Sea Sand
filled with a great variety of Shells, &s;uch as Oy&s;ters, Limpits, and &s;e|veral
&s;orts of Periwinkles, of which kind I dug out many and brought them
with me, and found them to be of the &s;ame kind with tho&s;e which were ve|ry
plentifully to be found upon the Shore beneath, now ca&s;t out of the Sea.
<PB N="335" REF="314" MS="Y">
This Layer is extended along this Cliff I conceive near half a Mile, and may
be about &s;ixty Foot or more above the high Water mark.</P>
<P>Another In&s;tance I ob&s;erved nearer this place, and that was in St. <HI>James</HI>'s
Fields, where St. <HI>James</HI>'s Square is now built, in which place when they were
making Bricks of the Brick Earth there dug, they had &s;unk &s;everal Wells,
which I judge might be near twenty Foot in depth, to procure Water for
that purpo&s;e; going down into &s;everal of tho&s;e, I found, at the bottom, a
Layer of perfect Sea Sand, with variety of Shells, and &s;everal Bones, and o|ther
Sun&s;tances, of which kind I dug out enough to fiil a &s;mall Box and &s;hew|ed
them to Mr. <HI>Boyl,</HI> and al&s;o to this <HI>Society.</HI> And I was informed al&s;o, that
the &s;ame kind of Sub&s;tances were found in digging of a Snow Well in St.
<HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Park;</HI> and I doubt not but whoever &s;hall &s;ink any where thereabout
to that depth will find the &s;ame things. Now whoever will con&s;ider the Po&s;i|tions
and Circum&s;tances of the &s;aid places, will ea&s;ily grant, I &s;uppo&s;e, that
they could not be there placed by the Indu&s;try of <HI>Man,</HI> but mu&s;t be a&s;cribed
to &s;ome other cau&s;e to be fetched from <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>As to the &s;econd Head, That, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I &s;hall produce &s;everal Oy&s;ter and Cockle<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See</HI> p. 333.</NOTE>
Shells which have been and are to be found in many Parts of <HI>England,</HI> which
in many particulars of their &s;hape, do differ from tho&s;e of the Oy&s;ters and
Cockles now to be found; yet upon examination of them they may be found
to be true and perfect Shells by all &s;en&s;ible Qualities, except only their exact
&s;hape, and therefore I conceive that to be &s;ufficient Evidence to prove them
to be really &s;uch, becau&s;e it is all the Evidence the Matter is capable of. If
in digging a Mine, or the like, an artificial Coin or Urne, or the like Sub|&s;tance
be found, no one &s;cruples to affirm it to be of this or that Metal or
Earth he finds them by trial to be of: Nor that they are <HI>Roman, Suxon, Norman,</HI>
or the like, according to the Relievo, impre&s;&s;ion, Characters, or Form
they find them of. Now the&s;e Shells and other Bodies are the Medals, Urnes,
or Monuments of Nature, who&s;e Relievoes, Impre&s;&s;ions, Characters, Forms,
Sub&s;tances, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are much more plain and di&s;coverable to any unbia&s;&s;ed Per|&s;on,
and therefore he has no rea&s;on to &s;cruple his a&s;&s;ent: nor to de&s;i&s;t from
making his Ob&s;ervations to correct his natural Chronology, and to conjecture
how, and when, and upon what occa&s;ion they came to be placed in tho&s;e Re|po&s;itories.
The&s;e are the greate&s;t and mo&s;t la&s;ting Monuments of Antiqui|ty,
which, in all probability, will far antidate all the mo&s;t ancient Monu|ments
of the World, even the very Pyramids, Obelisks, Mummys, Hiero|glyphicks,
and Coins, and will afford more information in Natural Hi&s;tory,
than tho&s;e other put altogether will in Civil. Nor will there be wanting <HI>Me|dia</HI>
or <HI>Criteria,</HI> of Chronology, which may give us &s;ome account even of the
time when, as I &s;hall afterwards mention.</P>
<P>As to the Proof of the third Propo&s;ition, <HI>viz.</HI> That, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> All tho&s;e In&s;tan|ces
I have named are of &s;ufficient evidence, for that tho&s;e which I found in
both tho&s;e places I mentioned were of the &s;ame kinds with tho&s;e that are now
to be found near tho&s;e places, as whoever &s;hall examine will find.</P>
<P>And the fourth will al&s;o from the &s;ame, and hundreds of others be as evi|dent,
and therefore I &s;uppo&s;e none will &s;cruple to a&s;&s;ent to this Propo&s;ition,
<HI>viz.</HI> That, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Page 333, e&s;pecially if the truth of the former be gran|ted,
which I conceive cannot be denied.</P>
<P>For Proof of the fifth Propo&s;ition namely, That, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The place I mentioned
before near the <HI>Needles</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight</HI> afforded a mo&s;t evident
and convincing one as could well be de&s;ired, which was from the following
Observation. I took notice that the afore&s;aid Earthy Cliff did founder down
and fall upon the Sea-&s;hoar underneath, which was &s;mooth and Sandy, and
bare at low Water &s;o as to be walked on, but at high Water a great part of
it was covered by the Sea. I ob&s;erved &s;everal great lumps of the &s;aid Founder|ings
lying below, &s;ome whereof, which lay next the Cliff, tho' they were &s;ome|what
harden'd together more than they were above in the Cliff, were yet not
<PB N="336" REF="315">
hard enough to be accounted Stone; others of them that lay further into
the Sea were yet more hard, and &s;ome of the furthe&s;t I could not come at
for the Water, were as hard I conceived as <HI>Purbeck</HI> Paving (which is taken
up from the Shore of <HI>Purbeck,</HI> lying ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to it on the We&s;t &s;ide of
this Channel or Pa&s;&s;age) divers of the&s;e Stones I ob&s;erv'd to be made up of the
pieces of Earth that had foundred down from the Cliff, which I was a&s;&s;ured
of by carefully ob&s;erving and finding divers of them to con&s;i&s;t of the &s;everal
Layers, and in the &s;ame order as I &s;aw them in the Cliff; among the re&s;t I
found divers that had the Layer of Sea Sand and Shells which I had ob&s;erved
in the Cliff in&s;erted in the Stone with the adjoyning Layers all petrify'd to|gether
into a hard Stone. Here I found multitudes of the &s;aid Shells I before
mention'd to have ob&s;erv'd in the Cliff, mix'd loo&s;ely with a Sea Sand; now
together with the &s;aid Sand both fill'd, inclos'd, and petrify'd altogether,
and I broke off many peices of the &s;aid Rocks, where I found the &s;aid Petri|factions,
and found them much like other Stones I had &s;een from other Inland
Quarries here of <HI>England,</HI> wherein I had ob&s;erv'd al&s;o &s;uch kind of petrify'd
Shells, tho' how they came there to be &s;o Petrify'd I could not be &s;o well in|formed.
For that which I conceive was the cau&s;e of this &s;uddain Petrifaction
(for I conceive tho&s;e that I examin'd had not been Stones for very many Years,
which I judged by their di&s;tance from the pre&s;ent Cliff, and from the quanti|ty
thereof, which <HI>Communibus Annis</HI> did founder down) was that clo&s;e by this
Cliff, there is a vitriolate or aluminous Spring or Rill which runs into the
Sea, where formerly tho&s;e Salts have been made of it by boyling, but has
been now omitted for many Years. The&s;e &s;aline Springs or Rills I conjecture
mixing with the Sea-Water, may be the cau&s;e of the &s;aid Petrifaction, and
the want of it is the cau&s;e why other founderings in other parts of the &s;aid
Cliff are not at all &s;o Petrify'd. Now from the a&s;&s;ur'd Ob&s;ervation of the&s;e
Petrifactions, I cannot but judge that the truth of this Propo&s;ition will mo&s;t
evidently appear, and needs no other to confirm it. However I doubt not
but that any one who &s;hould there lay a part of the &s;aid Ciiff &s;haped and mark|ed
as he pleas'd for his own a&s;&s;urance, would find the &s;ame very hard Petri|fy'd
in two or three Years, which may not be unworthy of farther Inquiry and
Trial for &s;uch as have opportunity.</P>
<P>As to the Proof of the &s;ixth Propo&s;ition, it will not be difficult, the pre|ceding
being once granted for that there may be thou&s;ands of In&s;tances of that
Nature found in the Stones dug out of divers of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Quarries; &s;ome
of which Stones are found full of &s;uch Petrifactions.</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion I think it not improper to mention an Ob&s;ervation
which I have often taken notice of, which is of the Flints which are general|ly
found intermix'd with Chalk in Quarries of that kind of Stone. I have
ob&s;erv'd then that the&s;e Flints are nothing el&s;e but the Body of the Chalk u|nited
together, and, as it were, fir&s;t diluted by a petrifick Juice, and by that
di&s;&s;olved into it, and &s;o make a uniform clo&s;e Body which by degrees doth all
petrify and harden together into that &s;olid hard Body of the Flint. This I
found by taking notice of the Nature of tho&s;e Flints when broken, and how
the Grain, Colour and Hardne&s;s of them was &s;ituated e&s;pecially towards the
edges; for there where the Juice &s;eem'd to be almo&s;t &s;pent, the Flinty Body
appears of a midling Nature between Chalk and Flint, be&s;ides I have ob|&s;erv'd
&s;ometimes other Bodies inclo&s;ed, and &s;ometimes lumps of Chalk al&s;o,
toward which the Limb-parts of the Flint were coloured and terminated ju&s;t
as towards the incompa&s;&s;ing Chalk. And from the curious and &s;harp run|ning
and mouldings which I have ob&s;erved in Flints, I conceive that the fir&s;t
Liquid Sub&s;tance of it was altogether as fluid as Water, tho' it were imbu'd
with a Saline Sulphureous or other petrifactive Tincture. The&s;e Indications
may be much more plainly manife&s;ted by &s;uch a peice of Flint than 'tis po&s;|&s;ible
for any one to de&s;cribe by words; and therefore I &s;hall omit the farther
mention of them till I can meet with a Flint to &s;hew them. I mention this
here only to &s;hew that the petrifactive Juice is often found to in&s;inuate it&s;eif
into the clo&s;e&s;t Pores of Body, by reafon of its great fluidity which inables it
oft to petrify even the very Bodies and Substances of the Shells them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="316" MS="Y">
But tho' &s;ome of the&s;e Petrifactive Liquors be thus fluid, yet they are not
all; and thence it comes that many Shells remain unpetrify'd, tho' the Sub|&s;tances
that fill'd them and enclos'd them be &s;o wrote upon, which was the
&s;eventh Propo&s;ition I undertook to prove. This I can make evident by di|vers
of the Petrifactions that are kept in this Repo&s;itory, and by thou&s;ands
of others which I have &s;een: And any one that will but diligently examine
them will find the very Shells them&s;elves pre&s;erved Shells, tho' inclo&s;ed in
the middle of a Stone, as of <HI>Portland, Purbeck,</HI> and divers other Inland Stones
here dug in <HI>England.</HI> And I am promi&s;ed to have &s;ent me a flake of a Stone
which is very hard, which notwith&s;tanding is all over full of Shells. I &s;ay
Shells, for that I cannot call them any thing el&s;e; &s;ince to all &s;en&s;ible trials
they are &s;o, both as to Figure and Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>As to the Proof of the Eighth, I cannot produce a more pregnant one than
the <HI>Echinus</HI> or Helmet-Stone, found by Mr. <HI>William Ball</HI> upon the Shore of
<HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> near <HI>Exeter,</HI> which he pre&s;ented to the Society, and I &s;uppo&s;e
may yet be &s;een in the Repo&s;itory, for by that alone it will plainly appear,
that there had been formerly a Shell that had cau&s;ed both the formations of
the containing and contained Flint, there being ju&s;t the due thickne&s;s of &s;uch
a Shell vacant between them, but there may be hundreds of others produced
of the like kinds if it were needful.</P>
<P>A Proof of the Ninth and Tenth, <HI>viz.</HI> I think the large <HI>Cornu Ammonis</HI>
may afford; for here it &s;eems plain, that a great part of the Shell was wa&s;ted
away before the perfect Petrifaction of both the inclo&s;ing and inclo&s;ed Stone,
tho' part of the Shell be yet remaining &s;ticking between them.</P>
<P>'Tis a hard matter to make a po&s;itive Proof of the Eleventh, <HI>viz.</HI> Becau&s;e
of the infinity of them that would be nece&s;&s;ary, yet I think it would not be
difficult to bring credible Te&s;timonies enough to &s;upply one for each Country,
and that I &s;uppo&s;e may &s;uffice to make it probable that they may be found in
all others, &s;ince, as I &s;hall afterwards prove, they have been produced all by
the &s;ame cau&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the Twelfth Propo&s;ition which I undertook to prove, <HI>viz.</HI> That
mo&s;t of tho&s;e Shells or other Sub&s;tances found as above, whether Petrify'd or
not Petrify'd, are in the fir&s;t place differing from one another in many par|ticulars
both of Figure and Sub&s;tance, tho' yet they retain &s;uch particular
Characteristicks as are &s;ufficient to denote and &s;how to what Species they be|long,
either of Vegetables or Animals, whether of Fi&s;hes or terre&s;trial Crea|tures,
&s;uch as are now to be met with alive; that is, not only that &s;uch as
are thus found in one Country, are differing from tho&s;e which are found in
another: And in Petrify'd ones this is not only remarkable in the Sub&s;tance
inclo&s;ing and inclo&s;ed, but al&s;o in the magnitude, Figure and Make of the things
them&s;elves; and in the &s;econd place many of them do con&s;iderably differ from
the &s;hape of tho&s;e Shell-Fi&s;hes, and other Sub&s;tances which are now to be
found alive in &s;uch parts of the Seas as are neare&s;t &s;ituated to the places where
the&s;e Fo&s;&s;il or Land Shells are now to be found. For the proof of which I
have no better means than to have recour&s;e to the Sub&s;tances them&s;elves,
which have been &s;o found, of which there is an excellent Collection in the
Repo&s;itory of this Society, though I have al&s;o &s;een divers other in&s;tanccs in
other Collections and Ob&s;ervations which I have el&s;ewhere met with, which I
cannot now produce. Yet one In&s;tance for all I &s;uppo&s;e may be this great
Voluta which I have here produced, that was taken out of a Quarry in <HI>Port|land</HI>
(and I believe that tho&s;e two other great ones in the Repo&s;itory which I
begg'd of the late Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> for the Repo&s;itory are of the &s;ame kind
and from the &s;ame place) for by the&s;e I think it plainly enough appears, that
they are very differing from all the other Sub&s;tances or particular Petrifactions
that are in the Repo&s;itory, both in Magnitude, Colour, Shape and Sub&s;tance
including and included, and even in the very Sub&s;tance of that which I call,
and &s;hall prove the Shell; and not only do they thus differ from the Petri|factions
<PB N="338" REF="317">
Fo&s;&s;ile or Land found Shells, but they differ al&s;o from all the known
&s;orts of Shells of that Species of Fi&s;hes, to which I would refer them, which are
now to be found any where near that place alive, nay, in any part of the
World that I yet knew of; notwith&s;tanding all which, they do retain, I con|ceive
certain Characteri&s;ticks of their Form, which &s;how them to have be|long'd
to that Species of Shell-Fi&s;hes which are call'd <HI>Nautili.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Nau|tili</HI>
are de&s;crib'd by <HI>Ge&s;ner, Aldrovand, John&s;ton,</HI> and others, where you have
their Names and a Picture or two of the Shells, and &s;ome Stones al&s;o tend|ing
to a De&s;cription of the Creature and two Species of them; but he that
&s;hall think to find any &s;uch Characteri&s;ticks by reading their De&s;criptions and
&s;eeing their Pictures of them, will be much mi&s;taken. And indeed it is not
only in the description of this Species of Shells and Fi&s;hes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Defect of Natural Hi&s;to|ry.</NOTE> that a very great
Defect or Imperfection may be found among Natural Hi&s;torians, but in
the De&s;cription of mo&s;t other things; &s;o that without in&s;pection of the things
them&s;elves, a Man is but a very little wi&s;er or more in&s;tructed by the Hi&s;tory,
Picture, and Relations concerning Natural Bodys; for the Ob&s;ervations
for the mo&s;t part are &s;o &s;uperficial, and the De&s;criptions &s;o ambiguous, that
they create a very imperfect Idea of the true Nature and Characteri&s;tick of
the thing de&s;cribed, and &s;uch as will be but of very little u&s;e without an o|cular
In&s;pection and a manual handling, and other &s;en&s;ible examinations of the
very things them&s;elves; for the&s;e are &s;o many con&s;iderable In&s;tances that
may by that means be taken notice of, which may be u&s;eful to this or that
purpo&s;e for which they may be in&s;tructive, that 'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for any
one Examiner or De&s;criber to take notice of them, or &s;o much as to have any
imagination of them. It were therefore much to be wi&s;hht for and indea|voured
that there might be made and kept in &s;ame Repo&s;itory as full and
compleat a Collection of all varieties of Natural Bodies as could be obtain'd,
where an Inquirer might be able to have recour&s;e, where he might perufe,
and turn over, and &s;pell, and read the Book ot Nature, and ob&s;erve the <HI>Or|thography
Etymologia, Syntaxis,</HI> and <HI>Pro&s;odia</HI> of Natures Grammar, and by
which, as with a <HI>Dictionary,</HI> he might readily turn to and find the true Figure,
Cmpo&s;ition, Derivation and U&s;e of the Characters, Words, Phra&s;es and
Sentences of Nature written with indelible, and mo&s;t exact, and mo&s;t expre&s;|&s;ive
Letters, without which Books it will be very difficult to be thoroughly a
<HI>Literatus</HI> in the Language and Sen&s;e of Nature. The u&s;e of &s;uch a Collecti|on
is not for Diverti&s;ement, and Wonder, and Gazing, as 'tis for the mo&s;t part
thought and e&s;teemed, and like Pictures for Children to admire and be plea&s;ed
with, but for the mo&s;t &s;erious and diligent &s;tudy of the mo&s;t able Proficient
in Natural Philo&s;ophy. And upon this occa&s;ion tho' it be a digre&s;&s;ion, I could
heartily with that a Collection were made in this Repo&s;itory of as many va|rieties
as could be procured of the&s;e kinds of Fo&s;&s;ile-Shells and Petrifactions,
which would be no very difficult matter to be done if any one made it his care:
For <HI>England</HI> alone would afford &s;ome hundreds of varieties &s;ome Petrify'd,
&s;ome not. There are few Quarries of Stone here in <HI>England</HI> I believe, but if
they were look'd into &s;ome kind or other of the&s;e Petrifactions might be found
in them: I have ob&s;erv'd them in Marbles almo&s;t of all varieties of Colours, as
Black, White, Red, and otherwi&s;e Speckled: I have &s;een them in great va|rieties
of Flints and Pebbles, in various &s;orts of hard Stones, as <HI>Purbeck, Port|land, York&s;hire, Kenti&s;h, Northampton&s;hire,</HI> &amp;c. I have &s;een many of them of
Copero&s;e or Vitriol Stone, or <HI>Pyrites,</HI> and <HI>John Bauhine,</HI> and others have de|&s;cribed
many of them of that Nature. Others of the&s;e are, found above
Ground, and others al&s;o under Ground very deep&punc; &s;ometimes unpetrify'd and
remaining perfect Shells, Bones, Woods, Roots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and have been found
by &s;everal &s;orts of trails to be truly &s;o, not only in External Figure, but al&s;o
in the Internal and Sub&s;tantial Parts of them; &s;o that in truth there is no
manner of Rea&s;on to doubt them to be tho&s;e very Substances they &s;o per|fectly
and fully re&s;mble.</P>
<P>But if yet there should be &s;ome one that &s;hould make a doubt, of their iden|tity
of &s;amene&s;s with &s;uch Sub&s;taces; as they &s;eem to re&s;emble I would wil|lingly
know what kind of Proof will &s;atisfie &s;uch his doubt, and by what Indi|cations
or Characteri&s;ticks he will know a Shell of an unknown Species ($or
<PB N="339" REF="318">
&s;uch may be &s;hewn him) when it shall be pre&s;ented to him, or a piece of
Wood of &s;ome &s;trange Tree brought from an unknown place; if he will &s;ay
by the relation of the bringer, that I conceive is not becoming a good Na|turali&s;t;
and &s;o one might have been impos'd on by the Relation of the in|combu&s;tible
Linnen which was here examin'd; but if he will &s;ay by its Pro|perties,
which he finds the &s;ame with that of shells, or Vegetables, or other
re&s;embling Sub&s;tances, then I an&s;wer, that the &s;ame will in the&s;e be mani|fe&s;tly &s;hewn. Now, the more of the&s;e certain Characteri&s;ticks of the &s;everal
Species of Bodies there are known, the greater certainties and a&s;&s;urances will
be afforded by the artificial and &s;trict Examination of them. As for in&s;tance,
the knowing the Exi&s;tance and Form of the micro&s;copical Pores of Wood, is
a better Characteri&s;tick to know that a Sub&s;tance is Wood than the outward
Figure and Appearance thereof, which may be artificially or accidentally imi|tated,
by which means I found that a peice ot Lignum Fo&s;&s;ile &s;ent from <HI>Ita|ly</HI>
by Cavalier <HI>Pozzo</HI> to Sir <HI>George Eut.</HI> and by him &s;uppo&s;ed to be only Earth
&s;haped into that form and not to be real Wood, as <HI>Stelluti</HI> al&s;o indeavours to
prove. By the examination, I &s;ay, and di&s;covery of the micro&s;copical Pores
thereof with a Magnifying-Gla&s;s to be like tho&s;e of Firr, I produced a better
Argument that it was really Firr than any <HI>Franci&s;eo Stelluti</HI> has argued to
prove it Earth. Another was, that it burnt as Wood, and made Coles like
tho&s;e of Wood, with micro&s;copical Pores; had I had enough of it I could
have examin'd it by Di&s;tillation, and various other Chymical Probations; for
the more of Te&s;ti'monies and Confe&s;&s;ions are fetch'd from the&s;e. Examinations
and Wracking, the greater will be the Evidence of the true Nature of tho&s;e
Sub&s;tances &s;o examin'd, tho' oftimes the Evidence afforded by &s;ome one,
may be &s;ufficient clearne&s;s to &s;ave all further Enquiries: &s;uch as the&s;e the
Lord <HI>Verulam</HI> call'd <HI>Experimenta Crucis,</HI> which &s;erve to direct the Inquierer
to proceed the right way in making his Judgment. The&s;e are &s;uch marks as I
call Chara&s;teri&s;ticks, which expre&s;ly determine, and limit the Nature and Spe|cies
of the Body under Con&s;ideration. For In&s;tance, I conceive that all tho&s;e
Petrify'd Sub&s;tances which are call'd Snake-&s;tones in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> from &s;ome re|&s;emblance
imagin'd of a Snake coyled up; and in Latin (<HI>Cornu Ammonis,</HI> or
Sand Horns po&s;&s;ibly from their being found in tho&s;e Sandy De&s;erts.</P>
<P>The&s;e Petrifactions, I &s;ay, I conceive to be nothing el&s;e but the Petrifactions
of &s;everal &s;orts of Sub&s;tances that the Shells of &s;ome &s;orts of <HI>Nantili</HI> happened
to be mix$d with, whil&s;t tho&s;e Sub&s;tances were yet very &s;oft and Liquid,
and before they came to be hardned into Stone by the Petrifactive Agent.
This Conception I grounded upon the&s;e Character&s;ticks, which in examining
a great many of them I have found. Fir&s;t, That in very many of them I have
manife&s;tly &s;een the the real moulding Shell there pre&s;eved, together with
the moulded Sub&s;tance.</P>
<P>Next I conceive, that this Shell did belong to the Species of the <HI>Nautili,</HI> or
&s;ailing Fi&s;h, from the&s;e Characteri&s;ticks. Fir&s;t, That the Shell is of a true Co|nical
Figure from the <HI>Ba&s;e</HI> to the <HI>Apex.</HI> Secondly, That this Cone is turned
into a <HI>Voluta</HI> or Spiral Cone, &s;o that the <HI>Azis</HI> thereof doth perfectly lye in
the &s;ame Plaine. Thirdly, That this Spiral being a true proportional Spi|ral,
is continually at certain di&s;tances intercepted by Diaphragmes; &s;o chat
tho&s;e Diaphragmes being taken as Ba&s;es of &s;everai Cones, the Cones &s;hall be
found to diminish in a &s;eries Geometrically Proportional. Fourthly, That
every one of the&s;e Diaphragmes is perforated with a hole &s;imilar and pro|portional
al&s;o according to a Geometical Series.</P>
<P>To the&s;e I might add other accidental Proprieties of the flating, crenating,
depre&s;&s;ing, ridging, &s;tringing, and the like, ornamenting, as it were, of the
outward &s;ides of this voluted conical Body, and the undulation and &s;oliation,
as I may call it, of the Diaphnagme, and the Fringing and Ruffling thereof;
all which are found of great variety in this or that Subalternate Species, as is
al&s;o the Section of the Ba&s;e, or that of the Diaphragme; but the&s;e are not to
be looked upon as Characteri&s;ticks or Differences to denominate a new
Species.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="319">
And here by the bye I cannot but take notice of the imperfect and inaccu|rate
De&s;cription of this &s;o curious a Fi&s;h as the <HI>Nautilus</HI> mu&s;t needs be, if one
May gue&s;s at the curio&s;ity thereof from tho&s;e de&s;criptions, which I find in
<HI>John&s;ton</HI> out of <HI>Ari&s;totle, Pliny, Bellonius, Pi&s;o, Cardan, Fauconerius,</HI> and others,
and from the curious make of the Shell, for by all tho&s;e de&s;criptions I cannot
imagine any one can get any tolerable Idea or Notion, what the make of &s;o
wonderful a Fi&s;h mu&s;t be that has &s;uch an admirable quality as to buoy him|&s;elf
as <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;ays, <HI>ex alto mari</HI> from the bottom of the Sea, and make him&s;elf
to &s;wim and &s;ail upon the top of the Water, and at plea&s;ure, or for fear pre|&s;ently
to &s;ink him&s;elf down again to the bottom. This will appear &s;o much
the more wonderful to one that &s;hall con&s;ider the great pre&s;&s;ure of the Wa|ter
at the bottom of the Sea, and in how differing a &s;tate of compre&s;&s;ion this
Animal mu&s;t be at tho&s;e two places, and by what power it becometh able to
make it&s;elf &s;o light at the bottom to ri&s;e and &s;eem half out of the Water,
and yet pre&s;ently &s;o heavy as to &s;ink down to the bottom, and this without
Finns or Tail to move it&s;elf. Now as this Property is peculiar to this Fi&s;h
only, &s;o is the make of the Shell differing from all the Species of Nature be|&s;ides,
and as I conceive is the Engine by which he performeth this admirable
Exploit; for the whole Shell is divided into a multitude of Cells or Cabins
&s;eparated and di&s;tingui&s;hed one from another by &s;everal Diaphragmes or Par|titions,
without any other perforation, &s;ave one &s;mall one, through which
pa&s;&s;eth a &s;mall Pipe, which I take to be the Gut of the Animal; this Gut
doth not fill a two hundred part of the Cavity through which it pa&s;&s;eth, and
the remaining part mu&s;t either be filled with Air or Water. Now if it be
filled with Water, as probably 'tis, when he &s;inketh him&s;elf to the bottom,
'tis prety hard to conceive how he filleth it with Air under &s;o great a pre&s;&s;ure
and at &s;uch a di&s;tance from it as to buoy him&s;elf up, unle&s;s it be caus'd with
&s;uch a fermentation of the Excrements of the Gut, or other Juices of the Bo|dy
as doth produce an artificial Air, which &s;erves for that purpo&s;e; which
&s;eems to me to be the true Cau&s;e, e&s;pecially &s;ince I find <HI>Gulielmus Pi&s;o</HI> to
add this Remark to his Hi&s;tory and De&s;cription of it. <HI>Cum damno meo Plinii
Di&s;criptionem veri&s;&s;imam e&s;&s;e compertus &s;um namdum talem pi&s;ciculum</HI> (&s;peaking

deniq &amp; ip&s;am tandem mortem incurrant. By which it plainly appears, that
the Juices or Excrements of this Fi&s;h are of a &s;trange fermenting or burning
Nature which may be the cau&s;e of &s;o &s;ingular and wonderful an Indowment,
which whether it be &s;o or not, I could heartily wi&s;h that &s;ome Per&s;on curious
in Anatony that has the opportunity of meeting with them alive would give
us a more accurate De&s;cription of its external and internal Formations and
Qualifications.</P>
<P>But to leave this Digre&s;&s;ion, which I have the longer in&s;i&s;ted upon to &s;hew
the great imperfections of the De&s;criptions of the Species of Nature and their
Qualifications and of the varieties of them (for that I have &s;een two Species
of this &s;ort not de&s;cribed or mentioned in any Author) and of how great u&s;e
a good Collection, and De&s;cription of them would be, as particularly concern|ing
this very Fi&s;h &s;hall have occa&s;ion &s;hortly to mention. To leave, I &s;ay,
this Digre&s;&s;ion, we may from this perceive how $little able we are from the
want of this Knowledge and Collection, to conclude, that becau&s;e we do not
already know a Fi&s;h or Shell exactly of the &s;hape of this or that <HI>Cornu Ammonus,</HI>
therefore that it could never have been any &s;uch Shell, &s;ince it then cannot
pre&s;ently be proved that there is at pre&s;ent, or ever was any &s;uch Fi&s;h in be|ing,
which &s;ome po&s;&s;ibly too confident of their Omni&s;ciency may Object, be|cau&s;e
they know none &s;uch them&s;elves, or have read of them; and therefore
that there is more rea&s;on that &s;uch Arguments as are drawn from the examina|tions
<PB N="341" REF="320" MS="Y">
of the Sub&s;tances, and the Characteri&s;ticks of the Form &s;hould be of
&s;ufficient evidence to evince that the&s;e Bodies that have the&s;e Qualifications
could not be formed but for &s;uch purposes, as tho&s;e Animals which we are
informed of, we know have all parts fitted for each &s;ingular and &s;urprizing u&s;e
de&s;igned; for it is certain that Nature doth nothing <HI>fru&s;tra,</HI> but manife&s;tly
with an admirable and wi&s;e de&s;ign, the truth of which Maxim will more and
more evidently appear, the more the Works thereof are curiously examined
and &s;earched into; and no unprejudiced per&s;on that thoroughly examins them
can fail of being convinc'd of the Truth and Certainty thereof, there being
&s;uch a Harmony, Con&s;ent and Uniformity, as I may &s;o &s;peak, in all its O|perations,
and a gradual tran&s;ition from one to another, that it is evident
that all the&s;e kinds of Petrifactions have been moulded by &s;ome Animal or Ve|getable
Sub&s;tance, as by Shells, Bones, Teeth, Fruits, Woods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
that many of them are the Sub&s;tances them&s;elves, yet unaltered.</P>
<P>Now this being proved or granted, which I conceive the in&s;pection and
examination of the things them&s;elves will mo&s;t powerfully effect; it mu&s;t
follow as a Con&s;equence of that Phaenomenon, that all parts almo&s;t of the
pre&s;ent Earth extant and appearing above the Sea, have been for &s;ome con|&s;iderable
time under it, and covered therewith. Since I conceive there is
&s;carce any Country in the World where the&s;e Monuments of Antiquity, the&s;e
Medals of Nature, or the&s;e Sea Marks and Evidences are not to be found
either above, or at &s;ome depth under Ground, and &s;ome not very deep;
particular Te&s;timonies of which Truth I have collected many out of the few
Natural Hi&s;torians I have had the opportunity to peru&s;e &s;ince I have had this
Notion; and I doubt not but that abundantly more may be collected even
out of Books. But inqui&s;itive Natuarli&s;ts, if it were made an Head of In|quiry,
would que&s;tionle&s;s meet with multitudes of other. In&s;tances almo&s;t e|very
where not as yet handed by any Hi&s;torian, of which truth I have been
a&s;&s;ur'd by many Te&s;timonies from other Per&s;ons; but of this I have &s;poken
already &s;ufficiently.</P>
<P>From the comparing of which Evidences with &s;everal other pertinent Cir|cum&s;tances
that may be ob&s;erv'd may be deduced Conclu&s;ions very in&s;tructive
as to the preceding and &s;ub&s;equent State al&s;o of this World. <HI>Nam Res accent|dunt
lumina Rebus,</HI> and the under&s;tanding the Hi&s;tory of the Cour&s;e and Pro|gre&s;s
of Nature preceding will afford &s;ufficient information of the Method of
preceding, which in mo&s;t things we may find to be very con&s;tant, uniform
and regular. By &s;uch means we hive arriv'd to the pre&s;ent Knowledge of
Caele&s;tial Motion, and by the like, to that we have of the Motions of the Seas
and Winds, and tho' none of the&s;e are yet come to their highe&s;t perfection,
yet Inquiry, and Ratiocination, and Compari&s;on will carry us much further
towards that end, which the compari&s;on of the pre&s;ent &s;tate thereof with
what it was two or three hundred Years &s;ince, will give us good rea&s;on to hope.</P>
<P>It remains then to inquire by what means the&s;e prominent Parts of the
Earth which at pre&s;ent are dry Land, came to be &s;o, &s;ince by the&s;e Te&s;timo|nies
it is, evident that they have been for &s;ome time under the
Water.</P>
<P>And I are in the fir&s;t place I think it will be evident,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This could not be from <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood.</NOTE> that it could not be
from the Flood of <HI>Noah,</HI> &s;ince the duration of that which was but about two
hundred Natural Days, or half an Year could not afford time enough for the
production and perfection of &s;o many and &s;o great and full grown Shells,
as the&s;e which are &s;o found do te&s;tify; be&s;ides the quantity and thickne&s;s of
the Beds of Sand with which they are many times found mixed, do argue.
that there mu&s;t needs be a much longer time of the Seas Re&s;idence above the
&s;ame, than &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace can afford.</P>
<P>Nor could they proceed from a gradual &s;welling of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nor from a gradual &s;wel|ling of the Earth.</NOTE> from a Sub|terraneous
fermentation, which by degrees &s;hould rai&s;e the parts of the Sea
above the Surface thereof; &s;ince if it had been that way, the&s;e Shells would
have been, found only at the top of the Earth or very near it, and not buried at
<PB N="342" REF="321" MS="Y">
&s;o great a depth under it as the In&s;tances I mentioned of the Layer of Shells
in the <HI>Alps</HI> buried under &s;o va&s;t a Mountain, and that near the <HI>Needles</HI> in the
<HI>I&s;le of Wight</HI> found in the middle of an Hill, could not rationally be &s;o
cau&s;ed.</P>
<P>Nor could it proceed wholly from a wa&s;hing of the Water from off the Face
of tho&s;e parts ot the Earth, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nor from the wa&s;hing away by the Water.</NOTE> for how &s;hould the Moun|tain
come to be placed on the top of them.</P>
<P>Now, if after all the&s;e topicks of Proofs, there &s;hall yet remain &s;ome who
will not allow any of them to have been Shells, becau&s;e they are found in the
middle of Stone; I have, as a &s;uppliment, added my Ob&s;ervation of the Place
where, and the Manner how they may be ob&s;erv'd to be &s;o inclo&s;ed, into the
Body of a &s;olid Stone, namely, at a place near the, <HI>Needles,</HI> at the Weft end
of the <HI>I&s;le of Wight.</HI></P>
<P>With &s;uch now as &s;hall not think all, or any of the&s;e convincing; Arguments
to prove them Shells, I cannot, I confe&s;s, conceive what kind ot Arguments
will prevail, &s;ince the&s;e &s;en&s;ible Marks are, in all other things, the Character|iick&s;ts&punc;
Proofs by which to determine of their Nature and Relation, and
why they &s;hould not be allow'd to be &s;o in this particular Ca&s;e I cannot well
conceive.</P>
<P>The great &s;cruples I find are the&s;e;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief Ob|jections.</NOTE> Fir&s;t, That they know not how they
could Come to be placed where they are and have been found; &s;ome Con|jectures
at which I &s;hall after &s;hew.</P>
<P>And Secondly, That many, nay mo&s;t, of them are of $span$ differing
Shape, and of a much greater Magnitude than are the Shell-Fi&s;hes of the
like Animals to be found upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Portland,</HI> or near the places where
they hare been found; and indeed again&s;t this my Hypothe&s;is or A&s;&s;ertion I
find none more pre&s;&s;ingly urged than this, that there is not one to be found
either in the Seas near tho&s;e Parts where &s;uch are found, nor in any part of
the known World, any &s;uch Animals or Vegetables as tho&s;e which are &s;up|po&s;ed
to have afforded the Sub&s;tances of &s;ome of them, or the Moulds of &s;ome
other; and, particularly it has very much been urged upon the Con&s;ideration of
the Petrifaction or <HI>Cornu Ammonis</HI> taken out of the Quarry of Stone in the I&s;le
<HI>Portland,</HI> whether it could be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed that ever there were in the
the World a Species of the <HI>Nautilus</HI> of this &s;hape, and of &s;o va&s;t a bigne&s;s, of
which it is &s;uppo&s;ed the World has not afforded an equal in a living Species.
And I perceive that the very &s;uppo&s;ition is looked upon as very extravagant
and ridiculous. However, it may be possibly worthy some Mens Con&s;idera|tions
to inquire, Fir&s;t, Whether there may not yet be found in the World
many Species of Shell-Fi&s;h they have not hitherto heard of, or &s;een in the
Writings of Natural Hi&s;torians, or in relations of Voyages, or by their own
Experience.</P>
<P>Secondly, Whether the exceeding greatne&s;s of this Shell be a &s;ufficient
Argument to conclude it ridiculous to &s;uppo&s;e, that there could be a living
Fi&s;h that might fill &s;o great a Shell, &s;ince I &s;hew'd the la&s;t Day out of <HI>Maudel&s;lo</HI>
and <HI>Olearius</HI>'s Travels, an in&s;tance of Oy&s;ters found in <HI>Java,</HI> that &s;eem'd much
to exceed this Magnitude: And possibly &s;ome here pre&s;ent may have &s;een,
as well as my &s;elf, the great pair of Shells in the <HI>Mu&s;aeum Harveanum</HI> before
the Fire in 1666. And that the Shells of a <HI>Pinna Marina</HI> are now to be seen
in this Repo&s;itory, which exceed the common bigne&s;s of a Mu&s;cle as much
as this <HI>Cornu Ammonis</HI> doth the &s;maller &s;orts of <HI>Nautili,</HI> and varieth al&s;o as much
from them in Shape: And that hotter Countries, &s;uch as are in the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI>
produce Turtles or Sea Tortoi&s;es, abundantly more exceeding the &s;maller
&s;orts of the&s;e of colder Regions, of which there are Testimonies enough to be
had both from Natural Hi&s;torians and Travellers, which it were nece&s;&s;ary
I could produce.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="322" MS="Y">
But becau&s;e it may be upon this Head further Objected, That all tho&s;e ex|traordinary
great Species, are the productions of the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> or the hot|ter
Climates, and not of the colder, and &s;uch as lie &s;o far remov'd towards
the Poles as <HI>Portland</HI> or <HI>England</HI> do, about which there are now no living
Fi&s;hes to be found that any wi&s;e come near to that Magnitude, but are of
much &s;maller &s;ize and of different &s;hapes.</P>
<P>Therefore before the Opinion be wholly rejected,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>That</HI> England <HI>lay formerly in the</HI> Torrid Zone, <HI>and was there cover'd with the Sea.</HI></NOTE> I would de&s;ire them to
con&s;ider, whether it may not have been po&s;&s;ible, that this very Land of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
and <HI>Portland,</HI> did, at a certain time for &s;ome Ages pa&s;t, lie within the
<HI>Torrid Zone&punc;</HI> and whil&s;t it there re&s;ided, or during its Journying or Pa&s;&s;age
through it, whether it might not be covered with the Sea to a certain height
above the tops of the highest Mountains. And further, how deep this may
have lain below the Surface of the Sea, when it might have been in that Pa&s;|&s;age,
and how long time it may have &s;pent in &s;uch a &s;tate, and how long
&s;ince it may have been emerged. Such as are better ver&s;ed in ancient Hi&s;to|rians
than I ever have been or hope to be, may po&s;ibly re&s;olve &s;ome of the&s;e
Doubts, or at lea&s;t may prove the impo&s;&s;ibility thereof, which may &s;ave fur|ther
t$$uble of inquiry: But if after inquiry it &s;hould be found that Natural
Hi&s;tory is defective in that particular, then I will indeavour to &s;ee what Helps
and Hi&s;tories will be pertinent towards the determination of the&s;e Queries.</P>
<P>And in order to determine the Po&s;&s;ibility or Impo&s;&s;ibility of this Matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Q. Whether the Ocean be every where equally di&s;tant from the Center.</NOTE> I
could wi&s;h it were well con&s;idered further, whether the Superficies of the O|cean
be equally di&s;tant from a Central Point in the Bowels of the Earth, and
whether any other perpendiculars to the Surface thereof, be&s;ides tho&s;e of every
&s;ingle Parallel, and its Poles, do tend to any other Point of its Axis; and if
there &s;hould be found more than one Point, then what are the limiting or
rerminating Points of a Line of &s;uch Points; that is, at what distance they
mu&s;t be from one another, or from a Central Point? This I mention'd in
two of my preceding Lectures, the one read about ten or twelve Years &s;ince,
and in the other about two Years &s;ince; in both which I indeavour'd to &s;hew
that the form of the Earth was probably &s;omewhat flatter towards the Poles
than towards the Equinoctial, &s;ince which I have met with &s;ome Ob&s;ervations
that do &s;eem to make a probability in my Conjecture and Hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>The <HI>Antipodes</HI> were once thought a Chimera, length of time hath made that
notion more reconcileable to Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on; the&s;e may po&s;&s;ibly at fir&s;t
hearing appear much more extravagant, and Time that brings all to Light,
may po&s;&s;ibly evidence them to be nothing but <HI>Chimaera</HI>'s; I will not pre|judge,
nor pre-po&s;&s;e&s;s&punc; but leave them to their Fortune. However it were
de&s;irable by the Experience and Inquiry of a &s;hort time to di&s;patch and ha|&s;ten
the Growth and Ripenings of the Productions of Nature, &s;ince the Ex|perience
and Duration of a Man, whether he looks forward or backward, is
very &s;hort in compari&s;on of what &s;eems requi&s;ite for this Determination; his
Sight is weak and dim, his Power and Reach much &s;horter, yet may it be
worth con&s;idering (tho' he cannot lengthen or prolong his limited time ei|ther
pa&s;t or to-come), whether by Tele&s;copes or Micro&s;copes he may not &s;ee
&s;ome hundreds of Years backwards and forward, and di&s;tingui&s;h by &s;uch Mi|cro&s;copes
and Tele&s;copes Events &s;o far di&s;tant both before and behind him&s;elf
in time, as if clo&s;e by, and now pre&s;ent? And whether by In&s;truments he
may not extend his Power, and reach things far above his Head, and far be|neath
his Feet, in the highe&s;t parts of the Heavens, and the lowe&s;t parts of
the Earth; for could he perform things of this Nature and Quality as they
ought to be, he would lengthen his Life and increa&s;e the injoyments thereof
by a multiply'd and condens'd knowledge of times pa&s;t, and of times al&s;o yet to come.</P>
<P>But before we come to this la&s;t Expedient, I could wi&s;h we had a good Ac|count
and Collection of what Hi&s;tories pertinent to this, or any other Na|tural
Inquiry are to be found in Printed or Written Authors, which I
conceive is yet a <HI>De&s;ideratum;</HI> and that this is po&s;&s;ible to be &s;o I &s;hall menti|on

Character and about the Chine&s;e Printing. Inquiring then about <HI>Tartary</HI>
<PB N="344" REF="323">
and <HI>China,</HI> upon occa&s;ion of the Di&s;cour&s;e that was here lately made, I found
that in <HI>Purchas</HI> his Pilgrims there is a part of the Works of <HI>Roger Bacon</HI> pub|li&s;h'd,
whereby I find that he &s;o long &s;ince knew they had a way of Printing,
and had a better account of their Character than any one,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Page</HI> 58. <HI>Part</HI> 3.</NOTE> or all we have
&s;ince that time. <HI>Sciendum quod a$principio Cataia Magnae Nigrae u&s;&abque; ad &s;inem o|rientis

note only by the bye, that both the <HI>Jugres</HI> and <HI>Cata$ans,</HI> tho&s;e of <HI>Tebet</HI> and
<HI>Tangut,</HI> may be &s;aid to write all the &s;ame way with us, for that they differ
only in the Po&s;ition of the Page as to the Eye when read or writ. Next, as
to the u&s;e of Printing, he &s;ays in the &s;ame Page, &s;peaking of the Money of
the <HI>Cataians. I&s;torum Cataiarum moneta vulgaris e&s;t charta de homba&s;i$ in qua im|primunt
qua&s;dam Lineas.</HI> This I &s;uppo&s;e he took in part out of the Voyage of
<HI>Gulielmus de Rubriques,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Frier, who wrote an account of his Travels into
tho&s;e Ea&s;tern Parts to the King of <HI>France,</HI> and for divers Rea&s;ons I believe
it to be a very true Relation, for I find in the thirty &s;ixth Chapter of his Book
as follows. &startq;The common Money of <HI>Cataia</HI> is Paper made of Bomba&s;t the
length of an Hand, upon which they imprint Lines, like the Seale of <HI>Man|gu,</HI>
they write with a Pen&s;il wherewith Painters Paint, and in one Figure
they make many Letters comprehending one word. The People of <HI>Thebet</HI>
write as we do, and they have Characters very like ours. They of <HI>Tangu</HI>
write from the right Hand unto the Left, as the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and multiply
the Lines a&s;cending upwards.&endq; <HI>Jugur,</HI> as afore&s;aid from above downwards.
This is very much the &s;ame with <HI>Roger Bacon,</HI> whereby we had above four
hundred Years &s;ince a hint of the Chine&s;e Printing; as al&s;o that the Chine&s;e
Characters were compounded of certain Elements, which expre&s;&s;ed both a
literal and philo&s;ophical Word. I have one Ob&s;ervation more to add before
I leave this Digre&s;&s;ion, and that is in an&s;wer to another Objection which was
made again&s;t my Conjecture of the deducing the Name of <HI>Cornu Ammonis,</HI>
or Sand Horns from a probability that they might po&s;&s;ibly be found in tho&s;e
Sandy De&s;erts of <HI>Pentapolitana</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> now call'd <HI>Barca,</HI> which lieth We&s;t
of <HI>Egypt,</HI> between that and <HI>Afri$a Minor,</HI> almo&s;t oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Morea</HI> of
<HI>Greece,</HI> a large and barren &s;andy De&s;ert, trouble&s;ome to be travailed in, by
rea&s;on of the in&s;tability of the Footing, and for that the Sand is thrown
to and fro by the Wind, in the mid&s;t of which &s;tood the Temple of <HI>Jupiter
Ammon</HI> who&s;e Effigies was adorn'd with&punc; Horns &s;uppo&s;ed to be Rams Horns, but
I conjectur'd they might po&s;&s;ibly be the re&s;emblance of tho&s;e petrify'd <HI>Nautili,</HI>
found in that Sand. To this Conjecture I have only this to add, Fir&s;t, That
<HI>Lucan</HI> in the de&s;cribing this Idol, calls him <HI>Corniger,</HI> which &s;eems to argue,
that the Statue had Horns. But which &s;eems more to agree with my Con|jecture,
is what is related of the form of this Idol by <HI>Curtius,</HI> that it was
without the form of any Creature, but like a round Bo&s;s or Navel, (<HI>&V;mbilicus</HI>
is the word) be&s;et with Jewels; this was carried in Proce&s;&s;ion by the Prie&s;ts in
a guilded Ship hung with Bells on both &s;ides, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which it &s;hould &s;eem
that the very Idol it&s;elf was nothing but &s;uch a <HI>Nautilus</HI> Petrify'd, as I have
produced, be&s;et round with Jewels for ornament, and carry'd in a Ship po&s;|&s;ibly
as a Hieroglyphick, to &s;ignifie the manner of &s;ome eminent Deliverance
of that Country from a former Flood, or the u&s;e of Ships in that place,
whil&s;t an I&s;land and that De&s;ert was cover'd with Water. But this is only
Conjectural, which I &s;ubmit to further examination.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="324">
But to leave this Digre&s;&s;ion and proceed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Searching of Natural Hi&s;to|ries u&s;eful.</NOTE> I &s;ay, it were very de&s;irable in
order to the &s;olution of this and divers other Inquiries in Natural Philo&s;ophy;
that we had a Collection of Such Ob&s;ervations as are to be found, already
made and recorded in Natural Hi&s;tories, to &s;ee what Light &s;uch Hi&s;tories
would afford, which may be perform'd by the joint Labour of many Per&s;ons
who would peru&s;e and collect &s;uch Matters; but po&s;&s;ibly it may be believ'd
that little can be found pertinent to this Inquiry, as indeed I fear there will
be no great matter; yet <HI>Pliny</HI> in the tenth Chapter of his thirty &s;ixth Book
takes notice of a matter which is not altogether impertinent, affirming, that
an Obelisk &s;et up by <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> for &s;hewing the length of the Day, was found af|ter
&s;ome time to go fal&s;e.</P>
<P>But upon this I build no great matter, and I fear the ancient Ob&s;ervations
will in general help us no great matter, though they may give us cau&s;e of
&s;u&s;picion, as particularly concerning the Latitudes of Places, of which Mr.
<HI>Vernon</HI>
takes notice that the pre&s;ent Latitude of <HI>Athens</HI> is near two degrees
differing from that a&s;&s;ign'd it by <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> which is remarkable, it being of a
Place &s;o eminently known in former Ages. But upon neither of the&s;e can
much be built as to the accuracy of determining &s;uch a motion; tho' they
may &s;erve well enough for hints for Inquiry farther concerning them. Mon|&s;ieur
<HI>Pettit</HI> has al&s;o written a Treati&s;e to prove that the Latitude of <HI>Paris</HI> is
differing from what it was formerly. <HI>Scaliger</HI> al&s;o had a notion of &s;ome &s;uch
matter, but I connot tell what he would have, nor do I believe he well knew
him&s;elf. The place is quoted in <HI>Chilmedes</HI> Engli&s;h Edition of <HI>Hues de Globis;</HI>
others al&s;o have mention'd it, but none have determin'd it or brought it to a
certainty. I did therefore upon this occa&s;ion, where I am di&s;cour&s;ing con|cerning
the general form and the proprieties or Motions of this great Body
of the Earth, think fit to in&s;ert it as a thing worthy of determination; &s;ince
'tis not improbable but that there may be &s;ome &s;uch motion of the Earths
<HI>Axis</HI> as may alter both the Latitudes of Places, and al&s;o the po&s;ition of the
Meridional Line. And that this may not &s;eem &s;o ab&s;urd, we may con&s;ider the
alteration of the <HI>Axis</HI> of the Earth in re&s;pect of the fixt Stars long &s;ince dis|cover'd,
and the variation of the magnetical <HI>Axis</HI> di&s;cover'd fir&s;t about fifty
Years &s;ince by &s;ome of the Profe&s;&s;ors of this Colledge.</P>
<P>But now the Que&s;tion is how the&s;e general Queries can be determin'd;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Some General Queries.</HI></NOTE>
that is, Fir&s;t, <HI>Whether there be any alteration of the gravitating Center of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Whether the Body of the Earth be of a true Spherical or Oval Figure,<MILESTONE N="2">

Tho' this be propo&s;ed only as an Hypothe&s;is, yet the Author thinks it de&s;erves examina|tion

<P><MILESTONE N="1">MY Fir&s;t Propo&s;ition then is this, That we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e Fir&s;t, That
this Globe or Ball of the Earth was carried round the Sun in the
plain of the Ecliptick, making an entire Revolution in that Plain once in
a twelvemonth, and thereby making the Sun to appear to pa&s;s continually in
the Ecliptick Line, as <HI>Pythagorus, Ari&s;tarchus Samius, Copernicus,</HI> &amp;c, have
&s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2">Secondly, That this Globe or Ball whil&s;t it maketh one &s;uch Revolution, is
likewi&s;e whirled round three hundred &s;ixty and five times, and about &frac14; upon
an <HI>Axis,</HI> or imaginary Line pa&s;&s;ing through, or near the Center thereof,
which <HI>Axis,</HI> is all the while kept in an Inclination to the &s;aid Plain of 23 &frac12;.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3">Thirdly, That, this <HI>Axis</HI> doth continually keep a Paralleli&s;m to it&s;elf very
near; all which <HI>Axes</HI> at pre&s;ent re&s;pect a Point in the Heavens, not far di|&s;tant
from the la&s;t Star of the Tail of the little Bear call'd the <HI>Pole-&s;tar,</HI> but
heretofore 'twas at a greater di&s;tance from it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4">Fourthly, That this <HI>Axis</HI> doth, in proce&s;s of time, vary its re&s;pect to that
Star or Point of the Heavens, and by degrees proceed nearer towards it, not
directly, but in a Circle parallel to the Ecliptick, or who&s;e Center is the Pole
of the Ecliptick. Thus far I take the &s;ame with the Hypothe&s;is of <HI>Copernicus</HI>
and his Followers. But</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="5">Fifthly, I &s;uppo&s;e yet further, that the <HI>Ax$$</HI> of the <HI>$span$</HI> of the
Earth hath al&s;o had a progre&s;&s;ive motion, and hath, in proce&s;s of time, been
chang'd in po&s;ition within the Body of the Earth, and con&s;equently that
the Poler points upon the Surface of the Earth, have alter'd their Situation;
&s;o that the pre&s;ent Polar Points, have formerly been di&s;tant from tho&s;e Poles
that were then; and con&s;equently that tho&s;e former Polar Points are now re|mov'd
to a certain di&s;tance from the pre&s;ent, and move in Circles about
the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6">Sixthly, I &s;uppo&s;e that the Form of the Surface of the Water at lea&s;t, is,
and hath been, ever &s;ince the duration or the Earth, or an <HI>O$al Form,</HI> who&s;e
longe&s;t Diameters lye in the Plain of the Equinoctial, and who&s;e &s;horte&s;t is
the <HI>Axis</HI> it&s;elf of the &s;aid Rotation.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="7">Seventhly, As a Con&s;equent of this I &s;uppo&s;e the Center of <HI>Gravity</HI> of the
Earth to be drawn out into a Line into the <HI>Ax$s</HI> thereof, and con&s;equently in|to
infinite Centers, there being one for every Parallel Line upon the Surface
of the Earth, and that no perpendiculars but tho&s;e of the Poles and Aequi|noctial,
re&s;pect or tend directly to the Central Point, but that all the Per|pendiculars
from the other Parallels re&s;pect certain Points in the oppo&s;ite
Parts of the <HI>Axis</HI> which are &s;o much the further remov'd from the Center, by
<PB N="347" REF="326">
how much the nearer the Parallels approach the Polar Points; which Points
of Gravitations and Po&s;ition of Perpendiculars in re&s;pect of the <HI>Axis,</HI> may
be determin'd both <HI>a Priori</HI> by Theory, and al&s;o <HI>a Po&s;teriori</HI> by Experiments
or Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Eighthly, As a Con&s;equent of the&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, that in proce&s;s of time<MILESTONE N="8">
there will be cau&s;ed an alteration of the gravitating Power and Tendency of
the Parts of the Earth, both Solid and Fluid, and that according as the Po&s;i|tions
of them are alter'd in re&s;pect of the Polar Points, either pre&s;ent Pre|cedent
or Sub&s;equent, there will be cau&s;ed in the</P>
<P>Ninth Place, an indeavour of &s;liding, &s;ub&s;iding, &s;inking and changing of the<MILESTONE N="9">
Internal Parts of the Earth, as well as External, tho' the latter will be more
powerful, as being more affected by the Rotation thereof; and this may cau&s;e
in the</P>
<P>Tenth Place, an alteration in the Magnetical Power and Vertue of the Bo|dy<MILESTONE N="10">
of the Earth, e&s;pecially of &s;uch Parts as are more loo&s;e and of a more
fluid Nature. And</P>
<P>In th Eleventh Place, may be a cau&s;e al&s;o of &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>Tremores Terr$,</HI><MILESTONE N="11">
or Earthquakes which have in all Ages been in the Earth, tho' we have no
Hi&s;tories or Records that have pre&s;erved the Memory of them, but only &s;uch
Signs and Monuments as they have left by the unequal ragged and torn Face
of the Surface of the Land and the Bodies that are di&s;covered; which proves
that they had &s;ome time an other Po&s;ition than they are found to have at the
pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The&s;e two la&s;t notwith&s;tanding I do not &s;uppo&s;e the only cau&s;es of the&s;e
Effects of Earthquakes, no nor the Principal, but only as concurring and ad|juvant
Cau&s;es which may have their Effects in &s;ome mea&s;ure, but how far and
how powerful they may be &s;uppo&s;ed, will be proper to be re&s;olved under
the Heads of Magneti&s;ms and Earthquakes, and more e&s;pecially under
that of the Air. The &s;ame Principles or Suppo&s;itions will al&s;o produce in
the</P>
<P>Twelfth Place; a more than ordinary &s;welling or ri&s;ing of the Sea in tho&s;e<MILESTONE N="12">
Parts which are near the Aequinoctiai, and a &s;inking and $$$$eding of the Sea
from tho$ which are near the Poles; &s;o that as any Parts do increa&s;e in
their Latitudes, &s;o will the Sea grow &s;hallower, and as their Latitudes de|crea&s;e,
&s;o mu&s;t the Sea &s;well and grow high; by which means many &s;ubma|rine
Regions mu&s;t become dry Land, and many other Lands will be overflown
by the Sea, and the&s;e variations being &s;low, and by degrees will leave very la|&s;ting
Remarks of &s;ush States and Po&s;itions, in the &s;uperficial Sub&s;tances of
the Earth.</P>
<P>And hence al&s;o will follow in the Thirteenth Place, a great alteration and<MILESTONE N="13">
variety of the Productions of tho&s;e Parts which are thus alter'd in their Po&s;i|tion,
whether they are parts of the Sea or parts of the Land; for as there
&s;eems to be &s;omewhat which is peculiar to this or that Soyl or Spot of Land
whereby this or that Animal or Vegetable doth grow and thrive and increa&s;e
both in Quantity and Quality, and the contrary: So is there al&s;o &s;omewhat
in the Climate and Po&s;ition to the Sun and Heavens, which doth as power|fully
at lea&s;t, if not much more, affect the Productions, Propagations, &amp;c. of
Plants and Animals. And as 'tis a known Ob&s;ervation, that in the &s;ame
Country, this or that Field, or Soil is more effective or this or that u&s;e; &s;o
'tis as well known that the tran&s;planting of animate Subjects to differing Cli|mates,
tho' the Soil &s;eems of the &s;ame Nature, doth as effectually co-operate
in the changing or alteration of them. And hereby a fruitful Land may be
turned into Barrenne&s;&s;, and be made unfit for Production as well as Barren
and U&s;ele&s;s may be made Fruitful; for that the Temper and Con&s;titution of
a Soil may be &s;uch as to be fit for many purpo&s;es in &s;ome Climates, which in o|thers
is fit for nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="327">
<MILESTONE N="14">From hence al&s;o will follow in the Fourteenth Place, That many places
which by degrees are made Submarine, will be cover'd with various Coats or
Layers of Earth; &s;o that the former Surface of it, when Land will not only
be drown'd with Water, but buried under Earth; for that, as the parts of
the Land, are continually wa&s;hed down; and by the Rivers carried into the
Sea, and there depo&s;ited in the Submarine Regions, &s;o much more power|fully
and plentifully are the higher parts of the Submarine Regions by Tides,
Currents, and other Agitations of the Water, removed and tran&s;ported, into
the lower, partly by &s;inking out of the muddy Water, but principally by
tumbling and rowling down from the higher, which &s;orts of covering or
burying Earth mu&s;t be po&s;ited in certain Layers or Stratifications of divers
kinds of Sub&s;tances according to the nature of tho&s;e which are this or that
way brought thither, and there depo&s;ited. Hence al&s;o it will follow, that the
Earth it&s;elf doth, as it were, wa&s;h and &s;mooth its own Face, and by degrees
to remove all the Warts, Furrows, Wrinckles and Holes of her Skin, which
Age and Di&s;tempers have produced.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="15">And hence in the Fifteenth Place will follow, That &s;uch Regions as have
for a time been Submarine, and produced Sub&s;tances of Animals or Vege|tables
proper for them, when they come to be dry Land and to lye above the
Waters, mu&s;t produce Animals and Vegetables proper and peculiar to that
Soil, Element and Climate they are then furni&s;h'd with; pre&s;erving in the
mean time the Characteri&s;ticks and Marks of the former Qualifications, when
in another Condition.</P>
<P>But &s;ome po&s;&s;ibly may be ready to &s;ay before a thorough examination, that
this is only a &s;uppo&s;ition, and that there are no &s;uch Phaenomena as here are
put for the Suppo&s;ition: Others, that 'tis fooli&s;h to make an Hypothe&s;is for
the &s;olving of any one Phaenomenon. Others may po&s;&s;ibly demand how
comes this to be now di&s;cover'd, which none hath hitherto known? Or how
is this to be proved? By what Hi&s;tory? By what Signs and Tokens? I mu&s;t
leave every one to his own freedom to judge as he &s;ees cau&s;e, and cen&s;ure as
he pica&s;es; however, I conceive it <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> ea&s;y to play the
Momus or the Mimick. <HI>Sed &s;i$uis quid rectius i&s;lus a$&s;$$t, $andidus $mper$$$.</HI>
But if he know better let him not, hold his Tongue but tell us. I
&s;hall not impo&s;e on any; I propound it only as an Hypothe&s;is, and have
&s;hewed what will be the Con&s;equences of it, whether there be Phaenomena
an&s;werable to be ob&s;erv'd let it be examin'd; and let there be produce'd
another Hypothe&s;is that will &s;olve the various Phaenomena that are to be
every where met with better; for that I have no farther de&s;ign in propound|ing
it than to have it &s;trictly examin'd, and in order thereunto to have &s;uch
Ob&s;ervations made and taken notice of for the future as may a&s;certain the
Truth whether for or again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Yet give me leave to add a word or two, before I wholly leave it to its Fortune.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The &s;upp$&s;$$ on $word$. not impo&s;|&s;ible.</HI></NOTE> I &s;ay, That what is here &s;uppo&s;ed in not impo&s;&s;ible. Fir&s;t, 'Tis
not impo&s;&s;ible from the Natural Hi&s;tory now to be met with of the things
&s;uppo&s;ed; for that all things may be the &s;ame as they now appear, and yet
this may be true; for no one Phaenomenon, that I can think, of, is contradict|ed
by it, either fetch'd out of ancient Hi&s;tories, or yet Collected by pre&s;ent
Ob&s;ervation. As there are no Ob&s;ervations of Latitudes, or fixed, accurate
meridian Lines, or Eclip&s;es for the Oval Shadow of the Earth, or Men&s;ura|tion
of Degrees to find their difference in differing Latitudes. Nor Secondly,
Is it impo&s;&s;ible from the Nature of the things &s;uppo&s;ed, for that there is as
yet no certain Cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned, why the Earth doth move upon the <HI>Axis,</HI> it
now doth, and not upon another, nor why it &s;hould always continue and re|main
the &s;ame without change, contrary to all other motions in Nature. Nor
is it impo&s;&s;ible becau&s;e not di&s;cover'd before, which yet is more than can be
po&s;itively proved; for if &s;o, then would Magnetical Motions fall under the
&s;ame Cen&s;ure, as al&s;o, Optick-gla&s;&s;es, Guns, Printing, and other new di&s;|coveries.

<P>Secondly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2dly, <HI>Notridiculous.</HI></NOTE> I &s;ay for it, that 'tis no more folly to invent new Hypothe&s;es to

If the gravitating Power of the Earth be every where equal, as I know
no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e the contrary, then mu&s;t this Power be compounded with
a contrary indeavour of heavy Bodies to recede from the Axis of its Motion,
if it be &s;uppo&s;ed to be mov'd with a diurnal Revolution upon its Axis, and
con&s;equently a part of the gravity of &s;uch Bodies towards the Center mu&s;t be
taken off by this <HI>Conatus,</HI> which is every where oblique, but only under the
Aequinoctial, which mu&s;t therefore mo&s;t dimini&s;h its Gravitation, and con|&s;equently
the gravity will act the mo&s;t freely and powerfully under the Poles;
and the more powerfully the nearer the Bodies are plac'd to tho&s;e Poles,
and that Phaenomena do an&s;wer to this Theory, has been verify'd, fir&s;t by Mr.
<HI>Hally</HI> at St. <HI>Helena,</HI> and &s;ince by the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Cayen,</HI> and now lately in <HI>Siam,</HI>
in all which places it is affirmed, that 'twas nece&s;&s;ary to &s;horten the Pendulum
to make it keep its due Time.</P>
<P>In the Second Place for the <HI>variation of the Axis of Rotation</HI> in the Body of
the Earth.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the varia|tion of the Axis.</HI></NOTE> I &s;ay it is con&s;onant to all the other motions of Nature: For
fir&s;t it is found that the <HI>Axes</HI> of the <HI>Ellip&s;es</HI> of the Planets do vary a little, I
&s;ay a little (tho' Mr. <HI>Street</HI> only will have them not to vary at all) becau&s;e all
A&s;tronomers have hitherto affirmed, that they do, and from my own Ma|thematical
Hypothe&s;is I collect the &s;ame, tho' it be but a little, yet it is &s;ome|what,
&s;ince there is &s;ome impediment in the Medium. Next there is al&s;o
a motion in the Nodes, all which are very eminent in the Moon. And a|gain,
the direction of the <HI>Axis</HI> in the Earth is varied as to its re&s;pect to the
Heavens, which the prece&s;&s;ion of the Aequinoxes do manife&s;t. Nay yet fur|ther,
the <HI>Axis</HI> of the Magnetical Motions which is within the very Body of
the Earth, and &s;eems even to go through its very Center, hath, about fifty
Years &s;ince, been prov'd to vary al&s;o &s;omewhat analogous to this which I have
&s;uppo&s;ed, whereby both the Magnetical Latitudes, and Magnetical Meridi|ans
have mo&s;t certainly been varied; which &s;eems abundantly more difficult
to be granted than this which I propound, did not certain Ob&s;ervations
both here at home and all over the World confirm the truth of Matter of
Fact, and that becau&s;e this doth &s;eem to prove a motion of a Magnetical
Core or Magnetical Globe of the Earth, within this outward earthy and wa|tery
Shell; whereas this which I &s;uppo&s;e is nothing but a progre&s;&s;ion of the
<HI>Axis</HI> of Rotation, which may be caus'd by the vi&s;ible accidental Mutations of
the outward and &s;uperficial Parts, as well as by other unknown alterations
which may &s;ucceed within the Bowels of the Earth. So that 'tis very pro|bable
that there is &s;ome &s;uch motion of the &s;aid <HI>Axis,</HI> &s;ince we are certain
both of outward and inward changes.</P>
<P>It only remains then Po&s;itively and Experimentally, or Hi&s;torically to prove
the Reality thereof. Now the motion of the Mutation thereof being but
&s;low, as I conceive, and the Ob&s;ervations of the Antients Recorded in Hi|&s;tories
nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e, being &s;o unaccurate and uncertain for &s;uch
a determination as this, I fear they cannot be rely'd upon; but whatever
&s;hall be alledg'd as a proof of this Theory, will be attributed to a fault in the
Antient Ob&s;ervation, as that <HI>Ptolomy</HI> puts the Latitude of <HI>London</HI> 52 10
and the longe&s;t Day 17 Hours. Nor will I in&s;i&s;t on the Latitude of <HI>Athens</HI>

tho' all the&s;e were remarkable places, as was al&s;o <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> but rather re|ly
upon Ob&s;ervations to be made for the future; the way of performing
which I &s;hall treat of hereafter, whereby I &s;hall &s;hew, how, in a &s;hort time,

<P>WHat I propounded the la&s;t Day by way of an Hypothe&s;is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suppo&s;itions as extravagaut have been made.</NOTE> may po&s;&s;ibly
be look'd upon not not only as very extravagant, but very improb|able;
from the la&s;t of which I hope I did then clear it; and as to its extra|vagancy,
I hope I may be able to &s;hew, that there have been &s;uppo&s;itions al|together
as extravagant, which yet have not only been made, but accepted
and imbraced, and for many Ages as &s;tifly defended as the mo&s;t probable.
My In&s;tance &s;hall be in the <HI>Ptolomaick,</HI> Hypothe&s;is of the Heavens, which,
that you may the better judge of, I have here a Book to &s;hew the whole
De&s;ign and Intrigue of it, in which the &s;ame and all its parts are mo&s;t curi|ou&s;ly
delineated, whereby all the Wheel-work may be at once di&s;cover'd;
and if it be de&s;ir'd to be made in Clock-work, I have another Author that &s;hall
give the bigne&s;s of the Wheels, and the number of the Teeth and Pinions
nece&s;&s;ary to accompli&s;h the &s;ame in Clock-work: And yet when all is done,
there will want as many more to make out all the irregularities of appear|ances
exact; the rea&s;on of which proceeded from one fal&s;e Principle, that one
Body was capable&punc; of no more than one &s;imple motion, whereas in truth there
is no body mov'd but is capable of, nay, actually mov'd by thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>But it may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;aid that this <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> was the Product of an Age
not &s;o inqui&s;itive and able to judge as the pre&s;ent, which will hardly be im|pos'd
on with &s;uch improbabilities; nor was all this clutter thought nece&s;|&s;ary
at fir&s;t, but the maintainers of that Opinion, to make out the appear|ances,
as well as they could, have &s;ince found it nece&s;&s;ary to help out the fir&s;t
Invention by additional Expedients; and if the&s;e were &s;ufficient, I conceive
it might yet be an acceptable <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> tho' we have no <HI>Medium</HI> to prove
that there is any &s;uch thing in Nature as a <HI>Solid Orbe,</HI> or a moving <HI>Genius.</HI></P>
<P>The like favour I hope may be allow'd to what I propound, if upon due ex|amination
the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> are an&s;werable to what the <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> does hint.</P>
<P>Now what would be con&s;equential to what I have propounded, I &s;hew'd the
la&s;t Day; it only now remains to examine whether Phaenomena do an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then to determine whether the Figure of the Sea from North to South
be Oval,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t. <HI>of the Figure of the Sea.</HI></NOTE> &s;welling towards the Aequinoctial and depre&s;s'd towards the Poles,
it will be nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome few Trials, Ob&s;ervations and Experiments.</P>
<P>And Fir&s;t for Experiments that may be made here.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Experiments to prove it.</HI></NOTE> Let a Bowl or Bubble
of Gla&s;s be made and melted in a Lamp, and when &s;o melted let it be blown
into a hollow Ballor Bubble, which will naturally form and Shape it&s;elf into a
round and &s;pherical Body, e&s;pecially if the Sub&s;tance be of an equal thick|ne&s;s
and equal heat, which let be examin'd; then let the &s;ame be melted
again as before, and as it is blowing, let it be mov'd round upon the Pipe, by
<PB N="351" REF="330">
which it is blown, by a pretty quick Circular Motion, and you will find that
in&s;tead of the Spherical Figure it will receive an Oval one, &s;uch as I &s;uppo&s;e
the Surface of the Sea to have. This Experiment I &s;hall by and by &s;hew here
(which was accordingly done).</P>
<P>Now in this Experiment here are evidently two kinds of Powers that coope|rate
in the production of this Form. The fir&s;t is that of the Congruity of the
Matter, which, as I have many Years &s;ince in a &s;mall Treati&s;e, Printed in
the Year 1660, proved, doth &s;hape the Gla&s;s into a true Spherical Figure,
and &s;o maketh every part to indeavour towards the Center of the whole.
The next is that of the vertiginous Motion, which giveth to every part, an
indeavour to recede from the <HI>Axis</HI> of the vertiginous Motion; this driveth
the &s;hape of the whole into that Oval Form it receiveth and retaineth.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Experiment may be much better made at the Gla&s;s-hou&s;e, where
a greater quantity of Gla&s;s may be melted, and that more equally and a
quicker Motion may be given, which will make the Experiment the more
&s;en&s;ible, the Gla&s;s retaining its melted heat much longer. Be&s;ides, it may
be there tried with a &s;olid lump of Gla&s;s which will receive the &s;ame Figure
from a vertiginous Motion about the Puntilion. And again, to make the
Gla&s;s Oval the other way, the &s;ame is whirled round with a motion where|in
the Puntilion is made the Radius of the vertiginous Motion.</P>
<P>A &s;econd Experiment to &s;hew that the Water doth naturally recede from
the Poles towards the Aequinoctial is this. Take a round Di&s;h of Water,
and let it be &s;et upon a Stand where it may be gently mov'd round upon an
an Axis pa&s;&s;ing through the Center of the Di&s;h perpendicularly; fir&s;t ob&s;erve
the Surface of the Water when it &s;tands &s;till without motion, there you find
it &s;mooth aud horizontal; then move the &s;tand gently round by degrees, till
you find the Water begins to receive the motion of the Di&s;h; then examine
the Surface thereof and you will perceive the Water to &s;ink in the middle,
and to recede and &s;well towards the Circumference of the Di&s;h: And the
better to &s;atisfie you I have prepared the Experiment which I will by and by
&s;hew. The Experiments are plain and common, yet I humbly conceive not
le&s;s in&s;tuctive to the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y, than the mo&s;t pompous and more
chargeable Experiments.</P>
<P>This la&s;t Experiment doth hint, that the Convexity of the Sea near the
Poles of the Earth mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be much flatter than el&s;ewhere,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Superfi$i$ of the Sea next the Poles po&s;|&s;ibly Concave.</HI></NOTE> and not
only le&s;s Spherical than the re&s;t of the Sea, but po&s;&s;ibly plain, nay, beyond
a plain, po&s;&s;ibly Concave, for that the Water cannot but have or receive from
the vertiginous Motion, an endeavour to recede from the Center of that
Motion, and the Gravity of the Earth working there more powerfully and
freely. But this only by the bye. But which &s;eems more material, I con|ceive
that a Degree of Latitude, if there mea&s;ured would be very much long|er
than a Degree of Latitude under the Aequinoctial, of which I &s;hall &s;peak
more by and by.</P>
<P>In the next place then we are to con&s;ider what other Ob&s;ervations and Tri|als
will &s;erve to the direct and po&s;itive proof of this <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;ervations to prove the The|ory.</NOTE> <HI>That the Figure
of the Earth is that of a prolated Sphaeroide, not of an oblong Sphaeroide, nor of a Sphaere.</HI>
And tho&s;e may be ranged under two Heads, Fir&s;t, Such as are con&s;equential
Proofs drawn from the &s;imilitude in Nature's Operations, on other Bodies
&s;imilarily affected. And Secondly, Tho&s;e which more immediately and po|&s;itively
prove the Effects thereof upon the very Body of the Earth it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ort of Ob&s;ervations are to be fetch'd from the Caele&s;tial Bodies,
&s;uch as we are a&s;&s;ur'd by Ob&s;ervation have a vertiginous Motion about their
Axis, as Hypothetically only we &s;uppo&s;e the Earth to have; &s;uch are the Body
of the Sun Primarily and Principally, which was di&s;cover'd by <HI>Galileo,</HI> and
prov'd and perfected by <HI>Scheiner;</HI> next the Body of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which was fir&s;t
found to move about its own Axis, in the Year 1664, and which has &s;ince
been perfected by <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini.</HI> Now, if by exactly examining the true Diameters ot
the Sun when we are in the plain of its Aequinoctial (which is in the beginning
of <HI>June</HI> and of <HI>December,</HI>) if I &s;ay by Trial, we find that the Diameter <HI>per Axin</HI>
of the Sun is &s;horter than the Diameter of its Aequator, then there will be a
<PB N="352" REF="331">
further probability that the like may be in the Earth if it be &s;o mov'd, as is
now generally &s;uppo&s;ed: The liketrial may be made of the like Axis of <HI>Jupiter</HI>
though the Trials will be therein more difficult, as being much le&s;s &s;en&s;ible,
from the &s;mallne&s;s of the Difference; however 'tis worth examining, as it will
be to examine al&s;o the Diameters of <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> when they pa&s;s un|der
the Sun, tho' we are not yet a&s;&s;ur'd of their vertiginous Motion, and if
Mon&s;.<HI>Gallets</HI> Ob&s;ervation may be credited, &s;uch a <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> was taken no|tice
of by him in the late tran&s;it of &Merc; <HI>Sub Sole,</HI> as appears by his account of
the Pa&s;&s;age of &Merc; <HI>Sub Sole,</HI> Printed in a Treati&s;e by it&s;elf, and in the Journal
<HI>des Scavans.</HI> Now, if this Ob&s;ervation do an&s;wer in the Diameters of the
Sun, it will afford us al&s;o a further information of the Nature of that Glorio|us
Body, and will, I conceive, prove it to be of a fluid and yielding Sub&s;tance,
e&s;pecially the &s;hining and &s;uperficial parts thereof. Trial al&s;o may
be made of the like Diameters of the <HI>Moon,</HI> tho' her vertiginous Motion in
compari&s;on of her bulk, be the &s;low&s;t of all we yet know as turning round
on her Axis but once in a Month. The like may be made of the Body of <HI>Sa|turn,</HI>
when the Ring is &s;o po&s;ited as that the Diameters that lye in the longer
and &s;horter Diameters of the Ring may be plainly di&s;cover'd; what the rea|&s;on
of that Ring may be I &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e of el&s;ewhere. The&s;e I &s;uppose
will be the ea&s;ie&s;t and &s;oone&s;t made, and if judiciou&s;ly and accurately per|form'd,
with a due regard of Refraction, and the true po&s;ition of the Axis,
will give a great probability or improbability to this &s;uppo&s;ael, but &s;till I confe&s;s
it will afford no more than a probable Argument either for or again&s;t it:
However, that probability being very great, and the trial not very difficult; it
will be well to make the Ob&s;ervations, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Suns Diameter,
with all imaginable accuratene&s;s, which may be done to a very great one, if
there be fit In&s;truments and &s;ufficient Care u&s;ed therein, &s;o as very many
times to out &s;trip all that I have hitherto met with of that kind, the whole
method of which will be too long and tedious now to explain; however, if I
can procure A&s;&s;i&s;tance, I re&s;olve to try it this following <HI>June,</HI> which is much
the be&s;t time of the whole Year to avoid the inconveniency of Refractions,
and the true Phaenomena thereof I will produce here, without being bia&s;&s;ed
for this Hypothe&s;is, for which I have no further concern than as it &s;hall be
found agreable to the truth of Appearances. Now, tho' I confe&s;s al&s;o,
that I cannot expect that the difference of the longer Diameter in the Sun
from the &s;horter will be very much in regard of the very &s;trong power of Gra|vity
in that Glorious Body whereby it is able to detain all the planetary
Bodies in their Orbs from running from him, and even that of <HI>Saturn</HI> &s;o va&s;t|ly
remov'd; yet when I compare that with the Magnitude of its Body, and
the time of its Rotation, I am apt to think that accurate Trials may di&s;|cover
&s;ome &s;en&s;ible difference, which I mu&s;t leave to Trial.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;ort of Ob&s;ervations or Trials nece&s;&s;ary to prove this Hypo|the&s;is,
which are direct and po&s;itive, and may be truly call'd <HI>Experimenta
Crucis,</HI> according to the Lord <HI>Verulam</HI> are principally two, which are &s;ufficient
to prove it thoroughly, tho' the other &s;hould fail; the fir&s;t is to procure an
exact trial to be made of the Time that a Pendulum Clock will keep under or
near the Aequinoctial, which is adju&s;ted exactly to the time by the Sun or
Stars in a much greater Latitude; or the trial of &s;uch a Clock in two places
very much differing in Latitude after the Clock hath been exactly adju&s;ted in
time, to one of tho&s;e places; becau&s;e &s;uch a difference if it be found and de|termin'd
will be of &s;ufficiency to determine the proportional co-operation of
the&s;e two Powers. As for in&s;tance, this may be &s;ufficiently examin'd by a
Clock adjusted in <HI>England,</HI> and tried in the <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> if Care and Accurate|ne&s;s
be u&s;ed in both the&s;e places, which I conceive might be ea&s;ily procur'd by
the Favour and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of this Honourable Society. The &s;econd which is
a much more difficult Experiment, but yet much more po&s;itive and convincing
than any other, is the mea&s;uring of the quantity of a Degree of Latitude
upon the Earth, in two places very much differing in Latitude; the one as
near as might be towards the Pole, as upon the Ice in the <HI>Finntek Gulf,</HI> as Mon|&s;ieur
<HI>Thevenot</HI> propo&s;eth, which might be procur'd by Mr. <HI>Hevelius</HI> at <HI>Dant|zick,</HI>
or Dr. <HI>Rudbeck</HI> at <HI>Stockholm</HI> in <HI>Sweedeland,</HI> who might do it him&s;elf or
<PB N="353" REF="332">
procure it to be done at the North end of that Gulf, which would be yet bet|ter,
and by &s;ome Per&s;ons in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> or other parts nearer the <HI>Aequator.</HI>
The&s;e la&s;t trials, if accurately made, would be undeniable Proofs of this &s;up|po&s;ition,
if it &s;hould be certainly found that a Degree in the more Northern
Countries were more large than a Degree in the more Southern Climate, and
the Experiment with the Pendulum Clocks would likewi&s;e more exactly ad|ju&s;t
the true Gravity of the Earth con&s;ider'd &s;imply without the compo&s;iti|on
of the vertiginous Motion. And thus much for the fir&s;t part of the Hy|pothe&s;is,
that the Figure of the Water above the Earth is that of a prolated
Sphaeroeid who&s;e &s;horte&s;t Diameter is that of the Axis of its Rotation.</P>
<P>Next for the examination of the &s;econd Part thereof (namely, whether the
Axis of its Rotation hath and doth continually by a &s;low progre&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2dly,</HI> Of the alteration of th$ Axis of the Earths Ro|tation.</NOTE> vary its
Po&s;ition with re&s;pect to the Parts of the Earth; and if &s;o, how much, and
which way, which mu&s;t vary both the Meridian Lines of Places, and al&s;o
their particular Latitudes) it had been very de&s;ireable, if from &s;ome Monu|ments
or Records of Antiquity, &s;omewhat could have been di&s;cover'd of cer|tainty
and exactne&s;s, that by comparing that or them with accurate Ob&s;er|vations
now made, or to be made, &s;omewhat of certainty of information could
have been procur'd: But I fear we &s;hall find them all in&s;ufficient in accurate|ne&s;s
to be any ways relied upon; however, if there can be found any thing
certain and accurately done, either as to the fixing of a Meridian Line on
&s;ome Building or Structure now in being, or to the po&s;itive or certain Lati|tude
of any known place, tho' po&s;&s;ibly tho&s;e Ob&s;ervations or Con&s;tructions
were made without any Regard or Notion of &s;uch an Hypothe&s;is, yet &s;ome of
them compared with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things might give much Light to
this Inquiry. Upon this account I perus'd Mr. <HI>Graves</HI> his De&s;cription of the
great Pyramid in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> that being Fabl'd to have been built for an A&s;tro|nomical
Ob&s;ervation, as Mr. <HI>Graves</HI> al&s;o takes notice. I perus'd his Book I
&s;ay, hoping I &s;hould have found, among many other curious Ob&s;ervations be
there gives us concerning them, &s;ome Ob&s;ervations perfectly made, to find
whether it &s;tands Ea&s;t, We&s;t, North and South, or whether it varies from
that re&s;pect of its &s;ides to any other part or quarter of the World, as like|wi&s;e
how much, and which way they now &s;tand; but to my wonder, he be|ing
A&s;tronomical Profe&s;&s;or, I do not find that he had any regard at all to the
&s;ame, but &s;eems to be wholly taken up with one Inquiry, which was about
the mea&s;ure or bigne&s;s of the whole and its parts, and the other matters
mention'd, are only by the bye and accidental, which &s;hews how u&s;eful The|ories
may be for the future to &s;uch as &s;hall make Ob&s;ervations; nay, tho'
they &s;hould not be true, for that it will hint many Inquiries to be taken no|tice
of which would otherwi&s;e be not thought of at all, or at lea&s;t but little
regarded, and but &s;uperficially and negligently taken notice of. I find in|deed,
that he mentions the South and North &s;ides thereof, but not as if he
had taken any notice whether they were exactly facing the South or North,
which he might ea&s;ily have done. Nor do I find that he hath taken the ex|act
$$titude of them, which methinks had been very proper to have been
retain'd upon Record with their other De&s;cription. &lsqb;Here by the bye be|cau&s;e
it agrees with a former Conjecture, I here propo&s;ed, concerning
tho&s;e &s;tupendious Works, namely, that the Core of them was probably &s;ome
natural Rock cut and &s;haped fit to be ca&s;ed or cover'd with another &s;ort of
Stone, which was at that time much contradicted, by Affirmations, that the
whole Country and Place of their Station was nothing but Sand. Give me
me leave to take notice that Mr. <HI>Graves</HI> doth affirm, That the great Pyramid
is founded upon a natural Rock which ri&s;eth above the re&s;t of the Sand, and
that the Rooms about the &s;econd Pyramid are hewen and &s;hapen out of the
natural Rock; and I doubt not but that if they were all examin'd, they would
be found to be &s;o and nothing el&s;e, which would much alleviate the &s;tupen|dious
Labour and Work of Men that mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have been &s;uppo&s;ed to
be made u&s;e of; but this only by the bye.&rsqb; To proceed then where
I le&s;t, I &s;ay that I conceive it were very de&s;irable for the future, that tho&s;e I
have mention'd, and &s;everal other particular Ob&s;ervations, were purpo&s;ely
<PB N="354" REF="333" MS="Y">
made for that &s;uch would give a great light to judge and make a true valu|ation
of the State and Nature of places and things, which in mo&s;t De&s;crip|tions
we find altogether wanting. As among many other things I could hint,
I &s;hould be very glad to find &s;uch a De&s;cription of the Nature of the Sand of
tho&s;e Parts as would inform me whether it have not been all a Sea-Sand: I
&s;ay, not only of this Country of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> which is &s;o exceeding plain, and &s;o
exceeding Sandy, with many cragged Rocks ri&s;ing out of it; but of <HI>Arabia
De&s;erta,</HI> and <HI>Arabia Petraea,</HI> and all the parts near the <HI>Tigris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates,</HI>
and all the parts on this &s;ide of <HI>Egypt,</HI> as the Region of <HI>Barca</HI> and <HI>Pentapoli|tana,</HI>
and many other which are &s;aid to be all &s;mooth and cover'd with Sand;
for Ob&s;ervations de&s;ignedly made, would ea&s;ily di&s;cover whether &s;uch Sands
had been owing to the Sea, or to &s;ome other Cau&s;e, which, by &s;ome curious
Ob&s;ervations I have met with in the Travels of <HI>Peter de la Valle</HI> and <HI>Belloni|us,</HI>
and others, I judge they have. I &s;hall here pre&s;ent you with one of
them. <HI>Pietro della Valle parte terza Lettera</HI> 11da <HI>d' Aleppo</HI> Aug. 5. 1625.
<HI>Vidi per terra molte Conchiglie marine, lu&s;tre dentro comme Madre Perle, parte in|tere,

<P>In <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> thus, &startq;I Saw on the Ground many Sea-Shells &s;hining within like
Mother of Pearl, &s;ome whole, &s;ome broken, I much wonder'd how they
could be found in a place &s;o far di&s;tant from the Sea; I &s;aw al&s;o &s;cattered
every where many bits of Bitumen, which in this &s;alt Earth and Soil is ge|nerated
and ri&s;es upon the Water at &s;ome times of the Year, of which I

have found &s;omething remarkable to my purpo&s;e in the Voyages of Sir <HI>George
Wheeler,</HI> where he hath de&s;crib'd <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Athens</HI> in particular, and all the
remarkable places about it, which are Places the be&s;t de&s;cribed of any thing
of Antiquity, and more e&s;pecially in his De&s;cription of the Temple of the
Eight Winds, which is &s;aid by <HI>Vitruvius</HI> to be given to the City of <HI>Athens</HI> by
<HI>Andronicus Cyrrha&s;tes,</HI> and is remaining intire to this Day, all except the Vane

very exact and curious Ob&s;ervations, which methinks the very de&s;ign of the
place &s;hould have hinted, of the true Po&s;ition of it as to tho&s;e eight parts or
<HI>Plagae mundi;</HI> but I find nothing more to this purpo&s;e but that each Wind an&s;|wer'd
exactly to the compa&s;s, in the mean time not telling what was the va|riation
of that compa&s;s at that time or place; however, he doth &s;hew that
the Po&s;ition and Latitudes of places do much differ from what they had been
de&s;cribed to us, but then how far we may relie upon antient Ob&s;ervations,
will be a further doubt.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be glad that &s;uch has are better read in ancient Records would for
the future at lea&s;t take notice of any Ob&s;ervations they meet with which may
afford &s;ome light to this Inquiry; and &s;o for that Matter I mu&s;t there leave
it; for tho' I could accumulate many Ob&s;ervations which do &s;eem to make for
it, yet the uncertainty and unaccuratene&s;s of the Ob&s;ervations of the Anci|ents
in this particular make me omit them.</P>
<P>And &s;o I am reduced at la&s;t to &s;uch Ob&s;ervations as have been made in
latter times, and with more accuratene&s;s and diligence, and with better In|&s;truments,
and to what may be purpo&s;ely made with In&s;truments a hundred
times more axact, and with de&s;igned and pertinent Ob&s;ervations for this ve|ry
end; and &s;uch Ob&s;ervations will be principally of two kinds, First, Such
as examine and &s;tate the exact Po&s;ition of the Meridian Line of places even to
a &s;ingle &s;econd, or to a greater accuratene&s;s if required. And Secondly, Such as
examine and &s;tate the true Latitude for that from &s;ome few &s;uch Ob&s;ervati|ons
accurately made, as they ought, more may be proved by &s;even Years Ob|&s;ervations
than by &s;even hunder'd Years Ob&s;ervation of the Antients, nay tho'
they were again multiplied by &s;even. But of this I &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e in my next.</P>

<P>I Hoped I had by my Di&s;cour&s;e at the la&s;t meeting evidenced the first part of
my Po&s;ition which I deduced as a Corollary from the diurnal Motion of
the Earth, namely, that &s;uch a motion mu&s;t cau&s;e a rece&s;&s;ion of the Sea from
the Polar parts towards the Aequinoctial, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily make the
Surface thereof of a prolated Sphaeroidical Figure. But I perceive &s;ome not|with&s;tanding
the Experiment, which &s;hewed of the rece&s;s of the Water from
the Center, do yet doubt of the Con&s;equences thence deduced with reference
to the Earth, and &s;eem'd not to be &s;atisfied that the two Methods which I
propounded for the examination and determination thereof were &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>Now that I might not leave any rub behind which might be a &s;tumbling
Block at the entrance, I have now prepared a &s;hort demon&s;tration of the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
and infallible certainty thereof, as it is a deduction from an Hypothe&s;is
which is now by mo&s;t Philo&s;ophers and A&s;tronomers granted, namely, the
diurnal Motion of the Body of the Earth upon its Axis.</P>
<P>In order to which Demon&s;tration I mu&s;t premi&s;e this principle of Motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Body moved will pre&s;evere in that motion.</NOTE>
That <HI>every Body that hath received, or is moved with any degree of motion if it re|ceives
no other motion from any other Body what&s;oever, will con&s;tantly per&s;evere or
continue moved with the &s;ame velocity in the &s;treight Line of its tendency infinitely
produced.</HI> The rea&s;on of which is this, that no Rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned why its
Motion &s;hould cea&s;e where there can be no impediment. Nor is there any
rea&s;on why it &s;hould deflect to any &s;ide out of its direct way, &s;ince from the
&s;uppo&s;ition there can be no new motion added to it from any other Body.
Now this being a Principle will not admit of any other Demon&s;tration than
that of Induction from particular Observations in Natural Motions, by which
all &s;uch Principles are made; for who&s;oever &s;hall &s;trictly and accurately ex|amine
and analy&s;e all local Motions, will, find hundreds of in&s;tances that af|ter
a due analy&s;is is made do &s;ufficiently evidence the unier&s;ality and cer|tainty
of this Principle in all local Motions.</P>
<P>From which Principle it will follow, that any Body moved Circularly with
any degree of velocity (whil&s;t &s;ome way continu'd to move about that Center)
will at the in&s;tant that containing Power is removed, proceed to move direct|ly
forward in the &s;traight Line of its tendency, which &s;traight Line is a tan|gent
to that Circle in which it aquired, or had its impre&s;t velocity; for the
conteining Power, which by a continual atraction or otherwi&s;e towards the
Center, kept it in that Circulation, cea&s;ing, and no other Body what&s;oever
impre&s;&s;ing any new motion upon it (as is &s;uppo&s;ed in the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition) the
Body mu&s;t continue to move in the &s;treight Line of its Direction without a|ny
Deflection, Retardation, or Acceleration.</P>
<P>From hence it will follow, that the farther it is moved in that Line, the
more and more will it recede from that Center of Motion to which it was
detained, and that for a &s;hort time with Spaces in a duplicate proportion of
the times it &s;pendeth, or of the Spaces it pa&s;&s;es in that tangent Line, name|ly,
in the proportion of the &s;maller Secants. This, as &s;hewn by <HI>Gelileo</HI> and
others, I pa&s;s over without farther proof.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="335">
From hence it will follow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 8. Fig. 1.</NOTE> that in all Circular Motions that make their
Revolutions in equal times about the &s;ame Center, but in Circles of differing
Radii, the rece&s;s in equal times will always be in the &s;ame proportion as the
Radii of tho&s;e Circles, or as the Tangents or Secants of the &s;ame Angle at
the Center; this will be plain by the Scheme, where a repre&s;ents the Center
of the Motion, <HI>eg, di, cl, &amp;c.</HI> Similar Arches of different Circles on the
&s;ame Center <HI>a,</HI> the Bodies placed in <HI>b, c, d, e,</HI> are put to pa&s;s their re&s;pective
Arches <HI>bn, cl, di, eg,</HI> all in the &s;ame time; now the Tangents <HI>ef, dh, ck,</HI>
bm being in the &s;ame proportion with their re&s;pective Radii, and their re|&s;pective
Secants, their re&s;pective receding from the Center <HI>a,</HI> will be in
proportion to their Radii.</P>
<P>Hence it follows, that the rece&s;s of the Parts of the Earth from the Axis
of the diurnal Rotation will be in the &s;ame proportion as the Sines comple|ment
of the Latitude of tho&s;e places, which rece&s;s is no where directly from
the Center of Gravity, but under the Aequinoctial it being every where per|pendicular
to the Axis of Rotation.</P>
<P>Now the &s;imple Gravity of the Earth as a Globous Body at re&s;t can be no o|ther
than to the Center of that Globe, it being con&s;ider'd only as a Globe with|out
any Circular Motion, as I &s;hall prove when I &s;peak of Gravity. And this
Gravity every way equal, it will thence nece&s;&s;arily follow, that by the com|po&s;ition
of tho&s;e two Powers acting on Bodies, there will nece&s;&s;arily follow
the&s;e Con&s;equences, First, That every Meridian Line upon the Surface of
the Sea, is of an Elliptical Figure, who&s;e &s;horte&s;t Diameter is in the Pole,
and who&s;e longe&s;t is in the Plain of the Aequinoctial. Secondly, That the
Gravitation of the Earth, as moved on an Axis, is in every Latitude different,
the lea&s;t under the Aequator and the greate&s;t under the Poles.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Demon&s;tration of the Figure of the Earth. Tab. 8. Fig. 2.</NOTE> That the Perpendiculars or Lines of Gravity or De&s;cent do no
where, except under the Poles and Aequinoctial re&s;pect the Center of the
Earth; but other Centers in the Axis of its Rotation, let <HI>Abc,</HI> repre&s;ent a
quarter of the terre&s;tial Globe Orthographically projected upon the plain of
a Meridian, where let a, repre&s;ent the Center, <HI>b,</HI> the Pole, <HI>ab,</HI> the Axis, ac,
the Aequinoctial, let <HI><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></HI> repre&s;ent the Radii of certain parallels of Lati|tude,
who&s;e Rotation about the Axis <HI>ab,</HI> gives each of them a proportion
of velocity corre&s;ponding to their length or di&s;tance from their Axis of
Motion <HI>ab,</HI> that is in proportion to the Sine complement of the Latitude of
the place or parallel. Let <HI>c, g, b, r, n, y,</HI> repre&s;ent a very thin Superficies of
the Globe of the Earth or Sea; let <HI>ac, ae, ag, ai, ab,</HI> repre&s;ent the natu|ral
Lines or Rays of Gravity tending to the Center of the Earth all of equal
length and equal power as to Gravity. The parts then in the Figure being
under&s;tood, I proceed to the Expo&s;ition of the Doctrine, let <HI>g,</HI> then repre|&s;ent
a Body &s;omewhere placed upon the Superficies of the Earth; I &s;ay, this
Body will be affected or moved with a double Power: First, By a Power gra|vitating
towards the Center <HI>a,</HI> which is the &s;ame where ever the Body be plac|ed;
this gives it a power of de&s;cending from <HI>g,</HI> to <HI>n,</HI> in a certain &s;pace
of time. Secondly, by a levitating power in the Line <HI><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> g,</HI> whereby in the
&s;ame &s;pace of time it would a&s;cend from the Center of its motion <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, from <HI>g,</HI>
to <HI>h.</HI> Now draw, <HI>no,</HI> parallel and equal to, <HI>gh,</HI> and draw, <HI>og,</HI> and <HI>oh.</HI> Now
becau&s;e in both the&s;e Motions the acceleration is in duplicate proportion of
the times it &s;pendeth in pa&s;&s;ing them, it follows, that the Motion compo&s;ed
of both tho&s;e Motions &s;hall be made in a &s;traight Line, namely, in the Di|agonal
Line <HI>go,</HI> for <HI>g,</HI> being by Gravity carried ton, and by Levity, as a|fore&s;aid,
removed from <HI>n,</HI> to <HI>o,</HI> the place of the Body <HI>g,</HI> at the end of that
time, &s;hall be found <HI>o.</HI> The &s;ame Demon&s;tration will &s;erve for <HI>c, e, i,</HI> and <HI>b,
Mutatis Mutandis;</HI> whence it follows nece&s;&s;arily, that the Lines of De&s;cent of
&s;uch a Body are not to the Center of the Earth at <HI>a,</HI> but to &s;ome other
point of the Axis of Motion, as <HI>t, v, &amp;c.</HI> Secondly, The Figure of the
Water will be Oval, or truly Elliptical, as <HI>x m, o, q, r,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>xy, ml, on,
qp, &amp;c.</HI> are all proportioned to their re&s;pective Radii. Thirdly, The power
of this compounded Motion will affect all Bodies in differing Latitudes with dif|fering
Gravity, which were the proprieties to be proved.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="336">
From which demon&s;tration it plainly appears, that the Con&s;equences I
have deduc'd from the Hypothe&s;is of the diurnal Rotation of the Earth are
nece&s;&s;ary, and cannot, according to the Laws of Motion, be otherwise than
what I have deduc'd, not frivolous Suppo&s;itions taken up at random to &s;olve
one Phaenomenon, but &s;uch as will give light to many other con&s;iderable ef|fects
of Nature, as I &s;hall demon&s;trate in explaining &s;everal other Phaenomena
both of the Earth and of the Heavens.</P>
<P>It further appears al&s;o, that the Experiments or <HI>Criteria</HI> I have propound|ed,
are both pertinent and &s;ufficient to determine and &s;tate this Enquiry
without any other, and that they are neither impo&s;&s;ible nor very difficult to
be procur'd to be try'd with accuratene&s;s enough.</P>
<P>Now as the&s;e may ea&s;ily enough be procur'd by the mediation of this Ho|nourable
Society; &s;o I doubt not but they may, with little more trouble, pro|cure
&s;uch Ob&s;ervations and Experiments to be made as would afford great
Light towards the perfecting &s;everal other parts of u&s;eful Knowledge, &s;ome
few of which, if judiciou&s;ly and pertinently contriv'd &s;o as to be plain and
ea&s;y, would give us the determination of many old, yea, and many new The|ories
po&s;&s;ibly not hitherto thought of, &s;ome of which I &s;hall hereafter have
occa&s;ion to mention. Such ob&s;ervations will be worthy the Care of this So|ciety,
and will be better than accidental and ca&s;ual Trials, which, tho'
&s;urpri&s;ing and plea&s;ant, are at be&s;t but like tho&s;e of the &s;eekers of the Philo|&s;ophers
Stone and perpetual Motion, who generally make trials at a venture,
to &s;ee if there good Genius or Fortune will direct them to meet with what
they &s;eek; whereas indeed all Experiments ought to be directed to &s;ome end
for the examination of &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed Truth, and for that end to take notice
of all &s;uch Circum&s;tances as may give any information concerning it, whether
it be for Confirmation, or Confutation of &s;uch a Doctrine, and if &s;o, the
plainer and the more obvious the Experiments are, the better.</P>
<P>If yet there &s;hall remain any doubt either in the deduction of this Con|clu&s;ion,
or the &s;ufficiency of the Experiments to determine and &s;tate the truth
thereof, I would very willingly explain any part thereof.</P>
<P>The next part of my Hypothe&s;is is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Method of determining whether the Axis of the Earths Rotati|on alters.</NOTE> that by many Ob&s;ervations I conceive
that there may be in the Rotation of the Body of the Earth, a change of the
Axis of that Rotation, by a certain &s;low Progre&s;&s;ive Motion thereof, where|by
the Poles of the &s;aid Motion appear to be in &s;uperficial parts of the Earth,
which heretofore were at &s;ome di&s;tance from the then polar Points or Parts.
I have waved all the Ob&s;ervations that I have hitherto met with in Hi&s;to|ries
which might &s;eem to favour this Hypothe&s;is, as having found them irre|gular
and unaccurate enough in Ob&s;ervations of this kind, and have put the
whole &s;tre&s;s of its Proof, or rather Examination, upon trials to be made for
the future. But becau&s;e this Motion, if any, &s;eems to be very &s;mall and &s;low,
and therefore &s;ince the Age of Man, which is very &s;hort comparatively, &s;eems
in&s;ufficient for &s;uch a purpo&s;e; I have therefore indeavour'd to carry Maho|met
to the Mountain, &s;ince I cannot bring the Mountain to Mahomet, and
that is by contriving &s;uch ways as may perform that in a &s;hort time, which,
by the Methods of the Antients, could not be perform'd in le&s;s than &s;ome
Ages. This Contrivance con&s;i&s;ts only in the exactne&s;s of In&s;truments, and
the accuratene&s;s of making Ob&s;ervations; for if for in&s;tance we are not &s;ure
of the truth of the Latitudes of places recorded by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> to
a degree or two, as I can &s;hew hundreds of places that differ more than that
from the Truth; and if by any new Method we may be able to make Ob|&s;ervations
either of the Latitude of a Place, or of the true Meridian of
any &s;uch place to a &s;ingle &s;econd Minute, than we may by &s;uch a means ar|rive
to a certainty in a three thou&s;and &s;ix hundred part of the time that could
be arriv'd at by &s;uch Ob&s;ervations as theirs are; wherein their Defects lay
whether in their In&s;truments, or their way of u&s;ing them, or their negli|gence
in computing, or the want of our pre&s;ent arithmeticial Art, and of pro|per
and accurate Tables, or in the Doctrine and Practi&s;e of plain and Sphae|rical
Trigonometry, I do not inquire; but certain it is, we have at pre&s;ent
a great advantage of them in all the&s;e particulars, but above all, mo&s;t emi|nently
by the Knowledge and U&s;e of Optick Gla&s;&s;es, e&s;pecially as they are
<PB N="358" REF="337">
applied to Mathematical In&s;truments, for by them only we are truly made
Gygantick, and our Eye from the little Ball of le&s;s than an Inch in Diame|ter
is grown to be of fifty, &s;ixty, nay a hundred Foot and more in Diame|ter,
and may be made able to do &s;ome thou&s;ands of times more than what
our bare Eye alone without the u&s;e of &s;uch helps can perform; and there|fore
tho' <HI>Hevelius</HI> might have &s;ome rea&s;on to be unea&s;y, and &s;o to rail at me
for a&s;&s;erting of this Truth to the World after he had publi&s;h'd his <HI>Machina
Caele&s;tis</HI> to &s;hew he had made u&s;e of the be&s;t In&s;truments in the World for his
Ob&s;ervation; yet why Dr. <HI>Wallis</HI> and his Adherents, &s;ome of which have
made u&s;e of the very Contrivances which I Publi&s;h'd, &s;hould with &s;o much
Gall write again&s;t me for it, I cannot but wonder: But I doubt not but to
prove to all the World in my own Vindication, that neither the one nor the
other had any rea&s;on but ill Will for what they did, and at the &s;ame time to
prove the truth of every particular which I have a&s;&s;erted in that Book to a|ny
that will believe his own Eyes; but not to trouble you any further with
this Controver&s;y at pre&s;ent, de&s;igning &s;uddainly to publi&s;h my An&s;wers to
them where they may be &s;een more at large, I &s;hall proceed to the Methods
of making Ob&s;ervations both of the Meridian Line of any place, and al&s;o of
its true Latitude in re&s;pect of the Heavens to the accuratene&s;s of a &s;ingle
Second.</P>
<P>And here only I have one or two Po&s;tulata to premi&s;e, which I &s;uppo&s;e e|very
one that hears it will readily grant; it is no more but the&s;e; First,
That it is po&s;&s;ible, nay, practicable, to find a Point below perpendicular, to a
a Point above, tho' the di&s;tance between them be a hundred Foot, and to
be certain of the truth thereof to the exactne&s;s of a Second Minute.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the Refraction of the Air at &s;ixty Degrees Altitude above
the Horizon does not at vary the Azymuth of a Body a &s;ingle Second Minute.</P>
<P>A Third Truth I will put by way of a Po&s;talutum, that 'tis po&s;&s;ible, nay, easi|ly
practicable to di&s;tingui&s;h the parts of a far remov'd Object by the help of
Tele&s;copes long enough, tho' they really appear to the Object Gla&s;s of that
Tele&s;cope le&s;s than that of a &s;ingle Second Minute.</P>
<P>The&s;e I conceive &s;o ea&s;y and certain, that I have put them as <HI>Po&s;tulata;</HI>
but yet If any doubt of their certainty, I do undertake to prove the Truth of
either of them both by Experiment or Demon&s;tration, which of the two &s;hall
be judg'd mo&s;t convincing.</P>
<P>The next thing to be &s;hewn is how to order a Tele&s;cope &s;o that it may be
made a &s;ight, that the true Line in which the Object appears may be certain|ly
determin'd, and this, be the Tele&s;cope &s;ixty or a hundred Foot or more in
length, and how to make by this, an In&s;trument as large as the &s;aid Tele|&s;cope
is a &s;ight.</P>
<P>For the performance of the&s;e Qualifications there will be no greater difficul|ty,
than the making a Tube for &s;uch a Tele&s;cope, or, if that be thought
too much, it may be done by two &s;mall Scaffold Poles joyned together in the
middle with convenient Lines to keep them &s;treight, or if this be &s;till
thought too difficult, it may be done by fitting the Object Gla&s;s in one Cell,
and the Eye Gla&s;s and Thread-&s;ights in another, with Lines &s;trained between
them to keep them directly parallel to each other; but the be&s;t way is by a
Tele&s;cope Tube of a due length and higne&s;s for the Object-gla&s;s made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing then a Tele&s;cope of &s;ixty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Instruments for that purpo&s;e.</NOTE> eighty, or a hundred Foot in length
thus fitted with a Tube, to find the true Line of Direction, I fa&s;ten to the
Cell that holds the Object Gla&s;s a Needle with the point outwards again&s;t the
middle of the Gla&s;s. And the like I al&s;o fix in a &s;mall &s;liding Plate, that lieth
upon the Cell, that holdeth the Thread-&s;ight together with the Eye-gla&s;s:
This Plate, by a very fine Screw, I can cau&s;e to &s;lip out or in at plea&s;ure, till
it be adju&s;ted to a Line from the point of the Needle fa&s;ten'd to the Cell of
the Object-gla&s;s: To adju&s;t this Tele&s;cope then for a &s;ight, I direct it to &s;ome
very remote Object in the Horizon, and fix a Pin or Wire ju&s;t touching the
point of the Needle at the Object-gla&s;s; then having found and remarked
&s;ome convenient Point of the Object in the Horizon, I move the Tube till the
Thread of the &s;ight exactly lie upon it; then inverting or turning the Tube,
making the under &s;ide upermo&s;t, and the uper &s;ide undermo&s;t, the right the
<PB N="359" REF="338">
left and the left the rights; I cau&s;e the point of the Object-gla&s;s Needle, as al&s;o,
that of the Cell of the Threads to touch the &s;ame Points as before inver&s;ion,
then looking at the point of the Horizontal Object, I &s;ee whether the a|fore-&s;aid
Line of it do cover the &s;ame part of the Object as it did before in|ver&s;ion.
If it happen &s;o to do, then I am certain that the Tele&s;cope is al|ready
adju&s;ted; but if it do not, it will be adju&s;ted by moving the &s;liding
Plate with the Needle at the Eye-cell: When thus adju&s;ted, the&s;e two
Needles points become the Indexes to my In&s;trument, for exactly taking the
vi&s;ual Line of the Object, I ob&s;erve to as great accuratene&s;s as is de&s;ired.
Having thus prepar'd the &s;ight for my In&s;trument, I make choice of &s;ome
Tower of a convenient height for the re&s;ting the end of the Tube that holdeth
the Object-gla&s;s, and order it &s;o that the Needles point may touch a fixed
point upon the &s;ame; then I make a Board below upon the Ground lying
Horizontal, whereupon the other end of the Tube may be &s;lid Horizontal
and ea&s;ily remov'd at plea&s;ure. The Object I make choice of is the Pole|&s;tar,
or the Star in the tail of the le&s;&s;er bear. I by this means ob&s;erve its
mo&s;t Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern Excur&s;ion the &s;ame Night; or if it happen that one
is in the Night and the other in the Day, by means of this Tele&s;cope I can
plainly &s;ee it, tho' the Sun &s;hine. Now the Needles point at the Object-gla&s;s
touching in both Excur&s;ions, and the Needles point at the Eye-&s;ight
&s;hewing the two Azymuthes of the &s;aid Excur&s;ions, wherein the Refractions
can have no effect to make the Ray bent, it will be ea&s;y enough accurately
to divide the &s;pace between the two Excur&s;ions into half, and as ea&s;y to fine
the Point below perpendicular under the Point above marked by the Needles
Point of the Object-gla&s;s, or which for this purpo&s;e will be better to find a
point above upon &s;ome building of equal height with that of the Object-gla&s;s,
by which two Points I direct my Tele&s;cope to the Horizon either North|wards
or Southwards, and find what Object lies directly in the Meridian
Line, which I diligently note and draw the Land&s;cape of that part of the
Horizon which appears through the Gla&s;s when &s;o po&s;ited with the very
point of the &s;ame cover'd by the Thread-&s;ight; which done, I continue the
&s;aid Land&s;cape by the help of the Tele&s;cope till I bring in &s;ome remarkable
known Object, by means of which I &s;hall be able a Year or two after to find
the &s;ame again, when the &s;ame trial is again to be repeated with the &s;ame
care. In order to determine this Que&s;tion, whether the Meridian Line up|on
the Surface of the Earth do change; by which means if it be alter'd but
a Second or two, I shall be able to di&s;tingui&s;h it in the Horizontal Land&s;cape.
Now tho' this Experiment upon the whole Matter may &s;eem trouble&s;ome
and difficult to be perform'd duely as it ought, yet if we con&s;ider the Impor|tance
thereof in this Matter, and how much can be done by the Care of one
Man in a &s;hort &s;pace, which by the Method of the Antients was to not be ex|pected
from the performances of any one or many under the expectation of
&s;ome Ages, I conceive the Experiment may be look'd upon in the whole as
compendious, cheap and ea&s;y; there being nothing therein &s;o difficult bus
that two Men may every day, for &s;ome days together, repeat the Ob&s;ervati|ons
and Trials after the apparatus is made ready and put in order, and need
not &s;pend above four Hours in twenty four to make them &s;ufficiently
accurate.</P>
<P>Nor will it be very difficult in this City to find a convenient Building or
Tower for the re&s;ting the end of the Tele&s;cope of a hundred Foot long if it
be made u&s;e of; or of finding a good pro&s;pect of a far di&s;tant Meridional Ob|ject
in the Horizon, whether towards the North or South, they being both or
either equally &s;ufficient for this Ob&s;ervation: And if a fifty or &s;ixty Foot Te|le&s;cope
be made u&s;e of, which will be able to perform the Ob&s;ervation accu|rately
enough, with a little more Care and Circum&s;pection, tho' with le&s;s
Labour, and Pains, and Charge, there are Hou&s;es enough to be found of &s;uf|ficient
height.</P>
<P>Now this Experiment I conceive &s;ufficient to perform what is de&s;ign'd, or
to be expected from it, as to this Inquiry, and all things con&s;ider'd, I con|ceive
the be&s;t, tho' I could produce &s;ome others if there be occa&s;ion; and
further, I conceive the &s;ame to be free from all material Objections: As
<PB N="360" REF="339">
Fir&s;t; If it be Objected, that the Refraction of the Air doth make the Caere|&s;tial
Objects to appear out of their true places. I &s;ay, that in this Experi|ment
it can have no effect, becau&s;e the Azymuth and Circle of Po&s;ition only
are &s;ought and tho&s;e the Refraction of the Air alters not; for the Star be|ing
only to be ob&s;erv'd when it it is either a&s;cending in its mo&s;t Ea&s;tern Azy|muth,
or de&s;cending in its mo&s;t&punc; We&s;tern Azymuth, the effect of any would
be the &s;ame, &s;ince they are &s;o found and ob&s;erv'd at the &s;ame Altitude both
a&s;cending and de&s;cending; and tho' the Refraction &s;hould rai&s;e them, and
the whole Circle, and the &s;aid Star to a &s;en&s;ible higher Po&s;ition than the Truth,
yet the Points to be ob&s;erv'd being both of equal Altitude, the effect will be
the &s;ame, which will no way di&s;turb this Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Next if it be Objected, that this Star doth alter its di&s;tance from the Pole|&s;tar
every Year, and that will make the Excur&s;ions le&s;s in the &s;ucceeding
Year. I &s;ay, as to this Inquiry, it would have no effect, tho' it &s;hould alter
ten times more, becau&s;e the middle between the Excur&s;ions in the &s;ame day,
is that which is &s;ought in this Experiment.</P>
<P>If the parallax of the Earths Orb be Objected, which is the mo&s;t material, I
An&s;wer, That the &s;ucceeding Experiments are to be try'd again when the
Earth is in the &s;ame part of the Ecliptick, which will fully an&s;wer any Scru|ple
thence.</P>
<P>And, upon the whole, I cannot think of any other,; but if any of this
Honourable Society can think of any Material, I would de&s;ire to be inform'd
of them, that I may think of &s;ome means of remedying them; or if they think
of any other more convenient and certain, that I may put them in practi&s;e.
Some other of my own I &s;hall propound the next Day and leave them to the
Judgment of the Society to chu&s;e the most fit.</P>
<P>This, I hope, may &s;ave the Labour of &s;earching into Records of Antiqui|ty,
of all which if I may be allow'd to judge by tho&s;e I have met with, I be|lieve
they will at be&s;t afford us but uncertain and unaccurate Ob&s;ervations,
and I do very much doubt whether ever there were above two thou&s;and Years
&s;ince, any Meridian truly &s;et to the certainty of le&s;s than one Degree; &s;o
that tho' we had found by the great Pyramid, that there was either &s;ome con|&s;iderable
variety from the pre&s;ent Meridian, or that it were now in the very
Meridian Line, the Conclusions drawn from either of them would have been
but conjectural, &s;ince it might have been placed true, and have &s;ince varied,
as it is found, or it might have been placed wrong, and since have mov'd to
a Truth, or the contrary.</P>
<P>Whereas, &s;ince by this Experiment, we may be able to find the Meridian
true to the three thou&s;and &s;ix hundred part of a Degree, and the&s;e Ob&s;ervations
may be made by one and the &s;ame Man, and with the &s;ame In&s;trument in the
&s;ame place, and at the &s;ame time of the Year, and of the Day; I conceive that
one Years Ob&s;ervation will more a&s;certain us in this particular, than it we
had Records of Ob&s;ervations made, as tho&s;e I have met with 3600 Years
&s;ince, which is the Expedient I have thought of for redeeming or expanding
the power of the &s;hort Line of the Life of a Man.</P>
<P>Other Methods of determining the &s;ame Que&s;tion, read<HI>Feb.</HI> 16. 168$.</P>
<P>In order to determine whether the Meridional Line of Places did alter, I
did in my la&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e wave all antient Ob&s;ervations, as fearing there might
be wanting in them that certainty and accuratene&s;s of Ob&s;ervations that
might be &s;ufficient to a&s;&s;ure us of the Matter of Fact, and that might be
convincing as to the Reality or Nullity of &s;uch an alteration, as I &s;uppos'd.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e po&s;&s;ibly there may be &s;ome Ob&s;ervations of a latter date which
have been here made within our pre&s;ent reach,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1 &s;t.</HI> By ancient Buildings.</NOTE> which are of more accu|ratene&s;s,
I would propound it a thing not unfit to be examin'd, whether the
Po&s;ition of &s;everal of the mo&s;t eminent Cathedrals built by the <HI>Gothick.</HI> Arch|itecture,
wherein great regard, if not Religion, &s;eems to have been had of
the Po&s;ition of them, according to the four quarters of the Horizon, <HI>viz.</HI>
E, W, N, and S. And to this end, becau&s;e neare&s;t this place, I could wi&s;h
<PB N="361" REF="340">
it were tried at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Abby,</HI> which is intirely built after that Mode;
whether that be truly &s;o plac'd that the four Ends or Fronts thereof do ex|actly
face tho&s;e Quarters, and if not, which way the variation may be, and
how much it really is at this pre&s;ent. The &s;ame Ob&s;ervation may be pro|cur'd
to be made at &s;everal other Cathedrals, as at <HI>Salisbury, Winche&s;ter, Chi|che&s;ter,
York,</HI> &amp;c. where there are &s;uch Buildings, which will be with no great
difficulty procur'd by the Mediation of this Society.</P>
<P>Among other places worth examining, I could wi&s;h that the great Dial|&s;tone
in the Privy Garden at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> were one, for that I conceive
there was very great Care and Accuratene&s;s u&s;ed in the placing thereof; and
tho' this may &s;eem, if compar'd with others of a very &s;hort continuance &s;ince
its fir&s;t placing, yet it may be with probability enough &s;uppos'd to have been
&s;o much more accurately plac'd, that That alone may po&s;&s;ibly make it prefer|able
to any other whether Ancient or Modern.</P>
<P>Now becau&s;e the ways publi&s;h'd for finding the true Meridian Line have
really much of difficulty in them, and require both a great Apparatus and a
considerable time to make the Ob&s;ervations nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e, with|out
which the Informations and Examinations will be very unaccurate and
&s;carce to be rely'd upon, therefore I have contriv'd an In&s;trument by which,
in a few Minutes of Time, the exact Meridian Line, at any place, may be
ea&s;ily and with accuratene&s;s enough, that is, to ten Seconds, if need require;
and this free from Exceptions of Refraction, Declination, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which the
true Po&s;ition of any Building, Monument, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be pre&s;ently di&s;cover'd
and computed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t In&s;trument from this purpo&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2dly.</HI> By fit in&s;truments.</NOTE> is a Tele&s;cope of what length &s;hall
be thought convenient to be ea&s;ily u&s;ed and manag'd; as &s;uppo&s;e one of &s;ix,
twelve, or fifteen Foot, this mu&s;t in the fir&s;t place be fitted with Eye-&s;ights,
plac'd upon a thin piece of Looking-gla&s;s Plate, on which mu&s;t be drawn
with a very fine Diamant, &s;uch Lines and Circles as I &s;hall direct, the Center
of all which Circles is to repre&s;ent the true Polar Point in the Heavens, at the
time of the Ob&s;ervation of which more by and by.</P>
<P>This Sight-gla&s;s being fix'd in the Tube, the next thing to be done is to
&s;ix two pieces of Bra&s;&s;, or &s;ome other convenient Metal, which may have
each of them a &s;mall hole to hold a &s;mall clew of Silk fit to bear a Plumbet
or &s;uch other In&s;trument as I &s;hall direct; the&s;e holes mu&s;t be &s;o place'd as
that an imaginary Line drawn over the ends of them may be exactly parallel
to the Axis of the Tele&s;cope which pa&s;&s;eth through the Center of the Sight-gla&s;s.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Into the&s;e holes mu&s;t be fitted &s;mall Silken Lines with Plumbets
hanging at them, which two Plumb-Lines will (when the Axis of the Tele|&s;cope
pa&s;&s;ing through the Center of the Sight-plate is directed to the Polar
Point) hang in the plain of the Meridian.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The Axis of the Tele&s;cope may be ea&s;ily directed to the Polar
Point, by bringing three or more Stars of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ro&s;e into their proper
Circles and there fixing it.</P>
<P>Fifthly, The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ro&s;e is a Con&s;tellation in the Heavens di&s;coverable on|ly
by a Tele&s;cope, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix Stars in the Ro&s;e it&s;elf, and &s;everal o|ther
in the Leaves and Branches, one of the&s;e is in the Center of the Ro&s;e,
and five in the five green Leaves of the Knob: This I have &s;omewhere de|&s;crib'd
about ten Years &s;ince, but have mi&s;laid them at pre&s;ent; the way of
finding them I then &s;hew'd to Sir <HI>Chr. Wren,</HI> and &s;ome others of this Society at
the time when my In&s;trument was fixed for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The In&s;trument or Tele&s;cope being fix'd in this Po&s;ition, the two Plumb|holes
repre&s;ent the true Axis of the Earth, and accordingly will &s;erve to de|termine
both the plain of the Meridian, and al&s;o the inclination of the Axis
to the plain of the Horizon; &s;o that by the &s;ame Ob&s;ervation both the Me|ridian
Line may be determin'd, and al&s;o the elevation of the Polar Point,
<PB N="362" REF="341">
which may be various ways mo&s;t exactly mea&s;ur'd and determin'd. Now this
is a &s;econd way of determining the true Meridian Line to what accuratene&s;s
&s;hall be de&s;ir'd, for that the length of the Tele&s;cope is not limited, but may
be us'd of what length &s;oever may be made, tho' it may be three hundred or
four hundred Foot, for that the Object-gla&s;s may be fix'd at the top of &s;ome
Tower or Steeple, and the Sights and Eye-gla&s;s at the Ground. But on this
I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent inlarge, beeau&s;e, whenever there &s;hall be occa&s;ion of
trial, I can ea&s;ily direct the whole Apparatus.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd U&s;e thereof, which is for taking the Altitude of the Po|lar
Point above the Horizon; this way is far beyond any I have met with,
and is liable to one only Objection (as I conceive) and that is the Refraction
of the Air, which elevates the &s;ame &s;omewhat beyond its due Limits, but
then if compar'd with the be&s;t yet propos'd, I conceive it to be le&s;s &s;ubject
than any other, and to come nearer to a certainty and exactne&s;s: How|ever
I grant it to have that Objection good again&s;t it; but if we con&s;ider
the u&s;e of this Ob&s;ervation as it is de&s;ign'd to examine the Latitude of one
and the &s;ame place after the interval of &s;ome few Years, the Objection is
of no validity, for that the Refraction of the Air at the height proper for
<HI>London,</HI> viz. 51, 32, is hardly &s;en&s;ible; but then the difference between the
Refraction of the fir&s;t and &s;econd Ob&s;ervation is yet much le&s;s discoverable,
&s;o that for this purpo&s;e 'tis as effectual as the best.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e &s;ome may yet further de&s;ire to free the Ob&s;ervation from Re|fraction,
I have contriv'd another way, much le&s;s &s;ubject to it; which way
will al&s;o find the true Meridian Line to great exactne&s;s: Not to make any long
preamble to it 'tis this, Make choice of &s;ome notable fix'd Star that pa&s;&s;eth
over or near the Zenith of the place, as here, for <HI>London</HI> the <HI>Lucida Dra|conis,</HI>
or the la&s;t Star in the tail of the great Bear; 'tis ea&s;y, by the way I have
already publi&s;h'd in Print to find the Zenith, and the Meridian Line pa&s;&s;ing
through it.</P>
<P>Having fix'd all things requi&s;ite for this, about an Hour or two before the
Star comes to the Zenith or Meridian near it, find and ob&s;erve exactly its
bearing, which may be done with a Tele&s;cope of fifty, &s;ixty, or more Feet in
length, then by an exact Pendulum Clock number how many Seconds or half
Seconds of Time pa&s;s before it arrive at the Meridian, which note and remember,
then prepare to ob&s;erve the place of the &s;ame Star after &s;o many Minutes,
Seconds, and half Seconds have pa&s;s'd, after the Star hath pa&s;s'd the Meri|dian,
note the Point al&s;o. There are then given three Points, which, with
the help of Calculation, the time being taken, it will give the Latitude of
the place to a great exactne&s;s; and if a Line be drawn from the mo&s;t Ea&s;tern
to the mo&s;t We&s;tern Ob&s;ervation, this will give the true E, and W, line;
and if the &s;ame be divided in half and through the &s;ame, and the Meridional
place of the &s;aid Star, a &s;traight Line be drawn, this will give the true Me|ridian
Line.</P>
<P>So much for the methods of ob&s;erving the Latitudes and Meridian Lines
of places for the time to come.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e there have been &s;ome of our later Observations of the Lati|tudes
of &s;ome places which have been with very great Care and Accurate|ne&s;s
made; I could likewi&s;e wi&s;h that the Latitudes of tho&s;e places where they
have been &s;o made, might be a new examin'd, to &s;ee whether any con&s;i|derable
difference can be found which cannot well be a&s;crib'd to the defect
of the preceding Ob&s;ervations. As the Latitude of <HI>&V;raniburg, London, Paris,
Rome, Bolonia,</HI> &amp;c. tho' yet I fear we &s;hall be apt to a&s;cribe what difference
&s;hall be found to the faileur of the preceding Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>This is all I have at pre&s;ent to propound concerning the external Figure
of the Water and Earth. As to the motions thereof I &s;hall propound &s;ome
Conjectures after I have con&s;ider'd the Figure and Con&s;titution of the next
great Fluid in compa&s;&s;ing the Earth, which is the Air; after which I &s;hall
propound &s;ome Conjectures at the various internal motions of tho&s;e great
Fluids, which concern the Currents and Tides in the one, and the Winds in the other.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>I Have in my former Lectures propounded my Thoughts, and the Rea&s;ons
of them concerning the Figure of the Body of the Earth, and the ten|dency
of the Perpendicular Lines of Gravitation; as al&s;o concerning the
probability of a variation of the Axis of Rotation in the Body of the Earth.
I have likewi&s;e &s;hew'd the influence of tho&s;e Principles upon which I ground|ed
tho&s;e Thoughts, upon the Body of the Waters incompa&s;&s;ing this Earth|ly
Body.</P>
<P>I come in the next place to con&s;ider the Figure of the next great fluid Bo|dy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three known properties of the Air pre|mised.</NOTE>
incompa&s;&s;ing both the one and the other, and that is the Atmo&s;phere or
Ma&s;s of Air.</P>
<P>And here for the pre&s;ent I &s;hall only con&s;ider &s;o much of the Nature and
Con&s;titution of this Body, as &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to the explication of the Fi|gure
thereof.</P>
<P>It is now very well known, that this Body is of &s;uch a Con&s;titution, that a
greater degree of Heat, or a le&s;&s;er degree of Pre&s;&s;ure will effect a greater de|gree
of Expan&s;ion, that is, will cau&s;e the &s;ame parcel of Air to occupy or
fill a larger &s;pace of rome; next that the &s;ame parcel of Air, when rarify'd,
will weigh no more than when condens'd, tho' it fill a greater &s;pace, becau&s;e
the real quantity of the parts that compo&s;e this Air, are &s;till the &s;ame, tho'
there may be a greater quantity of other matter that fill the Inter&s;titia or
Spaces between them.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That the Atmo&s;phere is compos'd of three kinds of Sub&s;tances,
one more fluid than the other, two of which, namely, the le&s;s fluid Cau&s;e
con&s;iderable effects upon the &s;ubjacent parts of them&s;elves, and upon other
Aqueous and Terre&s;tial Bodies by their Weight or Gravitation. The&s;e I only
name at pre&s;ent, de&s;igning more fully to explain them and their Cau&s;es when
I di&s;cour&s;e of the Sub&s;tance and Con&s;titution of the Air.</P>
<P>The&s;e three things then for the pre&s;ent being taken as Suppositions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Atmo&s;phere under the Ae|quator higher.</NOTE> and
the tendency of the Lines of Gravitation, being, as I have prov'd, to differ|ing
and various Centers, it follows that the Figure of the two lower parts
of the Air mu&s;t be of a prolated Sphaeroidical Figure, and that much more
con&s;iderably differing from that of a Sphaerical Form than that of the Earth
or Water.</P>
<P>For Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1 &s;t.</HI> From its &s;wifter motion</NOTE> It is very evident, that the more gro&s;s Parts thereof are car|ry'd
along with the &s;ubjacent Parts of the Earth, with an almo&s;t equal
&s;wiftne&s;s; &s;ay almo&s;t, becau&s;e in the wide and open Ocean there is &s;ome
kind of lo&s;s of &s;wiftne&s;s and lagging behind, which, as I conceive, (as
<HI>Galileo</HI> and many others have done) is the Cau&s;e and Original of the Ea&s;t|wardly
Winds within or near the Tropicks; from this Rotation then will fol|low
a con&s;iderable levitation of &s;uch parts of the Air as are whirl'd round
from We&s;t to Ea&s;t with &s;uch a Rotation; that is, tho&s;e parts which are
mov'd &s;wifte&s;t will have the greate&s;t indeavour of Rece&s;s from the Axis of

<P><PB N="364" REF="343">
Next it is evident from the &s;pringy nature of the Air,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2ly.</HI> From its &s;pringy Nature.</NOTE> that the le&s;s the
pre&s;&s;ing is upon the Body thereof, the more will it expand and &s;tretch it
&s;elf and po&s;&s;e&s;s a greater &s;pace. Now the quantity of Air towards the Aequi|noctial,
having a greater Levitation upwards, or le&s;s Gravitation towards
the Earth, a greater quantity of the Air mu&s;t go to make up the Cylinder
that gives an equal Pre&s;&s;ure, and con&s;equently the Surface or Extent of the
Air towards the Aequinoctial mu&s;t upon this account be much higher than to|wards
the Poles.</P>
<P>But in the Third place this Oval Figure of the Air mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be in|creas'd
by the differing Degrees of Heat and Cold;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>3dly.</HI> From its greater heat there.</NOTE> for that a greater De|gree
of Heat doth expand, and of Cold doth conden&s;e the Body thereof.
Now it is evident that the Degrees of Heat near the Aequinoctial are very
great in compari&s;on to what they are near the Poles.</P>
<P>And con&s;equently, upon this account, al&s;o the Body of the Air towards the
Aequator, mu&s;t be very high and rarify'd, and the Body of it towards the
Poles mu&s;t be very low and condens'd; from which two Cau&s;es it will nece&s;|&s;arily
follow, that the Figure of the Body or Ma&s;s of Air, incompa&s;&s;ing the
Body of the Earth and Water, mu&s;t be of a prolated Sphaeroidical Figure,
much more prolated towards the Aequator than that of the Water.</P>
<P>From which Con&s;iderations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;ons of dif|ferent Phaeno|mena in differ|ent Climates.</NOTE> I conceive, &s;ome Rea&s;ons may be drawn of
&s;everal Phaenomena taken notice of by Travellers; &s;uch as the frequency of
Foggs and Mi&s;ts and various &s;orts of <HI>Parhelia</HI> and <HI>Para&s;elenae,</HI> in and near the

of the frequent and violent Rains in the <HI>Torrid Zone;</HI> all which <HI>Phaenomena</HI>
are indications of an Atmo&s;phere much more extended upwards, and of the
vaporous Parts carry'd to a much greater height than el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Con&s;iderations al&s;o will follow a nece&s;&s;ary motion or tendency
of the lower Parts of the Air near the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Circulation of the lower &amp; upper parts of the Air.</NOTE> from the Polar Parts towards
the Aequinoctial, and con&s;equently of the higher Parts of the Air from the

<HEAD>Of the &s;tanding of the Mercury in the Tube to the height of 75 Inches,
read May the 28th. 1684.</HEAD>
<P>THat <HI>Theories</HI> are not altogether u&s;ele&s;s, we may perceive by the happy
invention of the ingenious <HI>Galileo,</HI> and the addition of the acute <HI>Torri|cellius,</HI>
which two compleated the Experiment of the <HI>Aethereal Vacuum;</HI> the
further Improvement and Ob&s;ervation of which hath produc'd the <HI>Barometer,</HI>
now u&s;eful for predicting the variation of the Weather, and the <HI>Pneumatick</HI>
Engine much more prolifick of di&s;coveries; the cau&s;es of mo&s;t of who&s;e
Phaenomena are &s;ufficiently obvious, and certainly known to be the Gravi|tation
and Spring of that part of the <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> which is call'd <HI>Air,</HI> and
agreed to by the mo&s;t accurate of the Modern Philo&s;ophers. But Mr.<HI>Hu|gens</HI>
about twenty Years &s;ince having tried Mr <HI>Boyle</HI>'s Experiment of making
Water de&s;cend in a Tube, the Orifice of which was inclo&s;ed in an exhau&s;ted
Receiver, found that if the Water were fir&s;t well freed from the Air that is
u&s;ually latent in it, and then inclo&s;ed, the Water would not de&s;cend in the
Pipe, tho' the pre&s;&s;ure of the Air were wholly taken off; this occa&s;ion'd the
trial to be made here with <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> in&s;tead of Water, and by many Experi|ments
it was at la&s;t found by Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> the Lord <HI>Broucher,</HI> and &s;everal o|thers,
that the <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> al&s;o when the Tube was very well freed from
the latent Particles of Air, would not part from the top of a Tube, tho' it
were twice as high as the u&s;ual height the <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> u&s;ed to &s;tand at; and
tho' there were no more pre&s;&s;ure upon the &s;tagnant Ve&s;&s;el than was u&s;ual,
and that the bottom of the Tube were as open and free for the <HI>Mercury</HI> to
run out, as was u&s;ual for Experiments of the Mercurial Standard. This
&s;eem'd at fir&s;t to overthrow the Theory of the Gravity of the Air, and was
made u&s;e of by &s;ome <HI>Antagoni&s;ts</HI> to that purpo&s;e, but with little rea&s;on; for
it was ob&s;erv'd, that in the making this Experiment if a little Jog were
given to the Tube in which the <HI>Mercury</HI> thus remain'd &s;u&s;pended, the
<HI>Mercury</HI> would immediately leave the top and fall down in the Tube to the
u&s;ual height of about thirty Inches, and there exhibit all the &s;ame Phaeno|mena
as the common Mercurial Standard or Torricellian Experiment had
been ob&s;erv'd to do. However it could not but affect the inqui&s;itive after the
cau&s;es of things, with a di&s;ire of &s;atisfying them&s;elves with &s;ome probable
Conjectures at the cau&s;es of this &s;o &s;trange an Effect, &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ing one
thing, &s;ome another; what my Conjectures were, and &s;till are, I &s;hall in
brief declare and leave them to be con&s;ider'd by &s;uch as have better Abilities,
and &s;hall plea&s;e to trouble them&s;elves with &s;uch inquiries.</P>
<P>Since I fir&s;t made the Experiment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proof of the Aether.</NOTE> I &s;aw an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of a pre&s;&s;ing
Fluid very much more &s;ubtile than the Air, and yet con&s;i&s;ting of parts of a deter|minate
bulk, which would ea&s;ily &s;train through and pervade the Pores of Gla&s;s,
Water and other Bodies impervious to the Air, but could be kept out by the
nearer Conjunction of &s;ome of the con&s;tiuent parts of tho&s;e Bodies which con&s;ti|tute
Pores of a much le&s;s Magnitude or Capacity, which fluid I &s;uppos'd might
be &s;omewhat of the Nature of the &s;econd Element of <HI>De&s;cartes,</HI> tho' for
many Rea&s;ons drawn from Experiments, I &s;uppos'd it to have many differing
Proprieties from tho&s;e which he a&s;cribes to his, and I &s;aw al&s;o a nece&s;&s;ity of
&s;uppo&s;ing a third Element con&s;i&s;ting of a matter yet more &s;ubtile and fluid,
<PB N="366" REF="345">
as he &s;uppo&s;es, and more then that, of &s;everal other fluid Matters, &s;ome
more &s;ubtile than others, each of which have their proprieties di&s;tinct, and
are the cau&s;es of this or that Phaenomenon in the World, of which there hath
as yet been no intelligible rea&s;on given of their Power and Original, as I
may hereafter &s;hew in the Explication of &s;ome of them. And I do believe,
from that little in&s;ight I have had of the Operations of Nature, that all the
&s;en&s;ible part of the World is almo&s;t infinitely the lea&s;t part of the Body there|of,
and but, as it were, the <HI>Cuticula,</HI> or outward Filme of things; whereas
that which fills up and compleats the &s;pace incompa&s;s'd by that Filme con&s;i&s;ts
of a multitude of in&s;en&s;ible Bodies, each of them as di&s;tinct in their Natures
and Operations, as Air and Quick&s;ilver, or any other two &s;en&s;ible Bodies
we can name; for &s;o many, &s;o curious, and &s;o minute are the in&s;en&s;ible work|ings
of Nature, that without &s;uppo&s;ing &s;ome &s;uch In&s;truments as the&s;e we
&s;hall quickly find a <HI>non plus</HI> in the explication of any one appearance in Na|ture.
But for the finding out the Number and Nature, of the&s;e Elements
we can proceed but by &s;low and &s;ingle &s;teps, and 'tis not to be expected but
from a long and clo&s;e pro&s;ecution of Nature as we &s;ee that the pre&s;&s;ure of the
Air was not detected till <HI>Galileo</HI> and <HI>Torricellius</HI> happily light upon that No|tion,
and this &s;econd Element was not experimentally manife&s;ted till the
making of this Experiment of the <HI>Mercury</HI>'s &s;tanding much above the height
di&s;cover'd by <HI>Torricellius.</HI> The matter on which the Load&s;tone works will
perhaps be found another, and that which cau&s;eth Gravity a Fourth.
But this by the bye.</P>
<P>My Notion and Explication of this Phaenomenon is this, That there is an|other
fluid Body; this Fluid is the Men&s;truum or Liquor into which the Air
is di&s;&s;olv'd like a Tincture of Cocheneel into Water, which, as I have explain'd
in the 15th Ob&s;ervation Micro&s;copical, <HI>Page</HI> 96, and 97, doth penetrate the
Pores of the Gla&s;s Water, and &s;everal other terraqueous Bodies (po&s;&s;ibly all
&s;uch as are tran&s;parent, for that I have not a &s;ufficient &s;upellex as yet to de|termine
po&s;itively; nor is it material for the Explication of this Phaeno|menon,
as other more curious and critical Experiments &s;hall be found out, it
will be time enough to determine it.)</P>
<P>Next that this fluid, as all other &s;en&s;ible fluids we meet with, hath a grea|ter
Congruity or Incongruity to this or that Body it is contiguous to, and
therefore doth more readily join to this Homogeneous than to that Hetero|geneous
Body, whether Solid or Fluid, and doth more ea&s;ily penetrate the
&s;mall Pores of the Homogeneous, and not without &s;ome difficulty the Pores
of the Heterogeneous Bodies. And in &s;hort, that this Congruity or Incongruity
of it to other Bodies doth make it perform the &s;ame kinds of Effects with
tho&s;e we find perform'd by &s;en&s;ible Fluids and Solids, &s;uch as I have expli|cated
in my &s;ixth Mycro&s;copical Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That this Fluid doth not at all penetrate the Body of <HI>Quick&s;ilver,</HI>
tho' <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> may be penetrated by a great number of other more &s;ubtile
Fluids, &s;uch as tho&s;e which cau&s;e Gravity, Magneti&s;m, Fluidity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if at
lea&s;t it &s;hall be found nece&s;&s;ary by future Experiments to a&s;cribe tho&s;e three
Properties to more than one fluid.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That &s;everal other Liquours who&s;e greater Pores are penetrated
by this Fluid, may yet be &s;u&s;tain'd by it above the level equivalent to twenty
nine Inches of <HI>Quicksilver,</HI> &s;o long as the Pores are not &s;o far &s;eperated as to
admit the parts of this Fluid between them where they are more neerly con|tiguous,
and have &s;ome more &s;ubtile fluid Body only between them. Of this
kind Water well purged of Air may be one, as the Experiment of the not
&s;ub&s;iding of Water purg'd of Air doth maaife&s;t.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That this Fluid hath a pre&s;&s;ure every way analogous to the pre&s;&s;ure
of the Air, and that this pre&s;&s;ure is much greater than that of the Air.</P>
<P>Sixthly, That there is no need (for the explicating any Experiment I have
yet heard of) of &s;uppo&s;ing it to have a &s;pringy Nature like that of the Air,
&s;ince all the Phaenomena may be &s;olved without it.</P>
<P>For the more intelligibe Explication of this Solution, I &s;hall indeavour to
&s;hew an Experiment very much like it, in &s;en&s;ible Bodies. I took then a &s;mall
Gla&s;s Cane <HI>a, b, c,</HI> open at both ends, then having procur'd a long &s;mall Gla&s;s
<PB N="367" REF="346">
Pipe in a Lamp almo&s;t as &s;mall as a Hair, I brake it into a great many &s;hort
ones and made of them a Stopple by binding them together Fagot-wife
with thread, and melting Wax or Cement about them, &s;o as that none of their
Perforations were &s;topt, I put them into the end <HI>a, b,</HI> for a Stopple, then I
had another Cane of Gla&s;s big enough to contain the former wholly as Def.
which was fill'd with Water;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 8. Fig. 3.</NOTE> then the fir&s;t Tube with the open end down|wards
was immers'd into the &s;aid Tube Def. till the Water had fill'd the
whole, and the ends of the &s;mall Pipes <HI>iiiii,</HI> then gently rai&s;ing up the Tube
<HI>a, b, c,</HI> out of the Water, I found I could rai&s;e it &s;o high as that the Water in
the Tube <HI>a, b, c,</HI> did &s;tand above the Surface of <HI>g, h,</HI> the Water in the Gla&s;s
Def. &s;ome Inches. Wherein 'tis ob&s;ervable, that tho' all the ends of the Pipes <HI>iiii</HI>
were pervious to the Air, yet by rea&s;on of a greater Congruity of the Water
to Gla&s;s than of Air, the Air was not able to force its way thorough without
the help of the Gravity of the Cylinder of Water <HI>a, g, h, b;</HI> the &s;ame Experi|ment
I tried al&s;o with <HI>Quick&s;ilver,</HI> by making the Stopple <HI>k,</HI> of Bra&s;s, and
in&s;tead of the &s;mall Pipes caus'd to be drill'd, thro' the &s;ame a great number of
&s;mall holes, then by the help of <HI>Aqua Fortis</HI> I caus'd all tho&s;e holes to be whited
with <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> then holding my Finger again&s;t tho&s;e holes, and filling it with
<HI>Mercury</HI> and &s;topping the other end, and immerging it under other <HI>Mer|cury</HI>
in a Di&s;h, by degrees I rais'd the &s;ame, and found that the Air would
not force its way in at the above-&s;aid drill'd holes, till the end <HI>A, b,</HI> was
rais'd above the level of the <HI>Mercury</HI> in the Di&s;h &s;ome Inches.</P>
<P>From both which Experiments 'twill not be difficult to under&s;tand my ex|plication
of this Phaenomenon of the extroardinary hight of the <HI>Mercury</HI> in a
Tube, well fill'd, and perfectly cleans'd of Air: For if we &s;uppo&s;e in the for|mer
Experiment, that the Ambient Air doth repre&s;ent the Ambient Fluid,
who&s;e pre&s;&s;ure we do &s;uppo&s;e, and that the Perforations of the &s;mall Pipes
do repre&s;ent the imaginary Pores of Gla&s;s, and that the Water with which
it is fill'd doth repre&s;ent the <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> in the new Experiment, and that we
&s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> hath a greater Congruity to Gla&s;s than the other,
and that con&s;equently it keeps the other from getting a Body within the hol|low
of rhe Tube by &s;topping it at its fir&s;t entry, 'twill be ea&s;ie to imagine
how, tho' the Gla&s;s can be &s;uppo&s;ed all over Porous, through which the Ae|ther
can pa&s;s, the Ambient new Fluid can by its more free pre&s;&s;ure on the
Surface of the bottom, keep the <HI>Mercury</HI> &s;u&s;pended forty five Inches above
the former Standard of thirty Inches.</P>
<P>Nor doth the &s;econd Experiment explicate it le&s;s naturally; for the Air
repre&s;ents the Aether, or what other name &s;oever it be call'd by: The <HI>Quick|&s;ilver</HI>
in the one repre&s;ents the <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> in the other. Immer&s;e that Di&s;h
in a Bucket of Water, and you &s;hall find that the top of the Tube will be
rais'd con&s;iderably higher above the Surface of the <HI>Mercury,</HI> in the Di&s;h be|fore
the <HI>Mercury</HI> will leave the top; Then the Water, under which the <HI>Mer|cury</HI>
is immers'd, will repre&s;ent the Air or Atmo&s;phere, and the holes in the
Bra&s;s Stopper, the Pores of the Gla&s;s, the additional rai&s;ing of the height
of the <HI>Mercury</HI> after 'tis put under Water will &s;hew how part of the &s;eventy
five Inches is a&s;cribable to the pre&s;&s;ure of the Air, and the other height will
&s;hew how another part of it is a&s;cribable to the pre&s;&s;ure of the Aether. I think I
need not explain it farther, only 'tis ob&s;ervable, that tho' the Air finds a difficul|ty
to make its fir&s;t entry into the &s;mall holes of the Gla&s;s Pipes, or of the
Bra&s;s Stopper, yet after it hath got through, and that there is Air within
the Tube as well as without, it very readily and freely maintains its Pa&s;&s;age,
and the &s;ame <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> al&s;o happens in the <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> Experiment, for as
&s;oon as ever the <HI>Mercury</HI> begins to &s;eperate from the top of the Tube, and the
Aether hath a Body within the Tube, it readily falls down to the height &s;upport|ed
by the pre&s;&s;ure of the Air. The Rea&s;on of the two preceding Experi|ments,
to wit, of the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of Water in the Tube who&s;e end is &s;top|ped
with a bundle of &s;mall Gla&s;s Pipes, as al&s;o of the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the
<HI>Mercury</HI> in the Tube who&s;e end is &s;topp'd with the perforated peice of Bra&s;s,
will be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Congruity &amp; Incongruity.</NOTE> I think, &s;ufficiently manife&s;t to him that &s;hall thoroughly con&s;ider
the Nature of the Congruity and Incongruity of Bodies to one another; &s;ome|what
of my Thoughts concerning the &s;ame I have formerly deliver'd in the
<PB N="368" REF="347">
&s;ixth Ob&s;ervation of my Micrography, which was indeed but a cur&s;ory Me|ditation
for the &s;olving of the Phaenomenon then mention'd; but who&s;oever
&s;hall thoroughly examine the Nature and Power of it, will, I dobut not, find
it much more univer&s;al. To me indeed it &s;eems to be not only the cau&s;e of
this extraordinary <HI>Phaenomenon,</HI> but of the Conglobation and Tenacity of mo&s;t
Liquors of the Tenacity Springyne&s;s, Sonorou&s;ne&s;s, Malleability, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of all
&s;olid and hard Bodies: But of this el&s;ewhere when I have occa&s;in to examine
what is the cau&s;e of Congruity it&s;elf, which I do not &s;uppo&s;e a fir&s;t Principle,
but rather of a &s;econd, third, or fourth Rank, which being more univer&s;al,
mu&s;t be a&s;cended to by degrees, after the Synthetick method. To proceed
then, I did heretofore propound in the twentieth Page of my Micrography
as a thing worthy trial to examine what Power was requi&s;ite to force a Liquor
through holes of &s;everal bigne&s;es made in a Heterogeneous &s;olid, and fill'd with
&s;ome Liquor Homogeneous to that &s;olid; for were that accurately done
I judge this Experiment of the extraordinary height of the <HI>Mercury</HI> above the u&s;ual Standard would give us a demon&s;tration of the bigne&s;s of the Pores
of Gla&s;s; for &s;ince we find that a hole of&mdash;of an Inch will make the <HI>Mer|cury</HI>
&s;tand &s;u&s;pended one Inch in height a hole of&mdash;of an Inch will make it
&s;tand &s;u&s;pended two Inches; a hole of&mdash;of an Inch will make it &s;tand three
Inches, it will follow that a hole of&mdash;of an Inch will make it &s;tand forty
five Inches, and a hole of&mdash;of an Inch will make it &s;tand a hundred Inches,
which minds me of &s;everal other Experiments worth trial, for determining
this controver&s;y; &s;uch as the&s;e;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Expe|riments hinted</NOTE> Whether &s;ome Gla&s;&s;es are not more porous than others, and con&s;e|quently
whether the <HI>Mercury</HI> will not &s;tand to a much greater height in Tubes
made of Gla&s;s of a more opacous or more refracting Sub&s;tance than in Tubes
of a more tran&s;parent or le&s;s refracting Sub&s;tance.</P>

the <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> will not &s;tand &s;u&s;pended to a much greater height than it doth
in Tubes of Gla&s;s, for if Lead, Silver, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be impervious to this fluid Sub|&s;tance
that &s;o freely penetrates Gla&s;s, it &s;eems not improbable, but that the
<HI>Mercury</HI> may &s;tand &s;u&s;pended to a very much greater height, and if &s;o it will
be a certain way of finding out the force or pre&s;&s;ure of this fluid; from the
determination of which will follow probably the rea&s;on of the Strength,
Weight, Sonorou&s;ne&s;s and Springyne&s;s of Metals. And I am the more in|clin'd
to believe that this Experiment will &s;ucceed, becau&s;e I judge that the
&s;ame fluid that conveieth height, is the cau&s;e of this Phaenomenon; and what|&s;oever
Body is perfectly impervious to Light, is al&s;o impervious to this fluid.
But herein I would be under&s;tood not to mean &s;uch Bodies, as by the thick|ne&s;s
of their bulk and &s;ome degree of opacou&s;ne&s;s, do intercept the direct
pa&s;&s;age of this fluid Matter, and &s;o by con&s;equence cau&s;e a kind of opacou&s;|ne&s;s,
as a thick Body of Red and Blew, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Gla&s;s which notwith&s;tanding are
not perfectly opacous Bodies, becau&s;e, when made very thin, they are tran&s;|parent
of a Red or Blew Colour: For &s;uch Bodies tho' they may intercept
the direct pa&s;&s;age of the Light, yet may they admit the fluid freely to pa&s;s
through their winding Pores, and &s;o may not perhaps keep the <HI>Mercury</HI> &s;u|&s;pended
much higher than a Tube of Cry&s;tal-gla&s;s; whereas I am very apt
to think, that if there could be a Tube made of a Sub&s;tance perfectly impe|rvious
to this fluid Matter, the <HI>Mercury</HI> may po&s;&s;ibly remain &s;u&s;pended as ma|ny
Feet as it doth now Inches; but this trial will more fully inform. Now
that a Body may be pervious to &s;ome Liquors and yet not pervious to Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A way to di&s;|cover the Mi|cro&s;copical Pores of Bo|dies.</NOTE>
is evident by the Experiment of forcing <HI>Mercury</HI> through the Pores of Wood,
for if you take a Pipe of Beech, Elm, Oak, Firr, A&s;h, or the like, of four,
five, &s;ix, eight, or ten Foot long, and &s;topping one end thereof, you erect
it with the open upwards and fill it with <HI>Quicksilver,</HI> you &s;hall find that the
<HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> will as freely and plentifully pa&s;s through the Micro&s;copical or
Imperceptible Pores of the &s;ame, almo&s;t as it will be &s;train'd through the
<PB N="369" REF="348">
Pores of Cloath, Linnen or Leather, and will thereby &s;o fill the Pores of the
Wood as to make it feel almo&s;t as heavy as Lead; by this way I have been a|ble
to force <HI>Mercury</HI> into the Pores of Charcole, and divers other Vegetable
Sub&s;tances, whereby the Pores of the &s;ame are made very con&s;pncious, by
placing &s;mall peices of tho&s;e Sub&s;tances at the bottom of a Gla&s;s Tube of
four, &s;ix, eight, or ten Foot long, and filling the Tube with <HI>Mercury</HI> over
them, for tho&s;e and mo&s;t other Vegetable Sub&s;tances; will, by the pre&s;&s;ure of
&s;uch a Cylinder of <HI>Mercury,</HI> be fill'd with <HI>Quick&s;ilver,</HI> and thereby plainly di&s;|cover
the Shape and Texture of their Pores. I have not had the opportunity
to try Bones, Horns, Teeth, Hair, Quills, and the like animal Sub&s;tances
this way, tho' it &s;eems to me very probable, that their Pores may be di&s;co|ver'd
this way, at lea&s;t by lengthing the Cylinder, and making the pre&s;&s;ure
yet greater, or by a conden&s;ing Engine. Nay, I am inclin'd to believe, that
<HI>Mercury</HI> may be forc'd even through the Pores of Gla&s;s it&s;elf if the Cylinder
pre&s;&s;ing be &s;ufficiently lengthned; for by this Experiment of the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of
<HI>Mercury</HI> at &s;eventy five Inches high, it &s;eems that <HI>Mercury</HI> has a greater Con|gruity
to Gla&s;s then the pre&s;&s;ing Fluid or Aether hath to the &s;ame, and there|fore
'tis not improbable but that a force as great in proportion to the bulk of
<HI>Mercury,</HI> as the force of the Aether is to the bulk of the Aether, may force
it through the Pores of Gla&s;s, that it may be &s;ubtile enough to do it, &s;eems
probable from this, that it doth &s;o readily penetrate the Pores of Gold, Tin,
Lead, Silver, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> tho&s;e Bodies with whom it hath a perfect Congruity even
with meer appo&s;ition and contiguity; and therefore 'tis not improbable but
that a degree of force may make it penetrate the Pores of Gla&s;s, which in
probability are much greater than tho&s;e of the congruous Metals, e&s;pecially
&s;ince we find it can be forc'd into the Pores of Wood, Cork, Pith, Coles <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
&s;o as to drive out the Juices contain'd in them; whereas tho&s;e Juices having
a greater Congruity, do penetrate them by meer appo&s;ition. Now that this
penetrancy of <HI>Mercury</HI> into Gla&s;s is not meerly conjectural, I &s;hall &s;hew you
by taking notice of certain Spots or Stains which I have found in poli&s;h'd
Looking-gla&s;s-Plates after they have remain'd a long while foil'd, and then
being unfoil'd, for I have very plainly &s;een with a Micro&s;cope that there hath
been in the place, where &s;pots appear, an infinite number of exceeding minute
Parts of <HI>Mercury</HI> which &s;eem to be gotten into the very Pores of Gla&s;s, and
can by no kind of rubbing be fetcht out without wearing away &s;o much of
$he very Sub&s;tance of the Gla&s;s it&s;elf: What therefore is thus done acciden|tally
by duration, might in probability be much better done by pre&s;&s;ure, if
we were able to make it con&s;iderable enough, as by letting down Gla&s;s in
<HI>Mercury</HI> to a very great depth under Water, where that can be done; or to
a con&s;iderable depth under the pre&s;&s;ure of <HI>Mercury.</HI> It may po&s;&s;ibly be Ob|jected,
that if <HI>Mercury</HI> hath a greater Congruity to Gla&s;s than this &s;uppos'd
Fluid, why doth not the <HI>Mercury</HI> without much force penetrate the Pores of
Gla&s;s at fir&s;t, and &s;o running through it, make it appear opacous. To which
I An&s;wer, That tho' I &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Mercury</HI> to have a greater Congruity to Gla&s;s
than this Subtile Fluid, yet that it hath not a perfect Congruity, but rather
an Incongruity in re&s;pect of other Fluids that are more Congruous, as Air.
Nor hath that a perfect Congruity, but rather an Incongruity in re&s;pect of
Water; for there may be infinite degrees of Congruity, as Water &s;alt hath
more Congruity to Gla&s;s than Water fre&s;h, Waters than Vinous Spirits, Vi|nous
Spirits more than Oils, Oils more than Airs and Fumes, and they more
than <HI>Mercury,</HI> and <HI>Mercury</HI> than this fluid Aether, or what other Name &s;o|ever
we call it by; and in every one of the&s;e degrees of Congruity or In|congruity
there may be a multitude of other Subdivi&s;ions; as for in&s;tance, un|der
the fir&s;t Head there may be a very great variety; I know &s;ome, acid Li|quours
that will of them&s;elves, without any force, penetrate the Pores of Gla&s;s
&s;o as to di&s;&s;olve it into a Powder, whereas others will not at all penetrate
or di&s;&s;olve it by any means I have yet found: But this part of Congruity and
Incongruity by which &s;olid Bodies become di&s;&s;oluble by Fluids, and where|by
Fluids readily penetrate each other, and unite with one part of a Fluid,
and &s;eparate or precipitate another, belonging to another Subject, I &s;hall pre|termit
<PB N="370" REF="349">
at pre&s;ent, and only take notice of &s;ome things that may be perti|nent
to the Inquiry under Con&s;ideration; and tho&s;e may be the&s;e;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That there is no difficulty at all in admitting, that within the &s;ame
Liquor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Variety afflu|ids in the &s;ame Liquor.</NOTE> which to the &s;ight appears uniform, there may be a greater variety of
Fluids of differing penetrancy, for we find in <HI>Aqua Regis</HI> for in&s;tance, that
there are the <HI>Sal Armoniack</HI> parts that help to penetrate Gold; the <HI>Nitrous</HI>
that penetrate Silver, Copper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the <HI>Flegme</HI> that will penetrate neither:
There have been few Experiments made of the penetrating of one Fluid by
an other, be&s;ide that I formerly &s;hew'd of Water and Oil of <HI>Vitriol,</HI> 'tis a
copious Head, and contains much of information; Copper and Tin melted
are an example of it. From which Ob&s;ervation we may without difficulty
&s;uppo&s;e the Air (as it is commonly taken) to be a Body con&s;i&s;ting of a great
variety of Fluids, of which this Aether we &s;uppp&s;e may be one; and po&s;&s;ibly
the principal which takes up the greate&s;t &s;pace, and who&s;e Effects are the
&s;u&s;pen&s;ion of <HI>Mercury</HI> above the height &s;u&s;pended by the pre&s;&s;ure of the Air and
the like; tho' yet I &s;uppo&s;e it not the &s;ubtile&s;t, there being many Experiments
that do &s;eem to require a much more &s;ubtile and penetrant Fluid, of which
more el&s;ewhere. The Ela&s;tical Part of the Air that cau&s;es the Phaenomena
of Springing a Second, the Steams of Bodies a Third, the Nitrous part a
Fourth, each of which have &s;everal degrees of penetrancy, and may po&s;&s;ibly
be &s;everal di&s;tinct Fluids, tho' when blended altogether they make that com|pound
Body, which we call the Element of Air. Now as the Air con&s;i&s;ts of
a variety of Fluids, &s;o 'tis not unlikely but that each of the&s;e may differ in
their proportionate quantity, and in their re&s;pective Gravity; &s;o that if we
&s;hould take the whole bulk of the Air or Atmo&s;phere we might po&s;&s;ibly find
it made up of divers Fluids,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. $. Fig. 4.</NOTE> as of the Fluids <HI>A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H,</HI> &amp;c.
and each of the&s;e of differing proprieties, both as to penetrations, Quantities
and Gravity, Congruity, and the like; and that That part of it which is next
the Earth might be a compound of the Fluids <HI>A, B, C, D,</HI> and <HI>G, H,</HI> exten|ding
to a certain number of Yards above the level of the Sea, the next part
of the Atmo&s;phere immediately above it may con&s;i&s;t of <HI>B, C, D, E,</HI> and <HI>G, H,</HI>
and have nothing of <HI>A</HI> or <HI>F.</HI> The third Region may con&s;i&s;t of <HI>C, D, E, F,
G, H,</HI> and have nothing of <HI>A,</HI> or <HI>B:</HI> And this &s;eems probable, Fr&s;t, becau&s;e
we find that there are &s;everal di&s;tinct Surfaces of the Air, upon which the
&s;everal Regions of the Clouds &s;eem to &s;wim like Froth upon the Surface
of Water; for 'tis obvious to any that &s;hall ob&s;erve it, to &s;ee the under Surface
of the Clouds &s;mooth and level, and the upper in confus'd heaps, and fur|ther,
that all the under Surfaces of Clouds appearing at the &s;ame time lye as
near as one can judge by the Eye in the very &s;ame Level. Next that the make
of the Clouds in a higher Region are quite differing. Thirdly, that the
parts of the Air in &s;everal heights from the Earth, have differing proprie|ties,
as it hath been found in very deep Wells, that the lower twenty Fa|thoms
were all po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by a Damp, or an Air in which no Fire would burn,
or Animal live. We are inform'd al&s;o, that the Air at the top of &s;ome ex|ceeding
high Mountains is of &s;uch a Nature as will not &s;erve for Re&s;piration.
Po&s;&s;ibly the pre&s;ence of <HI>A,</HI> in the lowe&s;t, may be the cau&s;e of the fir&s;t Ef|fects
and the want of <HI>B,</HI> at the tops of Mountains may be there the cau&s;e of

<P>I Have indeavour'd to di&s;cover and prove the true Figure of this Body of
the Earth upon which we Inhabit, and likewi&s;e to give &s;ome Conjectures
concerning the <HI>Form</HI> and <HI>Shape</HI> of the <HI>Superficial</HI> Parts thereof. This I have
done in order to comply as near as I could with a Natural Method of Natu|ral
Hi&s;tory: This great Body being the Mother of all Terre&s;tial Productions,
which make up the greate&s;t part of <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory;</HI> and the Foundation, as
it were, upon which, not only all that Hi&s;tory, but all the other Parts and
Super&s;tructures almo&s;t do re&s;t; for from the Productions of this we take our
Principles, we rai&s;e our Axioms and Maxims, we form our Similitudes, we
make our Ob&s;ervations, Experiments and Trials, and by Analogy from Com|pari&s;on
and Similitude we deduce our Conclu&s;ions. I thought it therefore
not improper, &s;ince Natural Hi&s;tory will carry us into forein Parts of the
World, very far remov'd from this our Country or the Earth, to be fir&s;t of
all a little acquainted, at lea&s;t, with what we have at home, that thereby we
may the better be able to ob&s;erve and judge of what tho&s;e far remote Parts
may pre&s;ent us with, whether they be like our own or not, in what they agree,
and in what they differ, that the&s;e we know at home may be the Standards
and Touch-&s;tones of all the re&s;t we meet withal Abroad.</P>
<P>In pro&s;ecution of this Method,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Figure of the Earth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> I began fir&s;t to &s;hew what &s;eem'd to me to
be the mo&s;t likely Figure of the whole Body, which I &s;hew'd for &s;everal Rea|&s;ons
&s;eem'd to be of a prolated Sphaeroidical Figure, not of a perfectly Glo|bular,
as mo&s;t Authors &s;uppo&s;e and affirm, much le&s;s of an Oblong Oval, as
the ingenious Author of the &s;acred Theory of the Earth, and &s;ome others,
have indeavour'd to make probable.</P>
<P>From this I deduc'd the prolated Sphaeroidical Figure of the Waters al&s;o,
and more eminently of the Air or Atmo&s;phere, and from that deduc'd the&s;e
Conclu&s;ions, That the Lines of Gravitation or Perpendicularity did not tend
to one &s;ingle point, as all hitherto have a&s;&s;erted, but to infinite points in the
middle parts of the Axis.</P>
<P>And that a Degree, or a 360th part of the <HI>Aequinoctial</HI> did not agree
exactly with any one Degree in a <HI>Meridian,</HI> and thence that the Magnitudes
of the re&s;pective Parallels were not to be e&s;timated as if the Body were truly
Globular.</P>
<P>From this I deduc'd a nece&s;&s;ity of a differing Gravitation of the &s;ame Bo|dy
in differing parts of the Earth, and thence a nece&s;&s;ity of a differing length
of Pendulums to mea&s;ure by their Vibrations the &s;ame quantity of time, by
which the univer&s;al Standard of Mea&s;ure, by &s;ome &s;uppos'd from the length of a
Pendulum, became questionable and dubious.</P>
<P>I have likewi&s;e &s;hewn what Ob&s;ervations of Cele&s;tial Bodies were likely to
be a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the perfecting and confirming of the&s;e Matters, at lea&s;t of
di&s;covering the Truth whether really &s;o or not.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o inquir'd concerning the fixedne&s;s and in&s;tability of the Terre&s;tial
Axis, and &s;hewn &s;ome Arguments to induce us to believe that it may have
and &s;uffer a mutation, and not be always fixt in the &s;ame parts of the Earth,
and by what methods that may be a&s;certain'd in a &s;hort time with more exactne&s;s
<PB N="372" REF="351">
than many Ages of Ob&s;ervations made with le&s;s accuratene&s;s would have
done.</P>
<P>And from thence I have deduc'd what would be &s;ome of the nece&s;&s;ary
Con&s;equences of &s;uch a mutation; &s;uch as the differing Latitude of places in
differing Ages. The differing Azymuth of Places as to one anothers Po&s;ition;
the differing Altitudes of Places with re&s;pect to the Superficies of the Sea, as
the Emerging of &s;ome places from below that Surface and the &s;inking un|der,
and the being overwhelm'd by that Surface in others, and con&s;equently
of changing the Nature, Soil, Climate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the &s;uperficial Parts of the
Surface; to which, as I conceiv'd, &s;ome alterations might be a&s;cribed.</P>
<P>But La&s;tly, I &s;hew'd that the ruggedne&s;s and inequalities of Hills and Dales,
Mountains and Lakes, and al&s;o the alterations of the&s;e &s;uperficial Parts of the
Earth, as to the &s;eeming Irregularities thereof at pre&s;ent, &s;eem'd to me to be
mo&s;t probably a&s;cribable to another Cau&s;e, which was Earthquakes and
Subterraneous Eruptions of Fire. That there had been many &s;uch altera|tions
I indeavour'd to prove from the almo&s;t univer&s;al Di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e
curious Medals of former Ages now found in the petrify'd Monuments of
the parts of &s;everal both Terre&s;tial and Aquatick Animals and Vegetables,
but e&s;pecially by tho&s;e Productions of the watery Element found in places
now far remov'd from the Sea, and far above its Level; of which I have
produc'd &s;everal In&s;tances, &s;ome of which, and tho&s;e very con&s;iderable, were
procur'd by the inqni&s;itivene&s;s of a Per&s;on here pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I have made &s;ome Excur&s;ions out of this Method; as Fir&s;t, in order to
an&s;wer the Doubts and Scruples of some, and the Obloquies of &s;ome other
Per&s;ons, who, I hope, are now, or will be &s;omewhat better &s;atisfy'd, which
I wi&s;h all might be, for I have no de&s;ire to impo&s;e Conjectures and Inquiries
as Demon&s;trations, but only to &s;hew what Arguments have inclin'd me to be
of the&s;e Opinions, which, whether &s;ufficient, I mu&s;t leave to their better
Judgments and Examinations, hoping at lea&s;t that no prepo&s;e&s;&s;ion will hinder
them from examining them with Candor and Indifference, as I indeavour to
do in all my Inquiries. Next by &s;ome Experiments made for the clearing &s;ome
accidental Di&s;cour&s;es at the meeting, as tho&s;e about the be&s;t ways of com|municating
force at a di&s;tance, and of making a Pendulum to ob&s;erve by
Trials the Velocities of the parts of Pendulous Vibration, and to make a
Pendulum that &s;hall, without Clock-work, continue moving twelve Hours or
longer. And Thirdly, By accidental Ob&s;ervations made of the growth of
Trees and &s;ome others; nor will it, I hope, be taken ami&s;s that I indeavour
to produce &s;uch Arguments as occur to me, that &s;eem to favour the&s;e Con|jectures,
tho' po&s;&s;ibly much better may be &s;hewn by others eithers for or a|gain&s;t
them; however give me leave to alledge what I can to an&s;wer &s;uch as
I conceive are not &s;ufficiently cogent Arguments again&s;t what I have &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Objections I have yet heard, is, that Hi&s;to|ry
has not furni&s;h'd us with Relations of any &s;uch con&s;iderable changes as I
&s;uppos'd to have happen'd in former Ages of the World; I do confe&s;s our
Natural Hi&s;tory as to the&s;e and many other matters of the fir&s;t Ages is very
thin and barren, but yet I conceive not wholly devoyd of In&s;tances, nay,
po&s;&s;ibly if they be look'd into with a little more attention than hitherto has
been u&s;ed, they may be found to contain many more than has of late Ages
been imagin'd. Some things of this kind, I fancy I have detected, of which
I &s;hall produce &s;ome, together with &s;ome Remarks upon them, which I have
added, they are, I conceive, related as true Hi&s;tories; but whether &s;o or not
I mu&s;t leave others to judge who are better Antiquaries and Criticks.</P>
<P>What Learning and Accounts of Ancient Times the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> might have
in their Hi&s;tories,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Account of the Atlantis out of <HI>Plato</HI>'s Timaeus.</NOTE> who are &s;aid by <HI>Plato</HI> in his <HI>Timaeus,</HI> to have had accounts
of great alterations in the World for nine thou&s;and Years before <HI>Salon,</HI> which
is now above two thou&s;and Years &s;ince, it is very hard to gue&s;s from that short
account that is there given of it; yet &s;ince of all the Records that are to be
met within the Ancient Hi&s;torians to this purpo&s;e, this is the mo&s;t con&s;ider|able,
I thought it would not be improper to relate it on this occa&s;ion, by
rea&s;on that tho' it &s;hould be accounted <HI>fabulous,</HI> as &s;ome have thought, and
<PB N="373" REF="352">
to be only a Fiction in <HI>Plato</HI> in order to lay a Scene for his Republick; yet
there is &s;o much of Probability in it (bating only his number of Years) and
&s;o much of Rea&s;on and Agreement with the State of things, that if it be
not a true Hi&s;tory, it will at lea&s;t &s;hew that <HI>Plato</HI> him&s;elf had, at that time,
&s;ome &s;uch Notion or Imagination of the <HI>Preceding State of the Earth,</HI> and that
he &s;aw, or found at lea&s;t, &s;ome very good Arguments for his being &s;o; <HI>Plato</HI>
then in his Dialogue maketh <HI>Critias</HI> thus &s;peak, &startq;Hear, O <HI>Socrates,</HI> a won|derful
indeed, but yet a true Hi&s;tory, which <HI>Solon,</HI> the wi&s;e&s;t of the &s;even
Wi&s;e Men, related to my Grandfather <HI>Critias,</HI> as the old Man hath &s;ince
told me; among other things he told me of the memorable Actions of this
City (<HI>Athens</HI>) by length of Time, and Death of many, quite obliterated.
But among the re&s;t he related one remarkable Pa&s;&s;age, which I think now
proper to acquaint you with, and it was an old Hi&s;tory, which he being
then about ninty Years old, told to me when I was about Ten, upon a &s;olemn
Day, when I, with divers other Boys, as the Cu&s;tom was, were wont to re|cite
divers Ver&s;es by Heart to &s;ee which could excel, among which were
divers Ver&s;es of <HI>Solon:</HI> And I remember I heard my Grandfather then &s;ay,
that if <HI>Solon</HI> had but committed to Ver&s;e, not what he did for refre&s;hing
of his Mind, but &s;eriously, and like other Poets, the Hi&s;tory, which he,
returning out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> re&s;olv'd to have written (from which, by di&s;turbances
which he met with at home, he was interrupted in perfecting) neither <HI>Ho|mer,
He&s;iod,</HI> nor any other Poet, would have been comparable to him. This
was of the greate&s;t Affair that had been tran&s;acted by this City, of which
we have no remains at pre&s;ent, by rea&s;on of the length and injury of Time.
The &s;umm of what I remember was, That <HI>Solon</HI> going into <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>Saim,</HI> at the
Mouth of the <HI>Nile,</HI> when <HI>Ama&s;is</HI> was King, was there receiv'd honourably.
There he inquiring of tho&s;e Prie&s;ts which were mo&s;t skilful in tho&s;e Matters
concerning the Memorials of great Antiquity, found, as he related, that
neither him&s;elf nor any other Greek knew any thing of Antiquity; and
when he to provoke the Prie&s;ts to tell him &s;ome of their Knowledge, had, in
there pre&s;ence, &s;poken concerning the mo&s;t antient Actions of the <HI>Athenians</HI>
of <HI>Phoroneus</HI> and <HI>Niobe,</HI> and of <HI>Pyrrha</HI> and <HI>Deucalion,</HI> after the inundation of
the World, and of the times when tho&s;e had happen'd; one of the Seniors
of the Prie&s;ts cried, O <HI>Solon, Solon,</HI> you Greeks are all Boys, not one Old
Man among you. <HI>Solon</HI> asking him why &s;o? The Prie&s;t an&s;wer'd, beeau&s;e
you have young Heads always that contain nothing of ancient Hi&s;tory,
of ancient Opinion, or of Old Mens Science, which has happen'd to you by
rea&s;on that there have been already, and &s;hall be many and various De|&s;tructions
of Men: But the greate&s;t of all will be caus'd nece&s;&s;arily, either
by a Conflagation of Fire, or an Inundation of Water; but the le&s;&s;er by
innumerable other Calamities: For what you tell of <HI>Phaeton,</HI> the Son of the
Sun to have got into his Father's Chariot, and not knowing how to Drive
like his Father, had fired the Earth, and with that Flame had almo&s;t &s;et
Fire to the Heavens, tho' it may &s;eem fabulous, yet 'tis not without its
truth in &s;ome &s;en&s;e. For in long proce&s;s of time there is a certain <HI>permuta|tion
of the Caele&s;tial Motions which a va&s;t Inflammation mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow.</HI>
Whence &s;uch as inhabit high and dry Places will &s;uffer more than &s;uch as are
nearer the Sea and Rivers. Now our <HI>Nil$,</HI> as it is in mo&s;t other things ve|ry
whole&s;ome for us, &s;o will it pre&s;erve us from &s;uch a De&s;truction. But
when the Gods of the Waters &s;hall wa&s;h away the Filth of the Earth by a
Flood, tho&s;e which feed Sheep and other Cattle at the tops of the Moun|tains
will &s;cape the danger; but your Cities that are &s;ituated in the Plains,
by the impetuo&s;ity of &s;uch Floods will be &s;wept into the Sea. But in our
Region we have no Water de&s;cends from above, but all ours &s;prings out of
the very Bowels of the Earth; which is the rea&s;on that with us the Re|cords
and Monuments of the mo&s;t antient things are &s;afely pre&s;erved.
Whence it comes to pa&s;s, that where neither too great a Storm of Rain
nor any extraordinary Fire happens, tho' &s;ometimes more, &s;ometimes fewer,
yet &s;till &s;ome Men always e&s;cape. Now whatever we hear that is worthy
notice, either acted by our &s;elves, you, or any other Nation we keep de&s;crib|ed,
in our Temples: With you indeed, and other Nations things lately
<PB N="374" REF="353">
done have been committed to Writing, and pre&s;erved by other Monu|ments.
But in certain periods of Time there come from the Heavens cer|tain
De&s;tructions which depopulate all; whence the following Generations are
depriv'd both of Letters and Learning. Whence you are all again made
Boys, rude, and altogether ignorant of preceding Matters. Hence 'tis that
what but now you &s;peak of, O <HI>Solon,</HI> differs very little from Childi&s;h Fa|bles.
Fir&s;t, In that you make mention but of one Inundation, whereas
many have preceeded. Next, That the &s;tock of your Ance&s;tors which was
mo&s;t Eminent, and of the be&s;t, you know nothing of; whence both thy &s;elf
and the other <HI>Atheneans</HI> had your Birth, which was a &s;mall Remnant that
&s;caped the publick De&s;truction: Which becomes unknown to you; for that
this Remnant and their Po&s;terity for many Years wanted the u&s;e of Let|ters;
whereas your City before that had excelled both in the Arts of War
and Peace, of which we had a full account.&endq; [So he proceeds to tell how
they had Records of their own City for nine Thou&s;and Years, and of the
Laws, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as al&s;o, of long times for <HI>Athens,</HI> which I pa&s;s over, and only
mention what &s;eems to relate to Natural Hi&s;tory.] He proceeds then,
&startq;Many wonderful Actions of your City are pre&s;erved in our Monuments;
but one above the re&s;t for Greatne&s;s and Virtue exceeds; for 'tis &s;aid, that
your City re&s;i&s;ted a numberle&s;s company of Enemies, which coming out of
the Country where the <HI>Atlantick-Sea</HI> now is, had conquer'd almo&s;t all <HI>Eu|rope</HI>
and <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> for at that time was that navigable Streight which is call'd
that of <HI>Hercules Pillers</HI> which had near the Mouth, and as it were in the
very entrance of it, an I&s;land then &s;aid to be bigger than <HI>Lybia</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia,</HI>
through which was a Pa&s;&s;age to other Neighbouring I&s;lands, and from the
I&s;lands was a pro&s;pect to the main Lands lying near the Shoar, but the
Mouth of the Streights was very narrow. This Sea was truly the Ocean,
and the Land was truly a Continent. In this <HI>Atlantick I&s;land</HI> was a mo&s;t
great and wonderful Power of Kings, who Rul'd over, not only that whole
I&s;le and many others, but over the greate&s;t part of the Continent, and e|ven
over tho&s;e which were near us, for they Reigned over a third part of the
World, which is call'd <HI>Lybia</HI> even unto <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and over <HI>Europe</HI> even to the
<HI>Tyrrhene</HI> Sea; the whole power of the&s;e collected together, invaded both
ours, and your Country, and even all the Lands within the <HI>Hercule$$</HI>
Streights, but both your and our Country repell'd them; the manner I o|mit.
Afterwards by a prodigious Earthquake and Inundation which hap|pened
in a Day and a Night, the Earth cleaving &s;wallow'd up all tho&s;e War|like
Men, and this I&s;land of <HI>Atlantis</HI> was drown'd by a va&s;t Inundation of
the Sea, by which means that Sea became unnavigable, by rea&s;on of the Mud
of that &s;unken I&s;land which was left&punc; the re&s;t I omit.&endq; Now,</P>
<P>Whether this Relation be a Fiction or Romance invented by <HI>Plato,</HI> or a
true Hi&s;tory, I &s;hall not now di&s;pute, only by all the Circum&s;tances of <HI>Plato</HI>'s
relating of it, I conceive he de&s;ign'd to have it to be reputed a true Hi&s;tory
and not a Romance, for that his de&s;ign for laying a Scheme for his imaginary
Government, needed no &s;uch Fiction, and accordingly he made very little, if
any, u&s;e of the Circum&s;tances of it that relate to Natural Hi&s;tory. How|ever,
be it what it will, it evidently &s;hews that <HI>Plato</HI> did &s;uppo&s;e and believe
that there had been in many preceding Ages of the World, very great changes
of the &s;uperficial Parts of the Earth by Floods, Deluges, Earthquakes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
for as much as he could &s;uppo&s;e a Continent or I&s;land as big as the third part
of the known Earth, to be by one Earthquake &s;unk into the Sea and over|whelmed
by it.</P>
<P>I think therefore I may at lea&s;t conclude, that divers of the Antients, and
particularly <HI>Plato,</HI> had &s;ome knowledge of pa&s;t Cata&s;trophys of &s;ome parts of
the World. And tho&s;e to have been caus'd by Earthquakes and fiery Erupti|ons,
&s;uch as had &s;unk &s;ome places into the Sea and rais'd other places out of
it, of great Floods al&s;o and Inundations by Rains and Eruptions of the Sea:
And that &s;ome of tho&s;e had happened in <HI>Greece,</HI> others without the Streights
Mouth, and others el&s;ewhere, and at another opportunity I &s;hall produce a
Cloud of Witne&s;&s;es to this effect, which, I conceive, will put it pa&s;t di&s;pute&punc;
but becau&s;e this Relation has been po&s;&s;ibly too long, I &s;hall only add one Re|lation
<PB N="375" REF="354">
more, becau&s;e it &s;eems to relate to the remainders of the I&s;land of <HI>At|lantis,</HI>
and it &s;eems to be of a later date much than the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Stories.</P>
<P>That which I mean is the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Periplus</HI> of <HI>Hanno</HI> the <HI>Carthaginian.</HI>
When it was writ I know not, but &s;ure it was very ancient, 'tis lately in the
Year 1674, Publi&s;h'd by <HI>Abrahamus Berkelius,</HI> with &s;ome fragments of <HI>Stepha|nus
Byzantinus,</HI> with the Commentaries of <HI>Ge&s;nerus</HI> and <HI>Bochart,</HI> being but

and build <HI>Lybyphenician</HI> Cities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hi&s;tory of <HI>Hanno</HI>'s Cir|cumnavigation.</NOTE> he went then with &s;ixty &s;ail of Ships each
rowed with fifty Oars, in the&s;e were tran&s;ported to the number of 30 Thou&s;|and
Men and Women with nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ion and Stores. After we had
&s;ailed two Days without the Columns; the fir&s;t City we built we call'd <HI>Thy|miaterium;</HI>
under this lay a large Plain, thence carried We&s;tward we made
<HI>Solunte</HI> a Cape of <HI>Lybia</HI> cover'd with Wood, where having built a Fane to <HI>Nep|tune,</HI>
we tacked about and &s;ailed <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> towards the South, half a
Days &s;ail into a Lake not far from the Sea, filled with many and large Canes,
where were fed Elephants and various other wild Bea&s;ts; having pa&s;&s;ed this
Lake in one Days &s;ail, we built tho&s;e Maritime Cities, <HI>viz. Caricus, Gytte,
Acra, Meli&s;&s;a</HI> and <HI>Aranibys;</HI> &s;ailing thence we arriv'd at the great River <HI>Lix|us</HI>
which falls out of <HI>Libya.</HI> Near this the <HI>Nomades</HI> (a &s;ort of Gra&s;iers or
Cattle-herds) and <HI>Lixitae</HI> feed their Cattle, with the&s;e having made Friend|&s;hip
we &s;tay'd &s;ometime. Beyond this the &s;avage <HI>Aethiopians</HI> live, who&s;e
Country is full of wild Bea&s;ts, and intercepted with great Mountains from
which the <HI>Lixus</HI> flows. Tho&s;e Mountains the <HI>Trogloditae</HI> inhabit a &s;trong
&s;ort of People &s;wifter in Running than Hor&s;es, as the <HI>Lixitae</HI> told us. From
hence we coa&s;ted two Days Southwards, and then one Day more <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
and in a Bay found a &s;mall I&s;land five Stadia in Compa&s;s, where we left &s;ome
Planters and called it <HI>Cerne;</HI> this, by the Journal of our Voyage, we judged
to be in the &s;ame parallel with <HI>Carthage,</HI> and as far without the Columns as
<HI>Carthage</HI> was within. Hence we enter'd a great Lake, through which pa&s;t
a great River, which we called <HI>Chre&s;es.</HI> There we found three I&s;lands bigger
than <HI>Cerne.</HI> From the&s;e in a Days Voyage we reach'd the inermo&s;t parts of
the Lake: It was incompa&s;&s;ed with va&s;t Mountains, inhabited by Savages,
who threw Stones at us. Thence &s;ailing we pa&s;t a large River full of Cro|codiles
and Hippopotams, and return'd to <HI>Cerne.</HI> From hence we pa&s;t twelve
Days by the Coa&s;t towards the South, all inhabited by <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> much a|fraid
of us, and not under&s;tood by our Interpreters; the la&s;t day we di&s;co|ver'd
great Mountains covered with Woods, which were of various Kinds
and Odoriferous. Coa&s;ting round the&s;e Mountains we found an immen&s;e
opening of the Sea, that &s;ide which was next the Continent was a plain Coun|try,
from whence by Night we perceived Fires from all places, &s;ome greater
&s;ome le&s;&s;er Watering here we Coa&s;ted along for five Days till we came to
a great Bay, which they called <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Here we found Lakes and I&s;lands,
where landing we found nothing by Day but Woods, but in the Night we
&s;aw many Fires, and heard an innumerable noi&s;e of Drums, Trumpets,
Cymbals, and the like; wherefore being afrighted, and our South-&s;ayers
commanding us al&s;o to leave it, we Coa&s;ted <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
the burning Coa&s;t of &s;tinking Vulcano's, from whence there run out into the
Sea Rivers of Fire, and the Earth was &s;o burning hot that our Feet could
not indure it. Hence therefore we ha&s;ted and for a Days &s;ail we &s;aw all the
Land full of Fires in the Night; but in the middle of the&s;e was one va&s;tly
bigger than the re&s;t, &s;o that it &s;eem'd to touch the Stars; this, in the Day-time,
we found to be a prodigious high Mountain call'd <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
or the Chariot of the Gods, in three Days &s;ail more we pa&s;t all the fiery Ri|vers,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The rea&s;on why I have been &s;o particular in tran&s;lating the whole Story, is
becau&s;e I conceive it is an in&s;tance in Hi&s;tory &s;o con&s;iderable, e&s;pecially as to
the preceding Relation of <HI>Plato,</HI> that I can hardly believe there is a better
In&s;tance to be found. <HI>Plato</HI> tells us of the I&s;land of the <HI>Atlantis</HI> that it
was by an Earthquake &s;ome Thou&s;ands of Years before him &s;unk into the Sea,
but yet &s;o that it left many Lakes and unnavigable Places. This gives us a
<PB N="376" REF="355">
Relation of a Navigation (over the very place where the <HI>Atlantis</HI> was placed
and &s;unk by the former Relation) in the times of <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon,</HI> or &s;oon|er,
as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e; the&s;e Navigators find the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI> without the
Mouth of the Streights to trend We&s;tward almo&s;t <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> <HI>ad Occa&s;|um.
Gesner,</HI> in his Notes upon this place, &s;eems a little &s;tartled, and &s;ays, <HI>At|qui
mihi videtur ambientibus Africam omnis pa&s;t columnas Navigatio converti vel
ad Meridiem vel ad Orientem &amp; po&s;tremo ad aquilonem;</HI> not thinking, I &s;uppo&s;e,
of this Suppo&s;ition. He &s;eems al&s;o to be as much to &s;eek about the &s;ituation
of <HI>Cerne,</HI> but at la&s;t he thinks it may be the <HI>Maderas</HI> (p. 85.) which I conceive
to have lain North-we&s;tward from it, but with divers Gulphs and Bays in which
were divers great Lakes and I&s;lands, divers Mountains likewi&s;e and &s;ome
Rivers. But which is mo&s;t con&s;iderable, a great part of this I&s;land to the
South was then all on Fire. Now comparing this Relation to the pre&s;ent
State of tho&s;e parts, we find all that Continent which they pa&s;&s;ed by between
the Columns and <HI>Cerne,</HI> to be wanting, for 'twill be hard to reconcile the Re|lation
with the pre&s;ent State of that Country, &s;o in probability &s;unk and co|ver'd
with the Sea; for <HI>Cerne</HI> by this De&s;cription, lying in the &s;ame Lati|tude
with <HI>Carthage,</HI> and as far from the Pillars without as <HI>Carthage</HI> was within,
it mu&s;t have lain to the North or North-we&s;t of the <HI>Maderas,</HI> from which
place the Coa&s;t of the main Land &s;eemed then to trend South for twelve Days
Voyage as far as the <HI>Canary I&s;lands</HI> are now found, or &s;omewhat farther,
from whence it turned away to the Ea&s;tward. About the&s;e I&s;lands, I con|ceive,
was the Land that was all on Fire, multitudes of which they &s;aw in
the Night, and heard the noi&s;e of the Vulcanes, and Rivers of Fire running
into the Sea, and in &s;ome places found the Earth &s;o hot as to burn their Feet.
That which directs me the better in this Conjecture, is the prodigious <HI>Vulca|no</HI>
mention'd, called <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> the Chariot of the Gods, by rea&s;on of its
prodigious height, &s;eeming to touch the Stars. This, in all probability,
&s;eems to have been the &s;ame with the pre&s;ent <HI>Pike</HI> of <HI>Tenarif,</HI> which tho' it
burns not now, yet, yet there are pre&s;ent Evidences enough, as I have been
told by tho&s;e who have been at the top of it, to prove it to have formerly
been a <HI>Vulcano.</HI> And if they had now been wanting, yet no longer &s;ince
than <HI>Seba&s;tian Mun&s;ter</HI>'s time it was known to be &s;o, and in his Geography he
has &s;o de&s;cribed it. Be&s;ides, this by late Example, as in 1639, and by a
latter in <HI>Ferro,</HI> which I have Printed, it appears, that tho&s;e Vulcanoes are
not Strangers to tho&s;e Parts even in this Age: But I have detained you too
long with tho&s;e Conjectures, yet if all Circu&s;tances be examined in the Re|lation
of <HI>Plato</HI>'s, <HI>Atlantis,</HI> and in that of <HI>Hanno's Periplus</HI> and compar'd with
the pre&s;ent Condition of tho&s;e Parts, I conceive there will appear many Rea|sons
to make us conclude that there have been in tho&s;e parts prodigious alte|rations
&s;omewhat like tho&s;e I have &s;uppo&s;ed in my Hypothe&s;is, which may
&s;erve as an in&s;tance of Hi&s;tory for &s;uch Mutations. The next opportunity
I &s;hall produce many other, which, I conceive, will as plainly &s;peak the &s;ame
thing, according to the Mind and Intention of mo&s;t of the Ancients, and
this is to take off the odium of Novelty.</P>
<P>After the foregoing Pa&s;&s;ages quoted out of <HI>Plato</HI>'s <HI>Timaeus</HI> and the <HI>Periplus</HI>
of <HI>Hanno,</HI> I &s;hall adventure to pre&s;ent this illu&s;trious A&s;&s;embly with &s;ome of
my Conjectures at the meaning of the Fables of the Poets, but fir&s;t to &s;ay &s;ome|thing
as to that of <HI>Plato</HI> and of the <HI>Periplus,</HI> which la&s;t is &s;uppos'd by &s;everal
Authors to be very Ancient. From both tho&s;e Relations compar'd together,
there &s;eems at lea&s;t to re&s;ult a probability, that there has been &s;ome great
changes of the &s;uperficial Parts of the Earth, where $he now <HI>Atlantick</HI> O|cean
without the Streights of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> as they are now call'd, is; and then
we have certain Hi&s;tories now to prove that the main of <HI>$span$</HI> hath
extended We&s;tward beyond the $word$, and Southward as far as &s;omewhat
farther than the <HI>Canaries.</HI> I have given the Rea&s;ons why I entertain'd tho&s;e
Conjectures, which I &s;ubmit to the Judgment of &s;uch as are more knowing
and better read in Hi&s;torical Matters.</P>

<P>Hitherto he had &s;poken of things as Dead and Unactive Earth, but from
hence forth he will de&s;cribe the Earth as changed and clothed with the vari|ous
&s;hapes of Men and Per&s;ons, and &s;o having de&s;cribed the Formation or
fir&s;t Generation of all things Phy&s;ically and plainly, he comes next to tell the
Age or Ages of the World, and what Periods of Life or Being it hath had,
and the States it hath been in during tho&s;e &s;everal Periods.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Age or Chilhood of the World he calls the Golden Age: Gold
is &s;oft, flexible the mo&s;t ductile of Metals, it has the be&s;t Lu&s;tre, and has al|ways
had the greate&s;t E&s;teem. This &s;tate of the Earth he repre&s;ents to be
like that of Childhood, wherein all things are gay and plea&s;ant, all things
flow plentifully and &s;moothly; the Skin or Shell is yet &s;mooth, &s;ucculent and
&s;oft, moi&s;ture and heat abound; &s;o that things &s;prouted forth and flouri&s;h:
There is a continued Spring, all things are Budding, Blo&s;&s;oming, and bear|ing
Fruit at the &s;ame time, no need of Art as yet to help the progre&s;s of
Nature forwards; or to regulate it, no one part of Nature intrenched, in|vaded,
or hundred the free progre&s;s of another; there was plenty and e|nough,
for all Rivers flowed with Milk and Nectar, and Honey drop'd from
the Leaves of Trees.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Poetical Expre&s;&s;ions, which the Author &s;eemeth to &s;peak, as of
Men, and their Actions, and Enjoyments, I take to be &s;ignificative of all
acting Powers of the Earth whether Vegetative or Animal, <HI>Per &s;e dabar omnia
tellus, Vererat aeternum. Sponte &s;ua &s;ine lege fidem Rectumq; colebant.</HI> The Earth
gave all things of it&s;elf, Spring was Eternal, and Ju&s;tice ob&s;erv'd without
Law, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now, tho&punc; all that happened in tho&s;e times of the World, fell within the
Age which <HI>V$rro</HI> calls the <HI>Adelon Tempus;</HI> that is unknown as to the Heathen
Writers, yet I look upon this Account almo&s;t as con&s;iderable, if not more,
than tho&s;e things which fall within the Mythologick; for I take this to be
the Summe and Epitomy of the Thoughts and Theories of the mo&s;t ancient
and mo&s;t knowing Philo&s;ophers among the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> and <HI>Greeks;</HI> and howmuch
&s;oever there may be &s;ome who fllight and neglect and villify the Know|ledge,
Doctrines and Theories of the Ancients, which Humor I am apt to
think proceeds from their ignorance of what they were, and the difficulty of
attaining the knowledge of them: Yet certainly former times wanted not for
Men altogether as eminent for Knowledge, Invention, and Rea&s;oning as any
this pre&s;ent Age affords, if not far before them; for if we do believe a time
of the Creation or Production of this Earth (as we have &s;omewhat more of
Argument to per&s;uade us than po&s;&s;ibly the Heathens had from the Hi&s;tory
thereof written by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>) then 'tis very rational to conclude, that in the
more Youthful Ages of the World, there was a much greater Perfection of
the Productions of it, and that before tho&s;e many and great Alterations and
Cata&s;trophies that have &s;ince happened, and before the &s;enile Iron and de|caying
Ages of the &s;ame, wherein every thing by degrees grew more Stiff,
<PB N="379" REF="359">
Rocky, Unactive and Barren, and &s;o a degeneration of the Productions there|by
&s;eems a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equent. In the times, I &s;ay, that preceded all or
many of the&s;e, it &s;eems very rational to conclude, that it might produce
Men of much longer Life, bigger Stature, and with greater accompli&s;hments
of Mind (of all which we have very good Te&s;timonies without the Argumen|tations,
Hi&s;tories, Traditions or Theories of the Heathen Writers) upon
which account tho' this De&s;cription of the Gene&s;is of the Earth, and the fir&s;t
Age of the World &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to be but the Theory or Philo&s;ophy
of &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent Men, as <HI>Orpheus, Pythagoras,</HI> &amp;c. in Ages &s;o
much nearer to tho&s;e more active Ages of the Earth, yet, upon that ac|count,
they may, I conceive, be well worth our inquiring into, to &s;ee, at
lea&s;t, how Con&s;onant tho&s;e things are which they thought Rea&s;on, to that of
ours at this pre&s;ent. Some po&s;&s;ibly may be of <HI>Ari&s;totle's</HI> Opinion that the
Earth was eternal: But I am apt to think that &s;uch as are &s;o, have not &s;o
fully con&s;ulted their own Rea&s;on and Experience, nor much troubled them|&s;elves
with that Speculation. We found that the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Prie&s;ts by that Pa&s;|&s;age
I quoted out of <HI>Plato,</HI> had the notion of the <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> Mutations, Cata|&s;trophies,
by Fire and Water, and the like of the Earth, if we will not
allow them to have the Hi&s;tory of them, or the Accounts of &s;o many 1000 Years
as <HI>Plato</HI> mentions. But it will by &s;ome be required perhaps, by what means
can we judge of any &s;uch preceding Age? I an&s;wer, That po&s;&s;ibly the petrified
Shells that lye in the Repo&s;itory, and the prodigious Bones and Teeth that
have been found buried in the Earth, of which the Repo&s;itory affords &s;ome
in&s;tances, and more might be fetched el&s;ewhere: The&s;e, I &s;ay, might to
&s;ome unprejudiced Men prove Arguments, but for others 'tis be&s;t to let them
enjoy their own Thoughts. But to return to the Subject I was indeavouring
to prove, namely, That the Metamorpho&s;is of <HI>Ovid</HI> was a continued account
of the Ages and Times of the duration of the Earth. I &s;ay, &s;o far as I have
gone, namely, to the end of the Golden Age, none will doubt but that this
was the de&s;ign of it, to relate what were the mo&s;t celebrated Opinions con|cerning
its Formation and fir&s;t Ages, and as I conceive more particularly
that of <HI>Pythagaros,</HI> who had &s;pread and left his Doctrines in <HI>Italy</HI> long before
<HI>Ovid</HI>'s time.</P>
<P>We come next to the 313 Ver&s;e where he begins to give an account, tho'
very &s;hort, of the Youthful time of the Earth, which he calls the Silver Age.
<HI>Po&s;tquam $span$
gentea proles.</HI> After a long time was pa&s;t and buried in Ob&s;curity, the World
had got a new Face and was under the Regiment of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which &s;ignified
the <HI>Aether</HI> and <HI>Cele&s;tial Fire;</HI> before this 'tis &s;aid in the Golden or infant Age
of the World, <HI>Ver $word$ at aeternum; $span$
natos &s;ine &s;emine flores.</HI> The Air and Earth was moi&s;t and tepid, which made
a continual Spring, but now that $word$ is dried up, and $word$ heat and
drine&s;s is got into the Air. $span$
This ingre&s;s of <HI>Jupiter</HI> cau&s;ed tho&s;e &s;trange changes in
the Air, that we in part now feel; for 'tis not immediately the heat of the
Sun that makes that difference in the heat of the Air, tho' that be al&s;o a
Cau&s;e. But as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to treat in an other place 'tis the Con&s;ti|tution
of the Air, nor is it the oblique Radiation (is all which one con&s;ent af|firme)
nor the nearne&s;s to, or di&s;tance from the Sun, but it is the ingre&s;s of
<HI>Jupiter</HI> that makes the Air &s;u&s;ceptible of the&s;e Mutations. <HI>$span$
fervoribus u&s;tus canduit,</HI> &amp;c. then entered lightening and extraordinary
Heats; and &s;o he proceeds in the de&s;cription of the other Sea&s;ons and Con|&s;titutions
of Air, <HI>Semma tum primam long is $span$</HI>
The Earth being now dried having lo&s;t much of its Infant &s;oftne&s;s and moi|&s;ture,
needed &s;ome helps to make the Seeds grow. After this iuvenile Age
was pa&s;t over, then <HI>$span$
ridaq prompior arma, non Sec$er at a tamer.</HI> All the afore&s;aid Qualities increa&s;ed, the
Earth growing drier and drier, and the Air more intmperate, but yet it pro|duced
no direful Effects of terraneous or aerial Cata&s;trophies. But <HI>De $word$
e&s;t ultima ferro.</HI> Now the Shell of the Earth is Petrified, and the Iron Con|&s;titution
<PB N="381" REF="360">
is introduced, all its Rocks and Iron Mines. <HI>Protinus Erupit venae
pejoris in aevum omne Nefas.</HI> Then followed all the di&s;mal effects of Subterraneous
and Superterraneous Di&s;&s;entions, Conflagrations, Floods, Earthquakes,
the Sea overwhelming the Lands, and the Lands getting out from under the Seas,
here I&s;lands, there Lakes, here Mountains, there Voragoes and Aby&s;&s;es, and
multitudes of other Confu&s;ions which ra&s;ed and mangled the &s;uperficial Parts
of the Earth, &s;o that no place was free from the effects of the&s;e di&s;cordant
Principles. <HI>A&s;trea,</HI> as I &s;aid before, which &s;ignified the Virgin, <HI>Juvenile</HI>
&s;mooth, &s;oft, and even Face and Con&s;titution of the Earth which it fir&s;t re|ceived
from the gentle Influence of the Heavens, and pre&s;erved in the In|fant,
<HI>Juvenile</HI> and pretty well in the Virile or brazen Ages. Now, that
the Earth was arrived to its old Age, Wrinkles, Chops, Furrows, Scarrs,
and the like, had not left one &s;pot of <HI>A&s;trea</HI> unblemi&s;h'd, then &s;he is &s;aid to
have left it. This is a &s;hort account of this Iron or old Age of the World,
of which I &s;uppo&s;e the whole following Metamorpho&s;is is written; this in
good part falling within the Mythologick Hi&s;tory of the Poets, but the Ge|ne&s;is
and three preceding Ages, I look upon to belong to <HI>Varroe's <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
tempus,</HI> and to be the Epitome of the Theories of the mo&s;t antient and mo&s;t
approv'd Philo&s;ophers. This I could in part prove, as I could al&s;o many o|ther
Pa&s;&s;ages of this Di&s;cour&s;e, by Quotations out of other Authors among
the Antient, and al&s;o by the con&s;ent of many more Modern Writers. But
that po&s;&s;ibly might &s;eem too tedious, and I doubt not but there are others
who having more applied their Studies that way will do it more fully. The
fir&s;t of the memorable events of the Iron or old Age of the World is de&s;cribed
in the next following Ver&s;es.</P>
<LG>

<L>Mountains they rais'd' gain&s;t the aetherial Throne.</L>
</LG>
<P>Now the di&s;mal effects of the old Age of the Earth appear, the outward
Shell of the Earth being now hardned and petrified, and the Pores of Ema|nation
&s;toped &s;o that the fiery and watery Vapours and Rarefactions below
the &s;ame, could not now find their u&s;ual tran&s;its; the&s;e are &s;aid to con&s;pire
again&s;t Heaven to break out of that Pri&s;on of <HI>Tartarus,</HI> where <HI>Jupiter</HI> had
lately thru&s;t down and inclo&s;ed <HI>Saturn, Saturno tenebro$$ in tartara mi&s;&s;o,</HI> and
to force their Pa&s;&s;age into the open Heaven, where <HI>Jupiter</HI> now prevails;
the&s;e therefore fermenting together had rai&s;ed the &s;ubterraneous Parts into
many Cavities and <HI>Cryptae,</HI> and therefore were &s;aid to have a thou&s;and Hands,
being &s;o many Caverns and far extending <HI>Cryptae,</HI> wherein the&s;e &s;ubterrane|ous
Sprits convened, in which lay their &s;trength; and becau&s;e &s;uch <HI>Cryptae,</HI> are
winding and not &s;treight, they were called <HI>Anguipedes</HI> like Snakes; the&s;e at
la&s;t break forth and make Mountains, lay <HI>Pelion</HI> upon <HI>O&s;&s;a, Alta&abque; conge&s;tos
&s;truxere ad &s;idera montes.</HI> Then <HI>Jupiter</HI> is &s;aid to have rent the Heavens with
his Lightning and to have buried them at la&s;t with Mountains heaped on
them; that is, the&s;e Vapours having made Eruptions and thereby carried
the Earth up with them, &s;o as to make Mountains one of the top of the
other, the Vapour got into the Air where it produced hideous Lightning and
&s;o &s;pent it &s;elf in the Air, and the Mountains being left, and the Vapours
that rai&s;ed them &s;pent, <HI>Jupiter</HI> is &s;aid to have de&s;troyed them and buried
them under tho&s;e Mountains: One of the&s;e is &s;aid to be buried under <HI>Sicily,</HI>
and to breath through the Mountain <HI>Aetna.</HI> But I mu&s;t not &s;tay too long
upon the particular Explication of every thing concerning it, it may be &s;uffi|cient
for me at pre&s;ent to hint the meaning in general; only 'tis to be noted,
that the Blood of the&s;e produced a generation that was of the &s;ame kind;
that is, that the remainders in the Earth were of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="361">
The&s;e remainders of the fir&s;t Effects were &s;o prodigious that they made
<HI>Jupiter</HI> groan and grow white hot with Anger, that is, made Thunder and
Lightning, and call a Council of the Gods,</P>

this Mythologick Hi&s;tory was a Hi&s;tory of the Production, Ages, States and
Changes that have formerly happened to the Earth, partly from the Theory
of the be&s;t Philo&s;ophy; partly from Tradition, whether Oral or Written,
and partly from undoubted Hi&s;tory, for towards the latter end we find ac|counts
of many things our Hi&s;tories reach, as <HI>Orpheus,</HI> the <HI>Trojan</HI> War, <HI>Py|thagoras,

<DIV2>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>IN An&s;wer to your Que&s;tion about the word</HI> Rephaim <HI>and</HI> Gigantes, <HI>I make
this &s;hort return.</HI></P>
<P>1. There is no rudical word in the Hebrew Language who&s;e &s;ignification doth at all
lead us to under&s;tand <HI>Gigantes</HI> by the word <HI>Rephaim,</HI> &s;o, that the Radix of <HI>Re|phaim</HI>
is either lo&s;t as to the pre&s;ent Hebrew Language (as many others are) or el&s;e
that word <HI>Rephaim</HI> is a foreign word to that Language, as many more &s;uch are now
found in the Bible.</P>
<P>2. The Septuagint Tran&s;lators do often render Hebrew words not according to their
Natural Sen&s;e, but with re&s;pect to &s;ome Hi&s;tory or Tradition, or general belief pre|vailing
at that time: The rea&s;on was becau&s;e tho&s;e Tran&s;lators lived among Greeks
at <HI>Alexandria:</HI> And they were de&s;irous to &s;hew that the Bible was not unaquainted
with the Greek Stories, where the thing could be done without injury to their Books.</P>
<P>3. In their rendring of the word <HI>Rephaim</HI> by <HI>Gigantes</HI> and <HI>Mortui,</HI> and the
Verb&mdash;they plainly point at the Story of the <HI>Titanes,</HI> who in the Greek
Mythologies are &s;aid <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> St. <HI>Jude</HI> u&s;es the &s;ame word when he &s;peaketh
of the Helli&s;h Angels, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Another Greek Tran&s;lator rendereth the
&s;ame word Rephaim by Titanes.</P>
<P>4. As to the &s;u&s;picion that the <HI>Gigantomachia</HI> was an Earthquake, or perhaps &s;e|veral
Earthquakes, but by the Poets put altogether, the true notation of the word
<HI>Gigas</HI> &s;eems to make for you. In Hebrew the <HI>Radix Gaga&s;h,</HI> is <HI>terra commota
fuit.</HI> And the Sub&s;tantive <HI>Gigas,</HI> tho' commonly taken for a Greeks word, is indeed
of Hebrew or Phaenician. Original. In that place of <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> where the 70 u&s;e <HI>Gi|gantes,
Symmachus</HI> u&s;es <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, both alluding to the Poetical Fable, but the
70 do it more warily, <HI>Symmachus</HI> more plainly.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="364">
But to me I confe&s;s it &s;eems rather to allude to the fourth Ver&s;e of the
&s;ixth Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> where it is &s;aid, that there were Giants in the Earth
in tho&s;e Days, becau&s;e the word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> is made u&s;e of by the Septua|gint
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and it &s;eems to be a full
Period, be&s;ides we find that God immediately after this Pa&s;&s;age, is &s;aid to be
very highly di&s;plea&s;ed with the wickedne&s;s of Mankind at that time upon
the Earth, and to re&s;olve their De&s;truction and Extirpation, which &s;hews
that there is a great agreement of the Poets Mythology with this Hi&s;tory of
<HI>Mo&s;es:</HI> For <HI>Ovid</HI> makes this <HI>Gigantomachia</HI> to precede the Flood of <HI>Deuca|lion,</HI>
as the Scripture doth make this to precede that of <HI>Noah.</HI> And be&s;ides
joins the Fable of <HI>Lycaon</HI> to that of his Giants, which &s;eems plainly to al|lude
to the wickedne&s;s of Men mentioned by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> upon this occa&s;ion. Fur|ther,
I do not know whether the word may not &s;ometime have been u&s;ed to
denominate Earthquakes, or &s;ubterraneous Powers; for in the ninth Ver&s;e of
the fourteenth of <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> where the &s;ame word is u&s;ed by the &s;eventy. It
&s;eems plainly to &s;ignify &s;ome &s;uch thing; but this is be&s;ides my Province,
and I &s;hall rather leave it to the Divines to determine: For <HI>Gigas</HI> is the &s;ame
word with the Greek word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, which <HI>Eu&s;tachius</HI> derives from <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
that is an Off-&s;pring or Progeny of the Earth, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;omewhat generated in
the Bowels or Womb of the Earth and thence Born, brought forth or pro|truded,
which is a very proper Appellation and De&s;cription of that pro|duction
of Nature, wherewith the Earth &s;eems to be fir&s;t impregnated and
made tame, then to be in great Agony and Pangs, and to have many pangs
and throws before it is delivered of it; and la&s;t of all to produce I&s;lands,
Mountains, or the like Mon&s;ters, which &s;eem to threaten or a&s;pire at the
Cele&s;tial Man&s;ions.</P>
<P>When I gave an account the preceding Meeting, <HI>July</HI> the thirteenth, of
what I conceived the Poets meant by the Mythology of the Giants warring with
the Gods, &s;ome of the Society then pre&s;ent were very Inqui&s;itive to be in|formed
what &s;hould be meant by the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Python</HI> which was de&s;troy'd by
<HI>Apollo,</HI> of which though I had made &s;ome mention in a former Di&s;cour&s;e con|cerning
the Mythology mention'd by <HI>Ovid,</HI> yet being then only mention'd
<HI>in tran&s;itu,</HI> I have now &s;omewhat more particularly drawn up my Sentiment
concerning it. I mention'd before then <HI>Ovid</HI> by this Mythology (as I con|ceived)
did de&s;ign to de&s;cribe the &s;tate of the Earth from its fir&s;t beginning and
formation out of a <HI>Chaos,</HI> through all the various Alterations, Changes and
Metamorpho&s;es it had undergon even to that time in which he lived. And
therein to compri&s;e the Traditions and Opinions of the Antients, and po&s;&s;ibly
al&s;o &s;ome of the Moderns of his Times, and &s;ome al&s;o of his own, thereby
to give &s;ome Account and &s;ome Rea&s;ons of the then pre&s;ent Phaenomena of
the World. I need not repeat what I have formerly in&s;tanced in, about the
<HI>Chaos</HI> and the Ages &s;ucceeding, nor what I &s;aid concerning the Fable of the
<HI>Giants:</HI> But to make the probability of my Conjectures the more manife&s;t, I
would ob&s;erve to you the Co-haerence and Connexion of the Mythologies, as
they are ranged in this fir&s;t Book. After the War of the <HI>Giants</HI> which had
rai&s;ed up Mountains that &s;eemed to threaten the very Heavens by their height,
and the di&s;turbances that had thereby been cau&s;ed in the Air by Lightning
and Storms which he makes to be the means by which the Gods de&s;troy'd
their fury, he comes to con&s;ider the Face of the Earth as it was left, which
he Mythologizes by the Story of <HI>Lycaon,</HI> whereby he de&s;cribes the confu&s;ion
there was left by the &s;ubver&s;ion, &s;inking, overwhelming and de&s;tructions that
had been made, the <HI>Ru&s;tica Numina</HI> as the <HI>Fauri, Nymphae, Satyri,</HI> and the <HI>Syl|vani</HI>
of the Mountains, were all likely to be de&s;troyed for the future; that is,
the fine Plains, the Woods, the Rivers and Rivulets, the Woods on the Hills
were all deformed, confounded, and put into confu&s;ion, and not only &s;o but
the Air it&s;elf was from the Clefts and Cha&s;ms poi&s;oned and continually filled with
noxious, Expirations out of the Earth, the People remaining were di|&s;tracted
and grown barbarous, preying upon and de&s;troying one another; it
was thought therefore by <HI>Jupiter,</HI> i. e. Divine Power, nece&s;&s;ary, that all mu&s;t
be &s;et to rights again by a general Deluge, whereupon the Poet brings in <HI>Jupiter</HI>
Swearing,</P>

&s;hould be filled, the ruggedne&s;&s;es plain'd, the &s;uperficial Parts, now Rocks and

&s;oft, and fine, and fatter Skin of Earth, which &s;hould be fit to produce and
nouri&s;h Vegetables and Animals as before. The Poet then de&s;cribes the
Flood, and thereby makes all Men and other Creatures to peri&s;h by it, ex|cept
only <HI>Deucalion</HI> and <HI>Pyrrha,</HI> who were to be the re&s;torers of Mankind,

will &s;ee by and by; but Man only by propagation, yet his method of Pro|pagation
looks at fir&s;t glance but very extravagant, namely, from Stones

&s;ays <HI>Ovid;</HI> and I am very apt to think that <HI>Ovid</HI> him&s;elf was one of the
Unbelievers, notwithstanding the Te&s;timony of the old Traditions, that is,
that he did not take it to be a truth in the plain Sen&s;e of the Words, tho'
he &s;eems to draw a Con&s;equence from them. [<HI>Inde genus durum &s;umus experien&s;&abque;
Laborum.</HI>] But that he under&s;tood what was meant or intended to be &s;igni|fied
by this Mythologick De&s;cription [<HI>Et Document a damus qua &s;umus origine na|ti.</HI>]
But to proceed. After he has told us how Mankind was pre&s;erved and
propagated after the Deluge, he next comes to the other Creatures.</P>

him literally, or according to the words, <HI>Quippe ubi temperiem Sump&s;ere
Humor&abque; calor&abque; concipiunt &amp; ab his oriuntur cuncta duobus.</HI> All came from two
Principles; for he &s;eems to make all things to ari&s;e or be generated out of a
temperature of Heat and Moi&s;ture, and by that means the Earth, when left
by the Deluge, abounding with muddy and boggy Places the heat of the Sun
working thereupon produced, according to him, not only all the &s;everal
Creatures a new which had been lo&s;t and de&s;troyed by the Deluge, but di|vers
others of &s;trange,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fables of <HI>Python</HI> ex|$$$$$</NOTE> and before unknown, and mon&s;trous Forms, which
were terrible and de&s;tructive to Mankind, and among&s;t the re&s;t he mentions
a &s;trange, venomous and prodigious <HI>Serpent,</HI> which he calls <HI>Python,</HI> which he
<PB N="387" REF="366">

no more is meant, but that tho&s;e boggy Places after a time corrupted and
produced pe&s;tilential, dark, Clouds and Vapours, which frighted and was noxi|ous

<P>But that in &s;ome time after the Rays of the Sun and Lightning having
prevailed, did thereby burn off and di&s;charge the poi&s;onous Exhalations, and
put an end to that mon&s;trous off-&s;pring, nor need we be much concerned for
what the <HI>Daemonologers</HI> had thereupon &s;uper&s;tructed for the promoting and
carrying on of their <HI>Theourgy.</HI> After this drying of the boggy places of the

Re&s;idence by the <HI>Sun or Jupiter,</HI> is &s;aid out of jealou&s;y to &s;et <HI>Argus,</HI> that is,
the Stars to watch it by Night and cau&s;e it to fall: But <HI>Mercury,</HI> or the light
of the Morning cuts off the head of <HI>Argus,</HI> that is, makes the Stars di&s;ap|pear
and the Sun return to rai&s;e them, and <HI>Io</HI> is then re&s;tored to her former
Shape, or the Dew or Moi&s;ture on the Ground is rai&s;ed into Vapours. By
the bye he in&s;erts the Generation of Water, and River-plants by <HI>Syrinx,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Syrinx.</NOTE> and
the production of the <HI>Rain-bow</HI> by the Head of <HI>Argus,</HI> placed by <HI>Juno</HI> or the
power of the Air in the Feathers of <HI>Juno</HI>'s Bird, which are the Clouds of the
Air. By the&s;e Mythologies having de&s;cribed the po&s;tdiluvian &s;tate of the
Waters, and the Air and watery Meteors, he ends the Book with the Pedi|gree
of <HI>Phaeton</HI> which he compleats in the beginning of the next, of which
hereafter.</P>
<P>But as to <HI>Python,</HI> which gave the occa&s;ion of my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pytkon.</NOTE> 'tis
plain that its Name &s;ignifies Corruption, and by the manner of its Genera|tion,
'tis evident that he &s;uppo&s;es this Corruption to be cau&s;ed by the Bog|gine&s;s
or Floods that remained in the Plains, Lakes, or Holes, lower
Grounds or Vales incompa&s;&s;ed with higher Grounds that the Water could
not run off: From the fermentation of the &s;oftned Earth he &s;up|po&s;es
the Animals to be formed that were of the &s;ame form with the <HI>Ante|diluvian;</HI>
but from a longer &s;tay of the Waters this fermentation turned to
Corruption, and then produced not only Mon&s;trous Creatures, but noxious
and dreadful Exhalations, whence proceeded Di&s;tempers and Di&s;ea&s;es,
becau&s;e the&s;e Waters by &s;everal Streams moved (as mo&s;t commonly they do)
to lower Places and Cavities and there made a great Body which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a
con&s;iderable part of the incompa&s;&s;ing Hills or Mountains: <HI>Apollo or Jupiter,</HI>
that is, the Sun by many Days and Years irradiating with its Darts, Rays or
Beams, doth partly dry by Exhalations, partly by fla&s;hes of Lightning, di&s;|&s;ipate,
and di&s;pel, and la&s;t of all it cau&s;eth Clefts and openings of the Earth
which &s;wallow it up, and leave tho&s;e Cavities like the black Wounds which the
Post affirms to remain for a witne&s;s to Po&s;terity.</P>

<P>To this purpo&s;e there is a notable Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Lucian,</HI> which, among others,
to another intent, is quoted by Dr. <HI>Burnet, Theor. Sacr.</HI> Part 2. Chap. 4. &startq;The&s;e
are the Matters (&s;ays <HI>Lucian</HI>) which the Greeks have related concerning
the Flood of <HI>Deucalion.</HI> But among the things that have happened &s;oon af|ter
it, there is a certain relation of the Inhabitants of <HI>Hieraep$$l$$,</HI> which is
ju&s;tly looked upon with great admiration, namely, that in their Country
there had happened to be made a great Cha&s;me in the Earth, which had
&s;wallowed up all the remaining Waters; whereupon <HI>Deucalion</HI> had built Al|tars
and a Temple dedicated to <HI>Juno</HI> over the <HI>fame.</HI> Now for a &s;ign that
this Relation is &s;o, they do thus twice every Year, Water is brought from the
Sea to this Temple, and not only the Prie&s;ts bring it, but all <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>A|rabia,</HI>
and many which dwell beyond the $uphrates, go to the Sea and fetch|ing
the Water from hence bring it to this place: And fir&s;t indeed
they pour it out into the Temple, and then it runs into the Cha&s;m, and tho'
this Cha&s;m be but &s;mall, yet it &s;wallows an immense quantity of Water.
When they perform this Ceremony, they &s;iv that De$calun in&s;tituted this
Rite and Law of this Temple, that it might be a Memorial as well of the
De&s;truction by as of the Deliverance and Safety procured again&s;t the Flood.
This (&s;ays <HI>Lucian</HI>) is the old Story concerning this Temple.&endq; This Tradi|tion
'tis very probable, <HI>Ovid</HI> was not ignorant of and might therefore add to
his Relation <HI>Fu&s;o per vulnera nigra veneno. Nerve operts famam po&s;&s;et del$$e vetusta.</HI> And 'tis very probable also that the Mythology of <HI>Argns</HI> has a respect to the
Generation of the Rainbow &s;oon after the Flood as it is mentioned by <HI>$word$</HI>

<P>I have formerly di&s;cour&s;ed concerning the great and &s;trange Effects that
have been produced on the &s;uperficial Parts of the Earth by means of Earth|quakes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The occa&s;ion of this Lecture.</NOTE>
the rai&s;ing of Hills, the &s;inking of Vallies and Lakes, the &s;wallow|ing
and new producing of Rivers, the rai&s;ing and &s;inking of I&s;lands, the
cleaving of Hills and Rocks, and the tumbling and di&s;ordering of the &s;uper|ficial
Parts of the Earth, by which means have been produced the Veins and
various mixtures in Marbles and other kinds of Stone, and mo&s;t of the pe|trifactive
Productions, be&s;ides the Production of Mines and Metalline Bodies,
as well as of other Saline, Sulphureous and divers other mineral Sub&s;tances.
And in &s;hort I conceive that the whole Surface of the Earth, as it is at pre|&s;ent,
has been &s;ome ways or other influenced and &s;haped by them: I have on
&s;everal occa&s;ions alledged &s;everal Arguments and Ob&s;ervations to make the&s;e
Conceptions probable, and have produced &s;everal Hi&s;tories that &s;eem
to be that way conducing. But mo&s;t of the greate&s;t Mutations having in
probability been performed in the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> the uncertain or
fabulous Times, as they are termed by <HI>Varro,</HI> there is not to be found in the
Hi&s;torical time very many that do make much for it; the greate&s;t In&s;tance I
conceive to be had of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the <HI>Egyp|tians</HI> had Re|cords of <HI>Phae|ton</HI> in their Histories.</NOTE> is the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Phaeton,</HI> which, tho' among the

of <HI>Plato</HI> which he relates concerning what <HI>Solon</HI> had learned from the <HI>Aegypti|an
Prei&s;t</HI> that the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> had Records thereof in their Hi&s;tory, as in
probability they had of many others, of which the <HI>Grecians</HI> were wholly igno|rant,
as may in part appear by the Relation of the <HI>Atlantis;</HI> for the <HI>Greeks</HI>
had nothing of Hi&s;tory elder than the Flood of <HI>Oygges,</HI> which, as <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI>
&s;ays, happened about the times of <HI>Jacob,</HI> which was long after that of <HI>Noah,</HI>
and long before that of <HI>Deucalion,</HI> which was about the latter end of <HI>Mo&s;es's</HI>
Life. All which time according to <HI>Varro,</HI> and many hundred Years after e|ven
to the beginning of the <HI>Olympiads</HI> (which was but 776 Years before
Chri&s;t) was included in the Fabulous Age, which was likewi&s;e 776 Years after
<HI>Mo&s;es</HI> his Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At what time that happened.</NOTE> he dying in the 1552 Year before Chri&s;t's Nativity; within
which space of time the Catastrophy Mythologised by the Story of <HI>Phaeton</HI>
&s;eems to have happened; for <HI>Oro&s;ius</HI> relates it to have been much about the
time of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> departure out of <HI>Aegypt;</HI> as he doth al&s;o a&s;&s;ert that of
<HI>Deucalion</HI>'s Flood, in which the greate&s;t part of the People of <HI>The&s;&s;aly</HI> were
lo&s;t, only &s;ome few e&s;caping who fled to the Mountains, e&s;pecially <HI>Parna&s;&s;us,</HI>
near the Foot of which <HI>Deucalion</HI> then reigned. Now if we con&s;ider the Story
as it is related by <HI>Ovid</HI> in the &s;econd Book of his <HI>Metamorpho&s;is,</HI> making al|lowance
for what is Poetically &s;poken, one may plainly enough from the
whole drift of the Fable conjecture at the Hi&s;tory or Tradition that is couch|ed
under it, as well as &s;omewhat al&s;o of the Philo&s;ophy; as for the morality
thereof enough have taken notice of and writ concerning it. As for the time
of it, <HI>Ovid</HI> places it &s;oon after the Fable of <HI>Deucalion</HI> which is the &s;eventh
Fable of his fir&s;t Book; and the eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelvth, are of
Matters con&s;equential of that Flood which mu&s;t have followed it in a very
&s;hort time (as I may on &s;ome other occa&s;ion make more probable) or rather
praevious to this, as being indeed part of it. But to let that pa&s;s for the pre|&s;ent,
I &s;hall only take notice now of the Phy&s;ical or Philo&s;ophical part thereof,
which to me &s;eems to contain a De&s;cription of &s;ome very great Earthquake
or fiery Eruption which affected a great part of the World then known.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then we find <HI>Phaeton</HI> to be termed a Son or production of the Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Explication of the Fable of <HI>Phaeton.</HI></NOTE>

undertaking more than what it was able or fit to perform and manage, yet
it is &s;o ordered as to compri&s;e the main De&s;ign and Phy&s;ical meaning of the
Poet, <HI>viz.</HI> that by &s;ome extraordinary or univer&s;al influence of the Suns
Beams the Subterraneous Vapours had been kindled, and that a fore-runner
of this was Lightning and Thunderings in the Air, which &s;eems to be expre&s;|&s;ed

<P>The Managery and Cour&s;e of the Hor&s;es and Chariots through the Hea|vens
is all poetical, accommodated to &s;hew the Con&s;tellations of <HI>Aratus,</HI> and to
the Co&s;mography of the Poets, to &s;ignify the concurrence of the other Ce|le&s;tial
Bodies and Powers: But the effects it produced on the Earth as the
flaming and burning of Mountains, the cleaving and chopping of the Earth,
the &s;wallowing up of Rivers, the ri&s;ing of Lands out of the Sea, as e&s;pecial|ly
that about <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and the Sandy De&s;erts on the We&s;t &s;ide of it, &s;eem to
be Hi&s;torical as well as Poetical.</P>
<P>But I confe&s;s the whole is &s;o Poetical that much certainty of Hi&s;tory cannot
be fetched out of it; yet for the pre&s;ent let me add thus much that I conceive
may be deduced therefrom, and that is this, That there was an ancient Tra|dition
among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and that there was an ancient Hi&s;tory among the
<HI>Aegyytians</HI> of &s;ome very great and almo&s;t general Conflagration or Eruption
of fiery Streams which made very great Deva&s;tations on the Earth, e&s;peci|ally
of tho&s;e parts mentioned by the Poet in this Relation; &s;uch as <HI>Athos,
Ida, Oete, Tmolus, Taurus, Helicon, Aemus, Aetna, Parna&s;&s;us, Othry, $word$,
Erix, Mimas, Rhodope, Dindyma, Cauca&s;us, Mycale, Cytheron, Dindus ad Ossa,
Olympus,</HI> the <HI>Alpes</HI> and <HI>Appenine,</HI> all which Mountains, are &s;aid to have been
on Fire, and to have ca&s;t up Smoak, A&s;hes, and burning Coles, and to have
thickned and darkned the Air.</P>

<P>Then were ca&s;t up the <HI>Libyan</HI> De&s;arts and many Lakes and Rivers &s;wallow|ed
up and perverted, the names of which the Poet mentions, which are too
many now to repeat; then the other parts of the Earth were cleft and tumbl|ed
to and fro.</P>

<P>Then was the Sea contracted into a narrower but deeper Ce&s;tern, the Hills
and Lands on each &s;ide of it rai&s;ed from under the former Sea and made dry
Lands and Mountains, the I&s;lands that are now di&s;per&s;ed in it were thru&s;t up
out of its bottom, and &s;tand in that Po&s;ition to this time: In &s;hort not to de|tain
you at pre&s;ent too long upon this Mythologick Story, I conceive it to
contain the Hi&s;tory or <HI>Cabala</HI> of the Production or Birth of the pre&s;ent <HI>Me|diterranean,
Aegean</HI> and <HI>Euxine</HI> Seas, and of all the bordering Shores and
Countries near adjacent to them, together with all the I&s;lands, Penin&s;ula's,
Cliffs Promontories, Mountains, Hills, Lakes, Rivers and Countries which
had been before that time all covered with the Sea, but by a prodigious Ca|ta&s;trophy
which Divine Providence then cau&s;ed to be effected, the former
Face of tho&s;e Parts was transformed and metamorpho&s;ed into much what it is
now found, in General, tho' not in all Particulars; for that there may have
&s;ince been by the &s;ame Divine Providence produced other particular Cata|&s;trophies
and Mutations, of which there are many In&s;tances mythologically
Recorded in this our Author, &s;ome of which I have already mentioned, and
divers others which I may have occa&s;ion to mention &s;ome other time, be|&s;ides
divers others of which we have plain and not hitherto doubted or di&s;puted
Hi&s;tories. Now, tho' I confe&s;s what I have here a&s;&s;erted to be &s;eemingly ve|ry
Extravagant and Heterodox from the general Conceptions of mo&s;t that
have had occa&s;ion to mention this Fable; and tho' it had been le&s;s impro|bable,
I &s;hould not have expected any Concurrence of Opinion: Yet po&s;&s;ibly
when the Matter has beeen more &s;edately and without prejudice thought of
and examined, it may, as well as &s;ome of my former Extravagancies, receive
at lea&s;t a more mild Cen&s;ure, tho' it &s;hould not be wholly accommodated to
the Gu&s;to of every &s;uch Examinant. In the&s;e Matters Geometrical Cogen|cy
has not yet been applied, and where that is wanting, Opinion, which is
always various and un&s;table, prevails. However, I may on &s;ome other oc|ca&s;ion
&s;hew that there is to be found in Phy&s;ick, as well as Geometry, unan|werable Probation.</P>
<P>And when the Extravagancy and Novelty of the Doctrine has run the
Gauntlet of Cen&s;ures, I &s;hall indeavour to add &s;omewhat to cover and cure its
Scars.</P>
<P>I did the la&s;t day indeavour to &s;hew what I conceived was veiled by the Poet
under the Story of <HI>Phaeton,</HI> and that was this, That by this Mythology the
<HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Poets did pre&s;erve the memory of &s;ome extraordinary great
Cata&s;trophy, which all the parts of the Earth or Countries not far removed
from the <HI>Mediterranean, Aegean, Euxine,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Seas had &s;uffered by fiery
Eruptions or Meteors, effecting Earthquakes.</P>
<P>This to me &s;eems probable from the Order and from the Manner of the
whole Relation.</P>
<P>For the Order of it; we find it placed by <HI>Ovid</HI> &s;oon after the Flood of
<HI>Deucalion,</HI> and &s;o we find it is related by <HI>Paulus Oro&s;ius</HI> (which I hinted the la&s;t
day) for in the ninth and tenth Chap. of his fir&s;t Book of Hi&s;torys he makes
the Flood of <HI>Deucalion</HI> to have happened much about the time of the Plagues
of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and the Pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> through the Red Sea, by which
Flood the greate&s;t part of the People of <HI>The&s;&s;aly</HI> were de&s;troyed. <HI>Quo</HI> (&s;ays
<HI>Oro&s;ius,</HI> &s;peaking of that Flood) <HI>Major pars populorurm The&s;&s;aliae ab&s;umpta e&s;t,

tulerit. Ex quo etiam quidam, dum non concedunt Deo ineffabilem potentiam &s;uam,
Inanes Ratiunculas conquirentes Ridiculam Phaetontis Fabulam texuerunt.</HI> Thus
far he, by which it &s;eems that <HI>Oro&s;ius</HI> did, in the Stories of <HI>Deucalion</HI> and <HI>Phae|ton</HI>
for the main, believe the Matters of Fact to be true, but he was not for
giving a Philo&s;ophical Conjecture at the Cau&s;es of it, or the a&s;cribing them
to the Pagan Deities, but for a&s;cribing it immediately to the ineffable Power
of God.</P>
<P>Now I do not conceive it doth any ways detract from the Omnipotency and
Power of God, to explain the Cau&s;es that he was plea&s;ed to make praevi|ous
to tho&s;e Effects: For the Power of God is not le&s;s wonderful, in pro|ducing
and di&s;po&s;ing the Cau&s;es of things, than in producing the things more
immediately. But &s;uch a Story as this Fable of <HI>Phaeton</HI> is, and to give &s;uch an ac|count
of its Cau&s;es, as the Poets have there given, if under&s;tood literally, &s;eems
&s;ufficiently ridiculous, and impious. But it is ea&s;y enough to be &s;een that
tho&s;e who made this Fable knew better things, and only made u&s;e of Mytho|logy
to conceale their knowledge from the Vulgar, and yet communicate it to
&s;uch as had the Key to unfold the My&s;tery contained therein.</P>
<P>And this appears plain enough from the whole &s;eries al&s;o of the Hi&s;tory;
for as I noted before, <HI>Phaeton</HI> is &s;aid to be produced or generated by the Sun
in the Womb of <HI>Clymene,</HI> an Epithite of <HI>Pluto,</HI> that is, in the Subterraneous Re|gions;
and that it is &s;o under&s;tood, appears plainly by the behaviour of <HI>Cly|mene,</HI>
who is &s;aid, after the Death of her Son, to have been <HI>Lugubris
&amp; amens, &amp; Laniata Sinus totum percen&s;uit orbem, exanime&s;&abque; Artus primo, mox
o&s;&s;a requirens.</HI> Which &s;eems to denote the murmuring and tumbling in the
Earth that continued after the Conflagration was over, and the Story of the
Si&s;ters of <HI>Phaeton</HI> &s;eems very con&s;onant al&s;o thereunto if I had time now to
con&s;ider them.</P>
<P><HI>Phaeton</HI> being grown to maturity, is &s;aid to have a great de&s;ire to know his
Father, whom <HI>Clymene</HI> directs to go to the Palace of the Sun; that is, the
Vapours being copiou&s;ly generated in the Earth are expelled into the Air a&s;|cending
towards the Sun. <HI>Phaeton</HI> is &s;aid to have come at length to the Pa|lace
of the Sun, and there to have been much plea&s;ed with the glorious work
thereof, and more e&s;pecially with the Workman&s;hip of <HI>Vulcan</HI> in the Gates.

this, That the &s;tate of the World before this Cata&s;trophy was much the
&s;ame (<HI>facies nou omnibus una, nec diver&s;a tamen</HI>) with the State of it after|wards;
that is, the Cour&s;e of the Sun was through the twelve Signs; there
was a Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter, as there has been &s;ince; no alte|ration
of the Axis or obliquity of the Ecliptick: But there were Ages, and
Years, and Months, and Days, and Hours as now; and <HI>Phaebus</HI> de&s;cribing
the way to drive his Chariot through, doth name the &s;ame Con&s;tellations:
So that the Philo&s;ophers who made the Theory, or the Poets that made the
Fable, did not under&s;tand or &s;uppo&s;e the obliquity of the Ecliptick to be made
by that Deviation of the Chariot, or that this Cata&s;trophy had altered the
Axis of the Earth, with re&s;pect to the Heavens. But neither did they
de&s;ign to &s;ignify, even by this Story, the Deviation of the Sun it &s;elf at that
time, as if that had de&s;cended and fired the Earth: For <HI>Phaebus</HI> did not ac|company
the Chariot, <HI>Occupat ille levem juvenili corpore currum,</HI> v. 150. But
<PB N="393" REF="372">
they rather &s;eem to make <HI>Phaeton</HI> a fiery Meteor proceeding from the Ea&s;t,
and moving We&s;tward by another way and cour&s;e than the Sun u&s;ually took,
and differing from the Direction that <HI>Phaebus</HI> had given to <HI>Phaeton</HI> to ob&s;erve:
But his Hor&s;es now mounted upwards towards the fixt Stars, now down|wards
towards the Earth, now far to the North, then as much to the South;
and la&s;t of all he was broak all to peices by Lightning, and fell down like a
Meteor upon the Earth, and like &s;ome &s;uch Meteors as have of late Years
been ob&s;erved, but much greater. <HI>At Phaeton, Rutilos flamma populante capil|los,

been any &s;uch Comet as in its Cour&s;e might come &s;o near the Earth as to &s;et

and Nitrous Minerals, or whether it were &s;ome Exhalation collect|ed

might &s;eem to pa&s;s near tho&s;e Con&s;tellations, through which <HI>Phaeton</HI> is &s;aid

inflammable Sub&s;tances; or whether it were &s;ome prodigious quantity of in|flammable
Steams collected in the Air, and &s;o burnt off by continual Light|ning,
it is hard po&s;itively to determine, becau&s;e that part of the Story I
conceive to be Hypothetical, and Conjectural, or Philo&s;ophical, and not
meerly Hi&s;torical. But the Effects produced, tho&s;e I conceive to be Hi&s;tori|cal;
that is, that there were divers parts, which were before covered by
the Sea, that by this Eruption, were rai&s;ed from under it and left dry. <HI>Tum

tumblings of the Earth. <HI>Alma tamen Tellus, ut eras circumdata ponto, inter a|quas

no manner of doubt of the de&s;ign of the Story, <HI>viz.</HI> That it was de&s;igned to

by Earthquakes; &s;ince all things are &s;o properly delineated and repre&s;ented
for that end, as if the Poet or Maker thereof had been &s;pectator or Eye|witne&s;s
of it, or at lea&s;t a Contemporary with it. And we may here find the
whole Progre&s;s or Phaenomena of an Earthquake from its very fir&s;t beginning
to its very la&s;t end, and the effects al&s;o that precede it, and tho&s;e that are
&s;ub&s;equent to it, as I could plainly &s;hew if it were not too much for this pre|&s;ent
Di&s;cour&s;e, by explaining the Mythologick Hi&s;tories immediately prefixt
and following it. Nay, there has not been in this late Earthquake in <HI>Sicily</HI>
<PB N="394" REF="373">
which &s;eems to be the greate&s;t mentioned in Hi&s;tory) any one Phaenomenon
which cannot be &s;hewn in this of <HI>Phaeton,</HI> and indeed mo&s;t of the Phaenome|na
mentioned in this of <HI>Phaeton</HI> have been exhibited or exemplified in this
la&s;t of <HI>Sicily;</HI> which I could ea&s;ily manife&s;t by comparing <HI>Ovid</HI>'s De&s;cription
with that of the <HI>Italian</HI> Frier; but I &s;hall pa&s;s it by for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>I have,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Part of another Lecture to the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</NOTE> in &s;ome of my former Di&s;cour&s;es, indeavoured to &s;hew &s;ome Pro|babilities,
that the Mythologick Stories of the Poets did couch under tho&s;e
mon&s;trous and &s;eemingly impo&s;&s;ible repre&s;entations of Actions performed by
humane Powers, &s;ome real and actual Cata&s;trophies that had been cau&s;ed by
the Body or Face of the Earth by other Natural Powers, of which the <HI>Ae|gyptians,
Chaldeans, Greeks,</HI> or &s;ome other learned Nations had pre&s;erved
&s;ome Hi&s;tories or Traditions among the more learned part of them; which,
that they might the better conceale their Knowledge, and keep it to them|&s;elves,
and ab&s;cond it from the Vulgar, and &s;uch as were not initiated and
admitted into their Fraternities, they had contrived and dige&s;ted into fabu|lous
Stories, which, as they might &s;erve to amu&s;e and awe the Vulgar by the
Daemonology they had thereupon &s;uper&s;tructed, &s;o they might &s;erve to in|&s;truct
and inform the Adepti, or &s;uch as were admitted to the true interpre|tation
and under&s;tanding of what they knew, of the real Hi&s;tory that was
concealed thereby, as al&s;o of their Philo&s;ophical or Phy&s;ical Hypothe&s;is for
the Explication and Solution thereof. I think it cannot be doubted that the
Theogonia of <HI>He&s;iod</HI> was of this nature, which if it was <HI>He&s;iod</HI>'s (of which,
yet I confe&s;s their are &s;ome Moderns make a doubt) it &s;eems to have been
&s;ome of the fir&s;t Notions which the <HI>Greeks</HI> had obtained of the&s;e Matters
from the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> or <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> or &s;ome other of the Ea&s;tern Nations; except
we &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Orpheus,</HI> who preceded both <HI>He&s;iod</HI> and <HI>Homer</HI> near five 100
Years, might in tho&s;e times have known and communicated &s;ome what of
what they had by the &s;ame Methods procured. The Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e times
are very dark and uncertain, and nothing convincing can be built upon them.
It will be therefore but, lo&s;t Labour to indeavour to prove my Conjectures
from Hi&s;tories, or hints to be &s;ought among tho&s;e few Fragments which are
now to be met withal among the Relicks of written Antiquities. Tho&s;e, if &s;uch
there were, (as being committed to &s;mall and peri&s;hable Sub&s;tances) have been
more ea&s;ily drowned and &s;wallowed by time, or buried and overwhelmed with
the Du&s;t of Oblivion: And the Copy or Counterfeits of &s;ome of them, which
have been made by &s;ome of tho&s;e we now call the Ancients (though with re|&s;pect
to them they are to be accounted Modern) &s;eem to have been but very
imperfect, and to have been like Structures made up and peiced of the Rub|bi&s;h,
Ruins and Fragments of tho&s;e Antiquities which they in tho&s;e times
could rake together; &s;o that though &s;ome great Buildings have been by the&s;e
&s;ecundary Ancients erected; yet being made up of &s;uch Fragments or Parts
of tho&s;e more ancient &s;acred Piles, by the new Di&s;po&s;ition and Order of them they
now appear a prepo&s;terous <HI>Moles,</HI> yet we cannot but conceive that they had
&s;ome better and more certain informations of tho&s;e more ancient Hi&s;tories or
Traditions than what we now can find; and we cannot think &s;o mean of them
as not to believe they did in &s;ome mea&s;ure comprehend the Intention, Mean|ing,
and Drift, or De&s;ign of tho&s;e that preceded them; and tho' they want|ed
a compleat knowledge, yet from the knowledge they had of the then
Ruins, they were better inabled to Judge and Conjecture concerning them,
than we now can. And tho' their Conjectures might not be all right, yet we
cannot but think they might be tollerably near the matter, and that they did
acquaint Po&s;terity by their Writings what tho&s;e their Conjectures were. And
of this Nature I take the Metamorpho&s;is of <HI>Ovid</HI> to be, who, I conceive, had
made it his &s;tudy to inform him&s;elf as fully as he was able of what was then
to be found concerning that knowledge, and out of tho&s;e informations he
compiled that Book which was to compri&s;e all the Records of Antiquity con|cerning
the Changes and Cata&s;trophies that had happened to the Earth from
the Creation unto his own time, which his four fir&s;t prefactory Ver&s;es do plain|ly
enough declare. <HI>In Nova fert animus mut at as dicere formas, Corporae dii caeptis
nam vos muta&s;ti &amp; illas, A&s;pirate meis, Prima&abque; ab Origine mundi, In mea per|petuum
deducite tempora Carmen.</HI> Which is as much as to &s;ay, my de&s;ign in
<PB N="395" REF="374">
this Book is to &s;peak concerning the various alterations and transformations
which the Bodies or &s;uperficial Parts of the Earth have, by the Divine Powers,
undergone; for to tho&s;e he doth a&s;cribe them, <HI>Nam vos muta&s;tis &amp; illas,</HI> and
therein to comprize all the knowledge I have been able to procure from the very fir&s;t Creation or Original of it, even to the&s;e very times in which I
live. And accordingly we find him to begin this his Hi&s;tory, even with the
beginning of the Creation of the Earth it&s;elf, and therein to have followed
the Traditions, Opinions, and Doctrines of the mo&s;t Ancient Sages con|cerning
its manner of Formation out of a preceeding Chaos; which Do|ctrine
that it was very ancient, and indeed the mo&s;t ancient of all others con|cerning
the Origination of it, I think the Learned and Ingenious Dr. <HI>Bur|net</HI>
in his <HI>Archaeologia</HI> has &s;ufficiently proved, and therefore I &s;hall not need to
&s;ay any thing concerning it; only I would make this one occa&s;ional Remark.
That how ancient &s;oever it was, it did not &s;avour of an unlearned or igno|rant
Age or of a fir&s;t beginning of real Knowledge, for that we find by <HI>Ovid</HI>'s
Copy of it, that it contained a more refined Conception concerning the Fi|gure,
and Shape, and Properties of the Earth, than many of the Greek Phi|lo&s;ophers
(who in probability were many hundreds of Years after tho&s;e fir&s;t
Sages) had concerning it. Some of tho&s;e Greek Philo&s;ophers making the
Earth to be of the form of a Drum or Cylinder, others of an infinite Column,
others of a Skiff or Boat, or of a floating I&s;land in the mid&s;t of an infinite|ly
extended plain Ocean, and others of other extravagant Shapes; whereas
we find that the Doctrine of the Chaos made it to be of a Sphaerical Form,
<HI>Solidumq; coercuit orbem,</HI> to con&s;i&s;t of Land and Water, to have a proper
Gravity that kept all its parts in that &s;hape, or his <HI>Tellus (Elementa&abque; grandia
traxit &amp; pre&s;&s;a e&s;tgravitate &s;ua</HI>) to be Involved with the Air, and that again
with the Aether. <HI>Haec Super impo&s;uit liquidum &amp; gravitate carentem Aethera nec
quicquam terraenae foecis habentem,</HI> to be &s;u&s;pended in the Air, or Aether, or
&s;pace of Heaven without being &s;upported by any imaginary Foundation, as
tho&s;e Greeks fancied. <HI>Circumfu&s;o pendebat in aere tellus, Ponderibus librata &s;uis.</HI>
Nay, and by &s;everal other Pa&s;&s;ages and Expre&s;&s;ions of this Book, it is clear,
that in tho&s;e very ancient times, whenever they were, for 'tis hard certainly
to limit them; the Learned Men that then lived, had arrived to a very great
height of Natural Knowledge, e&s;pecially of that part which concerned the
Co&s;mography or Con&s;titution of the Univer&s;e; and by that Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>$g|nea
convexi vis &amp; &s;ine pondere Caeli emicuit, &s;umma&abque; Locum &s;ibi legit in Arce.</HI> It
&s;eems plain that they placed the Sun in the Center of the univer&s;e, and made
the Earth to move about it. <HI>Principio terram, ne non aequalis ab omni Parteforet,
magni Speciem glomeravit in orbis.</HI> But this only by the bye; for I know the
common interpretation of the&s;e places, is altogether differing from what I
now give, yet were it now my bu&s;ine&s;s, I think I can &s;hew &s;u&s;ficient Rea&s;ons
to per&s;uade any unprejudiced Per&s;on that what I have given is the de&s;igned
meaning of them; but I proceed to &s;hew the general de&s;ign of <HI>Ovid</HI> in this
Book. After the De&s;cription of the formation of the Earth, he comes to
de&s;cribe the fir&s;t times of its continuance; that is, the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or unknown
Ages of the World, of which he makes four, the Golden, Silver, Brazen
and Iron, in the la&s;t of which comes in the Mythologick and Hi&s;torick, for
that he him&s;elf hath Mythologized al&s;o &s;ome of the Hi&s;torical Times and
Events. What &s;pace of Time he allows to each of the&s;e Ages it doth not &s;o
readily appear, but it is certain that the <HI>Chaldeans, Aegyptians, Brachmans,</HI> and
&s;ome Heathen Hi&s;torians have a&s;&s;igned &s;paces large enough and even beyond
belief almo&s;t; and Mr. <HI>Graves</HI> tells us, that the Chine&s;e do make the World
88640000 Years old. He begins the Mythologick Times with the Gygantomachia,
which to me &s;eems to be nothing el&s;e but a De&s;cription of &s;ome prodigious
Earthquakes or Eruptions. And that by the Giants he plainly means noth|ing
el&s;e but the Subterraneous Fires or Accen&s;ions which break out, and
throwing up before them the Earth, &s;eemed to threaten the very Heavens
by piling Mountain upon Mountain (<HI>Affecta&s;&s;e ferunt Regnum Caele&s;te Gygantes Alta&abque; conge&s;tos Struxi&s;&s;e ad Sidera montes</HI>) I &s;hewed before in the interpreta|tion
of the Rape of <HI>Pro&s;erpine,</HI> where it plainly appears what was meant by
<HI>Typheus</HI> one of tho&s;e Giants, who is &s;aid to lie buried under the I&s;land of <HI>Si|cily,</HI>
<PB N="396" REF="375">
and therefore &s;hall not need to &s;ay more upon that Subject. After the
breaking forth of the&s;e Subterraneous Streams and Flames, we find <HI>Ovid</HI>
de&s;cribing them to be burnt off with Lightning. <HI>Tum Pater omnipotens mi&s;&s;o
perfregit Olympum Fulmine &amp; excu&s;&s;it Subjectam Pelion O&s;&s;a. Obruta mole Sua
cum corpora dira jacerent, perfu&s;am multo Natorum Sanguine terram immadui&s;&s;e
ferunt, Calidum&abque; anima&s;&s;e cruorem.</HI> This we find to be a general Concomitant
or Sub&s;equent of &s;uch Eruptions, and it were ea&s;y to produce many Examples
of it in our late Eruptions; and 'tis al&s;o as u&s;ual for many of tho&s;e places
that have been thrown or rai&s;ed up into Hills to be &s;unk or tumbled down a|gain,
<HI>Excu&s;&s;it &s;ubjectam Pelion O&s;&s;a.</HI> So we are told of a Hill that lately ro&s;e
up by <HI>Catanea,</HI> which &s;oon &s;unk again. [<HI>Obruta</HI>] by this, I think, is plainly
&s;ignified the Eruption of fiery Streams or Rivers of melted Minerals out
of tho&s;e Orifices or fiery Vents, &s;uch as in the two la&s;t Earthquakes in <HI>Sicily</HI>
have broke out of <HI>Aetna,</HI> and overflowed and burnt up and de&s;troyed &s;everal
Towns, Villages, Fields, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for what can better expre&s;s the moving, ra|ging
and devouring Qualities of &s;uch a &s;tream of Liquid Fire, than to call it
an animated, or living &s;calding Gore from its red and fiery Colour, its
&s;calding and burning Heat, its fluidity and rapid Motion, and its devouring
and con&s;uming Power; but it would be too tedious to in&s;i&s;t on all the remarkable
Circum&s;tances and Expre&s;&s;ions, which, I conceive, makes it plainly enough
appear what was the De&s;ign and Scope of the Story; nor need I mention
the De&s;cription of it by other Mythologers, as <HI>Claudian, Hygynus, Antoninus,
Liberalis.</HI> Nor will it, I hope, be needful to an&s;wer any thing to tho&s;e who
would interpret it another way: Some making it to be only a De&s;cription of a
Rebellion; others a di&s;gui&s;ing of the Hi&s;tory of the Tower <HI>Babylon.</HI> I &s;hall rather
leave it to the Judgment of every one to make choice of which interpreta|tion
he &s;hall, upon duly con&s;idering the relation, think to be mo&s;t aggree|able
to the whole drift of the Book. And what I now deliver I would not
have to be taken otherwi&s;e than only as my Rea&s;onings and Conjectures up|on
the like Con&s;iderations: For as I ob&s;erved before, the Poet has &s;o couched
all his Relations and Expre&s;&s;ions as to comprize a Phy&s;ical, a Moral, and an
Hi&s;torical Meaning in them. And it may be &s;o interpreted as if it were de|&s;igned
to de&s;cribe &s;ome particular Earthquakes, or &s;ome particular Rebellion,
or the general Rebellion of wicked Men again&s;t Heaven, and the Divine
Powers, or the attempt ot tho&s;e at <HI>Babel,</HI> and at the &s;ame time it may al&s;o
be found de&s;ignedly to contain in brief the Theory or Opinions of the mo&s;t
antient Phy&s;iologers which they held concerning the Cau&s;es and Effects of
Earthquakes upon the uper Face of the Earth; which to me, I confe&s;s, &s;eems
to be the principal aim and de&s;ign or this Story of <HI>Ovid,</HI> as well as of the
mo&s;t part of the re&s;t of the Book, which I de&s;ign, God willing, to prove
more expre&s;ly and particularly in a Treati&s;e upon this Subject, &s;o &s;oon as I
have &s;ettled &s;ome Affairs, which have hitherto hindred me from perfecting
that and many other Subjects.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not need here to &s;ay any thing concerning the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Greeks</HI>
in tho&s;e former Ages of turning all their Hi&s;tories into Mythologick Poetry;
'tis plainly enough proved by that Relation I read the la&s;t day out of <HI>Plato's
Timaeus;</HI> and it was not only u&s;ed by them but by divers others Nations, as
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Germans,</HI> as you will know. I &s;uppo&s;e the rea&s;on was for the
better fixing it into the Minds of the Youth by a kind of indelible Character,
as <HI>Plato</HI> expre&s;&s;es it: Which could not be forgotten; for extravagant Marks
we know are the great helps of Artificial Memory, for that they rai&s;e extra|ordinary
Attention; and that extraordinary Attention and Wonder does &s;tig|mati&s;e
or burn in as twere indelible Ideas in the Memory. Plea&s;ure al&s;o is
another help to fix Ideas, and that Poetry and Songs contribute to, and the
activity of the Spirits in Youth work the Effects more powerfully, and
make them more durable. The&s;e I imagine were the Rea&s;ons why the <HI>Aegyptians,
Greeks</HI> and other Nations converted their true Hi&s;tories into the&s;e Roman|tick
Fables: Not that I do here undertake for the truth of Hi&s;tory in every
Fable, for I conceive that there are as various kinds of Fables as there are of
Hi&s;tories. Some are repeated and believed Fables which are true Hi&s;tories,
others are believed true, but are really Fables: Some are believed Fables
<PB N="397" REF="376">
and are really &s;o, and others are believed true and really are &s;o. But of this
fourth Head I fear is the &s;malle&s;t number; but we mu&s;t take the be&s;t Evi|dence
we can to confirm our Belief of tho&s;e that are generally &s;o reputed: A|mong
which none has been more looked after of late than Medalls, In&s;crip|tions,
and real Monuments, yet remaining of the preceding Per&s;ons and
Actions, the&s;e are by all looked upon as a mo&s;t undeniable Proof to confirm a
written Hi&s;tory, and yet we know that many things of this kind have been
counterfeited, yet that cannot be &s;aid of all: Now, if the&s;e that may be
counterfeited be yet looked upon as more Authentick than Written Hi&s;tory,
then certainly the&s;e Medals, In&s;criptions, or Monuments of Natures own
&s;tamping, (which I alledged to prove an Hypothe&s;is) which 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for
Art to counterfeit, might in rea&s;on be looked upon as Proof &s;ufficient tho'
no Hi&s;tory could be produced. If I &s;aw a perfect Medal, tho' I could not be
a&s;&s;ertained whether it were Antique or Counterfeit, yet I could certainly
conclude it had been made by Art from the &s;en&s;ible Characteri&s;ticks of it;
now it &s;eems very &s;trange to me that &s;o many evident Characteri&s;ticks as may
be plainly di&s;covered in tho&s;e figured Bodies &s;hould not force an a&s;&s;ent; but
truth will in time prevail; but to give as much &s;atisfaction as I can to all
Doubts, I will pitch upon one or two of the Fables of the Metamorpho&s;is
for in&s;tances, to &s;hew that they were de&s;igned to convey a certain Hi&s;tory ve|ry
much differing from the fir&s;t appearance of the Fable. I will begin with
tho&s;e of <HI>Per&s;eus, Atlas, Andromeda</HI> and <HI>Medu&s;a,</HI> becau&s;e, as I conceive, they
have relation to the <HI>Herculean Columns,</HI> and to the <HI>Atlantis,</HI> or tho&s;e parts
of <HI>Libya</HI> which were near it; they are &s;omewhat long, however I mu&s;t beg
your Patience to explain them a little more fully, and I will be &s;horter in the
re&s;t.</P>

they have all &s;uch Hi&s;tories couched under them, I do no ways doubt; not on|ly
for the Arguments I at fir&s;t mentioned, but for &s;everal others. Moreover
I do conceive, that there is a Chronologoe of the preceding times to be di&s;|covered
out of them, and that they are written, not fortuitou&s;ly, but with
great Care, and according to the due Order in which they happened. And
tho' po&s;&s;ibly this do not at fir&s;t view &s;o plainly appear, nor can be &s;o unde|niably

<P>Read <HI>March</HI> 8, 169^2^^3.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fable of the Rape of <HI>Pro&s;erpina.</HI></NOTE> I have &s;ome Years &s;ince propounded in this place my
Conjectures for the explication of the Mythology delivered by <HI>Ovid</HI> in his
<HI>Metamorpho&s;is,</HI> namely, That he thereby de&s;igned to compri&s;e a Hi&s;tory of
the changes which had happened to the World from the beginning thereof
to the times wherein he lived, which he &s;ignfies Aenigmatically by the fir&s;t
four Ver&s;es. The method of which is by per&s;onating Things and Powers:
The one by Mortals, namely, material Things, the other by Immortals,
namely, Powers, or Energies and compri&s;ing therein a three fold <HI>Cabala</HI> or
Tradition, namely, A <HI>Phy&s;ical,</HI> comprehending the Cau&s;es, Effects and Rea|&s;ons;
an <HI>Hi&s;torical,</HI> comprehending the Times, Ages, Per&s;ons and Places,
And a <HI>Moral,</HI> to make them In&s;tructive and U&s;eful for the Regiment, and$
morali&s;ing the more vulgar part of Mankind. In which he has indeavour|ed
to follow the method of the Greek Poets, who, as I have formerly exem|plified
in <HI>Homer, He&s;iod,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Mythologers, did pro&s;ecute
the &s;ame de&s;ign. By the interpretation of which Mythology, if we could
di&s;cover and find out the true Key, I conceive it would open and make ma|nife&s;t
much of the Hi&s;tory of the Cata&s;trophics that have happened in the
World, and of the places and Ages wherein they were produced.</P>
<P>That which makes me repeat this Notion at this time, is the dreadful Ef|fects
of the late Earthquake in <HI>Sicily,</HI> which put me in mind of what I had
here formerly in&s;tanced, on the Story as it is delivered by <HI>Ovid</HI> in his fifth
Book concerning the Rape of <HI>Pro&s;erpina</HI> by <HI>Pluto,</HI> which I then conceived, and
am &s;till of the &s;ame Opinion (however others were of a contrary) was de&s;igned
by the Poet to repre&s;ent &s;ome dreadful Earthquake that had formerly
happened in <HI>Sicily</HI> not far, nor much differing from the Place and Effects of
this late dreadful Cata&s;trophy: Save only that we do not yet hear of the
&s;wallowing up, or the &s;inking down into or under the Water of any con&s;i|derable
Country or Town, which I conceive is plainly &s;pecified by the Poet
to have been effected by that which he de&s;igns to delineate: For <HI>Pro&s;erpina</HI> or
<HI>Abrepta,</HI> as the Name &s;ignifies is plainly de&s;cribed to have been &s;eated in
that place of the I&s;land where the Lake <HI>Pergu&s;a</HI> was in <HI>Ovid</HI>'s Time, and
where it remains, I &s;uppo&s;e, to this Day: It is de&s;eribed to be the Daughter
or Off-&s;pring of <HI>Ceres,</HI> that is, a City or Place flouri&s;hing in a much civili&s;ed
and well cultivated Country; for that <HI>Ceres</HI> doth plainly denote, and is &s;o
&s;ignified by the Poet.</P>
<Q><LG>

<L>And fir&s;t taught Men to feed on Fruits and Corn:</L>

</LG></Q>
<P>This Place or Country was al&s;o very plea&s;ant and flouri&s;hing with Fruits, Flow|ers
Fountains, e&s;pecially Woods, in which <HI>Pro&s;erpina</HI> is &s;aid to be di&s;porting and
innocently gathering Flowers, when <HI>Pluto</HI> &s;uddainly &s;ei&s;ed her and carried her
into the Earth; that is, whatever the place were, whether Town, Village or City
before the Rape, it &s;eems to have the &s;ame fate with St. <HI>Euphaemia</HI> mentioned
by <HI>Kircher</HI> in his <HI>Mundus Subterraneus;</HI> that is, to have been by an Earth|quake
&s;wallowed up into the Earth, and to have &s;unk &s;o low, as to have left
a Ba&s;on for a Lake for after Ages, to this Day. Now, that this is plainly
the Phy&s;ical meaning of the Poet will appear plain if the whole Story be taken
in. Fir&s;t, The Poet tells you the place to be <HI>Trinacria</HI> or <HI>Sicily.</HI> This Country,
the' mo&s;t Delicious, Plea&s;ant, rich in Soil, well Cultivated and Tilled, and
<PB N="403" REF="382">
very much Civili&s;ed and Governed by good Laws, as is figured by <HI>Ceres,</HI> as
I have mentioned, was yet feated on a Sulphureous, and Fiery, Cavernous
Foundation, &s;ubject to Heavings, Tremblings and Earthquakes, expre&s;&s;ed
by the Giant <HI>Typhaeus,</HI> who had endeavour'd to invade Heaven, that is, to
belch up Flames, and throw Stones and Rocks against it, but at length came
to be covered with this I&s;land. Ver&s;e 346, to 356. Hereupon <HI>Dis</HI> or <HI>Pluto,</HI>
that is, the Spirit of the Earth is fained by the Poet to be rou&s;ed up to &s;ee
lea&s;t the Vault of the Earth over his place or Re&s;idence, &s;hould be broken by
the fury of the Giant <HI>Typhaeus;</HI> that is, by the working of the Sulphureous
Vapours and Fulminations, Ver. 356&mdash;<HI>Et Rex pavet ip&s;e &s;ilentum,</HI> Ver. 362.
That is, the Earth ro&s;e and &s;welled, and there were Eruptions of Smoke
&s;ignified by the Black Hor&s;es his Chariot was drawn by, and there was a ge|neral
Earthquake over all the I&s;land, but the great Eruption was at the place
where the Lake <HI>Pargu&s;a</HI> is. Here the Poet fains that <HI>Pluto,</HI> or the Subter|raneous
Powers were in Love with the Beauty of this Goodly Place per&s;onated
by <HI>Pro&s;erpina. Venus,</HI> or Youthful Beauty or Thoughts doth excite <HI>Cupid</HI> or
Love and De&s;ire in this Terre&s;trial or Subterraneal Power to take away this
plea&s;ant Place, <HI>Pro&s;erpina</HI> from its curious Situation, and &s;wallow it up, or
hurry it away on a &s;udden into his own, or the Subterraneous Regions. Ver.
363, to 385. All Poetical to expre&s;s how <HI>Dis</HI> was thus enamored of <HI>Pro&s;erpina,</HI>
from 385, to 395. The plea&s;ant Situation of <HI>Pro&s;erpina</HI> is de&s;cribed&punc; from
395, to 408. The Cata&s;tophy is de&s;cribed, which manife&s;ts, that this terrible
Earthquake extended from the place where the Lake <HI>Pergu&s;a</HI> now is to the
Place where the City of <HI>Syracu&s;e</HI> &s;tood, now called <HI>Sarago&s;a,</HI> where the River
<HI>Anapis</HI> runs into the Sea: By this the Lake <HI>Anapis</HI> was broken, open and made a
Bay to the Sea, and no remainder of <HI>Cyane,</HI> but &s;ome &s;mall Brooks that run
into that Bay. This I take to be the meaning of the Poet from 409, to the
end of 437. The remaining part of the Story &s;eems to be a de&s;cription of
the Deva&s;tations made in the Country, being made unfit for Tillage, and
therefore <HI>Ceres</HI> is &s;aid to &s;eek her Daughter <HI>Pro&s;erpina</HI> all over the World, the
remaining Husbandman &s;eeking for other places fit for Tillage, but returns to

<P>It would be too long to interpret all which I think I could ea&s;ily do, and &s;hew
plainly the meaning of the Physical <HI>Cabala.</HI> But I de&s;igned to mention this
only at pre&s;ent as an example pertinent to this pre&s;ent time, when we yet
have the noi&s;e of the <HI>Sicilian</HI> Earthquake, and &s;ome others, yet &s;ounding in

<PB N="404" REF="383">
al&s;o to be able to produce very good Arguments for it, and that it was not
an Hypothe&s;is propo&s;ed at random, as &s;ome may imagine.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e the&s;e in them&s;elves, tho' fully proved, were not &s;ufficient to
&s;olve all the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature as to the Di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e figured Bo|dies,
whether Shells or other Sub&s;tances; therefore in the fourth place I laid
down as a Suppo&s;ition, that the &s;uperficial Parts of the Earth had been very
much altered by <HI>Subterraneous Eruptions,</HI> whereby divers Parts that had before
&s;uch Eruptions or Earthquakes been under the Sea, had been rai&s;ed out of it
and been made I&s;lands; and that other parts that had been dry Land had been
&s;unk into and covered by the Sea; that Vallies had been turned to Cliffs, and
Hills to Vallies or Lakes, and the like.</P>
<P>This was likewi&s;e oppo&s;ed and thought very improbable, becau&s;e for &s;o
long time as our Hi&s;tory will reach backwards, it was affirmed there had hap|pened
no &s;uch change; and therefore, becau&s;e it was &s;uppo&s;ed no &s;uch Hi|&s;tory
could be produced, this al&s;o was to be rejected, and we mu&s;t again have
recour&s;e to the <HI>Lu&s;us Naturae</HI> as the only expedient to give &s;atisfaction; only
&s;ome kind of Subterraneous Pa&s;&s;ages were thought of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Confirmation of the <HI>Atlantis.</HI></NOTE> by which Oy&s;ters and
other Fi&s;h might be conveyed to the middle of the <HI>Alps,</HI> going alongwith the
Stream of the Water from the Sea to &s;upply the Springs and Fountains at
the top of the Hills.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s it seemed to me a little hard, becau&s;e I could not give the Pedi|gree
of the Fi&s;h, therefore I &s;hould not be allowed to believe it a Fi&s;h, when
I &s;aw all the &s;en&s;ible marks of a Fi&s;h; and that, becau&s;e I could not tell who
it was, or upon what occa&s;ion that cau&s;ed the Stones on <HI>Salisbury</HI> Plain to be
di&s;per&s;ed in that irregular Regularity, that therefore I mu&s;t allow them to
be a <HI>Lu&s;us Naturae,</HI> or placed there by <HI>Merlin</HI> or, &s;ome &s;uch unknown way,
and not by the Hands, Labour or Workman&s;hip &s;ome &s;uch Men as are now
living. Neverthele&s;s that I might, as far as I was able, &s;atisfy the&s;e Objections
al&s;o, I produced the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Plato</HI> as brought out of <HI>Aegypt</HI> by <HI>Solon,</HI> con|cerning
the I&s;land of the <HI>Atlantis.</HI> But this tho' related by <HI>Plato,</HI> with all the
Circum&s;tances, as if he believed it a true Hi&s;tory, was yet &s;uppo&s;ed to be on|ly
a Fiction of <HI>Plato</HI> to lay the Scene of his Common-wealth, or at be&s;t a Fable
of the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Prie&s;t to magnify the knowledge of the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> as to the
Hi&s;tory of preceding Ages. I confe&s;s the account of the nine thou&s;and Years
is Argument enough to make the whole Hi&s;tory to be &s;u&s;pected as a Fiction;
but yet till we are certain what &s;pace of Time is there &s;ignified by a Year it
will be a little hard to reject the whole for that Circum&s;tance, &s;ince mo&s;t of
the other Circum&s;tances of it are more probable.</P>
<P>And that they were thought &s;o by divers of the Ancients, is plain from &s;e|veral
Te&s;timonies that might be alledged; I &s;hall only mention what <HI>Strabo</HI>
&s;ays of it in his &s;econd Book, where examining whether <HI>Erato&s;thenes</HI> had duly
amended the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> of the Antients headds, that <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
&amp;c. <HI>Erato &s;thenes</HI> (&s;ays he) has done well in expounding the manner how the
Surface of the Earth may be changed, by relating how the &s;ame may &s;ometimes
be rai&s;ed, and &s;ometimes be &s;unk by Earthquakes, and various otherways
changed, as we al&s;o have in many particulars Enumerated, by which al&s;o he hath
properly &s;hown how the Hi&s;tory, which <HI>Plato</HI> relates concerning the I&s;land of
<HI>Atlantis,</HI> as it was brought out of <HI>Aegypt</HI> from the Prie&s;ts there, by <HI>Solon,</HI> may
be well believed not to be a Fiction, but a true Hi&s;tory. From which Pa&s;|&s;age
it is plain, that both <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Erato&s;thenes</HI> did look upon this Hi&s;tory
of <HI>Plato,</HI> or rather of the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> as very probable; <HI>Pliny</HI> al&s;o was of the
like Opinion, as appears, not only by his mentioning the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Plato,</HI> but
by the &s;everal other Mutations, which he relates to have been made by the
means of Earthquakes.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e the Scene of this Tragedy of <HI>Atlantis</HI> was placed very far back|wards
in times remote, and that we have no other Hi&s;tory of this change but
what <HI>Plato</HI> is plea&s;ed to relate, I did therefore indeavour to produce &s;ome
Hi&s;tory concerning the changes that had happened &s;ince that time, namely,
within the reach of the Greek Hi&s;tories, in the &s;ameplace where this <HI>Atlantis</HI>
<PB N="405" REF="384">
was &s;aid to be &s;unk down into the Sea. For this I produced the Hi&s;tory of
the <HI>Periplus</HI> of <HI>Hanno,</HI> the <HI>Carthaginian,</HI> as it is &s;et forth by <HI>Berkelius;</HI> from
which I collected that at the time when this Expedition was made, the place
where the <HI>Atlantis</HI> was &s;aid to be &s;unk, was found to be partly Sea and part|ly
I&s;lands, and that the &s;ame extended, as I conceive, as far to the We&s;t|wards
almo&s;t as the <HI>Madera</HI> I&s;land, about which place was then found a &s;mall
I&s;land called <HI>Cerne;</HI> from which Coa&s;ting Southwards for twelve Days, they
found the Land all on Fire, and one prodigious high Mountain flaming out at
the top, called <HI>Theon Ochema,</HI> or the Chariot of the Gods; which, by all Cir|cum&s;tances,
I conceived to be the &s;ame with the now Pike of <HI>Teneriff.</HI> Sup|posing
which Relation true, I deduced thence that there mu&s;t needs have hap|pened
great changes in tho&s;e Parts between the time of this Expedition and
the pre&s;ent; for that all tho&s;e places which &s;eem to be de&s;cribed by that Hi|&s;tory
are not now to be found in the places where they are by that Relation
placed. But this Relation was al&s;o looked upon as fabulous, becau&s;e I pro|duced
no other Authority for it be&s;ides the Relation it&s;elf and the Te&s;timony
of <HI>Pliny.</HI> But tho&s;e who are better read in Ancient Hi&s;tory, may find that it
was by mo&s;t of the Ancients &s;uppo&s;ed real; and all agree that the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI>
of whom the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> were a Colony, were very skillful in A&s;tronomy, Na|vigation,
Arithmetick and Traffick, and that they were the fir&s;t introducers
of the&s;e among the Greeks, together with the Knowledge and U&s;e of Let|ters.
And from tho&s;e Particulars I noted in the &s;aid Relation, it &s;eems to
me very evident, that they under&s;tood what Longitude and Latitude was,
and knew how to keep account of their Cour&s;e and Di&s;tance; and tho' the
Interpretation thereof which I produced, be differing from all the other I
have yet known: Some &s;uppo&s;ing it to relate wholly to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI> as
it is &s;haped, at pre&s;ent, and others in other Situations, yet whoever
(taking this Notion of their skill in A&s;tronomy and Navigation along with
them) &s;hall &s;trictly examine the Relation it&s;elf, he will, I conceive, be per|&s;uaded
to be &s;omewhat of my Mind. <HI>Strabo</HI> therefore &s;ays of them. <HI>The</HI>
Sidonians <HI>were reported to be good Arti&s;ts in various things, as it is al&s;o manife&s;t by
their Actions; as al&s;o,</HI> and <HI>Philo&s;ophers, A&s;tronemers and Arithmeticians, and
&s;uch as well knew the &s;e$ret of Numbers and of S$$iling in the Night al&s;o.</HI> From
which con&s;idenration I conceive, that <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> in the Relation can &s;ignify no|thing
el&s;e but the &s;ame Paralled of Latitude, or the &s;ame &s;traight Line with
that from <HI>Carthage</HI> to the Mouth of the <HI>Streights.</HI></P>
<P>I was not then able to quote the place in <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> which relates to this di&s;|covery
of the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> tho' I was well a&s;&s;ured I had met with &s;uch a Re|lation;
'Tis in his Book, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, in the&s;e Words,
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, &amp;c.&startq; In the Sea that lies without the Pillars of
<HI>Hercules,</HI> they &s;ay, that, by the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> there has been di&s;covered an
I&s;land de&s;erted, but abounding with variety of Woods, and rich Rivers fit
for Navigation, abounding al&s;o with variety of Fruits, di&s;tant from the
Continent &s;everal Days Sail.&endq; <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> al&s;o mentions the extream <HI>At|lantick</HI>
to be inhabited by a wild &s;ort of People, which he calls <HI>Aegypanes,
Blemmeae</HI> and <HI>Gamphalentes,</HI> and a kind of <HI>Satyrs.</HI> And in his Third Book and tenth Chapter, he &s;ays, <HI>Vltra hunc &s;inum m$ns altus ut Graec$ vocant <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
vehiculum Deorum perpetuis ignibus flagrat,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> al&s;o mentions
&s;ome &s;uch I&s;land in his Fifth Book <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, &amp;c.
That is, &startq;Again&s;t <HI>Libya</HI> there is &s;ituated an Island in the Ocean, con&s;iderable
for Magnitude, &s;everal Days Sail di&s;tant towards the We&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&endq; I could
cite &s;everal other Authors who mention &s;ome &s;uch Place, which may have
relation to the di&s;coveries of the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> in <HI>Hanno</HI>'s Expedition; all
which do plainly make it appear, that his di&s;coveries were towards the We&s;t,
and not towards the South; and therefore it &s;eems very probable, that at
that time there were I&s;lands both greater and &s;maller to the We&s;twards of the
Streights Mouth, which are not now to be found, and con&s;equently they mu&s;t
have &s;uffered a Submer&s;ion by &s;ome intervening Cata&s;trophies, which was the
thing Iindeavoured to deduce from it. Nor will it &s;eem &s;o unlikely if we will
<PB N="406" REF="385">
but con&s;ider the alterations by Eruptions out of the Sea near the I&s;lands of
the <HI>Canarys,</HI> and in one of the I&s;lands al&s;o within the&s;e few Years; the for|mer
was the Eruption out of the Sea, in the Year 1639, which <HI>Athanatius
Kircher</HI> has given a de&s;cription of, and I have received a relation of it by
Word of Mouth from two Per&s;ons who were both upon the <HI>Tenariff</HI> I&s;land at
the &s;ame time, and had each of them often ob&s;erved it tho' at a con&s;iderable
di&s;tance: The latter Eruption happened within a few Years &s;ince in one of the
&s;ame I&s;lands, of which I have Printed the Relation in one of my Collections.</P>
<P>And thus, I hope, I have given &s;ome ground to believe that the Antient
Hi&s;torians knew and gave &s;ome Credit al&s;o to both the&s;e Relations, namely,
that of <HI>Solon</HI> and that of <HI>Hanno,</HI> which, by that Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> appears
to have been made either before or in his time.</P>
<P>I came in the next place to &s;hew that the <HI>Metamorpho&s;is</HI> of <HI>Ovid</HI> contained
many Hi&s;tories of great Changes and Cata&s;trophies that had happened long
before his time to the parts of the Earth; which, tho' rapped up in Mytho|logy
and Ma&s;carade, yet tho&s;e di&s;gui&s;es being removed, it will not, I con|ceive,
be very difficult to make appear what the true Hi&s;tories are, which
now pa&s;s Incognito. To this purpo&s;e I did ob&s;erve that <HI>Ovid</HI> has in &s;ome part
or other of his Fable, given Marks or Characteri&s;ticks by which it may be
found what the Hi&s;tory is which he doth there Mythologize; this he doth
very often in that part which &s;erves as a Link to join the Story into a con|tinued
Chain&punc; or in the Etymology of the Names, tho' often times al&s;o in the
proce&s;s of the Poem. And 'tis u&s;ual with him all along to have and mix a
treble De&s;ign in each of them, namely, an Hi&s;torical, a Phy&s;ical, and a Mo|ral;
and this he hath done with great Judgment and Subtilty of Invention
and upon &s;everal occa&s;ions, he makes Excur&s;ions into this or that De&s;ign
and pro&s;ecuting it for a time, as if he had no re&s;pect to the other two; but
yet, if well examined, it will be found, I conceive, in mo&s;t that he influenc|eth,
even there al&s;o, that de&s;ign by the other two. If I had lei&s;ure to pro|&s;ecute
this Speculation, I conceive I could trace mo&s;t of the&s;e his De&s;igns but
it would be too long a Work; however, I hope in a &s;hort time to be able to
give &s;everal In&s;tances and Examples out of tho&s;e I have more attentively ex|amined,
which may &s;uffice to &s;hew that there is a probability in this Con|jecture
how differing &s;oever it be from other Commentators.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e perhaps may not be thought &s;ufficient for the pre&s;ent Di&s;pute to
&s;atisfy &s;uch as demand po&s;itive and direct Hi&s;tories, and undoubted Records
of &s;uch changes, as I have &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ary to make out the Hypothe&s;is of
the figured Bodies, which are found to be real Shells, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to have been by
them di&s;po&s;ed and &s;ituated in the places where they are now found: For &s;uch
therefore I &s;hall prepare a Cloud of Witnesses, which, unle&s;s they will deny
all Hi&s;troy, will &s;tand the Proof.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I cannot &s;ee any Circum&s;tance in the story of <HI>Hanno</HI> that &s;hould
render it &s;u&s;pected, &s;ince 'tis granted by all, that the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> of whom the
<HI>Carthaginians</HI> were a Colony, were &s;o early eminent in Arts, e&s;pecially in that
of Navigation and Traffick; &s;o that we find <HI>Solon</HI> made u&s;e of them; a$$
that <HI>Sanchoniathon Beritius</HI> before the time of the <HI>Trojan</HI> War, did write the
Theology of the <HI>Phaenicians</HI> (as <HI>Porphyrius</HI> relates) in the <HI>Phaenician</HI> Language:
And that the Philo&s;ophy of the Greeks was derived principally from them;
as al&s;o A&s;tronomy, and even the knowledge and u&s;e of Letters. For <HI>Thales</HI>
was a <HI>Phaenician,</HI> and <HI>Pherecides</HI> who was the Ma&s;ter of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> and the
founder of the Italick Phylo&s;ophy, and co-equal with <HI>Th$$$$</HI> learned it out
of the occult Books of the <HI>Phaenicians.</HI> And from <HI>Pythagoras</HI> his Philo&s;ophy
sprang and flowed both the <HI>Platonick</HI> Philo&s;ophy, and al&s;o the Philo&s;ophy of
his Scholar <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> tho' &s;omewhat altered by the Pipes it ran through. So
that tho' we have but very little of the Hi&s;troy of tho&s;e Times, yet by tho&s;e
few Fragments di&s;per&s;ed here and there, we may be &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied they
were able, and actually did make as great Voyages and Di&s;coveries, as that
of <HI>Hanno;</HI> of which there are divers Relations mentioned by <HI>Herodotus</HI> in
his second Book.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="386">
But tho' (notwith&s;tanding what I have alledged) all the&s;e Hi&s;tories &s;hall be
looked upon as Fictions and Romantick without any real Ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tho' Hi&s;tory &s;hould fail Ex|periments are Cogent.</NOTE> yet what
I have indeavoured to &s;hew by Experiment and In&s;pection, and the deducti|ons
made therefrom, will not be found de&s;titute of good Authority, proved
from very eminent Authors both Antient and Modern, to make out the Truth
and Certainty thereof. As fir&s;t to prove, that tho&s;e Bodies were found at
the tops of Mountains, and that they were notwith&s;tanding a&s;&s;erted to be
Shells; we have the Te&s;timony of <HI>Herodotus</HI> in his <HI>Euterpe</HI> or &s;econd Book,
and twelveth Section,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proofs out of <HI>Herodotus.</HI></NOTE> where &s;peaking of the Country of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> as having
been mo&s;tly rai&s;ed by the Mud and Sand of the <HI>Nile,</HI> he &s;ays, the whole
Country was of &s;uch a Soil, only the Mountain above <HI>Memphis</HI> was Sandy,
and had <HI>Conchilia</HI> or Fi&s;hes Shells upon it, and abounded with Salt, &s;o that it
corrupted the <HI>Pyramids.</HI> Which Pa&s;&s;age is very pertinent to my pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e,
and is al&s;o fully confirmed by <HI>Ari&s;totle;</HI> For it &s;eems all the lower <HI>Ae|gypt</HI>
was a Plain, which had ro&s;e by the &s;ettlement of Mud of the <HI>Nile,</HI> which
he &s;ays, in the &s;pace of nine hundred Years, had been rai&s;ed eight Cubits, or
twelve Foot; for that eight Foot ri&s;e of the <HI>Nile,</HI> in the time of <HI>Myris,</HI> o|verflowed
all <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and in his time there was nece&s;&s;ary &s;ixteen Cubits, or
twenty four Foot &s;welling to overflow it. So that he &s;eems to under&s;tand,
that all the lower <HI>Aegypt</HI> had been at fir&s;t Sea, and that the <HI>Nile,</HI> by degrees,
had filled it up to the height of the Plain, and &s;o had covered all the bottom
or Sand of the Sea, only the Mountainous part above <HI>Memphis</HI> was above that
l&eacute;vel, and &s;o that kept its old bottom or covering of Sand and Shells. This
&s;eems to be the meaning of what he argues for; but yet I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that
does not &s;olve all the Difficulty; for how comes this Mountain to be &s;o much
higher than the Plain, as it was then rai&s;ed by the <HI>Nile,</HI> and thence that
Plain to be much above the Sea that was thereby excluded, unle&s;s we do &s;up|po&s;e
al&s;o that &s;ome Subterraneous Power did rai&s;e that Mountain above the
level it was of when covered by the Sea, or that the Sea had &s;ometimes been
&s;o high as to cover that Mountain, which, tho' <HI>Herodotus</HI> takes no notice of,
yet <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> does fully &s;olve it; but be it which way &s;oever,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Pyramids</HI> are founded on a Rock</NOTE> 'tis Te&s;timony
enough of the matter of Fact that <HI>Herodotus</HI> him&s;elf calleth them <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
and ob&s;erved the exudation of the Salt. But this Place is al&s;o ob&s;ervable
for another Pa&s;&s;age, and that is to confirm Conjectures I formerly acquainted
the Society with, concerning the <HI>Pyramids of Aegypt,</HI> namely, that I con|ceived
them to be <HI>founded on and A&s;hler'd as it weere about a Core of Rock,</HI> and
by this Di&s;cour&s;e it is plain, that the place where they &s;tand is &s;o qualified;
for by this De&s;cription 'tis plain, that it is de&s;cribed as Rocky, and covered
with Sea Sand; for that <HI>Herodotus</HI> takes notice it had both Sea-&s;hells, and Salt
mixed with it; but this here only by the bye. Before I leave <HI>Herodotus</HI> his
Te&s;timony, I cannot but take notice of another Pa&s;&s;age in the &s;ame Book, in
the 74th and 75th Paragraphs; the tran&s;late runs thus, <HI>Circa Thebas &s;unt Sa|cri
Serpentes Nihil omnino hominibus noxii, pu&s;illo corpore, binis praediti cornibus e
&s;ummo vertice enatis, quos defunctos in Jovis Aede &s;epeliunt, huic enim Deo Sacros
illos e&s;&s;e praedicant;</HI> thus far is the &s;tory he is told by the <HI>Aegyptians, E&s;t au|tem

<P>Part of this &s;tory is what he was told, part what he &s;aw; he was, told of
flying Serpents, which the Bird <HI>Ibis</HI> met over that Valley, and &s;o devoured
them leaving only the Back-bone. I have heard many &s;tories told of our
Snake-&s;tones or <HI>Cornua Ammonis,</HI> and I have &s;een &s;ome to confirm the &s;tory
with a very formal Head carved on them; I think not long-&s;ince here was one
&s;hewed in this place; I am apt to think the Spines of the Serpents <HI>Herodotus</HI>
there found in &s;uch plenty and &s;uch variety of bigne&s;&s;es, were no other than
tho&s;e <HI>Cornua Ammonis,</HI> and thence, I conceive, proceeded the &s;uper&s;titious
<PB N="408" REF="387" MS="Y">
Cu&s;tom when they found any of these Stones or Spinae they carried and buried
them in the Temple of <HI>Jupiter Ammon,</HI> and it &s;eems to me a farther con|firmation
of what I formerly hinted concerning the Stone adorned with Jewels,
and carried in proce&s;&s;ions by the Prie&s;ts of that Temple, mentioned by <HI>Pliny</HI>
and &s;everal others. But to proceed, to this Te&s;timony and Opinion of <HI>Hero|dotus,</HI>
I &s;hall add that of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> as related by <HI>Ovid</HI> in his 15th Book of
the Metamorpho&s;is, <HI>ver.</HI> 262, and &s;o onwards. <HI>Vidiego quod fuerat quondam

Te&s;timonies 'tis plain that this Phaenomenon of Shells was taken notice of by
the Antient Hi&s;torians and Philo&s;ophers: And I am apt to think that this
might, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;pread among them, the Notion of general Deluges
that in preceding Ages had happened, as <HI>Pythagoras</HI> &s;eems to hint in this
place, by &s;uppo&s;ing them to happen after a certain long Revolution of time;
and that <HI>Thales,</HI> and many others, &s;uppo&s;ed that the Principle, from which
all things &s;prung, was Water: And that the Pa&s;&s;age in the Fragment of <HI>San|choniathon,</HI>
where he &s;peaks of the fir&s;t Original of all things, &s;ays, That in
the <HI>Phaenician</HI> Language it was called <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, which po&s;&s;ibly may be much of the
&s;ignification of <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> in the Hebrew, which &s;ignifies Motion; that is, Fluidi|ty,
for &s;o the interpretation of <HI>Sanchomathon</HI> &s;eems to make it <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.

watery mixtures (as if <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> were derived from <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>Mors</HI> Death or Cor|ruption)
from which &s;prung the Seeds of all living Creatures, and the Gene|ration
of all things. That the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> threw the Hi&s;tory of the Flood &s;o
far backwards, and made it &s;o differing from the Chronology of the Bible, I
take it to be for no other Cau&s;e but to make the World believe they were pre|ceding
to all others in Antiquity of Hi&s;tory and Chronology: To which
purpo&s;e <HI>Herodotus</HI> tells a plea&s;ant Relation of <HI>P&s;ammiticus,</HI> that the Aegyp|tians
before his time had vaunted them&s;elves to be fir&s;t People upon the
Face of the Earth, but he having a mind to be informed of this by Experi|ment,
cau&s;ed two Children to be bred up in a De&s;ert Place by a Shepherd,
&s;o that they &s;hould not hear any Language to all &s;poken, to the end to &s;ee
what Language they would naturally &s;peak of them&s;elves; from hence he
&s;uppo&s;ed they would &s;peak the fir&s;t and mo&s;t Natural Language. This ha|ving
been done, and the Children grown two Years old, the Shepherd o|pening
the Door of the place where they were &s;o kept and fed with Milk,
they both reached out their hands to him crying <HI>Beccos,</HI> which the Shep|herd
taking notice of acquainted <HI>P&s;ammiticus</HI> with, who inquiring what that
word might &s;ignify in any Language, was informed that <HI>Beccos</HI> &s;ignified Bread
in the <HI>Phrygian</HI> Language; from which time <HI>Herodotus</HI> &s;ays, the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> lo&s;t
their &s;eniority, and granted the <HI>Phrygians</HI> to be the fir&s;t and them&s;elves the
&s;econd People for Antiquity. So that tho' their account of Years may be hence
&s;uppo&s;ed to be uncertain, yet their Learning and their la&s;ting Monuments of
their former greatne&s;s, namely, the <HI>Pyramids, Obelisks, Colo&s;&s;i, Labyrinths,</HI> and
the like, &s;hewed them to have been long before <HI>Herodotus</HI> his time very con|&s;iderable
for Arts and Literature. And that they had &s;ome Records of a
preceding Flood, I have before mentioned, whether the &s;ame with that of
<HI>Noah,</HI> Or &s;ome more particular Flood, which tho&s;e of <HI>Deucalion</HI> and <HI>Ogygas</HI>
&s;eem to have been, I leave to the learned Antiquaries to determine. I could
produce &s;everal other Te&s;timonies to &s;hew they had the notion of a Deluge.</P>
<P>But it &s;eems to me very improbable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood.</NOTE> that the&s;e Shells &s;hould have been the
effect of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood by rea&s;on of its &s;hort duration; which was not long
enough of continuance to produce and perfect tho&s;e Creatures in &s;o &s;hort
a &s;pace to the bigne&s;s and perfection they &s;eem to have had. It mu&s;t there|fore
have been either &s;ome particular Floods of a longer duration; or el&s;e
the places where they are found, mu&s;t have been &s;ome times or other the bot|tom
of the Sea, and afterwards rai&s;ed by Subterraneous Motions, Swellings,
or Eruptions: Which, whither tho&s;e ju&s;t immediately preceded the end of
the general Deluge in the time of <HI>Noah,</HI> and that That part which before
the Flood was Land, did &s;ink, and became covered by the Sea, and tho&s;e
<PB N="409" REF="388">
parts which were before under the Sea, did, by degrees, towards the deter|mination
of that Cata&s;trophy, ri&s;e and &s;well up into Land, Hills and Moun|tains,
I leave to the Learned to determine. Certain it is, that there were
&s;ome very great changes of the &s;uperficial Parts of the Earth at that time;
&s;ince it is &s;aid; that all the Fountains of the Deep, or Aby&s;&s;e, were broken
up; the Scripture renders <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
There &s;eems by the Expre&s;&s;ion to be a twofold &s;upply
of Water to cau&s;e this Flood, the one by the opening of the <HI>Stereoma</HI> or Fir|mament
in the middle of the Waters, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
and of the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, the gathering together of the Waters
above the former <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; but <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, the&s;e God called the
Sea, and the parts of the Earth that were uncovered thereby he called dry
Land. The <HI>Stereoma</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> is a&s;&s;igned for the place of the Stars, Sun and
Moon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and has always the Epithet of <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> joined with it.
<HI>Ovid</HI> likewi&s;e who &s;eems to allude in &s;ome mea&s;ure to this Hi&s;tory of the Crea|tion
delivered by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the fir&s;t Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Circumfluus hu|mor
ultima po&s;&s;edit &s;olidum&abque; coercuit orbem.</HI> I think, were it proper to the
pre&s;ent Subject, I could give a very plau&s;ible account concerning the manner
of that Deluge, as it is expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> tho' it differ from all that I have
yet met with, yet I can prove it warranted both by the Text and by genuine
Phy&s;ical Principles: but it would be too long a digre&s;&s;ion for the pre&s;ent Sub|ject,
and I &s;hall &s;hortly have a more proper opportunity to demon&s;trate the
inner Parts and Con&s;titution of this Globe, my pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s being to
explicate the Phaenomena of the outward and &s;uperficial Parts, and to prove
that the Bodies, which I have a&s;&s;erted to be Shells, have been &s;o reputed by
the Antient as well as the Modern Hi&s;torians: Next to &s;hew that they are,
or have been, found in mo&s;t Parts of the World. And if tho&s;e two be prov|ed,
then will nece&s;sarily follow that there mu&s;t have been &s;ome time or o|ther
&s;uch Cata&s;trophies, Metamorpho&s;es, or Mutations as mu&s;t haue cau&s;ed
tho&s;e parts, which were once the bottom of the Sea, to be now, or at the
time when they were &s;o ob&s;erved, to be dry Land.</P>
<P>That they were &s;o e&s;teemed by divers of the Antients I have in part &s;hewn
and could inlarge upon that Head, but that I would likewi&s;e &s;hew that they
have been &s;o e&s;teemed by the mo&s;t eminent of our Modern Naturali&s;ts, and
for this I could produce the Te&s;timonies of <HI>Georgius, Agricola, Cardan, Ge&s;ner,
Aldrovandus, Ferranti Imperatus, Wormius, Calceolarius, Bauhinus, Belonius,
Fraca&s;torius, Ci&s;alpinus, Fabius Columba, Stevinus,</HI> and a great many others yet
more Modern, be&s;ides the Te&s;timony and Opinion of divers others, who
have them&s;elves declared their judgment by word of Mouth; but this would
be too great a wa&s;ting of Time to prove that which carries in it&s;elf the true
<HI>Medium</HI> of its Proof and Demon&s;tration, which is by &s;en&s;ible examination.
I &s;hall therefore only give one In&s;tance or two for all, and that is, Fir&s;t, That
of <HI>Fabius Columba,</HI> who has writ a Treati&s;e on purpo&s;e to evidence this Truth
by many Arguments; 'tis at the end of his Treati&s;e <HI>De Purpura. Nituntur

<PB N="410" REF="389">
which would be too long to trouble you with at this time, and I only proceed|ed
&s;o far that I might give an occa&s;ion to have the Experiment now tried in
the pre&s;ence of this Society, there being &s;everal of that kind in the Repo&s;i|tory,
and the trial being very ea&s;y will not be long in making, all things be|ing
in a readine&s;s for it. I &s;hall only add one more Te&s;timony, which is of
<HI>Andreas Ci&s;alpinus</HI> in his fir&s;t Book <HI>de Re Metallica</HI> and &s;econd Chapter. <HI>In
fodinis metallorum &s;eu Marmorum</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>aliorum&abque; Saxorum Nunquam vivens
Corpus Reperitur. Et&s;i enim aliquando in eorum Cae&s;ura o&s;trearum te&s;tae aut caetera

Arit&s;toteles. Hoc enim modo Cen&s;ere mag is Con&s;onum e&s;t rationi, quam putare vi$
animalem, intra Lapides, rudimenta animalium ac plantarum Gignere ut quidam pu|tant.</HI>
He hath not told where <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> hath maintained this Doctrine; but
who&s;oever &s;hall examine his Writings, &s;hall, by many Pa&s;&s;ages in them find,
that he was fully of this Judgment: And more fully in the fourteenth Chap|ter
of the fir&s;t Book of <HI>Meteors,</HI> where al&s;o he confirms the &s;ame Sentiments
of <HI>Herodotus,</HI> which I have newly quoted; and concurs likewi&s;e with the Do|ctrine
of the alterations that are cau&s;ed by &s;low degrees of Progre&s;s, which I
have Hypothetically explained by the Oval Figure of the Earth, and the al|teration
of that &s;horter Axis to differing parts of the Earth: But this only
by the bye to &s;hew how much &s;oever than Hypothe&s;is were exploded by a
learned Dr., by rea&s;on of the Con&s;equences that would follow from it; yet
<HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> (though he hath not explained by what means and in what manner)
hath a&s;&s;erted Mutations as great and much after the &s;ame method of Pro|gre&s;&s;ion,
as tho&s;e which are alledged to be the <HI>extravagant Con&s;equences of that
Hypothe&s;is,</HI> &s;ome of which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention at another time.
So that to conclude for this time I hope I have &s;hewn good grounds to evince.
Fir&s;t, That the&s;e kind of Bodies are either Animal or Vegetable Sub&s;tances
Secondly, That the places where the&s;e are found mu&s;t have &s;ometimes been
covered with the Sea. Thirdly, That the general Deluge of <HI>Noah</HI> was not of
duration enough to effect it, unle&s;s the manner of it effecting were after that
which I proposed, by changing that part which was before dry Land into Sea,
by &s;inking; and that which was Sea into dry Land, by ri$ing underneath it
Fourthly, That the univer&s;ality of the $word$ over the whole Earth &s;eem
to argue for this manner. Fifthly, That there have been &s;everal particular
Floods, as that of <HI>Deucal$$,</HI> the $span$ which being cau&s;ed, for the
mo&s;t part, by Earthquakes, may have been the $word$ of divers particular
<HI>Phaenomena,</HI> &s;uch as the raising of some part, from under the Sea, and the &s;in$|ing
of others into it, or into $word$.</P>
<P>The former Lecture was read <HI>Feb.</HI> 15th. 1688.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 29. 1688. I have, in my former Lecture, proved how early and how
generally the Phaenomena of Shells were taken notice of by the most antient
Hi&s;torians and Philo&s;ophers, and I could have given many other In&s;tances to
confirm it, if it had been thought nece&s;&s;ary. $span$ I conceived, might
be continually revived the Traditions and Theories concerning preceding
Floods and other Cata&s;trophies that had happened to the Earth in Ages long
preceding. But becau&s;e, among the Philo&s;ophers, I only quoted that place
in <HI>Plat$</HI> about the <HI>Atlanti$,</HI> which was thought to be a $iction (however that
&s;hewed he had &s;uch a notion) and the Doctrine or $word$ as reported by
<HI>Ovid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">E$oufs out of Ari&s;totle.</NOTE> which was thought Poetical (tho' a$ I conceive $word$ tho&s;e Mythologies
have certain Hi&s;torical and real Truths thereby repre&s;ented) I &s;hall there|fore
add one out of <HI>Arti&s;totle</HI> which I hinted the la&s;t Day out of his fir&s;t Book
of Meteors. &startq;The &s;ame parts of the Earth (&s;ays he) are not always dry or
moi&s;t, but they receive a change from the increa&s;e or defect of River,
therefore parts bounding Sea and Land change often, nor is the &s;ame part
always Sea or always Land, but it is changed in time, and that which was, Sea
is Land, and that which was Land is Sea; but this is in a long proce&s;s&punc;
This arrives from interior changes of the Earth, which from a long Con&s;ti|tution
grows old, as the Bodies of Plant and Animals, and that not &s;ingly the
<PB N="411" REF="390">
Parts but the whole. It may therefore for a time be moi&s;t, and by degrees
grow dry and old: This may happen both by the decrea&s;ing of Rivers and al&s;o
of the Sea; but the&s;e happen not, but in a long time, in compari&s;on of our
&s;hort Life, which is the cau&s;e they are not noted, the change being &s;o little
in the &s;pace of one Life, and &s;o &s;everal Ages pa&s;s before they are fini&s;hed;
whence the memory of them is loft. (He adds much more to the &s;ame effect
to explain his Notion) Exemplifying his Doctrine by <HI>Aegypt,</HI> which (&s;ays
he) has been all made by Mud of Rivers, and is ob&s;erved continually to
grow drier, and the Lakes filling up by degrees have been inhabited, and
length of time has obliterated the memory of &s;uch changes; for all the pre|&s;ent
Mouths of <HI>Nile,</HI> except the <HI>Canobic,</HI> have been cut by Art; for old
<HI>Aegypt</HI> was that only about <HI>Thebes,</HI> as <HI>Homer</HI> te&s;tifies, who lived not long
after the&s;e Changes; for he mentions <HI>Thebes</HI> only as if <HI>Memphis</HI> had not yet
then been, &s;o he proceeds in explicating, and in&s;tances again in &s;aying, &s;o
mar&s;hy places grow better by draining, but dry grow wor&s;e and barren, as
it has happened to the Country about the <HI>Argives,</HI> and the <HI>Mycenaeans,</HI> and
what has happened to the&s;e parts, the &s;ame may be conceived of the whole.
So many parts which have been Sea have been added to the Continent; and
the contrary, tho&s;e that do <HI>re&s;picere and pauca,</HI> a&s;cribe the&s;e changes to the
Heavens, but they are mi&s;taken, but they are to be a&s;cribed to Cau&s;es that
happen after a long proce&s;s of time, as that of <HI>Deucalion</HI>'s Flood, which hap|pened
only to <HI>Greece</HI> about that part which is called old <HI>Hellas,</HI> which is
that about the pre&s;ent <HI>Dodon</HI> and <HI>Achelou$</HI> this happened from great abun|dance
of Rains which are generated by the Mountains, which are by de|grees
changed and &s;o produce differing effects. He exemplifies his Doctrine
further by <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and the Country where the Oracles of <HI>Jupiter Ammon</HI>
was, &s;aying, Twas formerly Mar&s;hy, but by degrees dried and grew parched;
&s;o not only the pre&s;ent mo&s;t famous Rivers will come in long proce&s;s of time
to be dried and changed, but the Sea al&s;o; and that which was Sea will be
Land, and the Land will be Sea.&endq; I have here given the &s;um of his Doctrine
which he doth much inlarge upon to explain it; but to &s;ave time, I have only
ab&s;tracted the meaning, and given you the Epitomy of it that may ea&s;ily e|nough
be more fully explained or read at large in the fourthteenth Chapter of
his fir&s;t Book of <HI>Meteors.</HI> By the whole it plainly appears, that <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> was
of the Opinion that all the dry Land or the Earth had been &s;ometimes cover|ed
with the Sea, which he &s;eems to be informed of by the then pre&s;ent <HI>Phae|nomena,</HI>
as he plainly expre&s;&s;es in his de&s;cription of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and of the Coun|try
about the Oracle or <HI>Jupiter Ammon;</HI> and 'tis not to be doubted but one
of tho&s;e <HI>Phaenomena</HI> and po&s;&s;ibly not the lea&s;t con&s;iderable was that of the Sea|&s;and
and Shells, which I &s;hewed the la&s;t Day <HI>Herodotus</HI> had taken notice of. I
do therefore humbly conceive (tho' &s;ome po&s;&s;ibly may think there is too much
notice taken of &s;uch a trivial thing as a rotten Shell, yet) that Men do gene|rally
too much &s;light and pa&s;s over without regard the&s;e Records of Antiqui|ty
which Nature have left as Monuments and Hieroglyphick Characters of
preceding Transactions in the like duration or Tran&s;actions of the Body of the
Earth, which are in&s;inirely more evident and certain tokens than any thing of
Antiquity that can be fetched out of Coins or Medals, or any other way yet
known, &s;ince the be&s;t of tho&s;e ways may be counterfeited or made by Art and
De&s;ign, as may al&s;o Books, Manu&s;cripts and In&s;criptions, as all the Learned
are now &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied, has often been actually practi&s;ed; but tho&s;e
Characters are not to be counterfeited by all the Craft in the World, nor can
they be doubted to be, what they appear, by any one that will impartially ex|amine
the true appearances of them: And tho' it mu&s;t be granted, that it is
very difficult to read them, and to rai&s;e <HI>Chronology</HI> out of them, and to &s;tate
the intervalls of the Times wherein &s;uch, or &s;uch Cata&s;trophies and Mutati|ons
have happened; yet 'tis not impo&s;&s;ible, but that, by the help of tho&s;e
joined to other means and a&s;&s;i&s;tances of Information, much may be done even
in that part of Information al&s;o. And tho' po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome may &s;ay, I have
turned the World up&s;ide down for the &s;ake of a Shell, yet, as I think, there
is no one has rea&s;on for any &s;uch a&s;&s;ertion from any action I have hitherto
done; yet if by means of &s;o &s;light and trivial Signs and Tokens as the&s;e are,
<PB N="412" REF="391">
there can be Di&s;coveries made and certain-Conclu&s;ions drawn of infinitely
more important Subjects; I hope the attempts of that kind do no ways de|&s;erve
reproach, &s;ince po&s;&s;ibly 'tis not every one that takes notice of them,
nor one of a hundred that does, that will think of a rea&s;on; be&s;ides, much
greater conclu&s;ions have been deduced from le&s;s evident and more incon&s;ider|able
Marks, if we re&s;pect Bulk, Magnitude, or Number, and much more
weighty Con&s;equences may, and will in time, be drawn from &s;eemingly more
trivial, and much lighter and &s;lighter Indications, yet where the Te&s;timonies
are clear, certain and &s;elf-evident, they are not to be rejected for their bulk,
tho' it be, &s;o &s;mall as no Eye or Sen&s;e can reach it unle&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Engines,
as the Sight by a Micro&s;cope, Tele&s;cope, and the like: In how few Letters,
Words, or Characters is the Hi&s;tory of the World before <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood? Is
it therefore not to be believed becau&s;e we have not as many Volumes of its
Hi&s;tory as there are now to be found words? In how little room will the Hi|&s;tory
of the flood be contained if <HI>Homer</HI>'s Iliads could be boxed in a Nut|&s;hell?
But to leave every one to the freedom of his own Thoughts, I &s;hall pro|ceed
to what I thought was further nece&s;&s;ary to be added to what I hinted the
la&s;t Day, which was concerning the Flood of <HI>Noah,</HI> becau&s;e I find the gene|rality
of tho&s;e who indeavour to give a &s;olution of the&s;e <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> are in|clinea
to a&s;cribe them to the effects of that Flood, and becau&s;e what I then
&s;aid Was but in brief, and &s;o po&s;&s;ibly what I de&s;ign might not be &s;o plainly ap|prehended,
or it may be mi&s;con&s;trued, I thought it might be nece&s;&s;ary to ex|plain
it a little more fully. I &s;aid then, that I conceived that tho&s;e univer&s;al
<HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the remainders of the Sea which are found in all parts almo&s;t of
the pre&s;ent &s;uperficial Parts of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A farther ex|plication of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood. and the forma|tion of the world.</NOTE> could not be cau&s;ed by the general
Flood of <HI>Noah,</HI> if the manner of performance and executing thereof were
&s;uch as is for the generality &s;uppo&s;ed and explained by Commentators by rea&s;|on
that they make the time of the continuance of the pre&s;ent &s;uperficial&punc;
Parts of the Earth under the Waters to be no longer than the time of the
duration of the Flood, as it is recorded in Holy Writ. Suppo&s;ing that the
pre&s;ent Earth and Sea is in the &s;ame places with re&s;pect to the Body of the
Earth as they were before the Flood; nor will the Hypothe&s;is or Explication
of the ingenious Author that has lately writ of that Subject, reach it, he
&s;uppo&s;ing there was no apparent Sea before the Flood, but that the Sea was
all covered by the Earth, if at lea&s;t I do rightly comprehend his intentions;
for that &s;pace of time will not be found of duration long enough to produce
<HI>de novo</HI> &s;uch multitudes of tho&s;e Creatures, and to &s;uch Magnitudes and Ages
of growth as many of them &s;eem to have had, and it will be difficult to be
imagined, that &s;uch Creatures as do not &s;wim in the Water, &s;hould, by the
Effects of that Deluge, be taken from their Re&s;idences in the bottom of the
Sea and carried to the top of the Mountains, or to places &s;o far remote from
tho&s;e Re&s;idences. So then, if we will a&s;cribe tho&s;e Phaenomena to that Flood,
it will be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider which way that Cata&s;trophy might be effected
that it might be the occa&s;ion of &s;uch effect, I therefore &s;aid, that un|le&s;s
we &s;uppo&s;ed that there were thereby a change wrought of the &s;uperficial Parts
of the Globe, and that tho&s;e parts which before the Flood were dry Land be|came
Sea, and the parts which were before covered by the Sea after the &s;aid
Deluge, became the dry Land, it &s;eems to me, tha&s;e appearances cannot
be &s;olved by <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood.</P>
<P>Tho' po&s;&s;ibly this may &s;eem a little improbable upon the fir&s;t mentioning
of it, yet po&s;&s;ibly al&s;o upon a little further examination, it may be thought

<P>We have no other means of being informed of the true Hi&s;tory of it, but
what is to be found recorded in the &s;acred Writing of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> and therefore
those are to be con&s;ulted, and the true meaning of them, as far as can be,
mu&s;t be obtained; for whatever el&s;e may be &s;$at$ered here and there in other

I conceive then, that con&s;idering the De&s;criptions of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> both of the Ge|neration
of the Earth and manner of the Flood, the Hi&s;tory of both may be
thus explained.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, For the Fabrick of the Earth, the De&s;cription is but &s;hort in the
fir&s;t Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> and 2d Ver&s;e. <HI>Et terra erat Solitudo &amp; Inanitas &amp; Ca|ligo
Super facies aby&s;&s;i, &amp; Spiritus Dei manabat Super facies aquarum, &amp; dixit Deus
&s;it lux &amp; fuit lux.</HI> This doth &s;eem to repre&s;ent the order of the four Grada|tions,
Earth in the middle, Water next, then Spiritus, then Light; the
Central Earth is de&s;cribed only as a <HI>Vacuum,</HI> and called the <HI>Aby&s;&s;e,</HI> and
Darkne&s;s inclo&s;ing it; that is, the Water follows next above it, which co|vered
it all round: Above this the Air, and la&s;tly the Fire, Aether, or Light
in the fourth Ver&s;e, according to the Hebrew, <HI>Et divi&s;it Deus inter Lucem &amp;
inter tenebras:</HI> The Septuagint renders it, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
That is, God cau&s;ed a twofold Seperation, one in the
middle of the Light or Aether, and another in the middle of the Darkne&s;s,
which covered the Face of the Aby&s;&s;e or Central Earth; which covering of
Darkne&s;s was the Water, which is often called the Aby&s;&s;e or great Deep;
the former of the&s;e is afterwards always called the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
the Firmament of Heaven, to di&s;tingui&s; it from the latter, called the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
the Firmament in the middle of the Waters; for in the &s;ixth
Ver&s;e it is &s;o expre&s;t, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Let
there be a Firmament in the middle of the Waters, and let it be a divi&s;ion be|tween
the Waters and the Waters: And in the &s;eventh Ver&s;e; and God made
the Firmament, and God made a &s;eparation of the Waters that were below
the Firmament, from the Waters that were above the Firmament. And in
the eighth Ver&s;e, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">; it is generally rendered,
and God called the Firmament Heaven; I conceive it may be rendered, Al&s;o
God called the Heaven the Firmament, for to &s;hew that there was al&s;o a Fir|mament
of the Heavens; for &s;o it is afterward every where called, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
But this I &s;ubmit to Divines.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t Firmament then, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, &s;eems to have been a &s;olid
and hard Sphaerical Shell, as it were, which incompa&s;&s;ed the Ball of the Earth
Central, not clear without the Liquid Water, as the hard Shell of the Egg
is without the White, and &s;o the Egg-&s;hell doth inclo&s;e the whole White of
the Egg, as well as the White inclo&s;eth the Yolk: But it was, as I conceive,
meant, that this Firmament or Sphaerical hard Shell was placed, as it were,
in the middle of all the White, or of the incompa&s;&s;ing Water; the Circum|ferential
half of it being without the Shell, and the Central half of it with|in
in the Shell. So then at its fir&s;t Creation, the order was fir&s;t the Central
Earth or great Aby&s;&s;e; this was in the middle as the Yolk of the Egg round or
Sphaerical; this was inclo&s;ed in Darkne&s;s by the Shell of Water underneath
the Firmament, being half the whole Body of the Water which was inclo&s;ed
perfectly within this Firmament, as the White of the Egg by the Egg-&s;hell;
and by that hard Shell it was perfectly &s;eperated from the other half of the
Water which was above the Firmament, and as it were a &s;econd, White of
the Egg without the Shell, and was the Water upon the Face of which the
Spirit was &s;aid to move; &s;o that the whole Globe, for that time, was all co|vered
with Water. This <HI>Ovid</HI> &s;eems to allude to, when he faith, <HI>Circumfluns
humor ultimo Po&s;&s;edit, Solidumg; coercuit orbem;</HI> which I took notice of in my
Lecture about the Hi&s;tory of the World, as expre&s;&s;ed by that ingenious My|thologick
Poet; for he &s;eems to make the Water to be both below the Shell
of the Earth and to encompa&s;s it.</P>
<P><HI>Plato al&s;o</HI> was of that Opinion in making <HI>Tartarus</HI> the place of the Waters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">of Tartarus</NOTE>
that is the middle and Central parts of the Ball or Globe of the Earth; and
&s;o the hard part of the Earth to be nothing but this Shell near the Superfi|cies,
and it &s;eems al&s;o, that <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> yea, and the <HI>AEgyptians</HI> and <HI>Chaldeans</HI>
likewi&s;e were of the &s;ame Sentiment, and divers are of Opinion that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>
al&s;o under&s;tood the &s;ame by the great Aby&s;&s;e which he mentions in the De|&s;cription
of <HI>Noah's</HI> Flood. Butt by this De&s;cription of the Creation he &s;eems to
be under&s;tood otherwi&s;e, when he &s;ays, <HI>Et terra er at Sclitudo &amp; Inanitas &amp; Caligo
&s;uper &s;acies Aby&s;&s;i.</HI> For by this he &s;eems to make the form of the Terraqueous
<PB N="414" REF="393">
Globe to be no other than of a Bubble, &s;uch as Children blow into
the Air, that is only a Sphaericla film or Orb of Water, which within it had
nothing but <HI>Solitudo &amp; Inanitas, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Vacuum &amp; Fnane,</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
and only that this Film of Water was divided in the middle by the
&s;olid hard shell of the Firmament which inclo&s;ed half the Film; that is, the
inner &s;ide; and excluded the other half of the Film; that is, the outward
&s;uperficial Parts: And hence 'tis po&s;&s;ible that <HI>Virgil</HI> in the eighth Book of his
<HI>Aeneids, &s;ays, Spiritus Intus alit, totam&abque; infu&s;a per Artus men agitat molem &amp;
mago &s;e Corpore mi&s;cet. Inde hominum pecudum&abque; genus vitae&abque; volantum &amp; quae
marmoreo fert mon&s;tra &s;ub aequore pontus, &amp;c.</HI> He &s;eeming there to make the
place for the Soul of the World; others there are who would have it to be
Fire, and thence to proceed the Causes of the Vulcanos and fiery Eruption;
but <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> there places the pure Element of the Earth; &s;ome of the Mo|dern
Philo&s;ophers would hav it to be all one great Load-&s;tone. I could pro|duce
various other Opinions, but they are all but Opinions; and it matters
not much what the &s;ub&s;tance be that f$lls, it, as to the pre&s;ent inquiery; I &s;hall
therefore proceed.</P>
<P>This Firmament then in the middle of the Waters, I take to be that which
in many places of the Bible is &s;aid to be the Foundation of the Earth, as in
<HI>P&s;al. 24. 2. The Earth is the Lords and the fullneds, thereo&s; for he hath founded it
upon the Seas.</HI> (Prov. 3. 19.) <HI>The Lord by wi&s;dom hath founded the Earth, by un|der&s;tanding
hath he e&s;tablis$hed the Heavens,</HI> (this &s;eems to refer to the two Fir|maments)
and in the following Ver&s;e, <HI>By his knowledge the depths are broken at
and the Clouds drop down their Lew.</HI> (This &s;eems to refer to the Cau&s;es of the
general Deluge by opening to tho&s;e two Firmaments, as I &s;hall by and by &s;hew.)
<HI>So Job 38. 6. Whereupon are the Foundations of the Earth fa&s;tned?</HI></P>
<P>This Sphaerical Firmament or Shell then in the middle of the Waters, we
may &s;uppo&s;e, was in &s;ome places rai&s;ed or forced outwards, and &s;ome other
parts were pre&s;&s;ed downwards or inwards, and &s;unk lower, when in the
ninth Ver&s;e, God commanded the Waters under the Heaven to be gathered
together to one place, and the dry Land to appear; for by depre&s;&s;ing in or
&s;ome parts of that Sphaerical Shell (to make room to receive all the Waters
that had before covered the whole) other parts mu&s;t be thru&s;t out, the Con|tents
within being the &s;ame, and &s;o requiring equal Space or Exten&s;ion; &s;o
that what went below the former Sphaerical Surface, mu&s;t be equalled by o|ther
parts a&s;cending without that Surface, and &s;o the quantities of the Wa|ters
both within it, and tho&s;e without it, remained each the &s;ame, and &s;til
di&s;tinct and &s;eparated by this Firmament in the middle of the Waters, tho'
altered from its Sphaerical Figure; and the outward Surface of the outward
Water, as well as the inward Surface of the inward Water, mu&s;t remain
Sphaerical, becau&s;e of the Power of Gravity from without a Central Earth,
or Yolk within, formed of a Sphaerical Figure.</P>
<P>In this State the Earth &s;eems to remain till the time of the Flood, which is
accounted between &s;ixteen and &s;eventeen Hundred Years according to the
Hebrew. When <HI>God looked upon the Earth, and behold it was corrupt, for $word$
fle&s;h had corrupted their may upon the Earth, as</HI> Chap. VI. V. 12. And in the
thirteenth told <HI>Noah,</HI> that he would de&s;troy all living Creatures with the Flood&punc;
This De&s;truction began in &s;ix Hundred Years of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Life, Chap. VI.
V. II. The manner of which was expre&s;&s;ed thus in the Septugint <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
<HI>The foun|tains
of the great deep mere drawn up, and the windows of Heaven were opened.</HI> This
refers again to the twofold Firmament, that <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and that <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
As for that of the Heavens the effects of the opening of them was, that it Rained
40 Days and 40 Nights; but the Con&s;equents of the other are not expre&s;&s;ed
any otherwi&s;e, but that the Flood was upon the Earth forty Days, that is, the
Sea continued to flow in upon it. <HI>And the Waters interea&s;ed, and bare up the
Ark, and it was lifted up above the Earth, V. 17. And the Waters prevailed ex|ceedingly
upon the Earth, and all the high Halls, that were undea the whole Heavens,
were covered, V. 19. Fifteen Cubits upwards did the Waters prevail, and the
Mountains were covered, V. 20. Every living &s;ub&s;tance was de&s;troyed which was Upon
the Face of the around,</HI> Noah <HI>only, and tho&s;e with him on the Ark, remarked a|live,
<PB N="415" REF="394">
v.</HI> 23 By which it appears, that not only all Men, Bea&s;ts, Cattle, Fowls, In|&s;ects,
Worms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> peri&s;hed by the Flood, but every living Sub&s;tance; that
is, all Vegetables al&s;o; for all Animals were enumerated before: We &s;ee there|fore
that here was a double Cau&s;e of the Waters. Fir&s;t, The Rain from a|bove.
And, Secondly, The pulling up of the Fountains of the great Deep:
What I under&s;tand by the great Deep, I &s;hewed before; that is, the &s;inkings in|ward
of the Firmament in the middle of the Waters; and the forcing up of the
Fountains of the great Deep, I conceive to &s;ignify the rai&s;ing again of tho&s;e parts
that were before &s;unk to receive the Sea; and a Con&s;equent of that would ne|ce&s;&s;arily
be a &s;inking of that which was the dry Land, and a Con&s;equent of that,
flowing and increa&s;ing of the Sea from out of that which was the great Deep,
and a prevailing and increa&s;ing upon that which was a &s;inking Earth; and this
motion being forty Days in progre&s;&s;ion before the ri&s;ing Surface of the Sea,
and the &s;inking Surface of the highe&s;t Land met. So long the Waters Were
&s;aid to be flowing and increa&s;ing before it was wholly covered; nay, the Hi|&s;tory
goes on with the Journal of its progre&s;s, till the Waters were gotten fif|teen
Cubits above the highe&s;t Mountains; but then the account cea&s;eth, and
adds only, that the Waters prevailed on the Earth a hundred and fifty Days,
and &s;o long the whole Firmament was covered with Water. So that in pro|bability
the progre&s;s of the alteration of the Firmament proceeded &s;o far till it
recovered its perfect Sphaerical Figure truly in the middle of the Waters, as
it was at its fir&s;t Creation placed at about &s;eventy five Days after the forty;
but as I conceive it &s;taid not there, but the progre&s;&s;ion of both the parts went
onwards; that is, the &s;inking parts went as much below the Level, as before
they were above, and the ri&s;ing parts by degrees a&s;cended as much above as
they had been below, and that which had been the bottom of the Sea under
the Water, became the dry Land, and that which had been before the dry
Land, now became the bottom of the Sea, whether the Waters retreated
from off the&s;e parts which were rai&s;ed when the Flood was fini&s;hed; for it is
&s;aid in the eighth Chap. That God remembred <HI>Noah,</HI> and what was with him
in the Ark, to prepare them another Habitation, by making dry Land for
them again; and, Fir&s;t, The Heavens were cleared from Ra$ning. And,
Secondly, By turning of the Water that had fallen, into Vapours, and by turning
all tho&s;e Vapours, which &s;uch a Commotion or the Earth and Sea had cau&s;ed,
into Wind, and by cau&s;ing the Waters to return from tho&s;e parts which it
had covered into the Deeps that were appointed for their Reception; &s;o
that at the end of the hundred and fifty Days the new Earth began to appear.
<HI>Ver. 3. And the Waters returned from off the Earth continually, and after the end
of the hundred and fifty Days the Waters mere abated.</HI> And, <HI>v. 4. And the Ark
re&s;ted in the &s;eventh Month, on the &s;eventeenth day of the Month, upon the Moun|tains
of</HI> Ararat, which probably was the Name of the Mountain after the
Flood in the time of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> Ver. 5. <HI>And the Waters decrea&s;ed continually until
the tenth month, when the tops of the Mountains were &s;een. Forty days after this
<HI>Noah</HI> opened the Windows of his Ark and &s;ent out a Raven.</HI> So that it &s;eems that
as the old was forty Days in being covered, &s;o the new was forty Days is be|ing
di&s;covered; but <HI>Noah</HI> &s;taid yet many Days longer before the Surface of
the Ground was dried. This Explication, I think, doth fully, an&s;wer to the
words of the Hi&s;tory of the Flood as they are written, by <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> and will
likewi&s;e &s;hew a probable Cau&s;e how tho&s;e Phaenomena of Sea-&s;and and Shells
are become &s;o univer&s;al over the Face of the whole Earth, as it is at pre|&s;ent,
which were the two things which I now indeavoured to make intelligi|ble.
I have not, I hope, given any Explication, or made any Suppo&s;ition,
how differing &s;oever it be, from all the Explications I have yet met with, that
will any ways di&s;tort the plain words of the Text; for I have in this, as near
as may be, guided my progre&s;s by that Direction, and I hope I have hereby
&s;hewed a very plain and intelligible way how the Flood became &s;o perfectly
univer&s;al, and the Earth returned perfectly to its primitive and fir&s;t Created
Figure, without any extravagant &s;uppo&s;ition of new Created Waters, or
bringing them down from above the highe&s;t Heavens; nor is here any great
need of Calculation to know how great a quantity of Water would need to
be new Created and afterwards Annihilated, or fir&s;t fetcht down from the
<PB N="416" REF="395">
Heavens, and then &s;ent back again; nor is there any need of &s;uppo&s;ing the
Earth to be broken to pieces &s;ince the Flood, and the Antediluvian World
without any vi&s;ible Sea. And if it were much to the purpo&s;e, I could &s;hew
how all this, that I have &s;uppo&s;ed, may be Phy&s;ically explained, and the Ae|quilibrium
maintained: And, in &s;hort, to &s;hew how con&s;onant this Hypothe|&s;is
may be both to &s;everal Expre&s;&s;ions in the mo&s;t antient Authors, and, in a
word, with the Rules of Nature it&s;elf, of which I have formerly given divers
hints to this Society, and may &s;ome other time more fully explain, but I fear
I have detained you too long at this time.</P>

<P>THE greate&s;t Objection that has hitherto been made again&s;t a Theory
which I have &s;everal times di&s;cour&s;ed of, to give a rational and pro|bable
account of the Rea&s;ons of the varieties ob&s;ervable in the pre&s;ent &s;uperfi|cial
Parts of the Globe of the Earth; which was, that all tho&s;e inequalities of
its Surface had been cau&s;ed by the Power of Earthquakes, or Eruptions of
fiery Conflagrations in kindled in the Subterraneous Regions, which by that
means did &s;ometimes rai&s;e Mountains, Hills, I&s;lands, &amp;c. and &s;ometimes
produce the quite contrary Effects, by levelling of Eminences or &s;inking of
Places, &s;wallowing up Rivers, and making Lakes of Land, or &s;inking Lands
under the Sea, and the like.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Objection, I &s;ay, again&s;t this, I find hath been, that there
were wanting In&s;tances to confirm it from Hi&s;tory. For that, all Places,
Countries, Seas, Rivers, I&s;lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have all continued the &s;ame for &s;o long
time as we can reach backwards with any Hi&s;tory: All <HI>Greece</HI> and the <HI>Greecian
I&s;lands, Italy, Aegypt,</HI> &amp;c. are all the &s;ame as they were above two Thou&s;and
years &s;ince, and therefore they were &s;o from the Creation&punc; and will be &s;o to
the general Conflagration; and as to the effects of Earthquakes, Fir&s;t, They
have happened but &s;eldom: And, Secondly, They have not produced any no|table
Change, &s;uch as I have &s;uppo&s;ed them to be the Authors and Efficients
of; &s;o that it &s;eems but a bare Conjecture and without Ground or Foundation
&s;ufficient to found and rai&s;e &s;uch a Super&s;tructure of Conclu&s;ions as I have
thereupon rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>For An&s;wer to which I &s;hall not now repeat what I have formerly produc|ed
here, and alledged to that purpo&s;e, &s;uch as were the In&s;tances that were to
be met with here and there di&s;per&s;ed in antient Writings; &s;ince many of tho&s;e&punc;
Occurencies having been long &s;ince produced, and the relations of them made
by &s;uch as were not Eye-witne&s;&s;es, many of the particular matters of Fact
have been doubted or di&s;puted; I &s;hall therefore take notice of &s;ome particu|lar&punc;
In&s;tances which have happened within our own Memory, and more par|ticularly
of this late in&s;tance which hath happened in the <HI>Antilles,</HI> of which
we have an account but this la&s;t Month in the <HI>Gazer,</HI> namely, in that of <HI>June</HI>
the <HI>$0th.</HI> and another in that of <HI>June</HI> the 16th. preceding; both which Re|lations,
tho' they are but &s;hort and imperfect, as to what I could have wi&s;h|ed
and &s;hall indeavour to obtain, yet as they are, they will be found to contain
<PB N="417" REF="396">
many Particulars, which do very much illu&s;trate and confirm my Conjectures.
And tho' the particular effects were not &s;o great as to equalize tho&s;e which
I have &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the productions of former Eruptions, &s;uch as
the rai&s;ing of the <HI>Alpes, Pyreneans, Appennines, Andes,</HI> and the like Moun|tains,
or the making of new Lands, l&s;lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or the &s;inking of Countries,
and drowning of I&s;lands as the <HI>Platonick Atlantis</HI> and contiguous I&s;lands, yet
if they be con&s;idered they will be found to be of the &s;ame Nature, and to dif|fer
only in Magnitude, <HI>Secundum Magis &amp; Minus,</HI> but not in E&s;&s;ence.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Account is dated from <HI>Nevis, April</HI> the thirtieth, in the&s;e words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">of Earthquakes in the Lee|ward I&s;tands.</NOTE>
&startq;[On <HI>Sunday</HI> the &s;ixth In&s;tant, about five a Clock in the Evening, was, for
&s;ome few Minutes, heard a &s;trange hollow noi&s;e, which was thought to pro|ceed
from the great Mountain in the middle of this I&s;land, to the admira|tion
of all People; but immediately after, to their greater Amazement, be|gan
a mighty Earthquake, with that violence, that almo&s;t all the Hou&s;es
in <HI>Charles</HI> Town, that were built of Brick or Stone, were in an in&s;tance le|velled
with the Ground, and tho&s;e built of Timber &s;hook, that every Body
made what ha&s;t they could to get out of them. In the Streets the Ground
in &s;everal places clove about two Foot a&s;under, and hot &s;tinking Water
&s;pouted out of the Earth a great height. The Sea left its u&s;ual Bounds more
than a third of a Mile, &s;o that very large Fi&s;h lay bare upon the Shoar,
but the Water pre&s;ently returned again. And afterwards the &s;ame &s;trange
motion happened &s;everal times, but the Water retired not &s;o far as at fir&s;t.
The Earth, in many places, was thrown up in great quantities, and thou&s;|ands
of large Trees went with it, which were buried and no more &s;een.
Tis u&s;ual almo&s;t at every Hou&s;e to have a large Ci&s;tern, to contain the Rain|water
of above nine or ten Foot deep, and fifteen or twenty Foot Diameter,
&s;everal of which, with the violence of the Earthquake, threw out the Wa|ter
eight or ten Foot high; and the motion of the Earth all over the I&s;land
was &s;uch, that nothing could be more terrible. 'In the I&s;land of St. <HI>Chri|&s;tophers</HI>
(as &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen, who are come hither to treat about the
exchange of Pri&s;oners, do Report) there has likewi&s;e been an Earthquake,
the Earth opening in many places nine Foot, and burying &s;olid Timber, Su|gar-mills,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and throwing down the Je&s;uits Colledge, and all other Stone
Buildings. It was al&s;o in a manner as violent at <HI>Antego</HI> and <HI>Mont&s;errat;</HI>
and they had &s;ome feeling of it at <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> Several &s;mall Earthquakes
have happened &s;ince, three or four in twenty four Hours; &s;ome of which
made the bigge&s;t Rocks have a great motion, but we are now in great hopes
there will be no more.&endq;]</P>
<P>This is the whole of the Relation from <HI>Nevis.</HI> But the other Account&punc; from
<HI>Barbadoes,</HI> of the 23rd. of <HI>April,</HI> taketh notice of other particulars than what
are mentioned in this Letter; the Printed Account is this that follows.
[&startq;About three Weeks &s;ince there were felt mo&s;t violent Earthquakes in the
<HI>Leeward I&s;lands</HI> of <HI>Mont&s;errat, Nevit</HI> and <HI>Antego;</HI> in the two fir&s;t no con&s;i|derable
hurt was done, mo&s;t of their Buldings being of Timber; but where
there were Stone Buildings they were generally thrown down, which fell ve|ry
hard in <HI>Antego,</HI> mo&s;t of their Hou&s;es, Sugar-mills and Wind-mills being
of Stone. This Earthquake was felt in &s;ome places of this I&s;land, but did
no manner of hurt to Men or Cattle; nor was any lo&s;t in the <HI>Leeward I&s;lands,</HI>
it happening in the Day-time. It is reported to have been yet more violent
in <HI>Martinico,</HI> and other <HI>French</HI> I&s;lands. And &s;everal Sloops who came from
<HI>Nevis</HI> and <HI>Antego</HI> pa&s;&s;ing between St. <HI>$ucia</HI> and <HI>Martinico</HI> felt it at Sea: The
agitation of the Water being &s;o violent, that they thought them&s;elvcs on
Rocks and Shelves, the Ve&s;&s;els &s;haking as if they would break in pieces.
And others pa&s;&s;ing by a Rock and inhabited I&s;land, called <HI>Rodund$,</HI> found
the Earthquake &s;o violent there, that a great part of that Rocky I&s;land &s;plit
and tumbled into the Sea, and was there &s;unk, making a noi&s;e as of many
Cannon, and a very great Cloud of Du&s;t a&s;cending into the Air at the fall.&endq;]
[&startq;Two very great Comets have lately appeared in the&s;e parts of the World,
and in an Hour and a quarters time the Sea Ebbed and Flowed to an unu&s;u$l
degree three times.&endq;] In the&s;e Relations are many con&s;iderable Effects
produced, which will much confirm my former Doctrine about the Effects of
<PB N="418" REF="397">
Earthquakes. And Fir&s;t, It is very remarkable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Observables in this Earthquake</NOTE> that this Earthquake was not
confined to a &s;mall &s;pot or place of the Earth, &s;uch as the Er$ption of <HI>Ae|na</HI>
or <HI>Ve&s;uvi$s</HI> out of one Mouth, but it extended above five Degrees, or
three hundred and fifty Miles in length; namely, from <HI>Barbadoes</HI> to St. <HI>Chri|&s;tophers,</HI>
and po&s;&s;ibly, upon inquiry, it may be found to have gone a great
deal further, and to have produced Effects in <HI>Statia</HI> St. <HI>Martin, Anguilla, Por|$o
Rico,</HI> or &s;ome other of tho&s;e I&s;lands in the North-we&s;t or St. <HI>Chri&s;tophers,</HI>
where, by the Relation, it &s;eemis to have been the mo&s;t violent: And tho'
po&s;&s;ibly there might not be opportunities of fe$ling or taking notice of the
effects in all places of the Sea where it might have been felt; yet by tho&s;e
few In&s;tances which are related, we may probably conjecture, that its effects
might be very con&s;iderable, and &s;en&s;ible a great way in breadth under the Sea;
for we find that the Strokes or Succu&s;ions thereof were felt by the Ve&s;&s;els
&s;ayling over &s;ome parts of the Sea &s;o affected; and tho&s;e &s;o violent as if the
Ve&s;&s;els had &s;truck upon Rocks, which could be from nothing el&s;e but the &s;ud|dain
ri&s;ing of the bottom of the Sea, which rai&s;ed the Sea al&s;o with it, like
Water in a Tub or Di&s;h: And that this was of that Nature does further ap|pear
by the unu&s;ual Tides at the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> mentioned in the la&s;t Relation,
<HI>viz.</HI> That in an Hour and &frac14; the Sea Ebbed and Flowed three times in an un|u&s;ual
Degree; which, in probability, were nothing el&s;e but Waves propa|gated
from the places where the Ground underneath, and the Sea above, had
been by the Concu&s;&s;ions of the Earthquake rai&s;ed upwards. This appears al&s;o
farther by the rece&s;s of the Sea from the Shore at <HI>Nevis $</HI> of a Mile; for the
whole I&s;land being rai&s;ed by the Swelling or Eruption of the Vapour or Fire
underneath, made the Sea run off from the Shores, till it &s;ettled down again
into its place after the Vapour had broken its way out through the Clefts that
were made by tho&s;e Swellings: From all which Particulars, and &s;everal others,
'tis manife&s;t, that the &s;pace of Earth rai&s;ed or &s;truck upwards by the impe|tuo&s;ity
of the Subterraneous Powers that cau&s;ed it, was of great Extent, and
might far exceed the length of the <HI>Alps,</HI> or the <HI>Pyreneans,</HI> &amp;c. But there
may be other In&s;tances al&s;o produced of the great extent of the Powers or
Effects of Earthquakes, as tho&s;e I have formerly mentioned to have happened
in <HI>Norway</HI> about thirty Years &s;ince; and tho&s;e which happened in the Nor|them
parts of <HI>America</HI> of a later date.</P>
<P>Another particular notable in this, is the Rece&s;s of the Sea from the Shore,
and the leaving the Fi&s;h upon the &s;o rai&s;ed bottom; and tho' this part &s;oon
after &s;unk again, &s;o that the Sea returned to its former bounds, yet if &s;ome
other parts of the Subterraneous Ground had filled up the made Cavity, or
that they had &s;o tumbled as to &s;upport the &s;o rai&s;ed parts, In&s;tances of which
kinds of Accidents may be produced from other Earthquakes, then it would
have left &s;ome &s;uch kind of Tract as it is now in <HI>Virginia,</HI> where, for many
Miles in length, the Low-land is nothing but Sea-&s;and and Shells, which
have been, in probability, &s;o rai&s;ed into the Air, and there &s;upported and
continued from &s;inking again and being covered with the Sea: Of Shells taken
up from this Tract, there can be no doubt that they have belonged to Fi&s;h
of their kind, they remaining hitherto perfect Scallop Shells; of which kind
there are &s;ome in the Repo&s;itory.</P>
<P>A Third particular Remarkable, is the overturning and burying of thou|&s;ands
of Trees which were no more &s;een, being covered by the Earth which
was thrown up by the Eruption. This gives us a very plain In&s;tance of the
manner how Trees that are now found in divers parts of <HI>England</HI> buried un|der
the Ground, may have come to have been there &s;o di&s;po&s;ed and depo&s;it|ed;
for tho' po&s;&s;ibly in tho&s;e places there may be no &s;uch Trees now grow|ing;
and tho' we have no Hi&s;tory when there were, or of any &s;uch Eruption
that might have &s;o overturned and buried them; yet the Records that we
have of the antient or former State of tho&s;e Parts, are not &s;o full and particu|lar,
but that we may well enough &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch Cata&s;trophies may have
happened long &s;ince we have begun to have Writings and Records in <HI>England;</HI>
that is, &s;ince the time that the <HI>Romans</HI> fir&s;t conquered this I&s;le; and yet not
find any mention thereof there made; &s;ince po&s;&s;ibly tho&s;e that might be in
or near tho&s;e Parts might have peri&s;h'd with it, and tho&s;e which were at a
<PB N="419" REF="398">
di&s;tance took little notice or regard of what they had little concern for: Be|&s;ides,
in tho&s;e Days very &s;mall were the number that could Write and Read,
and fewer were tho&s;e that minded any thing the effects produced by Nature:
What was written was either &s;omewhat relating to Religion or Civil Hi&s;tory,
very few and rare are the In&s;tances that can be met with of Natural Hi&s;tory;
and it has not been a Defect peculiar to the&s;e parts of the World only, but
was taken notice of two Thou&s;and Years &s;ince by <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> upon this very ac|count,
as we find in the fourteenth Chapter of his fir&s;t Book of <HI>Meteors;</HI>
&startq;Moreover (&s;ays he in the beginning of this Chapter) the &s;ame Parts of the
Earth are not always dry Land, or always covered with Water, but they
&s;uffer a change from the ri&s;ing of new Rivers, or decay and drying of old;
therefore al&s;o in places near the Sea there are wont to happen the&s;e changes.
So that tho&s;e which are Land, or tho&s;e which are Sea do not always re|main
&s;o; but where was Land there is Sea, and where was Sea there is Land;
and we are to conclude the&s;e changes to happen according to &s;ome order.
Now (&s;ays he) becau&s;e many of the&s;e changes happen but &s;lowly in com|pari&s;on
to the quickne&s;s and &s;hortne&s;s of the Life of Man, therefore they
are hardly taken notice of, a whole Generation having pa&s;&s;ed away before
&s;uch changes have come to perfection. Other Cata&s;trophies that have been
more quick, have been forgotten, by rea&s;on that &s;uch as e&s;caped them were
removed to &s;ome other parts, and there the Memory of them was &s;oon lo&s;t;
at lea&s;t a longer tract of Time did quite obliterate the remembrance of
them, and the tran&s;planting and tran&s;migration of People from place to
place much contributed thereunto.&endq; This is made plain enough by the lit|tle
remembrance was found in <HI>America</HI> of their preceding E&s;tate, when they
were fir&s;t vi&s;ited by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and other <HI>Europeans.</HI></P>
<P>A fourth particular Remarkable in the&s;e Relations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">of the Veins Marble.</NOTE> is the Chapping and
cleaving of the Earth and Rocks, and the &s;pouting out of them of &s;tinking
Water to a great height; as al&s;o of Smoke or Du&s;t, which &s;erves to explain
the Rea&s;on and Cau&s;es of the Flaws and Veins in Marbles and other Stones;
for by the Power and Violence of the Subterraneous Heavings or Succu&s;&s;ions
the &s;tony Quarries become broken, flawed and cleft, and Subterraneous Mine|ral
Waters impregnated with Saline, Metalline, Sulphureous, or other Sub|&s;tances
are driven into them and fill them up, which having petrified Qua|lities
in them, do, in proce&s;s of time, petrify in tho&s;e Clefts, and thereby
form a &s;ort of &s;tony Veins of different Colour, Hardne&s;s, and other Quali|fications,
than what the parts of the broken Quarry had before, and oft time
inclo&s;e divers other Sub&s;tances by their petrifying Quality, which have hap|pened
to fall into tho&s;e Clefts, and thence &s;ometimes there are found Shells
petrified in the middle of the Vein, as I have &s;een, and other Sub&s;tances.
The&s;e Clifts or Chaps hapening not only upon the Land, but even under the
Sea; &s;o that not only the Sea-water may de&s;cend and fill up tho&s;e Clefts, but
it may carry with it Sands, Shells, Mud, and divers other Sub&s;tances from the
bottom of the Sea, that then lay above it, there to be, in proce&s;s of time,
changed into Stone &s;omewhat of the Nature of that which hath been &s;o
cleft.</P>
<P>Fifthly, 'Tis worth noting, that this Earthquake happened at &s;o great a
di&s;tance from the main Land and great Continent, and that the noi&s;e of the
&s;ame was fir&s;t ob&s;erved to begin at the great Mountain in the middle of the
I&s;land of <HI>Nevis,</HI> not but that it might in other parts have begun &s;ooner or
at other times; from which I draw the&s;e deductions. Fir&s;t, That it &s;eems
probable, that this great Mountain may have been formerly vi&s;ited with E|ruptions;
and po&s;&s;ibly might have been fir&s;t produced by &s;ome &s;uch Power,
and &s;o have great Cavities within its Bowels produced by &s;uch a preceding E|ruption,
the di&s;locatcd Parts not returning each to its own place. And next,
that it may hence &s;eem probable, that &s;ome &s;uch preceding Earthquake (tho'
then po&s;&s;ibly more violent before the foment of the Fire was by inkindling
exhau&s;ted) might, not only be the cau&s;e of rai&s;ing this Mountain, but of
lifting up from the bottom the whole I$le, nay, po&s;&s;ibly of all the I&s;lands of
the <HI>Antilles,</HI> &s;ince one &s;eems as po&s;&s;ible as the other, and the Northern of them
all &s;eems to hint as much, if con&s;idered, in the Map; be&s;ides, there &s;eems to
<PB N="420" REF="399">
be many In&s;tances of a like Nature, as in the <HI>Canaries, Tenariff</HI> &s;eems to be
a mo&s;t remarkable Character of &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition; to this may be added
<HI>Del Fuogo</HI> among the <HI>Azores</HI> and the I&s;land of <HI>Madera, Sicily, Strombulo,</HI> and
<HI>Lipary</HI> in the <HI>Mediterranean, I&s;eland</HI> in the North Sea, <HI>Ma&s;carenos</HI> near <HI>Ma|daga&s;car;</HI>
to this I may al&s;o add the many I&s;lands of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> which,
tho' they have now no great &s;igns of burning Mountains, yet to this Day
Earthquakes are very frequent, and antient Traditions do pre&s;erve &s;ome|what
of the memory of very great alterations that have happened tho&s;e
Parts by &s;uch &s;orts of Cau&s;es; but I will not now meddle with that kind of
Hi&s;tory, nor of Mythology, having &s;aid more concerning if in a more pro|per
place; but I &s;hall rather on this occa&s;ion take notice of tho&s;e I&s;lands
that have <HI>Vulcanoes</HI> in or near them, which to me &s;eem to proceed from the
&s;ame Cau&s;e and Principle. And I do not que&s;tion, but that all tho&s;e I&s;lands
which lie &s;o far in the Sea, if they were thoroughly examined, would plainly
manife&s;t whence they have proceeded by Characters of Nature's Writing,
which to me &s;eems far beyond any other Record what &s;oever. Here I conceive
it Lawful and Philo&s;ophical to <HI>Jurare in Verba,</HI> when Nature &s;peaks or dictates;
however, I &s;hall leave it free to every one to judge, as he thinks mo&s;t rea&s;on|able.</P>
<P>Sixthly, 'Tis very remarkable that the I&s;le of <HI>Rodunda,</HI> which it &s;eems is
all an uninhabited Rock, was &s;plit, and a part of it tumbled down and &s;unk
into the Sea; upon which occa&s;ion it &s;eems it made a prodigious noi&s;e as of
many Cannon, and &s;ending up at the &s;ame time a great Cloud of Du&s;t, as
they term it, which, in probability, was al&s;o mingled with Smoak. Which
puts me in mind of the Phaenomena I ob&s;erved lately, when the Pouder-mill
and Magazine at <HI>Hackny</HI> blew up; for be&s;ides the very great noi&s;e of the
Blow which I heard, being within a Mile of it, in the Fields, I ob&s;erved im|mediately,
a great white Cloud of Smoke to ri&s;e in a Body to a great height
in the Air, and to be carried by the Wind for two Miles and better without
di&s;per&s;ing or falling down, but perfectly re&s;embling the white Summer Clouds:
But this only by the bye. From the&s;e Phaenomena of the Earthquake it &s;eems
very probable, that it proceeded from &s;uch&punc; Subterraneous in kindling as re|&s;embles
Gun-powder, both by the noi&s;e it yielded, and in the &s;uddenne&s;s of
its firing, and its powerful Expan&s;ion when fired; for the noi&s;e was as of ma|ny
Cannon; this alone proves it to be very &s;uddain. Next the &s;plitting of
the Rocky I&s;land proves its Power to be very great; this is proved yet farther
by the Blow and Strokes it communicated to the Sea, and &s;o to the Ships
that $ailed upon it; for no &s;low motion whatever could have communicated
&s;uch a Concu&s;&s;ion through the Water to the Ve&s;&s;els upon it; but it mu&s;t be as
&s;uddain as that of Pouder, otherwise the &s;troke of the Earth upon the in|cumbent
Seas, would never have had the like &s;ucce&s;s; for if it had been a
gradual rising of the bottom, the Sea would gradually have run off from it,
and upon its &s;inking again have gradually returned, and the Ve&s;&s;els on it
would only have been &s;en&s;iblc at mo&s;t but of a Current or Running of the
Water to or from the place &s;inking or ri&s;ing, &s;omewhat like the effect that
happened at <HI>Nevis;</HI> which doth plainly &s;hew, that, be&s;ides the &s;uddain
Strokes or Concu&s;&s;ions, there was al&s;o a con&s;iderable ri&s;ing aud &s;inking of the
whole I&s;land as to the level of the Sea. But that which I principally note un|der
this Head is, that a good part of the &s;aid I&s;land tumbled down and was
&s;unk into the Sea, which gives an account how many parts of the Earth
come to be buried under Ground and di&s;placed from their former Situations,
and thence how Ships, Ankers, Bones, Teeth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that have &s;ometimes been
digged up from great depths, may have come to be there buried.</P>
<P>Seventhly, 'Tis remarkable al&s;o, that this Eruption &s;ent up into the Air
great Clouds of Du&s;t and Smoke, which for the most part mu&s;t &s;oon fall down
again into the Sea, or contiguous parts of the I&s;land. This will give a pro|bable
account how the Layers of the Superficial Parts of the Earth may come
to be made; for the bigger part of this Du&s;t mu&s;t come down to the bottom
fir&s;t and &s;ettle to a certain thickne&s;s and make a Bed of Gravel, then will
follow Beds of coar&s;e Sand, then Beds of finer and finer Sand, and la&s;t of
Clays or Moulds of &s;everal &s;orts; again much of that which fell upon the
<PB N="421" REF="400">
higher parts of the I&s;land, will, by the Rivers, be wa&s;hed down into the
Vales, and there produce the like Beds or Layers of &s;everal kinds, and &s;o
bury many of the parts that were before on the Surface. Thus Plants and
Vegetable Sub&s;tances may come to be buried, and the Bones and Teeth of the
Carca&s;&s;es of Dead Animals: The&s;e may al&s;o &s;ometimes be buried under Beds
or Cru&s;ts of Stone, when the parts that thus make the Layers chance to be
mixed with &s;uch Subterraneous Sub&s;tances as carry with them a petrifying
Quality. But I &s;hall not detain you any longer with farther Deductions from
the&s;e few Remarks we find in the&s;e two ca&s;ual Relations of this Earthquake;
I &s;hall only add, that I could heartily with that &s;ome care were taken that a
more particular account might be procured of it whil&s;t the effects thereof are
fre&s;h in Memory, that they might be Recorded and added to the Collections
of Natural Hi&s;tory. And for the &s;ame end it were de&s;ireable to know what
former. Earthquakes have been taken notice of in the&s;e, or any other of the&s;e
I&s;lands, as <HI>Jamaica, Cuba, Hi&s;paniola, Porto Rico,</HI> &amp;c. for that the Memory
of &s;uch Accidents, if they be not Collected and Recorded whil&s;t the Specta|tors
are in being, are &s;oon forgotten and lo&s;t or not regarded by the &s;uc|ceding
Generations, as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> has taken notice of al&s;o in the Chapter I be|fore
quoted.</P>
<P>What is mo&s;t remarkable in the&s;e Earthquakes in the <HI>Leeward</HI> I&s;lands, is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why I&s;land &amp; Sea-Co$&s;ts are mo&s;t &s;ubject to Earthquakes.</NOTE>
that they have all happened to places not far di&s;tant from the Sea, or even
under the Sea it&s;elf, though the Eruptions have been, for the mo&s;t part on
the Land. So that there doth &s;eem to be &s;omewhat of Rea&s;on to Conjecture
as <HI>Signior Bottoni</HI> in his <HI>Pyrologia Topographica,</HI> that the &s;aline Quality of the
Sea-water may conduce to the producing of the Subterraneous Fermentation
with the Sulphureous Minerals there placed, which the Experiment lately here
exhibited at a Meeting of this Society, does yet make more probable; for
by that it was evident, that the mixing of Spirit of Salt with Iron, did pro|duce
&s;uch a Fermentation as did produce a Vapour or Steem, which by an
actual Flame was immediately fired like Gun-pouder, and if inclo&s;ed, would,
in all probability, have had a like effect of rai&s;ing and di&s;per&s;ing of tho&s;e
parts that bounded and impri&s;oned it. Now, 'tis evident that the melted
Matter which was vomited out of <HI>Aetna</HI> the Year &s;ixty nine (of which we
have a part now in the Repo&s;itory) was very much like to melted or ca&s;t Iron,
and I doubt not but that there may be much of that mineral in it; be&s;ides,
the Foot of the of that Mountain does extend even to the very sea, and in all pro|bability
may have Caverns under the Sea it&s;elf, which is argued al&s;o from the Concurrency of the Conflagration of <HI>Strombolo</HI> and <HI>Lipary,</HI> I&s;lands con&s;iderably di|&s;tant
from it by Sea, at the &s;ame time, where it is generally believed that
there may be Subterraneous Cavernous Pa&s;&s;ages between them, by which they
communicate to one another; &s;o that &s;ometimes it begins in <HI>Aetna,</HI> and is
communicated to <HI>Strombolo,</HI> and reciprocally communicated to <HI>Mongibel.</HI></P>
<P>This po&s;&s;ibly may afford a probable Rea&s;on why I&s;lands are now more &s;ub|ject
to Earthquakes than Continents and inland Parts; and indeed how &s;o
many I&s;lands came to be di&s;per&s;ed up and down in the Sea, namely, for that
the&s;e Fermentations may have been cau&s;ed in the parts of the Earth &s;ubja|cent
to the Sea, which being brought a Head of Ripene&s;s, may have ta|ken
Fire, and &s;o have had force enough to rai&s;e a &s;ufficient quantity of the
Earth above it, to make its way through the Sea, and there make it&s;elf a
vent, as the of that <HI>Canaries</HI> did in the Year 39, which, if &s;ufficiently copi|ous,
may produce an I&s;land as that did al&s;o for a time, though it hath &s;ince
that time again &s;unk under the Surface of the Sea. But the I&s;land_of <HI>A&s;cen|&s;ion;</HI>
which, by all appearances, doth &s;eem to have been the &s;ame way pro|duced,
doth &s;till remain as a witne&s;s to prove this Hypothe&s;is. A like Te&s;ti|mony
to this, of the Cau&s;e and Manner of their Production, I take the I&s;land
and Pike of <HI>Tenariff</HI> to be, &s;o <HI>Hecla</HI> of <HI>Iceland,</HI> &s;o <HI>Bearenberg of John Mayens</HI>
or <HI>Trinity I&s;land,</HI> &s;o <HI>del Fuego</HI> of the Icelnd, of <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> &s;o <HI>Ternate</HI> o$ the
<HI>Moluccas,</HI> and the I&s;land of <HI>Ma&s;carenas,</HI> of the I&s;lands about <HI>Madaga&s;|car</HI>
among the <HI>Antillas on Caribes,</HI> all which do &s;eem to me to be remaining
Te&s;timonies how, and in what manner, and by what means tho&s;e other I&s;lands
which have now worn out the marks of their fir&s;t Origination, were at fir&s;t
<PB N="422" REF="401">
produced. And tho' the Fires be extinct in many of the other I&s;lands, yet
tis observable, that the prodigious high Mountains or Sugar-lo$e Pikes or
Hills do yet remain as marks of what they had been heretofore; &s;o the Pike
of <HI>Fayal.</HI> among the <HI>Terceras,</HI> and the whole I&s;land of St. <HI>Helena,</HI> and &s;everal
others of tho&s;e about <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> and of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and of tho&s;e of the
<HI>Antilles,</HI> and that of St. <HI>Martha</HI> mentioned by <HI>Dampire,</HI> do &s;eem to me to be
plain evidences of the former and Original Cau&s;es of them all.</P>
<P>Nor do I in the lea&s;t doubt but that an inqui&s;itive Per&s;on who &s;hould pur|po&s;ely
&s;urvey all other I&s;lands that wanted the&s;e Marks or Tokens of &s;uch
Eruptions, might find enough of other Indications to manife&s;t by what means
they &s;o came to be placed in the Sea, &s;o far from any part of the Continents
they are oppo&s;ite to. Nor do I conceive they were all thus formed at once,
but rather &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, &s;ome in one, &s;ome in other Ages of the World, which
may probably be in &s;ome mea&s;ure collected from the quantity or thickne&s;s of
the Soil or Mould upon them fit for Vegetation; whence the I&s;land of <HI>A&s;cen|&s;ion</HI>
may be rationally concluded to have been a Production of not many Ages,
and the <HI>Bermoodas</HI> also of not very many more, becau&s;e of the thinne&s;s of
&s;uch a Soil. So al&s;o the I&s;land of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and &s;ome others, who&s;e
Mould is yet but thin in re&s;pect of what it is in &s;ome others, and e&s;pecially
in tho&s;e of greater Magnitude and in the greater Continents.</P>
<P>Hereupon po&s;&s;ibly it may be inquired why tho&s;e greater i&s;ands and Con|tinents'
&s;hould be of greater Antiquity than the &s;maller Islands. To which I
an&s;wer, that in the fir&s;t&punc; Ages of the World there were much greater Maga|zines,
or Stores of the Materials fitted for this purpo&s;e, which being fir&s;t
kindled threw up from under the Sea, with which they were covered, va&s;t
quantities of it all at once, and thereupon tho&s;e Magazines became in a manner
exhau&s;ted, yet not &s;o totally as not to leave &s;ome &s;maller parcells of tho&s;e
Sub&s;tances &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, as not to be ready for inkindling together with tho&s;e
greater; be&s;ides there remained other &s;maller parcels of it di&s;po&s;ed and
placed in other parts of the Globe &s;ufficiently di&s;tant from them, not to be
affected or inkindled at the &s;ame time, as tho&s;e I have mentioned to have
been the cau&s;es of the I&s;lands far di&s;tant from the Continents. Nor do I con|ceive
that all tho&s;e Clu&s;ters were all thrown up at once, as the <HI>Greecian</HI> I&s;lands
in the <HI>Archipelago</HI> the <HI>East-Indian</HI> in that part called the <HI>South-sea,</HI> the <HI>Maldi|via
I&s;lands</HI> near the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar,</HI> the I&s;lands &s;cattered at the North of <HI>Ma|daga&s;car,</HI>
the I&s;lands to the South-we&s;t of St. <HI>Helena</HI> in the
<HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean,
<HI>Finidada dos picos,</HI> the I&s;les of <HI>Cape $erd, Canaries, Tercer$s, Orcades,</HI> &amp;c.
al&s;o the <HI>Gallopegas</HI> and others in the <HI>Pacifick</HI> sea or <HI>Mar del Zur;</HI> but rather
that &s;ome were made in one Age, &s;ome in other Ages of the World. And
this was timed as the &s;everal Magazines came to be ripened and then fired;
they only indicating, as I conceive, that in tho&s;e places of the Terre&s;trial
Globe, there were placed the proper min$ral Fomen$s or Seeds as it were of
them, which, when the convenient times were come and accompli&s;hed, then
they were put into Act, and then they produced their Effects, which are the
I&s;lands that now remain the la&s;ting Monuments of them. Nor can I &s;uppo&s;e
that all the Magazines of the Earth of this kind are blown up and &s;pent, but
that there may be many other yet remaining for future Ages&punc; to be made &s;en|&s;ible
of their Effects. Nor can I be fully &s;atisfied that all the main Conti|nents
were thrown up or made Land all at once. Nor have we any proof
that the Continent of <HI>America</HI> was in the time of <HI>Noab's</HI> Flood, nor indeed
how large the habitable World then was, but certain we are, that what was
then in being was all overflowed and drowned by it, and all living Creatures,
except tho&s;e pre&s;erved in the Ark with <HI>Noah,</HI> peri&s;hed by it. But whether
the dry Land that appeared after the Flood, were the &s;ame with that before
the Flood, is a que&s;tion not ea&s;ily determinable&punc; to me it &s;eems that the pre|ceding
Earth was wholly changed and de&s;troyed, and that there was
Pro|duced
a new Earth, which before that had not appeared; and this Doctrine
&s;eems to be indicated by that Text in <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> v$. 13. <HI>And God &s;aid unto</HI> Noah,
<HI>the end of all Fle&s;h is come before me; for the Earth is filled with violence through
them, and behold I will destroy them with the Earth.</HI> And again <HI>Chap. viii. 21.
I will not again cur&s;e the ground any more for Man's &s;ake.</HI> And 2 Pet$. iii 5. <HI>By
<PB N="423" REF="402">
the word of God the Heavens were of old, and the Earth &s;tanding in the Water and
out of the Water.</HI> (ver. 6.) <HI>Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with
Water, peri&s;hed.</HI> But the clearing this Doctrine by the Expre&s;&s;ions in Scrip|ture
I &s;hall leave to the Divines; nor &s;hall I in the lea&s;t interfere with them:
However, it &s;eems to me, that the Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Breaking up the Fountains of
the great Deep,</HI> might &s;ignify the rai&s;ing up of the bottom of the Sea; and the
<HI>Water prevailing &s;o as to cover the top of the highe&s;t Mountains,</HI> might denote to
us the &s;inking or &s;ub&s;iding of the former part of the dry Ground: So as <HI>the
former was wholly drowned and de&s;troyed,</HI> which was <HI>Cur&s;ed for Man's &s;ake,</HI> &s;o a
new one was rai&s;ed, which God promi&s;ed &s;hould not be <HI>Cur&s;ed for Man's &s;ake,</HI> as
the former had been; but this only by the bye. Certain I am that I have ne|ver
yet met with my &s;elf, or heard of any other that hath any Records of the
Age of <HI>America,</HI> which, for any thing appears, may have been much younger
than the Flood of <HI>Noah:</HI> Nay, I believe it will be pretty difficult to prove e|ven
the&s;e I&s;lands of <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> to have been in being ever
&s;ince that Flood, and much more that there were &s;uch before it. And tho'
&s;ome may Conjecture that they have been &s;o (which is the mo&s;t that any one
can do) yet others may Conjecture that they have not (which is every deal as
valid). The &s;ame may be &s;aid of a very great part of the Earth, without
any tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon our Faith or Religion; nay, it was we know, not long
&s;ince, that a Bi&s;hop was condemned of Here&s;y becau&s;e he a&s;&s;erted Antipodes.
So skillful were &s;ome of our Fore-fathers in the Geography of the Habitable
Parts of the World, or of the Figure of the Earth; and I do very much
que&s;tion, whether any Inhabitant of <HI>Europe, A&s;ia,</HI> or <HI>Africa</HI> had ever any know|ledge
of <HI>America,</HI> till within the&s;e last three hundred Years. But my pre&s;ent
&s;ubject is not &s;o properly to &s;earch and inquire into the Hi&s;tory, as to find out
what have been the Natural or Phy&s;ical Cau&s;es of their Productions, Situa|tions
and Forms, and that, I think, I have &s;hewn to have been in probabili|ty
&s;ome preceding Earthquakes, which Earthquakes may have been, cau&s;ed
by Subterraneous Fermentations$ and Accen&s;ions.</P>
<P>But &s;ome perhaps may except again&s;t this Doctrine as &s;uppo&s;ing it Deroga|tory
to Divine Providence to a&s;&s;ert any other Cau&s;e but the immediate Hand
of God. To which I An&s;wer, That 'tis not denying of Providence to in|quire
into, or to a&s;&s;ign the Proximate Cau&s;es of Phaenomena in Phy&s;ical Sub|jects.
For that we have In&s;tances in the &s;acred Scriptures of &s;uch Explica|tions,
as in the ca&s;e of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> through the Red Sea; where 'tis &s;aid,
<HI>The Lord cau&s;ed an Ea&s;t Wind to $word$, which made the Sea to go back and to leave
the bottom dry Ground.</HI> And at the Waters of <HI>Marah</HI> God &s;hewed <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> a
Tree, which, when he had ca&s;t into the Waters, the Waters were made
&s;weet. So in the De&s;cription of the Deluge, we find that God cau&s;ed it$ to
Rain forty Days and forty Nights, and the Foundations of the great Deep
to be broken up, and the Windows of Heaven to be opened; which denote
by what Natural Means God was plea&s;ed to effect and Collect the great quan|tity
of Water that was to drown and overflow the then Habitable Earth;
and many other &s;uch In&s;tances there are to be met with in Holy Writ, where
the Phy&s;ical Cau&s;es are explained, for it is the &s;ame Omnipotent Power
which does influence the remote Cau&s;es as well as the proximate; and the
univer&s;al Providence that ordereth all the effects, doth al&s;o determine and
appoint all the Cau&s;es and Means conducing thereunto; nor is there a nece&s;|&s;ity
of &s;uppo&s;ing new created Cau&s;es for all the effects that we are ignorant
how they are brought to pa&s;s, or to believe every thing effected &s;upernatur|ally,
of which we cannot find out the Natural Cau&s;e; the Divine Providence
is not le&s;s Con&s;picuous in every Production that we call Natural, and think
we know the Cau&s;es of it, than in tho&s;e we are le&s;s skillful and knowing in:
'Tis the Contemplation of the wonderful Order, Law and Power of that, we
call Nature, that does mo&s;t magnify the Beauty and Excellency of the Divine
Providence, which has &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, ordered, adapted and impowered each
part &s;o to operate, as to produce the wonderful Effects which we &s;ee;
I &s;ay wonderful, becau&s;e every natural Production may be truly &s;aid to be a Won|der
or Miracle, if duly con&s;idered; for who can tell the Cau&s;e of the
Growth, Form, Figure, and all the Qualifications and peculiar Proprieties
<PB N="424" REF="403">
of each&punc; or any one Vegetable or Animal Species or individual? An ob&s;er|ving&punc;
Naturali&s;t may perhaps tell the Steps or Degrees he has taken notice of
in its Progre&s;s from the Seed to the Seed: Again, how he has ob&s;erved the
Seed to &s;$rout, how that Sprout increa&s;eth and forms it&s;elf of this or that
Magnitude; Shape, Colour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and how it produceth &s;uch a Flower, and
after that Flower &s;uch other$ Seeds as that from which it &s;prung: He may al&s;o
tell the Times and Sea&s;ons in which the&s;e Progre&s;&s;es have been or will be per|formed;
but if it be inquired how the Progre&s;&s;es come to be acted, what is
the moving Power, or what is the inlivening Principle that orders, di&s;po&s;es,
governs and performs all the&s;e wonderful Effects, there he finds the <HI>N$
plus ultra&punc;</HI> there is the Miracle that he may truly admire but cannot under|&s;tand;
however, <HI>E&s;t aliquid prodire tenus &s;i non datur ultra,</HI> let us fir&s;t find the
proximate Cau&s;es, and then proceed to the more remote; I think no one
ought to be blamed or di&s;couraged from &s;earching after the&s;e Cau&s;es and Rea|&s;ons
of Natural Productions &s;o far as the Powers he is endowed with will en|able
him; for this will more powerfully convince him of a Divine Providence
that Rules and Regulates the things of this World, than all the other me|thods
of Contemplation or Argumentation what&s;oever.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD><DATE>July 30. 1699.</DATE> A Di&s;cour&s;e of the Cau&s;es of Earthq$akes.</HEAD>
<P>I mentioned in &s;ome Lectures that the Earth did &s;eem to grow old and to
have lo&s;t many of tho&s;e Parts, which, in the younger times of the World, it
&s;eemed to me to have more abounded with; that which I in&s;tanced in, was
the Foment or Materials that &s;erve to produce and effect&punc; Conflagrations, E|ruptions,
or Earthquakes. The&s;e Materials I conceive to be &s;omewhat an|alogous
to the Materials of Gun-pouder, not that they mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;arily the
very &s;ame, either as to the Parts or as to the Manner and Order of Compo|&s;ition,
or as to the way of Inkindling and Accen&s;ion; for that as much the
&s;ame Effect may be produced by differing Agents, &s;o the Methods and Order
of proceeding may be altogether as differing: A clear In&s;tance of this we may
find in the phaenomena of Lightning, wherein we may ob&s;erve, that the Effects
are very like to the Effects of Gun-pouder.</P>
<P>For we have fir&s;t the fla&s;h of Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">of Lightning and Thunder.</NOTE> which is very &s;uddain, very bright,
and of very &s;hort continuance, being almo&s;t momentan$ous, at lea&s;t every
&s;ingle fla&s;h is &s;o, tho' the kindling of &s;everal parts at &s;ome di&s;tance from one
another does &s;ometimes continue a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or longer duration of the
Light.</P>
<P>Next we may ob&s;erve the violence of the Crack or Noi&s;e which is likewi&s;e
as $omentaneous as the Fire, if it be &s;ingle, but if there be many particular
fla&s;hes that contribute to this effect, and tho&s;e made at &s;everal di&s;tances, then
the duration of the Thunder heard is longer than the duration of the fla&s;hes
of Lightning, which proceeds, as I conceive, from two Cau&s;es; Fir&s;t, For
that tho&s;e fla&s;hes that are farther di&s;tant, have their Thunder a longer time
in pa&s;&s;ing to the Ear, than tho&s;e which are nearer, by rea&s;on, that tho' the
Pa&s;&s;age or Motion of Light be almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous, vet the progre&s;&s;ion or
motion of &s;ound is temporaneous, and requires a certain &s;en&s;ible time to
pa&s;s a &s;en&s;ible &s;$ace, and the times are proportionably longer as the &s;paces
pa&s;&s;ed are greate. But a &s;econd Cau&s;e of the duration of the Thunder, I
conceive, proceeds from Echoes that are rebounded both from parts of the
Earth, and likewi&s;e parts of the Air, $ as from charged Clouds; of both
which I am &s;en&s;ibly a&s;&s;ured both by natural Rea&s;oning and from &s;en&s;ible Ob|&s;ervations,
and I have ob&s;erved much the &s;ame Effects produced by the Echoe|ing
and Rebounding of the &s;ound of a peice or Ordnance, from places at
&s;everal di&s;tances adapted for the production of &s;uch Repercu&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>But, Thirdly, We have al&s;o the Power and Violence of the force of the
Fire and Expan&s;ion, in fireing &s;everal things that are Combu&s;tible, in &s;ud|denly
melting of Metals and other Materials, which are difficult and flow
enough otherwi&s;e to be made to flow, in rending, ta$ng, throwing down and
de&s;troying whatever &s;tands in its way, and the like; and yet after all, that
<PB N="425" REF="404">
which cau&s;eth the&s;e and many other &s;trange Effects re&s;embling tho&s;e of Gun-pouder,
&s;eems to be nothing but a Vapour or Steem mixed with the Body of
the Air, which is inkindled, not by any actual Fire, but by a kind of Fer|mentation
or inward working of the &s;aid Vapour. Again, we find that the
<HI>Pulvis Fulminans</HI> as 'tis called, which hath &s;ome of its materials differing from
that of common Pouder; as al&s;o <HI>Aurum Fulminans,</HI> which is yet more differ|ing
both as to its materials and as to its way of kindling, have yet mo&s;t of
the &s;ame effects with Gun-pouder, both as to the fla&s;hing and thund$ring Noi&s;e,
and as to the Force or Violence. So that as the&s;e are differing in many par|ticulars,
and yet produce much the &s;ame effects; &s;o 'tis probable, that what
is the cau&s;e of Earthquakes and Subterraneous Thundring, Lightning and vi|olent
Expan&s;ion, as I may &s;o call tho&s;e Phaenomena ob&s;ervable in tho&s;e <HI>Cri&s;es</HI>
of Nature, may be in divers particulars differing from every one of the&s;e,
both as to the materials, and as to the form and manner of Accen&s;ion, and
yet as to the Effects they may be very Analogous and Similar. So that tho'
I cannot po&s;&s;ibly prove what the materials are, yet the Effects &s;peak them to
be &s;omewhat Analogous to tho&s;e of Gun-pouder, or <HI>Pulvis Fulminans, Aurum
Fulminans</HI> or Lightning, which, tho' they &s;eem very differing in many parti|culars,
yet when I come to &s;hew the Cau&s;es and Rea&s;ons of tho&s;e Effects, I
&s;hall manife&s;t, that 'tis but one Operation in Nature, and that which cau&s;es
the effect in one causes the effect in all the re&s;t, and the outward appearances
of the differing materials, and the differing way of Operating, are nothing
but the Habits, and Dre&s;&s;es, and Vizards of the Actors, and the differing
Modes and Dances by which they Act their &s;everal Parts, which, when they
have done, they are at an end, and have exerted their whole Power, and
there mu&s;t be a new &s;et of Actors to do the &s;ame thing again; the Oil of the
Lamp will be turned all into Flame, but you mu&s;t have fre&s;h Oil, if you will
have the Fl$me continued. So the Materials that make the Subterraneous
Flame or Fire, or Expan&s;ion, call it by which name you plea&s;e, is con&s;umed
and converted to another Sub&s;tance, not fit to produce any more the &s;ame
Effect; and if the Confiagration be &s;o great as to con&s;ume&punc; all the pre&s;ent
Store, you might &s;afely conclude that place would no more be troubled with
&s;uch Effects;<NOTE PLACE="marg">All things are in a perpetual charg$.</NOTE> but if there be remainders left, either already fit and prepared,
but &s;helteredd from Accen&s;ion by other interpo&s;ing incombu&s;tible Materials;
Or that there be other parts not thoroughly Ripe, and &s;ufficiently prepared
for &s;uch Accen&s;ion, then a concurrence of after Cau&s;es may repeat the &s;ame
Effects, and that <HI>toties quoties</HI> till all the Mine be exhau&s;ted, which I look up|on
as a thing not only po&s;&s;ible, but probable, nay, nece&s;&s;ary, for that I find
it to be the general method of Nature, which is always going forward, and
continually making a progre&s;s of changing all things from the State in which
it finds them in at the pre&s;ent; all things as they proceed to their Perfection,
&s;o they proceed al&s;o to their Di&s;&s;olution and Corruption, as to their preced|ing
E&s;tate; and where Nature repeats the proce&s;s, 'tis always on a new In|dividual.</P>
<P>Now, tho' it may be Objected, of the material that produceth Lightn|ing,
tho' it &s;eemeth to be all kindled and &s;o burnt off by the fla&s;h, yet we
find that after &s;ome time the &s;ame is again renewed, and &s;o from time to
time, and therefore as one Operation doth de&s;troy and con&s;ume it, &s;o ano|ther
doth generate and produce it anew, and therefore it doth &s;eem pro|bable
that the &s;ame may be done in the Subterraneous Regions, and thence,
tho' there were many Accen&s;ions and Con&s;umings of the foment of Earth|quakes
in former Ages, yet if Nature did thus again repair it, there would
be little rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that former Earthquakes &s;hould be greater than
tho&s;e which have in later, or in this pre&s;ent Age, been ob&s;erved; to which
I An&s;wer, That tho' it &s;eem plain, that the foment of Lightning is renewed,
yet I conceive that to be only by new Emanations from the proper Minerals
in the Body of the Earth, and not for that the &s;ame Sub&s;tance which is burnt
off in the Lightning, is again re&s;tored into its former State and made fit for
a &s;econd Accen&s;ion, for tho' there may be nece&s;&s;ary a praevious Dige&s;tion of
the Steams, which is performed by the Air and heat of the
Weather, yet that
does only prepare it with a proper fitne&s;s, but it mu&s;t be &s;ome proper Mine|ral
<PB N="426" REF="405">
that mu&s;t furni&s;h the Materials: And the &s;ame thing is more evident in
<HI>V$lcanoes</HI> and burning Mountains, which are there only oberved to break
forth and burn where there is plenty of Brim&s;tone and other proper Sub|&s;tances
for &s;uch Conflagrations; for if the &s;ame were only a continual new
Generation of Combu&s;tible Materials for the Fire, then I &s;ee no Rea&s;on why
those <HI>Incendiums</HI> &s;hould not be equally frequent and equally great in all places,
as well as in tho&s;e where they are now frequently ob&s;erved; for why &s;hould
it not as frequently happen in our Hills and Mountains, as it does in <HI>Sicily,</HI>
or <HI>I&s;land,</HI> in <HI>Aetna,</HI> or <HI>Hecla,</HI> the one being as much colder then we, as we
are then the other? It follows therefore, that it mu&s;t be caus&s;ed, not by the
Renovation of the Foment, but from the Duration of the Mines or Mine|rals
that &s;upply fit Materials, and con&s;equently, that when tho&s;e &s;hall be quite
con&s;umed, then, and not 'till then will the Fire go quite out. Nay that there
are &s;ome &s;uch In&s;tances of preceding <HI>Vulcanoes,</HI> which have heretofore burn|ed
and are now almo&s;t quite &s;pent, may be concluded from the <HI>Pike of Tena|riff,</HI>
which, by all Circum&s;tances, &s;eems to have been formerly a burning
Mountain, but is now quite extinct, and the I&s;land of <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion</HI> &s;eems to be
another &s;uch an In&s;tance. All which Conflagrations are the &s;everal Symp|toms
of the progre&s;s of Nature in the determined Cour&s;e and Method,
which, tho' it be differing from that of Life or Vegetation in le&s;&s;er Bodies,
yet it may be po&s;&s;ibly as Natural and Nece&s;&s;ary in the greater.</P>
<P>I cannot therefore &s;ee any Ab&s;urdity in thinking or a&s;&s;erting that this Globe
of the Earth on which we inhabit is in a &s;tate of Progre&s;&s;ion from one degree
of Perfection to that of an other degree, which may be termed of Perfection,
for as much as it is the Progre&s;s and Operation of Nature; and at the &s;ame
time it may be conceived in a progre&s;s to Corruption and Di&s;&s;olut$on in as
much as it continually changed from its preceding State, and acquires a new
and differing one from what it had before, which new E&s;tate may be upon
&s;ome accounts con&s;idered as more perfect, tho' upon other accounts it may be
accounted corrupting and tending to its final Di&s;&s;olution; and as 'tis certain
that it is continually older in re&s;pect of Time and Duration, &s;o I conceive al|&s;o
that it grows older as to its Con&s;titution and Powers, and that there have
been many more Effects produced by it in its more Juvenile E&s;tate, than it doth
or it can now produce in its more Senile, as more particularly to Earthquakes
and Eruptions; for to me it &s;eems mo&s;t evident and pa&s;t doubting, that
there have been in &s;ome preceding Ages of the World Eruptions and Confla|grations
which have infinitely &s;urpa&s;&s;ed any that have happened of later Years,
or indeed any that we have any certain account of in Hi&s;tory. Some kind
of Memory of &s;ome antient Traditions concerning a very great one that
&s;ometimes happened, &s;eems to be pre&s;erved by the Poetical or Mythological
Hi&s;tory of <HI>Phaeton,</HI> of which <HI>Plato</HI> al&s;o tells us, that the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> had a
more perfect knowledge and account, than ever the <HI>Greeks</HI> were Ma&s;ters of,
who, at be&s;t, as to Hi&s;tories of preceding Ages, were by the <HI>Aegyptian</HI>
Priests, accounted but Boys and Children; however, <HI>Ovid,</HI> by his wording of
that Fable, does &s;eem plainly to have had &s;ome knowledge of what was mean$
or under&s;tood thereby; and tho' he &s;eems to a&s;cribe the Cau&s;e thereof to
&s;ome extraordinary heat of the Sun, yet that might be nothing el&s;e but the
relating the Opinion of the Antients pre&s;erved by the &s;ame Tradition, by
which the Memory of the Prodigious effects that had been wrought had been
retained.</P>
<P>In which ca&s;e we are to di&s;tingui&s;h between Hi&s;tories of Matters of
Fact, and tho&s;e of Opinion; and <HI>Plato</HI> takes notice of as much when he men|tions
of Relation. The Matters of Fact &s;eem to have been the Conflagra|tion
of many parts of Earth at once, and tho&s;e the mo&s;t eminent, &s;uch
as the Mountains, which, whether they were in being before the Conflagra|tion,
or made by that Eruption, does not appear by the Story, but it &s;eems
mo&s;t probable, that that was the time of their Production; and the calling of
them by &s;everal Names, yet retained, does &s;ignify no more, but that tho&s;e
Mountains, which are now called &s;o or &s;o, were then on Fire and burning.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="406">
But having before explain'd this Fable of <HI>Phaeton,</HI> and &s;everal others of
that ingenious Mythologick Poet <HI>Ovid,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Earthquakes formerly more frequent, and why.</NOTE> I &s;hall for bear the repetition o$ them
here, and for the pre&s;ent would only infer, that in former and younger Ages
of the World tho&s;e kind of effects, produced by Eruptions and Earthquakes,
have been much more con&s;iderable than tho&s;e which are now produced, or
which have been produc'd &s;ince we have had any Records kept of &s;uch Events;
and therefore we are not to conclude that &s;uch huge Mountains, as the <HI>Alpes,</HI>
the <HI>Andes, Cauca&s;us, Atlas,</HI> or the like, could never be produced by means
of Earthquakes or Eruptions, becau&s;e we do not now find In&s;tances of Effects
of the &s;ame Grandure produced in our pre&s;ent Age, or in the Ages of which
we have &s;ome more perfect account; for that in the former Ages there have
been a much greater plenty of tho&s;e kinds of Minerals which have been con|&s;umed,
and for that the Relicts which are now left are but very &s;mall, and
in probability not &s;o apt for Conflagration, nor &s;o &s;trong and efficacious in
their Operations; be&s;ides many of their Sub&s;tances that were left may have
&s;ince been petrify'd and converted into Sub&s;tances, wholly unfit for the Fo|ment
or Fuell of &s;uch kinds of Fire; for that &s;uch Mutations have been ef|fected
by length of Time, I think no one that has ob&s;erv'd and con&s;ider'd the
Nature of Petrifaction can at all doubt, any more than he can whether there
be any &s;uch Sub&s;tance as Stone; for that all Places and Quarries e&s;pecially
will furni&s;h him with Evidences enough to convince any that will not be wil|fully
ignorant.</P>
<P>This effect of Petrifaction is a Symptom of old Age; for as plenty of <HI>Spiri|tuous,
Unctuous</HI> and Combu&s;tible or Inflammable Juices and Moi&s;ture is a &s;ign of
Youth: So the want of them, and of the Effects produced by them, is a &s;ign
of old Age, in which tho&s;e unctuous Juices are con&s;umed and the Spirituous
Fluids wa&s;ted, and the Parts become dry, and hard, and Stiff, and unactive;
neither fit to inkindle the active Flame or to maintain it; neither fit to make
other Sub&s;tances fluid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earth grows old and le&s;s f$u$tful.</NOTE> nor to be made fluid them&s;elves; which Fuidity is an
in&s;eparable Concomitant of that we call Spirituous Sub&s;tances: And 'tis the
plenty of tho&s;e kind of Sub&s;tances that maketh the Youthful Ages both of
Plants and Animals to flouri&s;h, and the Con&s;umption and want of them, that
makes both Plants and Animals to decay and grow old, as we call them, to
grow &s;tiff, and dry, and rough, and &s;hrivelled; all which Marks or Sy|pmtoms
may plainly be di&s;covered al&s;o in the Body of the Earth, and I am apt
to believe would be very much more if we could be truly inform'd of the for|mer
and younger Condition thereof; for I have very good Rea&s;on to believe,
that there has been times of the Earth wherein it hath had a much &s;moother
and &s;ofter, and more &s;uccous Skin than now it hath, when it more abounded
with Spirituous Sub&s;tances, when all its Powers were more &s;trong and vegete,
and when tho&s;e Scars, Roughne&s;s and Stiffne&s;s were not in being; and tho'
po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome may think all the&s;e Conceptions to be groundle&s;s and merely
Conjectural, yet I may in good time manife&s;t, that there are other ways of
coming to the di&s;covery of many Truths than what have been to this purpo&s;e
hitherto made u&s;e of, which yet are not le&s;s capable of Proof and Confirma|tion,
than Hi&s;tories or Records are by Coins, In&s;criptions or Monuments.
And tho' it may &s;eem difficult to under&s;tand or be informed of the State of
the &s;ubterraneous and inacce&s;&s;ible Regions, and of the Ages before Hi&s;tory,
yet I do not look upon either as an impo&s;&s;ibility, no, nor as in&s;uperable by
the Indu&s;try of a few, nay, of a &s;ingle Per&s;on. And po&s;&s;ibly I may &s;ome o|ther
time &s;hew divers other ways of Inquiry, and other Methods of Demon|&s;tration
of Cau&s;es than what have been yet applied to tho&s;e purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Nor is this A&s;&s;ertion of the growing old of the Earth to be looked on as &s;o
great a Paradox, or as Heterodoxical, or Sci&s;matical, for we find in Scripture
that the Kingly Prophet <HI>David</HI> in the 102 <HI>P&s;alm</HI> has an Expre&s;&s;ion that doth
plainly a&s;&s;ert it, not only of the Earth but even of the Heaven. <HI>Of old ha&s;t
thou laid the foundations of the Earth, and the Heavens are the works of t$y hands,
they &s;hall peri&s;h, but thou &s;halt indure; yea all of them &s;hall wax old like a garment,
as a ve&s;ture &s;halt thou change them, and they &s;hall be changed.</HI> Which Expre&s;&s;ion is almo&s;t verbatim repeated by the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> Chap. 51. v. 6. <HI>Lift up
your eyes to the heavens and look upon the earth beneath, for the heavens &s;hall vani&s;h
<PB N="428" REF="407">
away like Smoke, and the Earth &s;hall wax old like a Garment.</HI> Nay, this Expre&s;|&s;ion
of the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> is verbatim repeated by St. <HI>Paul</HI> in the 10. 11 and 12.
Ver&s;es of the Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> By all which it is evident at lea&s;t, that
<HI>David, I&s;aiah</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> were all of that belief. I could produce many Ex|pre&s;&s;ions
to the like purpo&s;e both in Sacred and Prophane Hi&s;tories, both of
Chri&s;tian and Heathen Writers, but tho&s;e I have quoted I &s;uppo&s;e may be
&s;ufficient to an&s;wer Objectors of that kind.</P>
<P>As for any other objections that may be brought again&s;t this Doctrine,
&s;uch as the equal Stature and Ages of Men for &s;o long time as we have had
any Hi&s;tory; from the want of Hi&s;tories of &s;uch Juvenil E&s;tates, from the
Permanency and Duration of all the Species of Plants and Animals in the
&s;ame E&s;tate, from the Incorruptibity of the Heavens and Caele&s;tial Bodies,
and &s;o of their Influences, Cau&s;ations, and many other of the like Nature; I
doubt not to be able to give a &s;atisfactory An&s;wer if any of them &s;hall be
pre&s;&s;ed or in&s;i&s;ted upon, tho' at the &s;ame time I cannot hope that all will be
convinced, much le&s;s, that all will confe&s;s them&s;elves to be &s;o, tho' really they

<P>The Aim of my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e is rather a Progre&s;&s;ion in the The|ory
of the Nature of the Air, than of any of the formerly mention'd
Effects of Earthquakes, and the rather by the way of Query and Inqui&s;iti|on,
than of po&s;&s;itive Theory and Affirmation.</P>
<P>As Fir&s;t, Whether the late Feaveri&s;h Di&s;temper that was here &s;o fre|quent,
&s;upposed by &s;ome to be inclined to Pe&s;tilential, tho' not &s;o Mortal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">of the Con&s;titution of the Air after Earthquakes.</NOTE>
might not be cau&s;ed by &s;ome Infections or Poi&s;enous Vapours ca&s;t into it by
tho&s;e late Eruptions in <HI>Italy</HI> or <HI>America?</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Whether the coldne&s;s, un&s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of the Spring, the &s;trange
Rains, Storms and Tempe&s;ts, and other &s;uch unu&s;ual Accidents, that have
lately happened in the Weather, may not have been cau&s;ed by the &s;ame Ef|ficients
that cau&s;ed the Eruptions?</P>
<P>Thirdly, Whether it may be rea&s;onable to conceive, that there could be a|ny
Communication Subterraneous between the&s;e places of tho&s;e Eruptions in
<HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Lima;</HI> or whether it were Superterraneous through the Air and
Aether?</P>
<P>Fourthly, Whether it may be rationally conceived, that Steems rai&s;ed in|to
the Body of the Air in <HI>Lima</HI> or in <HI>Naples</HI> could be continued &s;o long in it
as to be conveyed from either of tho&s;e places to <HI>England, London,</HI> &amp;c.?</P>
<P>Fifthly, How long time may be judged nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch a Conveyance?</P>
<P>Sixthly, Whether &s;uch Di&s;tempers of the Air may be precedent to the
Di&s;tempers within the Earth, and &s;o be of the Nature of a Procatarctick cau&s;e
of the Earthquakes, and if &s;o, whether those Di&s;tempers may ari&s;e from the
Nature of the Air it&s;elf, or form &s;ome external and influential Cau&s;e, ei|ther
from the Aether, Comets, or &s;ome of the more Con&s;picuous Caele&s;tial
Bodies?</P>
<P>Seventhly, Whether there may be not &s;ome general, tho' yet unknown,
Cau&s;e, that may produce both tho&s;e effects in the Earth and tho&s;e in the Air,
nay, and tho&s;e in the Aether al&s;o, &s;uch as Comets and &s;ome kinds of Meteors
al&s;o? becau&s;e of the u&s;ual Concomitance of them; as will in part appear by
&s;ub&s;equent Relations.</P>

The&s;e po&s;&s;ibly may be looked upon as not very ea&s;ily &s;olvable, and there|fore
not &s;o proper to be propounded as Queries, unle&s;s they could al&s;o be
as &s;atisfactoraly an&s;wered. I mu&s;t leave every one to Cen&s;ure as he thinks
meet, only this I mu&s;t add, that the fir&s;t &s;tep towards Knowledge is Inqui|&s;ition.</P>
<P>And that I may manife&s;t that the&s;e Queries are not altogether at random,

from who&s;e Congruities one would be apt to conjecture a &s;imilitude of Cau&s;es,
and if not a nece&s;&s;ary, yet &s;omewhat more than an accidental Concurrency
of Effects, and a kind of Periodick Revolution of them.</P>
<P>In the Year 1672, in the I&s;lands of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> that is, the I&s;lands of
<HI>Greece,</HI> this Winter was &s;o Stormy and Tempe&s;tuous, that not only the Trees
and Plantations, but the Hou&s;es al&s;o were de&s;troyed by the Lightning and
Hail; &s;o that both the Towns and Villages became almo&s;t unknowable, being
reduced to Ruins.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> al&s;o was a mo&s;t violent Hurricane, in which many of our
Nation Peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Ancona, Fauno</HI> and <HI>Rimini,</HI> there were this Year, in <HI>April,</HI> many
Hou&s;es overturned by an Earthquake; and more e&s;pecially in <HI>Romania</HI> and St.
<HI>Marc,</HI> there were above &s;ix hundred People killed, and above quaruple
that number hurt: At <HI>Rimini</HI> the Cathedral Church was overthrowed, the
Bells &s;haken out of the Tower, and may People lo&s;t their Lives.
At <HI>Fauno</HI> twenty eight Per&s;ons were killed by the fall of a Bell. The churches of the
<HI>Theatines, St. Agnie, St. Apollonce, St. Mary de la Gomia, St. Innocent, St. Ber|nard,
St. Mary della Colonolla,</HI> and all the others except only tho&s;e of the <HI>Ca|puchines,</HI>
and of <HI>Maria de Mari</HI> were endamaged. A great number of Palaces
and Hou&s;es were ruined: This happened whil&s;t People were at Church; &s;o
that above fifteen hundered were killed, and many more were hurt. At <HI>Pe|&s;aro</HI>
and <HI>Senegallo</HI> the Walls of the City and many Chimnies were thrown
down. <HI>Ancona</HI> and <HI>Rimini</HI> were abandoned by their Inhabitants, who were
con&s;trained to lie under the open Canopy of Heaven.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> the 30th., of the &s;ame Year, there was a Hurricane pa&s;&s;ed trough
all <HI>Spain,</HI> but it was mo&s;t furious about <HI>Madrid,</HI> in&s;omuch that it blew down
the Roofs, Chimnies; nay, and the Hou&s;es too; as al&s;o the Towers and
Churches; in&s;omuch that the Damage was exceeding great along the <HI>Pr$$$</HI>
and at <HI>Buon Retiro.</HI> But all this was nothing in compari&s;on of what happened the
&s;ame Day in almo&s;t all the Countries of <HI>Spain;</HI> for this furious Tempe&s;t cau&s;ed
&s;uch Ravages in <HI>Andalu&s;ia, Gallicia, Ca&s;tal, Grenada, Valencia and Bi&s;cay,</HI> as were
truly Amazing: But what was mo&s;t remarkable was this, that three Days
after the Gallions of the Plate-Fleet, which came from the <HI>We&s;t -Indies,</HI> being
arrived at the I&s;lands of <HI>Terceras,</HI> felt not the lea&s;t of it.</P>
<P>In this Year were al&s;o &s;een two Comets,&mdash;one in <HI>January</HI> another in <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>Eight Years before this, namely in 1664, were two Comets al&s;o; but all
the other Natural Hi&s;tories, or Phy&s;ical Accidents of that Year I have not
yet procured.&mdash;</P>
<P>But eight Years after this, <HI>viz</HI> 1680, which is now al&s;o eight Years &s;ince;
First, For the Comets they are yet in mo&s;t Mens Memories, and be&s;ides
there are Hi&s;tories enough extant; but next for the Earthquakes: Fir&s;t, By
a Letter from <HI>Botavia</HI> we have an account of a great Earthquake that hap|pened
in <HI>China</HI> about <HI>Peking</HI> the preceding <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> viz. That the $word$ of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI>
79, about ten in the Morning, there happened a mo&s;t terrible Earthquake,
which overturned almo&s;t all the Hou&s;es of that great City$ and the parts there-about,
where by a World of People were de&s;troyed in a mo&s;t dreadful manner, be|&s;ides
multitudes that were hurt, who&s;e number we cannot yet learn to this Hour:
Two Heads of certain Bea&s;ts, which were Carved and fixed over the Imperial
Palace Gate, were beaten off and thrown down to the Ground by the force
of the &s;hake. All the palaces of the <HI>Mandarines</HI> and their Families, and the
Courts of Ju&s;tice round the Palace were tumbled down; the Emperor com|manded
the principle <HI>Mandarines,</HI> that had command over the five parts of
<PB N="430" REF="409">
the City of <HI>Peking,</HI> to examine them&s;elves in their proper Per&s;ons, and to
give him an account of all the damages that had happened, that he might
the better advi&s;e of ways to help the Poor People that had &s;uffered. This
they did, and advi&s;ed, that if his Maje&s;ty would di&s;tribute to each two or
three Crowns of Silver at twenty five Frecks the Crown, it might be a &s;uf|ficient
&s;upply: But he thinking this was too little, commanded ten Thou|sand
Crowns to be taken out of his Trea&s;ury and di&s;tributed for the pre&s;ent
Nece&s;&s;ity. The fir&s;t, &s;econd and following Days that it la&s;ted, the Earth
was &s;haken five, &s;ix, or &s;even times a Day, but not with &s;o much violence as
by the fir&s;t; &s;o that the Inhabitants were in &s;uch Con&s;ternation as to for|&s;ake
their Hou&s;es; the Soldiers and their Wives were mo&s;t afflicted having
nothing left to &s;ub&s;i&s;t; by Day they were expo&s;ed to the Sun, and by Night
to the cold Heaven, which much incommoded them. The Emperor al&s;o was
in great Pain to know the Damages that had happened in the Neighbouring
Parts by this Earthquake, and commanded one of his great <HI>Mandarines,</HI> nam|ed
<HI>Samolio,</HI> to inquire and inform him of them, who returned this Report,
That the &frac12; 3/3 of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> whil&s;t the Heaven was covered all over with dark
Clouds, the Earthquake &s;hocked extraordinarily the City of <HI>Tongfu</HI> about a
Days Journey from <HI>Peking,</HI> that all the Imperial Magazines there had been
overturned, as likewi&s;e the old Walls of the City &s;o that of ten Parts of
the City &s;carce on remained which had not been indamaged, who&s;e pitiful
Condition was deplored by every one. The commi&s;&s;ioners of the Maga&s;ines
Emperial who had e&s;caped, render'd them&s;elves pre&s;ently to His Imperial
Maje&s;ty to give him an account of the flying of the under Officers for the
Con&s;ternation, and of their fear of the Robbing of the remaining Rice and
Provi&s;ions by Thieves, which cau&s;ed him to &s;end them &s;ixteen Hundred Sol|diers
for their Guard. The <HI>Primier Intendant</HI> of the Navy was killed by the
overturning of his Hou&s;e. The Emperor had al&s;o reported to him, how the
Robbers had wa&s;ted much of his Trea&s;ury in the Magazines that had been
overturned; and upon con&s;ideration of the general Calamity, the Em|peror
makes a mo&s;t Pious Speech to the principle <HI>Mandarines,</HI> which I &s;hall
not trouble you with, only my Author adds, What Chri&s;tian could have &s;poke
better? Will not &s;uch as he ri&s;e up in Judgment again&s;t many Chri&s;tians?
This is a &s;hort Account of what happened to two Cities of <HI>C$$$a.</HI> I &s;ay Ci|ties$
For tho' generally we have only an account of the $word$ caused to
Cities, Towns and Men, yet we are not to conceive, as if the &s;haking and
di&s;orders of an Earthquake were only aimed at Cities like Marks and Goales
to be &s;hot at; no, certainly, there may, in all &s;uch Concu&s;&s;ions and Deva&s;tati|ons
have happened much greater and different Effects from tho&s;e which come
to our knowledge; for that the mo&s;t part of the World have little concern
for what may happen in the Mountains, Hills, Plains, Forre&s;ts, Seas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
which make not any great or publick Calamity to the more con&s;iderable &s;ort
of Men; wherefore que&s;tionle&s;s, tho' many &s;trange Effects of this kind may
al&s;o have happened, and may have been &s;een and ob&s;erved by &s;ome Men, yet
they are but as it were <HI>In tran&s;itu,</HI> and quickly forgotten, &s;ince there is none
to Record them. So that many thou&s;ands of &s;uch Effects have been &s;wallow|ed
up by the Oblivion of Time, where one h$$ chanced to get by &s;ome
accidental hint to lie Recorded by chance among the heap of other Hi&s;tories.
Comets indeed, as glaring in every ones Eyes, have found, among the mul|titude
of Ob&s;ervers, &s;ome that have Recorded &s;omewhat of them to Po&s;teri|ty,
but even among them al&s;o, I doubt we &s;hall not find that one of ten has
obtained a Hi&s;tory. But this Earthquake in <HI>China</HI> was not the only Acci|dent
of this time which I would mention; for upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coroman|dal,</HI>
the Sea &s;o overflowed the Country, that infinities of Men and Cattle
were de&s;troyed, many Cities and Villages were drowned. This overflowing
was also found at <HI>Ja&s;napatnam,</HI> where it did much mi&s;chief to the Fortification, and to the Country, and the Cattle, but not &s;o much to the Men.</P>
<P>Nor were the&s;e kind of Accidents only felt in <HI>India,</HI> but the &s;ame Year there happened a con&s;iderable Earthquake in <HI>Spain,</HI> and particularly at <HI>Ma|laga.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="410">
All <HI>Spain</HI> was this Year &s;o peri&s;hed with Drouth, that not only the Pits,
Fountains and Rivers were dried, but the Harve&s;t was &s;poiled, and many
peri&s;h'd by this means: On the other &s;ide in the <HI>Autumn</HI> aro&s;e &s;uch horrible
Tempe&s;ts and Earthquakes as were felt long after. After the beginning of
<HI>September</HI> they had continual Thunder and Lightning, by which divers peri&s;h|ed.
The Hail fell &s;o on <HI>Pardo,</HI> a Plea&s;ure-hou&s;e of the Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> that
it rooted up the greate&s;t Trees, and kill'd &s;o many Bea&s;t and Foul, that not
only the Fields were almo&s;t cover'd, but the River <HI>Mancanarez;</HI> it much in|damaged
the Village <HI>Foncarral;</HI> the Old Bridge <HI>de Aranda de Duerro</HI> was born
down by the Waters of the River <HI>Tagus,</HI> which run under, and did much da|mage

Trees, Bridges, and
Hou&s;es: The like Ruins were cau&s;ed almo&s;t over all the Kingdom, in&s;omuch
that in one Village, only, forty People were lo&s;t. The greate&s;t violence was$
at <HI>Madrid</HI> the twenty &s;ixth of <HI>September,</HI> where the Water overflowed &s;o as
to mount into the Garden of the <HI>Augu&s;tines</HI> and throw down the Wall; al&s;o
into the fair Parterres of the Counte&s;s <HI>Ognate,</HI> and run into her Hou&s;e, ruin'd
the rich Furniture of Pictures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the lower Story; ruin'd the Stables
and razed one Hou&s;e. The River al&s;o bore away fifty Foot of a &s;trong Stone-Wall
made to &s;top the Pa&s;&s;age into the River <HI>Prado:</HI> This River one of the
lea&s;t in <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;o &s;welled as to carry away almo&s;t all before it, as four Iron
Gates, and the Cro&s;s of the <HI>Via Sacra.</HI> It beat down the Bridge before <HI>Bu|on
Retiro,</HI> and broke through the middle of the Stone Bank. It ru&s;h'd into
the Gardens of <HI>No&s;tre Dame de Arocha</HI> after it had beat down the Wall; it
run into the general Ho&s;pital carrying with it an Arch of Stones. The twen|ty
&s;eventh the overflowing continued with con&s;tant Thunder and Lightning,
when the River <HI>Mancanarez</HI> bore down the fair Bridge of <HI>Toledo</HI> of &s;ixty Ar|ches.
The twenty eighth the Streams of <HI>Prado</HI> &s;o &s;welled by the Torrents

Peopled, had, the ninth of this Month, &s;uch violent Shocks of an Earth|quake,
that all were frighted, the Sea was &s;o di&s;turbed, that the Fi&s;h leaped
out of the Water, and the Ships in the Harbour were ca&s;t above twenty Foot
from their places, which the Mariners believed to be &s;unk; the Harbours

to be Habitable. Divers Churches and Palaces Felt the effects al&s;o; five
Cloy&s;ters of Religious with the People were utterly ruined, and above all,
that of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> where Stone was not left on Stone, where fourteen Per|&s;ons
Peri&s;h'd, four Ho&s;pitals, one Colledge, the Bi&s;hops Palace, the Palaces
of <HI>A Diego de Argote, de Jo. de Torrez, de Diego de Cordua,</HI> and a fair Hou&s;e
joining to the Cathedral was thrown down, yet the Church which had been
Repai$ing and Beautifying ever &s;ince 1521 &s;caped, tho' divers times &s;haken.
In the Suburbs <HI>Los Perchelez</HI> two hundred and twenty five Hou&s;es were thrown
down, &s;o that in all 1282 Hou&s;es were de&s;troy'd. Many Hou&s;es in the
Confines of <HI>Malaga</HI> were overturned; be&s;ides the Earth opened in divers
places and di&s;gorged Waters in great abundance, which &s;welled the Rivers
and made them overflow. Many Hou&s;es in the Villages were de&s;troyed, as
at <HI>Pizaria</HI> four Miles from <HI>Malaga,</HI> fifteen of twenty four Hou&s;es were
overturned; &s;ome Mountains were di&s;placed, and divers Per&s;ons and Cattle
lo&s;t: The Wall of <HI>Alhaurin de la tor$e,</HI> two Miles from <HI>Malaga,</HI> opened four
Foot, but clo&s;ed again: The Ja&s;per Columns of the Church were lifted up
and &s;etled down again on their Pede&s;tals. At <HI>Competa,</HI> &s;ix Leagues from the
City, nothing but the Tabernacle and the Cro&s;s of the Church remained
whole. At <HI>Aloizana</HI> forty Hou&s;es were tumbled down, as many at <HI>Cartama,</HI>
and thereabout al&s;o at <HI>Coin,</HI> and a great number of People peri&s;h'd.
At great <HI>Alhaurin</HI> two hundred and forty Hou&s;es and the Church were de&s;troy'd,
of which only fifty three were &s;omewhat Habitable. In the City of <HI>Minorz</HI>
five Leagues from <HI>Malaga,</HI> thirty &s;even Hou&s;es were tumbl'd down, and fif|teen
<PB N="432" REF="411">
Per&s;ons cru&s;h'd. The Church at the City <HI>Binal-Madera</HI> fell on a heap,
and all the Hou&s;es render'd unhabitable. The Earth opened at <HI>Veles Malaga,</HI>
and &s;o &s;welled a River, which run &s;ome &s;pace from thence, that it ro&s;e ten
Pikes above the tops of the Hou&s;es, which it &s;qua&s;h'd in running. Many
Hou&s;es were ruin'd at <HI>Alorb,</HI> others much endamag'd, with the Cloi&s;ter of
St. <HI>Francis.</HI> All the churches of <HI>Granada</HI> were &s;haken, and a Chappel in the
Church of <HI>Mercy</HI> ruin'd: All which were &s;ad Spectacles.</P>
<P>I have given the Particulars of the whole Relation, mo&s;t of which concern
Buildings, Men and Cattle, tho&s;e being the Particulars mo&s;t People are af|fected
with and &s;o ob&s;erve, and you find only two hints, as it were, of o|ther
Effects, the one is of the removing &s;everal Mountains, the other of the
Earths opening and di&s;gorging a Flood. But 'tis not to be thought but that
an inqui&s;itive Naturali&s;t might have found ten times more remarkable. Ef|fects
in the Country than the &s;haking down a few Hou&s;es in the Towns and
Villages, all which, if taken notice of, are &s;oon forgot and lo&s;t, and &s;o have
been in former Ages, and therefore no wonder if we hear nothing of them in
Books: But Nature it&s;elf has pre&s;erved &s;omewhat of the memory of them
by the Medals or indelible Characters of Shells or other Petrify'd, or other-wi&s;e
pre&s;erved Sub&s;tances, which any, that have Sen&s;es and Under&s;tanding,
may read. But this is not the aim of my pre&s;ent relating the&s;e Hi&s;tories,
but to give an example of a Contemporarine&s;s of Earthquakes at great di|&s;tances
upon the Earth, and a &s;imilitude of Effects with tho&s;e we have this
Year heard of from <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>America;</HI> nay, and let me add what we
have had in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>England, viz</HI> a kind of Aguei&s;h Di&s;temper, yet not Pe|&s;tilential,
which, 'tis well known, has been very general; for I find that in
<HI>October</HI> Agues were as frequent this Year in <HI>France,</HI> as the late Cold or Di|&s;temper
was here: It was then that Dr. <HI>Tabour</HI> cured the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI>
and many other Per&s;ons of great Quality, among the re&s;t the <HI>Dauphine&s;s</HI> fir&s;t,
and afterwards the <HI>Dauphin</HI> him&s;elf, by a Medicine he had invented; tho'
<HI>Tabours</HI> demanding five Thou&s;and Crowns for di&s;covering his Receipt, made
the <HI>Dauphin</HI> fir&s;t make u&s;e of other means, but without effect. (I will not
like an A&s;trologer name to you the Occurrences that then happened at <HI>Cologne,</HI>
nor make compari&s;on with the pre&s;ent, but leave tho&s;e to the A&s;trologians,
<HI>&amp;c</HI>). The Plague al&s;o this Year 1689, was very much at <HI>Prague,</HI> &s;o that &s;ome
judged there died in that City thirty Thou&s;and$ at <HI>Dre&s;den</HI> above four Thou|&s;and,
at <HI>Leip&s;ick</HI> about three Thousand; I cannot &s;ay there hath ben a Comet
this Year, but I have been confidently told, that there appear'd one in the
Mornings about a Month &s;ince, but I could not have the luck to &s;ee it, tho'
I looked for it divers Mornings after I heard of it, but 'tis more likely it may
appear in <HI>October,</HI> or later; but that belongs to another Head, the Affected
Earth and Infected Air being tho&s;e I de&s;igned at pre&s;ent to compare; and in
the&s;e we find the effects in <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Coromandel</HI> eight Years &s;ince to an&s;wer
those of <HI>America</HI> this pre&s;ent Year, and that then of <HI>Spain</HI> to this now of <HI>Ita|ly;</HI>
and tho&s;e then of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> to the late here in <HI>England,</HI> tho' in
all particulars tho&s;e of the Year eighty &s;eem to exceed tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent
Year. But as the Relations of that are but &s;hort and imperfect, &s;o are tho&s;e
of the pre&s;ent as yet much more; but 'twere to be wi&s;h'd &s;ome more full
might be obtained and Recorded before they be forgotten, which a little
&s;pace of time will otherwi&s;e effect, and 'tis not to be doubted but we might
hear of much &s;tranger effects of the <HI>Lima</HI> Earthquake, than yet have arrived,
if care were taken to procure a fuller account of them. And by the Ye&s;ter|days
<HI>Bru&s;&s;ells</HI> we are informed of a Cleft in a Mountain belonging to the
<HI>Marquis de Tarracu&s;a,</HI> of four Spans broad and two Miles long, of which
they can find no bottom, and of a Fire &s;hot into the Heavens like a great
Beam, of which they lo&s;t the fight, not knowing whether it went.</P>
<P>But in the mean time po&s;&s;ibly it may not &s;eem altogether unrea&s;onable to &s;uppose, that &s;uch an Eruption may emit poi&s;enous Vapours, as well as &s;ometimes poi&s;enous Waters; as appears by that of <HI>France</HI> which I have Printed in one of my Collections. Nor may it &s;eem &s;o &s;trange to &s;uppo&s;e its effect may operate at &s;uch di&s;tances, and not at the very place; when we con&s;ider how fiery and volatile &s;uch Steams may be, how violently &s;hot into the Air,
<PB N="433" REF="412">
and blow far off the Du&s;t and A&s;hes of Hecla, <HI>Aetna,</HI> the <HI>Palma,</HI> and many
others have been carried in the Air before they have fallen, of which In&s;tances
may be produced. And that, in probability, the le&s;s active or dead Earthy-Materials
are tho&s;e, which fall near the, place, who&s;e Qualifications may be of
differing Natures. Nor will any very long time be thought requi&s;ite for their
tran&s;port to far di&s;tant Countries imbody'd in the Air, when I have proved
the velocities of its motions. Nor will it &s;eem &s;trange to one that &s;hall well
con&s;ider the known Effects of the &s;everal Winds, to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch kind of tran&s;|ports:
But of the&s;e Particulars I &s;hall &s;ay more upon &s;ome other occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>This Lecture was read <HI>May</HI> the <HI>29th.</HI> 1689, and An&s;wers two Objections a|gain&s;t the Athor's Theory of Earthquakes, particularly as to Petrifactions.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>I Delivered in my la&s;t Lecture in this place, the Methods I had made u&s;e
of for the founding and e&s;tabli&s;hing the Doctrines or Conclu&s;ions I had
made concerning the Cau&s;es and Rea&s;ons of the pre&s;ent State and Phaenomena
of the Surface of the Earth, which was by a methodical Induction from the Phaeno|mena
them&s;elves of the mo&s;t remote, as well as the more approximate and im|mediate
Cau&s;es thereof. But notwith&s;tanding all the Arguments I have al|ledged,
and the Proofs I have produced in the delivery of this <HI>Theory,</HI> I &s;till
find that there remain upon the Minds of &s;ome &s;uch Doubts and contrary
Per&s;uasions, that they cannot for&s;ake their former Opinions; and therefore
(tho' I think I have already fully proved every part, &s;o that the Confutations
of &s;uch Objections would be but the nece&s;&s;ary Corollaries from the &s;aid Do|ctrine,
yet since I find they are &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on as material Objections that
will need a more particular Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and Examination) I thought it not im|pertinent
to examine them more &s;trictly, to find the Power and Efficacy, or to
di&s;cover the Weakne&s;s and In&s;ufficiency of them for the purpo&s;e they are de|&s;igned.
That thereby the <HI>Idola</HI> (as my Lord <HI>Verulam</HI> &s;ays) which pre-po&s;&s;e&s;s
the Minds of &s;ome Men, and mole&s;t: them in the di&s;covery and imbracing
of Sciences may be detected, and, as much as may be, removed and di&s;lolved,
thereby to leave the Mind more free to Di&s;cour&s;e and Rea&s;on aright, with|out
the prejudices of any unfound, unaccountable and unwarrantable Do|ctrines
formerly imbrac'd.</P>
<P>The Objections I &s;hall at pre&s;ent examine are only two, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That if the&s;e large Petrified Bodies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Obj. 1&s;t. As to a Species being lo&s;t</NOTE> &s;uch as the <HI>Ophiomorphite</HI> Stone
which I did formerly &s;hew to this Society in the place, be &s;uppo&s;ed to have
been the Production of this Shell of a certain kind of <HI>Nautilus</HI> of that big|ne&s;s
and &s;hape, which, in preceding Ages of the World, had been produced
and perfected to that Magnitude in the bottom of the Sea, which then was
near the place where they are now found, as I have argued for; then it will
nece&s;&s;arily follow, &s;ay they, that there have been; in former times, certain
Species of Animals in Nature, which in &s;ucceeding and in the pre&s;ent Age
have been and are wholly lo&s;t; for neither have we in Authors any mention
made of &s;uch Creatures, nor are there any &s;uch found at pre&s;ent, either
near the places of their po&s;ition (as on the Shores or Sea about this I&s;land)
nor in any other part of the World for ought we yet know. Now, to &s;uppo&s;e
&s;uch a Doctrine as doth nece&s;&s;arily infer &s;uch a Con&s;equence, is looked upon by
&s;uch as ab&s;urd and extravagant; for that it would argue an imperfection of
the fir&s;t Creation, which &s;hould produce any one Species more than what was
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to its pre&s;ent and future State, and &s;o would be a great
derogation from the Wi&s;dom and Power of the Omnipotent Creator.</P>
<P>To this fir&s;t Objection I An&s;wer, Fir&s;t, That tho' it may po&s;&s;ibly be true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t. An&s;wer.</NOTE> that there is at pre&s;ent no &s;uch <HI>Nautili</HI> to be found upon the Coa&s;t or Shores
<PB N="434" REF="413">
of the Lands where the&s;e forts of figured Stones are found, yet no one is a&s;|&s;ured
that there are not &s;ome of the &s;ame Species, and as big in &s;ome other
parts of the World, as po&s;&s;ibly at the bottoms of &s;ome of the great Oceans.
Of &s;uch Productions and tho&s;e Multifarious both Vegetable and Animal, no
one can doubt that has found in &s;oundable Depths &s;uch variety of te&s;taceous
and cru&s;taceous Animals there re&s;iding, as in their proper and Natural Regi|ons;
which would by no means po&s;&s;ibly be produced or kept alive in parts of
the Sea where they &s;hould want their natural Accommodations; one of which
may po&s;&s;ibly be a &s;ufficient degree of Pre&s;&s;ure from the incumbent Column of
Water, which, if &s;uch be nece&s;&s;ary to their Life and well Being, we are
no more to wonder that they &s;hould not be found in &s;hallower Waters, than
that Men &s;hould not be found inhabiting the tops of the <HI>Andes,</HI> of the <HI>Atlas, Alps,</HI>
or <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> which from the thinne&s;s and coldne&s;s of the Air at tho&s;e heights,
are no ways fit for Re&s;piration and &s;u&s;taining Life. Now, that the pre&s;ent
Land of <HI>England</HI> may have in former Ages had &s;ome &s;uch Po&s;ition with re&s;pect to
an incumbent Sea, I could produce &s;everal Arguments were they now mate|rial
to the an&s;wering the pre&s;ent Objection, but I will not now in&s;i&s;t upon it.</P>
<P>But in the &s;econd place I an&s;wer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d. <HI>An&s;wer.</HI></NOTE> That tho' po&s;&s;ibly there may be no &s;uch
<HI>Nautilus</HI> to be found de&s;cribed in any Natural Hi&s;torian at this Day, yet 'tis
po&s;&s;ible there may be many of the &s;ame Species, and of as great Magnitudes
in divers parts of the World, &s;uch as have been either not yet di&s;covered by
the <HI>Europeans</HI> or but of late, or but little frequented; and &s;o tho' they may
be there frequent and plentiful enough, yet none may have been brought
thence into <HI>Europe</HI> as yet, or po&s;&s;ibly &s;o much as &s;een there; 'tis not to be
doubted that there really are great multitudes of differing Species of Vege|tables,
In&s;ects, Bea&s;ts and Fi&s;hes yet in places le&s;s frequented, of which we
in <HI>Europe</HI> have hitherto had no knowledge or information; and tho' many
&s;trange things have been of late Years brought to our view, yet we may with
Rea&s;on enough a&s;&s;ert, there are many more yet latent, which Time may make
manife&s;t: For if we con&s;ider the &s;mall knowledge of things of this Nature
that we yet have acquired, of places remote, even the mo&s;t frequented, we
need not much wonder at the le&s;&s;er information of &s;uch, a$$ are not known or
le&s;s frequented; for not to in&s;i&s;t upon the multitude$ of Vegetables that have
been newly &s;hewn to us by the Authors of the <HI>Hort$word$ Malabaricus,</HI> and by
<HI>Brennius,</HI> and others, we are put in hope, to &s;ee the De&s;criptions of as many
more yet by the &s;ame Authors, from the &s;ame places which yet are but two
&s;mall &s;pots in re&s;pect of the va&s;t Spaces, and variety of Soils and Climates
yet un&s;urvey'd; and 'tis not to be doubted but that the Earth, and Air, and
much more yet, the Seas or &s;everal Countries and Climates would afford as
great varieties of Birds, Bea&s;ts, In&s;ects and Fi&s;hes, if there were found know|ing
and diligent &s;earchers and de&s;cribers of them: And that this is &s;o, I &s;hall
mention only one In&s;tance, becau&s;e 'tis pertinent to the pre&s;ent Subject, name|ly,
that I have had a peculiar kind of <HI>Nautilus</HI> brought from the <HI>Caribys,</HI>
where they are in great plenty, and yet I do not find any Author has taken
notice of them, nor could I ever meet with more than one Man that had ta|ken
notice or knew any thing of them, tho' the I&s;land has been long inhabit|ed
and planted by the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> which Shell I have formerly &s;hewn to this So|ciety,
who were &s;atisfy'd by the Characteri&s;tick that it is a Species of the
<HI>Nautili.</HI></P>
<P>And as we yet want a <HI>Hortus Sinen&s;is, Japonen&s;is, Tartaricus, Canaden&s;is Vir|ginianus,
Bra&s;ilianus, Peruvianus, Americanus,</HI> &amp;c. &s;o we want the Natural Hi|&s;tories
of the Animals of mo&s;t kinds, of tho&s;e places, and even of the Fi&s;hes
which are frequently enough met with by Navigators, tho' not further taken
notice of than as they may be u&s;eful for their pre&s;ent Food, or the like. We
are therefore two ha&s;ty in our Computations and &s;umming up all we have,
and concluding that mu&s;t be the &s;umme of all that can be had; for that there
are yet many particulars behind, that mu&s;t come into the &s;ame account before
the inclo&s;ure be fully made and the Books be &s;hut, if at lea&s;t a full Account
be expected. We are informed by Mr.&mdash;<HI>Cole,</HI> and divers other late, inqui|&s;itive
Men, how many new things have been di&s;cover'd here at home, where
<PB N="435" REF="414">
yet there have not formerly been wanting inqui&s;itive Men; what then may
we not expect from other places where none &s;uch have ever come, at lea&s;t,
that we know of?</P>
<P>Again, how apt &s;hould we have been, if there had been found a Petrify'd
<HI>Stella arbore&s;ceus Rondeletii,</HI> before we had been certify'd of the exi&s;tence of
&s;uch a &s;trange &s;haped Fi&s;h of the Species of the <HI>Stellae,</HI> to have concluded
there had never been &s;uch a Fi&s;h, becau&s;e it differs &s;o very much from the
Star-fi&s;hes or five Fingers, as they term them, commonly taken on our Coa&s;ts?
The like may be infer'd concerning the &s;trange variety I have &s;een of the <HI>E|chini</HI>
brought from &s;everal parts; for they differ much more from one another
than the Helmet Stones, which I have hitherto &s;een, do from &s;everal &s;orts
of them: The like may be &s;aid of the varieties of Sharks Teeth, as to one
another, and as to the <HI>Glo&s;&s;opetrae</HI> found upon the Land.</P>
<P>So that upon the whole we may conclude, that it does not nece&s;&s;arily fol|low,
that tho&s;e <HI>Species</HI> of <HI>Nautili,</HI> mu&s;t be now wholly lo&s;t that produced
the moulding Shells of the&s;e <HI>Ophiomorphite</HI> Stones, we find here in <HI>England,</HI>
becau&s;e they are not now found upon our Shores, nor becau&s;e we cannot now
certainly affirm where they are to be found, and therefore that the induction
or inference is made from too few Particulars, and may, nay, ought to be ex|amined
a-new, when we can procure a more full Account of the Productions
of the Shores and Oceans, which Time and Indu&s;try may po&s;&s;ibly effect.</P>
<P>But not further to in&s;i&s;t upon this way of Defence, we will, for the pre|&s;ent,
take this Suppo&s;ition to be real and true, that there have been in for|mer
times of the Word, divers <HI>Species</HI> of Creatures, that are now quite lo&s;t,
and no more of them &s;urviviug upon any part of the Earth. Again, That
there are now divers <HI>Species</HI> of Creatures which never exceed at pre&s;ent a cer|tain
Magnitude, which yet, in former Ages of the World, were u&s;ually of
a'much greater and Gygantick Standard; &s;uppo&s;e ten times as big as at pre|&s;ent;
we will grant al&s;o a &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;everal <HI>Species</HI> may really not have
been created of the very Shapes they now are of, but that they have changed
in great part their Shape, as well as dwindled and degenerated into a dwar|fi&s;h
Progeny; that this may have been &s;o con&s;iderable, as that if we could
have &s;een both together, we &s;hould not have judged them of the &s;ame Species.
We will further grant there may have been, by mixture of Creatures, pro|duced
a &s;ort differing in Shape, both from the Created Forms of the one and
other Compounders, and from the true Created Shapes of both of them.
And yet I do not &s;ee how this doth in the lea&s;t derogate from the Power, Wi&s;|dom
and Providence of God, as is alledged, or that it doth any ways con|tradict
any part of the Scripture, or any Conclu&s;ion of the mo&s;t eminent
Philo&s;ophers, or any rational Argument that may be drawn from the Phaeno|mena
of Nature; nay, I think the quite contrary Inferences may, nay, mu&s;t,
and ought to be made.</P>
<P>For fir&s;t we do find that all individuals are made of &s;uch a Con&s;titution, as
that beginning from an Atom, as it were, they are for a certain period of
Time increa&s;ing and growing, and from thence begin to decay, and at la&s;t
Die and Corrupt. And in every part of their Life they are in a continual
change or progre&s;s, from more perfect to more imperfect, there being a continual
growth or Death and Decay to the final Di&s;&s;olution; yet this is not Argu|ment
again&s;t the Omnipotence, Providence and Wi&s;dom of the Creator, who
thought fit &s;o to Create them. Again, we find that the Powers and Facul|ties
of the animated Bodies do continually exert a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of differing Ef|fects,
and continually change the Figures and Shapes from one degree to an|other.
As we &s;ee that there are many changings both within and without
the Body, and every &s;tate produces a new appearance, why then may there
not be the &s;ame progre&s;&s;ion of the Species from its fir&s;t Creation to its final
termination? Or why &s;hould the &s;uppo&s;ition of this be any more a derogation
to the Perfection of the Creator, than the other; be&s;ides, we find nothing
in Holy Writ that &s;eems to argue &s;uch a con&s;tancy of Nature; but on the
contrary many Expre&s;&s;ions that denote a continual decay, and a tendency to
a final Di&s;&s;olution; and this not only of Terre&s;tial Beings&punc; but of Cele&s;tial,
even of the Sun, Moon and Stars and of the Heavens them&s;elves. Nor have
<PB N="436" REF="415">
I hitherto met with any Doctrine among the Philo&s;ophers, that is repugnant
to this Doctrine, but many that agree with it, and &s;uppo&s;e the like States
to happen to all Cele&s;tial Bodies, that is, to the Stars and Planets that
happen to the Individuals of any Species; and con&s;equently if the Body of
the Earth be accounted one of the number of the Plantes, then that al&s;o is
&s;ubject to &s;uch Changes and final Di&s;&s;olution, and then at lea&s;t it mu&s;t be
granted, that all the Species will be lost; and therefore, why not &s;ome at one
time and &s;ome at another? This Objection therefore, I conceive, is of little
validity again&s;t the Doctrine I have delivered, and therefore I &s;hall proceed
to the &s;econd Objection, and examine the Validity thereof.</P>
<P>It is Objected then in the Second place, That &s;ince it is manife&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d. <HI>obj.</HI> As to figured Spars and Chry&s;tals.</NOTE> that
there are many curiou&s;ly figured Bodies found in the Earth, which cannot be
imagin'd to be produc'd by the Cau&s;es and Means that I have alledg'd as the
Shapes of Salts, Sparrs, Ores, Chry&s;tals, and divers other kinds of regular
mineral Bodies, al&s;o, Agates Mochu&s;es, curiou&s;ly &s;peckled Marbles, and the
like. Now, &s;ince it mu&s;t be granted, that they are made by a Pla&s;tick Facul|ty,
why may not that Faculty extend al&s;o &s;o far as to be the cau&s;e of tho&s;e
other Figured Stones, which re&s;emble Shells or other Animal or Vegetable
Sub&s;tances?</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer, That tho' it be manife&s;t,. that Salts, Chry&s;tals, Sparrs.
&amp;c. do plainly receive their regular Figures from the Texture or Naturae of
their own Parts, as is evident, mo&s;t e&s;pecially in the Chry&s;tallization of Salts,
and the Petrifactions of the like Figur'd Sub&s;tances, yet the Figures, and
painted and &s;tained Shapes, as it were of <HI>Agates, Mochus's</HI> and the like, are
not to be a&s;cribed to the De&s;igns of Nature, but to the Productions of
Chance; for in&s;tance, the Pictures that in <HI>Mochus's</HI> &s;eem to repre&s;ent Trees,
Hills, Hou&s;es, and other per&s;pective Repre&s;entations, they are no otherwi&s;e
cau&s;ed than by &s;ome Clefts, or Flaws in the &s;aid Stones, into which &s;ome
colour'd juices have in&s;inuated them&s;elves, and by that means formed tho&s;e
Repre&s;entations which appear in the Body of the Stone, and that this is &s;o,
and may be Artificially produc'd by &s;everal Bodies and Liquors, which have
no affinity, either with <HI>Agate, Mochus,</HI> or Marble, I can make it plainly ap|pear
by Experiment, which, if it be thought fit, I &s;hall produce either now,
or the next Meeting.</P>
<P>THe Experiment here mention'd, was by taking two flat Marbles or Gla&s;s-plates,
and laying upon one of them &s;everal drops of a dark Oil-colour, &s;uch as Pain|ters
u&s;e, and pre&s;&s;ing the other flat Stone or Gla&s;s upon it, by that compre&s;&s;ure &s;eve|ral
curious Repre&s;entations, like the branchings of Vegetables, and the like, were ex|hibited;
which explain'd the Repre&s;entations in <HI>Agates,</HI> &amp;c. a different colour'd mi|neral
Juice in&s;inuating it&s;elf into the Clefts or Inter&s;tices of the Stone, and a&s;terwards
petrify'd to an equal hardne&s;s with the re&s;t of the Stone; tho' many times there is a
different hardne&s;s in the Veins, or Repre&s;entations from the other parts of the Stone,
as is &s;een in Marbles and other $$$$ed Stone.</P>

Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> of the Skeleton of an Elephant found buried in <HI>Germany,</HI> at
the Foot of a Hill or Mountain at fourteen Foot deep, and cover'd with
&s;everal Layers of Earth, but buried in a Sand, which the whole adjacent
Mountain is found to con&s;i&s;t of, being at a place call'd <HI>Tonna</HI> near <HI>Erfond</HI> in
<HI>Germany.</HI> [I take notice of the&s;e Particulars, becau&s;e they may be found to
give &s;ome light as to the explication of an other Phaenomenon which I &s;hall
by and by relate.] Now, tho' <HI>Tentzelius</HI> really judged and pronounced it
to be the Skeleton of an Elephant, yet it was not without the Contradiction of
many others of divers differing Opinions; the greate&s;t number of which were
for a&s;&s;erting it to be <HI>a Lu&s;us Nature,</HI> as it &s;eems the whole Colledge of <HI>Gottha,</HI>
and divers other Learned Profe&s;&s;ors; but their Arguments are prov'd in&s;ig|nificant,
and his own Doctrine &s;ufficiently E&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Epi&s;tles which
he wrote to Snr. <HI>Magliabechi</HI> and Publi&s;h'd in Print, and this Honourable So|ciety
<PB N="437" REF="416" MS="Y">
were yet farther convinc'd of the certainty of it, by the Fragments and Spe|cimens
of the trials he had made of &s;everal of tho&s;e Bones: But, after all, great Dif|ficulties
aro&s;e concerning the Means and Cau&s;e of the burying of itat &s;uch a
place, and at &s;uch a depth and the covering of it, to be the natural Layer of the
Earth, and not the Artificial, filling up of a Grave or Pit dug by Art to bury
it; Some attributed it to the effect of <HI>Noah's</HI> Flood, as 'tis u&s;ual for mo&s;t to do
in the like Ca&s;es, where they can think of no other Cau&s;e; to me, I confe&s;s,
it &s;eem'd rather to be the effect of &s;ome preceding Earthquakes, as I formerly
here deliver'd in a Di&s;cour&s;e on that Subject, when I fir&s;t met with a Relation
of it, as I have in other Di&s;cour&s;es al&s;o about <HI>Lignum Fo&s;&s;ile</HI> or Subterrane|ou$
Trees, and other Sub&s;tances found buried, and now dug out from under
the Ground, not only in <HI>Italy, Germany</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> &amp;c. but even in <HI>England,
Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI> Now, becau&s;e by our forreign Gazets, and al&s;o by our
own from them of a late Phaenomenon in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> we have the Hi&s;tory of
a late Earthquake that happened there this pre&s;ent Year, who&s;e effects do
give an evident Proof of the Doctrine which I &s;uppo&s;ed, and indeavour'd to
maintain, I thought it would not be improper to mention it here, and to
add it as a further addition to the Hi&s;tory of Nature. I &s;hall indeavour to
get the full Account of it Printed at <HI>Batavia</HI> in <HI>Java,</HI> an Ab&s;tract of which
was Printed in the <HI>Harlem</HI> Currant in <HI>October</HI> la&s;t, and an Epitomy of that
in our Weekly News-papers, which was this. Tran&s;crib'd out of the <HI>Lon|don</HI>

<P><HI>&startq;Am&s;terdam October</HI> 2. Our Letters from <HI>Batavia</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies</HI> of the
8th of <HI>February,</HI> &s;ay, That on the fifth of <HI>January,</HI> about two in the Morn|ing,
a mo&s;t terrible Earthquake happen'd, which was &s;o violent, that one
and twenty Brick Hou&s;es, and twenty others were overturn'd, &s;o that if it
had la&s;ted a little longer they mu&s;t have been all thrown down. About 40
or 50 Per&s;ons were Buried alive under the Ruins of the Hou&s;es that fell, and
near the &s;ame number were Lamed. Some &s;mall time before the Earth|quake,
the Blew Mountain, otherwi&s;e call'd Mount <HI>Sales,</HI> bur&s;t, with &s;uch
a terrible Flame and Noi&s;e, that it was both &s;een and heard there, tho' &s;ix
Days Journey di&s;tant. Next Morning the River which falls into the Sea
here, and has its Ri&s;e from that Mountain, became very high and Muddy,
and brought down abundance of Bu&s;hes and Trees half Burnt; and the
Pa&s;&s;age being &s;topt, the Water overflow'd the Country round, all the
Gardens about the Town, and &s;ome of our Streets; &s;o that the Fi&s;hes lay
Dead in them: It was a whole Month before the River could be clear'd,
altho' 3000 <HI>Indians</HI> were daily imploy'd to clear the &s;ame, during which
time we were oblig'd to fetch fre&s;h Water from <HI>Bantam,</HI> which is forty Miles.
All the Fi&s;h in the River, except the Carps, were kill'd by the Mud and dirty
Water: A great number of drown'd Buffaloes, Tigers, Rhinocero's, Deer,
Apes, and other Wild Bea&s;ts, were brought down by the Current; and
notwith&s;tanding a Crocadile is Amphibious, &s;everal of them were found
Dead among the re&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>The Phaenomena of this Earthquake, tho' they afford a probable &s;oluti|on
of the more common Phaenomena of fo&s;&s;ile Trees, Wood, Nutts, Leaves,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Vegetables, and of the fo&s;&s;ile parts of Animals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;uch as Teeth,
Hornes, Bones; yet there are &s;ome other &s;trange Phaenomena, which I con|jecture
to have been effected by the &s;ame efficient Cau&s;e. If it be inquir'd
what tho&s;e &s;trange Phaenomena are, that I may give you an In&s;tance, I &s;hall
acquaint you with one I late met with and receiv'd from a curious Per&s;on, who
made the Ob&s;ervations him&s;elf, of which I have &s;ince been confirm'd by an|other
curious Per&s;on who had &s;een and ob&s;erv'd all the &s;ame Particulars. The
Relation, in &s;hort, is this.</P>

<HEAD>A Description of the Ridge of Mary Burrow in the Queens County in
Ireland.</HEAD>
<P>&startq;This Ridge runs North and South, from <HI>Tymohoe</HI> to <HI>Mary-burrow,</HI> about
&s;even Miles, from thence towards <HI>Montmelick,</HI> four Miles further, and as
this Author was inform'd through the King's County of <HI>We&s;tmeath,</HI> towards
<PB N="438" REF="417" MS="Y">
<HI>Athlone,</HI> but in the&s;e la&s;t mention'd Countries is much lower than in the
Queens County.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;From the &s;aid <HI>Tymohoe</HI> to <HI>Montmelick,</HI> being both in the Queens County,
it is about fourteen or fifteen Foot high, where highe&s;t, as near as this Au|thor
can conjecture, being laid as irregular as the Sands are usually laid by
the Waves on the Sea-&s;hoar, with &s;everal bendings in and out, high
and low; the Sides &s;o &s;teep, that in mo&s;t places not ea&s;y to ride up, and in
many places Trees growing on the Sides, and a little thin Skin of Gra&s;s,
apt to be burnt or &s;corch'd with the lea&s;t dry Weather.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is &s;o broad on the top as to afford room enough for four Hor&s;e-men to
ride a Brea&s;t, the Road, in many places, lying on the top thereof.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is compos'd altogether of &s;mall rough Pebble grayi&s;h Stones about the
bigne&s;s of a Mans Fi&s;t; and other &s;maller ones mix'd with Sand or Gravel,
but no mixture of Clay or Loam, as this Author ever ob&s;erv'd, which &s;everal
times he &s;ought after as he travell'd that way.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;None of the Lands adjacent to this Ridge have any of the materials where|of
it is compos'd, mix'd with their Soils; in mo&s;t places there are Boggs to
within a very few Yards of its Foot, and where any Arrable lies near it, there
is no mixture of the above Pebble or Sand therewith.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;So that it &s;hould &s;eem probable that this Ridge of Pebble and Sand was
brought from &s;ome remote places by &s;ome violent motion of Waters, and
di&s;pos'd into the form it now remains in, which induc'd the Author &s;e|veral
times to &s;ay, he believ'd it to be the effects of <HI>Noah's</HI> Flood, the Con|&s;ideration
whereof he refers to better Judgments.&endq;</P>

<P><HI>MAY</HI> 26. 1697. We have lately had &s;everal Accounts of Animal Sub|&s;tances
of various kinds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Animal sub&s;tances found buried.</NOTE> that have been found buried in the &s;uperficial
Parts of the Earth, that is not very far below the pre&s;ent Surface; as par|ticularly
the parts of the Head of an <HI>Hippopotamus</HI> at <HI>Chartham</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> that of
the Bones <HI>Mammatoroyko&s;t,</HI> or of a &s;trange Subterraneous Animal, as the
<HI>Siberians</HI> fancy, which is commonly dug up in <HI>Siberia,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Ludolphus</HI> judges
to be the Teeth and Bones of Elephants; and indeed that peice which I &s;aw of it
was much like Ivory in its Texture, only the out &s;ide of it &s;eem'd to have
been cover'd by a kind of Skin, which I never heard of or &s;aw any Elephants
Tooth &s;o cover'd with; then the Bones and Teeth of a large Elephant lately
dug up in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> of which I &s;ome while &s;ince tran&s;crib'd the Relation out
of one of the late Monthly Mercuries, and read it at one of the Meetings of
<PB N="439" REF="418" MS="Y">
this Society; al&s;o the great Bone in the Repo&s;itory pre&s;ented to the Society by
Sir <HI>Tho' Brown,</HI> which was found upon the foundering or calying of &s;ome Cliff in
<HI>Norfolk,</HI> which &s;eems to have been the Leg-bone of &s;ome Elephant, if it be not
&s;ome Bone of the fore Fin of &s;ome Whale; 'tis equally admirable which &s;oever
it may be found to be by one skill'd in the Ofteology of tho&s;e Creatures; and
la&s;tly the great Hornes that have been often found and dug up in <HI>Ireland,</HI> of which
the account is Printed in the la&s;t Tran&s;action; all which, and divers others
which I could mention, do &s;hew that the pre&s;ent &s;uperficial Parts of the Earth
have &s;uffer'd very great Alterations, which I in my Lectures in 1664. indea|vour'd
to prove to have been the effects of &s;ome preceding Earthquakes, with|out
which Suppo&s;ition I cannot conceive any probable Cau&s;e can be a&s;&s;igned,
much le&s;s can there be any &s;uch rational Cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned for the Po&s;ition of ma|ny
other Phaenomena which have been ob&s;erv'd of &s;uch like Sub&s;tances found
and dug up at much greater depths, that is, of more than two or three Fa|thoms
below the pre&s;ent Surface, at which depth tho&s;e I have mention'd are
&s;aid to be found. I conceive it will be very improbable to a&s;&s;ign the Cau&s;e to
the univer&s;al Deluge of <HI>Noah,</HI> and much more &s;o to
a&s;cribe it to any particular
Deluge, as to that of <HI>Deucalion,</HI> &amp;c. for how could the Flood bury the Shells of Fi&s;hes
in the middle of &s;ome of the highe&s;t <HI>Alps,</HI> and cover them with a prodigious height
or thickness of Rocky Mountains? Or how &s;hould the bottom of the Sea come to
be raised to &s;uch a prodigious height above the pre&s;ent bottom of the Sea at the
Shore next &s;uch places? To me, I confe&s;s, it &s;eems a mo&s;t improbable, and ground|le&s;s
&s;uppo&s;ition: Improbable, for that 'tis hardly conceivable how the Water
&s;hould heap up the&s;e Sub&s;tancess, &s;uch prodigious ma&s;&s;es of Stony or Earthy
Concretions; and groundle&s;s,
for that we have no mention in Sacred or Pro|phane
Hi&s;tory of any &s;uch effects produced by a Flood. However, tho' we
&s;hould grant that Elephants might be carry'd by the Waters of the univer&s;al
Deluge from the more Southern or Aequinoctial Parts to tho&s;e Northern of
<HI>Siberia</HI> or <HI>Pomerania,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a ship found buried deep in the Ground.</NOTE> yet how &s;hall we conceive by what means the univer&s;al
Deluge &s;hould bury a Ship and forty Men at a hundred Fathom under Ground,
and that at &s;o great a di&s;tance from the Sea, as <HI>Switzerland</HI> now is, of which
neverthele&s;s we have an undoubted Hi&s;tory? I &s;ay undoubted, becau&s;e I
have not found any Author that has que&s;tion'd the truth of this Relation.
Now, tho' I confe&s;s I did not know 'till lately (upon peru&s;ing Dr. <HI>Wagners</HI>
curicus Natural History of <HI>Switzerland</HI>) who inform'd me who was the fir&s;t
Hi&s;torian that had acquainted the World with this di&s;covery, tno' I had met
with the account in &s;everal other Hi&s;torians, yet none of them &s;peaking of it
with any doubting Expre&s;&s;ion I conceiv'd it mu&s;t be related by &s;ome Hi&s;torian
of good Repute. This Enquiry then Dr. <HI>Wagner</HI> an&s;wer'd by telling me the
fir&s;t relater of it, which was <HI>Bapti&s;ta Fulgo&s;t</HI> Duke of <HI>Genoua,</HI> which Author's
Book I have &s;ince procur'd, and have read his Account of it, which I will pre|&s;ently
give you as I find it expre&s;&s;'d by <HI>Camillus Gilnus</HI> in Elegant Latine, be|ing
by him&s;elf, and his Father tran&s;lated from the Original, Publi&s;h'd by the
Author in the Year 1483, but the Book tran&s;lated into Latin was Printed
1565. In this Book I find an account of the Author, and the E&s;teem he had,
and the occa&s;ion of the writing of it, which was partly to drive away melan|choly
Reflections on his pa&s;t Misfortunes, having lo&s;t his Dukedome, and
partly for In&s;truction to his own Son. In which Relation 'tis remarkable, that
this Ship and Men &s;hould be buried &s;o deep in the Earth as a hundred Fa|thom
or &s;ix hundred Foot. Next, that the Bodies of forty Men &s;hould be
found in the Ship it&s;elf. <HI>3dly.</HI> That this &s;hould be a Ship of the Ocean, and
not of &s;ome River, becau&s;e of the great di&s;tance of it from the Sea. <HI>4thly.</HI>
That the Anchors and Sails, tho' torn, &s;hould yet remain and be plainly' di&s;|coverable.
<HI>5thly.</HI> That he did not take this Story from uncertain Report,
but from divers grave Men, who had been Eye-witne&s;&s;es of it, who had in|form'd
him them&s;elves. <HI>6thly.</HI> That it was &s;o remarkable in that time, that
the Learned Men had meditated and rea&s;on'd on it to a&s;&s;ign the Cau&s;e of it;
that is, to give a rational Hypothe&s;is, by which to &s;hew how it might come
to pa&s;&s;; they having it &s;eems pitch'd upon two e&s;pecially, which do both of
them to me &s;eem very insufficient, not to &s;ay very ab&s;urd. So that upon the
whole Matter, there &s;eems to me no Rea&s;on or Cau&s;e to doubt the matter of
<PB N="440" REF="419">
Fact or the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, but all the difficulty lies in the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> that then &s;hall be the
next thing to be examin'd, and that the rather, becau&s;e this &s;eems to be a
true <HI>Experimentum Crucis</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h between my Hypothe&s;is and tho&s;e of
&s;ome other Authors. As fir&s;t, concerning the two Solution &s;pecify'd by the
Author, not as his own, but as of &s;ome other Philo&s;ophical Men, who then
lived, and who were &s;atisfy'd, it &s;eems, of the truth of the di&s;covery, and 'tis
not unlikely it might be &s;ome of tho&s;e. <HI>Plurimi Graves viri qui rem per&s;pexerunt
&amp; qui in Re pre&s;enti fuere a quibus ip&s;e accepit.</HI> For as for him&s;elf he ventures
not at any Solution, but &s;ays only <HI>Caeterum utcunq; res fuerit admirationis non
Mediocres relinquit Cau&s;as.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, for the Hypothe&s;is of <HI>Noah's</HI> Flood,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>That it could not be from</HI> Noah's <HI>time.</HI></NOTE> 'tis not &s;aid in any Hi&s;to|ry,
that Navigation, e&s;pecially on the Ocean, was grown to &s;uch a perfection
in <HI>Noah's</HI> time as to make Ships of that bigne&s;s and perfection of Anchors,
Sail and Rigging, as this by this &s;hort De&s;cription &s;eems to have been;
and 'tis very likely if any &s;uch Navigation had been, it would have been ta|ken
notice of in the Hi&s;tory of the Bible; for it cannot be &s;uppos'd that
<HI>Noah</HI> &s;hould not be inform'd of it, if any &s;uch Art had been then practiced in
any part of the World how remote &s;oever from the place of his Abode. Next,
if &s;uch &s;hould have been, it might have happen'd that &s;ome ther Men or
Creatures might have e&s;cap'd with Life be&s;ides tho&s;e in the Ark. Next, &s;up|po&s;ing
that there had been &s;uch a perfection of Navigation at the time of the
Flood, I cannot conceive how a Ship of that bigne&s;s, as this &s;eems to have
been, &s;hould be carry'd down &s;o deep under the surface of the Earth as 600
Foot: Certainly a twelve Month &s;oaking of the Earth, much le&s;s forty Days,
could not reduce the &s;uperficial Parts to &s;uch a ha&s;ty pudding Con&s;i&s;tence as
this Phaenomenon does &s;eem to require, &s;ince I doubt whether there can be
found the World any part of the bottom of the Sea, that has been &s;oaked
for &s;ome thou&s;ands of Years, that is &s;o &s;oftned.</P>
<P>Next for the &s;econd Hypothe&s;is of a Subterraneous Navigation, to me, I
confe&s;s it &s;eems a ridiculous Suppo&s;ition, tho' I know a late Author has im|brac'd
&s;uch an Hypothe&s;is to &s;olve the Phaenomena of Sea-&s;hells, and the like
Sub&s;tances found in Mountains and Mines; tho' Mr. <HI>Purchas</HI> has Publi&s;h'd a
like Story of <HI>Andrew Knivet,</HI> but I am apt to think that mo&s;t Readers will
look upon it as told by a Seaman and a Traveller.</P>
<P>But the Matter of Fact being &s;o well atte&s;ted, it mu&s;t at lea&s;t be &s;uppos'd
to be there plac'd by &s;ome Natural Cau&s;e, as mu&s;t al&s;o all tho&s;e other Phaeno|mena
I have ment'on'd.</P>
<P>Now for a&s;&s;igning a Cau&s;e &s;ufficient, I conceive there cannot be a more
probable one, than the effect of Earthquakes, which have, and do &s;till pro|duce
as con&s;iderable Effects as any of the&s;e; the late Relations we have had
of the effects wrought by them in <HI>Lima, $word$,</HI> among the <HI>Cariby</HI> I&s;lands, a|mong
the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> I&s;lands, about <HI>$word$,</HI> in <HI>Norway,</HI> and in the I&s;land of
<HI>Sicily,</HI> will furni&s;h us with Phaenomena almo&s;t as &s;trange; be&s;ides it &s;eems ra|tional
to believe, that Earthquakes in former Ages before we had Hi&s;tory,
were not only more frequent, but much greater and more powerful.</P>
<P>The&s;e, I conceive, have not only produc'd wonderful Effects in this or that
part of the Earth at one time, but at many times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, po&s;&s;ibly at the
di&s;tance of many Ages; &s;o that at one time they may have rai&s;ed the bottom of
the Sea to make a dry Land, and &s;unk other parts &s;o as to be overflow'd by
the Sea, which were before far above the Surface of the Water, or to make
Inland Seas or Lakes, as that of <HI>Geneva</HI> and divers others thereabouts: But
by &s;ucceeding Earthquakes tho&s;e effects may have been quite differing, &s;o as
to &s;ink again tho&s;e parts it had rai&s;ed, and rai&s;e again and fill up with other
Earthy or Stony Matter, tho&s;e it had formerly &s;unk, and &s;o al&s;o by various
Efforts at various Times it may have overturn'd and turn'd up&s;ide down, or
otherwi&s;e tumbl'd and confounded the parts of the Earth, which &s;eems plainly
to be hinted to us by the Mythologick Story of the Giants fighting with the
Caele&s;tial Powers, and heaping Mountains upon Mountains; and (I do confe&s;s)
I conceive there can be nothing more rea&s;onable and conformable to the pro|ceeding
of Nature in the&s;e Times, than to &s;uppo&s;e there have been the like and
much greater, in former Ages of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="441" REF="420">
I conceive then, that whenever that part of <HI>Switzerland</HI> was the bottom of
the Sea, this Ve&s;&s;el (which the Author calls <HI>Navis</HI> or a Ship) was upon that
Sea over this very place, when there happen'd an Earthquake ju&s;t underneath
it, which did rai&s;e the &s;ame above the level of the Water, as much as it now
is; and that by this there having happen'd to be an Opening, Clearing, or
Cha&s;m in the Ground under it which &s;wallow'd up &s;ome of the
Sea; and with
it this Ve&s;&s;el, and afterwards clo&s;ed again, and inclo&s;ed what it had &s;wallow|ed;
or el&s;e that this part had been &s;ome very deep Inland Lake, as that of
<HI>Geneva,</HI> and divers others there about, that this Ve&s;&s;el was Navigating in
this place when &s;ome Earthquake happen'd, which overthrew &s;ome Neigh|bouring
Mountain, Hill or Lands, which, falling into this Water, did not on|ly
&s;ink the Ship, but fill'd up and levell'd the Lake with the Contiguous Lands
or Shoars of it; neither of which ways of explicating it do need any other ef|fect,
but &s;uch as we are by antient and much more later Ob&s;ervations a&s;cer|tain'd,
are the u&s;ual effects of Earthquakes.</P>
<P>I have con&s;ider'd the Pa&s;&s;age mention'd by <HI>Leo. Bapt. Alberti</HI> in the fifth
Book and Twelfth Chapter, concerning <HI>Trajan's</HI> Ship found in his time in <HI>Ita|ly.</HI>
Now, I find that this <HI>Alberti</HI> was a <HI>Florentine</HI> Gentleman, who flouri&s;h'd
about the Year 1483, and was accounted the <HI>Vitruvius</HI> of his Time: He be|ing
a Scholar, an excellent Painter, Sculptor and Mechani&s;t, and an excel|lent

di&s;cover'd in <HI>Alberti's</HI> Time, which had lain &s;unk in a Lake of <HI>Italy,</HI> which
he calls <HI>Nemoren&s;is,</HI> ever &s;ince the time of <HI>Trajan,</HI> which was near one hundr|ed
Years after Chri&s;t, for he died in the Year ninty eight, which is now full
&s;ixteen Hundred Years &s;ince, and &s;o was more than thirteen Hundred in the
time of <HI>Alberti.</HI> The Pa&s;&s;age is as follows. <HI>Leo Bapti&s;ta Albert$s De Re Aedi|ficatoria.

of it, I have not met with, nor can I find any &s;uch Lake as is call'd <HI>Lacus Ne|morea&s;is,</HI>
or <HI>Nenoren&s;i Lago,</HI> as <HI>Petrus Laurus,</HI> in his Tran&s;lation of this Book
into the Vulgar <HI>Italian</HI> renders it. <HI>Bartoli,</HI> who Tran&s;lated this Book into <HI>Ita|lian</HI>
after <HI>Causes</HI> renders it <HI>Lago della $word$</HI> indeed mentions a Ship
of <HI>Layus,</HI> which was purpo&s;ely &s;unk at <HI>O&s;tia</HI> to found the Mole upon; but he
could not &s;ay any thing of this, he dying almo&s;t 20 Years before <HI>Trajans</HI> time;
nor do I treat upon what occa&s;ion it was that caus'd them to dig it out, nor
at what depth it was found, nor whether it were buried in the Ground, or
were only &s;unk into the Mud: If any have met with any further information
concerning it in their Reading, I &s;hould be glad to be inform'd concerning it.
<HI>Fulgo&s;us</HI> having writ his Book much about the &s;ame time that <HI>Alberti</HI> writ this,
I thought I might have met with &s;ome account of it in him, it being &s;ome-what
Analogous with his Relation of the Ship found in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> about the
&s;ame time; but I do not find he hath any mention of it. It &s;eems pretty
&s;trange how either of the&s;e Ships &s;hould come to be tran&s;ported
into the places
where they are &s;aid to be found; but 'till we know the Hi&s;tory we can at
be&s;t but conjecture concerning them. There are many other particulars I
&s;hould have defir'd information of be&s;ides tho&s;e which he has mention'd, and
'tis very likely &s;ome of them may have been taken notice of in the Relation
of its di&s;covery, which I am inclin'd to believe mu&s;t be &s;omewhat more at large
and more fully related than we find it here, which Only hints two Remarkables
<PB N="442" REF="421">
proper to the purpo&s;e, for which it is mention'd, <HI>viz.</HI> About the durablene&s;s
of Timber fit for building of Ships in its own Nature: And, Secondly, Of
the way of &s;ecuring it again&s;t the Corro&s;ion of Worms, which it &s;eems was &s;o
long &s;ince taken notice of and provided again&s;t by the Shipwhrites of <HI>Trajan</HI>'s
Time; which they perform'd by a double Sheathing; the fir&s;t, next the double
Planking, (<HI>Tabulis extrin&s;ecus duplicem Superexten&s;am &amp; pice, atra perfu&s;am tela
ex lino adglutinarant</HI>) was a kind of Tarpollin, they covering the Planks with
Pitch, and that Pitch with Linnen-cloth &s;ticking to it; the &s;econd was a thin
&s;heet of Lead fa&s;tn'd by Bra&s;s Nails to the-Plank;, that it was very thin, I think
is denoted by <HI>Charta Plumbea,</HI> that is, &s;uch kind of thin Lead as they formerly
us'd for Writing on, much like the thinne&s;t &s;ort of Mill'd-Lead now made by
the new Engine; which how they made is not known, nor do we certainly
know how they make the like Sheets of Lead in <HI>China,</HI> of which kind I have
&s;een a great variety, and all of it very even and regular: The Plumber will
tell you 'tis done by Ca&s;ting the Lead on Ticking, but that I conceive will
not make it &s;o thin and even as I have &s;een it; we have a way of beating it
after the manner of Gold-beating, which doth foliate it very thin and even,
'tis commonly call'd <HI>Tin Foile,</HI> and 'tis us'd for foiling Looking-gla&s;&s;es; 'tis a
mixture of Lead and Tin, as is al&s;o the <HI>Tootenag</HI> of <HI>China,</HI> and po&s;&s;ibly theirs
may be done the &s;ame way; but the Rowlers in the Mill I take to be much the
better way; 'tis by &s;ome&s;uch. Engine they foliate Bra&s;s and Copper in <HI>Germany,</HI>
tho' they do &s;ome &s;orts al&s;o with the Hammer, as Kettles, and the thin Iron Plates
for Latton by beating many of them together at once, as they do al&s;o Leaf-gold,
Silver and Bra&s;s; but A&s;idue &s;omewhat thicker, is done by an Engine with
Rowlers, as they flatten Wire for Threads; and To al&s;o is a &s;ort of Sheet Bra&s;s
&s;omewhat thicker: Po&s;&s;ibly both ways may be known and made u&s;e of in
<HI>China,</HI> where they have many other curious Inventions which we have not
yet attain'd, and 'tis not unlikely but that the Antient <HI>Romans</HI> might for this
foliating of Lead, have &s;omewhat the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Now as to the u&s;e of it for Sheathing of Ships, I find the <HI>Spamard,</HI> make u&s;e
of it at this time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sheathing Ships with lead known in the <HI>Romans.</HI></NOTE> and have done &s;o for a long time. This I find Sir <HI>Rich-Hawkins</HI>
takes notice of in the account of his Voyage to the South Sea, Page 87,
which &s;ee.</P>
<P>Here we have an account of all the ways of Sheathing of Ships he knew,
and his Judgment or Cen&s;ure of them, which how ju&s;t they, are mu&s;t be left to
Experienc'd Men; however, I have been lately inform'd that the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
make u&s;e of the &s;ame way &s;till for their Gillions, which 'tis not likely they
would if they knew any way better; they had indeed another help to keep
out the Water in ca&s;e of any failure in the outward Plant, and that is the fil|ling
all the Space between the Ribbs and Planks with a certain &s;ort of Plai&s;ter
which may be a &s;ecurity to the innermo&s;t Plank, but not at all to the outermo&s;t
again&s;t the Worm or Springing of them; however, 'tis of good u&s;e to keep off
&s;uddain overflow or entrance of the Water in ca&s;e of either Defect. But the
be&s;t way of all &s;eems to be the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> by the Varni&s;h, which neither
Worms nor Water, nor Heat will damnify; nor in their way of building their
junks, do they leave any vacuity in the thickne&s;s of the &s;ides to need Plai&s;ter,
but what is fill'd with Damar, which is in it&s;elf lighter than Water, and will
&s;wim on it. But that way is not practicable here in <HI>Europe</HI> where we want the
Varni&s;h, whereas the others are, e&s;pecially that of Sheet Lead, of which
Metal this Nation affords us great plenty, and the late invented Mill doth
certainly out do all other for giving it a proper Form; be&s;ides, if Plai&s;ter
were necessary, we have as good as the World affords, or which po&s;&s;ibly may
be better, we can have Pitch enough (much of the &s;ame Nature and U&s;e
with Damar) to prevent any &s;uddain gu&s;hing in of the Water: But this only
by the bye:</P>
<P>The &s;trangene&s;s of the Relation or Hi&s;tory of the Ship found &s;unk in a
Lake, &s;ome where in <HI>Italy,</HI> mention'd by <HI>Leo. Bapt. Albert,</HI> and the &s;hort|ne&s;s
and imperfection thereof as deliver'd by him, made me very de&s;irio us to
get a more full and perfect Relation thereof. I thought <HI>Bay&s;ius</HI> in his Treati&s;e
<HI>De Re Navali</HI> might have taken notice of it, he having Written &s;ince that
time; but he has never a word concerning it as I can find, nor do I find any
<PB N="443" REF="422" MS="Y">
mention of it in <HI>Da&s;&s;ie</HI>'s Book <HI>de L' Architecture Navale;</HI> but <HI>Pere Fournier</HI> in
his Hydrography (Book the Fourth, Chap, the Fir&s;t) treating of the Naviga|tion
which was before the univer&s;al Deluge of <HI>Noah,</HI> &s;ays, it &s;eems rational to
think that (con&s;idering the long Life of Men before the Flood, and the po|pulou&s;ne&s;s
of tho&s;e Times) there was no part of the World uninhabited, tho'
we have no Hi&s;tory of them but the Bible, and tho' that has not one word
concerning it; and that not only the great Continents of Land, but there be|ing
I&s;lands both in the Seas and Rivers, tho&s;e al&s;o were inhabited which
could not be &s;uppos'd without the u&s;e of &s;ome kind of Navigation. Add to
this in the third place, that 'tis rea&s;onable to think that the <HI>Antediluvians</HI>
were as ingenious, if not much more, than the <HI>Po&s;tdiluvians,</HI> for the invent|ing
of Ships, and for the u&s;e of them, for the tran&s;planing of Colonies, for
Trading and for War. Moreover (&s;ays he) in the Year 1462, as is Record|ed
by <HI>Fulgo&s;us,</HI> at <HI>Bern</HI> in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> as they were working in the Mines, at
above a hundred Fathom deep in the Earth, there was found an old Wood|en
Ship built as ours are, who&s;e Anchors were of Iron and the Sails of Lin|en,
with the Carka&s;&s;es of forty Men. <HI>Peirre Naxis</HI> Relates a like Hi&s;to|ry
of another, &s;uch a one as was found under a very high Mountain. In like
manner the Je&s;uite <HI>Eu&s;ebius Neurembergius,</HI> in the Second Chapter of the Fifth
Book of his Natural Hi&s;tory, &s;ays, &startq;That near the Port of <HI>Lima</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> as
they were working a Mine for Gold, tho&s;e which follow'd the Vein in the
Mountain found an old Ship, which had many old Characters very differing
from ours, which ail People believed to have been there buried by the uni|ver&s;al
Deluge.&endq;&mdash;<HI>Nam&abque; Juxt a portum Lime in Peru cum evi&s;cerar at

there was never yet found any Elephant. &startq;Without doubt (&s;ays he) all
the&s;e things have been thus buried by the tumbling and overturnings of a
univer&s;al Deluge, as well as the Wreeks of other Ve&s;&s;els which have been
found at three Thou&s;and Stadiums or Furlongs from the Sea, as <HI>Strabo</HI> re|lates
in his Fir&s;t Book.&endq;
Thus far Father <HI>Fournier</HI> to this purpo&s;e. Nor do I
find that he hath taken any notice or made the lea&s;t mention of this Ve&s;&s;el,
mention'd by <HI>Alberti,</HI> which, methinks, he &s;hould not have been ignorant of,
e&s;pecially con&s;idering the great Pains he has taken, and great Learning he
hath &s;hewn concerning the Subject of Shipping.</P>
<P>The <HI>Heer Wit&s;en</HI> in his Book intitled, <HI>Ael Oude en Hoden duey&s;one Scheeps
Bouven Ba&s;tier,</HI> in the Fourth Chapter of his Fir&s;t Book, hath given us a
&s;omewhat larger account and more particular than <HI>Alberti,</HI> but quotes not the
Authors from whom he receiv'd it; &s;o that we mu&s;t rely on his Reputation
'till we can be better inform'd. His Relation in <HI>Dutch</HI> is to this effect.
&startq;In the time that the Pope, <HI>Pius</HI> the Second, po&s;&s;e&s;t the Chair (which I find was
from <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1458, to <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1464) Men found in the <HI>Numidi&s;che</HI> Lake twelve
Fathom under Water, in the Mud, a Ship, in length thirty Foot, and in
breadth proportionable; built of <HI>Cypre&s;s</HI> and <HI>Larix</HI> Wood (which is a Species
of Pine-Tree Wood) which was become of &s;uch an hardne&s;s, that it could
neither be burnt nor broken, if it were needful. This Ship had lain under
the Water for fourteen Hundred Years without the lea&s;t perceivable Rotting
to decay it: It was on the Deck done over with Pitch, and that cover'd with
a Coat or Cru&s;t of a certain Pap or Morter made of Clay and Iron well tem|per'd
or beaten together, which art of mixtura is now conceil'd; tho' others
are of Opinion that this mixture was not made of Clay and Iron, but of Clay
and Pitch well kneaded together. The Deck was cover'd with Paper, Lin|nen
Cloth, and Plates of Lead, which were nailed to the Planks with Cop|per
Nails guilded. This Ship (a wonder) was found &s;o &s;tanch, that not the
lea&s;t drop of Water was found to have &s;oaked into its Hold; it had the length
of an old <HI>Trireme</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, and the breadth of a Hulk. In the Hold was
found the Hangings of fine Velvet of an Orange Green, and in the mid|dle
of the Floor a Copper Coffer fa&s;tned by four black Strings, which being
open'd there appear'd an Earthen Urne or Ve&s;&s;el, which was ornamented
<PB N="444" REF="423">
with a Gold Plate, and fill'd with A&s;hes; and becau&s;e Men &s;aw the Name
<HI>Tiberius,</HI> &s;everal times engraven upon &s;ome Leaden Plates about the Border
of it, they conceiv'd this might be the place of his Sepulture.&endq;</P>
<P>This Account, tho' in divers Particulars different from that of <HI>Alberti,</HI> yet
&s;eems to be tran&s;lated from the &s;ame Original Hi&s;tory, which neither for them
having mention'd by what Author it was written, we are yet to &s;eek of the
true account, which probably may be much more particular than either of
the&s;e, or both of them put together; for that it is u&s;ual in &s;ecoud Hand Re|lations,
to take notice of &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages of the Original, as concern the pre|&s;ent
Subject they are treating of, and to omit many other Particulars, tho' in
them&s;elves much more remarkable; this therefore I further &s;ought for in di|vers
other Authors; and in <HI>Riccioli</HI>'s <HI>Hydrography,</HI> I found a further account
of it, which al&s;o gave me a hint of the true Author: <HI>Riccioli</HI>'s Account is
this, Chapter the thirty ninth of the Tenth Book, which whole Chapter
treats of Ships that have been much celebrated for their Magnitude, Splen|dor,
Voyages, or other very remarkable Conditions; among which, Page
340, he brings in the Ship of <HI>Tiberius</HI> as one very remarkable in&s;tance, who&s;e
Hi&s;tory he thus de&s;cribes, <HI>Narrat Aeneas Sylvius, &s;uo tempore repertum in
lacu Numicio Cubitis</HI> 12 <HI>Sub aquam, navem ex Larice Cubitorum</HI> 2$ <HI>Bitumine &amp;

<P>Thus we have found at length the Bu&s;h where this Game is &s;eated, and
whence it is to be &s;tarted if we will have it, and I have follow'd it by its &s;cent
and Foot-&s;teps to its Seat; but in what part of the Volume of the Works of
<HI>Aeneas Sylvius,</HI> it is to be found I cannot yet di&s;cover, for his Tracts are many
and make a bulky Volume together, which, whether it contain all that he
writ I am not yet well inform'd; for he wrote very many particular Tracts,
and left &s;ome imperfect and not ready for the Pre&s;s, as <HI>Conrad Ge&s;ner,</HI> informs
us. This was the Man that, in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1458, was made Pope, and who died in
<HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1464, &s;o that he po&s;&s;e&s;t the Chair &s;ix Year; within which time it
&s;eems both the&s;e di&s;coveries were made, (if at lea&s;t they were two differing
Di&s;coveries, for po&s;&s;ibly they may be only two differing Relations of the &s;ame
Di&s;covery) the one noting one &s;ort of Circum&s;tances, and the other, another.
I cannot &s;o well judge of the matter, 'till I find this Relation of <HI>Sylvtus;</HI> how|ever,
'tis obvious that what <HI>Riccioli,</HI> makes to be only twelve Cubits, Mr.
<HI>Wit&s;en,</HI> makes twelve Fathom, which is four times as much; and po&s;&s;ibly this
twelve Fathom or &s;eventy two Foot <HI>Fulgo&s;us,</HI> might make one hundred Cubits,
and yet all of them innocently without a de&s;ign of impo&s;ing on their Readers,
they writing from the Relations of others, and po&s;&s;ibly from the failing of
their own Memory to boot; for we find how rare a thing it is to find out the
truth of a Fact, tho' twas done but Ye&s;terday and almo&s;t at next Door, if
allowances are not made for the Circum&s;tances of the Relators, and the de|fects
of every one's Memory and Comprehen&s;ion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide Pbilo&s;. Tran&s;act. No. 234, p. 757.</NOTE> upon which account it is
that I could wi&s;h that Relation concerning the Elephant lately found in <HI>Ger|many,</HI>
and made by the Colledge of <HI>Gothan,</HI> might be in&s;erted into a Tran&s;|action
as well as that of <HI>Tentzelius,</HI> that Men might &s;ee how much the Hu|mour
and Inclinations of the Relators will diver&s;ify the Relation, and confound
the Apprehen&s;ion and Judgment of the Reader; and therefore I conceive it
would not be ami&s;s al&s;o to add to this la&s;t account the Sentiments of this So|ciety,
or at lea&s;t of &s;ome of their Members, concerning the Sub&s;tances &s;ent
by <HI>Tentzelius,</HI> to be perus'd and examin'd by them; for there is no better way,
I conceive, in the World to give a &s;atisfactory account to Po&s;terity of this
Fact than this Cour&s;e; for there cannot be made a good Hi&s;tory, either of
things Natural or Artificial, without curious judicious and accurate Ob&s;ervations,
and Pertinent and Critical Experiments, that may be as thoroughly ex|amin'd
and verify'd, as a Geometrical Propo&s;ition by Per&s;ons &s;ufficiently accomp|li&s;h'd
for &s;uch a Task. 'Tis not one po&s;&s;ibly of a hundred is fit for &s;uch a Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
and yet &s;uch are nece&s;&s;ary, and hence I conceive it is, that we have
&s;uch a multitude of medicinal Ob&s;ervations made or pretended to be made by
young Phy&s;icians, and po&s;&s;ibly not one of five Hundred of any manner of real
<PB N="445" REF="424">
U&s;e or Benefit; for that the mo&s;t of &s;uch Writers are two much bia&s;&s;ed by
precarious Hypothe&s;es, and many likewise Compo&s;e and Publi&s;h them only
for Intere&s;t, that is, as Adverti&s;ements to make them&s;elves the more known,
and &s;o to get Practice; and tho' this or that Symptom may be true and ma|tter
of Fact, yet the true Cau&s;e of the Di&s;temper, and the rea&s;on of the Cure
or Mi&s;carriage of the Patient po&s;&s;ibly was really quite differing from tho&s;e a&s;|&s;ign'd
by them; and tho' &s;ome of them may have been truly de&s;crib'd, yet
tho&s;e that know how &s;mall and incon&s;iderable Circum&s;tances in them&s;elves
will yet make great and mo&s;t considerable alterations in the Effects, will be
more cautious than to take them all for true which are in reality quite other|wi&s;e;
tho&s;e therefore that relate an Experiment or Ob&s;ervation, &s;hould be
both very under&s;tanding in the Subject, and very diligent in taking notice of,
and relating the Circum&s;tances of it; for that all that can be done in this way
will be little enough of information to him, that is to make u&s;e of it for
making Deductions and Inferrences therefrom, and indeed it will be hazar|dous
to build any thing upon Foundations &s;o uncertain; for even in the
mo&s;t perfect Accounts of this Nature, a Writer or Applier of it for the
founding or examining a Theory thereby will find a nece&s;&s;ity of ocular in|&s;pection
and examination proper and fitted to his pre&s;ent Subject, either
to obviate &s;ome Objection, or to give &s;ome further Light; for oft times the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the whole Experiment may lie in &s;ome one trivial
Circum&s;tance, which not one of a thou&s;and would otherwi&s;e have thought
worth taking notice of, yet to him that knows what that Circum&s;tance is
that makes for or again&s;t his Theory which he is inquiring into, will judge
it very con&s;iderable, and be &s;ure not to omit the Scrutiny and Te&s;t there|of;
and 'tis prepo&s;terous for any one to write an Experimental Natural Hi|&s;tory
without making and examining the Experiments needful to the per|fecting
thereof, without making the Experiments him&s;elf, nay, and with|out
the repeating of them, as Doubts may ari&s;e after the fir&s;t Trial, or
as he may need further information upon them; nay, without making them
whil&s;t he is writing, that he may tru&s;t, as little as may be, to his own Me|mory
and Judgment. Thus in Anatomical Experiments and Ob&s;ervations,
how many con&s;iderable Di&s;coveries do we owe to &s;uch repeated Trials o|mitted
wholly, or &s;carce hinted at in many preceding; For every di&s;covery
gives a new &s;et of Doubts and Inquiries, as well as a new Light, not only
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> <HI>Sed etiam decies repetita placebunt,</HI> as I have very often experimented
my &s;elf; $ay, I have found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and even that not enough to
make &s;ome Spectator to apprehend the Con&s;equences thereof: But this only
by the bye. Before I leave this Subject I cannot but take notice of a Doubt
that ari&s;es from the variety of the&s;e Relations, and that is, whether the
Sheet Lead were u&s;ed for the Sheathing of the out&s;ides of the Ship under
Water, or only for the Covering and Hou&s;ing of the Deck, as the <HI>Heer Wit|&s;en</HI>
makes it; nor know I how to &s;olve it without &s;eeing the Original Relation,
only I mu&s;t not omit one Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Riccioli,</HI> which &s;eems to hint the u&s;e of
Sheet Lead &s;omewhat Analogous to Sheathing, and that is this, de&s;cribing
the Ship of <HI>Hieron,</HI> who&s;e Architect was <HI>Archimedes.&mdash;Dimedia Pars navis
per</HI> 300 <HI>operartios &s;ex men&s;ibus ab&s;oluta, rimae a&s;&s;erum laminis plumbeis tectae,</HI> &amp;c.
My doubt on this Pa&s;&s;age is, whether the Ve&s;&s;el were Caulked and Pitched
in the Joints of the Planks under the Sheet Lead, or whether the Plates of

is at large in <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> which I have not by me, and he, it &s;eems, had
it from&mdash;, who writ a whole Book of the De&s;cription of it: It was
in this Ship where <HI>Archimedes</HI> made u&s;e of his admirable Invention of his
helical Pump, which he him&s;elf hath no where de&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>The &s;mall number of Authors that have recorded &s;o remarkable a Phaeno|menon
as this, informs us how little curious the World have been in the mat|ter
of Philo&s;ophical Hi&s;tory, and thence how vain a thing it is to expect to
find every &s;uch accident as this to be Recorded, tho' very remarkable in its
&s;elf; for if the&s;e Ships were differing, then they have each but one Original
Hi&s;torian; for all the other Authors that have &s;ince mention'd them, &s;eem to
have borrow'd the Accounts from the&s;e two; but if the Relations were
<PB N="446" REF="425">
only of one and the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el, (as methinks the Circum&s;tances of the time
and the being &s;unk deep into the Earth &s;eem to intimate) then we have but
two Hi&s;torians that take notice of &s;o remarkable a Fact; and tho&s;e &s;o di&s;cor|dant
in their Stories, that one knows not which of them to give Credit to;
the one making it to be found in the <HI>Lago de Nemi,</HI> about twenty Miles
from <HI>Rome</HI> towards the We&s;t; the other making it to be found near <HI>Berne</HI> in
<HI>Switzerland,</HI> when 'tis not known that ever there was any Lake there, as
<HI>Fulgo&s;us</HI> mentions and Objects. It is therefore unrea&s;onable to reject all Hy|pothe&s;es
that &s;uppo&s;e other Accidents to have been the occa&s;ions of produc|ing
Petrify'd Sub&s;tances, than tho&s;e Recorded in Hi&s;tory, e&s;pecially if they
happen'd before Printing was in u&s;e, or po&s;&s;ibly Writing commonly known;
for even &s;ince that time many considerable Phaenomena have been very &s;light|ly
hinted only, and &s;carce taken any notice of; as for in&s;tance, the Comet
that appear'd in 1580, which produc'd but one diligent Observer and Hi&s;to|rian,
which was <HI>Mich. Ma&s;tlin,</HI> and the great Earthquakes and Cata&s;tro|phies
in <HI>China,</HI> which are Recorded in the <HI>Mercurie Hollandois,</HI> and no
where el&s;e that I know: So 'tis probable this newly happening Earthquake at
<HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> would have been quickly forgotten, and probably never record|ed
to Po&s;terity, if the <HI>Gazett</HI> and News Papers had not taken notice of it$
But this only by the way.</P>
<P>As to this accident of the Ship, I conceive it to have afforded &s;o many par|ticular
Informations worthy to have been Recorded, that I could wi&s;h it had
happen'd in a more curious Age; at lea&s;t I conceive it very de&s;irable, that the
Original Hi&s;tory of it, &s;uch as it is, might be &s;ifted out and in&s;erted in a
more proper place to be found, than where it is &s;aid to be at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Memoires of the <HI>Pari&s;ian Academy</HI> have furni&s;h'd many curious Di&s;|coveries
both Mathematical and Phy&s;ical,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The misfortune of Inventors.</NOTE> yet divers of them or of the
&s;ame kind have been fir&s;t di&s;cover'd in this Society, tho' not entertain'd with
that approbation, which they have there met withal; nor are the <HI>English</HI> &s;o
nimble in Publi&s;hing what they di&s;cover them&s;elves, nor &s;o &s;harping to arro|gate
to them&s;elves what they know to have been fir&s;t di&s;cover'd by others;
(as I do find divers to be) who will leave no means unattempted to make all
their own, tho' there be never &s;o evident Arguments again&s;t their Cau&s;e.
But tho' this be a Practice to be abhor'd by every ingenious Man, and the
ba&s;hfulne&s;s of the other be blameable, yet there is &s;omewhat to be &s;aid both
for the one and the other Party, that may &s;eem to countenance the&s;e procee|dings
of them. As fir&s;t, 'tis a di&s;couragement to any one to Publi&s;h that which
he finds by Di&s;cour&s;e is generally di&s;approved. A Man may rationally e|nough
di&s;tru&s;t his own Thoughts and Rea&s;ons, may, and even his Sen&s;es too,
if he finds tho&s;e he conver&s;es with to be of another Opinion, tho' acquaint|ed
with the Arguments that prevail'd with him, at lea&s;t till he finds, that it
was done for &s;ome Sini&s;ter De&s;igns to defraud him of his Di&s;covery. Next,
when by publi&s;hing, more Opponents or Emulators (which are both Enemies)
are produced, than approvers or indifferent Per&s;ons, who at be&s;t will do
him no good; 'tis thought better to ab&s;tain with quietne&s;s, than with Labour
and $ndu&s;try, to create new Troubles. But on the other &s;ide 'tis certain,
however, that ambitious Minds will try all means to obtain their De&s;igns;
they find that &s;uch Practi&s;es often prevail, and therefore <HI>Quid tentare No$ebit;</HI>
they find that the generallity of Men are not much concern'd for the fir&s;t
Di&s;coverer, and that they u&s;ually take him for &s;uch, who fir&s;t acquainted them
with it; and for one Reader that can di&s;prove them, or detect them of Pla|giary,
there are a thou&s;and that can not, and for tho&s;e that can, they find
ways to evade and by Confidence carry the point, and even with a general
Approbation and Advantage: 'Tis, I confe&s;s, a general Ob&s;ervation, that
&s;eldom the fir&s;t Inventer reaps either Honour or Advantage by his Inven|tion,
but on the contrary, tho&s;e that come in at a &s;econd Hand acquire them
both.<NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$.</NOTE> But be it as it will, certain it is, that many Di&s;coveries pretended to
in the Works, of the <HI>French Academy,</HI> were fir&s;t made here and el&s;ewhere,
nay, and many of them publi&s;h'd too in Print, and &s;ome of them al&s;o in the
<HI>French</HI> Language, which yet they will not own, or mention to have &s;een. I
&s;hall in&s;tance but in two or three things: The Fir&s;t is that of <HI>Torricellius</HI> a|bout
<PB N="447" REF="426">
his Invention and Demon&s;tration of the <HI>Solidum Acutum Hyperbolicum,</HI>
which was Pabli&s;h'd by him, together with his other Works at <HI>Florence</HI> in the
Year 1644, and that without Contradiction by <HI>Roberval</HI> ever &s;ince; yet now
a Letter is trumpt up, and &s;ome Papers found that mu&s;t needs per&s;uade us
that <HI>Torricellius</HI> &s;tole it from <HI>Roberval.</HI> The like &s;lur is ca&s;t upon the Works
of Mr. <HI>James Gregory;</HI> both which Per&s;ons have given &s;ufficient Proofs by their
other Works, that they had very little need of &s;tealing from <HI>Roberval,</HI> who
has not yet made it evident, nor any other for him, that he was Ma&s;ter of
either of their Problems, 'till &s;ince the publication of them by the &s;aid Au|thors.</P>
<P>The Second is the di&s;covery of the Glade of Light ob&s;ervable in the E|venings
in <HI>Febr.</HI> and <HI>March</HI> each Year, which was fir&s;t made by our Dr. <HI>Chil|drey,</HI>
and an Adverti&s;ement of it Publi&s;h'd in his <HI>Britannia Baconica,</HI> in the
Year 1660; which Book was Tran&s;lated into <HI>French,</HI> and Publi&s;h'd at <HI>Paris</HI>
&s;oon after, which was long enough before it is pretended to be di&s;cover'd
there. However, the &s;econd Per&s;on has the Title of the di&s;covery, and the
fir&s;t is defrauded of his due Prai&s;e. I could add a hundred other Instances to
prove this A&s;&s;ertion; but I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent &s;pend time thereon, tho' it
may po&s;&s;ibly not pa&s;s without &s;ome Reflections on another Occa&s;ion, that e|very
one, as near as may be, may have his due Prai&s;e. For my own part, I
think it ingenuous to mention any thing of theirs, which I have occa&s;ion to
make u&s;e of, and to own all &s;uch things as theirs, as I find to be new or in|genious;
and that Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e I would give every one that which is due to
him. But, Secondly, Becau&s;e I find it nece&s;&s;ary to back a Doctrine with a
<HI>French Approbation.</HI> I know there are many things will not be regarded, 'till
they have that Stamp to make them current, and then they will readily pa&s;&s;
with the pre&s;ent Age and Humor.</P>
<P>In the Memoir of the 31&s;t. of <HI>June</HI> 1692, (&s;o 'tis marked) I find an Ob&s;er|vation
concerning a Petrify'd Sub&s;tance produc'd and examin'd by the <HI>Royal
Academy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Remark out of the</HI> French <HI>Memoires.</HI></NOTE> with &s;ome Reflections on it made by Mr. <HI>De la Hire,</HI> which becau&s;e
con&s;onant to &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;es I have formerly made in this place, I thought
might countenance &s;omewhat the Doctrine I then deliver'd, I have al&s;o
render'd the &s;ame in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> before I make Reflections upon the &s;ame.</P>
<P>&startq;The Cabinets (&s;ays he) of the curious are fill'd with all forts of Bodies
Petrify'd, as of Plants, Fruits, Woods, and of divers parts of Animals,
but Naturali&s;ts are not yet agreed about the cau&s;e of their Production; &s;ome
&s;uppo&s;ing them to be Stones &s;o &s;haped by accident, but others &s;uppo&s;e them
produced by a Water that has a power of converting tho&s;e &s;everal Sub|&s;tances
into Stone, after it has long pickled them; probable Rea&s;ons are
alledg'd for each Opinion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. <HI>L' Abbe de Lou$oys</HI> &s;ent to the <HI>Academy;</HI> a Petrifaction, which may
&s;erve to decide this Controver&s;y, namely, two peices of the Trunk of a
Palm converted into Stone, they were brought from <HI>Africa,</HI> with two other
pieces of a Palm ju&s;t like them, but not Petrify'd, the better to compare
them together; the Petrifactions are <HI>true Flints,</HI> as appears by their hard|ne&s;s,
by their Colour, and &s;omewhat of Tran&s;parency, by their Sound,
which is clear and &s;onorous, and by their Gravity, which is more than ten
times that of the unpetrify'd; yet the&s;e two Flints are &s;o like to the two
pieces of Wood, that there is no &s;hew of Rea&s;on to conceive, they &s;hould
be &s;o formed by chance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;One of the&s;e Flints which is two Foot long, and about four or five Inches
Diameter, is a piece of the Trunk of a Palm Barked of its Rind; in this
may be &s;een all the Fibres of the Wood of the bigne&s;s of &frac23; of a Line, &s;ome
of which are forked; they run the length of the Trunk and are hollow like
Pipes. The Pulp, which is between the Fibres, which &s;erves to join them
together, is chang'd into a kind of <HI>Gluten,</HI> but very hard.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. <HI>De la Hire</HI> gives a Rea&s;on of the hollowne&s;s of the Pipe, <HI>i. e.</HI> that
the outward Parts being dry'd before the middle, when they are dry, they
are by the outward Parts kept from &s;hrinking, and &s;o the Pipes become
&s;tretched from the Center outward (<HI>which is the &s;ame Rea&s;on with that I have
given for the blebbs that appear in the Gla&s;s drops.</HI>)&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="448" REF="427">
&startq;Now, tho' &s;ome might fancy (yet without the lea&s;t probability) that this
with &s;traight Fibres might thus be formed by chance, yet 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to
conceive &s;o of the other piece, which is a part of the bottom of the Trunk;
for this is not only compos'd of &s;treight Fibres as the other, but its Bark is
all garni&s;h'd with &s;mall Roots as big as one's little Finger, and about three
Inches long, which is cover'd with a thin Skin, which, contains an infinite of
&s;mall Fibres like Hairs; in the middle of each of the&s;e Fibres is a ligneous
Chord, that one may call its <HI>Nuel</HI> or Pith, about &frac13; of the bigne&s;s of one's
Finger, who&s;e hollow was fill'd with a Pithy extended Sub&s;tance. All which
Parts are al&s;o exactly &s;haped in the Flint, where are vi&s;ible not only the
long &s;treight Fibers, but the Roots and all the &s;mall Fibres of a blacki&s;h
tran&s;parent Sub&s;tance, but the Pith in the middle is of a whiti&s;h opaque
Sub&s;tance, and in the mo&s;t of the &s;mall Roots it is hollow; which Mr. <HI>De la
Hire</HI> conceives to proceed from the &s;ame Cau&s;e that he before a&s;&s;igned.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is evident therefore (&s;ays the Author) that this was no <HI>Lu&s;us Naturae,</HI>
but that the&s;e two Flints were originally two pieces of the Trunk of a Palm
afterwards chang'd into the Sub&s;tance of a Flint; and what <HI>Father Duchatz</HI>
reports in his Phy&s;ical and Mathematical Ob&s;ervations, doth decide the
Controver&s;y, and leaves it without doubt.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This Father there &s;ays, that the River that pa&s;&s;es by <HI>Bakan</HI> in the King|dom
of <HI>Ava,</HI> has, for the &s;pace of ten Leagues, or twenty eight Miles,
the vertue of Petrifying Wood, and that he had &s;een great Trees Petrify'd
thereby &s;o high as the Surface of the Water reached, but that the other
parts of them remained &s;till dry Wood. He adds, that tho&s;e Petrify'd
Woods were as hard as the Flints of a Fire-lock; and &s;uch indeed was the
ha$dne&s;s of the two pieces of which we have been &s;peaking.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This Account of <HI>Duchatz</HI> is to be found in the Second Volume of Ob&s;er|vations
made in the <HI>Indies</HI> by the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> &s;ent thither by the King of <HI>France,</HI>
but Corrected and Printed by the care of <HI>P. Gouye;</HI> I have not yet &s;een the
Book, but by the Account of it I find in the&s;e Memoires, I conceive it will
be well worth the procuring, as containing many other curious Ob&s;ervations,
and Hi&s;tories of Matter of Fact.&endq;</P>
<P>This Memoire of Mon&s;ieur <HI>De la Hire is much the &s;ame with what I have former|ly
pre&s;ented to this Honourable Society,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Remarks &amp; De|ductions from the former Ac|count.</HI></NOTE> and have Printed among &s;ome other Ob&s;ervations
made with <HI>Micro&s;copes,</HI> wherein I examin'd the Shape, the Colour,
the Hardne&s;s, the Weight, the Brittlene&s;s, the Incumbu&s;tiblene&s;s, the Soli|dity,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> of it; for I found it to be for its appearance to the naked Eye, per|fectly
like a piece of Wood, and to have the vi&s;ible Grain of Wood, and
farther by a Micro&s;cope, I found it to have all the Micro&s;copical Pores like
Wood; I found it of the colour of Wood, but of the hardne&s;s of a Flint,
and that it would cut Gla&s;s: I found its Weight to be to Water as 3 $word$, which
&s;eems to be much the &s;ame with this of Mr. <HI>De La H$re;</HI> only he compares
its weight to that of the Palm Wood, which, by his de&s;cription, must be
much lighter than Water, and mine was only comparative to Water. I found
it incumbu&s;tible in the Fire, tho' di&s;&s;olvable by corro&s;ive Liquors. I found it
Brittle and Friable like a Flint, and to feel cold to the touch, as a Stone, or
Mineral Body u&s;ually doth; from all which I concluded it to have, at fir&s;t,
been a piece of Wood, and afterwards, by &s;ome Petri$ying Water or Va|pour,
converted into the Sub&s;tance of a Stone or Flint. And I find that
from the very &s;ame Arguments, the <HI>French Academy</HI> draw the &s;ame Conclu&s;ions
as to this Sub&s;tance, and they confirm it by the Ob&s;ervation of <HI>P. Dumchatz;</HI>
this therefore pa&s;&s;ing there for a good Argument, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why it may
not al&s;o be a good Argument here, and why the &s;ame will not al&s;o pa&s;s for the
Petrifactions of other Bodies both Vegetable, as Leaves, Fruits, Roots, and
al&s;o Animal, as Shells, Bones, Teeth, Scales, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are found to have
the &s;ame Qualifications, that is, the Shapes, Colours, Textures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of
tho&s;e animate Sub&s;tances, nay, and often times the very Bodies them&s;elves
not Petrify'd, tho' included in Petrify'd Bodies, as Stones or Minerals; mu&s;t
the&s;e be que&s;tioned or rejected, only becau&s;e &s;uch Sub&s;tances are found in
places where we cannot give particular Hi&s;tories of their pri&s;tine E&s;tate, and
how they come to be there placed and transformed, or &s;o inclo&s;ed, or becau&s;e
<PB N="449" REF="428">
po&s;&s;ibly we are not able to produce patterns of Creatures now at hand, and
in being, which are exactly of the &s;ame Shape and Magnitude as the Acade|my
did produce, to Authorize, or at lea&s;t incline them to be of that Senti|ment;
certainly the &s;ame Argument that is cogent for the one, ought not
to be le&s;s valid for the other; for if the finding of Coines, Medals, Urnes,
and other Monuments of famous Per&s;ons, or Towns, or Uten&s;ils, be ad|mitted
for unque&s;tionable Proofs, that &s;uch Per&s;ons or things have, in for|mer
Times, had a being, certainly tho&s;e Petrifactions may be allowed to be
of equal Validity and Evidence, that there have been formerly &s;uch Vege|tables
or Animals. The&s;e are truly Authentick Antiquity not to be coun|terfeited,
the Stamps, and Impre&s;&s;ions, and Characters of Nature that are
beyond the Reach and Power of Humane Wit and Invention, and are true
univer&s;al Characters legible to all rational Men.</P>
<P>Now, if the&s;e are &s;uch (as to me they &s;eem to be, notwith&s;tanding I can|not
tell the time when, or the certain Hi&s;tory how, they came to be there
di&s;po&s;ed and ordered as they are now found) then certainly it cannot be ir|rational
to conclude at lea&s;t, that there have been &s;ome precedent means
that have produced the&s;e Effects; and that tho&s;e means have been &s;uch, as we
have from Hi&s;tories and Relations within the times of our own Memory,
Experience and Information, that they have produced much the like, which
tho' they are not exactly the &s;ame, nor po&s;&s;ibly by much &s;o great and power|ful
as they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be granted, that did effect tho&s;e we now di&s;cover;
yet I think it not unrea&s;onable to conceive, that there may have been much
greater and more powerful Agents than tho&s;e we now have had, yet &s;till of
the &s;ame kind, and acted by the &s;ame Powers; for if there are now newly
&s;uch as have rai&s;ed, removed, cleft and torn Mountains, have made Lakes, fill'd
and levelled Plains, &s;topped and turned Rivers, &s;pouted out Sea-water at a
great di&s;tance from the Sea; rai&s;ed the Sea-&s;hore above the Surface of the
Sea and left it dry, with the Fi&s;h, and the remainders of them to cover the
Surface of it; at other places to rai&s;e the bottom of the Sea, which was many Fa|thoms
under Water, and place it above the Surface, and many &s;uch other
wonderful Effects; then certainly it cannot be unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that
there may have been much greater in former Times, whil&s;t the matter was
yet uncon&s;umed and di&s;pers'd up and down in more places, and more Copi|ou&s;ly,
and that more Powerful and Effective.</P>
<P>But it is Objected by &s;ome, That for &s;uch Per&s;ons, Places, or Things, of
which we find now the Relicks; we have Hi&s;tories that tell us what, who,
and when they were; whereas for the other we have no &s;uch Hi&s;tories in
being, nor during the times whereof we have any Hi&s;tories, can we find a|ny
parallel In&s;tances that can countenance &s;uch Mut$tions, Changes, and
Cata&s;trophies as are, and mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;olve the Phaenomena. <HI>Greece,
Aegyt, Italy, Spain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> have continued the &s;ame; no new Lands have
been rai&s;ed out of the Sea, much le&s;s Hills or Mountains. Be&s;ides, there
are many of tho&s;e Bodies that we now find, both Animal and Vegetable Sub&s;tances,
that are as perfectly like the Species of tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed Creatures now
is being; and therefore we are not to &s;uppo&s;e, that any Species could be ut|terly
de&s;troyed, which yet that Suppo&s;ition, &s;eems to make nece&s;&s;ary, if well
con&s;ider'd, and the Con&s;equences thereof produced.</P>
<P>To which I An&s;wer, Fir&s;t, That tho' we have no true Hi&s;tory, when, or
by whom, or by what means the <HI>Pyramids</HI> of <HI>Aegypt</HI> were built, yet all that
have &s;een them do conclude that they were built by Men, and that tho&s;e
Men were good Ma&s;ons and Architects and Engineers; and that they were
not produced of that Shape or Magnitude, by a <HI>Vegetative Power,</HI> or by a
<HI>Pla&s;tick Faculty, or by meer chance, or the accidental concurrence of Petrifactive
Atoms.</HI> Nor can I &s;ee any rea&s;on to conclude, that the va&s;t <HI>Obelisks</HI> that
have been tran&s;ported from place to place, and erected, were &s;o ordered
by Conjureing or Diabolical Magick, tho' I may not be able to tell by what
means they become &s;o ordered; I &s;hould rather be inclin'd to believe that
they were &s;o made and placed by the Indu&s;try, and Invention, of &s;ome know|ing
and ingenious Mechanick, who had &s;ome Contrivances to perform his un|dertaking
that I am ignorant of. Nor do we make it an Argument that the&s;e
<PB N="450" REF="429">
<HI>Pyramids</HI> were never made by Men, becau&s;e no Hi&s;tory does tell us when
the like have been made &s;ince. Be&s;ides, I conceive it would have been a ve|ry
ab&s;urd Conclu&s;ion, if any one &s;hould have a&s;&s;erted that tho&s;e Horns, I lately
mention'd here, were a <HI>Lu&s;us Naturae,</HI> and not the parts of any living Ani|mal,
becau&s;e he could not tell of what Creature they were; or if he &s;hould
have concluded that the Species of the Creature that produced them were
lo&s;t, becau&s;e he knew not where to find it. Certainly there are many <HI>Species</HI>
of Nature that we have never &s;een, and there may have been al&s;o many &s;uch
<HI>Species</HI> in former Ages of the World that may not be in being at pre&s;ent,
and many variations of tho&s;e <HI>Species</HI> now, which may not have had a Being in
former Times: We &s;ee what variety of <HI>Species,</HI> variety of Soils and Climates,
and other Circum&s;tantial Accidents do produce; and a <HI>Species</HI> tran&s;planted
and habituated to a new Soil, doth &s;eem to be of another kind, tho' po&s;&s;ibly it
might return again to its fir&s;t Con&s;titution, if re&s;tored to its fir&s;t former Soil.</P>
<P>But I &s;ay again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Conclu&s;ion.</NOTE> that we have, &s;ince the times wherein Hi&s;tories have been
Written, many In&s;tances of the like Changes and Cata&s;trophies, as I have &s;uppos'd
to be the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences of this Theory of Petrifaction, and &s;everal &s;o
lately, that the &s;ound of them is hardly out of our Ears; &s;o that we need not be
beholding to antient Hi&s;torians, to tell us when and where they have actually
been produced; for fir&s;t there is no place in the Earth that we do know, nor
can we indeed know any &s;uch, that is now and ever has been exempt and free
from &s;uch Mutations, as I have &s;uppo&s;ed; who can tell what part of it hath
ever been and ever will be exempt and free from Earthquakes? And tho'
Hi&s;tories &s;hould inform us that during the times of which they writ, there
had been no &s;uch Cri&s;is of Nature (which yet would be a very improbable A&s;&s;er|tion
as being a Negative) yet it were impo&s;&s;ible to be a&s;&s;ured by them, that
there had never been any before that time, nor never would be for the fu|ture.</P>
<P>And, Secondly, There is no impo&s;&s;ibility in the Suppo&s;ition that every part
hath, at &s;ome time or other, beeu &s;haken, overturned, or &s;ome way or o|ther
&s;ubject to Earthquakes, and transformed by them; and when we con&s;i|der
how great a part of the preceeding Time has been <HI>adelon,</HI> or unknown,
and unrecorded, one may ea&s;ily believe that many Changes may have hap|pened
to the Earth, of which we can have no written Hi&s;tory or Accounts.
And to me it &s;eems very ab&s;urd to conclude, that from the beginning things
have continued in the &s;ame &s;tate that we now find them, &s;ince we find every
thing to change and vary in our own remembrance; certainly 'tis a vain thing
to make Experiments and collect Ob&s;ervations, it when we have them, we
may not make u&s;e of them; if we mu&s;t not believe our Sen&s;es, if we may not
judge of things by Trials and &s;en&s;ible Proofs, if we may not be allowed to
take notice of and to make nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;ectaries and Corollaries, but mu&s;t
remain tied up to the Opinions we have received from others, and disbelieve
every thing, tho' never &s;o rational, if our received. Hi&s;tories doth not confirm
them; this will be truly <HI>Jurare in verba Magi&s;tri,</HI> and we &s;hould have no more
to do but to learn what they have thought fit to leave us: But this is contra|ry
to the <HI>Nullius in verba</HI> of this Society, and I hope that &s;en&s;ible Evidence
and Rea&s;on may at length prevail again&s;t Prejudice, and that <HI>Libertas P$ilo|&s;ophandi</HI>
may at la&s;t produce a true and real Philo&s;ophy.</P>

<P><HI>NAVIGATION</HI> is a pa&s;&s;ing from place to place upon the Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$</NOTE> by
the help of &s;ome Ve&s;&s;el; &s;o that to <HI>Navigation,</HI> the fir&s;t thing ne|ce&s;&s;ary
is the Ve&s;&s;el or Engine to Float or Swim upon the Water,
to the end that it may be moved to the Place, and by the way we
de&s;ign.</P>
<P>For this there are requi&s;ite two helps; Fir&s;t, Somewhat to move it: And,
Secondly, Somewhat to guide or direct that Motion; in the &s;upply of which
two in all particulars to the be&s;t advantage, con&s;i&s;ts the Art of <HI>Naviga|tion.</HI></P>
<P>Of the fir&s;t of the Three, namely, of the <HI>Ship,</HI> or of the Form, Structure,
or Make of the Ve&s;&s;el, much more may be &s;aid and done than has been hither|to,
but I &s;hall &s;ay nothing at this time, it being a particular Mechanical Art,
and &s;o more proper for another Occa&s;ion, where I may have Rea&s;on to treat
more largely and more particularly of it. Nor &s;hall I at all meddle now with
the Second Head, namely, concerning the ways of giving Motion to the
Ve&s;&s;el, which may be by various means performed, either by Animate or In|animate
Movers; but the mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed are either Sails by the help of
the Wind, or Oares, by the &s;trength of Men. Tho' there may be other Ways
and Means (much more Advantageous and Commodious than what are at
pre&s;ent) made u&s;e of for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, as po&s;&s;ibly I may afterwards ma|nife&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="452" REF="431">
The principal Matter I here de&s;ign to treat of, is concerning the Third
thing requi&s;ite to the Art of <HI>Navigation,</HI> and that is the way of guiding or
directing a Ship or Ve&s;&s;el, &s;o as to pa&s;s from Place to Place, or from Port to
Port the neare&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Author's chief de&s;ign in this Treati&s;e,</HI> viz. <HI>The Theo|vical part.</HI></NOTE> &s;ure&s;t, &s;afe&s;t, and &s;peedie&s;t way: In doing of which I &s;hall
not meddle with the Mechanical Part, or the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Mariner or
Steers-man, or he that guides and moves the Rudder to Kun or Steer the
Ship in this or that Cour&s;e or Rumb, that being more properly taught and
learnt at Sea by Practice; but &s;hall confine my &s;elf only to the <HI>Theorical</HI> part,
which is proper to the <HI>Pilot</HI> or <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> who directs the Steers-man, what
Cour&s;e to take, and which way to Steer the Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Things nece&s;&s;ary to be known in this part of <HI>Navigation</HI> are principally
two; Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Two things to be known.</HI></NOTE> The true Situation of places in re&s;pect of one another, and of
the interjacent Seas, both as to the <HI>Longitude</HI> and <HI>Latitude,</HI> and thence the
<HI>Rumb</HI> and <HI>Di&s;tance.</HI></P>
<P>And, Secondly, The &s;afe&s;t and neare&s;t Cour&s;e (all things con&s;idered) that
is to be kept for attaining the de&s;ired Port; for the mo&s;t direct Cour&s;e and
&s;horte&s;t di&s;tance is not always the be&s;t way, but that way which is &s;afe&s;t,
that has the be&s;t and &s;ure&s;t helps of Winds and Currents, is lea&s;t endangered
by Rocks, Shoals and Storms.</P>
<P>For both tho&s;e in part, but for the fir&s;t wholly we mu&s;t at pre&s;ent be be|holding
to the Di&s;covery and Ob&s;ervations that have been made by diligent
and inqui&s;itive Navigators, and other Arti&s;ts, who have been a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the
making and rectifying our Maps and Charts, which tho' they may labour un|der
many Errors and Imperfections, yet 'tis to be hoped that the Indu&s;try of
ingenious and skillful Arti&s;ts may much amend and rectify tho&s;e Failings, and
reduce the De&s;criptions to a much greater certainty and exactne&s;s; and in
time give us &s;uch Maps, as may be a true Picture or Repre&s;entation of the
Surface of the Earth and Sea, which is the fir&s;t principal thing. I need not
In&s;tance in the great Errors that are to be found in our pre&s;ent Maps, nor
in the Di&s;crepancy they have one with another;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Errors in the pre&s;ent Sea Chartes.</NOTE> &s;ince none that has been a|ny
way conver&s;ant in them can be ignorant thereof: However &s;uch as they
are we mu&s;t be content to make u&s;e of them, 'till by the collected Ob&s;erva|tions
of &s;ome that have already communicated their Knowledge, and others
that may for the future labour in this Work, there be a compleater &s;et of
Mapps and Charts Graved and Publi&s;hed a-new for the Benefit of Mankind.
For the doing of which I could &s;ugge&s;t many things that would very much
improve their u&s;efulne&s;s, both as to <HI>Geography,</HI> and <HI>Hydrography,</HI> or <HI>Navigati|on;</HI>
of which I &s;hall &s;ay more hereafter upon another occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Secondly, The other part is partly Theorical, and party Hi&s;torical.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;torical Part con&s;i&s;ts in the Relations of Voyages that have been, or
are now made to any known Part, wherein we may find an account or
what Cour&s;e they have hitherto ob&s;erved to be the be&s;t to be kept from place
to place, what Sea&s;ons of the Year, what Currents are to be met with, and
at what times; what Winds blow at certain Places and Sea&s;ons, what &s;afe
and convenient Harbours lie in the way for Victualling, Watering, Careen|ing,
and the like: What Sands, Rocks, Shoals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are to be avoided;
what variation they have found of the Compa&s;s at this or that part of their
Cour&s;e, or Ports they have touched at, and at what times they were ob&s;erved
becau&s;e of the continual Variation of the Variation; what ligns they have of
en&s;uing Storms, and what methods they have u&s;ed to &s;ecure them&s;elves; and
many other of the like Nature&mdash;. And it were much to be de&s;ired that the
Journals and Ob&s;ervations of all Navigators were in &s;ome certain place re|tained
and pre&s;erved,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The u&s;e of Journals</HI></NOTE> that Recour&s;e might thereto be had for extracting and
methodizing all &s;uch Ob&s;ervations into a compleat Hi&s;tory of &s;uch particular
Voyages, and for the compleating a general Theory. For tho' many con&s;i|derable
things are Known to divers skillful Navigators to tho&s;e parts, partly
from their own Ob&s;ervations, and partly from the informations they have
had from others, yet a very great number of Ob&s;ervations and Methods, that
have been formerly and lately known and ob&s;erved by divers others, have
been lo&s;t and forgotten, and are not now to be found. And to &s;peak of
Arti&s;ts now living, 'tis to be feared that even tho&s;e things which they them|&s;elves
<PB N="453" REF="432">
know, when they Die, will be lo&s;t, and others that &s;hall follow them,
will be fain to begin upon a new &s;core with their own Ob&s;ervations; &s;everal
of tho&s;e may po&s;&s;ibly be handed from one to another by Di&s;cour&s;e and oral
Tradition; but that at be&s;t mu&s;t needs be very imperfect, &s;ince we find that
Men them&s;elves forget in a little time their own Ob&s;ervations, and this or
that particular Circum&s;tance will &s;lip out of their Memory, e&s;pecially in mat|ters
of number; and certainly there could be no better way to pre&s;erve them
for future U&s;e, than by trea&s;uring them up in &s;ome one certain place, where
they might be &s;afely pre&s;erved: And it were as much for the ob&s;ervers In|tere&s;t.
&s;o to do, &s;ince it would put him upon ob&s;erving as well as upon writ|ing
his Ob&s;ervations, and 'twould prompt him to recollect things taken no|tice
of, whil&s;t the impre&s;&s;ions of them are yet fre&s;h in his Memory, by which
means he would not only fix them more la&s;tingly in his own Memory; but it
would be an occa&s;ion to him of making. his Ob&s;ervations much more certain
and determinate, and of minding many other con&s;iderable Circum&s;tances,
which he would otherwi&s;e not at all have regarded; as any one that makes
trial will ea&s;ily be convinced of; this therefore, we hope, Time may pro|duce.</P>
<P>The Theorical Part, which is that I aim principally to Di&s;cour&s;e of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Theor$word$ part.</NOTE> is a
knowledge or Art, by which Directions are obtained for Guiding and Steer|ing
a Ve&s;&s;el from any one place to any other, whereof we have the Situation
given and all the material Circum&s;tances, that have been taken notice of to
be u&s;ually met with in, Voyages made to tho&s;e Parts; for 'tis with Voyages at
Sea oftentimes as it is in Journies upon the Land, that the farthe&s;t way about is
oft times the neare&s;t way thither: The cau&s;e of which, in Sea Voyages, is to
be a&s;cribed either to the Winds or to the Currents and Tides; of which I
&s;hall &s;ay more hereafter. And tho' the general Theory would direct you to
Sail or Steer by the &s;horte&s;t and &s;traighte&s;t way through the open and free
Sea from one place to another, yet the intervening of the&s;e and &s;ome other
Circum&s;tances do make you take a very differing Cour&s;e, and go &s;ometimes
this way, and &s;ometimes that way, for the better attaining your end. As
when they Sail to the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> they do not Steer on the direct Rumb that
leads thither, but Sail a-way more towards the South, that they may get in|to
the Trade or Ea&s;terly Winds, which may carry them from thence more
directly and &s;peedily towards their Port; whereas in the direct Rumb they
meet with Calms or contrary Winds and Currents, which would take up
much more Time, and cau&s;e much greater inconvenience; 'tis plain there|fore,
that both the&s;e parts are nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>viz.</HI> Fir&s;t, True Charts of the Si|tuition
of Places: And, Secondly, A true Hi&s;tory of the Conveniences and
Inconveniences of pa&s;&s;ing by this or that Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t of the&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">For knowing the Situatier of piaces.</NOTE> namely, for the knowing of the true Situation of
Places to one another, it is requi&s;ite to under&s;tand, Fir&s;t, the Figure of the
Body of the Earth: And, Secondly, The Magnitude. Concerning the Fi|gure
of the Earth; there have been very many, and tho&s;e very differing O|pinions
among the ancient Philo&s;ophers, but whether their Opinions are tru|ly
related to us, or whether they had any Grounds or Rea&s;ons for tho&s;e O|pinions
we are uncertain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Terra|queous Figure, the Opinions of the Antients.</NOTE> becau&s;e little is &s;aid concerning them. <HI>Anaximan|der</HI>
is &s;aid to have &s;uppo&s;ed it like a Column; tho' yet con&s;dering his skill in
A&s;tronomy, 'tis hardly to be believed. <HI>Leucippus</HI> like a Cylinder or Drum.
<HI>Cleanthes</HI> like a top or double Cone, who&s;e Points were at the Poles as &s;ome
&s;ay; but others, that he &s;uppo&s;ed it like a Di&s;h, hollowed in the middle, but
ri&s;ing towards the Edges, that the Sea might not run over, of which Opini|on
<HI>Heraclitus</HI> is al&s;o &s;aid to be. <HI>Anaximenes</HI> and <HI>Empedocles</HI> are &s;aid to have
&s;uppo&s;ed it like a round Table, or a round Plain, being the top, as it. were,
of a mighty Cylinder or Column, for the bottom of which, they a&s;&s;igned no
bounds; of which <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his Book <HI>De Caelo,</HI> and <HI>Plutarch De Placitis Phi|lo&s;ophorum</HI>
give an account. Of this Opinion are mo&s;t Men who are ignorant
in A&s;tronomy and Geography, and that becau&s;e the vi&s;ible appearance, they
always have of the Earth, is a very large Plain covered with the Heavens as
with a Hemi&s;phere, and becau&s;e the Land was always bounded by the Sea,
and that the Limits or Bounds of that Sea was not known, it was &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="454" REF="433">
that the Sea was bounded by the hollow Hemi&s;phere of Heaven, and thence
that the Sun, Moon and Stars that Ro&s;e and Set, did ri&s;e out of the Sea,
and &s;et or de&s;cend again into the Sea, which was the occa&s;ion and ground of
tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions and Fables of the antient Poets; and even to this day igno|rant
People, that have been no better informed, are from the &s;ame Cau&s;e, as
I have already mention'd of the &s;ame Opinion; for this cau&s;e al&s;o it was,
that &s;ome were of Opinion, that <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or the whole of the World was Wa|ter,
and that there was a kind of Arch or Firmament of Heaven, which
kept off the Waters that were above this Arch from coming to the Waters
which were beneath the Arch, upon which the Earth floated, as it were a
Di&s;h; and that beneath the Earth that kept up the Waters above, was the
&s;pace, wherein the Air and Meteors were placed&mdash;. This al&s;o was much
countenanced by the vi&s;ible appearances both of the Earth and the Heavens,
and &s;o needs not much of Arguments to make it pa&s;s with the Vulgar and Il|literate,
and &s;uch as have not been u&s;ed to con&s;ider and rea&s;on about the&s;e
Matters. Hence comes it, that even to this Day, we may every where find
People who retain as ab&s;urd Imaginations, and who &s;till look upon Antipo|des
as impo&s;&s;ible Fictions, and the Product only of the Authority of Sea|men
and Travellers to tell &s;trange things; nor has it been only the Opinion
of the Vulgar and Illiterate, but even of many otherwi&s;e very Learned and
Excellent Men, &s;uch as were &s;everal Fathers of the Church, who, from their
want of this &s;ort of Knowledge, and from their mi&s;under&s;tanding &s;ome Texts
of the Scripture, have zealou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the Opinion of the roundne&s;s of the
Earth and of Antipodes.</P>
<P><HI>Parmenides,</HI> among the Antients, is &s;aid by <HI>Diogenes Laertius,</HI> to be the fir&s;t
that ever a&s;&s;erted the Earth to be a round Ball or Globe, and &s;eated In the
middle of the World, and the fir&s;t, that &s;et out or limited the habitable Parts
of the World, and bounded them by the Frozen <HI>Zone</HI> on the one &s;ide, and
the Torrid or Burning <HI>Zone</HI> one the other &s;ide, as is related of him by <HI>Plu|tarch</HI>
in his Treati&s;e <HI>De placitis Philo&s;ophorum:</HI> This Man flouri&s;hed in the &s;ix|ty
nineth <HI>Olympiad,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of an antient learned Age.</NOTE> that is, about five Hundred Years before <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> But tho'
this Per&s;on were an extraordinary Philo&s;opher and great di&s;coverer of Na|ture,
and &s;o might po&s;&s;ibly receive this Opinion, yet we find by the fore-men|tioned
Book of <HI>Plutarch,</HI> that this Opinion is a&s;cribed to <HI>Thales,</HI> who lived a|bove
a Hundred Years &s;ooner; and if we had not been defective in the Hi|&s;tory
of antient Times, without doubt we &s;hould have been informed that
A&s;tronomy and the Theory of the World, revived by <HI>Copernicus,</HI> was, long
before <HI>Thales,</HI> well known, and if &s;o, then the roundne&s;s of the Body of the
Earth could not be a thing unknown to &s;o learned an Age; of which learn|ed
Age, beyond all the Hi&s;tories now to be met with, <HI>Hugo Grotius</HI> has given
us a Collection of <HI>Te&s;timonies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Simplicius</HI> in his Notes upon <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> mentions, that <HI>Cali&s;thenes</HI> (who upon
the taking of <HI>Babylon</HI> was pre&s;ented by <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> to <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great) had
&s;everal very antient Writings of A&s;tronomers very long before that time,
namely, of 1903 Years, which, according to the common Account, mu&s;t fall
about three&s;core Years after the Flood, and con&s;equently, if A&s;tronomy were
&s;o early &s;o well known, the Figure of the Earth could not be unknown; for
whatever &s;trange Opinions &s;ome of the Philo&s;ophers might have, who had on|ly
contemplated &s;ome of the le&s;&s;er Bodies and Productions of Nature which
were within their reach, yet mo&s;t certainly tho&s;e that were skillful in A&s;tro|nomy
could not be ignorant of its Form, which we may plainly enough
prove from their a&s;&s;igning the Eclip&s;es of the Moon to be from the &s;hadow
of the Earth; but e&s;pecially if the Sy&s;tem of <HI>Ari&s;tarchus</HI> were &s;o very anti|ent,
wherein the Earth is &s;uppo&s;ed a Planet.</P>
<P>But to omit any further mention of the Opinions or Theories of the Anti|ents concerning the Figure of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Sphaeri|cal Figurr of the Earth.</NOTE> it is now &s;uppo&s;ed or granted by
all Philo&s;ophers, A&s;tronomers, and Geographers, that the Figure of the Bo|dy
of the Earth is Globular, or every way equally round, or of a Sphaerical
Figure, and accordingly the Model of it is commonly made of that Figure, a
Globe, and the Parts or places of it are &s;et down and de&s;cribed upon the
Superficies of a perfect Globe, and &s;o the di&s;tances from place to place are
<PB N="455" REF="434">
computed as upon &s;uch a Sphaerical or bending Surface; and many Arguments
are commonly brought to prove this Opinion, which, becau&s;e they are to be
met with in almo&s;t every Geographical Writer, I &s;hall pa&s;s by at pre&s;ent;
&s;ome only I would here take notice of, that tho' it be &s;o generally a&s;&s;ented to,
and concluded by all, yet I conceive there is no one po&s;itive and undeniable
Proof to evince it again&s;t &s;ome I have lately met with, who would have it to
be &s;omewhat of an Oval or Egg-like Figure, the Axis of its motion being
&s;uppo&s;ed the longe&s;t Diameter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Oval Fi|gure thereof.</NOTE> or of another, who &s;uppo&s;es it may be of an
Oval Figure the contrary way, and that the longe&s;t Diameter of it is the Ae|quinoctial,
and the &s;horte&s;t the Axis; the rea&s;on of the fir&s;t was alledged to
be, for that the Sun does exhale and draw up into the Air from the parts of the
<HI>Torrid Zone</HI> a great quantity of Water and other volatile Materials from it
into the Air, and drive them towards the two Polar Parts, where they again
praecipitate and falldown in Rain, Snows, Hails, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;o turn to Ice, and
&s;o rai&s;e the parts thereof towards the Pole, and dimini&s;h the parts about the
<HI>Torrid Zone:</HI> But the An&s;wer to this Argument is very ca&s;y, that if the
Water be mo&s;t rai&s;ed within the <HI>Torrid Zone</HI> and rain'd down again in the Fri|gid,
then it would follow, that there mu&s;t be a continual pa&s;&s;age of Water
from the Frigid towards the Torrid, and po&s;&s;ibly it mu&s;t carry more parts a|long
with it in its return towards the Aequinoctial in the Form of Water, than
from the <HI>Torrid Zone</HI> back to the Frigid in the form of Air: This therefore
will be a better Argument for the &s;econd Hypothe&s;is than for the fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the Au|thor mentions here of the O|v$l Figure, is more largely $e $ed of and demon&s;trated Page 355. Supra.</NOTE> but
'tis judged no po&s;itive and certain Argument for either, &s;ince what it carries
back towards the Aequinoctial, &s;erves only to fill up the Caverns in the bot|tom
of the Sea: The Argument alledged for the &s;econd Opinion, was, that
the Globe of the Earth being whirled round upon its Axis, the parts near
the Aequinoctial have le&s;s Gravity than the Parts near the Poles; but tho'
this be more &s;ignificant than the former, yet it may be &s;aid that the Body of
the Sun, tho' it be moved upon its Axis as well as the Body of the Earth, yet
the Figure thereof, as far as we can di&s;cover by the Tele&s;cope, is &s;till per|fectly
round. Now the proportion of the Diameter of the Sun to the Dia|meter
of the Earth being greater than the period of the Sun's Revolution to
the Period of the Earth's; it follows that the parts of the Sun move &s;wifter
than the re&s;pective parts of the Body of the Earth. Now, tho' it be alledg|ed
that the Body of <HI>Mercury</HI> pa&s;&s;ing through the Body of the Sun in the la&s;t
Conjunction ob&s;erved by Montieur <HI>Gallet,</HI> was by him &s;aid to appear of this
Figure, yet no &s;uch appearance was taken notice of by others that ob&s;erved
the &s;ame; and if it had, 'tis not yet known whether <HI>Mercury</HI> be moved round
upon its Axis or not, and therefore no certain conclu&s;ion can thence be de|duced
But as neither of the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions is &s;ufficiently proved, &s;o I mu&s;t
needs &s;ay that the ab&s;olute round ne&s;s of the Ball of the Earth does yet want a
po&s;itive Proof; for no one of the Arguments or Experiments, yet brought to
prove that Figure, are &s;ufficiently exact and po&s;itive to prove it; for tho'
they do mo&s;t of them prove it to have a Figure which is near a round, yet
they do not prove it ab&s;olutely; for Fir&s;t, It cannot certainly enough be di&s;|covered
by the Eclip&s;es of the Moon; for the &s;hadow may be &s;omewhat El|liptical
either way, and yet the appearances not &s;ufficient to determine the
difference; for we find that no Ob&s;ervation hitherto made doth exactly agree
with any Calculation yet made; and to what to a&s;cribe the difference is not
hitherto agreed. Next, none of the mea&s;ures of a Degree, tho' &s;ome of them,
as particularly that of the <HI>French</HI> lately Publi&s;hed by the <HI>Royal Academy,</HI> are
made with great exactne&s;s, for each of them only &s;hew what mea&s;ure was
found of a Degree of the Meridian in that Latitude; but they differ enough
one from another to &s;hew that no two of them compared together will be
&s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e. Further, tho' two of them &s;hould pretty
near agree, as that of Mr. <HI>Norwood</HI> here in <HI>England,</HI> and that of Mr. <HI>Picart,</HI>
yet to make them &s;ignificant for this purpo&s;e, the &s;ame examinations &s;hould
have been made Ea&s;tward and We&s;twards, to &s;ee whether the Parallels Would
have an&s;wered to the re&s;pective Latitudes; and therefore if the&s;e Proofs be
not &s;ufficient, much le&s;s will the Ob&s;ervation of Seamen, who&s;e computations
of Leagues failed, are by no means accurate enough to determine this mat|ter;
<PB N="456" REF="435">
for there may be a con&s;iderable difference, and yet they unable to detect
it.</P>
<P>Again&s;t this the mo&s;t material Objection is, that if the Body of the Earth
&s;hould be Elliptical,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Objection a|gain&s;t the El|liptical Figure.</NOTE> as there is &s;ome probability that it is &s;o, not with the
longe&s;t Diameter in the Axis, which would make it of an Egg form, but
with the longe&s;t Diameter, in the plain of the Aequinoctial, which would make
it of a Turnep or Bowl Form, and that becau&s;e the Rotation thereof mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily make the parts of the Earth, which are carried the &s;wifte&s;t with
that motion, have an indeavour outwards, or from the Axis of Rotation, as
we find in all Bodies moved with &s;uch a motion; which indeavour mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily
take off from the Gavitation of tho&s;e Bodies towards the Center, and
thence if the power of Gravitation be every ways from the Center equally
forcing towards the Center, the parts of the Earth towards the Aequinoctial
mu&s;t have le&s;s Gravity than the parts of the Earth that are nearer the Poles;
and con&s;equently there mu&s;t be a longer Cone or Cylinder near the Aequi|noctial
to counterpoi&s;e a &s;horter near the Poles, and con&s;equently to keep the
Water of the Sea in a Counterpoi&s;e, there mu&s;t be a ri&s;ing of the Sea above
the Sphaerical Surface near the
Aequinoctial, and a depre&s;&s;ion of the Sea below
that Sphaerical Surface near the Poles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From the point|ing of the $$|pendicular.</NOTE> which makes it of this Turnep or Bowl
&s;hape. Again&s;t this, I &s;ay, the greate&s;t Objection is this, either the Perpen|dicular
doth point directly to the Center of the Earth, or it doth not: If
it be a&s;&s;erted that it points directly to the Center of the Earth, then the
Surface or the vi&s;ible Horizon would di&s;cover &s;uch a variation from perfect
Sphaericalne&s;s by an obliquity of its plain to the Plumb Line, which then would
not be Perpendicular to it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An&s;wered.</NOTE> To which I An&s;wer, that this Obliquity being
but little, it would not ea&s;ily be di&s;covered by rea&s;on of the Refraction of
the Air near the Horizon, yet if it really be &s;o, I grant it may with great
care be found, if a place convenient for &s;uch an Ob&s;ervation, and the Expe|riment
be purpo&s;ely and with great care made, as at &s;ome promontory of Land
running Ea&s;tward or We&s;tward into the Sea, where the Surface of the Sea or
the Horizon thereof may be &s;een both to the North and to the South. But
this I do not find has ever yet been ob&s;erved as it ought to be, and therefore
there may be &s;uch an appearance, and yet not hitherto detected. But, Se|condly,
If it be a&s;&s;erted that if the Plumb-Line do not point to the Center,
then this would be di&s;covered by the different account of Leagues failed Ea&s;t
and We&s;t, from the Leagues failed North and South, to an&s;wer to a Degree,
or by the differing length or a Degree in differing Latitudes; to which I An|&s;wer,
that I do confe&s;s that there would be really &s;uch a difference, but yet I
&s;ay no Ob&s;ervation hitherto made could detect it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Accurate Ob|&s;ervations are yet wanting.</NOTE> there are wanting therefore
many Ob&s;ervations nece&s;&s;ary for the verifying and po&s;itively demon&s;trating this
Que&s;tion, which, tho' it has &s;care been ever yet mentioned by any Writer,
yet I judge it may be well worth the while to have it exactly tried and exa|mined;
for tho' it hath been generally believed and a&s;&s;erted, that the Fi|gure
of the Earth is exactly Sphaerical or Globular, yet I a&s;&s;ert that there is
not one, that I have ever yet met with, that has proved or demon&s;trated it &s;o
to be; and to me it &s;eems very probable from &s;ome Phy&s;ical Con&s;iderations,
that it may be con&s;iderably otherwi&s;e; of which I have di&s;cour&s;ed much more
largely on another Subject, wherein I have &s;hewn the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equences,
and the &s;everal Proprieties thereof, which are much differing from the No|tions
hitherto commonly received.</P>
<P>However probable it is, that 'tis pretty near the Sphaerical Figure, and
therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earth pretty nearly of a Sphaerical Figure.</NOTE> 'till it be &s;ome ways found to be otherwi&s;e, the computation of di|&s;tances
may be &s;o made as if it had been po&s;itively proved &s;o to be, and the
mea&s;ures of di&s;tances made accordingly; which brings me to the &s;econd nece&s;|&s;ary
to be known, and that is the true Magnitude of the Body of the Earth
compared to the common known mea&s;ures, as that of a Foot, Pace, Fathom,
Stadium, Mile, League, or the like.</P>
<P>For this then we have an account of very many Experiments and Trials
that have been made both heretofore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mea&s;$$ of a Degree a$|t$mpted by &s;e|veral of the Antients and Modern$.</NOTE> and of later Days; but if we compare
them together, one would be apt to imagine, either that they were very im|perfectly
made, or el&s;e that we are very ignorant of their &s;everal particular
<PB N="457" REF="436">
mea&s;ures, or el&s;e that there may be a real difference of the mea&s;ure of a De|gree
taken at &s;everal Latitudes of the Earth; for <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> makes it 1111 Sta|dia,
<HI>Erato&s;thenes</HI> 700, <HI>Po&s;&s;idonius</HI> 666, and <HI>Ptolomy</HI> 500, and the <HI>Arabians</HI> yet
le&s;s; but in truth we know not what ways they took for exactne&s;s, nor what
mea&s;ure any of them made u&s;e of compared with tho&s;e in u&s;e at pre&s;ent a|mong
us; and therefore it will be much le&s;s difficult not to err our &s;elves, than
to know whether the Antients err'd or no.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the Modern Experiments for this purpo&s;e, we may find that
Mr. <HI>Norwood</HI> in the Year 1635, did find the Meridian Altitude of the Sun
on the eleventh of <HI>June</HI> to be 59, 33#, and that two Years before that, <HI>viz.</HI> on
the eleventh of <HI>June</HI> 1633, he had found the Meridian Altitude of the Sun at
<HI>London</HI> 62&deg; 01#, whence he concludes (not making any allowance for declina|tion,
Refraction, or Parallax) that <HI>York</HI> was more <HI>North</HI> than <HI>London</HI> 2, 28.
Now by mea&s;uring the di&s;tance by Chains of ninty nine Foot long, or &s;ix Rod
of 16 &frac12; to a Rod, he found it to be 9149 Chains, or 905751 Feet; whence
he concludes in a Degree there are 367196 or 367200 Feet, which is &s;ixty nine
Miles and an half and 236 Feet, whence there will be 6120 Feet in one Mi|nute
or a gradual Mile, which is 840 Foot more than our Statute Mile which
is 5280 Foot.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Experiment that has been made for determining this mea&s;ure, is
that of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Picart,</HI> and the Gentlemen of the <HI>Royal Academy of Paris,</HI> who
with great exactne&s;s of In&s;truments and great Skill and Care in performing,
examin'd the mea&s;ure of a Degree and found the &s;ame to be 57060 Toi&s;es or
Fathoms of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Paris,</HI> each Fathom or Toi&s;e containing &s;ix Pari&s;ian
Feet, and thence a Degree contains 342360 Pari&s;ian Feet; and the Pari&s;ian
Foot being to that of <HI>London</HI> as 16 to 15, a Degree will contain 365184 <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>
Feet, or 69 Miles and 864 Feet; which is almo&s;t 1/6 part of a Mile, a
&s;ixth part of a Mile being 880 Feet, &s;o that by this Account a Degree is le&s;s
than what Mr. <HI>Norwood</HI> makes it by 2012 Feet, and con&s;equently a Minute
or gradual Mile will contain 6086 1/5 Feet, which is longer than a Statute
Mile 806 2/5 Foot, which is almo&s;t a Sixth, <HI>viz.</HI> 880. Now having the mea|&s;ure
of one Degree, it will be ea&s;y to find the mea&s;ure of the Circumference
of the whole Earth, there being 360 &s;uch Degrees in a great Circle of it. 360
times 365184 gives 13156624$ Feet in the Circumference of the Earth, or
24915 Miles and 5$4 Feet.</P>
<P>The&s;e two la&s;t Men&s;urations are le&s;s than that which was made by the
<HI>Arabians</HI> about the Year of our Lord 827 by &s;everal skilful Mathematicians
at the command of <HI>Almaiman</HI> an <HI>Arabian</HI> Prince, in the Plains of <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI>
they finding a mea&s;ure of a Degree, which, reduced to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mea&s;ure,
amounted to 370222 Feet; &s;o that That of Mr. <HI>Norwood</HI> is le&s;s by 3022 Feet,
and that of Mr. <HI>Picart</HI> 5238; &s;o that <HI>Norwood</HI> is le&s;s by about 1 1/2$ part of a
Degree, or about half a Minute, and <HI>Picart</HI> is le&s;s by a 72 1/2 part of a Degree,
or almo&s;t an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mile.</P>
<P>What to a&s;cribe the Rea&s;on of the&s;e differences one from another to, is pret|ty
hard to &s;ay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To what their Di&s;crepancy may be a&s;crib'd and of the dif|ference of mea|&s;ures.</NOTE> but mo&s;t probably it is partly the differing method each of
them took, and partly al&s;o the uncertainty of the comparative Magnitude of
the mea&s;ures they each of them made u&s;e of; for to go no farther back than
Mr. <HI>Norwood,</HI> we are not well a&s;&s;ured but that the Foot he made u&s;e of was
le&s;s than the Foot we now make u&s;e of by 181 1/2 part by which he differs from <HI>Pi|cart,</HI>
which is about half a Cente&s;m; for the Standard Foot we now u&s;e was &s;ince
that time agreed upon by a Club of our Mathematical In&s;trument-makers, of
whom Mr. <HI>Elias Allen</HI> was the chief; we will not now mention any other
cau&s;e, tho' po&s;&s;ibly there may be another more con&s;iderable than either But
not to trouble our &s;elves with what the mea&s;ure of a Degree has been, 'tis on|ly
nece&s;&s;ary for our pre&s;ent Enquiry to know what really it is now, reduced
to a known and certain and invariable mea&s;ure, in which all Nations may a|gree;
for 'till that be done,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Logline at pre&s;ent leads, into errors.</NOTE> our mea&s;uring the Cour&s;e at Sea by the Logline
is fal&s;e and leads into great Errors and Mi&s;takes; for if with the Logline
we mea&s;ure a League, or the 60th part of a Degree, and account it to hold
but 15840 Foot, or 2640 Fathom, and it really contains 18259 1/5 Feet, or 3043
Fathoms, then the Cour&s;e mea&s;ured by &s;uch an erroneous mea&s;ure mu&s;t needs
very much confound our reckoning</P>
<P><PB N="458" REF="437">
It will be nece&s;&s;ary therefore in the fir&s;t place to rectify our mea&s;ure and the length of our Line.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of an univer|&s;al standard for mea&s;ure.</NOTE></P>
<P>Many have been the attempts and de&s;igns both of Antient and Moderns
to perform this nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Praecognitum</HI> to Geography and Mechanicks;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st. The Pen|dulum propos'd for that end.</NOTE> but to
this Day it remains a thing to be &s;ought after. The la&s;t and be&s;t way hi|therto
thought of is, that by the length of a <HI>Pendulum</HI> vibrating Seconds of
Time mea&s;ured by the Sun's middle motion in the Ecliptick, reduced to the
Aequinoctial or right a a&s;cen&s;um, which, for ought I know, was fir&s;t invent|ed
by the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> tho' it has been &s;ince publi&s;hed by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Hugens,</HI>
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Picart,</HI> and divers others. Or which were yet more ea&s;y to be found
and more certain, by rea&s;on that the Sun's true <HI>Anomaly</HI> is not yet a&s;certain|ed
by the length of a <HI>Pendulum</HI> vibrating a Second of Time, by the diurnal Re|volution
of &s;ome notable fixt Star; becau&s;e, in all probability, that is always e|qual
and the &s;ame at any time of the Year, and in any Year, either pa&s;t or to
come. And tho' the ingenious <HI>Kepler</HI> has from his Hypothe&s;is of the-turbi|nating
Power of Light &s;uppo&s;ed that the turbinating or diurnal Motion of
the Earth upon its Axis is accelerated and retarded in that diurnal Rotation,
according as it moves nearer to, or further off from the Sun; yet there is no
one certain and po&s;itive Experiment or Ob&s;ervation yet brought to prove
any &s;uch inequality; and from another Hypothe&s;is which I have of the cau&s;es
of that motion, which is very differing from that of <HI>Kepler,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e there
can be none &s;uch, and therefore 'till by &s;ome certain Ob&s;ervation, it be found
to be otherwi&s;e, we may, with great Rea&s;on, &s;uppo&s;e it to be at all times of
the Year, the &s;ame; &s;o that if a <HI>Pendulum</HI> be made of &s;uch a length as to
make 86400 &s;ingle vibrations in the time that any fixt Star pa&s;&s;es from the
Meridian, 'till it return to the &s;ame the next Night, that length may be ta|ken
for a perpetual mea&s;ure of length or a Standard Yard, to which all o|ther
mea&s;ures of Length, Breadth, Solidity, Capacity, Weight, or Power,
may be reduc'd; and &frac13; of that may be taken for the univer&s;al Foot, and two
of tho&s;e for an univer&s;al Fathom, and five of tho&s;e may make a Rod or Pole;
or which were yet better, to divide this length into ten, for Decimals or
Hands, and each of tho&s;e into Decimals which may be called Digits or Fin|gers,
and each of the&s;e into Decimals which may be called Threads, and
each of the&s;e into Decimals which may be called Clews or Hairs, and &s;o on|ward
by Decimal-&s;ubdivi&s;ion, to continue downwards, &s;o as you have occa|&s;ion,
of a &s;maller or &s;maller mea&s;ure, which may be call'd Tenths, Hun|dreds,
Thou&s;ands, ten Thou&s;ands, hundred Thou&s;ands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and for grea|ter
mea&s;ures to compute only by the number of &s;uch Yards, Arms, or
Paces.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Hugens</HI> has determined the length of a <HI>Pendulum</HI> vibrating Se|conds
by the Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The length of a Pendulum vibrating Se|conds.</NOTE> to be three Foot 8 1/6 Lines of the <HI>Pari&s;ian</HI> mea&s;ure, account|ing
the Limits of his mea&s;ure &s;o taken, to be from the Center of Su&s;pen&s;ion, to
the Center of O&s;cillation or Vibration, which is a Point to be found by a pro|portion
which he a&s;&s;igns, depending on the length of the Diameter of the
Ball to the length of the String by which it is &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>The Toi&s;e or Fathom of the Ob&s;ervations of <HI>Paris,</HI> which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Picart</HI>
made u&s;e of for the mea&s;ure of a Degree, was, according to the la&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
at <HI>Paris,</HI> compared with the Standard of the length of a <HI>Pendulum</HI> vi|brating
Seconds of Time conformable to the mean motion of the Sun.</P>
<P>The Toi&s;e contains &s;ix Pari&s;ian Feet, and the Pari&s;ian Foot to the <HI>London</HI>
Foot is in proportion as 16 to 15.&mdash;Each of the&s;e Pari&s;ian Feet is divided
into Duodecimals or Inches, and each Inch into Duodecimals or Lines.</P>
<P>Now, by many trials, he found the length of &s;uch a <HI>Pendulum</HI> to be thirty
&s;ix Inches, and eight Lines and an half.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pendulum</HI> he u&s;ed, as he him&s;elf declares, was made of a Ball of Copper
of one Inch in Diameter exactly turned, and the fir&s;t String, he u&s;ed to &s;u&s;|pend
it by, was of a flat Silk. The length of the <HI>Pendulum</HI> he reckons to be from
the Center of Motion to the Center of the Ball, omitting the part proporti|onal
taken notice of by Mou&s;ieur <HI>Hugeus,</HI> the Ball being but a thirty &s;ixth part
of the length of the Thread; otherwi&s;e if the Ball be bigger, the proportional
part mu&s;t be taken notice of as making a con&s;iderable variation, the vibrati|ons
<PB N="459" REF="438">
al&s;o ob&s;erv'd were very &s;hort, otherwi&s;e there would have been a con&s;i|derable
variation in their Duration or Time, but afterwards finding that the
Silk was apt to &s;hrink and &s;tretch by the lea&s;t drine&s;s and moi&s;ture of the Air,
it was found much better for that purpo&s;e to make u&s;e of a flake of Silk
Gra&s;s, which is a &s;ort of long and very fine Flax brought out of <HI>America,</HI>
which is very flexible and yet very &s;trong, and not &s;ubject to &s;hrink or &s;tretch.
The upper end of this Flake was put between the Chops of a &s;mall Vice which
held it very firm when pinched by the Screw, and the length was mea&s;ured
by a &s;mall Rod of Iron made exactly of the length of the String, when the Ball
hung Perpendicular between the Head of the &s;aid Vice and the Ball.</P>
<P>This <HI>Pendulum</HI> was adju&s;ted by two large <HI>Pendulum-Clocks,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Pendulum</HI>
had been by trials adju&s;ted to move Second Minutes by the mean motion of
the Sun, and which were found &s;lower by three Minutes and fifty &s;ix Seconds,
at every return of the &s;ame Star to the Meridian; and that to &s;uch an ex|actne&s;s,
that they differed not one from another, one &s;ingle Second during
many Days; the Single <HI>Pendulum</HI> was &s;o &s;u&s;pended and put into motion, that
it vibrated the &s;ame way as the <HI>Pendulum</HI> of the Clock; and if it were of 36
Inches eight and an half Lines, it continued its Vibrations the &s;ame with tho&s;e
of the Clock, but if it were never &s;o little either longer or &s;horter than that
mea&s;ure, it became, in le&s;s than an Hours time, &s;en&s;ibly differing; however
he acknowledged that this length was not always found &s;o preci&s;e, but that
it &s;eemed it ought to have been a little &s;hortned in Winter and lengthned in
Summer; but that, he conceives, ought to have been but the tenth part of a
Line, and the exce&s;s on both &s;ides being pretty near equal, he therefore made
choice of the length of 36 Inches, eight and an half Lines, as the medium or
middle length between that of the Summer and that of the Winter.</P>
<P>Now, if this were made the general Standard for the mea&s;ures of all Coun|tries,
or that there particular mea&s;ures, whatever they be, were reduced to
this, then the knowing the proportion thev bear to the Standard would ma|nife&s;t
the proportions they have to one another, and &s;o the mea&s;ures given of
a Degree in one place, by the mea&s;ures of that Country might ea&s;ily be re|duced
to the mea&s;ures of any other; and &s;o Experiments truly made might
be as accurately examin'd and compar'd together.</P>
<P>But again&s;t this way of finding a natural,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Objections a|gain&s;t this Standard.</NOTE> univer&s;al, and perpetual Stand|ard
mea&s;ure of length there may be divers Objections not incon&s;iderable;
as, Fir&s;t, That if the Gravitating Power of the Earth be greater in one place
than in the other, as towards the Poles more than towards the Aequator,
then the length of a <HI>Pendulum</HI> to vibrate Seconds, mu&s;t al&s;o be con&s;iderably
longer towards the Poles than towards the Aequinoctial, otherwi&s;e the <HI>Pen|dulum</HI>
of the &s;ame length with what is determin'd in <HI>France,</HI> which is about the
middle between the North Pole and the Aequinoctial, will go too quick near
the Poles, and too &s;low near the Aequinoctial. Now, what I many Years
&s;ince di&s;cover'd in this place, reading about Penduls for Longitude, and what
I have now before mention'd concerning a probability, if not a nece&s;&s;ity of
&s;uch an inequality of Gravitation, and cou&s;equently of a Boul-like form of
the Earth, does at lea&s;t hint that &s;ome Experiment of that kind ought to be
try'd at &s;ome place near the Aequator, to &s;ee whether it be &s;o or not, and 'till
that be done there can be no certain Conclu&s;ion made thereupon.</P>
<P>Next, 'tis not impo&s;&s;ible but that the Gravity or attractive Power of the
Earth may be at &s;ome times greater than at others;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gravity may differ in the &s;ame place.</NOTE> for we &s;ee that there is
hardly any thing in Nature that &s;tands at a certain &s;tay, but does &s;ometimes
increa&s;e and &s;ometimes dimini&s;h; and if &s;o, then that Iron Rod, that is the
exact mea&s;ure of the length of the String of the <HI>Pendulum</HI> this Year, will be
differing from the length of the &s;ame, which was three or four Years &s;ince,
and may be three or four Years hence; this therefore ought to be fir&s;t ex|amin'd
by Experience, before any certain Conclu&s;ion can be made there|upon.</P>
<P>Thirdly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And at differ|ent sea&s;ons.</NOTE> It is not yet certainly known but that the Gravitating Power of
the Earth may be different at various Sea&s;ons of the Year, as when the Earth
is in its <HI>Apholion</HI> and <HI>Perihelion;</HI> for which po&s;&s;ibly there may be a plau&s;ible
Rea&s;on a&s;&s;ign'd; and if &s;o, it will then be nece&s;&s;ary to mention at what time
<PB N="460" REF="439">
of the Year the mea&s;ure is taken; for if the gravitating Power &s;hould be found
to be le&s;&s;er when the Earth is in its <HI>Perihelion</HI> in our Winter, than when in
its <HI>Aphelion</HI> in the Summer, then the <HI>Pendulum</HI> mu&s;t be accordingly propor|tion'd to the time of the Year.</P>
<P>Fourthly, If the Rotation or Diurnal Motion of the Earth &s;hould be ac|celerated
in its <HI>Perihelion</HI> in our Winter, and retarded in its <HI>Aphetion</HI> in our
Summer, as the ingenious <HI>Kepler</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, and &s;eems to a&s;&s;ert from Experi|ments,
then the quite contrary will follow, and the <HI>Pendulum</HI> mu&s;t be &s;horter
for the Winter than for the Summer; which will be nece&s;&s;ary to be prov'd by
trials, before any thing can be built thereupon.</P>
<P>Fifthly, If both the&s;e two la&s;t mention'd Effects are produc'd, and that
they keep in &s;ome proportion one to another, then a <HI>Pendulum</HI> of the &s;ame
length may &s;erve at all Sea&s;ons of the Year; but if either exceed the other in
that proportion, then mu&s;t the length of the <HI>Pendulum</HI> be accordingly
lengthen'd or &s;hortn'd.</P>
<P>Sixthly, If the differing Den&s;ity of the Air have an influence upon the Mo|tion
and Velocity of the <HI>Pendulum</HI> made in it, as mo&s;t certainly it has, and
that a Body in a den&s;e Air moves not &s;o quick, <HI>Caeteris paribus,</HI> as in a rarify'd
Air, then the <HI>Pendulum</HI> mu&s;t be &s;horten'd in the Winter, and lengthen'd in
the Summer; and &s;o the &s;ame mea&s;ure will not la&s;t round the Year.</P>
<P>Seventhly, If the <HI>Pendulum</HI> be made of a Bra&s;s, Silver, or Iron Rod, then
the length of the &s;ame Rod will be greater in Summer than in Winter, and
con&s;equently the &s;pace mea&s;ur'd therewith will be found &s;horter in Summer
than in Winter; for tho&s;e and the other Metals, when hot, will have larger
Dimen&s;ions than when cold, and &s;o cannot make an exact Standard for the
mea&s;ure of length.</P>
<P>Eighthly, If the <HI>Pendulum</HI> be made with twi&s;ted Threads, then the Threads
will be found to be longer in dry Weather than in moi&s;t, and &s;o 'twill be nece&s;|&s;ary
to take an account of the Sea&s;ons when the Experiments are made, and
to reduce to exactne&s;s the limits of &s;uch shrinking and &s;tretching.</P>
<P>I could mention divers other Objections again&s;t this way, tho' notwith|&s;tanding
I conceive it to be the be&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t that has been yet Publi&s;h'd;
and with finding out the true limitations to all tho&s;e Qualifications, it may
po&s;&s;ibly prove the be&s;t for u&s;e.</P>
<P>There have been others who have thought the be&s;t way for the making an
univer&s;al Standard for the mea&s;uring of length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Degree pro|pos'd for an u|niver&s;al Stand|ard.</NOTE> to be the finding the exact
length of a Degree upon the Earth; and to do that by mo&s;t exactly determin|ing
two places upon the Earth that are both in the &s;ame <HI>Meridian,</HI> and differ
from each other exactly one Degree of Latitude, ob&s;erv'd by a very large and
curious In&s;trument; which places being &s;o found out, their true di&s;tance is to
be exactly mea&s;ur'd and found &s;ome one certain mea&s;ure; then this length, to
be divided into &s;ixty equal Parts, which may be called Geographical Miles or
Minutes, and each &s;ixtieth part being &s;ubdivided into a thou&s;and parts, may
denote Geographical Paces, and each thou&s;anth part, being again &s;ubdivided
into five parts, may denote a Geographical Foot, and each of the&s;e fifth parts
being again &s;ubdivided into twelve, may denote Geographical Inches; and
the&s;e again &s;ubdivided into twelve parts, may denote Geographical Lines;
and &s;o &s;ubdividing onward by Duodecimals the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible length may be
determin'd in proportion to the Circumference or Diameter of the Earth.</P>
<P>But again&s;t this way of making a Standard for the mea&s;ure of length there
may be the&s;e things Objected; Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Objections a|gain&s;t this way</NOTE> The great difficulty that there will be,
Fir&s;t, To determine exactly by A&s;tronomical Ob&s;ervation two &s;uch places to
the certainty of five Hundred Foot. Secondly, In mea&s;uring their true di|&s;tance.</P>
<P>Secondly, If the Body of the Earth be not exactly Sphaerical, then the mea|&s;ure
of a Degree, taken in one Latitude, will be differing from what it is
in another, and &s;o it mu&s;t be determin'd, Fir&s;t, By trials exactly made in
differing Latitudes, whether any &s;uch difference be or not, before any Conclu|&s;ion can be made thereupon.</P>
<P><PB N="461" REF="440">
Thirdly, 'Tis not improbable but that the Body of the Earth it&s;elf may
&s;hrink and grow clo&s;er together, and &s;o grow le&s;&s;er, that the Gravity thereof
does continually pre&s;s the parts thereof harder, and po&s;&s;ibly clo&s;er together;
and &s;o 'tis po&s;&s;ible the irregular Surface of the Earth may have been, in part,
caus'd by the puckering of the Cortical Parts thereof; and if &s;o, then the
mea&s;ures, this way found, will every Age grow &s;horter and &s;horter; which,
po&s;&s;ibly, may have been the Rea&s;on why the mea&s;ures of a Degree, which
have been taken in &s;everal Ages, have always been found &s;horter and &s;horter,
the later they have been taken, as I before-mention'd.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The &s;ame Objections do lie about the &s;hrinking and &s;welling of
the la&s;t Sub&s;tance that pre&s;erves the Standard, as in the former way. I could
in&s;tance in &s;ome other Objections, but that I conceive the&s;e will be &s;ufficient
to &s;hew the difficulty of procuring &s;uch a mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I have been more particular upon this Inquiry, for that this &s;eems to be
the very <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> and Foundation of Geography and Navigation; and, 'till this
be well determin'd, all the Super&s;tructure will be but infirm.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 21. 1683. I did the la&s;t Day explain to you the nece&s;&s;ity there was of
a certain and determinate Mea&s;ure or Standard of length;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The u&s;e of an univer&s;al Stan|dard for mea|&s;ure.</NOTE> for that might be
&s;o, not only to all the World at pre&s;ent, but that it be and remain to all Po|&s;terity for the future; that &s;o, by means of that, all things that could be re|duc'd
to a certain Weight, Mea&s;ure, Capacity, Power, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> might, by that
means, be compar'd, Fir&s;t, To that common Standard-mea&s;ure, and after|wards
one with another; becau&s;e without &s;uch a natural and perpetual Stan|dard,
neither could the pre&s;ent quantities of things be compar'd with tho&s;e
of preceding Ages, nor indeed one with another at pre&s;ent; nor could future
Ages have the true U&s;e and Benefit in this Particular of the Obver&s;ations
and Inventions of this pre&s;ent; for to in&s;tance in no other Particular at
pre&s;ent, I &s;hew'd you how every one of the mea&s;ures of the Earth taken by
any of the Antients differ'd both one from another, and all of them from the
mea&s;ures now la&s;t of all found; and how tho&s;e quantities, which they took of
a Degree, thereby &s;eem'd to have dimini&s;h'd ever &s;ince the fir&s;t that was ta|ken
this way. So that it doth nece&s;&s;arily follow, either that the Standard-mea&s;ure,
made u&s;e of by them, did continually increa&s;e or grow bigger, the
longer it remain'd in the World, or that the very Body of the Earth it&s;elf,
did really, from time to time, as it grew older and older, &s;hrink into le&s;s
and le&s;s Dimen&s;ions, much after the &s;ame way as we find divers animated Bo|dies,
as Plants and Animals, upon growing old, really to do; whence, as I
hinted, the Mountains and Vallies, and the like inequalities of the Earth's
Surface might &s;eem to be nothing el&s;e but the wrinkles and puckering of the
Skin of the old <HI>Ve&s;ta.</HI> There is no impo&s;&s;ibility nor ab&s;urdity in either of
the&s;e Solutions or Suppo&s;itions. Nor will I determine or prepo&s;&s;e&s;s any with
a po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertion of my Opinion, which is the mo&s;t likely; only this I may
&s;ay, that there &s;eems a kind of unnece&s;&s;ity to admit either the one or the other,
If at lea&s;t we will give any credit to the truth of the Relations, or to the
certainty and exactne&s;s of their Ob&s;ervations (for it may lie al&s;o in either
of tho&s;e) but that &s;eems not &s;o probable;<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the Earth &s;hrinks.</NOTE> for my part I am inclin'd to be|lieve
that the Body of the Earth doth really &s;hrink and grow le&s;s, by rea&s;on
that the Gravity of the Earth doth &s;eem to pre&s;s and ram the parts thereof
continually clo&s;er and clo&s;er together, and for that it &s;eemeth not &s;o na|tural
to conceive that the common mea&s;ure &s;hould continually grow bigger
and bigger, e&s;pecially, &s;ince it is believ'd rather that the &s;ize of Men grows
le&s;s and le&s;s, and con&s;equently it &s;eems le&s;s probable, that the Foot, Fathom,
Pace, and the like, which are deduc'd from the &s;ize of Mens Feet, fathoming
and going, &s;hould grow bigger; but be that what it will, it &s;eems at lea&s;t to
&s;hew the great U&s;e and Conveniency of a natural, univer&s;al, and perpetual
Standard of length: I have already mention'd two ways that have been
thought of and attempted for the making this univer&s;al Standard, and tho&s;e
were; Fir&s;t, The length of a &s;ingle free <HI>Pendulum</HI> vibrating Seconds of
Time.</P>
<P><PB N="462" REF="441">
Secondly, The length of one Thou&s;anth part of a Minute or Mile found
upon the Earth by accurate A&s;tronomical and Geometrical Men&s;uration to
be for a Geometrical Pace, and a fifth part of that for a Foot.</P>
<P>I told you al&s;o what Objections there lay both again&s;t the one and the o|ther
way, and I &s;hew'd you al&s;o how tho&s;e uncertainties might be a&s;certain'd,
and the difficulties remov'd; but neither of them could be perfectly regu|lated
and a&s;certain'd without a great deal of Care, Pains and Skill, which yet
(for all accurate Ob&s;ervations) is nece&s;&s;ary to be done. I could have &s;hew'd
&s;ome other ways of making a univer&s;al, natural and perpetual Mea&s;ure;
but for the purpo&s;e of Geography and Navigation, the&s;e po&s;&s;ibly, when
rectify'd as they ought, may prove the be&s;t. I explain'd the la&s;t time how
one of tho&s;e mea&s;ures might be found or made by Ob&s;ervation; I &s;hall now
a little more particularly di&s;cour&s;e of the &s;econd way, namely, That, by the
true length of a Degree upon the level Surface of the Earth, found by accurate
Ob&s;ervations. Now there are many ways to find out and determine the
Magnitude of a Degree that are mention'd by Authors, and there may be
many more; but they may be all reduc'd to two general Heads.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ways of mea&s;uring a Degree.</NOTE> Such as require &s;ome Caele&s;tial Ob&s;ervations to determine the De|gree,
or other certain part of a great Circle imagin'd upon the Surface of
the Earth.</P>
<P>And, Secondly, Such as only require Ob&s;ervations made upon the Earth
to determine the &s;ame. The Fir&s;t, for brevity's &s;ake, may be call'd the A|&s;tronomical;
the Second Geographical.</P>
<P>The A&s;tronomical ways are two,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The A&s;trono|mical ways.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> Fir&s;t, The finding the difference of
Latitude between two places lying due North and South of each other, or
under the &s;ame Meridian, by accurate Ob&s;ervations of &s;ome Caele&s;tial Bodies,
whether Sun or Stars.</P>
<P>And the Second, The finding the &s;aid difference of Latitude between two
places lying in &s;ome other Po&s;ition to each other, who&s;e true Po&s;itions are
known, and not in or very near the Ea&s;t and We&s;t of each other, and &s;o
finding the proportional length of the part of the Azymuthal Circle, then
finding by exact Men&s;uration upon the Earth, or otherwi&s;e with &s;ome known
mea&s;ure, the true di&s;tance between them in a &s;traight Line.</P>
<P>The A&s;tronomical Ob&s;ervations nece&s;&s;ary for the finding the true <HI>Latitude</HI>
of any place may be either made in the Day or in Night;<NOTE PLACE="marg">To find the La|titude of a place.</NOTE> by the Sun
who&s;e Altitude, Azymuth and Declination for any time of the Day being
known, the <HI>Latitude</HI> may ea&s;ily be found, but the be&s;t of all Azimuths is the
true South and Meridian: For that Fir&s;t, The labour of Calculation to re|duce
it to the Meridian is &s;av'd: But, Secondly, Becau&s;e the Body of the
Sun is there mov'd with a horizontal or level motion, and &s;o does not &s;o &s;ud|dainly
Change its Altitude, but remain &s;en&s;ibly the &s;ame for &s;ome time.
Thirdly, Becau&s;e the Body of the Sun is there mo&s;t remov'd from the Hori|zon,
and &s;o will there have the lea&s;t Refraction, which, in this Ca&s;e is very
con&s;iderable, and mu&s;t be avoided as far as may be. In the Night the Lati|tude
of a Place may be found by the ob&s;ervation of the Altitude of any one
known Star, who&s;e Azymuth and Declination is known; but here al&s;o the
be&s;t Po&s;ition of any &s;uch Star for this purpo&s;e is, when it is in the Meri|dian,
and if it pa&s;s the Meridian both Northwards and Southwards, the Zen|ith,
the be&s;t is that $word$ the Southwards; and of all Stars for this purpo&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stars near the Zenith be&s;t for this purpo&s;e.</NOTE>
tho&s;e are be&s;t for &s;uch Ob&s;ervations as pa&s;s the neare&s;t the Zenith of the
place. (Becau&s;e, as I &s;hew'd before, the great incumbrance of all&punc; All ronomi|cal
Ob&s;ervations is thereby remov'd, namely, Refraction.) Now, the Re|fractions
are always &s;o much the greater, the nearer the Body ob&s;erv'd is to
the Horizon, but the nearer the Zenith the le&s;s; but the $word$ of pro|portions
of &s;uch Refractions is not &s;o certainly found, becau&s;e, neither is the
Refraction the &s;ame at all places, nor the &s;ame at one and the &s;ame place at
differing Sea&s;ons of the Year, nor in differing times of the Day and Night,
<PB N="463" REF="442">
tho' the Sun or Star be in both tho&s;e times in the &s;ame Altitude, and is not
yet reduc'd to any certain Rule or Calculation: And therefore the be&s;t way of
all, is that which doth wholly avoid that Inconvenience, which is the way that
I above twenty Years &s;ince, for this very end and intention, explain'd to the
<HI>Royal Society,</HI> and which, about fourteen Years &s;ince, I made u&s;e of in making
my Ob&s;ervations for the finding the parallax of the Orb of the Earth among
the fix'd Stars, which had hardly been po&s;&s;ible any other way, e&s;pecially to
avoid all manner of Doubt or Objection; and that was the Ob&s;ervation of
&s;ome Star which pa&s;s'd very near the Zenith of the place; where in a very
clear Night there is no Refraction at all; and this was the way which Mon|&s;ieur
<HI>Picart,</HI> and the Gentlemen of the Royal <HI>Academy</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> have, &s;ince
that time, made u&s;e of in their Ob&s;ervation for the finding the difference of
Latitude between <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Amiens,</HI> which, upon this account, is much more
accurate than any of the other ways which before that time had been taken by
any, either of the Antients or Moderns who had made this Ob&s;ervation: For
tho' I confe&s;s we do not certainly know what ways &s;ome of the Antients made
u&s;e of, yet by con&s;idering of the ways they might make u&s;e of, we may with
probability enough conceive, that it was not this way, by ob&s;erving the Stars
in the Zenith, e&s;pecially &s;ince we do not find that they had any notion of Re|fraction
at all, and therefore 'twas not very probable that they &s;hould provide
again&s;t it, the notion or invention of Refraction being not much before <HI>Ti|cho
Brahe,</HI> and he &s;eems to be the fir&s;t that reduc'd it to Rule; for tho' <HI>Ptolo|my</HI>
and &s;ome of the Antients did take &s;ome notice of the alterations of the
Air, and of &s;ome alterations they caus'd in the appearances of Caele&s;tial Bo|dies
through them, yet it &s;eem'd to be no more than this, That they con|ceiv'd
that the gro&s;&s;er Air and Vapours near the Horizon did cau&s;e the Cae|le&s;tial
Bodies to appear greater near the Horizon than near the Zenith, which
was a mi&s;take likewi&s;e; for neither does the Refraction of the Air any ways
cau&s;e &s;uch an appearance, but rather the contrary; nor is there indeed really
any &s;uch appearance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Refraction does not make Bo|dies to appear bigger near the Horizon.</NOTE> if it be more curiou&s;ly inquir'd into, it being only Opti|cal,
and ri&s;ing from the imaginary greater di&s;tance of the Sun and Moon
near the Horizon, where the known di&s;tances upon the Earth can be com|par'd
with them; for otherwi&s;e the Bodies of the Sun and Moon would ap|pear
le&s;s, as is very evident in the vertical <HI>Diameter,</HI> which is &s;ometime a
quarter le&s;s than it ought to be, as any one that will examine the Ri&s;ing or
Setting Sun, will plainly perceive, by the help of a Tele&s;cope fitted with a
Micrometer. Again, The Refraction of the Air elevating the two extream
Points of the Horizontal Diameter pretty near perpendicularly in the two
Vertical Circles that pa&s;s through tho&s;e Points; and all tho&s;e Vertical Cir|cles
meeting in the Zenith, it follows, that the greater the Refraction of the
Atmo&s;phere is, the &s;horter will appear the Horizontal Diameter of the Sun
or Moon, nor was this Propriety, whether known or not, made u&s;e of by any
before <HI>Ticho Brahe,</HI> tho' ever &s;ince that time it hath been acknowlodg'd and
verify'd by all A&s;tronomers, and yet 'tis not agreed upon, what the Proporti|ons
of it are; but a &s;ort of randum Numbers are &s;et down, of which the true
ground is not a&s;&s;ign'd, that I know, any where; and po&s;&s;ibly the thing it &s;elf in
&s;trictne&s;s may be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, being uncertain even in it&s;elf, and being
in a continual &s;tate of change.</P>
<P>I need not, I &s;uppo&s;e, mention the way how to come by the Latitude of a
place where the Declination, Altitude and Azymuth is given, that being com|mon
and ea&s;ily enough known. Nor &s;hall I need to mention any other diffi|culties
in this A&s;tronomical way, but rather proceed to the &s;econd way how
to find two places in any Po&s;ition what&s;oever, which are di&s;tant from each o|ther
a Degree of a great Circle of the Earth, or any other le&s;s a&s;&s;ignable
part without making any Ob&s;ervation of any Caele&s;tial Body; which is that
which I call the Geographical or Mechanical way.</P>
<P>This Mechanical or Geographical Probleme then may,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Geographi|cal way of mea&s;uring a Degree.</NOTE> by various Means
and In&s;truments, be perform'd according to the particular way that is made
u&s;e of for effecting thereof; the thing that is to be found being the inclination,
of the Perpendiculars of two di&s;tinct places one to another. This, as I told
you, was mo&s;t certainly found by finding where tho&s;e Perpendiculars pointed
<PB N="464" REF="443">
in the Heavens, by &s;eeing how far the Zenith of the place was di&s;tant from
this or that Star which pa&s;s'd the Meridian, the Zenith of the place being
the continuation or upper end of the Perpendicular or Plumb-line of the place.
This al&s;o may be found by Calculation from the height of the Sun or fix'd
Stars taken in any known Azymuth. But the Geographical ways are by the
level Lines of any two di&s;tant places, which level Lines are Lines at right
Angles, to the Perpendiculars of tho&s;e places; and in this way the Query is to
find what Angle the two level Lines make with one another, or with the Per|pendiculars
of the di&s;tant places. This way, were the Ray of Vi&s;ion from
place to place a true &s;traight Line, might, by convenient In&s;truments, be
made the ea&s;ie&s;t and the mo&s;t exact; and it were po&s;&s;ible this way to deter|mine
the quantity of a Degree even to a &s;ingle Third, which would come
within two Foot by mea&s;ure, according to the quantity of a Degree collected
from the be&s;t Ob&s;ervations which have yet been made. So that could the
Men&s;uration of the di&s;tance be made as exact as the Ob&s;ervation of the level
Line, or the certainty of the magnitude of the Body of the Earth, or of the
quantity of a Degree, it might be adju&s;ted to all imaginable exactne&s;s; and &s;ince
there are &s;ome places upon the Earth which may be &s;een more than a Degree,
nay, more than two Degrees di&s;tant, it were po&s;&s;ible to determine it within
one &s;ingle Foot: For, Fir&s;t, By means of the level of Water, an In&s;tru|ment
to take the level Line may be made of any length de&s;ir'd &s;o as to be
able to di&s;tingui&s;h Thirds of a Degree; and &s;ince by the help of Tele&s;copes,
which may be made and ea&s;ily u&s;ed in a Horizontal Po&s;ture almo&s;t to any
length, the &s;ight can di&s;tingui&s;h the parts of the Object to as great a certainty,
there need to be no deficiency in the exactne&s;s of &s;uch Ob&s;ervations, were the
Rays of Vi&s;ion true right Lines. And by the &s;ame means of long Tele&s;cope
Sights, the di&s;tances between &s;uch two Stations might as accurately be mea|&s;ur'd,
as I &s;hall mention by and by. There are various ways or performing
it this way, mention'd in &s;everal Authors, but I think none more plain and
ea&s;y than the&s;e I &s;hall in&s;tance in.</P>
<P>As, Fir&s;t, From a very high Cliff adjoining to Sea, the Altitude of the
&s;ame above the level of the Sea being exactly mea&s;er'd the Angle that the
Perpendicular makes with the vi&s;ual Ray, that touches the Horizon of the
Sea, mu&s;t be exactly ob&s;erv'd; or el&s;e the Angle that the vi&s;ual Ray makes
with the Horiozantal or level Line; for in both tho&s;e Ca&s;es the Effect $word$
Con&s;equence is the &s;ame; for the level Line being at right Angles with $word$
Perpendicular of the afore&s;aid Angles &s;o found, mu&s;t be the complement of
the other to a right Angle.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Table <HI>IX.</HI> Fig. 4.</NOTE> As for in&s;tance, let CD repre&s;ent the Surface
of the Sea, A the Center of the Earth, BC the Cliff, the height of
who&s;e highe&s;t Point B above the level of the Sea is exactly known by mea&s;ure,
the Angle ABD is found by the Plumb-line BC, and the Tele&s;cope BG direct|ed
at the Horizon of the Sea D, or the complement thereof the Angle FBG
is found by the level EF, and Tele&s;cope BG; having therefore the Angle
ABD by Ob&s;ervation, the complement there of ABD is likewi&s;e given and
in the &s;ame manner, if FBG be given by Ob&s;ervation, BAD equal to it is al&s;o
given. Now by the common Tables or Secants you may from the length of
BC and the Angle DBF or DAB ea&s;ily deduce the Diameter of the Earth;
for as the difference between the Radius and the Secant of the Angle at A is
to the Radius, &s;o is the height of the Cliff BC, to the Semidiameter of the
Earth. I could have in&s;tanc'd in &s;everal other ways of finding the Diamet$$
of the Earth from the knowledge of the&s;e two, or which <HI>Ca&s;&s;ati</HI> in his <HI>Terra
Machinis Mota,</HI> gives a great many, &s;ome of them complicated enough, but
I mention this as being the mo&s;t facile and &s;imple way that can be thought
upon, there being hardly any difficulty at all, either in the In&s;truments nece&s;|&s;ary

<P><PB N="465" REF="444">
But what I mention'd to you heretofore to be the incumbrance and per|plexity
of all A&s;tronomical Ob&s;ervations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The inconve|niences of this and the like ways from Re|fraction.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> the Refraction, or rather In|flection

that how plau&s;ible &s;oever this may &s;eem, yet this inconvenience in|terferring
makes it almo&s;t wholly impo&s;&s;ible: For the Rays of Vi&s;ion which
run as Tangents to the Surface of the Sea, are by the Refractivene&s;s or ra|ther
Inflectivene&s;s of the vaporous Air near the Horizon rais'd much higher
than they ought to be, if they proceeded in direct Lines from the Eye or
Sight of the In&s;trument at the top of the Cliff to the Horizontal Point D of
the Surface: Which Refraction or Inflection, were it al&s;o certain, might, by
&s;ome trials, be remedied and reduced to a Rule, but that being &s;o extreamly
uncertain, and various, and differing almo&s;t with every bla&s;t of Wind, and
every &s;everal Degree of Heat and Cold, Drine&s;s, or Moi&s;ture, Gravity, or
Levity of the Air, the Effects thereby produc'd are &s;o various and uncertain;
that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to reduce them to any certain Rule.</P>
<P>However,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;econd Geo|graphical way.</NOTE> for variety, I &s;hall mention a &s;econd Geographical way which may
be made u&s;e of for this purpo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> from two very high Hills which are very
far remov'd from each other, as &s;uppo&s;e 60, 80, 100, or more Miles, which
yet are &s;o &s;ituated, as that by means of a great Plain between, or el&s;e of an
interjacent Sea, they are vi&s;ible each to other, whereof there are many in|&s;tances
to be found in the World, and even in <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Wales.</HI>
Let the inclination of the common vi&s;ual Ray between them be exactly ob|&s;erv'd
with the Perpendiculars or level Lines of both tho&s;e Places, and thence
deduce the true inclinations of the two Perpendiculars, or the two level
Lines of tho&s;e places to one another, whereby you will certainly have the
quantity of the Angle of the Perpendiculars at the Center of the Earth, or
the quantity of the Arch of a great Circle of the Earth that is interjacent
between tho&s;e places; then if the di&s;tance be over a Plain upon the Land by
mea&s;uring the interjacent Space by Chains, Rods, Wheels, or Triangles of
ob&s;ervation made from place to place, you will obtain the di&s;tance between
tho&s;e Stations, and con&s;equently the Magnitude or Semidiameter of the
Globe of the Earth. Or if the &s;pace interjacent be over the Sea, then by
mea&s;uring a certain length of Ground at right Angles with the vi&s;ual Ray, if
it may be upon either of the &s;aid Hills, which is vi&s;ible from the other of
tho&s;e Hills, and by exact Ob&s;ervation finding all the Angles of &s;uch a Tri|angle,
you will ea&s;ily and very exactly, and much truer than by any Men&s;u|ration
made between them, obtain the &s;ame thing as the other way, namely,
the true di&s;tance between them, and con&s;equently the Magnitude or Semi|diameter
of the Globe of the Earth; for in&s;tance, in the Figure, let B and
C repre&s;ent the tops of two very high Hills di&s;tant from each other, by com|pute
about three&s;core common <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles, which are notwith&s;tanding by
means of a large Vale or Sea between them, vi&s;ible to each other. By In|&s;truments
as before,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Table IX. Figs.</NOTE> find at B the Angle ABC of the Perpendicular AB with
the vi&s;ual Ray BC, and by Ob&s;ervations at C find the &s;aid inclination of the
Perpendicular AC, and vi&s;ual Ray CB, namely the Angle ACB; then either
by an actual Men&s;uration of the Space or Di&s;tance BC, or by Triangles of
Ob&s;ervation in <HI>S$elius</HI> his way, or el&s;e by mea&s;uring a certain length, as BD
on the top of one of the Hills, as B, who&s;e extreams, B a D are vi&s;ible to each
other, and to the Point C of the other Hill, find any two of the Angles
at BC and D, and from thence find the &s;ide BC, and having before all the
Angles A, B, and C, you will ea&s;ily find the Sides AB and AC which are the
di&s;tances of tho&s;e places from the Center of the Earth, and if the &s;pace in|terjacent
be Sea, you will ea&s;ily obtain the &s;ide AE, which is the Semidiame|ter
of the Globe, or Sphaerical Surface of the Sea, and con&s;equently the true
length of a Degree of a great Circle on the Sea, which, for Navigation, is
the principal thing &s;ought, and thence al&s;o collaterally may ea&s;ily be found
the &s;everal heights of tho&s;e Hills B and C above that level, and the like.<NOTE PLACE="marg">This way has its inconveni|ences.</NOTE>
But this way, as the former, is al&s;o incumbr'd with the Refraction, or ra|ther
Inflection of the Air; &s;o that the Line BC is not really a &s;traight Line,
but a crooked or bended Line, and &s;o tho&s;e places B and C are vi&s;ibie to each
other much farther than they really could be, were there no inflection in the
<PB N="466" REF="445">
Air, but that the Ray that touch'd the Sea interjacent, did always proceed
&s;traight.</P>
<P>We need not therefore trouble our &s;elves either with tho&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Micrography. <HI>p.</HI> 217</NOTE> or with any
other of the like ways, tho' there are divers to be found di&s;per&s;'d here and
there in Authors, and more of that kind might be thought of, but they will
be all in vain, &s;ince the Refraction or Inflection of the Ray near the Horizon,
upon the exact ob&s;ervation of which &s;o much is built, do &s;o confound the truth
of the Angle, that &s;ince great things are to be calculated from little, 'twill
be in vain to think of coming at any po&s;&s;ible certainty by the ways of Ob&s;er|vation.
Now, that this is not <HI>Gratis dictum,</HI> be&s;ides what I my &s;elf have ob|&s;erv'd,
and Publi&s;h'd at large in the Year 1664, let me acquaint you with
what the <HI>French</HI> have lately taken notice of in their way of trying by a Le|vel:
They ob&s;erv'd then, that an Object which at break of Day appear'd in
the Horizon, or Level-line, or a little above it, a little after Sun-ri&s;ing
appear'd below it; and the &s;ame appearance they found in the Evening, for the
Object before Sun-&s;et appear'd below the Level, which &s;oon after Sun-&s;et would
appear in it or above it; in&s;omuch, that in half an Hours time the difference
has been ob&s;erv'd to be no le&s;s than three Minutes, which mu&s;t needs cau&s;e a
very great Error in the computation of the Magnitude of a Degree, and con|&s;equently
the Magnitude of the Earth; for if there be three or four Miles
Error in the &s;pace of le&s;s than a quarter of a Degree, it will amount to an
Error of a fifth or &s;ixth part of a Degree in a whole Degree, and &s;o a va&s;t
Error in the Compa&s;s of the Earth. The cau&s;e of which appearances they
conceive to be the Cold of the Night conden&s;ing the Vapours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cau&s;e of this Inflection.</NOTE> and &s;o mak|ing
them to de&s;cend towards the Earth, leaving the higher parts of the Air
more pure, thin and &s;erene, which makes an Inflection of the Ray which is to
pa&s;s obliquely through Media of &s;uch differing den&s;ity, and &s;o the Refraction
or Inflection is the le&s;s. But yet, even then the Ray doth not pa&s;s without
a con&s;iderable Refraction or Inflection; for which they give us Experiments
of two Ob&s;ervations both made at Noon Day, by which the &s;ame Per&s;ons not
only found there was a Refraction, but that there was a con&s;iderable difference
between one Day and another Day at Noon as to their Refractions. To this
purpo&s;e in the Summer time, at Noon, in a clear Day, they ob&s;erv'd the
Tower of <HI>Montlehery</HI> from the top of the Tower of <HI>No&s;tre Dame</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI>
and found the Foot of the laid Tower of <HI>Montlehery</HI> to appear exactly in the
Level or Horizontal Line; but &s;ome Days after, at Noon al&s;o, ob&s;erving the
top of <HI>No&s;tre Dame</HI> Tower from the Foot of the Tower of <HI>Montlehery,</HI> they
found it to be 11'. 30''. below the level; but comparing the mea&s;ur'd di&s;tance
of tho&s;e two places, and examining from the mea&s;ure of a Degree, found the
other way namele&s;s by the Perpendicular Stars, they found that the Angle
ought to have been 13'. 30''. which is two whole Minutes difference in the di&s;tance
of 81894 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Feet, or about fifteen Miles and an half; by which we may
plainly &s;ee what exactne&s;s is to be expected from any Men&s;uration of the
Earth that &s;hould be this way made; and therefore there can be no more
certain way of determining the Magnitude of the Earth by mea&s;ure, than the
way I fir&s;t of all propos'd, and that was by ob&s;erving the Stars near the Zenith.</P>
<P>Now,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The V&s;e and Benefit of Re|fraction or In|flection.</NOTE> tho' this inflective quality of the Air be a great incumbrance and
confu&s;ion of A&s;tronomical Ob&s;ervations made both at Sea and Land, yet is it
not without &s;ome con&s;iderable benefit to Navigation; and indeed in &s;ome
ca&s;es the benefit thereby attain'd is much greater than would be the benefit of
of having the Ray proceed in an exact &s;traight Line. I &s;hall not need to in|&s;tance
in the Ob&s;ervation made by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> that wintered upon <HI>Nova
Zembla,</HI> who, by means hereof, found that the Night in that place &s;hortned
no le&s;s than a whole Month, which mu&s;t needs be a very great Comfort to
all &s;uch places as lie very far towards the North or South Poles, where the
length of the Night, and want of &s;eeing the Sun, cannot chu&s;e but be very
tedious and irk&s;ome. But then it may be &s;aid, that this benefit is only to a
very &s;mall part of the World, and that the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable and lea&s;t fre|quented
of all, by rea&s;on of the extreamity of the Cold, and want of other
nece&s;&s;ary accommodations for the u&s;e of Man. But yet we find chat &s;ome of
tho&s;e Northern Parts have, of late Years, been frequented by Navigation
<PB N="467" REF="446">
not without very con&s;iderable benefit and advantage in the returns, and may,
in time, be very much more, when the Indu&s;try and Skill of future Underta|kers
&s;hall di&s;cover Pa&s;&s;ages that way to the <HI>Indies</HI> or South Sea, which for &s;e|veral
Rea&s;ons, I conceive, may in time be effected, and with very great ad|vantage
frequented: But this only by the bye. The great advantage I con|&s;ider
therein, is the fir&s;t di&s;covery of Land upon the Sea; for by means here|of
the tops of Hills and high Lands are rai&s;ed up into the Air &s;o as to be di&s;|coverable
&s;everal Leagues farther off on the Sea than they would be, were
there no &s;uch Refraction; which is of great benefit to Navigators for &s;teer|ing
their Cour&s;e in the Night when they approach near Land, and likewi&s;e
for directing them in the Day-time much more certainly than the mo&s;t exact
Caele&s;tial Ob&s;ervations could do by the help of an uninflected Ray, e&s;pecial|ly
in &s;uch places as they have no &s;oundings.</P>
<P>And I doubt not but that by &s;ome Ob&s;ervations carefully made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To di&s;cover a Ships di&s;tance at Sea.</NOTE> the In|flections
of the Air may be reduc'd to exactne&s;s enough, for &s;everal &s;orts of
Terre&s;trial Ob&s;ervations which may be of great u&s;e in the practice of Navi|gation,
tho' I very much doubt whether it will ever be exact enough for de|termining
the mea&s;ure of a Degree, and con&s;equently that of the Earth; the
u&s;e that I chiefly intend of this di&s;covery may be for determining the di&s;tance
of a Ship at Sea by means hereof from a Land &s;o rai&s;ed: The way how I con|ceive
this may be effected is thus. Fir&s;t, The de&s;cent of the true Level-line
below the apparent Level-line, for &s;everal di&s;tances, mu&s;t be known by Cal|culation,
the true Level being a Circular Line upon a Sphaerical Superficies of
the Earth, and the apparent Level-line being a tangent Line, it will be ea&s;y
enough from the knowledge of the Earths Semidiameter to find this De&s;cent.</P>
<P>Now the Semidiameter of the Earth from the mo&s;t accurate Ob&s;ervations
that have been yet made being 20923500&frac45; Feet, or 3962&frac34; Miles, and 180
Feet of 5280, which is our Statute <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mile, it will follow that the true
Level-line will be ea&s;ily found by the help of a Table of Secants; the De|&s;cent
below the Horizontal Line for any determinate, di&s;tance being always to
the Semidiameter of the Earth, as the exce&s;s of the Secant of the di&s;tance a|bove
the Radius is to the Radius. But becau&s;e this Statute Mile is of no u&s;e
in Navigation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of reduceing the mea&s;ure of a Mile.</NOTE> Navigation always accounting the &s;ixtieth part of a Degree
to be a Mile, and three of tho&s;e Miles to be a League, it will be nece&s;&s;ary
to reduce the Mile, we account by, to the mea&s;ure of a Degree found, account|ing
it to be a full &s;ixtieth part of the length thereof which is found, and ac|cordingly
ought to be the Mea&s;ures and Divi&s;ions of the Log-line. Now,
by the afore&s;aid Ob&s;ervations there being no le&s;s than 365184 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Feet
in a whole Degree, there will be 6086 4/10 Feet in a &s;ixtieth part thereof, and
therefore the mea&s;ure of every &s;uch Mile ought to be accounted 1014 Fathom
two Foot and 4/10, and con&s;equently a League will be 18259, or 18260 Feet,
or 3043 Fathom and two Foot; the De&s;cent then for &s;uch Leagues will be as
follows, for one &s;uch League, 7, 976688 Feet, or to make u&s;e of round numbers
eight Feet, at two Leagues di&s;tance thirty two Foot, at three Leagues &s;even|ty
two Foot, at four Leagues one hundred and thirty Foot; or if you will
reckon by Minute Miles, then the de&s;cent of one Mile is 10 &frac23; Inches almo&s;t,
at two Miles will be three Foot and an half, at three Miles eight Foot, at
four Miles fourteen Feet, or thereabout; at five twenty two Foot and an
half, at &s;ix Miles thirty two Foot, at &s;even Miles forty four Foot, at eight
Miles fifty &s;ix Foot, at nine Miles &s;eventy two Foot. Now the u&s;e that may
be made of this knowledge I conceive to be this, that when a Land is ap|proach'd
by a&s;cending the Shore or Ma&s;t with a &s;mall Per&s;pective Gla&s;s, 'till
the Surf of the Sea upon the Shore be di&s;cover'd by knowing the height of
the Eye, that &s;o di&s;covers it from the Surface of the Water by the Ship, a
much nearer and truer compute of the di&s;tance thereof can be made than by
any other way yet practis'd: But this only here by the bye, becau&s;e hereafter
when I come to &s;peak of that Subject, I &s;hall mention &s;everal other fea&s;able
ways of doing it. I here only mention it upon the account of the Refractive|ne&s;s
of the Air, which tho' it &s;poil the accuracy of Ob&s;ervations for the mea|&s;ure
of a Degree, yet in &s;uch Ob&s;ervations as the&s;e it may &s;erve well enough, at
lea&s;t 'till better and more accurate be made u&s;e of.</P>
<P><PB N="468" REF="447">
The&s;e two Fundamentals concerning the true Figure and Shape of the
Earth, and likewi&s;e of its Magnitude being acquir'd, it remains in the next
place to find out &s;ome means to di&s;tingui&s;h every Point or Part of the Surface
of this Globular Body in re&s;pect of any other; we are therefore to inquire
what helps are to be found that are u&s;eful for this purpo&s;e: For upon the
Surface of a perfect Sphaerical Body, there is no one point but has the very
&s;ame Re&s;pect to the whole Surface thereof, that any other Point hath; as
&s;uppo&s;e the Sphaerical Body were of Chry&s;tal or Gla&s;s perfectly Poli&s;h'd and
Uniform, no one Point has any Mark or Characteri&s;tick to di&s;tingui&s;h from
any other, and a Point being once lo&s;t, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to find the &s;ame again,
tho' it be turn'd a thou&s;and times; becau&s;e there is &s;uppos'd to be no one
Point of it that differs from any other, and they cannot be di&s;tingui&s;h'd
or mea&s;ur'd from, and every point may be &s;aid to be the middle of the whole
Circumference; and thence it is that the People of every Country and Place
have thought them&s;elves to be in the middle of the Earth, and all the Neigh|bouring
Ambient Countries to lie towards the Extremities. Which Opini|on
always hath and always will po&s;&s;e&s;s the Minds of ignorant People, 'till by
Learning and Art they are better inform'd; for &s;eeing an exten&s;ion of Land
or Seas round about them on every &s;ide, and &s;eeing the Sky whelm'd over
them like a Di&s;h or Hemi&s;phere, the middle of which &s;eems to be ju&s;t over
their Heads, and the Brims to touch the Earth and Seas at a great di&s;tance,
they cannot without much thinking and con&s;idering (which few People care
to do, e&s;pecially in matters which they think not of immediate concern) they
cannot chu&s;e but be impos'd on by the appearance to their Sen&s;e, which &s;eems
&s;o to repre&s;ent it; and if &s;o at Land, much more does it appear &s;o on the Sea
where there is no &s;ight of Land, when the Superficial Parts of the Sphaerical
Surface have no remaining vi&s;ible marks more than the Chry&s;tal Ball. On
the Land indeed, and in &s;ight of Land there are many obvious helps to find
and di&s;tingui&s;h one place from another, and the Po&s;itions of one from all the
other that are vi&s;ible and acce&s;&s;ible, as Hills, Vales, Mountains, Woods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
But the Surface of the Sea wants all tho&s;e, and has nothing but a fluctuating
changing Surface, which way &s;oever you look 'tis all alike, you know not
which way you go forwards or backwards, whether the Wind blows for you
or again&s;t you, or the Current &s;ets you near to or further from your Port;
which was the cau&s;e why the Antients never dur&s;t venture out of the &s;ight of
Land but went along the Shores, they being not then able to di&s;tingui&s;h, e|&s;pecially
in cloudy or clo&s;e Weather, which way lay the Quarters of the Earth
or Azymuth. And indeed before A&s;tronomy was known, the very Quarters
of the Wind were not di&s;tingui&s;h'd with re&s;pect to the Heaven's, but only
with re&s;pect to the Countries from whence they &s;eem'd to come. Thence we
find that they call'd one <HI>Vulturnus,</HI> another <HI>Phaenicius,</HI> a third <HI>Africus, Olym|pius,
Thracius, Helle&s;pontius,</HI> and the like, which were the Names of the Coun|tries
from whence they &s;eem'd to come.</P>
<P>But the Diligence and Inqui&s;itivene&s;s of &s;ucceeding Ages has furni&s;h'd us
with better and more univer&s;al ways or di&s;tingui&s;hing and naming the Quar|ters
of the Winds, or the Azymuthes, or Divi&s;ions of the Horizon, and Po&s;i|tions
of the Parts of the Surface of the Earth, and not only &s;o, but of determi|ning
the di&s;tance of any place from the Points certainly fix'd upon this
Globe of the Earth.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore in the next place con&s;ider what means there are hitherto
found and made u&s;e of for dividing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the ways yet known to di&s;cover the place of a Ship at Sea.</NOTE> and di&s;tingui&s;hing, and defining of the

Point of the Surface of it, from any other determin'd, whether upon Land or

middle part between the&s;e two are call'd the Meridional, and the Polar,
which is either North or South; and then an imaginary &s;traight Line &s;up|pos'd
drawn between them either upon the Earth, or in the Heavens, is cal|l'd
the Meridian of that place where this Suppo&s;ition is made.</P>
<P>Now that end of this North or South Line which goes towards that Quar|ter
of the Heaven where the Star is in the extreamity of the Tail of the lit|tle
Bear, near which is the Polar Point in the Heavens, is call'd the North,
and the other end is call'd the South. Now, one or the other of the&s;e is al|ways
vi&s;ible both at Land and Sea in all parts of the Globe in a clear Night;
but the Polar Points of the Earth, either in the North or South, have not
yet been difcover'd.</P>
<P>This North and South Line then is di&s;coverable by means of the Heavens
in every point of the Surface of the Earth, and by means of that, the Po&s;i|tion
of Places with re&s;pect to them, is ea&s;ily known, and thence al&s;o all the
other Quarters or Parts of the Horizon of any Place are ea&s;ily di&s;cover'd;
for a Line imagin'd drawn in the Plain of the Horizon through any place,
cutting the former Line at right Angles, points out in the Limb of the Ho|rizon,
the Ea&s;t and We&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="470" REF="449">
The&s;e two Lines di&s;tingui&s;h the Horizon or vi&s;ible Limb of the Heavens
into four equal Quarters or Quadrants, <HI>viz.</HI> The fir&s;t between the North and
Ea&s;t; the &s;econd between the Ea&s;t and South; the third between the South
and We&s;t; and the fourth between the We&s;t and North. Now each of the&s;e
Quadrants may be and u&s;ually are &s;ubdivided into le&s;&s;er Divi&s;ions. The Sea|men
generally content them&s;elves in Steerings and taking Bearings, with a
Divi&s;ion of each of the&s;e into eight parts, &s;o that the whole Horizon is di|vided
into thirty two Parts, which they call Points, becau&s;e they are pointed
out by their Compa&s;s or Winds, becau&s;e of their taking notice in which of
tho&s;e Points the Winds blow; the fir&s;t are the principal Points, <HI>viz.</HI> N. S.
E. W., the Lines that divide the&s;e four Quadrants in half are the half Winds
or Points, namely, NE. SE. SW. NW.; the eight Points in the middle of
the&s;e are the Quarter Winds, <HI>viz.</HI> NNE. ENE. ESE. SSE. SSW. WSW.
WNW. NNW. all the&s;e together make &s;ixteen, and the&s;e being again &s;ub|divided
into halves make &s;ixteen more, which are the by Winds, <HI>viz.</HI> N. b E.

N. E b E. S. W. b. S. S. W. b W. The&s;e again they do &s;ubdivive into four
Parts in their Accounts ca&s;t up, or protraction of their Cour&s;e. A&s;tronomo|ers
divide the Circuit of Horizon as they do all other, into Degrees, Mi|nutes,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> And &s;o do Mariners in ob&s;ervations of Amplitudes and Varia|tions
of the Compa&s;s, tho' not in the Bearings of Lands and I&s;lands.</P>
<P>Now, thus far the Heavens only &s;erve for determining the Po&s;ition of any
Place what&s;oever, with re&s;pect to the bearing of tho&s;e Polar Points of the
Earth I but now mention'd, but &s;hew not at all how far they are remov'd or
di&s;tant from either of tho&s;e Points. This al&s;o the Magnetical Needle or
Compa&s;s does in part di&s;cover, but not wholly without Rectification by the
help of the Heavens, as I &s;hall, in its proper place, explain. But this does
little as to its determining the po&s;itive Point of this Place upon the Surface
of this Globe, but only by the account of the Cour&s;e Sail'd, 'tis known-pretty
near which way the Place lies, from whence the departure is made, and
which way the Cour&s;e lies to the Place bound to. Some further information
therefore is requi&s;ite to determine the di&s;tance from the&s;e Polar Points, or
from an imaginary Circle incompa&s;&s;ing the Globe, lying at equal di&s;tance
be|tween
them, call'd the Aeauinoctial-Line, or more commonly the Line; of
which I &s;hall &s;peak more hereafter.</P>
<P>This then the Heavens afford an help for, namely, by their Po&s;ition or
height above the Horizon, or the vi&s;ible Limb of the Sky which &s;eemeth to
touch the Earth; but before I &s;peak of this I &s;hall a little further explain the
true notion of the Horizon.</P>
<P>The Horizon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the true no|tion of the Ho|rizon.</NOTE> or, as the Seamen call it, the Ori&s;on, at Sea is the extream
edges of the Sea which the Sky &s;eems to touch, which, in clear Weather, is
very ea&s;y to be &s;een in the Day-time, like a black Line bounding the Sky, and
may be al&s;o plainly enough di&s;cover'd in a very clear Star-light-Night, e&s;pe|cially
when the Moon is pretty well inlighten'd, or in the time of the Twi|light,
when as yet the Stars are very vi&s;ible; but when the Air is thick and
hazy, tho' the Sun, Moon, or Stars may be di&s;cover'd when they are a
pretty way above it, yet the Horizon cannot be di&s;tingui&s;h'd, but the Sea
and Sky gradually mix with one another, &s;o as no Ob&s;ervation can then be
made of it, there being no di&s;tinct vi&s;ible &s;eparation.</P>
<P>This vi&s;ible edge of the Sea is nearer or further off, according as the Eye
that &s;ees it is nearer to, or higher from the level Surface of the Sea; the pro|portions
of which one to the other I hinted the la&s;t time, but &s;hall now &s;ome|what
farther explain.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ible Horizon Mathematically con&s;ider'd, is an imaginary Plain
touching the Globe of the Earth or Sea in any Place or Point thereof, which
is to be con&s;ider'd; and this Plain is &s;uppos'd to be extended to the extrea|mities
of the univer&s;e every way; &s;o that when any Star or Caele&s;tial Body
on the Ea&s;tern &s;ide of the Meridian appears in the Plain thereof, it is Ri&s;ing,
and when they appear in the We&s;tern &s;ide thereof, they are Setting; or ac|cording
to the Copernican Hypothe&s;is, the Horizon is an imaginary indefi|nite
Plain, touching the Globe of the Earth at the place de&s;ign'd, which,
<PB N="471" REF="450">
together with the motion of the Globe, is carry'd round once in a Day, and
&s;o twice in that time pa&s;&s;es over the Caele&s;tial Bodies that lie in its Zone; when
the Ea&s;ter-mo&s;t &s;ide pa&s;&s;es them, they are &s;aid to be Ri&s;ing, and when the
We&s;ter-mo&s;t, they are &s;aid to be Setting, both which Hypothe&s;is equally
&s;olve the Phaenomena; and upon this &s;peculative notion of the Horizon,
there is al&s;o &s;uppos'd a Rational Horizon, which is al&s;o an imaginary indefi|nite
Plain pa&s;&s;ing through the Center of the Earth, and parallel to the former,
namely, at the di&s;tance of the Semidiameter of the Earth; which di&s;tance
being extended to the &s;ixt Stars, becomes wholly in&s;en&s;ible, being view'd
from the Earth, and &s;o as to them, and even to the Planets &s;uperior or far|ther
di&s;tant from us than the Sun, they become wholly the &s;ame, and the &s;en|&s;ible
and rational Horizon are one and the &s;ame imaginary Plain or Circle in
the Heavens; but in the Moon e&s;pecially, and in the Planets nearer to us
than the Sun, they are, by curious and nice Ob&s;ervation, &s;ometimes di&s;co|verable:
But tho&s;e Speculations more concern A&s;tronomy, than Geography
or Navigation, and therefore I &s;hall &s;ay no more of them at pre&s;ent, but ra|ther
&s;peak of a third Horizon, which is a real and vi&s;ible Circle, and that
which Navigators call the Ori&s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ible Horizon, as it concerns Navigation, is not a Plain, nor a
Sphaerical, nor Conical Surface, but rather an imaginary <HI>conoeidical</HI> Surface
touching the Sphaerical Surface of the Sea in a Circle, which Circle is nearer
or farther off from the Eye, which is in the Apex of the Conoeid, according
as the Eye is lower or higher rais'd into the Air above the Surface of the Sea,
and according as the inflective quality of the Air is le&s;s or greater; and from
the &s;ame cau&s;es that the di&s;tance thereof from the Eye is dimini&s;h'd or aug|mented,
does the imaginary Limits or Ba&s;e of it, which is a Circle in the
Heavens, de&s;cend lower and lower below the Rational, or notionally &s;en&s;ible
Horizontal Line, or imaginary Circle in the Heavens. This is a third Hori|zon
differing from both the other, and below them both in the Heavens; &s;o
that to the Ea&s;twards the Stars and Planets appear to have pa&s;s'd the Nauti|cal
or Mariners Ori&s;on &s;ome time before they arrive at the Speculative or No|tional
Horizons, and in the We&s;t they have pa&s;s'd the Notional Horizons
&s;ome time before they touch or arrive at the Nautical and Vi&s;ible Ori&s;on. So
that all tho&s;e Ob&s;ervations which are made at Sea, either for finding the
Azymuths, or for di&s;covering the variation of the Compa&s;s, or for Altitudes,
or the like, are every one of them Erroneous, and there ought to be a recti|fying
thereof made: For, Fir&s;t, How much the &s;aid Line appears below
the true Level or Tangent Line of the place, by &s;o much le&s;s is the Altitude
of the Caele&s;tial Body taken from it, than what it is taken at; and the Ampli|tudes
in an Oblique Sphere will thereby al&s;o be con&s;iderably augmented more
than what they &s;hould have been by the common Theory of the Sphere, Cal|culating
as from a true Horizon; for all the Geometrical Rules that are made
concerning the Notional Horizons; are produc'd from the con&s;ideration of
the Globe, and of the Proprieties and Affections thereof, and of Plains either
pa&s;&s;ing through the Center, or touching the &s;uperficies, and from the Hypo|the&s;is
that the Rays of Light pa&s;s in &s;traight Lines from the Caele&s;tial Body
to any Point of the Surface of the Earth, in which they &s;uppo&s;e the Eye of
the Ob&s;erver to be plac'd; but becau&s;e the Eye is never known to be exactly
in the Superficies of the Surface of the Sea, but at &s;ome height above it;
therefore the vi&s;ible Orizon of the Navigator, if the Rays of Light were
&s;traight, would be a Conical Surface, and not a plain; and the higher the
Eye is rais'd the &s;harper will be the Cone. But becau&s;e the Rays of Light
are not really &s;$raight in their pa&s;&s;age through the upper and lower parts of
the Atmo&s;phere, but are by the Inflection of the unequal Den&s;ity of the parts
of that Medium inflected into Curves, who&s;e Concave &s;ide is towards the
Earth, therefore the Superficies of every vi&s;ible Orizon is not a Conical, but
a Conoeidical Surface, in the Apex of which is plac'd the Eye aud the edge
of the Sea, which is a Circle upon it, the Center of which is in the Perpen|dicular
below the Eye, and thereof is very near as much below the Surface
of the Sea under the Eye, as the Eye is rais'd above it; and as this Orizon
on the Earth is a le&s;&s;er Circle, and not a greater Circle, &s;o the Ba&s;is of this
<PB N="472" REF="451">
Conoeidical Body, in the Heavens is not a great Circle, as is the Rational
Horizon, but a le&s;&s;er parall$$ Circle below it, and that &s;o much the more
below it, as the Eye is higher, elevated above the Surfaces of the Sea, and
as the inflective quality of the Air is greater.</P>
<P>Now, if we fir&s;t con&s;ider the Rays of Light as &s;traight Lines, we &s;hall
find the Angles of the &s;everal Conical Superficies adapted to the &s;everal heights
of the Eye, as I have already mention'd, and thence the di&s;tance of Objects
may be ghe&s;s'd where they are di&s;coverable; but that which I here men|tion
it for is in order to find the true Situation of any place upon the Sea, in
re&s;pect of the two Polar Points where no Land is di&s;coverable, which I
&s;hall next &s;hew you is di&s;coverable by the Heavens, by knowing the height of
the Caele&s;tial Bodies above the true Plain of the Horizon, or as Navigators
commonly above the Line, they call the Ori&s;on. And I have been &s;omewhat
the longer upon this Di&s;cour&s;e of the Ori&s;on, becau&s;e it &s;eems to be the
Foundation of all the Caele&s;tial Ob&s;ervations that are made at Sea, and if
that be Erroneous, then all the Ob&s;ervations will be &s;o too. It will there|fore
be nece&s;&s;ary to have the true Theory thereof, both for Latitudes and
Amplitudes, or Azymuths; I &s;hall therefore add one Ob&s;ervation concerning
the Mariners Ori&s;on, and &s;o conclude this pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The Ob&s;ervation then is this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whence the Looming or Glaring of the Sea.</NOTE> That there are &s;ome Con&s;titutions of the
Air, near the Surface of the Sea, that do really elevate the Ori&s;on above the
true Horizon or Level-line, and that is at &s;uch times as the Sea is &s;aid by the
Sea-men to <HI>Loom</HI> and <HI>Glare,</HI> as if it were Smooth'd and Poli&s;h'd, whereby
the Surface of the Sea &s;eems to be lifted up above its own level Surface into
the Atmo&s;phere incompa&s;&s;ing it: And this I have often taken notice of, and
as near as I could ghe&s;s from what Ob&s;ervations I was able to make; I judge
it to proceed from a den&s;e, and, as it were, foggy Air which lieth equally
&s;pread upon the Surface of the Sea, not extending above ten or twelve Foot,
or there about, above the &s;ame, and there terminating in a kind of Level,
the Air above it being perfectly clear and tran&s;parent, but this under Air
having a Foggine&s;s or Hazine&s;s in it, nothing can be &s;een through it but on|ly
what appears above it; &s;o that at a di&s;tance (tho' nothing of it can be
perceiv'd at the Ship) it appears to coale&s;ce with the very Sea, and the Sur|face
of this &s;eems to be the Surface of the Water; &s;o that by this means
the Mariners Ori&s;on in&s;tead of being below the true Horizon, is really rais'd
above it; and con&s;equently Altitudes taken from that will be too low, and
additions ought to be made to the Altitudes found, to bring them nearer to
the true Horizon. Now, how to rectify this and the other Irregularities of
the Ori&s;on, I &s;hall &s;ome other time give an account.</P>

<P>WHat I have farther to add,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Stand|ard of Mea&s;ure propos'd.</NOTE> as to the finding a Natural Univer&s;al Stand|ard
for Mea&s;ure, is a Conception of my own, of a way differing from
any other way what&s;oever that I have ever heard of, which, I conceive will
afford a Natural Standard for Weight and Mea&s;ure at all times, and in all
places, and which, I conceive, will not be very difficult to perform, if trial
be made with convenient Care and Accuratene&s;s; not that I pretend to di&s;|cover
any new Thing or Propriety which none have ever ob&s;erv'd before, no,
'tis that which all &s;ee and all know, and as trivial as the, pendulous vibrating
Motion, which, in Contempt, hath been call'd Swing Swangs, tho' the Ap|plication

<P><PB N="473" REF="452">
It is I doubt not &s;uffciently known to all pre&s;ent, that all fluid Bodies what|&s;oever
from the <HI>Homogeneity</HI> of their Texture and <HI>Heterogeneity</HI> to the in|compa&s;&s;ing
fluid <HI>Medium,</HI> have a power of Conglobation or forming them|&s;elves,
when in &s;mall parcels into Globular Bodies, and that the &s;maller they are
and the le&s;s difference of weight, the nearer they approach to a perfect Glo|bular
Figure, and the bigger and more differing the contained, and contain|ing
Fluids are, the more doth the form of the contain'd differ from that per|fect
Sphaerical Figure, and there is one certain quantity of every &s;imple Fluid,
which, in &s;ome certain <HI>Medium,</HI> will make the Conglobated Figure to be
flatted or ovall'd; &s;o that the longer Diameter to the &s;horter &s;hall bear a
certain a&s;&s;ign'd proportion; for in&s;tance, to take the mo&s;t remarkable, name|ly,
2. to 1. I conceive then, that this quantity being certainly found, and
mo&s;t accurately mea&s;ur'd, will afford a natural and perpetual Standard of mea|&s;ure;
for in&s;tance, let <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> perfectly depurated, and <HI>Rain,</HI> or <HI>Di&s;till'd
Water</HI> be the two Fluids; I &s;ay, there is a certain quantity of <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI>
which, in &s;uch <HI>Water</HI> will be form'd into an ovall'd or flatted Body, &s;o that
the Horizontal Diameter to the Perpendicular &s;hall be as 2. to 1. This longer
Diameter I make a Primitive and Natural Standard of length, and the weight
of this Body of <HI>Mercury</HI> &s;o ovall'd, I make the Primitive Sandard for Weight;
the &s;ame may be done with any other Fluid.</P>
<P>This may be al&s;o done by purely refin'd <HI>Gold</HI> or <HI>Silver,</HI> who&s;e Purity may
be found by the proportion of weight it beareth to Rain-water; for if a
certain quantity of Gold be melted and pour'd out upon a perfectly &s;mooth
and horizontal Surface of a Stone, this will form it&s;elf into an Oval Body,
who&s;e Horizontal Diameter to the Perpendicular, will be as 2. to 1.</P>
<P>The &s;ame may be done with any other Metal be&s;ides Gold, but only we
cannot be &s;o &s;ure of the purity and unmixedne&s;s of the Metal, as we may
be of Gold.</P>

<P>That which I &s;hall acquaint you with at pre&s;ent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great u&s;e of the Suns Rays let into a dark Room.</NOTE> is an Experiment or Me|thod
rather, by which &s;everal very con&s;iderable Di&s;coveries may be made
both in Nature and Art. It is, in &s;hort, a way of contracting a very con&s;i|derable
quantity of the Rays of the Sun into a very &s;mall Point or Space, the
&s;maller the better, from which they i&s;&s;uing again with great Brightne&s;s and

Rays &s;uffer in their way, to de&s;cribe upon a &s;mooth, white plain the true &s;hape
of the Body interpos'd between that radiating Point, and that &s;mooth ex|panded
white Plain. This in it&s;elf is very plain and obvious, and is very lit|tle
differing from the way now commonly known, it being no other than the
fitly placing one or two Convex Gla&s;&s;es again&s;t an hole cut in the Shutter of
the Window of a darkn'd Room, &s;o as that the Rays of the Sun may pa&s;s in
through the &s;ame directly and be collected into a Focus, and from thence a|gain
&s;pread and diverge into the Room, &s;o to as be ca&s;t upon the Table afore|&s;aid.
The Experiment it&s;elf, tho' I cannot now exhibit, yet there are &s;ever|al

at convenient di&s;tance, as that of a Man's Head, Face, Hands, or Body,
in which it is &s;o curious, that every Hair that appears without the &s;olid part of
the Head, Hand, or Body, is truly repre&s;ented in its Place and Magnitude.</P>
<P>By this the out-lines of Birds, Bea&s;ts, Shells, Fi&s;hes may be taken: As

&s;everal Matters relating to the former Subject of Navigation; there is in
the beginning a Repitition of &s;ome things formerly treated of, which could not well
be &s;truck out, without breaking the thread of the Di&s;cour&s;e; and the mo&s;t part of the
Author's Treati&s;es in this Volume, being Lectures read at &s;everal times, it was
nece&s;&s;ary for him to make &s;ome Repetition of what had been before &s;aid for the better
under&s;tanding of what was to follow; nor could they have been omitted here without
a nem Modelling and Epitomizing the whole, which made me rather tre&s;pa&s;s upon
the Reader's Patience, than attempt to Alter or Abridge any thing of the Author's
Sen&s;e; and indeed I thought it more advi&s;able to give them as he left them, than ad|venture
upon &s;uch an undertaking.</P>
<P>This treats fir&s;t of the Nature and Generation of a Globular Figure and its Pro|prieties.
Of the Circles of the Terre&s;trial Globe. Of the Prime Meridian. Of the
Parallels. Whether the Perpendiculars re&s;pe&s;t the Earths Center. Of the Variation,
and its unfitne&s;s for finding the Longitude. Of the change of the Latitude
and Longitude of Places. Why the Circles have been divided into three hundred
and &s;ixty Degrees. Of the difference between the Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern Literati. A
new Duodecimal Progre&s;&s;ion propos'd. Several Maxims laid down, and &s;everal ways
for finding a true Meridian and the Latitude.</P>

<P>I Have, in &s;ome former Lectures in this place, explain'd in general the Art
of Navigation, &s;hewing by what Helps and Methods, and from what
Principles the Navigator may be able to direct his Cour&s;e through the Ocean
to the place de&s;ign'd, and at any time to be able to know in what part of
the Sea his Ve&s;&s;el is Sailing.</P>
<P>For the performing of which I &s;hew'd in general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Requi&s;ites for a Navigator</NOTE> that it was requi&s;ite that
our Navigator &s;hould, Fir&s;t, Be very well skill'd in Geography, or the true
de&s;cription of the Earth and Sea, upon the Surface of which he is to make
and compute his Cour&s;e. And, Secondly, That he &s;hould be very knowing
in all tho&s;e Particulars, which may &s;erve him for Marks or Directions to know
and di&s;tingui&s;h the Parts one from another.</P>
<P>In order to under&s;tand the de&s;cription of the Earth more effectually for this
purpo&s;e, it will be requi&s;ite to determine,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Four things to be determin'd.</NOTE> The Figure of the Body of the Earth, and the &s;everal Proprieties
belonging to that Figure, that &s;o we may the better be able to comprehend
the difference between a curve and a plain Superficies, and what Lines will be
u&s;eful to be drawn or &s;uppos'd on it, and from the knowledge of tho&s;e be
the better able to find and determine,</P>
<P>In the Second place, the Magnitude of this Body by known Mea&s;ures,<MILESTONE N="2">
and to examine and prove the Ways and Methods of mea&s;uring the &s;ame;
both &s;uch as have been already either experimented or invented, and &s;uch o|thers
as may be thought of or try'd for the future; for upon a true know|ledge
of the&s;e two are founded all the other Super&s;tructures in this Art; the&s;e
two cannot be truly and exactly obtain'd without a clear knowledge.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Of the motions of this Body, and what Effects are thereby pro|duc'd<MILESTONE N="3">
pertinent to this purpo&s;e, namely, what Circular and other Lines are
thereby de&s;ign'd, and ought to be under&s;tood on the Surface of the Earth.</P>
<P>The motions of this Body are either Total or Partial; the Total are,
Fir&s;t, Gravitation. Secondly, Magneti&s;me. Thirdly, Rotation upon its
own Axis. Fourthly, Circumvolutation about the Sun Excentrically. Fifth|ly,
Men&s;trual, Cycloeidation or Undulation. Sixthly, Libration. The
Partial are either of the Water or Air; of the Water are, Fir&s;t, The ge|neral
motion of the Seas, as, Fir&s;t, Currents. Secondly, The Tides, or of
Rivers running into the Seas. Of the Air are either con&s;tant, or, Secondly,
<PB N="476" REF="455">
The uncertain Winds, and both of them either Moderate or Exce&s;&s;ive all
which ought, as near as may be, to be brought to a Standard of Men&s;uration,
without which all the Art we hitherto know or make u&s;e of, will not &s;ufficient|ly
inable us to keep a true Reckoning or Account of the Ships way in pa&s;&s;ing
or cro&s;&s;ing the Seas, or how we change our Situation Ea&s;tward or We&s;tward,
e&s;pecially in re&s;pect of the fix'd parts of the Earth; for 'tis one thing to
mea&s;ure our way through the Superficial Parts of the Body of the Water in
which we float, and another thing to know how great a part, and upon what
Point or Azymuth we have pa&s;s'd over the Earth at the bottom of the Sea;
the parts of the Earth at the bottom remaining fix'd and &s;teady, but the
Water of the Sea being carry'd various ways, and with differing Velocity over
the &s;ame, in &s;everal parts of it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4">Fourthly, The differing Sub&s;tances of which the Superficial Parts of this
Body con&s;i&s;ts, as of Earth, Water, Air, and the &s;everal Extents, Bounda|ries,

<P>Having already treated in the foregoing Lectures of the &s;everal Opinions
touching the true form of the Earth, I &s;hall not now repeat any of them
here, but proceed to &s;hew &s;everal other Properties thereof nece&s;&s;ary to be
known, in order to the better under&s;tanding the Subject in Hand, <HI>The Art of
Navigation;</HI> and, in the fir&s;t place,</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing it, as 'tis believ'd by mo&s;t, tho' prov'd by none, to be of a per|fect
Globular Figure, and con&s;equently the Surface of the Sea, as well
as that of the Land, to be Sphaerical, we will in the next place proceed to
con&s;ider of the Proprieties of this Body, becau&s;e 'tis upon the Surface of
this Body that all our Voyages and Men&s;urations are to be made and not
upon a Plain; for tho' the level or the Sea doth, to a vulgar Eye, &s;eem to be
a Plain, and generally mo&s;t common People do believe or &s;uppo&s;e it to be &s;o,
yet 'tis pa&s;t di&s;pute that it is Sphaeroeidical, and has a Curviture an&s;wer|able
to the Curvity of the Superficies of the Earth, tho' it be not &s;o ea&s;ily
found by the pro&s;pect of the naked Eye.</P>
<P>And that we may the better find out and examine the Properties thereof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The properties of a Globular Figure.</NOTE>
it will be &s;it to con&s;ider how a Sphaerical or Globular Figure is generated. I
need not premi&s;e either Definition, Po&s;tulata or Axioms for this Explication,
becau&s;e &s;o much, as I have here occa&s;ion to mention, will be ea&s;ily enough un|der&s;tood
without them, and common words of Expre&s;&s;ion will be &s;ignificant
and defin'd enough for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>A Sphaerical or Globular Superficies may be conceiv'd to be generated by
the Conver&s;ion and whole Revolution of a Semiperiphery upon its Diameter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Globular Su|perficies how generated.</NOTE>
and a Globular Body may be conceiv'd, generated by a whole Revolution of
a Semicircle upon its Diameter: As, let ACB repre&s;ent a Diameter bi&s;ect|ed
at C, and upon the Center C, and distance AC. Let ADB repre&s;ent a
Semiperiphery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Table <HI>IX.</HI> Fig. 6.</NOTE> every Point of which is equally di&s;tant from the Center C;
&s;uppo&s;e then this Periphery to be revolv'd round upon the Diameter AB
remaining fix'd, this Periphery &s;hall de&s;cribe a Globular or Sphaerical Super|ficies,
every Point of which Superficies &s;hall be equally di&s;tant from the Cen|ter
C; for &s;ince the Sphaerical Superficies is de&s;crib'd by the Rotation of the
Periphery ADB, no one Point of it can be further from, or nearer to the
Center C, than any one Point of the Semiperiphery ADB; but every Point
of the Semiperiphery ADB is equally di&s;tant from the Center C; therefore e|very
Point of the whole Sphaerical Surface &s;o generated, is equally di&s;tant
from the Center C; this di&s;tance is always equal to the Semidiameter of the
Periphery, <HI>viz.</HI> AC, or CB.</P>
<P><PB N="477" REF="456">
Next by this Rotation upon the Diameter AB, every Point in the Semipe|riphery<MILESTONE N="2">
ADB will de&s;cribe a Circle in the Spherical Surface: All which Cir|cles
are parallel to each other; for &s;ince that any two of them are de&s;crib'd
by two Points of the Semiperiphaery, which two Points retain the &s;ame di|&s;tance
or place in the Semiperiphery for the whole Revolution, and that
That di&s;tance is the &s;horte&s;t that can be mea&s;ur'd upon the Sphaerical Sur|face,
it follows that any two of them will be parallel, and &s;ince one of the
two may always be one and the &s;ame Circle, and any other Circle may be the
other, it follows that all the&s;e Circles, &s;o de&s;crib'd, will be parallel to each
other</P>
<P>Thirdly, &s;uppo&s;ing from any number of Points, as EEE, how many &s;o|ever<MILESTONE N="3">
Perpendiculars, let fall or drawn to the Diameter AB, as EF, EF, EF,
which will therefore be parallel to each other, becau&s;e they are all Perpendi|cular
to the &s;ame Line, and in the &s;ame plain of the Semicircle ADB: By the
Rotation of the Semicircle ADB; every one of the Lines EF, EF, DC, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
will, de&s;cribe a Circular Plain, and every one of the&s;e Plains will have its Center
in the Line AB. Thirdly, Every one of tho&s;e Plains will be parallel to each
other, becau&s;e the Lines de&s;cribing them are parallel to each other, becau&s;e
they are at right Angles with the Axis, therefore the imaginary Superficies
de&s;crib'd by them, is a Plain. Next,</P>
<P>Fourthly, The Diameter AB will be Perpendicular to each of tho&s;e Plains<MILESTONE N="4">
and will pa&s;s the Plain in the Center thereof.</P>
<P>Fifthly, The&s;e Plains will be bigger and bigger the, nearer the Perpendi|cular<MILESTONE N="5">
that, de&s;cribes them, is to the Center C; and the bigge&s;t of all will be
that de&s;crib'd by DC, that being the longe&s;t Perpendicular; and becau&s;e
DC is equal to AC, therefore the Circles de&s;crib'd by tho&s;e as Radii, &s;hall be
equal, that is, ADB, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Circle de&s;crib'd by the Rotation of DC;
therefore the&s;e Circles &s;hall be great Circles, therefore great Circles &s;hall di|vide
the Sphaerical Superficies into two equal Parts, becau&s;e AD is equal to DB,
and con&s;equently the Sphaerical Surfaces de&s;crib'd by the Rotation of them.
Therefore all great Circles upon a Globe are equal to one another; and be|cau&s;e
ADB is half a great Circle, the Points whereof A and B remain, fix'd,
whil&s;t the Simiperiphery is revolv'd round; and &s;o the &s;ame will pa&s;s through
every Point of the Sphaerical Surface de&s;crib'd by it, all which concur in the
Points A and B; therefore all tho&s;e great Circles do bi&s;ect each other in the
Points A and B: Therefore all the le&s;&s;er parallel Peripheries cut the&s;e great
Circles at right Angles, and are all bi&s;ected by them: therefore the Plains
of the le&s;&s;er Circles are at right Angles with the Plain of the great Circles
that bi&s;ect them; therefore the Angles made by any two Po&s;itions of the Se|micircle
at the Axis of its motion, make equal Angles in all the parallel Cir|cles
and equal parts of Arches in all the Peripheries of them.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e the Center C may be &s;uppo'd to remain fix'd, and the Points A
and B may be &s;uppos'd fix'd in any other two oppo&s;ite Points of the Sphaerical
Surface already de&s;crib'd, as X and Y and the Semiperiphery ADB may be &s;up|pos'd
revolv'd upon tho&s;e Points or Poles as AB upon the Axis ACB, therefore
this Revolution of XDY will de&s;cribe the &s;ame Sphaerical Surface with the for|mer,
which will de&s;cribe other great and le&s;&s;er Circles in it; all which will
have the &s;ame Re&s;pects and Proprieties to each other, as the former had a|mong
them&s;elves; therefore the Plains of all great Circles pa&s;s through the
Center, the Diameters of them being always equal to the Diameter of the
Sphaere; therefore all great Circles bi&s;ect each other; therefore the Plain of
all le&s;&s;er Circles cut or pa&s;s through the Globe be&s;ide the Center; therefore
all Plains pa&s;&s;ing through or cutting the Globe, cut it in Circles, and if
they pa&s;s through the Center cut it in great Circles, and if they pa&s;s be&s;ide
and not through the Center, cut it in le&s;&s;er Circles, therefore all le&s;&s;er Circles
are parallel to &s;ome great Circle, which is in the middle between the Poles
A and B; therefore the &s;ame Points that are the Poles of a great Circle, are
<PB N="478" REF="457">
the Poles al&s;o of the le&s;&s;er Circles that are parallel to it; therefore all Sphae|rical
Surfaces that inter&s;ect each other, do cut each other in the Periphery
of a Cricle, and con&s;equently in a Plain; therefore the Line drawn between
the Centers of two &s;uch interfering Globes &s;hall pa&s;s the Center of that Plain
at right Angles or Perpendicularly.</P>
<P>The&s;e Proprieties of a Globular Body and Sphaerical Surface, which follow as
Corollaries from the way of the Generation of them, and &s;o need little Ex|planation
for the evidencing the demon&s;tration of them, will be &s;ufficient at
pre&s;ent for the Explanation of &s;uch Divi&s;ions and imaginary Circular Lines
as have been made u&s;e of by Geographers, for the better De&s;cription, Limi|tation
and Divi&s;ion of the Superficial parts of this great Globe of the Earth;
as for the other kinds of Lines which are not Circular but Sphaerohelical, &s;uch
as the Rhumbs or Magnetical Lines, tho&s;e I &s;hall hereafter di&s;cour&s;e of in
their proper places, and explain all tho&s;e Proprieties which are peculiar to
them, and of u&s;e in Navigation.</P>
<P>Geographers then have repre&s;ented this great Globous Body of the Earth
by a great round Ball or Globe, who&s;e Surface is Sphaerical and Smooth, and
on the Surface of that they have de&s;crib'd the various parts of the Superficies
of the Earth bearing &s;uch Form, Po&s;ition, Magnitude and Variety one to
another, as the real parts of the Earth do one with another; and therein
have taken notice of the Po&s;ition, Shape, Magnitude and Boundaries of all
Lands, and Continents, I&s;lands, Penin&s;ulas, I&s;thmus's, Promonotories, Moun|tains,
Plains, De&s;erts, and other remarkable differences, as are known, of the
parts of the Earth which appear above the Water; as al&s;o of all the Boun|daries
and Extents of Oceans, Seas, Gulphs, Bays, Channels, Streights,
Lakes, Rivers, and the like; where the Water covereth the Face of the
Earth; as the be&s;t Di&s;coveries hitherto made, can furni&s;h them with the in|formation
of. The&s;e, I &s;ay, they have delineated and de&s;crib'd upon a Glo|bous
Body with what exactne&s;s and skill they are able; and tho' I conceive
it to be far from that fulne&s;s, exactne&s;s and truth of Repre&s;entation that is
to be wi&s;h'd; yet comparing what is now known and de&s;crib'd, with what
was known to the Antients, we &s;hall find more than a new World has been
of late Ages di&s;cover'd: And indeed the very World it&s;elf; for 'twas a
long time before it was known what the Figure or Magnitude of the Earth
was; and there was a time, when the beleif of Antipodes was accounted and
puni&s;h'd as a Here&s;y. Every one then believ'd his own Country to be the
middle of the Plain of the Earth, and that the utmo&s;t Limits of it, which
touch'd the Vault of Heaven, were the Sea, into which the Sun, Moon and
Stars de&s;cended when they Set, and out of which they a&s;cended again when
they Ro&s;e; and the utmo&s;t extent of Land &s;eem'd no more than what a
Conqueror was, in a little time, able to over run and vanqui&s;h.</P>
<P>It is hard t conceive,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earths Fi|gure fir&s;t found by the Greek Mathematici|ans.</NOTE> how Men from &s;uch a &s;tate of Ignorance &s;hould ar|rive
at &s;uch a degree of certainty of Knowledge, as the World has at pre&s;ent
attain'd; how they came to know that the Earth was a round or globular Bo|dy;
nor have we any Hi&s;tories that do inform us; but we fir&s;t met with it a|mong
the Mathematical Philo&s;ophres of the Greeks, who, 'tis probable,
from the curio&s;ity of their Caele&s;tial Ob&s;ervations, and from the &s;trictne&s;s of
their Arguing came to find and demon&s;trate the truth thereof; and then to in|deavour
to find out al&s;o the certain Magnitude and Mea&s;ure thereof by Ob|&s;ervations
and Men&s;urations purpo&s;ely made. The&s;e Caele&s;tical Ob&s;ervations,
I conceive, were the fir&s;t occa&s;ions of their di&s;covery of the true Form of the
Earth, and 'tis by means of tho&s;e that the Magnitude of it hath been, and
is to be truly di&s;cover'd, there being &s;o many unan&s;werable Objections again&s;t
all the other ways of attempting it, that I think it wholly impracticable to
any tolerable degree of certainty.</P>
<P>Caele&s;tial Objects then, 'tis probable, were the Marks that guided them to
this Di&s;covery, which were &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e, whether they were
&s;uppos'd to move round the Earth whil&s;t that was &s;uppos'd to &s;tand &s;till and
fix'd, or whether they were look'd on as fix'd and immoveable as to the Diur|nal
Motion; and the Earth it&s;elf, according to <HI>Ari&s;tarchus Samius,</HI> o$$ our
<PB N="479" REF="458">
late <HI>Copernicus,</HI> were &s;uppos'd to be whirl'd round upon an Axis once in twen|ty
four Hours.</P>
<P>Beofre the revival of this Opinion the Body of the Earth, tho' accounted
but a Point in re&s;pect of the expanded Univer&s;e, yet was it &s;uppos'd to be of
&s;uch a &s;olid, Den&s;e and &s;luggi&s;h Nature, as not to be mov'd out of its place or
po&s;ture, tho' the whole Univer&s;e, which was &s;o many Millions of Millions
of times bigger and more noble, was &s;uppos'd to whirle about it with an in|credible
Velocity, and all to wait and admini&s;ter to it; which yet at the &s;ame
time was &s;aid to be damn'd to the wor&s;t of places (as it was accounted) the
Center of the whole Creation, where it was affirm'd to the made up of the ve|ry
Dreggs and Dro&s;s of the <HI>Chaos,</HI> to which all the vile and ba&s;er parts of
the Univer&s;e continually de&s;cended, and was there excluded, as it were, and
thrown out of the very Communication of the re&s;t of the Creation. To
maintain this Opinion the whole Creation was &s;trangely Metamorphos'd, the
mo&s;t glorious Caele&s;tial Bodies were depriv'd of their greate&s;t Powers and the
be&s;t places of the Univer&s;e: Fir&s;t, For their Powers they were rarify'd al|mo&s;t
to be no Bodies, and &s;uppos'd more light and &s;pungy than Air it&s;elf;
and next they were wholly depriv'd of the Power of Motion, &s;o as to be
&s;uppos'd to be carry'd about by certain Orbs, in which they were &s;uppos'd
plac'd and in them to be only Pa&s;&s;ive and not Active at all; and thus as &s;it|ting
in Chariots to be whirl'd round this de&s;picable Point of the Earth, for
the more State and Pomp. On the other &s;ide to make this &s;eem more pro|bable,
the whole <HI>Expan&s;um</HI> or <HI>Aether</HI> was con&s;olidated into more than ada|mantine
Hardne&s;s and Tran&s;parency, and divided into Sphaeres or Orbs
within Orbs Concentrical, Excentrical, Progre&s;&s;ive, Retrograde, and together
with the&s;e qualities of Hardne&s;s and Tran&s;parency, there was added to this
Sub&s;tance that fill'd the Aethereal &s;pace &s;o great a &s;moothne&s;s, as that all the&s;e
Orbs could pa&s;s by each other without loo&s;ing any part of their motion by
rubbing, and &s;uch an impenetrability as not to wear out or wa&s;t each other by
Grinding or Fretting; and yet to heighten the wonder they were &s;uppos'd to
be Sonorous and Tonick, and to out-do all the Mu&s;ick be&s;ides in the World,
by the harmonious Melody of the Symphonick Sphaeres; which Harmony
yet was &s;o &s;ublime as not be to heard or under&s;tood by any but &s;uch as were
gone out of them&s;elves and had left tho&s;e Corporeal Sen&s;es which other Mor|tals
here make u&s;e of, behind them, and were tran&s;ported into an Ex&s;tacy of
Contemplation and Attention. By this contrivance the Univer&s;e was all
made &s;olid impenetrable, except only what &s;pace was left below the Con|cave
part of the Moon's Orbe, which Concave part was the in&s;ide of the
Walls of this Pri&s;on to which the Earth was condemned, beyond which no
Terre&s;tial Matter could penetrate, nor any Earthly Power reach; nor in|deed
could they reach &s;o far, becau&s;e this Concave Superficies was lin'd with a
very thick Coat of the Element of Fire which had Power to con&s;ume and
di&s;per&s;e all that which ri&s;ing from the Earth, or inferior Regions of the Air,
&s;hould attempt to invade and penetrate the Heavens. Thence Comets or
Blazing Stars were &s;uppos'd Sublunary and Aereal Meteors, and to be kindl'd
by this Guardian Element of the Fire, and by that to be variou&s;ly thrown from
place to place like other Meteors and falling Stars, retorting their ill influence
back again to the Earth from whence they were &s;ent; or like Squibbs and
Powder-Serpents drove to and fro by the blaze of their own Tail. Thus
former Artificers contriv'd the Heavens into Wheel-work, and &s;uppo&s;ing
them&s;elves to have e&s;tabli&s;h'd their Machinations by Suppo&s;itions, which freed
them from the fear of Di&s;covery or Contradiction they did a long while a|mu&s;e
the World with their Hypothe&s;es. But later A&s;tronomers finding, by
accurate Ob&s;ervations, that Comets did pervade all tho&s;e &s;paces which they
had fill'd up, began to di&s;cover their Fictions to be groundle&s;s, and &s;oon af|ter
found out a much more probable Solution of all the Phaenomena of the
Heavens, by placing the Sun in the Center of the Planetary Sy&s;tem$, and
in&s;tead of whirling round the Heavens once in twenty four Hours, they found
or believ'd at lea&s;t, that the Body of the Earth it&s;elf turning round upon one
of its Diameters as an Axis, caus'd all tho&s;e appearances of change, which
was formerly a&s;crib'd to the motions of the Heavens, &s;uppos'd to be caus&s;'d
<PB N="480" REF="459">
by the rapidity of the Sphaere call'd the <HI>Primum Mobile;</HI> but taking which
Suppo&s;ition we will, as to what principally concerns the di&s;tingui&s;hing of Lon|gitude
and Latitude in Geography, it will come much to the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>We &s;uppo&s;e then that the Earth is, by all common Ob&s;ervations, found to
be a round Body, and &s;uppos'd to be mov'd round upon two Points in its Sur|face
or upon an imaginary Axis or Diameter of it, and that it makes a whole
Revolution to the &s;ame Po&s;ition again in re&s;pect of the Plain through the Sun
once it twenty four Hours thereby making Night Day; and &s;uppo&s;ing an
imaginary Plain pa&s;&s;ing through the Center of the Sun and the two Polar
Points of this motion, this Plain will de&s;cribe upon the Surface of the Earth
every moment that it moves a great Circle, and &s;o in a Revolution infinite
of great Circles pa&s;&s;ing through the Polar Points and dividing the whole Sur|face
of the Earth into a Morning and Afternoon half; the Morning half will
be that which is moving towards the Sun, and the Evening half that which is
moving from it: The&s;e great Circles are call'd Meridians, becau&s;e when a|ny
Point of the Surface of the Earth comes by its motion into this Plain, the
Sun is in the Meridian of that place, and are u&s;ually drawn in Lines upon the
Globe which is made to repre&s;ent the Earth; but becau&s;e to draw them all
would perfectly cover the Surface of the Globe, there being no moment pa&s;|&s;ing
without an alteration of it in re&s;pect of the Superficial Parts of the Earth,
therefore on &s;maller Globes they u&s;ually draw but twelve of them, which di|vides
the whole Surface into twenty four parts an&s;werable to the Hours of
the Day and Night, but in greater Globes they treble that number an&s;wer|able
to every third part of an Hour or twenty Minutes of time.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e the&s;e imaginary Circles alter every moment, and all have the
&s;ame re&s;pect to the Heavens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the prime Meridian.</NOTE> &s;o that from thence there is no rea&s;on why
they &s;hould not be drawn over &s;ome places as well as others, that there
might be a certainty where to begin to number them; there hath been &s;ever|al
attempts or profers by &s;everal Authors to place under that which they call
their fir&s;t or beginning Meridian, this or that remarkable place of the Earth.
<HI>Ptolomy</HI> accounted his fir&s;t Meridian from one Degree We&s;t of the We&s;ter|mo&s;t
<HI>Fortunate I&s;lands</HI> or the <HI>Canarys,</HI> and thence accounted his Longitude or
di&s;tance Ea&s;tward, 'till he arriv'd to the Ea&s;ter-mo&s;t Border of <HI>China,</HI> &s;up|po&s;ing
thereby to have compris'd all the Habitable part of the World.</P>
<P>Upon the farther di&s;coveries of late times of Lands more to the We&s;tward
than the&s;e <HI>Canaries;</HI> &s;ome have taken the Meridian pa&s;&s;ing through the I&s;land
of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> one of the I&s;lands of <HI>Cape Verd.</HI> And <HI>Hondius</HI> has cho&s;en for
his fir&s;t Meridian that which pa&s;&s;es through the I&s;land of St. <HI>Jago;</HI> but <HI>Ger|rardus
Mercator</HI> has plac'd his fir&s;t Meridian over the I&s;land of <HI>Corvo,</HI> one of
the <HI>Azores,</HI> becau&s;e at that time the Magnetical Needle or Compa&s;s had no
variation from the true Meridian Line in that place, which he therefore
judg'd would be a very good mark to find it again in &s;ucceeding Ages: But
as there are other Meridians in which the Compa&s;s has no variation, &s;o it
has been &s;ince his time found that there is a variation of the variation of the
Magnetical Needle; and tho' the Needle then varied here at <HI>London</HI> to the
Ea&s;tward, yet &s;ince that time, <HI>viz.</HI> about thirty Years &s;ince, had no varia|tion
here at <HI>London,</HI> and is now very con&s;iderably gone towards the We&s;t.
Some others have made the fir&s;t Meridian that which pa&s;s'd by the mo&s;t Ea&s;t|wardly
part of <HI>Bra&s;ile; Arnoldus,</HI> and <HI>Wendelinus</HI> have cho&s;en the I&s;land of St.
<HI>Vincent</HI> for their fir&s;t Meridian; and <HI>Jodocus Hondius</HI> has taken the &s;ame in
his Globe making it pa&s;s through <HI>Iceland; Robert Dudley</HI> in his <HI>Arcano del

mo&s;t of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mapp makers, begin their reckoning from the Pike of
<HI>Teneriff.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> Geographers, by order of <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIIIth. in the Year
1634, plac'd their fir&s;t Meridian to pa&s;s through the I&s;land of <HI>Ferro</HI> one of
the <HI>Canaries,</HI> as is te&s;tify'd by <HI>Brietius</HI> in his Parallel between the Antient
and Modern Geography, much the &s;ame with that of <HI>Ptolomy.</HI> Another
prime Meridian was con&s;tituted by Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the fir&s;t, as a Boundary be|tween
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Divi&s;ion or Conque&s;t of the World, and that
was after a long Debate, but never any final Deci&s;ion or Determination &s;up|pos'd
to pa&s;s through the Mouth of the River of <HI>Amazons</HI> and that of <HI>De
<PB N="481" REF="460">
la Platta,</HI> as <HI>Langrenus</HI> has made it in his Mapp (which, whether they lie both
under one Meridian or not, no one yet knows) And the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were to be
proprietors of all Lands they di&s;cover'd to the We&s;twards of that Meridian,
and the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> all to the Ea&s;tward; but the&s;e two meeting each other in
the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> again, caus'd much Di&s;pute. However, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> keep the
<HI>Philippines,</HI> tho' it be thought to intrench upon the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> half. Other
Geographers have taken other beginnings, which has caus'd a very great Con|fu&s;ion,
in particular Geographical Mapps, it being difficult to know from
what prime Meridian they begin their Account.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, the A&s;tronomers have made choice of other Meridians for their
A&s;tronomical Calculations, as <HI>Ticho Brahe,</HI> and his followers, take the Meridi|an
of <HI>Vranibourg,</HI> being in <HI>Huena</HI> an I&s;land in the <HI>Sound. Origanus</HI> takes that
of <HI>Frankfort, Maginus</HI> that of <HI>Venetia, Eich&s;tadius</HI> that of <HI>Stettn,</HI> and indeed
almo&s;t every new Writer makes the Meridian of the place of his abode the
fir&s;t Meridian, and refers all the re&s;t to that, which breeds a great and need|le&s;s
Trouble and Confu&s;ion in Geography; and it were very much to be wi&s;h|ed
that they had, or would for the future agree upon &s;ome one to which all
might be refer'd. There is not yet found any very con&s;iderrble ground in
Nature why one &s;hould be agreed to rather than another; that of the di|rection
of the Magnetical Needle in the true Meridian Line would have look|ed
&s;o much like &s;uch an indication of Nature, if the Hypothe&s;is of <HI>Linton</HI>
and <HI>Nantonier</HI> had been true; but &s;ince Time has di&s;cover'd that tho&s;e were
but groundle&s;s Hypothe&s;es, that pretence is vain.</P>
<P>That of the prodigious high Mountain of the Pike of <HI>Tenariff,</HI> which <HI>Wil|liam
Bleaw</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> take notice of in their Charts, is likely enough to
be a la&s;ting Mark, and 'tis con&s;iderable enough to di&s;tingui&s;h it from all o|ther
Mountains yet known in the World; and lying conveniently in the
way of Shipping, may, for ought I know, be as proper as any other place
what&s;oever, provided all agree to make their Compute from it; and the com|puting
Ea&s;twards may &s;erve well enough &s;ince it is now generally us'd, but
had it been to be now e&s;tabli&s;h'd, I &s;hould think it had been much more ac|cording
to Nature to have computed the contrary way.</P>
<P>Next, the Earth being &s;uppos'd to be mov'd round upon this Axis, may
be &s;uppos'd to have infinite Circles de&s;crib'd upon the Surface of it, by the in|finite
Points of the great Circle that thus it moves round withal, which
will therefore be parallel to one another, becau&s;e all are de&s;crib'd by the &s;ame
motion upon the Axis; that Point of it which is in the middle between the
two Poles de&s;cribeth a great Circle, which is call'd the Aequator or Aequi|noctial
Line,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Parrl|les.</NOTE> and all the other Circles will be le&s;&s;er Circles, which being
parallel to it are call'd Parallels; all the&s;e Circles cro&s;s the former Meridi|ans
at right Angles, and &s;o every one of them are, by every one of the for|mer,
divided into two equal parts.</P>
<P>The&s;e parallel Circles are drawn upon the Globe that repre&s;ents the
Earth, but not all of them, for that would cover the whole &s;uperficies of
the Globe, but only &s;o many of them as may, together with the Meridians,
&s;erve to di&s;tingui&s;h and divide the Surface thereof into Trapezia of a conveni|nent
bigne&s;s, and are generally proportion'd to the number of Semimeri|dians,
<HI>viz.</HI> &s;o many between the Aequinoctial, and either Pole, as there are
Meridians, as at every Five, Ten, or Fifteen Degrees di&s;tance from the Ae|quinoctial
Circle, from which they begin to be accounted.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 13th. 84. I explain'd the la&s;t Day various Opinions concerning the Fi|gure
of the Earth on which we live, and &s;hew'd you why, tho' it has not
been &s;ufficiently prov'd by any Ob&s;ervations yet made, that it is po&s;itively
of this or that Figure, yet by comparing all together it &s;eems mo&s;t probable
that the Figure of it is Sphaerical or Globular, or at lea&s;t &s;o near it as not
ea&s;ily to be di&s;cover'd of any other, by the &s;hadow of it in the Eclip&s;es of the
Moon, nor by any other Ob&s;ervations yet made for mea&s;uring the Quantity
or Magnitude of a Degree upon the Surface of it, which is the only certain
and po&s;itive way of performing it: For tho' 'tis certain that the quantity of a
Degree, or a three hunder'd and &s;ixtieth part of the whole compa&s;s of it has been
mea&s;ur'd in &s;everal Latitudes, and &s;ome of them with care enough; yet 'tis
<PB N="482" REF="461">
al&s;o certain, that mo&s;t of them have been made by unaccurate Methods and
uncertain Mea&s;ures; &s;o that they are wholly u&s;ele&s;s in this particular, by
rea&s;on we cannot make a pertinent compari&s;on between them; nor do I
know any other certain and uncontradictable way of proving it, than by either
fir&s;t actually mea&s;uring the quantity of a Degree upon the Earth in Latitudes
very differing, as of one lying very near the Aequinoctial Line, and of an|other,
as near as may be towards either of the Poles; and tho&s;e Men&s;urations
to be made as near as may be by the &s;ame Per&s;ons, with the &s;ame In&s;tru|ments,
and the &s;ame Mea&s;ures, and with the &s;ame Exactne&s;s and Care; by
the comparing together of which two Degrees &s;o mea&s;ur'd, it would plainly
appear whether tho&s;e Degrees would prove equal or unequal; for if they
prov'd to be unequal, then it would plainly appear that the Figure of the
Earth was not of a perfect Globular Form, but &s;ome way or other Oval; if
the Degree near the Aequinoctial be found longer than near the Pole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Away to deter|mine the Earths two Diameters.</NOTE> then
the greate&s;t Diameters of the Earth are in the Plain of the Aequinoctial; if
on the contrary, then the longe&s;t Diameter is in the Axis of its Revolution:
This is &s;uppo&s;ing that the Perpendicular Lines pa&s;s through the Center of the
Earth, whence would follow a &s;econd method of examining the Figure of it,
and that is by examining whether the Horizontal Line be at right Angles
with the Perpendicular; for if the Perpendicular be not found at right An|gles
with the vi&s;ible Horizon, then will the obtu&s;e Angle be on that &s;ide of
the Perpendicular which is next the longe&s;t Diameter of the Earth, and the
Acute towards that which is the &s;horte&s;t; it may therefore be ea&s;ily try'd
upon the &s;ame Place or Promontory where the Horizontal Line of the Sea
can be &s;een both Northwards and Southwards with &s;ome exact In&s;trument
fitted with a long Plumb-line and a large Tele&s;cope &s;et at right Angles with
it, by which the vi&s;ible Horizontal Line may be ob&s;erv'd to what exactne&s;s
it &s;hall be de&s;ir'd, by turning the In&s;trument in the &s;ame place, and viewing
the level of the &s;aid Line through it Northward and Southward. But if up|on
examining the Horizontal Line this way, it &s;hall be found that the Per|pendicular
is at right Angles with the Horizontal, and yet by the other way
of trial, by mea&s;uring a Degree in &s;everal Latitudes, it be found that the
Degrees are differing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether the Perpendiculars re&s;pect the Cen|ter.</NOTE> it will be an Argument that the Perpendiculars do not
always re&s;pect the Center of the Earth, but that they cro&s;s the Axis in &s;ome
other part thereof, which is out of the middle, &s;ometimes towards one Pole,
&s;ometimes towards the other; which may be true, and yet none of the Ob&s;er|vers,
that have hitherto been, may have found, or taken notice thereof; one
Rea&s;on of which may have been, that they have not hitherto &s;u&s;pected it, and
therefore did not inquire after it. But tho' it he probable enough, that the
Body of the Earth is nearly Globular, or rather was &s;o form'd at fir&s;t, that
being the mo&s;t perfect and regular Figure, and that, of which the other Ce|le&s;tial Bodies &s;eem to be of, yet &s;ince we find that there are other varieties in
Nature, as that of the Ring about the Body of <HI>Saturn,</HI> and even here upon
the Earth, that of the differing Variation of the Magnetical Power there|of,
I think it may not be improper to &s;u&s;pect, that there may be &s;uch an un|certainty
of pointing in the Perpendicular or Plumb-line, 'till by certain Ob|&s;ervations
we are a&s;&s;ur'd, and 'tis not &s;afe in Philo&s;ophy to leave inquiry 'till
a certainty be found. It was for &s;ome time believ'd, that the Earth it&s;elf
was a great Load-&s;tone, and that the Poles thereof were the &s;ame with the
Poles of its diurnal Motion; and that the variation of the Needle from that
North Point was occa&s;ion'd only by the approximation to the &s;ides of great
Continents, and according to that Theory, the cau&s;es of the &s;everal varia|tions
of the Needle at &s;everal places were a&s;&s;ign'd to be for this or that Con|tinent,
or this or that Ocean near adjoyning.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Needle re&s;pects not the Poles of diur|nal motion.</NOTE> But upon further Inquiry it
was found that there were &s;everal In&s;tances, that contradicted that Theory,
and that the Needle &s;eem'd to re&s;pect &s;ome Poles that were not in the Poles
of the diurnal Motion, but at &s;ome di&s;tance from them: The&s;e were &s;aid
to be &s;ome va&s;t great Rocks or Mountains of Load-&s;tone at certain di&s;tances
from the Poles of the diurnal motion; which Poles the Needle was &s;uppos'd
always to re&s;pect, and thereupon <HI>William Nautonier</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;tlefrank</HI> in <HI>Langue|dock,</HI>
wrote a large Book, which he Printed in the Year 1603, wherein he
<PB N="483" REF="462">
de&s;cribes his Theory thereof, and furni&s;hes it with In&s;truments and Tables
fitted to find the Longitude thereby.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Variation un|fit for finding the Longitude.</NOTE> Much about the &s;ame time one Mr.
<HI>Anthony Linton,</HI> our own Country-man, a Mini&s;ter I &s;uppo&s;e, Publi&s;h'd
&s;mall Tract in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> under the Title of <HI>News of the Complement of the Art
of Navigation,</HI> in which he pretended to &s;hew a way for di&s;covering the Lon|gitude
by the help of the variation of the Needle, and goes upon the &s;ame
Hypothe&s;is that the Earth was one great round Load-&s;tone, and that the Poles
thereof where at a certain di&s;tance from the Poles of the World, or tho&s;e of
the diurnal Motion; that there were, as it were, proper Magnetical Meri|dians,
and a Magnetical Aequator and Parallels corre&s;ponding, all which
bore the &s;ame re&s;pects to the Magnetical Poles, that the Meridians, Aequa|tor,
and Parallels of the diurnal Motion did to the Poles of the World; and
thence he &s;hews a way how to find the Longitude of any place by Sea or
Land, in the Day or Night. But later Ob&s;ervations have found, that this
Magnetical Variation varies, tho' yet the parts of the Earth do not &s;eem at
a $$to have alter'd their Po&s;ition; this was found by Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> and others in
the Year 1635.</P>
<P>Here $word$ Mr. <HI>Bond</HI> makes a &s;uppo&s;ition, that the&s;e Magnetical Poles
$word$ the Air, not in the Earth, and out of the Poles of the World at a
$word$ di&s;tance from them, and that they were two, one North and an|other
$word$ South; that the Magnetical Axis cro&s;s'd the other Axis in the Center,
$word$ at the Poles made a Revolution about the Poles of the Earth in a cer|t$$n
period of Time, but that at the &s;ame time all over the World the Needles
re&s;pected the&s;e Poles both by variation and dipping; by this he &s;uppos'd the
Longitude might be found in the &s;ame manner as <HI>Linton</HI> and <HI>Nautonnier</HI> had
before &s;uppos'd; but by comparing &s;everal Ob&s;ervations together it is found
that this.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Four Magneti|cal Poles.</NOTE> Theory will not hold neither. And the ingenious Mr. <HI>Halley</HI> has
examin'd and compar'd Ob&s;ervations &s;o far, that he judges it rea&s;onable to
admit four Magnetical Poles in the Earth, two of which are near the South,
and two others near the North Pole, by which he finds the mo&s;t accurate
Ob&s;ervations of variation will be &s;olv'd very rationally.</P>
<P>The&s;e In&s;tances I mention to &s;hew that tho' the Suppo&s;ition of Dr. <HI>Gilbert</HI>
were very ingenious, and &s;eem'd very rational, and in many things agreed
with the Phaenomena of the terrella or round Load-&s;tone; yet was it not a
&s;ufficient Argmment for all others to di&s;i&s;t from inquiring farther, and examin|ing
whether upon trial all the Phaenomena would an&s;wer to the Theory, and
whether it would always remain the &s;ame that he in his time did find it;
for things of this Nature being &s;o far remov'd from common and vulgar Ob|&s;ervation,
and the very Maxims and Grounds of them being taken up upon
I know not who&s;e, Credit, I conceive, it might be worth inquiry by Experi|ment
to examine whether they be really &s;o or not, how generally &s;oever they
be believ'd or con&s;ented to; for 'till that be po&s;itively prov'd by certain Ob|&s;ervations,
there may be good Rea&s;on to he&s;itate upon the Reception of any
Hypothe&s;is how plau&s;ible &s;oever it may appear.</P>
<P>This I mention on the occa&s;ion of con&s;idering the form of the Body of the
Earth, and of the pointing of the Perpendiculars to the very Central and
middle Point thereof; which, tho' it be generally taken for granted, and ve|ry
agreeable to the general Phaenomena, yet I think there are very good Ar|guments
may be produc'd that may make the thing que&s;tionable, &s;ince I do
not find that there has ever yet been made any Ob&s;ervations or Trials ac|curate
enough to determine po&s;itively whether it be certainly &s;o, or other|wi&s;e.
'Tis true, that it is certainly near enough to that Figure of a Globe,
that the common Ob&s;ervations and accounts of Seamen cannot di&s;prove it;
and therefore as to that u&s;e, and &s;o far as the acuratene&s;s of that Art is
hitherto practis'd, it can make no &s;en&s;ible difference; but yet if that Art be
carry'd to a much higher degree of Perfection, as 'tis not impo&s;&s;ible but that
it may, it may be very con&s;iderable in that particular al&s;o: But 'till that be
done we will be contented to agree to the common receiv'd Opinion, and con|&s;ider
of it as of a Globe perfectly round, at lea&s;t as to the Surface of the O|cean,
that part which is of principal con&s;ideration in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Navi|gation.</P>

<P>THe cau&s;es of Gravity and Magnetical Attraction are &s;o far remov'd be|yond
the reach of our Sen&s;es, that the greate&s;t part of Philo&s;ophers
who have indeavour'd to give us an information thereof, have rather made us
more &s;en&s;ible of their and our own Ignorance and Inability to do any thing
therein, &s;ome making it Corporeal, &s;ome Spiritual; but what either of them
mean either by Corpu&s;cles or Magnetical Effluvia, or Atoms, or Magnetick
Vertue, or Hylarchick Spirit, or Anima Mundi, when you come to inquire
to the bottom you find, that neither they nor we know what is meant, and
we do as good as &s;ay 'tis &s;o, becau&s;e it is &s;o; the Rea&s;on of which I conceive
to be, that Men are u&s;ually very impatient of the Labour of examining and
trying, and of going the long and tedious way of coming to a certainty of
knowledge by Experiments, wherein the progre&s;s is very &s;low, and, as it
were, &s;tep by &s;tep; but affect rather to leap into a Theory at once, and make
to them&s;elves an Hypotehe&s;is upon &s;ome few Ob&s;ervations they have met with,
of &s;ome few Experiments they have try'd, or &s;ome pretty Conception or Hypo|the&s;is
they have accidently pitch'd upon that plea&s;es them, to which with a
little Shouldring they can make every ca&s;t to run, as it were, directly, though
at la&s;t it mi&s;s the mark; yet, rather than they will indure the trouble of far|ther
&s;earch by Trials or by Examinations and &s;trict Rea&s;onings, they are
contented to take up with &s;omewhat that may &s;erve to amu&s;e.</P>
<P>It was for &s;ome time believ'd, that the Magnetical Needle did always re|&s;pect
the North and South Poles, not of the Earth, but of the Heavens,
and that the Pole-&s;tar was that wherein the vertue did lie. In proce&s;s of
time it comes to be di&s;cover'd, that this' vertue was not in the Heavens, but
in the Earth, and that the Magnetical Needle, had, in &s;ome parts of the
World, a con&s;iderable variation from the Meridian of the place, the North
end declining in this part towards the Ea&s;t, in that towards the We&s;t, in
&s;ome places more, in others le&s;s; but that this variation was fix'd and per|petual
to the place, and that by rea&s;on, &s;aid &s;ome, for that there were to be
found in the North certain Rocks of Mountains of Load-&s;tones, which at|tracted
the North end of the Needle to them from all parts of the World.
But this, in a &s;hort time, al&s;o vani&s;h'd as appearing ridiculous, and not an&s;wer|ing
to the Con&s;equences that mu&s;t have follow'd from it. In&s;tead of which
another cau&s;e is introduc'd for the variation, and that is the great Conti|nents
that lie either on this or that Hand, and the great Sea that lies on the
other: Hence it was &s;uppos'd that Variation would be found always re|gular,
and the &s;ame in the &s;ame place at all times, as proceeding from the
greater attraction from the parts of the Earth; which were more prominent
and elevated, and which were not likely to be alter'd by time; at lea&s;t, not
enough to make a &s;en&s;ible variation of the variation. This was Dr. <HI>Gilberts,</HI>
but in proce&s;s of Time was, by Mr. <HI>Gillibrand</HI> of this Colledge, and &s;ome
others, found to alter, and there was found a variation of the variation of
the Magnetick Needle in the &s;ame place, and that not verify'd in one, but
in thou&s;ands of places. This overthrew all the former Hypothe&s;es, and we
are now to &s;eek a new one; Mr. <HI>Bond,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Philips,</HI> and &s;ome others,
have been hammering at a new Hypothe&s;is, wherein they make the Magne|tick
vertue to be in the Air, and &s;o the Magnetick Poles to be moveable
in Circles round about the Poles of the Aequinoctial, and the Mag|netick
<PB N="485" REF="464">
Axis of the Earth to have a Conical motion about the Axis of the di|urnal
Revolution: Which Conical motion they &s;uppo&s;e to be perform'd in
a certain number of Years; &s;o that at length the Polar Points of the Mag|netick
vertue after they have revolv'd a periodick Circle, return from the
&s;ame Point from which they did begin. Others have taken other Hypothe|&s;es,
and rais'd other Conclu&s;ions and Con&s;equences from them; but &s;till af|ter
all we are yet to &s;eek whether this motion of the Magnetick Polar Points
be in &s;traight Line, or in a Curve as in a Circle, Ellip&s;e, or &s;ome other more
irregular Figure; whether it move round the diurnal Pole or &s;ome other
Point; whether it move Ea&s;tward or We&s;tward; whether it move nearer or
farther off from the Pole; whether it move quicker at one time than another;
whether it will return or continually proceed, whether there are only two
or more Magnetical Poles; whether the Magnetical Axis of one, or Axes, if
there are more than one, pa&s;s through the Center of the Globe, or be&s;ides
it, and if more, whether parallel to each other, or Oblique, and whether one
only hath a motion or whether both; whether the&s;e motions keep the &s;ame Ve|locities
or differing; and many other the like Queries might be made; I could
add a hundred, of which we are &s;till to &s;eek, and cannot give a po&s;itive an|&s;wer,
becau&s;e there are not yet materials enough of Ob&s;ervations to build a
certain Theory upon; and the Ob&s;ervations that have been hitherto made
have been &s;o gro&s;s and imperfect, that little of certainty can be concluded
from them, and therefore &s;uch Ob&s;ervations can only be rectify'd by Time,
by rea&s;on that the Degrees and Steps of this progre&s;&s;ive motion are &s;o far
undefin'd, that &s;ome Years mu&s;t be &s;tay'd before the alterations that are
made in the interim in the motion can be made &s;en&s;ible, and when &s;en&s;ible,
they are very imperfectly defin'd. Hence, I &s;uppo&s;e, it may have proceeded,
that we have lately heard of &s;ome &s;uch Magnetical Ob&s;ervations as have
&s;eem'd to prove a &s;tation of that motion, and &s;ome others of a differing Na|ture,
which, in probability, have proceeded from &s;ome imperfection in the
Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>For if we con&s;ider the Nature of &s;uch Ob&s;ervations, how many Requi&s;ites
there are nece&s;&s;ary to make any one as it ought to be, we &s;hall quickly find
that our &s;tore to fit materials to work upon will be exceedingly &s;mall; and
that upon examining into or querying upon &s;uch Ob&s;ervations as we meet
with, we &s;hall be apt to throw by and neglect as u&s;ele&s;s the greate&s;t part&punc;
for there are but a very few in the World that are fit and able to make &s;uch
Ob&s;ervations, or that know what is Pertinent and what Impertinent: Fewer
there are that will be at the trouble of doing what they know fit, and tho'
Skill, and Will be joyn'd, yet if In&s;truments and other a&s;&s;i&s;tances are wanting,
they will come &s;hort of Perfection.</P>
<P>As tho' an Ob&s;erver knows how to find the true meridian of the place,
how to place his Needle, what inconveniences to look after for preventing
(as the removing of all &s;uch Magnetical or Chalibeate Bodies as influence
the Needle) how to ob&s;erve the Angle the Needle makes with the Meridian
Line, and the like; yet if he wants fitting In&s;truments, whether Mathema|tical
or Magnetical, to do the&s;e Requi&s;ites and convenient A&s;&s;i&s;tances, and
a &s;ufficient &s;tock of Per&s;everance and Indu&s;try to pro&s;ecute the trials to the
utmo&s;t exactne&s;s, the effect will be imperfect, whatever is look'd after beyond
that exactne&s;s: For in&s;tance, after all other Requi&s;ites are found, if there be
wanting &s;uch a Needle as will certainly di&s;tingui&s;h to the &s;ixth part of a De|gree,
then any &s;uch Ob&s;ervations are wholly u&s;ele&s;s in &s;uch Inquiries where
a much greater accuratene&s;s is requir'd; and for the making them &s;ignificant,
there is no other way but &s;taying a &s;ufficient number of Years, and the
cour&s;er the Ob&s;ervations be, the greater number of Years are requi&s;ite to
make them equally u&s;eful; and even then they are altogether u&s;ele&s;s for
an&s;wering many other Queries; as if it &s;hould be queried, whether the pro|gre&s;s
for that whole interval have been equal or unequal, and if unequal,
what tho&s;e Degrees have been and at what times, whether in differing Years,
or differing parts of the &s;ame Year? <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

Now &s;ince Time is that which cannot be alter'd, and that therefore Po|&s;terity
only are like to have the Fruit of our Labours and Indeavours of that
kind, I thought it would be be&s;t to make &s;uch In&s;truments as would make
that &s;en&s;ible in a very &s;hort time, which, by the common, could not be but
in a long, by tho&s;e means if po&s;&s;ible to reduce our Ob&s;ervations to u&s;e with|in
the compa&s;s of our own Lives; for if a Needle could be made that &s;hould
di&s;tingui&s;h the alterations or the variation of the Variation, as nicely to the
parts of a Minute as the pre&s;ent Needles do to the parts of a Degree, then
&s;hould we di&s;cern as &s;en&s;ible an operation or alteration in one Year, as by the
other in three&s;core, and in ten Years as in &s;ix hundred; for that all other re|qui&s;ite
accuratene&s;s can be procur'd, as to di&s;tingui&s;h the Meridian Line,
the divi&s;ion of the Angles, the interposed &s;pace of time, the removal of im|peding
or altering materials that may influence the Needles.</P>
<P>Divers have attempted to procure Instruments fit for this purpo&s;e, &s;ome
by Needles of great length, others by &s;horter view'd with Gla&s;&s;es or Micro|&s;copes,
others by other ways, as by one of the late Leip&s;ick Acta may be
&s;een; every of which I conceive to be &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e, and do
only aim to di&s;cover the divi&s;ions of the &s;ame Angle; that which I am now
de&s;cribing does that indeed of Con&s;equence, but directly and immedi|ately
it magnifies or multiplies the Angle, by making that a Degree which is
really but a Minute, and &s;o by con&s;equence contracting of time.</P>
<P>'Tis then, in &s;hort, is no other but this,</P>
<P>A Needle is fix'd at right Angles upon a very light and &s;traight Axis of
Wood or Bra&s;s, which Axis hath at each end the point of a very fine and
&s;harp Needle, the finer and &s;harper the better, which is ea&s;ily enough pro|curable:
the&s;e Needles points are to be put into two &s;mall Center holes,
made fit for them in a Ring, or Frame made after the &s;hape in the draught.</P>

<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 20. 1684. In my la&s;t Lecture I explain'd to you the&s;e two la&s;t Lines
or Circles which are u&s;ually drawn upon the Superficies of a Globe made to
repre&s;ent the Body of the Earth, which were, Fir&s;t, All great Circle pa&s;&s;ing
through the two Polar Points of the Earth, or tho&s;e Points upon which the
Body of it, or the <HI>Primum Mobile</HI> is continually mov'd round once in twenty
four Hours, or the time of a natural Day, which are call'd Meridians.
And, Secondly, All tho&s;e Circular Lines, which may be &s;uppos'd to be de|&s;crib'd
by all the Points of any one &s;uch Meridian, turn'd round
upon the &s;aid Globe, &s;uppos'd to &s;tand &s;till; or by the conver&s;ion of the
Globe upon its Poles, the Meridian being &s;uppos'd to &s;tand &s;till, the effect
being the &s;ame in both ca&s;es, as to this particular. The&s;e Lines or Circles
are call'd Parallels, either becau&s;e they are all parallel to one another, or ra|ther
becau&s;e all the le&s;&s;er of them are parallel to the middlemo&s;t and great
Circle, which is call'd the Aequinoctial, Aequator, or mo&s;t commonly be Sea|men,
the Line.</P>
<P>The&s;e two &s;orts of Circles are the principal made u&s;e of in the De&s;cripti|on
of the Superficial Parts of the Earth, and to which all other Lines made
u&s;e of either in Geography, A&s;tronomy, or Navigation are reduced, the&s;e a|lone
&s;erving to &s;hew the Po&s;ition and Situation of the &s;everal parts of the
Earth to one another, and to determine the po&s;itive Point or Spot upon the
Artificial Globe, every real place upon the Surface of the Earth ought to
have, and <HI>Vice Ver&s;a</HI> any place &s;ituated on the Globe may be found upon the
Earth: And being once &s;o determin'd, 'tis &s;uppos'd by mo&s;t, that it is al|ways
the &s;ame, that is, the &s;ame place upon the Superficies of the Earth be|ing
once adju&s;ted both as to its Longitude and Latitude, &s;hall always remain
and continue the &s;ame both in re&s;pect of the one and the other Po&s;ition. As
&s;uppo&s;e this City of <HI>London,</HI> if the Latitude and Longitude be once certain|ly
ob&s;erv'd and determin'd, and &s;o po&s;ited on the Globe, it is &s;uppos'd that
it &s;hall always remain and continue to have the &s;ame in all &s;ucceeding Ages,
<PB N="487" REF="466">
without any Variation or Deviation from the &s;ame, whatever Deviation or
Variation doth happen in the Caele&s;tial Bodies without it. This, I &s;ay, is
&s;uppos'd or believ'd by the mo&s;t Geographers and A&s;tronomers: But yet
not by all; for there have been, and there now are &s;ome, as particularly
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pierre Pettit,</HI> who have not only &s;uppos'd, but po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted,
that the&s;e al&s;o have a Variation, and that after a certain time both the Latitude
and Longitude of many places, upon the Surface of the Earth, hath a &s;en|&s;iable
change and difference; and to confirm this he hath compar'd many Ob|&s;ervations
Recorded by the Antients, of the Latitude of divers places, as
particularly tho&s;e of <HI>Paris, Rome,</HI> and &s;ome other eminent places with later
and modern Ob&s;ervations of the Latitudes of the &s;ame places;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Latitude and Longitude of places va|ries.</NOTE> whereby 'tis
found, that there are very con&s;iderable differences between them, which he
a&s;cribes to the variation of the Poles of the Earth. Certain it is, that la|ter
Ob&s;ervations concerning the Latitudes of &s;everal very eminent places of
the World do very much differ from tho&s;e that were a&s;&s;ign'd them by the An|tients;
as particularly that of the famous Accademy of <HI>Greece Athens,</HI> who&s;e
pre&s;ent Latitude is found to differ almo&s;t two whole Degrees from what
was formerly a&s;&s;ign'd to it, as I have been inform'd by the Ingenious and
Learn'd Traveller Mr. <HI>Francis Vernon,</HI> who with great care made the Ob|&s;ervation.
I could in&s;tance al&s;o in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and &s;everal other eminent
places not mention'd by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pettit,</HI> but I &s;hall omit them at pre&s;ent
'till &s;ome farther and more accurate trials be made for this purpo&s;e, and up|on
this occa&s;ion mention only, that, I conceive, it would not be ami&s;s that
there &s;hould be &s;ome Ob&s;ervations purpo&s;ely made to examine this Theory,
and reduce it to a certainty, for 'till that be done it is but Hypothetical to
&s;uppo&s;e the Polar Points of the Earth fix'd or moveable, there being as great
a po&s;&s;ibility of their moveablene&s;s, as there was of the Magnetical Poles,
before the di&s;covery thereof made by &s;ome of this College in the Year 1635.
That, I &s;uppo&s;e, which prompt'd Mon&s;ieur <HI>Pettit</HI> to make this a&s;&s;ertion, or
at lea&s;t gave him a hint for this Inquiry, was a kind of mi&s;take of <HI>Jo&s;eph
Scaliger</HI> in an Epi&s;tle of his wrote to <HI>David Rivatlus</HI> upon the occa&s;ion of
the Explanation of the variation of the Magnetical Needle from the true
Meridian, made by Dr. <HI>Gilbert</HI> in his Book <HI>de Magnete,</HI> Publi&s;h'd not long
before. This Epi&s;tle was Printed with other Works of his at <HI>Paris</HI> in the
Year 1610. but written in the Year 1604 for by his Di&s;cour&s;e he would
&s;eem to explain the Rea&s;on of the Magnetical Variation or the Meridians
them&s;elves, which he pretends mu&s;t needs follow from the Theory of the
praece&s;&s;ion of the Aequinoctial Points, and yet at the &s;ame time he &s;ays, that
the <HI>Cyno&s;ure</HI> or Tail of the le&s;&s;er Bear was never farther from the North
Pole of the World than now it is. But in &s;hort (to &s;pend no more time up|on
declaring and explaining this Opinion) I &s;ay, 'tis very evident he under|&s;tood
not what he &s;aid him&s;elf, or if he did, 'tis certain he gro&s;ly mi&s;took
the Explanation of the matter, and has been long &s;ince confuted by <HI>Maginus,</HI>
who was then profe&s;&s;or of A&s;tronomy at <HI>Padua.</HI></P>
<P>Now it there be any ground for this Opinion, then mu&s;t al&s;o follow an
alteration of all the Meridians and Parallels imagin'd to be made upon this
Globe of the Earth; for if the Polar Points, or the Axis of the diurnal
motion of the Earth does vary, tho&s;e mu&s;t al&s;o vary with it, and con&s;e|quently
the Po&s;itions and Di&s;tances of all places, in re&s;pect of them, mu&s;t
vary al&s;o; and con&s;equently, as <HI>Scaliger</HI> &s;ays, the Po&s;itions or Meridians of
Dials, will, after a certain time, be fal&s;e, as will al&s;o the very Dial it&s;elf,
as if it had been remov'd and plac'd in a wrong Latitude and wrong Po&s;i|tion.
However, the Po&s;ition and di&s;tances of places one to another will
contain the &s;ame, tho' they differ in re&s;pect of the Heavens; and therefore
if tho&s;e be procur'd, tho' both the Latitude and Longitude of all &s;hould be
alter'd, this De&s;cription or Picture of the Earth, upon the Artificial Globe,
would remain true and unalter'd, and other Meridians and Parallels might
be drawn over them.</P>
<P>But to leave this Digre&s;&s;ion for the pre&s;ent, I &s;hall proceed to con&s;ider of
the Divi&s;ions u&s;ually made upon the&s;e Circles de&s;crib'd upon the Artificial
Globe.</P>
<P><PB N="488" REF="467">
All the&s;e Circles then both great and le&s;&s;er are divided,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The divisions u&s;ually made on the Globe.</NOTE> or &s;uppos'd to be
divided into three hundred and &s;ixty equal parts, which are call'd Degrees,
Grades, Steps, but none of them are number'd quite round, &s;ave only the
Aequinoctial, which noteth the divi&s;ions of Longitude, but all the re&s;t are
fir&s;t divided into four equal parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the rea&s;on why the Circles are divid|ed in 360.</NOTE> which are call'd Quadrants, and each
Quadrant into ninety; what the rea&s;on was at fir&s;t of pitching upon this
number of three hundred and &s;ixty, I know not, there being no Rea&s;on in
Nature for this more than for &s;ome other Divi&s;ions, tho' the A&s;trologers
make much thereof, and build much thereupon; but the mo&s;t likely &s;eems
to have been this, that the Radius being equal to the Subten&s;e of a &s;ixth
part of the Circle, did very naturally prompt them to that Primary and na|tural
Divi&s;ion of it into &s;ix equal Parts or Sextants; which divi&s;ion al&s;o did
both bi&s;ect and tri&s;ect the whole Circle, and gave them the Halfs and
Trines, or Thirds; then bi&s;ection being the ea&s;ie&s;t of all other Sections, the
bi&s;ecting the Bi&s;ection gave them the Quadri&s;ection, Quadrants, or Quar|tiles
of the whole; from the&s;e Quadrants &s;etting off the Sextants either
way, gave them the Duodecimals or Twelfs of the Circle, or the Thirds of
the Quadrants or Quartiles. The&s;e Duodecimals in the Ecliptick, of which
I &s;hall hereafter &s;peak, are call'd Signs, which &s;ignifies Marks, Divi&s;ions, or
Sections of the Ecliptick. Thus far the cau&s;e or their Divi&s;ions, seem'd
rea&s;onable enough, more e&s;pecially for the New Moons being twelve in the
Year; as did al&s;o their next of &s;ubdividing each of the&s;e into halves,
making four and twenties or Hours, into which number they divided the
Natural Day, or one whole Revolution of the Earth. But the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> and
<HI>Tartars</HI> contented them&s;elves with the Duodecimal, dividing the whole Re|volution
only into twelve Cha. which we mu&s;t call Bi-hours; tho' on the
contrary, they divided their Zodiack into twenty four parts, which we mu&s;t
call half Signs, being produc'd only by Bi&s;ection upon the fir&s;t Sextants; but
why the Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern <HI>Literati</HI> differ'd afterwards, is not ea&s;y to gue&s;s.</P>
<P>And whether the We&s;tern <HI>Literati</HI> did divide the&s;e twenty fourths into
fifteenths,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difference be|tween the Eastern and We&s;tern Lite|rati.</NOTE> that they might introduce into the Circle both Tri&s;ection and
Qui&s;ection, which are both nece&s;&s;ary to this &s;ubdivi&s;ion, I dare not deter|mine.
That which &s;eems to have been the mo&s;t likely occa&s;ion, I conceive
to have been the nearne&s;s of this number of three hundred and &s;ixty to the
natural Divi&s;ion of the Zodiack, by the annual motion of the Sun, which e|very
Day doth almo&s;t mea&s;ure &s;uch a &s;pace, compleating its Circuit in three
hundred &s;ixty five Days and a quarter almo&s;t, as the Revolutions of the
Moon in a Year might prompt them to make u&s;e or the Duodecimal Section
for the Zodiack. But whatever were the Occa&s;ions or Rea&s;ons that prompt'd
them to the&s;e Divi&s;ions, certain it is that now all do agree to make u&s;e
thereof, and call this twelfth part a Sign, and the three hundred and &s;ixtieth
part a Degree; and thence each Sign containeth thirty Degrees, each of
the&s;e Degrees they again &s;ubdivide into &s;ixty equal parts, which little parts
they call Minutes or Primes, each of the&s;e Primes &s;ubdivided by &s;ixty, give
Seconds or Second Minutes; a &s;ixtieth part of a Second is a Third, a &s;ixtieth
of a Third a Fourth, and &s;o onward by Sexage&s;imal Subdivi&s;ion, to Fifths,
Sixths, Sevenths, in a continued Geometrical Progre&s;&s;ion, as far as is needful;
for what Rea&s;on they have pitch'd upon this Sexage&s;imal Progre&s;&s;ion, I can|not
imagine, unle&s;s it were becau&s;e they had divided the Sextant (which, as
I told you, was the fir&s;t and mo&s;t natural Divi&s;ion of the Circle, its Subten&s;e
being equal to the Radius) into &s;ixty Degrees; but certain it is, that it
is much more incommodious for Calculation than the common Decimal way,
and much more than a Duodecimal, which might be invented; for that the
Sexage&s;imal mu&s;t take two places for every A&s;cent, whereas the Decimal
takes up one place only for one Step or A&s;cent. So al&s;o might a Duodeci|mal,
if rightly order'd, by making two new &s;ingle Characters for ten and
eleven, and making the Character of ten &s;erve for twelve or Dozen; then
the next or third place will be Gro&s;&s;es, the fourth Dugro&s;&s;es, the fifth Gro&s;s
Gro&s;&s;es, the &s;ixth Du gro&s;s Gro&s;&s;es, and &s;o onward, an&s;werable to Unites,
Tens, Hundreds, Thou&s;ands, Ten Thou&s;ands, Hundred Thou&s;ands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
in the Decimal progre&s;&s;ion of places. And tho' po&s;&s;ibly the Names and
<PB N="489" REF="468">
Practi&s;e of it may &s;eem at fir&s;t a little uncouth and &s;trange, yet a little u&s;e
will ea&s;ily overcome that difficulty, and make it manife&s;t to be a much better
Progre&s;&s;ion than the Decimal, which is now generally u&s;ed: But this only by
the bye.</P>
<P>I &s;hall next proceed to &s;hew how the&s;e Divi&s;ions are made u&s;e of in tho&s;e
two &s;orts of Circles. Fir&s;t, Then, the Aequinoctial, and all the le&s;&s;er Circles,
begin their Divi&s;ions from the Section of them by that half of the Meridian
which is call'd the fir&s;t Meridian, which pa&s;&s;es through the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean,
of which I have already &s;poken; and the Divi&s;ions of them are accounted from
thence Ea&s;twardly, 'till the whole Revolution be compleated and end in this
fir&s;t Meridian in three hundred and &s;ixty. But the Divi&s;ions made upon the
Meridians begin to be number'd or accounted from the Aequinoctial, and end
at each Pole in ninety, which expre&s;&s;es the &s;everal Latitudes of tho&s;e places
that lie under them, or their breadth or di&s;tance from the Aequinoctial Line,
either towards the North or South Pole.</P>
<P>Now, the next thing is to con&s;ider, how both the&s;e Lines and the divi&s;ions
of them, proper and peculiar to any one place, may be actually found at that
place, which is the ultimate end and re&s;ult of all that is &s;ought for in the Art
of Navigation; for the&s;e being truly found for any place, they pre&s;ently
&s;hew Its true Po&s;ition and Situation in the re&s;pect of all other known and de|termin'd
places upon the Earth.</P>
<P>In order to perform which Inquiry the whole Art of Navigation is con|triv'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The end of the Art of Navi|gation.</NOTE>
and all the a&s;&s;i&s;tances that can be procur'd, either from Nature
or Art, are fetch'd in and made u&s;e of; and all indeed that can be found,
tho' very many and very curious and ingenious, are little enough, and too
few to accompli&s;h the &s;ame to that certainty and accuratene&s;s that is to be
de&s;ir'd, and is nece&s;&s;ary to compleat and perfect the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The Helps then that are made u&s;e of are either afforded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Helps.</NOTE> Fir&s;t, By the
Heavens and the Caele&s;tial Bodies, &s;uch as the Sun, Moon, Planets and

<P>Or, Secondly, By the Terre&s;trial, or &s;uch things upon and In the Body of
the Earth it&s;elf, as afford Indications and Character&s;ticks proper and &s;ufficient
to direct the Geographer and Hydrographer, for di&s;covering and determin|ing,
by known mea&s;ures, how every place is Po&s;ited and Situated in re&s;pect of
tho&s;e Lines I have already mentioned; and thence of determining their Po&s;i|tion
and Magnitude in re&s;pect to one another in regard of other imaginary
Lines, which are taken in from Art to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Mariner in his Computations
and Accounts; &s;uch as are the Rhomb Lines and other great Circles which are
neither Meridians nor Aequator, but &s;uch as are nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;uppos'd ei|ther
for computing the way of the Ship, or Cour&s;e &s;teer'd, or for computing
and re&s;olving Triangles, or for giving the Po&s;ition and neare&s;t di&s;tance be|tween
place and place, in a great Circle or determin'd Azymuth.</P>
<P>Three things then may be found out by the help of the Caele&s;tial Bodies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three things to be found by the help of Caele&s;ti|al Bodies.</NOTE></P>

<PB N="490" REF="469">
the contrary, &s;ome of which may be done by Land Ob&s;ervations, but not
by &s;uch as can be made at Sea.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1">The Fir&s;t Maxim then (of which we are &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ur'd for this pur|po&s;e)
is this, That the di&s;tance of the fixt Stars is &s;o very great and im|men&s;e
in re&s;pect of the Magnitude of the Earth, that its whole Body is
but as it were an in&s;en&s;ible Point; &s;o that the Figure, Appearance, Po&s;i|tion
and Di&s;tance of all the fixt Stars, to, or from, one another, doth to the
naked Eye, or a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the be&s;t common In&s;trument, appear exactly the
&s;ame, whether the Eye be plac'd in the very Center of the Earth, or in any
Point of the Superficies, or any other Point of the whole Body. So that
not only the Center of the Earth may be taken to be the Center of the
imaginary Concave Sphaere wherein all the fixt Stars are plac'd, but any o|ther
Point what&s;oever of its whole Exten&s;ion or Corporeity.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2">A Second Maxim of the <HI>Ari&s;tarcheans</HI> or <HI>Copernicans</HI> is this, That the di|&s;tance
of the fixt Stars is &s;o incomprehen&s;ibly great, that tho' the Earth be &s;up|pos'd
to move round the Sun in a Circular or Elliptical Line, who&s;e Diame|ter
is ten thou&s;and times the Diameter of the Earth, yet that even this whole
Circle, in compari&s;on of the imaginary Orb of the fixt Stars, is but a Point,
and that therefore with the naked Eye and common In&s;truments no differ|ence
can be di&s;cover'd of the Di&s;tances and Po&s;itions of the fixt Stars in re|&s;pect
of one another, tho', as I have el&s;ewhere &s;hewn, there is a way to find a
difference by the help of very long and good Tele&s;copes, fixt at Land, but
no In&s;truments at Sea can di&s;cover it; which is enough for our pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3">A Third Maxim is, That two Points of the Earth do &s;teadily point or
direct towards two Points among the fixt Stars in the Heavens, which Points
are call'd the two Polar Points, the two in the Heavens being Perpendicular
over the two on the Earth; and the Diameter of the Earth pa&s;&s;ing through
the&s;e Points, is call'd the Axis of the World, and &s;uppos'd to be continu'd
to the fixt Stars: And tho' this Axis be carry'd round in the Orb of the
Earth in a Paralleli&s;m, and &s;o de&s;cribes an Elliptical Cylinder, who&s;e long|e&s;t
Diameter is the Diameter of the Earth's Orb about the Sun, yet &s;o va&s;t|ly
are the fixt Stars di&s;tant, that this whole Ellip&s;is, among the fixt Stars,
appears but a Point, and the Axis of the Earth &s;eems to re&s;pect one and the
&s;ame Point among the fixt Stars quite round the Year.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="4">A Fourth Maxim is, That all Perpendicular Lines re&s;pect the Center of
the Earth, and that the level of Water, and other Liquors is a plain and
at right Angles with this Perpendicular in every Point of the Surface of the
Earth.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="5">Fifthly, That every one of the&s;e Perpendiculars, &s;uppos'd continu'd to
the fixt Stars, will, by the diurnal Rotation of the Earth, de&s;cribe, among
the fixt Stars, a Circular Line; which Circular Line, an&s;wering to the Per|pendicular
or Zenith of any place, will appear the &s;ame round the Year, to
any In&s;trument that can be us'd at Sea.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="6">Sixthly, That the level of the Water, or any other Liquor &s;uppos'd con|tinu'd
to the fixt Stars, will actually divide the whole Sphaere thereof into
two equal parts, tho' it be out of the Center of the Earth, and upon its
Surface; and tho' the Body of the Earth it&s;elf be &s;uppos'd to be as far di|&s;tant
from the Center of that Orb, as it is di&s;tant from the Center of the
Sun.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="7">Seventhly, That the vi&s;ible Angle of any Caele&s;tial Body, with this Per|pendicular
or Zenith Line of any place, or with the plain of the level of
the Water or Horizon, will be the &s;ame (as to any thing that can be di&s;co|ver'd
by In&s;truments at Sea) as if the Center of the In&s;trument were in the
<PB N="491" REF="470">
Center of the Earth, and that Center of the Earth were always in the
Center of the Sun, and that Center of the Sun were the true Center of the
Orb of the fixt Stars; and thence</P>
<P>Eighthly, We are to conclude that all Ob&s;ervations of the fixt Stars,<MILESTONE N="8">
where&s;oever made upon the Surface of the Earth and Sea, will give the &s;ame
appearances, as if the Eye or Center of the In&s;trument (by which &s;uch an
Angle is mea&s;ur'd) were at all times in the Center of the Orb of the fixt
Stars.</P>
<P>Ninethly, That all Ob&s;ervations to be made of the Po&s;itions of the Sun in<MILESTONE N="9">
re&s;pect of the fixt Stars, will be the &s;ame, as if the Eye and Center of the
In&s;trument were plac'd in the Center of the Earth; and that whether the
Sun be &s;uppos'd to be mov'd about the Earth, or the Earth about the Sun,
the vi&s;ible appearances of the Place, Line, or Point of the Sun among the
fixt Stars, will be in both ca&s;es the &s;ame.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not now meddle with the appearances of the other Planetary Bo|dies,
becau&s;e at pre&s;ent, for this purpo&s;e, I &s;hall not have occa&s;ion to make
u&s;e of them, but re&s;erve the con&s;ideration of their appearances to another
part of this Di&s;cour&s;e, wherein I &s;hall more particularly treat concerning
the ways for finding the Longitude of places by Caele&s;tial Helps.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, for finding the true Meridian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ways for find|ing the Meri|dian.</NOTE> or North and South Line of
any place, there are very many and very differing ways that have been in|vented
and Publi&s;h'd by &s;everal Authors for this purpo&s;e, of which &s;ome are
much more difficult and complicated, and prae-&s;uppo&s;e &s;everal things to be
known which require another method than this I am now di&s;cour&s;ing of;
which may be very u&s;eful for performing other kinds of Problems, but are
not &s;o proper for what I here intend: Others that are more &s;imple and plain,
and yet &s;ufficient to perform this effect; &s;ome of the&s;e are more proper to be
made u&s;e of at Land, others are more ea&s;y and practicable, and can be made
u&s;e of at Sea as well as on the Land.</P>
<P>The&s;e ways are either, Fir&s;t, By help of the Sun in the Day-time, or by
the help of the fixt Stars in the Night.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By the sun two ways.</NOTE> by the help of the Sun, are twofold; Fir&s;t, By the help of an Azy|muth
Compa&s;s to ob&s;erve the true Azymuth or Amplitude of the Body of
the Sun in its Ri&s;ing in the Morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t. Way.</NOTE> and Setting at Night of the &s;ame Day
in the Winter half Year, or the &s;aid Amplitude of the Sun in Setting at
Night, and ri&s;ing the next Morning in the Summer half Year; for by divid|ing
the Angle, made by tho&s;e two Azymuths, into two equal parts, the Me|ridian
Line for the place where it is inquir'd and ob&s;erv'd is given, the Me|ridian
Line this way found, is that which is mo&s;t commonly us'd, and will be
near enough the truth for any common u&s;e, as for finding the variation of the
Compa&s;s for the place where it is made, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But yet, it is not exactly true,
nor can it in &s;ome more curious Inquiries, be made u&s;e of, and that, Fir&s;t,
By rea&s;on that all the times of the Year, unle&s;s it be on the very &s;olftitial
or longe&s;t and &s;horte&s;t Days, and even then al&s;o unle&s;s the Sol&s;tice be ex|actly
at Noon, the Sun is either increa&s;ing or decrea&s;ing its Declination; and
&s;o the Sun is really in a differing parallel in the Morning from what it was at
Night of the &s;ame Night, and in an other parallel at Night than what it was
in the Morning of the &s;ame Day, and con&s;equently the Ri&s;ing and Setting
Azymuths or Amplitudes do not make equal Angles with the true Meridian
Line; but the nearer the Sun is to either of the Sol&s;titical Points, the le&s;s
the Error, and the nearer the Aequinoctial, the greater.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Meridian this way found is not exact, by rea&s;on of the
differing Refraction of the Air in the Morning from what it is in the Even|ing,
which I my &s;elf have very often ob&s;erv'd here at <HI>London,</HI> and may be
much more con&s;iderable in more Southern Countries, where the difference
between the warmth of the Air at Sun Ri&s;ing and Sun Setting is much more
con&s;iderable than in this more temperate Climate, tho' on the other &s;ide that
<PB N="492" REF="471">
greater difference of Refraction may, I confe&s;s, make a much le&s;s difference
of Azymuth or Amplitude where, the Sun's Ri&s;ing and Setting is nearer to a
Perpendicularity to the Horizon. However, &s;ome uncertainty is thereby
caus'd, and in no ca&s;e, but what I before mention'd, is exact: However,
this is better than the way that is mo&s;t made u&s;e of at Sea, for finding the va|riation
of the Magnetical Needle or Compa&s;s, tho' yet it be far enough
from the accuratene&s;s de&s;irable: for the way by them generally practis'd is
not by comparing the Morning and Evening Amplitude together, but either
the Morning or the Evening alone e&s;teeming the apparent Amplitude to be that
which by In&s;truments or Calculation for that Day and Latitude they are in,
the true Amplitude ought to be, allowing nothing at all for Refraction; in
which ca&s;e the vi&s;ible Amplitude, by Refraction, makes more difference from
what it truly ought to be, than two Amplitudes compar'd together, tho' &s;uf|fering
differing Refractions, will produce.</P>
<P>A Second way of finding the Meridian of any place by the Sun, is this,
Fir&s;t, By the help of an Azymuth Compa&s;s to ob&s;erve the Azymuth of the
Sun about three Hours before Noon, at the &s;ame moment another Per&s;on
with &s;ome convenient In&s;trument ob&s;erving the true Altitude of it above the
Horizon, then &s;taying 'till about three Hours after Noon, and watching di|ligently
when the Sun is de&s;cended to the &s;ame Altitude or height it was ob|&s;erv'd
at in the Morning, and noting the true Azymuth thereof, and pro|ceeding
to divide the Angle between the two Azymuths, this way found by
the Azymuth Compa&s;s, into two equal parts; this doth give the Meridian
Line, and at the &s;ame time the variation of the Compa&s;s. This is abundant|ly
more exact than the former way; for, Fir&s;t, The Sun is to be taken when
at a con&s;iderable height above the Horizon, and &s;o by that means is free for
the mo&s;t part from Refraction, whereas the Refraction in the Horizon is &s;ome|times
exceeding great. Secondly, The times between the two Ob&s;ervations
being but &s;hort, as four, five or &s;ix Hours at mo&s;t; the difference that is
caus'd by the Sun's altering its Declination, is not &s;o &s;en&s;ible; as in a longer
time; and therefore this of the two is much to be prefer'd, and is &s;ometimes
made u&s;e of at Sea al&s;o.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e Azymuths may be ea&s;ily enough ob&s;erv'd upon the Land, where a
Horizontal Floor may be procur'd convenient for this purpo&s;e? but at Sea,
where the Ship is roul'd and turn'd by the un&s;teady Surface of the Waves, it
&s;eems more difficult. But even there al&s;o Art has not left the Mariner with|out
a convenience of a Horizontal Plain, which may be call'd fix'd, and that
is the Compa&s;s Needle or Chard conveniently &s;u&s;pended in a Box; for by its
&s;u&s;pen&s;ion it maintains its Level, and by the Magnetical Vertue of the mid|dle
it keeps its Po&s;ition in re&s;pect of the Points of the Horizon, notwith|standing
all the un&s;teadine&s;s of the Ve&s;&s;el in which it is carry'd: But of this
and other In&s;truments, I &s;hall hereafter di&s;cour&s;e more at large.</P>
<P>There is another Way of finding the Azymuth by the Sun or Stars at all
times, either of the Day or Night, and that is by the help of exact Clocks,
either with a Pendulum, or &s;ome other exact way of equally and exactly
mea&s;uring and dividing of Time; and this method will be the mo&s;t ea&s;y, the
mo&s;t exact, and mo&s;t practicable at Sea, &s;uch a Clock at all times giving the
true time of the Day or Night, if it be &s;et with care at the Ri&s;ing and Set|ting
of the Sun, and then either by &s;ome one of the Projections (for it may
be done by all the three u&s;ual Projections with ca&s;e) or by the Doctrine of
Triangles: the Azymuth of the Sun or Star, for that time, is given, the Lati|tude
being &s;uppos'd known; but the Meridian is given, tho' the Latitude be
not &s;uppos'd known, and without either Projection or Trigonometrical Cal|culation,
if the times of Ri&s;ing and Setting be noted; for if by the &s;aid
Clock the exact time when the Sun is ri&s;en ju&s;t above the Horizon in the
Morning, &s;o that the under Limb of it ju&s;e touch the Horizon, be taken no|tice
of and &s;et down; and the time when the under Limb of the Sun ju&s;t
touches the Horizon in the Evening be con&s;tantly ob&s;erv'd, it will be ea&s;y
to know what Hour and Minute by the &s;aid Clock, will denote either the
<PB N="493" REF="472">
Hour of Twelve at Noon, or the Hour of Twelve at Night; that is, when
the Sun &s;hall be in the Meridian of the place; for by halfing the time inter|jacent
between the Ri&s;ing and Setting, or between the Setting and Ri&s;ing,
you have the time of the Sun's being in the Meridian to be &s;hewn by the &s;aid
Clock; and, if it be de&s;ir'd, the Clock may, by this way, be daily adju&s;ted to the
Meridian of the place. As &s;uppo&s;e by the Clock (not yet adju&s;ted to the
Meridian of the place, but yet going equally and adju&s;ted to the length of
the Day) in be ob&s;erv'd, that the Sun in Setting ju&s;t touches the Horizon at
1h. 26'. by the Hand of the Clock, and that the next Morning, when the Sun
in Ri&s;ing be ju&s;t got clear above the Horizon, the Hand of the Clock points
at 11. 48'. it will be ea&s;y to find what Hour, by the Hand of the &s;aid Clock
&s;o continuing moving without altering or &s;etting the Hand, &s;hall denote the
Hour of Twelve for the following Day; for halfing the time between 1h. 26'.
and 11h. 48'. which is 10h. 22'. you have 6h. 37'. for the Hour of Noon the
following Day; for half the difference between 1h. 26'. and 11. 48'. being 5h. 11'. this being added to 1h. 26'. the Hour of Setting will &s;hew the time of
Midnight to be by the Clock 6h. 37'. and con&s;equently the Hour will be the
&s;ame when the Sun will be in the Meridian the next Day. Again&s;t this way
it may be Objected,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Objection again&s;t this way obviated.</NOTE> That tho' the Clock be adju&s;ted to the middle motion of the Sun,
yet that That will not be true for the length of any Day in the Year with|out
regard to the reaper Aequation of Time for the Day of Ob&s;ervation.
This I grant is &s;o; but as the difference between the length of any one
Day and any other is not very great, &s;o will this difference be yet much le&s;s
con&s;iderable, if it be made u&s;e of for to &s;hew them, when is the time to ob&s;erve
the height of the Sun in the Meridian; and not much more con&s;iderable, if
the knowing the time when the Sun is in the Meridian, the Line of North
and South be to be found, or the variation of the Needle; but yet if it he
thought nece&s;&s;ary or con&s;iderable, it is ea&s;ily provided again&s;t by a Table of
Aequation of Time.</P>
<P>But then there may be a Second Objection made again&s;t<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;econd Ob|jection obviat|ed.</NOTE> this way, and
that is, that a Ship being &s;uppos'd under Sail doth continually alter either
its Latitude, or its Longitude, or both; and &s;o, tho' the Clock &s;o ob&s;erv'd
and adju&s;ted, would at Land, or when the Ship lies at Anchor, &s;erve to
find the time when the Sun is in the Meridian, yet, by rea&s;on of this mo|tion
and progre&s;&s;ion of the Ship, the direction this way obtain'd cannot be
ju&s;t. This I grant is al&s;o a real cau&s;e of variety, and much greater than the
former; yet 'tis not &s;o great, but that it may be provided again&s;t, allow|ance
being made for the &s;ame according as the ca&s;e &s;hall require; for by the
Cour&s;e Steer'd in the mean time, and the progre&s;s in that Cour&s;e being ta|ken
notice of by the common way of keeping the Cour&s;e, and di&s;tance Sail'd
by the Logline and Compa&s;s, it will be ea&s;y to know, near enough for this
purpo&s;e, what allowances are to be made, both in regard of the alterations
of one and the other; and &s;o the time of Noon (when the Sun is in the Me|ridian)
may be accurately enough (for all u&s;es at Sea) known and ob&s;erv'd.
And as this may &s;erve to find the time, when the Sun is in the Meridian, in
the Day, &s;o may it &s;erve to find the time when any notable Star, who&s;e right
A&s;cen&s;ion is known, comes to the Meridian at Night; and &s;o con&s;equently
(the declination of the Star being al&s;o known) of finding the Latitude of the
place, by taking the Altitude of the &s;aid Star, when thus known, to be in
the Meridian.&mdash;Which is the &s;econd way of finding the Meridian by the
help of Caele&s;tial Bodies in the Night.</P>
<P>Now as the Meridian may be found by Stars, with the help of &s;uch a Clock,
&s;o may it be found out by the Amplitudes of their Ri&s;ing and Setting, or
their Azymuths ob&s;erv'd with an Azymuth Compa&s;s, when they are found
to be of the &s;ame Altitude, before they come to, and after they have pa&s;s'd
the Meridian; the &s;ame methods being us'd, as I have already &s;hewn, are
nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erv'd in finding the Meridian by the Sun.</P>
<P><PB N="494" REF="473">
A Fourth way of finding the Meridian Line by the help of Caele&s;tial Bo|dies
is by &s;uch of the fixt Stars near either of the Poles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A fourth way of finding the Meridian by the Stars near the Pole.</NOTE> as in the place where
the Ob&s;ervation is to be made, do neither Ri&s;e nor Set, but continually ap|pear
above the Horizon; this is done by noting their greate&s;t Ea&s;tern and
We&s;tern Digre&s;&s;ions, by the help of an Azymuth Compa&s;s; for by compar|ing
tho&s;e two together, and halving the difference, the Meridian Line is
ea&s;ily known, and at the &s;ame time the variation of the Needle for the place,
where &s;uch Ob&s;ervations &s;hall be made. Now the Times and Po&s;itions of
the&s;e Stars, when in their greate&s;t Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern Digre&s;&s;ion, may be
ea&s;ily found, if the Day of the Year be known, and the right A&s;cen&s;ions and
Declinations, of tho&s;e Stars be al&s;o known, and a Mapp be at hand to &s;hew
the Situation of tho&s;e Stars in re&s;pect of one another, and in re&s;pect of the
Polar Point, about which they &s;eem to move; which is in part done in the
In&s;trument call'd the Nocturnal. In making the&s;e Ob&s;ervations al&s;o, &s;uch a
Clock, as I but now mention'd, will be of very good u&s;e to find the time pre|ci&s;ely,
when they are in their greate&s;t Elongation from the Meridian.</P>
<P>The&s;e are (among multitudes of ways that have been propo&s;ed by A&s;trono|mers,
Geographers, and Natural Writers) the mo&s;t ea&s;y, plain, and obvious
ways to be under&s;tood and practis'd by any one, not otherwi&s;e skill'd in A|&s;tronomy,
nay, mo&s;t of them even without knowing the Latitude of the place
where the Ob&s;ervation is made, or the declination of the Sun, or place of
the Planets or fixt Stars; which I have cho&s;en the rather, becau&s;e to me they
&s;eem more &s;imple and praevious to them all; and therefore I cho&s;e fir&s;t to
di&s;cour&s;e and explain them, after the ways of finding the Meridian, and con|&s;equently
the variation of the Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>The next thing that is to be obtain'd by Ob&s;ervations of Caele&s;tial Bodies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of finding the Latitude.</NOTE>
is the Latitude of the place, or the di&s;tance of that place either Northwards
or Southwards from the Aequinoctial Line. This is found various ways, both
in the Day by the Sun, and in the Night by the Stars; and that with much ea&s;e
after the true Meridian by the former method, and con&s;equently the varia|tion
of the Compa&s;s for the place of inquiry, are fir&s;t known; for by means
of the Compa&s;s, &s;o examin'd, the true Meridian Line is continually pointed
out upon the Sea; and &s;o it will ea&s;ily appear when the Sun or Stars are in
that Azymuth. The &s;ame thing is al&s;o found by the afore&s;aid Clock; then
the declination of the Sun, or the true place of the Sun, for that time, being
known for the Day, and the declination of the Star, to be ob&s;erv'd, being
known for the Night Ob&s;ervation, both which are expre&s;s'd in Tables cal|culated
for that purpo&s;e, by ob&s;erving the Altitude of either, when in the
Meridian, above the Horizon, and making allowance for the declination of
the Body &s;o ob&s;erv'd, either by Addition or Subduction, as the Ca&s;e requires,
you find the height of the Aequinoctial Circle, which is the &s;ame with the di|&s;tance
of the Pole from the Zenith, the Complement of which is the Altitude
of the Polar Point of the Heaven, or the di&s;tance of the Zenith of the place
from the Aequinoctial Circle in the Heaven, or the Latitude of the place
from the Line or Aequinoctial, &s;uppos'd to be drawn upon the Earth.</P>

<P>THe Per&s;ection of A&s;tronomy (a Science that has been cultivated in all

much upon the knowledge of the di&s;tance of tho&s;e Caele&s;tial Bodies, who&s;e
ways we would know, and who&s;e motions, and velocities we would calculate.
Of which how certain we hitherto are, we need go no farther to be &s;atisfy'd

accuratene&s;s requir'd both in their Calculations and Ob&s;ervations, and next
the uncertainty of the Horizontal Refraction; and 'till this la&s;t be brought
to a very great degree of accuratene&s;s and certainty, it is not to be expected
that we &s;hall every certainly know the true di&s;tance of the Planets by the mo&s;t
accurate Calculations and Ob&s;ervations imaginable;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cau&s;e the&s;e of from the $word$.</NOTE> for not to &s;tay now on
the con&s;ideration of what I &s;hall by and by more largely manife&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> the
&s;mall and &s;uddain mutations of the internal parts of the Air from Heat and
Cold, and Winds and Rains, and the like; we may from the differing Gra|vitation
of the Atmo&s;phere, which has been ob&s;erv'd from the ri&s;ing and fal|ling
of the Quick&s;ilver in the Torricellian Experiments to be very con&s;iderable,
namely, almo&s;t a fourteenth greater at &s;ome times than at others; we may,
I &s;ay, from hence collect how uncertain the Refractions, mu&s;t be, which are
caus'd by &s;o un&s;table and uncertain a Medium. If therefore we that are
thus plac'd this in Atmo&s;phere, have yet a mind to know as much as could
be known of tho&s;e great Works of the Creator that &s;eem to whirle about us and
incompa&s;s us, we &s;hould, for that end, fir&s;t con&s;ider well, and indeavour to ac|quaint
our &s;elves with the Nature of the Air or Medium through which we
look, that lying the fir&s;t Ob&s;tacle in our way towards tho&s;e Bodies, we would
contemplate. And therefore the examination of the Nature of this tran&s;|parent
Medium which thus incompa&s;&s;es us, and through which we are fain
to &s;ee all the Caele&s;tial Bodies as through a Gla&s;s Window, will de&s;erve and
require our indeavours in the fir&s;t place; for being ignorant of the Nature of
this ambient pellucid Body, it will be very difficult to determine any thing
po&s;itively and exactly about the di&s;tance and true place of the Planets. And
to this end I do not at all like their way of examining it, who fir&s;t choo&s;e an
<PB N="496" REF="475">
Hypothe&s;is of the Planets di&s;tance, and from that collect the height of the
Air and the Refraction of it, and by that means reconcile what Parallax they
plea&s;e to the Planet they ob&s;erve. Nor yet their way who fancying an ima|ginary
Surface of the Air, at I know not what height, and there giving it an
arbitrary refractive Quality, &s;till make the Refraction of the Air as would re|concile
all their Theories and Ob&s;ervations. Nor theirs who, from the Ec|clip&s;e
of the Moon and &s;hadow of the Earth, collect great matters; for (as I
&s;hall anon &s;hew) all tho&s;e Phaenomena may be explicated, tho' the Diameter
of the Sun be no bigger, nay, tho' much le&s;s than that of the Earth, by
means of the Refraction in the Atmo&s;phere, we being hitherto uncertain how
great it may be, and 'till we are a&s;&s;ur'd of it nothing can be concluded as to
the di&s;tance of the Sun or Moon from the Ecclip&s;es. But I rather therefore
&s;uppo&s;e it nece&s;&s;ary for him that will know the true Nature of the Air as to
Refraction, and the true Parallax or Di&s;tance of the Caele&s;tial Bodies, to go
quite other ways to work to find each of them a part. And for the exami|nation
of the Air it will be requi&s;ite to collect and examine as many Phaeno|mena
of that kind as can be met with all. Such as the&s;e I &s;hall now acquaint
you with. It has been often ob&s;erv'd, by the naked Eye, that the Sun and
Moon, when near the Horizon, appear oval; but &s;ince the Invention&mdash;</P>
<P>The remainder of this Lecture is lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I did the la&s;t Term indeavour to &s;hew, from very many Experiments and
Ob&s;ervations, that the Air or Atmo&s;phere, wherewith we are incompa&s;s'd,
had in it two Proprieties not taken notice of before, which, 'till they were
well under&s;tood, examin'd and regulated, would &s;o far &s;poil all the mo&s;t ac|curate
Horizontal Observations that were not &s;omewhat regulated according
to them, that there could be no certain deductions from them of the Di&s;tance
or Parallax of any Caele&s;tial Body; no, not of the Moon it&s;elf, which is
neare&s;t to us, and con&s;equently has the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Parallax: For I then
&s;hew'd, that notwith&s;tanding all the Affirmations, and Theories, and Cal|culations,
and Ob&s;ervations of the be&s;t and mo&s;t accurate A&s;tronomers, it
was po&s;&s;ible to &s;olve all the Phaenomena, tho' the Moon, for in&s;tance, were
&s;uppos'd not above a third part of the di&s;tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Inflecti|on of the At|mo&s;phere.</NOTE> &s;he is commonly by them &s;up|pos'd

bend tho&s;e Rays before they come to the Eye, that 'tis hardly po&s;&s;ible by
the mo&s;t accurate and diligent Ob&s;ervations that can be made in any one
place, to regulate one already rais'd Hypothe&s;is, or to found and e&s;tabli&s;h a
new one; and therefore I &s;hew'd, that certainly the be&s;t way to redre&s;s this
inconvenience, will be to get certain Ob&s;ervatioas made of the way of the
Moon among the &s;mall or Tele&s;copical fixt Stars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two ob&s;ervers at a di&s;tance to ob&s;erve the Moon's place among the fixt Stars.</NOTE> by two Per&s;ons very far

one and the &s;ame Meridian as to Longitude; each of which two Per&s;ons &s;hould
ob&s;erve exactly with an excellent Tele&s;cope fitted with a divided Ruler, the way
of the Moon among the &s;mall fixt Stars; and thereby we &s;hould (by fir&s;t regu|lating

would be ea&s;y very to know al&s;o what mu&s;t be her Parallax in all Altitudes a|bove

of the Parallax of the Altitude of the Moon, to know, by the Ob|&s;ervation,
what is the then &s;en&s;ible Inflection of the Rays.</P>
<P>For the performing of which Ob&s;ervations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Requi&s;ites for this Ob&s;erva|tion.</NOTE> there &s;eem to be very many
things requi&s;ite, which I &s;hall indeavour to explain. And the fir&s;t is a good
Tele&s;cope about &s;ome ten or twelve Foot long; for this, if it be well fitted
into a &s;mall and light Tube, is ea&s;ily enough managable by any one &s;ingle
Per&s;on without much trouble. This Tele&s;cope is be&s;t adapted for Caele&s;tial
Ob&s;ervations, if it have only at that end which is next the Eye, one pretty
<PB N="497" REF="476">
deep Convex Cry&s;talline Gla&s;s well Poli&s;h'd and of clear Mettle; for there|by
the Objects will appear much plainer and di&s;tincter, tho' there cannot be
&s;o much &s;een at a time, as through a Tele&s;cope fitted with two, or more
Convex Eye-gla&s;&s;es: Then to fit this In&s;trument for the Ob&s;ervation of the
Diameters of the &Sun; &Moon; &Saturn; &Jupit; &Mars; &Venus; or &Merc;, the mo&s;t convenient and mo&s;t ea&s;y
way is to take a &s;mall piece of Wire, and to place it &s;o within the Tube, at
&s;uch a convenient di&s;tance from the Eye-gla&s;s, that the Eye indeavouring to
look, through the Tube may ice it mo&s;t di&s;tinctly; that is, it mu&s;t be plac'd
within the Tube ju&s;t in the focus of that Eye-gla&s;s; then having by the Eye
found the true di&s;tance of this Ruler to take it out and divide it into Inches,
and Decimal parts of Inches, cutting with the edge of a Knife, or the like,
very &s;mall cro&s;s Strokes or Gutters, in each of tho&s;e Divi&s;ions, and every
fifth or tenth Notch, to cut much deeper, &s;o to make it more con&s;picu|ous.
Having thus divided and mark'd it, this Ruler or Wire &s;hould be a|gain
put into its place, and the Tube directed again&s;t &s;ome Star in or near
the Aequator, and in that Po&s;ition &s;o fixt, that the motion of that Star may
be plainly ob&s;erv'd pa&s;&s;ing along by the divided Ruler. Then having &s;o a|dapted
it, there &s;hould be provided a Pendulum made with a Thread and
Plummet and adju&s;ted to &s;uch a length, as may make it vibrate once every
&s;econd Minute of Time; having this ready, the next thing to be done, is
to place the Tube &s;o, as that the Star may appear ju&s;t coming into the
Gla&s;s, then fixing the Tube, and ob&s;erving 'till the Star be ju&s;t upon one of
the Divi&s;ions, let go the Pendulum, and ob&s;erve the pa&s;&s;age of the Star a|long
by the Ruler, 'till by the vibration of the Pendulum you find a minute
of Time pa&s;t, or any other determinate number of Seconds you &s;hall think
fit, ob&s;erving exactly how many Divi&s;ions on the Ruler the Star has pa&s;t by
in that time; for by this means it will be exceeding ea&s;y to ob&s;erve how ma|ny
of tho&s;e Decimal divi&s;ions an&s;wer to the Subten&s;e of a Minute of a De|gree;
for &s;ince we know that the motion of tho&s;e Stars which are in, or ve|ry
near to the Aequinoctial, is near a Minute of Longitude in four Seconds
of Time, or a Degree of Longitude in four Minutes of Time, 'twill be very
ea&s;y by ob&s;erving the motion of the Star along the Ruler, and comparing in
with the Vibrations of a Pendulum, to find what length of the Ruler does
an&s;wer to a Minute, or the five Thou&s;and four Hundredth part of Quadrant;
which having found, it will be ea&s;y to place &s;everal divi&s;ions on the other
&s;ide of the Ruler, that each Minute may be divided into Seconds.</P>

been found to an&s;wer to a Minute; for having, by the Pendulum, found
the Star to have mov'd from K to E in twenty Seconds of Time, it is mani|fe&s;t,
if that di&s;tance be divided into five equal parts, each of the&s;e mu&s;t

<P>Now, becau&s;e for making a compleat Hoop or Zone of all the fix'd Stars
In the Zodiack, the Angle afforded by the help of a &s;ingle Tele&s;cope, is not
&s;ufficient for taking the true di&s;tance of Stars when many Degrees remov'd
from each other; therefore for &s;uch kind of Ob&s;ervations there is an In&s;tru|ment
which by the opening or &s;hutting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A double Te|le&s;cope for $ak|ing Angles, this is after|wards de&s;crib'd</NOTE> or the moving of two &s;ix Foot Te|le&s;copes

which mea&s;ures the Angle they make with each other, when any two Stars, by
two Ob&s;ervators, are at the &s;ame in&s;tant &s;een through tho&s;e two Tubes;
which In&s;trument I &s;hall, on &s;ome other occa&s;ion, de&s;cribe; for it is indeed
one of the be&s;t for the ob&s;ervations of the di&s;tances and places of the Stars that
has been yet thought on, and may &s;erve al&s;o for mea&s;uring the Diameters of
the Sun and Moon, tho' nothing near &s;o exactly as the newly mention'd
twelve Foot Tele&s;cope; for by the divided Ruler the Diameter of the Pla|nets
may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd even to Seconds. Wherefore, if by means of Ob|&s;ervations
made at very far remov'd Stations, we can be a&s;&s;ur'd of the di|&s;tance
of any of the Planets, and by this means, at the &s;ame time, we have
the apparent Diameter of that Body, it will be exceeding ea&s;y at any other
time, by ob&s;erving the apparent Diameter with this Tube, to know the
then true di&s;tance of the Planet at that time al&s;o; for the &s;ines of the ap|parent
Angles of the Diameter, and the re&s;pective di&s;tances will be very near
reciprocal; that is, as the &s;ine of the apparent Angle of the Body in the &s;e|cond
Ob&s;ervation, to the &s;ine of the apparent Angle in the fir&s;t, &s;o the di|&s;tance

the apparent Angle of the Moon's Semidiameter; let DE repre&s;ent the
apparent Semidimameter of the Moon in its Apogeum; EAD the Angle
under which it appears. Then on A, and the di&s;tance AC de&s;cribe the Circle
CFG, and from F draw FG Perpendicular to AD; I &s;ay, as FG the fine of
the apparent Diameter in the &s;econd Ob&s;ervation to BC the fine of the ap|parent
Diameter in the fir&s;t; &s;o is AC to AE; that is, &s;o is the Radius of
the le&s;&s;er Circle of di&s;tance to the Radius of the greater, that is, very near
as the le&s;&s;er di&s;tance of the Center of the Planet is to the greater di&s;tance of
the Center of the Planet: For DE is very near equal to CB by the &s;uppo&s;i|tion,
as being the vi&s;ible Diameter of the &s;ame Body; tho' why 'tis otherwi&s;e
I &s;hall by and by &s;hew; and AC is equal to AF, as being the Rays of the
&s;ame Circle; therefore by the &s;econd of the &s;ixth Book of <HI>Euclid,</HI> as FG to
ED, that is, to CB; &s;o is AF, that is AC to AE; which AC and AE give
the di&s;tance of the Center of the Planet from the Eye much more exactly than
the Lines AB or AD; tho' neither of them are exact but both &s;omewhat le&s;s
than the truth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 8. Fig. 7</NOTE> To demon&s;trate which let DEF in the &s;eventh Figure repre|&s;ent
the Body of the Sun, Moon, or other Planet, A the Eye, B the Cen|ter
of that Body, AB the true di&s;tance of that Center from the Eye, DAB
half the apparent Angle of the Body, AD a tangent Ray that touches the Globe
DEF in D; from D let fall the Perpendicular DC on AB. I &s;ay then, that
the Line AD &s;hall be much nearer an equality to AB than AC; for by the
eighteenth of the third of <HI>Euclid,</HI> ADB &s;hall be a right Angle, and the
Angle ACD is a right Angle by the Con&s;truction, and the Angle DAC is
common to both Triangles; therefore as AC to AD, &s;o AD to AB: AD
therefore will be a mean proportional between AC and AB, and con&s;equent|ly
will be nearer to an equality with AB than AC will be. Nor is the vi&s;ible
Diameter of a Globe exactly the &s;ame at a nearer and farther di&s;tance, as
I even now hinted: Nor indeed is it at any time exactly the true, but tho'
the appearing Diameter be really always le&s;s than the true Diameter, yet, does
it always &s;ubtend a bigger Angle at the Eye.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 9. Fig. 2.</NOTE> To demon&s;trate which, let us
&s;uppo&s;e DEH to &s;ignify a great Circle drawn en the Body of the Moon, or
other Globular Body, A the Eye, DC the Semidiameter of the vi&s;ible part,
BG the true Semidiameter or the Body. I &s;ay therefore fir&s;t, that DC is
really le&s;s, tho' it appear bigger to the Eye than BG; for drawing the Line
BD in the Triangle BCD, the Angle C is a right Angle, and con&s;equently BD
is bigger than DC, therefore DC is le&s;s than BG which is equal to BD. But Se|condly,
I &s;ay, that DC &s;ubtends a greater Angle at the Eye than BG; for AD
being by the &s;uppo&s;ition a tangent to the Circle at D, a Line, as AG drawn from
any other point of the Semicircle HGE to the point A, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily di|vide
the Angle DAC into two parts, DAG and. GAC; therefore GAC be|ing
but a part is le&s;s than the whole DAC. Further, I &s;ay, of the apparent
Diameters at &s;everal Di&s;tances, that the &s;horter di&s;tance has always really the
&s;horter apparent Diameter, but that that &s;horter Diameter does &s;ub&s;tend a big|ger
Angle at the Eye. That the &s;horter di&s;tance has really the &s;horter vi&s;ible
Diameter, is evident, becau&s;e the Bodies are Globular. To demon&s;trate
which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. $. Fig. 3.</NOTE> &s;uppo&s;e ADFG, in the third Figure, to be a plain pa&s;&s;ing through the
Eye and the Center of the Sun. Let A be the Eye farther remov'd, and B
the Eye nearer plac'd to C the Center of the Sun. DEFH therefore be|ing
the inter&s;ection of this Plain, and the Superficies of the Sun or Planet
will repre&s;ent a greater Circle on that Body. From the Points A and B
draw the Lines AE and AH and BDBJ; which may touch the Circle in EH,
D and I, and from the&s;e two points draw the Lines EH and DI. I &s;ay there|fore
fir&s;t, that the Diameter EH. of the Disk, of the Sun apparent to the Eye
A, is bigger than DJ the Diameter of the Disk, apparent to the Eye B; for
drawing the Lines EC and DC, HC and IC, 'tis evident DCJ is le&s;s than
ECH, and con&s;equently by the fifteenth of the third of <HI>Euclids Elem.</HI> that
DI is le&s;s than EH. Next, I &s;ay, that the apparent Diameter DJ &s;ubtends
a bigger Angle at B than EH does; for BD and BI being tangents to the
Circle DGI, what&s;oever Lines are drawn from the point B to any point
of the Circle, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be drawn between BD and BJ, and con&s;e|quently
<PB N="500" REF="479">
any two of them mu&s;t make a le&s;&s;er Angle than DBJ. But to omit
the&s;e Niceties, which indeed are &s;o incon&s;iderable in the ob&s;ervation of the
Di&s;tance or Diameter of the Sun or Moon, and much more of the other
&s;maller Planets, that with the mo&s;t accurate In&s;truments that the Art of
Man hath hitherto invented, they will hardly be di&s;cernable, as not amount|ing
to 1/10000 part of the Diameter of the Sun or Moon, when bigge&s;t, as
may be &s;een by a Table of Natural Sines: It will be therefore &s;uficiently ex|act
to make the Diameters and Di&s;tances Reciprocal. So that if by a good
Tele&s;cope order'd, as I have directed, the apparent Diameters be heedfully
ob&s;erv'd, we may, &s;uppo&s;ing any one di&s;tance known, by means of two Ob|&s;ervators,
ea&s;ily enough know the di&s;tance at any time, and con&s;equently
the pre&s;ent Parallax, and from that the Refraction, or rather Inflection of
the Rays in the Atmo&s;phere: We mu&s;t therefore rectify our Refractions or
Inflections, caus'd by the interpos'd Air, by our certain fore-knowledge of
the pre&s;ent Parallax.</P>
<P>And this Method, tho' it be &s;omewhat praepo&s;erous to the ways yet
practis'd by the be&s;t A&s;tronomers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to know the Moens Or|bit exactly.</NOTE> is certainly the mo&s;t Natural; for having
once the certain Parallax of the Moon, we may very ea&s;ily, from Ob&s;ervations,
collect exactly in what kind of Line or Orbits he is mov'd about the Earth,
and with what Velocity in what parts of that Orbit, and con&s;equently from
&s;ome few Ob&s;ervations, her true motions may be known, which we are hi|therto
not &s;o &s;ure of; and thence con&s;equently 'twill be no difficult matter
to Compo&s;e and Con&s;titute a true and real Theory of the motion of the
Moon, and to calculate Tables accordingly; which, tho' it has been hither|to
pretended by very many, yet o'tiil &s;ome &s;uch Cour&s;e as this be taken for
the regulating of Ob&s;ervations, I fear 'twill not be in ha&s;t done. From which
Tables, and a Hoop, or Zone of all the Tele&s;copical Stars as well as vi&s;ible,
what could be le&s;s expected than an ea&s;y way for finding of the Longitudes of
places? For 'twould be no more difficulty to know the true Longitude of any
place then by a fix Foot Tele&s;cope, which is very ea&s;ily manageable at Sea to
make an Ob&s;ervation of the appul&s;e of the Moon to &s;ome fixt Star in that
Zone, and from tho&s;e exact Tables to calculate at what time that &s;hould be
in the place for who&s;e Meridian they are calculated, and at the &s;ame time to
what a Clock 'twere in that place where the Ob&s;ervation Is made.</P>
<P>Having, by this means,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To get a true Theory of the sun and the Eccliptick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> got the true Theory of the A Moon, it will be &s;o
much the ea&s;ier to find out the true Theory of the Sun; for by that of the
Moon we &s;hall be able to know the Inflection of the Rays in the Air, and
con&s;equently the Parallax of the Sun, if &s;en&s;ible, will be quickly found, and
having its apparent Diameter mea&s;ur'd with a good Tele&s;cope at that time
when the Parallax was calculated, it will be very ea&s;y from the apparent Dia|meter
of the &s;ame at any other time, thro' the &s;ame or any other Tele&s;cope
fitted accordingly, to know the true Parallax of the Sun at the time of the
Ob&s;ervation; and con&s;equently both the Obliquity of the Eccliptick will be
exactly known, and the place or Velocity of the Sun in that Eccliptick (or of
the Earth in its Orbit which is all one) will be more ea&s;ily found, which be|cau&s;e
the ways hitherto us'd of ob&s;erving only the Meridian Altitudes, are
not &s;o accurate as might be de&s;ir'd, I &s;hall propound a way which I think will
be very ea&s;ily practicable, and will afford mo&s;t certain information of the ap|parent
place of the Sun as to its Po&s;itions among the fix'd Stars at all times;
and con&s;equently a Year or two's Ob&s;ervations, made after this manner, will
very exactly in&s;truct one how to make exact Tables of the Velocity of the
Sun or Earth in the Eccliptick, and con&s;equently to be the better enabl'd to
rai&s;e a true Theory of the motion of the Sun or Earth; and &s;o to be able
more exactly to calculate the Ecclip&s;es of both the Luminaries, and to foretel
all the vi&s;ible Phaenomena of the Po&s;itions of tho&s;e two Bodies one to another.</P>
<P>The way I propounded is this, Fir&s;t, To get in a convenient place for Ob|&s;ervation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ways to find the Meridian.</NOTE>
an exactly true Meridian Line drawn. This may be done very
many ways, &s;ome more ea&s;y, others more exact: The mo&s;t ea&s;y and plain
way, and which is pretty exact al&s;o, if the Sun be near either of the Tro|picks,
is by procuring a large &s;mooth Plain, which mu&s;t be exactly level'd
Horizontally and fixt in that Po&s;ition; then finding the middle part and tak|ing
<PB N="501" REF="480">
there a Point, de&s;cribe about that Point, at &s;everal di&s;tances, &s;everal Cir|cles
one le&s;s than another; then erecting a Perpendicular &s;tile in the Center,
and ob&s;erving a Morning and Afternoon &s;hadow of the Sun, where the &s;ha|dow
of the top touches the &s;ame Circle in two di&s;tant places, and dividing
the interpos'd Arch between tho&s;e two parts into two equal parts, a Line
drawn through that middle Point &s;o found, and the Center of the Plain will
give the true Meridian or North and South Line of the place.</P>
<P>And this &s;uppo&s;ing the Sun near the Tropick of <HI>Cancer</HI> or <HI>Capricorn</HI> will be
pretty near the true Meridian. But in this Ob&s;ervation care &s;hould be had,
that the Sun be pretty much elevated above the Horizon, before the &s;ha|dow
he ob&s;erv'd, becau&s;e of the varying Refractions at &s;everal times of
the &s;ame Day. The Meridian likewi&s;e may be found when the Sun is in ei|ther
of the Aequinoxes, by ob&s;erving any two &s;hadows of the Stile, and
drawing a Line through them, and then to that Line from the Center,
drawing another Line at right Angles; for this Perpendicular Line &s;hall be
in or very near the Meridian of the place.</P>
<P>A third way, but not &s;o certain as either, may be, by a pretty large Mag|netical
Needle, &s;uffer'd to play or move upon a very &s;harp Point; for in
many places, as at the pre&s;ent, here in <HI>London,</HI> the Needle will, by the Mag|neti&s;m
of the Earth, be directed very near the North and South Line of the
place. But none of all the&s;e being exact, the two fir&s;t being uncertain, by
rea&s;on of the annual motion of the Sun or Earth; and this la&s;t by rea&s;on of
the variation of the Magnetical direction of the Needle, 't will be requi&s;ite
to make u&s;e of &s;ome other that is more accurate.</P>
<P>And among the&s;e may be reckon'd the way by taking the Altitude and A|zymuth
of any known Star, which will require the calculation of a Triangle
or two; or to ob&s;erve the Azymuth of any Star when it is in the &s;ame
Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern height; or, which is be&s;t of all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mo&s;t exact way.</NOTE> to ob&s;erve Azymuths
of the mo&s;t Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern excur&s;ions of a Star within or near the Ar|tick
Circle, which, how it may be&s;t be done, I &s;hall &s;hew in my next Di&s;|cour&s;e,
as likewi&s;e de&s;cribe &s;ome u&s;eful In&s;truments for A&s;tronomical Ob|&s;ervations.</P>
<P>I did, the la&s;t Day, propound three things that were requi&s;ite for the
Perfection of A&s;tronomical Theories by Ob&s;ervations; and they are &s;uch as&punc;
without which, we &s;hall have but little certainty of any Hypothe&s;is what&s;o|ever.
And indeed they were &s;uch as &s;hould never be &s;eperate; for either of
them being wanting, the other would be imperfect: And therefore when|&s;oever
any Ob&s;ervation is made of the one without taking notice of the o|ther,
that Ob&s;ervation mu&s;t need be imperfect and in&s;ignificant. The things
to be ob&s;erv'd, I &s;hew'd, were three; the fir&s;t was the true di&s;tance of the
Body, who&s;e way and motion was to be ob&s;erv'd from the Center of the
Earth; the only accurate way of doing which, I &s;hew'd, was by means of
two Ob&s;ervators very far remov'd from each other on the Surface of the
Earth. I &s;hew'd al&s;o, that the mo&s;t convenient places, for &s;uch &s;tations,
would be &s;ome two places as far remov'd from each other in point of Lati|tude,
as could be conveniently found, and as near under the &s;ame Meridian
or Degree of Longitude. That their belt method of Ob&s;ervation would be to
begin with the Moon, and to find her true di&s;tance; and next with the Sun,
ob&s;erving at the &s;ame time their apparent Diameters; for by that means I
&s;hew'd how the apparent Diameter of any one known di&s;tance being given,
the true di&s;tance, at any other times, would be ea&s;ily found from the ap|parent
Diameters, and that therefore there needed no more trouble but
only to ob&s;erve the apparent Diameters by means of a good Tele&s;cope;
and the true di&s;tance might, by Calculation, be pre&s;ently known; for I then
&s;hew'd, that the apparent Magnitude of the Diameter, and the di&s;tances
were Reciprocal. I &s;hew'd likewi&s;e by what means a Tele&s;cope might be &s;o
prepar'd as to be fit for &s;uch Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>And therefore it were extreamly de&s;irable, that &s;ome, who&s;e lei&s;ure would
permit them, would &s;et upon this Work, and if they were not able to go
through with the whole, to indeavour to do as much as were requi&s;ite for
<PB N="502" REF="481">
the Ob&s;ervations to be afterwards made, of the ways and motions of the
Planets.</P>
<P>And for this end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fixt Stars in the Zodiack to be ob&s;erv'd.</NOTE> if they did only regulate exactly all the places of the Stars
within, or pretty near the Zodiack, that were either of the fir&s;t, &s;econd,
or third Magnitude; it would be &s;ufficient for any Ob&s;ervations that were
to be made of the Planets, e&s;pecially if the Ob&s;ervator were furni&s;h'd with
an In&s;trument which I the la&s;t Day mention'd, and promis'd then more ful|ly
to de&s;cribe; and that is with a double Tele&s;cope, as I may &s;o call it, or
an In&s;trument, which, by means only of two Tele&s;copes, mov'd on a Joint,
and a Ruler divided by a Line of Chords an&s;werable to the length of the
Tele&s;copes, does, by the help of two Ob&s;ervators, ea&s;ily and mo&s;t exactly
determine the Angle of di&s;tance of any two Objects. This In&s;trument was
invented by Sir <HI>Chri&s;t. Wren,</HI> a Per&s;on &s;o eminent in all kind of Knowledge,
and mo&s;t e&s;pecially in Mathematical and Mechanical, that the naming him
the Author will be a &s;ufficient commendation of the In&s;trument it&s;elf. O|mitting
therefore any further Prai&s;es of it, I &s;hall indeavour, in as few
words as may be to de&s;cribe the In&s;trument it&s;elf, and the &s;everal parts of
it, the manner of rectifying it and u&s;ing it for any Caele&s;tial Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The In&s;trument con&s;i&s;ts of two &s;quare Tubes or Boxes AB,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De&s;cription of the double Te|le&s;cope. Tab.</HI> 11. <HI>Fig.</HI> 1.</NOTE> and CD, which
are each of them at B and D furni&s;h'd with a good Object-gla&s;s of &s;ix Foot,
and at the other ends A and C are likewi&s;e furni&s;h'd with a very deep Lens
or Eye-gla&s;s MN; each of them al&s;o have a &s;mall Cell to keep the Eye at a
due di&s;tance from the Gla&s;s; and at a convenient di&s;tance within tho&s;e Eye-gla&s;&s;es,
as about O and P, are plac'd two &s;mall Plates of Bra&s;s, out of which
a round hole is cut in the manner of the Figure R, only leaving a &s;mall Tri|angle,
who&s;e Point ju&s;t comes to the Center or middle of this Circle at S;
this I call the Sight, the u&s;e of which I &s;hall by and by de&s;cribe. The&s;e two
Tubes, thus fitted, are join'd together by a very firm Joint at E; which
Joint is made &s;o &s;trong and &s;o exact, that the Tubes always, whether open or
&s;hut, keep in the &s;ame Plain: The&s;e Tubes, being thus join'd, are fir&s;t recti|fy'd
to an exact Paralleli&s;m one with another, by being directed &s;o again&s;t
&s;ome Star, and mov'd to and fro 'till the Star be &s;een through both of them
at the &s;ame time to touch the Apex or Corner of the Triangle in the Sight;
at which time, by means of a contrivance at the other end, they are fix'd in
that Paralleli&s;m; &s;o that again&s;t what&s;oever Star one of them be directed,
the other will, in the &s;ame manner, be directed al&s;o; the conetrivance for
fixing the&s;e Tubes at the ends A and C, is this: On the Tube CD is fa&s;ten'd
a peice of Bra&s;s JK, at the end J, of which, is made a Center or Hole L, at
the &s;ame di&s;tance from the Tube that the Center E is of at the other end;
and on to the Tube AB is likewi&s;e plac'd a corre&s;ponding piece of Bra&s;s FG,
which is not &s;o fixt to the Tube as the other, but is made to &s;lide a little, as
occa&s;ion &s;hall require, between two pieces of Bra&s;s T and V, but &s;o as by
means of a &s;mall Screw H to be &s;uddainly fix'd in any po&s;ture; this piece of
Bra&s;s has likewi&s;e a &s;mall Center or Hole L, at the &s;ame di&s;tance as near as
may be, that the Center E is remov'd from the Tube AB; the&s;e two Centers
are both join'd together by means of a &s;mall Screw which pa&s;&s;es through both
of them; which being done the Screw H is loo&s;n'd, and the Tubes are, by
being both directed again&s;t the &s;ame Star, reduc'd to an exact Paralleli&s;m;
which being done, by the turning of the Screw H, the Plate FG is firmly fixt
in that po&s;ture to the Tube AB, and the In&s;trument is rectify'd for Ob&s;erva|tion.</P>
<P>This being done, the exact di&s;tance of the Centers E and L is mea&s;ur'd,
and by that di&s;tance as Radius a Ruler YY is divided, either into a Line of
Chords, or, which is better, into &s;uch equal parts whereof ten Thou&s;and
make the whole Radius; then the Screw being remov'd that held the two
Centers together at L, and two &s;mall Sockets $word$ &s;crew'd on, through which
this divided Ruler may &s;lide, the one on the Center of the Plate FG, the o|ther
on that of IK. And the one end of the Ruler being fix'd in one of the&s;e
Sockets, &s;o as the beginning of the divi&s;ions lies ju&s;t over the Center of it;
and the other part &s;liding in the other Socket, according as the Tubes are
more or le&s;s open'd from each other on the Center E; the two Ob&s;ervators
<PB N="503" REF="482">
are to direct each of them his own Tube to the Star, which they have a|greed
upon to ob&s;erve; &s;o that at the &s;ame time one directs his Tube to
one of tho&s;e Stars, the other directs his to the other Star, and when each
of them has at the &s;ame in&s;tant rectify'd his Tube to the Star, he ob&s;erves
&s;o that the Apex or Point of the Triangle in the &s;ight does ju&s;t touch the
Star, then he that has the Tube through who&s;e Socket the divided Ruler
&s;lides by turning a &s;mall Screw YZ, fixes tho&s;e Tubes in that po&s;ture, and by
the number of the equal divi&s;ions of the Ruler, which mea&s;ures the di&s;tance
of the two Centers, the apparent Angle or di&s;tance of tho&s;e two Stars, is
mo&s;t exactly found to Minutes. And indeed, by means of a &s;mall additional
contrivance, which I &s;hall el&s;ewhere &s;hew, it may not only be made to di|&s;tingui&s;h
Angles to Minutes but to Seconds al&s;o. Now this In&s;trument, be|&s;ides
this great exactne&s;s, has many other conveniences which may render it
very con&s;iderable; for it may be made very light, and is al&s;o exceeding ea&s;ily
manageable, and by being clos'd together takes up but a little room, and
may be ea&s;ily tran&s;ported from place to place, and made u&s;e of almo&s;t in any
Chamber; and indeed all Particulars con&s;ider'd, it is a worthy Product of its
excellent Inventor: By this, not only the places of the fixt Stars may be re|gulated,
but even the places of the Planets may mo&s;t exactly be found.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> Shall here add the De&s;cription of an In&s;trument for taking Angles at one Pro&s;pect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 11. Fig. 2.</NOTE>

<P>If therefore by the In&s;trument de&s;crib'd Page 502, all the Stars within or
near the Zodiack were regulated and a&s;&s;ertain'd, it would then be much
more &s;ecnre, taking the true di&s;tance of the Planets to be ob&s;erv'd from
them, and much more ea&s;y to find their true place in the Zodiack; and con|&s;equently
a much le&s;s number of &s;uch kind of Ob&s;ervations would &s;uffice to
determine their true Ways, Motions and Velocities. Now, tho' that emi|nent
A&s;tronomer <HI>Hevelius</HI> has promis'd &s;hortly to publi&s;h to the World a
perfect Catalogue, not only of all the fix'd Stars already taken notice of in
other Catalogues, but even of multitudes of others &s;ufficiently manife&s;t to
the naked Eye, yet we think that Expectation &s;hould no ways di&s;courage
any from making Ob&s;ervations him&s;elf, &s;ince, at belt, no Man can be &s;o &s;ure
of anothers Ob&s;ervations as of his own. And next, &s;ince it would not be a
labour of very great difficulty to regulate the places of all the Stars of the fir&s;t,
&s;econd and third Magnitude within or near the Zodiack, becau&s;e their num|ber
is not very great.</P>
<P>And, Thirdly, It cannot but be a great &s;atisfaction to any &s;uch Ob&s;er|vator
to find when tho&s;e others, promis'd by <HI>Hevelius,</HI> &s;hall be Publi&s;h'd,
that his own Ob&s;ervations do concur with tho&s;e of the other, or that he
is a&s;&s;ur'd that his own are more exact than tho&s;e.</P>
<P>But, Fourthly, And, molt e&s;pecially, he &s;hould not be deter'd, but much
rather excited, &s;ince without &s;uch Corrections of the places of the fixt Stars
nothing can be done in any other Caele&s;tial Ob&s;ervation, and con&s;equently
&s;uch a part of a Man's time, as to this de&s;ign, will be wholly lo&s;t.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ob&s;ervations in order to re|gulate the Pla|nets motions.</NOTE> But to
proceed with what I was &s;aying concerning the Ob&s;ervations requi&s;ite for the
regulation of the Theories of the Planets; I &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;ing the true places
of the fixt Stars, as to their Longitude and Latitude, were known, and &s;up|po&s;ing
we had, from di&s;tant Ob&s;ervations, the Moons true di&s;tance from
the Center of the Earth, and her apparent Diameter at that time, we
might ea&s;ily, by the Tele&s;cope, find her di&s;tance at all other times, and by
<PB N="504" REF="483">
her appul&s;e to certain Stars, or di&s;tance from them, together with the time
of the Ob&s;ervation and her apparent Diameter, we might ea&s;ily know her
true Po&s;ition among the fixt Stars, in re&s;pect of the Center of the Earth;
and if &s;uch Ob&s;ervations were continu'd every Day for &s;ome Months, or ra|ther
&s;ome Years, we might expect another kind of Theory than any we
have hitherto had of the Moon. Now the be&s;t time for making all the&s;e
Ob&s;ervations of the Moon, &s;hould be when it can, with convenience, be
perform'd when the Moon comes ju&s;t to the Meridian; at that time the
Moon being lea&s;t incumbr'd with Refraction and Parallax; and as for the re|ducing
of her Orbit to the Eccliptick, that will be ea&s;ily enough done after|wards,
when her pa&s;&s;age among the fixt Stars is once well known; and, by
the way, methinks it would be the be&s;t way for any &s;uch Ob&s;ervator not to
puzzle or prepo&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf with many Notions, Suppo&s;itions, Theories and
Hypothe&s;es, but rather to lay a&s;ide for a while, at lea&s;t, all tho&s;e Opinions of
determinate Orbs, and Epicycles and Excentricks, and Circles and Elip&s;es,
or any other pre-conceiv'd Notion, and only to make and regulate the Ob|&s;ervations
&s;o (the manner of which I have already &s;hewn) that the true Place
or Po&s;ition of the Moon, among the fixt Stars of the Zodiack, in re&s;pect of
the Center of the Earth; and her true di&s;tance from the Center of the
Earth in that Po&s;ition, might be accurately found out and Regi&s;ter'd; for by
a good number of &s;uch Ob&s;ervations and Collections, we &s;hould not only be
able to examine more narrowly all the already famous Hypothe&s;es, and to
overthrow them perhaps, but to rai&s;e and excogitate divers others, &s;uch as
would at lea&s;t re&s;t upon a more &s;ure Foundation, and if carefully and con&s;i|derately
built be of a more &s;ound and &s;ub&s;tantial Structure.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould the&s;e kinds of Ob&s;ervations be made of the Moon only, but of
the Sun. <HI>Mercury,</HI> &Venus;, &Mars;, &Jupit;, and &Saturn;; for tho' indeed their true di&s;tances
from the Center of the Earth are not &s;o ea&s;ily known (tho' indeed we know
not yet neither to how great a certainty Indu&s;try may bring us even in this
particular al&s;o) tho', I &s;ay, the true di&s;tances of the&s;e Bodies from us be
very difficult to be round, yet their comparative di&s;tances may much more
ea&s;ily; for, by the help of a very good Tele&s;cope, we may at all times ob|&s;erve
their apparent Diameters mo&s;t exactly, and con&s;equently &s;ince, as I
have &s;hew'd the la&s;t Day, the apparent Diameters and Di&s;tances are Reci|procal,
we might have their comparative di&s;tances, and perhaps al&s;o from
comparing &s;everal Circum&s;tances we might come by their true ones al&s;o.
For &s;uppo&s;ing we had the di&s;tance of the Sun and Earth (the mo&s;t likely way
for finding which I &s;hall anon explain) we might po&s;&s;ibly find tho&s;e of the o|ther
Planets by &s;ome &s;uch way as this, namely, by the accurate Ob&s;ervation
of their apparent Diameters with an excellent Tele&s;cope of forty or rather
three&s;core Foot long, when they are neare&s;t approaching their being hid by
the Beams, and when they are in their oppo&s;ition to the Sun; for by the
comparing of the&s;e two we might be inform'd of the proportion between
their di&s;tances at tho&s;e times, and con&s;equently the difference of tho&s;e two,
&s;eeming, for the mo&s;t part, to be a&s;cribable to the great Orb of the Earth.
It will not be difficult, from many of the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, to determine the
proportion of the Diameter of the great Orb of the Earth to the Diameters
of the Orb of <HI>Saturn,</HI> of the Orb of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and of that of <HI>Mars;</HI> the
Diameters al&s;o of <HI>Venus</HI> in her retrograde Conjunction with the Sun, and in
her direct; that is, when &s;he is in her neare&s;t and farthe&s;t di&s;tance from the
Earth, will very much help towards the finding the proportion of the Orb
of <HI>Mercury</HI> about the Sun to that of the Earth.</P>
<P>As for the finding the true di&s;tance of the Sun, the be&s;t way would be by
means of two Ob&s;ervators, plac'd as far a&s;under as they could be conveni|ently;
which two &s;hould either at certain times of the Year (namely, when
the Sun is in or very near either of the Sol&s;tices) ob&s;erve by the help of a
Quadrant (which I &s;hall another time more fully de&s;cribe) by which the Alti|tude
of any Caele&s;tial Body may be ob&s;erv'd to &s;econd Minutes; they &s;hould,
I &s;ay, with &s;uch a Quadrant ob&s;erve mo&s;t exactly the Meridian heights of
the Sun when in the Sol&s;tice, being each of them mo&s;t exactly a&s;&s;ur'd of the
true height of the Pole by ob&s;erving the greate&s;t and lea&s;t height of &s;ome
<PB N="505" REF="484">
notable Star within the Artick Circle by means of this In&s;trument. And
'tis not unlikely but that by this means, the&s;e two Ob&s;ervators, comparing
their Ob&s;ervations, may be able to deduce the Parallax of the Sun. But &s;up|po&s;ing
that be exceeding difficult and &s;carce fea&s;able, yet &s;ome Ecclip&s;e of the
Sun may &s;o fall out as to be di&s;cernable by both; and then from the comparing
of &s;uch Ob&s;ervations made by each, 'twill be no difficult matter, &s;uppo&s;ing
the di&s;tance of the Moon known, to know that of the Sun al&s;o: And ha|ving
its true di&s;tance once given, together with its apparent Diameter at
that time, its di&s;tance at any other time will be ea&s;ily enough found, &s;up|po&s;ing
its Diameter only ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>Having found this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of finding the Earth's Or|bit.</NOTE> it will be ea&s;y, by Ob&s;ervations, to find out the Orbit
of the Sun or Earth, and the Velocity of either of them in any part of it;
and this will be by accurately ob&s;erving and comparing the Appul&s;e of the
Sun and any notable fixt Star, who&s;e Longitude and Latitude is certainly
known to the Meridian; ob&s;erving likewi&s;e the exact Meridian Altitude of
the Sun, together with its apparent Diameter. For performing of the&s;e
Ob&s;ervations as they &s;hould be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Three things nece&s;&s;ary.</NOTE> there will be three things requi&s;ite be&s;ides
what I have already de&s;crib'd, which was the Tele&s;cope; and tho&s;e three
things are, Fir&s;t, An exact Meridian Line or In&s;trument for Azymuths.
Secondly, A mo&s;t exact and manageable Quadrant for ob&s;erving Altitudes.
And, Thirdly, A mo&s;t accurate Time-keeper, Watch, or Clock, each of which
I &s;hall de&s;cribe in their order.</P>
<P>I did, the la&s;t Day, &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of regulating the places of the fixt
Stars before they could be made u&s;e of for finding the true place of any of
the Planets, for I then hinted how much many of them had been found to
deviate from the places a&s;&s;ign'd them by <HI>Ticho.</HI> But becau&s;e it would be very
difficult to rectify all the Con&s;tellations I then hinted; that it would be &s;uf|ficient
for mo&s;t Ob&s;ervations, if only tho&s;e Stars were regulated, which were
the mo&s;t con&s;picuous or notable in or near the Zodiack; and for this pur|po&s;e
I did likewi&s;e then delineate and de&s;cribe a new and mo&s;t exact In&s;tru|ment,
which I judg'd the mo&s;t convenient for that purpo&s;e, of any that has
yet been made u&s;e of, it being an In&s;trument very ea&s;ily manageable, very
little &s;ubject to Error from the make, and if diligence be us'd, &s;uch as will ea&s;ily
enough di&s;tingui&s;h every four Seconds. I did indeavour likewi&s;e to &s;hew the
manner of rectifying it, and u&s;ing it for tho&s;e Ob&s;ervations. And indeed, if only
a Caele&s;tial Globe of all the fixt Stars were to be made, wherein only the Re|&s;pect
and Po&s;ition of the Stars one to another were to be noted, there needed
no other In&s;trument; but becau&s;e their particular Re&s;pects al&s;o, both to the
Poles of the World, and to the Poles of the Eccliptick, that is, to the
Poles of the diurnal and annual motion of the Earth, or rather indeed the
places of tho&s;e Poles among them are to be taken notice of, therefore other
In&s;truments al&s;o will be requi&s;ite Tho&s;e I mention'd the la&s;t Day would be
three, and tho&s;e were, Fir&s;t, An exact Meridian Line. Secondly, A mo&s;t
exact Quadrant for taking Altitudes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">To draw a true Meridian.</NOTE> And, Thirdly, An exact Watch or
Time-keeper. As for a Meridian Line the mo&s;t exact way of obtaining it
(to omit now &s;everal more common which I before hinted) is by ob&s;erving
by the help of certain Perpendiculars, the mo&s;t Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern Excur|&s;ions
of &s;ome Star not far remov'd from the Pole at lea&s;t &s;omewhere plac'd
within the Artick Circle. The manner of doing which may, in &s;hort, be
this, Fix to &s;ome convenient Beam a very long Perpendicular or Plumb-line,
who&s;e &s;u&s;pending String &s;hould be of Bra&s;s-wire of a &s;maller &s;ize, to the end
of which &s;hould be hung a Plummet of Lead, almo&s;t as big as the Wire will
conviniently bear; this Plummet &s;hould be &s;o inclos'd within a Box, that it may
conveniently move, &s;o as to draw the Line Perpendicular, and yet be &s;helter|ed
from the motions and di&s;turbances of the outward Air. To the North
of this, at a good di&s;tance, the farther the better, from a convenient Beam
&s;u&s;pend two other Perpendicular Lines carefully prepar'd and fitted accord|ing
to the directions I gave for the former, and fix them &s;o, that by looking
by the fir&s;t, and one of the&s;e, you may be able to &s;ee the mo&s;t Ea&s;tern Ex|cur&s;ion,
and by the fir&s;t and the other of them, the mo&s;t We&s;tern Excur&s;ion
of the Pole-&s;tar, or any other within the Artick Circle. And having the&s;e
<PB N="506" REF="485">
three Perpendiculars thus exactly regulated, it will not be difficult to &s;u&s;pend
a fourth, &s;o as that by looking by the fir&s;t and fourth, the Angle made by
the &s;econd, fir&s;t and third, may be divided into two equal parts: Between the
tops of the&s;e two Perpendiculars, extend al&s;o another &s;mall Wire which &s;hall
lie mo&s;t exactly in the Meridian Line. And this I judge to be the mo&s;t accur|ate
way of any I have yet met with for finding the Meridian Line, and the mo&s;t
convenient for the u&s;es hereafter to be mention'd. This Line will denote out
the imaginary Circle which pa&s;&s;es through the Pole of the World or of the
diurnal Motion of the Earth, or the Pole of the Horizon or the Zenith of the
place:<NOTE PLACE="marg">To find the Pole.</NOTE> And this being found it will be exceeding ea&s;y to find the exact place
of the Pole in it. Not by the Meridian Altitudes of the Sun; which is to
&s;uppo&s;e that already mo&s;t exactly known, which we &s;hall afterward examine
and find out; but by taking mo&s;t exactly the height of any Star within the
Artick Circle, when by the&s;e Perpendiculars it be found to be in the Meri|dian;
for if by an exact Quadrant its height be ob&s;erv'd when it cro&s;&s;es the
Meridian below and above the Pole; and half the difference of tho&s;e two
heights be added to the lea&s;t elevation or height found, it will give the exact
Point among the fixt Stars, to which the Poles of the Earth do at that time tend:
I &s;ay at that time, becau&s;e it has been found that the Poles of the diurnal Mo|tion
of the Earth do in time change and alter their places among the fixt Stars,
&s;o as to de&s;cribe a kind of Circle about a Point, $in or very near the Poles of
the Eccliptick or Annual motion of the Earth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Earths annual motion and $ol$s of the Eccliptick.</NOTE> I &s;ay, in or very near, be|cau&s;e
it has not been yet certainly determin'd what the variation of the Poles of
the Eccliptick or the annual motion o$ the Earth is; and tho' various A&s;tro|nomers
have excogitated &s;everal Hypothe&s;es, whereby they indeavour to
make the variation of the Obliquity of the Eccliptick regular, and tho' &s;ome
have a&s;crib'd that variation of that Obliquity to proceed from a motion of
the fixt Stars, others from the variation of the very Orb of the Sun or Earth,
others to the variation of the Aequinoctial; yet I cannot find by all the Ob|&s;ervations
that have hitherto been recorded, that the matter can be ac|curately
determin'd; for &s;ince the places of the Stars, &s;et down by the An|tients,
have been found by the noble <HI>Ticho</HI> to be in many particulars very
fal&s;e; and &s;ince that even of tho&s;e exact and diligent Ob&s;ervations of <HI>Ticho,</HI>
there are lately found, by the excellent <HI>Hevelius,</HI> as I hinted the la&s;t Day, &s;o
many of them mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly differing from tho&s;e Places and Po&s;itions they
are plac'd in by <HI>Ticho,</HI> what hope is there of bringing that to any certainty
where the Ground-work or Foundation of Ob&s;ervations on which the Theo|ries
are to be built, are &s;o un&s;table and uncertain? For either there can
be no certain credit given to any Ob&s;ervations to be met with in Authors;
or if there be, I &s;ee, no rea&s;on why we may not affirm even the very ap|parent
di&s;tance of the fixt Stars one from another, or their Po&s;itions or Re|&s;pects
among them&s;elves to be alter'd, and this or that Star to be really in
an other Po&s;ition to the Circumambient fixt Stars; that is, really to appear in
an other place of the Heaven at this Day, than it did in the times of the
Antient A&s;tronomers. Now if this be &s;o, it will be yet a further di&s;pute,
whether this has been caus'd by &s;ome &s;low motions of tho&s;e Stars one among
another; or whether by the alteration of the very Sy&s;teme of the Sun in re|&s;pect
of them; and tho' the fir&s;t &s;eem the more probable, there having of late
Years been ob&s;erv'd very &s;trange variations and alterations as to Magnitude
even among tho&s;e fixt Stars; witne&s;s tho&s;e &s;everal new Stars which have ap|pear'd
and di&s;appear'd, and vary'd their Magnitudes to all degrees almo&s;t
[witne&s;s al&s;o tho&s;e Comets which have been by the late&s;t and be&s;t A&s;trono|mers
judg'd to be above the Orbs of the Planets, and to be equal'd with the
Region of the fixt Stars;] [as to in&s;tance in no other than that new Star
which has &s;o many times appear'd and di&s;appear'd in the Neck of <HI>Caetus</HI> which
was ob&s;erv'd by <HI>Hevelius</HI> in the Year 1660, and does not, that I can find,
appear at this time, no not through a Tele&s;cope.] Tho', I &s;ay, the&s;e parti|culars
might make it mo&s;t probable, that tho&s;e tran&s;po&s;itions have heen made
even in the Regions of Stars; yet 'tis not impo&s;&s;ible but that &s;ome variati|ons
even in the Sy&s;teme of the Sun, may make &s;ome &s;en&s;ible difference. And
this, by the way, minds me of a thing which I have &s;everal Years &s;ince pro|pounded
<PB N="507" REF="486">
as a thing worthy examination and experiment, and that is to be,
by fixing a long and good Tele&s;cope directly again&s;t that Star of the Dragon,
which is little more than three Degrees di&s;tant from the Pole of the Ecclip|tick,
when in the Meridian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To examine that motion.</NOTE> and to ob&s;erve whether by that means there
cannot be found a manife&s;t difference between the Elevation or Altitude of
it at two di&s;tant times of the Year; that is, &s;uppo&s;ing tho&s;e two Ob&s;erva|tions
to be made at half a Years di&s;tance; for to me it &s;eems not unlikely
but that the annual Orb of the Earth (if &s;uch a motion it have) may, by this
means, be perceiv'd to de&s;cribe a &s;mall Circle about the Pole of the Ecclip|tick.</P>
<P>For &s;ince by a thirty &s;ix Foot Tele&s;cope it is exceeding ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h
the Seconds of a Degree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This was wrote before the Au|thors $ttempt for the Earth's motion.</NOTE> nay, almo&s;t Thirds, 'tis $ot improbable but that
the annual Orb of the Earth may de&s;cribe a Circle about the Pole of the
Eccliptick, who&s;e apparent Diameter may at lea&s;t amount to &s;ome Seconds if
not Minutes. And there &s;eems not any more likely way in the World of
determining the Truth or Fal&s;ity of the Copernican Sy&s;teme than by this
means. Now, tho' the&s;e Stars which lie neare&s;t the Pole of the Eccliptick, if
other particulars be an&s;werable, were the be&s;t for this kind of Ob&s;ervation,
yet the Ob&s;ervation of the Pole-&s;tar may perhaps be &s;ufficient; for if the
difference of the Meridian Altitudes of tho&s;e Stars that are near the Poles
of the Eccliptick be con&s;iderable, tho&s;e Stars al&s;o which are very near the
Poles of the World, cannot chu&s;e but have a &s;en&s;ible variation; and con&s;e|quently
al&s;o the Pole of the diurnal motion of the Earth will de&s;cribe a &s;mall
Ellip&s;e near the Pole-&s;tar, which 'tis not unlikely but &s;ome &s;uch way as this
may, by &s;everal Circum&s;tances, detect. But to return to what I was &s;aying a|bout
the manner of examining the places of the fixt Stars. I &s;ay, it were
extreamly de&s;irable that a Caele&s;tial Globe were &s;o made, that the exact Place
and Po&s;itions of all the Stars, in re&s;pect of one another, were mo&s;t acturate|ly
determin'd and delineated, without any regard at all to the Eccliptick or
Aequator; that is, that the di&s;tances of the Stars from one another might,
by accurate Ob&s;ervations to be made with the double Tele&s;cope, be defin'd,
after which, from a &s;ufficient number of accurate Ob&s;ervations to be made,
as I &s;hall by and by direct, the true Eccliptick or way of the Sun or Earth a|mong
the&s;e Stars &s;hould be exactly found out and delineated: For it is
&s;ufficiently evident from the various Theories and Hypothe&s;es, and Tables of
A&s;tronomers, and by the variations of them all from Ob&s;ervations, how much
they are all of them hitherto to &s;eek in many particulars, not only in a
great mea&s;ure of the true Motion or Velocity of the Sun or Earth in the
Eccliptick Line, but &s;omewhat al&s;o of the very Po&s;ition of the Eccliptick-line
it&s;elf, and con&s;equently all the Aequations of times which are deduc'd
from the&s;e, are &s;omewhat uncertain al&s;o. Now for finding out the Ec|cliptick,
the be&s;t way would be, Fir&s;t, To find out the true Point or Pole of
the World, which may with care be mo&s;t accurately done. Next the Aequa|tor
or Aequinoctial Circle &s;hould be found, and for the Time and Year when
the Ob&s;ervations are to be made, the Declination and right A&s;cen&s;ion of &s;ome
of the mo&s;t notable Stars near the Aequator; that is, taking for the time the
Longitude and Latitude of the Stars to be reckon'd after the &s;ame manner
as the Longitude and Latitude of places on the Earth are, namely, by tak|ing
a Meridian or great Circle pa&s;&s;ing through the Pole of the World, and
any notable fixt Star, and for the pre&s;ent placing that as the fir&s;t Meridian,
as 'twere; then taking notice of the right a&s;cen&s;ion of the mo&s;t notable Stars
in re&s;pect of that Point where that great Circle cuts the Aequator, making
&s;ome allowance in all the following Ob&s;ervation for the proce&s;&s;ion of the
Aequinoxes, according as I &s;hall by and by direct; and in&s;tead of the true
Latitude of the Stars from the Eccliptick, which we will &s;uppo&s;e yet to be
&s;ought, at lea&s;t which we de&s;ign hereby to examine, to take their Declina|tion
<HI>pro tempore,</HI> from the Aequinoctial Circle. But becau&s;e neither the&s;e nor
the following Ob&s;ervations can be well made without the two other In&s;tru|ments

<P>Prepare a Quadrant of Bra&s;s or Wood, or any other convenient Sub&s;tance,
that will neither warp nor &s;hrink, &s;uch as ABC in the Figure, who&s;e Radius
PB may be about &s;ixteen or eighteen Inches long, more or le&s;s; let, to one
&s;ide of it, be fa&s;tned a long, &s;quare, hollow piece, as AD, of the &s;ame &s;ub|&s;tance,
and about a Foot longer than the Radius of the Quadrant having a
perforation through the whole length of it, of about an Inch over, to &s;erve
for the Tube of a three Foot Tele&s;cope on the out &s;ide of the piece; &s;u&s;pen|ded
a Perpendicular or Plumb-line FE, who&s;e Plummet F may be large and
heavy; then prepare a &s;mall long Index, &s;haped in the manner of that in
the Figure IHG, which &s;hould be of &s;ome matter that is exceeding light and
&s;tiff, &s;uch as the out&s;ide of a Cane, or the like; and &s;o order'd, that the
&s;hort end GH may counterpoi&s;e the longer HJ; which longer HJ &s;hould be
taper'd into a very &s;mall and &s;lender Stern, and point towards I: Into the part
H of this &s;hould be let in a &s;mall piece of Bra&s;s k, into which &s;hould be
drill'd an exceeding &s;mall and fine Hole or Center, the &s;maller the better, &s;o
that it will indure the fine&s;t Steel Wire tho' as &s;mall as the Hair of a Man's
Head to pa&s;s through it, and no more; for the more curious and exact this
contrivance be made, by &s;o much the more exact will the In&s;trument it&s;elf
prove: At the bigger end of this &s;lender Index G, fix a &s;mall piece of Bra&s;s
which may &s;tand above the Plain about a quarter of an Inch, as X, and in
the mid&s;t of it cut a very &s;mall &s;lit only ju&s;t big enough for the Plumb-line
FE, to &s;lide or be thru&s;t between it. Having thus prepar'd this Index, by
means of a &s;mall Steel Wire coming out of a hole in the middle Line of the
Tube AD, at a convenient place of it, put on this Index, &s;o that the &s;mall
top of it, I, may reach and point to the &s;mall cro&s;s at F; the other end of
this Wire pa&s;&s;es through the hole of a &s;mall bended Arm of Bra&s;s NH, and
is there fa&s;tned. Having thus fitted on this Index and hung on the Plumb-line
EF, making it pa&s;s through the &s;mall &s;lit of the Bra&s;s X, that is erected
upon the bigger end of the Index GHI, &s;et the piece AD Perpendicular,
which you will be able to do to the greate&s;t exactne&s;s imaginable; for by
means of this &s;mall Index, if the piece AD be never &s;o little out of its Per|pendicularity,
the top of the Index I, will make it mo&s;t vi&s;ible; &s;o that by
this means you may come to as great an exactne&s;s as if the piece AD, and the
Plumb-line, were above &s;ixty Foot long; for the end of the Index HI being
near thirty Inches, and the Plumb-line being &s;omewhat longer, and the &s;hor|ter
end of this Index being but one Inch, or the thirtieth part of the length,
it will follow, that what&s;oever motion is impre&s;s'd on the &s;horter end of the
Index G, will be thirty times more &s;en&s;ible at the &s;maller end of the Index F,
and con&s;equently that the &s;ame exactne&s;s of Perpendicularity will be found,
as if the length of the Perpendicular or Plumb-line were thirty times in|creas'd
or lengthen'd, which would amount to more than three&s;core Foot.
But thus far I have only explicated the way of &s;etting the Quadrant mo&s;t ex|actly
Perpendicular. The next thing I am to &s;hew is, how it will be able to
determine Altitudes, not only to Minutes, but even to Seconds. The con|trivance
for performing which effect, for mea&s;uring, is this, Let the edge
of the Quadrant BC be made of Bra&s;s, tho' the re&s;t of the Quadrant be o$
Wood; let this edge be an Inch thick at lea&s;t, and rounded mo&s;t exactly
and truly to the Center P; upon which Center P, make a Ruler PR to move,
and on this fix a &s;mall Tele&s;cope MO of the &s;ame length with AD, namely,
about three Foot long, having a very good Object-gla&s;s at M, and a very
deep Eye-gla&s;s at O, and by this Gla&s;s the Po&s;ition of an Object may more
nicely be di&s;tingui&s;h'd than it can be by any common &s;ights, tho' they be plac'd
more than &s;ixty Foot a&s;under: And for the exact determination of the An|gle
that this vi&s;ual Ray makes with the Perpendicular I, cau&s;e to be plac'd
upon this Tube and Ruler a flat Circular Plate VXY, of about two Foot
Diameter, the Limb of which I divide into three equal Parts, and each of
<PB N="509" REF="488">
tho&s;e I &s;ubdivide again into &s;ixty Parts, and each of tho&s;e &s;ixty I again &s;ub|divide
into &s;ixty more; &s;o that the whole Circumference, which will be
about &s;ix Foot and a quarter, will be divided into ten Thou&s;and eight Hun|dred
parts; for thrice &s;ixty will be one Hundred and Eighty, and &s;ixty
times one Hundred and Eighty will make one Thou&s;and eight Hundred;
which number of divi&s;ions it will ea&s;ily enough bear, by means of Diagonals.
This Circle is &s;o fixt on the Ruler, that the Center of it Q may be di&s;tant
from the edge or limb of the Quadrant BC, exactly one One Hundred and
twentieth part of that Diameter; then prepare a &s;mall Cylinder of Bra&s;s,
who&s;e Diameter may be exactly the &s;ixtieth part of the Radius PB, and
who&s;e length may be equal to the thickne&s;s of the edge or reim of the Qua|drant;
let this, by means of two &s;mall Centers or Pins, be mov'd in the
hole, on the end of which Axis is put a &s;mall light Index ST; the&s;e things
being &s;o prepar'd, by means of a &s;mall String which is &s;tretch'd on the broad
edge of the Quadrant BC, and at the &s;ame time rould about and fix'd to
the Cylinder Q; this Cylinder Q is &s;o held by it, that, by the moving
the Ruler PR three Degrees on the edge of the Quadrant, the &s;mall Cy|linder
Q makes a perfect Revolution, and con&s;equently al&s;o the Index ST
will make a compleat Revolution al&s;o: So that the Hand making a Revo|lution
every three Degrees, and every of tho&s;e three Degrees having a &s;pace
o$ length of above twenty five Inches, it will not be difficult, as I &s;hew'd
$$$ore, to divide each of tho&s;e Spaces into &s;ixty Minutes, and each of tho&s;e
&s;$xt$ Minutes into &s;ixty Seconds. And this is that In&s;trument, which, if
$word$ Care and Art be us'd in the making of it, and in the manner of ob|$$$ing
will be found as exact as a Quadrant of thirty or forty times that
$$dius, if not more, and for its lightne&s;s and &s;mallne&s;s will be ea&s;ily ma|nageable
and portable. I &s;hall not now &s;tay to &s;hew the manner of rectifying
and u&s;ing it, but &s;hall refer it to &s;ome other opportunity.</P>

<P><HI>JVne</HI> 25. 1685. I have, in my former Lectures, explain'd tho&s;e imaginary
Lines upon the Surface of the Earth, which are of u&s;e in Navigation,
and are found by the help of Caele&s;tial Ob&s;ervations, <HI>viz.</HI> Fir&s;t, Meridians,
being great Circles which pa&s;s through the two Poles of the Earth. And,
Secondly, Parallels; namely, le&s;&s;er Circles which are parallel to the Aequa|tor,
that great Circle which divides the Surface of the Earth into the No|thern
and Southern Hemi&s;pheres: And have &s;hewn you, that all indea|vours
in the Art of Navigation, is to be able to find out the proper Circle
of both kinds, which is peculiar to the place of the Ship. How the Paral|el
Circle is found I have al&s;o &s;hew'd, <HI>viz.</HI> how the Latitude of a place, or the
di&s;tance of it from the Aequinoctial Line, is to be found by Caele&s;tial Ob|&s;ervations,
either of the Sun in the Day time, or of the fix'd Stars in the
Night; the methods of which are very ea&s;y, and commonly known
and practis'd, tho' not without con&s;iderable defects both in the In&s;truments
and the $$mmon practi&s;e of Ob&s;ervation, as I &s;hall explain more at large
when I treat concerning the Nautical In&s;truments, and their u&s;e at Sea.</P>
<P>I have likewi&s;e explain'd the ways of finding the Po&s;ition of the Meridian,
or the North and South Line of a place, by the help of Caele&s;tial Ob&s;erva|tions,
and of the Magnetical Needle, and at the &s;ame time of finding how
much that Magnetical Needle or Compa&s;s doth vary there-from either to|wards
the Ea&s;t, or towards the We&s;t. But this is only the finding of the
Meridian con&s;ider'd as an Azymuth Circle, and not the finding of the Me|ridian
peculiar to the place in re&s;pect of any other Meridian which pa&s;&s;eth
through &s;ome other place; which is that which is requir'd to the determina|tion
of the Po&s;ition of a place upon the Surface of the Earth in re&s;pect of
the Parallel and Meridian, which is the main end of Geography and Navi|gation.</P>
<P>The finding then of the Meridian of a place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the Lon|gitude is.</NOTE> which I here intend, is the find|ing
which of all the infinite Meridian Circles which pa&s;s through the two Poles
and cut the Aequinoctial at right Angles, is the Meridian that pa&s;&s;es through
the place where, or for which the inquiry is made; that is, what Angle that
Meridian maketh at the Pole with any other known or determin'd Meridian
that pa&s;&s;es through any other known and a&s;&s;ign'd place, or what part or
parts of the Aequinoctial Circle are intercepted between the two Points
where the &s;aid Meridians cut the &s;aid Circle. This is that Ploblem which
<PB N="511" REF="490">
is call'd the finding of the Longitude of a Place, and which hath for &s;o long
a time puzzl'd all the Geographers, A&s;tronomers, and Geometricians to find
out a demon&s;trative and practical way to re&s;olve; and which, nothwith|&s;tanding
the multitude of ingenious attempts that have been made for that
purpo&s;e, doth hitherto remain an un&s;olvable Problem, e&s;pecially at all times
and at Sea, where the mo&s;t $$e of it would be. Not but that much hath been
done towards it, by various inventions, which, tho' not compleat and per|fect
in their kind, are yet of very great u&s;e in Geography and Navigation,
as I &s;hall by and by &s;hew. But the perfecting of this Art is, yet as a thing want|ing
in the World, and very much &s;ought for. And this the more, becau&s;e
Geography and Navigation are lame without it, having but one of its two
Leggs good and &s;ound, the other being but a Stilt or Prop; however it
hath hitherto &s;erv'd to carry on the practice of Navigation, by which the
greate&s;t part of the World hath been not only di&s;cover'd but Traded to, and
by means hereof every one part almo&s;t of the Earth, e&s;pecially of Maritine
Parts hath Communication with every other. It will therefore de&s;erve to
be inquir'd into and de&s;crib'd as to that &s;tate of Perfection and Practice
which it hath now attain'd; that from the knowledge from what &s;tate it is
in at pre&s;ent, we may be the better able to di&s;cover its Defects, and what
it further wants to make it compleat and perfect.</P>
<P>The helps then that have been propounded or made u&s;e of hitherto for
finding the difference of Longitude between two places, or the Angle that
their re&s;pective Meridians make at the Pole, may be reduc'd to the&s;e &s;even
general Heads.</P>

for &s;ome known Meridian, to which &s;uch Ob&s;ervations may be referr'd,

pre&s;ently deduc'd. Now, tho' no A&s;tronomical Tables have been &s;o perfect
and compleat as to perform what is nece&s;&s;ary, yet they have notwith&s;tanding
been founded upon a true Ground and Principle, and have failed only upon
the account of the Imperfection of the Theories yet known o$ Caele&s;tial mo|tions,
a help for which I intend &s;hortly to publi&s;h.</P>

The fir&s;t way is by the Ecclip&s;es of the Moon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Six of them.</NOTE> ob&s;erv'd either at &s;everal

<P>The &s;econd way is by ob&s;erving the place of the Moon cro&s;&s;ing or reduc'd
to the Eccliptick.</P>
<P>The third way is by ob&s;erving the true place of the Moon in any part of
her Orb or Dragon, which is various ways perform'd, either by taking her
di&s;tance from one or more fix'd Stars, or from Altitudes taken in known Azy|muths.</P>
<P>The fourth way is by ob&s;erving, with a good Tele&s;cope, the progre&s;s of
the Light and Darkne&s;s over the &s;pots and marks in the Face of the Moon.
The&s;e four la&s;t ways &s;uppo&s;e a perfect Theory, and Tables of the Lunar mo|tions,
both which are yet wanting.</P>
<P>The fifth way is by the Satellites of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> or by the fix'd &s;pot in one of
the Belts of <HI>Jupiter;</HI> and this either ob&s;erv'd at divers places, or at one only.
This la&s;t &s;uppo&s;eth a perfect Theory and Tables of the motion of <HI>Jupiter</HI>'s
Satellites, which are yet wanted.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth is by the Satellites of <HI>Saturn.</HI> The&s;e two la&s;t ways are to be ob|&s;erv'd
by the help of long Tele&s;copes, without which, the motions and ap|pearances
requi&s;ite for this purpo&s;e, cannot be ob&s;erv'd; and therefore 'till
better Tele&s;copes be found than tho&s;e we have at pre&s;ent (&s;uch as, tho' of
but a &s;hort and manageable length, as of three or four Foot, will yet make
the appearances as plain as one of tho&s;e we now u&s;e of thirty or thirty &s;ix
Foot long) the&s;e ways will be of little or no u&s;e upon the Sea, tho' they may
be of very con&s;iderable u&s;e upon the Land in tho&s;e Towns or parts where the
Ship has occa&s;ion to &s;tay. Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e they happen very often in compari|&s;on
of Lunar Ecclip&s;es: And, Secondly, Becau&s;e by Ob&s;ervations of the&s;e
kinds made on the Land at &s;uch places, compar'd with Ob&s;ervations made at
any other known place, the difference of Longtitude between tho&s;e places
will be rectify'd, and con&s;equently they will much help to the rectifying
Mapps or Chards, which is one very nece&s;&s;ary In&s;trument to be made u&s;e
of in Navigation.</P>
<P>Now for the better under&s;tanding of all the&s;e A&s;tronomical wa$s of $$|quiring
the Longitude of a place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some things p$e$ni&s;ed.</NOTE> It is nece&s;&s;ary to pr$mi&s;e &s;ome praecog$$
which are nece&s;&s;ary to be known, in order to a better comprehen&s;ion of the$$</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erv'd then, that every place upon the Surface of the Eart$
hath a Caele&s;tial as well as a Terre&s;trial Meridian, that is, the $maginary
plain of the Meridian of each place &s;uppos'd extended to the Orb of the
fix'd Stars, doth de&s;ign an imaginary Line among them; which, as the ima|ginary
Meridians upon the Earth are &s;uppos'd to pas through the <HI>Arctick</HI> and
<HI>Autarctick</HI> Poles or Points upon the Surface of the Earth, &s;o the imaginary
Meridians an&s;wering to them in the Heavens, arc &s;uppos'd to pa&s;s through
the two Poles of the Aequinoctial in the Heavens, upon which is made the
diurnal motions of the Heavens in the Ptolomaick Hypothe&s;is. When there|fore
the Sun is &s;een in any place to be in the Meridian of that place it is
twelve of the Clock at that place, but at no other place what&s;oever but
&s;uch as lie under the &s;ame Meridian, for to all other places it is either before
or after Noon. So that as many Degrees as a place lies Ea&s;tward of the
place in which the Sun is at that pre&s;ent in the Meridian, by &s;o many De|grees
doth the Sun there appear to have pa&s;t it, and by how many it lies
more We&s;t, by &s;o many doth the Sun want of coming to its Meridian; and
becau&s;e the Sun pa&s;&s;eth three hundred and &s;ixty Degrees in twenty four
Hours, and con&s;equently fifteen Degrees in an Hour, and fifteen Minutes in
a Minute, and fifteen Seconds in a Second of Time, therefore it is ea&s;y to
reduce the Degrees and Minutes of the difference of Longitude to Hours
and Minutes of Time, and contrary wi&s;e, to reduce Hours, Minutes and
Seconds of Time to Degrees, Minutes and Seconds of Longitude.</P>
<P>This being premis'd, I come next to the Explication of the A&s;tronomical
methods</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fir&s;t me|thod by Ec|clip&s;es of the Moon.</NOTE> and principal, which hath been often practic'd, and
which hath been of very good u&s;e for di&s;covering the Longitude of Places,
is that by an Ecclip&s;e of the Moon, ob&s;erv'd fir&s;t in differing places at the
<PB N="513" REF="492">
&s;ame moments of univer&s;al time, but at different Local times: This Eclip&s;e of
the Moon being an accidental darkning of the whole or &s;ome part of the
Moon's Face, by rea&s;on of the Moon's pa&s;&s;age through &s;ome part of the
conical &s;hadow of the Body of the Earth, becomes vi&s;ible to more than a
Hemi&s;phere of the Surface of the Earth. So that if the &s;ame were ob&s;erv'd
accurately in as many places as it could be &s;een at, this alone would &s;hew
the true Longitude of all tho&s;e places in re&s;pect of one another, and would be
a means to rectify the Mapps for all &s;uch parts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Local time what.</NOTE> By Local time, I mean that
denomination of one and the &s;ame in&s;tant of univer&s;al time which it receives
in &s;everal places, from the re&s;pect that the Caele&s;tial Bodies have at that in|&s;ant
to the Horizons and Meridians of tho&s;e &s;everal places; becau&s;e the
&s;ame in&s;tant that is call'd twelve a Clock in one place where the Sun appears
in the Meridian, is in other places call'd, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, a
Clock, and all other denominations of Minutes, Seconds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that can be in
the twenty four Hours of the Day. Now the beginning and end of an E|clip&s;e
of the Moon being made in le&s;s than a Minute of time (for it is ea&s;y,
by the naked Eye, to di&s;cover, within le&s;s than a Minute, when the real
&s;hadow ju&s;t touches the Limb of the Moon, and by the Tele&s;copes to di&s;co|ver
to le&s;s than a quarter of a Minute) if tho&s;e times be diligently ob&s;erv'd
in &s;everal places, and adju&s;ted exactly to the Local times of tho&s;e places,
the different Local times being compar'd will give the different Longitude of
tho&s;e places in re&s;pect of one another; for every Hours difference of time
gives fifteen Degrees difference, and every minute of time gives fifteen mi|nutes
of a Degree of Longitude: And by &s;o much the &s;ooner or earlier in
the Local time of the Natural Day or each place it appears, by &s;o much the
more We&s;twardly is the place &s;ituated; and by &s;o much the later the &s;ame
appearances are &s;een in each place, by &s;o much the more Ea&s;twardly is the
&s;ituation of that place. 'Tis true, that in &s;uch places where the Eclip&s;e
appeareth near the Horizon, re&s;pect ought to be had of the Refraction and
Parallax of the Moon, in giving the vi&s;ible Po&s;ition of the Moon in re&s;pect
of the fix'd Stars that may pa&s;s under or very near to it, when &s;o Eclip&s;ed;
but if we only regard the Local time, that may be exactly found by the fix'd
Stars, either by taking their Altitudes or ob&s;erving their Tran&s;its by the
Meridian, without having any regard at all to either of them.</P>
<P>The whole uncertainty that happens to Ob&s;ervations of this kind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difficulty in ob&s;erving Eclip&s;es of the Moon and how to obviate it.</NOTE> is only
from the difficulty of di&s;covering the very moments of the beginning and
end of the Ecclip&s;e, becau&s;e of a certain penumbra or le&s;&s;er &s;hadow which
incompa&s;&s;eth this Conical &s;hadow of the Earth; in&s;omuch, that I have of|ten
ob&s;erv'd this Penumbra to dusk that Limb of the Moon which is next
the Cone for near half an Hour before the real &s;hadow toucheth it, and for
as long after the real &s;hadow is gone off from it, after the end of an Eclip&s;e.
But generally the Umbra is &s;o much differing from the Penumbra, that
one may, with ea&s;e, be certain; to le&s;s than a minute of time, when it
toucheth the Limb, e&s;pecially in Immer&s;ions and Emer&s;ions out of the total
darkne&s;s in total Eclip&s;es. Tho&s;e that have the convenience of Tele&s;copes
may have the particular intermediate times when the Umbra doth cover or
pa&s;s through the middle of &s;ome remarkable &s;pots in the Face of the Moon
as the &s;hadow comes on or goes off; becau&s;e the Limb of the Umbra is much
more defin'd upon the Face of the Moon, when both the light and the dark
parts can be &s;een together; and 'twill not be difficult this way to be certain
to le&s;s than fifteen Seconds of Time, and con&s;equently to be &s;ure of the dif|ference
of Meridians to le$s than four minutes of a Degree: which is as near
to exactne&s;s as need be, for mo&s;t Geographical or Nautical U&s;es. For the u&s;e|fulne&s;s
and practicablene&s;s of this way I could produce you multitudes of in|&s;tances
of the Rectification of the Longitudes of places from one another, and
con&s;equently of the true ground of making or rectifying of Mapps; but I
&s;hall only in&s;tance in one or two: The fir&s;t &s;hall be that which was made
by Captain <HI>Thomas James</HI> at <HI>Charlton</HI> in <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Bay, October</HI> the 29th 1631,
and by Mr. <HI>Henry Gellibrand</HI> profe&s;&s;or of A&s;tronomy in this Hou&s;e, where
he, with &s;everal other Friends, made the Ob&s;ervation of the &s;ame Eclip&s;es.
Now, after the return of the &s;aid Captain <HI>James,</HI> Mr. <HI>Gellibrand</HI> comparing
<PB N="514" REF="493">
the two Ob&s;ervations together, found that the Meridian of <HI>Charlton</HI> was
We&s;tward of the Meridian of <HI>London</HI> five hours eighteen minutes in Time;
or in Degrees of Latitude, 79&deg;. 30'. This he verify'd al&s;o by another method,
of which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak hereafter, and found the difference of
Meridians of tho&s;e two places to be in time 5h. 14m. or in Degrees of Lon|gitude
78&deg;. 30'. which differs from the former account but four minutes of
Time, or one Degree of Longitude. Now what difference did thus ari&s;e be|tween
the account of the former, and the latter way is certainly to be a&s;cri|b'd to
the latter method, which was more complicated and depended upon
the truth of Tables, there being no Ob&s;ervation made here at this place to
corre&s;pond with Captain <HI>James</HI>'s made at <HI>Charlton:</HI> However, Mr. <HI>Gelli|brand</HI>
in his appology thinks it may be the better born withal, &s;ince it could
come &s;o near the truth in the finding the difference of Longitude of Places
&s;o far remov'd; &s;ince very famous Authors, who have &s;ought the Longitude
of Places by other methods, have differ'd from one another, and from the
truth &s;o much more; for giving an in&s;tance of the &s;ituation of two eminent
Cities here in <HI>Europe,</HI> not very far from one another, and which have each
of them had very eminent Mathematicians and A&s;tronomers, <HI>viz. Rome</HI> and
<HI>Norimberg: Regiomontanus</HI> makes their difference of Longitude $6; <HI>Werner
32; Appian 34; Me&s;tline</HI> and <HI>Origanus 33; Stof$er 18; Maginus 26; Schonerus
12; Mercator</HI> and <HI>Handiuso 12. Stadius 13; Jan&s;$nius 10; Longomontanus 16;
Lausbergius 10;</HI> but <HI>Kepler</HI> by two Ob&s;ervations of two Lunar Ecclip&s;es, made
according to this method, de&s;troys them all, and proves them to be different
but only four minutes of Time.</P>
<P>So that we may plainly perceive that this method, if it be duly ob&s;erv'd,
and the Ob&s;ervations accurately and judiciou$ly made, is much to be prefer|r'd
before divers others. And therefore I do very much wonder why the
Learn'd Dr. <HI>Vo&s;&s;ius.</HI> in his late Treati&s;e, that he hath publi&s;h'd concerning the
rectification of the Longitudes of places, &s;hould reject this way as fallacious
and uncertain, whereas tis mo&s;t undeniably certain that 'tis infinitely to be
preferr'd before the other ways which he there mentions: And indeed con|&s;idering
the facility and obviou&s;ne&s;s of it to any ones under&s;tanding, and
thence the practicablene&s;s of it by any of the mo&s;t ordinary Capacity, and
with the lea&s;t apparatus of In&s;truments, and without a &s;uppo&s;ition of the
perfection of A&s;tronomical Tables; I think I may pronounce it the mo&s;t
generally practicable way yet known; not but that &s;everal of the other A|&s;tronomical
ways which I am to explain, will, with great Care and Circum|&s;pection,
and convenient In&s;truments, together with intelligent A&s;tronomers
to perform the Ob&s;ervations and Calculation, bring us to a much grea|ter
preci&s;ene&s;s. But &s;ince tho&s;e Requisites are not at all times and places to
be procur'd, there is more of real good to be expected from this one me|thod,
than from any other yet known; and to hint that only by the bye,
I find that this Ob&s;ervation of Captain <HI>James</HI> and Mr. <HI>Gellibrand</HI> doth prove,
that the mo&s;t part of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mapps have made that place in <HI>Hud&s;ons-Bay</HI>
above ten Degrees of Longitude too much to the We&s;tward.</P>
<P>There are other in&s;tances of this Nature might be produc'd to &s;hew that
&s;everal parts of the Ea&s;t Indies are, in the Mapps, plac'd too far to the Ea&s;t|ward,
contrary to the &s;upp&s;ition of Dr.<HI>Vo&s;&s;ius</HI> in his $word$ Treati&s;e. But I &s;hall
not now insi&s;t upon further proof of that which will be &s;o ea&s;ily under&s;tood
by any one, who &s;hall well con&s;ider o$ its Principles.</P>
<P>Next to this way $word$ &s;hall annex that of ob&s;erving the <HI>Satellites</HI> of <HI>Jupiter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The &s;ecnd me|thod by the</HI> Satellites of Jupiter.</NOTE> be|cau&s;e
they are of the &s;ame Nature, and proceed upon the &s;ame Grounds.
And &s;uppo&s;ing the u&s;e of Tele&s;copes to be practicable at Sea, would be
there of very great u&s;e, which I do not de&s;pare to &s;ee effected in a &s;hort time:
But for determining the $ongitudes of places upon the Land, Ob&s;ervations
may be made twenty times more exact, if a convenient apparatus of In&s;tru|ments
be procur'd, and diligent and knowing ob&s;ervers be made u&s;e of, and
this by rea&s;on of the almo&s;t momentary continuance of the appearance, that
is to be ob&s;erv'd, which will thence be &s;een by all the ob&s;ervers at the &s;ame
in&s;tant almo&s;t of time; whereas there is a greater Latitude of uncertainty in
Eclip&s;es of the Moon by rea&s;onn of the Penumbra.</P>
<P><PB N="515" REF="494">
This way then by the <HI>Satellites</HI> of <HI>Jupiter</HI> to knowing and diligent A&s;trono|nomers
is much to be preferr'd before that of <HI>Eclip&s;es of the Moon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This way pre|ferrable.</NOTE> upon

of a large Tele&s;cope; nay, within half that di&s;tance if the Po&s;ition of the
Ecliptick do favour the appearance either in the Morning before the Sun
Ri&s;ing, or in the Evening after the Sun Set: But the <HI>Satellites</HI> are mo&s;t con|&s;picuous,
when <HI>Jupiter</HI> is more than a Quadrant from the Sun. Now, that
this may be the better under&s;tood, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to explain, in &s;hort,
the <HI>Mundus Jovialis:</HI> We are to know then, that <HI>Jupiter</HI> being the highe&s;t Pla|net
but one, namely, <HI>Saturn,</HI> being view'd through a Tele&s;cope, is di&s;cover'd
to have around Body in Diameter, when acronical about 50'.. This Body
is ob&s;erv'd to have &s;everal darker or dusky Belts which cro&s;s the Face of it
parallel to the Eccliptick, and by a con&s;picuous &s;pot, which I fir&s;t di&s;co|ver'd,
this Body is found to move round upon its Axis in about ten Hours
time; be&s;ides this, <HI>Galileo</HI> fir&s;t di&s;cover'd that it had four &s;maller Planets,
which he call'd <HI>Satellites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Satellites <HI>fir&s;t ob&s;erv'd by</HI> Galileo.</NOTE> which continually mov'd round about it; the&s;e,
by later Ob&s;ervations, compar'd with former, have been reduc'd to &s;uch a
Perfection, as that by Tables, made of their periodick Revolutions, the Po|&s;itions
and Affections of them, for any certain time, can be pretty near a&s;|certain'd..
The fir&s;t and innermo&s;t of the&s;e is di&s;tant about three Semidia|meters,
and performs its Revolution in about 42&frac12; Hours: The &s;econd is di|&s;tant
about five Semidiameters, and performs its Revolution in eighty five
hours and twenty minutes: The third is di&s;tant about 8 &frac12; Semidiameters,
and performs its Revolution in about one hundred &s;eventy two Hours. The
fourth and outermo&s;t is di&s;tant about fourteen Semidiameters, and performs
its Revolution in near &s;ixteen Days, eighteen Hours and a Quarter; or 402&frac14;.
Hours.</P>
<P>THo' the di&s;tances and Revolutions of the&s;e &s;ecundary Planets differ very con|&s;iderably
from what the Learned Dr. <HI>Gregory</HI> in his late accurate <HI>A&s;trono|miae,
Phy&s;icae &amp; Geometricae, Elementa,</HI> yet I have not pre&s;umed to alter
them, but have Printed them as the Author has left them: They are placed by
Dr.<HI>Gregory</HI> as follows. The innermo&s;t <HI>Satellite</HI> of <HI>Jupiter</HI> makes its Revolution
in one Day &frac34; and is di&s;tant 5 &frac23; Semidiameters from the Center of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> The
&s;econd &s;urrounds him in 3 &frac35; Days, and is di&s;tant nine Semidiameters, The third
in the &s;pace of 7 &frac16; Days, who&s;e di&s;tance is 14 &frac13; Semidiameters. The fourth and la&s;t
in 16 &frac34; Days,, and is di&s;tant 25 &frac13; Semidiameters. The di&s;tances are almo&s;t double,
whence the mi&s;take of our Author proceeded, I know not, but I thought be&s;t to give
the intelligent this &s;hort Adverti&s;ement of it.</P>

<P>Every one of the&s;e four in every Revolution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Satellites</HI> may &s;erve for finding the Longitude in &s;ix Po&s;itions.</NOTE> have at lea&s;t two remarkable
Po&s;itions fit for this purpo&s;e; &s;ome have four, &s;ome may make &s;ix remark|able
Signals. The Signals fit for this purpo&s;e, are, Fir&s;t, Their touching
the Limb of the Body of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> either at their ingre&s;s or egre&s;s, and that
is al&s;o in every Revolution double: Fir&s;t, When they are in their &s;uperior
half of their Epicycle, and &s;o move direct, they have their Ingre&s;s and E|gre&s;s
behind the Body of <HI>Jupiter.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="516" REF="495">
Secondly, When they are in the lower half of their Epicycle and appear
Retrograde, they have their Ingre&s;s likewi&s;e, and their Egre&s;s from the Face
of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> Next when the outermo&s;t of them does not touch, but either
move above to the Northwards, or below to the Southwards, their Orbit
or Epicycle then appearing an Ellip&s;is, then there are at lea&s;t two remarkable
Po&s;itions of them which will be fit for this purpo&s;e; that is, their direct Con|junction
and their Retrograde Conjunction. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are two &s;orts
of Eclip&s;es; the fir&s;t &s;ort are tho&s;e of the <HI>Satellites,</HI> that is, when the <HI>Satillites</HI>
enter into the dark Cone of the &s;hadow of the Body of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> or when they
emerge or get out of it, both which may be &s;ometimes plainly di&s;cover'd in
the &s;ame Revolution of the <HI>Satellite,</HI> at other times only one of them, that is,
either the Immer&s;ion or Emer&s;ion.</P>
<P>Secondly, There is an Eclip&s;e al&s;o caus'd upon the Body of <HI>Jupiter</HI> by the
&s;hadow of the <HI>Satellite,</HI> by which means one may, with a good Gla&s;s, plainly
perceive a dark &s;pot or &s;hadow entring the Ea&s;t Limb of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing
over &s;ome part of its Face, to leave the Body of <HI>Jupiter</HI> at its We&s;t Limb:
Each of the&s;e Tran&s;its of the &s;hadow will afford three remarkable In&s;tants or
Times fit for this purpo&s;e, namely, Fir&s;t, The Ingre&s;s of the Shadow or
Spot into the Face. Secondly, Its Po&s;ition in the middle of the Line of its
Tran&s;it, which by region of either of the Belts upon the Face of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> or
the lateral Po&s;ition of &s;ome of the other <HI>Satellites,</HI> may be ea&s;ily di&s;cover'd.
And, Thirdly, The In&s;tant when it goes off or leaves the Limb of <HI>Jupiter,</HI>
which are plainly enough di&s;cover'd by good Tele&s;copes and diligent Ob&s;er|vers.
So that &s;ince there are &s;o many remarkable Accidents ob&s;ervable, &s;carce
any Night can pa&s;s without affording &s;ome one or more of tho&s;e opportu|nities.
Hence it will be &s;ufficiently evident, that there will be above a
hundred convenient times to make &s;uch Ob&s;ervations more than can po&s;&s;ibly
happen by means of Ecclip&s;es of the Moon.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are other remarkable Conjunctions of the <HI>Satellites</HI>
them&s;elves one with another, which will &s;erve for proper Remarks, e&s;peci|ally
at &s;uch times as <HI>Jupiter</HI> is in or very near the Eccliptick; for then the
plains of the Orbs of the <HI>Satellites</HI> are very near in the plain of the Ecliptick,
and the apparent motion of the <HI>Satellites</HI> is very near in a &s;traight Line, and
&s;o the Conjunction of one of them Retrograde in the lower part of its Epicy|cle
with another of them direct in the upper part of its Epicycle, is very
&s;hort and momentary, and &s;o becomes a fit mark for &s;uch an Ob&s;ervation.
The like may al&s;o be ob&s;erv'd when <HI>Jupiter</HI> having a con&s;iderable Latitude the
way of the <HI>Satellites</HI> appears Elliptical; for then the Conjuction of two <HI>Satelli|tes,</HI>
may, with &s;ufficient accuratene&s;s, be ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>Now any one of the&s;e remarkable appearances being view'd and exactly
ob&s;erv'd by two Per&s;ons at differing places, if the times of &s;uch appearances
be exactly taken at both places, they will certainly give the difference of the
Longitude of tho&s;e two places in the &s;ame manner, as I before &s;hew'd, might
be done by Eclip&s;es of the Moon; and con&s;equently if the &s;ame appearance
were ob&s;erv'd with the &s;ame care in a hundred places, the Longitudes of all
tho&s;e places would be thereby a&s;certain'd, and that in the next place to a
much greater preci&s;ene&s;s than 'tis po&s;&s;ible to do by the help of Eclip&s;es of
the Moon; becau&s;e &s;ome of the&s;e may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd almo&s;t as ea&s;ily to a
Second of Time, as tho&s;e of the Moon may be to a Minute, which ap|pears
yet farther, Fir&s;t, By rea&s;on of the &s;mallne&s;s of the Body of the <HI>Sa|tellites.</HI>
Secondly, By rea&s;on of the great Velocity of all and much more of
the innermo&s;t or fir&s;t, which is next the Body of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> Thirdly, By rea|&s;on
of the &s;mall di&s;tances of them, and e&s;pecially of the two innermo&s;t from
the $ody of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and con&s;equently of the &s;mall Penumbra the &s;hadow of
the $ody there affords, which is al&s;o &s;o much the more di&s;tingui&s;h'd by rea&s;on
of the va&s;t di&s;tance of the Sun, and thence of the great Dimination of its
Diameter, when view'd from the Body of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and thence the &s;mallne&s;s
of the Angle of the Penumbra; for whereas the Angle of the Penumbra at
the Earth is about half a Degree, the Angle of the Penumbra at <HI>Jupiter</HI> will
not be more than 1/9 part of a Degree, the di&s;tance of the Earth from the Sun
to that of <HI>Jupiter</HI> being but as 10 to 45, or as 2 to 9. All which Particulars
<PB N="517" REF="496">
do contribute to the quickne&s;s and &s;hort duration of the appearance: So
that the Time is very preci&s;e and &s;een by a whole Hemi&s;phere of the Earth,
as it were, in a moment; and there is no regard to be had of Parallax, and
nothing el&s;e to be taken notice of but the very preci&s;e time of the appear|ance;
for this only gives the true difference of Longitude between all tho&s;e
places where it &s;hall be &s;o ob&s;erv'd by the &s;ame method, as I mention'd be|fore
in Eclip&s;es of the Moon.</P>
<P>The Difficulties that occur in this method,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difficulties in this method.</NOTE> are, Fir&s;t, That pretty long
Tele&s;copes are requi&s;ite for making the Ob&s;ervations and accurate Pendulum
Clocks, both which are as yet not practicable at Sea. But, as I &s;aid before,
notwith&s;tanding this it may be made u&s;eful in Harbours and on Shore in &s;uch
places where Ships may re&s;ide, which will be of great u&s;e for rectifying the
Longitudes of Charts and Mapps.</P>
<P>A &s;econd Difficulty in this way, is the di&s;tingui&s;hing of one of the <HI>Satellites</HI>
from the other: But for this the Theory of them is &s;o far brought to per|fection,
and was above twenty five Years &s;ince much advanc'd by my Prede|ce&s;&s;or
the ingenious Mr. <HI>Laurence Rook,</HI> that the Po&s;itions and appearances of
the <HI>Satellites</HI> can be certainly Predicted and Calculated for any certain time;
and 'tis not difficult to make an Automaton or piece of Watch-work which
&s;hall, at all times, give the Po&s;itions and appearances accurate enough for
&s;uch Ob&s;ervations, at lea&s;t to direct an Ob&s;erver at what time he is to expect
or watch for &s;uch an Appearance; and I have verify'd very many of Mr.
<HI>Rook</HI>'s Predictions and Ephemerides for tho&s;e Appearances, and found them
pretty exact, even to le&s;s than a minute of Time. By which method if Ephe|merides
be made for one, two, three or more Years, and &s;ent abroad into
the Ea&s;t and We&s;t <HI>Indies,</HI> and other parts of the World, 'tis not unlikely
but many &s;uch Ob&s;ervations might be procur'd from &s;everal parts of the
World, which would be of great u&s;e, e&s;pecially if at the &s;ame time there
were &s;ome in <HI>England</HI> that &s;hould con&s;tantly make the like Ob&s;ervations here
with equal care. And I have good rea&s;on to hope, that by this means we
may obtain the Longitudes of &s;everal places in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> &s;ince I un|der&s;tand
that the <HI>French</HI> King hath &s;ent &s;everal very able A&s;tronomers into
the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> with an apparatus of &s;it In&s;truments, almo&s;t on purpo&s;e to
make the&s;e and &s;uch other curious and u&s;eful Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this I am certainly informed, that it hath been of late much practi|&s;ed
in <HI>France,</HI> whereby they have fix'd the Longitudes of the principal Towns
in <HI>France,</HI> and al&s;o that of <HI>Vraniburge</HI> in <HI>Denmark,</HI> and of <HI>Cayen</HI> in <HI>Iceland,</HI>
in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>French</HI> upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guiana</HI> in <HI>America.</HI> But
this only by the bye&punc;</P>
<P>But $word$ to proceed, the &s;ame thing may be done by the <HI>Satellites</HI> of <HI>Saturn;</HI>
but they being di&s;cover'd but of late, and &s;o not yet brought to &s;o perfect
a Theory, and be&s;ides requiring much longer and better Tele&s;copes to ob&s;erve
the Appearances; I &s;hall forbear to di&s;cour&s;e farther of them 'till tho&s;e <HI>De&s;i|derata</HI>
are procur'd; but whatever Invention will &s;erve to detect their Ap|pearances,
will be much more u&s;eful for ob&s;erving the &s;ame of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which
are much more near, and &s;o much more vivid and con&s;picious.</P>
<P>The &s;ame thing may be done by ob&s;erving the Appul&s;es of the Moon to
any fix'd Star that lies in its way, when ob&s;erv'd at &s;everal places of the
Earth, wherein the Appearance is &s;o very &s;hort and preci&s;e, that even in the
&s;pace of a &s;ingle Second of Time, a Star is &s;een and quite di&s;appears behind
the Body of the Moon; but then by rea&s;on that both Refraction and Parallax
are to be accounted for, which are differing to every place where the Ob&s;er|vation
&s;hall be made, it is not fit for common u&s;e, but requires &s;ome better
skill in A&s;tronomy than mo&s;t Ob&s;ervers are furni&s;h'd with, which I &s;hall there|fore
pretermit for the pre&s;ent, becau&s;e I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to treat more
largely of it when I explain tho&s;e ways that do nece&s;&s;arily require a know|ledge
of both tho&s;e.</P>
<P>But &s;till all the&s;e methods are u&s;ele&s;s as to the main de&s;ign for which the
knowledge of the Longitude is de&s;ir'd; which is from Ob&s;ervations made
upon the place wherever it be, whether at Sea or on Land, and to deter|mine
pre&s;ently what is the Longitude of that place from any known Meridi|an.
<PB N="518" REF="497">
This is that Invention which has hitherto puzzl'd all the Learned Men,
whether Mechanicks, Navigators, Geographers, A&s;tronomers, Geometers
and Philo&s;ophers; among which, tho' there have been many pretenders, yet
no one has perform'd it, or &s;hewn the way how to do it: 'Tis true, there
have been enough have &s;hewn what things are requi&s;ite to do it, but no one
has produc'd tho&s;e Requi&s;ites. 'Tis certain, that an exact Theory and Tables
of the motion of the Moon, or of the motion of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and his <HI>Satellites</HI>
would perform it; but tho&s;e Theories and tho&s;e Tables are hitherto want|ing,
as are al&s;o exact Clocks that will move exactly upon the Sea, and &s;uch
Tele&s;copes as tho' but of three Foot length, and &s;o might be made u&s;e of
at Sea, would yet do as much as tho&s;e we now have of thirty Foot; 'till which
be procur'd, the&s;e ways, that I have hitherto nam'd, will be of little u&s;e for
this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> 12. 1685. I explain'd to you the la&s;t Term, &s;everal praecognita
nece&s;&s;ary ro be known, in order to the finding the Longitude of any place
upon the globous Body of the Earth; that is, of finding the Angle that the
Meridian of that place maketh with any other determinate Meridian, whe|ther
it be the prime Meridian generally agreed upon, or any other particular
Meridian of &s;ome notable place from which the Ship departs; who&s;e re|&s;pect
to the prime Meridian, or the Meridians in the Chart made u&s;e of, is
known. In order to which I enumerated the &s;everal general ways that have
been hitherto thought of for effecting this end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;everal ways for find|ing the Longi|tude.</NOTE> namely, A&s;tronomical, Ho|dometrical,
Magnetical, Chronometrical, Mechanical, Phy&s;ical, and Mixt.
Each of the&s;e ways I did more fully explain the la&s;t Term, and &s;hew'd the
&s;everal bounds of them, as al&s;o the &s;everal Objections, Difficulties and Im|perfections
each of them was &s;ubject to, and what they wanted to make them
compleat and u&s;eful; which I &s;hall not now trouble you with the repetition
thereof, but rather proceed to the &s;econd method or general way of finding
the Longitude of places, or difference of Meridians. Namely, The</P>
<P>Hodometrical,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hodome|trical way.</NOTE> or by the ob&s;ervation or computation of the way of the
Ship between place and place; that is, of ob&s;erving the &s;everal Rumbs or
Lines in which the Ship &s;aileth, and what way it hath made in every of tho&s;e
Rumbs; that is, how many Leagues or parts of a League the Ship hath
pa&s;s'd in every Rumb it hath &s;ail'd upon, and how to compute the &s;ame, and
thence to deduce the true place of the Ship at any time, in re&s;pect of the
place from whence the departure is made, or the difference of the Meridi|ans
of the Ship, and that place, which is the Longitude de&s;ir'd. In order to
the better explication of which it will be nece&s;&s;ary to explain the &s;everal
parts that are nece&s;&s;ary Ingredients in every &s;uch Inquiry or Operation, that
&s;o it may be perform'd the more knowingly and &s;cientifically, and not by
wrote and ignorantly as it is now perform'd, for the mo&s;t part, by practical
Navigators;<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the Rumb or Line of a Ships way is.</NOTE> and to that end it will be nece&s;&s;ary to explain, Fir&s;t, What
kind of Line it is a Ship de&s;cribcs upon the Surface of the Earth or Sea in its
pa&s;&s;ing or &s;ayling through it, when &s;teer'd upon a certain Point of the
Compa&s;s. Secondly, How that Line is found and di&s;tingui&s;h'd from all other
Lines that may be de&s;crib'd upon the Surface of the Earth, for that it is a Line
not only differing from all other Lines upon the Surface, but becau&s;e every
one of tho&s;e Lines differ from every other of the &s;ame kind; and not only
&s;o, but every part of each Line differs from every other part thereof in many
re&s;pects;<NOTE PLACE="marg">How it differs from all other Lines.</NOTE> as Fir&s;t, In its flexure or bending: Secondly, In re&s;pect of its pro|portion
to the Meridians and Parallels, namely, as to the men&s;uration of
Latitude and Longitude: And, Thirdly, In re&s;pect of any other great or
le&s;&s;er Circles that may be drawn, or &s;uppos'd drawn upon the Surface of the
Earth; &s;uch as le&s;&s;er Circles of di&s;tance from any one Point or Place; or
greater Circles, &s;uch as Lines of Po&s;ition or great Azymuthal Circles. Nor
have I hitherto met with any Globe whereon the &s;aid Lines have been truly
de&s;crib'd, or any other that has pre&s;crib'd a Scientifical or practical way of de|&s;cribing
the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The chief propriety then of this <HI>Rumb-line,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">T$e chief Pro|priety of the Ru$b $$$e.</NOTE> upon the Surface of the Globe,
is, that it always makes the &s;ame Angle with all the Meridional Lines or Cir|cles
that it cuts or cro&s;&s;eth, and con&s;equently that it is a <HI>Spherical-Spiral</HI> or
<PB N="519" REF="498">
<HI>Helix</HI> which incompa&s;&s;eth the &s;ame with infinite Revolutions which will ne|ver
bring it to the two Polar Points which are the Centers, towards which it
tends both towards the North and towards the South; notwith&s;tanding the
infinite Revolutions, yet it is a finite Line which beareth a certain proportion
to the length of a Meridian, and may be defin'd, determin'd and divided as
exactly as any other Line or Circle drawn upon the Face of the Globe, and
al&s;o the re&s;pect or proportion that any part of the whole Line beareth to
the Meridian or Parallel that it cro&s;&s;eth.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, As to the length of any Rumb-line; I &s;ay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of its length and proportion to a great Cir|cle.</NOTE> that it beareth the &s;ame
proportion to the length of a great Circle, that the Secant of that Rumb
Angle from the North or South, hath to the Diameter of the Globe; &s;o
that tho' it maketh Infinite Revolutions about each Polar Point, and will
never arrive at it, yet are all the&s;e infinite Revolutions equal to a finite and
determinable length of a &s;traight Line, and that to as great an exactne&s;s as
the proportion is or can be determin'd between the Radius or Diameter of a
Circle and the Circumference thereof. Both which Proprieties, and &s;everal
other tending to the men&s;uration and computation of the parts thereof, and
for manife&s;ting the re&s;pect they bear to the Meridians or Parallels, or for de|termining
of the re&s;pective Variation of the Longitude and Latitude which
it maketh in its Progre&s;s either way towards the North or South Poles, I
&s;hall, in &s;ome following Lectures, demon&s;trate; whereby all &s;uch Di&s;putes, as
have ari&s;en about that Subject, will be remov'd, and the Nature and Pro|prieties
thereof will be manife&s;ted by a much ea&s;ier method of Demon&s;tra|tion
than what hath been hitherto by any one us'd or produc'd for that pur|po&s;e.
I &s;hall al&s;o &s;hew &s;ome other &s;orts of Projections of the Sphaere in <HI>Plano,</HI>
than have hitherto been produc'd, very apt and pertinent for this purpo&s;e,
whereby the Navigator may more ea&s;ily, with his Ruler and Compa&s;&s;es,
mea&s;ure the Rumb-line, and re&s;olve all Que&s;tions that concern the &s;ailing
by the &s;aid Line with as great certainty and exactne&s;s as is nece&s;&s;ary to work
withal from any Ob&s;ervations or Men&s;urations that can be made at Sea by
the Logline and Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>But before I can well proceed with the explication of this Head, it will
be nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e &s;ome Praecognita of practical Geometry, which will
be u&s;eful for the knowledge and more ea&s;y de&s;cription of the Rumb-lines,
and for the mea&s;uring of the parts of them; e&s;pecially by rea&s;on that the
Rumb-line as it is, or ought to be, de&s;crib'd upon the Globe, as it is very
difficult and almo&s;t impracticable to be made u&s;e of at Sea; &s;o do I not find
that the &s;aid Lines are hitherto truly laid down upon any Globes yet extant,
or any certain way pre&s;crib'd for the true drawing or laying down of the
&s;ame upon the Surface thereof, but they are &s;et off by &s;ome Points from Tables
calculated for that purpo&s;e, and the interjacent parts of the Lines are fitted
up by hand and by gue&s;s, which is very imperfect and inartificial.</P>
<P>But by an In&s;trument that I ha$e invented, it may be mo&s;t exactly drawn,
not only upon the Surface of the Globe it&s;elf, but al&s;o upon &s;everal pro|jections
of the Globe in <HI>Plano</HI> or upon a Plain, whereby not only the &s;everal
Proprieties of the &s;aid Line may be expre&s;s'd, but al&s;o the men&s;uration of it
by the help of Ruler and Compa&s;s, will be more facile, expedite and tract|able
for u&s;e, and the true Na$$ of this perplex'd Line more ea&s;ily compre|hended
and conceiv'd: And this I do the rather, becau&s;e I judge, that by
means of this way the true Cour&s;e of the Ship may be more &s;peedily, ea&s;ily,

Sailing one Watch, then all nicety beyond that is lo&s;s of Labour and Time.</P>
<P>By Practical Geometry then I under&s;tand that part of Geometry, which
teaches an ea&s;y way of performing that by Operation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is here meant by practi+cal Geometry.</NOTE> which is requir'd to
be done by Theory, in order to put it into effect and practi&s;e. The bu&s;ine&s;s
then of this Practical Geometry, is principally to de&s;cribe, de&s;ign and lay
down all tho&s;e Things or Lines exactly, according to the Theory which are
requir'd to be done, and to determine and mea&s;ure the quantities of the parts
de&s;ir'd by, or from that De&s;cription.</P>
<P><PB N="520" REF="499">
I know that into Practical Geometry, is u&s;ually al&s;o taken all the Bu&s;ine&s;s of
Ob&s;ervation, &s;uch as the taking or mea&s;uring of Angles, of Altitudes of the
Caele&s;tial Bodies or Terre&s;trial, as Mountains, Clouds, and the like, and
the mea&s;uring of Sides or Angles upon the Earth in &s;urveying; and the mea|&s;uring
of the Contents of &s;olid Bodies, as Timber, Stones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the
mea&s;uring of Liquors, or the capacity of containing Ve&s;&s;els, as is done in
Gauging, and other practical parts of Mathematicks; but the&s;e as not at all
pertinent to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, I &s;hall now omit, and only confine my &s;elf
to &s;peak of &s;o much of Practical Geometry as &s;erves to teach the true de|&s;cribing
and dividing of &s;uch Lines, Surfaces or Bodies as are, or may be
u&s;eful for this part of Mathematicks upon which I am di&s;cour&s;ing, which is
of the Art of Navigation; namely, how any Probleme that is requir'd, or is
nece&s;&s;ary for this Art, may, by the help of Ruler and Compa&s;&s;es, be truly
protracted and mea&s;ur'd upon a Plain, with as great exactne&s;s as 'tis po&s;&s;ible,
by the help of the In&s;truments and Methods that are hitherto us'd to make
Ob&s;ervation on which to ground the Calculation.</P>
<P>In this then I have four things to be con&s;ider'd, which makes up the Pytha|gorick
Tetractys, namely, Point, Line, Superficies and Solid; of each of
which I &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>By Point then I do not here under&s;tand an imaginary nothing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is here meant by a Point.</NOTE> which, in
&s;peculative Geometry, is defin'd to be a Negation of Quantity, or an Entity
that hath no Part or Quantity; but I under&s;tand &s;uch a Point as hath
Quantity and Extention, but yet &s;o &s;mall and minute, as that the &s;en&s;e can|not
di&s;tingui&s;h that it hath any Parts; &s;uch as the Point of a very &s;harp Needle,
or the Point of a very curious pair of Compa&s;&s;es; or &s;uch a mark with Ink
as is made with a very &s;harp nibb'd Pen upon fine &s;mooth Paper, which tho'
it may be ea&s;ily enough prov'd, either by Micro&s;copes and other Gla&s;&s;es and
by Rea&s;ons too to have breadth, and &s;o both Longitude and Latitude, nay,
and Profundity too or thickne&s;s, yet as to the u&s;e, for which it is here de|&s;ign'd,
it is &s;ufficient, and may pa&s;s for a true Mathematical Point, if at
lea&s;t we will but &s;uppo&s;e the middle of it to be that which is aimed at in
our Operation.</P>
<P>A Point is determin'd or given or found when the re&s;pects it hath to &s;ome
other Point or Points, Line or Lines that are al&s;o given and known, and are
&s;ufficient to determine its true place., as if it be de&s;ir'd to find or place a
Point upon a plain Superficies that &s;hall have the &s;ame di&s;tance from each of the
two other Points given that they have one from another: The Proprieties
can but agree with two Points in all that Plain, which two Points are one on
the one &s;ide, and the other on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of a Line drawn between the
two fir&s;t Points given, and therefore the place of the Point is not determin'd
unle&s;s the &s;aid re&s;pect be al&s;o given.</P>
<P>But if a Circular Line be given, and it be de&s;ir'd to find or make a Point
which &s;hall be equally di&s;tant from every part of that round Line, then is the
Po&s;ition of that Point truely defin'd, and can be plac'd but in one place to
have that Re&s;pect or Propriety.</P>
<P>But further, if two Points be given in a Plain, and it be requir'd to find
or place another Point in that Plain that &s;hall have this Propriety, that the
&s;traight Lines drawn from the third Point to be found, &s;hall make a right
Angle, or any other Angle at that third Point, then are the Data not &s;uffi|cient
to determine the Point, becau&s;e there may be infinite of &s;uch Points
found, which will all fall in &s;ome part of a Circle which pa&s;&s;es through tho&s;e
two fir&s;t Points; and to determine &s;uch Point it will be nece&s;&s;ary either to
give the determinate di&s;tancc from one of tho&s;e two fir&s;t Points, or the An|gle
that is made at one of them. Again, if from two &s;uch Points it be re|quir'd
to find or place a third Point, who&s;e di&s;tances from the fir&s;t two &s;hall
be to each other of any known or determin'd Proportion, as 2, to 3, or the
like; the Data are not &s;ufficient to determine the third Point, becau&s;e there
may be infinite of &s;uch Points, all which will fall either in a Circle or a
&s;traight Line; and therefore there is &s;ome other Propriety requi&s;ite to de|termine
the third Point to a certain Po&s;ition. In the like manner I could in|&s;tance
a hundred other Ca&s;es, to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity there is of giving Pro|prieties
<PB N="521" REF="500">
&s;ufficient to determine the Po&s;ition of any Point which is to be plac'd,
otherwi&s;e the Practi&s;e or performance thereof cannot be done. But I &s;hall
not here further in&s;i&s;t upon it, becau&s;e that I &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e of it more fully in
the con&s;ideration of Lines, Superficies and Solids; and the only thing to be
ob&s;erv'd in the placing of a Point, is to &s;et it exactly in the cro&s;&s;ing of two
Lines which are to determine its Po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The next we are to con&s;ider is Lines; that is, not a length without bredth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Lines.</NOTE>
as in pure and &s;peculative Geometry, but a length that hath the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible
bredth that can be de&s;crib'd, &s;uch as a Line drawn with the point of a very
&s;harp Needle, or point of a Compa&s;s, or fine nibb'd Pen, which may pa&s;s for
a length without bredth at lea&s;t, if we con&s;ider the middle of it.</P>
<P>Now Lines may be either &s;traight or bent; a &s;traight Line is that which
is the &s;horte&s;t that can be drawn between two Points given, and con&s;equent|ly
there can be but one &s;uch drawn, and therefore that Line is perfectly gi|ven,
which is &s;o determin'd by two given Points, and therefore in &s;peculative
Geometry, 'tis put for a <HI>Po&s;tulatum,</HI> that &s;uch a Line may be &s;uppos'd drawn,
or is ea&s;y to be drawn; but in practical Geometry we mu&s;t con&s;ider of the
means how to draw it actually, which in &s;ome ca&s;es is not &s;o ea&s;ily perform'd,
if extraordinary truth and exactne&s;s be requir'd: For,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difficulty of drawing a &s;trait Line.</NOTE> Fir&s;t, if the Line be
to be drawn upon a plain, a &s;traight Ruler being laid &s;o as that the &s;traight
edge of it ju&s;t pa&s;&s;es over the two Points, then moving along by that edge a
fine pointed Needle or &s;harp nibb'd Pen, we draw a line from the one Point to
the other, and for common u&s;e the thing is done; but if any thing of Nicene&s;s
or Curio&s;ity be requir'd, we &s;hall find it very difficult to lay the Ruler &s;o as that
it equally re&s;pects the two Points, but that it will lie a little nearer one Point
than the other. Again, 'tis difficult to carry the Needle or Pen along with
the Hand, as always to keep the &s;ame re&s;pect to the &s;ide of the Ruler. And,
Thirdly, 'Twill be very difficult to find or provide a Ruler that is perfectly
&s;traight, but that it will have &s;ome bending in it one way or other, be it
&s;hot never &s;o true with a Plain; for tho' the Plain be true that &s;hooteth it,
yet if the Ruler be not &s;ecur'd from warping it will bend under the Plain;
be&s;ides, there are very few Plains that are &s;o true, but that, if they are of
Wood, will, in a &s;hort time, have &s;ome little warping or bending; and I know
an ingenious Workman that a&s;&s;ur'd me he could never &s;hoot any thing true
'till he had made a Plain of Steel, which he had ground down to a truth of
&s;moothne&s;s and plaine&s;s by rubbing and poli&s;hing it upon another Plain, and
to have a true Plain to rub it upon, it is no ea&s;y matter to procure as I have
been &s;ufficiently &s;atisfy'd by &s;uch as have indeavour'd to have them for grind|ing
of Optick or Per&s;pective Gla&s;&s;es; for I could never yet meet with any one
but that, by a way I had to examine them, I have found them either a little
Concave, or a little Convex, tho' that were &s;o little, as not, by the common
ways of examination, to be ea&s;ily found. But it may be &s;aid, that &s;treign|ing
a fine Wire, or Hair, or fine Silken Clew between two Points, will de|&s;cribe
or draw a &s;traight Line between two Points; to which I an&s;wer, that
if the Plain on which &s;uch a Line be to be drawn be exactly plain, and that
plain lie exactly Horizontal, then &s;uch a Wire or Hair will perform it; but
if the Plain be inclin'd or &s;tand Perpendicular, and the two Points are not
Perpendicular one over the other, then &s;uch a Line can never be &s;treign'd
&s;trait whatever &s;trength it be &s;treign'd withal; for its own weight &s;hall
make it bend down in the middle, as has been &s;ufficiently demon&s;trated by
the ingenious <HI>Galileo,</HI> and <HI>Mer&s;ennus,</HI> and divers others; e&s;pecially if there
be any con&s;iderable di&s;tance between the two Points. The&s;e things I mention
to &s;hew, that tho' it be taken for granted, that this which &s;eems the ea&s;i|e&s;t
of all things in practical Geometry to be done, yet is not performable
without great difficulties where nicene&s;s and great exactne&s;s is requir'd:
And po&s;&s;ibly this might be the rea&s;on why Geometricians will not allow &s;uch
Lines to be Geometrical, who&s;e way of de&s;cribing requires the &s;liding of a point
along by the &s;traight &s;ide of &s;uch a Ruler as the Ellip&s;e, and &s;everal other
Curve Lines, who&s;e Proprieties are as exactly known and calculable as that
of the Circle, and this only granted may be as ea&s;ily de&s;crib'd, and therefore
may as rea&s;onably be &s;uppos'd de&s;cribable as the Circle or a &s;traight Line.
<PB N="522" REF="501">
Since from what I have alledg'd 'tis evident, that it cannot be done exactly
without con&s;iderable difficulties; but if the two Points be very far di&s;tant,
it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible by any way to exhibit or draw &s;uch a Line; for not a|gain,
to mention the bending of Rulers or Line, which 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to pre|vent,
even the &s;ight it&s;elf, that is the Ray of Light, pa&s;&s;ing from Point to
Point through the Air, is not a &s;trait Line as to its Po&s;ition, by rea&s;on of the
differing Refraction which is in the <HI>Medium</HI> of the Air, which I my &s;elf have
very often prov'd by Ob&s;ervation, finding the &s;ame three Points which ap|pear
at one time in a &s;traight Line, at another time, &s;ometime within half
an hour, have appear'd out of it very con&s;iderably, which I have very often
diligently remark'd.</P>
<P>I have been the more large and particular in &s;hewing you the difficulties
that occur in the actual or practical performance of that which &s;eemeth, and
is &s;o &s;uppos'd, the ea&s;ie&s;t &s;ort of Line that can be drawn, that you may not
think it &s;trange if hereafter when I &s;hew you the way of drawing Rhomb|lines
of &s;everal, &s;orts, and &s;ome other Curve-lines u&s;eful in Navigation, you
meet with &s;ome kind of Difficulties and Ob&s;tructions in the methods and
ways of de&s;cribing and mea&s;uring of them, which yet I &s;hall &s;hew you as to the
true u&s;e that is to be made of them in Navigation, will be as &s;ufficient as the
Circle or &s;traight Line; but upon this I &s;hall not now further in&s;i&s;t, but pro|ceed
In the next place to &s;hew how on a given Line about a Point given, a
Circle may be de&s;crib'd; this, in Speculative Geometry, is a <HI>Po&s;tulatum</HI> and
&s;uppos'd as ea&s;y and obvious to be done, and in &s;mall Circles on a Plain or
Table,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difficulty of drawing Arches of great Circles.</NOTE> it is &s;o by opening the Compa&s;&s;es to the length of the Line having &s;et
one Point of the Compa&s;&s;es in the Point given, and with the other &s;triking
round the Circumference 'till it return to the place where it began, by which
means a Circular Line may be de&s;crib'd much ea&s;ier and more exact than a
&s;traight, Line, or any other can be drawn. But for the de&s;cribing greater
Circles the thing to be done is not &s;o ea&s;y, nay, &s;o difficult, that 'tis almo&s;t
impo&s;&s;ible, e&s;pecially where exactne&s;s is requir'd, as I was &s;ufficiently &s;a|ti&s;fy'd
by the difficulties that occurr'd in &s;triking a part of the Arch of a Cir|cle
of &s;ixty Foot Radius for the gage of a Tool for grinding Tele&s;cope Gla&s;|&s;es
of that length; whereby it was found that a Beam Compa&s;s made with all
Care and Circum&s;pection imaginable, and us'd with as great Care, would not
perform the Operation nor the way by an Angular Compa&s;s, &s;uch as is de|&s;crib'd
by <HI>Guido Vbaldus</HI> in his de&s;cription of the Plani&s;phere, and al&s;o by
<HI>Blagrave</HI> in his Mathematical Jewel, and &s;everal other Authors, there being
found &s;o great a difficulty in making the edges of Rulers exactly &s;mooth and
&s;traight, as I did formerly mention, there being indeed no other practical
way of making &s;uch edges but the gaging of three &s;uch edges all true to
one another by rubbing and grinding, as there is hardly any other practi|cal,
way of making the edge of a Ruler to be a part of a very large Arch
&s;it to be a gage for a Tool for grinding Tele&s;cope Gla&s;&s;es, then by grinding
and rubbing the edges of two &s;uch Rules together, the one whereof is Con|vex
and the other Concave. The difficulties in this kind I do the more in&s;i&s;t
upon here, becau&s;e of the u&s;e of &s;uch parts of large Arches in the drawing
of the Projections of the Sphere, which the Work-men u&s;ually perform by
the help of a Steel Bow, which is bent le&s;s or more, as is de&s;ir'd, by means
of a Screw again&s;t the middle of it, the two ends of the &s;aid Bow being held by
the frame of the In&s;trument in which the Screw is al&s;o mov'd. But this In|&s;trument
as it is much more ea&s;y and applicable to this purpo&s;e, &s;o is it far
le&s;s true and exact than the Angular In&s;truments. The true Figure of &s;uch a
Steel Lath for bending Circularly being not yet known, which I affirm not|with&s;tanding
what <HI>Marchetty</HI> in his Treati&s;e <HI>de Re&s;i&s;tentia Solidorum,</HI> has de|mon&s;trated
&s;eemingly to the contrary; and if it were, and were exactly
made, yet tho&s;e that have been conver&s;ant or experience'd in the Nature and
U&s;e of Steel for Springs or bending, will quickly be &s;atisfy'd how difficult a
matter it is to procure &s;uch a uniform peice of Steel, and how much harder
it is to temper it equally But I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t further on this Matter at
pre&s;ent, having only mention'd what I have here alledg'd, to &s;hew, that
tho' th$&s;e two Lines which are the &s;imple&s;t and mo&s;t ea&s;y to be drawn and
<PB N="523" REF="502">
de&s;crib'd are yet not of &s;o ea&s;y performance in &s;ome Ca&s;es where great ex|actne&s;s
is requi&s;ite, but that there is great care nece&s;&s;ary in the preparing and
u&s;ing In&s;truments fit for that purpo&s;e; and likewi&s;e to &s;hew that if the &s;ame
care be taken in the providing and u&s;ing of In&s;truments for de&s;cribing the
Rhomb-lines, they may al&s;o be de&s;crib'd and drawn with the like certainty
and exactne&s;s, and be every way as fit for u&s;e and practi&s;e in bu&s;ine&s;s of Na|vigation.</P>
<P><HI>Nov.</HI> 19. 1685. I begun the la&s;t day to explain &s;ome part of Practical
Geometry, in order to reduce Mathematical Theories about Navigation in|to
U&s;e and Practi&s;e, and explain'd the ways and the difficulties al&s;o of draw|ing
the &s;imple&s;t and plaine&s;t of all Lines, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;traight and the Circular
Lines whith are taken for granted in Speculative Geometry to be &s;o ea&s;y to
be done, which notwith&s;tanding, when there is requir'd great exactne&s;s in the
performance, are not &s;o ea&s;y actually to be effected.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why &s;pecula|tive Geometry puts &s;ome things as Po|&s;tulata that cannot be per|formed.</NOTE>
It may therefore be in|quir'd,
why then are they put as <HI>Po&s;tulata</HI> as if performable by any? To which
I an&s;wer, That the bu&s;ine&s;s of Speculative Geometry being only to demon|&s;trate
the propriety of &s;uch quantities, as Lines, Superficies and Solids from
their Definitions or De&s;criptions; it is &s;ufficient to have only a right Con|ception
of what is to be under&s;tood by tho&s;e Appellations, and that they are
things po&s;&s;ible to be done, or conceiv'd &s;o to be, for grounding the Demon|&s;trations
thereupon, and that the actual drawing and delineating of them there,
is only to help the Imagination to conceive the notion of them aright. But
when we con&s;ider them in reference to Practical Geometry, we are to con|&s;ider,
not only that the things to be done are po&s;&s;ible, but to teach the
Ways, In&s;truments and Operations how they may be actually perform'd,
and therefore 'tis not here enough to conceive, that there may be a right
Line drawn between two Points, or there may be a Circle de&s;crib'd about a
Point or Center at a di&s;tance given or determin'd, and then to demon&s;trate
by rea&s;on that tho&s;e Lines mu&s;t have &s;uch and &s;uch Proprieties; but we are
to draw them actually, and to &s;hew by practi&s;e and actually doing, the thing
requir'd, and thereby to exhibit the thing done to Sen&s;e, which is one of the
ends and u&s;es of Speculation. But it may be Objected by &s;ome, or at lea&s;t
thought &s;o; but what need is there of all this Curio&s;ity, Preci&s;ene&s;s and
Care of placing Points aright, and drawing Lines &s;o curiou&s;ly &s;traight, and
of Circles &s;o exactly round and true? To which I an&s;wer, that this is not
a needle&s;s Curio&s;ity, nor &s;o &s;light and in&s;ignificant a Matter as not to be re|garded,
but a matter of great U&s;e, nay, a thing of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity; and
without which, all the real u&s;e of Practical Geometry, e&s;pecially in Geogra|phy,
Navigation and A&s;tronomy, will be lame and imperfect: for all our
deductions and conclu&s;ions in the&s;e Arts are founded upon proper and true
Ob&s;ervations made; and all our Ob&s;ervations are made by the help of In&s;tru|ments;
and thence it will follow, that if our In&s;truments, us'd for &s;uch Ob|$ervations,
be not exactly made and divided, our Ob&s;ervations cannot be
true, and if our Ob&s;ervations are not true, our Deductions from them will
not be true neither, but erroneous and fal&s;e, and con&s;equently all the re&s;t of
our Labour and Care and Skill will be needle&s;s and in&s;ignificant: And that
this is &s;o any one will ea&s;ily grant, when he con&s;iders, that in mo&s;t In&s;tru|ments
that are us'd for the Sea, which &s;eldom exceed two Foot Radius, the
&s;malle&s;t Point almo&s;t that is &s;en&s;ible is the repre&s;entation of a Minute, and
that Min$te upon the Surface of the Earth, is no le&s;s than 6086;$7/$0 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Feet, there being found 365184 Feet in one Degree of the Earth, which a|mounteth
to &s;ixty nine Miles, and eight hundred &s;ixty four Feet, or about $
part, the Statute Mile containing 1760 Yards, or 880 Fathoms; &s;o that
in the make of an In&s;trument of &s;uch a Radius, the error of the bredth of a
Needles Point in the placing the divi&s;ions of the Limb or the drawing the
Diagonal Lines or Circles, or the other parts of it, will ea&s;ily make an er|ror
of a Mile in Latitude upon the Face of the Earth, and much more in
Longitude.</P>
<P>And indeed con&s;idering the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s that is at pre&s;ent in the make of
the ordinary Sea In&s;truments made for Sale,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The defect of the common Sea In&s;tru|ments.</NOTE> and &s;everal other Imperfections,
it is well if they can be certain to ten or twelve Minutes, that is, twelve or
<PB N="524" REF="503">
fourteen Miles. Now what &s;ignifies the re&s;olving and calculating of Tri|angles
to &s;ingle minutes or le&s;&s;er parts, when you are not &s;ure by Ob&s;erva|tions
to ten. If therefore by the help of In&s;truments, &s;uch as a Plani&s;phere,
a Sector and Compa&s;&s;es all Problems may be truly protracted and re&s;olv'd
more exactly than the Ob&s;ervations can be made, on which they are ground|ed,
what need will there be of more curious Calculations? But that this
may be done, I &s;hall prove by the &s;equel of this Di&s;cour&s;e, if at lea&s;t due
care be taken in the materials making and dividing the In&s;truments, where|by
I &s;hall &s;hew that it will not only be &s;ufficiently accurate for all &s;uch u&s;es;
but it will have this of advantage al&s;o, that whereas the other method by re|&s;olving
Triangles Arithmetically is done blindly and by wrought, and with|out
a true Conception of the rea&s;on of tho&s;e Operations; this will be done
more knowingly by protracting; &s;ince that alone will be &s;ufficient to &s;hew
the rea&s;on of the Operation, and to prevent a World of mi&s;takes of one thing
for another very u&s;ual in the other way, &s;ince this way things are plac'd and
and mea&s;ured in their proper places. This I thought nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint
you with, that you might thereby &s;ee the great nece&s;&s;ity and &s;ignificant u&s;e
of &s;uch Nicene&s;s and Curio&s;ity, as I mention'd to you the la&s;t Day, in find|ing
and making the Points and drawing both the &s;traight and circular Lines
true, and that &s;uch as may have occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of &s;uch In&s;truments,
or to make them them&s;elves, as I hope &s;ome here may do, would be very
careful to &s;ee that they are made with &s;ufficient exactne&s;s, and that the Ma|terials
be &s;uch as may continue and pre&s;erve their form without warping or
&s;hrinking. But on this Subject I &s;hall &s;ay more hereafter when I treat of the
&s;everal In&s;truments them&s;elves: I &s;hall therefore at pre&s;ent proceed to the
other parts of Practical Geometry, and in the next place explain what is un|der&s;tood
by the re&s;pects that two right Lines drawn upon the &s;ame Plain,
bear to one another: This will fall under two general Heads; Fir&s;t, Such
as are equally di&s;tant from one another, and &s;o call'd Parallels: Or, Second|ly,
Such as &s;ome ways cro&s;s each other, and &s;o form an Angle between them;
for an Angle is nothing el&s;e but the Re&s;pect, Tendency, or Inclination of
two Lines in the Point wherein they cut or cro&s;s each other.</P>
<P>This Inclination of two right Lines in the Point of Inter&s;ection is computed
by the part of the Arch of a Circle drawn about the Point of inter&s;ection as a
Center intercepted between tho&s;e two Lines, and computed or compared with
the whole Circumference of that Circle; as if AB and DG cut each other
in the Point C,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 3. Tab. 10.</NOTE> and upon the Point be de&s;cribed the Circle FHKI; FE mea|&s;ures
the Angle FCE, for what part FE is of FHKIF, FCE is of four Right
Angles.</P>
<P>If the intercepted part be one quarter of the whole Circumference, then,
that Angle mea&s;ured by it is call'd a Right Angle, and the Lines are call'd
Perpendiculars to each other; as if AB and HI cro&s;&s;ing each other in the Point
C, FH be &frac14; of the whole Circumference, then is HI Perpendicular to AB and
AB to HI.</P>
<P>If the intercepted part be le&s;s than a quarter of the whole, 'tis call'd an
Acute, as the Angle ECF or BCG, becau&s;e FE or KG are each of them le&s;s
than a quarter of the Circumference, FCE and ECH making one quarter of
the Circle.</P>
<P>If the intercepted Arch be more than a quarter 'tis call'd an obtu&s;e Angle,
as ECB or FCG, which are compounded of a Right Angle and an Acute, <HI>viz.</HI>
ECH and HCB, or FCI and ICG.</P>
<P>Hence 'tis obvious that Perpendiculars make four equal or right Angles a|bout
a Point as FCH, HCB, BCI, ICF.</P>
<P>And that all other cro&s;&s;ing Lines make two Acute and two Obtu&s;e, which
four are equal to four right; and any two adjoining are equal to two Right
Angles as FCE and ECB are equal to FCH and HCB. So,</P>
<P>From hence proceeds the nece&s;&s;ity of dividing and mea&s;uring the parts of
a Circle, and finding the proportion they bear to the whole Circumference;
which is various ways performed, the mo&s;t u&s;ual and u&s;eful of which are per|form'd
by the help and mea&s;ure of &s;traight Lines, which have certain re&s;pects
both as to lengths and po&s;ition to &s;ome Diameter or Radius of the &s;aid Cir|cle,
<PB N="525" REF="504">
of which I &s;hall afterwards &s;peak; &s;uch as are Chords, Sines, Tangents,
ver&s;ed Sines or Darts.</P>
<P>A Diameter of a Circle is any &s;traight line drawn through the Center,
and terminated at each end by the Circumference, as FB, HI, or EG.</P>
<P>And a Semidiameter, which is al&s;o call'd a Radius, is equal to half the
former, being any &s;traight line drawn from the Center to the Circumference,
and terminated by them; as the half of any of the former line terminated
at one end by the Center C, as FC or CB, HC, CI, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>All Diameters of the &s;ame Circle are equal to one another, as are al&s;o all
Semidiameters or Radij, becau&s;e every part of the &s;ame Circumference is e|qually
di&s;tant from the Center.</P>
<P>If a &s;traight line be drawn within the Circle cutting the Circumference
thereof in two Points, the part of the line intercepted between tho&s;e two
Points is call'd a Chord or Subten&s;e in &s;imilitude to the String of a Bow,
&s;ubtended or &s;tretched from the ends thereof, as HG is the Chord of the Arch
HKG being extended between the ends of it H and G, and 'tis call'd the
Subten&s;e or Chord of both tho&s;e Arches or parts of the Circumference which
it divides or under which it is drawn; as of HKG, and of HFG. So a Dia|meter
is always the Chord of a Semicircle.</P>
<P>All Chords that are equal &s;ubtend equal Arches of the &s;ame Circle, be|cau&s;e
a Circle is a bent or curve Line, who&s;e bending or curviture is every
where equal and uniform, every part thereof therefore which is equal in
length mu&s;t have the &s;ame curviture, and con&s;equently the &s;ame length of
a &s;traight line extended or fubtended from its ends.</P>
<P>The&s;e Definitions or De&s;criptions will be enough for my pre&s;ent U&s;e and
Di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall therefore proceed.</P>
<P>In Practical Geometry, as every regular line is drawn or de&s;cribed by &s;ome
proper In&s;trument; &s;o every length is mea&s;ured and every divi&s;ion al&s;o made
by &s;ome proper or known mea&s;ure, by which the &s;en&s;ible truth thereof is e$|perimentally
verify'd and exhibited; I do not &s;ay demon&s;trated, as &s;ome I
perceive are very apt to do both in their Writings and Di&s;cour&s;e, who
&s;uppo&s;e the &s;hewing a thing drawn upon Paper to be that which is under|&s;tood
by Demon&s;tration; but that, I conceive, may proceed from a common,
tho' fal&s;e Acceptation of that Word, &s;ince the &s;trict and proper &s;en&s;e thereof is
much an other Notion, of which I formerly more largely di&s;cour&s;ed: And
therefore I now take it for granted, that the Principles of Speculative Geo|metry
are already known, and as &s;uch I &s;hall refer to them where I have oc|ca&s;ion
to make ue&s; of Demon&s;tration; and &s;hall not oblige my &s;elf to follow
the method of <HI>Euclid,</HI> but only treat of &s;uch parts of Practical Geometry as
relate to the Subject I have in hand.</P>
<P>Now becau&s;e I &s;hall only di&s;cour&s;e of &s;traight Lines and Circular, I have no
need at pre&s;ent to mention any other In&s;trument than a &s;traight Rule and
Compa&s;&s;es, which are the mo&s;t plain In&s;truments u&s;ed, and &s;o are &s;ufficient|ly
known &s;o as not need any thing more to be &s;aid of them than what I
have already premi&s;ed.</P>
<P>I need not al&s;o, I &s;uppo&s;e, now mention the &s;everal ways how to draw or
let fall a Perpendicular from a Point given to a line given, nor how to rai&s;e a
Perpendicular from a Point in a line given to that line; nor how to divide a
line into two equal parts, the&s;e being &s;ufficiently obvious and commonly e|nough
known. And therefore taking the&s;e for granted as already known, I
proceed to other ways of dividing a line given into &s;uch a number, or &s;uch
&s;orts of parts as &s;hall be required.</P>
<P>And Fir&s;t for dividing a given Line into any number of equal parts, the
way of proceeding is as followeth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of dividing a given Line. Tab. 10. Fig$4.</NOTE> Let AB be a line given to be divided in|to
nine equal parts, Fir&s;t, Open your Compa&s;&s;es to the length of the line,
and having one point of them in A, de&s;cribe the part of an Arch CB, then
from the Center B de&s;cribe the Arch AD, then taking with your Com|pa&s;&s;es
the di&s;tance of any point in AD as D from the point A; &s;et off the
&s;ame di&s;tance from B in he Arch BC to C. Then draw the lines ACE and
BDF, through the points AC and BD: Then opening your Compa&s;&s;es as
near as you can judge to the length of ninth part of the Line AB, the
<PB N="526" REF="505">
nearer you gue&s;s the better; and beginning at A, set off that length on AE
eight times, as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, then with the &s;ame opening of your
Compa&s;&s;es, beginning at B, &s;et off the &s;ame length eight times on BF, as
g, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, la&s;tly, laying the Rule on i and 0, 2 and n, draw the
&s;everal lines j 0, 2 n, 3 m, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> The&s;e parallel Lines &s;hall divide the line AB

of which is &s;o ea&s;y that I &s;hall not &s;tay to in&s;i&s;t upon it.</P>
<P>Next let it be required to divide a line given into all its aliquot parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To divide a line into all its aliquot parts.</NOTE> or
to give a &s;eries of parts which &s;hall be reprocal to a &s;eries in Arithmetical
proportion, as, 1, &frac12;, &frac13;, &frac14;, &frac15;, &frac16;, 1/$, <HI>&amp;c</HI> in infinitum. The method of doing it
practically may be either of the&s;e three following ways.</P>
<P>Let AB be a line given to be divided into all its aliquot parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 11. Fig. 4.</NOTE> as &frac12;, &frac13;, &frac14;, at
one of its ends, as B; cro&s;s it with the Perpendicular KI, and produce it to|wards
I, as far as there &s;hall be occa&s;ion. Then taking any Point in the line
BK at plea&s;ure as D, draw DC equal and parallel to AB and compleat the
Parallelogram AKDB. Then with your Compa&s;&s;es taking the length BD &s;et
it off from B towards I, as many times as you di&s;ire aliquot parts, as BE, EF,
FG, GH, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> then laying the Rule on the Point C, and thoe&s;e other Points
E, F, G, H, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively draw &s;traight lines which &s;hall cut the line AB in
the points 2, 3, 4, 5, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the &s;hall the line AB be thereby divided in as ma|ny
aliquot Sections as &s;hall be de&s;ir'd; for A2 &s;hall be half of AB, A3, &frac13;, A4
&frac14;, A5 &frac15;, and &s;o onward &s;o far as you will proceed; for &s;ince Dc is parallel
to AB, and equal to it the Triangles DEC, and BE2 &s;hall be &s;imilar, and
DFC and BF3 are al&s;o &s;imilar; and DGC, likewi&s;e to BG4, and &s;o onward in
infinitum. It follows therefore that as ED, 2, is to EB, 1, &s;o CD = to AB, 1, to
B2 = to $word$, = A, 2, in like manner as FD, 3, is to FB2; $o CD, 1, to B, 3, &frac13;, which
taken from AB leaves A3 = to &frac13;, and &s;o for all the re&s;t, which is obvious
enough.</P>
<P>The &s;ame might have been thus demon&s;trated; AC being made equal and
parallel to BE, EF, FG, GH, the Angle CAB will be equal to ABE, there|fore
the Triangle CA2 will be &s;imilar to EB2; and therefore as CA is to A2
in the Triangle CA2; &s;o EB will be to B2 in the Triangle EB2; but CA
is put equal to EB, therefore A2 is equal to B2, therefore A2 = $ AB. A|gain,
for the &s;ame Rea&s;ons, CA3 will be &s;imilar to FB3, and con&s;equently
CA. A3:: FB. B3; but FB is double CA, therefore B3 is double A3, there|fore
A3=&frac13; AB, and the &s;ame for all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Here in the practical performance of this Problem will appear the nece&s;&s;ity
of that nicety and exactne&s;s I pre&s;crib'd in drawing of &s;traight lines curious
and true, and placing of the points preci&s;ely in the middle of the line and
of laying the exactly &s;traight edge of the Rule over the very middle of the
Points, through which the lines, are to pa&s;s, and carrying the Needle or
Point with which you draw very equally and uniformly; for if all the&s;e par|ticulars
be not carefully ob&s;erv'd, and accordingly pracit&s;'d and perform'd,
tho' the Problem be true in the Theory, yet the divi&s;ions made upon the
line AB, will be but imperfect and lame, e&s;pecially if the line BJ be far pro|duced,
and the repetitions of the equal parts be made &s;ome &s;cores or &s;ome
hundreds of times, becau&s;e the lines drawn from the point C through the&s;e
Divi&s;ions on the line BI produced, will be &s;o oblique that a very little error
in any of tho&s;e ob&s;ervables, will be apt to make an error of a whole divi&s;ion,
and &s;o 'twill be difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h for in&s;tance between a 99th part and a
100th part, moreover becau&s;e the effecting of the Problem this way, if
the Reciprocals run far, will require the line BJ, to be drawn out to a
great length, and requireth as much room as the performing it by the Hy|perbola,
which in many occa&s;ions cannot be &s;o conveniently done, therefore
the &s;ame Problem may be effected by another way in a much le&s;s room and
with &s;horter In&s;truments, which therefore will be the le&s;s &s;ubject to warping,
and may be more carefully perfected.</P>
<P>The &s;econd way then of effecting this Problem is this:<NOTE PLACE="marg">d $span$.</NOTE> Let AB be a line
given, all who&s;e aliquot parts are de&s;ir'd as its &frac12;, &frac13;, &frac14;, &frac15;, &frac16;, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are re|ciprocals
to a rank of numbers in Arithmetical progre&s;&s;ion, as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Upon the line AB make a Parallelogram Square or Rhombus ABCD,
<PB N="527" REF="506">
then draw the Diagonal AC. Now for finding the half, draw the Diagonal
DB cro&s;&s;ing AC in E; though E draw FEG parallel to AD or CB, cutting
the line AB in G: Through D and G draw DHG cutting the Diagonal AC
in H; and through H draw IHK parallel to AD; then through D and K
draw DLK cro&s;&s;ing the Diagonal AC in L; and through the Point L draw
MLN parallel to AD, and &s;o proceeding &s;o far as &s;hall be needful or de&s;ir'd,
you &s;hall find as many aliquot parts of AB as you &s;hall de&s;ire; for as AB is
the whole, &s;o AG is the half, AK the third, AN the fourth, and &s;o you
may find the fifth, sixth, &s;eventh, eighth, ninth, and &s;o onward as far as
you plea&s;e. For Fir&s;t, the oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the Figure ABCD being equal
and parallel, the Diagonals mu&s;t inter&s;ect each other in the middle, becau&s;e
AED is &s;imilar to CEB, and therefore as AD is = CB, &s;o AE = CE and
DE = BE. Next becau&s;e the Triangles ABC and AGE are &s;imilar, as AE is
half AC, &s;o AG = AB/2.</P>
<P>Secondly, AK is &frac12; of AB; for the Triangles AHG and DHC are &s;imilar,
becau&s;e the oppo&s;ite Angles at H are equal, and the alternate Angles at A and
C are equal, as al&s;o the other alternate Angles at D and G; therefore as DC
is to AG, which is as 2 to 1, &s;o CH to AH, AH therefore is &frac13; of AC, and
becau&s;e ABC and AKH are &s;imilar, therefore as AH is = AC/3, &s;o AK = AB/3
The like Demon&s;tration will &s;erve for all the re&s;t how far &s;oever con|tinued.</P>
<P>This Problem I have been the more particular in explaining for that I
&s;hall have &s;everal occa&s;ions to make u&s;e of both in projections, and likewi&s;e
in the contrivances of &s;everal u&s;eful In&s;truments for Navigation, as parti|cularly
in a way of &s;ounding, the depths of the Sea in &s;uch places as Lines
will not reach, and in computing the way of a Ship through the Water, and
&s;everal other inventions, of which I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter.</P>
<P>Now becau&s;e the drawing of parallel Lines &s;o often as there are Divi&s;ions
made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 11. Fig 5.</NOTE> may &s;eem &s;omewhat trouble&s;ome, therefore I &s;hall &s;hew another way
how to effect this Problem without drawing parallel Lines; which is thus.
Let AB be a line given to be divided into all its aliquot parts. Through the
Points A and B draw right Lines parallel to each other, as CD and FE, whe|ther
at Right Angles or not with the line AB it matters not. Set off on each
&s;ide of each of the Points A and B in the lines &s;o drawn parallel a Point, as
C, D, E, F, of equal di&s;tance from the re&s;pective Points A and B. Then
draw CE, which &s;hall cut AB in the Point G in half; the draw AE and DB,
which likewi&s;e inter&s;ect each other in half in H; then drew CH and Dg,
which &s;hall inter&s;ect AB at I, making AI 1/3 of AB, and AE at K, making
AK 2/3 of AE; draw CK and DI, the&s;e &s;hall inter&s;ect the lines AB and AE
at L and m, making AL 1/4 of AB and AM 2/4 of AE, and &s;o proceed in infi|nitum:
This will al&s;o give you all the aliquot parts of AB or AE. Or a Se|ries
decrea&s;ing in reciprocal proportion to any Arithmetically increa&s;ing Se|ries,
as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in infinitum. The Demon&s;tration of which
Problem is much the &s;ame with that in the preceding Problem, and therefore
I &s;hall not &s;pend time in the repetition thereof.</P>
<P>And thus far I have proceeded to &s;hew how any line given may be divided
into an infinite Series of Reciprocals to a Series in Arithmetical Progre&s;&s;ion,
of which &s;ort I have only in&s;tanced in that Reciprocal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c.
but the &s;ame method will &s;erve to give the Reciprocal to the Series that ex|pre&s;&s;es
the differences between &s;quare numbers of the prime Arithmetical
Series, as 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or any other &s;uch Arithmetical Progre&s;&s;ion, what|&s;oever
the common exce&s;s or difference be, as I could plainly demon&s;trate if
it were material to my pre&s;ent de&s;ign, and may hereafter more at large up|on
another Subject: but I &s;hall now rather proceed to &s;hew how any line given
may be divided into an infinite &s;eries of Parts in Geometrical Proportion
continually decrea&s;ing or increa&s;ing, according to any proportion whatever
a&s;&s;ign'd, as 1, &frac12;, &frac14;, &frac16;, 1/$$, 2/32, 1/64, and &s;o onward in infinitum: Or, 1, &frac13;, $/$, 1/$7,
1/12, 1/43, and &s;o onward to any proportional le&s;s then can be a&s;&s;ign'd, and how
<PB N="528" REF="507">
to find the &s;um of &s;uch an infinite decrea&s;ing Series or a line equal to them,
all added together.</P>
<P>To effect which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 11. Fig. 6.</NOTE> let AB be a Line given to be divided into an infinite &s;e|ries
of Geometrical proportionals, according to any Ratio given; as &s;up|po&s;e
of 1000 to 999, or any other Ratio whatever; for in&s;tance, let it be
of 8 to 7 cro&s;s the line AB at the point or end A with another &s;traight
line, as CAD, which may be drawn at Right Angles, or any other Angle
pretty near it, for the &s;ame effect will follow; then opening your Compa&s;&s;es
to any di&s;tance, but as near as you can gue&s;s to an eighth part of the length
of the Line CD, <HI>viz.</HI> according to the conveniences you may have of draw|ing
or producing the &s;aid Line on the Plain or Table you are delineating up|on
and &s;etting one Foot in A, &s;et off the &s;ame eighth part from A to C on
one &s;ide of the Point A; Then on the other &s;ide set off the &s;aiddi&s;tance
AC &s;even times, <HI>viz.</HI> to D. Then draw from the Point C the Line CE par|rallel
to AB, and from the Point B to draw BE parallel to AC, &s;o as to com|pleat
the Parallellogram or Rhombus ABEC; then through the Points
D and E, draw the Line DE, cutting the Line AB in F; through F draw
FG parallel to AC or BE; and through D and G draw DG cutting the
Line AB in H; through H draw HJ parallel to AC or BE, and draw DJ,
cutting AB in K; and through K draw KL parallel to AC, and &s;o proceed
to draw DL, Mn, Dn, Op, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as far as you plea&s;e. The&s;e Points F, H, K,
M, K, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hall divide the Line AB into a &s;eries of Geometrical continued
proportionals in the Ratio of 8 to 7, as was de&s;crib'd or requir'd to be
done: For AB &s;hall be to AF, as 8 to 7, AF. AI,:: 8. 7, and AH. AK
:: 8. 7, and &s;o onward in infinitum, or as far as &s;hall be requir'd; and not
only &s;o, but the whole line AB &s;hall be made up or compounded of an infi|nite
&s;eries of continual proportionals, in proportion as 8 to 7, all which in|finity
of proportionals being joined or added together into one line will be
equal to the line AB, and neither exceed it, nor be &s;horter than it.</P>
<P>Now that this divi&s;ion will be rightly done, will appear by the following
Demon&s;tration is requir'd to be done; DC al&s;o being a &s;traight Line touch|ing
the Line AB in A; and DE being a &s;traight Line cutting the Line AB
In F; the two Triangles DCE and DAF will be &s;imilar; and con&s;equently
as DC to DA, which, by the con&s;truction, is made, is as 8 to 7, as was re|quir'd;
&s;o CE (which was put equal to AB) to AF. In the &s;ame manner
FG being drawn parallel to AC, CG and AF are equal, and the Line DG
being drawn cutting the remainder AF in H; he two Triangles DCG and
DAH are al&s;o &s;imilar, and con&s;equently as DC to DA; &s;o is CG (which
is equal to AF) to AH. Now DC to DA is put as 8 to 7, therefore al&s;o
AF to AH is as 8 to 7, as was requir'd: By the &s;ame Ratiocination, may all
the re&s;t of the infinite proportionals be proved to be to one another, as 8 to
7, and con&s;equently they will be all an infinite &s;eries of continued proporti|onals,
decrea&s;ing infinitely in proportion as 8 to 7' which was the thing re|quir'd.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince the whole Line AB, and the Ablata AF, AH, AK, AM, are
in continual proportion, as 8 to 7, as is prov'd the Reliqua BF, FH, HK,
KM, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will be al&s;o in the &s;ame Geometrical continu'd proportion one to
another, as 8 to 7, as evident by the 17th of the 5th of <HI>Euclid,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>To expre&s;s the&s;e Proportionals in Numbers is very difficult, but if this
Series he expre&s;s'd Algebraical it will be ea&s;ily perform'd; for putting the fir&s;t
difference a, and the &s;econd, b, it will be this, a, b, bb 3b b4b b5/a a2 a3 a4 <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This method of finding and ea&s;ily de&s;cribing a Rank or Series of conti|nual
proportionals, I have the rather cho&s;en to explain and demon&s;trate by
this Problem, becau&s;e by means hereof the true Nature of Logarithms and the
Logarithmick Line will the more plainly be under&s;tood and comprehended,
which by rea&s;on of the re&s;ervedne&s;s and de&s;ign'd ob&s;curity of mo&s;t of tho&s;e
who have written concerning the method of compounding and forming the
Logarithmick Tables, are not o obvious to every Reader; for in this pre&s;ent
<PB N="529" REF="508">
Problem, if the continual Proportionals BF, FH, HK, KM, MO, and all
the re&s;t be put for the ab&s;olute Numbers: Then BE, BE&mdash;FG, BE&mdash;FG,
&mdash;HI. BE&mdash;FG,&mdash;HI&mdash;KL. will be the Logarithms to tho&s;e Numbers, that
is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for Logarithms are nothing el&s;e but the Numbers
of the proportionals that are in the Series pitch'd upon, or made choice of
between any two ab&s;olute Numbers (or becau&s;e a unite is the fir&s;t and root of
all other Numbers) between one and any other ab&s;olute Number what&s;oever.
And to that end in the making of Logarithms, becau&s;e if the proportional
difference between the antecedent and the con&s;equent be very great, it will
hardly fall out, that any of the proportional Sections will either fall in the
equal Section of the ab&s;olute Number exactly, or &s;o near the &s;ame' as will be
&s;ufficient to make the number of the proportional differences exact enough to
&s;erve for the Logarithm; therefore the greater the number of tho&s;e propor|tionals
are between the unite and the other ab&s;olute number, the nearer will
the equal divi&s;ions of the interjacent &s;pace approach the proportional Secti|ons
of the &s;ame; and by the increa&s;ing the numbers of the intermediate
proportionals, if the equal divi&s;ions do not <HI>coincidere</HI> with the proportionate
exactly, yet the approach may be made within any difference what&s;oever re|quired,
which is all that the nature of the thing, in &s;ome ca&s;es, will bear, they
being infinite and incommen&s;urate; for the making of which Logarithmick
Numbers or Tables various ways have been made u&s;e of by &s;everal Authors,
&s;ome more ea&s;y in the Invention than others, yet they are all to the &s;ame
effect, tho' &s;ome of the Progre&s;&s;ions are more accommodated for u&s;e than
others; as that of <HI>Mr. Briggs,</HI> where the Logarithm of one is, put a, 0,
and the Logaritthm of 10, 1 of 100. 2 of 1000. 3 of 10000. 4 with a cer|tain
number of Cyphers after them, as <HI>Mr. Briggs</HI> puts 14. So that he &s;up|po&s;eth
One hundred Millions of Millions of proportional parts between
one and ten, and between 10 and 100, and between 100 and 1000, and &s;o
onward in the Decimal progre&s;&s;ion; or between 1 and 1/$0 and 1/100, and
1/$00, and 1/1000, of which in 100 Millions of Millions, there are thirty Mil|lions
of Millions, One Hundred and Two Thou&s;ands, 999 Millions, 566
Thou&s;ands, 368 continual proportionals between one and two; and be|cau&s;e
it would be impo&s;&s;ible ever to enumerate and calculate all the&s;e, there|fore
there have been various Expedients found to facilite this <HI>toedium</HI> of work|ing
proportionals by Multiplications and Divi&s;ions, and extractions of the
Roots, and to perform the &s;ame thing for finding the Logarithms or the
number of proportionals in the &s;eries pitch'd upon, an&s;wering to each ab|&s;olute
number, by little more trouble than bare addition, which doth &s;ave
an infinite of trouble; and con&s;idering the great U&s;e and Benefit of them in
&s;olving many difficult and almo&s;t in&s;olvable Que&s;tions of Geometry by any
other way, is a part of Geometry extreamly de&s;irable to be thoroughly
known and under&s;tood, neverthele&s;s it being not &s;o much to my pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e,
and belonging more particularly to the bu&s;ine&s;s of Arithmetick, I
&s;hall not further proceed in the explication thereof at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>But rather proceed to the Explication of the Logarithmick Line, and
&s;hew how it depends upon the Problem I have now explained, of dividing a
Line given into any infinite &s;eries of continual proportionals, becau&s;e, as I
&s;hall after prove, die &s;ame is the true Line of the Rumb in tho&s;e projections
which I de&s;ign to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Let AB then in the &s;econd Figure repre&s;ent the Radius,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 12. Fig. 1.</NOTE> BC a line at right
Angles with it, and equal to it the tangent of forty five Degrees, which is
to be divided into an infinite &s;eries of continual proportionals; &s;o that BC
to BG &s;hall be as any one number to any other number a&s;&s;igned. For in|&s;tance,
as 100000 to 99999, make Bd equal to $word$ part of AB, and
draw de parallel to BC; them make ds, st, tv, vx, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> each equal to dB, and
draw the lanes s, 1. t, 2. v, 3. x 4. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> parallel to BC. Then proceed to
divide the Line BC into the &s;eries of proportionals cg, gi, jl, In, np, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
as I &s;hew'd in the preceeding, Problem; and through the Points g, i, l, n, p,
draw the Lines gf, i 1. l 2, N 3. P 4, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> parallel to the Line AB meeting or
cutting the fore-&s;aid Parallels de s 1. f 2. V 3. X 4. in the Points f, 1, 2, 3, 4,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Curve Line drawn through the Points C, f 1, 2, 3, 4, will repre&s;ent
<PB N="530" REF="509">
the Logarithmick broken Line being compo&s;ed of the Diagonal Lines fC,
hg, ki, ml, on <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in which BC, df, s i, f 2, v 3, x 4, the ordinates to
the Line AB, &s;hall repre&s;ent the ab&s;olute numbers which are here a rank of
continual proportionals an&s;wering to the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, B or nought,
and Bd, Bs, Bt, Bv, Bx. The re&s;pective Logarithms to them increa&s;ing as the
ab&s;olute do decrea&s;e, according to <HI>Neiper</HI>'s method, or el&s;e BX, DX, SX,
TX, VX, X, or o, will repre&s;ent the Logarithms decrea&s;ing as the ab&s;olute
decrea&s;e, according to Mr. <HI>Briggs</HI> and mo&s;t others.</P>
<P>This Line which I have here de&s;cribed is not a true Curve Line, but a Line
compos'd of fragments or &s;hort pieces of &s;traight Lines, <HI>viz.</HI> of the &s;traight
Lines of cf, gh, ik, lm, no, pq, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are all Secants to the Radius bd
of the continual proportionals put as tangents, becau&s;e fg, hi, kl, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are
all equal and parallel to it; and as AC the Secant of 45 is to AB; &s;o fc to
fg = dB as Radius; &s;o fi = gh, 12 = ik, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o cfi 2, 3, 4, 5, is equal to the &s;e|veral
Secants Cf; gh, ik, lm, no, pq, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and &s;uppo&s;ing dB one infinite part
of AB, the&s;e fractures will be infinitely &s;mall, and &s;o the Logarithmick Line
or Rhumb-line will be a true Curve Line compos'd of infinite of the&s;e infi|nitely
&s;mall Secants.</P>
<P>From which Generation of this Curve Logarithmick or Rhumb-line, may
be deduc'd, Fir&s;t, That the Line AB being infinitely continu'd towards A,
&s;hall be the A&s;ymptot Line to the Logarithmick Curve cf, 1, 2, 3, 4, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
nearer and nearer, to which it &s;hall always approach, but never touch it.</P>
<P>Secondly, That if from any Point of this Line infinitely continued either
way a perpendicular or ordinate to AB be drawn, and al&s;o a tangent, the di|&s;tance
between the ordinate and tangent inter&s;ection of the A&s;ymptot &s;hall
always be equal to the di&s;tance AB; from which propriety the mechanical
De&s;cription thereof, with great exactne&s;s and certainty, I &s;hall prove to be
ea&s;y.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e this Line may be various other ways de&s;crib'd al&s;o which will
al&s;o give light to the Nature of it; it may be conceived to be generated by
the compo&s;ition of two differing kinds of motions cro&s;&s;ing each other at
right Angles with differing tendency and velocities.</P>
<P>As &s;uppo&s;ing a Point or Atom at C, actuated by two equal tendencies or
velocities, the other towards W. Suppo&s;ing the velocity towards C to re|main
always the &s;ame, and uniform the motion or velocity towards W wil
continually increa&s;e &s;o that when the Atom has pa&s;t, for in&s;tance, 1/10 of
the di&s;tance between CW and AB, the velocity from BC towards AW will
he as 10/9 and at the end of the &s;econd &s;pace of time, as 1/8, of the third, as
10/7, of the fourth, as 1/$, and &s;o 10/2, $/4, 10/3$, $$/7, and 10, and &s;o onwards in
infinitum.</P>
<P>If on the other &s;ide we &s;uppo&s;e the tendency, velocity or motion from BC
towards AW, to be always equal and uniform, that is, in a certain &s;pace of
time, to move a &s;pace equal to one tenth of the length CB, then the motion or
velocity from CW towards AB, will decrea&s;e continually by an infinite &s;eries
of continual Proportionals, according to the differing velocities of the two
tendencies. The&s;e Proprieties I have not now time to demon&s;trate fully as
they ought, but &s;hall re&s;erve them to another opportunity.</P>
<P>THere being mention made at Page 524.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 12. Fig. 2.</NOTE> above, of an In&s;trument for drawing
Spirals or Rhumbs but not de&s;cribed I have here added a &s;hort de&s;cription

which the Line is to be drawn: As the end of this Ruler c there mu&s;t be cut a
round hole with a Ring of Bra&s;s exactly fitted to it, and in this Ring a &s;mall Truckle
Wheel with its Axis well fixt at right Angles: Then by moving this Ring in its So|cket
in the Ruler, the plain of the Wheel may be &s;et to any Angle with the &s;lit in the
Ruler; which done, by moving the Ruler upon the Plain round the Center, the edge
of the &s;aid Truckle-wheel will de&s;cribe, upon the Plain, the Spiral with the Angle re|quired
at every revolution proportionally approaching the fixt Center. E is the Tru|ckle-wheel
and Ring taken-out of its Socket in the Ruler.</P>

<P><HI>MAy 8th</HI> 1685. It is a Po&s;tulatum in Geometry, that 'tis po&s;&s;ible or
practicable to draw or de&s;cribe a Circle to any given Radius, and al|&s;o
from a Point given to any other Point to draw a &s;traight Line; but tho'
in Speculative Geometry it be only to be under&s;tood, that a Circle of any
bigne&s;s may be conceived as drawn about a Center given, or a &s;traight Line
may be conceived to be drawn between any two Points given; yet in Practi|cal
Geometry where the <HI>Po&s;tulata</HI> are to be produc'd to effect and to be actual|ly
executed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difficulty of drawing a &s;trait Line.</NOTE> if either of them are very large, the difficulties are greater
the every one will ea&s;ily imagine, and neither the one nor the other can,
with any tolerable exactne&s;s, be perform'd. 'Tis true that a Line may be
extended and &s;treined between two Points at a con&s;ide&s;rable di&s;tance, and be
that Line may be &s;aid to be a &s;traight Line as to its &s;warving laterally; but
as to its &s;traightne&s;s in the Perpendicular Plain that pa&s;&s;es through tho&s;e two
Points, 'tis not in the power of Art to make it; for that the power of gra|vity
acting on it will bend it into a Curve (which has of late Years much
excerci&s;ed the Speculative Geometers to contemplate, they have given
it the name of the <HI>catenaria</HI>) but none have found any ways of de&s;cribing it
otherwi&s;e than by Points, which are very trouble&s;ome and tedious, and at
be&s;t but imperfect (which yet &s;hall &s;hew how to do &s;ome other time) but I at
prefe$r only mention it by the by, to &s;hew, that tho' a Line may be
&s;trained between two Points, yet gravity will bend it from its &s;traightne&s;&s;
and tho' tis Po&s;&s;ible in great part to take off that gravity by a fluid, in which
the &s;ai$ Line &s;hall be immers'd yet that for a great length will not obviate
the Objective. 'Tis true, if the Points be plac'd perpendicular one over an|other,
a Line may be extended &s;traight without any impediment from gra|vity,
but then any motion of the Air, through which it pa&s;&s;es, is apt to
bend it &s;ome ways or other, &s;o that even that way is not free from Objecti|ons.
And I found in my Ob&s;ervation of the Parallax of the Earth, that
there was very much trouble and difficulty to find the true Perpendicular
Point under the Center of the Object-gla&s;s, which yet with per&s;everance, I
conceive, I did at la&s;t attain. However &s;ome have propounded ways of
performing that Ob&s;ervation which have ten times the difficulty to execute
it to any tolerable &s;ati&s;faction that was found in mine.</P>
<P>Now as this fir&s;t <HI>Po&s;tulatum</HI> of actually drawing a &s;traight Line between a|ny
two Points has its difficulties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$</NOTE> &s;o the next of drawing a Circle to a Center
and Radius given, has many more, e&s;pecially when the Radius is large. 'Tis
almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to make a Beam for the Compa&s;s that is to de&s;cribe it that
&s;hall not bend and warp, and &s;hrink and &s;tretch in the u&s;ing of it; and I re|member
when Mr. <HI>Reeve</HI> was to make a Gage for a Tool to grind an Object-gla&s;s
for a Tele&s;cope of &s;ixty Foot, after much Charge an Labour to per|form
it, tho' all po&s;&s;ible care and caution was imploy'd to effect it, yet after
all he was near a Month in Gaging his Tool before he could bring it to any
tolerable perfection, and even then he found it not to be of a Sphere of its
due length, but con&s;iderably le&s;s; which caus'd me to contrive a way how to
do it true at once with a much le&s;s aparatus, and that of as great a Sphere as
&s;hould be requir'd, as of &s;ix hundred as well as of &s;ixty Foot, which I pub|li&s;h'd
in my Micographia in the Year 1664; but one <HI>Campani</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> above
ten Years after publi&s;h'd the &s;ame thing as his own Invention, not taking any
notice of what I had done. I know Mr. <HI>Auzout</HI> Objected, that there were
&s;ome difficulties in adju&s;ting the Machin, but I &s;oon &s;atisfy'd him that they
were all in&s;ignificant.</P>
<P><PB N="532" REF="511">
So that we &s;ee, that tho' Science can ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e and conceive things as
po&s;&s;ible to be done, yet Art doth find many difficulties in the actual perfor|mance
of them, and both ought to be call'd in for a&s;&s;i&s;tants in the pro&s;ecu|tion
of experimental Philo&s;ophy: Wherefore there ought to be as much care
taken for the improving and perfecting of Art, as there is requir'd Sagacity
and Per&s;picacity in ob&s;erving the effects and methods of Nature.</P>
<P>Now Nature in its Operations, is, for the mo&s;t part, Regular, Con&s;tant,
Exact, Potent and Effective, and what&s;oever is thereby de&s;ign'd, it, accom|modates
all things nece&s;&s;ary to the performance thereof; it not only makes
the Materials of a proper Sub&s;tance, but it &s;hapes the parts of their due
Figure, and joins them in their due order, and actuates or moves them with
proper motions. But Art, which at be&s;t does but mimick Nature, mu&s;t
&s;earch for materials where it can find them, and make u&s;e of &s;uch as can be
procur'd. The&s;e it mu&s;t &s;hape and fit for its purpo&s;es as the Matter will
indure, and as the Tools and In&s;truments, made u&s;e of, will perform, and
they mu&s;t be join'd and compos'd together as other circum&s;tances will per|mit,
and actuated by uncertain, irregular and in&s;ufficient Powers. So that
at be&s;t the productions of Art in re&s;pect of tho&s;e of Nature, are very much
inferior in perfection.</P>
<P>And yet they are of great &s;ignificancy for the accommodating the producti|ons
of Nature to the u&s;e of Mankind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The benefits of Art.</NOTE> Thus Art doth form a Ship to pa&s;s
the Seas as big as the large&s;t Fi&s;h, which it animates and directs with Men,
and makes the Wind to move and convey from Port to Port. Art doth
often al&s;o help and promote Natures Operations; as it improves the Sight
by Spectacles, Micro&s;copes and Tele&s;copes. It divides and mea&s;ures the
parts and intervals of Time by Watches: It converts Corn into Bread by
&s;eparating the Husks and Bran by the Sive and Scarce, kneading the more
nutritive part into Dough, and la&s;t of all baking it in the Oven. And the
Fruit of the Vine it improves to a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Spirituous Liquour for drink.
We owe almo&s;t all our Accommodations of our Life to the productions of
Art. Nature puts us into the World more naked than mo&s;t other of our
fellow Creatures; but Art has abundantly &s;upply'd that Defect, by accom|modating
the teguments of other Animals and Vegetables for that purpo&s;e.
Nay, Minerals al&s;o and Metals have been made &s;ub&s;ervient. I might in|&s;tance
al&s;o in infinite other accommodations and conveniences of Life. So
that tho' Art be far &s;hort of Nature in perfection of acting, yet &s;ince the
power of it is placed in Man, it &s;eems to be of as great a concern to him
to be knowing and potent therein; for every new di&s;covery therein gives
him a new Power which he had not before. Thus the di&s;covery of the Mag|netical
Needle inabl'd him to cro&s;s the Ocean and di&s;cover a New World;
and to incompa&s;s the Earth and conver&s;e with the remote&s;t Inhabitants.
Thus the di&s;covery of Tele&s;copes inabled him to di&s;cover Caele&s;tial Bodies
never &s;o much as dreamt of before; and the Mi&s;cro&s;cope has di&s;cover'd a
New World which was before wholly invi&s;ible. The discovery of the Pen|dulum
has actually proved the inequality of the length of Days, and divid|ed
the intervals of Time more exactly than the Sun.</P>
<P>The di&s;covery of Gun-powder and Guns has chang'd the whole method of
offence, and defence both by Land and Sea. I might in&s;tance in many o|ther
effects of Art to &s;hew how much the Power of Man is increa&s;ed by
them: but the&s;e are &s;ufficient, and by the&s;e we may be inabled to judge of
their &s;ignificancy when they are made u&s;e of as they ought.</P>
<P>By the&s;e al&s;o we may be &s;ufficiently inform'd how much a new Di&s;covery
or Observation may be con&s;iderable when duly apply'd, tho' in it&s;elf it &s;eems
never &s;o obvious, &s;light and common, as to in&s;tance in the Pendulum, or in
Printing, the grounds of which were &s;ufficiently obvious to all, and there|fore
&s;lighted, whereas the due application of them has perform'd almo&s;t mi|racles.
And there are other things as obvious as them, which being duly
apply'd, will be as effective tho' in another kind. An Experiment or Di&s;|covery
is not therefore to be &s;lighted, becau&s;e, when it is &s;hewn, it &s;eems
ea&s;y, and obvious, and trivial, and becau&s;e the con&s;equences or u&s;es thereof
are not pre&s;ently detected.</P>
<P><PB N="533" REF="512">
What I &s;ome Weeks &s;ince propounded concerning the drawing of a Circle
true to a large Radius, I do very much doubt whether the be&s;t Mechanick, it
&s;hould be propounded to, would pre&s;ently be able to effect it; which I am the
more inclin'd to believe from the Experimets I have &s;een try'd to that effect,
by the mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Per&s;ons both for Science and Art; and yet when
di&s;cover'd, I doubt not but almo&s;t every one will be apt to &s;ay, he knew as
much; and yet I do not find that any one has mention'd it in their Writing.
<HI>Guidus Vbaldus</HI> and <HI>Stoffler</HI> have &s;hewn a way of drawing a part of a Circle
of a large Radius by the help of two Rulers fix'd at a proper Angle, and
&s;liding again&s;t two Pinns at the extreamities of the Arch to be de&s;crib'd, which
is founded on a propo&s;ition of <HI>Euclid;</HI> but our Mathematical-In&s;trument-ma|kers
&s;eldom or never make u&s;e thereof, becau&s;e of the difficulty of its u&s;e,
and imperfection of its performance; and tho' Mr. <HI>Reeve</HI> had procured one
made with great exactne&s;s, yet it did not perform its effects; but he made a
Beam compa&s;s of &s;ixty Foot Radius, which did it not much better, by rea&s;on
of the warping at &s;o great a length, which I conceive al&s;o Sir <HI>Chr. Wren</HI>
complain'd of in &s;triking the Circle for the Dome at St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, tho', for
that effect, it were accurate enough. The Mathematical-|In&s;trument-makers
in&s;tead of the Angular Rule make u&s;e of a Steel Bow, which they can,
by a Screw, bend more or le&s;s as they have occa&s;ion, and &s;o can &s;trike a &s;mall
Arch of a Curve, which, tho' not exact, is yet near enough to the Arch of
a Circle they have occa&s;ion to make upon their In&s;trument, and &s;erves
well enough for common u&s;e in &s;mall In&s;truments; but where the In&s;tru|ments
are large and the Arches great, the irregularity may be di&s;cover'd;
and if a Plani&s;pherical$ projection of a Sphere of twenty or thirty Foot Dia|meter
were to be drawn, both the&s;e Inventions would be in&s;ignificant.</P>
<P>The contrivance which I &s;hall at pre&s;ent de&s;cribe is &s;uch as will perform
what is nece&s;&s;ary for the de&s;cribing a Circle of two hundred or three hundr|ed
Foot of Diameter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The method for drawing large Circles.</NOTE> which for mo&s;t u&s;es in making In&s;truments or Mapps

Gages for Gla&s;s Tools or Di&s;hes larger than any have been yet made;
tho' for &s;uch Tools indeed, the method I have de&s;crib'd in my Micrography

<P><HI>Thur&s;day, May</HI> 16. The Royal Society met, I di&s;cours'd of my In&s;trument
to draw a great Circle, and produc'd an In&s;trument I had provided for that
purpo&s;e, and therewith, by the direction of a Wire about a hundred Foot
long, I &s;hew'd how to draw a Circle of that Radius; which gave &s;atisfaction;
the way was by a &s;mall Truckle-wheel fix'd in a thin Ruler, &s;o that the Axis
of the Truckle kept parallel to the extended Wire Radius. Which Ruler
had two 'all Staples fix'd in it, through which the Wire could ea&s;ily &s;lip
to and fro. I explain&s;md al&s;o to them the other way of fixing the Truckle at
the end of a &s;mall long Pipe of Bra&s;s that had a hole at the Center of each
end, through which holes that Wire was to pa&s;s that was extended from the
Center, and the &s;ame Truckle being always at right Angles with the Radi|ant
Wire, and the Wire being free to &s;lip to and fro in the holes, the edge
of the Truckle would de&s;cribe the Arch of the Circle exact.</P>

thought of that proper u&s;e for it. What I &s;hew'd an Experiment of and ex|plain'd

to have been &s;ooner thought of, by &s;uch as may have had occa&s;ion for its u&s;e,
and yet I never found the lea&s;t mention made of it in any Author I have yet
met with. That contrivance will &s;erve very well for de&s;cribing a Circle of
two, three or four hundred Foot Diameter, and will de&s;cribe it as exactly and
curiou&s;ly as any &s;mall Beam Compa&s;s will do a Circle of two, three or four
Foot. But when it doth exceed a certain length, even that al&s;o will begin
to fail, and the difficulties will much increa&s;e; for that a Wire will be too
weak to bear a weight &s;ufficient to &s;train it near enough to a &s;traight; &s;o
that there is in this way al&s;o a <HI>a non plus ultra,</HI> but <HI>e&s;t aliquid Prodire tenus;</HI>
this is much farther than could be done any other way; and by this way, if
a true plain be given, any part, or even a whole Circle may be di&s;crib'd of
as great a Diameter as I have already mention'd.</P>
<P>But if a greater be yet nece&s;&s;ary, Mechanicks do hitherto fail us, and
Nature al&s;o gives us none greater nor le&s;s than the Circumference of the
Earth, and that in the Surface of the Water, when the Air is Stagnant, or
without Wind, or in the Surface of &s;uch Water frozen into Ice. But this is
&s;o great a Spherical Surface, that it can be of no Mechanical u&s;e that I yet
know of, unle&s;s it be to afford us a Plain large enough to de&s;cribe a large
Circle upon, which is otherwi&s;e difficult enough to be procur'd. But when
we have procur'd &s;uch a Plain by the help of Nature in this manner by freez|ing,
yet to du&s;cribe a Circle of a thou&s;and or two thou&s;and Foot Diameter,
will be impo&s;&s;ible by any way I have yet met with; and yet I think it not
beyond the power of Art, nay, tho' one of twice that magnitude were it
nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>And tho' it may be difficult enough to find a way before it be &s;hewn, yet
when di&s;cover'd, every one will be ready enough to &s;ay, 'tis ea&s;y to do, and
that it was obvious to be thought of and invented; for that indeed every
one &s;ees the Experiment of it daily, and yet no one has thought of applying
it to this purpo&s;e, as in the in&s;tance I ju&s;t now mention'd of the Pendulum:
And that I may the more Plainly evidence this, I have prepar'd an apparatus
for the effecting thereof experimentally; which, tho' it be not a compleat
In&s;trument, &s;uch as I de&s;ign to have made (when I can procure a proper
Workman at lei&s;ure) yet by this, and the demon&s;tration of the truth of the
Grounds and Rea&s;ons thereof, it will be put out of doubt. This Apparatus,
and the demon&s;tration, I will pre&s;ently produce.</P>
<P>THe Author not having given any farther de&s;cription of his way, and the Ap|paratus
of performing it, I thought it might be acceptable to tran&s;cribe the
account of it as I found it enter'd in the Journal of the Royal Society as follows.
<HI>May</HI> 22. 1695. Dr. <HI>Hook</HI> produced and read an account of an In&s;trument for de|&s;cribing
a very great Circle, being, by the help of two rouling Circles or Truokles in
the two ends of a Rule, made &s;o as to be turn'd in their Sockets to any a&s;&s;igned An|gle,
thereby to become the two Tangents of any great Circle to be de&s;cribed; the in|clination
of the plains of the two little rouling Circles being always equal to the An|gle,
the length of the Ruler &s;ubtends to the Radius of the Circle propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>This is all I find concerning it; it were to be wi&s;ht there had been &s;ome draught
thereof pre&s;erved; but this way may be better apprehended by the next following.</P>

<P><HI>June</HI> 20. 1695. I have in my former Di&s;cour&s;es or Lectures &s;hewn &s;ome
new methods of de&s;cribing the Arches of very large Circles, &s;uch as are very
hardly po&s;&s;ible to be de&s;crib'd by any other way, at lea&s;t not to that ex|actne&s;s,
nor without almo&s;t infinitely more trouble and labour; and the&s;e
by In&s;truments ea&s;y enough to be made and u&s;ed, and as ea&s;y to be under|&s;tood
and demon&s;trated, and tho&s;e founded on Experiments and Practices &s;o
univer&s;ally known, that one would wonder how &s;uch an application as this
<PB N="535" REF="514">
&s;hould not be thought of by any one that had occa&s;ion for the u&s;e of it; and
this the rather, becau&s;e we know it to be the rea&s;on on which is founded the
practice not ony of turning the Waggons, Coaches, and &s;uch other four
Wheel'd Carriages, but al&s;o of Boats, Lighters, Ships, and other Ve&s;&s;els;
as al&s;o Fi&s;hes for moving upon and through the Water, and of Hawks, Kites,
and other Birds which move through the Air. But we need not much won|der
neither, when we con&s;ider at the &s;ame time how obvious the grounds of
the Art of Printing were by the u&s;e of Seales, and of rectifying Clocks by
the u&s;e of Pendulums, and yet how long the World was without tho&s;e Arts
before they were thought of for tho&s;e purpo&s;es and reduc'd to practice. The
true cau&s;e of which is the unwillingne&s;s that Men generally have to be at
the trouble of thinking and meditating, e&s;pecially when they ob&s;erve that
tho&s;e that are &s;o, do generally reap nothing for all their Labour, but either
Contempt, and the nicknames of Madmen and Projectors, or the Emulations
of others, which creates them continual troubles. Nor is there le&s;s difficul|ty
in procuring the In&s;truments or Apparatus nece&s;&s;ary to put a new Inven|tion
into u&s;e and practice, than to invent and contrive the &s;ame; for Work|men
are generally very unwilling to be put out of their common Road of work|ing
and make a hundred Objections before they will undertake, and very
often make as many mi&s;takes in the performing, before they will rightly exe|cute
what is de&s;ir'd; and the inventer mu&s;t be content not only to afford
them his patience, but his Pur&s;e al&s;o, otherwi&s;e no further progre&s;s is to be
expected, and often al&s;o, tho' both are &s;upply'd, yet nothing will procure a|ny
further trials; and new hands mu&s;t be fought, where po&s;&s;ibly the inven|tor
&s;peeds little better; but &s;uppo&s;ing him at la&s;t to have executed his de|&s;ign
and made his purcha&s;e, what has he got but &s;ome <HI>Difficiles Nugae,</HI> &s;ome
new <HI>Swing Swangs,</HI> which were the names that the Barometer for the Wea|ther,
and the Pendulums for Clocks did a long time bear; but when Truth
at length doth prevail, and the u&s;efulne&s;s of an Invention appears, then e|very
one claims it for his own, tho' po&s;&s;ibly he never had the thought of it,
'till all the World knew it. The&s;e may be &s;ome of the rea&s;ons why inven|tions
have come &s;o thin and &s;eldom into the World: And why many parts
of u&s;eful Knowledge do yet remain undi&s;cover'd; nor can we well expect
that they &s;hould be more frequent, 'till the allurements that &s;hould prompt
the Inquiry have another appearance. However, whether from the Genius
of the&s;e later Ages, or from the increa&s;e of Literature by the propagation
and communication of Knowledge by Printing, or from &s;ome other happy
influence from above; we have found that the pre&s;ent Age has been much
more fruitful in that kind than many preceeding, and we may hope that the
approaching may be yet more, if at lea&s;t <HI>invenire di&s;camus invienendo, ut Scri|bendo
di&s;cimus &s;cribere; Nam Res dat lumina Rebus.</HI> This was one cau&s;e why I
contriv'd the following addition to what I have already explain'd concerning
the methods of de&s;cribing very large Circles. The fir&s;t of which was how to
de&s;cribe &s;uch a Circle about a Center given, and the length of the Radius, and
that of &s;o great a length, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for to make any Beam
Compa&s;s long enough to perform it without warping and bending, or any
&s;tring &s;trong enough to do it without &s;tretching and &s;hrinking; all which in|conveniences
I have thereby &s;hew'd how to obviate mo&s;t ea&s;ily by making u&s;e
of one &s;mall Truckle put upon a Wire &s;train'd from &s;uch a Center to its Cir|cumference.
The &s;econd way was how to de&s;cribe a Circle, or any part of
it be the Radius almo&s;t never &s;o great, and that without knowing or mak|ing
any u&s;e of the Center, but only upon knowing the length of the Radius
or the de&s;ir'd Magnitude of &s;uch a Circle, or the Magnitude of the Subten&s;e
of the Arch of a Degree, Minute or Second, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of &s;uch a Circle. Now
becau&s;e there may be yet another condition de&s;irable for &s;ome occa&s;ions,
which cannot be well perform'd by either of tho&s;e methods, and yet may be
of nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e for the &s;olving of &s;ome Problems, or the actual execution of
&s;ome De&s;igns; upon further contemplating this Subject I have contriv'd this
pre&s;ent Addition; and that is to draw the Arch of a Circle to a Center at a
con&s;iderable di&s;tance, where the Center cannot well be approach'd, or where,
by rea&s;on of incumbrances interjacent, a Wire cannot be extended; as from
<PB N="536" REF="515">
the top of a Pole let up in the mid&s;t of a Wood, or from the &s;pindle of a
Vane at the top of a Tower in a City, or from a point on the other &s;ide of a
River, or in a Lake or Mora&s;s; in all which the Center cannot conveniently
be approach'd or come at otherwi&s;e than by the Sight. This Requi&s;ite then
I perform by the help of two Tele&s;copes, &s;o plac'd at the Truckles as there|by
to &s;ee through both of them the &s;ame Point which is propos'd for the &s;aid
Center, and, by thus directing o them to &s;uch a Center, to &s;et the Truckles
in their due po&s;ture, &s;o as to de&s;cribe by their motion any part of &s;uch a Cir|cle
as &s;hall be de&s;ir'd, who&s;e Center &s;hall be the point of the Pole or Spindle
mention'd. The qualification of the In&s;trument nece&s;&s;ary for this Effect are,
Fir&s;t, That the Centers of the Truckles be exactly equi-di&s;tant from the
Center of the Compa&s;s; that is, that the Arms of the Compa&s;s be of
equal length. Secondly, That the plains of the edges of the Truckles do
exactly inter&s;ect in the Center of the Compa&s;s. Thirdly, That the two Te|le&s;cope
Sights be exactly Perpendicular to tho&s;e two Plains at two Points, as
near as may be over the Centers of the Truckles.</P>
<P>This will be more plain by a delineation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 12. Fig. 3.</NOTE> where ab, ad are the two Tele|&s;copes
directed to the inacce&s;&s;ible Center E. c, c the two Truckles plac'd at
right Angles to the Tele&s;copes. cd, cd, two Rulers jointed at the Center
d, b b a Ruler upon which the two Tele&s;copes &s;lide, &s;o as to be fixt upon oc|ca&s;ion

<Q>An Extract out of the <HI>Pari&s;ian</HI> Academies, Memoires relating to the al|teration
of the Axis of the Earths motion, Read to the R. S. <HI>July</HI> the
third 1695.</Q>
<P>As there are &s;ome Inventions that are the Products of De&s;ign and Ratioci|nation,
&s;uch as are acquir'd by the u&s;e of known Principles by the way of
rea&s;oning, Application or Contrivance; &s;o there are others found out by meer
chance upon Trials made for other purpo&s;es, as Gun-powder, the Magnetical
Vertue, Tele&s;copes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But there is al&s;o a third &s;ort of Inventions which may
be a&s;crib'd partly to the one, partly to the other, partly to De&s;ign and
Ratiocination, and partly also to Chance and Ob&s;ervation: Of this kind was
that of the cau&s;e of the Caele&s;tial motions and of the Spheroidical form of the
Earth; of which I have long &s;ince di&s;cours'd, as al&s;o of the Parallax of the
fixt Stars, and likewi&s;e of the alteration of the Poles of the Earths diurnal
motion. Now tho' this Doctrine has hitherto met with great oppo&s;ition on
the one Hand and contempt on the other, becau&s;e the later part of the in|vention
has not been compleated by &s;ome lucky chance to prove it po&s;itively,
by finding out &s;ome in&s;tances among the many Ob&s;ervations that are record|ed
that might put it beyond di&s;pute, nor by hitting upon a <HI>medium,</HI> by which
that might be verify'd in a &s;hort time; which, according to the known me|thods
of Ob&s;ervations, require a very long one, yet I hope that a little time
will produce &s;ome &s;uch proof as will put it out of doubt; and if that does
not &s;ucceed according to my expectation, yet I hope I &s;hall in &s;ome little
time be able to &s;hew a way how to effect it. I am not di&s;pleas'd that Mon|&s;ieur
<HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> thinks it worth his inquiry, and I am apt to believe is con&s;cious
of the truth of it, and that he begins to think of expedients how to &s;olve
the Phaenomena when they &s;hall be certainly found to concur with this Hy|pothe&s;is,
if he be not already convinc'd of it, and to be able to loo&s;e the in|venter
of it by finding a great number of old pretenders to it. 'Tis true
that many have mention'd &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion, and have indeavour'd to prove it,
but they &s;eem to have grounded their Conjectures only upon experiments or
Ob&s;ervations made at &s;everal times in the &s;ame place, but not upon the The|ory
of the cau&s;es of &s;uch a variation, whereas my Conjectures concerning it
were deduc'd from a Theory, which I conceive may be con&s;onant to the pro|ce&s;&s;es
of Nature; I know, indeed, that 'tis a very difficult matter to find out
&s;uch a Theory, and almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to make it &s;o evident as the Principles
of Geometry; for that the Nature, Compo&s;ition, and internal Operations
and Powers of mixt Bodies are far beyond the reach of the Sen&s;es; nor will
<PB N="537" REF="516">
the Analogy hold between the motion of gro&s;s and &s;en&s;ible Bodies and tho&s;e
of minute and in&s;en&s;ible, as can plainly enough be prov'd.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The u&s;e of The|ories.</NOTE> And upon that
account the <HI>Data,</HI> upon which the Ratiocination is founded, being uncertain
and only conjectural, the Conclu&s;ions or Deductions therefrom can at be&s;t,
be no other than probable; but &s;till they become more and more probable,
as the Con&s;equences deduc'd from them appear upon examinations by Trials
and de&s;ign'd Ob&s;ervations to be confirm'd by Fact or Effect. So that the
Effect is that which consummates the demon&s;tration of the Invention it&s;elf;
and the Theory is only an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to direct &s;uch an Inqui&s;ition, and by what
means to procure the demon&s;tration of the Exi&s;tence or non-exi&s;tence there|of.
Thus by my Theory I was led to believe that the body of <HI>Jupiter</HI> had a
motion upon its <HI>Axis,</HI> and thereupon I had a long time indeavour'd to di&s;|cover
by my &s;ight, whether it were really &s;o as I &s;uppos'd; but I could not
perceive it 'till I procur'd and made u&s;e of a very good Tele&s;cope, and there
was a Concurrence of a due po&s;ition of the permanent Spot in <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and
a clearne&s;s of the Air, and po&s;&s;ibly of my Eyes that a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in the Ob&s;er|vation;
however therefore, tho' the Ob&s;ervation were the Demon&s;tration,
yet the Theory was the occa&s;ion of &s;eeking after it: And the &s;ame was that
di&s;covery of the Parallax of the Earth, and of the Caele&s;tial Motions, which
I have mention'd in my Di&s;cour&s;e, Printed on that Subject. Now, tho' I do
not find that any have given them&s;elves the trouble to repeat the Experi|ments
and Ob&s;ervations nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e; and tho' I think there
is no one that can find a real Objection again&s;t the way and method of ve|rifying
it, which I made u&s;e of, yet there have not been wanting divers who
have &s;o far taken notice of it as to &s;ugge&s;t other ways of doing it, tho', I
conceive, much more trouble&s;ome, and abundantly more liable to Objection
than that which I contriv'd. But let every one take his own method (for
there may be many, but I believe it will be hard to find a better or &s;o good)
provided they do actually make the di&s;covery of the reality thereof; and I
am very apt to believe that the &s;ame has been verify'd in <HI>France</HI> and el&s;ewhere
al&s;o by my way, tho' they &s;eem unwilling to own it, and have not publi&s;h'd the
Fact; and that po&s;&s;ibly may be, becau&s;e they (that have made it) are un|willing
to be thought to learn from others; and becau&s;e I fear they cannot
find another way of their own that will be &s;o good as mine. And this I am
inclin'd to think from a late Di&s;cour&s;e Publi&s;h'd in the <HI>Memoires of the Pari&s;ian
Academy</HI> and el&s;ewhere, by which they would have it be believ'd, that the
Well in the Ob&s;ervatory of <HI>Paris</HI> was made for that purpo&s;e before the pub|lication
of my attempt, tho' 'twas two Years after I had made tho&s;e Ob&s;erva|tions,
and read them to the Royal Society; and that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> has
purpo&s;ely made Ob&s;ervations of the Latitudes of Places to find whether
they do alter or not, and that thereupon he had detected &s;uch a variation of
the height of the Polar Star, which might &s;erve to make him the di&s;coverer
of the annual Parallax. The mode of the whole Di&s;cour&s;e is &s;omewhat
&s;ingular, which I have therefore extracted, to &s;new what methods are us'd by
&s;ome to rai&s;e Arguments again&s;t a truth they are unwilling to have known;
and the rather, becau&s;e it is al&s;o &s;omewhat a kin to Di&s;cour&s;es for the &s;ame
purpo&s;e of our own <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufacture.</P>
<P>&startq;The irregularity of the Sea&s;ons of &s;ome late Years, and the frequent
<HI>Earthquakes</HI> which have happen'd in divers places has made &s;ome &s;u&s;pect a
change in the <HI>oeconomy</HI> of the World, and there have been &s;ome A&s;trono|mers
who believ'd that there has been of late &s;ome con&s;iderable changes
of the height of the Pole. Mon. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> having been con&s;ulted on this affair
from divers places, has computed the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of the Heavens,
with the Ob&s;ervations he has made for above thirty Years, as al&s;o with
tho&s;e of the mo&s;t antient A&s;tronomers, to &s;ee not only whether there has
been any change of late, but even for many pa&s;t Ages.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Antients took great care to compare the parts of the Heaven with
tho&s;e of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alteration of the Latitude of places.</NOTE> ob&s;erving the Circles of the Heavens which corre|&s;ponded
with the Mountains, Promontorys, and other notable parts of
the Earth; and from time to time took notice whether the&s;e did alter:
'Twas not long before they found &s;ome. <HI>Erato&s;thenes</HI> about two Thou&s;and
<PB N="538" REF="517">
Years &s;ince found by preceding Charts (as <HI>Strabo</HI> relates) that the Moun|tains
plac'd on the Ea&s;t part of the Continent, had chang'd their Site,
declining more to the North, as had al&s;o the <HI>Indies.</HI> He corrects tho&s;e,
and by a new Chart draws a parallel pa&s;&s;ing between <HI>Hercules</HI>'s <HI>Pillers,</HI> thro'e,
the <HI>Streights</HI> of <HI>Sicily,</HI> over the South extreams of <HI>Pelopone&s;us,</HI> and con|tinu'd
through <HI>Cilicia</HI> to the Gulph of <HI>I&s;&s;us,</HI> and from thence to the <HI>Indies,</HI>
over the Mountain <HI>Taurus</HI> parting <HI>A&s;ia</HI> into the North and South. The&s;e
in <HI>Ptolomy</HI>'s time, four hundred Years after, had changed places, <HI>Taurus</HI>
lying three Degrees more North than the <HI>Streights</HI> of <HI>Hercules.</HI> But if
the heights of the Pole in <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> now 1550 Years &s;ince, were exact,
the Poles are gone back and are come to the places where <HI>Erato &s;thenes</HI> found
them, <HI>Taurus</HI> and the <HI>Streights</HI> being both plac'd at 36&deg;, but this parallel
runs two Degrees South of <HI>Sicily;</HI> and indeed the mo&s;t part of the heights
the Pole, ob&s;erv'd by the Antients, differ very much from tho&s;e found at
pre&s;ent. If any could be rely'd on, tho&s;e &s;hould be at <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> and <HI>Byzan|tium;</HI>
the one made by <HI>Pytheas,</HI> and the other by <HI>Hipparchus,</HI> two of the
mo&s;t famous Ob&s;ervators of their times. The&s;e were made by <HI>Gnom$$,</HI>
of great height, and at the Summer <HI>Sol&s;tice,</HI> well circum&s;tantiated, and
with all the exactne&s;s A&s;tronomy was then able to effect. Now if the&s;e
were exact, 'tis certain great alterations have happen'd &s;ince the times of
<HI>Hipparchus;</HI> for <HI>Hipparchus</HI> found <HI>Byzantium</HI> in the parallel <HI>Pyth$$s</HI> had plac|ed
<HI>Mar&s;eilles;</HI> yet <HI>Strabo,</HI> who liv'd 150 Years after <HI>Hippara$$us,</HI> affirms
<HI>Byzantium</HI> to be more North than <HI>Mar&s;eilles:</HI> For the Para$lel that pa&s;t
through the <HI>Streights,</HI> was only 3&deg;, 34$, South of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> but from <HI>Bi|zantium</HI>
it was remov'd &s;even whole Degrees. The Oriental A&s;tronomers,
who liv'd divers Ages after <HI>Strabo,</HI> make <HI>Byzantium</HI> two Degrees mote
North than it was in <HI>Hipparchus</HI>'s times, as is plain by the Tables of <HI>Na&s;&s;er
Edd$r.</HI>&punc; and Vlug <HI>Beg.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>&startq;But in this Age on the clean contrary, <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> is two whole Degrees
more North than <HI>Bizantium;</HI> for <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> going on purpo&s;e to <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> in
1672, found the Latitude of it 43, 17. and <HI>De&s;chales</HI> at <HI>Byzantium</HI> ob&s;erv'd
its Latitude only 41&deg;. 6$. which agrees al&s;o with the Ob&s;ervations of Fa|ther
<HI>Be&s;nier,</HI> from all which, if &s;uppos'd true, there mu&s;t have happen'd
great changes.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The difference al&s;o between the Latitudes of divers places recorded by
<HI>Ptol$my,</HI> and tho&s;e ob&s;erv'd in the &s;ame places by other A&s;tronomers, &s;ince
may be argument enough for our Beleif, that the Pole has chang'd much
&s;ince the time of <HI>Ptolomy.</HI> This difference appear'd &s;o convincing to <HI>Do|minick
Mari$</HI> of <HI>Ferrara</HI> (a Man of an excellent <HI>Genius</HI> as <HI>Maginus,</HI> affirms,
and who was Tutor to <HI>Copern$cus</HI>) that he a&s;&s;erted that the height of the
Pole did continually change, and that places now in the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> would,
in proce&s;s of time, come into the Frigid and the contrary; and that the
Mountains of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> now roa&s;ted by the Sun, would in time be co|vered
by Snow and Ice. <HI>Maginus</HI> al&s;o, and the A&s;tronomers of his time,
affirm the Poles al&s;o to have changed. And <HI>Ticho</HI> was &s;o far mov'd by this
Opinion, that he de&s;ir'd the State of <HI>Venice</HI> to &s;end an able A&s;tronomer
on purpo&s;e to &s;ee, if the pre&s;ent Latitude of <HI>Alexandria</HI> were the &s;ame that
<HI>Ptolomy</HI> had found it; but this without effect; however tis expected from
&s;ome, &s;ince &s;ent for that purpo&s;e by the <HI>French</HI> King. 'Tis true, the ex|actne&s;s
of anfient Ob&s;ervations was not to be compar'd to the Modern,
and therefore no more &s;hall be &s;aid on that head at pre&s;ent.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But next to come to Ob&s;ervations le&s;s to be &s;u&s;pected, as made
this la&s;t Age. <HI>Rothman</HI> a&s;&s;ures <HI>T$$ho</HI> by a Letter, that he had found a dif|ference
of the height of the Pole of a Minute or two, between the Win|ter
and Summer of the &s;ame Year. <HI>Snellius</HI> and <HI>Ricciolus,</HI> who are both a|gain&s;t
this Opinion, do yet report Ob&s;ervations that confirm it, as that
<HI>Ticho</HI> ob&s;erv'd the Latitude once 50&deg;. 6'. another time 50&deg;. 4'. 30'. &s;uch are
the Latitudes of <HI>Paris</HI> found by &s;everal Men, 48. 39'. [48. 45.] 48. 50. and
&s;ome 48. 55. Great differences are al&s;o found of the Latitude of the &s;ame
place taken at different times by <HI>Riccioli</HI> and <HI>Grimaldi</HI> with the greate&s;t ex|actne&s;s.
<HI>Grimaldi,</HI> in 1645, finds the Tower of <HI>Modena</HI> in 44&deg;. 37'. ex|actly,
<PB N="539" REF="518">
and the &s;ame <HI>Grimaldi</HI> with <HI>Riccioli</HI> in 1654, finds it 44. 38'. 50'. the
&s;ame found a place on the Mountain of <HI>Bolonia</HI> 44&deg;. 27'. and the &s;ame
place another time 44. 27'. 50'. The &s;ame in 1646, found his Ob&s;ervatory
in <HI>Bolonia</HI> 44&deg;. 29'. 30'. but in 1655, he, with <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini,</HI> found it 44&deg;. 30'. 20'.
the &s;ame &s;ays, <HI>Ferrara</HI> was once ob&s;erv'd 44&deg;. 50'. another time 44&deg;. 51'.
7'. and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> another time &s;ince, by repeated Ob&s;ervations, found it 44&deg;.
52'. In the Year fifty &s;ix <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> found the Palace of <HI>Farne&s;i</HI> in <HI>Rome</HI> 41&deg;.
52$. but in &s;ixty eight he found the Palace of <HI>Cardinal d'E&s;te</HI> (which &s;hould
have been more) only 41&deg;. 51'. At <HI>Paris</HI> 1668. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> and <HI>Picart</HI> found the
height of the Pole-&s;tar at the Kings Library 48. 53. and by that the height
of the Ob&s;ervatory mu&s;t have been 48&deg;. 51'. 10'. two Years after when
the Ob&s;ervatory was fini&s;h'd, <HI>i. e.</HI> in <HI>September</HI> 71. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> finds it 51&deg;. 19'.
40'. and the twelfth of <HI>October</HI> following 51&deg;. 19'. 50'. and the eighth of
<HI>September</HI> 51&deg;. 19'. 10'. <HI>Picart</HI> at <HI>Vraniberg</HI> 1671. on the eighth of <HI>Octo|ber</HI>
finds the greatest height of the Pole-&s;tar 58&deg;. 23'. 15'. but in <HI>November</HI>
he finds it 58&deg;. 22'. 55'. and in <HI>December</HI> 58&deg;. 22'. 45'. He adds other in|&s;tances
of his own and other Ob&s;ervations too long to repeat at this time,
by which he &s;eems to prove a change of the Latitude of Places, or the
height of the Pole even at the Ob&s;ervatory of <HI>Paris.</HI> But after all he pro|ceeds thus&mdash;&endq;.</P>
<P>&startq;Notwithstanding all the&s;e Ob&s;ervations of apparent variations, it may
be &s;aid only, that in the&s;e later times there has happen'd no extraordi|nary
change either in the height of the Pole or Meridian Altitudes of the
Sun; but al&s;o that the Heavens have at all times kept the &s;ame Po&s;ition
to the Earth that they have at this pre&s;ent Age; &s;ince it may be believ'd
that all tho&s;e variations, of which I have &s;poken, may have proceeded from
Defects in the Ob&s;ervations: As, Fir&s;t, From the defaults of In&s;tru|ments,
&s;ince it is certain that In&s;truments do &s;uffer alterations from time
to time, the cau&s;es of which are imperceptible, which is the cau&s;e why
they are &s;ometimes examin'd and corrected. Secondly, From the difficulty
of di&s;tingui&s;hing the parts of a Minute. Thirdly, From the differing
Refraction of the Air, e&s;pecially at the Ob&s;ervatory of <HI>Paris,</HI> being on the
South &s;ide of &s;o great a City. Fourthly, As there is a variation of the
direction of the Magnetical Needle, &s;o there may happen &s;ome change of
the direction of the Perpendiculars of In&s;truments, and the&s;e changes may
be more &s;en$$ble in &s;ome places than in others. La&s;tly, As to the Ob&s;erva|tions,
of the&s;e the Antients were made with very cour&s;e In&s;truments, they
had no regard of Refraction or Parallax or other Circum&s;tances that might
cau&s;e Errors, and thence we need not wonder at &s;uch con&s;iderable differences
among them, be&s;ides the mi&s;takes of Numerical Figures by the Tran&s;cribers;
&s;o that maki$$ allowances for all the&s;e, there will remain little difference of
Po&s;ition of the Heavens to the Earth, or the motions of the Stars to be
rely'd on, and it is more rea&s;onable to a&s;cribe tho&s;e that are found to the&s;e
accidents than to a change in the Heavens.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And yet it is mo&s;t probable that there is &s;ome &s;mall variation of the
height of the Pole which happens from time to time, but that never ex|ceeds
two Minutes, and it will be &s;ettled in time. This is very remark|able
in the height of the Pole of <HI>Alexandria.;</HI> for <HI>Ptolomy</HI> with all his
care found it &s;ometimes 30$. 58'. at other times 31&deg;; &s;o tho' there be a
little change, yet this mu&s;t not pa&s;s as extraordinary, &s;ince it exceeds not
two Minutes. The difference between tho&s;e of <HI>Ticho</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Picart,</HI>
in 71 and 72. is but 50. in 88 Years; and we mu&s;t con&s;ider that this is
not in proportion, &s;ince we have found a greater change in one and the
&s;ame place in one Year. For twenty two Years now &s;ince the Ob&s;ervatory
has been built, <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> has found but two variations: This variation the
&s;aid <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> has attempted to reduce to &s;ome Rule; he fancies the Altitudes
of the Poles dimini&s;h as the Sun approaches the Aequinoctials and Sol&s;tices,
and increa&s;e as it departs from them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> al&s;o believes there is &s;ome change in the Sol&s;titial Altitudes,
and has actually found them, but tho&s;e not &s;o great as tho&s;e of the Pole;
and the&s;e variations he conceives, will in time &s;ettle al&s;o. We have al|ready
<PB N="540" REF="519">
&s;een, that tho&s;e of <HI>Pythias</HI> made at <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> three hundred Years
before Chri&s;t, and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI>'s in 1672. differ but &s;ome Minutes, and we may
&s;hortly expect, whether tho&s;e &s;ent by the. King on purpo&s;e to <HI>Alexandria,</HI>
will find any difference from <HI>Ptolomy</HI>'s Soli&s;titial Altitudes.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is of great importance in A&s;tronomy to know to what preci&s;ene&s;s the
height of the Pole can be found; for if we cannot with all our care, be &s;ure
of it within half a Minute, 'tis in vain to make u&s;e of it for finding the
Parallax of Planets above the Moon, or for &s;etling the hour of the Sol|&s;tice,
where &s;ome few Seconds are con&s;iderable; but indeed for <HI>Geogra|phy,
Navigation,</HI> or <HI>Chorography,</HI> this is curious enough&endq;.</P>
<P>What the de&s;ign of this long Di&s;cour&s;e of Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> may be I cannot ga|ther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Authors Reflections.</NOTE>
unle&s;s it be to &s;eem to deny the variation of the Altitude of the Pole,
becau&s;e po&s;&s;ibly he is oblig'd &s;o to do, and yet at the &s;ame time exactly prove
it; or by a new way to &s;olve the annual Parallax of the fixt Stars; which he
&s;eems to grant, but yet 'tis by a new fancy of his own, for which I can con|ceive
no rea&s;on. Me thought Mon&s;ieur <HI>Comiers</HI> was much more conceiv|able,
tho' extravagant enough, that every Star mov'd in a little Epicicle o$
a Minute in Diameter, once round in a Year. Next I cannot but wonder to
find him at the &s;ame time relying on Ob&s;ervations of the Antients to prove
what he would have to be &s;o and rejecting as far (and be&s;pattering indeed all)
that are not for him; an ea&s;y way to prove or di&s;pove any thing. Thirdly, I
ob&s;erve, that tho' what I had formerly, &s;poken of the alteration of the Center
of the Gravitation of the Earth, were look'd upon as a very extravagant and
improbable Opinion, yet I conceive it is not &s;o e&s;teem'd by the <HI>Pari&s;ian Aca|demians;</HI>
otherwi&s;e it would not have been Printed. I am al&s;o now apt to
&s;u&s;pect that <HI>Ticho Brahe</HI> did <HI>doulein Hypothe&s;ei;</HI> &s;ince, by <HI>Rothman</HI>'s, he was
advertis'd of &s;uch an annual Phaenomenon or Change, and that he might
ea&s;ily have &s;atisfy'd him&s;elf by his own Ob&s;ervations, without &s;ending to <HI>Ae|gypt</HI>
for information. To conclude, as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> conceives the&s;e lit|tle
variations or &s;wayings of the Poles and Sol&s;tices will, in &s;ome &s;hort time,
&s;ettle and fix in their true places; &s;o I conceive that all the&s;e &s;truglings to
make it this or that, &s;omewhat or nothing, more or le&s;s, will at la&s;t termi|nate
in that Explication thereof, which I have long &s;ince propounded.</P>

has been lately found by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Picart</HI> and others, to vary 18'. to|wards
the Ea&s;t from that fixed by <HI>Ticho Brahe</HI> above a hundred Years &s;ince;
and the <HI>Pyramid</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> has been found newly to &s;tand in a po&s;ture that

tho&s;e other alterations, &s;uppos'd to be found, are to be a&s;crib'd to the de|fects
of the Ob&s;ervations them&s;elves. In the next place he relates the fir&s;t
occa&s;ion of making a Meridian Line in this Church of St. <HI>Petronio,</HI> to be for
rectifying the time of <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> and the Fea&s;ts of the Church which depend on
the true time of the Vernal Aequinox. Now the Prelates of <HI>Alexandria</HI>
(who were deputed by the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> to &s;tate that time) found it then to
be on the twenty fir&s;t of <HI>March;</HI> but Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> being inform'd, that it,
in this time, fell on the eleventh of that Month; he alter'd the <HI>Julian Ac|count,</HI>
and made the eleventh to be the twenty fir&s;t. This was the occa&s;ion
of <HI>Ignatio Dante</HI>'s fir&s;t making a Meridian Line in the Pavement of that
Church in the Year 1575, before this alteration which was in 1683; but this
Line being found to vary from the pre&s;ent Meridian, and to be &s;erviceable
only for ob&s;erving the Sol&s;tices, and being &s;u&s;pected to be &s;o mi&s;placed by
rea&s;on of the ob&s;truction of the Pillars of that Church was the occa&s;ion of
Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI>'s finding a fitter place, and fixing there his new Meridian
Line in the Year 1655. the place where, and manner how he more parti|cularly
and fully expre&s;&s;es, becau&s;e it was of &s;o con&s;iderable, and, as it
were, of &s;acred u&s;e to the Church: He names all the eminent A&s;tronomers
who were his Concomitants in the Operations, as witne&s;&s;es of the exactne&s;s
of it. After this he relates &s;everal variations that have happen'd to that
Fabrick &s;ince he fir&s;t fixed this Line, and thereby &s;hews the nece&s;&s;ity and u&s;e
of the Re&s;tauration, and adju&s;ting it for the time to come, by which any
further alteration that may happen to that Building for the future, may be
&s;o far remedied, and the e&s;&s;ential parts of this Line &s;o far re&s;tor'd and recti|fy'd,
that they &s;hall be as effectual as if no alteration had happen'd. The
u&s;es of which will be not only to &s;hew the true time of the Suns ingro&s;s into

intent they not only caus'd the In&s;truments made u&s;e of in the fixing this

Ruler and Compa&s;&s;es, by drawing a &s;traight Line cro&s;s the Projection with
black Lead, pa&s;&s;ing through two of them that were ob&s;erv'd in one Azymuth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I do not re|member$ have &s;$$n the Le$$$ $span$</NOTE>
and then laying the Ruler over the other two that were ob&s;erv'd in the o|ther
Azymuth, and noting the Point where the &s;aid Ruler &s;hall cut the for|mer
Line drawn with black Lead upon the Projection; for that That Point
of Inter&s;ection will repre&s;ent the true Point of the Heavens then in the
Zenith of the place where &s;uch Ob&s;ervation &s;hall be made. Now by finding
the true di&s;tance of that Point of Inter&s;ection either from the Polar Point,
if it be comprehended in the Projection, or from the Aequinoctial Circle, if
that be comprehended, it will not be difficult to find the true Latitude of
the place; and, if it be de&s;ir'd, the Po&s;itions of tho&s;e Azymuths and the
hour of the Night, and the true Meridian Line, and the like, which would
be too long to explain and exemplify at this time and place.</P>
<P>The former of the&s;e two kinds of Ob&s;ervations may al&s;o be perform'd by
the plani&s;pherical Projections, or the half Tangent Projections, where the
Polar Points are made the Center of the Projections more ea&s;ily, or &s;ome|what
more difficultly where any other Point of the Sphere is made the Cen|ter
of the Projection; which is performed by drawing great Circles upon the
&s;aid Projections with black Lead which &s;hall pa&s;s through each of the two
Stars ob&s;erv'd in the one and the other Azymuth or Perpendicular; for
that the Point of Inter&s;ection of the two great Circles thus drawn, will
&s;hew, upon the &s;aid Projection, the true Zenith Point of the place, who&s;e
di&s;tance from the Polar Point of the &s;aid Projection (which is ea&s;ily mea&s;ur|able)
will give the Complement of the Latitude of the place. The greate&s;t
difficulty in this way, is the drawing of a great Circle upon the Projection,
which &s;hall pa&s;s though the two Stars ob&s;erv'd in the &s;ame Azymuth or
Perpendicular. But this, as it may be perform'd divers ways, &s;ome more
ea&s;y, &s;ome a little more difficult, &s;ome of which are Printed, and others
may if occa&s;ion require; &s;o I think none &s;o difficult, but that an ordinary
Capacity may, in a &s;hort &s;pace, be inform'd how to effect and perform the
&s;ame with accuratene&s;s enough. But the explaining the&s;e ways would be
too long for this pre&s;ent Meeting.</P>
<P><PB N="544" REF="523">
As for the &s;econd &s;ort of Ob&s;ervations, wherein the two Azymuths are
ob&s;erv'd at two differing times; that is, the &s;econd Ob&s;ervation of any two
noted Stars in &s;ome Azymuth is taken, &s;ome known or mea&s;ur'd &s;pace of
time after the fir&s;t hath been taken notice of: The&s;e may be made al&s;o
&s;erviceable for the finding not only the Latitude of the place, but al&s;o of all
the other <HI>Po&s;tulata</HI> mention'd to be found by the former way, but with &s;ome|what
more of Operation, and that not only by the Projections of the Sphere
made according to the Tangents, but al&s;o by tho&s;e of the &s;ame made by
the half Tangents of di&s;tance from the Central Point thereof: And both
the&s;e may be divers ways effected upon the &s;aid Projections; but the mo&s;t
ea&s;y, and that which is accommodated to both the&s;e kinds of Projections,
is by &s;uppo&s;ing that part of the Heavens to &s;tand &s;till, wherein the
fir&s;t Ob&s;ervation was made, whil&s;t the re&s;t of the Heavens have pa&s;s'd on
their u&s;ual progre&s;s proportion'd to the interval of Time between the fir&s;t
and &s;econd Ob&s;ervation; for by that means the two Azymuth-Circles both
pa&s;&s;ing through the Zenith of the place, both the &s;traight Lines repre&s;ent|ing
them in the Tangent Projection cro&s;s each other in the Zenith Point, or
in a Point as far di&s;tant from the Pole of the Projection, as the Zenith of
the place is from the true Pole in the Heavens; and al&s;o the Circles in
the half Tangent Projection repre&s;enting tho&s;e great Circles of Azymuths
will cro&s;s each other in the Zenith Point at the later Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>To make this the more intelligible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 12. Fig. $.</NOTE> let <HI>R r, S s</HI> repre&s;ent four notable
Stars truly plac'd in a Tangent Projection of a large part of the Northern
Hemi&s;phere, who&s;e Polar or Central Point let P repre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Let <HI>R r,</HI> by Ob&s;ervation, be found to be in the &s;ame Azymuth or Per|pendicular
one above the other at &s;ome time of the Night; lay a Rule over
tho&s;e two Stars in the Projection, and draw the Line FA <HI>r R;</HI> this Line
therefore mu&s;t repre&s;ent the &s;aid Azymuth Line or great Circle in which is
the Zenith-Point at the time of Ob&s;ervation; which Zenith-Point we are
yet to &s;eek and find out, becau&s;e the great Circle that pa&s;&s;eth through the
other two Stars <HI>s S,</HI> doth not cro&s;s the former now in the Zenith-point,
but in &s;ome other Point, as A at an unknown di&s;tance from it; but by watch|ing
them they are found by &s;ome good Time-keeper, as a Pendulum-watch,
or the like, to mea&s;ure the Time, and a convenient In&s;trument to find,
when they are in &s;ome one and the &s;ame Perpendicular, at two Hours after
the fir&s;t Ob&s;ervation, to be in one Azymuth Line. Now, tho' not before, a
&s;traight Line drawn through them, repre&s;enting a great Circle, will al&s;o
be a true Azymuth Circle, and will pa&s;s through the Zenith-point of the
place at the time of the later Ob&s;ervation. Let a, n, g, repre&s;ent the An|gle
made at the Pole by the Heavens moving We&s;tward in the &s;pace of two
Hours, <HI>viz.</HI> thirty Degrees. Suppo&s;e then the Azymuth Circle fir&s;t taken,
<HI>viz.</HI> FA <HI>r R</HI> to &s;tand &s;till, and all the re&s;t of the Heavens or the two Stars
<HI>S s</HI> to be mov'd forwards or We&s;twards thirty Degrees, and <HI>S s</HI> be now at
S s, draw the &s;traight Line through them, <HI>viz.</HI> b S s, cutting the other FA
<HI>R r,</HI> not in A as at the time of the fir&s;t Ob&s;ervation, but, at Z, I &s;ay; this
Point of Inter&s;ection Z, &s;hall repre&s;ent the true Zenith-Point of the place,
both in the fir&s;t and la&s;t Ob&s;ervation; for APB is made equal to a n g, de|noting
the interpos'd time, and P b s S is made equal to the Angle PA <HI>s S,</HI>
which &s;hews their re&s;pects to the Pole in the later and fir&s;t Ob&s;ervation.
Now <HI>FAR</HI> and b s S both pa&s;&s;ing through the Zenith, there can be no other
Point in them to repre&s;ent the &s;ame, but where they cro&s;s each other, <HI>viz.</HI>
Z. Z therefore is the true Zenith Point, and its di&s;tance from the Polar Point
P being mea&s;ur'd upon the Projection, will give the Complement of the
Latitude of the place.</P>
<P>The &s;ame thing may be perform'd upon the half-Tangent Projection, and
with more convenience, by rea&s;on of its great Capacity, and the le&s;s ine|quality
of divi&s;ions: It hath only one Operation &s;omewhat more difficult
than the other, and that is the drawing great Circles through the &s;aid Stars
in&s;tead of &s;traight Lines in the preceding way; but in all things el&s;e the
Method and Demon&s;tration is the &s;ame with that, and the Point of Inter|&s;ection
<PB N="545" REF="524">
of the fixt Azymuth, and remov'd Azymuth is the Zenith-Point of
the place.</P>
<P>Now the ways of drawing a projected great Circle which &s;hall pa&s;s thro'
two Points given of this kind of Projection, being many, and mo&s;t of them
ea&s;y enough; I conceive this method of finding the Latitude of places may
be of very good u&s;e for Navigation, e&s;pecially at &s;uch times, as, by rea&s;on
of Foggs or other Impediments (as the unknown declination of the place)
Altitudes cannot be &s;o well ob&s;erv'd or made u&s;e of at Sea.</P>
<P>But for the finding the exact Latitude of places upon the Land where
great In&s;truments may be us'd, I have other methods, not depending upon
the &s;uppos'd true placing of the Stars, whereby that inquiry may be an|&s;wer'd
to what accuratene&s;s &s;hall be de&s;ir'd, which will be of very good u&s;e
for that other que&s;tion which I have propounded; that is, whether the La|titude
of places alter and vary upon the Earth in proce&s;s of time; and &s;ince,
if there &s;hould be any &s;uch, the variation is but &s;mall, and therefore very &s;low,
and the unaccuratene&s;s po&s;&s;ibly of former Ob&s;ervations cannot much be de|pended
upon; I conceive that by tho&s;e ways it may be po&s;&s;ible to re&s;olve
that in a very few Years, which, by the commonly known methods, cannot
be expected in le&s;s than &s;ome Ages, which is the be&s;t way of redeeming
Time by making the be&s;t u&s;e of what we have yet to come.</P>
<Q>This Lecture, and the following, treat of the inequality of the Earths Mo|tion,
and of the methods of ob&s;erving and examining it.</Q>
<P><HI>May</HI> 25. 1687. It has been no &s;mall di&s;couragement to my progre&s;s in
explicating &s;ome Phaenomena of Nature by &s;ome new Hypothe&s;es, to find
that they have been mi&s;repre&s;ented, or at lea&s;t mi&s;under&s;tood or mi&s;con&s;tru'd;
mi&s;repre&s;ented I mean, when, Fir&s;t, I have been &s;aid to a&s;&s;ert that ab&s;olute|ly
and po&s;itively, which I only propounded as an Hypothe&s;is, or as Queries
to be further examin'd by Rea&s;on, Experiments and Ob&s;ervations. And,
Secondly, When I have been repre&s;ented, as affirming things which I never
did nor could have done with coherency to the Hypothe&s;is; as that the
Earth hath been many times, be&s;ides in <HI>Noah</HI>'s Flood, all cover'd with Wa|ter
and dry'd again: Mi&s;under&s;tood I mean, when the Arguments I pro|duc'd
were not rightly con&s;ider'd and duly weighed, and that it &s;eem'd indif|ferent
to the Examiners to conceive of the matter as I had argued for it, or
the quite contrary: As to conceive that the Figure of the Earth may be ei|ther
a prolated Sphaeroeid, or an oblong Sphaeroeid, or neither of the&s;e.
Mi&s;con&s;trued I mean, when that which I propounded for one end and u&s;e, is
wre&s;ted to quite another; as because I had doubted of the &s;ufficiency and cer|tainty
of the A&s;tronomical Ob&s;ervations for this purpo&s;e, only for determin|ing
whether the true Latitude of places, or their true Meridian Lines, had
varied, therefore I am repre&s;ented as calling in que&s;tion all Hi&s;tory, both
Divine and Humane. The&s;e kinds of proceeding might have been expected
from a provoked Adver&s;ary; but why they come, whence they they do, I
know no rea&s;on. However, by the Sequel I doubt not but that even tho&s;e
who &s;hew the mo&s;t prejudice, will make it evident by the benefit and u&s;e
they make of them, that there was no rea&s;on for &s;uch kind of treatment;
nor &s;hall it deter me from proceding to propound &s;ome other Conjectures;
which, whether rightly propounded or not, I &s;hall leave to further examina|tions
by Experiments and Ob&s;ervations, as I did the former; all I de&s;ire
is a fair trial; let the Te&s;timonies of Nature it&s;elf be examin'd, and their
Evidence not wre&s;ted nor bafled.</P>
<P>The thing I &s;hall at pre&s;ent propound,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of an inequali|ty of the Earths diurnal moti|on</NOTE> is what I hinted in my attempt to
prove the motion of the Earth. <HI>Page</HI> the 27, <HI>Line</HI> the 31, 32, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I did
there hint, that I had then, in &s;ome of the foregoing Ob&s;ervations there
mention'd, di&s;cover'd &s;ome new motions even in the Earth it&s;elf, which
perhaps were not thought of before; one of which was this which follows,
which whether it were a&s;cribable to this or any other cau&s;e, I will not con|tend;
let trials more accurate and curious than po&s;&s;ibly tho&s;e fir&s;t were may
determine it; I propounded it only as a query for examination. It is eighteen
<PB N="546" REF="525">
Years &s;ince I made the Ob&s;ervations, and they were made by a Clock which
went three Years without winding up more than once, which was the fir&s;t
of that kind, where the weight of the Pendulum was very near as big as the
weight that kept it going for &s;o long a time; whether the cau&s;e of the ine|quality
were to be a&s;crib'd to the Clock, or the Earth, or &s;ome other un|heeded
Circum&s;tance, I will not now contend; yet I did, with what care I
then could, con&s;ider of all I could think of, and upon the whole conceived
them to be a&s;cribable to &s;ome inequality in the motion of the Earth; but
let further trials determine it.</P>
<P>I conceiv'd then that there was &s;ome inequality in the diurnal Revolution of
the Earth, not &s;uch a one as <HI>Kepler</HI> &s;uppo&s;eth, only of the Earth turning quicker
when nearer the Sun, and flower when further from it, but an inequality in
every Revolution; that is, that in one part of the Revolution it was &s;low|er,
in another &s;omewhat quicker; which, whether to a&s;cribe it to the power
of the Sun, or that of the Moon, or both, let farther examination deter|mine;
for there may po&s;&s;ibly be cau&s;es, why both of them may effect it in its
diurnal Revolution. I do therefore propound as Queries, whether there
may not be in the Body of the Earth &s;ome parts which, tho' as to the gravi|tating
powers of the Earth, may be duly &s;ituated and poi&s;ed for its equal
Revolution upon its Axis, yet with re&s;pect to the gravitating Power of the
Sun or Moon may not be counterpois'd, but be over ballanc'd on one &s;ide of
its Axis.</P>
<P>I know that if the gravitating Power in the Sun and Moon be exactly the
&s;ame with that of the Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That there may be a difference in the $in$s of $span$ in $span$.</NOTE> the Query I propounded can have no ground;
but tho' they may in mo&s;t particulars be con&s;onant, as I &s;hall prove in my
Theory of Gravity&punc; yet there may be a cau&s;e (and there &s;eems to be &s;ome
a&s;&s;ignable) why there may be &s;omething Specifick in each of them, of that
kind Which I now propo&s;e, as may be po&s;&s;ibly conceiv'd from the Moons Li|bration,
of its turning or keeping pretty near the &s;ame &s;ide of its Body to
the Surface of the Earth. For tho' the &s;uppo&s;ing it to turn upon its Axis in
re&s;pect of the Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Moon $$ting and $$itution of $word$ Body.</NOTE> &s;o as to make a Revolution I&s;ocrone to its Synodick Re|volution
about the Earth, be an ingenious Hypothe&s;is; yet the Phy&s;ical Rea|&s;on
of &s;uch an equality &s;eems pretty difficult to be conceiv'd, unle&s;s, we &s;up|po&s;e
&s;ome cau&s;e from the Con&s;titution of the Body of the Moon it&s;elf, which
makes one part of it gravitate more towards the Center of the Earth than
another in &s;uch a Revolution. And if &s;uch there be (as I &s;ee yet no clear
rea&s;on to the contrary) then mu&s;t&punc; the unequal progre&s;&s;es of the Moon pro|duce a
kind of Vibrating, Librating, or Pendulous motion thereof; &s;o that
the equal motion &s;uppos'd will be blended or compounded with a Pendulous
motion of that part towards the Center of the Earth. I will not pre&s;ume
to a$$ign what cau&s;e may be in the Body of the Moon; whether one &s;ide
of its body next the Earth be more de$&s;e and &s;olid, and the oppo&s;ite more
porous and $$$gy, or whether the one be con&s;tituted of Bodies more heavy
in Specie tha$ th$ other, as that tho&s;e parts which re&s;pect the Earth, &s;hould
be more of the Nature of Earth, Stone, Rocks or Minerals, and the oppo|&s;ite&punc;
of Waters, Seas, Atmo&s;phere, Air, of &s;omewhat anologous to them;
which &s;ome appearances do &s;eem to favour, and &s;ome others pu$po&s;ely and
de&s;ignedly contain'd and perform'd, may give us further information of&punc;
$word$ upon the whole it &s;eems to me there is a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome &s;uch &s;uppo&s;i|tion
to &s;olve the Phaenom$na hitherto taken notice of; and there may be a
$word$ of &s;ome other &s;uppo&s;itions to &s;olve &s;ome other Phaenomena which
I &s;hall on another occa&s;ion mention. As to &s;uppo&s;e that the Body of the
Moon, tho' it be Sphaerical as to its Circumference which happ$$$ in the Full
and Now Moon, $word$ Be$clip&s;es of the Sun, when view'd from the Earth, yet
that its Body may be in that Diameter of it which re&s;pects the Earth much
longer than in any other Diameter; that is, it may be of an oblong oval
$word$ who&s;e longe&s;t Diameter re&s;pects the Earth; who&s;e Centers of Gra|vity
tho' they are in the Axis, are yet not in the middle thereof, but nearer
towards the Earth. Now if there be &s;uch a diver&s;ty of the Body of the
$span$ to the Earth, why may there not be &s;ome &s;uch in the Bo|dy
$span$ re&s;pect to the Sun, $ay tho it have a Revolution upon
<PB N="547" REF="526">
its own Axis?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the cau&s;e of the inequality of the Earths diurnal motion.</NOTE> For &s;uppo&s;ing the Earth &s;u&s;pended on its Axis of motion, if any
one part of that with re&s;pect to the Gravitation towards the Sun do more than
over-ballance the part oppo&s;ite to it on the other &s;ide (tho' as to the Gravity
to the Earth they are ballanced) them mu&s;t that part have a tendency to|wards
the Center of the Sun, if at any time it be remov'd out of that Po&s;i|tion;
and that tendency mu&s;t be Analogous to that of a &s;ingle Pendulum (here
&s;u&s;pended) towards the Center of the Earth; &s;o that when the motion of
Rotation is carrying it towards its lowe&s;t or direct Point, that power mu&s;t
accelerate that motion, and when it hath pa&s;s'd that Point, and is beyond
it, that power mu&s;t retard it according to the Degrees or Proportions by
which a vibrating Pendulum is accelerated, when mov$d towards the Perpen|dicular,
and retarded when mov'd from it; and this Acceleration and Re|tardation
mu&s;t intermix and blend it&s;elf with the equal Circular motion, and
Accelerate it in one part, and Retard it in another part of its Revolution;
as will be more conceivable by the Experiment I &s;hall by and by &s;hew with a
Wheel who&s;e Axis lies Horizontal, and one of who&s;e &s;ides is &s;omewhat heavier
than the other. Now, as I Conjecture or Query, whether there be not
&s;ome &s;uch Principle acting with re&s;pect to the Sun; &s;o I do &s;omewhat farther
query whether there be not &s;ome &s;uch Anomaly with re&s;pect to the Moon,
between which and the Earth there &s;eems to be a much nearer kindred and
affinity than between that of the Earth and of the Sun; and po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome|what
of the Phaenomena of the change of the Sea by Titles and Currents, and
of the Air by Winds or Motions thereof may be found to be influenc'd by
&s;uch a Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>What ever the event may be upon a &s;trict examination by Experiments, I
conceive it will not be unacceptable, &s;ince it will be a truth in Phy&s;ick a&s;cer|tain'd,
which will influence many other; and I know no other way of trying
it, than by that which gave me the fir&s;t hint of it, which was the ob&s;erving
the Velocities of &s;everal Stars at &s;everal times of the Night in their pa&s;&s;ing
by the Zenith, by comparing the &s;everal Arches they make in a certain &s;pace
of time with one another, and with the time exactly kept by a curious Pen|dulum
Clock; for if we find that &s;everal Stars plac'd in or very near the
parallel of Declination which pa&s;&s;eth over the Zenith in &s;everal parts there|of
do all of them pa&s;s a certain Arch thereof when they tran&s;it the Zenith
in the &s;ame &s;pace of time exactly, then we may conclude that the d&igrave;urnal Ro|tation
is euqal and $word$ in a whole Revolution; but if it &s;hall be found
that &s;ome of them pa&s;s an equal Arch in a longer, &s;ome in a &s;horter time;
(which was the Phaenomena I took notice of) them it will be further requi&s;ite
to pro&s;ecute &s;uch other Ob&s;ervations as may determine the Rea&s;ons and
Cau&s;es thereof, and farther Light will follow from it whatever way the Ex|periment
&s;hall determine it, provided they be carefully and accurately made
with accurate Clocks, and with In&s;truments fitted with Tele&s;cope Sights.</P>
<P>Now becau&s;e the things to be ob&s;erv'd, which are nece&s;&s;ary to compleat
the Ob&s;ervation, are only two, namely, Fir&s;t, The length of an Arch
mov'd by a Caele&s;tial Body&punc; And, Secondly, the time wherein that Body
that moves &s;uch a determinate Arch; therefore I have contriv'd two In|&s;truments of &s;ufficient accuratene&s;s in their re&s;pective kinds for performing the&s;e
Ob&s;ervations; and they are, Fir&s;t, A Tele&s;cope for the Sights of the fir&s;t
In&s;trument for determining the parts of the parallel Circle, or Circle of De|clination
in which the Caele&s;tial Body moves. And, Secondly, A Pendulum
to mea&s;ure and divide the time, during which the Body doth $tually move
&s;uch an Arch.</P>
<P>As for the fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$ for the Ob&s;er|vation.</NOTE> namely, the Tele&s;cope, I have already &s;ufficiently de|&s;crib'd
it in my Di&s;cour&s;e of a way for accurately finding the Meridian Line
and the Axis of the Earth, and therefore I &s;hall not here need to repeat it.
<HI>Vide.</HI> p. 358. <HI>Supra.</HI></P>
<P>But for the &s;econd becau&s;e of the curio&s;ity of the Ob&s;ervation to be made
by it, I &s;hall be &s;omewhat more particular in its d$&s;cription.</P>
<P>There are then three &s;orts of Pendulums,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pendulum for the Ob&s;er|vation.</NOTE> which may be &s;o adapted, $word$
that, by the help of them, the time between the tran&s;its of a Star over two
Meridians, at ten, twelve or fifteen Degrees di&s;tance may be mea&s;ur'd to the
<PB N="548" REF="527">
fifteenth part of a &s;econd of time, if by the u&s;e of the Tele&s;cope Sight there be
occa&s;ion for &s;o great exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>The contrivance of them all con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e particulars; Fir&s;t, That they
all move during the whole interpos'd &s;pace by the fir&s;t impre&s;s'd force when
they are fir&s;t put into motion, without any addition of new force to continue
their motion, and by that means all irregularity, caus'd by the Wheel|work,
is avoided.</P>
<P>Secondly, That they are all made with very heavy Weights, and of the
mo&s;t proper Shapes for pa&s;&s;ing through the Air, &s;o that they receive very
little Impediment from it, and much le&s;s of Irregular$ty by rea&s;on all extra|neous
motion of the Air is kept off by the ca&s;e in which they are included.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That their decrea&s;e of motion is regular and certain; &s;o that
tho' their extream Excur&s;ions do approach nearer the Center or Perpendi|cular,
yet that being always done in the fame proportion, the &s;ame number
of Vibrations will always be made in the &s;ame quantity of time; that is,
how many Vibrations, and what part over doth mea&s;ure the time of an hour
at one time, &s;o many and &s;uch part will mea&s;ure the time of an hour at any
other time, whether of the fame Day or Night, or at times di&s;tant more
than a Day.</P>
<P>Fourthly, For that the motion of them is &s;o adju&s;ted, that be the Vibra|tions
greater or le&s;s, they &s;hall be all i&s;ocrone and of equal duration.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That the time of the motion through the whole length of one ex|cur&s;ion,
whether longer or &s;horter, &s;hall be actually divided into equal parts
by unequal divi&s;ions, but proportion'd &s;o as to an&s;wer exactly to the given
Proportions or Divi&s;ions of time.</P>
<P>Sixthly, That they are all &s;o contriv'd, that the ob&s;erver &s;hall be able to
mark the very moment of the la&s;t Tran&s;it him&s;elf, and the fame of the fir&s;t
Tran&s;it by the help of an a&s;&s;i&s;tant; and this to as &s;mall a time as a humane
Moment, or as quick as Thought: So that he &s;hall be able certainly to know
in what point or part of the excur&s;ion, the weight of the Pendulum is in,
when the Star is ob&s;erv'd to be in the Zenith or Meridian of the place, or
in any other Meridian where the Stars there appearing does terminate and
fini&s;h the &s;econd Tran&s;it, or the end of the time to be ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>This contrivance con&s;i&s;ts in two parts, Fir&s;t, To let go, or &s;et in going,
the Pendulum by a touch of the Finger at the very moment of the fir&s;t: Tran|&s;it
of the Star to be ob&s;erv'd, which hath this al&s;o of convenience or per|fection
rather, that the Pendulum is always &s;et in going, or beginning with
the &s;ame Arch of De&s;cent, and not at an uncertain heighth. Secondly,
That with the like touch of the Finger at the moment of the &s;econd or la&s;t
Tran&s;it, there is a part of the Instrument that marks the very point of the
whole excur&s;ion, through which the Center of the moving Pendulum is at
that moment pa&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>It may be perform'd with three &s;orts of Pendulums, namely, the Circular, the
Slope and the common Perpendicular Pendulum; each have their advantages
wherein they exceed the other two, and each their di&s;advantages wherein
they are exceeded by them; but upon ballancing the whole three I do mo&s;t
approve of the la&s;t before either of the other, for the &s;implicity of its make
and thence its exactness and certainty of going; its Regularity in not loo&s;ing
its power and motion, but by Degrees very &s;low, which bear a proportion to
the number of Vibrations, and the regularity of its motion as to the divid|ing
the Excur&s;ions into parts an&s;wering to equal Moments or Spaces, and
the ea&s;ine&s;s for letting go and al&s;o for taking notice of the la&s;t moment; all
which particulars I &s;hall more particularly explain in the Module I &s;hall pro|duce,
which will much more intelligibly expre&s;s it than a Draught or
Scheme.</P>
<P>WHat this Module was I never knew, but the ingenuous will ea&s;ily apprehend
the contrivance and meaning of the Author without any Scheme, by con&s;i|dering
the following Paragraph; therefore I have not thought fit to trouble the Rea|der
with a Conjectaral Draught of my own.</P>

<P>As to the divi&s;ions of the parts of an Excur&s;ion, the whole length of the
Excur&s;ion on each &s;ide of the Perpendicular Point is to be made as the Ra|dius
of a Circle of that length, and to be divided into a Line of Sines an&s;|wering
to &s;uch Divi&s;ions of an Arch of a Circle, an&s;wering thereto, as &s;hall
be convenient for the Divi&s;ion of the time of an Excur&s;ion; as if the whole
Excur&s;ion be perform'd in a Second of Time; then for Thirds the Semicir|cle

<P><HI>Wen&s;day June</HI> 25. 1687. I &s;hew'd here, at the la&s;t Meeting, one &s;ort of In|&s;trument
for the mea&s;uring and dividing the parts of time to as great an ac|curatene&s;s,
as I conceive, 'tis po&s;&s;ible to be done by any kind of Mechanical
Invention what&s;oever; for that it is capable of dividing and mea&s;uring it,
not only to the accuratene&s;s of the Thoughts of a Man, but, if need re|quire,
even to Moments that are &s;horter &s;ome hundred times than humane
Moments. What I mean by humane Moments, I have formerly, in &s;ome of
the&s;e my Cutlerian Lectures explain'd to this Honourahle Auditory; and be|cau&s;e
I find that &s;ometimes the repetition of former Experiments and Ob&s;er|vations
are not ungrateful to &s;ome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At the end of the Lectures of Light.</NOTE> I &s;hall now again &s;hew that the Thoughts
of a Man move or change in a limited &s;pace of Time; not &s;o quick but that
&s;uch moments are yet divi&s;ible into moments infinitely &s;maller or &s;horter of
duration, and thence that each humane moment is capable of Division into
any definite Number of Parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Minute divi&s;ions of Time.</NOTE> how many &s;oever &s;hall be a&s;&s;ign'd; as if the
humane moments be as &s;mall as a third Minute of Time, which yet, I con|ceive,
very few are able to di&s;tingui&s;h by their Thoughts, yet that Third of
Time containeth &s;ixty Fourth Minutes, and each Fourth containeth &s;ixty
Fifths, and each fifth containeth &s;ixty Sixth Minutes of Time, and &s;o on|wards,
which we find A&s;tronomers will take notice of, and account for in
their Computations of equable Divi&s;ions, tho' they are in them&s;elves but very
&s;mall and altogether in&s;en&s;ible parts or one humane moment: I &s;ay in&s;en|&s;ible,
by rea&s;on that they are quicker than the Thought of a Man can di|&s;tingui&s;h
a Prior from a Po&s;terior moment: For who is there that can di|&s;tingui&s;h
the 3600 part of the Time of a Second, which yet is but a fourth
minute of Time? Much le&s;s will any one be able to di&s;tingui&s;h the 216000
part, which is a fifth or a 12960000 part thereof, which is a &s;ixth, and yet
we mu&s;t acknowledge that &s;uch parts there really are included in every Se|cond
minute of Time, tho' never &s;o much &s;maller or &s;horter in duration than
a humane moment, and that they really have their Power and Effect in na|tural
motions and alterations proportionable to &s;uch their duration, and are
mea&s;urable or conceivable there, tho' they are &s;o much quicker than our
Thoughts and Abilities to di&s;tingui&s;h one from another: For if we take for
a round Number that a Semidiameter of the Earth be four thou&s;and Miles,
and thence find that the Circumference under the Aequinoctial Line be 25132
Miles, and 7412287183459, 10000000000000, which is 01290888208650
of a Mile in a Second of Time; or to omit the accuratene&s;s of the Fracti|ons
and to keep to round Numbers, which, in this ca&s;e, &s;erve better where
the Matter and De&s;ign aim'd at is but Illu&s;tration, and to help Concepti|on,
let us conceive that a part of the Earth, under the Aequinoctial, mov|ing
in a Second of Time an 86400 part of that Circumference of the Earth;
which, to keep &s;till to round Numbers, we may conceive to be near 1/10 of a
Mile, of 6000 Foot to each Mile; then will each part of the Earth there
move every Second of Time 1800 Foot, and in every Third of Time thirty
Foot, and in every Fourth of Time &s;ix Inches, and in every Fifth of Time
1/10 of an Inch. Now, tho' the Conception of this part of Time be really im|po&s;&s;ible,
otherwi&s;e than by Proportion and Analogy to the &s;en&s;ible parts, yet
the motion of Nature doth really mea&s;ure it, and its progre&s;&s;es are adaequate
to &s;uch moments, and each fifth Minute of Time the part hath mov'd a
tenth of an Inch forward into another place, in re&s;pect of its Po&s;ition to the
<PB N="550" REF="529">
Heavens, or to the parts of Space con&s;ider'd as immovable: And the pro|gresses
of progre&s;&s;ive or local motion being &s;uppos'd equal or commen&s;urate
to the moments of Time (how &s;mall &s;oever) the Body mu&s;t move in every
&s;ixth Minute of Time, a &s;ix hundred part of an Inch forward; which length
our Sen&s;es can reach and di&s;tingui&s;h, tho' it cannot the minim of Time,
which is not &s;o to be magnify'd.</P>
<P>This Speculation I have been the more large upon, to &s;hew that there may
be a u&s;e of this In&s;trument for di&s;tingui&s;hing and numbering the parts of
Time, which are abundantly much le&s;s than a humane Moment; which, tho'
not di&s;tingui&s;hable by our Thoughts, yet have their effects, in Nature, and,
in many Experiments, are very con&s;iderable and pertinent to be taken no|tice
of; as I &s;hew'd by many Experiments try'd before this Society above
twenty Years &s;ince, by an In&s;trument &s;omewhat like this, for the mea&s;ur|ing
the times of falling Bodies, which po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome here pre&s;ent may well
remember.</P>
<P>Tho', I &s;ay, the&s;e &s;mall moments of Time are not di&s;tingui&s;hable by a
Man's Thought, yet by many Mechanical Contrivances they can be made
di&s;tingui&s;hable, and thereby they can be made u&s;eful in multitudes of Phy&s;i|cal
and Philo&s;ophical Inquiries, and even in this, which gave the occa&s;ion of
the mentioning of it; namely, the mea&s;uring of the exact time that any
Star that &s;hall be ob&s;erv'd, is moving from any one Po&s;ition to any other; and
that even to a &s;horteror le&s;&s;er time than that of one third Minute of an Hour,
which, if the motion of the Star be in, or near, a great Circle, is about a
quarter of a Second of a Degree. The way of effecting which, is the mak|ing
the Tele&s;cope to move along with the Star, and when the Star is come
to a certain point, and con&s;equently the Tele&s;cope that follows it, then doth
that Tele&s;cope let go the Pendulum, and &s;et it going with a certain degree
of Velocity; and again, the &s;ame Tele&s;cope being kept moving along with
the Star, at lea&s;t, &s;ome &s;mall time before it arrive at the &s;econd &s;tation;
then doth it, in its motion, let go the Stopper, or Stay of the Pendulum,
or Index thereof, ju&s;t at the very moment as the Star is pa&s;&s;ing the Point
of the &s;econd Station; which denotes the preci&s;e moment of &s;uch Touch or
Tran&s;it. Now, tho' this be abundantly more quick than Thought, and &s;o,
cannot be perform'd &s;o nicely by the motion of the Finger, yet by this means
I &s;peak of, where the Tele&s;cope is kept in motion with the Star, which is
ea&s;ily enough perform'd, as I have often had Experience, the moments, tho'
exceeding &s;mall, will yet be numbred thereby. To this I could add the de|&s;cription
of a &s;econd In&s;trument, which is made with a Pendulum al&s;o, but
moving Circularly &s;u&s;pended by a round Steel Wire, and is to be let go, and
to be &s;tay'd in the &s;ame manner, by means of the motion of a Tele&s;cope,
which follows the motion of the Star; in which In&s;trument the circulating
motion of the Pendoulus Weight doth de&s;cribe a Spiral Line, which, by e|qual
Angles from the Center, is divided into equal Spaces of Time, and
thereby the number of the Spaces in that Spiral, pa&s;t by the Pendulum be|tween
the two Tran&s;its of the Star, being computed, do give the exact num|ber
of third Minutes of Time that have pa&s;s between the two Ob&s;ervati|ons;
but this In&s;trument being &s;omewhat more complicated than the former,
and that being &s;ufficiently accurate for &s;uch trials, I &s;hall omit the further de|&s;cription
thereof at this time.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e I under&s;tood that the Demon&s;tration I read of the true way
of dividing the Arch of its motion, into parts of equal duration, or of e|qual
Time, was not &s;o fully comprehended by &s;ome then pre&s;ent, which was
this I now read;</P>
<P>Therefore for a more full Demon&s;tration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The&s;e Schemes are l$&s;t.</NOTE> and particular Explication there|of,
I have drawn &s;ome Schemes, by the explaining of which I doubt not to
make it evident, in every particular thereof, to any one that &s;hall doubt of
any part thereof, whereby the truth and certainty thereof will more plainly
appear.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 29. 1687. I &s;pent &s;ome time in my la&s;t Lecture upon the con&s;idera|tion
of &s;en&s;ible Time, and of the equal Divi&s;ion and Men&s;uration thereof;
for which purpo&s;e I explain'd two In&s;truments, the mo&s;t exact that have been
<PB N="551" REF="530">
thought of, far exceeding, as I conceive, any that have been yet publickly
known, and capable of performing, or of helping to perform, &s;uch Ob&s;er|vations
of Caele&s;tial Bodies as no I&s;trument, yet made u&s;e of, has perform'd;
at lea&s;t, not the bell that I had ever heard of; &s;ome In&s;tances of which I
&s;hall &s;hortly acquaint you with; for tho' our Methodi&s;ts have made compleat
Sy&s;tems of Sciences, yet, when they come to be a little more nicely &s;urvey'd
by a doubting Examinant, many of tho&s;e Maxims, that are &s;o Dogmatically
and Po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted, will be found not altogether &s;o Congrous to the truth
of Nature as they have hitherto been believ'd; and tho&s;e none of the lea&s;t
Con&s;iderable and Fundamental.</P>
<P>I could carry this Mechani&s;m yet further, by &s;hewing &s;ome In&s;truments
by which to mea&s;ure the parts of in&s;en&s;ible moments; I mean &s;uch moments
as a Man cannot di&s;tingui&s;h by his Thoughts into a preceding and &s;ub&s;e|quent
moment, or is able to number or di&s;tingui&s;h one from another by his
Eye or Ear, far le&s;s than that I call in&s;en&s;ible; not but that the Sen&s;e doth
really di&s;tingui&s;h moments, yet prodigiou&s;ly le&s;s above a thou&s;and times, nay,
ten thou&s;and times, as I &s;hall afterwards prove; but it is not under the Idea
of Time and Number, but under that of &s;ound, Tone, Harmony, and the
like; wherein how curious the Sen&s;e of Hearing is, I appeal to &s;uch as are
skilful in Mu&s;ick, who can ea&s;ily, by their Ear, tell you when the Vibrati|ons
of Mu&s;ical Strings are one as quick again as the other, that is, when Di|apa&s;ons,
when their Proportions are as 3 to 2, or as 3 to 4, or as 8 to 9,
that is, as a Diapente or Fifth, that is, a Diate&s;&s;eron or Fourth, that is, a whole
Note or Tone, and the like, and when they are of &s;uch or &s;uch a determi|nate
Tone, as <HI>Gam ut, A re, B mj,</HI> and the like, which they di&s;tingui&s;h, I
&s;ay, by the Ear, or the Sen&s;e of Hearing, tho' not under the &s;ame Idea or
Phantom as they do when the Vibrations are &s;o &s;low as to be &s;ingly di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd
one from another, but under the Idea of Sound; which, when the
Vibrations are I&s;ocrone, as I have formerly here prov'd tho&s;e of &s;trained or
extended Strings to be, which act upon the principle of Spring; as al&s;o Bells
or &s;ounding Metals, and the Vibrations of the Air, which depend al&s;o upon
the Spring and Power or Recolle, they are Mu&s;ical Sounds; but when they
are not I&s;ocrone they are not Mu&s;ical. In the&s;e ca&s;es the Sen&s;e runs a &s;tep
higher and brings us into another Region, where we find another pro&s;pect
of Time, and the Partitions thereof far differing from that of the fir&s;t and
inferior Region, wherein we di&s;tingui&s;h the parts of Time by Monades or
Unites; for in this we di&s;tingui&s;h them by Aggregates, Bodies, Bulks,
Armies, Thou&s;ands, and the like great Numbers, not con&s;idering them
&s;ingly, but together; for this purpo&s;e I &s;hall hereafter produce &s;ome Me|chanical
Contrivances, by which the&s;e quick motions and minims of Time
may be reduc'd to Number and Computation, which I conceive ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary in all Philo&s;ophical or Physical Experiments; but I &s;hall not now
digre&s;s into Experiments of that kind, but proceed in that method which I
have begun, to &s;hew the u&s;e of this In&s;trument I have already de&s;crib'd, and
&s;hewn the Module thereof, by explaining how the &s;ame may be of u&s;e for
finding the Latitude of a Place without the incumbrance of Refraction, at
lea&s;t by &s;uch a way as is the lea&s;t of any I have yet known di&s;cover'd by any,
in Print, or any other ways.</P>
<P>This method I de&s;cribe in order to the pro&s;ecution of that Inquiry which I
lately propos'd of examining, whether the Axis of the diurnal Rotation of
the Earth did, or doth change its Po&s;ition in re&s;pect of the parts of the
Earth; that is, whether the Latitudes of Places do, in proce&s;s of time, va|ry
as well as the Meridian Line; for if the &s;aid Axis doth vary, one of the&s;e
two ways, or both, will be &s;ufficient to di&s;cover it in any part of the Earth
what&s;oever; for if &s;uch motion of the Axis as I have propounded &s;hall hap|pen
to move in the Meridian Line of the place where the Ob&s;ervation of the
Meridian, for that purpo&s;e, &s;hall be made; then, tho' no &s;uch variation of
the Meridian Line can be, by that means, ob&s;erv'd, there being none, yet
this way for examining the Latitude of the Place will &s;oon detect it. Again,
if that motion &s;hould happen to be at right Angles to the Meridian of the
Place, then this way would be ineffectual, and the former way of finding
<PB N="552" REF="531">
the true Po&s;ition of the Meridian Line, with re&s;pect to the known parts of
the Horizon, would perform it; and in ca&s;e its motion be any other way in|clin'd
to the Meridian, then the comparing of both the&s;e two ways together
will &s;tate and determine it, as it doth al&s;o in both the preceding Ca&s;es, be|cau&s;e
it determines which way and how much in all.</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary therefore that the way of finding the Latitude of a place
&s;hould be as accurate and as little liable to Objections,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 358. &s;upra &amp; alibi.</NOTE> as the way I have al|ready
&s;hewn of finding the Meridian Line; which I conceive is the mo&s;t ex|act
that has been hitherto di&s;cover'd, and may be as ea&s;ily made, and is &s;uf|ficient
to perform what is requi&s;ite in the Inquiry propos'd.</P>
<P>The method then for finding the Latitude of a Place, is by finding out the
true Zenith-Point of the Place where the Ob&s;ervation is to be made; how
to do this I have el&s;ewhere &s;hewn, and therefore &s;hall not need here to re|peat
it: This may be done to what accuratene&s;s &s;hall be de&s;ir'd; for that
longer and longer Tele&s;copes may be made u&s;e of for the determination
thereof; and it is not difficult to procure Object-gla&s;&s;es of any length de|&s;ir'd,
accurate enough for performing &s;uch Ob&s;ervations: Having deter|min'd
that, I ob&s;erve what Stars pa&s;s over the Zenith-Point, or pretty near
it, who&s;e di&s;tance from that Point, in the Meridian, I can accurately mea|&s;ure;
then the following Night I ob&s;erve that Star, I pitch upon, an Hour,
or an Hour and half, or &s;ome certain time before it come to the Zenith,
marking exactly the Point where I &s;o ob&s;erve it at the time I let go my Pen|dulum
or Time-keeper, and mea&s;uring exactly the Angle that Ray maketh
with the Perpendicular, finding al&s;o, if I plea&s;e, the po&s;ition the Plain thro'
tho&s;e two Lines hath to the Plain of the Meridian; tho' that may be omit|ted,
when it is only us'd for finding the Latitude: Then I compute the Time
exactly that pa&s;&s;es between &s;uch and &s;uch Ob&s;ervations, and the time it pa&s;|&s;eth
the Zenith or Meridian; and at an equal time, after &s;uch Tran&s;it, I a|gain
ob&s;erve it on the other &s;ide of the Meridian, and find the Point or the
Angle that Ray al&s;o maketh. From the compari&s;on of which two 'tis evi|dent,
that the Declination of that Star is certainly determin'd, and con&s;e|quently
that the Latitude of the place, where &s;uch Ob&s;ervation is made, is
al&s;o given. Now the rea&s;on why I ob&s;erve it on both &s;ides of the Meridian
is this, becau&s;e I thereby almo&s;t wholly avoid the Refraction of the
Air, and yet mea&s;ure a large Arch; for that the Refraction of the
Air is hardly &s;en&s;ible even to Tele&s;copes of &s;o great a length, as may
be made u&s;e of for this Ob&s;ervation, when the di&s;tance from the Zenith
is not greater than what is requi&s;ite to determine this Inquiry, to what
accuratene&s;s almo&s;t &s;hall be required, and the Ob&s;ervation on both &s;ides
doubling the Angle at the Zenith, or the Arch of the Parallel, when it is
only made on one &s;ide, the Refraction, what it is, is &s;till made more in&s;en|&s;ible
when an equal &s;ubten&s;e of an Arch of the &s;aid Parallel is obtain'd by Ob|&s;ervation
on both &s;ides, that when on one &s;ide only. This way of finding
the Latitude of a Place, I did, at the &s;ame time, formerly acquaint this So|ciety
with, tho' not &s;o particular, when I told them al&s;o the way of making
u&s;e of the Stars in the Perpendicular for finding the difference of Parallels
for mea&s;uring a Degree upon the Earth; but this part of the Contrivance I
do not find that the <HI>French</HI> have made any u&s;e of in their Ob&s;ervation of a
Degree, tho' they have of the other; po&s;&s;ibly it might be, that he that ac|quainted
them with the one, did not &s;o well comprehend the other, and the
rather too, becau&s;e the Invention of the mea&s;uring and determining the &s;mall
parts of time was not at the &s;ame time de&s;crib'd, but &s;ome of them before,
and &s;ome of them afterwards upon &s;ome other occa&s;ions; as that of the di|rect
<HI>Pendulum</HI> upon the occa&s;ion of the Experiments of falling Bodies, and
that of the Circular Pendulum aequated by its motion in a Parabolical Cono|eidal

&s;uitable and proper method to attain the end; &s;o, 'till better methods be
prov'd, it ought not to be alter'd and laid a&s;ide. The De&s;ign was for pro|moting
the Growth and Increa&s;e, and Vegetation, as I may &s;o call it, of
Natural Philo&s;ophy from the fir&s;t Seed or Embrio through all the Ages and
Increa&s;ings of it, 'till it attain to a State of Perfection of Flowering and
Blooming, and of producing Seed, and become Fruitful; for Natural Know|ledge
may not unfitly be compar'd to a Vegetable, whether Plant or Tree,
which &s;prings from a Seed &s;ow'd in a Soil, proper and adapted, by a skillful
Gardener, for that Plant. For as the Seed, by &s;mall Fibrills or Roots it &s;hoots
out, receives, from the Soil or Earth, a nouri&s;hment proper and adapted for
a&s;cending into the Body or Stalk, to make it grow in bulk and &s;trength to
&s;hoot upward, and from thence to &s;hoot forth Branches, and from them
Leaves, thereby to draw and receive out of the Air a more refin'd, &s;piri|tuous
and inlivening Juice, which de&s;cending back into the Body or Stock,
increa&s;es its Stature, Bulk, Circumference and Strength by new incirclings,
and thereby inables it to &s;end forth more Fibrills and greater Roots, which
afford greater and more plentiful Supplies to the Stock or Trunk, and in|ables
that to exert and &s;hoot forth more Branchings, and greater numbers
of Leaves; which, repeating all the Effects and Operations by continu'd and
con&s;tant Circulations, at length bring the Plant to its full Stature and Per|fection:
Nor will a skillful Gardener &s;uffer it to be tapp'd to have the nutri|tive
and vital Juice drawn off to be us'd for other purpo&s;es than the nutriti|on
of its own Body; well knowing it would hinder its Growth, prolong the
time of its coming to Maturity, weaken its Con&s;titution at lea&s;t, if not
render it wholly barren.</P>
<P>So Natural Knowledge doth receive its fir&s;t informations from the &s;upplies
afforded by Select and proper <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature convey'd by the Sen&s;es;
the&s;e improve the Under&s;tanding and inable it to rai&s;e &s;ome Branchings out
into Conclu&s;ions, Corollarys and Maxims; the&s;e afford a nutritive and &s;trength|ening
Power to the Under&s;tanding, and inable it to put forth new Roots of In|qui&s;itions,
Trials, Ob&s;ervations and Experiments, and thereby to draw new
&s;upplies of Informations; which further &s;trengthening the Under&s;tanding, $n|able
it to exert and produce new Deductions and new Axioms: The&s;e cir|culate
and de&s;cend downwards, increa&s;ing and &s;trengthening the Judgment,
and thereby inable it to make more &s;triking out of Roots of Inquiries and Expe|riments,
which cau&s;e the like Effects as before, but more powerfully, and &s;o
by con&s;ent and continu'd Circulations from <HI>Phoenomena</HI> to make <HI>Deductions,</HI>
and from <HI>Deductions</HI> to inquire <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> it brings the Under&s;tanding to a
compleat and perfect comprehen&s;ion of the Matter at fir&s;t propos'd to be con|&s;ider'd;
nor mu&s;t the Natural Cour&s;e or Circulation be &s;topp'd or diverted,
'till the utmo&s;t Perfection be attain'd, if at lea&s;t it be aim'd to compleat and
make it prolifique.</P>

It was a Conclu&s;ion by &s;ome &s;uch method as this produc'd by me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the differ|ence of Gravi|tation.</NOTE> and
made known to this Society near thirty Years &s;ince, that the <HI>Gravity</HI> of the
Earth was differing in differing Latitudes, and that it was greater under the
Poles than under the <HI>Aequator,</HI> and the nearer to the Poles the greater;
and the nearer the <HI>Aequator</HI> the le&s;s. This I fir&s;t propounded to this Society
upon the occa&s;ion of the trials of the <HI>Pendulum</HI>-Clocks carry'd at Sea; and a|gain,
upon the occa&s;ion of the <HI>Pendulum</HI> apply'd for a Standard Mea&s;ure of
length, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But as things new and Heterodox to the Opinions in Vogue,
it met with a check, and &s;o the further pro&s;ecution of it could not proceed,
I have many times &s;ince again repeated the Sugge&s;tion, &s;ometimes upon one,
&s;ometimes upon other occa&s;ions, but, as Extravagancies, they have been
pa&s;s'd over; the la&s;t time I repeated it Dr. <HI>Wallis</HI> wrote a long Epi&s;tle to
confound it, but Mr. <HI>Newton,</HI> it &s;eems, upon examining it, found &s;ome rea|&s;on
for it, and &s;ends up (a Fortnight after Dr. <HI>Wallis</HI>) his con&s;iderations up|on
it, con&s;onant to what I had demon&s;trated to the Society: This made it
begin to be taken notice of, and to be thought worth examining; however
many other Doctrines that were deduc'd from as evident premi&s;es have been
&s;uffer'd to lie by, in expectation of a better opportunity, which I hope Time
may afford; which, when I meet with, I &s;hall not be unmindful of laying
hold of; and I much rejoice at this which I have now met with of Captain
<HI>Knox</HI> his Voyage to <HI>India,</HI> who has promis'd to be very ob&s;ervant of it, and
to keep an account thereof; and in pur&s;uance of the Order of this Society,
I have got a Pendulum Watch fitted for that purpo&s;e, which I now pro|duce.</P>
<P>There is yet another Inquiry which will, if accurately tried with fit In&s;tru|ments,
afford great and u&s;eful Information, both for u&s;e at Land, and al&s;o
for the Sea and Navigation; and that is to find the Po&s;ture and Gravitation
of the Air. This I propounded to the Society as a thing very well worth
Trial and Examination &s;ome twenty five Years &s;ince; but as the u&s;e of the
<HI>Barometer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cription of a Sea B$$ome|ter.</NOTE> even at Land, was not then heeded, tho' I had then reduc'd it to
as much of Theory for foretelling the Weather, as is is known at this Day;
&s;o the Inquiry, after the u&s;e of it at Sea, was the le&s;s regarded; and when af|terwards
the thing came to be taken notice of by means of King <HI>Charles</HI> his
ob&s;erving it to follow the Rules that were then &s;et, which was about ten
Years after, many had thoughts of having it carry'd to Sea, but attempting
it only by the common way of the Barometer, not knowing, I &s;uppo&s;e, the
way I had propos'd; the u&s;e of it at Sea was indeed impracticable, and, as
&s;uch, laid a&s;ide. I &s;hall not trouble you with a new De&s;cription, but if you
plea&s;e to afford me your Patience, I &s;hall read the De&s;cription which I then
produc'd, and it hath ever &s;ince remain'd in your Regi&s;ters.</P>
<P>The Contrivance of this In&s;trument is much the &s;ame with what I explain'd
to this Society about thirty Years &s;ince.</P>
<P>This being thus prepar'd will fully be &s;ufficient to exhibit all the varieties of
Pre&s;&s;ure in the Air; and 'tis capable of &s;hewing all tho&s;e Variations with as
great nicety and exactne&s;s as &s;hall be requir'd even upon the Sea, tho' &s;tormy
and turbulent: Nor is there any great difficulty of preparing or making u&s;e
of it; &s;ave only that, if the Gradations be requir'd to be very large, it will
require a very long Tube of Gla&s;s; and that Tube to be doubled or folded
to and fro to lie in a little room, which I have my &s;elf been able to do with
no great matter of trouble; but it would be yet much better if a very
long Tube of Gla&s;s, of forty or fifty Foot in length, were coiled round a
Cylinder, after the manner of Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Wren</HI>'s Weather-gla&s;s; which,
with &s;ome few trials, I do not que&s;tion may be effected; for that thereby it
would be ea&s;y to make the difference of Gravitation in the Air as large and
&s;en&s;ible, as it need to be de&s;ir'd; be&s;ides it will be, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' it will not in tho&s;e other Tubes, which I propo&s;e, be capable of
&s;o great an Augmentation of that difference, yet the&s;e, if well adju&s;ted,
will, I conceive, be found of great u&s;e for fore-&s;hewing the approaches of
Storms and Calms, which extreams of the motion of the Air are very unwel|come
and trouble&s;ome Concomitants at Sea. It will al&s;o give an account of
<PB N="555" REF="534">
the comparative Gravity of the Air in &s;everal Climates and Latitudes; and
thereby afford Indications, by which the Figure, Form, or Con&s;titution of
the Shell of the Air, which incompa&s;&s;es the Earth, may be judg'd of. It
will likewi&s;e &s;hew the Nature and Qualities of &s;everal Winds as to Pre&s;&s;ure,
and al&s;o as to Heat and Cold; that is, whether an Ea&s;terly Wind be every
where the heavie&s;t, and the Southern the lighte&s;t; as they are generally ob|&s;erv'd
to be in <HI>England.</HI> What Winds are hotter or Colder; that is, whe|ther
Sea-Winds or Brizes, or Land-Winds or Brizes; whether there be any
certain difference between the Pre&s;&s;ure in the Night and in the Day, as
there is con&s;tantly in the Heat and Cold; whether the Rains or the dry Sea|&s;ons
are the Hotter; and many others. And to this end it will be well to
note the &s;tate of this In&s;trument at Noon and Midnight, and in the Morn|ing
and Evening.</P>
<P><HI>Decemb.</HI> 12. 1694. The In&s;trument I mention'd the la&s;t Day, which I had
about thirty Years &s;ince invented and &s;hew'd to this Society, is, I conceive,
an Invention of &s;o great u&s;e, that if the Knowledge and Practice of making,
adju&s;ting and manner of ob&s;erving with it, be once attained, it may be a
means of &s;aving many thou&s;ands of Pounds in a Year to the Merchant, and
which is more, many hundreds of Mens Lives; and therefore I think it ought
not to be any longer neglected, but rather to be made and try'd as &s;oon as
po&s;&s;ible; and tho' we cannot as yet procure the means to make it of the mo&s;t
perfect and mo&s;t convenient form for tran&s;portation and u&s;e on Ship-board,
yet &s;ince it is ea&s;y and practicable enough to make it to &s;hew all the dif|fering
Pre&s;&s;ures of the Air as exactly as the common &s;ingle Barometer does
at Land, nay, twice as exact; I think it may be fir&s;t try'd, of the perfecte&s;t
form we can now make it, and po&s;&s;ibly that form may be mo&s;t fit for the fir&s;t
trial, &s;ince the other being more nice, may &s;o much the more perplex the
unexperienc'd Mariner, and may better be introduc'd after the practice there|of,
for the u&s;e of the Sea, hath made the Theory thereof more intelligible,
and the benefits thereof more &s;en&s;ible and evident.</P>
<P>The method and grounds of my Invention, I conceiv'd, were very plain and
obvious, as many others are after they are once di&s;cover'd and explain'd, and
&s;ome are then &s;o obvious, that even that becomes the cau&s;e why they are
&s;lighted, neglected, and not taken notice of; and po&s;&s;ibly that may have
been one Rea&s;on why it has fared &s;o with this, if being &s;o ea&s;y to be con|ceiv'd;
I did not therefore &s;pend much time in the explication thereof; but
having the la&s;t Day apprehended, by &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;es, that the Theory
thereof was not &s;o perfectly comprehended, but that there remain'd &s;ome
he&s;itancy or doubts concerning it, I have now made a &s;omewhat more parti|cular
De&s;cription of the In&s;trument it&s;elf, and of the Ground and Rea&s;on of
the contrivance thereof.</P>
<P>It is now about &s;ixty Years &s;ince the <HI>Thermometer</HI> was invented for the u&s;e
of indicating the degrees of Heat and Cold in the Air,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hi&s;tory of the Thermome|ter.</NOTE> by certain and deter|min'd
mea&s;ures, which was done by means of a bolt Head, or long necked
Gla&s;s, as they are now commonly call'd, the Ball or Head of which, and part
of the Neck, was fill'd with Air, but the Mouth or lower end was fill'd
with &s;ome colour'd Liquor, and immers'd in a &s;mall Ce&s;tern or Receptacle of
a quantity of the &s;aid Liquor; by which means the included Air, which is
rarify'd and expanded by Heat, and condens'd with Cold, did either de|pre&s;s
the &s;aid tinged Liquor into the Ce&s;tern, or draw it up higher into the
Neck, of the Gla&s;s; which property of the rarification and conden&s;ation of
the Air hath been known ever &s;ince the time of <HI>Hero,</HI> and probably long be|fore;
yet the Application of that knowledge for this u&s;e, I do not find was
put into practice or taken any notice of, 'till about the Year 1630; &s;ome
&s;hort time after which I find <HI>Robertus de Fluctibus</HI> or <HI>Flud</HI> did write a parti|cular
Treati&s;e to explain the &s;aid In&s;trument and &s;ome u&s;es of it; but <HI>Blan|canus</HI>
a&s;cribes the Invention of it to <HI>Sanctorius</HI> much about the &s;ame time;
but I will not di&s;pute which of them we ought to a&s;cribe it to; but who|ever
it were, it was an ingenious Tho$ght, and adaequate enough to the
Theory of the Expan&s;ion of the Air then under&s;tood. But Experimental
Philo&s;ophy hath &s;ince made a further di&s;covery, and &s;hew'd us that the Air
<PB N="556" REF="535">
may not only be more or le&s;s expanded by the Degrees of Heat and Cold in
the Ambient Air, but al&s;o by the alteration of the pre&s;&s;ure of the Atmo&s;|phere,
which doth le&s;s or more depre&s;s the Surface of the &s;tagnant tinged Li|quor
in the Ci&s;tern or Receptacle; &s;o that That In&s;trument, commonly call'd
a Weather-gla&s;s, is no longer a true Standard to mea&s;ure the Degree of Heat
and Cold, but &s;erves only to give us the re&s;ult of two Powers acting upon it
promi&s;cuou&s;ly; &s;ometimes with a Concurrency both tending one way, and
&s;ometimes with Contrariety and Oppo&s;ition, the one promoting the Expan|sion,
the other the Conden&s;ation thereof; if therefore we can by any means
di&s;cover the effects of the one at all times upon it, we pre&s;ently find the
Power and Effects of the other. If therefore we can by other means di&s;cover
the Effects of Heat and Cold, we &s;hall thereby di&s;cover what is to be a&s;crib'd
to the Gravity or Pre&s;&s;ure of the Air.</P>
<P>Now to do this effectually I make u&s;e of the Sealed <HI>Thermometer</HI> which was
fir&s;t invented, as I have been inform'd, by the Grand Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> and
the fir&s;t that I ever &s;aw or heard of was a &s;mall one brought into <HI>England</HI> by
our Honourable Pre&s;ident; by which I improv'd it by making &s;everal very
large, and tinged the Liquor to make it more &s;en&s;ible to the Eye. This In|&s;trument
being Hermetically &s;eal'd, and &s;o all the influence of the Pre&s;&s;ure of
the Air being excluded, the included Liquor can only be acted upon by the
Heat and Cold of the Ambient Air; &s;o that hereby at all times I am a&s;cer|tain'd
of the Degree of that quality; knowing then what the Power of that
quality is upon the Weather-gla&s;s, I can ea&s;ily &s;ee what part of the Indicati|on
is to be a&s;crib'd to the Pre&s;&s;ure or Gravity of the Air or Atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e having produc'd two convenient Gla&s;&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ method of $$king the In|&s;trument.</NOTE> the one for the
open Weather-gla&s;s, and the other for the &s;eal'd <HI>Thermometer,</HI> by a Stand|ard
<HI>Thermometer</HI> made and adju&s;ted, according to the method I have pre|&s;crib'd
in my Micrography, I adju&s;t the <HI>Thermometer,</HI> putting all the Degrees
of Heat and Cold above and below the freezing Mark where I begin my
Account, or o, and making them with &plus;1, &plus;2, &plus;3, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> above that mark; and
with &minus;1,&minus;2,&minus;3, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> below the &s;ame, I wait 'till &s;uch time as the Barometer
&s;tands at twenty nine and half Inches high, which is here in <HI>England,</HI> at lea&s;t
the &s;tandard Altitude between Fowl and Fair Weather; then putting the Balls
of both the Gla&s;&s;es into Water heated to a certain Degree, which may be
hot enough to an&s;wer to the greate&s;t Degree of heat that I conceive the Air
will &s;u&s;tain in any part of the Torrid Zone, I &s;uffer them both together to
remain in that Degree of heat, 'till the Liquor in the <HI>Thermometer,</HI> and the
Air in the Weather-gla&s;s, be reduc'd to the &s;ame Degree of heat; then I
ob&s;erve the mark'd Degree of the <HI>Thermometer,</HI> and mark the Weather-gla&s;s
with the &s;ame; then I permit the Liquor, in which the two Balls are plac'd,
to cool by degrees, and thereby ob&s;erve how the liquor in the <HI>Thermometer,</HI>
and the Air in the Weather-gla&s;s, do contract by the motion of the Liquors
in their Stems, and by the Degrees of the <HI>Thermometer,</HI> I mark the Degrees
in the Weather-gla&s;s that an&s;wer thereunto; and when the Liquor is cold, I
intend that Cold, with Niter, and Ice to procure the Divi&s;ions below the freezing
mark; by which means I find all the marks of the Weather-gla&s;s that an|&s;wer
to all the marks of the <HI>Thermometer,</HI> when the Gravity of the Air is
equiponderant to twenty nine and half: Whenever therefore the Gravity of the
Air is more or le&s;s, I &s;hall ea&s;ily di&s;cover it by the difference there is be|tween
the two Gla&s;&s;es; for that a greater Pre&s;&s;ure will more conden&s;e the
included Air in the Weather-gla&s;s, and a le&s;&s;er will &s;uffer it to expand more
than it would have otherwi&s;e done by the Degrees only of Cold and Heat.
And by this method it will not be difficult to adju&s;t two &s;uch Gla&s;&s;es as will
receive no manner of alteration from the motion of the Ship, and may be
$word$ and ea&s;ily carry'd and made u&s;e of in all parts of the World, to the
ex$$$ mo&s;t hot or extrea m$&s;t cold, that can be indur'd by any one that is to
$word$ with them. For as there is no doubt to be made of the Experiment
of the $$$rit of Wine &s;eal'd in the <HI>Thermometer,</HI> &s;o there is no fear of loo&s;eng
or freezing of the Quick&s;ilver in the Weather-gla&s;s, if it be made after the
way that I have herein propos'd; the varying of which In&s;trument I have
<PB N="557" REF="536">
many ways contriv'd, and &s;ome other methods, if I can procure Gla&s;&s;es made,
I &s;hall &s;ome other time acquaint the Society with.</P>
<P>As the Subject of my la&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e was the De&s;cription of two &s;everal
In&s;truments that I conceiv'd would be of great benefit to Navigators and Na|vigation
in general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a new Sea Quadrant.</NOTE> &s;o I de&s;ign in this Di&s;cour&s;e to add the De&s;cription of a
third, which, I judge, will be much more advantageous, by rea&s;on of its fre|quent,
nay con&s;tant, u&s;e and becau&s;e &s;o much of information concerning the
true Latitude of the place, where the Ship is, depends upon the exactne&s;s and
practicablene&s;s of it, I have propounded it by way of Query to divers very
skilful both in the Theory and Practice of Navigation; but (like things of
this Nature before they are known) they have all judg'd it to be impracti|cable,
if not impo&s;&s;ible, and yet I doubt not (when it comes to be known)
&s;ome of them may &s;ay, they knew as much as this before: Others po&s;&s;ibly
may per&s;i&s;t in the u&s;e of &s;uch In&s;truments, as they have been hitherto acquain|ted
with, and others be offended at it becau&s;e it is new; and yet I doubt
not but that, after &s;ome time, it may become of general u&s;e. The In&s;tru|ment which I &s;hew'd the Society, &s;ome Years before the Sickne&s;s, by making
u&s;e of a Tele&s;cope-gla&s;s, in&s;tead of the &s;mall hole or &s;lit of the Shadow-vane
of a Back-&s;taff, was not made u&s;e of 'till about ten Years after, and yet now
it meets with general approbation, and is of continual u&s;e, and pretended to
be the invention of another, tho' my &s;hewing thereof was Printed in the Hi|&s;tory
of the Royal Society. It cannot well be expected that I &s;hould &s;pend
my Time and Studies in inventing In&s;truments, and be at the expen&s;e of
making and putting in practice tho&s;e which I have contriv'd, without re|ceiving
any Benefit or A&s;&s;i&s;tance from tho&s;e to whom they may be of u&s;e, or
any other. It may, I conceive, be judg'd &s;ufficient, by rea&s;onable Men, for
the inventor to contrive and de&s;cribe the Means and Ways how &s;uch as have
occa&s;ion, or de&s;ire of experimenting the thing, may, with ea&s;e enough, put
the &s;ame in practice; at lea&s;t, if his Reward be con&s;ider'd, which, as the
Learned Author of the Hi&s;tory of the Royal Society has ob&s;erv'd, is com|monly
ill Treatment, and not only rough U&s;age from tho&s;e that envy his
acqui&s;ts, but even from the Artificers them&s;elves, for who&s;e &s;ake he has la|bour'd;
whil&s;t another that adds &s;ome &s;mall matter to it, is inrich'd thereby,
but the fir&s;t di&s;coverer it di&s;mi&s;t with Contempt and Impoveri&s;hment.</P>
<P>The In&s;trument which was for a long time us'd for taking the Altitude of
the Sun at Sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The In&s;tru|ments now us'd.</NOTE> was an <HI>A&s;trolube,</HI> which is yet in u&s;e among the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as
I am inform'd; the In&s;trument is, by many Authors, very fully and &s;ufficient|ly
de&s;crib'd that it need not be here repeated, &s;ince that, the <HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch,</HI>
and <HI>French</HI> have made u&s;e of a <HI>Cro&s;s-&s;taff, Back-&s;taff,</HI> or <HI>Quadrant</HI> for that
purpo&s;e, as being found by Experience to be much more exact and certain,
and the adding of a Tele&s;cope-gla&s;s to the Sights, hath, as I mention'd be|fore,
much improv'd both the&s;e qualifications; but they are yet liable to
&s;ome Inconveniences and Defects.</P>
<P>As, Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Defects.</NOTE> They are of little u&s;e in a dark Night, by rea&s;on of the diffi|culty
of exactly &s;eeing the Horizon.</P>
<P>Secondly, They are u&s;ele&s;s al&s;o in the Day time, if Foggs or Mi&s;ts do hin|der
the di&s;tinct di&s;covery of the Horizontal Line.</P>
<P>Thirdly, They are uncertain when Refraction doth elevate or change the
true Horizon, which a certain vaporous Air, near the Surface of the Sea, doth
often cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Fourthly, They are u&s;ele&s;s when the Sun is in or pretty near the
Zenith.</P>
<P>Fifthly, They are trouble&s;ome and require great Dexterity and much
Practice to be us'd &s;o as is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Sixthly, They can hardly be &s;o well made or &s;o well us'd, as to afford the
Ob&s;erver a nearer certainty than about half a Degree.</P>
<P>All Which inconveniences I hope may be avoided by the Invention which I
have here made a Module of, in order to make it the more intelligible.
For,</P>
<P><PB N="558" REF="537">
Fir&s;t&punc; It is as proper and as practicable to take the Altitudes of the Stars
in a dark but clear Night as in the Day, and that to as great exact|ne&s;s;
tho' neither the Horizontal Line, nor any Stars near the Horizon, by
rea&s;on of Foggs or Clouds that darken them, can be di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>Secondly, It is &s;ufficient to take the Altitude of the Sun whenever it ap|pears,

ob&s;erver in the other way.</P>
<P>Fourthly, It will be &s;ufficient to find the true height of the Sun, tho' ne|ver
&s;o near to the Zenith, and that with as much ea&s;e and certainty, as if it
were near the Horizon.</P>
<P>Fifthly, The u&s;e and practice of making Ob&s;ervations with this In&s;tru|ment,

<P>Sixthly, I conceive that Ob&s;ervations may be made with this In&s;trument,
much more accurate than 'tis po&s;&s;ible to make with tho&s;e now commonly
us'd; and as they may be made more exact, &s;o the in&s;trument it&s;elf doth af|ford
a greater certainty, by rea&s;on that the Eye-gla&s;s doth make the Divi|&s;ions
as large and di&s;tingui&s;hable, as if the In&s;trument, without that help,
were four times as large at lea&s;t, nay, I can &s;afely &s;ay, as if the In&s;trument
were ten times as large.</P>
<P>THe Author him&s;elf having given no De&s;cription or Draught of the above|mention'd
Quadrant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tab. 12. Fig. 5.</NOTE> I judg'd it would be acceptable to have &s;ome farther
account of it; wherefore finding a Rude Model of &s;uch an In&s;trument, I have here
attempted a Delineation and De&s;cription thereof, rather than it &s;hould be quite for|gotten
and lo&s;t, tho' I am &s;en&s;ible that I have omitted &s;everal Particularities, which
if the Inventor had made the De&s;cription him&s;elf, would have render'd the In&s;tru|ment
more compleat and manageable; which Defect I hope &s;ame ingenious M$ch ani|cian
will at &s;ome time &s;upply.</P>
<P>ABC the Quadrant, C the Center, which is &s;o contriv'd, that the Sooker, with
the Eye-gla&s;s, is fixt into it at right Angles to the Quadrant. DE a Tele&s;cope mov|ing
on the Center C upon the$ back of the Quadrant, on which al&s;o the Divi&s;ions of
the Degrees made with Diagonals, as u&s;ually. D the Object-gla&s;s. At the end
C, of the Tele&s;cope, is placed a Reflecting-plate at an Angle of 45&deg;. ca&s;ting the I|mage
to the Eye-gla&s;s. A$ a Plumb-li$e pa&s;&s;ing over the Center of the In&s;trument
between the Reflecting-plate and the Eye-gla&s;s, by which means the Object and Per|pendicular
are &s;een in the Center at the &s;ame time, and &s;o the true Altitude of the
Object taken, by fa&s;tning the Tele&s;cope on the divi&s;ions on the back&s;ide. GHIK an
hollow Cover over the Plumb-line, which &s;erves al&s;o for an Handle for the Quadrant.
It may be likewi&s;e very convenient to have the Plumbet play in a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el of
Water fa&s;tened to the lower end of the Handle at F, by which means the Plumber
will be le&s;s &s;ubject to vibrate far, by the oppo&s;ition of a thicker medium than the
Air, which yet will not in the lea&s;t hinder its Perpendicularity.</P>
<P>The preference of this In&s;trument con&s;i&s;ts in the taking the Angle from the Zenith,
rather than from the Horizon, which many times is not di&s;tingui&s;hable, and always
&s;ubject to unnertainty from the difference of Refraction.</P>

with more patience; however I do not doubt but that the humour of Man|kind,
in that particular, has &s;tifled the Productions of many u&s;eful Di&s;co|veries.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that the invention of Tele&s;copes is not yet brought to its

but that I &s;hall be able to &s;hew, that both the Tele&s;cope and the Micro&s;cope
may be ea&s;ily enough advanc'd to much higher degrees of Perfection than
what have been hitherto produc'd. It is not very long &s;ince the invention of
Convex Eye-gla&s;&s;es was found out for &s;eeing a larger Area of the Object;
which, tho' it do not, I confe&s;s, make the Object more di&s;tinct, yet is it of
great u&s;e in Caele&s;tial Ob&s;ervations, e&s;pecially at Sea for the ea&s;y finding
and retaining of the Object in the Tele&s;cope, which, in Tele&s;copes, with
Concave Eye-gla&s;&s;es, is extreamly trouble&s;ome, even in the &s;horte&s;t, and
much more in long ones; however this &s;eems not to have been found out
'till about the time that <HI>Reita</HI> Publi&s;h'd his Book call'd <HI>Oculus Enochi &amp; Eliae,</HI>

This it &s;eems was then a &s;ecret, tho' now generally known and made u&s;e
of for Day Objects, and that even in &s;hort Lengths; but for the Caele&s;tial
Observations where there is not great need of erecting the Object, one or
two Eye-gla&s;&s;es is much more convenient; for that they may be made to take
in a much larger Area, and repre&s;ent the Object much more bright and di|&s;tinct;
howbeit they are both capable of much further improvement, and
con&s;equently be much more adapted for the u&s;e of the Sea, for which occa|&s;ion
I have at this time di&s;cours'd of them.</P>
<P>And I will undertake to accommodate Navigators with Tele&s;copes of two
Foot in length, with which they &s;hall be inabl'd, not only ea&s;ily to find the
Object, but to di&s;cover al&s;o the times of the Eclip&s;es of the <HI>Satellites</HI> of <HI>Ju|piter,</HI>
as exactly as &s;hall be needful.</P>
<P>Let therefore &s;uch Ephemerides be provided, and I &s;hall procure an in|genious
Workman, who &s;hall provide &s;uch Tele&s;copes fit for that purpo&s;e;
&s;o that nothing will then be wanting to compleat the u&s;e of thofe Eclip&s;es
for the di&s;covery of the Longitudes of &s;uch parts as they &s;hall be ob&s;ervable
in, &s;ave only an exact Time-keeper to ob&s;erve the preci&s;e times of &s;uch ap|pearances,
which I can al&s;o accommodate them withal; &s;o that if the pre|ci&s;e
time of the Setting of the Sun for that Night be known, they &s;hall be
&s;ure of the time of the Eclip&s;e to a very few Seconds.</P>
<P>By &s;uch Methods and In&s;truments as I have now de&s;crib'd, if carefully
us'd, I doubt not but that the Sea-Coa&s;ts of all frequented parts of the
World might be truly plac'd as to their Longitudes and Trendings; and the
method of taking Latitudes being a little amended, the exact Situation of
all &s;uch places in &s;ome few Years, might be obtain'd, which would be of
great benefit for the perfecting that part of Geography which at this time
is very imperfect.</P>
<P>In my la&s;t Di&s;cour&s;es I explained three &s;everal In&s;truments for the U&s;e
and Benefit of Navigation, two of which have not been ever yet thought of
by any (that I have heard of) which yet I conceive will (if well made and
put in practice) be of very great advantage to Navigators; for that they are
new a&s;&s;i&s;tants to them in giving them information of what they have no other
ways of Learning: For by means of the la&s;t of the three they will be in|abl'd
to di&s;cover the Latitude, when, by the commonly us'd In&s;truments,
they are nece&s;&s;itated to depend only upon Conjecture; namely, at &s;uch times
either of the Day or Night as the Horizon is not vi&s;ible, and when the Sun
pa&s;&s;es near the Zenith; and 'tis &s;o much the more u&s;eful, for that Nocturnal
Ob&s;ervations may be made at all times, when the parts of the Sky, neat
the Zenith, &s;hall be clear and free from Clouds. Any Ob&s;ervations may be
taken of &s;uch Stars as pa&s;s over or very near the Zenith with more ea&s;e and
certainty than of the Sun it&s;elf in the Day time; for that the Star ob&s;erv'd doth
more preci&s;ely &s;hew the very Points, when and where it pa&s;&s;eth the Zenith
or the Meridian near it; and the Declination of the Star (which may be
learned from Tables ready calculated for that purpo&s;e, e&s;pecially for the
mo&s;t notable and con&s;picuous) will readily give the Latitude of the place.</P>
<P>As for the a&s;&s;i&s;tances the other may afford, it is hard to a&s;certain, yet
&s;ince it hath been found to be of very good u&s;e at Land to prejudge the Con|&s;titution
of the Weather, e&s;pecially of great &s;tore of Wind or Rain, 'tis very
probable it may be of as much, if not more, benefit at Sea, where the Air
&s;eems to be of more general uniformity, e&s;pecially in &s;uch parts of it as are
far remov'd from any Lands; for that the Situation of Mountains or other
diver&s;ify'd parts of the Earth, which arc oftentimes the Cau&s;es of Storms
and Rains on the Land, have little influence upon the parts of the Sea far
remov'd from thm$ Tho' po&s;&s;ibly it may be found that the Gravity
of the Air may be differing at Sea from what it is at Land; which, if &s;o,
might be of no &s;mall benefit to the Navigator, if he, could from that be in|form'd
of his approach to Land. 'Tis not impo&s;&s;ible neither, that it may
afford him &s;ome intimation of the depth of the Sea where he may be, and
many other things very de&s;irable to be known, which I will leave $o the di&s;|covery
of the di$igent Ob&s;erver&punc; There are many things, that before they
are di&s;cover'd, are look'd upon as impo&s;&s;ible, which yet, when the are found,
<PB N="561" REF="540">
are &s;aid to be known by every one, the inventor only excepted, who mu&s;t
pa&s;s for an Ignoramus.</P>
<P>I have many Years &s;ince &s;hewn to this Society (as will, I &s;uppo&s;e, appear
by their Journals) an In&s;trument to keep an exact account of the way of a
Ship through the Water;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a way wi&s;er for a Ship at Sea.</NOTE> whether it has been &s;ince try'd I know not, yet I
have many Years &s;ince that, heard of one or two who were getting a Patent
for a like In&s;trument; whether they &s;ucceeded or not, I have not inquir'd, for
I freely imparted it for a general Good, and &s;hould be glad to here that it
were put in practice, and perform'd what may, in all probability, be expected
from it, which, I conceive, will be a very exact and certain information of
the way of the Ship that u&s;eth it through the Water, it not only mea|&s;uring
the length of the Run, but the Rumb of the Leeward way; and the
Angles made upon the &s;everal Tacks and Cour&s;es; but yet 'tis defective for
finding the true way of the Ship over the parts of the Earth &s;ubjacent to
to that Sea, becau&s;e it di&s;tingui&s;heth not the current or &s;etting of that part
of the Sea without &s;ome other a&s;&s;i&s;tances, whence, 'till they are added, 'tis
u&s;ele&s;s for the invention of the Longitude, which is to be found by other
means: However, 'tis of great u&s;e to know the true Velocity of a Ship
through the Water, in &s;hort Voyages, or in foggy or dark Weather; becau&s;e
it is a great help to judge of their pre&s;ent Po&s;ition as to the true Cour&s;e they
de&s;ign to hold, and in narrow places they can better judge when 'tis fit to
tack about and &s;tand another way.</P>
<P>There is another addition which I thought might al&s;o be of good u&s;e and
information to a Navigator,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Contrivance to know the &s;trength and point of the Wind.</NOTE> and would afford him a means of exactly mea|&s;uring
that which he now knows only at random and by gue&s;s, and that is an
In&s;trument, which being fixt at the top of the Antient or Flagg-&s;taff, &s;hould, at
all times, give the true &s;trength or velocity of the Wind; and the information
thereof may ea&s;ily be convey'd into the great Cabbin or the Steeradge of the
Ship. By the help of this and the former way of mea&s;uring the way of a
Ship, it would be ea&s;y to find with what Winds, whether large or &s;canty;
with what Sails, whether more or fewer, or how plac'd; with what Trim,
with what Burthen or Lading, with what Balla&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Ship makes the
be&s;t way. This is a Propo&s;ition hitherto only prov'd by gue&s;s and &s;trong
Opinion, for the mo&s;t part very prejudicate and precarious; but by this
means it might be brought to a certain Standard of mea&s;ure. By this means
al&s;o the comparative goodne&s;s of Ships for &s;ailing or making their way
through the Water might be brought to a certainty of mea&s;urement, which
cannot &s;o well be done by any other way now u&s;ed; for tho' two Ships may
now &s;ail not far a&s;under, and both intend the &s;ame cour&s;e, yet which ever
has the better of it in &s;ailing fa&s;te&s;t, it will be di&s;putable whether that be
the better Sailer; for tho' they are not far a&s;under, yet that which came
fir&s;t to the Port, might have great advantages of the Wind, which the other
had not; and po&s;&s;ibly it might be the contrary, there being yet no certain way
of determining it, unle&s;s by multiplicity of &s;uch trials, it &s;hall always be
found that the &s;ame Ve&s;&s;el has the advantage, and yet even in this way the
probability indeed is, greater, but yet 'tis but a probability, &s;ince 'tis po&s;|&s;ible
that &s;uch advantages may happen for five or ten times together, and
yet may fail the eleventh time; whereas by this In&s;trument it will plainly ap|pear
which hath had the greate&s;t quantity or &s;trength of the Wind, and
which the lea&s;t; and by the &s;ame In&s;trument it may be certainly determin'd
with what Sails, with what Trim, with what Burthen and with what
Cour&s;e, whether by or large, a Ship, comparatively, Sails be&s;t; as al&s;o it may
be practically examin'd with what Trim or &s;et of the Sails a Ship a &s;ails the
be&s;t when it goes near a Wind, and the like to &s;ee how far Experience will
agree to the Theory; as al&s;o whether flat and taught Sails do b$$ter than
bellying or bunting Sails, which I conceive they do, tho' the mo&s;t part of
Seamen do believe and affirm the contrary with great confidence. I could en|umerate
many other u&s;eful informations the&s;e In&s;truments duly made would
afford, but it is needle&s;s at pre&s;ent, &s;ince what I have mention'd are matters
of &s;o great concern in Naval Affairs to be truly inform'd of, that they alone are
&s;ufficient (one would think) to induce &s;ome Inqui&s;itive Men concerned, to be
<PB N="562" REF="541">
knowing, in the&s;e Affairs, to cau&s;e &s;ome trials to be made thereof, &s;ince no one
can deny but that the Con&s;equences that I have a&s;&s;erted mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow;
that is, that all tho&s;e Particulars which are hitherto only acquir'd by Con|jecture
and Gue&s;&s;ing are by means hereof reduc'd to certainty of Number,
Weight and Mea&s;ure; and tho' &s;ome very skillful in the&s;e Affairs may &s;ay
they can do all that is requir'd well enough, without any &s;uch Invention, by
their own Judgments and long Experience; yet, I conceive, that he that u&s;es
a pair of Compa&s;&s;es &s;hall be able to draw a truer Circle than ever <HI>Apelles,</HI> or
the greate&s;t Arti&s;t that ever drew Line with his Hand, would be able to do
without them.</P>
<P>The In&s;trument I de&s;ign for this purpo&s;e, is but little differing from that
which I long &s;ince contriv'd for mea&s;uring the velocity of the Wind, and
cau&s;ed one of them to be made for the Weather-clock. It has been &s;uffici|ently
&s;een and try'd, and therefore will not, for this time, need a more parti|cular
De&s;cription; however, if any one de&s;igns to make trial thereof, I &s;hall
not be wanting to give the Workman, that makes it, &s;ufficient In&s;truction.</P>

moving; of the effects of which Mon&s;ieur <HI>Huggens</HI> hath treated no further
than thereby to find what is the comparative Gravitation here upon the Sur|face
of the Earth, with re&s;pect to the Gravitation at the di&s;tance of the Moon;
by which Examination of the proportion of Gravity he is much convinc'd
of the truth of that Theory which I had the happine&s;s fir&s;t to invent, and
of which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e more at large on another Subject.
The other effects of Gravity upon Bodies here upon the Earth, which he o|mits,
have been fully di&s;cover'd by <HI>Galileo, Torricellius,</HI> and divers others &s;ince
that time, who have all proceeded upon the equal power of Gravity, and con|&s;equently
&s;uppos'd an equal addition of Acceleration in equal &s;paces of time;
which in &s;hort &s;paces of De&s;cent near the Earth, is <HI>quoad &s;en&s;um</HI> true, there
being no &s;en&s;ible difference between the power of Gravity in &s;o &s;mall a dif|ference
of height, as Nature has allow'd Mankind a Liberty or Power of
arriving at, to make his trials in: As the top of &s;ome high Hill, or at the
bottom of &s;ome deep Mine; tho' yet po&s;&s;ibly with curious In&s;truments and
accurate Ob&s;ervations, &s;omewhat of di&s;covery might be made on &s;uch a Hill
as <HI>Tenariff,</HI> or the <HI>Alps:</HI> For which Inquiry therefore one of the Experi|ments,
which I formerly propos'd, to be try'd at <HI>Tenariff</HI> (and which I
try'd many times my &s;elf, both at the top of St. <HI>Pauls</HI> and at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abby,</HI>
tho' without finding any &s;en&s;ible difference) was intended; as will
appear by the accounts of tho&s;e trials, tho' they were un&s;ucce&s;sful as to what
they were de&s;ign'd for; however &s;everal other Di&s;coveries were made not
unu&s;eful. But I &s;hall not further proceed upon that Contemplation at pre|&s;ent,
but, rather, in this following Di&s;cour&s;e, con&s;ider a third Power of Na|ture
ari&s;ing from the motions of the Air and Water, two fluid Mediums which
incompa&s;s the Body of the Earth. And among the various Effects they
produce, I &s;hall at this time, con&s;ider only one which is procur'd by means of
Art,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Several mat|ters to be known in the Art of Sailing.</HI></NOTE> and that is for the moving or regulating of Ships or Ve&s;&s;els by means
of Sails, Oares, Rudder, and the like artificial Methods of gaining and
making u&s;e of their Powers: It being of great u&s;e for Merchant Ships in
tho&s;e times of danger, to know the be&s;t Methods and Means of making
the&s;e Powers the mo&s;t &s;erviceable to them that may be for flying from and
e&s;caping the pur&s;uit of their Enemies. There are therefore very many things
that mu&s;t be con&s;ider'd, in order to the perfecting of this effect to the great|e&s;t
advantage that is po&s;&s;ible. As the Shape and Bigne&s;s of the Ve&s;&s;el with
con&s;ideration of its U&s;e and De&s;ign, the manner of Rigging it and fitting it
with Ma&s;ts, Sails, and other Tackle, and with Rudder, Oares, Keel, Lee|boards,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Shapes and Magnitudes of each, and the ways of apply|ing
and u&s;ing them to the be&s;t advantage. And herein will come the con&s;i|deration

of the Ve&s;&s;el: The power al&s;o of the Water again&s;t the Rudder, Oares,
Leeboards, Keel, Head and Sides of the Ve&s;&s;el will come under considera|tion;
for it mu&s;t be determin'd what quantity of Sails this or that kind of
Ve&s;&s;el will bear; and what the form of the Sail is be&s;t to be, and how to be
order'd or fitted to the Ve&s;&s;el; how much Balla&s;t &s;uch Ve&s;&s;els &s;o built and

indure; what the &s;trength of the Wind is with relation to its &s;wifter mo|tion

of Men, or other, can be apply'd; and what are the be&s;t and mo&s;t ad|vantageous
<PB N="564" REF="543">
vantageous ways for &s;uch applications: The&s;e, and many other particulars,
ought to be fully examin'd, both by the known Principles of Mechanicks, and
by Experiments on the &s;everal Materials that mu&s;t be introduc'd into the Pro|po&s;itions
of &s;uch Ratiocinations; for that ab&s;tracted Notions will not be &s;o
&s;erviceable in the&s;e Inquiries as the knowledge of the concrete Qualities and
Proprieties. And to be furni&s;h'd with the&s;e many an pertinent Experi|ments
mu&s;t be invented, made, and diligently, as well as knowingly, ob|&s;erv'd;
for that the preponderancy of &s;uch Effects, may, and do often lie
in unheeded Circum&s;tances, and in almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible differences; which ne|verthele&s;s,
upon the re&s;ult of greater trials, prove very notable; and yet,
by rea&s;on of the Difficulty, Charge, lo&s;s of Time, and many other Incon|veniences,
which are the nece&s;&s;ary Concomitants of &s;uch greater Experi|ments,
the &s;maller trials, tho' they require much more watchfulness and
per&s;picatiou&s;ne&s;s are much to be perferr'd: For that more may be examin'd
and verify'd in a Year by the&s;e, than by the other in an Age. And tho' the
bu&s;ine&s;s of Shipping and Navigation hath been many Ages in a way of im|provement,
and &s;omewhat very con&s;iderable has been done towards it, in&s;o|much
that the pre&s;ent &s;tate thereof is look'd upon as the highe&s;t Perfection
it is capable of, yet a few &s;mall trials might ea&s;ily make the ground|le&s;&s;ne&s;s
of that Opinion plainly appear, almo&s;t in every particular of the
artificial Structure of Ve&s;&s;els fitted for that de&s;ign. I am not in&s;en&s;ible of
the difficulties that attend any one that &s;hall be an a&s;&s;erter of this Doctrine;
I have experimentally verify'd the effects of propounding new Inventions to
improve &s;uch as are at the pre&s;ent in vogue; witne&s;s the improvment of A|&s;tronomical
In&s;truments, the Spring-watches, the univer&s;ality of Gravity,
and the motions of the Heavens, according to the Rules and Laws of Me|chanical
Motions. And yet after all the obloquy and reproaches, and un|hand&s;ome
treatment I have met with for making tho&s;e di&s;coveries, I find the
things them&s;elves, in tract of Time, become to be approv'd, and come to
be of general u&s;e. There are, I believe, but very few In the World now
that will adhere to <HI>Hevelius</HI> his magnify'd Contrivances for In&s;truments with
plain Sights, tho' at the &s;ame time they joyn with him in the A&s;per&s;ions he
hath ca&s;t upon me. But to let tliole Reflections pa&s;s at pre&s;ent, I know ve|ry
well, that I &s;hall find, oppo&s;ite to this Doctrine about Ships, not only all
the Architects or Ships Builders, but the Crue of Navigators al&s;o, who are
very hard to be brought to the U&s;e and Practi&s;e of a new Method, and are
not otherwi&s;e to be prevail'd with but <HI>gradatim</HI> by length of Time, and dear
bought Experience. But tho' the mo&s;t are thus qualify'd, yet they are not
all: There are &s;ome that are willing to be better inform'd in this or that
Particular, and will make u&s;e and trial of things, tho' they carry with them
but a probability; for the &s;ake therefore of &s;uch, 'tis if any di&s;covery be
made; but for the re&s;t <HI>Si Populus Vult, decipiatur.</HI></P>
<P>I have had many Di&s;cour&s;es both with &s;ome of the able&s;t Ship-writes,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of flat Sails.</HI></NOTE> and
with as skilful Navigators, and both agree in their Opinions or judg|ments,
that a Bellying or Bunting Sail doth more promote or carry a Ve&s;&s;el
to Windward, than a flat and &s;mooth Sail that bellies not at all; the con|trary
of which I have divers times indeavour'd to defend. In order to clear
the rea&s;onablene&s;s of this A&s;&s;ertion, I have, in the fir&s;t place, con&s;ider'd the
Nature and Power of the Wind upon the Area of a Sail, various ways ex|pos'd
to it; by which, by degrees, I &s;hall come to the evident Demon&s;tra|tion
of what I have a&s;&s;erted: But becau&s;e, po&s;&s;ibly after all that can be
&s;aid and manifested by fuch a Demon&s;tration; tho&s;e that have a&s;&s;erted the
contrary, will not grant the Conclu&s;ion, after the Demon&s;tration; I &s;hall
prepare an Apparatus for the trial of an Experiment where the effect it&s;elf
&s;hall &s;peak the Conclu&s;ion, and that beyond the power of Contradiction.</P>
<P>To come then to the Rea&s;ons that induc'd me to make this Conclu&s;ion;
I &s;ay that fluid Bodies mov'd, do impre&s;s a motion to other Bodies, they
are mov'd again&s;t proportionate to their Gravity and Velocity: This may be
prov'd by thou&s;ands of Experiments. Next I find the Air to be a ponde|rous
fluid Body, who&s;e integrant parts have both bulk and weight in them
as well as the integrant parts of other fluid Terre&s;tial Bodies; as Water,
<PB N="565" REF="544">
Oil, Quick&s;ilver, and the like; and tho' they have a le&s;s proportion of Gra|vity,
if compar'd to their bulk, or the &s;pace they &s;eem to fill, and that &s;o
very &s;mall, that they have, for a long time, been a&s;&s;erted to have a contrary
quality of lightne&s;s, yet, by undeniable Arguments drawn from Experiments,
they are demon&s;trated to have their proportion of Gravity with relation to
their bulk: Which proportion compar'd to the like proportion of Water,
is, for the mo&s;t part, near as 1 to 800 or 900. It follows therefore, that the
motion of this fluid Body mu&s;t, according to the quantity of its Gravity,
impre&s;s upon another Body that it is mov'd again&s;t, &s;uch a quantity of mo|tion
in the &s;ame manner as the like quantity of another fluid Body, as Wa|ter,
and if the motion be the &s;ame, the motion communicated will be as 1
to 800. If the Motions be reciprocal to the Gravities of the &s;triking Bo|dies,
the motions or powers communicated will be equal; for if there be by
the Velocity 28, 3 times as much Air in bulk mov'd again&s;t the Recipient Bo|dy
as there is of the bulk of Water in the &s;ame time, and that the Velocity be
28, 3 &s;wifter than that of the Water, then 28, 3 &times; 28, 3 will produce an equa|lity
of Motion with the eight hundred Gravitating parts in the Water mov'd
with one degree of Velocity, as I &s;hall more particularly prove afterwards.
Thus, if on a Stilyard a weight of thirty Pound be hung at thirty times
the di&s;tance from the Center that a weight of nine hundred Pounds is hung,
the Stilyard &s;hall remain in aequilibrio, and neither end prependerate; for the
thirty Pound cannot be mov'd but it mu&s;t have thirty times the Velocity that
the nine hundred Pound mu&s;t have, and therefore the Stilyard mu&s;t remain
without any motion at all, but &s;tand in a aequilibrium. Since the product of
the bulk and Velocity of the one is equal to the Product of the Bulk and Velo|city
of the other; this therefore holds where effects equiponderate.</P>
<P>The Wind then is nothing el&s;e but the Body of the Air mov'd as a fluid
with a certain degree of Velocity towards a certain part of the Horizon
upon the Surface or the Earth or Sea, and, as other fluid Mediums, it take$$$
the ea&s;ie&s;t and &s;horte&s;t way it findeth to continue its direct motion; moving
round the edges of the Body that &s;tandeth in its way, after it hath $eat a|gain&s;t
it, and been reflected from it, and the parts reflected are quickly a|gain,
by the &s;ucceeding Parts, recruited in their motion, and move along
with the other parts which have received no Impediment. The power of
the Wind therefore is to be computed according to the bigne&s;s of the Pri&s;
of the Air which cometh to da&s;h or &s;trike again&s;t the Body that is expos'd
to it; and according to the Velocity that this Pri&s;m is mov'd forwards to
&s;trike again&s;t it: For a fluid Medium, in motion, is to be con&s;ider'd as
made up of an indefinite number of &s;mall Cylinders, Pri&s;ms, Wires or
Strings lying clo&s;e together, and &s;o making up the Solidity of the greater
Pri&s;m of the Body of the fluid that is mov'd towards the Ob&s;tacle; and a|gain
each of thc&s;e &s;mall Pri&s;ms or Wires may be &s;uppos'd as made up of an
indefinite number of &s;mall Beads or Dies lying one behind another, and &s;o
following each other immediately in the &s;ame Line, and with the &s;ame Velo|city
of motion, and every one of the&s;e compounding Beads or Dies coming
to beat or &s;trike again&s;t the Body that lieth in its way, it &s;o &s;irikes it and
communicates a motion; what motion it doth not communicate to that Bo|dy
it meets with, is reflected back from it, with, or by an Angle equal to
the Angle of Incidence. So that upon this con&s;ideration each of the &s;mall
Pri&s;ms may be computed as a &s;ingle Bullet or Die, &s;o &s;triking the Surface of
the expos'd Body with one degree of power all of bulk equal to the many
&s;ingle ones &s;eparate; and the larger Pri&s;m made up of an indefinite number
of the&s;e le&s;&s;er Wires or Pri&s;ms, may be conceiv'd and computed as a larger
Bead or Die, relation being always had to the Gravity and Velocity of the
impelling or &s;triking Body. Now a round Body being mov'd again&s;t another
Body, impre&s;&s;eth on it &s;ome degree of motion, and what it doth not com|municate,
is reflected from it, according to the known Laws of Reflection;
that is, the reflected Angle is equal to the Angle of Incidence upon the plain
of the Body &s;truck, and the Body &s;truck receiveth a motion Perpendicular to
the Surface of it that is &s;o &s;truck.</P>
<P><PB N="566" REF="545">
To come then to the Application of the Power of the Wind upon the
Sails of a Ve&s;&s;el, we are to con&s;ider the Expan&s;ion of the Sail, as it is ex|pos'd
to the Impul&s;e of the Wind; whether the Surface of it do cut the
Pri&s;m of the Wind that beareth again&s;t it at right Angles or Oblique; if it
cutteth the Pri&s;m at Right Angles, then the whole power of a Pri&s;m of
Wind or Air that cometh to blow upon it for a certain time, who&s;e Ba&s;is is
equal and at right Angles with the length of the Pri&s;m, is to be computed
as communicating all its motion: But if the Area of the Sail cut the Pri&s;m
at oblique Angles, then we mu&s;t conceive the Scalene Pri&s;m as cut at right
Angles, and compare the Area thereof with the Area of the Sail; and this
will give the magnitude or quantity of the impelling Pri&s;m of Wind again&s;t
the oblique Sail. Again, to know with what force this Scalene Pri&s;m doth pre&s;s
or impel the Sail &s;o obliquily po&s;ited Perpendicularly to its Surface, we
mu&s;t compare the Degrees of Velocity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Calculati|on of the &s;trength and difference.</HI></NOTE> with which it is mov'd directly to|wards
the Area of the oblique Sail, and &s;ee what proportion it holdeth with
the direct and perpendicular motion upon the direct Sail; and by both the&s;e
Examinations duly made, the comparative power of the Wind upon the $A|rea
of the &s;loped Sail will appear. Let ab then repre&s;ent the breadth of a
Sail of a given height, and let abcd repre&s;ent a Pri&s;matical Body of the
Air, which being mov'd from dc to ab in a given &s;pace of Time, maketh a
Wind of &s;uch &s;trength bear or beat again&s;t the Surface of the Sail ab direct|ly
oppos'd to its cour&s;e, and in the given time all the parts of the Pri&s;m
abcd have &s;truck again&s;t the Surface of the Sail ab. Suppo&s;e then ab no,
to repre&s;ent a Pri&s;m of Water, of equal Ba&s;e with the &s;aid Sail ab, and
that an, or bo, the length of the &s;aid Pri&s;m be &frac13; of the length ad or bc
the Pri&s;m of Air mov'd the contrary way with thirty times the Velocity, if
the proportion of the Gravity of the Air be to the Gravity of the Water,
as one to nine hundred: I &s;ay, the Sail &s;hall not be mov'd either way, but
remain in an aequilibrium: For as the Velocity of the motion of the Wa|ter
an, 1 is to the Velocity of the motion of the Air ad 30; &s;o the Gravity
of the Pri&s;m of the Air ab cd 30, to the Gravity of the Pri&s;m of Water
abon 900. Now becau&s;e the &s;ame power is impre&s;t on the Sail, whether
the Cylinder of Water be mov'd again&s;t the Sail from no to ab, or the Sail
be mov'd again&s;t the Water from ab to no; if the &s;aid Cylinder of Air be
made one degree &s;wifter, it mu&s;t drive the fame Sail from ab, to no.</P>
<P>Next &s;uppo&s;e Ef to repre&s;ent the &s;ame Sail, &s;et obliquely to the Pri&s;m or
Current of the Wind, draw eh, and fg, parallel to ad. Fir&s;t then it is plain,
that akhd and bcgi of the former Pri&s;m do now not at all touch the &s;aid
Sail ef, but only the middle part of the &s;ame, namely, kigh; now the
quantity of this to the quantity of the former, being as ki to ab; that is, as
pf, the &s;ine of the Angle of incidence pef to the Radius ef, or ab, it fol|lows
that the quantity of Wind upon the direct Sail to the quantity &s;triking
the oblique Sail is, as Radius to the &s;ign of the Angle of Incidence.</P>
<P>Again, the power of this Pri&s;m upon the oblique Sail ef, is to the power
of it upon the direct Sail, equal to ki, as el to fl; that is, as fp to fe; that
is, as the &s;ine of the Angle of Incidence pef to the Radius; therefore the
power of the Wind upon the Sail ab, directly oppos'd to its motion is to the
power of it upon the &s;ame Sail &s;et oblique to its motion, as the &s;quare of
Radius, to the &s;quare of the Angle of Incidence, or of the obliquity to the
Wind pef.</P>
<P>Now that the motion of the oblique Sail is to the motion of the direct
Sail by the &s;ame Pri&s;m of Wind as pf to fe, will plainly appear: Suppo&s;e
pfgh a &s;olid Cylinder meeting with pfa direct Sail at pf, and fe the oblique
Sail; then pf will be carry'd on to ql, at the &s;ame time that ef will be mov'd
to lm; the motion therefore of pf is equal to fl, but the motion of ef is equal
to el: But as fl to el, &s;o fe to fp, &s;o Radius to the &s;ine of Inclination or O|bliquity.</P>
<P>Now that the &s;trength or power of the Wind upon the Oblique Sail is Per|pendicular
to the &s;aid Sail, is evident from this Con&s;ideration, that if the Sail
be &s;uppos'd perfectly flat and &s;mall in its Surface, there is no part that the
Wind can take hold of to drive it forward in its own way, and having no
<PB N="567" REF="546">
part oppo&s;ite to the power thereof, but only the &s;aid &s;mooth Surface that
can only receive a Perpendicular pre&s;&s;ure, and that pre&s;&s;ure can only move
or thru&s;t it toward the Perpendicular of its Surface: If therefore a Sail
be perfectly flat and &s;mooth, all the force it receives is towards the Perpen|dicular
of its Surface. Which Perpendicular force notwith&s;tanding may
cau&s;e it to move in any other direction which is inclin'd to the &s;aid Perpendi|cular,
by &s;ome Angle le&s;s than a right, according as the &s;aid Sail may be &s;o
fix'd to a Body that &s;hall have a more ea&s;y way for it to pa&s;s that way than
towards the Perpendicular. This may be explain'd from the con&s;ideration
of the power or Gravity: The power of Gravity then we know tends to
move the heavy Body towards the Perpendicular of the Horizon, that is,
towards the Center of the Earth; but if the heavy Body be &s;o po&s;ited on a
P$ain that has any inclination to the &s;olid Perpendicular; that is, maketh a
le&s;s Angle with it than a right Angle; we know that the power of Gravity,
tho' it acts directly towards the Perpendicular, yet it moveth and impelleth
it to de&s;cend obliquely in any other Plain dipping below the Horizon. Now
the proportion of the power of the Wind upon the oblique Sail to drive it
backwards towards the Perpendicular, is to the proportion of its power to
drive it in any other Plain, is ea&s;y to be determin'd, but that I &s;hall refer to
another opportunity.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince by this afore recited Cau&s;e it is evident, that the power of the
mov'd Air or Wind upon an oblique Sail, doth pre&s;s or protrude it Per|pendicularly
to the Surface of the Sail, and thence, if there be as free a pa&s;|&s;age
that way, as any other, the Sail will be mov'd, and move the Ve&s;&s;el to
which it is fix'd in the &s;aid Perpendicular; it follows, that if there be any
other part of the &s;aid Sail that has a differing inclination, it will have a differing
Perpendicular, and con&s;equently every part of the bent Sail will have a dif|fering
pre&s;&s;ure and a differing tendency; and becau&s;e that part of the Sail
which is next the Wind, is le&s;s belly'd than that which is from the Wind,
more of the Perpendicular Tendencies will be to fall from the Wind than to
go nigh or towards the Wind, and con&s;equently, the compo&s;ition of all the
tendencies together, will have le&s;s power to pre&s;s the bent Sail towards the
Perpendicular of the &s;et of the Yard of the Sail, than if the Sail were all
&s;mooth in the plain of the Yard; for the fore part of the Sail next the Wind
becometh, by the bellying, to &s;tand too &s;harp and near the Wind, and &s;o
receiveth little power or force from the Wind, to promote it according to
tho&s;e Perpendiculars, and the Aft-parts of the Sail &s;tand too full, and &s;o re|ceive
mo&s;t of its power, who&s;e Perpendiculars tend too much from and be|fore
the Wind; and the middle parts of the Sail which &s;tand only true, are
&s;o &s;mall a part of the whole, that the mo&s;t part of the effect of the Wind is
lo&s;t or mi&s;taken for the de&s;ir'd end.</P>
<P>This is one of the great Rea&s;ons why a Ve&s;&s;el, that is thus rigged, is not
able to &s;ail on any Rumb within four Points, and why even there &s;o little
way is made to the Windward, tho' there are &s;everal other Rea&s;ons al&s;o; of
which I &s;hall Di&s;cour&s;e on another opportunity.</P>

<HI>Geometry, A&s;tronomy, Geography,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And tho' the devouring Teeth of Time hath &s;carce left us any &s;crap of
Hi&s;tory that &s;hould acquaint us with the knowledge and practice of Men in
the fir&s;t Ages of the World, yet &s;uch as we have do &s;ufficiently inform us,
that in the younger times of the World, Ships and Navigation were known,
witne&s;s <HI>Homer, Ja&s;on,</HI> and the <HI>Argonauts</HI> not now to in&s;i&s;t on, what we find
in Holy Writ concerning the <HI>Ark of Noah,</HI> which, tho' the Shape, Dimen|&s;ions
and Manner of building that Ve&s;&s;el, which was for a very peculiar and
extraordinary U&s;e, were divinely reveal'd to <HI>Noah,</HI> yet it &s;eems not unlike|ly
but that there might be many other &s;orts of Ve&s;&s;els known and in u&s;e long
before that time, as in probability there were many Arks or Che&s;ts for com|mon
u&s;e long before the Lord directed <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the Bigne&s;s, Form and Ma|terials
of the &s;econd <HI>Ark,</HI> which was the <HI>Ark of the Te&s;timony.</HI> But this I
&s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on; I know the Accounts are but very &s;hort, and &s;o nothing
po&s;itivively concluded from thence that there were Ships; much le&s;s can we
find what they were, or to what perfection <HI>Navigation</HI> was practis'd: Nay,
we are much to &s;eek what was the true form of Ships in the more modern
Times of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans;</HI> of which times, notwith&s;tanding, in re&s;pect
of other particulars, we have much more full and compleat Relations. That
there were Ve&s;&s;els of prodigious bulk and burthen, we are a&s;&s;ur'd by <HI>Pliny,
Plutarch,</HI> and others; that they carry'd prodigious numbers of Men, both of
Soldiers and Seamen, that they had great numbers of Oars and Men to ma|nage
them; and that they had Balla&s;t, Mai&s;s, Sails and Rudders, and could
Sail both before and by the Wind, is al&s;o evident. But then what was the
true &s;hape of the Ve&s;&s;el both under and above the Water; what the form
of their Oars and how they us'd them; what their greate&s;t velocity either
of Sailing or Rowing; what their &s;trength for bearing Sail, or induring the
Sea, and the like; of the&s;e Hi&s;tories give &s;o little an account, that the be&s;t
Judgments of the greate&s;t Criticks, are but uncertain Conjectures and &s;hort
of giving &s;atisfactory An&s;wers and Solutions, And had not the antient Car|vers
help'd the Hi&s;torians, we &s;hould have been much more to &s;eek; for ac|cording
to the De&s;criptions that Criticks have given us of the way of u&s;ing
their Oars, which is much after the Modern way of u&s;ing them in Boats,
Barges and Gallies; I &s;ee not how it could be po&s;&s;ible to manage the upper|mo&s;t
Oar of forty or fifty; for &s;o many, 'tis &s;aid by <HI>Plut arch</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> and
others, have been us'd in each order. I have therefore omitted all the Cri|tici&s;ms
concerning this matter; of which there is much to be found in <HI>Bu|daeus,
Bayfius, Scaliger, Snellius, Pancirollus,</HI> and more e&s;pecially <HI>Meibomius;</HI> and
apply'd my &s;elf to con&s;ider the thing as I find it expre&s;s'd in the remaining
<HI>Ba&s;&s;o Relievos</HI> of the Antients. And upon the whole I conceive that the way
of Rowing us'd by the Antients, was wholly differing from what we now $&s;e,
and not at all like that which the Learned <HI>Meibomius</HI> has taken &s;o much pains
to explain.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not trouble you with long <HI>Ambages</HI> either in confuting the Opinions
of others or Critici&s;ing upon the Words or Phra&s;es of Hi&s;torians, but rather
in &s;hort tell you the &s;um of what I judge of this matter.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, I conceive, that the Oars us'd by the Antients were very much like
the Oars now us'd, but broader and flatter, &s;horter and lighter, and manag$d
only by one or two.</P>
<P>Secondly, That they were mov'd not vibrating forward and backwards as
ours now are, but inwards and outwards.</P>
<P><PB N="569" REF="548">
Thirdly, That they did not lie Horizontal as ours do, but almo&s;t Perpen|dicular;
and when they lay a ground, the Oares &s;erv'd in&s;tead of Legs or
Props to &s;u&s;tain the Ve&s;&s;el or Hull when its Belly was not broad enough to lie
upright, and it was crank &s;ided.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That they were not lifted out of the Water, but always re|main'd
immers'd.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That they always promoted the Ve&s;&s;el whether they were mov'd
outwards or inwards.</P>
<P>Sixthly, That the Rowers did &s;eldom &s;it with their Faces to the Poop of
the Ve&s;&s;el, but &s;ometimes with their Faces toward the Prow, and, for the
mo&s;t part, with their Faces outward and forwards.</P>
<P>Seventhly, That in the &s;maller Ve&s;&s;els as <HI>Biremes, Triremes Quadriremes,</HI>
and <HI>Penteres,</HI> the Oares went through round holes made in the &s;ides.</P>
<P>Eighthly, That in the <HI>Triremes</HI> the <HI>Thranites</HI> &s;at formo&s;t, and at the top
the <HI>Zygites</HI> ju&s;t behind him and below him; and 3<HI>dly,</HI> The <HI>Thalamites</HI> behind
the <HI>Zygites</HI> and below him, and &s;o the <HI>Zygites</HI> Oare was mov'd up and down be|hind
the back of the <HI>Thranites</HI> and the <HI>Thalamites</HI> behind the <HI>Zygites.</HI></P>
<P>Ninethly, That the Hull of the <HI>Triremes,</HI> &amp;c. were built much bredthing or
&s;preading upwards, and over hanging, &s;o that the holes that were made for
the Oares of the <HI>Zygites</HI> and <HI>Thalamites</HI> went out almo&s;t Perpendicular; and
in &s;ome there was an over&s;ailing, or projecture of the Hull at the place, but
e&s;pecially in greater Ve&s;&s;els; the Oares of the <HI>Thranites</HI> were either put thro'
a hole of the checquer'd Railings at the top, or el&s;e laid in a Notch on the
edge of the Ships &s;ides, and bound down either with an Iron or Rope; &s;o
that when the <HI>Thranites</HI> thru&s;t the handle of his Oar from him, it would not
ri&s;e out of the Notch.</P>
<P>Tenthly, That the <HI>Remiges</HI> or Rowers in greater Ve&s;&s;els, &s;uch as the <HI>Hep|teres,
Octoeres,</HI> &amp;c, were plac'd Galleries which over&s;ail'd the Hull of the
Ve&s;&s;el, which were made by Beams lying quite cro&s;s the Hull of the Ship
and made a very broad Dock, not like the Modern Gallies, but &s;uch, as I
conceive, was quite flu&s;h from end to end of the Beams; at the other &s;ide
of which Galleries there was made a grating or &s;ide to defend the Rowers.
In the&s;e kinds of Ve&s;&s;els the <HI>Remiges</HI> or Rowers did &s;tand &s;ide to &s;ide, and
the Oar went Perpendicular into the Sea, in the out part of the over&s;ailing
Beams, and the Rowers, in the way of Skulling, mov'd their Oars altogether,
either outward or inward; by which means they were able to employ &s;uch
a va&s;t number of Rowers, wherein every one &s;hould be able to exert his
whole &s;trength in promoting the Ship, and &s;o mu&s;t needs be able to make it
move with a prodigious &s;wiftne&s;s, much beyond the &s;wiftne&s;s of any Gally or
Galliot.</P>
<P>By this means what <HI>Plutarch</HI> writes concerning the Ve&s;&s;el built by <HI>Ptolo|maeus
Philopator</HI> may be well conceiv'd, which would otherwise &s;eem incre|dible
and impo&s;&s;ible; for 'twas 280 Cubits long, or, as <HI>Snellius</HI> computes,
420 Cubits and 38 in bredth, or 57 Foot; the height from bottom to top was
52 Cubits; it carry'd 400 Mariners be&s;ides 4000 Rowers, and near 3000
Soldiers. How the&s;e Rowers &s;hould be plac'd according to the forms they
conceiv'd, both <HI>Scaliger</HI> and <HI>Snellius</HI> were at a great lo&s;s; in&s;omuch that <HI>Snellius</HI>
thinks it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;po&s;e the Rowers, unle&s;s they were pack'd up like Salt
Herrings. <HI>Vt nefas &s;it credere haec tran&s;tra a Remigibus occupari potui&s;&s;e, ni&s;i for|&s;an
cos tanquam halices &amp; &s;al&s;amem a &s;tipatos intelligas,</HI> are his words. And,
according to the manner of Rowing they conceiv'd, it would have been ve|ry
difficult. Nor would <HI>Meibomius</HI> his Contrivance have help'd them; but
in the way I propounded of the &s;preading of the Ve&s;&s;el upward; it will not
be difficult, where, tho' the highe&s;t Oars will be frill the longe&s;t, and &s;o
they will need a Counterpoi&s;e of Lead at the Handle to ballance the weight
of the Shank, as <HI>Atheneus</HI> affirms they had in this Ve&s;&s;el of <HI>Ptolomaeus Philopa|tor,</HI>
yet going down into the Water nearer to a Perpendicular than a Hori|zontal
Po&s;ture, it may ea&s;ily enough be conceiv'd; but the&s;e kind of mon|&s;trous
Ve&s;&s;els were rather for &s;hew than u&s;e, as <HI>Snellius</HI> well ob&s;erves.</P>
<P>Eleventhly, That the flat of the Blade of the Oar did not go into the
Water Perpendicular, and cro&s;s the length of the Ve&s;&s;el, as our Oars
<PB N="570" REF="549">
now, but rather parallel with the length of the Ve&s;&s;el, and &s;o were canted
with the foremo&s;t edge outwards, when they were &s;trained outwards and
the foremo&s;t edge inward, when they were &s;train'd towards the Ve&s;&s;el; by
which means they always promoted and impell'd the Ve&s;&s;el forwards, and
that in a very natural and efficacious way; in the &s;ame manner, as all Fi&s;hes
do &s;wim and force their way through the Water.</P>
<P>Twelfthly, To confirm this Opinion, I &s;hall only in&s;tance in the Modern
Practi&s;e, which is yet in u&s;e in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> where this manner of Row|ing
is &s;till in u&s;e, tho' &s;omewhat mixed with the Northern or our modern
way of Rowing; for in their Barges the Rowers all &s;tand, and indifferently
with their Face or Back to the Prow of the Ve&s;&s;el, and &s;ometimes half one
way half the other, and &s;o indifferently can make the Ve&s;&s;el move forwards or
backwards without altering their po&s;ture; as, without que&s;tion, all the an|tient
Ve&s;&s;els could likewi&s;e be mov'd; which gives a Rea&s;on why, in <HI>Ptolo|my</HI>'s
Ve&s;&s;el, there were four Rudders, namely, one on each &s;ide before, or
in the Prow, and one on each &s;ide behind or in the Poop. And the <HI>Indian</HI>
Rudder al&s;o which is &s;till in u&s;e, is of the &s;ame fa&s;hion with that of the <HI>Greeks</HI>
and <HI>Romans,</HI> &s;ave only, that in&s;tead of planting it on each end the Ve&s;&s;el,
they place it in the middle abaft, and &s;o it indifferently &s;erves for Steering
the Ve&s;&s;el, whether going forward or backwards, and is much more conve|nient
and ea&s;y to manage than the way of Rudders now in u&s;e with us. The
Curry Curries al&s;o are &s;till mov'd or row'd in the &s;ame manner with tho&s;e of
the Antients, as I conceive, the Rowers &s;itting all on Bamboos at a di&s;tance
from the Ve&s;&s;el and Sculling the Ve&s;&s;el by canting the Oars in the manner
I have de&s;crib'd; and 'tis not unlikely but the Gallerys of Gallies might have
been &s;ome Remainder of the Galleries of the Antients, tho' they are accom|modated
to the Modern way of Rowing.</P>
<P>I am not in&s;en&s;ible how great the Difficulties are in the introducing a new
Opinion: Or to per&s;uade one, that has long believ'd a thing to be one way,
that it is another, e&s;pecially about &s;uch matters as are thought to be thorough|ly
under&s;tood, and mo&s;t generally put in practice and approv'd. But then
I know al&s;o, that how generally &s;oever any thing be believ'd and a&s;&s;erted to
be true, and the be&s;t that 'tis po&s;&s;ible, yet that there may be, hath been,
and always will be left room enough to find out farther Di&s;coveries
and Improvements of Mens Knowledge and Under&s;tanding, even in that
particular, and that 'tis as hard to find and &s;et Bounds and Limits to
the power of the Mind; as to &s;et what is the greate&s;t or lea&s;t Exten&s;ion or
Demen&s;ion of Body in Nature: I expect the Criticks fir&s;t, next the Skilful
in the pre&s;ent Naval Architecture, And, Thirdly, Such as have not &s;o
much con&s;ider'd this part of Mechanicks, may be opponents to this particu|lar
Opinion and Explication of this piece of antient Hi&s;tory, who&s;e fate it
hath been hitherto either not to be under&s;tood, or not to be believ'd; for
what hath hitherto been the cau&s;e of the&s;e Effects may &s;till remain &s;o to
have an influence upon Mens Minds, as not ea&s;ily to admit the entrance of
a new or contrary propo&s;al. However, as far as I am able, I &s;hall indeavour
to &s;atisfy each of the&s;e Opponents in the explication of tho&s;e things which
may &s;eem the mo&s;t difficult.</P>
<P>It cannot be expected, I &s;uppo&s;e, that from &s;ome few collected Rafts and
Fragments which have &s;cap'd the devouring Sea of Time, in which the Arts
and Knowledge of the Antients have been Shipwrack'd and lo&s;t, I &s;hould be
able to give &s;o true and po&s;itive an account of every particular part, as could not
be contradicted: But taking for granted that the Hi&s;tories are true that af|ford
us that information we have; I conceive there is no difficulty to &s;hew a
way how the &s;ame might be effected which is affirm'd to have been done; and
to begin with the &s;malle&s;t which was the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or a Boat with one Oar:
This was fa&s;tned to one &s;ide behind, in the &s;ame manner as the <HI>Temo</HI> or Rud|der,
by a Strap or Ring, or el&s;e was put through a hole; the handle of which,
the Rower &s;itting with his Face towards the Prow, and holding in his two
Hands, mov'd fromwards and towards the &s;ide of the Ve&s;&s;el, canting the
<HI>Ton&s;a</HI> or Blade thereof with his Hands, by which the Ve&s;&s;el was both readi|ly
promoted and al&s;o guided; of this Oar the <HI>Ton&s;a</HI> or blade was very broad,
<PB N="571" REF="550">
by which means the Rower could exert his whole &s;trength the better. The
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> had two of the flat Oars behind on each &s;ide one, which
were either mov'd by two Men, or el&s;e &s;ometimes by one who manag'd the
two Oars, in each Hand one. So <HI>Lucian</HI> brings in <HI>Charon</HI> in his Dialogues
thus &s;peaking, <HI>Ego quamvis &s;enex duos remos concitans navigo Solus.</HI> Not like
our common Scullers which manage their Oars almo&s;t on a level, but after
the &s;ame manner, as I before mention'd was done by the <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">: The man|ner
of u&s;ing the&s;e will appear plainly from the Ba&s;&s;o-Relievos on the <HI>Columna
Trajana,</HI> which is a mo&s;t undeniable Record of Hi&s;tory, and to be prefer'd
before any Writings in Books of tho&s;e times, &s;ince there may have been &s;o
many Tran&s;cripts or Coppies made one after another, of Hi&s;torians, and e|very
one of tho&s;e might multiply the Errors and Mi&s;takes of the fir&s;t
Transcriber, whence Criticks find and amend &s;o many Errors and make more,
whereas this has undoubtedly &s;tood the &s;ame &s;ince it was fir&s;t erected, which
was in the time of <HI>Trajan</HI> when tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els were actually made and us'd.
This gave me the fir&s;t Hint or Conception of this way of u&s;ing the Oars,
and I cannot find any one pa&s;&s;age either in the Carving or Writings of the
Antients that doth any ways contradict it; and taking that for granted, it
will be ea&s;y to explain all that is related in Hi&s;tory concerning their greater,
even their greate&s;t Ve&s;&s;els which had the greate&s;t numbers of Rowers and
Oars, which I take to be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to be done any other way.</P>
<P>Now that this is not &s;o prepo&s;terous a Conception as &s;ome may imagine, nor
&s;o fanta&s;tical, ridiculous, &s;illy and in&s;ignificant a way of u&s;ing Oars, as &s;ome have
thought: give me leave to add one Argument, and that is this, that Nature
is generally the be&s;t guide for Art to imitate. If this be doubted, I can pro|duce
Arguments enough to evince it; but if it be not, then, I &s;ay, that this
way of Rowing (which I propo&s;e) comes the neare&s;t to the method of Na|$$$$
in the making animated Bodies pa&s;s through fluid Mediums, and there|$$$$
$word$ probably the be&s;t; for there is &s;carce a Fi&s;h in the Water, a Bird or
$word$ ct in the Air but moves it&s;elf through tho&s;e fluid <HI>Media</HI> by the &s;ame me|thod
with this I propound; that both the Tails and Fins of Fi&s;hes are
this way mov'd, is mo&s;t evident to any one that &s;hall &s;trictly examine it; and
<HI>Borell&punc;</HI> in his Book <HI>D$ $word$ A$imalium</HI> has well explain'd it, that &s;everal of
tho&s;e Birds that dive under Water, &s;uch as <HI>Didappers, Coots, Puffins,</HI> &amp;c. do
under Water move their Wings in this manner, I have often times &s;een my
&s;elf and ob&s;erv'd: And that all Birds and In&s;ects by the &s;ame kind of motion
of their Wings, fly in the Air: Any that will examine will &s;o find it. So that
could there have been a better way, Nature would have taken it. Some mo|tions
indeed there are that &s;eem a little to imitate this, and that is the mo|tion
of the Sea Fowl, <HI>Swans, Goo&s;e, Coots,</HI> &amp;c. at the top of the Water, when
they begin to ri&s;e and take the Wing; but then 'tis but by accident; for
all the&s;e Fowl indeavouring to u&s;e their Wings by &s;triking the Air, being
near the Water, &s;trike the Surface of it with the extreamity or blade of their
Wings, after they have fir&s;t &s;truck the Air; and with the flat of their Feet
help to pu&s;h them&s;elves forward to get a celerity of Progre&s;&s;ion, which is
nece&s;&s;ary for their ri&s;e, treading, as it were, the top of the Water, and for
want of that help, &s;ome of the &s;hort Wing'd Fowl, as <HI>Puffins,</HI> &amp;c. are not
able to ri&s;e into the Air from plain ground, but from the Rocks they precipi|tate
them&s;elves on their Wings to acquire a nece&s;&s;ary velocity; which all o|ther
long Winged Fowl are able to procure by the help of their Feet, &s;wift|ly
treading the Ground, and with their long Wings beating the Air.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Objections I have yet met with are the&s;e, Firft, That 'twas
ab&s;urd to conceive, that the Ships Row'd &s;ometimes backwards as well as
forwards, and had Rudders at both ends, but for this <HI>Suidas</HI> upon the word
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, &s;ays <HI>&s;unt &amp; quaedam quae binis gubernaculis a prora &amp; a puppi in&s;tructae
&s;unt, ut ubi&abque; conver&s;ione in ho&s;tes navis feratur aut Recedat, eo&s;&abque; tam progre&s;&s;u
quam Rece&s;&s;u fallat.</HI> And that &s;ome Ships had &s;uch Rudders. <HI>viz.</HI> two before
and two behind, is evident from the De&s;cription of <HI>Philopator</HI>'s Ship al&s;o in
the fifth Book of <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> where he &s;ays it was <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>biprora
&amp; bipuppis,</HI> a double bottom'd Ve&s;&s;el, or two join'd together; for otherwi&s;e
I cannot conceive how three thou&s;and arm'd Men could be plac'd between the
<PB N="572" REF="551">
Rowers, on which there were two thou&s;and on each &s;ide. Now by this way
of Rowing, I &s;uppo&s;e the Rowers could very ea&s;ily, with the &s;ame motion of
the Oar, Row the Ship either forward or backwards; and tho' they had but
one Rudder, yet they could ea&s;ily Steer the Ve&s;&s;el by it, tho' $it were mov'd
backwards; for the Blade <HI>Ton&s;a,</HI> or palm of the Rudder, was broad and e|qually
extended on both &s;ides the Stalk or middle, and &s;o was always on a
Counterpoi&s;e.</P>
<P>The manner how the <HI>Ton&s;a</HI> of the Oar cut the Water will be better un|der&s;tood
by the Figure than by the words alone. Let AB repre&s;ent the Wa|ter
Section of a Dicrotos; E and N the canting Section of the Palm of the
Oars in the Water; the&s;e being mov'd outwards from the Boat, &s;lide again&s;t
the Water from E to F, and from N to O, and at the &s;ame time carry the
Ve&s;&s;el from AB to CD; then the Cants of the Oars being alter'd at G and P,
and mov'd inward, they &s;lide again&s;t the &s;ide of the Water by the Lines GH
and PQ, and promote the Ve&s;&s;el from IK to LM, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; which
is the &s;ame motion with the Tail of a Fi&s;h in the Water, by which its Body is
mo&s;t powerfully carry'd forwards; which is ea&s;y to be conceiv'd, and will
effectually perform what it ought to do.</P>
<P>This &s;ingle motion then once under&s;tood, it will not be difficult to con|ceive
all the re&s;t in any of their other Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Moneres</HI> was nothing but &s;everal Couples of the&s;e Oars lying one
before another, as thick as they could &s;it, leaving only room for the Perpen|dicular
motion of the Handle of the Oar behind the back of the next Rower
that &s;at before him, and not &s;o much &s;pace as is requir'd in the modern way
of Rowing, where the motion of the Handle or Blade of the Oar is Horizon|tal.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dieres</HI> or <HI>Biremes</HI> were double Orders of tho&s;e Oars or Rowers; the
Rowers &s;ometimes &s;itting &s;ide by &s;ide, upon the &s;ame Bench, the <HI>Thranites</HI>
&s;itting next the &s;ide, and the <HI>Zygites</HI> next within; the <HI>Thranites</HI> Oar u&s;ually
lay at the top in a half round Notch, and in the in&s;ide was tied down with a
Strap call'd <HI>Strappum</HI> by <HI>Vitruvius,</HI> or el&s;e it way thru&s;t through &s;ome hole of
the Rails at the &s;ides of the Ve&s;&s;el, the Oar of the <HI>Zygites</HI> pa&s;s'd through a
$ole, a little below and nearer to the Poop, and cut the Water with the
&s;ame inclination.</P>
<P>The <HI>Trieres</HI> or <HI>Triremes</HI> had three <HI>Ver&s;us</HI> or Files of the&s;e Rowers, there
being three in each <HI>Ordo</HI> or Rank; the <HI>Thalanites</HI> and <HI>Zygites,</HI> for the mo&s;t
part, &s;at as in the <HI>Biremes,</HI> but the <HI>Thalamites</HI> &s;at upon the Foot-&s;tep of the
<HI>Thranites;</HI> the Oars of the <HI>Zygites</HI> and <HI>Thramites</HI> went through round holes
in the &s;ide of the Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quadriremes</HI> had four Rowers in a Rank, &s;itting upon the upper Bench,
and two upon the Foot-&s;tep; the <HI>Thalamites</HI> and <HI>Thramites</HI> &s;at next the &s;ide
of the Ve&s;&s;el, and the <HI>Zygites</HI> next within them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hepteres</HI> had all the Men &s;itting or &s;tanding in one Rank, and at one
Height, but that Rank a little &s;loped, to let the Oars have free pa&s;&s;age one
by another.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of a greater number of Rowers in an order, had both &s;everal &s;tati|ons
of Seats and &s;everal Men upon each Seat; as the <HI>Dekeres</HI> might have three
a&s;cents of Seats, and have three Rowers on the lowe&s;t, three on the next, and
four on the highe&s;t Bench: But the&s;e are but Conjectures, as are, for the mo&s;t
part, all the other above the <HI>Triremes,</HI> there being nothing that I have yet
met with in the Writings of the Antient Hi&s;torians, or in the <HI>Ba&s;&s;o Rilievos</HI>
now remaining that can clear that Doubt. But certain it is, that by this way
of Rowing, as great a number of Men may conveniently enough be plac'd to
manage each his Oar; and thereupon exert his own &s;trength for the promo|ting
of the Ship, as are Recorded to have been made u&s;e of by the Antients,
which I conceive cannot be done by any other way of Rowing yet known.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not now in&s;i&s;t upon the great u&s;e there may be made of this Princi|ple
in Shipping, but only hint, that how &s;light &s;oever it may at fir&s;t appear,
it may po&s;&s;ibly be prov'd to be of as great concern to <HI>England,</HI> as any thing
hitherto done in Shipping.</P>
