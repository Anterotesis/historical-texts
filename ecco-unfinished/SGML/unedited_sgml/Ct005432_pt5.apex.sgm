<HEAD>A LETTER TO THE PUBLISHER, Occa&s;ioned by the fir&s;t correct Edition of the DUNCIAD.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with plea&s;ure I hear, that you have pro|cured a correct copy of the DUNCIAD, which the many &s;urreptitious ones have rendered &s;o nece&s;&s;ary; and it is yet with more, that I am in|formed it will be attended with a COMMENTARY: A Work &s;o requi&s;ite, that I cannot think the Au|thor him&s;elf would have omitted it, had he ap|proved of the fir&s;t appearance of this Poem.</P>
<P>Such <HI>Notes</HI> as have occurred to me I herewith &s;end you: You will oblige me by in&s;erting them among&s;t tho&s;e which are, or will be, tran&s;mitted to you by others; &s;ince not only the Author's
<PB N="iv" REF="10">
friends, but even &s;trangers, appear engaged by hu|manity, to take &s;ome care of an Orphan of &s;o much genius and &s;pirit, which its parent &s;eems to have abandoned from the very beginning, and &s;uf|fered to &s;tep into the world naked, unguarded, and unattended.</P>
<P>It was upon reading &s;ome of the abu&s;ive papers lately publi&s;hed, that my great regard to a Per&s;on, who&s;e Friend&s;hip I e&s;teem as one of the chief ho|nours of my life, and a much greater re&s;pect to Truth, than to him or any man living, engaged me in enquiries, of which the inclo&s;ed <HI>Notes</HI> are the fruit.</P>
<P>I perceived, that mo&s;t of the&s;e Authors had been (doubtle&s;s very wi&s;ely) the fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;ors. They had tried, 'till they were weary, what was to be got by railing at each other: Nobody was either concerned or &s;urprized, if this or that &s;cri|bler was proved a dunce. But every one was cu|rious to read what could be &s;aid to prove Mr. POPE one, and was ready to pay &s;omething for &s;uch a di&s;covery: A &s;tratagem, which would they fairly own, it might not only reconcile them to me, but &s;creen them from the re&s;entment of their lawful Superiors, whom they daily abu&s;e, only (as I cha|ritably hope) to get that <HI>by</HI> them, which they can|not get <HI>from</HI> them.</P>
<P>I found this was not all: Ill &s;ucce&s;s in that had tran&s;ported them to Per&s;onal abu&s;e, either of him|&s;elf, or (what I think he could le&s;s forgive) of his
<PB N="v" REF="11">
Friends. They had called Men of virtue and ho|nour bad Men, long before he had either lei&s;ure or inclination to call them bad Writers: And &s;ome had been &s;uch old offenders, that he had quite forgot|ten their per&s;ons as well as their &s;landers, 'till they were plea&s;ed to revive them.</P>
<P>Now what had Mr. POPE done before, to in|cen&s;e them? He had publi&s;hed tho&s;e works which are in the hands of every body, in which not the lea&s;t mention is made of any of them. And what has he done &s;ince? He has laughed, and written the DUNCIAD. What has that &s;aid of them? A very &s;erious truth, which the public had &s;aid be|fore, that they were dull: And what it had no &s;ooner &s;aid, but they them&s;elves were at great pains to procure, or even purcha&s;e room in the prints, to te&s;tify under their hands to the truth of it.</P>
<P>I &s;hould &s;till have been &s;ilent, if either I had &s;een any inclination in my friend to be &s;erious with &s;uch accu&s;ers, or if they had only meddled with his Writ|ings; &s;ince whoever publi&s;hes, puts him&s;elf on his trial by his Country. But when his Moral cha|racter was attacked, and in a manner from which neither truth nor virtue can &s;ecure the mo&s;t inno|cent, in a manner, which, though it annihilates the credit of the accu&s;ation with the ju&s;t and im|partial, yet aggravates very much the guilt of the accu&s;ers; I mean by Authors <HI>without names;</HI> then I thought, &s;ince the danger was common to all, the concern ought to be &s;o; and that it was an act
<PB N="vi" REF="12">
of ju&s;tice to detect the Authors, not only on this account, but as many of them are the &s;ame who for &s;everal years pa&s;t have made free with the great|e&s;t names in Church and State, expo&s;ed to the world the private misfortunes of Families, abu&s;ed all, even to Women, and who&s;e pro&s;tituted papers (for one or other Party, in the unhappy divi&s;ions of their Country) have in&s;ulted the Fallen, the Friendle&s;s, the Exil'd, and the Dead.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, which I take to be a public con|cern, I have already confe&s;&s;ed I had a private one. I am one of that number who have long loved and e&s;teemed Mr. POPE; and had often declared it was not his capacity or writings (which we ever thought the lea&s;t valuable part of his character) but the hone&s;t, open, and beneficent man, that we mo&s;t e&s;teemed, and loved in him. Now, if what the&s;e people &s;ay were believed, I mu&s;t appear to all my friends either a fool, or a knave; either im|po&s;ed on my&s;elf, or impo&s;ing on them; &s;o that I am as much intere&s;ted in the confutation of the&s;e calumnies, as he is him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am no Author, and con&s;equently not to be &s;u&s;pected either of jealou&s;y or re&s;entment again&s;t any of the Men, of whom &s;carce one is known to me by &s;ight; and as for their Writings, I have &s;ought them (on this one occa&s;ion) in vain, in the clo&s;ets and libraries of all my acquaintance. I had &s;till been in the dark, if a Gentleman had not procured me (I &s;uppo&s;e from &s;ome of them&s;elves,
<PB N="vii" REF="13">
for they are generally much more dangerous friends than enemies) the pa&s;&s;ages I &s;end you. I &s;olemn|ly prote&s;t I have added nothing to the malice or ab&s;urdity of them; which it behoves me to de|clare, &s;ince the vouchers them&s;elves will be &s;o &s;oon and &s;o irrecoverably lo&s;t. You may in &s;ome mea|&s;ure prevent it, by pre&s;erving at lea&s;t their Titles ^a, and di&s;covering (as far as you can depend on the truth of your information) the Names of the con|cealed authors.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t objection I have heard made to the Poem is, that the per&s;ons are too <HI>ob&s;cure</HI> for &s;atire. The per&s;ons them&s;elves, rather than allow the objection, would forgive the &s;atire; and if one could be tempted to afford it a &s;erious an&s;wer, were not all a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inates, popular in&s;urrections, the in|&s;olence of the rabble without doors, and of dome&s;|tics within, mo&s;t wrongfully cha&s;ti&s;ed, if the Mean|ne&s;s of offenders indemnified them from puni&s;h|ment? On the contrary, Ob&s;curity renders them more dangerous, as le&s;s thought of: Law can pro|nounce judgment only on open facts; Morality a|lone can pa&s;s cen&s;ure on intentions of mi&s;chief; &s;o that for &s;ecret calumny, or the arrow flying in the dark, there is no public puni&s;hment left, but what a good Writer inflicts.</P>
<P>The next objection is, that the&s;e &s;ort of authors are <HI>poor.</HI> That might be pleaded as an excu&s;e at <NOTE PLACE="foot">1 Which we have done in a Li&s;t printed in the Appendix.</NOTE>
<PB N="viii" REF="14">
the Old Baily, for le&s;&s;er crimes than Defamation, (for 'tis the ca&s;e of almo&s;t all who are tried there) but &s;ure it can be none: For who will pretend that the robbing another of his Reputation &s;upplies the want of it in him&s;elf? I que&s;tion not but &s;uch au|thors are poor, and heartily wi&s;h the objection were removed by any hone&s;t livelihood. But Poverty is here the accident, not the &s;ubject: He who de|&s;cribes Malice and Villany to be pale and meagre, expre&s;&s;es not the lea&s;t anger again&s;t Palene&s;s or Leanne&s;s, but again&s;t Malice and Villany. The Apothecary in Romeo and Juliet is poor; but is he therefore ju&s;tified in vending poi&s;on? Not but Poverty it&s;elf becomes a ju&s;t &s;ubject of &s;atire, when it is the con&s;equence of vice, prodigality, or neg|lect of one's lawful calling; for then it increa&s;es the public burden, fills the &s;treets and highways with Robbers, and the garrets with Clippers, Coiners, and Weekly Journali&s;ts.</P>
<P>But admitting that two or three of the&s;e offend le&s;s in their morals, than in their writings; mu&s;t Poverty make non&s;en&s;e &s;acred? If &s;o, the fame of bad au|thors would be much better con&s;ulted than that of all the good ones in the world; and not one of an hundred had ever been called by his right name.</P>
<P>They mi&s;take the whole matter: It is not cha|rity to encourage them in the way they follow, but to get them out of it; for men are not bung|lers becau&s;e they are poor, but they are poor be|cau&s;e they are bunglers.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="15">
Is it not plea&s;ant enough, to hear our authors crying out on the one hand, as if their per&s;ons and characters were too &s;acred for Satire; and the pub|lic objecting on the other, that they are too mean even for Ridicule? But whether Bread or Fame be their end, it mu&s;t be allowed, our author, by and in this Poem, has mercifully given them a little of both.</P>
<P>There are two or three, who by their rank and fortune have no benefit from the former objec|tions, &s;uppo&s;ing them good, and the&s;e I was &s;orry to &s;ee in &s;uch company. But if, without any pro|vocation, two or three Gentlemen will fall upon one, in an affair wherein his intere&s;t and reputa|tion are equally embarked; they cannot certainly, after they have been content to print them&s;elves his enemies, complain of being put into the number of them.</P>
<P>Others, I am told, pretend to have been once his Friends. Surely they are their enemies who &s;ay &s;o, &s;ince nothing can be more odious than to treat a friend as they have done. But of this I can|not per&s;uade my&s;elf, when I con&s;ider the con&s;tant and eternal aver&s;ion of all bad writers to a good one.</P>
<P>Such as claim a merit from being his Admirers I would gladly a&s;k, if it lays him under a per&s;o|nal obligation? At that rate he would be the mo&s;t obliged humble &s;ervant in the world. I dare &s;wear for the&s;e in particular, he never de&s;ired them to be his
<PB N="x" REF="16">
admirers, nor promi&s;ed in return to be theirs: That had truly been a &s;ign he was of their acquaintance; but would not the malicious world have &s;u&s;pected &s;uch an approbation of &s;ome motive wor&s;e than ignorance, in the author of the E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m? Be it as it will, the rea&s;ons of their Admiration and of his Contempt are equally &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, for his works and theirs are the very &s;ame that they were.</P>
<P>One, therefore, of their a&s;&s;ertions I believe may be true, <Q>&startq;That he has a contempt for their writ|ings.&endq;</Q> And there is another, which would pro|bably be &s;ooner allowed by him&s;elf than by any good judge be&s;ide, <Q>&startq;That his own have found too much &s;ucce&s;s with the public.&endq;</Q> But as it cannot con|&s;i&s;t with his mode&s;ty to claim this as a ju&s;tice, it lies not on him, but entirely on the public, to de|fend its own judgment.</P>
<P>There remains what in my opinion might &s;eem a better plea for the&s;e people, than any they have made u&s;e of. If Ob&s;curity or Poverty were to ex|empt a man from &s;atire, much more &s;hould Folly or Dulne&s;s, which are &s;till more involuntary; nay, as much &s;o as per&s;onal Deformity. But even this will not help them: Deformity becomes an object of Ridicule when a man &s;ets up for being hand|&s;ome; and &s;o mu&s;t Dulne&s;s when he &s;ets up for a Wit. They are not ridiculed becau&s;e Ridicule in it&s;elf is, or ought to be, a plea&s;ure; but becau&s;e it is ju&s;t to undeceive and vindicate the hone&s;t and unpretending part of mankind from impo&s;ition, be|cause
<PB N="xi" REF="17">
particular intere&s;t ought to yield to general, and a great number who are not naturally Fools, ought never to be made &s;o, in complai&s;ance to a few who are. Accordingly we find that in all ages, all vain pretenders, were they ever &s;o poor or ever &s;o dull, have been con&s;tantly the topics of the mo&s;t candid &s;atiri&s;ts, from the Codrus of JU|VENAL to the Damon of BOILEAU.</P>
<P>Having mentioned BOILEAU, the greate&s;t Poet and mo&s;t judicious Critic of his age and country, admirable for his Talents, and yet perhaps more admirable for his Judgment in the proper applica|tion of them; I cannot help remarking the re|&s;emblance betwixt him and our author, in Quali|ties, Fame, and Fortune; in the di&s;tinctions &s;hewn them by their Superiors, in the general e&s;teem of their Equals, and in their extended reputation a|mong&s;t Foreigners; in the latter of which ours has met with the better fate, as he has had for his Tran&s;lators per&s;ons of the mo&s;t eminent rank and abilities in their re&s;pective nations <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on Crititi&s;m, in French ver&s;e, by General Ha|milton; the &s;ame, in ver&s;e al|&s;o, by Mon&s;ieur Roboton, Coun&s;ellor and Privy Secretary to King George I. after by the Abb&eacute; Reynel, in ver&s;e, with notes. Rape of the Lock, in French, by the Prince&s;s of Con|ti, Paris 1728. and in Italian ver&s;e, by the Abb&eacute; Conti, a Noble Venetian; and by the Marquis Rangoni, Envoy Ex|traordinary from Modena to King George II. Others of his works by Salvini of Florence, &amp;c. His E&s;&s;ays and Di&s;&s;erta|tions on Homer, &s;everal times tran&s;lated in French. E&s;&s;ay on Man, by the Abb&eacute; Reynel, in ver&s;e; by Mon&s;ieur Silhouet, in pro&s;e, 1737. and &s;ince by others in French, Italian, and Latin.</NOTE>. But the re|&s;emblance
<PB N="xii" REF="18">
holds in nothing more, than in their being equally abu&s;ed by the ignorant pretenders to Poetry of their times; of which not the lea&s;t me|mory will remain but in their own Writings, and in the Notes made upon them. What BOILEAU has done in almo&s;t all his poems, our author has only in this: I dare an&s;wer for him he will do it in no more; and on this principle, of attacking few but who had &s;landered him, he could not have done it at all, had he been confined from cen&s;uring ob&s;cure and worthle&s;s per&s;ons, for &s;carce any other were his enemies. However, as the parity is &s;o remarkable, I hope it will continue to the la&s;t; and if ever he &s;hall give us an edition of this Poem him&s;elf, I may &s;ee &s;ome of them treated as gently, on their repentance or better merit, as Perrault and Quinault were at la&s;t by BOILEAU.</P>
<P>In one point I mu&s;t be allowed to think the cha|racter of our Engli&s;h Poet the more amiable. He has not been a follower of Fortune or Succe&s;s; he has lived with the Great without flattery; been a friend to Men in power, without pen&s;ions, from whom, as he a&s;ked, &s;o he received no favour, but what was done Him in his Friends. As his Satires were the more ju&s;t for being delayed, &s;o were his Panegyrics; be&s;towed only on &s;uch per|&s;ons as he had familiarly known, only for &s;uch virtues as he had long ob&s;erved in them, and only at &s;uch times as others cea&s;e to prai&s;e, if not begin
<PB N="xiii" REF="19">
to calumniate them, I mean when out of power or out of fa&s;hion <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">As Mr. Wycherly, at the time the Town declaimed a|gain&s;t his book of Poems; Mr. Wal&s;h, after his death; Sir William Trumbull, when he had re&s;igned the Office of Secretary of State; Lord Bo|lingbroke, at his leaving Eng|land after the Queen's death; Lord Oxford in his la&s;t decline of life; Mr. Secretary Craggs, at the end of the South-Sea year, and after his death: Others only in Epitaphs.</NOTE>. A &s;atire, therefore, on writers &s;o notorious for the contrary practice, became no man &s;o well as him&s;elf; as none, it is plain, was &s;o little in their friend&s;hips, or &s;o much in that of tho&s;e whom they had mo&s;t abu&s;ed, namely the Greate&s;t and Be&s;t of all Parties. Let me add a further rea&s;on, that, though engaged in their Friend&s;hips, he never e&s;pou&s;ed their Animo&s;ities; and can almo&s;t &s;ingly challenge this honour, not to have written a line of any man, which, through Guilt, through Shame, or through Fear, through variety of Fortune, or change of Intere&s;ts, he was ever unwilling to own.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with remarking what a plea|&s;ure it mu&s;t be to every reader of Humanity, to &s;ee all along, that our Author in his very laughter is not indulging his own ill-nature, but only pu|ni&s;hing that of others. As to his Poem, tho&s;e a|lone are capable of doing it ju&s;tice, who, to u&s;e the words of a great writer, know how hard it is (with regard both to his &s;ubject and his manner) VETUSTIS DARE NOVITATEM, OBSOLETIS NI|TOREM,</P>

<SPEAKER>M. SCRIBLERUS Lectori S.</SPEAKER>
<P>BEFORE we pre&s;ent thee with our exerci|tations on this mo&s;t delectable Poem (drawn from the many volumes of our Adver&s;aria on modern Authors) we &s;hall here, according to the lau|dable u&s;age of editors, collect the various judgments of the Learned concerning our Poet: Various indeed, not only of different authors, but of the &s;ame author at different &s;ea&s;ons. Nor &s;hall we gather only the Te&s;timonies of &s;uch eminent Wits, as would of cour&s;e de&s;cend to po&s;terity, and con&s;equently be read with|out our collection; but we &s;hall likewi&s;e with incredible labour &s;eek out for divers others, which, but for this our diligence, could never at the di&s;tance of a few months appear to the eye of the mo&s;t curious. Here|by thou may'&s;t not only receive the delectation of Va|riety, but al&s;o arrive at a more certain judgment, by a grave and circum&s;pect compari&s;on of the Witne&s;&s;es with each other, or of each with him&s;elf. Hence al&s;o thou wilt be enabled to draw reflections, not only of a critical, but a moral nature, by being let into many
<PB N="xx" REF="25">
particulars of the Per&s;on as well as Genius, and of the Fortune as well as Merit, of our Author: In which if I relate &s;ome things of little concern peradventure to thee, and &s;ome of as little even to him; I entreat thee to con&s;ider how minutely all true critics and commen|tators are wont to in&s;i&s;t upon &s;uch, and how material they &s;eem to them&s;elves, if to none other. Forgive me, gentle reader, if (following learned example) I ever and anon become tedious: allow me to take the &s;ame pains to find whether my author were good or bad, well or ill-natured, mode&s;t or arrogant; as another, whether his author was fair or brown, &s;hort or tall, or whether he wore a coat or a ca&s;&s;ock.</P>
<P>We purpo&s;ed to begin with his Life, Parentage, and Education: But as to the&s;e, even his cotemporaries do exceedingly differ. One &s;aith <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Giles Jacob's Lives of Poets, vol. ii. in his Life.</NOTE>, he was educated at home; another <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Dennis's Reflect. on the E&s;|&s;ay on Crit.</NOTE>, that he was bred at St. Omer's by Je&s;uits; a third <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Dunciad di&s;&s;ected, p. 4.</NOTE>, not at St. Omer's, but at Oxford; a fourth <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Guardian, No 40.</NOTE>, that he had no Univer&s;ity education at all. Tho&s;e who allow him to be bred at home, differ as much concerning his Tutor: One &s;aith <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Jacob's Lives, &amp;c. vol. ii.</NOTE>, he was kept by his father on purpo&s;e; a &s;econd <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Dunciad di&s;&s;ected, p. 4.</NOTE>, that he was an itinerant prie&s;t; a third <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Farmer P. and his &s;on.</NOTE>, that he was a par&s;on; one<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Dunc. di&s;&s;ect.</NOTE> calleth him a &s;ecular clergyman of the Church of Rome; another <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Characters of the times, p. 45.</NOTE>, a monk.

writer. They are &s;ome of them <HI>uncommon,</HI> but &s;uch as the reader mu&s;t a&s;&s;ent to, when he &s;ees them explain'd with that ea&s;e and per&s;picuity in which they are delivered.

And here give me leave to mention what Mon&s;ieur Boileau has &s;o well enlarged upon in the preface to his works: That wit and fine writing doth not con&s;i&s;t &s;o much in advancing things that are new, as in giving things that are known an agreeable turn. It is impo&s;&s;ible for us who live in the latter ages of the world, to make ob&s;ervations in critici&s;m, morality, or any art or &s;cience, which have not been touch'd upon by others; we have little el&s;e left us, but to repre&s;ent the common &s;en&s;e of mankind in more &s;trong, more beautiful, or more uncommon lights. If a reader examines Horace's Art of Poe|try, he will find but few precepts in it, which he may not meet with in Ari&s;totle, and which were not commonly known by all the poets of the Augu&s;tan age. His way of expre&s;&s;ing, and applying them, not his invention of them, is what we are chiefly to admire.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Longinus, in his Reflexions, has given us the &s;ame kind of &s;ublime, which he ob&s;erves in the &s;e|veral pa&s;&s;ages that occa&s;ioned them: I cannot but take notice that our Engli&s;h author has after the &s;ame manner exemplified &s;everal of the precepts in the very precepts them&s;elves.&endq;</Q> He then produces &s;ome in&s;tances of a particular beauty in the numbers, and concludes with &s;aying, that <Q>&startq;there are three poems in our tongue of the &s;ame nature, and each a ma&s;ter-piece in its kind; The E&s;&s;ay on Tran&s;|lated

<P><Q>&startq;<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Daily Journal, April 3, 1728.</NOTE> The Memoirs of a Pari&s;h clerk was a very dull and unju&s;t abu&s;e of a per&s;on who wrote in defence of our Religion and Con&s;titution, and who has been dead many years.&endq;</Q> This &s;eemeth al&s;o mo&s;t untrue; it being known to divers that the&s;e Memoirs were writ|ten at the &s;eat of the Lord Harcourt in Oxford&s;hire, before that excellent per&s;on (bi&s;hop Burnet's) death, and many years before the appearance of that hi&s;tory, of which they are pretended to be an abu&s;e.

<P>However contradictory this may appear, Mr. Den|nis and Gildon, in the character la&s;t cited, make it all plain, by a&s;&s;uring us, <Q>&startq;That he is a creature that reconciles all contradictions; he is a bea&s;t, and a man; a Whig, and a Tory; a writer (at one and the &s;ame time) of<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The Names of two weekly Papers.</NOTE> Guardians and Examiners; an A&s;&s;ertor of liberty, and of the di&s;pen&s;ing power of kings; a Je&s;uitical profe&s;&s;or of truth; a ba&s;e and a foul pretender to candour.&endq;</Q> So that, upon the whole account, we mu&s;t conclude him either to have been a great hypocrite, or a very hone&s;t man; a terrible im|po&s;er upon both parties, or very moderate to either.</P>

<HEAD>MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS Of the POEM.</HEAD>
<P>THIS poem, as it celebrateth the mo&s;t grave and ancient of things, Chaos, Night, and Dul|ne&s;s; &s;o is it of the mo&s;t grave and ancient kind. Homer (&s;aith Ari&s;totle) was the fir&s;t who gave the <HI>Form,</HI> and (&s;aith Horace) who adapted the <HI>Mea|&s;ure,</HI> to heroic poe&s;y. But even before this, may be rationally pre&s;umed from what the Ancients have left written, was a piece by Homer compo&s;ed, of like na|ture and matter with this of our poet. For of Epic &s;ort it appeareth to have been, yet of matter &s;urely not unplea&s;ant, witne&s;s what is reported of it by the learn|ed archbi&s;hop Eu&s;tathius, in Ody&s;&s;. x. And accord|ingly Ari&s;totle, in his Poetic, chap. iv. doth further &s;et forth, that as the Iliad and Ody&s;&s;ey gave example to Tragedy, &s;o did this poem to Comedy its fir&s;t idea.</P>
<P>From the&s;e authors al&s;o it &s;hould &s;eem, that the Hero&punc; or chief per&s;onage of it was no le&s;s <HI>ob&s;cure,</HI> and his un|der&s;tanding and &s;entiments no le&s;s quaint and &s;trange (if indeed not more &s;o) than any of the actors of our poem. MARGITES was the name of this per&s;onage, whom Antiquity recordeth to have been <HI>Dunce the first;</HI> and &s;urely from what we hear of him, not unworthy to be the root of &s;o &s;preading a tree, and &s;o numerous a po&s;terity. The poem therefore celebrating him was pro|perly and ab&s;olutely a <HI>Dunciad;</HI> which though now un|happily lo&s;t, yet is its nature &s;ufficiently known by the
<PB N="xliv" REF="49">
infallible tokens afore&s;aid. And thus it doth appear, that the fir&s;t Dunciad was the fir&s;t Epic poem, written by Homer him&s;elf, and anterior even to the Iliad or Ody&s;&s;ey.</P>
<P>Now, fora&s;much as our poet had tran&s;lated tho&s;e two famous works of Homer which are yet left, he did con|ceive it in &s;ome &s;ort his duty to imitate that al&s;o which was lo&s;t: And was therefore induced to be&s;tow on it the &s;ame form which Homer's is reported to have had, namely that of Epic poem; with a title al&s;o framed after the ancient Greek manner, to wit, that of <HI>Dun|ciad.</HI></P>
<P>Wonderful it is, that &s;o few of the moderns have been &s;timulated to attempt &s;ome Dunciad! &s;ince, in the opinion of the multitude, it might co&s;t le&s;s pain and oil than an imitation of the greater Epic. But po&s;&s;ible it is al&s;o, that, on due reflection, the maker might find it ea&s;ier to paint a Charlemagne, a Brute, or a God|frey, with ju&s;t pomp and dignity heroic, than a Mar|gites, a Codrus, or a Fleckno.</P>
<P>We &s;hall next declare the occa&s;ion and the cau&s;e which moved our poet to this particular work. He lived in tho&s;e days, when (after Providence had per|mitted the invention of Printing as a &s;courge for the &s;ins of the learned) Paper al&s;o became &s;o cheap, and Printers &s;o numerous, that a deluge of Authors cover|ed the land: Whereby not only the peace of the hone&s;t unwriting &s;ubject was daily mole&s;ted, but unmerciful demands were made of his applau&s;e, yea of his money, by &s;uch as would neither earn the one, nor de&s;erve the other. At the &s;ame time, the licence of the Pre&s;s was &s;uch, that it grew dangerous to refu&s;e them either: for they would forthwith publi&s;h &s;landers unpuni&s;hed, the authors being anonymous, and &s;kulking under the wings of Publi&s;hers, a &s;et of men who never &s;crupled to vend either Calumny or Bla&s;phemy, as long as the Town would call for it.</P>

<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vide Bo&s;&s;u, Du Poeme E|pique, ch. viii.</NOTE> Now our author, living in tho&s;e times, did con|ceive it an endeavour well worthy an hone&s;t Satiri&s;t, to di&s;&s;uade the dull, and puni&s;h the wicked, <HI>the only way that was left.</HI> In that public-&s;pirited view he laid the plan of this Poem, as the greate&s;t &s;ervice he was capa|ble (without much hurt, or being &s;lain) to render his dear country. Fir&s;t, taking things from their original, he con&s;idereth the cau&s;es creative of &s;uch Authors, namely <HI>Dulne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Poverty;</HI> the one born with them, the other contracted by neglect of their proper talents, through &s;elf-conceit of greater abilities.

The great power of the&s;e Godde&s;&s;es acting in alliance (whereof as the one is the mother of Indu|&s;try, &s;o is the other of Plodding) was to be exemplified in &s;ome <HI>one, great</HI> and <HI>remarkable Action</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. chap. vii, viii.</NOTE>: And none could be more &s;o than that which our poet hath cho&s;en, <HI>viz.</HI> the re&s;toration of the reign of Chaos and Night, by the mini&s;try of Dulne&s;s their daughter, in the re|moval of her imperial &s;eat from the City to the polite World; as the Action of the Aeneid is the re&s;toration of the empire of Troy, by the removal of the race from thence to Latium. But as Homer &s;inging only the <HI>Wrath</HI> of Achilles, yet includes in his poem the whole
<PB N="xlvi" REF="51">
hi&s;tory of the Trojan war; in like manner our author hath drawn into this <HI>&s;ingle Action</HI> the whole hi&s;tory of Dulne&s;s and her children.</P>
<P>A <HI>Per&s;on</HI> mu&s;t next be fixed upon to &s;upport this Action. This <HI>Phantom</HI> in the poet's mind mu&s;t have a <HI>Name</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Bo&s;&s;u, chap. viii. Vide Ari&s;tot Poetic. cap ix.</NOTE>: He finds it to be&mdash;; and he becomes of cour&s;e the Hero of the poem.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fable</HI> being thus, according to the be&s;t exam|ple, one and entire, as contained in the Propo&s;ition; the <HI>Machinery</HI> is a continued chain of Allegories, &s;et|ting forth the whole Power, Mini&s;try, and Empire of Dulne&s;s, extended through her &s;ubordinate in&s;truments, in all her various operations.</P>
<P>This is branched into <HI>Epi&s;odes,</HI> each of which hath its Moral apart, though all conducive to the main end. The Crowd a&s;&s;embled in the &s;econd book, demon&s;trates the de&s;ign to be more exten&s;ive than to bad poets only, and that we may expect other Epi&s;odes of the Patrons, Encouragers, or Payma&s;ters of &s;uch authors, as occa|&s;ion &s;hall bring them forth. And the third book, if well con&s;idered, &s;eemeth to embrace the whole World. Each of the Games relateth to &s;ome or other vile cla&s;s of writers: The fir&s;t concerneth the plagiary, to whom he giveth the name of More; the &s;econd the libellous Novelli&s;t, whom he &s;tyleth Eliza; the third, the flat|tering Dedicator; the fourth, the bawling Critic, or noi&s;y Poet; the fifth, the dark and dirty Party-writer; and &s;o of the re&s;t; a&s;&s;igning to each &s;ome <HI>proper name</HI> or other, &s;uch as he could find.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Characters,</HI> the public hath already ac|knowledged how ju&s;tly they are drawn: The manners are &s;o depicted, and the &s;entiments &s;o peculiar to tho&s;e to whom applied, that &s;urely to transfer them to any other or wi&s;er per&s;onages, would be exceeding diffi|cult: And certain it is, that every per&s;on concerned, being con&s;ulted apart, hath readily owned the re&s;em|blance

<P>The <HI>De&s;criptions</HI> are &s;ingular, the <HI>Compari&s;ons</HI> very quaint, the <HI>Narration</HI> various, yet of one colour: The purity and cha&s;tity of <HI>Diction</HI> is &s;o pre&s;erved, that in the places mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious, not the <HI>words</HI> but only the <HI>images</HI> have been cen&s;ured, and yet are tho&s;e images no other than have been &s;anctified by ancient and cla&s;|&s;ical Authority (though, as was the manner of tho&s;e good times, not &s;o curiou&s;ly wrapped up) yea, and commented upon by the mo&s;t grave Doctors, and ap|proved Critics.</P>
<P>As it beareth the name of <HI>Epic,</HI> it is thereby &s;ub|jected to &s;uch &s;evere indi&s;pen&s;able rules as are laid on all Neoterics, a &s;trict imitation of the Ancients; in&s;omuch that any deviation, accompanied with whatever poetic beauties, hath always been cen&s;ured by the &s;ound Cri|tic. How exact that Imitation hath been in this piece, appeareth not only by its general &s;tructure, but by par|ticular allu&s;ions infinite, many whereof have e&s;caped both the commentator and poet him&s;elf; yea divers by his exceeding diligence are &s;o altered and inter|woven with the re&s;t, that &s;everal have already been, and more will be, by the ignorant abu&s;ed, as altogether and originally his own.</P>
<P>In a word, the whole poem proveth it&s;elf to be the work of our Author, when his faculties were in full vi|gour and perfection; at that exact time when years have ripened the Judgment, without dimini&s;hing the Ima|gination: which, by good Critics, is held to be punc|tually at <HI>forty.</HI> For, at that &s;ea&s;on it was that Virgil fini&s;hed his Georgics; and Sir Richard Blackmore at

<HEAD>RICARDUS ARISTARCHUS OF THE HERO of the POEM.</HEAD>
<P>OF the Nature of <HI>Dunciad</HI> in general, whence derived, and on what authority founded, as well as of the art and conduct of this our poem in particular, the learned and laborious Scriblerus hath, according to his manner, and with tolerable &s;hare of judgment, di&s;&s;ertated. But when he cometh to &s;peak of the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> of the <HI>Hero</HI> fitted for &s;uch poem, in truth he mi&s;erably halts and hallucinates. For, mi&s;led by one Mon&s;ieur Bo&s;&s;u, a Gallic critic, he prateth of I cannot tell what Phantom of a Hero, only rai&s;ed up to &s;upport the Fable. A putid conceit! As if Homer and Virgil, like modern Undertakers, who fir&s;t build their hou&s;e, and then &s;eek out for a tenant, had contrived the &s;tory of a War and a Wandering, before they once thought either of Achilles or Aeneas. We &s;hall therefore &s;et our good brother and the world al&s;o right in this particular, by a&s;&s;uring them, that, in the greater Epic, the prime intention of the Mu&s;e is to exalt Heroic Virtue, in or|der to propagate the love of it among the <HI>children</HI> of men; and con&s;equently that the Poet's fir&s;t thought mu&s;t needs be turned upon a real &s;ubject meet for laud and celebration; not one whom he is to make, but one whom he may find, truly illu&s;trious. This is the pri|mum
<PB N="l" REF="55">
mobile of his poetic world, whence every thing is to receive life and motion. For this &s;ubject being found, he is immediately ordained, or rather acknowledged, an <HI>Hero,</HI> and put upon &s;uch action as befitteth the dignity of his character.</P>
<P>But the Mu&s;e cea&s;eth not here her Eagle-flight. For &s;ometimes, &s;atiated with the contemplation of the&s;e <HI>Suns</HI> of glory, &s;he turneth downward on her wing, and darts with Jove's lightning on the <HI>Goo&s;e</HI> and <HI>Serpent</HI> kind. For we may apply to the Mu&s;e in her various moods, what an ancient ma&s;ter of Wi&s;dom affirmeth of the Gods in general: <HI>Si Dii non ira&s;cuntur impiis et inju&s;tis, nec pios utique ju&s;to&s;que diligunt. In rebus enim diver&s;is, aut in utramque partem moveri nece&s;&s;e est, aut in neutram. Itaque qui bonos diligit, et malos odit; et qui malos non odit, nec bonos diligit. Quia et diligere bonos ex odio ma|lorum venit; et malos odi&s;&s;e ex bonorum caritate de&s;cendit.</HI> Which in our vernacular idiom may be thus interpret|ed: <Q>&startq;If the Gods be not provoked at evil men, nei|ther are they delighted with the good and ju&s;t. For contrary objects mu&s;t either excite contrary affections, or no affections at all. So that he who loveth good men, mu&s;t at the &s;ame time hate the bad; and he who hateth not bad men, cannot love the good; becau&s;e to love good men proceedeth from an aver&s;ion to evil, and to hate evil men from a tenderne&s;s to the good.&endq;</Q> From this delicacy of the Mu&s;e aro&s;e the <HI>lit|tle Epic,</HI> (more lively and choleric than her elder &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e bulk and complexion incline her to the flegmatic) and for this &s;ome notorious Vehicle of vice and folly was &s;ought out, to make thereof an example. An ear|ly in&s;tance of which (nor could it e&s;cape the accurate Scriblerus) the Father of Epic poem him&s;elf affordeth us. From him the practice de&s;cended to the Greek Dramatic poets, his offspring; who in the compo&s;ition of their <HI>Tetralogy,</HI> or &s;et of four pieces, were wont to make the la&s;t a <HI>Satiric Tragedy.</HI> Happily one of the&s;e

Hence, to the advantage of our Dunciad, we may ob|&s;erve how much ju&s;ter the <HI>Moral</HI> of that Poem mu&s;t needs be, where &s;o important a que&s;tion is previou&s;ly decided.</P>
<P>But then it is not every Knave, nor (let me add) every Fool, that is a fit &s;ubject for a Dunciad. There mu&s;t &s;till exi&s;t &s;ome Analogy, if not Re&s;emblance of Quali|ties, between the Heroes of the two Poems; and this in order to admit what Neoteric critics call the <HI>Parody,</HI> one of the livelie&s;t graces of the little Epic. Thus it being agreed, that the con&s;tituent qualities of the greater Epic Hero, are <HI>Wi&s;dom, Bravery,</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> from whence &s;pringeth <HI>heroic Virtue;</HI> it followeth, that tho&s;e of the le&s;&s;er Epic Hero, &s;hould be <HI>Vanity, Impudence,</HI> and <HI>De|bauchery,</HI>

<P>This being confe&s;&s;ed, come we now to particulars. It is the character of true <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> to &s;eek its chief &s;up|port and confidence within it&s;elf; and to place that &s;up|port in the re&s;ources which proceed from a con&s;cious rectitude of Will. And are the advantages of <HI>Vanity,</HI> when ari&s;ing to the heroic &s;tandard, at all &s;hort of this &s;elf-complacence? Nay, are they not, in the opinion of the enamoured owner, far beyond it? <Q>&startq;Let the world (will &s;uch an one &s;ay) impute to me what folly or weakne&s;s they plea&s;e; but till <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> can give me &s;omething that will make me more heartily happy, I am content to be GAZED AT <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Dedication to the Life of C.

I have pa&s;&s;ed my time very plea&s;antly with them <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Life, p. 2. octavo Ed.</NOTE>.&endq;</Q> In &s;hort, there is no &s;ort of Vanity &s;uch a Hero would &s;cruple, but that which might go near to degrade him from his high &s;ta|tion in this our Dunciad; namely, <Q>&startq;Whether it would not be <HI>Vanity</HI> in him, to take &s;hame to him&s;elf for <HI>not being a wi&s;e man</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Life, ibid.</NOTE>?&endq;</Q></P>
<P><HI>Bravery,</HI> the &s;econd attribute of the true Hero, is Courage manife&s;ting it&s;elf in every limb; while its cor|re&s;pondent virtue in the mock Hero, is, that &s;ame Courage all collected into the <HI>Face.</HI> And as Power when drawn together, mu&s;t needs have more force and &s;pirit than when di&s;per&s;ed, we generally find this kind of courage in &s;o high and heroic a degree, that it in&s;ults not only Men, but Gods.

<P><HI>Gentle Love,</HI> the next ingredient in the true Hero's compo&s;ition, is a mere bird of pa&s;&s;age, or as (Shake|&s;pear calls it) <HI>&s;ummer-teeming Lu&s;t,</HI> and evaporates in the heat of <HI>Youth;</HI> doubtle&s;s by that refinement it &s;uffers in pa&s;&s;ing through tho&s;e <HI>certain &s;trainers</HI> which our Poet &s;omewhere &s;peaketh of.

It is true indeed, there is one objection to its fitne&s;s for &s;uch an u&s;e: For not only the Ignorant may think it <HI>common,</HI> but it is admitted to be &s;o, even by Him who be&s;t knoweth its value. <Q>&startq;Don't you think (argueth he) to &s;ay only <HI>a man has his Whore</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Alluding to the&s;e lines in the Epi&s;t. to Dr. Arbuthnot,

<P>But here, in ju&s;tice both to the Poet and the Hero, let us farther remark, that the calling her <HI>his</HI> whore, im|plieth &s;he was <HI>his own,</HI> and not his <HI>neighbour</HI>'s. Truly a commendable Continence! and &s;uch as Scipio him&s;elf mu&s;t have applauded. For how much Self-denial was exerted not to covet his Neighbour's whore? and what di&s;orders mu&s;t the coveting her have occa&s;ioned in that Society, where (according to this Political Calculator) <HI>nine</HI> in <HI>ten</HI> of all ages have their <HI>concubines?</HI></P>
<P>We have now, as briefly as we could devi&s;e, gone through the three con&s;tituent Qualities of either Hero. But it is not in any, or in all of the&s;e, that Heroi&s;m pro|perly or e&s;&s;entially re&s;ideth. It is a lucky re&s;ult rather from the colli&s;ion of the&s;e lively Qualities again&s;t one another. Thus, as from Wi&s;dom, Bravery, and Love, ari&s;eth <HI>Magnanimity,</HI> the object of <HI>Admiration,</HI> which is the aim of the greater Epic; &s;o from Vanity, Impu|dence, and Debauchery, &s;pringeth <HI>Buffoonry,</HI> the &s;ource of <HI>Ridicule,</HI> that "laughing ornament," as he well termeth it <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Letter to Mr. P. p. 31.</NOTE>, of the little Epic.</P>
<P>He is not a&s;hamed (God forbid he ever &s;hould be a&s;hamed!) of this Character; who deemeth, that not <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> but <HI>Ri&s;ibility</HI> di&s;tingui&s;heth the human &s;pecies from the brutal. <Q>&startq;As Nature (&s;aith this profound Phi|lo&s;opher) di&s;tingui&s;hed our &s;pecies from the mute creation by our Ri&s;ibility, her de&s;ign MUST have been

<P>But whatever per&s;onal qualities a Hero may have, the examples of Achilles and Aeneas &s;hew us, that all tho&s;e are of &s;mall avail, without the con&s;tant <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the</HI> GODS: for the &s;ubver&s;ion and erection of Empires have never been adjudged the work of Man. How great|ly &s;oever then we may e&s;teem of his high talents, we can hardly conceive his per&s;onal prowe&s;s alone &s;ufficient to re&s;tore the decayed empire of Dulne&s;s. So weigh|ty an atchievement mu&s;t require the particular favour and protection of the GREAT: who being the natural patrons and &s;upporters of <HI>Letters,</HI> as the ancient Gods were of <HI>Troy,</HI> mu&s;t fir&s;t be drawn off and engaged in another Intere&s;t, before the total &s;ubver&s;ion of them can be accompli&s;hed. To &s;urmount, therefore, this la&s;t and greate&s;t difficulty, we have, in this excellent man, a profe&s;&s;ed Favourite and Intimado of the Great. And look, of what force ancient Piety was to draw the Gods into the party of Aeneas, that, and much &s;tronger is modern Incen&s;e, to engage the Great in the party of Dulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus have we e&s;&s;ayed to pourtray or &s;hadow out this noble Imp of Fame. But now the impatient reader will be apt to &s;ay, if &s;o many and various graces go to the making up a Hero, what mortal &s;hall &s;uffice to bear his character? Ill hath he read, who &s;eeth not, in every

<P>The good Scriblerus indeed, nay the World it&s;elf might be impo&s;ed on in the late &s;purious editions, by I can't tell what <HI>Sham-Hero,</HI> or <HI>Phantom:</HI> But it was not &s;o ea&s;y to impo&s;e on HIM whom this egregious error mo&s;t of all concerned. For no &s;ooner had the fourth book laid open the high and &s;welling &s;cene, but he recognized his own heroic Acts: And when he came to the words,
<Q><L>Soft on her lap her Laureat &s;on reclines,</L></Q>
(though <HI>Laureat</HI> imply no more than <HI>one crowned with laurel,</HI> as befitteth any A&s;&s;ociate or Con&s;ort in Empire) he loudly re&s;ented this indignity to violated Maje&s;ty. Indeed not without cau&s;e, he being there repre&s;ented as <HI>fast a&s;leep;</HI> &s;o mi&s;be&s;eeming the eye of Empire, which, like that of Providence, &s;hould never doze nor &s;lumber. <Q>&startq;Hah! (&s;aith he) fa&s;t a&s;leep, it &s;eems! that's a little too &s;trong.

But now, as nothing in this world, no not the mo&s;t &s;acred or perfect things either of Religion or Govern|ment, can e&s;cape the &s;ting of Envy, methinks I already hear the&s;e carpers objecting to the clearne&s;s of our Hero's title.</P>
<P>It would never (&s;ay they) have been e&s;teemed &s;uffi|cient to make an Hero for the Iliad or Aeneis, that Achilles was brave enough to overturn one Empire, or Aeneas pious enough to rai&s;e another, had they not been Godde&s;s-born, and Princes bred. What then did this Author mean, by erecting a Player in&s;tead of one of his Patrons, (a per&s;on "never a hero even on the &s;tage <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">See Life, p. 148.</NOTE>,") to this dignity of Collegue in the empire of Dulne&s;s, and Atchiever of a work that neither old Omar, Attila, nor John of Leiden could entirely bring to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>To all this we have, as we conceive, a &s;ufficient an|&s;wer from the Roman hi&s;torian, <HI>Fabrum e&s;&s;e &s;uae quemque fortunae: That every man is the</HI> Smith <HI>of his own fortune.</HI> The politic Florentine, Nicholas Machiavel, goeth &s;till farther, and affirmeth that a man needeth but to <HI>believe him|&s;elf a Hero</HI> to be one of the worthie&s;t. <Q>&startq;Let him (&s;aith he) but fancy him&s;elf capable of the highe&s;t things, and he will of cour&s;e be able to atchieve them.&endq;</Q> From this principle it follows, that nothing can exceed our Hero's prowe&s;s; as nothing ever equalled the great|ne&s;s of his conceptions.

<P>THE DUNCIAD.] It is an inconvenience, to which Writers of reputation are &s;ubject, that the Ju&s;tice of their re&s;entment is not always rightly under&s;tood. For the calumnies of dull Authors being &s;oon forgotten, and tho&s;e whom they aimed to injure, not caring to recall to memory the particulars of fal&s;e and &s;candalous abu&s;e, their nece&s;&s;ary correction is &s;u&s;pect|ed of &s;everity unprovoked. But, in this ca&s;e, it would be but candid to e&s;timate the cha&s;ti&s;ement on the general Character of the offender, compared with that of the Per&s;on injured. Let this &s;erve with the candid Reader, in ju&s;tification of the <HI>Poet;</HI> and, on occa&s;ion, of the <HI>Editor.</HI> <BIBL>W.</BIBL></P>
<P>The DUNCIAD, &s;ic MS. It may well be di&s;puted whether this be a right reading: Ought it not rather to be &s;pelled <HI>Dun|ceiad,</HI> as the Etymology evidently demands? <HI>Dunce</HI> with an <HI>e,</HI> therefore <HI>Dunceiad</HI> with an <HI>e.</HI> That accurate and punctual Man of Letters, the Re&s;torer of <HI>Shake&s;peare,</HI> con&s;tantly ob|&s;erves the pre&s;ervation of this very Letter <HI>e,</HI> in &s;pelling the
<PB N="66" REF="69">
Name of his beloved Author, and not like his common carele&s;s Editors, with the omi&s;&s;ion of one, nay &s;ometimes of two <HI>ee's,</HI> (as <HI>Shak&s;pear)</HI> which is utterly unpardonable. <Q>&startq;&endq;Nor is the neglect of a <HI>Single Letter</HI> &s;o trivial as to &s;ome it may appear; the alteration whereof in a learned language is an Atchieve|ment that brings honour to the Critic who advances it; and Dr. Bentley will be remembered to po&s;terity for his perform|ances of this &s;ort, as long as the world &s;hall have any e&s;teem for the remains of Menander and Philemon.</Q> <BIBL>THEOBALD.</BIBL></P>
<P>This is &s;urely a &s;lip in the learned author of the foregoing note; there having been &s;ince produced by an accurate Anti|quary, an <HI>Autograph</HI> of <HI>Shak&s;peare</HI> him&s;elf, whereby it appears that he &s;pelled his own name without the fir&s;t <HI>e.</HI> And upon this authority it was, that tho&s;e mo&s;t Critical Curators of his Monument in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abby era&s;ed the former wrong read|ing, and re&s;tored the true &s;pelling on a new piece of old Aegyp|tian Granite. Nor for this only do they de&s;erve our thanks, but for exhibiting on the &s;ame Monument the fir&s;t Specimen of an <HI>Edition</HI> of an author in <HI>Marble;</HI> where (as may be &s;een on comparing the Tomb with the Book) in the &s;pace of five lines, two Words and a whole Ver&s;e are changed, and it is to be hoped will there &s;tand, and outla&s;t whatever hath been hither|to done in Paper; as for the future, our Learned Si&s;ter Univer|&s;ity (the other Eye of England) is taking care to perpetuate a <HI>Total new Shake&s;pear,</HI> at the Clarendon pre&s;s. <BIBL>BENTL.</BIBL></P>
<P>It is to be noted, that this great Critic al&s;o has omitted one circum&s;tance; which is, that the In&s;cription with the Name of Shak&s;peare was intended to be placed on the Marble Scroll to which he points with his hand; in&s;tead of which it is now placed behind his back, and that Specimen of an Edition is put on the Scroll, which indeed Shak&s;peare hath great rea&s;on to point at. <BIBL>ANON.</BIBL></P>
<P>Though I have as ju&s;t a value for the letter <HI>E,</HI> as any Gram|marian living, and the &s;ame affection for the Name of this Poem as any Critic for that of his Author; yet cannot it induce me
<PB N="67" REF="70">
to agree with tho&s;e who would add yet another <HI>e</HI> to it, and call it the <HI>Dunceiade;</HI> which being a French and foreign termi|nation, is no way proper to a word entirely Engli&s;h, and ver|nacular. One <HI>e</HI> therefore in this ca&s;e is right, and two <HI>e's</HI> wrong. Yet upon the whole I &s;hall follow the Manu&s;cript, and print it without any <HI>e</HI> at all; moved thereto by Authority (at all times, with Critics, equal, if not &s;uperior to Rea&s;on.) In which me|thod of proceeding, I can never enough prai&s;e my good friend, the exact Mr. Tho. Hearne; who, if any word occur, which to him and all mankind is evidently wrong, yet keeps he it in the Text with due reverence, and only remarks in the Margin <HI>&s;ic MS.</HI> In like manner we &s;hall not amend this error in the Title it&s;elf, but only note it <HI>obiter,</HI> to evince to the learned that it was not our fault, nor any effect of our ignorance or inat|tention. <BIBL>SCRIBLERUS.</BIBL></P>
<P>This Poem was written in the year 1726. In the next year an imperfect Edition was publi&s;hed at Dublin, and reprinted at London in twelves; another at Dublin, and another at London in octavo; and three others in twelves the &s;ame year. But there was no perfect Edition before that of London in quarto; which was attended with Notes. We are willing to acquaint Po&s;terity, that this Poem was pre&s;ented to King George the Second and his Queen by the hands of Sir Robert Walpole, on the 12^t^h of March, 1728-9. <BIBL>SCHOL. VET.</BIBL></P>
<P>It was expre&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed in the Preface to the fir&s;t edition, that this poem was not publi&s;hed by the Author him&s;elf. It was printed originally in a foreign Country. And what fo|reign Country? Why, one notorious for blunders; where
<PB N="68" REF="73">
finding blanks only in&s;tead of proper names, the&s;e blunderers filled them up at their plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The very <HI>Hero</HI> of the Poem hath been mi&s;taken to this hour; &s;o that we are obliged to open our Notes with a di&s;covery who he really was. We learn from the former Editor; that this Piece was pre&s;ented by the Hands of Sir Robert Walpole to King George II. Now the author directly tells us, his Hero is the Man
<Q><L>&mdash;who brings</L>
<L>The Smithfield Mu&s;es to the ear of Kings.</L></Q>
And it is notorious who was the per&s;on on whom this Prince conferred the honour of the <HI>Laurel.</HI></P>
<P>It appears as plainly from the <HI>Apo&s;trophe</HI> to the <HI>Great</HI> in the third ver&s;e, that Tibbald could not be the per&s;on, who was never an Author in fa&s;hion, or care&s;&s;ed by the Great; whereas this &s;ingle characteri&s;tic is &s;ufficient to point out the true Hero; who, above all other Poets of his time, was the <HI>Peculiar De|light</HI> and <HI>Cho&s;en Companion</HI> of the Nobility of England; and wrote, as he him&s;elf tells us, certain of his Works at the <HI>earn|e&s;t De&s;ire of Per&s;ons of Quality.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, The &s;ixth ver&s;e affords full proof; this Poet being the only one who was univer&s;ally known to have had a <HI>Son</HI> &s;o ex|actly like him, in his poetical, theatrical, political, and moral Capacities, that it could ju&s;tly be &s;aid of him
<Q><L>Still Dunce the &s;econd reign'd like Dunce the fir&s;t. <BIBL>BENTL.</BIBL></L></Q></P>
<P>VER. 1. <HI>The Mighty Mother, and her Son,</HI> &amp;c.] The Reader ought here to be cautioned, that the <HI>Mother,</HI> and not the <HI>Son,</HI> is the principal Agent of this Poem: The latter of them is on|ly cho&s;en as her Collegue (as was anciently the cu&s;tom in Rome before &s;ome great Expedition) the main action of the Poem be|ing by no means the Coronation of the Laureate, which is per|formed in the very fir&s;t book, but the Re&s;toration of the Em|pire of Dulne&s;s in Britain, which is not accompli&s;hed till the la&s;t. <BIBL>W.</BIBL></P>
<P>Ibid.&mdash;<HI>her Son who brings,</HI> &amp;c.] Wonderful is the &s;tupidity of all the former Critics and Commentators on this work! It breaks
<PB N="69" REF="74">
forth at the very fir&s;t line. The author of the Critique prefixed to <HI>Sawney,</HI> a Poem, p. 5. hath been &s;o dull as to explain <HI>the Man who brings,</HI> &amp;c. not of the hero of the piece, but of our Poet him&s;elf, as if he vaunted that <HI>Kings</HI> were to be his readers; an honour, which though this Poem hath had, yet knoweth he how to receive it with more mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>We remit this Ignorant to the fir&s;t lines of the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> a&s;&s;ur|ing him that <HI>Virgil</HI> there &s;peaketh not of him&s;elf, but of <HI>Ae|neas:</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>Arma virumque cano, Trojae qui primus ab oris</L>
<L>Italiam, fato profugus, Lavinaque venit</L>
<L>Littora: multum ille et terris jactatus et alto, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<P>I cite the whole three ver&s;es, that I may by the way offer a <HI>Conjectural Emendation,</HI> purely my own, upon each: Fir&s;t, <HI>ori$</HI> &s;hould be read <HI>aris,</HI> it being, as we &s;ee <HI>Aen.</HI> ii. 513. from the <HI>altar</HI> of <HI>Jupiter Hercaeus</HI> that <HI>Aeneas</HI> fled as &s;oon as he &s;aw <HI>Priam</HI> &s;lain. In the &s;econd line I would read <HI>flatu</HI> for <HI>fato,</HI> &s;ince it is mo&s;t clear it was by <HI>Winds</HI> that he arrived at the <HI>&s;hore</HI> of Italy. <HI>Jactatus,</HI> in the third, is &s;urely as improperly appli|ed to <HI>terris,</HI> as proper to <HI>alto;</HI> to &s;ay a man is <HI>to&s;t on land,</HI> is much at one with &s;aying <HI>he walks at &s;ea: Ri&s;um teneatis, amici?</HI> Correct it, as I doubt not it ought to be, <HI>vexatus.</HI> <BIBL>SCRIBLERUS.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 2. <HI>The Smithfield Mu&s;es] Smithfield</HI> is the place where Bartholomew Fair was kept, who&s;e &s;hews, machines, and dra|matical entertainments, formerly agreeable only to the ta&s;te of the Rabble, were, by the Hero of this poem and others of equal genius, brought to the Theatres of Covent-garden, Lincolns-inn-fields, and the Hay-market, to be the reigning plea&s;ures of the Court and Town. This happened in the Reigns of King George I, and II. See Book iii.</P>
<P>VER. 4. <HI>By Dulne&s;s, Jove, and Fate:]</HI> i. e. By their <HI>Judg|ments,</HI> their <HI>Intere&s;ts,</HI> and their <HI>Inclinations.</HI> <BIBL>W.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 7. <HI>Say how the Godde&s;s</HI> &amp;c.] The Poet ventureth to &s;ing the <HI>Action</HI> of the Godde&s;s: but the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> &s;he impre&s;&s;eth on her illu&s;trious Votaries, he thinketh can be only told by them|&s;elves. <BIBL>SCRIBL. W.</BIBL></P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="75">
VER. 12. <HI>Daughter of Chaos</HI> &amp;c.] The beauty of this whole Allegory being purely of the poetical kind, we think it not our proper bu&s;ine&s;s, as a Scholia&s;t, to meddle with it: But leave it (as we &s;hall in general all &s;uch) to the reader; remarking only that <HI>Chaos</HI> (according to <HI>He&s;iod</HI>'s <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">) was the Progenitor of all the Gods. <BIBL>SCRIBLERUS.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 15. <HI>Laborious, heavy, bu&s;y, bold,</HI> &amp;c.] I wonder the learned Scriblerus has omitted to adverti&s;e the Reader, at the opening of this Poem, that Dulne&s;s here is not be taken con|tractedly for mere Stupidity, but in the enlarged &s;en&s;e of the word, for all Slowne&s;s of Apprehen&s;ion, &s;hortne&s;s of Sight, or imperfect Sen&s;e of things. It includes (as we &s;ee by the Poet's own words) Labour, Indu&s;try, and &s;ome degree of Activity and Boldne&s;s: a ruling principle not inert, but turning top&s;y&punc; turvy the Under&s;tanding, and inducing an Anarchy or confu&s;ed State of Mind. This remark ought to be carried along with the reader throughout the work; and without this caution he will be apt to mi&s;take the Importance of many of the Characters, as well as of the De&s;ign of the Poet. Hence it is, that &s;ome have complained he chu&s;es too mean a &s;ubject, and imagined he em|ploys him&s;elf, like Domitian, in killing flies; whereas tho&s;e who have the true key will find he &s;ports with nobler quarry, and embraces a larger compa&s;s; or (as one &s;aith, on a like oc|ca&s;ion)
<Q><L>Will &s;ee his Work, like Jacob's ladder, ri&s;e,</L>
<L>Its foot in dirt, its head amid the &s;kies. <BIBL>BENTL.</BIBL></L></Q></P>
<P>VER. 16. <HI>She rul'd, in native Anarchy, the mind.] The na|tive Anarchy of the mind</HI> is that &s;tate which procedes the time of Rea&s;on's a&s;&s;uming the rule of the Pa&s;&s;ions. But in that &s;tate,
<PB N="71" REF="76" MS="Y">
the uncontrolled violence of the Pa&s;&s;ions would &s;oon bring things to confu&s;ion, were it not for the intervention of DULNESS in this ab&s;ence of Rea&s;on; who, though &s;he cannot regulate them like Rea&s;on, yet blunts and deadens their Vigour, and, indeed, produces &s;ome of the good effects of it: Hence it is that <HI>Dulne&s;s</HI> has often the appearance of Rea&s;on. This is the only good &s;he ever did; and the Poet takes particular care to tell it in the very intro|duction of his Poem. It is to be ob&s;erved indeed, that this is &s;poken of the univer&s;al rule of Dulne&s;s in ancient days, but we may form an idea of it from her partial Government in later times. <BIBL>W.</BIBL></P>

<P>VER. 33. <HI>One Cell there is,]</HI> The cell of poor Poetry is here very properly repre&s;ented as a little <HI>unendowed Hall</HI> in the neigh|bourhood of the Magnific <HI>College</HI> of Bedlam; and as the &s;ure&s;t Seminary to &s;upply tho&s;e learned walls with Profe&s;&s;ors. For there cannot be a plainer indication of madne&s;s than in mens per&s;i&s;ting to &s;tarve them&s;elves and offend the public by &s;crib|ling,
<Q><L>E&s;cape in Mon&s;ters, and amaze the town.</L></Q>
when they might have benefited them&s;elves and others in pro|fitable and hone&s;t employments. The <HI>Qualities</HI> and <HI>Produc|tions</HI> of the &s;tudents of this private Academy are afterwards de|&s;cribed in this fir&s;t book; as are al&s;o their <HI>Actions</HI> throughout the &s;econd; by which it appears, how near allied Dulne&s;s is to Madne&s;s. This naturally prepares us for the &s;ubject of the third book, where we find them in union, and acting in conjunction to produce the Cata&s;trophe of the fourth; a mad poetical Sibyl leading our Hero through the Regions of Vi&s;ion, to animate him in the pre&s;ent undertaking, by a view of the pa&s;t triumphs of Barbari&s;m over Science. <BIBL>W.</BIBL></P>
<P>VER. 34. <HI>Poverty and Poetry]</HI> I cannot here omit a remark that will greatly endear our Author to every one, who &s;hall at|tentively ob&s;erve that Humanity and Candor, which every where appears in him towards tho&s;e unhappy objects of the ridicule of all mankind, the bad Poets. He here imputes all &s;candalous rhymes, &s;currilous weekly papers, ba&s;e flatteries, wretched ele|gies,
<PB N="75" REF="80">
&s;ongs, and ver&s;es (even from tho&s;e &s;ung at Court to bal|lads in the &s;treets) not &s;o much to malice or &s;ervility as to Dul|ne&s;s; and not &s;o much to Dulne&s;s as to Nece&s;&s;ity. And thus, at the very commencement of his Satire, makes an apology for all that are to be &s;atirized.</P>

<P>Neither Palaephatus, Phurnutus, nor Heraclides give us any &s;teddy light into the mythology of this my&s;terious fable.

<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>TWO things there are, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of which the very ba&s;is of all verbal critici&s;m is founded and &s;upported: The fir&s;t, that an Author could never fail to u&s;e the <HI>be&s;t word</HI> on every occa&s;ion; the &s;econd, that a Critic cannot chu&s;e but know <HI>which that is.</HI> This being granted, whenever any word doth not fully content us, we take upon us to conclude, fir&s;t, that the author could <HI>never have u&s;ed it;</HI> and, &s;econdly, that he mu&s;t have u&s;ed <HI>that very one,</HI> which we conjecture in its &s;tead.</P>
<P>We cannot, therefore, enough admire the learned Scriblerus for his alteration of the text in the two la&s;t ver&s;es of the pre|ceding book, which in all the former editions &s;tood thus:
<Q><L>Hoar&s;e thunder to its bottom &s;hook the bog,</L>
<L>And the loud nation croak'd, God &s;ave king Log.</L></Q>
He has, with great judgment, tran&s;po&s;ed the&s;e two epithets; put|ting <HI>hoar&s;e</HI> to the nation, and <HI>loud</HI> to the thunder: And this being evidently the true reading, he vouch&s;afed not &s;o much as to mention the former; for which a&s;&s;ertion of the ju&s;t right of a Critic, he merits the acknowledgment of all &s;ound Commenta|tors.</P>
<P>VER. 2. <HI>Henley's gilt tub,]</HI> The pulpit of a Di&s;&s;enter is u&s;ually called a Tub; but that of Mr. Orator Henley was co|vered with velvet, and adorned with gold.

As a plain repetition of great actions is the be&s;t prai&s;e of them, we &s;hall only &s;ay of this eminent man, that he carried the Trade ma|ny lengths beyond what it ever before had arrived at; and that he was the envy and admiration of all his profe&s;&s;ion. He po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="129" REF="139">
him&s;elf of a command over all authors whatever; he cau&s;ed them to write what he plea&s;ed; they could not call their very <HI>Names</HI> their own. He was not only famous among the&s;e; he was taken notice of by the <HI>State,</HI> the <HI>Church,</HI> and the <HI>Law,</HI> and received particular marks of di&s;tinction from each.</P>
<P>It will be owned that he is here introduced with all po&s;&s;ible dignity: He &s;peaks like the intrepid Diomed; he runs like the &s;wift-footed Achilles; if he falls, 'tis like the beloved Ni&s;us; and (what Homer makes to be the chief of all prai&s;es) he is <HI>fa|voured of the Gods;</HI> he &s;ays but three words, and his prayer is heard; a Godde&s;s conveys it to the &s;eat of Jupiter: Though he lo&s;es the prize, he gains the victory; the great Mother her|&s;elf comforts him, &s;he in&s;pires him with expedients, &s;he honours him with an immortal pre&s;ent (&s;uch as Achilles receives from Thetis, and Aeneas from Venus) at once in&s;tructive and pro|phetical: After this he is unrivalled and triumphant.</P>
<P>The tribute our author here pays him is a grateful return for &s;everal unmerited obligations: Many weighty animadver&s;ions on the public affairs, and many excellent and diverting pieces on private per&s;ons, has he given to his name. If ever he owed two ver&s;es to any other, he owed Mr. Curl &s;ome thou&s;ands. He was every day extending his fame, and enlarging his Writings: Witne&s;s innumerable in&s;tances; but it &s;hall &s;uffice only to men|tion the <HI>Court Poems,</HI> which he meant to publi&s;h as the work of the true writer, a Lady of quality; but being fir&s;t threatened, and afterwards puni&s;hed for it by Mr. Pope, he generou&s;ly tran&s;|ferred it from <HI>her</HI> to <HI>him,</HI> and ever &s;ince printed it in his name. The &s;ingle time that ever he &s;poke to C. was on that affair, and to that happy incident he owed all the favours &s;ince received from him: So true is the &s;aying of Dr. Sydenham, <Q>&startq;that any one &s;hall be, at &s;ome time or other, the better or the wor&s;e, for having but <HI>&s;een</HI> or <HI>&s;poken</HI> to a good or bad man.&endq;</Q></P>

<P>VER. 5, 6, &amp;c. Hereby is intimated that the following Vi|&s;ion is no more than the chimera of the dreamer's brain, and not a real or intended &s;atire on the pre&s;ent Age, doubtle&s;s more learned, more enlightened, and more abounding with great Genius's in Divinity, Politics, and whatever arts and &s;ciences, than all the preceding. For fear of any &s;uch mi&s;take of our Poet's hone&s;t meaning, he hath again, at the end of the Vi&s;ion, repeated this monition, &s;aying that it all pa&s;s'd through the <HI>Ivory gate,</HI> which (according to the Ancients) denoteth Fal&s;ity. <BIBL>SCRIBL.</BIBL></P>

VER. 15. <HI>A &s;lip-&s;hod Sibyl]</HI> This allegory is extremely ju&s;t, no conformation of the mind &s;o much &s;ubjecting it to real <HI>Mad|ne&s;s,</HI> as that which produces real <HI>Dulne&s;s.</HI> Hence we find the religious (as well as the poetical) Enthu&s;ia&s;ts of all ages were ever, in their natural &s;tate, mo&s;t heavy and lumpi&s;h; but on the lea&s;t application of <HI>heat,</HI> they run like lead, which of all metals falls quicke&s;t into fu&s;ion. Whereas <HI>fire</HI> in a Genius is truly Promethean, it hurts not its con&s;tituent parts, but only fits it (as it does well-tempered &s;teel) for the nece&s;&s;ary impre&s;|&s;ions of art. But the common people have been taught (I do not know on what foundation) to regard Lunacy as a mark of <HI>Wit,</HI> ju&s;t as the Turks and our modern Methodi&s;ts do of <HI>Ho|line&s;s.</HI> But if the cau&s;e of Madne&s;s a&s;&s;igned by a great Philo|&s;opher be true, it will unavoidably fall upon the dunces. He &s;uppo&s;es it to be the <HI>dwelling over long on one object or idea:</HI> Now as this attention is occa&s;ioned either by Grief or Study, it will be fixed by Dulne&s;s; which hath not quickne&s;s enough to comprehend what it &s;eeks, nor force and vigour enough to divert the imagination from the object it laments. <BIBL>W.</BIBL></P>

VER. 24. <HI>Old Bavius &s;its,]</HI> Bavius was an ancient Poet, celebrated by Virgil for the like cau&s;e as Bays by our author, though not in &s;o chri&s;tian-like a manner: For heatheni&s;hly it is declared by Virgil of Bavius, that he ought to be <HI>hated</HI> and <HI>dete&s;ted</HI> for his evil works; <HI>Qui Bavium non</HI> odit; whereas we have often had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve our Poet's great <HI>Good Nature</HI> and <HI>Mercifulne&s;s</HI> thro' the whole cour&s;e of this Poem. <BIBL>SCRIBL.</BIBL></P>
<P>Mr. Dennis warmly contends, that Bavius was no incon&s;i|derable author; nay, that <Q>&startq;He and Maevius had (even in Augu&s;tus's days) a very formidable party at Rome, who thought them much &s;uperior to Virgil and Horace: For (&s;aith he) I cannot believe they would have fixed that eternal brand upon them, if they had not been coxcombs in more than ordinary credit.&endq;</Q> Rem. on Pr.

VER. 34. <HI>Ward in Pillory.]</HI> John Ward of Hackney, E&s;q. Member of Parliament, being convicted of forgery, was fir&s;t expelled the Hou&s;e, and then &s;entenced to the Pillory on the 17th of February 1727. Mr. Curl (having likewi&s;e &s;tood there) looks upon the mention of &s;uch a Gentleman in a &s;atire, as a <HI>great act of barbarity,</HI> Key to the Dunc. 3d edit. p. 16. And another author rea&s;ons thus upon it. Durgen. 8vo. p. 11, 12. <Q>&startq;How unworthy is it of <HI>Chri&s;tian Charity</HI> to animate the <HI>rab|ble</HI> to abu&s;e a <HI>worthy man</HI> in &s;uch a &s;ituation? What could move the Poet thus to mention a <HI>brave &s;ufferer,</HI> a <HI>gallant pri&s;oner,</HI> expo&s;ed to the view of all mankind! It was laying a&s;ide his <HI>Sen&s;es,</HI> it was committing a <HI>Crime,</HI> for which the <HI>Law</HI> is <HI>deficient</HI> not to puni&s;h him! nay, a Crime which <HI>Man can &s;carce forgive,</HI> or <HI>Time efface!</HI> Nothing &s;urely could have induced him to it but being bribed by a great Lady, &amp;c.&endq;</Q> (to whom this brave, hone&s;t, worthy Gentleman was guilty of no offence but Forgery, proved in open Court.) But it is evident, this ver&s;e could not be meant of him; it being notorious, that no <HI>Eggs</HI> were thrown at that Gentleman. Per|haps therefore it might be intended of Mr. Edward Ward the Poet when he &s;tood there.</P>
<P>VER. 36. <HI>And length of ears,]</HI> This is a <HI>&s;ophi&s;ticated</HI> reading. I think I may venture to affirm all the Copyi&s;ts are mi&s;taken
<PB N="183" REF="196">
here: I believe I may &s;ay the &s;ame of the Critics; Dennis, Oldmixon, Wel&s;ted have pa&s;&s;ed it in &s;ilence. I have al&s;o &s;tum|bled at it, and wondered how an error &s;o manife&s;t could e&s;cape &s;uch accurate per&s;ons. I dare a&s;&s;ert it proceeded originally from the inadvertency of &s;ome Tran&s;criber, who&s;e head ran on the <HI>Pillory,</HI> mentioned two lines before; it is therefore amazing that Mr. Curl him&s;elf &s;hould over look it! Yet that <HI>Scholia&s;t</HI> takes not the lea&s;t notice hereof. That the learned Mi&s;t al&s;o read it thus, is plain from his ranging this pa&s;&s;age among tho&s;e in which our author was blamed for <HI>per&s;onal Satire</HI> on a <HI>Man's face</HI> (whereof doubtle&s;s he might take the <HI>ear</HI> to be a part;) &s;o likewi&s;e Concannen, Ralph, the Flying Po&s;t, and all the herd of Commentators.&mdash;<HI>Tota armenta &s;equuntur.</HI></P>

<P>VER. 37. <HI>Settle]</HI> Elkannah Settle was once a Writer in vogue, as well as Cibber, both for Dramatic Poetry and Politics. Mr. Dennis tells us that <Q>&startq;he was a formidable rival to Mr. Dryden, and that in the Univer&s;ity of Cambridge there were tho&s;e who gave him the <HI>preference.&endq;</HI></Q> Mr. Wel&s;ted goes yet farther in his behalf: <Q>&startq;Poor Settle was formerly the <HI>Mighty rival</HI> of Dry|den; nay, for <HI>many years,</HI> bore his reputation <HI>above</HI> him,&endq;</Q> Pref. to his Poems, 8vo. p. 31. And Mr. Milborn cried out, <Q>&startq;How little was Dryden able, even when his blood run high, to defend him&s;elf again&s;t Mr. Settle!&endq;</Q> Notes on Dryd. Vir. p. 175. The&s;e are comfortable opinions! and no wonder &s;ome authors indulge them.</P>
<P>He was author or publi&s;her of many noted pamphlets in the time of king Charles II. He an&s;wered all Dryden's political

poems; and being cried up on <HI>one &s;ide,</HI> &s;ucceeded not a little in his Tragedy of the Empre&s;s of Morocco (the fir&s;t that was ever printed with Cuts.) <Q>&startq;Upon this he grew in&s;olent, the Wits writ again&s;t his Play, he replied, and the Town judged he had the better. In &s;hort, Settle was then thought a very formidable rival to Mr. Dryden; and not only the Town but the Univer&s;ity of Cambridge was divided which to pre|fer; and in both places the younger &s;ort inclined to Elka|nah.&endq;</Q> DENNIS Pref. to Rem. on Hom.</P>

It made its progre&s;s into Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, where it was performed twenty four days together: It was la&s;t acted in Minorca. The fame of it was not confined to the author only; the ladies carried about with them the favourite &s;ongs of it in fans; and hou&s;es were furni&s;hed with it in &s;creens.

<P>I judge quite otherwi&s;e of this pa&s;&s;age: The genuine reading is <HI>Libertas,</HI> and <HI>Rege:</HI> So Claudian gave it.

<P>It is &s;tyled <HI>Heroic,</HI> as being <HI>doubly</HI> &s;o; not only with re&s;pect to its nature, which, according to the be&s;t rules of the ancients, and &s;tricte&s;t ideas of the moderns, is critically &s;uch; but al&s;o with regard to the heroical di&s;po&s;ition and high courage of the writer, who dar'd to &s;tir up &s;uch a formidable, irritable, and implacable race of mortals.</P>
<P>There may ari&s;e &s;ome ob&s;curity in chronology from the <HI>Names</HI> in the poem, by the inevitable removal of &s;ome authors, and in&s;ertion of others, in their niches.

<P>I would not have the reader too much troubled or anxious, if he cannot decypher them; &s;ince when he &s;hall have found them out, he will probably know no more of the per&s;ons than before.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ADVERTISEMENT</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the FIRST EDITION with Notes, in Quarto, 1729.</HEAD>
<P>IT will be &s;ufficient to &s;ay of this edition, that the reader has here a much more correct and complete copy of the DUNCIAD, than has hitherto appear'd. I cannot an&s;wer but &s;ome mi&s;takes may have &s;lipt into it, but a va&s;t number of others will be prevented by the names being now not only &s;et at length, but ju&s;tified by the authorities and rea&s;ons given. I make no doubt, the author's own motive to u&s;e real rather than feign'd names, was his care to pre&s;erve the innocent from any fal&s;e application; whereas in the former editions, which had no more than the initial letters, he was made, by keys printed here, to hurt the inoffen&s;ive; and (what was wor&s;e) to abu&s;e his friends, by an impre&s;&s;ion at Dublin.</P>
<P>The commentary which attends this poem was &s;ent me from &s;everal hands, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be unequally written; yet will have one advantage over mo&s;t commentaries, that it is not made upon conjectures, or at a remote di&s;tance of time: And the reader cannot but derive one plea&s;ure from the very <HI>Ob|&s;curity</HI> of the per&s;ons it treats of, that it partakes of the nature of a <HI>Secret,</HI> which mo&s;t people love to be let into, tho' the men or the things be ever &s;o incon&s;iderable or trivial.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> it was judg'd proper to give &s;ome account: For &s;ince it is only in this monument that they mu&s;t expect to &s;urvive (and here &s;urvive they will, as long as the Engli&s;h tongue &s;shall remain &s;uch as it was in the reigns of Queen ANNE and king GEORGE,) it &s;eem'd but humanity to be&s;tow a word or two upon each, ju&s;t to tell what he was, what he writ, when he liv'd, and when he died.</P>
<P>If a word or two more are added upon the chief offenders, 'tis only as a paper pinn'd upon the brea&s;t, to mark the enor|mities for which they &s;uffer'd; le&s;t the correction only &s;hould be remember'd, and the crime forgotten.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="329">
In &s;ome articles it was thought &s;ufficient, barely to tran&s;cribe from Jacob, Curl, and other writers of their own rank, who were much better acquainted with them than any of the authors of this comment can pretend to be. Mo&s;t of them had drawn each other's characters on certain occa&s;ions; but the few here in&s;erted are all that could be &s;aved from the general de&s;truction of &s;uch works.</P>
<P>Of the part of Scriblerus I need &s;ay nothing; his manner is well enough known, and approv'd by all but tho&s;e who are too much concern'd to be judges.</P>
<P>The Imitations of the Ancients are added, to gratify tho&s;e who either never read, or may have forgotten them; together with &s;ome of the parodies and allu&s;ions to the mo&s;t excellent of the Moderns. If, from the frequency of the former, any man think the poem too much a Cento, our poet will but appear to have done the &s;ame thing in je&s;t which Boileau did in earne&s;t; and upon which Vida, Fraca&s;torius, and many of the mo&s;t emi|nent Latin poets, profe&s;&s;edly valued them&s;elves.</P>

<P>WE apprehend it can be deemed no injury to the author of the three fir&s;t books of the Dunciad, that we publi&s;h this Fourth. It was found merely by accident, in taking a &s;urvey of the <HI>Library</HI> of a late eminent nobleman; but in &s;o blotted a condition, and in &s;o many detach'd pieces, as plainly &s;hewed it to be not only <HI>incorrect,</HI> but <HI>unfini&s;hed.</HI> That the author of the three fir&s;t books had a de&s;ign to extend and complete his poem in this manner, appears from the di&s;&s;ertation prefix'd to it, where it is &s;aid, that <HI>the de&s;ign is more exten&s;ive, and that we</HI>
<PB N="316" REF="330">
<HI>may expect other epi&s;odes to complete it:</HI> And from the declara|tion in the argument to the third book, that <HI>the accompli&s;hment of the prophecies therein, would be the theme hereafter of a greater Dunciad.</HI> But whether or no he be the author of this, we de|clare our&s;elves ignorant.

<P>I HAVE long had a de&s;ign of giving &s;ome &s;ort of Notes on the works of this poet. Before I had the happine&s;s of his acquaintance, I had written a commentary on his <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Man,</HI> and have &s;ince fini&s;hed another on the <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m.</HI> There was one already on the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> which had met with general approbation: but I &s;till thought &s;ome additions were wanting (of a more &s;erious kind) to the humorous notes of <HI>Scriblerus,</HI> and even to tho&s;e written by Mr. <HI>Cleland,</HI> Dr. <HI>Ar|buthnot,</HI> and others. I had lately the plea&s;ure to pa&s;s &s;ome months with the author in the country, where I prevailed up|on him to do what I had long de&s;ired, and favour me with his explanation of &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in his works. It happened, that
<PB N="317" REF="331">
ju&s;t at that juncture was publi&s;hed a ridiculous book again&s;t him, full of Per&s;onal Reflections, which furni&s;hed him with a lucky opportunity of improving <HI>This Poem,</HI> by giving it the only thing it wanted, a <HI>more con&s;iderable Heor.</HI> He was always &s;en|&s;ible of its defect in that particular, and owned he had let it pa&s;s with the Hero it had, purely for want of a better; not entertaining the lea&s;t expectation that &s;uch an one was re&s;erved for this Po&s;t, as has &s;ince obtained the <HI>Laurel:</HI> But &s;ince that had happened, he could no longer deny this ju&s;tice either to <HI>him</HI> or the <HI>Dunciad.</HI></P>
<P>And yet I will venture to &s;ay, there was another motive which had &s;till more weight with our Author: This per&s;on was one, who from every Folly (not to &s;ay Vice) of which another would be a&s;hamed, has con&s;tantly derived a <HI>Vanity;</HI> and therefore was the <HI>man in the world who would lea&s;t be hurt by it.</HI> <BIBL>W.

He looks upon God's go&s;pel as a fooli&s;h fable, like the Pope, to whom he is a pitiful purveyor <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.

It is true, &s;oft and ea&s;y lines might become Ovid's Epi&s;tles or Art of Love&mdash;But Virgil, who is all great and maje&s;tic, &amp;c. re|quires &s;trength of lines, weight of words, and clo&s;ene&s;s of ex|pre&s;&s;ions; not an ambling Mu&s;e running on Carpet-ground, and &s;hod as lightly as a Newmarket-racer.&mdash;He has number|le&s;s faults in his Author's meaning, and in propriety of ex|pre&s;&s;ion <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Pag. 22, and 192.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>He hath a knack at &s;mooth ver&s;e, but without either Genius or good &s;en&s;e, or any tolerable knowledge of Engli&s;h.

<P>The time and date of the Action is evidently in the la&s;t reign, when the office of City Poet expir'd upon the death of <HI>Elkanah Settle,</HI> and he has fix'd it to the Mayoralty of Sir <HI>Geo.

For whoever will con&s;ider the Unity of the whole de&s;ign, will be &s;en&s;ible, that the <HI>Poem was not made for the&s;e Authors, but the&s;e Authors for the Poem:</HI> And I &s;hould judge they were clapp'd in as they ro&s;e, fre&s;h and fre&s;h, and chang'd from day to day, in like manner as when the old boughs wither, we thru&s;t new ones into a chimney.</P>
<P>I would not have the reader too much troubled or anxious, if he cannot decypher them; &s;ince when he &s;hall have found them out, he will probably know no more of the Per&s;ons than before.</P>
<P>Yet we judg'd it better to pre&s;erve them as they are, than to change them for <HI>fictitious names,</HI> by which the Satyr would only be multiplied&punc; and applied to many in&s;tead of one.

<P>I am indeed aware, that this name may to &s;ome appear too <HI>mean,</HI> for the Hero of an Epic Poem: But it is hoped, they will alter that opinion, when they find, that an Author no le&s;s eminent than <HI>la Bruyere</HI> has thought him worthy a place in his Characters.</P>
