<P>Methought I was in the Mid&s;t of a very agreeable
Set of Company, and extremely delighted in attend|ing
to a lively Conver&s;ation; when on a &s;udden I
perceived one of the mo&s;t &s;hocking Figures, Imagi|nation
can frame, advancing towards me. She was
dre&s;&s;ed in black: her Skin was contracted into a
thou&s;and Wrinkles, her Eyes deep &s;unk in her Head,
and her Complexion pale and livid as the Countenance
<PB N="92" REF="101">
of Death. Her Looks were filled with Terror
and unrelenting Severity; and her Hands were
armed with Whips and Scorpions. As &s;oon as &s;he
came near, with a horrid Frown, and a Voice that
chilled my very Blood, &s;he bade me follow her: I
obeyed; and &s;he led me through rugged Paths be&s;et
with Briars and Thorns, into a deep &s;olitary Valley.
Wherever &s;he pa&s;t, the fading Verdure withered be|neath
her Steps: her pe&s;tilential Breath infected the
Air with malignant Vapours, ob&s;cured the Lu&s;tre of
the Sun, and involved the fair Face of Heaven in
an univer&s;al Gloom. Di&s;mal Howlings re&s;ounded
through the Fore&s;t: from every baleful Tree the
Night Raven uttered his dreadful Note; and the
whole Pro&s;pect was filled with De&s;olation and Hor|ror.
In the mid&s;t of this tremendous Scene, my
execrable Guide addre&s;&s;ed me in the following
Manner:</P>
<P>&startq;Retire with me, O ra&s;h unthinking Mortal,
from the vain Allurements of a deceitful World;
and learn that Plea&s;ure was not de&s;igned the
Portion of human Life. Man was born to mourn,
and to be wretched. This is the Condition of
all below the Stars, and whoever endeavours to
oppo&s;e it, acts in Contradiction to the Will of
Heaven. Fly then from the fatal Enchantments
of Youth and &s;ocial Delight: and here con&s;ecrate
thy &s;olitary Hours to Lamentation and Woe.
Mi&s;ery is the Duty of all &s;ublunary Beings; and
every Enjoyment is an Offence to the Deity,
who is to be wor&s;hipped only by the Mortification
<PB N="93" REF="102">
of every Sen&s;e of Plea&s;ure, and by the ever|la&s;ting
Exerci&s;e of Sighs and Tears.&endq;</P>
<P>This melancholy Picture of Life quite &s;unk my
Spirits, and &s;eemed to annihilate every Principle of
Joy within me. I threw my&s;elf beneath a bla&s;ted
Yew, where the Winds blew cold and di&s;mal round
my Head, and dreadful Apprehen&s;ions chilled my
Heart. Here I re&s;olved to lie till the Hand of Death,
which I impatiently invoked, &s;hould put an End to
the Mi&s;eries of a Life &s;o deplorably wretched. In
this &s;ad Situation, I &s;pied on one Hand of me, a deep
muddy River, who&s;e heavy Waves rolled on, in &s;low
&s;ullen Murmurs. Here I determined to plunge; and
was ju&s;t upon the Brink, when I found my&s;elf &s;ud|denly
drawn back: I turned about and was &s;urpri&s;ed
by the Sight of the mo&s;t lovely Object I had ever
beheld. The mo&s;t engaging Charms of Youth and
Beauty appeared in all her Form: effulgent Glories
&s;parkled in her Eyes, and their awful Splendors
were &s;oftened by the gentle&s;t Looks of Compa&s;&s;ion
and Peace. At her Approach the frightful Spectre,
who had before tormented me, vani&s;hed away, and
with her all the Horrors which &s;he had cau&s;ed. The
gloomy Clouds brightened into chearful Sun&s;hine;
the Groves recovered their Verdure, and the whole
Region looked gay and blooming as the Garden of
<HI>Eden.</HI> I was quite tran&s;ported at this unexpected
Change, and reviving Plea&s;ure began to gladden my
Thoughts: when, with a Look of inexpre&s;&s;ible
Sweetne&s;s, my Deliverer thus uttered her divine
In&s;tructions.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="103">
&startq;My Name is <HI>Religion.</HI> I am the Offspring of
<HI>Truth,</HI> and the Parent of <HI>Benevolence, Hope,</HI> and
<HI>Joy.</HI> That Mon&s;ter, from who&s;e Power I have
freed you, is called <HI>Super&s;tition.</HI> She is the Child
of <HI>Di&s;content,</HI> and her Followers are <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Sor|row.</HI>
Thus different as we are, &s;he has often the
In&s;olence to a&s;&s;ume my Name and Character, and
&s;educes unhappy Mortals to think us the &s;ame,
till &s;he, at length, drives them to the Borders of
De&s;pair; that dreadful Aby&s;s, into which you
were ju&s;t going to &s;ink.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Look round, and &s;urvey the various Beauties
of this Globe, which Heaven has de&s;tined for the
Seat of Human Race, and con&s;ider, whether a
World thus exqui&s;itely framed, could be meant
for the Abode of Mi&s;ery and Pain! For what End
has the lavi&s;h Hand of Providence diffu&s;ed &s;uch in|numerable
Objects of Delight, but that all might
rejoice in the Privilege of Exi&s;tence, and be filled
with Gratitude to the beneficent Author of it?
Thus to enjoy the Ble&s;&s;ings he has &s;ent, is Virtue
and Obedience; and to reject them, merely as the
Means of Plea&s;ure, is pitiable Ignorance, or ab&s;urd
Perver&s;ene&s;s. Infinite Goodne&s;s is the Source of
created Exi&s;tence. The proper Tendency of every
rational Being, from the highe&s;t Order of raptured
Seraphs to the meane&s;t Rank of Men, is to ri&s;e
ince&s;&s;antly from lower Degrees of Happine&s;s to
higher; and each have Faculties a&s;&s;igned them for
various Orders of Delight.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What,&endq; cried I, &startq;is this the Language of
<HI>Religion?</HI> Does &s;he lead her Votaries through
<PB N="95" REF="104">
flowery Paths, and bid them pa&s;s an unlaborious Life
of gay Amu&s;ement? Where are the painful Toils
of Virtue? The Mortifications of Penitents, and
the &s;elf-denying Exerci&s;es of Saints and Heroes?
Are the&s;e only the gloomy Conceits of vi&s;ionary
Devotees? Are there no Difficulties to be en|countered?
No Re&s;traints to be endured? Does
the Whole of Human Duty con&s;i&s;t in the chearful
Enjoyment of a beautiful World, and a con&s;tant
Indulgence of the &s;oft Tran&s;ports of Plea&s;ure?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not &s;uch a Kind of Plea&s;ure,&endq; an&s;wered &s;he,
&startq;as ari&s;es from the thoughtle&s;s Gaiety of a u&s;ele&s;s
Life. The Enjoyments of a rea&s;onable Being
cannot con&s;i&s;t in unbounded Indulgence, or luxu|rious
Ea&s;e; in the Tumult of licentious Pa&s;&s;ion,
the Languor of indolent Repo&s;e, or the Flutter
of light Amu&s;ements. Yielding to immoral Plea|&s;ures
corrupts the Mind; living to animal and
trifling ones, deba&s;es it; both, in their Degree,
di&s;qualify it for it's genuine Good, and con&s;ign
it over to Wretchedne&s;s. Whoever would be
really happy, mu&s;t make the diligent and regular
Exerci&s;e of his &s;uperior Powers his chief Atten|tion,
adoring the Perfections of his Maker, ex|pre&s;&s;ing
Good-will to his Fellow creatures, and
cultivating inward Rectitude. To his lower Fa|culties
he mu&s;t allow &s;uch Gratifications as will,
by refre&s;hing him, invigorate his nobler Pur&s;uits.
In the Regions inhabited by Angelic Natures, un|mingled
Felicity for ever blooms: Joy flows there
with a perpetual and unbounded Stream; nor
needs there any Mound to check it's Cour&s;e.&endq;
<PB N="96" REF="105">
&startq;Beings con&s;cious of a Frame of Mind originally
di&s;ea&s;ed, as all the Human Race has Rea&s;on to
be, mu&s;t u&s;e the Regimen of a &s;tricter Self-Go|vernment.
Whoever has been guilty of volun|tary
Exce&s;&s;es, mu&s;t patiently &s;ubmit both to
the painful Workings of Nature, and needful Se|verities
of Medicine, in order to his Cure. Still
he is intitled to a moderate Share of whatever al|leviating
Accommodations this fair Man&s;ion of his
merciful Parent affords, con&s;i&s;tent with his Re|covery;
and, in Proportion as this Recovery ad|vances,
the livelie&s;t Joy will &s;pring from his &s;ecret
Sen&s;e of an amended and improving Heart.&mdash;So
far from the Horrors of De&s;pair is the Condition
even of the Guilty.&mdash;Shudder, poor Mortal, at
the Thought of that Gulph into which thou wa&s;t
going to plunge.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;While the more Faulty have every Encourage|ment
to amend, the more innocent Soul will be
&s;upported with &s;till &s;weeter Con&s;olations, under
all it's Experience of Human Infirmities: Sup|ported
by the gladdening A&s;&s;urances, that every
&s;incere Endeavour to out-grow them &s;hall be a&s;|&s;i&s;ted,
accepted, and rewarded. To &s;uch a one,
the lowlie&s;t Self-Aba&s;ement is but a deep-laid
Foundation for the mo&s;t elevated Hopes: &s;ince
they, who faithfully examine, and acknowledge
what they are, &s;hall be enabled, under my Con|duct,
to become what they de&s;ire. The Chri&s;|tian
and the Hero are in&s;eparable; and to the
A&s;pirings of una&s;&s;uming Tru&s;t, and filial Con&s;i|dence,
are &s;et no Bounds. To him, who is ani|mated
<PB N="97" REF="106">
with a View of obtaining Approbation from
the Sovereign of the Univer&s;e, no Difficulty is
un&s;urmountable. Secure in this Pur&s;uit of every
needful Aid, his Conflict with the &s;evere&s;t Pains
and Trials, is little more than the vigorous Exer|ci&s;e
of a Mind in Health. His patient Depen|dence
on that Providence, which looks through
all Eternity, his &s;ilent Re&s;ignation, his ready Ac|commodation
of his Thoughts and Behaviour to
it's in&s;crutable Ways, is at once the mo&s;t excel|lent
&s;ort of Self-denial, and a Source of the mo&s;t
exalted Tran&s;ports. Society is the true Sphere of
human Virtue. In &s;ocial active Life, Difficulties
will perpetually occur; Re&s;traints of many Kinds
will be ncce&s;&s;ary: and &s;tudying to behave right in
Re&s;pect of the&s;e, is a Di&s;cipline of the human
Heart u&s;eful to others, and improving to it&s;elf.
Suffering is no Duty, but where it is nece&s;&s;ary to
avoid Guilt, or to do Good; nor is Plea&s;ure a
Crime, but where it &s;trengthens the Influence of
bad Inclinations, or le&s;&s;ens the generous Activity
of Virtue. The Happine&s;s allotted to Man in his
pre&s;ent State, is indeed faint and low, compared
with his immortal Pro&s;pects and noble Capacities:
but yet, whatever Portion of it the di&s;tributing
Hand of Heaven offers to each Individual, is a
needful Support and Refre&s;hment for the pre&s;ent
Moment, &s;o far as it may not hinder the Attain|ment
of his final De&s;tination.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Return then, with me, from continual Mi&s;ery,
to moderate Enjoyment, and grateful Alacrity.
Return from the contracted Views of Solitude, to
<PB N="98" REF="107">
the proper Duties of a relative and dependent Be|ing.
Religion is not confined to Cells and Clo|&s;ets,
nor re&s;trained to &s;ullen Retirement: the&s;e
are the gloomy Doctrines of Super&s;tition, by which
&s;he endeavours to break tho&s;e Chains of Benevo|lence
and &s;ocial Affection, that link the Wel|fare
of every Particular with that of the Whole.
Remember, that the greate&s;t Honour you can pay
to the Author of your Being, is by &s;uch a chear|ful
Behaviour, as di&s;covers a Mind &s;atisfied with
his Di&s;pen&s;ations.&endq;</P>
<P>Here my Preceptre&s;s pau&s;ed: and I was going to
expre&s;s my Acknowledgments for her Di&s;cour&s;e,

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS very many well-di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons, by the
unavoidable Nece&s;&s;ity of their Affairs, are
&s;o unfortunate as to be totally buried in the
Country, where they labour under the mo&s;t deplor|able
Ignorance of what is tran&s;acting among the po|lite
Part of Mankind, I cannot help thinking but
that, as a public Writer, you &s;hould take the Ca&s;e
of the&s;e truly-compa&s;&s;ionable Objects under your
Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The&s;e unhappy Langui&s;hers in Ob&s;curity, &s;hould
be furni&s;hed with &s;uch Accounts of the Employments
of People of the World, as may engage them, in
their &s;everal remote Corners, to a laudable Imita|tion:
or, at lea&s;t, &s;o far inform and prepare them,
that if, by any joyful Change of Situation, they
&s;hould be &s;uddenly tran&s;ported into the gay Scenes,
<PB N="100" REF="109">
they may not gape, and wonder, and &s;tare, and be
utterly at a Lo&s;s how to behave, and make a proper
Appearance in it.</P>
<P>It is inconceivable how much the Welfare of all the
Country Towns in the Kingdom might be promoted,
if you would u&s;e your charitable Endeavours to rai&s;e
in them a noble Emulation of the Manners and Cu&s;|toms
of higher Life.</P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e, you &s;hould give a very clear and
ample De&s;cription of the whole Set of polite Acquire|ments;
a complete Hi&s;tory of Forms, Fa&s;hions, Fro|lics,
of Routs, Drums, Hurricanes, Balls, A&s;&s;em|blies,
Ridottos, Ma&s;querades, Auctions, Plays, O|peras,
Puppet-&s;hows and Bear-gardens: of all tho&s;e
Delights which profitably engage the Attention of
the mo&s;t &s;ublime Characters, and by which they have
brought to &s;uch amazing Perfection the whole Art
and My&s;tery of pa&s;&s;ing Day after Day, Week after
Week, and Year after Year, without the heavy A&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of any one thing, that formal Animals are
plea&s;ed to call u&s;eful or nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>In giving due In&s;tructions through what Steps to
attain this Summit of human Excellence, you may
add &s;uch irre&s;i&s;tible Arguments in it's Favour, as
mu&s;t convince Numbers, who in other In&s;tances do
not &s;eem to want natural Under&s;tanding, of the un|accountable
Error of &s;uppo&s;ing they were &s;ent into the
World for any other Purpo&s;e but to flutter, &s;port,
and &s;hine: for, after all, nothing can be clearer,
than that an everla&s;ting Round of Diver&s;ion, and
the more &s;prightly and hurrying the better, is the
mo&s;t important End of human Life.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="110">
It is really prodigious, &s;o much as the World is
improved, that there &s;hould, in the&s;e Days, be Per|&s;ons
&s;o ignorant and &s;tupid, as to think it nece&s;&s;ary
to mi&s;-&s;pend their Time, or trouble their Heads
about any thing el&s;e than pur&s;uing the pre&s;ent Fan|cy:
for what el&s;e is worth living for?</P>
<P>It is Time enough &s;urely to think of Con&s;equen|ces
when they come: and as for the antiquated No|tions
of Duty, they are not to be met with in any
<HI>French</HI> Novel, or any Book one ever looks into, but
derived almo&s;t wholly from the Writings of Authors
who lived a va&s;t many Ages ago, and who, as they
were totally without any Idea of tho&s;e Accompli&s;h|ments
which now characterize People of Di&s;tinction,
have been for &s;ome Time &s;inking apace into utter
Contempt. It does not appear that even their mo&s;t
zealous Admirers, for &s;ome Partizans of his own &s;ort
every Writer will have, can pretend to &s;ay they were
ever at one Ma&s;querade. In the important Article
of Diver&s;ions, the Ceremonial of Vi&s;its, the extatic
Delight of unfriendly Intimacies, and unmeaning
Civilities, they are ab&s;olutely &s;ilent. Blunt Truth
and downright Hone&s;ty, plain Cloaths, &s;taying at
Home, hard Work, few Words, and tho&s;e unen|livened
with Cen&s;ure or double Meaning, are what
they recommend as the Ornaments and Plea&s;ures of
Life. Little Oaths, polite Di&s;&s;imulation, Tea-table
Scandal, delightful Indolence, the Glitter of Finery,
the Triumph of Precedence, the Enchantments of
Flattery, are things of which they &s;eem to have had
no Notion: and one cannot help laughing, to think
what a Figure they would have made in a Vi&s;iting|room,
<PB N="102" REF="111">
and how frighted they would have looked at
a Gaming-table. The noble Zeal of Patrioti&s;m,
that di&s;dains Authority, and tramples on Law for
Sport, was their ab&s;olute Aver&s;ion: and, indeed,
one cannot di&s;cover any one thing that they pretend
to teach People, but to be wi&s;e and good; Accom|pli&s;hments
infinitely below the Con&s;ideration of Per|&s;ons
of Ta&s;te and Spirit, who know how to &s;pend
their Time to &s;o much better Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Among other admirable Improvements, pray,
Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> do not forget to enlarge on the very
exten&s;ive Benefits of playing at Cards on <HI>Sundays;</HI> a
Practice of &s;uch infinite U&s;e, that we may mode&s;tly
expect to &s;ee it univer&s;ally prevail in all Parts of this
Kingdom. To Per&s;ons of Fa&s;hion, the Advantage
is obvious: becau&s;e, as for &s;ome &s;trange Rea&s;on or
other, which no fine Gentlemen or Lady has yet
been able to penetrate, there is neither Play not
Ma&s;querade, nor bottled Conjurer, nor any other
thing worth living for, to be had on a <HI>Sunday,</HI> if it
were not for the charitable A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Whi&s;t or
Bragg, the genteel Part of Mankind mu&s;t, one Day
in &s;even, nece&s;&s;arily &s;uffer a total Extinction of
Being.</P>
<P>Nor are Per&s;ons of high Rank the only Gainers
by &s;o &s;alutary a Cu&s;tom, which extends it's good
Influence, in &s;ome Degree, to the lower Orders of
People: but, were it quite general, how much bet|ter
and happier would the World be, than it is even
now.</P>
<P>It is hard upon poor Creatures, be they ever &s;o
mean, to deny them tho&s;e Enjoyments and Liberties
<PB N="103" REF="112">
which are equally open for all: yet if Servants were
taught to go to Church on this Day, to &s;pend &s;ome
Part of it in reading, or receiving In&s;truction in a
Family Way, and the re&s;t in mere friendly Conver|&s;ation,
the poor Wretches would infallibly take it
into their Heads, that they were obliged to be &s;ober,
mode&s;t, diligent, and faithful to their Ma&s;ters and
Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. Now &s;urely none of common Prudence
and Humanity would wi&s;h their Dome&s;tics infected
with &s;uch &s;trange primitive Notions, or laid under
&s;uch unmerciful Re&s;traints: all which may, in a
great Mea&s;ure, be prevented, by the Prevalence of
the good-humoured Fa&s;hion, which I would have
you recommend. For when the lower Kind of
People &s;ee their Betters, with a truly laudable Spirit,
in&s;ulting and flying in the Face of tho&s;e rude ill-bred
Dictators, Piety, and the Laws, they are thereby
excited and admoni&s;hed, as far as Actions can admo|ni&s;h
and excite, and taught, that they too have an
equal Right of &s;etting them at Defiance, in &s;uch In|&s;tances
as their particular Nece&s;&s;ities and Inclinations
may require: and thus is the Liberty of the whole
human Species mightily improved and enlarged.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Mr. <HI>Rambler,</HI> by a faithful Repre&s;enta|tion
