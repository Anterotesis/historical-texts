<HEAD>TALE I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Prince&s;s Gracio&s;a, and Prince
Percinet.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Empire of the <HI>Fairies,</HI>
had not flouri&s;h'd many
Centuries, but there reign|ed
in the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Coun|tries,
a King and Queen,
with &s;o m$ch Clemency
and Ju&s;tice, that they had
gain'd the Hearts of all
their Subjects. They had indeed no male I&s;&s;ue,
to leave the Crown to, but were ble&s;s'd with
a Daughter, perfectly made Beautiful by Na|ture
and Art. This accompli&s;h'd Prince&s;s, for
the &s;weetne&s;s of her Di&s;po&s;ition, was called
<HI>Gracio&s;a.</HI> As &s;he grew up, &s;he became the
<PB N="2" REF="11">
Queen her Mother's Darling, and con&s;equent|ly
wanted nothing an indulgent Parent could
give her; in&s;omuch, that her Garb was in$&s;ti|mable,
her Diet mo&s;t delicate, and her At|tendants
becoming one of the greate&s;t Prin|ce&s;&s;es
in the World.</P>
<P>Among the re&s;t of the Ladies that made up
her Father's Court, was the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Gr$g|non;</HI>
extream Rich, but mon&s;trous Ugly, Red-Hair'd,
blear-Ey'd, hump-Back'd, bandy-Leg'd,
and every way Deform'd both in Soul and
Body. She bore an inveterate Malice to <HI>Graci|o&s;a,</HI>
and knowing the Lu&s;tre of her Merits
would become more tran&s;parent, by her ugly
appearance at Court, thro' Envy retir'd into
the Country.</P>
<P>In proce&s;s of Time, when Fortune had run a
Series of Mirth and Tranquility, it happen'd
that the Queen &s;icken'd and dy'd; who&s;e Death
afflicting <HI>Gracio&s;a,</HI> and her Father &s;o violently,
there was Rea&s;on to fear it would &s;horten
their Days. The King had kept retir'd a
whole-Year, 'till at la&s;t, per&s;uaded by his Phy|&s;icians,
he went a Hunting for the Benefit of
his Health. Upon the Borders of his Forre&s;t he
came within &s;ight of a &s;tately Ca&s;tle, and the
Weather being extream Hot, it oblig'd him to
leave the Cha&s;e, and ride there to refre&s;h him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Grognon</HI> (who&s;e Ca&s;tle it
was) went to wait upon his M$je&s;ty, and con|duct
him in. They were no &s;ooner en$red,
but the cunning Dutche&s;s familliarly told his
Maje&s;ty, that the coole&s;t retirement in her
Ca&s;tle, was a &s;pacious arch'd Vaul$, which &s;he
<PB N="3" REF="12">
de&s;i$'d him to vi&s;it. The King agreed, where,
to his &s;urprize, he beheld, as he thought, above
a Hundred P$p$s of Wine, plac'd very orderly.
Are th$&s;e for your own U&s;e, Madam? (&s;aid
he.) For none but my Self and Family, (<HI>re|ply'd
&s;he</HI>) Will your M$j$&s;ty be pleas'd to take
a Gla&s;s of what Wine you like be&s;t, among all
the&s;e? Troth, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> if I ta&s;te any, it
&s;hall be <HI>Champagne.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately&punc; <HI>Grognon</HI> &s;truck with a little
Si$ver Hammer the $word$ of a Pipe, and a&s;&s;oon
came out a Million of Guineas. How comes
this? <HI>&s;aid &s;he, Laughing,</HI> Then &s;he &s;truck ano|ther
Pipe, and out fl$w &s;everal Bu&s;hels of <HI>Lewis
d'Ors.</HI> Hey day! <HI>cry'd &s;he, in a &s;urprize,</HI> What
means all this? Then &s;he knock'd her little
Hammer again&s;t the Head of a Third Pipe, and
there were as many Pearls, Diamonds, and
precious Stones flung out, as would cover the
Floor. The cunning Dutche&s;s to amu&s;e the
King, cry'd out in a Pa&s;&s;ion, That &s;he was
cheated of her Wines, by &s;ome Villains, who
had in the room thereof, only left her tho&s;e
fooli&s;h Baubles; and &s;eem'd to lament bitterly.
What&punc; d'ye call the&s;e Baubles? <HI>&s;aid the King.</HI>
Why, Woman, they are of more Value than
Ten of the riche&s;t Cities in the World.
Well Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I own it; and mu&s;t confe&s;s,
there is not one Pipe here, but what is full of
Gold, and precious I wels, and they are all at
your Maje&s;ty's di&s;po&s;al, provided you'll con&s;ent
to Marry me, and make me as much Queen and
Mi&s;tre&s;s of your Daughter as her Mother was.
The covetous King, neglectful of his Daugh|ter's
<PB N="4" REF="13">
Welfare, cry'd a Match! and gave her his
Hand upon't; where at &s;he pre&s;ented him with
the Key of her Wealth, and for that time parted.</P>
<P>The King no &s;ooner return'd to Court, but
<HI>Gracio&s;a</HI> receiv'd him with Joy, and embracing
him, cry'd, What Sport, my dear Father?
Sport, Child, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> why I have taken alive
Pigeon. Commit it then to my Care, <HI>reply'd
&s;he,</HI> and I will make much of it. No, no, <HI>&s;aid
the King</HI> to tell you the Truth, 'tis the Dutche&s;s
of <HI>Grognon</HI> whom I have met with, and taken
to Wife. Here <HI>Gracio&s;a</HI> cry'd out to Heaven,
and in a Rage &s;aid, the Counte&s;s was ten thou|&s;and
times more like an Owl than a Pigeon.
Peace, <HI>&s;aid the King,</HI> it's my Plea&s;ure it &s;hould
be &s;o, therefore prepare to receive her with the
&s;ame Duty you paid to the late Queen your
Mother.</P>
<P>The Obedient, but di&s;con&s;olate Prince&s;s re|tir'd
to her Chamber, in order to obey his
Commands; but, alas! her Tears and Com|plaints
&s;oon brought her N$r&s;e thither al&s;o, who
lov'd her intirely. The Prince&s;s having $old
her what her Father had done, Weep-not, my
pretty Mi&s;tre&s;s, <HI>cry'd the Nur&s;e.</HI> 'Twill be better
for you to be Dutiful to your Father; in which
you will give a noble Example becoming your
Princely Nature; promi&s;e me, therefore, to
comply with your Father's Plea&s;ure, and Time
&s;hall make you amends.</P>
<P><HI>Gracio&s;a</HI> promis'd &s;he would; and went and
dre&s;s'd her&s;elf all in Green, &s;haded with Gold,
her Hair hanging in Curls loo&s;e on her Shoul|ders;
on her Head was a Cor$net of J$&s;&s;amine
<PB N="5" REF="14">
and Ro&s;es; &s;o that <HI>Venus</HI> never appear'd more
beautiful.</P>
<P>All this time <HI>Grognon</HI> was &s;triving to wa&s;h
the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> White, by adorning her&s;elf with
all the &s;umptuous O$naments &s;he could procure$
and to hide her Deformity, had made u&s;e of
a rais'd $word$, Gla&s;s Eye, Bol&s;ters, for her Back
and Brea&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Her hagged Cheeks, and thin
Jaws, &s;he plai&s;ter'd White, and vainly indea|vour'd
to hide the Redne&s;s of her Hair with a
Black-lead Comb,</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the King was making ready, <HI>Gracio&s;a</HI>
reti$'d to a &s;hady Grove, to ea&s;e her Brea&s;t with
more freedom, but whil&s;t &s;he was bemoaning
her&s;elf, &s;he &s;aw a Page coming to her, cloathed
in Green S$lk, with White Feathers in his Cap.
A&s;&s;o$n as be approach'd her, he laid one Knee to
the Ground, and with a profound Reverence,
&s;aid, Madam, the King your Father waits your
pre&s;ence. <HI>Gracio&s;a,</HI> not knowing the Page,
wonder'd at his Beauty, and &s;uppos'd him to
be one of <HI>Grognon</HI>'s Retinue. But he undeceiv'd
her, and &s;aid, Tho he kept him&s;elf unknown,
yet he was her Slave, and would never belong
to any body el&s;e: Therefore let not your High|ne&s;s
be troubled, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> for my Name is,
<HI>Percinet,</HI> a Prince of Wealth and Parts &s;uffici|ently
known, who to prevent the Misfortunes
you may fall under by your Father's Marriage,
and make you Happy hereafter, am now and
then by virtue of the Gift of <HI>Faryi&s;m,</HI> render'd
invi&s;ible to your Highne&s;s, and every body
el&s;e. However, I have always your Company,
my Heart is intirely yours; and I will for ever
<PB N="6" REF="15">
wait upon you for your Welfare. The Prince&s;s
recovering her&s;elf from a Surprize, cry'd out,
And is it you, lovely <HI>Percinet,</HI> whom I have &s;o
long de&s;ir'd to &s;ee? You tran&s;port me in offer|ing
your Friend&s;hip; take me into your Care,
and let <HI>Grognon</HI> do her wor&s;t. She had no &s;oon|er
&s;aid this, but <HI>Percinet,</HI> who had provided a
&s;umptuous Hor&s;e for his beautiful Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;eat|ed
her on the Saddle, whil&s;t &s;he &s;uffer'd him
to lead her to her Father, and have the Felicity
of &s;eeing his Mi&s;tre&s;s all the while.</P>
<P>Thus the King, Prince&s;s, and all the Nobility
met <HI>Grognon</HI> upon the Road; but, ala$! the
Bea&s;t &s;he rode upon appear'd more like a Car$-Hor&s;e,
than a Nag for a Queen: So that the
Eyes of all were only upon the beautiful Prin|ce&s;s,
and her pretty Page in Green; which made
the ill-natur'd <HI>Grognon</HI> look as &s;$wre as if &s;he
had eaten a Cart-load of Crabs.</P>
<P>The King took no Notice of this Re&s;entment
his Head running more on Wealth than any
thing el&s;e: But when <HI>Grognon</HI> came nearer,
and &s;aw <HI>Gracio&s;a</HI> thus glittering, and &s;o &s;tately
mounted, &s;nuffing up her No&s;e; She broke Si|lence,
and &s;aid: What, &s;hall that Pu&s;s have a
better Steed than I? Let me rather return to
my Ca&s;tle, than be thus &s;erv'd.</P>
<P>The King then order'd <HI>Gracia&s;a</HI> to di&s;mount,
and offer <HI>Grognon</HI> her Hor&s;e, which was done
accordingly: But <HI>Grognon,</HI> when mounted on
the Palfrey, was ne'er the more minded. Then,
for&s;ooth, the Green Page mu&s;t lead her Hor&s;e;
and &s;o the Picture of ill Looks, rode like a
Pedler's Bundle, till &s;he came to Court: But,
<PB N="7" REF="16">
alas! &s;he was no &s;ooner there, but the noble
Steed broke loo&s;e, and ran away, dragging her
with one Foot in the Stir$up, thro' Dirt and
Mire, till &s;he lookt like a Cinder Wench; but
&s;he was overtaken at la&s;t, and taken up in &s;uch
a bloody, dirty pickle, with her head bruis'd,
and a broken Arm, that never was any Carted
Bawd in &s;uch a Condition.</P>
<P>Thus they pick'd up the King's broken pie|ces
of Earthen Ware, and carried her to his
Palace, where &s;he was put to Bed, and the
Surgeon &s;ent for. But notwith&s;tanding her
Brui&s;es, &s;he &s;torm'd and rayl'd-like a <HI>Billin&s;gate;</HI>
and &s;wore 'twas one of <HI>Graci$&s;a</HI>'s Tricks to
pick out &s;uch an unruly Jade only to murder
her; and &s;ent word, That if the King did not
do her Ju&s;tice, &s;he would retire home.</P>
<P>The avaricious King, for &s;ear of lo&s;ing the
We$lth, went and &s;$ung him&s;elf at her wretch|ed
Feet, and told her &s;he &s;hould be at her di&s;|po&s;al
to be puni&s;h$d as &s;he pleas'd; and accor|dingly
order'd the trembling Prince&s;s to be de|liver'd
immediately to her.</P>
<P><HI>Gracio&s;a</HI> no &s;ooner entred <HI>Grognon</HI>'s Apart|ment,
but f$ur Hags &s;iez'd and &s;tript her to
$he Alaba&s;ter Skin. Flea$her! flea her! (cry'd
$ruel <HI>Grognon</HI>) till none of that white Skin &s;he
$s &s;o proud of is left. Now, thought <HI>Gracio&s;a,</HI>
$word$ could wi&s;h with all my So$l, my pretty Page
was here, were it not to &s;ee my Nakedne&s;s ex|$pos'd.
So &s;he &s;ubmitted to their mercile&s;s
$courging with Rods as they thought, till they
were weary: But the Prince&s;s had her Wi&s;h;
<PB N="8" REF="17">
for <HI>Percinet</HI> had ca&s;t a Mi$t before their Eyes,
and made them u&s;e only Feathers for Rod$; &s;o
that when they were &s;ufficiently tired, they
&s;$ung on her Garments and left her.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s retir'd to her Chamber, and
feigning an Indi&s;po&s;ition, took to her Bed, at
which time <HI>Percinet</HI> appear'd in a Corner of the
Room, and out of Re&s;pect kept him&s;elf at a di|&s;tance.
The Prince&s;s &s;oon &s;aw him, and gave
him Thanks for a Kindne&s;s which, &s;he &s;aid,
&s;hould ever render him dear to her. She con|jur'd
him to be always ready to protect her, till
&s;he was in a Condition to give him what he &s;o
much wi&s;h'd and de&s;erv'd: But withal, de&s;ir'd
him out of D$cency to retire at that time. He
gladly reply'd, he would punctually obey her
Orders, and increa&s;e the Re&s;pect he had for &s;o
&s;weet a Mi&s;tre&s;s; and then withdrew.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Grognon</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he had reveng'd her
&s;elf &s;ufficiently, mended rather &s;ooner than
could be expected; &s;o that in a little time &s;he
was marry'd to the King in great Pomp. At
the &s;ame time her Picture was drawn, and ex|pos'd,
a Tournament proclaim'd, and Six bold
Knights were to maintain her the greate&s;t Beau|ty
in the Univer&s;e. At every Fight the ugly
Queen was pre&s;ent, and thought the Eyes of all
the Beholders, were upon her, when, alas! they
were fix'd on the immatchle&s;s <HI>Gracio&s;a,</HI> who
&s;tood behind her.</P>
<P>When the Tournament was thought to be
over, all of a &s;udden, a young Knight appear'd,
with a Box enamel'd with Diamonds in his
Hand, and with a loud Voice declar'd <HI>Grognon</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="18">
to be the uglie&s;t piece of Nature in the World;
and running again&s;t the Six Knights, unhors'd
them, and remain'd Victor. Then <HI>Percinet</HI> ex|pos'd
the Picture of <HI>Gracio&s;a</HI> in his Diamond
Box, at which Sight, every one knew it to be
hers; and having made obey&s;ance to <HI>Gracio&s;a,</HI>
he rode away, without giving any Account of
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Had you &s;een how <HI>Grognon</HI> look'd at this
Affront, you would have thought &s;he would
have bur&s;t with Envy. The Pride of her Heart
was &s;o great, that &s;tamping her Feet in a rage,
&s;he turn'd to <HI>Grae$i$&s;a,</HI> and &s;aid, Di&s;pute with
me the Prize of Beauty! Hah! if I die, I'll be
reveng'd. Ah, Madam, <HI>cry'd the Prince&s;s,</HI> I
am innocent, and own you to be the mo&s;t ex|cellent
Beauty. No, $word$, Mi&s;s <HI>Highty-Tighty,
&s;aid</HI> Grognon, <HI>interrupting her,</HI> it &s;hall be my
Turn next, and I'll be even with you.</P>
<P>The King was told what Danger the Prince&s;s
was in, but was deaf to any Redre&s;s; and &s;o
the cruel Queen, when Night came, forc'd
<HI>Gracio&s;a</HI> into a Coach, which, in a few Days,
left her in a Forre&s;t Three Hundred Miles di|&s;tant,
full of Bea&s;ts of Prey, as Tygers, Bears,
Wolves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Heart of this tender Prince&s;s was ready
to break in her Solitude: She wept, &s;he &s;igh'd,
and &s;pent her time in fruitle&s;s wand'rings a|mong&s;t
exqui&s;ite Briars and Thorns, which pe|netrating
her tender Skin, made the Blood
trickle from her delicate Limbs.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, overcome with Grief, &s;he fell down,

Sigh, when immediately all the Tre$s in the
Forre&s;t, had lighted Tapers hanging on their
Branches; and ca&s;ting her Eyes upwards, &s;he
&s;aw a mo&s;t lovely Palace, built with Chry|&s;tal,
which &s;hone as the Sun. Ah! <HI>thought
&s;he,</HI> this is Prince <HI>Percinet</HI>'s doing; but was
fearful of the Event; and thought it better
to die, than to yield to Love in that Place.</P>
<P>Turning her Back to the Ca&s;tle, &s;he was for
running away; but alas! 'twas in vain; <HI>Per|cinet</HI>
overtook her more beautiful than ever:
He cry'd, Ah, my dear Prince&s;s, why do you
fly your Adorer? Have my good Offices made
you di&s;tru&s;t the Duty I &s;hall owe? Comfort
your&s;elf, and let not Fear harbour in that ten|der
Brea&s;t, which is the Clo&s;et of my Soul:
You &s;hall be happy with me in <HI>Fairy-Land,</HI>
where the Queen my Mother, and my Si&s;ters,
will make them&s;elves merry to &s;ee you, whom
they love as well as my &s;el$.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Gracio&s;a</HI> had nothing to &s;ay, her Sen&s;es
were charm'd, and Gratitude made Silence own
her Con&s;ent to &s;et by him in a little Chariot
drawn by two &s;wift-footed <HI>Harts,</HI> who ran
like the Wind. As they pa&s;t along, the Prince
&s;how'd her a Thou&s;and Delicacies; as Shepherds
and lovely Sheperde&s;&s;es, &s;porting on the Downs;
young Swa$ns courting their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; and a
World of Amours, and other pretty Fancies,
extreamly plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>The &s;wift Cour&s;ers, by this time, had reach'd
the Palace of <HI>Fairy-Land;</HI> and here 'twas that
the Soul of <HI>Gracio&s;a</HI> was ravi&s;h'd with the mo&s;t
melodious Mu&s;ick. The Queen and her Daugh|ters,
<PB N="11" REF="20">
embrac'd and led her into a &s;tately Room,
&s;urrounded with Chri&s;tal Walls; at which
In&s;tant, to her great &s;urprize, &s;he &s;aw an exact
Hi&s;tory of her Life to that very Minu$e. Re|covering
her&s;elf a little, &s;ays &s;he to <HI>Percinet,</HI>
Your Arti&s;ts, Sir, are very exqui&s;ite here; for
no &s;ooner do I make the lea&s;t Alteration in my
&s;elf, but it's pre&s;ently engrav'd before my Face:
'True, Madam, <HI>reply'd he,</HI> it's becau&s;e none of
your Perfections which po&s;&s;e&s;s my Soul, &s;hould
be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s &s;mil'd, and turning to her Ma|je&s;ty,
had no &s;ooner thank'd her for &s;uch a ge|nerous
Reception, but the Tables were &s;pread,
and nothing that could be thought Rich, or
Delicate, was wanting. The Prince&s;s fed with
a good Stomach, and repleni&s;h'd her&s;elf chear|fully;
but the more with the Thoughts of find|ing
<HI>Percinet</HI> in a Place where &s;he might expect
to lo&s;e her Life by Savage Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>When Dinner was ended, <HI>Percinet</HI> conducted
her to an <HI>Opera,</HI> wherein was repre&s;ented the
Amours of <HI>P&s;yche</HI> and <HI>Cupid,</HI> with a great deal
of Life and Spirit, which pleas'd the Prince&s;s
<HI>Gra$i$&s;a</HI> extreamly&punc;</P>
<P>The time to Re&s;t drawing on, the Queen &s;ent
her Daughters to conduct her to Bed, attended
by Twenty-four beautiful Virgins, who were
to be her Guard 'till the next Morning. The
Prince&s;s endeavour'd to repo&s;e her&s;elf, but in
vain: She knew all was <HI>Inchantment,</HI> and there|fore
&s;he told <HI>Percinet,</HI> That tho' &s;he could not
but admire the difference of Treatment &s;he met
with, from that of her Step-Mother <HI>Grognon,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="21">
yet Duty to the King her Father, over-ballanc'd
at that time, any other Pa&s;&s;ion; and conjur'd
him, as he expected a &s;olid Reward of his Love,
to conduct her in Safety home again; though
&s;uch a &s;eparation from the Queen his Mother:
and the Prince&s;&s;es his Si&s;ters, might &s;en&s;ibly
afflict her.</P>
<P>The Prince gave her the hearing, and lookt
upon what &s;he &s;aid to be only a Female Effort
to try the con&s;tancy of his Affection. He fan|cied
a Night's Sleep would make her forget &s;o
unplea&s;ant a Theme; and therefore with a
Thou&s;and Adieus, left her to her Repo&s;e.</P>
<P>The Morning aro&s;e with the Sun, and the
lovely Prince&s;s as bright as them both, when
<HI>Percinet</HI> &s;tood before her, in Cloth of Gold
trim'd with Green: He knew what Dre&s;s
would plea&s;e her, and therefore cho&s;e Green,
which was her Delight. Never did Heaven and
Earth render a Man more com$lear; and Na|ture,
'till now, &s;eem'd imperfect.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as <HI>Gracio&s;a</HI> &s;aw him, &s;he &s;etcht a Sigh
and &s;aid, Ah, <HI>Percinet,</HI> the remembrance of my
Misfortunes bani&s;h my Re&s;t, and I dread the
Effects! Madam, <HI>reply'd</HI> Percinet <HI>pa&s;&s;ionately,</HI>
You have no rea&s;on to fear in a glace where
you reign Sovereign! Would you quit your
Admirers, for the Cruelty of a Step-Mother?
Would you relinqui&s;h the Tenderne&s;s of your
Slave <HI>Percinet,</HI> for the Severities of One who is
in&s;atiably Cruel? Ah, Madam, forget not,
forget not your&s;elf&mdash;I cannot help it, <HI>re|ply'd
the Prince&s;s,</HI> 'tis the Duty I owe to a Fa|ther,
and I &s;hould be more happy, if you would
<PB N="13" REF="22">
join with me in the &s;ame Sentiments. But, Oh-And
here &s;he &s;igh'd.&mdash;</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Percinet</HI> embracing her, put a &s;top to
her Sighs; and as a Te&s;timony of his Confor|mity
to her Will, promis'd, That after Eight
Days Diver&s;ion, he would conduct her to her
Father's Palace.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s rejoyc'd to hear the&s;e Words?
and whil&s;t they were di&s;cour&s;ing together, had
a &s;ecret De&s;ire to know what was tran&s;act|ed
by <HI>Grognon</HI> during her Ab&s;ence; and ha|ving
notified her Mind to <HI>Percinet,</HI> he took
her to a high Tower, built on a Chry&s;tal Rock,
on which he $word$ her &s;et her Foot, and hold her
little Finger on his Hips. She did, and im|mediately
&s;he &s;aw <HI>Grognon,</HI> and her Father &s;it|ting
together. She heard her per&s;uading her
Father, That <HI>Gracio&s;a,</HI> thro'. Pride, had hang'd
her&s;elf in the Cellar; and that there remain'd
nothing but to bury her: She &s;aw him Weep
for the lo&s;s of his Daughter: She &s;aw the &s;ub|tle
Step-Mother dre&s;s in a S$roud, a Wooden
Log, and put in a Coffin, to deceive the
King: She &s;aw all this, attended with a &s;o|lemn
Proce&s;&s;ion, and with pompous Ceremony
laid in the Grave; every one condoling her
Death, and cur&s;ing the Wretch that was the
Cau&s;e of it; whil&s;t her Father ab&s;tain'd from
Food, and griev'd exce&s;&s;ively.</P>
<P>The Grief of the King was that alone which
pierc'd the Heart of <HI>Gracio&s;a;</HI> and therefore
&s;he earne&s;tly implor'd <HI>Percinet</HI> to tran&s;port her
Home, to undeceive her Father.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="23">
The Prince endeavour'd to per&s;uade her to
the contrary; by finding his Endeavours to
no purpo&s;e, Well, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I mu&s;t obey you;
but perhaps you may &s;ee Cau&s;e more than
once to wi&s;h your &s;el$ here again, tho' not up|on
the Account of <HI>Percinet,</HI> whom you thus
puni&s;h with the &s;everity of a hard Heart.</P>
<P>Having taken leave of the Queen, and the
Prince&s;&s;es, and rode together in a Chariot till
they came ju&s;t without the Palace, the whole
Building fell in&s;tantly into Ten Thou&s;and
Heaps, and was totally buried. The N$i&s;e &s;ur|priz'd
the Prince&s;s, but the Sight more; &s;o that
&s;he de&s;ir'd to know the meaning of &s;o &s;udden
a D$&s;&s;olution. Madam, <HI>&s;ays</HI> Percinet, <HI>&s;ome|thing
Chagrin,</HI> it is &s;o, my Court mu&s;t be in the
Grave; nor will you ever re-enter, till the
King of Terrors has robb'd you of another
Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this they came immediately to
the King's Palace. When the Prince became
invi&s;ible; but the Prince&s;s &s;oon flew to her Fa|ther's
Camber, and lay pro&s;trate before him. At
fir&s;t the King &s;uppos'd 'twas her Gho&s;t, and
&s;tarted thro' fear; but &s;he beld by his Robes,
and &s;oon convinc'd him to the contrary. She
told him, that &s;he had liv'd in a Forre&s;t, and
how cruel <HI>Grognon</HI> had impos'd upon him by a
mock Funeral of a Log; and de&s;ir'd his Pro|tection
to &s;creen her from further Dang$r.</P>
<P>The over-joy'd King care&s;s'd his Daughter;
and &s;ent immediate Orders to dig up her &s;up|po&s;ed
Grave; where (as &s;he had &s;aid) all the
Cheat was di&s;cover'd Yet the King was too
<PB N="15" REF="24">
Effeminate to puni&s;h the Treachery! And when
$t was told <HI>Grognon,</HI> that the Prince&s;s was with
her Father, &s;he ran de&s;perately to his Apart|ment,
&s;wearing that &s;he would immediately
have that pretended Daughter of his, or $word$ &s;he
would with all her Riches, forthwith depart
this Realm; affirming, that <HI>Gracio&s;a</HI> had hang'd
her&s;elf, and that this was an Impo&s;tor.</P>
<P>The coddle$word$ King was &s;o weak as to
&s;ubmit; &s;o that <HI>Grognon&punc;</HI> with a helli&s;h Joy.
had her once more in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. She &s;oon put
her Cruelty in Execution. She caus'd her to
be thrown into a &s;tinking Dungeon; and in|&s;tead
of Princely Robes, cloth'd her with
Canvas, made her wear a Tarpaulin Cap, and
fed her with Bread and Water.</P>
<P>As Afflictions recollect pa&s;t Deliverances, &s;o
this brought to Mind the Words of <HI>Percinet;</HI>
but &s;he dur&s;t not wi&s;h her&s;elf in <HI>Faeiry-Land,</HI>
nor call to him for Relief; &s;uppo&s;ing that the
Love of that Prince was le&s;&s;en'd, for which
&s;he might thank her&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Grognon,</HI> who had invok'd
Hell for Advice, had procur'd a Fairy to a&s;|&s;i&s;t
her, ten times more devili&s;h than her&s;elf.
They laid their diabolick Heads together, and
con&s;ulted how they might puni&s;h her with
Tasks impo&s;&s;ible to be perform'd by any Mor|tal.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing the <HI>Fairy</HI> procu$'d, was a
Skein of Thread three Yards round, &s;o thin,
that the lea&s;t touch would break it; to which
there was neither beginning nor ending.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="25">
<HI>Grognon</HI> no &s;ooner had it, but &s;he carry'd i$
to the Prince&s;s, and &s;aid, <HI>Here, Hu&s;&s;y, unrave$
this, or I'll flea thee alive:</HI> And &s;o left her, &s;e|cur'd
under three Locks.</P>
<P><HI>Gracio&s;a</HI> viewing it, took it up to find a$
beginning, but, alas! her pretty Fingers, th$
fine enough, had broke it in &s;o many places
that in de&s;pair &s;he gave i$$over and wept. And
now &s;he exclaim'd again&s;t her Severity to <HI>Per|cinet,</HI>
and wi&s;h'd &s;he had never been &s;o cruel
She only beg'd the Favour of him to come and
receive from her Lips her la&s;t Breath.&mdash;And
here &s;he fell a weeping.</P>
<P>The tender-hearted P$ince knew all this, and
immediately went and &s;tood before her, with
a little Wand in his Hand. <HI>I am here,</HI> (&s;aid
he) <HI>and cannot be from the Service of my Prin|ce&s;s,
tho' I am &s;lighted never &s;o much.</HI> And
with that &s;truck $he Skein with his Wand
three times, and it immediately unravel'd.
What further, Madam? <HI>&s;ays he.</HI> Will you ne|ver
invoke me, but in your Afflictions, to vex$
a Lover, that cannot take back what he has
given to you? Why then will you not be
happy? You delight, &s;urely, to be mi&s;erable,
becau&s;e you know it afflicts me: If other|wi&s;e,
what are you afraid of?&mdash;<HI>That
your Love is not real,</HI> &s;aid the Prince&s;s: <HI>Let
Time convince me it is.</HI>&mdash;Here the Prince
took his leave; and much concern'd at her Jea|lou&s;y,
retir'd.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the Sun &s;et, but <HI>Grognon</HI> went
to &s;ee if &s;he had perform'd that Miracle; when
to her &s;urprize, <HI>Gracio&s;a</HI> mode&s;tly pre&s;ented her
<PB N="17" REF="26">
the Skein unravel'd to Perfection. She &s;tifled
her Pa&s;&s;ion, with much ado; But told her,
She was an aukward Siut; that &s;he had not
kept it clean, and &s;uch-like &s;piteful &s;tuff; and
withal bid her remember it, with two unmerci|ful
Blows o'er the Face.</P>
<P>The cruel Bea&s;t, thus baulk'd in her fir&s;t
At empt, &s;well'd with Envy, and call'd her <HI>Fa|miliar</HI>
once more. She de&s;ir'd &s;omething of
the <HI>Fairy</HI> to be impos'd on the Prince&s;s, that
might be beyond Imagination to perform.</P>
<P>'Tis agreed; and a large Tub was order'd to
be fill'd with the Feathers of all &s;orts of Birds

Birds them&s;elves &s;hould not tell their own:
And the <HI>Fairy</HI> her&s;elf $&s;&s;ur'd Queen <HI>Grognon,</HI>
that it would infallibly confound the Wit and
Patience of her Slave.</P>
<P>Oh, how glad was <HI>Grognon</HI> at this News!
Revenge put Wings to her pace, 'till &s;he came
to the Prince&s;s. The Tub of Feathers being
ready, <HI>Here, Impudence,</HI> (&s;aid &s;he) <HI>&s;ort the&s;e,

before.</P>
<P>The innocent Virgin began her Endeavours,
but finding them fruitle&s;s, and the Work im|po&s;&s;ible,
gave it over with a Heart full of Grief.
I &s;ee now, <HI>&s;aid &s;he, (with a Tone that could break
a Hear$ of Flint</HI>) my Death is the Life of my
Enemy; and I mu&s;t &s;ubmit. O that I &s;hould

But, Madam (<HI>&s;aid</HI> Percinet) does nothing $word$

&s;trongly into her Mind to open the Box, not|with&s;tanding

<P>Well, open'd it is, when, (O wounderful!)

At la&s;t the Prince&s;s thought it high time to

By her Command, a very deep Hole was dug

<P>Who would imagine now, but here was an

At the&s;e Words, <HI>Gracio&s;a</HI> &s;ell down before

<HEAD>TALE II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Leander, or the Blew-Bird Prince, and
the Prince&s;s Florina.</HEAD>
<P>IN former Days liv'd a Sovereign Prince,
who&s;e Strength and Riches were &s;o great,
that he was formidable to all his Neigh|bours.
But what increas'd his Comfort, was
the enjoyment of one of the mo&s;t virtuo$s and
beautiful Prince&s;&s;es in the World. But this
Happine&s;s la&s;ted not long; for in a little time
the Queen died, after a violent Sickne&s;s of
fifteen Days:</P>
<P>There was a univer&s;al Sorrow to be &s;een for
&s;o great a Lo&s;s; and the King having devoted
him&s;elf &s;o much to Grief, that like one deliri|ous,
he tore his Hair, rent his Mantle, and fa&s;t|ed
eight Days.</P>
<P>The whole Court, fearing he might de&s;troy
him&s;elf, us'd all their Endeavours to comfort
him, but their good Offices were in vain, and
whatever they had done prov'd un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, a cunning, di&s;&s;embling, &s;elf-ended
Widow of Quality, undertook to bani&s;h from
His Maje&s;ty, a Melancholly that had brought
<PB N="26" REF="35">
him to the Borders of Death. She Veil'd her|&s;elf;
and went and humour'd his Grief; and
whil&s;t he commended the Endowments of his
decea&s;ed Queen, &s;he blubber'd out <HI>Elegies,</HI> en|larging
as much upon the Qualities of her
dead Husband. And thus the &s;ubtle Widow
lamented &s;o grievou&s;ly, that it mov'd the King
to pity her, and by Degrees to forget his own
Grief.</P>
<P>Having gone thus far, &s;he threw a&s;ide her
Veil, and with fal&s;e Fire in his Eyes, put a &s;top
to his Tears, and manag'd her part &s;o dexterou&s;|ly,
that the late Queen's Memory was forgot,
and nothing would &s;erve his turn, but he
mu&s;t take her to Wi&s;e.</P>
<P>Well, to make &s;hort on't, married they were,
to the great A&s;toni&s;hment of all that heard
it.</P>
<P>At the time of this Second Marriage, both
of them had two only Daughters; the King
one nam'd <HI>Florina,</HI> the Glory of the World;
and the new Queen another nam'd <HI>Truitone;</HI>
de&s;picable, lik her Mother; of a &s;warthy, grea|&s;y
Complexion, with a Freckle Skin, like the
Back of a Trout; and of a Temper ba&s;e as
Vice could picture.</P>
<P>The Daughter mu&s;t needs be a Jewel in the
Eyes of the Original; and therefore the Queen
cal,'d her nothing but her charming <HI>Trui|tone,</HI>
in all her Di&s;cour&s;e. And perceiving
that the &s;ecret Charms of the beauteous <HI>Florina,</HI>
had attracted the Affection of the whole King|dom,
through Envy was re&s;olv'd ro le&s;&s;en her
E&s;teem in the Eyes of her Father, and this
<PB N="27" REF="36">
&s;he did daily, by fal&s;e Accu&s;ations, Clamours,
dirty Redicules, and other Indecencies, unwor|thy
the Notice of the &s;weet-natur'd Prince&s;s,
who &s;trove to be above her Malice.</P>
<P>In a little time, there was News brought of
the Arrival of a mo&s;t gallant and magnificent
Prince, called, <HI>The charming King.</HI> The Queen
having heard the News, thought <HI>now</HI> was the
time to make her Daughter <HI>Tr$itone</HI> happy;
and therefore caus'd her to be deck'd with the
riche&s;t Ornaments that could be got; and or|der'd
all the brocado'd Silks, and Jewels of <HI>Flo|rina</HI>
to be lockt up: So that when the great
King had Audience, &s;he having nothing left
but an old Gown, thro' Mode&s;ty hid her&s;elf in
one Corner of the Room.</P>
<P>The <HI>Charming King</HI> was receiv'd with the ut|mo&s;t
Re&s;pect, when the Queen pre&s;ented him
her Daughter <HI>Truitone;</HI> but his Looks were not
plea&s;ant, he could &s;ee not$ing in her to Af|fect
him. The Queen perceiving him <HI>Chagrin,</HI>
&s;eem'd to take no Re&s;entment, but attributed,
it to his Mode&s;ty, and &s;o pa&s;t it by.</P>
<P>The <HI>Charming King</HI> had heard much of <HI>Flo|rina</HI>'s
Beauty, and looking about him, de&s;ir'd to
&s;ee t'other Prince&s;s, the King's own Daughter.
<HI>There &s;he is, &s;tanding in you Corner,</HI> &s;aid unman|nerly
<HI>Truitone.</HI> The King immediately addre&s;t
the blu&s;hing Prince&s;s, with &s;o much Re&s;pect
and Love, that the Queen could not forbear
di&s;cov'ring &s;ome Re&s;entment; and being exa&s;|perated
highly, prevail'd with the King to con|fine
<HI>Florina</HI> in a Ca&s;tle, &s;o long as the <HI>Charming
King</HI> &s;taid at Court.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="37">
To render all things to her Mind, &s;he had
order'd the <HI>Charming King</HI>'s Attendance, to &s;ay
every thing that was ba&s;e and &s;candalous of
<HI>Florina,</HI> and to make him believe, if po&s;&s;ible,
that &s;he was one of the mo&s;t &s;ordid, ill-natur'd
<HI>Coquettes</HI> in the Kingdom. But the <HI>Charming
King</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;t with another Belief, his Affe|ctions
were already &s;etled; and he told tho&s;e
that gave her this bad Character, That he had
no other <HI>Faith,</HI> than that it was the Con|trivance
of her&s;elf, and deformed Daughter
<HI>Truitone,</HI> who&s;e Memory, much more Sight,
was his greate&s;t Torment. And that, on 'tother
hand, the Perfections of the mo&s;t beautiful
Prince&s;s <HI>Florina,</HI> could only compleat his Hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>When they had told this to the Queen, &s;he
was in &s;uch Confu&s;ion, that &s;he vow'd Revenge
to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the impri&s;on'd Prince&s;s
was bemoaning her hard Fate, and much more
the ab&s;ence of the <HI>Charming King,</HI> who had al|ready
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd her Heart. She cry'd and wept
bitterly, and often threw out Invectives again&s;t
that innocent Beauty of hers, which had thus
inthrall'd her.</P>
<P>The Queen at the &s;ame time was al&s;o plot|ting
how to bring over the <HI>Charming King,</HI>
and therefore &s;ent him &s;ome of the riche&s;t Pre|&s;ents
in the World, reque&s;ting him to be the
Lady's Champion that &s;ent them. Among
the re&s;t was, <HI>The Order of Love</HI>'s <HI>Knighthood,</HI>
which was a Golden Heart, &s;et with many
Diamond Dartt about it, and pierced with an
<PB N="29" REF="38">
Arrow, bearing vi&s;ibly this Motto:
<Q>Wounded but by One&punc;</Q></P>
<P>Likewi&s;e a Book Bound in a Gold Cover,
containing the Laws of that Order. In &s;hort,
there was never an Emperor before able to make
&s;uch a Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Charming King</HI> was ravi&s;h'd with it, and
the more when he fancied it came from the
Pince&s;s <HI>Florina,</HI> of who&s;e Impri&s;onment he
wras hitherto ignorant. But when he was told,
that it came from <HI>Truitone,</HI> he &s;aid to the Me&s;|&s;engers,
<HI>No: I'll be none of her Champion; it is
incon&s;i&s;tent with my Honour to be at the di&s;po&s;al
of tho&s;e I can't fancy; therefore thank your Mi|&s;tre&s;s
in my Name, and take back the Pre&s;ents
again.</HI></P>
<P>Never did Envy and Malice rage more, than
in the Brea&s;ts of the Queen and <HI>Truitone:</HI> They
took this Re&s;u&s;al with the utmo&s;t Frenzy, and
would if po&s;&s;ible have bur&s;t at the Thought$
of the <HI>Charming King</HI>'s Affection for <HI>Florina.</HI>
And when they &s;aw him approach, enquiring
peremptorily where <HI>Florina</HI> was, the Queen,
told him, with &s;omething of Warmth, that it
was the King her Husband's Plea&s;ure, that &s;he
&s;hould not be &s;een, 'till her Daughter <HI>Truitone</HI>
was married.</P>
<P>At this &s;mart <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> the King, with an
Air of Indifference, gave both of them an
unwelcome Look, and without Ceremony,
left them to their own ba&s;e Genius.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="39">
When he had retir'd, and had lei&s;ure to
think, it came into his mind, to Bribe &s;ome of
the Prince&s;s's Maids, to come to a Sight of <HI>Flo|rina;</HI>
and intimating this De&s;ign of his to a
young Nobleman that attended him, they &s;oon
procur'd one, who promis'd to take npon her
the Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>But, ah! the Wretch was fal&s;e: She gave in|telligence
of all to the Queen, and this brought
about the fir&s;t Misfortune to the <HI>Charming King.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Truitone.</HI> being told his Intentions, order'd
the fal&s;e Confident to proceed, and tell him,
That he &s;hould be ble&s;s'd with an Hour's Con|ver&s;ation
with her at Night, through a little
Window; but withal to charge him, as he va|lu'd
his Life, to keep it Secret.</P>
<P>The King rejoyc'd exceedingly, and long'd
till Night came, whil&s;t the Queen had order'd
her Daughter <HI>Truitone,</HI> to per&s;onate the Prince&s;s
and gave her In&s;tructions accordingly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Charming King,</HI> at the time prefixt, was
conducted thither, and there in whi&s;p'ring Ac|cents,
expre&s;s'd his Affections to the Counterfeit
<HI>Florina,</HI> which &s;he as gladly receiv'd. He told
her, he would contrive her E&s;cape, and be&s;tow
on her two Diadems, his Heart and Crown; and
to a&s;&s;ure her of his Con&s;tancy, gave her a Dia|mond
Ring, as a Pledge of his royal Promi&s;e.
<HI>Truitone</HI> counterfeited Tears and Sighs, and
faintly told him, &s;he would be at his Di&s;po&s;al,
provided it conduc'd with his own Safety.</P>
<P>The <HI>Charming King,</HI> pleas'd with his Conver|&s;ation,
had &s;taid &s;o long, the Day-light put him
in mind to with-draw; &s;o that he took his
<PB N="31" REF="40">
leave for that time, with her con&s;ent to receive
another Vi&s;it from him in the &s;ame place, the
next Day.</P>
<P>As angry as the Queen and <HI>Truitone</HI> had been
hitherto, now they &s;eem'd as joyful; and the
Night appointed being come, the <HI>Charming
King</HI> had got ready a Chariot drawn by flying
Frogs; and repairing to the Ca&s;tle, found his
&s;uppo&s;ed Prince&s;s ready, at a Window de&s;ign|edly
left open. In a Minute he took her in his
Arms, and &s;eating her in the Coach, ask'd her
in what place &s;he would have the Marriage
con&s;umated. The Counterfeited reply'd, if he
thought fit, it might be at her <HI>Fairy</HI> God-mo|thers,
who liv'd in a Ca&s;tle not far off. Be it
&s;o <HI>&s;aid the Charming King,</HI> to his Cour&s;ers; who
no &s;ooner heard where they &s;hould take their

<P>When <HI>Truitone</HI> had privately confer'd with

<P>The <HI>Blew-Bird,</HI> to make the time le&s;s tedious,

Pendants, a rich Watch in a Pearl,
Bodkins, Necklaces, Jewels, and every thing

how he became transform'd, and the occa&s;ion

but by Virtue of his Styptick Charms, &s;taunch'd

<P>The <HI>Blew-Bird</HI> own'd all this; yet could not

with the Enchanter to keep him &s;afe in a Cage,

freed from the many Dangers he was at pre&s;ent
expos'd to.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s <HI>Florina</HI> not hearing any thing

took her by the Hair of the Head, and da&s;h'd

unknown.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Enchanter, who was
in pain for the royal Bird in the Cage, took a
Journey to the Fairy <HI>Sou&s;&s;io,</HI> to try if he could

Shape.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="53">

<P>Things being thus &s;ettled, the Necromancer$

<P>All this time, the Prince&s;s <HI>Florina,</HI> di&s;guis'd

goes to Church to be Married to the Lady
<HI>Truitone.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Florina</HI> heard this, &s;he fell into &s;uch an
Agony, that &s;he had much ado to &s;urvive the
News.</P>
<P>Well, upon &s;econd Thoughts, &s;he overcame
her Grief, and &s;tifled her Re&s;entments for that
time; not forgetting inwardly to reproach him
for his Perfidy, who was thus going to Reward
her for all the Troubles &s;he had labour'd un|der
for his &s;ake.</P>
<P>She took a mean Lodging, went to Bed Sup|perle&s;s
and by break of Day, went to the Tem|ple;
where with much Difficulty &s;he got in,
and beheld two Imphrial Thrones, one for the
King, and t'other for ugly <HI>Truitone.</HI></P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ion had like to have made a Di&s;covery,
but &s;till &s;he commanded her&s;elf, and went and
&s;tood by the Throne of her Rivale&s;s. Imme|diately
in comes the charming King, more char|ming
than ever, and the ugly <HI>Truitone</HI> as ill|natur'd
as ever, tho' in a magnificent Dre&s;s:
For, &s;he had no &s;ooner &s;een the di&s;gui&s;ed <HI>Queen</HI>
but the &s;nappi&s;h Bea&s;t wa&s;pi&s;hly cry'd, What
Trollop art thou, Hu&s;&s;y, that &s;tande&s;t &s;o near
my Throne?</P>
<P>I am come with a great many Rarities to
Tell you, Madam (&s;aid the Queen) and I go by
<PB N="48" REF="57">
the Name of Gammar <HI>Souillon:</HI> And out &s;he

<P>Fine Knick-knacks indeed (&s;aid <HI>Truitone</HI>)
worth Ten Shillings the Pair; Ha, Gammar
<HI>Souillon,</HI> Ha!</P>
<P>You wrong your Judgment (cryes the Qu.)
pray Madam &s;how 'em to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>So the Bea&s;t follow'd her Directions, and
went to the King's Throne with them. The
King remembred the Bracelets he had be&s;tow'd
on <HI>Florina;</HI> and his Colour came and went
&s;urpri&s;ingly: But &s;etting a good Face on't,
he told <HI>Truitone,</HI> that he had &s;uch a Pair once,
more valuable than a Kingdom, but that there
were more of the &s;ame, he could never yet
learn.</P>
<P>With this An&s;wer &s;he return'd to <HI>Florina,</HI>
and &s;aid, Well, Gammar, what mu&s;t you have?</P>
<P>They're unvaluable, &s;aid &s;he, yet I de&s;ire but
one Night's Lodging for them, in the Cabinet
of <HI>Eccho's.</HI></P>
<P>Ay, marry, and welcome, &s;aid <HI>Truitone,</HI> that
you &s;hall have. And &s;o gave Orders accord|ingly.</P>
<P>By the way you mu&s;t know, That this Ca|binet
of Eccho's was a Contrivance &s;o ingeni|ous,
that the &s;ofte&s;t Whi&s;per in it might be
heard in the King's Bed-Chamber; and of this
Cabinet the charming King had told the fair
<HI>Florina</HI> formerly, &s;o that it came into her Head
now, that here &s;he might reproach him for his
unfaithfulne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="58">
But here an unlucky Accident happen'd.
The King grieving for <HI>Florina,</HI> was grown &s;o
re&s;tle&s;s and watchful, that he could not Sleep
without Opium; &s;o that all her Complaints,
with her Bracelets, were thrown away in vain.
An Accident unknown to <HI>Florina,</HI> and which
the more augmented her Sorrows; &s;he being
ignorant whether the King had heard her, or
not. But which way to get another Night's
Lodging in the Chamber of Eccho's, &s;he could
not tell, her Bracelets being gone.</P>
<P>A little &s;tudy put her in mind of her Egg-Experiments;
and to work &s;he went with the
third Egg, and broke it, which produc'd a mo&s;t
charming Coach of poli&s;h'd Steel, inlaid with
curious Figures of Gold. But that which was
mo&s;t admirable, was its being drawn by &s;ix
milk-white Mice, harne&s;s'd with Green, having
for their Charioteer and Po&s;tilion, two well|complection'd
young Rats, who&s;e Livery was
rich Ro&s;e-colour'd brocado'd Silk.</P>
<P>In the Coach &s;ate Four of the mo&s;t beautiful
Puppets in the Univer&s;e. All the <HI>European</HI>
Fairs could not furni&s;h the like; They would
Dance upon a Spider's Web, and throw them|&s;elves
thro' the Eye of a Stocking-Needle. 'Tis
a folly to talk of the Agility and Parts of this
Company; they mu&s;t be well-bred, to be&s;ure,
and of good Families.</P>
<P>The Queen was extream glad, the breaking
the third Egg &s;hould produce a Rarity &s;o ex|traordinary;
and was re&s;olv'd to let <HI>Truitone</HI>
be the fir&s;t that &s;hould &s;ee it. She therefore
watch'd <HI>Truitone</HI>'s walking in the Park; and
<PB N="50" REF="59">
when &s;he &s;aw her enter, &s;he &s;et the little Mice
a galloping, with the Chariot and Company
after it.</P>
<P>The ugly <HI>Truitone</HI> no &s;ooner &s;aw it, but be|liev'd

perceiv'd the Queen given them Directions.</P>
<P>Hah Gammar <HI>Souillon</HI> (&s;aid &s;he) you have

<P>No$ I, by my troth Madam (&s;aid the Queen)
nothing le&s;s than another Night's Lodging in
the Chamb$r of Eceho's.</P>
<P>Thou &s;halt not want that (<HI>&s;aid &s;he</HI>) and
turning about, laughing to her Maids, call'd
her a &s;illy Fool,</P>
<P>Having taken up her Lodging that Night in
the Chamber of Eccho's, &s;he made mo&s;t lamen|table
Complaints to move the charming King
to Compa&s;&s;ion: But the &s;econd Night was
un&s;ucce&s;sful like the fir&s;t; the King having
taken <HI>Opium</HI> that Night al&s;o.</P>
<P>Oh, what Torment was poor <HI>Florina</HI> under
at this Di&s;appointment! She had but one Egg
left, and if that did not take effect, &s;he was
&s;ure to be mi&s;erable for ever. Break it &s;he was
re&s;olv'd, and &s;o with a mighty force threw it
on the Table, when behold, in&s;tead of the Egg
was found a charming Pa&s;ty, with half a Do|zen
Birds in it, &s;inging in a mo&s;t plea&s;ant and
wonderful manner, notwith&s;tanding they had
been &s;ufficiently baked.</P>
<P>This was no &s;ooner done, but one of the
King's Pages came by, and &s;eeing her, cry'd,
Hah! Gammar <HI>Souillon,</HI> if the King had not

&s;hall take no <HI>Opium</HI> this Night, and thou &s;halt
have all the&s;e Riches, pulling out a Handful of
Diamonds.&mdash;The Page made no more ado,
but gladly took them, and gave her a faithful
Promi&s;e it &s;hould be &s;o.</P>
<P>He was no &s;ooner gone, but <HI>Truitone</HI> came
by with her Maids; and &s;eeing <HI>Florina</HI> with
&s;uch an odd &s;ort of a Pye, cating part of it,
as &s;he &s;uppos'd, was greatly &s;urpriz'd for the

<P>But de&s;irous to know what My&s;tery &s;he was

<P>I am making a Breakfa&s;t of <HI>Phy&s;icians, Mu|&s;icians,</HI>

<P>In &s;hort <HI>Truitone</HI> was &s;o taken with this plea|&s;ant

in the Chamber of Eccho's, &s;he gave Gammar
<HI>Souillon</HI> a Broad-Piece of Gold for it.</P>
<P><HI>Florina</HI> long'd for Night, and when it came,
took up her Lodging in the Chamber as u&s;ual.
Having drawn from the bottom of her Heart$
<PB N="52" REF="61">
a Sigh &s;o va&s;t, that none but a Soul like hers,
could contain it, &s;he began her Complaint in
the following Words.</P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, that a Prince&s;s who had no
other Heart to di&s;po&s;e of, than what I have &s;a|crific'd
for you a thou&s;and times, &s;hould be
thus flighted at la&s;t? Can you be &s;o forget|ful

our Window-Amours, my Impri&s;on|ments,

<HI>Truitone</HI> mu&s;t Rival one you re&s;olv'd never to
abandon? O infatuated King! O too con|&s;tant,
but unfortunate <HI>Florina!</HI></P>
<P>Every Word that &s;he &s;aid, was di&s;tinctly
heard by the King. He knew it to be <HI>Florina</HI>'s
Voice, and his Soul was upon the Rack. He
cry'd out, and complain'd of the di&s;mal Mis|fortunes
that &s;eparated them, and laid as much
to her Charge, as &s;he could do to his.</P>
<P><HI>Florina</HI> &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with a &s;ecret Joy
that the King had heard her, cry'd out, Mo&s;t
<HI>Charming King!</HI> Would you be informed more
of <HI>Florina?</HI> Have the Courage then, to &s;end
for Gammar <HI>Souillon.</HI></P>
<P>The King &s;ent for her according$y, and was
told &s;he was in the Cabinet of Eccho's. He
went thither, and there found to his A&s;toni&s;h|ment,
the beautiful <HI>Florina</HI> lying on a Couch,
with all her u&s;ual Charms, and &s;everal Lamps
burning before her, which di&s;cover'd two of the
mo&s;t perfect Alters Love ever erected.</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;h'd King approach'd her, whil&s;t
&s;he lay trembling, tho not afraid. He &s;aw
<PB N="53" REF="62">
'twas his Prince&s;s, and threw him&s;elf at her
Feet, and ki&s;s'd her Hands a Thou&s;and Times.
The Prince&s;s fix'd her Eyes on him, and at that
very Iu&s;tant the Memory of all Misfortunes was
lo&s;t. They were Lovers indeed; they recipro|cally
forgave each other, and buried in Obil|vion
all their Mi&s;tru&s;ts and Jealou&s;ies. So that
they wanted nothing now to compleat their
Happine&s;s, but to free them&s;elves of the Fairy
<HI>Sou&s;&s;io.</HI></P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of their Con&s;ultations, advice
was brought of a certain Enchanter's being ar|riv'd
at Court. The King admitted him his
Pre&s;ence, and found him to be his old Friend,
who had brought with him a Fairy from the
farthe&s;t parts of the Earth.</P>
<P>After a little Di&s;cour&s;e, they told his Maje|&s;ty,
That they had prevented the threat'ning
Danger of <HI>Sou&s;&s;io;</HI> and that he and <HI>Florina</HI>
might now begin to map the Fruition of an
uninterrupted Love; for nothing could hurt
them.</P>
<P>News was no &s;ooner &s;pread at Court, but
the Hearts of the People were over-joyful; and
every one was plea&s;ed with the Prince&s;s, who&s;e

<P><HI>Truitone</HI> by this time had been informed of
<HI>Florina</HI>'s being with the King, and was running
with open Mouth to Reproach him, but the

they de&s;ervedly turned her into a <HI>Sow,</HI> agreea|ble

<P>ONCE upon a Time, there liv'd a King

<P>The indulgent Queen (as too many Mothers
in this Age) lov'd him beyond Expre&s;&s;ion: So
that &s;he was hood-winkt to his ill Qualities,
and thought every Imperfection in him Agree|able
and Plea&s;ing. And that he might com|mand
both Re&s;pect and Fear as he grew up,
gave him the Name of <HI>Furibon.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the King his Father made
choice of a Nobleman, related to the Crown,
to be his Governour, who had a Son nam'd
<HI>Leander,</HI> that was the greate&s;t Ornament of the

belov'd.</P>
<P><HI>Furibon</HI> perceiving <HI>Leander</HI> had more re&s;pect
than him&s;elf, began to Envy his Happine&s;s;
and the more, &s;ince he was courted by all the
Ladies of Quality, who had given him the Ti|tle
of <HI>The Fair Indifferent;</HI> a Name which <HI>Le|ander</HI>
had ju&s;tly merited, by not fixing his Affe|ctions

<P>The Malice of <HI>Furibon</HI> increa&s;ing, <HI>Leander</HI>'s

<P>One Day, as <HI>Leander</HI> was &s;itting in an Ar|bour,
playing upon a Flute, a beautiful Snake
flew directly to him, and twi&s;ted her&s;elf about
his Leg. <HI>Leander</HI> was going to kill it, but the

her up, and carry'd her to his own Apartment,
where he daily fed her with his own Hand.</P>
<P><HI>Furibon</HI> being told by &s;ome of his Flatterers,

<P>The cockering Queen took his part, and ad|vis'd

<HI>Furibon</HI> the next Day follow'd her Advice, when

him, &s;he &s;aid no more, but wi&s;h'd him
Succe&s;s, and in&s;tantly vani&s;h'd.</P>
<P>Now, thought <HI>Leander</HI> to him&s;elf, I am hap|py;
to Court I will go, and there exerci&s;e my
innocent Mirth upon the ungrateful <HI>Furibon.</HI></P>
<P>He did accordingly; but upon his arrival,
he was very much &s;urpriz'd to hear that <HI>Furibon</HI>
was then with his Father, complaining that
<PB N="61" REF="70">
<HI>Leander</HI> had contriv'd to murder him as went
a Hunting.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he &s;tood hearing the&s;e Fal&s;ities, one
of the King's Me&s;&s;engers came and carried him
before his Maje&s;ty, and the lying Prince. Re|venge
thy &s;elf on him, &s;aid the King to his Son
<HI>Furibon</HI> But being afraid to look him in the
Face, he turn'd Tail, and ran to his Mother for
help.</P>
<P>The Queen &s;oon po&s;ted to the King, to con|&s;er
with him about <HI>Leander;</HI> and the coward|ly
Monkey, her Son, minding to hear what &s;he
&s;aid, had laid his Ear to the Key-hole of the
Door. <HI>Leander</HI> no &s;ooner perceiv'd this, but
he put on his invi&s;ible Red Cap, and taking a
Hammer and Nails that lay by him, tack'd his
Ear fa&s;t to the Door.</P>
<P>The Boy <HI>Furibon</HI> feeling the Smart, fell a
roaring and bellowing like a Hog; and his out|cries
reaching the Queen'$ Ears, &s;he flew from
the King, and bur&s;ting open the Door, tore her
Son's Ear from his Head.</P>
<P>The Queen was out of her Wits at the Sight,
the Blood ran down from his Head, as if it fell
from a &s;tuck Pig; and nothing but howling
was heard.</P>
<P>Well, at la&s;t with much ado&punc; the Sow took up
her Pig's Ear; for <HI>Leander</HI> (who was now a
<HI>Goblin</HI>) had flaug'd her Hands, and the Boy's
No&s;e all the time: So that there was &s;uch an
$outcry of Murder! Murder! the whole Court
$ung with it, The Servants came, and the King
al&s;o, but &s;eeing no body touch them, he thought
they were both mad, or the Devil was in 'em.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="71">
<HI>Leaender</HI> in the mean time was got into the
Queen's Fruit-Garden, in his own Shape, pul|ling
down the choice&s;t Fruits and Flowers, and
throwing them about the Walks; and for any
but the Royal Blood to do this, was imme|diate
Death.</P>
<P>The Gardener perceiving it, went pre&s;ently
and told the Queen of it, who &s;ent her Son with
a Band of Soldiers, to bring him by force be|fore
her. <HI>Leander</HI> no &s;ooner &s;aw this, but o$
went his invi&s;ible Cap, ju&s;t as <HI>Furibon</HI> was co|ming
to him, and taking up a round Pebble
hurl'd it at the Monkey-Prince, and broke hi$
Arm. Then he hamper'd his Legs &s;o fa&s;t, that
he fell down among the Gravel, and mangled
all his Face. As for the Soldiers, he flung al$
the Queen's ripe Oranges at them; &s;ometime$
&s;howing him&s;elf, and &s;ometimes not: So that
they were glad to get away as well as they
could.</P>
<P>When he had &s;ufficiently pleas'd him&s;elf with
this Diver&s;ion, he was re&s;olv'd to leave the
Court, unknown to any of his Servants; and
mounting next Morning his tru&s;ty Steed <HI>Gris-de-lin,</HI>
he rode 'till he came to a very &s;pacious
Wood.</P>
<P>As he pa&s;t thro' this Thicket, he heard the
mo&s;t dolorous Complaints expre&s;&s;ible; and ca|&s;ting
his Eyes ronud, he &s;aw a young Gentle|man
undergoing all the Afflictions of a de&s;pe|rate
Mind.</P>
<P>Mov'd with this Sight, <HI>Leander</HI> beg'd the
Rea&s;on of his Grief, and proffer'd him his A&s;|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="72">
Ah, Sir! <HI>&s;aid the Unknown,</HI> this very Morning
is to be torn from my Embraces, one that loves
me above all the World; and &s;he is now pre|paring
to be &s;acrific'd by her Parents to Avarice
and Age, in a Ca&s;tle at the end of this Wood.</P>
<P>Say you &s;o, Sir, &s;aid the generous <HI>Leander;</HI>
&s;tay till I come back, and be confident I'll
relieve you.</P>
<P><HI>Leander</HI> put Spurs to his Hor&s;e, and made
directly to the Ca&s;tle, where he found all things
i$ a readine&s;s for Marriage, the Mu&s;ick play|ing,
Trumpets &s;ounding, and a general Mirth
throughout the whole place. <HI>Gris-de-lin</HI> being
$ty'd to a Tree, on went the little invi&s;ible
r$d Cap, and <HI>Leander</HI> was immediately a <HI>Gob|lin</HI></P>
<P>When all the Company we$e &s;eated at Ta|ble,
the <HI>Goblin</HI> hid him&s;elf among them. His
Eye$ were perpetually on the Bride, and ob|$erv'd
her Heart to be far remote from that
place. He now thought it high time to di&s;turb
their Mirth&punc; and therefore flew immediately to
her Mother's Seat, and whi&s;per'd thus in her
Ear.</P>
<P>If thy Daughter is married to that old Wretch,
$n le&s;s than a Week thou &s;halt die!</P>
<P>The good old Woman fell into a Fit upon
it; but coming to her&s;elf, &s;he declar'd, That
$f they proceeded any farther in marrying her
Daughter, &s;he &s;hould not &s;urvive it a Week
longer.</P>
<P>This mu&s;t needs be a great Surprize to the
Husband; however looking upon it to be but a
Whim&s;ey of the Brain, he call'd his Wife Sim|pleton,
<PB N="64" REF="73">
and &s;aid, that &s;ome old, cobling A&s;tro|loger,
had infus'd &s;uch Notions into her Head,
and made a mere Ridicule of what &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P><HI>Leander</HI> upon this, flyes to the old Dotard's
Ear, and &s;aid:</P>
<P>If you will not believe your Wife, and break off
the Match, you &s;hall dye before her!</P>
<P>The old Man hearing this, and knowing him|&s;elf
unprepar'd to leave the World, without any
more ado, di&s;mi&s;s'd the aged Mi&s;er to make
the be&s;t of his Fortune, who took his Leave
without Ceremony, but left a great many
Cur&s;es behind him.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Leander</HI> enjoin'd the Parents to marry
their Daughter to her fir&s;t Lover in the Wood.
Accordingly he was &s;ent for, and married they
were; when <HI>Leander</HI> took his leave of them,
and went in &s;earch of fre&s;h Adventures.</P>
<P>Having travelled till he came to a &s;pacious
large City, he became acquainted with a cer|tain
Lady named <HI>Blondina;</HI> but ob&s;erving
&s;omething of Levity in her Conver&s;ation, made
tryal of his Ro&s;ey Experiment, and watching
an Opportunity when &s;he was a&s;leep, laid it
gently upon her Neck, when it &s;oon wither'd
and lo&s;t it's Beauty.</P>
<P>By this he di&s;covered, that <HI>Blondina</HI> carried
two Faces, and was in Love with another;
and to know the whole matter, wi&s;h'd him&s;elf
one time in <HI>Blondina's</HI> Bed-Chamber, where he
found an aukward, Country Cat-Gut Scraper,
making his Addre&s;&s;es to her.</P>
<P>In my Fairy's Name, &s;aid <HI>Leander,</HI> I'll not
&s;uffer this: So he took him by the Throat, and
<PB N="65" REF="74">
flung him cut of the Window, by which Fall
the caterwauling Fidler had his Teeth beat out,
and his Fiddle broke to pieces.</P>
<P>The next Exploit <HI>Leander</HI> perform'd, was
this:</P>
<P>After he had &s;ufficiently reproach'd the in|con&s;tant
<HI>Blondina,</HI> he went to another City,
where he &s;aw a Virgin going with all the u&s;ual
Ceremonies to a Nunnery, but with the utmo&s;t
unwilllingne&s;s a dejected Face could expre&s;s.</P>
<P>He no &s;ooner &s;aw her led by her two Bro|thers,
wich her Mother following after, but he
cry'd out with a loud Voice, De&s;i&s;t you barba|rous
Brethren, or el&s;e 'tis Heaven's Will you
&s;hall be &s;queez'd to Atoms.</P>
<P>The Voice was like Thunder, and the Peo|ple
were a&s;toni&s;h'd at it; but the Brothers per|&s;i&s;ted,
and &s;aid, it was nothing but the Noi&s;e
of her Sweet-heart, who had hid him&s;elf for
that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>A Quarter-Staff lying by, <HI>Leander</HI> took it
up, and belabour'd them both &s;o heartily, that
they and all the Company were forc'd to retire
with precipitation, and leave the Virgin with
the Goblin, and her Lover that was among the
Crowd in di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Leander</HI> perceiving this, re&s;um'd his Shape,
and mode&s;tly reque&s;ted the Virgin to accept of
his Service.</P>
<P>The Tran&s;ports of Joy &s;he was in, to &s;ee her
&s;elf free, oblig'd her to tell him in &s;hort, That
having given her Heart, and promis'd to marry
that Chevalier (pointing to him) who had no
con&s;iderable Fortune; 'twas for that rea&s;on
<PB N="66" REF="75">
her Relations were then carrying her by vio|lence
into a Nunnery.</P>
<P>Say you &s;o, beautiful Virgin, cry'd the ge|nerous
<HI>Leander,</HI> their Fortunes have for&s;ook
them, and 'tis no more in their power to &s;epa|rate
your Affections. You &s;hall never want
Wealth to compleat your Happine&s;s.&mdash;With
that he &s;hook his Ro&s;e between them, till
there was Gold &s;ufficient to maintain Ten o$
the riche&s;t Peers in the Land. Take that, faith|ful
Couple (<HI>&s;aid he</HI>) marry, and be happy for$
ever.&mdash;And &s;o he left them, wi&s;hing him|&s;elf
in another place.</P>
<P>In his Way thro' a large Forre&s;t, he heard a$
Virgin cry out &s;o piteou&s;ly, that the Air ec|cho'd
with her Complaints. Looking wi&s;tfully
round him, he &s;aw four Ruffians haling an in|nocent
Virgin into the Wood. <HI>Leander</HI> was
as quick as Thought till he came up with them.
Hey day, (<HI>reply'd he</HI>) What hurt have the&s;e in|nocent
Years done, that &s;he mu&s;t be treated
thus? I command you to let her alone.</P>
<P>Yes, by all means, for&s;ooth (&s;aid they) Mr.
Hubble-Bubble.</P>
<P>Well then, cry'd the Prince, I'll make you;
So he jumpt off his Hor&s;e, and put on his invi|&s;ible
Cap. The Rogues thought he was quite
gone, and had left his Hor&s;e to their Mercy;
but they were wofully mi&s;taken, for the Gob|lin
&s;oon &s;eiz'd him that held her, and ty'd him
to a Tree, whil&s;t the re&s;t were in vain pur&s;ui$
of his Steed <HI>Gri&s;delin.</HI></P>
<P>The nimble-footed Bea&s;t having tir'd and al|mo&s;t
blinded his pur&s;uers, by kicking Sand and
<PB N="67" REF="76">
Gravel in their Eyes; one of them gave over the
Cha&s;e, and return'd back; who no &s;ooner &s;aw
his Companion in this Condition, but he fell
into a Pa&s;&s;ion, and call'd him Fool, Blockhead,
Puppy, Coward, and what not? Suppo&s;ing
he had &s;uffer'd the Virgin to bind him in that
manner; there being no Body, as he thought,
to a&s;&s;i&s;t her; giving him withal, &s;everal &s;evere
Thuacks over the Shoulders, for his &s;uppo&s;ed
Cowardice.</P>
<P>The Goblin having &s;ufficiently laugh'd at this
Adventure, &s;eiz'd the other, and bound him to
another Tree, directly before his Companion's
Face.</P>
<P>Heav'ns! What better Sport, than to &s;ee
this Fellow rail'd at by his Comrade? He &s;pit
at him, he hal'd to him, and cry'd out, You va|liant
Fellow, you Ra&s;cal, you Puppy-Dog, why
don't you come, and correct my Cowardice
now? But alas! his oppo&s;ite was out of Coun|tenance;
and having nothing to &s;ay, hung his
Head like a Bull-ru&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Abricotina</HI> (for &s;o was the Virgin's Name)
having made her e&s;cape, <HI>Leander</HI> was re&s;olv'd
to find her cut, and learn the Hi&s;tory of her
Misfortunes. His Steed returning, he &s;oon re|$ounted,
at that in&s;tant the other two Ruffins
came in, which <HI>Gri&s;delin</HI> no &s;ooner perceiv'd,
$ut he flung up his two hindermo&s;t Heels, and
$ickt their Guts out, leaving the other two
$ogues to dye with hungry Bellies.</P>
<P><HI>Leander</HI> having not rid far from the place,
$ut he overtook <HI>Abricotina,</HI> who being weary
$nd faint, was refre&s;hing her&s;elf under a Tree.
<PB N="68" REF="77">
At fir&s;t &s;ight of the Steed, &s;he thought her&s;elf
happy; for &s;he had a &s;trong Fancy that <HI>Gri&s;|delin</HI>
was coming to carry he$ to the Palace of
Love and Plea&s;ure, though &s;he &s;aw no body on
his back.</P>
<P>The <HI>Goblin</HI> knew well her Mind, and riding
up to her, took her in his Arms, and &s;et her be|fore
him. Then putting Spurs to his little Nag,
and pulling off his red Cap he became vi&s;ible.
<HI>Abricotina</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing him a <HI>Spirit,</HI> would have
&s;tarted from him, had not he held her fa&s;t.</P>
<P>Ah, Madam, (<HI>&s;aid he</HI>) do you fear your De|liverer?</P>
<P>No, Sir. (<HI>cry'd &s;he;</HI>) but I tremble at the
thoughts of a Spirit.</P>
<P>I am none, you may feel, (reply'd he) there|fore
abandon all &s;uch Thoughts. I am ready
to carry you in Safety where-ever you plea&s;e:
Let me intreat you therefore, in the mean time
to let me under&s;tand the ri&s;e of your Misfor|tunes.</P>
<P>To pa&s;s away the time, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I cannot in
Gratitude deny the Reque&s;t of one I owe &s;o
much to.</P>
<P>Know then, Sir, <HI>continu'd &s;he,</HI> that many
Years &s;ince, one of the mo&s;t eminent of the Fai|ries
was &s;o weak, as to marry a Prince contrary
to all Laws, Remon&s;trances, and Per&s;ua&s;ions
of the Order of Fairyi&s;m; for which &s;he was
expel'd their Society.</P>
<P>It fell out, that the Prince her Husband, in
&s;ome time, grew &s;ick of her Conver&s;ation, there
not being an Action of his, any where, but
&s;he pre&s;ently knew it; and which &s;he made u&s;e
<PB N="69" REF="78">
of, to render his Life unea&s;y where-ever he
went.</P>
<P>'Tir'd with this way of living, he private|ly
retir'd to a loan&s;ome Cell, &s;ome thou&s;and
Miles di&s;tant from home, and where, as he
thought, it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to find him,
But alas! the Project was weak; for &s;he was a
univer&s;al Fairy, who held intelligence in all
parts of the Earth.</P>
<P>The Prince had not left her three Days, but
&s;he found her&s;elf with Child by him: In this
condition &s;he doubled her Revenge, and calling
to an invi&s;ible Eagle, &s;he flew with it directly
to her Husband's Den.</P>
<P>The Fairy no &s;ooner &s;aw him, but &s;he flung
her&s;elf at his Feet, and &s;aid;</P>
<P>Sweet Prince, behold thy <HI>Fairy</HI> Prince&s;s, who&s;e
pregnant Womb is now with Child of thy own Image&punc;
be per&s;uaded to go back with me, and you &s;hall have
whatever you de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Thus &s;he lay intreating him with all the al|$uring
Expre&s;&s;ions &s;he could invent: But
finding him deaf to her Per&s;ua&s;ions, and ob&s;ti|$ately
bent never to live with her more, &s;he

<Q><L>Nothing vexeth a Woman mo&s;t.</L>
<L>But when her Expectation's lost.&mdash;</L></Q>

'till the Cholick &s;eiz'd her, and put her in mind
of returning Home.</P>
<P>Well (<HI>&s;aid &s;he, rallying once more</HI>) If I had
a mind to revenge my &s;elf on thee, thou cruel One,
I could immediately transform thee into a Viper,
Cat, Tead, or Hog; nay, make thee a <HI>Cucum|ber,</HI>
to become the Excrements of a Prick-Lou&s;e
<HI>Taylor:</HI> But &s;tay where thou art; and let $word$
Puni&s;hment be to dwell among Scriech-Owls, and
other nocturnal Birds. <HI>And having &s;aid thus,
&s;he took to her Eagle, and in a Minute &s;lew
back to the Palace.</HI></P>
<P>She was no &s;ooner arriv'd; but &s;he di&s;mi&s;s'd
all her M$n-Servants, and took in their &s;tead,
a certyin Race of Women, call'd <HI>Amazone$</HI>
To the&s;e &s;he gave &s;trict Orders to repair to &s;e|veral
Pa&s;&s;es round the I&s;land, and not to le$

<P>Sometime afterwards, &s;he was deliver'd of $word$
Daughter, who, as &s;he grew up, became one $word$
the mo&s;t lovely Prince&s;&s;es in the World. Th$

and my Mi&s;tre&s;s the Queen of it: H$

<P><PB N="71" REF="82">
But, to come down $y the Cau&s;e of my late
Misfortune; you mu&s;t know (<HI>added &s;he</HI>) That
I had the keeping of all my Mi&s;tre&s;s's Birds;
and one Day, I was &s;o unfortunate as to let fly
a Parrot as dear to her, as her&s;elf. The Bird
was no &s;ooner flown, but apprehen&s;ive of &s;ome
&s;evere Puni&s;hment, I retir'd out of the I&s;land
in &s;earch of it.</P>
<P>Then it was that tho&s;e Villains &s;iezed me;
they hovering about the I&s;land, with Hopes to$
&s;teal away my Mi&s;tre&s;s, and carry her to an
ugly deformed Prince, call'd <HI>Furibon,</HI> who had
&s;een her Picture, and &s;ent them hither for that
purpo&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>And is impo&s;&s;ible for me (<HI>&s;aid</HI> Leander, <HI>inter|rupting
her</HI>) to gain admi&s;&s;ion? Is there no Way,
fair <HI>Abricotina?</HI></P>
<P>In my Opinion (<HI>&s;aid &s;he</HI>) there is no po&s;&s;i|bility.
Were it in my Power, I would effect
it; but I'm no more able to do it, than to make
a World.</P>
<P>I can enable you (<HI>cry'd</HI> Leander) &s;uffer me then,
to enter with you in the Habit of an <HI>Amazon,</HI>
which I can have at my Wi&s;$.</P>
<P>Forbid it Heav'ns! (<HI>cry'd &s;he</HI>) &s;uch an En|terprzie
would terminate in the Ruin of us both.
Better wou'd it be to forget the Thoughts of
this I&s;land, than to entertain what will only
prove anxious and unfortunate.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t they were thus di&s;cour&s;ing together,
they came to the Brink of a River, when <HI>Abri|cotina</HI>
&s;pringing from his Arms, threw her&s;elf
on t'othor &s;ide, and cry'd, Be haypy, generou$
Prince, where ever you go; and the whole

Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>And may you, &s;weet Virgin (<HI>&s;aid Leander</HI>) when

Heart.</P>
<P>They were not parted long, but <HI>Leander</HI> was
re&s;olv'd to wi&s;h him&s;elf in the I&s;land with her.
Accordingly he put on his little Red Cap, and
in an In&s;tant he was in the Palace of <HI>Calm De|lights.</HI>
He fonud the Palace was of pure Gold,
&s;tanding upon Chry&s;tal, in the middle whereof
the <HI>Graces</HI> kept Guard with admirable Order.
All the Wonders of the Four Elements, embe|li&s;h'd
it. Not a Man or Boy was to be &s;een;
the very Idea of that Sex being lo&s;t among 'em.
But there were infinite Numbers of the mo&s;t
beautiful Women that Nature could mould, all
gay and lively, as the Sun at its Creation. All
the Walls of the Appa$tments were built with
Diamonds and precious Stones. The Prince&s;s's
Bed-Chamber, was all of Chry&s;tal-Gla&s;s, and
ev'ry where expos'd to Sight, the Perfection of
the whole World. Her Throne &s;tood in the
concave of a large Pearl, about the bigne&s;s of
a <HI>Muskmellon,</HI> upon which &s;he &s;ate in State,
with her Maids about her.</P>
<P><HI>Leander</HI> being invi&s;ible, &s;aw all this; and as
he &s;tood admiring the Prince&s;s, Proclamation
was made, according to cu&s;tom, that her High|ne&s;s
was going to &s;peak, when immediately the
<HI>Graces</HI> came, and &s;eated them&s;elves upon her
Lips.</P>
<P>Looking round her with an Air of &s;erenity,
&s;he ask'd what was become of the Nymph
<PB N="73" REF="84">
<HI>Abricotina,</HI> that &s;he did not give her u&s;ual At|tendance?</P>
<P>An&s;wer was made, That &s;he had been &s;ought
carefully, but could not be found.</P>
<P>There being &s;everal <HI>Parrots</HI> in the Pre&s;ence-Chamber
at that time, <HI>Leander</HI> pre&s;ently mi|mick'd
$ne, and cry'd, Dear Prince&s;s, &s;he will
pre&s;ently be here, having narrowly e&s;c$p'd be|ing
carry'd away by &s;ome wicke$ Creatures,
c$ll'd <HI>Men,</HI> but was wonderfully pre&s;erv'd
by a young Prince, that came timely to her

<P>Ju&s;t as he had &s;aid this, in the Nymph came
and throwing her&s;elf at the Prince&s;s's Feet, up

a certain young Prince, with all the Charms
that Nature could be&s;tow on a Man, had re&s;|cu'd
her from Four Villains, who were carrying
her off. A Prince (<HI>added &s;he</HI>) who I could
have brought hither and lov'd, had I not been
enjoin'd to the contrary.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s being inwardly pleas'd at this
Relation, ask'd his Name, and place of Birth:
But the Nymph being ignorant, could not in|form
her of either: At which <HI>Leander</HI> began to
talk like a <HI>Parrot</HI> again, &s;aying; My charming
Prince&s;s, <HI>Abricotina</HI> is unkind, in not telling
your Highne&s;s; the &s;trange Prince will break

With the&s;e Words &s;he aro&s;e from her Throne,
and with a beauteous Tr$in of Nymphs, went
into the great Hall too Supper. At her coming
in, the Birds &s;et up their little Throats, and
&s;ung melodiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Leander</HI> having learn'd to imitate the
Birds in the Woods, could &s;ing better than the

a <HI>Canary</HI>-Bird's Note, the following Song.</P>
<Q><L>All our contended, bli&s;s$ul Days,</L>
<L>In Melancholly end,</L>
<L>If <HI>Love</HI> &s;hould not find Means and Ways,</L>

<L>Oh, beauteous Prince&s;s, then Embrace,</L>
<L>And nouri&s;h in your Arms,</L>

<L>With all it's fruitful Charms.</L></Q>
<P>To hear a <HI>Canary</HI>-Bird sing &s;o much, and &s;o
like a rational Creature, mu&s;t needs be very
&s;urprizing and diverting. The Prince&s;s ask'd
<HI>Abricotina,</HI> whether &s;he had in&s;tructed that Bird
or not. The Nymph an&s;wer'd her Mi&s;tri&s;s in
the Negative; but told her. She &s;aw no rea&s;on
but one Bird might have as much Wit as
another.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s, however, fancied &s;he had gi|ven
it &s;ome particular In&s;tructions, and &s;miling
to her&s;elf, took her place at the upper-end of
the Table.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="86">

to plu$k the Wing of a Hum-Bird out of

been at Plough.</P>
<P>When Supper was ended, the Prince&s;s was ob|&s;erv'd

Alas! they little thought who they had talk'd

<P>The Nymphs of Honour no &s;ooner perceiv'd

&s;ome Diver&s;ion: At the &s;ame time, in went
the Chariot, with a great Concour$e of Apes of
Quality, performing &s;uch merry Exploits, that
the Prince&s;s could hardly refrain Laughing;
and the more, when &s;he &s;aw the Chariot with|out

<Q>Within my Heart, thou better art,</Q>

<P>THERE was a Time when a King had

was finer than Gold; and for that rea&s;on &s;he
was call'd, <HI>The Beauty with Golden Locks.</HI></P>
<P>Upon her Father's Frontiers, dwelt a come|$$,
wealthy young Prince, who hearing of her

$word$ &s;ent an Emba&s;&s;ador, with a magnificent
$rain, to ask her in Marriage; not doubting
$word$ the beautiful Prince would embrace his
$ffer: But when the Emba&s;&s;ador arriv'd, and
$d Audience, he receiv'd no other An&s;wer,
$word$ Thanks from the prince&s;s for the Honour
$word$ Ma&s;te$ was pleas'd to do $$r; and that, at
$e&s;ent, &s;he had no Inclinati$$ to Marriage.</P>
<P>The Emba&s;&s;ador return'd $word$ with all the

$word$ Quantities of Diamonds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which &s;he had
<PB N="94" REF="105">
mode&s;tly refus'd; but to di&s;cover &s;omething of
her u&s;ual good Nature, &s;he made Choice only
of a Thou&s;and of Pins.</P>
<P>At his return to Court, every one was in
perplexity, particularly the King, who&s;e Affe|ction
for her was &s;o great, that it often drew
Tears from his Eyes.</P>
<P>A young Nobleman then in the Palace&punc;
nam'd <HI>Avenant,</HI> a Favourite at Court, of an$
admirable Wit, Shape, and Mein, talking with
&s;ome of the Courtiers about this Di&s;apoint|ment,
made &s;light of it, and accidentally $word$
drop the&s;e Words. <HI>If his Maje&s;ty had &s;ent $word$

if it had cost me my Life.</HI></P>

May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, (<HI>&s;aid they</HI>) You$
<HI>Avenant</HI> has ridicul'd your Maje&s;ty, prefer'd $word$

<P>The unfortunate <HI>Avenant</HI> pining in $word$

I offended the King? Would to Heaven $word$

<P><PB N="95" REF="106">
At that in&s;tant the King went by, and hear|ing

have per&s;uaded him from it. The King was
re&s;olute, and li&s;ten'd &s;o long 'till he wept.</P>
<P>Then his Maje&s;ty &s;ent for him out, and de|manded

<P>Sir, (<HI>&s;aid</HI> Avenant) my Accu&s;ations are fal&s;e,

<P>The King no &s;ooner heard him, but &s;aid, I
am &s;atisfy'd, faithful <HI>Avenant;</HI> and &s;o took
him into Favour again, whil&s;t his Enemies fell

The next Morning, having taken a private
Leave of the King, <HI>Avenant</HI> began his Journ|ey,
contemplating all the way how he &s;hould
bring this great Work about. Whatever came
into his Head of Moment; he minuted down
in his Table-Book; and he was one Morning
ar this Exerci&s;e at the bottom of a Meadow, by
a River's Side, when he &s;aw a fine <HI>Carp,</HI> which
coming too near the Shoar, and by leaping at
&s;ome Flies, had flung her&s;elf on the Bank, and
there lay expiring.</P>
<P><HI>Avenant</HI> took Pity of the dying Fi&s;h, and
willing to pre&s;erve it, gently took it up, and
laid it in the River again.</P>
<P>The Fi&s;h immediately recov'ring it&s;elf, lifted
up its Head, and &s;aid, <HI>I thank you</HI> Avenant, <HI>my
Pre&s;erver, the time will come when I &s;hall make
you amends.</HI> And &s;o div'd to the bottom, to the
great &s;urprize of <HI>Avenant.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day, as he travel'd along, he &s;aw
a <HI>Crow</HI> ready to be devour'd by a rav'n$us <HI>Ea|gle.</HI>
Pity &s;iez'd his Brea&s;t; and letting fly an
Arrow from a Bow he had by him, &s;hot the
<HI>Eagle</HI> thro' the Heart, and deliver'd the poo$
<HI>Crow.</HI></P>
<P>The Bird no &s;ooner &s;aw her&s;elf freed; but

<P>The witty and grateful An&s;wer of the <HI>Car$</HI>
and <HI>Crow,</HI> took extreamly with <HI>Avenant,</HI> an$
made his Journey very plea&s;ant. Early the ne$
Morning he enter'd a dark Wood, where $word$
<PB N="97" REF="108">
heard an Owl bemoaning her&s;elf, that was
caught in a Fowler's Net; and looking about
him, he no &s;ooner &s;py'd her, but his Heart was
mov'd to relea&s;e her Nocturnal Lady&s;hip. Ac|cordingly
he cut the Net, and out &s;he flew.</P>
<P>The Owl expecting the Bird-catcher's coming
&s;aid, <HI>I mu&s;t be &s;hort,</HI> Avenant, <HI>you have not only

<P>Some time after <HI>Avenant</HI> arriv'd at the Palace
where the Beauty with Golden Locks liv'd:
And that he might make an Agreeable Appear|ance,
he put on a rich embroider'd Suit, a Plume
of white Feathers, and a fine Scarf about his
Neck. Thus equip'd, he took with him in a
Silk Net, a little pretty Dock, he had bought
by the way, and appear'd with &s;uch an Air of
Stateline&s;s, that the Prince&s;s's Noblemen &s;trove
who &s;hould introduce him fir&s;t,</P>
<P>By this time the <HI>Golden Beauty</HI> was inform'd
of the Emba&s;&s;ador's Arrival; and being told,
his N$me was <HI>Avenant,</HI> i$ run in her Mind,
That it &s;ignify'd &s;ome good Luck to her; and

<P>Her Commands were no &s;ooner obey'd, but

not able to expre&s;s him&s;elf: But commanding
a Pre&s;ence of Mind, equal to the Greatne&s;s of
his Soul, he made a mo&s;t eloquent Oration;
in which he reque&s;ted a better Fortune from
the Prince&s;s, than to return without her to the
King his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>I approve of all you &s;ay, mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd

&s;ince, as my Maids and I was walking by a
River's &s;ide, in pulling of my Glove, there fell
from my Finger a Ring, which I valu'd above
the World; whereupon I made a Vow, never
to li&s;ten to the Offers of any Prince, 'till it was
re&s;tor'd me again by the Emba&s;&s;ador who &s;hould

<P><HI>Avenant</HI> was much perplex'd at this An|&s;wer;

<HI>Caper,</HI> with his fine Scarf: But &s;he refus'd his

<P>The Emba&s;&s;ader retir'd to his Appartment, in

<P>WHEN the Empire of the Fairies was

<HI>Truffio,</HI> their reign'd a King and
Queen who had Two Sons and one Daughter;
Children of all the promi&s;ing A&s;pects that
could be expected. The Daughter was every
way lovely, and had as &s;he grew up, &s;tole a|way
the Heart and Soul of her Mother; in&s;o|much,
that a Concern for her future Welfare,
$ut her upon enquiring of &s;ome eminent Fai|$ies,
what Fortune would attend the remainder

<P>They all agreed in one Judgment, and told

and then arrive to a la&s;ting Happi|ne&s;s;
but that her two Brothers &s;hould be con|demn'd
to Death upon her Account.</P>
<P>This Curio&s;ity in the Queen, drew a deep
Melancholly upon her, which put the King
upon a &s;erious Enquiry into the Cau&s;e of her

his Male I&s;&s;ue. The Queen with Tears
in her Eyes, exhorted him to &s;ave them all,
particularly the young prince&s;s. At length it
was concluded to con&s;ult an old Hermit not

<P>Accordingly, the Queen went to his Cell,

bid her tell the King, That the only Expedi|ent
to &s;ave his Sons, would be to confine his
Daughter to perpetual Impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>Well, the Advice was put in Execution, and

$rimaces and Ge&s;tures at the &s;ight of her.</P>
<P>The King at fir&s;t thought this Behaviour of
$eirs, was occa&s;ion'd by &s;ome on$landi&s;h Bea&s;t

$f the Picture that was carry'd before him in
$riumph, he &s;oon perceiv'd his Error.</P>
<P>Tis not ea&s;y to imagin the Con&s;ternation his

<HI>$id he</HI> thus impos'd upon me! Well, they &s;hall
$ye for't; and let the&s;e &s;uffer al&s;o. With that

$ought to Execution.</P>
<P>The King, and the Prince his Brother, &s;eeing
$em&s;elves in danger, remon&s;trated to the King,
$hat what they had affirmed was true: That
$s threatning to put them to Death, was a
$ece of Indi&s;cretion? and that the Elde&s;t of
$em was a King rich and powerful as him&s;elf,
$ho&s;e Subjects, no doubt, who always lov'd
$n, would &s;oon make him repent his Ra&s;h|$s.</P>
<P>The King hearing this, began to be afraid?
$d was once in the mind to &s;et them at Li|$ry:
but a Rogue of a Court-Flatterer; a
$ini&s;ter of State, per&s;uaded his Maje&s;ty, That
<PB N="114" REF="125">
he would become the Banter of all de&s;poti$
Princes, if he did not, Right or Wrong, ex$|cute
them according to his Word,</P>
<P>Immediately Gibbets were erected; and the$
was but an Ace between their Living and D$|ing,
when the elde&s;t Prince, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tan$
of a moderate <HI>Mu&s;ti</HI> then pre&s;ent, prevail'd w$
the King to re&s;pite Judgment for &s;even Da$
a&s;&s;uring his Maje&s;ty, That in that time, $word$
&s;hould be able to convince him of &s;ome M$|&s;take
in the matter.</P>
<P>Things thus carried on at Court, the d,&s;tr$
&s;ed Prince&s;s <HI>Ro&s;etta,</HI> who had lain Eight $word$
Forty Hours floating betwixt Hope and D$|&s;pair,
was almo&s;t &s;tarv'd with Hunger an$

her Mu&s;cles&punc; Cockles, Shrimps, and Oy&s;ters, $word$
which Nece&s;&s;ity made her feed heartily. A$

Better had I never &s;een a Peacoc$
Surely the King of the Peacocks has reven$
him&s;elf on me, for being &s;o weak as to di&s;co$

<P>Thus &s;he exclaim'd agan&s;t the &s;everity $word$
her Fate, 'till Time and Tide were &s;o mercif$

old Fi&s;herman's Cottage, where he liv'd a $word$

$ump'd in, and drew her out.</P>
<P>He &s;oon carry'd her Home, accompanied by
$er little dog; and with &s;ome hol&s;ome, tho'
$omely Cloaths of his Daughter, put her in the
Dre&s;s of a Shepherde&s;s. After he had warm'd
$er by the Fire, and made her Eat what his
Cottage aff$rded, he ask'd the Cau&s;e of her
Misfortunes, which upon his promi&s;ing Secre|$y,
&s;he told him from the beginning to the
$nd. The old Man having heard all with a
$reat deal&punc; of Attention, was for informing the
King of the <HI>Peacocks,</HI> and fetch her &s;ome Dain|$es
from his Table; but &s;he forbid it and &s;aid;
My little Dog <HI>Fretillon,</HI> will be more &s;ervicea|$le
to us, if you will but hang a little Basket
$out his Neck.</P>
<P>The Fi&s;herman did as &s;he &s;aid, and the Prin|$e&s;s
cry'd, Get thee gone, and fetch me &s;ome|$ing
out of the be&s;t Pot in the King's Kitchi$.

took away a Dozen of Quails, and brought
$em to his Mi&s;tre&s;s. She &s;ent him again, and
$en he return'd loaden with Citron-Water,
Naples-Bisket, and pre&s;erv'd Fruits.</P>
<P>When his <HI>Peacock</HI> Maje&s;ty was to Dine, the
$ervants were at a lo&s;s for the Provi&s;ion: So
$at in a fright, they told the King, his Dinner
was taken from them they knew not how.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;aid he frowning&punc;</HI> &s;ee that I have my
upper, or el&s;e Death &s;hall be your Portion.</P>
<P>Accordingly they made Provi&s;ion for it, but
$e One-Ear'd Doy had carried it all to his
$i&s;tre&s;s. So that the King having fa&s;ted &s;ince
<PB N="116" REF="127">

and was forc'd to go to Bed Supper|le&s;s.</P>
<P>Well, he was &s;erved &s;o three Days together

how the Victuals was carried off, an$
who having follow'd the Dog, unob&s;erv'd $word$

<P>Immediately Me&s;&s;engers were &s;ent thither

<P>They pre&s;ently carry'd them, with the D$

<P>Ble&s;s me! At this News the Hungry Ki$

her more than his Life.</P>
<P>In the mean time, her Brothers, the Nu$

<P>UPON the Death of Queen <HI>Gentilla,</HI> an
illnatur'd Prince a&s;cended the Throne,
who&s;e i$placable Di&s;po&s;ition had pro|cur'd
him to be nicknam'd the <HI>Brown Ring.</HI>
He had a Son nam'd <HI>Tortieuli,</HI> mon&s;tro$&s;ly de|form'd
in Body, but po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a Soul eve|ry
way agreeable and plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>The King his Father had pitch'd upon the
Daughter of a neighbouring Prince to be his
Wife, nam'd <HI>Trogniana;</HI> a mere Dwarf, and
one that had a Face very ugly and frightful, bat
was endow'd with many rare and bright Accom|pli&s;hments,
with abundance of Wit and Good
Humour.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brown King</HI> having got her Picture pre|&s;ented
it his Son, and commanded him to ad|mire
it, and prepare to marry the Original.
The Prince took it, and looking upon it with
Contempt, mode&s;tly told his Father, That he
was re&s;olv'd never to marry &s;uch a prepo&s;t'rous
Creature. The King grew Angry at his Ob|&s;tinacy,
and to correct his Di&s;obedience, threw
him into a Ca&s;tle, wherein no Pri&s;oner had been
many Years before.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="133">
Then the <HI>Brown King</HI> &s;ent an Emba&s;&s;ador
with his Son's Picture to <HI>Trogniana</HI>'s Father,
to demand her in Marriage; which the King
no &s;ooner &s;aw, but imbracing the Offer, carry'd
it his Daughter, and told $er, That it was his
Will that &s;he &s;hould place her Affection upon
the Prince that Picture repre&s;ented; for that
he was to be her Husband.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Prince&s;s &s;aw it, &s;he began to
look pale, and her Heart &s;welling with Grief,
&s;he could not forbear &s;hedding &s;ome Tears.</P>
<P>Her Father took the Re&s;entment immedi|ately;
and ordering a Looking-Gla&s;s to be
brought, There, &s;aid he, &s;ee your own Deform|ity,
and examine with your &s;elf, what rea&s;on
you have to be di&s;&s;atisfy'd&punc; <HI>Trogniana</HI> would
fain have excu&s;ed her&s;elf, and per&s;uaded her
Father to drop a Match &s;he had no Inclination
to: But the angry Parent &s;aid, it was his
Plea&s;ure it &s;hould be &s;o, and therefore command|ed
her to be ready to depart in a few Hours.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s was &s;o dutiful as to &s;uffer her|&s;elf
to begin the Journey in a Po&s;t-Chai&s;e; and
where we mu&s;t leave her, pur&s;uing her Journey
awhile, and return to the impri&s;on'd Prince.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Torticuli</HI> walking in a Gallery in the
Ca&s;tle, like others in Confinement, could not
$orbear thinking of his Misfortunes. He con|ceiv'd
it afflicting enough, to be &s;en&s;ible of his
own Deformity; much more, that he &s;hould
be oblig'd to captivate his Will to a Per&s;on$
ten times more de&s;picable than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of the&s;e Confu&s;ions, he threw
his Eyes about, and '&s;py'd a certain Parcel of
<PB N="121" REF="134">
Pictures, which for their Antiquity, had been
pre&s;erv'd there as great Rairities. The Beauty
and Vivacity of the&s;e Originals, made him in|&s;pect
them with more Curio&s;ity, when he di&s;|cover'd
a young Man among them, exactly
the Picture of him&s;elf, who was painted taking
a Gold Key out of a Stone-Wall.</P>
<P>In many places he &s;aw his Picture; as al&s;o
that of a mo&s;t beautiful Prince&s;s, who&s;e Looks
were &s;o agreeable to him, that he could not
forbear admiring of it. Indeed it was matter of
Wonder to him, to &s;ee &s;uch &s;urprizing Rari|ties;
and he could not imagine what <HI>Genius</HI>
&s;hould in&s;pire the Painter's Brea&s;t, to Picture
him above two Hundred Years before he came
into the World.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Speculations he retir'd to his
Chamber, and taking an old Manu&s;cript that
lay by him, opened it, and found the &s;ame Pi|ctures
in it he &s;aw before. Turning over &s;ome
of the Leaves&punc; immediately a Con&s;ort of Mu|&s;ick
was heard; Game&s;ters were &s;een playing
at all &s;orts of Games; Weddings, Dancing,
Singing, and what not? At la&s;t, turning over
a certain Leaf, he &s;aw really a Parcel of <HI>Pigmy
Gentry,</HI> Fea&s;ting them&s;elves merrily, when one
of them taking a Gla&s;s, turn'd to the Prince,
and drank his Health; and told him withal,
That he &s;hould be a happy Prince, if he re&s;tor'd
them their Queen, but mi&s;erable if not.</P>
<P>The Prince was &s;o frightned at the&s;e Appa|ritions,
that for &s;ome time he &s;wooned away,
and let drop his Book on the Floor. He was
no &s;ooner recover'd, but willing to review the
<PB N="122" REF="135">
Cau&s;e of his Indi&s;po&s;ition, he took up the
Book, and looking into it again, found nothing
at all in it. This was another &s;hocking &s;ur|prize
to him; but it pre&s;ently went off by
concluding, that what he had hitherto &s;een,
was nothing but Delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Early the next Day he went into the Galle|ry
again, where the Pictures appear'd to him,
as if they were all alive. Among the re&s;t, he
&s;aw his own Picture going up into the Tower:
And willing to &s;ee the i&s;&s;ue of &s;o nice a Won|der,
followed it; and by imitating its Actions,
in every thing, found in a Hole of the Wall,
a Gold Key, that had been hid there &s;ome A|ges.
The Prince took it up, and open'd a Cup|board
ju&s;t by, who&s;e out-&s;ide &s;eem'd very odd
and ugly, but within very beautiful and delicate.
The Drawers were all of Chry&s;tal. Amber, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and were full of the mo&s;t admirable Curio&s;ities.
At this charming &s;ight, the Prince was extream|ly
pleas'd, until open$ng a certain Drawer, a
<HI>Brilliant</HI> Box appear'd, in which was a Man's
Hand wel$ring in its Blood.</P>
<P>A Man had need of a great deal of Spirit, at
&s;o &s;trange a &s;ight; but the Prince being a Prince
of Re&s;olution, and recollecting what one of the
Pigmies had told him, he took Courage, and
&s;aid; Tell me, if po&s;&s;ible, O unhappy Hand,
what has render'd thee &s;o unfortunate? A$
the&s;e Words, the Hand began to move, and
by Signs &s;aid, Happy Prince, thou art able to
&s;et free one of the brighte&s;t Beauties on Earth&punc;
Repair to the Gallery, and where thou &s;ee&s;t th$
Sun &s;hine, be&s;ure to &s;earch; for there lyes all
<PB N="123" REF="136">
my Happine&s;s; and there you will find the end
of your Misfortunes.</P>
<P>The Prince putting the Hand in its place a|gain,
and the Key in the whole of the Wall,
went thither accordingly; and ob&s;erving where
the Sun &s;hone, he found the Picture of an ange|lick
Youth hanging again&s;t the Wall. His Cu|rio&s;ity
led him to turn it a&s;ide, under which
was a wain&s;cotted Ebony Wall, gilt with Gold,
and which rais'd it &s;elf on a &s;udden, and pre|&s;ented
the Prince with a Pro&s;pect of a &s;tately
Chamber of Porphyry. He entred it, and ad|vancing
&s;ome Steps, went through an infinite
Number of fine Appartments, to a little Cham|ber,
where he found &s;leeping on a rich Couch,
under a Canopy, one of the lovelie&s;t Beauties in
the World: Her Hair was as black as a Raven,
$hanging in Curls about her Brea&s;ts, which were
whiter than Snow.</P>
<P>The Prince ob&s;erving her langui&s;hing po&s;ture
found &s;he was now and then interrupted in her
Sleep, with deep Sighs, Startings, aud Expo&s;tu|lating
with her&s;elf.&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;He had not gaz'd long, but, Perfidious
(cry'd &s;he in her Sleep) Do&s;t thou think to &s;hare
my Affections, by robbing me of <HI>Tran&s;imenes?</HI>
Thou barbarous Cruel, who&s;e Villany &s;hall one
Day meet with a Puni&s;hment from that Hand,
thou ha&s;t &s;eparated from the Body of my love|ly
Prince.&mdash;[Here &s;he &s;tarted, her Fle&s;h
trembled, her Pul&s;e beat violently, and her Eyes
let fall &s;ome Tears; and then clinching eager|ly
her Hands, went on&punc;&mdash;Yes Wretch
Furies &s;hall prey upon thy treacherous Soul!
<PB N="124" REF="137">
Ah, <HI>Tra&s;imenes! Tra&s;imenes!</HI> unhappy, wretch|ed,
and mi&s;erable I, that am bani&s;h$d thy &s;ight!</P>
<P>The Prince heard and &s;aw all with the great|e&s;t
Surprize; and whil&s;t he was bu&s;ying his
Thoughts about his Lady, a Con&s;ort of Birds
made a mo&s;t agreeable Harmony, when in came
an Eagle, with a <HI>Golden Branch,</HI> full of Rubie$
and Diamonds. The kingly Bird, immediate|ly
flew round her, and gently fann'd her with
his Wings: Then he gave the <HI>Branch</HI> to Prince
<HI>Torticuli,</HI> at which all the Birds &s;criem'd out
&s;o loud, they made the Palace ring again.</P>
<P>This Accident &s;oon inclin'd the Prince to
believe the Lady was inchanted; and to try
the Experiment, bowing him&s;elf gently, he
touch'd her with the Branch, and conjur'd her
in the Name of <HI>Tra&s;imenes,</HI> to awake from her
Trance; when in a Minute, &s;he opened her
Eyes, and looked about. 'Spying the Eagle,
&s;he cry'd out, Stay, the Life of my Love, &s;tay!
But the Eagle taking no Notice, flew away
with the re&s;t of the Birds, leaving a mo&s;t la|mentable
Cry behind him.</P>
<P>Then the Lady addre&s;s'd <HI>Torticuli,</HI> and return|ing
him Thanks, for freeing her from a Le|thargy
which had captivated her Two Hundred
Years, told him, that &s;he was able, wil|ling,
and very ready to make him whatever he
pleas'd.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, after &s;ome Compliments between
them, the Prince, willing to be Strait like other
Men, ask'd that Favour of her, which &s;he rea|dily
granted.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="138">
The beautiful Lady bid him &s;tand &s;till, and
took the <HI>Gilded Branch,</HI> aud &s;trok'd him thrice
with it. Ri&s;e, Sir, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> one of the com|pleate&s;t,

<P>With the&s;e Words, both Lady, Palace, and
all therein vani&s;h'd in a Moment, when the
Prince found him&s;elf in a &s;pacious Wood, a
Hundred Leagues di&s;tant from the Tower he
was before confin'd in.</P>
<P>To return. When the Guards mi&s;s'd Prince
<HI>Torticuli,</HI> the dread of the King's Di&s;plea&s;ure,
put them upon giving out, that he was fallen
Sick; appointing one of their crooked Com|rades
to lye in his Bed, and per&s;onate him,
in ca&s;e the King &s;hould come to &s;ee him. This
Project had its Effect: For the King was no
&s;ooner told of it, but he made &s;light of the
matter, and &s;aid, He was not $orry his Son had
his De&s;erts.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Prince&s;s <HI>Trogniana</HI>
arrived: And when the King &s;aw her wide
Mouth, her &s;cropulous Skin, and Negro's No&s;e,
the King, by way of Banter, thanked her for
her Civility in refu&s;ing to marry his Son, who
was not half &s;o deformed as her&s;elf.</P>
<P>No matter for that, my Liege, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> Your
Maje&s;ty may divert your&s;elf from the Thoughts
<PB N="126" REF="139">
of a Match with your Son, for I am not &s;o $word$

<P>At this the King grew Angry, and &s;aid, he
would &s;ee to that: And &s;o order'd her an Ap|partment;
and &s;ome Ladies were a&s;&s;ign'd to
per&s;uade her to the Marriage.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t Matters were thus tran&s;acting at
Court, the Kings Guards &s;ent his Maje&s;ty No|tice
that the Prince his Son was dead, having
put &s;ome heavy Lun$ber in a Coffin to di&s;gui&s;e$
the matter. The credulous King Wept at the
News; and without repairing to the Ca&s;tle
gave Orders for his private Interment.</P>
<P>His Fancy had form'd a Notion, that <HI>Trog|niana</HI>
had &s;ome Hand in his Death; &s;o that to
&s;atisfy his Revenge, and puni&s;h her Di&s;obedi|ence,
he made bold to confine her in the &s;ame
Tower for her Life.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s, in this Affliction was thought|ful
of her Father, and accordingly wrote &s;eve|ral
Letters to him; but they were all intercept|ed,
and carry'd to the <HI>Brown Monarch.</HI> She in|deavour'd
to Divert her&s;elf; and would now
and then be admiring the Pictures in the Gal|lery.</P>
<P>One Day, as &s;he was at this Exerci&s;e, &s;h$
perceiv'd among them, the Picture of her ow$
ugly Self. It &s;urpriz'd her to be&s;ure, and &s;h$
made Reflections upon the Painter for it, an$
the more, when &s;he &s;aw by it, the Pictur$
of a beautiful Shepherd and Shepherde&s;s, wit$
whom &s;he was mightily taken.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="140">
In the mid&s;t of this Surprize, a deformed old
Witch appear'd, and told her, That &s;he was
&s;en&s;ibly touch'd with her Misfortunes, and was
come thither to Comfort her. Sigh not at that
beautiful Shepherde&s;s, (&s;aid &s;he) for I can make
you altogether as lovely. Chu&s;e therefore,
Virtue or Beauty, for Fate has decreed one of
them to be your Portion.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s being &s;en&s;ible that Beauty was
not la&s;ting, cho&s;e Vertue as the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tan|tial
Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The old Woman at this, pre&s;ented her with
her Muff, which was White and Yellow, and
told her, that if &s;he blew on the yellow &s;ide,
&s;he would become like the lovely Shepherde&s;s,
and that if &s;he blew on the white &s;ide, her Ver|tue
would become fix'd as Fate it &s;elf.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s accepted the Muff, and blowing
as &s;he had order'd on the white &s;ide, immediate|ly
found the Effects afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>Thus ble&s;t with one of the be&s;t Portions a
Woman can have, &s;he contented her&s;elf to wait
the arrival of her Father. And with expecta|tion
of &s;eeing him, &s;he would often get into the
Tower to look for his coming.</P>
<P>Going up one Day very eagerly, her Foot
&s;truck again&s;t &s;ome loo&s;e Stones in the Wall,
and forc'd out the Golden Key, which &s;he pre|&s;ently
&s;natcht up. Certainly, thought &s;he, this
Key mu&s;t be of &s;ome u&s;e hereabouts; and &s;py|ing
the Cupboard, &s;oon concluded it belong'd
to that.</P>
<P>With this thought &s;he look'd &s;ome time, but
could &s;ee no &s;ign of a Lock. At la&s;t &s;he found
<PB N="128" REF="141">
the Key-Hole, and opening it, was as much
charmed with what &s;he &s;aw, as the Prince be|fore
her.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, &s;he came to the Bloody Hand in the
Box, and was &s;o much concern'd at it, that &s;he
would have laid it a&s;ide, had not &s;omething
whi&s;per'd in her Far, and bid her take Cou|rage,
lay the Hand under her Pillow; and when
&s;he &s;aw an Eagle appear to give it him.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s having put every thing as &s;he
found them, took the Hand, and did as &s;he
was bid.</P>
<P>But three Nights was no &s;ooner gone, when
an Eagle came fluttering at her Window; and
then remembring what &s;he was told, &s;he opened
the Ca&s;ement, and let him in. The Bird was
extreamly pleas'd with his Admittance, when
&s;he pre&s;ently gave him the bloody Hand: and
in le&s;s than a Minute, there appear'd in the
room of the Eagle, a compl$a$ young Gentle|man,
with a Crown of Gold on his Head, and
his Robes flowered with Diamonds and pre|cious
Stones.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he no &s;ooner appear'd, but he ad|dre&s;s'd
the Prince&s;s, and told her, That a certain
Conjurer had kept him there 200 Years; be|cau&s;e
that the Fairy <HI>Benigna</HI> had rejected the
Magician, and be&s;towed her Heart upon him;
That out of Spite he had cut off his Hand
as he &s;tood admiring one Day, the Picture of
his Mi&s;tre&s;s: That by Virtue of his Magick, he
had turned him into an Eagle, and cau&s;ed the
Queen to be thrown into a perpetual Sleep:
That he was told, that a certain Prince and
<PB N="129" REF="142">
Prince&s;s, &s;hould re&s;tore them to their former
Happine&s;s, after the expiration of two Hundred
Years: and for that rea&s;on, the Fairy <HI>Benigna</HI>
took &s;uch Care to lock up his Hand where the
Prince&s;s found it.&mdash;</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, he look'd earne&s;tly on the
Prince&s;s, and cry'd, Speak, Madam, and ask
what you will, for it is in my power to effect
it.</P>
<P>The &s;urprized Prince&s;s knowing that Beau|ty
vani&s;heth like a Bla&s;t, kept to a &s;olid Prin|ciple,
and told him, that &s;ince it mu&s;t be &s;o,
&s;he de&s;ired nothing but that her Soul might be
as Beautiful as her Body was Ugly.</P>
<P>For a Reward of your Humility (<HI>&s;aid he</HI>)
be happy in both Soul and Body: And gent|ly
touching her, &s;he became one of the mo&s;t
lovely Shepherde&s;s's in the World. Now, <HI>&s;aid
he,</HI> I &s;ee you compleat, according to your De|&s;erts,
boar hence-forward the Name of <HI>Brilliant</HI>
for none has ever brighter Perfections than
your &s;elf; and you &s;hall at la&s;t be crown'd
with Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Words every thing vani&s;hed a|bout
her, and &s;he found her&s;elf in the &s;ame
Wood where Prince <HI>Torticuli</HI> was turn'd Shep|herd.</P>
<P>She no &s;ooner &s;aw her&s;elf in the lone&s;ome
place, with a Flock of Sheep, a Crook, and a
little Dog by her &s;ide, but &s;he was full of
Thought, and could not forbear admiring, that
&s;he who was a Prince&s;s before, was now become
a poor Shepherede&s;s, withour Friends or Rela|tions.
But tho' &s;he had &s;ome dejected Thoughts
<PB N="130" REF="143">
the &s;uddenne&s;s of he$ Charge, yet they la&s;ted
not; for all the Birds, Fl$$ks Woods, Groves,
and Flowers c$n&s;pir$$ to make her Life plea|&s;ant
and &s;weet.</P>
<P>In this State &s;he conten$ed her&s;elf to feed her
innocent Flock till the Shepherd Pri$ce wan|dering
one Summer's Day from his Fl$ck, found
the lovely She &s;leeping under a &s;hady Tree by a
River's &s;ide.</P>
<P>The Prince no &s;ooner &s;aw a Beauty &s;o &s;urpri|zing,
but gently made his Approaches to her;
and viewing all the Charms of Love in one Bo|dy,
remain'd fix'd like a Statue till the Prince&s;s
awoke.</P>
<P>Ah! incomparable Shepherde&s;s (<HI>cry'd he</HI>) is it
po&s;&s;ible you &s;hould fly Mankind for the &s;ake of this
&s;olitary place? Forbid it Heavens! Behold a
faithful Shepherd for ever devoted to your Ser|vice.
Let me therefore be first in the List of your
Admirers, and render my A&s;&s;iduities acceptable to
&s;o powerful a Beauty.</P>
<P>I thank you Shepherd, &s;aid &s;he, if any can
claim my E&s;teem, 'tis your&s;elf. But I had ra|ther
live this Life with my Sheep and Dog,
than be di&s;turb'd with the Hurry and Noi&s;e of
publick Bu&s;ine&s;s: To convince me, therefore,
of your E&s;teem, conduct me to &s;ome little Cot|tage,
where I may be friendly entertain'd.</P>
<P>Yes, lovely Fair, &s;aid he, and &s;o led her to a
little Hou&s;e, where liv'd a lame, old Woman,
who receiv'd her with as much Tenderne&s;s as if
&s;he had been her own Daughter.</P>
<P>After the old Grannam had made her &s;it
down, Pray Sweetheart, (&s;aid &s;he) What's your
<PB N="131" REF="144">
Name? <HI>Brilliant,</HI> quoth the Prince&s;s, making
her a low Courte&s;y, with which the ancient H$|&s;te&s;s
was &s;o well &s;atisfied, that $word$ $clently &s;et
before her Bread, Butter, $span$ Eggs,
and all &s;orts of Fruit, and $span$ $eartily.
The Prince at the &s;ame time b$g'd to &s;it down
by her, which &s;he con$ented to; and from that
time was &s;o &s;mitten with him, th$$ he $as
the remainder of her Thoughts. When they
had done, the Shepherde&s;s aro&s;e, thank'd her
aged Ho&s;te&s;s for the Civilities &s;he had receiv'd,
and taking her Cro$k, made the Prince under|&s;tand,
that his Conver&s;ation was no farther ne|ce&s;&s;ary
at that time; and &s;o went alone to her
Flock.</P>
<P>But it was not long before Love found out
Ways and Means to bring them together. The
Shepherd would often drive his Sheep among
hers, and whil&s;t they were feeding, entertain
her with amorous Songs, and plea&s;ant $un$s
upon his oaten Reed. And yet, &s;trange My|&s;tery!
tho' Love had po&s;&s;e&s;t both their Hearts,
that they could have dy'd for each other, yet
they could not forbear reflecting inwardly upon
their own Weakne&s;s, in &s;etting their Affecti|ons
upon what they thought below their Birth.</P>
<P>Thus Love continu'd in Ma&s;querade &s;ome
time till the Shepherde&s;s fled the Shepherd one
Day, and left him di&s;con&s;olate. Among&s;t the
many Inventions Love could find, to retrieve
&s;o great a Lo&s;s, the Prince made choice of this.
He took a tender Lamb, and ty'd Flowers and
Ribbonds about its innocent Neck; and dre&s;|&s;ing
him&s;elf in a taffery Wa&s;tcoat, very richly
<PB N="132" REF="145">
lac'd down the Seams, he went and found out
the Shepherde&s;s as &s;he was &s;itting very thought|ful
by a River's &s;ide:</P>
<P><HI>Pre&s;enting her the innocent Lamb:</HI> Ah!
(<HI>cry'd he</HI>) what have I done, thus to bani&s;h you
into Solitude? What Fault have I committed,
that you, lovely Shepherde&s;s; &s;hould fly me? Was
it becau&s;e your Flock and mine had the Care of
one Shepherd? Is it becau&s;e I would free you from
all the Misfortunes that may befall you? Is it be|cau&s;e
I burn, con&s;ume, and expire for the Love of
you? O hard Fate! wor&s;e than what hither to has
befallen me, that &s;he whom I adore, &s;hould puni&s;h
my Pre&s;ence by her Ab&s;ence; and let another ren|der
all my pa&s;&s;ionate Re&s;pects and A&s;&s;iduities fruit|le&s;s!</P>
<P><HI>Brilliant,</HI> having heard this, reply'd, and told
him, That he had no re$&s;on to fear her flying
him, &s;ince it was &s;o far out of Hatred to his
Per&s;on, that &s;he &s;uffer'd Violence in doing it.
That it was the Effect of Love and Duty, be|twixt
which &s;he &s;truggled, that made her &s;o &s;hy
of him, not but that &s;he could for ever &s;it by
the River's &s;ide, and contentedly &s;ee his love|ly
Shade in the Water. She conjur'd him,
therefore, by all the Re&s;pect he b$re her, to
leave her to her&s;elf; for that he having already
her Heart in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;he did not know, what
Treacherous Act it might be guilty of, by &s;ur|rendring
up what &s;he had with a Vow devo|tev
to Heaven.</P>
<P>Having thus inform'd him, &s;he gave a &s;udden
Start, and flew from the place where &s;he &s;ate,
<PB N="133" REF="146">
with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s. The dej$cted Lover
perceiving her flight, would have overtaken
her; hut, alas! his Grief was too weighty, and
his Sorrow too prevailing; he fell down by the
pre&s;&s;ure of his Torments, and lay in a langui&s;h|ing
Condition.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s had looked back, and &s;een his
Sufferings; yet for all the Pity &s;he had for him,
could not prevail with her&s;elf to return to his
A&s;&s;i&s;tance. She thought if &s;he did, he would
di&s;cover too &s;oon the Conque&s;t he had made
over her. So that with much ado, &s;he aban|doned
one more dearer to her than her Life:</P>
<P>When &s;he was out of Sight, &s;he exclaim'd a|gain&s;t
her beauteous Severity, and wi&s;h'd her|&s;elf
deformed as before. Amid&s;t a Thou&s;and
Thoughts revolving in her Mind, at la&s;t Vir|$ue
led her away in Triumph, with a Re&s;olution
$o fly him for ever.</P>
<P>She had been told of an eminent Magician
$hat lived in a Ca&s;tle not far off: And that &s;he
$ight wholly abandon the Thoughts and Idea
$f her Shepherd, &s;he was re&s;olved to apply her|$$lf
to this Enchanter, and ask his Advice.</P>
<P>With this Re&s;olution &s;he put Wings to her
$ace, till &s;he came through one of his Forre&s;ts,
$here &s;he fancied &s;he heard &s;everal Songs, tri|$mphing
over her Weakne&s;s and Favours, which
$ould often put her in mind of turning back
$word$ reproach him. But adhering to her fir&s;t
$rinciple, at la&s;t to the Conjurer's Ca&s;tle &s;he
$me; having run through many Briars and
$horns, and &s;uffer'd both Hunger and Tir&s;t in
$r Journey.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="147">
Having entred the Ca&s;tle, the fir&s;t Room &s;he
went into, was dark as Night, there being no
Light but what appear'd thro' a Crevice In|&s;tead
of Wain&s;coat, it was lin'd with the Wings
of Bats and Owls. Twelve Cats hung by their
Tails in the Cieling, grouling and &s;cratching
one another mo&s;t fearfully. Underneath was a
long Table, on which as many Mice were tyed
at a certain di&s;tance out of their reach, from a
great quantity of Chee&s;e and Bacon: &s;o that
all their time was &s;pent in vai$; for tho they
reacht and &s;trove never &s;o much, to &s;atisfy their
fami&s;ht Bellies with what they mo&s;t admired,
yet were they never the nearer.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the Prince&s;s was gazing at this Ad|venture,
in came the Conjurer in a &s;oo$y Gar|ment,
with a fearful Crocodile on his Head for
a Cap. A Whip, with ten thou&s;and knotted
Snakes at the end on it, was in one Hand, and
his Spectacles in t'other. Fear pre&s;ently &s;eiz'd
the Prince&s;s, who was &s;o terrified at his Looks,
that &s;he would have given ten thou&s;and Worlds
to have gotten back again. She &s;trove, but in
vain; for the old Wizzard had hamper'd her
fa&s;t in a parcel of Nets, &s;o that &s;he fell down,
and thought &s;he felt a tho$&s;and Pins and Need|les
piercing her tender Fle&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>All this while the Conjurer made him&s;elf mer|ry
with her Misfortunes. At la&s;t he bellow'd
in her Ear, with a hideous Noi&s;e the&s;e Words&punc;</HI>
See&s;t thou not the&s;e Cats and Mice? <HI>&s;aid he&punc;</HI>
They were all Princes and Prince&s;&s;es. <HI>I</HI> could

rival'd me, I decoy'd hither at &s;everal times, &amp;

by turning them into Cats and Mice. A Di|ver&s;ion
mighty agreeable to me, becau&s;e that
they now are Hated by each other, as much as
they were Beloved before.</P>
<P>No matter for that, (<HI>&s;aid</HI> Brilliant, <HI>interrup|ting

&s;hall not be what you would, a <HI>Mou&s;e,</HI> but a Crea|ture
of a different Species. <HI>And touching her
with his wicked Wand,</HI> Be therefore a Gra&s;hop|per,
<HI>&s;aid he,</HI> to live in the Fields and Groves.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s immediately became that little
Animal, but retaining &s;till her Rea&s;on, &s;he ga|ther'd
up her lovely nimble Limbs, and hop$d
into the adjacent Woods, and thus bemoaned
her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Unfortunate Creature, cry'd &s;he, that would
not be Happy when it was in thy Power to
be &s;o! See the folly of Ingratitude! Alas!
what am I now? What was I before, when the
faithful Shepherd &s;ought my Love? A beau|tiful

Whil&s;t the Prince&s;s thus lamented her Condi|tion,
the Prince was as much afflicted for her

and tired with &s;eeking her, &s;ate him&s;elf under
a Tree, He took his Pen-knife, and in Lover's

<P>The Prince&s;s by this time being grown $p$$

<P>The Prince&s;s &s;hed Tears, to think that he
would pre&s;ently be torn to pieces, and the more
becau&s;e &s;he could not make him &s;en&s;ible of it.
At la&s;t &s;he took him by the Hand, and led him
to her Cell in the Rocks, and made him repo&s;e
him&s;elf on a Bed of &s;oft Ru&s;hes. She then took
her Hair-lace and gave it him, with Signs that
&s;he was going to fetch &s;ome Food, and that &s;he
would return again. The Prince had now time
to lament his Misfortune, but &s;till the Idea of
his charming Deliverer, gave him more Con|tent
than if he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Crown.</P>
<P>The Prince&s;s by this time, was &s;o heavy loa|$en
with Provi&s;ions, &s;he fainted at the Prince's
Feet. She had brought him roa&s;ted Squirrels,
Rabbets, all &s;orts of Fruit, a Stone Knife, a
$ovely Shell to drink out off, and another to
Wa&s;h in; all which the Prince receiv'd with
$o many Te&s;timonies of Affection, that their

for his Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>At Night &s;he left him to return to <HI>Ravagio</HI>'s
$en, the more to prevent Su&s;picion, but when
$he &s;aw the mon&s;trous young <HI>Ogriletto,</HI> to whom
$he was to be Married, her Heart was ready to
$reak. She could not Sleep all the Night, a$
$ou&s;and Thoughts di&s;turb'd her Re&s;t; &s;o that
$arly next Morning &s;he went to the Prince's Re|$dence,
and there with Tears in her Eyes, by
$l the Signs &s;he could make, would have him
<PB N="146" REF="159">
flee the place for &s;afety. He flung him&s;elf at he$
Feet, and wiped them w$$h his Hair, while &s;h$$
&s;he pre&s;ented him with her turquois Heart, as a$
Token of her E&s;teem. The Prince ki&s;s'd th$
Hand that gave it, and looking $pon it ear|ne&s;tly,
read the following Words.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The only Belozed, Daug$ter to the King of the
Fortunate I&s;land.</HEAD>
<P>The Surprize the Prince was in, whe$ he$ read
it, was inexpre&s;&s;ible. He knew &s;uch a Prince&s;s
was his Cou&s;in, and that &s;he had been drowned
many Years before. He lifted up his Eyes to
Heaven, concluding' the Sea had thrown up
&s;o rich a Jewel. Then with Tears in his Eyes
he ki&s;t it, and ty'd the Heart about her Wri$$
again, reque&s;ting by a certain Sign only a little
Lock of her Hair in the room on't, which &s;h$
with &s;ome difficulty granted.</P>
<P>Thus four Days run away, when the Prince&s;s
coming to <HI>Raxagio</HI>'s&punc; Cave one Evening, &s;he
found a Supper provided for her with all the
Ra$ities that could be got. She wonder'd a$
the Meaning; but <HI>Ravagio</HI> told her &s;he mu&s;t
be marry'd that Night to his Son <HI>Ogriletto,</HI> and
for that rea&s;on he had order'd &s;o &s;plendid an$
Entertainment: The Prince&s;s immediately
trembled, and de&s;ir'd that it might be defer'd
a little longer? How! &s;aid the Mon&s;ter, I
have a Mind to devour thee pre&s;ently, at which
&s;he fainted away between <HI>Termen$$na</HI> and her
Son's Paws: <HI>Ogriletto,</HI> 'tis true, lov'd her en|tirely,
<PB N="147" REF="160">
&s;o with much ado, <HI>Rav$$$</HI> was per&s;ua|ded
to &s;ave her that Night.</P>
<P>The Prince, by this time, was wholly devo|ted
to her Command, and Love had made him
a perfect Slave in &s;o little a Space, &s;o that he
was ready to Dye, becau&s;e he could not tho|roughly
inform her of his Pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When &s;he returned next Morning, &s;he made
him to under&s;tand the Danger &s;he was in, of
being matry'd to another.</P>
<P>At which &s;he di&s;cover'd a vi&s;ible Alteration
in his Countenance, he was ready to dye at her
Feet; being altogether a Stranger to the Coun|try
where he was, and how to e&s;cape, he knew
not; which if he did, would be even Death to
him. The Prince&s;s was as much con$ern'd on
t'other $ide, and with an equal Grief, they &s;pent
the time in Sighs and Tears, 'till Night oblig'd
her retire from him.</P>
<P>In her way to the Cave, it being dark, &s;he
had the mortification to tread upon a &s;harp
Thorn, which run thro' the Sole of her Foot,
in&s;omuch that when &s;he came home, the Pains
were &s;o afflicting, in conjunction with her
Concern for the Prince, that &s;he &s;wooned away
&s;everal times.</P>
<P><HI>Ravagio, Tormentina,</HI> and <HI>Ogriletto,</HI> were all
troubled at the Misfortune, they pull'd out the
Thorn (b$t knew not of another in her Heart)
and laid &s;ome Herbs to the Wound, and put
her to Bed. But Sleep &s;he could not, nor could
&s;he go as u&s;ual in the Morning to the Prince:
So that the Apprehen&s;ions of his breaking his
Heart for her ab&s;ence, occa&s;ion'd a double Grief.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="161">
The Prince indeed was &s;o much concern'd at
her not returning, that in De&s;pairs he was re|&s;olved
to go in que&s;t of her, tho' he lo&s;t his
Life. By the help of a rude Track, he travel'd
'till he came to the <HI>Ogrichon</HI>'s Den, which he no
&s;ooner enter'd, but the Mon&s;ter <HI>Ravagio</HI> &s;nap'd
at him, and would have devour'd him, had not
the Prince&s;s fell down on her Knees, and in|treated
him to keep that fre&s;h Provi&s;ion till her
Wedding-Day: <HI>Ravagio</HI> con&s;ented to it, order|ing
her to feed and fatten him again&s;t the Day
appointed. But &s;he did it with another Inten|tion,
and it was with a de&s;ign to pre&s;erve him
from De&s;truction; which in a little time &s;he
thus effected.</P>
<P>The <HI>Oger, Ogre&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Ogricons</HI> always &s;leep
with Crowns of Gold upon their Heads; and
the Prince&s;s lying with them, &s;he thought with
her&s;elf, that Hunger was &s;trong enough to
break thro' Stone Walls, and that if <HI>Ravagio's</HI>
Appetite &s;hould provoke him in the Night,
&s;he did not know, but he might devour the
Prince, notwith&s;tanding his Word to the con|trary.
She therefore, when they were all a&s;leep,
took the Crown from the Head of the fir&s;t <HI>Ogri|chon</HI>
&s;he came to, and put it on the Prince's, and
return'd to her own Apartment.</P>
<P>This Project had its de&s;ired Effect. For <HI>Ra|vagio</HI>
longing to make a Meal of the Prince,
aro&s;e in the dark, and felt for one among the
<HI>Ogrichons,</HI> without a Crown upon his Head,
whom having found he immediately devour'd,
and return'd to his <HI>Ogre&s;s</HI> who lay fa&s;t a&s;leep.</P>
<P>The next Morning <HI>Tormentina</HI> mi&s;&s;ing one of
<PB N="149" REF="162">
$her Brats, &s;he went to the Cavern, and percei|ving
it Bloody, gave &s;uch a Howl, that all the
Woods rung with it. <HI>Ravagio</HI> pre&s;ently heard
her, and being &s;en&s;ible of his Mi&s;take, com|manded
her to be &s;ilent; for that he had eaten
the little Mon&s;ter in&s;tead of the Prince. <HI>Tor|mentina</HI>
was forc'd to &s;ubmit, for her Husband
was ab&s;olute, and one who could eat Wives
with as little Compa&s;&s;ion as as any thing.</P>
<P>The next Night the Prince&s;s did as before;
when <HI>Tormentina</HI> awaking, was re&s;olv'd to re|$enge
the death of her Ogrichon on the Prince.
She went to the place where the Ogrichons lay,
and finding one without a Crown among 'em,
immediately eat it up, believing it to be the
S$$nger, and returned to take her Sleep out.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Morning came, <HI>Tormentina</HI> went
to $$ok after her young <HI>Ogrichons,</HI> aud finding
tha$ &s;he had by Mi&s;take devour'd one of them,
&s;he$$&s;criem'd out &s;o loud, that <HI>Ravagio</HI> immedi|atey
came to her. They both gna&s;h'd their
Te$th, and &s;torm'd in a fearful manner, and
re$ding the Air with their Cries, they were for
de$ouring the Prince and Prince&s;s, who had
hi$ them&s;elves in a dark Corner from their
R$ge.</P>
<P>In this Extremity, the Prince&s;s bethought
$er&s;elf of <HI>Tormentina</HI>'s Ivory Wand, with which
$he had $ &s;een her perform many &s;trange things.
Thought &s;he, if &s;uch an ignorant Brute can
$ork Wonders with it, well may I; and &s;o &s;he
went where it was, and taking bold of it, wi&s;h$
$n the Name of the Fairy <HI>Trufio,</HI> to talk the
$anguage of her di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Lover.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="163">
This had its de&s;ir'd Succe&s;s; &s;o that &s;he im|mediately
went to the Prince, and whi&s;per'd i$
his Ear, That &s;he was more afflicted at his Mis|fortunes
than her own; and withal told him
how &s;he came to under&s;tand his Language by
virtue&punc; of an Ivory Wand. The over-joy'$
Prince, with many Thanks, &s;aid, That &s;h$
was as dear to him as his Soul, and that no|thing
but Death &s;hould &s;eparate his Affection
from her.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, they had the Satisfaction of a Con|ver&s;ation
with one another, which none bu$
true Lovers enjoy; and among&s;t all their Pr$|jects,
that of their E&s;cape was the mo&s;t co$&s;i|derable.
The Prince&s;s told him, That as &s;oon
as Night came, &s;he would get <HI>Ravagio</HI>'s left
Camel, upon which they would both mo$$,
and &s;teer their Cour&s;e where Providence &s;hould
direct. The Prince approv'd it, and the wi$$|for
Hour came, when the Prince&s;s put a B$n$
in a Cake, and taking the little Wand in $er
Hand, cry'd, Pretty Be$n, pretty Bean, O litle

whil&s;t th$u ar$ roa$$ing, to talk as I u&s;e to $o,

thru&s;t the Cake into the Embers.</P>
<P>Now, &s;aid &s;he to the Prince, taking the Wa$$
in her Hand; let's mount; which they did ac|cordingly,
and rode away full &s;peed.</P>
<P>The Ogr$&s;s <HI>Tormentina,</HI> whil&s;t they were ma|king
their E&s;cape, awak'd in the Night, and
mi&s;&s;ing the Prince&s;s, call'd out, Hu&s;&s;y, why

<P>Early in the Morning, the <HI>Ogre&s;s</HI> went to pu|ni&s;h
her for not coming at her Call; but alas!
She found both Prince and Prince&s;s fled; with
that &s;he &s;et up &s;uch a Howl, that <HI>Ravagio</HI> leap'd

his coming. But when &s;he &s;aw him return
without them, &s;he call'd him Fool, and laugh|ed
at his Story about the old Woman, and her
Spectacles. Go back again, Simpleton, (<HI>cry'd
&s;he</HI>) and devour them in an In&s;tant.</P>
<P>The old Fool of a Mon&s;ter liquoring his
Boots, immediately &s;tept away, till he came
within &s;ight of them once more; and at ano|ther
Step would have been up with 'em, had not
the Prince&s;s, by virtue of her Wand, turn'd
their Camel into a Box, her&s;elf into a Dwarf,
and the Prince into a beautiful Picture. The
Dwarf &s;eeing <HI>Ravagio,</HI> immediately blew his
Horn; at which the Mon&s;ter came to him, and
ask'd if he had &s;een a young Couple go by that
way. The Dwarf told him, that a beautiful
Lady came by Ye&s;terday, with a valiant Knight,
who had fought in Honour of her, who&s;e Pict|ure
hung before him; and that the Lady before
&s;he went, charg'd him, That if an ill-look'd
Giant, with but one Eye in his Forehead,
<PB N="153" REF="166">
&s;hould come and enquire about her, that he
&s;hould tell him to give over his Search, for that
&s;he was for ever out of his reach.</P>
<P>Say you &s;o, (&s;aid <HI>Ravagio</HI>) which Way did
they go? Over yo$ Plains, &s;aid the Dwarf&punc;
Away &s;talkt the Mon&s;ter, and was out of &s;ight
in an In&s;tant. The Prince&s;s pre&s;ently took her
Wand, and with two or three Touches, they
were all in their proper Shapes again.</P>
<P><HI>Ravagio</HI> had gone all over the Woods, For|re&s;ts,
Mountains, and Vallies, with incredible
&s;wiftne&s;s, but was forced to return like a
Fool as he &s;et out. He had indeed bundled up
a few half-hearted Lovers, that he met by the
Way, and de&s;ervedly carry'd them with him:
And 'twas well he did &s;o; for <HI>Tormentina</HI>'s
Fury was grown &s;o great, that if &s;he had not
had &s;omething to &s;top her Mouth, perhaps &s;he
might have devour'd him; for the gray Mare
was now become the better Hor&s;e: And &s;uch a
She-Fury, knowing her Husband's Weakne&s;s,
could ea&s;ily have made the place too hot to
hold him.</P>
<P>We$l, having devour'd all he brought with|out
&s;o much as, 'Thank ye, Gaffer. Give me,
Coxcomb, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> your Boots, and let me &s;ee
what I can do: I'll warrant thee, I'll &s;oon find
$em out, and make an Example of them.</P>
<P>With that <HI>Ravagio</HI> for peace &s;ake, let her put
$on his Boots, as &s;he had oft done his Breeches,
$nd away the hagged Ogre&s;s went without a
Shift or Petticoat to her Breech, and &s;tretcht the
Boo$s a League farther than u&s;ual. She took
with her a mon&s;trous Club, her Hair was pow-
<PB N="154" REF="167">
with Toads, and ty'd up with Snakes; &s;o that
&s;he was a Spectacle frightful enough to terrify
the mo&s;t obdurate Heart.</P>
<P>Alas! her Motion was &s;o &s;wift, that in a few
Hours, the Prince&s;s &s;aw her. Now was th$
grand Tryal of the&s;e Lovers: They invok'd th$
Powers above to protect a Couple who could
have dy'd for the &s;ake of each other. In th$
mid&s;t of this Extremity &s;ome good Fairy pu$
it into the Mind of the Prince&s;s, to make u$
of her Wand once more. Come, my deare&s;t
(<HI>&s;aid &s;he</HI>) to the Prince, take Courage, all &s;ha$$
do well; With that &s;he wav'd her Wand thri$
and cry'd, be a Box, O Camel, and thou, lov$|ly
Prince, an Orange Tree, and my &s;elf a Be$
to fly and hum about thee.</P>
<P>The Words were no &s;ooner utter'd, but wh$
&s;he &s;aid, came to pa&s;s. When <HI>Tormentina</HI> ca$
up, and being tired with Travelling, &s;ate he$
&s;elf down to re&s;t under the Orange-Tree; $word$
bu&s;y Bee perceiving it, was re&s;olv'd to $eize h$
and notwith&s;tanding the thickne&s;s of her Hi$
&s;tung her &s;o terribly, that the Bea&s;t was hea$
to Ro$r many Leagues off. Now and then $word$
would throw her Paws at the Bee, with a d$|&s;ign
to kill it, but it was too nimble for h$
and flevv avvay. Hovvever the Orange-T$
Prince vvas in great Pain for his beloved B$
all the time.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the Hag was &s;o nettled with the &s;ma$
$ro&s;e up, and in de&s;pair &s;oaming at the Mout$
&s;talk'd home again; when the Prince&s;s wou$
have re&s;tor'd her&s;elf to her Shape, but &s;ome P$$|&s;ons,
<PB N="155" REF="168">
who by accident had been that way, had
carry'd with 'em ignorantly her white Wand.</P>
<P>This was a lamentable Surprize to them both.
They alike lamented their Misfortunes. The
Prince cry'd, Wo is me, that I &s;hould be thus
confin'd in a Tree! My pretty Bee, what &s;hall
I do, if you fly me? Cannot you &s;tay to live
upon the Blo&s;&s;oms I produce? My Leaves &s;hall
be your Bed, and free you from the venomous
Spiders. Ah, cry'd &s;he, Why &s;u&s;pecte&s;t thou
thy Bee? No Dove &s;hall be more truer to her
Mate. I will Watch thee, and Pre&s;erve thee
from the rude Touches of an unkind Hand.
All the Lillies, Je&s;&s;amines, and Ro&s;es, and the
&s;weete&s;t Flowers of the Woods and Plains, I
will &s;light for thee, and as a Proof of it, here I
will dwell, &s;aid &s;he. With that &s;he &s;ettled up|on
one of the large&s;t Flowers, and ble&s;t her&s;elf
with &s;o &s;weet a Living, whil&s;t the Tree flou|ri&s;h'd,
and lookt gay and lively.</P>
<P>It &s;eems this Orange Tree &s;tood in a Wood
belonging to a certain Lady nam'd <HI>Linda,</HI> who
coming with her Maids that way, vvas &s;o &s;mit|ten
with its Delicacy, &s;he &s;tood a con&s;idera|ble
time admiring it. She could not imagin
how it came there; and willing to gather a
Flower, &s;he no &s;ooner touch'd it, but the B$e
flew upon her Hand, and &s;tung her &s;o that &s;he
was ready to $word$ away with the &s;mart. She
then caus'd it to be remov'd by $word$, and
planted it in a plea&s;ant Garden next her Cham|ber
Window, whither the Bee accompanied it.
They had not been there long, but the Orange
Tree ask'd his beloved Bee, Why he &s;tung the
<PB N="156" REF="169">
beautiful <HI>Linda:</HI> Becau&s;e &s;aid the Bee &s;martly,
your Sweetne&s;s is mine, and you cannot be&s;tow
it on another, without Inju&s;tice to me. Be|&s;ides,
whatever you have is mine, and I am
bound to defend my own. But, reply'd the
Prince, can you let them drop without Con|cern,
and not &s;uffer the lovely <HI>Linda</HI> to wear
them in her Bo&s;ome? Yes, (<HI>&s;aid &s;he</HI>) with a
&s;evere Look, I can; but I find, Ingrateful, that
you can prefer a Lady in all her Gayety, to a
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, faithful, loving Prince&s;s, in a Tygers
Skin. And with this &s;he wept exce&s;&s;ively, and
let f$ll her Tears upon many of the Flowers, at
which the Tree was &s;o &s;en&s;ibly touch'd, that
his Grief for afflicting her, had like to have
made him wither away. Ah, cry'd he, you
rai&s;e the&s;e Jealou&s;ies only to excu&s;e your leav|ing
me! What have I &s;aid or done, to incu$
your Di&s;plea&s;ure? And thus they controvert|ed
all Night, as true Lovers will, 'till the Ze|phyrs,
who ow'd them a Kindne&s;s, came and
reconciled them.</P>
<P>The next Morning, nothing would &s;atisfy
<HI>Linda,</HI> but a No&s;e-Gay of Flowers from the
Orange-Tree; &s;he often attempted to gather
them, but the Bee as often &s;tung her. At la&s;t,
by the Advice of her Maids, &s;he dre&s;t her&s;elf in
Armour, and with Trumpets &s;ounding, went
with her Sword drawn to the Tree, and with
one &s;troke cut off a Branch; at which a great
Groan was heard, and a va&s;t quantity of Blood
&s;een to fall on the Ground. The &s;urprize mu&s;t
needs be great to <HI>Linda,</HI> who attempted after|wards
to join it together again, but in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="170">
The poor Bee was &s;o frightned at this Sight,
that &s;he was ready to expo&s;e her own Life for
his; and fearing that he might Bleed to Death,
by in&s;tinct of Nature (having his leave) flew
in&s;tantly to <HI>Arabia,</HI> and brought back on her
nimble Wings and Feet, a precious Bal&s;am,
with which &s;he daily dre&s;s'd and cured his
Wound.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ionate <HI>Linda</HI> was &s;o terrify'd at this
Tran&s;action, that her Re&s;t went from her. She
could not be &s;atisfy'd, till the My&s;tery was un|folded;
and therefore &s;he &s;ent far and near for
the mo&s;t eminent Fairies in tho&s;e parts, promi|&s;ing
them, that if they would vouch&s;afe her a
Vi&s;it, to be&s;tow on them whatever they de&s;ir'd.
The generous Fairies never want Intreaties to
do good; &s;o that away po&s;ted great numbers of
them to <HI>Linda</HI>'s Ca&s;tle, where among&s;t the re&s;t,
appeared the good Queen <HI>Trufio,</HI> being the
chiefe&s;t in the fir&s;t Order of Fairies. She was
no &s;ooner con&s;ulted, but &s;he went to the Tree,
and by virtue of her Skill, turn'd it into one of
the mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Princes in the World. At
this Sight, the a&s;toni&s;h'd <HI>Linda</HI> forgot her for|mer
Aver&s;ion for the Sex, and entertain'd a
Pa&s;&s;ion for him.</P>
<P>But the Prince falling at <HI>Truffio</HI>'s Feet, re|turn'd
her a thou&s;and Thanks, and beg'd that
his Happine&s;s might be compleat, by having
his lovely Bee, which was his Life and Soul,
re&s;tor'd to him in her proper Shape. It &s;hall
be done &s;aid the generous Fairy, and giving
$he Word, the Prince&s;s appear'd with all her
<PB N="158" REF="171">
u&s;ual Charms and Lu&s;tre, in&s;omuch that every
Lady then pre&s;ent envy'd her Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>When <HI>Liuda</HI> &s;aw this, her Rea&s;on put a &s;top
to a Pa&s;&s;ion &s;he &s;o newly entertain'd. She for|got
it, and fell to embracing the Prince and
Prince&s;s, who at the Reque&s;t of <HI>Truffio,</HI> had in|form'd
her of all that had happen'd to them $word$
and particularly of the Wonders they had per|form'd,
by Virtue of the Name of <HI>Truffio$</HI>
and her Wand.</P>
<P>The Plea&s;ure the Fairy took to hear her&s;el$
&s;o re&s;pectfully &s;poke of, oblig'd her to do &s;ome|thing
extraordinary for them; and which
&s;hould for ever &s;et them above the Frowns o$
Fate.</P>
<P>She took her leave of <HI>Linda,</HI> gave her th$
Gift of Faryi&s;m, and with a thou&s;and Embra$|ces,
&s;eated the Prince and Prinde&s;s with he$
in a flying Chariot, and flew directly to th$
Fortunate I&s;land, where the King and Queen
the Prince&s;s's Father and Mother, were &s;ti$
living, and who receiv'd them both as Childre$
ri&s;en from the Grave: Never were there &s;uc$
Re'oycings before.</P>
<P>They were marry'd in great Pomp, and thei$
fir&s;t-born being a Son, was nam'd <HI>Con&s;tont Love$</HI>
to which a long Train of other proper Titl$
have &s;ince been added; So that i$ has hithert$
