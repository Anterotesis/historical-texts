Be|lieve, that <HI>French</HI> Fa&s;hions are as ill &s;uited to
<PB N="56" REF="52">
the Genius, as their Politics are pernicious to the Peace of your native Land.</P>

<Q><L>A Convert to the&s;e &s;acred Truths, you'll find</L>
<L>That Poi&s;on for your Puni&s;hment de&s;ign'd</L>
<L>Will prove a whole&s;ome Medicine to your Mind.</L></Q>
