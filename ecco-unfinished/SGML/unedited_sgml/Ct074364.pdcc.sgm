<P>_WHEN I returned from <HI>Guil|ford</HI>, in <HI>July</HI> la&s;t, I found a Di&s;charge from the <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Manager, left for me at an unu&s;ual Time of the Year, and in an uncommon Manner, under the Hand of one <HI>White</HI>, a Servant of the Manager's: I pitied the Man that &s;ent it&mdash;&s;o thought him and his Scribe equally unworthy of farther Notice.</P>

A little more than a Fortnight after my Licence was granted, with a few un&s;killed Irregulars, I opened the Theatre, and performed there ten Nights in about three Weeks; I &s;pared no Pains, but Night and Day attended the Bu&s;ine&s;s, or I had not been able to have proceeded &s;o far:&mdash;My Labours were encouraged, and I gratefully remember the Honour &s;everal Noble Per&s;onages did me, by frequently gracing the Theatre, with their Appearance, on that Occa&s;ion:&mdash; I was in Hopes to have &s;trengthned my Company by &s;ome additional Forces, as &s;everal new Performers (&s;ome not unpro|mi&s;ing) wi&s;hed to take their Trials under my Tuition; and was not without Hopes

of being favoured with &s;ome Pieces from &s;ome Gentlemen who had before given Specimens of their Ta&s;te and Humour.&mdash; But alas! when <HI>D.

<P>I cea&s;ed not to petition, and &s;olicit Leave to continue.&mdash;While the <HI>D.</HI> of <HI>G.</HI> con|tinued at <HI>New-Market</HI>, I employed a Morn|ing, in the following Attempt at a Tran&s;|lation, or Imitation, of the fir&s;t Ode of <HI>Horace</HI>;&mdash;'Twas &s;ent to the D&mdash;, and not unkindly received; &mdash; I then pub|li&s;hed it in &s;ome of the Papers.&mdash;Here it follows, with the prefixed Letter printed with it.</P>

<PB N="17" REF="19">
Theatrical Capacity, as Author, and Actor, has been judged one of the greate&s;t Ornaments of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage)&mdash; is it not hard, that His Son, after having &s;pent many Years, with Ap|probation, in the Service of the Public, &s;hould be ob&s;tructed in his hone&s;t Views, of getting his Bread &s;till in their Service? &mdash; and really, by whom ob&s;tructed? may one not reply, by the Son of a <HI>Frenchman</HI>, who not content with having ama&s;&s;ed a princely Fortune, is &s;till jea|lous a Shilling &s;hould be added to a poor Man's Pur&s;e, le&s;t his Coffers &s;hould not &s;ufficiently run over?</P>
<P>Alas! mi&s;taken Sir, you need not fear being gay in your Palace, tho' I were to &s;mile in my Cottage.&mdash;Can you really think it rea&s;onable, to have my Head taken from my &s;hort Shoul|ders, that you, my little great Man, may ap|pear the taller? &mdash;Methinks, you might be &s;atisfied with the Height you have ri&s;en to (without ob&s;tructing others) as it is well known you are, in a very few Years, in Point of For|tune, become the talle&s;t Man of your Genera|tion, by many Thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>It is a melancholy Reflection for poor <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Comedians, in a free Kingdom, to con&s;ider, they are the only Slaves of that Country; but, too true it is:&mdash;And to whom are they Slaves? His Maje&s;ty? No: His beneficent Heart wi&s;hes for none.&mdash;To whom then?&mdash;Why, to the Patentees of the Theatres (the Actor's Superiors only as Patentees, which they became by great good Luck;) for it is certain, &s;uch is their
<PB N="18" REF="20">
Power&mdash;that if Want of Judgment, if Pique, or Caprice prevail, they can render the Abilities of the be&s;t Performer very u&s;ele&s;s Qualifications; they can damn good Performers by their Arts, and pu&s;h indifferent Ones forward by their Par|tiality; 'till &s;uch Favourites, growing familiar to the Town (and none better being &s;uffered to oppo&s;e them) they pa&s;s for Actors of e&s;tabli&s;hed Merit, and the Epithets <HI>Celebrated, Eminent</HI>, and <HI>Excellent</HI>, are as wantonly tacked to their Names as in the Marriage Articles of News, when

<P>In how much a happier Situation are the <HI>French</HI> Players, tho' in a Country of hateful arbitrary Power? &mdash; Tho' Super&s;tition, and Prie&s;tcraft, deny them Chri&s;tian Burial, yet Hu|manity denies them not a comfortable Liveli|hood:&mdash;Nor is it in the arbitrary Power of the Directors of the Theatres, wantonly to di&s;|charge the meane&s;t of them, without Cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned; nay, Provi&s;ion is made for all Kinds of Performers, who, by Age, or other Acci|dents, become Invalids, after &s;pending their Time in a Theatrical Capacity:&mdash;Nor is that Provi&s;ion &s;uch a &s;canty Stipend, but that it enables them to live with Decency and Com|fort.&mdash;But you, Sir, may probably know more of this, as your Father, a Native of <HI>France</HI>, was capable of acquainting you more fully there|with.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21">Think, Sir, what might have been your Situation, with all your Merit (which, believe me, Sir, I am not either ignorant of, or wilfully blind to) but for the late Mr. <HI>Fletewood</HI>'s fatal Indi&s;cretions?&mdash;Fatal, unhappy Man, to him|&s;elf, his Family, and Friends.&mdash;But for the&s;e, which occa&s;ioned, at la&s;t, his mortgaged Patent to be &s;old for a Trifle,&mdash;and many other happy Incidents, that all, at once, occurred in your Favour, you might have been in my Situation, Sir; &mdash;or at be&s;t, receiving a Stipend Thou|&s;ands &s;hort of your pre&s;ent Income: Since you may remember, a Cartel (of a cruel Nature) was propo&s;ed, and near &s;igning, by the then Managers of the Theatres, &mdash;when he who became the Patentee of <HI>D.

the Imputation of Vanity: I remember not any Opportunity I ever &s;lipped, to encourage any Author; or any Hard&s;hip, or Injury, directly, or indirectly, I was ever guilty of, towards any Performer:&mdash;On the contrary, I was ever for|ward to advance them, to the utmo&s;t that could be allowed, whenever their Merit &s;eemed to en|crea&s;e: &mdash;Nor did any Partiality to my&s;elf, make me u&s;e any &s;ini&s;ter Means to ob&s;truct the Ri&s;ing of another.</P>
<P>When you became a Manager, I was in an Article with your Partner; it was left to your Option to have me as an Actor, at a Salary inferior to what I had formerly received, from Mr. <HI>Fletewood</HI> &mdash; who found me of Con&s;e|quence enough to give me equal to any Actor then in being (Mr. <HI>Quin</HI> excepted, who&s;e Merits had earlier procured him a larger Salary than any Performer had received before). I then per|&s;uaded Mr. <HI>Fletewood</HI> (who con&s;ulted me on that Occa&s;ion) by all Means to add you to the Com|pany, as he then hinted he could have you:&mdash; And, tho' he had articled with me, to give no other Performer a &s;uperior Salary to mine, with|out mine being advanced equal thereto, I con|&s;ented he &s;hould agree with you, on any Terms he thought fit for his Purpo&s;e, and declared I would take no Advantage of &s;uch Agreement. &mdash;You may remember, Sir, our Meeting with you in order to &s;ettle &s;uch Agreement.

as a young Performer of ri&s;ing Merit) that any Part I had played was at your Service, only de|&s;iring Mr. <HI>Fletewood</HI> to allow me rea&s;onable Time to &s;tudy &s;ome others (which I &s;hould not be again&s;t acting in the &s;ame Plays) that I might not, thro' &s;uch Conde&s;cen&s;ion, be thought idle, or become u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>But, to return to my leaving it to your Option whether I &s;hould continue in your Company&mdash; You may remember my waiting on you, at your Lodgings, in <HI>Covent-Garden</HI>, to that Pur|po&s;e; &mdash; nor can you, I &s;uppo&s;e, forget the Letter your Partner received from me, on that Head:&mdash;You mu&s;t have &s;een it&mdash;it related to you both.&mdash;You be&s;t know, Sir, why you then declined my &s;erving you; &mdash; I too, Sir, know your Rea&s;ons now; &mdash; I gue&s;&s;ed them then;&mdash;and may, at a farther Opportu|nity, take more Notice of them.&mdash;In the Interim, let me remind you, Sir, I have not made U&s;e of that inconte&s;tible Power the Law has given me, to deprive you of a potent A&s;&s;i&s;tant, in your Theatrical Bu&s;ine&s;s; &mdash; Time has taught me to &s;tifle private Re&s;ent|ment, however ju&s;tifiable, where the Quiet, or Entertainment, of the Public is concerned:&mdash; I think it not con&s;i&s;tent with my Duty to them, to &s;top their Plea&s;ure in any one Place, e&s;pe|cially when I would wi&s;h to divert them my|&s;elf in another.</P>
<P>Perhaps your &s;uperior Policy may arraign mine. But, when I was a Manager, wh$
<PB N="22" REF="24">
have been Sir (uncomplained of) of His Ma|je&s;ty's Company of Comedians, and might have continued &s;o, had not a mi&s;taken Pur|cha&s;er bought my Farm over my Head, when I had no Su&s;picion of &s;uch Proceeding; &mdash; as a certain &s;et of Renters were lately &s;erved &mdash; a Ca&s;e not quite un&s;imilar. &mdash; When I was in the Management of the Theatre-Royal, I neither endeavoured to force any Entertain|ment on my Spectators, nor took any Methods to prevent their Diver&s;ion in any other Place,&mdash; though frequently urged thereto by my Brother Managers, who often con&s;ulted &s;ome partial Council, in order to &s;uppre&s;s other Theatres;&mdash; which Meetings afterwards occa&s;ioned that out|rageous Pro&s;ecution again&s;t Mr. <HI>Harper</HI>, the Comedian (who by the Way happened to be a Hou&s;ekeeper in <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI>, and a Freeholder in <HI>Surry</HI>) and in a mo&s;t unprecedented, and ar|bitrary Manner, did the &s;trained Power of a petulant <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> J&mdash;ce treat him. &mdash; Such was it deemed by a then L. Ch. J. (now an Ornament to the &s;till higher Station he fills) who relea&s;ed Mr. <HI>Harper</HI>, on his &s;ingle Recognizance to appear, if his Pro&s;ecutors thought it prudent to proceed further at Law: &mdash; This was after hearing many Council, learned in the Law, on both Sides, &mdash; and Mr. <HI>Harper</HI> left the Hall, with the unanimous Joy of &s;everal Hundreds, who crowded it on that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>'Twere ungrateful not to remember an honour|able Speech of the Great Man, who then &s;at on the Bench. &mdash; The Cau&s;e was appointed to be
<PB N="23" REF="25">
heard early in the Morning, when &s;ome of the oppo&s;ite Council were for deferring the Plead|ings, and treated it as a Matter of little Con&s;e|quence; that Great Good Man declared &mdash; He thought it a Matter of great Con&s;equence, as the Liberty of a Subject was concerned; &mdash; that he could not enter on it too &s;oon, &mdash; nor &s;hould he grudge any Time be&s;towed on it.</P>
<P>This known Fact was &s;ome Years before the Law &s;ince made, whereby acting is made ille|gal (though deemed by no Statute criminal or bad in it&s;elf) unle&s;s authori&s;ed by Patent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from the Crown, or Licence from the Lord Ch&mdash;n; &mdash;and, that the Legi&s;lature did not mean always to confine it to Two Theatres, in this &s;o great Metropolis, is evident from the unlimited Power (as to Number) which that very Law ve&s;ts in the Crown, and Noble Per&s;o|nage before mentioned. Many Years before this Law I was in the Profe&s;&s;ion of an Actor &mdash;encouraged by the Candour of the Town; happy in their Smiles: 'Tis not my Bu&s;ine&s;s here to remark on that Law; I leave that Ta&s;k to abler Heads, to whom &s;uch Province more properly belongs. &mdash; Nor &s;hall I dwell here on the many Theatrical Chicaneries which have been practi&s;ed again&s;t me, when I was mo&s;t un|happy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I declare, I do not mean, hereby, a general Reflexion, on my Theatrical Brethren; none will think it needs further Apology, but tho&s;e who feel the Smart of its Truth: Such are welcome to winch, and be mi&s;ty &mdash; and to &s;uch I &s;ay, &mdash;
<Q>&startq;In mine Adver&s;ity they rejoiced, and gathered them&s;elves to|gether: Yea the <HI>ABJECTS</HI> gathered them&s;elves together again&s;t &endq;me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and cea&s;ed not,</Q>
P&s;. 35. v. 15.</NOTE>; &mdash; I may have already tired the Reader
<PB N="24" REF="26">
too much.&mdash;But, as I before hinted (which let me here explain) that the little Theatre in the <HI>Hay-Market</HI> might become a Nur&s;ery for young Per|formers, from whence might be culled, at proper Sea&s;on, new Actors, for the Advantage of the Patentees, and the better Diver&s;ion of the Town, is undeniable. &mdash; Thus the Trial of &s;uch Per|formers at that Place, might &s;ave the Patentees both Expence, Time, and Trouble: The Mur|murs of &s;everal Authors might al&s;o be &s;topped hereby &mdash; &s;ince many Pieces might be here re|ceived, when the Managers of the Theatres Royal might but be able to bring many forward, few of the Multiplicity with which they are often overloaded;&mdash; and the Patentees might well &s;up|po&s;e, they would ever have the Preference both as to Performers, and Performances, &s;ince that Theatre, from its Smallne&s;s, and Situation, could never hope to vie with them, to their Preju|dice: &mdash; Their Apprehen&s;ions may be great, but their Danger could be but &s;mall.&mdash; Yet, whatever their Fears, is it rea&s;onable, a Mono|poly &s;hould be made of any one Profe&s;&s;ion, for the Emolument of two or three alone, &mdash; while all the re&s;t mu&s;t lie at their Mercy? Would not any Foreigner be a&s;toni&s;hed to hear that any Set of People, Proficients in any Art (in a free Country) are to work, or &s;tarve, at the Will, and Plea&s;ure of one, or two &mdash; nay, perhaps, as may be determined by &s;ome one who is to|tally incapable, either by In&s;truction, or Per|formance, of furthering, or improving, by Pre|cept, or Example, that Art which he gets an E&s;tate by? What a cruel Condition would the
<PB N="25" REF="27">
Profe&s;&s;ors of all the Si&s;ter-Arts be in, thus ty|rannically made a Monopoly of, to &s;upport the Profu&s;ion of a few Ignorants?</P>
<P>Once more, Sir, let me repeat&mdash;What would you think,&mdash;what would you feel,&mdash;thus hard be&s;et as I am?&mdash;Would you think it rea&s;on|able that no Portion of that Bread, the Town is able, and willing, to be&s;tow, &s;hould fall to your Lot? &mdash;That you &s;hould, to gratify the Ambition, or Avarice, of any rich &s;ucce&s;sful Man, when Nece&s;&s;ity urges in the latter Part of your Life, (though ble&s;s'd by Heaven with Health and Abilities) be prevented from ex|erting your Faculties in your own Behalf?&mdash; Would you be &s;ilent on &s;$ch an Occa&s;ion? Would you not let the Wo$ld know your Condition? Would you not acquaint &s;uch as may not have already con&s;ider'd it, that this Metropolis is amazingly encreas'd, that Proper|ty is greatly diffus'd; that many Families are ad|vanc'd;&mdash;that all Degrees of People go to Plays, as the mo&s;t rational Amu&s;ement;&mdash;that there are near thirty times the Number of Spectators there were 30 Years ago;&mdash;that &s;ix Theatres have flouri&s;hed in one Sea&s;on, when there were much fewer Numbers to &s;upport them;&mdash;and that the Town now have but two to go to?</P>
<P>For my own Part, I have but &s;imple <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hone&s;ty to proceed upon;&mdash; whether that will be of as much Service to me as <HI>French</HI> Je&s;uitical Policy, Time mu&s;t determine.&mdash;My remaining Hope is in a K&mdash;g, who&s;e Benevolence of Heart, were he but a private Man, would make him
<PB N="26" REF="28">
one of the fir&s;t of Characters; and who&s;e Ver|tues as a Prince, it will better become me &s;ilent|ly to admire, (while a happy Nation proclaims his Prai&s;e) than pre&s;umingly to expatiate on. &mdash;If all other means fail (remember, Sir, you urge me to it) I have &s;till the Right of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subject, to addre&s;s that great Power, who is ju&s;tly &s;til'd the Father of his People, who is univer&s;ally regarded as the Fountain of Goodne&s;s, as well as Honour:&mdash;I will not therefore de&s;pair, of &s;till having Leave to gain Bread for my&s;elf, and a little <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Company, in that Theatre, wherein the <HI>French</HI> Comedians have been more than once licens'd.&mdash;</P>
<P>It may po&s;&s;ibly be remember'd I have &s;ome|times, from the whole Royal Family excited a Laughter of Approbation.&mdash;Why then may I not hope their conde&s;cending Goodne&s;s will con|&s;ider and relieve the anxious Heart of a loyal Subject, who has often had the Honour of making them &s;mile.&mdash;I am, Sir, with all due Deference to your Merit, your real Admirer; &mdash;and &s;hould have been glad, long &s;ince, in a Theatrical Capacity, on proper Terms, to have &s;ub&s;crib'd my&s;elf,</P>
