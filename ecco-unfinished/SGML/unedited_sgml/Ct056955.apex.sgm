<HEAD>REASONS For Im&mdash;the L&mdash;d H&mdash;T&mdash;r, And &s;ome others of the P&mdash;M&mdash;</HEAD>
<P>A Nation can never be reduced to a wor&s;e Circum&s;tance, than to be afraid to do her&s;elf Ju|&s;tice, either this is our pre|&s;ent Ca&s;e, or we may be &s;aid not well to under&s;tand our Ca&s;e; and in ei|ther of the two, it &s;eems to be very much our Concern, that we &s;hould come to a right Judgment of things.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant of the violent Spi|rit that reigns at this Time, in the re|&s;pective
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Parties among us; how ill they reli&s;h any kind of Truth, which cla&s;hes either with their true or &s;uppo&s;ed Inte|re&s;t; and that upon this Score, Authors mu&s;t expect no fair Quarter among the Parties, which&s;oever they happen to of|fend: But be that as it will, here I &s;hall endeavour to do Ju&s;tice to my Coun|try, and examine a little without Doors, as others have done within, The <HI>State of the Nation;</HI> as little as po&s;&s;ible giv|ing Offence to any Party.</P>
<P>The great Que&s;tion now in Debate among us is, <HI>The Pretender:</HI> This agi|tates the Minds of Men, as a Storm does the Sea, rolling them this Way or that Way, and da&s;hing them again&s;t one another like the Waves, as their Judgment or Parties guide them.</P>
<P>Some will have it, That we are the happie&s;t, &s;afe&s;t People in the World, perfectly &s;ecure from all Danger, either of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> or of any other Invader; that we have nothing to do but to &s;it down under our Vines and Figtrees; be ea&s;y, thankful, and happy; turn our Hands to Cultivation of Arts, Science, and all kinds of Improvement; Launch out into Trade; grow rich and pro&s;pe|rous;
<PB N="5" REF="4">
live in Peace with all the World, and with one another.</P>
<P><HI>If this were &s;o,</HI> it is great Pity but we were made &s;en&s;ible of it, and that we &s;hould not lo&s;e the Advantage of that happy Condition which Providence has brought us to, for want of know|ing it, and for want of &s;eeing before us far enough to prevent our being amu&s;ed with needle&s;s Fears and Appre|hen&s;ions.</P>
<P>But there are &s;ome al&s;o among us, who are quite of another Opinion; who tell us, We are betray'd, &s;old to a cer|tain, entailed Bondage, and that wor&s;t kind of Bondage in the World, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Popi&s;h Slavery: That the Government we are under, have given us up; that the M&mdash;are engaged with the Pre|tender; that we are in a &s;inking Con|dition; that if the Queen &s;hould die, nay, even whether that happen or no, the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, which is our great Dependence, is undermin'd, and Mea&s;ures taken to impo&s;e the Pretender upon us, in &s;pight of Laws, Acts of Parliaments, &s;olemn Oaths and Abjura|tions, and in Defiance of the general Inclination of the People, <HI>and &s;uch like.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
The&s;e Things are pu&s;h'd on by the re&s;pective Parties, with &s;o much A&s;&s;u|rance, in &s;uch po&s;itive Terms, and with &s;uch un&s;ea&s;onable Warmth, that I think it would be lo&s;t Labour to engage be|tween them. Perhaps I may in &s;ome Part of the Di&s;putes differ from both Sides, and at lea&s;t may think, that both Parties carry the Quarrel on too far, alledge too much, and go a Length I cannot follow them in. But that is not all:</P>
<P><HI>My Di&s;pute is not with them,</HI> I am endeavouring in the&s;e Sheets to clear the way to <HI>Engli&s;h, or as it is now, Briti&s;h</HI> Liberty, and to &s;hew our Peo|ple what Right they have, and by what Method to enquire into the Truth of all the&s;e things, bring Matters of Fact to light, and the Authors of every evil thing to Ju&s;tice, however great they may be, or whatever Protection they may take Shelter under.</P>
<P><HI>On the other Hand,</HI> How the &s;ame <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberty may be claimed, to clear and defend innocent Per&s;ons from Slander and unju&s;t Reproach, which the great Men now &s;o much complain
<PB N="7" REF="6">
of, and perhaps with too much Rea|&s;on on both &s;ides.</P>
<P><HI>In order to this,</HI> I &s;hall not &s;o much enquire, whether the Nation is in a &s;afe, or a tottering Condition; whether the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Hanover</HI> be &s;ufficiently &s;ecured, or is in Danger, under Her Maje&s;ty's Admini&s;tration, &amp;c. as I &s;hall enquire what is the proper Cour&s;e we are to take, as Subjects, as <HI>Britains,</HI> and as Prote&s;tants, which&s;oever of tho&s;e States appears upon Enquiry to be our Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE, <HI>for Example,</HI> That it &s;hould appear, upon Examination, that the Prote&s;tant <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion is re|ally un&s;afe, from the Management of evil Men, whether at home or abroad, in Power or out of Power, is not the Que&s;tion with me; for I point at no Per&s;ons, nor take no Notice of the Words, <HI>the Queen's Admini&s;tration,</HI> which I think are ill brought into the Debate; and of which I &s;hall &s;peak more largely, before I enter into the Arguments that follow.</P>
<P>But SUPPOSE, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> That the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion is in Danger, <HI>I hope it is not;</HI> nor am I giving my Judg|ment
<PB N="8" REF="7">
whether it is or no, <HI>in the lea&s;t;</HI> but for Argument &s;ake, I may SUP|POSE it without granting it.</P>
<P>The Right which the People of <HI>Great Britain</HI> have, or have not, to &s;earch into, pro&s;ecute, and puni&s;h the Per&s;ons, whoever they are, that &s;hall be found guilty of bringing us into this Danger, &s;eems to be the pre&s;ent Que&s;tion; and a Que&s;tion it is which, at this Time, wants more than ever to be cleared up, as it would be the be&s;t, and perhaps the only Step that we can take, to bring all our pre&s;ent Di&s;tractions to a &s;hort I&s;&s;ue; for all our Complaints and Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es would end in legal Pro&s;ecutions; if we had Ju&s;tice, we &s;hould have no room left for Whi&s;pers and Scandal; if Ju&s;tice was again&s;t us, then tho&s;e Men we &s;u&s;pect, would be cleared and delivered from our Su&s;pi|cions, and the Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es on both Sides would die and wear off.</P>
<P>We have certainly &s;ome better Me|thod to redre&s;s our Grievances, and de|liver the Nation from the Dangers which we &s;ee impending, than merely bewailing them to one another, and crying out again&s;t tho&s;e we think are
<PB N="9" REF="8">
the Cau&s;es of them; if we have not, we are the mo&s;t mi&s;erable Nation in the World! Wherefore then is it that we &s;tand &s;till! Either the&s;e Dangers are real, or they are imaginary; either the&s;e Men are guilty, or they are in|nocent; why &s;tand we thus gazing at one another?</P>
<P>If the&s;e Dangers are imaginary only, and the&s;e Men innocent, why do we not detect the People, whoever they are, who have thus amu&s;ed and di&s;tracted the Nation with needle&s;s Fears and un|&s;ub&s;i&s;ting vi&s;ionary Dangers, and bring them to Ju&s;tice, as common Di&s;turbers of the publick Peace? Why do we not re&s;ent the Slanders they have rai&s;ed upon Per&s;ons, and even upon the whole Nation, and do Ju&s;tice to tho&s;e who they have injured, who&s;e Characters, if innocent, demand Ju&s;tice from us, and ought to be vindicated by us? for Right and Ju&s;tice is due to all Men in|differently.</P>
<P>On the contrary, if the&s;e Dangers are real, and the Per&s;ons complained of are guilty, why do we not do the Na|tion
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Ju&s;tice, and bring them all to an|&s;wer for it to the Law? why &s;hould we &s;uppo&s;e they are skreened under any Defences? why is their Admini&s;tration called <HI>the Queen's Admini&s;tration?</HI> We know that the Queen does all things by her Mini&s;try, and they are accountable to the Laws for all Male-Admini&s;tration, even tho' it were by her Maje&s;ty's Command, and may lawfully be im|peached, if any thing can be fairly laid to their Charge: If there is no Que|&s;tion about their Guilt, what Que&s;ti|on can there be why they &s;hould not be brought to Puni&s;hment? If we do not endeavour to bring them to Ju&s;tice, why do we complain &s;o much of their Guilt? not impeaching them, gives the Name of Slander to all we &s;ay of them; for unle&s;s a Crime be proved, it is no Crime in the Eye of the Law, and eve|ry Man is a ju&s;t Man till he is legally convicted of being otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>This brings me to &s;peak of what &s;ome People make u&s;e of as an Ex|cu&s;e for their not offering to impeach openly the Men they &s;o openly accu&s;e, (and which I mentioned above) that
<PB N="11" REF="10">
is, that they are aw'd by the annexing the Words, <HI>the Queen's Admini&s;tration,</HI> to the Que&s;tion, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Whether the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion is in Danger <HI>under the Queen's Admini&s;tration?</HI> This they &s;ay is a Prejudice to the Debate, and a Skreen under which the People point|ed at are &s;heltred from the Pro&s;ecu|tions which would otherwi&s;e be brought again&s;t them; <HI>&s;uppo&s;ing,</HI> as I imagine, that &s;ome People being tender of the Reputation of the Queen, or of offer|ing any thing that may look unkind or undutiful to her Maje&s;ty, were there|fore backward to pa&s;s their Cen&s;ure in &s;uch a Que&s;tion, and &s;o worded; who, if the &s;ingle Que&s;tion had been propo|&s;ed to them, whether the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion was in Danger or no, would freely have given their Opinions.</P>
<P>It &s;eems not &s;o much to be the im|mediate Debate, whether the Danger be under the <HI>Queen</HI>'s <HI>Admini&s;tration,</HI> till the previous Que&s;tion be determined, whether there is a real Danger of the Succe&s;&s;ion or not; the which being once re&s;olved in the affirmative, it would have been a natural Con&s;equence to
<PB N="12" REF="11">
enquire <HI>whence,</HI> or <HI>by whom,</HI> from what Cau&s;es or Per&s;ons that Danger pro|ceeds.</P>
<P>If any are of Opinion, that adding the Words, <HI>the Queen's Admini&s;tration,</HI> was nece&s;&s;ary to influence tho&s;e who are to give their Judgment in the Point, they injure her Maje&s;ty's Reputation by that Opinion more than perhaps they are aware of; for, if the Succe&s;&s;ion be really in danger, albeit the adding the Words, <HI>the Queen</HI>'s <HI>Admini&s;tration,</HI> may be thought in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to cover that Danger from the Re&s;entment of the People, and &s;top the farther Enquiry into it, yet it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to CONCEAL the Danger from their Knowledge, or <HI>cure their Apprehen&s;ions;</HI> on the contrary, it &s;eems to encrea&s;e tho&s;e Apprehen&s;ions, by &s;ugge&s;ting to the People that there are real Dangers, and Dangers that are very threatning; but they cannot be enquired into, be|cau&s;e <HI>the Queen's Admini&s;tration</HI> cover them; and no Man can have &s;o little Duty and Re&s;pect to the Queen, as to &s;ugge&s;t that her Maje&s;ty's Admini&s;tra|tion is the Cau&s;e of tho&s;e Dangers.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
If this were the Ca&s;e, it appears to me as if it were a greater Satyr upon <HI>her Maje&s;ty's Admini&s;tration,</HI> that the Dangers of the Succe&s;&s;ion mu&s;t not be enquired into, becau&s;e of that Admi|ni&s;tration, than it would be, that the Admini&s;tration &s;hould be enquired into, becau&s;e of the Danger of the Succe&s;&s;i|on.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e People therefore very much fail in their Duty and Re&s;pect to the Queen their Sovereign, who &s;ugge&s;t or pretend, that a due Enquiry may not be made into our Dangers, becau&s;e we mu&s;t not examine into, or &s;u&s;pect or expo&s;e the <HI>Queen</HI>'s <HI>Admini&s;tration,</HI> and indeed it is the &s;evere&s;t Way of ex|amining into, and expo&s;ing the Queen's Admini&s;tration that can be: <HI>The Ad|mini&s;tration of the Queen,</HI> and of every Sovereign, is intended, by the Nature of the thing, for the Safety of the Go|vernment, and of the Nation &s;o go|verned; and I dare &s;ay, no Prince that ever &s;at on the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Throne, ever more &s;incerely de&s;igned to have their Govern|ment and Admini&s;tration directed for
<PB N="14" REF="13">
the Good and Safety of their People, then Her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty: To &s;ugge&s;t then, that there is a real Danger to the whole Nation, even no le&s;s a Danger than that of the future Settle|ment of the Crown in a Prote&s;tant Line, upon which depends the Safety, Honour, Liberty, Religion, and Pro&s;pe|rity of the Nation, both in our Time, and that of our Po&s;terity; and that we cannot enquire into the Circum|&s;tances of this Danger, becau&s;e we cannot in Duty to her Maje&s;ty que|&s;tion her Admini&s;tration. This is to charge directly all the Con&s;equences of that Danger, if not the Danger it &s;elf, directly upon <HI>her Maje&s;ty's Admi|ni&s;tration,</HI> which no good Subject can entertain a Thought of without &s;ome Horror.</P>
<P>Nor is this a le&s;s Injury to the Mi|ni&s;ters of State, tho&s;e great Per&s;ons to whom her Maje&s;ty has thought fit to entru&s;t the Admini&s;tration of her Af|fairs; for if this Addition of the Words, <HI>the Queen's Admini&s;tration,</HI> &s;hould be &s;ugge&s;ted to be made u&s;e of as a Skreen to cover them from the Impeachments
<PB N="15" REF="14">
which the People may think them liable to for the Male-Execution of their Office, or ill doing their Duty; This is a tacit pleading guilty in their Names without their Leave, and ac|knowledges in their behalf, that the Danger apprehended is real, and that altho' it may be &s;aid to be <HI>under her Maje&s;ty's Admini&s;tration,</HI> yet that it is really FROM their Admini&s;tration, and that they make u&s;e of the Shelter of the Queen's Per&s;on to skreen them from any legal Enquiry.</P>
<P>This I think, with great Submi&s;&s;ion to the common Opinion, is the great|e&s;t Injury that can be done to the Mi|ni&s;try, and is expo&s;ing them to the &s;evere&s;t Cen&s;ure; if you will fir&s;t prove that they fly to a Shelter to cover them from the Complaint of the Peo|ple, and the Enquiries which may, in a legal and regular manner, be made into their Admini&s;tration, any one will conclude tho&s;e Complaints are ju&s;t, that there is Cau&s;e for the Enquiry, and that their Guilt only obliges them to &s;eek a Protection, which no inno|cent Man would make u&s;e of, and
<PB N="16" REF="15">
which, I dare &s;ay, however any one el&s;e may de&s;ign for them, they have more Wi&s;dom than ever to think of for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations, and others of like Nature, move me to think, that we are all wrong in our Enquiry, and in talking of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion being in Danger <HI>under her Maje&s;ty's Ad|mini&s;tration.</HI> That the Prote&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;ion is in &s;ome Danger, I believe many fear, and no doubt but they think that they have very good Grounds for tho&s;e Fears: The natural Con&s;equence then of the&s;e things &s;eem to i&s;&s;ue here, <HI>(viz.)</HI> either that we &s;hould enquire fir&s;t upon the previous Que&s;tion, <HI>Whether the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;|&s;ion be really in Danger or no?</HI> or, that granting the previous Que&s;tion, <HI>That it is in Danger,</HI> we &s;hould &s;teadily pur|&s;ue our &s;aid Enquiry into the &s;ub&s;equent Que&s;tion, <HI>(viz.) Whence that Danger proceeds,</HI> what are the Cau&s;es, who the Per&s;ons, what the Conduct, and who&s;e Admini&s;tration this Danger ari&s;es from, and then what is to be done with them?</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
If it appears that our Fears are ima|ginary, our Dangers either none at all, or &s;uch and &s;o remote, as that we have no Rea&s;on either to be unea&s;ie, or to make others &s;o; as wi&s;e Men hope we may, we &s;hall find a great deal of room to blame the Warmth with which the&s;e things have been pur&s;ued, and perhaps come in to believe, as &s;ome would have all along per&s;waded us, that there is le&s;s of Zeal for our Coun|try, than of private Views in the Mea|&s;ures &s;ome Men have taken to alarm us, and fill us with Apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>But, on the contrary, if it appears that the&s;e Dangers are pre&s;&s;ing; that <HI>Hannibal</HI> is at our Gates; that there is a powerful Party at home, who are ready to take Arms in favour of a Popi&s;h Impo&s;tor; that this Popi&s;h Im|po&s;tor is forming Alliances abroad, and is &s;ecretly &s;upported from the <HI>French</HI> Court; or otherwi&s;e, that he is rai&s;ing Forces under Hand; and that he is formidable either in him&s;elf, or in the Pro&s;pects which he has of being &s;tronger; and that we have Rea&s;on, ju&s;t
<PB N="18" REF="17">
Rea&s;on, great Rea&s;on to fear his Suc|ce&s;s, and to apprehend the Con&s;equences as fatal and dangerous to the Prote|&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Han|nover;</HI> if, I &s;ay, the&s;e things are &s;o, and that what many People have &s;ug|ge&s;ted &s;hould al&s;o appear to be true, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that the&s;e Dangers are not only remote, as after the Demi&s;e of the pre|&s;ent Queen, but even immediate and impending, <HI>then I think,</HI> and I believe no body will doubt but that a farther Enquiry is nece&s;&s;ary into the Cau&s;es and Per&s;ons, to which, and upon whom we may &s;ee ju&s;t Ground to charge tho&s;e Dangers, and this without one way or other concerning her Maje&s;ty's Admini&s;tration in the Que&s;tion; and tho' I am not &s;o flegmatick in the Que&s;tion of the real Danger of the Pretender as &s;ome are, and perhaps have different Notions of the funda|mental Security of the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, believing it to be a Threefold Cord, which is not &s;o ea&s;ily broken as &s;ome People imagine; yet neither am I &s;o &s;anguine as &s;ome others are, who de&s;pi&s;e all Notions of Danger to the Succe&s;&s;ion, and that &s;o much as even to
<PB N="19" REF="18">
render their Zeal for the &s;aid Prote|&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion to be ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected, who think the thing not worth once putting the Que&s;tion, either to them+&s;elves or any one el&s;e, about or &s;o much as to enquire, whether it be in Danger or no; I &s;ay, as I cannot go this length, &s;o I think there are divers very good Rea&s;ons why this previous Que&s;tion &s;hould be entred upon, <HI>(viz.) Whether the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion is really in Dan|ger or no;</HI> and al&s;o the &s;ub&s;equent Que|&s;tion, which, in its kind, is equally &s;ig|nificant to us, <HI>(viz.)</HI> What are the Cau&s;es of this Danger?</P>
<P>Yet let the Reader take Notice here, that it is not the pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s or De&s;ign of this Di&s;cour&s;e to decide the Que&s;tions them&s;elves, but to give the Rea&s;ons why the Nation ought to make the Enquiry in a methodical, legal man|ner, and to &s;tate the Que&s;tions &s;o, as we may neither be impo&s;ed upon to en|quire into what we have no Occa&s;ion to meddle with, or omit to meddle with what we ought to enquire into.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19">
This &s;eems to have more Weight in it than mo&s;t People perhaps may ima|gin, for after all the Heat we &s;ee practi|&s;ed among us, it is no Inju&s;tice or Ar|rogance to &s;ay, that neither Side go on right; neither THE ONE in pu&s;hing their Search into the&s;e matters more as Per&s;ons than as things, whereby they give their Enemies occa&s;ion to charge them, as they do very arrogantly, al|&s;o with carrying on their private Inte|re&s;t, and not the ju&s;t Concern of their Country, and with aiming to get into, rather than to reform the Manage|ment of Affairs. <HI>Nor the other,</HI> in which they really ca&s;t a Scandal upon the Mini&s;try at the &s;ame time that they defend them, in &s;tudiou&s;ly avoiding the Que&s;tion, as if they would &s;uppo&s;e the Per&s;ons concerned in the Admini&s;trati|on were afraid of the Enquiry, and apprehen&s;ive lea&s;t the Danger of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion &s;hould not only appear real, and that the Fears of the People &s;hould appear well grounded; But that tho&s;e Dangers &s;hould al&s;o be found to ari&s;e from <HI>their Male-Admini&s;tration,</HI> and that they are ju&s;tly to be charged
<PB N="21" REF="20">
with being the Cau&s;es of it; that they &s;hould be found to have weakened our Security, hazarded the Peace and Safe|ty of their Country, and to have en|couraged the Friends, &s;trengthened the Party, and rai&s;ed the Hopes of the Pre|tender, and made him &s;o ju&s;tly appear formidable to the People of this Nati|on: It is not only a manife&s;t Injury and Inju&s;tice to the Mini&s;ters of State, to &s;ugge&s;t the&s;e things of them with|out Proof, but it is al&s;o an irreparable Blow to their Character and Reputa|tion, and what I do not &s;ee they have given ju&s;t Occa&s;ion for; to &s;ugge&s;t that they them&s;elves &s;hould &s;hun the Enquiry, and endeavour either to put off the People from &s;earching into it, or that they &s;hould skreen them&s;elves under the Per&s;on of the Queen, tran&s;|po&s;ing the Que&s;tion from their own Management to that of the Queen's Admini&s;tration in general, and &s;o avoid the Examination politically, for fear of the Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>If the Mini&s;try are innocent, as I think my &s;elf bound in Charity to be|lieve, and that they are not in the In|tere&s;t
<PB N="22" REF="21">
of the <HI>Pretender, to &s;uggest other|wi&s;e, would be to give up their Sen&s;es as well as their Integrity.</HI> If I &s;ay they are innocent, no Man can do them a great|er piece of Inju&s;tice, than to decline the bringing their Admini&s;tration to the Te&s;t, that they may be clear'd before the whole World. Nor can any Man rai&s;e a greater Slander upon them, than to &s;ay or &s;ugge&s;t, that they are afraid of having that Admini&s;tration duly enquir'd into and examin'd. It is a Misfortune to an hone&s;t Man to be &s;u&s;pected, but it is a greater not to be able to obtain a ju&s;t Hearing; and therefore it has for|merly been complain'd of, that Men have been Impeached in Parliament without having Articles exhibited in Form, that the Cau&s;e might be brought to a Trial; nay, we have &s;een Men forwarding their own Pro&s;ecutions, petitioning for Trials, moving the Hou&s;e of Peers to bring them to Trial, whether Articles were exhibited or no, as was the Ca&s;e of the Five Lords impeach'd in the Time of the late Mini&s;try. Thus hone&s;t Men, when their Reputation has been a&s;&s;ault|ed, have always de&s;ired to have their Conduct put upon the &s;tricte&s;t Exami|nation,

that their Integrity may be ju|&s;tified to all the World; and I cannot doubt but that the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try are ready to &s;tand the Te&s;t of their Con|duct, and to join I&s;&s;ue with tho&s;e who are mo&s;t willing to enquire into their Admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t therefore crave leave to &s;up|po&s;e, that the Mini&s;ters of State now employ'd could not be guilty of &s;o weak a Step as to de&s;ire the afore&s;aid Words, <HI>The Queen's Admini&s;tration,</HI> &s;hould be added to the Que&s;tion, about the Dan|ger of the Succe&s;&s;ion, in order to pre|vent any Enquiry into their Manage|ment: But that, on the contrary, they are, as hone&s;t Men ought to be, ready to expo&s;e their Admini&s;tration to the &s;tricte&s;t Enquiry of all tho&s;e who have a Right to enquire into it.</P>
<P>I might enlarge here upon the Words, <HI>The Queen's Admini&s;tration,</HI> and examine what is to be under&s;tood by that Ex|pre&s;&s;ion; whence it would be nece&s;&s;ary to enquire, whether by <HI>The Queen's Ad|mini&s;tration</HI> is not to be under&s;tood the Conduct of Her Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="23">
We are very &s;ure the Queen Her&s;elf cannot willingly be brought into any thing to make Her People un&s;afe or un|ea&s;ie; and therefore when we &s;peak of the Succe&s;&s;ion being in Danger under <HI>Her Maje&s;ty's Admini&s;tration,</HI> it mu&s;t be under&s;tood under the Conduct of tho&s;e whom Her Maje&s;ty employs and en|tru&s;ts with the Admini&s;tration under Her; &s;o that no Man can &s;ugge&s;t that it was meant of Her Maje&s;ty's imme|diate Act or Deed. The Enquiry there|fore into the Admini&s;tration need not to have been declin'd by any, for fear of Affronting Her Maje&s;ty. We have al|ways been told, That the Queen is ac|countable to none for Her&s;elf: But we likewi&s;e know, That Her Mini&s;try are accountable in Parliament; and we have never found, that Her Maje&s;ty has pro|tected any of Her Servants from publick Ju&s;tice in any illegal Proceedings, and we hope &s;till that Her Maje&s;ty will not. So that as it is every Freeholder's Right in Parliament to demand an Account of the Conduct of tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with the Admini&s;tration, no other can be under&s;tood by what they call En|quiring
<PB N="25" REF="24">
into the Queen's Admini&s;tra|tion.</P>
<P>Having thus far cleared the Way to the Que&s;tion it &s;elf, I cannot &s;ee why a|ny one &s;hould be backward in a legal, dutiful, and re&s;pectful Manner, to en|quire into the Conduct of the greate&s;t publick Mini&s;ters, when they think their Country in Danger; and I cannot but think, that whoever promotes &s;uch an Enquiry, does the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try the mo&s;t faithful Service po&s;&s;ible, if they are innocent, as I mu&s;t be allow'd to &s;ay, I am fully per&s;waded they are.</P>
<P>I find in a late Pamphlet &s;ome Expo|&s;tulations in behalf of the pre&s;ent Mini|&s;try, which I cannot but join in with up|on this very Foundation, where the Au|thor, who he is I do not enquire, has the&s;e few, but mo&s;t &s;ignificant Expre&s;|&s;ions; <Q>&startq;&endq;The Mini&s;try court your Im|peachments, and demand to be charg|ed: They &s;ay, as the old Judge of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> God's Mini&s;ter of State, at the End of the Theocra&s;y of the Tribes; <HI>Who&s;e Ox or who&s;e A&s;s have I taken?</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="25">
<HI>and no Man &s;tands forth to accu&s;e them.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I crave Leave to agree with this Propo&s;al with the greate&s;t Alacrity ima|ginable, and that from the &s;ame Mo|tive with that Author, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of Ju&s;tice to the Mini&s;try; for if they are inno|cent, to impeach them, and bring them to the Te&s;t, mu&s;t have this happy Effect, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that being effectually cleared, there would be no more room for the Complaints of the People, which it cannot be very plea&s;ing to any innocent Per&s;on to lie under. No Man can &s;it down with a publick Scandal, and be ea&s;ie, without de&s;iring to be delivered from it, e&s;pecially when he knows him&s;elf to be innocent. There|fore I &s;ay al&s;o, <HI>Stand forth and accu&s;e them.</HI></P>
<P>On the other Hand, not to impeach them, is tacitly to acknowledge that they are innocent, and indeed is to take away the Rea&s;on of Complaint; for we ought no more to complain, if we cannot make out a Charge. The Mi|ni&s;try therefore will, I hope, not think

them&s;elves concerned, or be in the lea&s;t offended, if I &s;hould &s;ay, That if they are guilty of the many Things which People are apt to charge upon them; if the Danger of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Succe&s;|&s;ion is real, and is occa&s;ioned by their Mi&s;management; if they have taken &s;uch Mea&s;ures as are de&s;tructive of the publick Safety, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the Security of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;|&s;&s;ion; if they are &s;ecretly in Concert with the Pretender, and have laid Mea|&s;ures to bring him in upon us by a <HI>French</HI> Power; if they have betrayed their Tru&s;t to the Enemies of their Country, and have re&s;olved to &s;acrifice our <HI>Religion</HI> and Liberties to Popery and Slavery; if they have joined Mea|&s;ures with the Friends and Favourers of the Pretender, and to bring them in|to Act with them in &s;ome per&s;onal Ca&s;es, for the Support of their Intere&s;t and Places, have privately entered into Compact with them, to break the pre|&s;ent Con&s;titution, and the Settlement of the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion. If for this very Rea&s;on they have made the Peace, that the Intere&s;t of the Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e may be le&s;&s;ened, and at length

de&s;troyed, and that they may have a foreign Power to embarra&s;s and intangle the States General, and the other Allies of the &s;aid Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e, &s;o that they &s;hall not be in a Condition, ei|ther the latter to make an Attempt here for the Crown, in Ca&s;e of Her Maje&s;ty's Decea&s;e, or the former to a&s;|&s;i&s;t them. If the&s;e things, or any &s;uf|ficient Part of them, were true, or there was any ju&s;t Rea&s;on to believe them, it is hoped, <HI>Great Britain</HI> can never want &s;ome true Patriots, who would freely expo&s;e their own Safety &s;o far for their Country's Good, as to appear openly again&s;t &s;uch manife&s;t Attacks upon our Liberties and Con&s;titution, and who would endeavour, by all lawful Means, to bring &s;uch Offenders to pub|lick Ju&s;tice. No Relation, no Obliga|tion ought to deter from &s;o ju&s;t an At|tempt; if a Father, a Brother, a Friend, if the neare&s;t Tye of Blood, or the &s;tronge&s;t Tye of Gratitude were in the Way, it ought not to cover an Offence of that kind, and I could no more e|&s;teem him faithful to his Country, who refrained the falling upon &s;uch a Per&s;on, let his Dignity or Relation be what it

will, &s;obeit he took &s;uch Cour&s;e only as the Law and Con&s;titution directed, than I could e&s;teem them to be hone&s;t Men, who were guilty of the Facts.</P>
<P>It would &s;eem to be lo&s;t Labour to move any Body here to fall upon the Men that &s;hould be guilty in the Manner as above. No Men can need the Per&s;wa|&s;ion who have any Sen&s;e of the Safety of their Country; is not our own Safe|ty, and the Safety of our Po&s;terity, concerned in the pre&s;erving the Prote|&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion? Can we need Argu|ments to per&s;wade the People of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to pro&s;ecute tho&s;e as National Enemies, who act in the Intere&s;t of a Popi&s;h Pretender? It cannot be po&s;&s;ible that any true Prote&s;tant, who owns the Revolution, has taken the Abjuration, and profe&s;&s;es to be a Lover of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Liberty, &s;hould be backward to oppo&s;e any Per&s;on in &s;uch things as the&s;e, or &s;hould de&s;ire &s;uch Per&s;on or Per&s;ons &s;hould e&s;cape the Ju&s;tice of the Nation; and therefore if the&s;e things can be made appear upon any, in Mi|ni&s;try or out of Mini&s;try, be they where or who they may, every ho|ne&s;t
<PB N="30" REF="29">
Man will and mu&s;t give them up every hone&s;t Man will join heartily in the Pro&s;ecution of &s;uch, be it by Im|peachment, Indictment, Addre&s;s, or whatever other Method, either in Par|liament or out of Parliament, the Law &s;hall direct.</P>
<P><HI>Jacobites</HI> are the &s;worn and abjured Enemies of this Nation; their Idol the Pretender &s;tands attainted by Parlia|ment, and is a dead Man in the Sen&s;e of the Law of this Nation, whenever he &s;ets his Foot here. Whoever he is adheres to, abetts, or joins him in any Attempt, to place him&s;elf upon the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Throne, as well after the Queen<HI>'s</HI> Decea&s;e, as during Her Maje&s;ty's Life, is a Rebel, a Traytor, and an Invader of his Country, and ought not only to be put to Death as a Traytor, but to be pur&s;ued by every true <HI>Britain</HI> with all his Might, in order to be brought in, and be delivered up to Ju&s;tice, and in Ca&s;e of his refu&s;ing to &s;urrender him&s;elf to Ju&s;tice, or in Ca&s;e of his Re&s;i&s;tance, may be kill'd and de&s;troy'd, as a Traytor and Rebel, in open Arms again&s;t the Government, may be.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="30">
As this is true &s;o far as it relates to the open, plain Act of Inva&s;ion and Re|bellion, &s;o it is in its proportion true of every &s;ecret Contriver, and of every Per&s;on endeavouring to make Way for &s;uch an Attempt or Inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>If whoever &s;hall directly affirm, by Writing or Printing, that the Pretender has a Right to the Crown, is guilty of High Trea&s;on, and &s;hall die as a Traytor, as is enacted by the Law <HI>Annae, cap.</HI> Certainly he who by &s;ecret Concert with the Pretender, or with his Friends, Favourers, or Allies, engages to &s;et him upon the Throne, whether he by Right ought to enjoy it or no, is much more guilty of Trea|&s;on, and de&s;erves to &s;uffer as a Tray|tor.</P>
<P>And above all this, to have a Mini|&s;ter of State, who is entru&s;ted with the Admini&s;tration of Affairs, the executive Power, and the Authority of the Prince, to have any of the&s;e make u&s;e of that Pow|er and Authority, to prompt the Intere&s;t of the declared Enemy of their Country,
<PB N="32" REF="31">
it is a Trea&s;on of a blacker Nature, a Crime of a deeper Die than meaner Subjects can commit, and calls for the warme&s;t Re&s;entment, I mean, legal, that the People &s;o injured can expre&s;s; &s;uch Crimes cannot but create a Hor|ror in the Minds of the common People; and the Per&s;ons guilty, mu&s;t be the Aver&s;ion and Abomination of all that love the Queen and their Coun|try, or value their Religion and Liber|ties. The Aggravations of &s;uch a Crime are &s;ingular al&s;o, re&s;pecting the Per&s;ons guilty, who&s;e Places &s;ummon them, as Patriots, to an extraordinary Care of, and Concern for the Good of their Country; for the&s;e to be guil|ty of &s;o flagrant a Crime, as that of betraying us to Popery, and Popi&s;h Tyranny, as it is the wor&s;t kind of Ingratitude, &s;o it calls for the highe&s;t Re|&s;entment, and the &s;evere&s;t legal Puni&s;h|ment: And can it be po&s;&s;ible then, that there can want Patriots in this Nation, who&s;e Zeal for the Publick would lead them to pro&s;ecute the greate&s;t Crimi|nal, who can be guilty of &s;uch things as the&s;e, if the Fact can be proved?</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32">
But I mu&s;t all this while be allowed to expound this upon the Suppo&s;ition only of a clear Proof of Fact; I am none of tho&s;e who are for condemning the meane&s;t Subject any more than the greate&s;t, upon &s;ugge&s;ted Crimes, and &s;uppo&s;ititious Guilt. This would be to claim Ju&s;tice to our &s;elves, and de|ny it to other People, and deprive Mi|ni&s;ters of State of the Privileges of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subjects, while we complain of the Inva&s;ion of tho&s;e Privleges for our &s;elves. It is the Happine&s;s of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Nation, That their Privileges are Univer&s;al, and Ju&s;tice is to be admi|ni&s;tred with Equality, and without Fa|vour, or per&s;onal Re&s;pect, otherwi&s;e it would be no more Ju&s;tice, but Op|pre&s;&s;ion and Partiality.</P>
<P>I cannot but expre&s;s my Hopes and Belief, that the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try have acted with &s;uch Care of their Duty and Regard to the Laws, as to de&s;erve none of the Cen&s;ures which we find People &s;o willing to load them with; if they are guilty, every hone&s;t Man mu&s;t give them up; if not, no hone&s;t
<PB N="34" REF="33">
Man will condemn them. We are not trying them here, we have no|thing to do with the Charge, it mu&s;t and ought to lie in the ordinary Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice; and it were to be wi&s;h'd, that all Charges of this kind were more than they are left to the ordinary Cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice. Impeachment is bet|ter than Slander; every Man has a Right to bring a true Charge, and to try the Validity of that Charge, by the proper Judicatories of the Nation; but no Man has a Right to rai&s;e Scan|dals, evil Surmi&s;es, and Sugge&s;tions of Guilt without Ground, to wound the Reputation of Men, when they cannot otherwi&s;e touch them.</P>
<P>In clearing up the Right of every <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subject, to impeach and bring to Ju&s;tice the greate&s;t Criminal, I do the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try the greate&s;t Ser|vice that I am capable of doing, while &s;uppo&s;ing them innocent and clear of all that Scandal and Reproach, which is now heaped unju&s;tly, I doubt not, upon them. I take away all Ground or Encouragement for that hateful Me|thod of &s;landering Men without Proof,
<PB N="35" REF="34">
by &s;hewing how it is every Man's Duty, if he has Proof, to bring it forth, and bring the great Offender to Ju&s;tice; and if he has not, to cea&s;e the Complaint; and no more defame a Man unju&s;tly, than &s;entence him un|ju&s;tly.</P>
<P>I know it is too often alledged, that &s;ome Men, by their Po&s;t of Power and Favour, have &s;uch Influence on the Per&s;ons before whom they ought to be brought as Delinquents, that it is not to be expected that Ju&s;tice &s;hould take Place again&s;t them. I know not but this Complaint may have been too ju&s;t in &s;ome Ca&s;es, and I know <HI>Ireland</HI> is of late made an Example in the Opini|on of &s;ome, of this part; but I hope we have no Rea&s;on to fear that Extent of Power in the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try over that honourable Body of Peers who are to be the proper Judges in Appeals of this Nature. But to an&s;wer this once for all, Demon&s;trations of Fact have &s;uch a convincing Energy with them, as no Body of &s;uch Judges could ever with&s;tand, nor could any Influence be &s;uppo&s;ed to pre&s;erve the Majority a|gain&s;t
<PB N="36" REF="35">
it; for Truth made clear and undeniable can never be with&s;tood.</P>
<P>I can never allow that a Charge clearly made out, &s;hall not meet with a ju&s;t Trial from &s;uch a Body of Men, and from the &s;upream Judicature of <HI>Britain,</HI> and it would argue a Diffi|dence of the Proofs and Ju&s;tice of the Complainer, rather than a Partiality in the Hou&s;e of Peers, for any Man to object, that he will not impeach, be|cau&s;e he doubts whether he &s;hall have Ju&s;tice at the Bar of the Hou&s;e of Lords.</P>
<P>If the Fact can be made out, and Ju&s;tice cannot be obtained, the People of <HI>Great Britain</HI> will know then what Hands they are in, and know better what their own Circum&s;tances are, than now they can pretend to do. But till that Misfortune befals us, that we cannot have Ju&s;tice at the Bar of the Hou&s;e of Lords, I &s;ay, till that time comes, no Man can well an&s;wer it to the World, to ca&s;t a Reproach of &s;o black a Nature as this is upon a Mini|&s;ter of State, and this in &s;o Great and
<PB N="37" REF="36">
&s;o Augu&s;t an A&s;&s;embly as that of a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament, without endeavour|ing to bring the Per&s;on he charges to Ju&s;tice, or de&s;erving to be brought to Ju&s;tice him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It may be hard to determine how far any private Gentleman may be ob|liged to impeach a corrupt Mini&s;try, and thereby expo&s;e him&s;elf to be a Sa|crifice to the provoked Rage of a Man in Power, if he fails of the Succe&s;s. But it is not at all difficult to determine this, that for the Ea&s;e and Satisfaction of the Nation this ought either to be done, or the Complaint it &s;elf not be rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>For we are to do Ju&s;tice to all, as well tho&s;e who we oppo&s;e, as tho&s;e who we join with; and if we cannot make out the Charge, we ought not to let it be a Charge; if we can make it out, we ought not to fail of doing it. And I mu&s;t be impartial in this, as I would not be guilty of the &s;ame Inju&s;tice which I condemn, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that as if the Mini&s;try are guilty, no true <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Repre&s;entative ought to be afraid to
<PB N="38" REF="37">
detect and to impeach them; &s;o if they are not guilty, God forbid they &s;hould be charg'd at all. I am no more ac|quitting the Mini&s;try here, than I am condemning them; neither indeed am I either acquitting or condemning. It is a Charity due to all Men, to wi&s;h they may not be guilty of any thing which de&s;erves Puni&s;hment, and I wi&s;h &s;o here, and hope &s;till that all the Complaint, which has made &s;uch a Ferment in the Nation, may prove groundle&s;s; and I mu&s;t add, that if af|ter &s;o much &s;aid again&s;t them in this Affair of the Pretender, of the Mini|&s;try having favoured the Pretender, of the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hano|ver</HI> being in Danger from the Mini|&s;try, and of the Mini&s;try being in a private Concert to bring him in; if, I &s;ay, after all the&s;e things, no Man &s;hall have &s;o much Zeal for his Country, if he believes it all, as to impeach the Per&s;ons, who he is &s;o forward to &s;ay are guilty, it will turn all in favour of the Mini&s;try, it will be the greate&s;t Vin|dication of their Innocence that can po&s;&s;ibly be of the kind, and in&s;tead of
<PB N="39" REF="38">
taking &s;uch Men to be Patriots and Defenders of their Country, and of the Succe&s;&s;ion, People will be apt to &s;ay, they are in a Plot to e&s;tabli&s;h the Reputation of the Mini&s;try, and to ren|der all the Complaints of this Nature that either are, or &s;hall be brought a|gain&s;t them, ab&s;urd and ridiculous.</P>
