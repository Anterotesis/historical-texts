<Q>Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><HI>THE High and Lofty One who
inhabiteth eternity,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. I.</NOTE> <HI>dwelleth al&s;o
with him that is of humble and
contrite heart</HI> In the mid&s;t of
his glory, the Almighty is not inattentive
to the meane&s;t of his &s;ubjects. Neither
ob&s;curity of &s;tation, nor imperfection of
knowledge, &s;ink tho&s;e below his regard,
who wor&s;hip and obey him. Every prayer
<PB N="2" REF="11">
which they &s;end up from their &s;ecret re|tirement,
is li&s;tened to by him; and every
work of charity which they perform, how
unknow $ $$o$$ver to the world, attracts his
notice. The text per&s;ent, a &s;ignal in&s;tance
of this comfortable truth. In the city of
$$, there $word$ a Roman centurion,
a military officer of inferior rank, a Gen|tile,
$word$ by birth nor religion entitled
to the privileges of the Jewi&s;h nation. But
he was a devout and benevolent man;
who, according to his mea&s;ure of religious
knowledge, &s;tudied to perform his duty,
<HI>prayed to God always, and gave much alms
to the people.</HI> Such a character pa&s;&s;ed not
unob&s;erved, thy God. So highly was it
honoured, that to this good centurion an
angel was &s;ent from heaven, in order to
direct him to the means of full in&s;truction
in the truth. The angel acc&s;ts him with
this &s;alutation, <HI>Cornelius, Thy prayers and
thine alms are come up for a memorial before
god.</HI></P>
<P>It is to the conjunction of <HI>prayers and
alsm</HI> that I purpo&s;e now to direct your
<PB N="3" REF="12">
thoughts, as de&s;lxzcribing the re&s;pectable
and amiable character of a man, as form|ing
the honour and the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of a
true Chri&s;tian; piety joined with charity,
faith with good works, devotion with mo|rality.
The&s;e arc things which God hath
connected, and which it is impious in man
to &s;eparate. It is only when they remain
united, that they can come up as a grate|ful
<HI>memorial before God</HI> I &s;hall fir&s;t endea|vour
to &s;how you, That alms without
prayers, or prayers without alms, mora|lity
without devotion, or devotion without
morality, arc extremely defective; and
then &s;hall point out the happy effects of
their mutual union.</P>
<P>LET us begin with con&s;idering the ca&s;e
of alms without prayers; that is, of good
works without piety, or a proper &s;en&s;e of
God and Religion. This is no rare nor
uncommon ca&s;e. With many, Virtue is,
or at lea&s;t is pretended to be, a re&s;pectable
and an honoured name, while Piety
&s;ounds meanly in their ears. They are
<PB N="4" REF="13">
men of the world, and they claim to be
men of honour. They re&s;t upon their
humanity, their public &s;pirit, their pro|bity,
and their truth. They arrogate to
them&s;elves all the manly and the active
virtues. But devout affections and reli|gious
duties they treat with contempt, as
founded on &s;hadowy &s;peculations, and fit
to employ the attention only of weak and
&s;uper&s;titious minds. Now, in oppo&s;ition
to &s;uch per&s;ons, I contend, that this ne|glect
of piety argues depravity of heart;
and that it infers an irregular di&s;charge
of the duties of morality.</P>
<P>FIRST, It argues internal depravity; it
di&s;covers a cold and a hard heart, which
can never be a good one. If there be any
impre&s;&s;ion which man is formed by na|ture
to receive, it is a &s;en&s;e of religion.
As &s;oon as his mind opens to ob&s;ervation
and reflection, he di&s;cerns innumerable
marks of his dependent &s;tate. He finds
him&s;elf placed, by &s;ome &s;uperior power,
in a va&s;t world, where the wi&s;dom and
<PB N="5" REF="14">
goodne&s;s of the Creator are con&s;picuous
on every &s;ide. The magnificence, the
beauty and order of nature, excite him to
admire and adore. When he looks up
to that invi&s;ible hand which operates
throughout the univer&s;e, he is impre&s;&s;ed
with reverence. When he receives ble&s;|&s;ings
which he cannot avoid a&s;cribing to
divine goodne&s;s, he is prompted to grati|tude.
The expre&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e affections
under the various forms of religious wor|&s;hip,
are no other than native eff&s;ions of
the human heart. Ignorance may mi&s;|lead,
and &s;uper&s;tition corrupt them; but
their origin is derived from &s;entiments
that are e&s;&s;ential to man.</P>
<P>Ca&s;l your eyes over the whole earth.
Explore the mo&s;t remote quarters of die
ea&s;t or the we&s;t. You may di&s;cover tribes
of men without policy, or laws, or cities,
or any of the arts of life: But no where
(&s;hall you find them without &s;ome form
of religion. In every region you behold
the pro&s;trate wor&s;hipper, the temple, and
the offering. Wherever men have exi&s;ted,
<PB N="6" REF="15">
they have been &s;en&s;ible that &s;ome acknow|ledgment
was due on their part, to the
Former of the world. If in their rude&s;t
and mo&s;t ignorant &s;tate, this obligation
has been confe&s;&s;ed, how much is it in|crea&s;ed
by the improvements of human
knowledge, but e&s;pecially by the great
di&s;coveries of the Chri&s;tian revelation?
Whatever, either from reverence or from
gratitude, can excite mew to the wor&s;hip of
God, is by this revelation placed in &s;uch
a light as one &s;hould think were &s;ufficient
to over-awe the mo&s;t thoughtle&s;s, and to
melt the mo&s;t obdurate mind.</P>
<P>Can&s;t thou, then, pretend to be a man
of rea&s;on, nay, a man of virtue, and yet
continue regardle&s;s of one of the fir&s;t and
chief dictates of human nature? Where
is thy &s;en&s;ibility to what is right and fit,
if that loud voice which calls all nations
throughout the earth to religious homage,
has never been heard by thee? Or, if it
has been heard, by what &s;trange and
fal&s;e refinements ha&s;t thou &s;tifled tho&s;e
natural &s;entiments which it tends to a|waken?
<PB N="7" REF="16">
Calling thy&s;elf a &s;on, a citizen,
a friend; claiming to be faithful and af|fectionate
in the&s;e relations; ha&s;t thou
no &s;en&s;e of what thou owe&s;t to thy fir&s;t
Parent, thy highe&s;t Sovereign, thy great|e&s;t
Benefactor? Can it be con&s;tinent with
true virtue or honour, to value thy&s;elf up|on
thy regard to inferior obligations, and
yet to violate that which is the mo&s;t &s;acred
and the mo&s;t ancient of all? When &s;imple
in&s;tinct teaches the Tartar and the Indian,
together with his alms and good works
to join his prayers to that Power whom
he con&s;iders as the &s;ource of good, &s;hall
it be no reproach, in the mo&s;t enlightened
&s;tate of human nature, and under the
pure&s;t di&s;pen&s;ation of religion, to have
extingui&s;hed the &s;en&s;e of gratitude to Hea|ven,
and to &s;light all acknowledgment of
the great and the true God? What does
&s;uch conduct imply, but either an entire
want, or a wilful &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of &s;ome of
the be&s;t and mo&s;t generous affections be|longing
to human nature?&mdash;Surely, there
mu&s;t be an e&s;&s;ential defect in that heart
<PB N="8" REF="17">
which remains cold and in&s;en&s;ible, where
it ought to be affected mo&s;t warmly.
Surely, &s;uch a degree of depravity mu&s;t
be lodged there, as is &s;ufficient to taint
all die other &s;prings of pretended virtue.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides this, I mu&s;t contend, in
the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, That where religion is
neglected, there can be no regular nor
&s;teady practice of the duties of morality.
The character, will be often incon&s;i&s;tent;
and Virtue placed on a ba&s;is too narrow to
&s;upport it, will be always loo&s;e and tot|tering.
For &s;uch is the propen&s;ity of our
nature to vice, &s;o numerous are the tempt|ations
to a relaxed and immoral conduct,
that &s;tronger re&s;traints than tho&s;e of mere
rea&s;on are nece&s;&s;ary to be impo&s;ed on
man. The &s;en&s;e of right and wrong, the
principle of honour, or the in&s;tinct of be|nevolence,
are barriers too feeble to with|&s;tand
the &s;trength of pa&s;&s;on. In the
tranquil &s;ea&s;ons of life, the&s;e natural prin|ciples
may, perhaps, carry on the ordi|nary
cour&s;e of &s;ocial duties with &s;ome re|gularity.
<PB N="9" REF="18">
But wait until &s;ome trying
emergence come. Let the conflict of pa&s;|&s;ions
ari&s;e. Let the heart be either wound|ed
by &s;ore di&s;tre&s;s, or agitated by violent
emotions; and you &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee that
virtue without religion is inadequate to
the government of life. It is de&s;titute of
its proper guard, of its firme&s;t &s;upport,
of its chief encouragement. It will &s;ink
tinder the weight of misfortune; or will
yield to the &s;olicitation of guilt.</P>
<P>The great motives that produce con|&s;tancv
and firmne&s;s of action mu&s;t be of
a palpable and &s;triking kind: A Divine
Legi&s;lator uttering his voice from heaven;
an Omni&s;cient Witne&s;s beholding us in
all our retreats; an Almighty Governour
&s;tretching forth his arm to puni&s;h or re|ward,
di&s;clo&s;ing the &s;ecrets of the invi&s;ible
world, informing us of perpetual re&s;t
prepared hereafter for the righteous, and
everla&s;ting &s;orrows for the wicked: The&s;e
are the con&s;iderations which over-awe the
world, which &s;upport integrity and check
guilt. They add to virtue that &s;olemnity
<PB N="10" REF="19">
which &s;hould ever characterize it. To
the admonitions of con&s;cience they give
the authority of a law. Co-operating
with all the good di&s;po&s;itions of a pious
man, they &s;trengthen and in&s;ure their in|&s;luence.
On his alms you can have no
certain dependence, who thinks not of
God, nor has ever joined prayer to his
charitable deeds. But when humanity is
&s;econded by piety, the &s;pring from which
it flows is rendered, of cour&s;e, more re|gular
and con&s;tant.&mdash;In &s;hort, withdraw
religion, and you &s;hake all the pillars of
morality. In every heart you weaken the
influence of virtue: And among the mul|titude,
the bulk of mankind, you over|throw
its power.</P>
<P>HAVING thus &s;hewn that morality
without devotion is both defective and
un&s;table, I proceed to con&s;ider the other
extreme, of prayers without alms, devo|tion
without morality.</P>
<P>In every age the practice has prevailed,
of &s;ub&s;tituting certain appearances of piety
<PB N="11" REF="20">
in the place of the great duties of huma|nity
and mercy. Too many there have
always been who flatter them&s;elves with
the hope of obtaining the friend&s;hip of
their Creator, though they neglect to do
ju&s;tice to their fellow-creatures. But &s;uch
per&s;ons may be a&s;&s;ured, that their &s;uppo&s;|ed
piety is altogether of a &s;purious kind.
It is an invention of their own, unknown
to rea&s;on, unknown in the word of God.
In &s;cripture we are ever directed to try
our faith by our works, our love of God
by our love of men. We are directed to
con&s;ider piety as a principle which rege|nerates
the heart, and forms it to good|ne&s;s.
We are taught that in vain we ad|-dre&s;s
any acts of homage to Chri&s;t, un|le&s;s
we <HI>do the things which he &s;aith;</HI> and
that <HI>love, peace, gentlene&s;sy goodne&s;s, meek|ne&s;s</HI>
and <HI>temperance, are</HI> not only the in|junctions
of his law, but the native <HI>fruits
of his &s;pirit</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Luke vi. 46. Gal. V. 22.</NOTE>. If therefore while piety &s;eems ardent, morality &s;hall decline, you have
full rea&s;on to believe that into that piety
<PB N="12" REF="21">
&s;ome corrupting ingredients have entered.
And if ever your regard to morality &s;hall
totally fail; if, while you make many
prayers, you give no alms; if, while you
appear to be zealous for God, you are
fal&s;e or unju&s;t to men; if you arc hard or
contracted in heart, &s;evere in your cen|&s;ures,
and oppre&s;&s;ive in your conduct;
then, conclude with certainty, that what
you had termed piety was no more than
an empty name. For as &s;oon, according
to the &s;cripture &s;imilitude, will <HI>bitter wa|ters
flow from a &s;weet fountain</HI> or thi&s;tles
become the fruit of the vine, as &s;uch ef|fects
be produced by genuine piety.</P>
<P>What you have called by that name,
re&s;blves it&s;elf into one or other of three
things. Either it is a hypocritical form
of godline&s;s, a&s;&s;umed in order to impo&s;e
on. the world; or, which is the mo&s;t fa|vourable
&s;uppo&s;ition, it is a tran&s;ient im|pre&s;&s;ion
of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, an accidental melt|ing
of the heart, which <HI>pa&s;&s;es away like
the morning cloud and the early dew;</HI> or,
which I am afraid is too often the ca&s;e,
<PB N="13" REF="22">
it is the deliberate refuge of a deluded and
&s;uper&s;titious, but at the &s;ame time a cor|rupted
mind. For all men, even the mo&s;t
depraved, are &s;ubject, more or le&s;s, to
compunctions of con&s;cience. It has never
been in their power to withdraw totally
beyond the reach of that warning voice,
which tells them that &s;oemthing is nece&s;|&s;ary
to be done, in order to make their
peace with the Ruler of the world. But,
backward at the &s;ame time to re&s;ign the
gains of di&s;hone&s;ty, or the plea&s;ures of vice,
a ver&s;e from &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to that &s;acred law
which enjoins reghteou&s;ne&s;s in its whole
extent, they have often attempted to make
a &s;ort of compo&s;ition with Heaven; a com|po&s;ition,
which, though they dare not a|vow
it words, lurks in &s;ecret, at the bot|tom
of many a heart. If God will only
di&s;pen&s;e with &s;ome articles of obedience,
they will repay him with abundant ho|mage:
If they fail in good practice, they
will &s;tudy to be &s;ound in belief; and, by
the number of their prayers, will atone,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, for their deficiency in
charitable deeds.
<PB N="14" REF="23">
But the attempt is as vain, as it is im|pious.
From the &s;imple&s;t and plaine&s;t
principles of rea&s;on it mu&s;t appear, that
religious wor&s;hip, disjoined from ju&s;tice
and virtue, can upon no account what|ever
find acceptance with God. <HI>To what
purpo&s;e is the multitude of your &s;acrifices un|to
me? &s;aith the Lord. Brings no more vain
oblations. Incen&s;e is an abomination unto me.
The new moons and &s;abbaths, the calling of
a&s;&s;emblies, I cannot away with; if is iniqui|ty,
even the &s;olemn meeting</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ifa. i. II, 14.</NOTE>.&mdash;Cea&s;e, fooli&s;h
and impious man! Cea&s;e to con&s;ider the
Almighty as a weak or vain-glorious be|ing,
who is to be appea&s;ed by thy devout
pro&s;trations and thy humble -words; or
to be gratified by the parade and o&s;tenta|tion
of external wor&s;hip. What is all thy
wor&s;hip to him? <HI>Will he eat the fle&s;h of
thy &s;acrifices, or drink the blood of offered
goats?</HI> Was wor&s;hip required of thee,
do&s;t thou think, upon his account, that
thou mighte&s;t bring any increa&s;e to his
glory and felicity by thy weak and in&s;ig|nificant
<PB N="15" REF="24">
prai&s;es? Sooner mighte&s;t thou
increa&s;e the &s;plendor of the &s;un by a
lighted taper, or add to the thunder by
thy voice. No: It is for the &s;ake of man,
not of God, that wor&s;hip and prayers are
required; not that God may be rendered
more glorious, but that man may be made
better; that he may be confirmed in a
proper &s;en&s;e of his dependent &s;tate, and
acquire tho&s;e pious and virtuous di&s;po&s;i|tions
by which he draws near to God.</P>
<P>Of all the principles in religion, one
&s;hould take this to be the mo&s;t evident;
and yet, frequent admonitions are needed
to renew the impre&s;&s;ion of it upon man|kind.
For what purpo&s;e did God place
thee in this world, in the mid&s;t of human
&s;ociety, but that as a man among men
thou mighte&s;t cultivate humanity; that

<P>I HAVE now &s;hown the evil of maim|ing
and &s;plitting religion; of dividing
a&s;under two things, which though in
theory they may be &s;eparated, yet in
practice mu&s;t always co-exi&s;t if either of
them be real, Devotion to God, and Cha|rity
to men. Let us con&s;ider next the
happy effects of their union.</P>
<P>Their union forms the con&s;i&s;tent, the
graceful, the re&s;pectable character of the
real Chri&s;trian, the man of true worth. If
you leave either of them out of your &s;y|&s;tem,
even though you excel in the other,
you can &s;tand trial only in one point of
view. It is only on one &s;ide your cha|racter
is fair; on the other, it will always
be open to much reproach. And as you
di&s;honour your&s;elves, &s;o you do great in|ju&s;tice
to religion. For by dividing its
parts from one another, you never fail to
expo&s;e it to the cen&s;ure of the world:
And perhaps, by this &s;ort of partial and
<PB N="18" REF="27">
divided goodne&s;s, religion has &s;uffered
more in the e&s;teem of mankind, than by
open profligacy. The unbeliever will
&s;coff at your piety, when he &s;ees you ne|gligent
of moral duties. The bigot will
run down all morality, when he &s;ees you
pretending to be a follower of virtue,
though you be a de&s;pi&s;er of God. Where|as
he who fears God, and is at the &s;ame
time ju&s;t and beneficent to men, exhibits
religion to the world with full propriety.
It thines in his conduct with its native
&s;plendor; and its rays throw a glory
round him. His character is above re|proach.
It is at once amiable and vene|rable.
Malice it&s;elf is afraid to attack
him; and even the wor&s;t men re&s;pect
and honour him in their hearts.</P>
<P>This too is the man who&s;e life will be
mo&s;t peaceful and happy. He who fails
materially either in piety or in virtue, is
always obnoxious to the angui&s;h of re|mor&s;e.
His partial goodne&s;s may flatter
him in the day of &s;uperficial ob&s;ervation;
but when &s;olitude or di&s;tre&s;s awakens the
<PB N="19" REF="28">
powers of reflection, he &s;hall be made to
feel, that one part of duty performed
atones not for another which is neglected.
In the mid&s;t of his prayers the remem|brance
of inju&s;tice will upbraid him with
hypocri&s;y; and in the di&s;tribution of his
alms, the prayers which the poor put up
for him will make him blu&s;h for his ne|glect
of God. Con&s;cience will &s;upply the
place of the hand coming forth to write
over again&s;t him on the wall, <HI>Thou art
weighed in the balance, and art found want|ing</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dan. v. 27.</NOTE>. Whereas he who <HI>holds faith and a good con&s;cience together,</HI> who attends equal|ly
to the di&s;charge of his duty towards
God and towards man, enjoys, as far as
human imperfection allows, the &s;en&s;e of
fairne&s;s and con&s;i&s;tency in conduct, of in|tegrity
and &s;oundne&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>The man of mere morality is a &s;tranger
to all the delicate and refined plea&s;ures of
devotion. In works of beneficence and
mercy, he may enjoy &s;atisfaction. But his
&s;atisfaction is de&s;titute of that glow of af|fection
<PB N="20" REF="29">
which enlivens the feelings of one
who lifts his heart at the &s;ame time to
the Father of the univer&s;e, and con&s;iders
him&s;elf as imitating God. The man a|gain
who re&s;ts &s;olely on devotion, if that
devotion open not his heart to humanity,
not only remains a &s;tranger to the plea|&s;ures
of beneficence, but mu&s;t often un|dergo
the pain ari&s;ing from bad pa&s;&s;ions.
But unite together beneficence and devo|tion,
and you pour upon the man in
whom they are united, the full plea&s;ures
of a good and pure heart. His alms con|nect
him with men; his prayers with
God. He looks without di&s;may on both
worlds. All nature has to him a benign
a&s;pect. If engaged in active life, he is the
friend of men; and he is happy in the
exertions of that friend&s;hip. If left in
retirement, he walks among the works of
nature, as with God. Every object is en|livened
to him by the &s;en&s;e of the divine
pre&s;ence. Every where he traces the be|neficent
hand of the Author of nature;
and every where, with glowing heart,
<PB N="21" REF="30">
he hears and an&s;wers his &s;ecret voice.
When he looks up to heaven, he rejoices
in the thought that there dwells that God
whom he &s;erves and honours; that Sa|viour
in whom he tru&s;ts; that Spirit of
grace from who&s;e in&s;piration his piety and
his charity flow. When he looks around
him on the world, he is &s;oothed with the
plea&s;ing remembrance of the good offices
which he has done, or at lea&s;t has &s;tudied
to do, to many who dwell there. How
comfortable the reflection, that him no
poor man can upbraid for having with|held
his due; him no unfortunate man
can reproach for having &s;een and de&s;pi&s;ed
his &s;orrows; but that on his head are de|&s;cending
the prayers of the needy and the
aged; and that the hands of tho&s;e whom
his protection has &s;upported, or his boun|ty
has fed, are lifted up in &s;ecret to ble&s;s
him!</P>
<P>Life pa&s;&s;ed under the influence of &s;uch
di&s;po&s;itions, naturally leads to a happy
end. It is not enough to &s;ay, that faith
and piety, joined with active virtue, con|&s;titute
<PB N="22" REF="31">
the requi&s;ite preparation for hea|ven.
They in truth begin the enjoyment
of heaven. In every &s;tate of our exi&s;tence
they form the chief ingredients of felicity.
Hence they arc the great marks of Chri|&s;tian
regeneration. They are the &s;igna|ture
of that Holy Spirit, by which good
men are &s;aid to be <HI>&s;ealed unto the day of
redemption.</HI>&mdash;Of the e&s;timation in which
they are held by God, the text affords a
&s;triking proof. Amid&s;t that infinite va|riety
of human events which pa&s;s under
his eye, the prayers and the alms of Cor|nelius
attracted his particular notice. He
remarked the amiable di&s;po&s;itions which
ro&s;e in the heart of this good man. But
he &s;aw that they were yet imperfect,
while he remained unenlightened by the
principles of the Chri&s;tian religion. To
remove this ob&s;truction to his ri&s;ing
graces, and to bring him to the full
knowledge of that God whom he &s;ought
to honour, he was favoured with a &s;uper|natural
me&s;&s;age from heaven. While the
princes of the earth were left to act by
<PB N="23" REF="32">
the coun&s;els of their own wi&s;dom; while,
without interpo&s;ition. from, above, Ge|nerals
conquered or fell, according to the
vici&s;&s;itude of human things; to this good
centurion an angel was commi&s;&s;ioned
from the throne of God.</P>
<P>What then can I &s;ay more or higher in
prai&s;e of this ble&s;&s;ed character, than that
it is what God delights to honour? Men
&s;ingle out as the objects of di&s;tinction, the
great, the brave, or the renowned. But he
<HI>who &s;eeth not as man &s;eeth,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by tho&s;e
qualities which often &s;hine with fal&s;e
&s;plendor to human ob&s;ervation, looks to
the inward principles of action; to tho&s;e
principles which form the e&s;&s;ence of a
worthy character; and which, if called
forth, would give birth to whatever is
laudable or excellent in conduct.&mdash;Is there
one, though in humble &s;tation or ob&s;cure

<BIBL>PSALM xxvii. 5.</BIBL>
<Q>In the time of trouble, he &s;hall hide me in

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE life of man has always been a
very mixed &s;tate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. II</NOTE> full of uncertainty
and vici&s;&s;itude, of anxieties and fears. In
every religious audience, there are many
who fall under the denomination of the
unfortunate; and the re&s;t are ignorant
how &s;oon they may be called to join them.
For the pro&s;erity of no man on earth is
&s;table and a&s;&s;ured. Dark clouds may &s;oon
gather over the heads of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;ky
is now mo&s;t bright. In the mid&s;t of the
<PB N="26" REF="35">
deceitful calm which they enjoy, the &s;torm
that is to overwhelm them has perhaps
already begun to ferment. <HI>If a man live
many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let
$word$ remember the days of darkne&s;s, for they
&s;hall be many</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lcclef. xi. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>Hence, to a thoughtful mind, no &s;tudy
can appear more important, than how to
be &s;uitably prepared for the misfortunes
of life; &s;o as to contemplate them in pro|&s;pect
without di&s;may, and, if they mu&s;t
befal, to bear them with the lea&s;t dejection.
Throughout every age, the wi&s;dom of the
wi&s;e, the trea&s;ures of the rich, and the
power of the mighty, have been employed
either in guarding their &s;tate again&s;t the
approach of di&s;tre&s;s, or in rendering them|&s;elves
le&s;s vulnerable by its attacks. Power
has endeavoured to remove adver&s;ity to a
di&s;tance: Philo&s;ophy has &s;tudied, when it
drew nigh, to conquer it by patience; and
Wealth has &s;ought out every plea&s;ure that
can compen&s;ate or alleviate pain.</P>
<P>While the wi&s;dom of the world is thus
occupied, religion has been no le&s;s atten|tive
<PB N="27" REF="36">
to the &s;ame important object. It in|forms
us in the text, of <HI>a pavilion</HI> which
God erects to &s;helter his &s;ervants <HI>in the
time of trouble,</HI> of a <HI>&s;ecret place in his taber|nacle</HI>
into which he brings them, of a
<HI>rock on which he &s;ets them up;</HI> and el&s;e|where
it tells us of a <HI>&s;hield and a buckler</HI>
which he &s;preads before them, to <HI>cover
them from the terror by night, and the ar|row
that flieth by day.</HI> Now, of what na|ture
are tho&s;e in&s;truments of defence
which God is repre&s;ented as providing
with &s;uch &s;olicitous care for tho&s;e who
fear him? Has he reared up any bul|warks,
impregnable by misfortune, in
order to &s;eparate the pious and virtuous
from the re&s;t of mankind, and to &s;creen
them from the common di&s;a&s;ters of life?
No: To tho&s;e di&s;a&s;ters we behold them
liable no le&s;s than others. The defence
which religion provides, is altogether of
an internal kind. It is the heart, not the
outward &s;tate, which it profe&s;&s;es to guard.
When the <HI>time of trouble</HI> comes, as come
it mu&s;t to all, it places good men under
<PB N="28" REF="37">
<HI>the pavilion</HI> of the Almighty, by afford|ing
them that &s;ecurity and peace which
ari&s;e from the belief of divine protection.
It brings them into the &s;ecret of his taber|nacle,
by opening to them &s;ources of con|&s;olation
which are hidden from others. By
that &s;trength of mind with which it en|dows
them, it <HI>&s;ets them up upon a rock,</HI> a|gain&s;t
which the tempe&s;t may violently
beat, but which it cannot &s;hake.</P>
<P>How far the comforts proceeding from
religion merit tho&s;e high titles under
which they are here figuratively de&s;crib|ed,
I &s;hall in this di&s;cour&s;e endeavour to
&s;how. I &s;hall for this end compare to|gether
the &s;ituation of bad men and that
of the good, when both are &s;uffering the
misfortunes of life; and then make &s;uch
improvement as the &s;ubject will naturally
&s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>1. RELIGION prepares the mind for en|countering
with fortitude, the mo&s;t &s;evere
&s;hocks of adver&s;ity; whereas vice, by its
natural influence on the temper, tends to
<PB N="29" REF="38">
produce dejection under the &s;ighte&s;t trials.
While worldly men enlarge their po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions,
and extend their connections, they
imagine that they are &s;trengthening them|&s;elves
again&s;t all the po&s;&s;ible vici&s;&s;itudes of
life. They &s;ay in their hearts, <HI>My moun|tain
&s;tands &s;trong, and I &s;hall never be mov|ed.</HI>
But &s;o fatal is their delu&s;ion, that in|&s;tead
of &s;trengthening, they are weaken|ing
that which only can &s;upport them
when tho&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes come. It is their
mind which mu&s;t then &s;upport them; and
their mind, by their &s;en&s;ual attachments,
they corrupt and weaken. Addicted with
intemperate fondne&s;s to the plea&s;ures of
the world, they incur two great and cer|tain
evils; they both exclude them&s;elves
from every re&s;ource except the world,
and they increa&s;e their &s;en&s;ibility to every
blow which comes upon them, from that
quarter.</P>
<P>They have neither principles nor temper
which can &s;tand the a&s;&s;ault of trouble.
They have no principles which lead them
to look beyond the ordinary rotation of
<PB N="30" REF="39">
events; and therefore, when misfortunes
involve them, the pro&s;pect mu&s;t be com|fortle&s;s
on every &s;ide. Their crimes have
di&s;qualified them for looking up to the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any higher power than their
own ability, or for relying on any better
guide than their own wi&s;dom. And as
from principle they can derive no &s;up|port,
&s;o in a temper corrupted by pro&s;|perity
they find no relief. They have
lo&s;t that moderation of mind which en|ables
a wi&s;e man to accommodate him&s;elf
to his &s;ituation. Long fed with fal&s;e hopes,
they are exa&s;perated and &s;tung by every
di&s;appointment. Luxurious and effemi|nate,
they can bear no unea&s;ine&s;fs: Proud
and pre&s;umptuous, they can brook no
oppo&s;ition. By nouri&s;hing di&s;po&s;itions
which &s;o little &s;uit this uncertain &s;tate,
they have infu&s;ed a double portion of bit|terne&s;s
into the cup of woe; they have
&s;harpened the edge of that &s;word which
is lifted up to &s;mite them. Strangers to all
the temperate &s;atisfactions of a good and
a pure mind; &s;trangers to every plea&s;ure
<PB N="31" REF="40">
except what was &s;ea&s;oned by vice or va|nity,
their adver&s;ity is to the la&s;t degree
di&s;con&s;olate. Flouri&s;hing health, and fa|vourable
fortune, were the two pillars on
which they re&s;ted. Shake either of them;
and down falls their whole edifice of hope
and comfort. Pro&s;trate and forlorn, they
are left on the ground; obliged to join
with the man of Ephraim in his abject
lamentation, <HI>They have taken away my gods
which I had made, and what have I more</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Judges xviii. 24.</NOTE>?&mdash;Such are the cau&s;es to which we mu&s;t
a&s;cribe the broken &s;pirits, the peevi&s;h tem|per,
and impatient pa&s;&s;ions, that &s;o often
attend the declining age, or falling for|tunes
of vicious men.</P>
<P>But how different is the condition of a
truly good man in tho&s;e trying &s;ituations
of life! Religion had gradually prepared
his mind for all the events of this incon|&s;tant
&s;tate. It had in&s;tructed him in the
nature of true happine&s;s. It had early
weaned him from the undue love of the
world, by di&s;covering to him its vanity,
and by &s;etting higher pro&s;pects in his
<PB N="32" REF="41">
view. Afflictions do not attack hint by
&s;urpri&s;e, and therefore do not overwhelm
him. He was equipped for the &s;torm, as
well as the calm, in this dubious naviga|tion
of life. Under tho&s;e conditions he
knew him&s;elf to be brought hither, that
he was not to retain always the enjoyment
of what he loved: And therefore he is not
overcome by di&s;appointment, when that
which is mortal, dies; when that which
it mutable, begins to change; and that
which he knew to be tran&s;ient, pa&s;&s;es
away.</P>
<P>All the principles which religion teaches,
and all the habits which it forms, are fa|vourable
to &s;trength of mind. It will be
&s;ound, that whatever purifies, fortifies al|&s;o
the heart. In the cour&s;e of living <HI>righ|teou&s;ly
&s;oberly and godly,</HI> a good man ac|quires
a &s;teady and well-governed &s;pirit.
Trained, by God's grace, to enjoy with
moderation the advantages of the world,
neither lifted up by &s;ucce&s;s, nor enervated
with &s;en&s;uality, he meets the changes in
his lot without unmanly dejection: He is
<PB N="33" REF="42">
inured to temperance and re&s;traint. He has
learned firmne&s;s and &s;elf-command. He
is accu&s;tomed to look up to that Supreme
Providence which di&s;po&s;es of human af|fairs,
not with reverence only, but with
tru&s;t and hope.</P>
<P>The time of pro&s;perity was to him not
merely a &s;ea&s;on of barren joy, but pro|ductive
of much u&s;eful improvement.
He had properly cultivated his mind: He
had &s;tored it with u&s;eful knowledge, with
good principles, and virtuous di&s;po&s;itions.
The&s;e re&s;ources remain entire, when the
days of trouble come. They remain with
him in &s;ickne&s;s, as in health; in poverty,
as in the mid&s;t of riches; in his dark and
&s;olitary hours, no le&s;s than when &s;ur|rounded
with friends and gay &s;ociety.
From the glare of pro&s;perity, he can,
without dejection, withdraw into the
&s;hade. Excluded from &s;everal advantages
of the world, he may be obliged to retreat
into a narrower circle; but within that
circle he will find many comforts left.
His chief plea&s;ures were always of the
<PB N="34" REF="43">
calm, innocent, and temperate kind; and
over the&s;e, the changes of the world have
the lea&s;t power. His mind is a kingdom
to him; and he can &s;till enjoy it. The
world did not be&s;tow upon him all his
enjoyments; and therefore it is not in the
power of the world, by its mo&s;t cruel at|tacks,
to carry them all away.</P>
<P>II. THE di&s;tre&s;&s;es of life are alleviated to
Good men by reflections on their pa&s;t con|duct
while, by &s;uch reflections, they are
highly aggravated to the bad. During
the gay and active periods of life, &s;inners
elude, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the force of con|&s;cience.
Carried round in the whirl of af|fairs
and plea&s;ures; intent on contrivance,
or eager in pur&s;uit; amu&s;ed by hope, or
elated by enjoyment, they are &s;heltered
bv that croud of trifles which &s;urrounds
them, from, &s;erious thought. But con|&s;cience
is too great a power to remain al|ways
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed. There is in every man's
life, a period when he &s;hall be made to
&s;tand forth as a real object to his own
<PB N="35" REF="44">
view: And when that period comes, Wo
to him who is galled by the &s;ight! In the
dark and &s;olitary hour of di&s;tre&s;s, with a
mind hurt and &s;ore from &s;ome recent
wound of fortune, how &s;hall he bear to
have his character for the firt time di&s;|clo&s;ed
to him, in that humiliating; light
under which guilt will nece&s;&s;arily pre&s;ent
it? Then, the recollection of the pa&s;t be|comes
dreadful. It exhibits to him a life
thrown away on vanities and follies, or
con&s;umed in flagitiou&s;ne&s;s and &s;in; no
&s;tation properly &s;upported; no material
duties fulfilled. Crimes which once had
been ea&s;ily palliated, ri&s;e before him in
their native deformity. The &s;en&s;e of guilt
mixes it&s;elf with all that has befallen him.

the hand of the God whom he hath of|fended,
openly &s;tretched out again&s;t him.
&mdash;At a &s;ea&s;on when a man &s;tands mo&s;t in
need of &s;upport, how intolerable is the
weight of this additional load, aggravat|ing
the depre&s;&s;ion of di&s;ea&s;e, di&s;appoint|ment,
or old age! How mi&s;erable his
<PB N="36" REF="45">
&s;tate, who is condemned to endure at once
the pangs of guilt, and the vexations of
calamity! <HI>The &s;pirit of a man may &s;u&s;tain
his infirmities; but a wounded &s;pirit, who
can bear?</HI></P>
<P>Whereas, he who is ble&s;&s;ed with a clear
con&s;cience, enjoys, in the wor&s;t conjunc|tures
of human life, a peace, a dignity, an
elevation of mind peculiar to virtue. The
te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience is indeed
to be always di&s;tingui&s;hed from that
pre&s;umptuous boa&s;t of innocence, which
every good Chri&s;tian totally di&s;claims.
The better he is, he will be the more
humble, and &s;en&s;ible of his failings. But
though he acknowledge that he can claim
nothing from God, upon the footing of
de&s;ert, yet he can tru&s;t in his merciful
acceptance through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, accord|ing
to the terms of the go&s;pel. He can
hope that his <HI>prayers and his alms have
come tip in memorial before God.</HI> The piety
and virtue of his former life were as &s;eeds
&s;own in his pro&s;perous &s;tate, of which he
reaps the fruits in the &s;ea&s;on of adver&s;ity.
<PB N="37" REF="46">
The riches, the plea&s;ures, and the friends
of the world, may have made <HI>wings to
them&s;elves, and flown away.</HI> But the im|provement
which he made of tho&s;e advan|tages
while they la&s;ted, the temperate
&s;pirit with which he enjoyed them, the
beneficent actions which he performed,
and the good example which he &s;et to
others, remain behind. By the memory
of the&s;e, he enjoys his pro&s;perity a &s;e|cond
time in reflection; and perhaps this
&s;econd and reflected enjoyment is not in|ferior
to the fir&s;t. It arrives at a more
critical and needful time. It affords him
the high &s;atisfaction of having extracted
la&s;ting plea&s;ure from that which is &s;hort;
and of having fixed that which by its na|ture
was changing.&mdash;&startq;If my race be
now about to end, I have this comfort,
that it has not been run in vain. <HI>I have
fought the good fight; I have kept the
faith. My mind has no load. Futurity
has no terrors. I have endeavoured to
do my duty, and to make my peace
with God. I leave the re&s;t to Heaven.</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="47">
The&s;e are the reflections which <HI>to the up|right
make light ari&s;e in darkne&s;s;</HI> reflec|tions,
which clear the lonely hou&s;e of vir|tuous
poverty, and attend the con&s;cien|tious
&s;ufferer into pri&s;on or exile; which
&s;ooth the complaints of grief, lighten the
pre&s;&s;ure of old age, and furni&s;h to the
bed of &s;ickne&s;s a cordial of more grateful
reli&s;h, and more &s;overeign virtue, than
any which the world can afford.</P>
<P>Look abroad into life, and you will
find the general &s;en&s;e of mankind bearing
witne&s;s to this important truth, that mind
is &s;uperior to fortune; that what one feels
within, is of much greater importance
than all that befals him without. Let a
man be brought into &s;ome &s;uch &s;evere and
trying &s;ituation, as fixes the attention of
the public on his behaviour. The fir&s;t
que&s;tion which we put concerning him, is
not, What does he &s;uffer? but, How does
he bear it? Has he a quiet mind? or, Does
he appear to be unhappy within? If we
judge him to be compo&s;ed and firm, re|&s;igned
to Providence, and &s;upported by
<PB N="39" REF="48">
con&s;cious integrity, his character ri&s;es,
and his mi&s;ery le&s;&s;ens in our view. We
e&s;teem and admire, rather than pity him.
Recollect what holy men have endured
for the &s;ake of con&s;cience, and with what
chearfulne&s;s they have &s;uffered. On the
other hand, when con&s;cience has concur|red
with outward misfortunes in di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing
the guilty, think of the dreadful
con&s;equences which have en&s;ued. How
often, upon, a rever&s;e of fortune, after ab|u&s;ed
pro&s;perity, have they madly hurried
them&s;elves over that precipice from which
there is no return; and, in what nature
mo&s;t abhors, the voluntary extinction of
life, have &s;ought relief from that torment
of reflection, which was become too great
for them to bear?</P>
<P>Never then allow your&s;elves to imagine
that misfortunes alone form the chief mi|&s;ery
of man. None but the guilty are
completely mi&s;erable. The mi&s;giving and
di&s;tru&s;t, the accu&s;ations and reproaches of
their minds, the &s;en&s;e of having drawn
down upon their heads the evils which
<PB N="40" REF="49">
they &s;uffer and the terrifying expecta|tion
of more and wor&s;e evils to come;
the&s;e are the e&s;&s;ential ingredients of hu|man
mi&s;ery. They not only whet the
edge, but they envenom the darts of af|fliction,
and add poi&s;on to the wound.
Whereas, when misfortunes a&s;&s;ail a. good
man, they carry no &s;uch fatal auxiliaries
in their train. They may tear the &s;urface
of his &s;oul; but there is a &s;trength with|in,
which re&s;i&s;ts their farther impre&s;&s;ion.
The con&s;titution. of his mind is found.
The world can inflict upon it no wounds,
but what admit of cure.</P>
<P>III. ILL men in the time of trouble can
look up to no Protector, while good men
commit them&s;elves, with tru&s;t and hope,
to the care of Heaven. The human mind,
naturally feeble, is made to feel all its
weakne&s;s by the pre&s;&s;ure of adver&s;ity.
Dejected with evils which overpower its
&s;trength, it relies no longer on it&s;elf. It
ca&s;ts every where around a wi&s;hing ex|ploring
eye, for &s;ome &s;helter to &s;creen,
<PB N="41" REF="50">
&s;ome power to uphold it; and if, when
abandoned by the world, it can find no|thing
to which it may fly in the room of
the world, its &s;tate is truly forlorn. Now,
whither &s;hould the ungodly, in this &s;itua|tion,
turn for aid? After having contend|ed
with the &s;torms of adver&s;e fortune till
their &s;pirits are exhau&s;ted, gladly would
they retreat at la&s;t to the &s;anctuary of re|ligion.
But that &s;anctuary is &s;hut again&s;t
them; nay, it is environed with terrors.
They behold there, $word$ a Protector to
whom they can fly, but a Judge whom
they dread; and in tho&s;e moments when
they need his friend&s;hip the mo&s;t, they
are reduced to deprecate his wrath. If he
once <HI>called when they refu&s;edy and &s;tretch|ed
out his hands when they would not re|gard,</HI>
how much rea&s;on have they to fear,
that he will leave them now to <HI>eat the
fruit of their own ways, and to be filled with
their own devices;</HI> that he will <HI>laugh at
their calamity, and mock when their fear cometh?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="51">
But of all the thoughts which can enter
into the mind, in the &s;ea&s;on of di&s;tre&s;s,
the belief of an intere&s;t in his favour
who rules the world is the mo&s;t &s;oothing.
Every form of religion has afforded to
virtuous men &s;ome degree of this con&s;o|lation.
But it was re&s;erved for the Chri|&s;tian
revelation to carry it to its highe&s;t
point. For it is the direct &s;cope of that
revelation, to accommodate it&s;elf to the
circum&s;tances of man, under two main
views; as guilty in the &s;ight of God, and
as &s;truggling with the evils of the world.
Under the former, it di&s;covers to him a
Mediator and an atonement; under the
latter, it promi&s;es him the Spirit of grace
and con&s;olation. It is a &s;y&s;tem of com|plete
relief, extending from our &s;piritual
to our temporal di&s;tre&s;&s;es. The &s;ame hand
which holds out forgivene&s;s to the peni|tent,
and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the frail, di&s;pen&s;es
comfort and hope to the afflicted.</P>
<P>It de&s;ervcs your particular notice, in
this view, that there is no character which
God more frequently a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf
<PB N="43" REF="52">
in the &s;acred writings, than that of the pa|tron
of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. Compa&s;&s;ion is that
attribute of his nature which he has cho|&s;en
to place in the greate&s;t variety of
lights, on purpo&s;e that he might accom|modate
his maje&s;ty to our weakne&s;s, and
provide a cordial for human griefs. He
is the hearer of all prayers; but with par|ticular
attention he is repre&s;ented as li&s;t|ening
to the <HI>cry of the poor,</HI> and <HI>regard|ing
the prayer of the de&s;titute.</HI> All his crea|tures
he governs with ju&s;tice and wi&s;dom;
but he takes to him&s;elf, in a &s;pecial man|ner,
the charge of <HI>executing judgment for
the oppre&s;&s;ed,</HI> of <HI>protecting the &s;tranger,</HI> of
<HI>delivering him who hath no helper from the hand of the
&s;poiler. For the oppre&s;&s;ion of the
poor, and for the &s;ighing of the needy, will I
ari&s;e, &s;aith the Lord, to &s;et him in &s;a&s;ety from
him that puffeth at him. He is the Father
of the fatherle&s;s, and the Judge of the wi|dow
in his holy habitation. He rai&s;eth up
them that are bowed down. He dwelleth
with the contrite. He healeth the broken in
heart. For he knoweth our frame; he re|membereth
<PB N="44" REF="53">
that we are duft</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. ix. 8.&mdash;cii. 17.&mdash;cxlvi. 7.&mdash;lxviii. 5.&mdash;cxlvii. 3. ciii. 14.&mdash;&amp;$c.</NOTE>.&mdash;If the
wi&s;dom of his providence &s;aw it nece&s;&s;ary
to place &s;o many of his creatures in an
afflicted &s;tate, that &s;tate, however, he com|mi&s;erates.
He di&s;dains not to point out
him&s;elf as the refuge of the virtuous and
pious; and to invite them, amid&s;t all their
troubles, to pour out their hearts before
him. Tho&s;e circum&s;tances which e&s;trange
others from them, intere&s;t him the more
in their &s;ituation. The neglect or &s;corn
of the world expo&s;e them not to any con|tempt
in his &s;ight. No ob&s;curity conceals
them from his notice; and though they
&s;hould be forgotten by every friend on
earth, they are remembered by the God
of heaven. That &s;igh, heaved from the
afflicted bo&s;om, which is heard by no hu|man
ear, is li&s;tened to by him; and that
tear is remarked, which falls unnoticed
or de&s;pi&s;ed by the world.</P>
<P>Such views of the Supreme Being im|part
the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible con&s;olation to every
<PB N="45" REF="54">
pious heart. They pre&s;ent his admini&s;tra|tion
under an a&s;pect &s;o mild and benign,
as in a great mea&s;ure to di&s;per&s;e the gloom
which hangs over human life. A good
man acts with a vigour, and &s;uffers with
a patience more than human, when he
believes him&s;elf countenanced by the
Almighty. Injured or oppre&s;&s;ed by the
world, he looks up to a Judge who
will vindicate his cau&s;e; he appeals to a
Witne&s;s who knows his integrity; he
commits him&s;elf to a Friend who will never
for&s;ake him. When tired with the vexa|tions
of life, devotion opens to him its
quiet retreat, where the tumults of the
world are hu&s;hed, and its cares are lo&s;t in
happy oblivion; where <HI>the wicked cea&s;e
from troubling, and the weary are at re&s;t.</HI>
There his mind regains its &s;erenity; the
agitation of pa&s;&s;ion is calmed; and a &s;oft|ening
balm is infu&s;ed into the wounds of
the &s;pirit. Di&s;clo&s;ing to an invi&s;ible Friend
tho&s;e &s;ecret griefs which he has no encou|ragement
to make known to the world, his
heart is lightened. He docs not feel him|&s;elf
<PB N="46" REF="55">
&s;elf &s;olitary or for&s;aken. He believes God
to be pre&s;ent with him, and the Holy
Gho&s;t to be the in&s;pirer of his con&s;olati|ons.
From that <HI>&s;ecret place of the divine
tabernacle,</HI> into which the Text repre&s;ents
him as admitted, he hears this voice i&s;&s;ue,
<HI>Call upon me in the day of trouble and I will
an&s;wer thee. Fear not; for I am with thee.
Be not di&s;mayed; for I am thy God.</HI>
And as He hears a voice which &s;peaks to none but
the pure in heart, &s;o he beholds a hand
which &s;inners cannot &s;ee. He beholds the
hand of Providence conducting all the
hidden &s;prings and movements of the uni|ver&s;e;
and with a &s;ecret, but unerring ope|ration,
directing every event towards the
happine&s;s of the righteous. Tho&s;e afflicti|ons
which appear to others the me&s;&s;engers
of the wrath of Heaven, appear to him the
mini&s;ters of &s;anctification and wi&s;dom.
Where they di&s;cern nothing but the hor|rors
of the tempe&s;t which &s;urrounds them,
his more enlightened eye beholds the an|gel
who rides in the whirlwind, and di|rects
the &s;torm. Hence a <HI>peace keeping the
<PB N="47" REF="56">
mind and heart,</HI> which is no where to be
found but under <HI>the pavilion of the Al|mighty.</HI></P>
<P>IV. God men are comforted under
their troubles by the hope of heaven; while
bad men are not only deprived of this hope,
but di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with fears ari&s;ing from a fu|ture
&s;tate. The &s;oul of man can never di|ve&s;t
it&s;elf wholly of anxiety about its fate
hereafter. There are hours when even to
the pro&s;perous, in the mid&s;t of their plea|&s;ures,
eternity is an awful thought. But
much more when tho&s;e plea&s;ures, one after
another, begin to withdraw; when life al|ters
its form, and becomes dark and chear|le&s;s;
when its changes warn the mo&s;t in|con&s;iderate,
that what is &s;o mutable will
&s;oon pa&s;s entirely away; then, with pun|gent
earne&s;tne&s;s comes home that que&s;tion
to the heart, Into what world are we next
to go?&mdash;How mi&s;erable the man, who, un|der
the di&s;tractions of calamity, hangs
doubtful about an event which &s;o nearly
concerns him; who, in the mid&s;t of doubts
<PB N="48" REF="57">
and anxieties, approaching to that awful
boundary which &s;eparates this world from
the next, &s;hudders at the dark pro&s;pect
before him; wi&s;hing to exi&s;t after death,
and yet afraid of that exi&s;tence; catching
at every feeble hope which &s;uper&s;tition can
afford him, and trembling, in the &s;ame
moment, from reflection upon his crimes!</P>
<P>But ble&s;&s;ed be God who hath <HI>brought
life and immortality to light;</HI> who hath not
only brought them to light, but &s;ecured
them to good men; and by the death and
re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, hath <HI>begot|ten
them into the lively hope of an inheri|tance
incorruptible undefiled and that fadeth
not away.</HI> Ju&s;tly is this hope &s;tiled in
&s;cripture the <HI>anchor of the &s;oul, both &s;ure and &s;tedfa&s;t.</HI> For what an anchor is to a &s;hip
in a dark night, on an unknown coa&s;t, and
amid&s;t a boi&s;terous ocean, that is this hope
to the &s;oul when di&s;tracted by the confu|&s;ions
of the world. In the mid&s;t of dan|ger,
it gives &s;ecurity; in the mid&s;t of gene|ral
fluctuation, it affords one fixed point
of re&s;t. It is indeed the mo&s;t eminent of
<PB N="49" REF="58">
all the advantages which religion now
confers. For, con&s;ider the mighty power of
hope over the human mind. It is the uni|ver&s;al
comforter. It is the &s;pring of all hu|man
activity. Upon futurity, men are con|&s;tantly
fu&s;pended. From the pro&s;pect of
&s;ome future good, they toil and &s;uffer
through the whole cour&s;e of life; and it
is not &s;o much what they are at pre&s;ent,
as what they hope to be in &s;ome after
time, that enlivens their motions; fixes
attention, and &s;timulates indu&s;try. Now,
if in the common affairs of life &s;uch is the
energy of hope, even when its object is
neither very con&s;iderable, nor very cer|tain;
what effects may it not be expected
to produce, when it re&s;ts upon an object
&s;o &s;plendid, as a life of immortal felicity?
Were this hope entertained -with that full
per&s;ua&s;ion which Chri&s;tian faith demands,
it would, in truth, not merely alleviate,
but totally annihilate, all human mi&s;eries.
It would bani&s;h di&s;content, extingui&s;h
grief, and &s;u&s;pend the very feeling of pain.</P>
<P>But allowing for the mixture of human
frailty; admitting tho&s;e abatements which
<PB N="50" REF="59">
our imperfection makes upon the effect of
every religious principle, &s;till you will find,
that In proportion to the degree in which
the hope of Heaven operates upon good
men, they will be tranquil under &s;uffer|ings;
nay, they will be happy, in com|pari&s;on
of tho&s;e who enjoy no &s;uch relief.
What indeed, in the cour&s;e of human af|fairs,
is &s;ufficient to di&s;tre&s;s, far le&s;s to over|whelm
the mind of that man, who can look
down on all human things from an eleva|tion
&s;o much above them? He is only a
pa&s;&s;enger through this world. He is travel|ling
to a happier country. How di&s;agree|able
&s;oever the occurrences of his journey
may be, yet, at every &s;tage of that jour|ney,
he receives the a&s;&s;urance that he is
drawing nearer and nearer to the period of
re&s;t and felicity.&mdash;Endure, and thou &s;halt
overcome. Per&s;evere, and thou &s;halt be
&s;ucce&s;sful. The time of trial ha&s;tens to a
clo&s;e. Thy man&s;ion is prepared above;
thy re&s;t remaineth among the people of
God. The di&s;orders which vice has intro|duced
into the works of God, are about to
<PB N="51" REF="60">
terminate; and all tears are &s;oon to be
wiped away from the eyes of the ju&s;t.&mdash;
The firm a&s;&s;urance of this happy conclu|&s;ion
to the vexations and the vanities of
life, works a greater effect on the &s;incere
illiterate Chri&s;tian, than all the refinements
of philo&s;ophy can work on the mo&s;t learned
infidel. The&s;e may gratify the mind that
is at ea&s;e; may &s;ooth the heart when only
di&s;compo&s;ed in a &s;light degree; but when
it is &s;ore and deeply torn, when bereaved
of its be&s;t and mo&s;t beloved comforts, the
only con&s;olations that can then find acce&s;s,
ari&s;e from the hope of a better world; where
tho&s;e comforts &s;hall be again re&s;tored; and
all the virtuous &s;hall be a&s;&s;embled, in the
pre&s;ence of him who made them. Such
hopes bani&s;h that black melancholy which
overwhelms, and leave only that tender
melancholy which &s;oftens the heart, and
often renders the whole character more
gentle and amiable.</P>
<P>Of this nature are the re&s;ources which
religion provides for good men. By its
<PB N="52" REF="61">
previous di&s;cipline, it trains them to forti|trude;
by the reflections of a good con&s;ci|ence
it &s;ooths, by the &s;en&s;e of divine fa|vour
it &s;upports them; and when every
comfort fails them on earth, it chears them
with the hope of heaven. Di&s;tingui&s;hing
his &s;ervants with &s;uch advantages, God is
ju&s;tly &s;aid to erect <HI>his pavilion</HI> over them
in the evil time. He not only <HI>&s;preads a tent
for them in the wilderne&s;s,</HI> but he tran&s;\forms
in &s;ome mea&s;ure the &s;tate of nature
around them. To u&s;e the beautiful lan|guage
of antient prophecy; <HI>In the de&s;art,
the thir&s;ty land, where no water is, he opens
&s;prings. In&s;tead of the thorn he makes the
fir-tree to come up; in&s;tead of the briar, the
myrtle to &s;pring. In mid&s;t of the habita&s;|tion
of dragons, he makes green pa&s;tures ri&s;e,
and &s;till waters flow around his people.</HI></P>
<P>THE improvement to be made of the&s;e
truths is as obvious, as it is important.
Let us &s;tudy &s;o to conduct our lives, that
we may be qualified for deriving &s;uch
con&s;olations from religion. To their rea|lity,
<PB N="53" REF="62">
and their importance, all mankind
bear witne&s;s. For no &s;ooner are they
overtaken by di&s;tre&s;s, than to religion
they all fly. This, throughout every age,
has been the univer&s;al &s;helter which the
young and the old, the high and the low,
the giddy and the &s;erious, have &s;ought to
gain, as &s;oon as they found that re&s;t could
be no where el&s;e procured for the weary
head, or the aching heart. But amid&s;t
tho&s;e multitudes that croud to religion for
relief, how few are entitled to approach
that &s;acred &s;ource of comfort? On what
feeble props do their hopes and preten&s;ions
re&s;t? How much &s;uper&s;tition mingles
with that religion to which men are driven
by di&s;tre&s;s and fear?&mdash;You mu&s;t fir&s;t ap|ply
to it as the guide of life, before you
can have recour&s;e to it as the refuge of
&s;orrow. You mu&s;t &s;ubmit to its legi&s;lative
authority, and experience its renewing
influence, before you can look for its con|&s;olatory
effect. You mu&s;t &s;ecure the te|&s;timony
of a good con&s;cience, and peace
with God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; otherwi&s;e,
<PB N="54" REF="63">
<HI>when the floods &s;hall come, and the rains de|&s;cend,
and the winds blow,</HI> the hou&s;e which
you had propo&s;ed for your retreat, &s;hall
prove the <HI>bou&s;e &s;ounded on the &s;and, not on
the rock.</HI></P>
<P>There are two plans, and there are but
two, on which any man can propo&s;e to
conduct him&s;elf through the dangers and
di&s;tre&s;&s;es of human life. The one is the plan
of worldly wi&s;dom; the other, that of de|termined
adherence to con&s;cience. He who
acts upon the former, lays principle a&s;ide,
and tru&s;ts his defence to his art and abi|lity.
Me avails him&s;elf of every advantage
which his knowledge of the world &s;ug|ge&s;ts.
He attends to nothing but what he
con&s;iders as his intere&s;t, and, unconfined
by con&s;cience, pur&s;ues it by every cour&s;e
which promi&s;es him &s;ucce&s;s. This plan,
though too often adopted, will be found, on
trial, ineffectual and deceitful. For human
ability is an unequal match for the violent
and unfore&s;een vici&s;&s;itudes of the world.
When the&s;e torrents ri&s;e in their might,
they &s;weep away in a moment the banks
<PB N="55" REF="64">
which worldly wi&s;dom had reared for de|fence,
and overwhelm alike the crafty and
the artle&s;s. In the mean time, per&s;ons of
this character condemn them&s;elves to live
a mo&s;t unquiet life. They pa&s;s their days
in perpetual anxiety, li&s;tening to every
motion; &s;tartled by every alarm; chan|ging
their mea&s;ures on every new occur|rence;
and when, di&s;tre&s;s breaks in over
all their defences, they arc left under it,
hopele&s;s and di&s;con&s;olate.</P>
<P>The plan which, in oppo&s;ition to this,
religion recommends, as both more ho|nourable
in it&s;elf, and more effectual for
&s;ecurity, is, at all hazards, to do your
duty, and to leave the con&s;equcnces to
God. Let him. who would act upon this
plan, adopt for the rule of his conduct,
that maxim of the P&s;almi&s;t's, <HI>Tru&s;t in the
Lord, and do good</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxxvii. 3.</NOTE>. To firm integrity, let
him join a humble reliance on God. Let
his adherence to duty, encourage his reli|gious
tru&s;t. Let his religious tru&s;t, in&s;pire
him with fortitude in the performance of
his duty. Let him know no path but the
<PB N="56" REF="65">
&s;traight and direct one. In the mo&s;t cri|tical
moments of action, let him a&s;k no
further que&s;tions, than, What is the right,
the fit, the worthy part? How as a man,
and as a Chri&s;tian, it becomes him to act?
Having received the deci&s;ion of con&s;cience,
let him <HI>commit his way unto the Lord.</HI> Let
him, without trepidation or wavering,
proceed in di&s;charging his duty; re&s;olved,
that though the world may make him
unfortunate, it &s;hall never make him
ba&s;e; and confiding, that in what God
and his con&s;cience require him to act or
&s;uffer, God and a good con&s;cience will &s;up|port
him.&mdash;Such principles as the&s;e, are
the be&s;t preparation for the vici&s;&s;itudes of
the human lot. They are the &s;hield of
inward peace. He who thinks and acts
thus, &s;hall be expo&s;ed to no wounds but
what religion can cure. He may feel the
blows of adver&s;ity; but &s;hall not know
the wounds of the heart.</P>

<P>THE happy influence of religion
upon human life, in the time of ad|ver&s;ity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. III.</NOTE>
has been con&s;idered, in the pre|ceding
di&s;cour&s;e. Concerning this the
&s;entiments of men are more generally
agreed, than with re&s;pect to &s;ome other
prerogatives which religion claims. They
very readily a&s;&s;ign to it the office of a
Comforter. But as long as their &s;tate is
pro&s;perous, they are apt to account it an
unnece&s;&s;ary gue&s;t, perhaps an unwelcome
<PB N="58" REF="67">
intruder. Let us not be thus unju&s;t to
religion, nor confine its importance to
one period only in the life of man. It
was never intended to be merely the nur&s;e
of &s;ickne&s;s, and the &s;taff of old age. I
purpo&s;e now to &s;how you, That it is no
le&s;s e&s;&s;ential to the enjoyment of pro&s;pe|rity,
than to the comfort of adver&s;ity:
That pro&s;perity is pro&s;perous, if we may
be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, to a good man
only; and that to every other per&s;on, it
will prove, notwith&s;tanding its fair ap|pearance,
a barren and joyle&s;s &s;tate.
The P&s;almi&s;t, in the Text, by an image
taken from one of the mo&s;t beautiful ob|jects
in nature, de&s;cribes a man who
flouri&s;hes in full pro&s;perity. But to whom
is the de&s;cription limited? To him, as the
preceding ver&s;es inform us, <HI>that walketh
not in the coun&s;el of the ungodly, nor &s;tandeth
in the way of &s;inners nor &s;itteth in the &s;eat
of the &s;cornful but hath his delight in the
law of God,</HI> He only is <HI>like the tree plant|ed
by the rivers of water;</HI> whil&s;t <HI>the un|godly</HI>
as he adds, <HI>are not &s;o;</HI> but how
<PB N="59" REF="68">
pro&s;perous &s;oever they may appear to the
world, are in truth but like <HI>the chaff which
the wind driveth away.</HI> In confirmation
of this doctrine, I &s;hall lay before you,
&s;ome of tho&s;e circum&s;tances which di&s;tin|gui&s;h
the pro&s;perity of the good man be|yond
that of the &s;inner; and &s;hall con|clude,
with pointing out the dangers and
mi&s;eries, into which the latter is apt to be
betrayed, by his favourable &s;ituation in
the world.
I. PIETY, and gratitude to God, con|tribute
in a high degree to enliven pro&s;|perity.
Gratitude is a plea&s;ing emotion.
The &s;en&s;e of being di&s;tingui&s;hed by the
kindne&s;s of another, gladdens the heart,
warms it with reciprocal affection, and
gives to any po&s;e&s;&s;ion which is agreeable
in it&s;elf, a double reli&s;h, from its being
the gift of a friend. Favours conferred
by men, I acknowledge, may prove bur|den&s;ome.
For human virtue is never per|fect;
and &s;ometimes unrea&s;onable expec|tations
on the one &s;ide, &s;ometimes a mor|tifying
<PB N="60" REF="69">
&s;en&s;e of dependence on the other,
corrode in &s;ecret the plea&s;ure of benefits,
and convert the obligations of friend&s;hip
into grounds of jealou&s;y. But nothing of
this kind can affect the intercour&s;e of gra|titude
with Heaven. Its favours are
wholly di&s;intere&s;ted; and with a grati|tude
the mo&s;t cordial and un&s;u&s;picious,
a good man looks up to that Almighty
Benefactor, who aims at no end but the
happine&s;s of tho&s;e whom he ble&s;&s;es, and
who de&s;ires no return from them, but
a devout and thankful heart. While
others can trace their pro&s;perity to no
higher &s;ource than a &s;eries of worldly
cau&s;es, and, often, of mean or tri&s;ling in|cidents,
which occa&s;ionally favoured their
de&s;igns; with what &s;uperior &s;atisfaction
does the &s;ervant of God remark the hand
of that gracious Power which hath rai&s;ed
him up; which hath happily conducted
him through the various &s;teps of life, and
crowned him with the mo&s;t favourable
di&s;tinction beyond his equals?
<PB N="61" REF="70">
Let us farther con&s;ider, that not only
gratitude for the pa&s;t, but a chearing
&s;en&s;e of God's favour at the pre&s;ent, en|ters
into the pious emotion. They are
only the virtuous, who in their pro&s;per|ous
days hear this voice addre&s;&s;ed to
them: <HI>Go thy way eat thy bread with joy,
and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for
God now accepteth thy works.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">ECCLEF. IX. 7.</NOTE> He who
is the Author of their pro&s;perity, gives
them a title to enjoy, with complacency,
his own gift. While bad men &s;natch the
plca&s;ures of the world as by &s;tealth, with|out
countenance from God. the proprietor
of the world, the righteous fit openly
down to the fea&s;t of life, under the &s;mile
of approving Heaven. No guilty fears
damp their joys. The ble&s;&s;ing of God
re&s;ts upon all that they po&s;&s;e&s;s; his pro|tection
&s;urrounds them; and hence, <HI>in the
habitations of the righteous is found the
voice of rejoicing and &s;alvation.</HI> A lu&s;tre
unknown to others, inve&s;ts, in their &s;ight,
the whole face of nature. Their piety re|flect
<PB N="62" REF="71">
a &s;un-&s;hine from heaven upon the
pro&s;perity of the world; unites in one
point of view, the &s;miling a&s;pect both of
the powers above, and of the objects be|low.
Not only have they as full a reli&s;h
as others, of the innocent plea&s;ures of
life, but, moreover, in the&s;e they hold
communion with God. In all that is
good or fair, they trace his hand. From
the beauties of nature, from the improve|ments
of art, from the enjoyments of &s;o|cial
life, they rai&s;e their affection to the
&s;ource of all the happine&s;s which &s;ur|rounds
them; and thus widen the &s;phere
of their plea&s;ures, by adding intellectual,
and &s;piritual, to earthly joys.</P>
<P>For illu&s;tration of what I have &s;aid on
this head, remark that chearful enjoy|ment
of a pro&s;perous &s;tate which King
David had, when he wrote the twenty-third
P&s;alm; and venture, if you can, to
compare the highe&s;t plea&s;ures of the
riotous &s;inner, with the happy and &s;ati&s;|fied
&s;pirit which breathes throughout that
P&s;alm.&mdash;In the mid&s;t of the &s;plendour of
<PB N="63" REF="72">
royalty, with what amiable &s;implicity of
gratitude does he look up to the Lord
as <HI>his Shepherd;</HI> happier in a&s;cribing all
his &s;ucce&s;s to divine favour, than to the
policy of his coun&s;els, or to the force of
his arms! How many in&s;tances of divine
goodne&s;s aro&s;e before him, in plea&s;ing re|membrance,
when with &s;uch reli&s;h he
&s;peaks of the <HI>green pa&s;tures and &s;till waters
be&s;ide which God had led him, of his cup
which he had made to overflow,</HI> and of <HI>the
table which he had prepared for him in
pre&s;ence of his enemies!</HI> With what perfect
tranquillity does he look forward to the
time of his pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>the valley of
the &s;hadow of death;</HI> unappalled by that
Spectre, who&s;e mo&s;t di&s;tant appearance
bla&s;ts the pro&s;perity of &s;inners! He fears
no evil, as long as <HI>the rod and the &s;taff</HI> of
his Divine Shepherd are with him; and
through all the unknown periods of this,
and of a future exi&s;tence, commits him|&s;elf
to his guidance with &s;ecure and tri|umphant
hope. <HI>Surely goodne&s;e and mercy
&s;hall follow me all the days of my life; and
<PB N="64" REF="73">
I will dwell in the hou&s;e of the Lord for
ever</HI>&mdash;What a purified, &s;entimental en|joyment
of pro&s;perity, is here exhibited!.
How different from that gro&s;s reli&s;h of
worldly plea&s;ures, which belongs to tho&s;e
who behold only the terre&s;trial &s;ide of
things; who&s;e views ri&s;e no higher than
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of human contingencies,
and the weak efforts of human ability;
who have no protector or patron in the
heavens, to enliven their pro&s;perity, or
to warm their hearts with gratitude and
tru&s;t</P>
<P>II. RELIGION affords to good men a
peculiar &s;ecurity in the enjoyment of their
pro&s;perity. One of the fir&s;t reflections
which mu&s;t &s;trike every thinking man,
after his &s;ituation in the world has become
agreeable, is the in&s;tability of that &s;itua|tion.
From a variety of cau&s;es, he lies
open to change. On many &s;ides he &s;ees
that he may be pierced; and the wider
his comforts extend, the broader is the
mark which he &s;preads to the arrows of
<PB N="65" REF="74">
misfortune. Hence many a &s;ecret alarm
to the reflecting mind; and to tho&s;e who
reject all &s;uch alarms, the real danger in|crea&s;es,
in proportion to their improvi|dent
&s;ecurity.</P>
<P>By worldly a&s;&s;i&s;tance it is vain to think
of providing any effectual defence, &s;eeing
the world's mutability is the very cau&s;e
of our terror. It is from a higher prin|ciple,
from a power &s;uperior to the world,
that relief mu&s;t be &s;ought, amid&s;t &s;uch
di&s;quietudes of the heart. He who in
his pro&s;perity can look up to One who is
witne&s;s to his moderation, humanity, and
charity he who can appeal to Heaven,
that he has not been elated by pride, nor
overcome by plea&s;ure, but has &s;tudied to
employ its gifts to the honour of the giver;
this man, if there be any truth in reli|gion,
if there be any benignity or good|ne&s;s
in the admini&s;tration of the univer&s;e,
has &s;omewhat to re&s;t upon for &s;ecurity
and hope. Not that an intere&s;t in God's
grace will perpetuate to a goood man,
more than to others, a life of unruffled
<PB N="66" REF="75">
pro&s;perity. Change and alteration form
the very e&s;&s;ence of the world. But let the
world change around him at plea&s;ure, he
has ground to hope that it &s;hall not be able
to make him unhappy. Whatever may
change, God's providence is &s;till the &s;ame;
and his love to the righteous remains un|altered.
If it &s;hall be the divine will to
remove one comfort, he tru&s;ts that &s;ome
other &s;hall be given. Whatever is given,
whatever is taken away, he confides, that
in the la&s;t re&s;ult, all <HI>&s;hall work for his
good.</HI></P>
<P>Hence, he is not difturbed, like bad
men, by the in&s;tability of the world. Dan|gers,
which overcome others, &s;hake not his
more &s;teady mind. He enjoys the plea&s;ures
of life pure and unallayed, becau&s;e he en|joys
them, as long as they la&s;t, without
anxious terrors. They are not his all, his
only good. He welcomes them, when they
arrive; and when they pa&s;s away, he can
eye them, as they depart, without agony
or de&s;pair. His pro&s;perity &s;trikes a deep|er
and firmer root than that of the un|godly.
<PB N="67" REF="76">
And for this rea&s;on he is com|pared,
in the Text, to a <HI>tree planted by the
rivers of water;</HI> a tree, who&s;e branches
the tempe&s;t may indeed bend, but who&s;e
roots it cannot touch; a tree, which may
occa&s;ionally be &s;tripped of its leaves and
blo&s;&s;oms, but which &s;till maintains its
place, and. in due &s;ea&s;on fiouri&s;hes anew.
Whereas the &s;inner, in his pro&s;perity, ac|cording
to the allu&s;ion in the book of Job,
re&s;embles <HI>the ru&s;h that groweth up in the
mire</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job vii. II.</NOTE>; a &s;lender reed, that may flouri&s;h
green for a while by the &s;ide of the
brook, as long as it is cheri&s;hed by the
&s;un, and fanned by the breeze; till the
fir&s;t bitter bla&s;t breaks its &s;eeble &s;tem, roots
it out from its bed, and lays it in the
du&s;t. Lo! &s;uch is the pro&s;perity <HI>of them
that forget God; and thus their hope &s;hall
peri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>III. RELIGION forms GOod men to the
mo&s;t proper temper for the enjoyment of
pro&s;perity. A little reflection may &s;atisfy
<PB N="68" REF="77">
us, that mere po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, even granting it
to be &s;ecure, does not con&s;titute enjoy|ment.
Give a man all that is in the
power of the world to be&s;tow &s;urround
him with riches; crown him with. ho|nours;
inve&s;t him, if you will, with, ab|&s;olute
dominion; but leave him at the
&s;ame time under &s;ome &s;ecret oppce&s;&s;ion or
heavine&s;s of heart; you be&s;tow indeed the
materials of enjoyment, but you deprive
him of ability to extract it. You &s;et a
fea&s;t before him, but he wants the power
of ta&s;ting it. Hence pro&s;perity is &s;o often
an equivocal ward, denoting merely af|fluence
of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but unju&s;tly applied
to the mi&s;erable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>We all know the effects which any
indi&s;po&s;ition of the body, even though
&s;light, produces on external pro&s;perity.
Vi&s;it the gaye&s;t and mo&s;t fortunate man
on earth, only with &s;leeple&s;s nights; di&s;|order
any &s;ingle organ of his &s;en&s;es; cor|rode
but one of his &s;malle&s;t nerves; and
you &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee all his gaiety va|ni&s;h
you &s;hall hear him complain, that
<PB N="69" REF="78">
he is a mi&s;erable creature, and. expre&s;s his
envy of the pea&s;ant and the cottager.&mdash;And
can you believe, that a di&s;ea&s;e in the
&s;oul is le&s;s fatal to enjoyment, than a
di&s;ea&s;e in the animal frame; or that a
&s;ound mind is not as e&s;&s;entiai, as a &s;ound
body to the pro&s;perity of man?&mdash;Let us
rate &s;en&s;nal gratifications as high as we
plea&s;e, we &s;hall be made to feel that the
&s;eat of enjoyment is in the &s;oul. The cor|rupted
temper, and the gui$ty pa&s;&s;ions of
the bad, frn&s;trate the effect of every ad|vantage
which the world confers on them.
The world may call them men of plea|&s;ure,
but of all others they are the great|e&s;t
foes to plea&s;ure. From tnieir eagerne&s;s
to gra&s;p, they &s;trangle and de&s;troy it.
None but the temperate, the regular, and
the virtuous, know how to enjoy pro&s;peri|ty.
They bring to its comforts the manly
reli&s;h of a &s;ound uncorrupted mind. They
&s;top at the proper point, before enjoy|ment
degenerates into di&s;gu&s;t, and plea|&s;ure
is converted into pain. They are
&s;trangers to tho&s;e complaints which flow
<PB N="70" REF="79">
from &s;pleen, caprice, and all the fanta&s;tical
di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a vitiated mind. While riot|ous
indulgence enervates both the body
and the mind, purity and virtue heighten
all the powers of human fruition. Mo|derate
and &s;imple plea&s;ures. reli&s;h high
with the temperate; In the mid&s;t of his
&s;tudied re&s;imements, the voluptuary lan|gui&s;hes</P>
<P>Wherever guilt mingles with pro&s;pe|rity,
a certain gloom and heavine&s;s enter
along with it. Vitious intrigues never
fail to entangle and embarra&s;s tho&s;e who
engage in them. But innocence confers
ea&s;e and freedom on the mind; leaves it
open to every plea&s;ing &s;en&s;ation; gives a
lightne&s;s to the &s;pirits, &s;imilar to the na|tive
gaiety of youth and health; ill imi|tated,
and ill &s;upplied by that forced le|vity
of the vitious, which aii&s;es not from
the health, but from the drunkenne&s;s of
the mind.</P>
<P>Feeble are all plea&s;ures in. which, the
heart has no part. The &s;elfi&s;h gratifica|tions
of the bad, are both narrow in their
<PB N="71" REF="80">
circle, and &s;hort in their duration. But
pro&s;perity is redoubled, to a good man, by
his generous u&s;e of it. It is reflected back
upon him from every one whom he makes
happy. In the intercour&s;e of dome&s;tic af|fection,
in the attachment of friends, the
gratitude of dependents, the e&s;teem and
good will of all who know him, he &s;ees
ble&s;&s;ings multiplied round him on every
&s;ide. <HI>When, the ear beard me then it ble&s;&s;ed
me; and when the eye &s;aw me it gave wit|ne&s;s
to me. Becau&s;e I delivered the poor that
cried the fatherle&s;s and him that had none
to help him. The ble&s;&s;ing of him that was
ready to peri&s;h came upon me, and I cau&s;ed
the widow's heart to &s;ing for joy. I was
eyes to the blind and feet was I to the lame:
I was a father to the poor; and the cau&s;e
which I knew not, I &s;earched out</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job xxix. II,&mdash;17.</NOTE>&mdash;<HI>Thus,
whil&s;t the righteous fiouri&s;heth like a tree
planted by the rivers of water he bring|eth
forth al&s;o his fruit in his &s;ea&s;on:</HI> And
that fruit, to pur&s;ue the allu&s;ion of the
Text, he brings forth not for him&s;elf
alone. He flouri&s;hes, not like a tree in
<PB N="72" REF="81">
&s;ome &s;olitary de&s;art, which &s;catters its
blo&s;&s;oms to the wind, and communicates
neither fruit nor &s;hade to any living
thing: But like a tree in the mid&s;t of an
inhabited country, which to &s;ome affords
friendly &s;helter, to others, fruit; which
is not only admired by all for its beauty,
but ble&s;&s;ed by the traveller for the &s;hade,
and by the hungry for the &s;u&s;tenance it
hath given.</P>
<P>IV. RELIGION heightens the pro&s;perity
of good men, by the pro&s;pect which it af|fords
them of greater happine&s;s to come
in another world. I &s;howed, in the fore|going
di&s;cour&s;e, the mighty effect of the
hope of heaven, in relieving the mind un|der
the troubles of life. And &s;ure, if this
hope be able to &s;upport the falling, it
cannot but improve the flouri&s;hing &s;tate
of man; if it can di&s;pel the thicke&s;t
gloom of adver&s;ity, it mu&s;t needs enliven
pro&s;perity by the additional lu&s;tre which
it throws upon it. What is pre&s;ent, is
never &s;ufficient to give us full &s;atifaction.
<PB N="73" REF="82">
To the pre&s;ent we mu&s;t always join &s;ome
agreeable anticipations of futurity, in or|der
to complete our plea&s;ure. What an
acce&s;&s;ion then mu&s;t the pro&s;perity of the
righteous man receive, when born with
a &s;mooth and gentle gale along the cur|rent
of life, and looking round on all the
ble&s;&s;ings of his &s;tate, he can con&s;ider the&s;e
as no more than an introduction to higher
&s;cenes which are hereafter to open; he
can view his pre&s;ent life, as only the
porch through which he is to pa&s;s into
the palace of bli&s;s; and his pre&s;ent joys,
as but a feeble &s;tream, di&s;pen&s;ed for his
occa&s;ional refre&s;hment, until he arrive at
that river of life, which flows at God's
right hand?&mdash;Such pro&s;pects purify the
mind, at the &s;ame time that they gladden
it. They prevent a good man from &s;et|ting
too high a value on his pre&s;ent po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions;
and thereby a&s;&s;i&s;t him in main|taining,
amid&s;t the temptations of worldly
plea&s;ure, that command of him&s;elf which
is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the wi&s;e and temperate
enjoyment of pro&s;perity.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="83">
It is the fate of all human plea&s;ures,
by continuance, to fade; of mo&s;t of them,
to cloy. Hence, in the mo&s;t pro&s;perous
&s;tate, there are frequent intervals of lan|guor,
and even of dejection. There are
vacuities in the happie&s;t life, which it is
not in the power of the world to fill up.
What relief &s;o adapted to tho&s;e vacant or
dejected periods, as the plea&s;ing hopes
which ari&s;e from immortality? How bar|ren
and imperfect that pro&s;perity, which
can have recour&s;e to no &s;uch &s;ub&s;idiary
comfort, in order to animate the &s;tagna|tion
of vulgar life, and to &s;upply the in|&s;ufficiency
of worldly plea&s;ures!</P>
<P>Worldly pro&s;perity declines with de|clining
life. In youth, its reli&s;h was
bri&s;k and poignant. It becomes more
&s;ober as life advances; and flattens as life
de&s;cends. He who lately overflowed with
gay &s;pirits and high hopes, begins to
look back with heavine&s;s on the days of
former years. He thinks of his old com|panions
who are gone; and reviews pa&s;t
&s;cenes more agreeable than any which are
<PB N="75" REF="84">
likely to return. The activity of pur&s;uit
is weakened. The vivacity of amu&s;ement
is &s;pent. The gratifications of &s;en&s;e lan|gui&s;h.
When his accu&s;tomed plea&s;ures,
one $word$ another, thus &s;teal treacherou&s;ly
away, what can he, who is an utter &s;tran|ger
to religion, and to the hope of Heaven,
&s;ub&s;titute in their place?&mdash;But even in
in that drooping period, the promi&s;es and
hopes of religion &s;upport the &s;pirits of a
good man till the late&s;t hour. <HI>His leaf,</HI>
it is &s;aid in the Text, <HI>&s;hall not wither.</HI>
It &s;hall not be in the power of time to
bla&s;t his pro&s;perity. But old age &s;hall re|ceive
him into a quiet retreat, where, if
vivid &s;en&s;ations fail, $word$ plea&s;ures re|main
to &s;ooth him. That hope of im|mortality,
which before improved his other
enjoyments, now in a great mea&s;ure &s;up|plies
their ab&s;ence. Its importance ri&s;es,
in proportion as its object draws near.
He is not for&s;aken by the world, but re|tires
from it with dignity; reviewing
with a $word$ mind the part which he has
acted, and tru&s;ting to the promi&s;e of God,
<PB N="76" REF="85">
for an approaching reward. Such pro&s;|pects
&s;hed a plea&s;ing tranquillity over the
old age of the righteous man. They make
the evening of his days go down uncloud|ed;
and allow the &s;tream of life, though
waxing low, to run clear to the la&s;t drop.</P>
<P>THUS I have &s;hown, I hope, with full
evidence, what material ingredients re|ligion
and a good con&s;cience are in the
pro&s;perity of life. Separated from them,
pro&s;perity, how fair &s;oever it may &s;how
to the world, is in&s;ipid, nay, frequently
noxious to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: United with
them, it ri&s;es into a real ble&s;&s;ing be&s;towed
by God upon man. <HI>God giveth to a man
that is good in his &s;ight, wi&s;dom, and know|ledge,
and joy; but to the &s;inner he giveth
&s;ore travel, to gather, and to heap up, that
he may give to him that is good before
God</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. ii. 26.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALLOW me now to conclude the &s;ub|ject,
with repre&s;enting to the pro&s;perous
men of the world, tho&s;e crimes and mi|&s;eries
<PB N="77" REF="86">
into which the abu&s;e of their con|dition
is likely to betray them, and call|ing
upon them to beware of the dangers
with which they are threatened.</P>
<P>It is unfortunate for mankind, that tho&s;e
&s;ituations which favour plea&s;ure, are too
generally adver&s;e to virtue. Virtue re|quires
internal government and di&s;ci|pline;
pro&s;perity relaxes the mind, and
inflames the pa&s;&s;ions. Virtue is &s;upport|ed
by a regard to what is future; pro&s;pe|rity
attaches us wholly to what is pre&s;ent.
The characteri&s;tics of virtue, are mode&s;ty
and humility; the mo&s;t common attend|ants
of pro&s;perity, are pride and pre|&s;umption.
One &s;hould think, that pro&s;|perity
would prove the &s;tronge&s;t incite|ment
to remember and to honour that
God who be&s;tows it. Yet &s;uch is the
perver&s;en$s of human nature, that it
proves much oftener the motive to im|piety.
The changes of the world call the
attention of men to an Invi&s;ible Power.
But a train of events proceeding accord|ing
to their wi&s;h, leads them to nothing
<PB N="78" REF="87">
beyond what they &s;ee. The Supreme
Giver is concealed from view by his own
gifts. This in&s;tance of &s;ucce&s;s they a&s;cribe
to a fortunate concurrence of worldly
cau&s;es; that acqui&s;ition, to their own
&s;kill and indu&s;try; unmindful of him
who, from the beginning, arranged that
$eries of cau&s;es, and who placed them in
circum&s;tances where their indu&s;try could
operate with $ucce&s;s. From forgetting
God, they too often proceed to de&s;pi&s;e
him. All that is light or giddy in their
minds, is &s;et in motion by the gale of
pro&s;perity. Arrogance and &s;elf-&s;ufficiency
are lifted up; and their &s;tate is con&s;ider|ed,
as &s;ecured by their own &s;trength.
Hence that <HI>pride of countenance</HI> through
which the wicked in their pro&s;perity, as
David ob&s;erves, <HI>refu&s;e to &s;eek after God.</HI>
They are de&s;cribed as <HI>&s;peaking lo&s;tily, and
&s;etting their mouth again&s;t the Heavens.
They take the timbrel and $arp, and rejoice
at the &s;ound of the organ$ and they &s;ay unto
God, Depart from us, for we de$$re not the
knowledge of thy ways. What is the Al|mighty,
<PB N="79" REF="88">
that we &s;hould &s;erve him? Or
what profit &s;hould we have, if we pray un|to
him?</HI></P>
<P><HI>They &s;ay unto God, Depart from us.&mdash;</HI>
What an impious voice! Could we have
believed it po&s;&s;ible, that worldly plea&s;ures
&s;hould &s;o far intoxicate any human heart?
Wretched and infatuated men! Have you
ever con&s;idered on what your confidence
re&s;ts?&mdash;You have &s;aid in your hearts, <HI>You
&s;hall never be moved;</HI> you fancy your&s;elves
placed on a <HI>mountain which &s;tandeth &s;trong.</HI>
Awake from tho&s;e flattering dreams, and
behold how every thing totters around
you! You &s;tand on the edge of a preci|pice;
and the ground is &s;liding away be|low
your feet. In your health, life, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions,
connections, plea&s;ures, the &s;eeds
of change are &s;own; principles of de|&s;truction
work. The mine advances in
&s;ecret, which &s;aps the foundations, while
you revel on the &s;urface. No mighty ef|fort,
no long preparation of events, is
needed to overturn your pro&s;perity. By
&s;low degrees it ro&s;e. Long time, much
<PB N="80" REF="89">
labour, and the concurrence of many a&s;|&s;i&s;ting
cau&s;es, were nece&s;&s;ary to rear it up;
but one &s;light incident can reduce it to
nought. Su&s;picions are infu&s;ed into the
patron or the prince on whom you de|pend;
and your di&s;grace en&s;ues. Exer|ci&s;e,
or amu&s;ement, kindles a fever in
the veins of tho&s;e whom you loved; and
you are robbed of your comforts and
hopes. A few grains of &s;and lodge them|&s;elves
within you; and the re&s;t of your
life is di&s;ea&s;e and mi&s;ery. Ten thou&s;and
contingencies ever float on the current of
life, the &s;malle&s;t of which, if it meet
your frail bark in the pa&s;&s;ing, is &s;ufficient
to da&s;h it in pieces.&mdash;Is this a place, is
this a time, to &s;well with fancied &s;ecurity,
to riot in unlawful plea&s;ure, and, by
your di&s;regard of moral and religious du|ties,
to brave the government of the Al|mighty?
He hath &s;tamped every po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of man with this in&s;cription, <HI>Rejoice
with trembling.</HI> Throughout every age,
he hath pointed his peculiar di&s;plea&s;ure
again&s;t the confidence of pre&s;umption,
<PB N="81" REF="90">
and the arrogance of pro&s;perity. He hath
pronounced, that <HI>who&s;oever exalteth him|&s;elf
&s;hall be aba&s;ed.</HI> And &s;hall neither the
admonitions which you receive from the
vi&s;ible incon&s;tancy of the world, nor the
declarations of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure, be
&s;ufficient to check your thoughtle&s;s career?
Know, that by your impiety, you mul|tiply
the dangers which already threaten
you on every &s;ide; you accelerate the
&s;peed with which the changes of the world
advance to your de&s;truction. The Al|mighty
touches with his rod that edifice
of du&s;t, on which you &s;tand, and boa&s;t of
your &s;trength; and at that in&s;tant, it
crumbles to nothing.</P>
<P>As men then, bethink your&s;elves of hu|man
in&s;tability. As Chri&s;tians, reverence
the awful government of God. In&s;ure
your pro&s;perity, by con&s;ecrating it to
religion and virtue. Be humble in your
elevation; be moderate in your views;
be &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to him who hath rai&s;ed and
di&s;tingui&s;hed you. Forget not, that on
his providence you are as dependent, and
to the obedience of his laws as much
<PB N="82" REF="91">
bound, as the meane&s;t of your fellow|creatures.
Di&s;grace not your &s;tation, by
that gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of &s;en&s;uality, that levity of
di&s;&s;ipation, or that in&s;olence of rank, which
be&s;peak a little mind. Let the af$ability
of your behaviour, &s;how that you remem|ber
the natural equality of men. Let
your moderation in plea&s;ure, your com|mand
of pa&s;&s;ion, and your &s;teady regard
to the great duties of life, &s;how that you
po&s;&s;e&s;s a mind worthy of your fortune.
E&s;tabli&s;h your character on the ba&s;is of
e&s;teem; not on the flattery of dependents,
or the prai&s;e of &s;ycophants, but on the
re&s;pect of the wi&s;e and the good. Let in|nocence
pre&s;ide over your enjoyments. Let
u&s;efulne&s;s and beneficence, not o&s;tentation
and vanity, direct the train of your pur|&s;uits.
Let <HI>your alms, together with your
prayers, come up in memorial before God.</HI>
So &s;hall your pro&s;perity, under the ble&s;|&s;ing
of Heaven, be <HI>as the &s;hining light
which &s;hineth more and more unto the per|fect
day.</HI> So &s;hall it re&s;emble tho&s;e cele|&s;tial
fires which glow above with benefi|cent,
with regular, and permanent lu&s;tre;
<PB N="83" REF="92">
and not prove that <HI>mirth of fools,</HI> which
by Solomon is compared to <HI>the crackling
of thorns under a pot,</HI> a glittering and fer|vent
blaze, but &s;peedily extinct.</P>
<P>On the whole, let this be our conclu|&s;ion,
that both in pro&s;perity and in ad|ver&s;ity,
religion is the &s;afe&s;t guide of
human life. Conducted by its light, we
reap the plea&s;ures, and at the &s;ame time
e&s;cape the dangers, of a pro&s;perous &s;tate.
Sheltered under its protection, we &s;tand
the &s;hock of adver&s;ity with mo&s;t intrepi|dity,
and &s;uffer lea&s;t from the violence of
the &s;torm. <HI>He that de&s;ireth life, and loveth
many days that he may &s;ee good, let him keep
his tongue from evil, and his lips from guile.
Let him depart from evil, and do good. Let
him &s;eek peace with God, and pur&s;ue it.</HI>
Then, in his adver&s;ity, <HI>God &s;hall hide him
in his pavilion.</HI> In his pro&s;perity, <HI>he &s;hall
flouri&s;h like a tree planted by the rivers of
water. The ungodly are not &s;o; but are
like the chaff,</HI> light and vile, <HI>which the

relation to &s;piritual and eternal objects.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. IV.</NOTE>
He employs two metaphors, to repre&s;ent
more &s;trongly the di&s;advantages under
which we lie: One, that we &s;ee tho&s;e ob|jects
<HI>through a gla&s;s,</HI> that is, through the
intervention of a medium which ob&s;cures
their glory; the other, that we &s;ee them

have rendered by &s;eeing them <HI>darkly,</HI>
that is, the truth in part di&s;covered, in
part concealed, and placed beyond our
comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="94">
This de&s;cription, however ju&s;t and true,
cannot fail to occa&s;ion &s;ome perplexity
to an enquiring mind. For it may &s;eem
&s;trange, that &s;o much darkne&s;s &s;hould be
left upon tho&s;e cele&s;tial objects, towards
which we are at the &s;ame time command|ed
to a&s;pire. We are &s;trangers in the
univer&s;e of God. Confined to that &s;pot
on which we dwell, we are permitted to
know nothing of what is tran&s;acting in
the regions above us and around us. By
much labour we acquire a &s;uperficial ac|quaintance
with a few &s;en&s;ible objects
which we find in our pre&s;ent habitation;
but we enter, and we depart, under a total
ignorance of the nature and laws of
the &s;piritual world. One &s;ubject in par|ticular,
when our thoughts proceed in
this train, mu&s;t often recur upon the
mind with peculiar anxiety; that is, the
immortality of the &s;oul, and the future
&s;tate of man. Expo&s;ed as we are at pre|&s;ent
to &s;uch a variety of afflictions, and
&s;ubjected to &s;o much di&s;appointment in
all our pur&s;uits of happine&s;s, Why, it
<PB N="86" REF="95">
may be &s;aid, has our gracious Creator
denied us the con&s;olation of a full di&s;co|very
of our future exi&s;tence, if indeed
&s;uch an exi&s;tence be prepared for us?&mdash;
Rea&s;on, it is true, &s;ugge&s;ts many argu|ments
in behalf of immortality; Revela|tion
gives full a&s;&s;urance of it. Yet even
that go&s;pel which is &s;aid to have <HI>brought
life and immortality to light,</HI> allows us to
&s;ee only through a gla&s;s, darkly. It doth
not yet appear what we <HI>&s;hall be.</HI> Our
knowledge of a future world, is very im|perfect;
our ideas of it, are faint and con|fu&s;ed.
It is not di&s;played in any &s;uch
manner, as to make an impre&s;&s;ion &s;uited
to the importance of the object. The
faith even of the be&s;t men, is much infe|rior,
both in clearne&s;s and in force, to
the evidence of &s;en&s;e; and proves, on
many occa&s;ions, in&s;ufficient to counter|balance
the temptations of the pre&s;ent
world. Happy moments indeed there
&s;ometimes are in the lives of pious men,
when &s;eque&s;tered from worldly cares, and
born up on the wings of divine contem|plation,
<PB N="87" REF="96">
they ri&s;e to a near and tran&s;|porting
view of immortal glory. But
&s;uch efforts of the mind are rare, and
cannot be long &s;upported. When the
&s;pirit of meditation &s;ub&s;ides, this lively
&s;en&s;e of a future &s;tate decays; and though
the general belief of it remain, yet when
they return to the ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s and
cares of life, good men them&s;elves &s;eem
to rejoin the multitude, and to re-a&s;&s;ume
the &s;ame hopes, and fears, and intere&s;ts,
which influence the re&s;t of the world.</P>
<P>From &s;uch reflections, no &s;mall difficulty
re&s;pecting this important &s;ubject, either
ari&s;es, or &s;eems to ari&s;e. Was &s;uch an
ob&s;cure and imperfect di&s;covery of a fu|ture
&s;tate worthy to proceed from God?
Does it not afford &s;ome ground, either to
tax his goodne&s;s, or to &s;u&s;pect the evi|dence
of its coming from him?&mdash;This is
the point which we are now to con&s;ider;
and let us con&s;ider it with that clo&s;e at|tention
which the &s;ubject merits. Let us
enquire, whether we have any rea&s;on, ei|ther
to complain of Providence, or to ob|ject
to the evidence of a future &s;tate, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="88" REF="97">
that evidence is not of a more &s;en|&s;ible
and &s;triking nature. Let us attempt
humbly to trace the rea&s;ons, why, though
permitted to know and to &s;ee &s;omewhat
of the eternal world, we are neverthele&s;s
permitted only to <HI>know in part,</HI> and <HI>to &s;ee
through a gla&s;s, darkly.</HI></P>
<P>IT plainly appears to be the plan of the
Deity, in all his di&s;pen&s;ations, to mix
light with darkne&s;s, evidence with uncer|tainty.
Whatever the rea&s;ons of this pro|cedure
be, the fact is undeniable. He is
de&s;cribed in the Old Te&s;tament, as <HI>a God
that hideth him&s;elf</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xlv. 15.</NOTE>. <HI>Clouds and darkne&s;s</HI>
are &s;aid to <HI>&s;urround him. His way is in the
&s;ea, and his path in the great waters; his
foot&s;teps are not known.</HI> Both the works
and the ways of God are full of my&s;tery.
In the ordinary cour&s;e of his government,
innumerable events occur which perplex
us to the utmo&s;t. There is a certain limit
to all our enquiries in religion, beyond
which if we attempt to proceed, we are
lo&s;t in a maze of inextricable difficulties.
<PB N="89" REF="98">
Even that revelation which affords &s;uch
material in&s;truction to man, concerning
his duty and his happine&s;s, leaves many
doubts unre&s;olved. Why it was not given
&s;ooner; why not to all men; why there
&s;hould be &s;o many things in it <HI>hard to be
under&s;tood,</HI> are difficulties not incon&s;iderable
in the mid&s;t of that inconte&s;table evidence
by which it is &s;upported. If, then, the
future &s;tate of man be not placed in &s;o
full and clear a light as we de&s;ire, this is
no more than what the analogy of all re|ligion,
both natural and revealed, gave
us rea&s;on to expect.</P>
<P>But &s;uch a &s;olution of the difficulty will
be thought imperfect. It may, perhaps,
not give much &s;atisfaction, to &s;how that
all religion abounds with difficulties of a
like nature. Our &s;ituation, it will be &s;aid,
is &s;o much the more to be lamented, that
not on one &s;ide only we are confined in
our enquiries, but on all hands environed
with my&s;terious ob&s;curity.&mdash;Let us then,
if &s;o much di&s;&s;atisfied with our condition,
give &s;cope for once to Fancy, and con&s;ider
<PB N="90" REF="99">
how the plan of Providence might be
rectified to our wi&s;h. Let us call upon the
Sceptic, and de&s;ire him to &s;ay, what mea|&s;ure
of information would afford him en|tire
&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>This, he will tell us, requires not any
long or deep deliberation. He de&s;ires on|ly
to have his view enlarged beyond the
limits of this corporeal &s;tate. In&s;tead of
re&s;ting upon evidence which requires di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion,
which mu&s;t be &s;upported by much
rea&s;oning, and which, after all, he alledges
yields very imperfect information, he de|mands
the everla&s;ting man&s;ions to be &s;o di&s;|played,
if in truth &s;uch man&s;ions there be,
as to place faith on a level with the evidence
of &s;en&s;e. What noble and happy effects, he
exclaims, would in&s;tantly follow, if man
thus beheld his pre&s;ent and his future
exi&s;tence at once before him! He would
then become worthy of his rank in the
creation. In&s;tead of being the &s;port, as
now, of degrading pa&s;&s;ions and childi&s;h
attachments, he would act &s;olely on the
principles of immortality. His pur&s;uit
<PB N="91" REF="100">
of virtue would be &s;teady; his life would
be undi&s;turbed and happy. Superior to
the attacks of di&s;tre&s;s, and to the &s;olicita|tions
of plea&s;ure, he would advance, by a
regular progre&s;s, towards tho&s;e divine re|wards
and honours which were continu|ally
pre&s;ent to his view.&mdash;Thus Fancy,
with as much ea&s;e and confidence as if it
were a perfect judge of creation, erects a
new world to it&s;elf, and exults with ad|miration
of its own work. But let us
pau&s;e, and &s;u&s;pend this admirationh, till
we coolly examine the con&s;equences that
would follow from this &s;uppo&s;ed reform|ation
of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider the nature and &s;tate of man.
Introduced into the world in an indigent
condition, he is &s;upported at fir&s;t by the
care of others; and, as &s;oon as he begins
to act for him&s;elf, finds labour and indu|&s;try
to be nece&s;&s;ary for &s;u&s;taining his life,
and &s;upplying his wants. Mutual defence
and intere&s;t give ri&s;e to &s;ociety; and &s;o|ciety,
when formed, requires di&s;tinctions
of property, diver&s;ity of conditions, &s;ub|ordination
<PB N="92" REF="101">
ordination of ranks, and a multiplicity
of occupations, in order to advance the
general good. The $ervices of the poor,
and the protection of the rich, become
reciprocally nece&s;&s;ary. The governors, and
the governed, mu&s;t co-operate for general
&s;afety. Some arts mu&s;t be &s;tudied to cul
tivate the mind, &s;ome to ward off the
evils, and &s;ome to provide the convenien|cies
of life. In a word, by the de&s;tina|tion
of his Creator, and the nece&s;&s;ities of
his nature, man commences, at once, an
active, not merely a contemplative being.
Religion a&s;&s;umes him as &s;uch. It &s;up|po&s;es
him employed in this world, as on
a bu&s;y &s;tage. It regulates, but does not
aboli&s;h, the enterprizes and cares of ordi
nary life. It addre&s;&s;es it&s;elf to the vari
ous ranks in &s;ociety; to the rich and the
poor, to the magistrate and the &s;ubject
It rebukes the &s;lothfull; directs the dili|gent
how to labour; and requires every
man to <HI>do his own but&s;ine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, now, that veil to be with|drawn
which conceals another world from
<PB N="93" REF="102">
our view. Let all ob&s;curity vani&s;h: Let
us no longer &s;ee darkly, <HI>as through a gla&s;s;</HI>
but let every man enjoy that intuitive
perception of divine and eternal objects,
which the Sceptic was &s;uppo&s;ed to de&s;ire.
The immediate effect of &s;uch a di&s;covery
would be, to annihilate in our eye all hu|man
objects, and to produce a total &s;tag|nation
in the affairs of the world. Were
the glory of the cele&s;tial &s;tate opened to
our admiring view; did the angelic har|mony
&s;ound continually in our enraptured
ears; what earthly concerns could have
the power of engaging our attention for
a single moment? All the studies and pur|&s;uits,
the arts and labours, which now
employ the activity of man, which sup|port
the order, or promote the happine&s;s
of &s;ociety, would lie neglected and aban|doned.
Tho&s;e de&s;ires and fears, tho&s;e
hopes and intere&s;ts by which we are at
pre&s;ent &s;timulated, would cea&s;e to operate.
Human life would pre&s;ent no objects &s;uf|ficient
to rou&s;e the mind; to kindle the
&s;pirit of enterprize, or to urge the hand
<PB N="94" REF="103">
of indu&s;try. If the mere &s;en&s;e of duty
engaged a good man to take &s;ome part in
the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world, the ta&s;k, when
&s;ubmitted to, would prove di&s;ta&s;teful.
Even the pre&s;ervation of life would be
flighted, if he were not bound to it by
the authority of God. Impatient of his
confinement within this tabernacle of
du&s;t, langui&s;hing for the happy day of
his tran&s;lation to tho&s;e glorious regions
which were di&s;played to his &s;ight, he
would &s;ojourn on earth as a melancholy
exile. Whatever Providence has prepared
for the entertainment of man, would be
viewed with contempt. Whatever is now
attractive in human &s;ociety, would appear
in&s;ipid. In a word, he would be no
longer a fit inhabitant of this world, nor
be qualified for tho&s;e exertions which are
allotted to him in his pre&s;ent &s;phere of
being. But, all his faculties being &s;ubli|mated
beyond the &s;tate of mortality, he
would be in the condition of &s;ome being
of &s;uperior order, who, obliged to re&s;ide
among men, would regard human pur|&s;uits
<PB N="95" REF="104">
with inattention and &s;corn, as dreams,
trifles, and puerile amu&s;ements of a day.
But to this rea&s;oning it may perhaps
be replied, that &s;uch con&s;equences as I
have now &s;tated, &s;uppo&s;ing them to fol|low,
de&s;erve not much regard.&mdash;For what
though the pre&s;ent arrangement of human
affairs were entirely changed, by a clearer
view, and &s;tronger impre&s; &s;ion of our fu|ture
&s;tate? Would not &s;uch a change
prove the highe&s;t ble&s;&s;ing to man? Is not
his attachment to worldly objects the
great, &s;ource both of his misery and his
guilt? Employed in perpetual contempla|tion
of heavenly objects, and in prepara|tion
for the enjoyment of them, would
he not become more virtuous, and of
cour&s;e more happy, than the nature of his
pre&s;ent employments and attachments
permits him to be?&mdash;Allowing, for a
moment, the con&s;equence to be &s;uch, this
much is yielded, that upon the &s;uppo&s;ition
which was made, man would not be the
creature which he now is, nor human life
the &s;tate which we now behold. How
<PB N="96" REF="105">
far the change would contribute to his
improvement, comes to be considered.</P>
<P>It there be any principle fully a&s;cer|tained
by religion, it is, that this life
was intended for a &s;late of trial and im|provement
to man. His preparation for
a better world required a gradual purifi|cation,
carried on by &s;teps of progre&s;&s;ive
improvement. The Situation, therefore,
here assigined him, was &s;uch as to an&s;wer
this de&s;ign, by calling forth all his active
powers, by giving full &s;cope to his moral
di&s;po&s;itions, and bringing to light his whole
character. Hence it became proper, that
difficulty and temptation &s;hould ari&s;e in
the cour&s;e of his duty. Ample rewards
were promi&s;ed to virtue; but the&s;e re|wards
left, as yet, in ob&s;curity and di|&s;tant
pro&s;pect. The impre&s;&s;ions of &s;en&s;e
were &s;o balanced again&s;t the di&s;coveries
of divine objects, as to allow a conflict
between faith and &s;en&s;e, between con|&s;cience
and de&s;ire, between pre&s;ent plea|&s;ure
and future good. In this conflict,
the &s;ouls of good men are tried, improved,
<PB N="97" REF="106">
and &s;trengthened. In this field, their ho|nours
are reaped. Here are formed the
capital virtues of fortitude, temperance,
and &s;elf-denial; moderation in pro&s;perity,
patience in adver&s;ity, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the
will of God, and charity and forgivene&s;s
to men, amid&s;t the various competitions
of worldly intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Such is the plan of Divine Wi&s;dom for
man's improvement. But put the ca&s;e,
that the plan devi&s;ed by human wi&s;dom
were to take place, and that the rewards
of the ju&s;t were to be now fully di&s;played
to view; the exerci&s;e of all tho&s;e virtues
which I Have mentioned, would be en|tirely
&s;uper&s;eded. Their very names
be unknown. Every temptation
being withdrawn, every worldly attach|ment
being &s;ubduced by the overpowering
di&s;coveries of eternity, no trial of &s;incerity,
no dicrimination of characters, would
remain; no opportunity would be aff|orded
for tho&s;e active exertions, which
are the means of purifying and perfecting
the good. On the competition between
<PB N="98" REF="107">
time and eternity, depends the chief exer|ci&s;e
of human virtue. The ob&s;curity
which at pre&s;ent hangs over eternal ob|jects,
pre&s;erves the competition. Re|move
that ob&s;curity, and you remove hu|man
virtue from its place: You render
human life no longer that &s;tate of di&s;ci|pline,
by which imperfect creatures are
gradually &s;itted for a more perfect &s;tate.</P>
<P>Where then do we land at la&s;t, but in
this conclu&s;ion, that the full di&s;play,
which was demanded, of a future &s;tate,
would be &s;o far from improving the hu|man
&s;oul, that it would aboli&s;h tho&s;e vir|tues
and duties which are the great in&s;tru|ments
of its improvement? It would be
un&s;uitable to the character of man, in
every view, either as an active being, or
a moral agent. It would di&s;qualify him
for taking part in the affairs of the world;
for reli&s;hing the plea&s;ures, or for di&s;char|ging
the duties of life: In a word, would
entirely defeat the purpo&s;e of his being
placed on this earth. And the question,
Why the Almighty has been plea&s;ed to
<PB N="99" REF="108">
leave a &s;piritual world, and the future ex|i&s;tence
of man, under &s;o much obscurity,
re&s;olves in the end into this, Why there
&s;hould be &s;uch a creature as man in the
univer&s;e of God?&mdash;Such is the i&s;&s;ue of
the improvements proposed to be made on
the plans of Providence. They add to
the di&s;coveries of the &s;uperior wi&s;dom of
God, and of the pre&s;umption and folly
of man.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid, it now ap|pears,
that no rea&s;onable objection to the
belief of a future &s;tate ari&s;es, from the
imperfect di&s;coveries of it which we en|joy;
from &s;ome difficulties that are min|gled
with its evidence, from our <HI>&s;eelings as
through a gla&s;s darkly</HI> and being left to
<HI>walk by faith and not by &s;ight.</HI> It cannot
be otherwi&s;e, it ought not to be other|wi&s;e,
in our pre&s;ent &s;tate. The evidence
which is afforded, is &s;ufficient for the con|viction
of a candid mind, &s;ufficient for a
rational ground of conduct; though not
&s;o &s;triking as to withdraw our attention
<PB N="100" REF="109">
from the pre&s;ent world, or altogether to
overcome the impre&s;&s;ion of &s;en&s;ible ob|jects.
In &s;uch evidence it becomes us to
acquie&s;ce, without indulging either doubts
or complaints, on account of our not re|ceiving
all the &s;atisfaction which we fond|ly
de&s;ire, but which our pre&s;ent imma|turity
of being allows not. For upon the
&s;uppo&s;ition of immortality, this life is no
other than the childhood of existence;
and the mea&s;ures of our knowledge mu&s;t
needs be proportioned to &s;uch a &s;tate.
To the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;tages of human life,
from, infancy to old age, belong certain
peculiar attachments, certain cares, de|fires,
and interce&s;ts; which open, not ab|ruptly,
but by gradual advances, on the
mind, as it becomes fit to receive them,
and is prepared for acting the part to
which, in their order, they pertain.
Hence, in the education of a child, no
one thinks of in&s;piring him all at once
with the knowledge, the &s;entiments, and
views of a man, and with contempt for
the exerci&s;es and amu&s;ements of child|hood,
<PB N="101" REF="110">
On the contrary, employments
&s;uited to his age are allowed to occupy
him. By the&s;e, his powers are gradually
unfolded; and advantage is taken of his
youthful pur&s;uits, to improve and &s;trength|en
his mind.; till, &s;tep by &s;tep, he is led on
to higher pro&s;pects, and prepared for a
larger and more important &s;cene of action.</P>
<P>This analogy, which &s;o happily illustrates
the pre&s;ent conduct of the Deity towards
man, de&s;erves attention the more, as it is
the very illu&s;tration u&s;ed. by the Apo&s;tle,
when treating of this &s;ubject in the con|text.
<HI>Now, &s;ays he, we know in part|but
when that which is perfect is come, that
which is in part &s;hall be done away. When
I was a child, I &s;pake as a child, I under|&s;tood
as a child, I thought as a child; but
when I became a man, I put away childi&s;h
things. For now we &s;ee through a gla&s;s,
darkly; but then, face to face: Now I know
in part; but then, I &s;hall know even as I am
known.</HI> Under the care of the Almighty,
our education is now going on, from a
mortal to an immortal &s;tate. As much
<PB N="102" REF="111">
light is let in upon us, as we can bear
without injury. When the objects be|come
too &s;plendid and dazzling for our
&s;ight, the curtain is drawn. Exerci&s;ed
in &s;uch a field of action, as &s;uits the
&s;trength of our unripened powers, we are,
at the &s;ame time, by proper pro&s;pects and
hopes, prompted to a&s;pire towards the
manhood of our nature, the time when
<HI>childi&s;h things &s;hall be put away.</HI> But &s;till,
betwixt tho&s;e future pro&s;pects, and the
impre&s;&s;ion of pre&s;ent objects, &s;uch an ac|curate
proportion is etabli&s;hed, as on the
one hand &s;hall not produce a total con|tempt
of earthly things, while we a&s;pire
to tho&s;e that are heavenly; and on the
other, &s;hall not encourage &s;uch a degree
of attachment to our pre&s;ent &s;tate, as
would render us unworthy of future ad|vancement.
In a word, the whole cour&s;e
of things is &s;o ordered, that we may nei|ther
by an irregular and precipitate edu|cation,
become men too &s;oon; nor by a
fond and trifling indulgence, be &s;uffered
to continue children for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="112">
LET the&s;e reflections not only remove
the doubts which may ari&s;e from our
ob&s;cure knowledge of immortality, but
likewise produce the highe&s;t admiration
of the wi&s;dom of our Creator. The &s;truc|ture
of the natural world affords innume|rable
instances of profound de&s;ign, which
no attentive &s;pectator can &s;urvey without
wonder. In the moral world, where the
workman&s;hip is of much finer and more
delicate contexture, &s;ubjects of &s;till great|er
admiration open to view. But admi|ration
mu&s;t ri&s;e to its highe&s;t point, when
tho&s;e parts of the moral con&s;titution which
at fir&s;t were reputed blemi&s;hes, which car|ried
the appearance of objections, either
to the wi&s;dom or the goodne&s;s of Provi|dence,
are di&s;covered, on more accurate
in&s;pection, to be adju&s;ted with the mo&s;t
exqui&s;ite propriety. We have now &s;een,
that the darkne&s;s of man's present &s;tate is
no le&s;s e&s;&s;ential to his well-being, than
the light which he enjoys. His internal
powers, and his external &s;ituation, appear
to be exactly &s;itted to each other. Tho&s;e
<PB N="104" REF="113">
complaints, which we are apt to make of
our limited capacity and narrow views, of
our inability to penetrate farther into the
future de&s;tination of man, are found, from
the foregoing ob&s;ervations, to be ju&s;t as
unrea&s;onable, as the childi&s;h complaints
of our not being formed with a micro|&s;copic
eye, nor furni&s;hed with an eagle's
wing; that is, of not being endowed with
powers which would &s;ubvert the nature,
and counteract the laws of our pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P>In order to do ju&s;tice to the &s;ubject, I
mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the &s;ame rea&s;oning
which has been now employed with
re&s;pect to our knowledge of immorta|lity,
is equally applicable to many other
branches of intellectual knowledge. Thus,
why we are permitted to know &s;o little of
the nature of that Eternal Being who rules
the univer&s;e; why the manner in which
he operates on the natural and moral
world, is wholly concealed; why we are
kept in &s;uch ignorance with respect to
the extent of his works, to the nature and
agency of &s;piritual beings, and even with
<PB N="105" REF="114">
respect to the union between our own &s;oul
and body: To all the&s;e, and &s;everal other
enquiries of the &s;ame kind, which, often
employ the &s;olicitous re&s;earches of &s;pe|culative
men, the an&s;wer is the &s;ame that
was given to the intere&s;ting que&s;tion which
made the &s;ubject of our di&s;cour&s;e. The
degree of knowledge de&s;ired, would prove
incompatible with the de&s;ign, and the
proper bu&s;ine&s;s of human life. It would
rai&s;e us to a &s;phere too exalted; would
reveal objects too great and &s;triking for
our pre&s;ent faculties; would excite feel|ings
too &s;trong for us to bear; in a word,
would unfit us for thinking or acting like
human creatures. It is therefore re&s;erved
for a more advanced period of our na|ture;
and the hand of Infinite Wi&s;dom
hath in mercy drawn a veil over &s;cenes
which would overpower the &s;ight of mortals.</P>
<P>One in&s;tance, in particular, of Divine
Wi&s;dom, is &s;o illu&s;trious, and corre&s;ponds
&s;o remarkably with our pre&s;ent &s;ubject,
that I cannot pa&s;s over it without notice;
<PB N="106" REF="115">
that is, the concealment under which Pro|vidence
has placed the future events of
our life on earth. The de&s;ire of penetrating
into this unknown region, has ever
been one of the mo&s;t anxious pa&s;&s;ions of
men. It has often &s;eized the wife as well
as the credulous, and given ri&s;e to many
vain and impious &s;uper&s;titions throughout
the whole earth. Burning with curio&s;ity
at the approach of &s;ome critical event,
and impatient under the perplexity
of conjecture and doubt, how cruel is Pro|vidence,
we are apt to exclaim, in deny|ing
to man the power of fore-&s;ight, and in
limiting him to the knowledge of the pre|&s;ent
moment? Were he permitted to look
forward into the cour&s;e of de&s;tiny, how
much more &s;uitably would he be prepared
for the various turns and changes in his
life? With what moderation would he en|joy
his pro&s;perity, under the fore-know|ledge
of an approaching rever&s;e? And
with what eagerne&s;s be prompted to im|prove
the flying hours, by &s;eeing the in|evitable
term draw nigh which was to
finish his cour&s;e?</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="116">
But while Fancy indulges &s;uch vain de|fires
and criminal complaints, this covet|ed
fore-knowledge mu&s;t clearly appear to
the eye of rea&s;on, to be the mo&s;t fatal gift
which the Almighty could be&s;tow. If in this
pre&s;ent mixed &s;tate, all the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;cenes
of di&s;tre&s;s through which we are to pa&s;s,
were laid before us in one view, perpetual
&s;adne&s;s would overca&s;t our life. Hardly
would any transient gleams of interven|ing
joy be able to force their way through
the cloud. Faint would be the reli&s;h of
plea&s;ures, of which we fore&s;aw the clo&s;e:
Insupportable the burden of affictions,
under which we were oppre&s;&s;ed by the
load not only of pre&s;ent, but of antici|pated
&s;orrows. Friends would begin their
union, with lamenting the day which was
to di&s;&s;olve it; and, with weeping eye, the
parent would every moment behold the
child whom he knew that he was to lo&s;e.
In &s;hort, as &s;oon as that my&s;terious veil,
which now covers futurity, was lifted
up, all the gaiety of life would di&s;ap|pear;
its flattering hopes, its plea&s;ing il|lu&s;ions,
<PB N="108" REF="117">
would vani&s;h; and nothing but
its vanity and &s;adne&s;s remain. The fore|fight
of the hour of death would interrupt
the whole cour&s;e of human affairs;
and the overwhelming pro&s;pect of the future,
in&s;tead of exciting men to proper activity,
would render them immoveable with con|&s;ternation
and di&s;may.&mdash;How much
more friendly to man is that mixture of
knowledge and ignorance which is allotted
him in this &s;tate! Ignorant of the events
which are to befall us, and of the preci&s;e
term which is to conclude our life, by
this ignorance our enjoyment of pre&s;ent
objects is favoured; and knowing that
death is certain, and that human affairs
are full of change, by this knowledge our
attachment to tho&s;e objects is moderated.
Preci&s;ely in the &s;ame manner as by the
mixture of evidence and ob&s;curity which
remains on the pro&s;pect of a future &s;tate,
a proper balance is pre&s;erved betwixt our
love of this life, and our de&s;ire of a better.</P>
<P>The longer that our thoughts dwell on
this &s;ubject, the more we mu&s;t be convin|ced,
<PB N="109" REF="118">
that in nothing the Divine Wi&s;dom
is more admirable, than in proportioning
knowledge to the nece&s;&s;ities of man. In|&s;tead
of lamenting our condition, that we
are permitted only to <HI>&s;ee as through a gla&s;s
darkly,</HI> we have rea&s;on to ble&s;s our Crea|tor,
no le&s;s for what he hath concealed,
than for what he hath allowed us to know.
He is wonderful in coun&s;el, as he is excellent
in working. <HI>He is wi&s;e in heart, and his
thoughts are deep, How un&s;earchable are
the riches of the wi&s;dom and the knowledge
of God!</HI></P>
<P>FROM the whole view which we have
taken of the &s;ubject, this important in|ftruction
ari&s;es, That the great de&s;ign of
all the knowledge, and in particular of the
religious knowledge which God hath af|forded
us, is, to fit us for di&s;charging the
duties of life. No u&s;ele&s;s di&s;coveries are
made to us in religion: No di&s;coveries
even of u&s;eful truths, beyond the preci&s;e
degree of information, which is &s;ub&s;er|vient
to right conduct. To this great end
<PB N="110" REF="119">
all our information points. In this center
all the lines of knowledge meet. <HI>Life and
immortality are brought to light in the go&s;pel;</HI>
yet not &s;o di&s;played as to gratify the cu|rio&s;ity
of the world with an a&s;toni&s;hing
&s;pectacle; but only &s;o far made known,
as to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport us in the practice
of our duty. If the di&s;covery were more
imperfect, it would excite no de&s;ire of
immortality; if it were more full and
&s;triking, it would render us carele&s;s of
life. On the fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ition, no &s;ufficient
motive to virtue would appear; on the
&s;econd, no proper trial of it would remain.
In the one ca&s;e, we &s;hould think and act
like men who <HI>have their portion only in this
world;</HI> in the other ca&s;e, like men who
have no concern with this world at all.
Whereas now, by the wi&s;e con&s;titution of
Heaven, we are placed in the mo&s;t favour|able
&s;ituation for acting, with propriety,
our allotted part here; and for ri&s;ing, in
due cour&s;e, to higher honour and happi-ne&s;s
hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="120">
Let us then &s;econd the kind intentions
of Providence, and act upon the plan
which it hath pointed out. Checking our
inqui&s;itive &s;olicitude about what the Al|mighty
hath concealed, let us diligently
improve what he hath made knnown. In|habitants
of the earth, we are at the &s;ame
time candidates for heaven. Looking up|on
the&s;e as only different views of one
con&s;i&s;tent character, let us carry on our
preparation for heaven, not by ab&s;tract|ing
our&s;elves from the concerns of this
world, but by fulfilling the duties and of|fices
of every &s;tation in life. Living <HI>&s;o|berly
righteou&s;ly, and godly in the pre&s;ent
world, let us look for that ble&s;&s;ed hope and
the glorious appearing of the great God, and
our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI>
Before I conclude, it may be proper to
ob&s;erve, that the rea&s;&s;nings in this di&s;|cour&s;e
give no ground to apprehend any
danger of our being too much influenced
by the belief of a future &s;tate. I have
&s;hown the hurtful effects which would
follow from too bright and full a di&s;co|very
<PB N="112" REF="121">
of the glory of that &s;tate; and in
&s;howing this, I have ju&s;tified the decree
of Providence which permits no &s;uch di&s;|covery.
But as our nature is at pre&s;ent
constituted, attached by &s;o many &s;trong
connexions to the world of &s;en&s;e, and en|joying
a communication &s;o feeble and di|&s;tant
with the world of &s;pirits; we need
fear no danger from cultivating inter|cour&s;e
with the latter as much as po&s;&s;ible.
On the contrary, from that intercour&s;e
the chief &s;ecurity of our virtue is to be
&s;ought. The bia&s;s of our nature leans &s;o
much towards &s;en&s;e, that from this &s;ide
the peril is to be dreaded, and on this
&s;ide the defence to be provided.
Let us then <HI>walk by faith.</HI> Let us
&s;trengthen this principle of action to the
utmo&s;t of our power. Let us implore the
Divine Grace, to &s;trengthen it within us
more and more: That we may thence
derive an antidote again&s;t that &s;ubtle poi|&s;on,
which incellant commerce with the
objects of &s;en&s;e diffu&s;es through our &s;ouls;
that we may thence acquire purity and dignity
<PB N="113" REF="122">
dignity of manners, &s;uited to our divine
hopes; and, undefiled by the plea&s;ures of
the world, un&s;haken by its terrors, may
pre&s;erve to the end one con&s;tant tenor of
integrity. Till at la&s;t, having, under the
conduct of Chri&s;tian faith, happily fini&s;h|ed
the period of di&s;cipline, we enter on
that &s;tate where a far nobler &s;cene &s;hall

<Q>Je&s;us lift up his eyes to heaven, and &s;aid, Father, The hour is come;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE were the words of our ble&s;&s;ed
Lord on a memorable occa&s;&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM V.</NOTE> The
fea&s;t of the pa&s;&s;over drew nigh, at which
he knew that he was to &s;uffer. The night
was arrived, wherein he was to be deliver|ed
into the hands of his enemies. He
had &s;pent the evening in conference with
his di&s;ciples; like a dying father in the
mid&s;t of his family, mingling con&s;ola|tions
with his laft in&s;tructions. When he
<PB N="115" REF="124">
had ended his di&s;cour&s;e to them, he lifted
up his eyes to heaven, and, with the words
which I have now read, began that &s;olemn
interce&s; &s;ory prayer which clo&s;ed his mi|nistry.
Immediately after, he went forth
with his disciples into the garden of
Geth&s;emane, and &s;urrendered him&s;elf to
tho&s;e who came to apprehend him.
Such was the &s;ituation of our Lord at
the time of his pronouncing the&s;e words.
He &s;aw his mi&s;&s;ion on the point of being
accompli&s;hed. He had the prospect full
before him, of all that he was about to
&s;uffer.&mdash;<HI>Father, the hour is come!</HI>&mdash;What
hour? An hour the mo&s;t critical, the
mo&s;t pregnant with great events, &s;ince
hours had begun to be numbered, &s;ince
time had begun to run. It was the hour
in which the son of God was to termi|nate
the labours of his important life, by
a death &s;till more important and illu&s;tri|ous;
the hour of atoning, by his &s;uffer|ings,
for the guilt of mankind; the hour
of accompli&s;hing prophecies, types, and
Symbols, which had been carried on thro'
<PB N="116" REF="125">
a feries of ages; the hour of concluding
the old, and introducing to the world the
new di&s;pen&s;ation of religion; the hour
of his triumphing over the world,. and
death, and hell; the hour of his erecting
that &s;piritual kingdom which is to la&s;t for
ever. Such is the hour, &s;uch are the
events which you are to commemorate
in the &s;acrament of our Lord's Supper.
I &s;hall attempt to &s;et them before you as
proper subjects, at this time, of your
devout meditation. To display them, in
their genuine maje&s;ty, is beyond the abi|lity
of man.</P>
<P>I. This was the hour in which Chri&s;t
was glorified by his sufferings. The whole
of his life had di&s;covered much real great|ness
under a mean appearance. Through
the cloud of his humiliation, his native
lu&s;tre often broke forth; but never did it
&s;hine &s;o bright, as in this la&s;t, this trying
hour. It was indeed the hour of di&s;tre&s;s
and of blood. He knew it to be &s;uch; and
when the uttered the worlds of the Text,
<PB N="117" REF="126">
he had before his eyes the executioner and
the cro&s;s, the &s;courge, the nails, and the
&s;pear. But by &s;uch prospects his &s;oul was
not to be overcome. It is di&s;tre&s;s which
ennobles every great character; and di&s;tre&s;s
was to glorify the Son of God. He was
now to teach all mankind, by his example,
how to &s;uffer and to die. He was to
&s;tand forth before his enemies as the
faithful Witne&s;s of the truth; ju&s;tifying
by his behaviour the character which he
assumed, and &s;ealing with his blood the
doctrine which he taught.</P>
<P>What magnanimity in all his words
and actions on this great occa&s;ion! The
court of Herod, the judgement-hall of
Pilate, the hill of Calvary, were &s;o many
theatres prepared for his di&s;laying all the
virtues of a con&s;tant and a patient mind.
When led forth to &s;uffer, the fir&s;t voice
which we hear from him, is a generous
lamentation over the fate of his un|fortunate,
though guilty, country; and
to the last moment of his life, we behold
him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame gentle and
<PB N="118" REF="127">
benevolent &s;pirit. No upbraiding, no
complaining expre&s;&s;ion escaped from his
lips, during the long and painful ap|proaches
of a cruel death. He betrayed
no &s;ymptom of a weak or a vulgar, of a
di&s;compo&s;ed or impatient mind. With
the utmo&s;t attention of filial tenderne&s;s, he
committed his aged mother to the care of
his beloved di&s;ciple<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See John xix. 26, 27.</NOTE> With all the dig|nity
of a Sovereign, he conferred pardon
on a penitent fellow-fufferer. With a
greatne&s;s of mind beyond example, he
spent his la&s;t moments in apologies and
prayers, for tho&s;e who were &s;hedding his
blood.</P>
<P>By wonders in heaven, and wonders
on earth, was this hour di&s;tingui&s;hed.
All nature &s;eemed to feel it; and the dead
and the living bore witne&s;s to its import|ance.
The veil of the temple was rent in
twain. The earth &s;hook. There was
darkne&s;s over all the land. The graves
were opened, and many who &s;lept aro&s;e and
went into the Holy City. Nor were these
<PB N="119" REF="128">
the only prodigies of this awful hour.
The mo&s;t hardened hearts were &s;ubdued
and changed. The Judge, who in order
to gratify the multitude pa&s; &s;ed &s;entence
again&s;t the multitude pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence
again&s;t him, publickly atte&s;ted his innocence.
The Roman centurion, who pre|&s;ided
at the execution, glori&s;ied God, and
acknowledged the &s;ufferer to be more
than man. After he &s;aw the things which
had pa&s;&s;ed, he &s;aid, Certainly this was a
righteous per&s;on; truly, this was the son of
God. The Jewi&s;h malefactor, who was
crucified with him, addre&s;&s;ed him as a
King, and implored his favour. Even
the crowd of in&s;en&s;ible &s;pectators, who
had come forth as to a common &s;pectacle,
and who began with clamours and in|&s;ults,
returned home, &s;miting their breafs.
Look back on the heroes, the philo&s;o|phers,
the legi&s;lators of old. View them
in their la&s;t moments. Recall every
circum&s;tance which di&s;tingui&s;hed their de|parture
from the world. Where can you
find &s;uch a&s;&s;mblage of high virtues,
and of great events, as concurred at the
<PB N="120" REF="129">
death of Chri&s;t? Where, &s;o many te&s;ti|monies
given to the dignity of the dying
per&s;on, by earth, and by heaven?</P>
<P>II. THIS was the hour in -which Chri&s;t
atoned for the fins of mankind, and ac|compli&s;hed
our eternal redemption. It
was the hour when that great &s;acrifice
was offered up, the efficacy of which
reaches back to the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. of
man, and extends forward to the end of
time; the hour, when from the cro&s;s, as
from an high altar, that blood was flow|ing,
which wa&s;hed away the guilt of the
nations.</P>
<P>This awful di&s;pen&s;ation of the Almighty,
contains my&s;teries which are beyond
the di&s;covery of man. It is one of tho&s;e
things into which the angels de&s;ire to look.
What has been revealed to us, is, That
the death of Chri&s;t was the interpo&s;ition
of Heaven for preventing the ruin of hu|man
kind. We know, that under the go|vernment
of God, mi&s;ery is the natural
con&s;equence of guilt. After rational crca|tures
<PB N="121" REF="130">
had, by their criminal conduct, in|troduced
di&s;order into the divine king|dom,
there was no ground to imagine,
that by their penitence and prayers alone,
they could prevent the de&s;truction which
threatened them. The prevalence of pro|pitiatory
&s;acrifices throughout the earth,
proclaims it to be the general &s;en&s;e of
mankind, that mere repetance was not
of &s;ufficient avail to expiate &s;in, or to &s;top
its penal effects. By the con&s;tant allu|sions
which are carried on in the New
Te&s;tament to the &s;acrifices under the Law,
as pre-&s;ignifying a great atonement made
by Chri&s;t; and by the &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions
which are u&s;ed in de&s;cribing the effects of
his death, the &s;acred writers &s;how, as
plainly as language allows, that there was
an efficacy inhis &s;ufferings, far beyond
that of mere example and in&s;truction.
The nature and extent of that efficacy we
are unable, as yet, fully to trace. Part
we are capable of beholding; and the
wi&s;dom of what we behold, we have rea|son
to adore. We di&s;cern, in this plan of
<PB N="122" REF="131">
redemption, the evil of sin &s;trongly exhi|bited;
and the ju&s;tice of the divine go|vernment
awfully exemplified, in Chri&s;t
&s;uffering for &s;inners. But let us not ima|gine,
that our pre&s;ent di&s;coveries unfold
the whole influence of the death of Chri&s;t.
It is connected with causes into which we
cannot penetrate. It produces con&s;equen|ces
too exten&s;ive for us to explore. God's
thoughts are not as our thoughts. In all
things, we &s;ee only in part; and here, if
any where, we &s;ee al&s;o as through a gla&s;s,
darkly.</P>
<P>This, however, is fully manife&s;t, that
redemption is one of the mo&s;t glorious
works of the Almighty. If the hour of
the creation of the world was great and
illu&s;trious; that hour, when from the
dark and formle&s;s ma&s;s, this fair &s;y&s;tem
of nature aro&s;e at the divine command;
when the morning &s;tars &s;ang together, and
all the &s;ons of God &s;houted for joy; no le&s;s
illustrious is the hour of the re&s;toration of
the world; the hour when from condemn|ation
and mi&s;ery it emerged into happi|ne&s;s
<PB N="123" REF="132">
and peace. With le&s;s external ma|jesty
it was attended; but is, on that ac|count,
the more worderful, that under
an appearance &s;o &s;imple, &s;uch great events
were convered.
I. In this hour, the long &s;eries of
prophecies, vi&s;ions, types, and figures,
was accompli&s;hed. This was the center
in which they all met: This the pooint,
towards which they had tended and
verged, throught the cour&s;e of &s;o
many generations. You behold the Law
and the Prophets &s;tanding, if we may
&s;peak &s;o, at the foot of the cro&s;s, and
doing homage. You behold Mo&s;es and
Aaron bearing the ark of the convenant;
David and Elijah pre&s;enting the oracle
of te&s;timony. You behold all the prie&s;ts
and &s;acrifices, all the rites and ordinan|ces,
all the types and &s;ymbols, a&s;&s;em|bled
together to receive their con&s;um|mation.
Without the death of Chri&s;t, the
wor&s;hip and ceremonies of the law would
have remained a pompous, but unmean|ing
<PB N="124" REF="133">
in&s;titution. In the hour when he was
crucified, the book with the seven seals was
opened. Every rite a&s;&s;umed its &s;igfi|cancy;
every prediction met its event;
every &s;ymbol di&s;played its corres&s;pond|ence.</P>
<P>The dark, and &s;eemingly ambiguous
method of conveying important di&s;cove|ries
under figures and emblems, was not
peculiar to the &s;acred books. The Spirit
of God, in pre-fignifying the death of
Chri&s;t, adopted the &s;ame plan, according
to which the whole knowledge of tho&s;e
early ages was propagated through the
world. Under the veil of my&s;terious al|lu&s;ion,
all wi&s;dom was then concealed.
From the &s;en&s;ible world, images were
every where borrowed, to de&s;cribe things
un&s;een. More was under&s;tood to be
meant, than was openly expre&s;&s;ed. By
aenigmatical rites, the Prie&s;t communica|ted
his doctrines; by parables and alle|gories,
the Philo&s;opher in&s;tructed his di&s;|ciples;
even the Legi&s;lator by figurative
sayings, commanded the reverence of the
<PB N="125" REF="134">
people. Agreeably to this prevailing
mode of instruction, the whole di&s;pen|&s;ation
of the Old Te&s;tament was &s;o con|ducted,
as to be the &s;hadow and the
figure of a &s;piritual &s;y&s;tem. Every re|markable
event, every di&s;tingui&s;hed per|&s;onage,
under the Law, is interpreted in
the New Te&s;tament, as bearing &s;ome refe|rence
to the hour of which we treat. If
I&s;aac was laid upon the altar as an inno|cent
victim; if David was driven from
his throne by the wicked, and re&s;tored
by the hand of God; if the brazen &s;er|pent
was li&s;ted up, to heal the people; if
the rock -was &s;mitten by Mo&s;es, to furni&s;h
drink in the wilderne&s;s; all were types
of Chri&s;t, and alluded to his death.</P>
<P>In predicting the. &s;ame event, magni|ficent,
but &s;eemingly contradictory, was
the language of ancient prophecy; For it
foretold a Me&s;&s;iah, who was to be at once
a &s;ufferer and a conqueror. The Star was
to come out of Jacob, and the Branch to
&s;pring from the &s;tem of Je&s; &s;e. The Angel of
the Covenant, the De&s;ire of all Nations, was
<PB N="126" REF="135">
to come &s;uddenly to his temple; and to him
was to be the gathering of the people. Yet
at the &s;ame time, he was to be de&s;pi&s;ed and
rejected of men; he was to be taken from
pri&s;on, and from judgment; and to be led
as a lamb to the &s;laughter. Though he was
a man of &s;orrows, and acquainted with grief,
yet the Gentiles were to come to his light,
and Kings to the brightne&s;s of his ri&s;ing. In
the hour when Chri&s;t died, tho&s;e prophe|tical
riddles were &s;olved; tho&s;e &s;eeming
contradictions were reconciled. The ob|&s;curity
of oracles, and the ambiguity of
types, vani&s;hed. The Sun of righteou&s;hne&s;s
ro&s;e; and, together with the dawn of
religion, tho&s;e &s;hadows pa&s;&s;ed away.</P>
<P>IV. THIS was the hour of the abolition
of the Law, and the introduction of the
Go&s;pel; the hour of terminating the old,
and of beginning the new di&s;pen&s;ation of
religious knowledge and wor&s;hip, through|out
the earth. Viewed in this light, it forms the mo&s;t
augu&s;t aera which is to be
found in the hi&s;tory of mankind. When
<PB N="127" REF="136">
Chri&s;t was &s;uffering on the cro&s;s, we are
informed by one of the Evangeli&s;ts, that
he &s;aid, I thir&s;t; and that they filled a
&s;punge with vinegar, and put it to his
mouth. After he had ta&s;ted the vinegar,
knowing that all things were now accom|plished
and the &s;cripture fulfilled, he &s;aid,
It is fini&s;hed<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See John xix. 28, 29, 30.</NOTE>&mdash;; that is, This offered
draught of vinegar was the la&s;t circurn|&s;tance
predicted by an ancient Prophet<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pfal. Lxix. 21</NOTE>,
that remained to be fulfilled. The vi&s;ion
and the prophecy are now &s;ealed. The
Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation is clo&s;ed. And he
bowed his head, and gave up the gho&s;t.
It is fini&s;hed&mdash;When he uttered the&s;e
words, he changed the &s;tate of the uni|ver&s;e.
At that moment, the Law cea&s;ed,
and the Go&s;pel commenced. This was
the ever-memorable point of time, which
&s;eparated the old and the new world from
each other. On one &s;ide of the point of
&s;eparation, you. behold the Law, with its
prie&s;ts, its &s;acrifices, and its rites, retiring
from fight. On the other &s;ide, you behold
the
<PB N="128" REF="137">
the Go&s;pel, with its &s;imple and venerable
in&s;titutions, coming forward into view.
In this hour, the veil of the temple was
rent; and the glory departed from be|tween
the cherubims. The legal High
Prie&s;t delivered up his Urim and his
Thummim, his brea&s;t-plate, his robes,
and his incen&s;e: And CHRIST &s;tood forth
as the Great High Prie&s;t of all &s;ucceeding
generations. By that one sacrifice which
he now offered, he aboli&s;hed &s;acrifices for
ever. Altars on which the fire had blazed
for ages, were now to &s;moke no more.
Victims were no more to bleed. <HI>Not with
the blood of bulls and goats, but with his
own blood, he now entered; into the Holy
Place, there to appear in the prfence of God
for us.</HI></P>
<P>This was the hour of a&s;&s;ociation and
union to all the worshippers of God.
When Chri&s;t &s;aid, It is finished, he threw
down the wall of partition which had &s;o
long divided the Gentile from the Jew.
He gathered into one, all the faithful, out
of every kindred and people. He pro|claimed
<PB N="129" REF="138">
the hour to be come, when the
knowledge of the true God &s;hould be no
longer confined to one nation, nor his
wor&s;hip to one temple; but over all the
earth, the wor&s;hippers of the Father &s;hould
&s;erve him in &s;pirit and in truth. From that
hour, they who dwelt in the uttermo&s;t ends
of the earth, &s;trangers to the covenant of
promi&s;e, began to be brought nigh. In that
hour, the light of the Go&s;pel dawned from
afar on the Briti&s;h I&s;lands.</P>
<P>During a long cour&s;e of ages, Provi|dence
&s;eemed to be occupied in prepar|ing
the world for this revolution. The
whole Jewi&s;h oeconomy was intended to
u&s;her it in. The knowledge of God was
pre&s;erved unextingui&s;hed in one corner of
the world, that from thence, in due time,
might i&s;&s;ue forth the light which was to
over&s;pread the earth. Succe&s;&s;ive revela|tions
gradually enlarged the views of
men beyond the narrow bounds of Judaea,
to a more exten&s;ive kingdom of God.
Signs and miracles awakened their ex|pectation,
and directed their eyes towards
<PB N="130" REF="139">
this great event. Whether God de&s;cend|ed
on the flaming mountain, or &s;poke by
the Prophet's voice; whether he &s;cattered
his cho&s;en people into captivity, or re|&s;&s;emblel
them in their own. land; he was
&s;till carrying on a progre&s;&s;ive plan, which
was accompli&s;hed at the death of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Not only in the territories of I&s;rael, but
over all the earth, the great di&s;pen&s;ations
of Providence respected the approach of
this important hour. If empires ro&s;e or
fell; if war divided, or peace united the
nations; if learning civilized their man|ners,
or philo&s;ophy enlarged their views;
all was, by the &s;ecret decree of Heaven,
made to ripen the world for that fulne&s;s
of time, when Chri&s;t was to publi&s;h the
whole coun&s;el of God. The Per&s;ian, the
Macedonian, the Roman Conqueror, en|tered
upon the &s;tage, each at his predict|ed
period; and, though he meant not &s;o
neither did his heart think, &s;o mini&s;tered.
to this hour. The revolutions of power,
and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of monarchies, were &s;o
arranged by Providence, as to facilitate
<PB N="131" REF="140">
the progre&s;s of the Go&s;pel through the
habitable world, after the day had arrived,
when the &s;tone which was cut out of the
mountain, without hands, &s;hould become a
great mountain, and fill the earth<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot">Dan. Ii. 34, 35.</NOTE>. This
was the day, which Abraham faw afar off,
and was glad. This was the day, which
many Prophets and Kings, and righteous men9
de&s;ired to &s;ee, but could not; the day for
which the earne&s;t expectation of the creature,
long oppre&s;&s;el with ignorance, and
bewildered in &s;uper&s;tition, might be ju&s;t|ly
&s;aid to wait.
IV. THIS was the hour of Chri&s;t's tri|umph
over all the powers of darkne&s;s;
the hour in which he overthrew domi|nions
and thrones, led captivity captive,
and gave gifts unto men. The conte&s;t which
the kingdom of darkne&s;s had long car|ried
on again&s;t the kingdom of light, was
now brought to its cri&s;is. The period
was come, when the feed of the woman
&s;hould bruife the head of the &s;erpent. For
many ages, the mo&s;t gro&s;s superstitution had
<PB N="132" REF="141">
filled the earth. The glory of the uncorrupt|ible
God ivas every where, except in the
land of Judaea, changed into images made
like to corruptible man, and to birds, and
beafts, and creeping things. The world,
which the Almighty created for himself,
seemed to have become a temple of idols.
Even to vices and passions, altars were
rai&s;ed; and what was intitled Religion,
was in effect a di&s;cipline of impurity.
In the mid&s;t of this univer&s;al darkne&s;s,
Satan had erected his throne; and the
learned and polished, as well as the fa|vage
nations, bowed down before him.
But at the hour when Chri&s;t appeared on
the cro&s;s, the &s;ignal of his defeat was
given. His kingdom &s;uddenly departed
from him; the reign of idolatry pa&s;&s;ed
away; He was beheld to fall like lightening
from heaven. In that hour, the founda|tion
of every Pagan temple &s;hook. The
&s;tatue of every fal&s;e God tottered on its
ba&s;e. The Prie&s;t fled from his falling
&s;hrine; and the Heathen oracles became
dumb for ever.
<PB N="133" REF="142">
As on the cro&s;s Chri&s;t triumphed over
Satan, &s;o he overcame his auxiliary, the
world. Long had it a&s;&s;ailed him with
its temptations and di&s;couragements. In
this hour of &s;evere trial, he &s;urmounted
them all. Formerly head de&s;pi&s;ed the
plea&s;ures of the world. He now ba&s;&s;led
its terrors. Hence he is ju&s;tly &s;aid to have
crucified the world. By his &s;ufferings, he
ennobled diftre&s;s; and he darkened the
lu&s;tre of the pomp and vanities of life.
He discovered to his followers, the path
which leads, through affiction, to glory
and to victory; and he imparted to them
the &s;ame &s;pirit which enabled him to
overcome. My kingdom is not of this worlds.
In this ulorld ye shall have tribulation: But
be of good cheer; I have overcome the
world<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">John xvi. 33.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Death al&s;o, the la&s;t foe, of man, was
the victim of this hour. The formidable
appearance of the Spectre remained; but
his dart was taken away. For, in the
hour when Chri&s;t expiated guilt, he dis|armed
<PB N="134" REF="143">
death, by securing the re&s;urrection
of the ju&s;t. When he &s;aid to his peni|tent
fellow-sufferer, To-day thou &s;halt be
with me in paradi&s;e, he announced to all
his followers the certainty of heavenly
bli&s;s. He declared the cherubims to be
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and the flaming &s;word to be
&s;heathed, which had been appointed at
the fall, to keep from man the way of the
Tree of Life<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Gen. iii. 24</NOTE>. Faint, before this period,
had been the hope, indi&s;tinct the pro&s;pect,
which even good men enjoyed of the
heavenly kingdom. Life and immortality
were now brought to light. From the hill
of Calvary, the fir&s;t clear and certain
view was given to the world of the ever|la&s;ting
man&s;ions. Since that hour, they
have been the perpetual confolation of
believers in Chri&s;t. Under trouble, they
&s;ooth their minds; amid&s;t temptation,
they &s;upport their virtue; and, in their
dying moments, enable them to fay, O
Death! where is thy &s;ting? O Grave! where
is thy victory?</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="144">
IV. THIS was the hour when our Lord
erected that &s;piritual kingdom which is
never to end. How vain are the coun&s;els
and de&s;igns of men! How &s;hallow is the
policy of the wicked! How &s;hort their
triumphing! The enemies of Chri&s;t ima|gined,
that in this hour they had &s;ucce&s;s|fully
accompli&s;hed their plan for his de|struction.
They believed, that they had
entirely &s;cattered the &s;mall party of his
followers, and had extinguifhed his name
and his honour for ever. In deri&s;ion, they
addre&s;&s;ed him as a King. They cloath|ed
him with purple robes; they crowned
him with a crown of thorns; they put a
reed into his hand; and, with in&s;ulting
mockery, bowed the knee before him.
Blind and impious men! How little did
they know, that the Almighty was at that
moment &s;etting him as King on the hill of
Sion; giving him the Heathen, for his inheri|tance,
and the uttermo&s;t parts of the earth for
his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion! How little did they know,
that their badges of mock royalty were at
that moment converted into the &s;ignals of
<PB N="136" REF="145">
absolute dominion, and the in&s;truments of
irre&s;i&s;table power! The reed which they
put into his hands,. became a rod of iron,
with which he was to break in pieces his
enemies; a &s;ceptre, with which he was to
rule the univer&s;e in righteou&s;ne&s;s.
The cro&s;s, which they thought was to &s;tigma|tize
him with infamy, became the en&s;ign
of his renown. In&s;tead of being the
reproach of his followers, it was to be
their boa&s;t and their glory. The cro&s;s
was to &s;hine on palaces and churches,
throughout the earth. It was to be a&s;|&s;umed
as the di&s;tinction of the mo&s;t
powerful monarchs, and to wave in the
banner of victorious armies, when the
memory of Herod and Pilate &s;hould be
accur&s;ed; when Jeru&s;alem &s;hould be re|duced
to athes, and, the Jews be vaga|bonds
over all the world.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the triumphs which com|menced
at this hour. Our Lord &s;aw them
already in their birth; <HI>he &s;aw of the tra|vail
of &s;oul, and was &s;atis&s;ied.</HI> He be|held
the word of God going forth, con|quering,
<PB N="137" REF="146">
and to conquer; &s;ubduing to
the obedience of his laws, the &s;ubuers
of the world; carrying light into the re|gions
of darkne&s;s, and mildne&s;s into the
habitations of cruelty. He beheld the
Gentiles waiting below the cro&s;s, to re|ceive
the Go&s;pel. He beheld Ethiopia,
and the I&s;les &s;tretching out their hands to
God; the de&s;art beginning to rejoice, and to
blo&s;&s;om as the ro&s;e; and the knowledge of the
Lord filling the earth, as the waters cover
the &s;ea. &startq;Well plea&s;ed, he &s;aid, It is finish|ed.
As a conqueror, he retired from the
field, reviewing his triumphs: He bowed
his head, and gave up the gho&s;t.&mdash;From
that hour, Chri&s;t was no longer a mortal
man, but Head overall things to the Church;
the glorious King of men and angels,
of who&s;e dominion there &s;hall be no end.
His triumphs &s;hall perpetually increa&s;e.
His name &s;hall endure for ever; it &s;hall last
as long as the &s;un; men &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in
him, and all nations &s;hall call him ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="147">
SUCH were the tran&s;actions, such the
effects of this ever-memorable hour.
With all those great events was the mind of our
Lord filled, when he lifted up his eyes to
heaven, and Said, Father, the hour is come!
From the view which we Have taken of
this Subject, permit me to &s;ugge&s;t, what
ground it affords to confide in the mercy
of God for the pardon of &s;in, to tru&s;t
to his faithfulne&s;s for the accompli&s;hment
of all his promi&s;es, and to approach to
him, with gratitude and devotion, in
acts of worship.</P>
<P>IN the_fir&s;t place, The death of Chri&s;t
affords us ground to confide in the divine
mercy, for the pardon of &s;in. All the
&s;teps of that high di&s;pen&s;ation of Provi|dence,
which we have con&s;idered, lead
directly to this conclu&s;ion, He that &s;pared
not his own Son, but delivered him up for us
all, how &s;hall he not with him al&s;o freely
give us all things<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rom, viii. 32.</NOTE>'? This is the final re&s;ult
of the discoveries of the Go&s;pel. On this
re&s;ts that great &s;y&s;tem of con&s;olation,
<PB N="139" REF="148">
which it hath reared up for men.
We are not left to dubious and intricate rea|&s;onings,
concerning the conduct which
God may be expected to hold towards his
offending creatures. But we are led to the
view of important and illu&s;trious facts,
which &s;trike the mind with evidence irre|&s;i&s;tible.
For, is it po&s;&s;ible to believe, that
&s;uch great operations as I have endea|voured
to describe, were carried on by the
Almighty in vain? Did he excite, in the
hearts of his creatures, &s;uch high hopes,
without any intention to fulfil them?
After &s;o long a preparation of goodnefs,
could he mean to deny forgiveness to the
penitent, and the humble? When, over|come
by the &s;en&s;e of guilt, man looks up
with an a&s;loni&s;hed eye to the juftice of his
Creator, let him recollect that hour of
which the Text &s;peaks, and be com|forted.
The &s;ignals of divine mercy,
erected in his view, are too con&s;picuous
to be either di&s;tru&s;ted or mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>In the next place, the di&s;coveries of
this hour, afford the highe&s;t rea&s;on to
<PB N="140" REF="149">
trust in the divine faithfulnefs, for the
accompli&s;hment of every promi&s;e which
remains yet unfulfilled. For this was the
hour of the completion of God's ancient
covenant. It was the performance of the mercy
promi&s;ed to the fathers. We behold the
con&s;ummation of a great plan, which,
throughout a cour&s;e of ages, had been
uniformly pur&s;ued; and which, against
every human appearance, was, at the ap|pointed
moment, exactly fulfilled. No
word that is gone out of the mouth of the
Lord &s;hall fail. No length of time alters
his purpo&s;e. No obftacles can retard it.
Towards the ends accomplished in this
hour, the most repugnant in&s;trument were
made to operate. We di&s;cern God bend|ing
to his purpo&s;e, the jarring pa&s;&s;ions,
the oppo&s;ite interests, and even the vices
of men; uniting seeming contrarieties in
his scheme; making the wrath of man to
prai&s;e him; obliging the ambition of
Princes, the prejudices of the Jews, the
malice of Satan, all to concur, either in
bringing forward this hour, or in com|pleating
<PB N="141" REF="150">
its dec&s;tined effects. With what
entire confidence ought we to wait for
the fulfilment of all his other promi&s;es,
in their due time; even when events are
most embroiled, and the pro&s;pect is mo&s;t
di&s;couraging? Although thou &s;ayest, Thou
can&s;t not &s;ee him, yet judgment is before
him; therefore tru&s;t thou in him. Be at|tentive
only to perform thy duty; leave
the event to God; and be a&s;&s;ured, that
under the direction of his providence, all things,
all things &s;hall work together for a happy
i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>LASTLY, The con&s;ideration of this
whole &s;ubject tends to excite gratitude
and devotion, when we approach to
God in acts of wor&s;hip. The hour of
which I have di&s;cour&s;ed, pre&s;ents him to
us in the amiable light of the Deliverer
of mankind, the Re&s;torer of our forfeited
hopes. We behold the greatne&s;s of the
Almighty, &s;oftened by the mild radiance
of conde&s;cen&s;ion and mercy. We behold
him diminishing the awful distance at which
<PB N="142" REF="151">
which we &s;tand from his pre&s;ence, by ap|pointing
for us a Mediator and Interce&s;&s;or,
through whom the humble may, with|out
di&s;may, approach to Him who made
them. By &s;uch views of the Divine na|ture,
Chri&s;tian faith lays the foundation
for a wor&s;hip which &s;hall be at once ra|tional
and affectionate; a wor&s;hip, in
which the light of the under&s;tanding &s;hall
concur with the devotion of the heart,
and the mo&s;t profound reverence be unit|ed
with the mo&s;t cordial love. Chri&s;tian
faith is not a &s;y&s;tem of &s;peculative truths.
It is not a le&s;&s;on of moral in&s;truction on|ly.
By a train of high di&s;coveries which
it reveals, by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of intere&s;ting
objects which it places in our view, it is
calculated to elevate the mind, to purify
the affections, and, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
devotion, to confirm and encourage vir|tue.
Such, in particular, is the &s;cope of
that divine in&s;titution, the Sacrament of
our Lord's Supper. To this happy pur|po&s;e
let it conduce, by concentering, in
one &s;triking point of light, all that the
<PB N="143" REF="152">
Go&s;pel has di&s;played of what is mo&s;t im|portant
to man. Touched with ju&s;t con|trition
for pa&s;t offences, and filled with a
grateful &s;en&s;e of divine goodne&s;s, let us
come to the altar of God; and, with a
humble faith in his infinite mercies, de|vote
our&s;elves to his &s;ervice for ever.</P>

<Q>The wi&s;dom that is from above, is&mdash;gentle&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO be wi&s;e in our own eyes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VI.</NOTE> to be wi&s;e
in the opinion of the world, and
to be wi&s;e in the &s;ight of God, are three
things &s;o very different, as rarely to coin|cide.
One may often be wi&s;e in his own
eyes, who is far from being &s;o in the
judgment of the world; and to be reputed
a very wi&s;e man by the world, is no &s;e|curity
for being accounted wi&s;e by God.
As there is a worldly happine&s;s, which
God perceives to be no other than di&s;|gui&s;ed
mi&s;ery; as there are worldly ho|nours,
which in his e&s;timation are re|proach;
<PB N="145" REF="154">
&s;o there is a worldly wi&s;dom
which is <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s in his &s;ight.</HI> Of this
worldly wi&s;dom the characters are given
in the context, and placed in contra&s;t
with tho&s;e of the <HI>wi&s;dom which is from
above.</HI> The one is the wi&s;dom of the
crafty; the other, that of the upright.
The one terminates in &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; the
other, in charity. The one is full <HI>of &s;trife
and bitter envyings;</HI> the other, <HI>of mercy
and of good fruits.</HI> One of the chief cha|racters
by which the wi&s;dom from above
is di&s;tingui&s;hed, is <HI>gentlene&s;s,</HI> of which I
am now to di&s;cour&s;e. Of this there is the
greater occa&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e, becau&s;e it is
too &s;eldom viewed in a religious light;
and is more readily con&s;idered by the
bulk of men, as a mere felicity of nature,
or an exterior accompli&s;hment of man|ners,
than as a Chri&s;tian virtue which
they are bound to cultivate. I &s;hall fir&s;t
explain the nature of this virtue; and
&s;hall then offer &s;ome arguments to re|commend,
and &s;ome directions to faci|litate
the practice of it.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="155">
I BEGIN with di&s;tingui&s;hing true gen|tlene&s;s
from pa&s;&s;ive tamene&s;s of &s;pirit,
and from unlimited compliance with the
manners of others. That pa&s;&s;ive tamene&s;s
which &s;ubmits, without &s;truggle, to every
incroachment of the violent and a&s;&s;um|ing,
forms no part of Chri&s;tian duty;
but, on the contrary, is de&s;tructive of ge|neral
happine&s;s and order. That unli|mited
complai&s;ance, which, on every oc|ca&s;ion,
falls in with the opinions and
manners of others, is &s;o far from being a
virtue, that it is in it&s;elf a vice, and
the parent of many vices. It overthrows
all &s;teadine&s;s of principle; and produces
that &s;inful conformity with the world,
which taints the whole character. In the
pre&s;ent corrupted &s;tate of human man|ners,
always to a&s;&s;ent and to comply, is
the very wor&s;t maxim we can adopt. It
is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;upport the purity and
dignity of Chri&s;tian morals, without op|po&s;ing
the world on various occa&s;ions,
even though we &s;hould &s;tand alone. That
gentlene&s;s therefore which belongs to vir|tue,
<PB N="147" REF="156">
is to be carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed from
the mean &s;pirit of cowards, and the fawn|ing
a&s;&s;ent of &s;ycophants. It renounces
no ju&s;t right from fear. It gives up no
important truth from flattery. It is
indeed not only con&s;i&s;tent with a firm
mind, but it nece&s;&s;arily requires a manly
&s;pirit, and a fixed principle, in order to
give it any real value. Upon this &s;olid
ground only, the poli&s;h of gentlene&s;s can
with advantage be &s;uperinduced.</P>
<P>It &s;tands oppo&s;ed, not to the mo&s;t de|termined
regard for virtue and truth, but
to har&s;hne&s;s and &s;everity, to arrogance
and overbearing, to violence and oppre&s;|&s;ion.
It is, properly, that part of the
great virtue of charity, which makes us
unwilling to give pain to any of our
brethren. Compa&s;&s;ion prompts us to re|lieve
their wants. Forbearance prevents
us from retaliating their injuries. Meek|ne&s;s
re&s;trains our angry pa&s;&s;ions; can|dour,
our &s;evere judgments. Gentlene&s;s
corrects whatever is offen&s;ive in our man|ners;
and, by a con&s;tant train of humane
<PB N="148" REF="157">
attentions, &s;tudies to alleviate the burden
of common mi&s;ery. Its office, therefore,
is cxten&s;ive. It is not, like &s;ome other
virtues, called forth only on peculiar
emergencies; but it is continually in ac|tion,
when we are engaged in intercour&s;e
with men. It ought to form our addre&s;s,
to regulate our &s;peech, and to diffu&s;e it|&s;elf
over our whole behaviour.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t warn you, however, not to con|found
this gentle <HI>wi&s;dom which is from
above,</HI> with that artificial courte&s;y, that
&s;tudied &s;moothne&s;s of manners, which is
learned in the &s;chool of the world. Such
accompli&s;hments, the mo&s;t &s;rivolous and
empty may po&s;&s;e&s;s. Too often they are
employed by the artful as a &s;nare; too
often affected by the hard and unfeeling,
as a cover to the ba&s;ene&s;s of their minds.
We cannot, at the &s;ame time, avoid ob|&s;erving
the homage, which, even in &s;uch
in&s;tances, the &s;pirit of the world is con|&s;trained
to pay to virtue. In order to
render &s;ociety agreeable, it is found ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to a&s;&s;ume &s;omewhat, that may at
<PB N="149" REF="158">
lea&s;t carry its appearance. Virtue is the
univer&s;al charm. Even its &s;hadow is
courted, when the &s;ub&s;tance is wanting.
The imitation of its form has been re|duced
into an art; and, in the commerce
of life, the fir&s;t &s;tudy of all who would
either gain the e&s;teem, or win the hearts
of others, is to learn the &s;peech, and to
adopt the manners, of candour, gentlene&s;s,
and humanity. But that gentlene&s;s which
is the characteri&s;tick of a good man, has,
like every other virtue, its &s;eat in the
heart; And, let me add, nothing except
what flows from the heart, can render
even external manners truly plea&s;ing. For
no a&s;&s;umed behaviour can at all times
hide the real character. In that unaffect|ed
courte&s;y which &s;prings from a gentle
mind, there is a charm infinitely more
powerful, than in all the &s;tudied manners
of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed courtier.</P>
<P>True gentlene&s;s is founded on a &s;en&s;e
of what we owe to the God who made us,
and to the common nature of which we
all &s;hare. It ari&s;es from reflection on our
<PB N="150" REF="159">
own failings and wants; and from, ju&s;t
views of the condition, and the duty of
man. It is native feeling, heightened and
improved by principle. It is the heart
which ea&s;ily relents; which feels for every
thing that is human; and is backward
and flow to inflict the lea&s;t wound. It is
a&s;&s;able in its addre&s;s, and mild in its de|meanour;
ever ready to oblige, and will|ing
to be obliged by others; breathing
habitual kindne&s;s towards friends, cour|te&s;y
to &s;trangers, long-&s;uffering to ene|mies.
It exerci&s;es authority with mode|ration;
admini&s;ters reproof with tender|ne&s;s;
confers favours with ea&s;e and mo|de&s;ty.
It is una&s;&s;uming in opinion, and
temperate in zeal. It contends not eager|ly
about tri&s;les; flow to contradict, and
&s;till &s;lower to blame; but prompt to allay
di&s;&s;ention, and to re&s;tore peace. It neither
intermeddles unnece&s;&s;arily with the affairs,
nor pries inqui&s;itively into the &s;ecrets, of
others. It delights above all things to
alleviate di&s;tre&s;s, and, if it cannot dry up
the falling tear, to &s;ooth, at lea&s;t, the
<PB N="151" REF="160">
grieving heart. Where it has not the
power of being u&s;eful, it is never bur|den&s;ome.
It &s;eeks to plea&s;e, rather than
to &s;hine and dazzle; and conceals with
care, that &s;uperiority either of talents, or
of rank, which is oppre&s;&s;ive to tho&s;e who
are beneath it. In a word, it is that &s;pi|rit,
and that tenor of manners, which the
Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t enjoins, when it com|mands
us <HI>to bear</HI> one another's burdens; to
rejoice with tho&s;e who rejoice, and to weep
with tho&s;e who weep; to plea&s;e every one
his neighbour for his good; to be kind and
tender-hearted; to be pitiful and courteous;
to &s;upport the weak, and to be patient to|wards
all men.</P>
<P>Having now &s;ufficiently explained the
nature of this amiable virtue, I proceed
to recommend it to your practice. Let
me, for this end, de&s;ire you to con&s;ider
the duty which you owe to God; to con|&s;ider
the relation which you bear to one
another; to con&s;ider your own intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I. Con&s;ider the duty which you owe to
God. When you &s;urvey his works, no|thing
<PB N="152" REF="161">

and maje&s;ty. When you con&s;ult his
word, nothing is more remarkable, than
his attention to &s;often that greatne&s;s, and
to place it in the milde&s;t and lea&s;t op|pre&s;&s;ive
light. He not only charaterizes
him&s;elf as the <HI>God of con&s;olation,</HI> but, with
conde&s;cending gentlene&s;s, he particularly
accommodates him&s;elf to the &s;ituation of
the unfortunate. <HI>He dwelleth with the
humble and contrite. He hideth not his face
when the affticted cry. He healeth the broken
in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.</HI>&mdash;
when his Son came to be the Saviour of
the world, he was eminent for the &s;ame
attribute of mild and gentle goodne&s;s.
Long before his birth, it was prophe&s;ied
of him, that he &s;hould <HI>not &s;trive,</HI> nor cry,

of God is the pattern, &s;o the Holy Gho&s;t
is the in&s;pirer of gentlene&s;s. His name
is <HI>the Comforter,</HI> the <HI>Spirit of grace and
peace.</HI> His <HI>fruits,</HI> or operations on the
human mind, are <HI>love, meekne&s;s, gentlene&s;s,</HI>
and <HI>long-&s;uffering</HI><NOTE N="dagger" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 22</NOTE>.&mdash;Thus, by every
di&s;covery of the Godhead, honour is put
upon gentlene&s;s: It is held up to our
view, as peculiarly connected with Ce|le&s;tial
Nature. And &s;uitable to &s;uch di&s;|coveries,
is the whole &s;train of the Go&s;pel.
It were unnece&s;&s;ary to appeal to any &s;ingle
precept. You need only open the New
Te&s;tament, to find this virtue perpetually
inculcated. Charity, or love, is the ca|pital
<PB N="154" REF="163">
figure ever pre&s;ented to our view;
and gentlene&s;s, forbearance, and forgive|ne&s;s,
are the &s;ounds ever recurring on
our ear.</P>
<P>So predominant, indeed, is this &s;pirit
throughout the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation,
that even the vices and corruptions of
men have not been able altogether to
defeat its tendency. Though that di&s;|pen&s;ation
is far from having hitherto
produced its full effect upon the world,
yet we can clearly trace its influence, in
humanizing the manners of men. Re|markable,
in this re&s;pect, is the victory
which it has gained over tho&s;e powers of
violence and cruelty, which belong to the
infernal kingdom. Wherever Chri&s;tia|nity
prevails, it has di&s;couraged, and, in
&s;ome degree, aboli&s;hed &s;lavery. It has
re&s;cued human nature from that ignomi|nious
yoke, under which, in former ages,
the one half of mankind groaned. It has
introduced more equality between the two
&s;exes, and rendered the conjugal union
more rational and happy. It has abated
<PB N="155" REF="164">
the ferociou&s;ne&s;s of war. It has miti|gated
the rigour of de&s;poti&s;m, mitigated
the cruelty of puni&s;hments; in a word, it
has reduced mankind, from their ancient
barbarity, into a more humane and gentle
&s;late.&mdash;Do we pretend re&s;pect and zeal
for this religion, and at the &s;ame time al|low
our&s;elves in that har&s;hne&s;s and &s;eve|rity,
which are &s;o contradictory to its ge|nius?
Too plainly we &s;how, that it has
no power over our hearts. We may re|tain
the Chri&s;tian name; but we have
abandoned the Chri&s;tian &s;pirit.
II. Con&s;ider the relation which you
bear to one another. Man, as a &s;olitary
individual, is a very wretched being. As
long as he &s;tands detached from his kind,
he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, neither of happine&s;s, nor
of &s;trength. We are formed by Nature
to unite; we are impelled towards each
other, by the compa&s;&s;ionate in&s;tincts in
our frame; we are linked by a thou&s;and
connections, founded on common wants.
Gentlene&s;s, therefore, or, as it is very pro|perly
<PB N="156" REF="165">
termed, humanity, is what man, as
&s;uch, in every &s;tation, owes to man. To be
inacce&s;&s;ible, contemptuous, and hard of
heart, is to revolt again&s;t our own nature;
is, in the language of &s;cripture, to <HI>hide
our&s;elves from our own fle&s;h.</HI> Accordingly,
as all feel the claim which they have to
mildne&s;s and humanity, &s;o all are &s;en|&s;ibly
hurt by the want of it in others.
On no &s;ide are we more vulnerable. No
complaint is more feelingly made, than
that of the har&s;h and rugged manners
of per&s;ons with whom we have inter|cour&s;e.
But how &s;eldom do we transfer
the ca&s;e to our&s;elves, or examine how far
we are guilty of inflicting on others,
who&s;e &s;en&s;ibility is the &s;ame with ours,
tho&s;e very wounds of which we &s;o loudly
complain?</P>
<P>But, perhaps, it will be pleaded by
&s;ome, that this gentlene&s;s, on which we
now in&s;i&s;t, regards only tho&s;e &s;maller of|fices
of life, which in their eye are not
e&s;&s;ential to religion and goodne&s;s. Ne|gligent,
they confe&s;s, of the government
<PB N="157" REF="166">
of their temper, or the regulation of their
behaviour, on &s;light occa&s;ions; they are
attentive, as they pretend, to the great
duties of beneficence; and ready, when|ever
the opportunity pre&s;ents, to perform
important &s;ervices to their fellow-crea|tures.
But let &s;uch per&s;ons reflect, that
the occa&s;ions of performing tho&s;e import|ant
good deeds, very rarely occur. Per|haps
their &s;ituation in life, or the nature
of their connections, may in a great mea|&s;ure
exclude them from &s;uch opportuni|ties.
Great events give &s;cope for great
virtues; but the main tenor of human
life, is compo&s;ed of &s;mall occurrences.
Within the round of the&s;e, lie the mate|rials
of the happine&s;s, of mo&s;t men; the
&s;ubjects of their duty, and the trials of
their virtue. Virtue mu&s;t be formed and
&s;upported, not by unfrequent acts, but
by daily and repeated exertions. In or|der
to its becoming either vigorous or
u&s;eful, it mu&s;t be habitually active; not
breaking forth occa&s;ionally with a tran|&s;ient
lu&s;tre, like the blaze of the comet;
<PB N="158" REF="167">
but regular in its returns, like the light
of day: Not like the aromatick gale, which
&s;ometimes fea&s;ts the &s;en&s;e; but like the
ordinary breeze, which fans the air, and
renders it healthful.</P>
<P>Years may pa&s;s over our heads, with|out
affording any opportunity for acts
of high beneficence, or exten&s;ive utility.
Whereas not a day pa&s;&s;es, but, in the
common tran&s;actions of life, and e&s;pe|cially
in the intercour&s;e of dome&s;tick &s;o|ciety,
gentlene&s;s finds place for promot|ing
the happine&s;s of others, and &s;trength|ening
in our&s;elves the habit of virtue.
Nay, by &s;ea&s;onable di&s;coveries of a hu|mane
&s;pirit, we &s;ometimes contribute
more materially to the advancement of
happine&s;s, than by actions which are
&s;eemingly more important. There are &s;i|tuations,
not a few, in human life, where
the encouraging reception, the conde|&s;cending
behaviour, and the look of &s;ym|pathy,
bring greater relief to the heart,
than the mo&s;t liberal &s;upplies of bounty.
While, on the other &s;ide, when the hand
<PB N="159" REF="168">
of liberality is extended to be&s;tow, the want
of gentlene&s;s is &s;ufficient to fru&s;trate the
intention of the benefit. We four tho&s;e
whom we meant to oblige; and, by con|ferring
favours with o&s;tentation and
har&s;hne&s;s, we convert them into injuries.
Can any di&s;po&s;ition then be held to po&s;|&s;e&s;s
a low place in the &s;cale of virtue,
whole influence is &s;o con&s;iderable on the
happine&s;s of the world?</P>
<P>Gentlene&s;s is, in truth, the great ave|nue
to mutual enjoyment. Amid&s;t the
&s;trife of interfering intere&s;ts, it tempers
the violence of contention, and keeps alive
the &s;eeds of harmony. It &s;oftens ani|mo&s;ities;
renews endearments; and ren|ders
the countenance of man, a refre&s;h|ment
to man. Bani&s;h gentlene&s;s from the
earth; &s;uppo&s;e the world to be filled with
none but har&s;h and contentious &s;pirits;
and what &s;ort of &s;ociety would remain?
The &s;olitude of the de&s;ert were prefer|able
to it. The conflict of jarring ele|ments
in chaos; the cave, where &s;ubterra|neous
winds contend and roar; the den,
<PB N="160" REF="169">
where &s;erpents hi&s;s, and bea&s;ts of the
forre&s;t howl; would be the only proper
repre&s;entations of &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies of men.&mdash;<HI>O
that I had wings like a dove! for
then I would fly away, and be at re&s;t. Lo!
then, I would wander far off, and remain
in the winderne&s;s: I would ha&s;ten my e&s;cape
from the windy &s;torm and tempe&s;t: For I
have &s;een violence and &s;trife in the city.
Mi&s;chief and &s;orrow are in the mid&s;t of it:
Deceit and guile depart not from the &s;treet.</HI>
&mdash;Strange! that where men have all
one common intere&s;t, they &s;hould &s;o of|ten,
ab&s;urdly, concur in defeating it! Has
not Nature already provided a &s;ufficient
quantity of unavoidable evils for the &s;tate
of man? As if we did not &s;uffer enough
from the &s;torm which beats upon us with|out,
mu&s;t we con&s;pire al&s;o, in tho&s;e &s;ocie|ties
where we a&s;&s;emble, to find a retreat
from that &s;torm, to hara&s;s one another?
&mdash;But if the &s;en&s;e of duty, and of com|mon
happine&s;s, be in&s;ufficient to recom|mend
the virtue of which we treat, then
let me de&s;ire you,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. Iv. 6, 7, 8.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="170">
III. To con&s;ider your own intere&s;t.
Whatever ends a good man can be &s;up|po&s;ed
to pur&s;ue, gentlene&s;s will be found
to favour them. It prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;es and wins
every heart. It per&s;uades, when every
other argument fails; often di&s;arms the
fierce, and melts the &s;tubborn: Where|as
har&s;hne&s;s confirms the oppo&s;ition it
would &s;ubdue; and, of an indifferent
per&s;on, creates an enemy. He who could
overlook an injury committed in the col|li&s;ion
of intere&s;ts, will long and &s;everely
re&s;ent the flights of a contemptuous be|haviour.
&mdash;To the man of gentlene&s;s,
the world is generally di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;cribe
every other good quality. The higher
endowments of the mind we admire at
a di&s;tance; and when any impropriety of
behaviour accompanies them, we admire
without love. They are like &s;ome of the
di&s;tant &s;tars, who&s;e beneficial influence
reaches not to us. Whereas, of the in|fluence
of gentlene&s;s, all in &s;ome degree
partake, and therefore all love it. The
man of this character, ri&s;es in the world
<PB N="162" REF="171">
without &s;truggle, and flouri&s;hes without
envy. His misfortunes are univer&s;ally
lamented; and his failings are ea&s;ily for|given.</P>
<P>But whatever may be the effect of this
virtue on our external condition, its in|fluence
on our internal enjoyment is cer|tain
and powerful. That inward tran|quillity
which it promotes, is the fir&s;t re|qui&s;ite
to every plea&s;urable feeling. It
is the calm and clear atmo&s;phere, the &s;e|renity
and &s;un-&s;hine of the mind. When
benignity and gentlene&s;s reign within,
we are always lea&s;t in hazard of being
ruffled from without; every per&s;on, and
every occurrence, are beheld in the mo&s;t
favourable light. But let &s;ome clouds
of di&s;gu&s;t and ill-humour gather on
the mind; and immediately the &s;cene
changes; Nature &s;eems transformed; and
the appearance of all things is blackened
to our view. The gentle mind is like the
&s;mooth &s;tream, which reflects every ob|ject
in its ju&s;t proportion, and in its faire&s;t
colours. The violent &s;pirit, like troubled
<PB N="163" REF="172">
waters, renders back the images of things
di&s;torted and broken; and communicates
to them all, that di&s;ordered motion which
ari&s;es &s;olely from its own agitation.</P>
<P><HI>Offences mu&s;t come.</HI> As &s;oon may the
waves of the &s;ea cea&s;e to roll, as provo|cations
to ari&s;e from human corruption
and frailty. Attacked by great injuries,
the man of mild and gentle &s;pirit will
feel what human nature feels; and will
defend and re&s;ent, as his duty allows him.
But to tho&s;e &s;light provocations, and fri|volous
offences, which are the mo&s;t fre|quent
cau&s;es of di&s;quiet, he is happily
&s;uperiour. Hence his days flow in a far
more placid tenor than tho&s;e of others;
exempted from the numberle&s;s di&s;compo|&s;ures
which agitate vulgar minds. In|&s;pired
with higher &s;entiments; taught to
regard, with indulgent eye, the frailties of
men, the omi&s;&s;ions of the carele&s;s, the fol|lies
of the imprudent, and the levity of
the fickle, he retreats into the calmne&s;s of
his &s;pirit, as into an undi&s;turbed &s;anctu|ary;
and quietly allows the u&s;ual current
of life to hold its cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="173">
This virtue has another, and &s;till more
important connection with our intere&s;t,
by means of that relation which our pre|&s;ent
behaviour bears to our eternal &s;tate.
Heaven is the region of gentlene&s;s and
friend&s;hip; hell, of fiercene&s;s and animo|&s;ity.
If then, as the &s;cripture in&s;tructs us,
<HI>according to what we now &s;ow, we mu&s;t
hereafter reap;</HI> it follows, that the cultiva|tion
of a gentle temper is nece&s;&s;ary to pre|pare
us for future felicity; and that the
indulgence of har&s;h di&s;po&s;itions, is the
introduction to future mi&s;ery. Men, 1
am afraid, too often &s;eparate tho&s;e articles
of their belief which relate to eternity,
from the ordinary affairs of the world.
They connect them with the &s;ea&s;ons of
&s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and gravity. They leave them,
with much re&s;pect, as in a high region,
to which, only on great occa&s;ions, they
re&s;ort; and, when they de&s;cend into com|mon
life, con&s;ider them&s;elves as at liberty
to give free &s;cope to their humours and
pa&s;&s;ions. Whereas, in fact, it is their be|haviour
in the daily train of &s;ocial inter|cour&s;e,
<PB N="165" REF="174">
which, more than any other cau&s;e,
fixes and determines their &s;piritual cha|racter;
gradually in&s;tilling tho&s;e di&s;po&s;i|tions,
and forming; tho&s;e habits, which
affect their everla&s;ting condition. With
regard to trifles, perhaps, their malig|nant
di&s;po&s;itions may chiefly be indulged.
But let them remember well, that tho&s;e
trifles, by increa&s;ing the growth of pee|vi&s;hne&s;s
and pa&s;&s;ion, become pregnant
with the mo&s;t &s;erious mi&s;chiefs; and may
fit them, before they are aware, for being
the future companions of infernal &s;pirits
only.</P>
<P>I mean not to &s;ay, that in order to our
preparation for Heaven, it is enough to
be mild and gentle; or that this virtue
alone, will cover all our &s;ins. Through the
felicity of natural con&s;titution, a certain
degree of this benignity may be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
by &s;ome, who&s;e hearts are in other re|&s;pects
corrupt, and their lives irregular.
But what I mean to a&s;&s;ert, is, that where
no attention is given to the government
of temper, meetne&s;s for Heaven is not
<PB N="166" REF="175">
yet acquired, and the regenerating power
of religion is as yet unknown. One of
the fir&s;t works of the Spirit of God, is, to
infu&s;e into every heart which it inhabits,
that <HI>gentle wi&s;dom which is from above.
They who are Chri&s;t's, have crucified the
&s;le&s;h with its affections and lu&s;ts;</HI> but let
it not be forgotten, that among the <HI>works
of the fle&s;h, hatred, variance, emulations,
wrath, &s;tri&s;e, and envyings,</HI> are as expre&s;sly
enumerated, as <HI>uncleanne&s;s, murders, drunk|enne&s;s,</HI>
and <HI>revelling</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Cal. v. 19, 20, 21.</NOTE> They who conti|nue
either in the one or the other, <HI>&s;hall
not inherit,</HI> indeed can not inherit, <HI>the
kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus &s;hown the importance of
gentlene&s;s, both as a moral virtue, and
as a Chri&s;tian grace, I &s;hall conclude the
&s;ubjcct, with briefly &s;ugge&s;ting &s;ome con|&s;iderations
which may be of u&s;e to faci|litate
the practice of it.</P>
<P>For this end, let me advi&s;e you to view
your character with an impartial eye;
and to learn, from your own failings, to
<PB N="167" REF="176">
give that indulgence which in your turn
you mu&s;t claim. It is pride which fills
the world with &s;o much har&s;hne&s;s and
&s;everity. In the fulne&s;s of &s;elf-e&s;timation,
we forget what we are. We claim atten|tions,
to which we are not entitled. We
are rigorous to offences, as if we had ne|ver
offended; unfeeling to di&s;tre&s;s, as if
we knew not what it was to &s;uffer. From
tho&s;e airy regions of pride and folly, let
us de&s;cend to our proper level. Let us
&s;urvey the natural equality on which
Providence has placed man with man,
and reflect on the infirmities common to
all. If the reflection on natural equa|lity
and mutual offences be in&s;ufficient to
prompt humanity, let us at lea&s;t remem|ber
what we are in the &s;ight of God.
Have we none of that forbearance to give
to one another, which we all &s;o earne&s;tly
intreat from Heaven? Can we look for
clemency or gentlene&s;s from our Judge,
when we are &s;o backward to &s;how it to
our own brethren?
<PB N="168" REF="177">
Accu&s;tom your&s;elves, al&s;o, to reflect on
the &s;mall moment of tho&s;e things which
are the u&s;ual incentives to violence and
contention. In the ruffled and angry
hour, we view every appearance through
a fal&s;e medium. The mo&s;t incon&s;iderable
point of intere&s;t, or honour, &s;wells into $
momentous object; and the &s;lighte&s;t at|tack
&s;eems to threaten immediate ruin.
But after pa&s;&s;ion or pride has &s;ub&s;ided, we
look round in vain for the mighty mi&s;|chiefs
we dreaded. The fabrick, which
our di&s;turbed imagination had reared, to|tally
di&s;appears. But though the cau&s;e of
contention has dwindled away, its con|&s;equences
remain. We have alienated a
friend; we have embittered an enemy;
we have &s;own the &s;eeds of future &s;u&s;picion,
malevolence, or di&s;gu&s;t.&mdash;Su&s;pend your
violence, I be&s;eech you, for a moment,
when cau&s;es of di&s;cord occur. Antici|pate
that period of coolne&s;s, which, of it|&s;elf,
will &s;oon arrive. Allow your&s;elve
to reflect, how little you have any pro|&s;pect
of gaining by fierce contention; but
<PB N="169" REF="178">
how much of the true happine&s;s of life
you are certain of throwing away. Ea&s;i|ly,
and from the &s;malle&s;t chink, the bit|ter
waters of &s;trife are let forth; but with
difficulty is their cour&s;e re&s;trained; and
when once they begin to flow, they never
fail to poi&s;on his cup who was the fir&s;t to
give them pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>But gentlene&s;s will, mo&s;t of all, be pro|moted
by frequent views of tho&s;e great
objects which our holy religion pre&s;ents.
Let the pro&s;pects of immortality fill your
minds. Look upon this world as a &s;tate of
pa&s;&s;age. Con&s;ider your&s;elves as engaged in
the pur&s;uit of higher intere&s;ts; as acting
now, under the eye of God, an intro|ductory
part to a more important &s;cene.
Elevated by &s;uch &s;entiments, your minds
will become calm and &s;edate. You will
look down, as from a &s;uperiour &s;tation,
on the petty di&s;turbances of the world.
They are the &s;elfi&s;h, the &s;en&s;ual, and the
vain, who are mo&s;t &s;ubject to the impo|tence
of pa&s;&s;ion. They are linked &s;o
clo&s;ely to the world; by &s;o many &s;ides
<PB N="170" REF="179">
they touch every object, and every per|&s;on
around them, that they are perpetu|ally
hurt, and perpetually hurting others.
But the &s;pirit of true religion removes
us to a proper di&s;tance from the grating
objects of worldly contention. It leaves
us &s;ufficiently connected with the world,
for acting our part in it with propriety;
but di&s;engages us from it &s;o far, as to
weaken its power of di&s;turbing our tran|quillity.
It in&s;pires magnanimity; and
magnanimity always breathes gentlene&s;s.
It leads us to view the follies of men with
pity, not with rancour; and to treat, with
the mildne&s;s of a &s;uperiour nature, what
in little minds would call forth all the
bitterne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Aided by &s;uch con&s;iderations, let us
cultivate that gentle wi&s;dom which is,
in &s;o many re&s;pects, important both to
our duty and our happine&s;s. Let us a&s;|&s;ume
it as the ornament of every age, and
of every &s;tation. Let it temper the petu|lance
of youth, and &s;often the moro&s;e|ne&s;s
of old age. Let it mitigate autho|rity
<PB N="171" REF="180">
in tho&s;e who rule, and promote de|ference
among tho&s;e who obey. I con|clude
with repeating the caution, not to
mi&s;take for true gentlene&s;s, that flimzy
imitation of it, called poli&s;hed manners,
which often, among the men of the
world, under a &s;mooth appearance con|ceals
much a&s;perity. Let yours be na|tive
gentlene&s;s of heart, flowing from the
love of God, and the love of man. Unite
this amiable &s;pirit, with a proper zeal for
all that is right, and ju&s;t, and true. Let
piety be combined in your character
with humanity: Let determined integri|ty
dwell in a mild and gentle brea&s;t. A
character thus &s;upported, will command
more real re&s;pect, than can be procured
by the mo&s;t &s;hining accompli&s;hments,
when &s;eparated from virtue.</P>

to the chief dignity in his king|dom
Haman an Amalekite, who inhe|rited
all the ancient enmity of his race to
<PB N="173" REF="182">
the Jewi&s;h nation. He appears, from
what is recorded of him, to have been a
very wicked mini&s;ter. Rai&s;ed to greatne&s;s
without merit, he employed his power
&s;olely for the gratification of his pa&s;&s;ions.
As the honours which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed were
next to royal, his pride was every day fed
with that &s;ervile homage which is pecu|liar
to Afiatick courts; and all the ser|vants
of the King pro&s;trated thcm&s;elves
before him. In the mid&s;t of this general
adulation, one per&s;on only &s;tooped not to
Haman. This was Mordecai the Jew;
who, knowing this Amalekite to be an
enemy to the people of God, and, with
virtuous indignation, de&s;pi&s;ing that info|lence
of pro&s;perity with which he &s;aw
him lifted up, <HI>bowed not, nor did him re|verence.</HI>
On this appearance of di&s;re|&s;pect
from Mordecai, Haman <HI>was full</HI> of
wrath: But he thought &s;corn to lay hands
on Mordecai alone. Per&s;onal revenge was
not &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy him. So violent
and black were his pa&s;&s;ions, that he re|&s;olved
to exterminate the whole nation to
<PB N="174" REF="183">
which Mordecai belonged. Abu&s;ing, for
this cruel purpo&s;e, the favour of his cre|dulous
Sovereign, he obtained a decree to
be &s;ent forth, that, again&s;t a certain day,
all the Jews throughout the Per&s;ian domi|nions
&s;hould be put to the &s;word. Mean
while, confident of &s;ucce&s;s, and blind to
approaching ruin, he continued to exult
in his pro&s;perity. Invited by Aha&s;uerus
to a royal banquet, which E&s;ther the
Queen had prepared, <HI>he went forth that
day joyful, and with a glad heart.</HI> But be|hold
how &s;light an incident was &s;uffi|cient
to poi&s;on his joy! As he went forth,
he &s;aw Mordecai in the King's gate; and
ob&s;erved, that &s;till he refu&s;ed to do him
homage: <HI>He &s;tood not up, nor was moved
for him;</HI> although he well knew the for|midable
de&s;igns which Haman was pre|paring
to execute. One private man, who
de&s;pi&s;ed his greatne&s;s, and di&s;dained &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion,
while a whole kingdom trembled
before him; one &s;pirit, which the utmo&s;t
&s;tretch of his power could neither &s;ubdue
nor humble, bla&s;ted his triumphs. His
<PB N="175" REF="184">
whole &s;oul was &s;haken with a &s;torm of
pa&s;&s;ion. Wrath, pride, and de&s;ire of re|venge,
ro&s;e into fury. With difficulty he
re&s;trained him&s;elf in publick; but as &s;oon
as he came to his own hou&s;e, he was
forced to di&s;clo&s;e the agony of his mind.
He gathered together his friends and fa|mily,
with Zere&s;h his wife. <HI>He told them
of the glory of his riches, and the multitude
of his children, and all the things wherein
the King had promoted him, and how he had
advanced him above the princes and &s;er|vants
of the King. He &s;aid, moreover, Yea
E&s;ther the Queen did let no man come in
with the King, unto the banquet that &s;he
had prepared, but my&s;elf; and to-morrow
also am I invited unto her with the King.</HI>
After all this preamble, what is the conclu&s;ion?&mdash;Yet all this availeth me nothing, &s;o long as I &s;ee Mordecai the few fitting at the King's gate.</P>
<P>The &s;equel of Haman's history I &s;hall
not now pursuce. It might afford matter
for much instruction, by the con&s;picuous
ju&s;tice of God in his fall and puni&s;hment.
<PB N="176" REF="185">
But, contemplating only the &s;ingular &s;itu|ation
in which the Text pre&s;ents him, and
the violent agitation of his mind which
it di&s;plays, the following reflections na|turally
ari&s;e, which, together with &s;ome
practical improvements, &s;hall make the
&s;ubject of this di&s;cour&s;e. I. How mi&s;er|able
is vice, when one guilty pa&s;&s;ion cre|ates
&s;o much torment! II. How unavail|ing
is pro&s;perity, when, in the height of
it, a &s;ingle di&s;appointment can de&s;troy the
reli&s;h of all its plea&s;ures! III. How weak
is human nature, which, in the ab&s;ence
of real, is thus prone to form to it&s;elf
imaginary woes!</P>
<P>I. How mi&s;erable is vice, when one
guilty pa&s;&s;ion is capable of creating &s;o
much torment! When we di&s;cour&s;e to
you of the internal mi&s;ery of &s;inners;
whcn we repre&s;ent the pangs which they
&s;uffer from violent pa&s;&s;ions, and a corrupt|ed
heart; we are &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pected of
chu&s;ing a theme for declamation, and of
heightening the picture which we draw,
<PB N="177" REF="186">
by colours borrowed from fancy. They
who&s;e minds are, by nature, happily tran|quil,
or who&s;e &s;ituation in life removes
them from the di&s;turbance and tumuls of
pa&s;&s;ion, can hardly conceive, that, as long
as the body is at ea&s;e, and the external con|dition
pro&s;perous, any thing which pa&s;&s;es
within the mind &s;hould cau&s;e &s;uch exqui&s;ite
woe. But, for the truth of our a&s;&s;ertions,
we appeal to the hi&s;tory of mankind. We
might rea&s;on from the con&s;titution of the
rational frame; where the under&s;tanding
is appointed to be &s;upreme, and the pa&s;|&s;ions
to be &s;ubordinate; and where, if
this due arrangement of its parts be over|thrown,
mi&s;ery as nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ues, as
pain is con&s;equent in the animal frame,
upon the di&s;tortion of its members. But
laying &s;peculations of this kind a&s;ide, it
is &s;ufficient to lead you to the view of
facts, the import of which can neither
be controverted, nor mi&s;taken. This is,
indeed, the great advantage of hi&s;tory,
that it is a mirrour which holds up man|kind
to their own view. For, in all ages,
<PB N="178" REF="187">
human nature has been the &s;ame. In the
circle of worldly affairs, the &s;ame charac|ters
and &s;ituations are perpetually return|ing;
and in the follies and pa&s;&s;ions, the
vices and crimes, of the generations that
are pa&s;t, we read tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Attend, then, to the in&s;tance now be|fore
us; and conceive, if you can, a per|&s;on
more thoroughly wretched, than one
reduced to make this humiliating confe&s;|&s;ion,
that, though &s;urrounded with power,
opulence and plea&s;ure, he was lo&s;t to all
happine&s;s, through the fiercene&s;s of his re|&s;entment;
and was at that moment &s;tung
by di&s;appointment, and torn by rage, be|yond
what he could bear. <HI>All this avail|eth</HI>
me nothing, &s;o long as I &s;ee Mordecai the
few &s;itting at the King's gate. Had this
been a &s;oliloquy of Haman's with him&s;elf,
it would have been a &s;ufficient di&s;covery
of his mi&s;ery. But when we con&s;ider it
as a confe&s;&s;ion which he makes to others,
it is a proof that his mi&s;ery was be|come
in&s;upportable. For &s;uch agitations
of the mind, every man &s;trives to con|ceal,
<PB N="179" REF="188">
becau&s;e he knows they di&s;honour
him. Other griefs and &s;orrows, he can,
with freedom, pour out to a confident.
What he &s;uffers from the inju&s;tice or ma|lice
of the world, he is not a&s;hamed to
acknowledge. But when his &s;uffering
ari&s;es from the bad di&s;po&s;itions of his own
heart; when, in the height of pro&s;perity,
he is rendered mi&s;erable, &s;olely by di&s;ap|pointed
pride, every ordinary motive for
communication cea&s;es. Nothing but the
violence of angui&s;h, can drive him to con|fe&s;s
a pa&s;&s;ion which renders him odious,
and a weakne&s;s which renders him de&s;|picable.
To what extremity, in parti|cular,
mu&s;t he be reduced, before he can
di&s;clo&s;e to his own family the infamous
&s;ecret of his mi&s;ery? In the eye of his
family every man wi&s;hes to appear re|&s;pectable,
and to cover from their know|ledge
whatever may vilify or degrade
him. Attacked or reproached abroad, he
con&s;oles him&s;elf with his importance at
home; and in dome&s;tick attachment and
re&s;pect, &s;eeks for &s;ome compen&s;ation for
<PB N="180" REF="189">
the inju&s;tice of the world.&mdash;Judge, then,
of the degree of torment which Haman
endured, by its breaking through all the&s;e
re&s;traints, and forcing him to publi&s;h his
&s;hame before tho&s;e, from whom all men
&s;eek mo&s;t to hide it. How &s;evere mu&s;t
have been the conflict which he under|went
within him&s;elf, before he called to|gether
his wife and all his friends for
this purpo&s;e? How dreadful the agony
he &s;uffered at the moment of his confe&s;&s;ion,
when, to the a&s;toni&s;hed company,
he laid open the cau&s;e of his di&s;tre&s;s?</P>
<P>A&s;&s;emble all the evils which poverty,
di&s;ea&s;e, or violence can inflict, and their
&s;tings will be found by far le&s;s pungent,
than tho&s;e which &s;uch guilty pa&s;&s;ions
dart into the heart. Amid&s;t the ordi|nary
calamities of the world, the mind
can exert its powers, and &s;ugge&s;t relief:
And the mind is properly the man; the
&s;ufferer, and his &s;ufferings, can be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed.
But tho&s;e di&s;orders of pa&s;&s;ion,
by &s;eizing directly on the mind, attack
human nature in its &s;trong hold, and
<PB N="181" REF="190">
cut off its la&s;t re&s;ource. They penetrate
to the very &s;eat of &s;en&s;ation; and convert
all the powers of thought into in&s;tru|ments
of torture.</P>
<P>Let us remark, in the event that is now
before us, the awful hand of God; and
admire his ju&s;tice, in thus making the
&s;inner's <HI>own wickedne&s;s to reprove him, and
his back&s;lidings to correct him.</HI> Scepticks
rea&s;on in vain again&s;t the reality of a di|vine
government. It is not the &s;ubject
of di&s;pute. It is a fact which carries the
evidence of &s;en&s;e, and di&s;plays it&s;elf be|fore
our eyes. We &s;ee the Almighty ma|nife&s;tly
<HI>pur&s;uing the &s;inner with evil.</HI> We
&s;ee him connecting with every &s;ignal de|viation
from duty, tho&s;e wounds of the
&s;pirit which occa&s;ion the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite
torment. He hath not merely promul|gated
his laws now, and delayed the di&s;|tribution
of rewards and puni&s;hments,
until a future period of being. But the
&s;anctions of his laws already take place;
their effects appear; and with &s;uch infi|nite
wi&s;dom are they contrived, as to
<PB N="182" REF="191">
require no other executioners of ju&s;tice
again&s;t the &s;inner, than his own guilty
pa&s;&s;ions. God needs not come forth from
his &s;ecret place, in order to bring him to
puni&s;hment. He needs not call thunder
down from the heavens, nor rai&s;e any
mini&s;ter of wrath from the aby&s;s below.
He need only &s;ay, <HI>Ephraim is joined to his
idols; let him alone:</HI> And, at that in&s;tant,
the &s;inner becomes his own tormentor.
The infernal fire begins, of it&s;elf, to kindle
within him. The worm that never dies,
&s;eizes on his heart.</P>
<P>Let us remark al&s;o, from this example,
how imperfectly we can judge from ex|ternal
appearances, concerning real hap|pine&s;s
or mi&s;ery. All Per&s;ia, it is pro|bable,
envied Haman as the happie&s;t per|&s;on
in the empire; while yet, at the mo|ment
when we now con&s;ider him, there
was not within its bounds, one more
thoroughly wretched. We are &s;educed
and deceived, by that fal&s;e glare which
pro&s;perity &s;ometimes throws around bad
men. We are tempted to imitate their
<PB N="183" REF="192">
crimes, in order to partake of their ima|gined
felicity. But remember Haman,
and beware of the &s;nare. Think not,
when you behold a pageant of grandeur
di&s;played to publick view, that you di&s;|cern
the en&s;ign of certain happine&s;s. In
order to form any ju&s;t conclu&s;ion, you
mu&s;t follow the great man into the re|tired
apartment, where he lays a&s;ide his
di&s;gui&s;e. You mu&s;t not only be able to
penetrate into the interior of families,
but you mu&s;t have a faculty by which
you can look into the in&s;ide of hearts.
Were you endowed with &s;uch a power,
you would mo&s;t commonly behold good
men, in proportion to their goodne&s;s,
&s;atisfied and ea&s;y; you would behold
atrocious &s;inners, always re&s;tle&s;s and un|happy.</P>
<P>Unju&s;t are our complaints, of the pro|mi&s;cuous
di&s;tribution made by Provi|dence
of its favours among men. From
&s;uperficial views &s;uch complaints ari&s;e.
The di&s;tribution of the goods of fortune,
indeed, may often be pron$$$cuous; that
<PB N="184" REF="193">
is, di&s;proportioned to the moral charac|ters
of men; but the allotment of real
happine&s;s is never &s;o. For <HI>to the wicked
there is no peace. They are like the troubled
&s;ea when it cannot re&s;t. They travel with
pain all their days. Trouble and angui&s;h
prevail again&s;t them. Terrours make them
afraid on every &s;ide. A dreadful &s;ound is
in their ears; and they are in great fear
where no fear is.</HI>&mdash;Hitherto we have
con&s;idered Haman under the character of
a very wicked man, tormented by crimi|nal
pa&s;&s;ions. Let us now con&s;ider him,
merely as a child of fortune, a pro&s;per|ous
man of the world; and proceed to
ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>II. How unavailing worldly pro&s;perity
is, &s;ince, in the mid&s;t of it, a &s;ingle di&s;|appointment
is &s;ufficient to embitter all
its plea&s;ures. We might at fir&s;t imagine,
that the natural effect of pro&s;perity would
be, to diffu&s;e over the mind a prevailing
&s;ati&s;faction, which the le&s;&s;er evils of life
could not ruffle or di&s;turb. We might
<PB N="185" REF="194">
expect, that as one in the full glow of
health, de&s;pi&s;es the inclemency of wea|ther;
&s;o one in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the advan|tages
of high power and &s;tation, &s;hould
di&s;regard &s;light injuries; and, at perfect
ea&s;e within him&s;elf, &s;hould view, in the
mo&s;t favourable light, the behaviour of
others around him. Such effects would
indeed follow, if worldly pro&s;perity con|tained
in it&s;elf the true principles of hu|man
felicity. But as it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them
not, the very rever&s;e of tho&s;e con&s;equen|ces
generally obtains. Pro&s;perity debili|tates,
in&s;tead of &s;trengthening the mind.
Its mo&s;t common effect is, to create an
extreme &s;en&s;ibility to the &s;lighte&s;t wound.
It foments impatient de&s;ires; and rai&s;es
expectations which no &s;ucce&s;s can &s;atisfy.
It fo&s;ters a fal&s;e delicacy, which &s;ickens
in the mid&s;t of indulgence. By repeat|ed
gratification, it blunts the feelings of
men to what is plea&s;ing; and leaves them
unhappily acute to whatever is unea&s;y.
Hence, the gale which another would
&s;carcely feel, is, to the pro&s;perous, a rude
<PB N="186" REF="195">
tempe&s;t. Hence, the ro&s;e-leaf doubled
below them on the couch, as is told of
the effeminate Sybarite, breaks their re&s;t.
Hence, the di&s;re&s;pect &s;hown by Mordecai,
preyed with &s;uch violence on the heart of
Haman. Upon no principle of rea&s;on
can we a&s;&s;ign a &s;ufficient cau&s;e for all the
di&s;tre&s;s which this incident occa&s;ioned to
him. The cau&s;e lay not in the external
incident. It lay within him&s;elf; it aro&s;e
from a mind di&s;tempered by pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Let this example correct that blind
eagerne&s;s, with which we ru&s;h to the
chace of worldly greatne&s;s and honours.
I &s;ay not, that it &s;hould altogether divert
us from pur&s;uing them; &s;ince, when en|joyed
with temperance and wi&s;dom, they
may doubtle&s;s both enlarge our utility,
and contribute to our comfort. But let it
teach us, not to over-rate them. Let it
convince us, that unle&s;s we add to them
the nece&s;&s;ary correctives of piety and vir|tue,
they are, by them&s;elves, more likely
to render us wretched, than to make us
happy.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="196">
Let the memorable fate of Haman &s;ug|ge&s;t
to us al&s;o, how often, be&s;ides cor|rupting
the mind, and engendering in|ternal
mi&s;ery, they lead us to precipices,
and involve us in ruin. At the moment
when Fortune &s;eemed to &s;mile upon him,
with the mo&s;t &s;erene and &s;ettled a&s;pect,
&s;he was digging in &s;ecret the pit for his
fall; &s;he was weaving around his head
the web of de&s;truction. Succe&s;s inflam|ed
his pride; pride in&s;pired him with
in&s;atiable thir&s;t of revenge; the revenge
which, for the &s;ake of one man, he &s;ought
to execute on a whole nation, incen&s;ed
the Queen; and he is doomed to &s;uffer
the &s;ame death, which he had prepared
for Mordecai.&mdash;Had Haman remained
in a private &s;tation, he might have ar|rived
at a peaceable old age. He might
have been, I &s;hall not &s;ay, a good or a
happy man, yet probably le&s;s guilty by
far, and le&s;s wretched, than when placed
at the head of the greate&s;t empire in the
Ea&s;t. <HI>Who knoweth what is good for man
in this life, all the days of his vain life,
which he &s;pendeth as a &s;hadow?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="197">
An exten&s;ive contemplation of human
affairs, will incline us to this conclu&s;ion,
that among the different conditions and
ranks of men, the balance of happine&s;s
is pre&s;erved in a great mea&s;ure equal; and
that the high and the low, the rich and
the poor, approach, in point of real enjoy|ment,
much nearer to each other, than is
commonly imagined. In the lot of man,
mutual compen&s;ations, both of plea&s;ure
and of pain, univer&s;ally take place. Pro|vidence
never intended, that any &s;tate
here &s;hould be either completely happy,
or entirely mi&s;erable. If the feelings of
plea&s;ure are more numerous, and more
lively, in the higher departments of life,
&s;uch al&s;o are tho&s;e of pain. If greatne&s;s
flatters our vanity, it multiplies our dan|gers.
If opulence increa&s;es our gratifi|cations,
it increa&s;es, in the &s;ame propor|tion,
our de&s;ires and demands. If the
poor are confined to a more narrow cir|cle,
yet within that circle lie mo&s;t of
tho&s;e natural &s;atisfactions, which, after
all the refinements of art, are found to
<PB N="189" REF="198">
be the mo&s;t genuine and true.&mdash;In a
&s;tate, therefore, where there is neither &s;o
much to be coveted on the one hand, nor
to be dreaded on the other, as at fir&s;t ap|pears,
how &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive ought we to be to
the di&s;po&s;al of Providence! how temper|ate
in our de&s;ires and pur&s;uits! how
much more attentive to pre&s;erve our vir|tue,
and to improve our minds, than to
gain the doubtful and equivocal advan|tages
of worldly pro&s;perity!&mdash;But now,
laying a&s;ide the con&s;ideration of Haman's
great crimes; laying a&s;ide his high pro|&s;perity;
viewing him &s;imply as a man,
let us ob&s;erve from his hi&s;tory,</P>
<P>III. How weak human nature is, which,
in the ab&s;ence of real, is thus prone to
create to it&s;elf imaginary woes. <HI>All this
availeth me nothing, &s;o long as I &s;ee Morde|cai
the few &s;itting at the King's gate.</HI>&mdash;
What was it, O Haman! to thee, though
Mordecai had continued to &s;it there, and
neglected to do thee homage? Would the
banquet have been on that account the
<PB N="190" REF="199">
le&s;s magnificent, thy palace le&s;s &s;plendid,
or thy retinue le&s;s numerous? Could the
di&s;re&s;pect of an ob&s;cure &s;tranger di&s;ho|nour
the favourite of a mighty King? In
the mid&s;t of a thou&s;sand &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive cour|tiers,
was one &s;ullen countenance an ob|ject
worthy of drawing thy notice, or of
troubling thy repo&s;e?&mdash;Alas! in Haman
we behold too ju&s;t a picture of what of|ten
pa&s;&s;es within our&s;elves. We never
know what it is to be long at ea&s;e. Let
the world cea&s;e from changing around us.
Let external things keep that &s;ituation in
which we mo&s;t wi&s;h them to remain; yet
&s;omewhat from within &s;hall &s;oon ari&s;e, to
di&s;turb our happine&s;s. A <HI>Mordeaci ap|pears,</HI>
or &s;eems to appear, <HI>&s;itting at the
gate.</HI> Some vexation, which our fancy
Has either entirely created, or at lea&s;t has
unrea&s;onably aggravated, corrodes us in
&s;ecret; and until that be removed, all
that we enjoy <HI>availeth us nothing.</HI> Thus,
while we are ince&s;&s;antly complaining of
the vanity and the evils of human life,
we make that vanity, and we increa&s;e
<PB N="191" REF="200">
tho&s;e evils. Un&s;killed in the art of extract|ing
happine&s;s from the objects around us,
our ingenuity &s;olely appears in convert|ing
them into mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Nor let it be thought that troubles of
this kind are incident only to the great
and the mighty. Though they, perhaps,
from the intemperance of their pa&s;&s;ions,
are peculiarly expo&s;ed to them, yet the
di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf belongs to human nature,
and &s;preads through all ranks. In the
humble, and &s;eemingly quiet &s;hade of
private life, di&s;content broods over its
imaginary &s;orrows; preys upon the citi|zen,
no le&s;s than upon the courtier; and
often teems with pa&s;&s;ions, equally malig|nant
in the cottage and in the palace.
Having once &s;eized the mind, it tinges
with its own black colour every &s;ur|rounding
object; it every where &s;earches
out materials for it&s;elf; and in no directi|on
more frequently employs its unhappy
activity, than in creating divi&s;ions among&s;t
mankind, and in magnifying &s;light pro|vocations
into mortal injuries. Tho&s;e &s;elf-created
<PB N="192" REF="201">
created mi&s;eries, imaginary in the cau&s;e,
but real in the &s;uffering, will be found to
form a proportion of human evils, not
inferiour, either in &s;everity or in number,
to all that we endure from the unavoid|able
calamities of life. In &s;ituations where
much comfort might be enjoyed, this
man's &s;uperiority, and that man's ne|glect,
our jealou&s;y of a friend, our hatred
of a rival, an imagined affront, or a mi&s;|taken
point of honour, allow us no re|po&s;e.
Hence, di&s;cords in families, ani|mo&s;ities
among friends, and wars among
nations. Hence, Haman mi&s;erable in the
mid&s;t of all that greatne&s;s could be&s;tow.
Hence, multitudes in the mo&s;t ob&s;cure
&s;tations, for whom Providence &s;eemed to
have prepared a quiet life, no le&s;s eager
in their petty broils, nor le&s;s tormented by
their pa&s;&s;ions, than if princely honours
were the prize for which they contended.</P>
<P>FROM this train of ob&s;ervation, which
the Text has &s;ugge&s;ted, can we avoid re|flecting
upon the di&s;order in which hu|man
<PB N="193" REF="202">
nature plainly appears at pre&s;ent to
lie? We have beheld, in Haman, the pic|ture
of that mi&s;ery which ari&s;es from evil
pa&s;&s;ions; of that unhappine&s;s, which is
incident to the highe&s;t pro&s;perity; of that
di&s;content, which is common to every
&s;tate. Whether we con&s;ider him as a
bad man, a pro&s;perous man, or &s;imply
as a man, in every light we behold rea|&s;on
too weak for pa&s;&s;ion. This is the
&s;ource of the reigning evil; this is the
root of the univer&s;al di&s;ea&s;e. The &s;tory
of Haman only &s;hows us what human
nature has, too generally, appeared to
be, in every age. Hence, when we read
the hi&s;tory of nations, what do we read
but the hi&s;tory of the follies and crimes
of men? We may dignify tho&s;e recorded
tran&s;actions, by calling them the intrigues
of &s;tate&s;men, and the exploits of conquer|ors;
but they are, in truth, no other than
the efforts of di&s;content to e&s;cape from its
mi&s;ery, and the &s;truggles of contending
pa&s;&s;ions among unhappy men. The hi|&s;tory
of mankind has ever been a conti|nued
<PB N="194" REF="203">
tragedy; the world, a great theatre
exhibiting the &s;ame repeated &s;cene, of the
follies of men &s;hooting forth into guilt,
and of their pa&s;&s;ions fermenting, by a
quick proce&s;s, into mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>But can we believe, that the nature of
man came forth in this &s;tate from the
hands of its gracious Creator? Did he
frame this world, and &s;tore it with in|habitants,
&s;olely that it might be re|pleni&s;hed
with crimes and misfortunes?
&mdash;In the moral, as well as in the natural
world, we may plainly di&s;cern the &s;igns
of &s;ome violent convul&s;ion, which has
&s;hattered the original workman&s;hip of the
Almighty. Amid&s;t this wreck of human
nature, traces &s;till remain which indicate
its Author. Tho&s;e high powers of con|&s;cience
and rea&s;on, that capacity for hap|pine&s;s,
that ardour of enterprize, that
glow of affection, which often break
through the gloom of human vanity and
guilt, are like the &s;cattered columns, the
broken arches, and de&s;faced &s;culptures of
&s;ome fallen temple, who&s;e ancient &s;plen|dour
<PB N="195" REF="204">
appears amid&s;t its ruins. So con|&s;picuous
in human nature are tho&s;e cha|racters,
both of a high origin, and of a de|graded
&s;tate, that, by many religious fects
throughout the earth, they have been &s;een
and confe&s;&s;ed. A tradition &s;eems to have
pervaded almo&s;t all nations, that the hu|man
race had either through &s;ome of|fence
forfeited, or through &s;ome misfor|tune
lo&s;t, that &s;tation of primaeval honour
which they once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. But while,
from this doctrine, ill under&s;tood, and in|volved
in many fabulous tales, the nati|ons
wandering in Pagan darkne&s;s could
draw no con&s;equences that were ju&s;t;
while, totally ignorant of the nature of
the di&s;ea&s;e, they &s;ought in vain for the
remedy; the &s;ame divine revelation which
has informed us in what manner our apo|&s;tacy
aro&s;e, from the abu&s;e of our rational
powers, has in&s;tructed us al&s;o how we may
be re&s;tored to virtue, and to happine&s;s.</P>
<P>LET us, therefore, &s;tudy to improve
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which this revelation af|fords,
<PB N="196" REF="205">
for the re&s;toration of our nature,
and the recovery of our felicity. With
humble and grateful minds, let us apply
to tho&s;e medicinal &s;prings which it hath
opened for curing the di&s;orders of our
heart and pa&s;&s;ions. In this view, let us,
with reverence, look up to that Divine
Per&s;onage, who de&s;cended into this world
on purpo&s;e to be <HI>the light, and the life of
men;</HI> who came, in the fulne&s;s of grace
and truth, to <HI>repair the de&s;olations of many
generations,</HI> to re&s;tore order among the
works of God, and to rai&s;e up a <HI>new
earth, and new heavens, wherein righteou&s;|ne&s;s
&s;hould dwell for ever.</HI> Under his
tuition let us put our&s;elves; and, amid&s;t
the &s;torms of pa&s;&s;ion to which we are here
expo&s;ed, and the &s;lippery paths which we
are left to tread, never tru&s;t pre&s;umptu|ou&s;ly
to our own under&s;tanding. Thank|ful
that a Heavenly Conductor vouch&s;afes
his aid, let us earne&s;tly pray, that from
him may de&s;cend divine light to guide
our &s;teps, and divine &s;trength to fortify
our minds. Let us pray, that his grace
<PB N="197" REF="206">
may keep us from all intemperate pa&s;|&s;ions,
and mi&s;taken pur&s;uits of plea&s;ure;
that, whether it &s;hall be his will to give
or to deny us earthly pro&s;perity, he may
ble&s;s us with a calm, a &s;ound, and well
regulated mind; may give us modera|tion
in &s;ucce&s;s, and fortitude under di&s;ap|pointment;
and may enable us &s;o to take
warning from the crimes and mi&s;eries of
others, as to e&s;cape the &s;nares of guilt.</P>
<P>WHILE we thus maintain a due de|pendence
on God, let us al&s;o exert our|&s;elves
with care in acting our own part.
From the whole of what has been &s;aid,
this great inference ari&s;es, that the hap|pine&s;s
of every man depends more upon
the &s;tate of his own mind, than upon any
one external circum&s;tancc; nay, more than
upon all external things put together. We
have &s;een, that inordinate pa&s;&s;ions are the
great di&s;turbers of life; and that, unle&s;s
we po&s;&s;e&s;s a good con&s;cience, and a well|governed
mind, di&s;content will bla&s;t eve|ry
enjoyment, and the highe&s;t pro&s;perity
<PB N="198" REF="207">
will prove only di&s;gui&s;ed mi&s;ery. Fix
then this conclu&s;ion in your minds, that
the de&s;truction of your virtue, is the de|&s;truction
of your peace. <HI>Keep thy heart
with all diligence;</HI> govern it with the
greate&s;t care; <HI>for out of it are the i&s;&s;ues
of life.</HI> In no &s;tation, in no period, think
your&s;elves &s;ecure from the dangers which
&s;pring from your pa&s;&s;ions. Every age,
and every &s;tation, they be&s;et; from youth
to grey hairs, and from the pea&s;ant to
the prince.</P>
<P>At your fir&s;t &s;etting out in life, e&s;pe|cially,
when yet unacquainted with the
world and its &s;hares, when every plea&s;ure
enchants with its &s;mile, and every object
&s;hines with the glo&s;s of novelty; beware
of the &s;educing appearances which &s;ur|round
you, and recollect what others
have &s;uffered from the power of head|&s;trong
de&s;ire. If you allow any pa&s;&s;ion,
even though ranked among tho&s;e which
are innocent, to acquire an ab&s;olute a&s;|cendant,
your inward peace will be im|paired.
But if any, which have the taint
<PB N="199" REF="208">
of guilt, take early po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your
mind, you may date from that moment
the ruin of your tranquillity. Nor with
the &s;ea&s;on of youth does the peril end.
To the impetuo&s;ity of youthful de&s;ire,
&s;ucceed the more &s;ober, but no le&s;s dan|gerous,
attachments of advancing years;
when the pa&s;&s;ions which are connected
with intere&s;t end ambition, begin their
reign, and too frequently extend their
malignant influence, even over tho&s;e pe|riods
of life which ought to be mo&s;t tran|quil.
From the fir&s;t to the la&s;t of man's
abode on earth, the di&s;cipline mu&s;t never
be relaxed, of guarding the heart from the
dominion of pa&s;&s;ion. Eager pa&s;&s;ions, and
violent de&s;ires, were not made for man.
They exceed his &s;phere. They find no
adequate objects on earth; and of cour&s;e
can be productive of nothing but mi&s;ery.
The certain con&s;equence of indulging
them is, that there &s;hall come an evil
day, when the angui&s;h of di&s;appoint|ment
&s;hall drive us to acknowledge, that
all which we <HI>enjoy availeth us nothing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="209">
You are not to imagine, that the warn|ings
which I have given in this di&s;cour&s;e,
are applicable only to the ca&s;e of &s;uch
&s;ignal offenders as he was, of whom the
Text treats. Think not, as I am afraid
too many do, that, becau&s;e your pa&s;&s;i|ons
have not hurried you into atrocious
deeds, they have therefore wrought no
mi&s;chief, and have left no &s;ting behind
them. By a continued &s;eries of loo&s;e,
though apparently trivial, gratifications,
the heart is often as thoroughly corrupt|ed,
as by the commi&s;&s;ion of any one of
tho&s;e enormous crimes which &s;pring from
great ambition, or great revenge. Habit
gives the pa&s;&s;ions &s;trength, while the ab|&s;ence
of glaring guilt &s;eemingly ju&s;tifies
them; and, unawakened by remor&s;e, the
&s;inner proceeds in his cour&s;e, till he wax
bold in guilt, and become ripe for ruin.
For, by gradual and latent &s;teps, the de|&s;truction
of our virtue advances. Did
the evil unvail it&s;elf at the beginning:
Did the &s;torm which is to overthrow our
peace, di&s;cover, as it ro&s;e, all its horrours,
<PB N="201" REF="210">
precautions would more frequently be
takcn again&s;t it. But we are impercep|tibly
betrayed; and from one licentious
attachment, one criminal pa&s;&s;ion, are,
by a train of con&s;equences, drawn on
to another, till the government of our
minds is irrecoverably lo&s;t. The enti|cing
and the odious pa&s;&s;ions are, in this
re&s;pect, &s;imilar in their proce&s;s; and,
though by different roads, conduct at
la&s;t to the &s;ame i&s;&s;ue. David, when he
fir&s;t beheld Bath&s;heba, did not plan the
death of Uriah. Haman was not deli|vered
up all at once to the madne&s;s of
revenge. His pa&s;&s;ions ro&s;e with, the ri&s;|ing
tide of pro&s;perity; and pride com|pleated
what pro&s;perity began. What
was originally no more than di&s;plea&s;ure
at Mordecai's di&s;re&s;pect, increa&s;ed with
every invitation he received to the ban|quet
of the King; till it impelled him to
devi&s;e the &s;laughter of a whole nation,
and ended in a degree of rage, which
confounded his rea&s;on, and hurried him
to ruin. In this manner, every crimi|nal
<PB N="202" REF="211">
pa&s;&s;ion, in its progre&s;s, &s;wells and
blackens; and what was at fir&s;t a &s;mall
cloud, &s;uch as the Prophet's &s;ervant &s;aw,
<HI>no bigger</HI> than a man's hand, ri&s;ing from the

<P>TH E mea&s;ure according to which
knowledge is di&s;pen&s;ed to man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VIII.</NOTE> af|fords
con&s;picuous proofs of divine wi&s;|dom.
In many in&s;tances we clearly per|ceive,
that either more or le&s;s would have
proved detrimental to his &s;tate; that en|tire
ignorance would have deprived him
of proper motives to action; and that
complete di&s;covery would have rai&s;ed
him to a &s;phere too high for his pre|&s;ent
<PB N="204" REF="213">
powers. He is, therefore, permitted
to <HI>know only in part; and to &s;ee through
a gla&s;s, darkly.</HI> He is left in that &s;tate
of conjecture, and partial information,
which, though it may occa&s;ionally &s;ub|ject
him to di&s;tre&s;s, yet, on the whole, con|duces
mo&s;t to his improvement; which
affords him knowledge &s;ufficient for the
purpo&s;es of virtue, and of active life,
without di&s;turbing the operations of his
mind, by a light too bright and daz|zling.
This evidently holds, with re&s;pect
to that degree of concealment which now
covers the great laws of Nature, the de|crees
of the Supreme Being, the &s;tate of
the invi&s;ible world, the future events
of our own life, and the thoughts and
de&s;igns which pa&s;s within the brea&s;ts of

<P>But there is an ignorance of another
kind, with re&s;pect to which the applica|tion
of this remark may appear more du|bious;
the ignorance under which men
labour concerning their happine&s;s in the
pre&s;ent life, and the means of attaining
<PB N="205" REF="214">
it. If there be foundation for Solomon's
complaint in the Text, <HI>who knoweth what

may be thought inevitably to fol|low,
that the <HI>days of his life</HI> mu&s;t. be <HI>vain</HI>
in every &s;en&s;e; not only becau&s;e they are
fleeting, but becau&s;e they are empty too,
like the <HI>&s;hadow.</HI> For, to what purpo&s;e
are all his labours in the pur&s;uit of an
object, which it is not in his power to
discover or a&s;certain?&mdash;Let us then &s;eri|ou&s;ly
enquire, what account can be given
of our pre&s;ent ignorance, re&s;pecting what
is good for us in this life; whether no|thing
be left, but only to wander in
uncertainty amid&s;t this darkne&s;s, and to
lament it as the &s;ad con&s;equence of our
fallen &s;tate; or whether &s;uch in&s;tructi|ons
may not be derived from it, as give
ground for acknowledging, that by this,
as by all its other appointments, the wi&s;|dom
of Providence brings real good out
of &s;eeming evil. I &s;hall, in order to de|termine
this point, fir&s;t, endeavour to illu|&s;trate
the doctrine of the Text, that we know
<PB N="206" REF="215">
not, or at mo&s;t know imperfectly, <HI>what
is good for us in this life:</HI> I &s;hall next
explain the cau&s;es to which this defect
in our knowledge is owing: And then,
&s;hall &s;how the purpo&s;es which it was in|tended
to &s;erve, and the effects which it
ought to produce on our conduct.</P>
<P>THE whole hi&s;tory of mankind &s;eems
a comment on the doctrine of the Text.
When we review the cour&s;e of human
affairs, one of the fir&s;t objects which eve|ry
where attracts our notice is, the mi&s;|taken
judgment of men concerning their
own intere&s;t. That <HI>&s;ore evil,</HI> which So|lomon
long ago remarked with re&s;pect to
riches, of their being <HI>kept by the owners
thereof to their hurt,</HI> takes place equally
with re&s;pect to dominion and power, and
all the &s;plendid objects and high &s;tati|ons
of life. We every day behold men
climbing, by painful &s;teps, to that co|veted
height, which, in the end, renders
their fall more &s;evere, and their ruin
more con&s;picuous. But it is not to high
<PB N="207" REF="216">
&s;tations that the doctrine of the Text is
limited. In the crimes by which too of|ten
the&s;e are gained, and in the misfor|tunes
which they afterwards bring forth,
the greater part of every audience may
think them&s;elves little concerned. Leav|ing
&s;uch themes, therefore, to the poet
and the hi&s;torian, let us come nearer to
our&s;elves, and &s;urvey the ordinary walk
of life.</P>
<P>Around us, we every where behold a
bu&s;y multitude. Re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y in
their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, they are ince&s;&s;ant|ly
employed in accompli&s;hing a change
of it; and, as &s;oon as their wi&s;h is ful|filled,
we di&s;cern, by their behaviour, that
they are as di&s;&s;atisfied as they were be|fore.
Where they expected to have found
a paradi&s;e, they find a de&s;ert. The man
of bu&s;ine&s;s pines for lei&s;ure. The lei&s;ure
for which he had longed, proves an irk|&s;ome
gloom; and, through want of em|ployment,
he langui&s;hies, &s;ickens, and dies.
The man of retirement fancies no &s;tate to
be &s;o happy, as that of active life. But
<PB N="208" REF="217">
he has not engaged long in the tumults
and conte&s;ts of the world, until he finds
cau&s;e to look back with regret on the calm
hours of his former privacy and retreat,
Beauty, wit, eloquence, and fame, are
eagerly coveted by men in every rank of
life. They are the parent's fonde&s;t wi&s;h for
his child; the ambition of the young, and
the admiration of the old. And yet, in what
numberle&s;s in&s;tances have they proved,
to tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, no other than
&s;hining &s;nares; &s;eductions to vice, in&s;ti|gations
to folly, and, in the end, &s;ources
of mi&s;ery? Comfortably might their days.
have pa&s;&s;ed, had they been le&s;s con&s;picu|ous.
But the di&s;tinctions which brought
them forth to noticc, conferred &s;plendour,
and withdrew happine&s;s. Long life is,
of all others, the mo&s;t general, and &s;eem|ingly
the mo&s;t innocent, object of de&s;ire.
With re&s;pect to this too, we &s;o frequently
err, that it would have been a ble&s;&s;ing
to many to have had their wi&s;h denied.
There was a period, when they might
have quitted the &s;tage with honour, and
<PB N="209" REF="218">
in peace. But by living too long, they
outlived their reputation; outlived their
family, their friends, and comforts; and
reaped nothing from the continuance of
days, except to feel the pre&s;&s;ure of age,
to ta&s;te the dregs of life, and to behold a
wider compa&s;s of human mi&s;ery.</P>
<P><HI>Man walketh in a vain &s;hew.</HI> His fears
are often as vain as his wi&s;hes. As what
flattered him in expectation, frequently
wounds him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; &s;o the event
to which he looked forward with an
anxious and fearful eye, has often, when
it arrived, laid its terrours a&s;ide; nay,
has brought in its train unexpected ble&s;|&s;ings.
Both good and evil are beheld at
a di&s;tance, through a per&s;pective which
deceives. The colours of objects when
nigh, are entirely different from what they
appeared when viewed in futurity.</P>
<P>THE fact then being undoubtedly cer|tain,
that it is common for men to be
deceived in their pro&s;pects of happine&s;s,
let us next enquire into the cau&s;es of that
<PB N="210" REF="219">
deception. Let us attend to tho&s;e peculiar
circum&s;tances in our &s;tate, which render
us &s;uch incompetent judges of future good
or evil in this life.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, We are not &s;ufficiently acquainted
with our&s;elves, to for$&s;ee our future feel|ings.
We judge by the &s;en&s;ations of the
pre&s;ent moment; and, in the fervour of
de&s;ire, pronounce confidently concerning
the de&s;ired object. But we reflect not,
that our minds, like our bodies, undergo
great alteration from the &s;ituations into
which they are thrown, and the progre&s;|&s;ive
&s;tages of life through which they
pa&s;s. Hence, concerning any condition
which is yet untried, we conjecture with
much uncertainty. In imagination, we
carry our pre&s;ent wants, inclinations, and
&s;entiments, into the &s;tate of life to which
we a&s;pire. But no &s;ooner have we entered
on it, than our &s;entiments and inclina|tions
change. New wants and de&s;ires
ari&s;e; new objects are required to gratify
them; and by con&s;equence our old di&s;|&s;atisfaction
returns; and the void, which
<PB N="211" REF="220">
was to have been filled, remains as great
as it was before.</P>
<P>But, next, &s;uppo&s;ing our knowledge of
our&s;elves &s;ufficient to direct us in the
choice of happine&s;s, yet &s;till we are liable
to err, from our ignorance of the con|nections
which &s;ub&s;i&s;t between our own
condition and that of others. No indi|vidual
can be happy, unle&s;s the circum|&s;tances
of tho&s;e around him be &s;o adju&s;ted
as to con&s;pire with his intere&s;t. For, in
human &s;ociety, no happine&s;s or mi&s;ery
&s;tands unconnected, and independent.
Our fortunes are interwoven by threads
innumerable. We touch one another on
all &s;ides. One man's misfortune or &s;uc|ce&s;s,
his wi&s;dom or his folly, often, by its
con&s;equences, reaches through multitudes.
Such a &s;y&s;tem is far too complicated for
our arrangement. It requires adju&s;tments
beyond our &s;kill and power. It is a chaos
of events, into which our eye cannot pierce;
and is capable of regulation, only by him
who perceives at one glance the relation
of each to all.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="221">
Farther, As we are ignorant of the
events which will ari&s;e from the combi|nation
of our circum&s;tances with tho&s;e of
others, &s;o we are equally ignorant of the
influence which the pre&s;ent incidents of
our life may have upon tho&s;e which are
future. The important que&s;tion is not,
What is good for a man one day; but
what is <HI>good for him all the days of his
life?</HI> Not, what will yield him a few &s;cat|tered
plea&s;ures; but what will render his
life happy on the whole amount? And is he
able to an&s;wer that que&s;tion, who knoweth
not what <HI>one day may bring forth;</HI> who
cannot tell, whether the events of it may
not branch out into con&s;equences, which
&s;hall a&s;&s;ume a direction quite oppo&s;ite to
that in which they &s;et forth, and &s;hall
&s;pread them&s;elves over all his life to come?
There is not any pre&s;ent moment that is
unconnected with &s;ome future one. The
life of every man is a continued chain of
incidents, each link of which hangs upon
the former. The tran&s;ition from cau&s;e to
effect, from event to event, is often car|ried
<PB N="213" REF="222">
on by &s;ecret &s;teps, which our fore|&s;ight
cannot divine, and our &s;agacity is
unable to trace. Evil may, at &s;ome fu|ture
period, bring forth good; and good
may bring forth evil, both equally unex|pected.
Had the Patriarch, Jo&s;eph, con|tinued
to loiter under his father's fond
indulgence, he might have lived an ob|&s;cure

made him the ruler of Egypt, and the &s;a|viour

<P>La&s;tiy, Suppo&s;ing every other incapa|city
to be removed, our ignorance of the
dangers to which our &s;piritual &s;tate is
expo&s;ed, would di&s;qualify us for judging
foundly concerning our true happine&s;s.
Higher intere&s;ts, than tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent
world, are now depending. All that is
done or &s;uffered by us here, ultimately
refers to that immortal world, for which
good men are trained up, under the care
of an Almighty Parent. We are as in|competent
judges of the mea&s;ures ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to be pur&s;ued for this end, as
<PB N="214" REF="223">
children are, of the proper conduct to be
held in their education. We fore&s;ee the
dangers of our &s;piritual, &s;till le&s;s than
we do tho&s;e of our natural &s;tate; becau&s;e
we are le&s;s attentive to trace them. We
are &s;till more expo&s;ed to vice than to mi|&s;ery;
becau&s;e the confidence which we
place in our virtue, is yet wor&s;e founded
than that which we place in our wi&s;dom.
Can you e&s;teem him pro&s;perous, who is
rai&s;ed to a &s;ituation which flatters his pa&s;|&s;ions,
but which corrupts his principles,
di&s;orders his temper, and, finally, over&s;ets
his virtue? In the ardour of pur&s;uit, how
little are the&s;e effects fore&s;een? And yet,
how often are they accompli&s;hed, by a
change of condition? Latent corruptions
are called forth; &s;eeds of guilt are quick|ened
into life; a growth of crimes ari&s;es,
which, had it not been for the fatal cul|ture
of pro&s;perity, would never have &s;een
the light. How often is man, boa&s;tful as
he is of rea&s;on, merely the creature of his
fortune; formed, and moulded, by the in|cidents
of his life!&mdash;Hazael, when yet

Hazael, <HI>that he &s;hould do the&s;e things?</HI>
But no &s;ooner was he cloathed with the
coveted purple, than it &s;eemed to taint
his nature. He committed the crimes of
which, at a di&s;tance, he believed him&s;elf
incapable; and became the bloody ty|rant,
who&s;e character his &s;oul once ab|horred<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">2 Kings viii. 12, 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUCH then at pre&s;ent is man; thus in|capable
of pronouncing with certainty
concerning his own good or evil. Of
futurity he di&s;cerns little; and even that
little he &s;ees through a cloud. Ignorant
of the alteration which his &s;entiments
and de&s;ires will undergo from new &s;itu|ations
in life; ignorant of the con&s;e|quences
which will follow from the com|bination
of his circum&s;tances with tho&s;e

<PB N="216" REF="225">
influence which the pre&s;ent may have on
the future events of his life; ignorant
of the effect which a change of condition
may produce on his moral character, and
his eternal intere&s;ts; How can he know
<HI>what is good for him all the days of his
vain life, which be &s;pendeth as a &s;hadow?</HI></P>
<P>In&s;tead of only lamenting this igno|rance,
let us, in the la&s;t place, con&s;ider how
it ought to be improved; what duties it
&s;ugge&s;ts, and what wi&s;e ends it was in|tended
by Providence to promote.</P>
<P>I. LET this doctrine teach us to pro|ceed
with caution and circum&s;pection,
through a world, where evil &s;o frequent|ly
lurks under the form of good. To be
humble and mode&s;t in opinion, to be vi|gilant
and attentive in conduct, to di&s;|tru&s;t
fair appearances, and to re&s;train ra&s;h
de&s;ires, are in&s;tructions which the dark|ne&s;s
of our pre&s;ent &s;tate &s;hould &s;trongly
inculcate. God hath appointed our &s;itu|ation
to be &s;o ambiguous, in order both
to call forth the exertion of tho&s;e intelli|gent
<PB N="217" REF="226">
powers which he hath given us, and
to enforce our dependance on his gracious
aid. <HI>It is not in man that walketh, to direct
his &s;teps.</HI> Surrounded with &s;o many be|wildering
paths, among which the wi&s;e&s;t
are ready to &s;tray, how earne&s;tly &s;hould
we implore, and how thankfully &s;hould we
receive, that divine illumination, which is
promi&s;ed in &s;eripture to the pious and
the humble! <HI>The &s;ecret of the Lord is with
them that fear him. He will guide them
with his coun&s;el. He will teach them the
way that they &s;hould chu&s;e.</HI> But what
mu&s;t be the fate of him, who, amid&s;t all
the dangers attending human conduct,
neither looks up to Heaven for direction,
nor properly exerts that rea&s;on which
God hath given him? If to the mo&s;t
diligent enquirer, it proves &s;o difficult a
ta&s;k to di&s;tingui&s;h true good from tho&s;e
fallacious appearances with which it is
ever blended, how &s;hould he di&s;cover it,
who brings neither patience nor attenti|on
to the &s;earch, who applies to no other
coun&s;ellor than pre&s;ent plea&s;ure, and, with
<PB N="218" REF="227">
a ra&s;h and credulous mind, delivers him|&s;elf
up to every &s;ugge&s;tion of de&s;ire?</P>
<P>This admonition I particularly direct
to tho&s;e, who are in a period of life too
often characterized by forward pre&s;ump|tion,
and headlong pur&s;uit. The &s;elf-con|ceit
of the young, is the great &s;ource of
tho&s;e dangers to which they are expo&s;ed;
and it is peculiarly unfortunate, that the
age which &s;tands mo&s;t in need of the
coun&s;el of the wi&s;e, &s;hould be the mo&s;t
prone to contemn it. Confident in the opi|nions
which they adopt, and in the mea|&s;ures
which they pur&s;ue, they &s;eem as if
they under&s;tood Solomon to &s;ay, not,
<HI>Who knoweth,</HI> but, Who is ignorant of
<HI>what is good for man all the days of his
life?</HI> The bli&s;s to be aimed at, is, in
their opinion, fully apparent. It is not
the danger of mi&s;take, but the failure of
&s;ucce&s;s, which they dread. Activity to
&s;eize, not &s;agacity to di&s;cern, is the only
requi&s;ite which they value.&mdash;How long
&s;hall it be, ere the fate of your predece&s;|fors
in the &s;ame cour&s;e, teach you wi&s;|dom?
<PB N="219" REF="228">
How loug &s;hall the experience of
all ages, continue to li&s;t its voice to you
in vain? Beholding the ocean on which
you are embarked, covered with wrecks,
are not tho&s;e fatal &s;ignals &s;ufficient to ad|moni&s;h
you of the hidden rock? If, in
Paradi&s;e it&s;elf, there was a tree which
bare fruit fair to the eye, but mortal
in its effects, how much more, in this
fallen &s;tate, may &s;uch deceiving appear|ances
be expected to abound? The whole
&s;tate of Nature, is now become a &s;cenc
of delu&s;ion to the &s;en&s;ual mind. Hardly
any thing is what it appears to be: And
what flatters mo&s;t, is always farthe&s;t from
reality. There are voices which &s;ing a|round
you; but who&s;e &s;trains allure to
ruin. There is a banquet &s;pread, where
poi&s;on is in every di&s;h. There is a couch
which invites you to repo&s;e; but to &s;lum|ber
upon it, is death. In &s;uch a &s;itua|tion,
<HI>be not high minded, but fear.</HI> Let
&s;obriety temper your unwary ardour.
Let mode&s;ty check your ra&s;h pre&s;ump|tion.
Let wi&s;dom be the offspring of
<PB N="220" REF="229">
reflection now, rather than the fruit of
bitter experience hereafter.</P>
<P>II. LET our ignorance of what is good
or evil, correct anxiety about worldly &s;uc|ces.
As $a&s;hne&s;s is the vice of youth, the
oppo&s;ite extreme of immoderate care is
the vice of advancing years. The doc|trine
which I have illu&s;trated, is equally
adapted for checking both. Since we are
&s;o often betrayed into evil, by the mi&s;|taken
pur&s;uit of good, care and attention
are requi&s;ite, both in forming our choice,
and conducting our pur&s;uit; but &s;ince
our attention and care are liable to be &s;o
often fru&s;trated, they &s;hould never ri&s;e
into trouble of mind.</P>
<P>The ignorance in which we are le&s;t con|cerning
good and evil, is not &s;uch as to
&s;uper&s;ede prudence in conduct: For wi&s;|dom
is &s;till found to <HI>excel folly, as far as
light excelleth darkne&s;s.</HI> But it is that de|gree
of uncertainty which ought to render
us temperate in pur&s;uit; which ought
to calm the perturbation of hope and fear,
<PB N="221" REF="230">
and to cure the pain of anxiety. Anxiety
is the poi&s;on of human life. It is the pa|rent
of many &s;ins, and of more mi&s;eries.
In a world where every thing is &s;o doubt|ful;
where you may &s;ucceed in your
wi&s;h, and be mi&s;erable; where you may
be di&s;appointed, and be ble&s;t through that
di&s;appointment; what means this re&s;tle&s;s
&s;tir and commotion of mind? Can your
&s;ollicitude alter the cour&s;e, or unravel the
intricacy of human events? Can your
curio&s;ity pierce through the cloud which
God hath made impenetrable to mortal
eye?&mdash;To provide again&s;t every apparent
danger, by the employment of the mo&s;t
promi&s;ing means, is the office of wi&s;dom.
But at this point, wi&s;dom &s;tops. It com|mands
you to retire, after you have done
all that was incumbent on you, and to
po&s;&s;e&s;s your mind in peace. By going be|yond
this point; by giving your&s;elves up
to immoderate concern about unknown
events, you can do nothing to advance
your &s;ucce&s;s, and you do much to ruin
your peace. You plant within your brea&s;t
<PB N="222" REF="231">
the thorn which is long to gall you. To
the vanity of life, you add a vexation of
&s;pirit, which is wholly of your own crea|tion,
not of God's appointment. For the
dubious goods of this world were never
de&s;igned by God to rai&s;e &s;uch eager at|tachment.
They were given to man for
his occa&s;ional refre&s;hment, not for his
chief felicity. By &s;etting an exce&s;&s;ive va|lue
upon objects which were intended on|ly
for your &s;econdary regard, you change
their nature. Seeking more &s;atisfaction
from them than they are able to afford,
you receive le&s;s than they might give.
From a mi&s;taken care to &s;ecure your hap|pine&s;s,
you bring upon your&s;elves certain
mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>III. LET our ignorance of good and evil,
determine us to follow Providence, and to
re&s;ign our&s;elves to God. One of the mo&s;t
important le&s;&s;ons which can be given to
man, is re&s;ignation to his Maker; and no|thing
inculcates it more, than the experi|ence
of his own inability to guide him|&s;elf.
<PB N="223" REF="232">
&mdash;You know not what is good for
you, in the future periods of life. But
God perfectly knows it; and if you faith|fully
&s;erve him, you have rea&s;on to believe
that he will always con&s;ult it. Before
him lies the whole &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of events,
which are to fill up your exi&s;tence. It is
in his power, to arrange and model them
at his plea&s;ure; and &s;o to adapt one thing
to another, as to fulfil his promi&s;e of mak|ing
them <HI>all work together for good to
tho&s;e who love him.</HI> Here then, amid&s;t
the agitations of de&s;ire, and the perplexi|ties
of doubt, is one fixed point of re&s;t.
By this let us abide; and di&s;mi&s;s our
anxiety about things uncertain and un|known.
<HI>Acquaint your&s;elves with God, and
be at peace.</HI> Secure the <HI>one thing need|ful.</HI>
Study to acquire an intere&s;t in the
divine favour: And you may &s;afely &s;ur|render
your&s;elves to the divine admini|&s;tration.</P>
<P>When tempted to repine at your con|dition,
reflect how uncertain it is, whether
you &s;hould have been happier in any
<PB N="224" REF="233">
other. Remembering the vanity of many
of your former wi&s;hes, and the fallacy
which you have &s;o often experienced in
your &s;chemes of happine&s;s, be thankful
that you are placed under a wi&s;er direc|tion
than your own. Be not too parti|cular
in your petitions to Heaven, concern|ing
your temporal intere&s;t. Suffer God
to govern the world according to his own
plan; and only pray, that he would be|&s;tow
what his unerring wi&s;dom &s;ees to
be be&s;t for you on the whole. In a word,
<HI>Commit your way unto the Lord. Tru&s;t in
him, and do good.</HI> Follow wherever his
Providence leads; comply with whatever
his will requires; and leave all the re&s;t to
him.</P>
<P>IV. LET our ignorance of what is good
for us in this life, prevent our taking any
unlawful &s;tep, in order to compa&s;s our
mo&s;t favourite de&s;igns. Were the &s;inner
bribed with any certain and unque&s;tion|able
advantage; could the means which
he employs en&s;ure his &s;ucce&s;s, and could
<PB N="225" REF="234">
that &s;ucce&s;s en&s;ure his comfort; he might
have &s;omewhat to offer in apology for de|viating
from the path of virtue. But the
doctrine which I have illu&s;trated, deprives
him of every &s;uch excu&s;e, and places his
folly in the mo&s;t &s;triking light. He climbs
the &s;teep rock, and treads on the edge of
a precipice, in order to catch a &s;hadow.
He has cau&s;e to dread, not only the un|certainty
of the event which he wi&s;hes to
accompli&s;h, but the nature al&s;o of that
event when accompli&s;hed. He is not only
liable to that di&s;appointment of &s;ucce&s;s,
which &s;o often fru&s;trates all the de&s;igns of
men; but liable to a di&s;appointment &s;till
more cruel, that of being &s;ucce&s;sful and
mi&s;erable at once. Riches and plea&s; res
are the chief temptations to criminal deeds.
Yet tho&s;e riches, when obtained, may very
po&s;&s;ibly overwhelm him with unfore&s;een
mi&s;eries. Tho&s;e plea&s;ures may cut &s;hort
his health and life. And is it for &s;uch
doubtful and fallacious rewards, that the
deceiver fills his mouth with lies, the
friend betrays his benefactor, the apo&s;tare
<PB N="226" REF="235">
renounces his faith, and the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in covers
him&s;elf with blood?</P>
<P>Whoever commits a crime, incurs a
certain evil, for a mo&s;t uncertain good.
What will turn to his advantage in the
cour&s;e of this life, he cannot with any a&s;|&s;urance
know. But this he may know, with
full certainty, that by breaking the divine
commandments, he will draw upon his
head that di&s;plea&s;ure of the Almighty
which &s;hall cru&s;h him for ever. The ad|vantages
of this world, even when inno|cently
gained, are uncertain ble&s;&s;ings;
when obtained by criminal means, they
carry a cur&s;e in their bo&s;om. To the
virtuous, they are often no more than
chaff. To the guilty, they arc always
poi&s;on.</P>
<P>V. LET our imperfect knowledge of
what is good or evil, attach us the more
to tho&s;e few things, concerning which
there can be no doubt of their being tru|ly
good. Of temporal things, the cata|logue
of &s;uch as belong to this cla&s;s, it
<PB N="227" REF="236">
mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, is &s;mall. Perhaps the
chief worldly good we &s;hould wi&s;h to
enjoy, is a &s;ound mind in a &s;ound body.
Health and peace, a moderate fortune, and
a few friends, &s;um up all the undoubted
articles of temporal felicity. Wi&s;e was
the man who addre&s;&s;ed this prayer to
God; <HI>Remove far from me vanity and lies.
Give me neither poverty nor riches. Feed
me with food convenient for me. Le&s;t I be
full and deny thee, and &s;ay, who is the Lord?
or le&s;t I be poor and &s;teal, and take the name
of my God in vain</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxx. 8, 9.</NOTE>. He who&s;e wi&s;hes, re|&s;pecting
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of this world, are
the mo&s;t rea&s;onable and bounded, is like|ly
to lead the &s;afe&s;t, and, for that rea&s;on,
the mo&s;t de&s;irable life. By a&s;piring too
high, we frequently mi&s;s the happine&s;s,
which, by a le&s;s ambitious aim, we might
have gained. High happine&s;s on earth, is
rather a picture which the imagination
forms, than a reality which is given to
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of man.</P>
<P>But with regard to &s;piritual felicity, we
are not confined to &s;uch humble views.
<PB N="228" REF="237">
Clear and determinate objects are pro|po&s;ed
to our pur&s;uit; and full &s;cope is
given to the mo&s;t ardent de&s;ire. The for|givene&s;s
of our &s;ins, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
God's holy grace, to guide our life; the
improvement of our minds, in knowledge
and wi&s;dom, in piety and virtue; the
protection and favour of the great Father
of all, of the ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer of man|kind,
and of the Spirit of &s;anctification and
comfort; the&s;e are objects, in the pur&s;uit
of which there is no room for he&s;itation
and di&s;tru&s;t, nor any ground for the que|&s;tion
in my Text, <HI>Who knoweth what is
good for man?</HI> Had Providence &s;pread an
equal ob&s;curity over happine&s;s of every
kind, we might have had &s;ome rea&s;on to
complain of the vanity of our condition.
But we are not left to &s;o hard a fate. The
Son of God hath de&s;cended from heaven,
to be the <HI>Light of the world.</HI> He hath re|moved
that veil which covered true bli&s;s
from the &s;earch of wandering mortals,
and hath taught them the way which
leads to life. Worldly enjoyments are
<PB N="229" REF="238">
&s;hown to be hollow and deceitful, with
an expre&s;s intention to direct their affec|tions
towards tho&s;e which are &s;piritual.
The &s;ame di&s;coveries which dimini&s;h the
value of the one, &s;erve to increa&s;e that of
the other. Finally,</P>
<P>VI. LET our ignorance of what is good
or evil here below, lead our thoughts and
de&s;ires to a better world. I have endea|voured
to vindicate the wi&s;dom of Provi|dence,
by &s;howing the many u&s;eful pur|po&s;es
which this ignorance at pre&s;ent pro|motes.
It &s;erves to check pre&s;umption
and ra&s;hne&s;s, and to enforce a diligent
exertion of our rational powers, joined
with a humble dependance on divine aid.
It moderates eager pa&s;&s;ions re&s;pecting
worldly &s;ucce&s;s. It inculcates re&s;ignation
to the di&s;po&s;al of a Providence which is
much wi&s;er than man. It re&s;trains us
from employing unlawful means in order
to compa&s;s our mo&s;t favourite de&s;igns.
It tends to attach us more clo&s;ely to tho&s;e
things which are unque&s;tionably good.
<PB N="230" REF="239">
It is therefore &s;uch a degree of ignorance,
as &s;uits the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of man
better than more complete information
concerning good and evil.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, the cau&s;es which
render this ob&s;curity nece&s;&s;ary, too plain|ly
indicate a broken and corrupted &s;tate
of human nature. They &s;how this life to
be a &s;tate of trial. They &s;ugge&s;t the ideas
of a land of pilgrimage, not of the hou&s;e
of re&s;t. Low minded and ba&s;e is he, who
a&s;pires to no higher portion; who could
be &s;atisfied to &s;pend his whole exi&s;tence
in cha&s;ing tho&s;e treacherous appearances
of good, which &s;o often mock his pur&s;uit.
What &s;hadow can be more vain, than the
life of the greate&s;t part of mankind? Of
all that eager and bu&s;tling crowd which
we behold on the earth, how few di&s;cover
the path of true happine&s;s? How few can
we find, who&s;e activity has not been mi&s;|employed,
and who&s;e cour&s;e terminates
not in confe&s;&s;ions of di&s;appointment? Is
this the &s;tate, are the&s;e the habitations, to
which a rational &s;pirit, with all its high
<PB N="231" REF="240">
hopes, and great capacities, is to be limited
for ever?&mdash;Let us ble&s;s that God who
hath &s;et higher pro&s;pects before us;
who, by the death and re&s;urrection of his
Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, hath <HI>begotten us to the
lively hope of an inheritance incorruptible,
undefiled, and that fadeth not away, re|&s;erved
in the heavens.</HI> Let us &s;how our|&s;elves
worthy of &s;uch a hope, by <HI>&s;etting
our affections upon the things above, not upon

<P>MUCH communing with them&s;elves
there has always been among man|kind;<NOTE PLACE="marg">S E R M. IX.</NOTE>
though frequently, God knows, to
no purpo&s;e, or to a purpo&s;e wor&s;e than
none. Could we di&s;cover the employments
of men in retirement, how often &s;hould we
find their thoughts occupied with &s;ubjects,
which they would be a&s;hamed to own?
What a large &s;hare have ambition and
avarice, at &s;ome times the gro&s;$e&s;t pa&s;|&s;ions,
and at other times the meane&s;t
trifles, in their &s;olitary mu&s;ings? They
<PB N="234" REF="243">
carry the world, with all its vices, into
their retreat; and may be &s;aid to dwell
in the mid&s;t of the world, even when
they &s;eem to be alone.</P>
<P>This, &s;urely, is not that &s;ort of commun|ing
which the P&s;almi&s;t recommends. For
thi$ is not properly <HI>communing with our
heart,</HI> but rather, holding &s;ecret inter|cour&s;e
with the world. What the P&s;al|mi&s;t
means to recommend, is religious re|collection;
that exerci&s;e of thought which
is connected with the precept given in the
precceding words, to <HI>&s;tand in awe, and &s;in
not.</HI> It is to commune with our&s;elves un|der
the character of &s;piritual and immor|tal
beings; and to <HI>ponder tho&s;e paths of our
feet</HI> which are leading us to eternity. I
&s;hall, in the fir&s;t place, &s;how the advan|tages
of &s;uch &s;erious retirement and me|ditation;
and &s;hall, in the &s;econd place,
point out &s;ome of the principal &s;ubjects
which ought to employ us in our retreat.</P>
<P>The advantages of retiring from the
world, to <HI>commune with our heart,</HI> will be
found to be great, whether we regard our
<PB N="235" REF="244">
happine&s;s in this world, or our prepara|tion
for the world to come.</P>
<P>LET us con&s;ider them, fir&s;t, with re|&s;pect
to our happine&s;s in this world. It
will readily occur to you, that an entire
retreat from worldly affairs is not what
religion require$; nor does it even enjoin
a great retreat from them. Some &s;tations
of life would not permit this; and there
are few &s;tations which render it nece&s;&s;a|ry.
The chief field, both of the duty and
of the improvement of man, lies in active
life. By the graces and virtues which
he exerci&s;es amid&s;t his fellow-creatures,
he is trained up for heaven. A total re|treat
from the world, is &s;o far from be|ing,
according to the doctrine of the Ro|mi&s;h
Church, the perfection of religion,
that, &s;ome particular ca&s;es excepted, it is
no other than the abu&s;e of it.</P>
<P>But, though entire retreat would lay us
a&s;ide from the part for which Providence
chiefly intended us, it is certain, that
without occa&s;ional retreat, we mu&s;t act
<PB N="236" REF="245">
that part very ill. There will be neither
con&s;i&s;tency in the conduct, nor dignity in
the character, of one who &s;ets apart no
&s;hare of his time for meditation and re|flection.
In the heat and bu&s;tle of life,
while pa&s;&s;ion is every moment throwing
fal&s;e colours on the objects around us,
nothing can be viewed in a ju&s;t light.
If you wi&s;h that Rea&s;on &s;hould exert her
native power, you mu&s;t &s;tep a&s;ide from
the crowd, into the cool and &s;ilent &s;hade.
It is there that, with &s;ober and &s;teady eye,
&s;he examines what is good or ill, what is
wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, in human conduct; &s;he
looks back on the pa&s;t, &s;he looks forward
to the future, and forms plans, not for the
pre&s;ent moment only, but for the whole
of life. How &s;hould that man di&s;charge
any part of his duty aright, who never
&s;uffers his pa&s;&s;ions to cool? And how
&s;hould his pa&s;&s;ions cool, who is engaged,
without interruption, in the tumult of
the world? This ince&s;&s;ant &s;tir may be
called, the perpetual drunkenne&s;s of life.
It rai&s;es that eager fermentation of &s;pi|rit,
<PB N="237" REF="246">
which will be ever &s;ending forth the
dangerous fumes of ra&s;hne&s;s and folly.
Whereas he who mingles religious re|treat
with worldly affairs, remains calm,
and ma&s;ter of him&s;elf. He is not whirled
round, and rendered giddy, by the agita|tion
of the world; but, from that &s;acred
retirement, in which he has been conver|&s;ant
among higher objects, comes forth
into the world with manly tranquillity,
fortified by the principles which he has
formed, and prepared for every occur|rence
that may befall.</P>
<P>As he who is unacquainted with retreat
cannot &s;u&s;tain any character with pro|priety,
&s;o neither can he enjoy the world
with any advantage. Of the two cla&s;&s;es
of men who are mo&s;t apt to be negligent
of this duty, the men of plea&s;ure, and the
men of bu&s;ine&s;s, it is hard to &s;ay which,
&s;uffer mo&s;t, in point of enjoyment, from
that neglect. To the former, every mo|ment
appears to be lo&s;t, which partakes
not of the vivacity of amu&s;ement. To
connect one plan of gaiety with another,
<PB N="238" REF="247">
is their &s;ole &s;tudy; till, in a very &s;hort
time, nothing remain but to tread the
&s;ame beaten round; to enjoy what they
have already enjoyed, and to &s;ee what
they have often &s;een. Plea&s;ures thus
drawn to the dregs, become vapid and
ta&s;tele&s;s. What might have plea&s;ed long,
if enjoyed with temperance, and mingled
with retirement, being devoured with
&s;uch eager ha&s;te, &s;peedily &s;urfeits and
di&s;gu&s;ts. Hence, the&s;e are the per&s;ons,
who, after having run through a rapid
cour&s;e of plea&s;ure, after having glittered
for a few years in the foremo&s;t line of
publick amu&s;ements, are the mo&s;t apt to
fly at la&s;t to a melancholy retreat; not
led by religion or rea&s;on, but driven by
di&s;appointed hopes, and exhau&s;ted &s;pirits,
to the pen&s;ive conclu&s;ion, that all is <HI>vanity
and vexation of &s;pirit.</HI></P>
<P>If uninterrupted intercour&s;e with the
world wears out the man of plea&s;ure, it
no le&s;s oppre&s;&s;es the man of bu&s;ine&s;s and
ambition. The &s;tronge&s;t &s;pirits mu&s;t at
length &s;ink under it. The happie&s;t tem|per
<PB N="239" REF="248">
mu&s;t be &s;oured by ince&s;&s;ant returns
of the oppo&s;ition, the incon&s;tancy, and
treachery of men. For he who lives al|ways
in the bu&s;tle of the world, lives in
a perpetual warfare. Here, an enemy
encounters; there, a rival &s;upplants him.
The ingratitude of a friend &s;tings him,
this hour; and the pride of a &s;uperiour
wounds him, the next. In vain he $lies
for relief, to trifling amu&s;ements. The&s;e
may afford a temporary opiate to care;
but they communicate no &s;trength to the
mind. On the contrary, they leave it
more &s;oft and defencele&s;s, when the di&s;|turbances
of life renew their attacks.</P>
<P>Let him who wi&s;hes for an effectual
cure to all the wounds which the world
can inflict, retire from intercour&s;e with
men, to intercour&s;e with God. When
he enters into his clo&s;et, and &s;huts the
door, let him &s;hut out, at the &s;ame time,
all intru&s;ion of worldly care; and dwell
among objects divine and immortal.
Tho&s;e fair pro&s;pects of order and peace,
&s;hall there open to his view, which form
<PB N="240" REF="249">
the mo&s;t perfect contra&s;t to the confu|&s;ion
and mi&s;ery of this earth. The ce|le&s;tial
inhabitants quarrel not; among
them there is neither ingratitude, nor
envy, nor tumult. Men may hara&s;s one
another; but in the kingdom of God,
concord and tranquillity reign for ever.
&mdash;From &s;uch objects, there beams upon
the mind of the pious man, a pure and
enlivening light; there is diffu&s;ed over
his heart, a holy calm. His agitated &s;pi|rit
re-a&s;&s;umes its firmne&s;s, and regains its
peace. The world &s;inks in its import|ance;
and the load of mortality and mi|&s;ery
lo&s;es almo&s;t all its weight. The <HI>green
pastures</HI> open, and the <HI>&s;till waters</HI> flow
around him, be&s;ide which the <HI>Shepherd
of I&s;rael</HI> guides his flock. The di&s;turb|ances
and alarms, &s;o formidable to tho&s;e
who are engaged in the tumults of the
world, &s;eem to him only like thunder
rolling afar off; like the noi&s;e of di&s;tant
waters, who&s;e &s;ound he hears, who&s;e
cour&s;e he traces, but who&s;e waves touch
him not.&mdash;As religious retirement is
<PB N="241" REF="250">
thus evidently conducive to our happi|ne&s;s
in this life, &s;o,</P>
<P>In the &s;econd place, it is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary
in order to prepare us for the life
to come. He who lives always in publick,
cannot live to his own &s;oul. The world
<HI>lieth in wickedne&s;s;</HI> and with good rea&s;on
the Chri&s;tian is exhorted, <HI>not to be con|formed
to it, but transformed by the renew|ing
of his mind.</HI> Our conver&s;ation and
intercour&s;e with the world, is, in &s;everal
re&s;pects, an education for vice. From
our earliest youth, we are accu&s;tomed to
hear riches and honours extolled as the
chief po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of man; and propo&s;ed to
us, as the principal aim of our future pur|&s;uits.
We are trained up to look with ad|miration
on the flattering marks of di|&s;tinction
which they be&s;tow. In the pur|&s;uit
of tho&s;e coveted advantages, we &s;ee
the multitude around us eager and fer|vent.
Principles of duty we may, per|haps,
hear &s;ometimes inculcated; but we
&s;eldom behold them brought into compe|tition
<PB N="242" REF="251">
tition with worldly profit. The &s;oft name,
and plau&s;ibie colours, under which deceit,
&s;en&s;uality, and revenge, are pre&s;ented to
us in common di&s;cour&s;e, weaken, by de|grees,
our natural &s;en&s;e of the di&s;tinction
between good and evil. We often meet
with crimes authorized by high examples,
and rewarded with the care&s;&s;es and &s;miles
of the world. We di&s;cover perhaps, at
la&s;t, that tho&s;e whom we were taught to
reverence, and to regard as our patterns
of conduct, act upon principles no purer
than tho&s;e of others.&mdash;Thus breathing
habitually a contagious air, how certain
is our ruin, uple&s;s we &s;ometimes retreat
from this pe&s;tilential region, and &s;eek for
proper correctives of the di&s;orders which
are contracted there? Religious retirement
both abates the di&s;ea&s;e, and furni&s;hes the
remedy. It le&s;&s;ens the corrupting influ|ence
of the world; and it gives opportu|nity
for better principles to exert their
power. He who is accu&s;tomed to turn
a&s;ide, and commune with him&s;elf, will,
&s;ometimes at lea&s;t, hear of truths which
<PB N="243" REF="252">
the multitude do not tell him. A more
&s;ound in&s;tructor will lift his voice, and
awaken within the heart tho&s;e latent &s;ug|ge&s;tions,
which the world had overpower|ed
and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The acts of prayer and devotion, the
exerci&s;es of faith and repentance, all the
great and peculiar duties of the religion
of Chri&s;t, nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e retirement
from the world. This was one chief end
of their in&s;titution, that they might be
the means of occa&s;ionally &s;eque&s;tering us
from that great &s;cene of vice and the &s;olly,
the continued pre&s;ence of which is &s;o
hurtful. Solitude is the hallowed ground
which religion hath, in every age, cho&s;en
for her own. There, her in&s;piration is
felt, and her &s;acred my&s;teries elevate the
&s;oul. There, falls the tear of contrition;
there, ri&s;es towards heaven the &s;igh of the
heart; there, melts the &s;oul with all the
tenderne&s;s of devotion, and pours it&s;elf
forth, before him who made, and him
who redeemed it. How can any one, who
is unacquainted with &s;uch employments
<PB N="244" REF="253">
of mind, be fit for heaven? If heaven be
the habitation of pure affections, and of
intellectual joy, could &s;uch a &s;tate be re|li&s;hed
by him who is always immer&s;ed
among &s;en&s;ible objects, and has never ac|quired
any ta&s;te for the plea&s;ures of the
under&s;tanding, and the heart?</P>
<P>The great and the worthy, the pious
and the virtuous, have ever been addicted
to &s;erious retirement. It is the charac|tere&s;tick
of little and &s;rivolous minds, to
be wholly occupied with the vulgar ob|jects
of life. The&s;e fill up their de&s;ires,
and &s;upply all the entertainment which
their coar&s;e apprehen&s;ions can reli&s;h. But
a more refined and enlarged mind leaves
the world behind it, feels a call for higher
plea&s;ures, and feeks them in retreat. The
man of publick &s;pirit has recour&s;e to it,
in order to form plans for general good;
the man of genius, in order to dwell on
his favourite themes; the philo&s;opher, to
pur&s;ue his di&s;coveries; the &s;aint, to im|prove
him&s;elf in grace. <HI>I&s;aac went</HI> out to
meditate in the &s;ields, at the evening tide.
<PB N="245" REF="254">
David, amid&s;t all the &s;plendour of royalty,
often bears witne&s;s, both to the plea&s;ure
which he received, and the benefit which
he reaped, from devout meditation. <HI>I
communed with my own heart, and my &s;pirit
made diligent &s;earch. I thought on my ways,
and turned my feet unto God's te&s;timonies. In
the multitude of thoughts within me, his
comforts delight my &s;oul.</HI> Our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour
him&s;elf, though of all who ever li|ved
on earth he needed lea&s;t the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of religious retreat, yet, by his frequent
practice, has done it &s;ignal honour. Often
were the garden, the mountain, and the
&s;ilence of the night, &s;ought by him, for
intercour&s;e with Heaven. <HI>When he had
&s;ent the multitude away, he went up into a
mountain, apart, to pray.</HI></P>
<P>The advantages of religious retire|ment
will &s;till more clearly appear, by
con&s;idering, as was propo&s;ed, in the next
place, &s;ome of tho&s;e great objects which
&s;hould there employ our thoughts. I
&s;hall mention only three, which are of
the mo&s;t plain and acknowledged im|portance;
<PB N="246" REF="255">
God, the world, and our own
character.</P>
<P>I. WHEN you retire from the world,
<HI>commune with your hearts</HI> concerning God.
Impre&s;&s;ions of Deity, be&s;ides their being
the principle of what is &s;trictly termed re|ligion,
are the great &s;upport of all moral
&s;entiment, and virtuous conduct among
men. But with what difficulty are they
pre&s;erved in any due degree of force,
amid&s;t the affairs and avocations of the
world? While the crowd of &s;urrounding
objects is ever ru&s;hting on the imagina|tion,
and occupying the &s;en&s;es and the
heart, what is not only ab&s;ent from view,
but, by its nature, invi&s;ible, is apt to va|ni&s;h
like a &s;hadow. Hence it is given
as the character of wicked men, in &s;crip|ture,
that they are <HI>without God in the
world.</HI> They deny not, perhaps, that he
exi&s;ts; but it is the &s;ame to them as
though he did not: For having lo&s;t him
from their view, his exi&s;tence has no ef|fect
on their conduct. If, at any time,
<PB N="247" REF="256">
the idea of God ri&s;e in their mind, it
ri&s;es like a terrifying phantom which
they ha&s;ten to expell; and which they
gladly fancy to be an unreal appearance,
becau&s;e they &s;ee it make &s;o little impre&s;|&s;ion
on others around them.</P>
<P>Let him who retires to &s;erious medita|tion,
begin with impre&s;&s;ing deeply on his
mind this important truth, that there is
undoubtedly a Supreme Governour, who
pre&s;ides over the univer&s;e. But let him
not imagine, that to commune with his
heart concerning God, is to &s;earch into
the my&s;teries of the Divine Nature, or to
attempt a di&s;covery of the whole plan of
Providence. Long enough he may be|wilder
him&s;elf in this maze, without mak|ing
any proficiency in the practical know|ledge
of God. Shall he who knows &s;o lit|tle
of his own nature, or of the nature of
the objects with which he is &s;urrounded,
expect to comprehend the Being who made
him? To commune with our&s;elves, to any
u&s;eful purpo&s;e, on this &s;ubject, is to bring
home to our &s;ouls the internal, authorita|tive
<PB N="248" REF="257">
&s;en&s;e of God, as of a Sovereign and
a Father. It is not to &s;peculate about
what is doubtful in his e&s;&s;ence, but to
contemplate what is certain in his perfec|tions.
It is to realize the pre&s;ence of the
Supreme Being, &s;o as to produce the mo&s;t
profound veneration; and to awaken the
earne&s;t de&s;ire of as near an approach as
our nature will permit, to that great
Fountain of happine&s;s and life.</P>
<P>After this manner was that holy man
affected, who uttered this ardent wi&s;h<NOTE N="ast;" PLACE="foot">Job xxiii. 3.</NOTE>,
<HI>O that I knew where I might find him, that
1 might come even to his &s;eat!</HI>&mdash;If with
&s;uch a frame of mind you &s;eek after God,
be a&s;&s;ured that he is not far from you;
and that, though you are not permitted
as yet to <HI>come to his &s;eat,</HI> you may, at
lea&s;t, reach the foot&s;tool of his throne, and
touch the robe that covers him. In the
mid&s;t of your &s;olitary mu&s;ings, li&s;t your
eyes, and behold all nature full of God.
Look up to the firmament, and admire
his glory. Look round on the earth, and
ob&s;erve his pre&s;ence every where di&s;played.
<PB N="249" REF="258">
If the gay land&s;cape, or the fruitful field,
pre&s;ent them&s;elves to your eye, behold
him &s;miling upon his works. If the
mountain rai&s;e its lo&s;ty head, or the ex|pan&s;e
of waters roll its tides before you,
contemplate, in tho&s;e great and &s;olemn
objects, his power and maje&s;ty. Nature,
in all its diver&s;ities, is a varied mani|fe&s;tation
of God. If you were to <HI>take the
wings of the morning, and dwell in the ut|termo&s;t
parts of the &s;ea,</HI> even there you
would find him. For <HI>in him you live and
move.</HI> He fills and animates all &s;pace. In
the barren wilderne&s;s, as in the peopled
region, you can trace his foot&s;teps; and
in the deepe&s;t &s;olitude, you may hear a
voice which te&s;tifies of him.</P>
<P>Him, indeed, you are never to confound
with the workman&s;hip of his hands. Na|ture,
in its mo&s;t awful or mo&s;t plea&s;ing
&s;cenes, exhibits no more than different
forms of inanimate matter. But on the&s;e
dead forms is impre&s;&s;ed the glory of a
living Spirit. The beauty, or the great|ne&s;s,
which appears in them, flows from
<PB N="250" REF="259">
the Fountain of all greatne&s;s and beauty;
in him it centers; of his perfection it re|&s;lects
an image; and towards him &s;hould
lead your view.&mdash;In conver&s;ing with a
fellow-creature on earth, it is not with his
body we conver&s;e, though it is his body
only which we &s;ee. From his words and
actions we conceive his mind; with his
mind though invi&s;ible, we hold corre|&s;pondence, and direct towards this &s;piri|tual
E&s;&s;ence, our affection and regard. In
like mannner, though here we behold no
more of God than what his works di&s;|play,
yet, in tho&s;e di&s;plays, we are cap|able
of perceiving the Univer&s;al Spirit, and
of holding corre&s;pondence with this un|&s;een
Being, in veneration, gratitude, and
love.</P>
<P>It is thus that a pious man, in his re|tired
meditations, viewing natural objects
with a &s;piritual eye, communes with his
heart concerning God. He walks among the
various &s;cenes of Nature, as within
the precincts of a great temple, in the
habitual exerci&s;e of devotion. To tho&s;e
<PB N="251" REF="260">
di&s;coveries of the Supreme Being in his
works, let him apply the comment of his
word. From the world of Nature, let him
follow God into the world of Grace. When
conducted from the outer courts, into this
inmo&s;t &s;anctuary of the temple, he &s;hall
feel him&s;elf brought &s;till more nigh to the
Sacred Pre&s;ence. In the great plan of Di|vine
Wi&s;dom, for extirpating the evils pro|duced
by &s;in, he &s;hall receive the interpre|tation
of many of the hidden my&s;teries of
Nature. He &s;hall di&s;cover in Chri&s;t, the
Deity made, in &s;ome degree, vi&s;ible to
&s;en&s;e. In the beneficent works which he
performed, and the gracious undertaking
which he accompli&s;hed, he &s;hall behold
the <HI>brightne&s;s of the Father's glory,</HI> and
&s;hall di&s;cern it to be <HI>full of grace and
truth.</HI>&mdash;From the &s;acred retreat, wherein
his thoughts have been thus employed,
he returns to the world like a &s;uperiour
being. He carries into active life tho&s;e
pure and elevating &s;entiments, to which
the giddy crowd are &s;trangers. A certain
odour of &s;anctity remains upon his mind,
<PB N="252" REF="261">
which, for a while at lea&s;t, will repell the
contagion of the world.</P>
<P>II. COMMUNE with your heart, in the
&s;ea&s;on of retirement, concerning the world.
The world is the great deceiver, who&s;e fal|lacious
arts it highly imports us to detect.
But in the mid&s;t of its plea&s;ures and pur|&s;uits,
the detection is impo&s;&s;ible. We
tread, as within an inchanted circle, where
nothing appears as it truly is. It is only
in retreat, that the charm can be broken.
Did men employ that retreat, not in car|rying
on the delu&s;ion which the world has
begun, not in forming plans of imagi|nary
bli&s;s, but in &s;ubjecting the happi|ne&s;s
which the world affords to a &s;trict
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, the &s;pell would di&s;&s;olve; and
in the room of the unreal pro&s;pects, which
had long amu&s;ed them, the nakedne&s;s of
the world would appear.</P>
<P>Prepare your&s;elves, then, to encounter
the light of truth. Re&s;olve rather to bear
the di&s;appointment of &s;ome flattering
hopes, than to wander for ever in the
<PB N="253" REF="262">
paradi&s;e of fools. While others meditate
in &s;ecret on the means of attaining world|ly
&s;ucce&s;s, let it be your employment to
&s;crutinize that &s;ucce&s;s it&s;elf. Calculate
fairly to what it amounts; and whether
you are not lo&s;ers on the whole, by your
apparent gain. Look back, for this pur|po&s;e,
on your pa&s;t life. Trace it from
your earlie&s;t youth; and put the que&s;tion
to your&s;elves, What have been its happie&s;t
periods? Were they tho&s;e of quiet and
innocence, or tho&s;e of ambition and in|trigue?
Has your real enjoyment uni|formly
kept pace with what the world
calls pro&s;perity? As you advanced in
wealth or &s;tation, did you proportionably
advance in happine&s;s? Has &s;ucce&s;s, almo&s;t
in any one in&s;tance, fulfilled your expect|ations?
Where you reckoned upon mo&s;t
enjoyment, have you not often found
lea&s;t? Wherever guilt entered into your
plea&s;ures, did not its &s;ting long remain,
after the gratification was pa&s;t?&mdash;Such
que&s;tions as the&s;e, candidly an&s;wered,
would in a great mea&s;ure unma&s;k the
<PB N="254" REF="263">
world. They would cxpo&s;e the vanity of
its preten&s;ions; and convince you that
there are other &s;prings than tho&s;e which
the world affords, to which you mu&s;t ap|ply
for happine&s;s.</P>
<P>While you commune with your heart
concerning what the world now is, con|&s;ilder
al&s;o what it will one day appear
to be. Anticipate the awful moment
of your bidding it an eternal farewell.
Think, what reflections &s;hall mo&s;t pro|bably
ari&s;e, when you are quitting the
field, and looking back on the &s;cene of
action. In what light will your clo&s;ing
eyes contemplate tho&s;e vanities which
now &s;hine &s;o bright, and tho&s;e intere&s;ts
which now &s;well into &s;uch high import|ance?
What part will you then wi&s;h to
have acted? What &s;hall then appear mo|mentous,
what tri&s;ling, in human con|duct?
&mdash;Let the &s;ober &s;entiments which
&s;uch anticipations &s;ugge&s;t, temper now
your mi&s;placed ardour. Let the la&s;t con|clu&s;ions
which you &s;hall form, enter into
the pre&s;ent e&s;timate which you make of
the world, and of life.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="264">
Moreover, in communing with your|&s;elves
concerning the world, contemplate
it as &s;ubject to the divine dominion. The
greater part of men behold nothing more
than the rotation of human affairs. They
&s;ee a great crowd ever in motion; the for|tunes
of men alternately ri&s;ing and fall|ing;
virtue often di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and pro&s;peri|ty
appearing to be the purcha&s;e of world|ly
abilities and wi&s;dom. But this is only
the out&s;ide of things. Behind the cur|tain,
there is a far greater &s;cene, which is
beheld only by the retired, religious &s;pec|tator.
Li&s;t up that curtain, when you are
alone with God. View the world with
the eye of a Chri&s;tian; and you &s;hall &s;ee,
that while <HI>man's heart devi&s;eth his way, it
is the Lord who directeth his &s;teps.</HI> You
&s;hall &s;ee, that however men appear to
move and act after their own plea&s;ure,
they are, neverthele&s;s, retained in &s;ecret
bonds by the Almighty, and all their
operations rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to the
ends of his moral government. You &s;hall
&s;ee him obliging <HI>the wrath</HI> of man to
<PB N="256" REF="265">
prai&s;e him; puni&s;hing the &s;inner by means
of his own iniquities; from the trials of
the righteous, bringing forth their reward;
and to a &s;tate of &s;eeming univer&s;al con|fu&s;ion,
preparing the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t equi|table
i&s;&s;ue. While the <HI>fa&s;hion of this world</HI>
is pa&s;&s;ing fa&s;t away, you &s;hall di&s;cern the
glory of another, ri&s;ing to &s;ucceed it. You
&s;hall behold all human events, our griefs
and our joys, our love and our hatred,
our character and memory, ab&s;orbed in
the ocean of eternity; and no trace of our
pre&s;ent exi&s;tence le&s;t, except that it &s;hall
be for ever <HI>well with the righteous, and
ill with the wicked.</HI>&mdash;Such a view of the
world, frequently pre&s;ented to our minds,
could not fail to enforce tho&s;e &s;olemn con|clu&s;ions;
<HI>There is no wi&s;dom, nor coun&s;el,
again&s;t the Lord. Fear God, and keep his
commandments; for this is the whole of man.
What is a man pro&s;ited, if he &s;hall gain the
whole world, and lo&s;e his own, &s;oul?</HI></P>
<P>III. COMMUNE with your heart, con|cerning
your&s;elves and your real charac|ter.
<PB N="257" REF="266">
To acquire a thorough knowledge of
our&s;elves, is an attainment no le&s;s difficult
than important. For men are generally
unwilling to &s;ee their own imperfections;
and when they are willing to enquire in|to
them, their &s;elf-love impo&s;es on their
judgment. Their intercour&s;e with one
another a&s;&s;i&s;ts the delu&s;ion to which, of
them&s;elves, they are prone. For the or|dinary
commerce of the world, is a com|merce
of flattery and fal&s;hood; where re|ciprocally
they deceive, and are deceived;
where every one appears under an a&s;&s;um|ed
form; profe&s;&s;es e&s;teem which he does
not feel; and be&s;tows prai&s;e in order to
receive it. It is only in retreat, where
tho&s;e fal&s;e &s;emblances di&s;appear, and tho&s;e
flattering voices are &s;ilent, that a man
can learn to <HI>think &s;oberly of him&s;elf, and as
he ought to think.</HI></P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that there are three
characters which every man &s;u&s;tains; and
the&s;e often extremely different from one
another: One, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in his
own opinion; another, which he carries
<PB N="258" REF="267">
in the e&s;timation of the world; and a
third, which he bears in the judgment
of God. It is only the la&s;t which a&s;cer|tains
what he really is.&mdash;Whether the
character which the world forms of you,
be above or below the truth, imports you
not much to know. But it is of eternal
con&s;equence, that the character which you
po&s;&s;e&s;s in your own eyes, be formed up|on
that which you bear in the &s;ight of
God. In order to try it by this great
&s;tandard, you mu&s;t lay a&s;ide, as much as
po&s;&s;ible, all partiality to your&s;elves; and,
in the &s;ea&s;on of retirement, explore your
heart with &s;uch accurate &s;crutiny, as may
bring your hidden defects to light.</P>
<P>Enquire, for this purpo&s;e, whether you
be not con&s;cious that the fair opinion
which the world entertains of you, is
founded on their partial knowledge both
of your abilities, and your virtues? Would
you be willing that all your actions &s;hould
be publickly canva&s;&s;ed? Could you bear
to have your thoughts laid open? Are
there no parts of your life which you
<PB N="259" REF="268">
would be unea&s;y if an enemy could di&s;|cover?
In what light, then, mu&s;t the&s;e
appear to God? When you have kept
free of vice, has your innocence pro|ceeded
from purity of principle, or from
worldly motives? Ri&s;es there no envy
or malignity within you, when you com|pare
your own condition with that of
others? Have you been as &s;ollicitous to
regulate your heart, as to pre&s;erve your
manners from reproach? Profe&s;&s;ing your|&s;elves
to be Chri&s;tians, has the Spirit of
Chri&s;t appeared in your conduct? Declar|ring
that you hope for immortality, has
that hope &s;urmounted undue attachments
to the pre&s;ent life?</P>
<P>Such inve&s;tigation as this, &s;eriou&s;ly
pur&s;ued, might produce to every man
many di&s;coveries of him&s;elf; di&s;coveries,
not plea&s;ing, perhaps, to vanity, but &s;a|lutary
and u&s;eful. For he can be only a
flatterer, but no true friend to him&s;elf,
who aims not at knowing his own de|fects,
as well as virtues. By impo&s;ing on
the world, he may carry on &s;ome plan of
<PB N="260" REF="269">
fancied profit; but by impo&s;ing on his
own heart, what can he propo&s;e to gain?
<HI>He feedeth of a&s;hes: A deceived heart
hath turned him a&s;ide, that he cannot deliver
his &s;oul, nor &s;ay, Is there not a lie in my
right hand</HI><NOTE N="ast;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xliv. 20.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>THUS I have &s;et before you &s;ome of
tho&s;e great objects, which ought to em|ploy
your meditation in religious retire|ment.
I have endeavoured to introduce
you into a proper intercour&s;e with your
heart, concerning God, the world, and
your own character. Let this intercour&s;e
terminate in fixing the principles of your
future conduct. Let it &s;erve to introduce
con&s;i&s;tency into your life. Nothing can
be more wavering and disjointed, than the
behaviour of tho&s;e who are wholly men
of the world, and have never been inured
to commune with them&s;elves. Di&s;&s;ipa|tion
is a more frequent cau&s;e of their
ruin, than determined impiety. It is
not &s;o much becau&s;e they have adopted
bad principles, as becau&s;e they have ne|ver
<PB N="261" REF="270">
attended to principles of any kind,
that their lives are &s;o full of incoherence
and di&s;order.&mdash;You hover on the borders
of &s;in and duty. One day, you read the
&s;criptures, you hear religious di&s;cour&s;es,
and form good re&s;olutions. Next day,
you plunge into the world, and forget
the &s;erious impre&s;&s;ion, as if it had been
never made. The impre&s;&s;ion is again re|called,
and again effaced; and in this
circle your life revolves. Is &s;uch conduct
worthy of creatures endowed with intel|ligent
powers? Shall the clo&s;e of life
overtake you, before you have determin|ed
how to live? Shall the day never
come, that is to find you &s;teady in your
views, decided in your plans, and en|gaged
in a cour&s;e of action which your
mind approves?&mdash;If you wi&s;h that day
ever to arrive, retirement and meditation
mu&s;t fir&s;t bring you home to your&s;elves,
from the di&s;&s;ipation in which you are
now &s;cattered; mu&s;t teach you to fix &s;uch
aims, and to lay down &s;uch rules of con|duct,
as are &s;uitable to rational and im|mortal
<PB N="262" REF="271">
beings. Then will your character
become uniform and re&s;pectable. Then,
you may hope that your life will proceed
in &s;uch a train, as &s;hall prepare you,
when it is fini&s;hed, for joining the &s;ociety
of more exalted &s;pirits.</P>

<Q>Cornelius&mdash;A devout man&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT religion is e&s;&s;ential to the
welfare of man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. X.</NOTE> can be proved by
the mo&s;t convincing arguments. But
the&s;e, how demon&s;trative &s;oever, are in|&s;ufficient
to &s;upport its authority over
human conduct. For arguments may
convince the under&s;tanding, when they
cannot conquer the pa&s;&s;ions. Irre&s;i&s;table
they &s;eem in the calm hours of retreat;
but, in the &s;ea&s;on of action, they often
vani&s;h into &s;moke. There are other and
more powerful &s;prings, which influence
<PB N="264" REF="273">
the great movements of the human frame.
In order to operate with &s;ucce&s;s on the
active powers, the heart mu&s;t be gained.
Sentiment and affection mu&s;t be brought
to the aid of rea&s;on. It is not enough
that men believe religion to be a wi&s;e and
rational rule of conduct, unle&s;s they re|li&s;h
it as agreeable, and find it to carry
its own reward. Happy is the man, who,
in the conflict of de&s;ire between God and
the world, can oppo&s;e, not only argument
to argument, but plea&s;ure to plea&s;ure;
who, to the external allurements of &s;en&s;e,
can oppo&s;e the internal joys of devotion;
and to the uncertain promi&s;es of a flatter|ing
world, the certain experience of that
<HI>peace of God which pa&s;&s;eth under&s;tanding,
keeping his mind and heart.</HI>&mdash;Such is the
temper and &s;pirit of a <HI>devout man.</HI> Such
was the character of Cornelius, that good
centurion, who&s;e <HI>prayers and alms are &s;aid</HI>
to have <HI>come up in memorial before God.</HI>
Of this character I intend, through Divine
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to di&s;cour&s;e; and &s;hall endea|vour,
I. To explain the nature of devotion;
<PB N="265" REF="274">
II. To ju&s;tify, and recommend it; and,
III. To rectify &s;ome mi&s;takes concerning
it.</P>
<P>I. DEVOTION is the lively exerci&s;e
of tho&s;e affections, which we owe to the
Supreme Being. It comprehends &s;everal
emotions of the heart, which all termi|nate
on the &s;ame great object. The chief
of them are, veneration, gratitude, de&s;ire,
and re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>It implies, fir&s;t, profound veneration of
God. By veneration, I under&s;tand a di&s;|po&s;ition,
compounded of awe, and of love;
the di&s;po&s;ition which, of all others, it be&s;t
becomes creatures to bear towards their
infinitely perfect Creator. Awe is the
fir&s;t &s;entiment which ri&s;es in the &s;oul, at
the view of his greatne&s;s. But, in the
heart of a devout man, it is a &s;olemn
and elevating, not a dejecting, emotion;
for he glows, rather than trembles, in the
Divine pre&s;ence. It is not the &s;uper&s;ti|tious
dread of unknown power, but the
homage yielded by the heart to him who
<PB N="266" REF="275">
is, at once, the greate&s;t and the be&s;t of Be|ings.
Omnipotence, viewed alone, would
be a formidable object. But, con&s;idered
in conjunction with the moral perfections
of the Divine Nature, it &s;erves to heighten
devotion. Goodne&s;s affects the heart with
double energy, when re&s;idiing in one &s;o
exalted. The goodne&s;s which we adore
in him, is not like that which is common
among men, a weak, mutable, undi&s;|cerning
fondne&s;s, ill qualified to be the
ground of a&s;&s;ured tru&s;t. It is the good|ne&s;s
of a perfect Governour, acting upon a
regular, exten&s;ive plan; a &s;teady principle
of benevolence, conducted by wi&s;dom;
which, &s;ubject to no <HI>variablene&s;s or &s;ha|dow
of turning,</HI> free from all partiality and
caprice, incapable of being either &s;oothed
by flattery, or ruffled by re&s;entment, re|&s;embles,
in its calm and equal lu&s;tre, the
eternal &s;erenity of the highe&s;t heavens.</P>
<P>Thy mercy, O Lord! is in the heavens; and
thy faithfulne&s;s reacheth unto the clouds. Thy
righteou&s;ne&s;s is like the great mountains, and
thy judgments are a great depth.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="276">
Such are the conceptions of the great
God, which fill with veneration the heart
of a devout man. His veneration is not
confined to acts of immediate wor&s;hip.
It is the habitual temper of his &s;oul. Not
only when engaged in prayer of prai&s;e,
but in the &s;ilence of retirement, and even
amid&s;t the occupations of the world, the
Divine Being dwells upon his thoughts.
No place, and no object, appear to him
void of God. On the works of Nature,
he views the impre&s;&s;ion of his hand; and
in the actions of men, he traces the ope|ration
of his Providence. Whatever he
beholds on earth, that is beautiful or fair,
that is great or good, he refers to God,
as to the &s;upreme origin of all the ex|cellence
which is any where &s;cattered
through his works. From tho&s;e effects,
he ri&s;es to the fir&s;t cau&s;e. From tho&s;e
&s;treams, he a&s;cends to the fountain whence
they flow. By tho&s;e rays, he is led to that eternal &s;ource of light in which they
centre.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="277">
DEVOTION implies, &s;econdly, &s;incere
gratitude to God, for all his benefits.
This is a warmer emotion than &s;imple
veneration. Veneration looks up to the
Deity, as he is in him&s;elf: Gratitude re|gards
what he is towards us. When a de|vout
man &s;urveys this va&s;t univer&s;e, where
beauty and goodne&s;s are every-where pre|dominant;
when he reflects on tho&s;e num|berle&s;s
multitudes of creatures, who, in
their different &s;tations, enjoy the ble&s;|&s;ings
of exi&s;tence; and when at the &s;ame
time he looks up to an Univer&s;al Father,
who hath thus filled creation with life
and happine&s;s, his heart glows within
him. He adores that di&s;intere&s;ted good|ne&s;s,
which prompted the Almighty to
rai&s;e up &s;o many orders of intelligent
beings, not that he might receive, but
that he might give and impart; that he
might pour forth him&s;elf, and communi|cate
to the &s;pirits which he formed, &s;ome
emanations of his felicity.</P>
<P>The goodne&s;s of this Supreme Benefactor
he gratefully contemplates, as di&s;played in
<PB N="269" REF="278">
his own &s;tate. He reviews the events of
his life; and, in every comfort which has
&s;weetened it, he di&s;cerns the Divine hand.
Does he remember with affection the pa|rents
under who&s;e care he grew up, and
the companions with whom he po&s;&s;ed his
youthful life? Is he now happy, in his
family ri&s;ing around him; in the &s;pou&s;e
who loves him, or in the children who
give him comfort and joy? Into every ten|der
remembrance of the pa&s;t, and every
plea&s;ing enjoyment of the pre&s;ent, devo|tion
enters; for in all tho&s;e beloved ob|jects,
it recognizes God. The communi|cation
of love from heart to heart, is an
effu&s;ion of his goodne&s;s. From his in&s;pi|ration,
de&s;cends all the friend&s;hip which
ever glowed on earth; and therefore, to
him it ju&s;tly returns in gratitude, and ter|minates
on him.</P>
<P>But this life, with all its intere&s;ts, is
but a &s;mall part of human exi&s;tence. A
devout man looks forward to immortali|ty,
and di&s;covers higher &s;ubjects of grati|tude
to Heaven. He views him&s;elf as a
<PB N="270" REF="279">
guilty creature, whom Divine benignity
has received into grace; who&s;e forfeited
hopes it has re&s;tored; and to whom it
has opened the mo&s;t glorious pro&s;pects of
future felicity. Such genero&s;ity &s;hown
to the fallen and mi&s;erable, is &s;till more
a&s;&s;ecting to the heart, than favours con|ferred
on the innocent. He contemplates,
with a&s;toni&s;hment, the labours of the Son
of God, in accompli&s;hing redemption for
men; and his &s;oul overflows with thank|fulne&s;s
to him <HI>who loved us, and wa&s;hed
us from our &s;ins in his own blood.&mdash;what &s;hall
1 render to the Lord for all his benefits? Ble&s;s
the Lord, O my &s;oul! and all that is within
me, ble&s;s his holy name! who forgiveth
all thine iniquities, and healeth all thy di&s;|ca&s;es;
who redeemeth thy life from de&s;truc|tion,
and crowneth thee with loving kind|ne&s;s,
and with tender mercies.</HI></P>
<P>DEVOTION implies, thirdly, the defire
of the &s;oul after the favour of the Supreme
Being, as its chief good, and final re&s;t.
To inferiour enjoyments, the devout man
<PB N="271" REF="280">
allots inferiour and &s;econdary attach|ment.
He di&s;claims not every earthly af|fection.
He pretends not to renounce all
plea&s;ure in the friends, and the comforts,
of his pre&s;ent &s;tate. Such an unnatural
renunciation humanity forbids, and reli|gion
cannot require. But from the&s;e he
expects not his &s;upreme bli&s;s. He di&s;eerns
the vanity which belongs to them all;
and beyond the circle of mutable objects
which &s;urround him, he a&s;pires after &s;ome
principle of more perfect felicity, which
&s;hall not be &s;ubject to change or decay.
But where is this complete and perma|nent
good to be found? Ambition pur|&s;ues
it in courts and palaces; and returns
from the pur&s;uit, loaded with &s;orrows.
Plea&s;ure &s;eeks it among &s;en&s;ual joys; and
retires with the confe&s;&s;ion of di&s;appoint|ment.
<HI>The deep faith, it is not in me; and the
&s;ea faith, it ts not with me. It cannot be gotten
for gold; neither &s;hall &s;ilver be weighed for
the price thereof. Its place is not in the land
of the living. True happine&s;s dwells with
God; and from the light of his countenance,</HI>
<PB N="272" REF="281">
it beams upon the devout man. His voice
is, <HI>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and
there is none upon earth that I de&s;ire be&s;ide
thee.</HI> After exploring heaven and earth
for happine&s;s, they &s;eem to him a mighty
void, a wilderne&s;s of &s;hadows, where all
would be empty and un&s;ub&s;tantial with|out
God. But in his favour and love, he
finds what &s;upplies every defect of tem|poral
objects; and a&s;&s;ures tranquillity to
his heart, amid&s;t all the changes of his
exi&s;tence. <HI>Thou &s;halt guide me with thy
coun&s;el; and thou &s;halt receive me to thy
glory. My fle&s;h and my heart faileth; but
God is the &s;trength of my heart, and my por|tion
for ever.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the&s;e &s;entiments and affections,
Devotion advances, fourthly, to an en|tire
re&s;ignation of the &s;oul to God. It is
the con&s;ummation of tru&s;t and hope. It
bani&s;hes anxious cares, and murmuring
thoughts. It reconciles us to every ap|pointment
of Divine Providence; and re|&s;olves
every wi&s;h into the de&s;ire of plea&s;|ing
<PB N="273" REF="282">
him, whom our hearts adore. Its
genuine breathings are to this effect:
&startq;Conduct me, O God! in what path
&s;oever &s;eemeth good to thee. In no|thing
&s;hall I ever arraign thy &s;acred
will. Do&s;t thou require me to part
with any worldly advantages, for the
&s;ake of virtue and a good con&s;cience?
I give them up. Do&s;t thou command
me to relinqui&s;h my friends, or my
country? At thy call I chearfully
leave them. Do&s;t thou &s;ummon me
away from this world? Lo! I am
ready to depart. Thou ha&s;t made,
thou ha&s;t redeemed me, and I am
thine. My&s;elf, and all that belongs to
me, I &s;urrender to thy di&s;po&s;al. Let
the men of the world have <HI>their portion
in this life, and be filled with its hidden
trea&s;ures.</HI> Be it mine, to <HI>behold thy face
in righteou&s;ne&s;s; and when I awake, to
be &s;atisfied with thy likene&s;s.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>This, &s;urely, is one of the noble&s;t acts
of which the human mind is capable,
when thus, if we may be allowed the ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="274" REF="283">
it unites it&s;elf with God. Nor
can any devotion be genuine, which in|&s;pires
not &s;entiments of this nature. For
devotion is not to be con&s;idered as a
tran&s;ient glow of affection, occa&s;ioned by
&s;ome ca&s;ual impre&s;&s;ions of Divine good|ne&s;s,
which are &s;uffered to remain un|connected
with the conduct of life. It is
a powerful principle, which penetrates
the inmo&s;t &s;oul; which purifies the af|fections
from deba&s;ing attachments; and,
by a fixed and &s;teady regard to God, &s;ub|dues
every &s;inful pa&s;&s;ion, and forms the
inclinations to piety and virtue.</P>
<P>SUCH in general are the di&s;po&s;itions
that con&s;titute devotion. It is the union
of veneration, gratitude, de&s;ire, and re|&s;ignation.
It expre&s;&s;es, not &s;o much the
performance of any particular duty, as
the &s;pirit which mu&s;t animate all religious
duties. It &s;tands oppo&s;ed, not merely to
downright vice; but to a heart which is
cold, and in&s;en&s;ible to &s;acred things;
which, from compul&s;ion perhaps, and a
<PB N="275" REF="284">
&s;en&s;e of intere&s;t, pre&s;erves &s;ome regard to
the Divine commands, but obeys them
without ardour, love, or joy. I proceed,</P>
<P>II. To recommend this devout &s;pirit
to your imitation. I begin with ob&s;erv|ing,
that it is of the unmo&s;t con&s;equence
to guard again&s;t extremes of every kind
in religion. We mu&s;t beware, le&s;t, by
&s;eeking to avoid one rock, we &s;plit upon
another. It has been long the &s;ubject of
remark, that &s;uper&s;ttition and enthu&s;ia&s;m
are two capital &s;ources of delu&s;ion; &s;u|per&s;tition,
on the one hand, attaching
men with immoderate zeal, to the ritual
and external part of religion; and enthu|&s;ia&s;m,
on the other, directing their whole
attention to internal emotions, and my|&s;tical
communications with the &s;piritual
world; while neither the one, nor the
other, has paid &s;ufficient regard to the
great moral duties of the Chri&s;tian life.
But, running with intemperate eagerne&s;s,
from the&s;e two great abu&s;es of religion,
men have neglected to ob&s;erve, that there
<PB N="276" REF="285">
are extremes oppo&s;ite to each of them,
into which they are in hazard of precipi|tating
them&s;elves. Thus the horrour of &s;u|per&s;tition
has &s;ometimes reached &s;o far, as
to produce contempt for all external in&s;ti|tutions;
as if it were po&s;&s;ible for religion
to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the world, without forms of
wor&s;hip, or publick acknowledgment of
God. It has al&s;o happened, that &s;ome
who in the main are well affected to the
cau&s;e of goodne&s;s, ob&s;erving that per&s;ons
of a devout turn, have at times been car|ried
by warm affections into unju&s;tifiable
exce&s;&s;es, have thence ha&s;tily concluded,
that all devotion was akin to enthu&s;i|a&s;m;
and, &s;eparating religion totally from
the heart and affections, have reduced it
to a frigid ob&s;ervance of what they call
the rules of virtue. This is the extreme
which I purpo&s;e at pre&s;ent to combat, by
&s;howing you, fir&s;t, That true devotion is
rational, and well founded; next, That it
is of the highe&s;t importance to every other
part of religion and virtue; and, la&s;tly,
That it is mo&s;t conducive to our happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="286">
IN the fir&s;t place, True devotion is ra|tional,
and well founded. It takes its ri&s;e
from affections, which are e&s;&s;ential to the
human frame. We are formed by Nature,
to admire what is great, and to love what
is amiable. Even inanimate objects have
power to excite tho&s;e emotions. The mag|nificent
pro&s;pects of the natural world, fill
the mind with reverential awe. Its beau|tiful
&s;cenes create delight. When we &s;ur|vey
the actions and behaviour of our fel|low-creatures,
the affections glow with
greater ardour; and, if to be unmoved,
in the former ca&s;e, argues a defect of &s;en|&s;ibility
in our powers, it di&s;covers, in the
latter, an odious hardne&s;s and depravity
in the heart. The tenderne&s;s of an affec|tionate
parent, the genero&s;ity of a for|giving
enemy, the publick &s;pirit of a pa|triot
or a hero, often fill the eyes with
tears, and &s;well the brea&s;t with emotions
too big for utterance. The object of tho&s;e
affections is frequently rai&s;ed above us, in
condition and rank. Let us &s;uppo&s;e him
rai&s;ed al&s;o above us, in nature. Let us
<PB N="278" REF="287">
imagine, that an angel, or any being of
&s;uperiour order, had conde&s;cended to be
our friend, our guide, and patron; no
per&s;on, &s;ure, would hold the exaltation of
his benefactor's character, to be an argu|ment
why he &s;hould love and revere him
le&s;&s;.&mdash;Strange! that the attachment and
veneration, the warmth and overflowing
of heart, which excellence and goodne&s;s
on every other occa&s;ion command, &s;hould
begin to be accounted irrational, as &s;oon as
the Supreme Being becomes their object.
For what rea&s;on mu&s;t human &s;en&s;ibility
be extinct towards him alone? Are all
benefits entitled to gratitude, except the
highe&s;t and the be&s;t? Shall goodne&s;s
cea&s;e to be amiable, only becau&s;e it is
perfect?</P>
<P>It will, perhaps, be &s;aid, that an un|known
and invi&s;ible Being, is not quali|fied
to rai&s;e affection in the human heart.
Wrapt up in the my&s;terious ob&s;curity of
his nature, he e&s;capes our &s;earch, and af|fords
no determinate object to our love
or de&s;ire. We go forward, but he is not
<PB N="279" REF="288">
there; and backward, but we cannot per|ceive
him; on the le&s;t hand, where he
worketh, but we cannot behold him: He
hideth him&s;elf on the right hand, that we
cannot &s;ee him<NOTE N="ast;" PLACE="foot">Job xxxiii. 8, 9.</NOTE>. Notwith&s;tanding this
ob&s;curity, is there any being in the uni|ver&s;e
more real and certain, than the Cre|ator
of the world, and the Supporter of
all exi&s;tence? Is he, <HI>in whom we live and
move,</HI> too di&s;tant from us, to excite de|votion?
His form and e&s;&s;ence, indeed,
we cannot &s;ee; but to be un&s;een, and
imperfectly known, in many other in|&s;tances,
precludes neither gratitude nor
love. It is not the &s;ight, &s;o much as the
&s;trong conception, or deep impre&s;&s;ion, of
an object, which affects the pa&s;&s;ions. We
glow with admiration of per&s;onages, who
have lived in a di&s;tant age. Whole na|tions
have been tran&s;ported with zeal and
affection, for the generous hero, or pu|blick
deliverer, whom they knew only by
&s;ame. Nay, properly &s;peaking, the direct
object of our love, is, in every ca&s;e, invi|&s;ible.
For that on which affecion is
<PB N="280" REF="289">
placed, is the mind, the &s;oul, the internal
character of our fellow-creatures; which,
&s;urely, is no le&s;s concealed, than the Di|vine
Nature it&s;elf is, from the view of
&s;en&s;e. From actions, we can only infer
the di&s;po&s;itions of men; from what we &s;ee
of their behaviour, We collect what is in|vi&s;ible;
but the conjecture which we form,
is, at beft, imperfect; and when their ac|tions
excite our love, much of their heart
remains &s;till unknown. I a&s;k then, in
what re&s;pect God is le&s;s qualified than
any other being, to be an object of affec|tion?
Convinced that he exi&s;ts; beholding
his goodne&s;s &s;pread abroad in his works,
exerted in the government of the world,
di&s;played in &s;ome mea&s;ure to &s;en&s;e, in the
actions of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t; are we
not furni&s;hed with every e&s;&s;ential requi|&s;ite
which the heart demands, in order
to indulge the mo&s;t warm, and at the
&s;ame time the mo&s;t rational emotions?</P>
<P>If the&s;e con&s;iderations ju&s;tify the rea|&s;onablene&s;s
of devotion, as expre&s;&s;ed in
veneration, love, and gratitude, the &s;ame
<PB N="281" REF="290">
train of thought will equally ju&s;tify it,
when appearing in the forms of de&s;ire,
delight, or re&s;ignation. The latter are, in|deed,
the con&s;equence of the former. For
we cannot but de&s;ire &s;ome communica|tion
with what we love; and will natu|rally
re&s;ign our&s;elves to one, on whom we
have placed the full confidence of affec|tion.
The a&s;pirations of a devout man
after the favour of God, are the effects of
that earne&s;t wi&s;h for happine&s;s, which
glows in every brea&s;t. All men have &s;ome|what
that may be called the object of their
devotion; reputation, plea&s;ure, learning,
riches, or whatever apparent good has
&s;trongly attached their heart. This be|comes
the center of attraction, which ha|bitually
draws them towards it; which
quickens and regulates all their motions.
While the men of the world are thus
cla&s;&s;ed, and employed, according to the
objects which they &s;everally wor&s;hip, &s;hall
he only who directs his devotion towards
the Supreme Being, be excluded from a
place in the &s;y&s;tem of rational conduct?
<PB N="282" REF="291">
or be allowed no pa&s;&s;ions, which, in the
cour&s;e of their pur&s;uit, may melt with
tenderne&s;s, or ri&s;e into fervour?&mdash;Having
vindicated the rea&s;onablene&s;s of devotion,
I come,</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, to &s;how its im|portance,
and the high place which it
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in the &s;y&s;tem of religion. I ad|dre&s;s
my&s;elf now to tho&s;e, who, though
they reject not devotion as irrational, yet
con&s;ider it as an unnece&s;&s;ary refinement; an
attainment which may be &s;afely left to re|clu&s;e
and &s;eque&s;tered per&s;ons, who aim at
uncommon &s;anctity. The &s;olid and ma|terial
duties of a good life, they hold to
be in a great mea&s;ure independent of de|vout
affection; and think them &s;ufficient|ly
&s;upported, by their nece&s;&s;ary connec|tion
with our intere&s;t, both in this and in
a future world. They en&s;i&s;t much upon
religion being a calm, a &s;ober, and ratio|nal
principle of conduct.&mdash;I admit that
it is very laudable to have a rational re|ligion.
But 1 mu&s;t admoni&s;h you, that it
<PB N="283" REF="292">
is both reproachful and criminal, to have
an in&s;en&s;ible heart. If we reduce religion
into &s;o cool a &s;tate, as not to admit love,
affection, and de&s;ire, we &s;hall leave it in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;mall influence over human
life. Look abroad into the world, and
ob&s;erve how few act upon deliberate and
rational views of their true intere&s;t. The
bulk of mankind are impelled by their,
feelings. They are attracted by appear|ances
of good. Ta&s;te and inclination rule
their conduct. To direct their inclination
and ta&s;te towards the highe&s;t objects; to
form a reli&s;h within them, for virtuous and
&s;piritual enjoyment; to introduce religion
into the heart, is the province of devotion;
and hence ari&s;es its importance to the in|tere&s;ts
of goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Agreeably to this doctrine, the great
Author of our religion, who well <HI>knew
what was in man,</HI> laid the foundation of
his whole &s;y&s;tem in the regeneration of
the heart. The change which was to be
accompli&s;hed on his followers, he did not
purpo&s;e to effect, merely by regulating
<PB N="284" REF="293">
their external conduct; but by forming
within them a new nature; by <HI>taking
away the heart of &s;tone, and giving them
a heart of fte&s;h,</HI> that is, a heart relenting
and tender, yielding to the Divine im|pul&s;e,
and readily &s;u&s;ceptible of devout
impre&s;&s;ions. <HI>Thou &s;halt love the Lord thy
God, with all thy heart, and mind, and &s;oul,
and &s;trength: This is the fir&s;t and great
commandment. My &s;on, give me thy heart,</HI>
is the call of God to each of us; And, in|deed,
if the heart be withheld, it is not
ea&s;y to conceive, what other offering we
can pre&s;ent, that will be acceptable to
him.</P>
<P>Of what nature mu&s;t that man's reli|gion
be, who profe&s;&s;es to wor&s;hip God,
and to believe in Chri&s;t, and yet rai&s;es
his thoughts towards God, and his Savi|our,
without any warmth of gratitude or
love? I &s;peak not of tho&s;e occa&s;ional de|cays
of pious affection, to which the be&s;t
are &s;ubject, but of a total in&s;en&s;ibility to
this part of religion. Surely, let the out|ward
behaviour be ever &s;o irreproachable,
<PB N="285" REF="294">
there mu&s;t be &s;ome e&s;&s;ential defect in a
heart, which remains always unmoved at
the view of infinite goodne&s;s. The affec|tions
cannot, in this ca&s;e, be deemed to
flow in their natural channel. Some con|cealed
malignity mu&s;t have tainted the in|ward
frame. This is not the man whom
you would chu&s;e for your bo&s;om-friend;
or who&s;e heart you could expect to an|&s;wer,
with reciprocal warmth, to yours.
His virtue, if it de&s;erve that name, is
not of the mo&s;t amiable fort; and may,
with rea&s;on, receive the appellation (often
injudiciou&s;ly be&s;towed) of cold and dry
morality. Such a per&s;on mu&s;t, as yet, be
<HI>far from the kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>As devotion is thus e&s;&s;ential to religion
in its principle, &s;o it enters into the pro|per
di&s;charge of all its duties. It diffu&s;es
an au&s;picious influence over the whole of
virtue. The prevailing temper of the mind
is formed by its mo&s;t frequent employ|ments.
Intercour&s;e with Supreme per|fection
cannot, therefore, but ennoble and
improve it. The pure love of God, natu|rally
<PB N="286" REF="295">
rally connects it&s;elf with the love of man.
Hence, devotion has been often found a
powerful in&s;trument, in humanizing the
manners of men, and taming their unruly
pa&s;&s;ions. It &s;mooths what is rough, and
&s;oftens what is &s;ierce, in our nature. It is
the great purifier of the affections. It in|&s;ipires
contempt of the low gratifications
belonging to animal life. It promotes a
humble and chearful contentment with
our lot; and &s;ubdues that eager de&s;ire of
riches and of power, which has filled this
unhappy world with crimes and mi&s;ery.
Finally, it be&s;tows that enlargement of
heart in the &s;ervice of God, which is the
great principle, both of per&s;everance, and
of progre&s;s, in virtue. He who, unac|quainted
with devout affections, &s;ets him|&s;elf
to keep the Divine commandments,
will advance in obedience with a &s;low
and languid pace; like one who, carrying
a heavy burden, toils to mount the hill.
But he who&s;e heart devotion has warmed,
will proceed on his way, chearful and re|joicing.
The one performs his duty, only
<PB N="287" REF="296">
becau&s;e it is commanded; the other, be|cau&s;e
he loves it. The one is inclined to
do no more, than nece&s;&s;ity requires; the
other &s;eeks to excell. The one looks for
his reward in &s;omewhat be&s;ides religion;
the other finds it in religion it&s;elf: It is
<HI>his meat and drink to do the will of that
heavenly Father,</HI> whom he loves and adores.
Which of the&s;e two are likely to make the
greate&s;t. improvement in goodne&s;s, is ea&s;i|ly
di&s;cerned. Let us now con&s;ider,</P>
<P>IN the third place, the influence of
devotion on the happine&s;s of life. What|ever
promotes and &s;trengthens virtue,
whatever calms and regulates the tem|per,
is a &s;ource of happine&s;s. Devotion,
as I have ju&s;t now &s;hown, produces tho&s;e
effects in a remarkable degree. It in|&s;pires
compo&s;ure of &s;pirit, mildne&s;s, and
benignity; weakens the painful, and che|ri&s;hes
the plea&s;ing emotions; and, by the&s;e
means, carries on the life of a pious man
in a &s;mooth and placid tenor.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="297">
Be&s;ides exerting this habitual influence
on the mind, devotion opens a field of
enjoyments, to which the vitious are entire
&s;trangers; enjoyments the more valuable,
as they peculiarly belong to retirement
when the world leaves us, and to adver|&s;ity
when it becomes our foc. The&s;e are
the two &s;ea&s;ons, for which every wi&s;e man
would mo&s;t wi&s;h to provide &s;ome hidden
&s;tore of comfort. For let him be placed
in the mo&s;t favourable &s;ituation which
the human &s;tate admits, the world can
neither always amu&s;e him, nor always
&s;hield him from di&s;tre&s;s. There Will be
many hours of vacuity, and many of de|jection,
in his life. If he be a &s;tranger to
God, and to devotion, how dreary will
the gloom of &s;olitude often prove? with
what oppre&s;&s;ive weight will &s;ickne&s;s, di&s;|appointment,
or old age, fall upon his
&s;pirits? But, for tho&s;e pen&s;ive periods,
the pious man has a relief prepared. From
the tire&s;ome repetition of the common va|nities
of life, or from the painful corro&s;ion
of its cares and &s;orrows, devotion trans|ports
<PB N="289" REF="298">
him into a new region; and &s;ur|rounds
him there with &s;uch objects as are
the mo&s;t fitted to chear the dejection, to
calm the tumults, and to heal the wounds
of hia heart. If the world has been empty
and delu&s;ive, it gladdens him with the
pro&s;pect of a higher and better order of
thing?, about to ari&s;e. If men have been
ungrateful and ba&s;e, it di&s;plays before him
the faithfulne&s;s of that Supreme Being,
who, though every other friend fail, will
never forsake him.&mdash;Con&s;ult your experi|ence,
and you will find that the two great|e&s;t
&s;ources of inward joy, are, the exer|ci&s;e
of love directed towards a de&s;erving
object, and the exerci&s;e of hope termi|nating
on &s;ome high and a&s;&s;ured happi|ne&s;s.
Both the&s;e are &s;upplied by devo|tion;
and therefore we have no rea&s;on to
be &s;urpri&s;ed, if, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, it fill
the hearts of good men with a &s;atisfaction
not to be expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>The refined pleasures of a pious mind,
are, in many re&s;pects, &s;uperiour to the
<PB N="290" REF="299">
coar&s;e gratifications of &s;en&s;e. They are
plea&s;ures which belong to the highe&s;t
powers, and be&s;t affections of the &s;oul;
whereas, the gratifications of &s;ence re&s;ide
in the lowe&s;t region of our nature. To
the one, the &s;oul &s;toops below its native
dignity. The other, rai&s;e it above it|&s;elf.
The one, leave always a-comfortle&s;s,
often a mortifying remembrance behind
them. The other, are reviewed with ap|plau&s;e
and delight. The plea&s;ures of
&s;en&s;e re&s;emble a foaming torrent, which,
after a di&s;ordcrly cour&s;e, &s;peedily runs
out, and leaves an empty and offen&s;ive
channel. But the plca&s;ures of devotion
re&s;emble the equable current of a pure
river, which enlivens the fields through
which it pa&s;&s;es, and diffu&s;es verdure and
fertility along its banks.&mdash;To thee, O
Devotion! we owe the highe&s;t improve|ment
of our nature, and much of the en|joyment
of our life. Thou art the &s;up|port
of our virtue, and the re&s;t of our
&s;ouls in this turbulent world. Thou com|po&s;e&s;t
the thoughts. Thou calme&s;t the
<PB N="291" REF="300">
pa&s;&s;ions. Thou exalte&s;t the heart. Thy
communications, and thine only, are im|parted
to the low, no le&s;s than to the
high; to the poor, as well as to the rich.
In thy pre&s;ence, worldly di&s;tinctions eca&s;e;
and under thy influence, worldly &s;orrows
are forgotten. Thou art the balm of the
wounded mind. Thy &s;anctuary is ever
open to the mi&s;erable; inacce&s;&s;ible only
to the unrighteous and impure. Thou
beginne&s;t on earth the temper of heaven.
In thee, the ho&s;ts of angels and ble&s;&s;ed
&s;pirits eternally rejoice.&mdash;It now remains,
that,</P>
<P>III. I ENDEAVOUR to correct &s;ome er|rors,
into which men are apt to fall con|cerning
devotion. For it is but too ob|vious,
that errors are often committed in
this part of religion. The&s;e frequently
disfigure its appearance before the world,
and &s;ubject it to unju&s;t reproach. Let us
therefore attend deliberately to its nature,
&s;o as to di&s;tingui&s;h. pure and rational de|votion,
of which I have hitherto treated,
<PB N="292" REF="301">
from that which is, in any degree, &s;puri|ous
and adulterated.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t, place. It is an error to place
devotion in the mere performance of any
external act of wor&s;hip. Prayer and
prai&s;e, together with the ordinances pe|culiar
to Chri&s;tian religion, are the ap|pointed
means of rai&s;ing the heart towards
God. They are the instituted &s;igns of de|votion;
the language in which it natu|rally
expre&s;&s;es it&s;elf. But let us remem|ber,
that they are &s;igns and expre&s;&s;ions
only; and we all know, that, in various
ca&s;es, the&s;e may not corre&s;pond to the
thing &s;ignified. It is in the di&s;po&s;ition of
the heart, not in the motion of the lips,
or in the posture of the body, that devo|tion
con&s;i&s;ts. The heart may pray or
prai&s;e, when no words are uttered. But
if the heart be unconcerned or ill affected,
all the words we can utter, how properly
framed &s;oever, are no other than empty
and unacceptable &s;ounds in the ear of the
Almighty.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="302">
IN the &s;econd place, It is an error to
conceive the plea&s;ures and advantages of
devotion, to be indi&s;criminately open to
all. Devotion, like many parts of reli|gion,
may in &s;ome lights be con&s;idered as
a privilege, and in others, as a duty. It is
the duty of all, to love God, and to re&s;ign
them&s;elves to his will. But it is the privi|lege
of good men only, to rejoice in God,
and to confide in his friend&s;hip. Hence,
a certain preparation is requi&s;ite, for the
enjoyment of devotion in its whole extent.
Not only mu&s;t the life be reformed from
gro&s;s enormities, but the heart mu&s;t have
undergone that change which the Go&s;pel
points out. A competent knowledge of
God mu&s;t be acquired. A proper found|ation
mu&s;t be laid in faith and repent|ance,
for intercour&s;e with Heaven.</P>
<P>They who would ru&s;h all at once from
the arms of the world, into the &s;acred
retreat of devotion; they who imagine
that retreat to &s;tand always ready for the
reception of &s;uch as betake them&s;elves to
it, for no rea&s;on, but becau&s;e every other
<PB N="294" REF="303">
refuge excludes them, betray gro&s;s igno|rance
of this part of religion. They bring
to it, faculties unqualified to ta&s;te its plea|&s;ures;
and they gra&s;p at hopes to which
they are not entitled. By incorporating
with devotion the unnatural mixture of
their un&s;anctified pa&s;&s;ions, they defile and
corrupt it. Hence, that gloom which has
often &s;pread over it. Hence, tho&s;e &s;uper|&s;titious
mortifications and au&s;terities, by
which the fal&s;ely devout hope to purcha&s;e
favour from God; haunted by the terrours
of a guilty con&s;cience, and vainly &s;trug|gling
to &s;ub&s;titute a &s;ervile and cringing
homage, in the room of the pure affec|tions
of a renewed heart. On &s;uch altars,
the hallowed fire of true devotion cannot
burn; nor can any incen&s;e a&s;cend from
them, that &s;hall be grateful to Heaven.
<HI>Bring no more vain oblations. Wa&s;h ye, make
you clean, put away the evil of your doings
from before mine eyes, faith the Lord. Cea&s;e to
do evil; learn to do well.</HI> Then <HI>draw nigh
to God, and he will draw nigh to you.</HI>&mdash;
But though devotion requires a pure
<PB N="295" REF="304">
heart, and a virtuous life, and nece&s;&s;arily
&s;uppo&s;es the exerci&s;e of frequent retire|ment,
I mu&s;t ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>IN the third place, That it is an error
to conceive it as requiring an entire re|treat
from the world. Devotion, like eve|ry
other branch of religion, was intended
to fit us for di&s;charging the duties of
life. We &s;erve God, by being u&s;eful to
one another. It is evident from the frame
of our nature, and from our common ne|ce&s;&s;ities
and wants, that we were de&s;igned
by Providence for an active part on this
earth. The Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, accordingly,
con&s;iders us as engaged in the concerns
of the world; and directs its exhortations
to men in all the various relations, cha|racters,
and employments of civil life.
Ab&s;traction from &s;ociety, therefore, and
total dedication of our time to devout ex|erci&s;es,
cannot be the mo&s;t proper method
of acquiring the favour of God.</P>
<P>I mean not, however, to throw any
blame on tho&s;e, who having lo&s;t all re|li&s;h
<PB N="296" REF="305">
for the ordinary pur&s;uits of life, in
con&s;equence of great and &s;evere wounds
which they have &s;uffered from affliction;
who, feeling them&s;elves &s;tanding alone,
and di&s;cerning their connections with
the world to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure broken
off, choo&s;e to &s;eek tranquillity in a religi|ous
retirement, and to con&s;ecrate their
days entirely to God. Situations &s;ome|times
occur, which both ju&s;tify a great
degree of retreat from the world, and en|title
it to re&s;pect. But, with regard to the
bulk of mankind, Chri&s;tian devotion in|fers
not, requires not, any &s;uch &s;eque&s;tra|tion
from the affairs of men. Nay, for
the mo&s;t part, it will be cultivated with
greater &s;ucce&s;s by tho&s;e who mingle it
with the active employments of life. For
the mind, when entirely occupied by any
one object, is in hazard of viewing it at
la&s;t through a fal&s;e medium. Objects,
e&s;pecially, &s;o great and &s;ublime as tho&s;e
of devotion, when we attempt to fix upon
them unremitting attention, over&s;tretch
and di&s;order our feeble powers. The
<PB N="297" REF="306">
mind, by being relaxed, returns to them
with more advantage. As none of our
organs can bear inten&s;e $$n&s;ations, with|out
injury; as the eye, when dazzled
with overpowering light, beholds ima|ginary
colours, and lo&s;es the real di|&s;tinction
of objects; &s;o the mind, when
over-heated by perpetual contemplation
of cele&s;tial things, has been &s;ometimes
found to mi&s;take the &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions
of fancy, for &s;upernatural communica|tions
from above. To the employments
of devotion, as to all other things, there
are due limits. There is a certain tem|perate
&s;phere, within which, it pre&s;erves
longe&s;t its proper exertion, and mo&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;sfully
promotes the purpo&s;es for which
it was de&s;igned.</P>
<P>IN the fourth place, It is an error to
imagine, that devotion enjoins a total
contempt of all the plea&s;ures and amu&s;e|ments
of human &s;ociety. It checks, in|deed,
that &s;pirit of di&s;&s;ipation which is
too prevalent. It not only prohibits plea|&s;ures
<PB N="298" REF="307">
which are unlawful, but likewi&s;e
that unlawful degree of attachment to
plea&s;ures in them&s;elves innocent, which
withdraws the attention of men from
what is &s;erious and important. But $word$
brings amu&s;ement under due limitation,
without extirpating it. It forbids it, as
the bu&s;ine&s;s; but permits it, as the relaxa|tion,
of life. For there is nothing in the
&s;pirit of true religion, which is ho&s;tile to
a chearful enjoyment of our &s;ituation in
the world.</P>
<P>They who look with a &s;evere and in|dignant
eye, upon all the recreations by
which the cares of men are relieved, and
the union of &s;ociety is cemented, are, in
two re&s;pects, injurious to religion. Fir&s;t,
they exhibit it to others under a for|bidding
form, by cloathing it with the
garb of &s;o much unnece&s;&s;ary au&s;terity.
And, next, they deprive the world of
the benefit which their example might
afford, in drawing the line between in|nocent
and dangerous plea&s;ures. By a
temperate participation of tho&s;e which
<PB N="299" REF="308">
are innocent, they might &s;ucce&s;sfully ex|ert
that authority, which a virtuous and
re&s;pectable character always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, in
re&s;training undue exce&s;s. They would
&s;how the young and unwary, at what
point they ought to &s;top. They would
have it in their power, to regulate, in
&s;ome degree, the publick manners; to
check extravagance, to humble pre&s;ump|tion,
and put vice to the blu&s;h. But,
through injudicious &s;everity, they fall
&s;hort of the good they might perform.
By an indi&s;criminate cen&s;ure of all a|mu&s;ement,
they detract from the weight
of their reproof, when amu&s;ement be|comes
undoubtedly &s;inful. By totally
withdrawing them&s;elves from the circle
of chearful life, they deliver up the en|tertainments
of &s;ociety into the hands of
the loo&s;e, and the corrupted; and permit
the blind power of fa&s;hion, uncontroul|ed,
to e&s;tabli&s;h its own &s;tandards, and
to exerci&s;e its dangerous &s;way over the
world.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="309">
IN the fifth place, It is an error to
believe, that devotion nouri&s;hes a &s;pirit
of &s;everity, in judging of the manners
and characters of others. Under this re|proach,
iudeed, it has &s;o long &s;uffered in
the world; that, with too many, the ap|pellation
of devout, &s;ugge&s;ts no other cha|racter,
but that of a four and reclu&s;e
bigot, who delights in cen&s;ure. But the
reproach is unju&s;t; for &s;uch a &s;pirit is
entirely oppo&s;ite to the nature of true de|votion.
'I'he very fir&s;t traces which it
imprints on the mind, are candour and
humility. Its principles are liberal. Its
genius is una&s;&s;uming and mild. Severe
only to it&s;elf, it makes every allowance
for others which humanity can &s;ugge&s;t.
It claims no privilege of looking into
their hearts, or of deciding with re&s;pect
to their eternal &s;tate.&mdash;If your &s;uppo&s;ed
devotion produce contrary effects; if it
infu&s;e har&s;hne&s;s into your &s;entiments,
and acrimony into your &s;peech; you
may conclude, that, under a &s;erious ap|pearance,
carnal pa&s;&s;ions lurk. And, if
<PB N="301" REF="310">
ever it &s;hall &s;o far lift you up with &s;elf|conceit,
as to make you e&s;tabli&s;h your
own opinions as an infallible &s;tandard
for the whole Chri&s;tian world, and lead
you to con&s;ign to perdition all who differ
from you, either in &s;ome doctrinal tenets,
or in the mode of expre&s;&s;ing them; you
may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that to much pride you
have joined much ignorance, both of the
nature of devotion, and of the Go&s;pel of
Chri&s;t. Finally,</P>
<P>IN the &s;ixth place, It is an error to
think, that perpetual rapture and &s;piritual
joy belong to devotion. Devout feelings
admit very different degrees of warmth
and exaltation. Some per&s;ons, by the
frame of their minds, are much more
&s;u&s;ceptible than others, of the tender
emotions. They more readily relent at
the view of Divine goodne&s;s, glow with
a warmer ardour of love, and, by con&s;e|quence,
ri&s;e to a higher elevation of joy
and hope. But in the mid&s;t of &s;till and
calm affections, devotion often dwells;
<PB N="302" REF="311">
and though it produce no tran&s;ports in
the mind, diffu&s;es over it a &s;teady &s;ere|nity.
Devout &s;en&s;ations not only vary
in their degree, according to the frame
of different tempers; but, even among
the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ed, &s;uffer much interrup|tion
and decay. It were too much to
expect, that in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of human
frailty, tho&s;e happy feelings &s;hould be
uniform and con&s;tant. Oppre&s;&s;ion of
worldly cares, languor of &s;pirits, and
infirmities of bodily health, frequently
indi&s;po&s;e us for the enjoyment of devout
affections. Pious men, on the&s;e occa&s;ions,
are in hazard of pa&s;&s;ing judgment on
their own &s;tate with too much &s;everity;
as if, for &s;ome great iniquity, they were
condemned by God to final hardne&s;s of
heart. Hence ari&s;es that melancholy,
which has been &s;een to overcloud them;
and which has given occa&s;ion to many
contemptuous &s;coffs of ungodly men. But
it is a melancholy which de&s;erves to be
treated with tenderne&s;s, not with con|tempt.
It is the exce&s;s of virtuous and
<PB N="303" REF="312">
pious &s;en&s;ibility. It is the overflowing of
a heart affected, in an extreme degree,
with the humble &s;en&s;e of its own failings,
and with ardent concern to attain the fa|vour
of God. A weakne&s;s, however, we
admit it to be, though not a crime; and
hold it to be perfectly &s;eparable from
the e&s;&s;ence of devotion. For contrition,
though it may melt, ought not to &s;ink
or overpower, the heart of a Chri&s;tian.
The tear of repentance leads to its own
relief. Religion is a &s;pring of con&s;ola|tion,
not of terrour, to every well inform|ed
mind, which, in a proper manner, re&s;ts
its hope on the infinite goodne&s;s of God,
and the all-&s;ufficient merit of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>To conclude, Let us remove from devo|tion
all tho&s;e mi&s;takes, to which the cor|ruptions
of men, or their ignorance and
prejudices, have given ri&s;e. With us, let
it be the wor&s;hip of God <HI>in &s;pirit and in
truth;</HI> the elevation of the &s;oul towards
him, in &s;implicity and love. Let us pur&s;ue
it is the principle of virtuous conduct, and
<PB N="304" REF="313">
of inward peace. By frequent and &s;erious
meditation on the great objects of reli|gion,
let us lay our&s;elves open to its in|fluence.
By means of the in&s;titutions of
the Go&s;pel, let us cheri&s;h its impre&s;&s;ions.
And, above all, let us pray to God, that
he may e&s;tabli&s;h its power in our heart.
For here, if any where, his a&s;&s;i&s;tance is
requi&s;ite. The &s;pirit of devotion is his
gift. From his in&s;piration it proceeds.
Towards him it tends; and in his pre|&s;ence
hereafter, it &s;hall attain its full per|fection.</P>

<P>SOBRIETY of mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XI.</NOTE> is one of tho&s;e
virtues: which the pre&s;ent condition

vigilance, and &s;elf-government, are duties
incumbent on all; but e&s;pecially, on &s;uch
as are beginning the journey of life.
To them, therefore, the admonition in
the Text is, with great propriety, direct|ed;
though there is rea&s;on to fear, that
<PB N="306" REF="315">
by them it is in hazard of being lea&s;t

on the mo&s;t giddy, after they
have advanced in years. But the whole
&s;tate of youthful views and pa&s;&s;ions, is
adver&s;e to &s;obriety of mind. The &s;cenes

Whatever they be in them&s;elves, the lively

Impelled by de&s;ire, forward they ru&s;h

&s;en&s;e, as including the whole of

in a preceeding ver&s;e to the other &s;ex, the
in&s;tructions which ari&s;e from the Text, are
to be con&s;idered as common to both. I
intend, fir&s;t, to &s;how them the importance
of beginning early to give &s;erious atten|tion
to their conduct; and, next, to point
out tho&s;e virtues which they ought chief|ly
to cultivate.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as you are capable of reflec|tion,
you mu&s;t perceive that there is a
right and a wrong, in human actions.
You &s;ee, that tho&s;e who are born with
the &s;ame advantages of fortune, are not
all equally pro&s;perous in the cour&s;e of life.
While &s;ome of them, by wi&s;e and &s;teady
conduct, attain di&s;tinction in the world,
and pa&s;s their days with comfort and ho|nour;
others of the &s;ame rank, by mean
and vicious behaviour, forfeit the advan|tages
of their birth, involve, them&s;elves in
much mi&s;ery, and end in being a di&s;|grace
<PB N="308" REF="317">
to their friends, and a burden on
&s;ociety. Early, then, you may learn, that
it is not on the external condition, in
which you find your&s;elves placed, but on
the part which you are to act, that your
welfare or unhappine&s;s, your honour or
infamy, depend. Now, when beginning
to act that part, what can be of greater
moment, than to regulate your plan of
conduct with the mo&s;t &s;erious attention,
before you have yet committed any fatal
or irretrievable errors? If, in&s;tead of ex|erting
reflection for this valuable pur|po&s;e,
you deliver your&s;elves up, at &s;o cri|tical

which is required of others? Shall
happine&s;s grow up to you, of its own ac|cord,

to the re&s;t of mankind, it is the fruit of
long cultivation, and the acqui&s;ition of
labour and care?&mdash;Deceive not your|&s;elves

for your &s;ake, rever&s;e its e&s;tabli&s;hed or|der.
The Author of your being hath en|joined
you to <HI>take heed to your ways; to
ponder the paths of your feet; to remember

thought, you may en&s;ure chearfulne&s;s for
<PB N="310" REF="319">
the re&s;t of life; but by delivering your|&s;elves
up at pre&s;ent to giddine&s;s and le|vity,
you lay the foundation of la&s;ting
heavine&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>When you look forward to tho&s;e plans
of life, which either your circum&s;tances
have &s;ugge&s;ted, or your friends have pro|po&s;ed,
you will not he&s;itate to acknow|ledge,
that in order to pur&s;ue them with
advantage, &s;ome previous di&s;cipline is re|qui&s;ite.
Be a&s;&s;ured, that whatever is to
be your profe&s;&s;ion, no education is more
nece&s;&s;ary to your &s;ucce&s;s, than the ac|quirement
of virtuous di&s;po&s;itions and
habits. This is the univer&s;al preparation
for every character, and every &s;tation
in life. Bad as the world is, re&s;pect is
always paid to virtue. In the u&s;ual cour&s;e
of human affairs, it will be found, that
a plain under&s;tanding joined with ac|knowledged
worth, contributes more to
pro&s;perity, than the brighte&s;t parts with|out
probity or honour. Whether &s;cience,
or bu&s;ine&s;s, or publick life, be your aim,
virtue &s;till enters, for a principal &s;hare, in|to
<PB N="311" REF="320">
to all tho&s;e great departments of human
action. It is connected with eminence
in every liberal art; with reputation in
every branch of fair and u&s;eful bu&s;ine&s;s;
with di&s;tinction in every publick &s;tation.
The vigour which it gives the mind, and
the weight which it adds to character;
the generous &s;entiments which it breathes,
the undaunted &s;pirit which it in&s;pires,
the ardour of diligence which it quickens,
the freedom which it procures from per|nicious
and di&s;honourable avocations, are
the foundations of all that is high in fame,
or great in &s;ucce&s;s, among men.</P>
<P>Whatever ornamental or engaging en|dowments
you now po&s;&s;e&s;s, virtue is a
nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;ite, in order to their &s;hin|ing
with proper lu&s;tre. Feeble are the
attractions of the faire&s;t form, if it be
&s;u&s;pected that nothing within, corre&s;ponds
to the plea&s;ing appearance without. Short
are the triumphs of wit, when it is &s;up|po&s;ed
to be the vehicle of malice. By
whatever arts you may at fir&s;t attract the
attention, you can hold the e&s;teem, and
<PB N="312" REF="321">
&s;ecure the hearts of others, only by ami|able
di&s;po&s;itions, and the improvements of
the mind. The&s;e are the qualities who&s;e
influence will la&s;t, when the lu&s;tre of all
that once &s;parkled and dazzled, has pa&s;&s;ed
away.</P>
<P>Let not then the &s;ea&s;on of youth be
barren of improvements, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to
your future felicity and honour. Now is
the &s;eed-time of life; and according to
<HI>what you sow, you &s;hall reap.</HI> Your cha|racter
is now, under divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, of
your own forming; your fate is, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, put into your own hands. Your
nature is as yet pliant and &s;oft. Habits
have not e&s;tabli&s;hed their dominion. Pre|judices
have not pre-occupied your un|der&s;tanding.
The world has not had time
to contract and deba&s;e your affections.
All your powers are more vigorous, di&s;|embara&s;&s;ed
and free, than they will be
at any future period. Whatever impul&s;e
you now give to your de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions,
the direction is likely to continue. It
will form the channel in which your life
<PB N="313" REF="322">
is to run; nay, it may determine its ever|la&s;ting
i&s;&s;ue. Con&s;ider then the employ|ment
of this important period, as the
highe&s;t tru&s;t which &s;hall ever be com|mitted
to you; as, in a great mea&s;ure,
deci&s;ive of your happine&s;s, in time and
in eternity. As in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the
&s;ea&s;ons, each, by the invariable laws of
Nature, affects the productions of what
is next in cour&s;e; &s;o, in human life, every
period of our age, according as it is well
or ill &s;pent, influences the happine&s;s of
that which is to follow. Virtuous youth
gradually brings forward accompli&s;hed
and flouri&s;hing manhood; and &s;uch man|hood
pa&s;&s;es of it&s;elf, without unea&s;ine&s;s,
into re&s;pectable and tranquil old age.
But when nature is turned out of its re|gular
cour&s;e, di&s;order takes place in the
moral, ju&s;t as in the vegetable world. If
the Spring put forth no blo&s;&s;oms, in
Summer there will be no beauty, and
in Autumn, no fruit. So, if youth be
trifled away without improvement, man|hood
will be contemptible, and old age
<PB N="314" REF="323">
mi&s;erable. If the beginnings of life have
been <HI>vanity,</HI> its latter end can be no other
than <HI>vexation of &s;pirit.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus &s;hown the importance of
beginning early to give &s;erious attention
to conduct, I come, next, to point out the
virtues which are mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be cul|tivated
in youth. What I &s;hall,</P>
<P>I. RECOMMEND, is piety to God. With
this I begin, both as the foundation of
good morals, and as a di&s;po&s;ition particu|larly
graceful and becoming in youth. To
be void of it, argues a cold heart, de&s;titute
of &s;ome of the be&s;t affections which belong
to that age. Youth is the &s;ea&s;on of warm
and generous emotions. The heart &s;hould
then, &s;pontaneou&s;ly, ri&s;e into the admira|tion
of what is great, glow with the love
of what is fair and excellent, and melt at
the di&s;covery of tenderne&s;s and goodne&s;s.
Where can any object be found &s;o proper
to kindle tho&s;e affections, as the Father of
the univer&s;e, and the Author of all feli|city?
Unmoved by veneration, can you
<PB N="315" REF="324">
contemplate that grandeur and maje&s;ty,
which his works every where di&s;play?
Untouched by gratitude, can you view
that profu&s;ion of good, which, in this
plea&s;ing &s;ea&s;on of life, his beneficent hand
pours around you? Happy in the love
and affection of tho&s;e with whom you
are connected, look up to the Supreme
Being, as the in&s;pirer of all the friend|&s;hip
which has ever been &s;hown you by
others; him&s;elf, your be&s;t and mo&s;t an|tient
friend; formerly, the &s;upporter of
your infancy, and the guide of your
childhood; now, the guardian of your
youth, and the hope of your coming
years. View religious homage, as a na|tural
expre&s;&s;ion of gratitude to him for
all his goodne&s;s. Con&s;ider it as the &s;er|vice
of the <HI>God of your fathers;</HI> of him,
to whom your parents devoted you; of
him, whom in former ages your ance&s;tors
honoured; and by whom they are now
rewarded, and ble&s;&s;ed in heaven. Con|nected
with &s;o many tender &s;en&s;ibilities
of &s;oul, let religion be with you, not the
<PB N="316" REF="325">
cold and barren offspring of &s;peculation,
but the warm and vigorous dictate of the
heart.</P>
<P>But though piety chiefly belong to the
heart, yet the aid of the under&s;tanding is
requi&s;ite, to give a proper direction to the
devout affections. You mu&s;t endeavour,
therefore, to acquire ju&s;t views, both of
the great principles of natural religion,
and of the peculiar doctrines of the go&s;pel.
For this end, &s;tudy the &s;acred &s;criptures.
Con&s;ult the word of God, more than the
&s;y&s;tems of men, if you would know the
truth in its native purity. When, upon
rational and &s;ober enquiry, you have e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
your principles, &s;uffer them not
to be &s;haken, by the &s;coffs of the licen|tious,
or the cavils of the &s;ceptical. Re|member,
that in the examination of eve|ry
great and comprehen&s;ive plan, &s;uch as
that of Chri&s;tianity, difficulties may be ex|pected
to occur; and that rea&s;onable evi|dence
is not to be rejected, becau&s;e the na|ture
of our pre&s;ent &s;tate allows us only to
<HI>know in part, and to &s;ee through a gla&s;s darkly.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="326">
Impre&s;s your minds with reverence for
all that is &s;acred. Let no wantonne&s;s of
youthful &s;pirits, no compliance with the
intemperate mirth of others, ever betray
you into &s;allies of profanity. Be&s;ides the
guilt which is thereby incurred, nothing
gives a more odious appearance of petu|lance
and pre&s;umption to youth, than the
affectation of treating religion with levi|ty.
In&s;tead of being an evidence of &s;u|periour
under&s;tanding, it betrays a pert
and &s;hallow mind; which, vain of the
fir&s;t &s;matterings of knowledge, pre&s;umes
to make light of what the re&s;t of mankind
revere.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, you are not to ima|gine,
that when exhorted to be religious,
you are called upon, to become more for|mal
and &s;olemn in your manners than
others of the &s;ame years, or to erect your|&s;elves
into &s;upercilious reprovers of tho&s;e
around you. The &s;pirit of true religion
breathes gentlene&s;s and affability. It gives
a native, unaffected ea&s;e to the behaviour.
It is &s;ocial, kind, and chearful; far re|moved
<PB N="318" REF="327">
from that gloomy and illiberal &s;u|per&s;tition
which clouds the brow, &s;harpens
the temper, dejects the &s;pirit, and teaches
men to fit them&s;elves for another world,
by neglecting the concerns of this. Let
your religion, on the contrary, connect
preparation for heaven, with an honour|able
di&s;charge of the duties of active life.
Let it be a&s;&s;ociated in your imagination,
with all that is manly and u&s;eful; with
<HI>what&s;oever things are true, are ju&s;t, are
pure, are lovely, are of good report;</HI> where|ever
there is <HI>any virtue,</HI> and wherever there
is <HI>any prai&s;e.</HI> Of &s;uch religion di&s;cover,
on every proper occa&s;ion, that you are not
a&s;hamed; but avoid making any unnecce&s;|&s;ary
oftentation of it before the world.</P>
<P>II. To piety, join mode&s;ty and docility,
reverence of your parents, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
to tho&s;e who are your &s;uperiours in know|ledge,
in &s;tation, and in years. Depend|ance
and obedience belong to youth.
Mode&s;ty is one of its chief ornaments;
and has ever been e&s;teemed a pre&s;age of
<PB N="319" REF="328">
ri&s;ing merit. When entering on the ca|reer
of life, it is your part, not to a&s;&s;ume
the reins as yet into your hands, but to
commit your&s;elves to the guidance of the
more experienced; and to become wi&s;e by
the wi&s;dom of tho&s;e who have gone be|fore
you.</P>
<P>Of all the follies incident to youth,
there are none which either deform its
pre&s;ent appearance, or bla&s;t the pro&s;pect
of its future pro&s;perity, more than &s;elf|conceit,
pre&s;umption, and ob&s;tinacy. By
checking its natural progre&s;s in improve|ment,
they fix it in long immaturity;
and frequently produce mi&s;chiefs, which
can never be repaired. Yet the&s;e are vices
too commonly found among the young.
Big with enterpri&s;e, and elated by hope,
they re&s;olve to tru&s;t for &s;ucce&s;s to none
but them&s;elves. Full of their own abili|ties,
they deride the admonitions which
are given them by their friends, as the
timorous &s;ugge&s;tions of age. Too wi&s;e
to learn, too impatient to deliberate, too
forward to be re&s;trained, they plunge,
<PB N="320" REF="329">
with precipitant indi&s;cretion, into the
mid&s;t of all the dangers with which 1ife
abounds. <HI>See&s;t thou a</HI> young <HI>man wi&s;e in
his own conceit? There is more hope of a
fool, than of him.</HI>&mdash;Po&s;itive as you now
are in your opinions, and confident in
your a&s;&s;ertions, be a&s;&s;ured, that the time
approaches, when both men and things
will appear to you in a different light.
Many characters which you now admire,
will, by and by, &s;ink in your e&s;teem; and
many opinions, of which you are at pre|&s;ent
mo&s;t tenacious, will alter with ad|vancing
years. Di&s;tru&s;t, therefore, that
glare of youthful pre&s;umption, which
dazzles your eyes. Abound not in your
own &s;en&s;e. Put not your&s;elves forward
with too much eagerne&s;s; nor imagine,
that by the impetuo&s;ity of juvenile ar|dour,
you can overturn &s;y&s;tems which
have been long e&s;tabli&s;hed, and change
the face of the world. <HI>Learn not to think
more highly of your&s;elves than you ought to
think, but to think &s;oberly.</HI> By patient and
gradual progre&s;&s;ion in improvement, you
<PB N="321" REF="330">
may, in due time, command la&s;ting e&s;teem.
But by a&s;&s;uming, at pre&s;ent, a tone of &s;u|periority,
to which you have no title, you
will di&s;gu&s;t tho&s;e who&s;e approbation it is
mo&s;t important to gain. Forward viva|city
may fit you to be the companions of
an idle hour. More &s;olid qualities mu&s;t
recommend you to the wi&s;e, and mark
you out for importance and con&s;idera|tion,
in &s;ub&s;equent life.</P>
<P>III. IT is nece&s;&s;ary to recommend to
you, &s;incerity and truth. This is the ba&s;is
of every virtue. That darkne&s;s of charac|ter,
where we can &s;ee no heart; tho&s;e fold|ings
of art, through which no native af|fection
is allowed to penetrate, pre&s;ent an
object, unamiable in every &s;ea&s;on of life,
but particularly odious in youth. If at
an age, when the heart is warm, when the
emotions are &s;trong, and when nature is
expected to &s;how it&s;elf free and open, you
can already &s;mile and deceive, what are
we to look for, when you &s;hall be longer
hackneyed in the ways of men; when
<PB N="322" REF="331">
intere&s;t &s;hall have compleated the obdu|ration
of your heart, and experience &s;hall
have improved you in all the arts of guile?
Di&s;&s;imulation in youth, is the fore-runner
of perfidy in old age. Its fir&s;t appearance
is the fatal omen of growing depravity,
and future &s;hame. It degrades parts and
learning; ob&s;cures the lu&s;tre of every ac|compli&s;hment;
and &s;inks you into con|tempt
with God, and man.</P>
<P>As you value, therefore, the approba|tion
of Heaven, or the e&s;teem of the world,
cultivate the love of truth. In all your pro|ceedings,
be direct and con&s;i&s;tent. Inge|nuity
and candour po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t power|ful
charm; they be&s;peak univer&s;al &s;avour,
and carry an apology almo&s;t for every
failing. <HI>The lip of truth, &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed
for ever; but a lying tongue, is but for a mo|ment.</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">Prov. xii. 19.</NOTE>
The path of truth, is a plain and
a &s;afe path; that of fal&s;ehood, is a per|plexing
miaze. After the fir&s;t departure
from &s;incerity, it is not in your power to
&s;top. One artifice unavoidably leads on
to another; till, as the intricacy of the
<PB N="323" REF="332">
labyrinth thickens, you are left entangled
in your own &s;nare. Deceit di&s;covers a lit|tle
mind, which &s;tops at temporary expe|dients,
without ri&s;ing to comprehen&s;ive
views of conduct. It betrays, at the &s;ame
time, a da&s;tardly &s;pirit. It is the re&s;ource
of one, who wants courage to avow his
de&s;igns, or to re&s;t upon him&s;elf. Whereas,
openne&s;s of character di&s;plays that gene|rous
boldne&s;s, which ought to di&s;tingui&s;h
youth. To &s;et out in the world with no
other principle than a crafty attention to
intere&s;t, betokens one who is de&s;tined for
creeping through the inferiour walks of
life. But to give an early preference to
honour above gain, when they &s;tand in
competition; to de&s;pi&s;e every advantage,
which cannot be attained without di&s;|hone&s;t
arts; to brook no meanne&s;s, and
to &s;toop to no di&s;&s;imulation; are the in|dications
of a great mind, the prefages of
future eminence and di&s;tinction in life.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, this virtuous &s;ince|rity
is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t
prudent vigilance and caution. It is op|po&s;ed
<PB N="324" REF="333">
to cunning, not to true wi&s;dom.
It is not the &s;implicity of a weak and im|provident,
but the candour of an enlarged
and noble mind; of one, who &s;corns de|ceit,
becau&s;e he accounts it both ba&s;e and
unprofitable; and who &s;eeks no di&s;gui&s;e,
becau&s;e he needs none to hide him. <HI>Lord!
Who &s;hall abide in thy tabernacle? Who &s;hall
a&s;cend into thy holy hill? He that walketh
uprightly, and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s, and
&s;peaketh the truth in his heart.</HI></P>
<P>IV. YOUTH is the proper &s;ea&s;on of
cultivating the benevolent, and humane
affections. As a great part of your hap|pine&s;s
is to depend on the connections
which you form with others, it is of high
importance that you acquire, betimes, the
temper and the manners which will ren|der
&s;uch connections comfortable. Let a
&s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice be the foundation of all
your &s;ocial qualities. In your mo&s;t early
intercour&s;e with the world, and even in
your youthful amu&s;ements, let no unfair|ne&s;s
be found. Engrave on your mind
<PB N="325" REF="334">
that &s;acred rule, of <HI>doing in all things to
others, according as you wi&s;h that they
&s;hould do unto you.</HI> For this end, impre&s;s
your&s;elves with a deep &s;en&s;e of the origi|nal,
and natural, equality of men. What|ever
advantages of birth or fortune you
po&s;&s;e&s;s, never di&s;play them with an often|tatious
&s;uperiority. Leave the &s;ubordi|nations
of rank, to regulate the intercour&s;e
of more advanced years. At pre&s;ent, it
becomes you to act among your compa|nions,
as man with man. Remember how
unknown to you are the vici&s;&s;itudes of
the world; and how often they, on whom
ignorant and contemptuous young men
once looked down with &s;corn, have ri&s;en
to be their &s;uperiours in future years.</P>
<P>Compa&s;&s;ion is an emotion, of which
you ought never to be a&s;hamed. Grace|ful
in youth is the tear of &s;ympathy, and
the heart that melts at the tale of woe.
Let not ea&s;e and indulgence contract your
affections, and wrap you up in &s;elfi&s;h en|joyment.
But go &s;ometimes to the <HI>house of mourning?</HI> as well as <HI>to the hou&s;e of fea&s;t|ing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="335">
Accu&s;tom your&s;elves to think of the
di&s;tre&s;&s;es of human life; of the &s;olitary
cottage, the dying parent, and the weep|ing
orphan. <HI>Thou &s;hall not harden thy
heart, nor &s;hut thy hand from thy poor bro|ther;
but thou &s;hall &s;urely give unto him in
the day of his need: And thine heart &s;hall
not be grieved when thou give&s;t unto him,
becau&s;e that for this thing, the Lord thy God
&s;hall ble&s;s thee in all thy works.</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">Deut. xv. 7, 10.</NOTE>
Never &s;port with pain and di&s;tre&s;s, in any of
your amu&s;ements; nor treat even the
meane&s;t infect, with wanton cruelty.</P>
<P>In young minds, there is common|ly
a &s;trong propen&s;ity to particular in|timacies
and friend&s;hips. Youth, in|deed,
is the &s;ea&s;on when friend&s;hip are
&s;ometimes formed, which not only con|tinue
through &s;ucceeding life, but which
glow to the la&s;t, with a tenderne&s;s un|known
to the connections begun in cooler
years. The propen&s;ity therefore is not to
be di&s;couraged; though at the &s;ame time it
mu&s;t be regulated with much circum&s;pec|tion
and care. Too many of the pretended
<PB N="327" REF="336">
friend&s;hips of youth, are mere combina|tions
in plea&s;ure. Often they are found|ed
on capricious likings; &s;uddenly con|tracted,
and as &s;uddenly di&s;&s;olved. Some|times
they are the effect of intere&s;ted com|plai&s;ance
and flattery on the one &s;ide, and
of credulous fondne&s;s on the other. Beware
of &s;uch ra&s;h and dangerous connections,
which may afterwards load you with di&s;|honour.
Remember, that by the charac|ter
of tho&s;e whom you choo&s;e for your
friends, your own is likely to be formed,
and will certainly be judged of by the
world. Be &s;low, therefore, and cautious
in contracting intimacy; but when a vir|tuous
friend&s;hip is once e&s;tabli&s;hed, con|&s;ider
it as a &s;acred engagement. Expo&s;e
not your&s;elves to the reproach of lightne&s;s
and incon&s;tancy, which always be&s;peak,
either a trifling, or a ba&s;e mind. Reveal
none of the &s;ecrets of your friend. Be
faithful to his intere&s;ts. For&s;ake him not
in danger. Abhor the thought of ac|quiring
any advantage by his prejudice
or hurt. <HI>There is a friend that loveth at
<PB N="328" REF="337">
all times, and a brother that is born for ad|ver&s;ity.
Thine own friend, and thy father's
Friend, for&s;ake not</HI><NOTE PLACE="foot">Prov. xvii. 17.&mdash;xxvii. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>Finally, on this head; in order to ren|der
your&s;elves amiable in &s;ociety, &s;ubdue
all har&s;hne&s;s of behaviour. Let that cour|te&s;y
appear in your demeanour, which
&s;prings not &s;o much from &s;tudied polite|ne&s;s,
as from a mild and gentle heart.
Follow the cu&s;toms of the world in mat|ters
indifferent; but &s;top when they be|come
&s;inful. Let your manners be &s;im|ple
and natural; and of cour&s;e they will
be engaging. Affectation is certain de|formity.
By forming them&s;elves on fan|ta&s;tick
models, and vying with one ano|ther
in every reigning folly, the young
begin with being ridiculous, and end in
being vitious and immoral.</P>
<P>V. LET me particularly exhort youth,
to temperance in plea&s;ure: Let me admo|ni&s;h
them, to beware of that rock on which
thou&s;ands, from race to race, continue to
&s;plit. The love of plea&s;ure, natural to
<PB N="329" REF="338">
man in every period of his life, glows at
this age with exce&s;&s;ive ardour. Novelty
adds fre&s;h charms, as yet, to every grati|fication.
The world appears to &s;pread a
continual fea&s;t; and health, vigour, and
high &s;pirits, invite them to partake of it
without re&s;traint. In vain we warn them
of latent dangers. Religion is accu&s;ed of
in&s;ufferable &s;everity, in precluding enjoy|ment;
and the old, when they offer their
admonitions, are upbraided with having
forgot that they once were young.&mdash;And
yet, my friends, to what do the re&s;traints
of religion, and the coun&s;els of age, with
re&s;pect to plea&s;ure, amount? They may
all be comprized in two words, not to
hurt your&s;elves, and not to hurt others,
by your pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure. Within the&s;e
bounds, plea&s;ure is lawful; beyond them,
it becomes criminal, becau&s;e it is ruinous.
Are the&s;e re&s;traints any other, than what
a wi&s;e man would choo&s;e to impo&s;e on
him&s;elf? We call you not to renounce
plea&s;ure, but to enjoy it in &s;afety. In|&s;tead
of abridging it, we exhort you to
<PB N="330" REF="339">
pur&s;ue it on an exten&s;ive plan. We pro|po&s;e
mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
and prolonging its duration.</P>
<P>Con&s;ult your whole nature. Con&s;ider
your&s;elves not only as &s;en&s;itive, but as
rational beings; not only as rational, but
&s;ocial; not only as &s;ocial, but immortal.
Whatever violates your nature in any of
the&s;e re&s;pects, cannot afford true plea&s;ure;
any more than that can promote health,
which undermines an e&s;&s;ential part of the
vital &s;y&s;tem. For the truth of this con|clu&s;ion,
we appeal not merely to the au|thority
of religion, nor to the te&s;timony
of the aged, but to your&s;elves, and your
own experience. We a&s;k, Whether you
have not found, that in a cour&s;e of cri|minal
exce&s;s, your plea&s;ure was more
than compen&s;ated by &s;ucceeding pain;
Whether, if not from every particular
in&s;tance, yet from every habit, at lea&s;t,
of unlawful gratification, there did not
&s;pring &s;ome thorn to wound you, there
did not ari&s;e &s;ome con&s;equence to make
you repent of it in the i&s;&s;ue? <HI>How long
<PB N="331" REF="340">
then, ye &s;imple ones! will $word$ &s;implicity?</HI>
How long repeat the &s;ame $word$ of per|nicious
folly, and tamely expo&s;e your|&s;elves
to be caught in the &s;ame &s;nare? If
you have any con&s;ideration, or any firm|ne&s;s
left, avoid temptations, for which you
have found your&s;elves unequal, with as
much care, as you would &s;hun pe&s;tilential
infection. Break off all connections with
the loo&s;e and pro&s;ligate. <HI>When &s;inners entice
thee, con&s;ent thou not. Look not on the wine

<P>How many amiable and promi&s;ing qua|lities
in youth, are extingui&s;hed by the un|happy

<P>VI. DILIGENCE, indu&s;try, and proper
improvement of time, are material duties
of the young. To no purpo&s;e are they
endowed with the be&s;t abilities, if they
want activity for exerting them. Un|availing,
<PB N="333" REF="342">
in this ca&s;e, will be every direc|tion
that can be given them, either for
their temporal or &s;piritual welfare. In
youth, the habits of indu&s;try are mo&s;t
ea&s;ily acquired. In youth, the incentives
to it are &s;tronge&s;t, from ambition and from
duty, from emulation and hope, from all
the pro&s;pects which the beginning of
life affords. If, dead to the&s;e calls, you
already langui&s;h in &s;lothful inaction,
what will be able to quicken the more
&s;luggi&s;h current of advancing years?</P>
<P>Indu&s;try is not only the in&s;trument of
improvement, but the foundation of plea|&s;ure.
Nothing is &s;o oppo&s;ite to the true
enjoyment of life, as the relaxed and
feeble &s;tate of an indolent mind. He
who is a &s;tranger to indu&s;try, may po&s;&s;e&s;s,
but he cannot enjoy. For it is labour
only which gives the reli&s;h to plea&s;ure.
It is the appointed vehicle of every good
to man. It is the indi&s;pen&s;ible condition
of our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;ound mind, in a &s;ound
body. Sloth is &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with both,
that it is hard to determine whether it be
<PB N="334" REF="343">
a greater foe to virtue, or to health and
happine&s;s. Inactive as it is in it&s;elf, it$
effects are fatally powerful. Though it
appear a &s;lowly flowing &s;tream, yet it un|dermines
all that is &s;table and flouri&s;hing.
It not only &s;aps the foundation of every
Virtue, but pours upon you a deluge of
crimes and evils. It is like water which
fir&s;t putrifies by &s;tagnation; and then
&s;ends up noxious vapours, and fills the
atmo&s;phere with death.</P>
<P>Fly, therefore, from idlene&s;s, as the
certain parent both of guilt and of ruin.
And under idlene&s;s I include, not mere
Inaction only, but all that circle of tri&s;l|ing
occupations, in which too many
&s;aunter away their youth; perpetually
engaged in frivolous &s;ociety, or public
amu&s;ements, in the labours of dre&s;s, or
the o&s;tentation of their per&s;on.&mdash;Is this
the foundation which you lay for future
u&s;efulne&s;s and e&s;teem? By &s;uch accom|pli&s;hments,
do you hope to recommend
your&s;elves to the thinking part of the
world, and to an&s;wer the expectations of
<PB N="335" REF="344">
your friends, and your country?&mdash;A|mu&s;ements,
youth requires. It were vain,
it were cruel, to prohibit them. But
though allowable as the relaxation, they
are mo&s;t culpable as the bu&s;ine&s;s, of the
young. For, they then become the gulf
of time, and the poi&s;on of the mind. They
foment bad pa&s;&s;ions. They weaken the
manly powers. They &s;ink the native vigour
of youth into contemptible effeminacy.</P>
<P>Redeeming your time from &s;uch dan|gerous
wa&s;te, &s;eek to fill it with em|ployments
which you may review with
&s;atisfaction. The acqui&s;ition of know|ledge,
is one of the mo&s;t honourable occu|pations
of youth. The de&s;ire of it, di&s;|covers
a liberal mind, and is connected with many accompli&s;hments, and many
virtues. But though your train of life
&s;hould not lead you to &s;tudy, the cour&s;e
of education always furni&s;hes proper
employments to a well-di&s;po&s;ed mind.
Whatever you pur&s;ue, be emulous to ex|cell.
Generous ambition, and &s;en&s;ibility to
prai&s;e, are, e&s;pecially at your age, among
<PB N="336" REF="345">
the marks of virtue. Think not, that
any affluence of fortune, or any elevation
of rank, exempts you from the duties of
application and indu&s;try. Indu&s;try is the
law of our being; it is the demand of Na|ture,
of Rea&s;on, and of God. Remember
always, that the years which now pa&s;s
over your heads, leave permanent memo|rials
behind them. From your thought|le&s;s
minds they may e&s;cape; but they re|main
in the remembrance of God. They
form an important part of the regi&s;ter of
your life. They will hereafter bear te&s;ti|mony,
either for or again&s;t you, at that
day, when, for all your actions, but par|ticularly
for the employments of youth,
you mu&s;t give an account to God.</P>
<P>THUS I have &s;et before you, &s;ome of
the chief qualifications which belong to
that <HI>&s;ober mind,</HI> that virtuous and religi|ous
character, which the Apo&s;tle in my
Text recommends to youth; piety, mo|de&s;ty,
truth, benevolence, temperance, and
indu&s;try. Whether your future cour&s;e is
<PB N="337" REF="346">
de&s;tined to be long or &s;hort, after this
manner it &s;hould commence; and, if it
continue to be thus conducted, its con|clu&s;ion,
at what time &s;oever it arrives,
will not be inglorious or unhappy. For,
<HI>honourable age it not that which &s;tandeth in
length of time, or that which is mea&s;ured by
number of years. But wisdom is the gray
hair to man, and an un&s;potted life is old age.</HI></P>
<P>LET me fini&s;h the &s;ubject, with recalling
your attention to that dependance on the
ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, which, amidst all your
endeavours after improvement, you ought
continually to preferve. It is too common
with the young, even when they re&s;olve
to tread the path of virtue and honour, to
&s;et out with pre&s;umptuous confidence in
them&s;elves. Tru&s;ting to their own abilities
for carrying them &s;ucce&s;sfully through life,
they are carele&s;s of applying to God,
or of deriving any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, from what
they are apt to reckon the gloomy di&s;ci|pline
of religion. Alas! how little do they
know the dangers which await them?
<PB N="338" REF="347">
Neither human wi&s;dom, nor human vir|true,
un&s;upported by religion, are equal
for the trying &s;ituations which often occur
in life. By the &s;hock of temptation, how
frequently have the mo&s;t virtuous inten|tions
been overthrown? Under the pre&s;|&s;ure
of di&s;a&s;ter, how often has the greate&s;t
con&s;tancy &s;unk? <HI>Every good, and every
perfect gift, is from above.</HI> Wi&s;dom and
virtue, as well as <HI>riches and honour, come
from God.</HI> De&s;titute of his favour, you
are in no better &s;ituation, with all your
boa&s;ted abilities, than orphans left to wan|der
in a tractle&s;s de&s;ert, without any guide
to conduct them, or any &s;helter to cover
them from the gathering &s;torm. Correct,
then, this ill-founded arrogance. Expect
not, that your happine&s;s can be indepen|dent
of him who made you. By faith
and repentance, apply to the Redeemer of
the world. By piety and prayer, &s;eek the
protection of the God of heaven. I con|clude
with the &s;olemn words, in which a
great Prince delivered his dying charge to
his &s;on; words, which every young per&s;on

a di&s;tinct propriety of behaviour.
There ari&s;es from it, a &s;eries of duties pe|culiar
to it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="350">
Of tho&s;e which are incumbent on youth,
I have treated in the preceeding di&s;cour&s;e.
As we advance from youth to middle age,
a new field of action opens, and a diffe|rent
character is required. The flow of
gay and impetuous &s;pirits, begins to &s;ub|&s;ide.
Life gradually a&s;&s;umes a graver ca&s;t;
the mind, a more &s;edate and thoughtful
turn. The attention is now transferred
from plea&s;ure to intere&s;t; that is, to plea|&s;ure
diffu&s;ed over a wider extent, and
mea&s;ured by a larger &s;cale. Formerly,
the enjoyment of the pre&s;ent moment
occupied the whole attention. Now, no
action terminates ultimately in it&s;elf, but
refers to &s;ome more di&s;tant aim. Wealth
and power, the in&s;truments of la&s;ting
gratification, are now coveted more than
any &s;ingle plea&s;ure. Prudence and fore|&s;ight
lay their plans. Indu&s;try carries
on its patient efforts. Activity pu&s;hes
forward; addre&s;s winds around. Here,
an enemy is to be overcome; there, a ri|val
to be di&s;placed. Competitions warm;
and the &s;trife of the world thickens on
<PB N="342" REF="351">
every &s;ide. To guide men through this
bu&s;y period, without lo&s;s of integrity; to
guard them again&s;t the temptations which
ari&s;e from mi&s;takcn, or interfering, inter|e&s;ts;
to recall them, from worldly pur|&s;uits,
to &s;erious thoughts of their &s;piritual
concerns, is the great office of religion.</P>
<P>But as this includes, in a great mea|&s;ure,
the whole compa&s;s of moral duty;
as the general &s;train of religious exhorta|tion,
is addre&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e who are in this
&s;ea&s;on of life; a delineation of the virtues,
properly belonging to middle age, may ap|pear
unnece&s;&s;ary, and would lead us into
too wide a field. Let us therefore turn
our view to a bounded pro&s;pect; and
contemplate a period of life, the duties of
which are circum&s;cribed within narrower
limits. Old age is a &s;tage of the human
cour&s;e, which every one hopes to reach;
and therefore the con&s;ideration of it, in|tere&s;ts
us all. It is a period ju&s;tly entitled
to general re&s;pect. Even its failings ought
to be touched with a gentle hand; and
though the petulant, and the vain, may
<PB N="343" REF="352">
de&s;pi&s;e <HI>the hoary head</HI> yet the wi&s;e&s;t of
men has a&s;&s;erted in the Text, that when
<HI>found in the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s, it is a
crown of glory.</HI> I &s;hall, fir&s;t, offer &s;ome
coun&s;els, concerning the errors which are
mo&s;t incident to the aged. Secondly, I
&s;hall &s;ugge&s;t the peculiar duties they
ought to practi&s;e; and, thirdly, Point out
the con&s;olations they may enjoy.</P>
<P>I. As the follies and vices of youth,
are chiefly derived from inexperience and
pre&s;umption; &s;o, almo&s;t all the errors of
age, may be traced up to the feeblene&s;s
and di&s;tre&s;s peculiar to that time of life.
Though, in every part of life, vexations
occur; yet, in former years, either bu&s;ine&s;s,
or plea&s;ure, &s;erved to obliterate their im|pre&s;&s;ion,
by &s;upplying occupation to the
mind. Old age begins its advances, with
di&s;qualifying men for reli&s;hing the one,
and for taking an active part in the other.
While it withdraws their accu&s;tomed &s;up|ports,
it impo&s;es, at the &s;ame time, the ad|ditional
burden of growing infirmities. In
<PB N="344" REF="353">
the former &s;tages of their journey, hope
continued to flatter them with many a
fair and enticing pro&s;pect. But in pro|portion
as old age increa&s;es, tho&s;e plea&s;ing
illu&s;ions vani&s;h. Life is contracted with|in
a narrow and barren circle. Year after
year, &s;teals &s;omewhat away from their
&s;tore of comfort; deprives them of &s;ome
of their ancient friends, blunts &s;ome of
their powers of &s;en&s;ation, or incapacitates
them for &s;ome function of life.</P>
<P>Though, in the plan of Providence, it
is wi&s;ely ordered, that before we are
called away from the world, our attach|ment
to it &s;hould be gradually loo&s;ened;
though it be fit in it&s;elf, that as in the
day of human life, there is a morning
and a noon, &s;o there &s;hould be an evening
al&s;o, when the lengthening &s;hadows &s;hall
admoni&s;h us of approaching night; yet
we have no rea&s;on to be &s;urprized, if they
who are arrived at this dejecting &s;ea&s;on,
feel and lament the change which they
&s;uffer. The complaints therefore of. the
aged, &s;hould meet with tenderne&s;s, rather
<PB N="345" REF="354">
than cen&s;ure. The burden under which
they labour ought to be viewed with
&s;ympathy, by tho&s;e who mu&s;t bear it in
their turn, and who perhaps, hereafter,
may complain of it as bitterly. At the
&s;ame time, the old &s;hould con&s;ider, that all
the &s;ea&s;ons of life have their &s;everal trials
allotted to them; and that to bear the in|firmities
of age with becoming patience,
is as much their duty, as it is that of the
young to re&s;i&s;t the temptations of youth|ful
plea&s;ure. By calmly enduring, for the
&s;hort time that remains, what Providence
is plea&s;ed to inflict, they both expre&s;s a
re&s;ignation mo&s;t acceptable to God, and
recommend them&s;elves to the e&s;teem and
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all who are around them.</P>
<P>But though the querulous temper im|puted
to old age, is to be considered as a
natural infirmity, rather than as a vice;
the &s;ame apology cannot be made for that
peevi&s;h di&s;gu&s;t at the manners, and that
malignant cen&s;ure of the enjoyments of
the young, which is &s;ometimes found to
accompany advancing years. Nothing
<PB N="346" REF="355">
can be more unju&s;t, than to take off|ence
at others, on account of their partaking
of plea&s;ures, which it is pa&s;t your time to
enjoy. By indulging this fretful temper,
you both aggravate the unea&s;ine&s;s of age,
and you alienate tho&s;e on whole affection
much of your comfort depends. In order
to make the two extremes of life unite in
amicable &s;ociety, it is greatly to be wi&s;h|ed,
that the young would look forward,
and con&s;ider that they &s;hall one day be
old; and that the old would look back,
and remembering that they once were
young, make proper allowances for the
temper and the manners of youth.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of this, it is too common
to find the aged, at declared enmity with
every thing that is pre&s;ent; perpetually
complaining of the growing depravity of
the world, and of the a&s;toni&s;hing vices
and follies of the ri&s;ing generation. All
things, according to them, are ru&s;hing
fa&s;t into ruin. Decency and good order
have become extinct, ever &s;ince that hap|py
di&s;cipline, under which they &s;pent
<PB N="347" REF="356">
their youth, has pa&s;&s;ed away.&mdash;Part, at
lea&s;t, of this di&s;plea&s;ure, you may fairly
impute to the infirmity of age, which
throws its own gloom on every &s;urround|ing
object. Similar lamentations were, in
the days of your youth, poured, forth by
your fathers; and they who are now
young, &s;hall, when it comes to their turn,
inveigh, in the like &s;train, again&s;t tho&s;e
who &s;ucceed them. Great has been the
corruption of the world in every age.
Sufficient ground there is for the com|plaints
made by &s;erious ob&s;ervers, at all
times, of abounding iniquity and folly.
But though particular modes of vice pre|vail
in one age, more than in others, it
does not follow, that on that age all ini|quity
is accumulated. It is the form&punc;
perhaps, more than the quantity of cor|ruption,
which makes the di&s;tinction. In
the wor&s;t of times, God has a&s; &s;ured us,
that there &s;hall be always <HI>a &s;eed who &s;hall
&s;erve him.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxii. 30.</NOTE> <HI>Say not thou, What is the cau&s;e
that the former days were better than the&s;e?
<PB N="348" REF="357">
for tbou do&s;t not enquire wi&s;ely concerning
this. Be righteous over-much; neither
make thy&s;elf over-wi&s;e.</HI><NOTE N="foot" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. vii. 10, 16.</NOTE> Former follies
pa&s;s away, and are forgotten. Tho&s;e
which are pre&s;ent, &s;trike ob&s;ervation, and
&s;harpen cen&s;ure. Had the depravation of
the world continued to increa&s;e in propor|tion
to tho&s;e gloomy calculations, which,
for &s;o many centuries pa&s;t, have e&s;timat|ed
each race as wor&s;e than the preceeding,
by this time, not one ray of good &s;en&s;e,
nor one &s;park of piety and virtue, mu&s;t
have remained unextingui&s;hed among
mankind.</P>
<P>One of the vices of old age, which ap|pears
the mo&s;t unaccountable, is that co|vetous
attachment to worldly intere&s;t,
with which it is often charged. But
this too, can naturally be deduced from
the &s;en&s;e of its feeblene&s;s and decay.
In proportion as the vigour both of bo|dy
and mind declines, timidity may
be expected to increa&s;e. With anxious
and fearful eye, the aged look forward
<PB N="349" REF="358">
to the evils which threaten them, and
to the changes which may befall. Hence,
they are &s;ometimes apt to over-value
riches, as the in&s;trument of their de|fence
again&s;t the&s;e dangers, and the mo&s;t
certain means of &s;ecuring them again&s;t
&s;olitude and di&s;re&s;pect. But though their
apprehen&s;ions may ju&s;tify a cautious fru|gality,
they can by no means excu&s;e a
fordid avarice. It is no le&s;s ab&s;urd,
than it is culpable, in the old, from the
dread of uncertain futurity, to deny them|&s;elves
the enjoyment of the pre&s;ent; and
to increa&s;e in anxiety about their jour|ney,
in proportion as it draws nearer to
its clo&s;e. There are more effectual me|thods
of commanding re&s;pect from the
world, than the mere po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of wealth.
Let them be charitable, and do good.
Let them mix beneficence to their friends,
with a chearful enjoyment of the com|forts
which befit their &s;tate. They will
then receive the returns of real re&s;pect
and love. Whereas, by their riches,
they procure no more than pretended
<PB N="350" REF="359">
demon&s;trations of regard; while their ill|judged
par&s;imony occa&s;ions many &s;ecret
wi&s;hes for their death.</P>
<P>As increa&s;ing years debilitate the bo|dy,
&s;o they weaken the force, and dimi|ni&s;h
the warmth of the affections. Chill|ed
by the hand of time, the heart lo&s;es
that tender &s;en&s;ibility, with which it once
entered into the concerns and &s;orrows of
others. It is, in truth, a merciful ap|pointment
of Providence, that as they
who &s;ee many days, mu&s;t behold many
a &s;ad &s;cene, the impre&s;&s;ions of grief upon
their heart &s;hould be blunted by being
often repeated; and that, in proportion
as their power of advancing the pro|&s;perity
of others decrea&s;es, their parti|cipation
of the misfortunes of others
&s;hould al&s;o le&s;&s;en. However, as, in eve|ry
period of life, humanity and friend|&s;hip
contribute to happine&s;s, it is both
the duty and the intere&s;t of the aged, to
cheri&s;h the remains of the kind affec|tions;
and, from the days of former
years, to recall &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions as may
<PB N="351" REF="360">
tend to &s;often their hearts. Let them
not, from having &s;uffered much in the
cour&s;e of their long pilgrimage, become
callous to the &s;ufferings of others. But
remembering that they &s;till are men, let
them &s;tudy to keep their heart open to
the &s;en&s;e of human woe. Practi&s;ed in
the ways of men, they are apt to be
&s;u&s;picious of dc&s;ign and fraud; for the
knowledge, and the di&s;tru&s;t of mankind,
too often go together. Let not, how|ever,
that wary caution, which is the
fruit of their experience, degenerate into
craft. Experience ought al&s;o to have
taught them, that amid&s;t all the fal&s;e|hood
of men, integrity is the be&s;t de|fence;
and that he who continueth to

The fir&s;t, which I &s;hall mention, is, a
timely retreat from the world. In every
part of life, we are in hazard of being
too deeply immer&s;ed in its cares. But,
in former periods, the impul&s;e of active
&s;pirit, the nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of our &s;ta|tion,
and the allowable endeavours to ad|vance
our fortune by fair indu&s;try, ren|dered
it difficult to ob&s;erve due modera|tion.
In old age, all the motives of
eager pur&s;uit dimini&s;h. The voice of
Nature then calls you, to leave to others
the bu&s;tle and conte&s;t of the world; and
gradually to di&s;engage your&s;elves from
a burden, which begins to exceed your
&s;trength. Having born your &s;hare of the
heat and labour of the day, let the even|ing
of life be pa&s;&s;ed in the cool and
quiet &s;hade. It is only in the &s;hade,
that the virtues of old age can flouri&s;h.
There, its duties are di&s;charged with
mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s; and there, its comforts are
enjoyed with greate&s;t &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>By the retreat of old age, however, I
do not mean, a total ce&s;&s;ation from every
<PB N="353" REF="362">
worldly employment. There is an error
in this, as well as in the oppo&s;ite ex|treme.
Per&s;ons who have been long
hara&s;&s;ed with bu&s;ine&s;s and care, &s;ome|times
imagine, that when life declines,
they cannot make their retirement from
the world too complete. But where
they expected a delicious enjoyment of
lei&s;ure and ea&s;e, they have often found
a melancholy &s;olitude. Few are able,
in any period of their days, to bear a
total ab&s;traction from the world. There
remains a vacancy, which they cannot
fill up. Incapable of being always
employed in the exerci&s;es of religion,
and often little qualified for the en|tertainments
of the under&s;tanding, they
are in hazard of becoming a burden to
them&s;elves, and to all with whom they
are connected. It is, therefore, the duty
of the aged, not &s;o much to withdraw
entirely from worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, as to con|tract
its circle; not &s;o much to break
off, as to loo&s;en, their communication
with active life. Continuing that train
<PB N="354" REF="363">
of occupation to which they have been
mo&s;t accu&s;tomed, let them pur&s;ue it with
le&s;s inten&s;ene&s;s; relaxing their efforts, as
their powers decline; retiring more and
more, from publick ob&s;ervation, to dome|&s;tick
&s;cenes, and &s;erious thoughts; till,
as the decays of life advance, the world &s;hall
of it&s;elf withdraw to a greater di&s;tance
from their view; its objects &s;hall gradu|ally
yield their place to others of more
importance; and its tumults &s;hall &s;ound
in their ears, only like a noi&s;e which is
heard from afar.</P>
<P>If it be the duty of the old, to retreat
betimes from the fatigue of worldly care,
it is &s;till more incumbent on them, to
quit the pur&s;uit of &s;uch plea&s;ures as are
un&s;uitable to their years. Chearfulne&s;s,
in old age, is graceful. It is the natural
concomitant of virtue. But the chear|fulne&s;s
of age, is widely different from
the levity of youth. Many things are
allowable in that early period, which, in
maturer years, would de&s;erve cen&s;ure;
but which, in old age, become both ridi|culous
<PB N="355" REF="364">
and criminal. By aukwardly af|fecting
to imitate the manners, and to
mingle in the vanities, of the young, as
the aged depart frorm the dignity, &s;o they
forfeit the privileges of gray hairs. But
if, by follies of this kind, they are de|graded,
they are expo&s;ed to much deeper
blame, by de&s;cending to vitious plea&s;ure,
and continuing to hover round tho&s;e
&s;inful gratifications to which they were
once addicted. Amu&s;ement and relaxa|tion
the aged require, and. may enjoy.
But let them con&s;ider well, that by every
intemperate indulgence, they accelerate
decay; in&s;tead of enlivening, they op|pre&s;s,
and precipitate, their declining &s;tate,
Ea&s;e, &s;afety, and re&s;pect, are the proper
enjoyments of age. Within the&s;e bounds
let it remain, and not vainly attempt to
break through that barrier, by which Na|ture
has &s;eparatcd die plea&s;ures of youth,
from the comforts left to the concluding
years of life.</P>
<P>A material part of the duty of die aged
con&s;i&s;ts, in &s;tudying to be u&s;eful to the
<PB N="356" REF="365">
race who are to &s;ucceed them. Here
opens to them an exten&s;ive field, in which
they may &s;o employ themselves, as con|&s;iderably
to advance the intere&s;ts of reli|gion,
and the happine&s;s of mankind. To
them it belongs, to impart to the young
the fruit of their long experience; to in|&s;truct
them in the proper conduct, and
to warn them of the various dangers, of
life; by wi&s;e coun&s;el, to temper their pre|cipitate
ardour; and, both by precept and
example, to form them to piety and virtue.</P>
<P>It is not by rigorous di&s;cipline, and
unrelaxing au&s;terity, that they can main|tain
an a&s;cendant over youthful minds.
The con&s;traint which their pre&s;ence
will impo&s;e, and the aver&s;ion which
their manners will create, if the one be
con&s;tantly awful, and the other &s;evere,
tend to fru&s;trate the eflfect of all their
wi&s;dom. They mu&s;t a&s;&s;ume the &s;pirit of
the companion, and the friend; and mix
with the authority of age, a proper de|gree
of indulgence to the manners of
the young. In&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening the re|&s;pect
<PB N="357" REF="366">
due to their years by &s;uch conde&s;cen|&s;ion,
they take the &s;ure&s;t method to in|crea&s;e
it. Old age never appears with
greater dignity, than, when tempered by
mildne&s;s, and enlivened with good hu|mour,
it acts as the guide and the pa|tron
of youth. Religion di&s;played in
&s;uch a character, &s;trikes the beholders,
as at once amiable and venerable. They
revere its power, when they &s;ee it adding
&s;o much grace to the decays of nature,
and &s;hedding &s;o plea&s;ing a lu&s;tre over
the evening of life. The young with to
tread in the &s;ame &s;teps, and to arrive
at the clo&s;e of their days with equal ho|nour.
They li&s;ten with attention to
coun&s;els, which are mingled with ten|derne&s;s,
and rendered re&s;pectable by gray
hairs. For, notwith&s;tanding all its pre|&s;umption,
youth naturally bends before
&s;uperiour knowledge and years. Aged
wi&s;dom, when joined with acknowledged
virtue, exerts an authority over the hu|man
mind, greater even than that which
ari&s;es from power and &s;tation. It can
<PB N="358" REF="367">
check the mo&s;t forward, aba&s;h the mo&s;t
profligate, and &s;trike with awe the mo&s;t
giddy and unthinking.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of their endeavours to be
u&s;eful to others, let not the aged forget
tho&s;c religious employments, which their
own &s;tate particularly requires. The fir&s;t
of the&s;e, is, reflection on their pa&s;t beha|viour,
with a view to di&s;cover the errors
which they have committed; and, as far
as remaining life allows, to amend and
repent.&mdash;Long has the world bewildered
you in its maze, and impo&s;ed upon you
by its arts. The time is now come, when
this great &s;educer &s;hould mi&s;lead you no
more. From the calm &s;tation at which
you are arrived, &s;eque&s;tered from the
crowd of the deceiving, and the deceiv|ed,
review your conduct, with the eye of
Chri&s;tians and immortal beings. After
all the tumult of life is over, what now
remains to afford you &s;olid &s;atisfaction?
Have you &s;erved God with fidelity, and
discharged your part to your fellow|creatures
with integrity and a good con|&s;cience?
<PB N="359" REF="368">
Can you look forward, without
terrour, to that day which is to di&s;&s;olve
your connection with this world, and to
bring; you into the pre&s;ence of him who
mad$ you, in order to give account of
your actions?&mdash;The retro&s;pect of life is
&s;eldom wholly unattended by unea&s;ine&s;s
and &s;hame. Though, to the good and the
bad, it presents a very different &s;cene;
yet, to all men, it recalls much guilt in|curred,
and much time mi&s;pent. It too
much re&s;embles the review, which a tra|veller
takes from &s;ome eminence, of a bar|ren
country, through which he has pa&s;|&s;ed,
where the heath and the de&s;ert form
the chief pro&s;pect; diver&s;ified only by a
few &s;cattered &s;pots of imperfect cultiva|tion.</P>
<P>Turn then your thoughts to the proper
methods of making your peace with God
through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and implore, from
Divine grace, that <HI>new heart</HI> and <HI>righ
&s; pirit,</HI> which will fit you for a better world.
Let devotion fill up many of tho&s;e hours,
which are now vacant from worldly bu|&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="360" REF="369">
and care. Let your affections dwell
among divine and immortal objects. In
&s;ilent and thoughtful meditation, walk
as on the &s;hore of that va&s;t ocean, upon
which you are &s;oon to embark. Summon
up all the con&s;iderations which &s;hould
reconcile you to your departure from life;
and which may prepare you for going
through its la&s;t &s;cene, with firmne&s;s and
decency. Often let your thank&s;givings
a&s;cend to God, for that watchful care
with which he hath hitherto conducted
you, through the long journey of life.
Often let your prayers be heard, that, in
what remains of your pilgrimage, he may
not for&s;ake you; and that, when you en|ter
into the <HI>valley of the &s;hadow of death,</HI>
he may there &s;upport you with <HI>his &s;taff,</HI>
and defend you with <HI>his rod.</HI>&mdash;Amid&s;t
&s;uch thoughts and cares, let old age find
you employed; betaking your&s;elves to a
prudent and timely retreat; di&s;engaged,
both from the oppre&s;&s;ive load of bu&s;s|ne&s;,
and from the un&s;ea&s;onable pur&s;uit
of plea&s;ure; applying your&s;elves to form
<PB N="361" REF="370">
the &s;ucceeding race, by your coun&s;els to
virtue and wi&s;dom; reviewing &s;eriou&s;ly
your pa&s;t life; by repentance and devo|tion,
preparing your&s;elves for a better;
and, with humble and manly compo&s;ure,
expecting that hour, which Nature cannot
now long delay. It remains,</P>
<P>III. To &s;ugge&s;t the con&s;olations which
belong to old age, when thus <HI>found in the
way of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t introduce them with ob&s;erving,
that nothing is more rea&s;onable in it&s;elf,
than to &s;ubmit patiently to tho&s;e infirmi|ties
of Nature, which are brought on by
the increa&s;e of years. You knew before|hand
what you had to expect, when you
numbered the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Summers and
Winters, which were pa&s;&s;ing over your
heads.. Old age did not attack you by
&s;urprize, nor was it forced upon you
again&s;t your choice. Often, and earne&s;t|ly,
did you wi&s;h to <HI>&s;ee long life and many
days.</HI> When arrived at the de&s;ired period,
have you any ju&s;t cau&s;e to complain, on
<PB N="362" REF="371">
account of enduring what the con&s;titu|tion
of our being impo&s;es on all? Did
you expect, that, for your &s;ake, Provi|dence
was to alter its e&s;tabli&s;hed order?
Throughout the whole vegetable, &s;en&s;ible,
and rational world, whatever makes pro|gre&s;s
towards maturity, as &s;oon as it has
pa&s;&s;ed that point, begins to verge towards
decay. It is as natural for old age to be
frail, as for the corn to bend under The
ripened ear, or for the autumnal leaf to
change its hue. To this law, all who
went before you, have &s;ubmitted; and
all who &s;hall come after you, mu&s;t yield.
After they have flouri&s;hed for a &s;ea&s;on,
they &s;hall &s;ink, like you, into the vale of
life, and bow under the pre&s;&s;ure of years.
During the whole progre&s;s of the hu|man
cour&s;e, the principal materials of'our
comfort or unea&s;ine&s;s, lie within our&s;elves.
Every age will prove burden&s;ome, to tho&s;e
who have no fund of happine&s;s in their
own brea&s;t. Pre&s;erve them, if you could,
from all infirmity of frame. Be&s;tow upon
them, if it were po&s;&s;ible, perpetual youth;</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="372">
&s;till they would be re&s;tle&s;s and mi&s;erable,
through the influence of ill-governed pa&s;|&s;ions.
No wonder that &s;uch per&s;ons are
peevi&s;h and querulous, when old. Unju&s;tly
they impute to their time of life, that mi|&s;ery
with which their vices and follies em|bitter
every age. Whereas, to good men,
no period of life is un&s;upportable, becau&s;e
they draw their chief happine&s;s from
&s;ources which are independent of age or
time. Wi&s;dom, piety, and virtue, grow not
old with our bodies. They &s;uffer no decay
from length of days. To them only be|longs
unalterable and unfading youth.
<HI>Tho&s;e that be planted in the hou&s;e of the
Lord, &s;hall flouri&s;h in the courts of our
God. They &s;hall &s;iill bring forth fruit in old
age; they &s;hall be fat, and flouri&s;hing.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xcii. 13, 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>You are now, it is true, pa&s;t reli&s;ing
many of tho&s;e plea&s;ures which once a|mu&s;ed
you. Your &s;en&s;ations are le&s;s quick
than formerly; your days, more lan|gui&s;hing.
But if you have quitted the
region of plea&s;ure, in return, you po&s;&s;e&s;s
that of tranquillity and repo&s;e. If you
<PB N="364" REF="373">
are &s;trangers of the vivacity of enjoyment,
you are free, at the &s;ame time, from the pain
of violent and often di&s;appointed de&s;ie.
Much fatigue, much vexation, as well as
vanity, attend that turbulence of life, in
which the younger part of mankind are
engaged. A mid&s;t tho&s;e keen pur&s;uits,
and &s;eeming plea&s;ures, for which you en|vy
them, often they feel their own mi&s;ery,
and look forward with a wi&s;hful eye to
the &s;ea&s;on of calmne&s;s and retreat. For,
on all &s;ides of human life, the balance of
happine&s;s is adju&s;ted with more equality
than at fir&s;t appears; and if old age
throws &s;ome new di&s;tre&s;&s;es into the &s;cale,
it lightens al&s;o the weight of others. Many
pa&s;&s;ions, which formerly created you much
di&s;turbance, have now &s;ub&s;ided. Many
competitions, which long filled your days
with di&s;quiet and &s;trife, are now at an
end. Many afflictions, which once rent
your hearts with violent angui&s;h, are now
&s;oftened into a tender emotion, on the
remembrance of pa&s;t woe. In the begin|nings
of life, there was room for much
<PB N="365" REF="374">
apprehen&s;ion concerning what might be|fall
in its progre&s;s. Your &s;ecurity was
never untroubled. Your hopes were di&s;|turbed
with many anxieties and fears.
Having fini&s;hed the career of labour and
danger, your anxiety ought of cour&s;e to
le&s;&s;en. About to enter into the harbour,
you can look back, as from a &s;ecure &s;ta|tion,
upon the perils you have e&s;caped,
upon the tempe&s;t by which you was to&s;|&s;ed,
and upon the multitudes who are &s;till
conflicting with the &s;torm.</P>
<P>If you have acted your part with inte|grity
and honour, you are ju&s;tly entitled
to re&s;pect, and you will generally receive
it. For rarely, or never, is old age con|temned,
unle&s;s when, by vice or folly,
it renders it&s;elf contemptible. Though
length of time may have worn off &s;uper|ficial
ornaments, yet, what old age lo&s;es
in grace, it often gains in dignity. The
veneration, as was before ob&s;erved, which
gray hairs command, puts it in the power
of the aged, to maintain a very important
place in human &s;ociety. They are &s;o far
<PB N="366" REF="375">
from being insignificant in the world,
that families long held together by their
authority, and &s;ocieties accu&s;tomed to be
guided by their counsels, have frequently
had cau&s;e to regret their lo&s;s, more than
that of the mo&s;t vigorous and young. To
&s;ucce&s;s of every kind, the head which di|rects,
is no le&s;s e&s;&s;ential, than the hand
which executes. Vain, nay often dan|gerous,
were youthful enterprise, if not
conducted by aged prudence. <HI>I &s;aid, Days
&s;hould &s;peak, and multitude of years &s;hould
teach wi&s;dom.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">job xxiii. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Therefore thou &s;balt ri&s;e
up before the hoary head, and honour the
face of the old man, and fear thy God.</HI><NOTE N="dagger" PLACE="foot">Lev. xix. 32.</NOTE>
Though, in old age, the circle of your
pleasures is more contracted than it has
formerly been; yet, within its limits, ma|ny
of tho&s;c enjoyments remain, which
are mo&s;t grateful to human nature. Tem|perate
mirth, is not extingui&s;hed by ad|vanced
years. The mild pleasures of
dome&s;tick life, &s;till chear the heart. The
entertainments of conversation, and &s;ocial
intercourse, continue unimpaired. The
<PB N="367" REF="376">
de&s;ire of knowledge, is not abated by the
frailty of the body; and the lei&s;ure of old
age, affords many opportunities for grati|fying
that de&s;ire. The sphere of your
ob&s;ervation and reflection, is so much en|larged
by long acquaintance with the
world, as to &s;upply, within it&s;elf, a wide
range of improving thought. To recall
the various revolutions which have oc|curred
&s;ince you began to act your part
in life; to compare the characters of pa&s;t
and pre&s;ent times; to trace the hand of
Providence, in all the incidents of your
own lot; to contemplate with thoughtful
eye, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive new appearances which
the world has a&s;&s;umed around you, in
government, education, opinions, cu&s;|toms,
and modes of living; the&s;e are
employments, no lefs entertaining, than
in&s;tructive to the mind.</P>
<P>While you are engaged in &s;uch em|ployments,
you are perhaps &s;urrounded
with your families, who treat you with
attention and respect; you are honoured
by your friends; your character is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed;
<PB N="368" REF="377">
you are placed beyond the reach
of clamour, <HI>and the &s;trife of tongues;</HI> and,
free from di&s;tracting cares, you can at|tend
calmly to your eternal intere&s;ts. For
&s;uch comforts as the&s;e, have you not
cau&s;e mo&s;t thankfully to acknowledge
the goodne&s;s of Heaven? Do they not af|ford
you ground, to pa&s;s the remainder of
your days in re&s;ignation and peace; di&s;|po&s;ing
your&s;elves to ri&s;e in due time, like
&s;atisfied gue&s;ts, from the banquet that
has been &s;et before you; and to prai&s;e
and ble&s;s, when you depart, the great
Ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t? <HI>To a man that is good
in his &s;ight,</HI> whether he be young or old,
<HI>God giveth wi&s;dom, and knowledge, and joy.</HI>
For every &s;ea&s;on of life, the benignity of
his providence hath prepared its own &s;atis|factions,
while his wi&s;dom hath appointed
its peculiar trials. No age is doomed to
total infelicity; provided that we attempt
not to do violence to Nature, by &s;eeking to
extort from one age, the plea&s;ures of ano|ther;
and to gather, in the Winter of life,
<PB N="369" REF="378">
tho&s;e flowers which were de&s;tined to blo&s;|&s;om
only in its Summer or its Spring.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps it will be &s;aid, that I
have con&s;idered old age, only its fir&s;t
&s;tages, and in its mo&s;t favourable point of
light; before the faculties are as yet much
impaired, and when di&s;ea&s;e or affliction
has laid no additional load on the bur|den
of years. Let us then view it, with
all its aggravations of di&s;tre&s;s. Let us
&s;uppo&s;e it arrived at its utmo&s;t verge,
worn out with infirmities, and bowed
down by &s;ickne&s;s and &s;orrow. Still there
remains this con&s;olation, that it is not
long <HI>ere the weary &s;hall be at re&s;t.</HI> Having
pa&s;&s;ed through &s;o many of the toils of life,
you may now, &s;urely, when your pilgri|mage
touches on its clo&s;e, bear, without
extreme impatience, the hard&s;hips of its
concluding &s;tage. From the ine&s;timable
promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel, and from the gra|cious
pre&s;ence of God, the afflictions of
old age cannot &s;eclude you. Though <HI>your

<PB N="370" REF="379">
fail,</HI> there is One, who can be <HI>the &s;trength

<P>There is undoubtedly a period, when
there ought to be a &s;atiety of life, as there
is of all other things; and when death
&s;hould be viewed, as your merciful di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion
from a long warfare. To come to
the grave in a full age, like as a &s;hock of
corn cometh in, in its &s;ea&s;on,<NOTE N="Dagger" PLACE="foot">Job v. 26</NOTE> is the na|tural
termination of the human cour&s;e.
Amid&s;t multiplying infirmities, to pro|long
life beyond its u&s;ual bounds, and to
draw out your exi&s;tence here to the la&s;t
and foule&s;t dregs, ought not to be the
wi&s;h of any wi&s;e man. Is it de&s;irable, to
continue lingering on the borders of the
grave, after every tie which connects you
with life is broken; and to be left a &s;oli|tary

individual, in the mid&s;t of a new ge|neration,

<P>Could death indeed be con&s;idered in no
other view, than as the clo&s;e of life, it
would afford only a melancholy retreat.
The total extinction of being, is a thought
which human nature, in its mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed
circum&s;tances, cannot bear without
dejection. But, ble&s;&s;ed be God! far other
pro&s;pects revive the &s;pirits of the aged,
who have &s;pent their life in piety and vir|tue.
To them, death is not the extinction,
<PB N="372" REF="381">
but the renovation of the living principle;
its removal from <HI>the earthly hou&s;e of this
tabernacle, to the hou&s;e not made with hands,
eternal in the heavens. Having &s;ought the
good &s;ight; having fini&s;hed their cour&s;e, and
kept the faith; there is laid up for them&punc; the
crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The Saviour of the
world, hath not only <HI>brought immortality
to light,</HI> but placed it within the reach
of their hope and tru&s;t. By making
atonement for their guilt, he hath pre|pared
their way <HI>within the veil;</HI> and
&s;ecured to them, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>an in|heritance,
incorruptible and unde$iled, re&s;erv|ed
in the heavens.</HI>&mdash;Such are the hopes
and pro&s;pects, which chear the &s;orrows
of old age, and &s;urmount the fear of
death. Faith and piety are the only ade|quate
&s;upports of human nature, in all
its great emergencies. After they have
guided us through the various trials of
life, they uphold us, at la&s;t amid&s;t the
ruins of this falling frame; and when
<HI>the &s;ilver cord is ju&s;t ready to be loo&s;ed,
<PB N="373" REF="382">
and the golden bowl to be broken; when
the pitcher is broken at the fountain, and
the wheel broken at the ci&s;tern;</HI> they en|able

&s;ting? O Grave! where is thy victory?</HI></P>

<P>THIS book of Gene&s;is di&s;plays a more
&s;ingular and intere&s;ting &s;cene,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIII.</NOTE> than
was ever pre&s;ented to the world, by any
other hi&s;torical record. It carries us back
to the beginning of time; and exhibits
mankind, in their infant and ri&s;ing &s;tate.
<PB N="375" REF="384">
It &s;hows us human manners in their pri|mitive
&s;implicity, before the arts of refine|ment
had poli&s;hed the behaviour, or di&s;|gui&s;ed
the characters of men; when they
gave vent to their pa&s;&s;ions without di&s;|&s;imulation,
and &s;poke their &s;entiments
without re&s;erve. Few great &s;ocieties were,
as yet, formed on the earth. Men lived in
&s;cattered tribes. The tran&s;actions of fa|milies,
made the chief materials of hi&s;to|ry;
and they are related in this book,
with that beautiful &s;implicity, which, in
the highe&s;t degree, both delights the ima|gination,
and affects the heart.</P>
<P>Of all the patriarchal hi&s;tories, that of
Jo&s;eph and his brethren is the mo&s;t re|markable,
for the characters of the actors,
the in&s;tructive nature of the events, and
the &s;urprizing revolutions of worldly for|tune.
As far as relates to the Text, and
is nece&s;&s;ary for explaining it, the &s;tory is
to the following purpo&s;e.&mdash;Jo&s;eph, the
younge&s;t, except one, of the &s;ons of Jacob,
was di&s;tingui&s;hed by his father with &s;uch
marks of peculiar affection, as excited the
<PB N="376" REF="385">
envy of his brethren. Having related to
them, in the openne&s;s of his heart, cer|tain
dreams which portended his future
advancement above them, their jealou&s;y
ro&s;e to &s;uch a height, that they unnatu|rally
con&s;pired his de&s;truction. Seizing
the opportunity of his being at a di&s;tance
from home, they fir&s;t threw him into a
pit, and afterwards &s;old him for a &s;lave;
impo&s;ing on their father, by a fal&s;e rela|tion
of his death. When they had thus
gratified their re&s;entment, they lo&s;t all
remembrance of their crime. The fami|ly
of Jacob was rich and powerful; and
&s;everal years pa&s;&s;ed away, during which
they lived in pro&s;perity; without being
touched, as far as appears, with the lea&s;t
remor&s;e for the cruel deed which they
had committed.</P>
<P>Mean-while, Jo&s;eph was &s;afely conduct|ed,
by the hand of Providence, through a
variety of dangers, untill, from the lowe&s;t
condition, he ro&s;e at laft to be chief fa|vourite
of the King of Egypt, the mo&s;t
powerful monarch at that time in the
<PB N="377" REF="386">
world. While he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this high dig|nity,
a general famine di&s;tre&s;&s;ed all the
neighbouring countries. In Egypt alone,
by means of his fore&s;ight, and prudent ad|mini&s;tration,
plenty &s;till reigned. Com|pelled
to have recour&s;e to that kingdom
for &s;upply of food, the brethren of Jo&s;esph,
upon this occa&s;ion, appeared in his pre|&s;ence,
and made their humble application
to him, for liberty to purcha&s;e corn; lit|tle
&s;u&s;pecting that the Governour of the
land, before whom <HI>they bowed down their
faces to the earth,</HI> was him, whom, long
ago, they had &s;old as a &s;lave to the I&s;h|maelites.
But Jo&s;eph no &s;ooner &s;aw, than
he knew his brethren; and, on this un|expected
meeting, his heart melted with|in
him. Fraternal tenderne&s;s aro&s;e, in all
its warmth; and totally e&s;&s;aced, from his
generous brea&s;t, the impre&s;&s;ion of their
ancient cruelty. Though, from that mo|ment,
he began to prepare for them a &s;ur|prize
of joy; yet, he &s;o far con&s;trained him|&s;elf,
as to a&s;&s;ume an appearance of great
&s;everity. By this he intended, both to ob|lige
<PB N="378" REF="387">
them to bring into Egypt his younge&s;t
and mo&s;t beloved brother, who&s;e pre&s;ence
he in&s;tantly required; and also, to awaken
within them, a due &s;en&s;e of the crime
which they had formerly perpetrated.
Accordingly, his behaviour produced the
de&s;igned effect. For, while they were in
this &s;ituation, &s;trangers in a foreign land,
where they had fallen, as they conceived,
into extreme di&s;tre&s;s; thrown into pri&s;on
by the Governour, and treated with ri|gour
for which they could a&s;&s;ign no
cau&s;e; the reflection mentioned in the
Text aro&s;e in their minds. Con&s;cience
brought to remembrance, their former
&s;ins. It recalled, in particular, their long
forgotten cruelty to Jo&s;eph; and, with|out
$e&s;itation, they interpreted their pre|&s;ent
di&s;tre&s;s, to be a judgment, for this
crime, inflicted by Heaven. <HI>They &s;aid, one
to another, We are verily guilty concerning
our brother, in that we &s;aw the angui&s;h of
his &s;oul, when he be&s;ought us; and we would
not hear: Therefore is this di&s;tre&s;s come upon
us.&mdash;Behold al&s;o his blood is required.</HI>
<PB N="379" REF="388">
From this in&s;tructive pa&s;&s;age of hi&s;to|ry,
the following ob&s;ervations naturally
ari&s;e. I. That a &s;en&s;e of right and wrong
in conduct, or of moral good and evil,
belongs to human nature. II. That it
produces an apprehen&s;ion of merited pu|ni&s;hment,
when we have committed evil.</P>
<P>III. That although this inward &s;enti|ment
be &s;tifhed during the &s;ea&s;on of
pro&s;perity, yet, in adver&s;ity, it will re|vive.
And, IV. That when it revives,
it determines us to con&s;ider every di&s;tre&s;s
which we &s;uffer, from what cau&s;e &s;oever
it has ari&s;en, as an actual infliction of
puni&s;hment by Heaven. The con&s;ide|ration
of the&s;e particulars, will lead us
to a verv &s;erious view of the nature of
man, and of the government of God.</P>
<P>I. There belongs to human nature, a
&s;en&s;e of moral good and evil, or a fa|culty
which di&s;tingui&s;hes right from
wrong, in action and conduct. <HI>They &s;aid,
one to another, We are verily guilty.</HI>&mdash;In
an age, when the law was not yet given,
when no external revelation of the Di|vine
<PB N="380" REF="389">
will &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, except what had been
handed down among the Patriarchs, from
one generation to another; the brethren
of Jo&s;eph rea&s;oned concerning their con|duct,
upon the &s;ame moral principles,
and were affected by the &s;ame feelings,
of which we are con&s;cious at this day.
Such &s;entiments are coeval with human
nature; for they are the remains of a
law, which was originally <HI>written in our
heart.</HI> In the darke&s;t regions of the
earth, and among the rude&s;t tribes of
men, a di&s;tinction has ever been made,
between ju&s;t and unju&s;t, between a duty
and a crime. Throughout all the inter|cour&s;e
of human beings, the&s;e di&s;tinctions
are &s;uppo&s;ed. They are the foundation
of the mutual tru&s;t, which the tran&s;ac|tions
of life require; nay, the very enter|tainments
of &s;ociety con&s;tantly appeal to
them. The Hi&s;torian, who &s;tudies to
magnify his hero, by repre&s;enting him as
ju&s;t and generous; the Poet, who &s;eeks
to intere&s;t the world in his fictions, by
engaging the heart in behalf of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="381" REF="390">
virtue, are &s;ufficient to confute the Scep|tick,
who denies any natural perception
of a di&s;tinction in actions.</P>
<P>But though a &s;en&s;e of moral good and
evil be deeply impre&s;&s;ed on the heart of
man, yet it is not of &s;ufficient power to
regulate his life. In his pre&s;ent corrupt|ed
&s;tate, it is both too general to afford
him full direction in conduct, and too
feeble to with&s;tand the oppo&s;ition of con|trary
principles in his nature. It is often
perverted, by ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition:
It is too ea&s;ily overcome, by pa&s;&s;ion and
de&s;ire. Hence, the importance of that
Divine revelation, which communicates
both light and &s;trength; which, by the
in&s;tructive di&s;coveries it makes, and by
the powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance it &s;upplies, rai&s;es
man to a &s;tation, infinitely &s;uperiour to
that which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es under the mere
light of Nature.</P>
<P>It is of consequence, however, to re|mark,
that this revelation nece&s;&s;arily &s;up|po&s;es,
an antecedent &s;en&s;e of right and
wrong to take place in the human mind,
<PB N="382" REF="391">
It addre&s;&s;es it&s;elf to men, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
&s;uch a faculty; and, when it commands
them, in general terms, to pur&s;ue <HI>what|&s;oever
things are true, what&s;oever things
are hone&s;t, what&s;oever things are ju&s;t, pure,
lovely, or of good report, if there be any vir|tue,
and if there be any prai&s;e,</HI> it plainly
appeals to the native dictates of their
heart. Nay, unle&s;s men were endowed
by Nature, with &s;ome &s;en&s;e of duty, or
of moral obligation, they could reap no
benefit from revelation; they would re|main
incapable of all religion whatever.
For, in vain were a &s;y&s;tem of duty pre|&s;cribed
to them by the word of God;
allegiance were in vain required towards
their Creator, or love and gratitude en|joined
towards their Redeemer; if, pre|viou&s;ly,
there was no principle in their
nature, which made them feel the obliga|tions
of duty, of allegiance, and of gra|titude.
They could have no ideas cor|re&s;ponding
to &s;uch terms; nor any con|viction,
that, independently of fear or in|tere&s;t,
they were bound to regard, either
<PB N="383" REF="392">
him who made, or him who redeemed
them.&ndash;This, therefore, is to be held as a
principal fundamental to all religion, That
there is in human nature, an approving
or condemning &s;en&s;e of conduct; by
means of which, <HI>they who have not the
law, are a law unto them&s;elves</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 14.</NOTE>. They,
who from a mi&s;taken zeal for the honour
of Divine revelation, either deny the ex|i&s;tence,
or vilify the authority, of natural
religion, are not aware, that, by di&s;allow|ing
the &s;en&s;e of obligation, they under|mine
the foundation, on which revela|tion
builds its power of commanding
the heart.</P>
<P>The Text leads us to ob&s;erve, that one
of the ca&s;es in which the natural &s;en&s;e of
good and evil operates mo&s;t forcibly, is,
when men have been guilty of inju&s;tice
or inhumanity. <HI>We &s;aw the angui&s;h of
our brother's &s;oul when he be&s;ought us, and
we would not hear.</HI> An inward principle
prompts us to do good to others; but
with much greater authority, it checks
<PB N="384" REF="393">
and condemns us, when we have done
them injuries. This part of the human
constitution de&s;erves particular remark,
as a &s;ignal proof of the wi&s;dom of its Au|thor,
and of the gracious provi&s;ion which
he has made for the welfare of mankind.
We are all committed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
to the care and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one another.
But our mutual influence reaches much
farther, with respect to the evils, than
with re&s;pect to the enjoyments, of tho&s;e
around us. To advance their pro&s;perity,
is often beyond our ability; but to in|flict
injuries, is almo&s;t always within our
power: And, at the &s;ame time, &s;elf-inte|re&s;t
very frequently tempts us to commit
them. With the utmo&s;t propriety, there|fore,
we are &s;o framed, that the influence
of the moral principle &s;hould be mo&s;t
authoritative, in ca&s;es where its aid is mo&s;t
needed; that to promote the happine&s;s
of others, &s;hould appear to us as prai&s;e|worthy,
indeed, and generous; but that,
to ab&s;tain from injuring them, &s;hould be
felt as matter of the &s;tricte&s;t duty.&mdash;
<PB N="385" REF="394">
Amid&s;t the di&s;tre&s;s which the Patriarchs
&s;uffered in Egypt, had only this &s;ugge&s;|tion
occurred, &startq;We &s;aw our brother
beginning to pro&s;per, and we contri|buted
not to his advancement,&endq; their
minds would have been more ea&s;ily quiet|ed.
But, when their reflection was, <HI>We
&s;aw his angui&s;h when he be&s;ought us, and
we would not hear,</HI> then, compunction
turned upon them its &s;harpe&s;t edge. I
proceed to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>II. THAT our natural &s;en&s;e of right
and wrong, produces an apprehension of
merited puni&s;hment, when we have com|mitted
a crime. When it is employed in
&s;urveying the behaviour of others, it di&s;|tingui&s;hes
&s;ome actions, as laudable and
excellent; and disapproves of others, as
evil and ba&s;e. But when it is directed
upon our own conduct, it a&s;&s;umes a
higher office, and exerci&s;es the authority
of a judge. It is then properly termed,
Con&s;cience; and the &s;entiments which it
awakens, upon the perpetration of a crime,
<PB N="386" REF="395">
are &s;tiled, Remor&s;e. <HI>Therefore,</HI> &s;aid the
brethren of Jo&s;eph, <HI>is this di&s;tre&s;s come
upon us; behold al&s;o, his blood is re|quired.</HI>
They acknowledged, not only
that they had committed, a wrong, but a
wrong for which they were ju&s;tly doom|ed
to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>Did not con&s;cience &s;ugge&s;t this natural
relation between guilt and puni&s;hment,
the mere principle of approbation, or di&s;|approbation,
with re&s;pect to moral con|duct,
would prove of &s;mall efficacy. For
di&s;approbation attends,, in, &s;ome degree,
every conviction of impropriety or folly.
When one has acted un&s;uitably to his
intere&s;t, or has tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the rules
of prudence or decorum, he reflects upon
his conduct with pain, and acknowledges
that he de&s;erves blame. But the diffe|rence
between the &s;en&s;e of mi&s;conduct,
and the &s;en&s;e of guilt, con&s;i&s;ts in this,
that the latter penetrates much deeper
into the heart. It makes the criminal
feel, that he is not only blameablc, but
ju&s;tly puni&s;hable, for the part which he
<PB N="387" REF="396">
has actcd. With reference to this office
of con&s;cience, the in&s;pired writers fre|quently
&s;peak of it in terms borrowed
from the awful &s;olemnities of judicial
procedure; as, <HI>bearing witne&s;s for or again&s;t
us; accu&s;ing or excu&s;ing judging and con|demning.</HI>
It will be found, that in the
the languages of mo&s;t nations, terms of
the &s;ame import are applied to the opera|tions
of con&s;cience; expre&s;&s;ing the &s;en&s;e,
which all mankind have, of its pa&s;&s;ing
&s;entence upon them, and pronouncing
rewards or puni&s;hments to be due to
their actions.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of puni&s;hment merited, you
are further to ob&s;erve, can never be &s;e|parated
from the dread, that at &s;ome time,
and in &s;ome way or other, puni&s;hment
&s;hall be actually inflicted. This dread is
not confined to the vengeance of man.
For, let the &s;inner's evil deeds be ever &s;o
thoroughly concealed from the knowledge
of the world, his inward alarms are not
quieted upon that account. Now, puni&s;h|ment
is the &s;anction of a law. Every law
<PB N="388" REF="397">
&s;uppo&s;es a rightful &s;uperiour: And there|fore,
when con&s;cience threatens puni&s;h|ment
to &s;ecret crimes, it manife&s;tly recog|nizes
a &s;upreme Governour, from whom
nothing is hidden. The belief of our be|ing
accountable to him, is what the mo&s;t
hardened wickedne&s;s has never been able
to eradicate. It is a belief which, ari&s;es,
not merely from rea&s;oning, but from the
powerful impre&s;&s;ion of Nature. Con|&s;cience
is felt to act as the delegate of an
invi&s;ible Ruler; both anticipating his
&s;entence, and foreboding its execution.</P>
<P>Hence ari&s;e the terrours, which &s;o of|ten
haunt guilt, and ri&s;e in proportion to
its atrocity. In the hi&s;tory of all nati|ons,
the Tyrant and the Oppre&s;&s;or, the
bloody and the flagitious, have been ever
pointed out as fearful, unquiet, and re&s;t|le&s;s;
&s;ubject to alarms and apprehen&s;ions
of an unaccountable kind. And &s;urely,
to live under &s;uch di&s;quietude, from the
dread of merited puni&s;hment, is already
to undergo one of the mo&s;t &s;evere puni&s;h|ments
which human nature can &s;uffer.
<PB N="389" REF="398">
When the world threatens us with any
of its evils, we know the extent, and di&s;|cern
the limits of the danger. We &s;ee the
quarter, on which we are expo&s;ed to its
attack. We mea&s;ure our own &s;trength,
with that of our adver&s;ary; and can take
precautions, either for making re&s;i&s;tance,
or for contriving e&s;cape. But when an
awakened con&s;cience places before the
&s;inner, the ju&s;t vengeance of the Al|mighty,
the pro&s;pect is confounding, be|cau&s;e
the danger is boundle&s;s. It is a
dark unknown which threatens him. The
arm that is &s;tretched over him, he can
neither &s;ee nor re&s;i&s;t. On every &s;ide, he
dreads it; and on every object which
&s;urrounds him, he looks with terrour, be|cau&s;e
he is con&s;cious it can be employed
again&s;t him as an in&s;trument of wrath.
No wonder that the lone&s;ome &s;olitude,
or the midnight hour, &s;hould &s;trike him
with horrour. His troubled mind be|holds
forms, which other men &s;ee not;
and hears voices, which found only in
the car of guilt. A hand appears to come
<PB N="390" REF="399">
forth, and to write upon the wall over
again&s;t him; as it did of old, in the &s;ight
of an impious monarch. He &s;hall find
no ea&s;e nor re&s;t. <HI>For the Lord &s;hall give
him a trembling heart, and failing of eyes,
and &s;orrow of mind: And his life &s;hall hang
in doubt before him; and he &s;hall fear day
and night, and have none a&s;&s;urance of his life.
In the morning he &s;hall &s;ay, Would to God it
were even; and at even he &s;hall &s;ay, Would
to God it were morning, for the fear of his
heart wherewith he &s;hall fear, and for
the &s;ight which his eyes &s;hall &s;ee.</HI> His
life &s;hall be grievous unto him<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxviii 65. 66, 67 Ifa. xv. 4.</NOTE>.&mdash;Adver|&s;ity!
how blunt are all the arrows of
thy quiver, in compari&s;on with tho&s;e of
guilt!&mdash;But if &s;uch be the power of
con&s;cience, whence, it may be a&s;ked,
comes it to pa&s;s, that its influence is not
more general, either in re&s;training men
from the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;in, or in lead|ing
them to a timely repentance? This
brings me to ob&s;erve,
<PB N="391" REF="400">
III. THAT, during a cour&s;e of pro&s;pe|rity,
the operations of con&s;cience are of|ten
&s;u&s;pended; and that adver&s;ity is the
&s;ea&s;on which re&s;tores them to their proper
force. At the time when crimes are com|mitted,
the mind is too much, heated by pa&s;&s;ion,
and engro&s;&s;ed by the object of its pur&s;uit, to
be capable of proper reflec|tion.
After this tumult of &s;pirits has
&s;ub&s;ided, if a train of new pa&s;&s;ions be at
hand to employ its activity, or a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
of plea&s;urable objects occur to en|gage
its attention, it may for a while re|main,
though not entirely free from in|ward
mi&s;givings, yet uncon&s;cious of the
degree of its guilt. Di&s;&s;ipated among the
amu&s;ements of life, the &s;inner e&s;capes, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, from his own view. If he
reflects upon him&s;elf at all, the continu|ance
of pro&s;perity &s;eems to him a &s;trong
ju&s;tification of his conduct. For it will
be found, that in the hearts of all men,
there is a natural propen&s;ity, to judge of
the favour of the Supreme Being, from
the cour&s;e of external events. When they
<PB N="392" REF="401">
are born wi&s;h a &s;mooth gale along the
&s;tream of life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIII.</NOTE> and behold every thing
proceeding according to their with, hard|ly
can they be brought to believe, that
Providence is their enemy. Ba&s;king in
the &s;un-&s;hine of pro&s;perity, they &s;uppose
them&s;elves to enjoy the &s;mile of indul|gent
Heaven; and fondly conclude, that
they are on terms of friend&s;hip, with all
above, and with all below. Ea&s;y they
find it, then, to &s;pread over the gro&s;&s;e&s;t
crimes, a covering, thin, indeed, and
&s;light, yet &s;ufficient to conceal them from
a &s;uperficial view.</P>
<P>Of this we have a very remarkable in|&s;tance,
in tho&s;e brethren of Jo&s;eph, who&s;e
hi&s;tory we now con&s;ider. Not only the
&s;ilence of the in&s;pired writer, gives us
ground to conclude, that their remor&s;e
was &s;tifled until the pre&s;ent period; but,
at a former one, when, in the time of
their pro&s;perity, they were contriving the
de&s;truction of Jo&s;eph, we find Judah &s;ay|ing
to his brethren, <HI>What profit is it, if we
&s;lay our brother, and conceal his blood?
<PB N="393" REF="402">
Let us &s;ell him to the I&s;hmalites; and let
not our hand be upon him; for he is our bro|ther
and our fle&s;h: And his brethren were
content</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxvii. 26, 27.</NOTE>. Here you behold them ju&s;ti|fying
their crime, by a &s;ort of pretended
humanity; and making light of &s;elling
their brother for a &s;lave, becau&s;e they did
not take away his life. How &s;trangely
are the opinions of men altered, by a
change in their condition! How different
is this &s;entiment of the Patriarchs, from
that which they afterwards entertained of
the &s;ame action, when, as you &s;ee in the
Text, the remembrance of it wrung their
hearts with angui&s;h!</P>
<P>But men, in truth, differ as much from
them&s;elves, in prosperity, and in adver&s;ity,
as if they were different creatures. In pro|&s;perity,
every thing tends to flatter and
deceive. In adver&s;ity, the illu&s;ions of life
vani&s;h. Its avocations, and its plea&s;ures,
no longer afford the &s;inner that &s;helter
he was wont to find from con&s;cience.
Formerly, he made a part of the crowd.
He now $eels him&s;elf a &s;olitary individual,
<PB N="394" REF="403">
left alone with God, and with his own mind.
His &s;pirits are not &s;upported, as
before, by fallacious views of the favour
of Heaven. The <HI>candle of the Lord</HI> &s;hine,
not on his head; his pride is humbled;
and his affections are &s;oftened, for receiv|ing
every &s;erious impre&s;&s;ion. In this &s;itu|ation,
a man's <HI>iniquity is &s;ure to find him
out.</HI> Whatever has been notoriou&s;ly cri|minal
in his former conduct, ri&s;es as a
&s;pectre, and places it&s;elf before him. The
increa&s;ed &s;en&s;ibility of his mind, renders
him alive to feelings which lately were
faint; and wounds which had been ill
healed, bleed afre&s;h. When <HI>men take the
timbrel and the harp, and rejoice at the $ound
of the organ, they &s;ay, What is the Almighty
that we should &s;erve him?</HI> But when <HI>they
are holden in the cords of affliction, then he
&s;heweth them their work, and their tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion,
that they have exceeded. He open|eth
al&s;o their ears to di&s;cipline; and com|mandeth,
that they return from iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>Hence, we may perceive the great u&s;e|fulne&s;s,
and propriety, of that interchange
<PB N="395" REF="404">
of conditions, which takes place in hu|man
life. By prosperity, God gives.
&s;cope to our pa&s;&s;ions, and makes trial of
our di&s;positions. By adver&s;ity, he revives
the &s;erious principle within. Neither the
one, nor the other, could he born entire
and unmixed. Man, always pro&s;perous,
would, be giddy and in&s;olent; always af|flicted,
would be &s;ullen and de&s;pondent.
Hopes and fears, joy and &s;orrow, are,
therefore, So blended in his life, as both
to give room for worldly pur&s;uits, and
to recall, from time to time, the admo|nitions
of con&s;cience. Of the proportion
in which they &s;hould be mixed for this
purpo&s;e, we are very incompetent judges.
From our ignorance of the degree of di&s;|cipline,
which the &s;piritual &s;tate of others
requires, we often tax Providence un|ju&s;tly,
for its &s;everity towards them:
And, from the vanity and ra&s;hnc&s;s of
our wi&s;hes, we complain, without rea|s;on,
of its rigour to our&s;elves. While
we con&s;ult nothing but our ea&s;e, God
attends to our Spiritual improvement.
<PB N="396" REF="405">
When we &s;eek what is plea&s;ing, he &s;ends
what is u&s;eful. When, by drinking too
deep of worldly pro&s;perity, we draw in a
&s;ecret poi&s;on, he mercifully infu&s;es a me|dicine,
when he troubles and embitters
the waters. It remains now to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>IV. That when conference is tho|roughly
awakened, it determines the fin|ner,
to con&s;ider every calamity which he
&s;uffers, as a po&s;itive infliction of puni&s;hi|ment
by Heaven. As it had before
alarmed him with threatenings of Di|vine
di&s;plea&s;ure, it tells him, when he
falls under di&s;tre&s;s, that the threatened
day of account is come. Afflictions, on
&s;ome occa&s;ions, ri&s;e directly out of our
&s;ins. Thus, di&s;ea&s;es are brought on by
intemperance; poverty &s;prings from idle|ne&s;s;
and di&s;grace, from pre&s;umption.
In &s;uch ca&s;es, the puni&s;hment is fo clo&s;e|ly
connected with the crime, that it is
impo&s;&s;ible to avoid di&s;cerning the rela|tion
which the one bears to the other.
But the appointment of Providence,
<PB N="397" REF="406">
which we now con&s;ider, reaches farther
than this. God has framed us &s;o, that
di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which have no perceivable
connection with our former crimes, are,
neverthele&s;s, interpreted by con&s;cience, to
be inflicted, on their account. They
force them&s;elves upon our apprehen&s;ion,
under this view. They are made to car|ry,
not only that degree of pain which
properly belongs to them&s;elves, but that
additional torment al&s;o, which ari&s;es
from, the belief of their being the ven|geance
of the Almighty.</P>
<P>Let a man fall unexpectedly into &s;ome
deep calamity. Let that calamity be
brought upon him, either by means
which the world calls fortuitous; or by a
train of incidents, in which his own
mi&s;conduct, or guilt, has apparently had
no part; yet one of the fir&s;t que&s;tions,
which, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, he puts to
him&s;elf, is, &startq;What have I done to de&s;erve
this? His reflection is, almo&s;t in&s;tinc|tively,
drawn back upon his former life;
and if, in the cour&s;e of that retro&s;pect,
<PB N="398" REF="407">
any &s;lagrant guilty deed occur to &s;mite
his con&s;cience, on this he cannot avoid
re&s;ting with anxiety and terrour, and
connecting it in his imagination, with
what he now &s;uffers. He &s;ees, or thinks
that he &s;ees, a Divine arm lifted up; and
what, in other circum&s;tances, he would
have called a rever&s;e of fortune, he now
views as a judgment of Heaven.</P>
<P>When the brethren of Jo&s;eph, confined
in the Egyptian pri&s;on, were bewailing
the di&s;tre&s;s into which they had fallen,
there was no circum&s;tance which point|ed
out any relation between their pre&s;ent
misfortune, and their former cruelty to
their brother. A long cour&s;e of years had
intervened, during which they flouri&s;h|ed
in wealth and ea&s;e. They were now
far from the &s;cene of their crime; in $
foreign land, where they believed them|&s;elves
utterly unknown, and where they
had done nothing to offend. But con|&s;cience
formed a connection between
events, which, to the ordinary apprehen|&s;ion
of men, had none. It made them
<PB N="399" REF="408">
recollect, that they, who once had been
deaf to the &s;upplications of a brother,
were now left friendle&s;s and forlorn, im|ploring
pity in vain from an unrelenting
Governour; and that they who had fir&s;t
con&s;pired to kill their brother, and after|wards
&s;old him for a &s;lave, were them|&s;elves
deprived of liberty, and threatened
with an ignominious death. How unde|&s;ervedly
&s;oever the&s;e evils befell them on
the part of men, they confe&s;&s;ed them to
be ju&s;t on the part of Providence. They
concluded the hour of retribution to be
arrived; and, in the per&s;on of the Go|vernour
of Egypt, they beheld the Ruler
of the world calling them to account for
guilt. <HI>Therefore is this di&s;tre&s;s come upon
us. Behold al&s;o, his blood is required.</HI></P>
<P>Similar &s;entiments, on like occa&s;ions,
will be found not uncommon among
mankind. Pious men, there is no doubt,
are at all times di&s;po&s;ed to look up to
God, and to acknowledge his hand in
every event of life. But what I now ob|&s;erve,
is, that where no habitual acknow|ledgment
<PB N="400" REF="409">
of God takes place; nay, where
a daring contempt of his authority ha$
prevailed, con&s;cience, neverthele&s;s, con|&s;trains
men, in the day of their di&s;tre&s;s,
to recognize God, under the mo&s;t awful
of all characters, The avenger of pa&s;$
guilt.</P>
<P>Herein the wi&s;dom of God appears in
&s;uch a light, as ju&s;tly to claim our highe&s;t
admiration. The ordinary cour&s;e of his
Providence, is carried on by human means.
He has &s;ettled a train of events, which
proceed in a regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cau&s;es
and effects, without his appearing to in|terpo&s;e,
or to act. But the&s;e, on proper
occasions, are made to affect the human
mind, in the &s;ame manner as if he were
beheld de&s;cending from his throne, to
puni&s;h the &s;inner with his own hand.
Were God to &s;u&s;pend the laws of Nature,
on occa&s;ion of every great crime that was
committed on earth, and to govern the
world by frequent interpo&s;itions of a mi|raculous
kind, the whole order of human
affairs would be unhinged; no plans of
<PB N="401" REF="410">
action could be formed; and no &s;cope
would be given for the probation and
trial of men. On the other hand, were
the operation of &s;econd cau&s;es allowed
to conceal a Divine hand totally from
view, all &s;ense of &s;uperiour government
would be lo&s;t; the world would &s;eem to
be void of God; the &s;inner would per|ceive
nothing but chance and fortune, in
the di&s;tre&s;&s;es which he &s;uffered. Whereas,
by its being &s;o ordered, that &s;everal in|cidents
of life, &s;hall carry the &s;ame force,
and &s;trike the mind with the &s;ame im|pre&s;&s;ion,
as if they were &s;upernatural in|terpo&s;itions,
the fear of God is kept alive
among men, and the order of human af|fairs
is, at the &s;ame time, pre&s;erved un|broken.
The &s;inner &s;ees his di&s;tre&s;s to
be the immediate effect of human vio|lence
or oppre&s;&s;ion; and is obliged, at
the &s;ame moment, to con&s;ider it as a Di|vine
judgment. His con&s;cience gives to
an ordinary misfortune, all the edge and
the &s;ting, of a vi&s;itation from Heaven.
<PB N="402" REF="411">
FROM the train of thought which the
Text has &s;ugge&s;ted, &s;everal inferences na|turally
follow. But I &s;hall confine my&s;elf
to two, which claim your particular at|tention.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, the clear evidence which
the preceeding ob&s;ervations a$ford, of a
Divine government, now exerci&s;ed over
mankind. This mo&s;t important and aw|ful
of all truths, cannot be too often pre|&s;ented
to our view, or too &s;trongly im|pre&s;&s;ed
on our mind. To the imperfect
conviction of it, which obtains in the
world, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed, in a great mea|&s;ure,
the prevalence of &s;in. Did men
firmly believe, that the Almighty Being,
who formed them, is carrying on a &s;y|&s;tem
of admini&s;tration which will not
leave guilt unpuni&s;hed, it is impo&s;&s;ible
that they could remain &s;o inattentive, as
we often behold them, to their moral
conduct. But the bulk of mankind are
giddy and thoughtle&s;s. Struck by the
&s;uperficial appearances of plea&s;ure, which
accompany licentiou&s;ne&s;s, they enquire
<PB N="403" REF="412">
no farther; and deliver them&s;elves up to
their &s;en&s;es, and their pa&s;&s;ions. Where|as,
were they to reflect, but for a mo|ment,
upon that view which has nowbeen
given of human nature, they might
&s;oon be &s;atisfied, that the moral govern|ment
of God is no matter of doubtful
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. It is a fact, no le&s;s obvious
and incontestable, than the government
exerci&s;ed by tho&s;e earthly rulers, whom
we behold with the en&s;igns of their of|fice,
before our eyes.</P>
<P>To govern, is to require a certain
cour&s;e of action, or, to pre&s;cribe a law;
and to enforce that law, by a &s;uitable
di&s;tribution of rewards and puni&s;hments.
Now, God has not only inve&s;ted con|&s;cience,
as we have &s;een, with authority
to promulgate, but endowed it al&s;o with
power to enforce, his law. By placing
inward approbation and peace on the &s;ide
of virtue, he gave it the &s;anction of re|ward.
But this was not enough. Pain
is a more powerful principle, than p$ea|&s;ure.
To e&s;cape mi&s;ery, is a &s;tronger mo|tive
<PB N="404" REF="413">
for action, than to obtain good. God,
therefore, &s;o framed human nature, that
the painful &s;en&s;e of ill-de&s;ert &s;hould at|tend
the commi&s;&s;ion of crimes; that this
&s;en&s;e of ill-de&s;ert &s;hould nece&s;&s;arily pro|duce
the dread of punishment; and that
this dread &s;hould &s;o operate on the mind,
in the time of di&s;tre&s;s, as to make the
&s;inner conceive Providence to be engaged
again&s;t him, and to be concerned in in|flicting
the puni&s;hment which he &s;uffers.
All the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions he hath &s;tamped
upon the heart with his own hand. He
hath made them con&s;tituent parts of our
frame; on purpose, that by the union of
&s;o many &s;trong and pungent &s;entiments,
he might enforce repentance and refor|mation,
and publi&s;h to the human race
his dete&s;tation of &s;in. Were he to &s;peak
to us from the clouds, his voice could not
be more deci&s;ive. What we di&s;cern to
be interwoven with the contexture of
human nature, and to pervade the whole
cour&s;e of human affairs, carries an evi|dence
not to be re&s;i&s;ted. We might, with
<PB N="405" REF="414">
as much rea&s;on, doubt whether the &s;un
was intended to enlighten the earth, or
the rain, to fertilize it; as whether he,
who thus framed the human mind, in|tended
to announce righteou&s;ne&s;s to man|kind,
as his law.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd inference which I make
from the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e, re&s;pects the
intimate connection, which tho&s;e opera|tions
of con&s;cience have, with the pecu|liar
and di&s;tingui&s;hing doctrines of the
Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. They will be found to
accord with them So remarkably, as to
furni&s;h an an&s;wer to &s;ome of tho&s;e ob|jections,
which &s;uperficial rea&s;oners are
apt to rai&s;e again&s;t the Christian revela|tion.
In particular, they coincide with
that awful view which the Go&s;pel gives
us, of the future con&s;equences of guilt.
If the &s;inner is now constrained by con|&s;cience,
to view the Almighty as pur|&s;uing
him with evil for long-forgotten
crimes, how naturally mu&s;t he conclude,
that, in a &s;ub&s;equent period of existence,
<PB N="406" REF="415">
the Divine admini&s;tration will proceed
upon the &s;ame plan, and complete what
has been left imperfect here? If, during
this life, which is only the time of trial,
the di&s;plea&s;ure of Providence at &s;in is
di&s;played by tokens &s;o manife&s;t, what
may be apprehended to follow, when ju|&s;tice,
which at pre&s;ent only begins to be
executed, &s;hall be carried to its con&s;um|mation?
What con&s;cience forebodes, reve|lation
verifies; a&s;&s;uring us, that a day is
appointed, when <HI>God will render to every
man according to his works; to them, who
by patient continuance in well-doing, &s;eek for
glory, honour, and immortality; eternal life:
But unto them that are contentious, and obey
not the truth, but obey unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; in|dignation
and wrath, tribulation and an|gui&s;h,
upon every &s;oul of man that doth evil,
of the Jew fir&s;t, and al&s;o of the Gentile. For
there is no re&s;pect of per&s;ons with God. For
as many as have &s;inned without the law,
&s;hall al&s;o peri&s;h without the law; and as
many as have &s;inned in the law, &s;hall be
judged by the law</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 7,&mdash;13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="416">
While the threatenings of con&s;cience
thus &s;trengthen the evidence of the &s;crip|ture
doctrine concerning future puni&s;h|ments,
they likewi&s;e pave the way for
the belief of what is revealed concerning
the method of our deliverance by Chri&s;t.
They &s;ugge&s;t to the &s;inner, &s;ome deep
and dark malignity contained in guilt,
which has drawn upon his head &s;uch
high di&s;plea&s;ure from Heaven. They
call forth his mo&s;t anxious efforts, to avert
the effects of that di&s;plea&s;ure, and to pro|pitiate
his offended judge. Some atone|ment,
he is con&s;cious, mu&s;t be made;
and the voice of Nature has, in every age,
loudly demanded &s;uffering, as the proper
atonement for guilt. Hence, mankind
have con&s;tantly fled for refuge to &s;uch
&s;ub&s;titutions, as they could devi&s;e to place
in the room of the offender; and, as by
general con&s;ent, victims have every where
been &s;lain, and expiatory &s;acrifices have
been offered up on innumerable altars.
<HI>Wherewith &s;hall I come before the Lord,
and bow my&s;elf before the mo&s;t high God?
<PB N="408" REF="417">
Shall I come before him with burnt offer|ings,
and calves of a year old? Will the
Lord be plea&s;ed with thousands of rams,
or with ten thousand of rivers of oil? Or, &s;hall
I give my fir&s;t born for my tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion;
the fruit of my body, for the &s;in
of my &s;oul</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Micah vi. 6, 7.</NOTE>? The&s;e perplexities, and agi|tations
of a guilty con&s;cience, may be
termed preludes, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to the
Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. They are the pointings
of unenlightened Nature, towards that
method of relief, which the grace of God
has provided. Nature felt its inability
to extricate it&s;elf from the con&s;equences
of guilt: The Go&s;pel, reveals the plan of
Divine interpo&s;ition and aid. Nature
onfe&s;&s;ed &s;ome atonement to be nece&s;|&s;ary:
The Go&s;pel, di&s;covers that the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
atonement is made. The remedy
is no &s;ooner pre&s;ented, than its &s;uitable|ne&s;s
to the di&s;ea&s;e appears; and the great
my&s;tery of redemption, though it reaches,
in its full extent, beyond our comprehen|&s;ion,
yet, as far as it is revealed, holds a
<PB N="409" REF="418">
vi&s;ible congruity with the &s;entiments of
con&s;cience, and of nature.</P>
<P>Natural and revealed religion proceed
from the &s;ame Author; and, of cour&s;e,
are analogous and con&s;i&s;tent. They are
parts of the &s;ame plan of Providence.
They are connected mea&s;ures of the &s;ame
&s;y&s;tem of government. The &s;erious be|lief
of the one, is the be&s;t preparation for
the reception of the other. Both concur
in impre&s;&s;ing our mind with a deep &s;en&s;e
of one mo&s;t important truth, which is
the re&s;ult of this whole di&s;cour&s;e, that as
<HI>we &s;ow now, we mu&s;t reap;</HI> that under
the government of God, no one &s;hall be

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>JOY and Fear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIV.</NOTE> are two great &s;prings
of human action. The mixed con|dition
of this world, gives &s;cope for
both; and, according as either predo|minates,
it influences the general tenour
of our conduct. Each of them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
a proper place in religion. To <HI>&s;erve the
Lord with gladne&s;s,</HI> is the exhortation of
the P&s;almi&s;t David<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. C. 2.</NOTE> To <HI>&s;erve him with
reverence and godly fear,</HI> is the admoni|tion

the pre&s;ent imperfection of human na|ture,
<PB N="411" REF="420">
each of the&s;e principles may be car|ried
to a dangerous extreme. When the
whole of religion is placed in joy, it is
in hazard of ri&s;ing into unwarrantable
rapture. When it re&s;ts altogether on
fear, it degenerates into &s;uper&s;titious &s;er|vility.
The Text enjoins a due mixture
of both; and inculcates this important
maxim, That joy, tempered with fear, is
the proper di&s;po&s;ition of a good man.
In di&s;cour&s;ing of this &s;ubject, I &s;hall
endeavour to &s;how, fir&s;t, That joy is
e&s;&s;ential to religion; and next, That, for
for various rea&s;ons, this joy ought to be
mixed with fear; whence, we &s;hall be
able to a&s;certain the nature of that &s;teady
and compo&s;ed &s;pirit, which is mo&s;t &s;uit|able
to our pre&s;ent condition, and mo&s;t
acceptable to the God whom we &s;erve.</P>
<P>I. JOY is e&s;&s;ential to religion in two
re&s;pects; as religion in&s;pires joy, and as
it requires it. In other words; To rejoice,
is both the privilege, and the duty, of
good men.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="421">
In the fir&s;t place, religion in&s;pires joy.
It affords ju&s;t ground of gladne&s;s, to all
who firmly believe its doctrines, and &s;in|cerely
&s;tudy to obey its laws; For it con|fers
on them, the two mo&s;t material re|quisites
of joy; a favourable &s;ituation of
things without, and a proper di&s;po&s;ition
of mind within, to reli&s;h that favourable
&s;ituation.</P>
<P>When they examine their &s;ituation
without, they behold them&s;elves placed
in a world, which is full of the influence
of a gracious Providence; where beauty
and good are every where predominant;
where various comforts are be&s;towed;
and where, if any be with-held, they have
rea&s;on to believe, that they are with-held
by parental Wi&s;dom. Among the crowd
that encompa&s;s them, they may be at a
lo&s;s to di&s;cern, who are their friends, and
who their enemies. But it is &s;ufficient to
know, that they are under the protection
of an invi&s;ible Guardian, who&s;e power
can keep them from every evil. All the
&s;teps of his conduct, they may be unable
<PB N="413" REF="422">
to trace. Events may befall them, of
which they can give no account. But as
long as they are &s;ati&s;fied, that the &s;y&s;tem of
Divine government is founded on mercy,
no pre&s;ent occurrences are able to de&s;troy
their peace. <HI>For he who &s;pared not his own
Son, but delivered him up for them, how
&s;hall he not with him, freely give them all
things?</HI> If their nature is frail, Divine
a&s;&s;i&s;tance is promi&s;ed to &s;trengthen it. If
their virtue is imperfect, a di&s;pen&s;ation is
opened, which gives them the hope of
pardon. If their external circum&s;tances
be in any re&s;pect unfavourable, it is be|cau&s;e
a higher intere&s;t is con&s;ulted. <HI>All
things,</HI> they are a&s;&s;ured, <HI>&s;hall work toge|ther
for their good.</HI> On their pro&s;perity
re&s;ts, the ble&s;&s;ing; on their adver&s;ity, the
&s;anctifying &s;pirit, of the Almighty. Old
age may advance, and life decay; but
beyond tho&s;e boundaries of Nature, faith
opens the pro&s;pect of their la&s;ting felicity.
Without anxiety, they pa&s;s through the
different periods of their pre&s;ent exi&s;tence,
<PB N="414" REF="423">
becau&s;e they know it to be no more than
an introduction, to immortality.</P>
<P>As &s;uch a &s;ituation of things without,
lays a &s;olid foundation for joy, &s;o the di&s;|po&s;ition
which religion forms within, pro|motes
the reli&s;h of it. It is indeed from
within, that the chief &s;ources of enjoy|ment
or trouble ri&s;e. The minds of bad
men are always di&s;orderly; and hence
their lives are &s;o generally unea&s;y. In vain
<HI>they take the timbrel and the harp, and</HI> en|deavour
to <HI>rejoice at the &s;ound of the organ.</HI>
Spleen and di&s;gu&s;t pur&s;ue them, through
all the haunts of amu&s;ement. Pride and
ill humour torment them. Oppressed
with di&s;content, their &s;pirits flag; and
their worn-out plea&s;ures, a&s;&s;ord them en|tertainment
no more. But religion &s;ub|dues
tho&s;e malignant pa&s;&s;ions, which are
the troublers of human repo&s;e; which
either overca&s;t the mind with the gloom of
peevi&s;hne&s;s, or di&s;quiet it by the violence
of agitation. It infu&s;es, in their room,
tho&s;e mild and gentle di&s;po&s;itions, who&s;e
natural effect is to &s;mooth the tenour of
<PB N="415" REF="424">
the &s;oul. Benevolence and candour, mo|deration
and temperance, wherever they
reign, produce chearfulne&s;s and &s;erenity.
The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of integrity, gives ca&s;e
and freedom to the mind. It enables
good men to extract from every object,
the whole &s;atisfaction which it is capable
of yielding; and adds the flavour of in|nocence,
to all their external plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, As religion natu|rally
in&s;pires joy, &s;o, what it in&s;pires, it
commands us to cheri&s;h. As a nece&s;&s;ary
proof of our &s;incerity, it requires chear|fulne&s;s
in the performance of our duty;
becau&s;e, if this be wanting, our religion
di&s;covers it&s;elf not to be genuine in prin|ciple,
and in practice it cannot be &s;table.</P>
<P>Religious obedience, de&s;itute of joy, is
not genuine in its principle. For did
either faith or hope, the love of God, or
the love of goodne&s;s, rule the heart; they
could not fail to produce &s;atisfaction in
piety and virtue. All tho&s;e cau&s;es of joy
which I have mentioned, would then ope|rate;
<PB N="416" REF="425">
rate; and their native effect on the mind,
would follow. The pro&s;pects which re|ligion
opens, would gladden, and the af|fections
which it in&s;pires, would &s;ooth
the heart. We &s;erve with plea&s;ure, the
benefactor whom we love. We rejoice
in every &s;tudy and pur&s;uit, to which we
are &s;incerely attached. If we &s;erve not
God with plea&s;ure, it is becau&s;e we know
him not, or love him not. If we rejoice
not in virtue, it is becau&s;e our affection
is alienated from it, and our inclinations
are depraved. We give too evident proof,
that either we believe not the principles
of religion, or that we feel not their
power. Exclude joy from religion; and
you leave no other motives to it, except
compul&s;ion and intere&s;t. But are the&s;e
&s;uitable grounds, on which to re&s;t the
whole of our obedience to the Supreme
Being? <HI>My &s;on give me thy heart,</HI> is the
call of God. Surely if there be no plea|&s;ure
in fulfilling his commands, the heart
is not given to him; and, in that ca&s;e,
<PB N="417" REF="426">
<HI>the multitude of &s;acrifices, and burnt offer|ings,</HI>
is brought to his altar in vain</P>
<P>As religion, de&s;titute of joy, is imperfect
in its principle, &s;o, in practice, it mu&s;t be
un&s;table. In vain, you endeavour to fix
any man to the regular performance of
that, in which he finds no plea&s;ure. Bind
him ever &s;o fa&s;t by intere&s;t or fear, he
will contrive &s;ome method of eluding the
obligation. Ingenuity is never &s;o fertile
of eva&s;ions, as where plea&s;ure is all on
the one &s;ide, and mere precept on the
other. He may &s;tudy to &s;ave appearances.
He may di&s;&s;emble and con&s;train him&s;elf.
But his heart revolts in &s;ecret; and the
weight of inclination, will, in the end,
draw the practice after it. If per&s;everance
is not to be expected, &s;till le&s;s can zeal
be looked for, from him, who, in his re|ligious
duties, trembles without rejoicing.
Every attempt towards virtue which he
forms, will be feeble and awkward. He
applies to it as a ta&s;k; he dreads the ta&s;k|ma&s;ter;
but he will labour no more, than
nece&s;&s;ity enjoins. To e&s;cape from puni&s;h|ment,
<PB N="418" REF="427">
is his &s;ole aim. He bargains for
immunity, by every duty which he per|forms;
and all beyond, he e&s;teems &s;u|perfluous
toil.&mdash;Such religion as this, can
neither purify the heart, nor prepare for
heavenly bli&s;s. It is the refuge of an ab|ject
mind. It may form the ritual of the
monk, or pre&s;cribe the penance of the
idolater; but has no concern with the ho|mage
of him, who <HI>wor&s;hips the Father in
&s;pirit and in truth.</HI> His character is, that
<HI>the joy of the Lord is his &s;trength</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Neh. Viii. 1&punc;</NOTE>. It at|taches
his heart to religion. It in&s;pires his
zeal. It &s;upports his con&s;tancy; and ac|celerates
his progres&s;.</P>
<P>There is no man, but has &s;ome object
to which he cleaves for enjoyment; &s;ome|what
that flatters him with di&s;tant hope,
or affords him pre&s;ent plea&s;ure. Joy is
the end towards which all rational beings
tend. For the &s;ake of it, they live; it re|&s;embles
the air they breath, which is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for the motion of the heart, and
all the vital functions. But as the breath|ing
of infected air proves fatal to life; in
<PB N="419" REF="428">
the &s;ame manner, joy drawn from a cor|rupted
&s;ource, is de&s;tructive, both of vir|tue,
and of true happine&s;s. When you
have no plea&s;ure in goodne&s;s, you may
with certainty conclude the rea&s;on to be,
that your plea&s;ure is all derived from an
oppo&s;ite quarter. You have exhau&s;ted
your affection upon the world. You have
drunk too much of its poi&s;oned waters,
to have any reli&s;h for a pure &s;pring.</P>
<P>E&s;timate, therefore, the genuinene&s;s of
your religious principles, e&s;timate the de|gree
of your &s;tability in religious prac|tice,
by the degree of your &s;atisfaction in
piety and virtue. Be &s;&s;ured, that where
your trea&s;ure is, there will your delight
be al&s;o. The worldly man rejoices in his
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; the voluptuous, in his plea|&s;ures;
the &s;ocial, in his friends and com|panions.
The truly good man, rejoices in
<HI>doing ju&s;tly, loving mercy, and walking
humbly with the Lord his God.</HI> He is hap|py,
when employed in the regular di&s;|charge
of the great duties of life. Spon|taneous
and chearful, they flow from the
<PB N="420" REF="429">
affections of a pure heart. Not only
from the keeping of the Divine com|mandments
he expects, but <HI>in the keeping
of them,</HI> he enjoys, <HI>a great reward.</HI>&mdash;Ac|cordingly,
in the &s;entiments of holy men
recorded in &s;cripture, we find this &s;pirit
every-where prevalent. Their language
was; <HI>Thy &s;tatutes have I taken at mine he|ritage
for ever; for they are the rejoicing of
my heart. They are my &s;ongs in the hou&s;e of
my pilgrimage. They are &s;weeter than honey,
and the honey comb. Whom have I in hea|ven
but thee? And there is none upon earth
that I de&s;ire be&s;ides thee.</HI> They did not re|ceive
<HI>the &s;pirit of bondage, but the &s;pirit of
adoption. They were filled with peace and
joy in believing. They rejoiced in hope of the
glory of God.</HI> As &s;oon as the AEthiopian
eunuch received from Philip the light of
the Go&s;pel, that light revived and chear|ed
his heart. A new &s;un &s;eemed to ari&s;e;
a new glory, to &s;hine around him. Every
object brightened; <HI>and he went on his
way rejoicing</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Acts viii. 39.</NOTE>. After the &s;ame manner
<PB N="421" REF="430">
should every good man proceed in his
journey through life, with a &s;erene and
chearful &s;pirit. Con&s;ternation and de|jection
let him leave to the &s;laves of guilt,
who have every thing to dread, both from
this world, and the next. If he appear
before others with a di&s;pirited a&s;pect, he
di&s;honours religion; and affords ground,
for &s;uspicion, that he is either ignorant
of its nature, or a &s;tranger to its power.</P>
<P>Thus I have &s;hown joy to be e&s;&s;ential
to religion. It is the &s;prit which it in|&s;pires,
and which it requires, in good
men. But in our pre&s;ent &s;tate, the be&s;t
principles may be carried to a dangerous
exce&s;s; and joy, like other things, has
its due limits. To &s;erve God with un|mixed
delight, belongs to more advan|ced
&s;pirits in a happier world. In this
region of imperfection, &s;ome infu&s;ions
from a different cup, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity
tincture our joy. Let us then,</P>
<P>II. TURN to the other &s;ide of the ar|gument,
and con&s;ider the rea&s;ons which
<PB N="422" REF="431">
render it proper, that when we rejoice,
we &s;hould <HI>rejoice with trembling.</HI></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, bccau&s;e all the ob|jects
of religion, which afford ground
for joy, tend to in&s;pire, at the &s;ame time,
reverence and fear. We &s;erve a Bene|factor,
it is true, in whom we have rea|&s;on
to delight; who&s;e purpo&s;es are gra|cious;
who&s;e law is the plan of our
happine&s;s. But this Benefactor, is the
<HI>King eternal, immortal, and invisible;</HI> at
who&s;e pre&s;ence, the mountains &s;hake,
and Nature trembles. <HI>Every good, and
every perfect gift come down from him.</HI>
But the hand which confers them, we
cannot &s;ee. My&s;terious ob&s;curity re&s;ts
upon his e&s;&s;ence. He dwelleth <HI>in the &s;e|cret
place of thunder;</HI> and clouds and
darkne&s;s &s;urround him. He is the
<HI>Hearer of prayer;</HI> but we lift our voice
to him from afar. Into his immediate
pre&s;ence no acce&s;s is permitted. Our
warme&s;t devotion admits no familiarity
with him. <HI>God is in heaven, and then
upon earth; therefore, let thy words be
<PB N="423" REF="432">
few.</HI> If his omni&s;cience admini&s;ters com|fort
in our &s;ecret di&s;tre&s;s, it likewi&s;e fills
with awe, the heart that is con&s;cious of
guilt. For, if he <HI>knows our frame, and
remembers we are du&s;t; our iniquities,</HI> al&s;o,
<HI>are ever before him; our &s;ecret &s;ins, in the
light of his countenance.</HI></P>
<P>Throughout all his di&s;pen&s;ations, great|ne&s;s,
in conjunction with goodne&s;s, &s;trikes
our view; and, wherever we behold the
Parent, we behold the Legi&s;lator al&s;o. The
death of Chri&s;t, in the behalf of a guilty
world, is the chief ground of religious
hope and joy. But it is no le&s;s the
ground of reverence; when, in this high
tran&s;action, we contemplate God, as at
once &s;trict in ju&s;tice, and great in mercy.
<HI>I the Lord keep mercy for thou&s;ands of them
that fear me. I forgive their iniquity, tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion,
and &s;in; but I will by no means
clear the guilty.</HI> When we open the book
of the Law, we find promi&s;es and threat|enings
mingled in the &s;ame page. On
the one &s;ide, we &s;ee Heaven di&s;played
in all its glory: On the other, Hell
<PB N="424" REF="433">
opening its terrours. In &s;hort, in what|ever
light we view religion, it appear$
&s;olemn and venerable. It is a temple
full of maje&s;ty, to which the wor&s;hippers
may approach with comfort, in the hope
of <HI>obtaining grace, and finding mercy;</HI> but
where they cannot enter, without being
impre&s;&s;ed with awe. If we may be per|mitted
to compare &s;piritual with natural
things, religion re&s;embles not tho&s;e &s;cenes
of natural beauty, where every object
&s;miles. It cannot be likened to the gay
land&s;cape, or the flowery field. It re|&s;embles
more the augu&s;t and &s;ublime ap|pearances
of Nature; the lofty mountain,
the expanded ocean, and the &s;tarry firma|ment;
at the &s;ight of which, the mind
is at once over-awed and delighted; and,
from the union of grandeur with beau|ty,
derives a plea&s;ing, but a &s;erious, emo|tion.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, As joy, tempered
by fear, &s;uits the nature of religion, &s;o,
it is requi&s;ite for the proper regulation of
<PB N="425" REF="434">
the conduct of man. Let his joy flow
from the be&s;t and pure&s;t &s;ource; yet, if it
remain long unmixed, it is apt to become
dangerous to virtue. As waters which
are never &s;tirred, nor troubled, gather a
&s;ediment, which putrifies them; &s;o, the
undi&s;turbed continuance of placid &s;en&s;a|tions,
engenders di&s;orders in the human
&s;oul. It is wi&s;ely ordered in our pre&s;ent
&s;tate, that joy and fear, hope and grief,
&s;hould act alternately, as checks and ba|lances
upon each other, in order to pre|vent
an exce&s;s in any of them, which
our nature could not bear. If we were
&s;ubject to no alarms of danger, the
wi&s;e&s;t would &s;oon become improvident;
and the mo&s;t humble, pre&s;umptuous.
Man is a pilgrim on earth. Were his
path to be always &s;mooth and flowery,
he would be tempted to relinqui&s;h his
guide, and to forget the purpo&s;e of his
journey. Caution and fear, are the
&s;hields of happine&s;s. Unguarded joy
begets indolence; indolence produces &s;e|curity;
&s;ecurity leads to ra&s;hne&s;s; and
<PB N="426" REF="435">
ra&s;hne&s;s ends in ruin. In order to re|joice
long, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we <HI>rejoice
with trembling.</HI> Had our fir&s;t parents
ob&s;erved this rule, man might have been
&s;till in Paradi&s;e. He who faith in his
heart, <HI>My mountain &s;tands &s;trong; I &s;hall
never be moved;</HI> may be a&s;&s;ured that his
&s;tate already begins to totter. Religion,
therefore, performs a kind office, in giv|ing
us the admonition of the Text. It
in&s;pires chearfulne&s;s in the &s;ervice of
God. It propo&s;es joy, as our chief &s;pring
of action. But it &s;upports joy, by guard|ing
it with fear; not &s;uppre&s;&s;ing, but
regulating its indulgence; requiring us
to rejoice, like per&s;ons who have obtained
a trea&s;ture, which, through want of vigi|lance,
they are expo&s;ed to lo&s;e. De|pendent
beings are formed for &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion;
and, to &s;ubmit, is to &s;tand in awe.
<HI>Becau&s;e the Lord reigneth, let the earth be
glad.</HI> We are the &s;ubjects of God; and
therefore may ju&s;tly rejoice. But &s;till we
are &s;ubjects; and, therefore, trembling
mu&s;t mix with our joy.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="436">
IN the third place, the un&s;table condi|tion
of all human things, naturally in|&s;pires
fear in the mids;t of joy. The
&s;pirit to which religion forms us, mu&s;t
undoubtedly, corre&s;pond to the &s;tate in
which we are placed, and to the part
which is a&s;&s;igned us to act. Now, the
fir&s;t view under which our pre&s;ent &s;tate
appears, is that of fallen creatures, who
are undergoing, in this world, probation
and trial for their recovery; and are com|manded
to <HI>work out their &s;alvation with
fear and trembling.</HI> This view of our
condition, infers not habitual dejection
of mind. It requires not melancholy
abstraction from the affairs, or total con|tempt
of the amu&s;ements, of life. But it
in&s;pires humility. It enforces dependance
on Divine aid; and calls forth the voice
of &s;upplication to Heaven. In a &s;ituation
&s;o critical, and where intere&s;ts &s;o import|ant
are at &s;take, every rea&s;onable per&s;on
mu&s;t confe&s;s, that &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s ought to
temper rejoicing.</P>
<P><PB N="428" REF="437">
Were there in human life any fixed
point of &s;tability and re&s;t, attainable by
man; could we, at any one moment, a&s;|&s;ure
our&s;elves, that there remained no la|tent
&s;ource of danger, either to our tem|poral,
or our &s;piritual &s;tate; then, I ad|mit,
we might lay trembling a&s;ide, and
rejoice in full &s;ecurity. But, alas! no
&s;uch &s;afe &s;tation, no &s;uch moment of
confidence, is allowed to man during his
warfare on earth. Vici&s;&s;itudes of good
and evil, of trials and con&s;olations, fill
up his life. The be&s;t intentioned, are
&s;ometimes betrayed into crimes; the mo&s;t
prudent, overwhelmed with misfortunes.
The world is like a wheel ince&s;&s;antly re|volving,
on which human things alter|nately
ri&s;e and fall. What is pa&s;t of our
life, has been a checquered &s;cene. On its
remaining periods, uncertainty and dark|ne&s;s
re&s;t. Futurity is an unknown re|gion,
into which no man can look for|ward
without awe, becau&s;e he cannot tell
what forms of danger, or trial, may meet
him there. This we know well, that, in
<PB N="429" REF="438">
every period of our life, the path of hap|pine&s;s
&s;hall be found &s;teep and arduous;
but &s;wift and ea&s;y, the de&s;cent to ruin.
What, with much exertion of care and
vigilance, we had built up, one unwary
action may, in an evil hour, overthrow.
The props of human confidence are, in
general, in&s;ecure. The &s;phere of human
plea&s;ures is narrow. While we form
&s;chemes, for &s;trengthening the one, and
for enlarging the other, death, in the
mean-while, advances. Life, with a &s;wift,
though in&s;en&s;ible cour&s;e, glides away;
and, like a river which undermines its
banks, gradually impairs our &s;tate. Year
after year, &s;teals &s;omething from us; till
the decaying fabrick totter of it&s;elf, and
crumble at length into du&s;t. So that,
whether we con&s;ider life or death, time
or eternity, all things appear to concur
in giving to man the admonition of the
Text, <HI>Rejoice with trembling.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE now &s;hown, in what re&s;pects
religion both promotes joy, and inspires
<PB N="430" REF="439">
&s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. It places us in the mo&s;t fa|vourable
&s;ituation, which human life af|fords,
for joy; and it gives us every a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
for reli&s;hing that joy. It reanders
it our duty, to cultivate the &s;atisfaction
which it yields. It demands a chearful
&s;pirit, in order to a&s;certain the &s;incerity
of our principles, and to confirm us in
good practice. At the &s;ame time, the
joy which it in&s;pires, is tempered with
fear, by the genius of religion it&s;elf,
by the dangers to which unguarded joy
would expo&s;e us, and by the impropriety
of indulging it, in a &s;ituation &s;o mixed as
the pre&s;ent. The <HI>trembling</HI> which is here
enjoined, is not to be under&s;tood as &s;ig|nifying
a pu&s;illanimous dejection. It im|ports
no more than that caution and &s;o|briety,
which prudence dictates, as be|longing
to our &s;tate. By connecting &s;uch
trembling with our joy, religion means
to recommend to us, a chearful, but a
compo&s;ed, &s;pirit; equally remote from
the humiliating depre&s;&s;ion of fear, and
the exulting levity of joy. Always to re|joice,
<PB N="431" REF="440">
is to be a fool. Always to tremble,
is to be a &s;lave. It is a mode&s;t chearful|ne&s;s,
a cha&s;tened joy, a manly &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s,
which becomes the &s;ervant of God.</P>
<P>BUT is this, it may perhaps be &s;aid,
the whole amount of that boa&s;ted &s;ati&s;|faction
which religion be&s;tows? Is this
all the compen&s;ation which it makes, for
tho&s;e &s;acrifices it exacts? Are not the
terms which vice holds out, far moreenticing,
when it permits us to gratify
every de&s;ire; and, in return for our &s;ur|mounting
the timorous &s;cruples of con|&s;cience,
promi&s;es us a life of gaiety, fe|&s;tivity,
and unre&s;trained joy?&mdash;Such
promi&s;es, vice may indeed make; but,
how far it fulfils them, we may &s;afely
refer to the determination of the greate&s;t
&s;en&s;uali&s;t, when he has fini&s;hed his ca|reer,
and looks back on what he has en|joyed.
A&s;k him, Whether he would re|commend
to his children, and his friends,
to hold the &s;ame cour&s;e; and whether,
with his dying breath, he dare a&s;&s;ure
<PB N="432" REF="441">
them, that the gratifications of licenti|ou&s;ne&s;s
afford the greate&s;t enjoyment of
life? Whatever hopes vice may at the
beginning in&s;pire, yet, after the trial is
made, it has been always found, that
criminal plea&s;ures are the bane of happi|ne&s;s;
the poi&s;on, not the cordial, of our
pre&s;ent &s;tate. They are plea&s;ures, com|pen&s;ated
by an infinite overbalance of
pain; moments of delight, &s;ucceeded by
years of regret; purcha&s;ed at the expence
of injured reputation, broken health, and
ruined peace. Even ab&s;tracting from
their pernicious con&s;equences, they are,
for mo&s;t part, in them&s;elves treacherous
plea&s;ures; un&s;ound, and di&s;turbed in the
moments of enjoyment. <HI>In the mid&s;t of
&s;uch laughter, the heart is &s;orrowful.</HI> Of|ten
is the &s;mile of gaiety a&s;&s;umed, while
the heart akes within: And though folly
laughs, guilt will &s;ting. Correcting this
pernicious phrenzy of plea&s;ure, and re|ducing
it to a more &s;ober and regulated
&s;tate, religion is, in truth, no other than
wi&s;dom, introducing peace and order into
the life of man.</P>
<P><PB N="433" REF="442">
While religion condemns &s;uch plea|&s;ures
as are immoral, it is chargeable
with no improper au&s;terity, in re&s;pect of
tho&s;e&punc; which are of an innocent kind.
Think not, that by the cautious di&s;ci|pline
which it pre&s;cribes, it excludes you
from all gay enjoyment of life. With|in
the compa&s;s of that &s;edate &s;pirit, to
which it forms you, all that is innocent|ly
pleasing will be found to lie. It is a
mi&s;take to imagine, that, in con&s;tant ef|fu&s;ions
of giddy mirth, or in that flut|ter
of &s;pirits which is excited by a round
of diver&s;ions, the chief enjoyment of our
&s;tate con&s;i&s;ts. Were this the ca&s;e, the
vain and the frivolous would be on bet|ter
terms for happine&s;s, than the wi&s;e,
the great, and the good. To arrange
the plans of amu&s;ement, or to pre&s;ide in
the haunts of jollity, would be more de|&s;irable,
than to exert the highe&s;t effort of
mental powers for the benefit of na|tions.
A con&s;equence &s;o ab&s;urd, is &s;uffi|cient
to explode the principle from which
it flows. To the amu&s;ements and le&s;&s;er
<PB N="434" REF="443">
joys of the world, religion a&s;&s;igns their
proper place. It admits of them, as relax|ations
from care, as in&s;truments of pro|moting
the union of men, and of enliven|ing
their &s;ocial intercour&s;e. But though,
as long as they are kept within due bounds,
it does not cen&s;ure nor condemn them;
neither does it propo&s;e them, as rewards
to the virtuous, or as the principal ob|jects
of their pur&s;uit. To &s;uch, it points
out nobler ends of action. Their felicity
it engages them to &s;eek, in the discharge
of an u&s;eful, an upright, and honourable
part in life; and, as the habitual tenour
of their mind, it promotes chearfulne&s;s,
and discourages levity.</P>
<P>Between the&s;e two, there is a wide di|&s;tinction;
and the mind which is mo&s;t
open to levity, is frequently a &s;tranger to
chearfulne&s;s. It has been remarked, that
tran&s;ports of intemperate mirth, are of|ten
no more than fla&s;hes from the dark
cloud; and that, in proportion to the vio|lence
of the effulgence, &s;uch is the &s;uc|ceeding
gloom. Levity, may be the for|ced
<PB N="435" REF="444">
production of folly or vice; chear|fulne&s;s,
is the natural offspring of wi&s;|dom
and virtue only. The one is an oc|ca&s;ional
agitation; the other, a perma|nent
habit. The one degrades the cha|racter;
the other, is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent
with the dignity of rea&s;on, and the
&s;teady and manly &s;pirit of religion. To
aim at a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of high and
vivid &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure, is an idea of
happine&s;s altogether chimerical. Calm
and temperate enjoyment, is the utmo&s;t
that is allotted to man. Beyond this, we
&s;truggle in vain to rai&s;e our &s;tate; and, in
fact, depre&s;s our joys, by endeavouring
to heighten them. In&s;tead of tho&s;e vain
hopes of perpetual fe&s;tivity, with which
the world would allure us, religion con|fers
upon us, a chearful tranquillity. In|&s;tead
of dazzling us with meteors of joy,
which &s;parkle and expire, it &s;heds around
us, a calm and &s;teady light. By mixing
trembling with our joy, it renders that
joy more &s;olid, more equal, and more
la&s;ting.</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="445">
In this &s;pirit, then, let us &s;erve God,
and hold our cour&s;e through life. Let
us approach to the Divine Being, as to
a &s;overeign of whom we &s;tand in awe,
and to a father in whom we tru&s;t. In
our conduct, let us be cautious and hum|ble,
as tho&s;e who have ground to fear;
well plea&s;led and chearful, as tho&s;e who
have cau&s;e to rejoice. Let us &s;how the
world, that a religious temper, is a tem|per,
&s;edate, not &s;ad; that a religious be|haviour,
is a behaviour, regulated, not
&s;tiff and formal. Thus, we &s;hall <HI>u&s;e the

through its various changes, with the
lea&s;t di&s;compo&s;ure; and we &s;hall vindi|cate
religion, from the reproaches of tho&s;e
who would attribute to it, either enthu&s;i|a&s;tick
joys, or &s;lavi&s;h terrours. We &s;hall
&s;how, that it is a rational rule of life,
worthy of the perfection of God, and

di&s;&s;atisfaction, which corrupts every ter|re&s;trial
enjoyment, &s;hould have &s;ometimes
penetrated into the region of virtue.
Good men are not without their frailties;
and the perver&s;ene&s;s incident to human
nature, too readily leads us, who weary
of all other things, to <HI>weary,</HI> al&s;o, <HI>in
well-doing.</HI></P>
<P>Let me put a ca&s;e, which, perhaps,
will be found not unfrequent in ordinary
life. Suppo&s;e a per&s;on, after much com|merce
with the world, to be convinced of
its vanity. He has &s;een its mo&s;t flat|tering
hopes to be fallacious. He has felt
its mo&s;t boa&s;ted plea&s;ures to be un&s;a|ti&s;factory.
He re&s;olves, therefore, to
place his happine&s;s in virtue; and, di&s;|regarding
all temptations from intere&s;t,
to adhere to what is right and honour|able
in conduct. He cultivates acquaint|ance
with religion. He performs, with
&s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, the offices of devotion. He
lays down to him&s;elf, a rational and
<PB N="439" REF="448">
u&s;eful plan of life; and, with &s;atisfac|tion,
holds on for a while in this reform|ed
cour&s;e. But, by degrees, di&s;courage|ments
ari&s;e. The peace which he hoped
to enjoy, is interrupted, either by his
own frailties, or by the vices of others.
Pa&s;&s;ions, which had not been thoroughly
&s;ubdued, &s;truggle for their accu&s;tomed
gratification. The plea&s;ure which he ex|pected
to find in devotion, &s;ometimes
fails him; and the inju&s;tice of the world,
often &s;ours and frets him. Friends prove
ungrateful; enemies mi&s;repre&s;ent, rivals
&s;upplant him: And part, at lea&s;t, of the
mortifications which he &s;uffers, he begins
to a&s;cribe to virtue.&mdash;Is this all the re|ward
of my &s;erving God, and renouncing
the plea&s;ures of &s;in? <HI>Verily, in vain, I
have clean&s;ed my heart, and wa&s;hed my
hands in innocency. Behold, the ungodly
pro&s;per in the world, and have more than
heart can wi&s;h; while, all the day long,
I am plagued and cha&s;tened every morning.</HI>&mdash;
To &s;uch per&s;ons as the&s;e, and to all who
are in hazarda of being infected with their
<PB N="440" REF="449">
&s;pirit, I now addre&s;s my&s;elf. In reply to
their complaints, I purpo&s;e to &s;how, That
in no &s;tate they can choo&s;e on earth, by
no plan of conduct they can form, is it
po&s;&s;ible for them to e&s;cape unea&s;ine&s;s and
di&s;appointment; that in a life of virtue,
they will &s;uffer le&s;s unea&s;ine&s;s and fewer
di&s;appointments, than in a cour&s;e of vice;
they will po&s;&s;e&s;s much higher re&s;ources
and advantages; and they will be a&s;|&s;ured
of complete reward at the end.
From the&s;e con&s;iderations, I hope to make
it appear, that there is no &s;ufficient rea|&s;on
for our <HI>wearying in well-doing;</HI> and
that, taking human life upon the whole,
virtue is by far the mo&s;t eligible portion
of man.</P>
<P>I. Unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;appointment, are
in&s;eparable, in &s;ome degree, from every
&s;tate on earth. Were it in the power of
the world, to render tho&s;e who attach
them&s;elves to it, &s;ati&s;fied and happy, you
might then, I admit, have &s;ome title to
complain, if you found your&s;elves placed
<PB N="441" REF="450">
upon wor&s;e terms in the &s;ervice of God.
But this is &s;o far from being the ca&s;e,
that, among the multitudes who devote
them&s;elves to earthly plea&s;ure, you will
not find a &s;ingle per&s;on who has com|pletely
attained his aim. Enquire into
the condition of the high and the low,
of the gay and the &s;erious, of the men of
bu&s;ine&s;s and the men of plea&s;ure, and
you &s;hall behold them all occupied, in
&s;upplying &s;ome want, or in removing
&s;ome di&s;tre&s;s. No man is plea&s;ed with
being preci&s;ely what he is. Every-where
there is a void; generally, even in the
mo&s;t pro&s;perous life, there is &s;ome corner
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by &s;orrow. He who is engaged in
bu&s;ine&s;s, pines for lei&s;ure. He who en|joys
lei&s;ure, langui&s;hes for want of em|ployment.
In a &s;ingle &s;tate, we envy the
comforts of a family. In conjugal life,
we are chagrined with dome&s;tick cares.
In a &s;afe &s;tation, we regret the want of
objects for enterpri&s;e. In an enterprizing
life, we lament the want of &s;afety. It is
the doom of man, that his &s;ky &s;hould
<PB N="442" REF="451">
never be free from all clouds. He is, at
pre&s;ent, in an exiled and fallen &s;tate.
The objects which &s;urround him, are be|neath
his native dignity. God has tin|ged
them all with vanity, on purpo&s;e to
make him feel, that this is not his re&s;t;
that here he is not in his proper place,
nor arrived at his true home.</P>
<P>If, therefore, you aim at a condition
which &s;hall be exempted from every di&s;|quiet,
you pur&s;ue a phantom; you in|crea&s;e
the vanity and vexation of life, by
engaging in a chace &s;o fruitle&s;s. If you
complain of virtue, becau&s;e there is inci|dent
to it a portion of that unea&s;ine&s;s
which is found in every other &s;tate, your
complaint is mo&s;t unrea&s;onable. You
claim an immunity from evil, which be|longs
not to the lot of man. Recon|cile
your&s;elves, then, to your condition;
and, in&s;tead of looking for perfect hap|pine&s;s
any where on earth, gladly embrace
that &s;tate which contains the fewe&s;t &s;or|rows.</P>
<P><PB N="443" REF="452">
II. THOUGH no condition of human
life is free from unea&s;ine&s;s, I contend,
that the unea&s;ine&s;s belonging to a &s;inful
cour&s;e, is far greater, than what attends a
cour&s;e of well-doing. If you weary of
the labours of virtue, be a&s;&s;ured that the
world, whenever you try the exchange,
will lay upon you a much heavier load. It
is the out&s;ide, only, of a licentious life,
which is gay and &s;miling. Within, it con|ceals
toil, and trouble, and deadly &s;orrow.
For, vice poi&s;ons human happine&s;s in the
&s;pring, by introducing di&s;order into the
heart. Tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which it &s;eems to
indulge, it only feeds with imperfect
gratifications; and thereby &s;trengthens
them for preying, in the end, on their
unhappy victims.</P>
<P>It is a great mi&s;take to imagine, that
the pain of &s;elf-denial is confined to vir|tue.
He who follows the world, as much
as he who follows Chri&s;t, mu&s;t <HI>take up his
cro&s;s;</HI> and to him, a&s;&s;uredly, it will prove
a more oppre&s;&s;ive burden. Vice allows all
our pa&s;&s;ions to range uncontrouled; and
<PB N="444" REF="453">
where each claims to be &s;uperiour, it is
impo&s;&s;ible to gratify all. The predomi|nant
de&s;ire, can only be indulged at the
expence of its rival. No mortifications
which virtue exacts, are more &s;evere than
tho&s;e, which ambition impo&s;es upon the
love of ea&s;e, pride upon intere&s;t, and
covetou&s;ne&s;s upon vanity. Self-denial,
therefore, belongs, in common, to vice
and virtue; but with this remarkable
difference, that the pa&s;&s;ions which virtue
requires us to mortify, it tends to wea|ken;
whereas, tho&s;e which vice obliges
us to deny, it, at the &s;ame time, &s;trength|ens.
The one dimini&s;hes the pain of
&s;elf-denial, by moderating the demands
of pa&s;&s;ion; the other increa&s;es it, by ren|dering
tho&s;e demands imperious and vio|lent.
&mdash;What di&s;tre&s;&s;es, that occur in the
calm life of virtue, can be compared to
tho&s;e tortures, which remor&s;e of con&s;ci|ence
inflicts on the wicked; to tho&s;e
&s;evere humiliations, ari&s;ing from guilt
combined with misfortunes, which &s;ink
them to the du&s;t; to tho&s;e violent agita|tions
<PB N="445" REF="454">
of &s;hame and disappointment,
which &s;ometimes drive them to the mo&s;t
fatal extremities, and make them abhor
their exi&s;tence? How often, in the mid&s;t
of tho&s;e di&s;a&s;trous &s;ituations, into which
their crimes have brought them, have
they cur&s;ed the &s;eductions of vice; and,
with bitter regret, looked back to the day
on which they fir&s;t for&s;ook the path of
innocence!</P>
<P>But, perhaps, you imagine, that to &s;uch
mi&s;eries as the&s;e, great criminals only are
expo&s;ed; and that, by a wary and cautious
management, it is po&s;&s;ible to avoid them.
Take vice and virtue, then, in the mo&s;t
general point of view. Compare God and
the world as two ma&s;ters, the one or other
of whom you mu&s;t obey; and con&s;ider
fairly, in who&s;e &s;ervice there will be rea|&s;on
for your wearying &s;oone&s;t, and repent|ing
mo&s;t frequently. The world is both
a hard, and a capricious ma&s;ter. To &s;ub|mit
to a long &s;ervitude, in the view of a
recompen&s;e from which they are excluded,
in the end, is known to be often, the fate
<PB N="446" REF="455">
of tho&s;e, who are devoted to the world.
They &s;acrifice their pre&s;ent ea&s;e, to their
future pro&s;pects. They court the great,
and flatter the multitude. They pro&s;ti|tute
their con&s;cience, and di&s;honour their
character: And, after all their efforts, how
uncertain is their &s;ucce&s;s! Competitors
ju&s;tle, and out&s;trip them. The more art|ful
deceive, the more violent overthrow
them. Fair pro&s;pects once &s;miled; but
clouds &s;oon gather; the &s;ky is darkened;
the &s;cene changes; and that fickle world,
which, a moment before, had flattered,
the next moment, forgets them.</P>
<P>God is never mi&s;taken in the character
of his &s;ervants; for he <HI>&s;eeth their hearts,
and judgeth according to the truth.</HI> But
the world is often deceived in tho&s;e who
court its favour; and, of cour&s;e, is unju&s;t
in the di&s;tribution of its rewards. Flattery
gains the ear of power. Fraud &s;upplants
innocence; and the pretending and a&s;|&s;uming,
occupy the place of the worthy
and the mode&s;t. In vain you claim any
merit with the world, on account of your
<PB N="447" REF="456">
good intentions. The world, knows them
not; regards them not. It judges of you,
&s;olely by your actions; and, what is
wor&s;e, by the &s;ucce&s;s of your actions,
which often depends not on your&s;elves.
But, in the &s;ight of the Supreme Being,
good intentions &s;upply the place of good,
deeds, which you had not the opportu|nity
of performing. The well-meant en|deavours
of the poor, find the &s;ame ac|ceptance
with him, as the generous ac|tions
of the rich. The <HI>widow's mite</HI> is,
in his eye, a co&s;tly offering; and even he
<HI>who giveth to a di&s;ciple a cup of cold water,</HI>
when he can give him no more, <HI>goeth not
without his reward.</HI></P>
<P>As the world is unju&s;t in its judgments,
&s;o it is ungrateful in its requitals. Time
&s;peedily effaces the memory of the greate&s;t
&s;ervices; and when we can repeat them
no more, we are neglected, and thrown
a&s;ide. It was the &s;aying of a noted great
man of the world, on the fall of his
fortunes, &startq;Had I &s;erved God, as faith|fully
as I have done my King, he
<PB N="448" REF="457">
would not have ca&s;t me off in my old
age Unfaithfuln&endq;&s;s, and ingratitude,
are unknown to God. With him, no
new favourites ari&s;e, to u&s;urp the place, or
to bear off the rewards of his antient &s;er|vants.
<HI>Even to your old age, I am He; and
even to hoary hairs, I will carry you. I have
made, and I will bear; even I will carry,
and will deliver you, &s;aith the Lord Al|mighty</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="marg">I&s;a. xlvi. 4.</NOTE>.
&mdash;Since, then, in our &s;everal de|partments,
we mu&s;t labour, What com|pari&s;on
is there, between labouring for
God, and for the world? How unju&s;t are
they, who weary &s;o much &s;ooner in the
&s;ervice of God, than they do in that of the
mo&s;t &s;evere, and imperious of all ma&s;ters!</P>
<P>III. THE re&s;ources of virtue, are much
greater, than tho&s;e of the world; the com|pen&s;ations
which it makes for our di&s;tre&s;|&s;es,
far more valuable. Perpetual &s;ucce&s;s
belongs neither to the one, nor the other.
But under di&s;appointments, when they
occur, virtue bears us up; the world al|lows
us to &s;ink. When the mind of a
<PB N="449" REF="458">
good man is hurt by misfortunes, reli|gion
admini&s;ters the cordial, and infu&s;es
the balm. Whereas, the world inflicts
wounds,, and then leaves them to fe&s;ter.
It brings &s;orrows, but it provides no con|&s;olation.
Con&s;olation is entirely the pro|vince
of religion. Suppo&s;ing religion to
be inferiour to vice in external advan|tages,
it mu&s;t be allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s inter|nal
peace, in a much higher degree. This
is &s;o certain, that almo&s;t all men, at &s;ome
period or other of their life, look forward
to it, as to a de&s;irable retreat. When the
ends of their pre&s;ent pur&s;uit &s;hall be
accompli&s;hed, they propo&s;e to them&s;elves
much &s;atisfaction in an honourable di&s;|charge
of the duties of their &s;tation,
amid&s;t tho&s;e moderate pa&s;&s;ions, and tem|perate
plea&s;ures, which innocence allows.
That which all men agree in holding to
be &s;econd in importance to the pur&s;uit
which they follow, may be &s;afely e&s;teem|ed
to be the fir&s;t in real worth; and it
may be concluded, that if they were not
<PB N="450" REF="459">
blinded by &s;ome prevailing; pa&s;&s;ion, they
would di&s;cern and adopt it as &s;uch.</P>
<P>It is the peculiar effect of virtue, to
make a man's chief happine&s;s ari&s;e from
him&s;elf, and his own conduct. A bad
man is wholly the creature of the world.
He hangs upon its favour, lives by its
&s;miles, and is happy or mi&s;erable, in pro|portion
to his &s;ucce&s;s. But to a virtuous
man, &s;ucce&s;s in worldly undertakings i$
but a &s;econdary object. To di&s;charge his
own part with integrity and honour, is
his chief aim. If he has done properly
what was incumbent on him to do, his
mind is at re&s;t; to Providence he leaves
the event. <HI>His witne&s;s is in heaven, and
his record is on high.</HI> Satisfied with the
approbation of God, and the te&s;timony
of a good con&s;cience, he enjoys him&s;elf,
and de&s;pi&s;es the triumphs of guilt. In
proportion as &s;uch manly principles rule
your heart, you will become independent
of the world; and will forbear complain|ing
of idli&s;couragements. It is the im|perfection
of your virtue, which occa&s;ions
<PB N="451" REF="460">
you to <HI>weary in well-doing.</HI> It is becau&s;e
your hearts remain divided between God
and the world, that you are &s;o often di&s;|contented;
partly wi&s;hing to di&s;charge
your duty, and partly &s;eeking your happi|ne&s;s
from &s;omewhat that is repugnant to
your duty. Study to be more con&s;i&s;tent in
principle, and more uniform in practice,
and your peace will be more unbroken.</P>
<P>Though virtue may appear at fir&s;t &s;ight
to contract the bounds of enjoyment, you
will find, upon reflection, that, in truth, it
enlarges them. If it re&s;trains the exce&s;s
of &s;ome plea&s;ures, it favours and increa&s;es
others. It precludes you from none, but
&s;uch as are either fanta&s;tick and ima|ginary,
or pernicious and de&s;tructive.
Whatever is truly valuable in human en|joyment,
it allows to a good man, no le&s;s
than to others. It not only allows him
&s;uch plea&s;ures, but heightens them, by
that grateful reli&s;h which a good con|&s;cience
gives to every plea&s;ure. It not
only heightens them, but adds to them
al&s;o the peculiar &s;atisfactions which flow
<PB N="452" REF="461">
from virtuous &s;entiments, from devour
affections, and religious hopes. On how
much wor&s;e terms is the &s;inner placed,
in the mid&s;t of his boa&s;ted gratifications?
His portion is confined to this world.
His good things are all of one &s;ort only;
he has neither knowledge, nor reli&s;h, of
any thing beyond them. His enjoyment,
therefore, re&s;ts on a much narrower ba&s;is,
than that of the &s;ervants of God. En|large,
as much as you plea&s;e, the circle of
worldly gratifications; yet, if nothing of
the mind and the heart, nothing of a re|fined
and moral nature, enter into that
circle, and vary the enjoyment, languor
and wearine&s;s &s;oon &s;ucceed. Among
whom do you hear more peevi&s;h expre&s;|&s;ions
of di&s;content, or more frequent
complaints of low &s;pirits, than among
the profe&s;&s;ed votaries of worldly plea&s;ure?</P>
<P>Vice and virtue, in their progre&s;s, as in
every other re&s;pect, hold an oppo&s;ite
cour&s;e. The beginnings of vice are en|ticing.
The fir&s;t &s;teps of worldly ad|vancement,
are flattering and plea&s;ing.
<PB N="453" REF="462">
But the continuance of &s;ucce&s;s, blunts
enjoyment, and flattens de&s;ire. Whereas,
the beginnings of virtue are laborious.
But, by per&s;everance its labours dimi|ni&s;h,
and its plea&s;ures increa&s;e. As it
ripens into confirmed habit, it becomes
both &s;moother in practice, and more com|plete
in its reward. In a worldly life, the
termination of our hopes always meets our
view. We &s;ee a boundary before us, be|yond
which we cannot reach. But the
pro&s;pects of virtue, are growing, and
endle&s;s. <HI>The righteous &s;hall hold on in his
way; and he that hath clean hands, &s;hall
wax &s;tronger and &s;tronger. The path of the
ju&s;t is as the &s;hining light, that &s;hineth
more and more unto the perfect day.</HI> This
brings me to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>IV. THE a&s;&s;ured hope, which good
men enjoy, of a full reward at la&s;t. I
have endeavoured, by &s;everal con&s;idera|tions,
to correct your impatience under
the pre&s;ent di&s;couragements of virtue.
I have &s;hown many high advantages,
<PB N="454" REF="463">
which it already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. But now,
laying all the&s;e a&s;ide; &s;uppo&s;ing virtue to
have brought you no advantage, but to
have only engaged you in perpetual
&s;truggles with an evil world; the Text
&s;ugge&s;ts what is &s;ufficient to an&s;wer eve|ry
objection, and to &s;ilence every com|plaint;
<HI>in due &s;ea&s;on you &s;hall reap, if
you faint not.</HI> It is not a loo&s;e encourage|ment,
or a dubious hope, which is held
forth to us. A direct and explicit decla|ration
is made by the Spirit of God, that
piety and virtue, how di&s;couraged &s;oever,
or oppre&s;&s;ed, they may be for a while,
&s;hall not be fru&s;trated of their reward;
but, that <HI>in due &s;ea&s;on,</HI> when the period
which is fixed by the Divine decree &s;hall
come, all who <HI>weary not in well-doing,</HI>
though they may <HI>have &s;own in tears, &s;hall
reap in joy.</HI> As this great principle of
faith, is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to our pre&s;ent argu|ment,
and is indeed the foundation of
all religion, it will be proper that we
now take a view of the grounds on which
<PB N="455" REF="464">
it re&s;ts. By fixing our attention, both
on the proofs which, rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ts, and
the di&s;coveries which revelation has made,
of a &s;tate of future rewards, we &s;hall take
an effectual method of confirming our
adherence to religion; and of baffling
tho&s;e temptations which might lead us
to <HI>weary in well-doing.</HI></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t, and mo&s;t obvious pre&s; mp|tion,
which rea&s;on affords in behalf of
future rewards to the righteous, ari&s;es
from the imperfect di&s;tribution of good
and evil in our pre&s;ent &s;tate. Notwith|&s;tanding
what I have advanced con|cerning
the plea&s;ures and advantages of
virtue, it cannot be denied, that the hap|pine&s;s
of good men is often left incom|plete.
The vitious po&s;&s;e&s;s advantages, to
which they have no right; while the
con&s;cientious &s;uffer for the &s;ake of virtue,
and groan under di&s;tre&s;&s;es which they
have not merited from the world. In|deed,
were the di&s;tribution of good and
evil, in this life, altogether promi&s;cuous;
<PB N="456" REF="465">
could it be &s;aid, with truth, that the
moral condition of men had no influence
whatever upon their happine&s;s or mi&s;ery;
I admit, that from &s;uch a &s;tate of things,
no pre&s;umption would ari&s;e, of any future
retribution being intended. They who
delight to aggravate the mi&s;eries of life,
and the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of virtue, do no &s;ervice
to the argument in behalf of Providence.
For, if total di&s;order be found to prevail
now, &s;u&s;picions may, too ju&s;tly, ari&s;e, of
its prevailing for ever. If he who rules
the univer&s;e, entirely neglects virtue here,
the probability mu&s;t be &s;mall, of his re|warding
it hereafter. But this is far
from being the true &s;tate of the fact.
What human life pre&s;ents to the view
of an impartial ob&s;erver, is by no means
a &s;cene of entire confu&s;ion; but a &s;tate of
order, begun, and carried on a certain
length. Virtue is &s;o far from being ne|glected
by the Governour of the world,
that from many evident marks, it ap|pears
to be a chief object of his care.
In the con&s;titution of human nature, a
<PB N="457" REF="466">
foundation is laid, for comfort to the
righteous, and for internal puni&s;hment to
the wicked. Throughout the cour&s;e of
the Divine government, tendencies to|wards
the happine&s;s of the one, and the
mi&s;ery of the other, con&s;tantly appear.
They are &s;o con&s;picuous, as not to have
e&s;caped the notice of the rude&s;t nations.
Over the whole earth, they have diffu&s;ed
the belief, that Providence is propitious
to virtue, and adver&s;e to guilt. Yet the&s;e
tendencies are, &s;ometimes, di&s;appointed
of their effect; and that which Provi|dence
vi&s;ibly favours, is left, at pre&s;ent,
without an adequate reward.</P>
<P>From &s;uch an imperfect di&s;tribution of
happine&s;s, what are we to conclude, but
that this &s;y&s;tem is the beginning, not the
whole of things; the opening only of a
more exten&s;ive plan, who&s;e con&s;umma|tion
reaches into a future world? If God
has already <HI>&s;et his throne for judgement:</HI>
if he has vi&s;ibly begun to reward and
to puni&s;h, in &s;ome degree, on earth, he
cannot mean to leave the exerci&s;e of go|vernment
<PB N="458" REF="467">
incomplete. Having laid the
foundation of a great and noble &s;truc|ture,
he will in due time rear it up to
perfection. The unfini&s;hed parts of the
fabrick, evidently &s;how, that a future
building is intended. All his other works
are con&s;tructed according to the mo&s;t full
and exact proportion. In the natural
world, nothing is deficient, nothing re|dundant.
It is in the moral world, only,
that we di&s;cover irregularity and defect.
It falls &s;hort of that order and perfection
which appear in the re&s;t of the creation.
It exhibits not, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, the
&s;ame features of complete wi&s;dom, ju&s;|tice,
or goodne&s;s. But can we believe,
that under the government of the Supreme
Being, tho&s;e apparent di&s;orders &s;hall not
be rectified at the la&s;t? Or, that from
his conduct towards his rational creatures,
the chief of his works, the &s;ole objec|tion
again&s;t his perfection &s;hall ri&s;e, and
be allowed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t for ever?</P>
<P>On the &s;uppo&s;ition of future rewards
and puni&s;hments, a &s;atisfying account
<PB N="459" REF="468">
can be given, of all the di&s;orders which
at pre&s;ent take place on earth. Chri&s;tia|nity
explains their origin, and traces
them to their i&s;&s;ue. Man, fallen from
his primaeval felicity, is now undergoing
probation and di&s;cipline for his final
&s;tate. Divine ju&s;tice remains, for a &s;ea|&s;on,
concealed; and allows men to act
their parts with freedom on this theatre,
that their characters may be formed and
a&s;certained. Amid&s;t di&s;couragements and
afflictions, the righteous give proof of
their fidelity, and acquire the habits of
virtue. But, if you &s;uppo&s;e the events
of this life to have no reference to an|other,
the whole &s;tate of man becomes,
not only inexplicable, but contradictory,
and incon&s;i&s;tent. The powers of the in|feriour
animals, are perfectly &s;uited to their
&s;tation. They know nothing higher than
their pre&s;ent condition. In gratifying
their appetites, they fulfill their de&s;tiny,
and pa&s;s away. Man, alone, comes forth
to act a part, which carries no meaning,
and tends to no end. Endowed with ca|pacities,
<PB N="460" REF="469">
which extend far beyond his
pre&s;ent &s;phere; fitted by his rational na|ture,
for running the race of immorta|lity,
he is &s;topped &s;hort in the very en|trance
of his cour&s;e. He &s;quanders his
activity on pur&s;uits, which he di&s;cerns to
be vain. He langui&s;hes for knowledge,
which is placed beyond his reach. He
thir&s;ts after a happine&s;s, which he is
doomed never to enjoy. He &s;ees, and
laments, the di&s;a&s;ters of his &s;tate; and
yet, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, can find no|thing
to remedy them.&mdash;Has the eternal
God any plea&s;ure in &s;porting him&s;elf
with &s;uch a &s;cene of mi&s;ery and folly, as
this life, if it had no connexion with an|other,
mu&s;t exhibit to his eye? Did he
call into exi&s;tence this magnificent uni|ver&s;e,
adorn it with &s;o much beauty and
&s;plendour, and &s;urround it with tho&s;e
glorious luminaries which we behold in
the heavens, only that &s;ome generations of
mortal men might ari&s;e to behold the&s;e
wonders, and then di&s;appear for ever?
How un&s;uitable, in this ca&s;e, were the
<PB N="461" REF="470">
habitation to the wretched inhabitant?
How incon&s;i&s;tent the commencement of
his being, and the mighty preparation of
his powers and faculties, with his de&s;pi|cable
end? How contradictory, in fine,
were every thing which concerns the
&s;tate of man, to the wi&s;dom and perfec|tion
of his Maker?</P>
<P>Throughout all ages, and among all
nations, the per&s;ua&s;ion of a future life
has prevailed. It &s;prung not from the
refinements of &s;cience, or the &s;pecula|tions
of philo&s;ophy; but from a deeper
and &s;tronger root, the natural &s;entiments
of the human heart. Hence it is common
to the philo&s;opher, and the &s;avage; and is
found in the mo&s;t barbarous, as well as
in the mo&s;t civilized, regions. Even the
belief of the being of a God, is not more
general on the earth, than the belief of
immortality. Dark indeed, and confu&s;ed,
were the notions which men entertained
concerning a future &s;tate. Yet &s;till, in
that &s;tate, they looked for retribution,
both to the good, and the bad; and in
<PB N="462" REF="471">
the perfection of &s;uch plea&s;ures, as they
knew be&s;t, and valued mo&s;t highly, they
placed the rewards of the virtuous. So
univer&s;al a con&s;ent &s;eems plainly to in|dicate,
an original determination given
to the &s;oul by its Creator. It &s;hows this
great truth, to be native and congenial
to man.</P>
<P>When we look into our own brea&s;ts,
we find various anticipations and pre|&s;ages
of future exi&s;tence. Mo&s;t of our
great and high pa&s;&s;ions, extend beyond
the limits of this life. The ambitious and
the &s;elf-denied, the great, the good, and
the wicked, all take intere&s;t, in what is
to happen after they &s;hall have left the
earth. That pa&s;&s;ion for fame, which in|&s;pires
&s;o much of the activity of mankind,
plainly is animated by the per&s;ua&s;ion,
that con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s is to &s;urvive the di&s;|&s;olution
of the body. The virtuous are
&s;upported by the hope, the guilty tor|mented
with the dread, of what is to take
place after death. As death approaches,
the hopes of the one, and the fears of the
<PB N="463" REF="472">
other, are found to redouble. The &s;oul,
when i&s;&s;uing hence, &s;eems more clearly
to di&s;cern its future abode. All the
operations of con&s;cience, proceed upon
the belief of immortality. The whole
moral conduct of men refers to it. All
legi&s;lators have &s;uppo&s;ed it. All religions
are built upon it. It is &s;o e&s;&s;ential to
the order of &s;ociety, that were it era&s;|ed,
human laws would prove ineffectual
re&s;traints from evil, and a deluge of
crimes and mi&s;eries would overflow the
the earth. To &s;uppo&s;e this univer&s;al and
powerful belief to be without foundation
in truth, is to &s;uppo&s;e, that a principle
of delu&s;ion was interwoven with the
nature of man; is to &s;uppo&s;e, that his
Creator was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of
impre&s;&s;ing his heart with a fal&s;ehood, in
order to make him an&s;wer die purpo&s;es of
his being.</P>
<P>BUT though the&s;e arguments be &s;trong,
yet all argum$nts are liable to objection.
Perhaps this general belief, of which I have
<PB N="464" REF="473">
&s;poken, has been owing to inclination
and de&s;ire, more than to evidence. Per|haps,
in our rea&s;onings on this &s;ubject
from the Divine perfections, we flatter
our&s;elves with being of more con&s;e|quence
than we truly are, in the &s;y&s;tem
of the univer&s;e. Hence the great impor|tance
of a di&s;covery proceeding from
God him&s;elf, which gives full authority
to all that rea&s;on had &s;uggested, and
places this capital truth beyond the reach
of &s;u&s;picion or di&s;tru&s;t.</P>
<P>The method which Chri&s;tianity has
taken, to convey to us the evidence of a
future &s;tate, highly de&s;erves our atten|tion.
Had the Go&s;pel been addre&s;&s;ed, like
a &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy, &s;olely to the un|der&s;tanding
of men; had it aimed only at
enlightening the &s;tudious and reflecting,
it would have confined it&s;elf to ab&s;tract
truth; it would have &s;imply informed us,
that the righteous are hereafter to be re|warded,
and &s;inners to be puni&s;hed. Such
a declaration as that contained in the
Text, would have been &s;ufficient: <HI>Be not
<PB N="465" REF="474">
weary in well-doing; for in due &s;ea&s;on you
&s;hall reap, if you &s;aint not.</HI> But the Go&s;|pel
has not &s;topped, at barely announcing
life and immortality to mankind. It was
calculated for popular edification. It was
intended to be the religion, not merely of
the few, who&s;e under&s;tanding was to be
informed; but of the many, al&s;o, who&s;e
imagination was to be impre&s;&s;ed, and
who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were to be awakened, in
order to give the truth its due influence
over them. Upon this account, it not
only reveals the certainty of a future
&s;tate, but, in the per&s;on of the great
Founder of our religion, exhibits a &s;eries
of facts relating to it; by means of which,
our &s;en&s;es, our imagination, and pa&s;&s;ions,
all become intere&s;ted in this great object.</P>
<P>The re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t from the
grave, was de&s;igned to be a &s;en&s;ible evi|dence,
that death infers not a final ex|tinction
of the living principle. He ro&s;e,
in order to &s;how, that, in our name, he
had conquered death, and was <HI>become the
fir&s;t fruits of them that &s;leep.</HI> Nor did he
<PB N="466" REF="475">
only ri&s;e from the grave, but, by a&s;cend|ing
to heaven in a vi&s;ible form, before
many witne&s;&s;es, gave an ocular &s;peci|men
of the tran&s;ition, from this world,
into the region of the ble&s;&s;ed. The em|ployments
which now occupy him there,
are fully declared. <HI>As our fore-runner,
he hath entered within the veil. He ap|pears
in the pre&s;ence of God for us. He
maketh perpetual interce&s;&s;ion for his peo|ple.
I go,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to my Father and your
father, to my God and your God. In my
Father's hou&s;e are many man&s;ions. I go to
prepare a place for you. I will come again,
and receive you to my&s;elf, that where I am,
there ye may be al&s;o.</HI> The circum&s;tances
of his coming again, are di&s;tinctly fore|told.
The &s;ounding of the la&s;t trumpet,
the re&s;urrection of the dead, the appear|ance
of the Judge, and the &s;olemnity
with which he &s;hall di&s;criminate the good
from the bad, are all de&s;cribed. The very
words in which he &s;hall pronounce the
final &s;entence, are recited in our hearing:
<HI>Come, ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father! inherit the
<PB N="467" REF="476">
kingdom prepared for you, from the founda|tion
of the world.</HI> Then &s;hall the holy and
the ju&s;t be <HI>caught up in the clouds, to meet
the Lord in the air.</HI> They &s;hall enter with
him into the <HI>city of the living God.</HI> They
&s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s the new earth, and new hea|vens,
wherein dwelleth righteou&s;ne&s;s. God
&s;hall wipe away all tears front their eyes.
They &s;hall behold his face in righteou&s;ne&s;s,
and be &s;ati&s;fied with his likene&s;&s; for ever.&mdash;By
recording &s;uch a train of &s;triking cir|cum&s;tances
and facts, the Go&s;pel fami|liarizes
us in &s;ome mea&s;ure with a future
&s;tate. By accommodating this great di&s;|covery,
in &s;o u&s;eful a manner, to the
conceptions of men, it furni&s;hes a &s;trong
intrin&s;ick evidence of its divine origin.</P>
<P>THUS, upon the whole, whether you
con&s;ult your rea&s;on, or li&s;ten to the di&s;|coveries
of revelation, you behold our ar|gument
confirmed; you behold a life of
piety and virtue, i&s;&s;uing in immortal fe|licity.
Of what worldly pur&s;uit can it be
pronounced, that its reward is certain?
<PB N="468" REF="477">
Look every where around you, and you
&s;hall &s;ee, that <HI>the race is</HI> far from being
<HI>always to the &s;wift, or the battle to the
&s;trong.</HI> The mo&s;t diligent, the mo&s;t wi&s;e,
the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed, may, after all
their labours, be di&s;appointed in the end;
and be left to &s;uffer the regret, of having
<HI>&s;pent their &s;trength for nought.</HI> But, for
the righteous, is <HI>laid up the crown of life.</HI>
Their final happine&s;s is prepared in the
eternal plan of Providence, and &s;ecured
by the labours and &s;ufferings of the
Saviour of the world.</P>
<P>Cea&s;e, then, from your unju&s;t com|plaints
again&s;t virtue and religion. Leave
di&s;content, and peevi&s;hne&s;s, to worldly
men. In no period of di&s;tre&s;s, in no mo|ment
of di&s;appointment, allow your&s;elves
to &s;u&s;pect, that piety and integrity are
fruitle&s;s. In every &s;tate of being, they
lead to happine&s;s. If you enjoy not
at pre&s;ent their full rewards, it is, becau&s;e
the &s;ea&s;on of recompence is not yet come.
For, <HI>in due &s;ea&s;on, you &s;hall reap.</HI> There is
a time which is proper for reward; and
<PB N="469" REF="478">
there is a period which belongs to trial.
How long the one &s;hould la&s;t, and when
the other &s;hould arrive, belongs not to
you to determine. It is fixed by the
