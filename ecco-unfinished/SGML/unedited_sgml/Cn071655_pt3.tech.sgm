<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PROVERBS, iv. 8.</BIBL>
<Q>Exalt her, and &s;he &s;hall promote thee; &s;he
&s;hall bring thee to honour.&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE love of honour is one of the
&s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ions in the human
heart.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. I.</NOTE> It &s;hows it&s;elf in our earlie&s;t
years; and is coeval with the fir&s;t exer|tions
or rea&s;on. It accompanies us through
all the &s;tages of &s;ub&s;equent life; and in
private &s;tations di&s;covers it &s;elf no le&s;s than
in the higher ranks of &s;ociety. In their
ideas of what con&s;titutes honour, men
<PB N="2" REF="11">
greatly vary, and often gro&s;sly err. But
of &s;omewhat which they conceive to form
pre-eminence and di&s;tinction, all are de&s;i|rous.
All wi&s;h, by &s;ome means or other,
to acquire re&s;pect from tho&s;e among whom
they live; and to contempt and di&s;grace,
none are in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>Among the advantages which attend reli|gion
and virtue, the honour which they
confer on man is frequently mentioned in
&s;cripture as one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable.
<HI>Wi&s;dom is the principal thing,</HI> &s;ays Solomon
in the pa&s;&s;age where the text lies, <HI>therefore
get wi&s;dom; and with all thy getting, get
under&s;tanding. Exalt her, and &s;he &s;hall pro|mote
thee; &s;he &s;hall bring thee to honour, when
thou do&s;t embrace her. She &s;hall give to thine
head an ornament of grace; a crown of glory
&s;hall &s;he deliver to thee.</HI> It is evident that
throughout all the &s;acred writings, and par|ticularly
in this book of Proverbs, by <HI>wi&s;dom</HI>
is to be under&s;tood a principle of re|ligion
producing virtuous conduct. <HI>The
fear of the Lord</HI> is &s;aid to be <HI>the beginning
of wi&s;dom:</HI> And by this fear of the Lord
<PB N="3" REF="12">
men are &s;aid to <HI>depart from evil; to walk
in the way of good men, and to keep the path
of the righteous</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prov. ii. 20.</NOTE>. Man is then regulated by
the <HI>wi&s;dom which is from above,</HI> when he is
formed by piety to the duties of virtue and
morality; and of the wi&s;dom which pro|duces
this effect, it is a&s;&s;erted in the text,
that it <HI>bringeth us to honour.</HI></P>
<P>On this recommendation of religion it
is the more nece&s;&s;ary to fix our attention,
becau&s;e it is often refu&s;ed to it by men of
the world. Their notions of honour are
apt to run in a very different channel.
Wherever religion is mentioned, they con|nect
with it ideas of melancholy and de|jection,
or of mean and feeble &s;pirits. They
perhaps admit that it may be u&s;eful to the
multitude, as a principle of re&s;traint from
di&s;orders and crimes; and that to per&s;ons
of peculiar turn of mind, it may afford
con&s;olation under the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of life. But
from the active &s;cenes of the world, and
from tho&s;e vigorous exertions which di&s;|play
to advantage the human abilities, they
<PB N="4" REF="13">
incline totally to exclude it. It may &s;ooth
the timid, or the &s;ad: But they con&s;ider it
as having no connection with what is pro|per
to rai&s;e men to honour and di&s;tinction.
I &s;hall now endeavour to remove this re|proach
from religion; and to &s;how that in
every &s;ituation of human life, even in the
highe&s;t &s;tations, it forms the honour, as
well as the happine&s;s of man.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t, let us be careful to a&s;certain
what true religion is. I admit that there
is a certain &s;pecies of religion (if we can
give it that name) which has no claim to
&s;uch high di&s;tinction; when it is placed
wholly in &s;peculation and belief, in the re|gularity
of external homage, or in fiery
zeal about conte&s;ted opinions. From a &s;u|per&s;tition
inherent in the human mind, the
religion of the multitude has always been
tinctured with too much of this &s;pirit.
They &s;erve God as they would &s;erve a
proud ma&s;ter, who may be flattered by
their pro&s;trations, appea&s;ed by their gifts,
and gained by loud prote&s;tations of attach|ment
to his intere&s;ts, and of enmity to all
<PB N="5" REF="14">
whom they &s;uppo&s;e to be his foes. But
this is not that <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> to which Solomon
a&s;cribes, in the text, &s;uch high preroga|tives.
It is not the religion which we
preach, nor the religion of Chri&s;t. That
religion con&s;i&s;ts in the love of God and
the love of man, grounded on faith in the
Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the great Redeemer of
the world, the Interce&s;&s;or for the penitent,
and the Patron of the virtuous; through
whom we enjoy comfortable acce&s;s to the
Sovereign of the univer&s;e in the acts of
wor&s;hip and devotion. It con&s;i&s;ts in ju|&s;tice,
humanity, and mercy; in a fair and
candid mind, a generous and affectionate
heart; accompanied with temperance, &s;elf|government,
and a perpetual regard in all
our actions to con&s;cience, and to the law
of God. A religious, and a thoroughly
virtuous character, therefore, I con&s;ider as
the &s;ame.</P>
<P>By the true honour of man is to be un|der&s;tood,
not what merely commands ex|ternal
re&s;pect, but what commands the re|&s;pect
<PB N="6" REF="15">
of the heart; what rai&s;es one to ac|knowledged
eminence above others of the
&s;ame &s;pecies; what always creates e&s;teem,
and in its highe&s;t degree, produces vene|ration.
The que&s;tion now before us is,
from what cau&s;e this eminence ari&s;es? By
what means is it to be attained?</P>
<P>I SAY, fir&s;t, from riches it does not ari&s;e.
The&s;e, we all know, may belong to the
vile&s;t of mankind. Providence has &s;catter|ed
them among the crowd with an undi&s;|tingui&s;hing
hand, as of purpo&s;e to &s;how of
what &s;mall account they are in the &s;ight
of God. Experience every day proves that
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them is con&s;i&s;tent with
the mo&s;t general contempt. On this point
therefore I conceive it not nece&s;&s;ary to in|&s;i&s;t
any longer.</P>
<P>NEITHER does the honour of man ari&s;e
from mere dignity of rank or office. Were
&s;uch di&s;tinctions always, or even generally,
obtained in con&s;equence of uncommon me|rit,
they would indeed confer honour on
the character. But, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of
<PB N="7" REF="16">
&s;ociety, is too well known that this is
not the ca&s;e. They are often the co&s;e|quence
of birth alone. They are &s;ome|times
the fruit of mere dependence and
a&s;&s;iduity. They may be the recompence
of flattery, ver&s;atility, and intrigue; and
&s;o be conjoined with meanne&s;s and ba&s;e|ne&s;s
of character. To per&s;ons graced with
noble birth, or placed in high &s;tations,
much external honour is due. This is
what the &s;ubordination of &s;ociety nece&s;&s;a|rily
requires; and what every good mem|ber
of it will chearfully yield. But how
often has it happened that &s;uch per&s;ons,
when externally re&s;pected, are, neverthe|le&s;s,
de&s;pi&s;ed by men in their hearts; nay,
&s;ometimes execrated by the public? Their
elevation, if they have been unworthy of
it, is &s;o far from procuring them true ho|nour,
that it only renders their in&s;ignifi|cance,
perhaps their infamy, more con&s;pi|cuous.
By drawing attention to their con|duct,
it di&s;covers in the mo&s;t glaring light
how little they de&s;erved the &s;tation which
they po&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="17">
I MUST next ob&s;erve, that the proper ho|nour
of man ari&s;es not from &s;ome of tho&s;e
&s;plendid actions and abilities which excite
high admiration. Courage and prowe&s;s,
military renown, &s;ignal victories and con|que&s;ts,
may render the name of a man fa|mous,
without rendering his character tru|ly
honourable. To many brave men, to
many heroes renowned in &s;tory, we look
up with wonder. Their exploits are re|corded.
Their prai&s;es are &s;ung. They &s;tand
as on an eminence above the re&s;t of man|kind.
Their eminence, neverthele&s;s, may
not be of that &s;ort before which we bow
with inward e&s;teem and re&s;pect. Some|thing
more is wanted for that purpo&s;e, than
the conquering arm, and the intrepid mind.
The laurels of the warrior mu&s;t at all times
be dyed in blood, and bedewed with the
tears of the widow and the orphan. But
if they have been &s;tained by rapine and in|humanity;
if &s;ordid avarice has marked his
character; or low and gro&s;s &s;en&s;uality has
degraded his life; the great hero &s;inks into
a little man. What at a di&s;tance, or on a
<PB N="9" REF="18">
&s;uperficial view, we admired, becomes mean,
perhaps odious, when we examine it more
clo&s;ely. It is like the Colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue, who&s;e
immen&s;e &s;ize &s;truck the &s;pectator afar off
with a&s;toni&s;hment; but when nearly view|ed,
it appears di&s;proportioned, un&s;hapely,
and rude.</P>
<P>Ob&s;ervations of the &s;ame kind may be
applied to all the reputation derived from
civil accompli&s;hments; from the refined
politics of the &s;tate&s;man; or the literary
efforts of genius and erudition. The&s;e be|&s;tow,
and, within certain bounds, ought
to be&s;tow, eminence and di&s;tinction on
men. They di&s;cover talents which in them|&s;elves
are &s;hining; and which become high|ly
valuable, when employed in advancing
the good of mankind. Hence, they fre|quently
give ri&s;e to fame. But a di&s;tinc|tion
is to be made between fame and true
honour. The former is a loud and noi&s;y
applau&s;e: The latter, a more &s;ilent and in|ternal
homage. Fame floats on the breath
of the multitude: Honour re&s;ts on the
judgement of the thinking. Fame may
<PB N="10" REF="19">
give prai&s;e while it with-holds e&s;teem:
True honour implies e&s;teem mingled with
re&s;pect. The one regards particular di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
talents: the other looks up to the
whole character. Hence the &s;tate&s;man, the
orator, or the poet, may be famous; while
yet the man him&s;elf is far from being ho|noured.
We envy his abilities. We wi&s;h
to rival them. But we would not chu&s;e to
be cla&s;&s;ed with him who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them.
In&s;tances of this &s;ort are too often found in
every record of ancient or modern hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>FROM all this it follows, that in order to
di&s;cern where man's true honour lies, we
mu&s;t look, not to any adventitious circum|&s;tance
of fortune; not to any &s;ingle &s;parkling
quality; but to the whole of what forms
a man; what intitles him, as &s;uch, to rank
high among that cla&s;s of beings to which
he belongs; in word, we mu&s;t look to
the mind and the &s;oul.&mdash;A mind &s;uperior
to fear, to &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;t and corruption;
a mind governed by the principles of uni|form
rectitude and integrity; the &s;ame in
<PB N="11" REF="20">
pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity; which no bribe
can &s;educe, nor terror overawe: neither by
plea&s;ure melted into effeminancy, nor by
di&s;tre&s;s &s;unk into dejection; &s;uch is the
mind which forms the di&s;tinction and emi|nence
of man.&mdash;One, who in no &s;itua|tion
of life is either a&s;hamed or afraid of
di&s;charging his duty, and acting his proper
part with firmne&s;s and con&s;tancy; true to
the God whom he wor&s;hips, and true to
the faith in which he profe&s;&s;es to believe;
full of affection to his brethren of man|kind;
faithful to his friends, generous to
his enemies, warm with compa&s;&s;ion to the
unfortunate; &s;elf-denying to little private
intere&s;ts and plea&s;ures, but zealous for pub|lic
intere&s;t and happine&s;s; magnanimous,
without being proud; humble, without be|ing
mean; ju&s;t, without being har&s;h; &s;im|ple
in his manners, but manly in his feel|ings;
on who&s;e word you can entirely re|ly;
who&s;e countenance never deceives you;
who&s;e profe&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s are the effu|&s;ions
of his heart: one, in fine, whom in|dependent
of any views of advantage, you
<PB N="12" REF="21">
would chu&s;e for a &s;uperior, could tru&s;t in
as a friend, and could love as a brother:
&mdash;This is the man, whom in your heart,
above all others, you do, you mu&s;t, ho|nour.</P>
<P>SUCH a character, imperfectly as it has
now been drawn, all mu&s;t acknowledge to
be formed &s;olely by the influence of &s;teady
religion and virtue. it is the effect of prin|ciples
which, operating on con&s;cience, de|termine
it uniformly to pur&s;ue <HI>what&s;oever
things are true, what&s;oever things are hone&s;t,
what&s;oever things are ju&s;t, what&s;oever things
are pure, what&s;oever things are lovely, what|&s;oever
things are of good report, if there be
any virtue, and if there be any prai&s;e.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Philip. iv. 8.</NOTE> By
the&s;e means, <HI>wi&s;dom,</HI> as the text a&s;&s;erts,
<HI>bringeth us to honour.</HI></P>
<P>In confirmation of this doctrine it is to
be ob&s;erved, that the honour which man
acquires by religion and virtue is more in|dependent,
and more complete, than what
<PB N="13" REF="22">
can be acquired by any other means. It is
independent of any thing foreign or exter|nal.
It is not partial, but entire re&s;pect,
which it procures. Wherever fortune is
concerned, it is the &s;tation or rank which
commands our deference. Where &s;ome &s;hi|ning
quality attracts admiration, it is only
to a part of the character that we pay ho|mage.
But when a per&s;on is di&s;tingui&s;hed
for eminent worth and goodne&s;s, it is the
man, the whole man, whom we re&s;pect.
The honour which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es is intrin&s;ic.
Place him in any &s;ituation of life, even an
ob&s;cure one; let room only be given for
his virtues to come forth and &s;how them|&s;elves,
and you will revere him; as a pri|vate
citizen; or as the father of a family.
If in higher life he appear more illu&s;trious,
this is not owing merely to the re&s;pect crea|ted
by rank. It is, becau&s;e there a nobler
&s;phere of action is opened to him; becau&s;e
his virtues are brought forth into more ex|tended
exertion; and placed in &s;uch con|&s;picuous
view, that he appears to grace
and adorn the &s;tation which he fills. Even
<PB N="14" REF="23">
in the &s;ilence of retirement, or in the re|treat
of old age, &s;uch a man &s;inks not in|to
forgotten ob&s;curity. His remembered
virtues continue to be honoured, when their
active exertions are over; and to the la&s;t
&s;tage of life he is followed by public e&s;teem
and re&s;pect. Whereas, if genuine worth
be wanting, the applau&s;e which may have
attended a man for a while, by degrees dies
away. Though, for a part of his life, he
had dazzled the world, this was owing to
his deficiency in the e&s;&s;entail qualities ha|ving
not been &s;u&s;pected. As &s;oon as the
impo&s;ture is di&s;covered, the falling &s;tar
&s;inks in darkne&s;s.&mdash;There is therefore a
&s;tandard of independent, intrin&s;ic worth,
to which we mu&s;t bring in the end what|ever
claims to be honourable among men.
By this we mu&s;t mea&s;ure it; and it will al|ways
be found, that nothing but what is
e&s;&s;ential to man has power to command the
re&s;pect of man's heart.</P>
<P>IT is to be farther ob&s;erved, that the
univer&s;al con&s;ent of mankind in honouring
<PB N="15" REF="24">
real virtue, is &s;ufficient to &s;how what the
genuine &s;en&s;e of human nature is on this
&s;ubject. All other claims of honour are
ambulatory and changeable. The degrees
of re&s;pect paid to external &s;tations vary with
forms of government, and fa&s;hions of the
times. Qualities which in one country are
highly honoured, in another are lightly
e&s;teemed. Nay, what in &s;ome regions of
the earth di&s;tingui&s;hes a man above others,
might el&s;ewhere expo&s;e him to contempt or
ridicule. But where was ever the nation
on the face of the globe, who did not ho|nour
unblemi&s;hed worth, unaffected piety,
&s;tedfa&s;t, humane, and regular virtue? To
whom were altars erected in the Heathen
world but to tho&s;e who by their merits and
heroic labours, by their invention of u&s;eful
arts, or by &s;ome &s;ignal acts of beneficence
to their country, or to mankind, were
found worthy, in their opinion, to be tran&s;|ferred
from among men, and added to the
number of the gods?&mdash;Even the coun|terfeited
appearances of virtue, which are
&s;o often found in the world, are te&s;timo|nies
<PB N="16" REF="25">
to its prai&s;e. The hypocrite knows
that, without a&s;&s;uming the garb of virtue,
every other advantage he can po&s;&s;e&s;s is in|&s;ufficient
to procure him e&s;teem. Interfe|rence
of intere&s;t, or perverfity of di&s;po&s;i|tion,
may occa&s;ionally lead individuals to
oppo&s;e, even to hate, the upright and the
good. But however the characters of &s;uch
per&s;ons may be mi&s;taken, or mi&s;repre&s;ent|ed,
yet, as far as they are acknowledged to
be virtuous, the profligate dare not traduce
them. Genuine virtue has a language that
&s;peaks to every heart throughout the world.
It is a language which is under&s;tood by all.
In every region, every clime, the homage
paid to it is the &s;ame. In no one &s;enti|ment
were ever mankind more generally a|greed.</P>
<P>FINALLY, the honour acquired by reli|gion
and virtue is honour divine and im|mortal.
It is honour, not in the e&s;tima|tion
of men only, but in the &s;ight of God;
who&s;e judgement is the &s;tandard of truth
and right; who&s;e approbation confers a
<PB N="17" REF="26">
<HI>crown of glory that fadeth not away.</HI> All
the honour we can gain among men is li|mited
and confined. Its circle is narrow.
Its duration is &s;hort and tran&s;itory. But
the honour which is founded on true good|ne&s;s,
accompanies us through the whole
progre&s;s of our exi&s;tence. It enters with
man into a future &s;tate; and continues to
brighten throughout eternal ages. What
procured him re&s;pect on earth, &s;hall ren|der
him e&s;timable among the great a&s;&s;em|bly
of angels, and <HI>&s;pirits of ju&s;t men made
perfect;</HI> where, we are a&s;&s;ured, they who
have been eminent in righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall
<HI>&s;hine as the brightne&s;s of the firmament, and
as the &s;tars fir ever and ever.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Daniel xii. 3.</NOTE>.&mdash;Earthly
honours are both &s;hortlived in their con|tinuance,
and, while they la&s;t, tarni&s;hed
with &s;pots and, &s;tains. On &s;ome quarter
or other, their brightne&s;s is ob&s;cured; their
exaltation is humbled. But the honour
which proceeds from God, and virtue, is
unmixed and pure. It is a lu&s;tre which is
<PB N="18" REF="27">
derived from heaven; and is likened, in
&s;cripture, to <HI>the light of the morning, when
the &s;un ri&s;eth; even a morning without clouds;</HI>
to <HI>the light which &s;hineth more and more unto
the perfect day.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xxiii. 4.; Prov. iv. 18.</NOTE> Whereas the honours
which the world confers re&s;emble the feeble
and twinkling flame of a taper; which is
often clouded by the &s;moke it &s;ends forth;
is always wa&s;ting; and &s;oon dies totally
away.</P>
<P>LET him, therefore, who retains any &s;en&s;e
of human dignity; who feels within him
that de&s;ire of honour which is congenial to
man, a&s;pire to the gratification of this pa&s;|&s;ion
by methods which are worthy of his
nature. Let him not re&s;t on any of tho&s;e
external di&s;tinctions which vanity has con|trived
to introduce. The&s;e can procure
him no more than the &s;emblance of re|&s;pect.
Let him not be flattered by the ap|plau&s;e
which &s;ome occa&s;ional di&s;play of a|bilities
may have gained him. That ap|plau&s;e
<PB N="19" REF="28">
may be mingled with contempt.
Let him look to what will dignify his
character as a man. Let him cultivate
tho&s;e moral qualities which all men in
their hearts re&s;pect. <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> &s;hall then <HI>give
to his head an ornament of grace; a crown
of glory &s;hall &s;he deliver to him.</HI> This is an
honour to which all may a&s;pire. It is a
prize, for which every one, whether of
high or low rank, may contend. It is al|ways
in his power &s;o to di&s;tingui&s;h, him|&s;elf
by worthy and virtuous conduct, as to
command the re&s;pect of tho&s;e around him;
and, what is highe&s;t of all, to obtain prai&s;e
and honour from God.</P>
<P>LET non one imagine that in the reli|gious
part of this character there is any
thing which ca&s;ts over it a gloomy &s;hade,
or derogates from that e&s;teem which men
are generally di&s;po&s;ed to yield to exemplary
virtues. Fal&s;e ideas may be entertained of
religion; as fal&s;e and imperfect conceptions
of virtue have often prevailed in the world.
But to true religion there belongs no &s;ul|len
<PB N="20" REF="29">
gloom; no melancholy au&s;terity, tend|ing
to withdraw men from human &s;ociety,
or to dimini&s;h the exertions of active vir|tue.
On the contrary, the religious prin|ciple,
rightly under&s;tood, not only unites
with all &s;uch virtues, but &s;upports, forti|fies,
and confirms them. It is &s;o far from
ob&s;curing the lu&s;tre of a character, that it
heightens and ennobles it. It adds to all
the moral virtues a venerable and autho|ritative
dignity. It renders the virtuous
character more augu&s;t. To the decorations
of a palace, it joins the maje&s;ty of a tem|ple.</P>
<P>He who divides religion from virtue,
under&s;tands neither the one, nor the other.
It is the union of the two which con&s;um|mates
the human character and &s;tate. It
is their union which has di&s;tingui&s;hed tho&s;e
great and illu&s;trious men, who have &s;hone
with &s;o much honour in former ages; and
who&s;e memory lives in the remembrance
of &s;ucceeding generations. It is their u|nion
which forms that <HI>wi&s;dom which is
from above;</HI> that wi&s;dom to which the text
<PB N="21" REF="30">
a&s;cribes &s;uch high effects; and to which
belongs the &s;ublime encomium given of it
by an author of one of the apocryphal
books of Scripture; with who&s;e beautiful
and emphatical expre&s;&s;ions I conclude this
di&s;cour&s;e. The memorial of virtue is immor|tal.
It is known with God, and with men.
When it is pre&s;ent, men take example at it;
and when it is gone, they de&s;ire it. it wear|eth
a crown, and triumpheth for ever; ha|ving
gotten the victory; &s;triving for undefiled
rewards. Wi&s;dom is the breath of the power
of God; and a pure influence flowing from the
glory of the Almighty. Therefore can no de|filed
thing fall into her. She is the bright|ne&s;s
of the everla&s;ting light; the un&s;potted
mirror of the power of God; and the image
of his goodne&s;s. Remaining in her&s;elf, &s;he
maketh all things new; and in all ages, en|tering
into holy &s;ouls, &s;he maketh them friends
of God, and prophets: For God loveth none
but him that dwelleth with wi&s;dom. She is
more beautiful than the &s;un; and above all the

<P>THE amiable &s;pirit of our holy reli|gion
appears in nothing more than in
the care it hath taken to enforce on men
the &s;ocial duties of life.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. II.</NOTE> This is one of the
cleare&s;t characteri&s;tics of its being a reli|gion
who&s;e origin is divine: For every doc|trine
which proceeds from the Father of
mercies will undoubtedly breathe benevo|lence
and humanity. This is the &s;cope of
the two exhortations in the text, <HI>to rejoice
with them that rejoice, and to weep with them
<PB N="23" REF="32">
that weep;</HI> the one calculated to promote
the happine&s;s, the other, to alleviate the
&s;orrows of our fellow-creature; both con|curring
to form that temper which intere&s;ts
us in the concerns of our brethren; which
di&s;po&s;es us to feel along with them, to take
part in their joys, and in their &s;orrows.
This temper is known by the name of Sen|&s;ibility;
a word, which in modern times
we hear in the mouth of every one; a qua|lity,
which every one affects to po&s;&s;e&s;s; in
it&s;elf, a mo&s;t amiable and worthy di&s;po&s;i|tion
of mind; but often mi&s;taken and ab|u&s;ed;
employed as a cover, &s;ometimes, to
capricious humour; &s;ometimes, to &s;elfi&s;h
pa&s;&s;ions. I &s;hall endeavour to explain the
nature of true &s;en&s;ibility. I &s;hall con&s;ider
its effects: and after &s;howing its advanta|ges,
&s;hall point out the abu&s;es, and mi&s;ta|ken
forms of this virtue.</P>
<P>THE original con&s;titution of our nature
with re&s;pect to the mixture of &s;elfi&s;h and
&s;ocial affections, di&s;covers in this, as in eve|ry
other part of our frame, profound and
<PB N="24" REF="33">
admirable wi&s;dom. Each individual is, by
his Creator, committed particularly to him|&s;elf,
and his own car. He has it more in
his power to promote his own welfare, than
any other per&s;on can po&s;&s;ibly have to pro|mote
it. It was therefore fit, it was nece&s;|&s;ary,
that in each individual &s;elf-love &s;hould
be the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t active in&s;tinct.
This &s;elf-love, if he had been a being who
&s;tood &s;olitary and alone, might have pro|ved
&s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e both of his
pre&s;everation, and his welfare. But &s;uch is
not the &s;ituation of man. He is mixed a|mong
multitudes of the &s;ame nature. In
the&s;e multitudes, the &s;elf-love of one man,
or attention to his particular intere&s;t, en|countering
the &s;elf-love and the intere&s;ts of
another, could not but produce frequent
oppo&s;ition, and innumerable mi&s;chiefs. It
was nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to provide a coun|terbalance
to this part of his nature; which
is accordingly done, by implanting in him
tho&s;e &s;ocial and benevolent in&s;tincts which
lead him in &s;ome mea&s;ure out of him&s;elf, to
follow the intere&s;t of others. The &s;trength
<PB N="25" REF="34">
of the&s;e &s;ocial in&s;tincts is, in general, pro|portioned
to their importance in human
life. Hence that degree of &s;en&s;ibility which
prompts us to <HI>weep with them that weep,</HI> is
&s;tronger than that which prompts us to <HI>re|joice
with them that rejoice;</HI> for this rea&s;on,
that the unhappy &s;tand more in need of
our fellow-feeling and a&s;&s;i&s;tance than the
pro&s;perous. Still however it was requi&s;ite,
that in each individual the quantity of &s;elf|love
&s;hould remain in a large proportion,
on account of its importance to the pre&s;er|vation
of his life and well-being. But as the
quantity requi&s;ite for this purpo&s;e is apt both
to ingro&s;s his attention, and to carry him
into criminal exce&s;&s;es, the perfection of his
nature is mea&s;ured by the due counterpoi&s;e
of tho&s;e &s;ocial principles which, tempering
the force of the &s;elfi&s;h affection, render
man equally u&s;eful to him&s;elf, and to tho&s;e
with whom he is joined in &s;ociety. Hence
the u&s;e and the value of that &s;en&s;ibility of
which we now treat.</P>
<P>THAT it con&s;titutes an e&s;&s;ential part of a
<PB N="26" REF="35">
religious character, there can be no doubt.
Not only are the words of the text expre&s;s
to this purpo&s;e, but the whole New Te&s;ta|ment
abounds with pa&s;&s;ages which enjoin
the cultivation of this di&s;po&s;ition. Being
<HI>all one body, and members one of another,</HI> we
are commanded to <HI>love our neighbour as our|&s;elf;
to look every man not on his own things
only, but on tho&s;e of others al&s;o; to be pitif$$d,
to be courteous, to be tender-hearted; to bear
one another's burdens, and &s;o to fulfil the law
of Chri&s;t.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Luke, x. 27.; Philip. ii. 4.; 1 Peter, iii. 8.; Ephe&s;. iv. 23.; Galat. vi. z.</NOTE> The di&s;po&s;itions oppo&s;ite to
&s;en&s;ibility are, cruelty, hardne&s;s of heart,
contracted attachment to worldly intere&s;ts;
which every one will admit to be directly
oppo&s;ite to the Chri&s;tian character. Accor|ding
to the different degrees of con&s;titutio|nal
warmth in men's affections, &s;en&s;ibility
may, even among the virtuous, prevail in
different proportions. For all derive not
from nature the &s;ame happy delicacy, and
tenderne&s;s of feeling. With &s;ome, the heart
<PB N="27" REF="36">
melts, and relents, in kind emotions, much
more ea&s;ily than with others. But with
every one who a&s;pires to the character of a
good man, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the humane
and compa&s;&s;ionate di&s;po&s;itions &s;hould be
found. There mu&s;t be that within him
which &s;hall form him to feel in &s;ome degree
with the heart of a brother; and when he
beholds others enjoying happine&s;s, or &s;ees
them &s;unk in &s;orrow, &s;hall bring his af|fections
to accord, and, if we may &s;peak
&s;o, it found a note uni&s;on to theirs. This
is to <HI>rejoice with them that rejoice, and
to weep with them that weep.</HI> How much
this temper belongs to the perfection of
our nature, we learn from one who exhi|bited
that perfection in its highe&s;t degree.
When our Lord Je&s;us, on a certain occa|&s;ion,
came to the grave of a beloved friend,
and &s;aw his relations mourning around it,
he pre&s;ently caught the impre&s;&s;ion of their
&s;orrow; <HI>he groaned in &s;pirit, and was trou|bled.</HI>
He knew that he was about to re|move
the cau&s;e of their di&s;tre&s;s, by re|calling
Lazarus to life: Yet, in the mo|ment
<PB N="28" REF="37">
of grief, his heart &s;ympathi&s;ed with
theirs; and, together with the weeping
friends, <HI>Je&s;us wept.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">John, ii. 35.</NOTE></P>
<P>LET us next proceed to con&s;ider the ef|fect
of this virtuous &s;en&s;ibility on our cha|racter,
and our &s;tate. I &s;hall con&s;ider it in
two views; its influence on our moral con|duct,
and its influence on our happine&s;s.</P>
<P>FIRST, it powerfully influences the proper
di&s;charge of all the relative and &s;ocial du|ties
of life. Without &s;ome di&s;charge of
tho&s;e duties there could be no comfort or
&s;ecurity in human &s;ociety. Men would
become hordes of &s;avages, perpetually ha|ra&s;&s;ing
one another. In one way or other,
therefore, the great duties of &s;ocial life mu&s;t
be performed. There mu&s;t be among man|kind
&s;ome reciprocal co-operation and aid.
In this all con&s;ent. But let us ob&s;erve,
that the&s;e duties may be performed from
different principles, and in different ways.
Sometimes they are performed merely from
<PB N="29" REF="38">
decency and regard to character; &s;ome|times
from fear, and even from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s,
which obliges men to &s;how kindne&s;s, in or|der
that they may receive returns of it. In
&s;uch ca&s;es, the exterior of fair behaviour
may be pre&s;erved. But all will admit, that
when from con&s;traint only, the offices of
&s;eeming kindne&s;s are performed, little de|pendance
can be placed on them, and little
value allowed to them.</P>
<P>By others, the&s;e offices are di&s;charged
&s;olely from a principle of duty. They are
men of cold affections, and perhaps of an
intere&s;ted character. But, overawed by a
&s;en&s;e of religion, and convinced that they
are bound to be beneficent, they fulfil the
cour&s;e of relative duties with regular tenor.
Such men act from con&s;cience and prin|ciple.
So far they do well, and are wor|thy
of prai&s;e. They a&s;&s;i&s;t their friends;
they give to the poor; they do ju&s;tice to
all. But what a different complexion is
given to the &s;ame actions, how much high|er
flavour do they acquire, when they flow
from the &s;en&s;ibility of a feeling heart? If
<PB N="30" REF="39">
one be not moved by affection, even &s;up|po&s;ing
him influenced by principle, he
will go no farther than &s;trict principle
appears to require. He will advance &s;low|ly,
and reluctantly. As it is ju&s;tice, not
genero&s;ity, which impells him, he will of|ten
feel as a ta&s;k what he is required by
con&s;cience to perform. Whereas, to him
who is prompted by virtuous &s;en&s;ibility,
every office of beneficence and humanity
is a plea&s;ure. He gives, a&s;&s;i&s;ts, and relives,
not merely becau&s;e he is bound to do &s;o,
but becau&s;e it would be painful for him
to refrain. Hence, the &s;malle&s;t benefit he
confers ri&s;es in its value, on account of its
carrying the affection of the giver impre&s;&s;|ed
upon the gift. It &s;peaks his heart; and
the di&s;covery of the heart is very frequent|ly
of greater con&s;equence than all that li|berality
can be&s;tow. How often will the
affectionate &s;mile of approbation gladden
the humble, and rai&s;e the dejected? How
often will the look of tender &s;ympathy, or
the tear that involuntarily falls, impart con|&s;olation
to the unhappy? By means of this
<PB N="31" REF="40">
corre&s;pondence of hearts, all the great du|ties
which we owe to one another are both
performed to more advantage, and endear|ed
in the performance. From true &s;en&s;ibi|lity
flow a thou&s;and good offices, apparent|ly
&s;mall in them&s;elves, but of high impor|tance
to the felicity of others; offices which
altogether e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation of the cold
and unfeeling, who, by the hardne&s;s of
their manner, render them&s;elves unamiable,
even when they mean to do good.&mdash;How
happy then would it be for mankind, if this
affectionate di&s;po&s;ition prevailed more ge|nerally
in the world! How much would
the &s;um of public virtue and public felicity
be increa&s;ed, if men were always inclined
to <HI>rejoice with them that rejoice, and to weep
with them that weep!</HI></P>
<P>BUT, be&s;ides the effect of &s;uch a temper
on general virtue and happine&s;s, let us con|&s;ider
its effect on the happine&s;s of him who
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it, and the various plea&s;ure to
which it gives him acce&s;s. If he be ma|&s;ter
of riches or influence, it affords him
<PB N="32" REF="41">
the means of increa&s;ing his own enjoy|ment,
by relieving the wants, or increa|&s;ing
the comforts of others. If he com|mand
not the&s;e advantages, yet all the
comforts which he &s;ees in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the de&s;erving become in &s;ome &s;orts his, by
his rejoicing in the good which they enjoy.
Even the face of nature yields a &s;atisfac|tion
to him which the in&s;en&s;ible can never
know. The profu&s;ion of goodne&s;s which
he beholds poured forth on the univer&s;e,
dilates his heart with the thought that in|numerable
multitudes around him are ble&s;t
and happy. When he &s;ees the labours of
men appearing to pro&s;per, and views a
country flouri&s;hing in wealth and indu&s;|try;
when he beholds the &s;pring coming
forth in its beauty, and reviving the de|cayed
face of nature; or in autumn be|holds
the fields loaded with plenty, and
the year crowned with all its fruits; he lifts
his affections with gratitude to the great
Father of all, and rejoices in the general
felicity and joy.</P>
<P>It may indeed be objected, that the &s;ame
<PB N="33" REF="42">
&s;en&s;ibility lays open the heart to be pier|ced
with many wounds from the di&s;tre&s;&s;es
which abound in the world; expo&s;es us to
frequent &s;uffering from the participation
which it communicates of the &s;orrows, as
well as of the joys of friend&s;hip. But let
it be con&s;idered, that the tender melancho|ly
of &s;ympathy is accompanied with a &s;en|&s;ation,
which they who feel it would not
exchange for the gratifications of the &s;el|fi&s;h.
When the heart is &s;trongly moved
by any of the kind affections, even when
it pours it&s;elf forth in virtuous &s;orrow, a
&s;ecret attractive charm mingles with the
painful emotion; there is a joy in the
mid&s;t of grief. Let it be farther con&s;ider|ed,
that the griefs which &s;en&s;ibility intro|duces
are counterbalanced by plea&s;ures
which flow from the &s;ame &s;ource. Sen&s;ibi|lity
heightens in general the human pow|ers,
and is connected with acutene&s;s in all
our feelings. If it make us more alive to
&s;ome painful &s;en&s;ations, in return, it ren|ders
the plea&s;ing ones more vivid and a|nimated.
The &s;elfi&s;h man langui&s;hes in
<PB N="34" REF="43">
his narrow circle of plea&s;ures. They are
confined to what affects his own intere&s;t.
He is obliged to repeat the &s;ame gratifica|tions,
till they become in&s;ipid. But the
man of virtuous &s;en&s;ibility moves in a wi|der
&s;phere of felicity. His powers are much
more frequently called forth into occupa|tions
of plea&s;ing activity. Numberle&s;s oc|ca&s;ions
open to him of indulging his fa|vourite
ta&s;te, by conveying &s;atisfaction to
others. Often it is in his power, in one way
or other, to &s;ooth the afflicted heart; to
carry &s;ome con&s;olation into the hou&s;e of
woe. In the &s;cenes of ordinary life, in the
dome&s;tic and &s;ocial intercour&s;es of men,
the cordiality of his affections chears and
gladdens him. Every appearance, every
de&s;cription of innocent happine&s;s, is enjoy|ed
by him. Every native expre&s;&s;ion of
kindne&s;s and affection among others is felt
by him, even though he be not the object
of it. Among a circle of friends, enjoying
one another, he is as happy as the happie&s;t.
In a word, he lives in a different &s;ort of
world from what the &s;elfi&s;h man inhabits.
<PB N="35" REF="44">
He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a new &s;en&s;e, which enables
him to behold objects which the &s;elfi&s;h
cannot &s;ee. At the &s;ame time, his enjoy|ments
are not of that kind which remain
merely on the &s;urface of the mind. They
penetrate the heart. They enlarge and e|levate,
they refine and ennoble it. To all
the plea&s;ing emotions of affection, they add
the dignified con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of virtue.&mdash;
Children of men! Men formed by nature
to live and to feel as brethren! How long
will ye continue to e&s;trange your&s;elves from
one another by competitions and jealou|&s;ies,
when in cordial union ye might be &s;o
much more ble&s;t? How long will ye &s;eek
your happine&s;s in &s;elfi&s;h gratifications a|lone,
neglecting tho&s;e purer and better
&s;ources of joy, which flow from the affec|tions
and the heart?</P>
<P>HAVING now explained the nature, and
&s;hown the value and high advantages of
true &s;en&s;ibility, I proceed to point out &s;ome
of the mi&s;taken forms, and abu&s;es of this
virtue.&mdash;In modern times, the chief im|provement
<PB N="36" REF="45">
of which we have to boa&s;t, is a
&s;en&s;e of humanity. This, notwith&s;tanding
the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s that &s;till prevails, is the fa|vourite
and di&s;tingui&s;hing virtue of the age.
On general manners, and on &s;everal depart|ments
of &s;ociety, it has had con&s;iderable
influence. It has abated the &s;pirit of per|&s;ecution:
It has even tempered the horrors
of war; and man is now more a&s;hamed than
he was in &s;ome former ages, of acting as a
&s;avage to man. Hence, &s;en&s;ibility is be|come
&s;o reputable a quality, that the ap|pearance
of it is frequently a&s;&s;umed when
the reality is wanting. Softne&s;s of man|ners
mu&s;t not be mi&s;taken for true &s;en&s;i|bility.
Sen&s;ibility indeed tends to produce
gentlene&s;s in behaviour; and when &s;uch
behaviour flows from native affection, it is
valuable and amiable. But the exterior
manner alone may be learned in the &s;chool
of the world; and often, too often, is found
to cover much unfeeling hardne&s;s of heart.
Profe&s;&s;ions of &s;en&s;ibility on every trifling
occa&s;ion, joined with the appearance of ex|ce&s;&s;ive
&s;oftne&s;s, and a profu&s;ion of &s;enti|mental
<PB N="37" REF="46">
language, afford always much
ground for di&s;tru&s;t. They create the &s;u&s;|picion
of a &s;tudied character. Frequently,
under a negligent and &s;eemingly rough
manner, there lies a tender and feeling
heart. Manline&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility are &s;o far
from being incompatible, that the truly
brave are, for the mo&s;t part, generous and
humane; while the &s;oft and effeminate are
hardly capable of any vigorous exertion of
affection.</P>
<P>As &s;en&s;ibility &s;uppo&s;es delicacy of feel|ing
with re&s;pect to others, they who af|fect
the highe&s;t &s;en&s;ibility are apt to carry
this delicacy to exce&s;s. They are, perhaps,
not incapable of the warmth of di&s;intere&s;t|ed
friend&s;hip; but they are become &s;o re|fined
in all their &s;en&s;ations; they enter|tain
&s;uch high notions of what ought to
corre&s;pond in the feelings of others to their
own; they are &s;o mightily hurt by every
thing which comes not up top their ideal
&s;tandard of reciprocal affection, as to pro|duce
di&s;quiet and unea&s;ine&s;s to all with
<PB N="38" REF="47">
whom they are connected. Hence, unju&s;t
&s;u&s;picions of their friends hence, ground|le&s;s
upbraidings, and complaints of un|kindne&s;s;
hence, a pronene&s;s to take vio|lent
offence at trifles. In con&s;equence of
examining their friends with a micro&s;co|pic
eye, what to an ordinary ob&s;erver
would not be unplea&s;ing, to them is gra|ting
and di&s;gu&s;ting. At the bottom of the
character of &s;uch per&s;ons there always lie
much pride, and attention to them&s;elves.
This is indeed a fal&s;e &s;pecies of &s;en&s;ibility.
It is the &s;ub&s;titution of a capricious and
irritable delicacy, in the room of that plain
and native tenderne&s;s of heart, which
prompts men to view others with indul|gent
eye, and to make great allowances for
the imperfections which are &s;ometimes ad|herent
to the mo&s;t amiable qualities.</P>
<P>THERE are others who affect not &s;en&s;i|bility
to this extreme, but who found
high claims to them&s;elves upon the degree
of intere&s;t which they take in the concerns
of others. Although their &s;en&s;ibility can
<PB N="39" REF="48">
produce no benefit to the per&s;on who is
its object, they always conceive that it in|titles
them&s;elves to &s;ome profitable returns.
The&s;e, often, are per&s;ons of refined and art|ful
character; who partly deceive them|&s;elves,
and partly employ their &s;en&s;ibility
as a cover to intere&s;t. He who acts from
genuine affection, when he is feeling along
with others in their joys or &s;orrows, thinks
not of any recompence to which this gives
him a title. He follows the impul&s;e of his
heart. He obeys the dictate of his nature;
ju&s;t as the vine by its nature produces
fruit, and the fountain pours forth its
&s;treams. Wherever views of intere&s;t, and
pro&s;pects of return, mingle with the feel|ings
of affection, &s;en&s;ibility acts an imper|fect
part, and intitles us to &s;mall &s;hare of
prai&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;ing it to be both complete
and pure, I mu&s;t caution you again&s;t re&s;t|ing
the whole merit of your character on
&s;en&s;ibility alone. It is indeed a happy con|&s;titution
of mind. It fits men for the pro|per
<PB N="40" REF="49">
di&s;charge of many duties, and gives
them acce&s;s to many virtuous plea&s;ures.
It is requi&s;ite for our acceptance either
with God or man. At the &s;ame time, if
it remain an in&s;tinctive feeling alone, it
will form no more than an imperfect cha|racter.
Complete virtue is of a more ex|alted
and dignified nature. It &s;uppo&s;es
&s;en&s;ibility, good temper, and benevolent
affections it includes them as e&s;&s;ential
parts; but it reaches farther: It &s;uppo&s;es
them to be &s;trengthened and confirmed by
principle; it requires them to be &s;upport|ed
by ju&s;tice, temperance, fortitude, and
all tho&s;e other virtues which enable us to
act with propriety, in the trying &s;ituations
of life.</P>
<P>It is very po&s;&s;ible for a man to po&s;&s;e&s;s
the kind affections in a high degree, while,
at the &s;ame time, he is carried away by
pa&s;&s;ion and plea&s;ure into many criminal
deeds. Almo&s;t every man values him&s;elf
on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing virtue in one or other of its
forms. He wi&s;hes to lay claim to &s;ome
quality which will render him e&s;timable
<PB N="41" REF="50">
in his own eye, as well as in that of the
public. Hence, it is common for many,
e&s;pecially for tho&s;e in the higher cla&s;&s;es of
life, to take much prai&s;e to them&s;elves on
account of their &s;en&s;ibility, though it be, in
truth, a &s;en&s;ibility of very defective kind.
They relent at the view of mi&s;ery when it is
&s;trongly &s;et before them. Often too, affected
chiefly by the powers of de&s;cription, it is at
feigned and pictured di&s;tre&s;s, more than at
real mi&s;ery, that they relent. The tears which
they &s;hed upon the&s;e occa&s;ions they con&s;ider
as undoubted proofs of virtue. They applaud
them&s;elves for the goodne&s;s of their hearts;
and conclude, that with &s;uch feelings they
cannot fail to be agreeable to Heaven. At
the &s;ame time, the&s;e tran&s;ient relentings
make flight impre&s;&s;ion on conduct. They
give ri&s;e to few, if any, good deeds; and
&s;oon after &s;uch per&s;ons have wept at &s;ome
tragical tale, they are ready to &s;tretch forth
the hand of oppre&s;&s;ion, to gra&s;p at the gain
of inju&s;tice, or to plunge into the torrent
of criminal plea&s;ures. This &s;ort of &s;en&s;i|bility
affords no more than a fallacious
<PB N="42" REF="51">
claim to virtue, and gives men no ground
to think highly of them&s;elves. We mu&s;t
inquire not merely how they feel, but how
their feelings prompt them to act, in order
to a&s;certain their real character.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude with ob&s;erving, that
&s;en&s;ibility, when genuine and pure, has a
&s;trong connection with piety. That warmth
of affection, and tenderne&s;s of heart, which
lead men to feel for their brethren, and to
enter into their joys and &s;orrows, &s;hould
naturally di&s;po&s;e them to melt at the re|membrance
of the divine goodne&s;s; to
glow with admiration of the divine ma|je&s;ty;
to &s;end up the voice of prai&s;e and
adoration to that Supreme Being who
makes his creatures happy. He who pre|tends
to great &s;en&s;ibility towards men, and
yet has no feeling for the high objects of
religion, no heart to admire and adore the
great Father of the univer&s;e, has rea&s;on to
di&s;tru&s;t the truth and delicacy of his &s;en&s;i|bility.
He has rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that in
&s;ome corner of his heart there lodges a &s;e|cret
<PB N="43" REF="52">
depravity, an unnatural hardne&s;s and
callou&s;ne&s;s, which vitiates his character.
&mdash;Let us &s;tudy to join all the parts of
virtue in proper union; to be con&s;i&s;tently
and uniformly good; ju&s;t and upright, as
well as pitiful and courteous; pious, as
well as &s;ympathi&s;ing. Let us pray to him
who made the heart, that he would fill it
with all proper di&s;po&s;itions; rectify all its
errors; and render it the happy abode of
per&s;onal integrity and &s;ocial tenderne&s;s, of
purity, benevolence, and devotion.</P>

that it cannot too often employ
religious meditation. There is nothing in
the management of which wi&s;dom is more
requi&s;ite or where mankind di&s;play their
incon&s;i&s;tency more. In its particular par|cels,
they appear entirely carele&s;s of it; and
throw it away with thoughtle&s;s profu&s;ion.
But, when collected into &s;ome of its great
portions, and viewed as the mea&s;ure of
their continuance in life, they become &s;en|&s;ible
<PB N="45" REF="54">
of its value, and begin to regard it
with a &s;erious eye. While day after day is
wa&s;ted in a cour&s;e of idlene&s;s or vicious
plea&s;ures, if &s;ome incident &s;hall occur
which leads the mo&s;t incon&s;iderate man to
think of his age, or time of life; how
much of it is gone; at what period of it he
is now arrived; and to what proportion of
it he can with any probability look for|ward,
as yet to come; he can hardly avoid
feeling &s;ome &s;ecret compunction, and re|flecting
&s;eriou&s;ly upon his &s;tate. Happy,
if that virtuous impre&s;&s;ion were not of mo|mentary
continuance, but retained its in|fluence
amid&s;t the &s;ucceeding cares and
plea&s;ures of the world! To the good old
Patriarch mentioned in the text, we have
rea&s;on to believe that &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions
were habitual. The que&s;tion put to him
by the Egyptian monarch produced, in his
an&s;wer, &s;uch reflections as were naturally
&s;uited to his time of life. <HI>And Jacob &s;aid
unto Pharoah, the days of the years of my pil|grimage
are an hundred and thirty years:
few and evil have the days of the years of my
<PB N="46" REF="55">
life been, and have not attained unto the days
of the years of the life of my fathers, in the
days of their pilgrimage.</HI> But the peculiar
circum&s;tances of the Patriarch, or the num|ber
of his years, are not to be the &s;ubject
of our pre&s;ent con&s;ideration. My purpo&s;e
is, to &s;how how we &s;hould be affected in
every period of human life, by reflection
upon our age, whether we be young, or
advanced in years; in order that the que|&s;tion,
<HI>How old art thou?</HI> may never be put
to any of us without &s;ome good effect.
There are three different portions of our
life which &s;uch a que&s;tion naturally calls to
view; that part of it which is pa&s;t; that
which is now pre&s;ent; and that to which
we fondly look forward, as future. Let
us con&s;ider in what manner we ought to
be affected by attending to each of the&s;e.</P>
<P>I. LET us review that part of our time
which is pa&s;t. According to the progre&s;s
which we have made in the journey of life,
the field which pa&s;t years pre&s;ent to our re|view
will be more or le&s;s exten&s;ive. But
<PB N="47" REF="56">
to every one they will be found to afford
&s;ufficient matter of humiliation and regret.
For where is the per&s;on, who having acted
for any time in the world, remembers not
many errors, and many follies, in his pa&s;t
behaviour? Who dares to &s;ay, that he has
improved, as he might have done, the va|rious
advantages which were afforded him;
and that he recalls nothing for which he
has rea&s;on either to grieve, or to blu&s;h?
When we recollect the &s;everal &s;tages of life
through which we have pa&s;&s;ed; the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive
occupations in which we have been
engaged, the de&s;igns we have formed, and
the hopes and fears which alternately have
filled our brea&s;t; how barren for mo&s;t
part is the remembrance; and how few
traces of any thing valuable or important
remain? like characters drawn on the
&s;and, which the next wave wa&s;hes totally
away, &s;o one trivial &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of events has
effaced the memory of the preceding; and
though we have &s;eemed all along to be bu|&s;y,
yet for much of what we have acted,
we are neither wi&s;er nor better than if &s;uch
<PB N="48" REF="57">
actions had never been. Hence, let the re|tro&s;pect
of what is pa&s;t produce, as its fir&s;t
effect, humiliation in our own eyes, and
aba&s;ement before God. Much do human
pride and &s;elf-complacency require &s;ome
correction; and that correction is never
more effectually admini&s;tered, than by an
impartial and &s;erious review of former life.</P>
<P>But though pa&s;t time be gone, we are
not to con&s;ider it as irredeemably lo&s;t. To
a very profitable purpo&s;e it may yet be ap|plied,
if we lay hold of it while it remains in
remembrance, and oblige it to contribute to
future improvement. If you have gained
nothing more by the years that are pa&s;t,
you have at lea&s;t gained experience; and
experience is the mother of wi&s;dom. You
have &s;een the weak parts of your character;
and may have di&s;covered the chief &s;ources of
your mi&s;conduct. To the&s;e let your atten|tion
be directed; on the&s;e, let the proper
guards be &s;et. If you have trifled long,
re&s;olve to trifle no more. If your pa&s;&s;ions
have often betrayed and degraded you,
&s;tudy how they may be kept, in future,
<PB N="49" REF="58">
under better di&s;cipline. Learn, at the &s;ame
time, never to tru&s;t pre&s;umptuou&s;ly in your
own wi&s;dom. Humbly apply to the Au|thor
of your being, and be&s;eech his grace
to guide you &s;afely through tho&s;e &s;lippery
and dangerous paths, in which experience
has &s;hown that you are &s;o ready to err, and
to fall.</P>
<P>In reviewing pa&s;t life, it cannot but oc|cur,
that many things now appear of in|con&s;iderable
importance, which once occu|pied
and attached us, in the highe&s;t de|gree.
Where are tho&s;e keen competitions,
tho&s;e mortifying di&s;appointments, tho&s;e
violent enmities, tho&s;e eager pur&s;uits, which
we once thought were to la&s;t for ever, and
on which we con&s;idered our whole happi|ne&s;s
or mi&s;ery as &s;u&s;pended? We look
back upon them now, as upon a dream
which has pa&s;&s;ed away. None of tho&s;e
mighty con&s;equences have followed which
we had predicted. The airy fabric has va|ni&s;hed,
and left no trace behind it. We
&s;mile at our former violence; and wonder
how &s;uch things could have ever appeared
<PB N="50" REF="59">
&s;o &s;ignificant and great. We may re&s;t a&s;|&s;ured,
that what hath been, &s;hall again be.
When Time &s;hall once have laid his lenient
hand on the pa&s;&s;ions and pur&s;uits of the
pre&s;ent moment, they too &s;hall lo&s;e that i|maginary
value which heated fancy now
be&s;tows upon them. Hence, let them al|ready
begin to &s;ub&s;ide to their proper level.
Let wi&s;dom infu&s;e a tincture of moderation
into the eagerne&s;s of conte&s;t, by anticipa|ting
that period of coolne&s;s, which the lap&s;e
of time will, of it&s;elf, certainly bring.&mdash;
When we look back on years that are pa&s;t,
how &s;wiftly do they appear to have fleeted
away? How in&s;en&s;ibly has one period of
life &s;tolen upon us after another, like the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive incidents in <HI>a tale that is told?</HI>
Before we were aware, childhood had grown
up into youth; youth had pa&s;&s;ed into man|hood;
and manhood now, perhaps, begins
to a&s;&s;ume the gray hair, and to decline in|to
old age. When we are carrying our
views forward, months and years to come
&s;eem to &s;tretch thorough a long and exten|&s;ive
&s;pace. But when the time &s;hall arrive
<PB N="51" REF="60">
of our looking back, they &s;hall appear con|tracted
within narrow bounds. Time, when
yet before us, &s;eems to advance with &s;low
and tardy &s;teps; no &s;ooner is it pa&s;t, than
we di&s;cern its wings.</P>
<P>It is a remarkable peculiarity in the re|tro&s;pect
of former life, that it is commonly
attended with &s;ome mea&s;ure of heavine&s;s of
heart. Even to the mo&s;t pro&s;perous, the
memory of joys that are pa&s;t is accompa|nied
with &s;ecret &s;orrow. In the days of
former years, many objects ari&s;e to view,
which make the mo&s;t unthinking, grave;
and render the &s;erious, &s;ad. The plea&s;u|rable
&s;cenes of youth, the objects on which
our affections had been early placed, the
companions and friends with whom we had
&s;pent many happy days, even the places
and the occupations to which we had been
long accu&s;tomed, but to which we have
now bid farewell, can hardly ever be re|called,
without &s;oftening, nor &s;ometimes,
without piercing, the heart. Such &s;en&s;a|tions,
to which few, if any, of my hearers,
are wholly &s;trangers, I now mention, as
<PB N="52" REF="61">
affording a &s;trong proof of that vanity of
the human &s;tate, which is &s;o often repre|&s;ented
in the &s;acred writings: And vain
indeed mu&s;t that &s;tate be, where &s;hades of
grief tinge the recollection of its brighte&s;t
&s;cenes. But, at the &s;ame time, though it
be very proper that &s;uch meditations &s;hould
&s;ometimes enter the mind, yet on them I
advi&s;e not the gentle and tender heart to
dwell too long. They are apt to produce a
fruitle&s;s melancholy; to deject, without
bringing much improvement; to thicken
the gloom which already hangs over hu|man
life, without furni&s;hing proportionable
a&s;&s;i&s;tance to virtue.</P>
<P>Let me advi&s;e you, rather to recall to view
&s;uch parts of former conduct, if any &s;uch
there be, as afford in the remembrance a
rational &s;atisfaction. And what parts of
conduct are the&s;e? Are they the pur&s;uits
of &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, the riots of jollity or
the di&s;plays of &s;how and vanity? No; I
appeal to your hearts, my friends, if what
you recollect with mo&s;t plea&s;ure be not the
innocent, the virtuous, the honourable parts
<PB N="53" REF="62">
of your pa&s;t life; when you were employ|ed
in cultivating your minds, and impro|ving
them with u&s;eful knowledge; when,
by regular application and per&s;evering la|bour,
you were laying the foundation of
future reputation and advancement; when
you were occupied in di&s;charging with fi|delity
the duties of your &s;tation, and ac|quiring
the e&s;teem of the worthy and the
good; when in &s;ome trying &s;ituation you
were enabled to act your part with firm|ne&s;s
and honour; or had &s;eized the happy
opportunity of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the de&s;erving of
relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and bringing down
upon your heads the <HI>ble&s;&s;ings of tho&s;e that
were ready to peri&s;h.&mdash;</HI> The&s;e, the&s;e are the
parts of former life which are recalled with
mo&s;t &s;atisfaction! On them alone, no heavi|ne&s;s
of heart attends. You enjoy them as a
trea&s;ure which is now &s;tored up, and put
beyond all danger of being lo&s;t. The&s;e
chear the hours of &s;adne&s;s, lighten the bur|den
of old age, and, through the mortify|ing
remembrance of much of the pa&s;t dart
a ray of light and joy.&mdash;From the review
<PB N="54" REF="63">
of the&s;e, and the compari&s;on of them with
the deceitful plea&s;ures of &s;in, let us learn
how to form our e&s;timate of happine&s;s. Let
us learn what is true, what is fal&s;e, in hu|man
plea&s;ures; and from experience of the
pa&s;t, judge of the quarter to which we
mu&s;t in future turn, if we would lay a
foundation for permanent &s;atisfaction. Af|ter
having thus reviewed the former years
of our life, let us con&s;ider,</P>
<P>II. WHAT attention is due to that period
of age in which we are at pre&s;ent placed.
Here lies the immediate and principal ob|ject
of our concern. For the recollection
of the pa&s;t is only as far of moment, as it
acts upon the pre&s;ent. The pa&s;t, to us
now, is little; the future, as yet, is no|thing.
Between the&s;e two great gulphs of
time &s;ub&s;i&s;ts the pre&s;ent, as an i&s;thmus or
bridge, along which we are all pa&s;&s;ing.
With ha&s;ty and incon&s;iderate &s;teps let us
not pa&s;s along it; but remember well, how
much depends upon our holding a &s;teady,
and properly conducted cour&s;e. <HI>What&s;o|ever
<PB N="55" REF="64">
ever thine hand findeth to do, do it now with
all thy might; for now is the accepted time;
now is the day of &s;alvation.</HI> Many direc|tions
might be given for the wi&s;e and reli|gious
improvement of the pre&s;ent; a few
of which only I &s;hall hint.</P>
<P>Let us begin with excluding tho&s;e &s;uper|fluous
avocations which unprofitably con|&s;ume
it. Life is &s;hort; much that is of
real importance remains to be done. If we
&s;uffer the pre&s;ent time to be wa&s;ted either
in ab&s;olute idlene&s;s, or in frivolous em|ployments,
it will hereafter call for ven|geance
again&s;t us. Removing therefore
what is merely &s;uperfluous, let us bethink
our&s;elves of what is mo&s;t material to be at|tended
to at pre&s;ent: As, fir&s;t and chief,
the great work of our &s;alvation; the di&s;|charge
of the religious duties which we
owe to God our Creator, and to Chri&s;t our
Redeemer. <HI>God waiteth</HI> as yet <HI>to be gra|cious;</HI>
whether he will wait longer, none of
us can tell. Now, therefore, <HI>&s;eek the Lord
while he may be found, call upon him while
be is near.</HI> Our &s;piritual intere&s;ts will be
<PB N="56" REF="65">
be&s;t promoted by regular performance of
all the duties of ordinary life. Let the&s;e,
therefore, occupy a great &s;hare of the pre|&s;ent
hour. Whatever our age, our charac|ter,
our profe&s;&s;ion, or &s;tation in the world,
requires us to do, in that let each revolving
day find us bu&s;y. Never delay till to-mor|row
what rea&s;on and con&s;cience tell you
ought to be performed to-day. To-mor|row
is not yours; and though you &s;hould
live to enjoy it, you mu&s;t not overload it
with a burden not its own. <HI>Sufficient for
the day will prove the</HI> duty <HI>thereof.</HI></P>
<P>The ob&s;ervance of order and method, is
of high con&s;equence for the improvement
of pre&s;ent time. He who performs every
employment in its due place and &s;ea&s;on,
&s;uffers no part of time to e&s;cape without
profit. He multiplies his days; for he
lives much in little &s;pace. Whereas he who
neglects order in the arrangement of his
occupations, is always lo&s;ing the pre&s;ent in
returning upon the pa&s;t, and trying, in
vain, to recover it when gone.&mdash;Let me
advi&s;e you frequently to make the pre&s;ent
<PB N="57" REF="66">
employment of time an object of thought.
A&s;k your&s;elves, about what are you now
bu&s;ied? What is the ultimate &s;cope of
your pre&s;ent pur&s;uits and cares? Can you
ju&s;tify them to your&s;elves? Are they like|ly
to produce any thing that will &s;urvive
the moment, and bring forth &s;ome fruit
for futurity? He who can give no &s;ati&s;|factory
an&s;wer to &s;uch que&s;tions as the&s;e,
has rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that his employment
of the pre&s;ent is not tending either to his
advantage, or his honour.&mdash;Finally let
me admoni&s;h you, that while you &s;tudy to
improve, you &s;hould endeavour al&s;o to en|joy,
the pre&s;ent hour. Let it not be di&s;|turbed
with groundle&s;s di&s;contents, or poi|&s;oned
with fooli&s;h anxieties about what is
to come: But look up to Heaven, and ac|knowledge,
with a grateful heart, the actual
ble&s;&s;ings you enjoy. If you mu&s;t admit,
that you are now in health, peace and
&s;afety; without any particular or uncom|mon
evils to afflict your condition; what
more can you rea&s;onably look for in this
vain and uncertain world? How little can
<PB N="58" REF="67">
the greate&s;t pro&s;perity add to &s;uch a &s;tate?
Will any future &s;ituation ever make you
happy, if now, with &s;o few cau&s;es of grief,
you imagine your&s;elves mi&s;erable? The
evil lies in the &s;tate of your mind, not in
your condition of fortune; and by no al|teration
of circum&s;tances is likely to be re|medied.
Let us now,</P>
<P>III. CONSIDER with what di&s;po&s;itions
we ought to look forward to tho&s;e years of
our life that may yet be to come. Merely
to look forward to them, is what requires
no admonition. Futurity is the great ob|ject
on which the imaginations of men are
employed; for the &s;ake of which the pa&s;t
is forgotten, and the pre&s;ent too often ne|glected.
All time is in a manner &s;wallow|ed
up by it. On futurity, men build their
de&s;igns; on futurity, they re&s;t their hopes;
and though not happy at the pre&s;ent, they
always reckon on becoming &s;o, at &s;ome
&s;ub&s;equent period of their lives. This pro|pen&s;ity
to look forward, was for wi&s;e pur|po&s;es
implanted in the human brea&s;t. It
<PB N="59" REF="68">
&s;erves to give proper occupation to the active
powers of the mind, and to quicken all its
exertions. But it is too often imoderate|ly
indulged, and gor&s;sly abu&s;ed. The cu|rio&s;ity
which &s;ometimes prompts per&s;ons to
inquire, by unlawful methods, into what
is to come, is equally fooli&s;h and &s;inful.
Let us re&s;tain all de&s;ire of penetrating far|ther
than is allowed us, into that dark and
unknown region. Futurity belongs to God:
and happy for us is that my&s;terious veil
with which his wi&s;dom has covered it.
Were it in our power to lift up the veil,
and to behold what it conceals, many and
many a thorn we would plant in our
brea&s;ts. The proper and rational conduct
of men with regard to futurity, is regulated
by two con&s;iderations: Fir&s;t, that much
of what it contains, mu&s;t remain to us
ab&s;olutely unknown; next, that there are
al&s;o &s;ome events in it which may be cer|tainly
known and fore&s;een.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, much of futurity is, and mu&s;t be,
entirely unknown to us. When we &s;pecu|late
<PB N="60" REF="69">
late about the continuance of our life, and
the events which are to fill it, we behold a
river which is always flowing; but which
&s;oon e&s;capes out of our &s;ight, and is cover|ed
with mi&s;ts and darkne&s;s. Some of its
windings we may endeavour to trace; but
it is only for a very &s;hort way that we are
able to pur&s;ue them. In endle&s;s conjec|tures
we quickly find our&s;elves bewil|dered;
and, often, the next event that
happens baffles all the rea&s;onings we had
formed concerning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of events.
The con&s;equence which follows from this
is, that all the anxiety about futurity,
which pa&s;&s;es the bounds of rea&s;onable pre|caution,
is unprofitable and vain. Certain
mea&s;ures are indeed nece&s;&s;ary to be taken
for our &s;afety. We are not to ru&s;h for|ward
incon&s;iderate and headlong. We mu&s;t
make, as far as we are able, provi&s;ion for
future welfare; and guard again&s;t dangers
which apparently threaten. But having
done this, we mu&s;t &s;top; and leave the re&s;t
to Him who di&s;po&s;eth of futurity at his
will. <HI>He who &s;itteth in the heavens laughs</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="70">
at the wi&s;dom and the plans of worldly
men. Wherefore, <HI>boa&s;t not thy&s;elf of to-mor|row;
for thou knowe&s;t not what a day may
bring forth.</HI> For the &s;ame rea&s;on, de&s;pair
not of to-morrow; for it may bring forth
good as well as evil. Vex not your&s;elves
with imaginary fears. The impending
black cloud, to which you look up with
&s;o much dread, may pa&s;s by harmle&s;s; or
though it &s;hould di&s;charge the &s;torm, yet,
before it breaks, you may be lodged in
that lowly man&s;ion which no &s;torms ever
touch.</P>
<P>In the next place, there are in futurity
&s;ome events which may be certainly fore|&s;een
by us, through all its darkne&s;s. Fir&s;t,
it may be confidently predicted, that no
&s;ituation into which it will bring us, &s;hall
ever an&s;wer fully to our hopes, or confer
perfect happine&s;s. This is as certain as if
we already &s;aw it, that life, in its future
periods, will continue to be what it has
heretofore been; that it will be a mixed
and varied &s;tate; a checquered &s;cene of
plea&s;ures and pains, of fugitive joys and
<PB N="62" REF="71">
tran&s;ient griefs, &s;ucceeding in a round to
one another. Whether we look forward
to the years of youth, or to tho&s;e of man|hood
and advanced life, it is all the &s;ame.
The world will be to us, what it has been
to generations pa&s;t. Set out, therefore, on
what remains of your journey under this
per&s;ua&s;ion. According to this mea&s;ure,
e&s;timate your future plea&s;ures; and calcu|late
your future gains. Carry always along
with you a mode&s;t and a temperate mind.
Let not your expectations from the years
that are to come ri&s;e too high; and your
di&s;appointments will be fewer, and more
ea&s;ily &s;upported.</P>
<P>Farther; this may be reckoned upon as
certain, that in every future &s;ituation of life,
a good con&s;cience, a well ordered mind, and
a humble tru&s;t in the favour of Heaven,
will prove the e&s;&s;ential ingredients of your
happine&s;s. In reflecting upon the pa&s;t,
you have found this to hold. A&s;&s;ure your|&s;elves
that in future, the ca&s;e will be the
&s;ame. The principal correctives of human
vanity and di&s;tre&s;s, mu&s;t be &s;ought for in
<PB N="63" REF="72">
religion and virtue. Entering on paths
which to you are new and unknown, place
your&s;elves under the conduct of a divine
guide. Follow the great <HI>Shepherd of I&s;rael,</HI>
who, amid&s;t the turmoil of this world,
leads his flock <HI>into green pa&s;tures and by the
&s;till waters.</HI> As you advance in life, &s;tudy
to improve both in good principles, and
in good practice. You will be enabled to
look to futurity without fear, if, whatever
it brings, it &s;hall find you regularly em|ployed
in <HI>doing ju&s;tly, loving mercy, and
walking humbly with the Lord your God.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, Whatever other things may be
dubious in futurity, two great events are
undoubtedly certain, death and judgement.
The&s;e, we all know, are to terminate the
whole cour&s;e of time; and we know them
to be not only certain, but to be approach|ing
nearer to us, in con&s;equence of every
day that pa&s;&s;es over our heads. To the&s;e,
therefore, let us look foward, not with the
dread of children, but with that manly &s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s
which belongs to men and Chri|&s;tians.
Let us not avert our view from
<PB N="64" REF="73">
them, as if we could place them at &s;ome
greater di&s;tance by excluding them from
our thoughts. This indeed is the refuge of
too many; but it is the refuge of fools,
who aggravate thereby the terrors they
mu&s;t encounter. For <HI>he that cometh, &s;hall
come, and will not tarry.</HI> To his coming, let
us look with a &s;teady eye; and as life ad|vances
through its progre&s;&s;ive &s;tages, pre|pare
for its clo&s;e, and for appearing before
him who made us.</P>
<P>THUS I have endeavoured to point out
the reflections proper to be made, when the
que&s;tion is put to any of us, <HI>How old art
thou?</HI> I have &s;hown with what eye we &s;hould
review the pa&s;t years of your life; in what
light we &s;hould con&s;ider the pre&s;ent; and
with what di&s;po&s;itions look forward to the
future: In order that &s;uch a que&s;tion may
always leave &s;ome &s;erious impre&s;&s;ion behind
it; and may di&s;po&s;e us <HI>&s;o to number</HI> to years
of our life, <HI>that we may apply our hearts unto
wi&s;dom.</HI></P>

Piety to God, and charity to men, are in|cumbent
upon per&s;ons of every age, as
&s;oon as they can think and act. Yet the&s;e
virtues, in different &s;tages of life, a&s;&s;ume
different forms; and when they appear in
that form which is mo&s;t &s;uited to our age,
they appear with peculiar gracefulne&s;s;
they give propriety to conduct, and add
dignity to character. In former di&s;cour&s;es
I have treated of the virtues which adorn
youth, and of the duties which &s;pecially
belong to old age<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">See vol. 1. Sermons 11. and 12.</NOTE> The circle of tho&s;e
duties which re&s;pect middle age is indeed
much larger. As that is the bu&s;y period
in the life of man, it includes in effect the
whole compa&s;s of religion, and therefore
cannot have its peculiar character &s;o de|finitely
marked and a&s;certained. At the
&s;ame time, during tho&s;e years wherein one
is &s;en&s;ible that he has advanced beyond
the confines of youth, but has not yet pa&s;&s;|ed
into the region of old age, there are &s;e|veral
<PB N="67" REF="76">
things which reflection on that por|tion
of human life &s;ugge&s;ts, or at lea&s;t
ought to &s;ugge&s;t, to the mind. Incon&s;i|derate
mu&s;t he be, who, in his gradual
progre&s;s throughout middle age, pau&s;es not,
at times, to think, how far he is now re|ceding
from youth; how near he draws to
the borders of declining age; what part it
is now incumbent on him to act; what
duties both God and the world have a title
to expect from him. To the&s;e, I am at
pre&s;ent to call your attention; as what
materially concern the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e
who are now my hearers.</P>
<P>I. I BEGIN with ob&s;erving, that the fir&s;t
duty of tho&s;e who are become men is, as
the text expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>to put away childi&s;h
things.</HI> The &s;ea&s;on of youthful levities,
follies, and pa&s;&s;ions, is now over. The&s;e
have had their reign; a reign perhaps too
long; and to which a termination is cer|tainly
proper at la&s;t. Much indulgence is
due to youth. Many things admit of ex|cu&s;e
then, which afterwards become un|pardonable.
<PB N="68" REF="77">
Some things may even be
graceful in youth, which, if not criminal,
are at lea&s;t ridiculous, in per&s;ons of matu|rer
years. It is a great trial of wi&s;dom, to
make our retreat from youth with pro|priety;
to a&s;&s;ume the character of man|hood,
without expo&s;ing our&s;elves to re|proach,
by an un&s;ea&s;onable remainder of
juvenility, on the one hand, or by preci&s;e
and di&s;gu&s;ting formality, on the other.
Nature has placed certain boundaries, by
which &s;he di&s;criminates the plea&s;ures, ac|tions,
and employments, that are &s;uited to
the different &s;tages of human life. It be|comes
us, neither to overleap tho&s;e boun|daries
by a tran&s;ition too ha&s;ty and vio|lent;
nor to hover too long on one &s;ide of
the limit, when nature calls us to pa&s;s o|ver
to the other.</P>
<P>There are particularly two things in
which middle age &s;hould pre&s;erve its di&s;|tinction
and &s;eparation from youth; the&s;e
are, levities of behaviour, and intemperate
indulgence of plea&s;ure. The gay &s;pirits of
the young often prompt an incon&s;iderate
<PB N="69" REF="78">
degree of levity, &s;ometimes amu&s;ing, &s;ome|times
offen&s;ive; but for which, though be|traying
the occa&s;ionally into &s;erious dan|gers,
their want of experience may plead
excu&s;e. A more compo&s;ed, and manly be|haviour
is expected in riper years. The
affectation of youthful vanities, degrades
the dignity of manhood; even renders its
manners le&s;s agreeable; and by aukward
attempts to plea&s;e, produces contempt.
Chearfulne&s;s is becoming in every age.
But the proper chearfulne&s;s of a man is as
different from the levity of the boy, as the
flight of the eagle is from the fluttering of
a &s;parrow in the air.</P>
<P>As all un&s;ea&s;onable returns to the levity
of youth ought to be laid a&s;ide,&mdash;an admo|nition
which equally belongs to both the
&s;exes,&mdash;&s;till more are we to guard again&s;t
tho&s;e intemperate indulgences of plea&s;ure,
to which the young are unhappily prone.
From the&s;e we cannot too &s;oon retreat.
They open the path to ruin, in every pe|riod
of our days. As long, however, as
the&s;e exce&s;&s;es are confined to the fir&s;t &s;tage
<PB N="70" REF="79">
of life, hope is left, that when this fever of
the &s;pirits &s;hall abate, &s;obriety may gain the
a&s;cendant, and wi&s;er coun&s;els have power
to influence conduct. But after the &s;ea|&s;on
of youth is pa&s;t, if its intemperate &s;pi|rit
remain; if, in&s;tead of li&s;tening to the
calls of honour, and bending attention to
the cares, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of men, the
&s;ame cour&s;e of idlene&s;s and &s;en&s;uality con|tinue
to be pur&s;ued, the ca&s;e becomes
more de&s;perate. A &s;ad pre&s;umption a|ri&s;es,
that long immaturity is to prevail;
and that the plea&s;ures and pa&s;&s;ions of the
youth are to &s;ink and overwhelm the man.
Difficult, I confe&s;s, it may prove to over|come
the attachments which youthful habits
had for a long while been forming. Hard,
at the beginning, is the ta&s;k, to impo&s;e on
our conduct re&s;traints which are altogether
unaccu&s;tomed and new. But this is a trial
which every one mu&s;t undergo, in enter|ing
on new &s;cenes of action, and new pe|riods
of life. Let tho&s;e who are in this
&s;ituation bethink them&s;elves, that all is now
at &s;take. Their character and honour, their
<PB N="71" REF="80">
future fortune and &s;ucce&s;s in the world,
depend in a great mea&s;ure on the &s;teps they
take, when fir&s;t they appear on the &s;tage
of active life. The world then looks to
them with ob&s;erving eye. It &s;tudies their
behaviour; and interprets all their motions,
as pre&s;ages of the line of future conduct
which they mean to hold. Now, there|fore,
<HI>put away childi&s;h things;</HI> di&s;mi&s;s your
former trifling amu&s;ements, and youthful
plea&s;ures; bla&s;t not the hopes which your
friends are willing to conceive of you.
Higher occupations, more &s;erious cares, a|wait
you. Turn your mind to the &s;teady
and vigorous di&s;charge of the part you are
called to act. This leads me,</P>
<P>II. To point out the particular duties
which open on tho&s;e who are in the middle
period of life. They are now come for|ward
to that field of action where they are
to mix in all the &s;tir and bu&s;tle of the
world; where all the human powers are
brought forth into full exerci&s;e; where all
all that is conceived to be important in hu|man
<PB N="72" REF="81">
affairs is ince&s;&s;antly going on around
them. The time of youth was the prepa|tion
for future action. In old age our ac|tive
part is &s;uppo&s;ed to be fini&s;hed, and re&s;t
is permitted. Middle age is the &s;ea&s;on when
we are expected to di&s;play the fruits which
education had prepared and ripened. In
this world, all of us were formed to be a&s;|&s;i&s;tants
to one another. The wants of &s;o|ciety
call for every man's labour, and re|quire
various departments to be filled up.
They require that &s;ome be appointed to
rule, and others to obey; &s;ome, to defend
the &s;ociety from danger, others to main|tain
its internal order and peace; &s;ome, to
provide the conveniencies of life, others to
promote the improvement of the mind;
many, to work; others to contrive and di|rect.
In &s;hort, within the &s;phere of &s;ociety
there is employment for every one; and in
the cour&s;e of the&s;e employments, many a
moral duty is to be performed; many a
religious grace to be exerci&s;ed. No one is
permitted to be a mere blank in the world.
No rank, nor &s;tation, no dignity of birth,
<PB N="73" REF="82">
nor extent of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, exempt any man
from contributing his &s;hare to public uti|lity
and good. This is the precept of God.
This is the voice of nature. This is the
ju&s;t demand of the human race upon one
another.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t que&s;tions, therefore,
which every man who is in the vigour of
his age &s;hould put to him&s;elf is, &startq;What
am I doing in this world? What have
I yet done, whereby I may glorify God,
and be u&s;eful to my fellows? Do I pro|perly
fill up the place which belongs to
my rank and &s;tation? Will any memo|rial
remain of my having exi&s;ted on the
earth? or are my days pa&s;&s;ing fruitle&s;s
away, now when I might be of &s;ome im|portance
in the &s;y&s;tem of human affairs?&endq;
&mdash;Let not any man imagine that he is of
no importance, and has, upon that ac|count,
a privilege to trifle with his days
at plea&s;ure. <HI>Talents</HI> have been give to all;
to &s;ome, <HI>ten;</HI> to others, <HI>five;</HI> to others,
<HI>two. Occupy with the&s;e</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Luke, xix. 13.</NOTE> <HI>till I come,</HI> is the
<PB N="74" REF="83">
command of the great Ma&s;ter to all. Where
&s;uperior abilities are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
advantages of fortune are enjoyed,
a wider range is afforded for u&s;eful exer|tion,
and the world is intitled to expect it.
But among tho&s;e who fill up the inferior
departments of &s;ociety, though the &s;phere
of u&s;efulne&s;s be more contracted, no one is
left entirely in&s;ignificant. Let us remem|ber,
that in all &s;tations and conditions, the
important relations take place, of ma&s;ters
or &s;ervants, hu&s;bands and wives, parents
and children, brothers and friends, citizens
and &s;ubjects. The di&s;charge of the duties
ari&s;ing from tho&s;e various relations, forms
a great portion of the work a&s;&s;igned to
the middle age of man. Though the part
we have to act may be confined within a
humble line, yet if it be honourably act|ed,
it will be always found to carry its
own reward.</P>
<P>In fine, indu&s;try, in all its virtuous
forms, ought to in&s;pirit and invigorate
manhood. This will add to it both &s;ati&s;|faction
<PB N="75" REF="84">
and dignity; will make the current
of our years, as they roll, flow along in a
clear and equable &s;tream, without the pu|trid
&s;tagnation of &s;loth and idlene&s;s. Idle|ne&s;s
is the great corrupter of youth; and
the bane and di&s;honour of middle age. He
who, in the prime of life, finds time to
hang heavy on his hands, may with much
rea&s;on &s;u&s;pect, that he has not con&s;ulted
the duties which the con&s;ideration of his
age impo&s;ed upon him; a&s;&s;uredly he has
not con&s;ulted his own happine&s;s. But a|mid&s;t
all the bu&s;tle of the world, let us not
forget,</P>
<P>III. To guard with vigilance again&s;t the
peculiar dangers which attend the period of
middle life. It is much to be regretted,
that in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things there is
no period of man's age in which his virtue
is not expo&s;ed to perils. Plea&s;ure lays its
&s;nares for youth: and after the &s;ea&s;on of
youthful follies is pa&s;t, other temptations,
no le&s;s formidable to virtue, pre&s;ently ari&s;e.
<PB N="76" REF="85">
The love of plea&s;ure is &s;ucceeded by the
pa&s;&s;ion for intere&s;t. In this pa&s;&s;ion the
whole mind is too often ab&s;orbed; and the
change thereby induced on the character is
of no amiable kind. Amid&s;t the exce&s;&s;es
of youth, virtuous affections often remain.
The attachments of friend&s;hip, the love of
honour, and the warmth of &s;en&s;ibility, give
a degree of lu&s;tre to the character, and co|ver
many a failing. But intere&s;t, when it is
become the ruling principle, both deba&s;es
the mind, and hardens the heart. It dead|ens
the feeling of every thing that is &s;ub|lime
or refined. It contracts the affections
within a narrow circle; and extingui&s;hes
all tho&s;e &s;parks of genero&s;ity and tender|ne&s;s
which once glowed in the brea&s;t.</P>
<P>In proportion as worldly pur&s;uits multi|ply,
and competitions ri&s;e, ambition, jealou|&s;y,
and envy, combine with intere&s;t to ex|cite
bad pa&s;&s;ions, and to increa&s;e the corrup|tion
of the heart. At fir&s;t, perhaps, it was
a man's intention to advance him&s;elf in the
world by none but fair and laudable me|thods.
<PB N="77" REF="86">
He retained for &s;ome time an aver|&s;ion
to whatever appeared di&s;honourable.
But here, he is encountered by the violence
of an enemy. There, he is &s;upplanted by
the addre&s;s of a rival. The pride of a &s;u|perior
in&s;ults him. The ingratitude of a
friend provokes him. Animo&s;ities ruffle
his temper. Su&s;picions poi&s;on his mind.
He finds, or imagines that he finds, the
artful and de&s;igning &s;urrounding him on
every hand. He views corruption and
iniquity prevailing; the mode&s;t neglected;
the forward and the crafty ri&s;ing to di&s;tinc|tion.
Too ea&s;ily, from the example of
others, he learns that my&s;tery of vice, call|ed
the way of the world. What he has
learned he fancies nece&s;&s;ary to practi&s;e for
his own defence; and of cour&s;e a&s;&s;umes
that &s;upple and ver&s;atile character, which
he ob&s;erves to be frequent, and which of|ten
has appeared to him &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>To the&s;e, and many more dangers of the
&s;ame kind, is the man expo&s;ed who is deep|ly
engaged in active life. No &s;mall degree
<PB N="78" REF="87">
of firmne&s;s in religious principle, and of
con&s;tancy in virtue, is requi&s;ite, in order to
prevent his being a&s;&s;imilated to the &s;pirit of
the world, and carried away by the <HI>multi|tude
of evil doers.</HI> Let him therefore call
to mind tho&s;e principles which ought to
fortify him again&s;t &s;uch temptations to vice.
Let him often recollect that, whatever his
&s;tation in life may be, he is a man; he is
a Chri&s;tian. The&s;e are the chief characters
which he has to &s;upport; characters &s;upe|rior
far, if they be &s;upported with dignity,
to any of the titles with which courts can
decorate him; &s;uperior to all that can be
acquired in the &s;trife of a bu&s;y world. Let
him think, that though it may be de&s;ire|able
to increa&s;e his opulence, or to advance
his rank, yet what he ought to hold much
more &s;acred is, to maintain his integrity and
honour. If the&s;e be forfeited, wealth or
&s;tation will have few charms left. They
will not be able to protect him long from
&s;inking into contempt in the eye of an ob|&s;erving
world. Even to his own eye he
<PB N="79" REF="88">
will at la&s;t appear ba&s;e and wretched.&mdash;
Let not the affairs of the world entirely in|gro&s;s
his time and thoughts. From that
contagious air which he breaths in the
mid&s;t of it, let him &s;ometimes retreat into
the &s;alutary &s;hade con&s;ecrated to devotion
and to wi&s;dom. There, conver&s;ing &s;eriou&s;|ly
with his own &s;oul, and looking up to
the Father of &s;pirits, let him &s;tudy to calm
tho&s;e unquiet pa&s;&s;ions, and to rectify tho&s;e
internal di&s;orders, which intercour&s;e with
the world had excited and increa&s;ed. In
order to render this medicine of the
mind more effectual, it will be highly pro|per,</P>
<P>IV. THAT as we advance in the cour&s;e
of years, we often attend to the lap&s;e of
time and life, and to the revolutions which
the&s;e are ever effecting. In this medita|tion,
one of the fir&s;t reflections which
&s;hould occur is, how much we owe to that
God who hath hitherto helped us; who
hath brought us on &s;o far in life; hath
<PB N="80" REF="89">
guided us through the &s;lippery paths of
youth, and now enables us to flouri&s;h in
the &s;trength of manhood. Look back, my
friends, to tho&s;e who &s;tarted along with
your&s;elves in the race of life. Think how
many of them have fallen around you.
Ob&s;erve how many blank &s;paces you can
number in the catalogue of tho&s;e who were
once your companions. If, in the mid&s;t
of &s;o much deva&s;tation, you have been
pre&s;erved and ble&s;&s;ed; con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly
what returns you owe to the goodne&s;s of
Heaven. Inquire whether your conduct
has corre&s;ponded to the&s;e obligations; whe|ther,
in public and in private, you have
honoured, as became you, the God of your
fathers; and whether, amid&s;t the unknown
occurrences that are yet before you, you
have ground to hope for the continued
protection of the Almighty.</P>
<P>Bring to mind the various revolutions
which you have beheld in human affairs,
&s;ince you became actors on this bu&s;y the|atre.
Reflect on the changes which have
taken place in men and manners, in opi|nions
<PB N="81" REF="90">
and cu&s;toms, in private fortunes, and
in public conduct. By the ob&s;ervations
you have made on the&s;e, and the experi|ence
you have gained, have you impro|ved
poroportionably in wi&s;dom? Have the
changes of the world which you have wit|ne&s;&s;ed,
loo&s;ened all unrea&s;onable attachment
to it? Have they taught you this great
le&s;&s;on, that, while <HI>the fa&s;hion of the world</HI> is
ever <HI>pa&s;&s;ing away,</HI> only in God and in vir|tue,
&s;tability is to be found? Of great u&s;e,
amid&s;t the whirl of the world, are &s;uch
pau&s;es as the&s;e in life; &s;uch re&s;ting places
of thought and reflection; whence we can
calmly and deliberately look back on the
pa&s;t, and anticipate the future.</P>
<P>To the future, we are often ca&s;ting an
eager eye, and fondly &s;toring it, in our i|magination,
with many a plea&s;ing &s;cene.
But if we would look to it, like wi&s;e men,
let it be under the per&s;ua&s;ion that it is
nearly to re&s;emble the pa&s;t, in bringing
forward a mixture of alternate hopes and
fears, of griefs and joys. In order to be
prepared for whatever it may bring, let us
<PB N="82" REF="91">
cultivate that manly fortitude of mind,
which, &s;upported by a pious tru&s;t in God,
will enable us to encounter properly the
vici&s;&s;itudes of our &s;tate. No quality is
more nece&s;&s;ary than this, to them who are
pa&s;&s;ing through that &s;tormy &s;ea&s;on of life
of which we now treat. Softne&s;s and ef|feminacy,
let them leave to the young and
unexperienced, who are amu&s;ing them&s;elves
with florid pro&s;pects of bli&s;s. But to tho&s;e
who are now engaged in the middle of
their cour&s;e, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be well
acquainted with the world, and to know
that they have to &s;truggle in it with va|rious
hard&s;hips, firmne&s;s, vigour, and re|&s;olution,
are di&s;po&s;itions more &s;uitable.
They mu&s;t buckle on well this armour of
the mind, if they would i&s;&s;ue forth into
the conte&s;t with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;
While we thus &s;tudy to correct the er|rors,
and to provide again&s;t the dangers,
which are peculiar to this &s;tage of life,
let us al&s;o,</P>
<P>V. LAY foundation for comfort in old
<PB N="83" REF="92">
age. That is a period which all expect and
hope to &s;ee; and to which, amid&s;t the toils
of the world, men &s;ometimes look for|ward,
not without &s;atisfaction, as to the
period of retreat and re&s;t. But let them
not deceive them&s;elves. A joyle&s;s and
dreary &s;ea&s;on it will prove, if they arrive
at it with an unimproved, or corrupted
mind. For old age, as for every other
thing, a certain preparation is requi&s;ite;
and that preparation con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in three
particulars; in the acqui&s;ition of know|ledge,
of friends, of virtue. There is an
acqui&s;ition of another kind, of which it is
altogether needle&s;s for me to give any re|commendation,
that of riches. But though
this, by many, will be e&s;teemed a more mate|rial
acqui&s;ition than all the three I have na|med,
it may be confidently pronounced,
that, without the&s;e other requi&s;ites, all the
wealth we can lay up in &s;tore will prove
in&s;ufficient for making our latter days pa&s;s
&s;moothly away.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, He who wi&s;hes to render his old
age comfortable, &s;hould &s;tudy betimes to
<PB N="84" REF="93">
enlarge and improve his mind; and by
thought and inquiry, by reading and re|flecting,
to acquire a ta&s;te for u&s;eful know|ledge.
This will provide for him a great
and noble entertainment, when other en|tertainments
leave him. If he bring into
the &s;olitary retreat of age a vacant, unin|formed
mind, where no knowledge dawns,
where no ideas ri&s;e, which has nothing to
feed upon within it&s;elf, many a heavy and
comfortle&s;s day he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s.&mdash;
Next, When a man declines into the vale
of years, he depends more on the aid of
his friends, than in any other period of his
life. Then is the time, when he would
e&s;pecially wi&s;h to find him&s;elf &s;urrounded
by &s;ome who love and re&s;pect him; who
will bear with his infirmities, relieve him
of his labours, and chear him with their
&s;ociety. Let him, therefore, now, in the
&s;ummer of his days, while yet active and
flouri&s;hing, by acts of &s;ea&s;onable kindne&s;s
and beneficence en&s;ure that love, and by
upright and honourable conduct lay foun|dation
for that re&s;pect, which in old age
<PB N="85" REF="94">
he would wi&s;h to enjoy.&mdash;In the la&s;t place,
Let him con&s;ider a good con&s;cience, peace
with God, and the hope of heaven, as the
mo&s;t effectual con&s;olations he can po&s;&s;e&s;s,
when the <HI>evil days</HI> &s;hall come, wherein,
otherwi&s;e, he is likely to find little plea|&s;ure.
It is not merely by tran&s;ient acts
of devotion that &s;uch con&s;olations are
to be provided. The regular tenor of a
virtuous and pious life, &s;pent in the faith|ful
di&s;charge of all the duties of our &s;ta|tion,
will prove the be&s;t preparation for
old age, for death, and for immortality.</P>
<P>AMONG the mea&s;ures thus taken for the
latter &s;cenes of life, let me admoni&s;h every
one not to forget to put his worldly affairs
in order, in due time. This is a duty
which he owes to his character, to his fa|mily,
or to tho&s;e, whoever they be, that
are to &s;ucceed him; but a duty too often
unwi&s;ely delayed, from a childi&s;h aver&s;ion
to entertain any thoughts of quitting the
world. Let him not tru&s;t much to what
he will do in his old age. Sufficient for
<PB N="86" REF="95">
that day, if he &s;hall live to &s;ee it, will be
the burden thereof. It has been remark|ed,
that as men advance in years, they
care le&s;s to think of death. Perhaps it oc|curs
oftener to the thoughts of the young,
than of the old. Feeblene&s;s of &s;pirit ren|ders
melancholy ides more oppre&s;&s;ive;
and after having been &s;o long accu&s;tomed
and inured to the world, men bear wor&s;e
with any thing which reminds them that
they mu&s;t &s;oon part with it.&mdash;However,
as to part with it is the doom of all, let
us take mea&s;ures betimes for going off the
&s;tage, when it &s;hall be our turn to with|draw,
with decency and propriety; leaving
nothing unfulfilled which it is expedient
to have done before we die. To live long,
ought not to be our favourite wi&s;h, &s;o
much as to live well. By continuing too
long on earth, we might only live to wit|ne&s;s
a greater number of melancholy &s;cenes,
and to expo&s;e our&s;elves to a wider compa&s;s
of human woe. He who has &s;erved his
generation faithfully in the world, has du|ly
honoured God, and been beneficent and
<PB N="87" REF="96">
u&s;eful to mankind; he who in his life has
been re&s;pected and beloved; who&s;e death
is accompanied with the &s;incere regret of
all who knew him, and who&s;e memory is
honoured; that man has &s;ufficiently fulfil|led
his cour&s;e, whether it was appointed by
Providence to be long or &s;hort. For <HI>ho|nourable
age is not that which &s;tandeth in
length of time, nor that which is mea&s;ured by
number of years; but wi&s;dom is the gray hair
to man; and an un&s;potted life is old age</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Wi&s;dom, iv. 8. 9.</NOTE>.</P>

<PB N="89" REF="98">
awe would fill him; he would &s;top &s;hort in

however, would prove un&s;uitable to

became &s;o &s;trong as to render men unfit for

<P>Yet, familiar as death is now become, it

it is into my purpo&s;e to treat, at pre&s;ent, of
the in&s;tructions to be drawn from the pro|&s;pect

my&s;elf to the death of others; to con&s;ider
death as one of the mo&s;t frequent and con|&s;iderable
events that happen in the cour&s;e
of human affairs; and to &s;how in what
manner we ought to be affected, fir&s;t, by
the death of &s;trangers, or indifferent per|&s;ons;
&s;econdly, by the death of friends;
and thirdly, by the death of enemies.</P>
<P>1. BY the death of indifferent per&s;ons;
<PB N="91" REF="100">
if any can be called indifferent, to whom
we are &s;o nearly allied as brethren by na|ture,
and brethren in mortality. When
we ob&s;erve the funerals that pa&s;s along the
&s;treets, or when we walk among the mo|numents
of death, the fir&s;t thing that na|turally
&s;trikes us is the undi&s;tingui&s;hing
blow, with which that common enemy le|vels
all. We behold a great promi&s;cuous
multitude all carried to the &s;ame abode;
all lodged in the &s;ame dark and &s;ilent man|&s;ions.
There, mingle per&s;ons of every age
and character, of every rank and condition
in life; the young and the old, the poor
and the rich, the gay and the grave, the
renowned and the ignoble. A few weeks
ago, mo&s;t of tho&s;e whom we have &s;een car|ried
to the grave, walked about as we do
now on the earth; enjoyed their friends,
beheld the light of the &s;un, and were form|ing
de&s;igns for future days. Perhaps, it is
not long &s;ince they were engaged in &s;cenes
of high fe&s;tivity. For them, perhaps, the
cheerful company a&s;&s;embled; and in the
mid&s;t of the circle they &s;hone with gay and

they hear the voice of mirth, or behold the
face of man. They are &s;wept from the

They are <HI>carried away as with a flood: The

<P>When we contemplate this de&s;olation of
the human race; this final termination of
&s;o many hopes; this &s;ilence that now regins
among tho&s;e who, a little while ago, were
&s;o bu&s;y, or &s;o gay; who can avoid being
rouched with &s;en&s;ations at once awful and
tender? What heart but then warms with
the glow of humanity? In who&s;e eye does
not the tear gather, on revolving the fate of
pa&s;&s;ing and &s;hortlived man? Such &s;en&s;a|tions
are &s;o congenial to human nature, that
they are attended with a certain kind of
&s;orrowful plea&s;ure. Even voluptuaries them|&s;elves,
&s;ometimes indulge a ta&s;te for fune|real
melancholy. After the fe&s;tive a&s;&s;embly
is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, they chu&s;e to walk retired in
the &s;hady grove, and to contemplate the ve|nerable
&s;epulchres of their ance&s;tors. This
<PB N="93" REF="102">
melancholy plea&s;ure ari&s;es from two differ|ent
&s;entiments meeting at the &s;ame time in
the brea&s;t; a &s;ympathetic &s;en&s;e of the &s;hort|ne&s;s
and vanity of life, and a per&s;ua&s;ion
that &s;omething exi&s;ts after death; &s;enti|ments,
which unite at the view of <HI>the hou&s;e

the confines of both worlds. It, at once,
pre&s;ents to us the termination of the inquie|tudes

of eternal re&s;t. <HI>There,</HI> in the elegant ex|pre&s;&s;ions

conveys no high idea of the boa&s;ted plea|&s;ures
of the world. It &s;hows how much
all mankind have felt this life to be a &s;cene
of trouble and care; and have agreed in
opinion, that perfect re&s;t is to be expected
only in the grave.</P>
<P><HI>There,</HI> &s;ays Job, <HI>are the &s;mall and the
great.</HI> There, the poor man lays down at
la&s;t the burden of his weari&s;ome life. No
more &s;hall he groan under the load of po|verty
and toil. No more &s;hall he hear the
in&s;olent calls of the ma&s;ter, from whom he
received his &s;canty wages. No more &s;hall
he be rai&s;ed from needful &s;lumber on his
bed of &s;traw, nor be hurried away from
his homely meal, to undergo the repeated
labours of the day. While his humble grave
is preparing, and a few poor and decayed
neighbours are carrying him thither, it is
good for us to think, that this man too was
our brother; that for him the aged and de|&s;titute
wife, and the needy children now
weep; that, neglected as he was by the
world, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed perhaps both a &s;ound
under&s;tanding, and a worthy heart; and is
<PB N="95" REF="104">
now carried by angels to re&s;t in Abraham's
bo&s;om.&mdash;At no great di&s;tance from him, the
grave is opened to receive the rich and proud
man. For, as it is &s;aid with empha&s;is in
the parable, <HI>the rich man al&s;o died, and was
buried</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Luke. xvi. 22.</NOTE>. He <HI>al&s;o</HI> died. His riches prevent|ed
not his &s;haring the &s;ame fate with the
poor man; perhaps, through luxury, they
accelerated his doom. Then, indeed, <HI>the
mourners go about the &s;treets;</HI> and while, in
all the pomp and magnificence of woe, his
funeral is prepared, his heirs, in the mean
time, impatient to examine his will, are
looking on one another with jealous eyes,
and already beginning to quarrel about the
divi&s;ion of his &s;ub&s;tance.&mdash;One day, we
&s;ee carried along the coffin of the &s;miling
infant; the flower ju&s;t nipped as it began to
blo&s;&s;om in the parents view: and the next
day, we behold the young man, or young
woman, of blooming form and promi&s;ing
hopes laid in an untimely grave. While
the funeral is attended by a numerous, un|concerned
<PB N="96" REF="105">
company, who are di&s;cour&s;ing
to one another about the news of the day,
or the ordinary affairs of life, let our
thoughts rather follow to the hou&s;e of
mourning, and repre&s;ent to them&s;elves what
is going on there. There, we would &s;ee a
di&s;con&s;olate family, &s;itting in &s;ilent grief,
thinking of the &s;ad breach that is made in
their little &s;ociety; and, with tears in their
eyes, looking to the chamber that is now
left vacant, and to every memorial that
pre&s;ents it&s;elf of their departed friend. By
&s;uch attention to the woes of others, the
&s;elfi&s;h hardne&s;s of our hearts will be gra|dually
&s;oftened, and melted down into hu|manity.</P>
<P>Another day, we follow to the grave one
who, in old age, and after a long career
of life, has in full maturity &s;unk at la&s;t
into re&s;t. As we are going along to the
man&s;ion of the dead, it is natural for us to
think, and to di&s;cour&s;e, of all the changes
which &s;uch a per&s;on has &s;een during the
cour&s;e of his life. He has pa&s;&s;ed, it is
likely, through varieties of fortune. He
<PB N="97" REF="106">
has experienced pro&s;perity, and adver&s;ity.
He has &s;een families and kindreds ri&s;e and
fall. He has &s;een peace and war &s;ucceed|ing
in their turns; the face of his country
undergoing many alterations; and the ve|ry
city in which he dwelt ri&s;ing, in a man|ner,
new around him. After all he has
beheld, his eyes are now clo&s;ed for ever.
He was becoming a &s;tranger in the mid&s;t
of a new &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of men. A race who
knew him not, had ari&s;en to fill the earth.
Thus pa&s;&s;es the world away. Throughout
all ranks and conditions, <HI>one generation pa&s;&s;|eth,
and another generation cometh;</HI> and this
great inn is by turns evacuated, and re|pleni&s;hed,
by troops of &s;ucceeding pilgrims.
&mdash;O vain and incon&s;tant world! O fleet|ing
and tran&s;ient life! When will the &s;ons
of men learn to think of thee, as they
ought? When will they learn humanity
from the afflictions of their brethren; or
moderation and wi&s;dom, from the &s;en&s;e of
their own fugitive &s;tate?&mdash;But, now to
come nearer to our&s;elves, let us,</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="107">
II. CONSIDER the death of our friends.
Want of reflection, or the long habits, ei|ther
of a very bu&s;y, or a very di&s;&s;ipated life,
may have rendered men in&s;en&s;ible to all
&s;uch objects as I have now de&s;cribed. The
&s;tranger, and the unknown, fall utterly
unnoticed at their &s;ide. Life proceeds with
them in its u&s;ual train, without being af|fected
by events in which they take no
per&s;onal concern. But the di&s;&s;olution of
tho&s;e ties which had long bound men toge|ther,
in intimate and familiar union, gives
a painful &s;hock to every heart. When a
family, who, for years, had been living in
comfort and peace, are &s;uddenly &s;hattered
by &s;ome of their mo&s;t beloved or re&s;pected
members being torn from them; when
the hu&s;band or the &s;pou&s;e are &s;eparated for
ever from the companion who, amid&s;t eve|ry
vici&s;&s;itude of fortune, &s;olaced their life;
who had &s;hared all their joys, and partici|pated
in all their &s;orrows; when the weep|ing
parent is folding in his arms the dying
child whom he tenderly loved; when he
is giving his la&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, receiving the
<PB N="99" REF="108">
la&s;t fond adieu, looking for the la&s;t time
on that countenance, now wa&s;ting and fa|ded,
which he had once beheld with much
delight; then is the time, when the heart
is made to drink all the bitterne&s;s of hu|man
woe.&mdash;But I &s;eek not to wound your
feelings by dwelling on the&s;e &s;ad de&s;crip|tions.
Let us rather turn our thoughts to
the manner in which &s;uch events ought
to be received and improved, &s;ince happen
they mu&s;t in the life of man.</P>
<P>Then, indeed, is the time to weep. Let
not a fal&s;e idea of fortitude, or mi&s;taken
conceptions of religious duty, be employed
to re&s;train the bur&s;ting emotion. Let the
heart &s;eek its relief, in the free effu&s;ion of
ju&s;t and natural &s;orrow. It is becoming in
every one to &s;how, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, that
he feels, as a man ought to feel. At the
&s;ame time, let moderation temper the grief
of a good man and a Chri&s;tian. He mu&s;t
not <HI>&s;orrow like tho&s;e who have no hope.</HI> As
high elation of &s;pirits befits not the joys,
&s;o continued and overwhelming dejection
&s;uits not the griefs of this tran&s;itory world.
<PB N="100" REF="109">
Grief, when it goes beyond certain bounds,
becomes unmanly; when it la&s;ts beyond a
certain time, becomes un&s;ea&s;onable. Let
him not reject the alleviation which time
brings to all the wounds of the heart, but
&s;uffer exce&s;&s;ive grief to &s;ub&s;ide, by degrees,
into a tender and affectionate remem|brance.
Let him con&s;ider, that it is in the
power of Providence to rai&s;e him up other
comforts in the place of tho&s;e he has lo&s;t.
Or, if his mind, at pre&s;ent, reject the
thoughts of &s;uch con&s;olation, let it turn
for relief to the pro&s;pect of a future meet|ing
in a happier world. This is indeed
the chief &s;oother of affliction; the mo&s;t
powerful balm of the bleeding heart. It
a&s;&s;i&s;ts us to view death, as no more than
a temporary &s;eparation of friends. They
whom we have loved &s;till live, though not
pre&s;ent to us. They are only removed in|to
a different man&s;ion in the hou&s;e of the
common Father. The toils of their pil|grimage
are fini&s;hed; and they are gone
to the land of re&s;t and peace. They are
gone from this dark and troubled world,
<PB N="101" REF="110">
to join the great a&s;&s;embly of the ju&s;t; and
to dwell in the mid&s;t of everla&s;ting light.
In due time we hope to be a&s;&s;ociated with
them in the&s;e bli&s;sful habitations. Until
this &s;ea&s;on of re-union arrive, no principle
of religion di&s;courages our holding corre|&s;pondence
of affection with them by means
of faith and hope.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, let us re&s;pect the virtues,
and cheri&s;h the memory, of the decea&s;ed.
Let their little failings be now forgotten.
Let us dwell on what was amiable in their
character, imitate their worth, and trace
their &s;teps. By this means, the remem|brance
of tho&s;e whom we loved &s;hall be|come
u&s;eful and improving to us, as well
as &s;acred and dear; if we accu&s;tom our|&s;elves
to con&s;ider them as &s;till &s;peaking,
and exhorting us to all that is good; if,
in &s;ituations where our virtue is tried, we
call up their re&s;pected idea to view, and,
as placed in their pre&s;ence, think of the
part which we could act before them with|out
a blu&s;h.</P>
<P>Moreover, let the remembrance of the
<PB N="102" REF="111">
friends whom we have lo&s;t, &s;trengthen our
affection to tho&s;e that remain. The nar|rower
the circle becomes of tho&s;e we love,
let us draw the clo&s;er together. Let the
heart that has been &s;oftened by &s;orrow,
mellow into gentlene&s;s and kindne&s;s; make
liberal allowance for the weakne&s;&s;es of
other; and dive&s;t it&s;elf of the little pre|judices
that may have formerly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed
it again&s;t them. The greater havock
that death has made among our friends
on earth, let us cultivate connection more
with God, and heaven, and virtue. Let
tho&s;e noble views which man's immortal
character affords, fill and exalt our minds.
Pa&s;&s;engers only through this &s;ublunary re|gion,
let our thoughts often a&s;cend to that
divine country, which we are taught to
con&s;ider as the native &s;eat of the &s;oul.
There, we form connections that are ne|ver
broken. There, we meet with friends
who never die. Among cele&s;tial things
there is firm and la&s;ting con&s;tancy, while
all that is on earth changes and pa&s;&s;es a|way.&mdash;
Such are &s;ome of the fruits we
<PB N="103" REF="112">
&s;hould reap from the tender feelings ex|cited
by the death of friends. But they
are not only our friends who die. Our
enemies al&s;o mu&s;t go to their <HI>long home.</HI>
Let us, therefore,</P>
<P>III. CONSIDER how we ought to be af|fected,
when they from whom &s;u&s;picions
have alienated, or rivalry has divided us;
they with whom we have long contended,
or by whom we imagine our&s;elves to have
&s;uffered wrong, are laid, or about to be
laid, in the grave. How incon&s;iderable
then appear tho&s;e broils in which we had
been long involved, tho&s;e conte&s;ts and
feuds which we thought were to la&s;t for
ever? The awful moment that now ter|minates
them, makes us feel their vanity.
If there be a &s;park of humanity left in the
brea&s;t, the remembrance of our common
fate then awakens it. Is there a man, who,
if he were admitted to &s;tand by the death|bed
of his bittere&s;t enemy, and beheld him
enduring that conflict which human na|ture
mu&s;t &s;uffer at the la&s;t, would not be
<PB N="104" REF="113">
inclined to &s;tretch forth the hand of friend|&s;hip,
to utter the voice of forgivene&s;s, and
to wi&s;h for perfect reconciliation with him
before he left the world? Who is there
that, when he beholds the remains of his
adver&s;ary depo&s;ited in the du&s;t, feels not,
in that moment, &s;ome relentings at the re|membrance
of tho&s;e pa&s;t animo&s;ities which
mutually embittered their life?&mdash;&startq;There
lies the man with whom I contended &s;o
long, &s;ilent and mute for ever. He is
fallen; and I am about to follow him.
How poor is the advantage which I now
enjoy? Where are the fruits of all our
conte&s;ts? In a &s;hort time we &s;hall be
laid together; and no remembrance re|main
of either of us, under the &s;un.
How many mi&s;takes may there have
been between us? Had not he his vir|tues
and good qualities, as well as I?
When we &s;hall both appear before the
judgement-&s;eat of God, &s;hall I be found
innocent, and free of blame, for all the
enmity I have borne to him?&endq;&mdash;My
friends, let the anticipation of &s;uch &s;enti|ments,
<PB N="105" REF="114">
&s;erve now to correct the inveteracy
of prejudice, to cool the heat of anger, to
allay the fiercene&s;s of re&s;entment. How
unnatural is it for animo&s;ities &s;o la&s;ting to
po&s;&s;e&s;s the hearts of mortal men, that no|thing
can extingui&s;h them, but the cold
hand of death? Is there not a &s;ufficient
proportion of evils in the &s;hort &s;pan of
human life, that we &s;eek to increa&s;e their
number, by ru&s;hing into unnece&s;&s;ary con|te&s;ts
with one another? When a few &s;uns
more have rolled over our heads, friends
and foes &s;hall have retreated together; and
their love and their hatred be equally bu|ried.
Let our few days, then, be &s;pent in
peace. While we are all journeying on|wards
to death, let us rather <HI>bear one an|other's
burdens,</HI> than hara&s;s one another by
the way. Let us &s;mooth and chear the
road as much as we can, rather than fill
the valley of our pilgrimage with the
hateful monuments of our contention and
&s;trife.</P>
<P>THUS I have &s;et before you &s;ome of
<PB N="106" REF="115">
tho&s;e meditations which are naturally &s;ug|ge&s;ted
by the prevalence of death around
us; by the death of &s;trangers, of friends,
and of enemies. Becau&s;e topics of this na|ture
are obvious, let it not be thought that
they are without u&s;e. They require to be
recalled, repeated, and enforced. Moral
and religious in&s;truction derives its efficacy,
not &s;o much from what men are taught to
know, as from what they are brought to
feel. It is not the dormant knowledge of
any truths, but the vivid impre&s;&s;ion of
them, which has influence on practice.
Neither let is be thought, that &s;uch medita|tions
are un&s;ea&s;onable intru&s;ions upon tho&s;e
who are living in health, in affluence, and
ea&s;e. There is no hazard of their making
too deep or painful an impre&s;&s;ion. The
gloom which they occa&s;ion is tran&s;ient; and
will &s;oon, too &s;oon, it is probable, be di&s;|pelled
by the &s;ucceeding affairs and plea|&s;ures
of the world. To wi&s;dom it certain|ly
belongs, that men &s;hould be impre&s;&s;ed
with ju&s;t views of their nature, and their
&s;tate: and the plea&s;ures of life will always
<PB N="107" REF="116">
be enjoyed to mo&s;t advantage when they
are tempered with &s;erious thought. There
is <HI>a time to mourn,</HI> as well as <HI>a time to rejoice.</HI>
There is a virtuous <HI>&s;orrow, which is better
than laughter.</HI> There is a <HI>&s;adne&s;s of the coun|tenance,
by which the heart is made better.</HI></P>

<P>THOUGH human nature be now fallen
from its original honour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VI.</NOTE> &s;everal good
principles &s;till remain in the hearts of men.
There are few, if any, on who&s;e minds the
reverence for a Supreme Being continues
not, in &s;ome degree, impre&s;&s;ed. In every
brea&s;t, &s;ome benevolent affections are found;
and con&s;cience &s;till retains a &s;en&s;e of the
di&s;tinction between moral good and evil.
The&s;e principles of virtue are always &s;u&s;|ceptible
of improvement; and, in favour|able
<PB N="109" REF="118">
&s;ituations, might have a happy in|fluence
on practice. But &s;uch is the frail|ty
of our nature, and &s;o numerous are the
temptations to evil, that they are in perpe|tual
hazard of being either totally effaced,
or &s;o far weakened as to produce no effect
on conduct. They are good &s;eeds original|ly
&s;own in the heart; but which require
culture, in order to make them ri&s;e to any
maturity. If left without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they
are likely to be &s;tifled by that profu&s;ion of
noxious weeds which the &s;oil &s;ends forth
around them.</P>
<P>Among the numerous cau&s;es which in|troduce
corruption into the heart, and ac|celerate
its growth, none is more unhappily
powerful than that which is pointed out in
the text, under the de&s;cription of <HI>evil com|munications;</HI>
that is, the contagion which is
diffu&s;ed by bad examples, and heightened
by particular connections with per&s;ons of
loo&s;e principles, or di&s;&s;olute morals. This,
in a licentious &s;tate of &s;ociety, is the mo&s;t
common &s;ource of tho&s;e vices and di&s;orders
which &s;o much abound in great cities;
<PB N="110" REF="119">
and often proves, in particular manner, fa|tal
to the young; even to them who&s;e be|ginnings
were once au&s;picious and promi|&s;ing.
It may therefore be an u&s;eful em|ployment
of attention, to trace the progre&s;s
of this principle of corruption; to examine
the means by which <HI>evil communications</HI> gra|dually
undermine, and at la&s;t de&s;troy <HI>good
manners,</HI> or (which here is the proper &s;ig|nification
of the original word) <HI>good morals.</HI>
It is indeed di&s;agreeable to contemplate hu|man
nature, in this downward cour&s;e of its
progre&s;s. But it is always profitable to
know our own infirmities and dangers.
The con&s;ideration of them will lead me to
&s;ugge&s;t &s;ome of the means proper to be u|&s;ed,
for preventing the mi&s;chiefs ari&s;ing
from <HI>evil communications.</HI></P>
<P>AGREEABLY to what I ob&s;erved of cer|tain
virtuous principles being inherent in
human nature, there are few but who &s;et
out at fir&s;t on the world with good di&s;po&s;i|tions.
The warmth which belongs to youth
naturally exerts it&s;elf in generous feelings,
<PB N="111" REF="120">
and &s;entiments of honour; in &s;trong at|tachment
to friends, and the other emo|tions
of a kind and tender heart. Almo&s;t
all the plans with which per&s;ons who have
been liberally educated begin the world, are
connected with honourable views. At that
period, they repudiate whatever is mean
or ba&s;e. It is plea&s;ing to them to think, of
commanding the e&s;teem of tho&s;e among
whom they live, and of acquiring a name
among men. But alas! how &s;oon does this
flattering pro&s;pect begin to be overca&s;t!
De&s;ires of plea&s;ure u&s;her in temptation, and
forward the growth of di&s;orderly pa&s;&s;ions.
Mini&s;ters of vice are &s;eldom wanting to en|courage,
and flatter, the pa&s;&s;ions of the
young. Inferiors &s;tudy to creep into fa|vour,
by &s;ervile ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s to all their
de&s;ires and humours. Glad to find any
apology for the indulgences of which they
are fond, the young too readily li&s;ten to the
voice of tho&s;e who &s;ugge&s;t to them, that
&s;trict notions of religion, order, and vir|tue,
are old fa&s;hioned and illiberal; that
the re&s;traints which they impo&s;e are only
<PB N="112" REF="121">
fit to be prescribed to tho&s;e who are in the
fir&s;t &s;tage of pupillage; or to be preached
to the vulgar, who ought to be kept within
the clo&s;e&s;t bounds of regularity and &s;ubjec|tion.
But the goodne&s;s of their hearts, it
is in&s;inuated to them, and the liberality of
their views, will fully ju&s;tify their emanci|pating
them&s;elves, in &s;ome degree, from
the rigid di&s;cipline of parents and teachers.</P>
<P>Soothing as &s;uch insinuations are to the
youthful, and incon&s;iderate, their fir&s;t &s;teps,
however, in vice, are cautious and timid,
and occa&s;ionally checked by remor&s;e. As
they begin to mingle more in the world,
and emerge into the circles of gaiety and
plea&s;ure, finding the&s;e loo&s;e ideas counte|nanced
by too general practice, they gra|dually
become bolder in the liberties they
take. If they have been bred to bu&s;ine&s;s,
they begin to tire of indu&s;try, and look
with contempt on the plodding race of citi|zens.
If they be of &s;uperior rank, they
think it becomes them to re&s;emble their e|quals;
to a&s;&s;ume that freedom of beha|viour,
that air of forwardne&s;e, that tone of
<PB N="113" REF="122">
di&s;&s;ipation, that ea&s;y negligence of tho&s;e
with whom they conver&s;e, which appear
fa&s;hionable in high life. If affluence of
fortune unhappily concur to favour their
inclinations, amu&s;ements and diversions
&s;ucceed in a perpetual round; night and
day are confounded; gaming fills up their
vacant intervals; they live wholly in public
places; they run into many degrees of ex|ce&s;s,
di&s;agreeable even to them&s;elves, mere|ly
from weak complai&s;ance, and the fear of
being ridiculed by their loo&s;e a&s;&s;ociates.
Among the&s;e a&s;&s;ociates, the mo&s;t hardened
and determined always take the lead. The
re&s;t follow them with implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion;
and make proficiency in this &s;chool of ini|quity,
in exact proportion to the weakne&s;s
of their under&s;tandings, and the &s;trength
of their pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>How many pa&s;s away, after this manner,
&s;ome of the mo&s;t valuable years of their
life, to&s;t in a whirlpool of what cannot be
called plea&s;ure, &s;o much as mere giddine&s;s
and folly? In the habits of perpetual con|nection
with idle or licentious company,
<PB N="114" REF="123">
all reflection is lo&s;t; while, circulated from
one empty head, and one thoughtle&s;s heart,
to another, folly &s;hoots up into all its mo&s;t
ridiculous forms; prompts the extravagant,
unmeaning frolic in private; or &s;allics forth
in public into mad riot; impelled &s;ome|times
by intoxication, &s;ometimes by mere
levity of &s;pirits.</P>
<P>All the while, amid&s;t this whole cour&s;e
of juvenile infatuation, I readily admit, that
much good nature may &s;till remain. Ge|nero&s;ity
and attachments may be found;
nay, &s;ome awe of religion may &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t,
and &s;ome remains of tho&s;e good impre&s;&s;ions
which were made upon the mind in early
days. It might yet be very po&s;&s;ible to re|claim
&s;uch per&s;ons, and to form them for
u&s;eful and re&s;pectable &s;tations in the world,
if virtuous and improving &s;ociety &s;hould
happily &s;ucceed to the place of that idle
crew with whom they now a&s;&s;ociate; if
important bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould occur, to bring
them into a different &s;phere of action; or,
if &s;ome &s;ea&s;onable &s;troke of affliction &s;hould
in mercy be &s;ent, to recall them to them|&s;elves,
<PB N="115" REF="124">
and to awaken &s;erious and manly
thought. But, if youth and vigour, and
flowing fortune continue; if a &s;imilar &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of companions go on to amu&s;e them,
to ingro&s;s their time, and to &s;tir up their
pa&s;&s;ions; the day of ruin,&mdash;let them take
heed, and beware!&mdash;the day of irrecover|able
ruin, begins to draw nigh. Fortune
is &s;quandered; health is broken; friends
are offended, affronted, e&s;tranged; aged
parents, perhaps, &s;ent afflicted and mourn|ing,
to the du&s;t.</P>
<P>There are certain degrees of vice which
are chiefly &s;tamped with the character of
the ridiculous, and the contemptible: and
there are al&s;o certain limits, beyond which
if it pa&s;s, it becomes odious and execra|ble.
If, to other corruptions which the
heart has already received, be added the
infu&s;ion of &s;ceptical principles, that wor&s;t
of all the <HI>evil communications</HI> of &s;inners, the
whole of morals is then on the point of
being overthrown. For, every crime can
then be palliated to con&s;cience; every check
and re&s;traint which had hitherto remained,
<PB N="116" REF="125">
is taken away. He who, in the beginning
of his cour&s;e, &s;oothed him&s;elf with the
thought, that while he indulged his de|&s;ires,
he did hurt to no man; now, pre&s;&s;ed
by the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upplying tho&s;e wants
into which his expen&s;ive pleasures have
brought him, goes on without remor&s;e to
defraud, and to oppre&s;s. The lover of plea|&s;ure,
now becomes hardened and cruel;
violates his tru&s;t, or betrays his friend; be|comes
a man of treachery, or a man of
blood; &s;atisfying, or at lea&s;t endeavouring
all the while to &s;atisfy him&s;elf, that circum|&s;tances
form his excu&s;e; that by nece&s;&s;ity
he is impelled; and that, in gratifying the
pa&s;&s;ions which nature had implanted within
him, he does no more than follow nature.</P>
<P>Mi&s;erable and deluded man! to what
art thou come at the la&s;t? Do&s;t thou
pretend to follow nature, when thou art
contemning the laws of the God of nature?
when thou art &s;tifling his voice within
thee, which remon&s;trates again&s;t thy crimes?
when thou art violating the be&s;t part of
thy nature, by counteracting the dictates
<PB N="117" REF="126">
of ju&s;tice and humanity? Do&s;t thou fol|low
nature, when thou rendere&s;t thy&s;elf an
u&s;ele&s;s animal on the earth; and not u&s;e|le&s;s
only, but noxious to the &s;ociety to
which thou belonge&s;t, and to which thou
art a di&s;grace; noxious, by the bad ex|ample
thou ha&s;t &s;et; noxious, by the crimes
thou ha&s;t committed; &s;acrificing innocence
to thy guilty plea&s;ures, and introducing
&s;hame and ruin into the habitations of

THIS brings me to what I propo&s;ed

in time the progre&s;s of &s;uch mi&s;chiefs; to
point out &s;ome remedies again&s;t the fatal
infection of <HI>evil communications.</HI></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t and mo&s;t obvious is, to with|draw
from all a&s;&s;ociations with bad men,
with per&s;ons either of licentious principles,
or of disorderly conduct. I have &s;hown to
what i&s;&s;ue &s;uch dangerous connections are
apt to bring men at la&s;t. Nothing, there|fore,
is of more importance for the young,
to whom I now chiefly addre&s;s my&s;elf, than
to be careful in the choice of their friends
and companions. This choice is too fre|quently
made without much thought, or
is determined by &s;ome ca&s;ual connection;
and yet, very often, the whole fate of their
future life depends upon it. The circum|&s;tances
which chiefly attract the liking and
the friend&s;hip of youth, are vivacity, good
humour, engaging manners, and a cheer|ful
or ea&s;y temper; qualities, I confe&s;s, a|miable
<PB N="119" REF="128">
in them&s;elves, and u&s;eful and va|luable
in their place. But I intreat you to
remember, that the&s;e are not all the quali|ties
requi&s;ite to form an intimate compa|nion
or friend. Something more is &s;till to
he looked for; a &s;ound under&s;tanding, a
&s;teady mind, a firm attachment to prin|ciple,
to virtue, and honour. As only &s;o|lid
bodies poli&s;h well, it is only on the &s;ub|&s;tantial
ground of the&s;e manly endowments,
that the other amiable qualities can receive
their proper lu&s;tre. De&s;titute of the&s;e e&s;|&s;ential
requi&s;ites, they &s;hine with no more
than a tin&s;el brilliancy. It may &s;parkle for
a little, amid&s;t a few circles of the frivolous,
and &s;uperficial; but it impo&s;es not on the
di&s;cernment of the public. The world in
general &s;eldom, after a &s;hort trial, judges
ami&s;s of the characters of men. You may
be a&s;&s;ured, that its character of you will be
formed by the company you frequent; and
how agreeable &s;oever they may &s;eem to be,
if nothing is to be found among them but
hollow qualities, and external accompli&s;h|ments,
they &s;oon fall down into the cla&s;s,
<PB N="120" REF="129">
at be&s;t, of the in&s;ignificant, perhaps of the
worthle&s;s; and you &s;ink of cour&s;e, in the
opinion of the public, into the &s;ame de&s;pi|cable
rank.</P>
<P>Allow me to warn you, that the mo&s;t
gay and plea&s;ing, are &s;ometimes the mo&s;t
in&s;idious and dangerous companions; an
admonition which re&s;pects both the &s;exes.
Often they attach them&s;elves to you from
intere&s;ted motives; and if any taint or &s;u&s;pi|cion
lie on their character, under the cover
of your rank, your fortune, or your good
reputation, they &s;eek protection for them|&s;elves.
Look round you, then, with atten|tive
eye, and weigh characters well before
you connect your&s;elves too clo&s;ely with any
who court your &s;ociety. <HI>He that walketh
with wi&s;e men &s;hall be wi&s;e; but a companion
of fools &s;hall be de&s;troyed.</HI> Wherefore, <HI>enter
not thou into the coun&s;el of the &s;corner. Walk
not in the way with evil men; avoid it; pa&s;s
not by it, turn from it, and pa&s;s away</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiii. 20.; Prov. iv. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="130">
IN order to prevent the influence of <HI>evil
communications,</HI> it is farther needful, that
you fix to your&s;elves certain principles of
conduct, and be re&s;olved and determined
on no occa&s;ion to &s;werve from them. Set|ting
the con&s;ideration of religion and vir|tue
a&s;ide, and attending merely to intere&s;t
and reputation, it will be found, that he
who enters on active life without having
a&s;certained &s;ome regular plan, according to
which he is to guide him&s;elf, will be un|pro&s;perous
in the whole of his &s;ub&s;equent
progre&s;s. But when conduct is viewed in
a moral and religious light, the effect of
having fixed no principles of action; of
having formed no laudable &s;tandard of
character, becomes more obviou&s;ly fatal.
For hence it is, that the young and thought|le&s;s
imbibe &s;o readily the poi&s;on of <HI>evil
communications,</HI> and fall a prey to every &s;e|ducer.
They have no internal guide whom
they are accu&s;tomed to follow and obey; no|thing
within them&s;elves, that can give firm|ne&s;s
to their conduct. They are of cour&s;e
the victims of momentary inclination or
<PB N="122" REF="131">
caprice; religious and good by &s;tarts,
when, during the ab&s;ence of temptation
and tempters, the virtuous principle &s;tirs
within them; but never long the &s;ame;
changing and fluctuating according to the
pa&s;&s;ion that chances to ri&s;e, or the in&s;tiga|tion
of tho&s;e with whom they have con|nected
them&s;elves. They are &s;ailing on a
dangerous &s;ea, which abounds with rocks;
without compa&s;s, by which to direct their
cour&s;e, or helm, by which to guide the ve&s;|&s;el.
Whereas, if they acted on a &s;y&s;tem,
if their behaviour made it appear that they
were determined to conduct them&s;elves by
certain rules and principles, not only would
they e&s;cape innumerable dangers, but they
would command re&s;pect from the licenti|ous
them&s;elves. Evil doers would cea&s;e to
lay their &s;nares for one whom they &s;aw
moving above them, in a higher &s;phere,
and with a more &s;teady cour&s;e.</P>
<P>As a farther corrective of <HI>evil communi|cations,</HI>
and as a foundation to tho&s;e prin|ciples
which you lay down for conduct,
<PB N="123" REF="132">
let me advi&s;e you &s;ometimes to think &s;e|riou&s;ly,
of what con&s;titutes real enjoyment
and happine&s;s. Your days cannot be en|tirely
&s;pent in company and plea&s;ure.
How clo&s;ely &s;oever you are &s;urrounded and
be&s;ieged by evil companions, there mu&s;t
be &s;ome intervals, in which you are left by
your&s;elves; when, after all the turbulence
of amu&s;ement is over, your mind will na|turally
a&s;&s;ume a graver and more pen&s;ive
ca&s;t. The&s;e are precious intervals to you,
if you knew their value. Seize that &s;ober
hour of retirement and &s;ilence. Indulge
the meditations which then begin to ri&s;e.
Ca&s;t your eye backwards on what is pa&s;t
of your life; look forward to what is pro|bably
to came. Think of the part you
are now acting; and of what remains to
be acted, perhaps to be &s;uffered, before you
die. Then is the time to form your plans
of happine&s;s, not merely for the next day,
but for the general cour&s;e of your life.
Remember, that what is plea&s;ing to you at
twenty, will not be equally &s;o at forty or
fifty years of age; and that what continues
<PB N="124" REF="133">
longe&s;t plea&s;ing, is always mo&s;t valuable.
Recollect your own feelings in different
&s;cenes of life. Inquire on what occa&s;ions
you have felt the true&s;t &s;atisfaction; whe|ther
days of &s;obriety, and rational employ|ment,
have not left behind them a more a|greeable
remembrance, that nights of li|centiou&s;ne&s;s
and riot. Look round you on
the world; reflect on the different &s;ocie|ties
which have fallen under your ob&s;er|vation;
and think who among them ap|pear
to enjoy life to mo&s;t advantage; whe|ther
they who, encircled by gay compa|nions,
are con&s;tantly fatiguing them&s;elves
in que&s;t of plea&s;ure; of they to whom plea|&s;ure
comes un&s;ought, in the cour&s;e of an
active, virtuous, and manly life. Compare
together the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es of mankind, and
a&s;k your own hearts, to which of them
you would chu&s;e to belong. If, in a hap|py
moment, the light of truth begin to
break in upon you, refu&s;e not admittance
to the ray. If your hearts &s;ecretly re|proach
you for the worng choice you have
made, bethink your&s;elves that the evil is
<PB N="125" REF="134">
not irreparable. Still there is time for re|pentance
and retreat; and a return to wi&s;|dom,
is always honourable.</P>
<P>Were &s;uch meditations often indulged,
the <HI>evil communications</HI> of &s;inners would die
away before them; the force of their poi|&s;on
would evaporate; the world would be|gin
to a&s;&s;ume in your eyes a new form
and &s;hape. Di&s;dain not, in the&s;e &s;olitary
hours, to recollect what the wi&s;e&s;t have
&s;aid, and have written, concerning human
happine&s;s, and human vanity. Treat not
their opinions, as effu&s;ions merely of pee|vi&s;hne&s;s
or di&s;appointment: but believe
them to be, what they truly are, the re&s;ult
of long experience, and thorough acquaint|ance
with the world. Con&s;ider that the
&s;ea&s;on of youth is pa&s;&s;ing fa&s;t away. It
is time for you to be taking mea&s;ures for
an e&s;tabli&s;hment in life; nay, it were wi&s;e
to be looking forward to a placid enjoy|ment
of old age. That is a period you
wi&s;h to &s;ee; but how mi&s;erable when it
arrives, if it yield you nothing but the
dregs of life; and pre&s;ent no retro&s;pect,
<PB N="126" REF="135">
except that of a thoughtle&s;s, and di&s;ho|noured
youth!</P>
<P>LET me once more advi&s;e you, to look
forward &s;ometimes beyond old age; to
look to a future world. Amid&s;t <HI>evil commu|nications,</HI>
let your belief, and your character
as Chri&s;tians, ari&s;e to your view. Think
of the &s;acred name in which you were
baptized. Think of the God whom your
fathers honoured and wor&s;hipped; of the
religion in which they trained you up; of
the venerable rites in which they brought
you to partake. Their paternal cares have
now cea&s;ed. They have fini&s;hed their
earthly cour&s;e: and the time is coming
when you mu&s;t follow them. You know
that you are not to live always here; and
you &s;urely do not believe that your exi&s;t|ence
is to end with this life. Into what
world then are you next to go? Whom
will you meet with there? Before who&s;e
tribunal are you to appear? What account
will you be able to give of your pre&s;ent
trifling and irregular conduct to him who
<PB N="127" REF="136">
made you?&mdash;Such thoughts may be treat|ed
as un&s;ea&s;onable intru&s;ions. But intrude
they &s;ometimes will, whether you make
them welcome or not. Better then, to al|low
them free reception when they come,
and to con&s;ider fairly to what they lead.
You have &s;een per&s;ons die; at lea&s;t, you
have heard of your friends dying near you.
Did it never enter into your minds, to
think what their la&s;t reflections probably
were in their concluding moments; or
what your own, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, would
be? What would be then your hopes and
fears; what part you would then wi&s;h to
have acted; in what light your clo&s;ing
eyes would then view this life, and this
world?</P>
<P>The&s;e are thoughts, my friends, too im|portant
to be always excluded. The&s;e are
things too &s;olemn and awful to be trifled
with. They are &s;uperior to all the ridicule
of fools. They come home to every man's
bo&s;om; and are intitled to every man's
highe&s;t attention. Let us regard them as
becomes rea&s;onable and mortal creatures;
<PB N="128" REF="137">
and they will prove effectual antidotes to
the <HI>evil communications</HI> of petulant &s;coffers.
When vice of folly ari&s;e to tempt us un|der
flattering forms, let the &s;erious charac|ter
which we bear as men come al&s;o for|ward
to view; and let the &s;olemn admo|nitions,
with which I conclude, &s;ound full
in our ears: <HI>My &s;on, if &s;inners entice thee,
con&s;ent thou not. Come out from among&s;t
them, and be &s;eparate. Remember thy Crea|tor

our &s;ky &s;eems mo&s;t &s;ettled and &s;erene, in
&s;ome unob&s;erved quarter gathers the little
black cloud, in which the tempe&s;t ferments,
and prepares to di&s;charge it&s;elf on our head.
Such is the real &s;ituation of man in this
world; and he who flatters him&s;elf with an
oppo&s;ite view of his &s;tate, only lives in the
paradi&s;e of fools.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, no quality is more re|qui&s;ite
than con&s;tancy, or fortitude of
mind; a quality which the P&s;almi&s;t ap|pears,
from the &s;entiment in the text, to
have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in an eminent degree. For|titude
was ju&s;tly cla&s;&s;ed by the ancient
philo&s;ophers, among the cardinal virtues.
It is indeed e&s;&s;ential to the &s;upport of them
all; and is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be acquired
by every one who wi&s;hes to di&s;charge with
fidelity the duties of his &s;tation. It is the
armour of the mind, which will fit him
for encountering the trials, and &s;urmount|ing
the dangers, that are likely to occur in
the cour&s;e of his life. It may be thought,
<PB N="131" REF="140">
perhaps, to be a quality, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
con&s;titutional; dependent on firmne&s;s of
nerves, and &s;trength of &s;pirits. Though,
partly, it is &s;o, yet experience &s;hows that
it may al&s;o be acquired by principle, and
be fortified by rea&s;on; and it is only when
thus acquired, and thus fortified, that it
can be accounted to carry the character of
virtue. Fortitude is oppo&s;ed, as all know,
to timidity, irre&s;olution, a feeble and a
wavering &s;pirit. It is placed, like other
virtues, in the middle between two ex|tremes;
&s;tanding at an equal di&s;tance from
ra&s;hne&s;s on the one hand, and from pu&s;il|lanimity
on the other. In di&s;cour&s;ing on
this &s;ubject, I purpo&s;e, fir&s;t, to &s;how the
importance of fortitude or con&s;tancy; next,
to a&s;certain the grounds on which it mu&s;t
re&s;t; and, la&s;tly, to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome con&s;idera|tions
for a&s;&s;i&s;ting the exerci&s;e of it.</P>
<P>I. THE high importance of fortitude will
ea&s;ily appear, if we con&s;ider it as re&s;pect|ing
either the happine&s;s of human life, or
the proper di&s;charge of its duties.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="141">
Without &s;ome degree of fortitude there
can be no happine&s;s: becau&s;e, amid&s;t the
thou&s;and uncertainties of life, there can be
no enjoyment of tranquility. The man
of feeble and timorous &s;pirit, lives under
perpetual alarms. He fore&s;ees every di&s;tant
danger, and trembles. He explores the re|gions
of po&s;&s;ibility, to di&s;cover the dangers
that may ari&s;e. Often he creates imaginary
ones; always magnifies tho&s;e that are real.
Hence, like a per&s;on haunted by &s;pectres,
he lo&s;es the free enjoyment even of a &s;afe
and pro&s;perous &s;tate. On the fir&s;t &s;hock of
adver&s;ity, he de&s;ponds. In&s;tead of exerting
him&s;elf to lay hold on the re&s;ources that
remain, he gives up all for lo&s;t; and re|&s;igns
him&s;elf to abject and broken &s;pirits.
&mdash;On the other hand, firmne&s;s of mind is
the parent of tranquility. It enables one
to enjoy the pre&s;ent without di&s;turbance;
and to look calmly on dangers that ap|proach,
or evils that threaten in future. It
&s;ugge&s;ts good hopes. It &s;upplies re&s;ources.
It allows a man to retain the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of him&s;elf, in every &s;ituation of fortune.
Look into the heart of this man, and you
<PB N="133" REF="142">
will find compo&s;ure, cheerfulne&s;s, and mag|nanimity.
Look into the heart of the other,
and you will &s;ee nothing but confu&s;ion,
anxiety, and trepidation. The one is the
ca&s;tle built on a rock, which defies the at|tacks
of &s;urrounding waters. The other
is a hut placed on the &s;hore, which every
wind &s;hakes, and every wave overflows.</P>
<P>IF fortitude be thus e&s;&s;ential to the enjoy|ment
of life, it is equally &s;o, to the proper
di&s;charge of all its mo&s;t important duties.
He who is of a cowardly mind is, and
mu&s;t be, a &s;lave to the world. He fa&s;hions
his whole conduct according to its hopes
and fears. He &s;miles, and fawns, and be|trays,
from abject con&s;iderations of per&s;onal
&s;afety. He is incapable of either concei|ving,
or executing, any great de&s;ign. He
can neither &s;tand the clamour of the mul|titude,
nor the frowns of the mighty. The
wind of popular favour, of the threats of
power, are &s;ufficient to &s;hake his mo&s;t
determined purpo&s;e. The world always
knows where to find him. He may pretend
<PB N="134" REF="143">
to have principles; but on every trying oc|ca&s;ion,
it will be &s;een, that his pretended
principles bend to convenience and &s;afety.
&mdash;The man of virtuous fortitude, again,
follows the dictates of his heart, unembar|ra&s;&s;ed
by tho&s;e re&s;traints which lie upon
the timorous. Having once determined
what is fit for him to do, no threatenings
can &s;hake, nor dangers appall him. He
re&s;ts upon him&s;elf, &s;upported by a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of inward dignity. I do not &s;ay
that this di&s;po&s;ition alone, will &s;ecure him
again&s;t every vice. He may be lifted up
with pride. He may be &s;educed by plea|&s;ure.
He may be hurried away by pa&s;&s;ion.
But at lea&s;t on one quarter, he will be &s;afe;
by no abject fears mi&s;led into evil.</P>
<P>Without this temper of mind, no man
can be a thorough Chri&s;tian. For his pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
as &s;uch, requires him to be &s;upe|rior
to that <HI>fear of man which bringeth a
&s;nare;</HI> enjoins him, for the &s;ake of a good
con&s;cience, to encounter every danger; and
to be prepared, if called, even to lay down
his life in the cau&s;e of religion and truth.
<PB N="135" REF="144">
All who have been di&s;tingui&s;hed as &s;er|vants
of God, or benefactors of men; all
who, in perilous &s;ituations, have acted their
part with &s;uch honour as to render their
names illu&s;trious through &s;ucceeding ages,
have been eminent for fortitude of mind.
Of this we have one con&s;picuous example in
the Apo&s;tle Paul, whom it will be in&s;truc|tive
for us to view in a remarkable occur|rence
of his life. After having long acted
as the apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, his mi&s;&s;ion
called him to go to Jeru&s;alem, where he
knew that he was to encounter the utmo&s;t
violence of his enemies. Ju&s;t before he &s;et
&s;ail, he called together the elders of his
favourite church at Ephe&s;us, and in a pa|thetic
&s;peech, which does great honour to
his character, gave them his la&s;t farewel.
Deeply affected by their knowledge of the
certain dangers to which he was expo&s;ing
him&s;elf, all the a&s;&s;embly were filled with
di&s;tre&s;s, and melted into tears. The cir|cum&s;tances
were &s;uch, as might have con|veyed
dejection even into a re&s;olute mind;
and would have totally overwhelmed the
<PB N="136" REF="145">
feeble. <HI>They all wept fore, and fell on Paul's
neck, and ki&s;&s;ed him; &s;orrowing mo&s;t of all
for the words which he &s;pake, that they &s;hould
&s;ee his face no more.</HI> What were then the
&s;entiments, what was the language, of this
great and good man? Hear the words
which &s;poke his firm and undaunted
mind. <HI>Behold, I go bound in the &s;pirit, un|to
Jeru&s;alem, not knowing the things that
&s;hall befall me there; &s;ave that the Holy
Gho&s;t witne&s;&s;eth in every city, &s;aying, that
bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of
the&s;e things move me; neither count I my life
dear unto my&s;elf, &s;o that I might fini&s;h my
cour&s;e with joy, and the mini&s;try which I
have received of the Lord Je&s;us, to te&s;tify the
go&s;pel of the grace of God</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Acts xx. 22. 23. 24.; 37. 38.</NOTE>. There was ut|tered
the voice, there breathed the &s;pirit, of
a brave, and a virtuous man. Such a man
knows not what it is to &s;hrink from dan|ger,
when con&s;cience points out his path.
In that path he is determined to walk; let
the con&s;equences be what they will. <HI>Till
<PB N="137" REF="146">
I die, I will not remove my integrity from me.
My righteou&s;ne&s;s I hold fa&s;t, and will not let
it go. My heart &s;hall not reproach me &s;o long
as I live</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job xxvii. 5. 6.</NOTE>. &startq;For me, there is a part ap|pointed
to act. I go to perform it. My
duty I &s;hall do to-day. Let <HI>to-morrow
take thought for the things of it&s;elf.&endq;</HI>&mdash;
Having thus &s;hown the importance, I pro|ceed,</P>
<P>II. To &s;how the proper foundations of
con&s;tancy and fortitude of mind. They
are principally two; a good con&s;cience,
and tru&s;t in God.</P>
<P>A corrupted and guilty man, can po&s;&s;e&s;s
no true firmne&s;s of heart. He who by
crooked paths, pur&s;ues di&s;honourable ends,
has many things to di&s;may him. He not
only dreads the di&s;appointment of his de|&s;igns,
by &s;ome of tho&s;e accidents to which
all are expo&s;ed; but he has al&s;o to dread
the treachery of his confederates, the di&s;|covery
and reproach of the world, and the
<PB N="138" REF="147">
ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure of Heaven. His fears he
is obliged to conceal; but while he a&s;&s;umes
the appearance of intrepidity before the
world, he trembles within him&s;elf; and
the bold and &s;teady eye of integrity, fre|quently
darts terror into his heart. There
is, it is true, a &s;ort of con&s;titutional cou|rage,
which &s;ometimes has rendered men
daring in the mo&s;t flagitious attempts.
But this fool-hardine&s;s of the ra&s;h, this
boldne&s;s of the ru&s;&s;ian, is altogether differ|ent
from real fortitude. It ari&s;es merely
from warmth of blood, from want of
thought, and blindne&s;s to danger. As it
forms no character of value, &s;o it appears
only in occa&s;ional &s;allies; and never can be
uniformily maintained. It requires adven|titious
props to &s;upport it; and in &s;ome
hour of trial, always fails. There can be
no true courage, no regular per&s;evering
con&s;tancy, but what is connected with
principle, and founded on a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of rectitude of intention. This, and this
only, erects that brazen wall which we can
oppo&s;e to every ho&s;tile attack. It cloaths
<PB N="139" REF="148">
us with an armour, on which fortune will
&s;pend its &s;hafts in vain. All is found
within. There is no weak place, where we
particularly dread a blow. There is no
occa&s;ion for fal&s;e colours to be hung out.
No di&s;gui&s;e is needed to cover us. We
would be &s;ati&s;fied if all mankind could
look into our hearts. What has he to
fear, who not acts on a plan which
his con&s;cience approves, but who knows
that every good man, nay, the whole un|bia&s;&s;ed
world, if they could trace his in|tentions,
would ju&s;tify and approve his
conduct?</P>
<P>HE knows, at the &s;ame time, that he is act|ing
under the immediate eye and protec|tion
of the Almighty. <HI>Behold my witne&s;s is
in heaven; and my record is on high</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job xvi. 19.</NOTE>. Here
opens a new &s;ource of fortitude to every
virtuous man. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch
an illu&s;trious &s;pectator, invigorates and ani|mates
him. He tru&s;ts, that the eternal lo|ver
<PB N="140" REF="149">
of righteou&s;ne&s;s not only beholds and
approves, but will &s;trengthen and a&s;&s;i&s;t;
will not &s;uffer him to be unju&s;tly oppre&s;&s;ed,
and will reward his con&s;tancy in the end,
with glory, honour, and immortality. A
good con&s;cience, thus &s;upported, be&s;tows
on the heart a much greater degree of intre|pidity,
than it could otherwi&s;e in&s;pire. One
who re&s;ts on an Almighty, though invi&s;ible,
Protector, exerts his powers with double
force; acts with vigour not his own. Ac|cordingly,
it was from this principle of
tru&s;t in God, that the P&s;almi&s;t derived that
courage and boldne&s;s, which he expre&s;&s;es
in the text. He had &s;aid immediately be|fore,
<HI>The Lord is my light and my &s;alvation;
the Lord is the &s;trength of my life.</HI> The con|&s;equence
which directly follows is, <HI>of whom
&s;hall I be afraid? Though an ho&s;t &s;hould en|camp
again&s;t me, my heart &s;hall not fear.</HI> It
remains,</P>
<P>III. THAT I &s;ugge&s;t a few con&s;iderations
which may prove auxiliary to the exerci&s;e
<PB N="141" REF="150">
of virtuous fortitude, in the mid&s;t of dan|gers.</P>
<P>From what was ju&s;t now &s;aid, it appears,
fir&s;t, that it is of high importance to every
one who wi&s;hes to act his part with be|coming
re&s;olution, to cultivate a religious
principle, and to be in&s;pired with tru&s;t in
God. The imperfections of the be&s;t are
indeed &s;o numerous, as to give them no
title to claim, on their own account, the
protection of Heaven. But we are taught
to believe, that the merciful God, who made
us, and who <HI>knows our frame,</HI> favours the
&s;incere and upright; that the &s;upreme ad|mini&s;tration
of the univer&s;e is always on
the &s;ide of truth and virtue; and, that,
therefore, every worthy character, and eve|ry
ju&s;t and good cau&s;e, though for a while
it &s;hould be depre&s;&s;ed, is likely to receive
countenance and protection in the end.
The more firmly this belief is rooted in
the heart, its influence will be more power|ful,
in &s;urmounting the fears which ari&s;e
from a &s;en&s;e of our own weakne&s;s or dan|ger.
The records of all nations afford a
<PB N="142" REF="151">
thou&s;and remarkable in&s;tances of the ef|fect
of this principle, both on individuals,
and on bodies of men. Animated by the
&s;trong belief of a ju&s;t cau&s;e, and a pro|tecting
God, the <HI>feeble have waxed &s;trong,</HI>
and have de&s;pi&s;ed dangers, &s;ufferings,
and death. Handfuls of men have defied
<HI>ho&s;ts that were encamped again&s;t them;</HI> and
have gone forth, conquering and to con|quer.
<HI>The &s;word of the Lord, and of Gi|deon,</HI>
have called forth a valour which a|&s;toni&s;hed
the world; and which could have
been exerted by none, but tho&s;e who fought
under a divine banner.</P>
<P>IN the next place, let him who would
pre&s;erve fortitude in difficult &s;ituations, fill
his mind with a &s;en&s;e, of what con&s;titutes
the true honour of man. It con&s;i&s;ts not in
the multitude of riches, or the elevation of
rank; for experience &s;hows, that the&s;e may
be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the worthle&s;s, as well as by
the de&s;erving. It con&s;i&s;ts, in being deterred
by no danger when duty calls us forth; in
fulfilling our allotted part, whatever it may
<PB N="143" REF="152">
be, with faithfulne&s;s, bravery, and con|&s;tancy
of mind. The&s;e qualities never fail
to &s;tamp di&s;tinction on the character. They
confer on him who di&s;covers them, an ho|nourable
&s;uperiority, which all, even ene|mies,
feel and revere. Let every man,
therefore, when the hour of danger comes,
bethink him&s;elf, that now is arrived the
hour of trial; the hour which mu&s;t deter|mine
whether he is to ri&s;e, or to &s;ink for
ever, in the e&s;teem of all around him. If,
when put to the re&s;t, he di&s;cover no firm|ne&s;s
to maintain his ground, no fortitude
to &s;tand a &s;hock, he has forfeited every
preten&s;ion to a manly mind. He mu&s;t
reckon on being expo&s;ed to general con|tempt;
and what is wor&s;e, he will feel that
he de&s;erves it. In his own eyes he will be
contemptible; than which, &s;urely, no mi|&s;ery
can be more &s;evere.</P>
<P>BUT in order to acquire habits of forti|tude,
what is of the highe&s;t con&s;equence
is, to have formed a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the
goods and evils of life, and of the value of
<PB N="144" REF="153">
life it&s;elf. For here lies the chief &s;ource of
our weakne&s;s and pu&s;illanimity. We over|value
the advantages of fortune; rank and
riches, ea&s;e and &s;afety. Deluded by vain
opinions, we look to the&s;e as our ultimate
goods. we hang upon them with fond at|tachment;
and to forfeit any hope of ad|vancement,
to incur the lea&s;t di&s;credit with
the world, or to be brought down but one
&s;tep from the &s;tation we po&s;&s;e&s;s, is regard|ed
with con&s;ternation and di&s;may. Hence,
a thou&s;and weights hang upon the mind,
which depre&s;s its courage, and bend it to
mean and di&s;honourable compliances. What
fortitude can he po&s;&s;e&s;, what worthy or
generous purpo&s;e can he form, who con|ceives
diminution of rank, or lo&s;s of for|tune,
to be the chief evils which man can
&s;uffer? Put the&s;e into the balance with
true honour, with con&s;cious integrity, with
the e&s;teem of the virtuous and the wi&s;e,
with the favour of Almighty God, with
peace of mind, and hope of heaven; and
then think, whether tho&s;e dreaded evils are
&s;ufficient to intimidate you from doing
<PB N="145" REF="154">
your duty. Look beyond external appear|ances
to the in&s;ide of things. Suffer not
your&s;elves to be impo&s;ed on by that glitter|ing
varni&s;h, with which the &s;urface of the
world dazzles the vulgar. Con&s;ider how
many are contented and happy without
tho&s;e advantages of fortune, on which you
put &s;o extravagant a value. Con&s;ider whe|ther
it is po&s;&s;ible for you to be happy with
them, if, for their &s;ake, you forfeit all that
is e&s;timable in man. The favour of the
great, perhaps, you think, is at &s;take; or
that popularity with the multitude, on
which you build plans of advancement.
Alas! how precarious are the means which
you employ in order to attain the end you
have in view; and the end it&s;elf, how little
is it worthy of your ambition? That fa|vour
which you pur&s;ue, of dubious advan|tage
when gained, is frequently lo&s;t by
&s;ervile compliance. The timid and abject
are detected, and de&s;pi&s;ed even by tho&s;e
whom they court; while the firm and re|&s;olute
ri&s;e in the end to tho&s;e honours,
which the other pur&s;ued in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="155">
PUT the ca&s;e at the wor&s;t. Suppo&s;e not
your fortune only, but your &s;afety, to be
in hazard; your life it&s;elf to be endanger|ed,
by adhering to con&s;cience and vir|tue.
Think, what a creeping and igno|minious
&s;tate you would render life, if,
when your duty calls, you would expo&s;e it
to no danger; if by a da&s;tardly behaviour,
you would, at any expence, pre&s;erve it.
That life, which you are &s;o anxious to pre|&s;erve,
can at any rate be prolonged only
for a few years more; and tho&s;e years may
be full of woe. He who will not ri&s;k death
when con&s;cience requires him to face it,
ought to be a&s;hamed to live.&mdash;Con&s;ider,
as a man and a Chri&s;tian, for what purpo&s;e
life was given thee by Heaven. Was it,
that thou mighte&s;t pa&s;s a few years in low
plea&s;ures, and ignoble &s;loth; flying into
every corner to hide thy&s;elf, when the lea&s;t
danger ri&s;es to view? No: Life was given,
that thou mighte&s;t come forth to act &s;ome
u&s;eful and honourable part, on that theatre
where thou ha&s;t been placed by Provi|dence;
mighte&s;t glorify him that made
<PB N="147" REF="156">
thee; and by &s;teady per&s;everance in virtue,
ri&s;e in the end to an immortal &s;tate.</P>
<P>Son of man! Remember thine original
honours. A&s;&s;ert the dignity of thy nature.
Shake off this pu&s;illanimous dread of death;
and &s;eek to fulfil the ends for which thou
wert &s;ent forth by thy Creator.&mdash;The
&s;entiment of a noble mind is, <HI>I count not
my life dear unto my&s;elf, &s;o that I may fini&s;h
my cour&s;e with joy.</HI> To the <HI>fini&s;hing of his
cour&s;e,</HI> let every one direct his eye; and let
him now appretiate life according to the
value it will be found to have, when &s;um|med
up at the clo&s;e. That is the period
which brings every thing to the te&s;t. Illu|&s;ions
may formerly have impo&s;ed on the
world; may have impo&s;ed on the man him|&s;elf.
But all illu&s;ion then vani&s;hes. The
real character comes forth. The e&s;timate
of happine&s;s is fairly formed. Hence it
has been ju&s;tly &s;aid, that no man can be
pronounced either great or happy, until his
la&s;t hour come. To that la&s;t hour, what
will bring &s;uch &s;atisfaction, or add &s;o much
dignity, as the reflection, on having &s;ur|mounted
<PB N="148" REF="157">
with firmne&s;s all the di&s;courage|ments
of the world, and having per&s;evered
to the end in one uniform cour&s;e of fidelity
and honour? We remarked before, the
magnanimous behaviour of the Apo&s;tle
Paul, when he had per&s;ecution and di&s;tre&s;s
full in view. Hear now the &s;entiments of
the &s;ame great man, when the time of his
la&s;t &s;uffering approached; and remark the
maje&s;ty, and the ea&s;e; with which he look|ed
on death. <HI>I am now ready to be offered,
and the time of my departure is at hand. I
have fought the good fight. I have fini&s;hed
my cour&s;e. I have kept the faith. Hence|forth
there is laid up for me a crown of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">2 Timothy, iv. 6. 7.</NOTE>.
How many years of life does
&s;uch a dying moment overbalance? Who
would not chu&s;e, in this manner, to go off
the &s;tage, with &s;uch a &s;ong of triumph in
his mouth, rather than prolong his exi&s;t|ence
through a wretched old age, &s;tained

which others are &s;uppo&s;ed to
po&s;&s;e&s;s above us, accompanied with ma|lignity
towards tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s them.
This is univer&s;ally admitted to be one of
the blacke&s;t pa&s;&s;ions in the human heart.
In this world, we depend much on one
another; and were therefore formed by
God to be mutually u&s;eful and a&s;&s;i&s;ting.
The in&s;tincts of kindne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion
which belong to our frame, &s;how how
<PB N="151" REF="160">
much it was the intention of our Creator,
that we &s;hould be united in friend&s;hip. If
any infringe this great law of nature, by
acts of cau&s;ele&s;s ho&s;tility, re&s;entment may
ju&s;tly ari&s;e. No one is to be condemned
for defending his rights, and &s;howing di&s;|plea&s;ure
again&s;t a malicious enemy. But
to conceive ill-will at one who has attacked
none of our rights, nor done us any inju|ry,
&s;olely becau&s;e he is more pro&s;perous
than we are, is a di&s;po&s;ition altogether un|natural;
it &s;uits not the human con&s;titu|tion,
and partakes more of the rancour of
an evil &s;pirit. Hence, the character of an
envious man is univer&s;ally odious. All di&s;|claim
it; and they who feel them&s;elves un|der
the influence of this pa&s;&s;ion, carefully
conceal it.</P>
<P>But it is proper to con&s;ider, that among
all our pa&s;&s;ions, both good and bad, there
are many different gradations. Sometimes
they &s;wim on the &s;urface of the mind,
without producing any internal agitation.
They proceed no farther than the begin|nings
of pa&s;&s;ion. Allayed by our con&s;ti|tution,
<PB N="152" REF="161">
or tempered by the mixture of other
di&s;po&s;itions, they exert no con&s;iderable in|fluence
on the temper. Though the cha|racter
in which envy forms the ruling pa&s;|&s;ion,
and reigns in all its force, be one too
odious, I hope, to be common; yet &s;ome
&s;hade, &s;ome tincture, of this evil di&s;po&s;i|tion,
mixes with mo&s;t characters in the
world. It is, perhaps, one of the mo&s;t pre|vailing
infirmities to which we are &s;ubject.
There are few but who, at one time or
other, have found &s;omewhat of this nature
&s;tirring within them; &s;ome lurking unea|&s;ine&s;s
in their mind, when they looked up
to others, who enjoyed a greater &s;hare than
had fallen to their lot, of &s;ome advantages
which they wi&s;hed, and thought them&s;elves
intitled, to po&s;&s;e&s;s. Though this &s;hould
not embitter their di&s;po&s;ition; though it
&s;hould create the unea&s;ine&s;s only, without
the malignity, of envy; yet &s;till it is a di&s;|turbed
&s;tate of mind; and always borders
upon, if it actually include not, &s;ome vi|cious
affections. In order, as far as po&s;|&s;ible,
to remedy this evil, I &s;hall now con|&s;ider
<PB N="153" REF="162">
what are the mo&s;t general grounds of
the envy which men are apt to bear to
others; and &s;hall examine what foundation
they afford, for any degree of this trouble|&s;ome
and dangerous pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;The chief
grounds of envy may be reduced to three:
Accompli&s;hments of mind; advantages of
birth, rank, and fortune; &s;uperior &s;ucce&s;s
in worldly pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>I. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, or endowments
of the mind. The chief endowment for
which man de&s;erves to be valued, is virtue.
This, unque&s;tionably, forms the mo&s;t e&s;ti|mable
di&s;tinction among mankind. Yet
this, which may appear &s;urpri&s;ing, never
forms any ground of envy. No man is
envied for being more ju&s;t, more generous,
more patient, or forgiving, than others.
This may, in part, be owing to virtue pro|ducing
in every one who beholds it, that
high degree of re&s;pect and love, which ex|tingui&s;hes
envy. But probably, it is more
owing to the good opinion which every
one entertains of his own moral qualities.
<PB N="154" REF="163">
Some virtues, or, at lea&s;t, the &s;eeds of them,
he finds within his brea&s;t. Others, he vain|ly
attributes to him&s;elf. Tho&s;e in which
he is plainly deficient, he undervalues; as
either not real virtues, or virtues of very
inferior rank; and re&s;ts &s;atisfied, that, on
the whole, he is as worthy and re&s;pectable
as his neighbour.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is different, with regard to tho&s;e
mental abilities and powers which are a|&s;cribed
to others. As long as the&s;e are ex|erted
in a &s;phere of action remote from
ours, and not brought into competition
with talents of the &s;ame kind, to which we
have preten&s;ions, they create no jealou&s;y.
They are viewed as di&s;tant objects, in
which we have not any concern. It is not
until they touch our own line, and appear
to rival us in what we wi&s;h to excel, that
they awaken envy. Even then, envy is,
properly &s;peaking, not grounded on the
talents of others. For here, too, our &s;elf-complacency
brings us relief; from the
per&s;ua&s;ion, that were we thoroughly known,
and full ju&s;tice done to us, our abilities
<PB N="155" REF="164">
would be found not inferior to tho&s;e of
our rivals. What properly occa&s;ions envy,
is the fruit of the accomplishments of
others; the pre-eminence which the opi|nion
of the world be&s;tows, or which we
dread it will be&s;tow, on their talents above
ours. Hence, di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;uperiority in
genius, learning, eloquence, or any other
of tho&s;e various arts that attract the no|tice
of the world, often become painful
grounds of envy; not indeed to all indif|ferently,
but to tho&s;e who follow the &s;ame
line of pur&s;uit. Mere rivality, in&s;pired by
emulation, would carry no reproach; were
not that rivality joined with obliquity, and
a malignant &s;pirit; did it not lead to &s;e|cret
detraction, and unfair methods of di|mini&s;hing
the reputation of others. Too
frequently has &s;uch a &s;pirit tarni&s;hed the
character of tho&s;e who &s;ought to &s;hine in
the elegant arts; and who, otherwi&s;e, had a
ju&s;t title to fame.&mdash;Let &s;uch as are ad|dicted
to this infirmity con&s;ider, how much
they degrade them&s;elves. Superior merit,
of any kind, always re&s;ts on it&s;elf. Con|&s;cious
<PB N="156" REF="165">
of what it de&s;erves, it di&s;dains low
competitions and jealou&s;ies. They who
are &s;tung with envy, especially when they
allow its malignity to appear, confe&s;s a &s;en&s;e
of their own inferiority; and, in effect, pay
homage to that merit from which they en|deavour
to detract.</P>
<P>But in order to eradicate the pa&s;&s;ion,
and to cure the di&s;quiet which it creates,
let &s;uch per&s;ons farther con&s;ider, how in|con&s;iderable
the advantage is which their
rivals have gained, by any &s;uperiority over
them. They whom you envy, are them|&s;elves
inferior to others who follow the
&s;ame pur&s;uits. For how few, how very
few, have reached the &s;ummit of excel|lence,
in the art or &s;tudy which they cul|tivate?
Even that degree of excellence
which they have attained, how &s;eldom is
it allowed to them by the world, till after
they die? Public applau&s;e is the mo&s;t fluc|tuating,
and uncertain, of all rewards. Ad|mired,
as they may be, by a circle of their
friends, they have to look up to others,
who &s;tand above them in public opinion;
<PB N="157" REF="166">
and undergo the &s;ame mortifications which
you &s;uffer in looking up to them. Con|&s;ider
what labour it has co&s;t them to arrive
at that degree of eminence they have gain|ed;
and after all their labour, how im|perfect
their recompence is at la&s;t. With|in
what narrow bounds is their fame con|fined?
With what a number of humilia|tions
is it mixed? To how many are they
ab&s;olutely unknown? Among tho&s;e who
know them, how many cen&s;ure and decry
them?&mdash;Attending fairly to the&s;e con&s;i|derations,
the envious might come in the
end to di&s;cern, that the fame acquired by
any accompli&s;hment of the mind, by all
that &s;kill can contrive, or genius can exe|cute,
amounts to no more than a &s;mall ele|vation;
rai&s;es rhe po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to &s;uch an in|con&s;iderable
height above the crowd, that
others may, without di&s;quiet, &s;it down con|tented
with their own mediocrity.</P>
<P>II. ADVANTAGES of fortune, &s;uperiority
in birth, rank and riches, even qualifica|tions
of body and form, become grounds
<PB N="158" REF="167">
of envy. Among external advantages,
tho&s;e which relate to the body ought cer|tainly,
in the comparative e&s;timation of
our&s;elves and others, to hold the lowe&s;t
place; as in the acqui&s;ition of them we
can claim no merit, but mu&s;t a&s;cribe them
entirely to the gift of nature. Yet envy
has often &s;howed it&s;elf here in full malig|nity;
though a &s;mall mea&s;ure of reflection
might have di&s;covered, that there was little
or no ground for this pa&s;&s;ion to ari&s;e. It
would have proved a ble&s;&s;ing to multi|tudes,
to have wanted tho&s;e advantages for
which they are envied. How frequently,
for in&s;tance, has Beauty betrayed the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors
of it into many a &s;nare, and brought
upon them many a di&s;a&s;ter? Beheld with
&s;piteful eyes by tho&s;e who are their rivals,
they, in the mean time, glow with no le&s;s
envy again&s;t others by whom they are &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed;
while, in the mid&s;t of their com|petitions,
jealou&s;ies, and concealed enmi|ties,
the fading flower is ea&s;ily bla&s;ted;
&s;hortlived at the be&s;t; and trifling, at any
<PB N="159" REF="168">
rate, in compari&s;on with the higher, and
more la&s;ting beauties of the mind.</P>
<P>But of all the grounds of envy among
men, &s;uperiority in rank and fortune is
the mo&s;t general. Hence, the malignity
which the poor commonly bear to the
rich, as ingro&s;&s;ing to them&s;elves all the
comforts of life. Hence, the evil eye with
which per&s;ons of inferior &s;tation &s;crutini&s;e
tho&s;e who are above them in rank; and if
they approach to that rank, their envy is ge|nerally
&s;tronge&s;t again&s;t &s;uch as are ju&s;t one
&s;tep higher than them&s;elves.&mdash;Alas! my
friends, all this envious di&s;quietude, which
agitates the world, ari&s;es from a deceitful
figure which impo&s;es on the public view.
Fal&s;e colours are hung out: the real &s;tate
of men is not, what it &s;eems to be. The
order of &s;ociety requires a di&s;tinction of
ranks to take place; but in point of hap|pine&s;s,
all men come much nearer to equa|lity
than is commonly imagined; and the
circum&s;tances, which form any material
difference of happine&s;s among them, are not
of that nature which renders them grounds
<PB N="160" REF="169">
of envy. The poor man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not, it
is true, &s;ome of the conveniences and
plea&s;ures of the rich; but, in return, he
is free of many embarra&s;&s;ments to which
they are &s;ubject. By the &s;implicity and
uniformity of his life, he is delivered from
that variety of cares, which perplex tho&s;e
who have great affairs to manage, intricate
plans to pur&s;ue, many enemies, perhaps, to
encounter in the pur&s;uit. In the tranquil|lity
of his &s;mall habitation, and private
family, he enjoys a peace which is often
unknown at courts. The gratifications of
nature, which are always the mo&s;t &s;atis|factory,
are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by him to their full
extent; and if he be a &s;tranger to the re|fined
plea&s;ures of the wealthy, he is un|acquainted
al&s;o with the de&s;ire of them,
and by con&s;equence, feels no want. His
plain meal &s;atisfies his appetite, with a re|li&s;h,
probably, higher than that of the rich
man, who &s;its down to his luxurious ban|quet.
His &s;leep is more &s;ound; his health
more firm; he knows not what &s;pleen,
languor, or li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s are. His accu&s;tom|ed
<PB N="161" REF="170">
employments or labours are not more
oppre&s;&s;ive to him, than the labour of at|tendance
on courts and the great, the la|bours
of dre&s;s, the fatigue of amu&s;ements,
the very weight of idlene&s;s, frequently are
to the rich. In the mean time, all the
beauty of the face of nature, all the enjoy|ments
of dome&s;tic &s;ociety, all the gaiety
and chearfulne&s;s of an ea&s;y mind, are as
open to him as to tho&s;e of the highe&s;t
rank. The &s;plendour of retinue, the &s;ound
of titles, the appearances of high re&s;pect,
are indeed &s;oothing, for a &s;hort time, to
the great. But become familiar, they are
&s;oon forgotten. Cu&s;tom effaces their im|pre&s;&s;ion.
They &s;ink into the rank of tho&s;e
ordinary things, which daily recur, without
rai&s;ing any &s;en&s;ation of joy.&mdash;Cea&s;e, there|fore,
from looking up with di&s;content and
envy to tho&s;e whom birth or fortune have
placed above you. Adju&s;t the balance of
happine&s;s fairly. When you think of the
enjoyments you want, think al&s;o of the
troubles from which you are free. Allow
their ju&s;t value to the comforts you po&s;|&s;e&s;s;
<PB N="162" REF="171">
and you will find rea&s;on to re&s;t &s;a|tisfied,
with a very moderate, though not
an opulent and &s;plendid, condition of for|tune.
Often, did you know the whole,
you would be inclined to pity the &s;tate of
tho&s;e whom you now envy.</P>
<P>III. SUPERIOR &s;ucce&s;s in the cour&s;e of
worldly pur&s;uits, is a frequent ground of
envy. Among all ranks of men, compe|titions
ari&s;e. Wherever any favourite ob|ject
is pur&s;ued in common, jealou&s;ies &s;el|dom
fail to take place among tho&s;e who
are equally de&s;irous of attaining it; as in
that ancient in&s;tance of envy recorded of
Jo&s;eph's brethren, who <HI>hated their brother,
becau&s;e their father loved him more than all
the re&s;t</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxvii. 4.</NOTE>. &startq;I could ea&s;ily bear,&endq; &s;ays one,
&startq;that &s;ome others &s;hould be more repu|table
or famous, &s;hould be richer or
greater, than I. It is but ju&s;t, that this
man &s;hould enjoy the di&s;tinction to
which his &s;plendid abilities have rai&s;ed
<PB N="163" REF="172">
him. It is natural for that man, to
command the re&s;pect to which he is in|titled
by his birth or his rank. But
when I, and another, have &s;tarted in the
race of life, upon equal terms, and in
the &s;ame rank; that he, without any
preten&s;ion to uncommon merit, &s;hould
have &s;uddenly &s;o far out&s;tripped me;
&s;hould have ingro&s;&s;ed all that public fa|vour
to which I am no le&s;s intitled than
he; this is, what I cannot bear; my
blood boils, my &s;pirit &s;wells with indig|nation,
at this unde&s;erved treatment I
have &s;uffered from the world.&endq; Com|plaints
of this nature are often made, by
them who &s;eek to ju&s;tify the envy which
they bear to their more pro&s;perous neigh|bours.
But if &s;uch per&s;ons wi&s;h not to be
thought unju&s;t, let me de&s;ire them to in|quire,
whether they have been altogether
fair in the compari&s;on they have made of
their own merit with that of their rivals;
and whether they have not them&s;elves to
blame, more than the world, for being left
behind in the career of fortune. The world
<PB N="164" REF="173">
is not always blind or unju&s;t, in conferring
its favours. In&s;tances indeed, &s;ometimes,
occur, of de&s;erving per&s;ons prevented, by a
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of cro&s;s incidents, from ri&s;ing
into public acceptance. But, in the ordi|nary
cour&s;e of things, merit, &s;ooner or later,
receives a reward; while the greater part
of men's misfortunes and di&s;appointments
can, generally, be traced to &s;ome mi&s;conduct
of their own. <HI>Wi&s;dom bringeth to honour:
The hand of the diligent maketh rich;</HI> and, it
has been &s;aid, not altogether without rea|&s;on,
that, of his own fortune in life, every
man is the chief artificer. If Jo&s;eph was
preferred by the father to all his brethren,
his &s;ub&s;equent conduct &s;howed how well
he merited the preference.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing, however, the world to have
been unju&s;t, in an uncommon degree, with
regard to you, this will not vindicate ma|lignity
and envy towards a more pro&s;|perous
competitor. You may accu&s;e the
world; but what rea&s;on have you to bear
ill-will to him, who has only improved the
favour which the world &s;howed him? If,
<PB N="165" REF="174">
by means that are unfair, he has ri&s;en;
and, to advance him&s;elf, has acted inju|riou&s;ly
by you, re&s;entment is ju&s;tifiable;
but if you cannot accu&s;e him of any &s;uch
improper conduct, his &s;ucce&s;s alone gives
no &s;anction to your envy. You, perhaps,
preferred the enjoyment of your ea&s;e, to the
&s;tir of a bu&s;y, or to the cares of a thought|ful
life. Retired from the world, and fol|lowing
your favourite inclinations, you were
not always attentive to &s;eize the opportu|nities
which offered, for doing ju&s;tice to
your character, and improving your &s;itua|tion.
Ought you then to complain, if the
more active and laborious have acquired
what you were negligent to gain? Con&s;i|der,
that if you have obtained le&s;s prefer|ment,
you have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more indulgence
and ea&s;e. Con&s;ider, moreover, that the ri|val
to whom you look up with repining
eyes, though more fortunate in the world,
may perhaps, on the whole, not be more
happy than you. He has all the vici&s;&s;i|tudes
of the world before him. He may
have much to encounter, much to &s;uffer,
<PB N="166" REF="175">
from which you are protected by the great|er
ob&s;curity of your &s;tation. Every &s;itua|tion
in life, has both a bright and a dark
&s;ide. Let not your attention dwell only
on what is bright on the &s;ide of tho&s;e you
envy, and dark on your own. But bring|ing
into view both &s;ides of your re&s;pective
conditions, e&s;timate fairly the &s;um of fe|licity.</P>
<P>THUS I have &s;ugge&s;ted &s;everal con&s;ider|ations,
for evincing the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of
that di&s;quietude which envy rai&s;es in our
brea&s;ts; con&s;iderations, which tend at lea&s;t
to mitigate and allay the workings of this
malignant pa&s;&s;ion, and which, in a &s;ober
mind, ought totally to extingui&s;h it. The
&s;cope of the whole has been, to promote,
in every one, contentment with his own
&s;tate. Many arguments of a different na|ture
may be employed again&s;t envy; &s;ome
taken from its &s;inful and criminal nature;
&s;ome, from the mi&s;chiefs to which it gives
ri&s;e in the world; others, from the mi&s;ery
which it produces to him who nouri&s;hes
<PB N="167" REF="176">
this viper in his bo&s;om. But, undoubted|ly,
the mo&s;t efficacious arguments, are &s;uch
as &s;how, that the circum&s;tances of others,
compared with our own, afford no ground
for envy. The mi&s;taken ideas which are
entertained, of the high importance of cer|tain
worldly advantages and di&s;tinctions,
form the principal cau&s;e of our repining
at our own lot, and envying that of others.
To things light in them&s;elves, our imagi|nation
has added undue weight. Did we
allow reflection and wi&s;dom to correct the
prejudices which we have imbibed, and to
di&s;per&s;e tho&s;e phantoms of our own creating,
the gloom which overca&s;ts us would gra|dually
vani&s;h. Together with returning
contentment, the &s;ky would clear up, and
every object brighten around us. It is in
the &s;ullen and dark &s;hade of di&s;content,
that noxious pa&s;&s;ions, like venomous ani|mals,
breed, and prey upon the heart.</P>
<P>ENVY is a pa&s;&s;ion of &s;o odious a nature,
that not only it is concealed as much as
po&s;&s;ible from the world, but every man is
<PB N="168" REF="177">
glad to di&s;&s;emble the appearances of it to
his own heart. Hence, it is apt to grow
upon him unperceived. Let him who is
de&s;irous to keep his heart cha&s;te and pure
from its influence, examine him&s;elf &s;trictly
on tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions which he bears to|wards
his pro&s;perous neighbours. Does he
ever view, with &s;ecret unea&s;ine&s;s, the merit
of others ri&s;ing into notice and di&s;tinction?
Does he hear their prai&s;es with unwilling
ear? Does he feel an inclination to depre|ciate,
what he dares not openly blame?
When obliged to commend, does his cold
and aukward approbation, in&s;inuate his be|lief
of &s;ome unkown defects in the ap|plauded
character? From &s;uch &s;yptoms
as the&s;e, he may infer that the di&s;ea&s;e of
envy is forming; that the poi&s;on is be|ginning
to &s;pread its infection over his
heart.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;es that nouri&s;h envy are prin|cipally
two; and which, very frequent|ly,
operate in conjunction; the&s;e are, pride
and indolence. The connection of pride
<PB N="169" REF="178">
with envy, is obvious and direct. The high
value which the proud &s;et on their own
merit, the unrea&s;onable claims which they
form on the world, and the inju&s;tice which
they &s;uppo&s;e to be done to them by any prefe|rence
given to others, are perpetual &s;ources,
$$r&s;t of di&s;content, and next of envy. When
indolence is joined to pride, the di&s;ea&s;e of
the mind becomes more inveterate and in|curable.
Pride leads men to claim more
than they de&s;erve. Indolence prevents them
from obtaining what they might ju&s;tly
claim. Di&s;appointments follow; and &s;pleen,
malignity, and envy, rage within them.
The proud and indolent, are always envi|ous.
Wrapt up in their own importance,
they &s;it &s;till, and repine, becau&s;e others are
more pro&s;perous than they; while, with
all their high opinion of them&s;elves, they
have done nothing either to de&s;erve, or to
acquire, pro&s;perity. As, therefore, we va|lue
our virtue, or our peace, let us guard
again&s;t the&s;e two evil di&s;po&s;itions of mind.
Let us be mode&s;t in our own e&s;teem, and,
by diligence and indu&s;try, &s;tudy to acquire
<PB N="170" REF="179">
the e&s;teem of others. So &s;hall we &s;hut up
the avenues that lead to many a bad pa&s;|&s;ion;
and &s;hall learn, <HI>in what&s;oever &s;tate we
are, therewith to be content.</HI></P>
<P>FINALLY, in order to &s;ubdue envy, let
us bring often into view tho&s;e religion$
con&s;iderations which regard us particularly
as Chri&s;tians. Let us remember how un|worthy
we all are in the &s;ight of God; and
how much the ble&s;&s;ings which each of us
enjoy, are beyond what we de&s;erve. Let us
nouri&s;h reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to that
Divine government, which has appointed
to every one &s;uch a condition in the world
as is fitte&s;t for him to po&s;&s;e&s;s. Let us re|collect
how oppo&s;ite the Chri&s;tian &s;pirit is
to envy; and what &s;acred obligations it
lays upon us, to walk in love and charity
towards one another. Indeed, when we
reflect on the many mi&s;eries which abound
in human life; on the &s;canty proportion of
happine&s;s which any man is here allowed
to enjoy; on the &s;mall difference which the
diver&s;ity of fortune makes on that &s;canty
<PB N="171" REF="180">
proportion; it is &s;urpri&s;ing, that envy &s;hould
ever have been a prevalent pa&s;&s;ion among
men, much more that it &s;hould have pre|vailed
among Chri&s;tians. Where &s;o much
is &s;uffered in common, little room is left
for envy. There is more occa&s;ion for pity
and &s;ympathy, and inclination to a&s;&s;i&s;t each
other. To our own good endeavours for
rectifying our di&s;po&s;itions, let us not forget
to add &s;erious prayers to the Author of our
being, that he who made the heart of man,
and knows all its infirmities, would tho|roughly
purify our hearts from a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o
ba&s;e, and &s;o criminal, as envy. <HI>Create in me,
O God, a clean heart; and renew a right &s;pi|rit
within me. Search me, and know my
heart. Try me, and know my thoughts. See
if there be any wicked way in me, and lead
me in the way everla&s;ting</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. li. 10.; cxxxix. 23. 24.</NOTE>.</P>

indolence are incon&s;i&s;tent with his hope of
heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="182">
But it has been &s;ometimes &s;uppo&s;ed, that
indu&s;try, as far as it is matter of duty, re|gards
our &s;piritual concerns and employ|ments
only; and that one might be very
bu&s;y as a Chri&s;tian, who was very idle as a
man. Hence, among &s;ome denominations of
Chri&s;tians, an opinion has prevailed, that the
perfection of religion was to be found in
tho&s;e mona&s;tic retreats, where every active
function of civil life was totally excluded,
and the whole time of men filled up with
exerci&s;es of devotion. They who hold &s;uch
opinions proceed on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that
religion has little or no concern with the
ordinary affairs of the world; that its du|ties
&s;tand apart by them&s;elves; and mingle
not in the intercour&s;e which men have with
one another. The perfect Chri&s;tian was
imagined to live a &s;ort of angelic life, &s;e|que&s;tered
from the bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ures
of this contemptible &s;tate. The go&s;pel, on
the contrary, repre&s;ents the religion of
Chri&s;t as intended for the benefit of human
&s;ociety. It a&s;&s;umes men as engaged in the
bu&s;ine&s;s of active life; and directs its ex|hortations,
<PB N="174" REF="183">
accordingly, to all ranks and
&s;tations; to the magi&s;trate and the &s;ubject,
to the ma&s;ter and the &s;ervant, to the rich
and the poor, to them that buy and them
that &s;ell, them <HI>that u&s;e</HI> and them <HI>that abu&s;e</HI>
the world. Some duties, indeed, require
privacy and retreat. But the mo&s;t import|ant
mu&s;t be performed in the mid&s;t of the
world, where we are commanded to <HI>&s;hine
as lights,</HI> and <HI>by our good works to glorify
our Father which is in heaven.</HI> This world,
as the context repre&s;ents it, is God's vine|yard,
where each of us has a ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned
him to perform. In every &s;tation, and at
every period of life, labour is required. At
the third, the &s;ixth, or the eleventh hour,
we are commanded to work, if we would
not incur, from the great Lord of the vine|yard,
this reproof, <HI>Why &s;tand ye here all the
day idle?</HI>&mdash;We may, I confe&s;s, be bu&s;y
about many things, and yet be found ne|gligent
of the <HI>One thing needful.</HI> We may
be very active, and, withal, very ill employ|ed.
But though a per&s;on may be indu|&s;trious
without being religious, I mu&s;t at
<PB N="175" REF="184">
the &s;ame time admoni&s;h you, that no man
can be idle without being &s;inful. This I
&s;hall endeavour to &s;how in the &s;equel of the
di&s;cour&s;e; wherein I purpo&s;e to reprove a
vice which is too common among all ranks
of men. Superiors admoni&s;h their infe|riors,
and parents tell their children, that
idlene&s;s is the mother of every &s;in; while,
in their own practice, they often &s;et the
example of what they reprobate &s;everely in
others. I &s;hall &s;tudy to &s;how, that the idle
man is, in every view, both fooli&s;h, and
criminal; that he neither lives to God;
nor lives to the world; nor lives to him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>I. HE lives not to God. The great and
wi&s;e Creator certainly does nothing in vain.
A &s;mall mea&s;ure of reflection might con|vince
every one, that for &s;ome u&s;eful pur|po&s;e
he was &s;ent into the world. The na|ture
of man bears no mark of in&s;ignifican|cy,
or neglect. He is placed at the head
of all things here below. He is furni&s;hed
with a great preparation of faculties and

powers. He is enlightened by rea&s;on with
many important di&s;coveries; even taught
by revelation to con&s;ider him&s;elf as ran&s;o|med,
by the death of Chri&s;t, from mi&s;ery;
and intended to ri&s;e, by gradual advances,
to a &s;till higher rank in the univer&s;e of
God. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, thus di&s;tin|gui&s;hed,
thus favoured and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his
Creator, can he hope to be forgiven, if he
aim at no improvement, if he pur&s;ue no
u&s;eful de&s;ign, live for no other purpo&s;e but
to indulge in &s;loth, to con&s;ume the fruits
of the earth, and to &s;pend his days in a
dream of vanity? Exi&s;tence is a &s;acred
tru&s;t; and he who thus mi&s;employs, and
&s;quanders it away, is treacherous to its Au|thor.
&mdash;Look around you, and you will
behold the whole univer&s;e full of active
powers. Action is, to &s;peak &s;o, the genius
of nature. By motion and exertion, the &s;y|&s;tem
of being is pre&s;erved in vigour. By
its different parts always acting in &s;ubordi|nation
one to another, the perfection of the
whole is carried on. The heavenly bodies
perpetually revolve. Day and night ince&s;|&s;antly
<PB N="177" REF="190">
repeat their appointed cour&s;e. Con|tinual
operations are going on in the earth,
and in the waters. Nothing &s;tands &s;till.
All is alive, and &s;tirring, throughout the
univer&s;e.&mdash;In the mid&s;t of this animated
and bu&s;y &s;cene, is man alone to remain
idle in his place? Belongs it to him, to be
the &s;ole inactive and &s;lothful being in the
creation, when he has &s;o much allotted
him to do; when in &s;o many various ways
he might improve his own nature; might
advance the glory of the God who made
him; and contribute his part to the gene|ral
good?</P>
<P>Hardly is there any feeling of the hu|man
heart more natural, or more univer|&s;al,
than that of our being accountable to
God. It is, what the mo&s;t profligate can
never totally era&s;e. Almo&s;t all nations have
agreed in the belief, that there is to come
&s;ome period, when the Almighty will act
as the judge of his creatures. Pre&s;enti|ments
of this, work in every brea&s;t. Con|&s;cience
has already erected a tribunal, on
which it anticipates the &s;entence which at
<PB N="178" REF="191">
that period &s;hall be pa&s;&s;ed. Before this tri|bunal
let us &s;ometimes place our&s;elves in
&s;erious thought, and con&s;ider what account
we are prepared to give of our conduct to
Him who made us. &startq;I placed you,&endq; the
great Judge may then be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ay,
&startq;in a &s;tation where you had many occa|&s;ions
action, and many opportunities
of improvement. You were taught, and
you knew, your duty. Throughout a
cour&s;e of years I continued your life. I
&s;urrounded you with friends, to whom
you might be u&s;eful. I gave you health,
ea&s;e, lei&s;ure, and various advantages of
&s;ituation.&mdash;Where are the fruits of
tho&s;e talents which you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed? What
good have you done with them to your|&s;elves?
what good, to others? How
have you filled up your place, or an&s;wer|ed
your de&s;tination, in the world? Pro|duce
&s;ome evidence, of your not having
exi&s;ted altogether ill vain?&endq;&mdash;Let &s;uch
as are now mere blanks in the world, and
a burden to the earth, think what an&s;wer
they will give to tho&s;e awful que&s;tions.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="192">
II. THE idle live not to the world, and
their fellow-creatures around them, any
more than they do to God. Had any man
a title to &s;tand alone, and to be independ|ent
of his fellows, he might then con&s;ider
him&s;elf as at liberty to indulge in &s;olitary
ea&s;e and &s;loth, without being re&s;pon&s;ible
to others for the manner in which he
cho&s;e to live. But, on the face of the
earth, there is no &s;uch per&s;on, from the
King on his throne, to the beggar in his
cottage. We are all connected with one
another, by various relations; which create
at chain of mutual dependence, reaching
from the highe&s;t, to the lowe&s;t &s;tation in
&s;ociety. The order and happine&s;s of the
world cannot be maintained, without a per|petual
circulation of active duties and of|fices,
which all are called upon to perform
in their turn. Superiors are no more inde|pendent
of their inferiors, than the&s;e infe|riors
are of them. Each have demands
and claims upon the other; and he, who
in any &s;ituation of life, refu&s;es to act his
part, and to contribute his &s;hare to the ge|neral
<PB N="180" REF="193">
&s;tock of felicity, de&s;erves to be pro|&s;cribed
from &s;ociety, as an unworthy mem|ber.
<HI>If any man will not work,</HI> &s;ays the A|po&s;tle
Paul, <HI>neither &s;hould he eat</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">2 The&s;&s;. iii. 10.</NOTE>. If he
will do nothing to advance the purpo&s;es of
&s;ociety, he has no title to enjoy the advan|tages
of it.</P>
<P>It is &s;ometimes &s;uppo&s;ed, that indu&s;try
and diligence are duties required of the
poor alone, and that riches confer the pri|vilege
of being idle. This is &s;o far from
being ju&s;tified by rea&s;on, how often &s;oever
it may obtain in fact, that the higher one
is rai&s;ed in the world, his obligation to be
u&s;eful is proportionably increa&s;ed. The
claims upon him, from various quarters,
multiply. The &s;phere of his active duties
widens on every hand. Even &s;uppo&s;ing
him exempted from exerting him&s;elf in be|half
of his inferiors, &s;uppo&s;ing the relation
between &s;uperiors and inferiors aboli&s;hed,
the relation among equals mu&s;t &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t.
If there be no man, however high in rank,
who &s;tands not frequently in need of the
<PB N="181" REF="194">
good offices of his friends, does he think
that he owes nothing to them in return?
Can he fold his arms in &s;elfi&s;h indolence,
and expect to be &s;erved by others, if he
will not exert him&s;elf, in doing &s;ervice to
any?&mdash;Were there no other call to indu|&s;try,
but the relation in which every one
&s;tands to his own family, the remembrance
of this alone, &s;hould make the man of idle|ne&s;s
blu&s;h. Pretends he to love tho&s;e with
whom he is connected by the deare&s;t ties,
and yet will he not be&s;tir him&s;elf for their
guidance, their &s;upport, or their advance|ment
in the world? How immoral, and
cruel, is the part he acts, who &s;lumbers in
&s;en&s;ual ea&s;e, while the wants and demands
of a helple&s;s family cry aloud, but cry in
vain, for his vigorous exertions? Is this a
hu&s;band, is this a father, that de&s;erves to
be honoured with tho&s;e &s;acred names?
How many voices will be lifted up again&s;t
him, at the la&s;t day? Let &s;uch per&s;ons re|member
the awful words of &s;cripture, and
tremble. It is written in the Fir&s;t Epi&s;tle
to Timothy, the fifth chapter, and eighth
<PB N="182" REF="195">
ver&s;e, <HI>If any provide not for his own, and
&s;pecially for tho&s;e of his own hou&s;e, he hath
denied the faith, and is wor&s;e than an infi|del.</HI></P>
<P>III. THE idle man lives not to him&s;elf,
with any more advantage than he lives to
the world. It is indeed on a &s;uppo&s;ition
entirely oppo&s;ite, that per&s;ons of this cha|racter
proceed. They imagine that, how
deficient &s;oever they may be in point of
duty, they at lea&s;t con&s;ult their own &s;ati&s;|faction.
They leave to others the drudge|ry
of life; and betake them&s;elves, as they
think, to the quarter of enjoyment and
ea&s;e. Now, in contradiction to this, I a&s;|&s;ert,
and hope to prove, that the idle man,
fir&s;t, &s;huts the door again&s;t all improve|ment;
next, that he opens it wide to every
de&s;tructive folly; and, la&s;tly, that he ex|cludes
him&s;elf from the true enjoyment of
plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>FIRST, He &s;huts the door again&s;t im|provement
of every kind, whether of mind,
<PB N="183" REF="196">
body, or fortune. The law of our nature,
the condition under which we were placed
from our birth, is, that nothing good or
great is to be acquired, without toil and in|du&s;try.
A price is appointed by Provi|dence
to be paid for every thing; and the
price of improvement, is labour. Indu|&s;try
may, indeed, be &s;ometimes di&s;appointed.
<HI>The race</HI> may not be always <HI>to the &s;wift,</HI>
nor <HI>the battle to the &s;trong.</HI> But, at the
&s;ame time, it is certain that, in the ordi|nary
cour&s;e of things, without &s;trength,
the battle cannot be gained; without &s;wift|ne&s;s,
the race cannot be run with &s;ucce&s;s.
<HI>In all labour,</HI> &s;ays the wi&s;e man, <HI>there is
profit; but the &s;oul of the &s;luggard de&s;ireth,
and hath nothing</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv. 23.; xiii. 4.</NOTE>. If we con&s;ult either
the improvement of the mind, or the health
of the body, it is well known that exerci&s;e
is the great in&s;trument of promoting both.
Sloth enfeebles equally the bodily, and the
mental powers. As in the animal &s;y&s;tem
it engenders di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o on the faculties of
<PB N="184" REF="197">
the &s;oul it brings a fatal ru&s;t, which cor|rodes
and wa&s;tes them; which, in a &s;hort
time, reduces the brighte&s;t genius to the
&s;ame level with the meane&s;t under&s;tanding.
The great differences which take place a|mong
men, are not owing to a di&s;tinction
that nature has made in their original
powers, &s;o much as to the &s;uperior dili|gence
with which &s;ome have improved
the&s;e powers beyond others. To no pur|po&s;e
do we po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;eeds of many great
abilities, if they are &s;uffered to lie dormant
within us. It is not the latent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
but the active exertion of them, which
gives them merit. Thou&s;ands whom in|dolence
has &s;unk into contemptible ob&s;cu|rity,
might have come forward to the high|e&s;t
di&s;tinction, if idlene&s;s had not fru&s;tra|ted
the effect of all their powers.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of going on to improvement, all
things go to decline, with the idle man.
His character falls into contempt. His for|tune
is con&s;umed. Di&s;order, confu&s;ion,
and embarra&s;&s;ment, mark his whole &s;itua|tion.
Ob&s;erve in what lively colours the
<PB N="185" REF="198">
&s;tate of his affairs is de&s;cribed by Solomon.
<HI>I went by the field of the &s;lothful, and by the
vineyard of the man void of under&s;tanding.
And lo! it was all grown over with thorns;
and nettles had covered the face thereof; and
the &s;tone wall thereof was broken down.
Then I &s;aw and con&s;idered it well. I looked
upon it, and received in&s;truction</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiv. 30. 31. 32.</NOTE>. In the
mid&s;t, too, of tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es which idle|ne&s;s
brings on its votaries, they mu&s;t &s;ub|mit
to innumerable mortifications, which
never fail to attend their &s;hameful conduct.
They mu&s;t reckon, on &s;eeing them&s;elves
contemned by the virtuous and wi&s;e, and
&s;lighted by the thriving part of mankind.
They mu&s;t expect to be left behind by eve|ry
competitor for rank or fortune. They
will be obliged to humble them&s;elves be|fore
per&s;ons, now far their &s;uperiors in the
world, whom, once, they would have di&s;|dained
to acknowledge as their equals.&mdash;
Is it in this manner, that a man lives to
him&s;elf? Are the&s;e the advantages, which
<PB N="186" REF="199">
were expected to be found in the lap of ea&s;e?
The down may at fir&s;t have appear|ed
&s;oft: But it will &s;oon be found to cover
thorns innumerable. <HI>How long wilt thou
&s;leep, O &s;luggard? When wilt thou ari&s;e out
of thy &s;leep? Yet a little &s;leep; yet a little
&s;lumber, a little folding of the bands to &s;leep.
So &s;hall thy poverty come as one that travel|leth;
and thy want as an armed man</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiv. 33. 34.</NOTE>.&mdash;
But this is only a &s;mall part of the evils
which per&s;ons of this de&s;cription bring on
them&s;elves: For,</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, while in this man|ner
they &s;hut the door again&s;t every im|provement,
they open it wide to the mo&s;t
de&s;tructive vices and follies. The hu|man
mind cannot remain always unem|ployed.
Its pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t have &s;ome exer|ci&s;e.
If we &s;upply them not with proper
employment, they are &s;ure to run loo&s;e
into riot and di&s;order. While we are un|occupied
by what is good, evil is continu|ally
<PB N="187" REF="200">
at hand; and hence it is &s;aid in Scrip|ture,
that as &s;oon as Satan <HI>found the hou&s;e
empty,</HI> he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and filled it <HI>with evil &s;pirits</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Matth. xii. 44.</NOTE>. Every man who recollects
his conduct, may be &s;atisfied, that his
hours of idlene&s;s have always proved the
hours mo&s;t dangerous to virtue. It was
then, that criminal de&s;ires aro&s;e; guilty
pur&s;uits were &s;ugge&s;ted; and de&s;igns were
formed, which, in their i&s;&s;ue, have di&s;|quieted
and embittered his whole life. If
&s;ea&s;ons of idlene&s;s be dangerous, what mu&s;t
a continued habit of it prove? Habitual
indolence, by a &s;ilent and &s;ecret progre&s;s,
undermines every virtue in the &s;oul. More
violent pa&s;&s;ions run their cour&s;e, and ter|minate.
They are like rapid torrents, which
foam, and &s;well, and bear down every
thing before them. But after having over|flowed
their banks, their impetuo&s;ity &s;ub|&s;ides.
They return, by degrees, into their
natural channel; and the damage which
they have done, can be repaired. Sloth is
<PB N="188" REF="201">
like the &s;lowly-flowing, putrid &s;tream, which &s;tagnates in the mar&s;h, breeds veno|mous
animals, and poi&s;onous plants; and
infects with pe&s;tilential vapours the whole
country round it. Having once tainted
the &s;oul, it leaves no part of it &s;ound; and,
at the &s;ame time, gives not tho&s;e alarms
to con&s;cience, which the eruptions of bold|er
and fiercer emotions often occa&s;ion. The
di&s;ea&s;e which it brings on, is creeping and
in&s;idious; and is, on that account, more
certainly mortal.</P>
<P>One con&s;tant effect of idlene&s;s, is to nou|ri&s;h
the pa&s;&s;ions, and, of cour&s;e, to height|en
our demands for gratification; while it
unhappily withdraws from us the proper
means of gratifying the&s;e demands. If the
de&s;ires of the indu&s;trious man be &s;et upon
opulence or rank, upon the conveniencies,
or the &s;plendour of life, he can accompli&s;h
his de&s;ires, by methods which are fair and
allowable. The idle man has the &s;ame de|&s;ires
with the indu&s;trious, but not the &s;ame
re&s;ources for compa&s;&s;ing his ends by ho|nourable
means. He mu&s;t therefore turn
<PB N="189" REF="202">
him&s;elf to &s;eek by fraud, or by violence,
what he cannot &s;ubmit to acquire by in|du&s;try.
Hence, the origin of tho&s;e multi|plied
crimes to which idlene&s;s is daily gi|ving
birth in the world; and which con|tribute
&s;o much to violate the order, and
to di&s;turb the peace, of &s;ociety.&mdash;In gene|ral,
the children of idlene&s;s may be rank|ed
under two denominations or cla&s;&s;es of
men; both of whom may, too ju&s;tly, be
termed, The children of the devil. Either,
incapable of any effort, they are &s;uch as &s;ink
into ab&s;olute meanne&s;s of character, and
contentedly wallow with the drunkard and
debauchee, among the herd of the &s;en&s;ual;
until poverty overtake them, or di&s;ea&s;e cut
them off; Or, they are &s;uch as, retaining
&s;ome remains of vigour, are impelled, by
their pa&s;&s;ions, to venture on a de&s;perate at|tempt
for retrieving their ruined fortunes.
In this ca&s;e, they employ the art of the
fraudulent game&s;ter to en&s;nare the un|wary.
They i&s;&s;ue forth with the high|wayman
to plunder on the road; or with
the thief and the robber, they infe&s;t the
<PB N="190" REF="203">
city by night. From this cla&s;s, our pri|&s;ons
are peopled; and by them the &s;caffold
is furni&s;hed with tho&s;e melancholy admo|nitions,
which are &s;o often delivered from it
to the crowd. Such are frequently the tra|gical,
but well known, con&s;equences of the
vice again&s;t which I now warn you.</P>
<P>IN the third, and la&s;t place, how dangerous
&s;oever idlene&s;s may be to virtue,
are there not pleasures, it may be &s;aid
which attend it? Is there not ground to
plead, that it brings a relea&s;e from the op|pre&s;&s;ive
cares of the world; and &s;ooths the
mind with a gentle &s;atisfaction, which is
not to be found amid&s;t the toils of a bu&s;y
and active life?&mdash;This is an advantage
which, lea&s;t of all others, we admit it to
po&s;&s;e&s;s. In behalf of ince&s;&s;ant labour, no
man contends. Occa&s;ional relea&s;e from toil,
and indulgence of ea&s;e, is what nature de|mands,
and virtue allows. But what we
a&s;&s;ert is, that nothing is &s;o great an enemy
to the lively and &s;pirited enjoyment of life,
as a relaxed and indolent habit of mind.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="204">
He who knows not what it is to labour,
knows not what it is to enjoy. The feli|city
of human life, depends on the regular
profecution of &s;ome laudable purpo&s;e or
object, which keeps awake and enlivens all
our powers. Our happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in the
pur&s;uit, much more than in the attainment,
of any temporal good. Re&s;t is agreeable;
but it is only from preceding labours, that
re&s;t acquires its true reli&s;h. When the
mind is &s;uffered to remain in continued
inaction, all its powers decay. It &s;oon lan|gui&s;hes
and &s;ickens; and the plea&s;ures
which it propo&s;ed to obtain from re&s;t, end
in tediou&s;ne&s;s and in&s;ipidity. To this, let
that mi&s;erable &s;et of men bear witne&s;s,
who, after &s;pending great part of their life
in active indu&s;try, have retired to what
they fancied was to be a plea&s;ing enjoy|ment
of them&s;elves, in wealthy inacti|vity;
and profound repo&s;e. Where they
expected to find an ely&s;ium, they have
found nothing but a dreary and com|fortle&s;s
wa&s;te. Their days have dragged
on, in uniform languor; with the melan|choly
<PB N="192" REF="205">
remembrance often returning, of the
chearful hours they pa&s;&s;ed, when they were
engaged in the hone&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s, and labours
of the world.</P>
<P>We appeal to every one who has the lea&s;t
knowledge or ob&s;ervation of life, whether
the bu&s;y, or the idle, have the mo&s;t agree|able
enjoyment of them&s;elves? Compare
them in their families. Compare them
in the &s;ocieties with which they mingle;
and remark, which of them di&s;cover mo&s;t
chearfulne&s;s and gaiety; which po&s;&s;e&s;s the
mo&s;t regular flow of &s;pirits; who&s;e temper
is mo&s;t equal; who&s;e good humour, mo&s;t
unclouded. While the active and diligent
both enliven, and enjoy, &s;ociety, the idle
are not only a burden to them&s;elves, but a
burden to tho&s;e with whom they are con|nected;
a nui&s;ance to all whom they op|pre&s;s
with their company. On whom does
time hang &s;o heavy, as on the &s;lothful and
lazy? To whom are the hours &s;o linger|ing?
Who are &s;o often devoured with
&s;pleen, and obliged to fly to every expedi|ent
which can help them to get rid of
<PB N="193" REF="206">
them&s;elves? In&s;tead of producing tran|quillity,
indolence produces a fretful re&s;t|le&s;&s;ne&s;s
of mind; gives ri&s;e to cravings
which are never &s;atisfied; nouri&s;hes a &s;ick|ly
effeminate delicacy, which &s;ours and cor|rupts
every plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>ENOUGH has now been &s;aid to convince
every thinking per&s;on, of the folly, the
guilt, and the mi&s;ery, of an idle &s;tate. Let
the&s;e admonitions &s;tir us up, to exert our|&s;elves
in our different occupations, with
that virtuous activity which becomes men
and Chri&s;tians. Let us ari&s;e from the bed
of &s;loth; di&s;tribute our time with attention
and care; and improve to advantage the
opportunities which Providence has be&s;tow|ed.
The material bu&s;ine&s;s in which our
&s;everal &s;tations engage us, may often prove
not &s;ufficient to occupy the whole of our
time and attention. In the life even of
bu&s;y men, there are frequent intervals of
lei&s;ure. Let them take care, that into
the&s;e, none of the vices of idlene&s;s creep.
Let &s;ome &s;econdary, &s;ome &s;ub&s;idiary em|ployment,
<PB N="194" REF="207">
of fair and laudable kind, be
always at hand to fill up tho&s;e vacant &s;paces
of life, which too many a&s;&s;ign, either to
corrupting amu&s;ements, or to mere ina|ction.
We ought never to forget, that en|tire
idlene&s;s always borders, either on mi|&s;ery,
or on guilt.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, let the cour&s;e of our
employments be ordered in &s;uch a manner,
that in carrying them on, we may be al&s;o
promoting our eternal intere&s;t. With the
bu&s;ine&s;s of the world, let us properly in|termix
the exerci&s;es of devotion. By reli|gious
duties, and virtuous actions, let us &s;tu|dy
to prepare our&s;elves for a better world.
In the mid&s;t of our labours for this life, it is
never to be forgotten, that we mu&s;t <HI>fir&s;t
&s;eek the kingdom of God, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI>
and <HI>give diligence to make our calling and
election &s;ure.</HI> Otherwi&s;e, how active &s;oever
we may &s;eem to be, our whole activity will
prove only a laborious idlene&s;s: We &s;hall

purpo&s;e, or to a purpo&s;e wor&s;e than none.
<PB N="195" REF="208">
Then only we fulfil the proper character of
Chri&s;tians, when we join that pious zeal
which becomes us as the &s;ervants of God,
with that indu&s;try which is required of
us, as good members of &s;ociety; when, ac|cording

the perfections of God, meeting him where|ever
we go, and called upon by a thou&s;and
objects, to confe&s;s his pre&s;ence, it is both the
misfortune and the crime of a great part
<PB N="197" REF="210">
of mankind, that they are &s;trangers to Him
in who&s;e world they dwell. Occupied with
nothing but their pur&s;uits of intere&s;t and
plea&s;ure, they pa&s;s through this world, as
though God were not there. The virtu|ous
and reflecting, are particularly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
from the giddy and di&s;&s;olute, by
that habitual &s;en&s;e of the divine pre&s;ence
which characteri&s;es the former. To them,
nothing appears void of God. They con|template
his perfections in the works of
nature; and they trace his Providence in
the incidents of life. When retired from
the world, he often employs their medita|tion.
When engaged in action, he always
influences their conduct. Wherever a pious
man is, or whatever he does, in the &s;tyle
of the text, he is <HI>continually with God.</HI></P>
<P>The happy effect of this &s;entiment on
the heart, is fully di&s;played in the context.
We &s;ee it allaying all the di&s;quiet which
the P&s;almi&s;t, in the preceding ver&s;es, de|&s;cribes
him&s;elf to have &s;uffered on account
of the pro&s;perity of the wicked. The fir&s;t
reflection which re&s;tored tranquillity to his
<PB N="198" REF="211">
mind, was the remembrance of the pre|&s;ence
of God. <HI>Neverthele&s;s, I am continu|ally
with thee; thou ha&s;t holden me by my
right hand.</HI> He became &s;en&s;ible, that what|ver
di&s;tre&s;&s;es the righteous might &s;uffer
for a time, they could not fail of being
compen&s;ated in the end, by that Almighty
Protector, who&s;e propitious pre&s;ence ever
continued to &s;urround them. Whereupon
follow tho&s;e memorable expre&s;&s;ions of his
tru&s;t and joy in God. <HI>Thou &s;halt guide me
with thy coun&s;el; and afterwards receive me
to glory. Whom have I in heaven but thee?
and there is none upon earth I de&s;ire be&s;ides
thee.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are principally two effects, which
the &s;en&s;e of the divine pre&s;ence is fitted to
produce upon men. One is, to re&s;train
them from vice; the other, to encourage
their virtue. Its operation, as a check up|on
the &s;inner, is obvious. The perpetual
pre&s;ence of &s;o powerful and venerable a
witne&s;s, is one of the mo&s;t awful con&s;idera|tions
which can be addre&s;&s;ed to the di&s;|&s;olute.
<PB N="199" REF="212">
It removes all the &s;ecurity which
&s;ecrecy can be &s;uppo&s;ed to give to crimes.
It aggravates the guilt of them, from be|ing
committed in face of the Almighty;
and has power to &s;trike terror into the
heart of the greate&s;t criminal, in the mid&s;t
of his mi&s;deeds. While this principle of
religion thus checks and terrifies the &s;in|ner,
it produces al&s;o another effect, that of
&s;trengthening and comforting the good
man, in the practice of his duty. It is the
influence of the divine pre&s;ence on good
men, which, in con&s;equence of the P&s;almi&s;t's
&s;entiment, I purpo&s;e to con&s;ider. To their
character, it belongs to <HI>be continually with
God.</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how the high
benefit and comfort which they derive
from &s;uch a habit of mind; and &s;hall, for
this end, fir&s;t con&s;ider their internal moral
&s;tate; and next, view them as they are af|fected
by &s;everal of the external accidents
and &s;ituations of life.</P>
<P>LET us begin with con&s;idering them in
their internal &s;tate. The belief of divine
<PB N="200" REF="213">
pre&s;ence acts upon them here, fir&s;t, as an
incitement to virtue. The pre&s;ence of one
whom we highly e&s;teem and revere, of a
&s;overeign, for in&s;tance, a father, or a friend,
who&s;e approbation we are &s;olicitous to gain,
is always found to exalt the powers of men,
to refine, and improve their behaviour.
Hence, it has been given as a rule by an|cient,
morali&s;ts, that, in order to excel in
virtue, we &s;hould propound to our&s;elves
&s;ome per&s;on of eminent and di&s;tingui&s;hed
worth; and &s;hould accu&s;tom our&s;elves to
act, as if he were &s;tanding by, and behold|ing
us. To the e&s;teem and approbation,
of their fellow creatures, none are in&s;en|&s;ible.
There are few who, in the con&s;pi|cuous
parts of their life, when they know
the eyes of the public to be fixed on them,
act not their part with propriety and de|corum.
But what is the ob&s;ervation of the
public, what is the pre&s;ence of the greate&s;t
or wi&s;e&s;t man on earth, to that pre&s;ence of
the Divinity which constantly &s;urrounds
us? The man who reali&s;es to his mind
this augu&s;t pre&s;ence, feels a con&s;tant incen|tive
<PB N="201" REF="214">
for acquitting him&s;elf with dignity.
He views him&s;elf as placed on an illu&s;tri|ous
theatre. To have the Almighty for
the &s;pectator and witne&s;s of his conduct,
is more to him than if the whole world
were a&s;&s;embled to ob&s;erve him. Men judge
often fal&s;ely, always imperfectly, of what
pa&s;&s;es before them. They are impo&s;ed on
by &s;pecious appearances; and the artful
carry away the prai&s;e which is due to the
de&s;erving. Even &s;uppo&s;ing them to judge
fairly, we may want the opportunity of
doing ju&s;tice to our character, by any pro|per
di&s;play of it in the &s;ight of the world.
Our &s;ituation may bury in ob&s;curity, tho&s;e
talents and virtues which were intitled to
command the highe&s;t e&s;teem. But he, in
who&s;e pre&s;ence the good man acts, in both
an impartial, and an unerring judge of
worth. No fallacious appearances impo&s;e
on him. No &s;ecret virtue is hidden from
him. He is attentive equally to the mean|e&s;t
and the greate&s;t; and his approbation
confers eternal rewards. The man, there|fore,
who <HI>&s;ets the Lord always before him,</HI>
<PB N="202" REF="215">
is prompted to excel in virtue by motives,
which are peculiar to him&s;elf, and which
engage, on the &s;ide of duty, both honour
and intere&s;t. <HI>I have kept thy precepts, and
thy te&s;timonies; for all my ways are before
thee</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxix. 168.</NOTE></P>
<P>SUPPOSING, however, his virtu&ograve;us en|deavours
to be faithful, many imperfect|tions
will attend them. A faultle&s;s tenor
of unblemi&s;hed life, is beyond the reach of
man. Pa&s;&s;ions will &s;ometimes overcome
him; and ambition or intere&s;t, in an un|guarded
hour, will turn him a&s;ide into e|vil.
Hence, he will be a&s;hamed of him|&s;elf,
and di&s;quieted by a &s;en&s;e of guilt and
folly. In this &s;tate, to which we are often
reduced by the weakne&s;s of human nature,
the belief of God's continual pre&s;ence brings
relief to the heart. It acted before as an
animating principle. It now acts as a prin|ciple
of comfort. In the mid&s;t of many
imperfections, a virtuous man appeals to
his divine witne&s;s, for the &s;incerity of his
<PB N="203" REF="216">
intentions. He can appeal to him who
<HI>knows his frame,</HI> that in the general train
of his conduct, it is his &s;tudy to keep the
law of God.</P>
<P>Mere law, among men, is rigid and
inflexible. As no human lawgiver can
look into the hearts of his &s;ubjects, he
cannot, even though he were ever pre|&s;ent
with them, e&s;timate their character
exactly. He can make no allowance for
particular &s;ituations. He mu&s;t pre&s;cribe
the &s;ame terms to all whom he rules; and
treat all alike, according to their outward
actions. But every minute diver&s;ity of
character, temper, and &s;ituation, is known
to God. It is not only from what his &s;er|vants
do, but from what they &s;eek to do,
that he forms his judgement of them. He
attends to all tho&s;e circum&s;tances which
render the trial of their virtue, at any time,
peculiarly hard. He hears the whi&s;per of
devotion as it ri&s;es in the &s;oul. He beholds
the tear of contrition which falls in &s;ecret.
He &s;ees the good intention &s;truggling in
its birth; and pur&s;ues it, in its progre&s;s,
<PB N="204" REF="217">
through tho&s;e various ob&s;tacles which may
prevent it from ripening into action. Good
men, therefore, in their mo&s;t humbled and
dejected &s;tate, draw &s;ome con&s;olation from
his knowledge of their heart. Though they
may &s;ometimes have erred from the right
path, they can look up to him who is ever
with them, and &s;ay, as an apo&s;tle, who
had grievou&s;ly offended, once &s;aid to his
great Ma&s;ter; <HI>Lord, thou knowe&s;t all things;
thou knowe&s;t that I love thee</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="marg">John, xxi. 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Appealing thus to their omni&s;cient wit|ne&s;s,
they are naturally foothed and encou|raged
by the hope of his clemency. At
the &s;ame time, it is the peculiar advantage
of this &s;entiment of the divine prefence,
that it prevents &s;uch hope from flattering
them too much, or ri&s;ing into undue pre|&s;umption.
For while it encourages, it tends
al&s;o to humble, a pious man. If it encou|rage
him, by the reflection on all his good
di&s;po&s;itions being known and attended to
by God, it humbles him, by the remem|brance,
<PB N="205" REF="218">
that <HI>his &s;ecret &s;ins</HI> al&s;o <HI>are ever in
the light of the divine countenance.</HI> So that, by
dwelling under the &s;en&s;e of God being con|tinually
with us, we keep alive the proper
temper of a Chri&s;tian in the &s;oul; humility,
without dejection; fear, mingled with hope.
We are cheared, without being lifted up.
We feel our&s;elves obnoxious to the all-ob&s;er|ving
eye of ju&s;tice; but are comforted with
the thoughts of that mercy which, through
Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Di&s;cerner of all hearts
holds forth to the &s;incere and penitent.&mdash;
Such are the ble&s;&s;ed effects which this prin|ciple
of religion produces upon the inward
moral &s;tate of a good man. Let us now,</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, con&s;ider his exter|nal
circum&s;tances; and examine the in|fluence
which the &s;ame principle has upon
his happine&s;s, in &s;everal different &s;ituations
of life.</P>
<P>LET us fir&s;t view him in what the world
calls pro&s;perity; when his circum&s;tances
are ea&s;y or affluent, and his life flows in a
<PB N="206" REF="219">
&s;mooth untroubled &s;tream. Here, it might
be thought, that a &s;en&s;e of the divine pre|&s;ence
could operate upon him only, or
chiefly, for promoting temperance, and re|&s;training
the di&s;orders incident to a pro&s;pe|rous
&s;tate. Valuable effects, indeed, the&s;e
are; and mo&s;t conducive to the true enjoy|ment
of all that is agreeable in life. But
though it, doubtle&s;s, does exert this &s;alu|tary
influence, yet it &s;tops not there. It
not only pre&s;erves the virtue of a good man
amid&s;t the temptations of plea&s;ure, but it
gives to his pro&s;perity a &s;ecurity, and a pe|culiar
reli&s;h, which to others is unknown.
He who is without a &s;en&s;e of God upon
his mind, beholds in human affairs nothing
but a perpetual fluctuation, and vici&s;&s;itude
of events. He is &s;urrounded with unknown
cau&s;es, which may be working his de&s;truc|tion
in &s;ecret. He cannot avoid perceiving,
that there hangs over him the irre&s;i&s;tible
arm of that Providence, who&s;e di&s;plea&s;ure
he has done nothing to &s;tay or avert. But
he who, in the day of pro&s;perity, dwells
with God, is delivered from tho&s;e di&s;quiet|ing
<PB N="207" REF="220">
alarms. He dwells as with a friend
and protector, from whom he conceives his
ble&s;&s;ings to proceed. He can appeal to him
for the thankfulne&s;s with which he receives
them; and for his endeavours to employ
them well. He tru&s;ts, that the God whom
he &s;erves will not for&s;ake him; that the
goodne&s;s which he has already experienced,
will continue to ble&s;s him; and though he
believes him&s;elf not exempted from the
changes of the world, yet, in the mid&s;t of
the&s;e, he has ground to hope, that &s;ources
of comfort and happine&s;s &s;hall always be
left open to him.</P>
<P>Moreover, the plea&s;ures of life, while
they la&s;t, are un&s;peakably heightened by
the pre&s;ence of that Benefactor who be|&s;tows
them. The plea&s;ing emotion of gra|titude
to the giver, mingles with the enjoy|ment
of the gift. While to the mere world|ly
man, the whole frame of nature is only
a va&s;t irregular fabric; and the cour&s;e of
human affairs no more than a confu&s;ed &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of fortuitous events; all nature is
beautified, and every agreeable incident is
<PB N="208" REF="221">
enlivened, to him who beholds God in all
things. Hence ari&s;e a variety of plea&s;ing
&s;en&s;ations, to fill up tho&s;e &s;olitary hours, in
which external pro&s;perity &s;upplies him with
no entertainment. In the &s;miling &s;cenes of
nature, he contemplates the benignity of
its author. In its &s;ublime objects, he ad|mires
his maje&s;ty. In its awful and ter|rible
ones, he adores his power. He dwells
in this world as in a magnificent temple,
which is full of the glory of its founder;
and every where views nature offering up
its incen&s;e to him, from a thou&s;and altars.
Such ideas exalt and ennoble the human
mind; and reflect an additional lu&s;tre on
the brightne&s;s of pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>FROM the pro&s;perous, let us next turn to
the afflicted condition of a good man. For,
as pro&s;perity may, affliction certainly will,
at one time or other, be his lot. It enters
into the appointed trial of his virtue; and,
in one degree or other, is the doom of all.
Here we &s;hall find various &s;ituations occur,
in which no relief is equal to what a vir|tuous
<PB N="209" REF="222">
and holy man derives from a &s;en&s;e of
the perpetual pre&s;ence of God.</P>
<P>Is he, for in&s;tance, thrown into an ob&s;cure
condition in the world, without friends
to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, or any to regard and con&s;ider
his &s;tate? He enjoys the &s;atisfaction of
thinking, that though he may be neglected
by men, he is not forgotten by God. In|con&s;iderable
as he is in him&s;elf, he knows,
that he will not be overlooked by the Al|mighty,
amid&s;t the infinite variety of be|ing,
or lo&s;t in the immen&s;ity of his works.
The poor man can, with as much en|couragement
as the rich or great, lift up
his eyes to heaven, and &s;ay, <HI>Neverthele&s;s, O
Lord, I am continually with thee: Thou hold|e&s;t
me by my right hand.</HI> The gracious pre|&s;ence
of that Supreme Being is affected by
no diver&s;ity of rank or fortune. It imparts
it&s;elf alike to all the virtuous and upright;
like its glorious image, the &s;un in the fir|mament,
which &s;heds its rays equally upon
the humble cottage, and upon the palace of
Kings. In the pre&s;ence of the great Lord
of heaven and earth, all the di&s;tinctions
<PB N="210" REF="223">
which vanity has contrived to make among
men, totally di&s;appear. All ranks are on one
level. <HI>The rich and the poor</HI> here indeed
<HI>meet together;</HI> without any other di&s;tinction
than what ari&s;es from the heart and the &s;oul.
The &s;en&s;e of this, lifts the poor man above
contempt; &s;upports his &s;pirits when apt to
be dejected; and be&s;tows dignity on the
part which he acts. How incon&s;iderable
&s;oever that part may appear in the e&s;tima|tion
of an injudicious world, it is ennobled,
when virtuou&s;ly performed, by the appro|bation
of his divine witne&s;s. He can bear
with indifference the &s;corn of the proud,
as long as he knows, that there is one
higher than the highe&s;t to regard him.
He can enjoy him&s;elf with plea&s;ure in
his mean habitation, becau&s;e he believes
that God dwells with him there. The
Divine pre&s;ence chears to him the mo&s;t
lonely retreat. It accompanies his &s;teps to
the mo&s;t di&s;tant regions of the earth. If
he &s;hould be driven into exile from all his
friends, and obliged to <HI>dwell in the utter|mo&s;t
parts of the &s;ea,</HI> even there God's <HI>hand
<PB N="211" REF="224">
would hold him, and his right hand would
guide him.</HI> Though left without compa|nion
or friend, he never thinks him&s;elf de|&s;olate,
as long as he can &s;ay, <HI>I am &s;till with
God.</HI></P>
<P>BUT though rai&s;ed above ob&s;curity or
poverty, yet, in any &s;ituation of fortune, ca|lumny
and reproach may be the lot of the
&s;ervant of God. His good intentions may
be mi&s;con&s;tructed; his character unju&s;tly
traduced; and, to the open reviling of ene|mies,
the more bitter unkindne&s;s of friends
may &s;ometimes be joined. In this &s;itua|tion,
when wounded in &s;pirit, and, per|haps,
unable to make his innocence appear,
to whom &s;hall he have recour&s;e for defence,
to whom make his la&s;t appeal, but to that
God who is ever pre&s;ent with him, and
who knoweth his heart? How frequent|ly,
amid&s;t the inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion of
the world, has di&s;tre&s;&s;ed innocence had no
other relief but this? &startq;God is my wit|ne&s;s.
God is my avenger. He hath &s;een
it; and he will repay.&endq; A good con|&s;cience,
<PB N="212" REF="225">
it is true, is, of it&s;elf, a powerful
&s;upport. But God is Lord of the con|&s;cience;
and it is only when connected
with a &s;en&s;e of divine pre&s;ence and appro|bation,
that a good con&s;cience becomes a
&s;teady principle of fortitude in the mind,
under all di&s;couragements. Hence, a vir|tuous
man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a high degree of inde|pendence,
both on the prai&s;e, and on the
cen&s;ure of the world. It is enough to him,
if, when undergoing the &s;ame reproaches
which Job &s;uffered from his mi&s;taken
friends, he can &s;ay with him, <HI>Behold my
witne&s;s is in heaven, and my record is on
high</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job. xvi. 19.</NOTE> He affects not to divulge his good
deeds to the world. He is without con|cern
whether the world be acquainted with
them, or not. He knoweth, that his <HI>Father
which is in heaven &s;eeth in &s;ecret;</HI> and that
<HI>his prayers and his alms come up</HI> in grateful
<HI>memorial before him. With me, it is a &s;mall
thing to be judged of you, or of man's judge|ment;
he that judgeth me is the Lord</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1. Cor. iv. 3. 4.</NOTE>. <HI>He
<PB N="213" REF="226">
&s;hall bring forth my righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> at la&s;t, <HI>as
the light, and my judgement as the noon day.</HI>
In this con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of integrity, he looks
down with indifference, as from a &s;uperior
&s;tation, upon the har&s;h cen&s;ures of a giddy
and ignorant world. The &s;en&s;e of being
continually with God diffu&s;es over his &s;oul
a holy calm, which unju&s;t reproach cannot
di&s;turb. In the pre&s;ence of that augu&s;t and
venerable witne&s;s, all the noi&s;e and cla|mours
of men, like the murmurings of a di&s;tant &s;torm,
die away.</P>
<P>LASTLY, Suppo&s;ing the character of a
good man to be untainted by reproach,
&s;uppo&s;ing al&s;o his external &s;ituation to be
opulent or di&s;tingui&s;hed, many, notwith|&s;tanding,
and &s;evere, are the di&s;tre&s;&s;es to
which he may be expo&s;ed. Secret griefs
may be preying upon him; and his heart
left to feed in &s;ilence on its own bitterne&s;s.
He may labour under &s;ore di&s;ea&s;e, and di&s;|cern
his earthly frame gradually moulder|ing
into du&s;t. He may be deprived of tho&s;e
friends and relatives who had been the
<PB N="214" REF="227">
chief comforts of his &s;tate; or may be ob|liged
to prepare him&s;elf for taking farewel
of them for over. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e
various afflicting &s;cenes of human life, no
con&s;olation can be more powerful than
what ari&s;es from the pre&s;ence of a divine
protector and guardian, to whom our ca&s;e,
with all its &s;orrows, is perfectly known.
<HI>To him,</HI> &s;ays the p&s;almi&s;t, <HI>I poured out my
complaint. I &s;howed before him my trouble.
I looked on my right hand and viewed; but
behold there was no man who cared for my
&s;oul. I &s;aid unto thee, O Lord, thou art my
refuge. When my &s;pirit was overwhelmed
within me, then thou knewe&s;t my path</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxlii. 2. 3. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We all know, that to communicate our
grief to a faithful friend, often gives ea&s;e
and relief to the burdened heart. Such com|munication
we are encouraged to make, and
&s;uch relief we may expect to find, in pour|ing
out our heart before that God <HI>in whom
compa&s;&s;ions flow.</HI> We may have no earthly
friend to whom we can with full confi|dence
<PB N="215" REF="228">
di&s;clo&s;e all our &s;orrows; or we may
want words in which to expre&s;s them. But
God is the &s;earcher of all hearts; and the
hearer of all prayers. To the &s;ecret an|gui&s;h
of the &s;oul, he is no inattentive wit|ne&s;s.
Every groan which is heaved from the
labouring bo&s;om, though heard by no hu|man
ear, reaches his throne. As he <HI>knows
our frame,</HI> &s;o he <HI>remembers we are du&s;t;</HI> and
thence <HI>light ari&s;es to the upright in dark|ne&s;s.</HI>
For the hope naturally &s;prings, that
this beneficent being will pity them, <HI>as a
father pitieth his children;</HI> and in the mid&s;t
of tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es which the pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances
of man render unavoidable,
will <HI>&s;end them help from his &s;anctuary.</HI> Sur|rounded
with this compa&s;&s;ionate pre&s;ence
of the Almighty, good men never view
them&s;elves as left in this vale of tears, to
bear, &s;olitary and alone, the whole weight
of human woe. In their dark, as well as
in their brighter hours, God is with them.
Even in that valley of the &s;hadow of death,
where no friend, no comforter, can go a|long
to aid them, he is with them &s;till. In
<PB N="216" REF="229">
the la&s;t extremity of nature, <HI>the rod and
&s;taff of the Shepherd of I&s;rael &s;upport them.</HI></P>
<P>THUS I have &s;hown, though in an im|perfect
manner, what benefits holy men
derive from a habitual &s;en&s;e of the divine
pre&s;ence. It animates and &s;trengthens their
virture. It enlivens and brightens their pro|&s;perity.
Under various forms of adver&s;ity,
it affords them con&s;olation and relief.&mdash;
Such con&s;iderations, undoubtedly, form a
&s;trong argument in favour of devout &s;pi|rit,
and a virtuous life. But they are con|&s;iderations
which may, probably, be regard|ed
by &s;ome, as ideal and vi&s;ionary; requiring
aid from a heated, or an enthu&s;ia&s;tic fancy,
in order to give them force. I readily ad|mit,
that amid&s;t the hurry and turbu|lence
of the world, it may be difficult to
bring the&s;e religious &s;entiments as fully in|to
view, as is nece&s;&s;ary for their making a
ju&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;oul. This requires
the effort of an intelligent and feeling
mind; and therefore cannot be expected
to be commonly found. To the unreflect|ing
<PB N="217" REF="230">
crowd, nothing appears real, but what
is expo&s;ed to &s;en&s;e. What is invi&s;ible, is
the &s;ame to them, as if it had no exi&s;tence.
But by the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of their own concep|tions,
they have no title to mea&s;ure tho&s;e of
others. While they affect to treat all con|&s;iderations
taken from the &s;en&s;e of the di|vine
pre&s;ence, as vi&s;ionary and enthu&s;ia&s;|tic,
it can on the contrary, be clearly
&s;hown, that they are founded on the mo&s;t
certain and unque&s;tionable principles of
rea&s;on. They e&s;&s;entially belong not to re|vealed
only, but to natural, religion. Their
reality can be denied by none, but tho&s;e
who deny that God exi&s;ts, or that he go|verns
the world. For, if he exi&s;t, he mu&s;t
undoubtedly pervade and in&s;pect the world
which he governs. He mu&s;t know what
is going on throughout his own univer&s;e;
and e&s;pecially mu&s;t know what pa&s;&s;es with|in
the hearts which he has made, and of
which he is to judge. To be every where
pre&s;ent, is the attribute of his nature,
which, of all others, is the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary
to his admini&s;tration of the univer&s;e. This,
<PB N="218" REF="231">
accordingly, is an attribute which all re|ligions
have a&s;cribed to him. All nations
have believed in it. All &s;ocieties appeal to
it, in the &s;olemnities of an oath, by which
they determine controver&s;ies. This attri|bute
being once admitted to belong to the
Deity, the con&s;equences which I have de|duced
from it, plainly and naturally fol|low:
And every good man has ground to
&s;ay, <HI>O Lord, I am continually with thee.</HI></P>

<P>THE <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our &s;ouls</HI> is a very em|phatical
expre&s;&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XI.</NOTE> It de&s;cribes that

of him&s;elf; in oppo&s;ition to his undergo|ing
&s;ome inward agitation which di&s;com|po&s;es
his powers. Upon the lea&s;t reflec|tion,
it mu&s;t appear, how e&s;&s;ential &s;uch a

<PB N="220" REF="233">
&s;elf-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the mo&s;t important requi&s;ite
is, the habitual exerci&s;e of patience.</P>
<P>I know that patience is apt to be ranked
by many, among the more humble and
ob&s;cure virtues; belonging chiefly to tho&s;e
who groan on a &s;ick-bed, or who langui&s;h in
a pri&s;on. If their &s;ituation be, happily, of a
different kind, they imagine that there is
no occa&s;ion for the di&s;cipline of patience
being preached to them. But I hope to
make it appear, that, in every circum&s;tance
of life, no virtue is more important, both
to duty and to happine&s;s; or more requi|&s;ite
for forming a manly and worthy cha|racter.
It is not confined to a &s;ituation of
continued adver&s;ity. It principally, in|deed,
regards the di&s;agreeable circum|&s;tances
which are apt to occur. But, in
our pre&s;ent &s;tate, the occurrence of the&s;e
is &s;o frequent, that, in every condition of
life, patience is ince&s;&s;antly called forth.
Pro&s;perity cannot be enjoyed, any more
than adver&s;ity &s;upported, without it. It
mu&s;t enter into the temper, and form the
habit of the &s;oul, if we would pa&s;s through
<PB N="221" REF="234">
the world with tranquillity and honour.
What I purpo&s;e is, to point out &s;ome of
the chief occa&s;ions on which patience is re|quired;
and to recommend and enforce
the exerci&s;e of it, in order to <HI>our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
our &s;ouls.</HI></P>
<P>I. PATIENCE under provocations. The
wide circle of human &s;ociety is diver&s;ified
by an endle&s;s variety of characters, di&s;po|&s;itions,
and pa&s;&s;ions. Uniformity is, in no
re&s;pect the genius of the world. Every
man is marked by &s;ome peculiarity which
di&s;tingui&s;hes him from another: and no
where can two individuals be found who
are exactly, and in all re&s;pects, alike.
Where &s;o much diver&s;ity obtains, it can|not
but happen, that, in the intercour&s;e
which men are obliged to maintain, their
tempers &s;hall often be ill adju&s;ted to that
intercour&s;e; &s;hall jar, and interfere with
each other. Hence, in every &s;tation, the
highe&s;t as well as the lowe&s;t, and in every
condition of life, public, private, and dome|&s;tic,
occa&s;ions of irritation frequently ari&s;e.
<PB N="222" REF="235">
We are provoked, &s;ometimes, by the folly
and levity of tho&s;e with whom we are con|nected;
&s;ometimes, by their indifference or
neglect; by the incivility of a friend, the
haughtine&s;s of a &s;uperior, or the in&s;olent
behaviour of one in lower &s;tation. Hardly
a day pa&s;&s;es, without &s;omewhat or other oc|curring,
which &s;erves to ruffle the man of im|patient
&s;pirit. Of cour&s;e, &s;uch a man lives
in a continual &s;torm. He knows not what
it is to enjoy a train of good humour.
Servants, neighbours, friends, &s;pou&s;e, and
children, all, through the unre&s;trained vio|lence
of his temper, become &s;ources of di|&s;turbance
and vexation to him. In vain
is affluence; in vain are health and pro&s;pe|rity.
The lea&s;t trifle is &s;ufficient to di&s;|compo&s;e
his mind, and poi&s;on his plea|&s;ures.
His very amu&s;ements are mixed
with turbulence and pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I would be&s;eech this man to con&s;ider, of
what &s;mall moment the provocations which
he receives, or at lea&s;t imagines him&s;elf to
receive, are really in them&s;elves; but of
what great moment he makes them, by
<PB N="223" REF="236">
&s;uffering them to deprive him of the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of him&s;elf. I would be&s;eech him,
to con&s;ider, how many hours of happine&s;s
he throws away, which a little more pa|tience
would allow him to enjoy; and how
much he puts it in the power of the mo&s;t
in&s;ignificant per&s;ons to render him mi&s;e|rable.
&startq;But who can expect,&endq; we hear him
exclaim, &startq;that he is to po&s;&s;e&s;s the in&s;en&s;i|bility
of a &s;tone? How is it po&s;&s;ible for
human nature to endure &s;o many re|peated
provocations? or to bear calmly
with &s;uch unrea&s;onable behaviour?&endq;&mdash;
My brother! if you can bear with no in|&s;tances
of unrea&s;onable behaviour, with|draw
your&s;elf from the world. You are
no longer fit to live in it. Leave the in|tercour&s;e
of men. Retreat to the moun|tain,
and the de&s;ert; or &s;hut your&s;elf up
in a cell. For here, in the mid&s;t of &s;o|ciety,
<HI>offences mu&s;t come.</HI> You might as well
expect, when you beheld a calm atmo|&s;phere,
and a clear &s;ky, that no clouds were
ever to ri&s;e, and no winds to blow, as that
your life was long to proceed, without re|ceiving
<PB N="224" REF="237">
provocations from human frailty.
The carele&s;s and the imprudent, the giddy
and the fickle, the ungrateful and the in|tere&s;ted,
every where meet us. They are
the briars and the thorns, with which the
paths of human life are be&s;et. He only
who can hold his cour&s;e among them with
patience and equanimity, he who is pre|pared
to bear what he mu&s;t expert to hap|pen,
is worthy of the name of a man.</P>
<P>Did you only pre&s;erve your&s;elf compo|&s;ed
for a moment, you would perceive the
in&s;ignificancy of mo&s;t of tho&s;e provocations
which you magnify &s;o highly. When a few
&s;uns more have rolled over your head, the
&s;torm will have, of it&s;elf, &s;ub&s;ided; the cau&s;e
of your pre&s;ent impatience and di&s;turbance
will be utterly forgotten. Can you not, then,
anticipate this hour of calmne&s;s to your|&s;elf;
and begin to enjoy the peace which
it will certainly bring? If others have be|haved
improperly, leave them to their own
folly, without becoming the victim of their
caprice, and puni&s;hing your&s;elf on their
account.&mdash;Patience, in this exerci&s;e of it,
<PB N="225" REF="238">
cannot be too much &s;tudied by all who
wi&s;h their life to flow in a &s;mooth &s;tream.
It is the rea&s;on of a man, in oppo&s;ition to
the pa&s;&s;ion of a child. It is the enjoyment
of peace, in oppo&s;ition to uproar and con|fu&s;ion.
<HI>He that hath no rule over his own
&s;pirit, is like a city that is broken down, and
without walls</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxv. 28.</NOTE>.&mdash;The next important ex|erci&s;e
of patience is,</P>
<P>II. PATIENCE under di&s;appointments.
The&s;e will often happen to the be&s;t and
wi&s;e&s;t men; &s;ometimes, to the wi&s;e&s;t and
be&s;t concerted plans. They may happen,
too, not through any imprudence of tho&s;e
who have devi&s;ed the plan, not even
through the malice or ill de&s;ign of others;
but merely in con&s;equence of &s;ome of tho&s;e
cro&s;s incidents of life which could not be
fore&s;een. On &s;uch occa&s;ions, per&s;ons of a
warm and &s;anguine temper are pre&s;ently in
a ferment. They had formed their hopes,
as they think, upon the ju&s;te&s;t grounds.
<PB N="226" REF="239">
They had waited long for &s;ucce&s;s; and
borne with many delays. But when their
de&s;igns are brought to &s;o unexpected an
i&s;&s;ue; when, without any fault of their
own, they find their hopes finally bla&s;ted,
all patience for&s;akes them; they no longer
po&s;&s;e&s;s their &s;ouls; the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate ex|clamations
break forth. &startq;To whom, ex|cept
to them, could &s;uch a di&s;appoint|ment
have happened? Since the creation
of the world, was &s;uch a combination of
di&s;a&s;trous incidents ever beheld? Why
are they doomed to be &s;o unfortunate
beyond all others?&endq;&mdash;Alas! how un|&s;kilfully
have you calculated the cour&s;e of
human events? How ra&s;hly and pre&s;ump|tuou&s;ly
had you tru&s;ted to &s;ucce&s;s? To
whom was it ever given, to guard again&s;t
all the vici&s;&s;itudes, which the fluctuating
<HI>fa&s;hion of the world</HI> is ince&s;&s;antly bringing
about? If one friend, to whom you look|ed
up, has died, or another has lo&s;t his in|fluence
and power; if the opinion of the
public is changed, and its favour has been
withdrawn; if &s;ome mi&s;takes have occur|red
<PB N="227" REF="240">
to le&s;&s;en the good will of a patron on
whom you depended; if, through the con|currence
of the&s;e, or &s;uch like circum|&s;tances,
a more fortunate rival has prevail|ed
again&s;t you; what is there in all this,
that differs from the ordinary lot of man?
Are we not, each in his turn, doomed to
experience the uncertainty of worldly pur|&s;uits?
Why, then, aggravate our misfor|tunes
by the unrea&s;onable violence of an
impatient &s;pirit? If our de&s;igns have fail|ed
through ra&s;hne&s;s or mi&s;conduct, let
us blame our&s;elves. If they have failed
through circum&s;tances which we could not
prevent, let us &s;ubmit to the fate of man;
and wait, with patience, till a more favour|able
opportunity &s;hall occur of regaining
&s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, let us turn to the other &s;ide
of the pro&s;pect; and calmly con&s;ider how
dubious it was, whether the &s;ucce&s;s which
we longed for, would have proved a ble&s;|&s;ing.
<HI>Who knoweth what is good for man
in this life?</HI> Perhaps, the accompli&s;hment
of our de&s;igns might have been pregnant
<PB N="228" REF="241">
with mi&s;ery. Perhaps, from our pre&s;ent
di&s;appointment, future pro&s;perity may ri&s;e.
Of &s;uch unlooked for i&s;&s;ues, we all know
there have been many examples. Who can
tell, whether our ca&s;e may not add one to the
number?&mdash;At any rate, let us recollect,
that there is a Supreme Ruler, who di&s;po&s;es
of the affairs of men; under whom, all &s;e|cond
cau&s;es work only as &s;ubordinate a|gents.
Looking up to that irre&s;i&s;tible arm
which is &s;tretched over our heads, let us
be calm; let us &s;ubmit and adore. Either
to de&s;pair, or to rage, under di&s;appoint|ments,
is &s;inful. By the former, we injure
our&s;elves. By the latter, we in&s;ult Provi|dence,
and provoke its di&s;plea&s;ure to con|tinue.
<HI>To po&s;&s;e&s;s our &s;ouls in patience</HI> is, at
once, our wi&s;dom as men, and our duty
as Chri&s;tians. The benefits of this virtue
are &s;o often reaped in this world, that
good policy alone would recommend it to
every thinking man. Di&s;appointments de|range,
and overcome, vulgar minds. The
patient and the wi&s;e, by a proper improve|ment,
frequently make them contribute to
<PB N="229" REF="242">
their high advantage.&mdash;Let me next recom|mend,</P>
<P>III. PATIENCE under re&s;traints. Nu|merous
are the re&s;traints impo&s;ed on us, by
the nature of the human condition. To
the re&s;traints of authority and law, all
mu&s;t &s;ubmit. The re&s;traints of education
and di&s;cipline lie on the young. Con&s;i|derations
of health re&s;train the indulgence
of plea&s;ure. Attentions to fortune re&s;train
expence. Regard to friends, whom we are
bound to plea&s;e; re&s;pect to e&s;tabli&s;hed cu|&s;toms,
and to the opinions of &s;ociety, im|po&s;e
re&s;traints on our general behaviour.
There is no man, in any rank of life, who
is always at liberty to act according as he
would incline. In &s;ome quarter or other,
he is limited by circum&s;tances, that either
actually confine, or that ought at lea&s;t to
confine and re&s;train him.</P>
<P>The&s;e re&s;traints, the impatient are apt to
&s;corn. They will needs bur&s;t the barriers
which rea&s;on had erected, or their &s;itua|tion
had formed; and without regard to
<PB N="230" REF="243">
con&s;equences, give free &s;cope to their pre|&s;ent
wi&s;h. Hence, many dangerous ex|ce&s;&s;es
flow; much confu&s;ion and mi&s;ery
are produced in human life. Had men
the patience to &s;ubmit to their condition,
and to wait till it &s;hould allow them a
freer indulgence of their de&s;ires, they
might, in a &s;hort time, obtain the power
of gratifying them with &s;afety. If the
young, for in&s;tance, would undergo, with
patience, the labours of education, they would
ri&s;e, at a proper period, to honours,
riches, or ea&s;e. If the infirm would, with
patience, bear the regulations which their
con&s;titution demands, they might regain
the comforts of health. If per&s;ons of &s;trait|ened
fortune had patience to conform them|&s;elves
to their circum&s;tances, and to abridge
their plea&s;ures, they might, by degrees, im|prove
and advance their &s;tate. Whereas,
by eagerne&s;s of temper, and precipitancy
of indulgence, they forfeit all the advan|tages

and incur the oppo&s;ite evils to their

IN the pre&s;ent &s;tate of human affairs,
no le&s;&s;on is more nece&s;&s;ary to be learned
by all, to be inculcated on the young, and
to be practi&s;ed by the old, than that of
patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to nece&s;&s;ity. For under
the law of nece&s;&s;ity, we are all inevitably
placed. No man is, or can be, always his
own ma&s;ter. We are obliged, in a thou|&s;and
ca&s;es, to &s;ubmit and obey. The di&s;|cipline
of patience pre&s;erves our minds ea|&s;y,
by conforming them to our &s;tate. By
the impetuo&s;ity of an impatient and un|&s;ubmitting
temper, we fight again&s;t an un|conquerable
power; and aggravate the e|vils
we mu&s;t endure.&mdash;Another important
exerci&s;e of the virtue concerning which
we di&s;cour&s;e, is,</P>
<P>IV. PATIENCE under injuries and
wrongs. To the&s;e, amid&s;t the pre&s;ent con|fu&s;ion
of the world, all are expo&s;ed. No
&s;tation is &s;o high, no power &s;o great, no
character &s;o unblemi&s;hed, as to exempt
men from being attacked by ra&s;hne&s;s, ma|lice,
or envy. To behave under &s;uch at|tacks
<PB N="232" REF="245">
with due patience and moderation,
is, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, one of the mo&s;t
trying exerci&s;es of virtue.&mdash;But, in order
to prevent mi&s;takes on this &s;ubject, it is
nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that a tame &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion
to wrongs is not required by religion.
We are, by no means, to imagine, that re|ligion
tends to extingui&s;h the &s;en&s;e of ho|nour,
or to &s;uppre&s;s the exertion of a man|ly-&s;pirit.
It is under a fal&s;e apprehen&s;ion
of this kind, that Chri&s;tian patience is
&s;ometimes &s;tigmati&s;ed in di&s;cour&s;e, as no
other than a different name for cowardice.
On the contrary, every man of virtue
ought to feel what is due to his character,
and to &s;upport properly his own rights.
Re&s;entment of wrong, is an u&s;eful principle
in human nature; and for the wi&s;e&s;t pur|po&s;es,
was implanted in our frame. It is
the nece&s;&s;ary guard of private rights; and
the great re&s;traint on the in&s;olence of the
violent, who, if no re&s;i&s;tance were made,
would trample on the gentle and peace|able.</P>
<P>Re&s;entment, however, if not kept with|in
<PB N="233" REF="246">
due bounds, is in hazard of ri&s;ing into
fierce and cruel revenge. It is the office of
patience, to temper re&s;entment by rea&s;on.
In this view, it is mo&s;t properly de&s;cribed in
the text, by a man's <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing his &s;oul;</HI> acting
the part which &s;elf-defence, which ju&s;tice, or
honour, require him to act, without being
tran&s;ported out of him&s;elf by the vehe|mence
of anger; or in&s;i&s;ting on &s;uch de|grees
of reparation as bear no proportion
to the wrong that he has &s;uffered. What
proportion, for in&s;tance, is there between
the life of a man, and an affront received
by &s;ome ra&s;h expre&s;&s;ion in conver&s;ation,
which the wi&s;e would have &s;lighted; and
which, in the cour&s;e of a few weeks, would
have been forgotten by every one? How
fanta&s;tic, then, how unju&s;tifiable, are tho&s;e
&s;uppo&s;ed laws of modern honour, which
for &s;uch an affront, require no le&s;s repara|tion
than the death of a fellow-creature;
and which, to obtain this reparation, re|quire
a man to endanger his own life?
Laws, which as they have no foundation
in rea&s;on, never received the lea&s;t &s;anction
<PB N="234" REF="247">
from any of the wi&s;e and poli&s;hed nations
of antiquity; but were devi&s;ed in the
darke&s;t ages of the world, and are derived
to us from the ferocious barbarity of Go|thic
manners.</P>
<P>Nothing is &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;elf-po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
as violent anger. It overpowers
rea&s;on; confounds our ideas; di&s;torts the
appearance, and blackens the colour, of
every object. By the &s;torm which it rai&s;es
within, and by the mi&s;chiefs which it oc|ca&s;ions
without, it generally brings on the
pa&s;&s;ionate and revengeful man, greater mi|&s;ery
than he can bring on his enemy. Pa|tience
allays this de&s;tructive tempe&s;t, by
making room for the return of calm and
&s;ober thought. It &s;u&s;pends the blow which
&s;udden re&s;entment was ready to inflict. It
di&s;po&s;es us to attend to the alleviating cir|cum&s;tances,
which may be di&s;covered in
the mid&s;t of the wrongs we &s;uppo&s;e our|&s;elves
to have &s;uffered. Hence, it natural|ly
inclines us to the moderate and gentle
&s;ide; and while it allows all proper mea|&s;ures
to be taken, both for &s;afety, and for
<PB N="235" REF="248">
ju&s;t redre&s;s, it makes way for returning
peace. Without &s;ome degree of patience
exerci&s;ed under injuries, human life would
be rendered a &s;tate of perpetual ho&s;tility;
offences and retaliations would &s;ucceed to
one another in endle&s;s train; and the world
would become a field of blood.&mdash;It now
remains to recommend,</P>
<P>V. PATIENCE under adver&s;ity and af|fliction.
This is the mo&s;t common &s;en&s;e
in which this virtue is under&s;tood; as it
re&s;pects di&s;ea&s;e, poverty, old age, lo&s;s of
friends, and the other calamities which are
incident to human life. <HI>Though a man live
many years, and rejoice in them all, yet let
him remember the days of darkne&s;s, for they
&s;hall be many</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. xi. 8.</NOTE> The various duties to
which patience, under this view, gives ri&s;e,
afford a larger &s;ubject to di&s;cour&s;e than I
am at pre&s;ent to pur&s;ue. In general, there
are two chief exerci&s;es of patience under
adver&s;ity; one re&s;pecting God, and another
re&s;pecting men.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="249">
Patience, with re&s;pect to God, mu&s;t, in
in the days of trouble, &s;uppre&s;s the ri&s;ings
of a murmuring and rebellious &s;pirit. It
mu&s;t appear in that calm re&s;ignation to the
will of Heaven, which is expre&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e
pious &s;entiments of ancient good men: <HI>I
was dumb: I opened not my mouth, becau&s;e
thou did&s;t it. It is the Lord, let him do what
&s;eemeth good in his eyes. Shall the receive
good at the hand of the Lord, and &s;hall we
not receive evil al&s;o?</HI> This is loyalty to the
great Governor of the univer&s;e. This is
that reverence which &s;o well becomes crea|tures
who know they are dependent, and
who mu&s;t confe&s;s them&s;elves to be &s;inful.
Such a &s;pirit is fitted to attract the favour
of Heaven; and to bring the &s;evere vi&s;ita|tion
&s;ooner to a clo&s;e. Whereas the &s;tub|born
and impatient, who &s;ubmit not them|&s;elves
to the decrees of the Mo&s;t High, re|quire
to be humbled and &s;ubdued by a
continuance of cha&s;ti&s;ement.</P>
<P>Patience in adver&s;ity, with re&s;pect to
men, mu&s;t appear by the compo&s;ure and
tranquillity of our behaviour. The loud
<PB N="237" REF="250">
complaint, the querulous temper, and fret|ful
&s;pirit, di&s;grace every character. They
&s;how a mind that is unmanned by misfor|tunes.
We weaken thereby the &s;ympathy
of others; and e&s;trange them from the of|fices
of kindne&s;s and comfort. The exer|tions
of pity will be feeble, when it is
mingled with contempt. At the &s;ame time,
by thus weakly yielding to adver&s;ity, we
allow its weight to bear us down with
double pre&s;&s;ure. Patience, by pre&s;erving
compo&s;ure within, re&s;i&s;ts the impre&s;&s;ion
which trouble makes from without. By
leaving the mind open to every con&s;olation,
it naturally tends to alleviate our burden.
&mdash;To maintain a &s;teady and unbroken
mind, amid&s;t all the &s;hocks of the world,
forms the highe&s;t honour of a man. Pa|tience,
on &s;uch occa&s;ions, ri&s;es to magna|nimity.
It &s;hows a great and noble mind,
which is able to re&s;t on it&s;elf, on God, and
a good con&s;cience; which can enjoy it&s;elf
amid&s;t all evils; and would rather endure
the greate&s;t hard&s;hips, than &s;ubmit to what
was di&s;honourable, in order to obtain re|lief.
<PB N="238" REF="251">
This gives proof of a &s;trength that
is derived from Heaven. It is a beam of
the Immortal Light, &s;hining on the heart.
Such patience, is the mo&s;t complete triumph
of religion and virtue; and accordingly it
has ever characteri&s;ed tho&s;e who&s;e names
have been tran&s;mitted with honour to po&s;|terity.
It has ennobled the hero, the &s;aint,
and the martyr. <HI>We are troubled on every
&s;ide, yet not di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; we are perplexed, but
not in de&s;pair; per&s;ecuted, but not for&s;aken;
ca&s;t down, but not de&s;troyed</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv. 8. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS I have traced Patience through
&s;everal of its mo&s;t important operations, in
different circum&s;tances of life; under pro|vocations;
under di&s;appointments; under
re&s;traints; under injuries; and under af|flictions.
We now &s;ee, that it is a virtue
of univer&s;al u&s;e. No man, in any condi|tion,
can pa&s;s his days with tolerable com|fort,
who has not learned to practi&s;e it.
His pro&s;perity will be continually di&s;trub|ed;
<PB N="239" REF="252">
and his adver&s;ity will be clouded with
double darkne&s;s. He will be unea&s;y and
trouble&s;ome to all with whom he is con|nected;
and will be more trouble&s;ome
to him&s;elf than to any other.&mdash;Let me
particularly advi&s;e tho&s;e who wi&s;h to cul|tivate
&s;o nece&s;&s;ary a virtue, to begin their
cultivation of it, on occa&s;ions when &s;mall
offences and provocations ari&s;e. It is a
great, but common, error to imagine, that
we are at liberty to give loo&s;e reins to tem|per,
among the trivial occurrences of life.
No excu&s;e for irritation and impatience can
be wor&s;e, than what is taken from the per|&s;on
being incon&s;iderable, or the incident
being &s;light, which threw us off our guard.
With incon&s;iderable per&s;ons we are &s;ur|rounded.
Of &s;light incidents, the bulk of
human life is compo&s;ed. In the mid&s;t of
the&s;e, the ruling temper of the mind is
formed. It is only by moderation and &s;elf-command
then acquired, that we can inure
our&s;elves to patience, when the great con|junctures
of life &s;hall put it to a &s;everer
trial. If neglected then, we &s;hall after|wards
<PB N="240" REF="253">
&s;olicit its return in vain. <HI>If thou
ha&s;t run with footmen, and they have wea|ried
thee, how can&s;t thou contend with hor&s;es?
and if in the land of peace, wherein thou
tru&s;ted&s;t, they wearied thee, then how wilt
thou do in the &s;wellings of Jordan</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Jer. xii. 5.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>IN order to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the acqui&s;ition of
this grace, let us often contemplate that
great model of it, which is di&s;played in the
whole life of our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.
Who&s;e temper was ever tried by more fre|quent
provocations, more repeated di&s;ap|pointments,
more flagrant injuries, or more
&s;evere di&s;tre&s;s? Yet, amid&s;t them all,
we behold him patiently enduring <HI>the contra|diction
of &s;inners;</HI> to their rudene&s;s,
oppo|&s;ing a mild and unruffled, though firm,
&s;pirit; and, in the cau&s;e of mankind, gene|rou&s;ly
bearing with ever indignity. Well
might he &s;ay, <HI>Learn of me, for I am meek
and lowly in heartgggg</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matth. xi. 29.</NOTE>. Having &s;uch a high
example before our eyes, let us be a&s;hamed
<PB N="241" REF="254">
of tho&s;e &s;allies of impatience which we &s;o
often &s;uffer to break forth, in the mid&s;t of
pro&s;perity. By a more manly tranquillity
and &s;elf-command, let us di&s;cover to the
world, that, as men, and as Chri&s;tians,
we have learned <HI>in patience to po&s;&s;e&s;s our &s;ouls.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="244" REF="257">
I. MODERATION in our wi&s;hes. The
active mind of man &s;eldom or never re&s;ts
&s;atisfied with its pre&s;ent condition, how
pro&s;perous &s;oever. Originally formed for
a wider range of objects, for a higher &s;phere
of enjoyments, it finds it&s;elf, in every &s;i|tuation
of fortune, &s;traitened and confi|ned.
Sen&s;ible of deficiency in its &s;tate, it
is ever &s;ending forth the fond de&s;ire, the
a&s;piring wi&s;h, after &s;omething beyond what
is enjoyed at pre&s;ent. Hence, that re&s;tle&s;&s;|ne&s;s
which prevails &s;o generally among
mankind. Hence, that di&s;gu&s;t of plea&s;ures
which they have tried; that pa&s;&s;ion for
novelty; that ambition of ri&s;ing to &s;ome
degree of eminence or felicity, of which
they have formed to them&s;elves an indi&s;|tinct
idea. All which may be con&s;idered
as indications of a certain native, original
greatne&s;s in the human &s;oul, &s;welling be|yond
the limits of its pre&s;ent condition;
and pointing at the higher objects for
which it was made. Happy, if the&s;e latent
remains of our primitive &s;tate &s;erved to di|rect
our wi&s;hes towards their proper de&s;ti|nation,
<PB N="245" REF="258">
and to lead us into the path of true
bli&s;s!</P>
<P>But in this dark and bewildered &s;tate,
the a&s;piring tendency of our nature unfor|tunately
takes an oppo&s;ite direction, and
feeds a very mi&s;placed ambition. The
flattering appearances which here pre&s;ent
them&s;elves to &s;en&s;e; the di&s;tinctions which
fortune confers; the advantages and plea|&s;ures
which we imagine the world to be
capable be&s;towing, fill up the ultimate
wi&s;h of mo&s;t men. The&s;e are the objects
which ingro&s;s their &s;olitary mu&s;ings, and
&s;timulate their active labours; which warm
the brea&s;ts of the young, animate the in|du&s;try
of the middle aged, and often keep
alive the pa&s;&s;ions of the old, until the very
clo&s;e of life. A&s;&s;uredly, there is nothing
unlawful in our wi&s;hing to be freed from
whatever is di&s;agreeable, and to obtain a
fuller enjoyment of the comforts of life.
But when the&s;e wi&s;hes are not tempered by
rea&s;on, they are in danger of precipitating
us into much extravagance and folly. De|&s;ire
and wi&s;hes are the fir&s;t &s;prings of ac|tion.
<PB N="246" REF="259">
When they become exorbitant, the
whole character is likely to be tainted. If
we &s;uffer our fancy to create to it&s;elf, worlds
of ideal happine&s;s; if we feed our imagi|nation,
with plans of opulence and &s;plendor
far beyond our rank; if we fix to our
wi&s;hes certain &s;tages of high advancement,
or certain degrees of uncommon reputation
or di&s;tinction, as the &s;ole &s;tations of feli|city;
the a&s;&s;ured con&s;equence will be, that
we &s;hall become unhappy in our pre&s;ent
&s;tate; unfit for acting the part, and di&s;|charging
the duties that belong to it; we
&s;hall di&s;compo&s;e the peace and order of our
minds, and foment many hurtful pa&s;&s;ions.
Here, then, let Moderation begin its reign;
by bringing within rea&s;onable bounds the
wi&s;hes that we form. As &s;oon as they be|come
extravagant, let us check them, by
proper reflections on the fallacious nature
of tho&s;e objects, which the world hangs out
to allure de&s;ire.</P>
<P>You have &s;trayed, my friends, from the
road which conducts to felicity; you have
di&s;honoured the native dignity of your
<PB N="247" REF="260">
&s;ouls, in allowing your wi&s;hes to terminate
on nothing higher than worldly ideas of
greatne&s;s or happine&s;s. Your imagination
roves in a land of &s;hadows. Unreal forms
deceive you. It is no more than a phan|tom,
an illu&s;ion of happine&s;s, which at|tracts
your fond admiration; nay, an illu|&s;ion
of happine&s;s, which often conceals
much real mi&s;ery. Do you imagine, that
all are happy, who have attained to tho&s;e
&s;ummits of di&s;tinction, towards which your
wi&s;hes a&s;pire? Alas! how frequently has
experience &s;hewed, that where ro&s;es were
&s;uppo&s;ed to bloom, nothing but briars and
thorns grew? Reputation, beauty, riches,
grandeur, nay, royalty it&s;elf, would, many
a time, have been gladly exchanged by the
po&s;&s;essors, for that more quiet and humble
&s;tation, with which your are now di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied.
With all that is &s;plendid and &s;hining
in the world, it is decreed that there &s;hould
mix many deep &s;hades of woe. On the e|levated
&s;ituations of fortune, the great ca|lamities
of life chiefly fall. There the &s;torm
&s;pends its violence, and there the thunder
<PB N="248" REF="261">
breaks; while &s;afe and unhurt, the inhabit|ant
of the vale remains below.&mdash;Retreat,
then, from tho&s;e vain and pernicious excur|&s;ions
of extravagant de&s;ire. Satisfy your|&s;elves
with what is rational and attainable.
Train your minds to moderate views of
human life, and human happine&s;s. Re|member,
and admire, the wi&s;dom of Agur's
wi&s;h. <HI>Remove far from we vanity and lies.
Give me neither poverty nor riches. Feed me
with food convenient for me: Le&s;t I be full,

le&s;t I be poor, and &s;teal, and take the name of
my God in vain</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxx. 8. 9.</NOTE>.&mdash;Let me recommend,</P>
<P>II. MODERATION in our pur&s;uits.
Wi&s;hes and de&s;ires re&s;t within. If immo|derate
and improper, though they taint
the heart, yet &s;ociety may not be affected
by them. The ob&s;cure and harmle&s;s in|dividual
may indulge his dreams, without
di&s;turbing the public peace. But when
the active pur&s;uits in which we engage,
<PB N="249" REF="262">
ri&s;e beyond moderation, they fill the world
with great di&s;orders; often with flagrant
crimes. This admonition chiefly re&s;pects
the ambitious men of the world. I &s;ay not,
that all ambition is to be condemned; or
that high pur&s;uits ought, on every occa|&s;ion,
to be checked. Some men are form|ed
by nature, for ri&s;ing into con&s;picuous
&s;tations of life. In following the impul&s;e
of their minds, and properly exerting the
talents with which God has ble&s;&s;ed them,
there is room for ambition to act in a lau|dable
&s;phere, and to become the in&s;tru|ment
of much public good. But this may
&s;afely be pronounced that the bulk of
men are ready to over-rate their own abi|lities,
and to imagine them&s;elves equal to
higher things than they were ever de&s;ign|ed
for by nature. Be &s;ober, therefore, in
fixing your aims, and planning your de|&s;tined
pur&s;uits. Beware of being led a|&s;ide
from the plain path of &s;ound and mo|derate
conduct, by tho&s;e fal&s;e lights which
&s;elf-flattery is always ready to hang out.
By aiming at a mark too high, you may

fall &s;hort of what it was within your

to deri&s;ion; nay, may bring upon
your heads manifold di&s;a&s;ters. <HI>I &s;ay to
every man that is among you, not to think of
him&s;elf more highly than he ought to think,
but to think &s;oberly</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xii. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Whatever your aims be, there is one ex|erci&s;e
of moderation which mu&s;t be en|joined
to tho&s;e of the greate&s;t abilities, as
well as to others; that is, never to tran&s;|gre&s;s
the bounds of moral duty. Amid&s;t
the warmth of pur&s;uit, accu&s;tom your|&s;elves

which regard to reputation and cha|racter,
impo&s;e. Think not, that there are
no barriers which ought to &s;top your pro|gre&s;s.
It is from a violent and impetuous
&s;pirit that all the evils &s;pring, which are
&s;o often found to accompany ambition.
Hence, in private life, the laws of truth
<PB N="251" REF="264">
and honour are violated. Hence, in pu|blic
conte&s;ts, the peace and welfare of na|tions
have been &s;o often &s;acrificed to the
ambitious projects of the great. The man
of moderation, as he is temperate in his
wi&s;hes, &s;o in his pur&s;uits he is regulated
by virtue. A good con&s;cience is to him
more valuable than any &s;ucce&s;s. He is
not &s;o much bent on the accompli&s;hment
of any de&s;ign, as to take a di&s;honourable
&s;tep, in order to compa&s;s it. He can have
patience. He can brook di&s;appointments.
He can yield to un&s;urmountable ob&s;tacles;
and, by gentle and gradual progre&s;s, is
more likely to &s;ucceed in the end, than
others are, by violence and impetuo&s;ity. In
his highe&s;t enterpri&s;e, he wi&s;hes not to

a&s;toni&s;hes the public, by its blazing, ec|centric
cour&s;e; but rather to re&s;emble tho&s;e
&s;teady luminaries of heaven, which ad|vance

<P>III. BE moderate in your expectations.
When your &s;tate is flouri&s;hing, and the

lifted up. Flatter not your&s;elves with high
pro&s;pects of the increa&s;ing favours of the
world, and the continuing applau&s;e of men.
Say not within your hearts, <HI>My mountain
&s;tands &s;trong, and &s;hall never be moved. I
&s;hall never &s;ee adver&s;ity. To-morrow &s;hall
be as this day, and more abundantly.</HI>&mdash;You
are betraying your&s;elves; you are laying a
&s;ure foundation of di&s;appointment and mi|&s;ery,
when you allow your fancy to &s;oar
to &s;uch lofty pinnacles of confident hope.
By building your hou&s;e in this airy region,
you are preparing for your&s;elves a great
and cruel fall. Your <HI>tru&s;t is the &s;pider's
web.</HI> You <HI>may lean on your hou&s;e; but it
&s;hall not &s;tand. You may hold it fa&s;t; but it
<PB N="253" REF="266">
&s;hall not endure.</HI> For, to man on earth it
was never granted, to gratify all his hopes;
or to per&s;evere in one tract of uninterrup|ted
pro&s;perity. Unplea&s;ing vici&s;&s;itudes ne|ver
fail to &s;ucceed tho&s;e that were grateful.
<HI>The fa&s;hion of the world,</HI> how gay or &s;mi|ling
&s;oever, <HI>po&s;&s;eth,</HI> and often pa&s;&s;eth &s;ud|denly,
<HI>away.</HI></P>
<P>By want of moderation in our hopes,
we not only increa&s;e dejection, when di&s;|appointment
comes, but we accelerate di&s;|appointment;
we bring forward, with great|er
&s;peed, di&s;agreeable changes in our &s;tate.
For the natural con&s;equence of pre&s;ump|tuous
expectation, is ra&s;hne&s;s in conduct.
He who indulges confident &s;ecurity, of
cour&s;e neglects due precautions again&s;t the
dangers that threaten him; and his fall
will be fore&s;een, and predicted. He not
only expo&s;es him&s;elf unguarded to dan|gers,
but he multiplies them again&s;t him|&s;elf.
By pre&s;umption and vanity, he either
provokes enmity, or incurs contempt.</P>
<P>The arrogant mind, and the proud
hope, and equally contrary to religion, and
<PB N="254" REF="267">
to prudence. The world cannot bear &s;uch
a &s;pirit; and Providence &s;eldom fails to
check it. The Almighty beholds with di&s;|plea&s;ure
tho&s;e who, intoxicated with pro|&s;perity,
forget their dependence on that Su|preme
Power which rai&s;ed them up. His
awful government of the world has been
in nothing more con&s;picuous than in <HI>bring|ing
low the lofty looks of man, and &s;cattering
the proud in the imaginations of their minds.
&mdash;Is not this the great Babylon which I have
built by the might of my power, and for the
honour of my Maje&s;ty</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Daniel, iv. 30. 31.</NOTE>? Thus exclaimed
the pre&s;umptuous monarch, in the pride of
his heart. But, lo! when the word was
yet in his mouth, the vi&s;itation from hea|ven
came, and the voice was heard; <HI>O,
Nebuchadnezzar! to thee it is &s;poken; thy
kingdom is departed from thee.&mdash;He that ex|alteth
him&s;elf, &s;hall be humbled; and he that
humbleth him&s;elf, &s;hall be exalted</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke, xiv. 11.</NOTE>. A tem|perate
&s;pirit, and moderate expectations,
are the be&s;t &s;afeguard of the mind in this
<PB N="255" REF="268">
uncertain and changing &s;tate. They en|able
us to pa&s;s through life with mo&s;t
comfort. When we ri&s;e in the world, they
contribute to our elevation; and if we
mu&s;t fall, they render our fall the lighter.</P>
<P>IV. MODERATION in our plea&s;ures is an
important exerci&s;e of the virtue which we
are now con&s;idering. It is an invariable
law of our pre&s;ent condition, that every
plea&s;ure which is pur&s;ued to exce&s;s, con|verts
it&s;elf into poi&s;on. What was intend|ed
for the cordial and refre&s;hment of hu|man
life, through want of moderation, we
turn to its bane. In all the plea&s;ures of
&s;en&s;e, it is apparent, that only when indul|ged
within certain limits, they confer &s;a|tisfaction.
No &s;ooner do we pa&s;s the line
which temperance had drawn, than perni|cious
effects come forward, and &s;how them|&s;elves.
Could I lay open to your view the
monuements of death, they would read a
lecture in favour of moderation, much
more powerful than any that the mo&s;t elo|quent
preacher can give. You would be|hold
<PB N="256" REF="269">
hold the graves peopled with the victims
of intemperance. You would behold tho&s;e
chambers of darkne&s;s hung round, on eve|ry
&s;ide, with the trophies of luxury, drunk|enne&s;s,
and &s;en&s;uality. So numerous would
you find tho&s;e martyrs of iniquity, that it
may &s;afely be a&s;&s;erted, where war or pe&s;ti|lence
have &s;lain their thou&s;ands, intempe|rate
plea&s;ure has &s;lain its ten thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>While the want of moderation in plea|&s;ure
brings men to an untimely grave,
at the &s;ame time, until they arrive there,
it pur&s;ues and afflicts them with evils
innumerable. To what cau&s;e &s;o much
as to this, are owing, faded youth, and
premature old age; an evervated body,
and an enfeebled mind; together with
all that long train of di&s;ea&s;es, which the
indulgence of appetite and &s;en&s;e have in|troduced
into the world? Health, chear|fulne&s;s,
and vigour, are known to be the
offspring of temperance. The man of
moderation brings to all the natural and
innocent plea&s;ures of life, that &s;ound un|corrupted
reli&s;h, which gives him a much
<PB N="257" REF="270">
fuller enjoyment of them, than the palled
and vitiated appetite of the voluptuary al|lows
him to know. He culls the flower of
every allowable gratification, without dwell|ing
upon it until the flavour be lo&s;t. He
ta&s;tes the &s;weet of every plea&s;ure, without
pur&s;uing it till the bitter dregs ri&s;e. Where|as
the man of oppo&s;ite character dips &s;o
deep, that he never fails to &s;tir an impure
and noxious &s;ediment, which lies at the
bottom of the cup.&mdash;In the plea&s;ures,
be&s;ides, which are regulated by modera|tion,
there is always that dignity which
goes along with innocence. No man needs
to be a&s;hamed of them. They are con&s;i&s;t|ent
with honour; with the favour of God,
and of man. But the &s;en&s;uali&s;t, who di&s;|dains
all re&s;traint in his plea&s;ures, is odious
in the public eye. His vices become gro&s;s;
his character, contemptible; and he ends
in being a burden both to him&s;elf and to
&s;ociety. Let me exhort you, once more,</P>
<P>V. To moderation in all your pa&s;&s;ions.
This exerci&s;e of the virtue is the more re|qui&s;ite,
<PB N="258" REF="271">
becau&s;e there is no pa&s;&s;ion in hu|man
nature but what has, of it&s;elf, a ten|dency
to run into exce&s;s. For all pa&s;&s;ion
implies a violent emotion of mind. Of
cour&s;e, it is apt to derange the regular
cour&s;e of our ideas; and to produce con|fu&s;ion
within. Nothing, at the &s;ame time,
is more &s;educing than pa&s;&s;ion. During the
time when it grows and &s;wells, it con&s;tant|ly
ju&s;tifies, to our apprehen&s;ion, the tumult
which it creates, by means of a thou&s;and
fal&s;e arguments which it forms, and brings
to its aid. Of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ions, &s;uch as anger
and re&s;entment, the exce&s;s is &s;o obviou&s;ly
dangerous, as loudly to call for modera|tion.
He who gives him&s;elf up to the im|petuo&s;ity
of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions, without re&s;traint,
is univer&s;ally condemned by the world;
and hardly accounted a man of &s;ound
mind. But, what is le&s;s apt to be attend|ed
to, &s;ome even of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which
are reckoned innocent, or who&s;e tendency
to di&s;order and evil is not apparent, &s;tand,
neverthele&s;s, in need of moderation and re|&s;traint,
as well as others. For, &s;uch is the
<PB N="259" REF="272">
feeblene&s;s of our nature, that every pa&s;&s;ion
which has for its object any worldly good,
is in hazard of attaching us too &s;trongly,
and of tran&s;porting us beyond the bounds
of rea&s;on. If allowed to acquire the full and
unre&s;trained dominion of the heart, it is
&s;ufficient, in various &s;ituations, to render
us mi&s;erable; and almo&s;t in every &s;itua|tion,
by its ingro&s;&s;ing power, to render
us negligent of duties which, as men or
Chri&s;tians, we are bound to perform.</P>
<P>Of the in&s;idious growth of pa&s;&s;ion, there|fore,
we have great rea&s;on to beware. We
ought always to have at hand con&s;idera|tions,
which may a&s;&s;i&s;t us in tempering its
wramth, and in regaining po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our
&s;ouls. Let us be per&s;uaded, that moments
of pa&s;&s;ion are always moments of delu&s;ion;
that nothing truly is, what it then &s;eems to
be; that all the opinions which we then
form, are erroneous; and all the judge|ments
which we pa&s;s, are extravagant. Let
modertaion accu&s;tom us to wait until the
fumes of pa&s;&s;ion be &s;pent; until the mi&s;t
which it has rai&s;ed begin to be di&s;&s;ipated.
<PB N="260" REF="273">
We &s;hall then be able to &s;ee where truth
and right lie; and rea&s;on &s;hall, by degrees,
re&s;ume the a&s;cendant. On no occa&s;ion let
us imagine, that &s;trength of mind is &s;hown
by violence of pa&s;&s;ion. This is not the
&s;trength of men, but the impetuo&s;ity of
children. It is the &s;trength of one who is
in the delirium of a fever, or under the
di&s;ea&s;e of madne&s;s. The &s;trength of &s;uch a
per&s;on is indeed increa&s;ed. But it is an
unnatural &s;trength; which being under no
proper guidance, is directed towards ob|jects
that occa&s;ion his de&s;truction. True
&s;trength of mind is &s;hown in governing
and re&s;i&s;ting pa&s;&s;ion, not in giving it &s;cope;
in re&s;training the wild bea&s;t within; and
acting, on the mo&s;t trying occa&s;ions, ac|cording
to the dictates of con&s;cience, and
temperate rea&s;on.</P>
<P>THUS I have pointed out, in &s;everal in|&s;tances,
how moderation ought to be di&s;|played:
Moderation in our wi&s;hes; mo|deration
in our pur&s;uits; moderation in
our hopes; moderation in our plea&s;ures;
<PB N="261" REF="274">
moderation in our pa&s;&s;ions. It is a prin|ciple
which &s;hould habitually influence our
conduct and form the reigning tempera|ture
of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>THE great motive to this virtue is &s;ugge&s;t|ed
by the words immediately following the
text; <HI>the Lord is at hand.</HI> The Judge is co|ming,
who is to clo&s;e this temporary &s;cene of
things, and to introduce a higher &s;tate of
exi&s;tence. The day is at hand, which will
place the great concerns of men in a point
of view very different from that in which
they are at pre&s;ent beheld; will &s;trip the
world of its fal&s;e glory; will detect the va|nity
of earthly pur&s;uits; and di&s;clo&s;e ob|jects
which have the proper title to intere&s;t
a rational mind. Objects acquire power
to engage our pa&s;&s;ions, only in proportion
as they are conceived to be great. But
great, or little, are no more then terms of
compari&s;on. Tho&s;e things which appear
great to one who knows nothing greater,
will &s;ink into a diminutive &s;ize, when he
becomes acquainted with objects of a high|er
<PB N="262" REF="275">
nature. Were it oftener in our thoughts,
that <HI>the Lord is at hand,</HI> none of tho&s;e
things which now di&s;compo&s;e and agitate
worldly men, would appear of &s;ufficient
magnitude to rai&s;e commotion in our
brea&s;ts. Enlarged views of the future de|&s;tination
of man, and of the place which
he may hope to po&s;&s;e&s;s in an eternal
world, naturally give birth to modera|tion
of mind. They tend to cool all mi&s;|placed
ardour about the advantages of this
&s;tate; and to produce that calm and tem|perate
frame of &s;pirit, which becomes men
and Chri&s;tians. They give no ground for
entire di&s;regard of earthly concerns. While
we are men, we mu&s;t feel and act as &s;uch.
But they afford a good rea&s;on why they
who believe <HI>the Lord to be at hand,</HI> &s;hould
let their <HI>moderation</HI> appear, and <HI>be known
unto all men.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is well known,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIII.</NOTE> that men have always
been much inclined to place their hap|pine&s;s
in the advantages of fortune, and
the di&s;tinctions of rank. Hence the&s;e have
been pur&s;ued by the multitude with &s;uch
avidity, that every principle of honour,
probity, and virtue, have been &s;acrificed
to the attainment of them. At the &s;ame
time, many circum&s;tances might have con|vinced
men, that &s;uppo&s;ing them to &s;uc|ce&s;sful
<PB N="264" REF="277">
in the pur&s;uit, it by no means fol|lowed,
that happine&s;s was to be the re|ward.
For if happine&s;s be, in truth, e&s;|&s;entially
connected with &s;plendid fortune,
or exalted rank, how comes it to pa&s;s that
many in the inferior &s;tations of life, vi&s;ibly
&s;pend their days with more comfort than
they who occupy the higher departments
of the world? Why does the beggar &s;ing,
while the King is &s;ad? A &s;mall mea&s;ure of
reflection on our nature might &s;atisfy us,
that there are other principles of happine&s;s
or mi&s;ery, too often overlooked by the
world, which immediately affect the heart,
and operate there with greater force and
power, than any circum&s;tances of rank or
fortune. This is the ob&s;ervation of the
wi&s;e man in the text; and what I now pur|po&s;e
to illu&s;trate. I &s;hall take a view of
the chief &s;ources of that <HI>bitterne&s;s which the
heart knoweth,</HI> and of that <HI>joy with which
a &s;tranger doth not intermeddle;</HI> and then
&s;hall point out the proper improvements to
be made of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="278">
IF we inquire carefully into the &s;ources
of the joy or bitterne&s;s of the heart, we
&s;hall find, that they are chiefly two; that
they ari&s;e either from a man's own mind
and temper; or, from the connection in
which he &s;tands with &s;ome of his fellow|creatures.
In other words, the circum|&s;tances
which mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially affect every
man's happine&s;s are, his per&s;onal character,
and his &s;ocial feelings.</P>
<P>I. EVERY man's own mind and temper
is, nece&s;&s;arily, to him&s;elf a &s;ource of much
inward joy or bitterne&s;s. For every man,
if we may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, is
more connected with him&s;elf, than with
any external object. He is con&s;tantly a
companion to him&s;elf in his own thoughts;
and what he meets with there, mu&s;t of all
things, contribute mo&s;t to his happine&s;s or
his di&s;quiet. Whatever his condition in
the world be, whether high or low, if he
find to cau&s;e to upbraid him&s;elf for his
behaviour; if he be &s;atisfied that his con|duct
proceeds upon a rational plan; if,
<PB N="266" REF="279">
amid&s;t the failings incident to humanity,
his con&s;cience be, in the main, free from
reproach, and his mind undi&s;turbed by
any di&s;mal pre&s;ages of futurity; the foun|dation
is laid for a placid and agreeable te|nor
of life. If to this you add a calm and
chearful temper, not ea&s;ily fretted or di|&s;turbed,
not &s;ubject to envy, nor prone to
violent pa&s;&s;ion, much of that joy will be
produced, which it is &s;aid in the text, <HI>a
&s;tranger intermeddleth not with.</HI> For this is
an intrin&s;ic joy, independent of all foreign
cau&s;es. <HI>The upright man,</HI> as it is written,
<HI>is &s;atisfied from him&s;elf.</HI> Undi&s;turbed by
the vexations of folly, or the remor&s;e of
guilt, his nights will be peaceful, and his
days &s;erene. His mind is a kingdom to it|&s;elf.
A good con&s;cience, and good tem|per,
prepare, even in the mid&s;t of poverty,
<HI>a continual fea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>But how &s;adly will the &s;cene be rever&s;ed,
if the fir&s;t thoughts which occur to a man
concerning him&s;elf, &s;hall be of a gloomy
and threatening kind; if his temper, in|&s;tead
of calmne&s;s and &s;elf-enjoyment, &s;hall
<PB N="267" REF="280">
yield him nothing but di&s;quiet and painful
agitation? In any &s;ituation of fortune, is
it po&s;&s;ible for him to be happy, who&s;e
mind is in this troubled &s;tate? <HI>The &s;pirit
of a man will &s;u&s;tain his infirmities; but a
wounded &s;pirit, who can bear?</HI> Vigour of
mind, may enable a man to &s;u&s;tain many
&s;hocks of adver&s;ity. In his &s;pirit, as long
as it is &s;ound, he can find a re&s;ource,
when other auxiliaries fail. But if that
which &s;hould &s;u&s;tain him be enfeebled and
broken; if that to which he has recour&s;e
for the cure of other &s;orrows, become it&s;elf
the wounded part; to what quarter can he
turn for relief?</P>
<P>The wounds which the &s;pirit &s;uffers are
owing chiefly to three cau&s;es; to folly, to
pa&s;&s;ion, or to guilt. They frequently ori|ginate
from folly; that is, from vain, and
improper pur&s;uits, which, though not di|rectly
criminal, are un&s;uitable to a man's
age, character, or condition, in the world.
In con&s;equence of the&s;e, he beholds him|&s;elf
degraded and expo&s;ed; and &s;uffers the
pain of many a mortifying reflection, and
<PB N="268" REF="281">
many a humbling compari&s;on of him&s;elf
with others. The di&s;tre&s;s occa&s;ioned by a
&s;en&s;e of folly, is aggravated by any violent
pa&s;&s;ion being allowed to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the heart. Even though it be of the cla&s;s
of tho&s;e which are reckoned innocent, yet,
if it have entirely &s;eized and overpowered
a man, it de&s;troys his tranquillity, and
brings his mind into a perturbed &s;tate.
But if it be a pa&s;&s;ion of the black and vi|cious
kind, it is &s;ufficient to bla&s;t the mo&s;t
flouri&s;hing condition, and to poi&s;on all his
joys. If to tho&s;e wounds inflicted by fol|ly,
or by pa&s;&s;ion, you add the wound of
guilt, the remor&s;e and fear produced by
criminal deeds, you fill up the mea&s;ure of
pain, and bitterne&s;s of heart. Often have
the terrors of con&s;cience occa&s;ioned inward
paroxy&s;ms, or violent agitations of mind.
A dark and threatening cloud &s;eems, to the
con&s;cious &s;inner, to be hanging over his
head. He who believes him&s;elf de&s;pi&s;ed,
or hated, by men, and who dreads, at the
&s;ame time, an avenging God, can derive
little plea&s;ure from the external comforts of
<PB N="269" REF="282">
life. The bitterne&s;s of his hearts infu&s;es it|&s;elf
into every draught which plea&s;ure of|fers
to his lips.</P>
<P>The external misfortunes of life, di&s;ap|pointments,
poverty, and &s;ickne&s;s, are no|thing
in compari&s;on of tho&s;e inward di|&s;tre&s;&s;es
of mind, occa&s;ioned by folly, by
pa&s;&s;ion, and by guilt. They may indeed
prevail in different degrees, according as
one or other of tho&s;e principles of bitter|ne&s;s
is predominant. But they are &s;eldom
parted far a&s;under from one another; and
when, as it too often happens, all the three
are complicated, they complete the mi&s;ery
of man. The di&s;orders of the mind, ha|ving
then ari&s;en to their height, become of
all things the mo&s;t dreadful. The &s;hame
of folly, the violence of pa&s;&s;ion, and the
remor&s;e of guilt, acting in conjuction,
have too frequently driven men to the la&s;t
and abhorred refuge, of &s;eeking relief in
death from a life too embittered to be any
longer endured. I proceed to con&s;ider</P>
<P>II. OTHER troubles, and other joys of
<PB N="270" REF="283">
the heart, ari&s;ing from &s;ources different
from tho&s;e that I have now de&s;cribed;
founded in the relations or connections
which we have with others and &s;pringing
from the feelings which the&s;e occa&s;ion.
Such cau&s;es of &s;orrow or joy are of an
external nature. Religion does not teach,
that all the &s;ources of inward plea&s;ure or
pain are derived from our temper, and mo|ral
behaviour. The&s;e are indeed the prin|cipal
&s;prings of bitterne&s;s or joy. In one
way or other, they affect all the plea&s;ures
and pains of life; but they include not,
within them&s;elves, the whole of them. Our
Creator did not intend, that the happine&s;s
of each individual &s;hould have no depend|ence
on tho&s;e who are around him. Ha|ving
connected us in &s;ociety by many ties,
it is his decree, that the&s;e ties &s;hould prove,
both during their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and in their
di&s;&s;olution, cau&s;es of plea&s;ure or pain, im|mediately,
and often deeply, affecting the
human heart My doctrine, therefore, is
not, that <HI>the bitterne&s;s which the heart know|eth
as its own,</HI> and <HI>the joy with which a
<PB N="271" REF="284">
&s;tranger intermeddleth not,</HI> is independent of
every thing external. What I a&s;&s;ert is,
that this <HI>bitterne&s;s,</HI> and this <HI>joy,</HI> depend
much more on other cau&s;es, than on riches
or poverty, on high or low &s;tations in the
world; that, equally in the conditions of
elevated fortune, and of private life, the
mo&s;t material circum&s;tances of trouble or
felicity, next to the &s;tate of our own mind
and temper, are the &s;en&s;ations and affec|tions
which ari&s;e from the connections we
have with others.</P>
<P>IN order to make this appear, let us &s;up|po&s;e
a man, in any rank or condition of
life, happy in his family and his friends;
&s;oothed by the cordial intercour&s;e of kind
affections, which he partakes with them;
enjoying the comfort of doing them good
offices, and receiving in return their &s;ince|re&s;t
gratitude; experiencing no jealou&s;y
nor envy, no di&s;quiet or alienation of af|fection,
among tho&s;e with whom he is con|nected;
&mdash;how many, and how copious
&s;ources of inward joy open to &s;uch a man!
<PB N="272" REF="285">
How &s;mooth is the tenor of a life that pro|ceeds
in &s;uch a cour&s;e! What a &s;miling
a&s;pect does the love of parents and chil|dren,
of brothers and &s;i&s;ters, of friends and
relations, give to every &s;urrounding object,
and every returning day! With what a
lu&s;tre does it gild even the &s;mall habitation
where &s;uch placid intercour&s;e dwells; where
&s;uch &s;cenes of heartfelt &s;atisfaction &s;ucceed
uninterruptedly to one another!</P>
<P>But let us &s;uppo&s;e this joyful intercour&s;e
to be broken off, in an untimely hour, by
the cruel hand of the la&s;t foe; let us ima|gine
the family, once &s;o happy among
them&s;elves, to behold the parent, the child,
or the &s;pou&s;e, to whom their hearts were
attached by the tendere&s;t ties, &s;tretched on
the cold bed of death; then, what bitter|ne&s;s
does the heart know! This, in the
&s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, is its <HI>own bitterne&s;s;</HI> from
which it is not in the power of any exter|nal
circum&s;tance whatever to afford it re|lief.
Aid&s;t tho&s;e piercing griefs of the
heart, all ranks of life are levelled; all di&s;|tinctions
of fortune are forgotten. Un|availing
<PB N="273" REF="286">
availing are the trophies of &s;plendid woe,
with which riches deck the fatal couch, to
give the lea&s;t comfort to the mourner. The
prince, and the pea&s;ant, then equally feel
their own bitterne&s;s. Dwelling on the me|lancholy
remebrance of joys that are pa&s;t
and gone, the one forgets this poverty; the
other de&s;pi&s;es the gilded trappings of his
&s;tate. Both, in that &s;ad hour, are fully
&s;en&s;ible, that on the favours of fortune it
depends not to make man happy in this
world.</P>
<P>But it is not only the death of friends,
which, in the mid&s;t of a &s;eemingly pro|&s;perous
&s;tate, is able to bring di&s;tre&s;s home
to the heart. From various failures in their
conduct when living, ari&s;es much of the
inward unea&s;ine&s;s we &s;uffer. It will, in
general, be found, that the behaviour of
tho&s;e among whom we live in near connec|tion,
is, next to per&s;onal character and
temper, the chief &s;ource, either of the plea|&s;ures,
or of the di&s;quietudes, of every man's
life. As, when their behaviour is cordial
and &s;atisfactory, it is of all external things
<PB N="274" REF="287">
the mo&s;t &s;oothing to the mind; &s;o, on the
other hand, their levity, their inattention,
or occa&s;ional har&s;hne&s;s, even though it pro|ceed
to no decided breach of friend&s;hip,
yet ruffles and frets the temper. Social
life, hara&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e petty vexations,
re&s;embles a road which a man is doomed
daily to travel; but finds it rugged, and
&s;tony, and painful to be trod.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e becomes much wor&s;e, if the
ba&s;e and criminal conduct of per&s;ons whom
we have once loved, di&s;&s;olve all the bonds
of amity, and &s;how that our confidence
has been abu&s;ed. Then are opened, &s;ome
of the deepe&s;t &s;prings of bitterne&s;s in the
human heart.&mdash;Behold the heart of the
parent, torn by the unworthy behaviour,
and cruel ingratitude of the child whom
he had trained up with the fonde&s;t hopes;
on whom he had lavi&s;hed his whole affec|tion;
and for who&s;e &s;ake he had laboured
and toiled, through the cour&s;e of a long life.
Behold the endearments of the conjugal
&s;tate changed into black &s;u&s;picion, and mi&s;|tru&s;t;
the affectionate &s;pou&s;e, or the vir|tuous
<PB N="275" REF="288">
hu&s;band, left to mourn, with a bro|ken
heart, the infidelity of the once-beloved
partner of their life. Behold the un&s;u&s;|pecting
friend betrayed, in the hour of
danger, by the friend in whom he tru&s;ted;
or, in the mid&s;t of &s;evere misfortune, meet|ing
nothing but cold indifference, perhaps
&s;corn and contempt, where he had expect|ed
to find the kinde&s;t &s;ympathy.&mdash;Are
the&s;e, let me a&s;k, uncommon &s;cenes in the
world? Are &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;es peculiar to any
rank or &s;tation? Do they chiefly befall
per&s;ons in humble life, and have the great
any prerogative which affords them exemp|tion?
When the heart is &s;orely wounded
by the ingratitude or faithle&s;&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e
on who it had leaned with the whole
weight of affection, where &s;hall it turn for
relief? Will it find comfort in the recol|lection
of honours and titles, or in the con|templation
of &s;urrounding trea&s;ures?&mdash;
Talk not of the honours of a court. Talk
not of the wealth of the ea&s;t. The&s;e, in
the hours of heart-bitterne&s;s are &s;purned,
as contemptible and vile; perhaps cur&s;ed,
<PB N="276" REF="289">
as indirect cau&s;es of the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s.
The dart has made its way to the heart.
There, there, it is fixed. The very &s;eat of
feeling is a&s;&s;ailed; and in proportion to
the &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;ufferer's heart, and
the tenderne&s;s of his affections, &s;uch, un|fortunately,
will be his degree of angui&s;h.
A good con&s;cience, and hope in God, may
indeed bring him con&s;olation. But un|der
&s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the heart, as I have
de&s;cribed, fortune, be it as flouri&s;hing as
you will, is no more than an empty pa|geant.
It is a feeble reed, which affords
no &s;upport. It is a hou&s;e of &s;traw, which
is &s;cattered before the wind.</P>
<P>THUS you &s;ee his doctrine meeting us
from many quarters, that the heart knows
a bitterne&s;s and a joy of its own, altogether
di&s;tinct from the unea&s;ine&s;s or the plea&s;ure
that is produced by the circum&s;tances of
external fortune; ari&s;ing either from per|&s;onal
character, and the &s;tate of a man's
own mind; or from the affections excited
by the relations in which he &s;tands to others.
<PB N="277" REF="290">
This joy, and this bitterne&s;s, are, each of
them, of &s;o much greater con&s;equence than
any di&s;tinctions of fortune, that ble&s;&s;ed with
the former, one may be happy, as far as
human happine&s;s goes, in a cottage; and
afflicted with the latter, he mu&s;t be mi&s;e|rable
in a palace.&mdash;Let us now proceed
to an important part of the &s;ubject, the
practical improvement to which this doc|trine
leads.</P>
<P>FIRST, Let is &s;erve to moderate our pa&s;|&s;ion
for riches, and high &s;ituations in the
world. It is well known, that the eager
pur&s;uit of the&s;e is the chief incentive to the
crimes that fill the world. Hence, among
the middle and lower ranks of men, all the
fraud, fal&s;ehood, and treachery, with which
the competition for gain infe&s;ts &s;ociety.
Hence, in the higher &s;tations of the world,
all the atrocious crimes flowing from am|bition,
and the love of power, by which
the peace of mankind has &s;o often been
broken, and the earth &s;tained with blood.
Had the&s;e coveted advantages the power,
<PB N="278" REF="291">
when obtained, of en&s;uring joy to the
heart, and rendering it a &s;tranger to bitter|ne&s;s,
&s;ome apology might be offered for
the violence to which they have given oc|ca&s;ion.
The prize might be &s;uppo&s;ed wor|thy
of being acquired at a high expence,
when &s;o much depended on the attain|ment.
But I have &s;hown, I hope with &s;a|tisfactory
evidence, that the contrary is the
truth. I &s;ay not, that the advantages of
fortune de&s;erve no regard from a wi&s;e or a
good man. Poverty is always di&s;tre&s;&s;ing.
Opulence and rank are both attended with
many comforts, and may be rendered &s;ub|&s;ervient
to the mo&s;t valuable purpo&s;es. But
what I &s;ay is, that it is a great error to rate
them beyond their ju&s;t value. Secondary
advantages, inferior a&s;&s;i&s;tances to felicity,
they are; and no more. They rank below
every thing that immediately affects the
heart; and that is a native &s;ource of joy or
bitterne&s;s there. If a man be either un|happy
in his di&s;po&s;itions, or unhappy in all
his connections, you heap upon him in
vain, all the trea&s;ures, and all the honours,
<PB N="279" REF="292">
which kings can be&s;tow. Dive&s;t the&s;e
things, then, of that fal&s;e glare which the
opinions of the multitude throw around
them. Contemplate them with a more im|partial
eye. Pur&s;ue them with le&s;s eager|ne&s;s.
Above all, never &s;acrifice to the pur|&s;uit
any degree of probity or moral worth
of candour or good affection; if you would
not lay a foundation for that bitterne&s;s of
heart, which none of the goods of fortune
can either compen&s;ate or cure.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, Let the ob&s;ervations which
have been made, correct our mi&s;takes, and
check our complaints, concerning a &s;uppo|&s;ed
promi&s;cuous di&s;tribution of happine&s;s
in this world. The charge of inju&s;tice,
which &s;o often, on this account, hath been
brought again&s;t Providence, re&s;ts entirely
on this ground, that the happine&s;s and mi|&s;ery
of men may be e&s;timated by the de|gree
of their external pro&s;perity. This is
the delu&s;ion under which the multitude
have always laboured; but which a ju&s;t
con&s;ideration of the invi&s;ible &s;prings of hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="280" REF="293">
that affect the heart, is &s;ufficient to
correct. If you would judge whether a
man be really happy, it is not &s;olely to his
hou&s;es and his lands, to his equipage and
his retinue, you are to look. Unle&s;s you
could &s;ee farther, and di&s;cern what joy, or
what bitterne&s;s, his heart feels, you can
pronounce nothing concerning him. That
proud and wicked man, whom you behold
&s;urrounded with &s;tate and &s;plendour, and
upon whom you think the favours of Hea|ven
&s;o improperly lavi&s;hed, may be a
wretch, pining away in &s;ecret, with a thou|&s;and
griefs unknown to the world. That
poor man, who appears neglected and over|looked,
may, in his humble &s;tation, be
partaking of all the moral, and all the &s;o|cial
joys, that exhilarate the heart; may
be living chearful, contented, and happy.
Cea&s;e, then, to murmur again&s;t di&s;pen&s;a|tions
of Providence, which are, to us, &s;o im|perfectly
known. Envy not the pro&s;perity
of &s;inners. Judge not of the real condition
of men, from what floats merely on the
&s;urface of their &s;tate. Let us rather,</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="294">
THIRDLY, Turn our attention to tho&s;e
internal &s;ources of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, on
which it hath been &s;hown that &s;o much
depends. As far as the bitterne&s;s or joy
of the heart ari&s;es from the fir&s;t of tho&s;e
great &s;prings which I a&s;&s;igned to it, our
own conduct and temper, &s;o far our hap|pine&s;s
is placed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure in our
own hands. What is ami&s;s or di&s;ordered
within, in con&s;equence of folly, of pa&s;&s;ion,
or guilt, may be rectified by due care, un|der
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of divine grace. He who
thereby attains to a tranquil and compo&s;ed
&s;tate of heart, free from ill humour and
di&s;gu&s;t, from violent pa&s;&s;ions, and from
vexing remor&s;e, is laying a foundation for
enjoyment of him&s;elf, much &s;urer and
broader, than if he were ama&s;&s;ing thou|&s;ands
to increa&s;e his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>With regard to the other &s;pring of joy
or bitterne&s;s of heart, ari&s;ing from our con|nections
with others, here indeed, we are
more dependent on things not within our
power. The&s;e connections are not al|ways
of our own forming; and even when
<PB N="282" REF="295">
they have been formed by choice, the wi&s;e&s;t
are liable to be di&s;appointed in their expec|tations.
Yet here too it will be found, that
the proper regulation of the heart is of the
utmo&s;t importance, both for improving the
joys which our &s;ituation affords, and for
mitigating the griefs which our connec|tions
may render unavoidable. As far as
the choice of friends or relatives depends
on our&s;elves, let their virtue and worth
ever direct that choice, if we look for
any la&s;ting felicity from it. In all the
habits and attachments of &s;ocial life, after
they are formed, let it be our &s;tudy, to ful|fil
properly our own part. Let nothing be
wanting on our &s;ide, to nouri&s;h that mutual
harmony and affectionate friend&s;hip which,
in every &s;ituation of life, as has been &s;hown,
is of &s;o great con&s;equence to our peace and
&s;atisfaction. It is not, indeed, in our power
to pre&s;erve always alive tho&s;e friends, in
whom our hearts delight. It is often not
in our power to prevent the ingratitude and
unworthy behaviour of other friends, from
whom we once expected comfort. But
<PB N="283" REF="296">
under tho&s;e afflicting incidents of life,
much may be done by proper employment
of the thoughts, and direction of the affec|tions,
for obtaining relief. To a purified
and well-regulated heart, rea&s;on and reli|gion
can bring many aids for healing its
wounds, and re&s;toring its peace; aids which,
to the negligent and vicious, are wholly
unknown. The greater experience we have
of the vici&s;&s;itudes of human life, with more
weight will that precept of the wi&s;e man
always come home to our remembrance;
<HI>Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of
it are the i&s;&s;ues of life</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prov. iv. 23.</NOTE>&mdash;Hence, ari&s;es,</P>
<P>IN the fourth and la&s;t place, another in|&s;truction,
that it is of the utmo&s;t import|ance
to us all, frequently to look up to
Him who made the human heart; and to
implore his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the regulation and
government of it. Known to him, are all
the &s;ources of bitterne&s;s and joy by which
it is affected. On him it depends, to let
<PB N="284" REF="297">
them forth, or to &s;hut them up; to in|crea&s;e,
or to dimini&s;h them, at his plea|&s;ure.
In a &s;tudy &s;o infinitely important to
happine&s;s, as that of the pre&s;ervation of in|ward
peace, we cannot be too earne&s;t in
be&s;eeching aid from the great Father of
Spirits, to enable us to keep our hearts free
from di&s;tre&s;s and trouble.&mdash;Be&s;ides the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance which we may hope to derive
from divine grace, the employments of de|votion
them&s;elves, form one of the mo&s;t
powerful means of compo&s;ing, and tran|quilli&s;ing
the heart. One various occa&s;ions,
when the &s;ources of heart-bitterne&s;s have
been mo&s;t overflowing, devotion has been
found the only refuge of the &s;ufferer. De|votion
opens a &s;anctuary, to which they,
who&s;e hearts have been mo&s;t deeply wound|ed,
can always fly. Within that quiet and
&s;acred retreat, they have often found a
healing bal&s;am prepared. When grieved
by men, they have derived, from the a&s;cent
of the mind towards God and cele&s;tial ob|jects,
much to &s;ooth them at pre&s;ent, and
much to hope for in future. Let us, there|fore,
<PB N="285" REF="298">
neglect no mean with which religion
can furni&s;h us, for promoting the joys, and
a&s;&s;uaging the bitterne&s;s of the heart. A|mid&s;t
the frailties of our nature, the incon|&s;tancy
of men, and the frequent changes
of human life, we &s;hall find every a&s;&s;i&s;tance
that can be procured, little enough, for en|abling
us to pa&s;s our few days with tole|rable
comfort and peace.</P>

In &s;ome, either the good or the bad qualities

the character; to di&s;criminate one per&s;on
as a virtuous, another as a vicious man.
In others, the&s;e qualities are &s;o mixed to|gether,
as to leave the character doubtful.
The light and the &s;hade are &s;o much blend|ed,
the colours of virtue and vice run in
&s;uch a manner into one another, that we
<PB N="287" REF="300">
can hardly di&s;tingui&s;h where the one ends,
and the other begins; and we remain in
&s;u&s;pence, whether to blame or to prai&s;e.
While we admire tho&s;e who are thorough|ly

is proper al&s;o to be&s;tow attention on tho&s;e
imperfect characters, where there may be

and where regard to the commendable part,

is defective or faulty. Such attentions will
be found the more u&s;eful, as characters of
this mixed &s;ort are, more frequently than
any other, exhibited to us in the commerce
of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>It was one of this &s;ort, which gave occa|&s;ion
to the incident recorded in the text. The
incident &s;eems to have been con&s;idered as re|markable,
&s;ince it is recounted by three of
the evangelical writers; and by them all,
with nearly the &s;ame circum&s;tances. The
per&s;on to whom the hi&s;tory relates was <HI>a ru|ler;</HI>
one of higher rank and &s;tation than
tho&s;e who u&s;ually re&s;orted to Je&s;us. He
was <HI>a rich man:</HI> He was <HI>a young man.</HI> His
<PB N="288" REF="301">
whole behaviour was prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and en|gaging.
He appears to have conceived a
high opinion of our Lord. He addre&s;&s;ed
him with the utmo&s;t re&s;pect; and the que|&s;tion
which he put to him was proper and im|portant.
<HI>He kneeled to him; and &s;aid, Good
Ma&s;ter, What &s;hall I do that I may inherit
eternal life?</HI> His conduct in the world had
been regular and decent. He could pro|te&s;t,
that he had hitherto kept him&s;elf free
from any gro&s;s vice; and in his dealings
with others, had ob&s;erved the precepts of
God. Our Lord, <HI>beholding him,</HI> is &s;aid to
have <HI>loved him;</HI> whence we have rea&s;on to
conclude, that he was not hypocritical in
his profe&s;&s;ions; and that his countenance
carried the expre&s;&s;ion of good di&s;po&s;itions,
as his &s;peech, and his manners, were altoge|ther
complacent and gentle. Yet this per|&s;on,
amiable as he was, when his virtue
was put to the te&s;t, di&s;appointed the hopes
which he had given rea&s;on to form. At|tached,
in all probability, to the indulgence
of ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, he wanted fortitude
of mind to part with the advantages of the
<PB N="289" REF="302">
world, for the &s;ake of religion. When our
Lord required him to fulfil his good inten|tions,
by relinqui&s;hing his fortune, beco|ming
one of his followers, and preparing
him&s;elf to encounter &s;ufferings, the &s;acri|fice
appeared to him too great. Impre&s;&s;ions
of virtue, however, &s;till remained on his
mind. He was &s;en&s;ible of what he ought
to have done; and regretted his want of
courage to do it. He <HI>was &s;orrowful:</HI> He
<HI>was grieved:</HI> Yet <HI>be went away.</HI></P>
<P>PERSONS of a character &s;omewhat re|&s;embling
this, all of us may have met with;
e&s;pecially, among the young; among tho&s;e
who have been liberally educated, and
poli&s;hed by good &s;ociety. That abhor
open vice, and crimes that di&s;turb the
world. They have a re&s;pect for religion.
They are willing to receive in&s;truction for
their conduct. They are mode&s;t and un|a&s;&s;uming;
re&s;pectful to their &s;uperiors in
age or &s;tation; gentle in their addre&s;s; in|offen&s;ive
and courteous in their whole be|haviour.
They are fond of obliging every
<PB N="290" REF="303">
one; unwilling to hurt or di&s;plea&s;e any.&mdash;
Such per&s;ons we cannot but love. We
gladly promi&s;e well of them; and are di&s;|po&s;ed
to forward and a&s;&s;i&s;t them. Yet &s;uch
is the weakne&s;s of our nature, that at the
bottom of this character there may lie, as
we &s;ee exemplified in the in&s;tance before
us, &s;ome &s;ecret and material defects. That
vigour of mind, that firmne&s;s of principle,
may be wanting, which is requi&s;ite for en|abling
them to act with propriety, when
their virtue is put to a deci&s;ive trial. The
&s;oftne&s;s of their nature is unfavourable to a
&s;teady per&s;everance in the cour&s;e of inte|grity.
They po&s;&s;e&s;s the amiable qualities;
but there is ground to &s;u&s;pect, that in the
e&s;timable ones they are deficient. While,
therefore, we by no means cla&s;s them among
the bad, we dare not give them the full
prai&s;e of virtue. When they &s;et out in the
world, we cannot pronounce with confi|dence,
what confirmed features their cha|racter
will a&s;&s;ume; nor how far they can
be depended upon, in future life. Allow
me now to point out the dangers which
<PB N="291" REF="304">
&s;uch per&s;ons are mo&s;t likely to incur; and
to &s;how what is requi&s;ite for them farther
to &s;tudy, in order to their fulfilling the part
of good men and true Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>I. PERSONS of this de&s;cription are not
qualified for di&s;charging aright many du|ties,
to which their &s;ituation in life may
call them. In certain circum&s;tances, they
behave with abundance of propriety. When
all is calm and &s;mooth around them; when
nothing occurs to agitate the mind, or to
di&s;turb the tenor of placid life, none of
their defects come forward. They are be|loved;
and they are u&s;eful. They promote
the comfort of human &s;ociety; and, by
gentlene&s;s, and courte&s;y of manners, &s;erve
to cement men together in agreeable union.
But to &s;ail on the tranquil &s;urface of an
unru&s;&s;led lake, and to &s;teer a &s;afe cour&s;e
through a troubled and &s;tormy ocean, re|quire
different talents: and alas! human
life oftener re&s;embles the &s;tormy ocean,
than the unruffled lake. We &s;hall not
have been long embarked, without find|ing
<PB N="292" REF="305">
the re&s;emblance to hold too clo&s;e|ly.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the bu&s;tle of the world, amid&s;t
the open contentions, and &s;ecret enmities,
which prevail in every &s;ociety, mildne&s;s
and gentlene&s;s alone, are not &s;ufficient to
carry us, with honour, through the duties
of our different &s;tations; as heads of fami|lies,
citizens, &s;ubjects, magi&s;trates, or as
engaged in the pur&s;uits of our &s;everal call|ings.
Di&s;turbances and trials ari&s;e, which
demand vigorous exertions of all the moral
powers; of patience, vigilance, and &s;elf|denial;
of con&s;tancy and fortitude, to &s;up|port
us under danger and reproach; of
temperance, to re&s;train us from being car|ried
away by plea&s;ure; of firm and deter|mined
principle, to make us de&s;pi&s;e the
brides of &s;in. The&s;e many di&s;po&s;itions of
mind are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to prepare
one, for &s;urmounting the di&s;couragements
of virtue; and for &s;truggling honourably
through the hard&s;hips of life. Unle&s;s he
be thus armed and fortified, whatever good
intentions have been in his heart, they are
<PB N="293" REF="306">
likely to be fru&s;trated in action. Nothing
that is great, can be undertaken. Nothing
that is difficult or hazardous, can be accom|pli&s;hed.
Nor are we to imagine, that it is
only in times of per&s;ecution, or war, or ci|vil
commotions, that there is occa&s;ion for
tho&s;e &s;tronger, efforts, tho&s;e ma&s;culine vir|tues
of the &s;oul, to be di&s;played. The pri|vate,
and &s;eemingly quiet, &s;tations of life,
often call men forth, in the days of peace,
to &s;evere trials of firmne&s;s and con&s;tancy.
The life of very few proceeds in &s;o uniform
a train, as not to oblige them to di&s;cover,
in &s;ome &s;ituation or other, what portion
they po&s;&s;e&s;s of the e&s;timable qualities of
man. Hence it &s;ometimes happens, that
per&s;ons, who&s;e manners were much le&s;s
promi&s;ing and engaging than tho&s;e of
others, have, neverthele&s;s, when brought
to act a part in critical circum&s;tances, per|formed
that part with more un&s;ullied ho|nour,
and firmer integrity, than they.</P>
<P>II. PERSONS of the character I have de|&s;cribed
are ill fitted, not only for di&s;char|ging
the higher duties of life, but al&s;o for
<PB N="294" REF="307">
re&s;i&s;ting the common temptations to vice.
With good di&s;po&s;itions in their mind, with
a de&s;ire, like the young ruler in the text,
to know what they &s;hall do, in order <HI>to in|herit
eternal life;</HI> yet, when the terms re|quired
of them interfere with any favou|rite
enjoyment, like him, they are <HI>&s;orrow|ful;
and go away.</HI> The particular trial to
which he was put, may appear to be a hard
one, and to exceed the ordinary rate of
virtue. Our Lord, who di&s;cerned his heart,
&s;aw it to be nece&s;&s;ary, in his ca&s;e, for
bringing his character to the te&s;t. But in
ca&s;es, where trials of much le&s;s difficulty
pre&s;ent them&s;elves, they who partake of a
character &s;imilar to his, are often found to
give way. The good qualities which they
po&s;&s;e&s;s, border on certain weakne&s;&s;es of the
mind; and the&s;e weakne&s;&s;es are apt to be|tray
them in&s;en&s;ibly into vices, with which
they are connected.</P>
<P>Good nature, for in&s;tance, is in dan|ger
of running into that unlimited com|plai&s;ance,
which a&s;&s;imilates men to the
loo&s;e manners of tho&s;e whom they find
around them. Pliant, and yielding in
<PB N="295" REF="308">
their temper, they have not force to &s;tand
by the deci&s;ions of their own minds, with
regard to right and wrong. Like the a|nimal
which is &s;aid to a&s;&s;ume the colour
of every object to which it is applied, they
lo&s;e all proper character of their own; and
are formed by the characters of tho&s;e with
whom they chance to a&s;&s;ociate.&mdash;The mild
are apt to &s;ink into habits of indolence and
&s;loth. The chearful and gay, when warm|ed
by plea&s;ure and mirth, lo&s;e that &s;obriety
and &s;elf-denial, which is e&s;&s;entail to the
&s;upport of virtue.&mdash;Even mode&s;ty and
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, qualities &s;o valuable in them|&s;elves,
and &s;o highly ornamental to youth,
&s;ometimes degenerate into a vicious timi|dity;
a timidity which re&s;trains men from
doing their duty with firmne&s;s; which can|not
&s;tand the frown of the great, the re|proach
of the multitude, or even the ridi|cule
and &s;neer of the &s;corner.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more amiable than a
con&s;tant de&s;ire to plea&s;e; and an unwilling|ne&s;s
to offend or hurt. Yet in characters
where this is a predominant feature, de|fects
<PB N="296" REF="309">
are often found. Fond always to ob|lige,
and afraid to utter any di&s;agreeable
truth, &s;uch per&s;ons are &s;ometimes led to
di&s;&s;emble. Their love of truth is &s;acrificed
to their love of plea&s;ing. Their &s;peech, and
their manners, a&s;&s;ume a &s;tudied courte&s;y.
You cannot always depend on their &s;mile;
nor, when they promi&s;e, be &s;ure of the per|formance.
They mean and intend well.
But the good intention is temporary. Like
wax, they yield ea&s;ily to every impre&s;&s;ion;
and tran&s;ient friend&s;hip contracted with
one per&s;on, is effaced by the next. Undi&s;|tingui&s;hing
de&s;ire to oblige, often proves, in
the pre&s;ent &s;tate of human things, a dan|gerous
habit. They who cannot, on many
occa&s;ions, give a firm and &s;teady denial, or
who cannot break off a connection, which
has been ha&s;tily and improperly formed,
&s;tand on the brink of many mi&s;chiefs.
They will be &s;educed by the corrupting,
en&s;uared by the artful, betrayed by tho&s;e
in whom they had placed their tru&s;t. Un|&s;u&s;picious
them&s;elves, they were flattered
with the belief of having many friends a|round
<PB N="297" REF="310">
them. Elated with &s;anguine hopes,
and cheerful &s;pirits, they reckoned, that <HI>to|morrow
would be as this day, and more abun|dant.</HI>
Injudicious liberality, and thought|le&s;s
profu&s;ion, are the con&s;equence; until,
in the end, the &s;traits to which they are re|duced,
bring them into mean or di&s;honour|able
cour&s;es. Through innocent, but un|guarded
weakne&s;s, and from want of the
&s;everer virtues, they are, in proce&s;s of time,
betrayed into downright crimes. Such may
be the conclu&s;ion of tho&s;e, who, like the
young ruler before us, with many amiable
and promi&s;ing di&s;po&s;itions, had begun their
career in life.</P>
<P>III. SUCH per&s;ons are not prepared for
&s;u&s;taining, with propriety and dignity, the
di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which our &s;tate is liable. They
were equipped for the &s;ea&s;on of &s;un&s;hine
and &s;erenity; but when the &s;ky is overca&s;t,
and the days of darkne&s;s come, their feeble
minds are de&s;titue of &s;helter, and ill pro|vided
for defence. Then is the time, when
more hardy qualities are required; when
<PB N="298" REF="311">
courage mu&s;t face danger, con&s;tancy &s;up|port
pain, patience po&s;&s;e&s;s it&s;elf in the mid&s;t
of di&s;couragements, magnanimity di&s;play
its contempt of threatenings. If tho&s;e high
virtues be altogether &s;trangers to the mind,
the mild and gentle will certainly &s;ink un|der
the torrent of di&s;a&s;ters.&mdash;The ruler
in the text could plead, that his behaviour
to others, in the cour&s;e of &s;ocial life, had
been unexceptionable. So far, the reflec|tion
on his conduct would afford him com|fort
amid&s;t adver&s;ity. But no man is with|out
failings. In the dejecting &s;ea&s;on of
trouble, it will occur to every one, that he
has been guilty of frequent tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion;
that much of what ought to have been
done, was neglected; and that much of
what has been done, had better have been
omitted. In &s;uch &s;ituations, when a thou|&s;and
apprehen&s;ions ari&s;e to alarm con&s;cience,
nothing is able to quiet its unea&s;ine&s;s, ex|cept
a well-grounded tru&s;t in the mercy
and acceptance of Heaven. It is firm reli|gious
principle, acting upon a manly and
enlightened mind, that gives dignity to the
<PB N="299" REF="312">
character, and compo&s;ure to the heart, un|der
all the troubles of the world. This
enables the brave and virtuous man, with
&s;ucce&s;s to buffet the &s;torm. While he, who
had once &s;parkled in &s;ociety with all the
charms of gay vivacity, and had been the
delight of every circle in which he was
engaged, remains di&s;pirited, overwhelmed,
and annihilated, in the evil day.</P>
<P>SUCH are the failings incident to per&s;ons
of mixed and imperfect goodne&s;s: &s;uch
the defects of a character formed merely of
the amiable, without the e&s;timable quail|ties
of man.</P>
<P>It appears from this, that we mu&s;t not
place too much tru&s;t in the fair appear|ances,
which a character may at fir&s;t exhi|bit.
In judging of others, let us always
think the be&s;t, and employ the &s;pirit of
charity and candour. But in judging of
our&s;elves, we ought to be more &s;evere. Let
us remember him whom our Lord beheld,
and <HI>loved;</HI> and who yet fell &s;hort of the
kingdom of heaven. Let us not forget,
<PB N="300" REF="313">
that &s;omething more than gentlene&s;s and
mode&s;ty, than complacency of temper and
affability of manner, is requi&s;ite to form a
worthy man, or a true Chri&s;tian. To a
high place in our e&s;teem, the&s;e qualities are
ju&s;tly intitled. They enter e&s;&s;entially into
every good man's character. They form
&s;ome of its mo&s;t favourable di&s;tinctions.
But they con&s;titute a part of it; not the
whole. Let us not, therefore, re&s;t on them
entirely, when we conceive an idea of what
manner of per&s;ons we ought to be.</P>
<P>LET piety form the ba&s;is of firm and
e&s;tabli&s;hed virtue. If this be wanting, the
character cannot be &s;ound and entire. Mo|ral
virtue will always be endangered, often
be overthrown, when it is &s;eparated from
its &s;ure&s;t &s;upport. Confidence in God,
&s;trengthened by faith in the great Redeem|er
of mankind, not only, amid&s;t the &s;eve|rer
trials of virtue, gives con&s;tancy to the
mind, but, by nouri&s;hing the hope of im|mortality,
adds warmth and elevation to
the affections. They who&s;e conduct is not
<PB N="301" REF="314">
animated by religious principle, are depri|ved
of the mo&s;t powerful incentive to wor|thy
and honourable deeds.</P>
<P>Let &s;uch di&s;cipline, next, be &s;tudied, as
may form us to the active and manly vir|tues.
To natural good affections, we can
never entirely tru&s;t our conduct. The&s;e,
as has been &s;hown, may &s;ometimes be
warped into what is wrong; and often will
prove in&s;ufficient, for carrying us rightly
through all the duties of life. Good affec|tions
are highly valuable; but they mu&s;t
be &s;upported by fixed principles, cultivated
in the under&s;tanding, and rooted in the
heart. Habits mu&s;t be acquired of tempe|rance
and &s;elf-denial, that we may be able
to re&s;i&s;t plea&s;ure, and endure pain, when
either of them interfere with our duty;
that we may be prepared to make a &s;acri|fice
of any worldly intere&s;t, when the voice
of God and con&s;cience demand it. Let us
always remember, that without fortitude
of mind, there is no manhood; there can
be no per&s;everance in virtue. Let a &s;acred
and inviolable regard for truth reign in
<PB N="302" REF="315">
our whole behaviour. Let us be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
for fidelity to every promi&s;e we
have made; and for con&s;tancy in every
worthy friend&s;hip we have formed. Let
no weak complai&s;ance, no undue regard to
the opinions of men, ever make us betray
the rights of con&s;cience. What we have
once, upon due con&s;ideration, adopted as
rules of conduct, to the&s;e let us adhere un|&s;haken.
However the world may change
around us, let it find us the &s;ame in pro|&s;perity
and adver&s;ity; faithful to God and
virtue; faithful to the convictions of our
own heart. What our lot in the world
may be, is not ours to fore&s;ee or determine.
But it is ours to re&s;olve, that whatever it
&s;hall be, it &s;hall find us per&s;evering in one
line of uprightne&s;s and honour.</P>
<P>BY &s;uch di&s;cipline, &s;uch attentions as
the&s;e, we are to guard again&s;t tho&s;e fail|ings,
which are &s;ometimes found to &s;tain
the mo&s;t engaging characters. Joining in
proper union the amiable and the e&s;timable
qualities, by the one we &s;hall attract the
<PB N="303" REF="316">
good; and by the other, command re&s;pect
from the bad. We &s;hall both &s;ecure our
own integrity, and &s;hall exhibit to others a
proper view of what virtue is, in its native
grace and maje&s;ty. In one part of our
character, we &s;hall re&s;emble the flower that
&s;miles in &s;pring; in another, the firmly|rooted
tree, that braves the winter &s;torm.
For, remember we mu&s;t, that there is a
&s;ea&s;on of winter, as well as of &s;pring and
&s;ummer, in human life; and it concerns
us to be equally prepared for both.</P>
<P>A higher and more perfect example of
&s;uch a character as I now recommend,
cannot be found, that what is pre&s;ented to
us in the life of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. In him, we
behold all that is gentle, united with all
that is re&s;pectable. It is a remarkable ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
which the Apo&s;tle Paul employs
concerning him; <HI>I be&s;eech you by the meek|ne&s;s
and gentlene&s;s of Chri&s;t</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. x. 1.</NOTE>. Well might
the&s;e qualities be &s;ingled out, as tho&s;e for
which he was known and di&s;tingui&s;hed.
<PB N="304" REF="317">
We &s;ee him in his whole behaviour affable,
courteous, and ea&s;y of acce&s;s. He con|ver&s;ed
familiarly with all who pre&s;ented
them&s;elves; and de&s;pi&s;ed not the meane&s;t.
With all the infirmities of his di&s;ciples he
calmly bore; and his rebukes were mild,
when their provocations were great. He
wept over the calamities of his country,
which per&s;ecuted him; and apologi&s;ed and
prayed for them who put him to death.
Yet the &s;ame Je&s;us we behold, awful in the
&s;trictne&s;s of his virtue; inflexible in the
cau&s;e of truth; uncomplying with prevail|ing
manners, when he found them cor|rupt;
&s;etting his face boldly again&s;t the
hypocritical leaders of the people; over|awed
by none of their threatenings; in
the mo&s;t indignant terms, reproving their
vices, and &s;tigmatizing their characters.
We behold him gentle, without being tame;
firm, without being &s;tern; courageous,
without being violent. <HI>Let this mind be in
us which was al&s;o in Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> and we
&s;hall attain to honour, both with God and
with man.</P>

<P>WITH the&s;e words of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XV.</NOTE>
the Evangeli&s;t concludes his account
of the in&s;titution of the &s;acrament of the
Supper. It is an in&s;titution which, &s;olemn
and venerable in it&s;elf, is rendered &s;till more
&s;o, by the circum&s;tances which accompanied
<PB N="306" REF="319">
it. Our Lord had now, for about three
years, continued $word$ appear in his public
character, in the land of Judea. He had,
all along, been watched with a jealous eye,
by his enemies; and the time was come,
when they were to prevail again&s;t him. A
few friends he had, from the beginning,
&s;elected, who, in every vici&s;&s;itude of his
&s;tate, remained faithfully attached to him.
With the&s;e friends he was now meeting for
the la&s;t time, on the very evening in which
he was betrayed and &s;eized. He perfectly
knew all that was to befal him. He knew
that this was the la&s;t meal in which he was
to join with tho&s;e, who had been the com|panions
of all his labours, the confidents of
all his griefs; among whom he had pa&s;&s;ed
all the quiet and private moments of his life.
He knew, that within a few hours, he was
to be torn from this loved &s;ociety, by a
band of ruffians; and by to-morrow, was
to be publicly arraigned, as a malefactor.
With a heart melting with tenderne&s;s, he
&s;aid to the twelve Apo&s;tles, as he &s;at down
with them at table, <HI>With de&s;ire I have de&s;ired
<PB N="307" REF="320">
to eat this pa&s;&s;over with you before I &s;uffer</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Luke, xxii. 15.</NOTE>
And then, having gratified him&s;elf for the
la&s;t time in their &s;ociety, and having in&s;ti|tuted
that commemoration of his death
which was to continue in the Chri&s;tian
church until the end of ages, he took a &s;o|lemn
and affectionate farewell of his friends,
in the words of the text, <HI>I &s;ay unto you,
that I will not drink henceforth of this fruit
of the vine, until that day when I drink it
new with you in my Father's kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>As the&s;e words were uttered by our
Lord, in the pro&s;pect of his &s;ufferings;
when preparing him&s;elf for death, and
looking forward to a future meeting with
his friends in heaven; let us, under this
view, con&s;ider the &s;acrement, which he
then in&s;tituted, as a preparation for all the
&s;ufferings of life, and e&s;pecially, a prepa|ration
for death. It is fit and proper, that
&s;uch &s;olemn pro&s;pects &s;hould enter into the
&s;ervice which we are this day to perform.
We have no rea&s;on to imagine, that they
<PB N="308" REF="321">
will render it a gloomy &s;ervice. A good
and wi&s;e man is often di&s;po&s;ed to look for|ward
to the termination of life. The num|ber
of our days is determined by God; and
certainly it will not tend to &s;horten their
number, that we employ our&s;elves in pre|paring
for death. On the contrary, while
our days la&s;t, it will tend to make us pa&s;s
them more comfortably, and more wi&s;ely.
Let us now then, as if for the la&s;t time we
were to partake of this &s;acrament, con&s;ider
how it may &s;erve to prepare us for the dy|ing
hour.</P>
<P>1. IT is a high exerci&s;e of all tho&s;e di&s;po|&s;itions
and affections, in which a good man
would wi&s;h to die. He would &s;urely wi&s;h
to leave this world, in the &s;pirit of devo|tion
towards God, and of fellow&s;hip and
charity with all his brethren on earth.
Now, the&s;e are the very &s;entiments, which
the &s;acrament of the Lord's Supper in|&s;pires
into the heart of every pious com|municant.
It includes the highe&s;t acts of
devotion of which human nature is ca|pable.
<PB N="309" REF="322">
It imports, a lively &s;en&s;e of the in|finite
mercies of Heaven; of the gratitude
we owe to that God, who, by the death of
his Son, hath re&s;tored the forfeited happi|ne&s;s
and hopes of the human race. It im|ports,
the con&s;ecration of the &s;oul to God;
the entire re&s;ignation of our&s;elves, and all
our concerns, into his hands; as to the God
whom we &s;erve and love; the guardian in
whom we confide. <HI>To thee, O Lord, do I lift
up my &s;oul. I will go to that altar of God, to God
my exceeding joy. I will come into thy hou&s;e
in the multitude of thy mercy; and in thy fear,
I will wor&s;hip towards thy holy temple</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xliii. 4.; v. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e devout affections towards God are,
on this occa&s;ion, nece&s;&s;arily accompanied
with benevolent di&s;po&s;itions towards men,
Our communion is not only with God, but
with one another. In this &s;olemn &s;ervice,
the di&s;tinction of ranks is aboli&s;hed. We
a&s;&s;emble in common before our great
Lord, profe&s;&s;ing our&s;elves to be all mem|bers
of his family, and children of the
&s;ame Father. No feud, nor &s;trife, nor en|mity,
<PB N="310" REF="323">
is permitted to approach the &s;acred
table. All within that hallowed &s;pace
breathes peace, and concord, and love. <HI>If
thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there re|membere&s;t
that thy brother hath ought again&s;t
thee; leave there thy gift before the altar, and
go thy way; fir&s;t be reconciled to thy brother;
and then come and offer thy gift</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Matthew, v. 23. 24.</NOTE>. What can
be more becoming men and Chri&s;tians,
than &s;uch &s;entiments of piety to the great
Father of the univer&s;e; gratitude to the
merciful Redeemer of mankind; and cha|rity
and forgivene&s;s towards all our bre|thren?
Is not this the temper in which a
good man would wi&s;h to live? more e&s;pe|cially,
is not this the frame of mind which
will give both dignity and peace to his la&s;t
moments? How di&s;compo&s;ed and embit|tered
will the&s;e important moments prove,
if, with a mind &s;oured by the remembrance
of unforgiven injuries, with a brea&s;t rankled
by enmity, which a heart alienated from
God, and in&s;en&s;ible to devotion, one be
forced away from life?</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="324">
Contemplate the manner in which our
ble&s;&s;ed Lord died; which the &s;ervice of this
day brings particularly into your view.
You behold him, amid&s;t the extremity of
pain, calm and collected within him&s;elf;
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing his &s;pirit with all the &s;erenity
which &s;ublime devotion, and exalted bene|volence
in&s;pire. You hear him, fir&s;t, la|menting
the fate of his unhappy country;
next, when he was fa&s;tened to the cro&s;s,
addre&s;&s;ing words of con&s;olation to his af|flicted
parent; and la&s;tly, &s;ending up pray|ers,
mixed with compa&s;&s;ionate apologies,
for tho&s;e who were &s;hedding his blood.
After all tho&s;e exerci&s;es of charity, you be|hold
him in an act of devout adoration and
tru&s;t, re&s;igning his breath; <HI>Father, into thy
hands I commend my &s;pirit.</HI>&mdash;Can any death
be pronounced unhappy, how di&s;tre&s;sful &s;o|ever
its circum&s;tances may be, which is
thus &s;upported, and dignified? What could
we wi&s;h for more in our la&s;t moments, than
with this peaceful frame of mind, this calm
of all the affections, this exaltation of heart
<PB N="312" REF="325">
towards God, this diffu&s;ion of benevolence
towards men, to bid adieu to the world?</P>
<P>If, in &s;uch a &s;pirit as this, we would all
wi&s;h to die, let us think, that now is the
time to prepare for it, by &s;ea&s;onably cul|tivating
this &s;pirit while we live; by im|bibing,
in particular, from the holy &s;acra|ment,
tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions and affections
which we would wi&s;h to po&s;&s;e&s;s at our
late&s;t period. It is altogether vain to ima|gine,
that when the hour of death ap|proaches,
we &s;hall be able to form our|&s;elves
into the frame of mind which is then
mo&s;t proper and decent. Amid&s;t the &s;trug|gles
of nature, and under the load of &s;ick|ne&s;s
or pain, it is not time for unaccu&s;tom|ed
exertions to be made, or for new refor|mations
to be begun. <HI>Sufficient,</HI> and more
than &s;ufficient, <HI>for that day is the evil there|of.</HI>
It will be too late to a&s;&s;ume then the
hero, or the &s;aint, if we have been totally
unacquainted with the character before.
The &s;entiments we would di&s;play, and the
language we would utter, will be alien and
&s;trange to us. They will be forced, and fo|reign
<PB N="313" REF="326">
to the heart. It is only in con&s;e|quence
of habits acquired in former and
better days, that a temper of piety and
charity can grow up into &s;uch &s;trength, as
to confer peace and magnanimity on the
concluding hours of life. Peculiarly fa|vourable
to the acqui&s;ition of &s;uch a tem|per,
are the devotions of this day. In this
view, let us perform them; and &s;tudy to
be at the table of the Lord, what we would
wi&s;h to be when the &s;ummons of death &s;hall
come.</P>
<P>II. THIS &s;acrament becomes a prepara|tion
for death, by laying a foundation for
peace with God. What is important at the
clo&s;e of life, is not only the temper in
which we leave the world, but the &s;ituation
in which we &s;tand with re&s;pect to that
great Judge, before whom we are about to
appear. This view of our &s;ituation is apt
to e&s;cape us, during the ordinary cour&s;e of
life. Occupied with the affairs and con|cerns
of this world; flattered by tho&s;e illu|&s;ive
colours of innocence and virtue, in
<PB N="314" REF="327">
which &s;elf-love dre&s;&s;es up our character,
apprehen&s;ions of guilt create little unea&s;i|ne&s;s
to the multitude of men. But, on the
approach of death, their ideas change. As
the inqui&s;ition of the &s;upreme Judge draws
$igh, remembered tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions crowd up|on
the mind. Guilt becomes &s;trongly rea|li&s;ed
to the imagination; and alarms, be|fore
unknown, begin to ari&s;e. Hence the
anxiety, in the pro&s;pect of a future invi|&s;ible
world, which is &s;o often &s;een to attend
the bed of death. Hence tho&s;e various me|thods,
which &s;uper&s;tition has devi&s;ed for
quieting this anxiety; the trembling mind
eagerly gra&s;ping every feeble plank on
which it can lay hold; and flying for pro|tection
to the mo&s;t unavailing aid. The
&s;toute&s;t &s;pirits have been then known to
bend; the proude&s;t hearts, to be humbled.
They who are now mo&s;t thoughtle&s;s about
their &s;piritual concerns, may, perhaps, be
in this &s;tate before they die.</P>
<P>The di&s;pen&s;ation of grace, di&s;covered in
the go&s;pel, affords the only remedy again&s;t
tho&s;e terrors, by the promi&s;e of pardon, ex|tended
<PB N="315" REF="328">
to the penitent, through the merits
of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It is the very
e&s;&s;ence of this &s;acrament, to exhibit this
promi&s;ed grace to mankind; <HI>My body which
was broken for you; my blood &s;hed for many,
for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> Here, &s;hines from
above, the ray of hope. Divine ju&s;tice, we
are a&s;&s;ured, is not inexorable. Divine mer|cy
is acce&s;&s;ible, to all who believe and re|pent.
The participation of this &s;acrament,
Therefore naturally imparts comfort to the
Worthy communicant; as it &s;uppo&s;es, on
his part, a cordial compliance with tho&s;e
terms, on which pardon is offered by the
go&s;pel to mankind.</P>
<P>I mean not to &s;ay, that the participation
of this &s;acrament, how pious and proper
&s;oever our di&s;po&s;itions at the time may be,
is, of it&s;elf, &s;ufficient to en&s;ure us of com|fort
at death. It were unwarrantable to
flatter Chri&s;tians, with hopes to this extent.
No &s;ingle act of the mo&s;t fervent devotion
can afford a&s;&s;ured hopes of peace with Hea|ven,
until the&s;e hopes be confirmed by the
&s;ucceeding tenor of a good life. But what
<PB N="316" REF="329">
may &s;afely be a&s;&s;erted is, that communica|ting
in a proper manner, makes way for
&s;uch hopes. It is an introduction to that
&s;tate of reconciliation with God, which will
give you peace in death. It is the begin|ning
of a good cour&s;e, which, if duly pur|&s;ued,
will make your latter end ble&s;&s;ed. It
is the entrance of <HI>the path of the ju&s;t;</HI> the
morning of that <HI>light, which &s;hineth more
and more unto the perfect day.</HI> For this holy
&s;acrament is a profe&s;&s;ed renunciation of the
vices and corruptions of the world. It is
a profe&s;&s;ed dereliction of former evil ha|bits;
a &s;olemn return, on our part, to God
and virtue, under the firm tru&s;t, that God
will, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;how mercy to
the frailties of the penitent. If you conti|nue
to &s;upport the character which you
this day a&s;&s;ume, the invi&s;ible world will no
longer pre&s;ent to you a &s;cence of terrors.
You will be comforted with the view of
goodne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion, as predominant
in the admini&s;tration of the univer&s;e. Af|ter
having fini&s;hed a virtuous cour&s;e, you
will be able to look up to that God whom
<PB N="317" REF="330">
you have wor&s;hipped, and to &s;ay, <HI>I know
in whom I have tru&s;ted. Though I walk
through the valley of the &s;hadow of death, I
will fear no evil; for thou art with me. Thy
rod and thy &s;taff &s;hall comfort me.</HI></P>
<P>III. THIS &s;acrament prepares us for a
happy death, by &s;trengthening the connec|tion
between Chri&s;tians, and Chri&s;t their
Saviour. This is a connection which, in
various ways, redounds to their benefit;
and will be found particularly con&s;olatory
at the hour of death. The awful maje&s;ty
of Heaven is in danger of overwhelming
the mind, in the feeble moments of depart|ing
life. The reverence it in&s;pires is ming|led
with &s;en&s;ations of dread, which might
be too &s;trong for us then to bear. When
we look up to it, through a Mediator and
Interce&s;&s;or, that Maje&s;ty a&s;&s;umes a milder
a&s;pect, and appears to invite our approach.
Whatever, therefore, forms a connection
with this great Mediator, this powerful
friend and patron of the human race, mu&s;t
be mo&s;t de&s;irable to every one, e&s;pecially to
<PB N="318" REF="331">
the dying man. Now, this &s;acrament u|nites
us clo&s;ely with him. It is the oath of
our allegiance. It is the act of enli&s;ting
our&s;elves under the banner of this divine
Leader. Of cour&s;e, it &s;trengthens our faith
in him, as our guide through life, and our
guardian and protector in death. It gives
us a title to look up to him, under the
confidence of that reciprocal engagement,
which fidelity on the one hand is always
under&s;tood to imply, of protection on the
other.</P>
<P>His participation of our nature conveys
a degree of encouragement, which we could
derive from no being altogether cele&s;tial,
how gracious or benign &s;oever. In our ut|mo&s;t
extremity, we can have recour&s;e to
his &s;ympathizing aid, who had experience
both of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of life, and of the
terrors of death. We behold, in the text,
with what firm tranquillity he looked for|ward
to his approaching &s;ufferings. Sin|cere
attachment to our great Ma&s;ter, may
be expected to infu&s;e into us &s;ome degree
of the &s;ame happy compo&s;ure of mind. It
<PB N="319" REF="332">
is owing to our lo&s;ing out of view this per|fect
model; to our following the crowd,
and adopting the common &s;pirit of the
world, that we become mean-&s;pirited and
ba&s;e; &s;ervilely attached to life, and afraid
to die. Did we, according to our engage|ments
at the Lord's table, keep our eye
fixed on our divine Leader, and &s;tudy to
follow his &s;teps, a portion of this &s;pirit
would de&s;cend upon us at the hour of
death. It would be as the mantle of Eli|jah,
falling on a cho&s;en di&s;ciple; and would
enable us, as it did Eli&s;ha of old, to &s;mite,
and divide the waters.&mdash;We believe our
Saviour now to rule in the world of &s;pirits.
The grave, therefore, bars not his follow|ers
from acce&s;s to him. In the grave, for
our &s;ake, he once lay down, that he might
di&s;pel the gloom which appears to us to
cover that formidable man&s;ion. In a &s;hort
time he aro&s;e from it, in order to a&s;&s;ure us,
that the dark and narrow hou&s;e was not to
confine his followers for ever. By his
death, he conquered death; and him that
had the power of it; and his voice to us
<PB N="320" REF="333">
is, <HI>Becau&s;e I live, ye &s;hall live al&s;o.</HI> Hence,
as long as we pre&s;erve that attachment to
him which we this day profe&s;s, we are fur|ni&s;hed
with a variety of con&s;iderations pro|per
for &s;upporting us in the pro&s;pect of our
di&s;&s;olution.&mdash;This leads me to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>IV. THAT the &s;acrament of which we
are to partake, prepares us for death, by
confirming and enlivening our hope of im|mortality.
In this &s;acrament, my friends,
you act for both worlds. As inhabitants
of the earth, you are on this day to look
forward, with care, to your future beha|viour
in it. For you are not, by any means
di&s;engaging your&s;elves totally from this life,
and its concerns. On the contrary, you
are forming, and even &s;trengthening, tho&s;e
connections, which virtue requires you to
maintain with you friends, and fellow|creatures
around you.&mdash;At the &s;ame time,
you are not to con&s;ider your&s;elves as citi|zens
of earth only; but al&s;o as citizens of
heaven. You are to recogni&s;e, on this oc|ca&s;ion,
your relation to a higher and better
<PB N="321" REF="334">
country, with which you are connected by
the mo&s;t facred ties; and from which you
derive tho&s;e comforts and hopes, that will
both purify your life, and render your
death happy. The &s;acrament of the &s;upper
is, in this view, an a&s;cent of the mind a|bove
terre&s;trial things. At the Lord's table,
we a&s;&s;ociate our&s;elves, in &s;ome degree, with
&s;pirits of a more exalted order. We de|clare,
that we are tending towards their &s;o|ciety;
and have fixed our final re&s;t within
the veil. This view of the in&s;titution, &s;o
comfortable to the la&s;t period of life, is
plainly given us in the words of the text.
For it is worthy of particular ob&s;ervation,
that, as &s;oon as our Lord had in&s;tituted
this &s;acrament, he &s;traightway leads the
thoughts of his di&s;ciples to a &s;tate of future
exi&s;tence. Employing that metaphorical
&s;tyle, which the occa&s;ion naturally &s;ugge&s;t|ed,
he tells them, that though he was not
henceforth to drink of the fruit of the vine
on earth, yet a day was coming, when he
was again to drink it <HI>with them;</HI> to drink
it, <HI>in his Father's kingdom.</HI> Two di&s;tinct
<PB N="322" REF="335">
ideas are, in the&s;e words, pre&s;ented to us.
One is, the abode into which our Saviour
was to remove; <HI>his Father's kingdom.</HI> The
other, the &s;ociety which he was there to en|joy;
<HI>with you, in my Father's kingdom.</HI> The&s;e
corre&s;pond to the two views, under which
death is mo&s;t formidable to men; both of
which he intended to bani&s;h, by the in&s;ti|tution
of this &s;acrament: fir&s;t, that death
is a tran&s;ition to a new and unknown
world; and next, that it is a final &s;epara|tion
from all the friends whom we have
loved on earth.</P>
<P>FIRST; if death terminates our exi&s;tence
here, the abode to which it tran&s;lates the
faithful followers of Chri&s;t, is the kingdom
of his Father. The in&s;titution of this &s;a|crament
di&s;pels of the gloomy ideas of an|nihilation,
of non-exi&s;tence, of total dark|ne&s;s,
which our imagination is ready to a&s;|&s;ociate
with the grave. We are here a&s;&s;u|red,
that, to good men, death is not the
clo&s;e of being, but a change of &s;tate; a re|moval,
from a di&s;tant and ob&s;cure province
<PB N="323" REF="336">
of the univer&s;e, into the city of God,
the chief &s;eat of their Father's kingdom.
They have every rea&s;on to believe, that
the objects which are to meet them there,
how new and unknown &s;oever, &s;hall all be
propitious and friendly. For into the king|dom
of his Father, their Lord has decla|red,
that he is entered as their <HI>forerunner.
I go to my Father, and your Father; to my
God, and your God. In my Father's hou&s;e are
many man&s;ions. I go to prepare a place for
you. I will come again, and receive you to
my&s;elf, that where I am, there ye may be al&s;o.</HI>
What rea&s;onings, what &s;peculations, can
have power to impart &s;o much peace to the
dying man, as a promi&s;e &s;o direct and ex|plicit,
coming from him who is truth it&s;elf,
and cannot lie? <HI>If it were not &s;o, I would
have told you</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">John, xiv. 2.</NOTE> The pro&s;pect becomes &s;till
more chearing and relieving, when we in|clued,</P>
<P>THE other circum&s;tance mentioned in
<PB N="324" REF="337">
the text; the &s;ociety to be enjoyed in that
future &s;tate of being. <HI>With you, I &s;hall
drink of the fruit of the vine in my Father's
kingdom.</HI> In how amiable a light does our
Saviour here appear, looking forward to a
future reunion with tho&s;e beloved friends,
whom he was now leaving, as to a circum|&s;tance
which &s;hould increa&s;e both his own
felicity and theirs, when they met again in
a happier world! Thus, in the mo&s;t affec|tionate
manner, chearing their drooping
and dejected &s;pirits; and, by a &s;imilar pro|&s;pects,
providing for the comfort of his fol|lowers
in future generations, when they
&s;hould be about to leave the world.</P>
<P>The expre&s;&s;ions in the text plainly &s;ugge&s;t
a joyful intercour&s;e among friends, who
had been &s;eparated by death: and therefore
&s;eem to give much confirmation, to what
has always been a favourite hope of good
men; that friends &s;hall know and recog|ni&s;e
each other, and renew their former
connections, in a future &s;tate of exi&s;tence.
How many plea&s;ing pro&s;pects, does &s;uch an
intimation open to the mind! How much
<PB N="325" REF="338">
does it tend to compen&s;ate the vanity of life,
and to mitigate the &s;orrows of death! For
it is not to be denied, that one of the mo&s;t
bitter circum&s;tances attending death, is the
final &s;eparation from beloved friends. This
is apt equally to wring the hearts of the
dying, and the &s;urviving; and it is an an|gui&s;h
of that &s;ort, which de&s;cends mo&s;t
deeply into the virtuous and worthy brea&s;t.
When, &s;urrounded with an affectionate fa|mily,
and weeping friends, a good man is
taking his la&s;t adieu of all whom he held
mo&s;t dear on earth; when, with a feeble
voice, he is giving them his ble&s;&s;ing, before
he leaves them for ever; when, for the
la&s;t time, he beholds the countenance, he
touches the hand, he hears the voice, of the
per&s;on neare&s;t his heart; who could bear
this bitterne&s;s of grief, if no &s;upport were
to be mini&s;tered by religious hope? if there
were no voice to whi&s;per to our &s;pirits, that
hereafter we, and tho&s;e whom we love,
&s;hall meet again in a more bli&s;sful land?
&mdash;What higher view can po&s;&s;ibly be gi|ven,
of the benefit redounding from this
<PB N="326" REF="339">
divine in&s;titution, than its affording us con|&s;olation
in &s;uch &s;ituations of extreme di|&s;tre&s;s,
by reali&s;ing to our &s;ouls the belief
of an immortal &s;tate, in which all the vir|tuous
and worthy &s;hall be reunited in the
pre&s;ence of their common Lord?</P>
<P>THUS I have &s;et before you many con&s;i|derations,
ari&s;ing from the &s;acrament of
our Lord's &s;upper, which render it a pro|per
preparation, not only for a good life,
but for a comfortable and happy death.
The great improvement to be made of the
&s;ubject is, to bring to the altar of God
&s;uch di&s;po&s;itions of heart, as may give us
ground to hope for this ble&s;&s;ed effect. Let
us approach to the &s;acrament with the &s;ame
&s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of frame, as if it were the la&s;t
time we were ever to partake of it; as if we
were now making provi&s;ion for a journey
to that land whence none return; as if we
were never to <HI>drink,</HI> in this manner, <HI>of the
fruit of the vine, until that day when we drink
it,</HI> with tho&s;e whom we have loved, <HI>in our
Father's kingdom.</HI>&mdash;God only knows to
<PB N="327" REF="340">
whom this may be truly &s;poken! God
knows who, of this a&s;&s;embly, &s;hall never
have opportunity to approach again to the
&s;acred table, and to meet with their bre|thren,
on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, in the courts
of the Lord's hou&s;e!&mdash;Whatever our doom
is to be, whether we are appointed for life
or for death, &s;uch is the frame of mind
which now be&s;t becomes, and will mo&s;t
improve us, in partaking of the holy &s;acra|ment.</P>
<P>LET me caution you, before I conclude,
again&s;t judging of the propriety of your
di&s;po&s;ition in this &s;olemn act of wor&s;hip,
&s;olely by the warmth of your affections,
and the fervour of your devotion. This
&s;tate of heart, how de&s;irable &s;oever it may
be, cannot be at all times po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. It de|pends,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, on natural &s;en&s;i|bility.
All are not equally endowed with
warm and tender feelings. Even they who
are &s;u&s;ceptible of the highe&s;t degrees of
pious and virtuous &s;en&s;ibility, cannot, on
every occa&s;ion, command that happy tem|perature
<PB N="328" REF="341">
of mind. We are not, therefore,
to judge unfavourably of our&s;elves, if this
be not always the privilege of our devo|tions.
It is chiefly a &s;edate and compo|&s;ed
frame of &s;pirit, that we mu&s;t &s;tudy to
cultivate; ari&s;ing from grave and &s;ober
thoughts; from &s;erious and penitent recol|lection
of pa&s;t errors; from good purpo&s;es
for the future; and from a deep &s;en&s;e of
the approaching events of death and im|mortality.
Penetrated with &s;uch di&s;po&s;i|tions,
you have ground to come to the al|tar
of God with humble tru&s;t and joy;

through the great Redeemer, to that mer|ciful

<P>THE world is always repre&s;ented in
Scripture as the great &s;cene of trial to
a Chri&s;tian.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XVI.</NOTE> It &s;ets before him a variety of
duties, which are incumbent on him to per|form;
and, at the &s;am time, &s;urrounds
him with many dangers, again&s;t which he
has to guard. The part which is proper
for him to act, may be compri&s;ed in the&s;e
two expre&s;&s;ive words of the text; <HI>u&s;ing the
world, and not abu&s;ing it;</HI> the &s;ignificancy
and extent of which, I purpo&s;e now to ex|plain.
The &s;ubject is of the higher im|portance,
<PB N="330" REF="343">
as in the world we mu&s;t live;
and according as we u&s;e, or abu&s;e it, it will
prove either our friend, or our greate&s;t
foe.</P>
<P>It is natural to begin with ob&s;erving,
that the Chri&s;tian is here &s;uppo&s;ed to <HI>u&s;e
the world;</HI> by which we mu&s;t certainly un|der&s;tand
the Apo&s;tle to mean, maintaining
intercour&s;e and connection with the world;
living in it, as one of the members of hu|man
&s;ociety; a&s;&s;uming that rank which
belongs to his &s;tation. No one can be &s;aid
to <HI>u&s;e the world</HI> who lives not thus. Hence
it follows, that &s;eque&s;tration from the world
is no part of Chri&s;tian duty; and it ap|pears
&s;trange, that even among tho&s;e who
approve not of mona&s;tick confinement, &s;e|clu&s;ion
from the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety &s;hould
have been &s;ometimes con&s;idered, as belong|ing
to the character of a religious man.
They have been &s;uppo&s;ed to be the be&s;t
&s;ervants of God, who, con&s;ecrating their
time to the exerci&s;es of devotion, mingle
lea&s;t in the ordinary commerce of the
world; and e&s;pecially who ab&s;tain mo&s;t
<PB N="331" REF="344">
rigidly from all that has the appearance of
amu&s;ement. But how pious and &s;incere
&s;oever the intentions of &s;uch per&s;ons may
be, they certainly take not the propere&s;t
method, either for improving them&s;elves, or
for advancing religion among others. For
this is not u&s;ing the world, but relinqui&s;h|ing
it. In&s;tead of making the light of a
good example &s;hine with u&s;eful &s;plendour
throughout the circle of &s;ociety, they con|fine
it within a narrow compa&s;s. Accord|ing
to the metaphor employed by our Sa|viour,
after the <HI>candle is lighted, they put it
under a bu&s;hel.</HI> In&s;tead of recommending
religion to the world, they exhibit it un|der
the forbidding a&s;pect of unnece&s;&s;ary au|&s;terity.
In&s;tead of employing their influ|ence,
to regulate and temper the plea&s;ures
of the world, by a moderate participation
of tho&s;e that are innocent, they deliver up
all the entertainments of &s;ociety, into the
hands of the loo&s;e and giddy.</P>
<P>The various dangers which the world
pre&s;ents to one who is de&s;irous of main|taining
his piety and integrity, have given
<PB N="332" REF="345">
ri&s;e to this &s;crupulous caution concerning
the u&s;e of the world; and &s;o far, the prin|ciple
is commendable. But we mu&s;t re|member,
that the virtue of a Chri&s;tian is
to be &s;hown, in &s;urmounting dangers which
he is called o encounter. Into the po&s;t of
danger we were ordered by Providence,
when we were brought into this world.
We were placed as &s;oldiers, on the field of
battle. It is there, that our fidelity to our
great Commander mu&s;t appear. The mo&s;t
&s;ignal virtues which adorn and improve the
human character, are di&s;played in active
life. There, the &s;trength of the mind is
brought forth, and put to the te&s;t. There,
all the amiable di&s;po&s;itions of the heart find
their proper exerci&s;e: humanity is culti|vated;
patience, fortitude, and &s;elf-denial,
come forward in all their forms; and the
light of good men's works &s;o &s;hines before
others, as to lead them to <HI>glorify their Fa|ther
which is in heaven.</HI></P>
<P>It may be a&s;&s;umed, therefore, as a prin|ciple
ju&s;tified by the text, and by the whole
&s;train of Scripture, that <HI>to u&s;e,</HI> and in a cer|tain
<PB N="333" REF="346">
degree to enjoy, <HI>the world,</HI> is altoge|ther
con&s;i&s;tent with religion. According
to the rank which men po&s;&s;e&s;s in &s;ociety,
according to their age, their employment
and connections, their intercour&s;e with the
world will be more or le&s;s extended. In
private life, they u&s;e the world with pro|priety,
who are active and indu&s;trious in
their callings; ju&s;t and upright in their
dealings; &s;ober, contented, and chearful in
their &s;tation. When the circum&s;tances of
men allow them a wider command of the
enjoyments of the world, of tho&s;e enjoy|ments
they may freely partake, within the
bounds of temperance, moderation, and
decency. The highe&s;t &s;ituations of rank
and opulence, ought to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by
dignity of character; by exten&s;ive benefi|cence,
u&s;efulne&s;s, and public &s;pirit; by
magnificence, without o&s;tentation; and ge|nerous
ho&s;pitality, without profu&s;ion.</P>
<P>We &s;hall have a clearer view of the pro|per
u&s;e of the world, when we contra&s;t it
with that abu&s;e of the world, which we too
often ob&s;erve. Tho&s;e abu&s;es manife&s;t them|&s;elves
<PB N="334" REF="347">
in various forms; but in general may
be cla&s;&s;ed under three great heads.</P>
<P>I. They are abu&s;ers of the world, who
intemperately give them&s;elves up to its plea|&s;ures,
and lead a life of licentiou&s;ne&s;s,
riot, and di&s;&s;ipation. Amid&s;t the wealth
and luxury of the pre&s;ent age, it will be
admitted, that per&s;ons of this de&s;cription
are not unfrequent, who, being opulent in
fortune, and perhaps high in rank, think
them&s;elves intitled to pa&s;s their days in a
carele&s;s manner, without any other object
in view, than the gratification of their &s;en&s;es
and pa&s;&s;ions. It &s;hall be granted, that they
are not obliged to that exact oeconomy and
attention in their manner of living, which
the &s;tate of fortune may require of others.
Gaiety &s;hall be permitted to them; change
of &s;cene, and variety of amu&s;ements. But
let them not forget, that as men and mem|bers
of &s;ociety, not to &s;ay profe&s;&s;ors of the
Chri&s;tian faith, they are bound to &s;top &s;hort
in their career of plea&s;ure, as &s;oon as it be|comes
di&s;graceful to them&s;elves, and hurt|ful
<PB N="335" REF="348">
to the world. By the train of life which
they lead, they defeat every purpo&s;e for
which Providence be&s;towed on them the
ble&s;&s;ings of pro&s;perity. They &s;ink every
talent which they po&s;&s;e&s;s, into u&s;ele&s;s in&s;ig|nificancy.
They corrupt the public man|ners
by their examples; and diffu&s;e among
others the &s;pirit of extravagance and folly.
They behave in a manner altogether un|&s;uitable
to the condition of the world in
which we live; where we are expo&s;ed to &s;o
much change, &s;urrounded with &s;o much
di&s;tre&s;s, and daily behold &s;o many affecting
&s;cenes, as ought to awaken &s;erious reflec|tion,
and cha&s;ten di&s;&s;olute mirth.</P>
<P>With indignant eyes, the &s;ober and think|ing
part of mankind, view the luxury and
riot of tho&s;e abu&s;ers of the world. To them
are owing the di&s;contents of the poor, their
di&s;affection to their &s;uperiors, their prone|ne&s;s
to di&s;turb the peace of the world.
When the poor behold wealth properly
u&s;ed, they look up with re&s;pect to them
who po&s;&s;e&s;s it. They re&s;t contented in
their &s;tation; and ble&s;s the ju&s;t and the ge|nerous,
<PB N="336" REF="349">
from who&s;e munificence they re|ceive
employment and reward. But when
they behold tho&s;e men of plea&s;ure di&s;&s;ipa|ting,
in vice and folly, the fortune which
their forefathers had honourably earned;
when they behold them oppre&s;&s;ing all their
dependents, merely that they may revel in
luxurious extravagance, then their hearts
&s;well within them; with murmurs of &s;ul|len
grief, they eye their own mean habita|tion,
and needy family; and become pre|pared
for robbery, tumult, &s;edition, and
every evil work.</P>
<P>The conduct of &s;uch abu&s;ers of the
world, is not only pernicious to the wel|fare
of &s;ociety, and to the intere&s;ts of vir|tue;
it is equally ruinous to them&s;elves.
I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on the lo&s;s of reputation,
the wa&s;te of fortune, the broken health,
and debilitated frame, which are the well|known
con&s;equences of a life of intempe|rate
plea&s;ure. I &s;hall not recount all the
better and more &s;ub&s;tantial enjoyments
which they forfeit. Amid&s;t the turbulence
of riot, and the fumes of intoxication, un|known
<PB N="337" REF="350">
to them are the rational entertain|ments
of regular life; the enjoyment of the
face of nature; the plea&s;ures of knowledge,
and an improved mind; the plea&s;ures of
private friend&s;hip, and dome&s;tic &s;ociety;
the con&s;cious &s;atisfaction which accompa|nies
honourable labours, and the ju&s;tly ac|quired
e&s;teem of tho&s;e who &s;urround them.
All the&s;e they have thrown away; and in
their room have &s;ub&s;tituted, what they
think more high and vivid plea&s;ures. But
of what nature are tho&s;e plea&s;ures? <HI>Even in
laughter the heart is &s;orrowful; and the end of
that mirth is heavine&s;s</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At the bottom of the hearts of all men,
there lies a &s;ecret &s;en&s;e of propriety, virtue,
and honour. This &s;en&s;e may be &s;o far blunt|ed,
as to lo&s;e its influence in guiding men to
what is right, while yet it retains its power
of making them feel that they are acting
wrong. Hence remor&s;e often gnaws the
heart, which affects to appear light, and gay,
before the world. Among the crowd of a|mu&s;ements,
<PB N="338" REF="351">
the voluptuary may endea|deavour
to &s;tifle his unea&s;ine&s;s; but through
all his defences it will penetrate. A con|&s;cious
&s;en&s;e of his own in&s;ignificance, when
he &s;ees others di&s;tingui&s;hed for acting a
manly and worthy part; reflection on the
time he has wa&s;ted, and the contempt he
has incurred; the galling remembrance of
his earlier and better days, when he gave
the fair promi&s;e of accompli&s;hments, which
now are bla&s;ted, have frequently been found
to &s;adden the fe&s;tive hour. The noi&s;e of
merriment may be heard; but heavine&s;s
lies at the heart. While the tabret and the
viol play, a melancholy voice founds in his
ears. The wa&s;ted e&s;tate, the neglected halls,
and ruined man&s;ion of his fathers, ri&s;e to
view. The angry countenances of his
friends, &s;eem to &s;tare him in the face. A
hand appears to come forth on the wall,
and to write his doom.</P>
<P>Retreat then, from your di&s;honourable
cour&s;es, ye who by licentiou&s;ne&s;s, extra|vagance,
and vice, are abu&s;ers of the world!
you are degrading, you are ruining your|&s;elves.
<PB N="339" REF="352">
You are gro&s;sly mi&s;employing the
gifts of God; and the giver will not fail to
puni&s;h. Awake to the pur&s;uits of men of
virtue, and honour. Break loo&s;e from that
magic circle, within which you are at pre|&s;ent
held. Reject the poi&s;oned cup which
the enchantre&s;s Plea&s;ure holds up to your
lips. Draw a&s;ide the veil which &s;he throws
over your eyes. You will then &s;ee other
objects than you now behold. You will
&s;ee a dark aby&s;s opening below your feet.
You will &s;ee virtue and temperance mark|ing
out the road, which conducts to true
felicity. You will be enabled to di&s;cern, that
the world is enjoyed to advantage, by none
but &s;uch as follow tho&s;e divine guides; and
who con&s;ider plea&s;ure as the &s;ea&s;oning, but
not as the bu&s;ine&s;s of life.</P>
<P>II. THE world is abu&s;ed, not only by an
intemperate pur&s;uit of its plea&s;ures, but by
a fordid attachment to its gains. This re&s;pects
a &s;et of men of very different de|&s;cription
from the former; more decent in
their carriage, and le&s;s flagrant in their
<PB N="340" REF="353">
vices; but corrupted by the world in no
le&s;s a degree. For the world is often abu&s;ed
by the men of bu&s;ine&s;s, as much as by the
men of plea&s;ure. When worldly &s;ucce&s;s
becomes the &s;ole object of their life; when
the accumulation of fortune &s;o engro&s;&s;es
them, as to harden their heart again&s;t eve|ry
feeling of moral obligation; when it
renders them in&s;en&s;ible to the calls of af|fection,
and to the impre&s;&s;ions of piety
and religion; they then come under the
cla&s;s of the covetous, whom, it is &s;aid, <HI>the
Lord abhorreth</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm x. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>The world, with its advantages, is a
lawful object of pur&s;uit to a Chri&s;tian.
He may &s;eek, by fair indu&s;try, to ren|der
his circum&s;tances affluent. Without
reproof, he may aim at di&s;tinction and
con&s;ideration in the world. He may be|&s;tow
a con&s;iderable portion of his time and
attention, on the &s;ucce&s;sful management of
his worldly intere&s;ts. All this is within the
limits of that allowable u&s;e of the world, to
which religion gives its &s;anction. But to
<PB N="341" REF="354">
a wi&s;e and good man, the world is only a
&s;econdary object. He remembers there is
an eternity beyond it. His care is, not
merely to ama&s;s and po&s;&s;e&s;s, but to u&s;e his
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions well, as one who is accountable
to God, He is not a &s;lave, either to the
hopes, or the fears of the world. He would
rather forfeit any pre&s;ent advantage, than
obtain it at the expence of violating the di|vine
law or neglecting his duty. This is
u&s;ing the world like a good man. This is
living in it, as a &s;ubject of God, and a
member of the great community of man|kind.
To &s;uch a man, riches are a ble&s;|&s;ing.
He may enjoy them with magnifi|cence;
but he will u&s;e them with liberali|ty.
They open a wide field to the exerci&s;e
of his virtue, and allow it to &s;hine with
diffu&s;ive lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>Very oppo&s;ite to this, is the character of
the worldly-minded. To them, the mere
attainment of earthly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, is an ulti|mate
aim. They cannot be &s;aid to <HI>u&s;e the
world;</HI> for to po&s;&s;e&s;s, not to u&s;e or enjoy,
is their object. They are emphatically &s;aid
<PB N="342" REF="355">
in Scripture, to <HI>load them&s;elves with thick
clay</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Habakkuk, ii. 6.</NOTE> Some &s;ort of apology may be framed
for them who &s;eek to extract from the
world, plea&s;ure of one kind or other. But
for tho&s;e who know no plea&s;ure, farther
than <HI>adding hou&s;e to hou&s;e, and field to field,</HI>
and calling them their own, it is hardly
po&s;&s;ible to frame any apology. Such per|&s;ons
are idolaters of the wor&s;t kind; for
they have made the world their God. They
daily wor&s;hip and bow down before it;
and hold nothing to be mean or ba&s;e, which
can promote the enlargement of their for|tune.
&mdash;He is an abu&s;er of the world, let
his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it be ever &s;o ample, who
knows nothing higher than the gains of the
world. He is an abu&s;er of the world, who
&s;acrifices probity, virtue, or humanity, to
its intere&s;ts. He is an abu&s;er of the world,
who cannot occa&s;ionally retreat from it, to
con&s;ider what character he bears in the
&s;ight of God; and to what i&s;&s;ue his con|duct
will bring him at la&s;t. In a word, the
<PB N="343" REF="356">
world is then properly u&s;ed, when it is ge|nerou&s;ly
and beneficently enjoyed; neither
hoarded up by avarice, nor &s;quandered by
o&s;tentation.</P>
<P>III. THE world is abu&s;ed, by tho&s;e who
employ its advantages to the injury or op|pre&s;&s;ion
of their brethren. Under this cla&s;s
are included, the world and mo&s;t criminal
abu&s;ers of the world; who turn again&s;t
their fellow - creatures, tho&s;e advantages
with which it has plea&s;ed Heaven to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
them. It is a cla&s;s which compre|hends,
the &s;overeign who tyranni&s;es over his
people; the great man who oppre&s;&s;es his
dependents; the ma&s;ter who is cruel to his
&s;ervants; every one, in fine, who renders
his &s;uperiority of any kind, whether of
wealth or power, unnece&s;&s;arily grievous to
tho&s;e who are his inferiors: Who&s;e &s;uper|ciliou&s;ne&s;s
dejects the mode&s;t; who&s;e in&s;o|lence
tramples on the poor; who&s;e rigour
makes the widow and the orphan weep.
Per&s;ons of this character, while thus abu|&s;ing
<PB N="344" REF="357">
the advantages of the world, may, for
a while, enjoy their triumph. But let them
not think, their triumph is always to la&s;t.
Their turn &s;hall come, to be humbled as
low as tho&s;e whom they now oppre&s;s. For
there is a vigilant eye ill the heavens, atten|tive
to ob&s;erve their procedure. There is
an impartial ear, which li&s;tens to every ju&s;t
complaint preferred again&s;t them. There
is an irre&s;i&s;tible arm &s;tretched over their
heads, who&s;e weight they &s;hall one day
feel. The Sovereign of the univer&s;e cha|racteri&s;es
him&s;elf in the &s;acred writings, as
peculiarly an adver&s;ary to the in&s;olent and
haughty. <HI>For the oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor, for
the &s;ighing of the needy, now will I ari&s;e, &s;aith

<P>After hearing the&s;e awful words, is it
not &s;range, O men, at once infatuated and
cruel! that you cannot u&s;e the world, with|out

Even &s;uppo&s;ing no puni&s;hment to

below you in the world? Is it not enough,
that they &s;uffer their own hard fate, with|out

then, and then only, we <HI>u&s;e the
world,</HI> as becomes men, and Chri&s;tians.
Within the&s;e limits, we may &s;afely enjoy
all the comforts which the world affords,
and our &s;tation allows. But if we pa&s;s be|yond
the&s;e boundaries, into the regions of
di&s;orderly and vicious plea&s;ure, of deba&s;ing
covetou&s;ne&s;s, or of oppre&s;&s;ive in&s;olence, the
world will then &s;erve only to corrupt our
minds, and to accelerate our ruin. The
licentious, the avaricious, and the in&s;olent,
form the three great cla&s;&s;es of abu&s;ers of
the world.</P>
<P>Let not tho&s;e who are in wealthy and
flouri&s;hing circum&s;tances, complain of the
re&s;traints which religious doctrine attempts
to impo&s;e on their enjoyments. For, to
what do the&s;e re&s;traints amount? To no
more than this, that, by their plea&s;ures,
they would neither injure them&s;elves, nor
injure others. We call not on the young,
to relinqui&s;h their gaiety; nor on the rich,
<PB N="349" REF="362">
to forego their opulence; nor on the great,
to lay a&s;ide their &s;tate. We only call on
them, not to convert gaiety into licentiou&s;|ne&s;s;
not to employ opulence in mere ex|travagance;
nor to abu&s;e greatne&s;s for the
oppre&s;&s;ion of their inferiors: While they
enjoy the world, not to forget that they are
the &s;ubjects of God, and are &s;oon to pa&s;s

which the Apo&s;tle enforces the exhortation
in the text, pre&s;ent it&s;elf to their thought;
<HI>U&s;e this world as not abu&s;ing it; for the fa|&s;hion

&s;how. Every thing that we here enjoy,
changes, decays, and comes to an end. All
floats on the &s;urface of a river, which, with
&s;wift current, is running towards a bound|le&s;s
ocean. Beyond this pre&s;ent &s;cene of
things, above the&s;e &s;ublunary regions, we
are to look for what is permanent and
&s;table. The world pa&s;&s;es away; but God,

it will not be enough that there are
good di&s;po&s;itions in the heart. Without
regular guidance, they will often err from
the right &s;cope. They will be always wa|vering
<PB N="352" REF="365">
and un&s;teady; nay, on &s;ome occa|&s;ions,
they may betray us into evil. This
is too much verified by that propen&s;ity to
run into extremes, which &s;o often appears
in the behaviour of men. How many have
originally &s;et out with good principles, and
intentions, who, through want of di&s;cre|tion
in the application of their principles,
have in the end injured them&s;elves, and
brought di&s;credit on religion? There is a
certain temperate mean, in the ob&s;ervance
of which, piety and virtue con&s;i&s;t. On
each &s;ide there lies a dangerous extreme.
Bewildering paths open; by deviating into
which, men are apt to forfeit all the prai&s;e
of their good intentions; and to fini&s;h
with reproach, what they had begun with
honour. This is the ground of the wi&s;e
man's exhortation in the text. <HI>Let thine
eyes look right on, and let thine eye-lids look
&s;traight before thee. Ponder the path of thy
feel, and let all thy ways be e&s;tabli&s;hed. Turn
not to the right hand, nor to the left; remove
thy foot from evil.</HI> In di&s;cour&s;ing from the&s;e
words, I purpo&s;e to point out &s;ome of the
<PB N="353" REF="366">
extremes into which men are apt to run in
religion and morals; and to &s;ugge&s;t direc|tions
for guarding again&s;t them.</P>
<P>WITH regard to religious principle in
general, it may perhaps be expected, that
I &s;hould warn you of the danger of being,
on one hand, too rigid in adhering to it,
and, on the other hand, too ea&s;y in relax|ing
it. But the di&s;tinction between the&s;e
&s;uppo&s;ed extremes, I conceive to have no
foundation. No man can be too &s;trict, in
his adherence to a principle of duty. Here,
there is no extreme. All relaxation of prin|ciple,
is criminal. What con&s;cience dictates
is to be ever obeyed. Its commands are
univer&s;ally &s;acred. Even though it &s;hould
be mi&s;led, yet, as long as we conceive it to
utter the voice of God, in di&s;obeying it we
&s;in. The error, therefore, to be here a|voided
is, not too &s;crupulous or tender re|gard
to con&s;cience, but too little care to
have con&s;cience properly enlightened, with
re&s;pect to what is matter of duty and of
&s;in.&mdash;Receive not, without examination,
<PB N="354" REF="367">
whatever human tradition has con&s;ecrated
as &s;acred. Recur, on every occa&s;ion, to
tho&s;e great fountains of light and know|ledge,
which are opened to you in the pure
word of God. Di&s;tingui&s;h, with care, be|tween
the &s;uper&s;titious fancies of men, and
the everla&s;ting commandments of God.
Exhau&s;t not on trifles that zeal, which
ought to be re&s;erved for the weightier mat|ters
of the law. Overload not conscience,
with what is frivolous and unnece&s;&s;ary.
But when you have once drawn the line,
with intelligence and preci&s;ion, between
duty and &s;in, that line you ought on no
occa&s;ion to tran&s;gre&s;s.</P>
<P>THOUGH there is no extreme in the reve|rence
due to con&s;cience, there may un|doubtedly
be an extreme, in laying too
much &s;tre&s;s, either on mere principle, or
on mere practice. Here we mu&s;t take par|ticular
care, not to <HI>turn to the right hand,
nor to the left;</HI> but to <HI>hold faith and a good
con&s;cience</HI> united, as the Scripture, with great
<PB N="355" REF="368">
propriety, exhorts us<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">1. Timothy, i. 19.</NOTE> The error of re&s;t|ing
wholly on faith, or wholly on works,
is one of tho&s;e &s;eductions, which mo&s;t ea|&s;ily
mi&s;lead men; under the &s;emblance of
piety on the one hand, and of virtue on
the other. This is not an error peculiar to
our times. It has obtained in every age of
the Chri&s;tian church. It has run through
all the different modes of fal&s;e religion. It
forms the chief di&s;tinction of all the va|rious
&s;ects which have divided, and which
&s;till continue to divide the church; accord|ing
as they have leaned mo&s;t to the &s;ide of
belief, or to the &s;ide of morality.</P>
<P>Did we li&s;ten candidly to the voice of Scrip|ture,
it would guard us again&s;t either extreme.
The Apo&s;tle Paul every where te&s;tifies, that
by no works of our own we can be ju&s;ti|fied;
and that <HI>without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible
to plea&s;e God.</HI> The Apo&s;tle James as clear|ly
&s;hows, that faith, if it be unproductive
of good works, ju&s;tifies no man. Between
tho&s;e &s;entiments, there is no oppo&s;ition.
<PB N="356" REF="369">
Faith without works, is nugatory and in|&s;ignificant.
It is a foundation, without any
&s;uper&s;tructure rai&s;ed upon it. It is a foun|tain
which &s;ends forth no &s;tream; a tree
which neither bears fruit, nor affords &s;hade.
Good works, again, without good princi|ples,
are a fair, but airy &s;tructure; without
firmne&s;s or &s;tability. They re&s;emble the
hou&s;e built on the &s;and; the reed which
&s;hakes with every wind. You mu&s;t join
the two in full union, if you would exhi|bit
the character of a real Chri&s;tian. He
who &s;ets faith in oppo&s;ition to morals, or
morals in oppo&s;ition to faith, is equally an
enemy to the intere&s;ts of religion. He
holds up to view an imperfect and disfi|gured
form; in the room of what ought to
command re&s;pect from all beholders. By
leaning to one extreme, he is in danger of
falling into vice; by the other, of running
into impiety.</P>
<P>WHATEVER the belief of men be, they
generally pride them&s;elves, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of &s;ome good moral qualities. The &s;en&s;e
<PB N="357" REF="370">
of duty is deeply rooted in the human
heart. Without &s;ome pretence to virtue,
there is no &s;elf-e&s;teem; and no man wi&s;hes
to appear in his own view, as entirely
worthle&s;s. But as there is a con&s;tant &s;trife
between the lower and higher parts of our
nature, between inclination and principle,
this produces much contradiction and in|con&s;i&s;tency
in conduct. Hence ari&s;e mo&s;t
of the extremes, into which men run in
their moral behaviour; re&s;ting their whole
worth on that good quality, to which, by
con&s;titution or temper, they are mo&s;t in|clined.</P>
<P>ONE of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t common of
tho&s;e extremes, is that of placing all virtue,
either in ju&s;tice, on the one hand; or in
genero&s;ity, on the other. The oppo&s;ition
between the&s;e, is mo&s;t di&s;cernible among
two different cla&s;&s;es of men in &s;ociety.
They who have earned their fortune by a
laborious and indu&s;trious life, are naturally
tenacious of what they have painfully ac|quired.
To ju&s;tice, they con&s;ider them|&s;elves
<PB N="358" REF="371">
as obliged; but to go beyond it in
acts of kindne&s;s, they con&s;ider as &s;uper|fluous
and extravagant. They will not
take any advantage of others, which con|&s;cience
tells them is iniquitous; but nei|ther
will they make any allowance for their
nece&s;&s;ities and wants. They contend, with
rigorous exactne&s;s, for what is due to them|&s;elves.
They are &s;atisfied, if no man &s;uf|fer
unju&s;tly by them. That no one is be|nefited
by them, gives them little concern.
&mdash;Another &s;et of men place their whole
merit in genero&s;ity and mercy; while to
ju&s;tice and integrity they pay &s;mall regard.
The&s;e are per&s;ons generally of higher rank,
and of ea&s;y fortune. To them, ju&s;tice ap|pears
a &s;ort of vulgar virtue, requi&s;ite chief|ly
in the petty tran&s;actions, which tho&s;e of
inferior &s;tation carry on with one another.
But humanity and liberality, they con&s;ider
as more refined virtues, which dignify their
character, and cover all their failings. They
can relent at repre&s;entations of di&s;tre&s;s; can
be&s;tow with o&s;tentatious genero&s;ity; can
even occa&s;ionally &s;hare their wealth with a
<PB N="359" REF="372">
companion of whom they are fond; while,
at the &s;ame time, they with-hold from
others what is due to them; are negligent
of their family and their relations; and to
the ju&s;t demands of their creditors give no
attention.</P>
<P>Both the&s;e cla&s;&s;es of men run to a faulty
extreme. They divide moral virtue be|tween
them. Each takes that part of it
only, which &s;uits his temper. Without ju|&s;tice,
there is no virtue. But without hu|manity
and mercy, no virtuous character
is complete. The one man leans to the ex|treme
of par&s;imony. The other, to that of
profu&s;ion. The temper of the one is un|feeling.
The &s;en&s;ibility of the other is
thoughtle&s;s. The one you may in &s;ome
degree re&s;pect; but you cannot love. The
other may be loved; but cannot be re|&s;pected:
and it is difficult to &s;ay, which
character is mo&s;t defective.&mdash;We mu&s;t un|doubtedly
begin with being ju&s;t, before we
attempt to be generous. At the &s;ame time,
he who goes no farther than bare ju&s;tice,
&s;tops at the beginning of virtue. We are
<PB N="360" REF="373">
commanded to <HI>do ju&s;tly;</HI> but, to <HI>love mercy.</HI>
The one virtue, regulates our actions. The
other, improves our heart and affections.
Each is equally nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s
of the world. Ju&s;tice is the pillar, that
upholds the whole fabric of human &s;ociety.
Mercy is the genial ray, which chears and
warms the habitations of men. The per|fection
of our &s;ocial character con&s;i&s;ts, in
properly tempering the two with one an|other;
in holding that middle cour&s;e,
which admits of our being ju&s;t, without
being rigid; and allows us to be generous,
without being unju&s;t.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t next guard again&s;t either too
great &s;everity, or too great facility of man|ners.
The&s;e are extremes, of which we
every day behold in&s;tances in the world.
He who leans to the &s;ide of &s;everity, is
har&s;h in his cen&s;ures, and narrow in his
opinions. He cannot conde&s;cend to others
in things indifferent. He has no allowance
to make for human frailty; or for the dif|ference
of age, rank, or temper, among
<PB N="361" REF="374">
mankind. With him, all gaiety is &s;inful
levity; and every amu&s;ement is a crime.
To this extreme, the admonition of Solo|mon
may be under&s;tood to belong; <HI>Be not
righteous over much; neither make thy&s;elf over
wife. Why &s;hould&s;t thou de&s;troy thy&s;elf</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. vii. 16.</NOTE>?
When this &s;everity of manners is hypocri|tical,
and a&s;&s;umed as a cloak to &s;ecret in|dulgence,
it is one of the wor&s;t pro&s;titu|tions
of religion. But I now con&s;ider it,
not as the effect of de&s;ign, but of natural
au&s;terity of temper, and of contracted ma|xims
of conduct. Its influence upon the
per&s;on him&s;elf, is to render him gloomy
and four; upon others, to alienate them
both from his &s;ociety, and his coun&s;els;
upon religion, to &s;et it forth as a moro&s;e
and forbidding principle.&mdash;The oppo&s;ite
extreme to this is, perhaps, &s;till more dan|gerous;
that of too great facility, and ac|commodation
to the ways of others. The
man of this character, partly from indolent
weakne&s;s, and partly from &s;oftne&s;s of tem|per,
<PB N="362" REF="375">
is di&s;po&s;ed to a tame and univer&s;al a&s;|&s;ent.
Aver&s;e either to contradict or to
blame, he goes along with the manners that
prevail. He views every character with in|dulgent
eye; and with good di&s;po&s;itions in
his brea&s;t, and a natural reluctance to pro|fligacy
and vice, he is enticed to the com|mi&s;&s;ion
of evils which he condemns, mere|ly
through want of fortitude to oppo&s;e
others.</P>
<P>Nothing, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed in moral
conduct, is more difficult, than to avoid
turning here, either <HI>to the right hand or to
the left.</HI> One of the greate&s;t trials both of
wi&s;dom and virtue is, to pre&s;erve a ju&s;t
medium, between that har&s;hne&s;s of au&s;te|rity,
which di&s;gu&s;ts and alienates mankind,
and that weakne&s;s of good-nature, which
opens the door to &s;inful exce&s;s. The one
&s;eparates us too much from the world. The
other connects us too clo&s;ely with it; and
&s;educes us to <HI>follow the multitude in doing
evil.</HI> One who is of the former character,
&s;tudies too little to be agreeable, in order to
render him&s;elf u&s;eful. He who is of the
<PB N="363" REF="376">
latter, by &s;tudying too much to be agree|able,
forfeits his innocence. If the one
hurt religion, by cloathing it in the garb
of unnece&s;&s;ary &s;trictne&s;s; the other, by un|warrantable
compliance, &s;trengthens the
power of corruption in the world. The
one borders on the character of the Pha|ri&s;ee;
the other, on that of the Sadducee.
True religion enjoins us to &s;tand at an
equal di&s;tance from both; and to pur&s;ue
the difficult, but honourable aim, of uni|ting
good nature with fixed religious principle;
affable manners, with untainted vir|tue.</P>
<P>FARTHER; we run to one extreme, when
we contemn altogether the opinions of man|kind;
to another, when we court their
prai&s;e too eagerly. The former di&s;covers
a high degree of pride and &s;elf-conceit.
The latter betrays &s;ervility of &s;pirit. We
are formed by nature and Providence, to be
connected with one another. No man can
&s;tand entirely alone, and independent of
his fellow-creatures. A rea&s;onable re|gard,
<PB N="364" REF="377">
therefore, for their e&s;teem and good
opinion, is a commendable principle. It
flows from humanity; and coincides with,
the de&s;ire of being mutually u&s;eful. But,
if that regard be carried too far, it becomes
the &s;ource of much corruption. For in the
pre&s;ent &s;tate of mankind, the prai&s;e of the
world often interferes with our acting that
&s;teady and con&s;cientious part, which gains
the approbation of God. Hence ari&s;es the
difficulty of drawing a proper line, between
the allowable regard for reputation, and
the exce&s;&s;ive de&s;ire of prai&s;e. On the one
&s;ide, and on the other, dangers meet us; and
either extreme will be pernicious to virtue.</P>
<P>He who extingui&s;hes all regard to the
&s;entiments of mankind, &s;uppre&s;&s;es one in|centive
to honourable deeds; nay, he re|moves
one of the &s;tronge&s;t checks on vice.
For, where there is no de&s;ire of prai&s;e,
there will be al&s;o no &s;en&s;e of reproach and
&s;hame; and when this &s;en&s;e is de&s;troyed,
the way is paved to open profligacy. On
the other hand, he who is actuated &s;olely
by the love of human prai&s;e, incroaches on
<PB N="365" REF="378">
the higher re&s;pect which he owes to con|&s;cience,
and to God. Hence, virtue is
often counterfeited; and many a &s;plen|did
appearance has been exhibited to the
world, which had no ba&s;is in real prin|ciple,
or inward affection. Hence, reli|gious
truths have been di&s;gui&s;ed, or un|fairly
repre&s;ented, in order to be &s;uited
to popular ta&s;te. Hence the Scribes and
Phari&s;ees rejected our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, <HI>becau&s;e
they loved the prai&s;e of men more than the
prai&s;e of God.</HI>&mdash;Turn, therefore, neither to
<HI>the right hand, nor to the left.</HI> Affect not to
de&s;pi&s;e what the world thinks of your con|duct
and character; and yet, let not the
&s;entiments of the world entirely rule you.
Let a de&s;ire of e&s;teem be one motive of
your conduct; but let it hold a &s;ubordi|nate
place. Mea&s;ure the regard that is due
to the opinions of men, by the degree in
which the&s;e coincide with the law of God.</P>
<P>ALLOW me next to &s;ugge&s;t, the danger
of running to the extreme of anxiety about
worldly intere&s;ts on the one hand, and of
<PB N="366" REF="379">
negligence on the other. It is hard to &s;ay
which of the&s;e extremes is fraught with
mo&s;t vice, and mo&s;t mi&s;ery. Indu&s;try and
diligence are unque&s;tionable duties, &s;trict|ly
enforced on all Chri&s;tians; and he who
fails in making &s;uitable provi&s;ion for his
hou&s;ehold and family, is pronounced to be
<HI>wor&s;e than an infidel.</HI> But there are bounds,
within which our concern for worldly &s;uc|ce&s;s
mu&s;t be confined. For anxiety is the
certain poi&s;on of human life. It deba&s;es
the mind; and &s;harpens all the pa&s;&s;ions.
It involves men in perpetual di&s;tractions,
and tormenting cares; and leads them a&s;ide
from what ought to be the great &s;cope of
human action. Anxiety is, in general, the
effect of a covetous temper. Negligence is
commonly, the offspring of licentiou&s;ne&s;s,
and always, the parent of univer&s;al di&s;or|der.
By anxiety, you render your&s;elves
mi&s;erable. By negligence, you too often
occa&s;ion the ruin of others. The anxious
man is the votary of riches; the negligent
man, the votary of plea&s;ure. Each offers
his mi&s;taken wor&s;hip, at the &s;hrine of a
<PB N="367" REF="380">
fal&s;e deity; and each &s;hall reap only &s;uch
rewards as an idol can be&s;tow; the one &s;a|crificing
the enjoyment and improvement
of the pre&s;ent, to vain cares about futuri|ty;
the other &s;o totally taken up in enjoying
the pre&s;ent, as to &s;tore the future with cer|tain
mi&s;eries.&mdash;True virtue holds a tem|perate
cour&s;e between the&s;e extremes; nei|ther
carele&s;s of to-morrow, nor taking too
much thought for it; diligent, but not
anxious; prudent, but not covetous; at|tentive
to provide comfortable accommo|dation
on earth, but chiefly concerned to
<HI>lay up trea&s;ures in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall only warn you farther again&s;t the
extreme, of engaging in a cour&s;e of life too
bu&s;y and hurried, or of devoting your|&s;elves
to one too retired and unemployed.
We are formed for a mixture of action,
and retreat. Our connections with &s;ociety,
and the performance of the duties which we
owe to one another, nece&s;&s;arily engage us
in active life. What we owe to our&s;elves,
requires occa&s;ional retirement. For he who
<PB N="368" REF="381">
lives always in the bu&s;tle of the world can|not,
it is to be feared, always pre&s;erve his
virtue pure. Sentiments of piety will be
deprived of that nouri&s;hment and &s;upport,
which they would derive from meditation
and devotion. His temper will be often
ruffled and di&s;turbed. His pa&s;&s;ions will be
kept too much on the &s;tretch. From the
contagious manners which every where a|bound,
he will not be able to avoid con|tracting
&s;ome dangerous infection.&mdash;On
the other hand, he who flies to total retreat,
in order either to enjoy ea&s;e, or to e&s;cape
from the temptations of the world, will of|ten
find di&s;quiet meeting him in &s;olitude,
and the wor&s;t temptations ari&s;ing from
within him&s;elf. Unoccupied by active and
honourable pur&s;uits, unable to devote his
whole time to improving thoughts, many
an evil pa&s;&s;ion will &s;tart up, and occupy the
vacant hour. Sullenne&s;s and gloom will be
in danger of overwhelming him. Peevi&s;h
di&s;plea&s;ure, and &s;u&s;picions of mankind, are
apt to per&s;ecute tho&s;e who withdraw them|&s;elves
altogether from the haunts of men.
<PB N="369" REF="382">
&mdash;Steer therefore a middle cour&s;e, be|tween
a life oppre&s;&s;ed with bu&s;ine&s;s on the
one hand; and burdened, for the burden
is no le&s;s, with idlene&s;s on the other. Pro|vide
for your&s;elves matter of fair and ho|ne&s;t
pur&s;uit, to afford a proper object to
the active powers of the mind. Temper
bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;erious meditation; and en|liven
retreat by returns of action and in|du&s;try.</P>
<P>THUS I have pointed out &s;ome of tho&s;e
extremes into which men are apt to run,
by for&s;aking the line which religion and
wi&s;dom have drawn. Many more, I am
&s;en&s;ible, might be &s;ugge&s;ted; for the field
is wide, and hardly is there any appearance
of piety, virtue, or good conduct, but what
the folly of men is apt to pu&s;h into undue
exce&s;s, on one or other &s;ide. What I have
mentioned, will be &s;ufficient to &s;how the
nece&s;&s;ity of prudent circum&s;pection, in or|der
to e&s;cape the dangers which be&s;et us in
this &s;tate of trial. Let us &s;tudy to attain
a regular, uniform, con&s;i&s;tent character;
<PB N="370" REF="383">
where nothing that is exce&s;&s;ive or di&s;pro|portioned
&s;hall come forward to view;
which &s;hall not plume it&s;elf with a fair
&s;how on one &s;ide only, while in other quar|ters
it remains unadorned, and blemi&s;hed;
but, where the different parts of worth and
goodne&s;s &s;hall appear united, and each &s;hall
exert its proper influence on conduct.
Thus, <HI>turning neither to the right hand nor to
the left,</HI> we &s;hall, as far as our frailty per|mits,
approach to the perfection of the hu|man
character; and &s;hall have rea&s;on <HI>not
to be a&s;hamed when we have</HI> equal <HI>re&s;pect to
all God's commandments.</HI></P>

<Q>&mdash;There &s;hall come in the la&s;t days Scoffers.&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS the Chri&s;tian religion is adver&s;e to the
inclinations and pa&s;&s;ions of the corrupt|ed
part of mankind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XVIII.</NOTE> it has been its fate, in eve|ry
age, to encounter the oppo&s;ition of various
foes. Sometimes, it has undergone the &s;torms
of violence and per&s;ecution. Sometimes, it
has been attacked by the arms of fal&s;e
rea&s;oning, and &s;ophi&s;try. When the&s;e have
failed of &s;ucce&s;s, it has at other times been
expo&s;ed to the &s;coffs of the petulant. Men
of light and frivolous minds, who had no
comprehen&s;ion of thought for di&s;cerning
<PB N="372" REF="385">
what is great, and no &s;olidity of judge|ment
for deciding on what is true, have
taken upon them to treat religion with con|tempt,
as if it were of no con&s;equence to
the world. They have affected to repre&s;ent
the whole of that venerable fabric, which
has &s;o long commanded the re&s;pect of man|kind;
which, for ages, the learned have
&s;upported, and the wi&s;e have admired, as
having no better foundation than the
gloomy imagination of fanatics and vi&s;io|naries.
Of this character were tho&s;e <HI>&s;cof|fers,</HI>
predicted by the Apo&s;tle to ari&s;e <HI>in the
la&s;t days;</HI> a prediction which we have &s;een
too often fulfilled. As the fal&s;e colours
which &s;uch men throw on religion, are apt
to impo&s;e on the weak and unwary, let us
now examine, whether religion affords any
ju&s;t grounds for the contempt or ridicule
of the &s;coffer. They mu&s;t be either the
doctrines, or the precepts of religion, which
he endeavours to hold forth to contempt.</P>
<P>THE doctrines of the Chri&s;tian religion
are rational and pure. All that it has re|vealed
<PB N="373" REF="386">
concerning the perfections of God,
his moral government and laws, the de&s;ti|nation
of man, and the rewards and pu|ni&s;hments
of a future &s;tate, is perfectly con|&s;onant
to the mo&s;t enlightened rea&s;on. In
&s;ome articles which tran&s;cend the limits of
our pre&s;ent faculties, as in what relates to
the e&s;&s;ence of the Godhead, the fallen &s;tate
of mankind, and their redemption by Je&s;us
Chri&s;t, its doctrines may appear my&s;terious
and dark. Again&s;t the&s;e, the &s;coffer has of|ten
directed his attacks; as if whatever could
not be explained by us, ought upon that
account to be exploded as ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to enter, at pre&s;ent, on any
particular defence of the&s;e doctrines, as there
is one ob&s;ervation which, if duly weighed,
is &s;ufficient to &s;ilence the cavils of the &s;cof|fer.
Is he not compelled to admit, that the
whole &s;y&s;tem of nature around him is full
of my&s;tery? What rea&s;on, then, had he to
&s;uppose, that the doctrines of revelation,
proceeding from the &s;ame author, were to
contain no my&s;terious ob&s;curity? All that
is requi&s;ite for the conduct of life, both in
<PB N="374" REF="387">
nature and in religion, divine wi&s;dom has
rendered obvious to all. As nature has af|forded
us &s;ufficient information concerning
what is nece&s;&s;ary for our food, our accom|modation,
and our &s;afety; &s;o religion has
plainly in&s;tructed us in our duty towards
God, and our neighbour. But as &s;oon as
we attempt to ri&s;e towards objects that lie
beyond our immediate &s;phere of action,
our curio&s;ity is checked; and darkne&s;s meets
us on every &s;ide. What the e&s;&s;ence is of
tho&s;e material bodies which we &s;ee and
handle; how a &s;eed grows up into a tree;
how man is formed in the womb; or how
the mind acts upon the body, after it is
formed; are my&s;teries of which we can give
no more account, than of the mo&s;t ob&s;cure
and difficult parts of revelation. We are
obliged to admit the exi&s;tence of the fact,
though the explanation of it exceeds our fa|culties.</P>
<P>After the &s;ame manner, in natural reli|gion,
que&s;tions ari&s;e concerning the crea|tion
of the world from nothing, the origin
of evil under the government of a perfect
<PB N="375" REF="388">
Being, and the con&s;i&s;tency of human liber|ty
with divine pre&s;cience, which are of as
intricate nature, and of as difficult &s;olution,
as any que&s;tions in Chri&s;tian theology. We
may plainly &s;ee, that we are not admitted
into the &s;ecrets of Providence, any more
than into the my&s;teries of the Godhead. In
all his ways, the Almighty is a <HI>God that
hideth him&s;elf. He maketh darkne&s;s his pavi|lion.
He holdeth back the face of his throne;
and &s;preadeth a thick cloud upon it.</HI>&mdash;In|&s;tead
of its being any objection to revela|tion,
that &s;ome of its doctrines are my&s;te|rious,
it would be much more &s;trange and
unaccountable, if no &s;uch doctrines were
found in it. Had every thing in the Chri|&s;tian
&s;y&s;tem been perfectly level to our ca|pacities,
this might rather have given ground
to a &s;u&s;picion, of its not proceeding from
God; &s;ince it would have been then &s;o un|like
to what we find, both in the &s;y&s;tem
of the univer&s;e, and in the &s;y&s;tem of natu|ral
religion. Whereas, according as mat|ters
now &s;tand, the go&s;pel has the &s;ame fea|tures,
the &s;ame general character, with the
<PB N="376" REF="389">
other two, which are acknowledged to be of
divine origin; plain and comprehen&s;ible, in
what relates to practice; dark and my&s;te|rious,
in what relates to &s;peculation and be|lief<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See this argument fully pur&s;ued, and placed in a &s;trong light, by the ma&s;terly hand of Bi&s;hop Butler, in his <HI>Analogy of Natural and Revealed Religion.</HI></NOTE>.
The cavils of the &s;coffer, therefore,
on this head, are &s;o far from having any
ju&s;t foundation, that they only di&s;cover
his ignorance, and the narrowne&s;s of his
views.</P>
<P>LET us next proceed to what relates to
practice, or the preceptive part of religion.
&mdash;The duties which religion enjoins us to
perform towards God, are tho&s;e which have
oftene&s;t furni&s;hed matter to the &s;coffs of
the licentious. They attempt to repre&s;ent
the&s;e as &s;o idle and &s;uperfluous, that they
could owe their birth to nothing but en|thu&s;ia&s;m.
&mdash;For, is not the Deity &s;o far ex|alted
above us, as to receive neither advan|tage
nor plea&s;ure, from our wor&s;hip? What
are our prayers, or our prai&s;es, to that infinite
<PB N="377" REF="390">
mind, who, re&s;ting in the full enjoyment
of his own beatitude, beholds all his crea|tures
pa&s;&s;ing before him, only as the in&s;ects
of a day? What but &s;uper&s;titious terrors,
could have dictated tho&s;e forms of homage,
and tho&s;e di&s;tinctions of &s;acred days, in
which vulgar minds delight, but which the
liberal and enlarged look upon with &s;corn?</P>
<P>Now, in return to &s;uch in&s;ults of the
&s;coffer, it might be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve,
that the united &s;entiments of mankind, in
every age and nation, are again&s;t him.
Thoughtle&s;s as the bulk of men are, and
attached only to objects which they &s;ee a|round
them; this principle has never been
extingui&s;hed in their brea&s;ts, that to the
great Parent of the human race, the uni|ver&s;al,
though invi&s;ible, benefactor of the
world, not only internal reverence, but ex|ternal
homage is due. Whether he need
that homage or not, is not the que&s;tion. It
is what, on our part, we undoubtedly owe;
and the heart is, with rea&s;on, held to be
ba&s;e, which &s;tifles the emotions of grati|tude
to a benefactor, how independent &s;o|ever
<PB N="378" REF="391">
ever he may be of any returns. True vir|tue,
always prompts a public declaration of
the grateful &s;entiments which it feels; and
glories in expre&s;&s;ing them. Accordingly,
over all the earth, crowds of wor&s;hippers
have a&s;&s;embled to adore, in various forms,
the Ruler of the world. In the&s;e adorations,
the philo&s;opher, the &s;avage, and the &s;aint,
have, equally joined. None but the cold
and unfeeling can look up to that benefi|cent
Being, who is at the head of the uni|ver&s;e,
without &s;ome inclination to pray, or
to prai&s;e. In vain, therefore, would the
&s;coffer deride, what the loud voice of na|ture
demands and ju&s;tifies. He erects him|&s;elf
again&s;t the general, and declared &s;en&s;e
of the human race.</P>
<P>But apart from this consideration, I mu&s;t
call on him to attend to one of a &s;till more
&s;erious and awful nature. By his licentious
ridicule of the duties of piety, and of the
institutions of divine wor&s;hip, he is weak|ening
the power of con&s;cience over men;
he it undermining the great pillars of &s;o|ciety;
he is giving a mortal blow to public
<PB N="379" REF="392">
order, and public happine&s;s. All the&s;e re&s;t
on nothing &s;o much, as on the general be|lief
of an all-&s;eeing witne&s;s, and the gene|ral
veneration of an Almighty Governor.
On this belief, and this veneration, is founded
the whole obligation of an oath; with|out
which, government could not be admi|ni&s;tered,
nor courts of ju&s;tice act; contro|ver&s;ies
could not be determined, nor private
property be pre&s;erved &s;afe. Our only &s;e|curity
again&s;t innumerable crimes, to
which the re&s;traints of human laws cannot
reach, is the dread of an invi&s;ible avenger,
and of tho&s;e future puni&s;hments which
he hath prepared for the guilty. Remove this
dread from the minds of men; and you
&s;trengthen the hands of the wicked, and
endanger the &s;afety of human &s;ociety.</P>
<P>But how could impre&s;&s;ions &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to
the public welfare be pre&s;erved, if there were
no religious a&s;&s;emblies, no &s;acred in&s;titu|tions,
no days &s;et apart for divine wor&s;hip,
in order to be &s;olemn remembrancers to
men of the exi&s;tence, and the dominion of
God; and of the future account they have
<PB N="380" REF="393">
to give of their actions to him? To all ranks
of men, the &s;entiments which public reli|gion
tends to awaken, are &s;alutary and be|neficial.
But with re&s;pect to the inferior
cla&s;&s;es, it is well known, that the only prin|ciples
which re&s;train them from evil, are
acquired in the religious a&s;&s;emblies which
they frequent. De&s;titute of the advantages
of regular education; ignorant, in great
mea&s;ure, of public laws; unacquainted
with tho&s;e refined ideas of honour and pro|priety,
to which others of more knowledge
have been trained; were tho&s;e &s;acred tem|ples
de&s;erted to which they now re&s;ort,
they would be in danger of degenerating
into a ferocious race, from whom lawle&s;s
violence was perpetually to be dreaded.</P>
<P>He, therefore, who treats &s;acred things
with any degree of levity and &s;corn, is ac|ting
the part, perhaps without his &s;eeing or
knowing it, of a public enemy to &s;ociety.
He is preci&s;ely the <HI>madman</HI> described in the
book of Proverbs,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxvi. 18.</NOTE> <HI>who ca&s;teth firebrands,
<PB N="381" REF="394">
arrows, and death; and &s;aith, am I not in
&s;port?</HI> We &s;hall hear him, at times, com|plain
loudly of the undutifulne&s;s of chil|dren,
of the di&s;hone&s;ty of &s;ervants, of the
tumults and in&s;olence of the lower ranks;
while he him&s;elf is, in a great mea&s;ure,
re&s;pon&s;ible for the di&s;orders of which he
complains. By the example which he &s;ets
of contempt for religion, he becomes ac|ce&s;&s;ory
to the manifold crimes, which that
contempt occa&s;ions among others. By his
&s;coffing at &s;acred in&s;titutions, he is encou|raging
the rabble to uproar and violence;
he is emboldening the fal&s;e witne&s;s to take
the name of God in vain; he is, in effect,
putting arms into the hands of the high|wayman,
and letting loo&s;e the robber on
the &s;treets by night.</P>
<P>We come next to con&s;ider that great
cla&s;s of duties, which re&s;pect our conduct
towards our fellow-creatures. The ab&s;olute
nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e to general welfare is &s;o
apparent, as to have &s;ecured them, in a
great degree, from the attacks of the &s;cof|fer
<PB N="382" REF="395">
He who &s;hould attempt to turn ju|&s;tice,
truth, or hone&s;ty, into ridicule, would
be avoided by every one. To tho&s;e who
had any remains of principle, he would be
odious. To tho&s;e who attended only to
their intere&s;t, he would appear a dangerous
man. But though the &s;ocial virtues are
treated in general as re&s;pectable and &s;acred,
there are certain forms and degrees of them,
which have not been exempted from the
&s;corn of the unthinking. That exten&s;ive
genero&s;ity, and high public &s;pirit, which
prompt a man to &s;acrifice his own intere&s;t,
in order to promote &s;ome great general
good; and that &s;trict and &s;crupulous inte|grity,
which will not allow one, on any
occa&s;ion, to depart from the truth; have
often been treated with contempt by tho&s;e
who are called men of the world. They
who will not &s;toop to flatter the great; who
di&s;dain to comply with prevailing manners,
when they judge them to be evil; who re|fu&s;e
to take the &s;malle&s;t advantage of others,
in order to procure the greate&s;t benefit for
them&s;elves; are repre&s;ented as per&s;ons of
<PB N="383" REF="396">
romantic character, and vi&s;ionary notions,
unacquainted with the world, and unfit
to live in it.</P>
<P>Such per&s;ons are &s;o far from being liable
to any ju&s;t ridicule, that they are intitled
to a degree of re&s;pect, which approaches to
veneration. For they are, in truth, the
great &s;upporters and guardians of public
order. The authority of their character
overawes the giddy multitude. The weight
of their example retards the progre&s;s of cor|ruption;
checks that relaxation of morals,
which is always too apt to gain ground in|&s;en&s;ibly,
and to make incroachments on
every department of &s;ociety. Accordingly,
it is this high genero&s;ity of &s;pirit, this in|flexible
virtue, this regard to principle, &s;u|perior
to all opinion, which has ever mark|ed
the characters of tho&s;e who have emi|nently
di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in public
life; who have patroni&s;ed the cau&s;e of ju|&s;tice
again&s;t powerful oppre&s;&s;ors; who, in
critical times, have &s;upported the falling
rights and liberties of men; and have re|flected
honour on their nation and country.
<PB N="384" REF="397">
Such per&s;ons may have been &s;coffed at by
&s;ome among whom they lived; but po&s;te|rity
has done them ample ju&s;tice; and they
are the per&s;ons, who&s;e names are recorded
to future ages, and who are thought and
&s;poken of with admiration.</P>
<P>The mere temporizer, the man of accom|modating
principles, and inferior virtue,
may &s;upport a plau&s;ible character for a
while among his friends and followers;
but as &s;oon as the hollowne&s;s of his prin|ciples
is detected, he &s;inks into contempt.
They who are prone to deride men of in|flexible
integrity, only betray the littlene&s;s
of their minds. They &s;how that they un|der&s;tand
not the &s;ublime of virtue; that
they have no di&s;cernment of the true ex|cellence
of man. By affecting to throw any di&s;couragement
on purity and &s;trict|ne&s;s
of morals, they not only expo&s;e them|&s;elves
to ju&s;t contempt, but propagate &s;en|timents
very dangerous to &s;ociety. For, if
we loo&s;en the regard due to virtue in any
of its parts, we begin to &s;ap the whole of
it. No man, as it has been often &s;aid, be|comes
<PB N="385" REF="398">
entirely profligate at once. He de|viates,
&s;tep by &s;tep, from con&s;cience. If
the loo&s;e ca&s;ui&s;try of the &s;coffer were to
prevail, open di&s;hone&s;ty, fal&s;ehood, and
treachery, would &s;peedily grow out of tho&s;e
complying principles, tho&s;e relaxations of
virtue, which he would repre&s;ent to be ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for every man who knows the world.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t cla&s;s of virtues I am to men|tion,
are tho&s;e which are of a per&s;onal na|ture,
and which re&s;pect the government to
be exerci&s;ed over our plea&s;ures and pa&s;&s;ions.
Here, the &s;coffer has always con&s;idered
him&s;elf as having an ample field. Often,
and often, have &s;uch virtues as &s;obriety,
temperance, mode&s;ty, and cha&s;tity, been
made the &s;ubject of ridicule, as monki&s;h
habits, which exclude men from the com|pany
of the fa&s;hionable and the gay; ha|bits,
which are the effect of low education,
or of mean &s;pirits, or of mere feeblene&s;s of
con&s;titution; while &s;coffers, <HI>walking,</HI> as it is
too truly &s;aid of them by the Apo&s;tle, <HI>after
<PB N="386" REF="399">
their lu&s;ts,</HI> boa&s;t of their own manners as
liberal and free, as manly and &s;pirited.
They fancy them&s;elves rai&s;ed thereby much
above the crowd; and hold all tho&s;e in con|tempt,
who confine them&s;elves within the
vulgar bounds of regular and orderly life.</P>
<P>Infatuated men! who &s;ee not that the
virtues of which they make &s;port, not
only derive their authority from the laws of
God, but are moreover e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite
both to public, and to private happine&s;s.
By the indulgence of their licentious plea|&s;ures

may be obtained. But what are the con&s;e|quences?
Suppo&s;e any individual to per|&s;evere
unre&s;trained in this cour&s;e, it is cer|tainly
to be followed, by di&s;repute in his
character, and di&s;order in his affairs; by a
wa&s;ted and broken con&s;titution; and a
&s;peedy and mi&s;erable old age. Suppo&s;e a
&s;ociety to be wholly formed of &s;uch per&s;ons
as the &s;coffers applaud; &s;uppo&s;e it to be
filled with none but tho&s;e whom they call
the &s;ons of plea&s;ure; that is, with the in|temperate,
<PB N="387" REF="400">
the riotous, and di&s;&s;olute, among
whom all regard to &s;obriety, decency, and
private virtue, was aboli&s;hed; what an odious
&s;cene would &s;uch a &s;ociety exhibit? How
unlike any civili&s;ed or well-ordered &s;tate,
in which mankind have cho&s;en to dwell?
What turbulence and uproar, what conte&s;ts
and quarrels, would perpetually reign in
it? What man of common under&s;tanding
would not rather chu&s;e to dwell in a de|&s;ert,
than to be a&s;&s;ociated for life with &s;uch
companions? Shall, then, the &s;coffer pre|&s;ume
to make light of tho&s;e virtues, with|out
which there could be neither peace,
nor comfort, nor good order, among man|kind?</P>
<P>Let him be de&s;ired to think, of his do|me&s;tic
&s;ituation and connections. Is he a
father, a hu&s;band, or a brother? Has he
any friend or relation, male or female, in
who&s;e happine&s;s he is intere&s;ted?&mdash;Let
us put the que&s;tion to him, whether he be
willing that intemperance, uncha&s;tity, or
di&s;&s;ipation, of any kind, &s;hould mark their
character? Would he recommend to them
<PB N="388" REF="401">
&s;uch exce&s;&s;es? Would he chu&s;e, in their
pre&s;ence, openly, and without di&s;gui&s;e, to
&s;coff at the oppo&s;ite virtues, as of no con|&s;equences
to their welfare?&mdash;If even the
mo&s;t licentious &s;hudders at the thought;
if, in the mid&s;t of is loo&s;e plea&s;ures, he
be de&s;irous that his own family &s;hould re|main
untainted; let this teach him the va|lue
of tho&s;e private virtues, which, in the
hours of di&s;&s;ipation, in the giddine&s;s of his
mind, he is ready to contemn. Bani&s;h &s;o|briety,
temperance, and purity, and you
tear up the foundations of all public order,
and all dome&s;tic quiet. You render every
hou&s;e a divided and mi&s;erable abode, re|&s;ounding
with terms of &s;hame, and mutual
reproaches of infamy. You leave nothing
re&s;pectable in the human character. you
change the man into a brute.</P>
<P>THE conclu&s;ion from all the rea&s;onings
which we have now pur&s;ued, is, that reli|gion
and virtue, in all their forms, either
of doctrine or of precept; of piety towards
God, integrity towards men, or regularity
<PB N="389" REF="402">
in private conduct; are &s;o far from afford|ing
any grounds of ridicule to the petulant,
that they are intitled to our highe&s;t vene|ration;
they are names, which &s;hould ne|ver
be mentioned, but with the utmo&s;t ho|nour.
It is &s;aid in Scripture, <HI>Fools make a
mock at &s;in.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiv. 9.</NOTE> They had better make a
mock at pe&s;tilence, at war, of famine.
With one, who &s;hould chu&s;e the&s;e public
calamities for the &s;ubject of his &s;port, you
would not be inclined to a&s;&s;ociate. You
would fly from him, as wor&s;e than a fool;
as a man of di&s;tempered mind, from whom
you might be in hazard of receiving a &s;ud|den
blow. Yet certain it is, that, to the
great &s;ociety of mankind, &s;in is a greater
calamity, than either pe&s;tilence, of famine,
or war. The&s;e operate, only as occa&s;ional
cau&s;es of mi&s;ery. But the &s;ins and vices
of men, are perpetual &s;courges of the world.
Impiety and inju&s;tice, fraud and fal&s;ehood,
imtemperance and profligacy, are daily pro|ducing
mi&s;chief and di&s;order; bringing
<PB N="390" REF="403">
ruin on individuals; tearing families and
communities in pieces; giving ri&s;e to a
thou&s;and tragical &s;cenes on this unhappy
theatre. In proportion as manners are vi|cious,
mankind are unhappy. The per|fection
of virtue which reigns in the world
above, is the chief &s;ource of the perfect
ble&s;&s;edne&s;s which prevails there.</P>
<P>When, therefore, we ob&s;erve any tenden|cy
to treat religion or morals with di&s;re|&s;pect
and levity, let us hold it to be a &s;ure
indication of a perverted under&s;tanding, or
a depraved heart. <HI>In the &s;eat of the &s;corner</HI>
let us never &s;it. Let us account that wit
contaminated, which attempts to &s;port it&s;elf
on &s;acred &s;ubjects. When the &s;coffer ari&s;es,
let us maintain the honour of our God,
and our Redeemer; and re&s;olutely adhere
to the cau&s;e of virtue and goodne&s;s. <HI>The
lips of the wi&s;e utter knowledge; but the mouth
of the fooli&s;h is near to de&s;truction. Him that
honoureth God, God will honour. The fear of
the Lord is the beginning of wi&s;dom: and he
that keepeth the commandment, keepeth his

<P>SUCH in the commencement of the hi&s;|tory
of mankind;<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIX.</NOTE> an aera, to which we
mu&s;t ever look back with &s;olemn awe and
veneration. Before the &s;un and the moon
had begun their cour&s;e; before the &s;ound
of the human voice was heard, or the
name of man was known; <HI>in the beginning
God created the heaven, and the earth.</HI>&mdash;
To a beginning of the world, we are led
back by every thing that now exi&s;ts; by
all hi&s;tory, all records, all monuments of
<PB N="392" REF="405">
antiquity. In tracing the tran&s;actions of
pa&s;t ages, we arrive at a period, which clear|ly
indicates the infancy of the human race.
We behold the world peopled by degrees.
We a&s;cend to the origin of all tho&s;e u&s;eful
and nece&s;&s;ary arts, without the knowledge
of which, mankind could hardly &s;ub&s;i&s;t.
We di&s;cern &s;ociety and civilization ari&s;ing
from rude beginnings, in every corner of
the earth; and gradually advancing to the
&s;tate in which we now find them: All
which afford plain evidence, that there was
a period, when mankind began to inhabit
and cultivate the earth. What is every re|markable,
the mo&s;t authentic chronology
and hi&s;tory of mo&s;t nations, coincides with
the account of Scripture; and makes the
period during which the world has been
inhabited by the race of men, not to ex|tend
beyond &s;ix thou&s;and years.</P>
<P>To the ancient philo&s;ophers, creation
from nothing appeared an unintelligible
idea. They maintained the eternal exi&s;t|ence
of matter, which they &s;uppo&s;ed to be
modeled by the &s;overeign mind of the uni|ver&s;e,
<PB N="393" REF="406">
into the form which the earth now
exhibits. But there is nothing in this opi|nion
which gives it any title to be oppo&s;ed
to the authority of revelation. The doc|trine
of two &s;elf-exi&s;tent, independent prin|ciples,
God and matter, the one active, the
other pa&s;&s;ive, is a hypothe&s;is which pre&s;ents
difficulties to human rea&s;on, at lea&s;t as
great as the creation of matter from no|thing.
Adhering then to the te&s;timony of
Scripture, we believe, that <HI>in the beginning
God created,</HI> or from non-exi&s;tence brought
into being, <HI>the heaven and the earth.</HI></P>
<P>But though there was a period when this
globe, with all that we &s;ee upon it, did not
exi&s;t, we have no rea&s;on to think, that the
wi&s;dom and power of the Almighty were
then without exerci&s;e of employment.
Boundle&s;s is the extent of his dominion.
Other globes and worlds, enlightened by
other &s;uns, may then have occupied, as
they &s;till appear to occupy, the immen&s;e
regions of &s;pace. Numberle&s;s orders of be|ings,
to us unknown, people the wide ex|tent
of the univer&s;e; and afford an endle&s;s
<PB N="394" REF="407">
variety of objects to the ruling care of the
great Father of all. At length, in the
cour&s;e and progre&s;s of his government,
there arrived a period, when this earth was
to be called into exi&s;tence. When the &s;ig|nal
moment, prede&s;tined from all eternity,
was come, the Deity aro&s;e in his might;
and with a world created the world.&mdash;
What an illu&s;trious moment was that,
when, from non-exi&s;tence, there &s;prang at
once into being, this mighty globe, on
which &s;o many millions of creatures now
dwell!&mdash;No preparatory mea&s;ures were re|quired.
No long circuit of means was em|ployed.
<HI>He &s;pake; and it was done: He
commanded; and it &s;tood fa&s;t.</HI> The earth
was at fir&s;t, <HI>without form, and void; and
darkne&s;s was on the face of the deep.</HI> The Al|mighty
&s;urveyed the dark aby&s;s; and fix|ed
bounds to the &s;everal divi&s;ions of na|ture.
He &s;aid, <HI>Let there be light; and there
was light.</HI> Then appeared the &s;ea, and the
dry land. The mountains ro&s;e; and the
rivers flowed. The &s;un and moon began
their cour&s;e in the &s;kies. Herbs and plants
<PB N="395" REF="408">
cloathed the ground. The air, the earth,
and the waters, were &s;tored with their re|&s;pective
inhabitants. At la&s;t, man was
made after the image of God. He appear|ed,
walking with countenance erect; and
received his Creator's benediction, as the
Lord of this new world. The Almighty
beheld his work when it was fini&s;hed; and
pronounced it good. Superior beings &s;aw
with wonder this new acce&s;&s;ion to exi&s;tence.
<HI>The morning &s;tars &s;ang together; and all the
&s;ons of God &s;houted for joy.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job xxxviii. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, on this great work of creation, let
us not merely gaze with a&s;toni&s;hment. Let
us con&s;ider how it &s;hould affect our con|duct,
by pre&s;enting the divine perfections
in a light which is at once edifying, and
comforting, to man. It di&s;plays the Crea|tor
as &s;upreme in power, in wi&s;dom, and
in goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>I. An &s;upreme in power. When we con|&s;ider
with how much labour and difficulty
<PB N="396" REF="409">
human power performs its incon&s;iderable
works; what time it co&s;ts to rear them;
and how ea&s;ily, when reared, they are de|&s;troyed;
the very idea of creating power
overwhelms the mind with awe. Let us
look around, and &s;urvey this &s;tupendous
edifice, which we have been admitted to
inhabit. Let us think of the extent of the
different climates and regions of the earth;
of the magnitude of the mountains, and of
the expan&s;e of the ocean. Let us conceive
that immen&s;e globe which contains them,
launched at once from the hand of the Al|mighty;
made to revolve ince&s;&s;antly on its
axis, that it might produce the vici&s;&s;itudes
of day and night; thrown forth, at the
&s;ame time, to run its annual cour&s;e in perpetual
circuit through the heavens; after
&s;uch a meditation, where is the greatne&s;s,
where is the pride of man? Into what total
annihilation do we &s;ink, before an omnipo|tent
Being? Who is not di&s;po&s;ed to exclaim,
<HI>Lord, what is man, that thou are mindful of
him; or the &s;on of man, that thou &s;hould&s;t vi&s;it
him? When compared with thee, all men are
<PB N="397" REF="410">
vanity; their works are nothing.</HI>&mdash;Reve|rence,
and humble adoration, ought &s;pon|taneou&s;ly
to ari&s;e. He who feels no pro|pen&s;ity
to wor&s;hip and adore, is dead to all
&s;en&s;e of grandeur and maje&s;ty; has extin|gui&s;hed
one of the mo&s;t natural feelings of
the human heart. <HI>Know the Lord, that he
is God, we are all his people; the workman|&s;hip
of his hands. Let us wor&s;hip and how
down. Let us kneel before the Lord our
Maker.</HI></P>
<P>Of all titles to legi&s;lation and rule, none
is &s;o evident and direct as that of a Crea|tor.
The conviction is felt in every brea&s;t,
that he who gave us being, hath an ab&s;o|lute
right to regulate our conduct. This
gives a &s;anction to the precepts of God,
which the mo&s;t hardened dare not contro|vert.
When it is a Creator and a Father
that &s;peaks, who would not li&s;ten and
obey? Are ju&s;tice and humanity his de|clared
laws; and &s;hall we, whom but ye|&s;terday
he called from the du&s;t, and whom
to-morrow he can reduce into du&s;t again,
pre&s;ume, in contempt of him, to be unju&s;t
<PB N="398" REF="411">
or inhuman? Are there any little intere&s;ts
of our own which we dare to erect, in op|po&s;ition
to the plea&s;ure of him who made
us? <HI>Fear ye not me, &s;aith the Lord; will ye
not tremble at my pre&s;ence, who have placed
the &s;and for the bound of the &s;ea, by a per|petual
decree, that it cannot pa&s;s it; who
&s;tretch forth my hand over the earth, and none
hindereth?</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, the power of a Crea|tor
is encouraging, as well as awful. While
it enforces duty, it in&s;pires confidence un|der
affliction. It brings to view a relation,
which imports tenderne&s;s and comfort; for
it &s;ugge&s;ts the compa&s;&s;ion of a father. In
the time of trouble, mankind are led by
natural impul&s;e, to fly for aid to Him, who
knows the weakne&s;s of the frame which he
has made; who <HI>remembers we are du&s;t;</HI> and
&s;ees the dangers with which we are envi|roned.
&startq;Iam thine; for thou ha&s;t made
me: For&s;ake not the work of thine own
hands,&endq; is one of the mo&s;t natural ejacula|tions
of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mind.&mdash;How ble&s;|&s;ed
are the virtuous, who can re&s;t under the
<PB N="399" REF="412">
protection of that powerful arm, which
made the earth and the heaven? The om|nipotence
which renders God &s;o awful, is
to them a &s;ource of joy. In the whole com|pa&s;s
of nature, nothing is formidable to
them, who firmly repo&s;e their tru&s;t in the
Creator. To them, every noxious power
can be rendered harmle&s;s; every threaten|ed
evil, if not averted, can be transformed
into good. In the Author of nature, they
find not only the author of their being;
but their protector and defender, the lifter
up of their heads. <HI>Happy</HI> is he that hath the
God of Jacob for his help; who&s;e hope is in
the Lord his God; which made heaven and
earth, the &s;ea, and all that therein is; which
keepeth truth for ever<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm $xlvi. 5. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>II. THE work of creation is the di&s;play of
&s;upreme wi&s;dom. It carries no character
more con&s;picuous than this. If, from the
&s;tructure and mechani&s;m of &s;ome of the mo&s;t
complicated works of human art, we are led
<PB N="400" REF="413">
to high admiration of the wi&s;dom of the
contriver, what a&s;toni&s;hment may fill our
minds, when we think of the &s;tructure of
the univer&s;e! It is not only the &s;tupendous
building it&s;elf, which excites admiration;
but the exqui&s;ite &s;kill, with which the end|le&s;s
variety of its parts are adapted to their
re&s;pective purpo&s;es. In&s;omuch, that the
&s;tudy of nature, which, for ages, has em|ployed
the lives of &s;o many learned men,
and which is &s;till &s;o far from being ex|hau&s;ted,
is no other than the &s;tudy of di|vine
wi&s;dom di&s;played in the creation. The
farther our re&s;earches are carried, more
&s;triking proofs of it every where meet us.
The provi&s;ion made for the con&s;tant regu|larity
of the univer&s;e, in the di&s;po&s;ition of
the heavenly bodies, &s;o that in the cour&s;e
of &s;everal thou&s;and years, nature &s;hould
ever exhibit the &s;ame u&s;eful and grateful
variety, in the returns of light and dark|ne&s;s,
of &s;ummer and winter; and ever fur|ni&s;h
food and habitation to all the animals
that people the earth; mu&s;t be a la&s;ting
theme of wonder to every reflecting mind.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="414">
But they are not only the heavens that
<HI>declare the glory of God, and the firmament
that &s;heweth forth his handy work.</HI> In the mo&s;t
incon&s;iderable, as well as in the mo&s;t il|lu&s;trious
works of the Creator, con&s;ummate
art and de&s;ign appear. There is not a crea|ture
that moves, nor a vegetable that grows,
but, when minutely examined, furni&s;hies
materials of the highe&s;t admiration. The
&s;ame wi&s;dom that placed the &s;un in the
centre of the &s;y&s;tem, and arranged the &s;e|veral
planets around him in their order,
has no le&s;s &s;hown it&s;elf, in the provi&s;ion
made for the food and dwelling of every
bird that roams the air, and every bea&s;t
that wanders in the de&s;ert; equally great,
in the &s;malle&s;t, and in the mo&s;t magnifi|cent
objects; in the &s;tar, and in the infect;
in the elephant, and in the fly; in the beam
that &s;hines from heaven, and in the gra&s;s
that cloaths the ground. Nothing is over|looked.
Nothing is carele&s;sly performed.
Every thing that exi&s;ts, is adapted with per|fect
&s;ymmetry to the end for which it was
de&s;igned. All this infinite variety of par|ticulars
<PB N="402" REF="415">
mu&s;t have been pre&s;ent to the mind
of the Creator; all beheld with one glance
of his eye; all fixed and arranged, from
the beginning in his great de&s;ign, when
he formed the heavens and the earth. Ju&s;t|ly
may we exclaim with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>How
excellent, O Lord, is thy name in all the earth!
How manifold are thy works! In wi&s;dom ha&s;t
thou made them all. No man can find out the
work that God maketh, from the beginning
to the end, Such knowledge is too wonderful
for us. It is high; we cannot attain unto it.</HI></P>
<P>This wi&s;dom di&s;played by the Almighty
in the creation, was not intended merely to
gratify curio&s;ity, and to rai&s;e wonder. It
ought to beget profound &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and
pious tru&s;t, in every heart. It is not un|common
for many who &s;peak with rapture
of creating wi&s;dom, to be guilty, at the &s;ame
time, of arraigning the conduct of Provi|dence.
In the &s;tructure of the univer&s;e,
they confe&s;s that all is goodly and beauti|ful.
But in the government of human af|fairs,
they can &s;ee nothing but di&s;order and
confu&s;ion.&mdash;Have they forgotten, that
<PB N="403" REF="416">
both the one, and the other, proceed from
the &s;ame author? Have they forgotten, that
he who balanced all the heavenly bodies,
and adju&s;ted the proportions and limits of
nature, is the &s;ame who hath allotted them
their condition in the world, who di&s;tri|butes
the mea&s;ures of their pro&s;perity and
adver&s;ity, and fixes <HI>the bounds of their habi|tation?</HI>
If their lot appear to them ill &s;orted,
and their condition hard and unequal, let
them only put the que&s;tion to their own
minds, Whether it be mo&s;t probable, that
the great and wi&s;e Creator hath erred in
his di&s;tribution of human things, or that
they have erred, in the judgement which
they form concerning the lot a&s;&s;igned to
them? Can they believe, that the divine
Arti&s;t, after he had contrived and fini&s;hed
this earth, the habitation of men, with
&s;uch admirable wi&s;dom, would then throw
it out of his hands as a neglected work;
would &s;uffer the affairs of its inhabitants to
proceed by chance; and would behold them
without concern, running into mi&s;rule and
di&s;order? Where were then that con&s;i&s;ten|cy
<PB N="404" REF="417">
of conduct, which we di&s;cover in all the
works of nature, and which we cannot but
a&s;cribe to a perfect Being?&mdash;My brother!
when thy plans are di&s;appointed, and thy
heart is ready to de&s;pair; when virtue is
oppre&s;&s;ed, and the wicked pro&s;per around
thee; in tho&s;e moments of di&s;turbance, look
up to him who created the heaven and the
earth; and confide, that he who made light
to &s;pring from primaeval darkne&s;s, will make
order at la&s;t to ari&s;e from the &s;eeming con|fu&s;ion
of the world.</P>
<P>Had any one beheld the earth in its &s;tate
of chaos; when the elements lay mixed and
confu&s;ed; when the earth <HI>was without form
and void, and darkne&s;s was on the face of the
deep;</HI> would he have believed, that it was
pre&s;ently to become &s;o fair and well order|ed
a globe as we now behold; illumined
with the &s;plendor of the &s;un, and decorated
with all the beauty of nature? The &s;ame
powerful hand, which perfected the work
of creation, &s;hall, in due time, di&s;embroil the
plans of Providence. Of creation, we can
judge more clearly, becau&s;e it &s;tood forth
<PB N="405" REF="418">
at once; it was perfect from the beginning.
But the cour&s;e of Providence is progre&s;&s;ive.
Time is required for the progre&s;&s;ion to ad|vance;
and before it is fini&s;hed, we can
form no judgement, or at lea&s;t a very imper|fect
one, concerning it. We mu&s;t wait un|til
the great aera arrive, when the &s;ecrets of
the univer&s;e &s;hall be unfolded; when the
divine de&s;igns &s;hall be con&s;ummated; when
Providence &s;hall be brought to the &s;ame
completion which creation has already at|tained.
Then, we have every rea&s;on to be|lieve,
that the wi&s;e Creator &s;hall appear in
the end, to have been the wi&s;e and ju&s;t ruler
of the world. Until that period come, let
us be contented and patient; let us &s;ubmit
and adore. <HI>Although thou &s;aye&s;t thou &s;halt
not &s;ee him, yet judgement is before him; there|fore,
tru&s;t thou in him.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job xxxv. 14.</NOTE> This exhortation
will receive more force, when we.</P>
<P>III. Con&s;ider creation as a di&s;play of &s;upreme
goodne&s;s, no le&s;s than of wi&s;dom and
<PB N="406" REF="419">
power. It is the communication of num|berle&s;s
benefits to all who live, together
with exi&s;tence. Ju&s;tly is the earth &s;aid to
be <HI>full of the goodne&s;s of the Lord.</HI> Through|out
the whole &s;y&s;tem of things, we behold
a manife&s;t tendency to promote the benefit
either of the rational, or the animal crea|tion.
In &s;ome parts of nature, this tenden|cy
may be le&s;s obvious than in others. Ob|jects,
which to us &s;eem u&s;ele&s;s, or hurtful,
may &s;ometimes occur; and &s;trange it were,
if in &s;o va&s;t and complicated a &s;y&s;tem, dif|ficulties
of this kind &s;hould not occa&s;ional|ly
pre&s;ent them&s;elves to beings, who&s;e views
are &s;o narrow and limited as ours. It is
well known, that in proportion as the
knowledge of nature has increa&s;ed among
men, the&s;e difficulties have dimini&s;hed. Sa|tisfactory
accounts have been given of ma|ny
perplexing appearances. U&s;eful and
proper purpo&s;es have been found to be pro|moted,
by objects which were, at fir&s;t,
thought unprofitable or noxious.</P>
<P>Malignant mu&s;t be the mind of that per|&s;on;
with a di&s;torted eye he mu&s;t have con|templated
<PB N="407" REF="420">
creation, who can &s;u&s;pect, that
it is not the production of infinite benigni|ty
and goodne&s;s. How many clear marks
of benevolent intention appear, every where
around us? What a profu&s;ion of beauty and
ornament is poured forth on the face of na|ture?
What a magnificent &s;pectacle pre|&s;ented
to the view of man? What &s;upply
contrived for his wants? What a variety of
objects &s;et before him, to gratify his &s;en&s;es,
to employ his under&s;tanding, to entertain
his imagination, to cheer and gladden his
heart? Indeed, the very exi&s;tence of the
univer&s;e is a &s;tanding memorial of the
goodne&s;s of the Creator. For nothing ex|cept
goodne&s;s could originally prompt crea|tion.
The &s;upreme Being, &s;elf-exi&s;tent and
all-&s;ufficient, had no wants which he could
&s;eek to &s;upply. No new acce&s;&s;ion of felici|ty
or glory was to re&s;ult to him, from crea|tures
whom he made. It was goodne&s;s
communicating and pouring it&s;elf forth,
goodne&s;s delighting to impart happine&s;s
in all its forms, which in the beginning
created the heaven and the earth. Hence,
<PB N="408" REF="421">
tho&s;e innumerable orders of living creatures
with which the earth is peopled; from the
lowe&s;t cla&s;s of &s;en&s;itive being, to the high|e&s;t
rank of rea&s;on and intelligence. Where|ever
there is life, there is &s;ome degree of
happine&s;s; there are enjoyments &s;uited to
the different powers of feeling; and earth,
and air, and water, are, with magnificent
liberality, made to teem with life.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e &s;triking di&s;plays of creating
goodne&s;s call forth, on our part, re&s;pon&s;ive
love, gratitude, and veneration. To this
great Father of all exi&s;tence and life, to
Him who hath rai&s;ed us up to behold the
light of day, and to enjoy all the comforts
which his world pre&s;ents, let our hearts
&s;end forth a perpetual hymn of prai&s;e.
Evening and morning let us celebrate Him,
who maketh the morning and the evening
to rejoice over our heads; who <HI>openeth his
hand, and &s;atisfieth the de&s;ire of every living
thing.</HI> Let us rejoice, that we are brought
into a world, which is the production of
infinite goodne&s;s; over which a &s;upreme
intelligence pre&s;ides; and where nothing
<PB N="409" REF="422">
happens, that was not planned and arran|ged
from the beginning, in his decree. Con|vinced
that he hateth not the works which
he hath made, nor hath brought creatures
into exi&s;tence, merely to &s;uffer unnece&s;&s;ary
pain, let us, even in the mid&s;t of &s;orrow,
receive, with calm &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, whatever he
is plea&s;ed to &s;end; thankful for what he
be&s;tows; and &s;atisfied, that, without good
rea&s;on, he takes nothing away.</P>
<P>SUCH, in general, are the effects which
meditation on the creation of the world
ought to produce. It pre&s;ents &s;uch an a&s;to|ni&s;hing
conjunction of power, wi&s;dom, and
goodne&s;s, as cannot be beheld without re|ligious
veneration. Accordingly, among
all nations of the earth, it has given ri&s;e to
religious belief and wor&s;hip. The mo&s;t
ignorant and &s;avage tribes, when they look|ed
round on the earth and the heavens,
could not avoid a&s;cribing their origin to
&s;ome invi&s;ible de&s;igning cau&s;e, and feeling
a propen&s;ity to adore. They are, indeed, the
awful appearances of the Creator's power,
<PB N="410" REF="423">
by which, chiefly, they have been impre&s;&s;ed;
and which have introduced into their
wor&s;hip &s;o many rites of dark &s;uper&s;$$tion.
When the u&s;ual cour&s;e of nature &s;eemed to
be interrupted; when loud thunder rolled
above them in the clouds, or earthquakes
&s;hook the ground, the multitude fell on
their knees, and, with trembling horror,
brought forth the bloody &s;acrifice to ap|pea&s;e
the angry divinity. But it is not in
tho&s;e tremendous appearances of power
merely, that a good and well-in&s;tructed
man beholds the Creator of the world. In
the con&s;tant and regular working of his
hands, in the &s;ilent operations of his wi&s;|dom
and goodne&s;s, ever going on through|out
nature, he delights to contemplate and adore him.</P>
<P>This is one of the chief fruits to be de|rived
from that more perfect knowledge of
the Creator, which is imparted to us by the
Chri&s;tian revelation. Impre&s;&s;ing our minds
with a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of all his attributes, as not
wi&s;e and great only, but as gracious and
merciful let it lead us to view every object
<PB N="411" REF="424">
of calm and undi&s;turbed nature, with a per|petual
reference, to its author. We &s;hall
then behold all the &s;cenes which the hea|vens
and the earth pre&s;ent, with more refi|ned
feelings, and &s;ublimer emotions, than
they who regard them &s;olely as objects of
curio&s;ity, or amu&s;ement. Nature will ap|pear
animated, and enlivened, by the pre|&s;ence
of its author. When the &s;un ri&s;es
or &s;ets in the heavens; when &s;pring paints
the earth, when &s;ummer &s;hines in its glory,
when autumn pours forth its fruits, or
winter returns in its awful forms, we &s;hall
view the Creator manife&s;ting him&s;elf in his
works. We &s;hall meet his pre&s;ence in the
fields. We &s;hall feel his influence in the
cheering beam. We &s;hall hear his voice in
the wind. We &s;hall behold our&s;elves every
where &s;urrounded with the glory of that
univer&s;al &s;pirit, who fills, pervades,
and upholds all. We &s;hall live in the world as
in a great and augu&s;t temple; where the
pre&s;ence of the divinity, who inhabits it,
in&s;pires devotion.</P>
<P>Magnificent as the fabric of the world
<PB N="412" REF="425">
is, it was not, however, intended for per|petual
duration. It was erected as a tem|porary
habitation for a race of beings, who,
after acting there a probationary part, were
to be removed into a higher &s;tate of exi&s;t|ence.
As there was an hour fixed from all
eternity for its creation, &s;o there is an hour
fixed for its di&s;&s;olution; when the heavens
and the earth &s;hall pa&s;s away, and their
place &s;hall know them no more. The con|&s;ideration
of this great event, as the coun|terpart
to the work of creation, &s;hall be the
&s;ubject of the following Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

<P>THESE words pre&s;ent to us an awful
view of the final cata&s;trophe of the
world.<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XX.</NOTE> Having treated, in the preceding
Di&s;cour&s;e, of the commencement, let us
now contemplate the clo&s;e, of all human
things. The di&s;&s;olution of the material
&s;y&s;tem is an article of our faith, often allu|ded
<PB N="414" REF="427">
to in the Old Te&s;tament, clearly pre|dicted
in the New. It is an article of faith
&s;o far from being incredible, that many
appearances in nature lead to the belief of
it. We &s;ee all terre&s;trial &s;ub&s;tances chan|ging
their form. Nothing that con&s;i&s;ts of
matter, is formed for perpetual duration.
Every thing around us, is impaired and
con&s;umed by time; waxes old by degrees,
and tends to decay. There is rea&s;on, there|fore,
to believe, that a &s;tructure &s;o complex
as the world mu&s;t be liable to the &s;ame
law; and &s;hall, at &s;ome period, undergo
the &s;ame fate. Through many changes, the
earth has already pa&s;&s;ed; many &s;hocks it
has received, and &s;till is often receiving. A
great portion of what is now dry land ap|pears,
from various tokens, to have been
once covered with water. Continents bear
the marks of having been violently rent,
and torn a&s;under from one another. New
i&s;lands have ri&s;en from the bottom of the
ocean; thrown up by the force of &s;ubter|raneous
fire. Formidable earthquakes have,
in divers quarters, &s;haken the globe; and
<PB N="415" REF="428">
at this hour terrify, with their alarms, ma|ny
parts of it. Burning mountains have,
for ages, been di&s;charging torrents of flame;
and from time to time renew their explo|&s;ions,
in various regions. All the&s;e circum|&s;tances
&s;how, that in the bowels of the
earth, the in&s;truments of its di&s;&s;olution are
formed. To our view, who behold only
its &s;urface, it may appear firm and un&s;ha|ken;
while its de&s;truction is preparing in
&s;ecret. The ground on which we tread is
undermined. Combu&s;tible materials are
&s;tored. The train is laid. When the mine
is to &s;pring, none of us can fore&s;ee.</P>
<P>Accu&s;tomed to behold the cour&s;e of na|ture
proceeding in regular order, we in|dulge,
meanwhile, our plea&s;ures and pur|&s;uits
with full &s;ecurity; and &s;uch awful
&s;cenes as the convul&s;ion of the elements,
and the di&s;&s;olution of the world, are fo|reign
to our thoughts. Yet, as it is certain
that &s;ome generation of men mu&s;t witne&s;s
this great cata&s;trophe, it is fit and proper
that we &s;hould &s;ometimes look forward to
it. Such pro&s;pects may not, indeed, be al|luring
<PB N="416" REF="429">
to the bulk of men. But they carry
a grandeur and &s;olemnity, which are con|genial
to &s;ome of the mo&s;t dignified feel|ings
in our nature; and tend to produce
elevation of thought. Amid&s;t the circle of
levities and follies, of little plea&s;ures and
little cares, which fill up the ordinary round
of life, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we be occa&s;ional|ly
excited to attend to what is &s;erious and
great. Such events as are now to be the
&s;ubject of our meditation, awake the &s;lum|bering
mind; check the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of
idle thought, and bring home our recollect|tion
to what mo&s;t concerns us, as men and
Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Let us think what a&s;toni&s;hment would
have filled our minds, and what devout e|motions
would have &s;welled our hearts, if
we could have been &s;pectators of the crea|tion
of the world; if we had &s;een the earth
when it aro&s;e at fir&s;t <HI>without form and void,</HI>
and beheld its parts arranged by the divine
word; if we had heard the voice of the
Almighty, calling light to &s;pring forth from
the <HI>darkne&s;s that was on the face of the deep;</HI>
<PB N="417" REF="430">
if we had &s;een the &s;un ari&s;ing, for the fir&s;t
time, in the ea&s;t with maje&s;tic glory; and
all nature in&s;tantly beginning to teem with
life. This wonderful &s;cene, it was impo&s;|&s;ible
that any human eye could behold. It
was a &s;pectacle afforded only to angels, and
&s;uperior &s;pirits. But to a &s;pectacle no le&s;s
a&s;toni&s;hing, the final di&s;&s;olution of the
world, we know there &s;hall be many hu|man
witne&s;&s;es. The race of men living in
that la&s;t age, &s;hall &s;ee the pre&s;ages of the
approaching fatal day. There &s;hall be <HI>&s;igns
in the &s;un,</HI> as the Scripture informs us, <HI>and</HI>

di&s;tre&s;s of nations, with perplexity; the &s;ea

to ruin. They &s;hall feel the globe
&s;hake; &s;hall behold their cities fall; and
the final conflagration begin to kindle a|round

&s;cene; imagining our&s;elves to be already
&s;pectators of it, let us,</P>
<P><PB N="418" REF="431">
I. CONTEMPLATE the Supreme Being
directing the di&s;&s;olution, as he directed the
original formation, of the world. He is
the great agent in this wonderful tran&s;ac|tion.
It was by him fore&s;een. It was by
him intended; it entered into his plan
from the moment of creation. This world
was de&s;tined from the beginning to fulfil a
certain period; and then its duration was
to terminate. Not that it is any plea&s;ure to
the Almighty, to di&s;play his omnipotence
in de&s;troying the works which he has made;
but as for wi&s;e and good purpo&s;es the earth
was formed, &s;o for wi&s;e and good ends it
is di&s;&s;olved, when the time mo&s;t proper for
its termination is come. He who, in the
coun&s;els of his Providence, brings about &s;o
many revolutions among mankind; who
<HI>changeth the times and the &s;ea&s;ons;</HI> who rai|&s;es
up empires to rule, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, among
the nations, and at his plea&s;ure puts an end
to their glory; hath al&s;o fixed a term for
the earth it&s;elf, the &s;eat of all human great|ne&s;s.
He &s;aw it meet, that after the pro|bationary
cour&s;e was fini&s;hed, which the
<PB N="419" REF="432">
generations of men were to accompli&s;h,
their pre&s;ent habitation &s;hould be made to
pa&s;s away. Of the &s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of the
period when this change &s;hould take place,
no being can judge, except the Lord of the
univer&s;e. The&s;e are coun&s;els, into which
it is not ours to penetrate. But amid&s;t this
great revolution of nature, our comfort is,
that it is a revolution brought about by
Him, the mea&s;ures of who&s;e government
are all founded in goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is called in the text, <HI>the day of the Lord;</HI>
a day peculiarly his, as known to him on|ly;
a day in which he &s;hall appear with
uncommon and tremendous maje&s;ty. But
though it be the day of the terrors of the
Lord, yet from the&s;e terrors, his upright
and faithful &s;ubjects &s;hall have nothing to
apprehend. They may remain &s;afe and
quiet &s;pectators of the threatening &s;cene.
For it is not to be a &s;cene of blind confu|&s;ion;
of univer&s;al ruin, brought about by
unde&s;igning chance. Over the &s;hock of
the elements, sund the wreck of nature,
Eternal Wi&s;dom pre&s;ides. According to its
<PB N="420" REF="433">
direction, the conflagration advances which
is to con&s;ume the earth. Amid&s;t every
convul&s;ion of the world, God &s;hall conti|nue
to be, as he was from the beginning,
<HI>the dwelling-place of his &s;ervants to all gene|rations.</HI>
The world may be lo&s;t to them;
but the ruler of the world is ever the &s;ame,
unchangeably good and ju&s;t This is the
<HI>high tower</HI> to which they can fly, and be
&s;afe. <HI>The righteous</HI> Lord loveth righteou&s;|ne&s;s;
and under every period of his govern|ment,
<HI>his countenance beholdeth the upright.</HI></P>
<P>II. LET us contemplate the di&s;&s;olution of
the world, as the end of all human glory.
This earth has been the theatre of many a
great &s;pectacle, and many a high atchieve|ment.
There, the wi&s;e have ruled, the
mighty have fought, and conquerors have
triumphed. Its &s;urface has been covered
with proud and &s;tately cities. Its temples
and palaces have rai&s;ed their heads to the
&s;kies. Its kings and potentates, glorying
in their magnificence, have erected pyra|mids,
con&s;tructed towers, founded monu|ments,
<PB N="421" REF="434">
which they imagined were to defy
all the a&s;&s;aults of time. <HI>Their inward
thought was, that their hou&s;es were to conti|nue
for ever, and their dwelling-places to all
generations.</HI> Its philo&s;ophers have explored
the &s;ecrets of nature; and flattered them|&s;elves,
that the fame of their di&s;coveries
was to be immortal.&mdash;Alas! all this was
no more than a tran&s;ient &s;how. Not only
<HI>the fa&s;hion of the world,</HI> but the world it|&s;elf,
<HI>pa&s;&s;eth away.</HI> The day cometh, when
all the glory of this world &s;hall be remem|bered,
only as <HI>a dream when one awaketh.</HI>
No longer &s;hall the earth exhibit any of
tho&s;e &s;cenes which now delight our eyes.
The whole beautiful fabric is thrown down,
never more to ari&s;e. As &s;oon as the de|&s;troying
angel has &s;ounded the la&s;t trum|pet,
the everla&s;ting mountains fall; the
foundations of the world are &s;haken; the
beauties of nature, the decorations of art,
the labours of indu&s;try, peri&s;h in one com|mon
flame. The globe it&s;elf &s;hall either
return into its ancient chaos, <HI>without form
and void;</HI> or, like a &s;tar fallen from the
<PB N="422" REF="435">
heavens, &s;hall be effaced from the univer&s;e,
and <HI>its place &s;hall know it no more.</HI></P>
<P>THIS day of the Lord, it is foretold in
the text, <HI>will come as a thief in the night;</HI>
that is, &s;udden and unexpected. Mankind,
notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ages given them,
&s;hall continue to the la&s;t in their wonted
&s;ecurity. Our Saviour tells us, that <HI>as in
the days of Noah before the flood, they were
eating and drinking, marrying and giving in
marriage, until the flood came, and took them
all away; &s;o &s;hall al&s;o the coming of the Son of
man be.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Matthew, xxiv. 38.</NOTE>&mdash;How many projects and de|&s;igns
&s;hall that day &s;uddenly confound?
What long-contrived &s;chemes of plea&s;ure
&s;hall it overthrow? What plans of cunning
and ambition &s;hall it utterly bla&s;t? How
mi&s;erable they, whom it &s;hall overtake in
the mid&s;t of dark con&s;piracies, of criminal
deeds, or profligate plea&s;ures? In what
&s;trong colours is their di&s;may painted, when
they are repre&s;ented in the book of Reve|lations,
<PB N="423" REF="436">
as calling <HI>to the hills and mountains
to fall on them and cover them?</HI>&mdash;Such de|&s;criptions
are apt to be con&s;idered as exag|gerated.
The impre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e awful
events is weakened by the great di&s;tance of
time, at which our imagination places
them. But have not we had a &s;triking
image &s;et before us, in our own age, of the
terrors which the day of the Lord &s;hall pro|duce,
by tho&s;e partial ruins of the world,
which the vi&s;itation of God has brought on
countries well known, and not removed very
far from our&s;elves? When in the mid&s;t of
peace, opulence, and &s;ecurity, &s;uddenly the
earth was felt by the terrified inhabitants to
tremble, with violent agitation, below them;
when their hou&s;es began to &s;hake over their
heads, and to overwhelm them with ruins;
the flood, at the &s;ame time, to ri&s;e from its
bed, and to &s;well around them; when en|compa&s;&s;ed
with univer&s;al de&s;olation, no
friend could aid another; no pro&s;pect of
e&s;cape appeared; no place of refuge remain|ed;
how &s;imilar were &s;uch &s;cenes of de|&s;truction
to the terrors of the la&s;t day?
<PB N="424" REF="437">
What &s;imilar &s;en&s;ations of dread, and re|mor&s;e,
and too late repentance, mu&s;t they
have excited among the guilty and pro|fane?</P>
<P>To &s;uch formidable convul&s;ions of na|ture,
we, in the&s;e happy i&s;lands, through
the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, are &s;trangers; and
&s;trangers to them may we long continue!
But however we may e&s;cape partial ruins
of the globe, in its general and final ruin,
we al&s;o mu&s;t be involved. To us mu&s;t
come at la&s;t that awful day, when the &s;un
&s;hall for the la&s;t time ari&s;e, to perform his
concluding circuit round the world. They
how ble&s;t, whom that day &s;hall find em|ployed
in religious acts, or virtuous deeds;
in the con&s;cientious di&s;charge of the duties
of life; in the exerci&s;e of due preparation
for the conclu&s;ion of human things, and for
appearing before the great Judge of the
world! Let us now,</P>
<P>III. CONTEMPLATE the &s;oul of man, as
remaining unhurt in the mid&s;t of this gene|ral
de&s;olation, when the whole animal crea|tion
<PB N="425" REF="438">
peri&s;hes, and the whole frame of na|ture
falls into ruins. What a high idea
does this pre&s;ent, of the dignity pertaining
to the rational &s;pirit! The world may fall
back into chaos; but, &s;uperior to matter,
and independent of all the changes of ma|terial
things, the &s;oul continues the &s;ame.
When <HI>the heavens pa&s;s away with a great
noi&s;e, and the elements melt with fervent heat,</HI>
the &s;oul of man, &s;tamped for immortality,
retains its &s;tate unimpaired; and is capable
of flouri&s;hing in undecaying youth and vi|gour.
Very different indeed the condition
of human &s;pirits is to be, according as
their different qualities have marked,
and prepared them, for different future man|&s;ions.
But for futurity, they are all de|&s;tined.
Exi&s;tence, &s;till, is theirs. The ca|pacity
of permanent felicity they all po&s;|&s;e&s;s;
and, if they enjoy it not, it is owing to
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Here then, let us behold what is the true
honour and excellence of man. It con&s;i&s;ts
not in his body; which, beautiful or vigo|rous
as it may now &s;eem, is no other than
<PB N="426" REF="439">
a fabrick of du&s;t, quickly to return to du&s;t
again. It is not derived from any connec|tion
he can form with earthly things; which,
as we have &s;een, are all doomed to peri&s;h.
It con&s;i&s;ts in that thinking part, which is
&s;u&s;ceptible of intellectual improvement and
moral worth; which was formed after the
image of God; which is capable of perpe|tual
progre&s;s in drawing nearer to his na|ture;
and &s;hall partake of the divine eter|nity,
when time and the world &s;hall be no
more. This is all that is re&s;pectable in man.
By this alone, he is rai&s;ed above peri&s;hable
&s;ub&s;tances, and allied to tho&s;e that are ce|le&s;tial
and immortal. This part of our na|ture,
then, let us cultivate with care; and,
on its improvement, re&s;t our &s;elf-e&s;timation.
If, on the contrary, &s;uffering our&s;elves to
be wholly immer&s;ed in matter, plunged in
the dregs of &s;en&s;uality, we behave as if we
were only made for the body and its ani|mal
plea&s;ures, how degenerate and ba&s;e do
we become? De&s;tined to &s;urvive this whole
material &s;y&s;tem, &s;ent forth to run the race of
immortality and glory, &s;hall we thus abu&s;e
<PB N="427" REF="440">
our Maker's goodne&s;s, degrade our origi|nal
honour, and &s;ink our&s;elves into de&s;er|ved
mi&s;ery? It remains, that,</P>
<P>IV. WE contemplate the di&s;&s;olution of
the world, as the introduction to a greater
and nobler &s;y&s;tem, in the government of
God. <HI>We, according to his promi&s;e, look for
new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwel|leth
righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">2 Peter, iii. 13.</NOTE>. Temporal things are
now to give place to things eternal. To
this earthly habitation is to &s;ucceed the city
of the living God. The earth had com|pleted
the purpo&s;e for which is was created.
It had been employed as a theatre, on which
the human generations were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to
come forth, and to fulfil their term of trial.
As long as the period of trial continued,
much ob&s;curity was of cour&s;e to cover the
coun&s;els of Providence. It was appointed,
that <HI>all things</HI> &s;hould appear as <HI>coming alike
to all;</HI> that the righteous &s;hould &s;eem of|ten
neglected by Heaven, and the wicked be
<PB N="428" REF="441">
allowed externally to pro&s;per; in order that
virtue and piety might undergo a proper
te&s;t; that it might be &s;hown who were &s;in|cere
adherents to con&s;cience, and who were
mere followers of fortune. The day which
terminates the duration of the world, ter|minates
all tho&s;e &s;eeming di&s;orders. The
time of trial is concluded. The final di&s;|crimination
of characters is made. When
the righteous go to everla&s;ting happine&s;s,
and the wicked are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed into the re|gions
of puni&s;hment, the whole my&s;tery of
human affairs is unravelled; and the con|duct
of Providence is ju&s;tified to man.</P>
<P>Suited to a condition of trial was the &s;tate
and form of the world, which we now in|habit.
It was not de&s;igned to be a man&s;ion
for innocent and happy &s;pirits; but a dwell|ing
for creatures of fallen nature, and of
mixed characters. Hence, tho&s;e mixtures
of plea&s;ure and pain, of di&s;order and beau|ty,
with which it abounds. Hence, &s;ome
regions of the earth, per&s;enting gay and
plea&s;ing &s;cenes; others, exhibiting nothing
but ruggedne&s;s and deformity; the face of
<PB N="429" REF="442">
nature, &s;ometimes brightened by a &s;erene
atmo&s;phere, and a &s;plendid &s;un; &s;ometimes
disfigured by jarring elements, and over|ca&s;t
with troubled &s;kies. But far unlike
&s;hall be the everla&s;ting habitations of the
ju&s;t: Though how they are formed, or
what objects they contain, is not given us
not to conceive; nor, in all probability,
would our faculties be equal to the con|ception.
The emblematical de&s;criptions of
them in Scripture, are calculated to excite
high ideas of magnificence and glory. This
one particular we know with certainty, that
<HI>therein dwelleth righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> that is, com|plete
virtue and eternal order; and where|ever
the&s;e are found, the mo&s;t perfect
&s;ources are opened of joy and bli&s;s. This
earth was never intended for more than the
outer court, the porch, through which the
righteous were to pa&s;s into the temple and
&s;anctuary of the Divinity. <HI>When that which
is perfect is come, that which is in part &s;hall be
done away.</HI></P>
<P>THE inference which follows from what
<PB N="430" REF="443">
has been &s;aid on this &s;ubject, cannot be &s;o
well expre&s;&s;ed as in the words of the Apo&s;tle,
in the ver&s;e immediately following the text;
<HI>&s;eeing that all the&s;e things &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved,
what manner of per&s;ons ought we to be in all
holy conver&s;ation and godline&s;s?</HI> Ought not
the important di&s;coveries which have been
made to us, of the de&s;igns of the Almighty,
and of the de&s;tiny of man, to exalt our &s;en|timents,
and to purify our life from what
is vitious or vain? While we pur&s;ue the
bu&s;ine&s;s and cares of our pre&s;ent &s;tation,
and partake of the innocent plea&s;ures which
the world affords, let us maintain that dig|nity
of character, which becomes immortal
beings; let us act with that circum&s;pection,
which becomes tho&s;e who know they are
&s;oon to &s;tand before the judgement-&s;eat of
the Son of God: In a word, let us &s;tudy to
be what we would wi&s;h to be found, if to
us the day of the Lord &s;hould come.</P>
<P>I KNOW it will occur, that the pro&s;pect of
that day cannot be expected to have much
influence of the pre&s;ent age. The events
<PB N="431" REF="444">
of which I have treated, mu&s;t needs, it will
be &s;aid, belong to &s;ome future race of men.
Many prophecies yet remain to be fulfilled.
Many preparatory events mu&s;t take place,
before the world is ripe for final judgement.
&mdash;Whether this be the ca&s;e of not, none
of us with certainty know.&mdash;But allow me
to remind you, that to each of us, an event
is approaching, and not far di&s;tant, which
&s;hall prove of the &s;ame effect, with the co|ming
of the day of the Lord. The day of
death is, to every individual, the &s;ame as
the day of the di&s;&s;olution of the world.
The &s;un may continue to &s;hine; but to
them who are laid in the grave, his light is
finally extingui&s;hed. The world may re|main
active, bu&s;y, and noi&s;y; but to them,
all is &s;ilence. The voice which gives the
mandate, <HI>Return again to your du&s;t,</HI> is the
&s;ame with the &s;ound of the la&s;t trumpet.
Death fixes the doom of every one, finally
and irrevocably. This &s;urely is an event
which none of us can remove in our
thoughts to a remote age. To-morrow,
to-day, the fatal mandate may be i&s;|&s;ued.
<PB N="432" REF="445">
<HI>Watch therefore; be &s;ober and vigi|lant;
ye know not at what hour the Son of
Man cometh.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING now treated both of the crea|tion
and di&s;&s;olution of the world, I cannot
conclude, without calling your thoughts to
the magnificent view, which the&s;e events
give us, of the kingdom and dominion of
the Almighty. With reverence we con|template
his hand in the &s;ignal di&s;pen&s;a|tions
of Providence among men; deciding
the fate of battles; rai&s;ing up, or overthrow|ing
empires; ca&s;ting down the proud, and
lifting the low from the du&s;t. But what
are &s;uch occurrences to the power and wi&s;|dom,
which He di&s;plays in the higher re|volutions
of the univer&s;e; by his word,
forming, or di&s;&s;olving worlds; at his plea|&s;ure,
tran&s;planting his creatures from one
world to another; that he may carry on
new plans of wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, and
fill all &s;pace with the wonders of creation!
Succe&s;&s;ive generations of men have ari&s;en
to po&s;&s;e&s;s the earth. By turns they have
<PB N="433" REF="446">
pa&s;&s;ed away, and gone into regions un|known.
Us he hath rai&s;ed up, to occupy
their room. We too &s;hall &s;hortly di&s;appear.
But human exi&s;tence never peri&s;hes. Life
only changes its form, and is renewed.
Creation is ever filling, but never full.
When the whole intended cour&s;e of the ge|nerations
of men &s;hall be fini&s;hed, then, as
a &s;hepherd leads his flock from one pa&s;ture
to another, &s;o the great Creator leads forth
the &s;ouls which he has made, into new and
prepared abodes of life. They go from this
earth to a new earth, and new heavens;
and &s;till they remove, only from one pro|vince
of the divine dominion to another.
Amid&s;t all tho&s;e changes of nature, the great
Ruler him&s;elf remains, <HI>without variablene&s;s
or &s;hadow of turning.</HI> To him, the&s;e &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive
revolutions of being are but <HI>as yet&s;terday
when it is pa&s;t.</HI> From his eternal throne, he
beholds worlds ri&s;ing and pa&s;&s;ing away;
mea&s;ures out, to the creatures who inhabit
them, powers and faculties &s;uited to their
&s;tate; and di&s;tributes among them rewards
and puni&s;hments, proportioned to their ac|tions.
<PB N="434" REF="447">
&mdash;What an a&s;toni&s;hing view do &s;uch
meditations afford of the kingdom of God;
infinite in its extent; everla&s;ting in its du|ration;
exhibiting, in every period, the
reign of perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s and wi&s;dom!
<HI>Who by &s;earching can find out God? who can
find out the Almighty to perfection? Great
and marvellous are all thy works, Lord God
Almighty! Ju&s;t and true are all thy ways,
thou King of &s;aints!</HI></P>
