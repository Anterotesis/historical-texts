<HEAD>A CHARGE TO THE GRAND JURY Of the County of MIDDLESEX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Gentlemen of the Grand Inque&s;t,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_AT the Opening of the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion I was led, by a Retro&s;pect on the Tran&s;actions of the preceding Month, to give to the Grand Inque&s;t, then attending on this Court, in a Charge, which, as having neither Lei&s;ure or Opportunity to prepare my&s;elf for any other, was unpremeditated, &s;ome general Directions for their Conduct in the Execution of their Office, together with &s;ome Information touching the Nature and Extent of their Authority, adapted par|ticularly to that Cri&s;is.</P>
<P>Whether the like Kind of Nece&s;&s;ity yet &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, I have neither inquired nor am in|formed: I tru&s;t it does not; and that there remain but few of tho&s;e who were found active in the late daring Outrages, that have not either &s;atisfied the Ju&s;tice of the Law, or experienced that Clemency which, in all favourable Ca&s;es, his Maje&s;ty is di&s;po&s;ed to extend.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">Neverthele&s;s, while there exi&s;ts a Po&s;&s;ibility that, in Con&s;equence of recent Information, or &s;ome other warrantable Ground for Pro&s;e|cution, you may be called to the Exerci&s;e of that Power and Authority which the Law has entru&s;ted you with, in the bringing to a legal Trial the Di&s;turbers of the public Peace, I hold it my Duty to give you, that now attend for that Purpo&s;e, &s;uch In&s;truction and Advice as I am able, for the faithful and con&s;cientious Di&s;charge of your Office: And to this I think my&s;elf the more obliged, by the Con&s;ideration that there may be &s;ome among you to whom, as never having at|tended in this Capacity before, &s;uch In&s;truc|tion and Advice may be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>To all which I add, that this Court being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no Power of controuling your Deliberations, or of rectifying, other than in Matters of Form, any of the Mi&s;takes, Er|rors, or Imperfections you might innocently fall into, or which might appear on the Face of any of your Pre&s;entments, it cannot but be of Importance to the Properties, the Li|berties, and even the Lives of your fellow Subjects, as al&s;o for the Ea&s;e and Quiet of your own Minds, and greatly for the Benefit of the Public, that your Judgments &s;hould be well informed as to the Nature and Extent, and the Rea&s;ons that oblige you to the con&s;cientious Exerci&s;e, of your Authority.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">Upon this Ground, and before I proceed to enumerate the &s;everal Heads into which the criminal Law of this Country is branch|ed out, I mu&s;t inform you, that your Juri&s;|diction extends to all &s;uch Offences as the Law, no le&s;s emphatically than truly, declares to be again&s;t the King's, or, which is the &s;ame, the public Peace.</P>
<P>The Motives to peaceable Conduct, or, in other Words, of Submi&s;&s;ion to that legal Power, the chief End whereof is the Pre&s;er|vation of Peace and its con&s;equent Ble&s;&s;ing Liberty, are of various Kinds; but with the generality of People there is one that human Laws nave ever in View, namely, the Penal|ties that follow the Violation of public or private Rights; but Penalties have very little Effect on the Mind, they operate only on the Will; and it is a higher Principle than the Dread of Puni&s;hment that mu&s;t di&s;po&s;e Men to be either good Subjects or good Neigh|bours. By this higher Principle I mean nothing le&s;s than that Reverence for legal Government, which, in the Opinion of the Wi&s;e and Judicious in all Ages, is but its Due.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not need to trouble you with any of tho&s;e Notions touching the Origin of civil Government, which have employed the Thoughts and Pens of &s;peculative Politici|ans: As little do I mean to decide upon that
<PB N="8" REF="7">
controverted Que&s;tion, whether the Power of the &s;upreme Magi&s;trate be the Grant of God, or the Gift of the People; and the rather, becau&s;e there is, in my Apprehen|&s;ion, a middle Hypothe&s;is that removes all the Difficulties that have hitherto embar|ra&s;&s;ed this &s;ubtile Que&s;tion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>Touching the Origin of civil Government, there are two Opinions &s;everally maintained by the Writers on that Subject: the one termed the <HI>patriarchal</HI>, which &s;uppo&s;es the Right of Dominion to be founded on the expre&s;s Donation of God, the other called the <HI>popular</HI> Scheme, which &s;uppo&s;es the &s;ame Right to be the Gift, or to ari&s;e from the Con&s;ent, of the People. Of the former, Sir <HI>Robert Filmer, Hobbes</HI> of <HI>Malmes|bury</HI>, and a few others; of the latter, Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>, and, if I remember right, Bi&s;hop <HI>Hoadley</HI>, are the Abettors.</P><P>The middle Hypothe&s;is above hinted at is, that the Rights, the Powers, and Privileges of Dominion are from God, but the Choice of the Per&s;on who &s;hall exerci&s;e them is the Right of the People.</P><P>A late very ingenious Writer, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Henry Grove</HI>, of <HI>Taunton</HI>, was the fir&s;t, in his own Opinion, that di&s;covered this Middle Scheme, concerning which he &s;peaks as follows: <Q>&startq;There may po&s;&s;ibly be Advantages peculiar to each of the&s;e [the popular and the patriarchal] Schemes, and whether the Patrons of them will own it or no, there are Difficulties and Objections too that embarra&s;s both.&mdash;Now if there be any third Hypothe&s;is, which, having the main Advantages of the&s;e two, provides again&s;t the ill Con&s;equences of each, it ought certainly to have the Preference. I am mi&s;taken if the following does not bid fair for it: The Hypothe&s;is in &s;hort is this, That all Power is directly from God, not by po&s;itive Appointment, but as he is plea&s;ed to &s;ignify his &s;overeign Will by the Nature of Things, leaving it to the Choice and Di&s;cretion of People among whom Governments are not yet e&s;tabli&s;hed, in what Form, by what Per&s;ons, and on what Conditions this Power &s;hall be exerci&s;ed. The Power it&s;elf flows from the Will of the Creator, declared with that Plainne&s;s and Evidence that no Part of Mankind can be ig|norant &endq;of it.</Q> See an E&s;&s;ay on the Origin and Extent of civil Power among the Mi&s;cellanies of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Henry Grove</HI>, Octavo, 1739.</P><P>But this Author &s;eems to have been little aware that the very &s;ame Doctrine is the Subject of an E&s;&s;ay upon Government, written by Dr. <HI>Thomas Burnett</HI>, Rector of <HI>We&s;t Kington</HI>, in the County of <HI>Wilts</HI>, and printed fir&s;t in Duodecimo in $word$ and again in Octavo in 1726, wherein he thus declares his Senti|ments: <Q>&startq;As the Welfare of Society is the End and Rea&s;on of all Government, &s;o the different Intere&s;ts of different Societies is the Rea&s;on of the different Forms of it: And as it cannot be doubted, but that the&s;e different Forms were devi&s;ed by Men, &s;o though the Authority of Government be from God, yet the Appointment of the Per&s;ons to execute that Authority is purely and intirely the Ordinance of Man. And this gives an Account of that Expre&s;&s;ion, 1 <HI>Peter</HI> ii. 13. of being &s;ub|ject to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's Sake; by which is meant, that tho&s;e who are intru&s;ted with the Go+vernment of Societies in any Kind of Form, are only the Ordinance of Men; but yet, though they are &s;o, they are neverthele&s;s to be &s;ubmitted to, for the Lord's Sake, becau&s;e they execute that Power in Behalf of the Society, which &endq;every Society has from God.</Q> Lib. cit. Page 32, Edit. 1726.</P><P>The Coincidence of Opinions between the&s;e two Writers is very remarkable, &s;eeing that, without being con&s;cious of &s;o doing, they illu&s;trate the Arguments of each other; and it cannot but be Ma$ter of Surpri&s;e to find, as the Reader may, the very &s;ame Doctrine maintained by that very able and judi|cious Writer on Government, <HI>Hooker</HI>, in the following Pa&s;&s;age, in the eighth Book of his Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity, Page 444. Edit. 1682. <Q>&startq;On whom Power is be&s;towed at Men's Di&s;cretion, they do hold it by Divine Right: If God, in his revealed Word, hath appointed &s;uch Power to be, although him&s;elf extraordinarily be&s;tow it not, but leave the Appointment of Per&s;ons to Men; yea albeit God do neither appoint nor a&s;|&s;ign the Per&s;on; Neverthele&s;s, when Men have a&s;&s;igned and e&s;tabli&s;hed both, Who doth doubt but that &s;undry Duties and Affairs depending thereupon are pre&s;cribed by the Word of God, and con&s;equently by that very Right to be exacted? For Example Sake, the Power which <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors had over foreign Provinces, was not a Thing which the Law of God did ever in&s;titute: Neither was <HI>Tiberius Cae&s;ar</HI> by e&s;pe|cial Commi&s;&s;ion from Heaven therewith inve&s;ted, and yet Payment of Tribute unto <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>, being now made Emperor, is the plain Law of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> Unto Kings by <HI>human</HI> &endq;Right, Honour, by very <HI>divine</HI> Right, is due.</Q> The Doc|trine above advanced is finely illu&s;trated by the &s;ame Author in the following apt Compari&s;on: <Q>&startq;The Law appointeth no Man to be a Hu&s;band; but if a Man hath betaken him&s;elf unto that Condition, it giveth him Power and Authority &endq;over his own Wife.</Q></P><P>The&s;e Citations &s;eem abundantly to prove again&s;t the No|tion of a Grant in the one Scheme, or a Donation in the other, yet comprehending both; that the Authority of the Magi&s;trate does, by divine Appointment, <HI>re&s;ult from</HI>, or ari&s;e out of, the Relation between him and his People, in like Manner as that of a Hu&s;band does from the Relation between him and his Wife.</P></NOTE>. It is &s;ufficient here to &s;ay, that Government was originally in&s;tituted of Nece&s;&s;ity; and being calculat|ed,
<PB N="9" REF="8">
not merely to avert the Evils to which a State of Nature mu&s;t have expo&s;ed Mankind, but to promote and en&s;ure all the various
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Ble&s;&s;ings of Society, and by directing, con|trouling, and regulating the &s;ocial Offices in this Life to fit and prepare us for a better, it is, and mu&s;t ever be deemed, an Object of high Veneration.</P>
<P>Omitting then an Inquiry into the Ori|gin, let us look to the Ends of Government, which we &s;hall find to be no other than the Good of the People, or, in other Words, the promoting, by Laws and political In|&s;titutions founded in Wi&s;dom and Ju&s;tice and corre&s;ponding with the revealed Will of God, the Happine&s;s of tho&s;e who are the Subjects of it, or over whom it is exerci&s;ed: Whatever are the Di&s;tinctions, the Honours, the Emoluments with which they are in|ve&s;ted,
<PB N="11" REF="10">
who hold or which accrue from the Exerci&s;e of great Offices in the State, the&s;e are merely incidental: In a Word, not for the Sake of the Governours, but of the governed, was civil Government fir&s;t in&s;tituted.</P>
<P>But as the Ends of Government cannot be an&s;wered without Subordination and legal Submi&s;&s;ion on the Part of tho&s;e who derive Benefit from it, there nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ults an Obligation on the People, of Obedience to the legi&s;lative and executive Powers, in what Hands &s;oever lodged: And not to Obedi|ence only, but to Re&s;pect and Veneration, without which Government is in Fact, what all Laws do but pre&s;ume it to be, Coercion; and tho&s;e Re&s;traints will be looked on as little better than Slavery, which are in Truth the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible Security of Liberty. For if we admit, as we mu&s;t, that there is a Principle in Men that di&s;po&s;es them to re&s;i&s;t Authority, what is Government but Force? and that there is &s;uch a Principle no one can deny, who is at all acquainted with human Nature <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laws politic, ordained for public Order and Regimen among&s;t Men, are never framed as they &s;hould be, unle&s;s pre&s;uming the Will of Man to be inwardly ob&s;tinate, rebel|lious, and aver&s;e from all Obedience unto the &s;acred Laws of his Nature: in a Word, unle&s;s pre&s;uming Man, in regard of his depraved Mind, little better than a wild Bea&s;t, they do accordingly provide, notwith&s;tanding, &s;o to frame his outward Actions, that they be no Hindrance unto the common Good, for which Societies were in&s;tituted: Unle&s;s they do this, they are not perfect. <HI>Hooker</HI>'s Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity, Page 85.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">That &s;uch Re&s;pect and Veneration as is here mentioned is due from the People to their Governours, is not only deducible from the Principles of natural Rea&s;on, and the uniform Tenor of the Sacred Writings, exhorting us to a dutiful Subjection and Obedience to lawful Authority <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Rom.</HI> xiii. 1. <HI>Titus</HI> iii. 1. 1 <HI>Peter</HI> ii. 13.</NOTE>, but the Exerci&s;e of the&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the Exi&s;tence of Order and the Pro|motion of national Happine&s;s, is clearly di&s;|cernible in the Conduct of Mankind and the Oeconomy of the World from the earlie&s;t Ages to the pre&s;ent; and that not only in Countries and Nations where the Arts of civil Life, the Refinements of human Policy, and the Precepts of Religion have been equally unknown; but in tho&s;e enlightened Regions where the Powers of Rea&s;on and Reflection have been cultivated to the Height of Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>The&s;e Arguments, drawn from the Na|ture and End of Government, the Sanction of Holy Scripture, and the general A&s;&s;ent and Practice of Mankind, might be thought &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;o &s;imple a Po&s;ition as that the Obligations of the Government, or, to adapt the Term to our own Con&s;ti|tution, of the Prince and his People, are re|ciprocal; &s;o that if the Duty of one be to afford Protection, that of the other is to
<PB N="13" REF="12">
yield Obedience; yet may they be further enforced, by a Reflection on the Utility of Government, as manife&s;ted in the Ble&s;|&s;ings it di&s;pen&s;es, as well in the Execution as the framing of Laws for the Benefit and Security of the Subject. Ble&s;&s;ings which can only be e&s;timated by a Com|pari&s;on that places the Enjoyment of Wealth, the Fruits of Indu&s;try, and the Sweets of dome&s;tic Felicity on the one Hand, and Terror, Rapine, and De&s;olation on the other.</P>
<P>To the Arguments ari&s;ing from the Bene|fits to Society which Government en&s;ures, I might add the many others deducible from the Mi&s;eries that attend the Want of it; but the&s;e are evident. Neverthele&s;s, I cannot omit to mention a political Artifice, a cruel one I confe&s;s, which we are told was formerly practi&s;ed in one of the four great Monarchies pointed out by the Pro|phet <HI>Daniel</HI>; I mean that of the ancient <HI>Per&s;ians</HI>; among whom it was a Cu&s;tom, immediately on the Death of their Kings, to proclaim a Su&s;pen&s;ion of the Laws, and Im|punity to Offenders for five Days; during which interval the Ravages and Depredati|ons of Robbers, and other lawle&s;s Men, were u&s;ually &s;o great, as to drive the People to an Impatience for the Re&s;toration of Govern|ment, and a willing Submi&s;&s;ion to that
<PB N="14" REF="13">
Authority which uninterrupted national Fe|licity frequently induces Men to undervalue, if not contemn.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Con&s;iderations on the Nature and End of Government, the Tran&s;ition is obvious to tho&s;e Laws that tend to the Sup|port of it; and here let me ob&s;erve, that, although in common Speech we are fre|quently led to &s;ay, that the Laws are the King's Laws, and in the Bills preferred to you Offences are &s;aid to be again&s;t the King's Peace, yet are the Laws no le&s;s the Laws of the People than of the King; the&s;e, and all the Benefits ari&s;ing from them, the Freedom of his Per&s;on, the Security of his Property, the Protection of his Dwelling, and of his Wife and Children, the&s;e, I &s;ay, an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> regards as the Price of his Allegiance, and claims and challenges as his Birthright.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to an Explanation of the Nature of your Office, and an Enume|ration of the &s;everal Offences of which it gives you Cognizance. As to the fir&s;t, you are to under&s;tand, that in all Ca&s;es which draw into Que&s;tion the Life, the Liberty, or the Property of the Subject, the Judgment of the Law is &s;ounded on the Determination of twelve Men; which Determination, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;ult from a careful Inve&s;tiga|tion and Inquiry into the Truth of the Ca&s;e, is called a Verdict. This is the ordinary
<PB N="15" REF="14">
Proce&s;s in civil Ca&s;es, which go no farther than to draw into Que&s;tion a Man's Title to his E&s;tate, or &s;ubject him to a Demand of Reparation in Damages for mere per&s;onal Injuries: In the&s;e In&s;tances the Delinquent is immediately called upon to an&s;wer the Charge of his Adver&s;ary, even though the &s;ubject Matter of it be groundle&s;s, frivolous, or vex|atious: But in criminal Matters, that is to &s;ay, in Trea&s;on, Felony, and Breaches of the Peace, which &s;ubject the Offender to the Lo&s;s of Life, the Re&s;traint of Liberty, or the Payment of a di&s;cretionary Fine, the Law is abundantly careful, in that it interpo&s;es be|tween the Complaint and the Trial of the Offence, an Inquiry into the Nature and Motives of the Pro&s;ecution; to the End, that if le&s;s than probable Evidence &s;hall be produced in Support of it, the Per&s;on ac|cu&s;ed &s;hall be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by your Return of Ignoramus. In the&s;e Pre&s;entments of a Grand Jury, con&s;i&s;ting generally of twenty-three Per&s;ons, a Majority mu&s;t concur, from whence it follows, that before a Per&s;on can be convicted on a criminal Charge, two Juries mu&s;t pa&s;s upon him, making toge|ther twenty-four Per&s;ons; the one to repel frivolous, vexatious, and malicious Com|plaints, the other to review &s;uch as have re|ceived your Sanction, admitting in Evidence and Argument every po&s;&s;ible Circum&s;tance of Exculpation.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">I have further to inform you, that an In|dictment or Pre&s;entment by a Grand Inque&s;t is no Part of the Trial of the Offence, but merely an Information or Declaration for the King: <Q>&startq;For were the Indictment Part of the Trial, then ought he that is noble and a Lord of Parliament to be indicted by his Peers; whereas the Indictment of Peers of the Realm is always by Freeholders, and not &endq;by their Peers.</Q> I cite this as the Opinion and expre&s;s Declaration of one of the able&s;t Lawyers that ever filled the Seat of Ju&s;tice in this Country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">III In&s;titut. 26.

<P>In the earlier Times, the Judges and Law|yers held a Diver&s;ity of Opinions re&s;pec|ting the Crime of High-Trea&s;on; many Offences being then included under that Denomination, which the Law has &s;ince thought proper to reject. At this Day the &s;everal Kinds of Offences that con&s;titute this Crime &s;tand enumerated in a Statute of the 25th of <HI>Edw.</HI> III. which, as it is the only legal Te&s;t of Trea&s;on, has ever been looked upon as the Subject's great Security: Among other Acts of Violence it is thereby expre&s;sly declared to be <Q>&startq;High-Trea&s;on to levy War again&s;t our Lord the King in his Realm, or to be adherent to his Enemies in his &endq;Realm:</Q> <Q>Upon the former of which Clau&s;es the uniform Determination of the Judges has been, &startq;that tho&s;e who make an In&s;urrection, in order to redre&s;s a Public Grievance, whether it be a real or pre|tended one, and of their own Authority attempt with Force to redre&s;s it, are &s;aid to levy War again&s;t the King, although they have no direct De&s;ign again&s;t his Per|&s;on; ina&s;much as they in&s;olently invade his Prerogative, by attempting to do that

Not to mention the various Methods of privately &s;tealing from Per&s;ons in the Streets or in Public A&s;&s;emblies, our Humanity is affected by the Con&s;ideration that, in the Villages adjacent to the Metro|polis, &s;carce any one re&s;ident therein, be his Condition ever &s;o low, can call any Thing his own: and that this is truly the Ca&s;e, who needs to be told who &s;ees po&s;ted up in every Country Retirement, a Caution importing no le&s;s than the Lo&s;s of a Limb to him who &s;hall attempt the &s;tealing from thence a favourite Plant, Fruit, perhaps un|ripe, or it may be a Handful of Flowers?

into Poi&s;on. By Means of Perjury the innocent are condemned, and the guilty &s;uffered to go free; and upon this Offence I cannot omit to point out to you an Ob&s;er|vation that has frequently occurred to me in the Exerci&s;e of my Office of a Magi&s;trate, namely, that in giving Evidence, Men fre|quently practi&s;e a Sort of Ca&s;ui&s;try, which they think ab&s;olves them from the Guilt of Perjury, di&s;tingui&s;hing in their own Minds between &s;wearing to the Hurt, or for the Benefit of another; and I have known a Witne&s;s, for Fear of incurring the Guilt of Perjury, &s;cruple &s;wearing to the Per&s;on of an Offender, in Order to his Conviction; who I have been per&s;uaded, to exculpate him, would not have he&s;itated fal&s;ely to depo&s;e, that at the Time of committing the Offence the Per&s;on charged was &s;leeping in his Bed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Very little &s;hort of the Ca&s;e here &s;uppo&s;ed, was the fol|lowing one of an Offender, a few Years ago tried before me at the <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> Se&s;&s;ion. Some Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers being in Search of &s;muggled Goods, the Mob ro&s;e and re&s;i&s;ted them with a Di&s;charge of Fire Arms; and a Riot en&s;ued.

Forgetting this his Defence before the committing Magi&s;trate, he at his Trial produced a friendly Witne&s;s, who &s;wore, that for a certain Period, commencing and ending with the Riot, the Offender was in his own Room, having locked him&s;elf in; and that he, the Witne&s;s, through the Chinks of an adjoining Apartment, &s;aw him remain there till the Tumult was over. It happened, however, that the committing Magi&s;trate being in Court, produced the Examination taken before him; and, the &s;ame being properly atte&s;ted, and the Evidence of his be|ing active in the Riot appearing full and clear, the Jury found the Offender guilty; and, if I do not mi&s;take, the Court committed the Witne&s;s for the Perjury.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25">Of Nu&s;ances there are many and various Kinds. The&s;e &s;tand oppo&s;ed to private In|juries; and in judicial Proceedings are ever laid as again&s;t the King's Peace, and to the Annoyance of his Subjects. Under this Head are comprehended Ob&s;tructions of the public Highways, Buildings and Erections for the carrying on of noxious Trades and Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, Gaming-Hou&s;es, Places of lewd Re&s;ort, and Places of public Diver&s;ion not licen&s;ed ac|cording to an Act of Parliament, made in the Reign of the late King. The Mi&s;chiefs &s;everally ari&s;ing from the&s;e are obvious; and it is Part of your Duty, as they &s;hall come to your Knowledge, or fall within your Ob|&s;ervation, from Time to Time, to pre&s;ent &s;uch Offences and Places, in order to the Pu|ni&s;hment of tho&s;e Per&s;ons who by Law are made re&s;pon&s;ible for their Act in the one In|&s;tance, and their Conduct in the other.</P>
<P>Affrays and A&s;&s;aults on the Per&s;ons of In|dividuals, though nominally Offences again&s;t the King, and therefore fineable at the Di&s;|cretion of his Ju&s;tices, are, neverthele&s;s, near|ly

In Complaints of this Sort, where the Injury is but &s;mall, the Magi&s;trate, to whom the Complaint is fir&s;t made, cannot better exerci&s;e his Humanity, and I may add, his Wi&s;dom, than by per&s;uading the Parties to Peace and Reconciliation; an Expedient which I have &s;eldom known to fail: yet if he thinks proper to bind the Offender over, your Duty is, upon probable Evidence, to find the Bill.</P>
<P>I will not at this Time trouble you with the particular mention of the many Statutes that have from Time to Time been made for the Support and Encouragement of Religion; nor farther enlarge upon that Topic, than to inform you, that of political In&s;titutions the Wi&s;e&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the Being of a God, the Belief of a Providence that over-rules and directs the Actions of Men, and a future State of Rewards and Puni&s;hments: and as the fulle&s;t Evidence of the&s;e important Truths is con|tained in the &s;acred Writings, the Founders of our excellent Con&s;titution have recognized the Chri&s;tian Religion, and by an Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical E&s;tabli&s;hment declared it to be Part of the Law of the Land.</P>
