<HEAD>THE <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> COMEDY CONSIDER'D and COMPAR'D.</HEAD>
<P>_FROM the Indulgence &s;hewn to my <HI>Treati&s;e on the Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> in which I have con&s;ider'd the Merit of the Tragic Actors only, I have been encouraged to extend that De&s;ign; and now venture to pre&s;ent the Public with my Judgment on &s;uch of their Theatrical Ser|vants, as have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in Comedy.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
But in order to e&s;tabli&s;h my Credit with the Reader, it may not be ami&s;s previou&s;ly to ob|viate an Objection or two, that have been made to my Critici&s;m on the Character of <HI>Lear.</HI></P>
<P>I have been condemned for impeaching Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>'s Manner of clo&s;ing the Cur&s;e, at the End of the Fir&s;t Act, with Tears; and that becau&s;e <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> (who be&s;t knows his own Meaning) has by the following Expre&s;&s;ion dictated &s;uch a Behaviour to the Actor,</P>
<LG>
<L>I am a&s;ham'd,</L>
<L>That thou ha&s;t Power to &s;hake my Manhood thus,</L>
<L>That the&s;e hot Tears, which break from me perforce, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<P>This Ob&s;ervation, <HI>prima facie,</HI> has, I mu&s;t own, a tolerable A&s;pect; but if the&s;e Critics had been a little more minute in their Enqui|ries, they would &s;oon have di&s;covered, that the&s;e Words have no Relation to any Part of the <HI>Anathema,</HI> but allude to a Pa&s;&s;age that im|mediately &s;ucceeds it:
<Q><L>Go, go, my People.</L></Q>
The poor old King, enfeebled by Age, and his
<PB N="5" REF="4">
Spirits almo&s;t exhau&s;ted by the Rage and Vio|lence of the preceding Pa&s;&s;ion, in attempting to recover from the Po&s;ture of Kneeling, &s;tag|gers, and is ready to fall; at that Juncture, re|ceiving the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Attendants, it oc|curs to his Mind, that he is &s;oon to be depri|ved of their Service, and they of his Protection, either of which Reflections are &s;ufficient to alter the Mode of the Mind, render the Tran|&s;ition from Rage to Tenderne&s;s natural, and account for the Pa&s;&s;age that has occa&s;ioned this Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>This Que&s;tion being (I flatter my&s;elf) pretty well &s;ettled, I am at Liberty to pur&s;ue the De&s;ign of the pre&s;ent Treati&s;e, which is to draw a Compari&s;on between Antient and Mo|dern Comedy, and determine to which the Preference is due: To this I &s;hall add &s;ome Ob&s;ervations on the Comic Actors of the pre&s;ent Age.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t De&s;ign of Dramatic Poetry, was to amend the Heart, improve the Under&s;tand|ing, and, at the &s;ame Time, plea&s;e the Imagi|nation. To Tragedy, one Species of the Drama was allotted, the De&s;cription of tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, which, when loo&s;e and ungoverned, are productive of the mo&s;t terrible Con&s;e|quences
<PB N="6" REF="5">
on the one Hand; but if, on the o|ther, they are kept within proper Limits, and chu&s;e Rea&s;on for their Guide and Director, they become highly conducive to the Happi|ne&s;s of Mankind. To Comedy was a&s;&s;igned the Correction of Vices and Follies of an inferior &s;ort.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t In&s;tance, we are taught, by a Collection of fatal Events, to avoid Ruin and Mi&s;ery; in the la&s;t, by a Repre&s;entation of fa&s;hionable Foibles, and particular extrava|gant Humours, to &s;hun Ridicule and Ab&s;ur|dity.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Richard Steele</HI> has apologized for his Mixture of the Tragic with the Comic, by &s;aying, that there is a &s;ort of Di&s;tre&s;s too mean for Tragedy, and which (as it would be cruel to deprive the World of &s;uch u&s;eful Le&s;&s;ons) ought to have a Place in Comedy.</P>
<P>Did Tragedy owe its E&s;&s;ence to the Adven|tures and Misfortunes of People in High Life only, Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s Argument might have &s;ome Weight: But it is the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, not the Si|tuations of Mankind, that are its Objects: If the Incidents are truly intere&s;ting, and the
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Story affecting the Rank and Quality of the <HI>Per|&s;onae</HI> are of no great Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Suffer me now to direct your Ob&s;ervation to tho&s;e among&s;t the Antients, who are mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for their Skill and Excellence in Dramatic Poetry. As <HI>Sophocles, Euripides,</HI> and <HI>Seneca,</HI> are the Chiefs of the Epic, &s;o are <HI>Ari|&s;tophanes, Moenander, Plautus,</HI> and <HI>Terence,</HI> a|mong&s;t the Comic.</P>
<P>It was the Practice of the Comic Poets, till the Time of <HI>Moenander,</HI> to expo&s;e on the Stage, by real Names, &s;uch of their Fellow-Citizens as had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves for any emi|nent Vice or Folly: But the univer&s;al Cor|ruption and Degeneracy of &s;ub&s;equent Ages, having rendered that Cu&s;tom both u&s;ele&s;s and dangerous, <HI>Moenander</HI> introduced the Method of expo&s;ing real Vices by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of feigned Characters. But as the Works of this Author have fallen a Sacrifice to Barbari&s;m and Ignorance, we are obliged to the Confe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Terence,</HI> and the Ob&s;ervations of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> for all the Knowledge we have of his Excellence. And if the Judgment of the latter may be relied on, <HI>Moenander</HI> was happy in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every Requi&s;ite that can delight and improve an Age.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
<HI>Terence</HI> has been &s;aid to be but a &s;ervile Copier of this <HI>Greek</HI> Writer; but as the Co|medies of the latter are lo&s;t, we have a Right to treat the former as an Original, e&s;pecially as he is propo&s;ed by our own Critics, who de&s;pi&s;e and decry all modern Productions.</P>
<P><Q><L>Non quia Cra&s;&s;&ecirc; illepideve putetur</L>
<L>Sed quia nuper,</L></Q>
as the Standard of Dramatic Perfection: But as I have not all that Veneration for Antiquity, I &s;hall take the Liberty to examine his Works with the &s;ame Freedom, as if he had lived but in the Days of <HI>Dryden;</HI> and if upon Enquiry I can di&s;cover, that any Writer of our own Time has excelled him, I &s;hall pay him the &s;ame Honour, as if he and <HI>Homer</HI> had been Cotem|poraries. Were I not appri&s;ed of the ridicu|lous Methods made u&s;e of by tho&s;e who are appointed to in&s;truct the Youth of this Nation in the Dead Languages, I &s;hould be a&s;toni&s;hed at the ab&s;urd Pre-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and Prejudices that mo&s;t Men entertain in Favour of the antient Writers.</P>
<P>A Cla&s;&s;ic is read only to be admired, a Mo|dern Writer only to be condemned. I believe
<PB N="9" REF="8">
I have more rea&s;on to blame this unaccountable Partiality, than mo&s;t Men; for to it I owe two Corrections in one Day, in the Morning I was jerk'd for reading a Comedy of <HI>Congreve</HI>'s, and in the Afternoon was again turn'd up for not being prepared in a bawdy Scene, between the two Maids in the Eunuch of <HI>Terence.</HI> If then in my Enquiry into the Rea&s;ons, why what is wrong in one Writer, &s;hould be &s;anctified in another, I betray any Bitterne&s;s or Ill-nature, I hope the Reader will lay the Defect of my Brain to the Fault of my B&mdash;, for I
<Q><L>Cannot but remember &s;uch things were,</L>
<L>And were mo&s;t grievous to me.</L></Q>
But to our Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Terence</HI> (as I have before ob&s;erved) is &s;aid to have pirated all his Plots and Characters from <HI>Moenander;</HI> nor has <HI>Plautus</HI> le&s;s Obligation to the <HI>Greek</HI> Writers than <HI>Terence;</HI> but as their Geniu&s;es were different, they have been &s;ucce&s;s|ful in different Imitations.</P>
<P><HI>Plautus,</HI> from the luxuriant Plea&s;antry of his Imagination, has been mo&s;t happy in hit|ting the Humour, or <HI>vis comica,</HI> of his Ma&s;ter. <HI>Terence,</HI> from the Correctne&s;s of his Judgment,
<PB N="10" REF="9">
and Cha&s;tity of his Manner; mo&s;t fortunate in the Conduct of his Plot, and Purity of his Dialogue. But as this Gentleman is the cri|tical Bell-weather, let us be a little more mi|nute in our Enquiries after him. And fir&s;t for his Fable.</P>
<P>There is &s;uch a tire&s;ome Samene&s;s in the Plots and Incidents of <HI>Terence,</HI> that the Man who has read his fir&s;t Comedy, may be fairly &s;aid to have read them all.</P>
<P>Nor is he le&s;s barren in his Characters. Two doating old Fools have a Brace of &s;en&s;ele&s;s Cubs for their Sons; the latter have a &s;mart Servant allowed them, who has Wit enough to gull the old Gentlemen, and direct the young ones: A Girl, who oftentimes exi&s;ts in Name only, is the Object of young Ma&s;ters Affecti|ons; but coming from the Lord knows where, and being the Lord knows who, why the Marriage is either impeded, or el&s;e great Per|plexity and Di&s;traction re&s;ults from it; but, however, it turns out at la&s;t, by the Means of a Nur&s;e, that Mi&s;s is a Citizen, a Friend's Daughter, perhaps; &s;o the Ca&s;ket and Trin|kets are produc'd, and all Matters made ea&s;y. This is the general Plan and Plot: And as to what is called Humour in Comedy, the
<PB N="11" REF="10">
be&s;t Half of <HI>Moenander,</HI> I can only &s;ay with <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI>
<Q><L>Utinam ut adjuncta.</L></Q></P>
<P>And here it may not be improper to exa|mine, what is, or ought to be meant, by the Words <HI>Characters of Humours.</HI></P>
<P>There is &s;carce a Play-follower, or Dabler in Critici&s;m, but has that Expre&s;&s;ion con&s;tantly in his Mouth; and yet not one in five hundred of them, has a determinate Idea of what it means; &s;ome mi&s;take Wit for it, others Buf|foonry, &amp;c. &amp;c. Perhaps my Judgment may be as wrong as theirs, but as it will a&s;&s;i&s;t my pre&s;ent Enquiries, give me Leave to be ab&s;o|lute in my Definition of, and Di&s;tinction be|tween, the Humouri&s;t, and Man of Hu|mour.</P>
<P>In my Sen&s;e, then, the&s;e Characters &s;hould be never &s;eparated: The fir&s;t is the Per&s;on to be expo&s;ed, and that by the Means and A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the la&s;t; the latter we laugh with, but at the former.</P>
<P>The Humouri&s;t is a Man, who, from &s;ome Extravagance, or Di&s;ea&s;e of the Mind, is al|ways
<PB N="12" REF="11">
&s;aying or doing &s;omething ab&s;urd and ri|diculous; but at the &s;ame Time is firmly per|&s;uaded, that his Actions and Expre&s;&s;ions are exactly proper and right. And &s;o ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite is this la&s;t Circum&s;tance, to the Con|&s;titution of a Humouri&s;t, that a very elegant and judicious Writer, has made it the Mark by which you are to di&s;tingui&s;h him; as R$dicule (&s;ays he) is the Te&s;t of Truth, &s;o is Gravity of Humour.</P>
<P>The Man of Humour, on the other Hand, is always joyous and plea&s;ant; the Humouri&s;t is his Food; like the Carrion and Crow, they are never a&s;under; it is to the Labour and Plea&s;antry of the former, that you are in|debted for all the Entertainment you meet with in the latter.</P>
<P>That this Hypothe&s;is may not appear alto|gether groundle&s;s, ca&s;t yout Eye on <HI>Lappet</HI> and the <HI>Mi&s;er,</HI> on <HI>Gnatho</HI> and <HI>Thra&s;o,</HI> almo&s;t the only Character of Humour in the Author be|fore us, and then tell me, whether you are not obliged for your Knowledge of, and Laughter at, the Curmudgeon and <HI>Miles Glorio&s;us,</HI> to the Addre&s;s and Skill of the pert Chamber|maid, and ob&s;equious artful Conduct of the Flatterer.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
If, then, this be an accurate Account of the Characters in que&s;tion, you mu&s;t be content to go without them in all the Plays of <HI>Terence,</HI> except the <HI>Eunuch</HI> and <HI>Heautontimorum$nos,</HI> and depend on Plot, Incident, and Language, for your Entertainment.</P>
<P>Our next Search mu&s;t mu&s;t be into the Ex|cellence of <HI>Terence</HI>'s Dialogue; and here, I believe, we mu&s;t agree with <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> that he is,
<Q><L>Puri &s;ermonis amator;</L></Q>
that is, that he is elegant in his Diction, cha&s;te in his Expre&s;&s;ion, and, if it be any Merit in the Writer of a living Language, gramatically ju&s;t.</P>
<P>I don't know whether this Ob&s;ervation or Objection (call it which you will) be ju&s;t, but I can't help thinking, that we Moderns have improved on this chief Excellence of the <HI>Latin</HI> Poet. Pray can you di&s;tingui&s;h any great Difference in his Dialogue? Is not the Lan|guage of the one, the Language of all? If there be any Difference, the polite Side is in Favour of the Servant: However, as <HI>Terence</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="13">
him&s;elf was but a <HI>Libertus,</HI> this Partiality may be pardonable.</P>
<P>I think I can di&s;cern in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Poets a Unity of Dialogue, unattended to by the An|tients. I cannot conceive that you may ex|change one &s;ingle Word in the humourous Character of <HI>Vanburgh,</HI> for a better: Each Man has a Language peculiar to him&s;elf, and what indeed is the Language of that Character in the World.</P>
<P>I can't &s;ay, the Manners of our Comedies are altogether &s;o cha&s;te as tho&s;e of <HI>Terence;</HI> but this may, in a great Mea&s;ure, depend on the different Ta&s;tes of different Ages; and though I own a Poet's Views &s;hould not be con|fined to the narrow Limits of his own Time or Country; yet as it has been generally the Mi&s;|fortune of the&s;e Gentlemen to want &s;omething more &s;ub&s;tantial than Applau&s;e, their Poverty mu&s;t be their Apology.</P>
<P>Of even this Circum&s;tance do different Ages judge differently. A young Lady &s;quawling out behind the Scenes, in the extreme Pangs of Labour, did not &s;hock the Delicacy of the <HI>Roman</HI> Matrons, but was a modern Poet to in|troduce a
<Q><PB N="15" REF="14">
<L>Juno Lucina fer opem,</L></Q>
I very much doubt, whether that &s;ingle In|cident would not damn his whole Piece.</P>
<P>I think I can rai&s;e an Objection or two to the extreme Cha&s;tity of this Writer: The
<Q><L>Quid tum fatue,</L></Q>
after the De&s;cription of the &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Eunuch</HI>'s preparing to commit a Rape, is very near as expre&s;&s;ive, as the Relation it&s;elf would have been; at lea&s;t the Imagination has a pretty good Subject to work upon: A double En|tendre may be neglected, but that Mind mu&s;t be phlegmatic indeed, that does not proceed beyond the <HI>tum,</HI> and gue&s;s at the &s;ub&s;equent Behaviour of the lu&s;ty <HI>&s;oever.</HI> And, pray, what is your Judgment of the Chambermaid's <HI>Nihil Po&s;&s;e,</HI> in her De&s;cription of a Eu|nuch.</P>
<P>But, however, as it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that the Audience &s;hould be acquainted with the &s;everal Circum&s;tances that compo&s;e the a|bove Scene, I believe few Writers would have
<PB N="16" REF="15">
expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame Thoughts, with the &s;ame Delicacy; therefore let <HI>Terence</HI> enjoy a Reputa|tion which our modern Poets (by their Prac|tice) don't envy him.</P>
<P>But before I quit this Author, I ought, in common Ju&s;tice, to take notice of a Charact|er, which though not ab&s;olutely complete, yet is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome Qualities, that were it o|riginal, would give the Writer a Rank, which his Cotemporaries have thought fit to deny him.</P>
<P>The Character I mean, is the <HI>Thra&s;o</HI> of the <HI>Eunuch.</HI> The Out-lines of this Character are the &s;ame with the <HI>Miles Glorio&s;us</HI> of <HI>Plautus,</HI> and the <HI>Bully-Back</HI> of <HI>Congreve:</HI> And though I mu&s;t confe&s;s, in the general Conduct of the Characters. he is excelled by both his Rivals, yet in one In&s;tance, he is at lea&s;t equal to ei|ther of them.</P>
<P><HI>Thra&s;o,</HI> in Con&s;equence of a Pre&s;ent made to a Courte&s;an, called <HI>Thais,</HI> was, by Com|pact, entitled to the &s;ole and undi&s;turbed Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of that Lady for three Days.</P>
<P><HI>Phoedria,</HI> the fine Gentleman of the Comedy, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Per&s;on, and &s;till pre&s;erved the
<PB N="17" REF="16">
Affection of <HI>Thais.</HI> At his Reque&s;t the Cap|tain was excluded before the expiration of his Term; in order to revenge this In&s;ult, <HI>Thra&s;o</HI> martials all his Dome&s;tics, from <HI>Gnatho</HI> to the Scullion, and leads them to attack the Man&s;ion of <HI>Thais,</HI> from whom he intends, by Force, to recover the Girl he had given her.</P>
<P>But as from a Recital of this Pa&s;&s;age, we can &s;carce do Ju&s;tice to the Merit of the Author, and I don't recollect, that the Spirit of this Scene has been pre&s;erved by any of his Tran&s;lators, I &s;hall take the Liberty to pre&s;ent you with my Conception of the whole Inci|dent.</P>

<P>The Cowardice and Vanity of this Behaviour and Expre&s;&s;ion, are as &s;trong and delicate Marks of Character, as can be met with in any Writer; to which if you add the blu&s;tering Behaviour of <HI>Thra&s;o</HI> before the Entrance of <HI>Thais,</HI> and the Pu&s;illanimity and Cowardice of his &s;ub&s;equent Conduct, I believe that you will confe&s;s, that the whole Scene is &s;upported with great Spirit, Propriety, and Humour.</P>
<P>I have now fini&s;hed my Ob&s;ervations on <HI>Te|rence,</HI> and &s;hall ha&s;ten to an Examination of tho&s;e Writers of this Nation, who are &s;uppo&s;ed capable of contending for the Palm with this Hero of Antiquity. With which then &s;hall I begin, with <HI>Shake&s;pear, John&s;on,</HI> or tho&s;e of later Date? Or &s;uppo&s;e, as our Comic Geni$ are &s;o various, we were fir&s;t to enumerate the &s;everal Rules required in a Comedy, and op|po&s;e (occa&s;ionally) our own Writers to each o|ther, and all to the Antients.</P>
<P>To begin then with the Unities of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> which regard Time, Place, and Action; to
<PB N="20" REF="19">
which we have added another, di&s;regarded by the Writers of other Countries, Unity of Cha|racter.</P>
<P>The Rules pre&s;cribed by the&s;e Unities are, that your Time be limited to a natural Day; your Place unchanged; and your Action &s;ingle. The fourth Unity requires, that your Character be pre&s;erved to the End in every Circum&s;tance; and that he neither &s;ay, or do, any thing that might as well have been &s;aid, or done, by any other Per&s;on of the Play.</P>
<P>As to the Unities of Time, Place, and Action, I cannot &s;ay that we have &s;trictly attended to them, unle&s;s in &s;ome particular In&s;tances; &s;uch as the <HI>Alchymi&s;t,</HI> and mo&s;t of the Plays of <HI>John&s;on, Shake&s;pear</HI>'s <HI>Merry Wives of Wind&s;or;</HI> to which I might add &s;ome others; but, in ge|neral, the&s;e Bonds do not hit the Ta&s;te and Genius of the free-born luxuriant Inhabitants of this I&s;le: They will no more bear a Yoke in Poetry than Religion.</P>
<P>No political nor critical Monarch &s;hall give Laws to them: They have indeed &s;ometimes given Proofs, that they do not de&s;pi&s;e the&s;e Mandates of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> becau&s;e it is not in their Capacity to comply with them, but becau&s;e

<P>I do not believe, that it ever was in the Power of Man, to furni&s;h out a more elegant, plea&s;ing, and intere&s;ting Entertainment, than <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> has, in many In&s;tances, given us, without ob&s;erving any one Unity, but that of Character; his adhering to that alone, with the Variety of his Incidents, the Propriety of his Sentiments, the Luxuriancy of his Fancy, and the Purity and Strength of his Dialogue, have produced, in one In&s;tance alone, more Matter for Delight and In&s;truction, than can be collected from all the &s;tarv'd, &s;trait-lac'd Brats, that e|very other Bard has produc'd. Can then our Contempt and Re&s;entment be too &s;trongly ex|pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t that in&s;olent <HI>French</HI> Panegyri&s;t, who fir&s;t denies <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> almo&s;t every Dra|matic Excellence, and then, in his next Play, pilfers from him almo&s;t every capital Scene.

<P>The next Requi&s;ite, to an Ob&s;ervation of the Unities, (if we allow it a Requi&s;ite) is the <HI>&s;ine qua non,</HI> the E&s;&s;ence of Comedy, Hu|mour; and in this Particular we &s;tand un|rival'd; no Nation has more Comedies, no Co|medies more diver&s;ified humourous Characters.</P>
<P>This may indeed, in a great Mea&s;ure, be owing to the Nature of our Con&s;titution, and the Complection of our Inhabitants.</P>
<P>In <HI>France,</HI> one Coxcomb is the Repre&s;enta|tion of the whole Kingdom. In <HI>England</HI> &s;carce any two are alike. I don't know but this Va|riety of Humour may, in a great Mea&s;ure, de|rive its Source from Vanity. Property, with us, is &s;o equally diffu&s;ed, that the Di&s;tinctions ari&s;ing from it are very trifling. In order then to procure a Pre-eminence, we have re|cour&s;e to particular Singularities, which, though at fir&s;t affected, are at la&s;t by Habit &s;o clo&s;ely rivited to the Mind, as to make it impo&s;&s;ible for the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or ever to dive&s;t him&s;elf of it.</P>

No Writer more abounds with Characters of this Ca&s;t, than <HI>Congreeve;</HI> and had his Execu|tion been equal to his Imagination, he would have had a ju&s;t Title to be rank'd with the foremo&s;t of our Comic Poets. All his Hu|mouri&s;ts are well &s;ketch'd, and generally well begun, but ill conducted. The Author, from an Impatience to &s;how his own Wit, throws it into the Mouths of Characters, who are not, in Propriety, entitled to an Atom.</P>
<P>And this is, indeed, the Failing of all young Writers: They jump at the Shadow, and lo&s;e the Sub&s;tance: The main Article is neglected, and their Pur&s;uit directed after Point, An|tithe&s;is, and, what is called, fine Wri|ting.</P>
<P>Wit is not what it has been by many ima|gined to be, the E&s;&s;ence of Comedy; &s;o far from it, that it is of no U&s;e, but as it is &s;ub|&s;ervient to Character.</P>
<P>And from this Mi&s;take it happens, that the Quality which chiefly recommends the Works of Mr. <HI>Congreeve,</HI> to the Ob&s;ervation of the Million, is the very Circum&s;tance that di|mini&s;hes

his Excellence with the Judici|ous.</P>
<P>Our next Enquiry mu&s;t be directed after the Plots and Incidents of the Moderns: And in the&s;e In&s;tances we are as various as in our Cha|racters.</P>
<P>There &s;eems to have been always a Trial of Skill among&s;t the Antients, which &s;hould write be&s;t on the &s;ame Subject. The Story of <HI>Me|dea, Hercules,</HI> &amp;c. are the Objects of all their Tragedies. Their Want of Variety in Comedy I have before objected to.</P>
<P>That the Antients were more cha&s;te in the Conduct of their Plots, I &s;hall readily allow. Immoralities of all kinds have met with a favourable a Reception on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage, <HI>Collier</HI>'s Complaint was but too ju&s;t. The Want of Decency, both of Expre&s;&s;ion and Action, is an Objection that may with Ju&s;tice be made to even our be&s;t Comedies. There are &s;ome kinds of Vice that it is impro|per to exhibit, though with a View of puni&s;h|ing. What kind of Apology then can be made for tho&s;e Writers, who have not only been &s;o imprudent as to introduce it, but, at the &s;ame time, have dared to reward it.</P>

The mo&s;t blameable of all our Play-writers in this In&s;tance, are <HI>Congreeve</HI> and <HI>Vanburgh.</HI> Nay, the latter, as if di&s;tru&s;ting his own Ta|lents for the Advancement of Wickedne&s;s, has called in to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the mo&s;t immoral Play that ever di&s;graced the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage, the <HI>Confederacy</HI> of <HI>Dancour;</HI> in which all the Men are Rogues, and all the Women as bad. The principal Per&s;onage is the Son of a Bawd, who after having robbed his Mother, impo&s;ed him|&s;elf on the World in a fictitious Character, and committed Actions which had de&s;ervedly doom|ed him to the Gallows, is at la&s;t made happy in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great Beauty and For|tune.</P>
<P>The Moral of this pretty Piece is, then, that be di&s;obedient, di&s;hone&s;t, or any thing but vir|tuous, and you &s;hall not fail of being re|warded.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Digre&s;&s;ions have drawn me beyond my purpos'd Length; I &s;hall therefore clo&s;e my Ob&s;ervations with a few general Remarks on the peculiar Excellencies of our principal Comic Writers.</P>

<HI>Ben John&s;on</HI> is mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in his Plots, <HI>Congreeve</HI> in his Characters, and <HI>Vanburgh</HI> in his Dialogue. The former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed mo&s;t Know|ledge and Judgment, the &s;econd mo&s;t Fancy and Fire, the la&s;t mo&s;t Propriety, Ea&s;e, and Elegance. The fir&s;t, in order to pre&s;erve Cor|rectne&s;s, was often flat; <HI>Congreeve,</HI> too roving and unconfin'd; and, <HI>Vanburgh,</HI> too immoral. Dive&s;t this la&s;t Writer of this Failing, and his Comedies are unexceptionably the be&s;t in the Language.</P>
<P>I ought to make &s;ome Apology for my &s;i|lence with regard to <HI>Wycherly, Otway, Farquar,</HI> and <HI>Cibber;</HI> but as the&s;e Writers po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame Beauties and Errors in common with tho&s;e already mentioned, it will be unnece&s;&s;ary to trouble you with a particular De&s;cription of their Works; I &s;hall therefore clo&s;e this Trea|ti&s;e, but not before I have paid my Tribute to the Geuius of an Author, who&s;e fir&s;t Pro|duction has given him a Claim to be rank'd in the fir&s;t Cla&s;s.</P>
<P>It will (I doubt not) be often mentioned by $uture Generations, that in the Year 1746, Dr. <HI>Hoadley</HI> produc'd a Comedy, called the <HI>Su&s;picious Hu&s;band;</HI> in which he has found Means to give

the highe&s;t Delight, without having recour&s;e to the low u&s;ual Arts of Bawdy and Buf|foonry.</P>
<P>But that we may not appear tainted with the common Partiality that generally attends No|velty, let us venture at the Di&s;covery of tho&s;e Qualities in this Piece, which have recommend|ed it to the general Favour of the Public, and have obtained for it our particular Appro|bation.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, then, mo&s;t of the Cha|racters are real, the Incidents are intere&s;ting, the Cata&s;trophe affecting, and the Language pure, &s;pirited, and natural.</P>
<P>The Character of Mr. <HI>Strickland,</HI> (who names the Play) is as well drawn and &s;upport|ed, as any I have met with: And among&s;t the Scenes which the Author has de&s;igned to ridicule the Folly and Ab&s;urdity of Su&s;picion, none &s;eems &s;o well calculated for the Purpo&s;e, as that where <HI>Strickland</HI> is de&s;irous, and yet a|fraid, of engaging one of his Dome&s;tics in the Service of his Pa&s;&s;ion: The Perplexity at which he &s;hall tru&s;t, or whether he &s;hall tru&s;t either; with the Doubts, Re&s;olutions, He&s;i|tations, on that Occa&s;ion, make up &s;o natural
<PB N="28" REF="27">
and comic a De&s;cription of that Di&s;ea&s;e of the Mind, that the Play, on this Account only, de&s;erves the highe&s;t Encomiums.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Strickland</HI> is de&s;cribed as &s;uch a Wo|man ought to be, in order to render the Hu&s;|band's extravagant Humour without Excu&s;e. Her Innocence, joined to her other amiable Qualities, intere&s;t the Audience &s;trongly in her Favour, and place the Pa&s;&s;ion of Jealou&s;y in a more hated and ridiculous Light.</P>
<P>The two fine Gentlemen of this Comedy, are not (as I can perceive) different from the fine Gentlemen of other Writers: They laugh, &s;ing, &s;ay good. Things, and are in Love.</P>
<P>The Rake is a lively Portrait of that Cha|racter in Life. His Errors ari&s;e from the want of Reflection; a lively Imagination, with a great Flow of Spirits, hurries him into all the fa&s;hionable Follies of the Town; but throw the lea&s;t &s;hadow of Wickedne&s;s or Di&s;honour on an Action, and he avoids it with the &s;ame Care that he would a Precipice.</P>
<P>The natural good Qualities of this Youth, obtain for him on the Stage the &s;ame Indul|gence
<PB N="29" REF="28">
that attends him in the World: We are blind to his Foibles, entertained with his Ad|ventures, and wi&s;h to &s;ee (in which, I &s;uppo&s;e, by the Conduct of the Author, we are wrong) the wild Rogue reclaim'd.</P>
<P>I &s;at (the fir&s;t Night this Comedy was ex|hibited) by a plain, hone&s;t, well-meaning Ci|tizen, who&s;e Imagination was &s;trongly po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Incidents of the Play. At drop|ping of the Curtain, I could not help com|plaining to my Neighbour, that I was di&s;plea&s;ed at &s;eeing <HI>Ranger</HI> go off as he came on. Could not, &s;aid I, the Author throw this Youth, in the Cour&s;e of his Nocturnal Rambles, into &s;ome ridiculous Scene of Di&s;tre&s;s, which might, with Propriety, have reclaim'd him. But, as he now &s;tands, who knows but the Rogue, af|ter all the Plea&s;ure he has given us, may &s;pend the Night in a Round-Hou&s;e. By G&mdash;d! &s;ays the Cit, if it happens in my Ward, I'll relea&s;e him; for I'm &s;ure he is too hone&s;t a Fellow to run away from his Bail.</P>
<P>The amiable Light in which this Character appears, will, I am afraid, draw many a <HI>Tem|plar</HI> into trouble&s;ome Scrapes. I have now no le&s;s than ten Friends, &s;ince the Appearance of <HI>Ranger,</HI> who are under Pro&s;ecutions for ravi&s;h|ing
<PB N="30" REF="29">
Ki&s;&s;es from Girls in the Street, and beating the Watch: It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to let the&s;e &s;prightly Boys know, that the&s;e are not the Particulars of <HI>Ranger</HI>'s Character that procure our Regard; we are only tempted to overlook the&s;e Blemi&s;hes in his Conduct, on the &s;core of &s;ome amiable Beauties.</P>
<P>But that we may not appear partial to the Productions of this Author, let us take a View of &s;uch of his Characters, as appear liable to Exception.</P>
<P>That the Critics, then, might not be de|prived of their daily Food, the Poet has thrown them a Couple of Characters to nibble at, the Coquet, and the Coxcomb.</P>
<P>The la&s;t is of a Species pretty common a|mong&s;t us, but hitherto neglected. The Im|portation of Fopperies from <HI>France,</HI> we have laughed at till we are tir'd: Our Author was willing to &s;ee whether <HI>Italy</HI> could not furni&s;h us with a Fool, as ridiculous and diverting as her Neighbour; and had the Character in Que&s;tion been &s;upported with the &s;ame Spirit that it is begun, I doubt not but we &s;hould have been fully &s;atisfied: But no &s;ooner has this merry Gentleman rai&s;ed our Attention, but he &s;lips
<PB N="31" REF="30">
through our Fingers like an Eel, and we hear no more of him. Mr. <HI>Meggot</HI> does, in Truth, &s;urvive the Lo&s;s of his Monkey, but he never forgets his Affection &s;o far, as to be tolerable Company after.</P>
<P>I did indeed flatter my&s;elf with the Hopes of &s;eeing that Gentleman intere&s;ted in the Conduct of the Play, and every Minute expect|ed to find my Friend <HI>Ranger</HI> very joco&s;e upon his Foible.</P>
<P>But whether the Author did not chu&s;e to ex|po&s;e &s;o good natur'd a Fellow, or was above being obliged to any Nation but his own, for the Entertainment he was to give us, <HI>Jackey Meggot</HI> is of very little more Con&s;equence in the <HI>Su&s;picious Hu&s;band,</HI> than is Lieutenant <HI>Story</HI> in the <HI>Committee.</HI></P>
<P>The next Character for the Snarlers to mumble is <HI>Clarinda.</HI></P>
<P>This Lady, at the opening of the Play, would put her&s;elf upon us for a fini&s;h'd Coquet; but &s;he does it &s;o aukardly, that few of us are impo&s;ed upon; &s;he is, indeed, at fir&s;t a little waggi&s;h with <HI>Jacintha,</HI> about giving Ea&s;e, &amp;c. but this was only a Copy of her Countenance,
<PB N="32" REF="31">
for I dont't find but &s;he is as ready to &s;atisfy the De&s;ires of her Lover (in an honourable Way) as the other.</P>
<P>But all this while are not we impo&s;ing on our|&s;elves? How are we &s;ure that Dr. <HI>Hoadley</HI> in|tended <HI>Clarinda</HI> for a Coquet? Indeed &s;he &s;ome|times talks like one, but her Actions are di|rectly oppo&s;ite; and as I, for my own Part, chu&s;e to rely more on the latter, than the for|mer, I &s;$$n't &s;cruple to pronounce, that this Lady is no more a Coquet than <HI>Jacintha.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;everal Objections at the Per&s;onages of the Drama being (as far as the Affair will ad|mit of) thus clear'd up, let us attend to a Cavil or two at the Conduct of the Play.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that <HI>Frankley</HI>'s whole Scheme of pur&s;uing <HI>Clarinda,</HI> is borrow'd from the <HI>Eunuch</HI> of <HI>Terence;</HI> and that the Expre&s;&s;ion of, <HI>this I know, wherever &s;he is, &s;he cannot be long unknown,</HI> is a literal Tran&s;lation from the &s;ame Author. Well, and what then? Why do we take &s;uch Pains to create an Intimacy with the ob&s;olete Gentry, if they don't help us out now and then at a dead Lift? The Doctor has been at &s;ome Pains and Expence to &s;ubdue the Meaning of this Cla&s;&s;ic to his own Comprehen&s;ion; and
<PB N="33" REF="32">
has not he a Right, by the Law of Arms, to enjoy the Fruits of his Victory? Pretty Rea&s;on|ing, truly; and &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e you will reckon the Man, who now and then decorates a Pe|riod with a <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Q$otation, a Pla|giary: Why, who the Devil would trouble him&s;elf to acquire tho&s;e Languages, if it were not for the Reputation that Practice procures him? Oh, fie! Be&s;ides, in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, the Doctor was under a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;hewing his Learning. The little Bits of <HI>Latin, Italian,</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> which are here and there &s;cattered through the Play, are not introduced becau&s;e the Poet thought them nece&s;&s;ary, but becau&s;e the World &s;hould know, that it is not a &s;mall Matter of Knowledge that is required towards the Con&s;titution of a Doctor of Phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>But were we to an&s;wer all the trifling Re|marks of the&s;e eternal Cavillers, there would be no End to the Subject; therefore I &s;hall di&s;|mi&s;s them with one general An&s;wer, that I de|fy them to produce a Comedy, &s;ince the Year Twenty-&s;ix, that has a Tithe of the Merit of the <HI>Su&s;picious Hu&s;band.</HI> And though we may be deficient as to the <HI>vis comica,</HI> and our Cha|racters may not be altogether &s;o highly drawn, as might be wi&s;hed, yet, upon the whole, we are at lea&s;t equal to the be&s;t of the <HI>Roman</HI> Co|mic
<PB N="34" REF="33">
Poets, <HI>Terence;</HI> and that is Reputation e|nough to &s;atisfy our Ambition.</P>
<P>We have now given thee, Reader, an accu|rate Account of the public and private Judg|ment on the <HI>Su&s;picious Hu&s;band;</HI> &s;uppo&s;e we were to pre&s;ent thee with our Opinion of the Deportment of the Actors in this Comedy: But as that would interfere with our general De&s;ign, I &s;hall de&s;cend to no farther Particu|lars, than that they (on this Occa&s;ion) excelled them&s;elves; but ha&s;ten to view the Comic Players of the pre&s;ent Age in a more ex|ten&s;ive Light.</P>
<P>But before the&s;e Gentlemen of the Sock are entitled to my Regard, I mu&s;t di&s;charge a Debt due to the Public, and pay their and my Ac|knowledgement to Mrs. <HI>Cibber,</HI> for the Plea&s;ure &s;he has given us in the Bu&s;kin.</P>
<P>This Lady, though by much the younge&s;t Actre&s;s (I mean in point of Experience) on the Stage, has almo&s;t all her Time reign'd un|rival'd in the Hearts of the People. There is a Delicacy in her Deportment, and a &s;en&s;ible Innocence in her Countenance, that never fails to prejudice the Spectator in her Favour, even before &s;he &s;peaks. Nor does Mrs. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s &s;ub|&s;equent
<PB N="35" REF="34">
Behaviour eraze the&s;e fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions. Her Expre&s;&s;ions of the Pa&s;&s;ion of Grief, &s;ur|pa&s;s every thing of the &s;ort that I have &s;een. There is a melancholly Plaintivene&s;s in her Voice, and &s;uch a Dejection of Countenance, (without Di&s;tortion,) that I defy any Man, who has the lea&s;t Drop of the Milk of Human Na|ture about him, to &s;it out the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of <HI>Mo|nimia</HI> and <HI>Belvidera,</HI> when repre&s;ented by this Lady, without giving the mo&s;t tender and affecting Te&s;timonies of his Huma|nity.</P>
<P>Nor has Mrs. <HI>Cibber</HI> le&s;s Force (when &s;he plea&s;es to exert it) in the different Modes of Rage. There is a Wildne&s;s in her A&s;pect, and a Rapidity in her Utterance, that are ad|mirably &s;uited to the Characters of <HI>Con|&s;tance,</HI> in <HI>King John,</HI> and <HI>Alicia</HI> in <HI>Jane Shore.</HI></P>
<P>That Mrs. <HI>Cibber</HI> is now and then languid in the Part of <HI>Cali&s;ta,</HI> may, I am afraid, be attributed to the natural Weakne&s;s of her Con|&s;titution. The Character is of an unu&s;ual Length, and the Pa&s;&s;ions of Rage, Scorn, Grief, and Di&s;appointment, &s;o frequently and for|cibly repeated, that it requires more than a common &s;tock of Health and Spirits, to do
<PB N="36" REF="35">
equal Ju&s;tice to the whole Part. I cannot pre|&s;ume, that Mrs. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Judgment is detective; nor is it le&s;s obvious, that &s;he is happy in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the natural Powers required in this Character: To what then can we attribute the little U&s;e &s;he here makes of tho&s;e Powers, but to the Conciou&s;ne&s;s o&s; weak Lungs, and a bad Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>But lea&s;t the Imitators of Mrs. <HI>Cibber</HI> &s;hould mi&s;take this Deportment of hers, for the Ef|fect of her Judgment, it may not be improper to ob&s;erve, that <HI>Rowe</HI> him&s;elf has recommend|ed a Behaviour to the Player, and that it is her Duty, as near as &s;he can, to an&s;wer and &s;upport the Portrait of <HI>Cali&s;ta,</HI> given to the Audience by <HI>Lothari$</HI> in the fir&s;t Act:</P>
<LG>
<L>Mad as the Prie&s;te&s;s of the Del$hic God,</L>
<L>Enthu&s;i$&s;tic Pa&s;&s;ion &s;well'd her Brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Enlarg'd her Voice, and ruffled all her Form.</L>

<P>Though it may perhaps be deemed hyper|critical to ob&s;erve on trifling Faults, where there are &s;o many glaring Beauties, yet as the&s;e Trifles are ea&s;ily mended, and are, be&s;ides, ap|parent to the mo&s;t &s;uperficial Spectator, I hope I &s;hall have Mrs. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Pardon, if I de&s;ire

<P>I believe I &s;hall ea&s;ily obtain the Reader's Pardon for detaining him a Minute from the Comic Actors, when I tell him, it is to thank Mrs. <HI>Giffard</HI> for the Entertainment &s;he has, in many parts, given both him and me.

<P>And here &s;uffer me to caution the young Actors of both Hou&s;es, that they be not too ra&s;h in the Imitation of Mr. <HI>C</HI>'s. Manner; let them fir&s;t con&s;ult their Abilities. Few People are happy in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a &s;ett of Features. This Gentleman's are formed with &s;uch peculiar Plea&s;antry, that the Specta|tor at &s;urveying them in their natural &s;tate only, is (in the Words of the Commentator
<PB N="40" REF="39">
on Dr. <HI>Middleton)</HI> often &s;truck with an un|expected Ha, ha! For what Mr. <HI>C.</HI> is in|debted to Nature, Mr. <HI>H&mdash;y</HI> is obliged to Accident. This great Comedian was &s;o fortu|nate, as in his Infancy to fall in the Fire, by which Means the left Corner of his Mouth, and the Extremity of his Chin, became very near Neighbours: how often that lucky Circum&s;tance has recommended him to the Approbation of the Sky-parlour Gentry, I &s;ubmit to the Critics on the Ground Floor.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Quin,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Clive,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Pritchard,</HI> are &s;o injudicious as to build their Fame on the Comic Foundation.</P>
<P>I own, I am weak enough to have a Regard for the Judgment of the latter; and therefore as I have an Aver&s;ion to Controver&s;y, and the Di&s;covery of Faults is no very de&s;irable Office, I &s;hall leave the Comical Gentry to the En|joyment of their Opinion, and &s;eek out for &s;ome Particulars in the Comic Actors, which may, at lea&s;t, ju&s;tify my Partiality for them.</P>
<P>To begin with Mr. <HI>Quin.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="40">
Mr. <HI>Quin</HI>'s Deportment, through the whole Ca&s;t of his Characters, is natural and unaffect|ed; his Countenance expre&s;&s;ive, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Grimace; and he is indeed in e|very Circum&s;tance &s;o much the Per&s;on he re|pre&s;ents, that it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for any atten|tive Spectator to believe that the hypocritical intriguing <HI>Ma&s;quell,</HI> the &s;u&s;picious &s;uperan|nuated Rake, the &s;narling old Batchelor, and the jolly joco&s;e <HI>Jack Fal&s;taff,</HI> are imitated, but real Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>And here I wi&s;h I had Room and Abi|lity to point out the &s;everal ma&s;terly Strokes with which Mr. <HI>Quin</HI> has often entertained my Imagination, and &s;atisfied my Judgment; but under my pre&s;ent Confinement, I can only re|commend the Man, who wants to &s;ee a Cha|racter perfectly play'd, to Mr. <HI>Quin,</HI> in the Part of <HI>Fal&s;taff;</HI> and if he does not expre&s;s his De&s;ire of &s;pending an Evening with that merry Mortal, why, I would not &s;pend one with him, if he would pay my Reckoning.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Clive</HI> (the be&s;t Actre&s;s in her Walk, that I, or perhaps any Man living, has &s;een) next claims our Attention. This Lady is pe|culiarly happy in hitting the Humours of Cha|racters
<PB N="42" REF="41">
in low Life. The awkard Forwardne&s;s of a Country Girl, the ridiculous affected Airs of a Lady's Woman, or the pert Behaviour of an intriguing Chambermaid.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Clive</HI> has been a little unhappy in her Choice of &s;ome Parts.</P>
<P>There are Characters in Comedy which re|quire a Delicacy of Figure, and an Elegance of Behaviour; and as both Nature and Habit have denied Mrs. <HI>Clive</HI> the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Requi&s;ites, I would advi&s;e her never to think of per&s;onating a fine Lady of any Kind or Condition, unle&s;s the Author (with a View of rendering the Part ridiculous) has endowed it with &s;ome whim&s;ical Peculiarity.</P>
<P>You have already, Madam, a Ca&s;t of Cha|racters in which your Action will always com|mand the Attention and Applau&s;e of an Au|dience; don't, therefore, &s;uffer an idle Am|bition to de&s;troy that Con&s;equence; which, if you pur&s;ue the Bent of your Genius, you have it &s;till in your Power to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>This Lady has now and then perhaps (owing to an Earne&s;tne&s;s for the Succe&s;s of the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s)
<PB N="43" REF="42">
expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf behind the Scenes in too loud and forcible a Manner.</P>
<P>This Circum&s;tance has (I am afraid) given &s;ome part of the Audience not a very favour|able Opinion of her Temper. But when the Public are a&s;&s;ured, that this Vehemence is a&s;|&s;umed in order to procure a more decent En|tertainment for them&s;elves, I doubt not but they will convert their Re&s;entment to Appro|bation.</P>
<P>The la&s;t, though not the lea&s;t Per&s;on to be con&s;idered, is Mrs. <HI>Pritchard,</HI> who&s;e unblame|able Conduct in private Life, joined to her Theatrical Excellence, has ju&s;tly recommended her to the E&s;teem of the Town.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Pritchard</HI> is peculiarly happy in a good Voice, a plea&s;ing Figure, and a correct Judg|ment.</P>
<P>As Mrs. <HI>Clive</HI>'s Fort con&s;i&s;ts in the Imita|tion of the Foibles and extravagant Humours of the <HI>Beau Monde;</HI> this Lady's Talent lies in the Repre&s;entation of the graceful and be|coming Parts of their Characters. Not but I have &s;een Mrs. <HI>Pritchard</HI> exert her&s;elf with great Pertne&s;s, Propriety, and Spirit, in the
<PB N="44" REF="43">
Part of a waggi&s;h favourite <HI>Abigal;</HI> and have ob&s;erved a Deportment, which I thought ex|tremely engaging in her, when a Lady become extremely ridiculous, when awkardly mimick'd by her as an affected Servant.</P>
<P>But to &s;um up Mrs. <HI>Pritchard</HI>'s Qualities in a few Words, from the various Ca&s;t of her Characters, in all of which &s;he is plea&s;ing, and the Ea&s;ine&s;s of her Di&s;po&s;ition, I would, were I a Pattentee, rather have her in my Service, than any Woman in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I believe I &s;hould with Difficulty obtain the Pardon of the Public, if I neglected to be&s;tow a few Periods on their favourite Servant.</P>
<P>I have &s;een, with infinite Satisfaction, the Days of my Youth reviv'd in the forward, va|cant, romping School-boy of Mr. <HI>Garrick.</HI></P>
<P>Nor have I received le&s;s Plea&s;ure from the &s;imple credulous Conduct and Countenance of <HI>Abel Drugger.</HI></P>
<P>I have, in &s;ome In&s;tances, beheld with ex|qui&s;ite Delight, the ridiculous Rapture of the vain &s;elf-approved Poet; though in others I have mi&s;&s;ed a Gravity of Countenance, and
<PB N="45" REF="44">
Dignity of Deportment, which I have always (though perhaps fal&s;ly) a&s;&s;ociated with my Idea of that &s;olemn and &s;erious Coxcomb.</P>
<P>I think <HI>Garrick</HI>'s Rake a &s;prightly, merry, entertaining Fellow. I can't &s;ay I am fond of cultivating an Acquaintance with his Gentle|men. And as to his Fops, either lively or grave, I have them in utter Abhorrence.</P>
<P>As to the Merit of Mr. <HI>Raftor,</HI> Mr. <HI>C&mdash;b,</HI> Mr. <HI>Collins,</HI> with the long <HI>Et caeteras</HI> of both Theatres, they mu&s;t be content to have the Celebration of their Perfections de|ferred to another Sea&s;on; and I hope the Pur|cha&s;er won't think that I exaggerate the Ex|cellence of the&s;e good People, when I &s;hall rate him for the Whole of it at no more than Three-pence.</P>
