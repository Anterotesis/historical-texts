<HEAD>Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe's
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_AS the De&s;ign of every Thing
is &s;aid to be fir&s;t in the In|tention,
and la&s;t in the
Execution; &s;o I come now
to acknowledge to my Reader, That
the pre&s;ent Work is not merely the
Product of the two fir&s;t Volumes,
but the two fir&s;t Volumes may rather
be called the Product of this: The
Fable is always made for the Moral,
not the Moral for the Fable.</P>
<P>I have heard, that the envious and
ill-di&s;po&s;ed Part of the World have
rais'd &s;ome Objections again&s;t the
two fir&s;t Volumes, on Pretence, <HI>for
want of a better Rea&s;on;</HI> That (<HI>as
they &s;ay</HI>) the Story is feign'd, that
the Names are borrow'd, and that
<PB REF="4">
it is all a Romance; that there never
were any &s;uch Man or Place, or Cir|cum&s;tances
in any Mans Life; that
it is all form'd and embelli&s;h'd by
Invention to impo&s;e upon the World.</P>
<P>I <HI>Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe</HI> being at this
Time in perfect and &s;ound Mind and
Memory, Thanks be to God there|fore;
do hereby declare, their Obje|ction
is an Invention &s;candalous in
De&s;ign, and fal&s;e in Fact; and do
affirm, that the Story, though Alle|gorical,
is al&s;o Hi&s;torical; and that
it is the beautiful Repre&s;entation of a
Life of unexampled Misfortunes, and
of a Variety not to be met with in
the World, &s;incerely adapted to, and
intended for the common Good of
Mankind, and de&s;igned at fir&s;t, <HI>as it
is now farther apply'd,</HI> to the mo&s;t
&s;erious U&s;es po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Farther, that there is a Man alive,
and well known too, the Actions of
who&s;e Life are the ju&s;t Subject of the&s;e
<PB REF="5">
Volumes, and to whom all or mo&s;t
Part of the Story mo&s;t directly alludes,
this may be depended upon for Truth,
and to this I &s;et my Name.</P>
<P>The famous Hi&s;tory of <HI>Don Quixot,</HI>
a Work which thou&s;ands read with
Plea&s;ure, to one that knows the
Meaning of it, was an emblematic
Hi&s;tory of, and a ju&s;t Satyr upon the
Duke <HI>de Medina Sidonia;</HI> a Per&s;on
very remarkable at that Time in <HI>Spain:</HI>
To tho&s;e who knew the Original, the
Figures were lively and ea&s;ily di&s;co|vered
them&s;elves, as they are al&s;o
here, and the Images were ju&s;t; and
therefore, when a malicious, but
fooli&s;h Writer, in the abundance of
his Gall, &s;poke of <HI>the Quixoti&s;m</HI> of
<HI>R. Cru&s;oe,</HI> as he called it, he &s;hewed
evidently, that he knew nothing of
what he &s;aid; and perhaps will be
a little &s;tartled, when I &s;hall tell
him, that what he meant for a
Satyr,
was the greate&s;t of Panegyricks.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
Without letting the Reader into a
nearer Explication of the Matter, I
proceed to let him know, that the
happy Deductions I have employ'd
my&s;elf to make from all the Cir|cum&s;tances
of my Story, will abun|dantly
make him amends for his
not having the Emblem explained
by the Original; and that when in
my Ob&s;ervations and Reflexions of
any Kind in this Volume, I mention
my Solitudes and Retirements, and
allude to the Circum&s;tances of the
former Story, all tho&s;e Parts of the
Story are real Facts in my Hi&s;tory,
whatever borrow'd Lights they may be
repre&s;ented by: Thus the Fright and
Fancies which &s;ucceeded the Story of
the Print of a Man's Foot, and Surpri&s;e
of the old Goat, and the Thing roll|ling
on my Bed, and my jumping
out in a Fright, are all Hi&s;tories and
real Stories; as are likewi&s;e the Dream
of being taken by Me&s;&s;engers, being
<PB REF="7">
arre&s;ted by Officers, the Manner of
being driven on Shore by the Surge of
the Sea, the Ship an Fire, the De&s;crip|tion
of &s;tarving; the Story of my Man
<HI>Friday,</HI> and many more mo&s;t material
Pa&s;&s;ages ob&s;erv'd here, and on which
any religious Reflections are made,
are all hi&s;torical and true in Fact:
It is mo&s;t real, that I had a Parrot,
and taught it to call me by my Name,
&s;uch a Servant a Savage, and after|wards
a Chri&s;tian, and that his Name
was called <HI>Friday,</HI> and that he was
ravi&s;h'd from me by Force, and died
in the Hands that took him, which I
repre&s;ent by being killed; this is all
litterally true, and &s;hould I enter in|to
Di&s;coveries, many alive can te&s;tify
them: His other Conduct and A&s;|&s;i&s;tance
to me al&s;o have ju&s;t Referen|ces
in all their Parts to the Helps I had
from that faithful Savage, in my real
Solitudes and Di&s;a&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB REF="8">
The Story of the Bear in the Tree,
and the Fight with the Wolves in the
Snow, is likewi&s;e Matter of real Hi|&s;tory;
and in a Word, the Adven|tures
of <HI>Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe,</HI> are one
whole Scheme of a real Life of eight
and twenty Years, &s;pent in the
mo&s;t wandring de&s;olate and afflict|ing
Circum&s;tances that ever Man
went through, and in which I have
liv'd &s;o long in a Life of Wonders in
continu'd Storms, fought with the
wor&s;e kind of Savages and Man|eaters,
by unaccountable &s;uppri&s;ing
Incidents; fed by Miracles greater
than that of Ravens, &s;uffered all
Manner of Violences and Oppre&s;|&s;ions,
injurious Reproaches, con|tempt
of Men, Attacks of Devils,
Corrections from Heaven, and Oppo|&s;ions
on Earth; have had innumera|ble
Ups and Downs in Matters of
Fortune, been in Slavery wor&s;e than
<HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> e&s;caped by an exqui&s;ite
<PB REF="9">
Management, as that in the Story of
<HI>Xury,</HI> and the Boat at <HI>Sallee,</HI> been
taken up at Sea in Di&s;tre&s;s, rais'd a|gain
and depre&s;s'd again, and that
oftner perhaps in one Man's life
than ever was known before; Ship|wreck'd
often, tho' more by Land
than by Sea: In a Word, there's not
a Circum&s;tance in the imaginary Sto|ry,
but has its ju&s;t Allu&s;ion to a
real Story, and chimes Part for Part,
and Step for Step with the inimitable
Life of <HI>Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe.</HI></P>
<P>In like Manner, when in the&s;e Re|flections,
I &s;peak of the Times and
Circum&s;tances of particular Actions
done, or Incidents which happened
in my Solitude and I&s;land-Life,
an impartial Reader will be &s;o ju&s;t
to take it as it is; <HI>viz.</HI> that it is &s;po|ken
or intended of that Part of the
real Story, which the I&s;land-Life is a
ju&s;t Allu&s;ion to; and in this the
Story is not only illu&s;trated, but the
<PB REF="10">
real Part I think mo&s;t ju&s;tly approv'd:
<HI>For Example,</HI> in the latter Part of
this Work called the Vi&s;ion, I begin
thus, <HI>When I was in my I&s;land King|dom,
I had abundance of &s;trange
Notions of my &s;eeing Apparitions,</HI>
&amp;c. all the&s;e Reflections are ju&s;t Hi|&s;tory
of a State of forc'd Confine|ment,
which in my real Hi&s;tory is
repre&s;ented by a confin'd Retreat
in an I&s;land; and 'tis as rea&s;onable to
repre&s;ent one kind of Impri&s;onment
by another, as it is to repre&s;ent any
Thing that really exi&s;ts, by that
which exi&s;ts not. The Story of my
Fright with &s;omething on my Bed,
was Word for Word a Hi&s;tory of
what happened, and indeed all tho&s;e
Things received very little Altera|tion,
except what nece&s;&s;arily attends
removing the Scene from one Place
to another.</P>
<P>My Ob&s;ervations upon Solitude
are the &s;ame, and I think I need &s;ay
<PB REF="11">
no more, than that the &s;ame Remark
is to be made upon all the References
made here, to the Tran&s;actions of the
former Volumes, and the Reader is
de&s;ired to allow for it as he goes on.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, here is the ju&s;t and
only good End of all Parable or Al|legorick
Hi&s;tory brought to pa&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI>
for moral and religious Improve|ment.
Here is invincible Patience
recommended under the wor&s;t of
Mi&s;ery; indefatigable Application
and undaunted Re&s;olution under
the greate&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;couraging
Circum&s;tances; I &s;ay, the&s;e are re|commended,
as the only Way to
work through tho&s;e Mi&s;eries, and
their Succe&s;s appears &s;ufficient to
&s;upport the mo&s;t dead-hearted Crea|ture
in the World.</P>
<P>Had the common Way of Writ|ing
a Mans private Hi&s;tory been ta|ken,
and I had given you the Con|duct
or Life of a Man you knew,
<PB REF="12">
and who&s;e Misfortunes and Infirmi|ties,
perhaps you had &s;ometimes un|ju&s;tly
triumph'd over; all I could have
&s;aid would have yielded no Diver|&s;ion,
and perhaps &s;carce have obtain|ed
a Reading, or at be&s;t no Attention;
the Teacher, <HI>like a greater,</HI> having
no Honour in his own Country.
Facts that are form'd to touch the
Mind, mu&s;t be done a great Way off,
and by &s;omebody never heard of:
Even the Miracles of the Ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour
of the World &s;uffered Scorn
and Contempt, when it was reflected,
that they were done by the Carpen|ter's
Son; one who&s;e Family and O|riginal
they had a mean Opinion of,
and who&s;e Brothers and Si&s;ters were
ordinary People like them&s;elves.</P>
<P>There even yet remains a Que|&s;tion,
whether the In&s;truction of
the&s;e Things will take place, when
you are &s;uppo&s;ing the Scene, which
is placed &s;o far off, had its Original
&s;o near Home.</P>
<P><PB REF="13">
But I am far from being anxious
about that, &s;eeing I am well a&s;&s;ur'd,
that if the Ob&s;tinacy of our Age
&s;hould &s;hut their Ears again&s;t the ju&s;t
Reflections made in this Volume,
upon the Tran&s;actions taken Notice
of in the former, there will come an
Age, when the Minds of Men &s;hall
be more flexible, when the Prejudi|ces
of their Fathers &s;hall have no
Place, and when the Rules of Ver|tue
and Religion ju&s;tly recommend|ed,
&s;hall be more gratefully accep|ted
than they may be now, that
our Children may ri&s;e up in Judg|ment
again&s;t their fathers, and one
Generation be edified by the &s;ame
Teaching, which another Generation
had de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>THE

<P>_THE publi&s;hing this extraordinary
Volume will appear to be no Pre|&s;umption,
when it &s;hall be remembred,
with what unexpected Good <HI>and
Evil</HI> Will, the former Volumes have been ac|cepted
in the World.</P>
<P>If the Foundation has been &s;o well laid, the
Structure cannot but be expected to bear a Pro|portion;
and while the Parable has been &s;o di|verting,
the Moral mu&s;t certainly be equally
agreeable.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s the two former Parts have met
with, has been known by the Envy it has
brought upon the Editor, expre&s;s'd in a thou&s;and
hard Words from the Men of Trade; the Effect
of that Regret which they entertain'd, at their
having no Share in it: And I mu&s;t do the Au|thor
the Ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that not a Dog has
wag'd his Tongue at the Work it&s;elf, nor has a
Word been &s;aid to le&s;&s;en the Value of it, but
which has been the vi&s;ible Effect of that Envy
at the good Fortune of the Book&s;eller.</P>
<P><PB REF="15">
The Riddle is now expounded, and the inte+ligent
Reader may &s;ee clearly the End and De|&s;ign
of the whole Works; that it is calculated for,
and dedicated to the Improvement and In&s;tru|ction
of Mankind in the Ways of Vertue and
Piety, by repre&s;enting the various Circum&s;tances,
to which Mankind is expo&s;ed; and encouraging
&s;uch as fall into ordinary or extraordinary Ca|&s;ualties
of Life, how to work thro' Difficulties,
with unwearied Diligence and Application,
and look up to Providence for Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>The Ob&s;ervations and Reflections, that take
up this volume, crown the Work; if the Do|ctrine
has been accepted, the Application mu&s;t of
Nece&s;&s;ity plea&s;e; and the Author &s;hews now,
that he has learn'd &s;ufficient Experience, how
to make other Men wi&s;e and him&s;elf happy.</P>
<P>The Moral of the Fable, <HI>as the Author calls
it,</HI> is mo&s;t in&s;tructing; and tho&s;e who challeng'd
him mo&s;t maliciou&s;ly, with not making his Pen
u&s;eful, will have Lei&s;ure to reflect, that they
pa&s;s'd their Cen&s;ure too &s;oon; and like <HI>Solo|mon</HI>'s

<P>Tho&s;e who&s;e Avarice prevailing over their

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Mu&s;t have made very little U&s;e of my &s;olitary and wan|dring
Years, if after &s;uch a Scene of Wonders, as
my Life may be ju&s;tly call'd, I had nothing to &s;ay,

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of SOLIT&V;DE.</HEAD>
<Q>How uncapable to make us happy, and
How unqualify'd to a Chri&s;tian Life.</Q>
<P>_I Have frequently look'd back, you may
be &s;ure, and that with different
Thoughts, upon the Notions of a
long tedious Life of Solitude, which
I have repre&s;ented to the World,
and of which you mu&s;t have formed &s;ome Ideas
from the Life of a Man in an I&s;land. Sometimes
<PB N="2" REF="18">
I have wonder'd how it could be &s;upported, e&s;pe|cially
for the fir&s;t Years, when the Change was
violent and impos'd, and Nature unacquainted with
any thing like it. Sometimes I have as much
wonder'd, why it &s;hould be any Grievance or Af|fliction;
&s;eeing upon the whole View of the Stage
of Life which we act upon in this World, it
&s;eems to me, that Life in general is, or ought to be,
but one universal Act of Solitude: But I find it is
natural to judge of Happine&s;s, by its &s;uiting or
not &s;uiting our own Inclinations. Every Thing
revolves in our Minds by innumerable circular
Motions, all centring in our &s;elves. We judge
of Pro&s;perity, and of Affliction, Joy and Sorrow,
poverty, Riches, and all the various Scenes of
Life: I &s;ay, we judge of them by our &s;elves: Thi|ther
we bring them Home, as Meats touch the
Palat, by which we try them; the gay Part of
the World, or the heavy Part; it is all one, they
only call it plea&s;ant or unplea&s;ant, as they &s;uit
our Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The World, I &s;ay, is nothing to us, but as it
is more or le&s;s to our Reli&s;h: All Reflection is
carry'd Home, and our Dear-&s;elf is, in one Re&s;pect,
the End of Living. Hence Man may be proper|ly
&s;aid to be <HI>alone</HI> in the Mid&s;t of the Crowds
and Hurry of Men and Bu&s;ine&s;s: All the Refle|ctions
which he makes, are to him&s;elf; all that
is plea&s;ant, he embraces for him&s;elf; all that is
irk&s;ome and grievous, is ta&s;ted but by his own
Palat.</P>
<P>What are the Sorrows of other Men to us? And
what their joy? Something we may be touch'd
indeed with, by the Power of Sympathy, and a
&s;ecret Turn of the Affections; but all the &s;olid
Reflection is directed to our &s;elves. Our Medi|tations
are all Solitude in Perfection; our Pa&s;&s;ions
<PB N="3" REF="19">
are all exerci&s;ed in Retirement; we love, we hate,
we covet, we enjoy, all in Privacy and Solitude:
All that we communicate of tho&s;e Things to any
other, is but for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Pur&s;uit of
our De&s;ires; the End is at Home; the Enjoy|ment,
the Contemplation, is all Solitude and Re|tirement,
`tis for our &s;elves we enjoy, and for
our &s;elves we &s;uffer.</P>
<P>What then is the Silence of Life? And, How
is it afflicting, while a Man has the Voice of his
Soul to &s;peak to God, and to him&s;elf? That Man
can never want Conver&s;ation, who is Company
for him&s;elf; and he that cannot conver&s;e profita|bly
with him&s;elf, is not fit for any Conver&s;ation
at all; and yet there are many good Rea&s;ons why
a Life of Solitude; as Solitude is now under&s;tood
by the Age, is not at all &s;uited to the Life of a
Chri&s;tian, or of a wi&s;e Man. Without enquiring
therefore into the Advantages of Solitude, and
how it is to be managed, I de&s;ire to be heard
concerning what Solitude really is; for I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s,
I have different Notions about it, far from
tho&s;e which are generally under&s;tood in the World,
and far from all tho&s;e Notions upon which tho&s;e
People in the primitive Times, and &s;ince that al&s;o,
acted, who &s;eparated them&s;elves into De&s;arts
and unfrequented Places, or confin'd them&s;elves to
Cells, Monasteries, and the like, retir'd, as they
call it, from the World; All which, I think,
have nothing of the Thing I call Solitude in them,
nor do they an&s;wer any of the true Ends of Solitude,
much le&s;s tho&s;e Ends which are pretended to be
&s;ought after, by tho&s;e who have talk'd mo&s;t of
tho&s;e Retreats from the World.</P>
<P>As for Confinement in an I&s;land, if the Scene
was plac'd there for this very End, it were not at
all ami&s;s. I mu&s;t acknowledge, there was Con|finement
<PB N="4" REF="20">
from the Enjoyments of the World, and
Re&s;traint from human Society: <HI>But all that was
no Solitude;</HI> indeed no Part of it was &s;o, except
that which, as in my Story, I apply'd to the
Contemplation of &s;ublime Things, and that was
but a very little, as my Readers well know, com|par'd
to what a Length of Years my forced Retreat
la&s;ted.</P>
<P>It is evident then, that as I &s;ce nothing but
what is far from being retir'd, in the forced Re|treat
of an I&s;land, the Thoughts being in no Com|po&s;ure
&s;uitable to a retired Condition, no not for a
great While; &s;o I can affirm, that I enjoy much more
Solitude in the Middle of the greate&s;t Collection
of Mankind in the World, I mean, at <HI>London,</HI>
while I am writing this, than ever I could &s;ay I
enjoy'd in eight and twenty Years Confinnement
to a de&s;olate I&s;land.</P>
<P>I have heard of a Man, that upon &s;ome extraor|dinary
Di&s;gu&s;t which he took at the un&s;uitable
Conver&s;ation of &s;ome of his neare&s;t Relations,
who&s;e Society he could not avoid, &s;uddenly re&s;olved
never to &s;peak any more: He kept his Re&s;olution
mo&s;t rigorou&s;ly many Years; not all the Tears or
Entreaties of his Friends, no not of his Wife and
Children, could prevail with him to break his Si|lence.
It &s;eems it was their ill Behaviour to him
at fir&s;t, that was the Occa&s;ion of it; for they
treated him with provoking Language, which
frequently put him into undecent Pa&s;&s;ions, and ur|ged
him to ra&s;h Replies; and he took this &s;evere
Way to puni&s;h him&s;elf for being provok'd, and to pu|ni&s;h
them for provoking him: But the Severity was
unju&s;tifiable; it ruin'd his Family, and broke up
his Hou&s;e: His Wife could not bear it, and after
endeavouring, by all the Ways po&s;&s;ible, to alter his
rigid Silence, went fir&s;t away from him, and af|terwards

could have much Force in them.</P>
<P>Had he been a &s;ingle Man, had he wandred into a

Silence might ha$ been as commendable, and as
I think, much more than any of the primitive
Chri&s;tians Vows of Solitude were; who&s;e Re|treat
into the Wilderne&s;s, and giving them&s;elves up
to Prayer and Contemplation, &s;hunning human So|ciety,

they took it from an old Proverb they had in the
World at that time: <HI>That every &s;olitary Per&s;on mu&s;t

<P>A Man under a Vow of perpetual Silence, if
but rigorou&s;ly ob&s;erv'd, would be even on the Ex|change
of <HI>London,</HI> as perfectly retired from the
World, as a Hermit in his Cell; or a <HI>Solitair</HI> in
the De&s;arts of <HI>Arabia;</HI> and if he is able to ob|&s;erve
it rigorou&s;ly, may reap all the Advantages
or tho&s;e Solitudes, without the unju&s;tifiable Part
of &s;uch a Life, and without the Au&s;terities of a
Life among Brutes. For the Soul of a Man un|der
a due and regular Conduct, is as capable of
re&s;erving it &s;elf, or &s;eparating it &s;elf from the re&s;t
of human Society, in the mid&s;t of a Throng, as
it is when bani&s;h'd into a de&s;olate I&s;land.</P>
<P>The Truth is, that all tho&s;e religious Hermit|like
Solitudes, which Men value them&s;elves &s;o
much upon, are but an Acknowledgment of the
Defect or Imperfection of our Re&s;olutions, our
Incapacity to bind our &s;elves to needful Re&s;traints,
or rigorou&s;ly to ob&s;erve the Limitations we have
vow'd our &s;elves to ob&s;erve; <HI>Or take it thus,</HI> That
the Man fir&s;t re&s;olving that it would be his Feli|city

with Heaven, and heavenly Things, to be &s;epa|rated
to Prayer and good Works; but being &s;en|&s;ible
how ill &s;uch a Life will agree with Fle&s;h and
Blood, cau&s;es his Soul to commit a Rape upon his
Body, and to carry it by Force, as it were into
a De&s;art, or into a religious Retirement, from
whence it cannot return, and where it is impo&s;&s;ible
for it to have any Conver&s;e with Mankind, other

I &s;hall bring it home to the Ca&s;e in Hand thus:
Chri&s;tians may without doubt come to enjoy all
the de&s;irable Advantages of Solitude, by a &s;trict
Retirement, and exact Government of their
Thoughts, without any of the&s;e Formalities, Ri|gours,
and apparent Mortifications, which I think
I ju&s;tly call a Rape upon human Nature, and con&s;e|quently
without the Breach of Chri&s;tian Duties,
which they nece&s;&s;arily carry with them, &s;uch as
rejecting Chri&s;tian Communion, Sacraments, Or|dinances,
and the like.</P>
<P>There is no need of a Wilderne&s;s to wander
among wild Bea&s;ts, no nece&s;&s;ity of a Cell on the
top of a Mountain, or a de&s;olate I&s;land in the
Sea; if the Mind be confin'd, if the Soul be truly
Ma&s;ter of it &s;elf, all is &s;afe; for it is certainly and
effectually Ma&s;ter of the Body, and what &s;ignify
Retreats, e&s;pecially a forc'd Retreat as mine was?
The anxiety of my Circum&s;tances there, I can a&s;&s;ure
you, was &s;uch for a Time, as were very &s;uitable
to heavenly Meditations, and even when that was
got over, the frequent Alarms from the Savages,
put the Soul &s;ometimes to &s;uch Extremities of
Fear and Horrour, that all manner of Temper was
lo&s;t, and I was no more fit for religious Exerci&s;es,
than a &s;ick Man is fit for Labour,</P>
<P>Divine Contemplations require a Compo&s;ure
of Soul, uninterrupted by any extraordinary Mo|tions
or Di&s;orders of the Pa&s;&s;ions; and this, I
&s;ay, is much ea&s;ier to be obtained and enjoy'd in
the ordinary Cour&s;e of Life, than in Monki&s;h Cells
and forcible Retreats.</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s is to get a retired Soul, a Frame of
Mind truly elevated above the World, and then
we may be alone whenever we plea&s;e, in the
greate&s;t apparent Hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s or Com|pany:
If the Thoughts are free, and rightly un|engag'd,
<PB N="8" REF="24">
What Imports the Employment the Body
is engag'd in? Does not the Soul act by a dif|fering
Agency, and is not the Body the Servant,
nay, the Slave of the Soul? Has the Body Hands
to act, or Feet to walk, or Tongue to &s;peak,
but by the Agency of the Under&s;tanding, and
Will, which are the two Deputies of the Soul's
Power? Are not all the Affections, and all the
Pa&s;&s;ions which &s;o univer&s;ally agitate, direct, and
po&s;&s;e&s;s the Body, are they not all &s;eated in the
Soul? What have we to do then more or le&s;s, but
to get the Soul into a &s;uperior Direction and Ele|vation,
there's no Need to pre&s;cribe the Bo|dy
to this or that Situation; the Hands, or Feet,
or Tongue, can no more di&s;turb the Retirement of
the Soul, than a Man having Money in his Pocket
can take it out, or pay it, or di&s;po&s;e of it by his
Hand, without his own Knowledge.</P>
<P>It is the Soul's being entangled by outward Ob|jects,
that interrupts its Contemplation of divine
Objects, which is the Excu&s;e for the&s;e Solitudes,
and makes the removing the Body from tho&s;e out|ward
Objects &s;eemingly nece&s;&s;ary; but what is
there of Religion in all this? For Example, a vi|cious
Inclination remov'd from the Object, is &s;till
a vicious Inclination, and contracts the &s;ame Guilt,
as if the Object were at Hand; for if, as our
Saviour &s;ays, <HI>He that looketh on a Woman to lu&s;t
after her,</HI> that is, to de&s;ire her unlawfully, has
committed the Adultery already; &s;o it will&punc; be no
inverting our Saviour's Meaning to &s;ay, that he
that thinketh of a Woman to de&s;ire her unlawfully,
has committed Adultery with her already, though
he has not looked on her, or has not &s;een her at
that Time; and how &s;hall this thinking of her be
remov'd by tran&s;porting the Body? It mu&s;t be
remov'd by the Change in the Soul, by bringing
<PB N="9" REF="25">
the Mind to be above the Power or Reach of the
Allurement, and to an ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter&s;hip over
the wicked De&s;ire; otherwi&s;e the vicious De&s;ire
remains as the Force remains in the Gunpowder,
and will exert it &s;elf when ever toucht with the
Fire.</P>
<P>All Motions to Good or Evil are in the Soul$
Outward Objects are but &s;econd Cau&s;es; and tho'
it is true, &s;eparating the Man from the Object, is
the Way to make any Act impo&s;&s;ible to be com|mitted;
yet where the Guilt does not lye in the
Act only, but in the Intention or De&s;ire to com|mit
it, that Separation is nothing at all, and ef|fects
nothing at all. There may be as much Adul|tery
committed in a Mona&s;tery, where a Woman
never comes, as in any other Place, and perhaps
is &s;o: The ab&s;taining from Evil therefore depends
not only and wholly upon limiting, or confining
the Man's Actions, but upon the Man's limiting
and confining his De&s;ires; &s;eeing to de&s;ire to &s;in,
<HI>is to Sin;</HI> and the Fact which we would commit
if we had Opportunity, is really committed, and
mu&s;t be an&s;wer'd for as &s;uch. What then is
there of Religion, I &s;ay, in forc'd Retirements
from the World, and Vows of Silence or Soli|tude?
They are all nothing; `tis a retired Soul
that alone is fit for Contemplation; and it is the
Conque&s;t of our De&s;ires to Sin, that is the only
human Pre&s;ervative again&s;t Sin.</P>
<P>It was a great while after I came into human
Society, that I felt &s;ome Regret at the Lo&s;s of the
&s;olitary Hours and Retirements I had in the I|&s;land;
but when I came to reflect upon &s;ome ill
&s;pent Time, even in my Solitudes, I found Rea|&s;on
to &s;ee what I have &s;aid above; that a Man
may &s;in alone &s;everal Ways, and find &s;ubject of
<PB N="10" REF="26">
Repentance for his &s;olitary Crimes, as well as he
may in the mid&s;t of a populous City.</P>
<P>The Excellency of any State of Life con&s;i&s;ts
in its Freedom from Crime; and it is evident to
our Experience, that &s;ome Society may be better
adapted to a Rectitude of Life, than a compleat
Solitude and Retirement: Some have &s;aid, that
<HI>next to no Company, good Company is be&s;t;</HI> but it is my
Opinion, that <HI>next to good Company, no Company is
be&s;t;</HI> for as it is certain, that <HI>no Company</HI> is better
than <HI>bad Company,</HI> &s;o 'tis as certain, that <HI>good Com|pany</HI>
is much better than <HI>no Company.</HI></P>
<P>In Solitude a Man conver&s;es with him&s;elf, and
as a wi&s;e Man &s;aid, he is not always &s;ure that he
does not conver&s;e with his Enemy; but he that
is in good Company, is &s;ure to be always among
his Friends.</P>
<P>The Company of religious good Men, is a
con&s;tant Re&s;traint from Evil, and an Encouragement
to a religious Life. You have there the Beauty of
Religion exemplified; you never want as well In|&s;truction
in, as Example for, all that is good; you
have a Contempt of evil Things con&s;tantly re|commended,
and the Affections mov'd to delight
in what is good by hou$ly Imitation: If we are
alone, we want all the&s;e, and are led right, or led
wrong, as the Temper of the Mind, which is
&s;ometimes too much the Guide of our Actions, as
well as Thoughts, happens to be con&s;tituted at that
Time. Here we have no Re&s;traint upon our
Thoughts, but from our &s;elves, no Re&s;traint upon
our Actions, but from our own Con&s;ciences, and
nothing to a&s;&s;ist us in our Mortifications of our
De&s;ires, or in directing our De&s;ires, but our own
Reflections, which after all may often err, often
be prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="27">
If you wou'd retreat from the World then, be
&s;ure to retreat to good Company; retreat to good
Books, and retreat to good Thoughts; the&s;e will
always a&s;&s;i&s;t one another, and always join to a&s;&s;i&s;t
him that flies to them in his Meditations, di|rect
him to ju&s;t Reflections, and mutually encou|rage
him again&s;t whatever may attack him, from
within him, or without him: Whereas to retreat
from the World, as it is call'd, is to retreat from
good Men, who are our be&s;t Friends: Be&s;ides,
to retreat, as we call it to an entire perfect Soli|tude,
is to retreat from the publick Wor&s;hip of
God, to for&s;ake the A&s;&s;emblies; and, in a Word,
is unlawful, becau&s;e it obliges us to abandon
tho&s;e Things, which we are commanded to do.</P>
<P>Solitude therefore, as I under&s;tand by it, a
Retreat from human Society, on a religious or
philo&s;ophical Account, Is a meer Cheat; it nei|ther
can an&s;wer the End it propo&s;es, or qualify
us for the Duties of Religion, which we are com|manded
to perform; and is therefore both irreli|gious
in it &s;elf, and incon&s;i&s;tent with a Chri&s;tian
Life many Ways. Let the Man that would reap
the Advantage of Solitude, and that under&s;tands
the Meaning of the Word, learn to retire into
him&s;elf: Serious Meditation is the E&s;&s;ence of So|litude;
all the Retreats into Woods and De&s;arts
are &s;hort of this; and though a Man that is per|fectly
Ma&s;ter of this Retirement, may be a little
in Danger of Quieti&s;m, that is to &s;ay, of an Af|fectation
of Re&s;ervedne&s;s; yet it may be a Slander
upon him in the main, and he may make him&s;elf
amends upon the World, by the ble&s;&s;ed Calm of
his Soul, which they perhaps who appear more
chearful may have little of</P>
<P>Retiring into De&s;arts, in the fir&s;t Days of Reli|gion,
and into Abbeys and Mcna&s;teries &s;ince,

what have they been? Or what have they been
able to do, towards purcha&s;ing the Retirement I
&s;peak of? They have indeed been Things to be
reckon'd among Au&s;terities, and Acts of Mortifi|cation,
and &s;o far might be commendable: But I
mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon it, that a retired Soul is not affe|cted
with them, any more than with the Hurries
of Company and Society. When the Soul of a
Man is powerfully engag'd in any particular Sub|ject,
'tis like that of St. <HI>Paul, wrapt up,</HI> whether
it be into the third Heaven, or to any Degree
of lower Exaltation: Such a Man may well &s;ay
with the Apo&s;tle above, <HI>Whether I was in the Body,
or out of the Body, I cannot tell.</HI> It was in &s;uch a
wrapt up State, that I conceived in what I call my
<HI>Vi&s;ion of the Angelical World;</HI> of which I have
here &s;ubjoined a very little Part.</P>
<P>Is it rational to believe, that a Mind exalted &s;o
far above the State of Things with which we ordi|narily
conver&s;e, &s;hould not be capable of a Sepa|ration
from them, which, in a Word, is the ut|mo&s;t
Extent of Solitude? Let &s;uch never afflict
them&s;elves, that they cannot retreat from the
World: Let them learn to retreat in the World,
and they &s;hall enjoy a perfect Solitude; as com|pleat
to all Intents and Purpo&s;es, as it they were
to live in the Cupola of St. <HI>Paul's,</HI> or, as if they
were to live upon the Top of <HI>Cheviot</HI> Hill in
<HI>Northumberland.</HI></P>
<P>They that cannot be retir'd in this Manner,
mu&s;t not only retire from the World, but out of
the World, before they can arrive to any true
Solitude. Man is a Creature &s;o form'd for Socie|ty,
that it may not only be &s;aid, that it is not
good for him to be alone, but 'tis really impo&s;|&s;ible
he &s;hould be alone: We are &s;o continually in
need of one another; nay, in &s;uch ab&s;olute Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
<PB N="13" REF="29">
of A&s;&s;i&s;tance from one another, that tho&s;e
who have pretended to give us the Lives and
Manner of the <HI>Solitaires,</HI> as they call them, who
&s;eparated them&s;elves, from Mankind, and wander'd
in the De&s;arts of <HI>Arabia</HI> and <HI>Lybia,</HI> are frequently
put to the Trouble of bringing the Angels down
from Heaven to do one Drudgery or another for
them; forming imaginary Miracles, to make the
Life of a true Solitair po&s;&s;ible; &s;ometimes they
have no Bread, &s;ometimes no Water, for a long
Time together; and then a Miracle is brought
upon the Stage, to make them live &s;o long with|out
Food; at other Times they have Angels come
to be their Cooks, and bring them Roa&s;t-meat; to
be their Phy&s;icians, to bring them Phy&s;ick, and
the like: If Saint <HI>Hillary</HI> comes in his Wan|drings
to the River <HI>Nile,</HI> an humble Crocrodile
is brought to carry him over upon his Back; tho'
they do not tell us, whether the Crocodile ask'd
him, to ride, or he ask'd the Crocodile, or by what
Means they came to be &s;o familiar with one ano|ther:
And, what, is all this to the Retirement of
the Soul, with which it conver&s;es in Heaven in
the mid&s;t of infinite Crowds of Men, and to whom
the neare&s;t of other Objects is nothing at all, any
more than the Objects of Mountains and De&s;arts,
Lions and Leopards, and the like, were to tho&s;e

are ea&s;y, and Provi&s;ion for the Nece&s;&s;aries of

Want of, is quietly and plentifully made; has not

when, where; and as often as he plea&s;es; let his

<P>I knew a poor, but good Man; who tho' he was
a Labourer, was a Man of Sen&s;e and Religion;
who being hard at Work with &s;ome other Men,
removing a great Quantity of Earth to rai&s;e a
Bank again&s;t the Side of a Pond, was one Day &s;o
out of him&s;elf, and wrapt up in a perfect Appli|cation
of his Mind, to a very &s;erious Subject,
that the poor Man drove him&s;elf and his Wheel-barrow
into the Pond, and could not recover him|&s;elf,
till Help came to him. This Man was cer|tainly
capable of a perfect Solitude, and perhaps
really enjoy'd it; for as I have often heard him
&s;ay, he liv'd alone in the World: (1.) Had no
Family to embarra&s;s his Affections. (2.) His low
Circum&s;tances placed him below the Ob&s;ervation
of the upper Degrees of Mankind. (3.) And his
re&s;erv'd Meditations plac'd him above the wicked
Part, who were tho&s;e in a Sphere equal to him|&s;elf;
among whom, as he &s;aid, <HI>and is mo&s;t true,</HI>
it was very hard to find a &s;ober Man, much le&s;s a
good Man; &s;o that he liv'd really alone in the
World; apply'd him&s;elf to labour for his Sub&s;i&s;tance,
had no other Bu&s;ine&s;s with Mankind, but for Ne|ce&s;&s;aries
of Life, and convers'd in Heaven, as ef|fectually,

If this Retirement, which they call <HI>Solitude,</HI> con|&s;i&s;ted
only of &s;eparating the Per&s;on from the World,
that is to &s;ay, from human Society, it were it&s;elf
a very mean Thing, and would every Way as well
be &s;upplied, by removing from a Place where a
Man is known, to a Place where he is not known,
and there accu&s;tom him&s;elf to a retir'd Life, ma|king
no new Acquaintance, and only making the
U&s;e of Mankind which I have already, &s;poken of;
namely for Convenience, and Supply of nece&s;&s;ary
Food; and I think of the Two, that &s;uch a Man,
or a Man &s;o rerir'd, may have more Opportunity
to be an entire Reclu&s;e, and may enjoy more real
Solitude, than a Man in a De&s;art. For Example,</P>
<P>In the Solitude I &s;peak of, a Man has no more
to do for the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, than to receive
them from the Hands of tho&s;e that are to furni&s;h
them, and pay them for &s;o doing; whereas, in
the Solitude of De&s;arts, and wandring Lives, from
whence all our Monki&s;h Devotion &s;prings, they
had every Day their Food, &s;uch as it was, to
&s;eek, or the Load of it to carry; and except where
as it is &s;aid, they put Providence to the Opera|tion
of a Miracle, to furni&s;h it, they had frequently
Difficulties enough to &s;u&s;tain Life; and if we
may believe Hi&s;tory, many of them were &s;tarv'd
to Death for meer Hunger, or Thir&s;t; and as
often the latter as the former.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that had Recour&s;e to the&s;e Solitudes,
merely as a Mortification of their Bodies, as I
ob&s;erv'd before, and delivering them&s;elves from the
Temptations! which Society expo&s;ed them to,
had more Room for the Pretence indeed, than
tho&s;e who alledge they did it to give up them|&s;elves
to Prayer and Meditation. The fir&s;t might:

it will that is meant there, it is not to my Pur|po&s;e;
but he pray'd to the Lord thrice; that was
the fir&s;t Method the Apo&s;tle took, and thereby &s;et
a pious Example to all tho&s;e who are a&s;&s;aulted by
any Temptation. He did not immediately fly
to Au&s;terities and bodily Mortifications, &s;epara|ting
him&s;elf from Mankind, or flying into the
De&s;art to give him&s;elf up to Fa&s;ting, and a Re|treat
from the World, which is the Object of all
private Snare. But he applied him&s;elf by &s;erious
Prayer to him, who had taught us to pray, <HI>Lead
us not into Temptation;</HI> and the An&s;wer likewi&s;e is
in&s;tructing in the Ca&s;e; he was not driven out as

<HEAD TYPE="sub">An E&s;&s;ay upon HONESTY.</HEAD>
<P>_WHEN I fir&s;t came home to my own
Country, and began to &s;it down and
look back upon the pa&s;t Circum&s;tan|ces
of my wandring State, as you
will in Charity &s;uppo&s;e I could not
but do very often; the very Pro&s;perity I enjoy'd
led me mo&s;t naturally to reflect upon the particu|lar
Steps by which I arriv'd to it. The Condi|tion
I was in was very happy, &s;peaking of hu|man
Felicity; the former Captivity I had &s;uffer'd,
made my Liberty &s;weeter to me; and to find my
&s;elf jump'd into ea&s;y Circum&s;tances at once, from
a Condition below the common Rate of Life,
made it &s;till &s;weeter.</P>
<P>One Time, as I was upon my Enquiries into
the happy Concurrence of the Cau&s;es which
had brought the Event of my Pro&s;perity to
pa&s;s, as an Effect, it occurr'd to my Thoughts,
how much of it all depended, under the
Di&s;po&s;ition of Providence, upon the Principle
of <HI>Honesty,</HI> which I met with, in almo&s;t all the
People whom it was my Lot to be concern'd with
in my private and particular Affairs; and I that
had met with &s;uch extraordinary In&s;tances of the
Knavery and Villainy of Mens Natures in other
Circum&s;tances, could not but be &s;omthing taken
<PB N="19" REF="35">
up with Miracles of Hone&s;ty that I had met
with among the &s;everal People I had had to do
with, I mean tho&s;e whom I had more particularly
to do with in the Articles of my Liberty, E&s;tate,
or Effects, which fell into their Hands.</P>
<P>I began with my mo&s;t tru&s;ty and faithful Wi|dow,
the Captain's Wife, with whom I fir&s;t went
to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> and to whom I entru&s;ted
200 <HI>l.</HI> being the Gain I had made in my fir&s;t Ad|ventures
to <HI>Guinea,</HI> as in the fir&s;t Volume, Page
330, appears.</P>
<P>She was left a Widow, and in but indifferent
Circum&s;tances; but when I &s;ent to her &s;o far off as
the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> where I was in &s;uch a Condition as &s;he
might have rea&s;onably believed I &s;hould never
have been able to come my &s;elf; and if I had,
might be in no Condition to recover it of her;
and having my &s;elf nothing to &s;hew under her
Hand for the Tru&s;t; yet &s;he was &s;o ju&s;t, that &s;he
&s;ent the full Value of what I wrote for, being
one hundred Pound; and to &s;hew, as far as in her
lay, her &s;incere hone&s;t Concern for my Good, put
in among many nece&s;&s;ary Things which I did not
write for, I &s;ay, put in two Bibles, be&s;ides other
good Books, for my Reading and In&s;truction, as
&s;he &s;aid afterwards, in Popi&s;h and Heathen Coun|tries,
where I might chance to fall. Hone&s;ty not
only leads to di&s;charge every Debt and every Tru&s;t
to our Neighbour, &s;o far as is ju&s;tly to be deman|ded,
but an hone&s;t Man acknowledges him&s;elf
Debtor to all Mankind, for &s;o much Good to be
done for them, whether for Soul or Body, as Pro|vidence
puts an Opportunity into his Hands to do:
In Order to di&s;charge this Debt, he &s;tudies
continually for Opportunity to do all the Acts of
Kindne&s;s and Beneficence, that is po&s;&s;ible for him
to do; and tho' very few con&s;ider it, a Man is
<PB N="20" REF="36">
not a compleatly hone&s;t Man, that does not do
this.</P>
<P>Upon this Con&s;ideration, I que&s;tion much,
whether a covetous, narrow, &s;tingy Man, as we
call him, one who gives him&s;elf up to him&s;elf,
us born for him&s;elf only, and who declines the
Advantages and Opportunities of doing Good,
I mean, extreamly &s;o: I &s;ay, I much que&s;tion,
whether &s;uch a Man can be <HI>an hone&s;t Man;</HI> nay, I
am &s;atisfy'd he cannot be hone&s;t Man; for tho'
he may pay every Man his own, and be ju&s;t, as he
thinks it, to a Farthing; yet this is Part of the
Ju&s;tice, which in the common Phra&s;e is the grea|te&s;t
Unju&s;tice. This is one Meaning of that Say|ing,
<HI>Summum jus, &s;umma injuria.</HI></P>
<P>To pay every Man their own, is <HI>the common
Law</HI> of Hone&s;ty; but to do Good to all Mankind,
as far as you are able, is the <HI>Chancery</HI> Law of Ho|ne&s;ty;
and tho' in common Law or Ju&s;tice, as I
call it, Mankind can have no Claim upon us, if
we do but ju&s;t pay our Debt; yet in Heaven's
<HI>Chancery</HI> they will have Relief again&s;t us; for
they have a Demand in Equity, of all the Good to
be done them, that it is in our Power to do, and
this <HI>Chancery</HI> Court, or Court of Equity, is held
in every Man's Brea&s;t; 'tis a true <HI>Court of Con|&s;cience,</HI>
and every Man's Con&s;cience is a Lord
Chancellour to him; if he has not perform'd,
if he has not paid this Debt, Con&s;cience will de|cree
him to pay it, on the Penalty of declaring
him <HI>a di&s;hone&s;t Man,</HI> even in his own Opinion;
and if he &s;till refu&s;es to comply, will proceed
by all the legal Steps of a Court of Con&s;cience
Proce&s;s, till at la&s;t it will i&s;&s;ue out a Writ of Re|bellion
again&s;t him, and proclaim him a Rebel to
Nature and his own Con&s;cience.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="37">
But this is by the Way, and is occa&s;ioned by
the Ob&s;ervations I have made of many People,
who think they are mighty hone&s;t if they pay
their Debts, and owe no Man any Thing, <HI>as they
call it;</HI> at the &s;ame Time, like true Mi&s;ers, who
lay up all for them&s;elves, they think nothing of the
Debt of Charity and Beneficence, which they
owe to all Mankind.</P>
<P>Rich Men are their Maker's Free-holders;
they enjoy freely the E&s;tate he has given them the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, with all the Rents, Profits, and
Emoluments, but charg'd with a <HI>free Farm</HI> Rent
to the younger Children of the Family, namely
to the Poor; or if you will, you may call them.
God's Copy-holders, paying a Quit-Rent to the
Lord of the Manor; which Quit-Rent he has
a&s;&s;igned for the U&s;e of the re&s;t of Mankind, to
be paid in a con&s;tant Di&s;charge of all good Offi|ces,
friendly, kind, and generous Actions; and
he that will not pay his Rent, cannot be an ho|ne&s;t
Man, any more than he that would not pay
his other ju&s;t Debts.</P>
<P>The Scripture concurs exactly with this No|tion
of mine; the Mi&s;er is call'd by the Prophet
<HI>I&s;aiah, a vile Per&s;on, one that works Iniquity, and
practi&s;es Hypocri&s;y, and utters Error before the Lord,</HI>
I&s;aiah xxxii. 6. How does this appear? The ve|ry
next Words explain it. <HI>He makes empty the Soul
of the Hungry, and he will cau&s;e the Drink of the
Thir&s;ty to fail.</HI> But le&s;t this &s;hould &s;eem a &s;train'd
Text, let us read on, both before and after, <HI>Ver&s;e</HI>
5. <HI>The</HI> Vile <HI>Per&s;on &s;hall no more be call'd</HI> Liberal,
<HI>nor the</HI> Churl <HI>&s;aid to be</HI> Bountiful. Here the Op|po&s;ite
to a Liberal Man is call'd a Vile Per&s;on,
and the Oppo&s;ite to a Bountiful Man is call'd a
Churl; and in the Ver&s;e following, the &s;ame
Vile Per&s;on, as oppo&s;ed to the Liberal Man, is
<PB N="22" REF="38">
call'd a Wicked Man; and the Liberal Man is
&s;et up a Pattern for us all, in Oppo&s;ition to the
vile, churli&s;h, covetous Wretch. Ver&s;. 7, 8. <HI>The
In&s;truments al&s;o of the Churl are evil: He devi&s;eth
wicked Devices to de&s;troy the Poor with lying Words,
even when the N$edy &s;peaketh right. But the Liberal
devi&s;eth liberal Things, and by liberal Things &s;hall he
&s;tand.</HI></P>
<P>In a Word, I think my Opinion ju&s;tify'd by this
Text, that a Churl, a moro&s;e, &s;owre Di&s;po&s;ition,
a covetous, avaricious, &s;elfi&s;h principl'd Man, can|not
be an <HI>hone&s;t Man;</HI> he does not pay the common
Debt of Mankind to one another, nor the Fee-Farm,
or Quit-Rent of his E&s;tate to God, who is his
Great Landlord, or Lord of the Manor, and who has
charg'd the Debt upon him. I know the Mi&s;er
will laugh at this Notion; but I &s;peak my own
Opinion, let it go as far as Rea&s;on will car|ry
it.</P>
<P>I come back to the Examples I was giving in
my private Ca&s;e. As the Widow was hone&s;t to
me, &s;o was my good <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Captain; and it
is this Man's original Hone&s;ty, that makes me
&s;peak of the hone&s;t Man's Debt to Mankind. It
was Hone&s;ty, a generous Hone&s;ty, that led the
poor Man to take me up at Sea; which if he had
neglected, my Boy <HI>Xury</HI> and I had peri&s;hed toge|ther:
It was no Debt to me in particular, but
a Debt to Mankind, that he paid in that Action;
and yet he could not have been an <HI>hone&s;t Man</HI> with|out
it. You will &s;ay, if he had gone away and
left me, he had been barbarous and inhuman, and
de&s;erv'd to be left to peri&s;h him&s;elf in the like
Di&s;tre&s;s: But, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> this is not all the Ca&s;e: Cu|&s;tom
and the Nature of the Thing leads us to &s;ay,
it would have been hard-hearted and inhuman;
But Con&s;cience will tell any Man, that it was a
<PB N="23" REF="39">
Debt, and he could not but be condemn'd by the
Court of Con&s;cience in his own Brea&s;t, if he had
omitted it; nay, in the Sight of Heaven he had
tacitly kill'd us, and had been as guilty of our
Death as a Murtherer; for he hat refu&s;es to &s;ave
a Life thrown into his Hands, <HI>takes it away;</HI> and
if there is a ju&s;t Retribution in a future State, if
Blood is at all requir'd there, the Blood of every
Man, Woman, or Child, whom we could have &s;a|ved,
and did not, &s;hall be reckon'd to us at that
Day, as &s;pilt by our own Hands; for leaving Life
in a Po&s;ture in which it mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h,
is without Que&s;tion cau&s;ing it to peri&s;h, and will
be call'd &s;o then, by whatever gilded dre&s;s'd-up
Words we may expre&s;s and conceal it now.</P>
<P>But I go farther, for my good <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> went
farther with me; he not only paid the Debt he
ow'd to Heaven, in &s;aving our Lives, but he
went farther: He took nothing of what I had,
tho' in the common Right, of the Sea, it was all
his Due <HI>for Salvage,</HI> as the Sailors call it: But
he gave me the Value of every Thing, bought
my Boat, which he might have turn'd adrift, my
Boy <HI>Xury,</HI> who was not my Slave by any Right,
or if he had, became free from that Time; and
the Life of <HI>Xury,</HI> which he had &s;av'd, as a Ser|vant,
was his own; yet he bought every Thing
of me, for the full Value, and took nothing of
me, no not for my Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Here was the <HI>Liberal Man devi&s;ing liberal Things,</HI>
and the Sequel made good the promi&s;&s;ory Text;
for by the&s;e liberal Things, the hone&s;t liberal
Man might be truly &s;aid to <HI>&s;tand;</HI> When I came to
reward him at my coming to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> to &s;ell my
Plantation at <HI>Bra&s;il:</HI> Then he being poor, and
reduc'd, and not able to pay even what he ow'd
<PB N="24" REF="40">
me, I gave him a Reward &s;ufficient to make his
Circum&s;tances ea&s;y all his Life after.</P>
<P>The Bounty of this Man to me, when fir&s;t he
took me up out of the Sea, was the highe&s;t and
mo&s;t compleat Act of Hone&s;ty; A generous Ho|ne&s;ty,
laying hold of an Opportunity to do Good
to an Object offer'd by the Providence, of Hea|ven,
and thereby acknowledging the Debt he had
to pay to his Maker, in the Per&s;ons of his mo&s;t
di&s;tre&s;s'd Creatures.</P>
<P>And here al&s;o let me remind may Readers of
what perhaps they &s;eldom much regard; it is not
only a Gift from Heaven to us, to be put in a
Condition of <HI>doing Good;</HI> but 'tis a Gift, and a Fa|vour
from Heaven, to, have an Opportunity of
<HI>doing the Good</HI> we are in a Condition to do; and we
ought to clo&s;e with the Opportunity, as a parti|cular
Gift from above, and be as thankful for it;
I &s;ay, as thankful for the Occa&s;ion of doing
Good, as for the Ability.</P>
<P>I might mention here the Hone&s;ty of my Fellow-Planter
in the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> and of the two Merchants
and their Sons, by who&s;e Integrity I had my
Share in the Plantation pre&s;erved, and taken Care
of; as al&s;o the Hone&s;ty of the publick Trea&s;urer
for the Church there, and the like: But I am car|ry'd
off in my Thoughts, to enlarge upon this no|ble
Principle, from the two Examples, I have al|ready
mentioned, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Guiney</HI> Captain's Wi|dow,
and the <HI>Portugue&s;e;</HI> and this in particular,
becau&s;e, &s;ince I came to <HI>England</HI> to re&s;ide, I have
met with Abundance of Di&s;putes about Hone&s;tly,
e&s;pecially in Ca&s;es where hone&s;t Men come to be
unhappy Men, when they fall into &s;uch Circum&s;tan|ces
as they cannot be hone&s;t, or rather, cannot
&s;hew the Principle of Hone&s;ty, which is really
at the Bottom of all their Actions, and which,
<PB N="25" REF="41">
but for tho&s;e Circum&s;tances which entirely di&s;a|ble
them, would certainly &s;hew it &s;elf in every
Branch of their Lives: Such Men I have too
often &s;een branded for Knaves by tho&s;e who,
if they come into the &s;ame Condition, would
perhaps do the &s;ame Things, or wor&s;e than they
may have done.</P>
<P>Both my Widow and my <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Captain,
fell into low Circum&s;tances, &s;o that they could
not make good to me my Money that was
in their Hands; and yet both of them &s;hew'd
to me, that they had not only a Principle
of Ju&s;tice, but of generous Hone&s;ty too, when
the Opportunity was put into their Hands to
do &s;o.</P>
<P>This put me upon enquiring and debating with
my &s;elf, what this &s;ubtle and imperceptible Thing,
call'd Hone&s;ty, is, and how it might be de&s;cri|bed;
&s;etting down my Thoughts, at &s;everal Times,
as Objects pre&s;ented; that Po&s;terity, if they think
them worth while, may find them both u&s;eful
and diverting. And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I thought it not
improper to lay down the Conditions upon
which I am to enter upon that De&s;cription;
that I may not be mi&s;taken, but be allow'd to ex|plain
what I mean by Hone&s;ty, before I undertake
to enter upon any Di&s;cour&s;es or Ob&s;ervations about
it.</P>
<P>And to come directly to it, <HI>for I would make as
few Preambles as po&s;&s;ible,</HI> I &s;hall crave the Liberty
in all the following Di&s;cour&s;e, to take the Term
<HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI> as I think all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Expre&s;&s;ions ought to
be taken, namely <HI>Hone&s;terly,</HI> in the common Accep|tation
of the Word, the general vulgar Sen&s;e of
it, without any Circumlocutions or Double Enten|dres
what&s;oever; for I de&s;ire to &s;peak plainly
and &s;incerely. Indeed, as I have no Talent at hard
<PB N="26" REF="42">
Words, &s;o I have no great Veneration for Etymo|logies,
e&s;pecially in <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> But &s;ince I am trea|ting
of <HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI> I de&s;ire to do it, as I &s;ay above,
hone&s;tly, according to the genuine Signification of
the Thing.</P>
<P>Neither &s;hall I examine, whether Hone&s;ty be
a natural or an acquired Virtue, whether a Ha|bit,
or a Quality, whether inherent or accidental;
all the philo&s;ophical Part of it I chu&s;e to omit.</P>
<P>Neither &s;hall I examine it, as it extends to
Spirituals, and looks towards Religion; if we en|quire
about Hone&s;ty towards God, I readily al|low
all Men are born Knaves, Villains, Thieves,
and Murtherers, and nothing but the re&s;training
Power of Providence witholds us all from &s;hew|ing
our &s;elves &s;uch, on all Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>No Man can be ju&s;t to his Maker; if he could,
all our Creeds and Confe&s;&s;ions, Litanies and Sup|plications,
were ridiculous Contradictions and
Impertinences; incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, and
with the whole Tenor of human Life.</P>
<P>In all the en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e therefore, I am to
be under&s;tood of <HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI> as it regards Mankind
among them&s;elves, as it looks from one Man to
another, in tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary Parts of Man's Life,
his Conver&s;ation and Negotiation, Tru&s;ts, Friend|&s;hips,
and all the Incidents of human Affairs.</P>
<P>The Plainne&s;s I profe&s;s, both in Style and
Method, &s;eems to me to have &s;ome &s;uitable Ana|logy
to the Subject, <HI>Hone&s;ty;</HI> and therefore, is ab|&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;trictly follow'd. And I
mu&s;t own, I am the better reconcil'd, on this very
Account, to a natural Infirmity of homely plain
Writing; in that I think the Plainne&s;s of Ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
which I am condemn'd to, will give no
Di&s;advantage to my Subject, &s;ince <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> &s;hews
the mo&s;t beautiful, and the more like <HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="43">
when Artifice is di&s;mi&s;s'd, and &s;he is hone&s;tly &s;een
by her own Light only; likewi&s;e the &s;ame Since|rity
is required in the Reader; and he that reads
this E&s;&s;ay without <HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI> will never under&s;tand
it right: <HI>She mu&s;t, I &s;ay, be view'd by her own Light.</HI>
If Prejudice, Partiality, or private Opinions &s;tand
in the Way, <HI>the Man's a reading Knave,</HI> he is not
hone&s;t to the Subject; and upon &s;uch an one all
the Labour is lo&s;t; this Work is of no U&s;e to
him, and by my Con&s;ent, the Book&s;eller &s;hould
give him his Money again.</P>
<P>If any Man, from his private ill Nature, takes
Exceptions at me, poor, wild, wicked, <HI>Robin&s;oe

you &s;ee, found me Lei&s;ure enough to re|pent

effectually; a&s;&s;i&s;ts to qualify me for the pre&s;ent Un|dertaking,
as well to recommend that Rectitude
of Soul, which I call <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> others, as to warn
tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to mi&s;take it, either in
them&s;elves or others: Heaven it &s;elf receives tho&s;e

&s;hould we al&s;o.</P>
<Q><L>They who repent, and their ill Lives amend,</L>
<L>Stand next to tho&s;e who never did offend.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="28" REF="44">
Not do I think a Man ought to be afraid or
a&s;ham'd to own and acknowledge his Follies and
Mi&s;takes, but rather to think it a Debt which <HI>Ho|ne&s;ty</HI>
obliges him to pay: Be&s;ides, our Infirmities
and Errors, to Which all Men are equally &s;ubject,
when recovered from, leave &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions be|hind
them, on tho&s;e who &s;incerely repent of them,
that they are always the forwarde&s;t to accu&s;e and
reproach them&s;elves: No Man need advi&s;e them,
or lead them; and this gives the greate&s;t Di&s;co|very
of the Hone&s;ty of the Man's Heart, and Sin|cerity
of Principles. Some People tell us, they
think they need not make any open Acknowledg|ment
of their Follies; and 'tis a Cruelty to exact
it of them; that they could rather dye than &s;ub|mit
to it; that their Spirits are too great for it;
that they are more afraid to come to &s;uch publick
Confe&s;&s;ions and Recognitions, than they would be
to meet a Cannon Bullet, or to face an Enemy:
But this is a poor mi&s;taken Piece of fal&s;e Bravery;
all Shame is Cowardi&s;e, as an eminent Poet tells
us, That all Courage is Fear, the brave&s;t Spirit
is the be&s;t qualify'd for a Penitent; 'tis a &s;trange
Thing that we &s;hould not be a&s;ham'd to offend,
but &s;hould be a&s;ham'd to repent; not afraid to
un, but afraid to confe&s;s. This very Thought
extorted the following Lines from a Friend of
mine, with whom I di&s;cour&s;ed upon this Head.</P>
<Q><L>Among the wor&s;t of Cowards let him be nam'd,</L>

<L>And to mi&s;taken Courage he's betray'd,</L>
<L>Who having &s;inn'd's a&s;ham'd to be afraid.</L></Q>
<P>But to leave the Point of Courage and Cowar|di&s;e
in our repenting of our Offences, I bring it
back to the very Point I am upon; namely that of
<PB N="29" REF="45">
<HI>Hone&s;ty.</HI> A Man cannot be truly an hone&s;t Man,
without acknowledging the Mi&s;takes he has made;
particularly, without acknowledging the Wrong
done to his Neighbour; and why pray is Ju&s;tice
le&s;s required in his Acknowledgment to his Maker?
He then that will be hone&s;t, mu&s;t dare to con|fe&s;s
he has been a Knave; for as above, &s;peaking
of our Behaviour to God, we have been all
Knaves, and all di&s;hone&s;t; and if we come to
&s;peak &s;trictly, perhaps it would hold in our Be|haviour
to one another al&s;o; for, Where's the
Man that is not chargeable by &s;ome or other of his
Neighbours, or by him&s;elf, with doing Wrong,
with &s;ome Oppre&s;&s;ion or Injury, either of the
Tongue, or of the Hands.</P>
<P>I might enlarge here upon the Hone&s;ty of the
Tongue, a Thing &s;ome People, who call them|&s;elves
very hone&s;t Men, keep a very &s;lender Guard
upon, I mean, as to Evil-&s;peaking; and of all
Evil-&s;peaking, that wor&s;t Kind of it, the &s;pea|king
hard and unju&s;t Things of one another.</P>
<P>This is certainly intended by the Command
of God, which is &s;o expre&s;s and emphatick, <HI>Thou
&s;halt not bear fal&s;e Witne&s;s again&s;t thy Neighbour;</HI> at
lea&s;t that Part which is what we call Slander, rai|&s;ing
an injurious and fal&s;e Charge upon the Cha|racter
and Conduct of our Neighbour, and &s;prea|ding
it for Truth.</P>
<P>But this is not all; that Hone&s;ty I am &s;peaking
of re&s;pects all Detraction, all outrageous A&s;|&s;aults
of the Tongue; Reproach is as really a Part
of Di&s;hone&s;ty, as Slander; and tho' not &s;o aggra|vated
in Degree, yet 'tis the &s;ame in Kind.</P>
<P>There is a Kind of Murther that may be com|mitted
with the Tongue, that is in its Na|ture
as cruel as that of the Hand: This can
<PB N="30" REF="46">
never be the Practice of an hone&s;t Man; Nay, he
that practi&s;es it cannot be an hone&s;t Man.</P>
<P>But perhaps I may come to this again, but I mu&s;t
go back to explain my &s;elf upon the Subject a lit|tle
farther in the General, and then you &s;hall hear
more of me, as to the Particulars.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Of HONESTY in General.</HEAD>
<P>_I Have always ob&s;erv'd, that however
few the real hone&s;t Men are, yet e|very
Man thinks him&s;elf, and pro|claims
him&s;elf an hone&s;t Man. Ho|ne&s;ty,
like Heaven, has all Mens good Word, and
all Men pretend to a Share of it: So general is the
Claim, that like a Je&s;t which is &s;poil'd by the Re|petition,
'tis grown of no value for a Man <HI>to
&s;wear by his Faith,</HI> which is in its original Mean|ing,
<HI>by his Hone&s;ty,</HI> and ought to be under&s;tood
&s;o.</P>
<P>Like Heaven too, 'tis little under&s;tood by tho&s;e
who pretend mo&s;t to it, 'tis too often &s;quar'd ac|cording
to Mens private Intere&s;t, tho' at the &s;ame
Time the Latitude which &s;ome Men give them|&s;elves,
is incon&s;i&s;tent with its Nature.</P>
<P>Hone&s;ty is a general Probity of Mind, an Apti|tude
to Act ju&s;tly and honourably in all Ca&s;es, re|ligious
and civil, and to all Per&s;ons &s;uperiour or
inferiour; neither is Ability or Di&s;ability to act
&s;o, any Part of the Thing it &s;elf in this Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>It may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd into Ju&s;tice and Equity,
or if you will, into Debt and Honour; for both
make up but one Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="47">
Exact Ju&s;tice is a Debt to all our Fellow-Crea|tures;
and honourable, generous Ju&s;tice is deriv'd
from that golden Rule, <HI>Quod tibi fieri non vis al|teri
ne fe$eris;</HI> and all this put together, makes up
Hone&s;ty: Honour indeed is a higher Word for it,
but 'tis the &s;ame Thing, and
<Q><L>&mdash;Differs from Ju&s;tice only in the Name,</L>
<L>For Hone&s;ty and Honour are the &s;ame.</L></Q></P>
<P>This Hone&s;ty is of &s;o qualifying a Nature,
that 'tis the mo&s;t Denominative of all po&s;&s;ible
Virtues: An <HI>Hone&s;t Man</HI> is the be&s;t Title can be
given in the World; all other Titles are empty
and ridiculous without it, and no Title can be
really &s;candalous if this remain. 'Tis the capital
Letter, by which a Man's Character will be known,
when private Qualities and Accompli&s;hments are
Worm-eaten by Time; without it a Man can
neither be a Chri&s;tian or a Gentleman: A Man may
be a poor hone&s;t Man, an unfortunate hone&s;t Man;
but a Chri&s;tian Knave, or a Gentleman Knave, is
a Contradiction: A Man forfeits his Character
and his Family by Knavery; and his E&s;cutcheon
ought to have a particular Blot, like that of Ba|&s;tardy.
When a Gentleman lo&s;es his Hone&s;ty, he
cea&s;es to be a Gentleman, commences Rake from
that Minute, and ought to be us'd like one.</P>
<P>Hone&s;ty has &s;uch a general Character in the
Minds of Men, that the wor&s;t of Men, who nei|ther
practi&s;e or pretend to any Part of it, will
yet value it in others; no Man ever cou'd be &s;o
out of Love with it, as to de&s;ire his Po&s;terity
&s;hould be without it; nay, &s;uch is the Veneration
all Men have for it, that the general Ble&s;&s;ing of a
Father to his Son, is <HI>Pray, God make thee an hone&s;t
Man.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="48">
Indeed &s;o general is the Value of it, and &s;o well
known, that it &s;eems needle&s;s to &s;ay any Thing in
behalf of it. So far as it is found upon Earth, &s;o
much of the fir&s;t Rectitude of Nature, and of the
Image of God, &s;eems to be re&s;tor'd to Man|kind.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Mi&s;chief which to me &s;eems to
attend this Virtue, like the Thorn about the
Ro&s;e, which pricks the Finger of tho&s;e who med|dle
with it, is <HI>Pride:</HI> 'Tis a hard Thing for a
Man to be very hone&s;t, and not be proud of it;
and tho' he who is really hone&s;t, has, as we &s;ay,
&s;omething to be proud of, yet I take his Hone&s;ty to
be in a great deal of Danger, who values him&s;elf
too much upon it.</P>
<P>True hone&s;t Hone&s;ty, if I may be allow'd &s;uch
an Expre&s;&s;ion, has the lea&s;t Relation to Pride of
any View in the World; 'tis all &s;imple, plain, ge|nuine,
and &s;incere; and if I hear a Man boa&s;t of his
Hone&s;ty, I cannot help having &s;ome Fears for him,
at lea&s;t, that 'tis &s;ickly and langui&s;hing.</P>
<P>Hone&s;ty is a little tender Plant, not known to
all who have Skill in Simples, Thick &s;ow'd, <HI>as they
&s;ay,</HI> and Thin come up; 'tis nice of Growth, it
&s;eldom thrives in a very fat Soil; and yet a very poor
Ground too is apt to &s;tarve it, unle&s;s it has taken
very good Root; when it once takes to a Piece of
Ground, it will never be quite de&s;troy'd; it may
be choak'd with the Weeds of Pro&s;perity, and
&s;ometimes 'tis &s;o &s;corcht up with the Droughts of
Poverty and Nece&s;&s;ity, that it &s;eems as if it were
quite dead and gone; but it always revives upon
the lea&s;t mild Weather; and if &s;ome Showers of
Plenty fall, it makes full Reparation for the Lo&s;s the
Gardener had in his Crop.</P>
<P>There is an ugly Weed, call'd <HI>Cunning,</HI> which
is very pernicious to it, and which particularly
<PB N="33" REF="49">
injures it, by hiding it from our Di&s;corery, and
making it hard to find: This is &s;o like Hone&s;ty,
that many a Man has been deceiv'd with it, and
have taken one for t'other in the Market: Nay,
I have heard of &s;ome, who have planted this <HI>wild
Hone&s;ty,</HI> as we may call it, <HI>in their own Ground,</HI>
have made U&s;e of it in their Friendships and Dea|lings,
and thought it had been the true Plant,
but they always loft Credit by it: And that was
not the wor&s;t; neither; for they had the Lo&s;s who
dealt with them, and who chaffered for a Counter|feit
Commodity; and we find many deceived &s;o
&s;till, which is the Occa&s;ion there is &s;uch an Out|cry
about fal&s;e Friends, and about Sharping and
Tricking in Mens ordinary Dealings in the World.</P>
<P>This true Hone&s;ty too has &s;ome little Difference
in it, according to the Soil or Climate in which
it grows, and your Simplers have had &s;ome Di&s;|putes
about the Sorts of it; Nay, there have been
great Heats about the &s;everal Kinds of this Plant,
which grows in different Countries, and &s;ome call
that <HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI> which others &s;ay, is not; as parti|cularly
they &s;ay, There is a Sort of Hone&s;ty in
my Country, <HI>York&s;hire Hone&s;ty,</HI> which differs very
much from that which is found in the&s;e &s;outhern
Parts about <HI>London:</HI> Then there is a Sort of <HI>Scots</HI>
Hone&s;ty, which they &s;ay is a meaner Sort than
that of <HI>York&s;hire:</HI> And in <HI>New England,</HI> I have
heard they have a kind of Hone&s;ty, which is
wor&s;e than the <HI>Scoti&s;h,</HI> and little better than the
wild Hone&s;ty, call'd <HI>Cunning,</HI> which I mention'd
before. On the other hand, they tell us, that in
&s;ome Parts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and at <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple,</HI>
the <HI>Turks</HI> have a better Sort of Hone&s;ty than
any of us. I am &s;orry, our <HI>Turkey</HI> Company have
not imported &s;ome of it, that we might try whe|ther
it would thrive here or no. 'Tis a little odd
<PB N="34" REF="50">
to me, it &s;hould grow to &s;uch a Perfection in <HI>Tu|key,</HI>
becau&s;e it has always been ob&s;erv'd to thrive
be&s;t, where it is &s;ow'd with a Sort of Grain
call'd <HI>Religion:</HI> Indeed they never thrive in the&s;e
Parts of the World, &s;o well apart, as they do
together. And far this Rea&s;on, I mu&s;t own, I have
found that <HI>Scots</HI> Hone&s;ty, as above, to be of a very
good Kind. How 'tis in <HI>Turkey,</HI> I know not;
for in all my Travels, I never &s;et my Foot in
the Grand Seignior's Dominions.</P>
<P>But to wave Allegories, Di&s;putes about what
is, or is not Hone&s;ty, are dangerous to Hone&s;ty
it &s;elf; for no Ca&s;e can be doubtful, which does
not border upon the Frontiers of Di&s;hone&s;ty; and
he that re&s;olves not to be drowned, had be&s;t ne|ver
come near the Brink of the Water.</P>
<P>That Man who will do nothing but what is barely
hone&s;t, is in great Danger. 'Tis certainly ju&s;t for me
to do every Thing the Law ju&s;tifies; but if I &s;hould
only &s;quare my Actions by what is literally law|ful,
I mu&s;t throw every Debtor, tho' he be poor,
in Pri&s;on, and never relea&s;e him till he has paid the
uttermo&s;t Farthing: I mu&s;t hang every Malefa|ctor
without Mercy, I mu&s;t exact the Penalty of
every, Bond, and the Forfeiture of every Inden|ture:
In &s;hort, I mu&s;t be unea&s;y to all Mankind,
and make them &s;o to me; and in a Word, be a
very Knave too, as well as a Tyrant; for Cruelty
is not Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>Therefore, the &s;overeign Judge of every Man's
Hone&s;ty has laid us down a general Rule, to
which all the Particulars are re&s;olved, <HI>Quod tibi
$word$ n$n vis, alte$i ne feceris.</HI> This is a Part of
that Hone&s;ty I am treating of, and which indeed
is the more e&s;&s;ential of the two; this is the Te&s;t
of Behaviour, and the grand Article to have Re|cour&s;e
to, when Laws are &s;ilent.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="51">
I have heard &s;ome Men argue, that they are
not bound to any &s;uch Considerations of the In|digence
of Per&s;ons, as lead to Conce&s;&s;ions of Time,
or Compo&s;itions with them for Debts; that 'tis
all <HI>ex gratia,</HI> or the Effects of Policy, becau&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances
lead them to judge it better to take
what they can get, than lo&s;e the Whole.</P>
<P>Speaking of the Letter of the Law, I allow that
they may be in the right.</P>
<P>On the other hand, a Man who gives a Bond
for a Debt, pleads, he is an&s;werable for no more
than the Law will force him to; that is, he may
defend a Suit, &s;tand out to the la&s;t Extremity,
and at la&s;t keep out of the Way, &s;o as not to have
Judgment or Execution &s;erv'd on him; he may
&s;ecure his E&s;tate from the Execution, as well as
his Per&s;on, and &s;o never pay the Debt at all; and
yet in the Eye of the Law be an hone&s;t Man; and
this Part of legal literal Hone&s;ty is &s;upported on|ly
by the other, namely, the cruel Part; for real|ly
&s;uch a Man, &s;peaking in the Sen&s;e of common
Ju&s;tice, is a Knave; he ought to act according to
the true Intent and Meaning of his Obligation, and
in the Right of a Debtor to a Creditor, which is
to pay him his Money when it became due, not
&s;tand out to the la&s;t, becau&s;e he cannot be forc'd
to it &s;ooner.</P>
<P>The Laws of the Country indeed allow &s;uch
Actions as the Laws of Con&s;cience can by no
Means allow, as in this Ca&s;e of the Creditor
&s;uing for his Debt, and the Debtor not paying it
till he is forced by Law. The Argument made
U&s;e of to vindicate the Morality of &s;uch a Pra|ctice,
&s;tands thus:</P>
<P>If a Man tru&s;ts me with his Money or Goods,
upon my common Credit, or upon my Word, he
takes me for his Money, and depends both
<PB N="36" REF="52">
upon my Ability and my Hone&s;ty; but if he
comes and demands my, Bond, he quits his De|pendence
upon my Hone&s;ty, and rakes the Law
for his Security; &s;o that the Language of &s;uch an
Action is, He will have a Bond, that it may be
in his Power, to make me pay him, whether I
will or no; and as for my Hone&s;ty, he'll have no|thing
to do with it: What Relief then I can have
again&s;t this Bond, by the &s;ame Law, to which
the Per&s;on refers him&s;elf, is as legal an Action on
my Side, as the other Man's &s;uing for his own,
is on his.</P>
<P>And thus the Letter of the Law will ruine the
Hone&s;ty of both Debitor and Creditor, and yet
both &s;hall be ju&s;tify'd too.</P>
<P>But if I may give my Opinion in this Ca&s;e, nei|ther
of the&s;e are the hone&s;t Man I am &s;peaking of;
for Hone&s;ty does not con&s;i&s;t of Negatives; and
'tis not &s;ufficient to do my Neighbour no per&s;o|nal
Injury in the &s;trict Sen&s;e and Letter of the Law;
but I am bound, where Ca&s;es and Circum&s;tances
make other Mea&s;ures rea&s;onable, to have &s;uch Re|gard
to the&s;e Ca&s;es and Circum&s;tances, as Rea|&s;on
requires. Thus to begin with the Creditor
to the Debtor, Rea&s;on requires, that where a
Man is reduc'd to Extremities, he &s;hould not be
de&s;troy'd for Debt; and what's unreasonable can|not
be hone&s;t.</P>
<P>Debt is no capital Crime, nor ever was; and
&s;tgrving Men in Pri&s;on, a Puni&s;hment wor&s;e than
the Gallows, &s;eems to be a Thing &s;o &s;evere, as
it ought not to be in the Power of a Creditor
to inflict it: The Laws of God never tolerated
&s;uch a Method of treating Debtors, as we have
&s;ince thought proper, I won't &s;ay hone&s;t, to put
in Practice: But &s;ince the Politicks of the Nation
have left the Debtor &s;o much at Mercy by the
<PB N="37" REF="53">
Letter of the Law, 'tis hone&s;t with Re&s;pect to
the Law, to proceed &s;o; yet Compa&s;&s;ion is in
this Ca&s;e thought rea&s;onable, <HI>Why &s;hou'd&s;t thou
take his Bed from under him?</HI> &s;ays the Text; which
implies, 'tis unnatural and unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>I have heard &s;ome Men in&s;i&s;t upon it, that if
a Man be &s;ued wrongfully at Law, he ought ra|ther
to &s;ubmit to the Injury, than to oppo&s;e the
Wrong, by the &s;ame Law; and yet I never found
tho&s;e Gentlemen &s;o pa&s;&s;ive in Matters of Law,
but they would &s;ue a Debtor at Law, if they could
not otherwi&s;e obtain their Right.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I cannot blame them for the la&s;t,
but I blame them for pretending to the fir&s;t:
I am not arguing again&s;t recovering a ju&s;t Debt
by a ju&s;t Law, where the Per&s;on is able, but un|willing
to be hone&s;t: But I think, pur&s;uing the
Debtor to all Extremities, to the turning his Wife
and Children into the Street, expre&s;s'd in the
Scripture by, <HI>Taking his Bed from under him;</HI> and
by keeping the Debtor in Pri&s;on, when really he
is not able to pay it; there is &s;omething of Cruel|ty
in it, and the hone&s;t Man, I am &s;peaking of,
can never do it.</P>
<P>But &s;ome may object, if I mu&s;t &s;erve all Man|kind,
as I would be &s;erv'd in like Ca&s;e, then I
mu&s;t relieve every Beggar, and relea&s;e every poor
Debtor; for if I was a Beggar, I would be re|liev'd;
and if I was in Pri&s;on, I would be releas'd;
and &s;o I mu&s;t give away all I have. This is inver|ting
the Argument; for the Meaning is in the
Negative &s;till, Do not to another any Thing, or
put no Hard&s;hip upon another, which you would
not allow to be ju&s;t, if you were in their
Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Hone&s;ty is Equity, every Man is Lord Chan|cellor
to him&s;elf; and if he would con&s;ult that
<PB N="38" REF="54">
Principle within him, would find Rea&s;on as fair
an Advocate for his Neighbour, as for him|&s;elf:
But I proceed.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Tryal of HONESTY.</HEAD>
<P>N-Ece&s;&s;ity makes an hone&s;t Man a Knave;
and if the World was to be the Judge,
according to the common receiv'd No|tion,
there would not be an hone&s;t poor
Man left alive.</P>
<P>A rich Man is an hone&s;t Man, <HI>no Thanks to
him;</HI> for he would be a double Knave to cheat
Mankind, when he had no Need of it: He has
no Occa&s;ion to pre&s;s upon his Integrity, nor &s;o
much as to touch upon the Borders of Di&s;hone|&s;ty.
Tell me of a Man, that is a very hone&s;t
Man; for he pays every Body punctually, runs
into no body's Debt, does no Man any Wrong;
very well, What Circum&s;tances is he in? Why,
he has a good E&s;tate, a fine yearly Income, and
no Bu&s;ine&s;s to do. The Devil mu&s;t have full Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of this Man, if he &s;houd be a Knave; for
no Man commits Evil for the Sake of it; even the
Devil him&s;elf has &s;ome farther De&s;ign in Sinning,
than barely the wicked Part of it. No Man is
&s;o hardned in Crimes, as to commit them for the
meer Plea&s;ure of the Fact; there is always &s;ome
Vice gratify'd; Ambition, Pride, or Avarice,
make rich Men Knaves, and Nece&s;&s;ity, the Poor:
But to go on with this rich hone&s;t Man; his
Neighbour a thriving Merchant, and who&s;e Ho|ne&s;ty
had as untainted a Character, as he can
<PB N="39" REF="55">
pretend to, has a rich Ship ca&s;t away, or a Fa|ctor
Abroad broke in his Debt, and his Bills
come back prote&s;ted, and he fails, is fain to ab|&s;cond,
and make a Compo&s;ition: Our rich ho|ne&s;t
Man flies out upon him pre&s;ently, he is a
Knave, a Rogue, and don't pay People what he
owes them; and we &s;hould have a Law, That
he that runs into Debt farther than he is able to
pay, &s;hould be hang'd; and the like. If the poor
Man is laid Hold on by &s;ome Creditor, and put
in Pri&s;on; ay, there let him lye, he de&s;erves it;
'twill be an Example to keep others from the
like; and now when all is done, this broken Mer|chant
may be as hone&s;t a Man as the other.</P>
<P>You &s;ay, you are an hone&s;t Man, How do you
know it? Did you ever want Bread, and had
you Neighbour's Loaf in your Keeping, and
would &s;tarve rather than eat it? Was you ever ar|re&s;ted,
and being not able by your &s;elf or Friends,
to make Peace with your Plaintiff, and at the
&s;ame Time having another Man's Money in your
Ca&s;h Che&s;t, committed to your Keeping, &s;uffer'd
your &s;elf to be carry'd to Jayl, rather than break
Bulk, and break in upon your Tru&s;t. God him|&s;elf
has declar'd, That the Power of Extremity
is irre&s;i&s;tible, <HI>and that &s;o,</HI> as to our Integrity,
that he has bid us not <HI>de&s;pi&s;e the Thief</HI> that &s;teals
in &s;uch a Ca&s;e; not that the Man is le&s;s a Thief,
or the Fact le&s;s di&s;hone&s;t: But the Text is mo&s;t
remarkably worded for In&s;truction, in this Point;
Don't you de&s;pi&s;e the Man; But remember, if
you were driven to the &s;ame Exigence, you would
be the &s;ame Man, and do the &s;ame Thing, tho'
now you fancy your Principle &s;o good; therefore,

others to feed on, and eat him? With what Face
could the four look up, and crave a Ble&s;&s;ing on
that Meat? With what Heart give Thanks after
it? And yet this has been done by hone&s;t Men;
and I believe, the hone&s;te&s;t Man in the World
might be forc'd to it; yet here is no Manner of
Pretence, but Nece&s;&s;ity, to palliate the Crime.
If it be argued 'twas the Lo&s;s of one Man to
&s;ave the Four, 'tis an&s;wered, But what Authority
to make him die to &s;ave their Lives? How came
the Man to owe them &s;uch a Debt? 'Twas Rob|bery
and Murder; 'twas robbing him of his Life,
which was his, Property to pre&s;erve mine; 'tis
Murder, by taking away the Life of an innocent
Man; and at be&s;t 'twas doing Evil that Good
may come, which is expre&s;sly forbidden.</P>
<P>But there is a Kind of Equity pleaded in this
Ca&s;e; generally when Men are brought to &s;uch a
Pa&s;s, they ca&s;t Lots who &s;hall be the Man, and
the voluntary Con&s;ent of the Party makes it law|ful
(God him&s;elf being &s;uppos'd to determine who
&s;hall be the Man) which I deny; for it is in no
Man's Power legally to con&s;ent to &s;uch a Lot;
no Man has a Right to give away his own Life;
he may forfeit it to the Law, and loo&s;e it; but
that's a Crime again&s;t him&s;elf, as well as again&s;t
<PB N="41" REF="57">
the Law; and the four Men might by our Law have
been try'd and hang'd for Murder. All that can be
&s;aid is, That Nece&s;&s;ity makes the highe&s;t Crimes
lawful, and Things Evil in their own Nature are
made practicable by it. From the&s;e Extremes
of Nece&s;&s;ity, we come to lighter Degrees of it;
and &s;o let us bring our hone&s;t Man to &s;ome Exieng|cies.
He would not wrong any Man of a Farthing;
he could not &s;leep if he &s;hould be in any body's
Debt; and he cannot be an hone&s;t Man that can.</P>
<P>That we may &s;ee now, whether this Man's
Hone&s;ty lyes any deeper than his Neighbour's,
turn the Scale of his Fortune a little: His
Father left him a good E&s;tate, but here comes
&s;ome Relations, and they trump up a Title to his
Lands, and &s;erve Ejectments upon his Tenants;
and &s;o the Man gets into Trouble, Hurry of
Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the Law: The extravagant Charges
of the Law &s;ink him of all his ready Money, and
his Rents being &s;topp'd, the fir&s;t Breach he makes
upon his Hone&s;ty (<HI>that is, by his former Rules</HI>) he
goes to a Friend to borrow Money, tells him this
Matter will be over he hopes quickly, and he
&s;hall have his Rents to receive, and then he will
pay him again; and really he intends to do &s;o:
But here comes a Di&s;appointment, the Tryal
comes on, and he is ca&s;t, and his Title to the
E&s;tate proves defective; his Father was cheated,
and he not only lo&s;es the E&s;tate, but is call'd up|on
for the Arrears of the Rent he has receiv'd;
and in &s;hort, the Man is undone, and has not a
Penny to buy Bread, or help him&s;elf; and be&s;ides,
this cannot pay the Money he borrowed.</P>
<P>Now, turn to his Neighbour, the Merchant,
whom he had &s;o loudly call'd Knave, for Breaking
in his Trade, he by this Time has made up with
his Creditors, and got Abroad again; and he meets
<PB N="42" REF="58">
him in the Street in his dejected Circum&s;tances,
<HI>Well,</HI> &s;ays the Merchant, <HI>and Why don't you pay
my Cou&s;in, your old Neighbour, the Money you borrow|ed
of him? Truly,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>becau&s;e I have lo&s;t all my
E&s;tate, and can't pay, nay I have nothing to live on.
Well, but,</HI> returns the Merchant, <HI>Wan't you a Knave
to borrow Money, and now can't pay it? Why truly,</HI>
&s;ays the Gentleman, <HI>When I borrowed it, I really
de&s;ign'd to be hone&s;t, and did not que&s;tion but I &s;hould
have my E&s;tate again, and then I had been able al&s;o,
and would have paid him to a Penny, but it has pro|ved
otherwi&s;e; and tho' I would pay him, if I had
it, yet I am not able. Well but,</HI> &s;ays the Merchant
again, <HI>Did you not call me Knave, tho' I lo&s;t my E&s;tate
Abroad, by unavoidable Di&s;a&s;ters, as you have lo&s;t
yours at Home? Did you not upbraid me, becau&s;e I
could not pay? I would have paid every Body, if I
could, as well as you. Why truly,</HI> &s;ays the Gentle|man,
<HI>I was a Fool, I did not con&s;ider what it was
to be brought to Nece&s;&s;ity, I ask you Pardon.</HI></P>
<P>Now, let's carry on this Story: The Mer|chant
compounds with his Creditors, and paying
every one a ju&s;t Proportion, as far as 'twill go,
gets him&s;elf di&s;charg'd; and being bred to Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
and indu&s;trious, falls into Trade, again, and
rai&s;es him&s;elf to good Circum&s;tances; and at la&s;t,
a lucky Voyage, or &s;ome Hit of Trade, &s;ets him
above the World again: The Man remembring
his former Debts, and retaining his Principle
of Hone&s;ty, calls his old Creditors together; and
tho' he was formerly di&s;charg'd from them all, vo|luntarily
pays them the Remainder of their Debts.
The Gentleman being bred to no Bu&s;ine&s;s, and
his Fortune de&s;perate, goes Abroad, and gets in|to
the Army, and behaving him&s;elf well, is made
an Officer; and &s;till ri&s;ing by his Merit, becomes
a great Man, but in his new Condition troubles
<PB N="43" REF="59">
not his Head with his former Debts in his native
Country, but &s;ettles in the Court and Favour of
the Prince, under whom he has made his Fortunes,
and there &s;ets up for the &s;ame hone&s;t Man he did
before.</P>
<P>I think I need not ask which of the&s;e two are
the hone&s;t Man, any more than which was the
hone&s;t Penitent, the Phari&s;ee or the Publican.</P>
<P>Hone&s;ty, like Friend&s;hip, is try'd in Affliction;
and he that cries out loude&s;t again&s;t tho&s;e who in
the Time of this Tryal are forc'd to give Ground,
would perhaps yield as far in the like Shock of
Misfortune.</P>
<P>To be hone&s;t when Peace and Plenty flows
upon our Hands, is owing to the Ble&s;&s;ing of our
Parents; but to be hone&s;t, when Circum&s;tances
grow narrow, Relations turbulent and quarrel|&s;ome,
when Poverty &s;tares at us, and the World
threatens; this Ble&s;&s;ing is from Heaven, and can
only be &s;upported from thence. God Al|mighty
is very little beholding to them, who will
&s;erve him ju&s;t as long as he feeds them. 'Twas
a &s;trong Argument the Devil u&s;ed in that Dia|logue
between Sathan and his Maker about <HI>Job.
Yes he is a mighty good Man, and a mighty ju&s;t
Man, and well he may, while you give him every Thing
he wants: I wou'd &s;erve you my &s;elf, and be as true
to you as</HI> Job, <HI>if you wou'd be as kind and as boun|tiful
to me, as you are to him: But now, do but lay
your Finger on him; do but &s;top your Hand a little, and
cut him &s;hort; &s;trip him a little, and make him like
one of tho&s;e poor Fellows that now bow to him, and you
will quickly &s;ee your good Man be like other Men; nay,
the Pa&s;&s;ion he will be in at his Lo&s;&s;es, will make him
cur&s;e you to your Face.</HI> 'Tis true, the Devil was
mi&s;taken in the Man, but the Argument had a
great deal of Probability in it, and the Moral may
<PB N="44" REF="60">
be drawn, both from the Argument and from the
Con&s;equences.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That 'tis an ea&s;y Thing to maintain the Cha|racter
of Hone&s;ty and Uprightne&s;s, when a Man
has no Bu&s;ine&s;s to be in employ'd in, and no Want
to pre&s;s him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That when Exigences and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es pinch
a Man, then is the Time to prove the Hone&s;ty of
his Principle.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The pro&s;perous hone&s;t Man can only by boa|&s;ting
tell the World he is hone&s;t, but the di&s;tre&s;s'd
and ruin'd hone&s;t Man hears other People tell
him he is hone&s;t.</P>
<P>In this Ca&s;e therefore, &s;ince Allowance mu&s;t
be made for human Infirmities, we are to di|&s;tingui&s;h
between an Accident and a Practice. I
am not pleading to encourage any Man to make
no Scruple of tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon his Hone&s;ty in Time
of Nece&s;&s;ity: But I cannot condemn every Man
for a Knave, who by unu&s;ual Pre&s;&s;ures, Straits,
Difficulties, or other Temptation, has been left
to &s;lip, and do an ill Action, as we call it,
which perhaps this Per&s;on would never have
&s;toop'd to, if the Exigence had not been too
great for his Re&s;olution. The Scripture &s;ays of
<HI>David, He was a Man after God's own Heart;</HI> and
yet we have &s;everal Things recorded of him,
which, according the modern Way of cen&s;uring
People in this Age, would have given him the
Character of a very ill Man: But I conceive, the
Te&s;timony of <HI>David</HI>'s Uprightne&s;s, given us &s;o
authentickly from the Scripture, is given from
this very Rule, That the Inclination of his Heart,
and the general Bent of his Practice, was to &s;erve
and obey his Great Sovereign Benefactor, how|ever,
<PB N="45" REF="61">
human Frailty, back'd with Extremities of
Circum&s;tances, or powerful Temptations, might
betray him, to commit Actions which he would
not otherwi&s;e have done. The Falling into a Crime,
will not denominate a Man di&s;hone&s;t; for <HI>huma|num
e&s;t errare.</HI> The Character of a Man ought
to be taken from the general Tenour of his Be|haviour,
and from his allowed Practice. <HI>David</HI>
took the <HI>Shew-Bread</HI> from the Prie&s;ts, which it
was not lawful for him to eat. <HI>David</HI> knew, that
God, who commanded the <HI>Shew-Bread</HI> &s;hould not
be eaten, had however commanded him by the Law
of Nature, not to be &s;tarv'd; and therefore, pre&s;s'd
by his Hunger, he ventures upon the Commandment.
And the Scripture is very remarkable in expre&s;&s;ing it,
David <HI>when he was an hungry:</HI> And the Occa&s;ion for
which our Ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf quoted this Text,
is very remarkable. <HI>viz.</HI> to prove, that Things
otherwi&s;e unlawful, may be made lawful by Ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
<HI>Matth.</HI> xii. 4.</P>
<P>Another Time, <HI>David</HI> in his Pa&s;&s;ion re&s;olves
the De&s;truction of <HI>Nabal</HI> and all his Family,
which, without Doubt, was a great Sin; and
the Principle which he went upon, <HI>to wit,</HI> Re|venge
for his churli&s;h and &s;aucy An&s;wer to him,
was &s;till a greater Sin; but the Temptation back'd
by the Strength of his Pa&s;&s;ion, had the better of him
at that Time: And this upright hone&s;t Man had
murder'd <HI>Nabal</HI> and all his Hou&s;e, if God had
not prevented him.</P>
<P>Many In&s;tances of like Nature the Scripture
has left upon Record, giving Te&s;timony to the
Character of good Men, from the general Practice
and Bent of their Hearts, without leaving any
Reproach upon them for particular Failings, tho'
tho&s;e Sins have been extraordinary provoking, and
in their Circum&s;tances &s;candalous enough.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="62">
If any Man would be &s;o weak as from hence
to draw Encouragement to allow him&s;elf in ea&s;y
Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es upon his Hone&s;ty, on the Pretence of
Nece&s;&s;ities, let him go on with me to the fur|ther
End of this Ob&s;ervation, and find room for
it if he can.</P>
<P>If ever the hone&s;t Man I &s;peak of, by what|&s;oever
Exigence or Weakne&s;s, thus &s;lips from the
Principle of his Integrity, he never fails to ex|pre&s;s
his own Di&s;like of it; he acknowledges up|all
Occa&s;ions, both to God and to Man, his
having been overcome, and been prevail'd upon
to do, what he does not approve of; he is too
much a&s;ham'd of his own Infirmity, to pretend
to vindicate the Action, and he certainly is re|&s;tor'd
to the fir&s;t Regulation of his Principles, as
&s;oon as the Temptation is over. No Man is
fonder to accu&s;e him than he is to accu&s;e him&s;elf,
and he has always upon him the &s;incere Marks
of a Penitent.</P>
<P>'Tis plain from hence, that the Principle of
the Man's Integrity is not de&s;troy'd, however;
he may have fallen, tho' &s;even times a Day;
and I mu&s;t while I live reckon him for an hone&s;t
Man.</P>
<P>Nor am I going about to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Ex|tremities
and Exigencies which have pre&s;s'd Men
of the be&s;t Principles, to do what at another time
they would not do, make tho&s;e Actions become
le&s;s Sinful, either in their own Nature or Circum|&s;tances.
The Guilt of a Crime with re&s;pect to
its being a Crime, <HI>viz.</HI> an Offence again&s;t God, is
not removed by the Circum&s;tances of Nece&s;&s;ity.
It is without Doubt a Sin for me to &s;teal ano|ther
Man's Food, tho' it was to &s;upply Starving
Nature; for how do I know whether he who&s;e
Food I &s;teal may not be in as much Danger of
<PB N="47" REF="63">
Starving for want of it, as I; and <HI>if not,</HI> 'tis taking
to my own U&s;e what I have no Right to, and
taking it by Force or Fraud; and the Que&s;tion
is not as to the Right or Wrong, whether I have
a Nece&s;&s;ity to eat this Man's Bread or no; but
whether it be his or my own? If it be his, and
not my own, I cannot do it without a manife&s;t
Contempt of God's Law, and breaking the
Eighth Article of it, <HI>Thou &s;halt not Steal.</HI> Thus
as to God, the Crime is evident, let the Nece&s;&s;ity
be what it will.</P>
<P>But when we are con&s;idering human Nature
&s;ubjected by the Con&s;equences of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion,
to Frailty and Infirmity; and regarding
things from Man to Man, the Exigencies and Ex|tremities
of &s;treightned Circum&s;tances &s;eem to
me to be mo&s;t prevailing Arguments, why the
Denomination of a Man's general Character ought
not, <HI>by his fellow Mortals (&s;ubject to the &s;ame
Infirmities)</HI> to be gathered from his Mi&s;takes, his
Errors or Failings, no not from his being guilty
of any extraordinary Sin, but from the Manner
and Method of his Behaviour. Does he go on
to commit Frauds, and make a Practice of his
Sin? Is it a Di&s;tre&s;s? Is it a Storm of Affliction,
and Poverty has driven him upon the Lee Shore
of Temptation? Or is the Sin the Port he &s;teer'd
for? A Ship may by Stre&s;s of Weather be driven
upon Sands and dangerous Places, and the Skill
of the Pilot not be blameable; but he that runs
again&s;t the Wind, and without any Nece&s;&s;ity,
upon a Shelve which he &s;ees before him, mu&s;t do
do it on purpo&s;e to de&s;troy the Ve&s;&s;el, and ruine
the Voyage.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, if no Man can be call'd hone&s;t, but
he who is never overcome, to fall into any Breach
of this Rectitude of Life; none but he who
<PB N="48" REF="64">
is &s;ufficiently fortified again&s;t all Po&s;&s;ibility of
being tempted by pro&s;pects, or driven by Di&s;tre&s;s,
to make any Tre&s;pa&s;s upon his Integrity; Woe be
unto me that Write, and to mo&s;t that Read, where
&s;hall we find the hone&s;t Man?</P>
<P>The Scripture is particularly expre&s;&s;ive of this
in the <HI>The Righteous Man falleth &s;even times
a Day, and ri&s;eth again.</HI> Why, this is very &s;trange,
if a Man come, to commit &s;even Crimes in a Day,
that is, many, for the Meaning is Indefinite, can
this be an hone&s;t Man?: What &s;ays the World of
him? Hang him, he is a Knave, a Ra&s;cal, a Di&s;|hone&s;t
Fellow; this is the Judgment of Men: But
in the Judgment of Scripture this may be a
Righteous Man.</P>
<P>The main De&s;ign, of this Head and the proper
Application of it is, to tell us we ought not be
too ha&s;ty to Brand our Brother for his Sins,
his Infirmities or Misfortunes, &s;nce he that is Di&s;|hone&s;t
in your Eyes, by a ca&s;ual or other Crime
which he Commits, may ri&s;e from that Di&s;a&s;ter
by a &s;incere Repentance, and be to morrow an
hone&s;ter Man than thy &s;elf in the Eyes of his
Maker.</P>
<P>But here I am a&s;&s;aulted with another cen&s;o|rious
hone&s;t Man; here you talk of falling to
Day, and ri&s;ing again to Morrow; Sinning and
Repenting; why here is a Fellow has cheated me
of 500 <HI>l.</HI> and he comes canting to me of his Re|pentance,
tells me he hopes God has forgiven
him; and it would be hard for me to call to Re|membrance
what God has wip'd out; he is
heartily &s;orry for the Fault, and the like, and
begs my Pardon, that is, begs my E&s;tate indeed:
For what's all this to my Money, let him pay me
and I'll forgive him too; God may forgive him
the Sin, but that's nothing to my Debt.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="65">
Why truly, in An&s;wer to this in Part, you are
in the Right if the Man be able to make you any
Satisfaction, and does not do it; for I que&s;tion
not, but every Tre&s;pa&s;s of this Nature requires
Re&s;titution, as well as Repentance; Re&s;titution as
far as the po&s;&s;ible Power of the Party extends; and
if the la&s;t be not found, the fir&s;t is not likely to
be &s;incere.</P>
<P>But if the Man, either is not able to make you
any Re&s;titution at all, or does make you Re&s;tituti|on
to the utmo&s;t of his Capacity, and then comes
and &s;ays as before; then the Poor Man is in
the Right, and you in the Wrong; for I make no
Que&s;tion likewi&s;e to affirm, and could prove it by
unan&s;werable Arguments, <HI>He may be an Hone&s;t Man
who cannot pay his Debts, but he cannot be an Hone&s;t
Man who can, and does not.</HI></P>
<P>Innumerable Accidents reduce Men from Plen|tiful
Fortunes to mean and low Circum&s;tances;
&s;ome procur'd by their own Vices and Intempe|rance,
&s;ome by Infirmities, Ignorance, and meer
want of Judgment to manage their Affairs:
Some by the Frauds and Cheats of other Men,
&s;ome by meer Ca&s;ualty and unavoidable Acci|dents,
wherein the Sovereignty of Providence
&s;hews us, that the Race is not to the Swift, or
the Battle to the Strong, or Riches to Men of
Under&s;tanding.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Some by Vices and Intemperance are re|duc'd
to Poverty and Di&s;tre&s;s: Our Hone&s;t Man
cannot fall in the Misfortunes of th$s Cla&s;s, be|cau&s;e
there the very Poverty is a Sin, being produc'd
from a &s;inful Cau&s;e. As its far from being al|low'd,
as an Excu&s;e to a Murtherer, to &s;ay he
was in Drink, becau&s;e it is excu&s;ing a Crime
with a Crime: So for a Man to ruin his For|tunes,
as the Prodigal in the Go&s;pel, with riot|ous
<PB N="50" REF="66">
Living, all the Effects are wicked and di&s;|hone&s;t,
as they partake of the Di&s;hone&s;ty of the
Cau&s;e from whence they proceed: For he cannot
be an hone&s;t Man, who wants wherewith to pay
his Debts, after having &s;pent what &s;hould have
di&s;charg'd them, in Luxury and Debauches.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Some by Ignorance and want of Judg|ment
to manage their Affairs, are brought to
Poverty and Di&s;tre&s;s; the&s;e may be hone&s;t Men,
notwith&s;tanding their Weakne&s;s, for I won't un|dertake
that none of our hone&s;t Men &s;hall be
Fools: 'Tis true the good Man, is the wi&s;e Man,
as to the main Part of Wi&s;dom, which is in|cluded
in his Piety, but many a Religious Man
who would not do any Wrong wilfully to his
Neighbour, is oblig'd at la&s;t to injure both his
own Family, and other People's, for want of Di&s;|cretion
to guide him in his Affairs, and to judge for
him&s;elf: and therefore I dare not Tax all our
Fools with being Knaves, nor will I &s;ay but &s;uch a
Man may be Hone&s;t. Some will &s;ay, but &s;uch
a Man &s;hould not venture into Bu&s;ine&s;s, which he
is not able to manage, and therefore 'twas the
Vice of his Under&s;tanding, and like the Ca&s;e in
the fir&s;t Article, is excu&s;ing a Fault with a
Fault.</P>
<P>I cannot allow this, for if I am askt why a
Fool ventures into Trade, I an&s;wer, becau&s;e he
is a Fool, not becau&s;e he is a Knave.</P>
<Q><L>If Fools could their own Ignorance di&s;cern,</L>
<L>They'd be no longer Fools, becau&s;e they'd learn.</L></Q>
<P>If you would convince a Man that he wants
Di&s;cretion, you mu&s;t give him Di&s;cretion to be
convinc'd: 'Till then he cannot know he has it
not, becau&s;e he has it not. No Man is an&s;werable,
<PB N="51" REF="67">
either to God or Man, for that which he never
was Ma&s;ter of: The mo&s;t proper Expre&s;&s;ion
that ever I met with in this Nature, was of a
certain Ideot or Natural, which a Gentleman
of my Acquaintance kept in his Family, who
being on his Death-Bed, was ob&s;erv'd to be very
pen&s;ive, and much concern'd about dying; the
Gentleman &s;ent a Mini&s;ter to him, who as well
as he could to his Under&s;tanding, di&s;cour&s;ed with
him about Death and Judgment to come; the
poor Creature who was hardly ever able to give
a rational An&s;wer to a Que&s;tion before, after
hearing him very attentively, broke out into
Tears with this Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>That he hoped God would
not require any Thing of him, that he had not given
him Judgment to under&s;tand.</HI> Whatever it may be
as to the Soul, I am po&s;itive in the Ca&s;e of human
Affairs, no Man is an&s;werable to Man for any
more than his Di&s;cretion; Events are not in our
Power, a Man may be nicely Hone&s;t in Life, tho'
he may be weak enough in Judgment.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Some are ruin'd, and are yet merely
pa&s;&s;ive, being either defrauded and cheated by
Knaves, or plundered and rifled by Thieves, or
by immediate Ca&s;ualties, as Fire, Enemies, Storms,
Floods, and the like; the&s;e are Things which nei|ther
touch the Man's Hone&s;ty, nor his Di&s;cre|tion.
Thus <HI>Job</HI> was by God's Permi&s;&s;ion and
the Agency of the Devil, reduc'd in a Moment
from a plentiful E&s;tate to be as naked as he
came out of his Mother's Womb: I would fain
ask tho&s;e who &s;ay, no Man can be an hone&s;t
Man if he does not pay his Debts, who paid
<HI>Job</HI>'s Debts if he own'd any, and where was his
Di&s;hone&s;ty, if he did not pay them? I &s;till rea|dily
grant that he cannot be an hone&s;t Man who
does not pay his Debts if he can; but if other|wi&s;e,
<PB N="52" REF="68">
then the Words ought to be altered, and
they &s;hould &s;ay, he cannot be an hone&s;t Man
who borrows any Money, or buys any Thing up|on
his Credit, and this cannot be true.</P>
<P>But &s;ince I have led my&s;elf into the Argument,
I cannot but make a &s;mall Digre&s;&s;ion concerning
People who fail in Trade: I conceive the greate&s;t
Error of &s;uch is their Terror about Breaking, by
which they are tempted while their Credit is
good, tho' their Bottom be naught, to pu&s;h far|ther
in; expecting, or at lea&s;t hoping, by the Pro|fits
of &s;ome happy Voyage, or &s;ome lucky Hit,
as they call it, to retrieve their Circum&s;tances,
and &s;tand their Ground.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I cannot vindicate the Hone&s;ty
of this; for he, who knowing his Circum&s;tances
to be once naught, and his Bottom worn out;
ought not in Ju&s;tice to enter into any Man's Debt;
for Then he Trades on their Ri&s;que, not on his
own, and yet Trades for his own Profits, not
theirs; this is not fair, becau&s;e he deceives the
Creditor, who ventures his E&s;tate on that Bot|tom
which he &s;uppo&s;es to be good, and the o|ther
knows is not. Nay, tho' he really pays
this Creditor, he is not hone&s;t; for in Con&s;ci|ence,
his former Creditors had a Right to all
his Effects, in Proportion to their Debts; and if
he really pays one all, and the re&s;t but a Share,
'tis a Wrong to the whole.</P>
<P>I would therefore advi&s;e all Trade&s;men, who
find their Circum&s;tances declining, as &s;oon, at
lea&s;t, as they fir&s;t di&s;cern them&s;elves to be unca|pable
of paying their Debts, if not, while yet
they can pay every one all, make a full Stop,
and call all People together; if there is enough
to pay them all, let them have it, if not, let
them have their ju&s;t Shares of it; by this Means
<PB N="53" REF="69">
you will certainly have God's Ble&s;&s;ing, and the
Character of an hone&s;t Man, left to begin again
with; and Creditors are often prevail'd with, in
Consideration of &s;uch a generous Hone&s;ty, to
$arow back &s;omething to put &s;uch a Man in a
Po&s;ture to live again; or by further voluntary Cre|dit
and Friendship, to uphold him. This is much
better al&s;o with re&s;pect to Intere&s;t, as well as Ho|ne&s;ty,
than to run on to all Extremities, till the
Burthen falls too heavy, either for Debtor or
Creditor to bear: This would prevent many of
the Extremities, which, I &s;ay, puts the Hone&s;ty
of a Man to &s;o extraordinary a Tryal.</P>
<P>An hone&s;t Principle would certainly dictate to
the Man, if it were con&s;ulted with, that when
he knows he is not able to pay, it is not lawful
for him to borrow. Taking Credit is a Promi&s;e
of Payment; a Promi&s;e of Payment is tacitly
under&s;tood, and he cannot be hone&s;t who promi&s;es
what he knows he cannot perform, as I &s;hall
note more at large on another Head. But if the
Man be paid, yet it was not an hone&s;t Act;
'twas deceiving the Man, and making him run a
greater Ri&s;que than he knew of, and &s;uch a Ri&s;que
as he would not have run, had he known your
Circum&s;tances and Bottom, as you do; &s;o that
here is Deceit upon Deceit.</P>
<P>This I know is a di&s;puted Point, and a Thing
which a great many practi&s;e, who pa&s;s for very ho|ne&s;t
Men in the World; but I like it not the better
for that; I am very po&s;itive, that he who takes
my Goods on the Foot of his Credit, when if
he &s;hould dye the next Day, he knows his E&s;tate
will not pay me five Shillings in the Pound;
tho' he &s;hould not dye, but does pay me at the
Time appointed, is as much guilty of a Fraud,
as if he actually robb'd my Hou&s;e. Credit is a
<PB N="54" REF="70">
receiv'd Opinion of a Man's Hone&s;ty and Abili|ty,
his Willingne&s;s to pay, and his having where|with
to pay; and he who wants either of the&s;e,
his Credit is &s;ame. Men won't &s;ell their Goods
to a litigious quarrel&s;ome Man, tho' he be never
&s;o rich, nor to a needy Man, tho' he be never
&s;o hone&s;t. Now, if all the World believe I
am hone&s;t and able, and I know I am not the
la&s;t, I cannot be the fir&s;t, if I take their Goods
upon Credit; 'tis vain to pretend, Men Trade
upon the general Ri&s;que of Mens Appearance,
and the Credit of common Fame, and all Men
have an equal Hazard. <HI>I &s;ay no:</HI> Men may ven|ture
their E&s;tates in the Hands of a flourishing
Bankrupt, and he by Virtue of his yet un&s;haken
Credit is tru&s;ted; but he cannot be hone&s;t that
takes this Credit, becau&s;e he knows his Circum|&s;tances
are quite otherwi&s;e than they are &s;up|pos'd
to be, that the Man is deceiv'd, and he is
privy to the Deceit.</P>
<P>This Digre&s;&s;ion is not &s;o remote from the pur|po&s;e,
as I expected, when I began it; the Hone&s;ty
that I am &s;peaking of, chiefly re&s;pects Matters
of Commerce, of when Credit and Payment of
Debt are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Branches.</P>
<P>There is another Article in Trade, which
many very hone&s;t Men have made familiar to
Themselves, which yet I think, is in no Ca&s;e to
be defended; and that is relating to Counterfeit
Money. Cu&s;tom, before the old Money was
&s;uppre&s;s'd in <HI>England,</HI> had prevail'd &s;o far upon
Hone&s;ty, that I have &s;een &s;ome Men put all their
Bra&s;s Money among their runing Ca&s;h, to be told
over in every Sum they paid, in Order to have
&s;omebody or other take it; I have heard many
People own they made no Scruple of it, but I
could never find them give one good Rea&s;on to
ju&s;tify the Hone&s;ty of it.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="71">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> They &s;ay it comes for Money, and it
ought to go &s;o: To which I An&s;wer, that is
ju&s;t as good a Rea&s;on as this: <HI>A</HI> has cheated me,
and therefore I may Cheat <HI>B.</HI> If I have receiv|ed
a Sum of Money for good, and knowing not
that any, of it is otherwi&s;e, offer it in Payment to
another: This is Ju&s;t and Hone&s;t; but, if on this
other Man's telling it over, he returns me a Piece
of Bra&s;s or Counterfeit Money which I change
again, and afterwards knowing, this to be &s;uch,
offer the &s;ame Piece to another: I know no wor&s;e
Fraud in its Degree in the World, and I doubt
not to prove it &s;o beyond Contradiction.</P>
<P>If the fir&s;t Per&s;on did not take this Piece of
Money, it was becau&s;e being both watchful and
skilful, he could di&s;cover it; and if I offer it
to another 'tis with an Expectation, that he being
either le&s;s watchful or le&s;s skillful, &s;hall overlook
it, and &s;o I &s;hall make an Advantage of my
Neighbour's Ignorance, or want of Care.</P>
<P>I'll put &s;ome parallel Ca&s;es to this, to illu&s;trate
it: Suppo&s;e a blind Man comes into a Shop to
buy Goods of me, and giving me a Guinea to
change, I &s;hall give him the Remainder in bad Mo|ney;
would not every Body &s;ay 'twas a barbarous
Thing? Why the other is all one, for if the Per&s;on
be ignorant of Money, he is blind as to the Point
in Hand; and nothing can be more unfair than
to take the Advantage.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e again a young Boy, or a Servant new|ly
entred in Trade, is &s;ent to buy Goods, and
by his Ma&s;ter's Order, he asks for &s;uch a Com|modity;
and you pre&s;uming upon the Rawne&s;s
of the Me&s;&s;enger, deliver a Sort of a meaner
Quality, and take the full Price of him; would
you grudge to be u&s;ed &s;curvily for &s;uch a Trick$
Why, no le&s;s or better is Offering Bra&s;s for Silver,
<PB N="56" REF="72">
pre&s;uming only the want of Care or Skill in the
Receiver, &s;hall pa&s;s it unob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>Ay, but &s;ays a learned Trade&s;man who would be
thought hone&s;ter than ordinary; I always change
it again, if it be brought back: Yes Sir, &s;o does a
Pick-Pocket give you your Handkerchief again
when you have fa&s;ten'd on him, and threaten'd him
with the Mob. The Matter in &s;hort is this; if
the Man whom you have cheated, can cheat no
Body el&s;e, then no Thanks to you; when he
comes to you, and charges the Fraud upon you,
you'll make Sat$isfaction, becau&s;e if you won't,
the Law will compel you to it.</P>
<P>But if the Fraud may be carried on, as you
are manife&s;tly willing, con&s;enting, and in&s;trumen|tal
in it that it &s;hould; behold the Con&s;equence,
your fir&s;t &s;in again&s;t Hone&s;ty is multiplied in all
the Hands thro' whom this Piece of bad Money
knowingly &s;o pa&s;&s;es, till at la&s;t it happens to go
&s;ingle to a poor Man that can't put it off, and
the Wrong and Injury may i&s;&s;ue where it was
wanted to buy Bread for a &s;tarving Family.</P>
<P>All the Excu&s;es I could ever meet with could
never &s;atisfy me, that it can con&s;i&s;t with Hone&s;ty,
to put Bra&s;s or Copper away for Gold or Silver,
any more than it would, to give a blind Me&s;&s;en|ger
Sand in&s;tead of Sugar? or brown Bread in&s;tead

<HEAD>Of HONESTY in Promi&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>_A <HI>Man is known by his Word, and an Ox by
his Horns,</HI> &s;ays an old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Proverb.
If I understand the true Meaning of it,
'tis, that the Hone&s;ty of a Man is known
by his punctual ob&s;erving his Word, as naturally
and plainly as any Creature is known by the
mo&s;t obvious Di&s;tinction. 'Tis the peculiar
Quality of an hone&s;t Man, the di&s;tingui&s;hing
Mark to know him by. His Word or Promi&s;e is
as &s;acred to him in all his Affairs in the World,
as the &s;tronge&s;t Obligation which can be laid on
him; nor is it a Thing form'd by him from &s;et|tled
Re&s;olutions, or Mea&s;ures of Policy taken
up of cour&s;e to rai&s;e or fix his Reputation; but
'tis the native Produce of his hone&s;t Principle:
'Tis the Con&s;equence, and his Hone&s;ty is the
Cau&s;e; he cea&s;es to be Hone&s;t, when he cea&s;es
to pre&s;erve this &s;olemn Regard to his Word.</P>
<P>If he gives his Word, any Man may depend
upon it, for the Safety of his Life or E&s;tate; he
&s;corns to prevaricate or &s;hift him&s;elf off from the
punctual Ob&s;ervance of it, tho it be to his Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>I can't abate an hone&s;t Man an Inch in the pun|ctual
Ob&s;ervance of a Promi&s;e made upon Parole,
if it be in the Man's po&s;&s;ible Power to perform
it, becau&s;e there &s;eems to be &s;omething too ba&s;e
to con&s;i&s;t with Hone&s;ty in the very Nature of a
Man that can go back from his Word.</P>
<P>The Reverence our Ance&s;tors paid to their
Promi&s;es, or Word pa&s;t, I am of the Opinion,
<PB N="58" REF="74">
gave that remarkable Brand of Infamy and Scan|dal
upon the Affront of giving the Lie; <HI>a Gentle|man,</HI>
which is, in &s;hort, the modern Term for <HI>an
hone&s;t Man,</HI> or, a Man of Honour, cannot receive
a greater Reproach, than to be told, <HI>he lies;</HI> that
is, that he forfeits his Word, breaks his Veraci|ty;
for the Minute he does that, he ungentlemans
him&s;elf, di&s;graces the Blood of his Family, de|generates
from his Ance&s;tors, and commences
Rake, Scoundrel, and any Thing.</P>
<P>Some People, who have run their Points of Ho|nour
to the Extreams, are of the Opinion, that
this Affront of the Lie ought not to be given to
any Thing they, call a Gentleman, or that calls
him&s;elf &s;o, till he has &s;o far expo&s;ed him&s;elf to
all other Degrees of Infamy, as to bear Kicking,
or Caning, and the like; that after this, when he
breaks his Word, he may be told, <HI>he lies,</HI> or any
Thing el&s;e; but till then, the very Thing it &s;elf
is &s;o intolerable an Abu&s;e, that the Per&s;on who
ventures to tre&s;pa&s;s &s;o foully on the Rules of good
Manners, de&s;erves not the Honour of fair Play
for his Life: But as &s;ome Bea&s;ts of Prey are refu|&s;ed
the fair Law of the Field, and are knock'd
down in every Hedge; &s;o the&s;e, like Bullies and
meer Rakes, may be pi&s;tol'd in the Dark, and
&s;tabb'd at the Corner of an Alley; that is to &s;ay,
any lea&s;ure may be u&s;ed with them, to di&s;mi&s;s
them from the Society of Mankind, as Fellows
not &s;ufferable in the Common-wealth of good
Manner's.</P>
<P>I do not argue for the&s;e Extremes; but I in|&s;tance
in this, to te&s;tify the Veneration all good
Men have for the Word or Promi&s;e of an hone&s;t
Men, and the E&s;teem which the Integrity of the Mind
expre&s;s'd by a zealous Regard to the Words of
the Mouth, have obtain'd in the World. The
<PB N="59" REF="75">
<HI>French,</HI> when they expre&s;s them&s;elves in Vindica|tion
of their Honour, always bring it about by
this, <HI>Je &s;uis homme de Parole,</HI> I am an hone&s;t
Man, or a Man of my Word; that is, I am a
Man that may be tru&s;ted upon my Parole; for I
never break my Word.</P>
<P>Such was the Value put upon the Promi&s;es of
Men in former Time, that a Promi&s;e of Payment
of Money was recoverable in put Courts by Law,
till the Inconveniencies prov'd &s;o many, that an
Act was made on Purpo&s;e to re&s;train it to a Sum
under ten Pounds: But to this Day, if a Man
promi&s;es Marriage to a Woman, e&s;pecially if &s;he
has granted him any Favours upon that Condition,
the Laws of the Land, which therein have Re|gard
to the Laws of Honour, will oblige him to
make it good, and allow it to be a &s;ufficient Plea
to forbid his marrying with any body el&s;e.</P>
<P>There are innumerable In&s;tances of the Vene|ration
all Nations pay to the expre&s;&s;ive Article of
human Veracity. In the War, you meet with
frequent In&s;tances of Pri&s;oners di&s;mi&s;s'd by a ge|nerous
Enemy, upon their Parole, either to pay
their Ran&s;om, or to procure &s;uch or &s;uch Condi|tions
or come back and &s;urrender them&s;elves Pri|&s;oners;
and he that &s;hould forfeit this Parole,
wou'd be po&s;ted in the Enemy's Army, and hi&s;s'd
out of his own.</P>
<P>I know nothing a wi&s;e Man would not chu&s;e
to do, rather than by breaking his Word, give
the World &s;uch an undeniable Te&s;timony of his
being a Knave; This is that good Name which
<HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays <HI>is better than Life, and is a precious
Ointment, and which, when a Man has once lo&s;t, he
has nothing left worth keeping.</HI> A Man may even
hang him&s;elf out of the Way; for no Man that
looks like a Man, will keep his Company.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="76">
When a Man has once come to breaking his
Words no Mau, that has any Value for his Re|putation,
cares to be &s;een in his Company; but all
good Men &s;hun him, as if he were infected with
the Plague.</P>
<P>There are Men indeed, who will be exceeding
punctual to their Words and Promi&s;es, who yet
cannot be call'd hone&s;t Men, becau&s;e they have
other Vices and Excur&s;ions that render them other
Ways wicked: The&s;e give their Te&s;timony to
the Beauty of Hone&s;ty, by chu&s;ing it as the be&s;t
Mask to put a Glo&s;s upon their Actions, and con|ceal
the other Deformities of their Lives; and &s;o
Hone&s;ty, like Religion, is made U&s;e of to di&s;|gui&s;e
the Hypocrite, and rai&s;e a Reputation upon
the Shadow, by the Advantage it takes of the
real E&s;teem the World has of the Sub&s;tance: I &s;ay
of this Counterfeit-Hone&s;ty, as is &s;aid of Religi|on
in like Ca&s;es. If Hone&s;ty was not the mo&s;t ex|cellent
Attainment, 'twould not be made U&s;e or
as the mo&s;t &s;pecious Pretence; nor is there a more
exqui&s;ite Way for a Man to play the Hypocrite,
than to pretend an extraordinary Zeal to the
Performance of his Promi&s;es; becau&s;e, when the
Opinion of any Man's Hone&s;ty that Way, has
&s;pread in the Thoughts of Men, there is nothing
&s;o great, but they will tru&s;t him with, nor &s;o
hard, but they will do it for him.</P>
<P>All Men reverence an hone&s;t Man; the Knaves
&s;tand in Awe of him, Fools adore him, and wi&s;e
Men love him; and thus is Virtue its own
ward.</P>
<P>Hone&s;t Men are in more Danger from this one
Hypocrite, than from 20 open Knaves; for the&s;e
have a Mark plac'd upon them by their general
Character, as a Buoy upon a Rock to warn Stran|gers
from venturing upon it: But the Hypocrites are
<PB N="61" REF="77">
like a Pit cover'd over, like Shoals under Water,
and Danger concealed which cannon be &s;een. I
mu&s;t confe&s;s, I have found the&s;e the mo&s;t dan|gerous,
and have too deeply &s;uffer'd by throwing
my&s;elf on their Prote&s;tations of Hone&s;ty: The
E&s;teem I always entertain'd of the mo&s;t beautiful
Gift God has be&s;tow'd, or Man could receive, has
made me the ea&s;ier to be deceiv'd with the Re|&s;emblance
of it.</P>
<P>So much as I, or any one el&s;e, by the Vitiou&s;|ne&s;s
of our own Nature, or the prevailing Force of
Accidents, Snares, and Temptations, have devia|ted
from this &s;hining Principle, to far we have been
fooli&s;h, as well as wicked; &s;o much we have to
repent of towards our Maker, and be a&s;ham'd of
towards our Neighbour.</P>
<P>For my Part, I am never backward to own,
let who will be the Reader of the&s;e Sheets, that
to the Di&s;honour of my Maker, and the ju&s;t Scan|dal
of my own Hone&s;ty, I have not paid that due
Regard to the Rectitude of this Principle, which
my own Knowledge has own'd to be its due; let
tho&s;e who have been ju&s;ter to them&s;elves, and
to the Giver of it, rejoice in the Happine&s;s, ra|ther
than triumph over the Infirmity.</P>
<P>But let them be &s;ure, they have been ju&s;ter on
their own Parts; let them be po&s;itive, that their
own Integrity is untainted, and would abide all
the Tryals and Racks, that a ruin'd Fortune,
&s;trong Temptations, and deep Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, could
bring it into: Let them not boa&s;t till the&s;e Dan|gers
are pa&s;t, and they put their Armour off; and
if they can do it then, I will freely acknowledge,
they have le&s;s need of Repentance than I.</P>
<P>Not that I pretend, as I noted before, and

<P>And &s;uch is the Folly of Scandal, as well as
the Blindne&s;s of Malice, that it &s;eldom fixes Re|proach
upon the right Foot: I have &s;een &s;o much
of it, with re&s;pect to other People, as well
as my &s;elf, that it gives me a very &s;coundrel Opi|nion
of all tho&s;e People whom I find forward to
load their Neighbours with Reproach. Nothing
is more frequent in this Ca&s;e, than to run away
with a Piece of a Man's Character, in which
they err, and do him Wrong; and leave that Part
of him untouch'd which is really black, and
would bear it; this makes me &s;ometimes,
when with the humble&s;t and mo&s;t aba&s;ing
Thoughts of my &s;elf, I look up, and betwixt
God and my own Soul, cry out, <HI>What a Wretch

his Principle, and this becau&s;e as I &s;aid, I &s;hould
chiefly regard this Hone&s;ty, as it concerns human
Affairs Conversation, and Negotiation.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="80">
And here I meet with a Tradesman come
ju&s;t in from dunning one of his Neighbours:
Well, I have been at a Place for Money, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> but
I can get none; there's &s;uch a one, he pa&s;&s;es for an
hone&s;t Man, but I am &s;ure he is a great Rogue to
me, for he has promised me my Money a long
Time, but puts me off &s;till From Time to Time;
he makes no more of breaking his Word, than
of drinking a Gla&s;s of Beer. I am &s;ure he has
told me forty Lies already; this is one of your
hone&s;t Men, if all &s;uch hone&s;t Men were hang'd we
&s;hould have a better Trade; and thus he runs on.</P>
<P>If all &s;uch hone&s;t Men were hang'd, they that
were left might have a better Trade, but how
many of them would there be?</P>
<P>Now tho' I &s;hall no Way vindicate Mens ha&s;ty
Promi&s;es ab&s;olutely to perform what is doubtful
in the Event, yet I cannot agree, that every Man
who having promis'd a Payment, does not per|form
it, to his Time, is a Knave or a Lyar; if it
were &s;o, the Lord have Mercy upon three Parts
of the City.</P>
<P>Wherefore, to &s;tate this Matter clearly, it mu&s;t
be taken a little to Pieces, and the Articles &s;po|ken
to apart.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Without Que&s;tion, when a Man makes a
Promi&s;e of Payment to another on a &s;et Day, know|ing
in his own Thoughts that it is not probable he
&s;hould be capable to comply with it, or really
de&s;igning not to comply with it, or not endea|vouring
to comply with it: 'Tis a Deceit put
upon the Parry, 'tis a premeditated formal Lye,
the Man that made it is a Stranger to Hone&s;ty,
he is a Knave, and every Thing that is ba&s;e and
bad. But</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Promi&s;es ought to be understood both
by the Per&s;on to whom, and the Per&s;on by whom,
<PB N="65" REF="81">
they are made as liable to tho&s;e Contingencies
that all human Affairs and Per&s;ons are liable to,
as Death, Accidents, Di&s;appointments, and Di&s;|order:
Thus, if a Man, who ought to pay me
to Day, tells me, Sir, I cannot comply with you
to Day, but if you call for it next Week, you &s;hall
have it.</P>
<P>If I may put this An&s;wer into plainer <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and
I &s;uppo&s;e the Man to be an hone&s;t Man; I cannot
under&s;tand his Meaning otherwi&s;e than thus:</P>
<P>&startq;Sir, I acknowledge your Money is due;
I have not Ca&s;h enough by me to pay you to
Day; but I have &s;everal running Bills, and &s;e|veral
Per&s;ons who have promi&s;ed me Money,
which I doubt not I &s;hall receive again&s;t &s;uch a
Time; and if you call then, I make no Que|&s;tion,
but I &s;hall be able to do it; and if it is
po&s;&s;ible for me to pay you, I will do it at that
Time, without Fail.&endq;</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, it were as well to expre&s;s them&s;elves
thus at large, in all the Appointments People make
for Payment; and would the Per&s;ons who make
them con&s;ider it, they would do &s;o: But Cu&s;tom
has prevail'd in our general Way of Speaking,
whereby all Things that are &s;ubject to the com|mon
known Contingents of Life, or vi&s;ible in the
Circum&s;tances of the Ca&s;e, are understood without
being expre&s;&s;ed. For Example:</P>
<P>I make an Appointment of meeting a Man po|&s;itively
at &s;uch a Town, &s;uch a certain Day or
Hour; if I were talking to a <HI>Turk</HI> or a <HI>Pagan</HI> that
knows nothing, or believes nothing, of Supreme
Providence; I would &s;ay, <HI>If the Lord of Heaven
and Earth that governs all my Actions, plea&s;e to pre|&s;erve
and permit me:</HI> But when I am talking to as
<HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> it &s;hould &s;eem to be &s;o univer&s;ally &s;up|po&s;ed,
that every Appointment is &s;ubjected, and
<PB N="66" REF="82">
&s;ubmits to the Government of Providence, that the
Repetition would be needle&s;s; and that when a
Man promi&s;es positively to meet, 'tis with a general
<HI>Subintelligitur,</HI> a Re&s;erve as natural as Nature it
&s;elf, to the Divine Permi&s;&s;ion: All Men know, that
unle&s;s I am alive, I cannot come there; or, if I
am taken &s;ick, both which may ea&s;ily happen,
I &s;hall di&s;appoint him: And therefore, if he &s;hou'd
urge me again to come without Fail, and I &s;hould
rep$y, I won't fail, if I am alive and well, the
Man ought to take it for an Affront, and ask me,
if I take him for a Fool, to think, if I am taken
&s;ick, I &s;hould come with my Bed at my Back; or
if Death &s;hould interveen, he had Occa&s;ion to
&s;peak with my Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>In this Sen&s;e, a Trade&s;man who promises Pay|ment
of Money at a &s;et Time; fir&s;t 'tis &s;uppo|&s;ed
he has it not now in his Hands, becau&s;e he
puts off the Per&s;on demanding to a further Day,
and promi&s;es to comply with it then: This Pro|mi&s;e
therefore, can be under&s;tood no otherwi&s;e,
than that he expects to receive Money by that
Time: Now, if this Man, by the like Di&s;ap|pointments
from other Men, or any other invo|luntary
Ca&s;ualty, is really and <HI>bona fide</HI> unable
to comply with the Time of promi&s;ed Payment;
I cannot &s;ee, but this may befal an hone&s;t Man,
and he neither de&s;igning to fail when he promi|&s;ed,
nor being able to prevent the Accident that
oblig'd him to do it, nor any way voluntary in the
Breach, is not in my Opinion guilty of a Lie, or
Breach of his Honour, tho' he did not make
tho&s;e verbal Re&s;erves in the Promi&s;es he had
given.</P>
<P>If every Man, who cannot comply with pro|mi&s;ed
Payments, &s;hould be thus branded with
Lying and Di&s;hone&s;ty, then let him, who is
<PB N="67" REF="83">
without the Sin, ca&s;t the Stone, for no body
el&s;e ought to do it.</P>
<P>'Tis true, there is a Difference between an
Accident, and a Practice; that is in &s;hort, there
is a Difference between him who meets with a
great many Occa&s;ions thus to break his Word,
and he that meets with but a few: But if it be
a Crime, he that commits it once, is no more an
hone&s;t Man, than he that commits it forty Times;
and if it be not a Crime, he that does it forty
Times, is as hone&s;t as he that has Occa&s;ion to do
it but once.</P>
<P>But let no Man take Encouragement from hence,
to be prodigal of his Word, and &s;lack in his Per|formance;
for this nice Path is &s;o near the Edge
of the Pit of Knavery, that the lea&s;t Slip lets you
fall in.</P>
<P>The&s;e Promi&s;es mu&s;t have Abundance of Cir|cum&s;tances
to bring the hone&s;t Man out of the
Scandal.</P>
<P>As, 1&s;t. The Di&s;appointments which occasioned
this Breach of his Word, mu&s;t have been un|fore&s;een,
and unexpected, otherwi&s;e the Ex|pectation
of performing his Promi&s;e, was ill
grounded, and then his Hone&s;ty is an&s;we|rable
for the very making the Promi&s;e, as
well as the breaking it.</P>
<P>2d. No Endeavours mu&s;t be wanting to com|ply
with the Promi&s;e; otherwi&s;e 'tis wrong
to &s;ay, I am di&s;appointed, and can't make
good my Word; the Man ought to &s;ay, Sir,
I have di&s;appointed my &s;elf by my Negli|gence
or Wilfulne&s;s, and have obliged my
&s;elf to break my Word; or, in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> Sir, I
am a Knave; for tho' I made you a Promi&s;e
which I might have performed, I took no
<PB N="68" REF="84">
Care about it, not valuing the Forfeiture of
my Word.</P>
<P>If then the Ca&s;e is &s;o nice, tho' in the Strict|ne&s;s
of Speaking, &s;uch a Disappointment may
oblige an hone&s;t Man to break his Word; yet
every hone&s;t Man, who would pre&s;erve that Cha|racter
to him&s;elf, ought to be the more wary, and
indu&s;triou&s;ly avoid: making &s;uch ab&s;olute uncon|ditional
Promi&s;es, becau&s;e we are to avoid the
Circum&s;tances of Offence.</P>
<P>But as to the Nature of the Thing, 'tis plain to
me, that a Man may in &s;uch Ca&s;es be obliged to
break his Word unwillingly, and nothing can be
a Fraud or di&s;hone&s;t Action in that Ca&s;e, which is
not either voluntary in it &s;elf, or the Occa&s;ion
voluntarily procur'd.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Of Relative HONESTY.</HEAD>
<P>_AS Hone&s;ty is &s;imple and plain, with|out
Glo&s;s and Pretence, &s;o 'tis univer|&s;al:
He that may uphold an untainted
Reputation in one Particular, may be
ju&s;tly branded with Infamy in another. A Man
may be punctual in his Dealings, and a Knave
in his Relations; hone&s;t in his Ware-hou&s;e, and
a Knave at his Fire-&s;ide: He may be a Saint in
his Company, a Devil in his Family; true to his
Word, and fal&s;e to his Friend&s;hip: But who&s;oe|ver
he be, he is no hone&s;t Man. An hone&s;t
Man is all of a Piece, the whole Contexture of
his Life, his general Conduct is genuine, and
&s;quar'd according to the Rules of Hone&s;ty; he
never runs into Extremes and Exce&s;&s;es on one
Hand or other.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="85">
I confe&s;s, I find 'this Thing, which they call
<HI>Relative Hone&s;ty,</HI> very little, thought of in the
World; and that which is &s;till wor&s;e, 'tis very lit|tle
understood: I'll bring it down to but a few
Examples; &s;ome of which frequently happen a|mong
us, and will therefore be the more familiar|ly
receiv'd.</P>
<P>There are relative Obligations entail'd on us
in our Family Circum&s;tances, which are ju&s;t
Debts, and mu&s;t be paid; and which, in a Word,
a Man can no more be hone&s;t, if he does not make
Con&s;cience of Di&s;charging, than he can in the
Ca&s;e of the mo&s;t unque&s;tionable Debts between
Man and Man.</P>
<P>The Debts from Children to Parents, and from
Wives to their Husbands, are in a Manner re|latively
chang'd, and the Obligation transferr'd
into the Order of religious Duties. God the
Guide and Commander of all Subordination, has
as it were, taken that Part into his own Hand;
'tis rather call'd a Duty to him, than a relative
Duty only: But if Men take this for a Di&s;charge
to them, of all relative Obligations to Wives and
to Children, or that God had le&s;s required one
than the other, they mu&s;t act upon very wrong
Principles.</P>
<P>Nature indeed dictates in general a Man's
providing Sub&s;i&s;tence for his Family, and he is
declared to be &s;o far from a Chri&s;tian, that he is
wor&s;e than an Infidel that neglects it: But there
are other Parts of our Obligations, which Ho|ne&s;ty
calls upon us to perform.</P>
<P>A Wife and Children are Creditors to the Fa|ther
or the Family; and he cannot be an hone&s;t
Man that does not di&s;charge his Debt to them,
any more than he could, if he did not repay Mo|ney
borrowed, to a Stranger and not to lead my
<PB N="70" REF="86">
Reader on to intricate and di&s;puted Particulars;
I in&s;tance principally in tho&s;e that no body can
di&s;pute: As <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> EDUCATION: By this
I mean, not only putting Children to School,
which &s;ome Parents think, is all they have to do
with or for their Children; and indeed with &s;ome,
is all that they know how to do, or are fit to do:
I &s;ay, I do not mean this only, but &s;everal other
additional Cares, as (1.) Directing what School,
what Parts of Learning, is proper for them, what
Improvements they are to be taught. (2.) Study|ing
the Genius and Capacities of their Children,
in what they teach them: Some Children will vo|luntarily
learn one Thing, and can never be forc'd
to learn another's and for Want of which ob&s;erving
the Genius of Children, we have &s;o many learned
Blockheads in the World, who are mere Scholars,
Pedants, and no more. (3.) But the main Part of
this Debt, which Relative Hone&s;ty calls upon us
to pay to our Children, is the Debt of In&s;truction,
the Debt of Government, the Debt of Example:
He that neglects to pay any of the&s;e to his Fami|ly,
is a <HI>relative Knave;</HI> let him value him&s;elf
upon his Hone&s;ty, in paying his other Debts,
as much as he will.</P>
<P>'Tis a &s;trange Notion Men have of Hone&s;ty,
and of their being hone&s;t Men, as if it related to no|thing
but Trade&s;men, or Men who borrow and
lend; or that the Title was obtain'd by an ordi|nary
Ob&s;ervance of Right and Wrong between
Man and Man. 'Tis a great Mi&s;take, the Name
of an hone&s;t Man is neither &s;o ea&s;ily gain'd, or &s;o
&s;oon lo&s;t, as the&s;e Men imagine. <HI>David</HI> was a
very hone&s;t Man, notwith&s;tanding his Pa&s;&s;ion and
Revenge in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Nabal,</HI> his Murther in the
Ca&s;e of <HI>U$iah,</HI> or his Ad$l$ery in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Bath|&s;heba.</HI>
The Intent and main De&s;ign of his Life
<PB N="71" REF="87">
was upright; and whenever he fell by the Power
of that Temptation that overcame him, he ro&s;e
again by Repentance.</P>
<P>Let no vain Men flatter them&s;elves with the
Pride of their Hone&s;ty, in mere Matters of Debtor
and Creditor, tho' that's al&s;o absolutely nece&s;&s;ary
and e&s;&s;ential to an hone&s;t Man.</P>
<P>But trace this hone&s;t Man home to his Family:
Is he a Tyrant or a Churl to his Wife? Is he a
Stranger to the Conduct and Behaviour of his
Children? Is he an <HI>Eli</HI> to their Vices? Are they
I unin&s;tructed, uncorrected, unexhorted ungover|ned,
or ill governed? That Man's <HI>a Knave,</HI> a re|lative
Knave; he neither does his Duty to God,
or pays the Debt of a Husband, or of a Parent to
His Wife or his Family.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> After the Debt of EDUCATION,
there is the Debt of INDUCTION due
from us to our Children. The Debt from a Pa|rent
is far from ending when the Children come
from School, as the Brutes who turn their Young
off from them when they are ju&s;t able to pick for
them&s;elves: It is our Bu&s;ine&s;s, doubtle&s;s, to introduce
them into the World, and to do it in &s;uch a manner,
as &s;uits the Circum&s;tances we are in, as to their
Supply, and the Inclinations and Capacities of
our Children: This is a Debt, the Want of pay|ing
which, makes many Children too ju&s;tly re|proach
their Parents with neglecting them in their
Youth, and not giving them the nece&s;&s;ary Intro|duction
into the World, as might have qualify'd
them to &s;truggle and &s;hift for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Not to do this, is to ruine our Children nega|tively
on one Hand, as doing it without Judgment,
and without Regard to our Family Circum&s;tan|ces,
and our Childrens Capacities, is a po&s;itive
ruining them on the other. I could very u&s;efully
<PB N="72" REF="88">
run out this Part into a long Di&s;cour&s;e on the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
there is of con&s;ulting the Inclinations and
Capacities of our Children, in our placing them
out in the World. How many a martial Spirit do
we find damn'd to Trade, while we &s;poil many a
good Porter, and convert the able Limbs and
Bones of a Blockhead into the Figure of a long
Robe, or a Gown and Ca&s;&s;ock?</P>
<P>How many awkward clum&s;y Fellows do we
breed to Surgery, or to Mu&s;ick, who&s;e Fingers
and Joints, Nature originally de&s;ign'd, and plain|ly
&s;hew'd it us by their Size, were better &s;uited
for the Black&s;mith's Sledge, or the Carpenter's
Axe, the Waterman's Oar, or the Carman's
Whip?</P>
<P>Whence comes it to pa&s;s, that we have &s;o many
young Men brought to the Bar, and to the Pul|pit,
with &s;tammering Tongues; He&s;itations, and
Impediments in their Speech, unmu&s;ical Voices,
and no common Utterance; while on the other
Hand, Nature's Cripples, Bow-legg'd, Battle|ham'd,
and half-made Creatures, are bred Tum|blers
and Dancing-Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>I name the&s;e, becau&s;e they occur mo&s;t in our
common Ob&s;ervation, and are all mi&s;erable Ex|amples,
where the Children cur&s;e the Knavery of
their Fathers, in not paying the Debt they ow'd
to them as Parents, in putting them to Employ|ments
that had been &s;uitable to their Capacities,
and &s;uitable to what Nature had cut them out for.</P>
<P>I came into a publick Hou&s;e once in <HI>London,</HI>
where there was a black <HI>Maletta</HI>-look'd Man &s;it|ting,
talking very warmly among &s;ome Gentle|men,
who I ob&s;erv'd were li&s;tening very attentive|ly
to what he &s;aid; and I &s;at my&s;elf down, and
did the like; 'twas with great Plea&s;ure I heard him
di&s;cour&s;e very hand&s;omly on &s;everal weighty Sub|jects;
<PB N="73" REF="89">
I found he was a very good Scholar,
had been very hand&s;omely bred, and that Lear|ning
and Study was his Delight; and more than
that, &s;ome of the be&s;t of Science was at that Time
his Employment: At length I took the Freedom
to ask him, If he was born in <HI>England?</HI></P>
<P>He reply'd with a great deal of good Humour
in the Manner, but with an Exce&s;s of Re&s;entment
at his Father, and with Tears in his Eyes, Yes,
yes, Sir, I am a true-born <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, to my
Father's Shame be it &s;poken; who being an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Man him&s;elf, could find in his Heart to join him|&s;elf
to a <HI>Negro</HI> Woman, tho' he mu&s;t needs know,
the Children he &s;hould beget, would cur&s;e the Me|mory
of &s;uch an Action, and abhor his very Name
for the &s;ake of it. Yes, yes, &s;ays he, repeating
it again, I am an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man, and born in law|ful
Wedlock; happy had it been for me, tho' my
Father had gone to the Devil for Whoredom,
had he lain with a Cook-Maid, or produced
me from the meane&s;t Beggar Woman in the Street.
My Father might do the Duty of Nature to his
black Wi&s;e; but, God knows, he did no Ju&s;tice
to his Children. If it had not been for this
damn'd black Face of mine, &s;ays he then &s;miling,
I had been bred to the Law, or brought up in the
Study of Divinity: But my Father gave me Lear|ning
to no manner of Purpo&s;e; for he knew I &s;hould
never be able to ri&s;e by it to any Thing, but a
learned <HI>Valet de Chamber.</HI> What he put me to
School for, I cannot imagine: He &s;poil'd a good
Tarpawlin, when he &s;trove to make me a Gentle|man:
When he had re&s;olv'd to marry a Slave, and
lye with a Slave, he &s;hould have begot Slaves,
and let us have been bred as we were born: But he
has twice ruin'd me; fir&s;t with getting me a fright|ful
<PB N="74" REF="90">
Face, and $hen going to paint a Gentleman
upon me.</P>
<P>It was a mo&s;t affecting Di&s;cour&s;e indeed, and as
&s;uch I record it; and I found it ended in Tears,
from the Per&s;on who was in him&s;elf the mo&s;t de|&s;erving,
mode&s;t, and judicious Man, that I ever
met with, under a <HI>Negro</HI> Countenance in my Life.</P>
<P>After this Story, I per&s;waded my&s;elf I need &s;ay
no more to this Ca&s;e; the Education of our Chil|dren,
their In&s;truction, and the Introducing them
into the World, is a Part of Hone&s;ty, a Debt we
owe to them; and he cannot be an hone&s;t Man
that does not to the utmo&s;t of his Ability and
Judgment, endeavour to pay it.</P>
<P>All the other relative Obligations, which Fa|mily
Circum&s;tances call for the Di&s;charge of, al|low
the &s;ame Method of arguing for, and are
Debts in their Proportion, and mu&s;t be paid upon
the &s;ame Principle of Integrity. I have neither
room, nor is there any Occa&s;ion to enlarge upon
them.</P>

one el&s;e.</P>
<P>This is the truly agreeable Per&s;on, and the on|ly
one that can be call'd &s;o in the World; his Com|pany
is a Charm, and is rather wonder'd at than
imitated: 'Tis almo&s;t a Vertue to envy &s;uch a
Man; and one is apt innocently to grieve at him,
when we &s;ee what is &s;o de&s;irable in him, and can|not
either find it, or make it in our &s;elves.</P>
<P>But take this with you in the Character of this
happy Man, namely, that he is always a good
Man, a religious Man: 'Tis a gro&s;s Error to ima|gine,
that a Soul blacken'd with Vice, loaded with
Crime, degenerated into Immorality and Folly,
<PB N="77" REF="93">
can be that Man, can have this calm, &s;erene Soul,
tho&s;e clear Thoughts, tho&s;e con&s;tant Smiles upon
his Brow, and the &s;teady Agreeablene&s;s and Plea|&s;antry
in his Temper, that I am &s;peaking of; there
mu&s;t be Intervals of Darkne&s;s upon &s;uch a Mind;
Storms in the Con&s;cience will always lodge Clouds
upon the Countenance; and where the Weather
is hazey within, it can never be Sun-&s;hine without;
the Smiles of a di&s;turb'd Mind are all but feign'd
and forg'd; there may be a good Di&s;po&s;ition, but
it will be too often and too evidently interrupted
by the Recoils of the Mind, to leave the Tem|per
untouch'd, and the Humour free and uncon|cern'd;
when the Drum beats an Alarm within
it is impo&s;&s;ible but the Di&s;turbance will be di&s;|cover'd
without.</P>
<P>Mark the Man of Crime; &s;it clo&s;e to him in
Company, at the End of the mo&s;t exube|rant
Excur&s;ion of his Mirth, you will never
fail, to hear his reflecting Faculty whi&s;per a
Sigh to him; he'll &s;hake it off, you will &s;ee him
check it and go on; perhaps he &s;ings it off, but
at the End of every Song, nay perhaps of every
Stanza, it returns; a kind of involuntary Sadne&s;s
breaks upon all his Joy; he perceives it, rouzes,
de&s;pi&s;es it, and goes on; but in the Middle of a
long Laugh, in drops a Sigh; it will be, it can
be no otherwi&s;e; and I never convers'd clo&s;ely
with a Man of Levity in my Life, but I could
perceive it mo&s;t plainly; 'tis a Kind of Re&s;pira|tion,
natural to a &s;ti&s;l'd Conviction; a He&s;itation
that is the Con&s;quence of a captivated Vertue:
a little In&s;urrection in the Soul again&s;t the Tyran|ny
of profligate Principles.</P>
<P>But in the good Man the Calm is compleat;
'tis all Nature, no Counter$eit; he is always in
Humour, becau&s;e he is always compos'd.</P>
<Q><PB N="78" REF="94">
He's calm without, becau&s;e he's clear within.</Q>
<P>A &s;tated Compo&s;ure of Mind can really pro|ceed

this is the Rea&s;on why 'tis my Opinion, that the

in his Chain, and is as contented as any Man
living: The Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or Power, which that Va|pour
or Delirium has upon his Brain, makes him
fancy him&s;elf a Prince, a Monarch, a State&s;man,
or ju&s;t what he plea&s;es to be; as a certain Dut|che&s;s,

Maje&s;ty, Imperial Maje&s;ty, and the like and
with this Splendor, her di&s;temper'd Mind is
deluded, forming Ideas of Things which are
not, and at the &s;ame Time her Eyes are &s;hut to
the eternal Captivity of her Circum&s;tances; in
which &s;he is made a Property to other Per&s;ons, her

demented Creature to the la&s;t Degree, an Ob|ject
of human Compa&s;&s;ion, and compleatly mi|&s;erable.</P>
<P>The only Contentment which entitles Mankind
to any Felicity, is that which is founded upon
Vertue and ju&s;t Principles; for Contentment is
nothing more or le&s;s than what we call Peace;
and what Peace, where Crime po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Mind,
<PB N="79" REF="95">
which is attended, as a natural Con&s;equence, with
Torment and Di&s;quiet? What Peace where the

But I return to the Subject of Conver&s;ation, from
which this Digre&s;&s;ion is made only to &s;hew that
the Fund of agreeable Conver&s;ation is, and can
only be founded in Virtue; this alone is the Thing
that keeps a Man always in Humour, and always
agreeable.</P>
<P>They mi&s;take much, who think Religion; or a
&s;trict Morality, di&s;compo&s;es the Temper, &s;owres
the Mind, and unfits a Man for Conver&s;ation.
'Tis irrational to think, a Man can't be bright,
unle&s;s he is wicked; It may as well be &s;aid, a
Man cannot be merry till he is mad; not agree|able
till he is offen&s;ive, not in Humour till he is out
of him&s;elf. 'Tis clear to me, no Man can be truly
merry, but he that is truly virtuous: Wit is as
con&s;i&s;tent with Religion, as Religion is with good
Manners; nor is there any Thing, in the Limita|tions
of Virtue and Religion; I mean, the ju&s;t
Re&s;traints which Religion and Virtue lay upon us
in Conver&s;ation; that &s;hould abate the Plea&s;ure of
it, on the contrary they encrea&s;e it; <HI>For Example:</HI>
Re&s;traints from vicious and indecent Di&s;cour&s;es$
There's as little Manners in tho&s;e Things, as
there is Mirth in them; nor indeed does Re|ligion
or Virtue rob Conver&s;ation of one Grain
of true Mirth: On the contrary, the religious
Man is the only Man fully qualify'd for Mirth
and good Humour; with this Advantage, that
when the vitious and the virtuous Man appear gay
and merry, but differ, <HI>as they mu&s;t do,</HI> in the Subject
of their Mirth, you may always ob&s;erve the virtu|ous
Man's Mirth is &s;uperiour to the other; more
&s;uitable to him, as a Man, as a Gentleman, as a
wi&s;e Man, and as a good Man; and generally
&s;peaking, the other will acknowledge it; at lea&s;t,
afterward, when his Thoughts cool, and as his
Reflections come in.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="98">
But what &s;hall we do to correct the Vices of
Conver&s;ation? How &s;hall we &s;hew Men the Pi|cture
of their own Behaviour? There is not a
greater Undertaking in the World, or an Attempt
of more Con&s;equence to the Good of Mankind
than this; but 'tis as difficult al&s;o, as it is use|ful;
and at be&s;t I &s;hall make but a little Progre&s;s
in it in this Work; <HI>let others mend it.</HI></P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Of unfitting our &s;elves for CONVER|SATION.</HEAD>
<P>_BEfore I enter upon the Thing which I
call the Immorality of Conver&s;ation,
let me &s;ay a little about the many weak
and fooli&s;h Ways, by which Men &s;trive,
as it were, to unfit them&s;elves for Conver&s;ation.
Human Infirmities furni&s;h us with &s;everal Things
that help to make us unconver&s;ible; we need not
&s;tudy to encrea&s;e the Di&s;advantages we lye under
on that Score: Vice and Intemperance, <HI>not as a
Crime only, that I &s;hould &s;peak of by it&s;elf,</HI> but even
as a Di&s;temper, unfit us for Conver&s;ation; they
help to make us cynical, moro&s;e, &s;urly, and rude.
Vicious People boa&s;t of their polite Carriage and
their nice Behaviour, how gay, how good hu|mour'd,
how agreeable? for a While it may be &s;o:
But trace them as Men of Vice, follow them till
they come to Years, and ob&s;erve, while you live,
you never &s;ee the Humour la&s;t, but they grow fie|ry,
moro&s;e, po&s;itive, and petulant. An ancient
Drunkard is a Thing indeed not often &s;een; be|cau&s;e
the Vice has one good Faculty with it, <HI>viz.</HI>
That in &s;eldom hands them, on to <HI>old Age;</HI> But
an ancient <HI>and good humour'd Drunkard,</HI> I think I
never knew.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="99">
It &s;eems &s;trange, that Men &s;hould affect unfit|ting
them&s;elves for Society, and &s;tudy to make
them&s;elves unconver&s;ible, whereas their being
truly Sociable, as Men, is the Thing which
would mo&s;t recommend them, and that to the
be&s;t of Men, and be&s;t an&s;wers to the highe&s;t Fe|licity
of Life. Let no Man value him&s;elf upon
being moro&s;e and cynical, &s;our and unconver&s;ible,
'tis the Rever&s;e of a good Man; a truly religi|ous
Man follows the Rule of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>be Af|fable,
be Courteous, be Humble; in Meekne&s;s, e&s;teeming
every Man better than our &s;elves;</HI> whereas Conver&s;a|tion
now is the Rever&s;e of the Chri&s;tian Rule;
'tis interrupted with Conceitedne&s;s and Affectati|on,
<HI>a Pride, e&s;teeming our &s;elves better than every
Man;</HI> and that which is wor&s;e &s;till, this happens
generally, when indeed the Ju&s;tice of the Ca&s;e is
again&s;t us; for where is the Man who thus over|ruling
him&s;elf, is not evidently inferiour in Merit
to all about him? Nay, and frequently tho&s;e
who put mo&s;t Value upon them&s;elves, have the
lea&s;t Merit to &s;upport it. <HI>Self-Conceit</HI> is the
Bane of human Society, and generally &s;peaking
is the Peculiar of tho&s;e who have the lea&s;t to
recommend them; 'tis the Ruin of Conver&s;ation,
and the De&s;truction of all Improvement; for how
&s;hould any Man receive any Advantage from the
Conver&s;ation of others, who believes him&s;elf qua|lified
to teach them, and not to have Occa&s;ion to
learn any Thing from them?</P>
<P>Nay, as the Fool is generally the Man that is
conceited mo&s;t of his own Wit, &s;o that very
Conceit is the Ruin of him; it confirms him a
Fool all the Days of his Life, for he that thinks
him&s;elf a wi&s;e Man, is a Fool, and knows it
not; nay, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, he &s;hould continue to be
<PB N="84" REF="100">
a Fool, if he was but once convinc'd of his,
Folly.</P>
<Q><L>If Fools could their own Ignorance di&s;cern,</L>
<L>They'd be no longer Fools, <HI>becau&s;e they'd learn.</HI></L></Q>
<P>It will be objected here indeed, that Folly and
Conceit may be hurtful to Conver&s;ation, may
rob Men of the Advantage of it, unfit one Side
for Conver&s;ing, and make it unprofitable, as well
as unplea&s;ant to the other; But that this is no|thing
to the Immorality of Conver&s;ation; that Ig|norance
and Conceit may be an Infirmity, but is
not always a Crime; that the Mi&s;chief of
Mens being Fools as generally their own, but
the Mi&s;chief of their being Knaves is to other
People, and this is very true. But certainly, e$|gregious
Folly merits one Paragraph of Rebuke;
perhaps it may touch the Sen&s;es of &s;ome weak
Brethren one time or other, and the Labour may
not be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw a more &s;imple, or yet a more fu|rious
irreconcileable Quarrel, than once between
two of the mo&s;t empty conceited People that e|ver
I knew in the World; and it was upon one
calling the other <HI>Fool,</HI> which on both Sides was
unhappily very true; they fought upon the Spot,
but were parted by the Company; they chal|lenged,
and could not meet, their Friends getting
Notice of it; in &s;hort, it ruin'd them both; they
made new Appointments, and at la&s;t deceiv'd their
Friends, and fought again; they were both woun|ded,
and one died, the other fled the Country,
and never return'd. The fir&s;t own'd he was a
Fool; which was indeed &s;ome Diminution of his
Folly. I &s;ay, he knew him&s;elf to be a Fool, but
could not bear the other &s;hould tell him &s;o, who
<PB N="85" REF="101">
was more a Fool than him&s;elf. The other boldly a&s;|&s;erted
his own Capacities to be infinitely greater
than they were, and de&s;pi&s;ed the fir&s;t to the la&s;t
Degree, who indeed, if he had not more Wit,
had more Mode&s;ty than the other; but both like
Fools fought about <HI>Nothing,</HI> for &s;uch indeed the
Que&s;tion about their Wit might very well have
been call'd.</P>
<P>But, it is true, after all, the Want of a con|ver&s;ible
Temper, if from a Want or Defect of
Sen&s;e may be an Infirmity, not an Immorality;
that is to &s;ay, the Cau&s;e is not &s;o in it&s;elf, but
it may be &s;o in its Con&s;equences, that way al&s;o.
<HI>For the Conver&s;ation of Fools is Vanity in the Ab|&s;tract.</HI>
I might here indeed find Subject for a
large Tract, upon the infinite Diver&s;ity of Fools,
and by con&s;equence the wondrous Beauty of their
Conver&s;ation: I have on this Occa&s;ion reckon'd
up a Li&s;t of about Seven and Thirty &s;everal Sorts
of Fools, be&s;ides <HI>Solomon</HI>'s <HI>Fool,</HI> whom I take to be
<HI>the wicked Fool</HI> only; the&s;e I have diver&s;ified by
their Tempers and Humours, and in the infinite
Variety of their Follies of &s;everal Sorts, in every
one of which they rob them&s;elves, and all that
keep them Company of the Felicity of Conver|&s;ation,
there being nothing in them but Empti|ne&s;s,
or a Fulne&s;s of what is Ridiculous, and on|ly
qualified to be laught at, or found Fault
with.</P>
<P>I have likewi&s;e de&s;crib'd &s;ome of their Con|ver&s;ation,
their vain Repetitions, their Catch-Words,
their Laughings and Ge&s;tures, and adap|ted
them to make the World merry. I have
Thoughts of running it on into foreign Chara|cters,
and de&s;cribe <HI>French, Spani&s;h, Portugue&s;e</HI>
Fools, and Fools of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia, China,</HI> and the <HI>Ea&s;t
Indies:</HI> But as this is &s;omething remote from the
<PB N="86" REF="102">
De&s;ign in Hand, which is more &s;erious, and
done on a much better View, and likewi&s;e of
an unmea&s;urable Length, like the weighty Sub|ject
it is upon (<HI>for Folly is a large Field</HI>) &s;o I re|fer
it to another Opportunity.</P>
<P>The Truth is, that Part of Conver&s;ation which
I am now to &s;peak of, or which I mean by what
I have &s;aid upon this Subject, is the weighty and
&s;erious Part, and is not the meer common Talk,
or a Conver&s;ation which Fools are capable of;
'tis exerci&s;ed in a &s;olid and well temper'd Frame,
and when regulated as it ought to be, by Virtue,
and good Morals, is quallified to make Mankind
happy in the Enjoyment of the be&s;t Things,
and of the be&s;t Company, and therefore, the E|vils
that creep into, and corrupt this Part of our
Conver&s;ation, are of the more fatal Quality, and
worth our expo&s;ing, that People may &s;ee and
&s;hun them, and that Conver&s;ation may be re&s;tored

<P>_SOME may object again&s;t the Term
<HI>the Immorality</HI> of Conver&s;ation, and
think the Word improper to the Sub|ject;
but to &s;ave any Critick the dearly
beloved Labour of cavilling in Favour of ill Man|ners

my&s;elf before I go any farther.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="103">
I call Conver&s;ation immoral, where the Di&s;|cour&s;e
is indecent, where 'tis irreligious or pro|fane,
where 'tis immode&s;t or &s;candalous, or where
'tis &s;landerous and abu&s;ive. In the&s;e and &s;uch Ca|&s;es,
<HI>loqui e&s;t agere,</HI> thus talking lewdly, or talking
profanely, is an immode&s;t Action. Such is the
Power of Words that Mankind is able to act, as
much Evil by their Tongues, as by their Hands;
the Ideas that are formed in the Mind from what
we hear, are mo&s;t peircing and permanent; and
the Force of Example in this Ca&s;e, is not more
powerful than the Force of Argument.</P>
<P>Some of the wor&s;t Sins are not to be commit|ted
but by the Tongue, as the Sin of Bla&s;phemy,
&s;peaking Trea&s;on again&s;t the Maje&s;ty of God,
Cur&s;ings and Imprecations among Men, <HI>Lies,
Slanders,</HI> and a va&s;t Variety of petty Excur&s;ions,
which are grown modi&s;h by Cu&s;tom, and &s;eem too
&s;mall to be reproved.</P>
<P>We are here in <HI>England,</HI> after many Years De|generacy,
arrived to a Time, wherein Vice is in
general di&s;countenanc'd by Authority; God in
Mercy to the Age has in&s;pir'd our Government
with a Re&s;olution to di&s;courage it: The King
now, his Wars are over, and his foreign Enemies
allow him &s;ome Re&s;t, will, we hope, declare War
again&s;t this Dome&s;tick Enemy.</P>
<P>The late Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> of heavenly Memory, for
her Piety and ble&s;&s;ed Example, appear'd in her
Time gallantly in the Cau&s;e of Virtue: Magi|&s;trates
were encourag'd to puni&s;h Vice, new
Laws made to re&s;train it, and Ju&s;tice &s;eem'd to
be at Work to reclaim it: But what can Kings, or
Queens, or Parliaments do? Laws and Procla|mations
are weak and u&s;ele&s;s Things, unle&s;s &s;ome
&s;ecret Influence can affect the Practices of tho&s;e
whom no Laws can reach.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="104">
To make Laws again&s;t Words, would be as

<P>Conver&s;ation has received a general Taint, and
the Di&s;ea&s;e is become a Charm; the Way to cure
it, is not by forcible Re&s;traints on Particulars,
but by &s;ome general Influence on the publick Pra|ctice;
when a Di&s;temper becomes plea&s;ant to a
Patient, he is the harder to be cur'd; he has a &s;ort of
Aver&s;ion to the Remedy becau&s;e he has none to

for the Mode, that if it be but the Fa&s;hion
to be Lewd, they will &s;candalize their Honour, de|bauch
their Bodies, and damn their Souls to be
Gentile; if the Beaux talk Bla&s;phemy, the re&s;t will
&s;et up for Athie&s;ts, and deny their Maker, to be
counted witty in the Defence of it; when our

nothing will &s;atisfy them but to criti|ci&s;e

the hypo&s;tatick Union, the rational De&s;cription of

undemon&s;trable Things, are the common Subject of
their fancied affected Capacities.</P>
<P>Hence come Here&s;ies and Delu&s;ions, Men af|fecting
to &s;earch into what is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould

after; as if a thorow impo&s;&s;ibility of their acting
by their Sen&s;e upon Objects beyond its Reach, was
<PB N="89" REF="105">
an Evidence again&s;t their Being. Thus becau&s;e the
Trinity cannot appear to their Rea&s;oning, they
oppo&s;e their Rea&s;oning to its Reality; they will
dive&s;t the Son of God of his Divinity, and of the
hypo&s;tatick Union of the Godhead in the Per&s;on
of Chri&s;t, becau&s;e they cannot di&s;tingui&s;h between
the Actions done by him in his Mediatorial Capa|city,
in Virtue of his Office, and tho&s;e Actions,
which he did in Virtue of his Omnipotence and
Godhead.</P>
<P>This is not an Immorality and Error in Conver|&s;ation
only, or not &s;o much, &s;o as I think it is a Judg|ment
upon it, a Bla&s;t from Heaven upon the Arro|gance
of the Tongue; when proud Men give
them&s;elves a Loo&s;e to talk Bla&s;phemou&s;ly to be
thought witty, their Maker gives them up to
&s;ugge&s;t damnable Errors till they begin to believe
them, and to broach their own wicked Hints, till
they by Cu&s;tom learn to e&s;pou&s;e and defend
them, as Children tell feigned Stories till they be|lieve&punc;
them to be true. If our Town Fopperies
were vi&s;ible only in the little Excur&s;ions of Dre&s;s
and Behaviour, it would be Satisfaction enough
for a wi&s;e Man, either to pity or laugh at them;
but when Wit is &s;et on work, and Invention rack'd
to find out Methods, how they may be more than
&s;uperlatively wicked, when all the Endowments
of the Mind and Helps of Art, with the Accom|pli&s;hments
of Education are rang'd in Battel a|gain&s;t
Heaven, and joyn'd in Confederacy to make
Mankind more wicked, than ever the Devil had
the Impudence to de&s;ire of them; This calls out
aloud for the Help of all the Powers of Govern|ment,
and all the Strength of Wit and Virtue to
detect and expo&s;e it.</P>

a melancholly kind of Genealogy, of this
<PB N="90" REF="106">
horrid Perfection of Vice, which &s;o increa&s;es i$
our Age, I mean as it re&s;pects this Nation, in
which 'tis too ancient indeed to trace it back to its
Original; yet &s;ince its vi&s;ible Increa&s;e has been
within the reach of our own Memory, and 'tis as
I may &s;ay, the adopted Child of our Age, we
may judge of the Extent of its Influence, and may

can judge of the Extent of its Influence, but &s;uch

the Court to the Plough-tail, where you may too
&s;adly &s;ee the Effect of it, in the general debauch|ing
both the Principles and Practice of all Sorts
and Degrees of this Nation: But it will be an
ungrateful Task, 'twould lead me to the Chara|cters

indeed is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s in this Work; and
therefore I throw by &s;ome keen Ob&s;ervations
which I had made upon this Subject, my Bu&s;ine&s;s

the Patterns of their Gods, that the Stories of
the Rapes and Ince&s;t of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> the Lewdne&s;s of
<HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Mars,</HI> and the like, made tho&s;e Crimes

Satyr upon tho&s;e that are pa&s;t, I choo&s;e to give it
another Turn, which our Kings and People too
in Time to come may make good U&s;e of, and I
hope will not be offended at &s;uppo&s;ing that they
will do &s;o.</P>
<P>1. To Kings or Sovereigns in future Reigns;

they have a glorious Advantage put into their
Hands, to Honour their Maker, and advan|tage
their People, to the immortal Glory of
their own Memory, by prompting Virtue and
di&s;couraging Vice by their happy Examples;
by removing the vicious Habits of Conver|&s;ation
from the Court-Modes, and making
Vice unfa&s;hionable as it is un&s;eemly; why
may not the Royal Example go as far to re|form
a Nation, as it has formerly done to
debauch and ruin it? But as this re&s;pects the

<P>2. To the People with more Freedom I apply
it thus; Let pa&s;t Examples be what they will,
the pre&s;ent Reign encourages no Crime, why
then &s;hould our modern Conver&s;ation receive
this Taint? why &s;hould we be Voluntiers in
the Devil's Service? while the Power we are

if we are Guilty, 'tis by meer Choice, the

throw their Mites into this Trea&s;ury, and &s;ome
zealous Reformers may at la&s;t make the Attempt
upon the&s;e Foundations.</P>
<P>1. A &s;trict Execution of the Laws again&s;t Vice;
we have already, and are every Day making very
good Laws to reform the People: But the Benefit of
Laws con&s;i&s;ts in the executive Power, which if not
vigorou&s;ly put forth, Laws become u&s;ele&s;s, and it
were better they were not made at all. I was once
going to have added here a Treati&s;e, entituled, an
E&s;&s;ay upon the In&s;ignificancy of Laws and Acts of
Parliament in <HI>England;</HI> but upon &s;econd Thoughts,
re&s;olving to mingle no Satyr with my &s;erious Ob|&s;ervations,
I omitted this al&s;o. The Deficiency
of our Laws, is chiefly in the Want of Laws
to reform the Law-makers, that the Wheel of exe|cutive
Ju&s;tice might be kept going; Of what
U&s;e el&s;e can Laws be?</P>
<P>(2) An exemplar Behaviour in our Gentry, after
who&s;e Copy the poor People generally write;
not but that I acknowledge it will be harder,
to reform a Nation, than it would to debauch
it; though Virtue &s;hould obtain upon Cu|&s;tom;
and become the Fa&s;hion, becau&s;e Incli|nation
does not &s;tand neuter; but it would be
a great Step to this Reformation, if we could
all joyn to di&s;courage Immorality by Example;
That if a Man will be drunk or lewd, he &s;hall
<HI>as a Thief robs a Hou&s;e,</HI> do it in the Dark, and
be a&s;hamed of it. If the&s;e two Heads were
brought to pa&s;s, I que&s;tion not but Reformation
would come to &s;uch an heighth, that if a poor
Man happened to be drunk, he &s;hould come and
de&s;ire the Con&s;table to &s;et him in the Stocks, for fear
of wor&s;e Puni&s;hment; and if a rich Man
&s;wore an Oath in his Pa&s;&s;ion, he &s;hould &s;end his
Footman to the next Ju&s;tice of the Peace with his
<PB N="94" REF="110">
Fine, and get a Di&s;charge for fear of being in|form'd
again&s;t and expos'd.</P>
<P>In order to the furthering this great Work, it
would be very nece&s;&s;ary, if po&s;&s;ible, to draw the
Picture of our modern Vices, to let Mankind &s;ee
by a true Light what they are doing, and how
ugly a Phyz the Mi&s;tre&s;s they court really appears
with, when Inclination which paints her in diffe|rent
Colours is taken off.</P>
<P>'Twill be impo&s;&s;ible to bring Vice out of Fa|&s;hion,
if we cannot bring Men to an Under&s;tand|ing
of what it really is: But could we prevail up|on
a Man to examine his Vice, to di&s;&s;ect its Parts,
and view the Anatomy of it; to &s;ee how di&s;agree|able
it is to him as a Man, as a Gentleman, or as
a Chri&s;tian; how de&s;picable and contemptible in
its highe&s;t Fruition, how de&s;tructive to his Sen&s;es,
E&s;tate, and Reputation; how di&s;honourable, and how
bea&s;tly, in its publick Appearances, &s;uch a Man
would certainly be out of Love with it, and be
but Mankind once out of love with Vice, the Re|formation
is half brought to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not pretend to invade the Province of
the Learned, nor offer one Argument from Scrip|ture
or Providence; for I am &s;uppo&s;ed to be talk|ing
to Men that doubt or deny them both. Divi|nity
is not my Talent, nor ever like to be my
Profe&s;&s;ion, the Charge of Prie&s;tcraft and School|men
would not lie again&s;t me; be&s;ides, 'tis not
the way of talking that the World reli&s;hes at this
Time; in a Word, talking Scripture is out of
Fa&s;hion: But I mu&s;t crave leave to tell my Rea|der,
that if there were no God or Providence,
Devil or future State, yet they ought not to be
Drunken and Lewd, Pa&s;&s;ionate, Revengeful or
Immoral; 'tis &s;o Unnatural, &s;o Unruly, &s;o Ingen|teel,
&s;o Fooli&s;h and Foppi&s;h, that no wi&s;e Man as
<PB N="95" REF="111">
a Man can ju&s;tify it &s;o much as to his own Rea|&s;on,
or the Memory of his Ance&s;tors. I &s;uppo&s;e
my &s;elf talking to Men that have nothing to do
with God, and de&s;ire he &s;hould have nothing to
do with them; and yet even to &s;uch, a vicious
Conver&s;ation, look'd on without the Gu&s;t of Incli|nation,
would appear too bruti&s;h to be meddled
with, if we will but choo&s;e <HI>like Men,</HI> not to &s;ay
<HI>like Chri&s;tians;</HI> Virtue and Morality is more
agreeable to human Nature, more manly than
Vice and Intemperance; 'tis more &s;uitable to all
the Ends of Life, to the Being of Society, to the
publick Peace of Families, as well as Nations.
Mankind would rather be virtuous than vicious,
if they were to choo&s;e only for their own Ca&s;e and
Convenience; Vice tends to Oppre&s;&s;ion, War
and Confu&s;ion; Virtue is peaceable and hone&s;t;
Vice is a Poi&s;on to Society, no Man is &s;afe if
Men have neither Sobriety or Hone&s;ty; for the
Innocent will be robb'd by the Thief, ravi&s;ht by
the Lewd, and murther'd by the Drunkard.</P>
<P>It might not be a needle&s;s Digre&s;&s;ion if I &s;hould
examine here, whether Whoring and Drunkenne&s;s
be not the two Mother Sins of the Times, the
Spring and Original of all our fa&s;hionable Vices;
I di&s;tingui&s;h this becau&s;e other Sins, as Mudrers,
Thefts, Rapes and the like, are now come &s;o
much in Vogue; we are content the Laws &s;hould
be executed for them, but &s;hould think it very
hard a Man &s;hou'd be hang'd for Whoring, or
tran&s;ported for being Drunk.</P>
<P>I would not have any of our Gentlemen think,
that my laying the Charge of our Debauchery
on the Examples of the Gods, has taken off any
Thing of the Blame from tho&s;e who have indu|&s;triou&s;ly
propogated the &s;preading Evil, among
their Tenants and Neighbours, by their own vi|cious
<PB N="96" REF="112">
Example; and I could turn the whole Ob&s;er|vation
into a Satyr on the Manners of our Gen|tlemen,
and de&s;cribe with what Ea&s;ine&s;s our
Magi&s;trates let fall the Reins of their Authority,
and connive at the Practice of all manner of In|temperance
and Exce&s;s among the People; with
what Eagerne&s;s the poor Country-men are call'd
in to be made drunk upon every Occa&s;ion; with
what Contempt any Per&s;on is look'd upon either
in Town or Country, that either will not be
drunk, or cannot bear an exce&s;&s;ive Quantity of
Wine: How our common Mirth is fill'd with
Songs and Poems, recommending Drunkenne&s;s and
Lewdne&s;s, and rampant Vice rides Riot through
the Nation. But as above I avoid Satyr, I &s;hall
endeavour to treat this foul Subject, in as civil
Terms as the Ca&s;e will bear, and only examine

vulgar Errors of Behaviour which are crept in, and

I have only a few Things to ask of our mo|dern
Athei&s;ts.</P>
<P>1. Whether their more &s;erious Thoughts do
not reflect upon them in the very Act, and give
the Lie to their Arguments. My Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI>
who was arriv'd to an extraordinary Pitch in this
Infernal Learning, acknowledg'd it on his Death
Bed; the Sen&s;e Nature has upon her of the Cer|tainty
of this great Truth, will give &s;ome Con|vul&s;ions
at &s;o horrid an Act.</P>
<Q><L>Nature pays Homage with a trembling Bow,</L>
<L>And Con&s;cious Men but faintly di&s;allow,</L>
<L>The &s;ecret Trepidation racks the Soul,</L>
<L>And while he &s;ays, no God, replies, Thou Fool.</L></Q>
<P>2. I would ask the mo&s;t confident Athei&s;t, what
A&s;&s;urance he has of the Negative, and what a
Ri&s;que he runs if he &s;hould be mi&s;taken? This we
are &s;ure of, if we want Demon&s;tration to prove
the Being of a God, they are much more at a
Lo&s;s for a Demon&s;tration to prove the Negative.
Now no Man can An&s;wer it to his Prudence, to
take the Ri&s;que they run, upon an uncertain &s;uppo|$it$tious
Notion; for if there be &s;uch a Thing as a
$ir&s;t Cau&s;e, which we call God, they have very
$ittle Rea&s;on to expect much from him, who have
$ade it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to affront him by denying
$s Exi&s;tence. Nor have they acted in their De|$$al
like wi&s;e Men, for they have not u&s;ed &s;o $uch
as the Caution of good Manners, but as
<PB N="100" REF="116">
if they were as &s;ure of his Non-entity, as of the
&s;tronge&s;t Demon&s;tration, they have been witty
upon the Thing, and made a je&s;t of the Suppo&s;i|tion,
turn'd all Matters of Faith into Ridicule,
burle&s;qu'd upon Religion it &s;elf, and made Bal|lads
and Songs on the Bible; thus <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> has
lett us a long $ewd Song, beginning thus:

<P>Now, I am not in this Di&s;cour&s;e entring into any
of the Arguments in the&s;e grand Que&s;tions on one
&s;ide or other, that would be to make this Work
a Collection of Polemicks; nor am I Ca&s;ui&s;t enough
for &s;uch a Work; but I am ob&s;erving or remarking
upon the Wickedne&s;s of the treating the&s;e Subjects
with Levity and Ignorance in the common Road
of Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Methinks the&s;e Gentlemen act with more Courage
than Di&s;cretion; for if it &s;hould happen at la&s;t,
that there &s;hould be a God, and that he has the
Power of Rewards and Puni&s;hments in his Hand,
as he mu&s;t have or cea&s;e to be Almighty, they are
but in an ill Ca&s;e.</P>
<Q><L>If it &s;hould &s;o fall out, as who can tell,</L>
<L>But there may be a God, a Heaven, a Hell,</L>
<L>Mankind had be&s;t con&s;ider well for fear,</L>

<P>Nor do they in my Opinion di&s;cover any great
Wit in it; there is if I might pa&s;s for a Judge,
<PB N="101" REF="117">
&s;omething flat, &s;omething that &s;hocks the Fancy,
in all the Satyr upon Religion that ever I &s;aw; as
if the Mu&s;e were not &s;o much an Athei&s;t as the
Poet, but ba$ks the Hint, and could not favour a
bla&s;phemous Flight with &s;o much Freedom and

a Notice that there is a <HI>tacit</HI> Sen&s;e of the Deity,
though they pretend to deny it lodg'd in the Un|der&s;tanding,
that it is not &s;tifled without &s;ome
Difficulty, and &s;truggles hard with the Fancy,
when the Party &s;trive, to be more than ordinary

of Conver&s;ation when it is prophane, &s;o Bla&s;phe|my
is the Extream of Prophanene&s;s; you cannot
come into Company with an Athei&s;t, but you have
it in his common Di&s;cour&s;e; he is always putting
&s;ome Banter or fooli&s;h Pun upon Religion, affront|ing
the invi&s;ible Power, or ridiculing his Maker;
all his Wit runs out into it, as all Di&s;ea&s;es run, into
the Plague in a Time of Infection, and you mu&s;t
have Patience to hear it or quarrel with him.</P>
<P>Below the&s;e we have a Sort of People who will
acknowledge a God, but he mu&s;t be &s;uch a one
as they plea&s;e to make him; a fine well bred good
natur'd Gentleman like Deity, that cannot have
the Heart to damn any of his Creatures to an
Eternal Puni&s;hment, nor could not be &s;o weak as
to let the <HI>Jews</HI> crucify his own Son; the&s;e Men ex|po&s;e
Religion, and all the Doctrines of Repentance,
and Faith in Chri&s;t, with all the Means of a
Chri&s;tian Salvation, as matter of Banter and Ridi|cule.
The Bible they &s;ay is a good Hi&s;tory in
mo&s;t Parts, but the Story of our Saviour they look
upon as a meer Novel, and the Miracles of the
New Te&s;tament as a Legend of Prie&s;tcraft.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="118">
Further, be&s;ides the&s;e we have <HI>Arians</HI> and <HI>So|cinians,</HI>
the Di&s;ciples of an ancient Heretick, who
went out of the Chutch always at the &s;inging
the <HI>Gloria Patri,</HI> that he might be out of the
Noi&s;e, and would &s;it down at the Doxology of
the Prayers, to note his di&s;owning the Godhead of
Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>The&s;e are Iniquities,</HI> as <HI>Job</HI> &s;aid, <HI>&s;hould be puni&s;hed by

which have given &s;uch a Stroke to the Ruin of
the Nation's Morals; for no Method can be &s;o
direct to prepare People for all Sorts of Wicked|ne&s;s,
as to per&s;wade them out of a Belief of any
&s;upreme Power to re&s;train them; make a Man
once cea&s;e to believe a God, and he has nothing
left to limit his Appetite but meer Philo&s;ophy; if
there is no &s;upreme Judicature, he mu&s;t be his
own Judge and his own Law, and will be &s;o; the
Notion of Hell, Devil, and Infernal Spirits are
empty Things, and have nothing of Terror in
them, if the Belief of a Power &s;uperior to them
be obliterated.</P>
<P>But to bring this particular Ca&s;e nearer to the
Point of Conver&s;ation, the Errors of which lie
before me; though we live in an Age where the&s;e
horrid Degrees of Impiety are too much practi&s;ed;
yet we live in a Place where Religion is profe&s;&s;ed,
the Name of God owned and wor&s;hipped, Reli|ligion
and the Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity e&s;ta|bli&s;hed;
and as it is &s;o, it ought as much to be
pre&s;erved by the Civil Power, from the horrid In|va&s;ion
of Athei&s;ts, Dei&s;ts and Hereticks, as the
Publick Peace, ought to be defended again&s;t Free|booters,
Thieves, and Invaders.</P>
<P>'Tis very improbable any Reformation of Man|ners
&s;hould be brought to pa&s;s, if the debauching
the religious Principles of the Nation, goes on
<PB N="103" REF="119">
with an unre&s;train'd Liberty. How incongruous
is it to the Decoration of Government, that a Man
&s;hall be puni&s;hed for Drunkenne&s;s, and &s;et in the
Stocks for Swearing, but &s;hall have Liberty to de|ny
the God of Heaven, and di&s;pute again&s;t the
very Sum and Sub&s;tance of the Chri&s;tian Doctrine,
&s;hall banter the Scripture, and make Ballads of the
Pentateuch, turn all the Principles of Religion,
the Salvation of the Soul, the Death of our Savi|our,
and the Revelation of the Go&s;pel, into Ridi|cule?
And &s;hall we pretend to Reformation of
Manners, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Immoralities, while
&s;uch as this, is the general Mixture of Conver&s;a|tion?
If a Man talk again&s;t the Government, or
&s;peak &s;currilou&s;ly of the King, he is had to the
<HI>Old Bayly,</HI> and from thence to the Pillory, or
Whipping-Po&s;t, and 'tis fit it &s;hould be &s;o: But
he may &s;peak Trea&s;on again&s;t the Maje&s;ty of Hea|ven,
deny the Godhead of his Redeemer, and make
a Je&s;t of the Holy Gho&s;t, and thus affront the
Power we all adore, and yet pa&s;s with Impunity;
perhaps &s;ome in the Company may have Courage
enough to blame him, 2nd vindicate their Reli|gion
with a <HI>Why do ye talk &s;o?</HI> But where is the
Man, or the Magi&s;trate, that ever vindicated the
Honour of his Maker, with a Re&s;entment beco|ming
the Crime? If a Man give the Lie to a
Gentleman in Company, he takes it as an Af|front,
flies into a Pa&s;&s;ion, quarrels, fights, and
perhaps murders him; nay, &s;ome have done it for
an ab&s;ent Friend, whom they have heard abu&s;ed:
But where is the Gentleman that ever thought
him&s;elf &s;o much concern'd in the Quarrel of his
Maker, but that he could hear him affronted,
his Being deny'd, the Lie given to h$s divine Au|thority,
nay, to his divine Being, and all his
Commands ridicul'd and expos'd, without any
<PB N="104" REF="120">
Motion of Spirit to puni&s;h the In&s;olence of the
Party, and without drawing his Sword in the
Quarrrel, or letting him know he does not like it.</P>
<P>Methinks, I need not make an Apology for
this, as if I meant, that Quarrelling and Fighting
were a proper Practice in the Ca&s;e; the Law does
not admit it in any Ca&s;e; nor is it rea&s;onable it
&s;hould, and God Almighty is far from de&s;iring
us to run any Ri&s;que in his Service: But I chu&s;e
to bring the Ca&s;es into a Parallel, to &s;ignify, that
I think 'tis a vulgar Error in our Behaviour, not
to &s;how our Re&s;entment, when we hear the Ho|nour
and E&s;&s;ence of God &s;lighted and denied, his
Maje&s;ty abu&s;ed, and Religion banter'd and ridi|cul'd
in common Di&s;cour&s;es. I think it would
be very rea&s;onable, to tell a Gentleman he wants
Manners, when he talks reproachfully of his Ma|ker,
and to u&s;e him &s;curvily if he re&s;ented it. It
would very well become a Man of Quality to
cane a lew'd Fop, or kick him down Stairs, when
his In&s;olence took a Loo&s;e at Religion in his Com|pany,
el&s;e Men may be bullied out of their Chri|&s;tianity,
and lampoon'd into Prophanene&s;s, for
Fear of being counted Fools.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, 'tis in in this as in all other like Ca&s;es;
he that will talk athei&s;tically in my Company, ei|ther
believes me to be an Athei&s;t like him&s;elf, or
ventures to impo&s;e upon me; and by impo&s;ing
upon me, either accounts me a Fool that can't
tell when I am put upon, or a Coward that dare
not re&s;ent it.</P>
<P>Upon which Account, even in good Manners,
it ought to be avoided; for it can't be intro|duc'd
into any Part of Conver&s;ation, where the

<HEAD>4. Of Lewd and Immode&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e,</HEAD>
<P>_TAlking Bawdy, that Sodomy of the
Tongue has the mo&s;t of ill Manners, and
the lea&s;t of a Gentleman in it, of any
Part of common Di&s;cour&s;e. Sir <HI>George
Mackenzie</HI> has very hand&s;omely expos'd it in its
proper Colours: But it may not be an Intrench|ment
at all upon his Province, to &s;ay &s;omething
to it in the&s;e Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>This Part is the puculiar Practice of &s;uch Per&s;on
as are hardened to a Degree beyond other Men;
Proficients in Debauchery, who&s;e Lives are &s;o con|tinually
devoted to Lewdne&s;s, that their Mouths
cannot contain it; who can govern their Tongues
no better than their Tails, and are willing to be
thought what really they are. In the&s;e, it is
neither &s;o &s;trange, nor &s;o much a Crime as in o|thers;
the&s;e are Per&s;ons not to be reclaim'd. This
Part of my Ob&s;ervation is not $e&s;igned for their
U&s;e; they are not to be talk'd out of their Vice;
they mu&s;t go on and run their Length: Nothing
but a Goal or an Ho&s;pital ever brings them to a
Reformation; they repent &s;ometimes in that Em|blem
of Hell, a fluxing Hou&s;e, and under the Sur|geons
Hands, wi&s;h a little they had been wi&s;er;
but they follow one Sin with another, till their
Carca&s;s &s;tinks as bad as their Di&s;cour&s;e, and the
Body becomes too na&s;ty, for the Soul to &s;tay any
longer in it: From the&s;e no Di&s;cour&s;e is to be ex|pected,
but what is agreeable to the Tenor of
their Lives; for them to talk otherwi&s;e, would be
&s;train'd and excentrick, and become them as lit|tle,
<PB N="106" REF="122">
as it would be tedious to them; but for a
Gentleman, a Man of &s;eeming Mode&s;ty, and a
Man of Behaviour, not arriv'd to that Cla&s;s in
the Devil's School, for &s;uch a one to mix his Di&s;|cour&s;e
with lew'd and filthy Expre&s;&s;ions, has
&s;omething in it of a Figure, which inrends more
than is expre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>Either we mu&s;t believe &s;uch a one to be very
lew'd in his Practice; or el&s;e, that not being
able yet to arrive to &s;uch a Degree of Wickedne&s;s
as he de&s;ires, he would &s;upply that Defect with a
Cheat, and per&s;wade you to believe he is really
wor&s;e than he is.</P>
<P>Which of the&s;e two Characters I would chu&s;e to
wear, I cannot tell; for he that de&s;ires to be wor&s;e
than he thinks he is, is certainly as bad as he de|&s;ires
to be; and he that is &s;o bad as to let fly the
Excre&s;cencies of it at his Mouth, is as wicked
as the Devil can in Rea&s;on de&s;ire of him.</P>
<P>But I de&s;cend from the Wickedne&s;s to the Inde|cency
of the Matter; its being a Sin again&s;t God,
is not &s;o much the pre&s;ent Argument, as its being
unmannerly, a Sin again&s;t Breeding, and Society,
a Breach of Behaviour, and a &s;aucy in&s;olent Af|front
to all the Company.</P>
<P>I do not deny, but that Mode&s;ty, as it re&s;pects
the Covering our Bodies, was at fir&s;t an Effect of
the Fall of our Parents into Crime, and is there|fore
&s;aid &s;till to be the Con&s;equences of criminal
Nature, and no Virtue in it&s;elf, becau&s;e no Part
of the Body had been unfit to be expo&s;ed, if
Vice had not made the Di&s;tinction nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>But from this very Argument, lewd Di&s;cour&s;e ap|pears
to be a Sin again&s;t Cu&s;tom and Decency; for
why mu&s;t the Tongue indu&s;triou&s;ly expo&s;e Things
and Actions at which Nature blu&s;hes, and which
Cu&s;tom, <HI>let the Original be what it will,</HI> has dedi|cated
<PB N="107" REF="123">
to Privacy and Retirement? What if
it be true, that Shame is the Con&s;equence of Sin,
and that Mode&s;ty is not an original Virtue; it
cannot but be allowed, that Sin has thereby
brought us to a Nece&s;&s;ity of making Mode&s;ty be
a Virtue, and Sin would have a double Influence
upon us, if after it had made us a&s;ham'd, it &s;hould
make us not a&s;ham'd again.</P>
<P>'Tis in my Opinion a Mi&s;take, when we &s;ay,
Sin was the immediate Cau&s;e of Shame; 'twas Sin
indeed gave a Nudity to our Natures and Acti|ons;
the Innocence which &s;erv'd as a Glory and
Covering, being gone, then Shame came in as
the Effect of the con&s;cious Sinner; &s;o the Text
&s;ays, <HI>They knew that they were naked:</HI> Shame was
the Effect of Nakedne&s;s, as Nakedne&s;s was the
Effect of Sin.</P>
<P>From hence then I argue, and this is the Rea|&s;on
of my naming it, That to be a&s;ham'd of our
Nakedne&s;s, is a Token of our Wi&s;dom, and a
Monument of our ju&s;t Sen&s;e of the fir&s;t Sin that
made it &s;o, and as much a Duty now, as any
other Part of our Repentance.</P>
<P>To give the Tongue then a Liberty in that which
there is &s;o much Rea&s;on to blu&s;h at, argues no
Sen&s;e of the Original Degeneracy. Where is
the Man that partakes not of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall, has
no vicious contracted Habit and Nature convey'd
to him from his Grand-Predece&s;&s;or? Let him
come forth, let him go naked, and live by him&s;elf,
and let his Po&s;terity partake of his Innocence;
his Tongue cannot offend, nothing can be inde|cent
for him to &s;ay, nothing uncomely for him
to &s;ee.</P>
<P>But if the&s;e Gentlemen think it proper to cover
their Nakedne&s;s with their Clothes, methinks
they &s;hould not be always uncovering it again
<PB N="108" REF="124">
with their Tongues; if there are &s;ome needful
Things, which Nature requires to be done in &s;e|cret,
and which they by Inclination chu&s;e to act
in Private: What Rea&s;on can they give for &s;peak|ing
of them in Publick.</P>
<P>There is a &s;trange Incongruity in the Behaviour
of the&s;e People, that they fill their Months with
the foul Repetition of Actions, and Things which
their own Practicing in Private condems them for,
nay, which they would be a&s;ham'd to do in Pub|lick;
&s;uch Men ought to act the common Require|ments
of Nature, in the mo&s;t publicke&s;t Places of
the Streets, bring their Wives or Whores to the
Exchange, and to the Market Places, and lye
with them in the Street, or el&s;e hold their Tongues,
and let their Mouths have no more the Stench of
their Vices in Publick, than their Actions.</P>
<P>And why of all the re&s;t of the Parts of Life,
mu&s;t the Tongue take a peculiar Licence to re|vel
thus upon Nature? as if &s;he had a Mind to
reproach her with the Infirmities &s;he labours un|der:
The Cu&s;toms we are obliged to, tho' they are
Cloggs upon Nature, and a Badge of original
Defection; yet neither is there any thing &s;o odi|ous,
or &s;o burden&s;ome, that the&s;e Gentlemen
&s;hould triumph over the Nur&s;e that brought them
up.</P>
<P>Take the lewde&s;t and mo&s;t vicious Wretch that
ever gave his Tongue a Loo&s;e in this hateful Pra|ctice,
and turn him about to his Mother, you &s;hall
hardly prevail upon him to talk his lewd Language
to her; there is &s;omething nau&s;eous and &s;urfeiting
in that Thought. This talking Bawdy, is like
a Man going to debauch his own Mother; for
'tis raking into the <HI>Arcana,</HI> and expo&s;ing the Na|kedne&s;s
of Nature, the common Mother of us all.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="125">
If, as a famous Man of Wit pretended, lying
with a Woman was <HI>the homlie&s;t thing that Man can
do;</HI> 'tis much more true, that talking of it is the
homlie&s;t thing that Man can &s;ay.</P>
<P>Nor is there <HI>to me</HI> any Je&s;t in the&s;e things, no
Appearance of Mirth: There may be &s;ome Plea|&s;ure
in wicked Actions, as the World rates Plea|&s;ure,
but I mu&s;t profe&s;s 'tis dull, and for Want of
other more regular Ta&s;tes, that there &s;hould be
Plea&s;ure in the Di&s;cour&s;e: 'Tis a prophaning of
Nature, and bringing forth tho&s;e Things &s;he has
hallowed to Secre&s;y and Retirement, to the &s;can|dalous
Indecency of publick Banter and Je&s;t.</P>
<P>But Men, who have always &s;omething to &s;ay
for their Folly, tell us, 'tis Cu&s;tom only which
has made any of the&s;e things uncommon; and
there's no Sin in &s;peaking that which there is no
Sin in doing.</P>
<P>Let us grant them, that Cu&s;tom only has done
this: But if Cu&s;tom has made the&s;e things uncom|mon,
and conceal'd, or at lea&s;t, bani&s;h'd them
from the Voice of Conver&s;ation. 'Tis a Sin then
again&s;t Cu&s;tom to expo&s;e them again. Lawful
Cu&s;toms become allowed Virtues, and ought to
be pre&s;erved. Cu&s;tom is a good Rea&s;on in &s;uch
Concealments; if Cu&s;tom has lock'd them up, let
them remain &s;o; at lea&s;t, till you can give a bet|ter
Rea&s;on for calling them abroad again, than
Cu&s;tom has given for re&s;training them. Cu&s;tom
has made the&s;e things uncommon, becau&s;e that
Sin, which fir&s;t made Nature naked, left her &s;o
captivated, by &s;ome of her Parts more than others,
that &s;he could not but blu&s;h at tho&s;e, where Sin
had taken up its peculiar Re&s;idence. Now, as I
noted before, no Man can with any tolerable Sati&s;|faction,
expo&s;e the Parts, till he has fir&s;t ab&s;tra|cted
and &s;eparated the Sin, which having po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
<PB N="110" REF="126">
them, $word$ them at fir&s;t with Shame: He
that can do this, may go naked, and talk any
thing.</P>
<P>And for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, no Man can ju&s;tify
talking lewd$, but $word$ that at the &s;ame Time
thro'vs away his Clothes, for to cover him&s;elf
with his Hands, and uncover him&s;elf with his
Tongue, are Contradictons in their own Nature,
and one condemns the other&punc; He that &s;corns the
Decency of Words, &s;hould al&s;o &s;corn the Decen|cy
of Clothes, let his Body be as bald as his
Di&s;cour&s;e, and let him &s;corn the Shame of one, as
well as the Shame of the other.</P>
<P>It is no Sin, they &s;ay, to talk of, what it is no
Sin to do; and I may add, 'tis no Sin at all to
&s;hew, what 'tis no Sin to de&s;cribe. Why is the
Eye to be le&s;s offended than the Ear, &s;ince both are

are that &s;ort of People, who having once told a
Story fal&s;ly, tell it &s;o often in the &s;ame or like
manner, till they really believe it to be true.</P>
<P>This &s;upplying a Story by Invention, is certainly
a mo&s;t &s;candalous Crime and yet very little regarded
in that Part, it is a &s;ort of Lying that makes a great
Hole in the Heart, at which by Degrees a Habit
of Lying enters in: Such a Man comes quick|ly
up, to a total di&s;regarding the Truth of what he
&s;ays, looking upon it as a Trifle, a Thing of no
import, whether any Story he tells be true or no,
&s;o it but commands the Company as they call it;
that is to &s;ay, procures a Laugh, or a kind of Amaze|ent
Things equally agreeable to the&s;e Story-Tellers;
for the Bu&s;ine&s;s is to affect the Com|pany,
either &s;tartle them with &s;omething wonder|ful,
never heard of before; or make them laugh
immoderately, as at &s;omething prodigiou&s;ly ta|king,
witty, and diverting.</P>
<P>It is hard to place this Practice in a Station e|qual
to its Folly, 'tis a Meanne&s;s below the Digni|$y
of common Sen&s;e: They that lye to gain, to
deceive, to deludes, to betray as above, have &s;ome
End in thei$ Wickedne&s;s; and though they can|not
give the De&s;ign for an excu&s;e of their Crime,
$et it may be given as the Rea&s;on and Founda|$ion
of it: But to lye for Sport, for <HI>Fun, as the
<PB N="114" REF="130">
Boys expre&s;s it,</HI> is to play at Shuttle-cock with your
Soul, and load your Con&s;cience for the meer fake
of being a Fool, and the making A meer Buffoonry
of a Story, the Plea&s;ure of what is below even
Madne&s;s it&s;elf.</P>
<P>And yet, how common is this Folly? How
is it the Character of &s;ome Men's Conver&s;ation,
that they are made up of Story? And how mean
a Figure is it they bear in Company? Such Men
always betray their Emptine&s;s by this, and ha|ving
only a certain Number of Tales in their
Budget, like a Pedlar with his Pack, they can
only at every Hou&s;e &s;hew the &s;ame Ware over
again, tell the &s;ame Story over and over, 'till the
Je&s;t is quite worn out; and to convince us, that
much of it, <HI>if not all,</HI> is born of Invention, they
&s;eldom tell it the &s;ame Way twice, but vary it
even in the mo&s;t material Facts: So that though
it may be remembred, that it was the &s;ame Story,
it ought never to be remembred, that it was told
by the &s;ame Man.</P>
<P>With what Temper &s;hould I &s;peak of the&s;e
People? What Words can expre&s;s the Meanne&s;s
and Ba&s;ene&s;s of the Mind, that can do thus? that &s;in
without De&s;ign, and not only have no End in
the View, but even no Reflection in the Act: the
Folly is grown up to a Habit, and they not only
mean no Ill, but indeed mean nothing at all in it.</P>
<P>It is a &s;trange Length that &s;ome People
run in this Madne&s;s of Life, and it is &s;o odd, &s;o
unaccountable, that indeed 'tis difficult to de&s;cribe
the Man, tho' not difficult to de&s;cribe the Fact&punc;
what Idea can be form'd in the Mind, of a Man,
who does ill without meaning ill? that wrongs
him&s;elf, affronts Truth, and impo&s;es upon his
Friends, and yet means no Harm; or to u&s;e his own
Words, means nothing? That if he thinks any
<PB N="115" REF="131">
Thing, 'tis to make the Company plea&s;ant, and
what is this but making <HI>the Circle</HI> a Stage, and
him&s;elf the Merry <HI>Andrew.</HI></P>
<P>The be&s;t Step &s;uch Men can take is to LYE
ON; <HI>and this &s;hews the Singularity of the Crime;</HI> it
is a &s;trange Expre&s;&s;ion, but I &s;hall make it out; their
Way is, I &s;ay, to Lye on; 'till their Character is
compleatly known, and then they can lye no long|er;
for he whom no Body believes, can deceive no
Body, and then the E&s;&s;ence of Lying is removed; for
the De&s;cription of a Lye is, that 'tis &s;poken to
deceive, or 'tis a De&s;ign to deceive. Now, he
that no Body believes, can never lye any more,
becau&s;e no Body can be deciev'd by him. Such
a Man's Character is a Bill upon his Forehead, by
which every Body knows, <HI>Here dwells a Lying
Tongue:</HI> When every Body knows what is to be
had of him, they know what to expect; and &s;o
no Body is deceiv'd; if they believe him after|wards,
'tis their Fault as much as his.</P>
<P>There are a great many Sorts of tho&s;e People,
who make it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to go about telling
Stories; it would be endle&s;s to enumerate them,
&s;ome tell formal Stories forg'd in their own Brain
without any Retro&s;pect either on Per&s;ons or Things;
I mean, as to any particular Per&s;on, or Pa&s;&s;age
known, or in Being, and only with the ordinary
Introduction of, <HI>There was a Man,</HI> or, <HI>there was
a Woman,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>Others again, out of the &s;ame Forge of Inven|tion,
hammer out the very Per&s;on, Man or Wo|man,
and begin, <HI>I knew the Man,</HI> or <HI>I knew the Wo|man,</HI>
and the&s;e ordinarily vouch their Story with
more A&s;&s;urance than others; and vouch al&s;o, that
they knew the Per&s;ons who were concern'd in it.</P>
<P>The &s;elling or writing a Parable, or an allu|&s;ive
allogorick Hi&s;tory is quite a different Ca&s;e,
<PB N="116" REF="132">
and is always Di&s;tingui&s;ht from this other Je&s;t|ing
with Truth; that it is de&s;ign'd and effectually
turn'd for in&s;tructive and upright Ends, and has
its Moral ju&s;tly apply'd: Such are the hi&s;torical
Parables in the holy Scripture, &s;uch the Pilgrims
Progre&s;s, and &s;uch in a Word the Adventures of
your fugitive Friend, <HI>Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe.</HI></P>
<P>Others make no Scruple to relate real Stories
with innumerable Omi&s;&s;ions and Additions: I
mean, Stories which have a real Exi&s;tence in Fact,
but which by the barbarous Way of relating, be|come
as romantick and fal&s;e, as if they had no real
Original. The&s;e Tales, like the old Galley of
<HI>Venice,</HI> which had been &s;o often new vamped,
doubl'd and redoubl'd, that there was not one
Piece of the fir&s;t Timber in her, have been told
wrong &s;o often, and &s;o many Ways, 'till there
would not be one Circum&s;tance of the real Story
left in the relating.</P>
<P>There are many more Kinds of the&s;e, &s;uch
namely, as are per&s;onal and malicious, full of
Slander and Abu&s;e; but the&s;e are not of the
Kinds I am &s;peaking of; the pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s is
among a Kind of white Devils, who do no
Harm or Injury to any but to them&s;elves; they
are like the Gra&s;hopper, that &s;pends his Time
to divert the Traveller, and does nothing but
&s;tarve him&s;elf. The Conver&s;ation of the&s;e Men
is <HI>full of Emptine&s;s,</HI> their Words are Levity it&s;elf,
and according to the Text, they not only tell Un|truths,
but <HI>the Truth is not in them.</HI> There is not
a &s;ettl'd Awe or Reverence of Truth upon their
Minds; 'tis a Thing of no Value to them, 'tis
not regarded in their Di&s;cour&s;e, and they give
them&s;elves a Liberty to be perfectly unconcern'd
about the Thing they &s;ay, or the Story they tell,
whether it be true, or no.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="133">
This is a mo&s;t abominable Practice on another
Account, namely, that the&s;e Men make a Je&s;t of
their Crime; they are a Sort of People that Sin
laughing; that play upon their Souls as a Man
plays upon a Fiddle, to make other People dance
and wear it&s;elf out; they may be &s;aid to make
&s;ome Sport indeed, but it is all at them&s;elves,
they are the Hearers Comedy and their own Tra|gedy;
and like a penitent Jack-pudding, they will
at la&s;t &s;ay, I have made others merry, but I have
been the Fool.</P>
<P>I would be glad to &s;hame Men of common
Sen&s;e, out of this horrid Piece of Buffoonry; and
one Thing I would warn them of, namely, that
their learning to Lye &s;o currently in Story, will
in&s;en&s;ibly bring them to a bold entrenching upon
Truth, in the re&s;t of their Conver&s;ation; the
Scripture Command is, <HI>Let every Man &s;peak Truth
unto his Neighbour;</HI> if we mu&s;t tell Stories, tell
them as Stories, add nothing willfully to illu&s;trate
or &s;et it forth in the Relation; if you doubt the
Truth of it, &s;ay &s;o, and then every one will be at
Liberty to bel$eve their Share of it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there is a &s;preading Evil in telling a
fal&s;e Story as true, namely, that you put it into
the Mouths of others, and it continues a brooding
Forgery to the End of Time; 'tis a Chimney-corner
Romance, and has in it this di&s;tingui&s;hing Article,
that whereas Parables, and the Inventions of Men
publi&s;h'd Hi&s;torically, are once for all related,
and the Moral being drawn, the Hi&s;tory re|mains
allu&s;ive only, as it was intended, as in &s;eve|ral

and without; here the Ca&s;e alters, Fraud goes unto
the World's End, for Story, never dies every Rela|tor
Vouches it for Truth, tho' he knows nothing
of the Matter.</P>
<P>The&s;e Men know not what Foundations they
are laying for handing on the Sport of Lying, <HI>for
&s;uch they make of it</HI> to Po&s;terity, not only leaving
the Example, but dictating the very Materials for
the Practice; like Family-Lies handed on from
Father to Son, till what begun in Forgery Ends
in Hi&s;tory, and we make our Lies be told for
Truth, by all our Children that come after us.</P>
<P>If any Man object here, that the preceeding

<P>Truly, the main Bu&s;ine&s;s that Mankind
&s;eems to be doing, is to eat and drink, that's their
Enjoyment, and to get Food to eat is their Em|ployment,
including a little, their eating and

<P>It is &s;o in the Fir&s;t Part, namely, their
Living to eat and drink: But in the la&s;t Part they
are wor&s;e than the Brutes; for the Brutes de&s;troy
not their own Kind, but all prey upon a different
Species; and be&s;ides, they prey upon one another,
for Nece&s;&s;ity, to &s;atisfy their Hunger, and for
Food: But Man for ba&s;er Ends, &s;uch as Ava|rice,
Envy, Revenge, and the like; devours his

mean the Savage Life; where the chief End of
Life &s;eems to be meerly to eat and drink, that is
to &s;ay, to get their Food, ju&s;t as the brutal Life
is employ'd, and indeed with very little Difference
between them; for except only Speech and Ido|latry,
I &s;ee nothing in the Life of &s;ome whole Na|tions

<P>I thought this &s;erious old Lady would have en|tertain'd
a farther Di&s;cour&s;e with me on &s;o fruit|ful
a Subject; but &s;he declin'd it, and left me to
my own Meditation, which indeed &s;he had rais'd
up to an unu&s;ual Pitch: And the fir&s;t thing that
occurr'd to me, was to put me upon enquiring
after that nice thing, I ought to call Religion, in
the World; &s;eeing really I found Rea&s;on to think,
<PB N="126" REF="142">
that there was much more Devotion than Religion
in the World; in a Word, much more Adoration
than Supplication: And I doubt, as I come nearer
Home, it will appear, that there is much more
Hypocri&s;y than Sincerity: Of which I may &s;peak
by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In my fir&s;t Enquiries, I look'd back upon my
own Travels, and it afforded me but a melancho|ly
Reflection, that in all the Voyages and Tra|vels
which I have employ'd two Volumes in giving
a Relation of, I never &s;et my Foot in a Chri&s;tian
Country, no not in circling three Parts of the
Globe; for, excepting the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> where the
<HI>Portug$e&s;e</HI> indeed profe&s;s'd the Roman-Catholick
Principles, which however, in Di&s;tinction from
Pagani&s;m, I will call the Chri&s;tian Religion; I
&s;ay, except the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> where al&s;o I made little
Stay, I could not be &s;aid to &s;et Foot in a Chri&s;ti|an
Country, or a Country inhabited by Chri&s;tians,
from the Bay of <HI>La'rache,</HI> and the Port of <HI>Sallee,</HI>
by the <HI>Straits</HI> Mouth, where I e&s;cap'd from Slave|ry,
thro' the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, the Coa&s;ts of
<HI>Africk</HI> on one Side, and of <HI>Carribbea</HI> on the <HI>Ameri|can</HI>
Shore, on the other Side; from thence to <HI>Ma|daga&s;car,
Malabar,</HI> and the Bay and City of <HI>Bon|gale,</HI>
the Coa&s;t of <HI>Sumatra, Malacca, Siam, Cambo|dia,
Cochinchina,</HI> the Empire and Coa&s;t of <HI>China,</HI>
the De&s;arts of <HI>Karakathay,</HI> the <HI>Mongul Tartars,</HI> the
<HI>Siberian,</HI> the <HI>Samoiede Barbarians,</HI> and till I came
within four or five Days of <HI>Arch-Angel</HI> in the <HI>Black
Ru&s;&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>It is, I &s;ay, a melancholy Reflection to think,
how all the&s;e Parts of the World, and with infinite
Numbers of Millions of People, furni&s;h'd with the
Powers of Rea&s;on, and Gifts of Nature, and ma|ny
Ways, if not every Way, as capable of the
Reception of &s;ublime things, as we are, are yet
<PB N="127" REF="143">
abandon'd to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Ignorance and Depra|vity;
and that not in Religion only, but even in
all the de&s;irable Parts of humane Knowledge,
and e&s;pecially Science and acqui$'d Knowledge.</P>
<P>What the Divine Wi&s;dom has determined con|cerning
the Souls of &s;o many Millions, it is hard
to conclude, nor is it my pre&s;ent De&s;ign to en|quire;
but this I may be allow'd here, as a Re|mark:
If they are received to Mercy in a Fu|ture
State, according to the Opinion of &s;ome,
as having not &s;in'd again&s;t &s;aving Light, then their
Ignorance and Pagan Darkne&s;s is not a Cur&s;e, but
a Felicity; and there are no unhappy People in
the World, but tho&s;e lo&s;t among Chri&s;tians, for
their Sins again&s;t reveal'd Light; nay, then being
born in the Regions of Chri&s;tian Light, and un|der
the Revelation of the Go&s;pel Doctrines, is not
&s;o much a Mercy to be acknowledged as &s;ome
teach us, and it may in a negative Manner be true,
that the Chri&s;tian Religion is an Efficient in the
Condemnation of Sinners, and lo&s;es more than it
&s;aves, which is impious but to imagin: On the o|ther
Hand, if all tho&s;e Nations are concluded
under the Sentence of eternal Ab&s;ence from God,
which is Hell in the Ab&s;tract; then what becomes
of all the &s;ceptical Doctrines of its being incon|&s;i&s;tent
with the Mercy and Goodne&s;s of an infi|nite
and beneficent Being, to condemn &s;o great a
Part of the World, for not believing in him of
whom they never had any Knowledge or In&s;tru|ction?
But I de&s;ire not to be the Promoter of un|an&s;werable
Doubts in Matters of Religion; much
le&s;s would I promote Cavils at the Foundations
of Religion, either as to its Profe&s;&s;ion or Practice,
and therefore I only name Things. I return to my
Enquiry after Religion as we generally under&s;tand
the Word.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="144">
And in this I confine my &s;elf in my pre&s;ent Enqui|ries
to the particular Nations profe&s;&s;ing the Chri|&s;tian
Religion only, and I &s;hall take Notice after|ward,
what influence the want of Religion has
upon the Manners the Genius, and the Capaci|ties
of the People, as to all the improvable Parts of
human Knowledge.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Barbary</HI> are <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and that
of the mo&s;t degenerate and unpoli&s;hed Sort, e&s;pe|cially
of that Part of the World where they live;
they are cruel as Bea&s;ts, vicious, in&s;olent, and in|human
as degenerated Nature can make them:
Moral Vertues have &s;o little recommended them|&s;elves
to any among them, that they are accounted
no Accompli&s;hment, and are in no E&s;teem; nor is
a Man at all re&s;pected for being grave, &s;ober, ju|dicious,
or wi&s;e, or for being ju&s;t in his Dealings,
or mo&s;t ea&s;y in his Conver&s;ation; but Rapine and
Injury is the Cu&s;tom of the Place; and it is to re|commend
a great Man, that he is rich, powerful
in Slaves, mercile&s;s in his Government of them,
and imperiou&s;ly haughty in his whole Hou&s;hold.
Every Man is a King within him&s;elf, and regards
neither Ju&s;tice or Mercy, Humanity or Civility,
either to them above him, or them below him,
but ju&s;t as his arbitrary Pa&s;&s;ions guide him.</P>
<P>Religion here is confin'd to the <HI>Biram</HI> and the
<HI>Ramadan,</HI> the Fea&s;t and the Fa&s;t, to the Mo&s;que
and the Bath; reading the Alcoran on one Hand,
and performing the Wa&s;hings and Purifications on
the other, make up their religious Exerci&s;es; and
for the re&s;t, Conver&s;ation is eaten up with Bar|bari&s;ms
and Bruti&s;h Cu&s;toms; &s;o that there's nei|ther
Society, Humanity, Confidence in one ano|ther,
or Conver&s;ation with one another; but Men
live like the wild Bea&s;ts, for every Man here real|ly
would de&s;troy and devour the other if the could.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="145">
This guided me to a ju&s;t Reflection&punc; in Ho|nour
of the Chri&s;tian Religion, which I have of|ten
&s;ince made U&s;e of, and which on this Occa|&s;ion
I will make a Digre&s;&s;io$ to, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is to
be &s;aid for the Reputation of the Chri&s;tian Religi|on
in general, and by which it is ju&s;tly di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd
from all other Religions, that where-ever
Chri&s;tianity has been planted or profe&s;s'd natio|nally
in the World, even where it has not had a
<HI>Saving</HI> Influence, it has yet had a <HI>Civilizing</HI> Influ|ence:
It has operated upon the Manners, the Mo|rals,
the Politics, and even the Tempers and
Di&s;po&s;itions of the People: It has reduc'd them to
the Practice of Virtue, and to the true Methods
of Living, has wean'd them from the <HI>Barbarous</HI>
Cu&s;toms they had been u&s;ed to, infu&s;ing a Kind
of Humanity and Softne&s;s of Di&s;po&s;ition into their
very Natures; civilizing and &s;oftning them, teach|ing
them to love a Regularity of <HI>L$fe,</HI> and filling
them with Principles of generous Kindne&s;s and
Beneficence one to another; in a Word, it has
taught them to live like Men, and act upon the
Foundations of Clemency, Humanity, Love, and
and good Neighbourhood, &s;uitable to the Nature
and Dignity of God's Image, and to the Rules of
Ju&s;tice and Equity, which it in&s;tructs them in.</P>
<P>Nay farther, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve al&s;o, That as the
Chri&s;tian Religion has worn out, or been remo|ved
from any Country, and they have returned to
Heatheni&s;m and Idolatry, &s;o the Barbari&s;ms have
return'd, the Cu&s;toms of the Heathen Nations have
been again re&s;tor'd; the very Nature and Temper of
the People, have been again lo&s;t; all their generous
Principles have for&s;aken them, the Softne&s;s and
Goodne&s;s of their Di&s;po&s;itions have worn out,
and they have returned to Cruelty, Inhumanity,
Rapin, and Blood.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="146">
It is true, and it may be nam'd as an Obje|ction
to this Remark of mine, that the <HI>Romans</HI>
tho' Heathens, and the <HI>Grecians</HI> by the Study of
Philo&s;ophy, in particular Per&s;ons, and by the
Excellency of their Government in their general
or national Capacity, were fill'd with Notions of
Virtue and Honour, with mo&s;t generous and ju&s;t
Principles, and acted with an heroic Mind in
many Occa&s;ions; practi&s;ing the mo&s;t &s;ublime and
exa$$ed Height of Virtue, &s;uch as &s;acrificing their
Lives for their Country, with the utmo&s;t Zeal;
de&s;cending to great Examples of Humanity and
Beneficence, &s;corning to do ba&s;e or vile Actions,
as unworthy the <HI>Roman</HI> Name, to &s;ave their
Lives; and a great many mo&s;t excellent Examples
of Virtue and Gallantry, are found in the Hi&s;to|ries
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empires.</P>
<P>This does not oppo&s;e, it rather indeed illu&s;trates
what I &s;ay; for with all the Philo&s;ophy, all the
Humanity and Gen$ro&s;ity they practis'd, they had
yet their Remains of Barbarity, were cruel and
unmerciful in their Natures, as appear'd by the
Barbarity of their Cu&s;toms, &s;uch as throwing Ma|lefactors
to wild Bea&s;ts, the Fightings of their
Gladiators, and the like; which were not only
appointed as Puni&s;hments and Severities, by the
Order of Public Ju&s;tice; but to &s;hew it touch'd the
very Article I am upon, it was the Subject of
their Sport and Diver&s;ion, the&s;e Things were ex|hibited
as Shows to entertain the Ladies; the
Cutting in Pieces fourty or fifty Slaves, and the
Seeing twenty or thirty mi&s;erable Creatures thrown
to the Lyons and Tygers, was no le&s;s plea&s;ant to
them, than the Going to $ee an Opera, a Ma&s;que|rade,
or a Puppet Show, is to us; So that I
think, the <HI>Romans</HI> were very far from a People ci|viliz'd
and $o$t$h'd in their Natures by the Influ|enc$s
<PB N="131" REF="147">
of Religion. And this is evident, becau&s;e,
that as the Chri&s;tian Religion came among them,
all tho&s;e cruel Cu&s;toms were abhorr'd by them, the
famous Theatres and Circles for their publick
Sports, were overthrown, and the Ruines of
them te&s;tify the Ju&s;tice of my Ob&s;ervation at this
very Day.</P>
<P>Nor will it be deny'd, if I &s;hould carry this yet
farther, and ob&s;erve, That even among Chri&s;tians&punc;
tho&s;e who are more reform'd, and farther and far|ther
chri&s;tianiz'd, are &s;till in Proportion rendred
more human, more &s;oft and tender; and we do
find, without being partial to our &s;elves, that even
the Prote&s;tant Countries are much di&s;tingui&s;h'd in
the Humanity and Softne&s;s of their Tempers, the
meek merciful Di&s;po&s;ition extends more among
Prote&s;tants, than among the Papi&s;ts, as I could
very particularly demon&s;trate from Hi&s;tory and
Experience.</P>
<P>But to return back to the Moores, where I left
off, they are an In&s;tance of that Cruelty of Di&s;po|&s;ition,
which was anciently in their Nature, and
how in a Country abandon'd of the true Chri&s;tian
Religion, after it has been fir&s;t planted and pro|fe&s;s'd
among them, the Return of Heatheni&s;m or
Mahometani&s;m has brought back with it all the
Barbari&s;ms of a Nation void of Religion and good
Nature.</P>
<P>I &s;aw enough of the&s;e dreadful People to think
them at this Time the wor&s;t of all the Nations of
the World; a Nation, where no &s;uch thing as a
generous Spirit, or a Temper with any Compa&s;|&s;ion
mixt with it, is to be found; among whom
Nature appears &s;tripp'd of all the additional Glo|ries,
which it derives from Religion, and yet where|on
a Chri&s;tian flouri&s;hing Church had &s;tood &s;everal
hundred Years.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="148">
From the&s;e I went among the Negroes of <HI>Afri|ca;</HI>
many of them I &s;aw without any the lea&s;t No|tion
of a Deity among them, much le&s;s any Form
or Wor&s;hip; but I had not any Occa&s;ion to con|ver&s;e
with them on Shore&punc; other than I have done
&s;ince by Accident, but went away to the <HI>Bra&s;ils:</HI>
Here I found the Natives, and that even before the
<HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> came among them, and &s;ince al&s;o, had
Abundance of Religion, <HI>&s;uch as it was:</HI> But it
was all &s;o bloody, &s;o cruel; con&s;i&s;ting of Murders,
human Sacrifices, Witchcrafts, Sor$eries, and Con|jurings,
that I could not &s;o much as call them ho|ne&s;t
Pagans, as I do the Negroes.</P>
<P>As for the Cannibals, as I have ob&s;erv'd in the
Di&s;cour&s;e of them, on Account of their Landing
on my I&s;land, I can &s;ay but very little of them:
As for their eating human Fle&s;h, I take it to be a
Kind of martial Rage, rather than a civil Pra|ctice;
for 'tis evident, they eat no human Crea|tures,
but &s;uch as are taken Pri&s;oners in their Bat|tles;
and as I have ob&s;erv'd in giving the Account
of tho&s;e things, they do not E&s;teem it Murder, no
nor &s;o much as unlawful. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;aving
its being a Practice in it&s;elf unnatural, e&s;pecially
to us, I &s;ay, &s;aving that Part, I &s;ee little Difference
between that and our Way, which in the War is
frequent in Heat of Action, <HI>viz.</HI> refu&s;ing Quarter;
for as to the Difference between Eating and Kil|ling
tho&s;e that offer to yield, it matters not much.
And this I ob&s;erved at the &s;ame Time, that in
their other Conduct, tho&s;e Savages were as human,
as mild, and gentle, as mo&s;t I have met with in
the World, and as ea&s;ily civiliz'd.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Sorts of People, I come to the <HI>Indi|ans;</HI>
for as to the <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> Men, I &s;aw very
little of them, but that they were a Kind of Ne|gr$es,
much like tho&s;e on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> on|ly,
<PB N="133" REF="149">
a little more u&s;ed and accu&s;tomed to the <HI>Euro|peans,</HI>
by their often Landing among them.</P>
<P>The <HI>E. Indians</HI> are generally Pagans or Mahome|tans,
and have &s;uch Mixtures of Savage Cu&s;toms
with them, that even Mahometani&s;m is there in
its Corruption; neither have they there, the up|right
ju&s;t Dealing in Matters of Right and Wrong,
which the <HI>Turks</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI> have, with whom 'tis
generally very &s;afe trading: But here they act all
the Parts of Thieves and Cheats, watching to de|ceive
you, and proud of being thought able to
do it.</P>
<P>The Subjects of the great <HI>Mogul</HI> have a &s;eeming
polite Government; and the Inhabitants of <HI>Cey|lon</HI>
are under very &s;trict Di&s;cipline; and yet what
Difficulty do we find to trade with them? Nay,
their very Oeconomy renders them fraudulent,
and in &s;ome places they cannot turn their
Thoughts to being hone&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>China</HI> is famous for Wi&s;dom, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> that
they, having &s;uch a boundle&s;s Conceit of their own
Wi&s;dom, we are oblig'd to allow them more than
they have; the Truth is, they are ju&s;tly &s;aid to be
a wi&s;e Nation among the fooli&s;h ones, and may
as ju&s;tly be called a Nation of Fools among the
wi&s;e ones.</P>
<P>As to their Religion, 'tis all &s;umm'd up in <HI>Con|f$cius</HI>
his Maxims, who&s;e Theology, I take to
be a Rhap&s;ody of Moral Conclu&s;ions; a Founda|tion,
or what we may call Elements of Polity,
Morality and Super&s;tition, huddl'd together in a
Rhap&s;ody of Words, without Con&s;i&s;tency, and
indeed with very little Rea&s;oning in it: Then 'tis
really not &s;o much as a refin'd Pagani&s;m, for
there are in my Opinion much more regular Do|ings
among &s;ome of the <HI>Indians</HI> that are Pagans in
<HI>America,</HI> than there are in <HI>China:</HI> And if I may be|lieve
<PB N="134" REF="150">
the Account given of the Government of
<HI>Montezuma</HI> in <HI>Mexico,</HI> and of the Unca's of <HI>Cu&s;co</HI>
in <HI>Peru;</HI> their Wor&s;hip and Religion &s;uch as it
was, was carry'd on with more Regularity than
the&s;e in <HI>China.</HI> As to the human Ingenuity, as they
call it, of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> I &s;hall account for it by it&s;elf:
The utmo&s;t Di&s;coveries of it to me appear'd in the
Mechanicks, and even in them infinitely &s;hort of
of what is found among the <HI>European</HI> Nations.</P>
<P>But let us take the&s;e People to Pieces a little,
and examine into the great Penetration, they are
&s;o fam'd for: Fir&s;t of all, their Knowledge has
not led them that Length in religio$s Matters,
which the common Notions of Philo&s;ophy would
have done, and to which they did lead the wi&s;e Hea|thens
of Old among the <HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Em|pires;
for they having not the Knowledge of the
true God, pre&s;erv'd notwith&s;tanding, the Notion
of a God to be &s;omething Immortal, Omnipo|tent,
&s;ublime; exalted above in Place, as well as
Authority; and therefore made Heaven to be
the Seat of their Gods, and the Images by
which they repre&s;ented the Gods and Godde&s;&s;es,
had always &s;ome Perfections that were really to be
admir'd; as the Attendants of their Gods, as
<HI>Jupiter</HI> was call'd the Thunderer, for his Power;
Father of Gods and Men, for his Seniority; <HI>Ve|nus</HI>
ador'd for her Beauty; <HI>Mercury</HI> for Swiftne&s;s;
<HI>Apollo</HI> for Wit, Poetry, Mu&s;ick; <HI>Mars</HI> for Terror
and Gallantry in Arms, and the like: But when
we come to the&s;e polite Nations of <HI>China,</HI> which
yet we cry up for Sen&s;e, and Greatne&s;s of Genius,
we &s;ee them groveling in the very Sink and Filth
of Idolatry; their Idols are the mo&s;t frightful mon|&s;trous
Shapes, not the Form of any real Creature,
much le&s;s the Images of Virtue, of Cha&s;tity, of Li|terature;
but horrid Shapes of their Prie&s;ts Inven|tion;

neither he$$i&s;h or human Mon&s;ters comp$s'd

nau&s;eous and abominable, into the Minds

which was in it&s;elf the mo&s;t odious and con|temptible
to Nature; not meerly terrible, that &s;o
their Wor&s;hip might proceed from Fear, but a
Complication of Nature's Aver&s;ions.</P>
<P>I cannot omit, that being in one of their Tem|ples,
or rather in a kind of Oratory or Chapel,
annexed to one Part or the great Palace at <HI>Peguin,</HI>
there appear'd a Mandarin with his Attendants,
or, as we may &s;ay, a great Lord and his Retinue,
pro&s;trate before the Image, not of any one of God's
Creatures, but a Creature of meer human Forming,
&s;uch as neither was alive, nor was like any thing
that had Life, or had ever been &s;een or heard of
in the World.</P>
<P>The like Image, or &s;omething wor&s;e, if
I could give it a true Repre&s;entation, may be
found in a Garden Chapel, if not defac'd by wi|&s;er
Heads, of a great <HI>Tartarian</HI> Mandarin, at a
&s;mall Di&s;tance from <HI>Nanquin,</HI> and to which the
poor abandon'd Creatures, pay their mo&s;t blinded
Devotions.</P>
<P>It had a thing in&s;tead of a Head, but no Head;
it had a Mouth di&s;torted out of all Manner of
Shape, and not to be de&s;er$bed for a Mouth, being
only an un&s;$apen Cha&s;m, neither repre&s;enting the
Mouth of a Man, Bea&s;t, Fowl, or Fi&s;h: The
Thing was neither any of the four, but an incon|gruous
Mon&s;ter: It had Feet, Hands, Fingers,
Claws, Legs, Arms, Wings, Ears, Horns, every
Thing mixt one among another, neither in the
Shape or Place that Nature appointed, but blend|ed
together, and fix'd to a Bulk, not a Body;
form'd of no ju&s;t Parts, but a &s;hapele&s;s Trunk or
Log; whether of Wood or Stone, I know not;
<PB N="137" REF="153">
a thing that might have &s;tood with any Side for|ward,
or any Side backward, any End upward,
or any End downward, that had as much Vene|ration
due to it on one Side, as on the other, a
kind of cele&s;tial Hedge-hog, that was rolled up
within it&s;elf, and was every thing every Way; that
to a Chri&s;tian could not have been worthy to have
repre&s;ented even the Devil; and to Men of common
Sen&s;e, mu&s;t have been their very Souls Aver&s;ion&punc;
In a Word, if I have not represented their mon|&s;trous
Deities right, let Imagination &s;upply any|thing
that can make a mis&s;hapen Image horrid,
frightful, and &s;urpri&s;ing; And you may with Ju|&s;tice
&s;uppo&s;e, tho&s;e &s;agacious People, called the
<HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> whom for&s;ooth we mu&s;t admire, I &s;ay,
you may &s;uppo&s;e them pro&s;trate on the Ground,
with all their Pomp and Pageanty, which is in it
&s;elf not a little, wor&s;hipping &s;uch a mangled, pro|mi&s;cuous
gendred Creature.</P>
<P>Shall we call the&s;e a wi&s;e Nation, who repre|&s;ent
God in &s;uch hideous mon&s;trous Figures as
the&s;e, and can pro&s;trate them&s;elves to things ten
thou&s;and Times more disfigured than the Devil?
Had the&s;e Images been contriv'd in the <HI>Romans</HI>
Time, and been &s;et up for the God of Ugline&s;s,
as they had their God of Beauty, they might in|deed
have been thought exqui&s;ite; but the <HI>Ro|mans</HI>
would have &s;purn'd &s;uch an Image out of their
Temples.</P>
<P>Nothing can render a Nation &s;o compleatly
fooli&s;h and &s;imple, as &s;uch an Extravagance in
Matters of religious Wor&s;hip; for if gro&s;s Igno|rance
in the Notion of a God, which is &s;o ex|tremely
natural, will not demon&s;trate a Nation
unpoli&s;h'd, fooli&s;h, and weak, even next to Ideo|ti&s;m,
I know nothing that will.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="154">
But let me trace this wi&s;e Nation that we talk
&s;o much of, and who not only think them&s;elves
wi&s;e, but have drawn us in, to pay a Kind of Ho|mage
to their low-priz'd Wit.</P>
<P>Government, and the Mechanick Arts, are the
two main things in which our People in <HI>England,</HI>
who have admir'd them &s;o much, pretend they
excel; as to their Government, which con&s;i&s;ts in
an ab&s;olute Tyranny, which, by the Way, is the
ea&s;ie&s;t Way of Ruling in the World, where the
People are di&s;pos'd to obey, as blindly as the
<HI>Mandarin</HI> commands or governs imperiou&s;ly;
what Policy is required in governing a Peo|ple,
of whom 'tis &s;aid, that if you command them to
hang them&s;elves, they will only cry a little, and &s;ub|mit
immediately? Their Maxims of Government
may do well enough among them&s;elves, but with
us they would be all Confu&s;ion. In their Country
it is not &s;o, only becau&s;e, whatever the <HI>Man|darin</HI>
&s;ays, is a Law, and God him&s;elf has no
Power or Intere&s;t among them to contradict it,
unle&s;s he plea&s;es to execute it <HI>brevi manu</HI> from
Heaven.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of their Laws con&s;i&s;t in immediate Judg|ment,
&s;wift Executions, ju&s;t Re$aliations, and
fair Protection from Injuries: Their Puni&s;hments
are cruel and exorbitant, &s;uch as Cutting the Hands
and the Feet off for Theft, at the &s;ame Time re|lea&s;ing
Murders and other flagrant Crimes.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Mandarines</HI> are their Judges in very many
Ca&s;es, like our Ju&s;tices of the Peace; but then
they judge by Cu&s;toms, Oral Tradition, or im|mediate
Opinion, and execute the Sentence im|mediately,
without room, or Time to reflect
upon the Ju&s;tice of it, or to con&s;ider of Mitigations,
as in all Chri&s;tian Countries is practi&s;ed, and as
the Sen&s;e of human Frailty would direct.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="155">
But let me come to their Mechanics, in which
their Ingenuity is &s;o much cry'd up, I affirm there is
little or nothing &s;ufficient to build the mighty Opi|nion
we have of them upon, but what is founded up|on
the Compari&s;ons which we make between them
and other Pagan Nations, or proceeds from the
Wonder which we make, that they &s;hould have
any Knowledge of Mechanics Arts, becau&s;e we
find the remote Inhabitants of <HI>Afric</HI> and <HI>America,</HI>
&s;o gro&s;sly ignorant, and &s;o entirely de&s;titute in &s;uch
things; whereas we do not con&s;ider, that the <HI>Chi|ne&s;es</HI>
inhabit the Continent of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and tho' they
are &s;eparated by De&s;arts and Wilderne&s;&s;es, yet
they are a continuous Continent of Land, with
the Parts of the World once inhabited by the poli|ter
<HI>Medes, Per&s;ians,</HI> and <HI>Grecians;</HI> that the fir&s;t
Ideas of Mechanic Arts were probably receiv'd
by them from the <HI>Per&s;ians, A&s;&s;yrians,</HI> and the ba|ni&s;h'd
tran&s;planted <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> who are &s;aid to be
carry'd into the Regions of <HI>Parthia,</HI> and the Bor|ders
of <HI>Karacathay,</HI> from whence they are al&s;o &s;aid
to have communicated Arts, and e&s;pecially Han|dicraft,
in which the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> excell'd, to the In|habitants
of all tho&s;e Countries, and con&s;equently
in Time to tho&s;e beyond them.</P>
<P>But let them be received from whom they will,
and how long ago &s;oever; let us but compare the
Improvement they have made, with what others
have made; and except in things peculiar to them|&s;elves
by their Climate, we &s;hall find the utmo&s;t
of their Ingenuity amounts but to a very Tri$le, and
that they are out-done even in the be&s;t of their
Works by our ordinary Arti&s;ts, who&s;e Imitations
exceed their Originals, beyond all Compari&s;on.</P>
<P>For Example, they have Gun-powder and Guns,
whether they have learned to make them by Di|rection
of <HI>Europeans,</HI> which is mo&s;t likely, or that
<PB N="140" REF="156">
they found it out by meer Strength of Invention,
as &s;ome would advance, tho' without Certainty,
in their Favour: Be it which it will, as I &s;ay,
it matters not much; their Powder is of no
Strength for the needful Operations of Sieges,
Mines, Batteries, no nor for &s;hooting of Birds, as
ours is, without great Quantities put together;
their Guns are rather an O&s;tentation than for Exe|cution,
clum&s;y, heavy, and ill made; neither have
they arriv'd to any tolerable Degree of Know|ledge
in the Art of Gunnery or Engineering; they
have no Bombs, Carca&s;&s;es, Hand-grenades; their
artificial Fireworks are in no Degree comparable,
or to be nam'd with ours; nor have they arriv'd to
any thing in the military Skill, in martialling Ar|mies,
handling Arms, Di&s;cipline, and the Exer|ci&s;e
in the Field, as the <HI>Europeans</HI> have; all
which is depending on the Improvement of Fire-Arms,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> in which, if they have had the U&s;e of
Gun-powder &s;o many Ages as &s;ome Dream, they
mu&s;t be unaccountable Blockheads, that they have
made no farther Improvement; and if it is but
lately, they are yet apparently dull enough in the
managing of it, at lea&s;t, compar'd to what ought
to be expected of an ingenious People, &s;uch as our
People cry them up to be.</P>
<P>I might go from this to their Navigation, in
which it is true they out-do mo&s;t of their Neigh|bours:
But what is all their Skill in Sailing com|par'd
to ours? Whither do they go? And how
manage the little and fooli&s;h Barks and Jonks they
have? What would they do with them to traver&s;e
the great <HI>Indian, American,</HI> or <HI>Atlantic</HI> Oceans?
What Ships, what Sailors, what poor, awkard,
and ignorant Doings is there among them at Sea?
And when our People hire any of them, as &s;ome|times
they are oblig'd to do, How do our Sailors
<PB N="141" REF="157">
kick them about, as a Parcel of clum&s;y, ignorant&punc;
unhandy Fellows?</P>
<P>Then for building of Ships, What are they?
And what are they able to do towards the glo|rious
Art of building a large Man of War? 'Tis
out of Doubt with me, that all the People of
<HI>China</HI> could not build &s;uch a Ship as the <HI>Royal So|vereign,</HI>
in a hundred Years, no not tho' &s;he
was there for them to look at, and take Pattern
by.</P>
<P>I might go on to abundance more things, &s;uch
as Painting, making Gla&s;&s;es, making Clocks and
Watches, making Bone-lace, Frame-work Knit|ting;
of all which, except the two fir&s;t, they know
little or nothing; and of the two fir&s;t, nothing
compar'd to what is done in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Height of their Ingenuity, and for which
we admire them with more Colour of Cau&s;e than
in other things, is their Porcella$n or Earthen|ware
Work, which, in a Word, is more due to
the excellent Compo&s;ition of the Earth they make
them of, and which is their Peculiar, than to
the Workman&s;hip, in which, if we had the &s;ame
Clay, we &s;hould &s;oon outdo them, as much as we
do in other things. The next Art is, their Ma|nufacturing
in fine Silks, Cotton, Herba, Gold,
and Silver, in which they have nothing but what
is in common with our ordinary poor Weavers.</P>
<P>The next Mechanic Art is, their Lacquering,
which is ju&s;t as in the <HI>China</HI> Ware, a Peculiar to
their Country, in the Materials, not at all in the
Workman&s;hip: And as for the Cabinet Work of
it, they are manife&s;tly out-done by us; and abun|dance
is every Year &s;ent thither fram'd and made in
<HI>England,</HI> and only lacquer'd in <HI>China,</HI> to be re|turn'd
to us.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="158">
I might run the like Parallel thro' mo&s;t of the
things the&s;e People excel in, which would all ap|pear
to be &s;o deficient,, as would render all their
fam'd Wi&s;dom and Capacity mo&s;t &s;candalou&s;ly
imperfect: But I am not &s;o$much upon their Cun|ning
in Arts, as upon their Ab&s;urdity and ridicu|lous
Folly in Matters religious, and in which I
think the rude&s;t <HI>Barbarians</HI> out-do them.</P>
<P>From this wi&s;e Nation, we have a va&s;t Extent
of Ground, near 2000 Miles in Breadth; partly
under the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Government, partly under the
<HI>Mu&s;covite,</HI> but inhabited by <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Mongul Tar|tary,
Karkathay, Siberian,</HI> and <HI>Samoides</HI> Pagans;
who&s;e Idols are almo&s;t as hideous as the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI>
and who&s;e Religion is all Nature; and not only &s;o,
but Nature under the greate&s;t Degeneracy, and
next to Brutal. <HI>Father La Comte</HI> gives us the Pi|ctures
or &s;ome of their Hou&s;e Idols, and an Ac|count
of their Wor&s;hip; and this la&s;ts, as I have
ob&s;erv'd, to within a few Days of <HI>Arch-Angel&punc;</HI>
So that, in a Word, from the Mouth of the <HI>Straits,</HI>
that is to &s;ay, from <HI>Sallee</HI> over to <HI>Caribbea,</HI> from
thence round <HI>Africa</HI> by the Cape of good Hope,
cro&s;s the va&s;t <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean, and upon all the
Coa&s;t of it, about by <HI>Malacca</HI> and <HI>Sumatra,</HI> thro'
the Straits of <HI>Sincapore</HI> and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Siam</HI> North|wards
to <HI>China,</HI> and thro' <HI>China</HI> by Land over the
De&s;arts of the Grand <HI>Tartary,</HI> to the River <HI>Dwi|na,</HI>
being a Circuit three Times the Diameter of
the Earth, and every jot as far as the whole Cir|cumference.
The Name of God is not heard of,
except among a few of the <HI>Indians</HI> that are Ma|hometan;
the Word of God is not known, or
the Son of God &s;poken of.</P>
<P>Having &s;ome Warmth in my Search after Re|ligion,
occa&s;ion'd by this Reflection, and &s;o little
o$ it appearing in all the Parts which I had tra|vel'd,
<PB N="143" REF="159">
I re&s;olv'd to travel over the re&s;t of the
World in Books, for my wandring Days are pretty
well over; I &s;ay, I re&s;olv'd to travel the re&s;t in
Books; and &s;ure, &s;aid I, there mu&s;t appear abun|dance
of &s;erious Religion in the re&s;t of the World,
or el&s;e I know nothing at all of where I &s;hall find
it.</P>
<P>But I find by my Reading, ju&s;t as I did in Tra|velling,
that all the Cu&s;toms of Nations, as to
Religion, were much alike; that one with ano|ther,
they are more devout in their Wor&s;hip of
&s;omething, <HI>whatever it be,</HI> than inqui&s;itive after
what it is they wor&s;hip; and mo&s;t of the Altars
of Wor&s;hip in the World, might to this Day be
in&s;crib'd to the Unknown God.</P>
<P>This may &s;eem a &s;trange thing; but that Won|der
may cea&s;e, when farther Enquiry is made into
the particular Objects of Wor&s;hip, which the &s;e|veral
Nations of the World bow down to, &s;ome of
which, are &s;o horrid, &s;o ab&s;urd, as one would
think human Nature could not &s;ink &s;o low, as to do
her Homage in &s;o irrational a Manner.</P>
<P>And here, being to &s;peak of Religion as idola|trous,
it occurs to me, that it &s;eem'd &s;trange, that
except in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and &s;ome Part of <HI>Tartary,</HI> I found
none of the People look <HI>Up</HI> for their Gods, but
<HI>Down;</HI> by which it came into my Mind, that even
in Idolatry it&s;elf, the World was &s;omething dege|nerated,
and their Rea&s;on was more hoodwink'd
than their Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>By looking up, and looking down, I mean, they
do not as the <HI>Romans,</HI> look up among the Stars
for their Idols, place their Gods in the Skies, and
wor&s;hip, as we might &s;ay, like Men; but look
down among the Brutes, form Idols to them|&s;elves
out of the Bea&s;ts, and figure things like
<PB N="144" REF="160">
Mon&s;ters, to adore them for their Ugline&s;s and
horrible Deformity.</P>
<P>Of the Two, the former, in my Opinion, was
much the more rational Idolatry, as particularly&punc;
the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> wor&s;hipping the Sun; and when I had
a particular Account of that at <HI>Bengale,</HI> it pre&s;ent|ly
occur'd to my Thought, that there was &s;ome|thing
awful, &s;omething glorious&punc; and: <HI>God-like</HI> in
the Sun, that, in the Ignorance of the True God,
might rationally be&s;peak the Homage of the Crea|tures;
and to whom it &s;eem'd rea&s;onable&punc; <HI>where
Rea&s;on was its own Judge only, without the Helps of
Revelation,</HI> to pay an Adoration; as the Parent of
Light, and the Giver of Life to all the Vegetative
World, and as in a vi&s;ible Manner, enlivening and
influencing the rational and &s;en&s;itive Life, and
which might, for ought they knew, at fir&s;t create,
as it did &s;ince, &s;o plainly affect all things round

<P>Certain it is, that the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> who thus paid
their Adoration to the Sun, were at that Time
&s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t People in the World. Some
tell us, that the great Image that <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>
&s;et up for all his People to wor&s;hip, was repre|&s;ented
holding the Sun in his Right-hand; and
that it was to the Repre&s;entation of the Sun that
he commanded all Nations and Kindreds to bow
and to wor&s;hip: If &s;o, then the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> were Wor|&s;hippers
al&s;o of the Sun, as well as the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI>
which is not at all improbable; we read al&s;o in
the Scripture, of tho&s;e Nations who wor&s;hipped
all the Ho&s;t of Heaven, a Thing much more ra|tional,

<P>But what are all the Ab&s;urdities of Heatheni&s;m,
which at la&s;t are re&s;olv'd into the Degeneracy of

<P>How many Self-contradicting Principles do they

others their Devotion? How blindly &s;u|per&s;titious?
How furious and raging in their
Zeal? How cruel, inexorable, and even inhuman
and barbarous to one another, when they differ?
as if Religion dive&s;ted us of Humanity, and that
in our wor&s;hipping a God of Mercy, and in
who&s;e Compa&s;&s;ions alone it is that we have room
to hope, we &s;hould to plea&s;e and &s;erve him, ba|ni&s;h
Humanity from our Nature, and &s;hew no
Compa&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e that fall into our Hands.</P>
<P>In my Travelling thro' <HI>Portugal,</HI> it was my Lot to
come to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> while they held there one of their
<PB N="148" REF="164">
Courts of Ju&s;tice, call'd <HI>Auto de fe,</HI> that is to &s;ay
a Court of Ju&s;tice of the Inqui&s;ition: It is a Sub|ject
has been handled by many Writers, and indeed
expos'd by &s;ome of the be&s;t Catholicks; and my
pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s is not to write a Hi&s;tory, or en|gage
in a Di&s;pute, but to relate a Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>They carry'd in Proce&s;&s;ion all their Criminals
to the great Church; where eight of them ap|pear'd
fir&s;t, dre&s;s'd up in Gowns and Caps of Can|va&s;s,
upon which was painted all that Man could
devi&s;e, of Hell's Torments, Devils broiling and
roa&s;ting human Bodies, and a thou&s;and &s;uch fright|ful
things, with Flames and Devils be&s;ides in eve|ry
Part of the Dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e I found were eight poor Creatures con|demn'd
to be burnt, and for they &s;carce knew what;
but for Crimes again&s;t the Catholick Faith, and
again&s;t the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and they were burnt.
One of them, it was &s;aid, rejoic'd that he was to
be burnt; and being ask'd, Why? An&s;wer'd, That
he had much rather die, than be carry'd back to
the Pri&s;on of the Inqui&s;ition, where their Cruel|ties
were wor&s;e than Death: Of tho&s;e eight, as I
was told, &s;ome were Jews, who&s;e greate&s;t Crime,
as many there did not &s;cruple to &s;ay, was, that
they were very rich; and &s;ome Chri&s;tians were in
the Number at the &s;ame Time, who&s;e greate&s;t
Mi&s;ery was, that they were very poor.</P>
<P>It was a Sight that almo&s;t gave me a Shock in
my N$tion of Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf, till I began to re|collect,
that it might be po&s;&s;ible, that Inqui&s;itors
were &s;carce Chri&s;tians, and that <HI>I knew</HI> many Ca|tholic
Countries do not &s;uffer this abominable Judi|cature
to be erected among them.</P>
<P>I have &s;een much, and read more, of the unhap|py
Conduct in Matters or Religion, among the
other Nations of the World, profe&s;&s;ing the Chri|&s;tian
<PB N="149" REF="165">
Religion; and upon my Word, I find &s;ome
Practices infinitely &s;candalous, &s;ome which are the
common receiv'd Cu&s;toms of Chri&s;tians, which
would be the Abhorrence of Heathens; and it re|quires
a &s;trong Attachment to the Foundation,
which is indeed the principal Part in Religion, to
guard our Minds again&s;t being offended, even at
the Chri&s;tian Religion it&s;elf; but I got over that
Part afterward.</P>
<P>Let it not offend the Ears of any true Lover of
the Chri&s;tian Religion, that I ob&s;erve &s;ome of the
Follies of the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Chri&s;tian Religion,
a&s;&s;uring you, 'tis far from being my De&s;ign to bring
the lea&s;t Scandal upon the Profe&s;&s;ion it&s;elf.</P>
<P>And here therefore let me give the Words of
a judicious Per&s;on who travell'd from <HI>Turkey</HI> thro'
<HI>Italy:</HI> His Words are the&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;When I was in <HI>Italy,</HI> I rang'd over great Part
of the Patrimony of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> where one would
think indeed, the Face of Religion would be
plaine&s;t to be &s;een, and without any Di&s;gui&s;e;
but in &s;hort I found there the Face of Reli|gion,
and no more.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;At <HI>Rome</HI> there was all the Pomp and Glory
of religious Habits: The Pope and the Cardi|nals
walk'd with a religious Gravity, but liv'd
in a religious Luxury, kept up the Pomp of Re|ligion,
and the Dignity of religious Titles:
But like our Lord's Ob&s;ervation on the <HI>Phari|&s;ees,</HI>
I found within they were all ravening
Wolves.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The religious Ju&s;tice they do there, is par|cularly
remarkable, and very much recommends
them. The Church protects Murthers and A&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ins,
and then delivers the Civil Magi&s;trates
over to Satan, for doing Ju&s;tice. They inter|dict
whole Kingdoms, and &s;hut up the Churches
<PB N="150" REF="166">
for Want of paying a few Eccle&s;ia&s;tic Dues,
and &s;o put a Stop to Religion for Want of their
Money. I found the <HI>Courtezans</HI> were the mo&s;t
con&s;tant Creatures at the Church, and the mo&s;t
certain Place for an A&s;&s;ignation with another
Man's Wife, was at Prayers.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Court of Inqui&s;ition burnt two Men for
&s;peaking di&s;honourably of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin,
and the Mi&s;&s;ionaries in <HI>China</HI> tolerated the Wor|&s;hipping
the Devil by their new Convert. A
Jew was likewi&s;e burnt for denying Chri&s;t, while
the Je&s;uits join'd the Pagani&s;m of the Heathen
with the High Ma&s;s, and &s;ung Anthems to
the immortal Idols of <HI>Tonquin.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;When I &s;aw this, I re&s;olv'd to enquire no more
after <HI>Religion</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> till by Accident meeting
with a Quieti&s;t, he gave me to under&s;tand, that
all Religion was internal, that the Duties of
Chri&s;tianity were &s;umm'd up in Reflection
and Ejaculation, He inveigh'd bitterly again&s;t
the Game of Religion, which he &s;aid was
playing over the whole World by the Clergy;
and &s;aid, <HI>Italy</HI> was a Theatre, where Religion
was the Grand <HI>Opera,</HI> and the Popi&s;h Clergy
were the Stage Players. I lik'd him in many
of his Notions about other Peoples Religion;
but when I came to talk with him a little clo&s;e|ly
about <HI>his own,</HI> it was &s;o wrapp'd up in his
Internals, conceal'd in the Cavities and dark
Parts of the Soul, <HI>viz.</HI> Meditation without
Wor&s;hip, Doctrine without Practice, Reflecti|on
without Reformation, and Zeal with|out
Knowledge; that I could come to no
Certainty with him, but in this, that Religion
in <HI>Italy</HI> was really <HI>invi&s;ible.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>This was very agreeable to my Notions of <HI>Ita|lian</HI>
Religion, and to what I had met with from
<PB N="151" REF="167">
other People that had travel'd the Country: But
one Ob&s;ervation of Blindne&s;s and Super&s;tition I
mu&s;t give within my own Knowledge, and nearer
Home; when pa&s;&s;ing thro' <HI>Flanders,</HI> I found the
People in a certain City there, in a very
great Commotion: The Ca&s;e was this; A certain
<HI>Scelerate,</HI> &s;o they call an abandon'd Wretch given
up to all Wickedne&s;s, had broken into a Chapel
in the City, and had &s;toln the Pix or Casket where|in
the &s;acred Ho&s;t was depo&s;ited; which Ho&s;t, af|ter
rightly con&s;ecrated, they believe to be the real
Body of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, being tran&s;ub&s;tantiat|ed,
as they call it, from the Sub&s;tance of Bread.</P>
<P>The Fact being di&s;cover'd, the City, as I &s;aid
above, was all up in a Tumult; the Gates were
&s;hut up, no Body &s;uffer'd to go out; every Hou&s;e
was &s;earched, and the utmo&s;t Diligence u&s;ed; and
at length, as it was next to Impo&s;&s;ibility he &s;hould
e&s;cape, he was di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>His Execution was not long deferr'd: But fir&s;t
he was examin'd, and I think by Torture, What
he had done with the &s;acred thing which was in
the Pix, which he had &s;toln? And at length he
confe&s;s'd, That he had thrown it into a Hou&s;e
of Office; and was carry'd with a Guard to &s;hew
them the Place.</P>
<P>As it was impo&s;&s;ible to find a little Piece of a
Wafer in &s;uch a Place, tho' no Pains was &s;par'd in
a mo&s;t filthy Manner to &s;earch for it; but, as I &s;ay,
it could not be found, immediately the Place was
judg'd con&s;ecrated <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> turn'd into an Orato|ry,
and the devout People flock'd to it, to expiate
by their Prayers, the Di&s;honour done to the Lord
God, by throwing his precious Body into &s;o vile a
Place. It was determin'd by the Wi&s;er part, that the
Body would not fall down into the Place, but be
&s;natch'd up by its inherent Power, or by the holy
<PB N="152" REF="168">
Angels, and not be &s;uffer'd to touch the Excre|ments
in that Place. However, the People conti|nu'd
their Devotions for &s;ome Time, ju&s;t in the
Place where it was, and afterwards a large Cha|pel
was built upon it, where the &s;ame Prayers are
continued, as I &s;uppo&s;e, to this Day.</P>
<P>I had a particular Occasion to come at a very
accurate Account of <HI>Poland,</HI> by a <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Gentle|man,
in who&s;e Company I travell'd, and from
whom I learn'd all that was worth enquiring of,
about religious Affairs in <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> on one Side, and
<HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> on the other.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Poland,</HI> he told me they were all Confu|&s;ion,
both in Church and in State; that notwith|&s;tanding
their Wars, they were Per&s;ecutors of the
wor&s;t Kind; that they let the Jews live among 'em
undi&s;turb'd, to &s;uch a Degree, that in the Coun|try
about <HI>L$mberg</HI> and <HI>Kiow,</HI> there were reckon'd
above 30000 Jews: That the&s;e had not Tolera|tion
only, but many Privileges granted them, tho'
they deny'd Chri&s;t to be the Me&s;&s;iah, or that the
Me&s;&s;iah was come in the Fle&s;h; and bla&s;phemed
his Name upon frequent Occa&s;ions; and at the
&s;ame Time they per&s;ecuted the Prote&s;tants, and
de&s;troy'd their Churches, where-ever they had
Power to do it.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, when I came to enquire of
tho&s;e Prote&s;tants, and what Kind of People they
were, who &s;uffer'd &s;o &s;everely for their Religion, I
found they were generally a Sort of Prote&s;tants,
call'd <HI>Socinians,</HI> and that <HI>Lelius Socinus</HI> had &s;pread
his Errors &s;o universally over this Country, that our
Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t was reduc'd here to little more
than a good Man &s;ent from Heaven to in&s;truct the
World, and far from capable of effecting by the In|fluence
of his Spirit, and Grace, the glorious
Work of redeeming the World; As for the
<PB N="153" REF="169">
Divinity of the Holy Gho&s;t, they have no Trou|ble
about it.</P>
<P>Having given this Account of Knowledge
and Piety in the Countries inhabited by Chri&s;tians
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, it &s;eems natural to &s;ay &s;ome
thing of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church.</P>
<P>There are in the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>'s Dominions
abundance of Wooden Churches; and had not
the Country been as full of Wooden Prie&s;ts,
&s;omething might have been &s;aid for the Reli|gion
of the <HI>Mu&s;covites;</HI> for the People are won|derfully
devout there, which would have been ve|ry
well, if it had not been attended with the pro|founde&s;t
Ignorance that was ever heard of in any
Country, where the Name of Chri&s;tian was &s;o
much as talk'd of.</P>
<P>But when I came to enquire about their Wor|&s;hip,
I found our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t made &s;o much
a meaner Figure among them than St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI>
that I concluded Religion was &s;wallow'd up of
Super&s;tition; and &s;o indeed I found it was upon all
Occa&s;ions; as to the Conduct of the People in re|ligious
Matters, their Ignorance is &s;o e&s;tabli&s;h'd
upon Ob&s;tinacy, <HI>which is the</HI> Mu&s;covite'<HI>s national
Sin,</HI> that it would be really to no Purpo&s;e to look
any longer for a Reformation among them.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, no Man will, I believe, &s;ay of me,
that I do the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> any Wrong, when I &s;ay
they are the mo&s;t ignorant, and mo&s;t ob&s;tinate
People in the Chri&s;tian World, when I tell the
following Story of them.</P>
<P>It was after the Battle at <HI>Narva,</HI> where the
late King of <HI>Sweden Charles</HI> XII. defeated their great
Army, and after the Victory, extended his Troops
pretty far into their Country, and perhaps plun|der'd
them a little, as he advanc'd; when the
<HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> we may be &s;ure, being in the utmo&s;t
<PB N="154" REF="170">
Di&s;tre&s;s and Confu&s;ion, fell to their Prayers. We
read of nothing they had to &s;ay to God Almigh|ty
in that Ca&s;e; but to their Patron Saint they
addre&s;s'd this extraordinary Prayer.</P>
<P>O Thou our perpetual Comforter in all our Adver&s;i|ties!
Thou infinitely Powerful St. <HI>NICHOLAS,</HI>
by what Sin, and how have we highly offended thee in
our Sacrifices, Genuflections, Reverences and Actions
of Than&s;giving, that thou ha&s;t thus for&s;aken us? we
had therefore &s;ought to appea&s;e thee entirely, and we had
implor'd thy Pre&s;ence and thy Succour again&s;t the Terri|ble,
In&s;olent, Dreadful, Enrag'd, and Undaunted
Enemies and De&s;troyers; when like Lyons, Bears,
and other Savage Bea&s;ts, that have lo&s;t their young
ones, they attack'd us after an in&s;olent and terri|ble
Manner; and terrify'd and wounded, took and killed
us by thou&s;ands, us who are thy People: Now as it
is impo&s;&s;ible that this &s;hould happen without Witchcraft,
and Enchantment, &s;eeing the great Care that we had
taken to fortify our &s;elves after an impregnable Man|ner,
for the Defence and Security of thy Name. We
be&s;eech thee, O St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> to be our Champion,
and the Bearer of our Standard, to be with us, both
in Peace and in War, and in our Nece&s;&s;ities, and at
the Time of our Death to protect us again&s;t this horrible
and Tyrannical Crew of Sorcerers, and to drive them
far enough off from our Frontiers, with the Recompence
which they de&s;erve.</P>
<P>It may be hoped I may give a better Account
of Religion among Prote&s;tants than I have among
the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Grecian</HI> Churches; and I will, if in
Ju&s;tice it is po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The next to the Nations I have been mention|ing,
I mean, in Geographical Order, are tho&s;e
reform'd Chri&s;tians, call'd <HI>Lutherans;</HI> to &s;ay
<PB N="155" REF="171">
no wor&s;e of them, the Face of Religion indeed is
alter'd much between the&s;e and the latter: But I
&s;carce know what Name to give it, at lea&s;t as far
as I have enquir'd into it, or what it is like.</P>
<P>It was <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>no Popery;</HI> there was the <HI>Con|&s;ub.</HI>
but not the <HI>Tran&s;ub.</HI> The Service differ'd
indeed from <HI>the Ma&s;s,</HI> but the Deficiency &s;eem'd
to be made up very much with the Trumpets, Ket|tle-Drums,
Fiddles, Hautboys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all the
<HI>merry Part</HI> of the Popi&s;h Devotion; upon which it
occurr'd to me pre&s;ently, that if there was no
Danger <HI>of Popery</HI> among the <HI>Lutherans,</HI> there was
Danger of <HI>Super&s;tition;</HI> and as for the pious Part, I
&s;aw very little of it in either of them.</P>
<P>By <HI>Religion</HI> therefore, the Reader is de&s;ired to un|der&s;tand
here, not the Principles upon which the
&s;everal Nations denominate them&s;elves &s;o much,
as the Manner in which they di&s;cover them&s;elves
to be &s;incere in the Profe&s;&s;ion which they make.
I had no Inclination here to enter into the Enquiry
after the Creeds, which every Nation profe&s;s'd to
believe; but the Manner in which they practi&s;ed
that Religion which they really profe&s;s'd; for,
What is Religion to me without Practice? And
altho' it may be true, that there can be no true
Religion, where it is not profe&s;s'd upon right
Principles; yet that which I ob&s;erve here, and
which to me is the greate&s;t Grievance among
Chri&s;tians, is the Want of a religious Practice,
even where there are right Principles at Bottom,
and where there is a Profe&s;&s;ion of the Orthodox
Faith.</P>
<P>In Brief, I am not hunting after the Profe&s;&s;ion
of Religion, but the Practice: The fir&s;t I find
almo&s;t in every Nation, <HI>Nulla gens tam barbara</HI>&mdash;But
the la&s;t I am like to travel thro' the Hi&s;tories
of all Chri&s;tendom <HI>with my Search,</HI> and per|haps
<PB N="156" REF="172">
may hardly be able, when I have done, to
tell you where it is.</P>
<P>All the Satyr of this Enquiry will look this
Way; for where God has not given a People
the Ble&s;&s;ing of a true Knowledge of him&s;elf, it
would call for our Pity, not Reproach. It
would be a very dull Satyr indeed, that a Man
&s;hould be witty upon the Negroes in <HI>Africa</HI> for
not knowing Chri&s;t. and not under&s;tanding the
Doctrine of a Saviour: But if turning to our
modern Chri&s;tians of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and <HI>Jamaica</HI> for
not teaching them, not in&s;tructing them, and
for refusing to baptize them; there the Satyr
would be pointed and &s;ea&s;onable, as we &s;hall hear
farther by and by.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Lutherans,</HI> for there I am
&s;uppo&s;ed to be at this Time, I mean, among
the Courts and Cities of <HI>Brandenburgh, Saxo|ny,
&amp;c.</HI> I had Opportunity here to view a Court,
affecting Gallantry, Magnificence, and gay things,
to &s;uch a Height, and with &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion, to ex|ceed
the whole World in that empty Part of hu|man
Felicity, call'd <HI>Show,</HI> that I thought it was
impo&s;&s;ible to pur&s;ue it with &s;uch an impetuous
Torrent of the Affections, without &s;acrificing all
things to it, which wi&s;e Men e&s;teem more va|luable.</P>
<P>Nor was my Notion wrong; for the fir&s;t thing
I found &s;acrific'd, as I &s;ay, to this voluptuous
Humour, was the Liberties of the People, who
being by Con&s;titution or Cu&s;tom, rather under ab|&s;olute
Government, and at the arbitrary Will
of the Prince, are &s;ure to pay, not all they can
&s;pare, but even all they have, to gratify the un|bounded
Appetite of a Court given up to Plea|&s;ure
and Exorbitance.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="173">
By all I have read of the Manner of Living
there, both Court and People; the latter are
entirely given up to the former; not by Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
only, but by the Con&s;ent of Cu&s;tom, and
the general Way of Management thro' the whole
Country; nay, this is carry'd to &s;$ch a Height,
that as I have been told, the King's Coffers are
the general Ce&s;s-Pool of the Nations, whither all
the Money of the Kingdoms flow, and only di&s;|per&s;es
again, as that gives it out; whether by
running over or running out at its proper Vent,
I do not enquire; &s;o that as all the Blood in the
human Body circulates in 24 Ho$rs thro' the
Ventricles of the Heart, &s;o all the Money in the
Kingdom is &s;aid to pa&s;s once a Year thro' the
King's Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>How far Poverty and Mi&s;ery may prompt
Piety and Devotion among the poor Inhabi|tants,
I cannot &s;ay: But if Luxury and Gallan|try,
together with Tyranny and Oppre&s;&s;ion to
&s;upport it, can &s;ub&s;i&s;t with true Religion in the
great Men, than for ought I know, the Courts of
<HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Dre&s;den</HI> may be the be&s;t qualify'd in the
World to produce this Thing call'd Religion,
which I have hitherto &s;een, is hard to be found.</P>
<P>It is true, that the Magnificence of the wi&s;e&s;t
King in the World in <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> was e&s;teemed
the Felicity of his People: B$t it &s;eems to be ex|pre&s;s'd
very elegantly, not as a Te&s;timony of
his Glory only, but of the flouri&s;hing Condition
of his People at the &s;ame Time, under the pros|perous
Circumstances which his Reign brought
them to, <HI>viz.</HI> That he made Gold to be for Plen|ty
like the Stones in the Streets, amply expre&s;&s;ing
the flo$ri&s;hing Condition of his People under
him.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="174">
I have likewise read indeed, and heard much of
the &s;ame Kind of the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and that
even from his own Subjects, who were always full
of the generous and truly royal Qualities of that
Prince: He was the fir&s;t King of the Country,
which before was a Dukedom or Electorate only:
The Summ of their Di&s;cour&s;e is, That his Maje|&s;ty
was &s;o true a Father of his Country and of his
People, that his whole care was the Flouri&s;hing
of their Trade, e&s;tabli&s;hing their Manufactures,
encrea&s;ing their Numbers, planting Foreigners,
<HI>French, Swi&s;s,</HI> and other Nations, among them,
to in&s;truct and encourage them; and being noway
acce&s;&s;ory to any of their Oppre&s;&s;ions, but relieving
and redre&s;&s;ing all their Grievances, as often and
as &s;oon as they came to his Knowledge:
And indeed, I could not but entertain a great
Regard to the Character of &s;o ju&s;t and good a
Prince. But all I could infer from that was, That
a Government may be tyrannical, and yet the
King not be a Tyrant; but the Grievances to the
People are oftentimes much the &s;ame: And every
Admini&s;tration, where the Con&s;titution is thus
&s;tated, as it &s;eems to be in mo&s;t, if not all of the
Northern Courts, Prote&s;tant as well as others,
&s;eems incon&s;i&s;tent with the true Ends of Govern|ment;
the thing we call Government was certain|ly
e&s;tabli&s;hed for the Pro&s;perity of the People;
Whereas; on the contrary, in all tho&s;e <HI>German</HI>
Courts, where I have made my Ob&s;ervations, the
Magnificence of the Court, and the Pro&s;perity of
the People, &s;tand like the two Poles; what Ex|ce&s;s
of Light you &s;ee at one, is exactly balanced by
&s;o much Dark$e&s;s at t'other.</P>
<P>And where, pray, is the Religion of all this?
That a whole Nation of People &s;hould appear
mi&s;erable, that their Governours may appear gay,
<PB N="159" REF="175">
the People &s;tarve, that the Prince may be fed;
or rather, the People be lean, that their Sovereign
may be fat; the Subjects &s;igh, that he may laugh;
be empty, that he may be full; and all this for
meer Luxury, not for the needful Defence of the
Government, re&s;i&s;ting Enemies, preserving the
public Peace, and the like, but for meer Extra|vagance,
Luxury, and Magnificence, as in <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia;</HI>
or for Ambition, and pu&s;hing at Crowns, and the
Lu&s;t of Domination, as in <HI>Saxony.</HI></P>
<P>But to come back to the religious Tran&s;actions
of the&s;e Countries, How are the Eccle&s;ia&s;tics
jealous of their Hierarchy, afraid to reform far|ther,
lea&s;t, as they gave a mortal Stabb to the
Perqui&s;ites and Vails of God Almighty's Ser|vice
in the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, modern Reformation
might give the like to them? For this Rea&s;on
they &s;et a Pale about their Church, and there,
as well as in other Places, they cry to their
Neighbours, <HI>Stand off, I am holier than thou;</HI> and
with what Per&s;ecution and Inva&s;ion, per&s;ecuting
for Religion, and invading the Principles of one
another. If there was any Peace among them,
it was that only which <HI>pa&s;&s;es all Under&s;tanding.</HI> It
pre&s;ently occurr'd to me, what Charity can here
be, where there is no Peace? And what Religion,
where is no Charity? And I began to fear I &s;hould
find little of what I look'd for in tho&s;e odd Cli|mates.</P>
<P>I had travell'd per&s;onally thro' the Heart of
<HI>France,</HI> where I had Occa&s;ion to look round me
often enough in my Rout from the Foot of the
<HI>Pyrenean</HI> Mountains to <HI>Thoulou&s;e,</HI> from thence to
<HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Calais.</HI> Here I found the People &s;o mer|ry,
and yet &s;o mi&s;erable, that I knew not where to
make any Judgment. The Poverty of the Poor
was &s;o great, that it &s;eem'd to leave them no
<PB N="160" REF="176">
room to &s;igh for any thing, but their Burthens, or
to pray for any thing, but Bread: But the Tem|per
of the People was &s;o volatile, that I thought,
they went always dancing to Church, and came
&s;inging out of it.</P>
<P>I found a World of Teachers here, but no body
taught: The Streets were every where full of
Prie&s;ts, and the Churches full of Women, But as
for Religion, I found mo&s;t of the Clergy were &s;o far
from having much of it, that few of them knew
what it was. Never &s;ure was a Nation &s;o full of
truly <HI>blind Guides;</HI> for nothing can be more gro&s;s|ly
ignorant of Religion, than many of their Cler|gy
are; nothing more void of Morals, than many
of tho&s;e to whom other People go to confe&s;s their
Sins.</P>
<P>I made &s;ome Enquiry about Religion; and a|mong
the re&s;t, I happen'd to fall in Company with
a good hone&s;t Hugonot <HI>incognito;</HI> and he told me
very hone&s;tly, that the State of Religion in <HI>France</HI>
&s;tood thus: Fir&s;t, That for &s;ome Years ago it was
put to the Te&s;t by the King, and that was, when
the Edicts came out to bani&s;h and ruin the Hugo|nots;
at which Time, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> we thought there
had been a great deal of Religion in it: But really
when it came to the Pu&s;h, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> it was hard to
tell where we &s;hould find it. The Per&s;ecution, as
it was thought at fir&s;t, would be ingrateful to the
more religious Roman-Catholicks, and that &s;ome
would be found too good to do the Drudgery of
the Devil: But we were mi&s;taken, the be&s;t fell
in with Per&s;ecution, when it was done by other
Hands, and not their own; and tho&s;e that would
not do it, acknowledg'd they rejoic'd that it was
done; which &s;hew'd, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> that the Catholicks
<PB N="161" REF="177">
either had no Principle, or acted again&s;t Principle,
which is much at one. And as for us Hugonots,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> we have &s;hewn that we have no Religion
lo&s;t among us: For fir&s;t, &s;ome run away for their Re|ligion,
and yet left it behind them, and we that &s;tay'd
behind did it at the Price of our Principles: For now,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> we are meer Hypocrites, neither Papi&s;ts nor
Hugonots, for we go to Ma&s;s with Prote&s;tant
Hearts; and while we call our &s;elves Prote&s;tants,
we bow in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Rimmon,</HI> Where then, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI>
is the Religion, once boa&s;ted of here, to be found?
Indeed, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> it is hard to tell you, and except a
little that is in the Galleys, I can give you no good
Account of it. This indeed was confining the
Remains of a flouri&s;hing Church to about 350
Confe&s;&s;ors, who really &s;uffer'd Martyrdom for it,
for it was no le&s;s; &s;o I minuted down <HI>French</HI> Reli|gion,
tugging at the Oar, and would have come
away.</P>
<P>But it came into my Thought to ask him, What
he meant by telling me, that tho&s;e who run away
for their Religion out of <HI>France,</HI> left mo&s;t of it
behind them? He an&s;wer'd, I &s;hould judge of it
better, if I ob&s;erv'd them when I came into my
own Country; where, if I found they liv'd better
than other People, or &s;hew'd any thing of Reli|gion
&s;uitable to a People that &s;uffer'd Per&s;ecution
for their Profe&s;&s;ion, I &s;hould &s;end Word of it; for
he had heard quite otherwi&s;e of them, which
was the Rea&s;on why he and Thou&s;ands of others
did not follow them.</P>
<P>It happen'd, while I was warm in my Enqui|ries
thus after Religion, a Proclamation came
out in <HI>London,</HI> for appointing a General Thank&s;|giving,
for a great Victory obtain'd by the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Forces and their Confederates, over the <HI>French</HI>
at&mdash;I care not to put Names to the parti|cular
Times of things.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="178">
I &s;tarted at the Noi&s;e, when they cry'd it in the
Streets: Hah, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> then I have found it at la&s;t;
and I rejoyc'd in particular, that having look'd &s;o
much abroad for Religion, I &s;hould find it out
at home: Then I began to call my&s;elf a thou&s;and
Fools, that I had not &s;av'd my&s;elf all this Labour,
and look'd at home fir&s;t; tho' by the By, I had
done no more in this than other Travellers often,
or indeed generally do, <HI>viz.</HI> go abroad to &s;ee the
World, and &s;earch into the Curio&s;ities of foreign
Countries, and know nothing of their own.</P>
<P>But to return to my Observations: I was re|&s;olv'd
to &s;ee the Ceremonies of this pious Piece of
Work; and as the Preparations for it were prodi|gious
great, I enquir'd how it would be; but no
body could remember that the like had ever been
in their Time before: Every one &s;aid, it would
be very fine, that the Queen would be there her
&s;elf, and all the Nobility; and that the like had
never been &s;een &s;ince Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time.</P>
<P>This plea&s;ed me exceedingly; and I began to
form Ideas in my Mind, of what had been in for|mer
Times among religious Nations; I could
find nothing of what I was made to expect, unle&s;s
it was <HI>Solomen</HI>'s Dedication of the Temple, or <HI>Jo|&s;iah</HI>'s
Great Fea&s;t of the Reformation; and I ex|pected
God would have a mo&s;t royal Tribute of
Prai&s;e.</P>
<P>But it &s;hock'd me a little, that the People &s;aid
there had never been &s;uch a Than&s;giving &s;ince
Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time. What thought I can be
the Rea&s;on of that? and mu&s;ing a little, O! &s;ays I
to my&s;elf, now I have found it: I &s;uppo&s;e, no bo|dy
gives God Thanks in our Country, but Queens:
But this look'd a little har&s;h; and I rumag'd our
Hi&s;tories a little for my farther Satisfaction, but
could make nothing of it: At la&s;t, talking of it
<PB N="163" REF="179">
to a good old Cavalier, that had been a Soldier
for King <HI>Charles,</HI> O, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I can tell you the
Rea&s;on of it: They have never given Thanks, <HI>&s;ays
he,</HI> becau&s;e they have had nothing to give Thanks
for. Pray, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> When have they had any Vi|ctories
in <HI>England</HI> &s;ince Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Time,
except two or three in <HI>Ireland</HI> in King <HI>William</HI>'s
Time; and then they were &s;o bu&s;y, had &s;o many
other Lo&s;&s;es with them abroad, that they were
a&s;ham'd to give Thanks for them.</P>
<P>This I found had too much Truth in it, howe|ver
bitter the Je&s;t of it: But &s;till heighten'd my
Expectation, and made me look for &s;ome &s;trange
Seriou&s;ne&s;s, and religious Thank&s;fulne&s;s in the Ap|pearance
that was to be on the Occa&s;ion in Hand;
and accordingly I &s;ecur'd my&s;elf a Place, both
without and within the Church, where I might be
a Witne&s;s to every Part of the Devotionand Joy
People.</P>
<P>But my Expectations were wound up to a yet grea|ter
Pitch, when I &s;aw the infinite Crowds of Peo|ple
throng with &s;o much Zeal, <HI>as I, like a charitable
C$$comb, thought it to be,</HI> to the Place of the Wor&s;hip
of God; and when I con&s;idered, that it was to give
God Thanks for a great Victory, I could think of
nothing el&s;e than the Joy of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> when
they landed on the Banks of the Sea, and &s;aw <HI>Pha|$$$</HI>'s
Army, Hor&s;es, and Chariots, &s;wallow'd up
behind them; and I doubted not I &s;hould hear
&s;omething like the Song of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the Chil|dren
of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> on the Occa&s;ion, and &s;hould hear it
$word$ with the &s;ame Elevation of Soul.</P>
<P>But when I came to the Point, the fir&s;t thing I
ob&s;erv'd was, That nine Parts of ten of all the
Company, came there only to &s;ee the Queen, and
the Show, and the other tenth Part, I think, might
be &s;aid to make the Show.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="180">
When the Queen came to the Rails, and de|&s;cended
from her Coach, the People, in&s;tead of
crying out <HI>Ho&s;$$nah,</HI> ble&s;&s;ed be the Queen that
cometh in the Name of the Lord; I &s;ay, the Peo|ple
cry'd Murder, and Help, for God's &s;ake,
treading upon one another, and &s;tifling one ano|ther,
at &s;uch a rate, that in the Rear of the two
Lines or Crowds of People, thro' which the Queen
Pa&s;s'd, it look'd &s;omething like a Battle, whe$$
the wound$$ were retir'd to die, and to get Sur|g$ons
to come to them, for there lay Heaps of
Women and Children dragg'd from among the
Fe$$ of the Crowd, and ga&s;ping for Breath. I
went among &s;ome of them, and ask'd them, What
made them go into &s;uch a Crowd? And their An|&s;wer
was all the &s;ame, O Sir, I had a Mind to &s;ee
the Queen, as the re&s;t did.</P>
<P>Well, I had my An&s;wer here indeed; for in
&s;hort, the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Thank&s;giving
without Doors, was to &s;ee the Queen, that was
plain; &s;o I went away to my Stand, which, for
no le&s;s than three Guineas, I had &s;ecur'd in the
Church.</P>
<P>When I came there, it was my Fate to be pla|ced
between the Seats, where the Men of God
reform'd the Service of his Prai&s;e, and &s;ung out
the Anthems and the <HI>Te Deum,</HI> which celebrated
the religious Triumph of the Day.</P>
<P>As to the Men them&s;elves, I lik'd their $word$,
their Ve&s;t$$ents, and their Appearance; all look'd
awful and grave enough, &s;uitable in &s;ome Re&s;pects
to the Solemnity of a religious Triumph; and I
expected they would be as &s;olemn in their Perfor|mances,
as the <HI>Levites</HI> that blow'd the Trumpets
$t <HI>Solemen</HI>'s Fea&s;t, when all the People &s;houted and
prai&s;ed God.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="181">
But I ob&s;erved the&s;e grave People, in the In|tervals
of their wor&s;hipping God, when it was
not their Turn to &s;ing, or read, or pray, be&s;tow'd
&s;ome of the re&s;t of their Time in taking Snuff, ad|ju&s;ting
their Perukes, looking about at the fair La|dies,
whi&s;pering, and that not very &s;oftly neither
to one another, about this fine Lady, that pretty
Woman, this fine Dutche&s;s, and that great For|tune,
and not without &s;ome Indecencies, as well
of Words, as of Ge&s;tures. Well, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you are
none of the People I look for, where are they that
give God Thanks?</P>
<P>Immediately the Organ &s;truck up for the <HI>Te De|um;</HI>
up &s;tarts all my Gentlemen, as if in&s;pir'd from
above, and from their talking together, not over
mode&s;tly, fall to prai&s;ing God with the utmo&s;t Pre|cipitation,
&s;inging the heavenly Anthems, with all
the Grace and Mu&s;ic imaginable.</P>
<P>In the Middle of all this Mu&s;ick and the&s;e exalted
things, when I thought my Soul elevated with di|vine
Melody, and began to be reconcil'd to all the
re&s;t, I &s;aw a little ru&s;tling Motion among the Peo|ple,
as if they had been di&s;turb'd or frighted:
Some &s;aid it thunder'd, &s;ome &s;aid the Church &s;hook.
The true Bu&s;ine&s;s was, the <HI>Te Deum</HI> within was
an&s;wer'd without by the Thunder of 100 Pieces
of Cannon, and the Noi&s;e of Drums, with the
Huzza's and Shouts of great Crowds of People in
the Streets. This I did not under&s;tand, &s;o it did
neither di&s;turb or concern me; I found indeed no
great Harmony in it; it bore no Con&s;ort in the
Mu&s;ic, at lea&s;t, as I under&s;tood it; but it was
over pretty &s;oon, and &s;o we went on.</P>
<P>When the Anthem was &s;ung, and the other Ser|vices
&s;ucceeded them, I that had been a little di|&s;turb'd
with the lucid Intervals of the Chori&s;ters,
and the Gentlemen that &s;at crowded in with
<PB N="166" REF="182">
them, turn'd my Eyes to other Places, in Hopes
I &s;hould find &s;ome Saints among the Crowd, who&s;e
Souls were taken up with the exalted Raptures of
the Day.</P>
<P>But alas, it was all one, the Ladies were bu&s;y
&s;ingling out the Men, and the Men the Ladies.
The Star and Garter of a fine young Nobleman,
beautiful in Per&s;on, rich in Habit, and &s;parkling
in Jewels, his blew Ribbond intimating his Cha|racter,
drew the Eyes of &s;o many Women off of
their Prayer Books, that I think his Grace ought
to have been &s;poken to by the Vergers, to have
withdrawn out of the Church, that he might
not injure the Service, and rob God Almighty of
the Homage of the Day.</P>
<P>As for the Queen, her Maje&s;ty was the Star of
the Day, and infinitely more Eyes were directed
to her than were lifted up to Heaven, tho' the
la&s;t was the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the whole Proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> this is mighty fine, that's true:
But where's the Religion of all this? Heavens
ble&s;s me, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> out of this Crowd, and I'll ne|ver
mock God any more here, when the Queen
comes again. Cannot the&s;e People go and &s;ee the
Queen, where the Queen is to be &s;een, but mu&s;t
they come hither to prophane the Church with
her, and make the Queen an Idol? And in a great
Pa&s;&s;ion I was both at the People and at the Man|ner
of the Day, as you may ea&s;ily &s;ee by what
follows.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> I had made &s;ome other &s;atyrical Reflections
upon the Conduct of the Day; but as it looks
too near home, I am not willing, that poor <HI>Ro|bin&s;on
Cr$&s;$e</HI> &s;hould di&s;oblige any body.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, the Clo&s;e of the Day was &s;till more
extravagant; for there the Thank&s;giving was ad|journed
from the Church to the Tavern, and to
<PB N="167" REF="183">
the Street; and in&s;tead of the Decency of a reli|gious
Triumph, there was indeed a Triumph of
religious indecency, and the Anthems <HI>Te Deum</HI>
and Thank&s;giving of the Day ended in the Drun|kenne&s;s,
the Bonefires, and the Squibs and Crac|kers
of the Street.</P>
<P>How far Religion is concern'd in all this, or
whether God Almighty will accept of this noi&s;y
Doings for Thank&s;givings, that I have nothing
to do with; let tho&s;e People con&s;ider of it, that are
concern'd in it.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>Of Differences in Religion.</HEAD>
<P>_TIS known alone to the Divine Wi&s;dom,
why he has been plea&s;ed to &s;uffer any
Part of Religion, and the Adoration
paid to his Maje&s;ty, the Supplications
made to him, and the Homage which his Crea|tures
owe to his glorious Being, to be &s;o doubt|fully
directed, or &s;o differently under&s;tood by his
Creatures, as that there &s;hould be any Mi&s;takes or
Di&s;agreements about them.</P>
<P>How comes it to pa&s;s, that the paying a Re|verence
to the Name and Being of God, &s;hould
not be as uncapable of being di&s;puted in the Man|ner

of Wor&s;hipping, Believing in, and Serving the Great
God of Heaven and Earth, &s;hould be capable of
being under&s;tood any more than one Way? And that
the Infallible Spirit of God, who is our Guide
<PB N="168" REF="184">
to Heaven, &s;hould leave any one of its Dictates
in a State of being mi&s;under&s;tood?</P>
<P>Why have not the Rules of Religion, as well
tho&s;e of Doctrine as of Life, been laid down in
Terms &s;o plain, and &s;o impo&s;&s;ible to be mi&s;taken,
that all Men in the World in every Age, &s;hould
have the &s;ame Notions of them, and under&s;tand them
in every Title of them exactly alike? Then as Hea|ven
is but one ble&s;&s;ed great Port, at which all Hope
to arrive, there would have been but one Road
to travel the Journey in; all Men would have gone
the &s;ame Way, &s;teer'd the &s;ame Cour&s;e; and
Brethren would no more have fallen out by the
Way.</P>
<P>God alone, who for wi&s;e and righteous Rea|&s;ons,
becau&s;e he can do nothing but what is wi&s;e
and righteous, has otherwi&s;e order'd it, and that
is all we can &s;ay of it: As to the Rea&s;on and Ju|&s;tice
of it, that is a thing, of which, like as of
the Times and of the Sea&s;ons, we may &s;ay, <HI>Know|eth
no Man.</HI></P>
<P>In the State of Uncertainty we are now in, &s;o
it is; two Men believing in the &s;ame God, holding
the &s;ame Faith, the &s;ame Saviour, the &s;ame Do|ctrine,
and aiming at the &s;ame Heaven; yet can|not
agree to go to that Heaven, or wor&s;hip
that God, or believe in that Saviour the &s;ame Way,
or after the &s;ame Manner: Nay, they cannot
know, or conceive of God, or of Heaven, or of the
Redeemer, or indeed of any one Principle of the
Chri&s;tian Religion, in the &s;ame Manner, or form
the &s;ame Ideas of the&s;e things in their Minds.</P>
<P>It is true, the different Capacities and Faculties
of Men, are in Part a Rea&s;on for this; by which
it is occa&s;ioned, that &s;carce two Men together
have the &s;ame Notions and Apprehen&s;ions even of
one and the &s;ame thing, becau&s;e their Under&s;tan|dings
<PB N="169" REF="185">
are led by different Guides, and they &s;ee by
different Lights.</P>
<P>But this is not all; they are not alike hone&s;t to
the Light they have: Three Men read the &s;ame do|ctrinal
Article, &s;ay it be of the Trinity, or of any
other, and they all examine the Foundation of it in
the Scripture. One thinks verily he has found out
the My&s;tery effectually, goes on with his Enquiries,
and brings every Scripture and every Pa&s;&s;age to
corre&s;pond exactly with his fir&s;t Notion; and thus
he confirms him&s;elf immoveably in his Opinion;
and it is &s;o clear to him, that he can not only ne|ver
be argued out of it, but can entertain no good
Opinion of any Man, that conceives of it in any
other Way, but takes him for an Enemy to the
Orthodox Doctrine, and that he merits to be ex|pell'd
out of Chri&s;t's Church, deny'd the Chri&s;tian
Communion; and in &s;hort, treats him with no Re|&s;pect,
no nor thinks of him with Charity.</P>
<P>Another comes to the &s;ame Scripture, and in
que&s;t of the &s;ame Doctrine, and he reads over the
&s;ame Texts, and recieves Motions from them di|rectly
oppo&s;ite to the other, or at lea&s;t, very re|mote
from them: He follows in his Search thro'
all the corroborating Texts, and is confirm'd in
his fir&s;t Opinion from them all: He grows as
immoveable in his receiv'd Con&s;truction of the
Scripture, as the other; and all is &s;o clear to him,
that he not only can never be argued out of his
Opinion, but can entertain no good Opinion of
any Man that conceives of it any other Way,
but takes him for an Enemy to the Orthodox
Doctrine.</P>
<P>The third Man, he reads over all the &s;ame
Texts of Scripture, but doing it with an Indiffe|rency
as to the Sub&s;tance, and whether he re|ceives
right information or no, truly he comes
<PB N="170" REF="186">
way with a Calmne&s;s of Mind as to the Sub&s;tance;
and as he went with no great Concern about being
certain, &s;o he comes back as uncertain as he went.</P>
<P>The&s;e three Men are enough to fill the whole
World full of Di&s;putes about Religion. The fir&s;t
two meet, and being equally po&s;itive of their being
infallibly guided, equally warm in defending their
Opinions, and equally tenacious of them, and above
all equally void of Charity to the other; truly they
fall our, Part, condemn, cen&s;ure, revile, and as Op|portunity
and Power offers, at la&s;t, per&s;ecute
one another, and all one anothers Adherents.</P>
<P>The third, half inform'd indifferent Man, he
comes in between the&s;e two, laughs at them both,
&s;ays they are a Parcel of furious Chri&s;tians, that
the thing is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be known,
that it is no Article of Faith, &s;o as that with|out
deciding it, a Man cannot be &s;av'd; &s;ays,
they are a Parcel of Fools to fall out thus about
what they cannnot be certain of, and which they
may go to Heaven tho' they &s;hould not under&s;tand
it till they come there: And thus the World comes
to be divided.</P>
<P>Could they differ with Humility, they would
differ with Charity; but it is not to be, in Religi|on,
whatever it may be in civil or politick Affairs;
for there is a thing called <HI>Zeal,</HI> which Men call
<HI>a Grace</HI> in Religion, and e&s;teem a Duty; and this
makes Men fall out in religious Matters, with a
more fatal Warmth, and more Animo&s;ity, than in
other Ca&s;es, according to <HI>Hudibra&s;s.</HI></P>
<Q><L>&startq;Zeal makes men fight like mad or drunk,</L>

<P>Nor is this the Fate only of the Chri&s;tian Religi|on,
tho' 'tis more &s;o there than in any other; but 'tis
<PB N="171" REF="187">
the &s;ame in other Ca&s;es, as between the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI>
and the <HI>Turks,</HI> about the Succe&s;&s;ors of their Pro|phet
<HI>Mahomet.</HI> It was &s;o of Old between the
<HI>Heathen</HI> and the <HI>Jews:</HI> And the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Monarch
prepar'd a fiery Furnace for tho&s;e that would not fall
down and wor&s;hip the great Image that he had &s;et
up.</P>
<P>In the Primitive Times of God's Church, the
Heathen did die like by the Chri&s;tians, and <HI>Chri&s;tia|nos
Ad Leones</HI> was the common Cry: But when the
Church came to its Halcyon-Days, <HI>Con&s;tantine the
Great</HI> gave Peace to the Chri&s;tians, and it was but a
little While that they enjoy'd that Peace, before
they fell out by the Way, the Arian Here&s;ies ro&s;e
up, and differing Opinions rent the State into Fa|ctions,
the Church into Schi&s;ms, and in the Space
of two Reigns, the Arians per&s;ecuted the Ortho|dox,
and the Orthodox the Arians, almo&s;t with
the &s;ame Fury as the Heathen had per&s;ecutet$h em
both with before.</P>
<P>From thence to our Time, Per&s;ecution has been
the Practice even of all Parties, as they have been
clothed with Power, and as their Differences have
mov'd them: For Example, in all the Chri&s;tian
Countries, there is a mortal Feud between Popi&s;h
and Prote&s;tant; and tho' indeed the former have
carry'd their Zeal farthe&s;t, yet the latter have not
been able to &s;ay they have not per&s;ecuted in their
Turn, tho' not with Fire and Faggot.</P>
<P>What Wars and Blood&s;hed mole&s;ted <HI>Europe</HI> on
the Account of Religion in <HI>Germany?</HI> e&s;pecially
till the general Pacification of tho&s;e Troubles at
the Treaty of <HI>We&s;tphalia?</HI> when the Prote&s;tants
having had the apparent Advantage of the War,
obtain'd the everla&s;ting Settlement of their Religi|on,
as well as Liberties thro' the whole Empire.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="188">
Since tho&s;e times, what Per&s;ecution in the &s;ame
Country, between the Lutheran and Calvini&s;t
Churches? And how little Charity is among them?
in&s;omuch, that the Lutherans to this Day will not
allow the reformed Evangelick Churches, &s;o the
Calvini&s;ts are call'd, Liberty to a&s;&s;emble for Wor&s;hip
within the Gates of their Cities, or give them
Chri&s;tian Burial.</P>
<P>I avoid looking too near Home, or &s;earching in
<HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England</HI> among the unhappy Divi&s;i|ons
of Epi&s;copal and Presbyterian, Church of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
and Di&s;&s;enter; and this I do, becau&s;e it is at
Home: But it is too evident, that all the&s;e come
either from Mens being negligent of right Informa|tions,
or too tenacious when they have it; for 'tis
evident, if all Men would be hone&s;t to the Light
they have, and favourable to their Neighbours, we
might hope, that how many &s;everal Ways &s;oever,
we cho&s;e to walk towards Heaven, we &s;hould all
meet there at la&s;t.</P>
<P>I look upon all the Seeds of religious Di&s;&s;en|tion,
as Tares &s;ow'd by the Devil among the
Wheat: And it may be ob&s;erved, that tho' as I
have already &s;aid, the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> per&s;ecuted the Jews,
and the <HI>Romans</HI> the Chri&s;tians; yet where the
Devil is immediately and per&s;onally wor&s;hipped,
there we meet with little or no Per&s;ecution; for
Satan having a kind of peaceable Dominion there,
offers them no Di&s;turbance: He de&s;ires no Inno|vation
for ever; he finds the Sweetne&s;s of it, and
lets it all alone.</P>
<P>But if once they talk of <HI>other Gods Before him,</HI>
he is far le&s;s ea&s;y; there he is continually &s;owing
Strife, and hatching Divi&s;ions among them; <HI>for
like all other Menarchs,</HI> the Devil loves to reign
alone.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="189">
It would be too long a Task here, to reckon up
the &s;everal Sorts of Differences in Religion, even
among us in <HI>England;</HI> where, if two happen to
differ, pre&s;ently like St. <HI>Paul</HI> to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> they
<HI>with&s;tand one another to the Face;</HI> that is to &s;ay, car|ry
on the Di&s;pute to the utmo&s;t Extremity.</P>
<P>But there is another Que&s;tion before me, and
that is not only, Why there are &s;uch Differences
in the Points of Religion? And, why are religi|ous
Differences hotter and more irreconcilable
than other Breaches? But, why are there more
Differences of this Kind among us, than among
any other Nation in the World?</P>
<P>Certainly this pu&s;hing on our religious Broils to
the Extremity, is the Peculiar of this Country of
<HI>England,</HI> and is not the &s;ame thing in other Places;
and the Variety is &s;uch here, that 'tis &s;aid, there
are more &s;everal Communions or Communities of
religious Kinds in <HI>England,</HI> than in all the other
Prote&s;tant Countries in the World.</P>
<P>The be&s;t and mo&s;t charitable An&s;wer that I
can think of to give for this, is to compliment
our &s;elves, and &s;ay, 'tis becau&s;e we are the mo&s;t
religious Nation in the World; that is to &s;ay,
that we in general &s;et more &s;eriou&s;ly to work, to
enquire into the Sub&s;tance and Nature of Religion;
to examine Principles, and weigh the Rea&s;ons of
things, than other People; being more concern'd
for, and anxious about, the Affairs of God, of
Heaven, and our Souls; that thinking, as we
ought to do, that Religion is of the utmo&s;t Con|cern
to us, and that it is of the la&s;t Moment to us
to be certain about it, and well grounded in the
Points before us, particularly whether we are rightly
inform'd or not; this anxious Concern makes us jea|lous
of every Opinion and Tenacious of our own,
breaks much in upon the Cu&s;tom of &s;ubmitting
<PB N="174" REF="190">
our Judgments to the Clergy, as is the Ca&s;e in
Countries, where People are more indifferent in
their Search after the&s;e things, and more uncon|cern'd
in the Certainty Or Uncertainty of them.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge, that I think the true
and the only ju&s;t Rea&s;on that can be given for this
Matter, is not, that we are more furious
than other People, more cen&s;orious and ra&s;h in our
Judgment, that we have le&s;s Charity, or le&s;s Pa|tience,
in debating religious Points, than other
People: But the Truth is, that we have le&s;s In|difference
about them; and we cannot &s;it down
contented with a Slight and overly Enquiry, or a
Cur&s;ory or School An&s;wer to the Doubts in Que|&s;tion:
But we make it a Thing of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;i|ty,
to be fully inform'd of, and therefore are ear|ne&s;t
in the Enquiry, and knowing the Scripture
to be the great Rule of Faith, the Standard for
Life and Doctrine, we flie thither and &s;earch for
our &s;elves, not having Popery enough to expect an
infallible Judge, not Indifference enough to acqui|e&s;ce
in the Judgment of the Clergy; and perhaps a
little too tenacious of out own Interpretation,
even in things we are unin&s;tructed about.</P>
<P>This indeed I take to be the true Rea&s;on why
religious Di&s;putes encrea&s;e &s;o much here, and why
there are &s;uch Separations and Schi&s;ms among us,
more than they are in any other Nation in the
World.</P>
<P>I know much of it is laid to the Door of the
Confu&s;ions they were all in here, during the bloody
inte&s;tine Wars in the Years 1640 to 1656, and the
Liberty given to all Opinions to &s;et up them&s;elves
at that Time: But I wave that as a Que&s;tion that
tends to more Divi&s;ion. I believe, the Rea&s;on I
have given for it, &s;tands as well grounded, and as
<PB N="175" REF="191">
likely to be approved as any I can give, or as any
that has been given in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>There is another difficult Que&s;tion, which &s;till
remains before us; and that is, What Remedy
can we apply to this Malady? And fir&s;t, I mu&s;t
an&s;wer negatively; not to have us be le&s;s religious,
that we might differ le&s;s about it: But to have
us exerci&s;e more Charity in our Di&s;putes, that we
might differ more like Men of Temper, and more
like Chri&s;tians, than we do: This is &s;triking at
the Root of religious Differences; for if they were
carry'd on mildly with a peaceable Spirit, willing
to be inform'd, a Di&s;po&s;ition to Love as Brethren,
tho in every thing not like minded: Our Variety
of Opinions would not then have the Name of
Differences, we &s;hould not &s;eparate in Communion
and in Charity, tho' we did not agree in every
thing we were to believe or not believe, about
Religion.</P>
<P>It is hard that we &s;hould &s;ay the&s;e Differences
are the Con&s;equences of a Nation, having more
Religion than their Neighbours, &s;ince we have
&s;till this one Part too little; and as I &s;uppo&s;e us
to have more Religion, I mu&s;t be oblig'd to grant
we have not <HI>enough more;</HI> for if, as we have ju&s;t &s;o
much more Religion, as is &s;ufficient to make us
quarrel&s;ome in religious Di&s;putes; we had yet
as much more, as were &s;ufficient to make us
peaceable again after it, then we &s;hould be reli|gious
to Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>So that, in a Word, our being &s;o religious, as
above, is only an unhappy middle Compo&s;ition
between the enquiring and fully inform'd Chri&s;ti|an
on one Hand, and the carele&s;s, indifferent, un|concern'd
Temper, that takes up with any thing,
on the other Hand: And this I take to be a ju&s;t tho'
<PB N="176" REF="192">
&s;hort Account of our <HI>Differences in</HI> England <HI>about
Religion.</HI></P>
<P>It might be a very u&s;eful Que&s;tion to &s;tart here,
namely where all our unhappy religious Differences
will end. I that am not willing to give the wor&s;t
natur'd An&s;wer, where the be&s;t and kinde&s;t will
hold Water, am for the pre&s;ent di&s;pos'd to an&s;wer
in general, rather than de&s;cend to Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI> in
<HI>Heaven:</HI> There all our unkind, unchri&s;tian, unneigh|bourly,
unbrotherly Differences will end: We &s;hall
freely &s;hake Hands there with many a pardon'd
Sinner, that here <HI>we bid &s;tand off;</HI> embrace many a
Publican, that here we think it a Di&s;honour to con|ver&s;e
with; &s;ee many a Heart that we have broken
herewith Cen&s;ures, Reproachings, and Revilings,
made whole again by the Balm of the &s;ame Re|deemer's
Blood.</P>
<P>There we &s;hall &s;ee, that there have been other
Flocks than tho&s;e of our Fold, other Paths to
Heaven than tho&s;e we &s;hut Men out from; that
tho&s;e we have excommunicated have been taken
into that &s;uperiour Communion; and tho&s;e we
have plac'd at our Left-hands, have been there &s;um|mon'd
to the Right-hand; all Separations will
be there taken away, and the Mind of every Chri|&s;tian
be entirely reconcild to one another; no Di|vi&s;ions,
no Differences, no charging &s;incere Minds
with Hypocri&s;y, or embracing painted Hypocrites
for Saints; every thing to be &s;een, and to be
known, as it really is, and by a clear Light; none
will de&s;ire to deceive, none be &s;ubject to be de|ceived.</P>
<P>There we &s;hall look upon all we have done and
&s;aid in Prejudice of the Character of our Brethren
with a ju&s;t Change, and &s;ufficiently repair to one
another all the injurious things we have &s;aid, or
indeed but thought of one another, by rejoicing
<PB N="177" REF="193">
in the common Felicity, and prai&s;ing the &s;ove|reign
Glory, that had receiv'd tho&s;e we had foo|li&s;hly
rejected, and let tho&s;e into the &s;ame Heaven,
whom we had in the Abundance of our Pride, and
the Penury of our Charity, &s;hut out.</P>
<P>How many Actions of Men, which we, &s;eeing
only their Out-&s;ide, have now cen&s;ur'd, &s;hall we
find there, by that Penetration that cannot err, be
accepted for their in &s;ide Sincerity? How many
an Opinion, that we condemn here, &s;hall we &s;ee
then to be Orthodox? In a Word, How many
contradicting Notions and Principles, which we
thought incon&s;i&s;tent with true Religion, &s;hall we
find then to be reconcilable to them&s;elves, to one
another, and to the Fountain of Truth?</P>
<P>All the Difficulties in our Conceptions of things
invi&s;ible, will then be explain'd; all the Doctrines
of the Immutability of the divine Councils will
then be reconcilable to the changeable Events of
things, and to the Varieties often happening in
the World: The Unchangeablene&s;s of the eternal
Decrees will then appear; and yet the Efficacy of
praying to God to do this, or not do that, to
pardon, forgive, &s;pare, and forbear, which we
now &s;ay is incon&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e unchangeable
Decrees, &s;hall be reconcilable to that Unchange|ablene&s;s,
in a Manner to us now inconceiveable.</P>
<P>And this is the Foundation of what I now ad|vance,
<HI>viz.</HI> That in Heaven all our Differences in
Religion will be reconcil'd, and will be at an End.
If any Man ask me, whether they cannot be ended
before? I an&s;wer, If we were all thoroughly con|vinc'd,
that they would be reconcil'd then, we
&s;hould certainly put an End to them before; but
'tis impo&s;&s;ible to be done. Mens Convictions of
the greate&s;t and mo&s;t certain Truths, are
not equal to one another, or equal to the
<PB N="178" REF="194">
Weight and Significancy of tho&s;e Truths; and
therefore, &s;uch a general Effect of this Affair can|not
be expected on this Side of Time.</P>
<P>There is one very great Reconciler of religious
Differences in this World, which has &s;ometimes
been made u&s;e of by Providence to heal the Breaches
in Chri&s;tian Charity among religious People; and
it is, generally &s;peaking, very effectual: But it is
a bitter Draught, a Potion that goes down with
great Reluctance, and that is PERSECUTION. This
generally reconciles the Differences of Chri&s;tians,
about the le&s;&s;er Matters in Religion: The Primi|tive
Churches, while under the <HI>Roman</HI> Per&s;ecutions,
had a much greater Harmony among them&s;elves,
and very few Schi&s;ms and Divisions broke out a|mong
them. When they did differ in any Parti|cular
Points, they wrote healing Epi&s;tles to one
another, contended with Mode&s;ty and with Cha|rity,
and referr'd willingly their Notions to be de|cided
by one another. They did not &s;eparate Com|munion,
and excommunicate whole Churches and
Nations, for a Di&s;pute about the Celebration of
<HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> or unchurch one another for the Que&s;tion
of receiving and re-baptizing of Penitents, as was
afterwards the Ca&s;e. The Furnace of Affliction
burnt up all that Dro&s;s, the Fury of their Per&s;e|cutors
kept their Minds humble, their Zeal for
Religion hot, and their Affection for, and Charity
to one another encrea&s;ed as their Liberty, and their
Number was le&s;&s;ened.</P>
<P>Thus Bi&s;hop <HI>Ridley,</HI> and Bi&s;hop <HI>Hooper;</HI> the fir&s;t,
a rigid Church of <HI>England</HI> Bi&s;hop, the other, almo&s;t
a Presbyterian, or at lea&s;t a Calvini&s;t, like <HI>Peter</HI>
and <HI>Paul,</HI> differ'd hotly, and with&s;tood one ano|ther
to the Face, in the very Beginning of the Re|formation:
But when they came to burn for their
Religion, Fire and Faggot &s;hew'd them the Re|concileablene&s;s
<PB N="179" REF="195">
of all their Di&s;putes; convinc'd
them, that it was po&s;&s;ible for both to hold fa&s;t
the Truth in Sincerity, a and yet entertain differing
Notions of the Rites and Out&s;ides of the divine
O Economy, and at the Stake they ended all their
Di&s;putes, wrote healing Letters to one another,
and became Fellow-Martyrs and Confe&s;&s;ors for
that very Profe&s;&s;ion which was &s;o intermix'd with
Cen&s;ure and Di&s;like before.</P>
<P>And let all that think of this Remedy remem|ber,
that whenever the&s;e quarrel&s;ome Chri&s;tians
come, by Per&s;ecution, or any other Incident, to
be thus reconcil'd in their Charity, they find al|ways
a great deal to ask Pardon of one another
for, with re&s;pect to what is pa&s;t; all their Violence,
Heat of Zeal, and much more Heat of Pa&s;&s;ion,
all their Breach of Charity, their Reproaches and
Cen&s;ures, and hard Words, which have pa&s;s'd be|tween
them, will only then &s;erve to bring them
together with more Affection, and to Embrace
more warmly; for, depend upon it, all the Diffe|rences
in Religion among good Men, (<HI>for I do
not mean E&s;&s;ential, Doctrinal, and Fundamental
Differences</HI>) &s;erve only to make them all a&s;ham'd

Con&s;cience, tho' for a Time oppre&s;s'd and
kept under, yet upon all Occa&s;ions tells them
plainly what their Condition is, and oftentimes
they repent. 'Tis true, &s;ometimes they do not,
God is pleas'd &s;ometimes to treat them in the
vindictive Attribute, and they are cut off in their
Crimes, in&s;en&s;ible and &s;tupid, without a Space or

Hope in their profligate Living, from what I am

religious enough already, that he has no Thoughts

the World care&s;&s;es with their good Wi&s;hes, and
good Opinion, but is him&s;elf empty of real Vir|tue,
a Hypocrite at Bottom, a Cheat, and under
the Delu&s;ion of it; who&s;e Portion is with Hypo|crites,
and who can neither look in, or look up
with Plea&s;ure, but mu&s;t look without him&s;elf, for
all that can be call'd Good, either by others, or
by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As at the Great and La&s;t Day, the Secrets of
all Hearts &s;hall be di&s;clo&s;ed, &s;o I am per&s;waded,
the Opinion we have of one another here, will be
one of the Things which will be there, and per|haps
not till then fully rectify'd; and as we &s;hall
be there thorowly enlightened, we &s;hall find Room
to &s;ee, that we have been much mi&s;taken in our No|tions
of Virtue and Vice, Religion and Irreligion,
in the Characters of our Neighbours. And I am
per&s;waded, we &s;hall &s;ee many of our Acquaintan|ces
placed at the Right-hand of a righteous Judge,
who&s;e Characters we have oppre&s;&s;ed with Slanders,
and who we have cen&s;oriou&s;ly placed at his Left-hand
here: And many a painted Hypocrite, who
has in&s;ulted his Neighbour with, <HI>Stand off, I am
$olier than thou,</HI> or whom he has turned from
<PB N="184" REF="200">
with Di&s;dain, and with a <HI>This Publican!</HI> plac'd at
the Left-hand, who we made no Doubt we &s;hould
have &s;een at the Right-hand in Triumph.</P>
<P>This is a Support to the Mind of a good Man,
even when his Enemies, as <HI>David &s;ays, gna&s;h upon
him with their Teeth,</HI> and <HI>have him in Deri&s;ion,</HI>
that is to &s;ay, when he is run down by univer&s;al
Clamour, and damn'd by the Tongues of Men,
even for this World and another.</P>
<Q><L>Happy the Man, who with exalted Soul,</L>
<L>Knows how to rate the great the pro&s;p'rous Fool,</L>
<L>Who can the In&s;$lts of the Street contemn,</L>
<L>And values not the Rage or Tongues of Men?</L>
<L>He like the Sun exi&s;ts on his own Flame,</L>
<L>And when he dies, is to him&s;elf <HI>a Fame.</HI></L></Q>
<P>But take this with you as you go, that as nega|tive
Prai&s;e will build no Man Comfort, &s;o nega|tive
Virtue will not &s;upport the Mind under uni|ver&s;al
Contempt. <HI>Scandal</HI> is much wor&s;e than
<HI>Slander;</HI> for the fir&s;t is founded upon real Guilt,
the other attacks Innocence. Nothing is a Scan|dal,
but what <HI>is true:</HI> Nothing is a Slander, but
what is <HI>fal&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>He that fortifies him&s;elf again&s;t Reproach, mu&s;t
do it with a certain Re&s;erve of Real, and &s;olid Vir|tue,
and Piety; it mu&s;t be Uprightne&s;s and Inte|grity
that mu&s;t pre&s;erve him; nothing but a Fund
of what is good can &s;upport the Mind under the
Reproach of being all that is bad; I do not mean
neither, that the Man mu&s;t be perfect, have no
Follies or Failings, have made no Excur&s;ions, have
nothing to be laid to the Charge of his Character;
for where then &s;hall the Man be found I am &s;pea|king
of? And I may be &s;aid to be de&s;cribing the
<PB N="185" REF="201">
Black-&s;wan, a Per&s;on that is not, and never was
to be found: But the right Way of judging Men,
and the Way which alone can be ju&s;t, is to judge
of them by their general Conduct; and &s;o a Man
may in his own Mind ju&s;tly denominate him&s;elf:
As every$ good Action does not denominate me
to be a good Man, &s;o neither does every Failing,
every Folly, no nor every &s;candalous Action, de|nominate
me a Hypocrite, or a wicked Man;
otherwi&s;e, &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent Saints in Scrip|ture,
and of every Age &s;ince the Scripture was
written, are gone to the Devil; and 'twill be
hard to &s;ay, there was ever a good Man in the
World.</P>
<P>But I return to my Subject, the negative good
Man; and let me examine him a little in his ju&s;t
Character, in his Conduct, publick and private:
He is no Drunkard, but is intoxicated with the
Pride of his own Worth: He is a good Neigh|bour,
a common Arbitrator and Peace-maker in
other Families, but a cur&s;ed Tyrant in his own:
He appears in a publick Place of Wor&s;hip for a
Show, but never enters into his Clo&s;et and &s;huts
the Door about him, to pray to him that &s;ees in
Secret: He is covered with the vain-glorious,
and o&s;tentatious Part of Charity, but does all his
Alms before Men, <HI>to be &s;een of them:</HI> He is migh|ty
eager in the Duties of the &s;econd Table, but re|gardle&s;s
of the fir&s;t; appearingly religious to be
&s;een and taken Notice of by Men; but between
God and his own Soul, no Entercour&s;e, no Com|munication:
What is this Man? And what Com|fort
is there of the Life he lives? He knows lit|tle,
or perhaps nothing of Faith, Repentance, and
a Chri&s;tian mortified Life: In a Word, he is a
Man perfect in the Circum&s;tances of Religion,
<PB N="186" REF="202">
and perfectly a Stranger to the e&s;&s;ential Part of
Religion.</P>
<P>Take this Man's Conver&s;ation apart, enter into
the private and retir'd Part of it, What Notions
has he of mi&s;pent Hours, and of the natural Re|flux
of all our Minutes, on to the great Center and
Gulph of Life, <HI>Eternity?</HI> Does he know how to
put a right Value upon <HI>Time?</HI> Does he e&s;teem it
<HI>the Life-Blood of his Soul,</HI> as it really is, and act
in all the Moments of it, as one that mu&s;t ac|count
for them? Alas! this is of no Weight with
&s;uch a Man; he is too full of him&s;elf to enter in|to
any Notions about an Account, either for mi|&s;pent
Time, or any thing el&s;e mi&s;done; but per|&s;wading
him&s;elf, that he never did any thing ami&s;s,
entertains no Notion of Judgment to come, Eter|nity,
or any thing in it.</P>
<P>What Room has a Man to expatiate in
his Thoughts upon &s;o immen&s;e and inconceivable
a Subject, as that of eternal Duration, who&s;e
Thoughts are all taken up, and &s;well'd Top-full
with his own extraordinary &s;elf. It would be im|po&s;&s;ible
for any Man in the World to entertain one
proud Thought of him&s;elf, if he had but one
right Idea of a future State. Could &s;uch a Man
think, that any thing in him, or any thing he could
do, could purcha&s;e for him, a Felicity that was
to la&s;t to Eternity? What! that a Man &s;hould be ca|pable
in one Moment (for Life is not that in Length
compar'd to Eternity) to do any thing for which he
&s;hould de&s;erve to be made happy to Eternity?</P>
<P>If then you can form no Equality between what
he can do, and what he &s;hall receive; le&s;s can it be
founded upon his negative Virtue, or what he has
forborn to do; and if neither his negative nor his
po&s;itive Piety can be equal to the Reward, and to
the Eternity that Reward is to la&s;t for; Wh$$
<PB N="187" REF="203">
then is become of the Phari&s;ee? he mu&s;t think no
more of him&s;elf, for all his Boa&s;ts; neither of his
Negatives nor his Po&s;itives, but of a rich unboun|ded
Grace, that rewards according to it&s;elf, not
according to what we can do; and that to be
judged at the la&s;t Day according to our Works,
if literally under&s;tood, would be to be undone;
but we are to be judged by the Sincerity of our
Repentance, be rewarded according to the infi|nite
Grace of God, and Purcha&s;e of Chri&s;t,
with a State of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s to an endle&s;s Eter|nity.</P>
<P>Indeed this Eternity is not a Meditation &s;uita|ble
to the Man I am talking of, 'tis a &s;ublime
Thought, which his bloated Imagination has never
de&s;cended to, or engag'd in; and when it comes,
he is like to have as little Comfort of it, as he has
had Thought about it.</P>
<P>This Thought of Eternity rai&s;es new Ideas in
my Mind, and I cannot go forward without a
Digre&s;&s;ion upon &s;o important a Subject; if the
Reader approves the Thought, he will not quar|rel
about its being a Digre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>But to the Purpo&s;e in Hand; for I have not
done with this Man of Negatives yet: And now
let us bring him more nearly and &s;eriou&s;ly to a
Conver&s;e with the invi&s;ible World: He looks in|to
it with Horror and dreadful Apprehen&s;ions; as
<HI>Foelix,</HI> when St. <HI>Paul</HI> rea&s;oned of Temperance, Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,
and of Judgment to come. <HI>Foelix,</HI> was
<PB N="191" REF="207">
a moral Heathen, that is to &s;ay, a Man of Nega|tives,
like him I am &s;peaking of. What was
then the Ca&s;e? he trembl'd; Pray, what is it rea|&s;onable
to think <HI>Foelix</HI> trembled at? if I may give
my Opinion, who am but a very mean Expo&s;itor
of Texts, it was this or &s;omething like it.</P>
<P><HI>Foelix</HI> was a Philo&s;opher, as well as a Man of
Power; and by his Wi&s;dom, as al&s;o by his Reve|rence
of the Gods, which at that Time was the
Sum of Religion, had been a Man of Morals, a
Man that had practic'd Temperance and Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s,
as the Life which was unque&s;tionably to
be rewarded by the Powers above, with an Ely|&s;ian
Felicity; that is to &s;ay, according to the <HI>Ro|man</HI>
Maxim, That the Gods were the Rewarders
of Virtue.</P>
<P>But when the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle came to rea&s;on
with <HI>Foelix,</HI> how unlikely it was, that the&s;e Ne|gatives
&s;hould purcha&s;e our Happine&s;s hereafter,
he &s;hew'd him, that the Gods could not be in Debt
to us for the Practice of Virtue, which was indeed no
more than living mo&s;t &s;uitable to our Rea&s;on,
that a Life of Virtue and Temperance was its own
Reward, by giving a healthy Body, a clear Head,
a compos'd Life, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> fitting the Man for all
other worldly Enjoyments, adequate to his Rea|&s;on,
and his pre&s;ent Felicity as a Man: But
eternal Happine&s;s mu&s;t come from another Spring,
namely from the infinite unbounded Grace of a
provok'd God, who having erected a righteous
Tribunal, where every Heart &s;hould be &s;earched,
and where every Tongue would confe&s;s it&s;elf guil|ty,
and &s;tand &s;elf-condemn'd. Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom
<HI>Paul</HI> preach'd, would &s;eparate &s;uch as by Faith and
Repentance he had brought home, and united to
him&s;elf by the Grace of Adoption, and on the
<PB N="192" REF="208">
Foot of his having laid down his Life a Ran&s;om
for them, $ad appointed them to Salvation.</P>
<P>When poor Negative <HI>Foelix</HI> heard of this, and
that all his Philo&s;ophy, his Temperance, and
Righteou&s;ne&s;s, if it had been ten thou&s;and Times
as great, could weigh nothing, and plead nothing
for him at that Judicature; and that he began to
&s;ee the Ju&s;tice and Rea&s;on of this; $or <HI>Paul</HI> rea|&s;oned
him into it; I &s;ay, when he &s;aw this, he
trembl'd indeed, as well he might, and as all ne|gative
People will.</P>
<P>What a &s;trange Idea mu&s;t that Phari&s;ee have of
God, who went up with the Publican to the Tem|ple
to pray: 'Tis ob&s;ervable, he went with a good
Stock of A&s;&s;urance in his Face, that could come to
the Altar, as he did, not to offer any Sacrifice; we
don't find he carry'd any Offering, or be&s;poke
the Prie&s;t to make any Attonement; he wanted no
Prie&s;ts to make any Confe&s;&s;ion to: Good Man, as
he thought he was, he had no Sins to confe&s;s;
he rather came up to the Altar to even Accounts
with Heaven; and like the other Man in the Go&s;|pel,
tell God, that he had fulfill'd the whole Law,
and had done all tho&s;e things that were command|ed,
even from his Youth; &s;o, as before, he only pul|led
off his Hat to his God, and let him know,
that there was nothing between them at pre&s;ent,
and away he goes about his Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>But the poor Wretch, whom he de&s;pis'd, and
whom he had left behind him, for he dur&s;t come no
farther, acted quite another Part. He had at fir&s;t
indeed, in Sence of his Duty, re&s;olv'd to go up to
the Temple; But when he &s;aw the Splendor and
Maje&s;ty of God repre&s;ented by the Glory of that
elevated Building; I &s;ay, when he &s;aw that, tho'
a great Way off,, and then look'd into his own
Heart, all his negative Confidences failing him,
<PB N="193" REF="209">
and a Sen&s;e of mi&s;erable Circum&s;tances coming
upon him, he &s;tops &s;hort, and with a Blow of Re|flection
and perfectly unmixt with any of the Pha|ri&s;ees
Pride, he looks down in Humility, but lifts
up his Heart in a penitential Faith, with a <HI>Lord be
merciful to me a Sinner.</HI></P>
<P>Here was Faith, Repentance, Duty, and Con|fe&s;&s;ion,
all conjoin'd in one Act, and the Man's
Work was done at once, <HI>he went away ju&s;tified;</HI>
when the negative Phari&s;ee went home, the &s;ame|&s;elf
vain Wretch, that he came out with <HI>God I
thank thee</HI> in his Mouth, and a M$$&s;s of Pride in
his Heart, that nothing could convince.</P>
<P>In what glorious Colours do the Scriptures up|on
all Occasions repre&s;ent tho&s;e two <HI>Hand in Hand</HI>
Graces, <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance?</HI> There is not one
Mention of Faith in the whole Scripture, but
what is recommending &s;ome Way or other to our
Admiration, and to our Practice; 'tis the Foun|dation
and the Top-&s;tone of all Religion, the
Right-hand to lead, and the Left-hand to &s;upport,
in the whole Journey of a Chri&s;tian, even thro' this
World, and into the next: In a Word, 'tis the
S$$m and Sub&s;tance of the Go&s;pel Foundation.</P>
<P>Religion &s;eems to have been founded upon three
E&s;tabli&s;hments in the World; in all which the
Terms of Life are laid down at the End of our
Acceptance of it.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment was with <HI>Adam</HI> in <HI>Pa|radi&s;e;</HI>
the Terms of which were, FORBEAR <HI>and
Live.</HI></P>
<P>The Second E&s;tabli&s;hment was with the Chil|dren

<P>The Third E&s;tabli&s;hment is that of the Go&s;pel
of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; the Terms of which are, BELIEVE
<HI>and Liv</HI></P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="210">
So that in a Word, Faith is the Sub&s;tance
and Fulfilling of Go&s;pel Religion, the Plan of
Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the great Efficient of eter|nal
Life. Let me break out here upon this glo|rious

If all this be to be &s;aid, and all indeed but a Poe|tical
Trifle upon this exalted Subject, What is be|come
of our Negative Chri&s;tian in all this? There
is not a Word of Negative Religion in all the De|&s;cription
of Faith, any more than there is of Faith
in all our Negative Religion.</P>
<P>Now let us follow this poor Negative Wretch to
his Death-bed, and there having very little other
Notion of Religion; for 'tis the Fate of tho&s;e
that tru&s;t to their Negatives, to have little el&s;e in
their Thoughts: If a good Man come to talk with
him, if he talks out of that Way, he puts him all
into Confu&s;ion; for if he cannot &s;wim upon the
Bladders of his Negatives, he drowns immediate|ly,
or he bouys him&s;elf up above your Reproofs,
and goes on as before: He is a little like the <HI>Po|li&s;h</HI>
Captain <HI>Uratz,</HI> who was executed for the Mur|ther
of Mr. <HI>Thynne,</HI> who, when they talk't to him
of Repentance, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;aid, he was
of &s;uch and &s;uch a Family, and he hop'd God would
have &s;ome Re&s;pect to him as a Gentleman.</P>
<P>But what mu&s;t a poor Mini&s;ter do, who being
fill'd with better Principles, prays for this vain
glorious Man? Mu&s;t he &s;ay, Lord accept this
good Man, for he has been no Drunkard, no Swea|$er,
no debauch'd Per&s;on; $he has been a ju&s;t, a
charitable Man, has done a great deal of Good
among his Neighbours, and never wilfully wrong'd
any Man; he has not been &s;o wicked as it is the
Cu&s;tom of the Times to be; nor has he &s;hewn
bad Examples to others; Lord be merciful to this
excellent good Man?</P>
<P>No, no, the poor &s;incere Miui&s;ter knows better
things; and if he prays with him, he turns him
quite in-&s;ide-out, repre&s;ents him as a poor mi&s;ta|ken

and has nothing in him&s;elf, but ca&s;ts him&s;elf en|tirely,

<P>_WE are naturally backward to inform

off any farther Enquiries of that kind.</P>
<P>Hence I ob&s;erve the wi&s;e&s;t of Men often run
into Mi&s;takes about the Things, which &s;peaking
of Religion we call <HI>Duty,</HI> taking up &s;light Notions
of them, and believing they under&s;tand enough of
them; by which they rob them&s;elves of the Ad|vantage,
as well as Comfort of a farther &s;earch.
Or on the other hand, taking up with the gene|ral
Knowledge of religious Princ$ples, and the
common Duties of a Chri&s;tian Life, are &s;atisfy'd
with knowing what they &s;ay is &s;ufficient to carry
them to Heaven, without enquiring into tho&s;e
Things which are helpful and a&s;&s;i&s;tant to make
that &s;trait Path ea&s;y and plea&s;ant to them&s;elves;
and to make them u&s;eful to others by the

<P><HI>Solomon</HI> was quite of another Opinion, when
he bid us <HI>cry after Knowledge, and lift up</HI> our <HI>Voice
<PB N="205" REF="221">
for Under&s;tanding; dig for her as for Silver,</HI> and <HI>&s;earch
for her as for hid Trea&s;ure.</HI> It is certain here that he
meant religious Knowledge; and it is explained
in the very next Words, with an encouraging Pro|mi&s;e
to tho&s;e that &s;hall enter upon the Search. (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<HI>Then &s;halt thou under&s;tand the Fear of the LORD,
and find the Knowledge of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>I am of Opinion that it is our unque&s;tioned
Duty, to enquire after every Thing in our Jour|ney
to the eternal Habitation, which God has
permitted us to know, and thus to rai&s;e Difficul|ties
in the Way of our ju&s;t &s;earch into divine Di&s;|coveries
is to act, like <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Sluggard, who &s;aith,
<HI>There is a Lion without, I &s;hall be &s;lain in the Streets,</HI>
Prov. xxii. 13. <HI>that is,</HI> he &s;its down in his Ignorance
repuls'd with imaginary difficulties, without making
one Step in the &s;earch after the Knowledge, which
he ought to <HI>dig for, as for hid Trea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>Let us then be encourag'd to our Duty; let us
boldly enquire after every Thing that God has
permitted us to know; I grant that &s;ecret Things
belong to God, and I &s;hall labour to keep my due
Di&s;tance. But I firmly believe, that there are no
&s;ecret Things belonging to God, and which
as &s;uch we are forbidden to enquire into, but what
al&s;o are &s;o pre&s;erv'd in Secrecy, that by all our
Enquiries we cannot arrive to the Knowledge of
them; and it is a mo&s;t merciful, as well as wi&s;e
Di&s;pen&s;ation, that we are only forbid enquiring
after the&s;e Things which we cannot know; and
that all tho&s;e Things are effectually lock'd up from
our Knowledge, which we are forbidden to en|quire
into. The Ca&s;e is better with us, than it
was with <HI>Adam.</HI> We have not the Tree of Know|ledge
fir&s;t planted in our View, as it were tempt|ing
us with its Beauty, and within our Reach,
and then a Prohibition upon Pain of Death: But
<PB N="206" REF="222">
ble&s;&s;ed be God, we may eat of all the Trees in
the Garden; and all tho&s;e of which we are not
allow'd to take, are plac'd both out of our Sight,
and out of our Reach.</P>
<P>I am making Way here to one of the Trees of
&s;acred Knowledge, which tho' it may grow in the
thicke&s;t of the Wood, and be &s;urrounded with
&s;ome Briars and Thorns, &s;o as to place it a little
out of Sight; yet I hope to prove, that it is our
Duty to ta&s;te of it: and that the Way to come at
it, is both practicable and plain.</P>
<P>But to wave the Allegory, as I am entring into
the nice&s;t Search of divine things, that perhaps the
whole Scheme of Religion directs us to; 'tis ab|&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary at our Entrance, <HI>if po&s;&s;ible,</HI> to re|move
every Difficulty, explain every Principle,
and lay down every Foundation &s;o undeniably
clear, that nothing may appear dark or my&s;terious
in our fir&s;t Conceptions of things; no Stumbling|block
lye at the Thre&s;hold, and the humble Rea|der

<P><HI>Li&s;tening to the Voice of Providence,</HI> is my Subject:

That there is a God, a fir&s;t great moving Cau&s;e

<HI>Superior</HI> to all Power and Being. 2. That
this eternal Power, which I call God, is the Crea|tor
and Governour of all things, <HI>viz.</HI> of Heaven
and Earth.</P>
<P>To avoid needle&s;s Di&s;tinctions concerning which
of the Per&s;ons in the God-head, are exerci&s;ed in the

I offer that glorious Text, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> xxxiii. 6 as a

Repul&s;e to all &s;uch $avilling Enquiries, where the

Heaven, and the Earth, the Sea, and all that in

<P>1. That this Eternal God guides by his Provi|dence
the whole World, which he has created by his
Power.</P>
<P>2. That this Providence manife&s;ts a particular Care
over, and Concern in the governing and directing Man,
the be&s;t and la&s;t created Creature on Earth.</P>
<P><HI>Natural Religion</HI> proves the fir&s;t, reveal'd Reli|gion
proves the la&s;t of the&s;e beyond Contradiction.
<HI>Natural Religion</HI> intimates the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Pro|vidence
guiding and governing the World, from
the Con&s;equence of the Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice, Pre|&s;cience,
and Goodne&s;s of the Creator.</P>
<P>It would be ab&s;urd to conceive of God exer|ting
infinite Power to create a World, and not
concerning his Wi&s;dom, which is his Providence,
in guiding the Operations of Nature, &s;o as to pre|&s;erve
the Order of his Creation, and the Obedi|ence
and Subordination of Con&s;equences and Cau|&s;es
throughout the Cour&s;e of that Nature,
which is in Part the inferior Life of that Cre|ation.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="224">

Tenant to the great Proprietor, who is Lord of

not be conceiv'd, without great Incon&s;i&s;tency of
Thought, that this World isle ft entirely to Man's
Conduct without the &s;upervi&s;ing Influence and
the &s;ecret Direction of the Creator.</P>

Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice, and Goodne&s;s of God, by
which he influences, governs, and directs, not on|ly
the Means, but the Events of all things, which
concern us in this World.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, it is <HI>that Operation,</HI> let them call it what
they will, which acts thus; I am noway concern'd
to &s;hew how it acts, or why it acts thus and thus
in particular; we are to reverence its Sovereignty,
<PB N="209" REF="225">
as it is the Finger of God him&s;elf, who is the &s;o|vereign
Director, and we are to ob&s;erve its Mo|tions,
obey its Dictates, and <HI>li&s;ten to its Voice,</HI> as
it is, and becau&s;e it is particularly employ'd for
our Advantage.</P>
<P>It would be a very proper and u&s;eful Ob&s;erva|tion
here, and might take up much of this Work,
to illu&s;trate the Goodne&s;s of Providence, in that it
is, <HI>as I &s;ay,</HI> particularly employ'd for the Advan|tage
of Mankind: But, as this is not the main
De&s;ign, and will come in naturally in every Part of
the Work I am upon, I refer it to the common In|ferences,
which are to be drawn from the Particu|lars,
as I go on.</P>
<P>It is indeed the mo&s;t rational Foundation of the
whole De&s;ign before me; 'tis therefore that we
&s;hould <HI>li&s;ten to the Voice of Providence,</HI> becau&s;e it is
principally determin'd, and determines all other
things for our Advantage.</P>
<P>But I return to the main Subject, <HI>The Voice of
Providence,</HI> the Language or the Meaning of Pro|vidence.</P>
<P>Nothing is more frequent, than for us to mi&s;take
Providence, even in its mo&s;t vi&s;ible Appearances;
How ea&s;y then mu&s;t it be, to let its &s;ilent Actings,
which perhaps are the mo&s;t pungent and &s;ignificant,
pa&s;s our Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>I am aware of the Error many fall into, who
determining the univer&s;al Currency of Events to
Providence, and that not the minute&s;t thing occurs
in the Cour&s;e of Life, but by the particular De&s;ti|nation
of Heaven, by Con&s;equence entitle Provi|dence
to the Efficiency of their own Follies; as
if a Per&s;on, pre&s;uming to &s;moke his Pipe in a
Magazin of Gun-Powder, &s;hould reproach Provi|dence
with blowing up the Ca&s;tle, for which in|deed
he ought to be hang'd; or a Man leaving his
<PB N="210" REF="226">
Hou&s;e or Shop open in the Night, &s;hould charge
Providence with appointing him to be robb'd, <HI>and
the like:</HI> Nay, to carry it farther, every Murtherer
or Thief may allege Providence, that determines
and directs every thing, directed him to &s;uch Wic|kedne&s;s,
whereas Providence it&s;elf, notwith&s;tan|ding
the Crimes of Men, is actively concern'd in
no Evil.</P>
<P>But I pa&s;s all the&s;e things; the Subject I am
treating upon, is of another Nature: The De&s;ign
here, is to in&s;truct us in &s;ome particular things re|lating
to Providence and its Government of
Men in the World, which it will be worth our
While to ob&s;erve, without enquiring how far it
does or does not act in other Methods.</P>
<P>There is, 'tis true, a Difficulty to &s;hake off all the
wry Steps, which People take to amu&s;e them|&s;elves
about Providence; and for this Rea&s;on, I
take &s;o much Pains at fir&s;t to avoid them: Many
Men entitle Providence to things, which it is not
concern'd about, <HI>&s;peaking ab&s;tractedly;</HI> but, <HI>which is
a much wor&s;e Error,</HI> many al&s;o take no Notice of
tho&s;e things, which Providence particularly, and
even in a very remarkable Manner, di&s;tingui&s;hes it
&s;elf by <HI>its Concern</HI> in.</P>
<P>If Providence guides the World, and directs the
I&s;&s;ues and Events of things, if it commands cau&s;es,
and forms the Connection of Circum&s;tances in the
World, as no Man, that owns the Principles men|tioned
above, will deny: And above all, if the
general Scope of Providence, and of the Govern|ment
of the World by its Influence, be for our
Advantage; then it follows nece&s;&s;arily, that it
is our Bu&s;ine&s;s, and our Intere&s;t, <HI>to li&s;ten to its
Voice.</HI></P>
<P>By Li&s;tning to the Voice of Providence, I
mean, to &s;tudy its Meaning in every Circum&s;tance
<PB N="211" REF="227">
of Life, in every Event; to learn to under&s;tand the
End and De&s;ign of Providence in every thing than
happens, what is the De&s;ign of Providence in it,
re&s;pecting our &s;elves, and what our Duty to do
upon the particular Occa&s;ion that offers. I$ a Man
were in Danger of drowning in a &s;hipwreck'd
Ve&s;&s;el, and Providence pre&s;ented a Boat coming
towards him, he would &s;carce want to be told,
that it was his Bu&s;ine&s;s to make Signals of Di&s;tre&s;s,
that the People in the &s;aid Boat might not pa&s;s
by ignorant of his Condition, and give him no
A&s;&s;i&s;tance; if he did, and omitted it, he would
have little Cau&s;e to concern Providence in his
Ruine.</P>
<P>There is certainly a Rebellion again&s;t Provi|dence,
which Heaven it&s;elf will not always con|cern
it&s;elf to over-rule; and he that throws him|&s;elf
into a River to drown him&s;elf, he that hangs
him&s;elf up to a Beam, he that &s;hoots him&s;elf into
the Head with a Pi&s;tol, &s;hall die in Spite of all
the Notions of Decree, De&s;tiny, Fate, or what
ever we weakly call Providence; in &s;uch Ca&s;es,
Providence will not always concern it&s;elf to pre|vent
it; and yet 'tis no Impeachment of the So|vereignty
of Heaven, in directing, decreeing, and
governing all Events in the World.</P>
<P>Providence decrees, that Events &s;hall attend up|on
Cau&s;es in a direct Chain, and by an evident
Nece&s;&s;ity, and has doubtle&s;s left many Powers of
Good and Evil, &s;eemingly to our &s;elves, and, as
it were, in our Hands, as the natural Product of
&s;uch Cau&s;es and Con&s;equences, which we are not
to limit, and cannot expre&s;sly determine about,
but which we are accountable for the good or evil
Application of; otherwi&s;e we were in vain ex|horted
and commanded to do any good thing, or
to avoid any wicked one: Rewards and Puni&s;h|ments
<PB N="212" REF="228">
would be incongruous with &s;overeign Ju&s;tice;
and Promi&s;es, and Threatnings, be perfectly un|meaning
u&s;ele&s;s things, Mankind being no free
Agent to him&s;elf, or entru&s;ted with the nece&s;&s;ary
Powers, which tho&s;e Promi&s;es and Threatnings
imply.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e things are out of my pre&s;ent En|quiry;
I am for freely and entirely &s;ubmitting all
Events to Providence; but not to be &s;upinely and
unconcernedly pa&s;&s;ive, as if there was nothing
warnings, in&s;tructing, or directing in the Premoni|tions
of God's Providence; and which he expe|cted
we &s;hould take Notice of, and take Warning
by. <HI>The prudent Man fore&s;eeth the Evil, and
hideth him&s;elf:</HI> How does he fore&s;ee it, &s;ince 'tis
not in Man to direct him&s;elf? There are Intima|tions
given us, by which a prudent Man may &s;ome|times
fore&s;ee Evil, and hide him&s;elf; and I mu&s;t
take the&s;e all out of the Devil's Hands, if po&s;&s;i|ble,
and place Providence at the Head of the in|vi&s;ible
World, as well as at the Helm of this
World; and tho' I abhor &s;uper&s;titious and &s;cepti|cal
Notions of the World of Spirits, of which
I purpo&s;e to &s;peak hereafter, either in this Work,
or in &s;ome other by it&s;elf; I &s;ay, tho' I am not at
all a Sceptick, yet I cannot doubt, but that the
invi&s;ible Hand of Providence, which guides and
governs this World, does with a &s;ecret Power like|wi&s;e
influence the World, and may, and I believe
does, direct from thence &s;ilent Me&s;&s;engers on many
Occa&s;ions, whether &s;leeping or waking, whether
directly or indirectly, whether by Hints, Impul|&s;es,
Allegories, My&s;teries, or otherwi&s;e, we know
not; and does think fit to give us &s;uch Alarms, &s;uch
previous and particular Knowledge of things,
that it li&s;ten'd to, might many Ways be u&s;eful to
<PB N="213" REF="229">
the prudent Man to fore&s;ee the Evil, and hide
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The only Objection, and which I can &s;ee no
Method to give a Rea&s;on for, and no An&s;wer to,
is, Why, if it be the Work of Providence, tho&s;e
things &s;hould be &s;o imperfect, &s;o broken, &s;o irre|gular,
that Men may either never be able to pa&s;s
any right Judgment of them, as is &s;ometimes the
Ca&s;e, or make a perfect Judgment of them, which
is often the Ca&s;e, and &s;o the End of the Intima|tion
be entirely defeated, without any Fault, Ne|glect,
or Omi&s;&s;ion of the Man.</P>
<P>This we can no more account for, than we
can for the Hand-writing upon the Wall at the
great Fea&s;t of <HI>Bel&s;hazzer, viz.</HI> why it was writ|ten
in a Character, which none could under&s;tand;
and which, if the Prophet had not been-found,
had perhaps never been known, or at lea&s;t, not till
the King's Fate, which was even then irretrieva|ble,
had been over.</P>
<P>This, indeed, we cannot account for, and can
only &s;ay, 'tis our Duty to &s;tudy the&s;e things, to li&s;ten
to the Voice of them, and obey their &s;ecret Di|ctates,
as far as Rea&s;on directs, without an over
&s;uper&s;titious Regard to them, any more than a
total Neglect, leaving the Rea&s;on of Providence's
acting thus, to be better under&s;tood hereafter.</P>
<P>But to de&s;cribe a little what I mean by Li&s;ten|ing
to the Voice of Providence; it is the Rever&s;e
of the &s;upine &s;tupid Man, who&s;e Character I &s;hall
come to by and by. The Man I would recom|mend,
lives fir&s;t in a general Belief, that Provi|dence
has the &s;upreme Direction of all his Affairs,
even of his in particular, as well as tho&s;e of the
World; that 'tis his Mercy that it is &s;o, that 'tis
the Effect of an infinitely wi&s;e and gracious Di&s;po|&s;ition
from above, that he &s;ub&s;i&s;ts; and that 'tis
<PB N="214" REF="230">
not below the Dignity any more than 'tis remote
from the Power of an infinite, wi&s;e, and good
Being, to take Cognizance of the lea&s;t thing con|cerning
him.</P>
<P>This in the Con&s;equence obliges him to all I
&s;ay, for to him who firmly believes, that Provi|dence
&s;toops to concern it&s;elf for him, and to or|der
the lea&s;t Article of his Affairs, it nece&s;&s;arily
follows, that he &s;hould concern him&s;elf in every
thing that Providence does, <HI>which comes within his
Reach,</HI> that he may know whether he be intere&s;ted
in it or no.</P>
<P>If he neglects this, he neglects him&s;elf; he a|bandons
all Concern about him&s;elf, &s;ince he does
not know, but that the very next particular Act of
Providence, which comes within his Reach to
di&s;tingui&s;h, may be intere&s;ted in him, and he
in it.</P>
<P>It is not for me to dictate here to any Man,
what particular things, relating to him, Providence
is concern'd in, or what not; or how far any In|cident
of Life is or is not the particular Act and
Deed of the Government of Providence: But as
it is the receiv'd Opinion of every good Man, that
nothing befalls us without the active or pa&s;&s;ive
Concern of Providence in it; &s;o it is impo&s;&s;ible
this good Man can be unconcern'd in what|ever
that Providence determines concerning
him.</P>
<P>If it be true, as our Saviour him&s;elf &s;ays, <HI>That
not a Hair falls from our Heads without the Will of
our heavenly Father,</HI> then not a Hair ought to fall
from our Heads, without our having our Eyes up
to our heavenly Father in it.</P>
<P>I take the Text in its due Latitude, namely,
that not the minute&s;t Incident of Life, befalls us
without the active Will of our Father directing it,
<PB N="215" REF="231">
or the pa&s;&s;ive Will of our Father &s;uffering it, &s;o
I take the Deduction from it in the &s;ame Latitude;
that nothing of how mean a Nature &s;oever can
befal us, but we ought to have our Eyes up to
our heavenly Father in it, be re&s;ign'd to him in
the Event, and &s;ubjected to him in the Means;
and he that neglects this, lives in Contempt of
Providence, and that in the mo&s;t provoking Man|ner
po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I am not an&s;werable for any Extremes the&s;e
Things may lead weak People into; I know &s;ome
are apt to entitle the Hand of God, to the com|mon
and mo&s;t ridiculous Trifles in Nature;
as a religious Creature, I knew, &s;eeing a Bot|tle
of Beer being over ripe bur&s;t out, the Cork fly
up again&s;t the Ceiling, and the Froth follow it like
an Engin, cried out, <HI>O! the Wonders of Omnipo|tent
Power:</HI> But I am repre&s;enting, how a Chri&s;tian
with an awful Regard to the Government of Provi|dence
in the World, and particularly in all his own
Affairs, &s;ubjects his Mind to a con&s;tant Obedience
to the Dictates of that Providence, gives an humble
Preference to it in all his Conclu&s;ions, waits the
I&s;&s;ues of it with a chearful Re&s;ignation; and in a
Word li&s;tens carefully to the Voice of Providence,
that he may be always obedient to the heavenly
Vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Whether this divine Emanation has any Con|cern
in the Notices, Omens, Dreams, Voices,
Hints, Forebodings, Impul&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which &s;eem
to be a kind of Communication with the invi|&s;ible
World, and a Conver&s;e between the Spi|rits
embodied and tho&s;e unembodied, and how
far without Prejudice to the Honour and our Reve|rence
of Providence, and without Danger of
Sceptici&s;m, and a kind of radicated Infidelity,
tho&s;e Things may be regarded, is a nice and dif|ficult
<PB N="116" REF="232">
Thing to re&s;olve, and I &s;hall treat of it by
it &s;elf.</P>
<P>It has been the Opinion of good Men of all
Ages, to &s;ay how far they are to be depend|ed
upon, that &s;uch Things are not to be to|tally
di&s;regarded, I am not to take upon me,
How far they may or may not be concerned in the
Influence of Providence, I al&s;o dare not &s;ay: But as
the Verity of A&s;tronomy is evidenced by the
Calculation of Eclip&s;es, &s;o the Certainty of this
Communication of Spirits is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the
Concurrence of Events with the Notices they
&s;ometimes give; and if it be true, as I mu&s;t be|lieve,
that the Divine Providence takes Cogni&s;ance
of all Things belonging to us, I dare not exclude
it from having &s;ome Concern, <HI>how much I do not &s;ay,</HI>
in the&s;e Things al&s;o: But of this in its Place.</P>
<P>Whenever Providence di&s;covers any thing of this
<HI>Ar$anum,</HI> I de&s;ire to li&s;ten to the Voice of it; and
this is one of the Things I recommend to others:
Indeed I would be very cautious, how I li&s;ten to
any other Voices from that Country, than &s;uch as I
am &s;ure are conveyed to me from Heaven for my
better under&s;tanding the whole My&s;tery.</P>
<P>If then we are to li&s;ten to the Voice of Nature, and
to the Voices of Creatures, <HI>viz.</HI> to the Voice of the
invi&s;ible Agents of the World of Spirits as above,
much more are we to li&s;ten to the Voice of God.</P>
<P>I have already hinted that he that made the
World, <HI>we are &s;ure</HI> guides it, and his Provi|dence
is equally wonderful as his Power: But no|thing
in the whole Cour&s;e of his Providence is
more worthy our Regard, e&s;pecially as it con|cerns
us his Creatures, than the &s;ilent Voice, <HI>if it
may be allowed me to call it &s;o,</HI> of his managing
Events and Cau&s;es; he that li&s;tens to the Provi|dence
of God, li&s;tens to the Voice of God,
<PB N="217" REF="233">
as he is &s;een in the Wonders of his Government,
and as he is &s;een in the Wonders of his Omni|potence.</P>
<P>If then the Events of Things are his, as well
as the Cau&s;es, it is certainly well worth our
Notice, when the Sympathy or Relation between
Events of Things and their Cau&s;es, mo&s;t emi|nently
appears; and how can any Man, who has
the lea&s;t Inclination to ob&s;erve what is remarka|ble
in the World, &s;hut his Eyes to the vi&s;ible
Di&s;covery, which there is in the Events of
Providence, of a &s;upreme Hand guiding them;
for Example, when vi&s;ible Puni&s;hments follow vi|&s;ible
Crimes, who can refrain confe&s;&s;ing the appa|rent
Direction of &s;upreme Ju&s;tice? When Concur|rence
of Circum&s;tances directs to the Cau&s;e,
Men that take no Notice of &s;uch remarkable
Pointings of Providence, openly contemn Hea|ven,
and frequently &s;tand in the Light of their
own Advantages.</P>
<P>The Concurrence of Events, is a Light to
their Cau&s;es, and the Methods of Heaven in
&s;ome Things, are a happy Guide to us to make a
Judgment in others; he that is deaf to the&s;e
Things, &s;huts his Ears to In&s;truction, and like
<HI>Solomon</HI>'s Fool, <HI>hates Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>The Di&s;po&s;itions of Heaven to approve or con|demn
our Actions, are many of them di&s;covered
by Ob&s;ervation; and 'tis ea&s;y to know, when that
Hand of Providence opens the Door for, or
&s;huts it again&s;t our Mea&s;ures, if we will bring
Cau&s;es together, and compare former Things
with pre&s;ent, making our Judgment by the ordinary
Rules of Heaven's dealing with Men.</P>
<P>How, and from what Hand come the frequent
In&s;tances of &s;evere Judgment, following ra&s;h and
$elli&s;h Imprecations? when Men call for God's
<PB N="218" REF="234">
Judgment; and Providence, or Ju&s;tice, rather
obeys the Summons and comes at their call: A
Man calls God to Witne&s;s to an Untruth, and
wi&s;hes him&s;elf &s;truck dumb; blind, or dead if it
is not true; and is &s;truck dumb; blind, or dead;
is not this a Voice, does not Heaven with the
Stroke, cry, <HI>Ca&s;tigo te, Be it to thee as thou ha&s;t
&s;aid:</HI> He mu&s;t be deaf who cannot hear i$$, and
wor&s;e than deaf that does not heed it; &s;uch Exe|cutions
from Heaven are <HI>in Terrorem,</HI> as Offenders
among Men are puni&s;hed as well for Example to
others, as to prevent their doing the like again.</P>
<P>Innumerable Ways the merciful Di&s;po&s;ition of
Providence takes to di&s;cover to us, what he ex|pects
we &s;hould do in difficult Ca&s;es, and doubtle&s;s
then, it expects at the &s;ame Time we &s;hould take
Notice of tho&s;e Directions.</P>
<P>We are &s;hort-&s;ighted Creatures at be&s;t, and can
&s;ee but a little Way before us, I mean as to the E|vents
of Things; we ought therefore to make u&s;e
of all the Lights and Helps we can get; the&s;e if
nicely regarded, would be &s;ome of the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable
to guide us in many difficult Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Would we carefully li&s;ten to the Concurrence
of Providence, in the &s;everal Parts of our Lives,
we &s;hould &s;tand in le&s;s need of the more dange|rous
Helps of Vi&s;ions, Dreams, and Voices,
from le&s;s certain Intelligences.</P>
<P>A Gentleman of my Acquaintance, being to
go a Journey into the North, was twice ta|ken
very ill the Day he had appointed to begin his
Journey, and &s;o was oblig'd to put off going; this he
took for a Direction from Heaven, that he &s;hould
not go at all; and in very few Days after, his Wife
was taken &s;ick and died, which made it ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary for him, to be at Home, to look after
<PB N="219" REF="235">
his Affairs, and had he gone away before, mu&s;t
certainly have been obliged to come back again.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans</HI> had certainly the Foundation of
this Principle, in their prudent Ob&s;ervation of
Days and Circum&s;tances of Days; nor is Scrip|ture
it &s;elf void of the like, but rather points out
to the Ob&s;ervation, particularly that of the Chil|dren
of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> who after 430 Years were expired
from their coming into <HI>Egypt, Even in the &s;elf|&s;ame
Day departed they thence,</HI> Exod. 12, 41, 42.
This is the Day, that remarkable Day, &s;everal
other Scriptures mention periodical Times, <HI>dies
Infau&s;tus,</HI> the Prudent &s;hall keep Silence in that
Time; for it is <HI>an evil Time.</HI></P>
<P>We find Providence &s;toops to re&s;train not the A|ctions
of Men only, but even its own Actions to Days
and Times; doubtle&s;s for our Ob&s;ervation, and in
&s;ome Things for our In&s;truction; I do not
&s;o much refer to the Revolutions of Things and
Families on particular Days, which are there|fore
by &s;ome People called lucky and unlucky
Days, as I do to the ob&s;erving, how Providence
cau&s;es the Revolutions of Days, to form a
Concurrence between the Actions of Men, which
it does not approve or does approve, and the Re|ward
of the&s;e Actions in this World; by which
Men may if they think fit to di&s;tingui&s;h, and ob|&s;erve
right upon them, &s;ee the Crime or Merit
of tho&s;e Actions in the divine Re&s;entment, may
read the Sin in the Puni&s;hment, and may learn
Conviction from the Revolution of Circum&s;tances
in the Appointment of Heaven.</P>
<P>I have &s;een &s;everal Collections of &s;uch Things
made by private Hands, &s;ome relating to Family
Circum&s;tances, &s;ome to Public; al&s;o in the unnatural
Wars in <HI>England,</HI> between the King and the Parlia|ment,
I have heard many &s;uch things have been ob|erv'd:
<PB N="220" REF="236">
For Example, the &s;ame Day of the Year
and Month, that Sir <HI>John Hotham</HI> kept out <HI>Hull</HI> a|gain&s;t
King <HI>Charles</HI> the 1&s;t, and refu&s;ed him En|trance,
was the &s;ame Sir <HI>John Hotham</HI> put to
Death, by the very Parliament that he did that
Exploit for; that King <HI>Charles</HI> him&s;elf was
&s;entenced to die, by the high Court of Ju&s;tice, as
it was then called, the &s;ame Day of the Month,
that he &s;ign'd the Warrant for the Execution of
the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> which as it was then &s;aid by
&s;ome of his Friends, was cutting off his own
Right-hand. The &s;ame Day that King <HI>James</HI>
the 2d came to the Crown again&s;t the De&s;ign of
the Bill of Exclu&s;ion, the &s;ame Day he was voted
Abdicated by Parliament, and the Throne fill'd
with the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and his Prince&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e, or &s;uch as the&s;e, &s;eem to be a kind of
&s;ilent Sentence of Providence upon &s;uch Actions,
animadverting upon them in a judicial Manner,
and intimating plainly, that the Animadver&s;ion
had a retro&s;pect to what was pa&s;&s;ed, and tho&s;e

Things, &s;hould at lea&s;t lay them up in their
Hearts.</P>
<P>Eminent Deliverances in &s;udden Dangers are of
the mo&s;t &s;ignificant kind of Providences, and
which accordingly have a loud Voice in them,
calling upon us to be thankful, to that ble&s;&s;ed
Hand, that has been plea&s;ed to &s;pare and protect
us. The Voice of &s;uch &s;ignal Deliverances, is
frequently a ju&s;t Call upon us to Repentance
and looks directly that Way; often 'tis a Caution
again&s;t falling into the like Dangers we were ex|po&s;ed
to, from which nothing but &s;o much Good|ne&s;s
could deliver us again. In how many Occa|&s;ions
of Life, if God's Providence had no greater
$word$ in our Safety than our own Prudence,
<PB N="221" REF="237">
&s;hould we plunge and precipitate our &s;elves into
all manner of Mi&s;ery and Di&s;tre&s;s? and how of|ten
for want of li&s;tening to tho&s;e Providences do
we mi&s;carry?</P>
<P>Innumerable In&s;tances pre&s;ent them&s;elves to us
every Day, in which the Providence of God &s;peaks
to us, in Things relating to our&s;elves; in Delive|rances
to excite our Thankfulne&s;s, in Views of
Dangers to awaken our Caution, and to make us
walk wi&s;ely and circum&s;pectly in every Step we
take; tho&s;e that are awake to the&s;e Things, and
have their Ears open to the Voice of them, many
Times reap the Benefit of their In&s;truction by
being protected, while tho&s;e who neglect them,
are of the Number of the Simple, who pa&s;s on
and are puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>To be utterly carele&s;s of our&s;elves in &s;uch Ca&s;es,
and talk of tru&s;ting Providence, is a Lethargy of
the wor&s;t Nature; for as we are to tru&s;t Provi|dence
with our E&s;tates, but to u&s;e at the &s;ame
Time, all Diligence in our Callings; &s;o we
are to tru&s;t Providence with our Safety, but
with our Eyes open to all its nece&s;&s;ary Cautions,
Warnings, and In&s;tructions; many of which Provi|dence
is plea&s;ed to give us in the Cour&s;e of Life, for
the Direction of our Conduct, and which we &s;hould
ill place to the Account of Providence, without ac|knowledging
that they ought to be regarded, and
a due Reverence paid to them upon all Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>I take a general Neglect of the&s;e Things, to
be a kind of practical Athei&s;m, or at lea&s;t a living
in a kind of Contempt of Heaven, regardle&s;s of
all that Share, which his invi&s;ible Hand has in the
Things that befal us.</P>
<P>Such a Man receives good at the Hand of his
Maker, but unconcerned at the very Nature or
Original of it, looks not at all to the Benefactor:
<PB N="222" REF="238">
Again, he receives Evil, but has no Sen&s;e of it, as
a judicial di&s;pen&s;ing of Puni&s;hment from Heaven;
but in&s;en&s;ible of one or other, he is neither thank|ful
for one, not humble under the other, but &s;tupid
in both, as if he was out of God's Care, and God
him&s;elf out of his Thoughts; this is ju&s;t the re|ver&s;e
of the Temper I am recommending, and let
the Picture recommend it &s;elf to any according to
its Merit.</P>
<P>When Prince <HI>Vandemont</HI> commanded the confe|derate
Army in <HI>Flanders,</HI> the &s;ame Campaign that
King <HI>William</HI> was be&s;eiging <HI>Namure,</HI> &s;ome Troops
were order'd to march into the $$at Country to|wards
<HI>Newport,</HI> in Order to make a Diver&s;ion,
and draw down the Count <HI>de Montal,</HI> who com|manded
a flying Body about <HI>Menin,</HI> and to keep
him from joyning the Duke <HI>de Villeroy,</HI> who com|manded
the main Body of the <HI>French</HI> Army.</P>
<P>The Soldiers were order'd upon Pain of Death
not to &s;tir from their Camp, or to plunder any of
the Country People; the Rea&s;on was evident,
becau&s;e Provi&s;ions being &s;omewhat &s;carce, if the
Boors were not protected they would have fled
from their Hou&s;es, and the Army would have
been put to great Straits, being ju&s;t entred into the
Enemies Country.</P>
<P>It happened that five <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Soldiers &s;traggling
beyond their Bounds were fallen upon, near a
Farm-Hou&s;e, by &s;ome of the Country People (for
indeed the Boors were oftentimes too unmerciful
to the Soldiers) as if they had plunder'd them,
when indeed they had not: The Soldiers de|fended
them&s;elves, got the better, and kill'd two
of the Boors; and being, as they thought, ju&s;tly
provok'd by being fir&s;t attack'd, they broke into
the Hou&s;e, and then u&s;ed them roughly enough
indeed.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="239">
They found in the Hou&s;e a great Quantity of
Apples, the People being fled had left them in
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and they made no Ha&s;te to go away,
but fell to work with the Apples; and heating the
Oven put a great Quantity of Apples into the
Oven to roa&s;t. In the mean Time the Boors,
who knew their Number to be but five, and had
got more Help on their Side, came down upon
them again, attack'd the Hou&s;e, forced their Way
in, ma&s;ter'd the <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> kill'd two, and took
a third, and barbarou&s;ly put him into the Oven,
which he had heated, where he was &s;mother'd to
Death; it &s;eems it was not hot enough to burn
him.</P>
<P>The other two e&s;caped, but in coming back to
the Camp, they were immediately apprehended
by the Provo&s;ts, and brought to a Court Martial,
where they were &s;entenc'd not for Plundering, for
that did not appear, but for being out of the
Bounds appointed by the general Order, as a|bove.</P>
<P>When the Sentence came to be executed, the
General was prevail'd upon to &s;pare one of them,
and to order them to ca&s;t Lots for their Lives.
This, as it is known is u&s;ually done by throwing
Dice upon a Drumhead; and he that throws
highe&s;t or lowe&s;t, as is appointed before is to
die; at this time he that threw lowe&s;t was to
live.</P>
<P>When the Fellows were brought out to throw,
the fir&s;t threw two Sixes, and fell immediately
to wringing his Hands, crying he was a dead
Man; but was as much &s;urpriz'd with Joy, when
his Comrade throwing, there came up two Sixes
al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="240">
The Officer appointed to &s;ee Execution was a
little doubtful what to do, but his Orders being
po&s;itive, he commanded them to throw again;
they did &s;o, and each of them threw two Fives;
the Soldiers that &s;tood round &s;houted, and &s;aid
neither of them was to die: The Officer being a
&s;ober thinking Man, &s;aid it was &s;trange, and
look'd like &s;omething from Heaven, and he would
not proceed without acquainting the Council of
War, which was then &s;itting; they con&s;ider'd a
while, and at la&s;t order'd them to take other Dice
and to throw again, which was done, and both
the Soldiers threw two Fours.</P>
<P>The Officer goes back to the Council of War,
who were &s;urpriz'd very much, and looking on it
as the Voice of Heaven, re&s;pited the Execution
till the General was acquainted with it.</P>
<P>The General &s;ends for the Men and examines
them &s;trictly, who telling him the whole Story, he
pardon'd them with this Expre&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e about
him, <HI>I love,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>in &s;uch extraordinary Ca&s;es to
li&s;ten to the Voice of Providence.</HI></P>
<P>While we are in this un-inform'd State, where
we know &s;o little of the invi&s;ible World, it would
be greatly our Advantage, if we knew rightly,
and without the Bondage of Enthu&s;ia&s;m and Su|per&s;tition,
how to make u&s;e of the Hints given
us from above, for our Direction in Matters of
the greate&s;t Importance.</P>
<P>It has plea&s;ed God very much to &s;treighten the
&s;pecial and particular Directions, which he gives
to Men immediately from him&s;elf; but I dare not
&s;ay, they are quite cea&s;ed; we read of many Ex|amples
in Scripture, how God &s;pake to Men by
Voice immediately from Heaven, by Appearance
of Angels, or by Dreams and Vi&s;ions of the
Night, and by all the&s;e not in Public and more
<PB N="225" REF="241">
extraordinary Ca&s;es only, but in private, per&s;onal,
and family Concerns.</P>
<P>Thus God is &s;aid to have appeared to <HI>Abraham,</HI>
to <HI>Lot,</HI> and to <HI>Jacob;</HI> Angels al&s;o have appeared
in many other Ca&s;es, and to many &s;everal Per&s;ons,
as to <HI>Manoah,</HI> and his Wife, to <HI>Zachariah,</HI> to the
Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and to the <HI>Apo&s;tles;</HI> others have
been warned in a Dream, as King <HI>Abimelech,</HI> the
fal&s;e Prophet <HI>Balaam, Pontius Pilate</HI>'s Wife, <HI>Herod,
Jo&s;eph,</HI> the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> al&s;o, and many others.</P>
<P>We cannot &s;ay, but the&s;e and all the miracu|lous
Voices, the prophetic Me&s;&s;ages prefac'd
boldly by the Anc$$ents, with <HI>thus &s;aith the Lord</HI>
are ceas'd, and as we have <HI>a more &s;ure Word of
Prophe&s;y</HI> handed to us by the Mi&s;&s;ion of Go&s;pel
Mini&s;ters; to which the Scripture &s;ays, <HI>We
do well that we take heed;</HI> and to whom our
ble&s;&s;ed Lord has &s;aid, <HI>Lo, I am with you to the End
of the World:</HI> I &s;ay, as we have this Go&s;pel back'd
with the Spirit and Prefence of God, we are no
Lo&s;ers, if we ob&s;erve the Rule laid down, <HI>viz.
that we be obedient to the heavenly Vi&s;ion,</HI> for
&s;uch it is, as well as that of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI>'s
Dream of the Sheet let down from Heaven.</P>
<P>I mention this to pay a due Reverence to the
Sufficiency of Go&s;pel Revelation, and to the
guiding of the Spirit of God, who in &s;piritual
Things is given to <HI>lead us into all Truth,</HI> nor
would I have any Thing, which I am going to
&s;ay, tend to le&s;&s;en the&s;e great Efficients of our
eternal Salvation.</P>
<P>But I am chiefly upon our Conduct in the infe|rior
Life, as I may call it; and in this, I think,
the Voice of God, even his immediate Voicefrom
Heaven, is not entirely cea&s;ed from us, though it
may have changed the Mediums of Communica|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="242">
I have heard the Divines tell us by Way of Di|&s;tinction,
that there is a Voice of God in his
Word, and a Voice of God in his Work; the
latter I take to be a &s;ubject very awful and very
in&s;tructing.</P>
<P>This Voice of God in his Works, is either
heard in his Works which are already wrought,
&s;uch as of Creation, $which fill us with Wonder
and A&s;ton$&s;hment, Admiration and Adoration;
<HI>When I view the Heavens, the Work of thy Hands,
the Moon and the Stars which thon ha&s;t made, then I
&s;ay, What is Man,</HI> &amp;c. Or 2. His Works of Go|vernment
and Providence, in which the infinite
Variety affords a plea&s;ing and in&s;tructing Contem|plation;
and it is without Que&s;tion, our Wi&s;dom
and Advantage to &s;tudy and know them, and to
li&s;ten to the Voice of God in them: For this
li&s;tening to the Voice of Providence, is a Thing
&s;o hard to direct, and &s;o little under&s;tood, that I
find the very Thought of it is treated with Con|tempt,
even by many pious and good People,
as leading to Super&s;tition, to Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and
vain Fancies, tainted with Melancholly, and
amu&s;ing the Mind with the Vapours of the
Head.</P>
<P>It is true, an ill U&s;e may be made of the&s;e
Things, and to tye People too &s;trictly down to a
Rule, where their own Ob&s;ervation is to be the
Judge, endangers the running into many fooli&s;h
Extreams, entitling a di&s;temper'd Brain, too much
to the Expo&s;ition of the &s;ublime&s;t Things; and tack|ing
the awful Name of Providence to every fancy
of their own.</P>
<P>From Hence I think, too much proceeds the
extraordinary (Note, <HI>I &s;ay, Extraordinary</HI>) Ho|mage
paid to Omens, flying of Birds, Voices,
Noi&s;es, Predictions, and a thou&s;and fooli&s;h
<PB N="227" REF="243">
Things, in which I &s;hall endeavour to &s;tate the
Ca&s;e fairly between the Devil and Mankind: But
at pre&s;ent I need &s;ay no more here, than that they
have nothing to do with the Subject I am now
upon, or the Subject I am upon with them.</P>
<P>But as my De&s;ign is &s;erious, and I hope pious,
I &s;hall keep &s;trictly to the Expo&s;ition I give of
my own Meaning, and meddle with no other.</P>
<P>By the Voice of Providence therefore, I &s;hall
confine my&s;elf to the particular Circum&s;tances in|cident
and accident which every Man's Life is full
of, and which are in a more extraordinary man|ner,
&s;aid to be peculiar to him&s;elf or to his
Family.</P>
<P>By li&s;tening to them, I mean, making &s;uch due
Application of them to his own Circum&s;tances,
as becomes a Chri&s;tian, for Caution in his Con|duct,
and all manner of In&s;truction, receiving all
the Hints as from Heaven, returning all the
Pra$&s;e to, making all the Improvement for, and re|verencing
the Sovereignty of his Maker in every
Thing, not di&s;puting or reproaching the Ju&s;tice
of Providence; and which is the main Thing I
aim at, taking &s;uch Notice of the &s;everal Provi|dences,
that happen in the Cour&s;e of our Lives,
as by one Circum&s;tance to learn how to behave in
another.</P>
<P>For Example, &s;uppo&s;ing from my own Story,
When a young Fellow broke from his Friends,
trampled upon all the wi&s;e Advices, and mo&s;t af|fectionate
Per&s;wa&s;ions of his Father, and even the
Tears and Entreaties of a tender Mother, and
would go away to Sea; but is check'd in his fir&s;t
Excur&s;ions by being Shipwreck'd, and in the ut|mo&s;t
Di&s;tre&s;s &s;av'd by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of another
Ship's Boat, &s;eeing the Ship he was in, &s;oon after
$word$ to the Bottom; ought not &s;uch a young Man
<PB N="228" REF="244">
to have li&s;tened to the Voice of this Providence,
and have taken it for a Summons to him; that
when he was on Shore, he &s;hould &s;tay on Shore,
and go back to the Arms of his Friends, hearken
to their Council, and not precipitate him&s;elf into
farther Mi&s;chiefs; what Happine&s;s might &s;uch a
prudent Step have procured, what Mi&s;eries and
Mi&s;chiefs would it have prevented in the re&s;t of
his unfortunate Life.</P>
<P>An Acquaintance of mine, who had &s;everal &s;uch
Circum&s;tances befel him, as tho&s;e which I am in|clin'd
to call Warnings, but entirely neglected
them, and laugh'd at tho&s;e that did otherwi&s;e,
&s;uffered deeply for his di&s;-regard of Omens; he
took Lodgings in a Village near the City of <HI>Lon|den,</HI>
and in a Hou&s;e, where either he &s;ought $bad
Company, or at be&s;t could meet with little that
was good. Providence that &s;eemed to animadvert
upon his Conduct, &s;o ordered it that &s;omething
or other mi&s;chievous always happened to him
there, or as he went thither; &s;everal Times he
was robbed on the Highway going thither, once
or twice taken very ill, at other Times his Affairs
in the World went ill, while he diverted him&s;elf
there; &s;everal of his Friends caution'd him of it
and told him, he ought to con&s;ider that &s;ome &s;u|perior
Hand &s;eemed to hint to him, that he
&s;hould come there no more; he &s;lighted the Hint,
or at lea&s;t neglected it after &s;ome Time, and went
to the &s;ame Place again: But was &s;o terrified
with a mo&s;t dreadful Tempe&s;t of Thunder and
Lightning, which fell as it were more particular|ly
upon that Part of the Country than upon
others; that he took it as a Warning from Heaven,
and re&s;olv'd not to go there again, and &s;ome
Time after a Fire de&s;troyed that Hou&s;e, very few
e&s;caping that were in it.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="245">
It would be an ill Account we &s;hould give of
the Government of divine Providence in the
World, if we &s;hould argue, that its Events are &s;o
unavoidable, and every Circum&s;tance &s;o determin|ed,
that nothing can be altered; and that therefore
the&s;e Warnings of Providence are incon&s;i&s;tent with
the Nature of it. This be&s;ides that I think it
would take from the Sovereignty of Providence,
and deny even God him&s;elf the Privilege of being
a free Agent, it would al&s;o &s;o contradict the Ex|perience
of every Man living, in the Varieties of
his re&s;pective Life, that he &s;hould be unable to
give any Account for what End many Things,
which Providence directs in the World, are di|rected,
and why &s;o many Things happen which
do happen; why are Evils attending us &s;o evi|dently
foretold, that by tho&s;e Fore-tellings they are
avoided, if it was not determined before that they
&s;hould be avoided, and &s;hould not befal us?</P>
<P>People that tye up all to Events and Cau&s;es,
&s;trip the Providence of God which guides the
World of all its Superintendency, and leave it
no room to act as a wi&s;e Di&s;po&s;er of Things.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me that the immutable Wi&s;dom and
Power of the Creator, and the Notion of it in
the Minds of Men, is as dutifully pre&s;erved, and is
as legible to our Under&s;tanding, though there be
a Hand left at Liberty to direct the Cour&s;e of na|tural
Cau&s;es and Events; 'Tis &s;ufficient to the
Honour of an immutable Deity, that for the
common Incidents of Life, they be left to the
Di&s;po&s;ition of a daily Agitator, namely, divine
Providence, to order and direct them as it &s;hall &s;ee
good, within the natural Limits of Cau&s;e and
Con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="246">
This &s;eems to me a much more rational Sy&s;tem,
than that of tying up the Hands of the &s;upreme
Power to a Road of Things, &s;o that none can be
acted or permitted, but &s;uch as was &s;o appointed
before to be acted and permitted.</P>
<P>But what, if after all, we were to &s;it down and
acknowledge, that the immutability of God's
Being, and the Unchangeablene&s;s of his Actings,
are not ea&s;y to be comprehended by us, or that
we may &s;ay we are not able to reconcile them
with the infinite Variation of his Providence,
which in all its Actings &s;eems to us to be at full
Liberty to determine anew, and give Events a
turn this Way or that Way, as its Sovereignty
and Wi&s;dom, &s;hall direct; does it follow, that
the&s;e Things are not reconcileable, becau&s;e we
cannot reconcile them? why &s;hould we not as well
&s;ay, nothing of God is to be under&s;tood, becau&s;e
we cannot under&s;tand it? or that nothing in Nature
is intelligible, but what we can under&s;tand?</P>
<P>Who can under&s;tand the Rea&s;on, and much le&s;s
the Manner of the Needle tending to the Pole,
by being touch'd with the Load&s;tone, and by
what Operation the magnetic Vertue is convey|ed
with a Touch? why that Vertue is not com|municable
to other Metals, &s;uch as Gold, Silver,
or Copper, but to Iron only? what Sympathetic
Influence is there between the Stone and the
Star or the Pole? why tending to that Point in
the whole Arch, and not to any other, and why
face about to the South Pole as &s;oon as it has
pa&s;t the Equinox? yet we &s;ee all the&s;e Things
in their Operations and Events, we know
they mu&s;t be reconcileable in Nature, though we
$word$ reconcile them, and intelligible in Nature,
$word$ we cannot under&s;tand them: Sure it is
$span$ rea&s;onable then for us to believe, that
<PB N="231" REF="247">
the various Actings of Providence, which to us
appear changeable, one Decree, as it were, re|ver&s;ing
another, and one Action &s;uper&s;eding a|nother,
may be as reconcilable to the Immutabi|lity
of God, and to the Unchangeablene&s;s of his
Purpo&s;es, tho' we cannot under&s;tand, how it is
brought to pa&s;s, as it is to believe, that there is
a Rea&s;on to be given for the Agreement and &s;im|pathetick
Corre&s;pondence between the <HI>Magn t</HI> and
the <HI>Pole,</HI> tho at pre&s;ent the Manner of it is not
di&s;cover'd, and cannot be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>If then the Hand of divine Providence has a
&s;pontaneous Power of acting, and directed by its
own Sovereignty, proceeds by &s;uch Methods, as
it thinks fit, and as we &s;ee daily in the Cour&s;e
of human things: Our Bu&s;ine&s;s is to conver&s;e
with the acting Part of Providence, with which
we more immediately have to do, and not con|found
our Judgment with things which we cannot
fully comprehend, &s;uch as the Why, to what
End, and the how in what Manner, it acts &s;o
and &s;o.</P>
<P>As we are then conver&s;ant with the immediate
Actions of divine Providence, it is our Bu&s;ine&s;s to
&s;tudy it as much as may be in that Part of its
Actings, wherein it is to be known; and this in|cludes
the &s;ilent Actings of Providence, as well as
tho&s;e which are more loud, and which being de|clar'd,
&s;peak in publick.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal &s;ilent Steps, which Providence
takes in the World, which &s;ummon our Attention;
and he that will not li&s;ten to them, &s;hall deprive
him&s;elf of much of the Caution and Council, as
well as Comfort, which he might otherwi&s;e have
in his Pa&s;&s;age thro' this Life, particularly by thus
li&s;tening to the Voice, as I call it, of Providence,
we have the Comfort of &s;eeing, that really an
<PB N="232" REF="248">
invi&s;ible and powerful Hand is employ'd in, and
concern'd for our Pre&s;ervation and Pro&s;perity in
the World; And who can look upon the manife&s;t De|liverances
which he meets with in the infinite Vari|ety
of Life, without being convinc'd that they are
wrought for him without his own A&s;&s;i&s;tance, by
the wi&s;e and merciful Di&s;po&s;itions of an invi&s;ible
and friendly Power.</P>
<P>The bringing good Events to pa&s;s by the mo&s;t
threatning Cau&s;es, as it te&s;tifies a Power that has
the Government of Cau&s;es and Effects in its Hand,
&s;o it gives a very convincing Evidence of that
Power, being in good Terms with us; as on the
contrary, when the like Providence declares again&s;t
us, we ought to make a &s;uitable U&s;e of it another
Way, that is to &s;ay, take the ju&s;t Alarm, and ap|ply
to the nece&s;&s;ary Duties of Humiliation and
Repentance.</P>
<P>The&s;e things may be je&s;ted with by the Men of
Fa&s;hion; but I am &s;uppo&s;ing my&s;elf talking to
Men that have a Sen&s;e of a future State, and of
the Oeconomy of an invi&s;ible World upon them,

both.</P>

in which we may furni&s;h our &s;elves
with Directions in the Cour&s;e of Life, and in the
mo&s;t &s;udden Incidents, as well to obtain Good,
as avoid Evil.</P>
<P>Much of the Honour due to the Goodne&s;s of
Providence, is unju&s;tly taken away from it, by
Men that give them&s;elves a Loo&s;e in a general
Neglect of the&s;e things: But that which is &s;till
more ab&s;urd to me is, that &s;ome Men are ob&s;ti|nately
<PB N="233" REF="249">
re&s;olv'd again&s;t paying the Homage of their
Deliverances to their Maker, or paying the Re|verence
due to his Terrors, in any thing that be|falls
them ill, where it ought to be paid, that
they will give all that Honour to another. If it
was well, they tell you, they know not how, but
&s;o it happen'd, or it was &s;o by good Chance,
and the like. This is a Sort of Language I can|not
under&s;tand: It &s;eems to be a felonious
Thought in its very De&s;ign, robbing Heaven of
the Honour due to it, and li&s;ting our &s;elves in
the Regiment of the Ungrateful.</P>
<P>But this is not all, for one Crime leads on to a|ther,
if this Part is Felony or Robbery, the
next is Trea&s;on, for re&s;olving fir&s;t to deny the
Homage of good or evil Events to God from
who&s;e Hands they come, they go on and pay
it to the Devil, the Enemy of his Prai&s;e, and
Rival of his Power.</P>
<P>Two of the&s;e Wretches travell'd a little Journey
with me &s;ome Years ago; and in their Return,
&s;ome Time after I was gone from them, they met
with a very different Adventure, and telling me
the Story, they expre&s;s'd them&s;elves thus, <HI>They
were riding from</HI> Huntington <HI>towards</HI> London, <HI>and
in &s;ome Lanes betwixt</HI> Huntington <HI>and</HI> Caxton, <HI>one
happen'd by a Slip of his Hor&s;e's Foot, which lam'd him
a little, to &s;tay about half a Mile behind the other, was
&s;et upon by &s;ome Highway-men, who robb'd him, and
abus'd him very much; the other went on to</HI> Caxton,
<HI>not taking Care of his Companion, thinking he had &s;tay'd
on &s;ome particular Occa&s;ion, and e&s;cap'd the Thieves,
they making off cro&s;s the Country towards</HI> Cambridge.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ays I to the fir&s;t, How came you to
e&s;cape? <HI>I don't know not I,</HI> &s;ays he, I <HI>happen'd</HI> not
to look behind me, when his Hor&s;e &s;tumbl'd, and
I went forward, and <HI>by good Luck,</HI> adds he again,
<PB N="234" REF="250">
I heard nothing of the Matter; here was, <HI>it hap|pen'd,</HI>
and <HI>by good Luck,</HI> but not the lea&s;t Sen&s;e of
the Government of Providence in this Affair, or
its Di&s;po&s;ition for his Good, but an empty Idol
of Air, or rather an imaginary non&s;en&s;ical <HI>Nothing,</HI>
an Image more incon&s;i&s;tent than tho&s;e I mention'd
among the <HI>Chine&s;es;</HI> not a Mon&s;ter indeed of a
ftightful Shape, and ugly Figure, loath&s;ome and
frightful, but a meer <HI>Phanta&s;m,</HI> an Idea, a None-Entity,
a Name without being a mi&s;call'd, unborn,
nothing, hap, luck, Chance, that is to &s;ay, a Name
put upon the <HI>Medium,</HI> which they &s;et up in their
Imagination, for Want of a Will to acknowledge
their Maker, and recognize the Goodne&s;s which
had particularly pre&s;erv'd him.</P>
<P>This was the mo&s;t ungrateful Piece of Fol|ly,
or to &s;peak more properly, the madde&s;t and foo|li&s;he&s;t
Piece of Ingratitude that ever I met
with.</P>
<P>Well, if this was fooli&s;h and prepo&s;terous, the
other was as wicked and dete&s;table: For when
the fir&s;t had told his Tale, I turn'd to the other,
and ask'd him, What was the Matter? <HI>Why!
How came this to pa&s;s?</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>why this Di&s;a&s;ter has
fallen all upon you? How was it?</HI> Nay, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I
don't know, I was a little behind, and my Hor&s;e
<HI>chanc'd</HI> to &s;lip, and lame him&s;elf, and he went for|ward,
and left me; and as the Devil would have
it, the&s;e Fellows came cro&s;s the Country, and
chopt upon me, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Here was fir&s;t <HI>Chance,</HI> the &s;ame Mock-Godde&s;s,
as before, lam'd his Hor&s;e, and next, the Devil
order'd the Highway-men to chop upon him that
Moment. Now, tho' it may true, that the High|way-men
were even by their Employment doing
the Devil's Office of going to and fro, &s;eeking
whom they might plunder; yet 'twas a higher
<PB N="235" REF="251">
Hand than Satan's, that deliver'd this poor blind
Fellow into their Power.</P>
<P>We have a plain Guide for this in Scripture
Language, in the Law of Man-&s;laughter, or
Death, <HI>as the call it fooli&s;hly enough,</HI> by Mi&s;adven|ture
it is in the 21 <HI>Exod.</HI> 13. in the Ca&s;e of ca&s;ual
killing a Man, it is expre&s;s'd thus, <HI>If a Man lye
not in Wait, but God deliver him into his Hand.</HI> This
was not to be accounted Murther, but the Slayer
was to fly to the City of Refuge.</P>
<P>Here it is evident, that God takes all the&s;e
Mi&s;adventures into his own Hand; and a Man
kill'd by Accident, is a Man whom God has de|liver'd
up, for what End in his Providence is known
only to him&s;elf, to be kill'd in that Manner, per|haps
vindictively, perhaps not.</P>
<P>With what Face can any Man &s;ay, this was <HI>as
the Devil would have it,</HI> or <HI>as bad Luck would have
it,</HI> or it <HI>happen'd,</HI> or <HI>chanc'd,</HI> or <HI>fell out;</HI> all which
are our &s;imple and empty Ways of talking of things
that are order'd by the immediate Hand or Dire|ction
of God's Providence.</P>
<P>The Words la&s;t quoted from the Scripture of
<HI>God's delivering a Man into another Man's Hand to
be killed unwillingly,</HI> are fully explained in another
Place, <HI>Deut.</HI> xix. 5.</P>
<P>As when a Man goeth into the Wood with his Neigh|bour,
to hew Wood, and his Hand fetches a Stroke
with the Ax to cut down the Tree, and the Head &s;lip|peth
from the Helve, and lighteth upon his Neighbour,
that he die; he &s;hall flee unto one of tho&s;e Cities, and
live.</P>
<P>The wicked thoughtle&s;s Creature, I have ju&s;t
mentioned, who&s;e Hor&s;e fell lame, and &s;topt his
Travelling, till he might come ju&s;t in the Way of
tho&s;e Thieves, who it &s;eems were cro&s;&s;ing the
Country, perhaps upon &s;ome other Exploit, ought
<PB N="236" REF="252">
to have reflected, that Providence, to cha&s;ti&s;e
him, and bring him to a Sen&s;e of his Dependance
upon, and being &s;ubjected to his Power, had di|rected
him to be &s;eparated from his Companion,
that he might fall into the Hands that robb'd and
abus'd him; and the other had no le&s;s Obliga|tion
to give Thanks for his Deliverance: But how
contrary they acted in both Ca&s;es, you have
heard.</P>
<P>We have had abundance of Collections, in my
Remembrance, of remarkable Providences, as they
are call'd; and many People are forward to call
them &s;o: But this does not come up to the Ca&s;e
in Hand.</P>
<P>Tho' contemning Providence, and giving the
Homage due to it, as above, to the Devil, or to
Chance, Fate, and I know not what Embrio's of
the Fancy are impious; yet every one that avoids
this Evil, does not come up to the particular Point
I am &s;peaking of; for there is a manife&s;t Diffe|rence
between acknowledging the Being and Ope|rations
of Providence, and <HI>li&s;tning to its Voice,</HI> as
many People acknowledge a God, that obey none
of his Commands, and concern them&s;elves in no|thing
of their Duty to him.</P>
<P>To li&s;ten to the Voice of Providence, is to take
&s;trict Notice of all the remarkable Steps of Provi|dence,
which relate to us in particular, to ob&s;erve,
if there is nothing in them in&s;tructing to our Con|duct;
no Warning to us for avoiding &s;ome Dan|ger;
no Direction for the taking &s;ome particular
Steps for our Safety or Advantage; no Hint to re|mind
us of &s;uch and &s;uch things <HI>omitted;</HI> no Con|viction
of &s;omething <HI>committed;</HI> no vindictive
Step, by Way of Retaliation, marking out the
Crime in the Puni&s;hment; You may ea&s;ily ob|&s;erve
the Differences between the Directions and
<PB N="237" REF="253">
Warnings of Providence, when duly li&s;tned to,
and the Notices of Spirits from an invi&s;ible
World, <HI>viz.</HI> that the&s;e are dark Hints of Evil, with
very little Direction to avoid it: But tho&s;e Noti|ces,
which are to be taken from the Proceedings
of Providence, tho' the Voice be a Kind of &s;ilent
or &s;oft Whi&s;per; yet 'tis generally attended with
an Offer of the Means for e&s;caping the Evil, nay,
very often leads by the Hand to the very proper
Steps to be taken; and even obliges us, by a &s;trong
Conviction of the Rea&s;on of it, to take tho&s;e
Steps.</P>
<P>It is in vain for me to run into a Collection of
Stories; for Example, where the Variety is infinite,
and things vary as every particular Man's Circum|&s;tances
vary: But as every Event in the World is
manag'd by the Superintendency of Providence; &s;o
every Providence has in it &s;ome thing in&s;tructing,
&s;ome thing that calls upon us to look up, or look
out, or look in.</P>
<P>Every one of tho&s;e Heads are big with particu|lar
Explanations; but my Bu&s;ine&s;s is not Preach|ing;
I am making Ob&s;ervations and Reflections,
let tho&s;e make Enlargements who read it: In a Word,
there is &s;carce any particular Providence attends
our Lives, but we &s;hall find, if we give due
Weight to it, that it calls upon us, either.</P>

of God in &s;paring us, the Bounty of God in

under the Ju&s;tice of God, in being angry

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Proportion between the Chri|&s;tian
and Pagan World.</HEAD>
<P>_I Have &s;aid &s;omething of this al|ready
in my Enquiry after the
State of Religion in the World;
but upon &s;ome Reflections which
fell in my Way &s;ince, I think it
may offer further Thoughts, very
improving, as well as diverting.</P>
<P>When we view the World geographically,
take the Plan of the Globe, and mea&s;ure it by
Line, and cut it out into Latitude and Longitude,
Degrees, Leagues, and Miles; we may &s;ee indeed
that a pretty large Spot of the whole, is at pre|&s;ent
under the Government of Chri&s;tian Powers
and Princes, or under the Influence of their Power
and Commerce, by Arms, Navies, Colonies, and
Plantations; or their Factories, Mi&s;&s;ionaries, Re&s;i|dences,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But I am loth to &s;ay we &s;hould take this for a
Fulfilling the Promi&s;e made to the Me&s;&s;iah, that
his Kingdom &s;hould be exalted above all Nations,
and the Go&s;pel be heard to the End of the Earth,
I was going to &s;ay, <HI>and yet without any Prophane|&s;s;</HI>
that we hope God will not <HI>put in off</HI> S O.
I mu&s;t acknowledge, I expect in the Fulfilling of
the&s;e Promi&s;es, that the Time will come, <HI>when the
<PB N="240" REF="256">
Knowledge of God &s;hall cover the Earth, as the Waters
$over the Sea,</HI> that the Church of God &s;hall be &s;et
open to the four Winds, <HI>that the Mountain of the
Lords Hou&s;e &s;hall be exalted above the Tops of the
Mountains, and all the Nations &s;hall flow into it,</HI> I&s;a.
ii. 2. that is to &s;ay, that the Chri&s;tian Religion,
or the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Doctrine of the MESSIAH,
&s;hall be made national over the whole Globe, ac|cording
to tho&s;e Words, <HI>Matth.</HI> xxiv. 14. <HI>Mark</HI> xiii.
13. <HI>Luke</HI> xxiv. 17. But this may be a little too
apocalyptical, or vi&s;ionary for the Times; and 'tis
no Bu&s;ine&s;s of mine, to enter upon the Interpre|tation
of Scripture Difficulties, whatever I may
under&s;tand, or believe my &s;elf about them; but
rather to make my Ob&s;ervations, as I have be|gun,
upon things which now are, and which we
have &s;een and know, let what is to come, be as he
plea&s;es, who has ordered things pa&s;t, and knows
what is to follow.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Ca&s;e is, to &s;peak of the mathema|tical
Proportion that there is now to be ob&s;erved
upon the Plain of the Globe, and ob&s;erve how
&s;mall a Part of the World it is, where the Chri|&s;tian
Religion has really prevail'd, and is natio|nally
profe&s;s'd, I &s;peak of the Chri&s;tian Religion,
where it is, as I call it, National, <HI>that is,</HI> in its
utmo&s;t Latitude; and I do &s;o, that I may give
the utmo&s;t Advantage, even again&s;t my &s;elf, in
what I am going to &s;ay; and therefore, when I
come to make Deductions for the Mixtures of bar|barous
Nations, I &s;hall do it fairly al&s;o.</P>
<P>I have nothing to do with the Di&s;tinctions of
Chri&s;tians: I hope none will object again&s;t calling
the Roman Church, a Chri&s;tian Church, in this
Re&s;pect, and the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Popi&s;h Church,
<HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> neither do I &s;cruple to call the Greek
Church <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> tho' in &s;ome Places &s;o blended

of his Per&s;on, Nature, and Dignity; or of the
Homage due to him as the Redeemer of the

upon the Coa&s;t from the Latitude of 32

Miles in Length; but then much of this is very
thinly-peopled, and the Breadth they lye <HI>We&s;t</HI>
into the Country is little or nothing, 50 Miles

<P>So that all this planting though &s;o con&s;iderable,
amounts to no more compared to the Country it|&s;elf,

Continent with the Northern Part of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI>
or &s;o near joining, as to be only parted by a nar|row
Gulph and Streight of Sea, ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;ed over
both by Man or Bea&s;t, or el&s;e it would be hard
to give an Account how Man or Bea&s;t came into
that Part of the World; I &s;ay, this va&s;t Conti|nent
full of People, and no doubt, inhabited by
many Millions of Souls, is all wrapt up in Idola|try
and Pagani&s;m, given up to Ignorance and
Blindne&s;s, wor&s;hipping the Sun, the Moon, the
Fire, the Hills their Fathers, and in a Word the
Devil.</P>
<P>As to the Thing we call Religion, or the Know|ledge
of the true God, much le&s;s the Doctrine of
<PB N="247" REF="263">
the Me&s;&s;iah, and the Name of Chri&s;t, they not
only have not, but never had the lea&s;t Intimation of
it on Earth, or Revelation of it from Heaven,
till the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came among them: Nay,
and now Chri&s;tians are come among them,
'tis hard to &s;ay, whether the Pagani&s;m is
much abated, except by the infinite Ravages the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> made where they came, who rooted
out the Idolatry by de&s;troying the Idolaters, not
by converting them; having cruelly cut off, as
their own Writers affirm, above &s;eventy Millions
of People, and left the Country naked of its In|habitants
for many hundred Miles together.</P>
<P>But what need we come to Calculations for the
pre&s;ent Time with Re&s;pect to <HI>America,</HI> let us but
be at the Trouble to look back a little more than
a Hundred Years, which is as nothing at all in the
Argument; how had the whole Continent of <HI>A|merica</HI>
extended almo&s;t from Pole to Pole, with
all the I&s;lands round it, and peopled with &s;uch innu|merable
Multitudes of People, been as it were en|tirely
abandoned to the Devil's Government, even
from the beginning of Time, or at lea&s;t from the
&s;econd Peopling the World by <HI>Noah</HI> to the 16th
Century, when <HI>Ferdinando Cortez,</HI> General for the
famous <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th, fir&s;t landed in the Gulph
of <HI>Mexico?</HI></P>
<P>We have heard much of the Cruelty of the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
in de&s;troying &s;uch Multitudes of the Inha|bitants
there, and of cutting off whole Nations
by Fire and Sword: But as I am for giving up
all the Actions of Men to the Government of Pro|vidence,
it &s;eems to me, that Heaven had
determined &s;uch an Act of Vengeance &s;hould
be executed, and of which the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
were In&s;truments, to de&s;troy tho&s;e People, who
were come up (by the Influence of the Devil, no
<PB N="248" REF="264">
Doubt) to &s;uch a dreadful height, in that abhorr'd
Cu&s;tom of human Sacrifices, that the innocent
Blood cried for it, and it &s;eemed to be a Time to put
a Stop to that Crime, le&s;t the very Race of People
&s;hould at la&s;t be extinct by their own Butcheries.</P>
<P>The Magnitude of this may be gue&s;&s;ed at, by
the Temple con&s;ecrated to the great Idol of
<HI>Vi&s;$lip$&s;tli</HI> in the City of <HI>Mexico,</HI> where at the
Command of <HI>Montezuma</HI> the Pagan Monarch,
twenty thou&s;and Men were &s;acrificed in a Year,
and the Wall hung a Foot thick with clotted
Blood, da&s;hed in Ceremony again&s;t the Side of
that Place on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>This Abomination God in his Providence, put
an End to, by de&s;troying tho&s;e Nations from the
Face of the Earth, bringing a Race of bearded
Strangers upon them, cutting in Pieces Man, Wo|man
and Child, de&s;troying their Idols, and even the
Idolatry it &s;elf by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> who, however
wicked in them&s;elves, yet were in this to be
e&s;teemed In&s;truments in the Hand of Heaven, to
execute the divine Ju&s;tice, on Nations, who&s;e
Crimes were come up to a full Height, and that
call'd for Vengeance.</P>
<P>I make no doubt (to carry on this Digre&s;&s;ion a
little farther) that when God ca&s;t out the Hea|then,
&s;o the Scripture calls it, from before the
<HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> and the Iniquity of the People of the
Land was full, <HI>Jo&s;hua, Mo&s;es,</HI> and the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI>
were tax'd with as much Cruelty and Inhumanity,
in de&s;troying the Cities, killing Man, Woman,
and Child; nay, even de&s;troying the very Cattle,
and Trees, and Fruits of the Earth, as ever the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> were charg'd with in the Conque&s;t of
<HI>Mexico.</HI></P>
<P>This is apparent by the Terror that was &s;pread
upon the Minds o$ the People $ound about them,
<PB N="249" REF="265">
whereof thou&s;ands fled to other Parts of the
World. That Hi&s;tory tells us, that the fir&s;t
Builders of the City of <HI>Carthage,</HI> long before the
<HI>Roman</HI> Times, or before the Fable of Queen <HI>Dido,</HI>
were &s;ome <HI>Phenicians,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Canaanites,</HI>
who flying for their Lives, got Ships and went
away to Sea, planting them&s;elves on the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Africk,</HI> as the fir&s;t Place of Safety they arriv'd at,
and to prove this a Pillar of Stone, was found not
far from <HI>Tripoli,</HI> on which was cut in <HI>Phenician</HI>
Characters, the&s;e Words, <HI>We are of tho&s;e who fled
from the Face of</HI> Jo&s;hua <HI>the Robber.</HI></P>
<P>The Cruelties of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> in de&s;troying
the Nations of the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> was com|manded
from Heaven; and therein <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> was
ju&s;tify'd in what was done. The Cruelties of the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> however abhorr'd by us, was doubtle&s;s
an Appointment of God, for the De&s;truction of the
wickede&s;t and mo&s;t abominable People upon
Earth.</P>
<P>But this is all a Digre&s;&s;ion; I come to my Cal|culation:
It is true, that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom I
allow to be Chri&s;tians, have po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Empires
of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru:</HI> But after all the Havock
they made, and the Millions of Souls they di&s;|mi&s;s'd
out of Life there, yet the Natives are in|finitely
the Majority of the Inhabitants; and tho'
many of them are chri&s;tianiz'd, they are little more
than &s;ubjected, and take all the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> Chri&s;ti|ans,
and all the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> in the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> all the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> in the <HI>North,</HI> and in a Word, all
the Chri&s;tians in <HI>America,</HI> and put them together,
they will not ballance one Part of the Pagans or
Mahometans in <HI>Europe:</HI> For Example, Take the
<HI>Crim Tartars</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> who inhabit the Bank of
the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea, they are more in Number than all
the Chri&s;tians in <HI>America;</HI> &s;o that &s;etting one Na|tion
<PB N="250" REF="266">
again&s;t the other, and you may reckon that
there is not one Chri&s;tian, or as if there were not
one Chri&s;tian in tho&s;e three Parts of the World, <HI>A&s;ia,
Africa,</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> except the <HI>Greeks</HI> of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>This is a ju&s;t but a very &s;ad Account of the
&s;mall Extent of Chri&s;tian Knowledge in the
World; and were it con&s;ider'd, as it ought, would
put the mo&s;t powerful Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> upon
thinking of &s;ome Methods, at lea&s;t to open a Way
for the &s;preading Chri&s;tian Knowledge. I am
not much of the Opinion indeed, that Religion
&s;hould be planted by the Sword: But as the Chri|&s;tian
Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> however few in Number,
are yet &s;o &s;uperior to all the re&s;t of the World in
martial Experience and the Art of War, nothing
is more certain than that, if they could unite their
Intere&s;t, they are able to beat Pagani&s;m out of the
World. Nothing is more certain than this, that
would the Chri&s;tian Princes unite their Powers, and
act in Concert, they might de&s;troy the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Em|pire,
and the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Kingdom, and beat the very
Name of Mahomet out of the World.</P>
<P>It is no Boa&s;t to &s;ay, That were there no inte|&s;tine
Broils among us, the Chri&s;tian Soldiery is
&s;o evidently &s;uperior to the <HI>Turks</HI> at this Time,
that had they all join'd after the late Battel at
<HI>Belgrade,</HI> to have &s;ent 80000 <HI>Veteran</HI> Soldiers to
have join'd Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> and &s;upply'd him with
Money and Provi&s;ions by the Ports of the <HI>Adriatic</HI>
Gulph, and the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> that Prince would in
two or three Campaigns, have driven the Ma|hometans
out of <HI>Europe,</HI> taken <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and
have overturn'd the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>After &s;uch a Conque&s;t, whether might not the
Chri&s;tian Religion have &s;pread? The King of <HI>Spain</HI>
with the &s;ame Ea&s;e would reduce the Moors
of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e Sons of Hell the
<PB N="251" REF="267">
<HI>Algerines, Tripolines, Tunizeens,</HI> and all the Maho|metan
Pyrates of that Coa&s;t, and plant again
the antient Churches of <HI>Africk,</HI> the Sees of <HI>Tertulli|an,</HI>
St. <HI>Cyprian, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, even the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> an enterprizing
and glorious Prince, well a&s;&s;i&s;ted and &s;upported by
his Neighbours, the Northern Powers, who to|gether
are Ma&s;ters of the be&s;t Soldiery in the
World, would not find it impo&s;&s;ible to march an
Army of 36000 Foot and 16000 Hor&s;e, in Spite
of wa&s;te and unho&s;pitable De&s;arts, even to attack
the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Empire; who, notwith&s;tanding their
infinite Numbers, pretended Policy and great
Skill in War, would &s;ink in the Operation: And
&s;uch an Army of di&s;ciplin'd <HI>European</HI> Soldiers,
would beat all the Forces of that va&s;t Empire, with
the &s;ame (or greater) Ea&s;e, as <HI>Alexander</HI> with
30000 <HI>Macedonians</HI> de&s;troy'd the Army of <HI>Darius,</HI>
which con&s;i&s;ted of 680000 Men.</P>
<P>And let no Man ridicule this Project, on Ac|count
of the March which I know they will call
3000 Miles and more: While there is no Ob&s;tru|ction,
but the Length of the Way, it is not &s;o
difficult as &s;ome may imagine; 'tis far from im|po&s;&s;ible,
to furni&s;h &s;ufficient Provi&s;ions for the
March, which is indeed the only Difficulty that
carries any Terror in it.</P>
<P>Such a Prince as the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> cannot
want the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of innumerable Hands, for the
Ama&s;&s;ing or Carriage for conveying to proper Ma|gazines,
&s;ufficient Stores of Provi&s;ions, for the
maintaining a &s;elect cho&s;en Body of Men to march
over the De&s;arts; for in the grand March, no
u&s;ele&s;s Mouths &s;hould be found to feed.</P>
<P>Why then &s;hould not the Chri&s;tian Princes think
it a Deed of Compa&s;&s;ion to the Souls of Men, as
well as an humble Agency to the Work of Provi|dence,
<PB N="252" REF="268">
and to the Fulfilling the Promi&s;es of their
Saviour, by a moderate, and as far as in them lyes,
a bloodle&s;s Conque&s;t, to reduce the whole World
to the Government of Chri&s;tian Power, and &s;o
plant the Name and Knowledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us
among the Heathens and Mahometans? I am not
&s;uppo&s;ing, that they can plant real Religion in
this manner; the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Power, is to open
the Way to the Go&s;pel of Peace, the Servants of
the King of the Earth are to fight, that the Ser|vants
of the King of Heaven may preach.</P>
<P>Let but an open Door be made for the preach|ing
of the Word of God, and the Mini&s;ters of
Chri&s;t be admitted, if they do not &s;pread Chri&s;ti|an
Knowledge over the Face of the Earth, the
Fault will be their's. Let but the military Power
reduce the Pagan World, and bani&s;h the Devil and
Mahomet from the Face of the Earth, the Know|ledge
of God be diligently &s;pread, the Word of God
duly preach'd, and the People meekly and faith|fully
in&s;tructed in the Chri&s;tian Religion; the
World would &s;oon receive the Truth, and the
Knowledge of divine Things would be the Study
and Delight of Mankind.</P>
<P>I know, &s;ome nice and difficult People would
object here, how are the pre&s;ent Body of Chri&s;ti|ans,
<HI>as you call them,</HI> qualified to convert the Pa|gan
and Mahometan World, when they are not
able to &s;ettle the main Point, <HI>viz.</HI> What the Chri|&s;tian
Religion is, Or, what they would convert
them to? That Chri&s;tianity is &s;ubdivided into &s;o
many Parts, and particular Principles, the People &s;o
divided in their Opinion; and that which is &s;till
wor&s;e, there is &s;o little Charity among the &s;everal
Sorts, that &s;ome of them would rather &s;ide with
<HI>Mahomet</HI> again&s;t their Neighbours, than a&s;&s;i&s;t to pro|pagate
that particular Doctrine in Religion, which
<PB N="253" REF="269">
they condemn. Thus the Members of the Prote|&s;tant
Faith would make it a Point of Principle,
not to &s;upporr or propagate the Intere&s;t of Popery
in &s;uch a Conque&s;t as this: And again, the Ca|tholicks
would as much make it a Duty on
them to root out Here&s;y, &s;o they call the Prote|&s;tant
<HI>Doctrine,</HI> as they would to root out Pagani&s;m
and the Wor&s;hip of Devils.</P>
<P>I would not an&s;wer for &s;ome Prote&s;tants, that
they would not be of the &s;ame Mind as to particu|lar
Divi&s;ions among Prote&s;tants: The Difference
among &s;ome Opinions is &s;uch, and their Want
of Charity one to another, &s;ets them at &s;uch Va|riance,
that if they do not cen&s;ure one another for
Devil-Wor&s;hippers, yet we know they frequently
call &s;ome of the oppo&s;ite Principles, Doctrines of
Devils; and per&s;ecute one another with as much
Fury, as ever the Heathen per&s;ecuted the Primi|tive
Churches.</P>
<P>Witne&s;s the Violences which have reign'd be|tween
the Epi&s;copal and Presbyterian Parties, in the
North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which has &s;o
often broken out into a Flame of War, and that
Flame been always quench'd with Blood.</P>
<P>Witne&s;s the frequent Per&s;ecutions, Wars, Ma&s;|&s;acres,
and other cruel and unnatural Doings,
which have been in the&s;e Parts of the World among
Chri&s;tians, the Effect of a mi&s;taken Zeal for the
Chri&s;tian Religion; which as it was not planted
by Blood and Violence, &s;o much le&s;s can Chri&s;ti|ans
ju&s;tify the Endeavours to erect this or that
Opinion in it, by the Ruine and Blood of their
Brethren.</P>
<P>But this is far from being a Rea&s;on, why we
&s;hould not think it our Duty to &s;ubdue the barba|rous
and idolatrous Nations of the World; in Or|der
to &s;uppre&s;s the Wor&s;hipping the Devil, who
<PB N="254" REF="270">
is the Enemy not only of God, and of all true Re|ligion
in the World, but who is the great De&s;troy|er
and Enemy of Mankind, and of his future or
pre&s;ent Felicity; and who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s is always to
the utmo&s;t of his Power to involve and retain them
either in Ignorance, or in Error.</P>
<P>I di&s;tingui&s;h between forcing Religion upon
People, or forcing them to entertain this or that
Opinion of Religion; I &s;ay, I di&s;tingui&s;h between
that, and opening the Door for Religion to come
among them: The former is a Violence indeed,
incon&s;i&s;tent with the Nature of Religion it &s;elf,
who&s;e Energy prevails and forces its Way into the
Minds of Men, by another Sort of Power; Where|as
the latter is removing a Force unju&s;tly put al|ready
upon the Minds of Men by the Artifice of
the Devil, to keep the Chri&s;tian Religion out of
the World; &s;o that indeed I propo&s;e a War not
with Men, but with the Devil; a War to depo&s;e
<HI>Sathan</HI>'s infernal Tyranny in the World, and &s;et
open the Doors to Religion, that it may enter if
Men will receive it; if they will not receive it,
be that to them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>In a Word,</HI> to unchain the Wills of Men, &s;et
their Inclinations free, that their Rea&s;on may be
at Liberty to influence their Under&s;tandings, and
that they may have the Faith of Chri&s;t preach'd
to them; whether they will hear or forbear, I &s;ay,
as above, is no Part of the Que&s;tion, let the Chri|&s;tian
Doctrine and its &s;piritual Enemies alone to
&s;truggle about that: I am for dealing with the
Tempora$ities or the Devil, and depo&s;ing that hu|man
Power which is armed in the Behalf of ob&s;ti|nate
Ignorance, and re&s;olute to keep out the Light
of Religion from the Mind.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="271">
I think this is a lawful and ju&s;t War, and in the

the <HI>Britains,</HI> and was a Means of reducing a hea|then
and barbarous Nation to the Faith of Chri&s;t,
and to embrace the Me&s;&s;ias.</P>
<P>Thus Heaven &s;erves it &s;elf of Mens wor&s;t De|&s;igns,
and the Avarice, Ambition, and Rage of
Men, have been made U&s;e of to bring to pa&s;s the
glorious Ends of Providence, without the lea&s;t
Knowledge or De&s;ign of the Actors: Why then
may not the great Undertakings of the Princes of
<HI>Europe, if they could be brought to act in Concert,</HI> with
a good De&s;ign to bring all the World, to open their
Doors to the Chri&s;tian Religion, and by Con&s;e|quence
their Ears? I &s;ay, why may not &s;uch an
<PB N="256" REF="272">
Attempt be ble&s;&s;ed from Heaven with &s;o much
Succe&s;s, at lea&s;t as to make Way for bringing in
nominal Chri&s;tianity among the Nations? For as
to obliging the People to be of this or that Opini|on
afterward, that is another Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>There is a great Pother made in the World a|mong
the &s;everal Denominations of Chri&s;tians
about Coertion, erecting a Church, and compel|ling
Men to come in; that is to &s;ay, one Sort of
Chri&s;tians per&s;ecuting another Sort of Chri&s;tians,
to make them wor&s;hip Chri&s;t their Way, as if
Chri&s;t had no Sheep but one Fold.</P>
<P>I di&s;tingui&s;h much between u&s;ing Force to re|duce
Heathens and Savages to Chri&s;tianity, and
u&s;ing Force to reduce tho&s;e that are already Chri|&s;tians,
to be of this or that Opinion; I will not
&s;ay but a War might be very ju&s;t, and the Cau&s;e
be righteous, to reduce the Wor&s;hippers of the Pa|gods
of <HI>India,</HI> to the Knowledge and Obedience
of Chri&s;tianity, when it would be a horrible In|ju&s;tice
to commence a like War, to reduce even
a Popi&s;h Nation to be Prote&s;tant.</P>
<P>But my propos'd War does not reach &s;o far as
that neither; for tho' I would have a Nation of Pa|gans
conquer'd, that their Idols and Temples
might be de&s;troy'd, and their Idol Wor&s;hip be
aboli&s;h'd; yet I would be very far from puni&s;hing
and per&s;ecuting the People for not believing in
Chri&s;t: For if we believe that Faith, as the Scrip|ture
&s;ays is the Gift of God, How can we upon
any Chri&s;tian Foundation, puni&s;h or per&s;ecute the
Man for not exerci&s;ing that which God had not
given him.</P>
<P>Hence, compelling Men to conform to this
or that particular Profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion,
is to me impious and unchri&s;tian.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="273">
And &s;hall I &s;peak a Word here of the unhap|py
Cu&s;tom among Chri&s;tians, of reviling one
another with Words, on Account of differing O|pinions
in Religion: It was a Part of <HI>Apocryphal</HI>
Scripture, taken from one of the traditional Say|ings
of the Rabbies, <HI>Thou &s;halt not mock at the
Gods of the Heathens:</HI> But Ribaldry, Satyr, and
Sarca&s;ms, are the U&s;age we give one another
every Day on the Subject of Religion; as if Slan|der
and the Severities of the Tongue, were not the
wor&s;t kind of Violence in Matters of the Chri|&s;tian
Religion.</P>
<P>In a Word, I mu&s;t acknowledge, if I am to
&s;peak of Reproach in general, I know no wor&s;e
Per&s;ecution than that of the Tongue; <HI>Solomon</HI>
&s;ays, <HI>There are that &s;peak, like the piercing of a Sword;</HI>
and King <HI>David</HI> was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Bitterne&s;s
of the Tongue, that he is full of Exclamations
upon the Subject; among the re&s;t, he &s;ays of his
Enemies, <HI>They have compa&s;&s;ed me about with Words
of Hatred. He cloathed him&s;elf with Cur&s;ing like as
with his Garment,</HI> P&s;alm cix. 3, 18.</P>
<P>It is indeed remote from the Subject I am upon,
to talk of this kind of uncharitable Dealing, but
as ju&s;t Ob&s;ervations are never out of Sea&s;on, it
may have its U&s;es: Let no Man &s;light the Hint,
tho' it were meant of Religion only, for that indeed
is my pre&s;ent Subject; there is doubtle&s;s as &s;evere
a Per&s;ecution by the Tongue, as that of Fire and
Faggot, and &s;ome think 'tis as hard to be born.</P>
<P>I have never met with &s;o much of this any
where in all my Travels as in <HI>England,</HI> where the
Mouths of the &s;everal Sects and Opinions are &s;o
effectually open again&s;t one another, that albeit
common Charity commands us to talk the be&s;t of
particular Per&s;ons in their Failings and Infirmi|ties;
yet <HI>here,</HI> cen&s;uring, condemning and re|proaching
<PB N="258" REF="274">
one another on Account of Opinions,
is carried on with &s;uch a Gu&s;t, that lets every one
&s;ee nothing but Death and De&s;truction can follow,
and no Reconciliation can be expected.</P>
<P>I have liv'd to &s;ee Men of the be&s;t Light be
mi&s;taken, as well in Party as in Principles, as well
in Politicks as in Religion, and find not only Oc|ca&s;ion,
but even a Nece&s;&s;ity to change Hands or
Sides in both; I have &s;een them &s;ometimes run in|to
contrary Extremes, beyond their fir&s;t Inten|tion,
and even without De&s;ign: Nay, in tho&s;e un|happy
Changes, I have &s;een them driven into
Lengths they never de&s;igned, by the fiery Re|&s;entment
of tho&s;e whom they &s;eem'd to have
left, and whom they differ'd from; I have lived to
&s;ee tho&s;e Men acknowledge even publickly and
openly, they were wrong and mi&s;taken, and ex|pre&s;s
their Regret for being mi&s;led very &s;incerely;
but I cannot &s;ay, I have liv'd to &s;ee the People,
they have de&s;ir'd to return to, forgive or receive
them: Perhaps, the Age I have lived in, has not
been a proper Sea&s;on for Charity, I hope Futurity
will be furni&s;h'd with better Chri&s;tians, or per|haps
'tis appointed &s;o, to illu&s;trate the divine Mer|cy,
and let Mankind &s;ee, that they are the only
Creatures that never forgive. I have &s;een a Man
in the Ca&s;e I &s;peak of, offer the mo&s;t &s;incere Ac|knowledgments
of his having been mi&s;taken, and
this not in Matters e&s;&s;ential either to the Per&s;on's
Morals or Chri&s;tianity, but only in Matters of
Party, and with the mo&s;t moving Expre&s;&s;ions, de|&s;ire
his old Friends to forgive what has been
pa&s;s'd; and have &s;een their Return, be mocking
him with what they called a Ba&s;ene&s;s of Spirit,
and a mean Submi&s;&s;ion: I have &s;een him expo&s;tu|late
with them, why they &s;hould not act upon
the &s;ame Terms with a Penitent, as God him&s;elf
<PB N="259" REF="275">
not only pre&s;cribed, but yields to; and have &s;een
them in Return, tell him, God might forgive him
if he plea&s;ed, but they would never; and then ex|po&s;e
all tho&s;e Offers to the fir&s;t Comer in Banter
and Ridicule: But take me right too, I have &s;een
at the &s;ame Time, that to wi&s;er Men it has been
always thought to be an expo&s;ing them&s;elves, and
an Honour to the Per&s;on.</P>
<P>I &s;peak this <HI>too feelingly,</HI> and therefore &s;ay no
more; there is a Way by Patience, to conquer
even the univer&s;al Contempt of Mankind; and
though two Drams of that Drug be a Vomit
for a Dog, it is in my Experience the only Me|thod;
there is a &s;ecret Peace in it, and in Time
the Rage of Men will abate, a con&s;tant &s;teady
adhering to Vertue and Hone&s;ty, and &s;hewing the
World, that whatever Mi&s;takes he might be led
into, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be Mi&s;takes, that yet the
main Intention and De&s;ign of his Life, was &s;in|cere
and upright; he that governs the Actions of
Men by an unbia&s;s'd Hand, will never &s;uffer
&s;uch a Man to &s;ink under the Weight of univer&s;al
Prejudice and Clamour.</P>
<P>I ROBINSON CRUSOE, grown old in Affli|ction,
born down by Calumny and Reproach, but
&s;upported from within, boldly pre&s;cribe this Re|medy
again&s;t universal Clamours and Contempt of
Mankind; Patience, a &s;teady Life of Vertue and
Sobriety, and a comforting Dependance on the
Ju&s;tice of Providence, will fir&s;t or la&s;t re&s;tore the
Patient to the Opinion of his Friends, and ju&s;tify
him in the Face of his Enemies; and in the mean
time; will &s;upport him comfortably, in de&s;pi&s;ing
tho&s;e who want Manners and Charity, and leave
them to be cur&s;ed from Heaven with their own
Pa&s;&s;ions and Rage.</P>

This very Thought made me long ago claim
a kind of Property in &s;ome good old Lines of

had in the Time of the Civil Wars in <HI>England,</HI>
been unhappy in changing of Sides too often, and
and had been put into the <HI>Tower</HI> by every Side in
their Turn; once by the King, once by the Par|liament,

and at la&s;t again, <HI>I think,</HI> by General <HI>Monk;</HI> in

<L>The World and I may well agree,</L>

<L>For I &s;light her, and &s;he &s;lights me,</L>

<L>Good Con&s;cience is a daily Fea&s;t,</L>

</LG>
<P>But this Article of verbal Per&s;ecution, has
hurried me from my Subject, which I mu&s;t re|turn
to.</P>
<P>I have &s;poken of a Project for the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;|covy,</HI>
worthy of a Monarch, who is Lord of &s;o
va&s;t an extent of Country, as the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Empire
reaches to; which is in Effect as I have &s;aid,
much more than half <HI>Europe,</HI> and con&s;equently an
eighth Part of the World. I have given my
Thoughts how a War to open a Door for the
<PB N="261" REF="277">
Chri&s;tian Religion may be ju&s;tifiable, and that it has
not the lea&s;t Tincture of Per&s;ecution in it: If the
Chri&s;tian Princes of the World, who now &s;pend
their Force &s;o much to an ill Purpo&s;e, in real Per|&s;ecution,
would join in an univer&s;al War again&s;t
Pagani&s;m and Devil-wor&s;hip, the &s;avage Part
of Mankind would in one Age, be brought to
bow their Knees to the God of Truth, and would
ble&s;s the Enterpri&s;e it &s;elf in the End of it, as
the be&s;t Thing that ever befel them: Nor could
&s;uch an Attempt fail of Succe&s;s, unle&s;s Heaven in
Ju&s;tice had determined to &s;hut up the World lon|ger
in Darkne&s;s, and the Cup of their Abomina|tions
was not yet full: But I may venture to &s;ay,
there would be much more Ground for &s;uch
Chri&s;tian Princes to hope and expect the Con|currence
of Heaven in &s;uch an Undertaking, than
in &s;heathing their Swords in the Bowels of
their Brethren, and making an Effu&s;ion of Chri|&s;tian
Blood upon every &s;light Pretence, as we &s;ee
has been the Ca&s;e in <HI>Europe</HI> for above thirty Years
pa&s;t.</P>
<P>I had intended to remark here, that as the
Country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Chri&s;tians is but a Spot of the
Globe, compared to the Heathen, Pagan, and
Mahometan World; &s;o the Number of real Chri|&s;tians
among the Nations profe&s;&s;ing the Chri&s;tian
Name, is yet a more di&s;proportioned Part, a mere
Triflle, and hardly to be compar'd with the infi|nite
Numbers of tho&s;e who tho' they call them&s;elves
Chri&s;tians, yet know as little of God and Reli|gion
as can be imagin'd to be known, where the
Word Chri&s;tian is &s;poken of, and neither &s;eek or
de&s;ire to know more; in a Word, who know but
little of God or Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Heaven or Hell, and
regard none of them.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="278">
This is a large Field and being througly &s;earch'd
into, would I doubt not, reduce the real faithful
Subjects of the Kingdom of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to a
much fewer Number than tho&s;e of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> nay,
than tho&s;e of the Monarch of <HI>Germany;</HI> and make
our Lord appear a weaker Prince, &s;peaking in the
Sen&s;e of Kingdoms, than many of the King's of
the Earth. And if it be true that the old King
of <HI>France</HI> &s;hould &s;ay, That he had more loyal Sub|jects
than King Je&s;us; I do not know, but in the
Sen&s;e his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty meant it, the
Thing might be very true.</P>
<P>But this Ob&s;ervation is &s;omething out of my
pre&s;ent Road, and merits to be &s;poken of by it&s;elf.
The Number of true Chri&s;tians will never be
known on this Side the great Bar, where they
&s;hall be critically &s;eparated. No political Arith|metick
can make a Calculation of the Number
of true Chri&s;tians, while they live blended with
the fal&s;e ores, &s;ince it is not only hard, but im|po&s;&s;ible
to know them one from another in this
World.</P>
<P>We &s;hall perhaps be &s;urpri&s;ed at the la&s;t Day, to
&s;ee &s;ome People at the Right-hand of the righ|teous
Judge, whom we have condemned with
the utmo&s;t Zeal in our Opinions, while we were
Contemporary with them in Life; for Charity,
as it is generally practi&s;ed in this World, and
mix'd with our human Infirmities, &s;uch as Pride,
Self-opinion, and Per&s;onal-prejudice, is &s;trangely
mi&s;-guided, and makes us entertain Notions of
Things and of People, quite different from what
they really de&s;erve; and there is hardly any Rule
to pre&s;cribe our&s;elves, except it be of the Text,
<HI>In Meekne&s;s, every one e&s;teeming other better than
them&s;elves,</HI> which by the Way, is difficult to
do.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="279">
But though we &s;hall thus &s;ee at the great <HI>Au|dit,</HI>
a Tran&s;po&s;ition of Per&s;ons from the Station
they held in our Charity, we &s;hall only thereby
&s;ee that our Judgment was wrong; that God
judgeth not as Man judgeth, and that we too
ra&s;hly condemn, whom he has thought fit to ju|&s;tify
and accept.</P>
<P>Let then the Number of Chri&s;tians be more or
le&s;s, as he that makes them Chri&s;tians determines,
this is not for us to enter into, and this brings
me back to what I &s;aid before, that though we
cannot make Chri&s;tians, we both can and may, and
indeed ought to open the Door to Chri&s;tianity,
that the Preaching of God's Word, which is the
ordinary Means of bringing Mankind to the Know|ledge
of Religion, may be &s;pread over the whole
World.</P>
<P>With what Vigour do we con&s;ult, and how do
the labouring Heads of the World club together
to form Projects, and to rai&s;e Sub&s;criptions to
extend the general Commerce of Nations in|to
every Corner of the World: But 'twould
pa&s;s for a Bubble of all Bubbles, and a Whim&s;y
that none would engage in, if ten Millions &s;hould
be asked to be &s;ub&s;cribed, for &s;ending a &s;trong
Fleet and Army to conquer Heatheni&s;m and Ido|latry,
and protect a Mi&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tians, to be
employ'd in Preaching the Go&s;pel to the poor
Heathens, &s;ay it were on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cormandel,</HI>
the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylon</HI> and Country of <HI>Malabar,</HI> or
any of the Dominions of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and
yet &s;uch an Attempt would not only be ju&s;t, but
infinitely advantageous to the People who &s;hould
undertake it, and to the People of the Country,
on whom the Operation &s;hould be wrought.</P>
<P>In the occa&s;ional Di&s;cour&s;es I had on this Subject,
in Conver&s;ation with Men of good Judg|ment
<PB N="264" REF="280">
and Principles, I have been often ask'd
in what Manner I would propo&s;e to carry on &s;uch
a Conque&s;t as I &s;peak of, and how it &s;hould an|&s;wer
the End; and that I may not be &s;uppo&s;ed to
&s;ugge&s;t a Thing impracticable in it&s;elf or for
which no rational Scheme might be propo&s;ed, I
&s;hall make a brief E&s;&s;ay, at the Manner, in which
the Conque&s;t I &s;peak of &s;hould be, or ought to be
carried on; and if it be con&s;idered &s;eriou&s;ly, the
Difficulties and perhaps all the rea&s;onable Ob|jections
might vani&s;h in an In&s;tant. I will there|fore
fir&s;t, <HI>for the Purpo&s;e only,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e that an At|tempt
was made by a Chri&s;tian Nation, to con|quer
and &s;ubdue &s;ome Heathen or <HI>Mahometan</HI> Peo|ple
at a Di&s;tance from them, place the Conque&s;t
where, and among whom we will: For Example,
Suppo&s;e it was the great I&s;land of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> or
that of <HI>Ceylon, Borneo</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI> or tho&s;e of
<HI>Japan,</HI> or any other where you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I would fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, the Place to be infinite|ly
populous as any of tho&s;e Countries, though
they are I&s;lands, are &s;aid to be; and becau&s;e the
<HI>Japonne&s;e</HI> are &s;aid to be a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible &s;agacious
People, under excellent Forms of Government,
and capable more than ordinarily of receiving
Impre&s;&s;ions, &s;upported by the Argument and Ex|ample
of a vertuous and religious Conqueror.</P>
<P>For this Purpo&s;e you mu&s;t grant me, that the
I&s;land or I&s;lands of <HI>Japan</HI> were in a Situation
proper for the undertaking, and that a powerful
<HI>European</HI> Army being landed upon them, had in a
great Battle or in divers Battles, over-thrown
all their Military Force, and had entirely re|duced
the whole Nation to their Power: As to
go back to Examples, the <HI>Venetians</HI> had done by
the <HI>Turks</HI> in the <HI>Morea</HI> in a former War, or as
The <HI>Turks</HI> did in the I&s;les of <HI>Candia, Cyprus,</HI> and
<PB N="265" REF="281">
the like. The &s;hort Scheme for e&s;tabli&s;hing the
Government in tho&s;e Countries &s;hould be this;
<LIST>
<ITEM>Fir&s;t, As the War is pointed chiefly a|gain&s;t
the Kingdom of the Devil, in
behalf of the Chri&s;tian Wor&s;hip, &s;o
no Quarter &s;hould be given to Satan's
Admini&s;tration; and as nothing el&s;e
&s;hould willingly be treated with Vio|lence;
&s;o indeed no Part of the De|vils
O Economy &s;hould have any Fa|vour,
but all the Idols &s;hould imme|diately
be de&s;troyed, and publickly
burnt, all the Pagods and Temples
burnt, and the very Face and Form
of Pagani&s;m and the Wor&s;hip attend|ing
it, be utterly defaced and de|&s;troyed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, The Prie&s;ts and dedicated Per|&s;ons
of every kind, by what&s;oever
Names or Titles known or di&s;tin|gui&s;hed,
&s;hould be at le$&s;t removed,
if not de&s;troyed.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly, All the Exerci&s;e of profane and
idolatrous Rites, Ceremonies, Wor|&s;hip,
Fe&s;tivals, and Cu&s;toms, &s;hould
be aboli&s;hed entirely, &s;o as by Time
to be forgotten, and clean wiped out
of the Minds, as well as out of the
Practice of the People.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This is all the Coertion I propo&s;e, and le&s;s than
this cannot be propo&s;ed, becau&s;e though we may
not by Arms and Force compel$ Men to be reli|gious,
becau&s;e if we do, we cannot make them
<PB N="266" REF="282">
&s;incere, and &s;o by Per&s;ecution we only create Hy|pocrites;

Pagani&s;m, and the Wor&s;hip of God's Enemy
the Devil, and bani&s;h it out of the World; nay,
that we ought to do it to the utmo&s;t of our Power:
But I return to the Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>The Country being thus entirely reduced under
Chri&s;tian Government, the Inhabitants if they
&s;ubmit quietly, ought to be u&s;ed with Humanity
and Ju&s;tice; no Cruelty, no Rigour; they &s;hould
&s;uffer no Oppre&s;&s;ion, Injury, or Inju&s;tice, that
they may not receive evil Impre&s;&s;ions of the Peo|ple
that are come among them; le&s;t entertaining an
Abhorrence of Chri&s;tians, from their evil Conduct,
Cruelty, and Inju&s;tice, they &s;hould entertain an Ab|horrence
of the Chri&s;tian Religion for their Sakes;
as the poor Wretches the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> who
when they were talked to of the Future State,
the Re&s;urrection of the Dead, Eternal Felicity in
Heaven, and the like, enquir'd where the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
went after Death, and if any of them went to
Heaven? and being an&s;wered in the Affirmative,
&s;hook their Heads, and de&s;ired they might go to
Hell then, for that they were afraid to think of
being in Heaven, if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were there.</P>
<P>A ju&s;t and generous Behaviour to the Natives,
or at lea&s;t to &s;uch of them as &s;hould &s;how them|&s;elves
willing to &s;ubmit, would certainly engage
them in their Intere&s;t, and accordingly would in
a little while bring them to embrace that Truth,
which dictated &s;uch ju&s;t Principles to tho&s;e who
e&s;pou&s;ed it.</P>
<P>Thus Prejudices being removed, the Way to In|&s;truction
would be made the more plain, and then
would be the Time for Go&s;pel-Labourers to enter
upon the Harve&s;t; Mini&s;ters &s;hould be in&s;tructed
<PB N="267" REF="283">
to teach them our Language, to exhort them to
&s;eek the Ble&s;&s;ings of Religion and of the true
God, and &s;o gradually to introduce right Prin|ples
among them at their own Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>From hence they &s;hould proceed, to teach all
the young Children the Language &s;poken by them,
who would then be their Benefactors, rather than
Conquerors, and a few Years wearing the old Ge|neration
out, the Po&s;terity of them, and of their
Conquerors, would be all one Nation.</P>
<P>In Ca&s;e any rejected the In&s;truction of religious
Men, and adher'd ob&s;tinately to his Idolatry, and
would not be reclaimed by gentle and chri&s;tian U|&s;age,
&s;uitable Methods are to be taken with &s;uch,
that they might not make a religious Faction in the
Country, and gain others to &s;ide with them, in
older to recover their Liberty, as they might call it
to &s;erve their own Gods, that is to &s;ay Idols; for
it mu&s;t be for ever as ju&s;t, not to permit them to go
back to Idolatry by Force, as it was to pull
them from it by Force.</P>
<P>By this kind of Conque&s;t, the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion
would be mo&s;t effectually propagated among
innumerable Nations of Savages and Idola|ters,
and as many People be brought to wor&s;hip
the true God, as may be &s;aid to do it at this Time
in the whole Chri&s;tian World.</P>
<P>This is my <HI>Crui&s;ado,</HI> and it would be a War as
ju&s;tifiable on many Accounts, as any that was ever
undertaken in the World, a War that would bring
Eternal Honour to the Conquerors, and an Eternal
Ble&s;&s;ing to the People conquer'd.</P>
<P>It were ea&s;y now to cut out Enterpri&s;es of this
Nature for other of the Princes of the World than
the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> and I could lay very ratio|nal
Schemes for &s;uch Undertakings, and the
Schemes that could, if througly pur&s;ued never
<PB N="268" REF="284">
fail of Succe&s;s: For Example, An Expedition
again&s;t the <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Africa,</HI> by the <HI>French, Spani&s;h</HI>
and <HI>Italian</HI> Princes, who daily &s;uffer &s;o much by
them, and the la&s;t of whom are at perpetual War
with them; how ea&s;y would it be to tho&s;e
Powers to join in a Chri&s;tian Confederacy, to
plant the Chri&s;tian Religion again in the <HI>Numi|dian</HI>
and <HI>Mauritanian</HI> Kingdoms; where was once
the famous Church of <HI>Carthage,</HI> and from whence
Thou&s;ands of Chri&s;tians have gone to Heaven;
the Harve&s;t of the primitive Labours of St. <HI>Cy|prian,
Tertullian,</HI> and many more, who&s;e Po&s;te|rity
now bow their Knees to that late&s;t and wor&s;t
of all Impo&s;tors, <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>But unchri&s;tian Strife was always a Bar again&s;t
the Propagation of Chri&s;tian Religion, and unna|tural
Wars carried on among the Nations I &s;peak
of, are made &s;o much the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Chri&s;tian
World, that I do not expect in our Time, to &s;ee
the Advantages taken hold of, that the Nature of
the Thing offers: But I am per&s;uaded, and leave it
upon Record as my &s;ettled Opinion, that one
Time or other, the Chri&s;tian Powers of <HI>Europe,</HI>
&s;hall be in&s;pired from Heaven for &s;uch a Work,
and then the Ea&s;ine&s;s of &s;ubduing the Kingdom of
<HI>Africa</HI> to the Chri&s;tian Power, &s;hall &s;hame the Ge|nerations
pa&s;t, who had the Opportunity &s;o often
in their Hands, but made no U&s;e of it.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> In this Part of the Subject I am upon, I
mu&s;t acknowledge there is a double Argument
for a War: 1. In Point of the interfering Intere&s;ts,
<HI>Europe</HI> ought to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Shoars,
without which it is manife&s;t her Commerce is not
&s;ecured; and indeed, while that Part of <HI>Africk</HI>
bordering on the Sea, is in the Hands of Robbers,
Pyrates cannot be &s;ecur'd: Now, this is a Point
of undi&s;puted Right, for a War-Trade claims the
<PB N="269" REF="285">
Protection of the Powers to whom it belongs, and
we make no Scruple to make War upon one ano|ther,
for the Protection of our Trade, and it is
allowed to be a good Rea&s;on why we &s;hould do
&s;o. Why then is it not a good Rea&s;on to make
War upon Thieves and Robbers? If one Nation
takes the Ships belonging to another, we imme|diately
reclaim the Prize from the Captors, and
require of the Prince, that Ju&s;tice be done again&s;t
the Aggre&s;&s;or, who is a Breaker of the Peace;
and it this is refu&s;ed, we make War.</P>
<P>But &s;hall we do thus to Chri&s;tians, and &s;cruple
to make an univer&s;al War for the rooting out a
Race of Pyrates and Rovers who live by Rapin,
and are continually employed like the Lions and
Tygers of their own <HI>Lybia</HI> in devouring their
Neighbours: This, I &s;ay, makes &s;uch a War not
only ju&s;t on a religious Account, but both ju&s;t
and nece&s;&s;ary upon a civil Account.</P>
<P>The War then being thus proved to be ju&s;t on
other Accounts, why &s;hould not 2. The Extir|pation
of Idolatry, Pagani&s;m, and Devil-Wor&s;hip,
be the Con&s;equence of the Victory. If God be
allow'd to be the Giver of Victory, how can it
be an&s;wered to him, that the Victory &s;hould not
be made U&s;e of, for the Intere&s;t and Glory of
the God of War, from whom it proceeds? But
the&s;e Things are not to be offered to the World,
till higher Principles work in the Minds of Men,
in their making War and Peace, than yet &s;eems to
take up their Minds.</P>
<P>I was tempted upon this Occa&s;ion, to make an
Excur&s;ion here, upon the Subject of the very
light Occa&s;ions, Princes and Powers, States and
State&s;men make u&s;e of, for the engaging in War
and Blood one again&s;t another; one for being ill
&s;atisfied with the other, and another for pre&s;erving
<PB N="270" REF="286">
the Ballance of Power; this for nothing at all,
and that for &s;omething next to nothing; and how
little Concern the Blood that is nece&s;&s;arily &s;pilt
in the&s;e Wars produces among them: But this is
not a Ca&s;e that will &s;o well bear, to be entred
upon in a publick Manner at this Time.</P>
<P>All I can add is, I doubt, no &s;uch Zeal for the
Chri&s;tian Religion, will be found in our Days, or
perhaps in any Age of the World, till Heaven beats
the Drums it&s;elf, and the glorious Legions from above
come down on Purpo&s;e to propagate the Work, and
to reduce the whole World to the Obedience of
King <HI>Je&s;us;</HI> a Time which &s;ome tell us is not far
off: But of which I heard nothing in all my Travels
and Illuminations, <HI>no not one Word.</HI></P>

<P>_THEY mu&s;t be much taken up

<P>The Place, the Company, the

<P>I believe the main Interruptions which have

<PB N="2" REF="288">

entred into them, have &s;atisfied them&s;elves in the
utter Neglect, have been the wild chimerick
Notions, enthu&s;ia&s;tick Dreams, and un&s;atisfying
Ideas, which mo&s;t of the Conceptions of Men
have led them into, about the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>As I endeavour to conceive ju&s;tly of the&s;e
Things, I &s;hall likewi&s;e endeavour to rea&s;on upon
them clearly, and, if po&s;&s;ible, convey &s;ome &s;uch
Ideas of the invi&s;ible World to the Thoughts of
Men, as may not be confu&s;ed and indige&s;ted, and
&s;o leave them darker than I find them.</P>
<P>The Locality of Heaven or Hell is no Part of
my Search; there is doubtle&s;s a Place re&s;erv'd
for the Reception of our Souls after Death; as
there is a State of Being for material Sub&s;tances,
&s;o there mu&s;t be a Place; if we are to BE, we
mu&s;t have <HI>a where;</HI> the Scripture &s;upports Rea|&s;on
in it, <HI>Judas</HI> is gone to his Place, <HI>Dives</HI> in
Hell lift up his Eyes, and &s;aw <HI>Lazarus</HI> in <HI>Abra|ham</HI>'s
Bo&s;om; the Locality of Bli&s;s and Mi&s;ery
&s;eems to be po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted in both Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>But there is not &s;o clear a View of the Company
as of the Place; it is not &s;o ea&s;y to enquire into
the World of Spirits, as it is evident that there
are &s;uch Spirits, and &s;uch a World; we find the
Locality of it is natural, but who the Inhabitants
are, is a Search of &s;till a &s;ublimer Nature, liable
to more Exception, encumber'd with more Dif|ficulties,
and expo&s;ed to much more Uncertainty.</P>
<P>I &s;hall endeavour to clear up as much of it as
I can, and intimate mo&s;t willingly, how much I
rejoyce in the Expectation, that &s;ome other En|quirers
may go farther, 'till at la&s;t, all that Pro|vidence
has thought fit to di&s;cover of that Part
may be perfectly known.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="289">
The Di&s;coveries in the Scripture which lead
to this, are innumerable; but the po&s;itive Decla|ration
of it &s;eems to be declin'd. When our Sa|viour
walking on the Sea frighted his Di&s;ciples,
and they cried out, what do we find terrify'd
them? Truly, they thought they had &s;een a Spi|rit.
One would have thought &s;uch Men as they,
who had the Vi&s;ion of <HI>God manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h,</HI>
&s;hould not have been &s;o much &s;urpriz'd, if they
had &s;een a Spirit, that is to &s;ay, <HI>&s;een an Apparition;</HI>
for to &s;ee a Spirit, &s;eems to be an Allu&s;ion, not
an Expre&s;&s;ion to be us'd literally, a Spirit being
not vi&s;ible by the Organ of human Sight.</P>
<P>But what if it had been a Spirit? if it had
been a good Spirit, what had they to fear? And
if a bad Spirit, what would <HI>crying out</HI> have a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
them? When People cry out in &s;uch Ca&s;es,
it is either for Help, and then they cry to others;
or for Mercy, and then they cry to the Subject
of their Terror to &s;pare them. Either Way it
was either the fooli&s;he&s;t, or the wickede&s;t Thing
that ever was done by &s;uch grave Men as the
Apo&s;tles; for if it was a good Spirit, as before;
they had no Need to cry out; and if it was a bad
one, who did they cry to? For 'tis evident they
did not pray to God, or cro&s;s and ble&s;s them|&s;elves,
as was afterwards the Fa&s;hion; but they
<HI>cried out,</HI> that is to &s;ay, they either cried out for
Help, which was great Non&s;en&s;e, to call to Man
for Help again&s;t the Devil; or they cried to the
Spirit they &s;aw, that it might not hurt them,
which was, in &s;hort, neither le&s;s, or more, than
praying to the Devil.</P>
<P>This put me in Mind of the poor Savages in
many of the Countries of <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> who
really in&s;tructed by their Fear, that is to &s;ay, by
meer Nature, wor&s;hip the Devil, that he may not
hurt them.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="290">
Here I mu&s;t digre&s;s a little, and make a Tran|&s;ition
from the Story of a Spirit, to the &s;trange
Ab&s;urdities of Mens Notions at that Time; and
particularly, of tho&s;e upon whom the fir&s;t Im|pre&s;&s;ions
of Chri&s;t's Preachings were wrought,
and if it be look'd narrowly into, one cannot but
wonder what &s;trange ignorant People, even the
Di&s;ciples them&s;elves were, at fir&s;t; and indeed
their Ignorance continued a great while, even
to after the Death of Chri&s;t him&s;elf; witne&s;s the
fooli&s;h Talk of the two Di&s;ciples going to <HI>Emans.</HI>
It is true they were wi&s;er afterwards when they
were better taught; but the Scripture is full of
the Di&s;coveries of their Ignorance; as in the No|tions
of &s;itting at his Right-hand and his Left, in
his Kingdom, ask'd for by <HI>Zebedee</HI>'s Children; no
doubt but the good Woman their Mother thought
one of her Sons &s;hould be Lord Trea&s;urer there,
and the t'other Lord Chancellor, and &s;he could
not but think tho&s;e Places their Due, when &s;he
&s;aw them in &s;uch Favour with him here. Ju&s;t &s;o
in their Notion of &s;eeing a Spirit here, which
put them into &s;uch a Fright, and indeed they
might be &s;aid, according to our dull Way of
Talking, to be frighted out of their Wits; For
had their Sen&s;es been in Exerci&s;e, they would ei|ther
have rejoic'd in the Appearance of a good
Angel, and &s;tood &s;till to hear his Me&s;&s;age, as
from Heaven; or pray'd to God to deliver them
out of the Hands of the Devil, on their &s;uppo&s;ing
it, as above, to be a Vi&s;ion from Hell.</P>
<P>But I come to the Subject. It is evident that
the Notion of Spirits, and their intermeddling
with the Affairs of Men, and even of their ap|pearing
to Men, prevail'd fo univer&s;ally in tho&s;e
Ages of the World, that even God's own People,
who were in&s;tructed from him&s;elf, believ'd it,
<PB N="5" REF="291">
nor is there any Thing in all the Old Te&s;tament
In&s;titution to contradict it, tho' many Things
to confirm it; &s;uch particularly, as the Law
again&s;t what is call'd a familiar Spirit, which
was e&s;teem'd no better or wor&s;e than a conver|&s;ing
with the Devil, that is to &s;ay, with &s;ome
of the evil Spirits of the World I &s;peak of.</P>
<P>The Witch of <HI>Endor,</HI> and the Story of an Ap|parition
of an old Man per&s;onating <HI>Samuel,</HI> which
is &s;o plainly a&s;&s;erted in Scripture, and which the
learned Oppo&s;ers of the&s;e Notions have &s;pent &s;o
much weak Pains to di&s;turb our Imaginations
about, yet a&s;&s;ure us, that &s;uch Apparitions are
not incon&s;i&s;tent with Nature, or with Religion;
nay, the Scripture allows this Woman to <HI>Paw waw,</HI>
as the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>America</HI> call it, and conjure for
the rai&s;ing this Spectre, and when it is come, al|lows
it to &s;peak a great prophetick Truth, fore|telling
the King in all its terrible Particulars what
was to happen to him, and what did befal him
the very next Day.</P>
<P>Either this Appearance mu&s;t be a good Spirit,
or a bad; if it was a good Spirit, it was an
Angel, as it is expre&s;s'd in another Place of the
Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> when he knock'd at the good
People's Door in <HI>Jeru&s;alem, Acts</HI> xii. 15. and then it
&s;upports my Opinion of the Spirits unembodied
conver&s;ing with, and taking Care of the Spirits
embodied; if it was an evil Spirit, then they
mu&s;t grant God to be making a Prophet of the
Devil, and making him per&s;onate <HI>Samuel</HI> to foretel
Things to come; permitting Sathan to &s;peak in the
fir&s;t Per&s;on of God's own Prophet, and indeed to
preach the Ju&s;tice of God's Dealing with <HI>Saul,</HI> for
rejecting his Prophet <HI>Samuel;</HI> which in &s;hort, is not
a little odd, putting the Spirit of God into the
<PB N="6" REF="292">
Mouth of the Devil, and making Sathan a
Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>When I was in my Retirement, I had a|bundance
of &s;trange Notions of my &s;eeing Ap|paritions
there, and e&s;pecially when I hap|pen'd
to be abroad by Moon-&s;hine, when every
Bu&s;h look'd like a Man, and every Tree like a
Man on Hor&s;e-back; and I &s;o prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd my
&s;elf with it, that I &s;carce dur&s;t look behind me
for a good while, and after that dur&s;t not go a|broad
at all at Night; nay, it grew upon me to
&s;uch a Degree at la&s;t, that I as firmly believ'd I
&s;aw &s;everal Times real Shapes and Appearances,
as I do now really believe and am a&s;&s;ur'd, that it
was all Hypochondriack Delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But however, that the Reader may &s;ee how
far the Power of Imagination may go, and judge
for me whether I &s;hew'd any more Folly and Sim|plicity
than other Men might do, I'll repeat &s;ome
little Pa&s;&s;ages, which for a while gave me very
great Di&s;turbances, and every one &s;hall judge for
me, whether they might not have been deluded in
the like Circum&s;tances as well as I.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Ca&s;e was, when I crept into the dark
Cave in the Valley, where the old Goat lay ju&s;t
expiring, which, wherever it happen'd, is a true
Hi&s;tory, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t I was &s;topp'd by the Noi&s;e of this
poor dying Creature, you are to ob&s;erve, that
the Voice was not only like the Voice of a Man,
but even articulate, only that I could not form
any Words from it; and what did that amount to
more or le&s;s than this, namely, that it &s;poke,
but only it was in a Language that I did not un|der&s;tand.
If it was po&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the Sur|pri&s;e
of my Spirits on that Occa&s;ion, I would do
it here; how all my Blood run, <HI>or rather &s;tood &s;till,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="293">
chill'd in my Veins; how a cold Dew of Sweat
&s;at on my Forehead; how my Joints, like <HI>Bel&s;haz|zar</HI>'s
Knees, &s;hook one again&s;t another; and how,
as I &s;aid, my Hair would have lifted off my Hat,
if I had had one on my Head.</P>
<P>But this is not all. After the fir&s;t Noi&s;e of the
Creature which was a faint dying Kind of imper|fect
Bleating, not unu&s;ual, as I found afterward; I
&s;ay, after this, he fetch'd two or three deep Sighs
as lively, and as like human, as it is po&s;&s;ible to
imagine, as I have al&s;o &s;aid.</P>
<P>The&s;e were &s;o many Confirmations of my Sur|prize,
be&s;ides the Sight of his two glaring Eyes,
and carried it up to the Extreme of Fright and
Amazement; how I afterwards conquered this
childi&s;h Beginning, and mu&s;ter'd up Courage e|nough
to go into the Place with a Fire brand for
Light; and how I was pre&s;ently &s;atisfy'd with
&s;eeing the Creature who&s;e Condition made all the
little accidental Noi&s;es appear rational, I have
already &s;aid.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t acknowledge, that this real Surprize
left &s;ome Relicks or Remains behind it, that did
not wear quite off a great while, tho' I&s;truggl'd hard
with them: The Vapours that were rais'd at fir&s;t
were never &s;o laid, but that on every trifling Oc|ca&s;ion
they return'd; and I &s;aw, nay, I felt Ap|paritions,
as plainly and di&s;tinctly as ever I felt
or &s;aw any real Sub&s;tance in my Life.</P>
<P>The like was the Ca&s;e with me before that,
when I fir&s;t found the Print of a Man's Foot up|on
the Sand, by the Sea&s;ide on the North Part of
the I&s;land.</P>
<P>And the&s;e, I &s;ay, having left my Fancy a little
peevi&s;h and wayward, I had frequently &s;ome Re|turns
of the&s;e Vapours on differing Occa&s;ions,
and &s;ometimes even without Occa&s;ion; nothing
<PB N="8" REF="294">
but meer Hypochondriack Whim&s;ies, fluttering of
the Blood, and ri&s;ing of Vapours, which nobody
could give any Account of but my&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>For Example:</HI> It was one Night, after my having
&s;een &s;ome odd Appearances in the Air, of no great
Significance, that coming home and being in Bed,
but not a&s;leep, I felt a Pain in one of my Feet; af|ter
which it came to a kind of Numb'dne&s;s in my
Foot, which a little &s;urpriz'd me, and after that, a
kind of Tingling in my Blood, as if it had been
&s;ome Di&s;temper running up my Leg.</P>
<P>On a &s;udden I felt, as it were, &s;omething alive
lye upon me, as if it had been a Dog lying up|on
my Bed, from my Knee downwards about half
Way my Leg, and immediately afterwards I felt
it heavier, and felt it as plainly roll it&s;elf upon me
upwards upon my Thigh, for I lay on one Side;
I &s;ay, as if it had been a Creature lying upon me
with all his Weight, and turning his Body upon
me.</P>
<P>It was &s;o lively and &s;en&s;ible to me, and I re|member
it &s;o perfectly well, though it is now
many Years ago, that my Blood chills and flutters
about my Heart at the very writing it. I imme|diately
flung my &s;elf out of my Bed, and flew to
my Mu&s;quet, which &s;tood always ready at my
Hand, and, naked as I was, laid about me upon
the Bed in the dark, and every where el&s;e that I
could think of where any Body might &s;tand or lye,
but could find nothing. <HI>Lord deliver me from an
evil Spirit,</HI> &s;aid I! <HI>What can this be?</HI> And being
tired with groping about, and having broke two
or three of my Earthen Pots with making Blows
here and there to no Purpo&s;e, I went to light my
Candle, for my Lamp which I us'd to burn in the
Night, either had not been lighted, or was gone
out.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="295">
When I lighted a Candle, I could ea&s;ily &s;ee
there was no living Creature in the Place with
me, but the poor Parrot, who was wak'd and
frighted, and cry'd out, <HI>Hold your Tongue,</HI> and,
<HI>What's the Matter with you?</HI> Which Words he
learn'd of me, from my frequent &s;aying &s;o to him,
when he u&s;ed to make his ordinary wild Noi&s;e and
Screaming that I did not like.</P>
<P>The more I was &s;atisfy'd that there was nothing
in the Room, at lea&s;t to be &s;een, the more another
Concern came upon me. Lord! <HI>&s;ays I aloud,</HI> this
is the Devil. <HI>Hold your Tongue,</HI> &s;ays Poll. I was
&s;o mad at the Bird, tho' the Creature knew no|thing
of the Matter, that if he had hung near
me, I believe I &s;hould have killed him. I put my
Clothes on, and &s;at me down, for I could not find
in my Heart to go to Bed again; and as I &s;at
down, <HI>I am terribly frighted,</HI> &s;aid I. <HI>What's the
Matter with you?</HI> &s;ays Poll. You Toad, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> I'd
knock your Brains out if you were here. <HI>Hold your
Tongue,</HI> &s;ays he again, and then fell to chattering,
<HI>Robin Cru&s;oe,</HI> and, <HI>Poor Robin Cru&s;oe,</HI> as he us'd
to do.</P>
<P>Had I been in any Reach of a good Temper, it
had been enough to have compo&s;ed me; but I
was quite gone, I was fully po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a Belief,
that it was the Devil, and I pray'd mo&s;t heartily
to God, to be delivered from the Power of the
evil Spirit.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Time, I compo&s;ed my &s;elf a little,
and went to Bed again, and lying ju&s;t in the Po|&s;ture
as I was in before, I felt a little of the Ting|ling
in my Blood which I felt before, and I re|&s;olv'd
to lye &s;till, let it be what it would; it
came up as high as my Knee, as before, but no
higher; and now I began to &s;ee plainly that it was
all a Di&s;temper, that it was &s;omething Paralitick,
<PB N="10" REF="296">
and that affected the Nerves; but I had not ei|ther
Experience of &s;uch a thing, or Knowledge
of Di&s;ea&s;es, enough to be fully &s;atisfy'd of the Na|ture
of them, and whether any thing natural, any
Numbedne&s;s or Dead Pal&s;ie affecting one Part of
The Thigh, could feel as that did; till &s;ome Months
after that, I felt &s;omething of the very &s;ame again
at my fir&s;t lying down in my Bed for three or four
Nights together, which at fir&s;t gave me a little Con|cern
as a Di&s;temper, but at la&s;t gave me &s;uch Sa|tisfaction,
that the fir&s;t was nothing but the &s;ame
thing in a higher Degree; that the Plea&s;ure of
knowing it was only a Di&s;ea&s;e, was far beyond the
Concern at the Danger of it; Tho' a dead Pal&s;ie
to one in my Condition might rea&s;onably have been
one of the mo&s;t frightful Things in Nature; &s;ince
having no body to help me, I mu&s;t have inevitably
peri&s;h'd for meer Want of Food, not being able to
go from Place to Place to fetch it.</P>
<P>But to go back to the Ca&s;e in Hand, and to
the Apprehen&s;ion I had been in; all the &s;everal
Months that pa&s;s'd between the fir&s;t of this and
the la&s;t, I went about with a melancholy heavy
Heart, fully &s;atisfy'd that the Devil had been in
my Room, and lay upon my Bed.</P>
<P>Sometimes I would trye to argue my &s;elf a little
out of it, asking my &s;elf, Whether it was rea&s;on|able
to imagine the Devil had nothing el&s;e to do
than to come thither, and only lye down upon
me, and go away about his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ay not
one Word to me? What End it could an&s;wer? and
whether I thought the Devil was really bu&s;y'd
about &s;uch Trifles? Or whether he had not Em|ployment
enough of a higher Nature, &s;o that &s;uch
a Thing as that could be worth his while?</P>
<P>But &s;till then I was an&s;wer'd with my own
Thoughts, returning thus, What could it be? Or,
<PB N="11" REF="297">
if it was not a Devil, what was it? This I could
not an&s;wer by any Means at all; and &s;o I &s;till &s;unk
under the Belief, that it was the Devil, and no|thing
but the Devil.</P>
<P>You may be &s;ure, while I had this Fancy in my
Head, I was of Cour&s;e over-run with the Vapours,
and had all the Hypochondriack Fancies that ever
any melancholy Head could entertain; and what
with ruminating on the Print of a Foot upon the
Sand, and the Weight of the Devil upon me in my
Bed, I made no Difficulty to conclude, that the Old
Gentleman really vi&s;ited the Place; and in a Word,
it had been ea&s;y to have po&s;&s;e&s;s'd me, if I had con|tinued
&s;o much longer, that it was an enchanted
I&s;land, that there were a Million of evil Spirits in
it, and that the Devil was Lord of the Manor.</P>
<P>I &s;carce heard the lea&s;t Noi&s;e, near or far off,
but I &s;tarted, and expected to &s;ee a Devil; every
di&s;tant Bu&s;h upon a Hill, if I did not particularly
remember it before, was a Man, and every Stump
an Apparition; and I &s;carce went twenty Yards
together by Night or by Day, without looking
behind me.</P>
<P>Sometimes indeed I took a little Heart, and
would &s;ay <HI>well,</HI> let it be <HI>the Devil</HI> if it will, <HI>God</HI>
is Ma&s;ter of <HI>the Devil,</HI> and he can do me no Hurt,
unle&s;s he is permitted; he can be no where, but
he that made him is there too; and as I &s;aid after|wards,
when I was frighted with the old Goat
in a Cave, he is not fit to live all alone in &s;uch an
I&s;land for 20 Years that would be afraid to &s;ee the
Devil.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e Things la&s;ted but a &s;hort while,
and the Vapours that were rai&s;ed at fir&s;t, were not
to be laid &s;o ea&s;ily; for, in a Word, it was not
meer Imagination, but it was the Imagination
ras'd up to Di&s;ea&s;e: Nor did it ever quite wear
<PB N="12" REF="298">
off till I got my Man <HI>Fryday</HI> with me, of whom
I have &s;aid &s;o much; and then having Company
to talk to, the Hypo wore off, and I did not &s;ee
any more Devils after that.</P>
<P>Before I leave this Part, I cannot but give a Cau|tion
to all vapouri&s;h melancholy People, who&s;e I|maginations
run this Way; I mean, about &s;eeing
she Devil, Apparitions, and the like; namely, that
they &s;hould never look behind them, and over their
Shoulders as they go up Stairs, or look into the
Corners and Holes of Rooms with a Candle in
their Hands, or turn about to &s;ee who may be be|hind
them in any Walks or dark Fields, Lanes, or
the like; for let &s;uch know, they will &s;ee the Devil
whether he be there or no; nay, they will be &s;o
per&s;waded, that they do &s;ee him, that their very
Imagination will be a Devil to them where-ever
they go.</P>
<P>But after all this is &s;aid, let nobody &s;ugge&s;t,
that becau&s;e the brain-&s;ick Fancy, the vapouri&s;h
Hypochondriack Imagination repre&s;ents Spectres
and Spirits to us, and makes Apparitions for us,
that therefore there are no &s;uch Things as Spirits
both good and evil, any more than we &s;hould con|ceive
that there is no Devil, becau&s;e we do not
&s;ee him.</P>
<P>The Devil has Witne&s;&s;es of his Being and Na|ture,
ju&s;t as God him&s;elf has of his; they are not
indeed &s;o vi&s;ible or &s;o numerous, but we are all
able to bring Evidence of the Exi&s;tence of the
Devil from our own Frailties, as we are to bring
Evidence of the Exi&s;tence of God from the Facul|ties
of our Souls, and from the Contexture of our
Bodies.</P>
<P>As our Propen&s;ity to Evil rather than Good, is
a Te&s;timony of the original Depravity of human
Nature; &s;o the Harmony between the Inclination
<PB N="13" REF="299">
and the Occa&s;ion, is a Te&s;timony which leaves
the Pre&s;ence of the evil Spirit with us out of Que|&s;tion.</P>
<P>Not that the Devil is always the Agent in our
Temptations; for tho' the Devil is a very dili|gent
Fellow, and always appears ready to fall
in with the Allurement, yet the Scripture clears
him, and we mu&s;t do &s;o too, of being the main
Tempter; 'tis our own corrupt debauch'd In|clination
which is the fir&s;t moving Agent; and
therefore the Scripture &s;ays, <HI>A Man is tempted,
when he is drawn away of his own Lu&s;ts, and enticed.</HI>
The Devil who, as I &s;aid, is a very diligent Fel|low
in the infernal Work, and is always ready to
forward the Mi&s;chief, is al&s;o a very cunning
Fellow, and knows how mo&s;t dextrou&s;ly to &s;uit
alluring Objects to the allurable Di&s;po&s;itions; to
procure en&s;naring Things, and lay them in the
Way of the Man whom he finds &s;o ea&s;y to be en|&s;nar'd,
and he never fails to prompt all the Mi&s;|chief
he can, full of Stratagem and Art to en|&s;nare
us by the Help of our corrupt Affections,
and the&s;e are call'd <HI>Sathan's Devices.</HI></P>
<P>But having charg'd Sathan home in that Part,
I mu&s;t do the Devil that Ju&s;tice, as to own, that
he is the mo&s;t &s;lander'd, mo&s;t abus'd Creature
alive; Thou&s;ands of Crimes we lay to his Charge
that he is not guilty of; Thou&s;ands of our own
Infirmities we load him with which he has no
Hand in; and Thou&s;ands of our Sins, which, as
bad as he is, he knows nothing of; calling him
our Tempter, and pretending we did &s;o and &s;o,
as the Devil would have it, when on the contrary
the Devil had no Share in it, and we were only
<HI>led away of our own Lu&s;ts, and enticed.</HI></P>
<P>But now, having made this Digre&s;&s;ion in the
Devil's Defence, I return to the main Que&s;tion, that
<PB N="14" REF="300">
of the Being of the Devil, and of evil Spirits; this,
I believe, there is no Room to doubt of; but this,
as I have ob&s;erv'd, is not the Thing; the&s;e are
not the Spirits I am &s;peaking of, but I &s;hall come
directly to what I mean, and &s;peak plain without
any Po&s;&s;ibility of being mi&s;under&s;tood.</P>
<P>I make no Que&s;tion, but that there is not only
a World of Spirits, but that there is a certain
Knowledge of it, tho' to us impo&s;&s;ible as to the
Manner of it; there is a certain Conver&s;e between
the World of Spirits, and the Spirits in this
World; that is to &s;ay, between Spirits unca&s;ed or
unembody'd, and Souls of Men embody'd or ca&s;ed
up in Fle&s;h and Blood, as we all are on this &s;ide Death.</P>
<P>It is true, that we cannot de&s;cribe this Con|ver&s;e
of Spirits, as to the Way of it, the Manner
of the Communication, or how things are mutu|ally
convey'd from one to another. How Intelli|gences
are given or receiv'd we know not; we
know but little of their being convey'd <HI>this Way,</HI>
from the Spirits unembody'd, to ours that are in
Life; and of their being convey'd <HI>that Way,</HI> name|ly,
from us to them; of that we know nothing&punc;
The latter certainly is done without the Help of
the Organ, the former is convey'd by the Under|&s;tanding,
and the retir'd Faculties of the Soul, of
which we can give very little Account.</P>
<Q>For Spirits, without the help of Voice, conver&s;e.</Q>
<P>Let me, however, give, as Rea&s;ons for my Opi|nion,
&s;ome Account of the Con&s;equences of this
Conver&s;e of Spirits; I mean &s;uch as are quite re|mote
from what we call Apparition or Appearance
of Spirits; and I omit the&s;e, becau&s;e I know they
are objected much again&s;t, and they bear much
Scandal from the frequent Impo&s;itions of our Fan|cies
<PB N="15" REF="301">
and Imaginations upon our Judgments and
Under&s;tandings, as above.</P>
<P>But the more particular Di&s;coveries of this Con|ver&s;e
of Spirits, and which to me are undeniable;
are &s;uch as follows; namely,
<LIST>
<ITEM>Dreams,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Voices,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Noi&s;es,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Impul&s;es,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hints,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Apprehen&s;ions,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Involuntary Sad|ne&s;s,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Dreams are dangerous Things to talk of; and
we have &s;uch dreaming about them, that indeed
the lea&s;t Encouragement to lay any Weight upon
'em, is pre&s;ently carry'd away by a &s;ort of People
that dream waking; and that run into &s;uch wild
Extreams about them, that indeed we ought to
be very cautious what we &s;ay of them.</P>
<P>It is certain, Dreams of old were the Ways by
which God him&s;elf was plea&s;ed to warn Men, as
well what to do, as what not to do; what Ser|vices
to perform, what Evils to &s;hun. <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> the
Husband of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> was ap|pear'd
to in both the&s;e, <HI>Matt.</HI> ii. 13. 19. He was
directed of God, in a Dream, to go into <HI>Egypt,</HI>
and he was bid return out of <HI>Egypt</HI> in a Dream;
and in the &s;ame Chapter, the Wi&s;e-men of the
Ea&s;t were <HI>warn'd of God in a Dream,</HI> to depart into
their own Country another Way, to avoid the
Fury of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>Now as this, and innumerable In&s;tances thro' the
whole Scripture, confirm, that God did once make
u&s;e of this Manner to convey Knowledge and In|&s;truction
to Men, I wi&s;h I could have this Que|&s;tion
well an&s;wer'd, (<HI>viz.) Why are we now to&punc; di|rect
People to take no Notice of their Dreams?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="302">
But farther, it appears that this was not only
the Method God him&s;elf took by his immediate
Power, but 'tis evident he made u&s;e of it by the
Mini&s;try of Spirits; the Scripture &s;ays in both the
Ca&s;es of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> above-nam'd, That <HI>the Angel of the
Lord appear'd to</HI> Jo&s;eph <HI>in a Dream.</HI> Now every
unembody'd Spirit is an Angel of the Lord in
&s;ome Sen&s;e, and, as Angels and Spirits may be the
&s;ame thing in re&s;pect of this Influence upon us in
Dreams, &s;o it is &s;till; and when any Notice for
Good, or Warning again&s;t Evil, is given us in a
Dream, I think 'tis no Arrogance at all for us to
&s;ay, the Angel of the Lord appear'd to us in a
Dream; or to &s;ay, &s;ome good Spirit gave me
Warning of this in a Dream; take this which
Way you will.</P>
<P>That I may &s;upport this with &s;uch undeniable
Arguments, drawn from Examples of the Fact, as
no Man will, or rea&s;onably can oppo&s;e, I fir&s;t ap|peal
to the Experience of ob&s;erving People; I
mean &s;uch People as ob&s;erve the&s;e things without
a &s;uper&s;titious Dependence upon the Signification
of them, that look upon Dreams but with &s;uch
a moderate Regard to them, as may direct to a
right U&s;e of them: The Que&s;tion I would ask of
&s;uch is, Whether they have never found any re|markable
Event of their Lives &s;o evidently fore|told
them by a Dream, as that it mu&s;t of Nece&s;|&s;ity
be true, that &s;ome invi&s;ible Being fore&s;aw the
Event, and gave them Notice of it? And that
had that Notice been li&s;ten'd to, and the natural
Prudence u&s;ed, which would have been u&s;ed if it
had been certainly di&s;covered, that evil Event
might have been prevented?</P>
<P>I would ask others, whether they have not, by
Dreams, been &s;o warn'd of Evil really approach|ing,
as that taking the Hint, and making u&s;e of
<PB N="17" REF="303">
the Caution given in tho&s;e Dreams the Evil has
been avoided. If I may &s;peak my own Expe|rience,
I mu&s;t take leave to &s;ay, That I never had
any capital Mi&s;chief befel me in my Life, but I
have had Notice of it by a Dream; and if I had
not been that thoughtle&s;s unbelieving Creature,
which I now would caution other People again&s;t,
I might have taken many a Warning, and avoided
many of the Evils that I afterwards fell into,
merely by a total ob&s;tinate Neglect of tho&s;e
Dreams.</P>
<P>In like Manner, I have in &s;ome of the greate&s;t
Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of my Life, been encouraged to believe
firmly and fully, that I &s;hould one Time or other
be delivered; and I mu&s;t acknowledge, that in my
greate&s;t and mo&s;t hopele&s;s Bani&s;hment, I had &s;uch
frequent Dreams of my Deliverance, that I al|ways
entertained a firm and &s;atisfying Belief, that
my la&s;t Days would be better than my fir&s;t; all
which has effectually come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>From which I cannot determine, <HI>as I know &s;ome
do,</HI> that all Dreams are meet Do&s;ings of a deli|tious
Head, Delu&s;ions of a waking Devil, and Re|licts
of the Day's Thoughts, and Perplexities,
or Plea&s;ures: Nor do I &s;ee any Period of Time
fixed between the two oppo&s;ite Circum&s;tances;
namely, when Dreams were to be e&s;teemed the
Voice of God, and when the Delu&s;ion of the
Devil.</P>
<P>I know &s;ome have &s;truggled hard to fix that
particular Article, and to &s;ettle it as a Thing go|ing
hand in hand with the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> In&s;titutions; as if
the Oracle cea&s;ing in the Temple with the Con|&s;ummation
of the typical Law, all the Methods
which Heaven was plea&s;ed to take in the former
Times for revealing his Will to Men, were to cea&s;e
al&s;o at the &s;ame Time, and the Go&s;pel Revela|tion
<PB N="18" REF="304">
being fully and effectually &s;upplied by the
Mi&s;&s;ion of the Holy Spirit, Dreams and all the
U&s;es and Significations of Dreams were at an
End, and the E&s;teem and Regard to the Warn|ings
and In&s;tructions of Dreams was to expire
al&s;o.</P>
<P>But the Scripture is Point-blank again&s;t this,
in the Hi&s;tory of Fact relating to <HI>Ananias,</HI> and
the Conver&s;ion of St. <HI>Paul;</HI> and in the Story of
St. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Cornelius</HI> the devout Centurion at
<HI>Antioch;</HI> both of them eminent In&s;tances of God's
giving Notice of his Plea&s;ure to Men, by the In|terpo&s;ition
or Medium of a Dream. The fir&s;t of
the&s;e is in <HI>Acts</HI> ix. 10. <HI>There was a certain Di&s;|ciple
at</HI> Dama&s;cus <HI>named</HI> Ananias, <HI>To him &s;aid the
Lord in a Vi&s;ion,</HI> &amp;c. the Words &s;poken in this Vi|&s;ion
to <HI>Ananias,</HI> directing to go to &s;eek out one
<HI>Saul</HI> of <HI>Tar&s;us,</HI> go on thus <HI>v. 12. And hath &s;een in
a Vi&s;ion, a Man named</HI> Ananias <HI>coming in.</HI></P>
<P>The other Pa&s;&s;age is of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Cornelius</HI>
the Centurion, <HI>Acts 10. v.</HI> 3, 10, 11. in the third
Ver&s;e it is &s;aid, <HI>Cornelius</HI> Fa&s;ting and Praying,
<HI>&s;aw a Vi&s;ion,</HI> which afterwards in the 22d Ver&s;e,
is called <HI>an holy Angel warning him,</HI> in the 30th
Ver&s;e it is &s;aid, <HI>a Man &s;tood before me in bright
Cloathing;</HI> at the &s;ame Time, <HI>v.</HI> 10. it is &s;aid,
St. <HI>Peter</HI> was Praying and fell into <HI>a Trance;</HI> this
we will agree to be a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sleep or a deep
Sleep; and in this Traunce 'tis &s;aid, <HI>he &s;aw Hea|ven
opened,</HI> that is to &s;ay, he dreamed that he &s;aw
Heaven opened; it could be nothing el&s;e; for
no Interpreters will offer to in&s;i&s;t that Heaven
was really opened; al&s;o the hearing a Voice, <HI>v.</HI> 13,
15. mu&s;t be in a Dream; thus 'tis apparent the
Will of God concerning what we are to do or not
to do, what is or is not to befal us, is and has
been thus conveyed by Vi&s;ion or Dream, &s;ince the
<PB N="19" REF="305">
Expiration of the <HI>Levitical</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation, and &s;ince
the Mi&s;&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>When then did it cea&s;e? and if we do not
know when it cea&s;ed, how then are we &s;ure it is
at all cea&s;ed, and what Authority have we now
to reject all Dreams or Vi&s;ions of the Night, <HI>as they
are called,</HI> more than formerly?</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay, but there may be more noctur|nal
Delu&s;ions now in the World, than there were
in tho&s;e Times; and perhaps the Devil may have
gain'd more upon Mankind in the&s;e Days, than
he had then, though we are not let into tho&s;e
Things enough, to know whether it is &s;o or not;
nor do we know, that there were not as many un|&s;ignifying
Dreams in tho&s;e Days as now, and per|haps
as much to be &s;aid again&s;t depending upon
them; though I think there is not one Word in
Scripture &s;aid, to take off the Regard Men might
give to Dreams, or to le&s;&s;en the Weight which
they might lay on them.</P>
<P>The only Text that I think looks like it, is the
Flout <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Brethren put upon him, or threw
out at him, when they were &s;peaking of him with
Contempt, <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> xxxvii. 19. <HI>Behold this Dreamer
cometh;</HI> and again, <HI>v. 20. Let us &s;lay him and ca&s;t
him into &s;ome Pit,</HI> and we &s;hall &s;ee <HI>what will be|come
of his</HI> DREAMS.</P>
<P>This indeed looks a little like the pre&s;ent Lan|guage
again&s;t Dreams; but even this, is &s;ufficiently
rebuked in the Con&s;equences, for tho&s;e Dreams of
<HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s did come all to pa&s;s, and proving the &s;u|perior
Influence &s;uch Things have upon the Affairs
of Men, in &s;pight of all the Contempt they can
ca&s;t upon them.</P>
<P>The Maxim I have laid down to my &s;elf for
my Conduct in this Affair is in few Words, that
<PB N="20" REF="306">
we &s;hould not lay too great Stre&s;s upon Dreams,
and yet not wholly neglect them.</P>
<P>I remember, I was once pre&s;ent, where a long
Di&s;pute was warmly carried on between two
Per&s;ons of my Acquaintance upon this very Sub|ject,
the one a Layman, the other a Clergyman,
but both very pious and religious Per&s;ons: The
fir&s;t thought there was no heed at all to be
given to Dreams, that they could have no ju&s;ti|fiable
Original, that they were Delu&s;ions and no
more, that it was Athei&s;tical to lay any Stre&s;s up|on
them, and that he could give &s;uch Objections
again&s;t them, as that no Man of good Principles
could avoid being convinced by; that as to their
being a Communication from the invi&s;ible to the
vi&s;ible World, 'twas a Chimaera, and that he &s;aw
no Foundation for believing any Reality in &s;uch a
Thing, unle&s;s I would &s;et up for a Popi&s;h <HI>Limbus</HI>
or Purgatory, which had no Foundation in the
Scripture.</P>
<P>1. He &s;aid, If Dreams were from the Agency
of any pre&s;cient Being, the Notices would be
more direct, and the Di&s;coveries clear; not by
Allegories and emblematick Fancies, expre&s;&s;ing
Things imperfect and dark: For to what Purpo&s;e
&s;hould Spirits un-embodied &s;port with Mankind,
warning him of approaching Mi&s;chiefs by the
mo&s;t ridiculous Enigmas, Figures, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> leaving
the Wretch to gue&s;s what awaited him, though
of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence, and to peri&s;h if
he mi&s;took the Meaning of it; and leaving
him &s;ometimes perfectly at a Lo&s;s, to know
whether he was Right or Wrong, and without any
Rule of Guide to walk by in the mo&s;t difficult
Ca&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="307">
2. He objected, that with the Notice of Evil,
&s;uppo&s;e it to be rightly under&s;tood, there was not
given a Power to avoid it; and therefore it could
not be alledged, that the Notice was any way
kind, and that it was not likely to proceed from a
beneficent Spirit, but meerly Fortuitous and of
no Significancy.</P>
<P>3. He objected, That if &s;uch Notices as tho&s;e
were of &s;uch Weight, why were they not Con|&s;tant:
But that &s;ometimes they were given, and
&s;ometimes omitted, though Ca&s;es were equally
important; and that therefore they did not &s;eem
to proceed from any Agent, who&s;e Actions were
to be fairly accounted for.</P>
<P>4. He &s;aid, That oftentimes we had very di|&s;tinct
and formal Dreams, without any Significa|tion
at all, that we could neither know any Thing
probable or any Thing rational of them; and that
it would be profane to &s;ugge&s;t that to come from
Heaven, which was too apparently fooli&s;h and
incon&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>5. As Men were not always thus warned, or
&s;upplied with Notices of Good or Evil, &s;o all
Men were not alike &s;upplied with them; and
what Rea&s;on could we give, why one Man or one
Woman &s;hould not have the &s;ame Hints as ano|ther.</P>
<P>The Clergyman gave di&s;tinct An&s;wers to all
the&s;e Objections, and to me, I confe&s;s, very
&s;atisfactory; whether they may be &s;o to tho&s;e that
read them, is no Concern of mine, let every one
judge for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>1. He &s;aid, that as to the Signification of
Dreams, and the Objections again&s;t them, be|cau&s;e
dark and doubtful, that they are expre&s;s'd
generally by Hieroglyphical Repre&s;entations, Si|milies,
Allu&s;ions, and figurative emblematick
<PB N="22" REF="308">
Ways of expre&s;&s;ing Things was true, and that
by this Means, for want of Interpretation, the
Thing was not under&s;tood, and con&s;equently the
Evil not &s;hun'd. This, he &s;aid, was the only
Difficulty that remained to him in the Ca&s;e, but
that he could &s;ee nothing in it again&s;t the Sig|nification
of them, becau&s;e thus it was be|fore;
for Dreams were often allegorick and allu|&s;ive,
when they were evidently from God; and
what the End and De&s;ign of Providence in that
was, we could not pretend to enquire.</P>
<P>2. To the Second he &s;aid, <HI>we charged God foo|li&s;hly,</HI>
to &s;ay he had given the Notice of Evil
without <HI>the Power to avoid it,</HI> which he denied;
and affirmed, that if any one had not Power to
avoid the Evil, it was no Notice to him, that it
was want of giving due Heed to that Notice,
nor for want of the Notice being &s;ufficient that,
any Evil followed, and that Men fir&s;t neglected
them&s;elves, and then charg'd the Judge of all the
Earth with not doing right.</P>
<P>3. Likewi&s;e he &s;aid, the Complaint that the&s;e no|tices
were not con&s;tant, was unju&s;t, for he doubt|ed
not but they were &s;o, but our di&s;cerning was
crazed and clouded by our Negligence in not tak|ing
due Notice of it, that we hoodwink'd our
Under&s;tanding by pretending Dreams were not to
be regarded; and the Voice really &s;poke, but we
refu&s;ed to hear being negligent of our own Good.</P>
<P>4. In the &s;ame Sen&s;e he an&s;wered the Fourth,
and &s;aid, it was a Mi&s;take to &s;ay, that &s;ometimes
Dreams had no Import at all, he &s;aid it was only
to be &s;aid, none that we could perceive the Rea|&s;on
of, which was owing to our Blindne&s;s and &s;u|pine
Negligence to be &s;ecure at one Time, and
our Heads too much alarmed at another; &s;o that
the Spirit which we might be &s;aid to be conver|&s;ing
<PB N="23" REF="309">
with in a Dream, was con&s;tantly and equal|ly
kind and careful, but our Powers, not always in
the &s;ame State of Action, nor equally attentive
to, or retentive of the Hints that were given; or
Things might be rendred more or le&s;s intelligible
to us, as the Powers of our Soul were more or le&s;s
doz'd or &s;omniated with the Oppre&s;&s;ion of Va|pours
from the Body, which occa&s;ions Sleep; for
tho' the Soul cannot be &s;aid to &s;leep it&s;elf, yet
how far its Operations may be limited, and the
Under&s;tanding per&s;cribed by the Sleepine&s;s of the
Body, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I will not undertake, let the Ana|tomi&s;t
judge of it, who can account for the Con|texture
of the Parts, and for their Operations,
which I cannot an&s;wer to.</P>
<P>5. As to the la&s;t Que&s;tion, why People are not
equally &s;upplied with &s;uch Warnings, he &s;aid, this
&s;eem'd to be no Que&s;tion at all in the Ca&s;e; for
Providence it&s;elf might have &s;ome &s;hare in the
Direction of it, and then that Providence might
perhaps be limited by &s;ome &s;uperiour Direction,
the &s;ame that guides all the &s;olemn Di&s;po&s;itions of
Nature, and was a Wind blowing where it li&s;t|eth:
that as to the Conver&s;e of Spirits, tho' he
allowed the Thing it&s;elf, yet he did not tie it up
to a &s;tated Cour&s;e of Conver&s;ing, that it &s;hould
be the &s;ame always, and to all People, and on all
Occa&s;ions; but that it &s;eem'd to be &s;pontaneous,
and con&s;equently Arbitrary, as if the Spirits
unembodied had it left to them to conver&s;e as
they thought fit, how, where, and with whom
they would; that all he an&s;wered for in that Di&s;|cour&s;e
was for the Thing it&s;elf, that &s;uch a Thing
there was, but why there was &s;o much of it, or
why no more, was none of his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and he
believed a Di&s;covery was not yet made to Man|kind
of that Part.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="310">
I thought it would be much to the Purpo&s;e to
remark this Opinion of another Man, becau&s;e it
corre&s;ponded &s;o exactly with my own, but I have
not done with my Friend, for he led me into a|nother
Enquiry, which indeed I had not taken
&s;o much notice of before, and this was introdu|ced
by the following Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>You &s;eem, &s;ays he, to be very inqui&s;itive about
Dreams, and to doubt, <HI>tho' I think you have no
Rea&s;on for it,</HI> of the Reality of the World of Spi|rits,
which Dreams are &s;uch an Evidence of Pray,
&s;ays he, what think you of waking Dreams, Tran|&s;es,
Vi&s;ions, Noi&s;es, Voices, Hints, Impul&s;es,
and all the&s;e waking Te&s;timonies of an invi&s;ible
World, and of the Communication that there is
between us and them, which are generally enter|tained
with our Eyes open.</P>
<P>This led me into many Reflections upon pa&s;t
Things, which I had been Witne&s;s to as well in
my&s;elf as in other People, and particularly in my
former Solitudes, when I had many Occa&s;ions to
mark &s;uch Things as the&s;e; and I could not but
entertain a free Conver&s;ation with my Friend up|on
this Subject, as often as I had Opportunity,
of which I mu&s;t give &s;ome Account.</P>
<P>I had one Day been conver&s;ing &s;o long with
him upon the common received Notions of the
planets being habitable, and of a Diver&s;ity of
Worlds, that I think verily, I was for &s;ome Days
like a Man tran&s;ported into the&s;e Regions my&s;elf;
whether my Imagination is more addicted to real|lizing
the Things I talk of, as if they were in
View, I know not; or whether by the Power of
the Conver&s;e of Spirits I &s;peak of, I was at that
Time enabled to entertain clearer Ideas of the
Invi&s;ible World, I really cannot tell; but I cer|tainly
made a Journey to all tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed ha|bitable
<PB N="25" REF="311">
Bodies in my Imagination, and I know
not but it may be very u&s;eful to tell you what I
met with in my Way, and what the wi&s;er I am
for the Di&s;covery; whether you will be the wi&s;er
for the Relation at &s;econd Hand, I cannot an&s;wer
for that.</P>
<P>I could make a long Di&s;cour&s;e here of the Pow|er
of Imagination, and how bright the Ideas of
Di&s;tant Things may be found in the Mind, when
the Soul is more than ordinarily agitated: It is
certain the extraordinary Intelligence conveyed in
this Manner is not always regular, &s;ometimes it is
exceeding confu&s;ed, and the Brain being not able
to dige&s;t it, turns round too fa&s;t; this tends to Lu|nacy
and Di&s;traction, and the Swiftne&s;s of the Mo|tion
the&s;e Ideas come in with, occa&s;ions a Com|motion
in Nature, the under&s;tanding is mobb'd
with them, di&s;turb'd, runs from one Thing to ano|ther,
and dige&s;ts nothing; this is well expre&s;&s;ed
in our common Way of talking of a mad Man,
namely, that his Head is turned. Indeed I can
liken it to nothing &s;o well as to the Wheels of a
Wind-mill, which if the Sails or Wings are &s;et,
and the Wind blow a Storm, run round &s;o fa&s;t, that
they will &s;et all on Fire, it a skilful Hand be not
ready to direct and manage it.</P>
<P>But not to enter upon this whym&s;ical De&s;cription
of Lunacy, which perhaps may be no Bodies Opi|nion
but my own, I proceed thus. That when the
Head is &s;trong, and capable of the Impre&s;&s;ions;
when the Under&s;tanding is impowered to dige&s;t
the infinite Variety of Ideas, which pre&s;ent to it
from the extended Fancy; then, I &s;ay, the Soul of
Man is capable of act &s;trangely upon the Invi&s;ibles
in Nature, and upon Futurity, Reallizing every
Thing to it&s;elf in &s;uch a lively Manner, that what
it thus thinks of, it really &s;ees, &s;peaks to, hears,
<PB N="26" REF="312">
conver&s;es with, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as livelily, as if the Sub&s;tance
was really before his Face; and this is what I
mean by tho&s;e that dream waking, by Vi&s;ions,
Trances, or what you plea&s;e to call them; for it is
not nece&s;&s;ary to this Part, that the Man &s;hould
be a&s;leep.</P>
<P>I return to my Share of the&s;e Things. It was
after my conver&s;ing with my learned Friend a|bout
the heavenly Bodies, the Motion, the Di|&s;tances,
and the Bulk of the Planets, their Si|tuation,
and the Orbits they move in, the
Share of Light, Heat and Moi&s;ture, which they
enjoy, their Re&s;pect to the Sun, their Influences
upon us, and at la&s;t, the Po&s;&s;ibility of their being
habitable, with all the Arcana of the Skies; it
was on this Occa&s;ion, I &s;ay, that my Imagination,
<HI>always given to wander,</HI> took a Flight of its own;
and as I have told you that I had an invincible
Inclination to travel, &s;o I think I travelled as &s;en|&s;ibly,
to my under&s;tanding, over all the Mazes
and Wa&s;tes of infinite Space, in Que&s;t of tho&s;e
Things, as ever I did over the De&s;arts of <HI>Ka|rakathay,</HI>
and the uninhabited Wa&s;ts of <HI>Tratary,</HI>
and perhaps may give as u&s;eful an Account of
my Journey.</P>
<P>When fir&s;t my Fancy rais'd me up in the Con|fines
of this va&s;t Aby&s;s, and having now tra|velled
thro' the mi&s;ty Regions of the Atmo|&s;phere
could look down as I mounted, and &s;ee the
World below me, tis &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to ima|gine,
how little, how mean, how de&s;picable every
Thing look'd; let any Man but try this Experi|ment
of him&s;elf, and he &s;hall certainly find the
&s;ame Thing; let him but fix his Thoughts &s;o in|ten&s;ly
upon what is, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;een
in a Stage or two higher, than where we now
live removed from the particular Conver&s;e with
<PB N="27" REF="313">
the World, as to reallize to his Imagination what
he can &s;uppo&s;e to be there, he &s;hall find all that
is below him, as di&s;tant Objects always do,
le&s;&s;en in his Mind as they do in his Sight.</P>
<P>Could a Man &s;ub&s;i&s;t without a &s;upply of Food,
and live but one Mile in perpendicular Height from
the Surface, he would de&s;pi&s;e Life and the World
at &s;uch a Rate, that he would hardly come down
to have it be all his own; the Soul of Man is
capable of being continually elevated above the
very Thoughts of human Things, is capable of
travelling up to the highe&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;tant Re|gions
of Light, but when it does, as it ri&s;es a|bove
the earthly Globe, &s;o the Things of this
Globe &s;ink to him.</P>
<P>When I was at fir&s;t lifted up in my imaginary
Travels, this was the fir&s;t Thing of Moment I
remarked; namely, how little the World and every
Thing about it &s;eemed to me: I am not given to
preach or drawing long Corollaries as the Learned
call them, but I commend it to my Friends to ob|&s;erve,
that could we always look upon the Things
of Life with the &s;ame Eyes, as we &s;hall do when
we come to the Edge of Time, when one Eye can
as it were look back on the World, and the other
look forward into Eternity, we &s;hould &s;ave our|&s;elves
the Trouble of much Repentance, and
&s;hould &s;corn to touch many of tho&s;e Things, in
which now we fancy our chief Felicity is laid up;
believe me we &s;hall &s;ee more with half an Eye
then, and judge better at fir&s;t Glance, than we
can now with all our pretended Wi&s;dom and Pe|$etration.
In a Word, all the Pa&s;&s;ions and Af|fections
&s;uffer a general Change upon &s;uch a View,
and what we de&s;ire before, we contemn then with
Abhorrence.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="314">
Having begun to &s;oar, the World was &s;oon out
of Sight, unle&s;s that as I ro&s;e higher, and could
look at her in a due Po&s;ition as to the Sun, I could
&s;ee her turned into a Moon, and &s;hine by Refle|ction:
<HI>Ay, &s;hine ou,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>with thy borrowed Rays,
for thou ha&s;t but very few of thy own.</HI></P>
<P>When my Fancy had mounted me thus beyond
the Ve&s;tiges of the Earth, and leaving the Atmo&s;|phere
behind me, I had &s;et my firm Foot upon the
Verge of Infinite, when I drew no Breath,
but &s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon pure <HI>Aether,</HI> it is not po&s;&s;ible
to expre&s;s fully the Vi&s;ion of the Place; fir&s;t you
are to conceive of Sight as unconfin'd, and you
&s;ee here at lea&s;t the whole &s;olar Sy&s;tem at one View&punc;
Nor is your Sight bounded by the narrow Cir|cumference
of one Sun, and its Attendants of Pla|nets,
who&s;e Orbits are appropriated to its proper
Sy&s;tem, but above and beyond, and on every Side
you &s;ee innumerable Suns, and attending on them,
Planets, Satellites, and inferior Lights proper
to their re&s;pective Sy&s;tems, and all the&s;e mov|ing
in their &s;ubordinate Circum&s;tances, without the
lea&s;t Confu&s;ion, with glorious Light and Splendor
inconceivable.</P>
<P>In this fir&s;t Di&s;covery 'tis mo&s;t natural to ob|&s;erve,
how plainly it is to be &s;een, that the Rea&s;on
of the Creation of &s;uch immen&s;e Bodies as the Sun,
Stars, Planets, and Moons in the great Circle of
the lower Heaven, is far from being to be found in
the Study of Nature, on the Surface of our Earth:
But he that will &s;ee thorowly, why God has formd
the Heavens the Work of his Hands, and the
Moon and the Stars which he has made, mu&s;t &s;oar
up higher; and then as he will &s;ee with other Eyes
than he did before, &s;o he will &s;ee the God of Na|ture
has form'd an infinite Variety which we know
<PB N="29" REF="315">
nothing of, and that all the Creatures are a Rea|&s;on
to one another for their Creation.</P>
<P>I could not forget my&s;elf however, when I was
got up thus high, I &s;ay, I could not but look back
upon the State of Man in this Life, how confined
from the&s;e Di&s;coveries, how vilely employed in
biting and devouring, envying, and maligning one
another, and all for the vile&s;t Trifles that can be
conceived.</P>
<P>But I was above it all here, and all tho&s;e Things
which appeared &s;o afflicting before, gave me not
the lea&s;t Concern now; for the Soul being gone of
this Errand, had quite different Notices of the
whole State of Life, and was neither influenced
by Pa&s;&s;ions or Affections as it was before.</P>
<P>Here I &s;aw into many Things by the Help of a
&s;edate Inquiry, that we can entertain little or no
Notion of in a State of common &s;uperficial
Life, and I de&s;ire to leave a few Remarks of this
imaginary Journey, as I did of my ordinary Tra|vels.</P>
<P>When I came, I &s;ay, to look into the &s;olar
Sy&s;tem as I have hinted, I &s;aw perfectly the Emp|tine&s;s
of our modern Notions, that the Planets
were habitable Worlds, and &s;hall give a brief
De&s;cription of the Ca&s;e, that others may &s;ee it
too, without the Nece&s;&s;ity of taking &s;o long a
Journey.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t for the Word Habitable, I under&s;tand
the meaning of it to be, that the Place it is &s;po|ken
of, is qualify'd for the Sub&s;i&s;tence and Exi|&s;tence
of Man and Bea&s;t, and to pre&s;erve the vege|tative
and &s;en&s;itive Life; and you may depend up|on
it, that none of the Planets except the Moon,
are in this Sen&s;e habitable; and the Moon, a poor
little watery damp Thing, not above as big as
<HI>York&s;hire,</HI> neither worth being called a World, nor
<PB N="30" REF="316">
capable of rendring Life comfortable to Mankind,
if indeed &s;upportable; and if you will believe
one's Mind capable of &s;eeing at &s;o great a Di|&s;tance,
I a&s;&s;ure you I did not &s;ee Man, Woman or
Child there in all my Contemplative Voyage to
it; my Meaning is, I did not &s;ee the lea&s;t Rea|&s;on
to believe there was or could be any there. As
to the re&s;t of the Planets, I'll take them in their
Order. <HI>Saturn,</HI> (the remote&s;t from the Sun, which
is in the Centre of the Sy&s;tem,) is a va&s;t extended
Globe, of a Sub&s;tance cold and moi&s;t, its greate&s;t
Degree of Light is never &s;o much as our greate&s;t
Darkne&s;s may be &s;aid to be in clear Weather, and
its cold un&s;ufferable; and if it were a Body com|po&s;ed
of the &s;ame Elements as our Earth, its Sea
would be all Bra&s;s, and its Earth all Iron; that
is to &s;ay, both would be continually frozen, as
the North-Pole in the Winter Sol&s;tice. What Man
or Men, and of what Nature, could inhabit this
frigid Planet, unle&s;s the Creator mu&s;t be &s;up|po&s;ed
to have created animal Creatures for the
Climate, not the Climate for the Creatures. All
the Notions of <HI>Saturns</HI> being a habitable World,
are contrary to Nature, and incongruous with Sen&s;e;
for <HI>Saturn</HI> is at &s;o infinite a Di&s;tance from the
Sun, that it has not above one ninetieth Part of
the Light and Heat that we enjoy on our Earth;
&s;o that the Light there, may be &s;aid to be much
le&s;s than our Star-light, and the cold ninety Times
greater than the colde&s;t Day in our Winter.</P>
<P><HI>Jupiter</HI> is in the &s;ame Predicament, his Con&s;ti|tution,
however in its Degree much milder than
<HI>Saturn,</HI> yet certainly is not qualify'd for human
Bodies to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, having only one twenty-&s;eventh
Part of the Light and Heat that we enjoy here,
con&s;equently its Light is at be&s;t as dim as our
Twilight, and its Heat &s;o little in the Summer of
<PB N="31" REF="317">
its Situation, as to be as far from comfortable, as
it is in its Winter Situation in&s;upportable.</P>
<P><HI>Mars,</HI> If you will believe our ancient Philo&s;o|phers,
is a fiery Planet in the very Di&s;po&s;ition of
its Influence, as well as by the Cour&s;e of its Mo|tion;
and yet even here, the Light is not above
one Half, and its Heat one Third of ours. And
on the other Hand, as <HI>Saturn</HI> is cold and moi&s;t,
&s;o this Planet is hot and dry, and would admite
no Habitation of Man, through the manife&s;t In|temperance
of the Air, as well as want of Light
to make it comfortable, and Moi&s;ture to make it
fruitful; for by the Nature of the Planet, as well
as by clear-&s;ighted Ob&s;ervation, there is never
any Rain, Vapour, Fog, or Dew in that Pla|net.</P>
<P><HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Mercury</HI> are in the extreme the other
Way, and would de&s;troy Nature by their Heat
and dazling Light, as the other would by their
Darkne&s;s and Cold, &s;o that you may depend up|on
it, I could &s;ee very clearly, that all the&s;e Bo|dies
were neither inhabited or habitable; and the
Earth only as we call it, being &s;eated between the&s;e
Intemperances appeared habitable, &s;urrounded
with an Atmo&s;phere to defend it, from the Inva|&s;ion
of the incon&s;i&s;tent <HI>Aether,</HI> in which Per&s;piration
could not be performed by the Lungs, and by
which the needful Vapour it &s;ends forth, is pre|&s;erv'd
from di&s;&s;ipating into the Wa&s;te and Aby&s;s,
and is conden&s;ed and timely returns in Showers of
Rain to moi&s;ten, cool, and nouri&s;h the exhau&s;ted
Earth.</P>
<P>It is true the Way I went was no common
Road, yet I found Abundance of Pa&s;&s;engers go|ing
to and fro here, and particularly innumerable
Armies of good and evil Spirits, who all &s;eem'd
bu&s;ily employed, and continually upon the Wing, as
<PB N="32" REF="318">
if &s;ome Expre&s;&s;es pa&s;s'd between the Earth, which
in this Part of my Travels I place below me, and
&s;ome Country infinitely beyond all that I could
reach the Sight of; for by the Way, though I
take, upon me in this &s;ublime Journey to &s;ee a
great deal of the invi&s;ible World, yet I was not
arrived to a Length to &s;ee into any Part of the
World of Light, beyond it all; that Vi&s;ion is
beyond all, and I pretend to &s;ay nothing of it
here, except this only, that a clear View of this
Part with Opticks unclouded is a great Step to
prepare the Mind for a Look into the other.</P>
<P>But to return to my Station in the highe&s;t crea|ted
World, flatter not your&s;elves that tho&s;e Re|gions
are uninhabited, becau&s;e the Planets ap|pear
to be &s;o. No, no, I a&s;&s;ure you this is that
World of Spirits, or at lea&s;t is a World of Spirits.</P>
<P>Here I &s;aw a clear Demon&s;tration of Satan be|ing
<HI>the Prince of the Power of the Air;</HI> 'tis in this
boundle&s;s Wa&s;te he is confined, whether it be his
bu&s;ie re&s;tle&s;s Inclination has po&s;ted him here, that
he may affront God in his Government of the
World, and do Injury to Mankind in meer Envy
to his Happine&s;s, as the fam'd Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> &s;ays it,
or whether it is that by the eternal Decree of Pro|vidence
he is appointed to be Mans continual
Di&s;turber for divine Ends, to us unknown; this
I had not wandred far enough to be informed of,
tho&s;e Secrets being lodged much higher, than I|magination
it&s;elf ever travelled.</P>
<P>But here, I &s;ay, I found Sathan keeping his
Court, or Camp we may call it, which we plea&s;e.
The innumerable Legions that attended his im|mediate
Service were &s;uch, that it is not at all to
be wondred that he &s;upplied every Angle of this
World, and had his Work going forward, not in
every Country only, but even in every individual
<PB N="33" REF="319">
Inhabitant of it, with all the Dexterity and Appli|cation
imaginable.</P>
<P>This Sight gave me a ju&s;t Idea of the Devil
as a Tempter, but really let me into a Secret,
which I did not &s;o well know before, or at lea&s;t
did not con&s;ider; namely, that the Devil is not
capable of doing half the Mi&s;chief in the World
that we lay to his Charge; that he works by En|gines
and Agents, Stratagems and Art is true, and
a great deal is owing to his Vigilance and Ap|plication;
for he is a very diligent Fellow in his
Calling: But 'tis plain, his Power is not &s;o great
as we imagine, he can only prompt to the Crime,
he cannot force us to commit it; &s;o that if we &s;in
'tis all our own, the Devil is only to be charged
with the Art of In&s;inuation; ju&s;t as he began with
<HI>Eve,</HI> he goes on with us; in &s;hort he rea&s;ons us
out of our Re&s;olutions to do well, and wheedles us
to an Agreement to do ill; working us up to an
Opinion, that what Evil we are about to do is no
Sin, or not &s;o great a Sin as we feared, and &s;o
draws us by Art into the Crime we had re&s;olved
again&s;t; this indeed the Scripture intimates when
it &s;peaks of <HI>Satan's Devices,</HI> the <HI>Subtilty of the
wicked one, his lying in wait,</HI> &amp;c. But to charge
the Devil with forcing us to offend, is doing the
Devil a great Deal of Wrong: Our doing Evil is
from the native Propen&s;ity of our Wills: <HI>Huma|mun
e&s;t peccare.</HI> I will not enter here into the Di&s;|pute
about an original Corruption in Nature, which
I know many good Men and learned Men di&s;pute,
but that there is a &s;ecret Aptne&s;s to offend, and a
&s;ecret Backwardne&s;s to what is Good, which if
it is not born with us, we can give no Account how
we came by, this I think every Man will grant;
and that this is the Devil that tempts us, the Scrip|ture
plainly tells us, when it &s;ays, <HI>Every Man is
<PB N="34" REF="320">
tempted when he is drawn away of his own Lu&s;t and
enticed.</HI></P>
<P>There is a &s;ecret Love of Folly and Vanity in
the Mind, and Mankind are hurry'd down the
Stream of their own Affections into Crime, 'tis
agreeable to them to do this, and 'tis a Force up|on
Nature not to do it.</P>
<Q><L>Vice is down Hill, and when we do offend,</L>
<L>'Tis Nature all, we act as we intend.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Vertue's up Hill, and all again&s;t the Grain</L>
<L>Re&s;olv'd reluctant, and pur&s;ued with Pain.</L></Q>
<P>But to return to the Devil; his Power not
extending to Creation, and being not able to force
the World into an open Rebellion again&s;t Heaven,
as doubtle&s;s he would do if he could, he is left to
the Exerci&s;e of his Skill; and in a Word we may
&s;ay of him, <HI>that he lives by his Wits;</HI> that is to &s;ay,
maintains his Kingdom by Subtilty and mo&s;t ex|quifire
Cunning; and if my Vi&s;ion of his Poli|ticks
is not a new Di&s;covery, I am very much
mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>His innumerable Legions as I hinted above, like
<HI>Aid du Camps</HI> to a General, are continually em|ployed
to carry his Orders, and execute his Com|mi&s;&s;ions
in all Parts of the World, and in every in|dividual
to oppo&s;e the Authority of God, and the
Felicity of Man to the utmo&s;t of his Power.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and greate&s;t Part of his Government,
is over tho&s;e Savage Nations where he has obtain|ed
to &s;et him&s;elf up as God, and to be wor&s;hipped
in&s;tead of God; and I ob&s;erved, that though ha|ving
full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e People, even by whole
Nations as a Time, that is the ea&s;ie&s;t Part of his
<PB N="35" REF="321">
Government, yet he is far from neglecting his Inte|re&s;t
there, but is exceeding vigilant to keep up his
Authority among tho&s;e People. This he does
by &s;ending Me&s;&s;engers into tho&s;e Parts to an&s;wer
the <HI>Pawawings</HI> or Conjurings, even of the mo&s;t
ignorant old Wizard, rai&s;ing Storms and making
Noi&s;es and Shreiks in the Air, Fla&s;hes of infernal
Fire, and any Thing but to fright the People,
that they may not forget him, and that they may
have <HI>no other Gods but him.</HI></P>
<P>He has his peculiar Agents for this Work,
which he makes Detachments of, as his Occa&s;ions,
require, &s;ome to one Part of the World, &s;ome to
another, as to the North <HI>America,</HI> even as far as
to the frozen Provinces of <HI>Groenland;</HI> to the North
of <HI>Europe,</HI> to the <HI>Laplanders, Samoiedes,</HI> and <HI>Mon|gul-Tartars,</HI>
al&s;o to the <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog</HI> of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI>
and to the Devil-makers of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI>
again to the Southern Parts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> to the I&s;les
of the <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>South Seas,</HI> and to the South
Part of <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>Through all the&s;e Parts he has an uncontroull'd
Power, and is either wor&s;hipped in Per&s;on, or by
his Repre&s;entatives, the Idols and Mon&s;ters which
the poor People bow down to, and <HI>Satan</HI> has very
little Trouble with them.</P>
<P>He employs indeed &s;ome Millions of his Mi&s;&s;io|naries
into tho&s;e Countries, who labour <HI>ad propa|gand.
fid.</HI> and fail not to return and bring him an
Account of their Succe&s;s, and I doubt not but
&s;ome of them were at Hand in my I&s;land, when
the Savages appear'd there; for it the Devil had
not been in them, they would hardly have come
&s;traggling over the Sea &s;o far, to devour one
another.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="322">
In all the&s;e Countries the Brutality, the Cruelty
and ravenous bloody Di&s;po&s;itions of the People, is
to me a certain Te&s;timony that the Devil has full
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>But to return to my Ob&s;ervations in the exalted
State of my Fancy, I mu&s;t tell you, that though
the Devil carried on his Schemes of Government,
in tho&s;e blinded Parts of the World with great
Ea&s;e, and all Things went to his Mind; I found
he had more Difficulty in the northern Parts of
the temperate Zone, I mean, our Climate and
the re&s;t of Chri&s;tendom, and con&s;equently he did
not act here by whole Squadrons and by Generals;
but was obliged to carry on his Bu&s;ine&s;s among us
by particular Solicitations, to act by particular
Agents upon particular Per&s;ons, attacking the
per&s;onal Conduct of Men in a Manner peculiar to
him&s;elf: But &s;o far was this Difficulty from being
any Advantage to the World, or Di&s;advantage to
the Devil, that it only obliged him to make U&s;e
of the more Engines; and as he had no want of
Numbers, I ob&s;erved that his whole Clan &s;eemed
bu&s;y on this Side, the Number of which con&s;i&s;ts
of innumerable M$llions; &s;o that in &s;hort, there
was not a Devil wanting, no, not to manage eve|ry
individual Man, Woman, and Child in the
World.</P>
<P>How and in what Manner evil Angels attend us,
what their Bu&s;ine&s;s, how far their Power extends,
and how far it is re&s;trained, and by who, were all
made plain to me at one View in this State of
<HI>$word$</HI> that I &s;tood in now, and I will de|&s;cribe
it if I can in a few Heads of Fact; you may
enlarge upon them us Experience guides.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="323">
And fir&s;t, the Limitations of the Devil's Power,
are nece&s;&s;ary to be under&s;tood, and how di$ected;
<HI>for Example,</HI> you mu&s;t know, that though the
Numbers of the&s;e Evil Spirits, which are thus
diligently employed in Mi&s;chief, are &s;o infinitely
great, yet the Numbers of good Angels or good
Spirits, which are employed by a &s;uperior Au|thority,
and from a Place infinitely di&s;tant and
high above the Devils bounds, is not only equal;
I &s;ay, equal at lea&s;t in Number, but infinitely &s;u|perior
in Power, and it is this Particular which
makes it plain, that all the Devil does, or that his
Agents can do, is by continual Subtilty, extreme
Vigilance and Application, under infinite Checks,
Rebukes, and Callings off by the attendant Spi|rits,
who have Power to correct and re&s;train him.
upon all Occa&s;ions; ju&s;t as a Man does a Dog or
a Thief when he is di&s;covered.</P>
<P>On this Account, 'tis fir&s;t plain, I &s;ay, that the
Devil can do nothing by Force, he cannot kill,
maim, hurt or de&s;troy; if he could, Mankind
would have but a very precarious State of Life in
the World: Nay, the Devil cannot bla&s;t the Fruits
of the Earth, cau&s;e Dearth, Droughts, Famine,
or Scarcity, neither can he &s;pread noxious Fumes
in the Air to infect the World; if any of tho&s;e
Things were in his Power, he would &s;oon unpeo|ple
God's Creation, and put his Maker to the
Nece&s;&s;ity of a new FIAT, or of having no more
human Creatures to wor&s;hip and honour him.</P>
<P>You will ask me, how I came to know all this?
&s;ay, ask me no Que&s;tions, till the Elevation
of your Fancy carries you up to the outer Edge of
the Atmo&s;phere, as I tell you mine did: There
you will &s;ee the Prince of the Air in his full State,
managing his univer&s;al Empire with the mo&s;t exqui|&s;ite
Art: But if ever you can come to a clear View
<PB N="38" REF="324">
of his Per&s;on, do but look narrowly, and you'll
&s;ee a great Clog at his Foot, in token of his li|mited
Power, and though he is him&s;elf immen&s;e in
Bulk, and moves like a Fiery Meteor in the Air,
yet you always &s;ee a Hand with a Thunderbolt
impending ju&s;t over his Head; the Arm coming
out of a fiery Cloud, which is a Token of the Sen|tence
he is under, that at the End of his appointed
Time that Cloud &s;hall break, and that Hand &s;trike
him with the Thunder repre&s;ented, Down, Down
for ever, into a Place prepared for him.</P>
<P>But all this does not hinder him, who is
prompted by infernal Rage again&s;t the Kingdom
of God, and the Welfare of Man, from pu&s;hing
Mankind as above, upon all the Methods of their
own Ruin and De&s;truction, by alluring Baits, cun|ning
Artifice, Night-whi&s;pers, infu&s;ing wicked De|&s;ires,
and fanning the Flames of Men's Lu&s;ts,
Pride, Avarice, Ambition, Revenge, and all the
wicked Excur&s;ions of corrupt Nature.</P>
<P>It would take up a long Tract by it&s;elf, to form
a Sy&s;tem of the Devil's Politicks, and to lay down
a Body of his Philo&s;ophy: I ob&s;erv'd how|ever,
that &s;ome of his general Rules are &s;uch as
the&s;e.</P>
<P>1. To infu&s;e Notions of Liberty into the
Minds of Men; that it is hard they &s;hould be
born into the World with Inclinations, and then be
forbidden to gratify them; that &s;uch and &s;uch
Plea&s;ures &s;hould be prepar'd in the Nature of
Things, made &s;uitable and proper to the Sen&s;es
and Faculties, which on the other Hand, are pre|pared
in mere Con&s;titution, and placed in his
Soul, and that then he &s;hould be forbidden under
the Penalty of a Cur&s;e to ta&s;te them; that to place
an Appetite in the Man, and a &s;trong powerful
Gu&s;t to the&s;e Delights, and then declare them fa|tal
<PB N="39" REF="325">
to him, would be laying a Snare to Man|kind
in his very Con&s;titution, and making his
brighte&s;t Faculties be the Betrayers of his Soul to
Mi&s;ery, which would not con&s;i&s;t with Ju&s;tice,
much le&s;s with the Goodne&s;s of a Creator.</P>
<P>2. To per&s;uade from hence, that the Notions
of future Puni&s;hments are Fables and Amu&s;e|ments,
that it is not rational to think a ju&s;t God
would prepare infinite and eternal Puni&s;hments,
for finite and trivial Offences; that God does not
take Notice of the minute acts of Life, and lay
every Slip to our Charge, but that the merciful
Di&s;po&s;itions of God, who &s;o bountifully directs
the whole World to be a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the Profit and
Delight of Mankind, has certainly given him
leave to enjoy it at fill, and take the Comfort of
it without fear.</P>
<P>3. Of late indeed the Devil has learn'd, <HI>for De|vils
may improve as well as Men in the Arts of doing
ill.</HI> At la&s;t, I &s;ay, he has learned to infu&s;e a wild
Notion into the Heads of &s;ome People, who are
fir&s;t fitted for it, by having rea&s;oned them&s;elves in
Favour of their loo&s;e De&s;ires up to a Pitch, that
there is no &s;uch Thing as a God or a future State
at all.</P>
<P>Now as at fir&s;t the Devil was not Fool enough
to attempt to put this Je&s;t upon Man, his own
Antiquity and Eternity being a Contradiction to it;
&s;o I found among my new Di&s;coveries, that the Devil
took this Ab&s;urdity from Man him&s;elf, and that it
went among Satan's People for a new Invention: I
found al&s;o that there was a black I arty employ'd
upon this new Subtilty, the&s;e were a Sort of De|vils,
for Satan never wants Instruments, who were
call'd <HI>In&s;iauators,</HI> and who were formerly employed
to prompt Men to Crimes by Dreams; and here I
&s;hall ob&s;erve, that I learned a Way how to make
<PB N="40" REF="326">
any Man dream of what I plea&s;e: <HI>For Example,</HI>
&s;uppo&s;e one to be &s;ound a&s;leep, or as we &s;ay, in a
deep Sleep, or dead a&s;leep, let another lay his
Mouth clo&s;e to his Ear, and whi&s;per any Thing
to him &s;o &s;oftly as not to awaken him, the &s;leep|ing
Man &s;hall certainly dream of what was &s;o
Whi&s;pered to him.</P>
<P>Let to Man de&s;pi&s;e this Hint, nothing is more
&s;ure, than that many of our Dreams are the Wi&s;|pers
of the Devil, who by his <HI>In&s;inuators</HI> whi&s;pers
into our Heads, what wicked Things he wou'd
have our Thoughts entertain and work upon; and
take this with you as you go, tho&s;e in&s;inuating
Devils can do this as well when we are awake, as
when we are a&s;leep, and this will bring me to
what I call <HI>Impul&s;es upon the Mind,</HI> which are cer|tainly
whi&s;pers in the Ear and no other, and come
either from good Angels attending us, or from the
Devil's <HI>In&s;inuators,</HI> which are always at hand, and
may be Judged of according as the Subject our
Thoughts are prompted to work upon, are Good
or Evil.</P>
<P>From whence but from the&s;e In&s;inuators, come
our cau&s;ele&s;s Pa&s;&s;ions, our involuntary Wickedne&s;s,
&s;inning in De&s;ire as effectually, as by actual com|mitting
the Crime we de&s;ire to commit?</P>
<P>Whence comes Imagination to work upon
wicked and vicious Objects, when the Per&s;on is
fa&s;t a&s;leep, and when he had not been under the
Preparation of wicked Di&s;cour&s;e, or wicked
Thoughts previous to tho&s;e Imaginations? who
forms Ideas in the Mind of Man? who pre&s;ents
beautiful or terrible Figures to his Fancy, when
his Eyes are clos'd with Sleep? who, but the&s;e in|&s;inuating
Devils, who invi&s;ibly approach the
Man &s;leeping or waking, and whi&s;per all man|ner
of lewd abominable Things into his Mind.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="327">
Mr. <HI>Milton,</HI> who&s;e Imagination was carried up
to a greater Height than I am now, went farther
into the Aby&s;s of Satan's Empire a great Way,
e&s;pecially when he form'd Satan's Palace of <HI>Pande|monium,
I &s;ay,</HI> he was exactly of this Opinion, when
he repre&s;ented the Devil tempting our Mother <HI>Eve,</HI>
in the Shape of a Toad lying ju&s;t at her Ear. when
&s;he lay fa&s;t a&s;leep in her Bower, where he whi&s;per'd
to her Ear all the wicked Things which &s;he en|tertained
Notions of by Night, and which
prompted her the next Day to break the great Com|mand,
which was the rule of her Life; and ac|cordingly
he brings in <HI>Eve telling Adam</HI> what an
unea&s;y Night's Re&s;t &s;he had, and relating her
Dream to him.</P>
<P>This Thought, however laid down in a kind of
Je&s;t, is very &s;eriou&s;ly intended, and would, if well
dige&s;ted, direct us very clearly in our Judgment of
Dreams; <HI>viz.</HI> not to &s;ugge&s;t them to be always
Things of meer Chance; but that &s;ometimes they
are to be heeded as u&s;eful Warnings of Evil or
Good by the Agency of good Spirits, as at other
Times they are the artful In&s;inuations of the De|vil
to inject wicked Thoughts and abhorr'd abo|minable
Ideas into the Mind; which we ought not
only as much as po&s;&s;ible to guard again&s;t, but even
to repent of, &s;o far as the Mind may have enter|tained
and acted upon them.</P>
<P>From this general Vi&s;ion of the Devil's Ma|nagement
of his Affairs, which I mu&s;t own I have
had with my Eyes wide open, I find a great many
u&s;eful Ob&s;ervations to be made; and fir&s;t, it can
be no longer &s;trange, that while the Commerce of
Evil Spirits is &s;o free, and the intercour&s;e between
this World and that, is thus open, I &s;ay, it can be
no longer &s;trange, that there are &s;o many &s;ilent
<PB N="42" REF="328">
Ways of Spirits conver&s;ing, I mean Spirits of
all Kinds.</P>
<P>For as I have ob&s;erved already, there is a Re&s;i|dence
of good Spirits, but they are placed infinite|ly
higher out of the Reach, and out of the Sight of
this lower Orbit of Satan's Kingdom; as
tho&s;e pa&s;s and repa&s;s invi&s;ible, I confe&s;s, I have
yet had no Ideas of them, but tho&s;e which I have
received from my fir&s;t View of the infernal Re|gion:
If I &s;hould have any &s;uperior Elevations,
and &s;hould be able to &s;ee the O Economy of Heaven
in his Di&s;po&s;ition of Things on Earth, I &s;hall be
as careful to convey them to Po&s;terity as they
come in.</P>
<P>However, the Tran&s;actions of good Spirits with
Man are certainly the &s;ame; for as God has for
a Protection and Safeguard to Mankind, limited
the Devil from affrighting him, by vi&s;ible Appear|ances
in his native and helli&s;h Deformity, and the
horrrid Shape he would nece&s;&s;arily bear: So for
Man's Felicity, even the glorious Angels of Hea|ven
are very &s;eldom allowed, at lea&s;t not lately,
to appear in the glorious Forms they formerly
took, or indeed in any Form, or with a Voice;
the re&s;traint of our Souls in the Ca&s;e of Fle&s;h and
Blood we now wear not admitting it, and not
being able to familiarize tho&s;e Things to us; Man
being by no Means, in his encorporated State, qua|lified
for an open and ea&s;y Conver&s;ation with un|embodied
Spirit.</P>
<P>Moreover, this would be breaking into the
Limits, which the Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of God
has put to our pre&s;ent State, I mean as to Futurity,
our Ignorance in which, is the greate&s;t Felicity of
human Life; and without which nece&s;&s;ary Blind|ne&s;s
Man could not &s;upport Life, for Nature is no
way able to &s;upport a View into Futurity; I mean
<PB N="43" REF="329">
not into that Part of Futurity which concerns us in
our State of Life in this World.</P>
<P>I have often been my&s;elf among the Number of
tho&s;e Fools, that would be their own Fortune-tel|lers;
but when I look thus beyond the Atmo&s;phere,
and &s;ee a little &s;peculatively into Invi&s;ibles, I could
ea&s;ily perceive, that it is our Happine&s;s that we
are &s;hort-&s;ighted Creatures, and can &s;ee but a very
little before us: <HI>For Example,</HI> were we to have the
Eyes of <HI>our Souls</HI> opened through the Eyes of <HI>our
Bodies,</HI> we &s;hould &s;ee this very immediate Region
of Air which we breath in, throng'd with Spirits,
to us, <HI>ble&s;&s;ed be God,</HI> now invi&s;ible, and which would
otherwi&s;e be mo&s;t frightful: We &s;hould &s;ee into
the &s;ecret Tran&s;actions of tho&s;e Me&s;&s;engers who
are employ'd when the pa&s;&s;ing Soul takes its Leave
of the Reluctant Body, and perhaps &s;ee Things Na|ture
would &s;hrink back from with the utmo&s;t Ter|ror
and Amazement. In a Word, the Curtain of Pro|vidence
for the Di&s;pofition of Things here, and
the Curtain of Judgment for the Determination of
the State of Souls hereafter, would be alike
drawn back, and what Heart could &s;upport here
its future State <HI>in LIFE,</HI> much le&s;s that of its
future State <HI>after LIFE</HI> even good or bad.</P>
<P>It is then our Felicity, that the Conver&s;e of Spi|rits,
and the Vi&s;ions of Futurity, are &s;ilent, em|blematick,
and done by Hints, Dreams, and Im|pul&s;es,
and not by clear Vi&s;ion and open Di&s;covery;
they that de&s;ire a fuller and plainer Sight of the&s;e
Things, ask they know not what; and it was a
good An&s;wer of a Gyp&s;y, when a Lady of my Ac|quaintance,
ask'd her, to tell her Fortune; <HI>Do not
ask me, Lady,</HI> &s;aid the Gyp&s;y, <HI>to tell you what you
dare not hear.</HI> The Woman was a little hone&s;ter than
her Profe&s;&s;ion intimated, and freely confe&s;s'd it was
all a Cheat, and that they knew nothing of Fortunes,
<PB N="44" REF="330">
but had a Cour&s;e or Round of doubtful Expre&s;&s;ions,
to amu&s;e ignorant People and get a little Money.</P>
<P>Even the Devils Oracles, for &s;uch no doubt
they were at <HI>Delphos,</HI> and at other Places, though
the Devil &s;eemed at that Time to have &s;ome Li|berties
granted him, which it is evident have &s;ince
been denied him, were allowed to be given only
in doubtful Expre&s;&s;ions, double Entendres, Ecchoes
of Words, and &s;uch like: <HI>For Example,</HI> A Man
going to Sea and enquiring of the Oracle, thus;
<Q><L>Have I ju&s;t cau&s;e the Seas and Storms to Fear?</L>
<L>Eccho.&mdash;<HI>Fear.</HI></L></Q>
Another.
<Q><L>Shall we the <HI>Parthian</HI> Bowmen fight or Fly?</L>
<L>Eccho.&mdash;<HI>Fly.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Such dark Replies, and other Words doubtful
and enigmatic, were frequently given and taken for
An&s;wers, by which the deluded World were kept in
doubt of that Futurity they hunted after: But Satan
even then, was not permitted to &s;peak plain, or
Mankind to &s;ee what awaited him behind the dark
Veil of Futurity, nor was it proper on any Ac|count
what&s;oever, that it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>But before I come to this, let me far from Li|mits
to the Elevations and Vi&s;ions I have men|tioned
before; for as I am far from Enthu&s;ia&s;tic
in my Notions of Things, &s;o I would not lead any
one to fancy them&s;elves farther enlightned than is
meet, or to &s;ee Things un&s;eeable, as St. <HI>Paul</HI> heard
Things unutterable.</P>
<P>And therefore let me add here, that the highe&s;t
Raptures, Trances and Elevations of the Soul, are
bounded by the eternal Decree of Heaven and let
<PB N="45" REF="331">
Men pretend to what Vi&s;ions they plea&s;e, it is all
Romance, all beyond what I have talked of a|bove,
is fabulous and ab&s;urd, and it will for ever
be true, as the Scripture &s;ays, not only, <HI>tho&s;e
Things are hid from the Eye,</HI> but even from the
Conception.</P>
<P>Upon this Occa&s;ion I mu&s;t own, that I think
'tis Criminal to attempt to form Ideas either of
Hell or of Heaven in the Mind, other than as the
Scripture has de&s;cribed them, by the State rather
than the Place; we are told in plain Words, <HI>it
hath not entred into the Heart of Man to conceive,</HI> ei|ther
of what is prepared for the future State of the
Happy or Mi&s;erable; 'tis enough for us to enter|tain
the general Notion, the Favour of God is
Heaven, and the Lo&s;s of it the mo&s;t dreadful of
all Hell.</P>
<Q><L>A <HI>HEAVEN</HI> of Joy mu&s;t in his Pre&s;ence dwell;</L>
<L>And in his Ab&s;ence every Place is <HI>HELL.</HI></L></Q>
<P>My Meaning is this, all Vi&s;ions, or propoun|ded
Vi&s;ions either of Heaven or Hell, are meet$
Delu&s;ions of the Mind, and generally are Fictions
of a waking bewildred Head; and you may &s;ee
the Folly of them in the meanne&s;t of the De&s;crip|tions,
which generally end in &s;hewing &s;ome glo|rious
Place, fine Walks, noble illu&s;trious Palaces,
Gardens of Gold, and People of &s;hining Forms,
and the like. Alas! the&s;e are all &s;o &s;hort, that
they are Unworthy the Thoughts of a Mind
elevated two Degrees above Darkne&s;s and Dirt:
All the&s;e Things amount to no more than <HI>Ma|bomet</HI>'s
Alchoran, and the glorious State of Things
repre&s;ented by him to his Believers. In &s;hort,
all this makes only a Heaven of Sen&s;e, but comes
&s;o infinitely &s;hort of what alone mu&s;t or can be
<PB N="46" REF="332">
a Heaven to an exalted glorified Spirit, that I
as much want Words to expre&s;s how contem|tible
the be&s;t of the&s;e De&s;criptions are as to a
true De&s;cription of Heaven, as I do to expre&s;s a
true Idea, or De&s;cription of Heaven my&s;elf.</P>
<P>And how &s;hould this be done? We can Form
no Idea of any Thing that we know not and have
not &s;een, but in the Form of &s;omething that we
have &s;een. How then can we form an Idea of
God or Heaven, in any Form but of &s;ome|thing
which we have &s;een or known? By what
Image in the Mind can we judge of Spirits? By
what Idea conceive of eternal Glory? Let us
cea&s;e to Imagin concerning it, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to
attain, 'tis criminal to attempt it.</P>
<P>Let me therefore hint here, that &s;uppo&s;ing my
&s;elf, as before, in the Orbit of the Sun, take it
in its immen&s;e Di&s;tance as our A&s;tronomers con|ceive
of it, or on the Edge only of the Atmo&s;|phere
with a clear View of the whole <HI>Solar Sy|&s;tem,</HI>
the Region of Satan's Empire all in View,
and the World of Spirits laid open to me.</P>
<P>Yet let me give you this for a Check to your
Imagination, that even here the Space between
Finite and Infinite is as impenetrable as on Earth,
and will for ever be &s;o, till our Spirits being un|ca&s;ed
&s;hall take their Flight to the Center of
Glory, where every Thing &s;hall be &s;een as it is;
and therefore you mu&s;t not be &s;urprized, if I am
come down again from the Verge of the World
of Spirits, the &s;ame &s;hort &s;ighted Wretch, as to Fu|turity
and Things belonging to Heaven and Hell
as I went up; for Elevations of this Kind are
meant only to give us a clearer View of what we
<HI>are,</HI> not of what we <HI>&s;hall be;</HI> and 'tis an Advan|tage
worth Travelling for too. All this I thought
nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the whim&s;ical Building of
<PB N="47" REF="333">
erroneous Structures on my Foundation, and fan|cying
them&s;elves carried farther than they are
able to go.</P>
<P>I come therefore back to talk of Things fa|miliar,
and particularly to mention in the next
Place, &s;ome of tho&s;e other Ways by which we
have Notice given of this Conver&s;e of Spirits
which I have been &s;peaking of; for the Whi&s;|pers
and In&s;inuators I have mentioned, go &s;ome|times
farther than ordinary.</P>
<P>One of tho&s;e other Methods is, when by
<HI>&s;trong Impul&s;es</HI> of the Mind, as we call them, we
are directed to do, or not to do, this or that
particular Thing that we have before us to do, or,
are under Con&s;ultation about. I am a Witne&s;s
to many of the&s;e Things, as well in my own Life,
as in my Ob&s;ervation of others.</P>
<P>I know a Man, who being at &s;ome Di&s;tance
from <HI>London,</HI> not above &s;ix or &s;even Miles, a
Friend that came to vi&s;it and dine with him urged
him to go to <HI>London.</HI> What for, &s;ays, his Friend,
is there any Bu&s;ine&s;s wants me? Nay, nothing,
&s;ays the other, but for your Company; I do not
know of any Thing wants you; and &s;o gave over
importuning him: But as his Friend had given
it over, a &s;trong Impul&s;e of Mind &s;eized him and
follow'd him like a Voice with this, <HI>Go to</HI> London,
<HI>go to</HI> London. He put it by &s;everal Times, but it
went on &s;till, Go to <HI>London,</HI> go to <HI>London,</HI> and
nothing el&s;e could come upon his Thoughts but,
<HI>Go to</HI> London. He came back to his Friend,
Hark ye, &s;ays he, tell me &s;incerely, is all well
at <HI>London?</HI> Am I wanted there? Did you ask me
to go to <HI>London</HI> with you on any particular Ac|count.
Not I, &s;ays his Friend, in the lea&s;t; I
&s;aw all your Family, and all is very well there;
not did they &s;ay, they had any particular Occa|&s;ion
<PB N="48" REF="334">
for you to return; I only ask it as I told
you, for the Sake of your Company: So he put
off going again, but could have no Quiet, for it
&s;till followed him, and no doubt, a good Spirit
communicated it, Go to <HI>London;</HI> and at length
he re&s;olved he would go, and did &s;o; and when
he came there he found a Letter and Me&s;&s;engers
had been at his Hou&s;e, to &s;eek him, and to tell
him of a particular Bu&s;ine&s;s, which was fir&s;t and
la&s;t worth above a thou&s;and Pounds to him, and
which if he had not been found that very Night,
would have been in Danger of being lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I &s;eriou&s;ly advi&s;e all &s;ober thinking Per&s;ons not
to di&s;regard tho&s;e powerful Impul&s;es of the Mind,
in Things otherwi&s;e indifferent or doubtful, but
believe them to be Whi&s;pers from &s;ome kind Spi|rit,
which &s;ees &s;omething that we cannot &s;ee,
and knows &s;omething that we cannot know.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, unle&s;s infinite Power &s;hould take off
the Silence that is impo&s;ed upon the Inhabitants
of the invi&s;ible World, and allow them to &s;peak
audibly, nothing can be a plainer Voice; they
are Words &s;poken to the Mind, tho' not to the
Ear, and they are a certain Intelligence of Things
un&s;een, becau&s;e they are given by Per&s;ons un|&s;een,
and the Event confirms it beyond all Di|&s;pute,</P>
<P>I know a Man, who made it his Rule always
to obey the&s;e &s;ilent Hints, and he has often de|clared
to me, that when he obeyed them he ne|ver
mi&s;carried, and if he neglected them, or went
on contrary to them, he never &s;ucceeded; and
gave me a particular Ca&s;e of his own, among
a great many others, wherein he was thus direct|ed.
He had a particular Ca&s;e befallen him,
wherein he was under the Di&s;plea&s;ure of the Go|vernment,
and was pro&s;ecuted for a Mi&s;demea|nor,
<PB N="49" REF="335">
and brought to a Tryal in the King's Bench
Court, where a Verdict was brought again&s;t him,
and he was ca&s;t; and Times running very hard
at that Time again&s;t the Party he was of, he
was afraid to &s;tand the Hazard of a Sentence
and ab&s;conded, taking Care to make due Provi|&s;ion
for his Bail, and to pay them whatever they
might &s;uffer. In this Circum&s;tance he was in
great Di&s;tre&s;s, and no Way pre&s;ented unto him
but to fly out of the Kingdom, which being to
leave his Family, Children and Employment, was
very bitter to him, and he knew not what to
do; all his Friends advi&s;ing him not to put him|&s;elf
into the Hands of the Law, which tho' the
Offence was not Capital, yet in his Circum|&s;tances
&s;eemed to threaten his utter Ruin. In
this Extremity he felt one Morning, (ju&s;t as he
had awaked, and the Thoughts of his Misfor|tune
began to return upon him;) I &s;ay, he felt a
&s;trong Impul&s;e darting into his Mind thus, <HI>Write
a Letter to them:</HI> It &s;poke &s;o di&s;tinctly to him,
and as it were forcibly, that as he has often &s;aid
&s;ince, he can &s;carce per&s;uade him&s;elf not to be|lieve
but that he heard it; but he grants that he
did not really hear it, too.</P>
<P>However it repeated the Words daily and
hourly to him, till at length walking about in
his Chamber where he was hidden, very pen|&s;ive
and &s;ad, it Jogg'd him again, and he an|&s;wered
aloud to it, as if it had been a Voice,
<HI>Who &s;hall I write to?</HI> It returned immediately,
<HI>Write to the Judge.</HI> This per&s;ued him again for
&s;everal Days, till at length he took his Pen, Ink
and Paper, and &s;at down to write, but knew not
one Word of what he &s;hould &s;ay, but <HI>Dabitur in hac
hora, he wanted not Words:</HI> It was immediately im|pre&s;&s;ed
on his Mind, and the Words flowed up|on
<PB N="50" REF="336">
his Pen in a manner, that even charm'd him|&s;elf,
and filled him with Expectations of Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>The Letter was &s;o &s;trenous in Argument, &s;o
pathetick in its Eloquence, and &s;o moving and
per&s;wa&s;ive, that as &s;oon as the Judge read it,
he &s;ent him Word he &s;hould be ea&s;ie, for he
would Endeavour to make that Matter light to
him, and in a Word never left, till be obtained
to &s;top Pro&s;ecution, and re&s;tore him to his Li|berty
and to his Family.</P>
<P>The&s;e Hints, I &s;ay, are of a Nature too &s;igni|ficant
to be neglected; whence they come is the
next Enquiry. I an&s;wer, They are the Whi&s;pers
of &s;ome &s;ub&s;i&s;ting Spirit communicated to the
Soul, without the Help of the Organ, without
the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a particular Sound, and with|out
any other Communication; but take it as you
go, not without the merciful Di&s;po&s;ition of that
Power, that governs that World, as well as this
that we are &s;en&s;ible of; How near tho&s;e Spirits
are to us, who thus for$ce what concerns us,
and how they convey the&s;e Hints into our Minds
as well waking as &s;leeping, or how they are di|rected,
that I could not di&s;cover, nor can yet re|&s;olve,
no not in the highe&s;t of my imaginary Ele|vation,
any more than in what Manner they are
Limited and re&s;trained.</P>
<P>I have been asked by &s;ome, to whom I have
talked freely of my frequent Applications to
the&s;e Things, If I knew any Thing by tho&s;e
Ob&s;ervations, of the Manner of the Di&s;po&s;ition of
human Soul after its Departure out of the Body?
I mean as to its middle State, and whether, as
&s;ome, it has a wandring Exi&s;tence in the upper
Part of the Wa&s;te or Aby&s;s near to, but not in
a pre&s;ent State of Felicity? Whether it is &s;till
confined within the Atmo&s;phere of the Earth
<PB N="51" REF="337">
according to others, as in a <HI>Limbus,</HI> or Purga|tory;
or in the Circle of the Sun, as others &s;ay?
Whether I knew or perceived any Thing of our
Saviour's being a&s;cended into the Body of the
Sun only, and not into the highe&s;t Heaven re|ceiving
his redeemed Souls to him&s;elf, and in|to
an Incorporation with his Glory there, <HI>till the
Re&s;titution of all Things?</HI> Whether I perceived any
Thing of Satan being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the reprobate
Souls as they departed; and of his Sub&s;titutes
as Executioners, being empowered and employ|ed
to torment them according to the receiv|ed
Notions of the wi&s;e Contemplators of &s;uch
Things.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, as I do now, that not only no|thing
of all this appears, but on the contrary, &s;uch
&s;erious Contemplations as mine give a great and a|bundant
Rea&s;on to be &s;atified, that there is no|thing
in it all but meer Dream and enthu&s;ia&s;tick
Conjecture: I own that the Agents I mention|ed,
make u&s;e of all tho&s;e Things to terrify and
affright poor ignorant People out of their Sen&s;es,
and to drive them often into De&s;peration, and
after to re&s;tore them by a Cure that is wor&s;e
than the Di&s;temper, namely, by a Hardne&s;s and
Coldne&s;s of Temper, rejecting entirely all the No|tions
of Eternity and Futurity, and &s;o fitting them
to go out of the World as they lived in it, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
without troubling them&s;elves with what is to
come after it.</P>
<P>But I return to the Article of Impul&s;es of the
Mind, for I lay greater Weight upon the&s;e than
upon any of the other Di&s;coveries of the In|vi&s;ible
World, becau&s;e they have &s;omething in
them relating to what we are about, &s;ome|thing
directing, &s;omething to guide us in avoid|ing
the evils that attend us, and to accepting, or
<PB N="52" REF="338">
rather embracing Opportunities of doing our|&s;elves
good when they pre&s;ent, which many
Times for want of the knowledge of our Way,
we irrecoverably let &s;lip.</P>
<P>Voices, Apparitions, Noi&s;es, and all the o|ther
affrighting Things, which unavoidably fol|low
the Neighbourhood of Spirits in the Air
we breath in, &s;eem to have much le&s;s Significa|tion,
<HI>as to us,</HI> than the&s;e &s;ea&s;onable kind Whi&s;|pers
to our Souls, which it is plain, are directed
for the Advantage of Life.</P>
<P>It &s;eems hard that Mankind &s;hould be &s;o open
to the &s;ecret In&s;inuators the whi&s;pering Devils I
have been &s;peaking of, who are Night and Day,
&s;leeping and waking, working upon his Sen&s;es by
the Arts and Subtilties of Hell, to fill his Ima|gination
with a thou&s;and devili&s;h Contrivances
to gratify his Vanity and Lu&s;t; and that our
Thoughts &s;hould be always ready to receive the
Impre&s;&s;ions they make, pre&s;&s;ed to follow the
infernal Coun&s;el, be awake to li&s;ten to all his
Directions, but &s;hould be deaf to the In&s;tructions
of any kind Spirits that would influence us for our
Advantage, and in&s;en&s;ible of tho&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions
which are made upon us for our immediate Good,
by an Agent Good in it&s;elf, and acting from a
Principle whatever it be, of Good to us.</P>
<P>We have a fooli&s;h Saying, though taken from
Something that is more &s;ignificant than we ima|gine
when any Danger has i$pri&s;ed us. Well,
<HI>my Mind mi&s;g$ve me,</HI> when I was going about it:
Well, I knew &s;ome Mi&s;chief would come of it;
<HI>did you &s;o?</HI> And why, than did you do it? Why
did you &s;o on? Why, when <HI>your Mind mi&s;gave
you,</HI> did you not obey the friendly Caution?
$word$ do you think your Mind received the
$word$ Impre&s;&s;ion? Why did you
<PB N="53" REF="339">
not li&s;ten to it, <HI>as to a Voice?</HI> For &s;uch a one it
was no doubt; and let all tho&s;e unthinking Peo|ple
who go on in any Thing they are upon, con|trary
to tho&s;e &s;ecret &s;ilent Impre&s;&s;ions upon their
Minds; I &s;ay, let them know and ob&s;erve it,
they will very &s;eldom fail of meeting &s;ome Mi&s;|chief
in the Way. They will very &s;eldom fail of
mi&s;carrying in the Way; <HI>I &s;ay very &s;eldom,</HI> be|cau&s;e
I would not take upon me to pre&s;cribe
Things po&s;itively, which the Reader will take
me up &s;hort in, and &s;ay, how do I know it? But
I will take the Liberty to &s;ay, I dur&s;t be po&s;i|tive
in it, relating to my &s;elf, and I dur&s;t be po|&s;itive
from the Nature and Rea&s;on of the Thing.</P>
<P>As to my own Experience, I wave &s;aying much
of it, but that in general I never &s;lighted the&s;e
Impul&s;es, but to my great Misfortune; I never
li&s;ten'd to and obey'd them, but to my great Ad|vantage,
but I choo&s;e to argue from the Rea&s;on
of them, rather than from my own Experience.</P>
<P>As they are evident Warnings of what is to
come, and are te&s;tified daily and hourly by the
Things coming to pa&s;s afterwards, &s;o they are
undeniable Te&s;timonies, that they proceed from
&s;ome Being, intelligent of tho&s;e Things that are
at Hand, while they are yet to come. If then
I am &s;atisfied that it is a Notice given from a
Something, <HI>be it what it will,</HI> which is fully in|form'd
of what is attending me, tho' conceal'd
from me; why &s;hould I &s;light the Hint given
me from any Thing that knows, what I know
not, and e&s;pecially, for Example, for avoiding
Evils to come.</P>
<P>I know a Per&s;on, who had &s;o &s;trong an Impre&s;&s;i|on
upon her Mind, that the Hou&s;e &s;he was in
would be burnt that very Night, that &s;he could
not go to &s;leep, the Impul&s;e &s;he had upon her
<PB N="54" REF="340">
Mind pre&s;s'd her not to go to Bed, which how|ever
&s;he re&s;i&s;ted and went to Bed, but was &s;o
terrified with the Thought, which as &s;he call'd
it, run in her Mind, that the Hou&s;e would be
burnt, that &s;he could not go to &s;leep.</P>
<P>She had made &s;o much Di&s;covery of her Ap|prehen&s;ions
in the Family, that they were all
in a Fright, and applied them&s;elves to &s;earch
from the Top of the Hou&s;e to the Bottom, and
to &s;ee every Fire, and every Candle &s;afe out, &s;o
that, as they all &s;aid, it was impo&s;&s;ible any
Thing could happen in the Hou&s;e, and they &s;ent
to the Neighbours on both Sides to do the like.
Thus far they did well, but had &s;he obeyed the
Hint, which pre&s;t upon her &s;trangely not to go
to Bed, &s;he had done much better, for the Fire
was actually kindled at that very Time, tho' not
broken out.</P>
<P>In about an Hour, after the whole Family was
in Bed, the Hou&s;e ju&s;t over the Way, directly
oppo&s;ite, was all in a Flame, and the Wind
which was very high, blowing the Flame upon
the Hou&s;e this Gentlewoman lived in, &s;o $word$ it
with Smoke and Fire in a few Moments, the
Street being Narrow, that they had not Air to
breath, or Time to do any Thing, but jump
out of their Beds and &s;ave their Lives; had &s;he
obey'd the Hint given, and not gone to Bed, &s;he
might have &s;aved &s;everal Things of Value,
which &s;he lo&s;t; but as &s;he neglected that, and
would go to Bed, the Moments &s;he had &s;par'd
to her, were but ju&s;t &s;ufficient to get out of Bed,
get &s;ome Cloaths on, and get down Stairs, for
the Hou&s;e was on Fire in half Quarter of an
Hour.</P>
<P>It might be ask'd here, why could not the
&s;ame kind Spirit have intimated by the &s;ame
<PB N="55" REF="341">
Whi&s;pers, where the Danger lay, and from what
Quarter it was to be expected; in what Man|ner
the Fire would attack them, and that it
would come from the other Side of the Street,
the Wind blowing it directly upon them?</P>
<P>To this, I an&s;wer, that it is our Bu&s;ine&s;s the
more vigilantly to ob&s;erve and li&s;ten to the Hints
which are given, &s;eeing the Intimations are not
&s;o Particular as we might wi&s;h, without enqui|ring
into the Rea&s;ons, why they are given no
plainer. We have a great deal of Rea&s;on to be|lieve
the kind Spirit that gives the&s;e Intimations
and Whi&s;pers, thus to us, gives us all the Light
it is permitted to give, and whi&s;pers as much,
either as it knows, or as it is allow'd to commu|nicate;
otherwi&s;e, why does it give any Inti|mations
at all? But on the other Hand, it may
be alledg'd, that enough is intimated to &s;uffice
for our Safety, if we will obey the Intimation;
and it would be a much more rea&s;onable Que|&s;tion,
to ask, why we &s;light and di&s;obey the im|pre&s;&s;ion
that we acknowledge to have received,
rather than why the Intimation was no plainer.</P>
<P>A Per&s;on of my Acquaintance being to go to
<HI>New-England</HI> by Sea, two Ships pre&s;ented, and
the Ma&s;ters earne&s;tly &s;olicited to take him as a
Pa&s;&s;enger; he asked my Advice, profe&s;&s;ing, that
as well the Ships, as the Captains, were perfect|ly
indifferent to him, both the Men being equally
agreeable to him, and the Ve&s;&s;els equally good.
I had my Eye upon this Notion of Impul&s;es, and
pre&s;t him to ob&s;erve &s;trictly, if he had not &s;ome
&s;ecret Motion of his Mind to one Ship rather
than another, and he &s;aid he had not.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Time he accidentally met one of
the Captains, and falling into Terms with him,
agreed for his Pa&s;&s;age, and accordingly prepar'd
<PB N="56" REF="342">
to go on board; but from the very Time that
he made the Agreement, nay, even while he was
making the Bargain, he had a &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ion
on his Mind, that he &s;hould not go in that
Ship.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome Days after this, that he told me
of the&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions, which increas'd on him e|very
Day; upon which I pre&s;t him earne&s;tly not
to go, but to take Pa&s;&s;age with the other. Af|ter
he had re&s;olv'd upon this, the came to me,
and told me, that he had with &s;ome Difficulty,
and &s;ome Lo&s;s, put off the fir&s;t Ship, but that
now he had the &s;ame, or rather &s;tronger Aver&s;i|on
to going in the &s;econd Ship, and had a &s;trong
Impre&s;&s;ion on his Mind, that if he went in the
&s;econd Ship he &s;hould be drowned; I bid him
con&s;ider it a little, and tell me if he had any
farther Intimations of it; and he continued to
tell me, that he had no Re&s;t about his going in
either of tho&s;e Ships, and yet his Affairs lay &s;o,
that he was under a Nece&s;&s;ity of going, and
there was no other Ship put up upon the <HI>Ex|change</HI>
for going.</P>
<P>I pre&s;s'd him, however, not to venture by any
Means; I convinc'd him, that tho&s;e Impul&s;es of
his Mind were the Whi&s;pers of &s;ome kind Spi|rit,
that &s;aw Things farther than he could, and
were certainly given him as Cautions to &s;ave
him from &s;ome Mi&s;chief which the might not
fore&s;ee; that it could be no evil Spirit, becau&s;e
the keeping him back could be no Injury to
him, of &s;uch a Nature as would gratify the De|vil
in any Part of his u&s;ual De&s;ires; it mu&s;t there|fore
be &s;omething for his Good, and he ought
to be very cautious how he &s;lighted the &s;ilent Ad|monition.
In a Word, I prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd him &s;o much
in aid of the &s;ecret Impul&s;es of his own Mind,
<PB N="57" REF="343">
that he re&s;olved not to go that Year, and he
&s;aw clearly afterwards, that the &s;ecret Intimati|mation
was from a good Hand, for both the
Ships mi&s;carried; the fir&s;t being taken by the
<HI>Turks,</HI> and the latter ca&s;t away and all the Men
lo&s;t, the Ship foundring at Sea, as was &s;uppos'd,
for &s;he was never heard of.</P>
<P>I could fill this Tract with Accounts of this
Nature, but the Rea&s;on of the Ca&s;e is &s;tronger
than the Example; for as it is an Intimation of
&s;omething future, and that is to come to pa&s;s, it is
certain, there is a State in which what is Future
and mu&s;t come to pa&s;s is known, and why &s;hould
we not believe the News, if it comes from the
Place where the Certainty of it is known?</P>
<P>Some give all this to a Pre&s;cience peculiar to
the Soul it &s;elf, and of kin to that we call the
<HI>Second Sight;</HI> but I &s;ee no Ground for this, but
mere Pre&s;umption. Others call it an <HI>Afflatus,</HI>
which they think is a Di&s;temper of the Brain.
Others call it a <HI>Sympathetick Power in the Soul,</HI>
foreboding its own Di&s;a&s;ters. But all this is
&s;hort of the Thing, for here is not a Foreboding
only, which indeed is often felt, but is expre&s;s'd
another Way; but here is a direct Intelligence; a
plain Intimation of the Evil, and warning to a|void
it: This mu&s;t be more than an <HI>Afflatus,</HI> more
than a <HI>Sympathy;</HI> this mu&s;t be from a certain
Knowledge of a Thing that <HI>exi&s;ts not,</HI> by a Some|thing
that <HI>does exi&s;t;</HI> and mu&s;t be communicated
by a Conver&s;e of Spirits unembodied, with the
Spirit embodied, for its Good; unle&s;s you will
call it <HI>Divine Revelation,</HI> which I &s;ee no Ground
for.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Rea&s;onings make it abundantly our
Concern to regard the&s;e Things, as what we are
greatly concern'd in; However that is not the chief
<PB N="58" REF="344">
U&s;e I make of them here, but (1.) they abundantly
explain the Nature of the World of Spirits, and
the Certainty of an Exi&s;tence after Death; (2.)
they confirm that the Di&s;po&s;ition of Providence
concerning Man, and the Event of Things, are
not &s;o much hidden from the Inhabitants of that
World as they are from us; as al&s;o (3.) that Spirits
unembodied &s;ee with a Sight differing from us,
and are capable of knowing what attends us,
when we know nothing of it our &s;elves.</P>
<P>This offer'd many u&s;eful Reflections to my
Mind, which, however, 'ti$ impo&s;&s;ible for me to
communicate with the &s;ame Vivacity, or to ex|pre&s;s
with the &s;ame Life, that the Impre&s;&s;ion
they make on my own Thoughts came with.</P>
<P>1. The Knowledge of there being a World of
Spirits, may be many Ways u&s;eful to us, and e&s;pecially
that of their &s;eeing into Futurity, &s;o as to
be able to communicate to us, by what Means &s;o|ever
they do it, what we &s;hall, or &s;hall not do,
or what &s;hall, or &s;hall not befall us; to communi|cate
Dangers before us, &s;o as they may be avoided,
and Mi&s;chiefs awaiting us, &s;o as they may be pre|vented,
and even Death it &s;elf, &s;o as we may pre|pare
for it; For we may certainly, if we would at|tend
to the&s;e Things, encrea&s;e our Acquaintance
with them, and that very much to our Advantage.</P>
<P>I would be far from prompting the crazy Imagina|tions
of Hypocondriac Di&s;temper'd Heads, which
run Men out to &s;o many Extravagancies, and which
in fixing their Thoughts upon the real World
of Spirits, make <HI>this</HI> an imaginary World of Spi|rits
to them; who think they are talk'd to from
the invi&s;ible World, by the Howling of every Dog,
or the Screeching of every Owl. I believe it was
much of this vapouri&s;h dreaming Fancy, by which
the <HI>Augurs</HI> of the <HI>Romans</HI> determin'd Events from the
<PB N="59" REF="345">
Flying of Birds, and the Entrails of Bea&s;ts. It will
be hard for me to be prevail'd on to &s;uppo&s;e,
that even tho&s;e intelligent Spirits which I &s;peak of,
who are able by &s;uch ea&s;y Ways, as the Impul|&s;es
of our Minds, Dreams, and the like, to con|vey
the Knowledge of Things to us, can be put
to the Nece&s;&s;ity, or find Rea&s;on to make U&s;e of
the Agency of Dogs and Birds, to convey their
Notices by; this would be to &s;uppo&s;e them to
be much more confin'd in their Conver&s;e with us,
than we evidently find they are; and on the other
Hand would &s;uppo&s;e the inanimate World to have
more Knowledge of the invi&s;ible, than we have,
whereas on the other Hand we know they have no|thing
at all to do with it.</P>
<P>There is only this to be &s;aid for it, namely,
that tho&s;e inanimate Creatures do it involunta|rily,
and as it were, under the Power of a Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I will not affirm, but that the invi&s;ible Inhabi|tants
I have been &s;peaking of, may have Power to
act upon the brute Creatures, &s;o as to employ
them, or make u&s;e of their Agency in the Warn|ings
and Notices which they give to us of Things
to come; but that the Brutes have otherwi&s;e a|ny
farther Sight of Things than we have, I can
&s;ee nothing at all of that. It is true, <HI>Balaam</HI>'s
A&s;s &s;aw the Angel with the flaming Sword, &s;tan|ding
in the Road, when the Prophet did not,
but the Rea&s;on is plainly expre&s;s'd; the Angel
was really there, and actually pre&s;enting Terror
to them with a flaming Sword in his Hand, on|ly
the Prophets Eyes were miraculou&s;ly witheld,
that he could not &s;ee him.</P>
<P>I &s;hall unriddle this My&s;tery of the Agency of
Bea&s;ts, and Birds, as far as Rea&s;on dictates;
and it &s;eems to be Ea&s;y upon the Scheme of the
<PB N="60" REF="346">
Nearne&s;s of the Spirits I am &s;peaking of to us,
and their Concern to convey Intelligence to us:
They may, I &s;ay, have Power to Terrify the
Brutes by horrible Apparitions to them, &s;o as to
force tho&s;e Howlings and Screichings we have
been told of, and to do this in &s;uch Places, and
at &s;uch Times as &s;hall &s;uit with the Circum&s;tances
of the Family or Per&s;on concern'd, and &s;o far
their &s;aid extraordinary Howlings and Screichings
may be &s;ignificant; but that the Brutes can ei|ther
by Sen&s;e, or by extraordinary Sight have any
Foreknowledge of Things in Futurity relating to
us, or to them&s;elves; this has no Foundation in
Rea&s;on or Philo&s;ophy any more than it has in Re|ligion.
Matter may act upon material Objects,
and &s;o the Under&s;tanding or Sen&s;e of a Brute
may act upon vi&s;ible Objects, but Matter cannot
act upon immaterial Things, and &s;o the Eye of a
Bea&s;t cannot &s;ee a Spirit, or the Mind of a Brute
act upon Futurity, Eternity, and the &s;ublime
Things of a State to come.</P>
<P>What U&s;e then the Spirits we &s;peak of, inhabi|ting
the invi&s;ible World, can make of the inani|mate
World to direct them, as Mi&s;&s;ionaries to us,
I do not &s;ee, neither did I in all my Altitudes
perceive they employ'd any &s;uch Agents.</P>
<P>It is from the Mi&s;under&s;tanding of the&s;e Things
that we place abundance of Incidents meerly for|tuitous
to the Devils Account, which he knows
nothing of; many a Storm blows that is none
of his rai&s;ing; many a Mid-night Noi&s;e hap|pens
that is none of his making; if Satan or his
In&s;truments had one Tenth Part of the Pow|er,
either of the Air, or in the Air, or over the
Elements, that we give them in our Imginations,
we &s;hould have our Hou&s;es burnt every Night,
Hurricanes rai&s;ed in the Air, Floods made in the
<PB N="61" REF="347">
Country, and in a Word, the World would not
be habitable: But you remember I told you, as
powerful as he is, he is chain'd, he has a great
Clog at his Foot, and he can do nothing by Vio|lence,
or without Permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I might hint here at abundance of idle ridicu|lous
Devils, that we are daily told of, that come
and only make Game among us, put out our Can|dles,
throw Chairs and Stools about the Hou&s;e,
break Gla&s;&s;es, make a Smoak, a Stink of Brim|&s;tone,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereas after all, the Devil has no
more Sulphur about him than other Folks, and I
can an&s;wer for it, that Satan is not di&s;po&s;ed for
Mirth; all the Frolicks and Gambols we a&s;cribe
to him, I dare &s;ay, are Anticks of our own Brain.</P>
<P>I heard of a Hou&s;e in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> which they told me
was haunted, and that every Night the Devil or
a Spirit, call it which you will, came into &s;uch a
Room, and made a mo&s;t terrible Knocking, as if
it had a Hammer or a Mallet, and this for two
or three Hours together: At length, upon looking
about in an empty Clo&s;et in that Room, there
was found an old Mallet, and this was pre&s;ently
concluded to be the Mallet which the Devil made
&s;uch a Noi&s;e with, &s;o it was taken away: But
the next Night they &s;aid, the Devil made &s;uch a
Racket for want of the Mallet, that they were
much more di&s;turb'd than before, &s;o they were ob|liged
to leave the Mallet there again, and every
Night the Devil would come and knock in the
Window, for two or three Hours together with
that Mallet. I have &s;een the Room, and the
Mallet, in neither of which was any Thing ex|traordinary,
but never heard the Noi&s;e, though
I &s;at up to wait for it; nor after cau&s;ing the Mal|let
to be taken away, was there any Noi&s;e; be|like
<PB N="62" REF="348">
the mannerly Spirit would not di&s;turb us who
were Strangers.</P>
<P>This pa&s;s'd for a mo&s;t eminent Piece of Walk|ing
or Haunting, and all the Difficulty was to
enquire, to what Purpo&s;e all this Di&s;turbance was
made, &s;eeing there was no End an&s;wered in it,
and I always thought the Devil was too full of
Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;pend his Time to no manner of Pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, all the Cheat was di&s;covered, <HI>viz.</HI> that
a Monkey kept in a Hou&s;e three or four Hou&s;es
from it, had found the Way into that Room,
and came every Night almo&s;t about Midnight,
and diverted him&s;elf with the Frolick, and then
went Home again.</P>
<P>If the&s;e Things were not frequently detected,
it would be a great Scandal upon the Devil, that
he had nothing to employ him&s;elf in, more &s;igni|ficant,
than Rapping all Night with a Hammer
to fright and di&s;turb the Neighbours, making
Noi&s;es, putting out Candles, and the like: When
we come into the invi&s;ible State, of which we
now know &s;o little, we &s;hall be ea&s;ily convinced,
that the Devil is otherwi&s;e employ'd, and has Bu|&s;ine&s;s
of much more Importance upon his Hands.</P>
<P>It would be very in&s;ignificant, to have us &s;o fre|quently
warned again&s;t Satans Devices, to have us
be caution'd to be &s;ober and vigilant, knowing that
our Adver&s;ary the Devil, goes about like a roar|ing
Lion, &s;eeking, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All the&s;e Things import,
that he is diligent in attacking us, watching all
Advantages, hunting us down, circumventing,
waiting, and con&s;tantly plying us with Snares that
he may trapan and devour us: This admits not
any of tho&s;e &s;imple, ludicrous, and &s;en&s;ele&s;s Di|gre&s;&s;ions,
which we &s;et him to work upon in our
Imaginations.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="349">
Perhaps, it may be expected I &s;hould enter here
upon the Subject of Apparitions, and di&s;cour&s;e
with equal Certainty of that yet undecided Que|&s;tion,
concerning the Reality of Apparitions,
and whether departed Souls can revi&s;it the Place
of their former Exi&s;tence, take up Shapes, Bodies,
and vi&s;ible and apparent Beings, a&s;&s;ume Voices, and
concern them&s;elves with the Affairs of Life, of
Families, Per&s;ons, and even of E&s;tates, and the
like, as many have affirmed they have been Wit|ne&s;&s;es
to.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t be allowed to leave this where I find it;
there are &s;ome Difficulties which I am not yet got
over in it, nor have I been elevated high enough
to determine that Point, and &s;hall not venture to
decide it, without more certainty than I am yet
arriv'd to.</P>
<P>I would warn all People not to &s;uffer their Ima|gination,
to form Shapes and Appearances where
there are none; and I may take upon me to &s;ay,
that the Devil him&s;elf does not appear half &s;o of|ten,
as &s;ome People think they &s;ee him; Fancy go|verns
many People, and a &s;ick Brain forms &s;trange
Things to it&s;elf: But it does not follow from
thence that nothing can appear, becau&s;e nothing
does at that Time.</P>
<P>However, as my De&s;ign is to in&s;truct, not a|mu&s;e,
&s;o I &s;ay, I forbear to enter upon a Subject,
which I mu&s;t leave as doubtful as I find it, and
con&s;equently talk of to no Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I have heard of a Man that would allow the
Reality of Apparitions, but would have it be no|thing
but the Devil, that the Souls of Men de|parted
or good Spirits never appeared, it happen'd
that to this very Man &s;omething appear'd, as he &s;aid,
and in&s;i&s;ted upon it to the la&s;t: He &s;aid he &s;aw
the Shape of an ancient Man pa&s;s by him in the
<PB N="64" REF="350">
Dusk of the Evening, who holding up his Hand,
as it were in a threatning Po&s;ture, &s;aid aloud, <HI>O
wicked Creature, repent, repent.</HI> He was exceedingly
terrified, and con&s;ulted &s;everal People about it,
who all advi&s;ed him &s;eriou&s;ly to take the Advice;
for his Life made it well known it &s;eems, that he
&s;tood in need of it: But being &s;eriou&s;ly debating
about it, one of his Friends asked what he thought
of the Apparition, and whether it was any of the
Devils Bu&s;ine&s;s to bid him <HI>Repent;</HI> this puzzled
his Thoughts, and in a Word, he grew a very &s;o|ber
Man: But after all, it was a real Man, and no
Apparition that &s;poke to him, though his frighted
Fancy made him affirm that he vani&s;h'd out of his
Sight, which he did not. And the Per&s;on who
did it, being a Grave and pious Gentleman, met
him by mere Accident without any De&s;ign, and
&s;poke as he did, from the Knowledge he had of his
being indeed a mo&s;t wretched wicked Fellow: By
the Way, the Gentleman had the Opportunity to
hear the U&s;e that was made of it, and to hear
him&s;elf mi&s;taken for an Apparition of the Devil,
but he was &s;o prudent as not to di&s;cover it to the
Man, le&s;t the Reformation, which was the Con|&s;equence
of the Fright, &s;hould wear off, when he
&s;hould know, that there was nothing in the Thing
but what was common.</P>
<P>If we would always make the like good U&s;e of
<HI>Satan</HI>'s real Appearances, I do not know but it
would go a great Way to bani&s;h him from the vi|&s;ible
World; for I am well a&s;&s;ur'd he would very
&s;eldom vi&s;it us, if he thought his Com$ng would
do us any Good; at lea&s;t he would never come,
but when he was &s;ent, he would never come wil|lingly:
For he is &s;o ab&s;olutely at the Divine Di&s;|po&s;al,
that if Heaven Commands, he mu&s;t go,
though it were to do the good he abhors; not
<PB N="63" REF="351">
that I believe Heaven ever thinks fit to employ him
in doing Good, if ever he is let loo&s;e, 'tis to act in
Judgment as an In&s;trument of Vengeance, and
&s;ome are of Opinion, he is often employed as
a de&s;troying Angel, tho' I do not grant that; I can
hardly think the Ju&s;tice of God would gratify
Satan's Gu&s;t of doing Evil, &s;o far as to &s;uffer him
to be even &s;o much as an Executioner: But that is
by the Way.</P>
<P>I have another Turn to give this Part of my
Ob&s;ervations, which tho' perhaps &s;ome may not
think &s;o much to the Purpo&s;e, as entring into
a critical Enquiry after the Devils particular
Mi&s;&s;ion in the&s;e Ca&s;es: Yet I think otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erv'd, that &s;ome de&s;perate People
make a very ill u&s;e of the general Notion, that there
are no Apparitions, nor Spirits at all; and really
the U&s;e they make of it, is wor&s;e than the ex|treme
of tho&s;e, who, as I &s;aid, make Vi&s;ions
and Devils of every Thing they &s;ee or hear:
For the&s;e Men per&s;uade them&s;elves there are no
Spirits at all, either in the vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible
World, and carrying it on farther, they next an|nihilate
the Devil, and believe nothing about
him, either of one kind or another.</P>
<P>This would not be of &s;o much bad Con&s;equence,
if it was not always followed by a wor&s;e; namely,
that when they have prevailed with them&s;elves to
believe there is no Devil, the next Thing is, and
they &s;oon come to it, <HI>That there is no God,</HI> and &s;o
Athei&s;m takes its ri&s;e in the &s;ame Sink, with a
Carele&s;ne&s;s about Futurity.</P>
<P>I have no Mind to enter upon an Argument to
prove the being of our Maker, and to illu&s;trate
his Power by Words, who has &s;o many undeniable
Te&s;timonies in the Brea&s;ts of every rational Being

<PB N="64" REF="352">
this Work with a &s;hort Hi&s;tory of &s;ome A|thei&s;ts,
which I met with many Years ago,
and whether the Facts are te&s;tified or not, may
be equally u&s;eful in the Application, if you do
not think them a little too Religious for you.</P>
<P>Some Years ago, there was a young Gentleman,
a Scholar at the Univer&s;ity, eminent for Learn|ing
and Vertue, of prompt Parts, and great Pro|ficiency,
in&s;omuch that he was taken great No|tice
of by the Ma&s;ters and Fellows, and every
one promi&s;ed fair in their Thoughts for him, that
he would be a great Man. It happened, whe|ther
from his earne&s;t De&s;ire of more Knowledge,
or the Opinion of his own great Capacity, I know
not which; that this Gentleman falling upon the
Study of Divinity, grew &s;o opinionative, &s;o very
po&s;itive and dogmatic in his Notions in religious
Things, that by Degrees it came to this Height,
that his Tutor &s;aw plainly, he had little more than
Notions in all his religious Pretences to Know|ledge,
and concluded, he would either grow
Enthu&s;ia&s;tic or ob&s;tinately Profane and Athei|&s;tick.</P>
<P>He had three <HI>Chums</HI> or Companions in his Stu|dies,
and they all fell into the &s;ame Error, as well
by the Con&s;equence of a great deal of Wit and
little Grace, as by the Example and Leading of
this other young Gentleman, who was indeed
their Oracle, almo&s;t in every Thing.</P>
<P>As his Tutor who was a very good Man, fear'd
for him, &s;o it came to pa&s;s with him, and all the
re&s;t; for they ran up their &s;uperficial Notions in
Divinity to &s;uch a Height, that in&s;tead of Rea|&s;oning
them&s;elves into good Principles of Reli|gion,
they really rea&s;on'd them&s;elves out of all
Religion what&s;oever; running on to expunge
every right Idea from their Minds, pretending tho&s;e
<PB N="65" REF="353">
Things really <HI>were not,</HI> of which they could not
define both how and what <HI>they were;</HI> they pro|ceeded
to deny the Exi&s;tence of their Maker, the
Certainty of a future State, a Re&s;urrection, a Judg|ment,
a Heaven, or a Hell.</P>
<P>They were not contented to &s;atisfie them&s;elves
with the&s;e impious Foundations, but they &s;et up
to di&s;pute in private Societies again&s;t all revealed
Religion; there by bringing on them&s;elves the Cur&s;e
denounced in Scripture again&s;t tho&s;e, that do Evil
and <HI>teach Men &s;o to do;</HI> in a little Time they grew
&s;o publick, that more Company came in, and
which was wor&s;e, many joined with them in
Principle, or as I &s;hould rather have &s;aid, in ca&s;t|ing
off all Principles, and they began to be famous
in the Place, <HI>though to the Offence of all good Men,</HI>
and were call'd, <HI>The Athei&s;tical Club.</HI></P>
<P>They &s;oon began to &s;ee &s;ober, religious People &s;hun
them, and in &s;ome Time, upon Information given,
they were obliged by Authority, to &s;eparate for
Fear of Puni&s;hment, &s;o that they could not hold
their publick Di&s;putations, as they began to do;
yet they abated nothing of their wicked Cu&s;tom;
and this dreadful Creature, who &s;et up at the
Head of the re&s;t, began to be &s;o open in his
Bla&s;phemies, that he was at Length oblig'd to fly
from the Univer&s;ity.</P>
<P>However, he went a great while before it came
to that; and though he had been often admoni&s;h|ed,
yet in&s;tead of reclaiming, he grew the more
impious, making the mo&s;t Sacred Things his
Je&s;t, and the Subject of his Ridicule: He gave
out, That he could frame a new Go&s;pel, and a
much better <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of Religion, than that which
they call'd <HI>Chri&s;tian;</HI> and that if he would trouble
him&s;elf to go about it, he would not fail to draw
in as great a Part of the World to run after him,
<PB N="66" REF="354">
as had been after <HI>any other.</HI> I care not to repeat
any of his bla&s;phemous Words, it is not to be
&s;uppo&s;ed there can be any bla&s;phemous abominable
Thing, that this Set of wicked wretched young
Men did not run into, neither any Wicked|ne&s;s
of that kind within their Reach, which they
did not commit.</P>
<P>It would be too long to enter into the particu|lar
Hi&s;tory of the&s;e Men, and how it plea&s;ed
God to di&s;po&s;e of them; they might be in Number
before they &s;eparated about twenty-two in all, I
&s;hall tell you of &s;ome of them however, who did
not run &s;uch Lengths as the re&s;t: There was a
young Man, who frequented their Society, though
<HI>as he afterwards &s;aid,</HI> he was rather per&s;uaded to
be <HI>among them,</HI> than to be <HI>one of them;</HI> he had
however too much yielded to their Delu&s;ions;
and though they made him very much their Je&s;t,
becau&s;e they found he &s;till retained &s;ome little Sen&s;e
of a God, and of a future State in his Mind, yet
he had yielded dreadfully to them, and began to do
&s;o more and more every Day.</P>
<P>It happen'd one Day, this young Man was going
to their helli&s;h Society, and not minding the Wea|ther,
the Clouds gathered over his Head, and he
was &s;topp'd by a &s;udden Shower of Rain in the
Street: It rained &s;o very hard, that it obliged him
to &s;tand up in the Gate-way of an Inn for &s;ome
Time; while he was &s;tanding here, a great Fla&s;h
of Lightning more than ordinarily &s;urpriz'd him;
it &s;eems the Fire coming &s;o directly in his Face,
that he felt the very Warmth of it, and was ex|ceedingly
&s;tartled; in the &s;ame Moment almo&s;t,
<HI>as is natural in the Ca&s;e,</HI> followed &s;uch a Clap of
Thunder that perfectly a&s;toni&s;hed him. The Rain
continuing, kept him in the Gate-way, as I &s;aid, for a
good While, till he had Time for &s;uch Reflections,
<PB N="67" REF="355">
as the&s;e, <HI>Where am I going! What am I going about!
Who is it has &s;topt me thus! Why are the&s;e Thunders,
the&s;e Rains, and this Lightning thus Terrible? and whence
are they!</HI> and with the re&s;t came in this Thought,
warm and &s;wift as the Lightning, which had terri|fied
him before, <HI>What if there &s;hould be a God! What
will become of me then!</HI> Terrified with the&s;e Things,
he &s;tarts out of the <HI>Gate-way</HI> into the Street not|with&s;tanding
the Wet, and runs back through the
Rain, &s;aying to him&s;elf as he went, <HI>I will go among
them no more!</HI> When he came Home to his Cham|bers,
he fell into dreadful Agonies of Mind, and at
length broke out thus: <HI>What have I been doing! have I
been denying the Power that made me! De&s;pi&s;ing that
God who&s;e Five fla&s;h'd ju&s;t now in my Face! And
which, had not that Mercy I have abu&s;ed interpo&s;ed,
might have burnt me to Death! What kind of Creature
am I!</HI> While he was thus giving vent to his Re|flections,
a near Relation of his, a pious good
Man, who had often u&s;ed to &s;peak very plain|ly
to him of the horrid Sin he was guilty of, hap|pened
to come to vi&s;it him.</P>
<P>The young Man had thrown him&s;elf upon his
Bed, and had with the deepe&s;t Sen&s;e of his Mad|ne&s;s,
and mo&s;t &s;erious Reproaches of him&s;elf for
his horrid Life, been expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his
Friend, and he had been comforting him in the
be&s;t Manner he could, when after a while he de&s;ir'd
his Friend to retire, that he might be a little alone,
and might give vent to his Thoughts with the
more Freedom, and his Friend, taking a Book in
his Hand, &s;taid in the outer Room.</P>
<P>In this Interval came another Scholar to the
Door, who was one of the wicked Company I
mention'd ju&s;t now: He came not to vi&s;it this
fir&s;t Gentleman, but to call him to go with him to
the u&s;ual Meeting of their dreadful Society. And
<PB N="68" REF="356">
knocking at his Chamber Door; this Gentleman,
who was left in the Chamber, &s;tept to the Door,
and looking through a little Grate, not only knew
the Per&s;on, but knew him to be one of the wicked
Company I have been &s;peaking of: Now as he
was very loath, his Friend &s;hould have &s;uch an In|terruption
to the good Di&s;po&s;ition he was then in,
&s;o above all, he was loth he &s;hould be per&s;uaded
to go any more among that mi&s;erable Gang;
wherefore he opened the Door a little Way, &s;o
as he was not very di&s;tinctly &s;een, and &s;peaks aloud
in the Per&s;on of his Friend thus: O SIR, <HI>Be&s;eech
them all to repent;</HI> for depend upon it, <HI>There is a</HI>
GOD, tell them, <HI>I &s;ay &s;o;</HI> and with that he &s;hut
the Door upon him violently, giving him no Time
to reply, and going back into his Friends Room,
took no Notice of any Body having been at the
Door at all.</P>
<P>The Per&s;on who knocked at the Door, you may
&s;uppo&s;e, was one of the Leaders of the Company,
a young Scholar of good Parts and Sen&s;e, but de|bauch'd
by that horr$d Crew; and one that
had made him&s;elf eminent, for his declar'd Oppo|&s;ition
to all the common Notions of Religion; a
complete Athei&s;t and publickly &s;o, without God
or the De&s;ire of God in the World: However,
(<HI>as he afterwards confe&s;&s;ed</HI>) the Repul&s;e he met with
at the Door, <HI>and which he thought came from his
Friend,</HI> gave him a &s;trange Shock at fir&s;t, and fill'd
him with Horror: He went down the College-Stairs
in the greate&s;t Confu&s;ion imaginable, and
went mu&s;ing along a good Way, not knowing
where he was, or whither he went, and in that
Embarra&s;&s;ment of Thought went a whole Street
out of the Way; the Words had made an unu&s;ual
Impre&s;&s;ion upon his Mind, but he had his other
Surpri&s;es too; for he Thought his Friend, <HI>for he
<PB N="69" REF="357">
believ'd firmly, that it was he that had &s;poken to him,</HI>
had treated him very rudely.</P>
<P>Sometimes he re&s;ented it, and reflected upon it
as an Affront, and once or twice was upon the
Point of going back again to him, to know the
Rea&s;on of his u&s;ing him &s;o, and to demand Sati&s;|faction:
But &s;till the Words, THERE IS A GOD,
dwelt upon his Mind, <HI>and what if it &s;hould be &s;o?</HI>
&s;ays he, <HI>what then?</HI> Upon this Que&s;tion to him|&s;elf,
the An&s;wer immediately occurr'd to his Mind,
<HI>what then! why, then I am undone;</HI> for, <HI>have not
I declar'd War again&s;t the very Notion, defy'd all the
Pretenders to it, as mere Enthu&s;ia&s;$s and Men of
Whim&s;y?</HI> However, after the&s;e Thoughts his
Mind cool'd a little again, and it offered to him,
<HI>no doubt injected by an Evil Spirit,</HI> that he &s;hould not
trouble him&s;elf with enquiring into it one Way or
another, but <HI>be ea&s;y.</HI></P>
<P>This pacified him for a little While, and he
&s;hook off the Surpri&s;e he was in; the hardned
Temper &s;eem'd to return, and he kept on his Way
towards the helli&s;h Society, that he was going to
before: But &s;till the Words returned upon him,
THERE IS A GOD, and began to bring
&s;ome Terror with it upon his Mind; and the
la&s;t Words of his Friend came into his Mind often,
<HI>tell them, I &s;ay &s;o,</HI> this fill'd him with a Curio&s;ity
which he could not with&s;tand; <HI>viz.</HI> of going back
to his Friend, and enquiring of him, what Di&s;co|veries
he had made of this Kind? how he came to
have changed his Mind of &s;uddenly? and e&s;pecially,
how he was arrived to a Certainty of the Thing?</P>
<P>I told you, that there had been a great Shower
of Rain, which had &s;topp'd the fir&s;t young Gen|tleman
in his Way out; it &s;eems the Day was &s;till
&s;howery and a little Rain happening to fall again,
as this Gentleman went by a Book&s;eller's Shop,</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="358">
he &s;tops at the Door to &s;tand up a little out of
the wet.</P>
<P>There happens to be &s;itting in the Shop reading
a Book, a Gentleman of his Acquaintance, though
far differing from him in his Principles, being a
very &s;ober, &s;tudious, religious young Man, a Stu|dent
in Divinity of the &s;ame College, who look|ing
up called him in, and after a few common Sa|lutes,
he whi&s;pers in his Ear.</P>

<Q>Here he repeats the Pa&s;&s;age a$ large,
and his own Thoughts, and Re&s;ent|ment
as before.</Q>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend upon it, 'twas &s;ome Voice from
Heaven, it was nothing of mine; I have not been
at the Door &s;ince two of the Clock, when I came
fir&s;t in, but have been on the Bed or in my Study
ever &s;ince, wholly taken up with my own Thoughts,
and very much indi&s;pos'd.</P>
</SP>
<Q>The young Man turns Pale, and falls
into a Swound.</Q>
<P>There was a great deal more belonging to this
Story, but 'tis too long for the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, I
have related this Part on &s;everal Accounts, and it
hits the Purpo&s;e I am upon many Ways.</P>
<P>1. Here is a vi&s;ible Evidence of God, and of
his Being and Nature fix'd &s;o in the Mind,
that not the mo&s;t hardn'd Athei&s;t can deny it,
Nature recoils at every Endeavour to &s;up|pre&s;s
it, and the very Pul&s;ation of his Blood
&s;hall di&s;cover and acknowledge it.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="371">
2. Yet even in this, we &s;ee how the Power of
Imagination may be work'd up, by the &s;e|cret
Agency of an unknown Hand, how ma|ny
Things concurr'd to make this Man be|lieve
he had &s;een an Apparition, and heard
a Voice, and yet there was nothing in it
but the Voice of a Man un&s;een and mi&s;taken;
the young Man was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed at his
Friends declaring that he knew nothing of
his coming there, that he concluded it had
been all a Vi&s;ion or Apparition that opened
the Door, and that it was a Voice that had
&s;poken to him, of what Kind he knew not;
and the Reflection upon this &s;urpri&s;ed him &s;o
much as threw him into a Swound, and yet
here was neither Vi&s;ion or Voice, but that
of an ordinary Per&s;on, and one who meant
well, and &s;aid well.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted, but that many an Ap|parition
related with a great deal of Certainty
in the World, and of which good Ends have fol|low'd,
has been no more than &s;uch a &s;erious Mi|&s;take
as this.</P>
<P>But before I leave it, let me ob&s;erve, that this
&s;hould not at all hinder us from making a very
good U&s;e of &s;uch Things; for many a Voice may
be directed from Heaven, that is not immediately
&s;poken from thence; as when the Children cried
<HI>Ho&s;annah</HI> to our Saviour, they fulfilled the Scrip|ture,
which &s;aid out of the Mouths of Babes and
Sucklings thou ha&s;t ordain'd Prai&s;e; &s;o doubtle&s;s
he that made all Things and created all Things;
may appoint In&s;truction to be given by fortuitous
Accidents, and may direct concurring Circum|&s;tances
to touch and affect the Mind as much, and
as effectually, as if they had been immediate and
miraculous.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="372">
Thus was the two Per&s;ons happening to &s;ay the
&s;ame Words to the Athei&s;t, the &s;trange reading of
tho&s;e Lines, when the Per&s;on came into the Book|&s;eller's
Shop, the incident of his running into the
Shop for Shelter, and many the like Things of the
&s;ame Nature, and order'd in the &s;ame Manner as
the Cock crowing when <HI>Peter</HI> denied Chri&s;t, which
though wonderfully concurrent with what his
ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter had foretold, yet was no extraor|dinary
Thing in a Cock, who naturally Crows at
&s;uch a Time of the Morning.</P>
<P>In a Word, all the&s;e Things &s;erve to convince
us of a great Super-intendency of Divine Provi|dence
in the minute&s;t Affairs of this World, of a
manife&s;t Exi&s;tence of the invi&s;ible World, of the
Reality of Spirits, and of the Intelligence between
us and them. I hope I have &s;aid nothing of it to
mi&s;-guide any Body, or to a&s;&s;i&s;t them to delude
them&s;elves, having &s;poken of it with the utmo&s;t Se$riou&s;ne&s;s
in my De&s;ign, and with a &s;incere De&s;ire
for a General Good.</P>
