<HEAD>MEMOIRS
OF THE
PLAGUE.</HEAD>
<P>_IT was about the Beginning of <HI>Sep|tember</HI>
1664, that I, among the
Re&s;t of my Neighbours, heard in
ordinary Di&s;cour&s;e, that the Plague
was return'd again in <HI>Holland;</HI> for
it had been very violent there, and
particularly at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> and <HI>Ro|terdam,</HI>
in the Year 1663. whether <HI>they &s;ay,</HI> it was
brought, &s;ome &s;aid from <HI>Italy,</HI> others from the <HI>Le|vant</HI>
among &s;ome Goods, which were brought
home by their Turkey Fleet; others &s;aid it was
brought from <HI>Candia;</HI> others from <HI>Cyprus.</HI> It
matter'd not, from whence it come; but all a|greed,
it was come into <HI>Holland</HI> again.</P>
<P>We had no &s;uch thing as printed News Pa|pers
in tho&s;e Days, to &s;pread Rumours and Re|ports
of Things; and to improve them by the
Invention of Men, as I have liv'd to &s;ee practis'd
&s;ince. But &s;uch things as the&s;e were gather'd
<PB N="2" REF="4">
from the Letters of Merchants, and others, who
corre&s;ponded abroad, and from them was handed
about by Word of Mouth only; &s;o that things
did not &s;pread in&s;tantly over the whole Nation,
as they do now. But it &s;eems that the Govern|ment
had a true Account of it, and &s;everal Coun|&s;els
were held about Ways to prevent its coming
over; but all was kept very private. Hence it
was, that this Rumour died off again, and Peo|ple
began to forget it, as a thing we were very
little concern'd in, and that we hoped was not
true; till the latter End of <HI>November,</HI> or the Be|gining
of <HI>December</HI> 1664, when two Men, &s;aid
to be French-men, died of the Plague in <HI>Long
Acre,</HI> or rather at the upper End of <HI>Drury-Lane.</HI>
The Family they were in, endeavour'd to con|ceal
it as much as po&s;&s;ible; but as it had got|ten
&s;ome Vent in the Di&s;cour&s;e of the Neigh|bourhood,
the Secretaries of State gat Know|ledge
of it. And concerning them&s;elves to inquire
about it, in order to be certain of the Truth,
two Phy&s;icians and a Surgeon were order'd to
go to the Hou&s;e, and make In&s;pection. This
they did; and finding evident Tokens of the
Sickne&s;s upon both the Bodies that were dead,
they gave their Opinions publickly, that they
died of the Plague: Whereupon it was given in
to the Pari&s;h Clerk, and he al&s;o return'd them
to the Hall; and it was printed in the weekly
Bill of Mortality in the u&s;ual manner, thus,
<Q>Plague 2. Pari&s;hes infected 1.</Q></P>
<P>The People &s;hew'd a great Concern at this,
and began to be allarm'd all over the Town,
and the more, becau&s;e in the la&s;t Week in <HI>De|cember</HI>
1664, another Man died in the &s;ame
<PB N="3" REF="5">
Hou&s;e, and of the &s;ame Di&s;temper: And then
we were ea&s;y again for about &s;ix Weeks, when
none having died with any Marks of Infection,
it was &s;aid, the Di&s;temper was gone; but after
that, I think it was about the 12th of <HI>February,</HI>
another died in another Hou&s;e, but in the &s;ame
Pari&s;h, and in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>This turn'd the Peoples Eyes pretty much to|wards
that End of the Town; and the weekly
Bills &s;hewing an Encrea&s;e of Burials in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s
Pari&s;h more than u&s;ual, it began to be &s;u&s;pected,
that the Plague was among the People at that
End of the Town; and that many had died of it,
tho' they had taken Care to keep it as much
from the Knowlege of the Publick, as po&s;&s;ible:
This po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Heads of the People very much,
and few car'd to go thro' <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> or the
other Streets &s;u&s;pected, unle&s;s they had extraor|dinary
Bu&s;ine&s;s, that obliged them to it.</P>
<P>This Encrea&s;e of the Bills &s;tood thus; the u|&s;ual
Number of Burials in a Week, in the Pari&s;hes
of St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s in the Fields, and St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s Hol|born
were from 12 to 17 or 19 each few more
or le&s;s; but from the Time that the Plague fir&s;t
began in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Pari&s;h, it was ob&s;erv'd, that
the ordinary Burials encrea&s;ed in Number con&s;i|derably.

<P>Be&s;ides this, it was ob&s;erv'd with great Un|ea&s;ine&s;s
by the People, that the weekly Bill in
general encreas'd very much during the&s;e Weeks,
altho' it was at a Time of the Year, when u&s;ual|ly
the Bills are very moderate.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual Number of Burials within the Bills
of Mortality for a Week, was from about 240
or thereabouts, to 300. The la&s;t was e&s;teem'd a
pretty high Bill; but after this we found the Bills
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively encrea&s;ing, as follows.</P>

<P>This la&s;t Bill was really frightful, being a
higher Number than had been known to have
been buried in one Week, &s;ince the preceeding
Vi&s;itation of 1656.</P>
<P>However, all this went off again, and the
Weather proving cold, and the Fro&s;t which be|gan
in <HI>December,</HI> &s;till continuing very &s;evere, even
till near the End of <HI>February,</HI> attended with &s;harp
tho' moderate Winds, the Bills decreas'd again,
and the City grew healthy, and every body began
to look upon the Danger as good as over; only
that &s;till the Burials in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s continu'd high:
From the Beginning of <HI>April</HI> e&s;pecially they &s;tood
at 25 each Week, till the Week from the 18th to
the 25th, when there was buried in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s
<PB N="6" REF="8">
Pari&s;h 30, whereof two of the Plague, and 8 of
the Spotted-Feaver, which was look'd upon as the
&s;ame thing; likewi&s;e the Number that died of
the Spotted-Feaver in the whole increa&s;ed, being
8 the Week before, and 12 the Week above|named.</P>
<P>This alarm'd us all again, and terrible Appre|hen&s;ions
were among the People, e&s;pecially the
Weather being now chang'd and growing warm, and
the Summer being at Hand: However, the next
Week there &s;eem'd to be &s;ome Hopes again, the
Bills were low, the Number of the Dead in all
was but 388, there was none of the Plague, and
but four of the Spotted-Feaver.</P>
<P>But the following Week it return'd again, and
the Di&s;temper was &s;pread into two or three
other Pari&s;hes (<HI>viz.</HI>) St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s-<HI>Holborn,</HI> St. <HI>Cle|ment</HI>'s-<HI>Danes,</HI>
and to the great Affliction of the
City, one died within the Walls, in the Pari&s;h of
St. <HI>Mary-Wool-Church,</HI> that is to &s;ay, in <HI>Bearbinderlane</HI>
near the <HI>Stocks-market;</HI> in all there was nine of
the Plague, and &s;ix of the Spotted-Feaver. It
was however upon Inquiry found, that this <HI>French|man</HI>
who died in <HI>Bearbinder-lane,</HI> was one who
having liv'd in <HI>Long-Acre,</HI> near the infected Hou&s;es,
had removed for fear of the Di&s;temper, not know|ing
that he was already infected.</P>
<P>This was the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> yet the Wea|ther
was temperate, variable and cool enough-and
People had &s;till &s;ome Hopes: That which en|courag'd
them was, that the City was healthy,
the whole 97 Pari&s;hes buried but 54, and we be|gan
to hope, that as it was chiefly among the
People at that End of the Town, it might go no
farther; and the rather, becau&s;e the next Week
which was from the 9th of <HI>May</HI> to the 16th there
died but three, of which not one within the whole
<PB N="7" REF="9">
City or Liberties, and St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s buried but 15,
which was very low: 'Tis true, St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s buried
two and thirty, but &s;till as there was but one of
the Plague, People began to be ea&s;y, the whole
Bill al&s;o was very low, for the Week before, the Bill
was but 347, and the Week above-mentioned but
343: We continued in the&s;e Hopes for a few Days,
But it was but for a few; for the People were no
more to be deceived thus; they &s;earcht the Hou&s;es,
and found that the Plague was really &s;pread every
way, and that many died of it every Day: So that
now all our Extenuations abated, and it was no
more to be concealed, nay it quickly appeared that
the Infection had &s;pread it &s;elf beyond all Hopes of
Abatement; that in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s, it
was gotten into &s;everal Streets, and &s;everal Fami|lies
lay all &s;ick together; And accordingly in the
Weekly Bill for the next Week, the thing began to
&s;hew it &s;elf; there was indeed but 14 &s;et down of
the Plague, but this was all Knavery and Collu|&s;ion,
for in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Pari&s;h they buried 40 in all,
whereof it was certain mo&s;t of them died of the
Plague, though they were &s;et down of other Di|&s;tempers;
and though the Number of all the Bu|rials
were not increa&s;ed above 32, and the whole
Bill being but 385, yet there was 14 of the Spot|ted-Feaver,
as well as 14 of the Plague; and we
took it for granted upon the whole, that there
was 50 died that Week of the Plague.</P>
<P>The next Bill was from the 23d of <HI>May</HI> to the
30th, when the Number of the Plague was 17:
But the Burials in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s were 53, a frightful
Number! of whom they &s;et down but 9 of the
Plague: But on an Examination more &s;trictly by
the Ju&s;tices of the Peace, and at the Lord Mayor's
Reque&s;t, it was found there were 20 more, who
were really dead of the Plague in that Pari&s;h, but
<PB N="8" REF="10">
had been &s;et down of the Spotted-Feaver or
other Di&s;tempers, be&s;ides others concealed.</P>
<P>But tho&s;e were trifling Things to what followed
immediately after; for now the Weather &s;et in hot,
and from the fir&s;t Week in <HI>June,</HI> the Infection
&s;pread in a dreadful Manner, and the Bills ri&s;e
high, the Articles of the Feaver, Spotted-Feaver,
and Teeth, began to &s;well: For all that could con|ceal
their Di&s;tempers, did it to prevent their
Neighbours &s;hunning and refu&s;ing to conver&s;e
with them; and al&s;o to prevent Authority &s;hut|ting
up their Hou&s;es, which though it was not
yet practi&s;ed, yet was threatned, and People were
extremely terrify'd at the Thoughts of it.</P>
<P>The Second Week in <HI>June,</HI> the Pari&s;h of
St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s, where &s;till the Weight of the Infection
lay, buried 120, whereof though the Bills &s;aid but
68 of the Plague; every Body &s;aid there had been
100 at lea&s;t, calculating it from the u&s;ual Number
of Funerals in that Pari&s;h as above.</P>
<P>Till this Week the City continued free, there
having never any died except that one <HI>Frenchman,</HI>
who I mention'd before, within the whole 97 Pa|ri&s;hes.
Now there died four within the City, one
in <HI>Wood$&s;treet,</HI> one in <HI>Fenchurch &s;treet,</HI> and two in
<HI>Crooked-lane: Southwark</HI> was entirely free, ha|ving
not one yet died on that Side of the Water.</P>
<P>I liv'd without <HI>Aldgate</HI> about mid-way between
<HI>Aldgate Church</HI> and <HI>White-Chappel-Bars,</HI> on the left
Hand or North-&s;ide of the Street; and as the
Di&s;temper had not reach'd to that Side of the City,
our Neighbourhood continued very ea&s;y: But at
the other End of the Town, their Con&s;ternation
was very great; and the richer &s;ort of People, e&s;|pecially
the Nobility and Gentry, from the We&s;t-part
of the City throng'd out of Town, with their
Families and Servants in an unu&s;ual Manner; and
this was more particularly &s;een in <HI>White-Chapel;</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="11">
that is to &s;ay, the Broad-&s;treet where I liv'd: Indeed
nothing was to be &s;een but Waggons and Carts,
with Goods, Women, Servants, Children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Coaches fill'd with People of the better Sort,
and Hor&s;emen attending them, and all hurrying
away; then empty Waggons, and Carts appear'd and
Spare-hor&s;es with Servants, who it was apparent
were returning or &s;ent from the Countries to fetch
more People: Be&s;ides innumerable Numbers of
Men on Hor&s;eback, &s;ome alone, others with Ser|vants,
and generally &s;peaking, all loaded with Bag|gage
and fitted out for travelling, as any one might
perceive by their Appearance.</P>
<P>This was a very terrible and melancholy Thing
to &s;ee, and as it was a Sight which I cou'd not but
look on from Morning to Night; for indeed there
was nothing el&s;e of Moment to be &s;een, it filled me
with very &s;erious Thoughts of the Mi&s;ery that was
coming upon the City, and the unhappy Condition
of tho&s;e that would be left in it.</P>
<P>This Hurry of the People was &s;uch for &s;ome
Weeks, that there was no getting at the Lord-Mayor's
Door without exceeding Difficulty; there
was &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing and crouding there to get pa&s;&s;es
and Certificates of Health, for &s;uch as travelled
abroad; for without the&s;e, there was no being
admitted to pa&s;s thro' the Towns upon the Road,
or to lodge in any Inn: Now as there had none
died in the City for all this time, My Lord Mayor
gave Certificates of Health without any Diffi|culty
to all tho&s;e who liv'd in the 97 Pari&s;hes, and
to tho&s;e within the Liberties too for a while.</P>
<P>This Hurry, I &s;ay, continued &s;ome Weeks, that
is to &s;ay, all the Month of <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June,</HI> and the
more becau&s;e it was rumour'd that an order of
the Government was to be i&s;&s;ued out, to place
Turn-pikes and Barriers on the Road, to prevent
<PB N="10" REF="12">
Peoples travelling; and that the Towns on the
Road, would not &s;uffer People from <HI>London</HI> to pa&s;s,
for fear of bringing the Infection along with them,
though neither of the&s;e Rumours had any Foun|dation,
but in the Imagination; e&s;pecially at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I now began to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly with my Self,
concerning my own Ca&s;e, and how I &s;hould di&s;|po&s;e
of my &s;elf; that is to &s;ay, whether I &s;hould
re&s;olve to &s;tay in <HI>London,</HI> or &s;hut up my Hou&s;e and
flee, as many of my Neighbours did. I have
&s;et this particular down &s;o fully, becau&s;e I know
not but it may be of Moment to tho&s;e who come
after me, if they come to be brought to the &s;ame
Di&s;tre&s;s, and to the &s;ame Manner of making their
Choice and therefore I de&s;ire this Account may pa&s;s
with them, rather for a Direction to them&s;elves to
act by, than a Hi&s;tory of my actings, &s;eeing it may
not be of one Farthing value to them to note what
became of me.</P>
<P>I had two important things before me; the one
was the carrying on my Bu&s;ine&s;s and Shop;
which was con&s;iderable, and in which was em|bark'd
all my Effects in the World; and the other
was the Pre&s;ervation of my Life in &s;o di&s;mal a
Calamity, as I &s;aw apparently was coming upon
the whole City; and which however great it was,
my Fears perhaps as well as other Peoples, repre|&s;ented
to be much greater than it could be</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Con&s;ideration was of great Moment
to me; my Trade was <HI>a Sadler,</HI> and as my Deal|ings
were chiefly not by a Shop or Chance Trade,
but among the Merchants, trading to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> &s;o my Effects lay very much
in the hands of &s;uch. I was a &s;ingle Man 'tis true,
but I had a Family of Servants, who I kept at
my Bu&s;ine&s;s, had a Hou&s;e, Shop, and Ware-hou&s;es
fill'd with Goods; and in &s;hort, to leave them all
as things in &s;uch a Ca&s;e mu&s;t be left, that is to
<PB N="11" REF="13">
&s;ay, without any Over&s;eer or Per&s;on fit to be
tru&s;ted with them, had been to hazard the Lo&s;s
not only of my Trade, but of my Goods, and
indeed of all I had in the World.</P>
<P>I had an Elder Brother at the &s;ame Time in
<HI>London,</HI> and not many Years before come over
from <HI>Portugal;</HI> and advi&s;ing with him, his An&s;wer
was in three Words the &s;ame that was given
in another Ca&s;e quite different, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>Ma&s;ter &s;ave
thy &s;elf.</HI> In a Word, he was for my retiring into the
Country, as he re&s;olv'd to do him&s;elf with his Fa|mily;
telling me, what he had it &s;eems, heard a|broad,
that the be&s;t Preparation for the Plague
was to run away from it. As to my Argument
of lo&s;ing my Trade, my Goods, or Debts, he
quite confuted me: He told me the &s;ame thing,
which I argued for my &s;taying, (<HI>viz</HI>) <HI>That I would
tru&s;t God with my Safety and Health,</HI> was the
&s;tronge&s;t Repul&s;e to my Pretentions of lo&s;ing my
Trade and my Goods; for, &s;ays he, is it not as
rea&s;onable that you &s;hould tru&s;t God with the
Chance or Ri&s;que of lo&s;ing your Trade, as that
you &s;hould &s;tay in &s;o imminent a Point of Danger,
and tru&s;t him with your Life?</P>
<P>I could not argue that I was in any Strait, as
to a Place where to go, having &s;everal Friends
and Relations in <HI>Northampton&s;hire,</HI> whence our Fa|mily
fir&s;t came from; and particularly, I had an
only Si&s;ter in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> very willing to receive
and entertain me.</P>
<P>My Brother, who had already &s;ent his Wife and
two Children into <HI>Bedford&s;hire,</HI> and re&s;olv'd to
follow them, pre&s;s'd my going very earne&s;tly;
and I had once re&s;olv'd to comply with his De|&s;ires,
but at that time could get no Hor&s;e: For
tho' it is true, all the People did not go out of
the City of <HI>London;</HI> yet I may venture to &s;ay, that
in a manner all the Hor&s;es did; for there was
<PB N="12" REF="14">
hardly a Hor&s;e to be bought or hired in the
whole City for &s;ome Weeks. Once I re&s;olv'd to
travel on Foot with one Servant; and as many
did, lie at no Inn, but carry a Soldiers Tent with
us, and &s;o lie in the Fields, the Weather being
very warm, and no Danger from taking cold: I
&s;ay, as many did, becau&s;e &s;everal did &s;o at la&s;t,
e&s;pecially tho&s;e who had been in the Armies in
the War which had not been many Years pa&s;t;
and I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that &s;peaking of &s;econd Cau&s;es,
had mo&s;t of the People that travelled, done &s;o, the
Plague had not been carried into &s;o many Coun|try-Towns
and Hou&s;es, as it was, to the great Da|mage,
and indeed to the Ruin of abundance of
People.</P>
<P>But then my Servant who I had intended to
take down with me, deceiv'd me; and being
frighted at the Encrea&s;e of the Di&s;temper, and
not knowing when I &s;hould go, he took other Mea|&s;ures,
and left me, &s;o I was put off for that Time;
and one way or other, I always found that to ap|point
to go away was always cro&s;s'd by &s;ome
Accident or other, &s;o as to di&s;appoint and put it
off again; and this brings in a Story which other|wi&s;e
might be thought a needle&s;s Digre&s;&s;ion,
(<HI>viz,</HI>) about the&s;e Di&s;appointments being from
Heaven.</P>
<P>I mention this Story al&s;o as the be&s;t Method
I can advi&s;e any Per&s;on to take in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, e|&s;pecially,
if he be one that makes Con&s;cience of
his Duty, and would be directed what to do in
it, namely, that he &s;hould keep his Eye upon the
particular Providences which occur at that Time,
and look upon them complexly, as they regard
one another, and as altogether regard the Que|&s;tion
before him, and then I think, he may &s;afely
take them for Intimations from Heaven of what
is his unque&s;tion'd Duty to do in &s;uch a Ca&s;e;
<PB N="13" REF="15">
I mean as to going away from, or &s;taying in the
Place where we dwell, when vi&s;ited with an in|fectious
Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>It came very warmly into my Mind, one
Morning, as I was mu&s;ing on this particular thing,
that as nothing attended us without the Direction
or Permi&s;&s;ion of Divine Power, &s;o the&s;e Di&s;ap|pointments
mu&s;t have &s;omething in them extraor|dinary;
and I ought to con&s;ider whether it did
not evidently point out, or intimate to me, that it
was the Will of Heaven I &s;hould not go. It im|mediately
follow'd in my Thoughts, that if it real|ly
was from God, that I &s;hould &s;tay, he was able
effectually to pre&s;erve me in the mid&s;t of all the
Death and Danger that would &s;urround me; and
that if I attempted to &s;ecure my &s;elf by fleeing
from my Habitation, and acted contrary to the&s;e
Intimations, which I believed to be Divine, it was
a kind of flying from God, and that he could
cau&s;e his Ju&s;tice to overtake me when and where
he thought fit.</P>
<P>The&s;e thoughts quite turn'd my Re&s;olutions a|gain,
and when I came to di&s;cour&s;e with my Bro|ther
again I told him, that I enclin'd to &s;tay and
take my Lot in that Station in which God had
plac'd me; and that it &s;eem'd to be made more
e&s;pecially my Duty, on the Account of what I
have &s;aid.</P>
<P>My Brother, tho' a very Religious Man him|&s;elf,
laught at all I had &s;ugge&s;ted about its being
an Intimation from Heaven, and told me &s;everal
Stories of &s;uch fool-hardy People, <HI>as he call'd them,</HI>
as I was; that I ought indeed to &s;ubmit to it as
a Work of Heaven, if I had been any way di&s;abled
by Di&s;tempers or Di&s;ea&s;es, and that then not be|ing
able to go, I ought to acquie&s;ce in the Di|rection
of him, who having been my Maker, had
an undi&s;puted Right of Soveraignity in di&s;po&s;ing
<PB N="14" REF="16">
of me; and that then there had been no Diffi|culty
to determine which was the Call of his Pro|vidence,
and which was not: But that I &s;hould
take it as an Intimation from Heaven, that I
&s;hould not go out of Town, only becau&s;e I could
not hire a Hor&s;e to go, or my Fellow was run away
that was to attend me, was ridiculous, &s;ince at the
&s;ame Time I had my Health and Limbs, and other
Servants, and might, with Ea&s;e, travel a Day or
two on foot, and having a good Certificate of
being in perfect Health, might either hire a Hor&s;e,
or take Po&s;t on the Road, as I thought fit.</P>
<P>Then he proceeded to tell me of the mi&s;chei|vous
Con&s;equences which attended the Pre&s;um|ption
of the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Mahometans</HI> in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and
in other Places, where he had been (for my Bro|ther
being a Merchant, was a few Years before,
as I have already ob&s;erv'd, returned from abroad,
coming la&s;t from <HI>Lisbon</HI>) and how pre&s;uming up|on
their profe&s;s'd prede&s;tinating Notions, and of
every Man's End being predetermin'd and unalte|rably
before-hand decreed, they would go uncon|cern'd
into infected Places, and conver&s;e with in|fected
Per&s;ons, by which Means they died at the
Rate of Ten or Fifteen Thou&s;and a-Week, whereas
the <HI>Europeans,</HI> or Chri&s;tian Merchants, who kept
them&s;elves retired and re&s;erv'd, generally e&s;cap'd
the Contagion.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Arguments my Brother chang'd
my Re&s;olutions again, and I began to re&s;olve to
go, and accordingly made all things ready; for
in &s;hort, the Infection increa&s;ed round me, and
the Bills were ri&s;en to almo&s;t 700 a-Week, and
my Brother told me, he would venture to &s;tay no
longer. I de&s;ir'd him to let me con&s;ider of it but
till the next Day, and I would re&s;olve; and
as I had already prepar'd every thing as well
as I could, as to my Bu&s;ine&s;s, and who to en|tru&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="17">
my Affairs with, I had little to do but to re|&s;olve.</P>
<P>I went Home that Evening greatly oppre&s;s'd in
my Mind, irre&s;olute, and not knowing what to
do; I had &s;et the Evening wholly apart to con|&s;ider
&s;eriou&s;ly about it, and was all alone; for al|ready
People had, as it were by a general Con|&s;ent,
taken up the Cu&s;tom of not going out of
Doors after Sun-&s;et, the Rea&s;ons I &s;hall have Oc|ca&s;ion
to &s;ay more of by-and-by.</P>
<P>In the Retirement of this Evening I endeavou|red
to re&s;olve fir&s;t, what was my Duty to do,
and I &s;tated the Arguments with which my Bro|ther
had pre&s;s'd me to go into the Country, and
I &s;et again&s;t them the &s;trong Impre&s;&s;ions which
I had on my Mind for &s;taying; the vi&s;ible Call I
&s;eem'd to have from the particular Circum&s;tance
of my Calling, and the Care due from me for
the Pre&s;ervation of my Effects, which were, as I
might &s;ay, my E&s;tate; al&s;o the Intimations which
I thought I had from Heaven, that to me &s;ig|nify'd
a kind of Direction to venture, and it oc|curr'd
to me, that if I had what I might call
a Direction to &s;tay, I ought to &s;uppo&s;e it con|tain'd
a Promi&s;e of being pre&s;erved, if I obey'd.</P>
<P>This lay clo&s;e to me, and my Mind &s;eemed
more and more encouraged to &s;tay than ever, and
&s;upported with a &s;ecret Satisfaction, that I &s;hould
be kept: Add to this that turning over the Bible,
which lay before me, and while my Thoughts
were more than ordinarily &s;erious upon the Que|&s;tion,
I cry'd out, WELL, <HI>I know not what to
do, Lord direct me!</HI> and the like; and that Jun|cture
I happen'd to &s;top turning over the Book at
the 91<HI>&s;t P&s;alm,</HI> and ca&s;ting my Eye on the &s;econd
Ver&s;e, I read on to the 7th Ver&s;e exclu&s;ive; and
after that, included the 10th, as follows. <HI>I will
&s;ay of the Lord, He is my refuge, and my foretre&s;s,
<PB N="16" REF="18">
my God, in him will I tru&s;t. Surely he &s;hall de|liver
thee from the &s;nare of the fowler, and from the
noi&s;om pe&s;tilence. He &s;hall cover the with his fea|thers,
and under his wings &s;halt thou tru&s;t: his truth
&s;hall be thy &s;hield and buckler. Thou &s;halt not be
afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow
that flieth by day: Nor for the pe&s;tilence that walk|eth
in darkne&s;s: nor for the de&s;truction that wa&s;teth
at noon-day. A thou&s;and &s;hall fall at thy &s;ide and
ten thou&s;and at thy right hand: but it &s;hall not come
nigh thee. Only with thine Eyes &s;halt thou behold and
&s;ee the reward of the wicked. Becau&s;e thou ha&s;t made
the Lord which is my refuge, even the mo&s;t High, thy
habitation: There &s;hall no evil befal thee, neither &s;hall
any plague come nigh thy dwelling,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I &s;carce need tell the Reader, that from that
Moment I re&s;olv'd that I would &s;tay in the Town,
and ea&s;ting my &s;elf entirely upon the Goodne&s;s
and Protection of the Almighty, would not
&s;eek any other Shelter whatever; and that as my
Times were in his Hands, he was as able to keep
me in a Time of the Infection as in a Time of
Health; and if he did not think fit to deliver me,
&s;till I was in his Hands, and it was meet he &s;hould
do with me as &s;hould &s;eem good to him.</P>
<P>With this Re&s;olution I went to Bed; and I was
farther confirm'd in it the next Day, by the Wo|man
being taken ill with whom I had intended to
entru&s;t my Hou&s;e and all my Affairs: But I had
a farther Obligation laid on me on the &s;ame Side;
for the next Day I found my &s;elf very much out
of Order al&s;o; &s;o that if I would have gone away,
I could not, and I continued ill three or four Days,
and this intirely determin'd my Stay; &s;o I took
my leave of my Brother, who went away to
<HI>Darking</HI> in <HI>Surry.</HI> and afterwards fetch'd a Round
farther into <HI>Buckingham&s;hire,</HI> or <HI>Bedford&s;hire,</HI> to a
Retreat he had found out there for his Family.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">
It was a very ill Time to be &s;ick in, for if any
one complain'd, it was immediately &s;aid he had the
Plague; and tho' I had indeed no Symptoms of
that Di&s;temper, yet being very ill, both in my
Head and in my Stomach, I was not without Ap|prehen&s;ion,
that I really was in&s;ected; but in a|bout
three Days I grew better, the third Night
I re&s;ted well, &s;weated a little, and was much re|fre&s;h'd;
the Apprehen&s;ions of its being the Infe|ction
went al&s;o quite away with my Illne&s;s, and I
went about my Bu&s;ine&s;s as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things however put off all my Thoughts
of going into the Country; and my Brother al&s;o
being gone, I had no more Debate either with him,
or with my &s;elf, on that Subject.</P>
<P>It was now mid-<HI>July,</HI> and the Plague which
had chiefly rag'd at the other End of the Town,
and as I &s;aid before, in the Pari&s;hes of St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s,
St. <HI>Andrews Holbourn,</HI> and towards <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI>
began now to come <HI>Ea&s;tward</HI> towards the Part
where I liv'd. It was to be ob&s;erv'd indeed, that
it did not come &s;trait on towards us; for the
City, that is to &s;ay within the Walls, was indif|ferent
healthy &s;till; nor was it got then very much
over the Water into <HI>Southwark;</HI> for tho' there di|ed
that Week 1268 of all Di&s;tempers, whereof it
might be &s;uppos'd above 900 died of the Plague;
yet there was but 28 in the whole City, within
the Walls; and but 19 in <HI>Southwark, Lambeth</HI>
Pari&s;h included; whereas in the Pari&s;hes of St.
<HI>Giles,</HI> and St. <HI>Martins in the Fields</HI> alone, there
died 421.</P>
<P>But we perceiv'd the Infection keept chiefly in the
out-Pari&s;hes, which being very populous, and
fuller al&s;o of Poor, the Di&s;temper found more to
prey upon than in the City, as I &s;hall ob&s;erve after|ward;
we perceiv'd I &s;ay, the Di&s;temper to draw
our Way; (<HI>viz.</HI>) by the Pari&s;hes of <HI>Clerken-Well,
<PB N="18" REF="20">
Cripplegate, Shoreditch,</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate;</HI> which la&s;t
two Pari&s;hes joining to <HI>Aldgate, White-Chapel,</HI> and
<HI>Stepney,</HI> the Infection came at length to &s;pread its
utmo&s;t Rage and violence in tho&s;e Parts, even
when it abated, at the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Pari&s;hes where
it began.</P>
<P>It was very &s;trange to ob&s;erve, that in this
particular Week, from the 4th to the 11th of <HI>July,</HI>
when, as I have ob&s;erv'd, there died near 400
of the Plague in the two Pari&s;hes of St. <HI>Martin's,</HI>
and St. <HI>Giles in the Fields</HI> only, three died in the
Pari&s;h of <HI>Aldgate</HI> but four, in the Pari&s;h of <HI>White-Chapel</HI>
three, in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Stepney</HI> but one.</P>
<P>L$kewi&s;e in the next Week, from the 11th of
<HI>July</HI> to the 18th, when the Week's Bill was
1761, yet there died no more of the Plague, on
the whole <HI>Southwark</HI> Side of the Water than &s;ix|teen.</P>
<P>But this Face of things &s;oon changed, and it
began to thicken in <HI>Cripplegate</HI> Pari&s;h e&s;pecially,
and in <HI>Clerken-Well;</HI> &s;o, that by the &s;econd Week
in <HI>Augu&s;t, Cripplegate</HI> Pari&s;h alone, buried eight
hundred eighty &s;ix, and <HI>Clerken-Well</HI> 155; of the
fir&s;t eight hundred and fifty, might well be rec|koned
to die of the Plague; and of the la&s;t, the
Bill it &s;elf &s;aid, 145 were of the Plague.</P>
<P>During the Month of <HI>July,</HI> and while, as I have
ob&s;erv'd, our Part of the Town &s;eem'd to be or|&s;par'd,
in Compari&s;on of the <HI>We&s;t</HI> part, I went or|dinarily
about the Streets, as my Bu&s;ine&s;s requir'd,
and particularly went generally, once in a Day,
or in two Days, into the City, to my Brother's
Hou&s;e, which he had given me charge of, and to
&s;ee if it was &s;afe: And having the Key in my
Pocket, I u&s;ed to go into the Hou&s;e, and over
mo&s;t of the Rooms, to &s;ee that all was well; for
tho' it be &s;omething wond$rful to tell, that any
&s;hould have Hearts &s;o hardned, in the mid&s;t of
<PB N="19" REF="21">
&s;uch a Calamity, as to rob and &s;teal; yet certain
it is, that all Sorts of Villanies&punc; and even Le|vities
and Debaucheries were then practis'd in
the Town, as openlyas ever, I will not &s;ay quite
as frequently, becau&s;e the Numbers of People
were many ways le&s;&s;en'd.</P>
<P>But the City it &s;elf began now to be vi&s;ited
too, I mean within the Walls; but the Number
of People there were indeed extreamly le&s;&s;en'd by
&s;o great a Multitude having been gone into the
Country; and even all this Month of <HI>July</HI> they
continu'd to flee, tho' not in &s;uch Multitudes as
formerly. In <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> indeed, they fled in &s;uch a
manner, that I began to think, there would be
really none but Magi&s;trates and Servants left in
the City.</P>
<P>As they fled now out of the City, &s;o I &s;hould
ob&s;erve, that the Court removed early, (<HI>viz.</HI>) in
the Month of <HI>June,</HI> and went to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where
it pleas'd God to pre&s;erve them; and the Di&s;tem|per
did not, <HI>as I heacd of,</HI> &s;o much as touch them;
for which I cannot &s;ay, that I ever &s;aw they
&s;hew'd any great Token of Thankfulne&s;s, and hard|ly
any thing of Reformation, tho' they did not
want being told that their crying Vices might,
without Breach of Charity, be &s;aid to have gone
fa$, in bringing that terrible Judgment upon the
whole Nation.</P>
<P>The Face of <HI>London</HI> was now indeed &s;trangely
alter'd, I mean the whole Ma&s;s of Buildings, Ci|ty,
Liberties, Suburbs, <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter, Southwark</HI> and
altogether; for as to the particular Part called
the City, or within the Walls, that was not yet
much infected; but in the whole, the Face of
Things, I &s;ay, was much alter'd; Sorrow and
Sadne&s;s &s;at upon every Face; and tho' &s;ome Part
were not yet overwhelm'd, yet all look'd deeply con|cern'd;
and as we &s;aw it apparently coming on,
<PB N="20" REF="22">
&s;o every one look'd on him&s;elf, and his Family,
as in the utmo&s;t Danger: were it po&s;&s;ible to repre|&s;ent
tho&s;e Times exactly to tho&s;e that did not &s;ee
them, and give the Reader due Ideas of the Horror
that every where pre&s;ented it &s;elf, it mu&s;t make
ju&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions upon their Minds, and fill them
with Surprize. <HI>London</HI> might well be &s;aid to be
all in Tears; the Mourners did not go about the
Streets indeed, for no Body put on black, or made
a formal Dre&s;s of Mourning for their neare&s;t
Friends; but the Voice of Mourning was truly
heard in the Streets; the &s;hriecks of Women and
Children at the Windows, and Doors of their
Hou&s;es, where their deare&s;t Relations were, per|haps
dying, or ju&s;t dead, were &s;o frequent to be
heard, as we pa&s;&s;ed the S$r$ets, that it was e|nough
to pierce the &s;toute&s;t Heart in the World,
to hear them. Tears and Lamentations were &s;een
almo&s;t in every Hou&s;e, e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t Part
of the Vi&s;itation; for towards the latter End,
Mens Hearts were hardned, and Death was &s;o al|ways
before their Eyes, that they did not &s;o much
concern them&s;elves for the Lo&s;s of their Friends,
expecting, that them&s;elves &s;hould be &s;ummoned
the next Hour.</P>
<P>Bu&s;ine&s;s led me out &s;ometimes to the other
End of the Town, even when the Sickne&s;s was
chiefly there; and as the thing was new to me,
as well as to every Body el&s;e, it was a mo&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;ing
thing, to &s;ee tho&s;e Streets, which were u|&s;ually
&s;o thronged, now grown de&s;olate, and &s;o
few People to be &s;een in them, that if I had been
a Stranger, and at a Lo&s;s for my Way, I might
&s;ometimes have gone the Length of a whole Street,
I mean of the by-Streets, and &s;ee no Body to di|rect
me, except Watchmen, &s;et at the Doors of
&s;uch Hou&s;es as were &s;hut up; of which I &s;hall
&s;peak pre&s;ently.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23">
One Day, being at that Part of the Town, on
&s;ome &s;pecial Bu&s;ine&s;s, Curio&s;ity led me to ob&s;erve
things more than u&s;ually; and indeed I walk'd a
great Way where I had no Bu&s;ine&s;s; I went up <HI>Hol|bourn,</HI>
and there the Street was full of People; but
they walk'd in the middle of the great Street, nei|ther
on one Side or other, becau&s;e, as I &s;uppo&s;e,
they would not mingle with any Body that came
out of Hou&s;es, or meet with Smells and Scents
from Hou&s;es that might be infected.</P>
<P>The Inns-of-Court were all &s;hut up; nor were
very many of the Lawyers in the Temple, or
<HI>Lincolns-Inn,</HI> or <HI>Greyes-Inn,</HI> to be &s;een there. Every
Body was at peace, there was no Occa&s;ion for
Lawyers; be&s;ides, it being in the Time of the Va|cation
too, they were generally gone into the Coun|try.
Whole Rows of Hou&s;es in &s;ome Places,
were &s;hut clo&s;e up; the Inhabitants all fled, and
only a Watchman or two left.</P>
<P>When I &s;peak of Rows of Hou&s;es being &s;hut
up, I do non mean &s;hut up by the Magi&s;trates;
but that great Numbers of Per&s;ons followed the
Court, by the Nece&s;&s;ity of their Employments, and
other Dependencies: and as others retir'd, really
frighted with the Di&s;temper, it was a mere de&s;o|lating
of &s;ome of the Streets: But the Fright was
not yet near &s;o great in the City, ab&s;tractly &s;o
called; and particularly becau&s;e, tho' they were
at fir&s;t in a mo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;ible Con&s;ternation, yet as
I have ob&s;erv'd, that the Di&s;temper intermitted
often at fir&s;t; &s;o they were as it were, allarm'd,
and unallarm'd again, and this &s;everal times, till
it began to be familiar to them; and that even,
when it appear'd violent, yet &s;eeing it did not pre|&s;ently
&s;pread into the City, or the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and
<HI>South</HI> Parts, the People began to take Courage,
and to be, as I may &s;ay, a little hardned: It
is true, a va&s;t many People fled, as I have ob|&s;erv'd,
<PB N="22" REF="24">
yet they were chiefly from the <HI>We&s;t</HI> End
of the Town; and from that we call the Heart
of the City, that is to &s;ay, among the wealthie&s;t
of the People; and &s;uch People as were unincum|bred
with Trades and Bu&s;ine&s;s: But of the re&s;t,
the Generality &s;tay'd, and &s;eem'd to abide the
wor&s;t: So that in the Place we call the Liberties,
and in the Suburbs, in <HI>Southwark,</HI> and in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>
Part, &s;uch as <HI>Wapping, Ratclif, Stepney, Rotherhith,</HI> and
the like, the People generally &s;tay'd, except here
and there a few wealthy Families, who, as above,
did not depend upon their Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be forgot here, that the City and Su|burbs
were prodigiou&s;ly full of People, at the time
of this Vi&s;itation, I mean, at the time that it be|gan;
for tho' I have liv'd to &s;ee a farther Encrea&s;e,
and mighty Throngs of People &s;ettling in <HI>London,</HI>
more than ever, yet we had always a Notion, that
the Numbers of People, which the Wars being o|ver,
the Armies disbanded, and the Royal Family
and the Monarchy being re&s;tor'd, had flock'd to
<HI>London,</HI> to &s;ettle into Bu&s;ine&s;s; or to depend upon,
and attend the Court for Rewards of Services, Pre|ferments,
<HI>and the like,</HI> was &s;uch, that the Town
was computed to have in it above a hundred thou|&s;and
people more than ever it held before; nay,
&s;ome took upon them to &s;ay, it had twice as ma|ny,
becau&s;e all the ruin'd Families of the royal
Party, flock'd hither: All the old Soldiers &s;et up
Trades here, and abundance of Families &s;ettled
here; again, the Court brought with them a
great Flux of Pride, and new Fa&s;hions; All Peo|ple
were grown gay and luxurious; and the Joy
of the Re&s;toration had brought a va&s;t many Fami|lies
to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>I often thought, that as <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was befieg'd
by the <HI>Romans,</HI> when the <HI>Jews</HI> were a&s;&s;embled to|gether,
to celebrate the Pa&s;&s;over, by which means,
<PB N="23" REF="25">
an incredible Number of People were &s;urpriz'd
there, who would otherwi&s;e have been in other
Countries: So the Plague entred <HI>London,</HI> when an
incredible Increa&s;e of People had happened oc|ca&s;ionally,
by the particular Circum&s;tances above|nam'd:
As this Conflux of the People, to a youth|ful
and gay Court, made a great Trade in the
City, e&s;pecially in every thing that belong'd to
Fa&s;hion and Finery; So it drew by Con&s;equence,
a great Number of Work-men, Manufacturers, and
the like, being mo&s;tly poor People, who depended
upon their Labour, And I remember in particular,
that in a Repre&s;entation to my Lord Mayor, of
the Condition of the Poor, it was e&s;timated, that,
there were no le&s;s than an Hundred Thou&s;and
Ribband Weavers in and about the City; the chie|fe&s;t
Number of whom, lived then in the Pari&s;hes
of <HI>Shoreditch, Stepney, White-chapel,</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate;</HI>
that namely, about <HI>Spittle-fields;</HI> that is to &s;ay,
as <HI>Spittle-fields</HI> was then; for it was not &s;o large
as now, by one fifth Part.</P>
<P>By this however, the Number of People in the
whole may be judg'd of; and indeed, I often won|dred,
that after the prodigious Numbers of Peo|ple
that went away at fir&s;t, there was yet &s;o
great a Multitude left, as it appear'd there was.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t go back again to the Beginning of
this Surprizing Time, while the Fears of the
People were young, they were encreas'd &s;trangely
by &s;everal odd Accidents, which put altogether,
it was realy a wonder the whole Body of the
People did not ri&s;e as one Man, and abandon
their Dwellings, leaving the Place as a Space of
Ground de&s;igned by Heaven for an Akeldama,
doom'd to be de&s;troy'd from the Face of the
Earth; and that all that would be found in it,
would peri&s;h with it. I &s;hall Name but a few
of the&s;e Things; but &s;ure they were &s;o many, and
<PB N="24" REF="26">
&s;o many Wizards and cunning People propagating
them, that I have often wonder'd there was any,
(Women e&s;pecially,) left behind.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, a blazing Star or Comet ap|pear'd
for &s;everal Months before the Plague, as
there did the Year after another, a little before the
Fire; the old Women, and the Phlegmatic Hy|pocondriac
Part of the other Sex, who I could al|mo&s;t
call <HI>old Women</HI> too, remark'd (e&s;pecially after|ward
tho' not, till both tho&s;e Judgments were over,)
that tho&s;e two Comets pa&s;s'd directly over the
City, and that &s;o very near the Hou&s;es, that it
was plain, they imported &s;omething peculiar to
the City alone; that the Comet before the Pe&s;ti|lence,
was of a faint, dull, languid Colour, and
its Motion very heavy, &s;olemn and &s;low: But
that the Comet before the Fire, was bright and
&s;parkling, or as others &s;aid, flaming, and its
Motion &s;wift and furious; and that accord|ingly,
One foretold a heavy Judgment, &s;low but
&s;evere, terrible and frightful, as was the Plague;
But the other foretold a Stroak, &s;udden, &s;wift, and
fiery as the Conflagration; nay, &s;o particular &s;ome
People were, that as they look'd upon that Co|met
preceding the Fire, they fancied that they not
only &s;aw it pa&s;s &s;wiftly and fiercely, and cou'd per|ceive
the Motion with their Eye, but even they
heard it; that it made a ru&s;hing mighty Noi&s;e,
fierce and terrible, tho' at a di&s;tance, and but ju&s;t
perceivable.</P>
<P>I &s;aw both the&s;e Stars; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, had
&s;o much of the common Notion of &s;uch Things in
my Head, that I was apt to look upon them, as
the Forerunners and Warnings of Gods Judgments;
and e&s;pecially when after the Plague had followed
the fir&s;t, I yet &s;aw another of the like kind; I
could not but &s;ay, God had not yet &s;ufficiently
&s;courg'd the City.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27">
But I cou'd not at the &s;ame Time carry the&s;e
Things to the heighth that others did, knowing
too, that natural Cau&s;es are a&s;&s;ign'd by the A&s;tro|nomers
for &s;uch Things; and that their Motions,
and even their Revolutions are calculated, or pre|ded
to be calculated; &s;o that they cannot be &s;o
perfectly call'd the Fore-runners, or Fore-tellers,
much le&s;s the procurers of &s;uch Events, as Pe&s;ti|lence,
War, Fire, and the like.</P>
<P>But let my Thoughts, and the Thoughts of the
Philo&s;ophers be, or have been what they will,
the&s;e Things had a more then ordinary Influence
upon the Minds of the common People, and they
had almo&s;t univer&s;al melancholly Apprehen&s;ions
of &s;ome dreadful Calamity and Judgment com|ing
upon the City; and this principally from
the Sight of this Comet, and the little Allarm
that was given in <HI>December,</HI> by two People dying
at St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s as above.</P>
<P>The Apprehen&s;ions of the People, were like|wi&s;e
&s;trangely encreas'd by the Error of the
Times; in which, I think, the People, from what
Principle I cannot imagine, were more adicted
to Prophe&s;ies, and A&s;trological Conjurations,
Dreams, and old Wives Tales, than ever they
were before or &s;ince: Whether this unhappy
Temper was originally rai&s;ed by the Follies of
&s;ome People who got Money by it; that is to &s;ay,
by printing Predictions, and Progno&s;tications I
know not; but certain it is, Book's frighted them
terribly; &s;uch as <HI>Lilly</HI>'s Almanack, <HI>Gadbury</HI>'s A|logical
Predictions; Poor <HI>Robin</HI>'s Almanack and
the like; al&s;o &s;everal pretended religious Books;
one entituled, <HI>Come out of her my People, lea&s;t you
be partaker of her Plagues;</HI> another call'd, Fair Warn|ing;
another, <HI>Britains</HI> Remembrancer, and many
&s;uch; all, or mo&s;t Part of which, foretold direct|ly
or covertly the Ruin of the City: Nay, &s;ome
<PB N="26" REF="28">
were &s;o Enthu&s;ia&s;tically bold, as to run about the
Streets, with their Oral Predictions, pretending
they were &s;ent to preach to the City; and One
in particular, who, like <HI>Jonah</HI> to <HI>Nenevah,</HI> cry'd
in the Streets, <HI>yet forty Days, and LONDON
&s;hall be de&s;troy'd.</HI> I will not be po&s;itive, whether
he &s;aid yet forty Days, or yet a few Days. Ano|ther
run about Naked, except a pair of Drawers
about his Wa&s;te, crying Day and Night; like a
Man that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> mentions, who cry'd, woe to
<HI>Jeru&s;alem!</HI> a little before the De&s;truction of that
City: So this poor naked Creature cry'd, <HI>O! the
Great, and the Dreadful God!</HI> and &s;aid no more,
but repeated tho&s;e Words continually, with a
Voice and Countenance full of horror, a &s;wift
Pace, and no Body cou'd ever find him to &s;top,
or re&s;t, or take any Su&s;tenance, at lea&s;t, that ever
I cou'd hear of. I met this poor Creature &s;eve|ral
Times in the Streets, and would have &s;poke
to him, but he would not enter into Speech with
me, or any one el&s;e; but held on his di&s;mal Cries
continually.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things terrified the People to the la&s;t
Degree; and e&s;pecially when two or three Times,
as I have mentioned already, they found one or
two in the Bills, dead of the Plague at St. <HI>Giles.</HI></P>
<P>Next to the&s;e publick Things, were the Dreams
of old Women: Or, I &s;hould &s;ay, the Interpre|tation
of old Women upon other Peoples Dreams;
and the&s;e put abundance of People even out of
their Wits: Some heard Voices warning them to
be gone, for that there would be &s;uch a Plague
in <HI>London,</HI> &s;o that the Living would not be able
to bury the Dead: Others &s;aw Apparitions in
the Air; and I mu&s;t be allow'd to &s;ay of both, I
hope with out breach of Charity, that they heard
Voices that never &s;pake, and &s;aw Sights that ne|ver
appear'd; but the Imagination of the People
<PB N="27" REF="29">
was really turn'd wayward and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd: And no
Wonder, if they, who were poreing continually
at the Clouds, &s;aw Shapes and Figures, Repre|&s;entations
and Appearances, which had nothing
in them, but Air and Vapour. Here they told
us, they &s;aw a Flaming-Sword held in a Hand,
coming out of a Cloud, with a Point hanging
directly over the City. There they &s;aw Her&s;es,
and Coffins in the Air, carrying to be buried.
And there again, Heaps of dead Bodies lying un|buried,
and the like; ju&s;t as the Imagination of
the poor terrify'd People furni&s;h'd them with Mat|ter
to work upon.</P>
<Q><L>So Hypocondriac Fancy's repre&s;ent</L>
<L>Ships, Armies, Battles, in the Firmament;</L>
<L>Till &s;teady Eyes, the Exhalations &s;olve,</L>
<L>And all to its fir&s;t Matter, Cloud, re&s;olve.</L></Q>
<P>I could fill this Account with the &s;trange Rela|tions,
&s;uch People gave every Day, of what they
had &s;een; and every one was &s;o po&s;itive of their
having &s;een, what they pretended to &s;ee, that
there was no contradicting them, without Breach
of Friend&s;hip, or being accounted rude and un|mannerly
on the one Hand, and prophane and im|penetrable
on the other. One time before the
Plague was begun, (otherwi&s;e than as I have &s;aid
in St. <HI>Giles,</HI>'s) I think it was in <HI>March,</HI> &s;eeing a
Crowd of People in the Street, I join'd with them
to &s;atisfy my Curio&s;ity, and found them all &s;taring
up into the Air, to &s;ee what a Woman told them
appeared plain to her, which was an Angel cloth'd
in white, with a fiery Sword in his Hand, waving
it, or brandi&s;hing it over his Head. She de&s;crib|ed
every Part of the Figure to the Life; &s;hew'd
them the Motion, and the Form; and the poor
People came into it &s;o eagerly, and with &s;o much
<PB N="28" REF="30">
Readine&s;s; YES, <HI>I &s;ee it all plainly,</HI> &s;ays one.
<HI>There's the Sword as plain as can be.</HI> Another &s;aw
the Angel. One &s;aw his very Face, and cry'd
out, What a glorious Creature he was! One &s;aw
one thing, and one another. I look'd as earne&s;tly
as the re&s;t, but, perhaps, not with &s;o much Wil|lingne&s;s
to be impos'd upon; and I &s;aid indeed,
that <HI>I could &s;ee nothing,</HI> but a white Cloud, bright
on one Side, by the &s;hining of the Sun upon the
other Part. The Woman endeavour'd to &s;hew it
me, but could not make me confe&s;s, that I &s;aw it,
which, indeed, if I had, I mu&s;t have lied: But
the Woman turning upon me, look'd in my Face,
aud fancied I laugh'd in which her Imagination
deceiv'd her too; for I really did not laugh, but
was very &s;eriou&s;ly reflecting how the poor People
were terrify'd, by the Force of their own Imagina|tion.
However, &s;he turned from me, call'd me
prophane Fellow, and a Scoffer; told me, that it
was a time of God's Anger, and dreadful Judg|ments
were approaching; and that De&s;pi&s;ers, &s;uch
as I, &s;hould <HI>wonder and peri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The People about her &s;eem'd di&s;gu&s;ted as well
as &s;he; and I found there was no per&s;wading
them, that I did not laugh at them; and that I
&s;hould be rather mobb'd by them, than be able
to undeceive them. So I left them; and this Ap|pearance
pa&s;s'd for as real, as rhe Blazing Star
it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Another Encounter I had in the open Day al&s;o:
And this was in going thro' a narrow Pa&s;&s;age
from <HI>Petty-France</HI> into <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate</HI> Church Yard, by a
Row of Alms-Hou&s;es; there are two Church Yards
to <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate</HI> Church, or Pari&s;h; one we go over
to pa&s;s from the Place call'd <HI>Petty-France</HI> into <HI>Bi|&s;hop&s;gate</HI>
Street, coming out ju&s;t by the Church Door,
the other is on the &s;ide of the narrow Pa&s;&s;age,
where the Alms-Hou&s;es are on the left; and a
<PB N="29" REF="31">
Dwarf-wall with a Pali&s;adoe on it, on the right
Hand; and the City Wall on the other Side, more
to the right.</P>
<P>In this narrow Pa&s;&s;age &s;tands a Man looking
thro' between the Pali&s;adoe's into the Burying
Place; and as many People as the Narrowne&s;s of
the Pa&s;&s;age would admit to &s;top, without hindring
the Pa&s;&s;age of others; and he was talking mighty
eagerly to them, and pointing now to one Place,
then to another, and affirming, that he &s;aw a
Gho&s;t walking upon &s;uch a Grave Stone there;
he de&s;crib'd the Shape, the Po&s;ture, and the Move|ment
of it &s;o exactly, that it was the greate&s;t Mat|ter
of Amazement to him in the World, that every
Body did not &s;ee it as well as he. On a &s;udden
he would cry, <HI>There it is: Now it comes this Way:</HI>
Then, '<HI>Tis turn'd back;</HI> till at length he per&s;uaded
the People into &s;o firm a Belief of it, that one fan|cied
he &s;aw it, and another fancied he &s;aw it;
and thus he came every Day making a &s;trange
Hubbub, con&s;idering it was in &s;o narrow a Pa&s;|&s;age,
till <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate</HI> Clock &s;truck eleven; and then
the Gho&s;t would &s;eem to &s;tart; and as if he were
call'd away, di&s;appear'd on a &s;udden.</P>
<P>I look'd earne&s;tly every way, and at the very
Moment, that this Man directed, but could not
&s;ee the lea&s;t Appearance of any thing; but &s;o po|&s;itive
was this poor man, that he gave the People
the Vapours in abundance, and &s;ent them a|way
trembling, and frighted; till at length, few
People, that knew of it, car'd to go thro' that
Pa&s;&s;age; and hardly any Body by Night, on any
Account whatever.</P>
<P>This Gho&s;t, as the poor Man afiirm'd, made
Signs to the Hou&s;es, and to the Ground, and to
the People, plainly intimating, or el&s;e they &s;o un|der&s;tanding
it, that Abundance of the People,
&s;hould come to be buried in that Church-Yard;
<PB N="30" REF="32">
as indeed happen'd: But that he &s;aw &s;uch A&s;|pects,
I mu&s;t acknowledg, I never believ'd; nor
could I &s;ee any thing of it my &s;elf, tho' I look'd
mo&s;t earne&s;tly to &s;ee it, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The&s;e things &s;erve to &s;hew, how far the People
were really overcome with Delu&s;ions; and as
they had a Notion of the Approach of a Vi&s;ita|tion,
all their Predictions run upon a mo&s;t dread|ful
Plague, which &s;hould lay the whole City, and
even the Kingdom wa&s;te; and &s;hould de&s;troy al|mo&s;t
all the Nation, both Man and Bea&s;t.</P>
<P>To this, as I &s;aid before, the A&s;trologers added
Stories of the Conjunctions of Planets in a malig|nant
Manner, and with a mi&s;chievous Influence;
one of which Conjunctions was to happen, and
did happen, in <HI>October;</HI> and the other in <HI>Novem|ber;</HI>
and they filled the Peoples Heads with Pre|dictions
on the&s;e Signs of the Heavens, intimat|ing,
that tho&s;e Conjunctions fortold Drought, Fa|mine,
and Pe&s;tilence; in the two fir&s;t of them how|ever,
they were entirely mi&s;taken, For we had no
droughty Sea&s;on, but in the beginning of the Year,
a hard Fro&s;t, which la&s;ted from <HI>December</HI> almo&s;t
to <HI>March;</HI> and after that moderate Weather, rather
warm than hot, with refre&s;hing Winds, and in
&s;hort, very &s;ea&s;onable Weather; and al&s;o &s;everal
very great Rains.</P>
<P>Some Endeavors were u&s;ed to &s;uppre&s;s the
Printing of &s;uch Books as terrify'd the People,
and to frighten the di&s;per&s;er$ of them, &s;ome of
whom were taken up, but nothing was done in
it, as I am inform'd; The Government being un|willing
to exa&s;perate the People, who were, <HI>as I
may &s;ay,</HI> all out of their Wits already.</P>
<P>Neither can I acquit tho&s;e Mini&s;ters, that
in their Sermons, rather &s;unk, than lifted up the
Hearts of their Hearers; many of them no doubt
did it for the &s;trengthning the Re&s;olution of the
<PB N="31" REF="33">
People; and e&s;pecially for quickning them to Re|pentance;
but it certainly an&s;wer'd not their End,
at lea&s;t not in Proportion to the injury it did ano|ther
Way; and indeed, as God him&s;elf thro' the
whole Scriptures, rather draws to him by Invitati|ons,
and calls to turn to him and live, than drives
us by Terror and Amazement; So I mu&s;t confe&s;s,
I thought the Mini&s;ters &s;hould have done al&s;o,
imitating our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Ma&s;ter in this, that
his whole Go&s;pel, is full of Declarations from
Heaven of Gods Mercy, and his readine&s;s to re|ceive
Penitents, and forgive them; complaining,
<HI>ye will not come unto me, that ye may have Life;</HI>
and that therefore, his Go&s;pel is called the Go&s;pel
of Peace, and the Go&s;pel of Grace.</P>
<P>But we had &s;ome good Men, and that of all
Per&s;ua&s;ions and Opinions, who&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es were
full of Torror; who &s;poke nothing but di&s;mal
Things; and as they brought the People together
with a kind of Horror, &s;ent them away in Tears,
prophe&s;ying nothing but evil Tidings; terrifying
the People with the Apprehen&s;ions of being utter|ly
de&s;troy'd, not guiding them, at lea&s;t not enough,
to Cry to Heaven for Mercy.</P>
<P>It was indeed, a Time of very unhappy Breaches
among us in matters of Religion: Innumerable
Sects, and Divi&s;ions, and &s;eperate Opinions pre|vail'd
among the People; the Church of <HI>England</HI>
was re&s;tor'd indeed with the Re&s;toration of the
Monarchy, about four Year before; but the Mi|ni&s;ters
and Preachers of the Presbyterians, and
Independants, and of all the other Sorts of Pro|fe&s;&s;ions,
had begun to gather &s;eperate Societies,
and erect Altar again&s;t Altar, and all tho&s;e had
their Meetings for Wor&s;hip apart, as they have
but not &s;o many then, the Di&s;&s;enters being not
thorowly form'd into a Body as they are &s;ince, and
tho&s;e Congregations which were thus gather'd to|gether,
<PB N="32" REF="34">
were yet but few; and even tho&s;e that
were, the Government did not allow, but endea|vour'd
to &s;uppre&s;s them, and &s;hut up their Meet|ings.</P>
<P>But the Vi&s;itation reconcil'd them again, at
lea&s;t for a Time, and many of the be&s;t and mo&s;t
valuable Mini&s;ters and Preachers of the Di&s;&s;en|ters,
were &s;uffer'd to go into the Churches, where
the Incumbents were fled away, as many were, not
being able to &s;tand it; and the People flockt with|out
Di&s;tinction to hear them preach, not much in|quiring
who or what Opinion they were of: But
after the Sickne&s;s was over, that Spirit of Charity
abated, and every Church being again &s;upply'd
with their own Mini&s;ters, or others pre&s;ented,
where the Mini&s;ter was dead, Things return'd to
their old Channel again.</P>
<P>One Mi&s;chief always introduces another: The&s;e
Terrors and Apprehen&s;ions of the People, led
them into a Thou&s;and weak, fooli&s;h, and wicked
Things, which, they wanted not a Sort of People
really wicked, to encourage them to; and this
was running about to Fortune tellers, Cunning-men,
and A&s;trologers, to know their Fortune, or, as
'tis vulgarly expre&s;s'd, to have their Fortunes told
them, their Nativities calculated, and the like;
and this Folly, pre&s;ently made the Town &s;warm
with a wicked Generation of Pretenders to Ma|gick,
to the <HI>Black Art, as they call'd it,</HI> and I know
not what; Nay, to a Thou&s;and wor&s;e Dealings
with the Devil, than they were really guilty of; and
this Trade grew &s;o open, and &s;o generally practi|&s;ed,
that it became common to have Signs and
In&s;criptions &s;et up at Doors; here lives a For|tune-teller;
here lives an A&s;trologer; here you
may have your Nativity calculated, and the like;
and Fryar <HI>Bacons</HI>'s Brazen-Head, which was the
u&s;ual Sign of the&s;e Peoples Dwellings, was to be
<PB N="33" REF="35">
&s;een almo&s;t in every Street, or el&s;e the Sign of Mo|ther
<HI>Shipton,</HI> or of <HI>Merlin</HI>'s Head, and the like.</P>
<P>With what blind, ab&s;urd, and ridiculous Stuff,
the&s;e Oracles of the Devil pleas'd and &s;atisfy'd
the People, I really know not; but certain it is,
that innumerable Attendants crouded about their
Doors every Day; and if but a grave Fellow in
a Velvet Jacket, a Band, and a black Cloak, which
was the Habit tho&s;e Quack Conjurers generally
went in, was but &s;een in the Streets, the People
would follow them, in Crowds and ask them Que|&s;tions,
as they went along.</P>
<P>I need not mention, what a horrid Delu&s;ion
this was, or what it tended to; but there was
no Remedy for it, till the Plague it &s;elf put an
End to it all; and I &s;uppo&s;e, clear'd the Town of
mo&s;t of tho&s;e Calculators them&s;elves. One Mi&s;|chief
was, that if the poor People ask'd the&s;e mock
A&s;trologers, whether there would be a Plague, or
no? they all agreed in the general to an&s;wer, <HI>Yes,</HI>
for that kept up their Trade; and had the People
not been kept in a Fright about that, the Wizards
would pre&s;ently have been rendred u&s;e$e&s;s, and their
Craft had been at an end: But they always talked
to them of &s;uch and &s;uch Influences of the Stars,
of the Conjunctions of &s;uch and &s;uch Plane$s,
which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily bring Sickne&s;$ and Di&s;tem|pers,
and con&s;equently the Plague: And &s;$me had
the A&s;&s;urance to tell them, the Plague was begun
already, which was too true, tho' they that &s;aid &s;o,
knew nothing of the Matter.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters, to do them J$&s;tice, and Preachers
of mo&s;t Sorts, that were &s;erious and under&s;tanding
Per&s;ons, thundred again&s;t the&s;e, and other $icked
Practi&s;es, and expo&s;ed the Folly as well as the Wick|edne&s;s
of them together; And the mo&s;t &s;ober and
judicious People de&s;pis'd and ab$or'd them: But
$t was impo&s;&s;ible to make any Impre&s;&s;ion upon the
<PB N="34" REF="36">
midling People, and the working labouring Poor;
their Fears were predominant over all their Pa&s;|&s;ions;
and they threw away their Money in a mo&s;t
di&s;tracted Manner upon tho&s;e Whym&s;ies. Maid-Ser|vants
e&s;pecially and Men-Servants, were the chief
of their Cu&s;tomers; and their Que&s;tion generally
was, after the fir&s;t demand of, <HI>Will there be a Plague?</HI>
I &s;ay, the next Que&s;tion was, <HI>Oh, Sir! For the Lord's
Sake, what will become of me? Will my Mi&s;tre&s;s keep me,
or will &s;he turn me off? Will &s;he &s;tay here, or will &s;he go
into the Country? And if &s;he goes into the Country, will
&s;he take me with her, or leave me here to be &s;tarv'd and
undone.</HI> And the like of Men-Servants.</P>
<P>The Truth is, the Ca&s;e of poor Servants was
very di&s;mal, as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention a|gain
by and by; for it was apparent, a prodigious
Number of them would be turn'd away, and it was
&s;o; and of them abundance peri&s;hed; and particu|ly
of tho&s;e that the&s;e fal&s;e Prophets had flattered
with Hopes, that they &s;hould be continued in their
Services, and carried with their Ma&s;ters and Mi|&s;tre&s;&s;es
into the Country; and had not publick
Charity provided for the&s;e poor Creatures, who&s;e
Number was exceeding great, and in all Ca&s;es of
this Nature mu&s;t be &s;o, they would have been in
the wor&s;t Condition of any People in the City.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things agitated the minds of the com|mon
People for many Months, while the fir&s;t Ap|prehen&s;ions,
were upon them; and while the Plague,
was not, as I may &s;ay, yet broken out: But I mu&s;t
al&s;o not forget, that the more &s;erious Part of the
Inhabitants behav'd after another Manner: The
Government encouraged their Devotion, and ap|pointed
publick Prayers, and Days of fa&s;ting and
Humiliation, to make publick Confe&s;&s;ion of Sin,
and implore the Mercy of God, to avert the dread|ful
Judgment, which hung over their Heads; and
it is not to be expre&s;s'd with what Alacrity the
<PB N="35" REF="37">
People of all per&s;ua&s;ions enbraced the Occa&s;ion;
how they flock'd to the Churches and Meetings,
and they were all &s;o throng'd, that there was often
no coming near, no, not to the very Doors of the
large&s;t Churches; Al&s;o there were daily Prayers ap|pointed
Morning and Evening at &s;everal Churches,
and Days of private praying at other Places; at
all which the People attended, I &s;ay, with an un|common
Devotion: Several private Families al&s;o,
as well of one Opinion as of another, kept Fa|mily
Fa&s;ts, to which they admitted their near Re|lations
only: So that in a Word, tho&s;e People, who
were really &s;erious and religious, apply'd them|&s;elves
in a truly Chri&s;tian Manner, to the proper
Work of Repentance and Humiliation, as a Chri|&s;tian
People ought to do.</P>
<P>Again the publick &s;hew'd, that they would
bear their Share in the&s;e Things; the very Court,
which was then Gay and Luxurious, put on a
Face of ju&s;t Concern, for the publick Danger:
All the Plays and Interludes, which after the Man|ner
of the <HI>French</HI> Court, had been &s;et up, and be|gan
to encrea&s;e among us, were forbid to Act;
the gaming Tables, publick dancing Rooms, and
Mu&s;ic Hou&s;es which multiply'd, and began to de|bauch
the Manners of the People, were &s;hut up
and &s;uppre&s;s'd; and the Jack-puddings, Merry-andrews,
Puppet-&s;hows, Rope-dancers, and &s;uch
like doings, which had bewitch'd the poor common
People, &s;hut up their Shops, finding indeed no
Trade; for the Minds of the People, were agitated
with other Things; and a kind of Sadne&s;s and
Horror at the&s;e Things, &s;at upon the Countenances,
even of the common People; Death was before
their Eyes, and every Body began to think of their
Graves, not of Mirth and Diver&s;ions.</P>
<P>But even tho&s;e whole&s;ome Reflections, which
rightly manag'd, would have mo&s;t happily led the
<PB N="36" REF="38">
people to fall upon their Knees, make Confe&s;&s;ion of
their Sins, and look up to their merciful Saviour
for Pardon, imploreing his Compa&s;&s;ion on them,
in &s;uch a Time of their Di&s;tre&s;s; by which, we
might have been as a &s;econd <HI>Nineveh,</HI> had a quite
contrary Extreme in the common People; who ig|norant
and &s;tupid in their Reflections, as they were
bruti&s;hly wicked and thoughtle&s;s before, were
now led by their Fright to extremes of Folly; and
as I have &s;aid before, that they ran to Conjurers
and Witches, and all Sorts of Decievers, to know
what &s;hould become of them; who fed their Fears,
and kept them always alarm'd, and awake, on
purpo&s;e to delude them, and pick their Pockets:
So, they were as mad, upon their running after
Quacks, and Mountebanks, and every practi&s;ing
old Woman, for Medicines and Remedies&punc; &s;tore|ing
them&s;elves with &s;uch Multitudes of Pills, Po|tions,
and Pre&s;ervatives, as they were call'd; that
they not only &s;pent their Money, but even poi&s;on'd
them&s;elves before-hand, for fear of the Poi&s;on of
the Infection, and prepar'd their Bodies for the
Plague, in&s;tead of pre&s;erving them again&s;t it. On
the other Hand, it is incredible, and &s;carce to be
imagin'd, how the Po&s;ts of Hou&s;es, and Corners
of Streets were pla&s;ter'd over with Doctors Bills,
and Papers of ignorant Fellows; quacking and
tampering in Phy&s;ick, and inviting the People to
come to them for Remedies; which was generally
&s;et off, with &s;uch flouri&s;hes as the&s;e, (<HI>viz.</HI>) IN|FALLIBLE
preventive Pills again&s;t the Plague&punc;
NEVER-FAILING Pre&s;ervatives again&s;t the
Infection. SOVERAIGN Cordials again&s;t
the Corruption of the Air. EXACT Regu|lations
for the Conduct of the Body, in Ca&s;e of
an Infection: Antipe&s;tilential Pills. INCOMPA|RABLE
Drink again&s;t the Plague, never found
<PB N="37" REF="39">
out before. An UNIVERSAL Remedy for
the Plague. The ONLY-TRUE Plague-Wa|ter.
The ROYAL-ANTIDOTE again&s;t
all Kinds of Infection; and &s;uch a Number more
that I cannot reckon up; and it I could, would
fi$ll a Book of them&s;elves to &s;et them down.</P>
<P>Others &s;et up Bills, to &s;ummons People to their
Lodgings for Directions and Advice in the Ca&s;e of
Infection: The&s;e had &s;pacious Titles al&s;o, &s;uch as
the&s;e.</P>
<Q><P>An eminent <HI>High-Dutch</HI> Phy&s;ician, newly come over
from <HI>Holland,</HI> where he re&s;ided during all the Time
of the great Plague, la&s;t Year, in <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> and
cured multitudes of People, that actually had the
Plague upon them.</P>
<P>An <HI>Italian</HI> Gentlewoman ju&s;t arrived from <HI>Naples,</HI>
having a choice Secret to prevent Infection, which
&s;he found out by her great Experience, and did won|derful
Cures with it in the late Plague there;
wherein there died 20000 in one Day.</P>
<P>An antient Gentlewoman having practi&s;ed, with great
Succe&s;s, in the late Plague in this City, <HI>Anno</HI> 1636,
gives her advice only to the Female Sex. To be
&s;poke with, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>An experienc'd Phy&s;ician, who has long &s;tudied the
the Doctrine of Antidotes again&s;t all Sorts of Poi|&s;on
and Infection, has after 40 Years Practi&s;e, ar|rived
to &s;uch Skill, as may, with God's Ble&s;&s;ing,
direct Per&s;ons how to prevent their being touch'd
by any Contagious Di&s;temper what&s;oever. He di|rects
the Poor <HI>gratis.</HI></P></Q>
<P>I take notice of the&s;e by way of Specimen: I
could give you two or three Dozen of the like, and
yet have abundance left behind. 'Tis &s;ufficient
from the&s;e to appri&s;e any one, of the Humour of
<PB N="38" REF="40">
tho&s;e Times; and how a Set of Thieves and Pick-pockets,
not only robb'd and cheated the poor Peo|ple
of their Money, but poi&s;oned their Bodies
with odious and fatal preparations; &s;ome with
Mercury, and &s;ome with other things as $ad, per|fectly
remote from the Thing pretended to; and
rather hurtful than &s;ervicable to the Body in ca&s;e
an Infection followed.</P>
<P>I cannot omit a Subtilty of one of tho&s;e Quack-operators,
with which he gull'd the poor People
to croud about him, but did nothing for them with|out
Money. He had it &s;eems, added to his Bills,
which he gave about the Streets, this Adverti&s;e|ment
in Capital Letters, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>He gives Advice to
the Poor for nothing.</HI></P>
<P>Abundance of poor People came to him according|ly,
to whom he made a great many fine Speeches;
examin'd them of the State of their Health, and
of the Con&s;titution of their Bodies, and told them
many good things for them to do, which were of no
great Moment: But the I&s;&s;ue and Conclu&s;ion of all
was, that he had a preparation, which if they
took &s;uch a Quantity of, every Morning, he would
pawn his Life, they &s;hould never have the Plague,
no, tho' they lived in the Hou&s;e with People that
were infected: This made the People all re&s;olve
to have it; But then the Price of that was <HI>&s;o much,</HI>
I think 'twas half-a-Crown: But, Sir, &s;ays one poor
Woman, I am a poor Alms-Woman, and am kept by
the Pari&s;h, and your Bills &s;ay, you give the Poor
your help for nothing. Ay, good Woman, &s;ays
the Docter, &s;o I do, as I publi&s;h'd there. I give
my Advice to the Poor for nothing; but not my
Phy&s;ick. Alas, Sir! &s;ays &s;he, that is a Snare laid
for the Poor then; for you give them your Ad|vice
for nothing, that is to &s;ay, you advi&s;e them
gratis, to buy your Phy&s;ick for their Money; &s;o
<PB N="39" REF="41">
does every Shop-keeper with his Wares. Here the
Woman began to give him ill Words, and &s;tood at
his Door all that Day, telling her Tale to all the
People that came, till the Doctor finding &s;he turn'd
away his Cu&s;tomers; was oblig'd to call her up
Stairs again, and give her his Box of Phy&s;ick for
nothing, which, perhaps too was <HI>good for nothing
when &s;he had it.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the people, who&s;e Confu&s;ions
fitted them to be impos'd upon by all Sorts of
Pretenders, and by every Mountebank. There is
no doubt, but the&s;e quacking Sort of Fehows rais'd
great gains out of the mi&s;erable People; for we
daily found, the Crouds that ran after them were in|finitely
greater, and their Doors were more throng|ed
than tho&s;e of Dr. <HI>Brooks,</HI> Dr. <HI>Upton,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hodges,</HI>
Dr. <HI>Berwick,</HI> or any, tho' the mo&s;t famous Men of
the Time: And I was told, that &s;ome of them got
five Pound a Day by their Phy&s;ick.</P>
<P>But there was &s;till another Madne&s;s beyond all
this, which may &s;erve to give an Idea of the di|&s;tracted
humour of the poor People at that Time;
and this was their following a wor&s;e Sort of
Deceivers than any of the&s;e; for the&s;e petty Thieves
only deluded them to pick their Pockets, and get
their Money; in which their Wickedne&s;s, <HI>whate|ver
it was,</HI> lay chiefly on the Side of the Decei|ver's
deceiving, not upon the Deceived: But in
this Part I am going to mention, it lay chiefly in
the People deceiv'd, or equally in both; and this
was in wearing Charms, Philters, Exorci&s;ms, A|mulets,
and I know not what Preparations, to for|tify
the Body with them again&s;t the Plague; as if
the Plague was not the Hand of God, but a kind
of a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an evil Spirit; and that it was to
be kept off with Cro&s;&s;ings, Signs of the Zodiac,
Papers tied up with &s;o many Knots; and certain
Words, or Figures written on them, as particular|ly
<PB N="40" REF="42">
the Word <HI>Abracadabra,</HI> form'd in Triangle, or
Pyramid, thus.</P>

<P>I might &s;pend a great deal of Time in my Ex|clamations
again&s;t the Follies, and indeed Wick|edne&s;s
of tho&s;e things, in a Time of &s;uch Danger,
in a matter of &s;uch Con&s;equences as this, of a
National Infection, But my Memorandums of the&s;e
things relate rather to take notice only of the Fact,
and mention that it was &s;o: How the poor People
found the In&s;ufficiency of tho&s;e things, and how
many of them were afterwards carried away in
the Dead Carts, and thrown into the common
Graves of every Pari&s;h, with the&s;e helli&s;h Charms
and Trumpery hanging about their Necks, re|mains
to be &s;poken of as we go along.</P>
<P>All this was the Effect of the Hurry the People
were in, after the fir&s;t Notion of the Plague be|ing
at hand was among them: And which may
be &s;aid to be from about <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1664, but
more particularly after the two Men died in St
<HI>Giles</HI>'s, $n the Beginning of <HI>December.</HI> And a|gai$,
after another Alarm in <HI>February;</HI> for when
the Plague ev$dently &s;pread it &s;elf, they &s;oon be|gan
to &s;ee the Folly of tra&s;ting to tho&s;e unper|forming
Creatures, who had Gull'd them of their
<PB N="41" REF="43">
Money, and then their Fears work'd another
way, namely, to Amazement and Stupidity, not
knowing what Cour&s;e to take, or what to do,
either to help or relieve them&s;elves; but they ran
about from one Neighbours Hou&s;e to another;
and even in the Streets, from one Door to another
with repeated Cries, of, <HI>Lord have Mercy upon us,
what &s;hall we do?</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, the poor People were to be pity'd in one
particular Thing, in which they had little or no
Re$ief, and which I De&s;ire to mention with a &s;eri|ous
Awe and Reflection; which perhaps, every
one that reads this, may not reli&s;h: Namely, that
whereas Death now began not, <HI>as we may &s;ay,</HI> to
hover over every ones Head only, but to look in|to
their Hou&s;es, and Chambers, and &s;tare in their
Faces: Tho' there might be &s;ome &s;tupidity, and
du$$ne&s;s of the Mind, and there was &s;o, a great
deal; yet, there was a great deal of ju&s;t Alarm,
&s;ounded into the very inmo&s;t Soul, <HI>if I may &s;o &s;ay</HI>
of others: Many Con&s;ciences were awakened;
many hard Hearts melted into Tears; many a peni|tent
Confe&s;&s;ion was made of Crimes long concealed:
would wound the Souls of any Chri&s;tian, to have
heard the dying Groans of many a de&s;pairing Crea|ture,
and none dur&s;t come near to comfort them:
Many a Robbery, many a Murder, was then con|fe&s;t
aloud, and no Body &s;urviving to Record the
Accounts of it. People might be heard even into the
Streets as we pa&s;s'd along, calling upon God for Mer|cy,
thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>and &s;aying,</HI> I have been a Thief,
I have been an Adulterer, I have been a Murderer,
and the like; and none dur&s;t &s;top to make the lea&s;t
Inquiry into &s;uch Things, or to admini&s;ter Com|fort
to the poor Creatures, that in the Angui&s;h both
of Soul and Body thus cry'd out. Some of the
Mini&s;ters did Vi&s;it the Sick at fir&s;t, and for a lit|tle
while, but it was not to be done; it would
<PB N="42" REF="44">
have been pre&s;ent Death, to have gone into &s;ome
Hou&s;es: The very buryers of the Dead, who were
the hardnede&s;t Creatures in Town, were &s;ome|times
beaten back, and &s;o terrify'd, that they dur&s;t
not go into Hou&s;es, where the whole Families were
&s;wept away together, and where the Circum&s;tan|ces
were more particularly horrible as &s;ome were;
but this was indeed, at the fir&s;t Heat of the Di|&s;temper.</P>
<P>Time enur'd them to it all; and they ventured
every where afterwards, without He&s;itation, as I
Occa&s;ion to mention at large hereafter.</P>
<P>I am &s;uppo&s;ing now, the Plague to be begun, as
I have &s;aid, and that the Magi&s;trates begun to
take the Condition of the People, into their &s;erious
Con&s;ideration; what they did as to the Regula|tion
of the Inhabitants, and of infected Families.
I &s;hall &s;peak to by it &s;elf; but as to the Affair
of Health, it is proper to mention it here, that
having &s;een the fooll&s;h Humour of the People, in
running after Quacks, and Mountebanks, Wizards,
and Fortune tellers, which they did as above, even
to Madne&s;s. The Lord Mayor, a very &s;ober and
religious Gentleman appointed Phy&s;icians and Sur|geons
for Relief of the poor; I mean, the di&s;ea&s;|ed
poor; and in particular, order'd the College of
Phy&s;icians to publi&s;h Directions for cheap Reme|dies,
for the Poor, in all the Circum&s;tances of the
Di&s;temper. This indeed was one of the mo&s;t
charitable and judicious Things that could be
done at that Time; for this drove the People from
haunting the Doors of every Di&s;per&s;er of Bills; and
from taking down blindly, and without Con&s;idera|tion,
Poi&s;on for Phy&s;ick, and Death in&s;tead of Life.</P>
<P>This Direction of the Phy&s;icians was done by
a Con&s;ultation of the whole College, and as it was
particularly calculated for the u&s;e of the Poor;
and for cheap Medicines it was made publick,
<PB N="43" REF="45">
&s;o that every Body might &s;ee it; and Copies
were given <HI>gratis</HI> to all that de&s;ired it: But as
it is publick, and to be &s;een on all Occa&s;ions, I
need not give the Reader of this, the Trouble
of it.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not be &s;uppo&s;ed to le&s;&s;en the Authority
or Capacity of the Phy&s;icians, when, I &s;ay, that
the Violence of the Di&s;temper, when it came to
its Extremity, was like the Fire the next Year;
The Fire which con&s;umed what the Plague could
not touch, defy'd all the Application of Remedies;
the Fire Engines were broken the Buckets thrown
away; and the Power of Man was baffled, and
brought to an End; &s;o the Plague defied all Medi|cince;
the very Phy&s;icians were &s;eized with it,
with their Pre&s;ervatives in their Mouths; and
Men went about pre&s;cribing to others and tel|ling
rhem what to do, till the Tokens were up|on
them, and they dropt down dead, de&s;troyed
by that very Enemy, they direc$$d others to op|po&s;e.
This was the Ca&s;e of &s;everal Phy&s;icians,
even &s;ome of them the mo&s;t eminent; and of
&s;everal of the mo&s;t skilful Surgeons; Abundance
of Quacks too died, who had the Folly to tru&s;t to
their own Medicines, which they mu&s;t needs
be con&s;cious to them&s;elves, were good for no|thing;
and who rather ought, like other Sorts
of Thieves, to have run away, &s;enfible of their
Guilt, from the Ju&s;tice that they could not
but expect &s;hould puni&s;h them, as they knew
they had de&s;erved.</P>
<P>Not that it is any Derogation from the La|bour,
or Application of the Phy&s;icans, to &s;ay, they
fell in the common Calamity; nor is it &s;o in|tended
by me; it rather is to their Prai&s;e, that
they ventured their Lives &s;o far as even to lo&s;e
them in the Service of Mankind; They endeavou|red
to do good, and to &s;ave the Lives of others; But
<PB N="44" REF="46">
we were not to expect, that the Phy&s;icians could
&s;top God's Judgments, or prevent a Di&s;temper
eminently arined from Heaven, from executing
the Errand it was &s;ent about,</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, the Phy&s;icians a&s;&s;i&s;ted many by their
Skill, and by their Prudence and Applications,
to the &s;aving of their Lives, and re&s;toring their
Health: But it is no le&s;&s;ening their Character, or
their Skill, to &s;ay, they could not cure tho&s;e that
had the Tokens upon them, or tho&s;e who were
mortally infected before the Phy&s;icians were &s;ent
for, as was frequently the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It remains to mention now what publick
Mea&s;ures were taken by the Magi&s;trates for the
general Safety, and to prevent the &s;preading
of the Di&s;temper, when it fir&s;t broke out: I
&s;hall have frequent Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of their
Prudence of the Magi&s;trates, their Charity, the
Vigilance for the Poor, and for pre&s;erving good
Order; furni&s;hing Provi&s;ions, and the like, when
the Plague was encrea&s;ed, as it afterwards was.
But I am now upon the Order and Regulations
they publi&s;hed for the Government of infected
Families.</P>
<P>I mention'd above &s;hutting of Hou&s;es up; and
it is needful to &s;ay &s;omething particularly to
that; for this Part of the Hi&s;tory of the Plague
is very melancholy; <HI>but the mo&s;t grievous Story
mu&s;t be told.</HI></P>
<P>About <HI>June</HI> the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> and
the Court of Aldermen, as I have &s;aid, began
more particularly to concern them&s;elves for the
Regulation of the City.</P>
<P>The Ju&s;tices of Peace for <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> by Directi|on
of the Secretary of State, had begun to &s;hut

be dead, the Plague cea&s;ed in tho&s;e Streets. It was
al&s;o ob&s;erv'd, that the Plague decreas'd &s;ooner in
tho&s;e Pari&s;hes, after they had been vi&s;ited to the

the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the

1665, when the Num$ers infected within the Ci|ty,
were but few, the la&s;t Bill for the 92 Pari&s;hes
being but four; and &s;ome Hou&s;es having been
&s;hut up in the City, and &s;ome &s;ick People being
removed to the Pe&s;t-Hou&s;e beyond <HI>Bunhill-Fields,</HI>
in the Way to $&s;lington; I &s;ay, by the&s;e Means,
when there died near one thou&s;and a Week in the

than any other Places all the Time of
the Infection.</P>
<P>The&s;e Orders of my Lord Mayor's were pub|li&s;h'd,

<P>&startq;WHEREAS in the Reign of our late

as unto them for the pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ity
&s;hould &s;eem good in their Di&s;cretions. It is now

<P>This &s;hutting up of hou&s;es was at fir&s;t counted
a very cruel and Unchri&s;tian Method, and the
poor People &s;o confin'd, made bitter Lamentations:
Complaints of the Severity of it, were al&s;o daily
brought to my Lord Mayor, of Hou&s;es cau&s;ele&s;sly,
(and &s;ome maliciou&s;ly) &s;hut up: I cannot &s;ay, but
upon Enquiry, many that complained &s;o loudly,
were found in a Condition to be continued, and
others again In&s;pection being made upon the &s;ick
Per&s;on, and the Sickne&s;s not appearing infections,
or if uncertain, yet, on his being content to
be carried to the Pe&s;t-Hou&s;e, were relea&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is true, that the locking up the Doors of
Peoples Hou&s;es, and &s;etting a Watchman there
Night and Day, to prevent their &s;tirring out, or
any coming to them; when, perhaps, the &s;ound
People, in the Family, might have e&s;caped, if
they had been remov'd from the Sick, looked ve|ry
hard and cruel; and many People peri&s;hed in
the&s;e mi&s;erable Confinements, which 'tis rea&s;on|able
<PB N="58" REF="60">
to believe, would not have been di&s;temper'd
if they had had Liberty, tho' the Plague was in the
Hou&s;e; at which the People were very clamorous
and unea&s;ie at fir&s;t, and &s;everal Violences were
committed, and Injuries offered to the Men, who
were &s;et to watch the Hou&s;es &s;o &s;hut up; al|&s;o
&s;everal People broke out by Force, in many
Places, as I &s;hall ob&s;erve by and by: But it was
a publick Good that ju&s;tified the private Mi&s;|chief;
a$d there was no obtaining the lea&s;t Miti|gation,
by a$y Application to Magi&s;trates, or Go|vernment,
at that Time, at lea&s;t, not that I heard
of. This put the People upon all Manner of Stra|tagem,
in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to get out, and it
would fill a little Volume, to &s;et down the Arts
us'd by the People of &s;uch Hou&s;es, to &s;hut the Eyes
of the Watchmen, who were employ'd, to deceive
them, $nd to e&s;cape, or break out from them; in
which frequent Scuffles, and &s;ome Mi&s;chief hap|pened;
of which by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>As I went along <HI>Hound&s;ditch</HI> one Morning, a|bout
eight a-Clock, there was a great Noi&s;e; it
is true indeed, there was not much Croud, be|cau&s;e
People were not very free to gather together,
or to &s;tay long together, when they were there,
nor did I &s;tay long there: But the Outcry was loud
enough to prompt my Curio&s;ity, and I call'd to
one that look'd out of a Window, and ask'd what
was the Matter.</P>
<P>A Watchman, it &s;eems, had been employed to
keep his Po&s;t at the Door of a Hou&s;e, which was
infected, or &s;aid to be infected, and was &s;hut up;
he had been there all Night for two Nights toge|ther,
as he told his Story, and the Day Watch|man
had been there one Day&punc; and was now come
to relieve him: All this while no Noi&s;e had
been heard in the Hou&s;e, no Light had been
&s;een; they call'd for nothing, &s;ent him of no Er|rands,
<PB N="59" REF="61">
which us'd to be the chief Bu&s;ine&s;s of the
Watchman; neither had they given him any Di|&s;turbance,
as he &s;aid, from the <HI>Monday</HI> afternoon,
when he heard great crying and &s;creaming in the
Hou&s;e, which, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, was occa&s;ioned by
&s;ome of the Family dying ju&s;t at that Time: it
&s;eems the Night before, the Dead-Cart, as it was
called, had been &s;topt there, and a Servant-Maid
had been brought down to the Door dead, and the
Buriers or Bearers, as they were call'd, put her in|to
the Cart, wrapt only in a green Rug, and
carried her away.</P>
<P>The Watchman had knock'd at the Door, it
&s;eems, when he heard that Noi&s;e and Crying, as
above, and no Body an&s;wered, a great while; but
at la&s;t one look'd out and &s;aid with an angry
quick Tone, and yet a Kind of crying Voice, or
a Voice of one that was crying, <HI>What d'ye want,
that ye make &s;uch a knocking?</HI> He an&s;wer'd, <HI>I am the
Watchman! $ow do you do? What is the Matter?</HI>
The Per&s;on an&s;wered, <HI>What is that to you? Stop the
Dead-Cart.</HI> This It &s;eems, was about one a-Clock;
&s;oon after, <HI>as the Fellow &s;aid,</HI> he &s;topped the Dead|Cart,
and then knock'd again, but no Body an|&s;wer'd:
He continued knocking, and the Bellman
call'd out &s;everal Times, <HI>Bring out your Dead;</HI> but
no Body an&s;wered, till the Man that drove the
Cart being call'd to other Ho$&s;es, would &s;tay no
longer, and drove away.</P>
<P>The Watchman knew not what to make of
all this, &s;o he let them alone, till the Morning-Man,
or Day Watchman, as they call'd him, came
to relieve him, giving him an Account of the
Particulars, they, knock'd at the Door a great
while, but no body an&s;wered; and they ob|&s;erv'd,
that the Window, or Ca&s;ement, at which
the Per&s;on had look'd out, who had an&s;wer'd be|fore,
continued open, being up two Pair of Stairs.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="62">
Upon this, the two Men to &s;atisfy their Curio|&s;ity,
got a long Ladder, and one of them went up
to the Window, and look'd into the Room, where
he &s;aw a Woman lying dead upon the Floor, in a
di&s;mal Manner, having no Cloaths on her but
her Shift: But tho' he call'd aloud, and putting
in his long Staff, knock'd hard on the Floor, yet
no Body &s;tirr'd or an&s;wered; neither could he
hear any Noi&s;e in the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He came down again, upon this, and acquaint|ed
his Fellow, who went up al&s;o, and finding
it ju&s;t &s;o, they re&s;olv'd, to acquaint either the
Lord Mayor, or &s;ome other Magi&s;trate of it, but
did not offer to go in at the Window: The Ma|gi&s;trate
it &s;eems, upon the Information of the
two Men, ordered the Hou&s;e to be broken open,
a Con&s;table, and other Per&s;ons being appointed
to be pre&s;ent, that nothing might be plundred;
and accordingly it was &s;o done, when no Body
was found in the Hou&s;e, but that young Woman,
who having been infected, and pa&s;t Recovery,
the re&s;t had left her to die by her &s;elf, and were
every one gone, having found &s;ome Way to de|lude
the Watchman, and get open the Door, or
get out at &s;ome Back Door, or over the Tops of the
Hou&s;es, &s;o that he knew nothing of it; and as to
tho&s;e Crys and Shrieks, which he heard, it was
&s;uppos'd, they were the pa&s;&s;ionate Cries of the
Family, at the bitter parting, which, to be &s;ure,
it was to them all; this being the Si&s;ter to the
Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Family. The Man of the Hou&s;e,
his Wife, &s;everal Children, and Servants, being
all gone and fled, whether &s;ick or &s;ound, that I
could never learn; nor, indeed, did I make much
Enquiry after it.</P>
<P>Many &s;uch e&s;capes were made, out of infected
Hou&s;es, as particularly, when the Watchman was
&s;ent of &s;ome Errand; for it was his Bu&s;ine&s;s to go
<PB N="61" REF="63">
of any Errand, that the Family &s;ent him of, that is
to &s;ay, for Nece&s;&s;aries, &s;uch as Food and Phy&s;ick;
to fetch Phy&s;icians, if they would come, or Sur|geons,
or Nur&s;es, or to order the Dead-Cart, and
the like; But with this Condition too, that when
he went, he was to lock up the Outer-Door of
the Hou&s;e, and take the Key away with him; to
evade this, and cheat the Watchmen, People got
two or three Keys made to their Locks; or they
found Ways to un&s;crew the Locks, &s;uch as were
&s;crew'd on, and &s;o take off the Lock, being in the
In&s;ide of the Hou&s;e, and while they &s;ent away
the Watchman to the Market, to the Bakehou&s;e,
or for one Trifle or another, open the Door, and
go out as often as they pleas'd: But this be|ing
found out, the Officers afterwards had Orders
to Padlock up the Doors on the Out&s;ide, and
place Bolts on them as they thought fit.</P>
<P>At another Hou&s;e, as I was inform'd, in the
Street next within <HI>Algate,</HI> a whole Family was
&s;hut up and lock'd in, becau&s;e the Maid-Servant
was taken &s;ick; the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e had com|plain'd
by his Friends to the next Alderman, and
to the Lord Mayor, and had con&s;ented to have
the Maid carried to the Pe&s;t-Hou&s;e, but was re|&s;u&s;ed,
&s;o the Door was marked with a red Cro&s;s,
a Padlo$k on the Out&s;ide, as above, and a Watch|man
&s;et to keep the Door according to publick
Order.</P>
<P>After the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e found there was
no Remedy, but that he, his Wife and his Chil|dren
were to be lockt up with this poor di&s;temper|ed
Servant; he call'd to the Watchman, and told
him, he mu&s;t go then and fetch a Nur&s;e for them,
to attend this poor Girl, for that it would be certain
Death to them all to oblige them to nur&s;e her,
and told him plainly, that if he would not do
this, the Maid mu&s;t peri&s;h either of the Di&s;tem|per,
<PB N="62" REF="64">
or be &s;tarv'd for want of Food; for he was
re&s;olv'd none of his Family, &s;hould go near her;
and $he lay in the Garret four Story high, where
&s;he could not Cry out, or call to any Body for
Help.</P>
<P>The Watchman con&s;ented to that, and went
and fetch'd a Nur&s;e as he was appointed, and
brought her to them the &s;ame Evening; during
this interval, the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e took his
Opportunity to break a large Hole thro' his Shop
into a Bulk or Stall, where formerly a Cobler had
&s;at, before or under his Shop-window; but the
Tenant as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, at &s;uch a di&s;mal
Time as that, was dead or remov'd, and &s;o he had
the Key in his own keeping; having made his
Way into this Stall, which he cou'd not have done,
if the Man had been at the Door, the Noi&s;e he
was obliged to make, being &s;uch as would have
alam'd the Watchman; I &s;ay, having made his
Way into this Stall, he &s;at &s;till till the Watchman
return'd with the Nur&s;e, and all the next Day al|&s;o;
but the Night following, having contriv'd to
&s;end the Watchman of another trifling Errand,
which as I take it, was to an Apothecary's for a
Pla&s;ter for the Maid, which he was to &s;tay for
the making up, or &s;ome other &s;uch Errand that
might &s;ecure his &s;taying &s;ome Time; in that
Time he conveyed him&s;elf, and all his Family out
of the Hou&s;e, and left the Nur&s;e and the Watch|man
to bury the poor Wench; that is, throw her
into the Cart, and take care of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I cou'd give a great many &s;uch Stories as the&s;e,
diverting enough, which in the long Cour&s;e of that
di&s;mal Year, I met with, <HI>that is</HI> heard of, and
which are very certain to be true, or very near the
Tuth; that is to &s;ay, true in the General, for
no Man could at &s;uch a Time, learn all the Par|ticulars:
There was likewi&s;e Violence u&s;ed with
<PB N="63" REF="65">
the Watchmen, <HI>as was reported</HI> in abundance of
Places; and I believe, that from the Beginning
of the Vi&s;itation to the End, there was not le&s;s
than eighteen or twenty of them kill'd, or &s;o
wounded as to be taken up for Dead, which was
&s;uppos'd to be done by the People in the infected
Hou&s;es which were &s;hut up, and where they at|tempted
to come out, and were oppos'd.</P>
<P>Nor indeed cou'd le&s;s be expected, for here were
ju&s;t &s;o many Pri&s;ons in the Town, as there were
Hou&s;es &s;hut up; and as the People &s;hut up or im|pri&s;on'd
&s;o, were guilty of no Crime, only &s;hut up
becau&s;e mi&s;erable, it was really the more intollera|ble
to them.</P>
<P>It had al&s;o this Difference; that every Pri&s;on,
as we may call it, had but one Jaylor; and as he
had the whole Hou&s;e to Guard, and that many
Hou&s;es were &s;o &s;ituated, as that they had &s;everal
Ways out, &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s, and &s;ome into &s;everal
Streets; it was impo&s;&s;ible for one Man &s;o to Guard
all the Pa&s;&s;ages, as to prevent the e&s;cape of Peo|ple,
made de&s;perate by the fright of their Circum|&s;tances,
by the Re&s;entment of their u&s;age, or by
the raging of the Di&s;temper it &s;elf; &s;o that they
would talk to the Watchman on one Side of the
Hou&s;e, while the Family made their e&s;cape at ano|ther.</P>
<P>For example, in <HI>Coleman-&s;treet,</HI> there are abun|dance
of Alleys, as appears &s;till; a Hou&s;e was &s;hut
up in that they call <HI>Whites</HI>-Alley, and this Hou&s;e
had a back Window, not a Door into a Court,
which had a Pa&s;&s;age into Bell-Alley; a Watch|man
was &s;et by the Con&s;table, at the Door of this
Hou&s;e, and there he &s;tood, or his Comrade Night
and Day, while the Family went all away in the
Evening, out at that Window into the Court,
and left the poor Fellows warding, and watching,
for near a Fortnight.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="66">
Not far from the &s;ame Place, they blow'd up
a Watchman with Gun-powder, and burnt the
poor Fellow dreadfully, and while he made hi|dious
Crys, and no Body would venture to come
near to help him; the whole Family that were able
to &s;tir, got out at the Windows one Story high; two
that were left Sick, calling out for Help; Care
was taken to give them Nur&s;es to look after them,
but the Per&s;ons fled were never found, till after
the Plague was abated they return'd, but as no|thing
cou'd be prov'd, &s;o nothing could be done
to them.</P>
<P>It is to be con&s;ider'd too, that as the&s;e were Pri&s;ons
without Barrs and Bolts, which our common Pri|&s;ons
are furni&s;h'd with, &s;o the People let them&s;elves
down out of their Windows, even in the Face of
the Watchman, bringing Swords or Pi&s;tols in their
Hands, and threatening the poor Wretch to &s;hoot
him, if he &s;tir'd, or call'd for Help.</P>
<P>In other Ca&s;es, &s;ome had Gardens, and Walls,
or Pales between them and their Neighbours; or
Yards, and back-Hou&s;es; and the&s;e by Friend|&s;hip
and Entreaties, would get leave to get over
tho&s;e Walls, or Pales, and &s;o go out at their
Neighbour's Doors; or by giving Money to their
Servants, get them, to let them thro' in the Night;
&s;o that in &s;hort, the &s;hutting up of Hou&s;es, was
in no wi&s;e to be depended upon; neither did it
an&s;wer the End at all; &s;erving more to make the
People de&s;perate, and drive them to &s;uch Extremi|ties,
as that, they would break out at all Adven|tures.</P>
<P>And that which was &s;till wor&s;e, tho&s;e that did
thus break out, &s;pread the Infection farther by their
wandring about with the Di&s;temper upon them,
in their de&s;perate Circum&s;tances, than they would
otherwi&s;e have done; for whoever con&s;iders all the
Particulars in &s;uch Ca&s;es mu&s;t acknowlede; a$d we
<PB N="65" REF="67">
cannot doubt but the &s;everity of tho&s;e Confine|ments,
made many People de&s;perate; and made
them run out of their Hou&s;es at all Hazards, and
with the Plague vi&s;ibly upon them, not knowing
either whither to go, or what to do, or indeed,
what they did; and many that did &s;o, were dri|ven
to dreadful Exigences and Extremeties, and
Peri&s;h'd in the Streets or Fields for meer Want, or
drop'd down, by the raging violence of the Fever
upon them: Others wandred into the Country,
and went forward any Way, as their De&s;peration
guided them, not knowing whether they went or
would go, till faint and tir'd, and not getting any
Relief; the Hou&s;es and Villages on the Road,
refu&s;ing to admit them to lodge, whether infected
or no; they have peri&s;h'd by the Road Side, or
gotten into Barns and dy'd there, none daring
to come tothem, or relieve them, tho' perhaps not
infected, for no Body would believe them.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, when the Plague at fir&s;t
&s;eiz'd a Family, that is to &s;ay, when any one Body
of the Family, had gone out, and unwarily or other|wi&s;e
catch'd the Di&s;temper and brought it Home,
it was certainly known by the Family, before it
was known to the Officers, who, as you will &s;ee
by the Order, were appointed to examine into
the Circum&s;tances of all &s;ick Per&s;ons, when they
heard of their being &s;ick.</P>
<P>In this Interval, between their being taken Sick,
and the Examiners coming, the Ma&s;ter of the
Hou&s;e had Lei&s;ure and Liberty to remove him&s;elf,
or all his Family, if he knew whether to go, and
many did &s;o: But the great di&s;$&s;ter was, that ma|ny
did thus, after they were really infected them|&s;elves,
and &s;o carry'd the Di&s;ea&s;e into the Hou&s;es
of tho&s;e who were &s;o Ho&s;pitable as to receive
them, which it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd was very cruel
and ungrateful.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="68">
And this was in Part, the Rea&s;on of the general
Notion, or &s;candal rather, which went about of
the Temper of People infected; Namely, that they
did not take the lea&s;t care, or make any Scruple of
infecting others; tho' I cannot &s;ay, but there
might be &s;ome Truth in it too, but not &s;o general
as was reported. What natural Rea&s;on could be
given, for &s;o wicked a Thing, at a Time, when
they might conclude them&s;elves ju&s;t going to ap|pear
at the Barr of Divine Ju&s;tice, I know not:
I am very well &s;atisfy'd, that it cannot be recon|cil'd
to Religion and Principle, any more than it
can be to Genero&s;ity and Humanity; but I may
&s;peak of that again.</P>
<P>I am &s;peaking now of People made de&s;perate,
by the Apprehen&s;ions of their being &s;hut up, and
their breaking out by Stratagem or Force, either
before or after they were &s;hut up, who&s;e Mi&s;ery
was not le&s;&s;en'd, when they were out, but &s;adly
encrea&s;ed: On the other Hand, many that thus
got away, had Retreats to go to, and other Hou|&s;es,
where they lock'd them&s;elves up, and kept
hid till the Plague was over; and many Fami|lies
fore&s;eeing the Approach of the Di&s;temper, laid
up Stores of Provi&s;ions, &s;ufficient for their whole
Families, and &s;hut them&s;elves up, and that &s;o entire|ly,
that they were neither &s;een or heard of, till the
Infection was quite cea&s;ed, and then came abroad
Sound and Well: I might recollect &s;everal &s;uch
as the&s;e, and give you the Particular of their
Management; for doubtle&s;s, it was the mo&s;t ef|fectual
&s;ecure Step that cou'd be taken for &s;uch,
who&s;e Circum&s;tance would not admit them to re|move,
or who had not Retreats abroad proper for
the Ca&s;e; for in being thus &s;hut up, they were as
if they had been a hundred Miles off: Nor do I
remember, that any one of tho&s;e Families mi&s;ca|ry'd;
among the&s;e, &s;everal <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants were

<P>But I come back to the Ca&s;e of Families infect|ed,
and &s;hut up by the Magi&s;trates; the Mi&s;ery
of tho&s;e Families is not to be expre&s;s'd, and it was
generally in &s;uch Hou&s;es that we heard the mo&s;t
di&s;mal Shrieks and Out-cries of the poor People
terrified, and even frighted to Death, by the Sight
of the Condition of their deare&s;t Relations, and by
the Terror of being impri&s;oned as they were.</P>
<P>I remember, and while I am writing this Sto|ry,
I think I hear the very Sound of it, a certain
Lady had an only Daughter, a young Maiden a|bout
19 Years old, and who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a ve|ry
Con&s;iderable Fortune; they were only Lod|gers
in the Hou&s;e where they were: The young
Woman, her Mother, and the $$aid, had been a|broad
on &s;ome Occa&s;ion, I do not remember what,
for the Hou&s;e was not &s;hut up; but about two
Hours after they came home, the young Lady
complain'd &s;he was not well; in a quarter of an
Hour more, &s;he vomited, and had a violent Pain in
her Head. Pray God, &s;ays her Mother in a terrible
Fright, my Child has not the Di&s;temper! The
Pain in her Head increa&s;ing, her Mother ordered
the Bed to be warm'd, and re&s;olved to put her to
Bed; and prepared to give her things to &s;weat,
which was the ordinary Remedy to be taken,
when the fir&s;t Apprehen&s;ions of the Diftemper
began.</P>
<P>While the Bed was airing, the Mother undre&s;|&s;ed
the young Woman, and ju&s;t as &s;he was laid
down in the Bed, &s;he looking upon her Body with
a Candle, immediately di&s;covered the fatal To|kens
on the In&s;ide of her Thighs. Her Mother
<PB N="68" REF="70">
not being able to contain her&s;elf, threw down
her Candle, and &s;criekt out in &s;uch a frightful
Manner, that it was enough to place Horror upon
the &s;toute&s;t Heart in the World; nor was it one
Skream, or one Cry, but the Fright&punc; having &s;eiz'd
her Spirits, &s;he fainted fir&s;t, then recovered, then
ran all over the Hou&s;e, up the Stairs and down the
Stairs, like one di&s;tracted, and indeed really was
di&s;tracted, and continued &s;creching and crying
out for &s;everal Hours, void of all Sen&s;e, or at lea&s;t,
Government of her Sen&s;es, and as I was told, ne|ver
came throughly to her&s;elf again: As to the
young Maiden, &s;he was a dead Corp&s;e from that
Moment; for the Gangren which occa&s;ions the
Spots had &s;pread her whole Body, and &s;he died
in le&s;s than two Hours: But &s;till the Mother
continued crying out, not knowing any Thing
more of her Child, &s;everal Hours after &s;he was
dead. It is &s;o $word$ ago, that I am not certain,
but I think the $$$her never recover'd, but died
in two or three Weeks after.</P>
<P>This was a$ extraordinary Ca&s;e, and I am there|fore
the more particular in it, becau&s;e I came &s;o
much to the Knowledge of it; but there were in|numerable
&s;uch like Ca&s;es; and it was &s;eldom,
that the Weekly Bill came in, but there were
two or three put in <HI>frighted,</HI> that is, <HI>that may well
be call'd,</HI> frighted to Death: But be&s;ides tho&s;e,
who were &s;o frighted to die upon the Spot, there
were great Numbers frighted to other Extreams,
&s;ome frighted out of their Sen&s;es, &s;ome out of their
Memory&punc; and &s;ome out of their Under&s;tanding:
But I return to the &s;hutting up of Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>As &s;everal People, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> got out of their Hou&s;es
by Stratagem, after they were &s;hut up, &s;o others
got out by bribing the Watchmen, and giving
them Money to let them go privately out in the
Night. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I thought it at that time,
<PB N="69" REF="71">
the mo&s;t innocent Corruption, or Bribery&punc; that a|ny
Man could be guilty of; and therefore could
not but pity the poor Men, and think it was hard
when three of tho&s;e Watchmen, were publickly
whipt thro' the Streets, for &s;uffering People to go
out of Hou&s;es &s;hut up.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding that Severity, Money pre|vail'd
with the poor Men, and many Families
found Means to make Salleys out, and e&s;cape that
way after they had been &s;hut up; but the&s;e were
generally &s;uch as had &s;ome Places to retreat to; and
tho' there was no ea&s;ie pa&s;&s;ing the Roads any whi|ther,
after the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> yet there were many
Ways of retreat, and particularly, as I hinted, &s;ome
got Tents and &s;et them up in the Fields, carrying
Beds, or Straw to lie on, and Provi&s;ions to eat, and
&s;o liv'd in them as Hermits in a Cell; for no Body
would venture to come near them; and &s;everal
Stories were told of &s;uch; &s;ome comical&punc; &s;ome tra|gical,
&s;ome who liv'd like wandring Pilgrims in
the De&s;arts, and e&s;caped by making them&s;elves
Exiles in &s;uch a Manner as is &s;carce to be credit|ed,
and who yet enjoyed more Liberty than was
to be expected in &s;uch Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>I have by me a Story of two Brothers and their
Kin&s;man, who being &s;ingle Men, but that had
&s;tay'd in the City too long to get away, and
indeed, not knowing where to go to have any Re|treat,
nor having wherewith to travel far, took
a Cour&s;e for their own Pre&s;ervation, which, tho'
in it &s;elf at fir&s;t, de&s;perate, yet was &s;o natural,
that it may be wondied, that no more did &s;o at
that Time. They were but of mean Condition,
and yet not &s;o very poor, as that they could not
furni&s;h them&s;elves with &s;ome little Convenien|cies,
&s;uch as might &s;erve to keep Life and Soul
together; and finding the Di&s;temper increa&s;ing
<PB N="70" REF="72">
in a terrible Manner, they re&s;olved to &s;hift, as
well as they could, and to be gone.</P>
<P>One of them had been a Soldier in the late
Wars, and before that in the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and
having been bred to no particular Employment
but his Arms; and be&s;ides being wounded, and
not able to work very hard, had for &s;ome Time
been employ'd at a Baker's of Sea Bisket <HI>in
Wapping.</HI></P>
<P>The Brother of this Man was a Seaman too, but
&s;ome how or other, had been hurt of one Leg,
that he could not go to Sea, but had work'd for
his Living at a Sail Makers in <HI>Wapping,</HI> or there
abouts; and being a good Husband, had laid up
&s;ome Money, and was the riche&s;t of the Three.</P>
<P>The third Man was a Joiner or Carpenter by
Trade, a handy Fellow; and he had no Wealth,
but his Box, or Basket of Tools, with the Help
of which he could at any Time get his Living,
&s;uch a Time as this excepted, wherever he went,
and he liv'd near <HI>Shadwel.</HI></P>
<P>They all liv'd in <HI>Stepney</HI> Pari&s;h, which, as I
have &s;aid, being the la&s;t that was infected, or at
lea&s;t violently, they &s;tay'd there till they evi|dently
&s;aw the Plague was abating at the We&s;t
Part of the Town, and coming towards the Ea&s;t
where they liv'd.</P>
<P>The Story of tho&s;e three Men, if the Reader
will be content to have me give it in their own
Per&s;ons, without taking upon me to either vouch
the Particulars, or an&s;wer for any Mi&s;takes. I &s;$all
give as di&s;tinctly as I can, believing the Hi&s;tory
will be a very good Pattern for any poor Man to
follow, in ca&s;e the like Publick De&s;olation &s;hould
happen here; and if there may be no &s;uch Occa|&s;ion,
which God of his infinite Mercy grant us, &s;till
the Story may have its U&s;es &s;o many Ways as that
it will, I hope, never be &s;aid, that the relating has
been unprofitable.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="73">
I &s;ay all this previous to the Hi&s;tory, having
yet, for the pre&s;ent, much more to &s;ay before I
quit my own Part.</P>
<P>I went all the fir&s;t Part of the Time freely about
the Streets, tho' not &s;o freely as to run my &s;elf
into apparent Danger, except when they dug the
great Pit in the Church-Yard of our Pari&s;h of <HI>Al|gate;</HI>
a terrible Pit it was, and I could not re&s;i&s;t
my Curio&s;ity to go and &s;ee it; as near as I may
judge, it was about 40 Foot in Length, and abo$t
15 or 16 Foot broad; and at the Time I fir&s;t look|ed
at it, about nine Foot deep; but it was &s;aid,
they dug it near 20 Foot deep afterwards, in one
Part of it, till they could go no deeper for the Wa|ter:
for they had it &s;eems, dug &s;everal large Pits
before this, for tho' the Plague was long a-com|ing
to our Pari&s;h, yet when it did come, there was
no Par&s;h in or about <HI>London,</HI> where it raged with
&s;uch Violence as in the two Pari&s;hes of <HI>Algate</HI> and
<HI>White Chapel.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ay they had dug &s;everal Pits in another Ground,
when the Di&s;temper began to &s;pread in our Pari&s;h,
and e&s;pecially when the Dead-Carts began to go
about, which, was not in our Pari&s;h, till the be|ginning
of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> Into the&s;e Pits they had put
perhaps 50 or 60 Bodies each, then they made
larger Holes, wherein they buried all that the
Cart brought in a Week, which by the middle, to
the End of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> came to, from 200 to 400 a
Week; and they could not well dig them larger,
becau&s;e of the Order of the Magi&s;trates, confining
them to leave no Bodies within &s;ix Foot of the
Surface; and the Water coming on, at about 17
or 18 Foo$, they could not well, I &s;ay, put more
in one Pit; but now at the Beginning of <HI>September,</HI>
the Plague raging in a dreadful Manner, and the
Number of Burials in our Pari&s;h increa&s;ing to more
than was ever buried in any Pari&s;h about <HI>London,</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="74">
of no larger Extent, they ordered this dreadful
Gulph to be dug; for &s;uch it was rather than a Pit.</P>
<P>They had &s;uppo&s;ed this Pit would have &s;up|ply'd
them for a Mouth or more, when they dug
it, and &s;ome blam'd the Church Wardens for &s;uf|fering
&s;uch a frightful Thing, telling them they
were making Preparations to bury the whole Pa|ri&s;h,
and the like; but Time made it appear, the
Church-Wardens knew the Condition of the Pari&s;h
better than they did; for the Pit being fini&s;hed the
4th of <HI>September,</HI> I think, they began to bury in it
the 6th, and by the 20, which was ju&s;t two Weeks
they had thrown into it 1114 Bodies, when they
were obl$ged to fill it up, the Bodies being then
come to lie within &s;ix Foot of the Surface: I doubt
not but there may be &s;ome antient Per&s;ons alive in
the Pari$h, who can ju&s;tify the Fact of this, and are
able to &s;hew even in what Part of the Church-Yard,
the Pit lay, better than I can; the Mark
of it al&s;o was many Years to be &s;een in the Church-Yard
on the Surface lying in Length, Parallel with
the Pa&s;&s;age which goes by the We&s;t Wall of the
Church-Yard, out of <HI>Hound&s;ditch,</HI> and turns Ea&s;t
again into <HI>White-Chappel,</HI> coming out near the three
Nuns Inn.</P>
<P>It was about the 10th of <HI>September,</HI> that my Cu|rio&s;ity
led, or rather drove me to go and &s;ee this
Pit again, when there had been near 400 People
buried in it; and I was not content to &s;ee it in
the Day-time, as I had done before; for then there
would have been nothing to have been &s;een but
the loo&s;e Earth; for all the Bodies that were thrown
in, were immediately covered with Earth, by tho&s;e
they call'd the Buryers, which at other Times were
call'd Bea$ers; but I re&s;olv'd to go in the Night
and &s;ee &s;ome of them thrown in.</P>
<P>There was a &s;trict Order to prevent People com|ing
to tho&s;e Pits, and that was only to prevent
Infection: But after &s;ome Time, that Order was
<PB N="73" REF="75">
more nece&s;&s;ary, for People that were Infected, and
near their End, and dilirious al&s;o, would run to
tho&s;e Pits wrapt in Blankers, or Rugs, and throw
them&s;elves in, and as they &s;aid, bury them&s;elves: I
cannot &s;ay, that the Officers &s;uffered any willingly
to lie there; but I have heard, that in a great
Pit in <HI>Finsbury,</HI> in the Pari&s;h of <HI>Cripplegate,</HI> it lying
open then to the Fields; for it was not then wall'd
about, came and threw them&s;elves in, and ex|pired
there, before they threw any Earth upon
them; and that when they came to bury others,
and found them there, they were quite dead, tho'
not cold.</P>
<P>This may &s;erve a little to de&s;cribe the dreadful
Condition of that Day, tho' it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay
any Thing that is able to give a true Idea of it to
tho&s;e who did not &s;ee it, other than this; that it
was indeed <HI>very, very, very</HI> dreadful, and &s;uch as no
Tongue can expre&s;s.</P>
<P>I got Admittance into the Church-Yard by being
acquainted with the Sexton, who attended, who
tho' he did not refu&s;e me at all, yet earne&s;tly per|&s;waded
me not to go; telling me very &s;eriou&s;ly,
for he was a good religious and &s;en&s;ible Man, that
it was indeed, their Bu&s;ine&s;s and Duty to venture,
and to run all Hazards; and that in it they might
hope to be pre&s;erv'd; but that I had no apparent
Call to it, but my own Curio&s;ity, which he &s;aid,
he believ'd I would not pretend, was &s;ufficient to
ju&s;tify my running that Hazard. I told him I had
been pre&s;s'd in my Mind to go, and that perhaps
it might be an In&s;tructing Sight, that might not
be without its U&s;es. Nay, &s;ays the good Man,
if you will venture upon that Score, '<HI>Name of God
go in;</HI> for depend upon it, 'twill be a Sermon to
you, it may be, the be&s;t that ever you heard in
your Life. 'Tis a &s;peaking Sight, &s;ays he, and
has a Voice with it, and a loud one, to call us all
to Repentance; and with that he opened the Door
and &s;aid, Go, if you will.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76">
His Di&s;cour&s;e had &s;hock'd my Re&s;olution a lit|tle,
and I &s;tood wavering for a good while; but
ju&s;t at that Interval I &s;aw two Links come over
from the End of the <HI>Minories,</HI> and heard the Bell|man,
and then appear'd a Dead-Cart, <HI>as they call'd
it,</HI> coming over the Streets &s;o I could no long|er
re&s;i&s;t my De&s;ire of &s;eeing it, and went in:
There was no Body, as I could perceive at fir&s;t,
in the Church-Yard, or going into it, but the
Buryers, and the Fellow that drove the Cart,
or rather led the Hor&s;e and Cart, but when
they came up, to the Pit, they &s;aw a Man go
to and again, mufled up in a brown Cloak, and
making Motions with his Hands, under his
Cloak, as if he was in a great Agony; and the Bu|riers
immediately gathered about him, &s;uppo&s;ing
he was one of tho&s;e poor dilirious, or de&s;perate
Creatures, that u&s;ed to pretend, as I have &s;aid, to
bury them&s;elves; he &s;aid nothing as he walk'd a|bout,
but two or three times groaned very deeply,
and loud, and &s;ighed as he would break his Heart.</P>
<P>When the Buryers came up to him they &s;oon found
he was neither a Per&s;on infected and de&s;perate, as
I have ob&s;erved above, or a Per&s;on di&s;temper|ed
in Mind, but one oppre&s;s'd with a dread|ful
Weight of Grief indeed, having his Wife and
&s;everal of his Children, all in the Cart, that was
ju&s;t come in with him, and he followed in an Ago|ny
and exce&s;s of Sorrow. He mourned heartily, as
it was ea&s;y to &s;ee, but with a kind of Ma&s;culine
Grief, that could not give it &s;elf Vent by Tears,
and calmly de&s;iring the Buriers to let him alone,
&s;aid he would only &s;ee the Bodies thrown in, and
go away, &s;o they left importuning him; but no &s;oon|er
was the Cart turned round, and the Bodies &s;hot
into the Pit promi&s;cuou&s;ly, which was a Surprize to
him, for he at lea&s;t expected they would have been
decently laid in, tho' indeed he was afterwards
<PB N="75" REF="77">
convinced that was impractible; I &s;ay, no &s;ooner
did he &s;ee the Sight, but he cry'd out aloud un|able
to contain him&s;elf; I could not hear what
he &s;aid, but he went backward two or three Steps,
and fell down in a Swoon: the Buryers ran to him
and took him up, and in a little While he came to
him&s;elf, and they led him away to the <HI>Pye Tavern</HI>
over-again&s;t the End of <HI>Hound&s;ditch,</HI> where, it &s;eems,
the Man was known, and where they took care of
him. He look'd into the Pit again, as he went a|way,
but the Butiers had covered the Bodies &s;o im|mediately
with throwing in Earth, that tho' there
was Light enough, for there were Lantherns and
Candles in them, plac'd all Night round the Sides
of the Pit, upon the Heaps of Earth, &s;even or
eight, or perhaps more, yet nothing could be
&s;een.</P>
<P>This was a mournful Scene indeed, and affected
me almo&s;t as much as the re&s;t; but the other was
awful, and full of Terror, the Cart had in it &s;ix|teen
or &s;eventeen Bodies, &s;ome were wrapt up in
Linen Sheets, &s;ome in Rugs, &s;ome little other than
naked, or &s;o loo&s;e, that what Covering they had,
fell from them, in the &s;hooting out of the Cart,
and they fell quite naked among the re&s;t; but the
Matter was not much to them, or the Indecency
much to any one el&s;e, &s;eeing they were all dead,
and were to be huddled together into the com|mon
Grave of Mankind, as we may call it, for here
was no Difference made, but Poor and Rich went
together; there was no other way of Burials, nei|ther
was it po&s;&s;ible there &s;hould, for Coffins were
not to be had for the prodigious Numbers that fell
in &s;uch a Calamity as this.</P>
<P>It was reported by way of Scandal upon the Bu|riers,
that if any Corp&s;e was delivered to them,
decently wound up as we call'd it then, in a Wind|ing
Sheet Ty'd over the Head and Feet, which
<PB N="76" REF="78">
&s;ome did, and which was generally of good Linen&punc;
I &s;ay, it was reported, that the Buriers were &s;o
wicked as to &s;trip them in the Cart, and carry
them quite naked to the Ground: But as I can not
ea&s;ily credit any thing &s;o vile among Chri&s;tians,
and at a Time &s;o fill'd with Terrors, as that was,
I can only relate it and leave it undetermined.</P>
<P>Innumerable Stories al&s;o went about of the cruel
Behaviours and Practi&s;es of Nur&s;es, who tended the
Sick, and of their ha&s;tening on the Fate of tho&s;e
they tended in their Sickne&s;s: But I &s;hall &s;ay more
of this in its Place.</P>
<P>I was indeed &s;hock'd with this Sight, it almo&s;t
overwhelm'd me, and I went away with my Heart
mo&s;t afflicted and full of the afflicting Thoughts,
&s;uch as I cannot de&s;cribe; ju&s;t at my going out of
the Church, and turning up the Street towards my
own Hou&s;e, I &s;aw another Cart with Links, and
a Bellman going before, coming out of <HI>Harrow-Alley,</HI>
in the <HI>Butcher-Row,</HI> on the other Side of the
Way, and being, as I perceived, very full of dead
Bodies, it went directly over the Street al&s;o toward
the Church: I &s;tood a while, but I had no Sto|mach
to go back again to &s;ee the &s;ame di&s;mal
Scene over again, &s;o I went directly Home, where
I could not but con&s;ider with Thankfulne&s;s, the
Ri&s;que I had run, believing I had gotten no In|jury;
as indeed I had not.</P>
<P>Here the poor unhappy Gentleman's Grief came
into my head again, and indeed I could not but
&s;hed Tears in the Reflection upon it, perhaps mo$e
than he did him&s;elf; but his Ca&s;e lay &s;o heavy
upon my Mind, that I could not prevail with my
&s;elf, but that I mu&s;t go out again into the Street,
and go to the <HI>Pye-Taver$,</HI> re&s;olving to enquir$
what became of him.</P>
<P>It was by this Time one a-Clock in the Morn|ing,
and yet the poor Gentleman was there; the
<PB N="77" REF="79">
Truth was, the People of the Hou&s;e knowing him,
had entertain'd him, and kept him there all the
Night, notwith&s;tanding the Danger of being infe|cted,
by him, tho' it appear'd the Man was per|fectly
&s;ound h$m&s;elf.</P>
<P>It is with Regret, that I take Notice of this
Tavern; the People were civil, mannerly, and an
obliging Sort of Folks enough, and had till this
Time kept their Hou&s;e open, and their Trade go|ing
on, tho' not &s;o very publickly as formerly; but
there was a dreadful Set of Fellows that u&s;ed their
Hou&s;e, and who in the middle of all this Horror
met there every Night, behaved with all the Re|velling
and roaring extravagances, as is u&s;ual for
&s;uch People to do at other Times, and indeed to
&s;uch an offen&s;ive Degree, that the very Ma&s;ter and
Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e grew fir&s;t a&s;ham'd and then
terrify'd at them.</P>
<P>They &s;at generally, in a Room next the Street,
and as they always kept late Hours, &s;o when the
Dead-Cart came cro&s;s the Street End to go into
<HI>Hounds-ditch,</HI> which was in View of the Tavern
Windows; they would frequently open the Win|dows
as &s;oon as they heard the Bell, and look out
at them; and as they might often hear &s;ad Lamen|tations
of People in the Streets, or at their Win|dows,
as the Carts went along, they would make
their inpudent Mocks and Jeers at them, e&s;pecially
if they heard the poor People call upon God to
have Mercy upon them, as many would do at tho&s;e
Times in their ordinary pa&s;&s;ing along the Streets.</P>
<P>The&s;e Gentlemen being &s;omething di&s;turb'd with
the Clutter of bringing the poor Gentleman into
the Hou&s;e, as above, were fir&s;t angry, and very
high with the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, for &s;uffering
&s;uch a Fellow, as they call'd him, to be brought
out of the Grave into their Hou&s;e; but being an|&s;wered,
that the Man was a Neighbour, and that
<PB N="78" REF="80">
he was &s;ound, but overwhelmed with the Cala|mity
of his Family, and the like, they turned their
Anger into ridiculing the Man, and his Sorrow for
his Wife and Children; taunted him with want
of Courage to leap into the great Pit, and go to
Heaven, as they jeetingly expre&s;s'd it, along with
them, adding &s;ome very profane, and even bla&s;phe|mous
Expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>They were at this vile Work when I came back
to the Hou&s;e, and as far as I could &s;ee, tho' the
Man &s;at &s;till, mute and di&s;con&s;olate, and their
Affronts could not divert his Sorrow, yet he was
both griev'd and offended at their Di&s;cour&s;e: Upon
this, I gently reprov'd them, being well enough ac|quainted
with their Characters, and not unknown
in Per&s;on to two of them.</P>
<P>They immediately fell upon me with ill Language
and Oaths; ask'd me what I did out of my Grave,
at &s;uch a Time when &s;o many <HI>hone&s;ter Men</HI> were
carried into the Church-Yard? and why I was not
at Home &s;aying my Prayers, again&s;t the Dead-Cart
came for me? and the like.</P>
<P>I was indeed a&s;toni&s;hed at the Impudence of the
Men, tho' not at all di&s;compo&s;ed at their Treat|ment
of me; however I kept my Temper; I told
them, that tho' I defy'd them, or any Man in the
World to tax me with any <HI>Di&s;hone&s;ty,</HI> yet I acknow|ledg'd,
that in this terrible Judgment of God, ma|ny
better than I was &s;wept away, and carried to
their Grave: But to an&s;wer their Que&s;tion directly,
the Ca&s;e was, that I was mercifully pre&s;erved by
that great God, who&s;e Name they had Bla&s;phem|ed
and taken in vain, by cur&s;ing and &s;wearing in a
dreadful Manner; and that I believed I was pre|&s;erv'd
in particular, among other Ends, of his
Goodne&s;s, that I might reprove them for their au|dacious
Boldne&s;s, in behaving in &s;ucha Manner, and
in &s;uch an awful Time as this was, e&s;pecially, for
<PB N="79" REF="81">
their Jeering and Mocking, at an hone&s;t Gentleman,
and a Neighbour, for &s;ome of them knew him, who
they &s;aw was overwhelm'd with Sorrow, for the
Breaches which it had pleas'd God to make upon
his Family.</P>
<P>I cannot call exactly to Mind the helli&s;h abomi|nable
Rallery, which was the Return they made to
that Talk of mine, being provoked, it &s;eems, that
I was not at all afraid to be free with them; nor if
I could remember, would I fill my Account with
any of the Words, the horrid Oaths, Cur&s;es and
vile Expre&s;&s;ions, &s;uch, as at that time of the Day,
even the wor&s;t and ordinarie&s;t People in the Street
would not u&s;e; (for except &s;uch hardened Crea|tures
as the&s;e, the mo&s;t wicked wretches that could
be found, had at that Time &s;ome Terror upon their
Minds of the Hand of that Power which could
thus, in a Moment de&s;troy them.)</P>
<P>But that which was the wor&s;t in all their devil|li&s;h
Language was, that they were not afraid to
bla&s;pheme God, and talk Athei&s;tically; making a
Je&s;t at my calling the Plague the Hand of God,
mocking, and even laughing at the Word Judgment,
as if the Providence of God had no Concern in the
inflicting &s;uch a de&s;olating Stroke; and that the
People calling upon God, as they &s;aw the Carts
carrying away the dead Bodies was all enthu&s;ia|&s;tick,
ab&s;urd, and impertinent.</P>
<P>I made them &s;ome Reply, &s;uch as I thought pro|per,
but which I found was &s;o far from putting
a Checq$e to their horrid Way of &s;peaking, that it
made them rail the more, &s;o that I confe&s;s it fill'd
me with Horror, and a kind of Rage, and I came
away, as I told them, le&s;t the Hand of that Judg|ment
which had vi&s;ited the whole City &s;hould glo|rify
his Vengeance upon them, and all that were
near them.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="82">
They received all Reproof with the utmo&s;t Con|tempt,
and made the greate&s;t Mockery that was po|&s;ible
for them to do at me, giving me all the op|probrious
in&s;olent Scoffs that they could think of for
preaching to them, <HI>as they call'd it,</HI> which indeed,
grieved me, rather than angred me; and I went a|way
ble&s;&s;ing God, however, in my Mind, that I had
not &s;par'd them, tho' they had in&s;ulted me &s;o much.</P>
<P>They continued this wretched Cour&s;e, three or
four Day after this, continua$y mocking and jeer|ing
at all that &s;hew'd them&s;elves religious, or &s;eri|ous,
or that were any way touch'd with the Sence
of the terrible Judgment of God upon us, and I was
inform'd they flouted in the &s;ame Manner, at the
good People, who, notwith&s;tanding the Contagion,
met at the Church, fa&s;ted, and prayed to God to
remove his Hand from them.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, they continued this dreadful Cour&s;e three
or four Days, <HI>I think it was no more,</HI> when one of
them, particularly he who ask'd the poor Gentle|man
<HI>what he did ou$ of his Grave?</HI> was &s;truck from
Heaven with the Plague, and died in a mo&s;t de|plorable
Manner; and in a Word they were every
one of them carried into the great Pit, which I
have mentioned above, before it was quite fill'd
up, which was not above a Fortnight or thereabout.</P>
<P>The&s;e Men were guilty o$ many extravagances,
&s;uch as one would think, Human Nature &s;hould
have trembled at the Though$s of, at &s;uch a Time
of general Terror, as was then upon us; and parti|ticularly
&s;coffing and mocking at every thing which
they happened to &s;ee, that was religious among
the People, e&s;pecially at their thronging zealou&s;ly
to the Place of publick Wor&s;hip, to implore Mercy
from Heaven in &s;uch a Time of Di&s;tre&s;s; and this
Tavern, where they held their Club, being within
View of the Church Door, they had the more par|ticular
Occa&s;ion for their Athei&s;tical profane Mirth.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83">
But this began to abate a little with them before
the Accident, which I have related, happened; for
the Infection increa&s;ed &s;o violently&punc; at this Part of the
Town now, that People began to be afraid to come
to the Church, at lea&s;t &s;uch Numbers did not re&s;ort
thither as was u&s;ual; many of the Clergymen likewi&s;e
were Dead&punc; and others gone into the Country; for it
really required a &s;teady Courage, and a &s;trong Faith,
for a Man not only to venture being in Town at &s;uch
a Time as this, but likewi&s;e to venture to come to
Church and perform the Office of a Mini&s;ter to a
Congregation, of whom he had rea&s;on to believe ma|ny
of them, were actually infected with the Plague&punc;
and to do this every Day, or twice a Day, as in &s;ome
Places was done.</P>
<P>It is true, the People &s;hew'd an extraordinary Zeal
in the&s;e religious Exerci&s;es, and as the Church Doors
were always open, People would go in &s;ingle at all
Times, whether the Mini&s;ter was officiating or no,
and locking them&s;elves into &s;eparate Pews, would be
praying to God with great Fervency and Devotion.</P>
<P>Others a&s;&s;embled at Meeting-Hou&s;es, every one as
their different Opinions in &s;uch Things guided, but all
were promi&s;cuou&s;ly the Subject of the&s;e Mens Drolle|ry,
e&s;pecially at the Beginning of the Vi&s;itation.</P>
<P>It &s;eems they had been check'd for their open in&s;ult|ing
Religion in this Manner, by &s;everal good People
of every per&s;wa&s;ion, and that, and the violent raging
of the Infection, I &s;uppo&s;e, was the Occa&s;ion that
they had abated much of their Rudene&s;s, for &s;ome
time before, and were only rous'd by the Spirit of Ri|baldry,
and Athei&s;m, at the Clamour which was made,
when the Gentleman was fir&s;t brought in there, and
perhaps, were agitated by the &s;ame Devil, when I
took upon me to reprove them; tho' I did it at fir&s;t
with all the Calmne&s;s, Temper, and Good-Manners
that I could, which, for a while, they in&s;ulted me
the more for, thinking it had been in fear of their Re|&s;entment,
tho' afterwards they found the contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="84">
I went Home indeed, griev'd and afflicted in my
Mind, at the Abominable Wickedne&s;s of tho&s;e Men
not doubting, however, that they would be made
dreadful Examples of God's Ju&s;tice; for I look'd up|this
di&s;mal Time to be a particular Sea&s;on of Divine
Vengeance, and that God would, on this Occa&s;ion,
&s;ingle out the proper Objects, of his Di&s;plea&s;ure, in a
more e&s;pecial and remarkable Manner, than at ano|ther
Time; and that, tho' I did believe that many good
People would, and did, fall in the common Calami|ty,
and that it was no certain Rule to judge of the
eternal State of any one, by their being di&s;tingui&s;h'd in
&s;uch a Time of general De&s;truction, neither one Way
or other; yet I &s;ay, it could not but &s;eem rea&s;onable
to believe, that God would not think fit to &s;pare by
his Mercy &s;uch open declared Enemies, that &s;hould
in&s;ult his Name and Being, defy his Vengeance, and
mock at his Wor$hip and Wor&s;hipers, at &s;uch a Time,
no not tho' his Mercy had thought fit to bear with,
and &s;pare them at other Times: That this was a Day
of Vi$itation; a Day of God's Anger; and tho&s;e
Words came into my Thought. <HI>J$r. v. 9. Shall I not
vi&s;it for the&s;e things, &s;aith the Lord, and &s;hall not my
Soul be avenged of &s;uch a Nation as this?</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Things, I &s;ay, lay upon my Mind; and I
went home very much griev'd and oppre&s;s'd with the
Horror of the&s;e Mens Wickedne&s;s, and to think that
any thing could be &s;o vile, &s;o hardened, and &s;o noto|riou&s;ly
wicked, as to in&s;ult God and his Servants,
and his Wor&s;hip, in &s;uch a Manner, and at &s;uch a
Time as this was; when he had, as it were, his Sword
drawn in his Hand, on purpo&s;e to take Vengeance,
not on them only, but on the whole Nation.</P>
<P>I had indeed, been in &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ion, at fir&s;t, with
them, tho' it was really rai&s;ed, not by any Affront
they had offered me per&s;onally, but by the Horror
the$r bla&s;pheming Tongues fi$$'d me with; however,
I was doubtful in my Thoughts, whether the Re&s;ent|ment
I retain'd was not all upon my own private Ac|count,
<PB N="83" REF="85">
for they had given me a great deal of ill Lan|guage
too&punc; I mean Per&s;onally; but after &s;ome Pau&s;e,
and having a Weight of Grief upon my Mind, I re|tir'd
my &s;elf, as &s;oon as I came home, for I &s;lept not
that Night, and giving God mo&s;t humble Thanks for
my Pre&s;ervation in the eminent Danger I had been in,
I &s;et my Mind &s;erioully, and with the utmo&s;t Earne&s;t|ne&s;s,
to pray for tho&s;e de&s;parate Wretches, that God
would pardon them, open their Eyes, and effectually
humble them.</P>
<P>By this I not only did my Duty, namely, to pray
for tho&s;e who di&s;pitefully u&s;ed me, but I fully try'd
my own Heart, to my full Satisfaction; that it was not
fill'd with any Spirit of Re&s;entment as they had of|ended
me in particular; and I humbly recommend
the Method to all tho&s;e that would know, or be cer|tain,
how to di&s;tingui&s;h between their real Zeal for
the Honour of God, and the Effects of their private
Pa&s;&s;ions and Re&s;entment.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t go back here to the particular Incidents
which occur to my Thoughts of the Time of the Vi|&s;itation,
and particularly, to the Time of their &s;hut|ting
up Hou&s;es, in the fir&s;t Part of the Sickne&s;s; for
before the Sickne&s;s was come to its Height, People
had more Room to make their Ob&s;ervations, than
they had afterward: But when it was in the Extre|mity,
there was no &s;uch Thing as Communication
with one another, as before.</P>
<P>During the &s;hutting up of Hou&s;es, as I have &s;aid,
&s;ome Violence was offered to the Watchmen; as to
Soldiers, there were none to be found; the few Guards
which the King then had, which were nothing like
the Number, entertain'd &s;ince, were di&s;per&s;s'd, either
at <HI>Oxford</HI> with the Court, or in Quarters in the re|moter
Parts of the Country; &s;mall detatchments ex|cepted,
who did Duty at the Tower, and at <HI>White-Hall,</HI>
and the&s;e but very few; neither am I po&s;itive,
that there was any other Guard at the Tower, than
the <HI>Warders,</HI> as they call'd them, who &s;tand at the
<PB N="84" REF="86">
Gate with Gowns and Caps, the &s;ame as the Yeomen
of the Guard; except the ordinary Gunners, who
were 24, and the Officers appointed to look after the
Magazine, who were call'd Armourers: as to Traind-Bands,
there was no Po&s;&s;ibility of rai&s;ing any, neither
if the Lieutenancy, either of <HI>London</HI> or <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> had
ordered the Drums to beat for the Militia, would
any of the Companies, I believe, have drawn to|gether,
whatever Ri&s;que they had run.</P>
<P>This made the Watchmen be the le&s;s regarded, and
perhaps, occa&s;ioned the greater Violence to be u&s;ed
again&s;t them; I mention it on this Score, to ob&s;erve
that the &s;etting Watchmen thus to keep the People in,
was (1&s;t) of all, not effectual, but that the People
broke out, whether by Force or by Stratagem, even
almo&s;t as often as they pleas'd: And (2d) that tho&s;e
that did thus break out, were generally People infect|ed,
who in their De&s;peration, running about from one
Place to another, valued not who they injur'd, and
which perhaps, as I have &s;aid, might give Birth to
Report, that it was natural to the infected People to
de&s;ire to infect others, which Report was really fal&s;e.</P>
<P>And I know it &s;o well, and in &s;o many &s;everal Ca&s;es,
that I could give &s;everal Relations of good, pious,
and religious People, who, when they have had the Di|&s;temper,
have been &s;o far from being forward to infect
others, that they have forbid their own Family to
come near them, in Hopes of their being pre&s;erved;
and have even died without &s;eeing their neare&s;t Re|lations,
le&s;t they &s;hould be in&s;trumental to give them
the Di&s;temper, and infect or endanger them: If then
there were Ca&s;es wherein the infected People were
carele&s;s of the Injury they did to others, this was cer|tainly
one of them, if not the chief, namely, when
People, who had the Di&s;temper, had broken out from
Hou&s;es which were &s;o &s;hut up, and having been driven
to Extremities for Provi&s;ion, or for Entertainment, had
endeavoured to conceal their Condition, and have been
thereby In&s;trumental involuntarily to infect others who
have been ignorant and unwary.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="87">
This is one of the Rea&s;ons why I believed them, and
do believe &s;till, that the &s;hutting up Hou&s;es thus by
Force, and re&s;training, or rather impri&s;oning People in
their own Hou&s;es, as is &s;aid above, was of little or no
Service in the Whole; nay, I am of Opinion, it was
rather hurtful, having forc'd tho&s;e de&s;perate People
to wander abroad with the Plague upon them, who
would otherwi&s;e have died quietly in their Beds.</P>
<P>I remember one Citizen, who having thus broken
out of his Hou&s;e in <HI>Alder&s;gate-Street,</HI> or thereabout,
went along the Road to <HI>I&s;lington,</HI> he attempted to have
gone in at the <HI>Angel-Inn,</HI> and after$that, at the <HI>White-Hor&s;e,</HI>
two Inns known &s;till by the &s;ame Signs, but
was refu&s;ed; after which he came to the <HI>Pyed Bull,</HI>
an Inn al&s;o &s;till continuing the &s;ame Sign; he asked
them for Lodging for one Night only, pretending to
be going into <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> and a&s;&s;uring them of his be|ing
very &s;ound, and free from the Infection, which al|&s;o,
at that Time, had not reached much that Way.</P>
<P>They told him they had no Lodging that they could
&s;pare, but one Bed, up in the Garret, and that they
could &s;pare that Bed but for one Night, &s;ome Drovers
being expected the next Day with Cattle; &s;o, if he
would accept of that Lodging, he might have it,
which he did; &s;o a Servant was &s;ent up with a Candle
with him, to &s;hew him the Room; he was very well
dre&s;s'd, and look'd like a Per&s;on not u&s;ed to lie in a
Garret, and when he came to the Room he fech'd a
deep Sigh, and &s;aid to the Servant, I have &s;eldom lain
in &s;uch a Lodging as this; however the Servant a&s;&s;ur|ing
him again, that they had no better. Well, &s;ays
he, I mu&s;t make &s;hift; this is a dreadful Time, but it
is but for one Night; &s;o he &s;at down upon the Bed|&s;ide,
and bad the maid, <HI>I think it was,</HI> fetch him up a
Pint of warm Ale; accordingly the Servant went for
the Ale; but &s;ome Hurry in the Hou&s;e, which per|haps,
employed her otherways, put it out of her
Head; and &s;he went up no more to him.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="88">
The next Morning &s;eeing no Appearance of the
Gentleman, &s;ome Body in the Hou&s;e asked the Ser|vant
that had &s;hewed him up Stairs, what was be|come
of him? She &s;tarted; Alas &s;ays &s;he, I never
thought more of him: He bad me carry him &s;ome
warm Ale, but I forgot; upon which, not the Maid,
but &s;ome other Per&s;on, was &s;ent up to &s;ee after him,
who coming into the Room found him &s;tark dead,
and almo&s;t cold, &s;tretch'd out cro&s;s the Bed; his
Cloths were pulled off, his Jaw fallen, his Eyes open
in a mo&s;t frightful Po&s;ture, the Rug of the Bed being
gra&s;ped hard in one of his Hands; &s;o that it was plain
he died &s;oon after the Maid left him, and 'tis proba|ble,
had &s;he gone up with the Ale, &s;he had found him
dead in a few Minutes after he &s;at down upon the
Bed. The Alarm was great in the Hou&s;e, as any
one may &s;uppo&s;e, they having been free from the Di|&s;temper,
till that Dia&s;ter, which bringing the Infe|ction
to the Hou&s;e, &s;pread it immediately to other
Hou&s;es round about it. I do not remember how ma|ny
died in the Hou&s;e it &s;elf, but I think the Maid
Servant, who went up fir&s;t with him, fell pre|&s;ently
ill by the Fright, and &s;everal others; for where|as
there died but two in <HI>I&s;lington</HI> of the Plague the
Week before, there died 17 the Week after, whereof
14 were of the Plague; this was in the Week from
the 11th of <HI>July</HI> to the 18th.</P>
<P>There was one Shift that &s;ome Families had, and
that not a few, when their Hou&s;es happened to be
infected, <HI>and that was this;</HI> The Families, who in the
fir&s;t breaking out of the Di&s;temper, fled away in|to
the Country, and had Retreats among their
Friends, generally found &s;ome or other of their Neigh|bours
or Relations to commit the Charge of tho&s;e
Hou&s;es to, for the Safety of the Goods, and the like.
Some Hou&s;es were indeed, entirely lock'd up, the
Doors padlockt, the Windows and Doors having
Deal-Boards nail'd over them, a$d only the In&s;pection
of them committed to the ordinary Watchmen and Pa|ri&s;h
Officers; but the&s;e were but few.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="89">
It was thought that there were not le&s;s than
10000 Hou&s;es for&s;aken of the Inhabitants in the
City and Suburbs, including what was in the Out
Pari&s;hes, and in Surrey, or the Side of the Water
they call'd <HI>Southwark.</HI> This was be&s;ides the Numbers
of Lodgers, and of particular Per&s;ons who were
fled out of other Families; &s;o that in all it was com|puted
that about 200000 People were fled and gone
in all: But of this I &s;hall &s;peak again: But I men|tion
it here on this Account, namely, that it was a
Rule with tho&s;e who had thus two Hou&s;es in their
Keeping, or Care, that if any Body was taken &s;ick in
a Family, before the Ma&s;ter of the Family let the
Examiners, or any other Officer, know of it, he im|mediately
would &s;end all the re&s;t of his Family whe|ther
Children or Servants, as it fell out to be, to &s;uch
other Hou&s;e which he had &s;o in Charge, and then
giving Notice of the &s;ick Per&s;on to the Examiner,
have a Nur&s;e, or Nur&s;es appointed; and have ano|ther
Per&s;on to be &s;hut up in the Hou&s;e with them
(which many for Money would do) &s;o to take
Charge of the Hou&s;e, in ca&s;e the Per&s;on &s;hould die.</P>
<P>This was in many Ca&s;es the &s;aving a whole Fa|mily,
who, if they had been &s;hut up with the &s;ick
Per&s;on, would inevitably have peri&s;hed: But on the
other Hand, this was another of the Inconveniencies
of &s;hutting up Hou&s;es; for the Apprehen&s;ions and
Terror of being &s;hut up, made many run away with
the re&s;t of the Family, who, tho' it was not publick|ly
known, and they were not quite &s;ick, had yet
the Di&s;temper upon them; and who by having an
uninterrupted Liberty to go about, but being oblig|ed
&s;till to conceal their Circum&s;tances, or perhaps
not knowing it them&s;elves, gave the Di&s;temper
to others, and &s;pread the Infection in a dreadful
Manner, as I &s;hall explain farther hereafter.</P>
<P>And here I may be able to make an Ob&s;ervation
or two of my own, which may be of u&s;e hereafter to
tho&s;e, into who&s;e Hands this may come, if they
&s;hould ever &s;ee the like dreadful Vi&s;itation. (1.) The
<PB N="88" REF="90">
Infection generally came into the Hou&s;es of the Ci|tizens,
by the Means of their Servants, who, they
were obliged to &s;end up and down the Streets for Ne|ce&s;&s;aries,
that is to &s;ay, for Food, or Phy&s;ick, to Bake-hou&s;es,
Brew-hou&s;es, Shops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and who going nece&s;|&s;arily
thro' the Streets into Shops, Markets, and the
like, it was impo&s;&s;ible, but that they &s;hould one way
or other, meet with di&s;tempered people, who con|veyed
the fatal Breath into them, and they brought
it Home to the Families, to which they belonged.
(2.) It was a great Mi&s;take, that &s;uch a great City
as this had but one Pe&s;t-Hou&s;e; for had there been,
in&s;tead of one Pe&s;t-Hou&s;e <HI>viz.</HI> beyond <HI>Bunhil-Fields,</HI>
where, at mo&s;t, they could receive, perhaps, 200 or
300 People; I &s;ay, had there in&s;tead of that one been
&s;everal Pe&s;t-hou&s;es, every one able to contain a thou|&s;and
People without lying two in a Bed, or two Beds
in a Room; and had every Ma&s;ter of a Family, as &s;oon
as any Servant e&s;pecially, had been taken &s;ick in his
Hou&s;e, been obliged to &s;end them to the next Pe&s;t-Hou&s;e,
if they were willing, as many were, and had
the Examiners done the like among the poor People,
when any had been &s;tricken with the Infection; I
&s;ay, had this been done where the People were wil|ling,
(not otherwi&s;e) and the Hou&s;es not been &s;hut,
I am per&s;waded, and was all the While of that Opi|nion,
that not &s;o many, by &s;everal Thou&s;ands, had
died; for it was ob&s;erved, and I could give &s;everal
In&s;tances within the Compa&s;s of my own Knowledge,
where a Servant had been taken &s;ick, and the Family
had either Time to &s;end them out, or retire from
the Hou&s;e, and leave the &s;ick Per&s;on, <HI>as I have &s;aid
above,</HI> they had all been pre&s;erved; whereas, when
upon one, or more, &s;ickning in a Family, the Hou&s;e
has been &s;hut up, the whole Family have peri&s;hed,
and the Bearers been oblig'd to go in to fetch out
the Dead Bodies, none being able to bring them to
the Door; and at la&s;t none left to do it.</P>
<P>(2.) This put it out of Que&s;tion to me, that the Cala|mity
<PB N="89" REF="91">
was &s;pread by Infection, that is to &s;ay, by &s;ome
certain Steams, or Fumes, which the Phy&s;icians call
<HI>Effluvia,</HI> by the Breath, or by the Sweat, or by the
Stench of the Sores of the &s;ick Per&s;ons, or &s;ome other
way, perhaps, beyond even the Reach of the Phy&s;i|cians
them&s;elves, which <HI>Effluvia</HI> affected the Sound,
who come within certain Di&s;tances of the Sick, im|mediately
penetrating the Vital Parts of the &s;aid
&s;ound Per&s;ons, putting their Blood into an immediate
ferment, and agitating their Spirits to that Degree
which it was found they were agitated; and &s;o tho&s;e
newly infected Per&s;ons communicated it in the &s;ame
Manner to others; and this I &s;hall give &s;ome In&s;tan|ces
of, that cannot but convince tho&s;e who &s;eriou&s;ly
con&s;ider it; and I cannot but with &s;ome Wonder,
find &s;ome People, now the Contagion is over, talk of
its being an immediate Stroke from Heaven, without
the Agency of Means, having Commi&s;&s;ion to &s;trike
this and that particular Per&s;on, and none other;
which I look upon with Contempt, as the Effect of
manife&s;t Ignorance and Enthu&s;ia&s;im; likewi&s;e the
Opinion of others, who talk of infection being car|ried
on by the Air only, by carrying with it va&s;t
Numbers of In&s;ects, and invi&s;ible Creatures, who en|ter
into the Body with the Breath, or even at the
Pores with the Air, and there generate, or emit mo&s;t
accute Poi&s;ons, or poi&s;onous Ovae, or Eggs, which
mingle them&s;elves with the Blood, and &s;o infect the
Body; a Di&s;cour&s;e full of learned Simplicity, and
manife&s;ted to be &s;o by univer&s;al Experience; but
I &s;hall &s;ay more to this Ca&s;e in its Order.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t here take farther Notice that Nothing was
more fatal to the Inhabitants of this City, than the
Supine Negligence of the People them&s;elves, who
during the long Notice, or Warning they had of the
Vi&s;itation, yet made no Provi&s;ion for it, by laying
in Store of Provi&s;ions, or of other Nece&s;&s;aries; by
which they might have liv'd retir'd, and within
their own Hou&s;es, as I have ob&s;erved, others did,
<PB N="90" REF="92">
and who were in a great Mea&s;ure pre&s;erv'd by that
Caution; nor were they, after they were a little
hardened to it &s;o &s;hye of conver&s;ing with one ano|ther,
when actually infected, as they were at fir&s;t,
no tho' they knew it.</P>
<P>I acknowledge I was one of tho&s;e thoughtle&s;s Ones,
that had made &s;o little Provi&s;ion, that my Servants
were obliged to go out of Doors to buy every Trifle
by Penny and Half-penny, ju&s;t as before it begun,
even till my Experience &s;hewing me the Folly, I
began to be wi&s;er &s;o late, that I had &s;carce Time to
&s;tore my &s;elf &s;ufficient for our common Sub&s;i&s;tence
for a Month.</P>
<P>I had in Family only an antient Woman, that
managed the Hou&s;e, a Maid-Servant, two Appren|tices,
and my &s;elf; and the Plague beginning to
encrea&s;e about us, I had many &s;ad Thoughts about
what Cour&s;e I &s;hould take, and how I &s;hould act;
the many di&s;mal Objects, which happened every|where
as I went about the Streets, had fill'd my
Mind with a great deal of Horror, for fear of the Di|&s;temper
it &s;elf, which was indeed, very horrible in
it &s;elf, and in &s;ome more than in others, the &s;wellings
which were generally in the Neck, or Groin, when
they grew hard, and would not break, grew &s;o pain|ful,
that it was equal to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Tor|ture;
and &s;ome not able to bear the Torment threw
them&s;elves out at Windows, or &s;hot them&s;elves, or
otherwi&s;e made them&s;elves away, and I &s;aw &s;everal
di&s;mal Objects of that Kind: Others unable to con|tain
them&s;elves, vented their Pain by ince&s;&s;ant
Roarings, and &s;uch loud and lamentable Cries were
to be heard as we walk'd along the Streets, that
would Pierce the very Heart to think of, e&s;pecially
when it was to be con&s;idered, that the &s;ame dread|ful
Scourge might be expected every Moment to
&s;eize upon our &s;elves.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay, but that now I began to faint in
in my Re&s;olutions, my Heart fail'd me very much,
<PB N="91" REF="93">
and &s;orely I repented of my Ra&s;hne&s;s: When I had
been out, and met with &s;uch terrible Things as the&s;e
I have talked of; I &s;ay, I repented my Ra&s;hne&s;s in
venturing to abide in Town: I wi&s;h'd often, that I
had not taken upon me to &s;tay, but had gone away
with my Brother and his Family.</P>
<P>Terrified by tho&s;e frightful Objects, I would retire
Home &s;ometimes, and re&s;olve to go out no more, and
perhaps, I would keep tho&s;e Re&s;olutions for three or
four Days, which Time I &s;pent in the mo&s;t &s;erious
Thankfulne&s;s for my Pre&s;ervation, and the Pre&s;er|vation
of my Family, and the con&s;tant Confe&s;&s;ion of
my Sins, giving my &s;elf up to God every Day, and
applying to him with Fa&s;ting, Humiliation, and
Meditation: Such intervals as I had, I employed in
reading Books, and in writing down my Memoran|dums
of what occurred to me every Day, and out of
which, afterwards, I for mo&s;t of this Work as it
relates to my Ob&s;ervations without Doors: What I
wrote of my private Meditations I re&s;erve for pri|vate
U&s;e, and de&s;ire it may not be made publick on
any Account whatever.</P>
<P>I al&s;o wrote other Meditations upon Divine Sub|jects,
&s;uch as occurred to me at that Time, and were
profitable to my &s;elf, but not fit for any other View,
and therefore I &s;ay no more of that.</P>
<P>I had a very good Friend, a Phy&s;ician, who&s;e
Name was <HI>Heath,</HI> who I frequently vi&s;ited during this
di&s;mal Time, and to who&s;e Advice I was very much
oblig'd for many Things which he directed me to
take, by way of preventing the Infection when I
went out, as he found I frequently did, and to hold
in my Mouth when I was in the Streets; he al&s;o
came very often to &s;ee me, and as he was a good
Chri&s;tian, as well as a good Phy&s;ician, his agreeable
Conver&s;ation was a very great Support to me in the
wor&s;t of this terribe Time.</P>
<P>It was now the Beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and the
Plague grew very violent and terrible in the Place
<PB N="92" REF="94">
where I liv'd, and Dr. <HI>Heath</HI> coming to vi&s;it me, and
finding that I ventured &s;o often out in the Streets,
earne&s;tly per&s;waded me to lock my &s;elf up and my
Family, and not to &s;uffer any of us to go out of
Doors; to keep all our Windows fa&s;t, Shutters and
Curtains clo&s;e, and never to open them; but fir&s;t.
to make a very &s;trong Smoke in the Room, where the
Window, or Door was to be opened, with Rozen and
Pitch, Brim&s;tone, or Gunpowder, and the like; and
we did this for &s;ome Time: But as I had not laid in
a Store of Provi&s;ion for &s;uch a retreat, it was impo&s;|&s;ible
that we could keep within Doors entirely;
however, I attempted, tho' it was &s;o very late, to
do &s;omething towards it; and fir&s;t, as I had Conve|nience
both for Brewing and Baking, I went and
bought two Sacks of Meal, and for &s;everal Weeks,
having an Oven, we baked all our own Bread; al&s;o I
bought Malt, and brew'd as much Beer as all the
Casks I had would hold, and which &s;eem'd enough
to &s;erve my Hou&s;e for five or &s;ix Weeks; al&s;o I laid in
a Quantity of Salt-butter and <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> Chee&s;e; but I
had no Fle&s;h-meat, and the Plague raged &s;o violent|ly
among the Butchers, and Slaughter-Hou&s;es, on
the other Side of our Street, where they are known
to dwell in great Numbers, that it was not advi&s;|able,
&s;o much as to go over the Street among them.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve again, that this Nece&s;&s;i|ty
of going out of our Hou&s;es to buy Provi&s;ions, was
in a great Mea&s;ure the Ruin of the whole City, for
the People catch'd the Di&s;temper, on tho&s;e Occa|&s;ions,
one of another, and even the Provi&s;ions them|&s;elves
were often tainted, at lea&s;t I have great Rea|&s;on
to believe &s;o; and therefore I cannot &s;ay with
Satisfaction what I know is repeated with great A&s;|&s;urance,
that the Market People, and &s;uch as brought
Provi&s;ions, to Town, were never infected: I am cer|tain,
the Butchers of <HI>White-Chapel</HI> where the greate&s;t
Part of the Fle&s;h-meat was killed, were dreadfully
vi&s;ited, and that at la&s;t to &s;uch a Degree, that few
<PB N="93" REF="95">
of their Shops were kept open, and tho&s;e that re|main'd
of them, kill'd their Meat at <HI>Mile-End,</HI> and
that Way, and brought it to Market upon Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>However, the poor People cou'd not lay up Provi|&s;ions,
and there was a nece&s;&s;ity, that they mu&s;t go
to Market to buy, and others to &s;end Servants or their
Children; and as this was a Nece&s;&s;ity which re|new'd
it &s;elf daily; it brought abundance of un|&s;ound
People to the Markets, and a great many
that went thither Sound, brought Death Home with
them.</P>
<P>It is true, People us'd all po&s;&s;ible Precaution,
when any one bought a Joint of Meat in the Market,
they would not take it of the Butchers Hand, but
take it off of the Hooks them&s;elves. On the other
Hand, the Butcher would not touch the Money,
but have it put into a Pot full of Vinegar which he
kept for that purpo&s;e. The Buyer carry'd always
&s;mall Money to make up any odd Sum, that they
might take no Change. They carry'd Bottles for
Scents, and Perfumes in their Hands, and all the
Means that could be us'd, were us'd: But then the
Poor cou'd not do even the&s;e things, and they went
at all Hazards.</P>
<P>Innumerable di&s;mal Stories we heard every Day
on this very Account: Sometimes a Man or Wo|man
dropt down Dead in the very Markets; for ma|ny
People that had the Plague upon them, knew no|thing
of it; till the inward Gangreen had affected
their Vitals and they dy'd in a few Moments;
this caus'd, that many died frequently in that Man|ner
in the Streets &s;uddainly, without any warning:
Others perhaps had Time to go to the next Bulk or
Stall; or to any Door, Porch, and ju&s;t &s;it down and
die, as I have &s;aid before.</P>
<P>The&s;e Objects were &s;o frequent in the Streets,
that when the Plague came to be very raging, On
one Side, there was &s;carce any pa&s;&s;ing by the Streets,
but that &s;everal dead Bodies would be lying here
<PB N="94" REF="96">
and there upon the Ground; on the other hand it is ob|&s;ervable,
that tho' at fir&s;t, the People would &s;top as they
went along, and call to the Neighbours to come out on
&s;uch an Occa&s;ion; yet, afterward, no Notice was ta|ken
of them; but that, if at any Time we found a Corps
lying, go cro&s;s the Way, and not come near it; or
if in a narrow Lane or Pa&s;&s;age, go back again, and
&s;eek &s;ome other Way to go on the Bu&s;ine&s;s we were
upon; and in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, the Corps was always left,
till the Officers had notice, to come and take them
away; or till Night, when the Bearers attending the
Dead-Cart would take them up, and carry them a|way:
Nor did tho&s;e undaunted Creatures, who per|formed
the&s;e Offices, fail to &s;earch their Pockets,
and &s;ometimes &s;trip off their Cloths, if they were
well dre&s;t, as &s;ometimes they were, and carry off
what they could get.</P>
<P>But to return to the Markets; the Butchers took
that Care, that if any Per&s;on dy'd in the Market, they
had the Officers always at Hand, to take them up
upon Hand-barrows, and carry them to the next
Church-Yard; and this was &s;o frequent that &s;uch
were not entred in the weekly Bill, found Dead in the
Streets or Fields, as is the Ca&s;e now; but they went
into the general Articles of the great Di&s;temper.</P>
<P>But now the Fury of the Di&s;temper encrea&s;ed to
&s;uch a Degree, that even the Markets were but very
thinly furni&s;hed with Provi&s;ions, or frequented with
Buyers, compair'd to what they were before; and
the Lord-Mayor cau&s;ed the Country-People who
brought Provi&s;ions, to be &s;top'd in the Streets lead|ing
into the Town, and to &s;it down there with their
Goods, where they &s;old what they brought, and
went immediately away; and this Encourag'd the
Country People greatly to do &s;o, for they &s;old their
Provi&s;ions at the very Entrances into the Town,
and even in the Fields; as particularly in the Fields
beyond <HI>White-Chappel,</HI> in <HI>Spittle-fields.</HI> Note, <HI>Tho&s;e
Streets now called</HI> Spittle-Fields, <HI>were then indeed open
<PB N="95" REF="97">
Fields:</HI> Al&s;o in St. <HI>George's-fields</HI> in <HI>Southwork,</HI> in <HI>Bun-Hill</HI>
Fields, and in a great Field, call'd <HI>Wood's-Clo&s;e</HI>
near <HI>I&s;lington;</HI> thither the Lord-Mayor, Aldermen,
and Magi&s;trates, &s;ent their Officers and Servants to
buy for their Families, them&s;elves keeping within
Doors as much as po&s;&s;ible; and the like did many
other People; and after this Method was taken, the
Country People came with great chearfulne&s;s, and
brought Provi&s;ions of all Sorts, and very &s;eldom got
any harm; which I &s;uppo&s;e, added al&s;o to that Re|port
of their being Miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>As for my little Family, having thus as I have
&s;aid, laid in a Store of Bread, Butter, Chee&s;e, and
Beer, I took my Friend and Phy&s;ician's Advice, and
lock'd my &s;elf up, and my Family, and re&s;olv'd to
&s;uffer the hard&s;hip of Living a few Mouths without
Fle&s;h-Meat, rather than to purcha&s;e it at the ha|zard
of our Lives.</P>
<P>But tho' I confin'd my Family, I could not prevail
upon my un&s;atisfy'd Curio&s;ity to &s;tay within entirely
my &s;elf; and tho' I generally came frighted and ter|rified
Home, yet I cou'd not re&s;train; only that in|deed,
I did not do it &s;o frequently as at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I had &s;ome little Obligations indeed upon me, to
go to my Brothers Hou&s;e, which was in <HI>Coleman's-&s;treet</HI>
Pari&s;h, and which he had left to my Care, and
I went at fir&s;t every Day, but afterwards only once,
or twice a Week.</P>
<P>In the&s;e Walks I had many di&s;mal Scenes before
my Eyes, as particularly of Per&s;ons falling dead in the
Streets, terrible Shrieks and Skreekings of Women,
who in their Agonies would throw open their Cham|ber
Windows, and cry out in a di&s;mal Surpri&s;ing
Manner; it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the Variety of
Po&s;tures, in which the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Poor People
would Expre&s;s them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing thro' <HI>Token-Hou&s;e-Yard</HI> in <HI>Lothbury,</HI> of a
&s;udden a Ca&s;ement violently opened ju&s;t over my
Head, and a Woman gave three frightful Skreetches,
<PB N="96" REF="98">
and then cry'd, <HI>Oh! Death, Death, Death!</HI> in a mo&s;t
inimitable Tone, and which &s;truck me with Horror
and a Chilne&s;s, in my very Blood. There was no
Body to be &s;een in the whole Street, neither did
any other Window open; for People had no Curio|&s;ity
now in any Ca&s;e; nor could any Body help one
another; &s;o I went on to pa&s;s into <HI>Bell-Alley.</HI></P>
<P>Ju&s;t in <HI>Bell-Alley,</HI> on the right Hand of the Pa&s;|&s;age,
there was a more terrible Cry than that, tho'
it was not &s;o directed out at the Window, but the
whole Family was in a terrible Fright, and I could
hear Women and Children run skreaming about the
Rooms like di&s;tracted, when a Garret Window open|ed,
and &s;ome body from a Window on the other Side
the Alley, call'd and ask'd, <HI>What is the Matter?</HI> up|on
which, from the fir&s;t Window it was an&s;wered,
<HI>O Lord, my Old Ma&s;ter has hang'd him&s;elf!</HI> The other
ask'd again, <HI>Is he quite dead?</HI> and the fir&s;t an&s;wer'd,
<HI>Ay, ay, quite dead; quite dead and cold!</HI> This Per&s;on
was a Merchant, and a Deputy Alderman and very
rich. I care not to mention the Name, tho' I knew
his Name too, but that would be an Hard&s;hip to
the Family, which is now flouri&s;hing again.</P>
<P>But, this is but one; it is &s;carce credible what
dreadful Ca&s;es happened in particular Families eve|ry
Day; People in the Rage of the Di&s;temper, or
in the Torment of their Swellings, which was indeed
intollerable, running out of their own Government,
raving and di&s;tracted, and oftentimes laying vio|lent
Hands upon them&s;elves, throwing them&s;elves
out at their Windows, &s;hooting them&s;elves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Mo|thers
murthering their own Children, in their Luna|cy,
&s;ome dying of meer Grief as a Pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ome of
meer Fright and Surprize, without any Infection at
all; others frighted into Idioti&s;m, and fooli&s;h Di|&s;tractions,
&s;ome into di&s;pair and Lunacy; others in|to
mellancholy Madne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Pain of the Swelling was in particular very
violent, and to &s;ome intollerable; the Phy&s;icians
<PB N="97" REF="99">
and Surgeons may be &s;aid to have tortured ma|ny
poor Creatures, even to Death. The Swell|lings
in &s;ome grew hard, and they apply'd violent
drawing Pla&s;ters, or Pultices, to break them; and
if the&s;e did not do, they cut and &s;carified them in a
terrible Manner: In &s;ome, tho&s;e Swellings were
made hard, partly by the Force of the Di&s;temper,
and partly by their being too violently drawn, and
were &s;o hard, that no In&s;trument could cut them,
and then they burnt them with Cau&s;ticks, &s;o that
many died raving mad with the Torment; and
&s;ome in the very Operation. In the&s;e Di&s;tre&s;&s;es,
&s;ome for want of Help to hold them down in their
Beds, or to look to them, laid Hands upon them|&s;elves,
as above. Some broke out into the Streets,
perhaps naked, and would run directly down to
the River, if they were not &s;topt by the Watchmen,
or other Officers, and plunge them&s;elves into the
Water, wherever they found it.</P>
<P>It often pierc'd my very Soul to hear the Groans
and Crys of tho&s;e who were thus tormented, but of
the Two, this was counted the mo&s;t promi&s;ing Parti|cular
in the whole Infection; for, if the&s;e Swellings
could be brought to a Head, and to break and run,
or as the Surgeons call it, to dige&s;t, the Patient ge|nerally
recover'd; whereas tho&s;e, who like the Gen|tlewoman's
Daughter, were &s;truck with Death at
the Beginning, and had the Tokens come out upon
them, often went about indifferent ea&s;y, till a lit|tle
before they died, and &s;ome till the Moment they
dropt down, as in Appoplexies and Epelep&s;ies, is of|ten
the Ca&s;e; &s;uch would be taken &s;uddenly ve|ry
&s;ick, and would run to a Bench or Bulk, or any
convenient Place that offer'd it &s;elf, or to their own
Hou&s;es, if po&s;&s;ible, <HI>as I mentioned before&punc;</HI> and there
$it down, grow faint and die. This kind of dying was
much the &s;ame, as it was with tho&s;e who die of com|mon
Mortifications, who die &s;wooning, and as it
were, go away in a Dream; &s;uch as died thus, had
<PB N="98" REF="100">
very little Notice of their being infected at all, till
the Gangreen was &s;pread thro' their whole Body;
nor could Phy&s;icians them&s;elves, know certainly
how it was with them, till they opened their Brea&s;ts,
or other Parts of their Body, and &s;aw the Tokens.</P>
<P>We had at this Time a great many frightful Sto|ries
told us of Nur&s;es and Watchmen, who looked
after the dying People, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> hir'd Nur&s;es,
who attended infected People, u&s;ing them barbarou&s;|ly,
&s;tarving them &s;mothering them, or by other
wicked Means, ha&s;tening their End, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI>
murthering of them: And Watchmen being &s;et
to guard Hou&s;es that were &s;hut up, when there has
been but one per&s;on left, and perhaps, that one ly|ing
&s;ick, that they have broke in and murthered
that Body, and immediately thrown them out into
the Dead-Cart! and &s;o they have gone &s;carce cold
to the Grave.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay, but that &s;ome &s;uch Murthers were
committed, and I think two were &s;ent to Pri&s;on for
it, but died before they could be try'd; and I have
heard that three others, at &s;everal Times, were ex|cu&s;ed
for Murthers of that kind; but I mu&s;t &s;ay I
believe nothing of its being &s;o common a Crime, as
&s;ome have &s;ince been pleas'd to &s;ay, nor did it &s;eem
to be &s;o rational, where the People were brought &s;o
low as not to be able to help them&s;elves, for &s;uch
&s;eldom recovered, and there was no Temptation to
commit a Murder, at lea&s;t, none equal to the Fact
where they were &s;ure Per&s;ons would die in &s;o &s;hort
a Time; and could not live.</P>
<P>That there were a great many Robberies and
wicked Practi&s;es committed even in this dreadful
Time I do not deny; the Power of Avarice was &s;o
&s;trong in &s;ome, that they would run any Hazard to
&s;teal and to plunder, and particularly in Hou&s;es
where all the Families, or Inhabitants have been
dead, and carried out, they would break in at all
Hazards, and without Regard to the Danger of In|fection,
<PB N="99" REF="101">
take even the Cloths off, of the dead Bodies,
and the Bed-cloaths from others where they lay dead.</P>
<P>This, <HI>I &s;uppo&s;e,</HI> mu&s;t be the Ca&s;e of a Family in
<HI>Hound&s;ditch,</HI> where a Man and his Daughter, <HI>the
re&s;t of the Family being, as I &s;uppo&s;e, carried away be|fore
by the Dead-Cart,</HI> were found &s;tark naked, one
in one Chamber, and one in another, lying Dead on
the Floor; and the Cloths of the Beds, from whence,
tis &s;uppo&s;ed they were roll'd off by Thieves, &s;toln,
and carried quite away.</P>
<P>It is indeed to be ob&s;erv'd, that the Women were
in all this Calamity, the mo&s;t ra&s;h, fearle&s;s, and de&s;|perate
Creatures; and as there were va&s;t Numbers
that went about as Nur&s;es, to tend tho&s;e that were
&s;ick, they committed a great many petty Thieve|ries
in the Hou&s;es where they were employed; and
&s;ome of them were publickly whipt for it, when
perhaps, they ought rather to have been hanged
for Examples; for Numbers of Hou&s;es were robbed
on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, till at length, the Pari&s;h Of|ficers
were &s;ent to recommend Nur&s;es to the Sick,
and always took an Account who it was they &s;ent,
&s;o as that they might call them to account, if the
Hou&s;e had been abu&s;ed where they were placed.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Robberies extended chiefly to Wearing-Cloths,
Linen, and what Rings, or Money they could
come at, when the Per&s;on dyed who was under their
Care, but not to a general Plunder of the Hou&s;es;
and I could give an Account of one of the&s;e Nur&s;es,
who &s;everal Years after, being on her Death-bed,
confe&s;t with the utmo&s;t Horror, the Robberries &s;he
had committed at the Time of her being a Nur&s;e,
and by which &s;he had enriched her &s;elf to a great
Degree: But as for murthers, I do not find that
there was ever any Proof of the Facts, in the man|ner,
as it has been reported, <HI>except as above.</HI></P>
<P>They did tell me indeed of a Nur&s;e in one
place, that laid a wet Cloth upon the Face of a dy|ing
Patient, who &s;he tended, and &s;o put an End
<PB N="100" REF="102">
to his Life, who was ju&s;t expiring before: And another
that &s;mother'd a young Woman &s;he was looking to,
when &s;he was in a fainting fit, and would have come
to her &s;elf: Some that kill'd them by giving them
one Thing, &s;ome another, and &s;ome &s;tarved them by
giving them nothing at all: But the&s;e Stories had two
Marks of Su&s;picion that always attended them, which
cau&s;ed me always to &s;light them, and to look on them
as meer Stories, that People continually frighted one
another with. (1.) That wherever it was that we
heard it, they always placed the Scene at the far|ther
End of the Town, oppo&s;ite, or mo&s;t remote
from where you were to hear it: If you heard it in
<HI>White-Chapel,</HI> it had happened at St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s, or at
<HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> or <HI>Holborn,</HI> or that End of the Town;
if you heard of it at that End of the Town, then
it was done in <HI>White-Chapel,</HI> or the <HI>Minories,</HI> or about
<HI>Cripplegate</HI> Pari&s;h: If you heard of it in the City,
why, then it had happened in <HI>Southwark;</HI> and if you
heard of it in <HI>Southwark,</HI> then it was done in the City,
and the like.</P>
<P>In the next Place, of what Part &s;oever you heard
the Story, the Particulars were always the &s;ame, e&s;pe|cially
that of laying a wet double Clout$on a dying
Man's Face, and that of &s;mothering a young Gentle|woman;
&s;o that it was apparent, at lea&s;t to my Judg|ment,
that there was more of Tale than of Truth in
tho&s;e Things.</P>
<P>However, I cannot &s;ay, but it had &s;ome Effect up|on
the People, and particnlarly that, <HI>as I &s;aid be|fore,</HI>
they grew more cautious who they took into
their Hou&s;es, and who they tru&s;ted their Lives with;
and had them always recommended, if they could;
and where they could not find &s;uch, for they were
not very plenty, they applied to the Pari&s;h Of|ficers.</P>
<P>But here again, the Mi&s;ery of that Time lay upo$
the Poor, who being infected, had neither Food o$
Phy&s;ick; neither Phy&s;ician or Appothecary to a&s;&s;i&s;$
<PB N="101" REF="103">
them, or Nur&s;e to attend them: Many of tho&s;e died
calling for help, and even for Su&s;tenance out at their
Windows, in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable and deplorable man|ner;
but it mu&s;t be added, that when ever the Ca|&s;es
of &s;uch Per&s;ons or Families, were repre&s;ented to
my Lord-Mayor, they always were reliev'd.</P>
<P>It is true, in &s;ome Hou&s;es where the People were
not very poor; yet, where they had &s;ent perhaps
their Wives and Children away; and if they had any
Servants, they had been di&s;mi&s;t; <HI>I &s;ay it is true, that</HI>
to &s;ave the Expences, many &s;uch as the&s;e &s;hut
them&s;elves in, and not having Help, dy'd alone.</P>
<P>A Neighbour and Acquaintance of mine, having
&s;ome Money owing to him from a Shopkeeper in
<HI>White-Cro&s;s-&s;treet,</HI> or there abouts, &s;ent his Appren|tice,
a youth about 18 Years of Age, to endeavour
to get the Money: He came to the Door, and find|ing
it &s;hut, knockt pretty hard, and as he thought,
heard &s;ome Body an&s;wer within, but was not &s;ure,
So he waited, and after &s;ome &s;tay knockt again, and
then a third Time, when he heard &s;ome Body com|ing
down Stairs.</P>
<P>At length the Man of the Hou&s;e came to the Door;
he had on his Breeches or Drawers, and a yellow
Flannel Wa&s;tcoat; no Stockings, a pair of Slipt-Shoes,
a white Cap on his head; and as the young Man
&s;aid, Death in his Face.</P>
<P>When he open'd the Door, &s;ays he, <HI>what do you
di&s;turb me thus for?</HI> the Boy, tho' a little &s;urpriz'd, re|ply'd,
<HI>I come from &s;uch a one, and my Ma&s;ter &s;ent me
for the Money, which he &s;ays you know of: Very well
Child,</HI> returns the living Gho&s;t, <HI>call as you go by at</HI>
Cripplegate <HI>Church, and bid them ring the Bell,</HI> and with
tho&s;e Words, &s;hut the Door again, and went up a|gain
and Dy'd, The &s;ame Day; nay, perhaps the
&s;ame Hour. This, the young Man told me him&s;elf,
and I have Rea&s;on to believe it. This was while
the Plague was not come to a Height: I think it
was in <HI>June;</HI> Towards the latter End of the Month,
<PB N="102" REF="104">
it mu&s;t be before the Dead Carts came about, and
while they u&s;ed the Ceremony of Ringing the Bell
for the Dead, which was over for certain, in that Pa|ri&s;h
at lea&s;t, before the Month of <HI>July;</HI> for by the
25<HI>th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> there died 550 and upward in a Week,
and then they cou'd no more bury in Form, Rich or
Poor.</P>
<P>I have mention'd above, that notwith&s;tanding this
dreadful Calamity; yet the Numbers of Thieves
were abroad upon all Occa&s;ions, where they had
found any Prey; and that the&s;e were generally Wo|men.
It was one Morning about 11 a Clock, I
had walk'd out to my Brothers Hou&s;e in <HI>Coleman's-&s;treet</HI>
Pari&s;h, as I often did, to &s;ee that all was Safe.</P>
<P>My Brother's Hou&s;e had a little Court be|fore
it, and a Brick-Wall with a Gate in it; and
within that, &s;everal Ware-hou&s;es, where his Goods
of &s;everal Sorts lay: It happen'd, that in one of the&s;e
Ware-hou&s;es, were &s;everal Packs of Womens high-Crown'd
Hats, which came out of the Country; and
were, as I &s;uppo&s;e, for Exportation; whither I know
not.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpriz'd that when I came near my Brother's
Door, which was in a Place they call'd <HI>Swan-Alley,</HI>
I met three or four Women with High-crown'd Hats
on their Heads; and as I remembred afterwards,
one, if not more, had &s;ome Hats likewi&s;e in their
Hands: but as I did not &s;ee them come out at my
Brother's Door, and not knowing that my Brother
had any &s;uch Goods in his Ware-hou&s;e, I did not
offer to &s;ay any Thing to them, but went cro&s;s the
Way to &s;hun meeting them, as was u&s;ual to do at
that Time, for fear of the Plague. But when I came
nearer to the Gate, I met another Woman with
more Hats come out of the Gate. <HI>What Bu&s;ine&s;s
Mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>have you had there?</HI> There are more
People there, &s;aid &s;he, I have had no more Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
there than they. I was ha&s;ty to get to the Gate
then, and &s;aid no more to her; by which means &s;he
<PB N="103" REF="105">
got away. But ju&s;t as I came to the Gate, I
&s;aw two more coming cro&s;s the Yard to come out
with Hats al&s;o on their Heads, and under their
Arms; at which I threw the Gate too behind me,
which having a Spring Lock fa&s;tened it &s;elf; and
turning to the Women, for&s;ooth &s;aid I, what are
ye <HI>doing here?</HI> and &s;eiz'd upon the Hats, and took
them from them. One of them, who I confe&s;s,
did not look like a Thief. Indeed &s;ays &s;he, we are
wrong; but we were told, they were Goods that
had no Owner; be pleas'd to take them again, and
look yonder, there are more &s;uch Cu&s;tomers as we:
She cry'd and look'd pitifully; &s;o I took the Hats
from her, and opened the Gate, and bad them be
gone, for I pity'd the Women indeed; But when I
look'd towards the Ware-hou&s;e, as &s;he directed,
there were &s;ix or &s;even more all, Women, fitting them|&s;elves
with Hats, as unconcerned and quiet, as if
they had been at a Hatters Shop, buying for their
Money.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpriz'd, not at the Sight of &s;o many Thieves
only, but at the Circum&s;tances I was in; being now
to thru&s;t my &s;elf in among &s;o many People, who for
&s;ome Weeks, had been &s;o &s;hye of my &s;elf, that if I met
any Body in the Street, I would cro&s;s the Way
from them.</P>
<P>They were equally &s;urpriz'd, tho' on another Ac|count:
They all told me, they were Neighbours,
that they had heard any one might take them, that
they were no Bodies Goods, and the like. I talk't
big to them at fir&s;t; went back to the Gate, and
took out the Key; &s;o that they were all my Pri&s;o|ners;
threaten'd to Lock them all into the Ware-hou&s;e,
and go and fetch my Lord Mayor's Officers
for them.</P>
<P>They beg'd heartily, prote&s;ted they found the
Gate open, and the Ware-hou&s;e Door open; and
that it had no doubt been broken open by &s;ome,
who expected to find Goods of greater Value;
<PB N="104" REF="106">
which indeed, was rea&s;onable to believe, becau&s;e the
Lock was broke, and a Padlock that hung to the
Door on the out-&s;ide al&s;o loo&s;e; and not abundance
of the Hats carry'd away.</P>
<P>At length I con&s;ider'd, that this was not a Time
to be Cruel and Rigorous; and be&s;ides that, it
would nece&s;&s;arily oblige me to go much about, to
have &s;everal People come to me, and I go to &s;everal,
who&s;e Circum&s;tances of Health, I knew nothing of;
and that even, at this Time the Plague was &s;o high,
as that there dy'd 4000 a Week; &s;o that in &s;howing
my Re&s;entment, or even in &s;eeking Ju&s;tice for my
Brother's Goods, I might lo&s;e my own Life; &s;o I
contented my &s;elf, with taking the Names and Places
where &s;ome of them lived, who were really Inhabi|tants
in the Neighbourhood; and threatning that
my Brother &s;hould call them to an Account for it,
when he return'd to his Habitation.</P>
<P>Then I talk'd a little upon another Foot with
them; and ask'd them how they could do &s;uch Things
as the&s;e, in a Time of &s;uch general Calamity; and
as it were, in the Face of Gods mo&s;t dreadful Judg|ments,
when the Plague was at their very Doors;
and it may be in their very Hou&s;es; and they did not
know, but that the Dead-Cart might &s;top at their
Doors in a few Hours, to carry them to their Graves.</P>
<P>I cou'd not perceive that my Di&s;cour&s;e made much
Impre&s;&s;ion upon them all that while; till it happened,
that there came two Men of the Neighbourhood,
hearing of the Di&s;turbance, and knowing my Brother,
for they had been both dependants upon his Family,
and they came to my A&s;&s;i&s;tance: The&s;e being as I
&s;aid Neighbours, pre&s;ently knew three of the Wo|men,
and told me who they were, and where they
liv'd; and it &s;eems, they had given me a true Account
of them&s;elves before.</P>
<P>This brings the&s;e two Men to a farther Remem|brance:
The Name of one was <HI>John Hayward,</HI> who
was at that Time under-Sexton, of the Pari&s;h of St.
<PB N="105" REF="107">
<HI>Stephen Coleman-&s;treet;</HI> by under Sexton, was under|&s;tood
at that Time Grave-digger and Bearer of the
Dead. This Man carry'd or a&s;&s;i&s;ted to carry
all the Dead to their Graves, which were bury'd
in that large pari&s;h, and who were carried in Form;
and after that Form of Burying was &s;topt, went with
the Dead Cart and the Bell, to fetch the dead Bodies
from the Hou&s;es where they lay, and fetch'd many
of them out of the Chambers and Hou&s;es; for the
Pari&s;h was, and is &s;till remarkable, particularly above
all the Pari&s;hes in <HI>London,</HI> for a great Number of Al|leys,
and Thorough fares very long, into which no Carts
cou'd come, and where they were oblig'd to go and
fetch the Bodies a very long Way; which Alleys now
remain to Witne&s;s it; &s;uch as <HI>Whites-Alley, Cro&s;s-Key-Court,
Swan-Alley, Bell-Alley, White-Hor&s;e-Alley,</HI> and
many more: Here they went with a kind of Hand-Barrow,
and lay'd the Dead Bodies on it, and car|ry'd
them out to the Carts; which work he perform|ed,
and never had the Di&s;temper at all, but liv'd
above 20 Year after it, and was Sexton of the Pari&s;h
to the Time of his Death. His Wife at the &s;ame, time
was a Nur&s;e to infected People, and tended many
that died in the Pari&s;h, being for her hone&s;ty recom|mended
by the Pari&s;h Officers, yet &s;he never was in|fected
neither.</P>
<P>He never u&s;ed any Pre&s;ervative again&s;t the Infecti|on,
other than holding <HI>Garlick</HI> and <HI>Rue</HI> in his Mouth,
and &s;moaking Tobacco; this I al&s;o had from his
own Mouth; and his Wife's Remedy was wa&s;hing
her Head in Vinegar, and &s;prinkling her Head-Cloths
&s;o with Vinegar, as to keep them always Moi&s;t; and
if the &s;mell of any of tho&s;e &s;he waitd on was more
than ordinary Offen&s;ive, &s;he &s;nuft Vinegar up her
No&s;e, and &s;prinkled Vinegar upon her Head-Cloths,
and held a Handkerchief weted with Vinegar to her
Mouth.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;t, that tho' the Plague was chief|ly
among the Poor; yet, were the Poor the mo&s;t
<PB N="106" REF="108">
Venturous and Fearle&s;s of it, and went about their
Employment, with a Sort of brutal Courage; I mu&s;t
call it &s;o, for it was founded neither on Religion or
Prudence; &s;car&s;e did they u&s;e any Caution, but run
into any Bu&s;ine&s;s, which they conld get Employment
in, tho' it was the mo&s;t hazardous; &s;uch was that of
tending the Sick, watching Hou&s;es &s;hut up, carrying
infected Per&s;ons to the Pe&s;t-Hou&s;e; and which was
&s;till wor&s;e, carrying the Dead away to their Graves.</P>
<P>It was under this <HI>John Hayward's</HI> Care, and within
his Bounds, that the Story of the Piper, with which
People have made them&s;elves &s;o merry, happen'd, and
he a&s;&s;ur'd me that it was true. It is &s;aid, that it was
a blind Piper; but as <HI>John</HI> told me, the Fellow was
not blind, but an ignorant weak poor Man, and u&s;ual|ly
walked his Rounds about 10 a Clock at Night,
and went piping along from Door to Door, and the
People u&s;ually took him in at Public Hou&s;es where
they knew him, and would give him Drink and Vict|uals,
and &s;ometimes Farthings; and he in Return,
would Pipe and Sing, and talk &s;imply, which divert|ed
the People, and thus he liv'd: It was but a very
bad Time for this Diver&s;ion, while Things were as
I have told; yet the poor Fellow went about as u&s;ual,
but was almo&s;t &s;tarv'd; and when any Body ask'd
how he did, he would an&s;wer, the Dead Cart had
not taken him yet, but that they had promi&s;ed to call
for him next Week.</P>
<P>It happen'd one Night, that this poor Fellow, whe|whether
&s;ome body had given him too much Drink or
no, <HI>John Hayward</HI> &s;aid, he had not Drink in his
Hou&s;e; but that they had given him a little more Vict|uals
than ordinary at a Public Hou&s;e in <HI>Coleman-&s;treet;</HI>
and the poor Fellow having not u&s;ually had a Belly|full,
or perhaps not a good while, was laid all along
upon the Top of a Bulk or Stall, and fa&s;t a &s;leep at a
Door, in the Street near <HI>London-Wall,</HI> towards Cripple+gate,
<PB N="107" REF="109">
and that upon the &s;ame Bulk or Stall, the Peo|ple
of &s;ome Hou&s;e, in the Alley of which the Hou&s;e
was a Corner, hearing a Bell, which they always
rung before the Cart came, had laid a Body really
dead of the Plague ju&s;t by him, thinking too, that
this poor Fellow had been a dead Body as the other
was, and laid there by &s;ome of the Neighbours.</P>
<P>Accordingly when <HI>John Hayward</HI> with his Bell and
the Cart came along, finding two dead Bodies lie up|on
the Stall they took them up with the In&s;trument
they u&s;ed, and threw them into the Cart; and all
this while the Piper &s;lept &s;oundly.</P>
<P>From hence they pa&s;&s;ed along, and took in o|ther
dead Bodies, till, as hone&s;t <HI>John Hayward</HI> told
me, they almo&s;t burried him alive, in the Cart,
yet all this While he &s;lept &s;oundly; at length the
Cart came to the Place where the Bodies were to be
thrown into the Ground, which, as I do remember,
was at <HI>Mount-mill;</HI> and as the Cart u&s;ually &s;topt &s;ome
Time before they were ready to &s;hoot out the melan|cholly
Load they had in it, as &s;oon as the Cart &s;top'd,
the Fellow awaked, and &s;truggled a little to get his
Head out from among the dead Bodies, when rai&s;ing
him&s;elf up in the Cart, he called out, <HI>Hey! where am
I?</HI> This frighted the Fellow that attended about the
Work, but after &s;ome Pau&s;e <HI>John Hayward</HI> recovering
him&s;elf &s;aid, <HI>Lord ble&s;s us. There's &s;ome Body in the Cart
not quite dead!</HI> So another call'd to him and &s;aid, <HI>Who
are you?</HI> the Fellow an&s;wered, <HI>I am the poor Piper.
Where am I? Where are you!</HI> &s;ays <HI>Hayward; why, you
are in the Dead-Cart, and we are a-going to bury you. But
I an't dead tho', am I?</HI> &s;ays the Piper; which made
them laugh a little, tho' as <HI>John</HI> &s;aid, they were hear
tily frighted at fir&s;t; &s;o they help'd the poor Fellow
down, and he went about his Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I know the Story goes, he &s;et up his Pipes in the
Cart, and frighted the Bearers, and others, &s;o that
they ran away; but <HI>John Hayward</HI> did not tell the
Story &s;o, nor &s;ay any Thing of his Piping at all; but
<PB N="108" REF="110">
that he was a poor Piper, and that he was carried
away as above I am fully &s;atisfied of the Truth of.</P>
<P>It is to be noted here, that the Dead Carts in the
City were not not confin'd to particular Pari&s;hes, but
one Cart went thro' &s;everal Pari&s;hes, according as the
Numbers of Dead pre&s;ented; nor were they ty'd to
carry the Dead to their re&s;pective Pari&s;hes, but ma|ny
of the Dead, taken up in the City, were carried
to the Burying Ground in the Out-parts, for want
of Room.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned the Surprize, that this
Judgment was at fir&s;t among the People, I mu&s;t
be allowed to give &s;ome of my Ob&s;ervations on the
more &s;erious and religious Part. Surely never City,
at lea&s;t, of this Bulk and Magnitude, was taken in
a Condition &s;o perfectly unprepar'd for &s;uch a dread|ful
Vi&s;itation, whether I am to &s;peak of the Civil
Preparations, or Religious; they were indeed, as
if they had had no Warning, no Expectation, no Ap|prehen&s;ions,
and con&s;equently the lea&s;t Provi&s;ion ima|ginable,
was made for it in a publick Way; for Ex|ample.</P>
<P>The Lord Mayor and Sheriffs had made no Pro|vi&s;ion
as Magi&s;trates, for the Regulations which
were to be ob&s;erved; they had gone into no Mea|&s;ures
for Relief of the Poor.</P>
<P>The Citizens had no publick Magazines, or Store-Hou&s;es
for Corn, or Meal, for the Sub&s;i&s;tence of the
Poor; which, if they had provided them&s;elves, as in
&s;uch Ca&s;es is done abroad, many mi&s;erable Families,
who were now reduc'd to the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s, would
have been reliev'd, and that in a better Manner, than
now could be done.</P>
<P>The Stock of the City's Money, I can &s;ay but little
to, the Chamber of <HI>London</HI> was &s;aid to be exceeding
rich; and it may be concluded, that they were &s;o,
by the va&s;t Sums of Money i&s;&s;ued from thence, in the
re-building the publick Edifices after the Fire of <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
and in Building new Works, &s;uch as, for the
<PB N="109" REF="111">
fir&s;t Part, the <HI>Guild-Hall, Blackwell-Hall,</HI> Part of <HI>Lea|den
Hall,</HI> Half the <HI>Exchange,</HI> the <HI>Se&s;&s;ion-Hou&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Comp|ter;</HI>
the Pri&s;ons of <HI>Ludgate, Newgate, &amp;c.</HI> &s;everal of the
Wharfs, and Stairs, and Landing-places on the Ri|ver;
all which were either burnt down or damaged
by the great Fire of <HI>London,</HI> the next Year after the
Plague; and of the &s;econd Sort, the Monument, <HI>Fleet|ditch</HI>
with its Bridges, aud the Ho&s;pital of <HI>Bethlem,</HI> or
<HI>Bedlam, &amp;c.</HI> But po&s;&s;ibly the Managers of the City's
Credit, at that Time, made more Con&s;cience of break|ing
in upon the Orphan's Money; to &s;hew Charity
to the di&s;tre&s;s'd Citizens, than the Managers in the
following Years did, to beautify the City, and re|edify
the Buildings, tho' in the fir&s;t Ca&s;e, the Lo&s;ers
would have thought their Fortunes better be&s;tow'd,
and the Publick Faith of the City have been le&s;s &s;ub|jected
to Scandal and Reproach.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledg'd that the ab&s;ent Citizens,
who, tho' they were fled for Safety into the Coun|try,
were yet greatly intere&s;ted in the Welfare of tho&s;e
who they left behind, forgot not to contribute li|berally
to the Relief of the Poor, and large Sums
were al&s;o collected among Trading-Towns in the re|mote&s;t
Parts of of <HI>England;</HI> and as I have heard al&s;o,
the Nobility and the Gentry, in all Parts of <HI>England,</HI>
took the deplorable Condition of the City into their
Con&s;ideration, and &s;ent up large Sums of Money in
Charity, to the Lord Mayor and Magi&s;trates, for
the Relief of the Poor; the King al&s;o, as I was told,
ordered a thou&s;and Pounds a Week to be di&s;tribut|ed
in four Parts; one Quarter to the City and Li|berties
of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter:</HI> one Quarter, or Part, among
the Inhabitants of the <HI>Southwark</HI> Side of the Water;
one Quarter to the Liberty and Parts within, of the
City, exclu&s;ive of the City, within the Walls; and,
one fourth Part to the Suburbs in the County of
<HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> and the Ea&s;t and North Parts of the Ci|ty:
But this latter I only &s;peak of as a Report.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="112">
Certain it is, the greate&s;t Part of the Poor, or Fa|milies,
who formerly liv'd by their Labour, or by
Retail-Trade, liv'd now on Charity; and had there
not been prodigious Sums of Money given by chari|table,
well-minded Chri&s;tians, for the Support of
&s;uch, the City could never have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. There
were, no Que&s;tion, Accounts kept of their Chari|ty,
and of the ju&s;t Di&s;tribution of it by the Magi|&s;trates:
But as &s;uch Mulitudes of tho&s;e very Officers
died, thro' who&s;e Hands it was di&s;tributed; and al|&s;o
that, as I have been told, mo&s;t of the Accounts
of tho&s;e Things were lo&s;t in the great Fire which
happened in the very next Year, and which burnt e|ven
the Chamberlain's Office, and many of their
Papers; &s;o I could never come at the particular Ac|count,
which I u&s;ed great Endeavours to have &s;een.</P>
<P>It may, however, be a Direction in Ca&s;e of the
Approach of a like Vi&s;itation, which God keep the
City from; I &s;ay, it may be of u&s;e to ob&s;erve
that by the Care of the Lord Mayor and Aldermen,
at that Time, in di&s;tributing Weekly, great Sums
of Money, for Relief of the Poor, a Multitude of
People, who would otherwi&s;e have peri&s;hed, were
relieved, and their Lives pre&s;ervd. And here let
me enter into a brief State of the Ca&s;e of the Poor
at that Time, and what Way apprehended from them,
from whence may be judg'd hereafter, what may be
expected, if the like Di&s;tre&s;s &s;hould come upon the
City.</P>
<P>At the Beginning of the Plague, when there was
now no more Hope, but that the whole City would
be vi&s;ited, when, as I have &s;aid, all that had Friends
or E&s;tates in the Country, retired with their Fami|lies,
and when, indeed, one would have thought
the very City it &s;elf was running out of the Gates,
and that there would be no Body left behind. You
may be &s;ure, from that Hour, all Trade, except &s;uch
as related to immediate Sub&s;i&s;tence, was, <HI>as it were,</HI>
at a full Stop.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="113">
This is &s;o lively a Ca&s;e, and contains in it &s;o much
of the real Condition of the People; that I think,
I cannot be too particular in it; and therefore I de&s;cend
to the &s;everal Arrangements or Cla&s;&s;es of People, who
fell into immediate Di&s;tre&s;s upon this Occa&s;ion: For
Example,</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. All Ma&s;ter Work-men in Manufactures; e&s;pecially
&s;uch as belong'd to Ornament, and the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary
Parts of the People dre&s;s Cloths and Furniture for Hou|&s;es;
&s;uch as Riband Weavers, and other Weavers;
Gold and Silverlace-makers, and Gold and Silverwyer|drawers,
Seem&s;tre&s;&s;es, Milleners, Shoe-makers, Hat-ma|kers
and Glove-makers: Al&s;o Uphold&s;terers, Joyners, Ca|binet-makers,
Looking-gla&s;s-makers; and innumerable
Trades which depend upon &s;uch as the&s;e; I &s;ay the Ma|&s;ter
Workmen in &s;uch, &s;topt their Work, di&s;mi&s;t their
Journeymen, and Workmen, and all their Dependants.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As Merchandizing was at a full &s;top, for very few Ships
ventur'd to come up the River, and none at all went out; &s;o
all the extraordinary Officers of the Cu&s;tomes, likewi&s;e the
Watermen, Carmen, Parters, and all the Poor, who&s;e Labour
depended upon the Merchants, were at once di&s;mi&s;t, and
put out of Bu&s;ine&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. All the Trade&s;men u&s;ually employ'd in building or repare|ing
of Hou&s;es, were at a full Stop, for the People were far
from wanting to build Hou&s;es, when &s;o many thou&s;and
Hou&s;es were at once &s;tript of their Inhabitants; &s;o that this
one Article turn'd all the ordinary Work-men of that
Kind out of Bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;uch as Brick-layers, Ma&s;ons, Car|penters,
Joyners, Pla&s;terers, Painters, Glaziers, Smiths,
Plumbers; and all the Labourers depending on &s;uch.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. As Navigation was at a Stop; our Ships neither coming
in, or going out as before; &s;o the Seamen were all out of Em|ployment,
and many of them in the la&s;t and lowe&s;t Degree
of Di&s;tre&s;s, and with the Seamen, were all the &s;eve|ral
Trade&s;men, and Workmen belonging to and depend|ing
upon the building, and fitting out of Ships; &s;uch as
Ship Carpenters, Caulkers, Rope-makers, Dry-Coopers,
<PB N="112" REF="114">
Sail-makers, Anchor-Smiths, and other Smiths; Block-makers,
Carvers, Gun Smiths, Ship-Chandlers, Ship-Carvers
and the like; The Ma&s;ters of tho&s;e perhaps
might live upon their Sub&s;tance; but the Traders were
Univer&s;ally at a Stop, and con&s;equently all their Work|men
di&s;charged: Add to the&s;e, that the River was in a
manner without Boats, and all or mo&s;t part of the Wa|termen,
Lightermen, Boat-builders, and Lighter-buil|ders
in like manner idle, and laid by.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. All Families retrench'd their living as much as po&s;&s;ible,
as well tho&s;e that fled, as tho&s;e that &s;tay'd; &s;o that an in|numerable
Multitude of Footmen, &s;erving Men, Shop-keepers,
Journey-men, Merchants-Book-keepers, and
&s;uch Sort of People, and e&s;pecially poor Maid Servants
were turn'd off, and left Friendle&s;s and Helple&s;s without
Employment, and without Habitation; and this was
really a di&s;mal Article.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>I might be more particular as to this Part: But
it may &s;uffice to mention in general; all Trades be|ing
&s;topt, Employment cea&s;ed; the Labour, and by
that, the Bread of the Poor were cut off; and at fir&s;t
indeed, the Cries of the poor were mo&s;t lamentable to
hear; tho' by the Di&s;tribution of Charity, their
Mi&s;ery that way was greatly abated: Many indeed
fled into the Countries; but thou&s;ands of them having
&s;tay'd in <HI>London,</HI> till nothing but De&s;peration &s;ent
them away; Death overtook them on the Road, and
they &s;erv'd for no better than the Me&s;&s;engers of Death,
indeed, others carrying the Infection along with them;
&s;preading it very unhappily into the remote&s;t Parts of
the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e were the mi&s;erable Objects of Di&s;|pair
which I have mention'd before, and were re|mov'd
by the De&s;truction which followed; the&s;e
might be &s;aid to peri&s;h, not by the Infection it &s;elf,
but by the Con&s;equence of it; indeed, namely, by
Hunger and Di&s;tre&s;s, and the Want of all Things;
being without Lodging, without Money, without
<PB N="113" REF="115">
Friends, without Means to get their Bread, or with|out
any one to give it them, for many of them were
without what we call legal Settlements, and &s;o could
not claim of the Pari&s;hes, and all the Support they
had, was by Application to the Magi&s;trates for Relief,
which Relief was, (to give the Magi&s;trates their Due)
carefully and chearfully admini&s;tred, as they found it
nece&s;&s;ary; and tho&s;e that &s;tay'd behind never felt the
Want and Di&s;tre&s;s of that Kind, which they felt,
who went away in the manner above-noted.</P>
<P>Let any one who is acquainted with what Multi|tudes
of People, get their daily Bread in this City by
their Labour, whether Artificers or meer Workmen;
I &s;ay, let any Man con&s;ider, what mu&s;t be the mi&s;e|rable
Condition of this Town, if on a &s;udden, they
&s;hould be all turned out of Employment, that La|bour
&s;hould cea&s;e, and Wages for Work be no more.</P>
<P>This was the Ca&s;e with us at that Time, and had
not the Sums of Money, contributed in Charity by
well di&s;po&s;ed People, of every Kind, as well abroad
as at home, been prodigiou&s;ly great, it had not been
in the Power of the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, to
have kept the Publick Peace; nor were they without
Apprehen&s;ions as it was, that De&s;paration &s;hould pu&s;h
the People upon Tumults, and cau&s;e them to rifle the
Hou&s;es of rich Men, and plunder the Markets of Provi|&s;ions;
in which Ca&s;e the Country People, who brought
Provi&s;ions very freely and boldly to Town, would ha'
been terrified from coming any more, and the Town
would ha' &s;unk under an unavoidable Famine.</P>
<P>But the Prudence of my Lord Mayor, and the
Court of Aldermen within the City, and of the Ju|&s;tices
of Peace in the Out-parts was &s;uch, and they
were &s;upported with Money from all Parts &s;o well, that
the poor People were kept quiet, and their Wants eve|ry
where reliev'd, as far as was po&s;&s;ible to be done.</P>
<P>Two Things, be&s;ides this, contributed to prevent
the Mob doing any Mi&s;chief: One was, that really
the Rich them&s;elves had not laid up Stores of Provi|&s;ions
<PB N="114" REF="116">
in their Hou&s;es, as indeed, they ought to have
done, and which if they had been wi&s;e enough to have
done, and lock'd them&s;elves entirely up, as &s;ome few
did, they had perhaps e&s;caped the Di&s;ea&s;e better: But
as it appear'd they had not, &s;o the Mob had no No|tion
of finding Stores of Provi&s;ions there, if they had
broken in, as it is plain they were &s;ometimes very
near doing, and which, if they had, they had fini&s;h'd
the Ruin of the whole City, for there were no regu|lar
Troops to ha' with&s;tood them, nor could the
Traind-Bands have been brought together to defend
the City, no Men being to be found to bear Arms.</P>
<P>But the Vigilance of the Lord Mayor, and &s;uch
Magi&s;trates as could be had, for &s;ome, even of the Al|dermen
were Dead, and &s;ome ab&s;ent, prevented this;
and they did it by the mo&s;t kind and gentle Me|thods
they could think of, as particularly by re|lieving
the mo&s;t de&s;perate with Money, and putting
others into Bu&s;ine&s;s and particularly that Employ|ment
of watching Hou&s;es that were infected and &s;hut
up; and as the Number of the&s;e were very great, for
it was &s;aid, there was at one Time, ten thou&s;and
Hou&s;es &s;hut up, and every Hou&s;e had two Watchmen
to guard it, <HI>viz</HI> one by Night, and the other by
Day; this gave Opportunity to employ a very great
Number of poor Men at a Time.</P>
<P>The Women, and Servants, that were turned off
from their Places, were likewi&s;e employed as Nur&s;es
to tend the Sick in all Places; and this took off a ve|ry
great Number of them.</P>
<P>And, which tho' a melancholy Article in it &s;elf,
yet was a Deliverance in its Kind, namely, the
Plague which raged in a dreadful Manner from the
Middle of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> to the Middle of <HI>October,</HI> carried off
in that Time thirty or forty Thou&s;and of the&s;e very
People, which had they been left, would certainly
have been an un&s;ufferable Burden, by their Poverty,
<HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> the whole City could not have &s;upport|ed
the Expence of them, or have provided Food for
<PB N="115" REF="117">
them; and they would in Time have been even dri|ven
to the Nece&s;&s;ity of plundering either the City it
&s;elf, or the Country adjacent, to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted them|&s;elves,
which would fir&s;t or la&s;t, have put the whole
Nation, a well as the City, into the utmo&s;t Terror
and Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;ervable then, that this Calamity of the
People made them very humble; for now, for about
nine Weeks together, there died near a thou&s;and a-Day,
one Day with another, even by the Account
of the weekly Bills, which yet I have Rea&s;on to
be a&s;&s;ur'd never gave a full Account, by many thou|&s;ands;
the Confu&s;ion being &s;uch, and the Carts work|ing
in the Dark, when they carried the Dead, that in
&s;ome Places no Account at all was kept, but they
work'd on; the Clerks and Sextons not attending for
Weeks together, and not knowing what Number they
carried. This Account is verified by the following
Bills of Mortality.</P>

<P>So that the Gro&s;s of the People were carried off in
the&s;e two Months; for as the whole Number which
was brought in, to die of the Plague, was but 68590
here, is fifty thou&s;and of them, within a Trifle, in
two Months; I &s;ay 50000, becau&s;e, as there wants
295 in the Number above, &s;o there wants two Days
of two Months, in the Account of Time.</P>
<P>Now when, I &s;ay, that the Pari&s;h Officers did not
give in a full Account, or were not to be depended
upon for their Account, let any one but con&s;ider how
<PB N="116" REF="118">
Men could be exact in &s;uch a Time of dreadful Di|&s;tre&s;s,
and when many of them were taken &s;ick them|&s;elves,
and perhaps died in the very Time when their
Accounts were to be given in, I mean the Pari&s;h-Clerks;
be&s;ides inferior Officers; for tho' the&s;e poor
Men ventured at all Hazards, yet they were far from
being exempt from the common Calamity, e&s;pecially,
if it be true, that the Pari&s;h of <HI>Stepney</HI> had within the
Year, one hundred and &s;ixteen Sextons, Grave-diggers,
and their A&s;&s;i&s;tants, that is to &s;ay, Bearers, Bell-men,
and Drivers of Carts, for carrying off the dead Bodies.</P>
<P>Indeed the Work was not of a Nature to allow
them Lei&s;ure, to take an exact Tale of the dead Bo|dies,
which were all huddled together in the Dark
into a Pit; which Pit, or Trench, no Man could
come nigh, but at the utmo&s;t Peril. I ob&s;erv'd of|ten,
that in the Pari&s;hes of <HI>Algate,</HI> and <HI>Cripplegate,
White-Chappel</HI> and <HI>Stepney,</HI> there was five, &s;ix, &s;even,
and eight hundred in a Week, in the Bills, whereas
if we may believe the Opinion of tho&s;e that liv'd in
the City, all the Time, as well as I, there died &s;ome|times
2000 a-Week in tho&s;e Pari&s;hes; and I &s;aw it
under the Hand of one, that made as &s;trict an exa|mination
into that Part as he could, that there really
died an hundred thou&s;and People of the Plague, in
it that one Year, whereas the Bills, the Articles of
the Plague, was but 68590.</P>
<P>If I may be allowed to give my Opinion, by what
I &s;aw with my Eyes, and heard from other People
that were Eye Witne&s;&s;es, I do verily believe the &s;ame,
<HI>viz.</HI> that there died, at lea&s;t, 100000 of the Plague
only, be&s;ides other Di&s;tempers, and be&s;ides tho&s;e
which died in the Fields, and High-ways, and &s;e|cret
Places, out of the Compa&s;s of the Communica|tion,
as it was called; and who were not put down in
the Bills, tho' they really belonged to the Body of
the Inhabitants. It was known to us all, that abun|dance
of poor di&s;pairing Creatures, who had the
Di&s;temper upon them, and were grown &s;tupid, or
<PB N="117" REF="119">
melancholly by their Mi&s;ery, as many were, wan|dred
away into the Fields, and Woods, and into &s;e|cret
uncouth Places, almo&s;t any where to creep into
a Bu&s;h, or Hedge, and DIE.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the Villages adjacent would in
Pity, carry them Food, and &s;et it at a Di&s;tance, that
they might fetch it, if they were able, and &s;ometimes
they were not able; and the next Time they went,
they &s;hould find the poor Wretches lie dead, and the
Food untouch'd. The Number of the&s;e mi&s;erable Ob|jects
were many, and I know &s;o many that peri&s;h'd
thus, and &s;o exactly where, that I believe I could go
to the very Place and dig their Bones up &s;till; for the
Country People would go and dig a Hole at a Di|&s;tance
from them, and then with long Poles, and
Hooks at the End of them, drag the Bodies into the&s;e
Pits, and then thro' the Earth in Form as far as they
could ca&s;t it to cover them; taking notice how the
Wind blew, and &s;o coming on that Side which the Sea|men
call <HI>to-Wind-ward,</HI> that the Scent of the Bodies
might blow from them; and thus great Numbers
went out of the World, who were never known or
any Account of them taken, as well within the Bills
of Mortality as without.</P>
<P>This indeed I had, in the main, only from the Re|lation
of others; for I &s;eldom walk'd into the Fields,
except towards <HI>Bednal-green</HI> and <HI>Hackney;</HI> or as here|after:
But when I did walk I always &s;aw a great ma|ny
poor Wanderers at a Di&s;tance, but I could know
little of their Ca&s;es; for whether it were in the Street,
or in the Fields, if we had &s;een any Body coming, it
was a general Method to walk away; yet I believe
the Account is exactly true.</P>
<P>As this puts me upon mentioning my walking
the Streets and Fields, I cannot omit taking no|tice
what a de&s;olate Place the City was at that
Time: The great Street I liv'd in, which is known
to be one of the broade&s;t of all the Streets of <HI>Lon|don.</HI>
I mean of the Suburbs as well as the Liber|ties;
<PB N="118" REF="120">
all the Side where the Butchers lived, e&s;pecial|ly
without the Bars was more like a green Field
than a paved Street, and the People generally went
in the middle with the Hor&s;es and Carts: It is true,
that the farthe&s;t End towards <HI>White-Chappel</HI> Church,
was not all pav'd, but even the Part that was pav'd
was full of Gra&s;s al&s;o; but this need not &s;eem &s;trange
&s;ince the great Streets within the City, &s;uch as <HI>Lea|den-hall-Street,
Bi&s;hopgate-Street, Cornhill,</HI> and even the
<HI>Exchange</HI> it &s;elf, had Gra&s;s growing in them, in &s;e|veral
Places; neither Cart or Coach were &s;een in the
Streets from Morning to Evening, except &s;ome Coun|try
Carts to bring Roots and Beans, or Pea&s;e, Hay
and Straw, to the Market, and tho&s;e but very few,
compared to what was u&s;ual: As for Coaches they
were &s;carce u&s;ed, but to carry &s;ick People to the Pe&s;t-Hou&s;e,
and to other Ho&s;pitals; and &s;ome few to carry
Phy&s;icians to &s;uch Places as they thought fit to ven|ture
to vi&s;it; for really Coaches were dangerous things,
and People did not Care to venture into them, becau&s;e
they did not know who might have been carried in
them la&s;t; and &s;ick infected People were, <HI>as I have
&s;aid,</HI> ordinarily carried in them to the Pe&s;t-Hou&s;es,
and &s;ometimes People expired in them as they went
along.</P>
<P>It is true, when the Infection came to &s;uch a Height
as I have now mentioned, there were very few Phy&s;i|cians,
which car'd to &s;tir abroad to &s;ick Hou&s;es, and
very many of the mo&s;t eminent of the Faculty were
dead as well as the Surgeons al&s;o, for now it was in|deed
a di&s;mal time, and for about a Month together,
not taking any Notice of the Bills of Mortality, I be|lieve
there did not die le&s;s than 1500 or 1700 a-Day,
one Day with another.</P>
<P>One of the wor&s;t Days we had in the whole Time,
as I thought, was in the Beginning of <HI>September,</HI> when
indeed good People began to think, that God was
re&s;olved to make a full End of the People in this mi|&s;erable
City. This was at that Time when the
<PB N="119" REF="121">
Plague was fully come into the Ea&s;tern Pari&s;hes: The
Pari&s;h of <HI>Algate,</HI> if I may give my Opinion buried above
a thou&s;and a Week for two Weeks, tho' the Bills did
not &s;ay &s;o many; but it &s;urrounded me at &s;o di&s;mal a
rate, that there was not a Hou&s;e in twenty uninfected;
in the <HI>Minories,</HI> in <HI>Hound&s;ditch,</HI> and in tho&s;e Parts of <HI>Al|gate</HI>
Pari&s;h about the <HI>Butcher-Row,</HI> and the Alleys over a|gani&s;t
me, I &s;ay in tho&s;e places Death reigned in every
Corner. <HI>White Chapel</HI> Pari&s;h was in the &s;ame Condi|tion,
and tho' muchle&s;s than the Pari&s;h I liv'd in; yet
bury'd near 600 a Week by the Bills; and in my Opi|nion,
near twice as many; whole Families, and indeed,
whole Streets of Familes were &s;wept away together;
in&s;omuch, that it was frequent for Neighbours to call
to the Bellman, to go to &s;uch and &s;uch Hou&s;es, and
fetch out the People, for that they were all Dead.</P>
<P>And indeed, the Work of removing the dead Bo|dies
by Carts, was now grown &s;o very odious and
dangerous, that it was complain'd of, that the Bearers
did not take Care to clear &s;uch Hou&s;es, where all the
Inhabitants were dead; but that &s;ometimes the Bodies
lay &s;everal Days unburied, till the neighbouring Fami|lies
were offended with the Stench, and con&s;equently
infect'd; and this neglect of the Officers was &s;uch, that
the Church Wardens and Con&s;tables were &s;ummon'd to
look after it; and even the Ju&s;tices of the <HI>Hamlets,</HI> were
oblig'd to venture their Lives among them, to quicken
and encourage them; for innumerable of the Bearers
dy'd of the Di&s;temper, infected by the Bodies they
were oblig'd to come &s;o near; and had it not been, that
the Number of poor People who wanted Employment,
and wanted Bread, (as I have &s;aid before,) was &s;o great,
that Nece&s;&s;ity drove them to undertake any Thing,
and venture any thing, they would never have found
People to be employ'd; and then the Bodies of the dead
would have lain above Ground, and have peri&s;hed and
rotted in a dreadful Manner.</P>
<P>But the Magi&s;trates cannot be enough commended
in this, that they kept &s;uch good Order for the bury|ing
<PB N="120" REF="122">
of the Dead, that as fa&s;t as any of tho&s;e they em|ploy'd
to carry off, and bury the dead, fell &s;ick or dy'd,
as was many Times the Ca&s;e, they immediately &s;up|ply'd
the places with others; which by rea&s;on of the
great Number of Poor that was left out of Bu&s;ine&s;s,
<HI>as above,</HI> was not hard to do: This occa&s;ion'd, that
notwith&s;tanding the infinite Number of People which
dy'd, and were &s;ick almo&s;t all together, yet, they were
always clear'd away, and carry'd off every Night;
&s;o that it was never to be &s;aid of <HI>London,</HI> that the
living were not able to bury the Dead.</P>
<P>As the De&s;olation was greater, during tho&s;e terrible
Times, &s;o the Amazement of the People encreas'd;
and a thou&s;and unaccountable Things they would do
in the violence of their Fright, as others did the &s;ame
in the Agonies of their Di&s;temper, and this part was
very affecting; &s;ome went roaring, and crying, and
wringing their Hands along the Street; &s;ome would
go praying, and lifting up their Hands to Heaven, call|ing
upon God for Mercy. I cannot &s;ay indeed, whether
this was not in their Di&s;traction; <HI>but be it &s;o,</HI> it was
&s;till an indication of a more &s;erious Mind, when they
had the u&s;e of their Sen&s;es, and was much better, <HI>even
as it was,</HI> than the frightful yellings and cryings that
every Day, and e&s;pecially in the Evenings, were heard
in &s;ome Streets. I &s;uppo&s;e the World has heard of the
famous <HI>Soloman Eagle</HI> an Enthu&s;ia&s;t: He tho' not in|fected
at all, but in his Head; went about denouncing
of Judgment upon the City in a frightful manner; &s;ome|times
quite naked, and with a Pan of burning Charcoal
on his Head: What he &s;aid or pretended, indeed I
could not learn.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay, whether that Clergyman was di&s;tra|cted
or not: Or whether he did it in pure Zeal for the
poor People who went every Evening thro' the Streets
of <HI>White-Chapel;</HI> and with his Hands lifted up, repeat|ed
that Part of the <HI>Liturgy</HI> of the Church continually;
<HI>Spare us good Lord, &s;pare thy People whom thou ha&s;t redeem|ed
withthy mo&s;t precious Blood,</HI> I &s;ay, I cannot &s;peak po&s;i|tively
<PB N="121" REF="123">
of the&s;e Things; becau&s;e the&s;e were only the
di&s;mal Objects which repre&s;ented them&s;elves to me as I
look'd thro' my Chamber Windows (for I &s;eldom open|ed
the Ca&s;ements) while I confin'd my &s;elf within
Doors, during that mo&s;t violent rageing of the Pe&s;ti|lence;
when indeed, as I have &s;aid, many began to
think, and even to &s;ay, that there would none e&s;cape;
and indeed, I began to think &s;o too; and therefore kept
within Doors, for about a Fortnight, and never &s;tirr'd
out: But I cou'd not hold it: Be&s;ides, there were
&s;ome People, who notwith&s;tanding the Danger, did
not omit publickly to attend the Wor&s;hip of God, even
in the mo&s;t dangerous Times; and tho' it is true,
that a great many Clergymen did &s;hut up their Chur|ches,
and fled as other People did, for the &s;afety of
their Lives; yet, all did not do &s;o, &s;ome ventur'd to
officiate, and to keep up the A&s;&s;emblies of the People
by con&s;tant Prayers; and &s;ometimes Sermons, or
Brief Exhortations to Repentance and Reformation,
and this as long as any would come to hear them;
and Di&s;&s;enters did the like al&s;o, and even in the very
Churches, where the Pari&s;h Mini&s;ters were either
Dead or fled, nor was there any Room for making
Difference, at &s;uch a Time as this was.</P>
<P>It was indeed a lamentable Thing to hear the mi&s;era|ble
Lamentations of poor dying Creatures, calling out
for Mini&s;ters to Comfort them, and pray with them, to
Coun&s;el them, and to direct them, calling out to God
for Pardon and Mercy, and confe&s;&s;ing aloud their pa&s;t
Sins. It would make the &s;toute&s;t Heart bleed to hear
how many Warnings were then given by dying Peni|tenrs,
to others not to put off and delay their Repen|tance
to the Day of Di&s;tre&s;s, that &s;uch a Time of Cala|mity
as this, was no Time for Repentance; was no
Time to call upon God. I wi&s;h I could repeat the very
Sound of tho&s;e Groans, and of tho&s;e Exclamations that
I heard from &s;ome poor dying Creatures, when in the
Hight of their Agonies and Di&s;tre&s;s; and that I could
make him that read this hear, as I imagine I now hear
them, for the Sound &s;eems &s;till to Ring in my Ears. If</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="124">
If I could but tell this Part, in &s;uch moving Accents
as &s;hould alarm the very Soul of the Reader, I &s;hould
rejoice that I recorded tho&s;e Things, however &s;hort and
imperfect.</P>
<P>It plea&s;ed God that I was &s;till &s;par'd, and very
hearty and &s;ound in Health, but very impatient of be|ing
pent up within Doors without Air, as I had been
for 14 Days or thereabouts; and I could not re&s;train
my &s;elf, but I would go to carry a Letter for my Bro|ther
to the Po&s;t-Hou&s;e; then it was indeed, that I
ob&s;erv'd a profound Silence in the Streets; when I came
to the Po&s;t-Hou&s;e, as I went to put in my Let|ter,
I &s;aw a Man &s;tand in one Corner of the Yard, and
talking to another at a Window; and a third had o|pen'd
a Door belonging to the Office; In the middle
of the Yard lay a &s;mall Leather Pur&s;e, with two Keys
hanging at it, and Money in it, but no Body would
meddle with it: I ask'd how long it had lain there;
the Man at the Window &s;aid, it had lain almo&s;t an
Hour; but that they had not meddled with it, becau&s;e
they did not know, but the Per&s;on who dropt it,
might come back to look for it. I had no &s;uch need
of Money, nor was the Sum &s;o big, that I had any In|clination
to meddle with it, or to get the Money at
the hazard it might be attended with; &s;o I &s;eem'd to
go away, when the Man who had open'd the Door, &s;aid,
he would take it up; but &s;o, that if the right Own|er
came for it, he &s;hould be &s;ure to have it: So he went
in, and fetched a pail of Water, and &s;et it down hard by
the Pur&s;e; then went again, and fetch'd &s;ome Gun-pow|der,
and ca&s;t a good deal of Powder upon the Pur&s;e,
and then made a Train from that which he had
thrown loo&s;e upon the Pur&s;e; the train reached about
two Yards; after this he goes in a third Time, and
fetches out a pair of Tongues red hot, and which
he had prepar'd, I &s;uppo&s;e on purpo&s;e; and fir&s;t &s;et|ting
Fire to the Train of Powder, that &s;ing'd the
Pur&s;e and al&s;o &s;moak'd the Air &s;ufficiently: But he
was not content with that; but he then takes up
<PB N="123" REF="125">
the Pur&s;e with the Tongs, holding it &s;o long till the
Tongs burnt thro' the Pur&s;e, and then he &s;hook the
Money out into the Pail of Water, &s;o he carried it in.
The Money, as I remember, was about thirteen Shil|lings,
and &s;ome &s;mooth Groats, and Bra&s;s Farthings.</P>
<P>There might perhaps, have been &s;everal poor Peo|ple,
<HI>as I have ob&s;erv'd above,</HI> that would have been hardy
enough to have ventured for the &s;ake of the Money;
but you may ea&s;ily &s;ee by what I have ob&s;erv'd, that
the few People, who were &s;par'd, were very careful of
them&s;elves, at that Time when the Di&s;tre&s;s was &s;o
exceeding great.</P>
<P>Much about the &s;ame Time I walk'd out into the
Fields towards <HI>Bow;</HI> for I had a great mind to &s;ee
how things were managed in the River, and among
the Ships; and as I had &s;ome Concern in Shipping, I
had a Notion that it had been one of the be&s;t Ways
of &s;ecuring ones &s;elf from the Infection to have retir'd
into a Ship, and mu&s;ing how to &s;atisfy my Curio&s;ity,
in that Point, I turned away over the Fields, from
<HI>Bow</HI> to <HI>Bromley,</HI> and down to <HI>Blackwall,</HI> to the Stairs,
which are there for landing, or taking Water.</P>
<P>Here I &s;aw a poor Man walking on the Bank, or
Sea-wall, as they call it, by him&s;elf, I walked a while
al&s;o about, &s;eeing the Hou&s;es all &s;hut up; at la&s;t I fell
into &s;ome Talk, at a Di&s;tance, with this poor Man;
fir&s;t I asked him, how People did thereabouts? <HI>Alas,
Sir!</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>almo&s;t all de&s;olate; all dead or &s;ick: Here are
very few Families in this Part, or in that Village,</HI> pointing
at <HI>Poplar, where half of them are not dead already, and the
re&s;t &s;ick.</HI> Then he pointed to one Hou&s;e, <HI>There they are
all dead,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>and the Hou&s;e &s;tands open; no Body dares
go into it. A poor Thief,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>ventured in to &s;teal &s;ome|thing,
but he paid dear for his Theft; for he was carried to
the Church Yard too, la&s;t Night.</HI> Then he pointed to &s;e|veral
other Hou&s;es. <HI>There,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>they are all dead; the
Man and his Wife, and five Children. There,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>they
are &s;hut up, you &s;ee a Watchman at the Door;</HI> and &s;o of o|ther
Hou&s;es. <HI>Why,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>What do you here all alone?
<PB N="124" REF="126">
Why,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I am a poor de&s;olate</HI> Man; <HI>it has plea&s;ed God I
am not yet vi&s;ited, tho' my Family is, and one of my Children
dead. How do you mean then,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>that you are not
vi&s;ited. Why,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that's my Hou&s;e,</HI> pointing to a
very little low boarded Hou&s;e, <HI>and there my poor Wife
and two Children live,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>if they may be &s;aid to
live,; for my Wife and one of the Children are vi&s;ited, but
I do not come at them.</HI> And with that Word I &s;aw the
Tears run very plentifully down his Face; and &s;o
they did down mine too, I a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>But &s;aid I, <HI>Why do you not come at them? How can you
abandon your own Fle&s;h, and Blood? Oh, Sir!</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>the
Lord forbid; I do not abandon them; I work for them as
much as I am able; and ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, I keep them
from Want;</HI> and with that I ob&s;erv'd, he lifted up
his Eyes to Heaven, with a Countenance that pre&s;ent|ly
told me, I had happened on a Man that was no Hy|pocrite,
but a &s;erious, religious good Man, and his
Ejaculation was an Expre&s;&s;ion of Thankfulne&s;s, that
in &s;uch a Condition as he was in, he &s;hould be able
to &s;ay his Family did not want. <HI>Well,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>ho|ne&s;t
Man, that is a great Mercy as things go now with the
Poor: But how do you live then, and how are you kept from
the dreadful Calamity that is now upon us all? Why Sir,</HI>
&s;ays he, <HI>I am a Waterman, and there's my Boat,</HI> &s;ays he,
<HI>and the Boat &s;eves me for a Hou&s;e; I work in it in the
Day, and I &s;leep in it in the Night; and what I get, I lay
down upon that Stone,</HI> &s;ays he, &s;hewing me a broad Stone
on the other Side of the Street, a good way from his
Hou&s;e, <HI>and then,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I halloo, and call to them till
I make them hear; and they come and fetch it.</HI></P>
<P>Well Friend, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> but how can you get any Money as a
Waterman? does any Body go by Water the&s;e Times? Yes
Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> in the Way I am employ'd there does. Do you
&s;ee there, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> five Ships lie at Anchor, <HI>pointing down
the River, a good way below the Town,</HI> and do you
&s;ee, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> eight or ten Ships lie at the Chain, there,
and at Anchor yonder, <HI>pointing above the Town.</HI> All
tho&s;e Ships have Families on board, of their Merchants
<PB N="125" REF="127">
and Owners, and &s;uch like, who have lock'd them&s;elves
up, and live on board, clo&s;e &s;hut in, for fear of the Infecti|on;
and I tend on them to fetch Things for them, carry
Letters, and do what is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that they may
not be obliged to come on Shore; and every Night I fa&s;ten
my Boat on board one of the Ship's Boats, and there I &s;leep
by my &s;elf, and ble&s;&s;ed be God, I am pre&s;erv'd hitherto.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> Friend, but will they let you come on board,
after you have been on Shore here, when this is &s;uch a ter|rible
Place, and &s;o infected as it is?</P>
<P>Why, as to that, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> I very &s;eldom go up the Ship
Side, but deliver what I bring to their Boat, or lie by the
Side, and they hoi&s;t it on board; if I did, I think they are
in no Danger from me, for I never go into any Hou&s;e on
Shore, or touch any Body, no, not of my own Family; But
I fetch Provi&s;ions for them.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> but that may be wor&s;e, for you mu&s;t have
tho&s;e Provi&s;ions of &s;ome Body or other; and &s;ince all this
Part of the Town is &s;o infected, it is dangerous &s;o much as
to &s;peak with any Body; for this Village, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> is as it
were, the Beginning of <HI>London,</HI> tho' it be at &s;ome Di&s;tance
from it.</P>
<P>That is true, <HI>added</HI> he, but you do not under&s;tand me
Right, I do not buy Provi&s;ions for them here; I row up
to <HI>Greenwich</HI> and buy fre&s;h Meat there, and &s;ometimes I
row down the River to <HI>Woolwich</HI> and buy there; then I
go to &s;ingle Farm Hou&s;es on the Kenti&s;h Side, where I am
known, and buy Fowls and Eggs, and Butter, and bring
to the Ships, as they direct me, &s;ometimes one, &s;ometimes the
other; I &s;eldom come on Shore here; and I came now only
to call to my Wife, and hear how my little Family do, and
give them a little Money, which I receiv'd la&s;t Night.</P>
<P>Poor Man! <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and how much ha&s;t thou gotten for
them?</P>
<P>I have gotten four Shillings, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> which is a great
Sum, as things go now with poor Men; but they have given
me a Bag of Bread too, and a Salt Fi&s;h and &s;ome Fle&s;h;
&s;o all helps out.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="128">
Well, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> and have you given it them yet?</P>
<P>No, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> but I have called, and my Wife has an|&s;wered,
that &s;he cannot come out yet, but in Half an Hour
&s;he hopes to come, and I am waiting for her: Poor Woman!
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> &s;he is brought &s;adly down; &s;he has a Swelling, and
it is broke, and I hope &s;he will recover; but I fear the Child
will die; but <HI>it is the Lord!&mdash;Here he &s;topt,
and wept very much.</HI></P>
<P>Well, hone&s;t Friend, <HI>&s;aid I,</HI> thou ha&s;t a &s;ure Comforter,
if thou ha&s;t brought thy &s;elf to be re&s;ign'd to the will of God,
he is dealing with us all in Judgment.</P>
<P>Oh, Sir, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> it is infinite Mercy, if any of us are
&s;par'd; and who am I to repine!</P>
<P><HI>Saye&s;t thou &s;o,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>and how much le&s;s is my Faith
than thine?</HI> And here my Heart &s;mote me, &s;ugge&s;ting
how muth better this Poor Man's Foundation was,
on which he &s;taid in the Danger, than mine; that
he had no where to fly; that he had a Family to bind
him to Attendance, which I had not; and mine was
meer Pre&s;umption, his a true Dependance, and a Cou|rage
re&s;ting on God: and yet, that he u&s;ed all po&s;|&s;ible
Caution for his Safety.</P>
<P>I turn'd a little way from the Man, while the&s;e
Thoughts engaged me, for indeed, I could no more
refrain from Tears than he.</P>
<P>At length, after &s;ome farther Talk, the poor Wo|man
opened the Door, and call'd, <HI>Robert, Robert;</HI> he
an&s;wered and bid her &s;tay a few Moments, and he
would come; &s;o he ran down the common Stairs to
his Boat, and fetch'd up a Sack in which was the Pro|vi&s;ions
he had brought from the Ships; and when he
returned, he hallooed again; then he went to the great
Stone which he &s;hewed me, and emptied the Sack,
and laid all out, every Thing by them&s;elves, and then
retired; and his Wife came with a little Boy to
fetch them away; and he called, and &s;aid, &s;uch a
Captain had &s;ent &s;uch a Thing, and &s;uch a Captain
&s;uch a Thing, and at the End adds, <HI>God has &s;ent it all,
<PB N="127" REF="129">
give Thanks to him.</HI> When the Poor Woman had taken
up all, &s;he was &s;o weak, &s;he could not carry it at once
in, <HI>tho' the Weight was not much neither;</HI> &s;o &s;he left the
Bi&s;cuit which was in a little Bag, and left a little
Boy to watch it till &s;he came again.</P>
<P>Well, but <HI>&s;ays I to him,</HI> did you leave her the four
Shillings too, which you &s;aid was your Week's Pay?</P>
<P>YES, YES, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> you &s;hall hear her own it. <HI>So he
calls again,</HI> Rachel, Rachel, <HI>which it &s;eems was her
Name,</HI> did you take up the Money? YES, <HI>&s;aid &s;he.</HI> How
much was it, <HI>&s;aid he?</HI> Four Shillings and a Groat, <HI>&s;aid
&s;he.</HI> Well, well, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> the Lord keep you all; <HI>and &s;o
he turned to go away.</HI></P>
<P>As I could not refrain contributing Tears to this
Man's Story, &s;o neither could I refrain my Charity
for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;o I call'd him, <HI>Hark thee Friend,</HI>
&s;aid I, <HI>come hither; for I believe thou art in Health, that
I may venture thee;</HI> &s;o I pull'd out my Hand, which was
in my Pocket before, <HI>here,</HI> &s;ays I, <HI>go and call thy</HI> Ra|chel
<HI>once more, and give her a little more Comfort from me.
God will never for&s;ake a Family that tru&s;t in him as thou
do&s;t;</HI> &s;o I gave him four other Shillings, and bad
him go lay them on the Stone and call his Wife.</P>
<P>I have not Words to expre&s;s the poor Man's thank|fulne&s;s,
neither could he expre&s;s it him&s;elf; but by
Tears running down his Face; he call'd his Wife, and
told her God had mov'd the Heart of a Stranger upon
hearing their Condition, to give them all that Money;
and a great deal more &s;uch as that, he &s;aid to her. The
Woman too, made Signs of the like Thankfulne&s;s, as
well to Heaven, as to me, and joyfully pick'd it up;
and I parted with no Money all that Year, that I
thought better be&s;tow'd.</P>
<P>I then ask'd the poor Man if the Di&s;temper had
not reach'd to <HI>Greenwich:</HI> He &s;aid it had not, till about
a Fortnight before; but that then he feared it had;
but that it was only at that End of the Town, which
lay South towards <HI>Deptford</HI>-Bridge; that he went on|ly
to a Butchers-Shop, and a Grocers, where he gene|rally
<PB N="128" REF="130">
bought &s;uch Things as they &s;ent him for; but
was very careful.</P>
<P>I ask'd him then, how it came to pa&s;s, that tho&s;e
People who had &s;o &s;hut them&s;elves up in the Ships,
had not laid in &s;ufficint Stores of all things nece&s;&s;a|ry?
He &s;aid &s;ome of them had, but on the other
Hand, &s;ome did not come on board till they were fright|ed
into it, and till it was too dangerous for them to
go to the proper People, to lay in Quantities of Things,
and that he waited on two Ships which he &s;hewed
me, that had lay'd in little or nothing but Bi&s;cuit
Bread, and Ship Beer; and that he had bought every
Thing el&s;e almo&s;t for them. I ask'd him, if there
was any more Ships that had &s;eparated them&s;elves,
as tho&s;e had done. He told me yes, all the way up
from the Point, right again&s;t <HI>Greenwich,</HI> to within the
Shore of <HI>Lime hou&s;e</HI> and <HI>Redriff,</HI> all the Ships that could
have Room, rid two and two in the middle of the
Stream; and that &s;ome of them had &s;everal Families
on Board, I ask'd him, if the Di&s;temper had not reach|ed
them? He &s;aid he believ'd it had not, except two
or three Ships, who&s;e People had not been &s;o watch|ful,
to keep the Seamen from going on Shore as others
had been; and he &s;aid it was a very fine Sight to &s;ee how
the Ships lay up the Pool.</P>
<P>When he &s;aid he was going over to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> as
&s;oon as the Tide began to come in. I ask'd if he
would let me go with him, and bring me back, for
that, I had a great mind to &s;ee how the Ships were
ranged as he had told me? He told me if I would a&s;|&s;ure
him on the Word of a Chri&s;tian, and of an hone&s;t
Man, that I had not the Di&s;temper, he would: I
a&s;&s;ur'd him, that I had not, that it had plea&s;ed God
to pre&s;erve me, That I liv'd in <HI>White-Chapel,</HI> but was
too Impatient of being &s;o long within Doors, and that
I had ventured out &s;o far for the Refre&s;hment of a little
Air; but that none in my Hou&s;e had &s;o much as been
touch't with it.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="131">
Well, Sir, &s;ays he, as your Charity has been mov'd
to pity me and my poor Family; &s;ure you cannot
have &s;o little pity left, as to put your &s;elf into my
Boat if you were not Sound in Health, which would
be nothing le&s;s than killing me, and ruining my whole
Family. The poor Man troubled me &s;o much, when he
&s;poke of his Family with &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible Concern,
and in &s;uch an affectionate Manner, that I cou'd not
&s;atisfy my &s;elf at fir&s;t to go at all. I told him, I
would lay a&s;ide my Curio&s;ity, rather than make him
unea&s;y; tho' I was &s;ure, and very thankful for it,
that I had no more Di&s;temper upon me, than the
fre&s;he&s;t Man in the World: <HI>Well,</HI> he would not have
me put it off neither, but to let me &s;ee how confident
he was, that I was ju&s;t to him, he now importun|ed
me to go; &s;o when the Tide came up to his
Boat, I went in, and he carry'd me to <HI>Greenwich:</HI>
While he bought the Things which he had in his
Charge to buy, I walk'd up to the Top of the Hill,
under which the Town &s;tands, and on the Ea&s;t-Side
of the Town, to get a Pro&s;pect of the River: But
it was a &s;urpri&s;ing Sight to &s;ee the Number of Ships
which lay in Rows, two and two, and &s;ome Places,
two or three &s;uch Lines in the Breadth of the River,
and this not only up quite to the Town, between the
Hou&s;es which we call <HI>Ratclif</HI> and <HI>Redriff,</HI> which they
name the <HI>Pool,</HI> but even down the whole River, as
far as the Head of <HI>Long-Reach,</HI> which is as far as the
Hills give us Leave to &s;ee it.</P>
<P>I cannot gue&s;s at the Number of Ships, but I think
there mu&s;t be &s;everal Hundreds of Sail; and I could
not but applaud the Contrivance, for ten thou&s;and
People, and more, who attended Ship Affairs, were
certainly &s;heltered here from the Violence of the Con|tagion,
and liv'd very &s;afe and very ea&s;y.</P>
<P>I returned to my own Dwelling very well &s;atisfied
with my Days Journey, and particularly with the
poor Man; al&s;o I rejoyced to &s;ee that &s;uch little San|ctuaries
were provided for &s;o many Families, in a Time
<PB N="130" REF="132">
of &s;uch De&s;olation. I ob&s;erv'd al&s;o, that as the Vio|lence
of the Plague had encrea&s;ed, &s;o the Ships which
had Families on Board, remov'd and went farther
off, till, as I was told, &s;ome went quite away to Sea,
and put into &s;uch Harbours, and &s;afe Roads on the
<HI>North</HI> Coa&s;t, as they could be&s;t come at.</P>
<P>But it was al&s;o true, that all the People, who thus
left the Land, and liv'd on Board the Ships, were not
entirely &s;afe from the Infection, for many died, and
were thrown over-board into the River, &s;ome in Cof|fins,
and &s;ome, as I heard, without Coffins, who&s;e
Bodies were &s;een &s;ometimes to drive up and down,
with the Tide in the River.</P>
<P>But I believe, I may venture to &s;ay, that in tho&s;e
Ships which were thus infected, it either happened
where the People had recour&s;e to them too late, and
did not fly to the Ship till they had &s;tayed too long
on Shore, and had the Di&s;temper upon them, tho'
perhaps, they might not perceive it, and &s;o the
Di&s;temper did not come to them, on Board the Ships,
but they really carried it with them; OR it was
in the&s;e Ships, where the poor Waterman &s;aid they
had not had Time to furni&s;h them&s;elves with Provi|&s;ions,
but were obliged to &s;end often on Shore to
buy what they had Occa&s;ion for, or &s;uffered Boats
to come to them from the Shore; and &s;o the Di&s;tem|per
was brought in&s;en&s;ibly among them.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but take notice that the &s;trange
Temper of the People of <HI>London</HI> at that Time contri|tributed
extremely to their own De&s;truction. The
Plague began, as I have ob&s;erved, at the other End
of the Town, namely, in <HI>Long-Acre, Drury-Lane, &amp;c.</HI>
and came on towards the City very gradually and
&s;lowly. It was felt at fir&s;t in <HI>December,</HI> then again in
<HI>February,</HI> then again in <HI>April,</HI> and always but a very
little at a Time; then it &s;top till <HI>May,</HI> and even the
la&s;t Week in <HI>May,</HI> there was but 17, and all at that
End of the Town; and all this while, even &s;o long,
as till there died above 3000 a-Week; yet had the
<PB N="131" REF="133">
People in <HI>Redriff,</HI> and in <HI>Wapping,</HI> and <HI>Ratcliff</HI> on
both Sides the River, and almo&s;t all <HI>Southwark-Side,</HI>
a mighty Fancy, that they &s;hould not be vi&s;ited, or
at lea&s;t, that it would not be &s;o violent among them.
Some People fancied, the &s;mell of the Pitch and Tar,
and &s;uch other things, as Oil and Ro&s;in, and Brim|&s;tone,
which is &s;o much u&s;ed by all Trades relating
to Shipping, would pre&s;erve them. Others argued
it, becau&s;e it was in its extreame&s;t Violence in <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter,</HI>
and the Pari&s;hes of St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s and St. <HI>An|drew</HI>'s,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and began to abate again, before it came
among them, which was true indeed, in Part: <HI>For
Example.</HI></P>

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> That it was ob&s;erv'd the Numbers mention'd
in <HI>Stepney</HI> Pari&s;h, at that time, were generally all on that
Side where <HI>Stepney</HI> Pari&s;h joined to <HI>Shoreditch,</HI> which
we now call <HI>Spittle-fields,</HI> where the Pari&s;h of <HI>Stepney;</HI>
comes up to the very Wall of <HI>Shoreditch</HI> Church-Yard,
and the Plague at this Time was abated at St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s
<HI>in the Fields,</HI> and raged mo&s;t violently in <HI>Cripplegate,
Bi&s;hop&s;gate</HI> and <HI>Shoreditch</HI> Pari&s;hes, but there was not
10 People a-Week that died of it in all that Part of

till after the whole Month of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> was expired; but
they paid for it afterwards, as I &s;hall ob&s;erve by and by.</P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, made the People of <HI>Redriff</HI> and <HI>Wap|ping,
Ratcliff</HI> and <HI>Lime-Hou&s;e</HI> &s;o &s;ecure, and flatter them|&s;elves
<PB N="132" REF="134">
&s;o much with the Plague's going off, without
reaching them, that they took no Care, either to fly
into the Country, or &s;hut them&s;elves up; nay, &s;o
far were they from &s;tirring, that they rather receiv'd
their Friends and Relations from the City into their
Hou&s;es; and &s;everal from other Places really took
Sanctuary in that Part of the Town, as a Place of
Safety, and as a Place which they thought God
would pa&s;s over and not vi&s;it as the re&s;t was vi&s;ited.</P>
<P>And this was the Rea&s;on, that when it came up|on
them they were more &s;urprized, more unprovided
and more at a Lo&s;s what to do than they were in
other Places, for when it came among them really,
and with Violence, as it did indeed, in <HI>September</HI> and
<HI>October,</HI> there was then no &s;tirring out into the Coun|try,
no Body would &s;uffer a Stranger to come near
them, no nor near the Towns where they dwelt; and
as I have been told, &s;everal that wandred into the
Country on <HI>Surry</HI> Side were found &s;tarv'd to Death in
the Woods and Commons, that Country being more
open and more woody, than any other Part &s;o near
<HI>London;</HI> e&s;pecially about <HI>Norwood,</HI> and the Pari&s;hes of
<HI>Camberwell, Dullege,</HI> and <HI>Lu&s;um,</HI> where it &s;eems no Bo|dy
dur&s;t relieve the poor di&s;tre&s;s'd People for fear of
the Infection.</P>
<P>This Notion having, as I &s;aid, prevailed with the
People in that Part of the Town, was in Part the Oc|ca&s;ion,
<HI>as I &s;aid before,</HI> that they had Recour&s;e to Ships
for their Retreat; and where they did this early, and
with Prudence, furni&s;hing them&s;elves &s;o with Provi|&s;ions,
that they had no need to go on Shore for Sup|plies,
or &s;ufter Boats to come on Board to bring them;
I &s;ay where they did &s;o they had certainly the &s;af|e&s;t
Retreat of any People what&s;oever: But the Di|&s;tre&s;s
was &s;uch, that People ran on Board in their
Fright without Bread to eat, and &s;ome into Ships,
that had no Men on Board to remove them farther
off, or to take the Boat and go down the River to
buy Provi&s;ions where it might be done &s;afely; and
<PB N="133" REF="135">
the&s;e often &s;uffered, and were infected on board as
much as on Shore.</P>
<P>As the richer Sort got into Ships, &s;o the lower Rank
got into Hoys, Smacks, Lighters, and Fi&s;hing-boats;
and many, e&s;pecially Watermen, lay in their Boats;
but tho&s;e made &s;ad Work of it, e&s;pecially the latter,
for going about for Provi&s;ion, and perhaps to get their
Sub&s;i&s;tence, the Infection got in among them and made
a fearful Havock; many of the Watermen died alone
in their Wherries, as they rid at their Roads, as well
above-Bridge as below, and were not found &s;ometimes
till they were not in Condition for any Body to touch
or come near them.</P>
<P>Indeed the Di&s;tre&s;s of the People at this Sea-faring
End of the Town was very deplorable, and de&s;erved
the greate&s;t Commi&s;eration: But alas! this was a
a Time when every one's private Safety lay &s;o near
them, that they had no Room to pity the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es
of others; for every one had Death, as it were, at his
Door, and many even in their Families, and knew not
what to do, or whither to fly.</P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, took away all Compa&s;&s;ion; &s;elf Pre|&s;ervation
indeed appear'd here to be the fir&s;t Law.
For the Children ran away from their Parents, as
they laugui&s;hed in the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s: And in &s;ome
Places, tho' not &s;o frequent as the other, Parents did
the like to their Children; nay, &s;ome dreadful Ex|amples
there were, and particularly two in one Week
of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Mothers, raveing and di&s;tracted, killing
their own Children; one whereof was not far off from
where I dwelt; the poor lunatick Creature not liv|ing
her&s;elf long enough to be &s;en&s;ible of the Sin of
what &s;he had done, much le&s;s to be puni&s;h'd for it.</P>
<P>It is not indeed to be wondred at, for the Danger of
immediate Death to our&s;elves, took away all Bowels
of Love, all Concern for one another: I &s;peak in ge|neral,
for there were many In&s;tances of immovable
Affection, Pity, and Duty in many, and &s;ome that
came to my Knowledg; that is to &s;ay, by here-&s;ay:</P>
<P>For I &s;hall not take upon me to vouch the Truth of
the Particulars.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136">
To introduce one, let me fir&s;t mention, that one
of the mo&s;t deplorable Ca&s;es, in all the pre&s;ent Cala|mity,
was, that of Women with Child; who when
they came to the Hour of their Sorrows, and their
Pains came upon them, cou'd neither have help of one
Kind or another; neither Midwife or Neigbouring
Women to come near them; mo&s;t of the Midwives
were dead; e&s;pecially, of &s;uch as &s;erv'd the poor;
and many, if not all the Midwives of Note were fled
into the Country: So that it was next to impo&s;&s;ible
for a poor Woman that cou'd not pay an immoderate
Price to get any Midwife to come to her, and if they
did, tho&s;e they cou'd get were generally unskilful
and ignorant Creatures; and the Con&s;equence of
this was, that a mo&s;t unu&s;ual and incredible Number
of Women were reduc'd to the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. Some
were deliver'd and &s;poil'd by the ra&s;hne&s;s and igno|rance
of tho&s;e who pretended to lay them. Children
without Number, were, I might &s;ay murtherd by
the &s;ame, but a more ju&s;tifiable ignorance, pretending
they would &s;ave the Mother, whatever became of
the Child; and many Times, both Mother and Child
were lo&s;t in the &s;ame Manner; and e&s;pecially, where
the Mother had the Di&s;temper, there no Body would
come near them, and both &s;ometimes peri&s;h'd: Some|times
the Mother has died of the Plague; and the
Infant, it may be half born, or born but not parted
from the Mother. Some died in the very Pains of
their Travel, and not deliver'd at all; and &s;o many
were the Ca&s;es of this Kind, that it is hard to Judge
of them.</P>
<P>Something of it will appear in the unu&s;ual Num|bers
which are put into the Weekly Bills (tho' I am
far from allowing them to be able to give any Thing
of a full Account) under the Articles of
<Q><L>Child-Bed.</L>

This inequallity, I &s;ay, is exceedingly augmented,
when the Numbers of People are con&s;idered: I pre|tend
not to make any exact Calculation of the Num|bers
of People, which were at this Time in the City;
but I &s;hall make a probable Conjecture at that part
by and by: What I have &s;aid now, is to explain the
mi&s;ery of tho&s;e poor Creatures above; &s;o that it might
well be &s;aid as in the Scripture. <HI>Wo! be to tho&s;e who
are with Child; and to tho&s;e which give &s;uch in that Day.</HI>
For indeed, it was a Wo to them in particular.</P>
<P>I was not conver&s;ant in many particlar Families
where the&s;e things happen'd; but the Out-cries of
the mi&s;erable, were heard afar off. As to tho&s;e who
were with Child, we have &s;een &s;ome Calculation
made 291 Women dead in Child bed in nine Weeks;
out of one third Part of the Number, of whom there
u&s;ually dy'd in that Time, but 48 of the &s;ame Di&s;|a&s;ter.
Let the Reader calculate the Proportion.</P>
<P>There is no Room to doubt, but the Mi&s;ery of tho&s;e
that gave Suck, was in Proportion as great&punc; Our
Bills of Mortality cou'd give but little Light in this;
yet, &s;ome it did, there were &s;everal more than u&s;ual
&s;tarv'd at Nur&s;e, But this was nothing: The Mi&s;ery
was, where they were (<HI>1&s;t</HI>) &s;tarved for want of a
Nur&s;e, the Mother dying, and all the Family and the
Infants found dead by them, meerly for want; and
if I may &s;peak my Opinion, I do believe, that many
hundreds of Poor helple&s;s Infants peri&s;h'd in this man|ner.
<HI>(2dly)</HI> Not &s;tarved (but poi&s;on'd) by the Nur&s;e,
Nay even where the Mother has been Nur&s;e, and
having receiv'd the Infection, has poi&s;on'd, that is,
infected the Infant with her Milk, even before they
knew they were infected them&s;elves; nay, and the In|fant
has dy'd in &s;uch a Ca&s;e before the Mother. I can|not
but remember to leave this Admonition upon Re|cord,
if ever &s;uch another dreadful Vi&s;itation &s;hould
happen in this City; that all Women that are with Child
or that give Suck &s;hould be gone, if they have any po|&s;ible
<PB N="137" REF="139">
Means out of the Place; becau&s;e their Mi&s;ery
if infected, will &s;o much exceed all other Peoples.</P>
<P>I could tell here di&s;mal Stories of living Infants be|ing
found &s;ucking the Brea&s;ts of their Mothers, or
Nur&s;es, after they have been dead of the Plague. Of
a Mother, in the Pari&s;h where I liv'd, who having a
Child that was not well, &s;ent for an Apothecary to
View the Child, and when he came, as the Relation
goes, was giving the Child &s;uck at her Brea&s;t, and
to all Appearance, was her &s;elf very well: But when
the Apothecary came clo&s;e to her, he &s;aw the To|kens
upon that Brea&s;t, with which &s;he was &s;uckling
the Child. He was &s;urpriz'd enough to be &s;ure;
but not willing to fright the poor Woman too much,
he de&s;ired the would give the Child into his Hand;
&s;o he takes the Child, and going to a Cradle in the
Room lays it in, and opening its Cloths, found the
Tokens upon the Child too, and both dy'd before he
cou'd get Home, to &s;end a preventative Medicine to
the Father of the Child, to whom he had told their
Condition; whether the Child infected the Nur&s;e-Mother,
or the Mother the Child was not certain,
but the la&s;t the mo&s;t likely.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e of a Child brought Home to the Parents
from a Nur&s;e that had dy'd of the Plague; yet, the
tender Mother would not refu&s;e to take in her Child,
and lay'd it in her Bo&s;om, by which &s;he was infected,
and dy'd with the Child in her Arms dead al&s;o.</P>
<P>It would make the harde&s;t Heart move at the In|&s;tances
that were frequently found of tender Mothers,
tending and watching with their dear Children, and
even dying before them, and &s;ometimes taking the
Di&s;temper from them, and dying when the Child, for
whom the affectionate Heart had been &s;acrified, has
got over it and e&s;cap'd.</P>
<P>The like of a Trade&s;man in <HI>Ea&s;t-Smith-field,</HI> who&s;e
Wife was big with Child of her fir&s;t Child, and fell
in Labour, having the Plague upon her: He cou'd
neither get Midwife to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, or Nur&s;e to tend
<PB N="138" REF="140">
her; and two Servants which he kept fled both from
her. He ran from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e like one di&s;tract|ed,
but cou'd get no help; the utmo&s;t he could get
was, that a Watchman who attended at an infected
Hou&s;e &s;hut up, promis'd to &s;end a Nur&s;e in the Morn|ing:
The poor Man with his Heart broke, went
back, a&s;&s;i&s;ted his Wife what he cou'd, acted the part
of the Midwife; brought the Child dead into the
World; and his Wife in about an Hour dy'd in his
Arms, where he held her dead Body fa&s;t till the
Morning, when the Watchman came and brought the
Nur&s;e as he had promi&s;ed; and coming up the Stairs,
for he had left the Door open, or only latched:
They found the Man &s;itting with his dead Wife in
his Arms; and &s;o overwhelmed with Grief, that he
dy'd in a few Hours after, without any Sign of the
Infection upon him, but meerly &s;unk under the Weight
of his Grief.</P>
<P>I have heard al&s;o of &s;ome, who on the Death of
their Relations, have grown &s;tupid with the in&s;up|portable
Sorrow, and of one in particular, who was
&s;o ab&s;olutely overcome with the Pre&s;&s;ure upon his Spi|rits,
that by Degrees, his Head &s;unk into his Body,
&s;o between his Shoulders, that the Crown of his Head
was very little &s;een above the Bones of his Shoulders;
and by Degrees, lo&s;eing both Voice and Sen&s;e, his
Face looking forward, lay again&s;t his Collar-Bone,
and cou'd not be kept up any otherwi&s;e, unle&s;s held
up by the Hands of other People; and the poor Man
never came to him&s;elf again, but langui&s;hed near a
Year in that Condition and died: Nor was he ever
once &s;een to lift up his Eyes, or to look upon any
particular Object.</P>
<P>I cannot undertake to give any other than a Sum|mary
of &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages as the&s;e, becau&s;e it was not po|&s;ible
to come at the Particulars, where &s;ometimes
the whole Families, where &s;uch Things happen'd,
were carry'd off by the Di&s;temper: But there were
innumerable Ca&s;es of this Kind, which pre&s;ented to
<PB N="139" REF="141">
the Eye, and the Ear; even in pa&s;&s;ing along the Streets,
as I have hinted above, nor is it ea&s;y to give any
Story of this, or that Family, which there was not
divers parallel Stories to met with of the &s;ame Kind.</P>
<P>But as I am now talking of the Time, when the
Plague rag'd at the Ea&s;ter-mo&s;t Part of the Town;
how for a long Time the People of tho&s;e Parts
had flattered them&s;elves that they &s;hould e&s;cape; and
how they were &s;urprized, when it came upon them
as it did; for indeed, it came upon them like an arm|ed
Man, when it did come. I &s;ay, this brings me
back to the three poor Men, who wandered from
<HI>Wapping,</HI> not knowing whether to go, or what to do,
and who I mention'd before; one a Bi&s;cuit-Baker, one
a Sail-Maker, and the other a Joiner; all of <HI>Wapping,</HI>
or thereabouts&punc;</P>
<P>The Sleepine&s;s and Security of that Part as I have
ob&s;erv'd, was &s;uch; that they not only did not &s;hift
for them&s;elves as others did; but they boa&s;ted of be|ing
&s;afe. and of Safety being with them; and many
People fled out of the City, and out of the infected Su|burbs,
to <HI>Wapping, Ratcliff, Lime-hou&s;e, Poplar,</HI> and
&s;uch Places, as to Places of Security; and it is not at
all unlikely, that their doing this, help'd to bring
the Plague that way fa&s;ter, than it might otherwi&s;e
have come. For tho' I am much for Peoples flying
away and emptying &s;uch a Town as this, upon
the fir&s;t Appearance of a like Vi&s;itation, and that
all People that have any po&s;&s;ible Retreat, &s;hould
make u&s;e of it in Time, and begone; yet, I mu&s;t &s;ay,
when all that will fly are gone, tho&s;e that are left and
mu&s;t &s;tand it, &s;hould &s;tand &s;tock &s;till where they are,
and not &s;hift from one End of the Town, or one Part
of the Town to the other; for that is the Bane and
Mi&s;chief of the whole, and they carry the Plague
from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e in their very Clothes.</P>
<P>Wherefore, were we ordered to kill all the Dogs
and Cats: But becau&s;e as they were dome&s;tick Ani|mals,
<PB N="140" REF="142">
and are apt to run from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, and
from Street to Street; &s;o they are capable of carry|ing
the Effluvia or Infectious Steams of Bodies in|fected,
even in their Furrs and Hair; and therefore, it
was that in the beginning of the Infection, an Order
was publi&s;hed by the Lord Mayor, and by the Magi|&s;trates,
according to the Advice of the Phy&s;icians;
that all the Dogs and Cats &s;hould be imediately kil|led,
and an Officer was appointed for the Execution.</P>
<P>It is incredible, if their Account is to be depended
upon, what a prodigious Number of tho&s;e Creatures
were de&s;troy'd: I think they talk'd of forty thou&s;and
Dogs, and five times as many Cats, few Hou&s;es be|ing
without a Cat, and &s;ome having &s;everal, and &s;ome|times
five or fix in a Hou&s;e. All po&s;&s;ible Endeavours
were us'd al&s;o to de&s;troy the Mice and Rats, e&s;pe|cially
the latter; by laying Rats Bane, and other
Poi&s;ons for them, and a prodigious multitude of them
were al&s;o de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>I often reflected upon the unprovided Condition,
that the whole Body of the People were in at the
fir&s;t coming of this Calamity upon them, and how
it was for Want of timely entring into Mea&s;ures, and
Managements, as well publick as private, that all
the Confu&s;ions that followed were brought upon us&punc;
and that &s;uch a prodigious Number of People &s;unk
in that Di&s;a&s;ter, which if proper Steps had been
taken, might, Providence concurring, have been a|voided,
and which, if Po&s;terity think fit, they may
take a Caution, and Warning from: But I &s;hall come
to this Part again.</P>
<P>I come back to my three Men: Their Story has a
Moral in every Part of it, and their whole Conduct,
and that of &s;ome who they join'd with, is a Patern
for all poor Men to follow, or Women either, if ever
&s;uch a Time comes again; and if there was no other
End in recording it, I thing this a very ju&s;t one, whe|ther
my Account be exactly according to Fact or no.</P>
<P>Two of them are &s;aid to be Brothers, the one an
old Soldier, but now a Bi&s;cuit Baker; the other a
<PB N="141" REF="143">
lame Sailor, but now a Sail-Maker; the Third a
Joiner. Says <HI>John</HI> the Bi&s;cuit Baker, one Day to
<HI>Thomas</HI> his Brother, the Sail-maker, <HI>Brother</HI> Tom,
what will become of us? The Plague grows hot in the City,
and encrea&s;es this way: What &s;hall we do?</P>
<P>Truly, &s;ays Thomas, I am at a great Lo&s;s what to do,
for I find, if it comes down into <HI>Wapping,</HI> I &s;hall be turn'd
out of my Lodging: <HI>And thus they began to talk of it
beforehand.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> Turn'd out of your Lodging, <HI>Tom!</HI> if you are,
I don't know who will take you in; for People are &s;o afraid
of one another now, there's no getting a Lodging any where.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> Why? The People where I lodge are good civil
People, and have Kindne&s;s enough for me too; but they
&s;ay I go abroad every Day to my Work, and it will be dan|gerous;
and they talk of locking them&s;elves up, and letting
no Body come near them.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> Why, they are in the right to be &s;ure, if they re|&s;olve
to venture &s;taying in Town.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> Nay, I might e'en re&s;olve to &s;tay within Doors
too, for, except a Suit of Sails that my Ma&s;ter has in Hand,
and which I am ju&s;t a fini&s;hing, I am like to get no more
Work a great while; there's no Trade &s;tirs now; Work|men
and Servants are turned off every where, &s;o that I might
be glad to be lock'd up too: But I do not &s;ee they will be
willing to con&s;ent to that, any more than to the other.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> Why, what will you do then Brother? and what
&s;hall I do? for I am almo&s;t as bad as you; the People where
I lodge are all gone into the Country but a Maid, and &s;he is
to go next Week, and to &s;hut the Hou&s;e quite up, &s;o that I
&s;hall be turn'd a drift to the wide World before you, and I
am re&s;olved to go away too, if I knew but where to go.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> We were both di&s;tracted we did not go away at
f$$&s;t, then we might ha' travelled any where; there's no &s;tir|ring
now; we &s;hall be &s;tarv'd if we pretend to go out of
Town; they won't let us have Victuals, no, not for our
Money, nor let us come into the Towns, much le&s;s into their
Hou&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="144">
<HI>John,</HI> And that which is almo&s;t as bad, I have but little
Money to help my &s;elf with neither.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> As to that we might make &s;hift; I have a little,
tho' not much; but I tell you there's no &s;tirring on the Road&punc;
I know a Couple of poor hone&s;t Men in our Street have at|tempted
to travel, and at <HI>Barnet,</HI> or <HI>Whet&s;ton,</HI> or there
about, the People offered to fire at them if they pretended to
go forward; &s;o they are come back again quite di&s;courag'd.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> I would have ventured their Fire, if I had been
there; If I had been denied Food for my Money they &s;hould
ha' &s;een me take it before their Faces; and if I had ten|dred
Money for it, they could not have taken any Cour&s;e with
me by Law.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> You talk your old Soldier's Language, as if you
were in the <HI>Low-Countris</HI> now, but this is a &s;erious thing.
The People have good Rea&s;on to keep any Body off, that
they are not &s;atisfied are &s;ound, at &s;uch a Time as this;
and we mu&s;t not plunder them.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> No Brother, you mi&s;take the Ca&s;e, and mi&s;take
me too, I would plunder no Body; but for any Town upon
the Road to deny me Leave to pa&s;s thro' the Town in the
open High-Way, and deny me Provi&s;ions for my Money, is
to &s;ay the Town has a Right to &s;tarve me to Death, which
cannot be true.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> But they do not deny you Liberty to go back again
from whence you came, and therefore they do not &s;tarve you.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> But the next Town behind me will by the &s;ame
Rule deny me leave to go back, and &s;o they do &s;tarve me
between them; be&s;ides there is no Law to prohibit my travel|ling
wherever I will on the Road.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> But there will be &s;o much Difficulty in di&s;puting
with them at every Town on the Road, that it is not for
poor Men to do it, or to undertake it at &s;uch a Time as this
is e&s;pecially.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> Why Brother? Our Condition at this Rate is wor&s;e
than any Bodies el&s;e; for we can neither go away nor &s;tay
here; I am of the &s;ame Mind with the Lepers of <HI>Samaria,
If we &s;tay here we are &s;ure to die;</HI> I mean e&s;pecially,
as you and I are &s;tated, without a Dwelling-Hou&s;e of our
<PB N="143" REF="145">
own, and without Lodging in any Bodies el&s;e; there is no
lying in the Street at &s;uch a Time as this; we had as good
go into the Dead-Cart at once: Therefore I &s;ay, <HI>if we &s;tay
here we are &s;ure to die,</HI> and if we go away <HI>we can but
die:</HI> I am re&s;olv'd to be gone.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> You will go away: Whither will you go? and
what can you do? I would as willingly go away as you, if
I knew whither: But we have no Acquaintance, no Friends.
Here we were born, and here we mu&s;t die.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> Look you <HI>Tom,</HI> the whole Kingdom is my Na|tive
Country as well as this Town. You may as well &s;ay, I
mu&s;t not go out of my Hou&s;e if it is on Fire, as that I mu&s;t
not go out of the Town I was born in, when it is infected
with the Plague. I was born in <HI>England,</HI> and have a
Right to live in it if I can.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> But you know every vagrant Per&s;on may by the
Laws of <HI>England,</HI> be taken up, and pa&s;s'd back to their
la&s;t legal Settlement.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> But how &s;hall they make me vagrant; I de&s;ire only
to travel on, upon my lawful Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> What lawful Occa&s;ions can we pretend to tra|vel,
or rather wander upon, they will not be put off with
Words.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> Is not flying to &s;ave our Lives, a Lawful Oc|ca&s;ion!
and do they not all know that the Fact is true: We
cannot be &s;aid to di&s;&s;emble.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> But &s;uppo&s;e they let us pa&s;s, Whither &s;hall we go?</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> Any where to &s;ave our Lives: It is Time enough
to con&s;ider that when we are got out of this Town. If I am
once out of this dreadful Place I care not where I go.</P>
<P><HI>Tho.</HI> We &s;hall be driven to great Extremities. I know
not what to think of it.</P>
<P><HI>John,</HI> Well <HI>Tom,</HI> con&s;ider of it a little.</P>
<P>This was about the Beginning of <HI>July,</HI> and tho'
the Plague was come forward in the We&s;t and North
Parts of the Town, yet all <HI>Wapping,</HI> as I have ob|&s;erved
before, and <HI>Redriff,</HI> and <HI>Ratcliff,</HI> and <HI>Lime-Hou&s;e,</HI>
and <HI>Poplar,</HI> in &s;hort, <HI>Deptford</HI> and <HI>Greenwich,</HI>
<PB N="144" REF="146">
all both Sides of the River from the the <HI>Hermitage,</HI>
and from over again&s;t it, quite down to <HI>Blackwall,</HI>
was intirely free, there had not one Per&s;on died of
the Plague in all <HI>Stepney</HI> Pari&s;h, and not one on the
South Side of <HI>White Chappel</HI> Road, no, not in any
Pari&s;h&punc; and yet the Weekly Bill was that very Week
ri&s;en up to 1006.</P>
<P>It was a Fortnight after this, before the the two
Brothers met again, and then the Ca&s;e was a little
altered, and the Plague was &egrave;xceedingly advanced,
and the Number greatly encrea&s;ed, the Bill was up
at 2785, and prodigiou&s;ly encrea&s;ing, tho' &s;till both
Sides of the River, as below, kept pretty well: But
&s;ome began to die in <HI>Redriff,</HI> and about five or &s;ix
in <HI>Ratclif-High-Way,</HI> when the Sail Maker came
to his Brother <HI>John,</HI> expre&s;s, and in &s;ome Fright,
for he was ab&s;olutely warn'd out of his Lodging,
and had only a Week to provide him&s;elf. His Bro|ther
<HI>John</HI> was in as bad a Ca&s;e, for he was quite out,
and had only beg'd Leave of his Ma&s;ter the Bi&s;cuit
Baker to lodge in an Out-Hou&s;e belonging to his
Work-hou&s;e, where he only lay upon Straw, with
&s;ome Bi&s;cuit Sacks, or Bread-Sacks, as they call'd
them, laid upon it, and &s;ome of the &s;ame Sacks to
cover him.</P>
<P>Here they re&s;olved, &s;eeing all Employment being
at an End, and no Work, or Wages to he had, they
would make the be&s;t of their Way to get out of the
Reach of the dreadful Infection; and being as
good Husbands as they could, would endeavour to
live upon what they had as long as it would la&s;t,
and then work for more, if they could get Work any
where, of any Kind, let it be what it would.</P>
<P>While they were con&s;idering to put this Re&s;olu|tion
in Practice, in the be&s;t Manner they could,
the third Man, who was acquainted very well with
the Sail Maker, came to know of the De&s;ign, and
got Leave to be one of the Number, and thus they
prepared to &s;et out.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="147">
It happened that they had not an equal &s;hare of
Money, but as the Sail-maker, who had the be&s;t
Stock, was be&s;ides his being Lame, the mo&s;t unfit
to expect to get any thing by Working in the Coun|try,
&s;o he was content that what Money they had
&s;hould all go into one publick Stock, on Condition,
that whatever any one of them could gain more than
another, it &s;hould, without any grudging, be all ad|ded
to the &s;ame publick Stock.</P>
<P>They re&s;olv'd to load them&s;elves with as little
Baggage as po&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e they re&s;olv'd at fir&s;t to
travel on Foot; and to go a great way, that they
might, if po&s;&s;ible, be effectually Safe; and a great
many Con&s;ultations they had with them&s;elves, before
they could agree about what Way they &s;hould tra|vel,
which they were &s;o far from adju&s;ting, that even
to the Morning they &s;et out, they were not re&s;olv'd
on it.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the Seaman put in a Hint that determin'd
it; Fir&s;t, &s;ays he, the Weather is very hot, and there|fore
I am for travelling North, that we may not
have the Sun upon our Faces and beating on our
Brea&s;ts, which will heat and &s;uffocate us; and I have
been told, &s;ays he, that it is not good to over-heat
our Blood at a Time when, for ought we know, the
Infection may be in the very Air. In the next Place,
&s;ays he, I am for going the Way that may be con|trary
to the Wind as it may blow when we &s;et out,
that we may not have the Wind blow the Air of the
City on our Backs as we go. The&s;e two Cautions were
approv'd of; if it could be brought &s;o to hit, that the
Wind might not be in the South when they &s;et out
to go North.</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> the Baker, who had been a Soldier, then put
in his Opinion; Fir&s;t, &s;ays he, we none of us ex|pect
to get any Lodging on the Road, and it will
be a little too hard to lie ju&s;t in the open
Air; tho' it be warm Weather, yet it may be wet,
<PB N="146" REF="148">
and damp, and we have a double Rea&s;on to
take care of our Healths at &s;uch a time as this;
and therefore, &s;ays he, you, Brother <HI>Tom.</HI> that are
a Sail-maker, might ea&s;ily make us a little Tent,
and I will undertake to &s;et it up every Night, and
take it down, and a Fig for all the Inns in <HI>England;</HI>
if we have a good Tent over our Heads, we &s;hall do
well enough.</P>
<P>The Joyner oppos'd this, and told them, let them
leave that to him, he would undertake to build them
a Hou&s;e every Night with his Hatchet and Maller,
tho' he had no other Tools, which &s;hould be fully to
their &s;atisfaction, and as good as a Tent.</P>
<P>The Soldier and the Joyner di&s;puted that Point
&s;ome time, but at la&s;t the Soldier carry'd it for a
Tent; the only Objection again&s;t it was, that it
mu&s;t be carry'd with them, and that would encrea&s;e
their Baggage too much, the Weather heing hot; but
the Sail-maker had a piece of good Hap fell in which
made that ea&s;ie, for, his Ma&s;ter who he work'd for
having a Rope-Walk as well as his Sail-making
Trade, had a little poor Hor&s;e that he made no u&s;e
of then, and being willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t the three hone&s;t
Men, he gave them the Hor&s;e for the carrying their
Baggage; al&s;o for a &s;mall Matter of three Days Work
that his Man did for him before he went, he let him
have an old Top-gallant Sail that was worn out, but
was &s;ufficient and more than enough to make a very
good Tent: The Soldier &s;hew'd how to &s;hape it, and
they &s;oon by his Direction made their Tent. and fit|ted
it with Poles or Staves for the purpo&s;e, and thus
they were furni&s;h'd for their Journey; <HI>viz.</HI> three Men,
one Tent, one Hor&s;e, one Gun, for the Soldier would
not go without Arms, for now he &s;aid he was no
more a Bi&s;cuit-Baker, but a Trooper.</P>
<P>The Joyner had a &s;mall Bag of Tools, &s;uch as might
be u&s;eful if he &s;hould get any Work abroad, as well
for their Sub&s;i&s;tence as his own: What Money they
<PB N="147" REF="149">
had, they brought all into one publick Stock, and
thus they began their Journey. It &s;eems that in the
Morning when they &s;et out, the Wind blew as the
Saylor &s;aid by his Pocket Compa&s;s, at N. W. by W.
So they directed, or rather re&s;olv'd to direct their
Cour&s;e N. W.</P>
<P>But then a Difficulty came in their Way, that as
they &s;et out from the hither end of <HI>Wapping</HI> near
the <HI>Hermitage,</HI> and that the Plague was now very
Violent, e&s;pecially on the North &s;ide of the City&punc;
as in <HI>Shoreditch</HI> and <HI>Cripplegate</HI> Pari&s;h, they did not
think it &s;afe for them to go near tho&s;e Parts; &s;o
they went away Ea&s;t through <HI>Radcliff</HI> High-way, as
far as <HI>Radcliff-Cro&s;s,</HI> and leaving <HI>Stepney</HI> Church &s;till
on their Left-hand, being afraid to come up from
<HI>Radcliff-Cro&s;s</HI> to <HI>Mile-end,</HI> becau&s;e they mu&s;t come
ju&s;t by the Church-yard, and becau&s;e the Wind that
&s;eemed to blow more from the We&s;t, blow'd directly
from the &s;ide of the City where the Plague was hot|te&s;t.
So I &s;ay, leaving <HI>Stepney,</HI> they fetched a long
Compa&s;s, and going to <HI>Poplar</HI> and <HI>Bromley,</HI> came in|to
the great Road ju&s;t at <HI>Bow.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Watch plac'd upon <HI>Bow</HI> Bridge would
have que&s;tion'd them; but they cro&s;&s;ing the Road
into a narrow Way that turns out at the hither End
of the Town of <HI>Bow</HI> to <HI>Old-Ford,</HI> avoided any En|quiry
there, and travelled to <HI>Old-Ford.</HI> The Con|&s;tables
every where were upon their Guard, not &s;o
much it &s;eems to &s;top People pa&s;&s;ing by, as to &s;top
them from taking up their Abode in their Tow$s,
and withal becau&s;e of a Report that was newly
rais'd at that time, and that indeed was not very
improbable, <HI>viz.</HI> That the poor People in <HI>London</HI>
being di&s;tre&s;s'd and &s;tarv'd for want of Work, and by
that means for want of Bread, were up in Arms, and
had rai&s;ed a Tumult, and that they would come out
to all the Towns round to plunder for Bread. This,
I &s;ay, was only a Rumour, and it was very well it
<PB N="148" REF="150">
was no more; but it was not &s;o far off from being a
Reality, as it has been thought, for in a few Weeks
more the poor People became &s;o De&s;perate by the
Calamity they &s;uffer'd, that they were with great
difficulty kept from running out into the Fields
and Towns, and tearing all in pieces where-ever
they came; and, as I have ob&s;erved before, nothing
hinder'd them but that the Plague rag'd &s;o violent|ly,
and fell in upon them &s;o furiou&s;ly, that they ra|ther
went to the Grave by Thou&s;ands than into
the Fields in Mobs by Thou&s;ands: For in the Parts
about the Pari&s;hes of St. <HI>Sepulchres, Clerkenwell, Crip|plegate,
Bi&s;hep&s;gate</HI> and <HI>Shoreditch,</HI> which were the
Places where the Mob began to threaten, the Di|&s;temper
came on &s;o furiou&s;ly, that there died in tho&s;e
few Pari&s;hes, even then, before the Plague was come
to its height, no le&s;s than 5361 People in the fir&s;t
three Weeks in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> when at the &s;ame time, the Parts
about <HI>Wapping, Radcliffe,</HI> and <HI>Rotherhith,</HI> were, as
before de&s;crib'd, hardly touch'd, or but very light|ly;
&s;o that in a Word, tho', as I &s;aid before, the
good Management of the Lord Mayor and Ju&s;tices
did much to prevent the Rage and De&s;peration of
the People from breaking out in Rabbles and Tu|mults,
and in &s;hort, from the Poor plundering the
Rich; I &s;ay, tho' they did much, the Dead Carts
did more, for as I have &s;aid, that in five Pa|ri&s;hes
only there died above 5000 in 20 Days, &s;o
there might be probably three times that Number
Sick all that time; for &s;ome recovered, and great
Numbers fell &s;ick every Day and died afterwards.
Be&s;ides, I mu&s;t &s;till be allowed to &s;ay, that if the
Bills of Mortality &s;aid five Thou&s;and, I always be|liev'd
it was near twice as many in reality; there
being no room to believe that the Account they
gave was right, or that indeed, they were, among
&s;uch Confu&s;ions as I &s;aw them in, in any Condition
to keep an exact Account.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="151">
But to return to my Travellers; Here they were
only examined, and as they &s;eemed rather coming
from the Country than from the City, they found
the People the ea&s;ier with them; that they talk'd to
them, let them come into a publick Hou&s;e where
the Con&s;table and his Warders were, and gave them
Drink and &s;ome Victuals, which greatly refre&s;hed and
encourag'd them; and here it came into their Heads
to &s;ay, when they &s;hould be enquir'd of afterwards,
not that they came from <HI>London,</HI> but that they came
out of <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI></P>
<P>To forward this little Fraud, they obtain'd &s;o
much Favour of the Con&s;table at <HI>Old-Ford,</HI> as to give
them a Certificate of their pa&s;&s;ing from <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> thro'
that Village, and that they had not been at <HI>London;</HI>
which tho' fal&s;e in the common acceptation of <HI>London</HI>
in the County, yet was literally true; <HI>Wapping</HI> or
<HI>Radcliff</HI> being no part either of the City or Liberty.</P>
<P>This Certificate directed to the next Con&s;table
that was at <HI>Hummerton,</HI> one of the Hamlets of the
Pari&s;h of <HI>Hackney,</HI> was &s;o &s;erviceable to them, that
it procurcd them not a free Pa&s;&s;age there only, but
a full Certificate of Health from a Ju&s;tice of the
Peace; who, upon the Con&s;table's Application, grant|ed
it without much Difficulty; and thus they pa&s;s'd
through the long divided Town of <HI>Hackney,</HI> (for it lay
then in &s;everal &s;eparated Hamlets) and travelled on
till they came into the great North Road on the
top of <HI>Stamford-Hill.</HI></P>
<P>By this time they began to be we$ry, and &s;o in the
back Road from <HI>Hackney</HI> a little before it opened in|to
the &s;aid great Road, they re&s;olv'd to &s;et up their
Tent and encamp for the fir&s;t Night; which they did
accordingly, with this addition, that finding a Barn,
or a Building like a Barn, and fir&s;t &s;earching as well
as they could to be &s;ure there was no Body in it,
they &s;et up their Tent, with the Head of it again&s;t
the Barn; this they did al&s;o becau&s;e the Wind blew
<PB N="150" REF="152">
that Night very high, and they were but young
at &s;uch a way of Lodging, as well as at the managing
their Tent.</P>
<P>Here they went to Sleep, but the Joynet, a grave
and &s;ober Man, and not plea&s;ed with their lying at
this loo&s;e rate the fir&s;t Night, could not &s;leep, and
re&s;olv'd, after trying to Sleep to no purpo&s;e, that he
would get out, and taking the Gun in his Hand
&s;tand Centinel and Guard his Companions: So
with the Gun in his Hand he walk'd to and again
before the Barn, for that &s;tood in the Field near the
Road, but within the Hedge. He had not been
long upon the Scout, but he heard a Noi&s;e of Peo|ple
coming on as if it had been a great Number,
and they came on, as he thought, directly towards
the Barn. He did not pre&s;ently awake his Compa|nions,
but in a few Minutes more their Noi&s;e grow|ing
louder and louder, the Bi&s;cuit-Baker call'd to
him and ask'd him what was the Matter, and quick|ly
&s;tarted out too: The other being the Lame Sail|maker
and mo&s;t weary, lay &s;till in the Tent.</P>
<P>As they expected, &s;o the People who they had
heard, came on directly to the Barn, when one of
our Travellers challenged, like Soldiers upon the
Guard, with <HI>Who comes there?</HI> The People did not
An&s;wer immediately, but one of them &s;peaking to
another that was behind him, <HI>Alas! Alas! we are
all di&s;appointed,</HI> &s;ays <HI>he, here are &s;ome People before us,
the Barn is taken up.</HI></P>
<P>They all &s;topp'd upon that as under &s;ome Sur|prize,
and it &s;eems there was about Thirteen of
them in all, and &s;ome Women among them: They
con&s;ulted together what they &s;hould do, and by
their Di&s;cour&s;e our Travellers &s;oon found they were
poor di&s;tre&s;s'd People too like them&s;elves, &s;eeking
Shelter and Safety; and be&s;ides, our Travellers had
no need to be afraid of their coming up to di&s;turb
them; for as &s;oon as they heard the Words, <HI>Who
<PB N="151" REF="153">
comes there,</HI> the&s;e could hear the Women &s;ay, <HI>as if
frighted, Do not go near them, how do you know but
they may have the Plague?</HI> And when one of the Men
&s;aid, <HI>Let us but &s;peak to them;</HI> the Women &s;aid, <HI>No,
don't by any means, we have e&s;cap'd thus far</HI> by the
Goodne&s;s of God, <HI>do not let us run into Danger now,
we be&s;eech you.</HI></P>
<P>Our Travellers found by this that they were a
good &s;ober &s;ort of People and flying for their Lives
as they were; and, as they were encourag'd by it, &s;o
<HI>John</HI> &s;aid to the Joyner his Comtade, <HI>Let us Encourage
them too as much as we can:</HI> So he called to them, <HI>Hark
ye good People</HI> &s;ays the Joyner, we find by your Talk,
that you are fleeing from the &s;ame dreadful Enemy
as we are, do not be afraid of us, we are only three
poor Men of us, if you are free from the Diftemper
you &s;hall not be hurt by us; we are not in the Barn,
but in a little Tent here in the out&s;ide, and we will
remove for you, we can &s;et up our Tent again im|mediately
any where el&s;e; and upon this a Parly
began between the Joyner, who&s;e Name was <HI>Richard,</HI>
and one of their Men, who &s;aid his Name was <HI>Ford.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ford.</HI> And do you a&s;&s;ure us that you are all Sound
Men.</P>
<P><HI>Rich.</HI> Nay, we are concern'd to tell you of it,
that you may not be unea&s;y, or think your &s;elves in
Danger; but you &s;ee we do not de&s;ire you &s;hould
put your &s;elves into any Danger; and therefore I
tell you, that as we have not made u&s;e of the Barn,
&s;o we will remove from it, that you may be Safe
and we al&s;o.</P>
<P><HI>Ford.</HI> That is very kind and charitable; But, if we
have Rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied that you are Sound and
free from the Vi&s;itation, why &s;hould we make you
remove now you are &s;ettled in your Lodging, and
it may be are laid down to Re&s;t? we will go into
the Barn if you plea&s;e, to re&s;t our &s;elves a while, and
we need not di&s;turb you.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="154">
<HI>Rich.</HI> Well, but you are more than we are, I hope
you will a&s;&s;ure us that you are all of you Sound too,
for the Danger is as great from you to us, as from
us to you.</P>
<P><HI>Ford.</HI> Ble&s;&s;ed be God that &s;ome do e&s;cape tho'it
is but few; what may be our Portion &s;till we know
not, but hitherto we are pre&s;erved.</P>
<P><HI>Rich.</HI> What part of the Town do you come from?
Was the Plague come to the Places where you
liv'd?</P>
<P><HI>Ford.</HI> Ay ay, in a mo&s;t frightful and terrible man|ner,
or el&s;e we had not fled away as we do; but we
believe there will be very few left alive behind us.</P>
<P><HI>Rich.</HI> What Part do you come from?</P>
<P><HI>Ford.</HI> We are mo&s;t of us of <HI>Cripplegate</HI> Pari&s;h, on|ly
two or three of <HI>Clerkenwell</HI> Pari&s;h, but on the hi|ther
&s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Rich.</HI> How then was it that you came away no
&s;ooner?</P>
<P><HI>Ford.</HI> We have been away &s;ome time, and kept
together as well as we could at the hither End of
<HI>I&s;lington,</HI> where we got leave to lie in an old unin|habited
Hou&s;e, and had &s;ome Bedding and Conve|niencies
of our own that we brought with us, but
the Plague is come up into <HI>I&s;lington</HI> too, and a Hou&s;e
next Door to our poor Dwelling was Infected and
&s;hut up, and we are come away in a Fright.</P>
<P><HI>Rich.</HI> And what Way are you going?</P>
<P><HI>Ford.</HI> As our Lott &s;hall ca&s;t us, we know not
whither, but God will Guide tho&s;e that look up
to him.</P>
<P>They parlied no further at that time, but came
all up to the Barn, and with &s;ome Difficulty got
into it: There was nothing but Hay in the Barn,
but it was almo&s;t full of that, and they accommo|dated
them&s;elves as well as they cou'd, and went to
Re&s;t; but our Travellers ob&s;erv'd, that before they
went to Sleep, an antient Man, who it &s;eems was
<PB N="153" REF="155">
Father of one of the Women, went to Prayer with
all the Company, recommending them&s;elves to the
Ble&s;&s;ing and Direction of Providence, before they
went to Sleep.</P>
<P>It was &s;oon Day at that time of the Year; and as
<HI>Richard</HI> the Joyner had kept Guard the fir&s;t part of
the Night, &s;o <HI>John</HI> the Soldier Reliev'd him, and
he had the Po&s;t in the Morning, and they began
to be acquainted with one another. It &s;eems, when
they left <HI>I&s;lington,</HI> they intended to have gone North
away to <HI>Highgate,</HI> but were &s;top'd a$ <HI>H$lloway,</HI> and
there they would not let them pa&s;s; &s;o they cro&s;s'd
over the Fields and Hills to the Ea&s;tward, and
came out at the <HI>Boarded-River,</HI> and &s;o avoiding the
Towns, they left <HI>Horn&s;ey</HI> on the left Hand, and <HI>New|ington</HI>
on the right Hand, and came into the great
Road about <HI>Stamford-Hill</HI> on that &s;ide, as the three
Travellers had done on the other &s;ide: And now they
had Thoughts of going over the River in the Mar|&s;hes,
and make forwards to <HI>Epping</HI> Fore&s;t, where they
hoped they &s;hould get leave to Re&s;t. It &s;eems they
were not Poor, at lea&s;t not &s;o Poor as to be in Want;
at lea&s;t they had enough to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them moderately
for two or three Months, when, as they &s;aid, they
were in Hopes the cold Weather would check the
Infection, or at lea&s;t the Violence of it would have
&s;pent it&s;elf, and would abate, if it were only for want
of People left alive to be Infected.</P>
<P>This was much the Fate of our three Travellers;
only that they &s;eemed to be the better furni&s;h'd for
Travelling, and had it in their View to go further
off; for as to the fir&s;t, they did not propo&s;e to go
farther than one Day's Journey, that &s;o they might
have Intelligence every two or three Days how
Things were at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>But here our Travellers found them&s;elves un|der
an unexpected Inconvenience namely, that
of their Hor&s;e, for by means of the Hor&s;e to
carry their Baggag$, they were obliged to keep
<PB N="154" REF="156">
keep in the Road, whereas the People of this other
Band went over the Fields or Roads, Path or no
Path, Way, or no Way, as they plea&s;ed; neither had
they any Occa&s;ion to pa&s;s thro' any Town, or come
near any Town, other than to buy &s;uch Things as
they wanted for their nece&s;&s;ary Sub&s;i&s;tence, and in
that indeed they were put to much Difficulty: Of
which in its Place.</P>
<P>But our three Travellers were oblig'd to keep the
Road, or el&s;e they mu&s;t commit Spoil and do the
Country a great deal of Damage in breaking down
Fences and Gates, to go over enclo&s;ed Fields, which
they were loth to do if they could help it.</P>
<P>Our three Travellers however had a great Mind
to join them&s;elves to this Company, and take
their Lot with them; and after &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e, they
laid a&s;ide their fir&s;t De&s;ign which look'd Northward,
and re&s;olv'd to follow the other into <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> &s;o in the
Morning they took up their Tent and loaded their
Hor&s;e, and away they travelled all together.</P>
<P>They had &s;ome Difficulty in pa&s;&s;ing the Ferry at
the River &s;ide, the Ferry-Man being afraid of them;
but after &s;ome Parly at a Di&s;tance, the Ferry-Man
was content to bring his Boat to a Place di&s;tant from
the u&s;ual Ferry, and leave it there for them to
take it; &s;o putting them&s;elves over, he directed them
to leave the Boat, and he having another Boat,
&s;aid he would fetch it again, which it &s;eems however
he did not do for above Eight Days.</P>
<P>Here giving the Ferry-Man Money before-hand,
$hey had a &s;upply of Victuals and Drink, which he
brought and left in the Boat for them, but not with|out,
as I &s;aid, having receiv'd the Mony before-hand.
But now our Travellers were at a great Lo&s;s and
Difficulty how to get the Hor&s;e over, the Boat be|ing
&s;mall and not fit for it, and at la&s;t cou'd not do
it without unloading the Baggage, and making him
&s;wim over.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="157">
From the River they travelled towards the Fore&s;t,
but when they came to <HI>Waltham&s;tow</HI> the People of
that Town denied to admit them, as was the Ca&s;e
every where: The Con&s;tables and their Watchmen
kept them off at a Di&s;tance, and Parly'd with them;
they gave the &s;ame Account of them&s;elves as before,
but the&s;e gave no Credit to what they &s;aid, giving
it for a Rea&s;on that two or three Companies had al|ready
come that Way and made the like Pretences,
but that they had given &s;everal People the Di&s;tem|per
in the Towns where they had pa&s;s'd, and had
been afterwards &s;o hardly us'd by the Country,
tho' with Ju&s;tice too, as they had de&s;erv'd; that a|bout
<HI>Brent-Wood</HI> or that Way, &s;everal of them Pe|ri&s;h'd
in the Fields, whether of the Plague, or of
mere Want and Di&s;tre&s;s, they could not tell.</P>
<P>This was a good Rea&s;on indeed why the People
of <HI>Waltham&s;tow</HI> &s;hou'd be very cautious, and why
they &s;hou'd re&s;olve not to entertain any Body that
they were not well &s;atisfied of. But as <HI>Richard</HI> the
Joyner, and one of the other Men who parly'd with
them told them, it was no Rea&s;on why they &s;hould
block up the Roads, and refu&s;e to let People pa&s;s
thro' the Town, and who ask'd nothing of them, but
to go through the Street: That if their People were
afraid of them, they might go into their Hou&s;es and
&s;hut their Doors, they would neither &s;how them
Civility nor Incivility, but go on about their Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The Con&s;tables and Attendants, not to be per|&s;waded
by Rea&s;on, continued Ob&s;tinate, and wou'd
hearken to nothing; &s;o the two Men that talk'd with
them went back to their Fellows, to con&s;ult what
was to be done: It was very di&s;couraging in the
whole, and they knew not what to do for a good
while: But at la&s;t <HI>John</HI> the Soldier and Bi&s;cuit-Baker
con&s;idering a-while, Come, &s;ays he, leave the re&s;t of
the Parly to me; he had not appear'd yet, &s;o he
&s;ets the Joyner <HI>Richard</HI> to Work to cut &s;ome Poles
<PB N="156" REF="158">
out of the Trees, and &s;hape them as like Guns as
he could, and in a little time he had five or &s;ix fair
Muskets, which at a Di&s;tance would not be known;
and about the Part where the Lock of a Gun is
he cau&s;ed them to wrap Cloths and Rags, &s;uch as
they had, as Soldiers do in wet Weather, to pre|&s;erve
the Locks of their Pieces from Ru&s;t, the re&s;t
was di&s;colour'd with Clay or Mud, &s;uch as they
could get; and all this while the re&s;t of them &s;at
under the Trees by his Direction, in two or three
Bodies, where they made Fires at a good Di&s;tance
from one another.</P>
<P>While this was doing, he advanc'd him&s;elf and two
or three with him, and &s;et up their Tent in the Lane
within &s;ight of the Barrier which the Town's Men
had made, and &s;et a Centinel ju&s;t by it with the re|al
Gun, the only one they had, and who walked to
and fro with the Gun on his Shoulder, &s;o as that
the People of the Town might &s;ee them; al&s;o he
ty'd the Hor&s;e to a Gate in the Hedge ju&s;t by, and
got &s;ome dry Sticks together and kindled a Fire on
the other &s;ide of the Tent, &s;o that the People of the
Town cou'd &s;ee the Fire and the Smoak, but cou'd
not &s;ee what they were doing at it.</P>
<P>After the Country People had look'd upon them
very earne&s;tly a great while, and by all that they
could &s;ee, cou'd not but &s;uppo&s;e that they were a
great many in Company, they began to be unea&s;ie,
not for their going away, but for &s;taying where
they were; and above all perceiving they had Hor|&s;es
and Arms, for they had &s;een one Hor&s;e and one
Gun at the Tent, and they had &s;een others of them
walk about the Field on the in&s;ide of the Hedge,
by the &s;ide of the Lane with their Muskets, as they
took them to be, Shoulder'd: I &s;ay, upon &s;uch a
Sight as this, you may be a&s;&s;ured they were Alarm'd
and terribly Frighted; and it &s;eems they went to a
Ju&s;tice of the Peace to know what they &s;hould do;
what the Ju&s;tice advis'd them to I know not,

<P>Accordingly they &s;ent to the Place twenty Loaves
of Bread, and three or four large pieces of good
Beef, and opened &s;ome Gates thro' which they
pa&s;s'd, but none of them had Courage &s;o much as to
look out to &s;ee them go, and, as it was Evening,
if they had looked they cou'd not have &s;een them
&s;o as to know how few they were.</P>
<P>This was <HI>John</HI> the Soldier's Management. But
this gave &s;uch an Alarm to the County&punc; that had
they really been two or three Hundred, the whole
County would have been rais'd upon them, and they
wou'd ha' been &s;ent to Pri&s;on, or perhaps knock'd
on the Head.</P>
<P>They were &s;oon made &s;en&s;ible of this, for two
Days afterwards they found &s;everal Parties of Hor&s;e|men
and Footmen al&s;o about, in pur&s;uit of three
Companies of Men arm'd, <HI>as they &s;aid,</HI> with Mus|kets,
who were broke out from <HI>London,</HI> and had
the Plague upon the$$$ and that were not only
&s;preading the Di&s;temper among the People, but
plundering the Country.</P>
<P>As they &s;aw now the Con&s;equence of their Ca&s;e,
they &s;oon &s;ee the Danger they were in, &s;o they re|&s;olv'd
by the Advice al&s;o of the old Soldier, to di|vide
them&s;elves again.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Here he call'd to one of his Men, and bade him order Capt. <HI>Richard</HI> and his People to March the Lower Way on the &s;ide of the Mar&s;hes, and meet them in the Fore&s;t; which was all a Sham&punc; for they had no Captain <HI>Richard.</HI> or any &s;uch Company.</NOTE> <HI>John</HI> and his two Com|rades
<PB N="161" REF="163">
with the Hor&s;e, went away as if towards <HI>Wal|tham;</HI>
the other in two Companies, but all a little
a&s;under, and went towards <HI>Epping.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Night they Encamp'd all in the Fore&s;t,
and not far off of one another, but not &s;etting up the
Tent, le&s;t that &s;hould di&s;cover them: On the other
hand <HI>Richard</HI> went to work with his Axe and his Hat|chet,
and cutting down Branches of Trees, he built
three Tents or Hovels, in which they all Encamp'd
with as much Convenience as they could expect.</P>
<P>The Provi&s;ions thy had had at <HI>Waltham&s;tow</HI> &s;erv'd
them very plenti&s;ully th$s Night, and as for the
next they left it to Providence; they had far'd
&s;o well with the old Soldier's Conduct, that
they now willingly made him their Leader; and
the fir&s;t of his Conduct appear'd to be very good:
He told them that they were now at a pro|per
Di&s;tance enough from <HI>London;</HI> that as they
need not be immediately beholden to the Coun|ty
for Relief, &s;o they ought to be as careful the
Country did not infect them, as that they did not
infect the Country; that what little Money they
had they mu&s;t be as frugal of as they could; that
as he would not have them think of offering the
Country any Violence, &s;o they mu&s;t endeavour to
make the Sen&s;e of their Condition go as far with
the Country as it could: They all referr'd them|&s;elves
to his Direction; &s;o they left their 3 Hou&s;es
&s;tanding and the next Day went away towards <HI>Ep|ping;</HI>
the Captain al&s;o, for &s;o they now called him,
and his two Fellow Travellers laid a &s;ide their De|&s;ign
of going to <HI>Waltham,</HI> and all went together.</P>
<P>When they came near <HI>Epping</HI> they halted, choo|&s;ing
out a proper Place in the open Fore&s;t, not ve|ry
near the High-way, but not far out of it on the
North-&s;ide, under a little clu&s;ter of low Pollard|Trees:
Here they pitched their little Camp, which
con&s;i&s;ted of three large Tents or Hutts made of
Poles, which their Carpenter, and &s;uch as were his
<PB N="162" REF="164">
A&s;&s;i&s;tants, cut down and fix'd in the Ground in a
Circle&punc; binding all the &s;mall Ends together at the
Top, and thickning the &s;ides with Boughs of
Trees and Bu&s;hes, &s;o that they were compleatly
clo&s;e and warm. They had be&s;ides this, a little
Tent where the Women lay by them&s;elves, and a
Hutt to put the Hor&s;e in.</P>
<P>It happened that the next day, or next but one was
Market-day at <HI>Epping;</HI> when Capt. <HI>John,</HI> and one of
the other Men, went to Market, and bought &s;ome
Provi&s;ions, that is to &s;ay Bread, and &s;ome Mutton
and Beef; and two of the Women went &s;eparately,
as if they had not belong'd to the re&s;t, and bought
more. <HI>John</HI> took the Hor&s;e to bring it Home, and
the Sack (which the Carpenter carry'd his Tools
in) to put it in: The Carpenter went to Work
and made them Benches and Stools to &s;it on, &s;uch
as the Wood he cou'd get wou'd afford, and a kind
of a Table to dine on.</P>
<P>They were taken no Notice of for two or three
Days, but after that, abundance of People ran out
of the Town to look at them, and all the Country
was alarmed about them. The People at fir&s;t &s;eem'd
afraid to come near them, and on the other Hand
they de&s;ir'd the People to keep off, for there was a
Rumour that the Plague was at <HI>Waltham,</HI> and that it
had been in <HI>Epping</HI> two or three Days So <HI>John</HI> called
out to them not to come to them, <HI>For,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>we
are all whole and &s;ound People here, and we would not
have you bring the Plague among us, nor pretend we
brought it among you.</HI></P>
<P>After this the Pari&s;h Officers came up to them
and parly'd with them at a Di&s;tance, and de&s;ir'd to
know who they were and by what Authority they
pretended to fix their Stand at that Place? <HI>John</HI>
an&s;wered very frankly, they were poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
People from <HI>London,</HI> who fore&s;eeing the Mi&s;ery they
&s;hould be reduc'd to, if the Plague &s;pread into the
<PB N="163" REF="165">
City, had fled out in time for their Lives, and ha|ving
no Acquaintance or Relations to fly to, had
fir&s;t taken up at <HI>I&s;lington</HI> but the Plague being come
into that Town, were fled further, and as they &s;up|pos'd
that the People of <HI>Epping</HI> might have refus'd
them coming into their Town, they had pitch'd their
Tents thus in the open Field, and in the Fore&s;t,
being willing to bear all the Hard&s;hips of &s;uch
a di&s;con&s;olate Lodging, rather than have any one
think or be afraid that they &s;hould receive Injury
by them.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t the <HI>Epping</HI> People talk'd roughly to them,
and told them they mu&s;t remove; that this was no
Place for them; and that they pretended to be
Sound and Well, but that they might be infected
with the Plague for ought they knew, and might
infect the whole Country, and they cou'd not &s;uffer
them there.</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> argu'd very calmly with them a great while,
and told them, &startq;That <HI>London</HI> was the Place by
which they, that is, the Town&s;men of <HI>Epping</HI> and
all the Country round them, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted&punc; to whom
they &s;old the produce of their Lands, and out of
whom they made the Rent of their Farms; and
to be &s;o cruel to the Inhabitants of <HI>London&punc;</HI> or
to any of tho&s;e by whom they gain'd &s;o much
was very hard, and they would be loth to have
it remembered hereafter, and have it told how
barbarous, how unho&s;pitable and how unkind
they were to the People of <HI>London,</HI> when they
fled from the Face of the mo&s;t terrible Enemy
in the World; that it would be enough to make
the Name of an <HI>Epping-</HI>Man hateful thro' all the
City, and to have the Rabble Stone them in the
very Streets, whenever they came &s;o much as to
Market; that they were not yet &s;ecure from being
Vi&s;ited them&s;elves, and that as he heard, <HI>Waltham</HI>
was already; that they would think it very hard
<PB N="164" REF="166">
that when any of them fled for Fear before
they were touch'd, they &s;hould be deny'd the
Liberty of lying &s;o much as in the open Fields.&endq;</P>
<P>The <HI>Epping</HI> Men told them again, That they, in|deed,
&s;aid they were &s;ound and free from the In|fection,
but that they had no a&s;&s;urance of it; and
that it was reported, that there had been a great
Rabble of People at <HI>Waltham&s;tow,</HI> who made &s;uch
Pretences of being &s;ound, as they did, but that they
threaten'd to plunder the Town, and force their
Way whether the Pari&s;h Officers would or no:
That they were near 200 of them, and had Arms
and Tents like Low-Country Soldiers; that they
extorted Provi&s;ions from the Town by threat|ning
them with living upon them at free Quarter,
&s;hewing their Arms, and talking in the Language
of Soldiers; and that &s;everal of them being gone
away towards <HI>Rumford</HI> and <HI>Brent-Wood,</HI> the Coun|try
had been infected by them, and the Plague
&s;pread into both tho&s;e large Towns, &s;o that the
People dur&s;t not go to Market there as u&s;ual; that
it was very likely they were &s;ome of that Party,
and if &s;o, they de&s;erv'd to be &s;ent to the County
Jail, and be &s;ecur'd till they had made Satisfaction
for the Damage they had done, and for the Terror
and Fright they had put the Country into.</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> an&s;wered, That what other People had done
was nothing to them&punc; that he a&s;&s;ured them they
were all of one Company; that they had never
been more in Number than they &s;aw them at that
time; (which by the way was very true) that they
came out in two &s;eperate Companies, but joyn'd
by the Way, their Ca&s;es being the &s;ame; that
they were ready to give what Account of them|&s;elves
any Body cou'd de&s;ire of them, and to give
in their Names and Places of Abode, that &s;o they
might be call'd to an Account for any Di&s;order
that they might be guilty of; that the Town&s;men
<PB N="165" REF="167">
might &s;ee they were content to live hardly, and
only de&s;ir'd a little Room to breath in on the Fo|re&s;t
where it was whol&s;ome, for where it was not
they cou'd not &s;tay, and wou'd decamp if they
found it otherwi&s;e there.</P>
<P>But, &s;aid the Town&s;men, we have a great charge
of Poor upon our Hands already, and we mu&s;t take
care not to encrea&s;e it; we &s;uppo&s;e you can give us
no Security again&s;t your being chargeable to our
Pari&s;h and to the Inhabitants, any more than you
can of being dangerous to us as to the Infection.</P>
<P>&startq;Why look you, <HI>&s;ays John,</HI> as to being charge|able
to you, we hope we &s;hall not; if you will re|lieve
us with Provi&s;ions for our pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ity,
we will be very thankful; as we all liv'd without
Charity when we were at Home, &s;o we will o|blige
our&s;elves fully to repay you, if God plea&s;e
to bring us back to our own Families and Hou&s;es
in Safety, and to re&s;tore Health to the People of
<HI>London.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to our dying here, we a&s;&s;ure you, if any of
us die, we that &s;urvive, will bury them, and put
you to no Expence, except it &s;hould be that we
&s;hould all die, and then indeed the la&s;t Man not
being able to bury him&s;elf, would put you to that
&s;ingle Expence which I am per&s;waded, &s;ays <HI>John,</HI>
he would leave enough behind him to pay you for
the Expence of.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;On the other Hand, &s;ays <HI>John,</HI> if you will &s;hut
up all Bowels of Compa&s;&s;ion and not relieve us
at all, we &s;hall not extort any thing by Violence,
or &s;teal from any one; but when what little we
have is &s;pent, if we peri&s;h for want, God's Will
be done.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> wrought &s;o upon the Town&s;men by talking
thus rationally and &s;moothly to them, that they
went away; and tho' they did not give any con&s;ent
to their &s;taying there, yet they did not mole&s;t them;
<PB N="166" REF="168">
and the poor People continued there three or four
Days longer without any Di&s;turbance. In this
time they had got &s;ome remote Acquaintance with
a Victualling-Hou&s;e at the out-skirts of the Town,
to whom they called at a Di&s;tance to bring &s;ome
little Things that they wanted, and which they
caus'd to to be &s;et down at a Di&s;tance, and always
paid for very hone&s;tly.</P>
<P>During this Time, the younger People of the
Town came frequently pretty near them, and wou'd
&s;tand and look at them, and &s;ometimes talk with
them at &s;ome Space between; and particularly it was
ob&s;erved, that the fir&s;t Sabbath Day the poor People
kept retir'd, wor&s;hip'd God together, and were heard
to &s;ing P&s;alms.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things and a quiet inoffen&s;ive Behaviour,
began to get them the good Opinion of the Coun|try,
and People began to pity them and &s;peak very
well of them; the Con&s;equence of which was,
that upon the occa&s;ion of a very wet rainy
Night, a certain Gentleman who liv'd in the
Ne$ghbourhood, &s;ent them a little Cart with twelve
Tru&s;&s;es of Bundles of Straw, as well for them to
lodge upon, as to cover and thatch their Huts, and
to keep them dry: The Mini&s;ter of a Pari&s;h not
far off, not knowing of the other, &s;ent them al&s;o
about two Bu&s;hels of Wheat, and half a Bu&s;hel of
white Peas.</P>
<P>They were very thankful to-be-&s;ure for this Relief,
and particularly the Straw was a very great Comfort
to them; for tho' the ingenious Carpenter had made
Frames for them to lie in like Troughs, and fill'd them
with Leaves of Trees, and &s;uch Things as they could
get, and had cut all their Tent-cloth out to make
them Coverlids, yet they lay damp, and hard, and
unwhol$&s;ome till this Straw came, which was to
them like Feather-beds, and, as <HI>John</HI> &s;aid, more wel|come
than Feather-beds wou'd ha' been at another
time.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="169">
This Gentleman and the Mini&s;ter having thus
begun and given an Example of Charity to the&s;e
Wanderers, others quickly followed, and they re|ceiv'd
every Day &s;ome Benevolence or other from the
People, but chiefly from the Gentlemen who dwelt
in the Country round about; &s;ome &s;ent them Chairs,
Stools, Tables, and &s;uch Hou&s;hold Things as they
gave Notice they wanted; &s;ome &s;ent them Blan|kets,
Rugs and Coverlids; &s;ome Earthen-ware; and
&s;ome Kitchin-ware for ordering their Food.</P>
<P>Encourag'd by this good U&s;age, their Carpenter
in a few Days, built them a large Shed or Hou&s;e
with Rafters, and a Roof in Form, and an upper
Floor in which they lodged warm, for the Weather
began to be damp and cold in the beginning of <HI>Sep|tember;</HI>
But this Hou&s;e being very well Thatch'd,
and the Sides and Roof made very thick, kept out
the Cold well enough: He made al&s;o an earthen
Wall at one End, with a Chimney in it; and ano|ther
of the Company, with a va&s;t deal of Trouble
and Pains, made a Funnel to the Chimney to car|ry
out the Smoak.</P>
<P>Here they liv'd very comfortably, tho' coar&s;ely,
till the beginning of <HI>September,</HI> when they had the
bad News to hear, whether true or not, that the
Plague, which was very hot at <HI>Waltham-Abby</HI> on
one &s;ide, and at <HI>Rumford</HI> and <HI>Brent-Wood</HI> on the
other &s;ide; was al&s;o come to <HI>Epping,</HI> to <HI>Woodford,</HI>
and to mo&s;t of the Towns upon the Fore&s;t, and
which, as they &s;aid, was brought down among them
chiefly by the Higlers and &s;uch People as went to
and from <HI>London</HI> with Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>If this was true, it was an evident Contradiction
to that Report which was afterwards &s;pread all over
<HI>England,</HI> but which, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> I cannot confirm of
my own Knowledge, namely, That the Market People
carrying Provi&s;ions to the City, never got the Infec|tion
<PB N="168" REF="170">
or carry'd it back into the Country; both which
I have been a&s;&s;ured, has been fal&s;e.</P>
<P>It might be that they were pre&s;erv'd even beyond
Expectation, though not to a Miracle, that abun|dance
went and co$e, and were not touch'd,
and that was much for the Encouragement of the
poor People of <HI>London,</HI> who had been compleatly
mi&s;erable, if the People that brought Provi&s;ions
to the Markets had not been many times wonder|fully
pre&s;erv'd, or at lea$t more pre&s;erv'd than cou'd
be rea&s;onably expected.</P>
<P>But now the&s;e new Inmates began to be di&s;turb'd
more effectually, for the Towns about them were re|ally
infected, and they began to be afraid to tru&s;t
one another &s;o much as to go abroad for &s;uch things
as they wanted, and this pinch'd them very hard;
for now they had little or nothing but what the cha|ritable
Gentlemen of the Country &s;upply'd them
with: But for their Encouragement it happen'd, that
other Gentlemen in the Country who had not &s;ent 'em
any thing before, began to hear of them and &s;upply
them, and one &s;ent them a large Pig, that is to &s;ay
a Porker; another two Sheep; and another &s;ent
them a Calf: In &s;hort, they had Meat enough, and,
&s;ometimes had Chee&s;e and Milk, and all &s;uch things;
They were chie&s;ly put to it for Bread, for when the
Gentlemen &s;ent them Corn they had no where to
$ake it, or to grind it: This made them eat the fir&s;t
two Bu&s;hel of Wheat that was &s;ent them in parched
Corn, as the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> of old did without grinding or
making Bread of it.</P>
<P>At la&s;t they found means to carry their Corn to a
Windmill near <HI>Woodford,</HI> where they had it ground;
and af$erwards the Bi&s;cuit Baker made a Hearth &s;o
hollow and dry that he cou'd bake Bi&s;cuit Cakes
tolerably well; and thus they came into a Condition
to live without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance or &s;upplies from the
Towns; and it was well they did, for the Country
was &s;oon after fully Infected, and about 120 were
<PB N="169" REF="171">
&s;aid to have died of the Di&s;temper in the Villages
near them, which was a terrible thing to them.</P>
<P>On this they call'd a new Council, and now the
Towns had no need to be afraid they &s;hould &s;ettle
near them, but on the contrary &s;everal Families of
the poorer &s;ort of the Inhabitants quitted their Hou|&s;es,
and built Hutts in the Fore&s;t after the &s;ame
manner as they had done: But it was ob&s;erv'd, that
&s;everal of the&s;e poor People that had &s;o remov'd,
had the Sickne&s;s even in their Hutts or Booths; the
Rea&s;on of which was plain, namely, not becau&s;e they
removed into the Air, but becau&s;e they did not re|move
time enough, that is to &s;ay, not till by openly
conver&s;ing with the other People their Neighbours,
they had the Di&s;temper upon them, or, (as may be
&s;aid) among them, and &s;o carry'd it about them whi|ther
they went: Or, (2.) Becau&s;e they were not
careful enough after they were &s;afely removed out
of the Towns, not to come in again and mingle with
the di&s;ea&s;ed People.</P>
<P>But be it which of the&s;e it will, when our Tra|vellers
began to perceive that the Plague was not
only in the Towns, but even in the Tents and Huts
on the Fore&s;t near them, they began then not only
to be afraid, but to think of decamping and remo|ving;
for had they &s;tay'd, they wou'd ha' been in
manife&s;t Danger of their Lives.</P>
<P>It is not to be wondered that they were greatly
afflicted, as being obliged to quit the Place where
they had been &s;o kindly receiv'd, and where they
had been treated with &s;o much Humanity and Cha|rity;
but Nece&s;&s;ity, and the hazard of Life, which
they came out &s;o far to pre&s;erve, prevail'd with
them, and they &s;aw no Remedy. <HI>John</HI> however
thought of a Remedy for their pre&s;ent Misfortune,
namely, that he would fir&s;t acquaint that Gentleman
who was their principal Benefactor, with the Di&s;tre&s;s
they were in, and to crave his A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Ad|vice.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="172">
The good charitable Gentleman encourag'd them
to quit the Place, for fear they &s;hould be cut off
from any Retreat at all, by the Violence of the Di|&s;temper;
but whither they &s;hould go, that he found
very hard to direct them to. At la&s;t <HI>John</HI> ask'd of
him, whether he (being a Ju&s;tice of the Peace) would
give them Certificates of Health to other Ju&s;tices
who they might come before, that &s;o whatever might
be their Lot they might not be repul&s;ed now they
had been al&s;o &s;o long from <HI>London.</HI> This his Wor|&s;hip
immediately granted, and gave them proper
Letters of Health, and from thence they were at Li|berty
to travel whither they plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Accordingly they had a full Certificate of Health,
intimating, That they had re&s;ided in a Village in the
County of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;o long, that being examined and &s;cru|tiniz'd
&s;ufficiently, and having been retir'd from all
Conver&s;ation for above 40 Days, without any appear|ance
of Sickne&s;s, they were therefore certainly conclu|ded
to be Sound Men, and might be &s;afely entertain'd
any where, having at la&s;t remov'd rather for fear of
the Plague, which was come into <HI>&s;uch a Town,</HI> ra|ther
than for having any &s;ignal of Infection upon
them, or upon any belonging to them.</P>
<P>With this Certificate they remov'd, tho' with
great Reluctance; and <HI>John</HI> inclining not to go far
from Home, they mov'd towards the Mar&s;hes on
the &s;ide of <HI>Waltham:</HI> But here they found a Man,
who it &s;eems kept a Weer or Stop upon the River,
made to rai&s;e the Water for the Barges which go
up and down the River, and he terrified them with
di&s;mal Stories of the Sickne&s;s having been &s;pread in|to
all the Towns on the River, and near the River,
on the &s;ide of <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Hertford&s;hire;</HI> that is to
&s;ay, into <HI>Waltham, Waltham-Cro&s;s, Enfield</HI> and <HI>Ware,</HI>
and all the Towns on the Road, that they were a|fraid
to go that way; tho' it &s;eems the Man impos'd
upon them, for that the thing was not really true.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="173">
However it terrified them, and they re&s;olved to
move cro&s;s the Fore&s;t towards <HI>Rumford</HI> and <HI>Brent-Wood;</HI>
but they heard that there were numbers of
People fled out of <HI>London</HI> that way, who lay up and
down in the Fore&s;t call'd <HI>Henalt</HI> Fore&s;t, reaching
near <HI>Rumford,</HI> and who having no Sub&s;i&s;tence or Ha|bitation,
not only liv'd oddly, and &s;uffered great Ex|tremities
in the Woods and Fields for want of Re|lief,
but were &s;aid to be made &s;o de&s;perate by tho&s;e
Extremities, as that they offer'd many Violences to
the County, robb'd and plunder'd, and kill'd Cattle,
and the like; that others building Hutts and Hovels
by the Road-&s;ide Begg'd, and that with an Impor|tunity
next Door to demanding Relief; &s;o that the
County was very unea&s;y, and had been oblig'd to
take &s;ome of them up.</P>
<P>This, in the fir&s;t Place intimated to them, that they
would be &s;ure to find the Charity and Kindne&s;s of
the County, which they had found here where they
were before, hardned and &s;hut up again&s;t them; and
that on the other Hand, they would be que&s;tion'd
where-ever they came, and would be in Danger of
Violence from others in like Ca&s;es as them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Upon all the&s;e Con&s;iderations, <HI>John,</HI> their Cap|tain,
in all their Names, went back to their good
Friend and Benefactor, who had reliev'd them be|fore,
and laying their Ca&s;e truly before him, hum|bly
ask'd his Advice; and he as kindly advi&s;ed
them to take up their old Quarters again, or if not,
to remove but a little further out of the Road,
and directed them to a proper Place for them;
and as they really wanted &s;ome Hou&s;e rather than
Huts to &s;helter them at that time of the Year, it
growing on towards <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> they found an old
decay'd Hou&s;e, which had been formerly &s;ome Cot|tage
or little Habitation, but was &s;o out of repair
as &s;carce habitable, and by the con&s;ent of a Farmer
<PB N="172" REF="174">
to who&s;e Farm it belong'd, they got leave to make
what u&s;e of it they could.</P>
<P>The ingenious Joyner and all the re&s;t by his Di|rections,
went to work with it, and in a very few
Days made it capable to &s;helter them all in ca&s;e of
bad Weather, and in which there was an old Chim|ney,
and an old Oven, tho' both lying in Ruins,
yet they made them both fit for U&s;e, and rai&s;ing
Additions, Sheds, and Leantoo's on every &s;ide, they
&s;oon made the Hou&s;e capable to hold them all.</P>
<P>They chiefly wanted Boards to make Window-&s;hutters,
Floors, Doors, and &s;everal other Things;
but as the Gentlemen above favour'd them, and the
Country was by that Means made ea&s;y with them,
and above all, that they were known to be all &s;ound
and in good health, every Body help'd them with
what they could &s;pare.</P>
<P>Here they encamp'd for good and all, and re&s;olv'd
to remove no more; they &s;aw plainly how terribly
alarm'd that County was every where, at any Body
that came from <HI>London;</HI> and that they &s;hould have
no admittance any where but with the utmo&s;t Dif|ficulty,
at lea&s;t no friendly Reception and A&s;&s;i|&s;tance
as they had receiv'd here.</P>
<P>Now altho' they receiv'd great A&s;&s;i&s;tance and En|couragement
from the Country Gentlemen and from
the People round about them, yet they were put to
great Straits, for the Weather grew cold and wet in
<HI>October</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> and they had not been us'd to &s;o
much hard&s;hip; &s;o that they got Colds in their Limbs,
and Di&s;tempers, but never had the Infection: And
thus about <HI>December</HI> they came home to the City
again.</P>
<P>I give this Story thus at large, principally to give
an Account what became of the great Numbers of
People which immediately appear'd in the City
as &s;oon as the Sickne&s;s abated: For, as I have &s;aid,
great Numbers of tho&s;e that were able and had
<PB N="173" REF="175">
Retreats in the Country, fled to tho&s;e Retreats;
So when it was encrea&s;ed to &s;uch a frightful Extre|mity
as I have related, the midling People who had
not Friends, fled to all Parts of the Country where
they cou'd get &s;helter, as well tho&s;e that had Mony
to relieve them&s;elves; as tho&s;e that had not. Tho&s;e
that had Mony always fled farthe&s;t, becau&s;e they
were able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them&s;elves; but tho&s;e who were
empty, &s;uffer'd, as I have &s;aid, great Hard&s;hips, and
were often driven by Nece&s;&s;ity to relieve their Wants
at the Expence of the Country: By that Means the
Country was made very unea&s;ie at them, and &s;ome|times
took them up, tho' even then they &s;carce knew
what to do with them, and were always very back|ward
to puni&s;h them, but often too they forced
them from Place to Place, till they were oblig'd to
come back again to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>I have, &s;ince my knowing this Story of <HI>John</HI> and
his Brother, enquir'd and found, that there were a
great many of the poor di&s;con&s;olate People, as above,
fled into the Country every way, and &s;ome of them
got little Sheds, and Barns, and Out-hou&s;es to
live in, where they cou'd obtain &s;o much Kind|ne&s;s
of the Country, and e&s;pecially where they had
any the lea&s;t &s;atisfactory Account to give of them|&s;elves,
and particularly that they did not come out of
<HI>London</HI> too late. But others, and that in great Num|bers,
built them&s;elves little Hutts and Retreats in the
Fields and Woods, and liv'd like Hermits in Holes
and Caves, or any Place they cou'd find; and where,
we may be &s;ure, they &s;uffer'd great Extremities,
&s;uch that many of them were oblig'd to come back
again whatever the Danger was; and &s;o tho&s;e little
Huts were often found empty, and the Country
People &s;uppos'd the Inhabitants lay Dead in them of
the Plague, and would not go near them for fear, no
not in a great while; nor is it unlikely but that &s;ome of
<PB N="174" REF="176">
the unhappy Wanderers might die &s;o all alone, even
&s;ometimes for want of Help, as particularly in one
Tent or Hutt, was found a Man dead, and on the
Gate of a Field ju&s;t by, was cut with his Knife in
uneven Letters, the following Words, by which it
may be &s;uppos'd the other Man e&s;cap'd, or that one
dying fir&s;t, the other bury'd him as well as he could;
<Q><L>Om Is ErY!</L>
<L>We BoTH ShaLL DyE,</L>
<L>WoE, WoE.</L></Q></P>
<P>I have given an Account already of what I found to
ha' been the Ca&s;e down the River among the Sea-faring
Men, how the Ships lay in the <HI>Offing,</HI> as 'tis call'd,
in Rows or Lines a-&s;tern of one another, quite
down from the <HI>Pool</HI> as far as I could &s;ee, I have been
told, that they lay in the &s;ame manner quite down
the River as low as <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> and &s;ome far beyond,
even every where, or in every Place where they
cou'd ride with Safety as to Wind and Weather;
Nor did I ever hear that the Plague reach'd to any
of the People on board tho&s;e Ships, except &s;uch
as lay up in the <HI>Pool,</HI> or as high as <HI>Deptford</HI> Reach,
altho' the People went frequently on Shoar to the
Country Towns and Villages, and Farmers Hou&s;es,
to buy fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, Fowls, Pigs, Calves, and the
like for their Supply.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e I found that the Watermen on the Ri|ver
above the Bridge, found means to convey them|&s;elves
away up the River as far as they cou'd go;
and that they had, many of them, their whole Fa|milies
in their Boats, cover'd with Tilts and Bales,
as they call them, and furni&s;h'd with Straw within
for their Lodging; and that they lay thus all along
by the Shoar in the Mar&s;hes, &s;ome of them &s;etting
up little Tents with their Sails, and &s;o lying under
them on Shoar in the Day, and going into their
<PB N="175" REF="177">
Boats at Night; and in this manner, as I have
heard, the River-&s;ides were lin'd with Boats and
People as long as they had any thing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t on,
or cou'd get any thing of the Country; and indeed
the Country People, as well Gentlemen as others,
on the&s;e and all other Occa&s;ions, were very forward
to relieve them, but they were by no means willing
to receive them into their Towns and Hou&s;es, and
for that we cannot blame them.</P>
<P>There was one unhappy Citizen, within my
Knowledge, who had been Vi&s;ited in a dreadful
manner, &s;o that his Wife and all his Children were
Dead, and him&s;elf and two Servants only left, with
an elderly Woman a near Relation, who had nurs'd
tho&s;e that were dead as well as &s;he could: This di&s;|con&s;olate
Man goes to a Village near the Town,
tho' not within the Bills of Mortality, and finding
an empty Hou&s;e there, enquires out the Owner,
and took the Hou&s;e: After a few Days he got a Cart
and loaded it with Goods, and carries them down
to the Hou&s;e; the People of the Village oppos'd his
driving the Cart along, but with &s;ome Arguings,
and &s;ome Force, the Men that drove the Cart along,
got through the Street up to the Door of the Hou&s;e,
there the Con&s;table re&s;i&s;ted him again, and would
not let them be brought in. The Man caus'd the
Goods to be unloaden and lay'd at the Door, and
&s;ent the Cart away; upon which they carry'd the
Man before a Ju&s;tice of Peace; that is to &s;ay, they
commanded him to go, which he did. The Ju&s;tice
order'd him to cau&s;e the Cart to fetch away the
Goods again, which he refu&s;ed to do; upon which
the Ju&s;tice order'd the Con&s;table to pur&s;ue the Car|ters
and fetch them back, and make them re-load
the Goods and carry them away, or to &s;et them in
the Stocks till they came for farther Orders; and if
they could not find them, nor the Man would not
con&s;ent to take them away, they &s;hould cau&s;e them
<PB N="176" REF="178">
to be drawn with Hooks from the Hou&s;e-Door and
burnt in the Street. The poor di&s;tre&s;s'd Man up|on
this fetch'd the Goods again, but with grievous
Cries and Lamentations at the hard&s;hip of his Ca&s;e.
But there was no Remedy; Self-pre&s;ervation oblig'd
the People to tho&s;e Severities, which they wou'd not
otherwi&s;e have been concern'd in: Whether this
poor Man liv'd or dy'd I cannot tell, but it was re|ported
that he had the Plague upon him at that
time; and perhaps the People might report that to
ju&s;tify their U&s;age of him; but it was not unlikely,
that either he or his Goods, or both, were dangerous,
when his whole Family had been dead of the Di|&s;temper
&s;o little a while before.</P>
<P>I kno' that the Inhabitants of the Towns adja|cent
to <HI>London,</HI> were much blamed for Cruelty to the
poor People that ran from the Contagion in their
Di&s;tre&s;s; and many very &s;evere things were done, as
may be &s;een from what has been &s;aid; but I cannot but
&s;ay al&s;o that where there was room for Charity and
A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the People, without apparent Danger
to them&s;elves, they were willing enough to help and
relieve them. But as every Town were indeed Judg|es
in their own Ca&s;e, &s;o the poor People who ran
a-broad in their Extremities, were often ill-u&s;ed and
driven back again into the Town; and this cau&s;ed
infinite Exclamations and Out-cries again&s;t the
Country Towns, and made the Clamour very popu|lar.</P>
<P>And yet more or le&s;s, maugre all their Caution,
there was not a Town of any Note within ten (or I
believe twenty) Miles of the City, but what was
more or le&s;s Infected, and had &s;ome died among
them. I have heard the Accounts of &s;everal; &s;uch as
they were reckon'd up as follows.</P>

<P>Another thing might render the Country more
&s;trict with re&s;pect to the Citizens, and e&s;pecially
with re&s;pect to the Poor; and this was what I hint|ed
at before, namely, that there was a &s;eeming pro|pen&s;ity,
or a wicked Inclination in tho&s;e that were
Infected to infect others.</P>
<P>There have been great Debates among our Phy|&s;icians,
as to the Rea&s;on of this; &s;ome will have it
to be in the Nature of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and that it impre&s;|&s;es
every one that is &s;eized upon by it, with a kind of
a Rage, and a hatred again&s;t their own Kind, as if
there was a malignity, not only in the Di&s;temper to
communicate it &s;elf, but in the very Nature of Man,
prompting him with evil Will, or an evil Eye, that <HI>as
they &s;ay</HI> in the Ca&s;e of a mad Dog, who tho' the gent|le&s;t
Creature before of any of his Kind, yet then will
fly upon and bite any one that comes next him
and tho&s;e as &s;oon as any, who had been mo&s;t ob&s;erv'd
by him before.</P>
<P>Others plac'd it to the Account of the Corup|tion
of humane Nature, which cannot bear to &s;ee
it&s;elf more mi&s;erable than others of its own Specie,
and has a kind of involuntary Wi&s;h, that all Men
were as unhappy, or in as bad a Condition as it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Others &s;ay, it was only a kind of De&s;peration,
not knowing or regarding what they did, and con|&s;equently
unconcern'd at the Danger or Safe$y, not
only of any Body near them, but even of them&s;elves
<PB N="178" REF="180">
al&s;o: And indeed when Men are once come to a
Condition to abandon them&s;elves, and be uncon|cern'd
for the Safety, or at the Danger of them&s;elves,
it cannot be &s;o much wondered that they &s;hould be
carele&s;s of the Safety of other People.</P>
<P>But I choo&s;e to give this grave Debate a quite
different turn, and an&s;wer it or re&s;oive it all by
&s;aying, <HI>That I do not grant the Fact.</HI> On the con|trary,
I &s;ay, that the Thing is not really &s;o, but
that it was a general Complaint rais'd by the Peo|ple
inhabiting the out-lying Villages again&s;t the Ci|tizens,
to ju&s;tify, or at lea&s;t excu&s;e tho&s;e Hard&s;hips
and Severities &s;o much talk'd of, and in which Com|plaints,
both Sides may be &s;aid to have injur'd one
another; that is to &s;ay, the Citizens pre&s;&s;ing to be
received and harbour'd in time of Di&s;tre&s;s, and with
the Plague upon them, complain of the Cruelty and
Inju&s;tice of the Country Peeople, in being refu&s;ed En|trance,
and forc'd back again with their Goods and Fa|milies;
and the Inhabitants finding them&s;elves &s;o im|po&s;ed
upon, and the Citizens breaking in as it were
upon them whether they would or no, complain,
that when they were infected, they were not only
regardle&s;s of others, but even willing to infect them;
neither of which were really true, that is to &s;ay, in
the Colours they were de&s;crib'd in.</P>
<P>It is true, there is &s;omething to be &s;aid for the fre|quent
Alarms which were given to the Country, of
the re&s;olution of the People in <HI>London</HI> to come out by
Force, not only for Relief, but to Plunder and Rob,
that they ran about the Streets with the Di|&s;temper
upon them without any control; and that
no Care was taken to &s;hut up Hou&s;es, and confine
the &s;ick People from infecting others; whereas, to
do the <HI>Londoners</HI> Ju&s;tice, they never practi&s;ed &s;uch
things, except in &s;uch particular Ca&s;es as I have men|tion'd
above, and &s;uch-like. On the other Handeve|$y
$word$ was managed with &s;o much Care, and &s;uch
$span$ was ob&s;erv'd in the whole City and
<PB N="179" REF="181">
Suburbs, by the Care of the Lord Mayor and Alder|men;
and by the Ju&s;tices of the Peace, Churchwar|dens,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the out-Parts; that <HI>London</HI> may be a Pat|tern
to all the Cities in the World for the good Govern|ment
and the excellent Order that was every where
kept, even in the time of the mo&s;t violent Infection;
and when the People were in the utmo&s;t Con&s;terna|tion
and Di&s;tre&s;s. But of this I &s;hall &s;peak by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>One thing, it is to be ob&s;erv'd, was owing prin|cipatly
to the Prudence of the Magi&s;trates, and ought
to be mention'd to their Honour, (<HI>viz.</HI>) The Mo|deration
which they u&s;ed in the great and difficult
Work of &s;hutting up of Hou&s;es: It is true, as I have
mentioned, that the &s;hutting up of Hou&s;es was a
great Subject of Di&s;content, and I may &s;ay indeed
the only Subject of Di&s;content among the People at
that time; for the confining the Sound in the &s;ame
Hou&s;e with the Sick, was counted very terrible, and
the Complaints of People &s;o confin'd were very grie|vous;
they were heard into the very Streets, and
they were &s;ometimes &s;uch that called for Re&s;ent|ment,
tho' oftner for Compa&s;&s;ion; they had no way
to conver&s;e with any of their Friends but out at their
Windows, where they wou'd make &s;uch piteous La|mentations,
as often mov'd the Hearts of tho&s;e they
talk'd with, and of others who pa&s;&s;ing by heard their
Story; and as tho&s;e Complaints oftentimes reproach'd
the Severity, and &s;ometimes the In&s;olence of the
Watchmen plac'd at their Doors, tho&s;e Watchmen
wou'd an&s;wer &s;aucily enough; and perhaps be apt to
affront the People who were in the Street talking to the
&s;aid Families; for which, or for their ill Treatment of
the Families, I think &s;even or eight of them in &s;e|veral
Places were kill'd; I know not whether I &s;hou'd
&s;ay murthered or not, becau&s;e I cannot enter into
the particular Ca&s;es. It is true, the Watchmen were
on their Duty, and acting in the Po&s;t where they
were plac'd by a lawful Authority; and killing any
publick legal Officer in the Execution of his Office,
<PB N="180" REF="182">
is always in the Language of the Law call'd Murther.
But as they were not authoriz'd by the Magi&s;trate's
In&s;tructions, or by the Power they acted under, to
be injurious or abu&s;ive, either to the People who
were under their Ob&s;ervation, or to any that con|cern'd
them&s;elves for them; &s;o when they did &s;o, they
might be &s;aid to act them&s;elves&punc; not their Office;
to act as private Per&s;ons, not as Per&s;ons employ'd;
and con&s;equently if they brought Mi&s;chief upon
them&s;elves by &s;uch an undue Behaviour, that Mi&s;|chief
was upon their own Heads; and indeed they
had &s;o much the hearty Cur&s;es of the People, whether
they de&s;erv'd it or not, that whatever befel them no
body pitied them, and every Body was apt to &s;ay,
they de&s;erv'd it, whatever it was; not do I remem|ber
that any Body was ever puni&s;h'd, at lea&s;t to any
con&s;iderable Degree, for whatever was done to the
Watchmen that guarded their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>What variety of Stratagems were u&s;ed to e&s;cape
and get out of Hou&s;es thus &s;hut up, by which the
Watchmen were deceived or overpower'd, and that
the People got away, I have taken notice of alrea|dy,
and &s;hall &s;ay no more to that: But I &s;ay the Ma|gi&s;trates
did moderate and ea&s;e Families upon many
Occa&s;ions in this Ca&s;e, and particularly in that of ta|king
away, or &s;uffering to be remov'd the &s;ick Per&s;ons
out of &s;uch Hou&s;es, when they were willing to be re|mov'd
either to a Pe&s;t-Hou&s;e, or other Places, and
&s;ometimes giving the well Per&s;ons in the Family &s;o
&s;hut up, leave to remove upon Information given
that they were well, and that they would confine them|&s;elves
in &s;uch Hou&s;es where they went, &s;o long as
&s;hould be requir'd of them. The Concern al&s;o of the
Magi&s;trates for the &s;upplying &s;uch poor Families as
were infected; I &s;ay, &s;upplying them with Nece&s;&s;a|ries,
as well Phy&s;ick as Food, was very great, and in
which they did not content them&s;elves with giving
the nece&s;&s;ary Orders to the Officers appointed, but
the Aldermen in Per&s;on, and on Hor&s;eback frequently
<PB N="181" REF="183">
rid to &s;uch Hou&s;es, and caus'd the People to be ask'd
at their Windows, whether they were duly attend|ed,
or not? Al&s;o, whether they wanted any thing
that was nece&s;&s;ary, and if the Officers had con&s;tant|ly
carry'd their Me&s;&s;ages, and fetch'd them &s;uch things
as they wanted, or not? And if they an&s;wered in the
Affirmative, all was well; but if they complain'd,
that they were ill &s;upply'd, and that the Officer did
not do his Duty, or did not treat them civilly, they
(the Officers) were generally remov'd, and others
plac'd in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>It is true, &s;uch Complaint might be unju&s;t, and
if the Officer had &s;uch Arguments to u&s;e as would
convince the Magi&s;trate, that he was right, and that the
People had injur'd him, he was continued, and they
reproved. But this part could not well bear a par|ticular
Inquiry, for the Parties could very ill be
brought face to face, and a Complaint could not be
well heard and an&s;wer'd in the Street, from the Win|dows,
as was the Ca&s;e then; the Magi&s;trates there|fore
generally cho&s;e to favour the People, and remove
the Man, as what &s;eem'd to be the lea&s;t Wrong, and of
the lea&s;t ill Con&s;equence; &s;eeing, if the Watchman was
injur'd yet they could readily make him amends by
giving him another Po&s;t of the like Nature; but if
the Family was injur'd, there was no Satisfaction
could be made to them, the Damage perhaps being
irreparable, as it concern'd their Lives.</P>
<P>A great variety of the&s;e Ca&s;es frequently happen'd
between the Watchmen and the poor People &s;hut up,
be&s;ides tho&s;e I formerly mention'd about e&s;caping;
&s;ometimes the Watchmen were ab&s;ent, &s;ometimes
durnk, &s;ometimes a&s;leep when the People wanted
them, and &s;uch never fail'd to be puni&s;h'd &s;everely, as
indeed they de&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>But after all that was or could be done in the&s;e Ca|&s;es,
the &s;hutting up of Hou&s;es, &s;o as to confine tho&s;e
that were well, with tho&s;e that were &s;ick, had very
great Inconveniences in it, and &s;ome that were very
<PB N="182" REF="184">
tragical, and which merited to have been con&s;ider'd
if there had been room for it; but it was authoriz'd
by a Law, it had the publick Good in view, as the
End chiefly aim'd at, and all the private Injuries that
were done by the putting it in Execution, mu&s;t be
put to the account of the publick Benefit.</P>
<P>It is doubtful to this day, whether in the
whole it contributed any thing to the &s;top of the
Infection, and indeed, I cannot &s;ay it did; for no|thing
could run with greater Fury and Rage than
the Infection did when it was in its chief Violence;
tho' the Hou&s;es infected were &s;hut up as exactly, and
as effectually as it was po&s;&s;ible. Certain it is, that if
all the infected Per&s;ons were effectually &s;hut in, no
&s;ound Per&s;on could have been infected by them, be|cau&s;e
they could not have come near them. But the
Ca&s;e was this, and I &s;hall only touch it here, name|ly,
that the Infection was propagated in&s;en&s;ibly, and
by &s;uch Per&s;ons as were not vi&s;ibly infected, who nei|ther
knew who they infected, or who they were in|fected
by.</P>
<P>A Hou&s;e in <HI>White-Chapel</HI> was &s;hut up for the &s;ake
of one infected Maid, who had only Spots, not the
Tokens come out upon her, and recover'd; yet the&s;e
People obtain'd no Liberty to &s;tir, neither for Air or
Exerci&s;e forty Days; want of Breath, Fear, Anger,
Vexation, and all the other Griefs attending &s;uch an
injurious Treatment, ca&s;t the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Fami|ly
into a Fever, and Vi&s;itors came into the Hou&s;e,
and &s;aid it was the Plague, tho' the Phy&s;icians declar'd
it was not; however the Family were oblig'd to be|gin
their Quarantine anew, on the Report of the Vi|&s;itor
or Examiner, tho' their former Quarantine
wanted but a few Days of being fini&s;h'd. This op|pre&s;s'd
them &s;o with Anger and Grief, and, <HI>as before,</HI>
&s;traiten'd them al&s;o &s;o much as to Room, and for
want of Breathing and free Air, that mo&s;t of the Fa|mily
fell &s;ick, one of one Di&s;temper, one of another,
chiefly Scorbutick Ailments; <HI>only one a violent Cholick,</HI>
<PB N="183" REF="185">
'till after &s;everal prolongings of their Confinement'
&s;ome or other of tho&s;e that came in with the Vi&s;itors
to in&s;pect the Per&s;ons that were ill, in hopes of re|lea&s;ing
them, brought the Diftemper with them, and
infected the whole Hou&s;e, and all or mo&s;t of them
died, not of the Plague, as really upon them before,
but of the Plague that tho&s;e People brought them, who
&s;hould ha' been careful to have protected them from it;
and this was a thing which frequently happen'd, and
was indeed one of the wor&s;t Con&s;equences of &s;hutting
Hou&s;es up.</P>
<P>I had about this time a little Hard&s;hip put upon
me, which I was at fir&s;t greatly afflicted at, and very
much di&s;turb'd about; tho' as it prov'd, it did not ex|po&s;e
me to any Di&s;a&s;ter; and this was being appointed
by the Alderm in of <HI>Port&s;oken</HI> Ward, one of the Exa|miners
of the Hou&s;es in the Precinct where I liv'd;
we had a large Pari&s;h, and had no le&s;s than eighteen
Examiners, as the Order call'd us, the People call'd
us Vi&s;itors. I endeavour'd with all my might to be
excus'd from &s;uch an Employment&punc; and u&s;ed many Ar|guments
with the Alderman's Deputy to be excus'd;
particularly I alledged, that I was again&s;t &s;hutting
up Hou&s;es at all, and that it would be very hard to
oblige me, to be an In&s;trument in that which was a|gain&s;t
my Judgment, and which I did verily believe
would not an&s;wer the End it was intended for, but all
the Abatement I could get was only, that whereas
the Officer was appointed by my Lord Mayor to con|tinue
two Months, I &s;hould be obliged to hold it but
three Weeks, on Condition, neverthele&s;s that I could
then get &s;ome other &s;ufficient Hou&s;e-keeper to &s;erve
the re&s;t of the Time for me, which was, in &s;hort, but
a very &s;mall Favour, it being very difficult to get any
Man to accept of &s;uch an Employment, that was fit
to be intru&s;ted with it.</P>
<P>It is true that &s;hutting up of Hou&s;es had one Ef|fect,
which I am &s;en&s;ible was of Moment, namely,
it confin'd the di&s;temper'd People, who would other|wi&s;e
<PB N="184" REF="186">
have been both very trouble&s;ome and very dan|gerous
in their running about Streets with the Di|&s;temper
upon them, which when they were dilirious,
they would have done in a mo&s;t frightful manner; and
as indeed they began to do at fir&s;t very much, 'till
they were thus re&s;train'd; nay, &s;o very open they were,
that the Poor would go about and beg at peoples
Doors, and &s;ay they had the Plague upon them, and
beg Rags for their Sores, or both, or any thing
that dilirious Nature happen'd to think of.</P>
<P>A poor uuhappy Gentlcwoman, a &s;ub&s;tantial Ci|tizen's
Wife was (if the Story be true) murther'd
by one of the&s;e Creatures in <HI>Alder&s;gate-&s;treet,</HI> or that
Way: He was going along the Street, raving mad to
be &s;ure, and &s;inging, the People only &s;aid, he was
drunk; but he him&s;elf &s;aid, he had the Plague upon
him, which, it &s;eems, was true; and meeting this
Gentlewoman, he would ki&s;s her; &s;he was terribly
frighted as he was only a rude Fellow, and &s;he run
from him, but the Street being very thin of People,
there was no body near enough to help her: When &s;he
&s;ee he would overtake her, &s;he turn'd, and gave him
a Thru&s;t &s;o forcibly, he being but weak, and pu&s;h'd
him down backward: But very unhappily, &s;he being
&s;o near, he caught hold of her, and pull'd her down
al&s;o; and getting up fir&s;t, ma&s;ter'd her, and ki&s;s'd
her; and which was wor&s;t of all, when he had done,
told her he had the Plague, and why &s;hould not &s;he
have it as well as he. She was frighted enough be|fore,
being al&s;o young with Child; but when &s;he
heard him &s;ay, he had the Plague, &s;he &s;cream'd out
and fell down in a Swoon, or in a Fit, which tho'
&s;he recover'd a little, yet kill'd her in a very few
Days, and I never heard whether &s;he had the Plague
or no.</P>
<P>Another infected Per&s;on came, and knock'd at the
Door of a Citizen's Hou&s;e, where they knew him very
well; the Servant let him in, and being told the Ma|&s;ter
of the Hou&s;e was above, he ran up, and came
<PB N="185" REF="187">
into the Room to them as the whole Family was at
upper: They began to ri&s;e up a little &s;urpriz'd,
not kw$ing what the Matter was, but he bid
them &s;it &s;till, he only came to take his leave of them.
They ask'd him, Why Mr.&mdash;where are you go|ing?
Going, &s;ays he, I have got the Sickne&s;s, and
&s;hall die to morrow Night. 'Tis ea&s;ie to believe,
though not to de&s;cribe the Con&s;ternation they were
all in, the Women and the Man's Daughters which
were but little Girls, were frighted almo&s;t to Death,
and got up, one running out at one Door, and one
at another, &s;ome down-Stairs and &s;ome up-Stairs,
and getting together as well as they could, lock'd
them&s;elves into their Chambers, and &s;creamed out
at the Window for Help, as if they had been frighted
out of their Wits: The Ma&s;ter more compos'd than
they, tho' both frighted and provok'd, was going
to lay Hands on him, and thro' him down Stairs,
being in a Pa&s;&s;ion, but then con&s;idering a little the
Condition of the Man and the Danger of touching
him, Horror &s;eiz'd his Mind, and he &s;tood &s;till like
one a&s;toni&s;hed. The poor di&s;temper'd Man all this
while, being as well di&s;eas'd in his Brain as in his
Body, &s;tood &s;till like one amaz'd; at length he turns
round, <HI>Ay! &s;ays he,</HI> with all the &s;eeming calmne&s;s
imaginable, <HI>Is it &s;o with you all! Are you all di&s;turb'd
at me? why then I'll e'en go home and die there.</HI> And
&s;o he goes immediately down Stairs: The Servant
that had let him in goes down after him with a Can|dle,
but was afraid to go pa&s;t him and open the
Door, &s;o he &s;tood on the Stairs to &s;ee what he wou'd
do; the Man went and open'd the Door, and went
out and flung the Door after him: It was &s;ome
while before the Family recover'd the Fright, but
as no ill Con&s;equence attended, they have had occa|&s;ion
&s;ince to &s;peak of it (you may be &s;ure) with
great Satisfaction. Tho' the Man was gone it was
&s;ome time, nay as I heard, &s;ome Days before they re|cover'd
them&s;elves of the Hurry they were in, nor
<PB N="186" REF="188">
did they go up and down the Hou&s;e with any a&s;&s;u|rance,
till they had burnt a great variety of Fumes
and Perfumes in all the Rooms, and made a great
many Smoaks of Pitch, of Gunpowder, and of Sul|phur,
all &s;eparately &s;hifted; and wa&s;hed their Clothes,
and the like: As to the poor Man whether he liv'd or
dy'd I don't remember.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certain, that if by the Shutting up of
Hou&s;es the &s;ick had not been confin'd, multitudes
who in the height of their Fever were Dilirious and
Di&s;tracted, wou'd ha' been continually running up
and down the Streets, and even as it was a very
great number did &s;o, and offer'd all &s;orts of Violence
to tho&s;e they met, even ju&s;t as a mad Dog runs on
and bites at every one he meets; nor can I doubt but
that &s;hou'd one of tho&s;e infected di&s;ea&s;ed Creatures
have bitten any Man or Woman, while the Frenzy
of the Di&s;temper was upon them, they, I mean the
Per&s;on &s;o wounded, wou'd as certainly ha' been in|curably
infected, as one that was &s;ick before and had
the Tokens upon him.</P>
<P>I heard of one infected Creature, who running out
of his Bed in his Shirt, in the angui&s;h and agony of
his Swellings, of which he had three upon him, got
his Shoes on and went to put on his Coat, but the
Nur&s;e re&s;i&s;ting and &s;natching the Coat from him, he
threw her down, run over her, run down Stairs
and into the Street directly to the <HI>Thames</HI> in his
Shirt, the Nur&s;e running after him, and calling to
the Watch to &s;top him; but the Watchmen fright|ed
at the Man, and afraid to touch him, let him go
on; upon which he ran down to the Still-yard Stairs,
threw away his Shirt, and plung'd into the <HI>Thames,</HI>
and, being a good &s;wimmer, &s;wam quite over the
River; and the Tide being coming in, as they call
it, that is running We&s;t-ward, he reached the Land
not till he came about the Falcon Stairs, where land|ing,
and finding no People there, it being in the Night,
he ran about the Streets there, Naked as he was, for
<PB N="187" REF="189">
a good while, when it being by that time High-water,
he takes the River again, and &s;wam back to the Still-yard,
landed, ran up the Streets again to his own
Hou&s;e, knocking at the Door, went up the Stairs,
and into his Bed again; and that this terrible Expe|riment
cur'd him of the Plague, that is to &s;ay, that
the violent Motion of his Arms and Legs &s;tretch'd
the Parts where the Swellings he had upon him were,
that is to &s;ay under his Arms and his Groin, and
cau&s;ed them to ripen and break; and that the cold
of the Water abated the Fever in his Blood.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that I do not relate this any
more than &s;ome of the other, as a Fact within my
own Knowledge, &s;o as that I can vouch the Truth of
them, and e&s;pecially that of the Man being cur'd by
the extravagant Adventure, which I confe&s;s I do not
think very po&s;&s;ible, but it may &s;erve to confirm the
many de&s;perate Things which the di&s;tre&s;s'd People
falling into, Diliriums, and what we call Lighthead|edne&s;s,
were frequently run upon at that time, and
how infinitely more &s;uch there wou'd ha' been, if
&s;uch People had not been confin'd by the &s;hutting up
of Hou&s;es; and this I take to be the be&s;t, <HI>if n$t the
only good thing</HI> which was perform'd by that &s;evere
Method.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Complaints and the Mur|murings
were very bitter again&s;t the thing it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It would pierce the Hearts of all that came by
to hear the piteous Cries of tho&s;e infected People, who
being thus out of their Under&s;tandings by the Vio|lence
of their Pain, or the heat of their Blood, were
either &s;hut in, or perhaps ty'd in their Beds and Chairs,
to prevent their doing them&s;elves Hurt, and who
wou'd make a dreadful outcry at their being confin'd,
and at their being not permitted to die at large, as
they call'd it, and as they wou'd ha' done before.</P>
<P>This running of di&s;temper'd People about the
Streets was very di&s;mal, and the Magi&s;trates did
their utmo&s;t to prevent it, but as it was generally in
<PB N="188" REF="190">
the Night and always &s;udden, when &s;uch attempts were
made, the Officers cou'd not be at hand to prevent it,
and even when any got out in the Day, the Officers
appointed did not care to meddle with them, becau&s;e,
as they were all grievou&s;ly infected to <HI>be&s;ure</HI> when they
were come to that Height, &s;o they were more than
ordinarily infectious, and it was one of the mo&s;t dan|gerous
Things that cou'd be to touch them; on the
other Hand, they generally ran, on not knowing what
they did, till they dropp'd down &s;tark Dead, or till
they had exhau&s;ted their Sptrits &s;o, as that they wou'd
fall and then die in perhaps half an Hour or an Hour,
and which was mo&s;t piteous to hear, they were &s;ure
to come to them&s;elves intirely in that half Hour or
Hour, and then to make mo&s;t grievous and piercing
Cries and Lamentations in the deep afflicting Sen&s;e
of the Condition they were in. This was much of it
before the Order for &s;hutting up of Hou&s;es was &s;trict|ly
put in Execution, for at fir&s;t the Watchmen were
not &s;o vigorous and &s;evere, as they were after|ward
in the keeping the People in; that is to &s;ay, be|fore
they were, I mean &s;ome of them, &s;everely pu|ni&s;h'd
for their Neglect, failing in their Duty, and
letting People who were under their Care &s;lip away,
or connniving at their going abroad whether &s;ick or
well. But after they &s;aw the Officers appointed to
examine into their Conduct, were re&s;olv'd to have
them do their Duty, or be puni&s;h'd for the omi&s;&s;ion,
they were more exact, and the People were &s;trictly
re&s;train'd; which was a thing they took &s;o ill, and
bore &s;o impatiently, that their Di&s;contents can hard|ly
be de&s;crib'd: Bet there was an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity
for it, that mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, unle&s;s &s;ome other Mea|&s;ures
had been timely enter'd upon, and it was too
late for that.</P>
<P>Had not this particular of the Sick's been re&s;train'd
as above, been our Ca&s;e at that time, <HI>London</HI> wou'd
ha' been the mo&s;t dreadful Place that ever was in
the World, there wou'd for ought I kno' have as
<PB N="189" REF="191">
many People dy'd in the Streets as dy'd in their
Hou&s;es; for when the Di&s;tmper was at its height,
it generally made them Raving and Dilirious, and
when they were &s;o, they wou'd never be per&s;waded
to keep in their Beds but by Force; and many
who were not ty'd, threw them&s;elves out of Windows,
when they found they cou'd not get leave to go out
of their Doors.</P>
<P>It was for want of People conver&s;ing one with a|nother,
in this time of Calamity, that it was
impo&s;&s;ible any particular Per&s;on cou'd come at the
Knowledge of all the extraordinary Ca&s;es that $c|curr'd
in different Families; and particularly I be|lieve
it was never known to this Day how many
People in their Diliriums drowned them&s;elves in the
<HI>Thames,</HI> and in the River which runs from the Mar|&s;hes
by <HI>Hackney,</HI> which we generally call'd <HI>Ware</HI> River,
or <HI>Hackney</HI> River; as to tho&s;e which were &s;et down
in the Weekly Bill, they were indeed few; nor cou'd
it be known of any of tho&s;e, whether they drowned
them&s;elves by Accident or not: But I believe, I
might reckon up more, who, within the compa&s;s of
my Knowledge or Ob&s;ervation, really drowned them|&s;elves
in that Year, than are put down in the Bill of
all put together, for many of the Bodies were never
found, who, yet were known to be &s;o lo&s;t; and the like
in other Methods of Self-De&s;truction. There was al&s;o
One Man in or about <HI>Whitecro&s;s-&s;treet,</HI> burnt him&s;elf
to Death in his Bed; &s;ome &s;aid it was done by him|&s;elf,
others that it was by the Treachery of the
Nur&s;e that attended him; but that he had the Plague
upon him was agreed by all.</P>
<P>It was a merciful Di&s;po&s;ition of Providence al&s;o,
and which I have many times thought of at that
time, that no Fires, or no con&s;iderable ones at lea&s;t,
happen'd in the City, during that Year, which, if it
had been otherwi&s;e, would have been very dreadful;
and either the People mu&s;t have let them alone un|quenched,
or have come together in great Crowds
<PB N="190" REF="192">
and Throngs, unconcern'd at the Danger of the In|fection,
not concerned at the Hou&s;es they went into,
at the Goods they handled, or at the Per&s;ons or the
People they came among: But &s;o it was that ex|cepting
that in <HI>Cripplegate</HI> Pari&s;h, and two or three
little Eruptions of Fires, which were pre&s;ently ex|tingui&s;h'd,
there was no Di&s;a&s;ter of that kind hap|pen'd
in the whole Year. They told us a Story of
a Hou&s;e in a Place call'd <HI>Swan-A$ey,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing from
<HI>Go&s;well-&s;treet</HI> near the End of <HI>Old&s;treet</HI> into <HI>St. John-&s;treet,</HI>
that a Family was infected there, in &s;o terri|ble
a Manner that every one of the Hou&s;e died; the
la&s;t Per&s;on lay dead on the Floor, and as it is &s;uppo&s;ed,
had laid her &s;elf all along to die ju&s;t before the Fire;
the Fire, it &s;eems had fallen from its Place, being of
Wood, and had taken hold of the Boards and the Joi&s;ts
they lay on, and burnt as far as ju&s;t to the Body, but
had not taken hold of the dead Body, tho' &s;he had lit|tle
more than her Shift on, and had gone out of it&s;elf,
not hurting the Re&s;t of the Hou&s;e, tho' it was a
&s;light Timber Hou&s;e. How true this might be, I
do not determine, but the City being to &s;uffer &s;e|verely
the next Year by Fire, this Year it felt very
little of that Calamity.</P>
<P>Indeed con&s;idering the Deliriums, which the Ago|ny
threw People into, and how I have mention'd in
their Madne&s;s, when they were alone, they did ma|ny
de&s;perate Things; it was very &s;trange there were
no more Di&s;a&s;ters of that kind.</P>
<P>It has been frequently ask'd me, and I cannot &s;ay,
that I ever knew how to give a direct An&s;wer to it,
How it came to pa&s;s that &s;o many infected People
appear'd abroad in the Streets, at the &s;ame time that
the Hou&s;es which were infected were &s;o vigilantly
&s;earched, and all of them &s;hut up and guarded as they
were.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I know not what An&s;wer to give to this,
unle&s;s it be this, that in &s;o great and populous a City
as this is, it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover every Hou&s;e
<PB N="191" REF="193">
that was infected as &s;oon as it was &s;o, or to &s;hut up
all the Hou&s;es that were infected: &s;o that People
had the Liberty of going about the Streets, even
where they plea&s;ed, unle&s;s they were known to be|long
to &s;uch and &s;uch infected Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>It is true, that as &s;everal Phy&s;icians told my Lord
Mayor, the Fury of the Contagion was &s;uch at &s;ome
particular Times, and People &s;icken'd &s;o fa&s;t, and
died, &s;o &s;oon, that it was impo&s;&s;ible and indeed to no
purpo&s;e to go about to enquire who was &s;ick and who
was well, or to &s;hut them up with &s;uch Exactne&s;s,
as the thing required; almo&s;t every Hou&s;e in a whole
Street being infected, and in many Places every Per|&s;on
in &s;ome of the Hou&s;es; and that which was &s;till
wor&s;e, by the time that the Hou&s;es were known to
be infected, mo&s;t of the Per&s;ons infected would be
&s;tone dead, and the re&s;t run away for Fear of be|ing
&s;hut up; &s;o that it was to very &s;mall Purpo&s;e, to
call them infected Hou&s;es and &s;hut them up; the
Infection having ravaged, and taken its Leave of the
Hou&s;e, before it was really known, that the Family
was any way touch'd.</P>
<P>This might be &s;ufficient to convince any rea&s;on|able
Per&s;on, that as it was not in the Power of the
Magi&s;trates, or of any humane Methods or Policy,
to prevent the &s;preading the Infection; &s;o that this
way of &s;hutting up of Hou&s;es was perfectly in&s;uffi|cient
for that End. Indeed it &s;eemed to have no man|ner
of publick Good in it, equal or proportionable
to the grievous Burthen that it was to the particular
Families, that were &s;o &s;hut up; and as far as I was
employed by the publick in directing that Severity,
I frequently found occa&s;ion to &s;ee, that it was inca|pable
of an&s;wering the End. For Example as I
was de&s;ired as a Vi&s;itor or Examiner to enquire
into the Particulars of &s;everal Families which were
infected, we &s;carce came to any Hou&s;e where
the Plague had vi&s;ibly appear'd in the Family, but
that &s;ome of the Family were Fled and gone; the
<PB N="192" REF="194">
Magi&s;trates would re&s;ent this, and charge the Exa|miners
with being remi&s;s in their Examination or
In&s;pection: But by that means Hou&s;es were long in|fected
before it was known. Now, as I was in this
dangerous Office but half the appointed time, which
was two Months, it was long enough to inform
my&s;elf, that we were no way capable of coming at
the Knowledge of the true &s;tate of any Family, but
by enquiring at the Door, or of the Neighbours; as
for going into every Hou&s;e to &s;earch, that was a part,
no Authority wou'd offer to impo&s;e on the Inhabi|tants,
or any Citizen wou'd undertake, for it wou'd
ha' been expo&s;ing us to certain Infection and Death,
and to the Ruine of our own Families as well as of
our&s;elves, nor wou'd any Citizen of Probity, and
that cou'd be depended upon, have &s;taid in the Town,
if they had been made liable to &s;uch a Severity.</P>
<P>Seeing then that we cou'd come at the certainty
of Things by no Method but that of Enquiry of the
Neighbours, or of the Family, and on that we cou'd
not ju&s;tly depend, it was not po&s;&s;ible, but that the
incertainty of this Matter wou'd remain as above.</P>
<P>It is true, Ma&s;ters of Families were bound by the
Order, to give Notice to the Examiner of the Place
wherein he liv'd, within two Hours after he &s;hou'd
di&s;cover it, of any Per&s;on being &s;ick in his Hou&s;e,
that is to &s;ay, having Signs of the Infection, but they
found &s;o many ways to evade this, and excu&s;e their
Negligence, that they &s;eldom gave that Notice, till
they had taken Mea&s;ures to have every one E&s;cape out
of the Hou&s;e, who had a mind to E&s;cape, whether
they were Sick or Sound; and while this was &s;o, it
is ea&s;ie to &s;ee, that the &s;hutting up of Hou&s;es was
no way to be depended upon, as a &s;ufficient Method
for putting a &s;top to the Infection, becau&s;e, as I have
&s;aid el&s;ewhere, many of tho&s;e that &s;o went out of
tho&s;e infected Hou&s;es, had the Plague really upon
them, tho' they might really think them&s;elves Sound:
And &s;ome of the&s;e were the People that walk'd the
<PB N="193" REF="195">
Streets till they fell down Dead, not that they were
&s;uddenly &s;truck with the Di&s;temper, as with a
Bullet that kill'd with the Stroke, but that they
really had the Infection in their Blood long before,
only, that, as it prey'd &s;ecretly on the Vitals, it ap|pear'd
not till it &s;eiz'd the Heart with a mortal Pow|er,
and the Patient died in a Moment, as with a &s;ud|den
Fainting, or an Apoplectick Fit.</P>
<P>I know that &s;ome, even of our Phy&s;icians, thought,
for a time, that tho&s;e People that &s;o died in the
Streets, were &s;eiz'd but that Moment they fell, as if
they had been touch'd by a Stroke from Heaven, as
Men are kill'd by a fla&s;h of Lightning; but they found
Rea&s;on to alter their Opinion afterward; for upon
examining the Bodies of &s;uch after they were Dead,
they always either had Tokens upon them, or other
evident Proofs of the Di&s;temper having been longer
upon them, than they had otherwi&s;e expected.</P>
<P>This often was the Rea&s;on that, as I have &s;aid,
we, that were Examiners, were not able to come at
the Knowledge of the Infection being enter'd into
a Hou&s;e, till it was too late to &s;hut it up; and &s;ome|times
not till the People that were left, were all Dead.
In <HI>Petticoat-Lane</HI> two Hou&s;es together were infected,
and &s;everal People &s;ick; but the Di&s;temper was &s;o
well conceal'd, the Examiner, who was my Neigh|bour,
got no Knowledge of it, till Notice was &s;ent
him that the People were all Dead, and that the
Carts &s;hould call there to fetch them away. The
two Heads of the Families concerted their Mea&s;ures,
and &s;o order'd their Matters, as that when the Ex|aminer
was in the Neighbourhood, they appeared
generally one at a time, and an&s;wered, that is, lied
for one another, or got &s;ome of the Neighbourhood
to &s;ay they were all in Health, and perhaps knew no
better, till Death making it impo&s;&s;ible to keep it any
longer as a Secret, the dead-Carts were call'd in
the Night, the Hou&s;es to both, and &s;o it became
<PB N="194" REF="196">
publick: But when the Examiner order'd the Con|&s;table
to &s;hut up the Hou&s;es, there was no Body left
in them but three People, two in one Hou&s;e, and one
in the other ju&s;t dying, and a Nur&s;e in each Hou&s;e,
who acknowledg'd that they had buried five before,
that the Hou&s;es had been infected nine or ten
Days, and that for all the re&s;t of the two Families,
which were many, they were gone, &s;ome &s;ick, &s;ome
well, or whether &s;ick or well could not be known.</P>
<P>In like manner, at another Hou&s;e in the &s;ame
Lane, a Man having his Family infected, but very
unwilling to be &s;hut up, when he could conceal it
no longer, &s;hut up him&s;elf; that is to &s;ay, he &s;et the
great red Cro&s;s upon his Door with the words LORD
HAVE MERCY UPON US; and &s;o deluded the Exami|ner,
who &s;uppos'd it had been done by the Con&s;table,
by Order of the other Examiner, for there were two
Examiners to every Di&s;trict or Precinct; by this
means he had free egre&s;s and regre&s;s into his Hou&s;e
again, and out of it, as he pleas'd notwith&s;tanding it
was infected; till at length his Stratagem was found
out, and then he, with the &s;ound part of his Servants
and Family, made off and e&s;caped; &s;o they were not
&s;hut up at all.</P>
<P>The&s;e things made it very hard, if not impo&s;&s;ible,
<HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> to prevent the &s;preading of an Infec|tion
by the &s;hutting up of Hou&s;es, unle&s;s the Peo|ple
would think the &s;hutting up of their Hou&s;es no$
Grievance, and be &s;o willing to have it done, a$
that they wou'd give Notice duly and faithfully to
the Magi&s;trates of their being infected, as &s;oon as i$
was known by them&s;elves: But as that can not b$
expected from them, and the Examiners can no$
be &s;uppo&s;ed, as above, to go into their Hou&s;es t$
vi&s;it and and &s;earch, all the good of &s;hutting up Hou$&s;es,
will be defeated, and few Hou&s;es will be &s;hut u$
in time, except tho&s;e of the Poor, who can not con$
ceal it, and of &s;ome People who will be di&s;cover'd b$
<PB N="195" REF="197">
the Terror and Con&s;ternation which the Thing
put them into.</P>
<P>I got my&s;elf di&s;charg'd of the dangerous Office I
was in, as &s;oon as I cou'd get another admitted, who
I had obtain'd for a little Mony to accept of it; and
&s;o, in&s;tead of &s;erving the two Months, which was di|rected,
I was not above three Weeks in it; and a
great while too, con&s;idering it was in the Month of
<HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> at which time the Di&s;temper began to rage
with great Violence at our end of the Town.</P>
<P>In the execution of this Office, I cou'd not refrain
&s;peaking my Opinion among my Neighbours, as to
this &s;hutting up the People in their Hou&s;es; in which
we &s;aw mo&s;t evidently the Severities that were u&s;ed
<HI>tho' grievous in them&s;elves,</HI> had al&s;o this particular Ob|jection
again&s;t them, namely, that they did not an|&s;wer
the End, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> but that the di&s;temper'd
People went Day by Day about the Streets; and it
was our united Opinion, that a Method to have re|moved
the Sound from the Sick in Ca&s;e of a parti|cular
Hou&s;e being vi&s;ited, wou'd ha' been much
more rea&s;onable on many Accounts, leaving no Body
with the &s;ick Per&s;ons, but &s;uch as &s;hou'd on &s;uch
Occa&s;ion reque&s;t to &s;tay and declare them&s;elves con|tent
to be &s;hut up with them.</P>
<P>Our Scheme for removing tho&s;e that were Sound
from tho&s;e that were Sick, was only in &s;uch Hou&s;es
as were infected, and confining the &s;ick was no Con|finement;
tho&s;e that cou'd not &s;tir, wou'd not com|plain,
while they were in their Sen&s;es, and while they
had the Power of judging: Indeed, when they came
to be Dilirious and Light-headed, then they wou'd
cry out of the Cruelty of being confin'd; but for the
removal of tho&s;e that were well, we thought it high|ly
rea&s;onable and ju&s;t, for their own &s;akes, they
&s;hou'd be remov'd from the Sick, and that, for other
People's Safety, they &s;hou'd keep retir'd for a while,
<PB N="196" REF="198">
to &s;ee that they were &s;ound, and might not infect
others; and we thought twenty or thirty Days enough
for this.</P>
<P>Now certainly, if Hou&s;es had been provided on
purpo&s;e for tho&s;e that were &s;ound to perform this de|my
Quarantine in, they wou'd have much le&s;s Rea|&s;on
to think them&s;elves injur'd in &s;uch a re&s;traint,
than in being confin'd with infected People, in the
Hou&s;es where they liv'd.</P>
<P>It is here, however, to be ob&s;erv'd, that after the
Funerals became &s;o many, that People could not
Toll the Bell, Mourn, or Weep, or wear Black for
one another, as they did before; no, nor &s;o much as
make Coffins for tho&s;e that died; &s;o after a while the
fury of the Infection appeared to be &s;o encrea&s;ed,
that in &s;hort, they &s;hut up no Hou&s;es at all; it &s;eem'd
enough that all the Remedies of that Kind had been
u&s;ed till they were found fruitle&s;s, and that the
Plague &s;pread it&s;elf with an irre&s;i&s;tible Fury, &s;o that,
as the Fire the &s;ucceeding Year, &s;pread it&s;elf and
burnt with &s;uch Violence, that the Citizens in
De&s;pair, gave over their Endeavours to extingui&s;h
it, &s;o in the Plague, it came at la&s;t to &s;uch Violence
that the People &s;at &s;till looking at one another, and
&s;eem'd quite abandon'd to De&s;pair; whole Streets
&s;eem'd to be de&s;olated, and not to be &s;hut up only,
but to be emptied of their Inhabitants; Doors were
left open, Windows &s;tood &s;hattering with the Wind in
empty Hou&s;es, for want of People to &s;hut them: In
a Word, People began to give up them&s;elves to their
Fears, and to think that all regulations and Methods
were in vain, and that there was nothing to be ho|ped
for, but an univer&s;al De&s;olation; and it was e|ven
in the height of this general De&s;pair, that it
plea&s;ed God to &s;tay his Hand, and to &s;lacken the
Fury of the Contagion, in &s;uch a manner as was e|ven
&s;urprizing like its beginning, and demon&s;trated
it to be his own particular Hand, and that above, i$
<PB N="197" REF="199">
not without the Agency of Means, as I &s;hall take
Notice of in its proper Place.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t &s;till &s;peak of the Plague as in its height,
raging even to De&s;olation, and the People under
the mo&s;t dreadful Con&s;ternation, even, as I have &s;aid,
to De&s;pair. It is hardly credible to what Exce&s;&s;es
the Pa&s;&s;ions of Men carry'd them in this Extremity
of the Di&s;temper; and this Part, I think, was as
moving as the re&s;t; What cou'd affect a Man in his
full Power of Reflection; and what could make
deeper Impre&s;&s;ions on the Soul, than to &s;ee a Man
almo&s;t Naked and got out of his Hou&s;e, or perhaps
out of his Bed into the Street, come out of <HI>Harrow-Alley,</HI>
a populous Conjunction or Collection of Al|leys,
Courts, and Pa&s;&s;ages, in the Butcher-row
in <HI>Whitechappel?</HI> I &s;ay, What could be more Af|fecting,
than to &s;ee this poor Man come out into the
open Street, run Dancing and Singing, and making
a thou&s;and antick Ge&s;tures, with five or &s;ix Women
and Children running after him, crying, and calling
upon him, for the Lord's &s;ake to come back, and en|treating
the help of others to bring him back, but
all in vain, no Body daring to lay a Hand upon him,
or to come near him.</P>
<P>This was a mo&s;t grievous and afflicting thing to
me, who &s;ee it all from my own Windows; for all
this while, the poor afflicted Man, was, as I ob&s;erv'd
it, even then in the utmo&s;t Agony of Pain, having,
as they &s;aid, two Swellings upon him, which cou'd
not be brought to break, or to &s;uppurate; but by
laying &s;trong Cau&s;ticks on them, the Surgeons had, it
&s;eems, hopes to break them, which Cau&s;ticks were then
upon him, burning his Fle&s;h as with a hot Iron: I
cannot &s;ay what became of this poor Man, but I
think he continu'd roving about in that manner till
he fell down and Died.</P>
<P>No wonder the A&s;pect of the City it&s;elf was fright|ful,
the u&s;ual concour&s;e of People in the Streets,
<PB N="198" REF="200">
and which u&s;ed to be &s;upplied from our end of the
Town, was abated; the Exchange was not kept &s;hut
indeed, but it was no more frequented; the Fires
were lo&s;t; they had been almo&s;t extingui&s;hed for
&s;ome Days by a very &s;mart and ha&s;ty Rain: But
that was not all, &s;ome of the Phy&s;icians in&s;i&s;ted that
they were not only no Benefit, but injurious to the
Health of People: This they made a loud Clamour
about, and complain'd to the Lord Mayor about it:
On the other Hand, others of the &s;ame Faculty,
and Eminent too, oppos'd them, and gave their
Rea&s;ons why the Fires were and mu&s;t be u&s;eful to
a&s;&s;wage the Violence of the Di&s;temper. I cannot
give a full Account of their Arguments on both
Sides, only this I remember, that they cavil'd very
much with one another; &s;ome were for Fires, but
that they mu&s;t be made of Wood and not Coal,
and of particular &s;orts of Wood too, &s;uch as Fir in
particular, or Cedar, becau&s;e of the &s;trong effluvia
of Turpentine; Others were for Coal and not Wood,
becau&s;e of the Sulphur and Bitumen; and others
were for neither one or other. Upon the whole,
the Lord Mayor ordered no more Fires, and e&s;pe|cially
on this Account, namely, that the Plague was &s;o
fierce that they &s;aw evidently it defied all Means and
rather &s;eemed to encrea&s;e than decrea&s;e upon any
application to check and abate it; and yet this
Amazement of the Magi&s;trates, proceeded rather
from want of being able to apply any Means &s;uc|ce&s;sfully,
than from any unwillingne&s;s either to ex|po&s;e
them&s;elves, or undertake the Care and Weight
of Bu&s;ine&s;s; for, to do them Ju&s;tice, they neither
&s;pared their Pains or their Per&s;ons; but nothing
an&s;wer'd, the Infection rag'd, and the People were
now frighted and terrified to the la&s;t Degree, &s;o
that, as I may &s;ay, they gave them&s;elves up, and, as
I mention'd above, abandon'd them&s;elves to their
De&s;pair.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="201">
But let me ob&s;erve here, that when I &s;ay the Peo|ple
abandon'd them&s;elves to De&s;pair, I do not mean
to what Men call a religious De&s;pair, or a De&s;pair
of their eternal State, but I mean a De&s;pair of their
being able to e&s;cape the Infection, or to out-live the
Plague, which they &s;aw was &s;o raging and &s;o irre|&s;i&s;tible
in its Force, that indeed few People that
were touch'd with it in its height about <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and
<HI>September,</HI> e&s;cap'd: And, which is very particular, con|trary
to its ordinary Operation in <HI>June</HI> and <HI>July,</HI>
and the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> when, as I have ob|&s;erv'd
many were infected, and continued &s;o many
Days, and then went off, after having had the Poi|&s;on
in their Blood a long time; but now on the con|trary,
mo&s;t of the People who were taken during
the two la&s;t Weeks in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and in the three
fir&s;t Weeks in <HI>September,</HI> generally died in two
or three Days at farthe&s;t, and many the very
&s;ame Day they were taken; Whether the Dog-days,
or as our A&s;trologers pretended to expre&s;s them|&s;elves,
the Influence of the Dog-Star had that ma|lignant
Effect; or all tho&s;e who had the &s;eeds of
Infection before in them, brought it up to a ma|turity
at that time altogether I know not; but this
was the time when it was reported, that above
3000 People died in one Night; and they that
wou'd have us believe they more critically ob&s;erv'd
it, pretend to &s;ay, that they all died within the &s;pace
of two Hours, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Between the Hours of One
and three in the Morning.</P>
<P>As to the Suddenne&s;s of People's dying at this time
more than before, there were innumerable In&s;tances
of it, and I could name &s;everal in my Neighbour|hood;
one Family without the Barrs, and not far
from me, were all &s;eemingly well on the Monday,
being Ten in Family, that Evening one Maid and
one Apprentice were taken ill, and dy'd the next Mor|ning,
when the other Apprentice and two Children
<PB N="200" REF="202">
were touch'd, whereof one dy'd the &s;ame Evening,
and the other two on Wedne&s;day: In a Word, by
Saturday at Noon, the Ma&s;ter, Mi&s;tre&s;s, four Chil|dren
and four Servants were all gone, and the Hou&s;e
left entirely empty, except an ancient Woman, who
came in to take Charge of the Goods for the Ma&s;ter
of the Family's Brother, who liv'd not far off, and
who had not been &s;ick.</P>
<P>Many Hou&s;es were then left de&s;olate, all the Peo|ple
being carry'd away dead, and e&s;pecially in an
Alley farther, on the &s;ame Side beyond the Barrs,
going in at the Sign of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron;</HI> there were
&s;everal Hou&s;es together, which (they &s;aid) had not one
Per&s;on left alive in them, and &s;ome that dy'd la&s;t in
&s;everal of tho&s;e Hou&s;es, were left a little too long be|fore
they were fetch'd out to be bury'd; the Rea&s;on
of which was not as &s;ome have written very untruly,
that the living were not &s;ufficient to bury the dead;
but that the Mortality was &s;o great in the Yard or
Alley, that there was no Body left to give Notice to
the Buriers or Sextons, that there were any dead Bo|dies
there to be bury'd. It was &s;aid, how true I know
not, that &s;ome of tho&s;e Bodies were &s;o much corrup|ted,
and &s;o rotten, that it was with Difficulty they
were carry'd; and as the Carts could not come any
nearer than to the Alley-Gate in the high Street, it
was &s;o much the more difficult to bring them along;
but I am not certain how many Bodies were then
left, I am &s;ure that ordinarily it was not &s;o.</P>
<P>As I have mention'd how the People were brought
into a Condition to de&s;pair of Life and abandon
them&s;elves, &s;o this very Thing had a &s;trange Effect
among us for three or four Weeks, that is, it made
them bold and venturous, they were no more &s;hy of
one another, or re&s;trained within Doors, but went
any where and every where, and began to conver&s;e;
one would &s;ay to another, I do not ask you how you
are, or &s;ay how I am, it is certain we &s;hall all go,
<PB N="201" REF="203">
&s;o 'tis no Matter who is &s;ick or who is &s;ound, and &s;o
they run de&s;perately into any Place or any Company.</P>
<P>As it brought the People into publick Company,
&s;o it was &s;urprizing how it brought them to crowd
into the Churches, they inquir'd no more into who
they &s;at near to, or far from, what offen&s;ive Smells they
met with, or what condition the People &s;eemed to be
in, but looking upon them&s;elves all as &s;o many dead
Corp&s;es, they came to the Churches without the lea&s;t
Caution, and crowded together, as if their Lives
were of no Con&s;equence, compar'd to the Work
which they came about there: Indeed, the Zeal
which they &s;hew'd in Coming, and the Earne&s;tne&s;s
and Affection they &s;hew'd in their Attention to what
they heard, made it manife&s;t what a Value People
would all put upon the Wor&s;hip of God, if they
thought every Day they attended at the Church
that it would be their La&s;t.</P>
<P>Nor was it without other &s;trange Effects, for it
took away all Manner of Prejudice at, or Scruple a|bout
the Per&s;on who they found in the Pulpit when
they came to the Churches. It cannot be doubted,
but that many of the Mini&s;ters of the Pari&s;h-Chur|ches
were cut off among others in &s;o common and
&s;o dreadful a Calamity; and others had not Courage
enough to &s;tand it, but removed into the Country
as they found Means for E&s;cape, as then &s;ome Pa|ri&s;h-Churches
were quite vacant and for&s;aken, the
People made no Scruple of de&s;iring &s;uch Di&s;&s;enters
as had been a few Years before depriv'd of their Li|vings,
by Virtue of the Act of Parliament call'd,
<HI>The Act of &V;niformity</HI> to preach in the Churches, nor
did the Church Mini&s;ters in that Ca&s;e make any
Difficulty of accepting their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;o that ma|ny
of tho&s;e who they called &s;ilenced Mini&s;ters, had
their Mouths open'd on this Occa&s;ion, and preach'd
publickly to the People.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="204">
Here we may ob&s;erve, and I hope it will not be
ami&s;s to take notice of it, that a near View of Death
would &s;oon reconcile Men of good Principles
one to another, and that it is chiefly owing to our
ea&s;y Scituation in Life, and our putting the&s;e Things
far from us, that our Breaches are fomented, ill
Blood continued, Prejudices, Breach of Charity and
of Chri&s;tian Union &s;o much kept and &s;o far car|ry'd
on among us, as it is: Another Plague Year
would reconcile all the&s;e Differences, a clo&s;e con|ver&s;ing
with Death, or with Di&s;ea&s;es that threaten
Death, would &s;cum off the Gall from our Tem|pers,
remove the Animo&s;ities among us, and
bring us to &s;ee with differing Eyes, than tho&s;e
which we look'd on Things with before; as
the People who had been u&s;ed to join with the
Church, were reconcil'd at this Time, with the
admitting the Di&s;&s;enters to preach to them:
So the Di&s;&s;enters, who with an uncommon Preju|dice,
had broken off from the Communion of the
Church of England, were now content to come to
their Pari&s;h-Churches, and to conform to the Wor|&s;hip
which they did not approve of before; but as
the Terror of the Infection abated, tho&s;e Things
all returned again to their le&s;s de&s;irable Channel,
and to the Cour&s;e they were in before.</P>
<P>I mention this but hi&s;torically, I have no mind
to enter into Arguments to move either, or both
Sides to a more charitable Compliance one with a|nother;
I do not &s;ee that it is probable &s;uch a Di&s;|cour&s;e
would be either &s;uitable or &s;ucce&s;sful; the
Breaches &s;eem rather to widen, and tend to a wi|dening
farther, than to clo&s;ing, and who am I that
I &s;hould think my&s;elf able to influence either one
Side or other? But this I may repeat again, that
'tis evident Death will reconcile us all; on the o|ther
Side the Grave we &s;hall be all Brethren again:
In Heaven, whether, I hope we may come from all
<PB N="203" REF="205">
Parties and Per&s;wa&s;ions, we &s;hall find neither Pre|judice
or Scruple; there we &s;hall be of one Principle
and of one Opinion, why we cannot be content to
go Hand in Hand to the Place where we &s;hall join
Heart and Hand without the leaft He&s;itation, and
with the mo&s;t compleat Harmony and Affection; I
&s;ay, why we cannot do &s;o here I can &s;ay nothing to,
neither &s;hall I &s;ay any thing more of it, but that it
remains to be lamented.</P>
<P>I could dwell a great while upon the Calamities
of this dreadful time, and go on to de&s;cribe the
Objects that appear'd among us every Day, the
dreadful Extravagancies which the Di&s;traction of
&s;ick People drove them into; how the Streets be|gan
now to be fuller of frightful Objects, and Fa|milies
to be made even a Terror to them&s;elves:
But after I have told you, as I have above, that
One Man being tyed in his Bed, and finding no
other Way to deliver him&s;elf, &s;et the Bed on fire
with his Candle, which unhappily &s;tood within his
reach, and Burnt him&s;elf in his Bed. And how
another, by the in&s;ufferable Torment he bore,
daunced and &s;ung naked in the Streets, not know|ing
one Exta&s;ie from another, I &s;ay, after I have
mention'd the&s;e Things, What can be added more?
What can be &s;aid to repre&s;ent the Mi&s;ery of the&s;e
Times, more lively to the Reader, or to give him
a more perfect Idea of a complicated Di&s;tre&s;s?</P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge that this time was Terri|ble,
that I was &s;ometimes at the End of all my Re|&s;olutions,
and that I had not the Courage that I had
at the Beginning. As the Extremity brought other
People abroad, it drove me Home, and except,
having made my Voyage down to <HI>Blackwall</HI> and
<HI>Greenwich,</HI> as I have related, which was an Excur|&s;ion,
I kept afterwards very much within Doors,
as I had for about a Fortnight before; I have &s;aid
already, that I repented &s;everal times that I had
<PB N="204" REF="206">
ventur'd to &s;tay in Town, and had not gone away
with my Brother, and his Family, but it was too
late for that now; and after I had retreated and &s;tay'd
within Doors a good while, before my Impatience
led me Abroad, than they call'd me, as I have &s;aid,
to an ugly and dangerous Office, which brought
me out again; but as that was expir'd, while the
hight of the Di&s;temper la&s;ted, I retir'd again, and con|tinued
clo&s;e ten or twelve Days more. During
which many di&s;mal Spectacles repre&s;ented them|&s;elves
in my View, out of my own Windows, and
in our own Street, as that perticularly from <HI>Har|row-Alley,</HI>
of the poor outrageous Creature which
danced and &s;ung in his Agony, and many others
there were: Scar&s;e a Day or Night pa&s;s'd over, but
&s;ome di&s;mal Thing or other happened at the End
of that <HI>Harrow-Alley,</HI> which was a Place full of poor
People, mo&s;t of them belonging to the Butchers, or
to Employments depending upon the Butchery.</P>
<P>Sometimes Heaps and Throngs of People would
bur&s;t out of that Alley, mo&s;t of them Women,
making a dreadful Clamour, mixt or Compound|ed
of Skreetches, Ctyings and Calling one another,
that we could not conceive what to make of it;
almo&s;t all the dead Part of the Night the dead
Cart &s;tood at the End of that Alley, for if it went
in it could not well turn again, and could go in
but a little Way. There, I &s;ay, it &s;tood to receive
dead Bodys, and as the Church-Yard was but a
little Way off, if it went away full it would &s;oon
be back again: It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the mo&s;t
horrible Cries and Noi&s;e the poor People would
make at their bringing the dead Bodies of their
Children and Friends out to the Cart, and by the
Number one would have thought, there had bee$
none left behind, or that there were People enoug$
for a &s;mall City liveing in tho&s;e Places: Severa$
times they cryed Murther, &s;ometimes Fire; bu$
<PB N="205" REF="207">
it was e&s;ie to perceive it was all Di&s;traction, and
the Complaints of Di&s;tre&s;s'd and di&s;temper'd Peo|ple.</P>
<P>I believe it was every where thus at that time, for
the Plague rag'd for &s;ix or &s;even Weeks beyond all
that I have expre&s;s'd; and came even to &s;uch a
height, that in the Extremity, they began to break
into that excellent Order, of which I have &s;poken
&s;o much, in behalf of the Magi&s;trates, namely,
that no dead Bodies were &s;een in the Streets or
Burials in the Day-time, for there was a Nece&s;&s;ity,
in this Extremety, to bear with its being otherwi&s;e,
for a little while.</P>
<P>One thing I cannot omit here, and indeed I
thought it was extraordinary, at lea&s;t, it &s;eemed a
remarkable Hand of Divine Ju&s;tice, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That
all the Predictors, A&s;trologers, Fortune-tellers,
and what they call'd cunning-Men, Conjurers, and
the like; calculators of Nativities, and dreamers
of Dreams, and &s;uch People, were gone and va|ni&s;h'd,
not one of them was to be found: I am,
verily, per&s;waded that a great Number of them fell
in the heat of the Calamity, having ventured to
&s;tay upon the Pro&s;pect of getting great E&s;tates;
and indeed their Gain was but too great for a time
through the Madne&s;s and Folly of the People; but
now they were &s;ilent, many of them went to their
long Home, not able to &s;oretel their own Fate, or
to calculate their own Nativities; &s;ome have been
critical enough to &s;ay, that every one of them dy'd;
I dare not affirm that, but this I mu&s;t own, that
I never heard of one of them that ever appear'd
after the Calamity was over.</P>
<P>But to return to my particular Ob&s;ervations,
during this dreadful part of the Vi&s;itation; I am
now come, as I have &s;aid, to the Month of <HI>Sep|tember,</HI>
which was the mo&s;t dreadful of its kind, I
believe, that ever <HI>London</HI> &s;aw; for by all the Ac|counts
<PB N="206" REF="208">
which I have &s;een of the preceding Vi&s;ita|tions
which have been in <HI>London,</HI> nothing has been
like it; the Number in the Weekly Bill amount|ing
to almo&s;t 40,000 from the 22d of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> to
the 26th of <HI>September,</HI> being but five Weeks, the

<P>This was a prodigious Number of it&s;elf, but if
I &s;hould add the Rea&s;ons which I have to believe
that this Account was deficient, and how deficient
it was, you would with me, make no Scruple to be|lieve
that there died above ten Thou&s;and a Week for
all tho&s;e Weeks, one Week with another, and a
proportion for &s;everal Weeks both before and af|ter:
The Confu&s;ion among the People, e&s;pecially
within the City at that time, was inexpre&s;&s;ible; the
Terror was &s;o great at la&s;t, that the Courage of the
People appointed to carry away the Dead, began
to fail them; nay, &s;everal of them died altho' they
had the Di&s;temper before, and were recover'd;
and &s;ome of them drop'd down when they have
been carrying the Bodies even at the Pit&s;ide, and
ju&s;t ready to throw them in; and this Confu&s;ion
was greater in the City, becau&s;e they had flat|ter'd
them&s;elves with Hopes of e&s;caping: And
thought the bitterne&s;s of Death was pa&s;t: One
Cart they told us, going up <HI>Shoreditch,</HI> was for|&s;aken
of the Drivers, or being left to one Man to
drive, he died in the Street, and the Hor&s;es going
on, overthrew the Cart, and left the Bodies, &s;ome
thrown out here, &s;ome there, in a di&s;mal manner;
Another Cart was it &s;eems found in the great
<PB N="207" REF="209">
Pit in <HI>Finsbury</HI> Fields, the Driver being Dead, or
having been gone and abandon'd it, and the Hor&s;es
running too near it, the Cart fell in and drew the
Hor&s;es in al&s;o: It was &s;ugge&s;ted that the Driver
was thrown in with it, and that the Cart fell up|on
him, by Rea&s;on his Whip was &s;een to be in
the Pit among the Bodies; but that, I &s;uppo&s;e,
cou'd not be certain.</P>
<P>In our Pari&s;h of <HI>Aldgate,</HI> the dead-Carts
were &s;everal times, as I have heard, found &s;tand|ing
at the Church-yard Gate, full of dead Bodies,
but neither Bell man or Driver, or any one el&s;e
with it; neither in the&s;e, or many other Ca&s;es, did
they know what Bodies they had in their Cart, for
&s;ometimes they were let down with Ropes out of
Balconies and out of Windows; and &s;ometimes
the Bearers brought them to the Cart, &s;ometimes
other People; nor, <HI>as the Men them&s;elves &s;aid,</HI> did
they trouble them &s;elves to keep any Account of
the Numbers.</P>
<P>The Vigilance of the Magi&s;trate was now put
to the utmo&s;t Trial, and it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, can
never be enough acknowledg'd on this Occa&s;ion
al&s;o, whatever Expence or Trouble they were at,
two Things were never neglected in the City or
Suburbs either.</P>
<P>1. Provi&s;ions were always to be had in full Plenty,
and the Price not much rais'd neither, hardly
worth &s;peaking.</P>
<P>2. No dead Bodies lay unburied or uncovered;
and if one walk'd from one end of the City to ano|ther,
no Funeral or &s;ign of it was to be &s;een in the
Day-time, except a little, as I have &s;aid above, in
the three fir&s;t Weeks in <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>This la&s;t Article perhaps will hardly be believ'd,
when &s;ome Accounts which others have publi&s;hed
&s;ince that &s;hall be &s;een, wherein they &s;ay, that the
Dead lay unburied, which I am a&s;&s;ured was utterly
<PB N="208" REF="210">
fal&s;e; at lea&s;t, if it had been any where &s;o, it mu&s;t
ha' been in Hou&s;es where the Living were gone
from the Dead, having found means, as I have ob|&s;erved,
to E&s;cape, and where no Notice was gi|ven
to the Officers: All which amounts to nothing
at all in the Ca&s;e in Hand; for this I am po&s;itive
in, having my&s;elf been employ'd a little in the Di|rection
of that part in the Pari&s;h in which I liv'd,
and where as great a De&s;olation was made
in proportion to the Number of Inhabitants as
was any where. I &s;ay, I am &s;ure that there were
no dead Bodies remain'd unburied; that is to &s;ay,
none that the proper Officers knew of; none for
want of People to carry them off, and Buriers to
put them into the Ground and cover them; and
this is &s;ufficient to the Argument; for what might
lie in Hou&s;es and Holes as in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> Al$y is
nothing; for it is mo&s;t certain, they were buried as
&s;oon as they were found. As to the fir&s;t Article,
namely, of Provi&s;ions, the &s;carcity or dearne&s;s, tho' I
have mention'd it before, and &s;hall &s;peak of it a|gain;
yet I mu&s;t ob&s;erve here,</P>
<P>(1.) The Price of Bread in particular was not
much rai&s;ed; for in the beginning of the Year (<HI>viz.</HI>)
In the fir&s;t Week in <HI>March,</HI> the Penny Wheaten
Loaf was ten Ounces and a half; and in the height
of the Contagion, it was to be had at nine Oun|ces
and an half, and never dearer, no not all that
Sea&s;on: And about the beginning of <HI>November</HI> it
was &s;old ten Ounces and a half again; the like of
which, I believe, was never heard of in any City,
under &s;o dreadful a Vi&s;itation before.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="211">
(2.) Neither was there (which I wondred much at)
any want of Bakers or Ovens kept open to &s;upply
the People with Bread; but this was indeed alledg'd
by &s;ome Families, <HI>viz.</HI> That their Maid-Servants go|ing
to the Bake-hou&s;es with their Dough to be
baked, which was then the Cu&s;tom, &s;ometimes came
Home with the Sickne&s;s, that is to &s;ay, the Plague
upon them.</P>
<P>In all this dreadful Vi&s;itation, there were, as I
have &s;aid before, but two Pe&s;t-hou&s;es made u&s;e of,
<HI>viz.</HI> One in the Fields beyond <HI>Old-Street,</HI> and one in
<HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> neither was there any Compul&s;ion us'd
in carrying People thither: Indeed there was no
need of Compul&s;ion in the Ca&s;e, for there were
Thou&s;ands of poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed People, who having no
Help, or Conveniences, or Supplies but of Cha|rity,
would have been very glad to have been carryed
thither, and been taken Care of, which indeed was
the only thing that, I think, was wanting in the whole
publick Management of the City; &s;eeing no Body
was here allow'd to be brought to the Pe&s;t-hou&s;e,
but where Money was given, or Security for Money,
either at their introducing, or upon their being
cur'd and &s;ent out; for very many were &s;ent out again
whole, and very good Phy&s;icians were appointed to
tho&s;e Places, &s;o that many People did very well there,
of which I &s;hall make Mention again. The prin|cipal
Sort of People &s;ent thither were, as I have &s;aid,
Servants, who got the Di&s;temper by going of Er|rands
to fetch Nece&s;&s;aries to the Families where they
liv'd; and who in that Ca&s;e, if they came Home
&s;ick, were remov'd to pre&s;erve the re&s;t of the Hou&s;e;
and they were &s;o well look'd after there in all the
time of the Vi&s;itation, that there was but 156 bur|ried
in all at the <HI>London</HI> Pe&s;t-hou&s;e, and 159 at
that of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>By having more Pe&s;t-hou&s;es, I am far from mean|ing
a forcing all People into &s;uch Places. Had the
<PB N="210" REF="212">
&s;hutting up of Hou&s;es been omitted, and the Sick
hurried out of their Dwellings to Pe&s;t-hou&s;es, as
&s;ome propo&s;ed it &s;eems, at that time as well as &s;ince,
it would certainly have been much wor&s;e than it was;
the very removing the Sick, would have been a &s;pread|ing
of the Infection, and the rather becau&s;e that re|moving
could not effectually clear the Hou&s;e, where
the &s;ick Per&s;on was, of the Di&s;temper, and the re&s;t
of the Family being then left at Liberty would cer|tainly
&s;pread it among others.</P>
<P>The Methods al&s;o in private Families, which would
have been univer&s;ally u&s;ed to have concealed the
Di&s;temper, and to have conceal'd the Per&s;ons being
&s;ick, would have been &s;uch, that the Di&s;temper
would &s;ometimes have &s;eiz'd a whole Family before
any Vi&s;itors or Examiners could have known of it:
On the other hand, the prodigious Numbers which
would have been &s;ick at a time, would have exceeded all
the Capacity of publick Pe&s;t-hou&s;es to receive them,
or of publick Officers to di&s;cover and remove them.</P>
<P>This was well con&s;idered in tho&s;e Days, and I
have heard them talk of it often: The Magi&s;trates
had enough to do to bring People to &s;ubmit to hav|ing
their Hou&s;es &s;hut up, and many Ways they de|ceived
the Watchmen, and got out, as I have ob|&s;erved:
But that Difficulty made it apparent, that
they would have found it impracticable to have gone
the other way to Work; for they could never have
forced the &s;ick People out of their Beds and out of
their Dwellings; it mu&s;t not have been my Lord
Mayor's Officers, but an Army of Officers that mu&s;t
have attempted it; and the People, on the other hand,
would have been enrag'd and de&s;perate, and would
have kill'd tho&s;e that &s;hould have offered to have
meddled with them or with their Children and Re|lations,
whatever had befallen them for it; &s;o that
they would have made the People, who, <HI>as it was,</HI>
were in the mo&s;t terrible Di&s;traction imaginable; I
<PB N="211" REF="213">
&s;ay, they would have made them &s;tark mad; where|as
the Magi&s;trates found it proper on &s;everal Ac|counts
to treat them with Lenity and Compa&s;&s;ion,
and not with Violence and Terror, &s;uch as dragging
the Sick out of their Hou&s;es, or obliging them to
remove them&s;elves would have been.</P>
<P>This leads me again to mention the Time, when
the Plague fir&s;t began, that is to &s;ay, when it be|came
certain that it would &s;pread over the whole
Town, when, as I have &s;aid, the better &s;ort of
People fir&s;t took the Alarm, and began to hurry
them&s;elves out of Town: It was true, as I ob&s;erv'd
in its Place, that the Throng was &s;o great, and the
Coaches, Hor&s;es, Waggons and Carts were &s;o many,
driving and dragging the People away, that it look'd
as if all the City was running away; and had any
Regulations been publi&s;h'd that had been terrifying
at that time, e&s;pecially &s;uch as would pretend to
di&s;po&s;e of the People, otherwi&s;e than they would
di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves, it would have put both the
City and Suburbs into the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But the Magi&s;trates wi&s;ely caus'd the People to be
encourag'd, made very good By-Laws for the regu|lating
the Citizens, keeping good Order in the Streets,
and making every thing as eligible as po&s;&s;ible to
all Sorts of People.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place, the Lord Mayor and the She|riffs,
the Court of Aldermen, and a certain Number
of the Common Council-Men, or their Deputies
came to a Re&s;olution and publi&s;hed it, <HI>viz.</HI> &startq;That <HI>they</HI>
would not quit the City them&s;elves, but that they
would be always at hand for the pre&s;erving good
Order in every Place, and for the doing Ju&s;tice on
all Occa&s;ions; as al&s;o for the di&s;tributing the
publick Charity to the Poor; and in a Word, for
the doing the Duty, and di&s;charging the Tru&s;t
repos'd in them by the Citizens to the utmo&s;t of
their Power.&endq;</P>

In Pur&s;uance of the&s;e Orders, the Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> held Councils every Day more or
le&s;s, for making &s;uch Di&s;po&s;itions as they found
needful for pre&s;erving the Civil Peace; and tho' they
u&s;ed the People with all po&s;&s;ible Gentlene&s;s and Cle|mency,
yet all manner of pre&s;umptuous Rogues, &s;uch
as Thieves, Hou&s;e-breakers, Plunderers of the Dead,
or of the Sick, were duly puni&s;h'd, and &s;everal De|clarations
were continually publi&s;h'd by the Lord
Mayor and Court of Aldermen again&s;t &s;uch.</P>
<P>Al&s;o all Con&s;tables and Church-wardens were en|join'd
to &s;tay in the City upon &s;evere Penalties, or
to depute &s;uch able and &s;ufficient Hou&s;e-keepers, as
the Deputy Aldermen, or Common Council-men of
the Precinct &s;hould approve, and for whom they
&s;hould give Security; and al&s;o Security in ca&s;e of
Mortality, that they would forthwith con&s;titute
other Con&s;tables in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>The&s;e things re-e&s;tabli&s;h'd the Minds of the People
very much, e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t of their Fright,
when they talk'd of making &s;o univer&s;al a Flight,
that the City would have been in Danger of being
entirely de&s;erted of its Inhabitants, except the Poor;
and the Country of being plunder'd and laid wa&s;te
by the Multitude. Nor were the Magi&s;trates de|ficient
in performing their Part as boldly as they pro|mi&s;ed
it; for my Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs were
continually in the Streets, and at places of the greate&s;t
Danger; and tho' they did not care for having too
great a Re&s;ort of People crouding about them, yet,
in emergent Ca&s;es, they never denyed the People Ac|ce&s;s
to them, and heard with Patience all their
Grievances and Complaints; my Lord Mayor had
a low Gallery built on purpo&s;e in his Hall, where
he &s;tood a little remov'd from the Croud when any
Complaint came to be heard, that he might appear
with as much Safety as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="215">
Likewi&s;e the proper Officers, call'd <HI>my Lord
Mayor's Officers,</HI> con&s;tantly attended in their Turns,
as they were <HI>in waiting;</HI> and if any of them were
&s;ick or infected, as &s;ome of them were, others were
in&s;tantly employed to fill up and officiate in their
Places, till it was known whether the other &s;hould
live or die.</P>
<P>In like manner the Sheriffs and Aldermen did in
their &s;everal Stations and Wards, where they were
placed by Office; and the Sheriff's Officers or Ser|geants
were appointed to receive Orders from the
re&s;pective Aldermen in their Turn; &s;o that Ju&s;tice
was executed in all Ca&s;es without Interruption. In
the next Place, it was one of their particular Cares,
to &s;ee the Orders for the Freedom of the Markets
ob&s;erv'd; and in this part either the Lord Mayor, or
one or both of the Sheriffs, were every Market-day
on Hor&s;eback to &s;ee their Orders exeouted, and to
&s;ee that the Country People had all po&s;&s;ible En|couragement
and Freedom in their coming to the
Markets, and going back again; and that no Nu|&s;ances
or frightful Objects &s;hould be &s;een in the
Streets to terrify them, or make them unwilling to
come. Al&s;o the Bakers were taken under particular
Order, and the Ma&s;ter of the Bakers Company
was, with his Court of A&s;&s;i&s;tance, directed to &s;ee
the Order of my Lord Mayor for their Regulation put
in Execution, and the due A&s;&s;ize of Bread, which
was weekly appointed by my Lord Mayor, ob&s;erv'd,
and all the Bakers were oblig'd to keep their Ovens
going con&s;tantly, on pain of lo&s;ing the Privileges of
a Freeman of the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>By this means, Bread was always to be had in
Plenty, and as cheap as u&s;ual, as I &s;aid above; and
Provi&s;ions were never wanting in the Markets, even
to &s;uch a Degree, that I often wonder'd at it, and
reproach'd my &s;elf with being &s;o timorous and cau|tious
<PB N="214" REF="216">
in &s;tirring abroad, when the Country People
came freely and boldly to Market, as if there had
been no manner of Infection in the City, or Dan|ger
of catching it.</P>
<P>It was indeed one admirable piece of Conduct in the
&s;aid Magi&s;trates, that the Streets were kept con&s;tant|ly
clear, and free from all manner of frightful Ob|jects,
dead Bodies, or any &s;uch things as were inde|cent
or unplea&s;ant, unle&s;s where any Body fell down
&s;uddenly or died in the Streets, <HI>as I have &s;aid above,</HI>
and the&s;e were generally covered with &s;ome Cloth
or Blanket, or remov'd into the next Church-yard,
till Night: All the needful Works, that carried
Terror with them, that were both di&s;mal and dan|gerous,
were done in the Night; if any di&s;eas'd
Bodies were remov'd, or dead Bodies buried, or in|fected
Cloths burnt, it was done in the Night; and
all the Bodies, which were thrown into the great
Pits in the &s;everal Church-yards, or burying Grounds,
<HI>as has been ob&s;erv'd,</HI> were &s;o remov'd in the Night;
and every thing was covered and clo&s;ed before Day:
So that in the Day-time there was not the lea&s;t Sig|nal
of the Calamity to be &s;een or heard of, except
what was to be ob&s;erv'd from the Emptine&s;s of the
Streets, and &s;ometimes from the pa&s;&s;ionate Out|cries
and Lamentations of the People, out at their
Windows, and from the Numbers of Hou&s;es and
Shops &s;hut up.</P>
<P>Nor was the Silence and Emptine&s;s of the Streets
&s;o much in the City as in the Out-parts, except ju&s;t
at one particular time, when, as I have mention'd, the
Plague came Ea&s;t, and &s;pread over all the City: It
was indeed a merciful Di&s;po&s;ition of God, that as the
Plague began at one End of the Town fir&s;t, <HI>as has been
ob&s;erv'd at large,</HI> &s;o it proceeded progre&s;&s;ively to other
Parts, and did not come on this way or Ea&s;t|ward,
till it had &s;pent its Fury in the We&s;t part of
<PB N="215" REF="217">
the Town; and &s;o as it came on one way, it abat|ed
another. <HI>For Example.</HI></P>
<P>It began at St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s and the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> End
of the Town, and it was in its Height in all that
part by about the Middle of <HI>July, viz.</HI> in St. <HI>Giles</HI>
in the <HI>Fields,</HI> St. <HI>Andrew's Holborn,</HI> St. <HI>Clement-Danes,</HI>
St. <HI>Martins</HI> in the <HI>Fields,</HI> and in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter:</HI> The
latter End of <HI>July</HI> it decrea&s;ed in tho&s;e Pari&s;hes, and
coming Ea&s;t, it encrea&s;ed prodigiou&s;ly in <HI>Cripple|gate,</HI>
St. <HI>Sepukhers,</HI> St. <HI>Ja. Clarkenwell,</HI> and St. <HI>Brides,</HI>
and <HI>Alder&s;gate;</HI> while it was in all the&s;e Pari&s;hes, the
City and all the Pari&s;hes of the <HI>Southwark</HI> Side of
the Water, and all <HI>Stepney, White-Chapel, Aldgate,
Wapping,</HI> and <HI>Ratcliff</HI> were very little touch'd; &s;o
that People went about their Bu&s;ine&s;s unconcern'd,
carryed on their Trades, kept open their Shops,
and conver&s;ed freely with one another in all the
City, the Ea&s;t and North-Ea&s;t Suburbs, and in <HI>South|wark,</HI>
almo&s;t as if the Plague had not been among us.</P>
<P>Even when the North and North-we&s;t Suburbs
were fully infected, <HI>viz. Cripplegate, Clarkenwell,

by 48 than in all the City, and all the Ea&s;t Suburbs,

cau&s;ed the Reputation of the City's Health to con|tinue
all over <HI>England,</HI> and e&s;pecially in the Coun|ties

would &s;ee the out Streets empty, and the Hou&s;es and

walk in the Middle of the Streets; but when they
came within the City, <HI>there things look'd better,</HI> and
the Markets and Shops were open, and the People
walking about the Streets as u&s;ual, tho' not quite
&s;o many; and this continued till the latter End of

this in a frightful manner.</P>

<P>And now the Mi&s;ery of the City, and of the &s;aid
Ea&s;t and South Parts was complete indeed; for as
you &s;ee the Weight of the Di&s;temper lay upon
tho&s;e Parts, that is to &s;ay, the City, the eight Pa|ri&s;hes
over the River, with the Pari&s;hes of <HI>Aldgate,
White-Chapel,</HI> and <HI>Stepney,</HI> and this was the Time
that the Bills came up to &s;uch a mon&s;trous Height,
as that I mention'd before; and that Eight or Nine,
and, as I believe, Ten or Twelve Thou&s;and a Week
died; for 'tis my &s;ettled Opinion, that they never
could come at any ju&s;t Account of the Numbers,
for the Rea&s;ons which I have given already.</P>
<P>Nay one of the mo&s;t eminent Phy&s;icians, who
has &s;ince publi&s;h'd in Latin an Account of tho&s;e
Times, and of his Ob&s;ervations, &s;ays, that in one
Week there died twelve Thou&s;and People, and that
particularly there died four Thou&s;and in one Night;
tho' I do not remember that there ever was any
&s;uch particular Night, &s;o remarkably fatal, as that
&s;uch a Number died in it: However all this con|firms
what I have &s;aid above of the Uncertainty of
the Bills of Mortality, &amp;c. of which I &s;hall &s;ay
more hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="221">
And here let me take leave to enter again, tho'
it may &s;eem a Repetition of Circum&s;tances, into a De|&s;cription
of the mi&s;erable Condition of the City it
&s;elf, and of tho&s;e Parts where I liv'd at this parti|cular
Time: The City, and tho&s;e other Parts, notwith|&s;tanding
the great Numbers of People that were gone
into the Country, was va&s;tly full of People, and per|haps
the fuller, becau&s;e People had for a long time
a &s;trong Belief, that the Plague would not come in|to
the City, nor into <HI>Southwark,</HI> no nor into <HI>Wap|ping,</HI>
or <HI>Ratcliff</HI> at all; nay &s;uch was the A&s;&s;urance
of the People on that Head, that many remov'd
from the Suburbs on the We&s;t and North Sides, in|to
tho&s;e Ea&s;tern and South Sides as for Safety, and
as I verily believe, carry'd, the Plague among&s;t
them there, perhaps &s;ooner than they would other|wi&s;e
have had it.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o I ought to leave a farther Remark for
the u&s;e of Po&s;terity, concerning the Manner of
Peoples infecting one another; namely, that it was
not the &s;ick People only, from whom the Plague was
immediately receiv'd by others that were &s;ound, but
THE WELL. <HI>To explain my &s;elf;</HI> by <HI>the &s;ick</HI> Peo|ple
I mean tho&s;e who were known to be &s;ick, had
taken their Beds, had been under Cure, or had
Swellings and Tumours upon them, and the like;
the&s;e every Body could beware of, they were either
in their Beds, or in &s;uch Condition as cou'd not be
conceal'd.</P>
<P>By <HI>the Well,</HI> I mean &s;uch as had received the Con|tagion,
and had it really upon them, and in their
Blood, yet did not &s;hew the Con&s;equences of it in
their Countenances, nay even were not &s;en&s;ible of
it them&s;elves, <HI>as many were not</HI> for &s;everal Days:
The&s;e breathed Death in every Place, and upon every
Body who came near them; nay their very Cloaths
retained the Infection, their Hands would infect the
Things they touch'd, e&s;pecially if they were warm
<PB N="220" REF="222">
and &s;weaty, and they were generally apt to &s;weat
too.</P>
<P>Now it was impo&s;&s;ible to know the&s;e People,
nor did they &s;ometimes, as I have &s;aid, know them|&s;elves
to be infected: The&s;e were the People that
&s;o often dropt down and fainted in the Streets; for
oftentimes they would go about the Streets to the
la&s;t, till on a &s;udden they would &s;weat, grow faint,
&s;it down at a Door and die: It is true, finding
them&s;elves thus, they would &s;truggle hard to get
Home to their own Doors, or at other Times would
be ju&s;t able to go in to their Hou&s;es and die in&s;tant|ly;
other Times they would go about till they had the
very Tokens come out upon them, and yet not know
it, and would die in an Hour or two after they came
Home, but be well as long as they were Abroad:
The&s;e were the dangerous People, the&s;e were the
People of whom the well People ought to have
been afraid; but then <HI>on the other &s;ide</HI> it was impo&s;&s;ible
to know them.</P>
<P>And this is the Rea&s;on why it is impo&s;&s;ible in a
Vi&s;itation to prevent the &s;preading of the Plague
by the utmo&s;t human Vigilance, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that it is im|po&s;&s;ible
to know the infected People from the &s;ound;
or that the infected People &s;hould perfectly know
them&s;elves: I knew a Man who conver&s;ed freely in
<HI>London</HI> all the Sea&s;on of the Plague in 1665, and
kept about him an Antidote or Cordial, on pur|po&s;e
to take when he thought him&s;elf in any Dan|ger,
and he had &s;uch a Rule to know, or have
warning of the Danger by, as indeed I never met
with before or &s;ince, how far it may be depended
on I know not: He had a Wound in his Leg, and
whenever he came among any People that were not
&s;ound, and the Infection began to affect him, he
&s;aid he could know it by that Signal, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That his
Wound in his Leg would &s;mart, and look pale
and white; &s;o as &s;oon as ever he felt it &s;mart, it
<PB N="221" REF="223">
was time for him to withdraw, or to take care of
him&s;elf, taking his Drink, which he always carried
about him for that Purpo&s;e. Now it &s;eems he found
his Wound would &s;mart many Times when he was in
Company with &s;uch, who thought them&s;elves to be
&s;ound, and who appear'd &s;o to one another; but he
would pre&s;ently ri&s;e up, and &s;ay publickly, Friends, here
is &s;ome Body in the room that has the Plague, and
&s;o would immediately break up the Company. This
was indeed a faithful Monitor to all People, that the
Plague is not to be avoided by tho&s;e that conver&s;e pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly
in a Town infected, and People have
it when they know it not, and that they likewi&s;e give
it to others when they know not that they have it
them&s;elves; and in this Ca&s;e, &s;hutting up the WELL
or removing the SICK will not do it, unle&s;s they
can go back and &s;hut up all tho&s;e that the Sick had
Convers'd with, even before they knew them&s;elves
to be &s;ick, and none knows how far to carry that
back, or where to &s;top; for none knows when, or
where, or how they may have received the Infec|tion,
or from whom.</P>
<P>This I take to be the Rea&s;on, which makes &s;o many
People talk of the Air being corrupted and infected,
and that they need not be cautious of whom they
conver&s;e with, for that the Contagion was in the
Air. I have &s;een them in &s;trange Agitations and Sur|pri&s;es
on this Account, I have never come near any
infected Body! <HI>&s;ays the di&s;turbed Per&s;on,</HI> I have Con|vers'd
with none, but &s;ound healthy People, and yet
I have gotten the Di&s;temper! I am &s;ure I am
&s;truck from Heaven, <HI>&s;ays another,</HI> and he falls to the
&s;erious Part; again the fir&s;t goes on exclaiming, I
have come near no Infection, or any infected Per|&s;on,
<HI>I am &s;ure it is in the Air;</HI> We draw in Death
when we breath, and therefore 'tis the Hand of
God, there is no with&s;tanding it; and this at la&s;t
made many People, being hardened to the Danger,
<PB N="222" REF="224">
grow le&s;s concern'd at it, and le&s;s cautious towards
the latter End of the Time, and when it was
come to its height, than they were at fir&s;t;
then with a kind of a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Prede&s;tinariani&s;m, they
would &s;ay, if it pleas'd God to &s;trike them, it was
all one whether they went Abroad or &s;taid at Home,
they cou'd not e&s;cape it, and therefore they went
boldly about even into infected Hou&s;es, and infected
Company; vi&s;ited &s;ick People, and in &s;hort, lay in
the Beds with their Wives or Relations when they
were infected; and what was the Con&s;equence? But
the &s;ame that is the Con&s;equence in <HI>Turkey,</HI> and in
tho&s;e Countries where they do tho&s;e Things; name|ly,
that they were infected too, and died by Hun|dreds
and Thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>I would be far from le&s;&s;ening the Awe of the Judg|ments
of God, and the Reverence to his Providence,
which ought always to be on our Minds on &s;uch Oc|ca&s;ions
as the&s;e; doubtle&s;s the Vi&s;itation it &s;elf is
a Stroke from Heaven upon a City, or Country, or
Nation where it falls; a Me&s;&s;enger of his Venge|ance,
and a loud Call to that Nation, or Country,
or City, to Humiliation and Repentance, according
to that of the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> xviii. 7, 8. <HI>At what
in&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a Nation, and concern|ing
a Kingdom to pluck up, and to pull down, and de|&s;troy
it: If that Nation again&s;t whom I have pro|nounced,
turn from their evil, I will repent of the
evil that I thought to do unto them.</HI> Now to prompt due
Impre&s;&s;ions of the Awe of God on the Minds of Men
on &s;uch Occa&s;ions, and not to le&s;&s;en them it is that I
have left tho&s;e Minutes upon Record.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, therefore I reflect upon no Man for put|ing
the Rea&s;on of tho&s;e Things upon the immedi|ate
Hand of God, and the Appointment and Direc|tion
of his Providence; nay, on the contrary, there
were many wonderful Deliverances of Per&s;ons from
Infection, and Deliverances of Per&s;ons when In|fected,
<PB N="223" REF="225">
which intimate &s;ingular and remarkable Pro|vidence,
in the particular In&s;tances to which they
refer, and I e&s;teem my own Deliverance to be one
next to miraculous, and do record it with Thank|fulne&s;s.</P>
<P>But when I am &s;peaking of the Plague, as a Di|&s;temper
ari&s;ing from natural Cau&s;es, we mu&s;t con|&s;ider
it as it was really propagated by natural Means,
nor is it all the le&s;s a Judgment for its being un|der
the Conduct of humane Cau&s;es and Effects; for
as the divine Power has form'd the whole Scheme of
Nature, and maintains Nature in its Cour&s;e; &s;o the
&s;ame Power thinks fit to let his own Actings with
Men, whether of Mercy or Judgement, go on in
the ordinary Cour&s;e of natural Cau&s;es, and he is
plea&s;ed to act by tho&s;e natural Cau&s;es as the ordina|ry
Means; excepting and re&s;erving to him&s;elf never|thele&s;s
a Power to act in a &s;upernatural Way when
he &s;ees occa&s;ion: Now 'tis evident, that in the Ca&s;e
of an Infection, there is no apparent extraordinary
occa&s;ion for &s;upernatural Operation, but the ordi|nary
Cour&s;e of Things appears &s;ufficiently arm'd,
and made capable of all the Effects that Heaven
u&s;ually directs by a Contagion. Among the&s;e Cau|&s;es
and Effects this of the &s;ecret Conveyance of In|fection
imperceptible, and unavoidable, is more
than &s;ufficient to execute the Fiercene&s;s of divine
Vengeance, without putting it upon Supernaturals
and Miracle.</P>
<P>The acute penetrating Nature of the Di&s;ea&s;e it
&s;elf was &s;uch, and the Infection was receiv'd &s;o im|perceptibly,
that the mo&s;t exact Caution could not
&s;ecure us while in the Place: But I mu&s;t be allowed
to believe, and I have &s;o many Examples fre&s;h in
my Memory, to convince me of it, that I think
none can re&s;i&s;t their Evidence; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> I mu&s;t be al|lowed
to believe, that no one in this whole Nation
ever receiv'd the Sickne&s;s or Infection, but who re|ceiv'd
<PB N="224" REF="226">
it in the ordinary Way of Infection from
&s;ome Body, or the Cloaths, or touch, or &s;tench of
&s;ome Body that was infected before.</P>
<P>The Manner of its coming fir&s;t to <HI>London,</HI>
proves this al&s;o, (<HI>viz.</HI>) by Goods brought over from
<HI>Holland,</HI> and brought thither from the <HI>Levant;</HI>
the fir&s;t breaking of it out in a Hou&s;e in <HI>Long-Acre,</HI>
where tho&s;e Goods were carried, and fir&s;t opened;
its &s;preading from that Hou&s;e to other Hou&s;es, by
the vi&s;ible unwary conver&s;ing with tho&s;e who were
&s;ick, and the infecting the Pari&s;h Officers who were
employed about the Per&s;ons dead, <HI>and the like;</HI> the&s;e
are known Authorities for this great Foundation
Point, that it went on, and proceeded from Per&s;on
to Per&s;on, and from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, and no other|wi&s;e:
In the fir&s;t Hou&s;e that was infected there
died four Per&s;ons, a Neighbour hearing the Mi&s;tre&s;s
of the fir&s;t Hou&s;e was &s;ick, went to vi&s;it her, and went
Home and gave the Di&s;temper to her Family, and
died, and all her Hou&s;hold. A Mini&s;ter call'd to
pray with the fir&s;t &s;ick Per&s;on in the &s;econd Hou&s;e,
was &s;aid to &s;icken immediately, and die with &s;eve|ral
more in his Hou&s;e: Then the Phy&s;icians began
to con&s;ider, for they did not at fir&s;t dream of a ge|neral
Contagion. But the Phy&s;icians being &s;ent
to in&s;pect the Bodies, they a&s;&s;ur'd the People
that it was neither more or le&s;s than <HI>the Plague</HI> with
all its terrifying Particulars, and that it threatned an
univer&s;al Infection, &s;o many People having already
convers'd with the Sick or Di&s;temper'd, and hav|ing,
as might be &s;uppos'd, received Infection from
them, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to put a &s;top to
it.</P>
<P>Here the Opinion of the Phy&s;icians agreed with
my Ob&s;ervation afterwards, namely, that the Dan|ger
was &s;preading in&s;en&s;ibly; for the Sick cou'd
infect none but tho&s;e that came within reach of
the &s;ick Per&s;on; but that one Man, who may have
<PB N="225" REF="227">
really receiv'd the Infection, and knows it not, but
goes Abroad, and about as a &s;ound Per&s;on, may
give the Plague to a thou&s;and People, and they to
greater Numbers in Proportion, and neither the Per|&s;on
giving the Infection, or the Per&s;ons receiving it,
know any thing of it, and perhaps not feel the Ef|fects
of it for &s;everal Days after.</P>
<P><HI>For Example,</HI> Many Per&s;ons in the Time of this
Vi&s;itation never perceiv'd that they were infected, till
they found to their un&s;peakable Surprize, the Tokens
come out upon them, after which they &s;eldom liv'd
&s;ix Hours; for tho&s;e Spots they call'd the Tokens
were really gangreen Spots, or mortified Fle&s;h in
&s;mall Knobs as broad as a little &s;ilver Peny, and hard
as a piece of Callous or Horn; &s;o that when the
Di&s;ea&s;e was come up to that length, there was no|thing
could follow but certain Death, and yet <HI>as I
&s;aid</HI> they knew nothing of their being Infec|ted,
nor found them&s;elves &s;o much as out of Order,
till tho&s;e mortal Marks were upon them: But every
Body mu&s;t allow, that they were infected in a high
Degree before, and mu&s;t have been &s;o &s;ome time;
and con&s;equently their Breath, their Sweat, their
very Cloaths were contagious for many Days be|fore.</P>
<P>This occa&s;ion'd a va&s;t Variety of Ca&s;es, which
Phy&s;icians would have much more opportunity to
remember than I; but &s;ome came within the Com|pa&s;s
of my Ob&s;ervation, or hearing, of which I
&s;hall name a few.</P>
<P>A certain Citizen who had liv'd &s;afe, and un|touch'd,
till the Month of <HI>September,</HI> when the
Weight of the Di&s;temper lay more in the City
than it had done before, was mightly chearful, and
&s;omething too bold, as I think it was, in his Talk
of how &s;ecure he was, how cautious he had been,
and how he had never come near any &s;ick Body:
Says another Citizen, a Neighbour of his to him,
<PB N="226" REF="228">
one Day, <HI>Do not be too confident</HI> Mr.&mdash;<HI>it is hard to
&s;ay who is &s;ick and who is well; for we &s;ee Men alive,
and well to outward Appearance one Hour, and dead
the next. That is true,</HI> &s;ays the fir&s;t Man, for he
was not a Man pre&s;umptuou&s;ly &s;ecure, but had e&s;|cap'd
a long while, and Men, as I &s;aid above, e&s;pe|cially
in the City, began to be over-ea&s;ie upon that
Score. <HI>That is true,</HI> &s;ays he, I do not think my
&s;elf &s;ecure, <HI>but I hope I have not been in Company
with any Per&s;on that there has been any Danger in.</HI>
No! Says his Neighbour, <HI>was not you at the</HI> Bull|head
<HI>Tavern in</HI> Gracechurch Street <HI>with</HI> Mr.&mdash;
<HI>the Night before la&s;t:</HI> YES, &s;ays the fir&s;t, <HI>I was,</HI>
but <HI>there was no Body there, that we had any Rea&s;on
to think dangerous:</HI> Upon which his Neigbour &s;aid
no more, being unwilling to &s;urprize him; but this
made him more inqui&s;itive, and as his Neighbour
appear'd backward, he was the more impatient,
and in a kind of Warmth, &s;ays he aloud, <HI>why he is
not dead, is he!</HI> upon which his Neighbour &s;till
was &s;ilent, but ca&s;t up his Eyes, and &s;aid &s;omething
to him&s;elf; at which the fir&s;t Citizen turned pale,
and &s;aid no more but this, <HI>then I am a dead Man
too,</HI> and went Home immediately, and &s;ent for a
neighbouring Apothecary to give him &s;omething
preventive, for he had not yet found him&s;elf ill;
but the Apothecary opening his Brea&s;t, fetch'd a
Sigh, and &s;aid no more, but this, <HI>look up to God;</HI> and
the Man died in a few Hours.</P>
<P>Now let any Man judge from a Ca&s;e like this,
if it is po&s;&s;ible for the Regulations of Magi&s;trates,
either by &s;huting up the Sick, or removing them, to
&s;top an Infection, which &s;preads it &s;elf from Man to
Man, even while they are perfectly well, and in|&s;en&s;ible
of its Approach, and may be &s;o for many
Days.</P>
<P>It may be proper to a&s;k here, how long it may
be &s;uppo&s;ed, Men might have the Seeds of the Con|tagion
<PB N="227" REF="229">
in them, before it di&s;cover'd it &s;elf in this fa|tal
Manner; and how long they might go about
&s;eemingly whole, and yet be contagious to all tho&s;e
that came near them? I believe the mo&s;t experienc'd
Phy&s;icians cannot an&s;wer this Que&s;tion directly, any
more than I can; and &s;omething an ordinary Ob|&s;erver
may take notice of, which may pa&s;s their Ob|&s;ervation.
The opinion of Phy&s;ician Abroad &s;eems
to be, that it may lye Dormant in the Spirits, or
in the Blood Ve&s;&s;els, a very con&s;iderable Time;
why el&s;e do they exact a Quarentine of tho&s;e who
come into their Harbours, and Ports, from &s;u&s;pec|ted
Place? Forty Days is, one would think, too
long for Nature to &s;truggle with &s;uch an Enemy as
this, and not conquer it, or yield to it: But I could
not think by my own Ob&s;ervation that they can be
infected &s;o, as to be contagious to other, above
fifteen or &s;ixteen Days at farthe&s;t; and on that
&s;core it was, that when a Hou&s;e was &s;hut up in the
City, and any one had died of the Plague, but no
Body appear'd to be ill in the Family for &s;ixteen or
eighteen Days after, they were not &s;o &s;trict, but
that they would connive at their going privately
Abroad; nor would People be much afraid of them
afterward, but rather think they were fortified the
better, having not been vulnerable when the Ene|my
was in their own Hou&s;e; but we &s;ometimes
found it had lyen much longer conceal'd.</P>
<P>Upon the foot of all the&s;e Ob&s;ervations, I mu&s;t &s;ay,
that tho' Providence &s;eem'd to direct my Conduct
to be otherwi&s;e; yet it is my opinion, and I mu&s;t
leave it as a Pre&s;cription, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>that the be&s;t Phy&s;ick
again&s;t the Plague is to run away from it.</HI> I know
People encourage them&s;elves, by &s;aying, God is
able to keep us in the mid&s;t of Danger, and able
to overtake us when we think our &s;elves out of
Danger; and this kept Thou&s;and in the Town,
who&s;e Carca&s;&s;es went into the great Pits by Cart
<PB N="228" REF="230">
Loads; and who, if they had fled from the Danger,
had, I believe, been &s;afe from the Di&s;a&s;ter; at lea&s;t 'tis
probable they had been &s;afe.</P>
<P>And were this very Fundamental only duly con|&s;ider'd
by the People, on any future occa&s;ion of
this, or the like Nature, I am per&s;uaded it would
put them upon quite different Mea&s;ures for manag|ing
the People, from tho&s;e that they took in 1665,
or than any that have been taken Abroad that I have
heard of; in a Word, they would con&s;ider of
&s;eperating the People into &s;maller Bodies, and re|moving
them in Time farther from one another,
and not let &s;uch a Contagion as this, which is indeed
chiefly dangerous, to collected Bodies of People, find
a Million of People in a Body together, as was
very near the Ca&s;e before, and would certainly be
the Ca&s;e, if it &s;hould ever appear again.</P>
<P>The Plague like a great Fire, if a few Hou&s;es
only are contiguous where it happens, can only burn
a few Hou&s;es; or if it begins in a &s;ingle, or as we
call it a loan Hou&s;e, can only burn that loan Hou&s;e
where it begins: But if it begins in a clo&s;e built
Town, or City, and gets a Head, there its Fury
encrea&s;es, it rages over the whole Place, and con|&s;umes
all it can reach.</P>
<P>I could propo&s;e many Schemes, on the foot of
which, the Government of this City, if ever they
&s;hould be under the Apprehen&s;ions of &s;uch another
Enemy, (God forbid they &s;hould) might ea&s;e them|&s;elves
of the greate&s;t Part of the dangerous People
that belong to them; I mean &s;uch as the begging,
&s;tarving, labouring Poor, and among them chiefly
tho&s;e who in Ca&s;e of a Siege, are call'd the u&s;ele&s;s
Mouths; who being then prudently, and to their
own Advantage di&s;pos'd of, and the wealthy Inha|bitants
di&s;po&s;ing of them&s;elves, and of their Ser|vants,
and Children, the City, and its adjacen$
Parts would be &s;o effectually evacuated, that ther$
<PB N="229" REF="231">
would not be above a tenth Part of its People left
together, for the Di&s;ea&s;e to take hold upon: But
&s;uppo&s;e them to be a fifth Part, and that two Hun|dred
and fifty Thou&s;and People were left, and if it
did &s;eize upon them, they would by their living &s;o
much at large, be much better prepar'd to defend
them&s;elves again&s;t the Infection, and be le&s;s liable
to the Effects of it, than if the &s;ame Number of
People lived clo&s;e together in one &s;maller City,
&s;uch as <HI>Dublin,</HI> or <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> or the like.</P>
<P>It is true, Hundreds, yea Thou&s;ands of Fami|lies
fled away at this la&s;t Plague, but then of them,
many fled too late, and not only died in their
Flight, but carried the Di&s;temper with them into
the Countries where they went, and infected tho&s;e
whom they went among for Safety; which confound|ed
the Thing, and made that be a Propagation of
the Di&s;temper, which was the be&s;t means to pre|vent
it; and this too is an Evidence of it, and brings
me back to what I only hinted at before, but mu&s;t
&s;peak more fully to here; namely, that Men went
about apparently well, many Days after they had
the taint of the Di&s;ea&s;e in their Vitals, and after
their Spirits were &s;o &s;eiz'd, as that they could never
e&s;cape it; and that all the while they did &s;o, they
were dangerous to others. <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> this proves, <HI>that
&s;o it was;</HI> for &s;uch People infected the very Towns
they went thro', as well as the Families they went
among, and it was by that means, that almo&s;t all
the great Towns in <HI>England</HI> had the Di&s;temper
among them, more or le&s;s; and always they would
tell you &s;uch a <HI>Londoner</HI> or &s;uch a <HI>Londoner</HI> brought
it down.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be omitted, that when I &s;peak of
tho&s;e People who were really thus dangerous, I &s;up|po&s;e
them to be utterly ignorant of their own Con|dition;
for if they really knew their Circum&s;tances to be
&s;uch as indeed they were, they mu&s;t have been a kind of
<PB N="230" REF="232">
<HI>willful Murtherers,</HI> if they would have gone Abroad
among healthy People, and it would have verified
indeed the Sugge&s;tion <HI>which I mention'd above, and
which I thought &s;eem'd untrue,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI>) That the infected
People were utterly carele&s;s as to giving the Infec|tion
to others, and rather forward to do it than not;
and I believe it was partly from this very Thing
that they rai&s;ed that Sugge&s;tion, which I hope
was not really true in Fact.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s no particular Ca&s;e is &s;ufficient to prove
a general, but I cou'd name &s;everal People within
the Knowledge of &s;ome of their Neighbours and
Families yet living, who &s;hew'd the contrary to an
extream. One Man, a Ma&s;ter of a Family in my
Neighbourhood, having had the Di&s;temper, he
thought he had it given him by a poor Workman
whom he employ'd, and whom he went to his Hou&s;e
to &s;ee, or went for &s;ome Work that he wanted to
have fini&s;hed, and he had &s;ome Apprehen&s;ions even
while he was at the poor Workman's Door, but
did not di&s;cover it fully, but the next Day it di&s;|covered
it &s;elf, and he was taken very ill; upon
which he immediately cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be
carried into an out Building which he had in
his Yard, and where there was a Chamber over
a Work-hou&s;e, the Man being a Brazier; here
he lay, and here he died, and would be tended
by none of his Neighbours, but by a Nur&s;e from
Abroad, and would not &s;uffer his Wife, or Chil|dren,
or Servants, to come up into the Room le&s;t
they &s;hould be infected, but &s;ent them his Ble&s;&s;ing
and Prayers for them by the Nur&s;e, who &s;poke it
to them at a Di&s;tance, and all this for fear of giv|ing
them the Di&s;temper, and without which, he
knew as they were kept up, they could not have
it.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t ob&s;erve al&s;o, that the Plague, as
I &s;uppo&s;e all Di&s;tempers do, operated in a different
<PB N="231" REF="233">
Manner, on differing Con&s;titutions; &s;ome were im|mediately
overwhelm'd with it, and it came to vio|lent
Fevers, Vomitings, un&s;ufferable Head-achs,
Pains in the Back, and &s;o up to Ravings and Rag|ings
with tho&s;e Pains: Others with Swellings and
Tumours in the Neck or Groyn, or Arm-pits,
which till they could be broke, put them into in|&s;ufferable
Agonies and Torment; while others, as I
have ob&s;erv'd, were &s;ilently infected, the Fever
preying upon their Spirits in&s;en&s;ibly, and they &s;ee|ing
little of it, till they fell into &s;wooning, and
faintings, and Death without pain.</P>
<P>I am not Phy&s;ician enough to enter into the par|ticular
Rea&s;ons and Manner of the&s;e differing Effects
of one and the &s;ame Di&s;temper, and of its differ|ing
Operation in &s;everal Bodies; nor is it my Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
here to record the Ob&s;ervations, which I really
made, becau&s;e the Doctors them&s;elves, have done
that part much more effectually than I can do, and
becau&s;e my opinion may in &s;ome things differ from
theirs: I am only relating what I know, or have
heard, or believe of the particular Ca&s;es, and what fell
within the Compa&s;s of my View, and the different
Nature of the Infection, as it appeared in the parti|cular
Ca&s;es which I have related; but this may be
added too, that tho' the former Sort of tho&s;e Ca|&s;es,
namely tho&s;e openly vi&s;ited, were the wor&s;t
for them&s;elves as to Pain, I mean tho&s;e that had
&s;uch Fevers, Vomitings, Head-achs, Pains and
Swellings, becau&s;e they died in &s;uch a dreadful Man|ner,
yet the latter had the wor&s;t State of the Di&s;|ea&s;e;
for in the former they frequently recover'd,
e&s;pecially if the Swellings broke, but the latter
was inevitable Death; no cure, no help cou'd be
po&s;&s;ible, nothing could follow but Death; and it
was wor&s;e al&s;o to others, becau&s;e as, above, it &s;ecret|ly,
and unperceiv'd by others, or by them&s;elves,
communicated Death to tho&s;e they convers'd witb,
<PB N="232" REF="234">
the penetrating Poi&s;on in&s;inuating it &s;elf into their
Blood in a Manner, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to de|&s;cribe,
or indeed conceive.</P>
<P>This infecting and being infected, without &s;o
much as its being known to either Per&s;on, is evi|dent
from two Sorts of Ca&s;es, which frequently
happened at that Time; and there is hardly any
Body living who was in <HI>London</HI> during the Infec|tion,
but mu&s;t have known &s;everal of the Ca&s;es of
both Sorts.</P>
<P>1. Fathers and Mothers have gone about as
if they had been well, and have believ'd them|&s;elves
to be &s;o, till they have in&s;en&s;ibly infected,
and been the De&s;truction of their whole Families:
Which they would have been far from doing,
if they had the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;ions of their be|ing
un&s;ound and dangerous them&s;elves. A Family,
who&s;e Story I have heard, was thus infected by the
Father, and the Di&s;temper began to appear upon
&s;ome of them, even before he found it upon him|&s;elf;
but &s;earching more narrowly, it appear'd he
had been infected &s;ome Time, and as &s;oon as he
found that his Family had been poi&s;on'd by him&s;elf,
he went di&s;tracted, and would have laid violent
Hands upon him&s;elf, but was kept from that by
tho&s;e who look'd to him, and in a few Days
died.</P>
<P>2. The other Particular is, that many People hav|ing
been well to the be&s;t of their own Judgment, or by
the be&s;t Ob&s;ervation which they could make of
them&s;elves for &s;everal Days, and only finding a De|cay
of Appetite, or a light Sickne&s;s upon their Sto|mach;
nay, &s;ome who&s;e Appetite has been &s;trong,
and even craving, and only a light Pain in their
Heads; have &s;ent for Phy&s;icians to know what
ail'd them, and have been found to their great Sur|prize,
at the brink of Death, the Tokens upon
them, or the Plague grown up to an incurable Height.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="235">
It was very &s;ad to reflect, how &s;uch a Per&s;on <HI>as
this la&s;t mentioned above,</HI> had been a walking De&s;troy|er,
perhaps for a Week or Fortnight before that;
how he had ruin'd tho&s;e, that he would have hazar|ded
his Life to &s;ave, and had been breathing Death up|on
them, even perhaps in his tender Ki&s;&s;ing and
Embracings of his own Children: Yet thus certain|ly
it was, and often has been, and I cou'd give
many particular Ca&s;es where it has been &s;o; if then
the Blow is thus in&s;en&s;ibly &s;tricken; if the Arrow
flies thus un&s;een, and cannot be di&s;covered; to what
purpo&s;e are all the Schemes for &s;hutting up or re|moving
the &s;ick People? tho&s;e Schemes cannot take
place, but upon tho&s;e that appear to be &s;ick, or to
be infected; whereas there are among them, at the
&s;ame time, Thou&s;ands of People, who &s;eem to be
well, but are all that while carrying Death with
them into all Companies which they come into.</P>
<P>This frequently puzzled our Phy&s;icians, and e&s;pe|cially
the Apothecaries and Surgeons, who knew
not how to di&s;cover the Sick from the Sound; they
all allow'd <HI>that it was really &s;o,</HI> that many People
had the Plague in their very Blood, and preying up|on
their Spirits, and were in them&s;elves but walking
putrified Carca&s;&s;es, who&s;e Breath was infectious,
and their Sweat Poi&s;on; and yet were as well to
look on as other People, and even knew it not them|&s;elves:
I &s;ay, they all allowed that it was really true
in Fact, but they knew not how to propo&s;e a Di&s;|covery.</P>
<P>My Friend Doctor <HI>Heath</HI> was of Opinion, that
it might be known by the &s;mell of their Breath;
but then, <HI>as he &s;aid,</HI> who dur&s;t Smell to that Breath
for his Information? Since to know it, he mu&s;t
draw the Stench of the Plague up into his own
Brain, in order to di&s;tingui&s;h the Smell! I have
heard, it was the opinion of others, that it might be
di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Party's breathing upon a piece of
<PB N="234" REF="236">
Gla&s;s, where the Breath conden&s;ing, there might
living Creatures be &s;een by a Micro&s;cope of &s;trange
mon&s;trous and frightful Shapes, &s;uch as Dragons,
Snakes, Serpents, and Devils, horrible to behold:
But this I very much que&s;tion the Truth of, and
we had no Micro&s;copes at that Time, as I remem|ber,
to make the Experiment with.</P>
<P>It was the opinion al&s;o of another learned Man,
that the Breath of &s;uch a Per&s;on would poi&s;on, and
in&s;tantly kill a Bird; not only a &s;mall Bird, but even
a Cock or Hen, and that if it did not immediately
kill the latter, it would cau&s;e them to be roupy <HI>as
they call it;</HI> particularly that if they had laid any
Eggs at that Time, they would be all rotten: But
tho&s;e are Opinions which I never found &s;upported
by any Experiments, or heard of others that had
&s;een it; &s;o I leave them as I find them, only with
this Remark; namely, that I think the Probabili|ties
are very &s;trong for them.</P>
<P>Some have propo&s;ed that &s;uch Per&s;ons &s;hould
breath hard upon warm Water, and that they would
leave an unu&s;ual Scum upon it, or upon &s;everal
other things, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are of a glutinous
Sub&s;tance and are apt to receive a Scum and &s;upport it.</P>
<P>But from the whole I found, that the Nature of this
Contagion was &s;uch, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover
it at all, or to prevent its &s;preading from one to ano|ther
by any human Skill.</P>
<P>Here was indeed one Difficulty, which I could ne|ver
throughly get over to this time, and which there
is but one way of an&s;wering that I know of, and it is
this, <HI>viz.</HI> The fir&s;t Per&s;on that died of the Plague
was in <HI>Decemb.</HI> 20^t^h, or thereabouts 1664, and in,
or about <HI>Long-acre,</HI> whence the fir&s;t Per&s;on had the
Infection, was generally &s;aid to be, from a Parcel of Silks
imported from <HI>Holland,</HI> and fir&s;t opened in that Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But after this we heard no more of any Per&s;on dying
of the Plague, or of the Di&s;temper being in that
<PB N="235" REF="237">
Place, till the 9^t^h of <HI>February;</HI> which was about 7
Weeks after, and then one more was buried out of
the &s;ame Hou&s;e: Then it was hu&s;h'd, and we were
perfectly ea&s;y as to the publick, for a great while;
for there were no more entred in the Weekly Bill
to be dead of the Plague, till the 22^d of <HI>April,</HI> when
there was 2 more buried not out of the &s;ame Hou&s;e,
but out of the &s;ame Street; and as near as I can re|member,
it was out of the next Hou&s;e to the fir&s;t:
this was nine Weeks a&s;under, and after this we had
No more till a Fortnight, and then it broke out in
&s;everal Streets and &s;pread every way. Now the
Que&s;tion &s;eems to lye thus, <HI>where lay the Seeds of
the Infection all this while? How came it to &s;top &s;o
long, and not &s;top any longer?</HI> Either the Di|&s;temper
did not come immediately by Contagion
from Body to Body, or if it did, then a Body may
be capable to continue infected, without the Di&s;ea&s;e
di&s;covering it&s;elf, many Days, nay Weeks together,
even not a Quarentine of Days only, but Soixan|tine,
not only 40 Days but 60 Days or longer.</P>
<P>It's true, there was, as I ob&s;erved at fir&s;t, and is well
known to many yet living, a very cold Winter, and a
long Fro&s;t, which continued three Months, and this,
the Doctors &s;ay, might check the Infection; but then
the learned mu&s;t allow me to &s;ay, that if according
to their Notion, the Di&s;ea&s;e was, as I may &s;ay, on|ly
frozen up, it would like a frozen River, have
returned to its u&s;ual Force and Current when it
thaw'd, whereas the principal Rece&s;s of this Infection,
which was from <HI>February</HI> to <HI>April,</HI> was after the
Fro&s;t was broken, and the Weather mild and warm.</P>
<P>But there is another way of &s;olving all this Diffi|culty,
which I think my own Remembrance of the
thing will &s;upply; and that is, the Fact is not granted,
namely, that there died none in tho&s;e long Inter|vals,
<HI>viz.</HI> from the 20^t^h of <HI>December</HI> to the 9^t^h of
<HI>February,</HI> and from thence to the 22^d of <HI>April.</HI>
<PB N="236" REF="238">
The Weekly Bills are the only Evidence on the other
&s;ide, and tho&s;e Bills were not of Credit enough, at
lea&s;t with me, to &s;upport an <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> or determine
a Que&s;tion of &s;uch Importance as this: For it was
our receiv'd Opinion at that time, and I believe upon
very good Grounds, that the Fraud lay in the Pari&s;h
Officers, Searchers, and Per&s;ons appointed to give
Account of the Dead, and what Di&s;ea&s;es they died
of: And as People were very loth at fir&s;t to have
the Neighbours believe their Hou&s;es were infected,
&s;o they gave Money to procure, or otherwi&s;e pro|cur'd
the dead Per&s;ons to be return'd as dying of
other Di&s;tempers; and this I know was practis'd
afterwards in many Places, I believe I might &s;ay in
all Places, where the Di&s;temper came, as will be
&s;een by the va&s;t Encrea&s;e of the Numbers plac'd in
the Weekly Bills under other Articles of Di&s;ea&s;es,
during the time of the Infection: <HI>For Example,</HI> in
the Month of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> when the Plague was
coming on to its highe&s;t Pitch; it was very ordinary
to have from a thou&s;and to twelve hundred, nay to
almo&s;t fifteen Hundred a Week of other Di&s;tem|pers;
not that the Numbers of tho&s;e Di&s;tempers
were really encrea&s;ed to &s;uch a Degree: But the
great Number of Families and Hou&s;es where really
the Infection was, obtain'd the Favour to have their
dead be return'd of other Di&s;tempers to prevent the
&s;hutting up their Hou&s;es. <HI>For Example,</HI>

<P>There were &s;everal other Articles which bare a
Proportion to the&s;e, and which it is ea&s;y to perceive,
were increa&s;ed on the &s;ame Account, as <HI>Aged, Con|&s;umptions,
Vomitings, Impo&s;thumes, Gripes,</HI> and the
like, many of which were not doubted to be infec|ted
People; but as it was of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence
to Families not to be known to be infected, if it was
po&s;&s;ible to avoid it, &s;o they took all the mea&s;ures
they could to have it not believ'd; and if any died
in their Hou&s;es to get them return'd to the Exami|ners,
<PB N="238" REF="240">
and by the Searchers, as having died of other
Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, will account for the long Interval,
which, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> was between the dying of the
fir&s;t Per&s;ons that were returend in the Bill to be
dead of the Plague, and the time when the Di&s;tem|per
&s;pread openly, and could not be conceal'd.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the Weekly Bills them&s;elves at that time
evidently di&s;cover this Truth; for while there was
no Mention of the Plague, and no Increa&s;e, after it
had been mentioned, yet it was apparent, that there
was an Encrea&s;e of tho&s;e Di&s;tempers which bor|dered
neare&s;t upon it, for Example there were Eight,
Twelve, Seventeen of the Spotted Fever in a Week,
when there were none, or but very few of the Plague;
whereas before <HI>One, Three,</HI> or <HI>Four,</HI> were the ordi|nary
Weekly Numbers of that Di&s;temper; likewi&s;e,
as I ob&s;erved before, the Burials increa&s;ed Weekly
in that particular Pari&s;h, and the Pari&s;hes adjacent,
more than in any other Pari&s;h, altho' there were none
&s;et down of the Plague; all which tells us, that the
Infection was handed on, and the Succe&s;&s;ion of the
Di&s;temper really pre&s;erv'd, tho' it &s;eem'd to us at
that time to be cea&s;ed, and to come again in a man|ner
&s;urpri&s;ing.</P>
<P>It might be al&s;o, that the Infection might remain
in other parts of the &s;ame Parcel of Goods which at
fir&s;t it came in, and which might not be perhaps
opened, or at lea&s;t not fully, or in the Cloths of the
fir&s;t infected Per&s;on; for I cannot think, that any
Body could be &s;eiz'd with the Contagion in a fatal
and mortal Degree for nine Weeks together, and
&s;upport his State of Health &s;o well, as even not to
di&s;cover it to them&s;elves; yet if it were &s;o, the Ar|gument
is the &s;tronger in Favour of what I am &s;ay|ing;
namely, that the Infection is retain'd in Bodies
apparently well, and convey'd from them to tho&s;e they
<PB N="239" REF="241">
conver&s;e with, while it is known to neither the one
nor the other.</P>
<P>Great were the Confu&s;ions at that time upon this
very Account; and when People began to be con|vinc'd
that the Infection was receiv'd in this &s;ur|pri&s;ing
manner from Per&s;ons apparently well, they
began to be exceeding &s;hie and jealous of every one
that came near them. Once in a publick Day, whe|ther
a Sabbath Day or not I do not remember, in
<HI>Aldgate</HI> Church in a Pew full of People, on a &s;ud|en,
one fancy'd &s;he &s;melt an ill Smell, immediately
&s;he fancies the Plague was in the Pew, whi&s;pers her
Notion or Su&s;picion to the next, then ri&s;es and
goes out of the Pew, it immediately took with the
next, and &s;o to them all; and every one of them, and
of the two or three adjoining Pews, got up and
went out of the Church, no Body knowing what
it was offended them or from whom.</P>
<P>This immediately filled every Bodies Mouths with
one Preparation or other, &s;uch as the old Women
directed, and &s;ome perhaps as Phy&s;icians directed, in
order to prevent Infection by the Breath of others;
in&s;omuch that if we came to go into a Church,
when it was any thing full of People, there would
be &s;uch a Mixture of Smells at the Entrance, that it
was much more &s;trong, tho' perhaps not &s;o whole|&s;ome,
than if you were going into an Apothecary's
or Druggi&s;t's Shop; in a Word, the whole Church
was like a &s;melling Bottle, in one Corner it was all
Perfumes, in another Aromaticks, Bal&s;amicks, and
Variety of Drugs, and Herbs; in another Salts and
Spirits, as every one was furni&s;h'd for their own
Pre&s;ervation; yet I ob&s;erv'd, that after People were
po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> with the Belief or rather
A&s;&s;urance, of the Infection being thus carryed on by
Per&s;ons apparently in Health, the Churches and
Meeting-Hou&s;es were much thinner of People than
<PB N="240" REF="242">
at other times before that they us'd to be; for this
is to be &s;aid of the People of <HI>London,</HI> that during
the whole time of the Pe&s;tilence, the Churches or
Meetings were never wholly &s;hut up, nor did the
People decline coming out to the public Wor&s;hip
of God, except only in&s;ome Pari&s;hes when the Vio|lence
of the Di&s;temper was more particularly in that
Pari&s;h at that time; and even then no longer, than
it continued to be &s;o.</P>
<P>Indeed nothing was more &s;trange, than to &s;ee
with what Courage the People went to the public
Service of God, even at that time when they were
afraid to &s;tir out of their own Hou&s;es upon any other
Occa&s;ion; this I mcan before the time of De&s;pera|tion,
which I have mention'd already; this was a
Proof of the exceeding Populou&s;ne&s;s of the City at
the time of the Infection, notwith&s;tanding the great
Numbers that were gone into the Country at the
fir&s;t Alarm, and that fled out into the Fore&s;ts and
Woods when they were farther terrifyed with the
extraordinary Increa&s;e of it. For when we came to
&s;ee the Crouds and Throngs of People, which ap|pear'd
on the Sabbath Days at the Churches, and
e&s;pecially in tho&s;e parts of the Town where the
Plague was abated, or where it was not yet come
to its Height, it was amazing. But of this I &s;hall
&s;peak again pre&s;ently; I return in the mean time
to the Article of infecting one another at fir&s;t;
before People came to right Notions of the Infe|ction,
and of infecting one another, People were
only &s;hye of tho&s;e that were really &s;ick, a Man with
a Cap upon his Head, or with Cloths round his Neck,
<HI>which was the Ca&s;e of tho&s;e that had Swellings there;</HI>
&s;uch was indeed frightful: But when we &s;aw a Gentle|man
dre&s;s'd, with his Band on and his Gloves in his
Hand, his Hat upon his Head, and his Hair comb'd,
of &s;uch we had not the lea&s;t Apprehen&s;ions; and
<PB N="241" REF="243">
People conver&s;e a great while freely, <HI>e&s;pecially with
their Neighbours and &s;uch as they knew.</HI> But when
the Phy&s;icians a&s;&s;ured us, that the Danger was as
well from the Sound, that is <HI>the &s;eemingly &s;ound,</HI> as the
Sick; and that tho&s;e People, who thought them&s;elves
entirely free, were oftentimes the mo&s;t fatal; and that
it came to be generally under&s;tood, that People were
&s;en&s;ible of it, and of the rea&s;on of it: Then I &s;ay
they began to be jealous of every Body, and a va&s;t
Number of People lock'd them&s;elves up, &s;o as not
to come abroad into any Company at all, nor &s;uf|fer
any, that had been abroad in promi&s;cuous Com|pany,
to come into their Hou&s;es, or near them; at
lea&s;t not &s;o near them, as to be within the Reach of
their Breath, or of any Smell from them; and when
they were oblig'd to conver&s;e at a Di&s;tance with
Strangers, they would always have Pre&s;ervatives in
their Mouths, and about their Cloths to repell and
keep off the Infection.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, that when People began
to u&s;e the&s;e Cautions, they were le&s;s expo&s;ed to
Danger, and the Infection did not break into &s;uch
Hou&s;es &s;o furiou&s;ly as it did into others before,
and thou&s;ands of Families were pre&s;erved, <HI>&s;peaking
with due Re&s;erve to the Direction of Divine Provi|dence,</HI>
by that Means.</P>
<P>But it was impo&s;&s;ible to beat any thing into the
Heads of the Poor, they went on with the u&s;ual Im|petuo&s;ity
of their Tempers full of Outcries and
Lamentations when taken, but madly carele&s;s of
them&s;elves, Fool-hardy and ob&s;tinate, while they
were well: Where they could get Employment they
pu&s;h'd into any kind of Bu&s;ine&s;s, the mo&s;t dangerous
and the mo&s;t liable to Infection; and if they were
&s;poken to, their An&s;wer would be, <HI>I mu&s;t tru&s;t to
God for that; if I am taken, then I am provided for,
and there is an End of me,</HI> and the like: OR THUS,
<HI>Why, What mu&s;t I do? I can't &s;tarve, I had as
<PB N="242" REF="244">
good have the Plague as peri&s;h for want. I have no
Work, what could I do? I mu&s;t do this or beg:</HI> Sup|po&s;e
it was burying the dead, or attending the Sick,
or watching infected Hou&s;es, which were all ter|rible
Hazards, but their Tale was generally the &s;ame.
It is true Nece&s;&s;ity was a very ju&s;tifiable warran|table
Plea, and nothing could be better; but their
way of Talk was much the &s;ame, where the Nece&s;|&s;ities
were not the &s;ame: This adventurous Con|duct
of the Poor was that which brought the Plague
among them in a mo&s;t furious manner, and this
join'd to the Di&s;tre&s;s of their Circum&s;tances, when
taken, was the rea&s;on why they died &s;o by Heaps;
for I cannot &s;ay, I could ob&s;erve one jot of better
Hu&s;bandry among them, I mean the labouring Poor,
while they were well and getting Money, than
there was before, but as lavi&s;h, as extravagant, and
as thoughtle&s;s for to Morrow as ever; &s;o that when
they came to be taken &s;ick, they were immediate|ly
in the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s as well for want, as for
Sickne&s;s, as well for lack of Food, as lack of
Health.</P>
<P>This Mi&s;ery of the Poor I had many Occa&s;ions
to be an Eye-witne&s;s of, and &s;ometimes al&s;o of the
charitable A&s;&s;i&s;tance that &s;ome pious People daily
gave to &s;uch, &s;ending them Relief and Supplies
both of Food, Phy&s;ick and other Help, as they found
they wanted; and indeed it is a Debt of Ju&s;tice due
to the Temper of the People of that Day to take
Notice here, that not only great Sums, <HI>very great</HI>
Sums of Money were charitably &s;ent to the Lord
Mayor and Aldermen for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Sup|port
of the poor di&s;temper'd People; but abundance
of private People daily di&s;tributed large Sums of
Money for their Relief, and &s;ent People about to
enquire into the Condition of particular di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and
vi&s;ited Families, and relieved them; nay &s;ome pious
Ladies were &s;o tran&s;ported with Zeal in &s;o good a
<PB N="243" REF="245">
Work, and &s;o confident in the Protection of Pro|vidence
in Di&s;charge of the great Duty of Charity,
that they went about in per&s;on di&s;tributing Alms to
the Poor, and even vi&s;iting poor Families, tho' &s;ick
and infected in their very Hou&s;es, appointing Nur&s;es
to attend tho&s;e that wanted attending, and ordering
Apothecaries and Surgeons, the fir&s;t to &s;upply them
with Drugs or Plai$ters, and &s;uch things as they
wanted; and the la&s;t to lance and dre&s;s the Swel|lings
and Tumours, where &s;uch were wanting; giv|ing
their Ble&s;&s;ing to the Poor in &s;ub&s;tantial Relief
to them, as well as hearty Prayers for them.</P>
<P>I will not undertake to &s;ay, as &s;ome do, that none
of the&s;e charitable People were &s;uffered to fall under
the Calamity it&s;elf; but this I may &s;ay, that I ne|ver
knew any one of them that mi&s;carried, which
I mention for the Encouragement of others in ca&s;e
of the like Di&s;tre&s;s; and doubtle&s;s, <HI>if they that give
to the Poor, lend to the Lord, and he will repay them;</HI>
tho&s;e that hazard their Lives to give to the Poor,
and to comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Poor in &s;uch a Mi&s;ery
as this, may hope to be protected in the Work.</P>
<P>Nor was this Charity &s;o extraordinary eminent on|ly
in a few; but, (<HI>for I cannot lightly quit this Point</HI>)
the Charity of the rich as well in the City and Sub|urbs
as from the Country, was &s;o great, that in a
Word, a prodigious Number of People, who mu&s;t
otherwi&s;e inevitably have peri&s;hed for want as well
as Sickne&s;s, were &s;upported and &s;ub$i$ted by it; and
tho' I could never, nor I believe any one el&s;e come
to a full Knowledge of what was &s;o contributed,
yet I do believe, that as I heard one &s;ay, that was
a critical Ob&s;erver of that Part, there was not on|ly
many Thou&s;and Pounds contributed, but many
hundred thou&s;and Pounds, to the Relief of the Poor
of this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed afflicted City; nay one Man affirm'd to
me that he could reckon up above one hundred thou|&s;and
<PB N="244" REF="246">
Pounds a Week, which was di&s;tributed by the
Church Wardens at the &s;everal Pari&s;h Ve&s;tries,
by the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen in the &s;everal
Wards and Precincts, and by the particular Direction
of the Court and of the Ju&s;tices re&s;pectively in the parts
where they re&s;ided; over and above the private Cha|rity
di&s;tributed by pious Hands in the manner I &s;peak
of, and this continued for many Weeks together.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s this is a very great Sum; but if it be
true, that there was di&s;tributed in the Pari&s;h of
<HI>Cripplegate</HI> only 17800 Pounds in one Week to the
Relief of the Poor, as I heard reported, and which
I really believe was true, the other may not be im|probable.</P>
<P>It was doubtle&s;s to be reckon'd among the many
&s;ignal good Providences which attended this great
City, <HI>and of which there were many other worth re|cording;</HI>
I &s;ay, this was a very remarkable one,
that it plea&s;ed God thus to move the Hearts of the
People in all parts of the Kingdom, &s;o chearfully to
contribute to the Relief and Support of the poor
at <HI>London;</HI> the good Con&s;equences of which were
felt many ways, and particularly in pre&s;erving the
Lives and recovering the Health of &s;o many thou|&s;ands,
and keeping &s;o many Thou&s;ands of Families
from peri&s;hing and &s;tarving.</P>
<P>And now I am talking of the merciful Di&s;po&s;ition
of Providence in this time of Calamity, I cannot
but mention again, tho' I have &s;poken &s;everal times
of it already on other Account, I mean that of the
Progre&s;&s;ion of the Di&s;temper; how it began at one
end of the Town, and proceeded gradually and &s;low|ly
from one Part to another, and like a dark Cloud
that pa&s;&s;es over our Heads, which as it thickens and
overca&s;ts the Air at one End, clears up at the
other end: So while the Plague went on raging from
We&s;t to Ea&s;t, as it went forwards Ea&s;t, it abated
<PB N="245" REF="247">
in the We&s;t, by which means tho&s;e parts of the
Town, which were not &s;eiz'd, or who were left,
and where it had &s;pent its Fury, were (as it were)
&s;par'd to help and a&s;&s;i&s;t the other; whereas had the
Di&s;temper &s;pread it &s;elf over the whole City and
Suburbs at once, raging in all Places alike, as it has
done &s;ince in &s;ome Places abroad, the whole Body
of the People mu&s;t have been overwhelmed, and there
would have died twenty thou&s;and a Day, as they
&s;ay there did at <HI>Naples,</HI> nor would the People have
been able to have help'd or a&s;&s;i&s;ted one another.</P>
<P>For it mu&s;t be ob&s;erv'd that where the Plague was
in its full Force, there indeed the People were very
mi&s;erable, and the Con&s;ternation was inexpre&s;&s;ible.
But a little before it reach'd even to that place, or
pre&s;ently after it was gone, they were quite another
Sort of People, and I cannot but acknowledge, that
there was too much of that common Temper of
Mankind to be found among us all at that time;
namely to forget the Deliverance, when the Danger
is pa&s;t: But I &s;hall come to &s;peak of that part
again.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be forgot here to take &s;ome Notice
of the State of Trade, during the time of this com|mon
Calamity, and this with re&s;pect to Foreign
Trade, as al&s;o to our Home-trade.</P>
<P>As to Foreign Trade, there needs little to be
&s;aid; the trading Nations of Europe were all afraid
of us, no Port of <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Holland,</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> or
<HI>Italy</HI> would admit our Ships or corre&s;pond with us;
indeed we &s;tood on ill Terms with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and
were in a furious War with them, but tho' in
a bad Condition to fight abroad, who had &s;uch
dreadful Enemies to &s;truggle with at Home.</P>
<P>Our Merchants accordingly were at a full Stop,
their Ships could go no where, that is to &s;ay to no
place abroad; their Manufactures and Merchandi&s;e,
<PB N="246" REF="248">
that is to &s;ay, of our Growth, would not be touch'd
abroad; they were as much afraid of our Goods,
as they were of our People; and indeed they had
rea&s;on, for our woolen Manufactures are as reten|tive
of Infection as human Bodies, and if pack'd up
by Per&s;ons infected would receive the Infection, and
be as dangerous to touch, as a Man would be that
was infected; and therefore when any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el
arriv'd in Foreign Countries, if they did take the
Goods on Shore, they always cau&s;ed the Bales to
be opened and air'd in Places appointed for that
Purpo&s;e: But from <HI>London</HI> they would not &s;uffer
them to come into Port, much le&s;s to unlade their
Goods upon any Terms whatever; and this Strictne&s;s
was e&s;pecially us'd with them in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> in
<HI>Turkey</HI> and the I&s;lands of the <HI>Arches</HI> indeed as they are
call'd, as well tho&s;e belonging to the <HI>Turks</HI> as to the
<HI>Venetians,</HI> they were not &s;o very rigid; in the fir&s;t
there was no Ob&s;truction at all; and four Ships, which
were then in the River loading for <HI>Italy,</HI> that is
for <HI>Leghorn</HI> and <HI>Naples,</HI> being denyed Product, <HI>as they
call it,</HI> went on to <HI>Turkey,</HI> and were freely admitted
to unlade their Cargo without any Difficulty, only
that when they arriv'd there, &s;ome of their Cargo
was not fit for Sale in that Country, and other
Parts of it being con&s;ign'd to Merchants at <HI>Leghorn,</HI>
the Captains of the Ships had no Right nor any Or|ders
to di&s;po&s;e of the Goods; &s;o that great Incon|veniences
followed to the Merchants. But this was no|thing
but what the Nece&s;&s;ity of Affairs requir'd, and
the Merchants at <HI>Leghorn</HI> and at <HI>Naples</HI> having No|tice
given them, &s;ent again from thence to take
Care of the Effects, which were particularly con|&s;ign'd
to tho&s;e Ports, and to bring back in other
Ships &s;uch as were improper for the Markets at
<HI>Smyrna</HI> and <HI>Scanderoon.</HI></P>
<P>The Inconveniences in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal</HI> were
&s;till greater; for they would, by no means, &s;uffer
<PB N="247" REF="249">
our Ships, e&s;pecially tho&s;e from <HI>London,</HI> to come
into any of their Ports, much le&s;s to unlade; there
was a Report, that one of our Ships having by
Stealth delivered her Cargo, among which was &s;ome
Bales of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth, Cotton, Ker&s;yes, and &s;uch
like Goods, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> cau&s;ed all the Goods to
be burnt, and puni&s;hed the Men with Death who
were concern'd in carrying them on Shore. This I
believe was in Part true, tho' I do not affirm it: But it
is not at all unlikely, &s;eeing the Danger was real|ly
very great, the Infection being &s;o violent in <HI>Lon|don.</HI></P>
<P>I heard likewi&s;e that the Plague was carryed into
tho&s;e Countries by &s;ome of our Ships, and parti|cularly
to the Port of <HI>Faro</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Al|garve,</HI>
belonging to the King of <HI>Portugal;</HI> and that
&s;everal Per&s;ons died of it there, but it was not con|firm'd.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, tho' the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI>
were &s;o &s;hie of us, it is mo&s;t certain, that the
Plague, <HI>as has been &s;aid,</HI> keeping at fir&s;t much at
that end of the Town next <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> the mer|chandi&s;ing
part of the Town, &s;uch as the City and
the Water-&s;ide, was perfectly &s;ound, till at lea&s;t the
Beginning of <HI>July;</HI> and the Ships in the River till
the Beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> for to the 1^&s;^t of <HI>July,</HI>
there had died but &s;even within the whole City,
and but 60 within the Liberties; but one in all
the Pari&s;hes of <HI>Stepney, Aldgate,</HI> and <HI>White-Chap|pel;</HI>
and but two in all the eight Pari&s;hes of <HI>South|wark.</HI>
But it was the &s;ame thing abroad, for the
bad News was gone over the whole World, that
the City of <HI>London</HI> was infected with the Plague;
and there was no inquiring there, how the Infec|tion
proceeded, or at which part of the Town it
was begun, or was reach'd to.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, after it began to &s;pread, it increa&s;ed &s;o
fa&s;t, and the Bills grew &s;o high, all on a &s;udden,
<PB N="248" REF="250">
that it was to no purpo&s;e to le&s;&s;en the Report of it,
or endeavour to make the People abroad think it
better than it was, the Account which the Week|ly
Bills gave in was &s;ufficient; and that there died
two thou&s;and to three or four thou&s;and a Week, was
&s;ufficient to alarm the whole trading part of the
World, and the following time being &s;o dreadful
al&s;o in the very City it &s;elf, put the whole World,
<HI>I &s;ay,</HI> upon their Guard again&s;t it.</P>
<P>You may be &s;ure al&s;o, that the Report of the&s;e
things lo&s;t nothing in the Carriage, the Plague was
it &s;elf very terrible, and the Di&s;tre&s;s of the People
very great, as you may ob&s;erve by what I have &s;aid:
But the Rumor was infinitely greater, and it mu&s;t
not be wonder'd, that our Friends abroad, as my
Brother's Corre&s;pondents in particular were told there,
namely in <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> where he chiefly traded,
that in <HI>London</HI> there died twenty thou&s;and in a Week;
that the dead Bodies lay unburied by Heaps; that
the living were not &s;ufficient to bury the dead,
or the Sound to look after the Sick; that all
the Kingdom was infected likewi&s;e, &s;o that it was
an univer&s;al Malady, &s;uch as was never heard of in
tho&s;e parts of the World; and they could hardly
believe us, when we gave them an Account how
things really were, and how there was not above
one Tenth part of the People dead; that there was
500000 left that lived all the time in the Town;
that now the People began to walk the Streets
again, and tho&s;e, who were fled, to return, there
was no Mi&s;s of the u&s;ual Throng of people in the
Streets, except as every Family might mi&s;s their Re|lations
and Neighbours, and the like; I &s;ay they could
not believe the&s;e things; and if Enquiry were now
to be made in <HI>Naples,</HI> or in other Cities on the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Italy,</HI> they would tell you that there was
a dreadful Infection in <HI>London</HI> &s;o many Years ago;
<PB N="249" REF="251">
in which, <HI>as above,</HI> there died Twenty Thou&s;and
in a Week, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Ju&s;t as we have had it reported in
<HI>London,</HI> that there was a Plague in the City of <HI>Naples,</HI>
in the Year 1656, in which there died 20000 People
in a Day, of which I have had very good Satisfac|tion,
that it was utterly fal&s;e.</P>
<P>But the&s;e extravagant Reports were very preju|dicial
to our Trade as well as unju&s;t and injurious
in them&s;elves; for it was a long Time after the
Plague was quite over, before our Trade could re|cover
it &s;elf in tho&s;e parts of the World; and the
<HI>Flemings</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> but e&s;pecially the la&s;t, made
very great Advantages of it, having all the Market
to them&s;elves, and even buying our Manufactures
in the &s;everal Parts of <HI>England</HI> where the Plague
was not, and carrying them to <HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>Flan|ders,</HI>
and from thence tran&s;porting them to <HI>Spain,</HI>
and to <HI>Italy,</HI> as if they had been of their own mak|ing.</P>
<P>But they were detected &s;ometimes and puni&s;h'd,
that is to &s;ay, their Goods confi&s;cated, and Ships
al&s;o; for if it was true, that our Manufactures, as
well as our People, were infected, and that it was
dangerous to touch or to open, and receive the
Smell of them; then tho&s;e People ran the hazard by
that clande&s;tine Trade, not only of carrying the
Contagion into their own Country, but al&s;o of in|fecting
the Nations to whom they traded with tho&s;e
Goods; which, con&s;idering how many Lives might
be lo&s;t in Con&s;equence of &s;uch an Action, mu&s;t be
a Trade that no Men of Con&s;cience could &s;uffer
them&s;elves to be concern'd in.</P>
<P>I do not take upon me to &s;ay, that any harm was
done, I mean of that Kind, by tho&s;e People: But I
doubt, I need not make any &s;uch Provi&s;o in the
Ca&s;e of our own Country; for either by our Peo|ple
of <HI>London,</HI> or by the Commerce, which made
their conver&s;ing with all Sorts of People in every
<PB N="250" REF="252">
County, and of every con&s;iderable Town, nece&s;&s;ary,
I &s;ay, by this means the Plague was fir&s;t or la&s;t
&s;pread all over the Kingdom, as well in <HI>London</HI> as
in all the Cities and great Towns, e&s;pecially in the
trading Manufacturing Towns, and Sea-Ports; &s;o
that fir&s;t or la&s;t, all the con&s;iderable Places in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
were vi&s;ited more or le&s;s, and the Kingdom of
<HI>Ireland</HI> in &s;ome Places, but not &s;o univer&s;ally; how
it far'd with the People in <HI>Scotland,</HI> I had no op|portunity
to enquire.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erv'd, that while the Plague conti|nued
&s;o violent in <HI>London,</HI> the <HI>out Ports,</HI> as they are
call'd, enjoy'd a very great Trade, e&s;pecially to the
adjacent Countries, and to our own Plantations;
for Example, the Towns of <HI>Colche&s;ter, Yarmouth,</HI>
and <HI>Hull,</HI> on that &s;ide of <HI>England,</HI> exported to <HI>Hol|land</HI>
and <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> the Manufactures of the adja|cent
Counties for &s;everal Months after the Trade
with <HI>London</HI> was as it were entirely &s;hut up; like|wi&s;e
the Cities of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> and <HI>Exeter</HI> with the Port
of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> had the like Advantage to <HI>Spain,</HI> to
the <HI>Canaries,</HI> to <HI>Guinea,</HI> and to the <HI>We&s;t Indies;</HI>
and particularly to <HI>Ireland;</HI> but as the Plague &s;pread
it &s;elf every way after it had been in <HI>London,</HI> to &s;uch
a Degree as it was in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> and <HI>September;</HI> &s;o all,
or mo&s;t of tho&s;e Cities and Towns were infected
fir&s;t or la&s;t, and then Trade was as it were under a
general Embargo, or at a full &s;top, as I &s;hall ob|&s;erve
farther, when I &s;peak of our home Trade.</P>
<P>One thing however mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that as to
Ships coming in from Abroad, as many you may be
&s;ure did, &s;ome, who were out in all Parts of the World
a con&s;iderable while before, and &s;ome who when they
went out knew nothing of an Infection, or at lea&s;t of
one &s;o terrible; the&s;e came up the River boldly,
and delivered their Cargoes as they were oblig'd to
do, except ju&s;t in the two Months of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> and <HI>Sep|tember,</HI>
<PB N="251" REF="253">
when the Weight of the Infection lying,
as I may &s;ay, all below Bridge, no Body dur&s;t ap|pear
in Bu&s;ine&s;s for a while: But as this continued
but for a few Weeks, the Homeward bound Ships,
e&s;pecially &s;uch who&s;e Cargoes were not liable to
&s;poil, came to an Anchor for a Time, &s;hort of THE
POOL<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">That Part of the River where the Ships lye up when they come Home, is call'd the <HI>Pool,</HI> and takes in all the River on both Sides of the Water, from the <HI>Tower</HI> to <HI>Cuckold</HI>'s Point, and <HI>Lime|hou&s;e.</HI></NOTE>, or fre&s;h Water part of the River, even
as low as the River <HI>Medway,</HI> where &s;everal of them
ran in, and others lay at the <HI>Nore,</HI> and in the <HI>Hope</HI>
below <HI>Grave&s;end:</HI> So that by the latter end of <HI>Octo|ber,</HI>
there was a very great Fleet of Homeward
bound Ships to come up, &s;uch as the like had not
been known for many Years.</P>
<P>Two particular Trades were carried on by Water
Carriage all the while of the Infection, and that
with little or no Interruption, very much to the
Advantage and Comfort of the poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Peo|ple
of the City, and tho&s;e were the coa&s;ting Trade
for Corn, and the <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> Trade for Coals.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e was particularly carried on by
&s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, from the Port of <HI>Hull,</HI> and other
Places in the <HI>Humber,</HI> by which great Quantities
of Corn were brought in from <HI>York&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Lin|coln&s;hire:</HI>
The other part of this Corn-Trade was
from <HI>Lynn</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> from <HI>Wells,</HI> and <HI>Burnham,</HI>
and from <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> all in the &s;ame County; and
the third Branch was from the River <HI>Medway,</HI> and
from <HI>Milton, Fever&s;ham, Margate,</HI> and <HI>Sandwich,</HI>
and all the other little Places and Ports round the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI></P>
<P>There was al&s;o a very good Trade from the Coa&s;t
of <HI>Suffolk</HI> with Corn, Butter and Chee&s;e; the&s;e
Ve&s;&s;els kept a con&s;tant Cour&s;e of Trade, and with|out
Interruption came up to that Market known
<PB N="252" REF="254">
&s;till by the Name of <HI>Bear-Key,</HI> where they &s;upply'd
the City plentifully with Corn, when Land Carri|age
began to fail, and when the People began to
be &s;ick of coming from many Places in the Country.</P>
<P>This al&s;o was much of it owing to the Pru|dence
and Conduct of the Lord Mayor, who took
&s;uch care to keep the Ma&s;ters and Seamen from
Danger, when they came up, cau&s;ing their Corn to
be bought off at any time they wanted a Market,
(which however was very &s;eldom) and cau&s;ing the
Corn-Factors immediately to unlade and deliver the
Ve&s;&s;els loaden with Corn, that they had very little
occa&s;ion to come out of their Ships or Ve&s;&s;els, the
Money being always carried on Board to them, and
put into a Pail of Vinegar before it was car|ried.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Trade was, that of Coals from <HI>New|ca&s;tle</HI>
upon <HI>Tyne;</HI> without which the City would
have been greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; for not in the Streets
only, but in private Hou&s;es and Families, great
Quantities of Coals were then burnt, even all the
Summer long, and when the Weather was hotte&s;t,
which was done by the Advice of the Phy&s;icians;
&s;ome indeed oppos'd it, and in&s;i&s;ted that to keep
the Hou&s;es and Rooms hot, was a means to propa|gate
the Di&s;temper, which was a Fermentation and
Heat already in the Blood, that it was known to
&s;pread, and increa&s;e in hot Weather, and abate in
cold, and therefore they alledg'd that all contagious
Di&s;tempers are the wor&s;e for Heat, becau&s;e the Con|tagion
was nouri&s;hed, and gain'd Strength in hot
Weather, and was as it were propagated in Heat.</P>
<P>Others &s;aid, they granted, that Heat in the Cli|mate
might propagate Infection, as &s;ultry hot Wea|ther
fills the Air with Vermine, and nouri&s;hes innu|merable
Numbers, and Kinds of venomous Creatures,
which breed in our Food, in the Plants, and even in
our Bodies, by the very &s;tench of which, Infection
<PB N="253" REF="255">
may be propagated; al&s;o, that heat in the Air, or
heat of Weather, <HI>as we ordinarly call it,</HI> makes Bo|dies
relax and faint, exhau&s;ts the Spirits, opens the
Pores, and makes us more apt to receive Infection,
or any evil Influence, be it from noxious pe&s;tilen|tial
Vapors, or any other Thing in the Air: But
that the heat of Fire, and e&s;pecially of Coal Fires
kept in our Hou&s;es, or near us, had a quite different
Operation, the Heat being not of the &s;ame Kind,
but quick and fierce, tending not to nouri&s;h but to
con&s;ume, and di&s;&s;ipate all tho&s;e noxious Fumes,
which the other kind of Heat rather exhaled, and
&s;tagnated, than &s;eparated, and burnt up; be&s;ides it
was alledg'd, that the &s;ulphurous and nitrous Parti|cles,
that are often found to be in the Coal, with
that bituminous Sub&s;tance which burns, are all a&s;|&s;i&s;ting
to clear and purge the Air, and render it
whol&s;om and &s;afe to breath in, after the noctious
Particles as above are di&s;pers'd and burnt up.</P>
<P>The latter Opinion prevail'd at that Time, and
as I mu&s;t confe&s;s I think with good Rea&s;on, and
the Experience of the Citizens confirm'd it, many
Hou&s;es which had con&s;tant Fires kept in the Rooms,
having never been infected at all; and I mu&s;t join
my Experience to it, for I found the keeping good
Fires kept our Rooms &s;weet and whol&s;om, and I do
verily believe made our whole Family &s;o, more than
would otherwi&s;e have been.</P>
<P>But I return to the Coals as a Trade, it was with
no little difficulty that this Trade was kept open,
and particularly becau&s;e as we were in an open
War with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> at that Time, the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Capers at fir&s;t took a great many of our Collier
Ships, which made the re&s;t cautious, and made
them to &s;tay to come in Fleets together: But after
&s;ome time, the Capers were either afraid to take
them, or their Ma&s;ters, the States, were afraid they
&s;hould, and forbad them, le&s;t the Plague &s;hould be
<PB N="254" REF="256">
among them, which made them fare the bet|ter.</P>
<P>For the Security of tho&s;e <HI>Northern</HI> Traders, the
Coal Ships were order'd by my Lord Mayor, not
to come up into the <HI>Pool</HI> above a certain Number
at a Time, and order'd Lighters, and other Ve&s;&s;els,
&s;uch as the Wood-mongers, that is the <HI>Wharf</HI>
Keepers, or Coal-Sellers furni&s;hed, to go down, and
take out the Coals as low as <HI>Deptford</HI> and <HI>Green|wich,</HI>
and &s;ome farther down.</P>
<P>Others deliver'd great Quantities of Coals in par|ticular
Places, where the Ships cou'd come to the
Shoar, as at <HI>Greenwich, Blackwal,</HI> and other Pla|ces,
in va&s;t Heaps, as if to be kept for Sale; but
were then fetch'd away, after the Ships which
brought them were gone; &s;o that the Seamen had
no Communication with the River-Men, nor &s;o
much as came near one another.</P>
<P>Yet all this Caution, could not effectually pre|vent
the Di&s;temper getting among the Colliery,
that is to &s;ay, among the Ships, by which a great
many Seamen died of it; and that which was &s;till
wor&s;e, was, that they carried it down to <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI>
and <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> to <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne,</HI> and other
Places on the Coa&s;t; where, e&s;pecially at <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>
and at <HI>Sunderland,</HI> it carried off a great Number of
People.</P>
<P>The making &s;o many Fires as above, did indeed
con&s;ume an unu&s;ual Quantity of Coals; and that up|on
one or two &s;tops of the Ships coming up, whe|ther
by contrary Weather, or by the Interruption
of Enemies, I do not remember, but the Price of
Coals was exceeding dear, even as high as 4 l. a
Chalder, but it &s;oon abated when the Ships came
in, and as afterwards they had a freer Pa&s;&s;age, the
Price was very rea&s;onable all the re&s;t of that Year.</P>
<P>The publick Fires which were made on the&s;e
Occa&s;ions, as I have calculated it, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
<PB N="255" REF="257">
have co&s;t the City about 200 Chalder of Coals a
Week, if they had continued, which was in|deed
a very great Quantity; but as it was, thought
nece&s;&s;ary, nothing was &s;par'd; however as &s;ome of
the Phy&s;icians cry'd them down, they were not kept
a-light above four or five Days; the Fires were or|der'd
thus.</P>
<P>One at the <HI>Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e,</HI> one at <HI>Billing&s;gate,</HI> one
at <HI>Queen-hith,</HI> and one at the <HI>Three Cranes,</HI> one in
<HI>Black Friers,</HI> and one at the Gate of <HI>Bridewel,</HI> one
at the Corner of <HI>Leadenhal</HI> Street, and <HI>Grace-church,</HI>
one at the <HI>North,</HI> and one at the <HI>South</HI> Gate of the
<HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> one at <HI>Guild Hall,</HI> and one at
<HI>Blackwell-hall</HI> Gate, one at the Lord <HI>Mayor</HI>'s Door,
in St. <HI>Helens,</HI> one at the We&s;t Entrance <HI>in|to</HI>
St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, and one at the Entrance into <HI>Bow</HI>
Church: I do not remember whether there was any
at the City Gates, but one at the <HI>Bridge</HI> foot there
was, ju&s;t by St. <HI>Magnus</HI> Church.</P>
<P>I know, &s;ome have quarrell'd &s;ince that at the
Experiment, and &s;aid, that there died the more
People, becau&s;e of tho&s;e Fires; but I am per&s;uaded
tho&s;e that &s;ay &s;o, offer no Evidence to prove it,
neither can I believe it on any Account whatever.</P>
<P>It remains to give &s;ome Account of the State of
Trade at home in <HI>England</HI> during this dreadful
Time, and particularly as it relates to the Manufac|tures,
and the Trade in the City: At the fir&s;t break|ing
out of the Infection, there was, as it is ea&s;ie to
&s;uppo&s;e, a very great fright among the People, and
con&s;equently a general &s;top of Trade; except in
Provi&s;ions and Nece&s;&s;aries of Life, and even in
tho&s;e Things, as there was a va&s;t Number of People
fled, and a very great Number always &s;ick, be&s;ides
the Number which died, &s;o there could not be
above two Thirds, if above one Half of the Con|&s;umption
of Provi&s;ions in the City as u&s;ed to be.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="258">
It pleas'd God, to &s;end a very plentiful Year of
Corn and Fruit, but not of Hay or Gra&s;s; by
which means, Bread was cheap, by Rea&s;on of the
Plenty of Corn: Fle&s;h was cheap, by Rea&s;on of
the Scarcity of Gra&s;s; but Butter and Chee&s;e were
dear for the &s;ame Rea&s;on, and Hay in the Market
ju&s;t beyond <HI>White-Chapel</HI> Bars, was &s;old at 4l. <HI>per</HI>
Load. But that affected not the Poor; there was
a mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive Plenty of all Sorts of Fruit, &s;uch
as Apples, Pears, Plumbs, Cherries, Grapes; and
they were the cheaper, becau&s;e of the want of Peo|ple;
but this made the Poor eat them to exce&s;s, and
this brought them into Fluxes, griping of the Guts,
Surfeits, and the like, which often precipitated them
into the Plague.</P>
<P>But to come to Matters of Trade; fir&s;t, Foreign
Exportation being &s;topt, or at lea&s;t very much in|terrupted,
and rendred difficult; a general Stop
of all tho&s;e Manufactories followed of Cour&s;e, which
were u&s;ually bought for Exportation; and tho' &s;ome|times
Merchants Abroad were importunate for
Goods, yet little was &s;ent, the Pa&s;&s;ages being &s;o
generally &s;top'd, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships would not
be admitted, as is &s;aid already, into their Port.</P>
<P>This put a &s;top to the Manufactures, that were
for Exportation in mo&s;t Parts of <HI>England,</HI> except in
&s;ome out Ports; and even that was &s;oon &s;top'd,
for they all had the Plague in their Turn: But tho'
this was felt all over <HI>England,</HI> yet what was &s;till
wor&s;e, all Intercour&s;e of Trade for Home Con&s;ump|tion
of Manufactures, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which u&s;u|ally
circulated thro' the <HI>Londoners</HI> Hands, was &s;top'd
at once, the Trade of the City being &s;top'd.</P>
<P>All Kinds of Handicrafts in the City, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Trade&s;|men
and Mechanicks, were, as I have &s;aid be|fore,
out of Employ, and this occa&s;ion'd the putting
off, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ing an innumerable Number of Jour|ney-men,
and Work-men of all Sorts, &s;eeing no|thing
<PB N="257" REF="259">
was done relating to &s;uch Trades, but what
might be &s;aid to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>This cau&s;ed the Multitude of &s;ingle People in
<HI>London</HI> to be unprovided for; as al&s;o of Families,
who&s;e living depended upon the Labour of the
Heads of tho&s;e Families; I &s;ay, this reduced them
to extream Mi&s;ery; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s it is for the
Honour of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and will be for
many Ages, as long as this is to be &s;poken of, that
they were able to &s;upply with charitable Provi&s;ion,
the Wants of &s;o many Thou&s;ands of tho&s;e as after|wards
fell &s;ick, and were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; &s;o that it may
be &s;afely aver'd that no Body peri&s;hed for Want,
at le&s;t that the Magi&s;trates had any notice given
them of.</P>
<P>This Stagnation of our Manufacturing Trade in
the Country, would have put the People there to
much greater Difficulties, but that the Ma&s;ter-Workmen,
Clothiers and others, to the uttermo&s;t of
their Stocks and Strength, kept on making their
Goods to keep the Poor at Work, believing that
as &s;oon as the Sickne&s;s &s;hould abate, they would have
a quick Demand in Proportion to the Decay of
their Trade at that Time: But as none but tho&s;e
Ma&s;ters that were rich could do thus, and that
many were poor and not able, the Manufacturing
Trade in <HI>England</HI> &s;uffer'd greatly, and the Poor
were pinch'd all over <HI>England</HI> by the Calamity of
the City of <HI>London</HI> only.</P>
<P>It is true, that the next Year made them full
amends by another terrible Calamity upon the City;
&s;o that the City by one Calamity impoveri&s;hed and
weaken'd the Country, and by another Calamity
even terrible too of its Kind, enrich'd the Country
and made them again amends: For an infinite Quan|tity
of Hou&s;hold Stuff, wearing Apparel, and other
Things, be&s;ides whole Ware-hou&s;es fill'd with
Merchandize and Manufacturies, &s;uch as come from
<PB N="258" REF="260">
all Parts of <HI>England,</HI> were con&s;um'd in the Fire of
<HI>London,</HI> the next Year after this terrible Vi&s;itation:
It is incredible what a Trade this made all over the
whole Kingdom, to make good the Want, and to
&s;upply that Lo&s;s: So that, in &s;hort, all the manufactur|ing
Hands in the Nation were &s;et on Work, and
were little enough, for &s;everal Years, to &s;upply the
Market and an&s;wer the Demands; all Foreign Mar|kets,
al&s;o were empty of our Goods, by the &s;top
which had been occa&s;ioned by the Plague, and be|fore
an open Trade was allow'd again; and the
prodigious Demand at Home falling in join'd to
make a quick Vent for all Sorts of Goods; &s;o that
there never was known &s;uch a Trade all over <HI>Eng|land</HI>
for the Time, as was in the fir&s;t &s;even Years
after the Plague, and after the Fire of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>It remains now, that I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething of
the merciful Part of this terrible Judgment: The
la&s;t Week in <HI>September,</HI> the Plague being come to
its Cri&s;is, its Fury began to a&s;&s;wage. I remember
my Friend Doctor <HI>Heath</HI> coming to &s;ee me the
Week before, told me, he was &s;ure that the Vio|lence
of it would a&s;&s;wage in a few Days; but when
I &s;aw the weekly Bill of that Week, which was
the highe&s;t of the whole Year, being 8297 of all
Di&s;ea&s;es, I upbraided him with it, and a&s;k'd him,
what he had made his Judgment from? His An&s;wer,
however, was not &s;o much to &s;eek, as I thought it
would have been; look you, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> by the Number
which are at this Time &s;ick and infected, there &s;hould
have been twenty Thou&s;and dead the la&s;t Week, in|&s;tead
of eight Thou&s;and, if the inveterate mortal Con|tagion
had been, as it was two Weeks ago; for then
it ordinarily kill'd in two or three Days, now
not under Eight or Ten; and then not above One
in Five recovered; whereas I have ob&s;erv'd, that
now not above Two in Five mi&s;carry; and ob&s;erve
it from me, the next Bill will decrea&s;e, and you
<PB N="259" REF="261">
will &s;ee many more People recover than u&s;ed to do;
for tho' a va&s;t Multitude are now every where in|fected,
and as many every Day fall &s;ick; yet there
will not &s;o many die as there did, for the Maligni|ty
of the Di&s;temper is abated; adding, that he be|gan
now to hope, nay more than hope, that the
Infection had pa&s;s'd its Cri&s;is, and was going off; and
accordingly &s;o it was, for the next Week being, as
I &s;aid, the la&s;t in <HI>September,</HI> the Bill decrea&s;ed al|mo&s;t
two Thou&s;and.</P>
<P>It is true, the Plague was &s;till at a frightful
Height, and the next Bill was no le&s;s than 6460, and
the next to that 5720; but &s;till my Friend's Ob&s;er|vation
was ju&s;t, and it did appear the People did re|cover
fa&s;ter, and more in Number, than they u&s;ed
to do; and indeed if it had not been &s;o, what had been
the Condition of the City of <HI>London?</HI> for accord|ing
to my Friend there were not fewer than &s;ixty
Thou&s;and People at that Time infected, whereof, as
above, 20477 died, and near 40000 recovered; where|as
had it been as it was before, Fifty thou&s;and of
that Number would very probably have died, if
not more, and 50000 more would have &s;ickned; for
in a Word, the whole Ma&s;s of People began to
&s;icken, and it look'd as if none would e&s;cape.</P>
<P>But this Remark of my Friend's appear'd more
evident in a few Weeks more; for the Decrea&s;e
went on, and another Week in <HI>October</HI> it decreas'd
1849. So that the Number dead of the Plague
was but 2665, and the next Week it decrea&s;ed
1413 more, and yet it was &s;een plainly, that there
was abundance of People &s;ick, nay abundance more
than ordinary, and abundance fell &s;ick every Day,
but (as above) the Malignity of the Di&s;ea&s;e abated.</P>
<P>Such is the precipitant Di&s;po&s;ition of our Peo|ple,
whether it is &s;o or not all over the World,
that's none of my particular Bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire;
but I &s;aw it apparently here, that as upon the fir&s;t
<PB N="260" REF="262">
Fright of the Infection, they &s;hun'd one another,
and fled from one another's Hou&s;es, and from the
City with an unaccountable, and, as I thought, un|nece&s;&s;ary
Fright; &s;o now upon this Notion &s;pread|ing,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) that the Di&s;temper was not &s;o catch|ing
as formerly, and that if it was catch'd, it was not
&s;o mortal, and &s;eeing abundance of People
who really fell &s;ick, recover again daily; they
took to &s;uch a precipitant Courage, and grew &s;o
entirely regardle&s;s of them&s;elves, and of the Infec|tion,
that they made no more of the Plague than
of an ordinary Fever, not indeed &s;o much; they not
only went boldly into Company, with tho&s;e who
had Tumours and Carbuncles upon them, that were
running, and con&s;equently contagious, but eat and
drank with them, nay into their Hou&s;es to vi&s;it
them, and even, as I was told, into their very Cham|bers
where they lay &s;ick.</P>
<P>This I cou'd not &s;ee rational; my Friend Doc|tor
<HI>Heath</HI> allow'd, and it was plain to Experi|ence,
that the Di&s;temper was as catching as ever,
and as many fell &s;ick, but only he alledg'd, that &s;o
many of tho&s;e that fell &s;ick did not die; but I think
that while many did die, and that, at be&s;t, the Di|&s;temper
it &s;elf was very terrible, the Sores and
Swellings very tormenting, and the Danger of
Death not left out of the Circum&s;tance of Sickne&s;s,
tho' not &s;o frequent as before; all tho&s;e things, toge|ther
with the exceeding Tediou&s;ne&s;s of the Cure, the
Loath&s;omne&s;s of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and many other Articles,
were enough to deter any Man living from a dan|gerous
Mixture with the &s;ick People, and make them
as anxious almo&s;t to avoid the Infection as before.</P>
<P>Nay there was another Thing which made the
meer catching of the Di&s;temper frightful, and that
was the terrible burning of the Cau&s;ticks, which
the Surgeons laid on the Swellings to bring them
to break, and to run; without which the Danger
<PB N="261" REF="263">
of Death was very great, even to the la&s;t; al&s;o the
un&s;ufferable Torment of the Swellings, which tho'
it might not make People raving and di&s;tracted, as
they were before, and as I have given &s;everal In|&s;tances
of already, yet they put the Patient to in|expre&s;&s;ible
Torture; and tho&s;e that fell into it, tho'
they did e&s;cape with Life, yet they made bitter Com|plaints
of tho&s;e, that had told them there was no Dan|ger,
and &s;adly repented their Ra&s;hne&s;s and Folly in ven|turing
to run into the reach of it.</P>
<P>Nor did this unwary Conduct of the People
end here, for a great many that thus ca&s;t of their
Cautions &s;uffered more deeply &s;till; and tho' many
e&s;cap'd, yet many died; and at lea&s;t it had this pub|lick
Mi&s;chief attending it, that it made the De|crea&s;e
of Burials &s;lower than it would otherwi&s;e
have been; for as this Notion run like Lightning
thro' the City, and People Heads were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
with it, even as &s;oon as the fir&s;t great Decrea&s;e in
the Bills appear'd, we found, that the two next
Bills did not decrea&s;e in Proportion; the Rea&s;on I
take to be the Peoples running &s;o ra&s;hly into Dan|ger,
giving up all their former Cautions, and Care,
and all the Shyne&s;s which they u&s;ed to practi&s;e; de|pending
that the Sickne&s;s would not reach them,
or that if it did, they &s;hould not die.</P>
<P>The Phy&s;icians oppos'd this thoughtle&s;s Hu|mour
of the People with all their Might, and gave
out printed Directions, &s;preading them all over the
City and Suburbs, advi&s;ing the People to continue
re&s;erv'd, and to u&s;e &s;till the utmo&s;t Caution in their or|dinary
Conduct, notwith&s;tanding the Decrea&s;e of the
Di&s;temper, terrifying them with the Danger of bring
ing a Relap&s;e upon the whole City, and telling them
how &s;uch a Relap&s;e might be more fatal and dan|gerous
than the whole Vi&s;itation that had been
already; with many Arguments and Rea&s;ons to ex|plain
and prove that part to them, and which are
too long to repeat here.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="264">
But it was all to no Purpo&s;e, the audacious Crea|tures
were &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the fir&s;t Joy, and &s;o
&s;urpriz'd with the Satisfaction of &s;eeing a va&s;t De|crea&s;e
in the weekly Bills, that they were impene|trable
by any new Terrors, and would not be per|&s;uaded,
but that the Bitterne&s;s of Death was pa&s;s'd;
and it was to no more purpo&s;e to talk to them,
than to an Ea&s;t-wind; but they open'd Shops, went
about Streets, did Bu&s;ine&s;s, and conver&s;ed with any
Body that came in their Way to conver&s;e with,
whether with Bu&s;ine&s;s, or without, neither inqui|ring
of their Health, or &s;o much as being Apprehen|&s;ive
of any Danger from them, tho' they knew
them not to be &s;ound.</P>
<P>This imprudent ra&s;h Conduct co&s;t a great many
their Lives, who had with great Care and Caution
&s;hut them&s;elves up, and kept retir'd as it were from
all Mankind, and had by that means, under God's
Providence, been pre&s;erv'd thro' all the heat of that
Infection.</P>
<P>This ra&s;h and fooli&s;h Conduct, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> of the People
went &s;o far, that the Mini&s;ters took notice to them
of it at la&s;t, and laid before them both the Folly
and Danger of it; and this check'd it a little, &s;o
that they grew more cautious, but it had another
Effect, which they cou'd not check; for as the fir&s;t
Rumour had &s;pread not over the City only, but in|to
the Country, it had the like Effect, and the Peo|ple
were &s;o tir'd with being &s;o long from <HI>London,</HI>
and &s;o eager to come back, that they flock'd to
Town without Fear or Foreca&s;t, and began to &s;hew
them&s;elves in the Streets, as if all the Danger was
over: It was indeed &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee it, for tho' there
died &s;till from a Thou&s;and to eighteen Hundred a
Week, yet the People flock'd to Town, as if all
had been well.</P>
<P>The Con&s;equence of this was, that the Bills en|creas'd
again Four Hundred the very fir&s;t Week in
<PB N="263" REF="265">
<HI>November;</HI> and if I might believe the Phy&s;icians,
there was above three Thou&s;and fell &s;ick that
Week, mo&s;t of them new Comers too.</P>
<P><HI>One JOHN COCK,</HI> a Barber in St. <HI>Martins le
Grand,</HI> was an eminent Example of this; I mean
of the ha&s;ty Return of the People, when the
Plague was abated: This <HI>John Cock</HI> had left the
Town with his whole Family, and lock'd up his
Hou&s;e, and was gone in the Country, as many
others did, and finding the Plague &s;o decreas'd in
<HI>November,</HI> that there died but 905 <HI>per</HI> Week of
all Di&s;ea&s;es, he ventur'd home again; he had in his
Family Ten Per&s;ons, that is to &s;ay, him&s;elf and
Wife, five Children, two Apprentices, and a Maid
Servant; he had not been return'd to his Hou&s;e
above a Week, and began to open his Shop, and
carry on his Trade, but the Di&s;temper broke out
in his Family, and within about five Days they all
died, except one, that is to &s;ay, him&s;elf, his Wife,
all his five Children, and his two Apprentices, and
only the Maid remain'd alive.</P>
<P>But the Mercy of God was greater to the re&s;t than
had Rea&s;on to expect; for the Malignity, as I have
&s;aid, of the Di&s;temper was &s;pent, the Contagion
was exhau&s;ted, and al&s;o the Winter Weather came
on apace, and the Air was clear and cold, with
&s;ome &s;harp Fro&s;ts; and this encrea&s;ing &s;till, mo&s;t of
tho&s;e that had fallen &s;ick recover'd, and the Health
of the City began to return: There were indeed &s;ome
Returns of the Di&s;temper, even in the Month of
<HI>December,</HI> and the Bills encrea&s;ed near a Hundred,
but it went off again and &s;o in a &s;hort while,
Things began to return to their own Channel. And
wonderful it was to &s;ee how populous the City was
again all on a &s;udden; &s;o that a Stranger could not
mi&s;s the Numbers that were lo&s;t, neither was there any
mi&s;s of the Inhabitants as to their Dwellings: Few
or no empty Hou&s;es were to be &s;een, or if there
<PB N="264" REF="266">
were &s;ome, there was no want of Tenants for
them.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I cou'd &s;ay, that as the City had a new
Face, &s;o the Manners of the People had a new Ap|pearance:
I doubt not but there were many that
retain'd a &s;incere Sen&s;e of their Deliverance, and
that were heartily thankful to that &s;overeign Hand,
that had protected them in &s;o dangerous a Time; it
would be very uncharitablee to judge otherwi&s;e in
a City &s;o populous, and where the People were &s;o
devout, as they were here in the Time of the Vi&s;i|tation
it &s;elf; but except what of this was to be
found in particular Families, and Faces, it mu&s;t be
acknowledg'd that the general Practice of the Peo|ple
was ju&s;t as it was before, and very little Difference
was to be &s;een.</P>
<P>Some indeed &s;aid Things were wor&s;e, that the
Morals of the People declin'd from this vere time;
that the People harden'd by the Danger they had
been in, like Sea-men after a Storm is over, were
more wicked and more &s;tupid, more bold and
hardened in their Vices and Immoralities than they
were before; but I will not carry it &s;o far neither:
It would take up a Hi&s;tory of no &s;mall Length,
to give a Particular of all the Gradations, by which
the Cour&s;e of Things in this City came to be re|&s;tor'd
again, and to run in their own Channel as
they did before.</P>
<P>Some Parts of <HI>England</HI> were now infected as violent|ly
as <HI>London</HI> had been; the Cities of <HI>Norwich, Peter|borough,
Lincoln, Colche&s;ter,</HI> and other Places were
now vi&s;ited; and the Magi&s;trates of <HI>London</HI> began to &s;et
Rules for our Conduct, as to corre&s;ponding with
tho&s;e Cities: It is true, we could not pretend to
forbid their People coming to <HI>Loudon,</HI> becau&s;e it
was impo&s;&s;ible to know them a&s;&s;under, &s;o after many
Con&s;ultations, the Lord Mayor, and Court of Al|dermen
were oblig'd to drop it: All they cou'd do,
<PB N="265" REF="267">
was to warn and caution the People, not to enter|tain
in their Hou&s;es, or conver&s;e with any People
who they knew came from &s;uch infected Places.</P>
<P>But they might as well have talk'd to the Air,
for the People of <HI>London</HI> thought them&s;elves &s;o
Plague-free now, that they were pa&s;t all Admoniti|ons;
they &s;eem'd to depend upon it, that the Air
was re&s;tor'd, and that the Air was like a Man that
had had the Small Pox, not capable of being infected
again; this reviv'd that Notion, that the Infection
was all in the Air, that there was no &s;uch thing as
Contagion from the &s;ick People to the Sound; and
&s;o &s;trongly did this Whim&s;y prevail among Peo|ple,
that they run all together promi&s;cuou&s;ly, &s;ick
and well; not the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> who, prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd
with the Principle of Prede&s;tination value nothing
of Contagion, let it be in what it will, could be
more ob&s;tinate than the People of <HI>London;</HI> they
that were perfectly &s;ound, and came out of the
whole&s;ome Air, as we call it, into the City, made
nothing of going into the &s;ame Hou&s;es and Cham|bers
nay even into the &s;ame Beds, with tho&s;e that
had the Di&s;temper upon them, and were not reco|vered.</P>
<P>Some indeed paid for their audacious Boldne&s;s
with the Price of their Lives; an infinite Num|ber
fell &s;ick, and the Phy&s;icians had more Work
than ever, only with this Difference, that more of
their Patients recovered; that is to &s;ay, they gene|rally
recovered, but certainly there were more Peo|ple
infected, and fell &s;ick now, when there did not
die above a Thou&s;and, or Twelve Hundred in a
Week, than there was when there died Five or
Six Thou&s;and a Week; &s;o entirely negligent were
the People at that Time, in the great and dangerous
Ca&s;e of Health and Infection; and &s;o ill were
they able to take or accept of the Advice of
tho&s;e who cautioned them for their Good.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="268">
The People being thus return'd, as it were in ge|neral,
it was very &s;trange to find, that in their in|quiring
after their Friends, &s;ome whole Families
were &s;o entirely &s;wept away, that there was no Re|membrance
of them left; neither was any Body to
be found to po&s;&s;e&s;s or &s;hew any Title to that little
they had left; for in &s;uch Ca&s;es, what was to be
found was generally embezzled, and purloyn'd &s;ome
gone one way, &s;ome another.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid &s;uch abandon'd Effects, came to the King
as the univer&s;al Heir, upon which we were told, and I
&s;uppo&s;e it was in part true, that the King granted all
&s;uch as Deodands to the Lord Mayor and Court of
Aldermen of <HI>London,</HI> to be applied to the u&s;e of the
Poor, of whom there were very many: For it is to
be ob&s;erv'd, that tho' the Occa&s;ions of Relief, and
the Objects of Di&s;tre&s;s were very many more in the
Time of the Violence of the Plague, than now
after all was over; yet the Di&s;tre&s;s of the Poor was
more now, a great deal than it was then, becau&s;e
all the Sluces of general Charity were now &s;hut;
People &s;uppos'd the main Occa&s;ion to be over, and
&s;o &s;top'd their Hands; whereas particular Objects
were &s;till very moving, and the Di&s;tre&s;s of tho&s;e
that were Poor, was very great indeed.</P>
<P>Tho' the Health of the City was now very much
re&s;tor'd, yet Foreign Trade did not begin to &s;tir,
neither would Foreigners admit our Ships into their
Ports for a great while; as for the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the Mi&s;|under&s;tandings
between our Court and them had bro|ken
out into a War the Year before; &s;o that our
Trade that way was wholly interrupted; but <HI>Spain</HI>
and <HI>Portugal, Italy</HI> and <HI>Barbary,</HI> as al&s;o <HI>Hamburgh,</HI>
and all the Ports in the <HI>Baltick,</HI> the&s;e were all &s;hy
of us a great while, and would not re&s;tore Trade with
us for many Months.</P>
<P>The Di&s;temper &s;weeping away &s;uch Multitudes,
as I have ob&s;erv'd, many, if not all the out Pari&s;hes
<PB N="267" REF="269">
were oblig'd to make new burying Grounds, be|&s;ides
that I have mention'd in <HI>Bunhil-Fields,</HI> &s;ome
of which were continued, and remain in U&s;e to
this Day; but others were left off, and which, I
confe&s;s, I mention with &s;ome Reflection, being
converted into other U&s;es, or built upon afterwards,
the dead Bodies were di&s;turb'd, abus'd, dug up
again, &s;ome even before the Fle&s;h of them was pe|ri&s;hed
from the Bones, and remov'd like Dung or
Rubbi&s;h to other Places; &s;ome of tho&s;e which came
within the Reach of my Ob&s;ervation, are as fol|low.</P>
<P>1.
A piece of Ground beyond <HI>Go&s;wel</HI> Street,
near <HI>Mount-Mill,</HI> being &s;ome of the Remains of
the old Lines or Fortifications of the City, where
Abundance were buried promi&s;cuou&s;ly from the Pa|ri&s;hes
of <HI>Alder&s;gate, Clerkenwell,</HI> and even out of
the City. This Ground, as I take it, was &s;ince
made a Phy&s;ick Garden, and after that has been
built upon.</P>
<P>2. A piece of Ground ju&s;t over the <HI>Black Ditch,</HI>
as it was then call'd, at the end of <HI>Holloway Lane,</HI>
in <HI>Shoreditch</HI> Pari&s;h; it has been &s;ince made a Yard
for keeping Hogs, and for other ordinary U&s;es, but
is quite out of U&s;e as a burying Ground.</P>
<P>3. The upper End of <HI>Hand-Alley</HI> in <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate</HI>
Street, which was then a green Field, and was ta|ken
in particularly for <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate</HI> Pari&s;h, tho' many
of the Carts out of the City brought their dead
thither al&s;o, particularly out of the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>All|hallows</HI>
on the <HI>Wall;</HI> this Place I cannot mention
without much Regret, it was, as I remember, about
two or three Year after the Plague was ceas'd that
Sir <HI>Robert Clayton</HI> came to be po&s;&s;e&s;t of the Ground;
it was reported, how true I know not, that it fell
to the King for want of Heirs, all tho&s;e who had
any Right to it being carried off by the Pe&s;tilence,
and that Sir <HI>Robert Clayton</HI> obtain'd a Grant of it
<PB N="268" REF="270">
from King <HI>Charles</HI> II. But however he came by
it, certain it is, the Ground was let out to build
on, or built upon by his Order: The fir&s;t Hou&s;e
built upon it was a large fair Hou&s;e &s;till &s;tanding,
which faces the Street, or Way, now call'd <HI>Hand-Alley,</HI>
which, tho' call'd an <HI>Alley,</HI> is as wide as a
Street: The Hou&s;es in the &s;ame Row with that
Hou&s;e Northward, are built on the very &s;ame
Ground where the poor People were buried, and
the Bodies on opening the Ground for the Foun|dations,
were dug up, &s;ome of them remaining &s;o
plain to be &s;een, that the Womens Sculls were di|&s;tingui&s;h'd
by their long Hair, and of others, the
Fle&s;h was not quite peri&s;hed; &s;o that the People be|gan
to exclaim loudly again&s;t it, and &s;ome &s;ugge&s;ted
that it might endanger a Return of the Contagi|on:
After which the Bones and Bodies, as fa&s;t as
they came at them, were carried to another part of
the &s;ame Ground, and thrown all together into a
deep Pit, dug on purpo&s;e, which now is to be
known, in that it is not built on, but is a Pa&s;&s;age
to another Hou&s;e, at the upper end of <HI>Ro&s;e Alley,</HI>
ju&s;t again&s;t the Door of a Meeting-hou&s;e, which has
been built there many Years &s;ince; and the Ground
is pali&s;adoed off from the re&s;t of the Pa&s;&s;age, in a
little &s;quare, there lye the Bones and Remains of
near Two thou&s;and Bodies, carried by the Dead-Carts
to to their Grave in that one Year.</P>
<P>4. Be&s;ides this, there was a piece of Ground in
<HI>Moorfields,</HI> by the going into the Street which is
now call'd <HI>Old Bethlem,</HI> which was enlarg'd much,
tho' not wholly taken in on the &s;ame occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> The Author of this Journal, lyes buried
in that very Ground, being at his own De&s;ire, his
Si&s;ter having been buried there a few Years be|fore.</P>
<P>5.
<HI>Stepney</HI> Pari&s;h, extending it &s;elf from the Ea&s;t
part of <HI>London</HI> to the <HI>North,</HI> even to the very
<PB N="269" REF="271">
Edge of <HI>Shoreditch</HI> Church-yard, had a piece of
Ground taken in to bury their Dead, clo&s;e to the
&s;aid Church-yard, and which for that very Rea&s;on was
left open, and is &s;ince, I &s;uppo&s;e, taken into the &s;ame
Church-yard; and they had al&s;o two other burying
Places in <HI>Spittlefields,</HI> one where &s;ince a Chapel or
Tabernacle has been built for ea&s;e to this great
Pari&s;h, and another in <HI>Petticoat-lane.</HI></P>
<P>There were no le&s;s than Five other Grounds
made u&s;e of for the Pari&s;h of <HI>Stepney</HI> at that time;
one where now &s;tands the Pari&s;h Church of St.
<HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Shadwel,</HI> and the other, where now &s;tands
the Pari&s;h Church of St. <HI>John</HI> at <HI>Wapping,</HI> both
which had not the Names of Pari&s;hes at that time,
but were belonging to <HI>Stepney</HI> Pari&s;h.</P>
<P>I cou'd name many more, but the&s;e coming
within my particular Knowledge, the Circum&s;tance
I thought made it of U&s;e to record them; from
the whole, it may be ob&s;erv'd, that they were ob|lig'd
in this Time of Di&s;tre&s;s, to take in new bury|ing
Grounds in mo&s;t of the out Pari&s;hes, for lay|ing
the prodigious Numbers of People which died
in &s;o &s;hort a Space of Time; but why Care was not
taken to keep tho&s;e Places &s;eparate from ordinary
U&s;es, that &s;o the Bodies might re&s;t undi&s;turb'd,
that I cannot an&s;wer for, and mu&s;t confe&s;s, I think it
was wrong; who were to blame, I know not.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have mention'd, that the Quakers had
at that time al&s;o a burying Ground, &s;et a-part to
their U&s;e, and which they &s;till make u&s;e of, and
they had al&s;o a particular <HI>dead Cart</HI> to fetch their
Dead from their Hou&s;es; and the famous <HI>Solomon
Eagle,</HI> who, as I mentioned before, had predicted the
Plague as a Judgment, and run naked thro' the
Streets, telling the People, that it was come upon
them, to puni&s;h them for their Sins, had his own
Wife died the very next Day of the Plague,
<PB N="290" REF="272">
and was carried one of the fir&s;t in the Quakers
<HI>dead Cart,</HI> to their new burying Ground.</P>
<P>I might have throng'd this Account with many
more remarkable Things, which occur'd in the Time
of the Infection, and particularly what pa&s;s'd be|tween
the Lord Mayor and the Court, which was
then at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and what Directions were from
time to time receiv'd from the Government for
their Conduct on this critical Occa&s;ion. But really
the Court concern'd them&s;elves &s;o little, and that
little they did was of &s;o &s;mall Import, that I do
not &s;ee it of much Moment to mention any Part
of it here, except that of appointing a Monthly
Fa&s;t in the City, and the &s;ending the Royal Chari|ty
to the Relief of the Poor, both which I have
mention'd before.</P>
<P>Great was the Reproach thrown on tho&s;e Phy&s;i|cians
who left their Patients during the Sickne&s;s,
and now they came to Town again, no Body car'd
to employ them; they were call'd De&s;erters, and
frequently Bills were &s;et up upon their Doors, and
written, <HI>Here is a Doctor to be let!</HI> So that &s;everal
of tho&s;e Phy&s;icians were fain for a while to &s;it &s;till
and look about them, or at lea&s;t remove their Dwel|lings,
and &s;et up in new Places, and among new
Acquaintance; the like was the Ca&s;e with the Clergy,
who the People were indeed very abu&s;ive to, writ|ing
Ver&s;es and &s;candalous Reflections upon them,
&s;etting upon the Church Door, <HI>here is a Pulpit to
be let,</HI> or &s;ometimes <HI>to be &s;old,</HI> which was wor&s;e.</P>
<P>It was not the lea&s;t of our Misfortunes, that with
our Infection, when it cea&s;ed, there did not cea&s;e the
Spirit of Strife and Contention, Slander and Reproach,
which was really the great Troubler of the Nation's
Peace before: It was &s;aid to be the Remains of the
old Animo&s;ities, which had &s;o lately involv'd us all
in Blood and Di&s;order. But as the late Act of In|demnity
had laid a&s;leep the Quarrel it &s;elf, &s;o the
<PB N="291" REF="273">
Government had recommended Family and Per&s;o|nal
Peace upon all Occa&s;ions, to the whole Na|tion.</P>
<P>But it cou'd not be obtain'd, and particularly after
the cea&s;ing of the Plague in <HI>London,</HI> when any one
that had &s;een the Condition which the People had
been in, and how they care&s;s'd one another at that
time, promis'd to have more Charity for the future,
and to rai&s;e no more Reproaches: I &s;ay, any one
that had &s;een them then, would have thought they
would have come together with another Spirit at
la&s;t. But, I &s;ay, it cou'd not be obtain'd; the Qua|rel
remain'd, the Church and the Pre&s;byterians
were incompatible; as &s;oon as the Plague was re|mov'd,
the di&s;&s;enting outed Mini&s;ters who had
&s;upplied the Pulpits, which were de&s;erted by the
Incumbents, retir'd, they cou'd expect no other;
but that they &s;hould immediately fall upom them,
and harra&s;s them, with their penal Laws, accept
their preaching while they were &s;ick, and per&s;ecute
them as &s;oon as they were recover'd again, this even
we that were of the Church thought was very
hard, and cou'd by no means approve of it.</P>
<P>But it was the Government, and we cou'd &s;ay
nothing to hinder it; we cou'd only &s;ay, it was not
our doing, and we could not an&s;wer for it.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Di&s;&s;enters reproaching
tho&s;e Mini&s;ters of the Church with going away,
and de&s;erting their Charge, abandoning the People
in their Danger, and when they had mo&s;t need of
Comfort and the like, this we cou'd by no means
approve; for all Men have not the &s;ame Faith, and
the &s;ame Courage, and the Scripture commands us
to judge the mo&s;t favourably, and according to Cha|rity.</P>
<P>A Plague is a formidable Enemy, and is arm'd
with Terrors, that every Man is not &s;ufficiently
fortified to re&s;i&s;t, or prepar'd to &s;tand the Shock

again&s;t: It is very certain, that a great many
of the Clergy, who were in Circum&s;tances to do it,
withdrew, and fled for the Safety of their Lives;
but 'tis true al&s;o, that a great many of them &s;taid,
and many of them fell in the Calamity, and in the
Di&s;charge of their Duty.</P>
<P>It is true, &s;ome of the Di&s;&s;enting turn'd out Mi|ni&s;ters
&s;taid, and their Courage is to be commend|ed,
and highly valued, but the&s;e were not abun|dance;
it cannot be &s;aid that they all &s;taid, and
that none retir'd into the Country, any more than
it can be &s;aid of the Church Clergy, that they all
went away; neither did all tho&s;e that went away,
go without &s;ub&s;tituting Curates, and others in their
Places, to do the Offices needful, and to vi&s;it the
Sick, as far as it was practicable; &s;o that upon the
whole, an Allowance of Charity might have been
made on both Sides, and we &s;hould have con&s;ider'd,
that &s;uch a time as this of 1665, is not to be parallel'd
in Hi&s;tory, and that it is not the &s;toute&s;t Courage
that will always &s;upport Men in &s;uch Ca&s;es; I had
not &s;aid this, but had rather cho&s;en to record
the Courage and religious Zeal of tho&s;e of both
Sides, who did hazard them&s;elves for the Service of
the poor People in their Di&s;tre&s;s, without remem|bring
that any fail'd in their Duty on either &s;ide.
But the want of Temper among us, has made
the contrary to this nece&s;&s;ary; &s;ome that &s;taid, not
only boa&s;ting too much of them&s;elves, but revil|ing
tho&s;e that fled, branding them with Cowardice,
de&s;erting their Flocks, and acting the Part of the
Hirleing, and the like: I recommend it to the Cha|rity
of all good People to look back, and reflect duly
upon the Terrors of the Time; and whoever does
&s;o will &s;ee, that it is not an ordinary Strength that
cou'd &s;upport it, it was not like appearing in the
Head of an Army, or charging a Body or Hor&s;e
in the Field; but it was charging Death it &s;elf
<PB N="273" REF="277">
on his pale Hor&s;e; to &s;tay was indeed to die, and it
could be e&s;teemed nothing le&s;s, e&s;pecially as things
appear'd at the latter End of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and the Be|ginning
of <HI>September,</HI> and as there was rea&s;on to
expect them at that time; for no Man expected,
and I dare &s;ay, believed, that the Di&s;temper would
take &s;o &s;udden a Turn as it did, and fall imme|diately
2000 in a Week, when there was &s;uch a
prodigious Number of People &s;ick at that Time,
as it was known there was; and then it was that
many &s;hifted away, that had &s;tay'd mo&s;t of the time
before.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if God gave Strength to &s;ome more than
to others, was it to boa&s;t of their Ability to abide
the Stroak, and upbraid tho&s;e that had not the &s;ame
Gift and Support, or ought not they rather to have
been humble and thankful, if they were render'd
more u&s;eful than their Brethren?</P>
<P>I think it ought to be recorded to the Honour of
&s;uch Men, as well Clergy as Phy&s;icians, Sur|geons,
Apothecaries, Magiftrates and Officers of
every kind, as al&s;o all u&s;eful People, who ventur'd their
Lives in Di&s;charge of their Duty, as mo&s;t cer|tainly
all &s;uch as &s;tay'd did to the la&s;t Degree,
and &s;everal of all the&s;e Kinds did not only venture
but lo&s;e their Lives on that &s;ad Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I was once making a Li&s;t of all &s;uch, I mean of
all tho&s;e Profe&s;&s;ions and Employments, who thus
died, as I call it, in the way of their Duty, but it
was impo&s;&s;ible for a private Man to come at a
Certainty in the Particulats; I only remember, that
there died &s;ixteen Clergy-men, two Aldermen, five
Phy&s;icians, thirteen Surgeons, within the City and
Liberties before the beginning of <HI>September:</HI> But
this being, as I &s;aid before, the great Cri&s;is and Extre|mity
of the Infection, it can be no compleat Li&s;t: As
to inferior People, I think there died &s;ix and forty
<PB N="274" REF="278">
Con&s;tables and Headboroughs in the two Pari&s;hes of
<HI>Stepney</HI> and <HI>White-Chapel;</HI> but I could not carry
my Li&s;t on, for when the violent Rage of the Di|&s;temper
in <HI>September</HI> came upon us, it drove us out
of all Mea&s;ures: Men did then no more die by Tale
and by Number, they might put out a Weekly
Bill, and call them &s;even or eight Thou&s;and, or
what they pleas'd; 'tis certain they died by Heaps,
and were buried by Heaps, that is to &s;ay without Ac|count;
and if I might believe &s;ome People, who
were more abroad and more conver&s;ant with tho&s;e
things than I, tho' I was public enough for one
that had no more Bu&s;ine&s;s to do than I had, I &s;ay,
if I may believe them, there was not many le&s;s bu|ried
tho&s;e fir&s;t three Weeks in <HI>September</HI> than 20000
<HI>per</HI> Week; however the others aver the Truth of
it, yet I rather chu&s;e to keep to the public Account;
&s;even and eight thou&s;and <HI>per</HI> Week is enough to
make good all that I have &s;aid of the Terror of tho&s;e
Times; and it is much to the Satisfaction of me
that write, as well as tho&s;e that read, to be able to
&s;ay, that every thing is &s;et down with Moderation,
and rather within Compa&s;s than beyond it.</P>
<P>Upon all the&s;e Accounts I &s;ay I could wi&s;h, when
we were recover'd, our Conduct had been more
di&s;tingui&s;h'd for Charity and Kindne&s;s in Remem|brance
of the pa&s;t Calamity, and not &s;o much a
valuing our &s;elves upon our Boldne&s;s in &s;taying, as
if all Men were Cowards that fly from the Hand
of God, or that tho&s;e, who &s;tay, do not &s;ometimes
owe their Courage to their Ignorance, and de&s;pi&s;ing
the Hand of their Maker, which is a criminal kind
of De&s;peration, and not a true Courage.</P>
<P>I cannot but leave it upon Record, that the Civil
Officers, &s;uch as Con&s;tables, Headboroughs, Lord
Mayor's, and Sheriff' s-men, as al&s;o Pari&s;h-Officers,
who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s it was to take Charge of the Poor,
<PB N="275" REF="279">
did their Duties in general with as much Courage
as any, and perhaps with more, becau&s;e their Work
was attended with more Hazards, and lay more
among the Poor, who were more &s;ubject to be in|fected
and in the mo&s;t pitiful Plight when they were
taken with the Infection: But then it mu&s;t be ad|ded
too, that a great Number of them died, indeed it
was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>I have not &s;aid one Word here about the Phy&s;ick
or Preparations that we ordinarily made u&s;e of on this
terrible Occa&s;ion, I mean we that went frequently
abroad up and down Street, as I did; much of this
was talk'd of in the Books and Bills of our Quack
Doctors, of whom I have &s;aid enough already.
It may however be added, that the College of Phy|&s;icians
were daily publi&s;hing &s;everal Preparations,
which they had con&s;ider'd of in the Proce&s;s of their
Practice, and which being to be had in Print, I
avoid repeating them for that rea&s;on.</P>
<P>One thing I could not help ob&s;erving, what be|fell
one of the Quacks, who publi&s;h'd that he had a
mo&s;t excellent Pre&s;ervative again&s;t the Plague, which
whoever kept about them, &s;hould never be in|fected,
or liable to Infection; this Man, who we
may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, did not go abroad without
&s;ome of this <HI>excellent Pre&s;ervative</HI> in his Pocket, yet
was taken by the Di&s;temper, and carry'd off in two
or three Days</P>
<P>I am not of the Number of the Phy&s;ic-Haters,
or Phy&s;ic-De&s;pi&s;ers; on the contrary, I have often
mentioned the regard I had to the Dictates of my
particular Friend Dr. <HI>Heath;</HI> but yet I mu&s;t ac|knowledge,
I made u&s;e of little or nothing, except
as I have ob&s;erv'd, to keep a Preparation of &s;trong
Scent to have ready, in ca&s;e I met with any thing
of offen&s;ive Smells, or went too near any burying
place, or dead Body.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="280">
Neither did I do, what I know &s;ome did, keep
the Spirits always high and hot with Cordials, and
Wine, and &s;uch things, and which, as I ob&s;erv'd, one
learned Phy&s;ician u&s;ed him&s;elf &s;o much to, as that
he could not leave them off when the Infection was
quite gone, and &s;o became a Sot for all his Life
after.</P>
<P>I remember, my Friend the Doctor us'd to &s;ay,
that there was a certain Set of Drugs and Preparations,
which were all certainly good and u&s;eful in the ca&s;e
of an Infection; out of which, or with which, Phy|&s;icians
might make an infinite Variety of Medicines,
as the Ringers of Bells make &s;everal Hundred diffe|rent
Rounds of Mu&s;ick by the changing and Or|der
of Sound but in &s;ix Bells; and that all the&s;e Prepara|tions
&s;hall be really very good; therefore, &s;aid he, I do
not wonder that &s;o va&s;t a Throng of Medicines is of|ffer'd
in the pre&s;ent Calamity; and almo&s;t every Phy&s;i|cian
pre&s;cribes or prepares a different thing, as his
Judgment or Experience guides him: but, &s;ays
my Friend, let all the Prescriptions of all the Phy|&s;icians
in <HI>London</HI> be examined; and it will be found,
that they are all compounded of the &s;ame things,
with &s;uch Variations only, as the particular Fancy
of the Doctor leads him to; &s;o that, &s;ays he, every
Man judging a little of his own Con&s;titution and
manner of his living, and Circum&s;tances of
his being infected, may direct his own Medicines
out of the ordinary Drugs and Preparations:
Only that, &s;ays he, &s;ome recommend one thing as
mo&s;t &s;overeign, and &s;ome another; &s;ome, &s;ays he,
think that <HI>Pill. Ruff.</HI> which is call'd it&s;elf the Anti|pe&s;tilential
Pill, is the be&s;t Preparation that can be
made; others think, that <HI>Venice</HI> Treacle is &s;ufficient
of it &s;elf to re&s;i&s;t the Contagion, and I, &s;ays he,
think as both the&s;e think, <HI>viz.</HI> that the la&s;t is good
to take beforehand to prevent it, and the la&s;t, if
touch'd, to expel it. According to this Opinion. I
<PB N="277" REF="281">
&s;everal times took <HI>Venice Treacle</HI> and a &s;ound Sweat
upon it, and thought my &s;elf as well fortified again&s;t
the Infection as any one could be fortifyed by the
Power of Phy&s;ic.</P>
<P>As for Quackery and Mountebank, of which the
Town was &s;o full, I li&s;tened to none of them, and
have ob&s;erv'd often &s;ince with &s;ome Wonder, that
for two Years after the Plague, I &s;carcely &s;aw or
heard of one of them about Town. Some fancied
they were all &s;wept away in the Infection to a Man,
and were for calling it a particular Mark of God's
Vengeance upon them, for leading the poor People
into the Pit of De&s;truction, merely for the Lucre of
a little Money they got by them; but I cannot go
that Length neither; that Abundance of them died
is certain, many of them came within the Reach
of my own Knowledge; but that all of them were
&s;wept off I much que&s;tion; I believe rather, they
fled into the Country, and tryed their Practices
upon the People there, who were in Apprehen&s;ion
of the Infection, before it came among them.</P>
<P>This however is certain, not a Man of them ap|pear'd
for a great while in or about <HI>London;</HI> there
were indeed &s;everal Doctors, who publi&s;hed Bills, re|commending
their &s;everal phy&s;ical Preparations for
clean&s;ing the Body, as they call it, after the Plague,
and needful, as they &s;aid, for &s;uch People to take,
who had been vi&s;ited and had been cur'd; whereas
I mu&s;t own, I believe that it was the Opinion of
the mo&s;t eminent Phy&s;icians at that time, that the
Plague was it&s;elf a &s;ufficient Purge; and that
tho&s;e who e&s;caped the Infection needed no Phy&s;ic
to clean&s;e their Bodies of any other things; the
running Sores, the Tumors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which were broke
and kept open by the Directions of the Phy&s;icians,
having &s;ufficiently clean&s;ed them; and that all
other Di&s;tempers and Cau&s;es of Di&s;tempers were
effectually carried off that Way; and as the Phy|&s;icians
<PB N="278" REF="282">
gave this as their Opinions, wherever they
came, the Quacks got little Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>There were indeed &s;everal little Hurries, which
happen'd after the Decrea&s;e of the Plague, and
which whether they were contriv'd to fright and
di&s;order the People, as &s;ome imagin'd, I cannot
&s;ay, but &s;ometimes we were told the Plague would
return by &s;uch a Time; and the famous <HI>Solomon
Eagle</HI> the naked Quaker, I have mention'd, pro|phe&s;y'd
evil Tidings every Day; and &s;everal others
telling us that <HI>London</HI> had not been &s;ufficiently
&s;courg'd, and the &s;orer and &s;everer Strokes were yet
behind; had they &s;top'd there, or had they de&s;cen|ded
to Particulars, and told us that the City &s;hould
the next Year be de&s;troyed by Fire; then indeed,
when we had &s;een it come to pa&s;s, we &s;hould not
have been to blame to have paid more than a com|mon
Re&s;pect to their Prophetick Spirits, at lea&s;t
we &s;hould have wonder'd at them, and have been
more &s;erious in our Enquiries after the meaning
of it, and whence they had the Fore-knowledge:
But as they generally told us of a Relap&s;e into the
Plague, we have had no Concern &s;ince that about
them; yet by the&s;e frequent Clamours, we were
all kept with &s;ome kind of Apprehen&s;ions con|&s;tantly
upon us, and if any died &s;uddenly, or if the
&s;potted Fevers at any time increa&s;ed, we were pre|&s;ently
alarm'd; much more if the Number of the
Plague encrea&s;ed, for to the End of the Year, there
were always between 2 and 300 of the Plague; on
any of the&s;e Occa&s;ions, I &s;ay, we were alarm'd
anew.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who remember the City of <HI>London</HI> before
the Fire, mu&s;t remember, that there was then no
&s;uch Place as that we now call <HI>Newgate</HI>-Market.
But that in the Middle of the Street, which is now
call'd <HI>Blow-bladder Street,</HI> and which had its Name
from the Butchers, who us'd to kill and dre&s;s their
<PB N="279" REF="283">
Sheep there; (and who it &s;eems had a Cu&s;tom to
blow up their Meat with Pipes to make it look
thicker and fatter than it was, and were puni&s;h'd
there for it by the Lord Mayor) I &s;ay, from the
End of the Street towards <HI>Newgate,</HI> there &s;tood two
long Rows of Shambles for the &s;elling Meat.</P>
<P>It was in tho&s;e Shambles, that two Per&s;ons fal|ling
down dead, as they were buying Meat, gave
Ri&s;e to a Rumor that the Meat was all infected,
which tho' it might affright the People, and &s;poil'd
the Market for two or three Days; yet it appear'd
plainly afterwards, that there was nothing of Truth
in the Sugge&s;tion: But no Body can account for
the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Fear when it takes hold of the
Mind.</P>
<P>However it pleas'd God by the continuing of the
Winter Weather to re&s;tore the Health of the Ci|ty,
that by <HI>February</HI> following, we reckon'd the
Di&s;temper quite ceas'd, and then we were not &s;o
ea&s;ily frighted again.</P>
<P>There was &s;till a Que&s;tion among the Learned, and
at fir&s;t it perplex'd the People a little, and that was,
in what manner to purge the Hou&s;es and Goods,
where the Plague had been; and how to render
them habitable again, which had been left empty
during the time of the Plague; Abundance of Per|fumes
and Preparations were pre&s;crib'd by Phy&s;i|cians,
&s;ome of one kind and &s;ome of another, in
which the People, who li&s;tened to them, put them|&s;elves
to a great, and indeed in my Opinion, to an
unnece&s;&s;ary Expence; and the poorer People, who
only &s;et open their Windows Night and Day, burnt
Brim&s;tone, Pitch, and Gun-powder and &s;uch things
in their Rooms, did as well as the be&s;t; nay, the
eager People, who as I &s;aid above, came Home in
ha&s;t and at all Hazards, found little or no Incon|venience
in their Hou&s;es nor in the Goods, and did
little or nothing to them.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="284">
However, in general, prudent cautious People
did enter into &s;ome Mea&s;ures for airing and &s;weet|ning
their Hou&s;es, and burnt Perfumes, Incen&s;e, Ben|jamin,
Rozin, and Sulphur in the Rooms clo&s;e &s;hut
up, and then let the Air carry it all out with a
Bla&s;t of Gun-powder; others cau&s;ed large Fires to
be made all Day and all Night, for &s;everal Days and
Nights; by the &s;ame Token, that two or three
were pleas'd to &s;et their Hou&s;es on Fire, and &s;o ef|fectually
&s;weetned them by burning them down to
the Ground; as particularly one at <HI>Ratcliff,</HI> one in
<HI>Holbourn,</HI> and one at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> be&s;ides two or
three that were &s;et on Fire, but the Fire was happily
got out again, before it went far enough to burn
down the Hou&s;es; and one Citizen's Servant, I think
it was in <HI>Thames</HI> Street, carryed &s;o much Gun|powder
into his Ma&s;ter's Hou&s;e for clearing it of
the Infection, and managed it &s;o fooli&s;hly, that he
blew up part of the Roof of the Hou&s;e. But the
Time was not fully come, that the City was to
be purg'd by Fire, nor was it far off; for within
Nine Months more I &s;aw it all lying in A&s;hes;
when, as &s;ome of our Quacking Philo&s;ophers pre|tend,
the Seeds of the Plague were entirely de&s;troy'd
and not before; a Notion too ridiculous to &s;peak of
here, &s;ince, had the Seeds of the Plague remain'd
in the Hou&s;es, not to be de&s;troyed but by Fire,
how has it been, that they have not &s;ince broken
out? Seeing all tho&s;e Buildings in the Suburbs and
Liberties, and in the great Pari&s;hes of <HI>Stepney, White-Chapel,
Aldgate, Bi&s;hop&s;gate, Shoreditch, Cripple|gate</HI>
and St. <HI>Giles's,</HI> where the Fire never came, and
where the Plague rag'd with the greate&s;t Violence,
remain &s;till in the &s;ame Condition they were in be|fore.</P>
<P>But to leave the&s;e things ju&s;t as I found them, it
was certain, that tho&s;e People, who were more than
<PB N="281" REF="285">
ordinarily cautious of their Health, did take parti|cular
Directions for what they called Sea&s;oning of
their Hou&s;es, and Abundance of co&s;tly Things were
con&s;um'd on that Account, which, I cannot but &s;ay,
not only &s;ea&s;oned tho&s;e Hou&s;es, as they de&s;ir'd, but
fill'd the Air with very grateful and whole&s;ome
Smells, which others had the Share of the Benefit
of, as well as tho&s;e who were at the Expences of
them.</P>
<P>And yet after all, tho' the Poor came to Town
very precipitantly, as I have &s;aid, yet I mu&s;t lay,
the rich made no &s;uch Ha&s;te; the Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s
indeed came up, but many of them did not bring
their Families to Town, till the Spring came on,
and that they &s;aw Rea&s;on to depend upon it, that
the Plague would not return.</P>
<P>The Court indeed came up &s;oon after Chri&s;tmas,
but the Nobility and Gentry, except &s;uch as de|pended
upon, and had Employment under the Ad|mini&s;tration,
did not come &s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have taken Notice here, that notwith|&s;tanding
the Violence of the Plague in <HI>London</HI> and
in other Places, yet it was very ob&s;ervable, that it
was never on Board the Fleet; and yet for &s;ome
time there was a &s;trange Pre&s;s in the River, and
even in the Streets for Sea-Men to man the Fleet.
But it was in the Beginning of the Year, when the
Plague was &s;carce begun, and not at all come down
to that part of the City, where they u&s;ually pre&s;s
for Seamen; and tho' a War with the <HI>Dutch</HI> was
not at all grateful to the People at that time, and the
Seamen went with a kind of Reluctancy into the
Service, and many complain'd of being drag'd into
it by Force, yet it prov'd in the Event a happy
Violence to &s;everal of them, who had probably
peri&s;h'd in the general Calamity, and who after the
Summer Service was over, tho' they had Cau&s;e to
<PB N="282" REF="286">
lament the De&s;olation of their Families, who, when
they came back, were many of them in their
Graves; yet they had room to be thankful, that
they were carried out of the Reach of it, tho' &s;o
much again&s;t their Wills; we indeed had a hot
War with the <HI>Dutch</HI> that Year, and one very great
Engagement at Sea, in which the <HI>Dutch</HI> were
wor&s;ted; but we lo&s;t a great many Men and &s;ome
Ships. But, as I ob&s;erv'd, the Plague was not in
the Fleet, and when they came to lay up the Ships
in the River, the violent part of it began to abate.</P>
<P>I would be glad, if I could clo&s;e the Account of
this melancholy Year with &s;ome particular Exam|ples
hi&s;torically; I mean of the Thankfulne&s;s to
God our Pre&s;erver for our being delivered from this
dreadful Calamity; certainly the Circum&s;tances of
the Deliverance, as well as the terrible Enemy we
were delivered from, call'd upon the whole Nation
for it; the Circum&s;tances of the Deliverance were
indeed very remarkable, as I have in part mention'd
already, and particularly the dreadful Condition, which
we were all in, when we were, to the Surprize of
the whole Town, made joyful with the Hope of a
Stop of the Infection.</P>
<P>Nothing, but the immediate Finger of God, no|thing,
but omnipotent Power could have done it;
the Contagion de&s;pi&s;ed all Medicine, Death rag'd
in every Corner; and had it gone on as it did
then, a few Weeks more would have clear'd the
Town of all, and every thing that had a Soul: Men
every where began to de&s;pair, every Heart fail'd
them for Fear, People were made de&s;perate thro' the
Angui&s;h of their Souls, and the Terrors of Death
&s;at in the very Faces and Countenances of the
People.</P>
<P>In that very Moment, when we might very well
&s;ay, Vain was the Help of Man; I &s;ay in that very
<PB N="283" REF="287">
Moment it plea&s;ed God, with a mo&s;t agreeable Sur|prize,
to cau&s;e the Fury of it to abate, even of it &s;elf,
and the Malignity declining, as I have &s;aid, tho' in|finite
Numbers were &s;ick, yet fewer died; and the
very fir&s;t Week's Bill decrea&s;ed 1843, a va&s;t Num|ber
indeed!</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Change that ap|pear'd
in the very Countenances of the People, that
<HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Morning, when the Weekly Bill came out; it
might have been perceived in their Countenances, that
a &s;ecret Surprize and Smile of Joy &s;at on every Bodies
Face; they &s;hook one another by the Hands in the
Streets, who would hardly go on the &s;ame Side of the
way with one another before; where the Streets were
not too broad, they would open their Windows and
call from one Hou&s;e to another, and a&s;k'd how
they did, and if they had heard the good News,
that the Plague was abated; Some would return
when they &s;aid good News, and a&s;k, <HI>what good News?</HI>
and when they an&s;wered, that the Plague was abat|ed,
and the Bills decrea&s;ed almo&s;t 2000, they would
cry out, <HI>God be prai&s;ed;</HI> and would weep aloud for
Joy, telling them they had heard nothing of it; and
&s;uch was the Joy of the People that it was as it
were Life to them from the Grave. I could almo&s;t
&s;et down as many extravagant things done in the Ex|ce&s;s
of their Joy, as of their Grief; but that would
be to le&s;&s;en the Value of it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s my &s;elf to have been very much dejec|ted
ju&s;t before this happen'd; for the prodigious Num|ber
that were taken &s;ick the Week or two before,
be&s;ides tho&s;e that died, was &s;uch, and the Lamen|tations
were &s;o great every where, that a Man mu&s;t
have &s;eemed to have acted even again&s;t his Rea&s;on,
if he had &s;o much as expected to e&s;cape; and as
there was hardly a Hou&s;e, but mine, in all my Neigh|bourhood,
but what was infected; &s;o had it gone on,
<PB N="284" REF="288">
it would not have been long, that there would
have been any more Neighbours to be infected;
indeed it is hardly credible, what dreadful Havock
the la&s;t three Weeks had made, for if I might be|lieve
the Per&s;on, who&s;e Calculations I always found
very well grounded, there were not le&s;s than 30000
People dead, and near 100 thou&s;and fallen &s;ick in
the three Weeks I &s;peak of; for the Number that
fickened was &s;urpri&s;ing, indeed it was a&s;toni&s;hing,
and tho&s;e who&s;e Courage upheld them all the time
before, &s;unk under it now.</P>
<P>In the Middle of their Di&s;tre&s;s, when the Con|dition
of the City of <HI>London</HI> was &s;o truly calami|tous,
ju&s;t then it plea&s;ed God, as it were, by his im|mediate
Hand to di&s;arm this Enemy; the Poy&s;on
was taken out of the Sting, it was wonderful, even
the Phy&s;icians them&s;elves were &s;urprized at it;
wherever they vi&s;ited, they found their Patients
better, either they had &s;weated kindly, or the Tu|mours
were broke, or the Carbuncles went down,
and the Inflammations round them chang'd Co|lour,
or the Fever was gone, or the violent Head|ach
was a&s;&s;wag'd, or &s;ome good Symptom was in
the Ca&s;e; &s;o that in a few Days, every Body was
recovering, whole Families that were infected and
down, that had Mini&s;ters praying with them, and
expected Death every Hour, were revived and
healed, and none died at all out of them.</P>
<P>Nor was this by any new Medicine found out,
or new Method of Cure di&s;covered, or by any Ex|perience
in the Operation, which the Phy&s;icians
or Surgeons had attain'd to; but it was evidently
from the &s;ecret invi&s;ible Hand of him, that had at
fir&s;t &s;ent this Di&s;ea&s;e as a Judgment upon us; and
let the Athei&s;tic part of Mankind call my Saying
this what they plea&s;e, it is no Enthu&s;ia&s;m; it was
acknowledg'd at that time by all Mankind; the Di&s;|ea&s;e
<PB N="285" REF="289">
was enervated, and its Malignity &s;pent, and let it
proceed from whence&s;oever it will, let the Philo|&s;ophers
&s;earch for Rea&s;ons in Nature to account for
it by, and labour as much as they will to le&s;&s;en the
Debt they owe to their Maker; tho&s;e Phy&s;icians,
who had the lea&s;t Share of Religion in them, were
oblig'd to acknowledge that it was all &s;upernatural,
that it was extraordinary, and that no Account could
be given of it.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould &s;ay, that this is a vi&s;ible Summons to
us all to Thankfulne&s;s, e&s;pecially we that were un|der
the Terror of its Increa&s;e, perhaps it may be
thought by &s;ome, after the Sen&s;e of the thing was
over, an officious canting of religious things, preach|ing
a Sermon in&s;tead of writing a Hi&s;tory, making
my &s;elf a Teacher in&s;tead of giving my Ob&s;er|vations
of things; and this re&s;trains me very much
from going on here, as I might otherwi&s;e do: But
if ten Leapers were healed, and but one return'd to
give Thanks, I de&s;ire to be as that one, and to be
thankful for my &s;elf.</P>
<P>Nor will I deny, but there were Abundance of
People who to all Appearance were very thankful at
that time; for their Mouths were &s;top'd, even the
Mouths of tho&s;e, who&s;e Hearts were not extraor|dinary
long affected with it: But the Impre&s;&s;ion was
&s;o &s;trong at that time, that it could not be re&s;i&s;ted,
no not by the wor&s;t of the People.</P>
<P>It was a common thing to meet People in the
Street, that were Strangers, and that we knew no|thing
at all of, expre&s;&s;ing their Surprize. Going
one Day thro' <HI>Aldgate,</HI> and a pretty many People
being pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing, there comes a Man
out of the End of the <HI>Minories,</HI> and looking a little
up the Street and down, he throws his Hands
abroad, <HI>Lord, what an Alteration is here!</HI> Why,
la&s;t Week I came along here, and hardly any Body
<PB N="286" REF="290">
was to be &s;een; another Man, I heard him, adds
to his Words, 'tis all wonderful, 'tis all a Dream:
Ble&s;&s;ed be God, &s;ays a third Man, aud let us give
Thanks to him, for 'tis all his own doing: Hu|man
Help and human Skill was at an End. The&s;e
were all Strangers to one another: But &s;uch Salu|tations
as the&s;e were frequent in the Street every
Day; and in Spight of a loo&s;e Behaviour, the very
common People went along the Streets, giving God
Thanks for their Deliverance.</P>
<P>It was now, as I &s;aid before, the People had ca&s;t off
all Apprehen&s;ions, and that too fa&s;t; indeed we were
no more afraid now to pa&s;s by a Man with a white
Cap upon his Head, or with a Cloth wrapt round
his Neck, or with his Leg limping, occa&s;ion'd by
the Sores in his Groyn, all which were frightful
to the la&s;t Degree, but the Week before; but now
the Street was full of them, and the&s;e poor reco|vering
Creatures, give them their Due, appear'd very
&s;en&s;ible of their unexpected Deliverance; and I
&s;hould wrong them very much, if I &s;hould not ac|knowledge,
that I believe many of them were really
thankful; but I mu&s;t own, that for the Generality
of the People it might too ju&s;tly be &s;aid of them,
as was &s;aid of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> after their be|ing
