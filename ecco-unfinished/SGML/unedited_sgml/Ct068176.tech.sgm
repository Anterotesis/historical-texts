<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>NO</HI> Man is qualified to reprove other Mens Faults, but
he that has none of his own, <HI>&s;ay &s;ome People, who
are loth to be told of their Errors;</HI> and 'tis on this Ac|count
only, that the World has the Trouble of a <HI>Preface.</HI></P>
<P>If that be true, the Author freely acknowledges he is the
mo&s;t unqualified Man in the World to reprove.</P>
<P>That no Man is qualified to reprove other Mens Crimes,
who allows him&s;elf in the Practice of the &s;ame, is very rea|dity
granted, and is the very Sub&s;tance and Foundation of
the following <HI>Satyr:</HI> And on that &s;core, the Author has as
good a Title to Animadver&s;ion as another, &s;ince no Man can
charge him with any of the Vices he has reprov'd.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead of Self-defence, he is rather willing to
look back on the be&s;t Actions of his Life, with the Temper
of a Penitent, and he wi&s;hes all Men won'd do the like; 'tis
the onely way to make the <HI>Satyr</HI> Impertiment.</P>
<Q><L>For Penitence would all his Ver&s;e di&s;arm,</L>
<L>The <HI>Satyr</HI>'s an&s;wer'd if the Men reform.</L></Q>
<P>But the Fact is not true neither: 'Tis a pr$ity way for
Men to get rid of the Impertinence of Admonition. If none
but faultle&s;s Men mu&s;t reprove others, the Lord h$ Mercy
upon all our Magi&s;trates; and all our Clergy are undigni|fied
and &s;u&s;pended at a Blow.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
Nor does the <HI>Satyr</HI> a&s;&s;ault private Infirmity, or pur&s;ue
Per&s;onal Vices; but is bent at tho&s;e, who pretending to &s;up|pre&s;s
Vice, or being ve&s;ted with Authority for that purpo&s;e,
yet make them&s;elves the Shame of their Country, encouraging
Wic$$dne&s;s by that very Authority they have to &s;uppre&s;s it.</P>
<P>He profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf &s;orry, either that Freedom of Speech
is &s;o dangerous in this Age, or that he is too much a Cow|ard
otherwi&s;e, &s;ome had heard of their Crimes who think
them&s;elves above the Power of Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>'Tis hard that Vice &s;hould have &s;o much &s;helter from Ci|vil
Power, that Reproof &s;hould lead the Party to &s;uppre&s;s the
Poet rather than the Crime.</P>
<P>And yet his Friends give him over for lo&s;t: An Account
of what he has ventur'd to &s;ay, to who&s;e Importunity he thinks
him&s;elf oblig'd to an&s;wer with <HI>Juvenal,</HI>
<Q><L>Difficile e&s;t Satyram non &s;cribere. Nam quis Iniquae.</L>
<L>Tam Patiens Urbis, tam ferreus ut teneat &s;e?</L></Q></P>
<P>If any Man is injur'd by the Characters, he is content
they &s;hould carry their Re&s;entment to what Extremity they
plea&s;e; but if Truth may be on his &s;ide, the only way to make
him do them Ju&s;tice is to reform: And he promi&s;es to give
Te&s;timony to their Repentance, <HI>as an Amand Honourable,</HI>
in a manner as publick as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
