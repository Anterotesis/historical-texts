<HEAD>PREFACE TO Mr. <HI>POPE</HI>.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_ABOUT two Years ago, upon a &s;light Mi&s;|apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions of yours, which my Re&s;entment, or perhaps my Pride, interpreted to the Di&s;advantage of a Poetical Trifle, I had then newly publi&s;h'd, I &s;uffer'd my&s;elf to be unrea&s;onably tran&s;ported, &s;o far, as to in&s;cribe you an angry, and incon|&s;iderate Preface; without previous Examina|tion into the Ju&s;tne&s;s of my Proceeding. I have lately had the Mortification to learn from your own Hand, that you were en|tirely guiltle&s;s of the Fact charg'd upon you; &s;o that, in attempt|ing to retaliate a &s;uppos'd Injury, I have done a real Inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The only Thing which an hone&s;t Man ought to be more a&s;ham'd of than his Faults, is a Reluctance again&s;t confe&s;&s;ing them. I have already acknowledg'd mine to your&s;elf: But no publick Guilt is well aton'd, by a private Satisfaction; I there|fore &s;end you a Duplicate of my Letter, by way of the World, that all, who remember my Offence, may al&s;o witne&s;s my Re|pentance.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>_I</HI> AM under the greate&s;t Confu&s;ion I ever felt in my Life, to find by your Letter, that I have been guilty of a Crime, which I can never forgive <HI>My&s;elf,</HI> were it for no other Rea&s;on, than that <HI>You</HI> have forgiven it. I might have learnt from your Writings the Extent of your Soul, and &s;hou'd have concluded it impo&s;&s;ible for the Author of tho&s;e elevated Sentiments, to &s;ink beneath them in his Practice.</P>
<P>You are generou&s;ly moderate, when you mitigate my Guilt, and mi&s;|call it a <HI>Credulity;</HI> 'twas a pa&s;&s;ionate, and mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable <HI>Levity,</HI> and mu&s;t &s;till have remain'd unpardonable, whatever Truth might have been found in its mi&s;taken Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>What &s;tings me mo&s;t, in my Reflection on this Folly, is, that I know not how to <HI>atone</HI> it; I will endeavour it, however; being always a&s;ham'd, when I have attempted to revenge an Injury, but never more proud, than when I have begg'd Pardon for an Error.</P>
<P>If you needed an Inducement to the &s;trengthening your Forgivene&s;s, you might gather it from the&s;e two Con&s;iderations; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Crime was almo&s;t a Sin again&s;t Conviction; for though not happy enough to know you per&s;onally, your <HI>Mind</HI> had been my intimate Acquaintance, and regarded with a kind of partial Tenderne&s;s, that made it little le&s;s than Miracle, that I attempted to offend you. A &s;udden Warmth, to which, by Nature, I am much too liable, tran&s;ported me to a Condition, I &s;hall be&s;t de&s;cribe in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Sen&s;e, &s;omewhere or other.</P>
<Q><L>Blind in th' ob&s;curing Mi&s;t of heedle&s;s Rage,</L>
<L>I've ra&s;hly &s;hot my Arrows o'er a Hou&s;e,</L>
<L>And hurt my Brother.&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>A <HI>Second</HI> Con&s;ideration is, the Occa&s;ion you have gather'd to puni&s;h my Inju&s;tice, with more than double Sharpne&s;s, by your Manner of receiving it. The Armour of your Mind is temper'd &s;o <HI>divinely,</HI> that my mere <HI>Human</HI> Weapons have not only fail'd to pierce, but broke to pieces in rebounding. You meet A&s;&s;aults, like &s;ome expert <HI>Arabian,</HI> who, declining any U&s;e of his own Javelin, arre&s;ts tho&s;e which come again&s;t him, in the Fiercene&s;s of their Motion, and overcomes his Ene|mies, by detaining their own Weapons. 'Tis a noble Triumph you now exerci&s;e, by the Superiority of your Nature; and while I &s;ee you looking down upon the Di&s;tance of my Frailty, I am forc'd to <HI>own</HI> a Glory, which I <HI>envy</HI> you; and am quite a&s;ham'd of the poor Figure I am making, in the bottom of the Pro&s;pect. I <HI>feel,</HI> I am &s;ure, Re|mor&s;e,
<PB N="v" REF="4">
enough to &s;atisfy you for the Wrong, but to <HI>expre&s;s</HI> it, wou'd, I think, exceed even <HI>your own</HI> Power.</P>
<Q><L>Yours, who&s;e &s;weet Songs can rival <HI>Orpheu</HI>'s Strain,</L>
<L>And force the wondring Woods to dance again,</L>
<L>Make moving Mountains hear your pow'rful Call,</L>
<L>And headlong Streams hang li&s;t'ning in their Fall.</L></Q>
<P>No Words can be worthy to come after the&s;e; I will therefore ha&s;ten to tell you, that I am, and will ever be, with the greate&s;t Truth and Re&s;pect,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE><HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE>
<SIGNED><HI>Your Mo&s;t Humble, and Mo&s;t Obedient Servant,</HI> A. HILL.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>I have now attempted, as far as I am able, to throw off a Weight, which my Mind has been unea&s;y under. I cannot &s;ay, in the City Phra&s;e, that I have <HI>balanc'd the Account</HI>, but you mu&s;t admit of Compo&s;ition, where full Payment is impo&s;&s;ible. I &s;hall be &s;o far from regretting you the old Benefit of <HI>Lex tali|onis</HI>, that I forgive you heartily, beforehand, for any thing you may hereafter think fit to &s;ay, or do, to my Di&s;advantage; nay, the Plea&s;ure I enjoy by reflecting on your good Nature, will de|generate to a <HI>Pain</HI>, if one Accident or other, in the Cour&s;e of your Life, does not favour me with &s;ome Occa&s;ion of advancing your Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much to you, in your Quality of a <HI>Good Man</HI>, I will proceed to addre&s;s you, in your other Quality, of a <HI>Great Poet</HI>; in which Light I look up to you with extraordinary Com|fort, as to a new Con&s;tellation breaking out upon our World, with equal Heat, and Brightne&s;s, and cro&s;s-&s;pangling, as it were, the whole Heaven of Wit with your milky way of Genius.</P>
<P>You cou'd never have been born at a Time, which more want|ed the Influence of your Example: All the Fire you bring with you, and the Judgment you are acquiring, in the Cour&s;e of your Journey, will be put to their full Stre&s;s, to &s;upport and rebuild the &s;inking Honours of Poetry.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">It was a Cu&s;tom, which prevail'd generally among the Anci|ents, to impute Cele&s;tial De&s;cent to their Heroes; The Vanity, methinks, might have been pardonable, and rational, if apply'd to an Art; &s;ince Arts, when they are at once delightful and pro|fitable, as you will certainly leave <HI>Poetry</HI>, have one real Mark of <HI>Divinity</HI>, they become, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, <HI>immortal</HI>. And as the olde&s;t, and, I think, the &s;ublime&s;t Poem in the World, is of <HI>He|brew</HI> Original, and was made immediately after pa&s;&s;ing the Red-Sea, at a Time, when the Author had neither Lei&s;ure, nor Po&s;&s;ibility, to invent a new Art: It mu&s;t therefore be undeniable, either that the <HI>Hebrews</HI> brought Poetry out of <HI>Egypt</HI>, or that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> receiv'd it from God, by immediate <HI>In&s;piration</HI>. This la&s;t, being what a Poet &s;hould be fonde&s;t of believing, I wou'd fain &s;uppo&s;e it probable, that God, who was pleas'd to in&s;truct <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> with what Ceremony he wou'd be wor&s;hip'd, taught him al&s;o a Mode of Thinking, and expre&s;&s;ing Thought, unprophan'd by vulgar U&s;e, and peculiar to that Wor&s;hip. God then taught Poetry fir&s;t to the <HI>Hebrews</HI>, and the <HI>Hebrews</HI> to Mankind in ge|neral.</P>
<P>But, however this may have been, there is, apparently, a di|vine Spirit, glowing forcibly in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Poetry, a kind of terrible Simplicity! a magnificent Plainne&s;s! which is commonly lo&s;t, in Paraphra&s;e, by our mi&s;taken Endeavours after heighten|ing the Sentiments, by a figurative Expre&s;&s;ion; This is very ill judg'd: The little Ornaments of Rhetorick might &s;erve, fortu|nately enough, to &s;well out the Leanne&s;s of &s;ome <HI>modern</HI> Com|po&s;itions; but to &s;hadow over the Lu&s;tre of a divine <HI>Hebrew</HI> Thought, by an Affectation of <HI>enliv'ning</HI> it, is to <HI>paint</HI> upon a <HI>Diamond</HI>, and call it an <HI>Ornament</HI>.</P>
<P>It is a &s;urprizing Reflection, that the&s;e noble <HI>Hebrew</HI> Poets &s;hou'd have written with &s;uch admirable Vigour three Thou&s;and Years ago; and that, in&s;tead of improving, we &s;hou'd affect to de&s;pi&s;e them; as if, to write <HI>&s;moothly</HI>, and without the Spirit of <HI>Imagery</HI>, were the true Art of Poetry, becau&s;e the only Art we practi&s;e. It puts me in Mind of the famous <HI>Roman</HI> Lady, who &s;uppos'd, that Men had, <HI>naturally</HI>, &s;tinking Breaths, becau&s;e &s;he had been us'd to it, in her Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t obvious Defect in our Poetry, and I think the great|e&s;t it is liable to, is, that we &s;tudy <HI>Form</HI>, and neglect <HI>Matter</HI>. We are often very flowing, and under a full Sail of Words, while we leave our Sen&s;e fa&s;t aground, as too <HI>weighty</HI> to float on <HI>Frothine&s;s</HI>; We run on, upon fal&s;e Scents, like a Spaniel, that &s;tarts away at Random after a Stone, which is kept back in the Hand, though it &s;eem'd to fly before him. To &s;peak with Freedom on this
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
Subject, is a Ta&s;k of more Danger than Honour; for few Minds have real Greatne&s;s enough to con&s;ider a Detection of their Er|rors, as a Warning to their Conduct, and an Advantage to their Fame; But no di&s;cerning Judgment will con&s;ider it as ill Nature, in one Writer, to mark the Faults of another. A general Prac|tice of that Kind wou'd be the highe&s;t Service to Poetry. No Di&s;ea&s;e can be cur'd, till its Nature is examin'd; and the fir&s;t likely Step towards correcting our Errors, is re&s;olving to learn impartially, that we have Errors to be corrected.</P>
<P>I will therefore, with much Freedom, but no manner of Ma|lice, remark an In&s;tance or two, from no mean Writers, to prove, that our Poetry has been degenerating apace into mere <HI>Sound</HI>, or <HI>Harmony</HI>; nor ought This to be con&s;ider'd as an invidious At|tempt, &s;ince whatever Pains we take, about poli&s;hing our <HI>Num|bers</HI>, where we rai&s;e not our <HI>Meaning</HI>, are as impertinently be|&s;towed, as the Labour wou'd be, of &s;etting a broken Leg after the Soul has left the Body. The Gunners have a Cu&s;tom, when a Ball is too little for the Bore of their Canon, to wrap <HI>Towe</HI> about it, till it fills the Mouth of the Piece; after which, it is di&s;charg'd, with a Thunder, proportionable to the Size of the Gun; But its Execution at the Mark, will immediately di&s;cover, that the Noi&s;e of the Di&s;charge was a great deal too big for the Diameter of the Bullet. It is ju&s;t the &s;ame thing with an un|&s;inewy Imagination, &s;ent abroad in &s;ounding Numbers; The Lof|tine&s;s of the Expre&s;&s;ion will a&s;toni&s;h &s;hallow Readers into a tem|porary Admiration, and &s;upport it, for a while; but the Bounce, however loud, goes no farther than the <HI>Ear</HI>; The <HI>Heart</HI> remains unreach'd by the Languor of the Sentiment.</P>
<P>Poetry, the mo&s;t elevated Exertion of human Wit, is no more than a weak and contemptible Amu&s;ement, wanting Energy of Thought, or Propriety of Expre&s;&s;ion. Yet we may run into Er|ror, by an injudicious Affectation of attaining Perfection, as Men, who are gazing upward, when they &s;hou'd be looking to their Foot&s;teps, &s;tumble frequently again&s;t Po&s;ts, while they have the Sun in Contemplation.</P>
<P>In attempting, for Example, to modernize &s;o lofty an Ode as the 104th <HI>P&s;alm</HI>, the Choice of Metaphors &s;hou'd, methinks, have been con&s;idered, as one of the mo&s;t remarkable Difficulties. There &s;eems to have been a Nece&s;&s;ity, that they &s;hou'd be noble, as well as natural; and yet, if too much <HI>rais'd</HI>, they wou'd en|danger an <HI>Extinction</HI> of the Charms, which they were de&s;ign'd to <HI>illu&s;trate</HI>. That powerful Imagination of <HI>the Sea, climbing over the Mountains Tops, and ru&s;hing back, upon the Plains, at the Voice of God's Thunder</HI>, ought certainly to have been expre&s;s'd with as
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
much <HI>Plainne&s;s</HI> as po&s;&s;ible: And, to demon&s;trate how ill the con|trary Mea&s;ure has &s;ucceeded, one need only ob&s;erve how it looks in Mr. <HI>Trapp</HI>'s Metaphorical Refinement.</P>
<Q><L>"The <HI>Ebbing</HI> Deluge did its <HI>Troops</HI> recal,</L>
<L>"<HI>Drew off</HI> its <HI>Forces,</HI> and di&s;clos'd the Ball,</L>
<L>"They, at th' Eternal's <HI>Signal march'd</HI> away.</L></Q>
<P>Who does not di&s;cern, in this Place, what an Injury is done to the original Image, by the military Metaphor? Recalling the <HI>Troops</HI> of a Deluge, <HI>Drawing off</HI> its <HI>Forces</HI>; and its <HI>Marching</HI> away, at a <HI>Signal</HI>, carry not only a vi&s;ible Impropriety of Thought, but are infinitely below the Maje&s;ty of That God, who is &s;o dreadfully repre&s;ented thundering his Commands to the Ocean; They are directly the Rever&s;e of that terrible Confu&s;ion, and overwhelming Uproar of Motion, which the Sea, in the Origi|nal, is &s;uppos'd to fall into. The March of an Army is <HI>plea&s;ing, orderly, &s;low</HI>; The Inundation of a Sea, from the Tops of the Mountains, <HI>frightful, wild</HI> and <HI>tumultuous</HI>; Every Ju&s;tne&s;s and Grace of the original Conception is de&s;troyed by the Metaphor.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame <HI>P&s;alm</HI>, the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Poet de&s;cribing God, &s;ays, &mdash;<HI>He maketh the Clouds his Chariots, and walketh on the Wings of the Wind</HI>. Making the <HI>Clouds</HI> his <HI>Chariots</HI>, is a &s;trong and lively Thought; But That of <HI>walking on the Wings of the Wind</HI>, is a Sublimity, that <HI>frightens, a&s;toni&s;hes</HI>, and <HI>ravi&s;hes</HI> the Mind of a Reader, who conceives it, as he &s;hou'd do. The Judgment of the Poet in this Place, is di&s;cernable in three different Particu|lars; The Thought is in it&s;elf highly noble, and elevated; To move at all upon the Wind, carries with it an Image of much Maje&s;ty and Terror; But this natural Grandeur he fir&s;t encreas'd by the Word <HI>Wings</HI>, which repre&s;ents the Motion, as not only on the <HI>Winds</HI>, but on the Winds in their utmo&s;t <HI>Violence</HI>, and <HI>Rapidity</HI> of <HI>Agitation</HI>. But then at la&s;t, comes that fini&s;hing Sublimity, which attends the Word <HI>walks!</HI> The Poet is not &s;ati&s;|fied to repre&s;ent God, as <HI>riding</HI> on the Winds; nor even as riding on them in a <HI>Tempe&s;t</HI>; He therefore tells us, that He <HI>walks</HI> on their <HI>Wings</HI>; that &s;o our Idea might be heighten'd to the utmo&s;t, by reflecting on this <HI>calm</HI>, and <HI>ea&s;y</HI> Motion of the Deity, upon a Violence, &s;o <HI>rapid</HI>, &s;o <HI>furious</HI>, and <HI>ungovernable</HI>, to our human Conception. Yet as nothing can be more <HI>&s;ublime</HI>, &s;o nothing can be more <HI>&s;imple</HI>, and plain, than this noble Imagination. But Mr. <HI>Trapp</HI>, not contented to <HI>expre&s;s</HI>, attempts unhappily to <HI>adorn</HI> this inimitable Beauty, in the following Manner.</P>
<Q><PB N="ix" REF="8">
<L>"Who, borne in Triumph o'er the Heavenly <HI>Plains,</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>Rides</HI> on the <HI>Clouds,</HI> and holds a Storm in <HI>Reins,</HI></L>
<L>"<HI>Flies</HI> on the <HI>Wings</HI> of the &s;onorous <HI>Wind,</HI> &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>Here his imperfect, and dimini&s;hing Metaphor, of the <HI>Reins</HI>, has quite ruin'd the Image; What rational, much le&s;s noble Idea, can any Man conceive of a Wind in a Bridle? The unlucky Word <HI>Plains</HI> too, is a downright Contradiction to the Meaning of the Pa&s;&s;age. What wider Difference in Nature, than between driv|ing a Chariot over a Plain, and moving enthron'd, amid&s;t That rolling, and terrible Perplexity of Motions, which we figure to our Imagination, from a <HI>Chariot</HI> of <HI>Clouds?</HI> But the mi&s;taken Embelli&s;hment of the Word <HI>flies</HI>, in the la&s;t Ver&s;e, is an Error almo&s;t unpardonable; In&s;tead of improving the Conception, it has made it trifling, and contemptible, and utterly de&s;troy'd the very Soul of its Energy! <HI>flies</HI> on the Wind! What an Image is That, to expre&s;s the Maje&s;ty of God? To <HI>walk</HI> on the Wind is a&s;toni&s;hing, and horrible; But to <HI>fly</HI> on the Wind, is the Em|ployment of a <HI>Bat</HI>, of an <HI>Owl</HI>, of a <HI>Feather!</HI> Mr. <HI>Trapp</HI> is, I believe, a Gentleman of &s;o much Candour, and &s;o true a Friend to the Intere&s;t of the Art he <HI>profe&s;&s;es</HI>, that there will be no Oc|ca&s;ion to a&s;k his Pardon, for dragging a Criminal Metaphor, or two, out of the Immunity of his Protection.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Philips</HI> has lately been told in Print, by one of our be&s;t Criticks, that he has excell'd all the Ancients, in his Pa&s;toral Writings; He will, therefore, be apt to wonder, that I take the Liberty to &s;ay, in downright Re&s;pect to Truth, and the Ju&s;tice due to Poetry, that I have not only &s;een modern Pa&s;torals, much better than <HI>His</HI>, but that his appear, to me, neither <HI>natural</HI>, nor <HI>equal</HI>. One might extend this Remark to the very Names of his Shepherds; <HI>Lobbin, Hobbinol</HI>, and <HI>Cuddy</HI> are nothing of a Piece, with <HI>Lanquet, Mico</HI>, and <HI>Argol</HI>; nor do his Per&s;onages agree bet|ter with them&s;elves, than their <HI>Names</HI> with one another. <HI>Mico</HI>, for Example, at the fir&s;t Sight we have of him, is a very polite Speaker, and as metaphorical as Mr. <HI>Trapp</HI>.</P>
<Q><L>"This Place may &s;eem for Shepherds Lei&s;ure made,</L>
<L>"So <HI>lovingly</HI> the&s;e Elms <HI>unite their Shade!</HI></L>
<L>"Th' <HI>ambitious Woodbine!</HI> how it <HI>climbs, to breathe</HI></L>
<L>"Its <HI>balmy Sweets</HI> around, on all beneath!</L></Q>
<P>But, alas! this Fit of Eloquence, like mo&s;t other Ble&s;&s;ings, is of very &s;hort Continuance; It holds him but ju&s;t one Speech: In
<PB N="x" REF="9">
the beginning of the next, he is as very a Ru&s;tick, as <HI>Colin Clout</HI>, and has forgot all his Breeding.</P>
<Q><L>"No Skill of Mu&s;ick can I, &s;imple Swain,</L>
<L>"No fine Device, <HI>thine Ear</HI> to entertain;</L>
<L>"Albeit <HI>&s;ome deal</HI> I pipe, <HI>rude</HI> though it <HI>be,</HI></L>
<L>"Sufficient to <HI>divert</HI> my <HI>Sheep,</HI> and <HI>Me</HI>.</L></Q>
<P>There is no Transformation in <HI>Ovid</HI> more &s;udden, or &s;urpriz|ing; He has Rea&s;on indeed to &s;ay, that, when he <HI>pipes &s;ome deal</HI>, his <HI>Sheep</HI> are <HI>diverted</HI> with him. His <HI>Readers</HI>, I am afraid too, are as merry as his <HI>Sheep</HI>; If he was but as &s;kilful in Change of <HI>Tune</HI>, as he is in Change of <HI>Dialect</HI>, commend me to him for a Mu&s;ician! The pied Piper, who drew all the Rats of a City out, after his Melody, came not near him for Variety.</P>
<P>If the late excellent Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>, who&s;e Ver&s;es abound in Graces, which can never be too much admir'd, &s;hall be, often, found liable to an Overflow of his Meaning, by this Drop&s;ical Wordine&s;s, which we &s;o generally give into, it will &s;erve at the &s;ame time, as a Comfort, and a Warning; and incline us to a &s;evere Examination of our Writings, when we venture out upon a World, that will, one time or other, be &s;ure to cen&s;ure us im|partially; In That Gentleman's Works, whoever looks clo&s;e, will di&s;cover <HI>Thorns</HI> on every Branch of his <HI>Ro&s;es</HI>; For Example, we all hear, with Delight, in his celebrated Letter from <HI>Italy</HI>, that, there,
<Q><L>&mdash;The Mu&s;e &s;o <HI>oft</HI> her Harp has &s;trung,</L>
<L>That not a Mountain rears its Head un&s;ung.</L></Q></P>
<P>But he adds, in the very next Line, that every &s;hady <HI>Thicket</HI> too, grows renown'd in Ver&s;e; now one can never help remem|bring, that <HI>Thickets</HI> are Births, as it were of Ye&s;terday; the mere <HI>Infancy</HI> of <HI>Woods!</HI> and that the <HI>olde&s;t Woods</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> may be grow|ing on Foundations of ruin'd Cities, which flouri&s;h'd in the Times he there &s;peaks of; whence it mu&s;t naturally be inferr'd, that to &s;ay, the <HI>Italian Thickets</HI> grow renown'd in <HI>Roman Ver&s;e</HI>, though the <HI>Mountains</HI> really do &s;o, is to make U&s;e of <HI>Words</HI>, without Regard to their Meaning; A Lap&s;e of dangerous Con|&s;equence, becau&s;e, when the Under&s;tanding is once &s;hock'd, this mo&s;t rapturous Elevation of the Mind (as when <HI>cold</HI> Water is thrown &s;uddenly upon <HI>boiling</HI>) &s;inks at once to chilling Flatne&s;s, and is con&s;idered as mere Gingle and childi&s;h Amu&s;ement.</P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="10">No Man, I believe, has read without Plea&s;ure, his fine and lively De&s;criptions of the <HI>Nar, Clitumnus, Mincio</HI>, and <HI>Albula</HI>, but the wor&s;t of it is, he winds us &s;o long, in and out, between the&s;e Rivers, that he lo&s;es him&s;elf in their Maeanders, and brings us, at la&s;t, to a &s;trange Stream indeed, which is <HI>immortaliz'd in Song</HI>, and yet <HI>lo&s;t in Oblivion</HI>.</P>
<Q><L>"I look for Streams, <HI>immortaliz'd,</HI> in Song,</L>

<P>The <HI>Thought</HI>, in this Place, is very lively, and ju&s;t, but quite ob&s;cur'd by the Redundancy and Wantonne&s;s of the Expre&s;&s;ion. Had he only &s;aid <HI>lo&s;t</HI>, and <HI>buried</HI>, it might have been urg'd, that the Rivers were dry'd up, and no longer to be found, in their old Channels. But, let them be lo&s;t, as to <HI>Exi&s;tence</HI>, as certain|ly as he will, they can never be lo&s;t in <HI>Oblivion</HI>, if they are <HI>im|mortaliz'd</HI> in Poetry. <HI>Immortal</HI> is a favourite Word in this Gen|tleman's Writings and leads him, as mo&s;t Favourites are apt to do, into very frequent Errors.</P>
<P>It is naturally unplea&s;ant, to be detain'd too long in the Mazi|ne&s;s of one tedious Thought, expre&s;s'd many Ways &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. When we read that the <HI>Tiber is de&s;titute of Strength</HI>, what el&s;e can we conclude, but that its Stream is a weak one? But we are oblig'd to hear, al&s;o, that it <HI>derives its Source from an unthrifty Urn:</HI> Well, <HI>now</HI>, may we go on? No; its <HI>Urn</HI> is not only <HI>unthrifty</HI>, but its <HI>Source</HI> is <HI>unfruitful</HI>. By this time, one can &s;carce help enquiring, what <HI>new Meaning</HI> is convey'd to the Apprehen&s;ion, by the Mul|tiplication of the Phra&s;es? And not finding <HI>any</HI>, we have no Re|flection to &s;atisfy our&s;elves with, but, that the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t</HI> Flow of Fancy, is mo&s;t &s;ubject to <HI>Whirlpools</HI>.</P>
<P>It is from the &s;ame unweigh'd Redundancy, and Mi&s;applica|tion of Words, that we &s;o often find this excellent Writer falling into the <HI>Anticlimax</HI>. As where, for Example, he informs us of <HI>Liberty</HI>, that &s;he is a Godde&s;s,
<Q><L>"<HI>Profu&s;e</HI> of <HI>Bli&s;s,</HI> and <HI>pregnant</HI> with <HI>Delight,</HI></L>
<L>"Eternal <HI>Plea&s;ures,</HI> in her Pre&s;ence reign.</L></Q></P>
<P>After <HI>Profu&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Bli&s;s</HI>, that is to &s;ay, the heap'd Enjoyment of all Ble&s;&s;ings to be wi&s;h'd for; how does it <HI>cool</HI> the Imagination, to read of being <HI>pregnant</HI> with <HI>Delight?</HI> Had &s;he been <HI>brought to Bed of Delight</HI>, it had been but a poor Delivery: For what im|ports <HI>Delight</HI>, in Compari&s;on with <HI>Bli&s;s?</HI> And how much le&s;s too is <HI>pregnant</HI> with <HI>Delight</HI>, than <HI>Delight</HI> in <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion!</HI> But then
<PB N="xii" REF="11">
again, after both the&s;e, what cou'd the Author hope to teach us, by adding, that <HI>Plea&s;ure reigns in her Pre&s;ence</HI>. Can there be <HI>Bli&s;s</HI> without <HI>Delight?</HI> Was there ever <HI>Delight</HI> without <HI>Plea&s;ure?</HI> It &s;hou'd gradually have a&s;cended thus, <HI>Plea&s;ure, Delight, Bli&s;s</HI>; But to turn it the direct contrary Way, <HI>Bli&s;s, Delight, Plea&s;ure</HI>, is &s;etting a poor Meaning upon its Head, and the &s;ame thing as to &s;ay, Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> writ <HI>incomparably, finely</HI>, nay, and <HI>tolerably</HI>. A Prai&s;e, which, I dare &s;ay, he wou'd have given no Body Thanks for. One wou'd think there were a kind of Fatality in <HI>Liberty</HI>, &s;ince &s;carce any Body can meddle either with the Word or the Thing, but they turn all top&s;ey turvey.</P>
<P>But I am &s;liding in&s;en&s;ibly into a Theme, that requires rather a Volume, than a Page or two; I ha&s;ten therefore to pre&s;ent you a Paraphra&s;e on the Six Days Work of the Creator, as de&s;cribed to us by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>, in the Fir&s;t Chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI>, which, you know, was written, originally, in Ver&s;e. It wou'd be difficult, I am &s;ure, to match the Greatne&s;s of that in&s;pired Author's Images, out of all the noble Writings, which have honour'd Antiquity; and who&s;e mo&s;t remarkable Excellencies have been found, in tho&s;e Parts of their Works, which they elevated, and made more &s;olemn, by a Mixture of their <HI>Religion</HI>. Our Poetry, in &s;o able a Hand as <HI>Yours</HI>, might receive heavenly Advantages, from a Practice of like Nature. But I am of Opinion, that no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ver&s;e, except that, which we, I think a little improperly, call <HI>Pindaric</HI>, can allow the nece&s;&s;ary Scope, to &s;o ma&s;terle&s;s a Sub|ject, as the <HI>Creation</HI>, of all others the mo&s;t copious, and illu&s;tri|ous; and which ought to be touch'd with mo&s;t Di&s;cretion, and Choice of Circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Milton</HI>, Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI>, Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore</HI>, and now, late|ly, a young Gentleman, of a very lively Genius, have &s;everally tried their Strength in this cele&s;tial Bow; Sir <HI>Richard</HI> may be &s;aid indeed to have &s;hot <HI>farthe&s;t</HI>, but too often be&s;ide the Mark; He Will permit me the Liberty of owning my Opinion, that he is too minute, and particular, and rather labours to oppre&s;s us with every Image he cou'd rai&s;e, than to refre&s;h and enliven us, with the noble&s;t, and mo&s;t differing. He is al&s;o too unmindful of the Dignity of his Subject, and dimini&s;hes it by mean, and contemp|tible Metaphors. Speaking of the Skies, he &s;ays they were

<P>The&s;e animated Images, or pictured Meanings of Poetry, are the forcible In&s;pirers, which enflame a Reader's Will, and bind down his Attention. They ari&s;e from <HI>living Words</HI>, as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> calls them; that is, from Words &s;o finely cho&s;en, and &s;o ju&s;tly ranged, that they call up before a Reader the Spirit of their Sen&s;e, in that very Form, and Action, it impre&s;&s;ed upon the Writer. But when the Idea, which a Poet &s;trives to rai&s;e, is in it&s;elf mag|nificent and &s;triking, the Dawb of Metaphor, or any &s;pumy Colourings of Rhetoric can but deaden, and efface it.</P>
<P>If Sir <HI>Richard</HI> had &s;aid, concerning the Skies, on any other Subject but This, of the <HI>Creation</HI>, that they were <HI>&s;pun thin, and wove, on Nature's fine&s;t Loom</HI>, the Thought had been &s;o far from Impropriety, as to have been plea&s;ing, and prai&s;e-worthy; But when the Image he wou'd &s;et before us, is the Maker of Heaven and Earth, in all the dreadful Maje&s;ty of his Omnipotence, pro|ducing at a Word, the noble&s;t Part of the Creation, and <HI>&s;pread|ing out the Heavens as a Curtain</HI>; In this tremendous Exerci&s;e of his Divinity, to compare him to a <HI>Weaver</HI>, and his Expan&s;ion of the Skies, to the low Mechani&s;m of a <HI>Loom</HI>, is injudiciou&s;ly to <HI>di|mini&s;h</HI> an Idea, he pretends to <HI>heighten</HI> and <HI>illu&s;trate</HI>.</P>
<P>I will end with a Word or two concerning the different Mea&s;ure of the Ver&s;e, in which the following Poem is written; and which is apt to di&s;gu&s;t Readers not well grounded in Poetry, becau&s;e it requires a fuller Degree of Attention than the Couplet, and, as Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI> has &s;aid of it,
<Q><L>&mdash;Will no <HI>un&s;kilful Touch</HI> endure,</L>
<L>But flings <HI>Writer</HI> and <HI>Reader</HI> too, that &s;its not &s;ure.</L></Q></P>
<P>I have, in another Place, endeavoured by Arguments to de|mon&s;trate the Preference of this Kind of Ver&s;e to any other; I
<PB N="xiv" REF="13">
will here ob&s;erve only, from my Experience of other Writers, that it wins, in&s;inuates, and grows in&s;en&s;ibly upon the Reli&s;h of a Reader, till the little &s;eeming Har&s;hne&s;s, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be in it, &s;oftens gradually away, and leaves a vigorous Impre&s;&s;ion behind it, of mixed Maje&s;ty and Sweetne&s;s.</P>
<P>A Man, who is ju&s;t beginning to try his Ear in <HI>Pindaric</HI>, may be compared to a new <HI>Scater</HI>; He totters &s;trangely at fir&s;t, and &s;taggers backward and forward; Every Stick, or frozen Stone in his Way, is a Rub that he falls at. But when many repeated Trials have embolden'd him to &s;trike out, and taught the true Poize of Motion, he throws forward his Body with a dextrous Velocity, and becoming ravi&s;h'd with the ma&s;terly Sweep of his Windings, knows no Plea&s;ure greater, than to feel him&s;elf fly through that well-mea&s;ured Mazine&s;s, which he fir&s;t attempted with Perplexity. But I will detain you no longer, and ha&s;ten now to the Poem, which has given me this plea&s;ing Opportunity of telling you how much I am,</P>
