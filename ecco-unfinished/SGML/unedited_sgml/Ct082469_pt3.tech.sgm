<P>THE parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XVII.</NOTE> which was $$$moned &s;oon
after the King's acce&s;&s;ion, was both elected
and a&s;&s;embled in tranquillity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1377.</NOTE> and the great
$$$nge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government during the minority.</NOTE> from a &s;overeign of con&s;ummate wi&s;dom and
experience, to a boy of eleven years of age, was not
immediately felt by the people. The habits of order
and obedience, which the barons had been taught during
the long reign of Edward, &s;till influenced them; and
<PB N="2" REF="8">
the authority of the King's three uncles, the dukes of
Lanca&s;ter, York, and Gloce&s;ter, &s;ufficed to repre&s;s, for
a time, the turbulent &s;pirit, to which that order, in a
weak reign, was &s;o often &s;ubject. The dangerous am|bition
too of the&s;e princes them&s;elves was checked, by
the plain and undeniable title of Richard, by the decla|ration
of it made by his grandfather in parliament, and
by the affectionate regard, which the people bore to the
memory of his father, and which was naturally transferred
to the young prince upon the throne. The different
characters of the&s;e three dukes, rendered them al&s;o a
counterpoize to each other; and it was natural to ex|pect,
that any dangerous de&s;igns, which might be form|ed
by one brother, would meet with oppo&s;ition from the
others. Lanca&s;ter, who&s;e age and experience and au|thority
under the late King, gave him the a&s;cendant
among them; tho' his integrity &s;eemed not proof again&s;t
great temptations, was neither of an enterprizing &s;pirit,
nor of a popular and engaging temper. York was in|dolent,
unactive, and of a &s;lender capacity. Gloce&s;ter
was turbulent, bold, and popular; but being the younge&s;t
of the family, was re&s;trained by the power and autho|rity
of his elder brothers. There appeared, therefore,
no circum&s;tance in the dome&s;tic &s;ituation of England,
which might endanger the public peace, or give any
immediate apprehen&s;ions to the lovers of their country.</P>
<P>BUT as Edward, tho' he had fixed the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to
the crown, had taken no care to e&s;tabli&s;h a plan of go|vernment
during the minority of his grand&s;on; it be|hoved
the parliament to &s;upply this defect: And the
hou&s;e of commons di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves, by taking
the lead on that occa&s;ion. This hou&s;e, which had been
ri&s;ing to consideration during the whole cour&s;e of the
late reign, naturally received an acce&s;&s;ion of power du|ring
the minority; and as it was now becoming a &s;cene
<PB N="3" REF="9">
of bu&s;ine&s;s, the commons cho&s;e for the fir&s;t time a
&s;peaker, who might per&s;erve order in their debates, and
maintain tho&s;e forms, which are requi&s;ite in all numer|ous
a&s;&s;emblies. Peter de la Mare was the man pitched
on; the &s;ame per&s;on who had been impri&s;oned and de|tained
in cu&s;tody by the late King for his freedom of
&s;peech in attacking the mi&s;tre&s;s and the mini&s;ters of that
prince. But tho' this election di&s;covered a &s;pirit of li|berty
in the commons, and was followed by farther at|tacks
both on the&s;e mini&s;ters, and on Alice Pierce<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 150.</NOTE>,
they were &s;till too much &s;en&s;ible of their great inferio|rity,
to a&s;&s;ume at fir&s;t any immediate &s;hare in the ad|mini&s;tration
of government, or the care of the King's
per&s;on. They were contented to apply by petition to
the lords for that purpo&s;e, and de&s;ire them both to ap|point
a council of nine, who might direct the public
bu&s;ine&s;s, and to choo&s;e men of a virtuous life and con|ver&s;ation,
who might in&s;pect the conduct and education
of the young prince. The lords complied with the fir&s;t
part of this reque&s;t, and elected the bi&s;hops of London,
Carli&s;le, and Sali&s;bury, the earls of Marche and Staf|ford,
&s;ir Richard de Stafford, &s;ir Henry le Scrope, &s;ir
John Devereux, and &s;ir Hugh Segrave, to whom they
gave authority for a year to conduct the ordinary cour&s;e
of bu&s;ine&s;s<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vii. p. 161.</NOTE>. But as to the regulation of the King's
hou&s;ehold, they declined interpo&s;ing in an office, which,
they &s;aid, was both &s;o invidious in it&s;elf, and might
prove &s;o di&s;agreeable to his maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>THE commons, as they acquired more courage, ven|tured
to proceed a &s;tep farther in their applications.
They pre&s;ented a petition, in which they prayed the
King to check the prevailing cu&s;tom among the barons
of forming illegal confederacies together, and &s;upport|ing
each other, as well as men of inferior rank, in the

violations of law and ju&s;tice. They received from the
throne a general and an obliging an&s;wer to this peti|tion:
But another part of their application, that all the
great officers &s;hould, during the King's minority, be ap|pointed
by parliament, which &s;eemed to require the con|currence
of the commons, as well as that of the upper
hou&s;e, in the nomination, was not complied with: The
lords alone a&s;&s;umed the power of appointing the&s;e offi|cers:
The commons tacitly acquie&s;ced in their choice;
and thought, that, for the pre&s;ent, they had proceeded
a &s;ufficient length, if they but advanced their preten&s;ions,
tho' rejected, of interpo&s;ing in the&s;e more important
matters of &s;tate.</P>
<P>ON this footing then the government &s;tood. The
admini&s;tration was conducted entirely in the King's
name: No regency was expre&s;sly appointed: The coun|cil
and the great officers, named by the peers, did their
duty, each in his &s;eparate department: And the whole
&s;y&s;tem was for &s;ome years kept together, by the &s;ecret
authority o$ the King's uncles, e&s;pecially of the duke
of Lanca&s;ter, who was in reality the regent.</P>
<P>THE parliament was di&s;&s;olved, after the commons had
repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of their being re-a&s;&s;embled once
every year, as appointed by law; and after having
elected two citizens as their trea&s;urers, to receive and
di&s;bur&s;e the produce of two fifteens and tenths, which
they voted to the crown. In the other parliaments cal|led
during the minority, the commons &s;till di&s;cover a
&s;trong &s;pirit of freedom and &s;en&s;e of their own authority,
which, without, $$eeding any di&s;turbance, tended to &s;e|cure
their independance and that of the people<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P>In the fifth year of the King, <HI>the commons complained of the govern|ment about the King's per&s;on, his court, the exce&s;&s;ive number of his &s;ervants, of the abu&s;es in the Chancery, King's Bench, Common Pleas, Exchequer, and of grievous oppre&s;&s;ions in the country, by the great multitudes of maintainers of quarrels,</HI> (men linked in confederacies together) <HI>who behaved them&s;elves like kings in the country, &s;o as there was very little law or right, and of other things which they &s;aid were the cau&s;e of the late commotions under Wat Tyler.</HI> Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. i. p 365. This irregular government, which no king and no hou&s;e of commons had been able to remedy, was the &s;ource of the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the great, and turbulency of the people, as well as tyranny of the princes. If &s;ubjects would enjoy liberty, and Kings &s;e|curity, the laws mu&s;t be executed.</P>
<P>In the ninth of this reign, the commons al&s;o di&s;covered an accuracy and a jealou&s;y of liberty, which we &s;hould little expect in the&s;e rude times. &startq;It was agreed by parliament,&endq; &s;ays Cotton $word$, &startq;that the &s;ub&s;idy of wools, wool fells, and &s;kins, granted $word$ King until the time of Mid-&s;ummer then en&s;uing, &s;hould cea&s;e $sapn$ &s;ame time unto the fea&s;t of St. Peter <HI>ad vincula;</HI> for that $word$ by the King &s;hould be interrupted for claiming &s;uch grant as due.&endq; $word$ al&s;o Cotton, p. 198.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="13">
EDWARD had left his grand&s;on involved in many dan|gerous
wars. The preten&s;ions of the duke of Lanca&s;ter
to the crown of Ca&s;tile, made that kingdom &s;till per&s;e|vere
in ho&s;tilities again&s;t England. Scotland, who&s;e
throne was now filled by Robert Steuart, nephew to
David Bruce, and the fir&s;t prince of that family, main|tained
&s;uch clo&s;e connexions with France, that war with
the one crown almo&s;t ncce&s;&s;arily produced ho&s;tilities
with the other. The French monarch, who&s;e prudent
conduct had acquired him the &s;irname of <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> as he
had already baffled all the experience and valour of the
two Edwards, was likely to prove a dangerous enemy
to a minor King; but his genius, which was not natu|rally
enterprizing, led him not, at pre&s;ent, to give any
great di&s;turbance to his neighbours; and he laboured,
be&s;ides, under many difficulties at home, which it was
nece&s;&s;ary for him to &s;urmount, before he could think of
making conque&s;ts in an enemy's country. England was
ma&s;ter of Calais, Bourdeaux, and Bayonne; had lately
acquired po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cherbourg, from the ce&s;&s;ion of the
King of Navarre, and of Bre&s;t from that of the duke
<PB N="6" REF="14">
of Brittany<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vii. p. 190.</NOTE>; and having thus acce&s;s into France from
every quarter, was able, even in its pre&s;ent &s;ituation, to
give annoyance to his government. Before Charles could
remove them from the&s;e important po&s;ts, he died in the
flower of his age, and left his kingdom to a minor &s;on,
who bore the name of Charles VI.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE the war with France was carried on in
a manner &s;omewhat languid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1378.</NOTE> and produced no enterprize
of great lu&s;tre or renown. Sir Hugh Calverley, who had
formerly headed a company of banditti in France, (for he,
as well as Sir Robert Knolles, and many of the mo&s;t re|nowned
commanders of Edward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1380.</NOTE> had once followed that
di&s;honourable profe&s;&s;ion) was governor of Calais; and
making an inroad into Picardy, with a detachment of the
garri&s;on, he &s;et fire to Boulogne<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing, p. 209.</NOTE>. The duke of Lan|ca&s;ter
conducted an army into Brittany, but returned
without being able to perform any memorable action. In
a &s;ub&s;equent year, the duke of Gloce&s;ter marched out
of Calais with a body of 2000 cavalry, and 8000 in|fantry;
and &s;crupled not, with this &s;mall army, to enter
into the heart of France, and to continue his ravages,
thro' Picardy, Champaigne, the Brie, the Beau&s;&s;e, the
Gatinois, the Orleanois, till he reached his allies in the
province of Brittany<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 2. chap. 50, 51. Wal&s;ing. p. 239.</NOTE>. The duke of Burgundy, at the
head of a more con&s;iderable army, came within &s;ight
of him; but the French were &s;o over-awed by the for|mer
&s;ucce&s;&s;es of the Engli&s;h, that no &s;uperiority of num|bers
could tempt them to venture a pitched battle with
the troops of that nation. As the duke of Brittany, &s;oon
after the arrival of the&s;e &s;uccours, formed an accommo|dation
with the court of France; this enterprize al&s;o
<PB N="7" REF="15">
proved in the i&s;&s;ue un&s;ucce&s;sful, and made no durable
impre&s;&s;ion upon the enemy.</P>
<P>THE expences of the&s;e armaments, and the u&s;ual want
of oeconomy attending a minority, much exhau&s;ted the
Engli&s;h trea&s;ury, and obliged the parliament, in order
to &s;upply it, to impo&s;e a new and extraordinary tax of three
groats on every per&s;on, male and female, above fifteen
years of age; and they ordained that, in levying that
tax, the opulent &s;hould relieve the poor by an equitable
compen&s;ation. This impo&s;ition excited a mutiny, which
was very &s;ingular in its circum&s;tances. All hi&s;tory
abounds with examples, where the great tyrannize over
the meaner &s;ort: But here the lowe&s;t populace ro&s;e
again&s;t their rulers, exerci&s;ed the mo&s;t cruel ravages upon
them, and took vengeance for all their former oppre&s;|&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE faint dawning of the arts and of good govern|ment
in that age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1381.</NOTE> had excited the minds of the popu|lace,
in different &s;tates of Europe, to wi&s;h for a better
condition, and to murmur again&s;t tho&s;e chains, which the
laws, enacted by the haughty nobility and gentry, had
&s;o long impo&s;ed upon them. The commotions of the
people in Flanders, the mutiny of the pea&s;ants in France,
were the natural effects of this growing &s;pirit of inde|pendance;
and the report of the&s;e events, being brought
into England, where per&s;onal &s;lavery was more general
than in any other country of Europe<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 2. chap. 74.</NOTE>, had prepared
the minds of the multitude for an in&s;urrecti|on.
One John Ball al&s;o, a &s;editious preacher, who affected low
popularity, went about the country, and inculcated on
his audience the principles of the fir&s;t origin of mankind
from one common &s;tock, their equal right to liberty and
to all the goods of nature, the tyranny of artificial
<PB N="8" REF="16">
di&s;tinctions, and the abu&s;es which had ari&s;en from the
degradation of the more con&s;iderable, part of the &s;pecies,
and the aggrandizement of a few in&s;olent rulers<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">$word$, liv. 2. chap. 74. Wal&s;ingham, p. 275.</NOTE>. The&s;e
doctrines, &s;o agreeable to the populace and &s;o conform|able
to the ideas of primitive equality, which are en|graven

A great body of them quartered them&s;elves at

<P>DURING this tran&s;action, another body of the rebels

continued their ravages in the city<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 250, 251.</NOTE>. The King pa&s;&s;ing
along Smithfield, very &s;lenderly guarded, met with Wat
Tyler, at the head of the&s;e rioters, and entered into a
conference with him. Tyler, having ordered his com|panions
to retire till he &s;hould give them a &s;ignal, after
which they were to murder all the company except the
King him&s;elf, whom they were to detain pri&s;oner, feared
not to come into the mid&s;t of the royal retinue. He
there behaved him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, that Walworth,
the mayor of London, not able to bear his in&s;olence,
drew his &s;word, and &s;truck him &s;o violent a blow as
brought him to the ground, where he was in&s;tantly di&s;|patched
by others of the King's train. The mutineers
&s;eeing their leader fall, prepared them&s;elves for revenge;
and this whole company, with the King him&s;elf, had un|doubtedly
peri&s;hed on the &s;pot, had it not been for an
extraordinary pre&s;ence of mind which Richard di&s;covered
on this occa&s;ion. He ordered his company to &s;top; he
advanced alone towards the enraged multitude; and
<PB N="11" REF="19">
acco&s;ting them with an affable and intrepid countenance,
he a&s;ked them, &startq;What is the meaning of this di&s;order,
my good people? Are you angry that you have lo&s;t
your leader? I am your King: I will be your leader.&endq;
The populace, overawed by his pre&s;ence, implicitly fol|lowed
him: He led them out into the fields, to prevent
any di&s;order which might have ari&s;en by their continuing
in the city: Being there joined by Sir Robert Knolles
and a body of well armed veteran &s;oldiers, who had been
&s;ecretly drawn together, he &s;trictly prohibited that officer
from falling on the rioters, and committing an undi&s;tin|gui&s;hed
&s;laughter upon them; and he peaceably di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
them with the &s;ame charters, which had been granted to
their companions<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, vol. ii. chap. 77. Wal&s;ingham, p. 252. Knyghton, p. 2637.</NOTE>. Soon after, the nobility and gentry,
hearing of the King's danger, in which they were all
involved, flocked to London with their adherents and
retainers; and Richard took the field at the head of an
army 40,000 &s;trong<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 267.</NOTE>. It then behoved all the other
rebels to &s;ubmit: The charters of enfranchi&s;ement and
pardon were revoked by parliament; the low people were
reduced to the &s;ame &s;lavi&s;h condition as before, and &s;eve|ral
of the ringleaders were &s;everely puni&s;hed for the late
di&s;orders. It was pretended, that the intentions of the
in&s;urgents had been to &s;eize the King's per&s;on, to carry
him thro' England at their head, to murder all the nobi|lity,
gentry and lawyers, and even all the bi&s;hops and
prie&s;ts, except the mendicant friars; to di&s;patch after|wards
the King him&s;elf; and having thus reduced all the
people to a level, to order the kingdom at their plea&s;ure<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 265.</NOTE>.
It is not impo&s;&s;ible, that many of them, in the delirium
of their fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, might have formed &s;uch projects:
But of all the evils attending human &s;ociety, the in&s;ur|rections
of the populace, when not rai&s;ed and &s;upported
<PB N="12" REF="20">
by per&s;ons of higher quality, is the lea&s;t to be dreaded:
The mi&s;chiefs, con&s;equent on an abolition of all rank
di&s;tinction, become &s;o great, that they are immedi|ately
felt, and &s;oon bring back affairs to their former
order and arrangement.</P>
<P>A YOUTH of &s;ixteen, (which was at this time the King's
age) that had di&s;covered &s;o much courage, pre&s;ence of
mind, and addre&s;s, and had &s;o dextrou&s;ly eluded the vio|lence
of this tumult, gave great hopes to the nation;
and it was natural to expert, that he would, in the
cour&s;e of his life, equal the glories, which had &s;o uni|formly
attended his father and his grandfather, in all their
undertakings.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1385.</NOTE> But in proportion as Richard advanced
in years, the&s;e hopes were bla&s;ted; and his want of ca|pacity,
at lea&s;t of &s;olid judgment, appeared in every
enterprize, which he attempted. The Scots, &s;en&s;ible
of their own deficiency in cavalry, had applied to the
regency of Charles VI. and John de Vienne, admiral
of France, had been &s;ent over with a body of 1500 men
at arms, to &s;upport them in their incur&s;ions again&s;t the
Engli&s;h. The danger was now deemed by the King's
uncles &s;omewhat &s;erious; and a great army of 60,000
men was levied and conducted again&s;t Scotland, with
Richard him&s;elf at the head of it. The Scots pretended
not to make re&s;i&s;tance to &s;o great a force: They aban|doned
without &s;cruple their country to be pillaged and
de&s;troyed by the enemy: And when de Vienne expre&s;&s;ed
his &s;urprize at this plan of operations, they told him,
that all their cattle was driven into the fore&s;ts and fa&s;t|ne&s;&s;es;
that their hou&s;es and other goods were of no
value; and that they well knew how to compen&s;ate them|&s;elves
for any lo&s;&s;es, which they might &s;u&s;tain in that
re&s;pect, by making an inva&s;ion on the Engli&s;h. Ac|cordingly,
when Richard entered Scotland by Berwic
and the ea&s;t coa&s;t, the Scots and French, to the number
of 30,000 men, pa&s;&s;ed the borders of England by the
<PB N="13" REF="21">
we&s;t, and carrying on their ravages thro' Cumberland,
We&s;tmoreland, and Lanca&s;hire, collected a rich booty,
and then returned in tranquillity to their own country.
Richard meanwhile advanced towards Edinburgh, and
de&s;troyed in his way all the towns and villages on each
&s;ide of him: He reduced that city to a&s;hes: He treated
in the &s;ame manner Perth, Dundee, and other places in
the low countries; but when he was advi&s;ed to march
towards the we&s;t coa&s;t, to await there the return of the
enemy, and to take revenge on them for their deva&s;ta|tions,
his impatience to be in England, and enjoy his
u&s;ual plea&s;ures and amu&s;ements, was more prevalent;
and he carried back his army, without effecting any thing
by all the&s;e mighty preparations. The Scots, &s;oon after,
finding the &s;olid bodies of French cavalry very u&s;ele&s;s
in that de&s;ultory kind of war, to which they confined
them&s;elves, treated their allies &s;o ill, that the French
returned home; very much di&s;gu&s;ted with the country,
and the manners of its inhabitants<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 2. chap. 149, 150, &amp;c. liv. 3. chap. 52. Wal|&s;ingham, p. 316, 317.</NOTE>. The Engli&s;h, tho'
they regretted the indolence and di&s;&s;olute manners of their
King, &s;aw them&s;elves for the future &s;ecured again&s;t any
dangerous inva&s;ion from that quarter.</P>
<P>BUT it was &s;o material an intere&s;t of the French court
to wre&s;t the &s;ea-port towns from<NOTE PLACE="marg">1386.</NOTE> the hands of their ene|my,
that they re&s;olved to attempt it by &s;ome other expe|dient,
and found no means &s;o likely as by an inva&s;ion
of England it&s;elf. They collected an immen&s;e fleet and
army at Slui&s;e; for the Flemings were now in alliance
with them: All the nobility of France were engaged in
this enterprize: The Engli&s;h were kept in alarm: Great
preparations were made for the reception of the invaders:
<PB N="14" REF="22">
And tho' the di&s;per&s;ion of the French &s;hips by a &s;torm,
and the taking of many of them by the Engli&s;h, before
the embarkation of the troops, freed the kingdom from
the pre&s;ent danger, they were fully &s;en&s;ible, that this
perilous &s;ituation might every moment return upon
them<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 3. chap. 41. 53. Wal&s;ingham, p. 321, 323.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE were two circum&s;tanccs chiefly, which en|gaged
the French at this time to think of &s;uch attempts.
The one was the ab&s;ence of the duke of Lanca&s;ter, who
had carried into Spain all the flower of the Engli&s;h mili|tary
force, in pro&s;ecution of his vain claim to the crown
of Ca&s;tile; an enterprize, in which, after &s;ome promi&s;|ing
&s;ucce&s;s, he was finally di&s;appointed: The other was,
the violent di&s;&s;en&s;ions and di&s;orders, which had taken
place in the Engli&s;h government.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubjection, in which Richard was held by his
uncles, particularly by the duke of Gloce&s;ter, a prince
of enterprize and genius, tho' it was not un&s;uitable to
his years and &s;lender capacity, was extremely di&s;agreeable
to his violent temper; and he began to rebel again&s;t the
yoke impo&s;ed upon him. Robert de Vere, earl of Oxford,
a young man of a noble family, of an agreeable figure, but
of di&s;&s;olute manners, had acquired an entire a&s;cendant
over him; and ruled him with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute authority.
The King knew &s;o little bounds to his affection, that
he fir&s;t created his favourite marquis of Dublin, a title
before unknown in England, and then duke of Ireland;
and transferred to him by patent, which was confirmed
in parliament, the entire &s;overeignty for life of that
i&s;land<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 310, 311. Cox's Hi&s;t, of Ireland, p. 129. Wal&s;ing|ham, p. 324.</NOTE>. He gave him in marriage his cou&s;in german,
the daughter of Ingelram de Couci, earl of Bedford; but
&s;oon after permitted him to repudiate that lady, tho' of
<PB N="15" REF="23">
an unexceptionable character, and to marry a foreigner,
a Bohemian, with whom he had become enamoured<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 328.</NOTE>.
The&s;e public declarations of attachment turned the
whole court towards the favourite: All graces pa&s;&s;ed
thro' his hands: Acce&s;s to the King could only be ob|tained
thro' his mediation: And Richard &s;eemed to take
no plea&s;ure in royal authority, but &s;o far as it enabled
him to load with favours and titles and dignities this ob|ject
of his affections.</P>
<P>THE jealou&s;y of power immediately produced an ani|mo&s;ity<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;content of the ba|rons.</NOTE>
between the minion and his creatures on the one
hand, and the princes of the blood and chief nobility on
the other; and the u&s;ual complaints again&s;t the in&s;olence
of favourites were loudly echoed and greedily received, in
every part of the kingdom. Mowbray, earl of Notting|ham,
the $mare&s;chal, Fitz-Alan earl of Arundel, Piercy
earl of Northumberland, Montacute earl of Sali&s;bury,
Beauchamp earl of Warwic, were all connected with
each other, and with the princes, by friend&s;hip or allian|ces,
and &s;till more by their antipathy to tho&s;e who had
eclip&s;ed them in the King's favour and confidence. No
longer kept in awe by the per&s;onal character of the prince,
they &s;corned to &s;ubmit to his mini&s;ters; and the methods,
which they took to redre&s;s the grievance complained of,
well &s;uited the violence of that age, and the de&s;perate
extremities, to which every opposition was &s;ure to be
in&s;tantly carried.</P>
<P>MICHAEL DE LA POLE, the pre&s;ent chancellor, and
lately created earl of Suffolk, was the &s;on of an eminent
merchant; but had ri&s;en by his abilities and valour during
the wars of Edward III. had acquired the friend&s;hip of
that monarch, and was e&s;teemed the per&s;on of greate&s;t
experience and capacity among tho&s;e who were attached
to the duke of Ireland and the King's &s;ecret council.

The duke of Gloce&s;ter, who had the hou&s;e of commons
at his devotion, impelled them to exerci&s;e that power
which they &s;eem fir&s;t to have a&s;&s;umed again&s;t lord La|timer
during the declining years of the late King; and
an impeachment again&s;t the chancellor was carried up by
them to the hou&s;e of peers, which was no le&s;s at his de|votion.
The King fore&s;aw the tempe&s;t preparing again&s;t
him and his mini&s;ters. After attempting in vain to rou&s;e
the Londoners to his defence, he withdrew from parlia|ment,
and retired with his court to Eltham. The par|liament
&s;ent a deputation, inviting him to return, and
threatening, that, if he continued to ab&s;ent him&s;elf, they
would immediately di&s;&s;olve, and leave the nation, tho'
at that time in imminent danger of a French inva&s;ion,
without any &s;upport or &s;upply for its defence. At the
&s;ame time, a member was encouraged to call for the re|cord,
containing the parliamentary depo&s;ition of Edward II.;
a plain intimation of the fate, which Richard,
if he continued refractory, had rea&s;on to expect from
them. The King, finding him&s;elf unable to re&s;i&s;t, was
contented to &s;tipulate, that, except fini&s;hing the pre&s;ent
impeachment again&s;t Suffolk, no attack &s;hould be made
again&s;t any other of his mini&s;ters; and on that condition,
he returned to the parliament<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2715, &amp;c. The &s;ame author, p. 2680, tells us, that the King, in return to the me&s;&s;age, &s;aid, that he would not for their de&s;ire remove the meane&s;t &s;cullion from his kitchen. This author al&s;o tells us, that the King &s;aid to the commi&s;&s;ioners, when they ha|rangued him, that he &s;aw his &s;ubjects were rebellious, and his be&s;t way would be to call in the King of France to his aid. But it is plain, that, all the&s;e &s;peeches were either intended by Knyghton merely as an orna|ment to his hi&s;tory, or are fal&s;e. For (1) when the five lords accu&s;e the King's mini&s;ters in the next parliament, and impute to them every ra&s;h action of the King, they &s;peak nothing of the&s;e replies which are &s;o ob|noxious, were &s;o recent, and are pretended to have been &s;o public. (2) The King, &s;o far from having any connexions at that time with France, was threatened with a dangerous invasion from that kingdom.

&s;ome weight in the con&s;titution, he tried &s;ecretly &s;ome
expedients for procuring a favourable election: He &s;ounded &s;ome
of the &s;heriffs, who being at that time both
the returning officers, and magi&s;trates of great power
in the counties, would naturally have con&s;iderable influ|ence
in elections: But as mo&s;t of them had been appointed
by his uncles, either during his minority, or during the
cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent commi&s;&s;ion, he found them in ge|neral
aver&s;e to his enterprize. The &s;entiments and incli|nations
of the judges were more favourable to him. He
met at Nottingham &s;ir Robert Tre&s;ilian, chief ju&s;tice of
the King's Bench, &s;ir Robert Belknappe, chief ju&s;tice of
the Common Pleas, &s;ir John Cary, chief baron of the
Exchequer, Holt, Fulthorpe, and Bourg, inferior ju&s;tices,
and Lokton, &s;erjeant at law; and he propo&s;ed to them
&s;ome queries, which the&s;e lawyers, either from the influ|ence
of his authority or of rea&s;on; made no &s;cruple of an|&s;wering
in the way he de&s;ired. They declared, that the
late commi&s;&s;ion was derogatory to the royalty and prero|gative
of the King; that tho&s;e who procured it, or ad|vi&s;ed
the King to con&s;ent to it, were puni&s;hable with
death; that tho&s;e who nece&s;&s;itated and compelled him
were guilty of trea&s;on; that tho&s;e were equally criminal
who &s;hould per&s;evere in maintaining it; that the King
has the right of di&s;&s;olving parliaments when he plea&s;es;
that the parliament, while it &s;its, mu&s;t proceed fir&s;t upon
the King's bu&s;ine&s;s; and that that a&s;&s;embly cannot with|out
the King's con&s;ent impeach any of his mini&s;ters and
<PB N="20" REF="28">
judges<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2694. Ypod Neu&s;t. p. 541.</NOTE>. Even according to our pre&s;ent &s;trict maxims
with regard to law and the royal prerogative, all the&s;e
determinations, except the two la&s;t, were entirely ju&s;ti|fiable:
And as the great privileges of the commons, par|ticularly
that of impeachment, were hitherto very new,
and &s;upported by few precedents, there want not rea&s;ons
of apology for the&s;e opinions of the judges. They &s;igned
therefore their an&s;wer to the King's queries before the
archbi&s;hops of York and Dublin, the bi&s;hops of Dur|ham,
Chiche&s;ter, and Bangor, the Duke of Ireland, the
earl of Suffolk, and two other coun&s;ellors of inferior
quality.</P>
<P>THE duke of Gloce&s;ter, and his adherents, &s;oon got
intelligence of this &s;ecret con&s;ultation; and were, natu|rally
much alarmed at it. They &s;aw the King's inten|tion,
not only of recovering his authority, but of
puni&s;hing them for invading it; and they determin|ed
to prevent the execution of his purpo&s;e. As
&s;oon as he came to London, which, they knew, was
well di&s;po&s;ed to their party, they &s;ecretly a&s;&s;embled
their forces, and appeared in arms at Haringay-park,
near Highgate, with a power, which Richard and
his mini&s;ters were not able to re&s;i&s;t. They &s;ent him a
me&s;&s;age by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and the lords
Lovel, Cobham, and Devereux, and demanded, that the
per&s;ons who had &s;educed him by their pernicious coun&s;el,
and were traitors both to him and to the kingdom,
&s;hould be delivered to them. A few days after, they ap|peared
in his pre&s;ence, armed and attended with armed
followers; and they accu&s;ed by name the archbi&s;hop of
York, the duke of Ireland, the earl of Suffolk, Sir Ro|bert
Tre&s;ilian, and Sir Nicholas Brembre, as public and
dangerous enemies to the &s;tate. They threw down their
gauntlets before the king, and fiercely offered to main|tain
<PB N="21" REF="29">
the truth of their charge by duel. The per&s;ons ac|cu&s;ed,
and all the other obnoxious mini&s;ters, had with|drawn
or concealed them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE duke of Ireland fled to Che&s;hire, and levied &s;ome
forces, with which he advanced to relieve the King
from the violence of the nobles. Gloce&s;ter encountered
him in Oxford&s;hire with much &s;uperior forces; routed
him, di&s;per&s;ed his followers, and obliged him to fly into
the Low-Countries, where he died in exile a few years
after.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1388.</NOTE> The lords then appeared at London with an army
of 40,000 men;<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d February.</NOTE> and having obliged the King to &s;um|mon
a parliament, which was entirely at their devotion,
they had full power, by ob&s;erving a few legal forms, to
take vengeance on all their enemies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expul&s;ion or execu|tion
of the King's mini&s;ters.</NOTE> Five, great peers,
men who&s;e combined power was able at any time to &s;hake
the throne, Thomas duke of Gloce&s;ter, the King's
uncle; Henry earl of Derby, &s;on of the duke of Lan|ca&s;ter;
Richard earl of Arundel and Surrey; Thomas
earl of Warwic, and Thomas earl of Nottingham, and
mare&s;achal of England, entered before the parliament an
accu&s;ation or appeal, as it was called, again&s;t the five
coun&s;ellors, whom they had already accu&s;ed before the
King. The parliament, who ought to have been judges,
were not a&s;hamed to impo&s;e an oath on all their members,
by which they bound them&s;elves to live and die with the
lords appellants, and to defend them again&s;t all their
enemies with their lives and fortunes<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 322.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE other proceedings were well &s;uited to the violence
and iniquity of the times. A charge, con&s;i&s;ting of thirty|nine
articles, was delivered in by the appellants; and
as none of the accu&s;ed coun&s;ellors, except Sir Nicholas
Brembre, was in cu&s;tody, the re&s;t were cited to an&s;wer;
and upon their non-appearance, after a very &s;hort interval,
<PB N="22" REF="30">
without hearing a witne&s;s, without examining a fact, or
deliberating on one point of law, the hou&s;e of peers decla|red
them guilty of high trea&s;on. Sir Nicholas Brembre,
who was produced in court, had the appearance, and
probably no more than the appearance, of a trial: The
peers, tho' they were not by law his proper judges,
pronounced, in a very &s;ummary manner, &s;entence of
death upon him; and he was executed, together with
Sir Robert Tre&s;ilian, who had been di&s;covered and taken
in the interval.</P>
<P>IT would be tedious to recite the whole charge deli|vered
in again&s;t the five coun&s;ellors; which is to be
met with in &s;everal collections<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2715. Tyrrel, vol. iii. part 2. p. 919. from the records. Parliamentary Hi&s;tory, vol. i. p. 414.</NOTE>. It is &s;ufficient to ob|&s;erve
in general, that if we rea&s;on upon the &s;uppo&s;ition,
which is the true one, that the royal prerogative was in|vaded
by the commi&s;&s;ion given to the duke of Gloce&s;|ter
and his a&s;&s;ociates, and that the King's per&s;on was
afterwards detained in cu&s;tody by rebels, many of the
articles will appear, not only to imply no crime in the
duke of Ireland and the mini&s;ters, but to impute to them
actions, which were laudable, and which they were
bound by their allegiance to perform. The few articles
re&s;pecting the conduct of the&s;e mini&s;ters before that
commi&s;&s;ion, which &s;ubverted the con&s;titution, and anni|hilated
all ju&s;tice and legal authority, are vague and ge|neral;
&s;uch as their engro&s;&s;ing the King's favour, keep|ing
the grandees at a di&s;tance from him, obtaining un|rea&s;onable
grants for them&s;elves or their creatures, and
di&s;&s;ipating the public trea&s;ure by u&s;ele&s;s expences. No
violence is objected to them; no particular illegal act<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><P>We mu&s;t except the 12th article, wihich accu&s;es Brembre of hav|ing cut off the heads of twenty-two pri&s;oners, confined for felony or debt, without warrant or proce&s;s of law: But as it is not conceivable what intere&s;t Brombre could have to treat the&s;e felons and debtors in &s;uch a manner; we may pre&s;ume that the fact is either fal&s;e or mi&s;re|pre&s;ented. It was in the&s;e mens power to &s;ay any thing again&s;t the per&s;ons accu&s;ed: No defence or apology was admitted: All was law|le&s;s will and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>They are al&s;o accu|&s;ed of de&s;igns to murder the lords; but the&s;e accu&s;ations either are general, or de&s;troy one another. Sometimes, as in article 15th, they intend to murder them by means of the mayor and city of London: Sometimes, as in article 28th, by trial and fal&s;e in|que&s;ts: Sometimes, as in article 28th, by means of the King of France, who was to receive Calais for his pains.</P></NOTE>;
<PB N="23" REF="31">
no breach of any &s;tatute; and their admini&s;tration may
therefore be concluded to have been &s;o far innocent and
inoffen&s;ive. All the di&s;orders indeed &s;eem to have pro|ceeded,
not from any infringement of the laws attempted
by the mini&s;ters, but merely from a rival&s;hip of power,
which the duke of Gloce&s;ter, and the great nobility,
agreeable to the genius of the times, carried to the utmo&s;t
extremity again&s;t their opponents, without any regard to
rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, of humanity.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e were not the only acts of violence committed
during the triumph of the party. All the other judges,
who had &s;igned the extrajudicial opinions at Nottingham,
were condemned to death, and were, as a grace or fa|vour,
bani&s;hed to Ireland; tho' they pleaded the fear of
their lives, and the menaces of the King's mini&s;ters as
their excu&s;e. The lord Beauchamp of Holt, &s;ir James
Berners, and John Sali&s;bury, were al&s;o tried and con|demned
for high trea&s;on; merely becau&s;e they had at|tempted
to defeat the late commi&s;&s;ion: But the life of
the latter was &s;pared. The fate of &s;ir Simon Burley was
more &s;evere: This gentleman was much beloved for
his per&s;onal merit, had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by many
honourable actions<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">At lea&s;t, this is the character given of him by Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 2. who knew him per&s;onally: Wal&s;in, p. 334, gives a very different character of him; but he is a writer &s;omewhat pa&s;&s;ionate and partial; and the choice made of this gentleman by Edward III and the Black Prince for the education of Richard, makes the character given of him by Froi&s;&s;art, much more probable.</NOTE>, was created knight of the garter,
<PB N="24" REF="32">
and had been appointed governor to Richard, by the
choice of the late King and the Black, Prince: He had
attended his ma&s;ter from the earlie&s;t infancy of that
prince, and had ever remained extremely attached to
him: Yet all the&s;e con&s;iderations could not &s;ave him from
falling a victim to Gloce&s;ter's vengeance. This execu|tion,
more than all the others, made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on
Richard's mind: His Queen too (for he was already
married to the &s;i&s;ter of the Emperor Winche&s;laus, King
of Bohemia) intere&s;ted her&s;elf extremely in behalf of
Burley: She remained three hours on her knees before
the earl of Gloce&s;ter, pleading for that gentleman's life;
but tho' &s;he was become extremely popular by her amiable
qualities, which had acquired her the appellation of <HI>the
good Queen Ann;</HI> her petition was &s;ternly rejected by the
inexorable tyrant.</P>
<P>THE parliament concluded this violent &s;cene by a de|claration,
that none of the articles, decided on the&s;e
trials to be trea&s;on, &s;hould ever afterwards be drawn in|to
precedent by the judges, who were &s;till to con&s;ider
the &s;tatute of the twenty-fifth of Edward as the rule of
their conduct. The hou&s;e of lords &s;eem not at that time
to have known or acknowledged the principle, that they
them&s;elves were bound, in their judicial capacity, to fol|low
the rules, which they had e&s;tabli&s;hed in their legi&s;|lative<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">In general, the parliament in tho&s;e days never paid a proper regard to Edward's &s;tatute of trea&s;ons, tho' one of the mo&s;t advantageous laws for the &s;ubject that has ever been enacted. In the 17th of the King, <HI>the dukes of Lanca&s;ter and Gloce&s;ter complain to Richard that Sir Thomas Tal|bot, with others of his adherents, con&s;pired the death of the &s;aid dukes in divers parts of Che&s;hire, as the &s;ame was confe&s;&s;ed and well known; and praying that the parliament may judge of the fault. Whereupon the King and the lords in the parliament judged the &s;ame fact to be open and high trea&s;on: And hereup|on they award two writs, the one to the &s;heriff of York, and the other to the &s;heriffs of Derby, to take the body of the &s;aid Sir Thomas returnable in the King's $ench in the month of Ea&s;ter then en&s;uing. And open proclamation was made in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, that upon the &s;heriff's return, and at the next coming in of tbe &s;aid Sir Thomas, the &s;aid Thomas &s;hould be convicted of trea&s;on, and incur the lo&s;s and pain of the &s;ame: And all &s;uch as &s;hould receive him after the pro|clamation &s;hould incur the &s;ame lo&s;s and pain.</HI> Cotton, p. 354. It is to be ob&s;erved, that this extraordinary judgment was pa&s;&s;ed in a time of tran|quillity. Tho' the &s;tatute it&s;elf of Edward III. re&s;erves a power to the parliament to declare any new &s;pecies of trea&s;on, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that this power was re&s;erved to the hou&s;e of lords alone, or that men were to be judged by a law <HI>ex po&s;t facto.</HI> At lea&s;t, if &s;uch be the mean|ing of the clau&s;e; it may be affirmed, that men were at that time very ignorant of the fir&s;t principles of law and ju&s;tice.</NOTE>.
It was al&s;o enacted that every one &s;hould
<PB N="25" REF="33">
&s;wear to the perpetual maintenance and &s;upport of the
forfeitures and attainders, and of all the other acts pa&s;&s;ed
during this parliament. The archbi&s;hop of Canterbury
added the penalty of excommunication, as a farther &s;ecu|rity
of the&s;e deeds of violence.</P>
<P>IT might naturally be expected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1389.</NOTE> that the king, being
reduced to &s;uch &s;lavery by the combination of the princes
of the blood and the chief nobility, and having appeared
&s;o unable to defend his &s;ervants from the mo&s;t cruel effects
of their re&s;entment, would long remain in &s;ubjection to
them; and never would recover the royal power, with|out
the mo&s;t violent &s;truggles and convul&s;ions: But the
event proved otherwi&s;e. In le&s;s than a twelvemonth,
Richard, who was in his twenty-third year, declared in
council, that as he had now attained the full age, which
intitled him to govern by his own authority his kingdom
and hou&s;ehold, he re&s;olved to exerci&s;e his right of &s;ove|reignty;
and when no one ventured to contradict &s;o rea|&s;onable
an intention, he deprived Fitz-Alan archbi&s;hop
<PB N="26" REF="34">
of Canterbury of the dignity of chancellor, and be&s;towed
that high office on William of Wickham, bi&s;hop of
Winche&s;ter; the bi&s;hop of Hereford was di&s;placed from
the office of trea&s;urer, the earl of Arundel from that of
admiral; even the duke of Gloce&s;ter and the earl of
Warwic were removed for a time from the council-board:
And no oppo&s;ition was made to the&s;e great changes.
The hi&s;tory of this reign is very imperfect, and very little
to be depended on; except where it is &s;upported by the
public records: And it is not ea&s;y for us to a&s;&s;ign the
rea&s;on of this unexpected event. Perhaps, &s;ome &s;ecret
animo&s;ities, naturally to be expected in that &s;ituation,
had crept in among the great men, and enabled the King
to recover his authority. Perhaps, the violence of their
former proceedings had lo&s;t them the affections of the
people, who &s;oon repent of any cruel extremities, to
which they are carried by their leaders. However this
may be, Richard exerci&s;ed with moderation the autho|rity
which he had returned. He &s;eemed to be entirely
reconciled to his uncles<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, vol. ii. p. 170.</NOTE> and the other great men, of
whom he had &s;o much rea&s;on to complain: He never
attempted to recal from bani&s;hment the duke of Ireland,
whom he found &s;o obnoxious to them: He confirmed by
proclamation the general pardon, which the parliament
had pa&s;&s;ed for all offences: And he courted the affections
of the people, by voluntarily remitting &s;ome &s;ub&s;idies,
which had been granted him; a remarkable, and almo&s;t
a &s;ingular in&s;tance of &s;uch genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>AFTER this compo&s;ure of dome&s;tic differences, and
re&s;toration of the government to its natural &s;tate, there
pa&s;&s;es an interval of eight years, which affords not many
remarkable events. The duke of Lanca&s;ter returned
from Spain; having re&s;igned to his rival all preten&s;ions
to the crown of Ca&s;tile upon payment of a large &s;um
<PB N="27" REF="35">
of money<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2677. Wal&s;ingham, p. 342.</NOTE>, and having married his daughter, Philippa,
to the King of Portugal. The authority of this prince
&s;erved to counterbalance that of the duke of Gloce&s;ter,
and &s;ecured the power of Richard, who paid great court
to his elde&s;t uncle, by whom he had never been offended,
and whom he found more moderate in his temper than
the younger. He made acce&s;&s;ion to him for life of the
dutchy of Guienne<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. Vii. P. 659.</NOTE>, which the inclinations and change|able
humour of the Ga&s;cons had re&s;tored to the Engli&s;h
government; but as they remon&s;trated loudly again&s;t this
deed, it was finally, with the duke's con&s;ent, revoked
by Richard<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 687.</NOTE>. There happened an incident, which pro|duced
a di&s;&s;ention between Lanca&s;ter and his two bro|thers.
After the death of the Spani&s;h prince&s;s, he
e&s;pou&s;ed Catharine Swineford, daughter of a private
knight of Hainault, by whole alliance, York and Glo|ce&s;ter
thought the dignity of their family much injured:
But the King gratified his uncle by pa&s;&s;ing in parliament
a charter of legitimation to the children, whom that lady
had born him before marriage, and by creating the
elde&s;t earl of Somer&s;et<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 365. Wal&s;ingham, p. 352.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE wars, meanwhile, which Richard had inherited
with his crown, &s;till continued; tho' interrupted by fre|quent
truces, according to the practice of that age, and
conducted with little vigour, by rea&s;on of the weakne&s;s
of all parties. The French war was &s;carce heard of;
the tranquillity of the northern borders was only inter|rupted
by one inroad of the Scots, which proceeded
more from a rival&s;hip between the two martial families
of Piercy and Douglas, than from, any national quarrel:
A fierce battle or &s;kirmi&s;h was fought at Otterborne<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">15th Augu&s;t, 1388.</NOTE>,
<PB N="28" REF="36">
in which young Piercy, &s;irnamed <HI>Hot&s;pur,</HI> from his im|petuous
valour, was taken pri&s;oner, and Douglas &s;lain;
and the victory remained undecided<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">$roi&s;&s;art, liv. 3. chap. 124, 125, 126. Wal&s;ingham, p. 355.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1394.</NOTE> Some in&s;urrections
of the Iri&s;h obliged the King to make an expedition into
that country, which he reduced to obedience; and he
recovered, in &s;ome degree, by this enterprize, his cha|racter
of courage, which had &s;uffered a little by the in|activity
of his reign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1396.</NOTE> At la&s;t, the Engli&s;h and French
courts began to think in earne&s;t of a la&s;ting peace; but
found it &s;o difficult to adju&s;t their oppo&s;ite preten&s;ions,
that they were contented to e&s;tabli&s;h a truce of twenty|five
years<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vii. P. 820.</NOTE>: Bre&s;t and Cherbourg were re&s;tored, the
former to the duke of Brittany, the latter to the King
of Navarre: Both parties were left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all
the other places which they held at pre&s;ent: And to
render the amity between the two crowns more durable,
Richard, who was now a widower, was affianced to
I&s;abella, the daughter of Charles<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 811.</NOTE>. This prince&s;s was
only &s;even years of age; but the King agreed to &s;o un|equal
a match, chiefly that he might fortify him&s;elf,
by this alliance, again&s;t the enterprizes of his uncles and
the incurable turbulency as well as incon&s;tancy of his
barons.</P>
<P>THE admini&s;tration of the King, tho' it was not, in
this interval, &s;ullied by any unpopular act, except the
&s;eizure of the charter of London<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 727. Wal&s;ingham, p. 347.</NOTE>, which was &s;oon
after re&s;tored, had not tended much to fortify his autho|rity;
and his pre&s;onal character brought him into con|tempt,
even while his public government appeared in a
good mea&s;ure unexceptionable. Indolent, expen&s;ive, ad|dicted
to low plea&s;ures; he &s;pent his whole time in
fea&s;ting and jollity, and di&s;&s;ipated in idle &s;how, or in
<PB N="29" REF="37">
bounty to favourites of no reputation, that revenue
which the people expected to &s;ee him employ in enter|prizes
directed to public honour and advantage. He for|got
his rank by admitting all men to his familiarity;
and he was not &s;en&s;ible, that their acquaintance with the
qualities of his mind was not able to impre&s;s them with
the re&s;pect which he neglected to per&s;erve from his birth
and &s;tation. The earls of Kent and Huntington, his
half brothers, were his chief confidents and favourites;
and tho' he never devoted him&s;elf to them with &s;o pro|fu&s;e
an affection as that with which he had been attached
to the duke of Ireland, it was ea&s;y for men to &s;ee that
every grace pa&s;&s;ed thro' their hands, and that the King
had rendered him&s;elf a mere cypher in the government.
The &s;mall regard, which the public bore to his per&s;on,
di&s;po&s;ed them to murmur again&s;t his admini&s;tration, and
to receive with greedy ears every complaint, which the
di&s;contented or ambitious grandees &s;ugge&s;ted to them.</P>
<P>GLOCESTER &s;oon perceived all the advantages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1397.</NOTE> which
this di&s;&s;olute conduct gave him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabals of the duke of Gloce|&s;ter.</NOTE> and finding, that both
re&s;entment and jealou&s;y on the &s;ide of his nephew &s;till
prevented him from acquiring any a&s;cendant over that
prince, he determined to cultivate his popularity with
the nation, and to revenge him&s;elf on tho&s;e who eclip&s;ed
him in favour and authority. He &s;eldom appeared at
court or in council: He never declared his opinion but
in order to di&s;approve of the mea&s;ures embraced by the
King and his favourites: And he courted the friend&s;hip
of every man, whom di&s;appointments or private re&s;ent|ment
had rendered an enemy to the admini&s;tration. The
long truce with France was very unpopular with the
Engli&s;h, who breathed nothing but war again&s;t that ho&s;|tile
nation; and Gloce&s;ter took care to encourage all the
vulgar prejudices, which prevailed on this &s;ubject. For|getting
<PB N="30" REF="38">
the misfortunes, which attended the Engli&s;h arms
during the latter years of Edward; he made an invidi|ous
compari&s;on between the glories of that reign and the
inactivity of the pre&s;ent, and he lamented that Richard
&s;hould have degenerated &s;o far from the heroic virtues,

of Gloce&s;ter more de&s;perate views, and &s;uch as were
totally incompatible with the government and dome&s;tic
tranquillity of the nation. According to that hi&s;torian,
he propo&s;ed to his nephew, Roger Mortimer, earl of
Marche, whom Richard had declared his &s;ucce&s;&s;or,
to give him immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne, by the de|po&s;ition
of a prince, &s;o unworthy of government and
authority: And when Mortimer declined this project,
he re&s;olved to make a partition of the kingdom between
him&s;elf, his two brothers, and the earl of Arundel; and
to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s Richard entirely of the crown. The King,

either his own ruin or that of Gloce&s;ter was inevitable;
and he re&s;olved, by a ha&s;ty blow, to prevent the execu|tion
of &s;uch de&s;tructive projects. This is certain, that
Gloce&s;ter, by his own confe&s;&s;ion, had often affected to
&s;peak contemptuou&s;ly of the King's per&s;on and govern|ment;
had deliberated concerning the lawfulne&s;s of
throwing off allegiance to him; and had even born part
in a &s;ecret conference, where his depo&s;ition was pro|po&s;ed
and talked of, and determined<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 378. Tyrrel, vol. iii. part 2. p. 972, from the re|cords. Parliamentary Hi&s;tory, vol. i. p. 473. That this confe&s;&s;ion was genuine, and obtained without violence, may be entirely depended on. Judge Rickhill, who brought it over from Calais, was tried on that account, and acquitted in the fir&s;t parliament of Henry IV. when Gloce&s;ter's party was prevalent. His acquittal, notwith&s;tanding his innocence, may even appear marvellous, con&s;idering the times. See Cotton, p. 393.</NOTE>: But it is rea&s;on|able
to think, that his &s;chemes were not &s;o far advanced
as to make him think of their immediate execution. The
danger, probably, was &s;till too di&s;tant to render a de&s;pe|rate
remedy entirely nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ecurity of the go|vernment.</P>
<P>BUT whatever opinion we may form of Gloce&s;ter's
con&s;piracies, his aver&s;ion to the French truce and alliance
was public and avowed; and that court, which had now
a great influence over the King, pu&s;hed him to provide
for his own &s;afety, by taking revenge of the dangerous
de&s;igns of his uncle. The re&s;entment of his former vio|lences
revived; the &s;en&s;e of his refractory and uncom|pliant
behaviour was &s;till recent; and a man, who&s;e am|bition
had once u&s;urped royal authority, and who had
murdered all the faithful &s;ervants of the King, was
thought capable, on a favourable opportunity, of renew|ing
the &s;ame trea&s;onable enterprizes. The King's pre|cipitate
temper admitted of no deliberation: He ordered
<PB N="32" REF="40">
Gloce&s;ter to be unexpectedly arre&s;ted; to be hurried into
a &s;hip which was lying in the river; and to be carried
over to Calais, where alone, he thought, that, by rea&s;on
of his numerous partizans, he could &s;afely be detained
in cu&s;tody<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 4. chap. 90. Wal&s;ing. p. 354.</NOTE>. The earls of Arundel and Warwic were

<P>A PARLIAMENT was immediately &s;ummoned at We&s;t|min&s;ter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th Sept.</NOTE>
and the King doubted not to find the peers,
and &s;till more the commons, very compliant with his
will. This hou&s;e had in a former parliament given him
very &s;en&s;ible proofs of their obedience<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">In the former parliament, the commons had &s;hewn them&s;elves in a di&s;po&s;ition to be very complai&s;ant to the King; yet there happened an incident in their proceedings, which is very curious, and &s;hews us the &s;tate of the hou&s;e in that period. The members were either country gentlemen, or merchants, who were a&s;&s;embled for a few days, and were entirely unacquainted with bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o that it was ea&s;y to lead them a&s;tray, and draw them into votes and re&s;olutions very different from their &s;ettled purpo&s;e. A member had propo&s;ed &s;ome petitions concern|ing the &s;tate of the nation; in which, among other things, the hou&s;e recommended f$$gality to the King, and for that purpo&s;e, de&s;ired, that the court &s;hould not be &s;o much frequented as formerly with <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>ladies.</HI> The King was di&s;plea&s;ed with this freedom: The commons very humbly craved pardon: He was not &s;atisfied unle&s;s they would name the mover of that petition. It happened to be one Haxey, whom the parliament, in order to make atonement, condemned for this offence to die the death of a traitor. But the King, at the de&s;ire of the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and the prelates, pardoned him. When a parliament in tho&s;e times, not agitated by any faction, and being at entire freedom, could be guilty of &s;uch mon&s;trous extrava|gance, it is ea&s;y to judge what might be expected from them in more trying &s;ituations. See Cotton's Abridg. p. 361, 362.</NOTE>; and the pre&s;ent
<PB N="33" REF="41">
&s;uppre&s;&s;ion of Gloce&s;ter's party made him &s;till more a&s;|&s;ured
of a favourable election. As a farther expedient
for that purpo&s;e, he is al&s;o &s;aid to have employed the
influence of the &s;heriffs; a practice which, as it was
then &s;omewhat new, gave great umbrage, but which the
e&s;tabli&s;hed authority of that a&s;&s;embly rendered afterwards
more familiar to the nation. Accordingly, the parlia|ment
pa&s;&s;ed whatever acts the King was plea&s;ed to
dictate to them<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">The nobles brought numerous retainers with them to give them &s;ecurity, as we are told by Wal&s;ingham, p. 354. The King had a few Che&s;hire men for his guard.</NOTE>: They annulled forever the commi&s;&s;ion
which u&s;urped upon the royal authority, and declared it
trea&s;onable to attempt, in any future period, the revival
of any &s;imilar commi&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Statutes at large, 21 Richard II.</NOTE>: They abrogated all the acts,
which attainted the King's mini&s;ters, and which that
parliament who pa&s;&s;ed them, and the whole nation, had
&s;worn inviolably to maintain: And they declared the
general pardon then granted to be invalid, as extorted by
force, and never ratified by the free con&s;ent of the King.
Tho' Richard, after he re&s;umed the government, and lay
no longer under con&s;traint, had voluntarily, by procla|mation,
confirmed that general indemnity; this circum|&s;tance
&s;eemed not, in their eyes, to merit the lea&s;t con|&s;ideration.
Even a particular pardon granted &s;ix years
after to the earl of Arundel, was annulled by par|liament;
on pretence, that it was procured by &s;urprize,
and that the King was not then acquainted with the de|gree
of guilt incurred by that nobleman.</P>
<P>THE commons then entered an impeachment again&s;t
Fitz-Alan, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and brother to
Arundel, and accu&s;ed him of his concurrence in pro|curing
<PB N="34" REF="42">
the illegal commi&s;&s;ion, and in attainting the
King's mini&s;ters. The primate pleaded guilty; but as
he was protected by the eccle&s;ia&s;tical privileges, the
King was &s;atisfied with a &s;entence, which bani&s;hed him
the kingdom, and &s;eque&s;tered his temporalities<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 368.</NOTE>. An
appeal or accu&s;ation was pre&s;ented again&s;t the duke of
Gloce&s;ter, and the earls of Arundel and Warwic, by
the earls of Rutland, Kent, Huntington, Somer&s;et, Sa|li&s;bury,
and Nottingham, together with the lords Spen|cer
and Scrope, and they were accu&s;ed of the &s;ame
crimes which had been imputed to the archbi&s;hop, as
well as of their appearance again&s;t the King in a
ho&s;tile manner at Haringay-park. The earl of Arundel,
who was brought to the bar, very wi&s;ely confined all
his defence to the pleading both the general and parti|cular
pardon of the King; but was over-ruled, con|demned
and executed<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 377. Froi&s;&s;art, liv. 4. chap. 90. Wal&s;ing. p. 354.</NOTE>. The earl of Warwic, who
was al&s;o convicted of high trea&s;on, was, on account of
his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive behaviour, pardoned as to his life, but
doomed to perpetual bani&s;hment in the I&s;le of Man.
No new acts of trea&s;on were imputed to either of the&s;e
noblemen. The only crimes, for which they were con|demned,
were the old attempts again&s;t the crown, which
&s;eemed to be obliterated, both by the di&s;tance of time,
and by repeated pardons<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Tyrrel, vol. iii. part 2. p. 968. from the records.</NOTE>. The rea&s;ons of this method
of proceeding, it is difficult to conjecture. The recent
con&s;piracies of Gloce&s;ter &s;eem certain from his own
con&s;e&s;&s;ion: But perhaps, the King and mini&s;try had
not, at that time, in their hands, any &s;atisfactory proof
of their reality; perhaps, it was difficult to convict Arun|del
and Warwic, of any concurrence in them; perhaps,
an enquiry into the&s;e con&s;piracies would have involved in
the guilt &s;ome of tho&s;e great noblemen, who now con|curred
<PB N="35" REF="43">
with the crown, and whom it was nece&s;&s;ary to co|ver
from all imputation; or perhaps, the King, according
to the genius of that age, was very indifferent about
&s;aving even the appearances of ju&s;tice and equity, and
was only &s;olicitous by any means to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s in the&s;e
pro&s;ecutions. This point, like many others in antient
hi&s;tory, we are obliged to leave altogether undetermined.</P>
<P>A WARRANT was i&s;&s;ued to the earl Mare&s;chal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of the duke of Gloce&s;ter.</NOTE> go|vernor
of Calais, to bring over the duke of Gloce&s;ter,
in order to his trial; but the governor returned for an|&s;wer,
that the duke had died &s;uddenly of an apoplexy
in that fortre&s;s. Nothing could be more &s;u&s;picious than
the time of that prince's death: It became immediately
the general opinion, that he was murdered by orders
from his nephew: In the &s;ub&s;equent reign undoubted
proofs were produced to parliament, that he had been
&s;uffocated with pillows by his keepers<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 399, 400. Dugdale, vol. ii. p. 171.</NOTE>: And it appeared,
that the King, apprehen&s;ive le&s;t the public trial and exe|cution
of &s;o popular a prince, and &s;o near a relation,
might prove both dangerous and invidious, had taken
this ba&s;e method of gratifying, and as he &s;ancied, con|cealing
his revenge upon him. Both parties, in their
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive triumphs, &s;eem to have had no farther con|cern
than that of retaliating upon their adver&s;aries;
and neither of them were aware, that, in imitating,
they indirectly ju&s;tified, as far as it lay in their power,
all the illegal violences of the oppo&s;ite party.</P>
<P>THIS &s;e&s;&s;ion concluded with the creation or advance|ment
of &s;everal peers; the earl of Derby was made
duke of Hereford; the earl of Rutland, duke of Albe|marle;
the earl of Kent, duke of Surrey; the earl of

which each party requires for the &s;ecurity of the pre|&s;ent

<P>THE parliament, before they were di&s;&s;olved, elected
a committee of twelve lords and &s;ix commoners<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The names of the commi&s;&s;ioners were the dukes of Lanca&s;ter, York, Albemarle, Surrey, and Exeter, the marquis of Dor&s;et, the earls of March, Sali&s;bury, Northumberland, Gloce&s;ter, Winche&s;ter, and Wilt|&s;hire, John Bu&s;&s;ey, Henry Green, John Ru&s;&s;el, Robert Teye, Henry Chelme&s;wike, and John Golo$re. It is to be remarked, that the duke of Lanca&s;ter always concurred with the re&s;t in all their proceedings, even in the bani&s;hment of his &s;on, which was afterwards &s;o much com|plained of.</NOTE>, whom
they ve&s;ted with the whole power both of lords and com|mons,
and endowed with full authority to fini&s;h all bu|&s;ine&s;s,
which had been laid before the hou&s;es, and which
they had not had lei&s;ure to bring to a conclu&s;ion<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 372. Wal&s;ingham, p. 355.</NOTE>. This
was a very unu&s;ual conce&s;&s;ion; and tho' it was limited
in the object, might, either immediately or as a prece|dent,
have proved dangerous to the con&s;titution: But
the cau&s;e of that extraordinary mea&s;ure was an event very
&s;ingular and unexpected, which engaged the attention
of the parliament.</P>
<P>AFTER the de&s;truction of the duke of Gloce&s;ter and
the heads of that party, a mi&s;under&s;tanding broke out
among tho&s;e noblemen, who had joined in the pro&s;ecu|tion;
and the King wanted either authority &s;ufficient to
appea&s;e it, or fore&s;ight to prevent it. The duke of
Hereford appeared in parliament, and accu&s;ed the duke
of Norfolk of having &s;poke to him, in private, many &s;lan|derous
words of the King, and of having imputed to his
maje&s;ty an intention of &s;ubverting and de&s;troying many
of his principal nobility<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 372. Parliamentary hi&s;tory, vol. i. p. 490.</NOTE>. Norfolk denied the charge,
<PB N="38" REF="46">
gave Hereford the lie, and offered to prove his inno|cence
by duel. The challenge was accepted: The time
and place of combat were appointed: And as the event
of this important trial by arms might require the inter|po&s;ition
of legi&s;lative authority, the parliament thought
it more &s;uitable to delegate their power to a committee,
than to prolong the &s;e&s;&s;ion beyond the u&s;ual time, which
cu&s;tom and general convenience had pre&s;cribed to it<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">In the fir&s;t year of Henry VI. when the authority of parliament was great, and when that a&s;&s;embly could lea&s;t be &s;u&s;pected of lying un|der violence, a like conce&s;&s;ion was made to the council from like mo|tives of convenience. See Cotton, p. 564.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Hereford was certainly very little deli|cate
in the point of honour, to betray a private conver&s;a|tion
to the ruin of the per&s;on who had entru&s;ted him; and
we may thence be more inclined to believe the duke of
Norfolk's denial, than the other's a&s;&s;everation. But
Norfolk had in the&s;e tran&s;actions betrayed an equal
neglect of honour, which brings him entirely to a level
with his antagoni&s;t. Tho' he had publickly joined with
the duke of Gloce&s;ter and that party in all the former
violences put upon the King; and his name &s;tands
among the appellants who accu&s;ed the duke of Ireland
and the other mini&s;ters: Yet was he not a&s;hamed
publickly to impeach his former a&s;&s;ociates for the very
crimes, which he had concurred with them in commit|ting,
and his name encrea&s;es the li&s;t of tho&s;e appellants
who brought them to a trial. Such were the principles
and practices of tho&s;e antient knights and barons during
the prevalence of the feudal government, and the reign
of chivalry.</P>
<P>THE li&s;ts for this deci&s;ion of truth and right were ap|pointed
at Coventry before the King: All the nobility
of England bandied into parties, and adhered either to
the one duke or the other: The whole nation was held
<PB N="39" REF="47">
in &s;u&s;pence with regard to the event: But when the two
champions appeared in the field, accoutered for the
combat, the King interpo&s;ed to prevent, both the pre|&s;ent
effu&s;ion of &s;uch noble blood, and the future con&s;e|quences
of the quarrel. By the advice and authority of
the parliamentary commi&s;&s;ioners, he &s;topped the duel;
and to &s;how his impartiality, he ordered, by the &s;ame au|thority, both the combatants to leave the kingdom<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 380. Wal&s;ingham, p. 356.</NOTE>, a&s;|&s;igning
one country for the place of Norfolk's exile,
which he declared perpetual, and another for that of
Hereford, which he limited to ten years.</P>
<P>HEREFORD was a man of great prudence and command
of temper; and he behaved him&s;elf with &s;o much &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
in the&s;e delicate circum&s;tances, that the King,
before his departure, promi&s;ed to &s;horten the term of his
exile four years; and he al&s;o granted him letters patent,
by which he was empowered, in ca&s;e any inheritance
&s;hould in the mean time fall to him, to enter imme|diately
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and to po&s;tpone the doing homage

affair.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bani&s;hment of Henry duke of Hereford.</NOTE> No &s;ooner had Henry left the kingdom, than

But Richard, afraid of &s;trengthening the hands of a man,

parliamentary commi&s;&s;ioners, and per&s;uaded them that
this affair was but an appendage of that bu&s;ine&s;s,
which the parliament had delegated to them. By
their authority, he revoked his letters patent, and re|tained
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate of Lanca&s;ter: And by the
&s;ame authority, he &s;eized and tried the duke's attorney,

in York&s;hire; and was immediately joined by the earls
of Northumberland and We&s;tmoreland, two of the mo&s;t
potent barons in England. He here took a &s;olemn oath,
that he had no other purpo&s;e in this inva&s;ion, than to
recover the dutchy of Lanca&s;ter, unju&s;tly detained from
him; and he invited all his friends in England, and all
lovers of their country, to &s;econd him in this rea&s;onable
and moderate preten&s;ion. Every place was in commo|tion:
The malecontents in all quarters flew to arms:

to mutiny and rebellion: And Henry's army, en|crea&s;ing
on every day's march, &s;oon amounted to the
number of 60,000 men.</P>
<P>THE duke of York was left guardian of the realm;<NOTE PLACE="marg">General in|&s;urrection.</NOTE> a
place to which his birth intitled him, but which both his
&s;lender abilities, and his natural connexions with the duke
of Lanca&s;ter, rendered him utterly incapable of filling in
&s;uch a dangerous emergency. All the chief nobility,
who were attached to the crown, and who could either
have &s;econded the guardian's good intentions, or have
overawed his infidelity, had attended the King into Ire|land;
and the efforts of Richard's friends were every
where more feeble than tho&s;e of his enemies. The duke
of York, however, appointed the rendezvous of his
forces at St. Albans, and &s;oon a&s;&s;embled an army of
40,000 men; but found them entirely de&s;titute of zeal
and attachment to the royal cau&s;e, and more inclined to
join the party of the rebels. He hearkened therefore
very readily to a me&s;&s;age from Henry, who entreated
him not to oppo&s;e a loyal and humble &s;upplicant in the
recovery of his legal patrimony; and the guardian even
declared publickly that he would &s;econd his nephew in &s;o
rea&s;onable a reque&s;t. His army, embraced with accla|mations
the &s;ame party; and the duke of Lanca&s;ter, re|inforced
by their numbers, was now intirely ma&s;ter of
the kingdom. He ha&s;tened to Bri&s;tol, into which &s;ome
of the King's mini&s;ters had thrown them&s;elves; and &s;oon
obliging that place to &s;urrender, he yielded to the cries
of the populace, and without giving them a trial, order|ed
the earl of Wilt&s;hire, Sir John Bu&s;&s;y, and Sir Henry
Green, whom he there took pri&s;oners, to be led out to
immediate execution.</P>
<P>THE King, receiving intelligence of this inva&s;ion
and in&s;urrection, ha&s;tened over from Ireland, and landed
in Milford Haven with a body of 20,000 men: But

even this army, &s;o much inferior to the enemy, were
either overawed by the general combination of the king|dom,
or &s;eized with the &s;ame &s;pirit of rebellion; and
they gradually de&s;erted him, till he found that he had
not above 6000 men, who followed his &s;tandard. It ap|peared,
therefore, nece&s;&s;ary to retire &s;ecretly from this
&s;mall body, which &s;erved only to expo&s;e him to danger;
and he fled to the i&s;le of Angle&s;ea, where he purpo&s;ed to
embark either for Ireland or France, and there await
the favourable opportunities, which the return of his
&s;ubjects to a &s;en&s;e of duty, or their future di&s;contents
again&s;t the duke of Lanca&s;ter, would probably afford him.
Henry, &s;en&s;ible of this danger, &s;ent to him the earl of
Northumberland with the &s;tronge&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of loyalty
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and that nobleman, by treachery and
fal&s;e oaths, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the King's per&s;on,
and carried him to his enemy at Flint Ca&s;tle. Richard
was conducted to London,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t Septr.</NOTE> by the duke of Lanca&s;ter,
who was there received with the acclamations of the mu|tinous
populace. It is pretended, that the recorder met
him on the road; and in the name of the city, entreated
him, for the public &s;afety, to put Richard to death, with
all his adherents who were pri&s;oners<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham.</NOTE>; but the duke
very prudently determined to make many others par|ticipate
of his guilt, before he would proceed to tho&s;e
extremities. For this purpo&s;e, he i&s;&s;ued writs of elec|tion
in the King's name, and appointed the immediate
meeting of a parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>
<P>SUCH of the peers, as were the mo&s;t devoted to the
King, were either fled or impri&s;oned; and no opponents,
even among the barons, dared to appear again&s;t Henry
amid that &s;cene of outrage and violence, which com|monly
attends revolutions, more e&s;pecially in England
during tho&s;e turbulent ages: And it is al&s;o ea&s;y to ima|gine,
<PB N="44" REF="52">
that a hou&s;e of commons, elected during this uni|ver&s;al
&s;erment, and this triumph of the Lanca&s;trian
Party, would be extremely attached to that cau&s;e, and
ready to &s;econd every &s;ugge&s;tion of their leader. That
order, being as yet of too little weight to &s;tem the tor|rent,
was always carried along with it, and &s;erved only
to encrea&s;e the violence, which the public intere&s;t re|quired
it &s;hould endeavour to controul. The duke of
Lanca&s;ter therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Depo&s;ition of the King.</NOTE>, &s;en&s;ible that he would be entirely
ma&s;ter, began to carry his views to the crown it&s;elf; and
he deliberated with his partizans concerning the mo&s;t
proper means of effecting his violent purpo&s;e. He fir&s;t
extorted a re&s;ignation from Richard<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2744. Otterbourne. p. 212.</NOTE>; but as he knew,
that that deed would plainly appear the re&s;ult of force and
fear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th Sept.</NOTE> he al&s;o propo&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding the danger of the
precedent to him&s;elf and his po&s;terity, to have him &s;o|lemnly
depo&s;ed in parliament for his pretended tyranny
and mi&s;conduct. A charge, con&s;i&s;ting of thirty-three
articles, was accordingly drawn up again&s;t him, and pre|&s;ented
to that a&s;&s;embly<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Tyrrel, vol. iii. part 2. p. 1008, from the records. Knyghton, p. 2746. Otterbourne, p. 214.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF we examine the&s;e articles, which are expre&s;&s;ed with
extreme acrimony again&s;t Richard, we &s;hall find, that,
except &s;ome ra&s;h &s;peeches, which are imputed to him<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Art. 15. 26.</NOTE>,
and of who&s;e reality, as they are &s;aid to have pa&s;&s;ed in
private conver&s;ation, we may very rea&s;onably entertain
&s;ome doubt; the chief amount of the charge is contained
in his violent conduct during the two la&s;t years of his
reign, and naturally divides it&s;elf into two principal heads.
The fir&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable is the revenge, which he
took on the princes and great barons, who had formerly
u&s;urped, and &s;till per&s;evered in controuling and threat|ning
<PB N="45" REF="53">
his authority; the &s;econd is the violation of the
laws and general privileges of his people. But the for|mer,
however irregular in many of its circum&s;tances, was
fully &s;upported by authority of parliament, and was but
a copy of the violence, which the princes and barons
them&s;elves, during their former triumph, had exerci&s;ed
again&s;t him and his party. The detention of Lanca&s;ter's
e&s;tate was, properly &s;peaking, a revocation, by the ap|pearance
at lea&s;t of parliamentary authority, of a grace,
which the King him&s;elf had formerly granted him. The
murder of Gloce&s;ter (for the &s;ecret execution, however
merited, of that prince, certainly de&s;erves this appellation)
was a private deed, formed not any precedent, and
implied not any a&s;&s;umed or arbitrary power of the
crown, which could ju&s;tly give umbrage to the people.
It was really the effect of the King's weakne&s;s, rather
than ambition; and proves, that, in&s;tead of being dan|gerous
to the con&s;titution, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not even the au|thority
requi&s;ite for the execution of the laws.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd head of accu&s;ation, as it con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly
of general facts, was framed by Richard's inveterate
enemies, and was never allowed to be an&s;wered by him
or his friends; it is more difficult to form a judgment
of. The greate&s;t part of the&s;e grievances, objected to
Richard, &s;eems to be the exertion of arbitrary preroga|tives;
&s;uch as the di&s;pen&s;ing power<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Art. 13. 17, 18.</NOTE>, levying purvey|ance<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Art, 22.</NOTE>, employing the mar&s;hal's court<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Art. 27.</NOTE>, extorting loans<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Art. 14.</NOTE>,
granting protections from law-&s;uits<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Art. 16.</NOTE>; prerogatives,
which, though often complained of, had often been exer|ci&s;ed
by his predece&s;&s;ors, and &s;till continued to be &s;o by
his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. But whether his irregular acts of this
kind were more frequent and injudicious and violent than
u&s;ual, or were only laid hold of and more exaggerated,
<PB N="46" REF="54">
by the factions, to which the weakne&s;s of his reign had
given birth, we are not able at this di&s;tance to determine
with certainty. There is however one circum&s;tance, in
which his conduct is vi&s;ibly different from that of his
grandfather: He is not accu&s;ed of having impo&s;ed one
arbitrary tax, without con&s;ent of parliament, during his
whole reign<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">We learn from Cotton, p. 362. that the King, by his chancellor, told the commons, <HI>that they were &s;underly bound to him, and namely in for|bearing to charge them with $$$&s;ines and fifteens, the which he meant</HI> no more <HI>to charge them in his own per&s;on.</HI> The&s;e words <HI>no more</HI> allude to the prac|tice of his predece&s;&s;ors: He had not him&s;elf impo&s;ed any arbitrary taxes: Even the parliament, in the articles of his depo&s;ition, tho they complain of heavy taxes, affirm not, that they were impo&s;ed ille|gally or by arbitrary will.</NOTE>: Scarce a year pa&s;&s;ed during the reign of
Edward, which was free from complaints with regard to
this grievous and dangerous exertion of authority. But,
perhaps, the great a&s;cendant, which Edward had ac|quired
over his people, together with his great prudence,
enabled him to make a u&s;e very advantageous to his &s;ub|jects
of this and other arbitrary prerogatives, and ren|dered
them a &s;maller grievance in his hands, than a le&s;s
ab&s;olute authority in tho&s;e of his grand&s;on. This is a
point, which it would be ra&s;h for us to decide po&s;itively
on either &s;ide; but it is certain, that a charge drawn
up by the duke of Lanca&s;ter, and a&s;&s;ented to by a par|liament,
&s;ituated in the&s;e circum&s;tances, forms no man|ner
of pre&s;umption with regard to the unu&s;ual irregula|rity
or violence of the King's conduct in this parti|cular<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">To &s;how how little credit is to be given to this charge again&s;t Ri|chard, we may ob&s;erve, that a law in the 13 Edw. III. had been made again&s;t the continuance of &s;heriffs for more than one year: But the inconvenience of changes having afterwards appeared from expe|rience, the commons in the twentieth of this King, applied by petition that the &s;heriffs might be continued; tho' that petition had not been enacted into a &s;tatute, by rea&s;on of other di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances, which attended it. See Cotton, p. 361. It was certainly a very mo|derate exerci&s;e of the di&s;pen&s;ing power for the king to continue the &s;heriffs, after he found that that practice would be acceptable to his &s;ubjects, and had been applied for by one hou&s;e of parliament: Yet is this made an article of charge again&s;t him by the pre&s;ent parliament. See art. 18. Wal&s;ingham, &s;peaking of a period early in Richard's mi|nority, &s;ays, <HI>But what do acts of parliament &s;ignify, when, after they are made, they take no effect; &s;ince the King, by the advice of the privy-council, takes upon him to alter, or wholly &s;et a&s;ide, all tho&s;e things, which by general con&s;ent had been ordained in parliament?</HI> If Richard, therefore, exerci&s;ed the di&s;pen&s;ing power, he was warranted by the examples of his uncles and grandfather, and indeed of all his predece&s;&s;ors from Henry III.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN the charge again&s;t Richard was pre&s;ented to
the parliament, tho' it was liable, almo&s;t in every article,
<PB N="47" REF="55">
to objections, it was not canva&s;&s;ed, nor examined, nor
di&s;puted in either hou&s;e, and &s;eemed to be received with
unanimous approbation. One man alone, the bi&s;hop of
Carli&s;le, had the courage, amid&s;t this univer&s;al di&s;loyalty
and violence, to appear in defence of his unhappy ma|&s;ter,
and to plead his cau&s;e again&s;t all the power of the
prevailing party. Tho' &s;ome topics, employed by that
virtuous prelate, may &s;eem to favour too much the doc|trine
of pa&s;&s;ive obedience, and to make too large a &s;a|crifice
of the rights of mankind; he was naturally pu&s;h|ed
into that extreme by his abhorrence of the pre&s;ent li|centious
factions; and &s;uch intrepidity, as well as di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s
of behaviour, proves, that, whatever his
&s;peculative principles were, his heart was elevated far
above the meanne&s;s and abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of a &s;lave. He
repre&s;ented to the parliament, that all the abu&s;es of go|vernment,
which could ju&s;tly be imputed to Richard,
far from amounting to tyranny, were merely the re&s;ult
of error, youth, or mi&s;guided council, and admitted of
a remedy, more ea&s;y and &s;aluta$ than a total fubver&s;ion
of the con&s;titution. That even had they been much more
violent and dangerous, than they really were, they had
chieflly proceeded from former examples of re&s;i&s;tance,
<PB N="48" REF="56">
which, making the prince &s;en&s;ible of his precarious &s;itua|tion,
had obliged him to e&s;tabli&s;h his throne by irregular
and arbitrary expedients. That a rebellious di&s;po&s;ition in
&s;ubjects was the principal cau&s;e of tyranny in Kings: Laws
could never &s;ecure the &s;ubject, which did not give &s;ecu|rity
to the &s;overeign: And if the maxim of inviolable
loyalty, which formed the ba&s;is of the Engli&s;h govern|ment,
were once rejected, the privileges, belonging to
the &s;everal orders of the &s;tate, in&s;tead of being fortified
by that licentiou&s;ne&s;s, would thereby lo&s;e the &s;ure&s;t foun|dation
of their force and ftability. That the parliamen|tary
depo&s;ition of Edward II. far from making a pre|cedent,
which could controul this maxim, was only the
example of &s;ucce&s;sful violence; and it was &s;ufficiently
to be lamented, that crimes were &s;o often committed in
the world, without e&s;tabli&s;hing principles which might
ju&s;tify and authorize them. That even that precedent,
fal&s;e and dangerous as it was, could never warrant the
pre&s;ent exce&s;&s;es, which were &s;o much greater, and which
would entail di&s;traction and mi&s;ery on the nation, to
their late&s;t po&s;terity. That the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, at lea&s;t, of
the crown, was then pre&s;erved inviolate: The lineal
heir was placed on the throne: And the people had an
opportunity, by their legal obedience to him, of making
atonement for the violences which they had committed
again&s;t his predece&s;&s;or. That a de&s;cendant of Lionel,
duke of Clarence, the elder brother of the late duke of
Lanca&s;ter, had been declared in parliament &s;ucce&s;&s;or
to the crown: He had left po&s;terity: And their title,
however it might be overpowered by pre&s;ent force and
&s;action, could never be obliterated from the minds of the
people. That if the turbulent di&s;po&s;ition alone of the
nation, had overturned the well-e&s;tabli&s;hed throne of &s;o
good a prince as Richard; what bloody commotions
mu&s;t en&s;ue, when the &s;ame cau&s;e was united to the mo|tive
of re&s;toring the legal and undoubted heir to his
<PB N="49" REF="57">
authority? That the new government, intended to be
e&s;tabli&s;hed, would &s;tand on no principles; and would
&s;carce retain any pretence, by which it could challenge
the obedience of men of &s;en&s;e or virtue. That the claim
of lineal de&s;cent was &s;o gro&s;s as &s;carcely to deceive the
mo&s;t ignorant of the populace: Conque&s;t could never
be pleaded by a rebel again&s;t his &s;overeign: The con|&s;ent
of the people had no authority in a monarchy not
derived from con&s;ent, but e&s;tabli&s;hed by hereditary right;
and however the nation might be ju&s;tified, in depo&s;ing
the mi&s;guided Richard, it could never have any rea&s;on
for pa&s;&s;ing by his lawful heir and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who was
plainly innocent. And that the duke of Lanca&s;ter
would give them but a bad &s;pecimen of the legal mode|ration,
which might be expected from his future go|vernment,
if he added, to the crime of his pa&s;t rebellion,
the guilt of excluding the family, which, both by right
of blood, and by declaration of parliament, would, in
ca&s;e of Richard's decea&s;e, or voluntary re&s;ignation, have
been received as the undoubted heirs of the mo|narchy<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Sir John Heywarde, p. 101.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL the circum&s;tances of this event, compared to
tho&s;e attending the late revolution in 1688, &s;how the
difference between a great and civilized nation, delibe|rately
vindicating its e&s;tabli&s;hed privileges, and a tur|bulent
and barbarous ari&s;tocracy, plunging headlong
from the extremities of one faction into tho&s;e of an|other.
This noble freedom of the bi&s;hop of Carli&s;le,
in&s;tead of being applauded, was not &s;o much as to|lerated:
He was immediately arre&s;ted, by orders of the
duke of Lanca&s;ter, and &s;ent a pri&s;oner to the abbey of
St. Albans. No farther debate was attempted: Thirty|three
long articles of charge were, in one meeting, voted
<PB N="50" REF="58">
again&s;t Richard; and voted unanimou&s;ly by the &s;ame
peers and prelates, who, a little before, had voluntarily
and unanimou&s;ly authorized tho&s;e very acts of violence,
of which they now complained. That prince was de|po&s;ed
by the &s;uffrages of both hou&s;es; and the throne
being now vacant, the duke of Lanca&s;ter &s;tepped forth,
and having cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf on his forehead, and on his
brea&s;t, and called upon the name of Chri&s;t<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 389.</NOTE>, he pro|nounced
the&s;e words, which we &s;hall give in the original
language, becau&s;e of their &s;ingularity.</P>
<P>In the name of Fadher, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, I Henry

<P>IN order to under&s;tand this &s;peech, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved,
that there was a &s;illy &s;tory, received among &s;ome of the
lowe&s;t vulgar, that Edmond earl of Lanca&s;ter, &s;on of
Henry III. was really the elder brother of Edward I;
but that, by rea&s;on of &s;ome deformities in his per&s;on, he
had been po&s;tponed in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and his younger
brother impo&s;ed on the nation in his &s;tead. As the pre|&s;ent
duke of Lanca&s;ter inherited from Edmond by his mo|ther,
this genealogy made him the true heir of the mo|narchy;
and it is therefore in&s;inuated in Henry's &s;peech:
But the ab&s;urdity was too gro&s;s to be openly avowed ei|ther
by him, or by the parliament. The ca&s;e is the
&s;ame with regard to his right of conque&s;t: He was a
&s;ubject who rebelled again&s;t his &s;overeign: He entered
the kingdom with a retinue of no more than &s;ixty per|&s;ons:
<PB N="51" REF="59">
He could not therefore be the conqueror of Eng|land;
and this right is accordingly in&s;inuated, not avowed.
Still there is a third claim, derived from his merits in
&s;aving the nation from tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion; and this
claim is al&s;o in&s;inuated: But as it &s;eemed, by its nature,
better calculated as a rea&s;on for his being <HI>elected</HI> King by
a free choice, which he was determined never to avow,
than for giving him an immediate right of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he
dur&s;t not &s;peak openly even on this head; and to obviate
any notion of election, he challenges the crown as his due,
either by acqui&s;ition or inheritance. The whole forms
&s;uch a piece of jargon and non&s;en&s;e, as is almo&s;t with|out
example: No objection however was made to it in
the parliament: The unanimous voice of lords and com|mons
placed Henry on the throne: He became King,
nobody could tell how or wherefore: The title of the
hou&s;e of Marche, formerly recognized by parliament,
was neither invalidated nor repealed; but pa&s;&s;ed over in
total &s;ilence: And as a concern for the liberties of the
people &s;eems to have had no hand in this revolution,
their right to di&s;po&s;e of the government, as well as all
their other privileges, was left preci&s;ely on the &s;ame foot|ing
as before. But Henry, having, when he claimed the
crown, dropped &s;ome ob&s;cure hint concerning conque&s;t,

<P>THE &s;ub&s;equent events di&s;cover the &s;ame headlong
violence of conduct,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th oct.</NOTE> and the &s;ame rude notions of civil
government. The depo&s;ition of Richard di&s;&s;olved the
parliament: It was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ummon a new one:
<PB N="52" REF="60">
And Henry, in &s;ix days after, called together, without
any new election, the &s;ame members; and this a&s;&s;embly
he denominated a new parliament. They were employed
in the u&s;ual ta&s;k of rever&s;ing every deed of the oppo&s;ite
party. All the acts of the la&s;t parliament of Richard,
which had been confirmed by their oaths, and by a
papal bull, were abrogated: All the acts, which had
pa&s;&s;ed in the parliament where Gloce&s;ter prevailed, and
which had been abrogated by Richard, were again re|e&s;tabli&s;hed<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 390.</NOTE>: The an&s;wers of Tre&s;illian, and the other
judges, which a parliament had annulled, but which
a new parliament and new judges had approved, here re|ceived
a &s;econd condemnation. The peers, who had ac|cu&s;ed
Gloce&s;ter, Arundel, and Warwic, and who had
received higher titles for that piece of &s;ervice, were all of
them degraded from their new dignities: Even the prac|tice
of pro&s;ecuting appeals in parliament was wholly abo|li&s;hed;
and trials were re&s;tored to the cour&s;e of common
law<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Henry iv. cap. 14.</NOTE>. The natural effect of this conduct was to render
the people giddy with &s;uch rapid and perpetual changes,
and to make them lo&s;e all notions of right and wrong
in the mea&s;ures of government.</P>
<P>THE earl of Northumberland made a motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d Oct.</NOTE> in the
hou&s;e of peers, with regard to the unhappy prince whom
they had depo&s;ed. He a&s;ked them, what advice they
would give the King for the future treatment of him;
&s;ince Henry was re&s;olved to &s;pare his life. They unani|mou&s;ly
replied, that he &s;hould be impri&s;oned under a &s;ecure
guard, in &s;ome &s;ecret place, and &s;hould be deprived of all
commerce with any of his friends or partizans. It was
ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that he would not remain long alive in
the hands of &s;uch barbarous and &s;anguinary enemies.
Hi&s;torians differ with regard to the manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of the King.</NOTE>, in which he
<PB N="53" REF="61">
was murdered. It was long the prevailing opinion, that
Sir Piers Exton, and others of his guards, fell upon him
in the ca&s;tle of Pomfret, where he was confined, and di&s;|patched
him with their halberts. But it is more probable,
that he was &s;tarved to death in pri&s;on; and after all &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence
was denied him, he prolonged his unhappy life,
it is &s;aid, for a fortnight, before he reached the end of
his mi&s;eries. This account is more con&s;i&s;tent with the
&s;tory, that his body was expo&s;ed in public, and that no
marks of violence were ob&s;erved upon it. He died in
the thirty-fourth year of his age, and the twenty-third of
his reign. He left no po&s;terity, either legitimate or ille|gitimate.</P>
<P>ALL the writers, who have tran&s;mitted to us the hi|&s;|tory
of Richard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His charac|ter.</NOTE> compo&s;ed their works during the reigns
of the Lanca&s;trian princes; and candor requires, that we
&s;hould not give entire credit to the reproaches which have
been thrown upon his memory. But after making all
proper abatements, he &s;till appears to have been a weak
prince, and unfit for government, le&s;s for want of na|tural
parts and capacity, than of &s;olid judgment and a
good education. He was violent in his temper, profu&s;e
in his expences; fond of idle &s;how and magnificence;
devoted to favourites, and addicted to plea&s;ure: Pa&s;&s;ions,
all of them, the mo&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent with a prudent oeco|nomy,
and con&s;equently dangerous in a limited and
mixed government. Had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the talents of gain|ing,
and &s;till more tho&s;e of over-awing, his great barons,
he might have e&s;caped all the misfortunes of his reign,
and been allowed to carry much farther his oppre&s;&s;ions
over the people, if he really was guilty of any, without
their daring to rebel, or even to murmur again&s;t him.
But when the grandees were tempted, by his want of
prudence and of vigour, to re&s;i&s;t his authority, and execute
the mo&s;t violent enterprizes upon him, he was naturally
<PB N="54" REF="62">
led to &s;eek for an opportunity of retaliation; ju&s;tice was
neglected; the lives of the chief nobility &s;acrificed; and
all the&s;e evils &s;eem to have proceeded le&s;s from a &s;ettled
de&s;ign of e&s;tabli&s;hing arbitrary power, than from the in|&s;olence
of victory, and the nece&s;&s;ities of the King's &s;itua|tion.
The manners indeed of the age were the chief
&s;ource of &s;uch violences: Laws, which were feebly exe|cuted
in peaceable times, lo&s;t all their authority during
public convul&s;ions: Both parties were alike guilty: Or
if any difference may be remarked between them, we
&s;hall find, that the authority of the crown, being more
legal, was commonly carried, when it prevailed, to le&s;s
de&s;perate extremities, than tho&s;e of the ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>ON comparing the conduct and events of this reign,
with tho&s;e of the preceding, we &s;hall find equal rea&s;on
to admire Edward, and to blame Richard; but the cir|cum&s;tance
of oppo&s;ition, &s;urely, will not lie in the &s;trict
regard paid by the former to national privileges, and the
neglect of them by the latter. On the contrary, the
prince of &s;mall abilities, as he felt his want of power,
&s;eems to have been always more moderate in this re&s;pect
than the other. Every parliament, a&s;&s;embled during the
reign of Edward, remon&s;trate again&s;t the exertion of
&s;ome arbitrary prerogative or other: We hear not any
complaints of that kind during the reign of Richard, till
the a&s;&s;embling of his la&s;t parliament, which was &s;um|moned
by his inveterate enemies, which dethroned him,
which framed their complaints during the time of the
mo&s;t furious convul&s;ions, and who&s;e te&s;timony can there|fore
have, on that account, much le&s;s authority with
every equitable judge<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Compare, in this view, the abridgment of the records, by Sir Robert Cotton, during the&s;e two reigns.</NOTE>. Both the&s;e princes experienced
the encroachments of the Great upon their authority.
Edward, reduced to nece&s;&s;ities, was obliged to make
<PB N="55" REF="63">
an expre&s;s bargain with his parliament, and to &s;ell &s;ome
of his prerogatives for pre&s;ent &s;upply; but as they were
acquainted with his genius and capacity, they ventured
not to demand any exorbitant conce&s;&s;ions, or &s;uch as
were incompatible with regal and &s;overeign power:
The weakne&s;s of Richard tempted the parliament to
extort a commi&s;&s;ion, which in a manner dethroned the
prince, and transferred the &s;ceptre into the hands of the
nobility. The events were al&s;o &s;uitable to the character
of each. Edward had no &s;ooner got the &s;upply, than
he departed from the engagements, which had induced
the parliament to grant it; he openly told his people,
that he had but <HI>di&s;&s;embled</HI> with them when he &s;eemed to
make them the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions; and he re&s;umed and re|tained
all his prerogatives. But Richard, becau&s;e he
was detected in con&s;ulting and deliberating with the
judges on the lawfulne&s;s of re&s;toring the con&s;titution,
found his barons immediately in arms again&s;t him; was
deprived of his liberty; &s;aw his favourites, his mini&s;ters,
his tutor, butchered before his face, or bani&s;hed and at|tainted;
and was obliged to give way to all this violence.
There cannot be a more remarkable oppo&s;ition between
the fortunes of two princes: It were happy for &s;ociety,
that this oppo&s;ition depended always on the ju&s;tice or
inju&s;tice of the mea&s;ures which men embrace; and not
rather on the different degrees of prudence and vigour,
with which the&s;e mea&s;ures are &s;upported.</P>
<P>THERE was a &s;en&s;ible decay of the authority of the
eccle&s;ia&s;tics during this period.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mi&s;cellan$|ous tran&s;|actions during this reign.</NOTE> The di&s;gu&s;t, which the
laity had received from the numerous u&s;urpations both
of the court of Rome, and of their own clergy, had
weaned the kingdom very much from &s;uper&s;tition; and
&s;trong &s;ymptoms appeared, from time to time, of a ge|neral
de&s;ire to &s;hake off the bondage of the Romi&s;h
church. In the committee of eighteen, to whom
<PB N="56" REF="64">
Richard's la&s;t parliament delegated their whole power,
there is not the name of one eccle&s;ia&s;tic to be found;
a neglect which is almo&s;t without example, while the
catholic religion &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in England<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The following pa&s;&s;age in Cotton's abridgment, p. 196, &s;hows a &s;trange prejudice again&s;t the church and churchmen. <HI>The commons after|wards coming into the parliament, and making their prote&s;tation, &s;hewed, that for want of good redre&s;s about the King's per&s;on in his hou&s;hold, in all his courts, touching maintainers in every county, and purveyors, the commons were daily pilled, and nothing defended again&s;t the enemy, and that it &s;hould &s;hortly deprive the King and undo the &s;tate. Wherefore in the &s;ame government, they entirely require redre&s;s. Whereupon the King appointed &s;undry bi&s;hops, lords and nobles, to &s;it in privy council about the&s;e matters: Who &s;ince that they mu&s;t begin at the head and go at the reque&s;t of the commons, they in the pre&s;ence of the King charged his confe&s;&s;or not to come into the court but upon the four principal fe&s;tivals.</HI> We &s;hould little expect that a Popi&s;h privy council, in order to pre&s;erve the King's morals, &s;hould order his confe&s;&s;or to be kept at a di&s;tance from him. This incident happened in the minority of Richard. As the popes had for a long time re&s;ided at Avignon, and the majority of the &s;acred college were Frenchmen, this circum&s;tance naturally en|crea&s;ed the aver&s;ion of the nation to the papal power: But the preju|dice again&s;t the Engli&s;h clergy cannot be accounted for from that cau&s;e.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE aver&s;ion entertained again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed church
&s;oon found principles and tenets, and rea&s;onings, by
which it could ju&s;tify and &s;upport it&s;elf. John Wick|liffe,
a &s;ecular prie&s;t, educated at Oxford, began, in the
latter end of Edward III. to &s;pread the doctrines of re|formation
by his di&s;cour&s;es, &s;ermons and writings; and
he made many di&s;ciples among men of all ranks and &s;ta|tions.
He &s;eems to have been a man of parts and learn|ing;
and has the honour of being the fir&s;t per&s;on in Eu|rope,
who publicly called in que&s;tion tho&s;e doctrines,
which had univer&s;ally pa&s;&s;ed for certain and undi&s;puted
during &s;o many ages. Wickliffe him&s;elf, as well as his
di&s;ciples, who received the name of Wickliffites or Lol|lards,
was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a remarkable au&s;terity of life
and manners; a circum&s;tance common to almo&s;t all tho&s;e
<PB N="57" REF="65">
who dogmatize in any new way, both becau&s;e men,
who draw to them the attention of the public, and ex|po&s;e
them&s;elves to the odium of great multitudes, are
obliged to be very guarded in their conduct, and becau&s;e
few, who have a &s;trong propen&s;ity to plea&s;ure or bu&s;ine&s;s,
will enter upon &s;o difficult and laborious an undertaking.
The doctrines of Wickliffe, being derived from his
&s;earch into the &s;criptures and into eccle&s;ia&s;tical antiquity,
were nearly the &s;ame with tho&s;e propagated by the re|formers
in the &s;ixteenth century: He only carried &s;ome
of them farther than was done by the more &s;ober part
of the&s;e reformers. He denied the doctrine of the real
pre&s;ence, the &s;upremacy of the church of Rome, the
merit of mona&s;tic vows: He maintained, that the &s;crip|ture
was the &s;ole rule of faith; that the church was de|pendant
on the &s;tate, and ought to be reformed by it;
that the clergy ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s no e&s;tates; that the beg|ging
friars were a general nui&s;ance, and ought not to
be &s;upported<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 191. 208. 283, 284. Spelman concil. vol. ii. p. 630. Knyghton, p. 2657.</NOTE>; that the numerous ceremonies of the
church were hurtful to true piety: He a&s;&s;erted, that oaths
were unlawful, that dominion was founded in grace,
that every thing was &s;ubject to fate and de&s;tiny, and
that all men were prede&s;tinated either to eternal &s;alva|tion
or reprobation<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Harpsfield, p. 668. 673, 674. Walden&s;. tom. i. lib. 3. art. I. cap. 8.</NOTE>. From the whole of his doctrines,
Wickliffe appears to have been &s;trongly tinctured with
enthu&s;ia&s;m, and to have been thereby the better qualified
to oppo&s;e a church, who&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hing character was
&s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>THE propagation of the&s;e principles gave great alarm
to the clergy; and a bull was i&s;&s;ued by Pope Gregory
XI. for taking Wickliffe into cu&s;tody, and examining
<PB N="58" REF="66">
into the &s;cope of his opinions<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Spelm. conc. vol. ii. p. 621. Wal&s;ingham, p. 201, 202, 203.</NOTE> Courteney, bi&s;hop of
London, cited him before his tribunal; but the reformer
had now got very powerful protectors, who &s;creened him
from the eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction. The duke of Lan|ca&s;ter,
who then governed the kingdom, encouraged the
principles of Wickliffe; and he made no &s;cruple, as well
as lord Piercy, the mare&s;chal, to appear openly in court
with him, in order to give him countenance upon his
trial: He even in&s;i&s;ted, that Wickli&s;&s;e &s;hould &s;it in the
bi&s;hop's pre&s;ence, while his principles were examined:
Courteney exclaimed again&s;t this in&s;ult: The mob of
London, thinking their prelate affronted, attacked the
duke and mare&s;chal, who e&s;caped from their hands with
&s;ome difficulty<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Harpsfield in Hi&s;t. Wickl. p. 683.</NOTE>. And the populace, &s;oon after, broke
into the hou&s;es of both the&s;e noblemen, threatned their
per&s;ons, and plundered their goods. The bi&s;hop of
London had the merit of appea&s;ing their fury and re&s;ent|ment.</P>
<P>THE duke of Lanca&s;ter, however, &s;till continued his
protection to Wickliffe, during the minority of Richard;
and the principles of that reformer had &s;o far propagated
them&s;elves, that when the Pope &s;ent to Oxford a new
bull again&s;t the&s;e doctrines, the univer&s;ity deliberated for
&s;ome time, whether they &s;hould receive the bull; and
they never took any vigorous mea&s;ures in con&s;equence of
the papal orders<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Wood's Ant. Oxon. lib. I. p. 191, &amp;c. Wal&s;ingham, p. 201.</NOTE>. Even the populace of London were
at length brought to entertain favourable &s;entiments of
this reformer: When he was cited before a &s;ynod at
Lambeth, the mob broke into the a&s;&s;embly, and &s;o
overawed the prelates, who found both the people and
the court again&s;t them, that they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him without
any farther cen&s;ures.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="67">
THE clergy, we may well believe, were more wanting
in power than inclination to puni&s;h this new here&s;y,
which &s;truck at all their credit, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and authority.
But there was hitherto no law in England, by which the
&s;ecular arm was empowered to &s;upport orthodoxy; and
the eccle&s;ia&s;tics endeavoured to &s;upply the defect by a very
extraordinary and very unwarrantable artifice. In the
year 1381, there was an act pa&s;&s;ed, enjoining &s;heriffs
to apprehend the preachers of here&s;y and their abettors;
but this &s;tatute had been &s;urreptitiou&s;ly obtained by the
clergy, and had the formality of an enrolment without
the con&s;ent of the commons. In the &s;ub&s;equent &s;e&s;&s;ion,
the lower hou&s;e complained of this fraud; affirmed,
that they had no intention to bind them&s;elves to the pre|lates
farther than their ance&s;tors had done before them;
and required that the pretended &s;tatute &s;hould be re|pealed,
which was done accordingly<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Cotton's abridgment, p. 285.</NOTE>. But it is remark|able,
that, notwith&s;tanding this vigilance of the com|mons,
the clergy had &s;o much art and influence, that the
repeal was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the act, which never had
any legal authority, remains to this day upon the &s;tatute
book<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">5 Rich. II. chap. 5.</NOTE>: Tho' the clergy &s;till thought proper to keep it
in re&s;erve, and not proceed to the immediate execution
of it.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides the defect of power in the church, which
&s;aved Wickliffe, that reformer him&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding
his enthu&s;ia&s;m, &s;eems not to have been actuated by the
&s;pirit of martyrdom; and in all &s;ub&s;equent trials before
the prelates, he &s;o explained away his doctrine by tor|tured
meanings, as to render it quite innocent and inof|fen&s;ive<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 206. Knyghton, p. 2655, 2656.</NOTE> Mo&s;t of his followers imitated his cautious
di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;aved them&s;elves either by recantations or
explanations. He died of a pal&s;y in the year 1385 at his
<PB N="60" REF="68">
rectory of Lutterworth in the county of Leice&s;ter; and
the clergy, mortified that he &s;hould have e&s;caped their
vengeance, took care, be&s;ides a&s;&s;uring people of his eternal
damnation, to repre&s;ent his la&s;t di&s;temper as a vi&s;ible
judgment of heaven upon him for his multiplied here&s;ies
and impieties<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 312. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 537.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE pro&s;elytes, however, of Wickliffe's opinions
&s;till encrea&s;ed in England<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 2663.</NOTE>: Some monki&s;h writers re|pre&s;ent
the half of the kingdom as infected by tho&s;e prin|ciples:
They were carried over to Bohemia by &s;ome
youth of that nation, who &s;tudied in Oxford: But tho'
the age &s;eemed &s;trongly di&s;po&s;ed to receive them, affairs
were not yet fully ripe for this great revolution; and the
fini&s;hing blow to eccle&s;ia&s;tical power was re&s;erved to a
period of more curio&s;ity, literature, and inclination for
novelties.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the Engli&s;h parliament continued to
check the clergy and the court of Rome by more &s;ober
and more legal expedients. They enacted anew the &s;ta|tute
of <HI>provi&s;ors,</HI> and affixed higher penalties to the
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of it, which, in &s;ome in&s;tances, was even
made capital<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">13 Rich. II. cap. 3. 16 Rich. II. cap. 4.</NOTE>. The court of Rome had fallen upon a
new device, which encrea&s;ed their authority over the
prelates: The Pope, who found that the expedient of
arbitrarily depriving them was violent, and liable to op|po&s;ition,
attained the &s;ame end by transferring &s;uch of
them, as were obnoxious, to poorer &s;ees, and even to
nominal &s;ees, <HI>in partibus infidelium.</HI> It was thus that the
archbi&s;hop of York, and the bi&s;hops of Durham and
Chiche&s;ter, the King's mini&s;ters, had been treated after
the prevalence of Gloce&s;ter's faction: The good bi&s;hop
of Carli&s;le met with the &s;ame fate after the acce&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="61" REF="69">
Henry IV. For the Pope always joined with the pre|vailing
powers, when they did not thwart his preten&s;ions.
The parliament, in the reign of Richard, enacted a law
again&s;t this abu&s;e: And the King made a general re|mon&s;trance
to the court of Rome again&s;t all tho&s;e impo&s;i|tions,
which he calls <HI>horrible exce&s;&s;es</HI> of that court<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. vii. p. 672.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was u&s;ual at this time for the church, that they
might elude the mortmain act, to make their votaries
leave lands in tru&s;t to certain per&s;ons, under who&s;e
name the clergy enjoyed the benefit of the beque&s;t:
The parliament al&s;o &s;topped the progre&s;s of this abu&s;e<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Knyghton, p. 27. 38. Cotton, p. 355.</NOTE>.
In the 17th of the King, the commons prayed, <HI>that re|medy
might be had again&s;t &s;uch religious per&s;ons as cau&s;e their
villains to marry free women inheritable, whereby the e&s;tate
comes to tho&s;e religious hands by collu&s;ion</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 355.</NOTE>. This was a new
device of the clergy.</P>
<P>THE papacy was at this time &s;omewhat weakened by
a &s;chi&s;m, which la&s;ted for forty years, and gave great
&s;candal to the devoted partizans of the holy &s;ee. After
the Popes had re&s;ided many years at Avignon, Gregory
XI. was per&s;uaded to return to Rome; and upon his
death, which happened in 1380, the Romans, re&s;olute
to fix, for the future, the &s;eat of the papacy in Italy,
be&s;ieged the cardinals in the conclave, and con&s;trained
them, tho' they were mo&s;tly Frenchmen, to elect Urban
VI. an Italian, into that high dignity. The French
cardinals, &s;o &s;oon as they recovered their liberty, fled
from Rome, and prote&s;ting again&s;t the forced election,
cho&s;e Robert, &s;on of the count of Geneva, who took
the name of Clement VII. and re&s;ided at Avignon. All
the kingdoms of Chri&s;tendom, according to their &s;e|veral
intere&s;ts and inclinations, were divided between
<PB N="62" REF="70">
the&s;e two pontiffs. The court of France adhered to
Clement, and were followed by their allies, the King
of Ca&s;tile, and King of Scotland: England of cour&s;e
was thrown into the other party, and declared for Ur|ban.
Thus the appellation of <HI>Clementines</HI> and <HI>Urbani&s;ts</HI>
di&s;tracted Europe for &s;everal years; and each party damned
the other as &s;chi&s;matics, and as rebels to the true vicar
of Chri&s;t. But this circum&s;tance, tho' it weakened the
papal authority, had not &s;o great an effect as might na|turally
be imagined. Tho' any King could ea&s;ily, at
fir&s;t, make his kingdom embrace the party of one Pope
or the other, or even keep it &s;ome time in &s;u&s;pence be|tween
them, he could not &s;o ea&s;ily transfer his obedience
at plea&s;ure: The people attached them&s;elves to their
own party as to a religious opinion; and conceived an
extreme abhorrence to the oppo&s;ite party, whom they
regarded as little better than Saracens or infidels. Cru|&s;ades

<P>WE meet with this preamble to a law enacted at the
very beginning of this reign: &startq;Whereas divers per&s;ons
of &s;mall garri&s;on of land or other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions do make
great retinue of people, as well of e&s;quires as of
<PB N="63" REF="71">
others, in many parts of the realm, giving to them
hats and other livery of one &s;uit by year, taking again
towards them the value of the &s;ame livery or perca&s;e
the double value, by &s;uch covenant and a&s;&s;urance, that
every of them &s;hall maintain other in all quarrels, be
they rea&s;onable or unrea&s;onable, to the great mi&s;|chief
and oppre&s;&s;ion of the people, &amp;c<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">I Rich. II. chap. 7.</NOTE>&endq;. This
preamble contains a true picture of the &s;tate of the king|dom.
The laws had been &s;o feebly executed, even during
the long, active, and vigilant reign of Edward III. that
no &s;ubject could tru&s;t to their protection. Men openly
a&s;&s;ociated them&s;elves, under the patronage of &s;ome great
man, for their mutual defence. They had public badges
by which their confederacy was di&s;tingui&s;hed. They
&s;upported each other in all quarrels, iniquities, extor|tions,
murders, robberies, and other crimes. Their
chieftain was more their &s;overeign than the King him&s;elf;
and their own band was more connected with them than
their country. Hence the perpetual turbulence, di&s;or|ders,
factions, and civil wars of tho&s;e times: Hence the
&s;mall regard paid to a character or the opinion of the
public: Hence the large di&s;cretionary prerogatives of the
crown, and the danger which might have en&s;ued from
the too great limitation of them. If the King had po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
no arbitrary powers, while all the nobles a&s;&s;umed
and exerci&s;ed them, there mu&s;t have en&s;ued an ab&s;olute
anarchy in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>ONE great mi&s;chief, attending the&s;e confederacies,
was the extorting from the King pardons for the mo&s;t
enormous crimes. The parliament often endeavoured,
in the la&s;t reign, to deprive the prince of this preroga|tive;
but in the pre&s;ent, they were contented with an
<PB N="64" REF="72">
abridgement of it. They enacted, that no pardon for
rapes or murder from malice prepen&s;e &s;hould be valid,
unle&s;s the crime was particularly &s;pecified in it<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">13 Rich. II. chap. I.</NOTE>. There
were al&s;o &s;ome other circum&s;tances required for the
pa&s;&s;ing any pardons of this kind: An excellent law;
but ill ob&s;erved, like mo&s;t laws, which thwart the man|ners
of the people, and the prevailing cu&s;toms of the
times.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, from the&s;e voluntary a&s;&s;ociations
among the people, that the whole force of the &s;eudal
&s;y&s;tem was in a manner di&s;&s;olved, and that the Engli&s;h
had nearly returned in that particular to the &s;ame &s;itua|tion
in which they &s;tood before the Norman conque&s;t.
It was indeed impo&s;&s;ible, that that &s;y&s;tem could long &s;ub|&s;i&s;t,
under the con&s;tant revolutions, to which landed pro|perty
is every where &s;ubject. When the great feudal
baronies were fir&s;t erected, the lord lived in opulence in
the mid&s;t of his va&s;&s;als: He was in a &s;ituation to pro|tect
and cheri&s;h and defend them: The quality of pa|tron
naturally united it&s;elf to that of &s;uperior: And
the&s;e two principles of authority mutually &s;upported each
other. But when, by the various divi&s;ions and mixtures
of property, a man's &s;uperior came to live at a di&s;tance
from him, and could no longer give him &s;helter or coun|tenance;
the tie gradually became more fictitious than
real: New connexions from neighbourhood or other
cau&s;es were formed: Protection was &s;ought by voluntary
&s;ervices and attachment: The appearance of valour, &s;pi|rit,
ability in any great man extended his intere&s;t very
far: And if the &s;overeign was deficient in the&s;e qualities,
he was equally, if not more expo&s;ed to the u&s;urpations
of the ari&s;tocracy than even during the vigour of the
feudal &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="73">
THE greate&s;t novelty introduced into the civil go|vernment
during this reign was the creation of peers
by patent. The lord Beauchamp of Holt was the fir&s;t
peer, who was advanced to the hou&s;e of lords in this
manner. The practice of levying benevolences is al&s;o
mentioned in this reign.</P>

<P>THE Engli&s;h had &s;o long been familiarized to the
hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of their monarchy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Title of the King.</NOTE> the in|&s;tances
of departure from it had always born &s;uch
&s;trong &s;ymptoms of inju&s;tice and violence, and &s;o little
of a national choice or election, and the returns to the
true line had ever been deemed &s;uch fortunate incidents
in their hi&s;tory, that Henry was afraid, left, in re&s;ting
his title on the con&s;ent of the people, he &s;hould build on
a foundation, to which the people them&s;elves were not
accu&s;tomed, and who&s;e &s;olidity they would with difficulty
be brought to recognize. The idea too of choice &s;eemed
always to imply that of conditions, and a liberty of re|calling
the con&s;ent upon any &s;uppo&s;ed violation of them;
an idea which was not naturally agreeable to a &s;overeign,
and might be dangerous to the people them&s;elves, who,
lying &s;o much under the influence of turbulent nobles,
had ever paid but a very imperfect obedience even to
their hereditary princes. For the&s;e rea&s;ons Henry was
determined never to have recour&s;e to this claim; the
only one, on which his authority could con&s;i&s;tently &s;tand:
He cho&s;e rather to patch up his title in the be&s;t manner
he could from other preten&s;ions: And in the end, he left
<PB N="67" REF="75">
him&s;elf, in the eyes of men of &s;en&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XVIII.</NOTE> no foundation of
right, but his pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; a very precarious claim,
which, by its very nature, was liable to be overthrown
by every faction of the great, or prejudice of the people.
He had indeed a pre&s;ent advantage over his competitor:
The heir of the hou&s;e of Mortimer, who had been de|clared
in parliament the true heir of the crown, was a
boy of &s;even years of age<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, vol. i. p. 151.</NOTE>: His friends con&s;ulted his
&s;afety by keeping &s;ilence with regard to his title: Henry
detained him and his younger brother in an honourable
cu&s;tody at Wind&s;or ca&s;tle: But he had rea&s;on to dread,
that, in proportion as that nobleman grew to man's
e&s;tate, he would draw to him the attachment of the peo|ple,
and make them reflect on the fraud, violence, and
inju&s;tice, by which he had been excluded from the
throne. Many favourable topics would occur in his be|half:
He was born in the country; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an exten&s;ive
intere&s;t from the greatne&s;s and alliances of his family;
however criminal the depo&s;ed monarch might be, this
youth was entirely innocent; he was of the &s;ame religion,
and educated in the &s;ame manners with the people, and
could not be governed by any &s;eparate intere&s;t: The&s;e
views would all concur to favour his claim; and tho' the
abilities of the pre&s;ent prince might ward off any dan|gerous
revolution, it was ju&s;tly to be apprehended, that
his authority could with difficulty be brought to equal
that of his predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>HENRY in his very fir&s;t parliament had rea&s;on to &s;ee
the danger attending that &s;tation, which he had a&s;&s;umed,
and the ob&s;tacles, which he would meet with, in go|verning
an unruly ari&s;tocracy, always divided by faction,
and &s;till more inflamed with the re&s;entments, con&s;equent
on &s;uch recent convul&s;ions. The peers on their a&s;|&s;embling
<PB N="68" REF="76">
broke out into violent animo&s;ities; forty gaunt|lets,
the gages of furious battle, were thrown on the
floor of the hou&s;e of lords by noblemen who gave mutual
challenges to each other; and <HI>liar</HI> and <HI>traitor</HI> re&s;ounded
from all quarters. The King had &s;o much authority
with the&s;e doughty champions, as to prevent all the com|bats,
which they threatened; but he was not able to
bring them to a proper compo&s;ure, or to an amicable
di&s;po&s;ition towards each other.</P>
<P>IT was not long before the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions broke out in
action.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1400.</NOTE> The earls of Rutland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An in&s;ur|rection.</NOTE> Kent, and Huntington
and lord Spencer, who were now degraded from the titles
of Albemarle, Surry, Exeter, and Gloce&s;ter, conferred
on them by Richard, entered into a con&s;piracy, together
with the earl of Sali&s;bury and lord Lumley, for rai&s;ing
an in&s;urrection, and for &s;eizing the King's per&s;on at
Wind&s;or<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 362. Otterbourne, p. 224.</NOTE>; but the treachery of Rutland gave him
warning of the danger. He &s;uddenly withdrew to Lon|don;
and the con&s;pirators, who came to Wind&s;or with
a body of 500 hor&s;e, found that they had mi&s;&s;ed this blow,
on which all the &s;ucce&s;s of their enterprize depended.
Henry appeared, next day, at King&s;ton upon Thames,
at the head of 20,000 men, mo&s;tly drawn from the city;
and his enemies, unable to re&s;i&s;t his power, di&s;per&s;ed
them&s;elves, with a view of rai&s;ing their followers in the
&s;everal counties, which were the &s;eat of their intere&s;t.
But the adherents of the King were hot in the pur&s;uit,
and every where oppo&s;ed them&s;elves to their progre&s;s.
The earls of Kent and Sali&s;bury were &s;eized at Ciren|ce&s;ter
by the citizens; and were next day beheaded with|out
farther ceremony, according to the cu&s;tom of the
times<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 363. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 556.</NOTE>. The citizens of Bri&s;tol treated Spencer and
<PB N="69" REF="77">
Lumley in the &s;ame manner. The earl of Huntington,
Sir Thomas Blount, Sir Benedict Sely, who were al&s;o
taken pri&s;oners, &s;uffered death, with many others of the
con&s;pirators, by orders from Henry. And when the
quarters of the&s;e unhappy men were brought to London,
no le&s;s than eighteen bi&s;hops and thirty-four mitred
abbots, joined the populace, and met them with the
mo&s;t indecent marks of joy and exultation.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;pectacle the mo&s;t &s;hocking to every one,
who retained any &s;entiment either of honour or humanity,
&s;till remained. The earl of Rutland appeared, carrying
on a pole the head of lord Spencer, his brother-in-law,
which he pre&s;ented in triumph to Henry, as a te&s;timony
of his loyalty. This infamous man, who was &s;oon after
duke of York by the death of his father, and fir&s;t prince
of the blood, had been in&s;trumental in the murder of his
uncle, the duke of Gloce&s;ter<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, vol. ii. p. 171.</NOTE>; had then de&s;erted
Richard, by whom he was tru&s;ted; had con&s;pired again&s;t
the life of Henry, to whom he had &s;worn allegiance; had
betrayed his a&s;&s;ociates, whom he had &s;educed into this
enterprize; and now di&s;played, in the face of the world,
the&s;e badges of his multiplied di&s;honour.</P>
<P>HENRY was &s;en&s;ible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1401.</NOTE> that, tho' the execution of the&s;e
con&s;pirators might &s;eem to give &s;ecurity to his throne,
the animo&s;ities, which remain after &s;uch bloody &s;cenes,
are always dangerous to royal authority; and he there|fore
determined not to encrea&s;e, by any hazardous enter|prize,
tho&s;e numerous enemies, with whom he was every
where &s;urrounded. While he was only a &s;ubject, he was
believed to have &s;trongly imbibed all the principles of his
father, the duke of Lanca&s;ter, and to have adopted the
prejudices which the Lollards in&s;pired again&s;t the abu&s;es
of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church: But finding him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="70" REF="78">
of the throne by &s;o precarious a title, he thought &s;uper|&s;tition
a very nece&s;&s;ary implement of public authority;
and he re&s;olved, by every expedient, to pay court to the
clergy. There were hitherto no penal laws enacted
again&s;t here&s;y; an indulgence which had nowi&s;e pro|ceeded
from a &s;pirit of toleration in the Romi&s;h church,
but from the ignorance and &s;implicity of the people, which had
rendered them unfit either for &s;tarting or re|ceiving
any new or curious doctrines, and which needed
not to be re&s;trained by any rigorous puni&s;hments. But
when the learning and genius of Wickliffe had once
broke the fetters of prejudice, the eccle&s;ia&s;tics called
aloud for the puni&s;hment of his di&s;ciples; and the King,
who was very little &s;crupulous in his conduct, was ea&s;ily
induced to &s;acrifice his principles to his intere&s;t, and to
acquire the favour of the church by that mo&s;t effectual
method, the gratifying their vengeance again&s;t all oppo|nents.
He engaged the parliament to pa&s;s a law for
this purpo&s;e, and it was enacted, that when any heretic,
who relap&s;ed or refu&s;ed co abjure his opinions, was deli|vered
over to the &s;ecular arm by the bi&s;hop or his com|mi&s;&s;aries,
he &s;hould be committed to the flames by the
civil magi&s;trate before the whole people<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">2 Henry IV. chap. vii.</NOTE>. This wea|pon
did not remain long unemployed in the hands of the
clergy: William Sautre, rector of St. O&s;ithes in London,
had been condemned by the convocation of Canterbury;
his &s;entence was ratified by the hou&s;e of peers; the King
i&s;&s;ued his writ for the execution<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii. p. 178.</NOTE>; and the unhappy
man attoned for his erroneous opinions by the penalty
of fire. This is the fir&s;t in&s;tance of that kind in Eng|land;
and thus one horror more was added to tho&s;e di&s;|mal
&s;cenes, which at that time were already but too
familiar to the people.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="79">
BUT the utmo&s;t precaution and prudence of Henry
could not &s;hield him from tho&s;e numerous inquietudes,
which a&s;&s;ailed him from every quarter. The connexions
of Richard with the royal family of France, made that
court exert its activity to recover his authority, or revenge
his death<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii. p. 123.</NOTE>; but tho' the confu&s;ions of England, tempted
the French to undertake &s;ome enterprize, by which they
might di&s;tre&s;s their ancient enemy, the greater confu&s;ions,
which they experienced at home, obliged them quickly
to accommodate matters; and Charles, content with re|covering
his daughter from Henry's hands, laid a&s;ide his
preparations, and renewed the truce between the two
kingdoms<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. viii, p. 142, 152. 219.</NOTE>. The attack of Guienne was al&s;o an inviting
attempt, which the pre&s;ent factions, that prevailed among
the French, obliged them to neglect. The Ga&s;cons,
affectionate to the memory of Richard, who had been
born among them, refu&s;ed to &s;wear allegiance to a prince
that had u&s;urped his throne, and murdered his per&s;on;
and the appearance of a French army on their frontiers,
would probably have tempted them to change ma&s;ters<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. viii. p. 110, 111.</NOTE>.
But the earl of Worce&s;ter, arriving with &s;ome Engli&s;h
troops, gave countenance to the partizans of England,
and overawed their opponents. Religion too was here
found a cement of their union with that kingdom.
The Ga&s;cons had been engaged by Richard's authority to ac|knowledge
the Pope of Rome; and they were &s;en|&s;ible,
that if they &s;ubmitted to France, it would be
nece&s;&s;ary for them to pay obedience to the Pope of
Avignon, whom they had been taught to dete&s;t as a
&s;chi&s;matic. Their principles on this head were too fa&s;t
rooted to admit of any &s;udden or violent alteration.</P>
<P>THE revolution in England proved likewi&s;e the occa|&s;ion
of an in&s;urrection in Wales.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrection in Wales.</NOTE> Owen Glendour, or
<PB N="72" REF="80">
Glendourduy, de&s;cended from the ancient princes of
that country, had become obnoxious on account of his
attachments to Richard; and Reginald, lord Gray of
Ruthyn, who was clo&s;ely connected with the new King,

which Glendour long &s;u&s;tained by his valour and acti|vity,
aided by the natural &s;trength of that country, and
the untamed &s;pirit of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>As Glendour committed deva&s;tations promi&s;cuou&s;ly on
all the Engli&s;h, he infe&s;ted the e&s;tate of the earl of
Marche; and Sir Edmund Mortimer, uncle to that
nobleman, led out the retainers of the family, and gave
battle to the Wel&s;h chieftain. His troops were routed,
and he him&s;elf was taken pri&s;oner<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, vol, i. p. 150.</NOTE>: At the &s;ame time,
the earl him&s;elf, who had been allowed to retire to his
ca&s;tle of Wigmore, and who, tho' a mere boy, took the
field with his followers, fell al&s;o into Glendour's hands,
and was carried by him into Wales<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. i. p. 151.</NOTE>. As Henry hated
mortally all the family of Marche, he allowed the earl
to remain in captivity; and tho' that young nobleman
was nearly allied to the Piercies, to who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he
him&s;elf had owed his crown, he refu&s;ed to the earl of
Northumberland permi&s;&s;ion to treat of his ran&s;om with
Glendour.</P>
<P>THE uncertainty in which Henry's affairs &s;tood for
a long time with France, as well as the confu&s;ion, in|cident
<PB N="73" REF="81">
to all great changes in government, tempted the
Scots to make incursions into England; and Henry, de|&s;irous
of taking revenge upon them, but afraid of ren|dering
his new government unpopular by requiring great
&s;upplies from his &s;ubjects, &s;ummoned at We&s;tmin&s;ter a
council of the peers, without the commons, and laid
before them the &s;tate of his affairs<NOTE N="j" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii. p. 125, 126.</NOTE>. The military part
of the feudal con&s;titution was now entirely gone: There
remained only &s;o much of that fabric as affected the civil

but voluntarily, to attend the King in an expe|dition
again&s;t Scotland, each of them at the head of a
certain number of his retainers<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. viii. p. 125.</NOTE>.
Henry conducted this
army to Edinburgh, of which he ea&s;ily took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion;
and he there &s;ummoned Robert III. to do homage to
him for his crown<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. viii. p. 155, 156, &amp;c.</NOTE>. But finding, that the Scots would
neither &s;ubmit nor give him battle, he returned in three
weeks, after making this u&s;ele&s;s bravade; and he di&s;|per&s;ed
his army.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ub&s;equent &s;ea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1402.</NOTE> Archibald earl of Douglas,
at the head of 12,000 men, and attended by many of
the principal nobility of Scotland, made an irruption into
England, and committed deva&s;tations on the northern
counties. On his return home, he was overtaken by the
Piercies, at Homeldon on the borders of England,
and a fierce battle en&s;ued, where the Scots were totally
routed. Douglas him&s;elf was taken pri&s;oner; as was
Mordac earl of Fife, &s;on of the duke of Albany, and ne|phew
of the Scots King, with the earls of Angus,
Murray, and Orkney, and many others of the Scots
gentry and nobility<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 366. Vita Ric. &s;ec. p. 180. Chron. Otterbourne, p. 237.</NOTE>. When Henry received intel|ligence
<PB N="74" REF="82">
of this victory, he &s;ent the earl of Northum|berland
orders not to ran&s;om his pri&s;oners, which that
nobleman regarded as his right, by the laws of war,
that prevailed in that age. The King intended to de|tain
them, that he might be able by their means to make
an advantageous peace with Scotland; but by this policy
he gave a new cau&s;e of di&s;gu&s;t to the family of Piercy.</P>
<P>THE obligations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1403.</NOTE> which Henry had owed to the earl
of Northumberland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The earl of Northum|berland re|bels.</NOTE> were of a kind the mo&s;t likely to
produce ingratitude on the one &s;ide, and di&s;content on
the other. The prince naturally became jealous of that
power, which had advanced him to the throne; and the
&s;ubject was not ea&s;ily &s;atisfied in the returns, which he
thought &s;o great a favour had merited. Tho' Henry, on
his acce&s;&s;ion, had be&s;towed the office of con&s;table on
Northumberland for life<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii. p. 89.</NOTE>, and conferred other gifts on
that family, the&s;e favours were regarded as their due;
the refu&s;al of any other reque&s;t was deemed an injury.
The impatient &s;pirit of Harry Piercy, and the factious
di&s;po&s;ition of the earl of Worce&s;ter, younger brother of
Northumberland, inflamed the di&s;contents of that noble|man;
and the precarious title of Henry tempted him to
&s;eek revenge, by overturning that throne, which he had
at fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed. He entered into a corre&s;pondence
with Glendour: He gave liberty to the earl of Dou|glas,
and made an alliance with that martial chieftain:
He rouzed up all his partizans to arms; and &s;uch unli|mited
authority at that time belonged to the great fami|lies,
that the &s;ame men, whom, a few years before, he
had conducted again&s;t Richard, now followed his &s;tan|dard
in oppo&s;ition to Henry. When the war was ready
to break out, Northumberland was &s;eized with a &s;udden
illne&s;s at Berwic; and young Piercy taking the command
<PB N="75" REF="83">
of the troops, marched towards Shrew&s;bury, in order to
join his forces with tho&s;e of Glendour. The King had
happily a &s;mall army on foot, with which he had in|tended
to act again&s;t the Scots; and knowing the im|portance
of celerity in all civil wars, he in&s;tantly hur|ried
down, that he might give battle to the rebels. He
approached Piercy near Shrew&s;bury, before that noble|man
was joined by Glendour; and the policy of the one
leader, and impatience of the other, made them both
ha&s;ten to a general engagement.</P>
<P>THE evening before the battle, Piercy &s;ent a mani|fe&s;to
to Henry, in which he renounced his allegiance,
&s;et that prince at defiance, and in the name of his father
and uncle, as well as his own, enumerated all the griev|ances
of which the nation had rea&s;on to complain. He
repre&s;ented the perjury, of which Henry had been guilty,
when, on landing at Raven&s;pur, he had &s;worn upon the
go&s;pels, before the earl of Northumberland, that he
had no other intention but to recover po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
dutchy of Lanca&s;ter, and that he would ever remain a
faithful &s;ubject to King Richard. He aggravated his
guilt in fir&s;t dethroning and then murdering that prince,
and in u&s;urping on the title of the hou&s;e of Mortimer,
to whom, both by lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and by declarations of
parliament, the throne, when vacant by Richard's death,
did of right belong. He complained of the cruel policy,
in allowing the young earl of Marche, whom he ought
to regard as his &s;overeign, to remain a captive in the
hands of his enemies, and in even refu&s;ing to all his
friends permi&s;&s;ion to treat of his ran&s;om. He charged him
again with perjury in loading the nation with heavy taxes,
after having &s;worn that, without the utmo&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, he
would never levy any impo&s;itions upon them. And he
reproached him with the arts employed in procuring fa|vourable
elections into parliament; arts, which he him|&s;elf
<PB N="76" REF="84">
had before imputed to Richard, and which he had
made one chief rea&s;on of that prince's arraignment and de|po&s;ition<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 21, 22, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
This manife&s;to was very well calculated to in|flame
the quarrel between the parties: The bravery of the
two leaders, promi&s;ed an ob&s;tinate engagement: And the
equality of the armies, being each about 12,000 men, a
number which rendered them not unmanageable by the
commanders, gave rea&s;on to expect a great effu&s;ion of
blood on both &s;ides, and a very doubtful i&s;&s;ue to the
combat.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall &s;carcely find any battle in tho&s;e ages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21&s;t July. Battle of Shrew&s;bury.</NOTE> where
the &s;hock was more terrible and more con&s;tant. Henry
expo&s;ed his per&s;on in the thicke&s;t of the fight: His gal|lant
&s;on, who&s;e military feats became afterwards &s;o fa|mous,
and who here performed his apprentice&s;hip in arms,
&s;ignalized him&s;elf on his father's foot&s;teps, and even a
wound, which he received on the face with an arrow,
could not oblige him to quit the field<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">T. Livii, p. 3.</NOTE>. Piercy &s;upported
that renown, which he had acquired in &s;o many bloody
combats. And Douglas, his antient enemy and now his
friend, &s;till appeared his rival, amid&s;t the horror and con|fu&s;ion
of the day. This nobleman performed feats of va|lour,
which are almo&s;t incredible: He &s;eemed determined
that the King of England &s;hould fall that day by his arm:
He &s;ought him all over the field of battle: And as Henry,
either to elude the attacks of the enemy upon his per&s;on,
or to encourage his own men by the belief of his pre|&s;ence
every where, had accoutered &s;everal captains in the
royal garb, the &s;word of Douglas rendered this honour
fatal to many<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 366, 367. Hall, fol. 22,</NOTE>. But while the armies were contending
in this furious manner, the death of Piercy, by an un|certain
hand, decided the victory, and the royali&s;ts pre|vailed.
There are &s;aid to have fallen that day on both
<PB N="77" REF="85">
&s;ides near two thou&s;and three hundred gentlemen; but
the per&s;ons of greate&s;t di&s;tinction were on the King's;
the earl of Stafford, Sir Hugh Shirley, Sir Nicholas
Gau&s;el, Sir Hugh Mortimer, Sir John Ma&s;&s;ey, Sir John
Calverley. About &s;ix thou&s;and private men peri&s;hed, of
whom two thirds were of Piercy's army<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Chron. Otterbourne, p. 224. Ypod Neu&s;t p. 560.</NOTE>. The earls
of Worce&s;ter and Douglas were taken pri&s;oners; The
former was beheaded at Shrew&s;bury; the latter was treat|ed
with the courte&s;y, which was due to his rank and
merit.</P>
<P>THE earl of Northumberland, having recovered his
health, had levyed an army, and was on his march to
join his &s;on; but being oppo&s;ed by the earl of We&s;tmore|land,
and hearing of the event of the battle at Shrew&s;|bury,
he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his forces, and came with a &s;mall re|tinue
to the King at York<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Chron. Otterbourne, p. 225.</NOTE>. He pretended, that his
&s;ole intention in arming was to mediate between the two
parties: Henry thought proper to accept the apology,
and even granted him a pardon for his offence: All the
other rebels were treated with equal lenity; and except
the earl of Worce&s;ter and Sir Richard Vernon, who
were regarded as the chief authors of the in&s;urrection, no
per&s;on, engaged in this dangerous de&s;ign, seems to have
peri&s;hed by the hands of the executioner<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii, p. 353.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT Northumberland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1405.</NOTE> tho' he had been pardoned,
knew, that he never &s;hould be tru&s;ted, and that he was
too powerful to be cordially forgiven by a prince, who&s;e
&s;ituation gave him &s;uch rea&s;onable grounds of jealou&s;y.
It was the effect either of Henry's vigilance or good for|tune,
or of the narrow genius of his enemies, that no
proper concert was ever formed among them. They ro&s;e
in rebellion one after another; and thereby afforded him
<PB N="78" REF="86">
an opportunity of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;ingly tho&s;e in&s;urrections,
which, had they been united, might have proved fatal
to his authority. The earl of Nottingham, &s;on to the
duke of Norfolk, and the archbi&s;hop of York, brother to
the earl of Wilt&s;hire, whom Henry, then duke of Lan|ca&s;ter,
had beheaded at Bri&s;tol, tho' they had remained
quiet, while Piercy was in the field, &s;till harboured in
their brea&s;t a violent hatred again&s;t the enemy of their fa|milies;
and they determined, in conjunction with the
earl of Northumberland, to &s;eek revenge again&s;t him.
They betook them&s;elves to arms before that powerful
nobleman was prepared to join them; and publi&s;hing a
manife&s;to, in which they reproached Henry with his u&s;ur|pation
of the crown and the murder of the late King,
they required, that the right line &s;hould be re&s;tored, and
all public grievances be redre&s;&s;ed. The earl of We&s;t|moreland,
who&s;e power lay in the neighbourhood, ap|proached
them with an inferior force at Shipton near
York; and being afraid to hazard a battle, he attempted
to &s;ubdue them by a &s;tratagem, which nothing but the
greate&s;t folly and &s;implicity on their part could have ren|dered
&s;ucce&s;sful. He de&s;ired a conference with the arch|bi&s;hop
and earl between the two armies: He heard their
grievances with great patience; He begged them to pro|po&s;e
the remedies: He approved of every thing which
they &s;ugge&s;ted: He granted them all their demands: He
al&s;o engaged that Henry &s;hould give them entire &s;atisfac|tion:
And when he &s;aw them plea&s;ed with the facility of
his conce&s;&s;ions, he ob&s;erved to them, that, &s;ince amity
was now in effect re&s;tored between them, it were better
on both &s;ides to di&s;mi&s;s their forces, which otherwi&s;e
would prove an in&s;upportable burthen to the country.
The archbi&s;hop and the earl of Nottingham immediately
i&s;&s;ued orders to that purpo&s;e: Their troops di&s;banded
upon the field: But We&s;tmoreland, who had &s;ecretly
<PB N="79" REF="87">
i&s;&s;ued contrary orders to <HI>his</HI> army, &s;eized the two rebels
without re&s;i&s;tance, and carried them to the King, who
was advancing with ha&s;ty marches to &s;uppre&s;s the rebel|lion<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 373. Otterbourne, p. 255.</NOTE>.
The trial and puni&s;hment of an archbi&s;hop
might have proved a very trouble&s;ome and dangerous un|dertaking,
had Henry proceeded regularly, and allowed
time for an opposition to form it&s;elf again&s;t that unu&s;ual
mea&s;ure. The celerity of the execution alone could here
render it &s;afe and prudent. Finding that Sir William
Ga&s;coigne, the chief ju&s;tice, made &s;ome &s;cruple of acting
on this occa&s;ion, he appointed Sir William Fulthorpe a
judge for that purpo&s;e; who, without any indictment,
trial or defence, pronounced &s;entence of death upon the
prelate, which was in&s;tantly executed. This was the
fir&s;t in&s;tance in England of a capital puni&s;hment inflicted
on a bi&s;hop; whence the clergy of that rank might learn,
that their crimes, as well as tho&s;e of laics, were not to
pa&s;s with impunity. The earl of Nottingham was con|demned
and executed in the &s;ame &s;ummary manner: But
tho' many other per&s;ons of condition, &s;uch as the lord
Falconberge, Sir Ralph Ha&s;tings, Sir John Colville,
were engaged in this rebellion, no more &s;eem to have
fallen victims to Henry's &s;everity.</P>
<P>THE earl of Northumberland, on receiving this intel|ligence,
fled into Scotland, together with lord Bardolf<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 374.</NOTE>;
and the King, without oppo&s;ition, reduced all the
ca&s;tles and fortre&s;&s;es, belonging to the&s;e noblemen. He
thence turned his arms again&s;t Glendour, over whom his
&s;on, the prince of Wales, had obtained &s;ome advantages:
But that enemy, more trouble&s;ome than dangerous, &s;till
found means of defending him&s;elf in his fa&s;tne&s;&s;es, and
of eluding, tho' not re&s;i&s;ting, all the force of England.
In a &s;ub&s;equent &s;ea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1407.</NOTE> the earl of Northumberland and
<PB N="80" REF="88">
lord Bardolf, impatient of their exile, entered the north,
in hopes of rai&s;ing the people to arms; but found the
country in &s;uch a po&s;ture as rendered all their attempts
un&s;ucce&s;sful. Sir Thomas Roke&s;by, &s;heriff of York|shire,
levied &s;ome forces, attacked the invaders at Bram|ham,
and gained a victory, in which both Northumber|land
and Bardolf were &s;lain<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 377. Chron. Otterb. p. 261.</NOTE>. This pro&s;perous event,
joined to the death of Glendour, which happened &s;oon
after, freed Henry from all his dome&s;tic enemies; and
this prince, who had mounted the throne by &s;uch unju&s;|tifiable
methods, and held it by &s;uch an exceptionable
title, had yet, by his valour, prudence, and addre&s;s, ac|cu&s;tomed
his people to the yoke, and had obtained a
greater a&s;cendant over his haughty barons, than the law
alone, not &s;upported by the&s;e active qualities, was ever
able to confer.</P>
<P>ABOUT the &s;ame time, fortune gave Henry an advan|tage
over that neighbour, who, by his &s;ituation, was be&s;t
enabled to di&s;turb his government. Robert the Third,
King of Scots, was a prince, tho' of &s;lender capacity,
extremely innocent and inoffen&s;ive in his conduct: But
Scotland, at that time, was &s;till le&s;s fitted than England
for cheri&s;hing, or even enduring, &s;overeigns of that cha|racter.
The duke of Albany, Robert's brother, a prince
of more abilities, at lea&s;t of a more boi&s;terous and violent
di&s;po&s;ition, had a&s;&s;umed the government of the &s;tate; and
not &s;atisfied with pre&s;ent authority, he entertained the
criminal purpo&s;e of extirpating his brother's children,
and of acquiring the crown to his own family. He threw
in pri&s;on David, his elde&s;t nephew; who there peri&s;hed
with hunger: James alone, the younger brother of Da|vid,
&s;tood between that tyrant and the throne; and King
Robert, &s;en&s;ible of his &s;on's danger, embarked him on
<PB N="81" REF="89">
board a &s;hip, with a view of &s;ending him into France,
and entru&s;ting him to the protection of that friendly
power. Unfortunately, the ve&s;&s;el was taken by the Eng|li&s;h;
prince James, a boy about nine years of age, was
carried to London; and tho' there &s;ub&s;i&s;ted a truce at
that time between the two kingdoms, Henry con&s;tantly
refu&s;ed to re&s;tore the young prince to his liberty. Robert,
worn out with cares and infirmities, was unable to bear
the &s;hock of this la&s;t misfortune; and he &s;oon after died,
leaving the government in the hands of the duke of Al|bany<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, lib. 10.</NOTE>. Henry was now more &s;en&s;ible than ever of the
importance of the acqui&s;ition, which he had made:
While he retained &s;uch a pledge in his hands, he was
&s;ure of keeping the duke of Albany in dependance; or
if offended, he could ea&s;ily, by re&s;toring the true heir,
take ample revenge upon the u&s;urper. But tho' the
King, by detaining James in the Engli&s;h court, had
&s;hown him&s;elf &s;omewhat deficient in genero&s;ity, he made
ample amends by giving that prince an excellent education,
which afterwards qualified him, when he mounted the
throne, to reform, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the rude and bar|barous
manners of his native country.</P>
<P>THE ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;itions, which always prevailed be|tween
France and England, were re&s;trained, during the
greate&s;t part of this reign, from appearing in action.
The jealou&s;ies and civil commotions, with which both
nations were di&s;turbed, kept each of them from taking
advantage of the unhappy &s;ituation of its neighbour. But
as the abilities and good fortune of Henry had been able
&s;ooner to compo&s;e the Engli&s;h factions, this prince be|gan,
in the latter part of his reign, to look abroad, and
to foment the animo&s;ities between the families of Bur|gundy
and Orleans, by which the government of France
<PB N="82" REF="90">
was, during that period, &s;o much di&s;tracted. He knew,
that one great &s;ource of the national di&s;content again&s;t
his predece&s;&s;or, was the inactivity of his reign; and he
hoped, by giving a new direction to the re&s;tle&s;s and un|quiet
&s;pirits of his people, to prevent their breaking out
in dome &s;tic wars and di&s;orders.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1411.</NOTE> That he might join
policy to force, he fir&s;t entered into treaty with the duke
of Burgundy, and &s;ent that prince a &s;mall body of troops,
which &s;upported him again&s;t his enemies<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 380.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1412.</NOTE> Soon after,
he hearkened to more advantageous propo&s;als made him
by the duke of Orleans, and di&s;patched a greater body
to &s;upport that party<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii. p. 715. 738.</NOTE>. But the leaders of the oppo&s;ite
factions having made a temporary accommodation of their
differences, the intere&s;ts of the Engli&s;h were &s;acrificed;
and this effort of Henry proved, in the i&s;&s;ue, entirely
vain and fruitle&s;s. The declining &s;tate of his health and
the &s;hortne&s;s of his reign, prevented him from renewing
the attempt, which his more fortunate &s;on carried to &s;o
great a length again&s;t the French monarchy.</P>
<P>SUCH were the military and foreign tran&s;actions of
this reign:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliamen|tary tran&s;|actions.</NOTE> The civil and parliamentary are &s;omewhat
more memorable; and more worthy of our attention.
During the two la&s;t reigns, the elections of the com|mons
had appeared a circum&s;tance of government not to
be neglected; and Richard was even accu&s;ed of u&s;ing
unwarrantable methods for procuring to his partizans a
&s;eat in that hou&s;e. This practice formed one con&s;ider|able
article of charge again&s;t him in his depo&s;ition; yet
Henry &s;crupled not to tread in his foot&s;teps, and to en|courage
the &s;ame abu&s;es in elections. Laws were en|acted
again&s;t &s;uch undue influence, and even a &s;heriff
was puni&s;hed for an iniquitous return, which he had
made<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 429.</NOTE>: But laws commonly were, at that time, very
<PB N="83" REF="91">
ill executed; and the liberties of the people, &s;uch as they
were, &s;tood on a &s;urer ba&s;is than on laws and parliamen|tary
elections. Tho' the hou&s;e of commons was little
able to with&s;tand the violent currents, which perpetually
ran between the monarchy and the ari&s;tocracy, and that
hou&s;e might ea&s;ily be brought, at a particular time, to
make the mo&s;t unwarrantable conce&s;&s;ions to either; the
general in&s;titutions of the &s;tate &s;till remained invariable;
the intere&s;ts of the &s;everal members continued on the
&s;ame footing; the &s;word was in the hands of the &s;ub|ject;
and the government, tho' thrown into temporary
di&s;orders, &s;oon &s;ettled it&s;elf on its antient foundations.</P>
<P>DURING the greate&s;t part of this reign, the King
was obliged to court popularity; and the hou&s;e of com|mons,
&s;en&s;ible of their own importance, began to a&s;&s;ume
powers, which had not u&s;ually been exerci&s;ed by their
predece&s;&s;ors. In the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of this reign, they pro|cured
a law, that no judge, in concurring with any ini|quitous
mea&s;ure, &s;hould be excu&s;ed by pleading the or|ders
of the King, or even the danger of his own life
from the menaces of the &s;overeign<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 364.</NOTE>. In the &s;econd year of Henry, they in&s;i&s;ted on maintaining the practice of not granting any &s;upply before they received an an|&s;wer
to their petitions; which was a tacit method of
bargaining with the prince<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 406.</NOTE>. In the fifth year, they
de&s;ired the King to remove from his hou&s;ehold four of|ficers
who had di&s;plea&s;ed them, among whom was his
own confe&s;&s;or; and Henry, though he told them, that
he knew of no offence, which the&s;e per&s;ons had com|mitted,
yet, in order to gratify them, complied with their
reque&s;t<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 426.</NOTE>. In the &s;ixth year, they voted the King &s;up|plies,
but appointed trea&s;urers of their own, to &s;ee the
money di&s;bur&s;ed for the purpo&s;es intended, and required
<PB N="84" REF="92">
them to deliver in their accounts to the hou&s;e<NOTE N="j" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 438.</NOTE>. In the
eighth year, they propo&s;ed thirty very important articles
for the regulation of the government and hou&s;ehold,
which were all granted them; and they even obliged all
the members of council, all the judges, and all the offi|cers
of the hou&s;ehold, to &s;wear to the ob&s;ervance of
them<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 456. 457.</NOTE>. The abridger of the records ob&s;erves the un|u&s;ual
liberties taken by the &s;peaker and the hou&s;e during
this period<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 462.</NOTE>. But the great authority of the commons
was but a temporary advantage ari&s;ing from the pre&s;ent
&s;ituation. In a &s;ub&s;equent parliament, when the &s;peaker
made his cu&s;tomary applications to the throne for liberty
of &s;peech, the King, having now overcome all his do|mestic
difficulties, plainly told him, that he would have
no novelties introduced, and would enjoy his prerogatives.
But on the whole, the limitations of the government
&s;eem to have been more &s;en&s;ibly felt, and more carefully
maintained by Henry than by any of his predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>DURING this reign, when the hou&s;e of commons were,
at any time, brought to make unwary conce&s;&s;ions to
the crown, they al&s;o &s;howed their freedom by a very
&s;peedy retractation of them. Henry, tho' he entertained a
perpetual and well-grounded jealou&s;y of the family of
Mortimer, allowed not their name to be once mentioned
in parliament; and as none of the rebels had ventured
to declare the earl of Marche king, he never attempt|ed
to procure, what would not have been refu&s;ed him,
an expre&s;s declaration again&s;t the claim of that noble|man;
becau&s;e he knew that &s;uch a declaration, in the
pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, would have no authority, and
would only &s;erve to revive the memory of Mortimer's
title in the minds of the people. He proceeded in his
purpo&s;e after a more artful and covert manner. He pro|cured
<PB N="85" REF="93">
a &s;ettlement of the crown on him&s;elf and his heirs|male<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 454.</NOTE>,
thereby tacitly excluding the females, and tran&s;|ferring
the Salic law to the Engli&s;h government. He
thought, that, tho' the hou&s;e of Plantagenet had at fir&s;t
derived their title from females, this was a remote event,
unknown to the generality of the people; and if he could
once accu&s;tom the nation to the practice of excluding
women, the title of the earl of Marche would gradually
be forgot and neglected by them. But he was very un|fortunate
in this attempt. During the long conte&s;ts with
France, the inju&s;tice of the Salic law had been &s;o much
exclaimed again&s;t by the nation, that a contrary prin|ciple
had taken deep root in the minds of men, and it
was now become impo&s;&s;ible to eradicate it. The &s;ame
hou&s;e of commons, therefore, in a &s;ub&s;equent &s;e&s;&s;ion,
apprehen&s;ive that they had overturned the foundations
of the Engli&s;h government, and that they had opened
the door to move civil wars than might en&s;ue even from
the irregular advancement of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter,
applied with &s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s for a new &s;ettlement of the
crown, that Henry yielded to their reque&s;t, and agreed
to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the prince&s;&s;es of his family<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii. p. 462.</NOTE>. A cer|tain
proof, that no-body was, in his heart, &s;atisfied with
the King's title to the crown, or knew on what principle to
re&s;t it.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the commons, during this reign, &s;howed a
very laudable zeal for liberty in their tran&s;actions with
the crown; their efforts again&s;t the church were &s;till
more extraordinary, and &s;eemed to anticipate very much
on the &s;pirit which became &s;o general in little more than
a century afterwards. I know, that the credit of the&s;e
pa&s;&s;ages re&s;ts entirely on one antient hi&s;torian<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham.</NOTE>; but

it was contrary to the intere&s;ts of his order to pre&s;erve
the memory of &s;uch tran&s;actions, much more to forge
precedents, which po&s;terity might, &s;ome time, be tempt|ed
to imitate. This is a truth &s;o evident, that the mo&s;t
likely way of accounting for the &s;ilence of the records on
this head, is by &s;uppo&s;ing, that the authority of &s;ome
churchmen was &s;o great as to procure a razure, with re|gard
to the&s;e circum&s;tances, which the indi&s;cretion of
one of that order has happily pre&s;erved to us.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ixth of Henry, the commons, who had been
required to grant &s;upplies, propo&s;ed in plain terms to the
King, that he &s;hould &s;eize all the temporalities of the
church, and employ them as a perpetual fund to &s;erve
the exigences of the &s;tate. They in&s;i&s;ted, that the
clergy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a third of the lands of the kingdom;
that they contributed nothing to the &s;upport of the
public burdens; and that their exorbitant riches tended
only to di&s;qualify them for performing their mini&s;terial
functions with proper zeal and attention. When this
addre&s;s was pre&s;ented, the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury,
who then attended the King, objected, that the clergy,
tho' they went not in per&s;on to the wars, &s;ent their va&s;|&s;als
and tenants in all ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity; while at the
&s;ame time, they them&s;elves, who &s;taid at home, were
employed, night and day, in offering up their prayers
for the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of the &s;tate. The &s;peaker
&s;miled, and replied without re&s;erve, that he thought the
prayers of the church but a very &s;lender &s;upply. The
archbi&s;hop, however, prevailed in the di&s;pute: The
King di&s;couraged the application of the commons: And
the lords rejected the bill which the lower hou&s;e had
framed for de&s;poiling the church of her revenues<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 371. Ypod Neu&s;t. p. 563.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="97">
THE commons were not di&s;couraged by this repul&s;e:
In the eleventh of the King they returned to the charge
with more zeal than before: They made a calculation
of all the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues, which, by their account,
amounted to 485,000 marks a year, and included 18,400
ploughs of land. They propo&s;ed to divide this riches
among fifteen new earls, 1500 knights, 6000 e&s;quires,
and a hundred ho&s;pitals; be&s;ides 20,000 pounds a year
which the King might take for his own u&s;e: And they
in&s;i&s;ted, that the clerical functions would be better per|formed
than at pre&s;ent, by 15,000 pari&s;h prie&s;ts, at the
rate of &s;even marks apiece of yearly &s;tipend<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 379. Tit. Livius.</NOTE>. This
application was accompanied with an addre&s;s for mitiga|ting
the &s;tatutes enacted again&s;t the Lollards, which
&s;hows from what &s;ource the addre&s;s came. The King
gave the commons a &s;evere reply, and farther to &s;atisfy
the church, and to prove that he was quite in earne&s;t,
he ordered a Lollard to be burned before the di&s;&s;olution of
the parliament<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. viii. p. 627. Otterbourne, p. 267.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WE have now related almo&s;t all the memorable tran&s;|actions
of this reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1413.</NOTE> which was bu&s;y and active; but
produced few events, that de&s;erve to be tran&s;mitted to
po&s;terity. The King was &s;o much employed in de|&s;ending
his crown, which he had obtained by &s;uch un|warrantable
means, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by &s;o bad a title, that
he had little lei&s;ure to look abroad, or perform any acti|ons,
which might redound to the honour or advantage of
the nation. His health declined vi&s;ibly &s;ome months be|fore
his death: He was &s;ubject to fits, which bereaved
him, for the time, of his &s;en&s;es: And tho' he was yet
in the flower of his age, his end was vi&s;ibly approaching.
<PB N="88" REF="98">
HE expired at We&s;tmin&s;ter in the forty-&s;ixth year of his
age, and the thirteenth of his reign.</P>
<P>THE great popularity, which Henry enjoyed before he
attained the crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th March Death and character of the King.</NOTE> and which had &s;o much aided him in
the acquisition of it, was entirely lo&s;t many years before
the end of his reign; and he governed his people more
by terror than by affection, more by his own policy than
by their &s;en&s;e of duty or allegiance. When men came
to reflect in cold blood on the crimes which had led him
to the throne; the rebellion again&s;t his prince; the depo|&s;ition
of a lawful King guilty &s;ometimes perhaps of oppre&s;|&s;ion,
but more frequently of imprudences; the exclu&s;ion of
the true heir; the murder of his &s;overeign and near re|lation;
the&s;e were &s;uch enormities as drew on him the
hatred of his &s;ubjects, &s;anctified all the rebellions again&s;t
him, and made the executions, tho' not remarkably &s;e|vere,
which he found nece&s;&s;ary for the maintenance of his
authority, appear cruel as well as iniquitous to the people.
Yet without pretending to apologize for the&s;e crimes,
which mu&s;t ever be held in dete&s;tation, it may be re|marked,
that he was in&s;en&s;ibly led into this blameable
conduct by a train of incidents, which few men po&s;&s;e&s;s
virtue enough to with&s;tand. The inju&s;tice with which
his predece&s;&s;or had treated him, in fir&s;t condemning him
to bani&s;hment, and then de&s;poiling him of his patrimony,
made him naturally think of revenge, and of recovering
his lo&s;t rights; the headlong zeal of the people hurried
him into the throne; the care of his own &s;ecurity, as
well as his ambition, made him an u&s;urper; and the
&s;teps have always been &s;o few between the pri&s;ons of
princes and their graves, that we need not wonder if
Richard's fate was no exception to the general rule. All
the&s;e con&s;iderations make Henry's &s;ituation, if he retained
any &s;en&s;e of virtue, very much to be lamented; and the
inquietude with which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his envied greatne&s;s,
<PB N="89" REF="99">
and the remor&s;es, by which it is &s;aid he was continually
haunted, render him an object of our pity, even when
&s;eated upon the throne. But it mu&s;t be owned, that his
prudence and vigilance and fore&s;ight, in maintaining his
power, were admirable: His command of temper re|markable:
His courage, both military and political,
without blemi&s;h: And he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many qualities, which
fitted him for his high &s;tation, and which rendered his
u&s;urpation of it, tho' pernicious in after times, rather
&s;alutary, during his own reign, to the Engli&s;h nation.</P>
<P>HENRY was twice married: By his fir&s;t wife, Mary
de Bohun, daughter and co-heir of the earl of Hereford,
he had four &s;ons, Henry, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the throne,
Thomas duke of Clarence, John duke of Bedford, and
Humphrey duke of Gloce&s;ter; and two daughters,
Blanche and Philippa, the former married to the duke
of Bavaria, the latter to the King of Denmark. His
&s;econd wife, Jane, whom he married after he was King,
and who was daughter to the King of Navarre, and wi|dow
of the duke of Brittany, brought him no i&s;&s;ue.</P>

<P>THE many jealou&s;ies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XIX.</NOTE> to which Henry IV's &s;itua|tion
naturally expo&s;ed him, had &s;o infected his
temper, that he had been per&s;uaded to entertain unrea|&s;onable
&s;u&s;picio$s with regard to the fidelity of his elde&s;t
&s;on;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's former di&s;|orders.</NOTE> and during the latter years of his life, he had ex|cluded
that prince from all &s;hare in public bu&s;ine&s;s, and
was even di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee him at the head of armies,
where his martial talents, tho' u&s;eful to the &s;upport of
government, acquired him a renown, which, he thought,
might prove dangerous to his own authority. The active
&s;pirit of young Henry, re&s;trained from its proper exer|ci&s;e,
broke out in extravagancies of every kind; and the
riot of plea&s;ure, the frolics of debauchery, the outrage
of wine, filled the vacancies of a mind, better adapted to
the pur&s;uits of ambition, and the cares of government.
This cour&s;e of life threw him among companions, who&s;e
di&s;orders, if accompanied with &s;pirit and humour, he &s;e|conded
and indulged; and he was detected in many &s;al|lies,
which, to &s;everer eyes, appeared totally unworthy
<PB N="91" REF="101">
of his rank and &s;tation. There even remains a tradi|tion,
that, when heated with liquor and jollity, he &s;cru|pled
not to accompany them in attacking the pa&s;&s;engers
on the &s;treets and high-ways, and de&s;poiling them of
their goods; and he found an amu&s;ement in the inci|dents,
which the terror and regret of the&s;e defencele&s;s
people produced on &s;uch occa&s;ions. This extreme of di&s;|&s;olutene&s;s
proved equally di&s;agreeable to his father, as
that eager application to bu&s;ine&s;s, which had at fir&s;t
given him occa&s;ion of jealou&s;y; and he &s;aw in his &s;on's
behaviour the &s;ame neglect of decency, the &s;ame attach|ment
to low company, which had de&s;troyed the per&s;onal
character of Richard, and which, more than all his errors
in government, had tended to overturn his throne. But
the nation in general con&s;idered the young prince with
more indulgence; and ob&s;erved &s;o many gleams of ge|nero&s;ity,
&s;pirit, and magnanimity, breaking continually
thro' the cloud, which a wild conduct threw over his
character, that they never cea&s;ed hoping for his amend|ment,
and a&s;cribed all the weeds, which &s;hot up in that
rich &s;oil, to the want of proper culture and attention in
the King and his mini&s;ters. There pa&s;&s;ed an event which
encouraged the&s;e agreeable views, and gave much occa|&s;ion
for favourable reflexions to all men of &s;en&s;e and
candour. A riotous companion of the prince's had been
indicted before Ga&s;coigne, the chief ju&s;tice, for &s;ome
di&s;orders; and Henry was not a&s;hamed to appear at the
bar with the criminal, in order to give him countenance
and protection. Finding, that his pre&s;ence had not over|awed
the chief ju&s;tice, he proceeded to in&s;ult that ma|gi&s;trate
on his tribunal; but Ga&s;coigne, mindful of the
character which he then bore, and the maje&s;ty of the
&s;overeign and of the laws, which he &s;u&s;tained, ordered
the prince to be carried to pri&s;on for his rude behaviour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 33.</NOTE>.
<PB N="92" REF="102">
The &s;pectators were agreeably di&s;appointed, when they
&s;aw the heir of the crown &s;ubmit peaceably to this &s;en|tence,
make reparation for his error by acknowledging it,
and check his impetuous nature in the mid&s;t of its extra|vagant
career.</P>
<P>THE memory of this incident, and of many others of
a like nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His re|formation.</NOTE> rendered the pro&s;pect of the future reign
no wi&s;e di&s;agreeable to the nation, and encrea&s;ed the joy,
which the death of &s;o unpopular a prince as his father,
naturally occa&s;ioned. The fir&s;t &s;teps taken by the young
King confirmed all tho&s;e prepoffe&s;&s;ions, entertained in
his favour<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ing. p. 382.</NOTE>. He called together his former companions,
acquainted them with his intended reformation, exhorted
them to imitate his example, but &s;trictly inhibited
them, till they had given proofs of their &s;incerity in
this particular, to appear any more in his pre&s;ence;
and he thus di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with liberal pre&s;ents<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 33. Holling&s;hed, p. 543. Goodwin's Life of Henry V. p. I.</NOTE>. The
wi&s;e mini&s;ters of his father, who had checked his riots,
found that they had unknowingly been paying the highe&s;t
court to him; and were received with all the marks of
favour and confidence. The chief ju&s;tice him&s;elf, who
trembled to approach the royal pre&s;ence, met with prai|&s;es,
in&s;tead of reproaches, for his pa&s;t conduct, and was
exhorted to per&s;evere in the &s;ame rigorous and impartial
execution of the laws. The &s;urprize of tho&s;e, who ex|pected
an oppo&s;ite behaviour, augmented their &s;atisfaction;
and the character of the young King appeared brighter
than if it had never been &s;haded by any errors.</P>
<P>BUT Henry was anxious not only to repair his own
mi&s;conduct, but al&s;o to make amends for tho&s;e iniqui|ties,
into which policy or the nece&s;&s;ity of affairs had be|trayed
his father. He expre&s;&s;ed the deepe&s;t &s;orrow for
<PB N="93" REF="103">
the fate of the unhappy Richard, did ju&s;tice to the me|mory
of that unfortunate prince, even performed anew
his funeral ob&s;equies with pomp and &s;olemnity, and che|ri&s;hed
all tho&s;e who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by
their loyalty and attachment towards him<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Croyland. contin. Hall, fol. 34. Holing&s;hed, p. 544.</NOTE>. In&s;tead of
continuing the re&s;traints which the jealou&s;y of his father
had impo&s;ed on the earl of Marche, he received that
young nobleman with &s;ingular courte&s;y and favour; and
by this magnanimity &s;o gained on the gentle and unambi|tious
nature of his rival, that he remained ever after &s;in|cerely
attached to him, and gave him no di&s;turbance in
his future government. The family of Piercy was re|&s;tored
to its fortune and honours<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Holing&s;hed, p. 545.</NOTE>. The King &s;eemed
ambitious
to bury all party di&s;tinctions in oblivion: The
in&s;truments of the preceding reign, who had been ad|vanced
from their blind zeal for the Lanca&s;trian intere&s;t,
more than from their merits, gave place every where to
men of more honourable characters: Virtue &s;eemed now
to have an open career, in which it might exert it&s;elf:
The exhortations, as well as example, of the prince
gave it encouragement: All men were unanimous in
their attachment to Henry; and the defects of his title
were forgot, amid&s;t the per&s;onal regard, which was uni|ver&s;ally
paid to him.</P>
<P>THERE remained among the people only one party
di&s;tinction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lol|lards.</NOTE> derived from religious differences,
and which, as it is of a peculiar and commonly a very
ob&s;tinate nature, the popularity of Henry was not able
to overcome. The Lollards were every day encrea&s;ing
in the kingdom, and were become a formed party, which
appeared extremely dangerous to the church, and even
formidable to the civil authority<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 382.</NOTE>. The enthu&s;ia&s;m by
<PB N="94" REF="104">
which the&s;e &s;ectaries were generally actuated, the great
alterations which they pretend to introduce, the hatred
which they expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the e&s;tabli&s;hed hierarchy,
gave an alarm to Henry, who, either from a &s;incere at|tachment
to the antient religion, or from the dread of
the unknown con&s;equences, which attend all important
changes, was determined to execute the laws again&s;t &s;uch
bold innovators. The head of this &s;ect was Sir John
Oldca&s;tle, lord Cobham, a nobleman, who had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
him&s;elf by his valour and his military talents,
and had, on many occa&s;ions, acquired the e&s;teem both of
the late and of the pre&s;ent King<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 382.</NOTE>. His high character
and his zeal for the new &s;ect pointed him out to Arundel,
archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, as the proper victim of eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
&s;everity; who&s;e puni&s;hment would &s;trike a terror
into the whole party, and teach them that they mu&s;t ex|pect
no mercy under the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration. He ap|plied
to Henry for a permi&s;&s;ion to indict lord Cobham<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Fox's Acts and Monuments, p. 513.</NOTE>;
but the generous nature of that prince was aver&s;e to &s;uch
&s;anguinary methods of conver&s;ion. He repre&s;ented to
the primate, that rea&s;on and conviction were the be&s;t
expedients for &s;upporting truth; that every gentle means
ought fir&s;t to be tried, in order to reclaim men from
error; and that he him&s;elf would endeavour, by a con|ver&s;ation
with Cobham, to reconcile him to the Catholic
faith. But he found that nobleman ob&s;tinate in his opi|nions,
and determined not to &s;acrifice truths of &s;uch in|finite
moment to his complai&s;ance for &s;overeigns<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ix. p. 61. Wal&s;ingham, p. 383.</NOTE>. Hen|ry's
principles of toleration, or rather his love of the
practice, could carry him no farther; and he then gave
full reins to eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;everity again&s;t this inflexible he|re&s;iarch.
The primate indicted Cobham; and with the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his three &s;uffragans, the bi&s;hops of London,
<PB N="95" REF="105">
Winche&s;ter, and St. David's, condemned him to the flames
for his erroneous opinions. Cobham, who was confined
to the Tower, made his e&s;cape before the day of his exe|cution.
The bold &s;pirit of this man, provoked by per|&s;ecution
and &s;timulated by zeal, was urged to attempt the
mo&s;t criminal enterprizes; and his unlimited authority
over the &s;ect proved, that he well merited the attention
of the civil magi&s;trate. He formed in his retreat very
violent de&s;igns again&s;t his enemies; and di&s;patching his
emi&s;&s;aries to all quarters, appointed a general rendezvous
of the party, in order to &s;eize the per&s;on of the King at
Eltham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1414.</NOTE> and put their per&s;ecutors to the &s;word<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 385.</NOTE>. Henry,
apprized of their intention, removed to We&s;tmin&s;ter:<NOTE PLACE="marg">6 January.</NOTE>
Cobham was not di&s;couraged by this di&s;appointment;
but changed the place of rendezvous to the fields near St.
Giles: The King, having &s;hut the gates of the city, to
prevent any re-inforcement to the Lollards from that
quarter, came into the fields in the night-time, &s;eized
&s;uch of the con&s;pirators as appeared, and afterwards laid
hold of the &s;everal parties, who were ha&s;tening to the
place appointed. It appeared, that few were in the &s;e|cret
of the con&s;piracy: The re&s;t implicitly followed
their leaders: But upon the trial of the pri&s;oners, the
trea&s;onable de&s;igns of the &s;ect were rendered certain,
both from evidence and from the confe&s;&s;ion of the crimi|nals
them&s;elves<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 554. Hall, fol. 35. Holing&s;hed, p. 544.</NOTE>. Some were executed; the greater
number pardoned<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ix. p. 119. 129. 193.</NOTE>. Cobham him&s;elf, who made his
e&s;cape by flight, was not brought to ju&s;tice, till four
years after; when he was hanged as a traitor; and his
body was burnt on the gibbet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Puni&s;h|ment of lord Cobham.</NOTE> in execution of the &s;en|tence
pronounced again&s;t him as a heretic<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 400. Otterbourne, p. 280. Holing&s;hed, p. 561.</NOTE>. This cri|minal
<PB N="96" REF="106">
de&s;ign, which was perhaps &s;omewhat aggravated
by the clergy, brought di&s;credit upon the party, and
checked the progre&s;s of that &s;ect, which had embraced
the &s;peculative doctrines of Wickliffe, and at the &s;ame
time a&s;pired to a reformation of eccle&s;ia&s;tical abu&s;es.</P>
<P>THESE two points were the great objects of the Lol|lards;
but the generality of the nation was not affected
in the &s;ame degree by both of them. Common &s;en&s;e
and obvious reflection had di&s;covered to the people the
advantages of a reformation in di&s;cipline; but the age
was not yet &s;o far advanced as to be &s;eized with the &s;pirit
of controver&s;y, or to enter into tho&s;e ab&s;tru&s;e doctrines,
which the Lollards endeavoured to propagate throughout
the kingdom. The very notion of here&s;y alarmed the
generality of the people: Innovation in fundamental
principles was &s;u&s;picious: Curio&s;ity was not, as yet, a
proper counter-balance to authority: And even many,
who were the greate&s;t friends to the reformation of
abu&s;es, were anxious to expre&s;s their dete&s;tation of the
&s;peculative tenets of the Wicliffites, which, they feared,
threw di&s;grace on &s;o good a cau&s;e. This turn of thought
appears evidently in the proceedings of the parliament,
which was &s;ummoned immediately after the detection of
Cobham's con&s;piracy. That a&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed &s;evere laws
again&s;t the new heretics: They enacted, that whoever
was convicted of Lollardy before the Ordinary, be&s;ides
&s;uffering capital puni&s;hment according to the laws for|merly
e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;hould al&s;o forfeit his lands and goods
to the King; and that the chancellor, trea&s;urer, ju&s;tices
of the two benches, &s;heriffs, ju&s;tices of peace, and all
the chief magi&s;trates in every city and borough, &s;hould
take an oath to u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours for the ex|tirpation
of here&s;y<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">2 Hen. V. chap. 7.</NOTE>. Yet this very parliament, when
<PB N="97" REF="107">
the King demanded &s;upply, renewed the offer formerly
pre&s;&s;ed upon his father, and entreated him to &s;eize all
the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues, and convert them to the u&s;e
of the crown<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 35.</NOTE>. The clergy were alarmed: They could
offer the King no bribe which was equivalent: They
only agreed to confer on him all the priories alien, which
depended on capital abbies in Normandy, and had been
bequeathed them when that province remained united to
England: And Chicheley, now archbi&s;hop of Canterbury,
endeavoured to divert the blow, by giving occupation to
the King, and by per&s;uading him to undertake a war
again&s;t France, in order to recover his lo&s;t rights to that
kingdom<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. fol. 35, 36.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was the dying injunction of the late King to his
&s;on, not to allow the Engli&s;h to remain long in peace,
which was apt to breed inte&s;tine commotions; but to
employ them in foreign expeditions, by which the prince
might acquire honour; the nobility, in &s;haring his dan|gers,
might attach them&s;elves to his per&s;on; and all the
re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirits find occupation for their inquietude. The
natural di&s;po&s;ition of Henry &s;ufficiently inclined him to
follow this advice, and the civil di&s;orders of France,
which had been lengthened out beyond tho&s;e of England,
opened a full career to his ambition.</P>
<P>THE death of Charles V.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1415.</NOTE> which followed &s;o &s;oon after
that of Edward III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE> and the youth of his &s;on, Charles VI.
put the two kingdoms for &s;ome time in a &s;imilar &s;ituation;
and it was not to be apprehended, that either of them,
during a minority, would be able to make much advan|tage
of the weakne&s;s of the other. The jealou&s;ies al&s;o
between Charles's three uncles, the dukes of Anjou,
Berri, and Burgundy, had di&s;tracted the affairs of France
rather more than tho&s;e between the dukes of Lanca&s;ter,
York, and Gloce&s;ter, Richard's three uncles, di&s;ordered
<PB N="98" REF="108">
tho&s;e of England; and had carried off the attention of
the French nation from any vigorous enterprize again&s;t
foreigners. But in proportion as Charles advanced in
years, the factions were compo&s;ed; his two uncles, the
dukes of Anjou and Burgundy, died; and the King
him&s;elf, a&s;&s;uming the government, gave &s;ymptoms of
genius and &s;pirit, which revived the drooping hopes of
his country. This promi&s;ing &s;tate of affairs was not of
long continuance: The unhappy prince fell &s;uddenly into
a fit of frenzy, which rendered him incapable of exer|ci&s;ing
his authority; and tho' he recovered from this di&s;|order,
he was &s;o &s;ubject to relap&s;es, that his judgment
was gradually, but &s;en&s;ibly impaired, and no &s;teady plan
of government could be pur&s;ued by him. The admini|stration
of affairs was di&s;puted between his brother,
Lewis, duke of Orleans, and his cou&s;in german, John
duke of Burgundy: The propinquity to the crown
pleaded in favour of the former: The latter, who, in
right of his mother, had inherited the county of Flan|ders,
which he annexed to his father's exten&s;ive domi|nions,
derived a lu&s;tre from his &s;uperior power: The
people were divided between the&s;e contending princes:
And the King, now re&s;uming and now dropping his
authority, kept the victory undecided, and prevented any
regular &s;ettlement of the &s;tate, by the final prevalence of
either party.</P>
<P>AT length, the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy,
&s;eeming to be moved by the cries of the nation and by the
interpo&s;ition of common friends, agreed to bury all pa&s;t
quarrels in oblivion, and to enter into &s;trict amity to|gether:
They &s;wore before the altar to the &s;incerity of
this friend&s;hip; the prie&s;t admini&s;tered the &s;acrament to
both of them; they gave to each other every pledge,
which could be deemed &s;acred among men: But all this
&s;olemn preparation was only a cover for the ba&s;e&s;t trea|chery,
<PB N="99" REF="109">
which was deliberately meditated by the duke of
Orleans. He made his rival be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in the
&s;treets of Paris: He endeavoured for &s;ome time to con|ceal
the part which he took in the crime: But being de|tected,
he embraced a re&s;olution &s;till more criminal and
more dangerous to &s;ociety, by openly avowing and ju&s;ti|fying
it<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">La Laboureur, liv. xxvii. chap. 23, 24.</NOTE>.
The parliament of Paris it&s;elf, the tribunal
of ju&s;tice, heard the harangues of the duke's advocate
in defence of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, which he denominated ty|rannicide;
and that a&s;&s;embly, partly influenced by faction,
partly overawed by power, pronounced no &s;entence of
condemnation again&s;t this dete&s;table doctrine<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid. liv. 27. chap. 27. Mon&s;trelet, chap. 39.</NOTE>. The
&s;ame que&s;tion was afterwards agitated before the council
of Con&s;tance; and it was with difficulty, that a feeble
deci&s;ion, in favour of the contrary opinion, was pro|cured
from the&s;e fathers of the church, the mini&s;ters of
peace and of religion. But the mi&s;chievous effects of
that tenet, had they been before any wi&s;e doubtful, ap|peared
&s;ufficiently from the pre&s;ent incidents. The com|mi&s;&s;ion
of this crime, which de&s;troyed all tru&s;t and &s;ecu|rity,
rendered the war implacable between the French parties,
and cut off every means of peace and accommo|dation.
The princes of the blood, con&s;piring with the young
duke of Orleans; and his brothers, made violent
war on the duke of Burgundy; and the unhappy King,
&s;eized &s;ometimes by one party, &s;ometimes by another,
transferred alternately to each of them the appearance of
legal authority. The provinces were laid wa&s;te by mutual
depredations: A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations were every where committed
from the animo&s;ity of the &s;everal leaders; or what was
equally terrible, executions were ordered without any
legal or free trial, by pretended courts of judicature.
The whole kingdom was di&s;tingui&s;hed into two parties,
<PB N="100" REF="110">
the Burgundians, and the Armagnacs; &s;o the adherents
of the young duke of Orleans were called, from the
count of Armagnac, father-in-law to that prince. The
city of Paris, di&s;tracted between them, but inclining
more to the Burgundians, was a perpetual &s;cene of blood
and violence; the King and royal family were often de|tained
captives in the hands of the populace; their faith|ful
mini&s;ters were butchered or impri&s;oned before
their
face; and it was dangerous for any man, amid&s;t the&s;e
enraged factions, to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;trict adherence
to the principles of probity and honour.</P>
<P>DURING this &s;cene of general violence, there ro&s;e into
&s;ome con&s;ideration a body of men, which u&s;ually makes
no figure in public tran&s;actions even in the mo&s;t peaceful
times; and that was the univer&s;ity of Paris, who&s;e opi|nions
were &s;ometimes required, and more frequently of|fered,
in the multiplied di&s;putes between the parties.
The &s;chi&s;m, by which the church was at that time di|vided,
and which occa&s;ioned frequent controver&s;ies in the
univer&s;ity, had rai&s;ed the ma&s;ters to an unu&s;ual degree of
importance; and this connexion between literature and
&s;uper&s;tition had be&s;towed on the former a weight to which
rea&s;on and knowledge are not, of them&s;elves, any wi&s;e
intitled among men. But there was another &s;ociety
who&s;e &s;entiments were much more deci&s;ive at Paris, the
fraternity of butchers, who, under the direction of their
ringleaders, had declared for the duke of Burgundy, and
committed the mo&s;t violent outrages again&s;t the oppo&s;ite
party. To counterbalance their power, the Armagnacs
made intere&s;t with the fraternity of carpenters; the po|pulace
ranged them&s;elves on the one &s;ide or the other;
and the fate of the capital depended on the prevalence of
either party.</P>
<P>THE advantage, which might be made of the&s;e con|fu&s;ions,
was ea&s;ily perceived in England; and according
<PB N="101" REF="111">
to the maxims, which u&s;ually prevail among nations, it
was determined to lay hold of the favourable opportunity.
The late King, who was courted by both the French
parties, fomented the quarrel, by alternately &s;ending a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
to both; but the pre&s;ent &s;overeign, impelled by
the vigour of youth and the ardour of ambition, de|termined
to pu&s;h his advantages to a greater length, and
to carry a violent war into that di&s;tracted kingdom. But
while he was making preparations for that end, he tried
to effectuate his purpo&s;e by negotiation; and he &s;ent
over amba&s;&s;adors to Paris, offering a perpetual peace and
alliance; but demanding Catharine, the French King's
daughter, in marriage, two millions of crowns as her
portion, the payment of one million &s;ix hundred thou|&s;and
as the arrears of King John's ran&s;om, and the im|mediate
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and full &s;overeignty of Normandy and
of all the other provinces, which had been ravi&s;hed from
England by the arms of Philip Augu&s;tus; together with
the &s;uperiority of Brittany and Flanders<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ix. p. 208.</NOTE>. Such exorbi|tant
demands &s;howed, that he was &s;en&s;ible of the pre&s;ent
mi&s;erable condition of France; and the terms, offered by
the French court, tho' much inferior, di&s;covered their
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;ame melancholy truth. They were
willing to give him the prince&s;s in marriage, to pay him
eight hundred thou&s;and crowns, to re&s;ign the entire &s;o|vereignty
of Guienne, and to annex to that province the
country of Perigord, Rovergue, Xaintonge, the Angou|mois,
and other territories<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 211. It is reported by &s;ome hi&s;torians (&s;ee Hi&s;t. Croyl. Cont. p. 500) that the Dauphin, in deri&s;ion of Henry's claims and di&s;|&s;olute character, &s;ent him a box of tennis balls; intimating that the&s;e implements of play were better adapted to him than the in&s;truments of war. But this &s;tory is by no means credible; the grea$ conce&s;&s;ions made by the court of France, &s;how, that they had already entertained a ju&s;t idea of Henry's character, as well as of their own &s;ituation.</NOTE>. As Henry rejected the&s;e
<PB N="102" REF="112">
conditions, and &s;carce hoped that his own demands
would be complied with, he never interrupted a mo|ment
his preparations for war, and having a&s;&s;embled a
great fleet and army at Southampton, having invited all
the nobility and military men of the kingdom to attend
him by the hopes of glory and of conque&s;t, he came to
the &s;ea-&s;ide, with a purpo&s;e of embarking on his expe|dition.</P>
<P>BUT while Henry was meditating conque&s;ts upon his
neighbours, he unexpectedly found him&s;elf in danger
from a con&s;piracy at home, which was happily detected
in its infancy. The earl of Cambridge, &s;econd &s;on of
the late duke of York, having e&s;pou&s;ed the &s;i&s;ter of the
earl of Marche, had zealou&s;ly embraced the intere&s;ts of
that family; and had held &s;ome conferences with the
lord Scrope of Ma&s;ham, and Sir Thomas Grey of Heton,
about the means of recovering to that nobleman his ju&s;t
right to the crown of England. The con&s;pirators, &s;o
&s;oon as they were detected, acknowledged their guilt to
the King<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ix. p. 300. T. Livii, p. 8.</NOTE>; and Henry proceeded without delay to their
trial and condemnation. The utmo&s;t that could be ex|pected
of the be&s;t King in tho&s;e ages, was, that he
would &s;o far ob&s;erve the e&s;&s;entials of ju&s;tice, as not to
make an innocent per&s;on a victim to his &s;everity: But
as to the formalities of law, which are often as mate|rial
as the e&s;&s;entials them&s;elves, they were &s;acrificed
without &s;cruple to the lea&s;t intere&s;t or convenience. A
jury of commoners was &s;ummoned: The three con&s;pi|rators
were indicted before them: The con&s;table of South|ampton
ca&s;tle &s;wore, that they had &s;eparately confe&s;&s;ed their
guilt to him: Without other evidence, Sir Thomas
Gray was condemned and executed: But as the earl of
Cambridge and lord Scrope, pleaded the privilege of
<PB N="103" REF="113">
their peerage, Henry thought proper to &s;ummon a court
of eighteen barons, in which the duke of Clarence pre|&s;ided:
The evidence, given before the jury, was read
to them: The pri&s;oners, tho' one of them was a prince,
of the blood, were not examined, nor produced in
court, nor heard in their own defence; but received
&s;entence of death upon this proof, which was every way
irregular and illegal; and the &s;entence was &s;oon after
executed. The earl of Marche was accu&s;ed of having
given his approbation to this con&s;piracy, and received
a general pardon from the King<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ix. p. 303.</NOTE>. He was probably ei|ther
innocent of the crime imputed to him, or had made
reparation by his early repentance and di&s;covery<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. iv. Godwin, p. 65.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;&s;es, which the arms of England have,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion of France.</NOTE> in
different ages, obtained over tho&s;e of France, have been
much owing to the favourable &s;ituation of the former
kingdom. The Engli&s;h, happily &s;eated in an i&s;land,
could make advantage of every mi&s;fortune which attend|ed
their neighbours, and were little expo&s;ed to the dan|ger
of retaliation. They never left their own country,
but when conducted by a King of extraordinary genius,
or found their enemy divided by inte&s;tine factions, or
were &s;upported by a powerful alliance on the con$inent;
and as all the&s;e circum&s;tances concurred at pre&s;ent to fa|vour
their enterprize, they had rea&s;on to expect from it
a proportionable &s;ucce&s;s. The duke of Burgundy, expel|led
France by a combination of the princes, had been
&s;ecretly &s;oliciting the alliance of England<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ix. p. 137, 138.</NOTE>; and Henry
knew, that that prince, tho' he &s;crupled at fir&s;t to join
the inveterate enemy of his country, would willingly, if
he &s;aw any probability of &s;ucce&s;s, both a&s;&s;i&s;t him with
his Flemi&s;h &s;ubjects, and draw over to the &s;ame cau&s;e
<PB N="104" REF="114">
all his numerous partizans in France. Tru&s;ting there|fore
to this circum&s;tance, but without e&s;tabli&s;hing any
concert with the duke, he put to &s;ea, and landed near
Harfleur,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th Au|gust.</NOTE> at the head of an army of 6000 men at arms,
and 24,000 foot, mo&s;tly archers. He immediately began
the &s;iege of that place, which was valiantly defended by
the lords d'E&s;to&ucirc;ville, de Guitri, de Gaucourt, and
others of the French nobility: But as the garri&s;on was
weak, and the fortifications in bad repair, they were at
la&s;t obliged to capitulate; and they promi&s;ed to &s;urrender
if they received no &s;uccour before the eighteenth of Sep|tember.
The day came, and there was no appearance
of a French army to relieve them: Yet they &s;till de|layed,
on various pretences, to open their gates; till
Henry, incen&s;ed at their breach of faith, ordered a general
a&s;&s;ault, took the town by &s;torm, and put all the garri&s;on
to the &s;word; except &s;ome gentlemen, whom the victo|rious
army, in hopes of reaping profit by their ran&s;om,
were induced to &s;pare<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">De Laboureur, liv. 35. chap. 4, 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE fatigues of this &s;iege, and the unu&s;ual heat of the
&s;ea&s;on, had &s;o wa&s;ted the Engli&s;h army, that Henry
could enter on no farther enterprize. and was obliged to
think of returning into England. He had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his
tran&s;ports, which could not &s;afely anchor in an open
road upon the enemy's coa&s;t: and he lay under a nece&s;|&s;ity
of marching by land to Calais, before he could reach
a place of &s;afety. A numerous French army of 14,000
men at arms and 40,000 foot was by this time a&s;&s;embled
in Normandy under the con&s;table d' Albert; a force,
which, if prudently conducted, was &s;ufficient either to
trample down the Engli&s;h in the open field, or to har|ra&s;s
and reduce to nothing their &s;mall army, before they
could fini&s;h &s;o long and difficult a march. Henry, there|fore,
<PB N="105" REF="115">
very cautiou&s;ly offered to &s;acrifice his conque&s;t of
Harfleur for a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age to Calais; but his propo&s;al
being rejected by the French court, he determined to
force his way by valour and policy thro' all the oppo|&s;ition
of the enemy<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Laboureur, liv. 35. chap. 6.</NOTE>. That he might not di&s;courage his
own army by the appearance of flight, or expo&s;e them to
tho&s;e hazards which naturally attend precipitate marches,
he made very &s;low and deliberate journies<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">T. Livii, p. 12.</NOTE>, till he reach|ed
the Somme, which he propo&s;ed to pa&s;s at the ford of
Blanquetague, the &s;ame place where Edward, in a like
&s;ituation, had before e&s;caped from Philip de Valois. But
he found the ford rendered impa&s;&s;able by the precaution of
the French general, and guarded by a &s;trong body on the
oppo&s;ite bank<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 58.</NOTE>; and he was therefore obliged to march
higher up the river, in order to &s;eek for a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age.
He was continually harra&s;&s;ed on his march by flying
parties of the enemy; &s;aw bodies of troops on the other
&s;ide ready to oppo&s;e every attempt; his provi&s;ions were
cut off; his &s;oldiers langui&s;hed with &s;ickne&s;s and fatigue;
and his affairs &s;eemed to be reduced to a de&s;perate &s;itua|tion:
When he was &s;o dexterous or &s;o fortunate as to
&s;eize by &s;urprize a pa&s;&s;age near St. Quintin, which had
not been &s;ufficiently guarded, and he &s;afely carried over
his army<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">T. Livii, p. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY then bent his march northwards to Calais;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Azincour.</NOTE>
but he was &s;till expo&s;ed to great and imminent danger
from the enemy, who had al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed the Somme, and
threw them&s;elves full in his way, with a purpo&s;e of in|tercepting
his retreat. After he had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;mall
river of Ternois at Blangi,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th Octr.</NOTE> he was &s;urprized to ob&s;erve
from the heights the whole French army drawn up in
the plains of Azincour, and &s;o po&s;ted that it was impo&s;|&s;ible
<PB N="106" REF="116">
for him to proceed on his march, without coming
to an engagement. Nothing in appearance could be
more unequal than the battle upon which all his &s;afety
and his fortunes depended. The Engli&s;h army were
little more than half the number, which had di&s;embarked
at Harffieur; and they laboured under every di&s;courage|ment
and nece&s;&s;ity. The enemy were four times more
numerous; were headed by the Dauphin and all the
princes of the blood; and were plentifully &s;upplied with
provi&s;ions of every kind. Henry's &s;ituation was exactly
&s;imilar to that of Edward at Cre&s;&s;y, and that of the Black
Prince at Poictiers; and the memory of the&s;e great
events, in&s;piring the Engli&s;h with courage, made them
hope for a like deliverance from their pre&s;ent difficulties.
The King likewi&s;e ob&s;erved the &s;ame prudent conduct
which had been followed by the&s;e great commanders.
He drew up his army on a narrow ground between two
woods, which guarded each flank; and he patiently ex|pected
in that po&s;ture the attack of the enemy<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 62.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAD the French con&s;table been able, either to rea&s;on
ju&s;tly upon the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of the two armies,
or to profit by pa&s;t experience, he had declined a com|bat,
and had waited till nece&s;&s;ity, obliging the Engli&s;h
to advance, had made them relinqui&s;h the advantages of
their &s;ituation. But the impetuous valour of the French
nobility, and a vain confidence in &s;uperior numbers,
brought on this fatal action, which proved the &s;ource of
infinite calamities to their country. The French archers
on hor&s;eback and their men at arms, crowded in their
ranks, advanced upon the Engli&s;h archers, who had
fixed palli&s;adoes in their front to break the impre&s;&s;ion of
the enemy, and who &s;afely plyed them, from behind that
defence, with a &s;hower of arrows, which nothing could
<PB N="107" REF="117">
re&s;i&s;t<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 392. T. Livii, p. 19. La Laboureur, liv. 35. chap. 7. Mon&s;trelet, chap. 147.</NOTE>. The clay &s;oil, moi&s;tened by &s;ome rain, which
had lately fallen, proved another ob&s;tacle to the force of
the French cavalry: The wounded men and hor&s;es di&s;|compo&s;ed
their ranks: The narrow compa&s;s, in which
they were pent, hindered them from recovering any or|der:
The whole army was a &s;cene of confu&s;ion, terror,
and di&s;may: And Henry, perceiving his advantage, or|dered
the Engli&s;h, archers, who were light and unimcum|bered,
to advance upon the enemy, and &s;eize the mo|ment
of victory. They fell with their battle-axes upon
the French, who, in their pre&s;ent po&s;ture, were incapable
either of flying or of making defence: They hewed them
in pieces without re&s;i&s;tance<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Wal&s;ingham, p. 393. Ypod. Neu&s;t. p. 584.</NOTE>. And being &s;econded by
the men at arms, who al&s;o pu&s;hed on again&s;t the enemy,
they covered the field with the killed, wounded, di&s;|mounted,
and overthrown. After all appearance of op|po&s;ition
was over, the Engli&s;h had lei&s;ure to make pri|&s;oners;
and having advanced with uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;s
to the open plain, they there &s;aw the remains of the
French rear-guard, which &s;till maintained the appearance
of a line of battle. At the &s;ame time, they heard an
alarm from behind: Some gentlemen of Picardy, having
collected about 600 pea&s;ants, had fallen upon the Eng|li&s;h
baggage, and were doing execution on the di&s;|armed
followers of the camp, who fled before them.
Henry, &s;eeing the enemy on all &s;ides of him, began to
entertain apprehen&s;ions from his pri&s;oners; and he
thought it nece&s;&s;ary to i&s;&s;ue general orders for putting
them to death<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">T. Livii, p. 20. Le Laboureur, liv. 35. chap. 7. Sr. Remi, chap. 62. Mon&s;trelet, chap. 147. Hall, fol. 50.</NOTE>: But on the di&s;covery of the truth, he
&s;topped the &s;laughter, and was &s;till able to &s;ave a great
number.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="118">
No battle was ever more fatal to France, by the num|ber
of princes and nobility, &s;lain or taken pri&s;oners.
Among the former were the con&s;table him&s;elf, the count
de Nevers and the duke of Brabant, brothers to the duke
of Burgundy, the count de Vaudemont, brother to the
duke of Lorraine, the duke of Alen&ccedil;on, the duke of

were the dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, the counts

<P>THE three great battles of Cre&s;&s;y, Poictiers, and A|zincour
bore a &s;ingular re&s;emblance to each other, in their
mo&s;t con&s;iderable circum&s;tances. In all of them, there
appears the &s;ame temeritty in the Engli&s;h princes, who,
without any object of moment, merely for the &s;ake of
plunder, had ventured &s;o far into the enemies country as
to leave them&s;elves no re&s;ource; and unle&s;s &s;aved by the
utmo&s;t imprudence in the French commanders, were,
<PB N="109" REF="119">
from their very &s;ituation, expo&s;ed to inevitable de&s;truc|tion.
But allowance being made for this temeriy, which,
according to the irregular plans of war, followed in tho&s;e
ages, &s;eems to have been, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, unavoidable;
there appears, in the day of action, the &s;ame pre&s;ence of
mind, dexterity, courage, firmne&s;s, and precaution on
the part of the Engli&s;h: The &s;ame precipitation, confu|&s;ion,
and vain confidence on the part of the French:
And the events were &s;uch as might have been expected
from &s;uch oppo&s;ite conduct. The immediate con&s;e|quences
too of the&s;e three great victories were &s;imilar:
In&s;tead of pu&s;hing the French with vigour, and taking
advantage of their con&s;ternation, the Engli&s;h princes,
after their victory, &s;eem rather to have relaxed their
efforts, and to have allowed the enemy lei&s;ure to recover
from his lo&s;&s;es. Henry interrupted not his march a mo|ment
after the battle of Azincour; he carried his pri|&s;oners
to Calais, and from thence to England; he even
concluded a truce with the enemy; and it was not till
after an interval of two years that any body of Engli&s;h
troops appeared in France.</P>
<P>THE poverty of all the European princes, and the
&s;mall re&s;ources of their kingdoms, were the cau&s;es of
the&s;e continual interruptions in their ho&s;tilities; and
tho' the maxims of war were in general very de&s;tructive,
their military operations were mere incur&s;ions, which,
without any &s;ettled plan, they carried on again&s;t each
other. The lu&s;tre, however, attending the victory of
Azincour, procured &s;ome &s;upplies from the Engli&s;h par|liament;
tho' &s;till unequal to the expences of a campaign.
They granted Henry an entire fifteenth of moveables;
and they conferred on him <HI>for life</HI> the duties of tonnage
and poundage, and the &s;ub&s;idies on the exportation of
wool and leather. This conce&s;&s;ion is more con&s;iderable
than that which had been granted to Richard II. by his
<PB N="110" REF="120">
la&s;t parliament, and which was afterwards, on his depo|&s;ition,
made &s;o great an article of charge again&s;t him.</P>
<P>BUT during this interruption of ho&s;tilities from Eng|land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE>
France was expo&s;ed to all the furies of civil war;
and the &s;everal parties became every day more enraged
again&s;t each other. The duke of Burgundy, in hopes
that the French mini&s;ters and generals were entirely di&s;|credited,
by the misfortune at Azincour, advanced with
a great army to Paris, and attempted to re-in&s;tate him|&s;elf
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the government, as well as of the
King's per&s;on. But his partizans in that city were over|awed
by the court, and kept in &s;ubjection: The duke
de&s;paired of &s;ucce&s;s: And he retired with his forces,
which he immediately di&s;per&s;ed in the Low Countries<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Le Laboureur, liv. 35. chap. 10.</NOTE>.
He was next year invited to make a new attempt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1416.</NOTE> by
&s;ome violent quarrels, which broke out in the royal
family. The Queen, I&s;abella, daughter of the duke of
Bavaria, who had been hitherto an inveterate enemy to
the Burgundian faction, had received a great injury from
the other party, which the implacable &s;pirit of that
prince&s;s was never able to forgive. The public nece&s;|&s;ities
obliged the count d'Armagnac, created con&s;table of
France in place of d' Albert, to &s;eize the great trea&s;ures
which I&s;abella had ama&s;&s;ed; and when &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her
di&s;plea&s;ure at this injury, he in&s;pired into the weak
mind of the King &s;ome jealou&s;ies again&s;t her conduct,
and pu&s;hed him to &s;eize and put to the torture, and after|wards
throw into the Seine, Bois-bourdon, her favourite,
whom he accu&s;ed of a commerce of gallantry with that
prince&s;s. The Queen her&s;elf was &s;ent to Tours, and
confined under a guard<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 74.</NOTE>; and after the&s;e multiplied
in&s;ults, &s;he no longer &s;crupled to enter into a corre&s;|pondence
<PB N="111" REF="121">
with the duke of Burgundy. As her &s;on, the
Dauphin Charles, a youth of &s;ixteen, was entirely go|verned
by the faction of Armagnac, &s;he extended her
animo&s;ity to him, and &s;ought his destruction with the
mo&s;t unrelenting hatred. She had &s;oon an opportunity
of rendering her unnatural purpo&s;e effectual. The duke
of Burgundy, in concert with her, entered France at the
head of a great army: He made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of
Amiens, Abbeville, Dourlens, Montre&uuml;il, and other
towns in Picardy; Senlis, Rheims, Chalons, Troye,
and Auxerre, declared them&s;elves for his party<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 79.</NOTE>. He
got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Beaumont, Pontoi&s;e, Vernon, Meulant,
Montlheri, towns in the neighbourhood of Paris; and
carrying farther his progre&s;s towards the we&s;t, he &s;eized
Etampes, Chartres, and other fortre&s;&s;es; and was at la&s;t
able to deliver the Queen, who fled to Troye, and de|clared
openly again&s;t tho&s;e mini&s;ters, who, &s;he &s;aid,
detained her hu&s;band in captivity<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 81. Mon&s;trelet, chap. 178, 179.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEAN-WHILE, the partizans of Burgundy rai&s;ed a
commotion in Paris, which always inclined to that fac|tion.
Lile-Adam, one of the duke's captains, was re|ceived
into the city in the night-time, and headed the
in&s;urrectiion of the people, which in a moment became
&s;o impetuous, that nothing could oppo&s;e it. The per|&s;on
of the King was &s;eized: The Dauphin made his
e&s;cape with difficulty: Great numbers of the faction of
Armagnac were immediately butchered: The count
him&s;elf, and many per&s;ons of note, were thrown into
pri&s;on: Murders were daily committed from private ani|mo&s;ity,
under pretence of faction: And the populace, not
&s;atiated with their fury, and deeming the cour&s;e of public
ju&s;tice too dilatory, broke open the pri&s;ons, and put to
<PB N="112" REF="122">
death the count d'Armagnac, and all the other nobility
who were there confined<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 85, 86. Mon&s;trelet, chap. 118.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE France was in &s;uch furious combu&s;tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1417.</NOTE> and
was &s;o ill prepared to re&s;i&s;t a foreign enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New inva|&s;ion of France. 11&s;t Augu&s;t.</NOTE> Henry, hav|ing
collected &s;ome trea&s;ures, and levied an army, landed
in Normandy at the head of 25,000 men; and met with
no con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition from any quarter. He made
him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Falai&s;e and Cherbourg; Evreux and
Caen &s;ubmitted to him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1418.</NOTE> Pont de l'Arche opened its

and received a reinforcement of 15000 men

defended by a garri&s;on of 4000 men, &s;econded by the
inhabitants, to the number of 15000<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 91.</NOTE>. The cardinal
des Ur&s;ins here attempted to incline him towards peace,
and to moderate his preten&s;ions: But the King replied
to him in &s;uch terms as &s;hewed that he was fully &s;en|&s;ible
of all his pre&s;ent advantages: &startq;Do you not &s;ee,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;that God has led me hither as by the hand?

that kingdom: Every thing is here in the utmo&s;t con|fu&s;ion:
No one thinks of re&s;i&s;ting me. Can I have a
more &s;en&s;ible proof, that that Being, who di&s;po&s;es of
empires, has determined to put the crown of France
upon my head?&endq;<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Juvenal des Ur&s;ins.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' Henry had opened his mind to this &s;cheme
of ambition, he &s;till continued to negotiate with his ene|mies,
and endeavoured to obtain more &s;ecure, tho' le&s;s
con&s;iderable advantages. He made, at the &s;ame time,
offers of peace to both parties; to the Queen and duke
<PB N="113" REF="123">
of Burgundy on the one hand, who having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the King's per&s;on, carried the appearance of legal autho|rity<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ix. p. 717. 749.</NOTE>; and to the Dauphin on the other, who being the
undoubted heir of the monarchy, was adhered to by
every one that had a regard to the true intere&s;ts of their
country<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. ix. p. 626, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
The&s;e two parties al&s;o carried on a continual
negotiation with each other. The terms propo&s;ed on
all &s;ides were perpetually varying: The events of the
war, and the intrigues of the cabinet, intermingled with
each other: And the fate of France remained long in
this uncertainty. After many negotiations, Henry offered
the Queen and the duke of Burgundy to make peace
with them, to e&s;pou&s;e the prince&s;s Catharine, to accept
of all the provinces ceded to Edward III. by the treaty
of Bretigni, with the addition of Normandy, which he
was to receive in full and entire &s;overeignty<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. ix. p. 762.</NOTE>. The&s;e
terms were accepted of:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1419.</NOTE> There remained only &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances
to adju&s;t, in order to the full completion of
the treaty: But in this interval the duke of Burgundy
&s;ecretly fini&s;hed his treaty with the Dauphin; and the&s;e
two princes agreed to &s;hare the royal authority during
King Charles's life, and to unite their arms in expelling
foreign enemies<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. ix. p. 776. St. Remi, chap. 95.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS alliance, which &s;eemed to cut off from Henry
all hopes of farther &s;ucce&s;s, proved in the i&s;&s;ue the mo&s;t
favourable event which could have happened for his pre|ten&s;ions.
Whether the Dauphin and duke of Burgundy
were ever &s;incere in their mutual engagements is un|certain;
but very fatal effects re&s;ulted from their
momentary and &s;eeming union. The two princes
agreed to an interview, in order to concert the means
<PB N="114" REF="124">
of rendering effectual their common attack of the Eng|li&s;h;
but how both or either of them could with &s;afety
venture upon this conference, it &s;eemed &s;omewhat
difficult to contrive. The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination perpetrated by
the duke of Burgundy, and &s;till more, his open avowal
of the deed, and defence of the doctrine, tended to
di&s;&s;olve all the bands of civil &s;ociety; and even men of
honour, who dete&s;ted the example, might deem it ju&s;t,
on a favourable opportunity, to retaliate upon the au|thor.
The duke, therefore, who neither dared to give,
nor could pretend to require any tru&s;t, agreed to all the
contrivances for mutual &s;ecurity, which were propo&s;ed
by the mini&s;ters of the Dauphin. The two princes
came to Montereau: The duke lodged in the ca&s;tle;
the Dauphin in the town, which was divided from the
ca&s;tle by the river Yonne: The bridge between them
was cho&s;en for the place of interview: Two high rails
were drawn acro&s;s the bridge: The gates on each &s;ide
were guarded, the one by the officers of the dauphin, the
other by tho&s;e of the duke: The princes were to enter
into the intermediate &s;pace by the oppo&s;ite gates, accom|panied
each by ten per&s;ons; and with all the&s;e marks
of diffidence, to conciliate their mutual friend&s;hip. But
it appeared, that no precautions are &s;ufficient, where
laws have no place, and where all principles of honour
are utterly abandoned. Tannegui de Chatel, and others
of the Dauphin's retainers, were zealous partizans of the
hou&s;e of Orleans,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the duke of Burgundy.</NOTE> and they determined to &s;eize the oppor|tunity
of revenging on the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in the murder of that
prince. They no &s;ooner entered the rails, than they drew
their &s;words and attacked the duke of Burgundy: His
friends were a&s;toni&s;hed, and thought not of making any
defence; and all of them either &s;hared his fate, or were
taken pri&s;oners by the retinue of the Dauphin<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 97. Mon&s;trele$, chap. 211.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="125">
THE extreme youth of this prince, made it doubtful
whether he was admitted into the &s;ecret of the con&s;pi|racy:
But as the deed was committed under his eye'
by his mo&s;t intimate friends, who &s;till retained their con|nexions
with him, the blame of the action, which was
certainly more imprudent than criminal, fell entirely up|on
him. The whole &s;tate of affairs was every where
changed by that unexpected incident. The city of
Paris, which was pa&s;&s;ionately devoted to the family of
Burgundy, broke out into the highe&s;t fury again&s;t
the Dauphin. The court of King Charles entered from in|tere&s;t
into the &s;ame views; and as all the mini&s;ters about
that monarch had owed their preferment to the late duke,
and fore&s;aw their downfall if the Dauphin recovered po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of his father's per&s;on, they were concerned to pre|vent
by any means the &s;ucce&s;s of his enterprize. The
Queen, per&s;evering in her unnatural animo&s;ity again&s;t her
&s;on, encrea&s;ed the general flame, and in&s;pired into the
King, as far as he was &s;u&s;ceptible of any &s;entiment,
the &s;ame prejudices by which &s;he her&s;elf had long been
actuated. But above all, Philip count de Charolois,
now duke of Burgundy, thought him&s;elf bound by every
tye of honour and of duty, to revenge the murder of his
father, and to pro&s;ecute the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in to the utmo&s;t extre|mity.
And in this general tran&s;port of rage, every con|&s;ideration
of national and family intere&s;t was buried in
oblivion by all parties: The &s;ubjection to a foreign
enemy, the expul&s;ion of the lawful heir, the &s;lavery of
the kingdom, appeared but &s;mall evils, if they led to the
gratification of the pre&s;ent pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE King of England had, before the death of the
duke of Burgundy, profited extremely by the di&s;tractions
of France, and was daily making a con&s;iderable progre&s;s
in Normandy. He had taken Ro&uuml;en after an ob&s;tinate
<PB N="116" REF="126">
&s;iege<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">T. Livii, p. 69. Mon&s;trelet, chap. 201.</NOTE>. He had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Pontoi&s;e and
Gi&s;ors: He even threatened Paris, and by the terror of
his power, had obliged the court to remove to Troye:
And in the mid&s;t of his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, he was agreeably &s;ur|pri&s;ed,
to find his enemies, in&s;tead of combining again&s;t
him for their mutual defence, di&s;po&s;ed to ru&s;h into his
arms, and to make him the in&s;trument of their vengeance
upon each other. A league was immediately concluded
at Arras between him and the duke of Burgundy. That
prince, without &s;tipulating any thing for him&s;elf, except
the pro&s;ecution of his father's murder, and the marriage
of the duke of Bedford with his &s;i&s;ter, was willing to &s;a|crifice
the kingdom to Henry's ambition, and he agreed
to every demand, which was made by that monarch. In
order to fini&s;h that a&s;toni&s;hing treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1420.</NOTE> which was to tran&s;|fer
the crown of France to a &s;tranger, Henry went to
Troye, accompanied by his brothers, the dukes of Cla|rence
and Gloce&s;ter; and was there met by the duke of
Burgundy. The imbecility, into which Charles had
fallen, made him incapable of &s;eeing any thing but thro'
the eyes of tho&s;e who attended him; as they, on their
part, &s;aw every thing thro' the medium of their pa&s;&s;ions.
The treaty, being already concerted among the parties,
was immediately drawn and &s;igned and ratified: Henry's
will &s;eemed to be a law throughout this whole negotia|tion:
Nothing was attended to but his advantages.</P>
<P>THE principal articles of the treaty were, that Henry
&s;hould e&s;pou&s;e the prince&s;s Catharine:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty of Troye.</NOTE> That King
Charles, during his lifetime, &s;hould enjoy the title and
dignity of King of France: That Henry &s;hould be de|clared
and acknowledged heir of the monarchy, and be
entru&s;ted with the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration of the govern|ment:
That that kingdom &s;hould pa&s;s to his heirs gene|ral:
That France and England &s;hould for ever be united
<PB N="117" REF="127">
under one Kings; but &s;hould &s;till retain their &s;everal
u&s;ages, cu&s;toms, and privileges: That all the princes,
peers, va&s;&s;als, and communities of France, &s;hould &s;wear,
both that they would adhere to the future &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
Henry, and pay him pre&s;ent obedience as regent: That
that prince &s;hould unite his arms to tho&s;e of King Charles
and the duke of Burgundy, in order to &s;ubdue the ad|herents
of Charles, the pretended Dauphin: And that
the&s;e three princes &s;hould make no peace nor truce with
him but by common con&s;ent and agreement<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ix. p. 895. St. Remi, chap. 101. Mon&s;trelet, chap. 223.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUCH was the tenor of this famous treaty; a treaty,
which as nothing but the mo&s;t violent animo&s;ity could
dictate, &s;o nothing but the power of the &s;word could carry
it into execution. It is hard to &s;ay, whether its con&s;e|quences,
had it taken place, would have proved more
pernicious to England or to France. It mu&s;t have re|duced
the former kingdom to the rank of a province: It
would have entirely disjointed the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the latter
monarchy, and have brought on the de&s;truction of every
de&s;cendant of the royal family: As the hou&s;es of Orleans,
Anjou, Alencon, Brittany, Bourbon, and of Burgundy
it&s;elf, who&s;e titles were preferable to that of the Engli&s;h
princes, would on that account have been expo&s;ed to per|petual
jealou&s;y and per&s;ecution from the &s;overeign.
There was even a palpable deficiency in Henry's claim,
which no art could palliate. For be&s;ides the in&s;uperable
objections, to which Edward IIId's preten&s;ions were ex|po&s;ed,
<HI>he</HI> was not heir to that monarch: If female &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
was admitted, the right had devolved to the hou&s;e
of Mortimer: Allowing, that Richard II. was a tyrant,
and that Henry IVth's merits, in depo&s;ing him, were &s;o
great towards the Engli&s;h, as to ju&s;tify that nation for
placing him on the throne; Richard had nowi&s;e offended
<PB N="118" REF="128">
France, and his rival had merited nothing of that king|dom:
It could not po&s;&s;ibly be pretended, that the crown
of France was become an appendage to that of England;
and that a prince, who, by any means, got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the latter, was, without farther que&s;tion, intitled to the
former. So that on the whole, it mu&s;t be allowed, that
Henry's claim to France was, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more unin|telligible,
than the title, by which his father had mounted
the throne of England.</P>
<P>BUT tho' all the&s;e con&s;iderations were overlooked,
amid&s;t the hurry of pa&s;&s;ions, by which the courts of
France and Burgundy were actuated, they would nece&s;|&s;arily
revive during times of more lei&s;ure and tranquillity;
and it behoved Henry to pu&s;h his pre&s;ent advantages,
and allow men no lei&s;ure for rea&s;on or reflection. In a
few days after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the King.</NOTE> he e&s;pou&s;ed the prince&s;s, Catharine: He
carried his father-in-law to Paris, and put him&s;elf in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that capital: He obtained from the parlia|ment
and the three e&s;tates a ratification of the treaty of Troye: He &s;upported the duke of Burgundy in pro|curing
a &s;entence again&s;t the murderers of his father:
And he immediately turned his arms with &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t
the adherents of the Dauphin, who, &s;o &s;oon as he heard
of the treaty of Troye, took on him the &s;tyle and autho|rity
of regent, and appealed to God and his &s;word for
the maintenance of his title.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t place which Henry &s;ubdued, was Sens,
which opened its gates after a &s;light re&s;i&s;tance. With the
&s;ame facility, he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Montereau.
The defence of Melun was more ob&s;tinate; Barba&s;an,
the governor, held out for the &s;pace of four months
again&s;t the be&s;iegers; and it was famine alone which
obliged him to capitulate. Henry promi&s;ed to &s;pare the
lives of all the garri&s;on, except &s;uch as were accomplices
in the murder of the duke of Burgundy; and as Barba&s;an
him&s;elf was &s;u&s;pected to be of the number, his puni&s;h|ment
<PB N="119" REF="129">
was demanded by Philip: But the King had the
genero&s;ity to intercede for him, and to prevent his execu|tion<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 577.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity of providing &s;upplies both of men and
money obliged Henry to go over to England;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1421.</NOTE> and he
left the duke of Exeter, his uncle, governor of Paris
during his ab&s;ence. The authority, which naturally at|tends
&s;ucce&s;s, procured him from the Engli&s;h parlia|ment
a &s;ub&s;idy of a fifteenth; but if we may judge by
the &s;mallne&s;s of this &s;upply, the nation was nowi&s;e &s;an|guine
on their King's victories; and in proportion as the
pro&s;pect of their union with France came nearer, they
began to open their eyes, and to &s;ee the dangerous con&s;e|quences
with which it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be attended. It
was fortunate for Henry, that he had other re&s;ources,
be&s;ides pecuniary &s;upplies from his native &s;ubjects. The
provinces, which he had already conquered, maintained
his troops; and the hopes of farther advantages allured,
to his &s;tandard all men of ambitious &s;pirits in England,
who de&s;ired to &s;ignalize them&s;elves by arms. He a&s;&s;em|bled
a new army of twenty four thou&s;and archers, and
four thou&s;and hor&s;emen<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, chap. 242.</NOTE>, and marched them to Dover,
the place of embarkation. Every thing had remained in
tranquillity at Paris, under the duke of Exeter; but there
had happened in another quarter of the kingdom a mi&s;|fortune,
which ha&s;tened his departure.</P>
<P>THE detention of the King of Scots in England had
hitherto proved very advantageous to Henry; and by
keeping the regent in awe, had pre&s;erved, during the
whole cour&s;e of the French war, the northern frontier in
tranquillity. But when intelligence arrived in Scotland,
of the progre&s;s made by Henry, and the near pro&s;pect of
his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of France, the nation was
<PB N="120" REF="130">
alarmed, and fore&s;aw their own inevitable ruin, if the
&s;ubjection of their ally left them to combat alone an
enemy, who was already &s;o much &s;uperior to them in
power and riches. The regent entered into the &s;ame
views; and tho' he declined an open war with Eng|land,
he permitted a body of &s;even thou&s;and Scots, un|der
the command of the earl of Buchan, his &s;econd &s;on,
to be tran&s;ported into France for the &s;ervice of the Dau|phin.
To render this aid ineffectual, Henry had carried
over the young King of Scots, whom he obliged to &s;end
orders to his countrymen to leave the French &s;ervice;
but the Scots general replied, that he would obey no
commands which came from a King in captivity, and
that a prince, while in the hands of his enemy, was no|wi&s;e
entitled to authority. The&s;e troops, therefore, con|tinued
&s;till to act under the earl of Buchan; and were
employed by the Dauphin to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of the
duke of Clarence in Anjou. The two armies encoun|tered
at Baug&eacute;: The Engli&s;h were defeated: The duke
him&s;elf was &s;lain by Sir Allan Swinton, a Scots knight,
who commanded a company of men at arms: And the
earls of Somer&s;et<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">His name was John, and he was afterwards created duke of &s;o|mer&s;et. He was grand&s;on of John of Gaunt duke of Lanca&s;ter. The earl of Dor&s;et was brother to Somer&s;et, and &s;ucceeded him in that title.</NOTE>. Dor&s;et, and Huntingdon, were
taken pri&s;oners<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 110. Mon&s;trelet, chap. 239. Hall, fol. 76.</NOTE>. This was the fir&s;t action, which
turned the tide of &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the Engli&s;h; and the
Dauphin, that he might both attach the Scots to his
&s;ervice, and reward the valour and conduct of the earl
of Buchan, honoured that nobleman with the office of
con&s;table.</P>
<P>BUT the arrival of the King of England, with &s;o
con&s;iderable an army, was more than &s;ufficient to repair
<PB N="121" REF="131">
this lo&s;s. Henry was received at Paris with great expre&s;|&s;ions
of joy; &s;o ob&s;tinate were the prejudices of the peo|ple:
And he immediately conducted his army to Chartres,
which had long been be&s;ieged by the Dauphin. That
prince decamped on the approach of the Engli&s;h; and
being re&s;olved to decline a battle, he retired with his
army<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 3.</NOTE>. Henry made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Dreux without
a blow: He laid &s;iege to Meaux at the &s;ollicitation of
the Pari&s;ians, who were much incommoded by the gar|ri&s;on
of that place. This enterprize employed the Eng|lish
arms during the &s;pace of eight months: The ba&s;tard
of Vaurus, the governor of Meaux, di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf
by an ob&s;tinate defence; but was at la&s;t obliged to
&s;urrender at di&s;cretion. The cruelty of this officer was
equal to his bravery: He was accu&s;tomed to hang with|out
di&s;tinction all the Engli&s;h and Burgundians who fell
into his hands: And Henry, in revenge of his barba|rity,
ordered him immediately to be hanged on the &s;ame
tree, which he had made the in&s;trument of his inhuman
executions<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. x. p. 212. T. Livii, p. 93, 93. St. Remi, chap. 116. Mon&s;trelet, chap. 260.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS &s;ucce&s;s was followed by the &s;urrender of many
other places in the neighbourhood of Paris, which held
for the Dauphin: That prince was chaced beyond the
Loire, and almo&s;t totally abandoned all the northern pro|vinces:
He was even pur&s;ued into the &s;outh by the united
arms of the Engli&s;h and Burgundians, and threatened
with total de&s;truction: Notwith&s;tanding the bravery and
fidelity of his captains, he &s;aw him&s;elf unequal to his
enemies in the open field; and found it nece&s;&s;ary to tem|porize,
and to avoid all hazardous actions with a rival,
who had gained &s;o much the a&s;cendant over him. And
to crown all the other pro&s;perities of Henry, his Queen
<PB N="122" REF="132">
was delivered of a &s;on, who was called by his father's
name, and who&s;e birth was celebrated by rejoicings no
le&s;s pompous and no le&s;s &s;incere at Parts than at London.
The infant prince &s;eemed to be univer&s;ally regarded as
the future heir of both monarchies.</P>
<P>BUT the glory of Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1422.</NOTE> when it had nearly reached
the &s;ummit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death</NOTE>, was &s;topped &s;hort by the hand of nature;
and all his mighty projects vani&s;hed into &s;moke. He
was &s;eized with a fi&s;tula, which the &s;urgeons at that time
had not &s;kill enough to cure; and he was at la&s;t &s;en&s;ible,
that his di&s;temper was mortal, and that his end was ap|proaching.
He &s;ent for his brother the duke of Bedford,
the earl of Warwic, and a few more noblemen, whom
he had honoured with his confidence; and he delivered
to them, in great tranquillity, his la&s;t will with regard to
the government of his kingdom and family. He entreated
them to continue; towards his infant &s;on, the &s;ame fidelity
and attachment, which they had always profe&s;&s;ed to him
during his lifetime, and which had been cemented by &s;o
many mutual good offices. He expre&s;&s;ed his indifference
on the approach of death; and tho' he regreted, that
he mu&s;t leave unfini&s;hed a work &s;o happily begun, he
declared him&s;elf confident, that the final acqui&s;ition of
France would be the effect of their prudence and valour.
He left the regency of that kingdom to his elde&s;t bro|ther,
the duke of Bedford; that of England to his
younger, the duke of Gloce&s;ter; and the care of his
&s;on's per&s;on to the earl of Warwic. He recommended
to all of them an anxious care to maintain the friend&s;hip
of the duke of Burgundy; and advi&s;ed them never to
give liberty to the French princes taken at Azincour, till
his &s;on was of age, and could him&s;elf hold the reins of
government. And he conjured them, if the &s;ucce&s;s of
their arms &s;hould not enable them to place young Henry
<PB N="123" REF="133">
on the throne of France, never at lea&s;t to make peace
with that kingdom, unle&s;s the enemy, by the ce&s;&s;ion of
Normandy, and its annexation to the crown of England,
made compen&s;ation for all the hazards and expence of
his enterprize<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trele$, chap. 26$. Hall, fol. 80.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HE next applied him&s;elf to his devotions, and ordered
his chaplain to read the &s;even penitential p&s;alms. When
he came to that pa&s;&s;age of the fifty-fir&s;t p&s;alm; <HI>Build
thou the walls of Jeru&s;alem;</HI> he interrupted him, and pro|fe&s;&s;ed his &s;erious intention, after he &s;hould have fully
&s;ubdued France, to have made a cru&s;ade again&s;t the in|fidels,
and recover po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Holy Land<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">St. Remi, chap. 118. Mon&s;treler, chap. 265.</NOTE>. So
ingenious are men in deceiving them&s;elves, that Henry
forgot in tho&s;e moments, all the blood &s;pilt by his ambi|tion;
and received comfort from this late and feeble re|&s;olve,
which, as the mode of the&s;e enterprizes was now
pa&s;t, he certainly would never have carried into execu|tion.
He expired in the thirty fourth year of his age and the tenth of his reign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">31 Augu&s;t.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many eminent virtues; and if
we give indulgence to ambition in a monarch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and charac|ter of the King.</NOTE> or
rank it, as the vulgar are inclined to do, among his vir|tues,
they were un&s;tained by any con&s;iderable blemi&s;h.
His abilities appeared, equally in the cabinet and in
the field; the boldne&s;s of his enterprizes was no le&s;s re|markable
than his per&s;onal valour in conducting them.
He had the talent of attaching his friends by affability,
and of gaining his enemies by addre&s;s and clemency.
The Engli&s;h, dazzled by the lu&s;tre of his character,
&s;till more than by that of his victories, were reconciled
to the defects of his title: The French almo&s;t forgot
that he was an enemy: And his care of maintaining ju&s;tice
in his civil admini&s;tration, and pre&s;erving di&s;cipline in
<PB N="124" REF="134">
his armies, made &s;ome amends to both nations for the
calamities in&s;eparable from tho&s;e wars, in which his &s;hort
reign was almo&s;t entirely occupied. That he could for|give
the earl of Marche, who had a better right to the
throne than him&s;elf, is a &s;ure proof of his magnanimity;
and that the earl relied &s;o entirely on his friend&s;hip is no
le&s;s a proof of his e&s;tabli&s;hed character for candour and
&s;incerity. There remain in hi&s;tory few in&s;tances of &s;uch
mutual tru&s;t; and &s;till fewer where neither party found
rea&s;on to repent it.</P>
<P>THE exterior figure of this great prince, as well as
his deportment, was engaging. His &s;tature was &s;ome|what
above the middle &s;ize; his countenance beautiful;
his limbs genteel and &s;lender, but full of vigour; and he
excelled in all warlike and manly exerci&s;es<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">T. Livii, p. 4.</NOTE>. He left
by his Queen, Catherine of France, only one &s;on, not
full nine months old; who&s;e misfortunes in the cour&s;e of
his life, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the glories and &s;ucce&s;&s;es of his fa|ther.</P>
<P>IN le&s;s than two months after Henry's death, Charles
VI. of France, his father-in-law, terminated his unhap|py
life. He had, for &s;everal years, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only the ap|pearance
of royal authority: Yet was this circum&s;tance
of con&s;iderable moment to the Engli&s;h; and divided the
duty and affections of the French between them and the
Dauphin. This prince was proclaimed and crowned
King of France at Poictiers, under the name of Charles
VII. Rheims, the place where that ceremony was
u&s;ually performed, was at that time in the hands of his
enemies.</P>
<P>CATHERINE OF France, Henry's widow, married
&s;oon after his death, a Welch gentleman, Sir Owen
Tudor, &s;aid to be de&s;cended from the antient princes of
<PB N="125" REF="135">
that country: She bore him two &s;ons, Edmund and
Ja&s;per, of whom, the elde&s;t was created earl of Rich|mond;
the &s;econd earl of Pembroke. The family of
Tudor, fir&s;t rai&s;ed to di&s;tinction by this alliance,
mounted afterwards the throne of England.</P>
<P>THE long &s;chi&s;m,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mi&s;cellane|ous tran&s;|actions.</NOTE> which had divided the Latin church
for near forty years, was finally terminated in this reign
by the council of Con&s;tancei which depo&s;ed the Pope,
John XXIII. for his crimes, and elected Martin V. in his
place, who was acknowledged by almo&s;t all the kingdoms
of Europe. This great and unu&s;ual act of authority in
the council gave the Roman Pontiffs ever after a mortal
antipathy to the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies. The &s;ame jealou&s;y,
which had long prevailed in mo&s;t European countries,
between the civil ari&s;tocracy and monarchy, now al&s;o
took place between the&s;e powers in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical
body. But the great &s;eparation of the bi&s;hops in the
&s;everal &s;tates, and the difficulty of a&s;&s;embling them, gave
the Pope a mighty advantage, and made it more ea&s;y for
him to collect all the power of the Hierarchy in his own
per&s;on. The cruelty and treachery which attended the
puni&s;hments of John Hu&s;s and Jerome of Prague, the
unhappy di&s;ciples of Wickliffe, who were burned alive
for their errors by this council, prove this melancholy
truth, that toleration is none of the virtues of prie&s;ts in
any form of eccle&s;ia&s;tical government. But as the Eng|li&s;h
prince had little or no concern in the&s;e great tran&s;|actions,
we are here the more conci&s;e in relating them.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ion of array, which we meet with,
was i&s;&s;ued in this reign<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. ix. p. 254, 255.</NOTE>. The military part of the feudal
&s;y&s;tem, which was the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential circum&s;tance of it,
was entirely di&s;&s;olved; and could no longer &s;erve for the
defence of the kingdom. Henry, therefore, when he
<PB N="126" REF="136">
went to France in 1415, empowered certain commi&s;&s;ion|ers
to take a review of all the freemen in each county
able to bear arms, to divide them into companies, and to
keep them in readiness for re&s;i&s;ting the enemy. This
was the aera, when the feudal militia gave place to one
which was perhaps &s;till le&s;s orderly and regular.</P>
<P>WE have an authentic and exact account of the ordi|nary
revenues of the crown during this reign; and they
amount only to 55,714 pounds 10 &s;hillings and 10 pence
a-year<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. x. p. 113.</NOTE>. This is nearly the &s;ame with the revenues of
Henry III. and the Kings of England had neither become
much richer nor poorer in the cour&s;e of &s;o many years.
The ordinary expences of the government amounted to
52,507 pounds 16 &s;hillings and 10 pence: So that the
King had of &s;urplus only 3206 pounds 14 &s;hillings for
the &s;upport of his hou&s;hold; for his wardrobe; for the
expence of emba&s;&s;ies; and other articles. This &s;um
was nowi&s;e &s;ufficient; he was therefore obliged to have
frequent recour&s;e to parliamentary &s;upplies, and was
thus, even in time of peace, not altogether independant
of his people. But wars were a mon&s;trous expence,
which neither the prince's ordinary revenue, nor the ex|traordinary
&s;upplies, were able to bear; and he was al|ways
reduced to many mi&s;erable &s;hifts, in order to make
any tolerable figure in them. He commonly borrowed
money from all quarters; he pawned his jewels, and
&s;ometimes the crown it&s;elf<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 190.</NOTE>; he ran in arrears to his
army; and he was often obliged, notwith&s;tanding all
the&s;e expedients, to &s;top in the mid&s;t of his career of
victory, and to grant truces to the enemy. The high
pay which was given to &s;oldiers agreed very ill with this
low revenue. All the extraordinary &s;upplies granted by
parliament to Henry during the cour&s;e of his reign were
<PB N="127" REF="137">
only &s;even tenths and fifteenths, about 203,000 pounds<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary Hi&s;tory, vol. ii. p. 168.</NOTE>.
It is ea&s;y to compute how &s;oon this money mu&s;t be ex|hau&s;ted
by armies of 24,000 archers, and 6000 hor&s;e;
when each archer had a &s;ixpence a-day<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">It appears from many pa&s;&s;ages of Rymer, particularly vol. ix. p. 258, that the King paid 20 marks a-year for an archer, which is a good deal above &s;ixpence a-day. The price had ri&s;en, as is natural, by rai&s;ing the denomination of money.</NOTE>, and each hor&s;e-|man
two &s;hillings. The mo&s;t &s;plendid &s;ucce&s;&s;es proved
commonly very fruitless, when &s;upported by &s;o poor a
revenue; and the debts and difficulties, which he there|by
incurred, made the King pay dear for his victories.
The civil admini&s;tration, likewi&s;e, even in time of peace,
could never be very regular, where the government was
&s;o ill enabled to &s;upport it&s;elf. Henry a year before his
death owed debts, which had been contracted when he
was prince of Wales<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. x. p. 114.</NOTE>. It was in vain that the parlia|ment
pretended to re&s;train him from arbitrary practices,
when he was reduced to &s;uch nece&s;&s;ities. Ttho' the right
of levying purveyance, for in&s;tance, had been ex|pre&s;ly
guarded again&s;t by the great charter it&s;elf,
and was frequently complained of by the commons, it
was found ab&s;olutely impracticable to aboli&s;h it; and the
parliament at length, &s;ubmitting to it as a legal preroga|tive,
contented them&s;elves with enacting laws to limit
and confine it. The duke of Gloce&s;ter, in the reign of
Richard II. po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a revenue of 60,000 crowns, (about
30,000 pounds a-year of our pre&s;ent money) as we learn
from Froi&s;&s;art<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Liv. iv. chap. 86.</NOTE>, and was con&s;equently richer than
the King him&s;elf, if all circum&s;tances be duly con&s;i|dered.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that the city of Calais alone was
an annual expence on the crown of 19,119 pounds<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. x. p. 11$.</NOTE>;
<PB N="128" REF="138">
that is, above a third of the common charge of the go|vernment
in time of peace. This fortre&s;s was of no u&s;e
to the defence of England, and only gave that kingdom
an inlet to annoy France. Ireland co&s;t two thou&s;and
pounds a-year, over and above its own revenue; which
was certainly very low. Every thing contributes to give
us a very mean idea of the &s;tate of Europe in tho&s;e ages.</P>
<P>FROM the mo&s;t early times, till the reign of Edward
III. the denomination of money had never been altered:
A pound fterling was &s;till a pound troy; that is, about
three pounds of our pre&s;ent money. That conqueror
was fir&s;t obliged to innovate in this important article. In
the twentieth year of his reign, he coined twenty-two
&s;hillings out of a pound troy; in his twenty-&s;eventh
year he coined twenty-five &s;hillings But Henry V. who
was al&s;o a conqueror, rai&s;ed &s;till farther the denomina|tion,
and coined thirty &s;hillings, from a pound troy<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Fleetwood's Chronicon Precio&s;um, p. 52.</NOTE>:
His revenue therefore would be about 110,000 pounds
of our pre&s;ent money; and by the cheapne&s;s of provi|&s;ions,
would be equivalent to above 330,000 pounds.</P>
<P>NONE of the princes of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter ven|tured
to impo&s;e taxes without con&s;ent of parliament:
Their doubtful or bad title became &s;o far of advantage to
the con&s;titution. The rule was then fixed, and could
not &s;afely be broke afterwards even by more ab&s;olute
princes.</P>

They declined altogether the name of <HI>Re|gent</HI>
<PB N="130" REF="140">
with regard to England: They appointed the duke
of Bedford to be <HI>protector</HI> or <HI>guardian</HI> of that kingdom,

council, without who&s;e advice and approbation no mea|&s;ure
of importance could be determined<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 564.</NOTE>. The per&s;on
and education of the infant prince was committed to
Henry Beaufort, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, his great uncle,
and the legitimated &s;on of John of Gaunt, duke of Lan|ca&s;ter;
who, as his family could never have any pre|ten&s;ions
to the crown, might &s;afely, they thought, be
intru&s;ted with that important charge<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 83. Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 27.</NOTE>. The two prin|ces,
the dukes of Bedford and Gloce&s;ter, who might

being per&s;ons of great integrity and honour, acquie&s;ced
willingly in any appointment, which &s;eemed to give &s;e|curity

to be the object of greate&s;t moment, they avoided every
di&s;pute, which might throw an ob&s;tacle in the way of
the&s;e conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>WHEN the &s;tate of affairs between the Engli&s;h and
French Kings was con&s;idered with a &s;uperficial eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE>
every advantage &s;eemed to be on the &s;ide of the former;
and the total expul&s;ion of Charles appeared to be an
event, which might naturally be expected from the &s;u|perior
power of his rival. Tho' Henry was yet in his
infancy, the admini&s;tration was devolved on the duke of
Bedford, the mo&s;t accomplished prince of his age; who&s;e
experience, prudence, valour, and genero&s;ity perfectly
qualified him for this high office, and enabled him both
<PB N="131" REF="141">
to maintain union among his friends, and to gain the
confidence of his enemies. The whole power of England
was at his command: He was at the head of armies
enured to victory: He was &s;econded by the mo&s;t renowned
generals of the age, the earls of Somer&s;et, Warwic,
Sali&s;bury, Suffolk, and Arundel, Sir John Talbot, and
Sir John Fa&s;tolfe: And be&s;ides Guienne, the antient
inheritance of England, he was ma&s;ter of the capital,
and of all the northern provinces, which were be&s;t
enabled to furni&s;h him with &s;upplies both of men and
money, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport his English forces.</P>
<P>BUT Charles, notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ent inferiority
of his power, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome advantages, derived partly
from his &s;ituation, partly from his per&s;onal character,
which promi&s;ed him &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;erved, fir&s;t to con|troul,
then to overbalance, the &s;uperior force and opu|lence
of his enemies. He was the true and undoubted
heir of the monarchy: Every Frenchman, who knew the
intere&s;ts, or de&s;ired the independance of his country,
turned his eyes towards him as its &s;ole refuge: The ex|clu&s;ion
given him, by the imbecillity of his father, and
the forced or precipitate con&s;ent of the &s;tates, had plainly
no validity: That &s;pirit of faction, which had blinded
the people, could not long hold them in &s;o gro&s;s a delu|&s;ion:
Their national and inveterate hatred again&s;t the
Engli&s;h, the authors of all their mi&s;eries, mu&s;t &s;oon re|vive,
and give them an indignation at bending their
necks under the yoke of that ho&s;tile people: Great
nobles and princes, accu&s;tomed to maintain an inde|pendance
again&s;t their native &s;overeigns, would never en|dure
a &s;ubjection to &s;trangers: And tho' mo&s;t of the prin|ces
of the blood were, &s;ince the fatal battle of Azincour,
detained pri&s;oners in England, the inhabitants of their
deme&s;nes, their friends, their va&s;&s;als, all declared a
<PB N="132" REF="142">
zealous attachment to the King, and exerted them&s;elves
in re&s;i&s;ting the violence of foreign invaders.</P>
<P>CHARLES him&s;elf, tho' only in his twentieth year,
was of a character well calculated to become the object
of the&s;e benevolent &s;entiments; and perhaps from the
favour, which naturally attends youth, was the more
likely, on account of his tender age, to acquire the
good-will of his native &s;ubjects. He was a prince of
the mo&s;t friendly and benign di&s;po&s;ition, of ea&s;y and fa|miliar
manners, and of a ju&s;t and &s;ound, tho' not a very
vigorous under&s;tanding. Sincere, generous, affable, he
engaged from affection the &s;ervices of his followers, even
while his low fortunes might make it their intere&s;t to de&s;ert
him; and the lenity of his temper could pardon in
them tho&s;e &s;ailles of di&s;content, to which princes in his
&s;ituation are &s;o frequently expo&s;ed. The love of plea|&s;ure
often &s;educed him into indolence; but amid&s;t all his
irregularities the goodne&s;s of his heart &s;till &s;hone forth;
and by exerting at intervals his courage and activity,
he proved, that his general remi&s;&s;ne&s;s proceeded not from
the want, either of a ju&s;t &s;pirit of ambition, or of per|&s;onal va$our.</P>
<P>THO' the virtues of this amiable prince lay &s;ome time
in ob&s;curity, the duke of Bedford knew, that his title
alone made him formidable, and that every foreign a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
would be requi&s;ite, ere an Engli&s;h regent could
hope to complete the conque&s;t of France; an enterprize,
which, however it might &s;eem to be much advanced,
was &s;till expo&s;ed to many and great difficulties. The
chief circum&s;tance, which had procured to the Engli&s;h
all their pre&s;ent advantages, was the re&s;entment of the
duke of Burgundy again&s;t Charles; and as that prince
&s;eemed intent rather in gratifying his pa&s;&s;ion than con|&s;ulting
his intere&s;ts, it was the more ea&s;y for the regent,
by demon&s;trations of re&s;pect and confidence, to retain
<PB N="133" REF="143">
him in the alliance of England. He bent therefore all
his endeavours to that purpo&s;e: He gave the duke every
proof of friend&s;hip and regard: He even proffered him
the regency of France, which Philip declined: And that
he might corroborate national connexions by private ties,
he concluded his own marriage with the prince&s;s of Bur|gundy,
which had been &s;tipulated by the treaty of Arras.</P>
<P>BEING &s;en&s;ible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1423.</NOTE> that next to the alliance of Burgundy,
the friend&s;hip of the duke of Brittany was of the greate&s;t
importance towards forwarding the Engli&s;h conque&s;ts;
and that, as the provinces of France, already &s;ubdued,
lay between the dominions of the&s;e two princes, he could
never hope for any &s;ecurity without pre&s;erving his con|nexions
with them; he was very intent on &s;trengthening
him&s;elf al&s;o from that quarter. The duke of Brittany,
having received many ju&s;t rea&s;ons of di&s;plea&s;ure from the
mini&s;ters of Charles, had already acceded to the treaty
of Troye, and had, with other va&s;&s;als of the crown,
done homage to Henry V. in quality of heir to the king|dom:
But as the regent knew, that the duke was much
governed by his brother, the count de Richemont, he
endeavoured to fix his friendship, by paying his court
and doing &s;ervices to this haughty and ambitious prince.</P>
<P>ARTHUR, count de Richemont, had been taken pri|&s;oner
at the battle of Azincour, had been treated with
great indulgence by the late King, and had even been
permitted on his parole to take a journey into Brittany,
where the &s;tate of affairs required his pre&s;ence.
The death of that victorious monarch happened before Riche|mont's
return; and this prince pretended, that, as his
word was given per&s;onally to Henry V. he was not
bound to fulfil it towards his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or:<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th April.</NOTE> A

was &s;ettled at Amiens between the dukes of Bedford,
Burgundy, and Brittany, at which the count de Riche|mont
was al&s;o pre&s;ent<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 84. Mon&s;trelet, vol. i. p. 4. Stowe, p. 364.</NOTE>: The alliance was renewed
between the&s;e princes: And the regent per&s;uaded Philip
to give in marriage to Richemont his elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter, widow
of the decea&s;ed Dauphin, Lewis, the elder brother of
Charles. Thus Arthur was connected both with the
regent and the duke of Burgundy, and &s;eemed en|gaged
by intere&s;t to pro&s;ecute the &s;ame object, in for|warding
the progre&s;s of the Engli&s;h arms.</P>
<P>WHILE the vigilance of the duke of Bedford was em|ployed
in gaining or confirming the&s;e allies, who&s;e neigh|bourhood
rendered them &s;o important, he did not over|look
the &s;tate of more remote countries. The duke of
Albany, regent of Scotland, had died; and his power
had devolved to Murdac, his &s;on, a prince of a weak
under&s;tanding and of indolent di&s;po&s;itions; who, far
from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the talents requi&s;ite for the government of
that fierce people, was not even able to maintain autho|rity
in his own family, or re&s;train the petulance and in|&s;olence
of his &s;ons. The ardour of the Scots to &s;erve in
France, where Charles treated them with great honour
and di&s;tiction, and where the regent's brother enjoyed
the dignity of con&s;table, broke out afre&s;h under this
feeble admini&s;tration: New &s;uccours daily came over,
and filled the armies of the French King: The earl of
Douglas conducted a reinforcement of 5000 men to his
a&s;&s;i&s;tance. And it was ju&s;tly to be dreaded, that the
Scots, by commencing open ho&s;tilities in the north,
would occa&s;ion a diver&s;ion &s;till more con&s;iderable of the
Engli&s;h power, and would ea&s;e Charles, in part, of that
load, by which he was at pre&s;ent &s;o grievou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed.
<PB N="135" REF="147">
The duke of Bedford, therefore, per&s;uaded the Engli&s;h
council to form an alliance with James their pri&s;oner; to
free that prince from his long captivity; and to con|nect
him with England, by marrying him to a daugh|ter
of the Earl of Somer&s;et and cou&s;in of the young
King<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 86. Stowe, p. 364. Grafton, p. 501.</NOTE>. As the Scots regent, tired of his pre&s;ent dig|nity,
which he was not able to &s;upport, was now be|come
entirely &s;incere in his applications for James's liberty,
the treaty was &s;oon concluded; forty thou&s;and pounds
of ran&s;om were &s;tipulated<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. x. p. 299, 300. 326.</NOTE>; and the King of Scots was
re&s;tored to the throne of his ance&s;tors, and proved, in his
&s;hort reign, one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious princes, who had
ever governed that kingdom. He was murdered in 1437
by his traiterous kin&s;man the earl of Athole. His affec|tions
inclined him to the party of France; but the Eng|li&s;h
had never rea&s;on, during his life-time, to complain
of any breach of the neutrality by Scotland.</P>
<P>BUT the regent was not &s;o employed in the&s;e political
negotiations as to neglect the operations of war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Military operations.</NOTE> from
which alone he could hope to &s;ucceed in expelling the
French monarch. Tho' the chief &s;eat of Charles's power
lay in the &s;outhern provinces, on the other &s;ide of the
Loire; his partizans were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome fortre&s;&s;es in the
northern, and even in the neighbourhood of Paris; and
it behoved the duke of Bedford fir&s;t to clear the&s;e coun|tries
of the enemy, before he could think of attempting
more di&s;tant conque&s;ts. The ca&s;tle of Dor&s;oy was taken af|ter
a &s;iege of &s;ix weeks: That of Noyelle and the town of
R&uuml;e in Picardy underwent the &s;ame fate: Pont &s;ur Seine,
Vertus, Montaigu were &s;ubjected by the Engli&s;h arms:
And a more con&s;iderable advantage was &s;oon after gained
<PB N="136" REF="148">
by the united forces of England and Burgundy. John
Stuart, con&s;table of Scotland, and the lord d'E&s;ti&s;&s;ac had
formed the &s;iege of Crevant in Burgundy: The earls of
Sali&s;bury and Suffolk, with the count de Toulongeon,
were &s;ent to its relief: A fierce and well di&s;puted action
en&s;ued; The Scots and French were defeated: The con&s;table of Scotland and the count de Ventadour were
taken pri&s;oners: And above a thou&s;and men, among
whom was Sir William Hamilton, were left on the field
of battle<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 85. Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 8. Holing&s;hed, p. 586. Grafton, p. 500.</NOTE>. The taking of Gaillon upon the Seine, and
of la Charit&eacute; upon the Loire was the fruit of this vic|tory:
And as this latter place opened an entrance into
the &s;outhern provinces, the acqui&s;ition of it appeared on
that account of the greater importance to the duke of
Bedford, and &s;eemed to promi&s;e a &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue to the
war.</P>
<P>THE more King Charles was threatened with an in|va&s;ion
in tho&s;e provinces which adhered to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1424.</NOTE> the
more nece&s;&s;ary it became, that he &s;hould retain po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of every fortre&s;s, which he &s;till held within the
quarters of the enemy. The duke of Bedford had be|&s;ieged
in per&s;on, during the &s;pace of three months, the
town of Yvri in Normandy; and the brave governor,
unable to make any longer defence, was obliged to ca|pitulate;
and he agreed to &s;urrender the town, if, before
a certain term, no relief arrived to him. Charles, in|formed
of the&s;e conditions, determined to make an at|tempt
for &s;aving the place. He collected, with &s;ome
difficulty, an army of 14,000 men, of whom the half
were Scots; and he &s;ent them thither under the com|mand
of the earl of Buchan, the con&s;table of France;
who was attended by the earl of Douglas, his country|man,
<PB N="137" REF="149">
the duke of Alen&ccedil;on, the mare&s;chal de la Fayette,
the count d'Aumale, and the vi&s;count de Narbonne.
When the con&s;table arrived within a few leagues of
Yvri, he found that he was come too late, and that the
place was already &s;urrendered. He immediately turned
to the left, and &s;at down before Verne&uuml;il, which the
inhabitants, in &s;pite of the garri&s;on, delivered up to him<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 14. Grafton, p. 504.</NOTE>.
Buchan might now have returned in &s;afety, and with the
glory of making an acqui&s;ition no le&s;s important than the
place, which he was &s;ent to relieve: But hearing of
Bedford's approach, he called a council of war; and
a&s;ked their opinions with regard to the conduct which he
&s;hould follow in this emergence. The wi&s;er part of the
council declared for a retreat; and repre&s;ented, that all
the pa&s;t misfortunes of the French had proceeded from
their ra&s;hne&s;s in giving battle, when no nece&s;&s;ity obliged
them to ri&s;que a deci&s;ive action; that this army was the
la&s;t re&s;ource of the King, and the only defence of the
few provinces which remained to him; and that every
rea&s;on invited him to embrace cautious councils, which
left time for his &s;ubjects to return to their &s;en&s;e of duty,
and gave lei&s;ure for di&s;cord to ari&s;e among his enemies,
who, being united by no common band of interest or mo|tive
of alliance, could not long per&s;evere in their animo|&s;ity
again&s;t him. All the&s;e prudential con&s;iderations
were overborne by a vain point of honour, not to turn
their backs to the enemy; and they re&s;olved to await
the arrival of the duke of Bedford.</P>
<P>THE numbers were nearly equal in this rencounter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">27th of Augu&s;t. Battle of Vern&uuml;il.</NOTE> and as the long continuance of the war had introduced
di&s;cipline, which, however imperfect, &s;ufficed to main|tain
&s;ome appearance of order in &s;uch &s;mall armies, the
battle was fierce, and well di&s;puted, and attended with
<PB N="138" REF="150">
blood&s;hed on both &s;ides. The con&s;table drew up his
forces under the walls of Verne&uuml;il, and re&s;olved to abide
the attack of the enemy: But the impatience of the vi&s;|count
of Narbonne, who broke his ranks, and obliged
the whole line to follow him in &s;ome hurry and confu&s;ion,
was the cau&s;e of the misfortune, which en&s;ued. The
Engli&s;h archers, fixing their pali$adoes before them, ac|cording
to their u&s;ual cu&s;tom, &s;ent a volley of arrows
into the thicke&s;t of the French army; and tho' beat
from their ground, and obliged to take &s;helter among the
baggage, they &s;oon rallied, and continued to commit
great &s;laughter upon the enemy. The duke of Bedford,
mean-while, at the head of the men at arms, made im|pre&s;&s;ion
on the French, broke their ranks, cha&s;ed them
off the field, and rendered the victory entirely compleat
and deci&s;ive<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 88, 89, 90. Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 15. Stowe, p. 365. Holling&s;hed, p. 588.</NOTE>. The con&s;table him&s;elf peri&s;hed in
battle, the earl of Douglas and his &s;on, the counts of
Aumale, Tonnerre and Ventadour, with many other
con&s;iderable nobility. The duke of Alen&ccedil;on, the ma|re&s;chal
de la Fayette, the lords of Gaucour and Morte|mar
were taken pri&s;oners. There fell about four thou|&s;and
of the French; and &s;ixteen hundred of the Engli&s;h;
a lo&s;s then e&s;teemed &s;o unu&s;ual on the &s;ide of the victors,
that the duke of Bedford prohibited all rejoicings for his

<P>THE condition of the King of France appeared now
very terrible, and almo&s;t de&s;perate. He had lo&s;t the
flower of his army and the brave&s;t of his nobles in this
fatal action: He had no re&s;ources for recruiting or &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting his troops: He wanted money even for his per&s;onal
&s;ub&s;i&s;tance; and tho' all parade of a court was bani&s;hed,
it was with difficulty he could keep a table, &s;upplied with
<PB N="139" REF="151">
the plaine&s;t nece&s;&s;aries, for him&s;elf and his few followers:
Every day brought him intelligence of &s;ome lo&s;s or mi&s;|fortune: Towns, which were bravely defended, were
obliged at la&s;t to &s;urrender for want of relief or &s;upply:
He &s;aw his partizans entirely chaced from all the provin|ces
which lay north of the Loire: And he expected &s;oon
to lo&s;e, by the united efforts of his enemies, all the ter|ritories,
of which he had hitherto continued ma&s;ter;
when an accident happened, which &s;aved him on the
brink of ruin, and lo&s;t the Engli&s;h &s;uch an opportunity
for compleating their conque&s;ts, as they never afterwards
were able to recall.</P>
<P>JAQUELINE, counte&s;s of Hainault and Holland, and
heir of the&s;e provinces, had e&s;pou&s;ed John duke of Bra|bant,
cou&s;in german to the duke of Burgundy; but
having unhappily made this choice, from the u&s;ual mo|tives
of princes, &s;he &s;oon found rea&s;on to repent her of
the unequal alliance. She was a prince&s;s of a ma&s;culine
&s;pirit and uncommon under&s;tanding; the duke of Bra|bant
was of a &s;ickly complexion and weak mind: She
was in the vigour of her age; he had only reached his
fifteenth year: the&s;e cau&s;es had in&s;pired her with &s;uch
contempt of her hu&s;band, which &s;oon proceeded to anti|pathy,
that &s;he determined to break a marriage, where,
it is probable, nothing but the ceremony had as yet in|tervened.
The court of Rome was commonly very open
to applications of this nature, when &s;econded by power
and money; but as the prince&s;s fore&s;aw great oppo&s;i|tion
from her hu&s;band's relations, and was impatient to
effect her purpo&s;e, &s;he made her e&s;cape into England,
and threw her&s;elf under the protection of the duke of
Gloce&s;ter. That prince, with many noble qualities, had
the defect of being governed by an impetuous temper
and vehement pa&s;&s;ions; and he was ra&s;hly induced, as
well by the charms of the counte&s;s her&s;elf, as by the
<PB N="140" REF="152">
pro&s;pect of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing her rich inheritance, to offer him|&s;elf
to her as a hu&s;band. Without waiting for a papal
di&s;pen&s;ation; without endeavouring to reconcile the duke
of Burgundy to this mea&s;ure; he entered into a con|tract
of marriage with Jaqueline, and immediately at|tempted
to put him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her dominions.
Philip was di&s;gu&s;ted with &s;o precipitant a conduct: He
re&s;ented the injury done to the duke of Brabant his near
relation: He dreaded to have the Engli&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hed on
all &s;ides of him: And he fore&s;aw the con&s;equences, which
mu&s;t attend the exten&s;ive and uncontrouled dominion of
that nation, if, before the full &s;ettlement of their power,
they in&s;ulted and injured an ally, to whom they had al|ready
been &s;o much indebted, and who was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary
for &s;upporting them in their farther progre&s;s. He en|couraged,
therefore, the duke of Brabant to make re|&s;i&s;tance:
He engaged many of Jaqueline's &s;ubjects to
adhere to that prince: He him&s;elf marched troops to his
&s;upport: And as the duke of Gloce&s;ter &s;till per&s;evered
in his purpo&s;e, a &s;harp war was &s;uddenly kindled in the
Low Countries. The quarrel &s;oon became per&s;onal as
well as political. The Engli&s;h prince wrote to the duke
of Burgundy, complaining of the oppo&s;ition made to his
preten&s;ions; and tho' in the main, he employed amicable
terms in his letter, he took notice of &s;ome fal&s;hoods, into
which, he &s;aid, Philip had been betrayed during the
cour&s;e of the&s;e tran&s;actions. This unguarded expre&s;&s;ion
was highly re&s;ented: The duke of Burgundy in&s;i&s;ted,
that he &s;hould retract it: And mutual challenges and de|fiances
pa&s;&s;ed between them on this occa&s;ion<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii, p. 19, 20, 21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Bedford could ea&s;ily fore&s;ee the bad
effects of &s;o ill-timed and imprudent a quarrel. All the
&s;uccours, which he expected from England, and which
were &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in this critical emergence, were inter|cepted
<PB N="141" REF="153">
by his brother, and employed in Holland and
Hainault: The forces of the duke of Burgundy, which
he al&s;o depended on, were diverted by the &s;ame wars:
And be&s;ides this double lo&s;s, he was in imminent danger
of alienating for ever that confederate, who&s;e friend&s;hip
was of the utmo&s;t importance to his intere&s;ts, and whom
the late King had injoined him, with his dying breath,
to gratify by every mark of regard and attachment. He
inforced all the&s;e topics to the duke of Gloce&s;ter: He en|deavoured
to mitigate the re&s;entment of the duke of Bur|gundy:
He interpo&s;ed with his good offices between
the&s;e princes: But he was not &s;ucce&s;sful in any of his
endeavours; and he found, that the impetuo&s;ity of his
brother's temper was &s;till the chief ob&s;tacle to all ac|commodation<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, p. 18.</NOTE>. For this rea&s;on, in&s;tead of pu&s;hing the
victory gained at Verne&uuml;il, he found him&s;elf obliged to
take a journey into England, and to try, by his coun|cils
and authority, to moderate the mea&s;ures of the duke
of Gloce&s;ter.</P>
<P>THERE had likewi&s;e broke out &s;ome differences among
the Engli&s;h mini&s;try, which had proceeded to great ex|tremities,
and which required the regent's pre&s;ence to
compo&s;e them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 368. Holling&s;hed, p. 590.</NOTE>. The bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, to whom
the care of the King's per&s;on and education had been
entru&s;ted, was a prelate of great capacity and experi|ence,
but of an intriguing and dangerous character; and
as he a&s;pired to the government of affairs, he had conti|nual
di&s;putes with his nephew the protector, and he
gained frequent advantages over the vehement and impo|litic
temper of that prince.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1425.</NOTE> The duke of Bedford em|ployed
the authority of parliament to reconcile them;
and the&s;e rivals were obliged to promi&s;e before that a&s;|&s;embly,
<PB N="142" REF="154">
that they would bury all quarrels in oblivion<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 98, 99. Holling&s;hed, p. 593, 594. Polydore Virgil, p. 466. Grafton, p. 512, 519.</NOTE>.
Time al&s;o &s;eemed to open expedients for compo&s;ing the
difference with the duke of Burgundy. The credit of
that prince had procured a bull from the Pope; by which
not only Jaqueline's contract with the duke of Gloce&s;ter
was annulled; but it was al&s;o declared, that even in ca&s;e
of the duke of Brabant's death, it &s;hould never be law|ful
for her to e&s;pou&s;e the Engli&s;h prince. Humphrey,
de&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s, married another lady of inferior
rank, who had lived &s;ome time with him, as his mi&s;tre&s;s<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 367.</NOTE>.
The duke of Brabant died; and his widow, before &s;he
could recover po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her dominions, was obliged
to declare the duke of Burgundy her heir, in ca&s;e &s;he
died without children, and to promi&s;e never to marry
any per&s;on without his con&s;ent. But tho' the affair was
thus terminated to the advantage of Philip, it left a di&s;|agreeable
impre&s;&s;ion on his mind: It excited an extreme
jealou&s;y of the Engli&s;h, and opened his eyes to his true
intere&s;ts: And as nothing but his animo&s;ity again&s;t
Charles had engaged him in alliance with them, it coun|terbalanced
that pa&s;&s;ion by another of the &s;ame kind,
which in the end became prevalent, and brought him
back, by degrees, to his natural connexions with his fa|mily
and his native country.</P>
<P>ABOUT the &s;ame time, the duke of Brittany began to
withdraw him&s;elf from the Engli&s;h alliance. His bro|ther,
the count de Richemont, tho' connected by mar|riage
with the dukes of Burgundy and Bedford, was ex|tremely
attached by inclination to the French intere&s;t;
and he willingly hearkened to all the advances which
Charles made him for obtaining his friend&s;hip. The
high office of con&s;table, vacant by the earl of Buchan's
<PB N="143" REF="155">
death, was offered him; and as his martial and ambitious
temper a&s;pired to the command of armies, which he
had in vain attempted to obtain from the duke of Bedford,
he not only accepted that tru&s;t, but brought over his
brother to an alliance with the French monarch. The
new con&s;table, having made this one change in his
mea&s;ures, firmly adhered ever after to his engagements
with France. Tho' his pride and violence, which would
admit of no rival in his ma&s;ter's confidence, and even
prompted him to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the other favourites, had &s;o
much di&s;gu&s;ted Charles, that he once bani&s;hed him the
court, and refu&s;ed to admit him to his pre&s;ence, he &s;till
acted with vigour for the &s;ervice of that monarch, and
obtained at la&s;t, by his per&s;everance, the pardon of all
his pa&s;t offences.</P>
<P>IN this &s;ituation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1426.</NOTE> the duke of Bedford, on his return,
found the affairs of France, after pa&s;&s;ing eight months
in England. The duke of Burgundy was much di&s;gu&s;ted.
The duke of Brittany had entered into engagements
with Charles, and had done homage to that prince for
his dutchy. The French had been allowed to recover
from the a&s;toni&s;hment, into which their frequent di&s;a&s;ters
had thrown them. An incident even happened, which
&s;erved extremely to rai&s;e their courage. The earl of
Warwic had be&s;ieged Montargis with a &s;mall army of 3000
men, and the place was reduced to extremity, when the
ba&s;tard of Orleans undertook to throw relief into it.
This general, who was natural &s;on to the prince a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inated
by the duke of Burgundy, and who was after|wards
created count de Dunois, conducted a body of
1600 men to Montargis; and made an attack on the
enemy's trenches with &s;o much valour, prudence, and
good fortune, that he not only penetrated into the place,
but gave a &s;evere blow to the Engli&s;h, and obliged
<PB N="144" REF="156">
Warwic to rai&s;e the &s;iege<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 32, 33. Holling&s;hed, p. 597.</NOTE>. This was the fir&s;t &s;ignal
action, which rai&s;ed the &s;ame of Dunois, and opened
him the road to all tho&s;e great honours, which he after|wards
attained.</P>
<P>BUT the regent, &s;oon after his arrival, revived the
credit of the Engli&s;h arms, by an important enterprize,
which he happily atchieved. He &s;ecretly brought to|gether,
in &s;eparate detachments, a con&s;iderable army to the
frontiers of Brittany; and fell &s;o unexpectedly upon that
province, that the duke, unable to make re&s;i&s;tance,
yielded to all the terms required of him: He renounced
the French alliance; he engaged to maintain the treaty
of Troye; he acknowledged the duke of Bedford for
regent of France; and promi&s;ed to do homage for his
dutchy to King Henry<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 35, 36.</NOTE>. And the Engli&s;h prince, hav|ing
thus freed him&s;elf from a dangerous enemy who lay
behind him, re&s;olved on an undertaking, which, if &s;uc|ce&s;sful,
would, he hoped, ca&s;t the balance between the
two nations, and prepare the way for the final conque&s;t
of France.</P>
<P>THE city of Orleans was &s;o &s;ituated between the pro|vinces
commanded by Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1428.</NOTE><NOTE PLACE="marg">Siege of Orleans.</NOTE> and tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by
Charles, that it opened an ea&s;y entrance to either; and
as the duke of Bedford intended to make a great effort
to penetrate into the &s;outh of France, it behoved him to
begin with this place, which, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tan|ces,
was become the mo&s;t important in the kingdom. He
committed the conduct of the enterprize to the earl of
Sali&s;bury, who had newly brought him over a reinforce|ment
of 6000 men from England, and who had much
di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, by his abilities, during the cour&s;e
of the pre&s;ent wars. Sali&s;bury, pa&s;&s;ing the Loire, made
<PB N="145" REF="157">
him&s;elf ma&s;ter of &s;everal &s;mall places, which &s;urrounded
Orleans on that &s;ide<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 38, 39. Polyd. Virg. p. 468.</NOTE>; and as his intentions were there|by
known, the French King u&s;ed every expedient to &s;up|ply
the city with a garri&s;on and provi&s;ions, and enable
it to maintain a long and ob&s;tinate &s;iege. The lord of
Gaucour, a brave and experienced captain, was appointed
governor: Many officers of di&s;tinction threw them&s;elves
into the place: The troops, which they conducted, were
enured to war, and were determined to make the mo&s;t
ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance: And even the inhabitants, disciplined
by the long continuance of ho&s;tilities, were well quali|fied,
in their own defence, to &s;econd the efforts of the
mo&s;t veteran forces. The eyes of all Europe were turned
towards this &s;cene; where, it was rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed,
the French were to make their la&s;t &s;tand for maintaining
the independance of their monarchy, and the rights of
their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THE earl of Salisbury at la&s;t approached the place
with an army, which con&s;i&s;ted only of 10,000 men;
and not being able, with &s;o &s;mall a force, to inve&s;t &s;o
great a city, that commanded a bridge over the Loire,
he &s;tationed him&s;elf on the &s;outhern &s;ide towards So|logne,
leaving the other, towards the Beau&s;&s;e, &s;till open
to the enemy. He there attacked the fortifications,
which guarded the entry to the bridge; and after an
ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, he carried &s;everal of them: But was
him&s;elf killed by a cannon ball as he was taking a view
of the enemy<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 105. Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 39. Stowe, p. 369&punc; Holling&s;hed, p. 599. Grafton, p. 531.</NOTE>. The earl of Suffolk &s;ucceeded to the
command; and being re-inforced with great numbers of Engli&s;h
and Burgundians, he pa&s;&s;ed the river with the
main body of his army, and inve&s;ted Orleans on the
other &s;ide. As it was now the depth of winter, Suffolk,
<PB N="146" REF="158">
who found it difficult, in that &s;ea&s;on, to throw up in|trenchments
all around, contented him&s;elf, for the pre|&s;ent,
with erecting redoubts at different di&s;tances, where
his men were lodged in &s;afety, and were ready to inter|cept
the &s;upplies, which the enemy might attempt to
throw into the place. Tho' he had &s;everal pieces of
artillery in his camp, (and this is the fir&s;t &s;iege in Europe,
where cannon were found to be of importance) the art of
engineering was hitherto &s;o imperfect, that Suffolk tru&s;ted
more to famine than force for &s;ubduing the city; and he
propo&s;ed in the &s;pring to render the circumvallation more
compleat, by drawing intrenchments from one redoubt to
another. Numberle&s;s &s;eats of valour were performed
both by the be&s;iegers and be&s;ieged during this winter:
Bold &s;allies were made, and repul&s;ed with equal bold|ne&s;s:
Convoys were &s;ometimes introduced and often
intercepted: The &s;upplies were &s;till unequal to the con|&s;umption
of the place: And the English &s;eemed daily,
tho' &s;lowly, to be advancing towards the completion of their enterprize.</P>
<P>BUT while they lay in this &s;ituation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1429.</NOTE> the French
parties ravaged all the country around; and the be&s;ieg|ers,
who were obliged to draw their provi&s;ions from a
di&s;tance, were them&s;elves expo&s;ed to the danger of
want and famine. Sir John Fa&s;tolffe was bringing up a
large convoy, of every kind of &s;tores, which he e&s;corted
with a detachment of 2,500 men; when he was at|tacked
by a body of 4000 French, under the command
of the counts of Clermont and Dunois. Fa&s;tolffe drew
up behind his waggons; but the French generals, cau|tious
of attacking him in that po&s;ture, planted a battery
of cannon again&s;t him, which threw every thing into
confu&s;ion, and would have en&s;ured them the victory;
had not the impatience of &s;ome Scots troops, who
<PB N="147" REF="159">
broke the line of battle, brought on an engagement, in
which Fa&s;tolffe was victorious. The count de Dunois
was wounded; and above 500 French were left on the
field of battle. This action, which was of great im|portance
in the pre&s;ent conjuncture, was commonly call|ed
the battle of <HI>Herrings;</HI> becau&s;e the convoy brought
a great quantity of that kind of provi&s;ions, for the u&s;e
of the Engli&s;h army during the Lent &s;ea&s;on<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 106. Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 41, 42. Stowe, p. 369&punc; Holling&s;hed, p. 600. Polyd. Virg. p. 469. Grafton, p. 532.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CHARLES &s;eemed now to have but one expedient for
&s;aving this city, which had been &s;o long inve&s;ted. The
duke of Orleans, who was &s;till pri&s;oner in England,
prevailed on the protector and the council to con&s;ent,
that all his deme&s;nes &s;hould be allowed to pre&s;erve a neu|trality
during the war, and &s;hould be &s;eque&s;tered, for
greater &s;ecurity, into the hands of the duke of Burgundy.
This prince, who was much le&s;s cordial in the Engli&s;h
interests than formerly, went to Paris, and made the pro|po&s;al
to the duke of Bedford; but the regent replied
very coldly, that he was not of a humour to beat the
bu&s;hes, while others ran away with the game: An an|&s;wer,
which &s;o much di&s;gu&s;ted the duke, that he recalled
all the troops of Burgundy, that acted in the &s;iege<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 106. Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 42. Stowe, p. 369. Grafton, p. 533.</NOTE>.
The place, however, was every day more and more clo&s;ely
inve&s;ted by the Engli&s;h: Great &s;carcity began already to
be felt by the garri&s;on and inhabitants: Charles, in
de&s;pair of collecting an army, which &s;hould dare to ap|proach
the enemy's entrenchments, not only gave the city
for lo&s;t, but began to entertain a very di&s;mal pro&s;pect
with regard to the general &s;tate of his affairs. He &s;aw
that the country, in which he had hitherto, with great
difficulty, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, would be laid entirely open to the
<PB N="148" REF="160">
inva&s;ion of a powerful and victorious enemy; and he
talked already of retiring with the remains of his forces
into Languedoc and Dauphiny, and of defending him&s;elf
as long as po&s;&s;ible in tho&s;e di&s;tant provinces. But it
was fortunate for this good prince, that he lay under the
dominion of women; and that the women, whom he
con&s;ulted, had the &s;pirit to &s;upport his &s;inking re&s;olutions
in this de&s;perate extremity. Mary of Anjou, his Queen,
a prince&s;s of great merit and prudence, vehemently op|po&s;ed
this mea&s;ure, which, &s;he fore&s;aw, would di&s;cou|rage
all his partizans, and &s;erve as a general &s;ignal for
de&s;erting a prince, who &s;eemed him&s;elf to de&s;pair of &s;uc|ce&s;s.
His mi&s;tre&s;s too, the fair Agnes Sorel, who lived
in entire amity with the Queen, &s;econded all her remon|&s;trances,
and threatened, that, if he thus pu&s;illanimou&s;$y
threw away the &s;cepter of France, &s;he would &s;eek in the
court of England a fortune more corre&s;pondent to her wi&s;hes.
Love was able to rouze in the brea&s;t of Charles
that courage, which ambition had failed to excite: He
re&s;olved to di&s;pute every inch of ground with ant imperi|ous
enemy; and rather to peri&s;h with honour in the
mid&s;t of his friends than yield ingloriou&s;ly to his bad for|tune:
When relief was unexpectedly brought him by
another female of a very different character, who gave
ri&s;e to one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular revolutions, that is to be
met with in hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>IN the village of Domremi near Vaucouleurs, on the
borders of Lorraine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The maid of Orleans.</NOTE> there lived a country girl of twenty|&s;even
years of age, called Joan d'Arc, who was &s;ervant
in a &s;mall inn, and who in that &s;tation had been ac|cu&s;tomed
to tend the hor&s;es of the gue&s;ts, to ride them
without a $addle to the watering-place, and to perform
other offices, which, in well-frequented inns, commonly
fall to the &s;hare of the men &s;ervants<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 107. Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 42. Grafton, p. 534.</NOTE>. This girl was of
<PB N="149" REF="161">
an irreproachable life, and had not hitherto been remark|ed
for any &s;ingularity; whether that &s;he had met with
no occa&s;ion to excite her genius, or that the un&s;kilful
eyes of tho&s;e, who conver&s;ed with her, had not been
able to di&s;cern her uncommon merit. It is ea&s;y to ima|gine,
that the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of France was an in|tere&s;ting
object even to per&s;ons of the lowe&s;t rank, and
would become the frequent &s;ubject of their conver&s;ation:
A young prince, expelled his native throne, by the &s;e|dition
of &s;ubjects and by the arms of &s;trangers, could
not fail to move the compa&s;&s;ion of all his people, who&s;e
hearts were uncorrupted by faction; and the peculiar
character of Charles, &s;o &s;trongly inclined to friend&s;hip
and the tender pa&s;&s;ions, naturally rendered him the hero
of that &s;ex, who&s;e generous minds know no bounds in
their affections. The &s;iege of Orleans, the progre&s;s of
the Engli&s;h before that place, the great di&s;tre&s;s of the
garri&s;on and inhabitants, the importance of &s;aving this
city and its brave defenders, had turned thither the eyes
of all the world; and Joan, inflamed by the general
&s;entiment, was &s;eized with a wild de&s;ire of bringing relief
to her &s;overeign in his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Her unexperi|enced
mind, working day and night on this favourite
object, mi&s;took the impul&s;es of her pa&s;&s;ion for heavenly
in&s;pirations; and &s;he fancied, that &s;he &s;aw vi&s;ions, and
heard voices, exhorting her to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the throne of
France, and to expel the foreign invaders. An uncom|mon
intrepidity of temper made her overlook all the
dangers, which might attend her in &s;uch a path; and
thinking her&s;elf de&s;tined by heaven to this office, &s;he
threw a&s;ide that ba&s;hfulne&s;s and timidity, which would
naturally adhere to her &s;ex, her years, and her low &s;&s;ta|tion.
She went to Vaucouleurs; procured admi&s;&s;ion to
Baudricourt, the governor; informed him of her in&s;pira|tions
and intentions; and conjured him not to neglect
<PB N="150" REF="162">
the voice of God, who &s;poke thro' her, but to &s;econd
tho&s;e heavenly revelations, which impelled her to this
glorious enterprize. Baudricourt treated her at fir&s;t with
&s;ome neglect; but on her frequent returns to him, and
importunate &s;olicitations, he began to remark &s;omething
extraordinary in the maid, and was inclined, at all ha|zards,
to make &s;o ea&s;y an experiment. It is uncertain,
whether this gentleman had di&s;cernment enough to per|ceive,
that great u&s;e might be made with the vulgar
of &s;o uncommon an engine; or, what is more likely
in that credulous age, was him&s;elf a convert to this
vi&s;ionary: But he adopted at la&s;t the &s;cheme of Joan;
and he gave her &s;ome attendants, who conducted her
to the French court, which at that time re&s;ided at
Chinon.</P>
<P>IT is the bu&s;ine&s;s of hi&s;tory to di&s;tingui&s;h between the
<HI>mira$ulous</HI> and the <HI>marvellous;</HI> to reject the fir&s;t in all
narrations merely profane and human; to &s;cruple the
&s;econd; and when obliged by undoubted te&s;timony, as
in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, to admit of &s;omething extraordinary,
to receive as little of it as is con&s;i&s;tent with the known
facts and circum&s;tances. It is pretended, that Joan, im|mediately
on her admi&s;&s;ion, knew the King, tho' &s;he
had never &s;een his face before, and tho' he purpo&s;ely
kept him&s;elf in the crowd of courtiers, and had laid
a&s;ide every thing in his dre&s;s and apparel, which might
di&s;tingui&s;h him: That &s;he offered him, in the name of
the &s;upreme Creator, to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Orleans, and
conduct him to Rheims to be there crowned and anoint|ed;
and on his expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome doubts of her mi&s;&s;ion,
revealed to him, before &s;ome &s;worn confidents, a &s;ecret,
which was unknown to all the world but him&s;elf, and
which nothing but a heavenly in&s;piration could di&s;cover
to her: And that &s;he demanded, as the in&s;trument of
her future victories, a particular &s;word, which was kept
<PB N="151" REF="163">
in the church of St. Catharine de Fierbois, and which,
tho' &s;he had never &s;een it, &s;he de&s;cribed by all its marks,
and by the place in which it had long been laid and ne|glected<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 107. Holling&s;hed, p. 600.</NOTE>. This is certain, that all the&s;e miraculous
&s;tories were &s;pread abroad, in order to catch the vulgar.
The more the King and his mini&s;ters were determined
to give into the illu&s;ion, the more &s;cruples they pre|tended.
An a&s;&s;embly of grave doctors and theologians
cautiou&s;ly examined Joan's mi&s;&s;ion, and pronounced it
undoubted and &s;upernatural. She was &s;ent to the par|liament,
then re&s;iding at Poictiers; and was interro|gated
before that a&s;&s;embly: The pre&s;idents, the coun|&s;ellors
who came per&s;uaded of her impo&s;ture, went
away convinced of her in&s;piration. A ray of hope be|gan
to break thro' that de&s;pair, in which the minds of
all men were before enveloped. Heaven had now de|clared
it&s;elf in favour of France, and had laid bare its
out-&s;tretched arm to take vengeance on her invaders.
Few could di&s;tingui&s;h between the impul&s;e of inclination
and the force of conviction; and none would &s;ubmit to
the trouble of &s;o di&s;agreeable a &s;crutiny.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e artificial precautions and preparations
had been for &s;ome time employed, Joan's reque&s;ts were at
la&s;t complied with: She was armed cap-a-pee, mounted
on hor&s;eback, and &s;hown in that martial habiliment be|fore
the whole people. Her dexterity in managing her
&s;teed, tho' acquired in her former occupation, was re|garded
as a new proof of her mi&s;&s;ion; and &s;he was re|ceived
with the loude&s;t acclamations by the &s;pectators.
Her former occupation was even denied: She was no
longer the &s;ervant of an inn. She was converted into a
&s;hepherde&s;s, an employment much more agreeable to
the imagination. To render her &s;till more intere&s;ting,
<PB N="152" REF="164">
near ten years were &s;ubtracted from her age; and all
the &s;entiments of love and of chivalry, were thus united to
tho&s;e of enthu&s;ia&s;m, in order to inflame the fond fancy
of the people with prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in her favour.</P>
<P>WHEN the engine was thus dre&s;&s;ed up in full &s;plen|dor,
it was time to e&s;&s;ay its force again&s;t the enemy,
Joan was &s;ent to Blois, where a large convoy was pre|pared
for the &s;upply of Orleans, and an army of ten
thou&s;and men, under the command of St. Severe, a&s;&s;em|bled
to e&s;cort it. She ordered all the &s;oldiers to confe&s;s
them&s;elves before they &s;et out on the enterprize: She ba|ni&s;hed
from the camp all women of bad fame: She dis|played
in her hands a con&s;ecrated banner; where the Su|preme
Being was repre&s;ented, gra&s;ping the globe of earth,
and &s;urrounded with flower de luces. And &s;he in&s;i&s;ted,
in right of her prophetic mi&s;&s;ion, that the convoy &s;hould
enter Orleans, by the direct road from the &s;ide of
Beau&s;&s;e; but the count de Dunois, unwilling to &s;ubmit
the rules of the military art to her in&s;pirations, ordered
it to approach by the other &s;ide of the river, where, he
knew, the weake&s;t part of the Engli&s;h army was &s;ta|tioned.</P>
<P>PREVIOUS to this attempt, the maid had wrote to the
regent and to the Engli&s;h generals before Orleans, com|manding
them, in the name of the omnipotent Creator,
by whom &s;he was commi&s;&s;ioned, immediately to rai&s;e
the &s;iege and to evacuate France; and menacing them
with divine vengeance in ca&s;e of their di&s;obedience. All
the Engli&s;h affected to &s;peak with deri&s;ion of the maid
and of her heavenly commi&s;&s;ion; and &s;aid, that the
French King was now indeed reduced to a &s;orry pa&s;s,
when he had recour&s;e to &s;uch ridiculous expedients: But
they felt their imagination &s;ecretly &s;truck with the
vehement per&s;ua&s;ion, which prevailed in all around
them; and they waited with an anxious expectation,
<PB N="153" REF="165">
not unmixed with horror, for the i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e extra|ordinary
preparations.</P>
<P>As the convoy approached the river, a &s;ally was made
by the garri&s;on on the &s;ide of Beau&s;&s;e, to prevent the
Engli&s;h general from &s;ending any detachment to the
other &s;ide:<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th April.</NOTE> The provi&s;ions were peaceably embarked in
boats, which the inhabitants of Orleans had &s;ent to re|ceive
them: The maid covered with her troops the em|barkation:
Suffolk ventured not to attack her: And the
French general carried back the army in &s;afety to Blois;
an alteration of affairs, which was already vi&s;ible to all
the world, and which had a proportional effect on the
minds of both parties.</P>
<P>THE maid entered the town of Orleans, arrayed in
her military garb, and di&s;playing her con&s;ecrated &s;tand|ard;
and was received, as a cele&s;tial deliverer, by all
the inhabitants. They now believed them&s;elves invincible
under her &s;acred influence; and Dunois him&s;elf, per|ceiving
&s;uch a mighty alteration both in friends and foes,
con&s;ented, that the next convoy, which was expected in
a few days, &s;hould enter by the &s;ide of Beau&s;&s;e. The
convoy approached:<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th May.</NOTE> No &s;ign of re&s;i&s;tance appeared in
the be&s;iegers: The waggons and troops pa&s;&s;ed without
interruption between the redoubts of the Engli&s;h: A dead
&s;ilence and a&s;toni&s;hment reigned among tho&s;e troops,
formerly &s;o elated with victory, and &s;o fierce for the
combat.</P>
<P>THE earl of Suffolk was in a &s;ituation very unu&s;ual
and extraordinary; and which might well confound the
man of the greate&s;t capacity and firme&s;t temper. He
&s;aw his troops overawed, and &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with the
idea of a divine influence, accompanying the maid. In|&s;tead
of bani&s;hing the&s;e vain terrors by hurry and action
and war, he waited till the &s;oldiers &s;hould recover from
the panic; and he thereby gave lei&s;ure for the&s;e prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions
<PB N="154" REF="166">
to &s;ink &s;till deeper into their minds. The mili|tary
maxims, which are prudent in common ca&s;es, de|ceived
him in the&s;e unaccountable events. The Engli&s;h
felt their courage daunted and overwhelmed; and thence
inferred a divine vengeance hanging over them. The
French drew the &s;ame inference from an inactivity &s;o
new and unexpected. Every circum&s;tance was now re|ver&s;ed
in the opinions of men, on which all depends:
The &s;pirit, re&s;ulting from a long cour&s;e of uninterrupted
&s;ucce&s;s, was on a &s;udden transferred from the victors to
the vanqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE maid called aloud, that the garri&s;on &s;hould re|main
no longer on the defen&s;ive; and &s;he promi&s;ed her
followers the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of heaven in attacking tho&s;e re|doubts
of the enemy, which had &s;o long kept them in
awe, and which they had never hitherto dared to in&s;ult.
The generals &s;econded her ardour: An attack was made
on one redoubt, and it proved &s;ucce&s;sful<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 45.</NOTE>: All the Engli&s;h,
who defended the entrenchments, were put to the &s;word
or taken pri&s;oners: And Sir John Talbot him&s;elf, who
had drawn together, from the other redoubts, &s;ome
troops to bring them relief, dared not to appear in the
open field again&s;t &s;o formidable an enemy.</P>
<P>NOTHING &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible after this &s;ucce&s;s to the
Maid and her enthu&s;ia&s;tic votaries. She urged the ge|nerals
to attack the main body of the Engli&s;h in their
entrenchments: But Dunois, &s;till unwilling to hazard
the fate of France by too great temerity, and &s;en&s;ible
that the lea&s;t rever&s;e of fortune would make all the pre|&s;ent
vi&s;ions evaporate, and re&s;tore every thing to its
former condition, checked her vehemence, and propo&s;ed
to her fir&s;t to expel the enemy from their forts on the
other &s;ide of the river, and thus lay the communication
<PB N="155" REF="167">
with the country entirely open, before &s;he attempted any
more hazardous enterprize. Joan was per&s;uaded, and
the&s;e forts were vigorou&s;ly a&s;&s;ailed. In one attack the
French were repul&s;ed; the maid was left almo&s;t alone; &s;he
was obliged to retreat, and join the runaways; but di&s;|playing
her &s;acred &s;tandard, and animating them with her
countenance, her ge&s;tures, her exhortations, &s;he led
them back to the charge, and overpowered the Engli&s;h
in their entrenchments. In the attack of another fort, &s;he
was wounded in the neck with an arrow; &s;he retreated
a moment behind the a&s;&s;ailants; &s;he pulled out the arrow
with her own hands; &s;he had the wound quickly dre&s;&s;ed;
and &s;he ha&s;tened back to head the troops, and to plant
her victorious banner on the ramparts of the enemy.</P>
<P>BY all the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, the Engli&s;h were entirely chaced
from their fortifications on that &s;ide: They had lo&s;t above
&s;ix thou&s;and men in the&s;e different actions; and what
was &s;till more important, their wonted courage and con|fidence
was wholly gone, and had given place to amaze|ment
and de&s;pair. The Maid returned triumphant over
the bridge, and was again received as the guardian angel
of the city. After performing &s;uch miracles, &s;he con|vinced
the mo&s;t obdurate incredulity of her divine mi&s;|&s;ion:
Men felt them&s;elves animated as by a &s;uperior
energy, and thought nothing impo&s;&s;ible to that divine
hand, which &s;o vi&s;ibly conducted them. It was in vain
even for the Engli&s;h generals to oppo&s;e with their &s;oldiers
the prevailing opinion of &s;upernatural influence: They
them&s;elves were probably moved with the &s;ame belief:
The utmo&s;t they dared to advance, was, that Joan was
not an in&s;trument of God; &s;he was only the implement
of the Devil: But as the Engli&s;h had felt, to their &s;ad
experience, that the Devil might be allowed &s;ometimes
to prevail, they derived not much con&s;olation from the
enforcing of this opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="168">
IT might prove extremely dangerous for Suffolk, with
&s;uch intimidated troops, to remain any longer in the
pre&s;ence of &s;uch a courageous and victorious enemy; and
he therefore rai&s;ed the &s;iege,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;iege of Orleans rai&s;ed.</NOTE> and retreated with all the
precautions imaginable. The French re&s;olved to pu&s;h
their conque&s;ts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th May.</NOTE> and to allow the Engli&s;h no lei&s;ure to
recover from their con&s;ternation. Charles formed a
body of &s;ix thou&s;and men, and &s;ent them to attack Jer|geau,
whither Suffolk had retired with a detachment of
his army. The &s;iege la&s;ted ten days; and the place
was ob&s;tinately defended. Joan di&s;played her wonted
intrepidity on this occa&s;ion. She de&s;cended into the
fo&s;&s;ee, in leading the attack; and &s;he there received a
blow on the head with a &s;tone, by which &s;he was con|founded
and beat to the ground: But &s;he &s;oon recovered
her&s;elf; and in the end rendered the a&s;&s;ault &s;ucce&s;sful:
Suffolk was obliged to yield him&s;elf pri&s;oner to a French|man
called Renaud; but before he &s;ubmitted, he a&s;ked
his adver&s;ary, whether he was a gentleman. On receiv|ing
a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, he demanded, whether he was
a knight. Renaud replied, that he had not yet attained
that honour. <HI>Then I make you one,</HI> replied Suffolk: Upon
which, he gave him the blow with his &s;word, which
dubbed him into that fraternity; and he immediately
&s;urrendered him&s;elf his pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>THE remainder of the Engli&s;h army was commanded
by Fa&s;tolffe, Scales and Talbot, who thought of nothing
but of making their retreat, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, into a
place of &s;afety; while the French e&s;teemed the overtaking
them equivalent to a victory. So much had the events,
which pa&s;&s;ed before Orleans, altered every thing between
the two nations! The vanguard of the French under
Xaintrailles attacked the rear of the enemy at the village
of Patay.<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th June.</NOTE> The battle la&s;ted not a moment: The Eng|li&s;h
were di&s;comfited and fled: The brave Fa&s;tolffe him|&s;elf
<PB N="157" REF="169">
&s;howed the example of flight to his troops; and the
order of the garter was taken from him, as a puni&s;h|ment
for this in&s;tance of cowardice<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 46.</NOTE>. Two thou&s;and
men were killed in this action; and both Talbot and
Scales taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>IN the account of all the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, the French
writers, to magnify the wonder, repre&s;ent the maid
(who was now known by the appellation of <HI>the Maid
of Orleans</HI>) as not only active in the combats, but as per|forming
the office of general; directing the troops, con|ducting
the military operations, and &s;waying the delibe|rations
in all councils of war. It is certain, that the
policy of the French court endeavoured to maintain this
appearance with the public: But it is much more pro|bable,
that Dunois and the wi&s;er commanders prompted
her in all her mea&s;ures, than that a country girl, with|out
experience or education, could, on a &s;udden, be|come
expert in a profe&s;&s;ion, which requires more genius
and capacity, than any other active &s;cene of life. It is &s;uf|ficient
prai&s;e, that &s;he could di&s;tingui&s;h the per&s;ons on
who&s;e judgment &s;he might rely; that &s;he could &s;eize
their hints and &s;ugge&s;tions, and, on a &s;udden, deliver
their opinion as her own; and that &s;he could curb, on
occa&s;ion, that vi&s;ionary and enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit, with which
&s;he was undoubtedly actuated, and could temper it with
prudence and di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>THE rai&s;ing of the &s;iege of Orleans was one part of
the maid's promi&s;e to Charles: The crowning him at
Rheims was the other: And &s;he now in&s;i&s;ted vehemently,
that he &s;hould forthwith &s;et out on that enterprize. A
few weeks before, &s;uch a propo&s;al would have appeared
the mo&s;t extravagant in the world. Rheims lay in a
di&s;tant quarter of the kingdom; was then in the hands
<PB N="158" REF="170">
of a victorious enemy; the whole road, which led to it,
was occupied by their garri&s;ons; and no imagination
could be &s;o &s;anguine as to think, that &s;uch an attempt
could &s;o &s;oon come within the bounds of po&s;&s;ibility.
But as it was extremely the intere&s;t of Charles to main|tain
the belief of &s;omething extraordinary and divine in
the&s;e events, and to avail him&s;elf of the pre&s;ent con&s;ter|nation
of the Engli&s;h; he re&s;olved to follow the exhor|tations
of his warlike prophete&s;s, and to lead his army
upon this promi&s;ing adventure. Hitherto, he had kept
remote from the &s;cene of war: As the &s;afety of the &s;tate
depended entirely upon his per&s;on, he had been per|&s;uaded
to re&s;train his military ardour: But ob&s;erving this
pro&s;perous turn of affairs, he now determined to appear
at the head of his armies, and to &s;et the example of va|lour
to all his &s;oldiers. And the French nobility &s;aw
at once their young &s;overeign a&s;&s;uming a new and more
brilliant character, &s;econded by fortune, and conducted
by the hand of heaven; and they caught fre&s;h zeal to
exert them&s;elves in replacing him on the throne of his
ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>CHARLES &s;et out for Rheims at the head of twelve
thou&s;and men:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of France crowned at Rheims.</NOTE> He pa&s;&s;ed by Troye, which opened its
gates to him: Chalons imitated the example: Rheims
&s;ent him a deputation with its keys, before his approach
to it: And he &s;carce perceived, as he pa&s;&s;ed along, that
he was marching thro' an enemy's country. The cere|mony
of his coronation was here performed<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 48.</NOTE> with the
holy oil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th July.</NOTE> which a pigeon had brought to King Clovis
from heaven, on the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment of the French
monarchy: The maid of Orleans &s;tood by his &s;ide, in
compleat armour, and di&s;playing her &s;acred banner,
which had &s;o often di&s;&s;ipated and confounded his fierce&s;t
<PB N="159" REF="171">
enemies: And the people &s;houted with the mo&s;t unfeign|ed
joy, on viewing &s;uch a complication of wonders.
After the completion of the ceremony, the Maid threw
her&s;elf at the King's feet, embraced his knees, and with
a flood of tears, which plea&s;ure and tenderne&s;s extorted
from her, &s;he congratulated him on this &s;ingular and
marvellous event.</P>
<P>CHARLES, thus crowned and anointed, became more
venerable in the eyes of all his &s;ubjects, and &s;eemed,
in a manner, to receive anew, from a heavenly commi&s;|&s;ion,
his title to their allegiance. The inclinations of
men &s;waying their belief, no one doubted of the in&s;pira|tions
and prophetic &s;pirit of the Maid: So many inci|dents,
which pa&s;&s;ed all human comprehen&s;ion, left little
room to que&s;tion a &s;uperior influence: And the real and
undoubted facts gave credit to every exaggeration, which
could &s;carce be rendered more wonderful. Laon, Soi&s;|&s;ons,
Chateau-Thierri, Provins, and many other towns
and fortre&s;&s;es in that neighbourhood, immediately after
Charles's coronation, &s;ubmitted to him on the fir&s;t &s;um|mons;
and the whole nation was di&s;po&s;ed to give him
the mo&s;t zealous te&s;timonies of their duty and affection.</P>
<P>NOTHING can impre&s;s us with a higher idea of the
wi&s;dom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prudence of the duke of Bedford.</NOTE> addre&s;s, and re&s;olution of the duke of Bedford,
than his being able to maintain him&s;elf in &s;o perilous a
&s;ituation, and to pre&s;erve &s;ome footing in France, after
the defection of &s;o many places, and amid&s;t the univer|&s;al
inclination of the re&s;t to imitate that contagious
example. This prince &s;eemed pre&s;ent every where by
his vigilance and fore&s;ight: He employed each re&s;ource,
which fortune had yet left him: He held all the Eng|li&s;h
garri&s;ons in a po&s;ture of defence: He kept a watch|ful
eye over every attempt among the French towards
an in&s;urrection: He retained the Pari&s;ians in obedience,
by employing alternately care&s;&s;es and &s;everity: And
<PB N="160" REF="172">
knowing that the duke of Burgundy was already wa|vering
in his fidelity, he acted with &s;o much &s;kill and
prudence, as to renew, in this dangerous cri&s;is, an al|liance,
which was &s;o important to the credit and &s;upport
of the Engli&s;h government.</P>
<P>THE &s;mall &s;upplies which he received from England
&s;et the talents of this great man in &s;till a &s;tronger light.
The ardour of the Engli&s;h for foreign conque&s;ts was now
extremely abated by time and reflection: The parliament
&s;eems even to have become &s;en&s;ible of the danger, which
might attend their farther progre&s;s: No &s;upply of money
could be obtained by the regent during his greate&s;t di&s;|tre&s;&s;es;
and men inli&s;ted &s;lowly under his &s;tandard, or
&s;oon de&s;erted, by rea&s;on of the wonderful accounts,
which had reached England, of the magic, and &s;orcery,
and diabolical power of the maid of Orleans<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. x. p. 459. 472.</NOTE>. It hap|pened
fortunately, in this emergency, that the bi&s;hop
of Winche&s;ter, now created a cardinal, landed at Calais
with a body of 5000 men, which he was conducting into
Bohemia, on$ cru&s;ade again&s;t the Hu&s;&s;ites. He was per|&s;uaded
to lend the&s;e troops to his nephew during the pre|&s;ent
difficulties<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. x. p. 421.</NOTE>; and the regent was thereby enabled to
take the field, and to oppo&s;e the French King, who was
advancing with his army to the gates of Paris.</P>
<P>THE extraordinary capacity of the duke of Bedford
appeared al&s;o in his military operations. He attempted
to re&s;tore the courage of his troops by boldly advancing
to the face of the enemy; but he cho&s;e his po&s;ts with &s;o
much caution, as always to decline a combat, and to
render it impo&s;&s;ible for Charles to attack him. He &s;till
attended that prince in all his movements; covered his
own towns and garri&s;ons; and kept him&s;elf in a po&s;ture
to reap advantage from every imprudence or fal&s;e &s;tep of
<PB N="161" REF="173">
the enemy. The French army, which con&s;i&s;ted mo&s;tly
of volunteers, who &s;erved at their own expence, &s;oon
after retired and was di&s;&s;olved: Charles went to Bourges,
the ordinary place of his re&s;idence; but not till he made
him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Compiegne, Beauvais, Senlis, Sens,
Laval, Lagni, St. Denis, and of many places in the
neighbourhood of Paris, which the affections of the
people had put into his hands.</P>
<P>THE regent endeavoured to revive the declining &s;tate
of his affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1430.</NOTE> by bringing over the young King of Eng|land,
and having him crowned and acknowledged King
of France at Paris<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. x. p. 432.</NOTE>. All the va&s;&s;als of the crown, who
lived within the provinces po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h, &s;wore
anew allegiance and did homage to him. But this cere|mony
was cold and in&s;ipid in compari&s;on of the eclat
which had attended the coronation of Charles at Rheims;
and the duke of Bedford expected more effect from an
accident, which put into his hands the per&s;on, who had
been the author of all his calamities.</P>
<P>THE maid of Orleans, after the coronation of Charles,
declared to the count de Dunois, that her wi&s;hes were
now &s;atisfied, and that &s;he had no farther de&s;ire than to
return to her former condition, and to the occupations
and cour&s;e of life, which became her &s;ex: But that
nobleman, &s;en&s;ible of the mighty advantages, which
might &s;till be reaped from her pre&s;ence in the army, ex|horted
her to per&s;evere, till, by the final expul&s;ion of
the Engli&s;h, &s;he had brought all her prophecies to their
full completion. In pur&s;uance of this advice, &s;he threw
her&s;elf into the town of Compiegne, which was at that
time be&s;ieged by the duke of Burgundy, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the
earls of Arundel and Suffolk; and the garri&s;on on her
<PB N="162" REF="174">
appearance believed them&s;elves thenceforth invincible.
But their joy was of &s;hort duration. The Maid, next
day after her arrival, headed a &s;ally upon the quarters of
John de Luxembourg;<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th May.</NOTE> &s;he twice drove the enemy from
their entrenchments; finding their numbers to encrea&s;e
every moment, &s;he ordered a retreat; when hard pre&s;&s;ed
by the pur&s;uers, &s;he turned upon them, and made them
again recoil; but being here de&s;erted by her friends, and
&s;urrounded by the enemy, &s;he was at la&s;t, after exerting
the utmo&s;t valour, taken pri&s;oner by the Burgundians<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 371.</NOTE>.
The common opinion was, that the French officers,
finding the merit of every victory a&s;cribed to her, had,
in envy to her renown, by which they them&s;elves were
&s;o much eclip&s;ed, willingly expo&s;ed her to this fatal
accident.</P>
<P>THE envy of her friends on this occa&s;ion was not a
greater proof of her merit than the triumph of her ene|mies.
A complete victory would not have given more
joy to the Engli&s;h and their partizans. The &s;ervice of
<HI>Te Deum,</HI> which has &s;o often been prophaned by princes,
was publicly celebrated on this fortunate event at Paris.
The duke of Bedford fancied, that, by the captivity of
that extraordinary woman, who had bla&s;ted all his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es,
he would again recover his former a&s;cendant over
France; and to pu&s;h farther the pre&s;ent advantage, he
purcha&s;ed the captive from John de Luxembourg, and
formed a pro&s;ecution again&s;t her, which, whether it pro|ceeded
from vengeance or policy, was equally barbarous,
and di&s;honourable.</P>
<P>THERE was no po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1431.</NOTE> why Joan &s;hould not
be regarded as a pri&s;oner of war, and be entitled to all
the courte&s;y and good u&s;age, which civilized nations
<PB N="163" REF="175">
practi&s;e towards enemies on the&s;e occa&s;ions. She had
never, in her military capacity, forfeited, by any act of
treachery or cruelty, her claim to that treatment: She
was un&s;tained with any civil crime: Even the virtues
and the very decorums of her &s;ex had ever been rigidly
ob&s;erved by her<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">We learn from her trial in Pa&s;quier, that when accu&s;ed of having put to death Franquet d' Arras her pri&s;oner, &s;he ju&s;tified her&s;elf by &s;ay|ing, that he was a known robber, and lay under &s;entence of death by a civil magi&s;trate. She was &s;o careful of ob&s;erving decorums, that, when &s;he was in any town or garri&s;on, &s;he always went to bed with &s;ome women of character in the place: When in the camp, &s;he lay in armour, and always had one of her brothers on each &s;ide of her. The Engli&s;h never reproached her with any thing in regard to her morals.</NOTE>: And tho' her appearing in war, and
leading armies to battle, may &s;eem an exception, &s;he had
thereby performed &s;uch &s;ignal &s;ervice to her prince, that
&s;he had abundantly compen&s;ated for this irregularity;
and was even, on that very account, the more an object
of prai&s;e and admiration. It was nece&s;&s;ary, therefore,
for the duke of Bedford to intere&s;t religion &s;ome way in
the pro&s;ecution; and to cover under that cloak his fla|grant
violation of ju&s;tice and humanity.</P>
<P>THE bi&s;hop of Beauvais, a man wholly devoted to the
Engli&s;h intere&s;t, pre&s;ented a petition again&s;t Joan, on
pretence, that &s;he was taken within the bounds of his
dioce&s;e, and he de&s;ired to have her tried by an eccle&s;ia&s;|tical
court for &s;orcery, impiety, idolatry and magic:
The univer&s;ity of Paris was &s;o mean as to join in the
&s;ame reque&s;t: Several prelates, among whom the car|dinal
of Winche&s;ter was the only Engli&s;hman, were ap|pointed
her judges: They held their court in Ro&uuml;en,
where the young King of England then re&s;ided: And
the Maid, cloathed in her former military apparel, but
loaded with irons, was produced before this tribunal.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="176">
SHE fir&s;t de&s;ired to be ea&s;ed of her chains: Her judges
an&s;wered that &s;he had once already attempted an e&s;cape
by throwing her&s;elf from a tower: She confe&s;&s;ed the
fact, maintained the ju&s;tice of her intention, and owned,
that, if &s;he could, &s;he would &s;till execute that purpo&s;e.
All her other &s;peeches &s;howed the &s;ame firmne&s;s and in|trepidity:
Tho' harra&s;&s;ed with interrogatories, during
near the cour&s;e of four months, &s;he never betrayed any
weakne&s;s or womani&s;h &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and no advantage
was gained over her. The point, which her judges
pu&s;hed mo&s;t vehemently, was her vi&s;ions and revelations
and intercour&s;e with departed &s;aints; and they a&s;ked her,
whether &s;he would &s;ubmit to the church the truth of
the&s;e in&s;pirations: She replied, that &s;he would &s;ubmit
them to God, the fountain of truth. They then ex|claimed,
that &s;he was a heretic, and denied the autho|rity
of the church. She appealed to the Pope: They re|jected
her appeal.</P>
<P>THEY a&s;ked her, why &s;he put tru&s;t in her &s;tandard
which had been con&s;ecrated by magical incantations:
She replied, that &s;he put tru&s;t in the Supreme Being
alone, who&s;e image was impre&s;&s;ed upon it. They de|manded,
why &s;he carried in her hand that &s;tandard at
the anointment and coronation of Charles at Rheims:
She an&s;wered, that the per&s;on, who had &s;hared the dan|ger,
was entitled to &s;hare the glory. When accu&s;ed of
going to war contrary to the decorums of her &s;ex, and
of a&s;&s;uming government and command over men; &s;he
&s;crupled not to reply, that her &s;ole purpo&s;e was to defeat

JOAN, &s;o long &s;urrounded by inveterate enemies, who
treated her with every mark of contumely; brow-beaten
and overawed by men of &s;uperior rank, and men inve&s;ted
with the en&s;igns of a &s;acred character, which &s;he had
been accu&s;tomed to revere; felt her &s;pirit at la&s;t &s;ubdued,
and tho&s;e vi&s;ionary dreams of in&s;piration, in which &s;he
had been buoyed up by the triumphs of &s;ucce&s;s and the
applau&s;es of her own party, gave way to the terrors of
that puni&s;hment to which &s;he was &s;entenced. She pub|licly
declared her&s;elf willing to recant; &s;he acknowledged
the illu&s;ion of tho&s;e revelations which the church had re|jected;
and &s;he promi&s;ed never more to maintain them.
Her &s;entence was then mitigated: She was condemned
to perpetual impri&s;onment, and to be fed during life on

<P>ENOUGH was now done to fulfil all political views,
and to convince both the French and the Engli&s;h, that
the opinion of divine influence, which had &s;o much en|couraged
the one and daunted the other, was entirely
without foundation. But the barbarous vengeance of
Joan's enemies was not &s;atisfied with this victory. Su&s;|pecting,
that the female dre&s;s, which &s;he had $ow con|&s;ented
to wear, was di&s;agreeable to her, they purpo&s;ely
placed in her apartment a &s;uit of men's apparel; and
watched for the effect of that temptation upon her. On
the &s;ight of a dre&s;s, in which &s;he had acquired &s;o much
renown, and which &s;he once believed, &s;he wore by the
particular appointment of heaven, all her former ideas
and pa&s;&s;ions revived; and &s;he ventured in her &s;olitude to
cloath her&s;elf again in the forbidden garment. Her in|&s;idious
enemies caught her in that &s;ituation: Her fault
was interpreted to be no le&s;s than a relap&s;e into here&s;y:
No recantation would now &s;uffice, and no pardon could
be granted her. She was condemned to be burned in
the market-place of Ro&uuml;en; and the infamous &s;entence

whom the more generous &s;uper&s;tition of the antients

magic,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of the maid of Orleans.</NOTE> delivered over alive to the flames, and expiated
by that dreadful puni&s;hment the &s;ignal &s;ervices, which
&s;he had rendered to her prince and to her native country.<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th June.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE affairs of the Engli&s;h,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1432.</NOTE> far from being advanced by
this execution, went every day more and more to decay:
The great abilities of the regent were unable to re&s;i&s;t the
&s;trong inclination, which had &s;eized the French to return
under the obedience of their rightful &s;overeign, and
which that act of cruelty was ill fitted to remove.
Chartres was &s;urprized by a &s;tratagem of the count de
Dunois: A body of the Engli&s;h, under lord Willoughby,
was defeated at St. Celerin upon the Sarte<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 100.</NOTE>: The fair
in the &s;uburbs of Ca&euml;n, &s;eated in the mid&s;t of the Engli&s;h
territories, was pillaged by de Lore, a French captain
of reputation: The duke of Bedford him&s;elf was obliged
by Dunois to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Lagni with &s;ome di&s;|honour:
And all the&s;e misfortunes, tho' light, yet be|ing
continued and uninterrupted, brought di&s;credit to
the Engli&s;h, and menaced them with an approaching lo&s;s
of all their conque&s;ts. But the chief detriment, which
the regent &s;u&s;tained, was by the death of his dutche&s;s,
who had hitherto pre&s;erved &s;ome appearance of friend&s;hip
between him and her brother, the duke of Burgundy<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. ii. p. 87.</NOTE>:
And his marriage &s;oon afterwards, with Jaqueline of
Luxembourg, was the beginning of a breach between
them<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 373. Grafton, p. 554.</NOTE>. Philip complained, that the regent had never
had the civility to inform him of his intentions, and
that &s;o &s;udden a marriage was a &s;light on his &s;i&s;ter's me|mory.
The cardinal of Winche&s;ter mediated a recon|ciliation
<PB N="167" REF="179">
between the&s;e princes, and brought them both
to St. Omers for that purpo&s;e. The duke of Bedford
here expected the fir&s;t vi&s;it both as he was &s;on, brother,
and uncle to a King, and becau&s;e he had already made
&s;uch advances as to come into the duke of Burgundy's
territories, in order to have an interview with him: But
Philip, proud of his great power and independant domi|nions,
refu&s;ed to pay this compliment to the regent: And
the two princes, unable to adju&s;t the ceremonial, parted
without &s;eeing each other<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 90. Grafton, p. 561.</NOTE>. A very bad progno&s;tic of
their cordial intentions to renew pa&s;t friend&s;hip and
amity!</P>
<P>NOTHING could be more repugnant to the intere&s;ts of
the hou&s;e of Burgun|dy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defection of the duke of Burgundy.</NOTE> than to unite the crowns of
France and England on the &s;ame head; an event, which,
had it taken place, would have reduced the duke to the
rank of a petty prince, and have rendered his &s;ituation
entirely dependant and precarious. The title al&s;o to the
crown of France, which, after the failure of the elder
branches, might accrue to the duke or his po&s;terity, had
been &s;acrificed by the treaty of Troye; and &s;trangers
and enemies were thereby irrevocably fixed upon the
throne. Revenge alone had carried Philip into the&s;e im|politic
mea&s;ures; and a point of honour had hitherto in|duced
him to maintain them. But as it is the nature of
pa&s;&s;ion gradually to decay; while the &s;en&s;e of intere&s;t
maintains an eternal influence and authority; the duke
had, for &s;ome years, appeared &s;en&s;ibly to relent in his
animo&s;ity again&s;t Charles, and to hearken willingly to
the apologies made by that prince for the murder of the
late duke of Burgundy. His extreme youth was pleaded
in his favour; his incapacity to judge for him&s;elf; the
a&s;cendant gained over him by his mini&s;ters; and his in|ability
<PB N="168" REF="180">
to re&s;ent a deed, which, without his knowledge,
had been perpetrated by tho&s;e under who&s;e guidance he
was then placed. The more to gratify the pride of Philip,
the King of France had bani&s;hed from his court and
pre&s;ence Tanegui de Chatel, and all tho&s;e concerned in
that a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; and had offered to make any other
atonement, which could be required of him. The ills,
which Charles had already &s;uffered, had tended to gratify
the duke's revenge; the mi&s;eries to which France had
been &s;o long expo&s;ed, had begun to move his compa&s;|&s;ion;
and the cries of all Europe admoni&s;hed him, that
his re&s;entment, which might hitherto be deemed pious,
would, if carried farther, be univer&s;ally condemned as
barbarous and unrelenting. While the duke was in this
di&s;po&s;ition, every di&s;gu&s;t, which he received from Eng|land,
made a double impre&s;&s;ion upon him; the entreaties
of the count de Richemont and the duke of Bourbon, who
had married his two &s;i&s;ters, had weight; and he deter|mined
finally to unite him&s;elf to the royal family of
France, from which his own was de&s;cended. For this
purpo&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1435.</NOTE> a congre&s;s was appointed at Arras under the
mediation of deputies from the Pope and the council of Ba&s;$e:
The duke of Burgundy came thither in per&s;on:
The duke of Bourbon, the count de Richemont and
other per&s;ons of high rank, appeared as amba&s;&s;adors from
France: And the Engli&s;h having al&s;o been invited to
attend, the cardinal of Winche&s;ter, the archbi&s;hop of
York, and others, received from the protector and
council a commi&s;&s;ion for that purpo&s;e<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 110.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE conferences were held in the abbey of St. Vaa&s;t;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t.</NOTE>
and began with di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the propo&s;als of the two
crowns, which were &s;o wide of each other as to admit
of no hopes of accommodation. England offered, that
<PB N="169" REF="181">
each party &s;hould remain in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they had
at pre&s;ent, after making &s;ome equal exchanges for mutual
convenience: France offered to cede Normandy with
Guienne, but both of them loaded with the u&s;ual homage
and va&s;&s;alage to the crown. As the claims of England
upon France were univer&s;ally unpopular in Europe; the
mediators declared the offers of Charles very rea&s;onable;
and the cardinal of Winche&s;ter, with the Engli&s;h amba&s;|&s;adors,
immediately left the congre&s;s. There remained
nothing but to di&s;cu&s;s the mutual preten&s;ions of Charles
and Philip. The&s;e were ea&s;ily adju&s;ted: The va&s;&s;al was
in a &s;ituation to give law to his &s;uperior; and he exact|ed
conditions, which, had it not been for the pre&s;ent ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
would have been deemed, to the la&s;t degree, di&s;|honourable
and di&s;advantageous to the crown of France.
Be&s;ides making repeated atonements and acknowledge|ments
for the murder of the duke of Burgundy, Charles
was obliged to cede all the towns of Picardy which lay
between the Somme and the Low Countries; he yielded
&s;everal other territories; he agreed, that the&s;e and all the
other dominions of Philip &s;hould be held by him, during
his life-time, without doing any homage or &s;wearing
fealty to the pre&s;ent King; and he freed his &s;ubjects
from all obligations to allegiance, if ever he infringed
this treaty<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 112. Gra&s;ton, p. 565.</NOTE>. Such were the conditions, upon which
France purcha&s;ed the friend&s;hip of the duke of Bur|gundy.</P>
<P>THE duke &s;ent over a herald to England with a letter,
in which he notified the conclu&s;ion of the treaty of Ar|ras,
and apologized for his departure from that of Troye.
The council received the herald with great coldne&s;s:
They even a&s;&s;igned him his lodgings in a &s;hoemaker's
hou&s;e, by way of in&s;ult; and the populace were &s;o in|cen&s;ed,
<PB N="170" REF="182">
that, if the duke of Gloce&s;ter had not given him
guards, his life would have been expo&s;ed to danger, when
he appeared in the &s;treets. The Flemings, and other
&s;ubjects of Philip, were in&s;ulted, and &s;ome of them mur|dered
by the Londoners; and every thing &s;eemed to tend
towards a rupture between the two nations<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 120. Holling&s;hed, p. 612.</NOTE>. The&s;e
violences were not di&s;agreeable to the duke of Burgundy;
as they afforded him a pretence for the farther mea&s;ures,
which he intended to take again&s;t the Engli&s;h, whom
he now regarded as implacable and dangerous enemies.</P>
<P>A FEW days after the duke of Bedford received intel|ligence<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th Sept. Death of the duke of Bedford.</NOTE>
of this treaty, &s;o fatal to the intere&s;ts of England,
he died at Ro&uuml;en; a prince of great abilities, and of
many virtues; and who&s;e memory, except from the bar|barous
execution of the maid of Orleans, was un&s;ullied
by any con&s;iderable blemi&s;h. I&s;abella, Queen of France,
died a little before him, de&s;pi&s;ed by the Engli&s;h, dete&s;ted
by the French, and reduced in her latter years to regard
with an unnatural horror, the progre&s;s and &s;ucce&s;&s;es of
her own &s;on, in recovering po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his kingdom.
This period was al&s;o &s;ignalized by the death of the earl
of Arundel<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 105. Holling&s;hed, p. 610.</NOTE>, a great Engli&s;h general, who, tho' he
commanded three thou&s;and men, was foiled by Xain|trailles
at the head of &s;ix hundred, and &s;oon after expired
of the wounds which he received in the action.</P>
<P>THE violent factions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1436.</NOTE> which prevailed in the court
of England, between the duke of Gloce&s;ter and the car|dinal
of Winche&s;ter, prevented the Engli&s;h from taking
the proper mea&s;ures for repairing the&s;e multiplied lo&s;&s;es;
and threw all their affairs into confu&s;ion. The popu|larity
of the duke and his near relation to the crown,
gave him advantages in the conte&s;t, which he often lo&s;t
<PB N="171" REF="183">
by his open and unguarded temper, unfit to &s;truggle
with the politic and intere&s;ted &s;pirit of his rival. The
balance, meanwhile, of the&s;e parties, kept every thing
in &s;u&s;pence: Foreign affairs were much neglected: And
tho' the duke of York, &s;on to that earl of Cam|bridge,
who was executed in the beginning of the la&s;t
reign, was appointed &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the duke of Bedford,
it was &s;even months before his commi&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed the
&s;eals; and the Engli&s;h remained &s;o long in an enemy's
country, without a proper head or governor.</P>
<P>THE new governor on his arrival found the capital
already lo&s;t.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Decline of the Engli&s;h in France.</NOTE> The Pari&s;ians had always been more at|tached
to the Burgundian than to the Engli&s;h intere&s;t;
and after the conclu&s;ion of the treaty of Arras, their
affections, without any farther controul, univer&s;ally led
them to return to their allegiance under their native &s;o|vereign.
The con&s;table, together with Lile-Adam, the
&s;ame per&s;on who had before put Paris into the hands of
the duke of Burgundy, was introduced in the night-time
by intelligence with the citizens: The lord Willoughby,
who commanded only a &s;mall garri&s;on of 1500 men, was
expelled: That nobleman di&s;covered great valour and pre|&s;ence
of mind on the occa&s;ion; but unable to guard
&s;o large a place again&s;t &s;uch multitudes, he retired into
the Ba&s;tile, and being there inve&s;ted, delivered up the
place, and was contented to &s;tipulate for the &s;afe retreat
of his troops into Normandy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 127. Grafton, p. 568.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, the duke of Burgundy took
openly part again&s;t England, and commenced ho&s;tili|ties
by the &s;iege of Calais, the only place which now
gave the Engli&s;h any &s;ure hold of France, and &s;till ren|dered
them dangerous. As he was beloved among his
own &s;ubjects, and had acquired the epithet of <HI>Good,</HI> from
<PB N="172" REF="184">
his popular qualities, he was able to intere&s;t all the in|habitants
of the Low-Countries in the &s;ucce&s;s of this
enterprize; and he inve&s;ted that place with an army,
very formidable from its numbers, but without experi|ence,
di&s;cipline, or military &s;pirit<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 126. 130. 132. Holling&s;hed, p. 613. Grafton, p. 571.</NOTE>. On the fir&s;t alarm
of this &s;iege, the duke of Gloce&s;ter a&s;&s;embled &s;ome for|ces,
&s;ent a defiance to Philip, and challenged him to
wait the event of a battle, which he promi&s;ed to give,
as &s;oon as the wind would permit him to reach Calais.
The warlike genius of the Engli&s;h had at that time
rendered them terrible to all the northern parts of Europe;
much more to the Flemings, who were more expert in
manufactures, than in arms; and the duke of Burgundy,
being already foiled in &s;ome attempts before Calais, and
ob&s;erving the di&s;content and terror of his own army,
thought proper to rai&s;e the &s;iege, and to retreat into his<NOTE PLACE="marg">26th June.</NOTE>
own territories, before the arrival of the enemy<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. ii. p. 136. Holling&s;hed, p. 614.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h were &s;till ma&s;ters of many fine provin|ces
in France; but retained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, more by the ex|treme
weakne&s;s of Charles, than by the &s;trength of their
own garri&s;ons or the force of their armies. Nothing
indeed can be more &s;urpri&s;ing than the feeble efforts
made, during the cour&s;e of &s;everal years, by the&s;e two
potent nations again&s;t each other; while the one &s;trug|gled
for independancy, and the other a&s;pired to a total
conque&s;t of its rival. The general want of indu&s;try,
commerce, and police, in that age, had rendered all the
European nations, and France and England no le&s;s than
the others, unfit for bearing the burthens of war, when
it was prolonged beyond one &s;ea&s;on; and the continu|ance
of ho&s;tilities had, long ere this time, exhau&s;ted the
force and patience of both the&s;e kingdoms. Scarce
<PB N="173" REF="185">
could the appearance of an army be brought into the
field on either &s;ide; and all the mighty operations con|&s;i&s;ted
in the &s;urprize of places, in the rencounter of de|tached
parties, and in incur&s;ions upon the open coun|try;
which were performed by &s;mall bodies a&s;&s;embled
on a &s;udden from the neighbouring garri&s;ons. In this
method of conducting the war, the French King had
much the advantage: The affections of the people were
entirely on his &s;ide: Intelligence was early brought him
of the &s;tate and motions of the enemy: The inhabitants
were ready to join in any attempts again&s;t the garri&s;ons:
And thus ground was continually, tho' &s;lowly, gained
again&s;t the Engli&s;h. The duke of York, who was a
prince of ability, &s;truggled again&s;t the&s;e difficulties during
the cour&s;e of five years; and being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the valour
of lord Talbot, &s;oon after created earl of Shrew&s;bury,
he performed actions which acquired him honour, but
merit not the attention of po&s;terity. It would have been
well, had this feeble war, in &s;paring the blood of the
people, prevented likewi&s;e all other oppre&s;&s;ions; and
had the fury of men, which rea&s;on and ju&s;tice cannot
re&s;train, thus happily received a check from their impo|tence
and inability. But the French and Engli&s;h, tho'
they exerted &s;uch &s;mall force, were, however, &s;tretching
beyond their re&s;ources, which were &s;till &s;maller; and the
troops, de&s;titute of pay, were obliged to &s;ub&s;i&s;t by plun|dering
and oppre&s;&s;ing the country, both of friends and
enemies. The fields in all the north of France, which
was the &s;eat of war, were laid wa&s;te and left unculti|vated<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 562.</NOTE>.
The cities were gradually depopulated, not by
the blood &s;pilt in battle, but by the more de&s;tructive pil|lage
of the garri&s;ons: And both parties, weary of ho&s;ti|lities,
which decided nothing, &s;eemed at la&s;t de&s;irous of
<PB N="174" REF="186">
peace, and they &s;et on foot negotiations for that pur|po&s;e.
But the propo&s;als which came from France and
from England, were &s;till &s;o wide of each other, that all
hopes of accommodation immediately vani&s;hed. The
Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;adors demanded re&s;titution of all the pro|vinces
which had once been annexed to England, to|gether
with the final ce&s;&s;ion of Calais and its di&s;trict;
and required the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e exten&s;ive terri|tories
without the burthen of any fealty or homage
on the part of their prince: The French offered only
part of Guienne, part of Normandy, and Calais, loaded
with the u&s;ual burthens. It appeared in vain to continue
the negociation, while there was &s;o little pro&s;pect of
agreement. The Engli&s;h were &s;till too haughty to &s;toop
from the va&s;t hopes, which they had formerly entertained,
and to accept of terms more &s;uitable to the pre&s;ent con|dition
of the two kingdoms.</P>
<P>THE duke of York &s;oon after re&s;igned his govern|ment
to the earl of Warwic, a nobleman of reputa|tion,
whom death prevented from a long enjoyment of
his dignity. The duke, upon the demi&s;e of this noble|man,
returned to his charge, and during his admini&s;tra|tion
a truce was concluded between the King of England
and the duke of Burgundy, which had become nece&s;&s;ary
for the commercial intere&s;t of their &s;ubjects<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 573.</NOTE>. The war
with France continued in the &s;ame languid and feeble
&s;tate as before.</P>
<P>THE captivity of five princes of the blood, taken pri|&s;oners
in the battle of Azincour, was a con&s;iderable ad|vantage
which England long enjoyed above its enemy;
but this &s;uperiority was now entirely lo&s;t. Some of
the&s;e princes had died; &s;ome had been ran&s;omed for &s;ums
of money; and the duke of Orleans, the mo&s;t powerful
among them, was the la&s;t who remained in the hands of
<PB N="175" REF="187">
the Engli&s;h. He offered the &s;um of 54,000 nobles<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. x. p. 764. 776. 782. 795, 796. This &s;um was equal to 36,000 pounds &s;terling of our pre&s;ent money. A &s;ub&s;idy of a tenth and fifteenth was fixed by Edward III. at 29,000 pounds, that is 58,000 of our pre&s;ent money. The parliament granted only one &s;ub&s;idy during the cour&s;e of &s;even years, from 1437 to 1444.</NOTE> for
his liberty; and when this propo&s;al was laid before the
council of England, as every que&s;tion was there an ob|ject
of faction, the party of the duke of Gloce&s;ter, and
that of the cardinal of Winche&s;ter, were divided in their
&s;entiments with regard to it. The duke reminded the
council of the dying advice of the late King, that none
of the&s;e pri&s;oners &s;hould on any account be relea&s;ed, till
his &s;on was of &s;ufficient age to hold, him&s;elf, the
reins of government. The cardinal in&s;i&s;ted on the great|ne&s;s
of the &s;um proffered, which in reality was near
equal to two thirds of all the extraordinary &s;upplies, that
the parliament, during the cour&s;e of &s;even years, granted
for the &s;upport of the war. And he added, that the re|lea&s;e
of this prince was more likely to be advantageous
than prejudicial to the Engli&s;h intere&s;ts; by filling the
court of France with faction, and giving a head to tho&s;e
numerous malecontents, whom Charles was at pre&s;ent+able
with great difficulty to re&s;train. The cardinal's
party, as u&s;ual, prevailed: The duke of Orleans was
relea&s;ed, after a melancholy captivity of twenty-five
years<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 578.</NOTE>: And the duke of Burgundy, as a pledge of his
entire reconciliation with the family of Orleans, facili|tated
to that prince the payment of his ran&s;om. It mu&s;t
be confe&s;&s;ed, that the princes and nobility in tho&s;e ages,
went to war on very di&s;advantageous terms. If they were
taken pri&s;oners, they either remained in captivity during
life, or purcha&s;ed their liberty at the price which the

THE &s;entiments of the cardinal, &s;ome time after, pre|vailed
in another point of &s;till greater moment. That
prelate had always encouraged every propo&s;al of accom|modation
with France; and had repre&s;ented the utter
impo&s;&s;ibility, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, of pu&s;hing
farther the conque&s;ts in that kingdom, and the great dif|ficulty
of even maintaining tho&s;e which were already
made. He in&s;i&s;ted on the extreme reluctance of the
parliament to grant &s;upplies; the di&s;orders in which the
Engli&s;h affairs in Normandy were involved; the daily
progre&s;s made by the French King; and the advantage
of &s;topping his hand by a temporary accommodation,
which might leave room for time and accidents to ope|rate
in favour of the Engli&s;h. The duke of Gloce&s;ter,
high &s;pirited and haughty, and educated in the lofty pre|ten&s;ions,
which the fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es of his two brothers
had rendered familiar to him, could not yet be induced
to relinqui&s;h all hopes of prevailing over France; much
le&s;s, could he &s;ee with patience, his own opinion thwarted
and rejected by the influence of his rival in the Engli&s;h
council. But notwith&s;tanding his oppo&s;ition, the earl
of Suffolk, a nobleman who always adhered to the car|dinal's
party, was di&s;patched to Tours, in order to ne|gotiate
with the French mini&s;ters. It was found im|po&s;&s;ible
to adju&s;t the terms of a la&s;ting peace; but a truce
for twenty-two months was concluded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th May. Truce with France.</NOTE> which left every
thing on the pre&s;ent footing between the parties. The
numerous di&s;orders, under which the French government
laboured, and which time alone could remedy, induced
Charles to a&s;&s;ent to this truce; and the &s;ame motives
engaged him afterwards to prolong it<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Raymer, vol. ix. p. 101. 108. 206. 214.</NOTE>. But Suffolk,
not content with executing this object of his commi&s;&s;ion,
proceeded al&s;o to fini&s;h another bu&s;ine&s;s, which &s;eems
<PB N="177" REF="191">
rather to have been implied than included in the powers,
which had been granted him<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. p. 53.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN proportion as Henry advanced in years, his cha|racter
became fully known in the court, and was no
longer ambiguous to either faction. Of the mo&s;t harm|le&s;s,
inoffen&s;ive, &s;imple manners; but of the mo&s;t &s;lender
capacity; he was fitted, both by the &s;oftne&s;s of his tem|per,
and the weakne&s;s of his under&s;tanding, to be per|petually
governed by tho&s;e who &s;urrounded him; and it
was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that his reign would prove a perpe|tual
minority. As he had now reached the twenty-third
year of his age, it was natural to think of choo&s;ing him
a Queen; and each party was ambitious of having him
receive one from their hand; as it was probable, that this
circum&s;tance would decide forever the victory between
them. The duke of Gloce&s;ter propo&s;ed a daughter of
the count d'Armagnac; but had not credit to effectuate
his purpo&s;e. The cardinal and his friends had ca&s;t their
eye on Margaret of Anjou, daughter of Regnier, titular
King of Sicily, Naples, and Jeru&s;alem, de&s;cended from
the count of Anjou, brother of Charles V. who had left
the&s;e magnificent titles, but without any real power or
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, to his po&s;terity. This prince&s;s her&s;elf was
the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of her age both in body and mind;
and &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e qualities, which would
equally qualify her to acquire the a&s;cendant over Henry,
and to &s;upply all his defects and weakne&s;&s;es. Of a
ma&s;culine, courageous &s;pirit, of an enterprizing temper,
endowed with &s;olidity as well as vivacity of under&s;tand|ing,
&s;he had not been able to conceal the&s;e great talents
even in the privacy of her father's family; and it was
rea&s;onable to expect, that, when &s;he &s;hould mount the
throne, they would break out with &s;till &s;uperior lu&s;tre.
The earl of Suffolk, therefore, in concert with his a&s;&s;o|ciates
<PB N="178" REF="192">
of the Engli&s;h council, made propo&s;als of marriage
to Margaret, which were accepted. But this nobleman,
be&s;ides pre-occupying the prince&s;s's favour by being the
chief means of her advancement, endeavoured to ingra|tiate
him&s;elf with her and her family, by very extraor|dinary
conce&s;&s;ions: Tho' Margaret brought no dowry
with her,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the King with Mar|garet of Anjou.</NOTE> he ventured of him&s;elf, without any direct au|thority
from the council, but probably with the allowance
of the cardinal, and the ruling members, to engage by
a &s;ecret article, that the province of Maine, which was
at that time in the hands of the Engli&s;h, &s;hould be de|livered
up to Charles of Anjou her uncle<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 590.</NOTE>, who was
prime mini&s;ter and favourite of the French King, and who
had already received from his ma&s;ter the grant of that
province as his appanage.</P>
<P>THE treaty of marriage was ratified in England:
Suffolk obtained fir&s;t the title of marquis, then that of
duke; and even received the thanks of parliament, for
his &s;ervices in concluding it<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 630.</NOTE>. The prince&s;s fell imme|diately
into clo&s;e connexions with the cardinal and his
party, the dukes of Somer&s;et, Suffolk, and Buckingham<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 626.</NOTE>;
who, fortified by her powerful friend&s;hip, re&s;olved on the
final ruin of the duke of Gloce&s;ter.</P>
<P>THIS generous prince, wor&s;ted in all court intrigues,
for which his temper was not &s;uited, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1447.</NOTE> in a
high degree, the favour of the public, had already re|ceived
from his rivals a mo&s;t cruel mortification, which
he had hitherto born patiently, but which it was impo&s;|&s;ible,
that a per&s;on of his &s;pirit and humanity could ever
forgive. His dutche&s;s, the daughter of Reginald, lord
Cobham, had been accu&s;ed of the crime of witchcraft, and
it was pretended, that a waxen figure of the King was
<PB N="179" REF="193">
found in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which &s;he and her a&s;&s;ociates, Sir
Roger Bolingbroke a prie&s;t, and one Margery Jordan of
Eye, melted in a magical manner before a &s;low fire, with
an intention of making Henry's force and vigour wa&s;te
away, by like in&s;en&s;ible degrees. The accu&s;ation was
well calculated to affect the weak and credulous mind of
the King, and to gain belief in an ignorant age; and the
dutche&s;s was brought to trial with her confederates.
The nature of this crime, &s;o oppo&s;ite to all common
&s;en&s;e, &s;eems always to exempt the accu&s;ers from ob&s;erving
the rules of common &s;en&s;e in their evidence: The pri|&s;oners
were pronounced guilty; the dutche&s;s was con|demned
to do public penance, and to &s;uffer perpetual
impri&s;onment, and the others were executed<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 381. Holling&s;hed, p. 622. Grafton, p. 587.</NOTE>. But as
the&s;e violent proceedings were a&s;cribed &s;olely to the ma|lice
of the duke's enemies, the people, contrary to their
u&s;ual practice on &s;uch occa&s;ions, acquitted the unhappy
&s;ufferers; and encrea&s;ed their e&s;teem and affection to|wards
a prince, who was thus expo&s;ed, without protec|tion,
to &s;uch mortal injuries.</P>
<P>THESE &s;entiments of the public made the cardinal
of Winche&s;ter and his party &s;en&s;ible, that it was nece&s;&s;ary
to de&s;troy a man, who&s;e popularity might become dan|gerous,
and who&s;e re&s;entment they had &s;o much cau&s;e
to apprehend. In order to effectuate their purpo&s;e, a par|liament
was &s;ummoned to meet, not at London, which
was &s;uppo&s;ed to be too well affected to the duke, but at
St. Edmond&s;bury, where they expected that he would lie
entirely at mercy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th Feb. Murder of the duke of Gloce&s;ter.</NOTE> As &s;oon as he appeared, he was ac|cu&s;ed
of trea&s;on, and thrown into pri&s;on. He was &s;oon
after found dead in his bed<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 597.</NOTE>; and tho' it was pretended
that his death was natural, and tho' his body, which
<PB N="180" REF="194">
was expo&s;ed to public view, bore no marks of outward
injury, no one doubted that he had fallen a &s;acrifice to
the vengeance of his enemies. A trick, formerly practi&s;ed
on Edward II. on Richard II. and on Thomas of Wood|&s;tock,
duke of Gloce&s;ter, could deceive no body. The
rea&s;on of this violence &s;eems not, that the ruling party
apprehended his acquittal in parliament on account of his
innocence, which, in &s;uch times, was &s;eldom much re|garded;
but that they imagined his public trial and exe|cution
would have been more invidious than his private
murder, which they pretended to deny. Some gentlemen
of his retinue were afterwards tried for aiding him in his
trea&s;ons, and were condemned to be hanged, drawn and
quartered. They were hanged and cut down; but ju&s;t
as the executioner was proceeding to quarter them, their
pardon was produced, and they were recovered to life<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Fabian Chron. anno 1477.</NOTE>
The mo&s;t barbarous kind of mercy that can po&s;&s;ibly be
imagined!</P>
<P>THIS prince is &s;aid to have received a more learned
education than was u&s;ual in his age, to have founded one
of the fir&s;t public libraries in England, and to have been
a great patron of learned men. Among other advantages,
which he reaped from this turn of mind, it tended much,
to cure him of credulity; of which the following in|&s;tance
is given by Sir Thomas More. There was a man,
who pretended, that, tho' he was born blind, he had re|covered
his &s;ight by touching the &s;hrine of St. Albans.
The duke, happening &s;oon after to pa&s;s that way, que|&s;tioned
the man, and &s;eeming to doubt of his &s;ight, a&s;ked
him the colour of &s;everal cloaks, worn by per&s;ons in his
retinue. The man told him very readily. <HI>You are a
knave,</HI> cried the prince; <HI>had you been born blind, you could
not have di&s;tingui&s;hed colours:</HI> And immediately ordered
him to be put in the &s;tocks as an impo&s;tor<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 597.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="195">
THE cardinal of Winche&s;ter died fix weeks after his
nephew, who&s;e murder was univer&s;ally a&s;cribed to him
as well as to the duke of Suffolk, and which, it is &s;aid,
gave him more remor&s;e in his la&s;t moments, than could
naturally be expected from a man hardened, during the
cour&s;e of a long life, in fal&s;hood and in politics. What
&s;hare the Queen had in this guilt is uncertain; her u&s;ual
activity and &s;pirit made the public conclude with &s;ome
rea&s;on that the duke's enemies dur&s;t not have ventured
on &s;uch a deed without her privity. But there hap|pened
&s;oon after an event, of which &s;he and her favourite,
the duke of Suffolk, bore unconte&s;tibly the whole odium.</P>
<P>THAT article of the marriage treaty, by which the
province of Maine was to be yielded to Charles of An|jou,
the Queen's uncle, had probably been hitherto kept
a &s;ecret; and during the lifetime of the duke of Glo|ce&s;ter,
it would have been dangerous to venture on the
execution of it. But as the court of France in&s;i&s;ted &s;tre|nuou&s;ly
on performance, orders were now di&s;patched,
under Henry's hand, to Sir Francis Surienne, governor
of Mans, commanding him to &s;urrender that place to
Charles of Anjou. Surienne, either que&s;tioning the au|thenticity
of the order, or regarding his government as
his only fortune, refu&s;ed compliance; and it became ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for a French army, under the count de Dunois,
to lay &s;iege to the city. The governor made as good a
defence as his &s;ituation could permit; but receiving no
relief from Edmund duke of Somer&s;et, who was at that
time governor of Normandy, he was at la&s;t obliged to
capitulate, and to &s;urrender not only Mans, but all the
other fortre&s;&s;es of that province, which was thus en|tirely
alienated from the crown of England.</P>
<P>THE bad effects of this mea&s;ure &s;topped not here.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1448.</NOTE>
Surienne, at the head of all his garri&s;ons, amounting to
2500 men, retired into Normandy, in expectation of
<PB N="182" REF="196">
being taken into pay, and of being quartered in &s;ome
towns of that province. But Somer&s;et, who had no
means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting &s;uch a multitude, and who was pro|bably
incen&s;ed at Surienne's di&s;obedience, refu&s;ed to admit
him; and this adventurer, not daring to commit depre|dations
on the territories either of the King of France
or of England, marched into Brittany, &s;eized the town
of Fougeres, repaired the fortifications of Pontor&s;on and
St. James de Beuvron, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted his troops by the
ravages, which he committed on all that province<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. iii. p. 6.</NOTE>. The
duke of Brittany complained of this violence to the
King of France, his liege lord: Charles remon&s;trated
with the duke of Somer&s;et: That nobleman replied,
that the injury was done without his privity, and that
he had no authority over Surienne and his companions<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 7. Holling&s;hed, p. 629.</NOTE>.
Tho' this an&s;wer might appear very &s;atisfactory to Charles,
who had often felt &s;everely the licentious, independant
&s;pirit of &s;uch mercenary &s;oldiers, he never would admit
the apology. He &s;till in&s;i&s;ted, that the&s;e plunderers
&s;hould be recalled, and that reparation &s;hould be made
to the duke of Brittany for all the damages, which they
had committed: And in order to render an accommoda|tion
ab&s;olutely impracticable, he made the e&s;timation of
damages amount to no le&s;s a &s;um than 1,600,000 crowns.
He was &s;en&s;ible of the &s;uperiority, which the pre&s;ent
&s;tate of his affairs gave him over England; and he de|termined
to take advantage of it</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the truce concluded between the two<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE>
kingdoms, than Charles employed him&s;elf, with great
indu&s;try and judgment, in repairing tho&s;e numberle&s;s ills,
to which France, from the continuance of wars both
foreign and dome&s;tic, had &s;o long been expo&s;ed. He
re&s;tored the cour&s;e of public ju&s;tice; he introduced order
<PB N="183" REF="197">
into the finances; he e&s;tabli&s;hed di&s;cipline in his troops;
he repre&s;&s;ed faction in his court; he revived the languid
&s;tate of agriculture and the arts; and in the cour&s;e of a
few years, he rendered his kingdom flouri&s;hing within
it&s;elf, and formidable to all its neighbours. Meanwhile,
affairs in England had taken a very different turn. The
court was divided into parties, which were enraged
again&s;t each other: The people were di&s;contented with
the government: Conque&s;ts in France, which were an
object more of glory than of intere&s;t, were overlooked
amid&s;t dome&s;tic incidents, which engro&s;&s;ed all mens at|tention:
The governor of Normandy, ill &s;upplied with
money, was obliged to di&s;mi&s;s the greater part of his
troops, and to allow the fortifications of the towns and
ca&s;tles to fall into di&s;repair: And the nobility and people
of that province had, during the open communication
with France, enjoyed frequent opportunities of renewing
connexions with their antient ma&s;ter, and of concert|ing
the means for expelling the Engli&s;h.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1449.</NOTE> The occa&s;ion
therefore &s;eemed favourable to Charles for breaking the
truce;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Renewal of the war with France.</NOTE> and Normandy was at once invaded by four
powerful armies; one commanded by the King him&s;elf;
a &s;econd by the duke of Brittany; a third by the duke of
Alen&ccedil;on; and a fourth by the count de Dunois. The
places opened their gates almo&s;t as &s;oon as the French ap|peared
before them: Verne&uuml;il, Nogent, Chateau Gaillard,
Ponteau de mer, Gi&s;ors, Mant$, Vernon, Argentan,
Li&s;ieux, Fecamp, Coutances, Bele&s;me, Pont de l'Arche,
fell in an in&s;tant into the hands of the enemy: The duke
of Somer&s;et was &s;o far from having an army, which could
take the field, and relieve the&s;e places, that he was not
able to &s;upply them with the nece&s;&s;ary garri&s;ons and
provi&s;ions: He retired with the few troops, of which he
was ma&s;ter, into Ro&uuml;en; and thought it &s;ufficient, if,
till the arrival of &s;uccours from England, he could &s;ave
<PB N="184" REF="198">
that capital from the general ftate of the province. The
King of France, at the head of a formidable army, fifty
thou&s;and &s;trong, pre&s;ented him&s;elf before the gates:
The dangerous example of revolt had infected the inha|bitants,
and they called aloud for a capitulation. So|mer&s;et,
unable to re&s;i&s;t at once both the enemies within
and from without, retired with his garri&s;on into the pa|lace
and ca&s;tle; which, being places not tenable, he
was obliged to &s;urrender: He purcha&s;ed a retreat to Har|fleur
by the payment of 56,000 crowns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th Nov.</NOTE> by engaging to
&s;urrender Arques, Tancarville, Caudebec, Honfleur,
and other places in the higher Normandy, and by deli|vering
ho&s;tages for the performance of the&s;e articles<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol, iii. p. 21. Grafton, p. 643.</NOTE>.
The governor of Honfleur refu&s;ed to obey his orders;
upon which, the earl of Shrew&s;bury, who was one of
the ho&s;tages, was detained pri&s;oner; and the Engli&s;h
were thus deprived of the only general, capable of re|covering
them from their pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation.
Harfleur made a better defence under Sir Thomas Cur|&s;on,
the governor; but was finally obliged to open its
gates to the count de Dunois. Succours at la&s;t appeared
from England under Sir Thomas Kyriel, and landed
at Cherbourg: But the&s;e came very late, amounted only
to 4000 men, and were &s;oon after put to rout at Four|migni
by the count de Clermont<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 631.</NOTE>. This battle, or ra|ther
&s;kirmi&s;h, was the only action fought by the Eng|li&s;h
for the defence of their dominions in France, which
they had purcha&s;ed, at &s;uch an expence of blood and
trea&s;ure. Somer&s;et, &s;hut up in Ca&euml;n without any pro&s;pect
of relief, found it nece&s;&s;ary to capitulate: Falai&s;e opened
its gates, on condition that the earl of Shrew&s;bury
&s;hould be re&s;tored to liberty: And Cherbourg, the la&s;t
place of Normandy, which remained in the hands of the
<PB N="185" REF="199">
Engli&s;h, being delivered up, the conque&s;t of that im|portant
province was fini&s;hed in a twelvemonth by
Charles, to the infinite joy of the inhabitants and of
his whole kingdom<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 646.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A LIKE rapid &s;ucce&s;s attended the French arms in
Guienne; tho' the inhabitants of that province were,
from long cu&s;tom, better inclined to the Eng|li&s;h go|vernment.
The count de Dunois was di&s;patched thi|ther,
and met with no re&s;i&s;tance in the field, and very
little from the towns. Great improvements had been
made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Eng|li&s;h expel|led France.</NOTE> during this age, in the &s;tructure and management
of artillery, and none in fortification; and the art of
defence was by that means more unequal, than either
before or &s;ince, to the art of attack. After all the &s;mall
places about Bourdeaux were reduced, that city agreed
to &s;ubmit, if not relieved by a certain time; and as no
one in England thought &s;eriou&s;ly of the&s;e di&s;tant con|cerns,
no relief appeared; the place &s;urrendered; and
Bayonne being taken &s;oon after, this whole province,
which had remained united to England, &s;ince the acce&s;|&s;ion
of Henry II. was, after a period of three centuries,
finally &s;wallowed up by the French monarchy.</P>
<P>THO' no peace nor truce was concluded between
France and England, the war was in a manner at an
end. The Engli&s;h, torn in pieces by the civil di&s;&s;en|&s;ions
which en&s;ued, made but one feeble effort more
for the recovery of Guienne: And Charles, occupied
at home, in regulating the government, and fencing
again&s;t the intrigues of his factious &s;on, Lewis the Dau|phin,
&s;carce ever attempted to invade them in their i&s;land,
or to retaliate upon them, by availing him&s;elf of their
inte&s;tine confu&s;ions.</P>

had never failed, however gentle and innocent,
to be infe&s;ted with faction, di&s;content, rebellion, and
civil commotions; and as the incapacity of Henry ap|peared
every day in a fuller light, the&s;e dangerous con|&s;equences began, from pa&s;t experience, to be univer&s;ally
and ju&s;tly apprehended. Men al&s;o of unquiet &s;pirits, no

cau&s;es alone were &s;ufficient to breed confu&s;ion, there con|curred
another circum&s;tance of the mo&s;t dangerous na|ture:
A pretender to the crown appeared. The title it&s;elf
<PB N="187" REF="201">
of the weak prince, who enjoyed the name of &s;overeignty,

but Anne, the &s;i&s;ter of the la&s;t earl of Marche,
having e&s;pou&s;ed the earl of Cambridge, beheaded in the

&s;on of Edward III. &s;tood plainly in the order of &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
before the King, who derived his de&s;cent from the
duke of Lanca&s;ter, third &s;on of that monarch; and that
claim could not, in many re&s;pects, have fallen into more
dangerous hands than tho&s;e of the duke of York.
Richard was a man of valour and abilities, of a prudent
conduct and mild di&s;po&s;itions: He had enjoyed an op|portunity
of di&s;playing the&s;e virtues in his government
of France: And tho' recalled from that command by
the intrigues and &s;uperior intere&s;t of the duke of Somer|&s;et,
he had been &s;ent to &s;uppre&s;s a rebellion in Ireland;
had &s;ucceeded, much better in that enterprize than his
rival in the defence of Normandy; and had even been
able to attach to his per&s;on and family, the whole Iri&s;h
nation, whom he was &s;ent to &s;ubdue<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 387.</NOTE> In the right of
his father, he bore the rank of fir&s;t prince of the blood;
and by this &s;tation, he gave a lu&s;tre to his title derived
from the family of Mortimer, which, tho' of great no|bility,
was equaled by other families in the kingdom,
and had been eclip&s;ed by the royal de&s;cent of the hou&s;e
<PB N="188" REF="202">
of Lanca&s;ter. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an immen&s;e fortune from the
union of &s;o many &s;ucce&s;&s;ions, tho&s;e of Cambridge and
York on the one hand, with tho&s;e of Mortimer on the
other: Which la&s;t inheritance had before been augmented
by an union of the e&s;tates of Clarence and Ul&s;ter, with
the patrimonial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the family of Marche. The
alliances too of Richard, in marrying the daughter of
Ralph Nevil, earl of We&s;tmoreland, had very widely
extended his intere&s;t among the nobility, and had pro|cured
him many connexions in that formidable order.</P>
<P>THE family of Nevil was perhaps at this time the mo&s;t
potent, both from their opulent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and from the
characters of the men, that has ever appeared in Eng|land.
For be&s;ides the earl of Westmoreland, the lords
Latimer, Fauconbridge, and Abergavenny; the earls
of Sali&s;bury and Warwic were of that family, and were
of them&s;elves, on many accounts, the greate&s;t noblemen
of the kingdom. The earl of Sali&s;bury, brother-in-law
to the duke of York, was the elde&s;t &s;on by a &s;econd
marriage of the earl of We&s;tmoreland; and inherited by
his wife, daughter and heir of Montacute, earl of Sa|li&s;bury,
killed before Orleans, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and title of
that great family. His elde&s;t: &s;on, Richard, had married
Anne, the daughter and heir of Beauchamp, earl of
Warwic, who died governor of France; and by that
alliance he enjoyed the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and had acquired the
title of that other family, one of the mo&s;t opulent, mo&s;t
antient,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The earl of Warwic.</NOTE> and mo&s;t illu&s;trious of the kingdom. The per|&s;onal
qualities al&s;o of the&s;e two earls, e&s;pecially of War|wic,
enhanced the &s;plendor of their nobility, and en|crea&s;ed
their influence over the people. This latter
nobleman, commonly known, from the &s;ub&s;equent
events, by the appellation of the <HI>King-maker,</HI> had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
him&s;elf, by his gallantry in the field, by the ho&s;pi|tality
of his table, by the magnificence, and &s;till more
<PB N="189" REF="203">
by the genero&s;ity of his expence, and by the &s;pirited and
bold manner, which attended him in all his actions.
The unde&s;igning frankne&s;s and openne&s;s of his character
rendered his conque&s;t over men's affections the more cer|tain
and infallible: His pre&s;ents were regarded as $ure
te&s;timonies of e&s;teem and friend&s;hip; and his profe&s;&s;ions
as the overflowings of his genuine &s;entiments. No le&s;s
than 30,000 people are &s;aid to have daily lived at his
board in the different manors and ca&s;tles which he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
in England: The military men, allured by his
munificence and ho&s;pitality, as well as by his bravery,
were zealou&s;ly attached to his intere&s;ts: The people in
general bore him an unlimited affection: His numerous
retainers were more devoted to his will, than to the
prince or to the laws: And he was the greate&s;t, as well
as the la&s;t, of tho&s;e mighty barons, who formerly over|awed
the crown, and rendered the people incapable of
any regular &s;y&s;tem of civil government.</P>
<P>BUT the duke of York, be&s;ides the family of Nevil,
had many other partizans among the great nobility.
Courtney, earl of Devon&s;hire, de&s;cended from the royal
blood of France, was attached to his intere&s;ts: Mou|bray,
duke of Norfolk, from his hereditary hatred to the
family of Lanca&s;ter, had embraced the &s;ame party: And
the discontents, which univer&s;ally prevailed among the
people, rendered every combination of the great the more
dangerous to the e&s;tabli&s;hed government.</P>
<P>THO' the people were never willing to grant the
&s;upplies nece&s;&s;ary for keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the conquered
provinces in France, they repined extremely at the lo&s;s
of the&s;e boa&s;ted acqui&s;itions; and fancied, becau&s;e a &s;ud|den
irruption could make conque&s;ts, that, without &s;teady
coun&s;els and an uniform expence, it was po&s;&s;ible to main|tain
them. The voluntary ce&s;&s;ion of Maine to the queen's uncle,
had made them &s;u&s;pect treachery in the lo&s;s of
<PB N="190" REF="204">
Normandy and Guienne. They &s;till con&s;idered Mar|garet
as a French woman and a latent enemy of the
kingdom. And when they &s;aw her father and all her
relations active in promoting the &s;ucce&s;&s; of the French,
they could not be per&s;uaded, that &s;he, who was all
powerful in the Engli&s;h council, would very zealou&s;ly
oppo&s;e them in their enterprizes.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t fatal blow, which was given to the po|polarity
of the crown and to the intere&s;ts of the hou&s;e
of Lanca&s;ter, was by the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the virtuous
duke of Gloce&s;ter, who&s;e character, had he been alive,
would have kept in awe the partizans of York, but
who&s;e memory, being extremely cheri&s;hed by the people,
&s;erved to throw an infinite odium on all his murderers.
By this event, the reigning family &s;uffered a double pre|judice:
It was deprived of its firme&s;t &s;upport; and it was
loaded with all the infamy of that imprudent and bar|barous
execution.</P>
<P>AS the duke of Suffolk was known to have had an
active hand in this crime, he partook deeply of the ha|tred,
which attended it; and the clamours, which nece&s;|&s;arily
ro&s;e again&s;t him, as prime mini&s;ter and declared fa|vourite
of the queen, were thereby augmented to a ten|fold
pitch, and became ab&s;olutely uncontroleable. The
great nobility could ill brook to &s;ee a &s;ubject exalted
above them; much more one who was only great grand|&s;on
to a merchant, and who was of a birth &s;o much in|ferior
to theirs. The people complained of his arbitrary
mea&s;ures; which were, in &s;ome degree, a nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence
of the irregular power then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the
prince, but which the lea&s;t di&s;affection ea&s;ily magnified
into tyranny. The immen&s;e acqui&s;itions, which he daily
made, were the object of envy; and as they were made
at the expence of the crown, which was it&s;elf reduced
to the mo&s;t &s;candalous poverty, they appeared on that
<PB N="191" REF="205">
account, to all indifferent per&s;ons, the more exception|able
and invidious.</P>
<P>THE revenues of the crown, which had long been
di&s;proportioned to its power and dignity, had been ex|tremely
dilapidated during the minority of Henry<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 609.</NOTE>;
both by the rapacity of the courtiers, which the King's
uncles could not controul, and by the nece&s;&s;ary expences
of the French war, which had always been &s;o ill &s;upplied
by the grants of parliament. The royal deme&s;nes were di&s;|&s;ipated,
and at the &s;ame time the King was loaded with
a debt of 372,000 pounds, a &s;um &s;o immen&s;e, that the
parliament could never think of di&s;charging it. This un|happy
&s;ituation forced the mini&s;ters upon many arbitrary
mea&s;ures: The hou&s;ehold it&s;elf could not be &s;upported
without &s;tretching to the utmo&s;t the right of purveyance,
and rendering it a kind of univer&s;al robbery upon the
people: The public clamour ro&s;e high upon this occa|&s;ion,
and no one had the equity to make allowance for
the nece&s;&s;ity of the King's &s;ituation. Suffolk, once be|come
odious, bore the blame of the whole; and every
grievance in every part of the administration was uni|ver&s;ally
imputed to his tyranny and inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THIS nobleman, &s;en&s;ible of the public hatred under
which he laboured,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Impeach|ment of the duke of Suffolk.</NOTE> and fore&s;eeing an attack from the
commons, endeavoured to overawe his enemies, by boldly
pre&s;enting him&s;elf to the charge, and by in&s;i&s;ting upon
his own innocence, and even upon his merits and tho&s;e of
his family in the public &s;ervice. He ro&s;e up in the hou&s;e
of peers; took notice of the clamours propagated again&s;t
him; and complained, that, after &s;erving the crown in
thirty-four campaigns, after &s;taying abroad &s;eventeen
years without once returning to his own country; after
lo&s;ing a father and three brothers in the wars with France;
<PB N="192" REF="206">
after being him&s;elf a pri&s;oner, and purchasing his liberty
by a large ran&s;om; it &s;hould yet be &s;u&s;pected, that he
had been debauched from his allegiance by that enemy
whom he had ever oppo&s;ed with &s;uch zeal and fortitude,
and that he had betrayed his prince, who had rewarded
his &s;ervices by the highe&s;t honours and greate&s;t offices,
which it was in his power to confer<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 641.</NOTE>. This &s;peech did
not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e intended. The commons, rather
the more provoked at his challenge, opened their charge
again&s;t Suffolk, and &s;ent up to the hou&s;e of peers an ac|cu&s;ation
of high trea&s;on, divided into &s;everal articles.
They in&s;i&s;ted, that he had per&s;uaded the French King
to invade England with an armed force, in order to
depo&s;e the King, to place on the throne his own &s;on,
John de la Pole, whom he intended to marry to Mar|garet,
the only daughter of the late John, duke of So|mer&s;et,
and to whom, he imagined, he would by that
means acquire a title to the crown: That he had con|tributed
to the relea&s;e of the duke of Orleans, in hopes,
that that prince would aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t King Charles in
expelling the Engli&s;h from France, and recovering full
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his kingdom: That he had afterwards en|couraged
that King to make open war on Normandy
and Guienne, and had promoted his conque&s;ts by betray|ing
the &s;ecrets of England, and ob&s;tructing the &s;uccours
propo&s;ed to be &s;ent over to tho&s;e provinces: And that he
had, without any powers or commi&s;&s;ion, promi&s;ed by
treaty to deliver up the province of Maine to Charles of
Anjou, and had accordingly delivered it up; a conce&s;&s;ion,
which proved in the i&s;&s;ue the chief cau&s;e of the lo&s;s of
Normandy<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 642. Hall, fol. 157. Holing&s;hed, p. 631. Grafton, p. 607.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="207">
IT is evident, from a review of the&s;e articles, that the
commons adopted without enquiry all the popular cla|mours
again&s;t the duke of Suffolk, and charged him with
crimes, of which none but the vulgar could &s;eriou&s;ly
believe him guilty. Nothing can be more incredible,
than that a nobleman of his rank and character could
think of acquiring the crown to his family, and of de|po&s;ing
Henry by foreign force, and together with him,
Margaret, his patron, a prince&s;s of &s;o much &s;pirit and
penetration. Suffolk appealed to many noblemen in the
hou&s;e, who knew, that he had intended to marry his &s;on
to one of the co-heirs of the earl of Warwic, and was
di&s;appointed in his de&s;ign only by the death of that lady:
And he ob&s;erved, that Margaret of Somerset could bring
to her hu&s;band no title to the crown; becau&s;e &s;he her|&s;elf
was not &s;o much as comprehended in the entail,
&s;ettled by act of parliament. It is ea&s;y to account for
the lo&s;s of Normandy and Guienne from the &s;ituation
of affairs in the two kingdoms, without &s;uppo&s;ing any
treachery in the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters; and it may &s;afely
be affirmed, that greater vigour of council was requi&s;ite to
defend them from the arms of Charles VII. than to con|quer
them at fir&s;t from his predece&s;&s;or. It could never
be the intere&s;t of any Engli&s;h mini&s;ter to betray and
abandon the&s;e provinces; much le&s;s of one, who was
&s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed in his ma&s;ter's favour, who enjoyed
&s;uch high honours and ample po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in his own
country, who had nothing to dread but the effects of po|pular
hatred, and who could never think, without the
mo&s;t extreme reluctance, of becoming a fugitive and
exile in a foreign land. The only article, which car|ries
any face of probability, is his engagement for the
delivery of Maine to Charles of Anjou; but Suffolk
maintained, with great appearance of truth, that this
mea&s;ure was known and consented to by &s;everal at the
<PB N="194" REF="208">
council board<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 643.</NOTE>; and it &s;eems hard to a&s;cribe to it, as
is done by the parliament, the &s;ub&s;equent lo&s;s of Nor|mandy
and expul&s;ion of the Engli&s;h. Normandy lay
open on every &s;ide to the inva&s;ion of the French: Maine,
an inland province, mu&s;t &s;oon after have fallen without
any attack: And as the Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in other parts
more fortre&s;&s;es than they could garri&s;on or provide for,
it &s;eemed no bad policy to contract their force, and to
render the defence practicable, by reducing it into
&s;maller compa&s;s.</P>
<P>THE commons were probably &s;en&s;ible, that this charge
of trea&s;on again&s;t Suffolk would not bear a &s;trict &s;crutiny;
and they therefore &s;ent up, &s;oon after, a new charge of
mi&s;demeanors, which they al&s;o divided into &s;everal ar|ticles.
They affirmed, among other imputations, that
he had procured exorbitant grants from the crown, had
embezzled the public money, had conferred offices on
improper per&s;ons, had perverted ju&s;tice by maintaining
iniquitous cau&s;es, and had procured pardons to notorious
offenders<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 643.</NOTE>. The articles are mo&s;tly general; but are
not improbable: And as Suffolk &s;eems to have been a
bad man and a bad mini&s;ter, it will not be ra&s;h in us
to think, that he was guilty, and that many of the&s;e
articles could have been proved again&s;t him. The court
was alarmed at the pro&s;ecution of a favourite mini&s;ter,
who lay under &s;uch a load of popular prejudices; and an
expedient was fallen upon to &s;ave him from pre&s;ent ruin.
The King &s;ent for all the lords, &s;piritual and temporal,
to his apartment: The pri&s;oner was produced before
them, and a&s;ked what he could &s;ay in his own defence:
He denied the charge; but &s;ubmitted to the King's
mercy: Henry expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf not to be &s;atisfied with
regard to the fir&s;t bill of trea&s;ons; but in con&s;ideration of
the &s;econd of mi&s;demeanors, he declared, that, by virtue
<PB N="195" REF="209">
of Suffolk's own &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, not by any judicial autho|rity,
he bani&s;hed him the kingdom, during five years.
The lords remained &s;ilent; but &s;o &s;oon as they returned
to their own hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His bani&s;h|ment,</NOTE> they entered a prote&s;t, that this
&s;entence &s;hould nowi&s;e infringe their privileges, and that
if Suffolk had in&s;i&s;ted upon his right, and had not &s;ub|mitted
voluntarily to the King's orders, he was intitled
to a trial by his peers in parliament.</P>
<P>IT was ea&s;y to &s;ee, that the&s;e irregular proceedings
were meant to favour Suffolk, and that, as he &s;till po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
the Queen's confidence, he would, on the fir&s;t fa|vourable
opportunity, be re&s;tored to his country, and be
re-in&s;tated in his former power and credit. A captain of
a ve&s;&s;el was therefore employed by his enemies to inter|cept
him in his pa&s;&s;age to France: He was &s;eized near
Dover;<NOTE PLACE="marg">and death.</NOTE> his head &s;truck off on the &s;ide of a long boat,
and his body thrown into the &s;ea<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 158. Hi&s;t. Croyland. contin. p. 525. Stowe, p. 388. Grafton, p. 610.</NOTE>. No enquiry was
made after the authors and accomplices of this atrocious
act of violence.</P>
<P>THE duke of Somer&s;et &s;ucceeded to Suffolk's power in
the mini&s;try, and credit with the Queen; and as he was the
per&s;on, in who&s;e hands the French provinces were lo&s;t,
the public, who judge always by the event, &s;oon made
him equally the object of their animo&s;ity and hatred.
The duke of York was ab&s;ent in Ireland during all the&s;e
tran&s;actions; and however it might be &s;u&s;pected, that
his partizans had excited and &s;upported the pro&s;ecution
of Suffolk, no immediate ground of complaint could, on
that account, lie again&s;t him. But there happened &s;oon
after an incident, which rouzed the jealou&s;y of the court,
and di&s;covered to them the extreme danger, to which
<PB N="196" REF="210">
they were expo&s;ed from the preten&s;ions of that wi&s;e and
popular prince.</P>
<P>THE humours of the people, &s;et afloat by the
parliamentary impeachment, and by the fall of &s;o great
a favourite as Suffolk, broke out in various commo|tions,
which were &s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;ed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Popular in|&s;urrection.</NOTE> but there aro&s;e one
in Kent, which was likely to have been attended with
more dangerous con&s;equences. A man of low condi|tion,
one John Cade, a native of Ireland, who had been
obliged to fly into France for his crimes, ob&s;erved on his
return the di&s;contents of the people; and he laid on them
the foundation of projects, which were at fir&s;t attended
with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s. Me took the name of John Mor|timer,
intending, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, to pa&s;s him&s;elf for a
&s;on of that Sir John Mortimer, who had been &s;entenced
to death by parliament, and executed in the begin|ning
of this reign, without any trial or evidence,
merely upon an indictment of high trea&s;on, given in
again&s;t him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 364. Cotton, p. 564. This author admires, that &s;uch a piece of inju&s;tice &s;hould have been committed in peaceable times: He might have added, and by &s;uch virtuous princes as Bedford and Gloce&s;ter. But it is to be pre&s;umed, that Mortimer was guilty; tho' his condemnation was highly irregular and illegal. The people had at this time a very feeble &s;en&s;e of law and a con&s;titution; and power was
very imperfectly re&s;trained by the&s;e limits. When the proceedings of a parliament were &s;o irregular, it is ea&s;y to imagine, that tho&s;e of a king would be more &s;o.</NOTE>. On the fir&s;t mention of that popular
name, the common people of Kent, to the number of
20,000, flocked to Cade's &s;tandard; and he excited
their zeal, by publishing complaints again&s;t the nume|rous
abu&s;es of government, and demanding redre&s;s of
their grievances. The court, not yet fully &s;en&s;ible of
the danger, &s;ent a &s;mall force again&s;t the rioters, under
the command of Sir Humphrey Stafford, who was de|feated
<PB N="197" REF="211">
and &s;lain in an action near Sevenoke<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 159. Holing&s;hed, p. 634.</NOTE>; and Cade,
advancing with his followers towards London, encamped
on Black-heath. Tho' elated by his victory, he &s;till
maintained the appearance of moderation; and &s;ending
the court a very plau&s;ible li&s;t of grievances<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 388, 389. Holing&s;hed, p. 633.</NOTE>, he pro|mi&s;ed,
that when the&s;e were redre&s;&s;ed, and when lord
Say, the trea&s;urer, and Cromer, high &s;heriff of Kent,
were puni&s;hed for their malver&s;ations, he would imme|diately
lay down his arms. The council, who ob&s;erved,
that nobody was willing to fight again&s;t men &s;o rea&s;on|able
in their preten&s;ions, carried the King, for pre&s;ent
&s;afety, to Kenilworth; and the city immediately opened
their gates to Cade, who maintained, during &s;ome time,
great order and di&s;cipline among his followers. He al|ways
led them out into the fields during the night-time;
and publi&s;hed &s;evere edicts again&s;t plunder and violence of
every kind: But being obliged, in order to gratify their
malevolence again&s;t Say and Cromer, to put the&s;e mi|ni&s;ters
to death without a legal trial<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 612.</NOTE>; he found, that,
after the commi&s;&s;ion of this crime, he was no longer
ma&s;ter of their riotous di&s;po&s;ition, and that all his orders
were neglected<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 160.</NOTE>. They broke into a rich hou&s;e, which
they plundered; and the citizens, alarmed with this act
of violence, &s;hut their gates again&s;t them, and being
&s;econded by a detachment of &s;oldiers, &s;ent them by lord
Scales, governor of the tower, they repul&s;ed the rebels
with great &s;laughter<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Croyl. contin. p. 526.</NOTE>. The Kenti&s;hmen were &s;o di&s;|couraged
with this blow, that, upon receiving a general
pardon from the primate then chancellor, they retreated
towards Roche&s;ter, and then di&s;per&s;ed. The pardon
was &s;oon after annulled, as being extorted by violence:
A price was &s;et on Cade's head<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. p. 275.</NOTE>, who was killed by one
<PB N="198" REF="212">
Iden, a gentleman of Su&s;&s;ex; and many of his followers
were capitally puni&s;hed for their rebellion.</P>
<P>IT was imagined by the court, that the duke of York
had &s;ecretly in&s;tigated Cade to this attempt, in order to
make an experiment of the di&s;po&s;itions of the people
towards his title and family<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 661. Stowe, p, 391.</NOTE>: And as the trial had &s;uc|ceeded
to his wi&s;h, the ruling party had greater rea&s;on
than ever to apprehend the future con&s;equences of his
preten&s;ions. At the &s;ame time, they heard that he in|tended
to return from Ireland; and fearing, that he meant

day more and more the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation: The
minds of men were in&s;en&s;ibly &s;harpened again&s;t each

extremities: And various topics were pleaded in &s;upport
of the preten&s;ions of each party.</P>

that tho' the exaltation of Henry IV. might at fir&s;t be
deemed &s;omewhat irregular, and could not be ju&s;tified
<PB N="199" REF="213">
by any of tho&s;e principles, on which that prince cho&s;e
to re&s;t his title, it was yet founded on general con&s;ent,
was a national act, and was derived from the voluntary
approbation of a free people, who, being loo&s;ened from
their allegiance by the tyranny of the preceding govern|ment,
were moved by gratitude, as well as by a &s;en&s;e of
public intere&s;t, to commit the &s;ceptre into the hands of their
deliverer: That even if that e&s;tabli&s;hment were allowed
to be at fir&s;t invalid, it had acquired &s;olidity by time, the
only principle which ultimately gives authority to go|vernment,
and removes tho&s;e &s;cruples, which the ire|gular
&s;teps, attending almo&s;t all revolutions, naturally
excite in the minds of the people: That the right of
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion was a rule admitted only for general good, and
for the maintenance of public order; and could never
be pleaded to the overthrow of national tranquillity, and
the &s;ubver&s;ion of regular e&s;tabli&s;hments: That the prin|ciples
of liberty, no le&s;s than the maxims of internal
peace, were injured by the&s;e preten&s;ions of the hou&s;e of
York; and if &s;o many re-iterated acts of the legi&s;lature,
by which the crown was entailed on the pre&s;ent family,
were now invalidated, the Engli&s;h nation mu&s;t be con|&s;idered,
not as a free people who could di&s;po&s;e of their
own government, but as a troop of &s;laves, who were
implicitly tran&s;mitted by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from one hand to an|other:
That the nation was bound to allegiance under
the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter by moral, no le&s;s than by
political duty; and were they to infringe tho&s;e numerous
oaths of fealty, which they had &s;worn to Henry and his
predece&s;&s;ors, they would thenceforth be &s;o thrown loo&s;e
from all principles, that it would be found difficult ever
after to fix and re&s;train them: That the duke of York
him&s;elf had frequently done homage to the King as his
lawful &s;overeign, and had thereby, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn
manner, made an indirect renunciation of tho&s;e claims,
<PB N="200" REF="214">
with which he now dared to di&s;turb the tranquillity of the
public: That even tho' the violation of the rights of
blood, made on the depo&s;ition of Richard, was perhaps
ra&s;h and imprudent, it was now too late to remedy the
mi&s;chief; the danger of a di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion could no
longer be obviated; the people, accu&s;tomed to a govern|ment,
which, in the hands of the late King, had been
&s;o glorious, and in that of his predece&s;&s;or, &s;o prudent
and &s;alutary, would &s;till a&s;cribe a right to it; by cau&s;ing
multiplied di&s;orders, and by &s;hedding an inundation of
blood, the advantage would only be obtained, of exchang|ing
one pretender for another; and the hou&s;e of York
it&s;elf, if e&s;tabli&s;hed on the throne, would, on the fir&s;t
opportunity, be expo&s;ed to tho&s;e revolutions, which the
giddy spirit, excited in the people, gave &s;o much rea&s;on
to apprehend: And that tho' the pre&s;ent King enjoyed not
the &s;hining talents, which had appeared in his father and
grandfather, he might &s;till have a &s;on, who &s;hould be
endowed with them; he was him&s;elf eminent for the
mo&s;t harmle&s;s and inoffen&s;ive manners; and if active
princes were dethroned on pretence of tyranny, and in|dolent
ones on the plea of incapacity, there would thence|forth
remain in the constitution no &s;ettled and e&s;tabli&s;hed
rule of obedience to any &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THESE &s;trong topics in favour of the hou&s;e of Lan|ca&s;ter,
were oppo&s;ed by arguments no le&s;s convincing
on the &s;ide of the hou&s;e of York. The partizans of this
latter family a&s;&s;erted, that the maintenance of order in
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of princes, &s;o far from incroaching on the
rights of the people, or invalidating their fundamental
title to good government, was e&s;tabli&s;hed only for the
purpo&s;es of government, and &s;erved to prevent tho&s;e
numberle&s;s confu&s;ions, which mu&s;t en&s;ue, if no rule was
followed but the uncertain and di&s;puted views of pre&s;ent
convenience and advantage: That the &s;ame maxims,
<PB N="201" REF="215">
which en&s;ured the public peace, were al&s;o &s;alutary to
national liberty; the privileges of the people could only
be maintained by the ob&s;ervance of laws; and if no
account was made of the rights of the &s;overeign, it could
le&s;s be expected, that any regard would be paid to the
property and freedom of the &s;ubject: That it was never
too late to correct any pernicious precedent; an unju&s;t
e&s;tabli&s;hment, the longer it &s;tood, acquired the greater
&s;anction and validity; it could, with more appearance
of rea&s;on, be pleaded as an authority for a like inju&s;tice;
and the maintenance of it, in&s;tead of favouring public
tranquillity, tended to disjoint every principle by which
human &s;ociety was &s;upported: That u&s;urpers would be
happy, if their pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power, or their con|tinuance
for a few years, could convert them into legal
princes; but nothing would be more mi&s;erable than the
people, if all re&s;traints on violence and ambition were
thus removed, and a full &s;cope given to the attempts of
every turbulent innovator: That time indeed be&s;towed
a &s;olidity on government, who&s;e fir&s;t foundation was the
mo&s;t infirm; but it required a long cour&s;e of time to
operate this effect, and the total extinction of tho&s;e clai|mants,
who&s;e title was built on the original principles
of the con&s;titution: That the depo&s;ition of Richard, and
the advancement of Henry IV. were not deliberate na|tional
acts; but the re&s;ult of the levity and violence of
the people, and proceeded from tho&s;e very defects in hu|man
nature, which the e&s;tabli&s;hment of political &s;ociety,
and of an order in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, was calculated to prevent:
That the &s;ub&s;equent entails of the crown were a con|tinuance
of the &s;ame violence and u&s;urpation; they were
not ratified by the legi&s;lature, &s;ince the con&s;ent of the
rightful King was &s;till wanting; and the acquie&s;cence,
fir&s;t of the family of Mortimer, then of the family of
York, proceeded from pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity, and implied no
renunciation of their preten&s;ions: That the re&s;toration
<PB N="202" REF="216">
of that order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, could not be con&s;idered as a
changes, which familiarized the people to revolutions; but
as a correction of former changes, which had it&s;elf en|couraged
the giddy &s;pirit of innovation, rebellion, and
di&s;obedience: And that as the original title of Lanca&s;ter
&s;tood only, in the per&s;on of Henry IV. on pre&s;ent con|venience,
even this principle, unju&s;tifiable as it was, when
not &s;upported by laws, and warranted by the con&s;titution,
had now entirely gone over to the other &s;ide; nor was
there any compari&s;on between a prince utterly unable to
&s;way the &s;cepter, and governed entirely by corrupt mini|&s;ters,
or by an imperious Queen, engaged in foreign and
ho&s;tile intere&s;ts; and a prince of mature years, of ap|proved
wi&s;dom and experience, a native of England, the
lineal heir of the crown, who by his re&s;toration would
replace every thing on their antient foundations.</P>
<P>So many plau&s;ible arguments could be urged on both
&s;ides of this intere&s;ting que&s;tion, that the people were
extremely divided in their &s;entiments; and tho' the
noblemen of greate&s;t power and influence &s;eem to have
embraced the party of York, the oppo&s;ite cau&s;e had the
advantage of being &s;upported by the pre&s;ent laws, and
by the immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of royal authority. There
were al&s;o many great noblemen of the Lanca&s;trian party,
who balanced the power of their antagonists; and kept
the nation in &s;u&s;pence between them. The earl of
Northumberland adhered to the pre&s;ent government:
The earl of We&s;tmoreland, in &s;pite of his connections
with the duke of York, and with the family of Nevil,
of which he was the head, was brought over to the
&s;ame party; and the whole north of England, the mo&s;t
warlike part of the kingdom, was, by means of the&s;e
two potent noblemen, engaged warmly in the intere&s;ts
of Lanca&s;ter. Edmund Beau$ort, duke of Somer&s;et,
and his brother Henry, were great &s;upports of that
cau&s;e; as were al&s;o Henry Holland, duke of Exeter,
<PB N="203" REF="217">
Stafford, duke of Buckingham, the earl of Shrew&s;bury,
the lords Clifford, Dudley, Scales, Audley, and other
noblemen.</P>
<P>WHILE the kingdom was in this &s;ituation, it might
naturally be expected, that &s;o many turbulent barons,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of co much independant authority, would im|mediately
have flown to arms, and have decided the quar|rel,
after their u&s;ual manner, by war and battle, under
the &s;tandard of the contending princes. But there were
&s;till many cau&s;es, which retarded the&s;e de&s;perate extremi|ties,
and made a long train of faction, intrigue and ca|bal,
precede the military operations. By the gradual
progre&s;s of arts in England, as well as in other parts of Eu|rope,
the people were now become of &s;ome con&s;equence;
laws were beginning to be re&s;pected by them; and it
was requi&s;ite, by various pretences, previou&s;ly to recon|cile
their minds to the overthrow of &s;uch an antient e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
as that of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, ere their
concurrence could rea&s;onably be expected. The duke
of York him&s;elf, the new claimant, was of a very mo|derate
and cautious character, an enemy to violence,
and inclined to tru&s;t rather to time and policy, than to
&s;anguinary mea&s;ures, for the &s;ucce&s;s of his preten&s;ions.
The very imbecillity it&s;elf of Henry tended to keep the
factions in &s;u&s;pence, and make them &s;tand long in awe
of each other: It rendered the Lanca&s;trian party unable
to &s;trike any violent blow again&s;t their enemies; it en|couraged
the Yorki&s;ts to hope, that, after bani&s;hing the
King's mini&s;ters, and getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his per&s;on,
they might gradually undermine his authority, and be
able, without the perilous experiment of a civil war,
to change the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by parliamentary and legal au|thority.</P>
<P>THE di&s;po&s;ition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1451.</NOTE> which appeared in a parliament, a&s;&s;em|bled
&s;oon after the arrival of the duke of York from Ireland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th Nov.</NOTE>
<PB N="204" REF="218">
favoured the&s;e expectations, and both di&s;covered an unu&s;ual
boldne&s;s in the commons, and were a proof of the gene|ral
di&s;contents which prevailed again&s;t the admini&s;tration.
The lower hou&s;e, without any previous enquiry or exa|mination,
without alledging any other cau&s;e than common
fame, ventured to pre&s;ent an addre&s;s again&s;t the
duke of Somer&s;et, the dutche&s;s of Suffolk, the bi&s;hop of
Che&s;ter, Sir John Sutton lord Dudley, and &s;everal others
of inferior rank; and they prayed the King to remove
them for ever from his per&s;on and councils, and to pro|hibit
them from approaching within twelve miles of the
court<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary Hi&s;tory, vol. ii. p. 263.</NOTE>. This was a violent attack, &s;omewhat arbitrary,
and &s;upported but by few precedents, again&s;t the mini&s;try;
yet the King dur&s;t not entirely and openly oppo&s;e it: He
replied, that, except the lords, he would bani&s;h all the
others from court during a year, unle&s;s he had occa&s;ion
for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing any rebellion. At the
&s;ame time, he rejected a bill, which had pa&s;&s;ed both hou|&s;es
for attainting the late duke of Suffolk, and which di&s;|covered
a very general prejudice again&s;t the mea&s;ures of
the court.</P>
<P>THE duke of York,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1452.</NOTE> tru&s;ting to the&s;e &s;ymptoms,
rai&s;ed an army of 10,000 men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fir&s;t armament of the duke of York.</NOTE> with which he marched
towards London; demanding a reformation of the go|vernment,
and the removal of the duke of Somer&s;et
from all his power and authority<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 394.</NOTE>. He found unex|pectedly
the gates of the city &s;hut again&s;t him; and
on his retreating into Kent, he was followed by the
King at the head of a &s;uperior army; in which &s;everal
of Richard's friends, particularly Sali&s;bury and Warwic
appeared; probably with a view of mediating between
the parties, and of &s;econding, on occa&s;ion, the duke of
<PB N="205" REF="219">
York's preten&s;ions. A parley en&s;ued; Richard &s;till in|&s;i&s;ted
upon the removal of Somer&s;et, and his &s;ubmitting
to a trial in parliament: The court pretended to com|ply
with his demand; and that nobleman was put under
arre&s;t: The duke of York was then per&s;uaded to pay
his re&s;pects to the King in his tent; and on repeating
his charge again&s;t the duke of Somer&s;et, he was &s;ur|prized
to &s;ee that mini&s;ter &s;tep from behind the curtain,
and offer to ju&s;tify his innocence. Richard now found,
that he was betrayed; that he was in the hands of his
enemies; and that it was become nece&s;&s;ary, for his own
&s;afety, to lower his preten&s;ions. No violence, however,
was attempted again&s;t him: The nation was not in a
di&s;po&s;ition to bear the de&s;truction of &s;o popular a prince:
He had many friends in Henry's army: And his &s;on,
who was not in the power of the court, might &s;till be
able to revenge his death on all his enemies: He was
therefore di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and he retired to his &s;eat at Wigmore
on the borders of Wales<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 620.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE the duke of York lived in this retreat, there
happened an incident, which, by encrea&s;ing the public
di&s;contents, proved favourable to his hopes. Several
Ga&s;con lords, affectionate to the Engli&s;h government,
and di&s;gu&s;ted with the new dominion of the French,
came to London, and offered to return to their allegiance
under Henry<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 640.</NOTE>. The earl of Shrew&s;bury, with a body
of 8000 men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1453.</NOTE> was &s;ent over to &s;upport them. Bour|deaux
opened its gates to him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th July</NOTE> He made him&s;elf ma&s;ter
of Fron&s;ac, Ca&s;tillon, and &s;ome other places: His affairs
bore for &s;ome time a pro&s;perous a&s;pect: But as King
Charles ha&s;tened to re&s;i&s;t this dangerous inva&s;ion, the
fortunes of the Engli&s;h were then rever&s;ed; Shrew&s;bury,
a venerable warrior above eighty years of age, was kill|ed
in battle; his conque&s;ts were lo&s;t; Bourdeaux was
<PB N="206" REF="220">
again obliged to &s;ubmit to the French King<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. p. 501. Grafton, p. 623.</NOTE>; and all
hopes of recovering that province were for ever extin|gui&s;hed.</P>
<P>THO' the English might deem them&s;elves happy to be
fairly rid of di&s;tant dominions, which were of no u&s;e to
them, and which they never could defend again&s;t the
growing power of France; they expre&s;&s;ed great di&s;con|tent
on this occa&s;ion; and they threw all the blame on
the mini&s;try, who had not been able to effect impo&s;&s;ibi|lities.
While they were in this di&s;po&s;ition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13 October.</NOTE> the birth of
a &s;on to Henry, who was baptized under the name of
Edward, was deemed no joyful incident; and as it re|moved
all hopes of the peaceable &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the duke
of York, who was otherwi&s;e, in the right of his father,
and by the laws enacted &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e
of Lanca&s;ter, next heir to the crown, it had rather a
tendency to inflame the quarrel between the parties.
But the duke was incapable of violent councils; and
even when no vi&s;ible ob&s;tacle lay between him and
the throne, he was prevented by his own &s;cruples from
mounting it. Henry, always unfit to exerci&s;e the go|vernment,
fell at this time into a di&s;temper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1454.</NOTE> which &s;o
far encrea&s;ed his natural imbecillity, that it rendered
him incapable of maintaining even the appearance of
royalty. The Queen and the council, de&s;titute of this
&s;upport, found them&s;elves unable to re&s;i&s;t the York party;
and they were obliged to yield to the torrent. They &s;ent
Somer&s;et to the Tower; and appointed Richard lieu|tenant
of the kingdom, with powers to open and hold a
&s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. p. 344.</NOTE>. That a&s;&s;embly al&s;o, taking
into con&s;ideration the &s;tate of the kingdom, created him
protector during plea&s;ure. Men, who thus entru&s;ted
royal authority to one, who had &s;uch evident and &s;trong
<PB N="207" REF="221">
preten&s;ions to the crown, were not &s;urely aver&s;e to his
taking immediate and full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. Yet the duke,
in&s;tead of pu&s;hing them to make farther conce&s;&s;ions,
appeared &s;omewhat timid and irre&s;olute even in receiving
that power which was tendered to him. He de&s;ired, that
it might be recorded in parliament, that this authority
was conferred on him of their own free motion, with|out
any application on his part: He expre&s;&s;ed his hopes,
that they would a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the exerci&s;e of it: He
made it a condition of his acceptance, that the other
lords, who were appointed to be of his council, &s;hould
al&s;o accept of that tru&s;t, and &s;hould exerci&s;e it: And
he required, that all the powers of his office &s;hould be
&s;pecified and defined by act of parliament. This mo|deration
of Richard was certainly very unu&s;ual and very
amiable; but it was attended with bad con&s;equences in
the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs, and by giving time for the
animo&s;ities of faction to ari&s;e and ferment, it proved the
&s;ource of all tho&s;e furious wars and commotions, which
en&s;ued.</P>
<P>THE enemies of the duke of York &s;oon found it
in their power to make advantage of his exce&s;&s;ive caution.
Henry having &s;o far recovered from his di&s;temper, as
to carry the appearance of exerci&s;ing the royal power;
they moved him to re&s;ume his authority, to annul the
regency of the duke, to relea&s;e Somer&s;et from the
Tower<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. p. 361. Holling&s;hed, p. 642. Grafton, p. 626.</NOTE>, and to commit the admini&s;tration into the
hands of that nobleman.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1455.</NOTE> Richard, &s;en&s;ible of the dan|gers,
which might attend his former acceptance of the
parliamentary commi&s;&s;ion, &s;hould he &s;ubmit to the an|nulling
of it, levied an army; but &s;till without ad|vancing
any preten&s;ions to the crown. He complained
only of the King's mini&s;ters, and demanded a reforma|tion
<PB N="208" REF="222">
of the government. A battle was fought at St.
Albans, in which the Yorki&s;ts were &s;uperior, and with|out
&s;uffering any lo&s;s on their &s;ide, &s;lew above 5000 of
their enemies;<NOTE PLACE="marg">First battle of St. Al|bans.</NOTE> among whom were the duke of Somer|&s;et,
the earl of Northumberland, the earl of Stafford,
elde&s;t &s;on to the duke of Buckingham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d May.</NOTE> lord Clifford, and
many other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 399. Holling&s;hed, p. 643.</NOTE>. The King him|&s;elf
fell into the hands of the duke of York, who treated
him with great re&s;pect and tenderne&s;s: He was only
obliged (which he regarded as no hard&s;hip) to commit
the whole authority of the crown into the hands of his
rival.</P>
<P>THIS was the fir&s;t blood &s;pilt in that fatal quarrel,
which was not fini&s;hed in le&s;s than a cour&s;e of thirty
years, which was &s;ignalized by twelve pitched battles,
which opened a &s;cene of extraordinary fiercene&s;s and
cruelty, is computed to have co&s;t the lives of eighty
princes of the blood, and almo&s;t entirely annihilated the
antient nobility of England. The &s;trong attachments,
which, at that time, men of the &s;ame kindred bore to
each other, and the vindictive &s;pirit which was con&s;idered
as a point of honour, rendered the great families impla|cable
in their re&s;entments, and widened every moment
the breach between the parties. Yet affairs did not im|mediately
proceed to the la&s;t extremities: The nation
was kept for &s;ome time in &s;u&s;pen&s;e: The vigour and
&s;pirit of Queen Margaret, &s;upporting her &s;mall power,
&s;till proved a balance to the great authority of Richard,
which was checked by his irre&s;olute temper. A parlia|ment,
which was &s;oon after a&s;&s;embled, di&s;covered plainly
by the contrariety of their proceedings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th July.</NOTE> the contrariety
of the motives by which they were actuated. They
granted the Yorki&s;ts a general indemnity; and they re|&s;tored
the protector&s;hip to the duke, who in accepting it,
<PB N="209" REF="223">
&s;till per&s;evered in all his former precautions: But at the
&s;ame time, they renewed their oaths of fealty to Henry,
and fixed the continuance of the protector&s;hip to the
majority of his elde&s;t &s;on Edward, who was ve&s;ted in
the u&s;ual dignities of prince of Wales, duke of Corn|wal,
and earl of Che&s;ter. The only deci&s;ive act, pa&s;&s;ed
by this parliament, was a full re&s;umption of all the
grants, which had been made &s;ince the death of Henry V.
and which had reduced the crown to the mo&s;t &s;candalous

<P>IT was not found difficult to wre&s;t power from hands
&s;o little tenacious as tho&s;e of the duke of York.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1456.</NOTE> Mar|garet,
availing her&s;elf of that prince's ab&s;ence, pro|duced
her hu&s;band before the hou&s;e of lords; and as his
&s;tate of health permitted him at that time to act his part
with &s;ome tolerable decency, he declared his intentions
to re&s;ume the government, and to put an end to Richard's
authority. This mea&s;ure, being unexpected, was not
oppo&s;ed by the contrary party: The hou&s;e of lords, who
were many of them di&s;gu&s;ted with the late act of re|&s;umption,
a&s;&s;ented to Henry's propo&s;al: And the King
was accordingly declared to be rein&s;tated in his &s;overeign
authority. The duke of York even acquie&s;ced in this
irregular act of the peers; and no di&s;turbance en&s;ued.
But that prince's claim to the crown was too well known,
and the &s;teps, which he had taken to promote it, were
too evident, ever to allow &s;incere tru&s;t and confidence to
have place between the parties.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1457.</NOTE> The court retired to
Coventry, and invited the duke of York and the earls of
Sali&s;bury and Warwic to attend the King's per&s;on. As
they were on the road, they received intelligence, that
de&s;igns were formed by their enemies again&s;t their liber|ties

Richard withdrew to his ca&s;tle of Wigmore in the county

of Hereford: Sali&s;bury to Middleham in York&s;hire:
And Warwic to his government of Calais, which had
been committed to him after the battle of St. Albans,
and which, as it gave him the command of the only
regular military force maintained by England, was of
the utmo&s;t importance in the pre&s;ent juncture. Still,
men of peaceable di&s;po&s;itions, and among the re&s;t Bour|chier,
archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, thought it not too
late to interpo&s;e with their good offices, in order to pre|vent
that effu&s;ion of blood, with which the kingdom
was threatened; and the awe, in which each party &s;tood
of the other, rendered their mediation for &s;ome time &s;uc|ce&s;sful.
It was agreed, that all the great leaders on both
&s;ides &s;hould meet in London, and be &s;olemnly reconciled.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1458.</NOTE>
The duke of York and his partizans came thither with
numerous retinues, and took up their quarters near each
other for mutual &s;ecurity. The chieftains of the Lan|ca&s;trian
party u&s;ed the &s;ame precaution. The mayor, at
the head of 5000 men, kept a &s;trict guard, night and
day; and was extremely vigilant in maintaining peace
between them<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Fabian Chron. anno 1458. The author &s;ays, that &s;ome lords brought 900 retainers, &s;ome 600, none le&s;s than 400. See al&s;o Graf|ton, p. 633.</NOTE>. Terms were adju&s;ted, which took not
away the ground of difference. An outward reconcilia|tion
only was procured: And in order to notify this ac|cord
to the whole people, a &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion to St.

hand in hand with a chieftain of the oppo&s;ite<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 648. Polyd. Virg. p. 506. Grafton, p. 634.</NOTE>. The le&s;s

of friendship and amity redoubled. But it
was evident to all men of &s;en&s;e, that a conte&s;t for a
crown could not thus be peaceably accommodated; that
<PB N="211" REF="225">
each party only watched for an opportunity of &s;ubvert|ing
the other; and that much blood mu&s;t yet be &s;pilt,
ere the nation could be re&s;tored to perfect tranquillity, or

<P>EVEN the &s;malle&s;t accident,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1459.</NOTE> without any formed de|&s;ign,
was &s;ufficient, in the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of mens
minds, to di&s;&s;olve the &s;eeming amity between the parties;
and had the intentions of the leaders been ever &s;o ami|cable,
they would have found it difficult to re&s;train the animo&s;ity
of their followers. One of the King's reti|nue
in&s;ulted one of the earl of Warwic's: Their com|panions
on each &s;ide took part in the quarrel: A fierce
combat en&s;ued: The earl apprehended his life to be
aimed at: He fled over to his government at Calais<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Crafton, p. 635.</NOTE>;
and both parties, in every county of England, openly
made preparations for deciding the conte&s;t by war and
arms.</P>
<P>THE earl of Sali&s;bury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Blore-heath.</NOTE> marching to join the duke of
York, was overtaken, at Blore-heath on the borders of
Stafford&s;hire, by lord Audley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d Sept.</NOTE> who commanded much
&s;uperior forces; and a &s;mall rivulet with &s;teep bank^s
ran between the two armies. Sali&s;bury here &s;upplied his
defect in numbers by &s;tratagem; a refinement, of which
there occur few in&s;tances in the Engli&s;h civil wars,
where a headlong courage, more than military conduct,
is commonly to be remarked. He feigned a retreat,
and allured Audley to follow him with precipitation: But
when part of the royal army had pa&s;&s;ed the brook, Sali&s;|bury
&s;uddenly turned upon them; and partly by the
&s;urprize, partly by the divi&s;ion of the enemies forces,
put them to rout: The example of flight was followed
by the re&s;t of the army: And Sali&s;bury, obtaining a

complete victory, reached the general rendezvous of the
Yorki&s;ts at Ludlow<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 649. Grafton, p. 936.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE earl of Warwic brought over to this rendezvous a
choice body of veterans from Calais, on whom, it was
thought, the fortune of the war would much depend;
but this reinforcement proved, in the i&s;&s;ue, the ruin of
the duke of York's party. When the royal army ap|proached,
and a general action was every hour expected,
Sir Andrew Trollop, who commanded the veterans, de|&s;erted
to the King in the night-time; and the York|i&s;ts
were &s;o di&s;mayed by this in&s;tance of treachery,
which made every man apprehen&s;ive of his fellow, that
they &s;eparated next day without &s;triking a &s;troke<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 650. Grafton, p. 537.</NOTE>: The
duke of York fled to Ireland: The earl of Warwic,
attended by many of the other leaders, e&s;caped to his
government of Calais; where his great popularity among
all orders of men in the kingdom, particularly among
the military, &s;oon drew to him partizans, and rendered
his power very formidable. The friends of the hou&s;e
of York in England kept them&s;elves every where in
readine&s;s to ri&s;e on the fir&s;t &s;ummons from their leaders.</P>
<P>AFTER meeting with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;&s;es at &s;ea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1460.</NOTE> War|wic

being met by the primate, the lord Cobham, and other
per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, he marched, amid&s;t the acclama|tions
of the people, to London. The city immediately
opened its gates to him; and his troops encrea&s;ing on

to face the royal army, which ha&s;tened from Co|ventry
to attack him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Northamp|ton.</NOTE> The battle was fought at North|ampton;<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th July.</NOTE>

the infidelity of lord Grey of Ruthin, who, commanding
Henry's vanguard, de&s;erted to the enemy during the
heat of action, and &s;pread a con&s;ternation thro' the
troops. The duke of Buckingham, the earl of Shrew&s;|bury,
the lords Beaumont and Egremont, and Sir Wil|liam
Lucie were killed in the action or pur&s;uit: The
&s;laughter fell chiefly on the gentry and nobility; the
common people were &s;pared by orders of the earls of
Warwic and Marche<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 409.</NOTE>. Henry him&s;elf, that empty &s;ha|dow
of a King, was again taken pri&s;oner; and as the
innocence and &s;implicity of his manners, which bore the
appearance of &s;anctity, had procured him the tender re|gard
of the people<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 169. Grafton, p. 595.</NOTE>, the earl of Warwic and the other

<P>A PARLIAMENT was &s;ummoned in the King's name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A parlia|ment.</NOTE>
and met at We&s;tmin&s;ter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th Oct.</NOTE> where the duke of York &s;oon
after appeared from Ireland. This prince had never hi|therto
advanced openly any claim to the crown: He had
only complained of ill mini&s;ters, and demanded a redre&s;s
of grievances: And even in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, when the
parliament was &s;urrounded by his victorious army, he
&s;howed &s;uch a regard to law and liberty, as is very unu&s;ual
during the prevalence of a party in any civil di&s;&s;en&s;ions;
and was &s;till le&s;s to be expected, in tho&s;e violent and li|centious
times. He advanced towards the throne; and
being met by the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, who a&s;ked
him, whether he had yet paid his re&s;pects to the King?
he replied, that he knew of none to whom he owed that
title. He then &s;tood near the throne<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 655.</NOTE>, and addre&s;&s;ing
him&s;elf to the hou&s;e of peers, he gave them a deduction
of his title by de&s;cent, mentioned the cruelties by which
the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter had paved at fir&s;t their way to &s;o|vereign
<PB N="214" REF="228">
power, in&s;i&s;ted on the calamities which had at|tended
the government of Henry, exhorted them to re|turn
into the right path, by doing ju&s;tice to the lineal
&s;ucce&s;&s;or, and thus pleaded his cau&s;e before them as his
natural and lawful judges<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 665. Grafton, p. 643.</NOTE>. This cool and moderate
manner of demanding a crown, intimidated his friends
and encouraged his enemies: The lords remained in
&s;u&s;pence<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 657. Grafton, p. 645.</NOTE>; and no one ventured to utter a word on this
occa&s;ion. Richard, who had probably expected, that
the peers would have invited him to place him&s;elf on the
throne, was much di&s;appointed at their &s;ilence; but de|&s;iring
them to reflect on what he had propo&s;ed to them,
he departed the hou&s;e. The peers took the matter under
con&s;ideration, with as great tranquillity as if it had been
a common &s;ubject of debate: They de&s;ired the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of &s;ome con&s;iderable members among the commons in
their deliberations: They heard, in &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
days, the rea&s;ons alledged for the duke of York: They
even ventured to propo&s;e objections to his claim, founded
on former entails of the crown, and on the oaths of
fealty &s;worn to the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 666.</NOTE>: They al&s;o
ob&s;erved, that, as Richard had all along born the arms
of York, not tho&s;e of Clarence, he could not claim as
&s;ucce&s;&s;or to the latter family: And after receiving an|&s;wers
to the&s;e objections, derived from the violence and
power by which the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter &s;upported their
pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown; they ventured at la&s;t
to pronounce a deci&s;ion. Their &s;entence was calculated,
as far as po&s;&s;ible, to plea&s;e both parties: They declared
the title of the duke of York to be certain and inde|fea&s;ible;
but in con&s;ideration, that Henry had enjoyed
the crown, without di&s;pute or controver&s;y, during the
cour&s;e of thirty-eight years, they determined that he
<PB N="215" REF="229">
&s;hould continue to po&s;&s;e&s;s the title and dignity during
the remainder of his life; that the admini&s;tration of the
government, meanwhile, &s;hould remain with Richard,
that he &s;hould be acknowledged the true and lawful heir
of the monarchy, that every one &s;hould &s;wear to main|tain
his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that it &s;hould be trea&s;on to attempt
his life, and that all former &s;ettlements of the crown, in
this and the two la&s;t reigns, &s;hould be abrogated and
re&s;cinded<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 666. Grafton, p. 647.</NOTE>. The duke of York acquie&s;ced in this deci|&s;ion:
Henry him&s;elf, being a pri&s;oner, could not oppo&s;e
it: Even if he had enjoyed his liberty, he would not
probably have felt any violent reluctance again&s;t it: And
the act thus pa&s;&s;ed with the unanimous con&s;ent of the
whole legi&s;lative body. Tho' the mildne&s;s of this com|promi&s;e
is chiefly to be a&s;cribed to the moderation of
the duke of York, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to ob&s;erve in
tho&s;e tran&s;actions vi&s;ible marks of a higher regard to law,
and a more fixed authority, enjoyed by parliament, than
has appeared in any former period of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>IT is probable, that the duke of York, without em|ploying
either menaces or violence, could have obtained
from the commons a &s;ettlement more con&s;i&s;tent and uni|form:
But as many, if not all the members of, the upper
hou&s;e, had received grants, conce&s;&s;ions, or dignities,
during the la&s;t &s;ixty years, when the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter
was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the government, they were afraid of in|validating
their own titles by too &s;udden and violent an
overthrow of that family; and in thus temporizing be|tween
the parties, they fixed the throne on a ba&s;is, upon
which it could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;tand. The duke, appre|hending
his chief danger to ari&s;e from the genius and
&s;pirit of Queen Margaret, &s;ought a pretence for bani&s;h|ing
her entirely the kingdom; and for that purpo&s;e, he
<PB N="216" REF="230">
&s;ent her, in the King's name, a &s;ummons to come imme|diately
to London; intending, in ca&s;e of her di&s;obedience,
to proceed to extremities again&s;t her. But the queen
needed not this menace to excite her activity in behalf
of the rights of her family. After the defeat at North|ampton,
&s;he had fled with her infant &s;on to Durham,
and from thence to Scotland; but &s;oon returning, &s;he
applied to the northern barons, and employed every mo|tive
to procure their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Her affability, in&s;inua|tion,
and addre&s;s, qualities in which &s;he excelled; her
care&s;&s;es, her promi&s;es wrought a powerful effect on every
one who approached her: The admiration of her great
qualities was &s;ucceeded by compa&s;&s;ion towards her help|le&s;s
condition: The nobility of that quarter, who re|garded
them&s;elves as the mo&s;t warlike of the kingdom,
were moved by indignation to find the &s;outhern barons
di&s;po&s;e of the crown and &s;ettle the government: And
that they might allure the people to their &s;tandard, they
promi&s;ed them the &s;poils of all the provinces on the other
&s;ide the Trent. By the&s;e means, the Queen had collect|ed
an army twenty thou&s;and &s;trong, with a celerity
which was neither expected by her friends, nor appre|hended
by her enemies.</P>
<P>THE duke of York, informed of her appearance in
the north, ha&s;tened thither with a body of 5000 men,
to &s;uppre&s;s, as he imagined, the beginnings of an in&s;ur|rection;
when, on his arrival at Wakefield, he found
him&s;elf &s;o much out-numbered by his enemies. He threw
him&s;elf into Sandal ca&s;tle, which was &s;ituated in the
neighbourhood; and he was advi&s;ed by the earl of Sa|li&s;bury,
and other prudent coun&s;ellors, to remain in that
fortre&s;s, till his &s;on, the earl of Marche, who was levy|ing
forces in the borders of Wales, could advance to his
a&s;&s;i&s;tance<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 412.</NOTE>. But the duke, tho' deficient in political
<PB N="217" REF="231">
courage, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed per&s;onal bravery to an eminent degree;
and notwith&s;tanding all his wi&s;dom and experience, he
thought, that he &s;hould be forever di&s;graced, if, by
taking &s;helter behind walls, he &s;hould for a moment re|&s;ign
the victory to a woman.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Wakefield. 24th Dec.</NOTE> He de&s;cended into the
plain, and offered battle to the enemy, which was in
&s;tantly accepted. The great inequality of number was
&s;ufficient alone to decide the victory; but the Queen,
by &s;ending a detachment, who fell on the back of the
duke's army, rendered her advantage &s;till more certain
and undi&s;puted.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the Duke of York.</NOTE> The duke him&s;elf was killed in the
action; and as his body was found among the &s;lain, the
head was cut off by Margaret's orders, and fixed on
the gates of York, with a paper crown upon it, in de|ri&s;ion
of his pretended title. His &s;on, the earl of Rut|land,
a youth of &s;eventeen, was brought to lord Clifford;
and that barbarian, in revenge of his father's death, who
had peri&s;hed in the battle of St. Alban's, murdered,
in cold blood, and with his own hands, this innocent
prince, who&s;e exterior figure, as well as other accom|pli&s;hments,
are repre&s;ented by hi&s;torians as extremely
amiable. The earl of Sali&s;bury was wounded and taken
pri&s;oner, and immediately beheaded, with &s;everal other
per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, by martial law at Pomfret<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. P. 510.</NOTE>. There fell near three thou&s;and of the Yorki&s;ts in this
battle: The duke him&s;elf was greatly and ju&s;tly lament|ed
by his own party; a prince who &s;urely merited a
better fate, and who&s;e errors in conduct proceeded en|tirely
from &s;uch qualities, as render him the more an ob|ject
of e&s;teem and affection. He peri&s;hed in the fiftieth
year of his age, and left behind him three &s;ons, Edward,
George, and Richard, with three daughters, Anne, Eli|zabeth,

Pembroke was defeated by Edward at Mortimer's

His army was di&s;per&s;ed; he him&s;elf e&s;caped by flight;
but his father, Sir Owen Tudor, was taken pri&s;oner,

<P>MARGARET compen&s;ated this defeat by a victory
which &s;he obtained over the earl of Warwic. That
nobleman, on the approach of the Lanca&s;trians, led out
his army, re-inforced by a &s;trong body of the Lon|doners,
who were very affectionate to his cau&s;e; and
he gave battle to the Queen at St. Albans. While the
armies were warmly engaged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second battle of St. Albans.</NOTE> Lovelace, who commanded
a con&s;iderable body of the Yorki&s;ts, treacherou&s;ly with|drew
from the combat; and this di&s;honourable action,
of which there are many in&s;tances in the&s;e civil wars,
decided the victory in favour of the Queen. About
2300 of the Yorki&s;ts peri&s;hed in the battle and flight;
and the per&s;on of the King fell again into the hands of
his own party. This weak prince was &s;ure to be almo&s;t
equally a pri&s;oner whichever party had the keeping of him;
and &s;carce any more decorum was ob&s;erved by the one
than by the other in their method of treating him. Lord
Bonville, to who&s;e care he had been entru&s;ted, &s;taid with
him after the defeat, on a&s;&s;urance of pardon, given him
<PB N="219" REF="233">

promi&s;e, ordered immediately the head of that noble|man
to be &s;truck off by the executioner<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Holing&s;hed, p. 660.</NOTE>. Sir Thomas
Kiriel, a brave warrior, who had &s;ignalized him&s;elf in the
French wars, was treated in the &s;ame inhuman manner.</P>
<P>THE Queen made no great advantage of this victory:
Young Edward advanced upon her from the other &s;ide;
and collecting the remains of Warwic's army, was &s;oon
in a condition of giving her battle with &s;uperior forces.
She was &s;en&s;ible of her danger, if &s;he lay between the
enemy and the city of London; and &s;he found it nece&s;|&s;ary
to retreat with her army to the north<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 652.</NOTE>. Edward
entered London amid&s;t the acclamations of the citizens,
and immediately opened a new &s;cene to his party. This
prince, in the bloom of youth, remarkable for the beauty
of his per&s;on, for his bravery, his activity, his affability,
and every popular quality, found him&s;elf &s;o much po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
of public favour, that, elated with the &s;pirit
natural to his age, he re&s;olved no longer to con|fine
him&s;elf within tho&s;e narrow limits, which his
father had pre&s;cribed to him&s;elf, and which had been
found by experience &s;o prejudicial to his cau&s;e. He
determined to a&s;&s;ume the name and dignity of King;
to in&s;i&s;t openly on his claim; and thenceforth, to treat
the oppo&s;ite party as traitors and rebels to his lawful
authority. But as a national con&s;ent, or the appearance
of it, &s;eemed, notwith&s;tanding his plau&s;ible title, to be
&s;till requi&s;ite to precede this bold mea&s;ure, and as the
a&s;&s;embling a parliament might occasion too many delays,
and be attended with other inconveniencies, he ventured
to proceed in a le&s;e regular manner, and to put it out of
the power of his enemies to throw ob&s;tacles in the way
of his advancement. His army was ordered to a&s;&s;emble
in St. John's Fields; infinite numbers of people &s;ur|rounded

IV<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Gra&s;ton, p. 653.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN this manner, fini&s;hed the reign of Henry VI. a mo|narch,
who, while yet in his cradle, had been pro|claimed
King both of France and England, and who
began his life with the mo&s;t &s;plendid pro&s;pects, which
any prince in Europe had ever enjoyed. The revolution
was unhappy for his people, as it was the &s;ource of
civil wars; but was almo&s;t entirely indifferent to Henry
him&s;elf, who was utterly incapable of exerci&s;ing his au|thority,
and who, provided he met per&s;onally with good
u&s;age, was equally ea&s;y, as he was equally en&s;laved, in
the hands of his enemies and of his friends. His weak|ne&s;s
and his di&s;puted title were the chief cau&s;es of the
public misfortunes: But whether his Queen, and his
mini&s;ters, were not guilty of &s;ome great abu&s;es of power,
it is not ea&s;y for us at this di&s;tance to determine: There
remain no proofs on record of any con&s;iderable violation
of the laws, except in the death of the duke of Gloce|&s;ter,
which was a private crime, formed no precedent,
<PB N="221" REF="235">
and was but too much of a piece with the u&s;ual ferocity
and cruelty of the times.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t remarkable law, which pa&s;&s;ed in this reign,
was that for the due election of members of paliament
in counties.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mi&s;cella|neous tran|&s;actions of this reign.</NOTE> After the fall of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, the di|&s;tinction
of tenures was in a great mea&s;ure lo&s;t; and
every freeholder, as well tho&s;e who held of me&s;ne lords,
as the immediate tenants of the crown, were by degrees
admitted to give their votes at elections. This inno|vation
was confirmed by a law of Henry IV.<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Statutes at large, 7 Henry IV. cap. 15.</NOTE>; which
gave right to &s;uch a multitude of electors, as was the oc|ca&s;ion
of great di&s;order. In the eighth and tenth of this
King, therefore, laws were enacted, limiting the elec|tors
to &s;uch as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed forty &s;hillings a-year in land,
free from all burden, within the county<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 8 Henry IV. cap. 7. 10 Henry IV. cap. 2.</NOTE>. This &s;um
was equivalent to near twenty pounds a-year of our pre|&s;ent
money; and it were to be wi&s;hed, that the &s;pirit,
as well as letter of this law, had been maintained.</P>
<P>THE preamble of the &s;tatute is remarkable: &startq;Where|as
the elections of knights, have of late, in many
counties of England, been made by outrageous, and
exce&s;&s;ive numbers of people, many of them of &s;mall
&s;ub&s;tance and value, yet pretending to a right equal
to the be&s;t knights and e&s;quires; whereby man&s;laugh|ters,
riots, batteries, and divi&s;ions among the gentle|men
and other people of the &s;ame counties, &s;hall very
likely ri&s;e and be, unle&s;s due remedy be provided in
this behalf, &amp;c.&endq; We may learn from the&s;e expre&s;|&s;ions
what an important matter the election of a member
of parliament was now become in England: That a&s;|&s;embly
was beginning in this period to a&s;&s;ume great au|thority:
The commons had it much in their power to
enforce the execution of the laws; and if they failed in
<PB N="222" REF="236">
their duty, in this particular, it proceeded le&s;s from any
exorbitant power of the crown, than from the licentious
&s;pirit of the ari&s;tocracy, and perhaps from the rude edu|cation
of the age, and their own want of a due &s;en&s;e of
the advantages re&s;ulting from a regular admini&s;tration of
ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>WHEN the duke of York, the earls of Sali&s;bury and
Warwic, f$ed the kingdom upon the de&s;ertion of their
troops, a parliament was &s;ummoned at Coventry in 1460,
by which they were all attainted. This parliament
&s;eems to have been very irregularly con&s;tituted, and
&s;carcely de&s;erves the name: In&s;omuch, that an act
pa&s;&s;ed in it, &startq;that all &s;uch knights of any county,
as were returned by virtue of the King's letters,
without any other election, &s;hould be valid, and that
no &s;heriff, for returning them, &s;hould incur the pe|nalty
of the &s;tatute of Henry IV.&endq;<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 664.</NOTE> All the acts of
that parliament were afterwards rever&s;ed; &startq;becau&s;e it
was unlawfully &s;ummoned, and the knights and barone
not duly cho&s;en<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Statutes at large, 39 Henry VI. cap. 1.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THE parliaments in this reign, in&s;tead of relaxing their
vigilance again&s;t the u&s;urpations of the court of Rome,
endeavoured to enforce the former &s;tatutes enacted to
that purpo&s;e. The commons petitioned, that no foreigner
&s;hould be capable of any church preferment, and that
the patron might be allwed to pre&s;ent anew upon the
non-re&s;idence of any incumbent<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 585.</NOTE>: But the King eluded
the&s;e petitions. Pope Martin wrote him a &s;evere letter
again&s;t the &s;tatute of provi&s;ors; which he calls an abo|minable
&s;tatute, that would infallibly damn every one,
who ob&s;erved it<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Collection of Records, vol. i. p. 99.</NOTE>. The cardinal of Winche&s;ter was
legate; and being al&s;o a kind of prime mini&s;ter, and im|men&s;ely
<PB N="223" REF="237">
men&s;ely rich from the profits of his clerical dignity, the
parliament became jealous of his extending the papal
power; and they prote&s;ted, that the cardinal &s;hould ab|&s;ent
him&s;elf in all affairs and councils of the King, when|ever
the Pope or See of Rome was touched upon<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 593.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PERMISSION was given by parliament to export corn
when it was at low prices; wheat at &s;ix &s;hillings and
eight pence a quarter, money of that age; barley at three
&s;hillings and four pence<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Statutes at large, 15 Henry VI. cap. 2. 23 Henry VI. cap. 6.</NOTE>. It appears from the&s;e prices,
that corn &s;till remained at about half its pre&s;ent value;
tho' other commodities were much cheaper. The inland
commerce of corn was al&s;o opened in the eighteenth of
the King, by allowing any collector of the cu&s;toms to
give a licence for carrying it from one county to another<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 625.</NOTE>.
The &s;ame year a kind of navigation act was propo&s;ed
with regard to all places within the Streights; but the
King rejected it<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 626.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>YOUNG Edward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXII.</NOTE> now in his twentieth year, was
of a temper well fitted to make his way thro' &s;uch
a &s;cene of war, havoc, and deva&s;tation, as mu&s;t con|duct
him to the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that crown, which he
claimed from hereditary right, but which he had a&s;&s;umed
from the tumultuary election alone of his own party. He
was bold, active, enterprizing; and his hardne&s;s of heart
and &s;everity of character rendered him impregnable to all
tho&s;e movements of compa&s;&s;ion, which might relax his
vigour in the pro&s;ecution of the mo&s;t bloody revenges
again&s;t his enemies. The very commencement of his
reign gave &s;ymptoms of his &s;anguinary di&s;po&s;ition. A
trade&s;man of London, who kept &s;hop at the &s;ign of the
<PB N="225" REF="239">
crown, having &s;aid, that he would make his &s;on heir to
the crown; this harmle&s;s plea&s;antry was interpreted to
be &s;poke in deri&s;ion of Edward's a&s;&s;umed title; and he
was condemned and executed for the offence<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Habington in Kennet, p. 431. Grafton, p. 791.</NOTE>. Such
an act of tyranny was a proper prelude to the &s;cenes,
which en&s;ued. The &s;caffold, as well as the field, &s;tream|ed
ince&s;&s;antly with the noble&s;t blood of England, &s;pilt
in the quarrel between the two contending families,
who&s;e animo&s;ity was now become implacable. The
people, divided in their affections, took al&s;o oppo&s;ite
&s;ymbols of party: The partizans of the hou&s;e of Lan|ca&s;ter
cho&s;e the red ro&s;e as their mark of di&s;tinction;
tho&s;e of York were denominated from the white; and
the&s;e civil wars were thus known, all over Europe, by
the name of the quarrel between the two ro&s;es.</P>
<P>THE licence, in which queen Margaret had been
obliged to indulge her troops, &s;truck a great terror into
the city of London and all the &s;outhern parts of the king|dom;
and as &s;he there expected a very ob&s;tinate re|&s;i&s;tance,
&s;he prudently retired northwards among her own
partizans. The &s;ame licence, joined to the zea$ of fac|tion,
&s;oon brought great multitudes to her &s;tandard; and
&s;he was able, in a few days, to a&s;&s;emble an army &s;ixty
thou&s;and &s;trong in York&s;hire. The King and the earl of
Warwic made ha&s;te, with an army of forty thou&s;and,
to check her progre&s;s; and when they reached Pom|fret,
they di&s;patched a body of troops, under the com|mand
of the lord Fitzwalter, to &s;ecure the pa&s;&s;age of
Ferrybridge over the river Are, which lay between them
and the enemy. Fitzwalter took po&s;t at the place a&s;|&s;igned
him; but was not able to defend it again&s;t lord
Clifford, who attacked him with &s;uperior numbers. The
Yorki&s;ts were cha&s;ed over the river with great &s;laugh|ter;
<PB N="226" REF="240">
and lord Fitzwalter him&s;elf was &s;lain in the ac|tion<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">W. Wyrce&s;ter, p. 489. Hall, fol. 186. Holing&s;hed, p. 664.</NOTE>.
The earl of Warwic, dreading the con&s;equences
of this misfortune, at a time when a deci&s;ive action was
every hour expected, immediately ordered his hor&s;e to
be brought him, which he &s;tabbed before the whole ar|my;
and ki&s;&s;ing the hilt of his &s;word, &s;wore, that he
was determined to &s;hare the fate of the meane&s;t &s;oldier<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Habington, p. 432.</NOTE>.
And to &s;hew the greater fecurity, a proclamation was at
the &s;ame time i&s;&s;ued, giving to every one who plea&s;ed
full liberty to retire; but menacing the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;h|ments
to tho&s;e who &s;hould di&s;cover any &s;ymptoms of
cowardice in the en&s;uing battle<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Holing&s;hed, p. 664.</NOTE>. Lord Falconbridge was
&s;ent to recover the po&s;t which had been lo&s;t; he pa&s;&s;ed the
river &s;ome miles above Ferrybridge, and falling unexpect|edly
on lord Clifford, he revenged the former di&s;a&s;ter by
the defeat of the party and the death of their leader<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Croyl. cont. p. 532.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE two ho&s;tile armies met at Touton;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Touton. 29th of March.</NOTE> and a fierce
and bloody battle en&s;ued. While the Yorki&s;ts were ad|vancing
to the charge, there happened a great fall of
&s;now, which, driving full on the faces of their enemies,
blinded them; and this advantage was improved by a
&s;tratagem of lord Falconbridge. That nobleman or|dered
&s;ome infantry to advance before the line, and
after having &s;ent a volley of flight-arrows, as they were
called, amid&s;t the enemy, immediately to retire. The
Lanca&s;trians, imagining that they were got within reach
of the oppo&s;ite army, di&s;charged all their arrows, which
thus fell &s;hort of the Yorki&s;ts, without doing any execu|tion<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 186.</NOTE>. After the quivers of the enemy were exhau&s;ted,
Edward advanced his line, and committed &s;laughter with
impunity on the di&s;mayed Lanca&s;trians: The bow how|ever
was &s;oon laid a&s;ide, and the &s;word decided the combat,
<PB N="227" REF="241">
which ended in a total victory on the &s;ide of the York|i&s;ts.
Edward i&s;&s;ued orders to give no quarter<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Habington, p. 432.</NOTE>: The
routed army was pur&s;ued to Tadca&s;ter with great blood|&s;hed
and confu&s;ion; and above thirty-&s;ix thou&s;and men
are computed to have fallen in the battle and pur&s;uit<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Holing&s;hed, p. 665. Grafton, p. 656. Hi&s;t. Croyl. cont. p. 533.</NOTE>:
Among the&s;e were the earl of We&s;tmoreland, and his
brother, Sir John Nevil, the earl of Northumberland,
the lords Dacres and Welles, and Sir Andrew Trollop<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 187. Habington, p. 433.</NOTE>.
The earl of Devon&s;hire, who was now engaged in Hen|ry's
party, was brought a pri&s;oner to Edward; and was
&s;oon after beheaded by martial law at York. His head
was fixed on a pole erected over the gates of that city;
and the head of duke Richard and that of the earl of Sa|li&s;bury
were taken down, and buried with their bodies.
Henry and Margaret had remained at York during the
action; but learning the defeat of their army, and being
&s;en&s;ible, that no place in England could now afford them
&s;helter, they fled with great precipitation into Scotland.
They were accompanied by the duke of Exeter, who,
tho' he had married Edward's &s;i&s;ter, had taken part with
the Lanca&s;trians, and by Henry duke of Somer&s;et, who
had commanded in the unfortunate battle of Touton,
and who was the &s;on of that nobleman killed in the fir&s;t
battle of St. Albans.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the great animo&s;ity, which pre|vailed
between the two kingdoms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry e&s;capes in|to Scotland.</NOTE> Scotland had never
exerted it&s;elf with vigour, to take advantage either of
the wars which England carried on with France, or of
the civil wars which broke out between the contending
families. James I. more laudably employed, in civilizing
his &s;ubjects and taming them to the &s;alutary yoke of law
and ju&s;tice, avoided all ho&s;tilities with foreign nations;
<PB N="228" REF="242">
and tho' he &s;eemed intere&s;ted to maintain a balance be|tween
France and England, he gave no farther a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
to the former kingdom in its greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es,
than permitting, and perhaps encouraging, his &s;ubjects
to inli&s;t in the French &s;ervice. After the murder of that
excellent prince, the minority of his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or,
James II. and the di&s;tractions incident to it, retained the
Scots in the &s;ame &s;tate of neutrality; and the &s;uperiority,
vi&s;ibly acquired by France, rendered it then unnece&s;&s;ary
for her ally to interpo&s;e in her defence. But when the
quarrel commenced between the hou&s;es of York and
Lanca&s;ter, and became ab&s;olutely incurable but by the
total extinction of one party; James, who had now
ri&s;en to man's e&s;tate, was tempted to &s;eize this ad|vantage,
and he endeavoured to recover tho&s;e pla|ces,
which the Engli&s;h had formerly conquered from
his ance&s;tors. He laid &s;iege to the ca&s;tle of Roxbo|rough
in 1460, and had provided him&s;elf of a &s;mall
train of artillery for that enterprize: But his cannon
were &s;o ill framed, that one of them bur&s;t as he was
firing it, and put an end to his life in the flower of his
age. His &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, James III. was al&s;o a mi|nor:
The u&s;ual di&s;tractions en&s;ued in the government:
The Queen-dowager, Anne of Gueldres, a&s;pired to the
regency: The family of Douglas oppo&s;ed her preten|&s;ions:
And Queen Margaret, when &s;he fled into Scot|land,
found there a people little le&s;s divided by faction,
than tho&s;e by whom &s;he had been expelled. Tho' &s;he
pleaded the connexions between the royal family of Scot|land
and the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, by the young King's
grandmother, who was a daughter of the earl of So|mer&s;et;
&s;he could engage the Scots council to go no
farther than to expre&s;s their good wi&s;hes in her favour:
But on her offer to deliver to them immediately the im|portant
fortre&s;s of Berwic, and to contract her &s;on in
marriage with a &s;i&s;ter of King James, &s;he found a be|tter
<PB N="229" REF="243">
reception; and the Scots promi&s;ed the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
their arms to re-in&s;tate her family upon the throne<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 137. Habington, p. 434.</NOTE>.
But as the danger from that quarter &s;eemed not very ur|gent
to Edward, he did not pur&s;ue the fugitive King
and Queen into their retreat; but returned to London,
where a parliament was &s;ummoned for &s;ettling the go|vernment.</P>
<P>ON the meeting of this a&s;&s;embly, Edward found the<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th Nov. A parliament.</NOTE>
good effects of his vigorous mea&s;ure in a&s;&s;uming the
crown, as well as of his victory at Touton, by which he
had &s;ecured it: The parliament no longer he&s;itated be|tween
the two families, or propo&s;ed any of tho&s;e ambi|guous
deci&s;ions, which could only tend to perpetuate
and inflame the animo&s;ities of party. They recognized
the title of Edward to the crown, by hereditary de&s;cent,
thro' the family of Mortimer; and declared, that he was
King in right, from the death of his father, who had
al&s;o the &s;ame lawful title; and that he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the throne from the day that he a&s;&s;umed the go|vernment,
tendered to him by the acclamations of the
people<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 670.</NOTE>. They expre&s;&s;ed their abhorrence of the u&s;urpa|tion
and intru&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, particularly
that of the earl of Derby, otherwi&s;e called Henry IV.
which, they &s;aid, had been attended with every kind of
di&s;order, the murder of the &s;overeign and the oppre&s;&s;ion
of the &s;ubjects. They annulled every grant which had
pa&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e reigns; they rein&s;tated the King in all
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which had belonged to the erown at the
pretended depo&s;ition of Richard II. and tho' they con|firmed
judicial deeds and the decrees of inferior courts,
they rever&s;ed all attainders pa&s;&s;ed in any pretended par|liament;
particularly the attainder of the earl of Cam|bridge,
the King's grandfather; as well as that of the
<PB N="230" REF="244">
earls of Sali&s;bury and Gloce&s;ter and of lord Lumley,
who were forfeited for adhering to Richard II<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 672. Statutes at large, 1 Edw. IV. cap. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MANY of the&s;e votes were the re&s;ult of the u&s;ual vio|lence
of party: The common &s;en&s;e of mankind, in more
peaceable times, repealed them: And the &s;tatutes of the
hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, being the deeds of an e&s;tabli&s;hed go|vernment,
and enacted by princes long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of au|thority,
have always been held as valid and obligatory.
The parliament, however, in &s;ubverting &s;uch deep foun|dations,
had &s;till the pretence of replacing the govern|ment
on its antient and natural ba&s;is: But in their &s;ub|&s;equent
mea&s;ures, they were more guided by revenge, or
at lea&s;t the views of convenience, than by the maxims of
equity and ju&s;tice. They pa&s;&s;ed an act of forfeiture and
attainder again&s;t Henry VI. and Queen Margaret, and
their infant &s;on, prince Edward: The &s;ame act was ex|tended
to the dukes of Somer&s;et and Exeter; to the
carls of Northumberland, Devon&s;hire, Pembroke, Wilts;
to the vi&s;count Beaumont, the lords Roos, Nevil, Clif|ford,
Wells, Dacre, Gray of Rugemont, Hungerford; to
Alexander Hedie, Nicholas Latimer, Edmond Mountfort,
John Heron, and many other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 670. W. Wyrce&s;ter, p. 490.</NOTE>.
The parliament ve&s;ted the e&s;tates of all the&s;e attainted
per&s;ons in the crown; tho' their &s;ole crime was the ad|hering
to a prince, whom every individual of the parlia|ment
had &s;o long recognized, and whom that very King
him&s;elf, who was now &s;eated on the throne, had acknow|ledged
and obeyed as his lawful &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upporting the government e&s;tabli&s;hed,
will ju&s;tify more fully &s;ome other acts of violence; tho'
the method of conducting them may &s;till appear excep|tionable.

It involved a full dictatorial power, continually &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the &s;tate. The only check on the crown, be&s;ides the want of force to &s;upport all its prerogatives, was, that the office of con&s;table was commonly either hereditary or during life; and the per&s;on inve&s;ted with it, was, for that rea&s;on, not &s;o proper an in&s;tru|ment of arbitrary power in the King.

The practice, however, of exerci&s;ing martial law, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; and was not aboli&s;hed till the Petition of Right under Charles I.

It was impo&s;&s;ible but &s;uch a great and &s;udden revolution
mu&s;t leave the roots of di&s;content and di&s;&s;atisfaction in
the &s;ubjects, which would require great art, or in lieu of

more &s;uitable to the genius of the nation in that uncul|tivated
age.</P>
<P>BUT the new e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;eemed precarious and
uncertain; not only from the dome&s;tic di&s;contents of the
people, but from the efforts of foreign powers. Lewis,
the eleventh of the name, had &s;ucceeded to his father,
Charles, in 1460; and was led, from the obvious mo|tives
of national intere&s;t, to feed the flames of civil di&s;|cord
among &s;uch dangerous neighbours, by giving &s;up|port
to the weaker party. But the intriguing and politic
genius of this prince was here checked by it&s;elf: Having
attempted to &s;ubdue the independant &s;pirit of his own
va&s;&s;als, he had excited &s;uch an oppo&s;ition at home, as
prevented him from making all the advantage, which the

Montague was &s;o elated with this &s;ucce&s;s, that,

join him by orders from Edward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Hexham. 15th May.</NOTE> he yet ventured, with
his own troops alone, to attack the Lanca&s;trians at

but too plau&s;ible an apology from the preceding
practice of the Lanca&s;trians.</P>
<P>THE fate of the unfortunate royal family, after this
defeat, was very &s;ingular. Margaret, flying with her
&s;on into a fore&s;t, where &s;he endeavoured to conceal her|&s;elf,
was be&s;et, during the darkne&s;s of the night, by
robbers, who either ignorant or regardle&s;s of her quality,
de&s;poiled her of her rings and jewels, and treated her
with the utmo&s;t indignity. The partition of this rich
booty rai&s;ed a quarrel among them; and while their at|tention
was thus engaged, &s;he took the opportunity of
making her e&s;cape with her &s;on into the thicke&s;t of the

with hunger and fatigue, and &s;unk with terror and af|fliction.
While in this wretched condition, &s;he &s;aw a
robber approach with his naked &s;word; and finding
that &s;he had no means of e&s;cape, &s;he &s;uddenly em|braced
the re&s;olution of tru&s;ting entirely for protec|tion
to his faith and genero&s;ity. She advanced to|wards
him; and pre&s;enting to him the young prince,
called out to him, <HI>Here, my friend, I commit to your
care the &s;afety of your King's &s;on.</HI> The man, who&s;e
humanity and generous &s;pirit had been ob&s;cured, but
not entirely lo&s;t, by his vicious cour&s;e of life, was
&s;truck with the &s;ingul$rity of the event, and charmed
with the confidence repo&s;ed in him; and he vowed, not
only to ab&s;tain from all injury again&s;t the prince&s;s, but
to devote him&s;elf entirely to her &s;afety and protection<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;trelet, vol. iii. p. 96.</NOTE>.
By his means &s;he dwelt &s;ome time concealed in the fore&s;t,
and was at la&s;t conducted to the &s;ea-coa&s;t, whence &s;he
made her e&s;cape into Flanders. She pa&s;&s;ed thence into
her father's court, where &s;he lived &s;everal years in pri|vacy
and retirement. Her hu&s;band was not &s;o fortunate
or &s;o dextrous in finding the means of his e&s;cape. Some
of his friends took him under their protection, and con|veyed
him into Lanca&s;hire; where he remained con|cealed
during a twelvemonth; but he was at la&s;t detect|ed,
delivered up to Edward, and thrown into the Tower<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 191. Fragm. ad finem Sproti.</NOTE>.
The &s;afety of his per&s;on was owing le&s;s to the genero&s;ity
of his enemies, than to the contempt, which they had
entertained of his courage and his under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>THE impri&s;onment of Henry, the expul&s;ion of Mar|garet,
the execution and confi&s;cation of all the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable
Lanca&s;trians, &s;eemed to give full &s;ecurity to
Edward's government; who&s;e title by blood, being now
<PB N="235" REF="251">
recognized by parliament, and univer&s;ally &s;ubmitted to
by the people, was no longer in danger of being im|peached
by any antagoni&s;t. In this pro&s;perous &s;ituation,
the King delivered him&s;elf up, without controul, to tho&s;e
plea&s;ures which his youth, his high fortune, and his na|tural
temperament invited him to enjoy; and the cares
of royalty were le&s;s attended to, than the di&s;&s;ipation of
amu&s;ement, or the allurements of pa&s;&s;ion. The cruel
and unrelenting &s;pirit of Edward, tho' enured to the fe|rocity
of civil wars, was at the &s;ame time extremely
devoted to the &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions, which, without mitigating
his &s;evere temper, maintained a great influence over him,
and &s;hared his attachment with the pur&s;uits of ambition,
and the thir&s;t of military glory. During the pre&s;ent in|terval
of peace, he lived in the mo&s;t familiar and &s;o|ciable
manner with his &s;ubjects<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. p. 513. Biondi.</NOTE>, particularly with the
Londoners; and the beauty of his per&s;on, as well as
the gallantry of his addre&s;s, which, even una&s;&s;i&s;ted by
his royal dignity, would have rendered him extremely
acceptable to the fair &s;ex, facilitated all his applications
for their favour. This ea&s;y and plea&s;urable life aug|mented
every day his popularity among all ranks of men:
He was the peculiar favourite of the young and gay of
both &s;exes: The di&s;po&s;ition of the Engli&s;h, little ad|dicted
to jealou&s;y, kept them from taking umbrage at
the&s;e liberties: And his indulgence in amu&s;ements, while
it gratified his inclination, was thus become, without
de&s;ign, a means of &s;upporting and &s;ecuring his govern|ment:
But as it is difficult to reduce the ruling pa&s;&s;ion
within &s;trict rules of prudence, the amorous temper of
Edward led him into a &s;nare which proved very fatal to
his future repo&s;e, and to the &s;tability of his throne.</P>
<P>JAQUELINE DE LUXEMBOURG, dutche&s;s of Bedford,
<PB N="236" REF="252">
had, after her hu&s;band's death, &s;o far &s;acrificed her am|bition
to love, that &s;he e&s;pou&s;ed, in &s;econd marriage,
Sir Richard Wideville, a private gentleman, afterwards
created lord Rivers, to whom &s;he bore &s;everal children,
and among the re&s;t, Eli|zabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's marriage with the lady Elizabeth Gray.</NOTE> who was remarkable for
the grace and beauty of her per&s;on, as well as for other
amiable accompli&s;hments. This young lady had married
Sir John Gray of Groby, by whom &s;he had children; and
her hu&s;band being killed in the &s;econd battle of St. Albans,
fighting on the &s;ide of Lanca&s;ter, and his e&s;tate being
for that rea&s;on confi&s;cated, his widow retired to live with
her father, at his &s;eat of Grafton in Northampton&s;hire.
The King came accidentally to the hou&s;e, after a hunt|ing
party, in order to pay a vi&s;it to the dutche&s;s of Bed|ford;
and as the occa&s;ion &s;eemed favourable for obtain|ing
&s;ome grace from this gallant monarch, the young
widow flung her&s;elf at his feet, and with many tears,
entreated him to take pity on her impoveri&s;hed and di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed
children. The &s;ight of &s;o much beauty in af|fliction,
&s;trongly affected the amorous Edward; love
&s;tole in&s;en&s;ibly into his heart under the gui&s;e of com|pa&s;&s;ion;
and her &s;orrow, &s;o becoming a virtuous matron,
made his e&s;teem and regard quickly corre&s;pond to his
affection. He rai&s;ed her from the ground with a&s;&s;urances
of favour; he found his pa&s;&s;ion encrea&s;e every moment,
by the conver&s;ation of the amiable object; and he was
&s;oon reduced in his turn to the po&s;ture and &s;tile of a
&s;upplicant at the feet of Elizabeth. But the lady, either
aver&s;e to di&s;honourable love from a &s;en&s;e of duty, or
perceiving that the impre&s;&s;ion which &s;he had made was
&s;o deep as to give her hopes of obtaining the highe&s;t
elevation, ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to gratify his pa&s;&s;ion; and
all the endearments, care&s;&s;es, and importunity of the
young and amiable Edward, proved fruitle&s;s again&s;t her
rigid and inflexible virtue. His pa&s;&s;ion, irritated by op|po&s;ition,
<PB N="237" REF="253">
and encrea&s;ed by his veneration for &s;uch ho|nourable
&s;entiments, carried him at la&s;t beyond all bounds
of rea&s;on; and he offered to &s;hare his throne, as well
as his heart, with the woman, who&s;e beauty of per&s;on,
and dignity of character, &s;eemed &s;o well to entitle her
to both. The marriage was celebrated privately at
Grafton<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 193. Fabian, fol. 216.</NOTE>: The &s;ecret was carefully kept for &s;ome
time: No one &s;u&s;pected, that &s;o libertine a prince could
&s;acrifice &s;o much to a romantic pa&s;&s;ion: And there were
in particular &s;trong rea&s;ons, which at that time ren|dered
this &s;tep in the highe&s;t degree dangerous and im|prudent.</P>
<P>THE King, de&s;irous to &s;ecure his throne, as well by
the pro&s;pect of i&s;&s;ue, as by foreign alliances, had, a
little before, determined to make application to &s;ome
neighbouring prince&s;s; and he had ca&s;t his eye on Bona
of Savoy, &s;i&s;ter to the Queen of France, who, he hoped,
would, by his marrying her, en&s;ure him the friend&s;hip
of that power, which was alone both able and inclined
to give &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his rival. To render
the negotiation more &s;ucce&s;sful, the earl of Warwic had
been di&s;patched to Paris, where the prince&s;s then re|&s;ided;
he had demanded Bona in marriage for the King;
his propo&s;als had been accepted; the treaty was fully
concluded; and nothing remained but the ratification of
the terms agreed on, and the bringing over the prince&s;s
into England<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 193. Habington, p. 437. Holing&s;hed, p. 667. Grafton, p. 665. Polyd, Virg. p. 513.</NOTE>. But when the &s;ecret of Edward's mar|riage
broke out, the haughty earl, deeming him&s;elf
affronted, both by being employed in this deceitful ne|gotiation,
and by being kept a &s;tranger to the King's
intentions, who had owed every thing to his friend&s;hip,
immediately returned to England, inflamed with rage
<PB N="238" REF="254">
and indignation. The influence of pa&s;&s;ion, over &s;o young
a man as Edward, might have &s;erved as an excu&s;e for his
imprudent conduct, had he deigned to acknowledge his
error, or had pleaded his weakne&s;s as an apology:
But his faulty &s;hame or pride prevented him from &s;o
much as mentioning the affair to Warwic; and that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Warwic di&s;gu&s;ted.</NOTE>
nobleman was allowed to depart the court, full of the
&s;ame ill humour and di&s;content, which he brought to it.</P>
<P>EVERY incident now tended to widen the breach be|tween
the King and this powerful &s;ubject.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1466.</NOTE> The Queen
lo&s;t not her influence by marriage; and &s;he was equally
&s;olicitous to draw every grace and favour to her own
friends and kindred, and to exclude tho&s;e of the earl,
whom &s;he regarded as her mortal enemy. Her father
was created earl of Rivers: He was made lord trea&s;urer
in the room of lord Mountjoy<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">W. Wyrce&s;ter, p. 506.</NOTE>: He was inve&s;ted in the
office of con&s;table for life; and his &s;on received the &s;ur|vivance
of that high dignity<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. p. 581.</NOTE>. The &s;ame young noble|man
was married to the only daughter of lord Scales,
enjoyed the great e&s;tate of that family, and had the title
of Scales conferred upon him. Catharine, the Queen's
&s;i&s;ter, was married to the young duke of Buckingham,
who was a ward of the crown<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">W. Wyrce&s;ter, p. 505.</NOTE>: Mary, another of her
&s;i&s;ters, e&s;pou&s;ed William Herbert, created earl of Hun|tingdon:
Anne, a third &s;i&s;ter, was given in marriage to
the &s;on and heir of Gray, lord Ruthyn, created earl of
Kent<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 506.</NOTE>. The daughter and heir of the duke of Exeter,
who was al&s;o the King's niece, was contracted to Sir
Thomas Gray, one of the Queen's &s;ons by her former
hu&s;band; and as the lord Montague was treating of a
marriage between his &s;on and this lady, the preference
<PB N="239" REF="255">
given to young Gray was deemed an injury and affront
to the whole family of Nevil.</P>
<P>THE earl of Warwic could not endure the lea&s;t dimi|nution
of that credit, which he had long enjoyed, and
which, he thought, he had merited by &s;uch important
&s;ervices. Tho' he had received &s;o many grants from the
crown, that the revenue ari&s;ing from them amounted,
be&s;ides his patrimonial e&s;tate, to 80,000 crowns a year,
according to the computation of Philip de Comines<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Liv. 5. chap. 4.</NOTE>;
his ambitious &s;pirit was &s;till di&s;&s;atisfied, &s;o long as he &s;aw
others &s;urpa&s;s him in authority and influence with the
King<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. p. 514.</NOTE>. Edward al&s;o, jealous of that power which had
&s;upported him, and which he him&s;elf had contributed
&s;till higher to exalt, was well plea&s;ed to rai&s;e up rivals
in credit to the earl of Warwic; and he ju&s;tified by this
political view, his extreme partiality to the Queen's
kindred. But the other nobility of England, envying
the &s;udden growth of the Widevilles<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Croyl. cont. p. 539.</NOTE>, were more in|clined
to take part with Warwic's di&s;content, to who&s;e
grandeur they were already accu&s;tomed, and who had
reconciled them to his &s;uperiority by his gracious and
popular manners. And as Edward obtained from par|liament
a general re&s;umption of all grants, which he had
made &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion, and which had extremely im|poveri&s;hed
the crown<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">W. Wyrce&s;ter, p. 508.</NOTE>; this act, tho' it pa&s;&s;ed with
&s;ome exceptions, particularly one in favour of the earl
of Warwic, gave a general alarm to the nobility, and
di&s;gu&s;ted many, even zealous partizans of the family of
York.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t con&s;iderable a&s;&s;ociate, whom Warwic
acquired to his party, was George, duke of Clarence,
<PB N="240" REF="256">
the King's &s;econd brother. This prince deemed him|&s;elf
no le&s;s injured than the other grandees, by the un|controuled
influence of the queen and her relations;
and as his fortunes were &s;till left on a precarious footing,
while theirs were fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, this neglect, joined
to his unquiet and re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit, inclined him to give
countenance to all the malecontents<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 673.</NOTE>. The favourable
opportunity of gaining him was e&s;pied by the earl of
Warwic, who offered him in marriage his elde&s;t daugh|ter,
and co-heir of his immen&s;e fortunes; a &s;ettlement
which, as it was &s;uperior to any that the King him&s;elf
could confer upon him, immediately attached him to the
earl's party<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">W. Wyrce&s;ter, p. 511. Hall, fol. 200. Habington, p. 439. Holing&s;hed, p. 671. Polyd. Virg. p. 515.</NOTE>. Thus an exten&s;ive and dangerous com|bination
was in&s;en&s;ibly formed again&s;t Edward and his
mini&s;try: Tho' the object of the malecontents was not
at pre&s;ent to overturn the throne, it was difficult to fore|&s;ee
the extremities, to which they might be carried; and
as oppo&s;ition to an admini&s;tration was u&s;ually in tho&s;e
ages pro&s;ecuted by force of arms, civil convul&s;ions and
di&s;orders were likely to be &s;oon the re&s;ult of the&s;e in|trigues
and confederacies.</P>
<P>WHILE this cloud was gathering at home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alliance with the duke of Burgundy.</NOTE> Edward
carried his views abroad, and endeavoured to &s;ecure him|&s;elf
again&s;t his factious nobility, by entering into foreign
alliances. The dark and dangerous ambition of Louis XI.
the more it was known, the greater alarm it excited
among all his neighbours and va&s;&s;als; and as it was &s;up|ported
by great abilities, and unre&s;trained by any prin|ciples
of faith or humanity, they found no &s;ecurity to
them&s;elves but by a jealous combination again&s;t him.
Philip, duke of Burgundy, was now dead: His rich and
<PB N="241" REF="257">
exten&s;ive dominions were devolved to Charles, his only
&s;on, who&s;e martial di&s;po&s;ition acquired him the &s;irname
of <HI>Hardy,</HI> and who&s;e ambition, more outrageous than
that of Lewis, but &s;econded by le&s;s power and policy,
was regarded with a more favourable eye by the other
powers of Europe. The oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts, and
&s;till more, a natural antipathy of character, produced
a declared animo&s;ity between the&s;e two bad princes; and
Edward was thus &s;ecure of the &s;incere attachment of
either of them, for whom he &s;hould choo&s;e to declare
him&s;elf. The duke of Burgundy, being de&s;cended by
his mother, a daughter of Portugal, from John of Gaunt,
was naturally inclined to favour the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 4. 6.</NOTE>:
But this con&s;ideration was ea&s;ily overbalanced by poli|tics;
and Charles, perceiving the intere&s;t of that hou&s;e
to be extremely decayed in England, &s;ent over his na|tural
brother, commonly called the ba&s;tard of Burgundy,
to carry in his name propo&s;als of marriage to Margaret the
King's &s;i&s;ter. The alliance of Burgundy was more popular
with the Engli&s;h, than that of France; the commercial
intere&s;ts of the two nations invited the princes to a clo&s;e
union; their common jealou&s;y of Lewis was a natural
cement between them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1468.</NOTE> and Edward, plea&s;ed with

BUT whatever ambitious &s;chemes the King might
have built on the&s;e alliances, they were &s;oon fru&s;trated
by inte&s;tine commotions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1469.</NOTE> which engro&s;&s;ed all his atten|tion.
The&s;e di&s;orders probably aro&s;e not immediately
from the intrigues of the earl of Warwic, but from ac|cident,
a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the turbulent &s;pirit of the age, by the
general humour of di&s;content which that popular noble|man
had in&s;tilled into the nation, and perhaps by &s;ome
remains of attachment to the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter. The
ho&s;pital of St. Leonards near York,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrec|tion in York&s;hire.</NOTE> had received, from
an antient grant of King Athel&s;tane, a right of levying
a thrave of corn from every plough-land in the county;
and as the&s;e charitable e&s;tabli&s;hments are very liable to
abu&s;e, the country people complained, that the re|venue
of the ho&s;pital was no longer expended for the re|lief
of the poor, but was &s;ecreted by the managers, and
employed for their private purpo&s;es. After long repining
at the contribution, they refu&s;ed payment: Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
and civil cen&s;ures were i&s;&s;ued again&s;t them: Their goods
were di&s;trained, and their per&s;ons thrown into jail:
Till, as their ill-humour daily encrea&s;ed, they ro&s;e in
arms; fell upon the officers of the ho&s;pital, whom they
put to the &s;word; and proceeded in a body, fifteen thou|&s;and
&s;trong, to the gates of York<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 200. Holing&s;hed, p. 672. Polyd. Virg. p. 516.</NOTE>. The lord Montague,
who commanded in tho&s;e parts, oppo&s;ed him&s;elf to their
progre&s;s; and having been &s;o fortunate in a &s;kirmi&s;h as
to &s;eize Robert Hulderne their leader, he ordered him
immediately to be led to execution; according to the
barbarous and illegal practice of tho&s;e times<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 674.</NOTE>. The
rebels, however, &s;till continued in arms; and be|ing
&s;oon headed by men of greater di&s;tinction, Sir
Henry Nevil, &s;on of lord Latimer, and Sir John Co|niers,
<PB N="243" REF="259">
they advanced &s;outhwards, and began to appear
dangerous to the government. Herbert, earl of Pem|broke,
who had received that title on the forfeiture of
Ja&s;per Tudor, was ordered by Edward to march a|gain&s;t
them at the head of a body of Wel&s;hmen;
and he was joined by five thou&s;and archers under the
command of Stafford, earl of Devon&s;hire, who had &s;uc|cecded
in that title to the family of Courtney, which had
al&s;o been forfeited. But a trivial difference about quar|ters
having begot an animo&s;ity between the&s;e two noble|men,
the earl of Devon&s;hire retired with his archers, and
le&s;t Pembroke alone to encounter the rebels<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 221. Holing&s;hed, p. 672. Fragm. ad finem Sprotti.</NOTE>. The two
armies approached hear Banbury;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Banbury.</NOTE> and Pembroke, hav|ing
prevailed in a &s;kirmi&s;h, and having taken Sir
Henry Nevil pri&s;oner, ordered him immediately to be
put to death, without any form of proce&s;s. This
execution enraged, without terrifying, the rebels:
They attacked the Wel&s;h army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">26th July.</NOTE> routed them, put them
to the &s;word without mercy; and having &s;eized Pem|broke,
they took immediate revenge upon him for the
death of their leader<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 201, 202. Grafton, p. 676.</NOTE>. The King, imputing this mi&s;|fortune
to the earl of Devon&s;hire, who had de&s;erted Pem|broke,
ordered him to be executed in a like &s;ummary
manner. But the&s;e &s;peedy executions, or rather open
murders, did not &s;top there: The northern rebels, &s;end|ing
a party to Grafton, &s;eized the earl of Rivers and his
&s;on John; men who had become obnoxious by their near
relation to the King and his partiality towards them:

THERE is no part of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory &s;ince the Con|que&s;t,
&s;o ob&s;cure, &s;o uncertain, &s;o little authentic or
con&s;i&s;tent, as that of the wars, between the two Ro&s;es:
Hi&s;torians differ about many material circum&s;tances; &s;ome
events of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, in which they almo&s;t
all agree, are incredible and contradicted by records<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">We &s;hall give an in&s;tance: Almo&s;t all the hi&s;torians, even Co|mines, and the continuator of the annals of Croyland, a&s;&s;ert that Ed|ward was about this time taken pri&s;oner by Clarence and Warwic, and was committed to the cu&s;tody of the archbi&s;hop of York, brother to the earl; but being allowed to take the diver&s;ion of hunting by this pre|late, he made his e&s;cape, and afterwards chaced the rebels out of the kingdom. But that all the &s;tory is fal&s;e appears from Rymer, where we find, that the King, throughout all this period, continually exerci&s;ed his authority, and never was interrupted in his go|vernment. On the 7th of March 1470, he gives a commi&s;&s;ion of array to Clarence, whom he then imagined a good &s;ubject; and on the 23d of the &s;ame month, we find him i&s;&s;uing an order for apprehending him. Be&s;ides, in the King's manife&s;to again&s;t the duke and earl, (Clau&s;. 10. Edward IV. m. 7. 8.) where he enu|merates all their trea&s;ons, he mentions no &s;uch fact: He does not &s;o much as accu&s;e them of exciting young Welles's rebellion: He only &s;ays, that they exhorted him to continue in his rebellion. We may judge how &s;maller facts will be mi&s;repre&s;ented by hi&s;torians, who can in the mo&s;t material tran&s;actions mi&s;take &s;o gro&s;sly. There may even &s;ome &s;cruple ari&s;e with regard to the propo&s;als of marriage made to $ona of Savoy; tho' almo&s;t all the hi&s;torians concur in it, and the fact be very likely in it&s;elf&punc; For there are no traces in Rymer of any &s;uch emba&s;&s;y of Warwic's to France. The chief certainty in this and the preceding reign ari&s;es either from public records, or from the notice taken of certain pa&s;&s;ages by the French hi&s;torians. On the contrary, for &s;ome centuries after the Conque&s;t, the French hi&s;tory is not com|pleat without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Engli&s;h authors.</NOTE>;
and it is remarkable, that this profound darkne&s;s falls
upon us ju&s;t on the eve of the re&s;toration of letters, and
when the art of Printing was already known in Europe.
All we can di&s;tingui&s;h with certainty thro' the deep cloud,
which covers that period, is a &s;cene of horror and blood|&s;hed,
<PB N="245" REF="261">
&s;avage manners, arbitrary executions, and treache|rous
di&s;honourable conduct in all parties. There is no
po&s;&s;ibility, for in&s;tance, of accounting for the views and
intentions of the earl of Warwic at this time. It is
agreed, that he re&s;ided, with his &s;on-in-law, the duke
of Clarence, in his government of Calais, during the
commencement of this rebellion; and that his brother
Montague, acted with vigour again&s;t the northern rebels.
We may thence pre&s;ume, that the in&s;urrection had not
proceeded from the &s;ecret councils and in&s;tigation of
Warwic; tho' the murder, committed by the rebels,
on the earl of Rivers, his capital enemy, forms, on the
other hand, a violent pre&s;umption again&s;t him. He and
Clarence came over to England, offered their &s;ervice to
Edward, were received without any &s;u&s;picion, were en|tru&s;ted
by him in the highe&s;t commands<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. p. 647, 649, 650.</NOTE>, and &s;till per|&s;evered
in their fidelity. Soon after, we find the rebels
quieted and di&s;per&s;ed by a general pardon granted by Ed|ward
from the advice of the earl of Warwic: But why &s;o
courageous a prince, if &s;ecure of Warwic's fidelity, &s;hould
have granted a general pardon to men, who had been
guilty of &s;uch violent and per&s;onal outrages again&s;t him,
is not intelligible; nor why that nobleman, if unfaithful,
&s;hould have endeavoured to appea&s;e a rebellion, of which
he was able to make &s;uch advantages. But it appears,
that, after this in&s;urrection, there was an interval of
peace, during which the King loaded the family of Nevil
with honours and favours of the highe&s;t nature: He
made the lord Montague a marque&s;s, by the &s;ame name:
He created his &s;on, George, duke of Bedford<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cotton, p. 702.</NOTE>: He
declared publicly his intention of marrying that young
nobleman to his elde&s;t daughter, Elizabeth, who, as he
<PB N="246" REF="262">
had yet no &s;ons, was the pre&s;umptive heir of the crown:
Yet we find, that, &s;oon after, being invited to a fea&s;t
by the archbi&s;hop of York, a younger brother of War|wic
and Montague, he entertained a &s;udden &s;u&s;picion,
that they intended to &s;eize his per&s;on or to murder him:
And he abruptly departed from the entertainment<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Fragm. Ed. IV. ad fin. Sprotti.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOON after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1470.</NOTE> there broke out another rebellion, which
is as unaccountable as all the preceding events; chiefly
becau&s;e no &s;ufficient rea&s;on is a&s;&s;igned for it, and becau&s;e,
&s;o far as it appears, the family of Nevil had no hand in
exciting and fomenting it. It aro&s;e in Lincoln&s;hire,
and was headed by Sir Robert Welles, &s;on to the lord of
that name. The army of the rebels amounted to 30,000
men; but the lord Welles him&s;elf, far from giving coun|tenance
to them, fled into a &s;anctuary, in order to &s;e|cure
his per&s;on again&s;t the King's anger or &s;u&s;picions.
He was drawn from this retreat by a promi&s;e of &s;afety;
and was &s;oon after, notwith&s;tanding this a&s;&s;urance, be|headed,
along with Sir Thomas Dymoc, by orders from
Edward<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 204. Fabian, fol. 218. Habington, p. 442. Ho|ling&s;hed, p. 674.</NOTE>. The King fought a battle with the rebels,
defeated them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th March.</NOTE> took Sir Robert Welles and Sir Thomas
Launde pri&s;oners, and ordered them immediately to be
beheaded.</P>
<P>EDWARD, during the&s;e tran&s;actions, had &s;o little jea|lou&s;y
of the earl of Warwic or duke of Clarence, that
he granted them commi&s;&s;ions of array for levying forces
again&s;t the rebels<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. p. 652.</NOTE>: But the&s;e noblemen, &s;o &s;oon as they left the court, rai&s;ed troops in their own name, i&s;&s;ued
declarations again&s;t the government, and complained of
<PB N="247" REF="263">
grievances, oppre&s;&s;ions, and bad mini&s;ters. The unex|pected
defeat of Welles di&s;concerted all their mea&s;ures;
and they retired northwards into Lanca&s;hire, where they
expected to be joined by lord Stanley, who had married
the earl of Warwic's &s;i&s;ter. But as that nobleman
refu&s;ed all concurrence with them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Warwic and Cla|rence ba|ni&s;hed.</NOTE> and as lord Mon|tague
al&s;o remained quiet in York&s;hire; they were ob|liged
to di&s;&s;olve their army, and to fly into Devon&s;hire,
where they embarked and made &s;ail towards Calais<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">The King offered by proclamation a reward of 1000 pounds, or 100 pounds a year in land, to any that would &s;eize them.

<P>THE deputy governor, whom Warwic had left at
Calais, was one Vaucler, a Ga&s;con, who, &s;eeing the
earl return in this mi&s;erable condition, refu&s;ed him ad|mi&s;&s;ion
into the place; and would not &s;o much as per|mit
the dutche&s;s of Clarence to land, tho' a few days
before, &s;he had been delivered on &s;hip-board of a &s;on,
and was at that time extremely di&s;ordered by &s;ickne&s;s.
With difficulty, he would allow a few $laggons of wine
to be carried to the &s;hip for the u&s;e of the ladies: But
as he was a man of &s;agacity, and well acquainted with
the revolutions, to which England was &s;ubject, he &s;e|cretly
apologized to Warwic for this appearance of infi|delity,
and repre&s;ented it as proceeding entirely from
zeal for his &s;ervice. He &s;aid, that the place was ill &s;up|plied
with provi&s;ions; that he could not depend on the
attachment of the garri&s;on; that the inhabitants, who
lived by the Engli&s;h commerce, would certainly declare
for the e&s;tabli&s;hed government; that the place was at
pre&s;ent unable to re&s;i&s;t the power of England on the one
hand, and that of the duke of Burgundy on the other;
and that, by &s;eeming to declare for Edward, he would
acquire the confidence of that prince, and &s;till keep it in
<PB N="248" REF="264">
his power, when it &s;hould become &s;afe and prudent, to
re&s;tore the fortre&s;s to its ancient ma&s;ter<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 4. Hall, fol. 205.</NOTE>. It is uncer|tain,
whether Warwic was &s;atisfied with this apology,
or &s;u&s;pected a double infidelity in Vaucler; but he feign|ed
to be entirely convinced by him; and having &s;eized
&s;ome Flemi&s;h ve&s;&s;els which he found lying off Calais, he
immediately made &s;ail towards France.</P>
<P>THE King of France, unea&s;y at the clo&s;e conjunction
between Edward and the duke of Burgundy, received
with the greate&s;t demon&s;trations of regard and friend|ship
the unfortunate Warwic<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. p. 519.</NOTE>, with whom he had for|merly
maintained a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence, and whom he
hoped &s;till to make his in&s;trument in overturning the go|vernment
of England, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the hou&s;e of
Lanca&s;ter. No animo&s;ity was ever greater than that
which had long prevailed between that hou&s;e and the
earl of Warwic. His father had been executed by or|ders
from Margaret: He him&s;elf had twice reduced
Henry to captivity, had bani&s;hed the queen, had put to
death all their mo&s;t zealous partizans either in the field or
on the &s;caffold, and had occa&s;ioned innumerable ills to that
unhappy family. For this rea&s;on, believing that &s;uch
inveterate rancour would never admit of any cordial re|conciliation,
he had not mentioned Henry's name, when
he took arms again&s;t Edward; and he rather endea|voured
to prevail by means of his own adherents, than
revive a party, which he &s;incerely hated. But his pre|&s;ent
di&s;tre&s;&s;es and the entreaties of Lewis, made him
hearken to terms of accommodation; and Margaret be|ing
&s;ent for from Angers, where &s;he then re&s;ided, an
agreement was from common intere&s;t &s;oon formed be|tween
them. It was &s;tipulated, that Warwic &s;hould
<PB N="249" REF="265">
adopt the cau&s;e of Henry, and endeavour to re&s;tore him
to liberty and to re-e&s;tabli&s;h him on the throne; that the
admini&s;tration of the government, during the minority
of young Edward, Henry's &s;on, &s;hould re&s;ide conjointly
in the earl of Warwic and the duke of Clarence; that
prince Edward &s;hould marry the lady Anne, &s;econd
daughter of that nobleman; and that the crown, in ca&s;e
of the failure of male i&s;&s;ue in that prince, &s;hould de&s;cend
to the duke of Clarence, to the entire exclu&s;ion of
King Edward and his po&s;terity. Never was confederacy
on all &s;ides, le&s;s natural or more evidently the work of
nece&s;&s;ity: But Warwic hoped, that all former pa&s;&s;ions
of the Lanca&s;trians might be lo&s;t in pre&s;ent political
views; and that at wor&s;t, the independant power of his
family, and the affections of the people, would be able
to give him &s;ecurity, and enable him to exact the full
performance of all the conditions agreed on. The mar|riage
of prince Edward with the lady Anne was imme|diately
celebrated in France.</P>
<P>EDWARD rea&s;onably fore&s;aw, that it would be ea&s;y
to di&s;&s;olve an alliance, compo&s;ed of &s;uch di&s;cordant parts.
For this purpo&s;e, he &s;ent over a lady of great &s;agacity
and addre&s;s, who belonged to the train of the dutche&s;s of
Clarence, and who, under colour of attending her mi&s;|tre&s;s,
was empowered to negotiate with the duke, and
renew the connexions of that prince with his own fa|mily<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 5. Hall, fol. 207. Holing&s;hed, p. 675.</NOTE>.
She repre&s;ented to Clarence, that he had unwa|rily,
to his own ruin, become the in&s;trument of War|wic's
vengeance, and had thrown him&s;elf entirely in the
power of his mo&s;t inveterate enemies; that the mortal
injuries, which the one royal family had &s;uffered from
the other, were now pa&s;t all forgivene&s;s, and no idea of
an imaginary union in intere&s;ts could ever &s;uffice to
<PB N="250" REF="266">
obliterate them; that eyen if the leaders were willing
to forget pa&s;t offences, the animo&s;ity of their adherents
would prevent a &s;incere coalition of parties, and would, in
&s;pi$e of all temporary and verbal agreements, pre&s;erve an
eternal oppo&s;ition of mea&s;ures between them; and that a
prince, who de&s;erted his own kindred, and joined the
murderers of his father, left him&s;elf &s;ingle, without
friends, without protection, and would not, when mi&s;|fortunes
inevitably fell upon him, be &s;o much as entitled to
any pity or regard from the re&s;t of mankind. Clarence
was only one and twenty years of age, and &s;eems to
have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but a &s;lender capacity; yet he could ea&s;ily
&s;ee the force of the&s;e rea&s;ons; and on the promi&s;e of for|givene&s;s
from his brother, he &s;ecretly engaged, on a
favourable opportunity, to de&s;ert the earl of Warwic,
and abandon the Lanca&s;trian party.</P>
<P>DURING this negotiation, Warwic was &s;ecretly car|rying
on a corre&s;pondence of the &s;ame nature with his
brother, the marque&s;s of Montague, who was entirely
tru&s;ted by Edward; and like motives produced a like
re&s;olution in that nobleman. The marque&s;s al&s;o, that
he might render the projected blow the more deadly and
incurable, re&s;olved, on his &s;ide, to watch a favourable
opportunity for committing <HI>his</HI> perfidy, and &s;till to main|tain
the appearance of being a zealous adherent to the
hou&s;e of York.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e mutual &s;nares were thus carefully laid,
the deci&s;ion of the quarrel advanced apace. Lewis pre|pared
a fleet to e&s;cort the earl of Warwic, and offered
him a &s;upply of men and money<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 4. Hall, fol. 207.</NOTE>. The duke of Bur|gundy,
on the other hand, enraged at that nobleman for
his &s;eizure of the Flemi&s;h &s;hips before Calais, and anxi|ous
<PB N="251" REF="267">
to &s;upport the reigning family in England, with
whom his own intere&s;ts were now connected, fitted out a
larger fleet, with which he guarded the Channel; and
he ince&s;&s;antly warned his brother-in-law of the imminent
perils, to which he was expo&s;ed. But Edward, tho$ al|ways
brave and often active, had very little fore&s;ight or
penetration. He was not &s;en&s;ible of his danger: He
made no &s;uitable preparations again&s;t the earl of War|wic
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 687.</NOTE>: He even &s;aid, that the duke might &s;pare him&s;elf
the trouble of guarding the &s;eas, and that he wi&s;hed for
nothing more than to &s;ee Warwic &s;et foot on Engli&s;h
ground<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 5. Hall, fol. 208.</NOTE>. A vain confidence in his own prowe&s;s, joined
to the immoderate love of plea&s;ure, had made him inca|pable
of all &s;ound rea&s;on and reflection.</P>
<P>THE event &s;oon happened,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. Warwic and Cla|rence return.</NOTE> of which Edward &s;eemed
&s;o de&s;irous. A &s;torm di&s;per&s;ed the Flemi&s;h navy, and
left the &s;eas open to Warwic<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 5.</NOTE>. That nobleman &s;eized
the opportunity, and &s;etting &s;ail, quickly landed at Dart-mouth,
with the duke of Clarence, the earls of Oxford
and Pembroke, and a &s;mall body of troops; while the
King was in the north, engaged in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing an in&s;ur|rection,
which had been rai&s;ed by the lord Fitz-Hugh,
brother in law to Warwic. The &s;cene, which en&s;ues,
&s;eems more like the fiction of a poem or romance than
an event in true hi&s;tory. The prodigious popularity of
Warwic<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 205.</NOTE>, the zeal of the Lanca&s;trian party, the &s;pirit
of di&s;content with which many were infected, and the
general in&s;tability of the Engli&s;h nation, occa&s;ioned by
the late frequent revolutions, drew &s;uch multitudes to
his &s;tandard, that in a very few days his army amounted
to &s;ixty thou&s;and men, and was continually encrea&s;ing.
<PB N="252" REF="268">
Edward ha&s;tened &s;outhwards to encounter him; and the
two armies approached each other near Nottingham,
where a deci&s;ive action was every moment expected.
The rapidity of Warwic's progre&s;s had incapacitated
the duke of Clarence from executing <HI>his</HI> plan of treache|ry;
and the marque&s;s of Montague had here the oppor|tunity
of &s;triking the fir&s;t blow. He communicated the
de&s;ign to his adherents, who promi&s;ed him their concur|rence:
They took to arms in the night-time, and ha&s;ten|ed
with loud acclamations to Edward's quarters: The
King was alarmed at the noi&s;e, and &s;tarting from his
bed, heard the cry of war, u&s;ually employed by the
Lanca&s;trian party. Lord Ha&s;tings, his chamberlain, in|formed
him of the danger, and urged him to make his
e&s;cape by &s;peedy flight from an army, where he had &s;o
many concealed enemies, and where few &s;eemed to be
zealou&s;ly attached to his &s;ervice. He had ju&s;t time to
get on hor&s;eback, and to hurry with a &s;mall retinue to
Lynne, in Norfolk, where he luckily found &s;ome &s;hips
ready,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Edward IV. expel|led.</NOTE> on board which he pre&s;ently embarked<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 5. Hall, fol. 208.</NOTE>. And
after this manner, the earl of Warwic, in no longer &s;pace
than eleven days after his fir&s;t landing, was left entire
ma&s;ter of the kingdom.</P>
<P>BUT Edward's danger did not end with his embarka|tion.
The Ea&s;terlings or Han&s;e-Towns were then at
war both with France and England; and &s;ome &s;hips of
the&s;e people, hovering on the Engli&s;h coa&s;t, e&s;pied the
King's ve&s;&s;els, and gave chace to them; nor was it
without extreme difficulty, that he made his e&s;cape into
the port of Alcmaer in Holland. He had fled from
England with &s;uch precipitation, that he had carried no|thing
of value along with him; and the only reward,
<PB N="253" REF="269">
which he could be&s;tow on the captain of the ve&s;&s;el, that
brought him over, was a robe, lined with &s;ables; pro|mi&s;ing
him an ample recompence, if fortune &s;hould ever
become more propitious to him<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is not likely, that Edward could be very fond of
pre&s;enting him&s;elf in this lamentable condition before the
duke of Burgundy; and that having &s;o &s;uddenly, after
his mighty vaunts, lo&s;t all footing in his own kingdom
he could be in&s;en&s;ible to the ridicule, which mu&s;t attend
him in the eyes of that prince. The duke, on his part,
was no le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed how he &s;hould receive the de|throned
monarch. As he had ever borne a greater af|fection
to the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter than to that of York,
nothing but political views had engaged him to contract
an alliance with the latter family; and he fore&s;aw, that
probably the revolution in England would now turn this
alliance again&s;t him, and render the reigning family in
that kingdom, his implacable and jealous enemy. For
this rea&s;on, when the fir&s;t rumour of that event reached
him, attended with the circum&s;tance of Edward's death,
he &s;eemed rather plea&s;ed with the cata&s;trophe; and it was
no di&s;agreeable di&s;appointment to find, that he mu&s;t ei|ther
undergo the burthen of &s;upporting an exiled prince,
or the di&s;honour of abandoning &s;o near a relation<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. Habington, p. 445.</NOTE>. He
began already to &s;ay, that his connexions were with the
kingdom of England, not with the King; and that it
was indifferent to him, whether the name of Edward&punc; or
that of Henry was employed in the articles of treaty<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 6. Hall, fol. 211.</NOTE>.
The&s;e &s;entiments were continually &s;trengthened by the
&s;ub&s;equent events. Vaucler, the deputy governor of
Calais, tho' he had been confirmed in his command by
Edward, and even received an annual pen&s;ion from the
<PB N="254" REF="270">
duke of Burgundy on account of his fidelity to the
crown<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Gra$ton, p. 683.</NOTE>, no &s;ooner &s;aw his old ma&s;ter, Warwic, rein&s;tated
in authority, than he declared for him, and with great
demon&s;trations of zeal and attachment, put the whole
garri&s;on in his livery<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 6. Hall, fol. 211.</NOTE>. And the intelligence, which the
duke received every day from England, &s;eemed to pro|mi&s;e
an entire and full &s;ettlement in the family of Lan|ca&s;ter.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after Edward's flight had left the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Henry VI. re&s;tored.</NOTE>
kingdom at Warwic's di&s;po&s;al, that nobleman ha&s;tened to
London; and taking Henry from his confinement in
the Tower, into which he had been the chief cau&s;e of
throwing him, he proclaimed him King with great &s;o|lemnity.
A parliament was &s;ummoned in the name of
that prince to meet at We&s;tmin&s;ter; and as this a&s;|&s;embly
could pretend to no liberty amid&s;t &s;uch enraged
factions, governed by &s;uch an impetuous &s;pirit as War|wic,
their votes were entirely dictated by the ruling par|ty<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 691. Fabian, fol. 219. Polyd. Virg. p. 521.</NOTE>.
The treaty with Margaret was here fully exe|cuted:
Henry was recognized for lawful King; but his
incapacity for government being avowed, the regency
was entru&s;ted to Warwic and Clarence till the majority
of prince Edward; and in default of that prince's i&s;&s;ue,
Clarence was declared &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown. The u&s;ual
bu&s;ine&s;s al&s;o of rever&s;als went on without oppo&s;ition:
Every &s;tatute, made during the reign of Edward, was
repealed; that prince was declared to be an u&s;urper; he
and his adherents were attainted; and in particular,
Richard, duke of Gloce&s;ter, his younger brother: All
the attainders of the Lanca&s;trians, the dukes of Somer|&s;et
<PB N="255" REF="271">
and Exeter, the earls of Richmond, Pembroke, Ox|ford
and Ormond, were rever&s;ed; and every one was
re&s;tored, who had lo&s;t either honours or fortune, by his
former adherence to the cau&s;e of Henry.</P>
<P>THE ruling party were more &s;paring in their execu|tions,
than was u&s;ual after any revolution during tho&s;e
violent times. The only victim of di&s;tinction was John
Tibetot, earl of Worce&s;ter, con&s;table of England.
This accompli&s;hed per&s;on, born in an age and nation
where the nobility valued them&s;elves on ignorance as
their privilege, and left learning to monks and &s;chool|ma&s;ters,
for whom indeed the &s;purious erudition that
prevailed, was be&s;t fitted, had been &s;truck with the fir&s;t
rays of true &s;cience, which began to penetrate from the
&s;outh, and had been zealous, by his exhortations and
example, to propagate the love of letters among his un|poli&s;hed
countrymen. It is pretended, that knowledge
had not produced on this nobleman him&s;elf, the effect
which &s;o naturally attends it, of humanizing the temper,
and &s;oftening the heart<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 210. Stowe, p. 422.</NOTE>; and that he had enraged the
Lanca&s;trians again&s;t him, by the &s;everities which he ex|erci&s;ed
upon them, during the prevalence of his own
party. He endeavoured to conceal him&s;elf after the flight
of Edward; but was caught on the top of a tree in the
fore&s;t of Weybridge, was conducted to London, tried
before the earl of Oxford, condemned and executed.
All the other con&s;iderable Yorki&s;ts either fled beyond &s;ea,
or took &s;helter in &s;anctuaries; where the eccle&s;ia&s;tical
privileges afforded them protection. In London alone,
it is computed, that no le&s;s than 2000 per&s;ons &s;aved them|&s;elves
in this manner<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 7.</NOTE>; and among the re&s;t, Edward's
<PB N="256" REF="272">
Queen, who was there delivered of a &s;on, called by his
father's name<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 210. Stowe, p. 423. Holling&s;hed, p. 677. Graf|ton, p. 690.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>QUEEN Margaret, the other rival Queen, had not yet
appeared in England, but on receiving intelligence of
Warwic's &s;ucce&s;s, was preparing with prince Edward for
her journey. All the bani&s;hed Lanca&s;trians flocked to
her; and among the re&s;t, the duke of Somer&s;et, &s;on to
the duke beheaded after the battle of Hexham. This
nobleman, who had long been regarded as the head of
the party, had fled into the Low Countries on the di&s;|comfiture
of his friends; and as he concealed his name
and quality, he had langui&s;hed in the mo&s;t extreme want
and indigence. Philip de Comines tells us<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Liv. 3. chap. 4.</NOTE>, that he him|&s;elf
there &s;aw him, as well as the duke of Exeter, in a
condition no better than that of the meane&s;t beggar;
till being di&s;covered by Philip duke of Burgundy, they
had &s;mall pen&s;ions allotted them, and were living in
$lence and ob&s;curity, when the &s;ucce&s;s of their party
called them from their retreat. But both Somer&s;et and
Margaret were detained by contrary winds, from reaching
England<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 692. Polyd. Virg. p. 522.</NOTE>, till a new revolution in that kingdom, no le&s;s
&s;udden and &s;urpri&s;ing than the former, threw them into
greater mi&s;ery than that from which they had ju&s;t emerged.</P>
<P>THO' the duke of Burgundy, by neglecting Edward,
and paying court to the e&s;tabli&s;hed government, had
endeavoured to conciliate the friend&s;hip of the Lanca&s;tri|ans,
he found that he had not &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h; and
the antient connexions between the King of France,
and the earl of Warwic, &s;till held him in great doubt
and anxiety<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 205.</NOTE>. This nobleman, too ha&s;tily regarding
<PB N="257" REF="273">
Charles as his determined enemy, had &s;ent over to Calais
a body of 4000 men, who committed inroads on the
Low-Countries<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 6.</NOTE>; and the duke of Burgundy &s;aw him|&s;elf
in danger of being oppre&s;&s;ed by the united arms of
France and of England. He re&s;olved therefore to grant
&s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his brother-in-law; but in &s;uch a co|vert
manner, as &s;hould give the lea&s;t offence po&s;&s;ible to
the government of England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1471.</NOTE> He equipped four large
ve&s;&s;els, in the name of &s;ome private merchants, at
Terveer in Zealand; and cau&s;ing fourteen &s;hips to be
&s;ecretly hired of the Ea&s;terlings, he delivered this &s;mall
&s;quadron to Edward, who, receiving al&s;o a &s;um of money
from the duke, immediately &s;et &s;ail for England. No
&s;ooner was Charles informed of his departure, than he
i&s;&s;ued a proclamation inhibiting all his &s;ubjects to give
him countenance or a&s;&s;i&s;tance<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>; an artifice which could
not blind the earl of Warwic, but which might &s;erve as
a decent pretence, if he was &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, for maintaining
friendship with the hou&s;e of Burgundy.</P>
<P>EDWARD, impatient to take revenge of his enemies,
and to recover his lo&s;t authority, made an attempt
to land with his forces, which exceeded not 2000
men, on the coa&s;t of Norfolk; but being there repul&s;ed<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Holling&s;hed, p. 679.</NOTE>,
he &s;ailed northwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25 March. Edward IV. re|turns.</NOTE> and di&s;embarked at Raven&s;pur in
York&s;hire. Finding, that the new magi&s;trates, who
had been placed in authority by the earl of Warwic,
kept the people every where from joining him, he pre|tended,
and even made oath, that he came not to chal|lenge
the crown, but only the inheritance of the hou&s;e
of York, which of right belonged to him, and that he
did not intend to rai&s;e a civil war in the kingdom<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 214. Habington, p. 447. Holling&s;hed, p. 679. Grafton, p. 698. Fabian, fol. 219.</NOTE>. His
<PB N="258" REF="274">
partizans every moment flocked to his &s;tandard: He was
admitted into the city of York<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. p. 524. Leland's collect. vol. ii. p. 504.</NOTE>: And he was &s;oon in a
&s;ituation, which gave him hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in all his
claims and preten&s;ions. The marquis of Montague com|manded
in the northern counties; but from froe my&s;te|rious
rea&s;ons, which, as well as many other important
tran&s;actions in that age, no hi&s;torian has cleared up, he
totally neglected the beginnings of an in&s;urretion,
which he ought to have e&s;teemed &s;o formidable<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 215. Habington, p. 447. Holling&s;hed, p. 680. Polyd. Virg. p. 524.</NOTE>. War|wic
a&s;&s;embled an army at Leice&s;ter, with an intention
of meeting and of giving battle to the enemy; but
Edward, by taking another road, pa&s;&s;ed him unmole&s;ted,
and pre&s;ented him&s;elf before the gates of London. Had
he here been refu&s;ed admittance, he was totally ruin|ed:
But there were many cau&s;es, which inclined the
citizens to favour him. His numerous friends, i&s;&s;u|ing
forth from their &s;anctuaries, were active in his
cau&s;e; many rich merchants, who had formerly lent
him money, &s;aw no other chance for their payment
but his re&s;toration; the city-dames, who had been li|beral
of their favours to him, and who &s;till retained an
affection for this young and gallant prince, &s;wayed their
hu&s;bands and friends in his behalf<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 7.</NOTE>; and above all,
the archbi&s;hop of York, Warwic's brother, to whom
the care of the city was committed, had &s;ecretly, from
unknown rea&s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th April.</NOTE> entered into a corre&s;pondence with
him, and he facilitated Edward's admi&s;&s;ion into London.
The mo&s;t likely cau&s;e, which can be a&s;&s;igned for tho&s;e
multiplied infidelities, even in the family it&s;elf of Nevil, is
the &s;pirit of faction, which, when it becomes inve|terate,
it is very difficult for any man entirely to &s;hake
<PB N="259" REF="275">
off. The&s;e per&s;ons, who had long di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves
in the York party, were unable to act with zeal
and cordiality for the &s;upport of the Lanca&s;trians; and
they were inclined, by every pro&s;pect of favour or ac|commodation,
offered them by Edward, to return to
their antient connexions. However this may be, Ed|ward's
entrance into London, made him ma&s;ter not only
of that rich and powerful city, but al&s;o of the per&s;on of
Henry, who, de&s;tined to be the perpetual &s;port of for|tune,
thus fell again into the hands of his enemies<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 702.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT appears not, that Warwic, during his &s;hort admi|ni&s;tration,
which had continued only &s;ix months, had
been guilty of any unpopular acts, or had any wi&s;e de|&s;erved
to forfeit that general favour, with which he had
&s;o lately overwhelmed Edward. But this prince, who
was formerly the defendant, was now the aggre&s;&s;or;
and having overcome the difficulties, which always at|tend
the beginnings of an in&s;urrection, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many
advantages above his enemy: His partizans were actuated
by that zeal and courage, which the notion of an attack
in&s;pires; his opponents were intimidated for a like rea|&s;on;
every one, who had been di&s;appointed in the hopes,
which he had entertained from Warwic's elevation, either
became a cool friend, or an open enemy to that noble|man;
and each malecontent, from whatever cau&s;e, proved
an acce&s;&s;ion to Edward's army. The King, therefore,
found him&s;elf in a condition to face the earl of War|wic,
who, being reinforced by his &s;on-in-law, the duke
of Clarence, and his brother the marquis of Montague,
took po&s;t at Barnet, in the neighbourhood of London.
The arrival of Queen Margaret was every day expected,
who would have drawn together all the true Lanca&s;tri|ans,
and have brought a mighty acce&s;&s;ion to Warwic's
<PB N="260" REF="276">
forces&punc; But this very con&s;ideration proved a motive to
the earl rather to hurry on a deci&s;ive action, than to
&s;hare the victory with rivals and antient enemies, who,
he fore&s;aw, would, in ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s, claim the chief
merit in the enterprize<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 7.</NOTE>. But while his jealou&s;y was
all directed towards that &s;ide, he overlooked the danger|ous
infidelity of friends, who lay the neare&s;t to his bo|&s;om.
His brother, Montague, who had lately tempo|rized,
&s;eems now to have remained &s;incerely attached to
the intere&s;ts of his family: But his &s;on-in-law, tho'
bound to him by every tye of honour and gratitude, tho'
he &s;hared the power of the regency, tho' he had been in|ve&s;ted
by Warwic in all the honours and patrimony of
the hou&s;e of York, re&s;olved to fulfil the &s;ecret engage|ments,
which he had formerly taken with his brother,
and to &s;upport the interests of his own family: He de|ferted
to the King in the night-time, and carried over a
body of 12,000 men along with him<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Grafton, p. 700. Comines, liv. 3. chap. 7. Leland's Collect. vol. ii. p. 505.</NOTE>. Warwic was
now too far advanced to retreat; and as he rejected with
di&s;dain all terms of peace offered him by Edward and
Clarence, he was obliged to hazard a general engage|ment.
The battle was fought with great ob&s;tinacy on<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th April.</NOTE>
both &s;ides:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Barnet, and death of Warwic.</NOTE> The two armies, in imitation of their lead|ers,
exerted uncommon acts of valour: And the victory
remained long undecided between them. But an acci|dent
threw at la&s;t the balance to the &s;ide of the Yorki&s;ts.
Edward's cogni&s;ance was a &s;un; that of Warwic a &s;tar
with rays; and the mi&s;tine&s;s of the morning rendering
it difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h them, John earl of Oxford, who
fought on the &s;ide of the Lanca&s;trians, was, by mi&s;take,
attacked by his friends, and chaced off the field of battle<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Habington, p. 449.</NOTE>.
<PB N="261" REF="277">
Warwic, contrary to his more u&s;ual practice, engaged
that day on foot, re&s;olving to &s;how his army, that he
meant to &s;hare every fortune with them, and he was
&s;lain in the thicke&s;t of the engagement<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 7.</NOTE>: His brother
underwent the &s;ame fate: And as Edward had i&s;&s;ued or|ders
not to give any quarter, a great and undi&s;tingui&s;hed
&s;laughter was made in the pur&s;uit<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 218.</NOTE>. There fell about
1500 on the &s;ide of the conquerors.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame day that this deci&s;ive battle was fought<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Leland's Collect. vol. ii. p. 505.</NOTE>,
Queen Margaret and her &s;on, now about eighteen years
of age, and a very promi&s;ing youth, arrived at Wey|mouth,
&s;upported by a &s;mall body of French forces.
When this prince&s;s received intelligence of her hu&s;band's
captivity, and of the defeat and death of the earl of
Warwic, her courage, which had &s;upported her under
&s;o many di&s;a&s;trous events, here quite left her; and &s;he
immediately fore&s;aw all the di&s;mal con&s;equences of this
calamity. She took &s;anctuary at fir&s;t in the abbey of
Beaulieu<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 219. Habington, p. 451. Grafton, p. 706. Polyd. Virg. p. 528.</NOTE>; but being encouraged by the appearance of
Tudor, earl of Pembroke, and Courtney, earl of Devon|&s;hire,
of the lords Wenloc and St. John, with other
men of rank, who exhorted her &s;till to hope for &s;ucce&s;s,
&s;he re&s;umed her former &s;pirit, and determined to defend
to the utmo&s;t the ruins of her fallen fortunes. She ad|vanced
thro' the counties of Devon, Somer&s;et, and Glo|ce&s;ter,
encrea&s;ing her army on each day's march; but
was at la&s;t overtaken by the rapid and expeditious Ed|ward,
at Teuke&s;|bury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Teuke&s;bury.</NOTE> on the banks of the Severne.
The Lanca&s;trians were here totally defeated: The earl
of Devon&s;hire and lord Wenloc were killed in the field:<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th May.</NOTE>
<PB N="262" REF="278">
The duke of Somer&s;et, and about twenty other per&s;ons
of di&s;tinction, having taken &s;helter in a church, were
&s;urrounded, dragged out, and immediately beheaded:
About 3000 of their &s;ide fell in battle: And the army
was entirely di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>QUEEN Margaret and her &s;on were taken pri&s;oners,
and brought to the King, who a&s;ked the prince, after an
in&s;ulting manner, how he dared to invade his dominions?
The young prince, more mindful of his high birth than
of his pre&s;ent fortune, replied, that he came thither to
claim his ju&s;t inheritance. The ungenerous Edward,
in&s;en&s;ible to pity, &s;truck him on the face with his gaunt|let;
and the dukes of Clarence and Gloce&s;ter, lord
Ha&s;tings and Sir Thomas Gray, taking the blow as a
&s;ignal for farther violence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of prince Ed|ward.</NOTE> hurried the prince into the

which that prince's memory deservedly labours, inclined
perhaps the nation to aggravate his crimes without any
&s;ufficient authority. It is certain, however, that Hen|ry's
death was very &s;udden; and tho' he laboured before
under an ill &s;tate of health, this circum&s;tance, joined to
the general manners of the age, gave a very natural
ground of &s;u&s;picion; which was rather increa&s;ed than

<P>ALL the hopes of the Lanca&s;trians &s;eemed now to be
utterly extingui&s;hed. Every legitimate prince of that
family was dead: Almo&s;t all the great leaders of the
party had peri&s;hed in battle or on the &s;caffold: Ja&s;per,
earl of Pembroke, who was levying forces in Wales,
di&s;per&s;ed his army, when he received intelligence of the
battle of Teuke&s;bury; and he fled into Brittany with
his nephew, the young earl of Richmond<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Habington, p. 454. Polyd. Virg. p. 531.</NOTE>. The ba&s;tard

to re&s;i&s;t the allurements of a pro&s;oerpus fortune;
and he wholly devoted him&s;elf, as before, to plea&s;ure and

his &s;ubjects, and to re&s;tore the &s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition, which

<P>BUT while the King was thus indulging him&s;elf in
plea&s;ure, he was rouzed from the lethargy by a pro&s;pect
of foreign conque&s;ts, which, it is probable, his de&s;ire
of popularity, more than the &s;pirit of ambition, had
made him covet. Tho' he deemed him&s;elf very little be|holden
to the duke of Burgundy, for the reception which
that prince had given him during his exile<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 7.</NOTE>, the politi|cal
intere&s;ts of their &s;tates maintained &s;till a clo&s;e con|nexion
between them; and they agreed to unite their
arms in making a powerful inva&s;ion on France. A league
was formed, in which Edward &s;tipulated to pa&s;s the &s;eas
with an army, exceeding 10,000 men, and to invade the
French territories: Charles promi&s;ed to join him with all
his forces: The King was to challenge the crown of
France, and to obtain at lea&s;t the provinces of Nor|mandy
and Guienne: The duke was to acquire Cham|paigne
and &s;ome other territories, and to free all his do|minions
from the burthen of homage to the crown of
France: And neither party was to make peace without
the con&s;ent of the other<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. P. 806, 807, 808, &amp;c.</NOTE>. They were the more encour|aged
to hope for &s;ucce&s;s from this league, as the count de
St. Pol, con&s;table of France, who was ma&s;ter of St.
Quintin, and &s;ome towns on the Somme, had &s;ecretly
promi&s;ed them his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and there were al&s;o hopes
of engaging the duke of Brittany to enter into the con|federacy.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="281">
THE pro&s;pect of a French war was always a &s;ure
means of making the parliament open their pur&s;es, as
far as the habits of that age would permit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1474.</NOTE> They voted
the King a tenth of rents, or two &s;hillings in the pound;
which mu&s;t have been very inaccurately levied, &s;ince it

was not to be put into the King's hands, but to be kept
in religious hou&s;es; and if the expedition into France
did not take place, it was immediately to be refunded to
the people. After the&s;e grants, the parliament was di&s;|&s;olved,
which had &s;at near two years and a half, and
had undergone &s;everal prorogations; a practice not very
u&s;ual at that time in England.</P>
<P>THE King pa&s;&s;ed over to Calais with an army of<NOTE PLACE="marg">1475.</NOTE>
1500 men at arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion of France.</NOTE> and 15000 archers; attended with
all the chief nobility of England, who, progno&s;ticating
future &s;ucce&s;&s;es from the pa&s;t, were eager to appear in
this great theatre of honour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 4. chap. 5. This author &s;ays, (chap.

But all their &s;anguine
<PB N="266" REF="282">
hopes were damped, when they found, on entering the
French territories, that neither the con&s;table opened his
gates to them, nor did the duke of Burgundy bring them
the &s;malle&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance. That prince, tran&s;ported by his
ardent temper, had carried all his armies to a great di|&s;tance,
and had employed them in wars on the frontiers
of Germany, and again&s;t the duke of Lorrain; and tho'
he came in per&s;on to Edward, and endeavoured to apo|logize
for this breach of treaty, there was no pro&s;pect
that they would be able this campaign to make a con|junction
with the Engli&s;h. This circum&s;tance gave
great di&s;gu&s;t to the King, and inclined him to hearken
to tho&s;e advances, which Lewis continually made him for
an accommodation.</P>
<P>THAT monarch, more &s;wayed by political views than
by the point of honour, deemed no &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions too mean,
which, could free him from enemies, who had proved
&s;o formidable to his predece&s;&s;ors, and who, united to
&s;o many other enemies, might &s;till &s;hake the well|e&s;tabli&s;hed
government of France. It appears from
Comines, that di&s;cipline was, at this time, very im|perfect
among the Engli&s;h; and that their civil wars,
tho' long continued, yet, being always decided by ha&s;ty
battles, had &s;till left them ignorant of the improvements,
which the military art was beginning to receive upon the
continent<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 4. chap. 5.</NOTE>. But as Lewis was &s;en&s;ible, that the war|like
genius of the people would &s;oon render them ex|cellent
&s;oldiers, he was far from de&s;pi&s;ing them for their
pre&s;ent want of experience; and he employed all his
art to detach them from their alliance with Bur|gundy.
When Edward &s;ent a herald to claim the
crown of France, and to carry him a defiance in
ca&s;e of refu&s;al; &s;o far from an&s;wering to this bravade in
<PB N="267" REF="283">
like haughty terms, he relied with great temper, and
even made the herald a considerable pre&s;ent<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 4. chap. 5. Hall, fol. 227.</NOTE>: He took
afterwards an opportunity of &s;ending a herald to the
Engli&s;h camp; and giving him directions to apply to
the lords Stanley and Howard, who, he heard, were
friends to peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th Au|gu&s;t.</NOTE> he de&s;ired the good offices of the&s;e
noblemen in promoting an accommodation with their
ma&s;ter<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 4. chap. 7.</NOTE>. As Edward was now fallen into like di&s;po|&s;itions,
a truce was &s;oon concluded on terms more ad|vantageous
than honourable to Lewis. He &s;tipulated to
pay Edward immediately 75,000 crowns, on condition
that he &s;hould withdraw his army from France, and
promi&s;ed to pay him 50,000 crowns a year during
their joint lives:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace of Pecquigni.</NOTE> It was added, that the Dauphin, when
of age, &s;hould marry Edward's elde&s;t daughter<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xii. p. $7.</NOTE>. In
order to ratify this treaty, the two monarchs agreed to
have a per&s;onal interview; and for this purpo&s;e, &s;uitable
preparations were made at Pecquigni near Amiens: A
clo&s;e rail was drawn acro&s;s a bridge in that place, with
no larger intervals than would allow the arm to pa&s;s;
a precaution which was u&s;ed to prevent a like accident
with that which happened to John Duke of Burgundy
in his conference with the Dauphin at Montereau. Ed|ward
and Lewis came to the oppo&s;ite &s;ides; conferred
privately together; and having confirmed their friend|&s;hip,
and interchanged many mutual civilities, they &s;oon
after parted<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 4. chap. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LEWIS was anxious not only to gain the King's
friend&s;hip; but al&s;o that of the nation, and of all the
con&s;iderable per&s;ons in the Engli&s;h court. He be&s;towed
pen&s;ions, to the amount of 16,000 crowns a year, on &s;e|veral
of the King's favourites; on lord Ha&s;tings two
<PB N="268" REF="284">
thou&s;and crowns; on lord Howard and others in pro|portion;
and the&s;e great mini&s;ters were not a&s;hamed
thus to receive wages from a foreign prince<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 235.</NOTE>. As the
two armies, after the conclu&s;ion of the truce, remained
&s;ome time in the neighbourhood of each other, the Eng|li&s;h
were not only admitted freely into Amiens, where
Lewis re&s;ided, but had al&s;o all their charges defrayed,
and had wine and victuals furni&s;hed them in every inn,
without any payments being demanded. They flocked
thither in &s;uch multitudes, that once above nine thou|&s;and
of them were in the town, and they might have
made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the King's per&s;on; but
Lewis, concluding from their carele&s;s and di&s;&s;olute man|ner
of living, that they had no bad intentions, was care|ful
not to betray the lea&s;t &s;igns of fear or jealou&s;y. And
when Edward, informed of this di&s;order, de&s;ired him to
&s;hut the gates again&s;t them; he replied, that he would
never agree to exclude the Engli&s;h from the place where
he re&s;ided; but Edward, if he plea&s;ed, might recall
them, and place his own officers at the gates of Amiens
to prevent their returning<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 4. chap. 9. Hall, fol. 233.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LEWIS'S de&s;ire of confirming a mutual amity with
England, engaged him even to make imprudent ad|vances,
which co&s;t him afterwards &s;ome pains to evade.
In the conference at Pecquigni, he had &s;aid to Edward,
that he wi&s;hed to have a vi&s;it from him at Paris; that he
would there endeavour to amu&s;e him with the ladies;
and that, in ca&s;e any offences were then committed,
he would a&s;&s;ign him the cardinal of Bourbon for con|fe&s;&s;or,
who, from fellow-feeling, would not be over and
above &s;evere in the penances, which he would injoin.
This hint made deeper impre&s;&s;ions than Lewis intended.
<PB N="269" REF="285">
Lord Howard, who accompanied him back to Amiens,
told him, in confidence, that, if he was &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, it
would not be impo&s;&s;ible to per&s;uade Edward to take a
journey with him to Paris, where they might make merry
together. Lewis pretended at fir&s;t not to hear this offer;
but his Howard's repeating it, he expre&s;&s;ed his concern,
that his wars with the duke of Burgundy would not
permit him to attend his royal gue&s;t, and do him the ho|nours
he intended, &startq;Edward,&endq; &s;aid he, privately to Co|mines,
&startq;is a very hand&s;ome and a very amorous prince:
Some lady at Paris may like him as well as he &s;hall
do her; and may invite him to return in another man|ner.
It is better that the &s;ea &s;hould be between us<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 4. chap. 10. Habington, p. 469.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS treaty did very little honour to either of the&s;e
monarchs: It di&s;covered the imprudence of Edward,
who had taken his mea&s;ures &s;o ill with his allies, as to
be obliged, after &s;uch expen&s;ive preparations, to return
without making any acqui&s;itions, equivalent to them:
It &s;howed the want of dignity in Lewis, who, rather
than run the hazard of a battle, agreed to &s;ubject his
kingdom to a tribute, and thus acknowledge the &s;upe|riority
of a neighbouring prince, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much le&s;s
power and territory than him&s;elf. But as Lewis made
intere&s;t the &s;ole te&s;t of honour, he thought, that all the
advantages of the treaty were on his &s;ide, and that he
had over-reached Edward by &s;ending him out of France
on &s;uch ea&s;y terms. For this rea&s;on, he was very &s;olicitous
to conceal his triumph; and he &s;trictly enjoined his cour|tiers
never to &s;how the Engli&s;h the lea&s;t &s;ign of mockery or
ridicule again&s;t them. But he did not him&s;elf very care|fully
ob&s;erve &s;o prudent a rule: He could not forbear,
one day, in the joy of his heart, throwing out &s;ome
raillery on the ea&s;y &s;implicity of Edward and his coun|cil:
<PB N="270" REF="286">
When he perceived, that he was overheard by a
Ga&s;con, who had &s;ettled in England. He was imme|diately
&s;en&s;ible of the blunder; &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the
gentleman; and offered him &s;uch advantages in his own
country, as engaged him to remain in France. <HI>It is
but ju&s;t,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that I pay the penalty of my talkativene&s;s</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 3. chap. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t honourable part of Lewis's treaty with
Edward was the &s;tipulation for the liberty of Queen
Margaret, who, tho' after the death of her hu&s;band and
&s;on, &s;he could no longer be formidable to the govern|ment,
was &s;till detained in cu&s;tody by Edward. Lewis
paid fifty thou&s;and crowns for her ran&s;om; and that
prince&s;s, who had been &s;o active in the &s;tage of the
world, and who had experienced &s;uch a variety of
fortune, pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of her days in tranquility
and privacy, till the year 1482, when &s;he died: An
admirable prince&s;s, but more illu&s;trious by her undaunted
&s;pirit in adver&s;ity, than by her moderation in pro&s;perity.
She &s;eems neither to have enjoyed the virtues, nor been
&s;ubject to the weakne&s;&s;es of her &s;ex; and was as much
tainted with the ferocity, as endowed with the courage,
of that barbarous age in which &s;he lived.</P>
<P>THO' Edward had &s;o little rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied with
the conduct of the duke of Burgundy, he re&s;erved to
that prince a power of acceding to the treaty of Amiens:
But Charles, when the offer was made him, haughtily
replied, that he was able to &s;upport him&s;elf without the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of England, and that he would make no peace
with Lewis, till three months after Edward's return into
his own country. This prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the ambi|tion
and courage of a conqueror; but being defective in
policy and prudence, qualities no le&s;s e&s;&s;ential, he was
<PB N="271" REF="287">
unfortunate in all his enterprizes; and peri&s;hed at la&s;t
in battle again&s;t the Swi&s;s<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Comines, liv. 5. chap. 8.</NOTE>; a people, whom he de|&s;pi&s;ed,
and who, tho' brave and free, had hitherto been
in a manner overlooked in the general &s;y&s;tem of Europe.
This event,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1477.</NOTE> which happened in the year 1477, produced
a great alteration in the views of all the princes, and was
attended with con&s;equences which were felt for many
generations. Charles left only one daughter, Mary, by
his fir&s;t wife; and this prince&s;s being heir of his opulent
and exten&s;ive dominions, was courted by all the poten|tates
of Chri&s;tendom, who contended with each other
for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o rich a prize. Lewis, the head of
her family, might, by a proper application, have ob|tained
this match for the Dauphin, and have thereby
united to the clown of France all the provinces of the
Low Countries, together with Burgundy, Artois, and
Picardy; which would at once have rendered his king|dom
an overmatch for all his neighbours. But a man
wholly intere&s;ted is as rare as one entirely endowed with
the oppo&s;ite virtue; and Lewis, though impregnable to
all the &s;entiments of genero&s;ity and friend&s;hip, was,
on this occa&s;ion, carried from the road of true po|licy
by the pa&s;&s;ions of animo&s;ity and revenge. He had
imbibed &s;o deep a hatred of the hou&s;e of Burgundy, that
he cho&s;e rather to &s;ubdue the prince&s;s by force of arms,
than unite her to his family by marriage: He con|quered
the dutchy of Burgundy and that part of Pi|cardy,
which had been ceded to Philip the Good by the
treaty of Arras: But he forced the &s;tates of the Nether|lands
to be&s;tow their &s;overeign in marriage on Maxi|milian
of Au&s;tria, &s;on to the emperor, Frederic, from
whom they looked for protection in their pre&s;ent di|&s;tre&s;&s;es:
<PB N="272" REF="288">
And by the&s;e means, France lo&s;t the opportu|nity,
which &s;he never could recover, of making that im|portant
acqui&s;ition of power and territory.</P>
<P>DURING this intere&s;ting cri&s;is, Edward was no le&s;s
defective in policy, and was no le&s;s actuated by private
pa&s;&s;ions, unworthy of a &s;overeign and a &s;tate&s;man. Jea|lou&s;y
of his brother, Clarence, had cau&s;ed him to neglect
the advances which were made of marrying that prince,
now a widower, to the heire&s;s of Burgundy<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. Hall, fol. 240. Holing&s;hed, p. 703. Habington, p. 474. Grafton, p. 742.</NOTE>; and he
&s;ent her propo&s;als of e&s;pou&s;ing Anthony earl of Ri|vers,
brother to his queen, who &s;till retained an entire
a&s;cendant over him. But the match was rejected with
di&s;dain<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 240.</NOTE>; and Edward re&s;enting this treatment of his
brother-in-law, permitted Lewis to proceed without in|terruption
in his conque&s;ts over that defencele&s;s ally.
Any pretence &s;ufficed him for giving him&s;elf up entirely
to indolence and plea&s;ure, which were now become his
ruling pa&s;&s;ions. The only object, which divided his
attention, was the improving the revenues of the crown,
which had been extremely dilapidated by the nece&s;&s;ities
or negligence of his predece&s;&s;ors; and &s;ome of his expe|dients
for that purpo&s;e, tho' unknown to us, were deem|ed,
during the time, oppre&s;&s;ive to the people<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 241. Hi&s;t. Croyl, cont. p. 559.</NOTE>. The
detail of private wrongs naturally e&s;capes the notice of
hi&s;tory; but an act of tyranny, of which Edward was
guilty in his own family, has been taken notice of by all
hi&s;torians, and has met with very general and de&s;erved
cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE duke of Clarence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial and execution of the duke of Clarence.</NOTE> by all his &s;ervices in de&s;erting
Warwic, had never been able to recover the King's
friend&s;hip, which he had forfeited by his former confede|racy
<PB N="273" REF="289">
with that nobleman. He was &s;till regarded at
court as a man of a dangerous and a fickle character; and
the imprudent openne&s;s and violence of his temper, tho'
it rendered him much le&s;s dangerous, tended extremely
to multiply his enemies, and to enrage them again&s;t him.
Among the&s;e, he had had the misfortune to give di&s;|plea&s;ure
to the queen her&s;elf, as well as to his brother,
the duke of Gloce&s;ter, a prince of the deepe&s;t policy, of
the mo&s;t unrelenting ambition, and the lea&s;t &s;crupulous
in the means which he employed for the attainment of
his pernicious purpo&s;es. A combination between the&s;e
potent adver&s;aries being &s;ecretly formed again&s;t Clarence,
it was determined to begin with attacking his friends;
in hopes, that, if he patiently endured this injury, his
pu&s;illanimity would di&s;honour him in the eyes of the
public; if he made re&s;i&s;tance and expre&s;&s;ed re&s;entment,
his pa&s;&s;ion would betray him into mea&s;ures, which might
give them advantages again&s;t him. The King, hunting
one day in the park of Thomas Burdet of Arrow, in
Warwick&s;hire, had killed a white buck, which was a
great favourite of the owner; and Burdet, vexed at the
lo&s;s, broke into a pa&s;&s;ion, and wi&s;hed the horns of the
deer in the belly of the per&s;on who had advi&s;ed the King
to commit that in&s;ult upon him. This natural expre&s;&s;ion
of re&s;entment, which would have been overlooked or
forgotten, had it come from any other per&s;on, was ren|dered
criminal and capital in that gentleman, by the
friendship in which he had the misfortune to live with
the duke of Clarence: He was tried for his life; the
judges and jury were found &s;ervile enough to condemn
him; and he was publickly beheaded at Tyburn for
this pretended offence<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Habington, p. 475. Holing&s;hed, p. 703. Sir Thomas More in Kennet, p. 498.</NOTE>. About the &s;ame time, one
<PB N="274" REF="290">
John Stacey, an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, much connected with the
duke, as well as with Burdet, was expo&s;ed to a like
iniquitous and barbarous per&s;ecution. This per&s;on, be|ing
more learned in mathematics and a&s;tronomy than was
u&s;ual in that age, lay under the reproach of necromancy
with the ignorant vulgar; and the tyrannical court laid
hold of this popular rumour to effect his de&s;truction.
He was tried in a court of ju&s;tice for that imaginary
crime; many of the greate&s;t peers countenanced the pro|&s;ecution
by their pre&s;ence; he was condemned, put to
the torture, and executed<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Croyl. Cont. p. 561.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Clarence was alarmed, when he found
the&s;e acts of tyranny exerci&s;ed on all around him: He
reflected on the fate of the good duke of Gloce&s;ter in
the la&s;t reign, who, after &s;eeing the mo&s;t infamous pre|tences
employed for the de&s;truction of his neare&s;t con|nections,
at la&s;t fell him&s;elf a victim to the vengeance of
his enemies. But Clarence, in&s;tead of &s;ecuring his own
life again&s;t the pre&s;ent danger, by &s;ilence and re&s;erve,
was open and loud in ju&s;tifying the innocence of his
friends, and in exclaiming again&s;t the iniquity of their
per&s;ecutors. The King, highly offended with his liberty,
or u&s;ing that pretence again&s;t him, committed him to the
Tower<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 562.</NOTE>, &s;ummoned a parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1478.</NOTE> and tried him for his
life before the hou&s;e of peers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th Jan.</NOTE> the &s;upreme tribunal of
the nation.</P>
<P>THE duke was accu&s;ed of arraigning public ju&s;tice,
by maintaining the innocence of men, who had been
condemned in courts of judicature, and of inveighing
again&s;t the iniquity of the King, who had given orders
for their pro&s;ecution<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 430.</NOTE>. Many ra&s;h expre&s;&s;ions were im|puted
<PB N="275" REF="291">
to him, and &s;ome too reflecting on his brother's
legitimacy; but he was not accu&s;ed of any overt act of
trea&s;on; and even the truth of the&s;e &s;peeches may be
doubted, &s;ince the liberty of judgment was taken from
the court, by the King's appearing per&s;onally as his
brother's accu&s;er<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Croyl. cont. p. 562.</NOTE>, and pleading the cau&s;e again&s;t him.
But a &s;entence of condemnation, even when this extra|ordinary
circum&s;tance had not place, was a nece&s;&s;ary
con&s;equence, in tho&s;e times, of any pro&s;ecution by the
court or the prevailing party; and the duke of Clarence
was accordingly pronounced guilty by the peers. The
hou&s;e of commons were no le&s;s &s;lavi&s;h and unju&s;t:
They both petitioned for the execution of the duke,
and afterwards pa&s;&s;ed a bill of attainder again&s;t him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 430. Hi&s;t. Croyl. cont. p. 562.</NOTE>.
The mea&s;ures of the parliament, during that age, furni&s;h
us with examples of a &s;trange contra&s;t of freedom and
&s;ervility: They &s;cruple to grant, and &s;ometimes refu&s;e
to the King the &s;malle&s;t &s;upplies, the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary
for the &s;upport of government, even the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary
for the maintenance of wars, for which the nation, as
well as the parliament it&s;elf, expre&s;&s;ed a great fondne&s;s:
But they never &s;cruple to concur in the mo&s;t flagrant
act of inju&s;tice or tyranny, which falls on any indivi|dual,
however di&s;tingui&s;hed by birth or merit. The&s;e
maxims, &s;o ungenerous, &s;o oppo&s;ite to all the principles
of good government, &s;o contrary to the practice of pre|&s;ent
parliaments, are very remarkable in all the tran&s;|actions
of the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory for more than a century
after the period, in which we are now engaged.</P>

of his death; and he was privately drowned in a butt of
Malme&s;ey in the Tower: A whim&s;ical choice, which
implies that he had an extraordinary pa&s;&s;ion for that
liquor. The duke left two children, by the elde&s;t
daughter of the earl of Warwic, a &s;on created an earl
by his grandfather's title; and a daughter, afterwards
counte&s;s of Sali&s;bury. Both this prince and prince&s;s
were al&s;o unfortunate in their end, and died violent
deaths; a fate which, for many years, attended almo&s;t
all the de&s;cendants of the royal blood in England. There
prevails a report, that a chief &s;ource of the violent pro|&s;ecution
of the duke of Clarence, who&s;e name was
George, was a current prophecy, that the King's &s;ons
&s;hould be murdered by one, the fir&s;t letter of who&s;e
name was G<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Hall, fol. 239. Holing&s;hed, p. 703. Grafton, p. 741. Polyd Virg. p. 537. Sir Thomas More in Kennet, p. 497.</NOTE>. It is not impo&s;&s;ible, that in tho&s;e igno|rant
times, &s;uch a &s;illy rsextremelyea&s;on might have influence:
But it is more probable, that the whole &s;tory is the inven|tion
of a &s;ub&s;equent age, and founded on the murder of
the&s;e children by the duke of Gloce&s;ter. Comines re|marks,
that at that time, the Engli&s;h were never with|out
&s;ome &s;uper&s;titious prophecy or other, by which they
accounted for every event.</P>
<P>ALL the glories of Edward's reign terminated with
the civil wars; where his laurels too were extremely
&s;ullied with blood, violence and cruelty. His &s;pirit
&s;eems afterwards to be &s;unk in indolence and plea&s;ure, or
his mea&s;ures were fru&s;trated by imprudence and the want of
fore&s;ight. There was no object of which he was fonder
than to have all his daughters &s;ettled by &s;plendid marriages,
tho' mo&s;t of the&s;e prince&s;&s;es were yet in their infancy,
and tho' the completion of his views, it was obvious,
mu&s;t depend on numberle&s;s accidents, which were im|po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="277" REF="295">
po&s;&s;ible to be fore&s;een or prevented. His elde&s;t daugh|ter,
Elizabeth, was contracted to the Dauphin; his &s;e|cond,
Cicely, to the elde&s;t &s;on of James III. King of
Scotland; his third, Anne, to Philip, the elde&s;t &s;on of
Maximilian and the dutche&s;s of Burgundy; his fourth,
Catharine, to John, &s;on and heir to Ferdinand, King
of Arragon, and I&s;abella, Queen of Ca&s;tile<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xi. p. 110.</NOTE>. None of
the&s;e projected marriages took place; and the King
him&s;elf &s;aw in his life-time the rupture of the fir&s;t, that
with the Dauphin, for which he had always di&s;covered a
peculiar fondne&s;s. Lewis, who paid no regard to trea|ties
or engagements, found his advantage in contracting
the Dauphin to the prince&s;s Margaret, the daughter of
Maximilian; and the King, notwith&s;tanding his indo|lence,
prepared him&s;elf to revenge this indignity. The
French monarch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1482.</NOTE> eminent for prudence, as well as fal&s;e|hood,
endeavoured to guard again&s;t the blow; and by
a proper di&s;tribution of pre&s;ents in the court of Scot|land,
he excited James to make war upon England.
This weak prince, who lived on bad terms with his own
nobility, and who&s;e force was very unequal to the enter|prize,
levied an army; but when they were preparing
to enter England, the barons, con&s;piring again&s;t his
favourites, put them to death without trial; and the
army presently di&s;per&s;ed. The duke of Gloce&s;ter, at|tended
by the duke of Albany, James's brother, who had
been bani&s;hed his country, entered Scotland at the head
of an army, took Berwic, and obliged the Scots to ac|cept
of a peace, by which they re&s;igned that fortre&s;s to
Edward. This &s;ucce&s;s emboldened the King to think
more &s;eriou&s;ly of a French war; but while he was making
preparations for that enterprize, he was &s;eized with a
di&s;temper, of which he expired in the forty-&s;econd year
<PB N="278" REF="296">
of his age, and the twenty-third of his reign: A prince

<P>DURING the latter years of Edward IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXIII.</NOTE> The
nation, having, in a great mea&s;ure, forgot the
bloody feuds between the two Ro&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1483.</NOTE> and acquie&s;cing
peaceably in the e&s;tabli&s;hed government, was only agi|tated
by &s;ome court-intrigues, which being re&s;trained by
the authority of the King, &s;eemed nowi&s;e to endanger
the public tranquillity, The&s;e intrigues aro&s;e from the
perpetual rival&s;hip between two parties; the one con|&s;i&s;ting
of the queen and her relations, particularly the
earl of Rivers, her brother, and the marquis of Dor&s;et,
her &s;on; the other compo&s;ed of the antient nobility,
who envied the &s;udden growth and unlimited credit of
that a&s;piring family<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Sir Thomas More, p. 481</NOTE>. At the head of this latter party
was the duke of Buckingham, a man of very noble birth,
<PB N="280" REF="298">
of ample po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, of great alliances, of &s;hining parts;
who, tho' he had married the Queen's &s;i&s;ter, was too
haughty to act in &s;ub&s;erviency to her inclinations, and
aimed rather at maintaining an independant influence and
authority. Lord Ha&s;tings, the chamberlain, was another
leader of the &s;ame party; and as this nobleman had, by
his bravery and enterprize, as well as by his approved
fidelity, acquired the confidence and favour of his ma&s;ter,
he had been able, tho' with &s;ome difficulty, to &s;upport
him&s;elf again&s;t the credit of the Queen. The lords
Howard and Stanley maintained a connexion with the&s;e
two noblemen, and brought a con&s;iderable acce&s;&s;ion of
influence and credit to their party. All the other barons,
who had no particular dependance on the Queen, ad|hered
to the &s;ame intere&s;t; and the people in general,
from their natural envy again&s;t the prevailing power,
bore great favour to the cau&s;e of the&s;e noblemen.</P>
<P>BUT Edward knew, that, tho' he him&s;elf had been
able to overawe tho&s;e rival factions, many di&s;orders might
re&s;ult from their conte&s;ts during the minority of his &s;on;
and he therefore took care, in his la&s;t illne&s;s, to &s;ummon
together &s;everal of the leaders on both &s;ides, and, by
compo&s;ing their antient quarrels, to provide, as far as
po&s;&s;ible, for the future tranquillity of the government.
After expre&s;&s;ing his intentions, that his brother, the duke
of Gloce&s;ter, then ab&s;ent in the north, &s;hould be en|tru&s;ted
with the regency, he recommended to them peace
and unanimity during the tender years of his &s;on;
repre&s;ented to them the dangers which mu&s;t attend the
continuance of their animo&s;ities; and engaged them to
embrace each other with all the &s;ymptoms of the mo&s;t
cordial reconciliation. But this temporary or feigned
agreement la&s;ted no longer than the King's life: He had
no &s;ooner expired, than the jealou&s;ies of the parties broke
<PB N="281" REF="299">
out afre&s;h: And each of them applied, by &s;eparate me&s;|&s;ages,
to the duke of Gloce&s;ter, and endeavoured to ac|quire
his favour and friendship.</P>
<P>THIS prince, during his brother's lifetime, had en|deavoured
to live on good terms with both parties; and
his high birth, his exten&s;ive abilities, and his great &s;er|vices,
had enabled him to &s;upport him&s;elf without falling
into a dependance on either. But the new &s;ituation of
affairs, when the &s;upreme power was devolved upon him,
immediately changed all his mea&s;ures; and he &s;ecretly
determined to pre&s;erve no longer that neutrality which he
had hitherto maintained. His exorbitant ambition, unre|&s;trained
by any principle either of ju&s;tice or humanity, made
him carry his views to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown it&s;elf;
and as this object could not be attained without the ruin
of the Queen and her family, he fell, without he&s;itation,
into concert with the oppo&s;ite party. But being &s;en&s;ible,
that the mo&s;t profound di&s;&s;imulation was requi&s;ite to the
effecting his criminal purpo&s;es, he redoubled his profe&s;|&s;ions
of zeal and attachment to that prince&s;s; and he
gained &s;uch credit with her, as to influence her conduct
in a point, which, as it was of the utmo&s;t importance,
was violently di&s;puted between the oppo&s;ite factions.</P>
<P>THE King, at the time of his father's deaths, re&s;ided
in the ca&s;tle of Ludlow, on the borders of Wales; whi|ther
he had been &s;ent, that the influence of his pre&s;ence
might overawe the Wel&s;h, and re&s;tore the tranquillity of
that country, which had been di&s;turbed by &s;ome late
commotions. His per&s;on was committed to the care of
his uncle, the earl of Rivers, the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed
nobleman in England, who, having united an uncom|mon
ta&s;te for literature<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This nobleman fir&s;t introduced the noble art of Printing into England. Caxton was recommended by him to the patronage of Edward IV. See Catalogue of royal and noble authors.</NOTE> to great abilities in bu&s;ine&s;s, and
<PB N="282" REF="300">
valour in the field, was intitled, by his talents, &s;till
more than by nearne&s;s of blood, to direct the education
of the young monarch. The Queen, anxious to pre|&s;erve
that a&s;cendant over her &s;on, which &s;he had &s;o long
maintained over her hu&s;band, wrote to the earl of Rivers,
that he &s;hould levy a body of forces, in order to e&s;cort
the King to London, to protect him during his corona|tion,
and to keep him from falling into the hands of their
enemies. The oppo&s;ite faction, &s;en&s;ible that Edward
was now of an age when great advantages could be made
of his name and countenance, and was approaching to
the age when he would be legally intitled to exert in per|&s;on
his authority, fore&s;aw, that the tendency of this
mea&s;ure was to perpetuate their &s;ubjection under their
rivals; and they vehemently oppo&s;ed a re&s;olution, which
they repre&s;ented as the &s;ignal for renewing a civil war
in the kingdom. Lord Ha&s;tings threatened in&s;tantly to
depart to his government of Calais<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Croyl. cont. p. 564, 565.</NOTE>: The other nobles
&s;eemed re&s;olute to oppo&s;e force by force: And as the
duke of Gloce&s;ter, on pretence of pacifying the quarrel,
had declared again&s;t all appearance of an armed power,
which might be dangerous, and was nowife nece&s;&s;ary,
the Queen, tru&s;ting to the &s;incerity of his friend&s;hip,
and overawed by &s;o violent an oppo&s;ition, revoked her orders
to her brother, and de&s;ired him to bring up no greater
retinue than would be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the &s;tate and
dignity of the young &s;overeign<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Sir T. More, p. 483.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Gloce&s;ter, meanwhile, &s;et out from
York, attended by a numerous train of the northern
gentry. When he reached Northampton, he was joined
by the duke of Buckingham, who was al&s;o attended by
a &s;plendid retinue; and as he heard, that the King was
every hour expected on that road, he re&s;olved to await
<PB N="283" REF="301">
his arrival, under colour of conducting him thence in
per&s;on to London. The earl of Rivers, apprehen&s;ive
that the place would be too narrow to contain &s;o many
attendants, &s;ent his pupil forward by another road to
Stony-Stratford; and came him&s;elf to Northampton, in
order to apologize for this mea&s;ure, and to pay his re&s;pects
to the duke of Gloce&s;ter. He was received with the
greate&s;t appearance of cordiality: He pa&s;&s;ed the evening
in an amicable and friendly manner with Gloce&s;ter and
Buckingham: He proceeded on the road with them next
day to join the King: But as he was entering Stony-Stratford,
he was arre&s;ted by orders of the duke of Glo|ce&s;ter<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Croyl. cont. p. 564, 565.</NOTE>:
Sir Richard Gray,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The earl of Rivers ar|re&s;ted. 1&s;t of May.</NOTE> one of the Queen's &s;ons,
was at the &s;ame time put under a guard, together with
Sir Thomas Vaughan, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable office
in the King's hou&s;hold; and all the pri&s;oners were in|&s;tantly
conducted to Pomfret. Gloce&s;ter approached the
young prince with the greate&s;t demon&s;trations of re&s;pect;
and endeavoured to &s;atisfy him with regard to the violence
committed on his uncle and brother: But Edward, much
attached to the&s;e near relations, by whom he had been
tenderly educated, was not &s;uch a ma&s;ter of di&s;&s;imula|tion
as to conceal his di&s;plea&s;ure<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Sir T. More, p. 484.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE people, however, were extremely rejoiced at this
revolution;<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th May.</NOTE> and the duke was received in London with
the loude&s;t acclamations: But the Queen no &s;ooner re|ceived
intelligence of her brother's impri&s;onment, than
&s;he fore&s;aw, that Gloce&s;ter's violence would not &s;top
there, and that her own ruin, if not that of all her child|ren,
was finally determined. She therefore fled into
the &s;anctuary of We&s;tmin&s;ter, attended by the marquis
of Dor&s;et; and &s;he carried thither the five prince&s;&s;es to|gether
<PB N="284" REF="302">
with the duke of York<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Croyl. cont, p. 565.</NOTE>. She tru&s;ted, that the
eccle&s;ia&s;tical privileges, which had formerly, during the
total ruin of her hu&s;band and family, given her protection
again&s;t the fury of the Lanca&s;trian faction, would not
now be violated by her brother-in-law, while her &s;on
was &s;eated on the throne; and &s;he re&s;olved to await
there the return of better fortune. But Gloce&s;ter, an|xious
to have the duke of York in his power, propo&s;ed
to take him by force from the &s;anctuary; and he repre|sented
to the privy council, both the indignity put upon
the government by the Queen's ill-grounded apprehen|&s;ions,
and the nece&s;&s;ity of the young prince's appearance
at the en&s;uing coronation of his brother. It was farther
alledged, that eccle&s;ia&s;tical privileges were originally cal|culated
only to give protection to unhappy men, per&s;e|cuted
for their debts or crimes; and were entirely u&s;ele&s;s
to a per&s;on, who, by rea&s;on of his tender age, could lie
under the burden of neither, and who, for the &s;ame
rea&s;on, was utterly incapable of claiming &s;ecurity from
any &s;anctuary. But the two archbi&s;hops, cardinal Bour|chier,
the primate, and Rotheram archbi&s;hop of York,
prote&s;ting again&s;t the &s;acrilege of this mea&s;ure; it was
agreed, that they &s;hould fir&s;t endeavour to bring the
Queen to compliance by per&s;ua&s;ion, before any violence
&s;hould be employed again&s;t her. The&s;e prelates were
known to be per&s;ons of integrity and honour; and being
them&s;elves entirely per&s;uaded of the &s;incerity of the
duke's intentions, they employed every argument, ac|companied
with zealous entreaties, exhortations, and
a&s;&s;urances, to bring her over to the &s;ame opinion. She
continued long ob&s;tinate, and in&s;i&s;ted, that the duke of
York, by living in the &s;anctuary, was not only &s;ecure
him&s;elf, but gave al&s;o &s;ecurity to the King, who&s;e life
<PB N="285" REF="303">
no one would dare to attempt, while his &s;ucce&s;&s;or and
avenger remained in &s;afety. But finding, that no one
&s;upported her in her &s;entiments, and that force, in ca&s;e
of refu&s;al, was threatened by the council, &s;he at la&s;t
complied, and produced her &s;on to the two prelates.
She was here on a &s;udden &s;truck with a kind of pre&s;age
of his future fate: She tenderly embraced him; &s;he be|dewed
him with her tears; and bidding him an eternal
adieu, delivered him, with many expre&s;&s;ions of regret
and reluctance, into their cu&s;tody<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Sir T. More, p. 491.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE duke of Gloce&s;ter, being the neare&s;t male of
the royal family capable of exerci&s;ing the government,
&s;eemed fully intitled, by the cu&s;toms of the realm, to the
office of protector;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke of Gloce&s;ter protector.</NOTE> and the council, not waiting for
Duke of the con&s;ent of parliament, in&s;talled him, without &s;cruple,
in that high dignity<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t, Croyl. cont. p. 566.</NOTE>. The general prejudice entertain|ed
by the nobility again&s;t the Queen and her kindred,
occa&s;ioned this precipitation and irregularity; and no one
fore&s;aw any danger to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, much le&s;s to the
life of the infant princes, from a mea&s;ure &s;o obvious and
&s;o natural. Be&s;ides that the duke had hitherto been able
to cover, by the mo&s;t profound di&s;&s;imulation, his fierce
and &s;avage nature; the numerous i&s;&s;ue of Edward, to|gether
with the two children of Clarence, &s;eemed to be
an eternal ob&s;tacle to his ambition; and it appeared
equally impracticable for him to di&s;patch &s;o many per&s;ons
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a preferable title, and imprudent to exclude
them. But a man, who had abandoned all principles
of honour and humanity, was &s;oon carried by his pre|dominant
pa&s;&s;ion beyond the reach of fear or precaution;
and Gloce&s;ter, having &s;o far &s;ucceeded in his views, no
longer he&s;itated in removing the farther ob&s;tructions
which lay between him and the crown. The death of
<PB N="286" REF="304">
the earl of Rivers, and of the other pri&s;oners detained
in Pomfret was fir&s;t determined; and he ea&s;ily ob|tained
the con&s;ent of the duke of Buckingham, as well
as of lord Ha&s;tings, to this violent and &s;anguinary
mea&s;ure. However ea&s;y it was, in tho&s;e illegal and
barbarous times, to procure a &s;entence again&s;t the mo&s;t
innocent per&s;on, it appeared &s;till more ea&s;y to di&s;patch
an enemy, without any trial or form, of proce&s;s; and
orders were accordingly i&s;&s;ued to Sir Richard Ratcliffe, a
proper in&s;trument in the hands of this tyrant, to cut
off the heads of the noble pri&s;oners. The protector then
a&s;&s;ailed the fidelity of Buckingham by all the arguments
capable of &s;waying a vicious mind, which knew no mo|tive
of action but intere&s;t and ambition. He repre&s;ented,
that the murder of per&s;ons &s;o nearly related to the King,
whom that prince profe&s;&s;ed &s;o openly to love, and who&s;e
injuries he &s;o much re&s;ented, would never pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed;
and all the actors in that &s;cene were bound in prudence to
prevent the effects of his future vengeance; That it
would be impo&s;&s;ible to keep the Queen forever at a
di&s;tance from her &s;on, and equally impo&s;&s;ible to prevent
her from in&s;tilling into his tender mind the thoughts of
retaliating, by like executions, the &s;anguinary in&s;ults
committed on her family: That the only method of ob|viating
the&s;e mi&s;chiefs was by putting the &s;ceptre into
the hands of a man, of who&s;e friendship the duke might
be a&s;&s;ured, and who&s;e years and experience taught him
to pay re&s;ect to merit and to the rights of antient no|bility:
And that the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity which had carried
them &s;o far in re&s;i&s;ting the u&s;urpation of the&s;e intruders,
mu&s;t ju&s;tify them in attempting farther innovations, and
in makings by national con&s;ent, a new &s;ettlement of the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion. To the&s;e rea&s;ons, he added the offers of great
private advantages to the duke of Buckingham, and he
<PB N="287" REF="305">
ea&s;ily obtained from him a promi&s;e of &s;upporting him in
all his enterprizes.</P>
<P>THE duke of Gloce&s;ter, knowing the importance of
gaining lord Ha&s;tings, &s;ounded at a di&s;tance his &s;enti|ments,
by the means of one Cate&s;by, a lawyer, who was
a great confident of that nobleman; but found him im|pregnable
in his allegiance and fidelity to the children of
Edward, who had ever honoured him with his friend|&s;hip<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Sir T. More, p. 493.</NOTE>.
He &s;aw, therefore, that there was no longer any
mea&s;ures to be kept with him; and he determined to ruin
utterly the man, whom he de&s;paired of engaging to
concur in his u&s;urpation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th June.</NOTE> On the very day when Rivers,
Gray, and Vaughan, were executed, or rather murdered,
at Pomfret, by Ha&s;tings's advice, the protector &s;ummoned
a council in the Tower; whither that nobleman, &s;u&s;pect|ing
no de&s;ign again&s;t him, repaired without he&s;itation.
The duke of Gloce&s;ter was capable of committing the
mo&s;t bloody and treacherous murders with the utmo&s;t
coolne&s;s and indifference. On taking his place at the
council-board, he appeared in the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t jovial
humour in the world. He &s;eemed to indulge him&s;elf in
familiar conver&s;ation with the coun&s;ellors, before they
&s;hould enter upon bu&s;ine&s;s; and having paid &s;ome com|pliments
to Morton, bi&s;hop of Ely, on the good and
early &s;trawberries which he railed in his garden at Hol|born,
he begged the favour of having a di&s;h of them,
which that prelate immediately di&s;patched a &s;ervant to
bring him. The protector then left the council, as if
called away by &s;ome other bu&s;ine&s;s; but &s;oon after re|turning
with an angry and enflamed countenance, he a&s;ked
them, what puni&s;hment tho&s;e de&s;erved that had plotted
again&s;t <HI>his</HI> life, who was &s;o nearly related to the King,
and was entru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of the govern|ment?
<PB N="288" REF="306">
Ha&s;tings replied, that they merited the puni&s;h|ment
of traitors. <HI>The&s;e traitors,</HI> cried the protector,
<HI>are the &s;orcere&s;s, my brother's wife, and Jane Shore, his
mi&s;tre&s;s, with others their a&s;&s;ociates: See to what a condi|tion
they have reduced me by their incantations and witch|craft:</HI>
Upon, which he laid bare his arm, all &s;hrivelled
and decayed. But the coun&s;ellors, who knew that this
infirmity had attended him from his birth, looked at each
other in amazement; and above all, lord Ha&s;tings, who
as he had, &s;ince Edward's death, engaged in an intrigue
with Jane Shore<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Sir Thomas More, who has been followed, or rather tran&s;cribed, by all the hi&s;torians of this &s;hort reign, &s;ays, that Jane Shore had fallen into connexions with lord Ha&s;tings; and this account agrees be&s;t with the cour&s;e of the events: But in a proclamation of Richard's, to be found in Rymer, vol. xii. p. 204, the marquis of Dor&s;et is reproached with the&s;e connexions. This reproach, however, might have been invented by Richard, or founded only on popular rumour; and is not &s;uf|ficient to overbalance the authority of Sir Thomas More. The procla|mation is remarkable for the hypocritical purity of manners affected by Richard: This bloody and treacherous tyrant upbraids the marquis and others, with their gallantries and intrigues as the molt terrible enor|mities.</NOTE>, was naturally anxious concerning
the i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e extraordinary proceedings. <HI>Certainly
my lord,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>if they be guilty of the&s;e crimes, they de|&s;erve
the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment. And do you reply to me,</HI> ex|claimed
the Protector, <HI>with your</HI> ifs <HI>and your</HI> ands? <HI>You
are the chief abettor of that witch Shore: You are your&s;elf
a traitor: And I &s;wear by St. Paul, that I will not dine be|fore

his hand: Armed men ru&s;hed in at the &s;ignal: The
coun&s;ellors were thrown into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation:
And one of the guards, as if by accident or mi&s;take,
aimed a blow at lord Stanley, with a poll-ax, who, aware
of the danger, &s;lunk below the table, and tho' he &s;aved
his life, he received a &s;evere wound on the head, in the
<PB N="289" REF="307">
protector's pre&s;ence. Ha&s;tings was &s;eized, was hurried
away, and in&s;tantly beheaded on a timber-log, which
lay in the court of the Tower<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Croyl. cont. p. 566.</NOTE>. Two hours after, a
proclamation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of lord Ha&s;tings.</NOTE> well penned and fairly wrote, was read
to the citizens or London, enumerating Ha&s;tings's of|fences,
and apologizing to them, from the &s;uddenne&s;s
of the di&s;covery, for the &s;udden execution of that noble|man,
who was very popular among them: But the &s;ay|ing
of a merchant was much talked of on that occa&s;ion,
who remarked, that the proclamation was certainly
drawn by the &s;pirit of prophecy<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Sir T. More, p. 496.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LORD Stanley, the archbi&s;hop of York, the bi&s;hop of
Ely, and other coun&s;ellors, were committed pri&s;oners in
different chambers of the Tower: And the protector,
in order to carry on the farce of his accu&s;ations, ordered
the goods of Jane Shore to be &s;eized; and he &s;ummoned
her to an&s;wer before the council for forcery and inchant|ment.
But as no proofs, which could be received even
in that ignorant age, were produced again&s;t her, he or|dered
her to be tried in the &s;piritual court, for her adul|teries
and lewdne&s;s and &s;he did penance in a white
&s;heet at St. Paul's before the whole people. This lady
was born of reputable parents in London, was well edu|cated,
and married to a &s;ub&s;tantial citizen; but unhap|pily,
views of intere&s;t, more than the maid's inclina|tions,
had been con&s;ulted in this match, and her mind,
tho' framed for virtue, had proved unable to re&s;i&s;t the
allurements of Edward, who &s;olicited her favours. But
while &s;educed from her duty by this gay and amorous
monarch, &s;he &s;till made her&s;elf re&s;pectable by her other
virtues; and the a&s;cendant, which her charms and viva|city
long maintained over him, was all employed in, acts
<PB N="290" REF="308">
of beneficence and humanity. She was &s;till forward to
oppo&s;e calumny, to protect the oppre&s;&s;ed, to relieve the
indigent; and her good offices, the genuine re&s;ult of her
heart, never waited the &s;olicitation of pre&s;ents, or the
hopes of reciprocal favours. But &s;he lived not only to
feel the bitterne&s;s of &s;hame impo&s;ed on her by this bar|barous
tyrant, but to experience in old age and poverty,
the ingratitude of tho&s;e courtiers, who had long &s;olicited
her friend&s;hip, and been protected by her credit. No
one, among the great multitudes, whom &s;he had oblig|ed,
appeared to bring her con&s;olation or relief: She
langui&s;hed out her life in &s;olitude and indigence: And
amid&s;t a court, enured to the mo&s;t atrocious crimes, the
frailties of this woman ju&s;tified all violations of friend|&s;hip
towards her, and all oblivion of former favours.</P>
<P>THOSE acts of violence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The protector aims at the crown.</NOTE> exerci&s;ed again&s;t all the near|e&s;t
connexions of the late King, progno&s;ticated the &s;e|vere&s;t
fate to his defencele&s;s children; and after the mur|der
of Ha&s;tings, the protector made no longer a &s;ecret
of his intentions to u&s;urp the crown. The licentious life
of Edward, who was not re&s;trained in his plea&s;ures by
any principle either of honour or prudence, afforded a
pretence for declaring his marriage with the Queen in|valid,
and all his po&s;terity illegitimate. It was a&s;&s;erted,
that before his e&s;pou&s;als with the lady Elizabeth Gray,
he had paid court to the lady Eleanor Talbot, daughter
of the earl of Shrew&s;bury; and being repul&s;ed by the
virtue of that lady, he was obliged, ere he could gratify
his de&s;ires, to con&s;ent to a private marriage, without any
witne&s;&s;es, by Stillington, bi&s;hop of Bath, who after|wards
revealed the &s;ecret<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Croyl. cont. p. 567. Comines. Sir Thomas More, p. 482.</NOTE>: It was al&s;o maintained, that
the act of attainder, pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the duke of Clarence,
<PB N="291" REF="309">
had virtually incapacitated his children from &s;ucceed|ing
to the crown; and the&s;e two families being &s;et a&s;ide,
the protector of cour&s;e remained the only true and le|gitimate
heir of the hou&s;e of York. But as it would be
difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to prove the preceding mar|riage
of the late King; and as the principle which ex|cluded
the heirs of an attainted blood, from private &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ions
was never extended to the crown $word$ the protector
re&s;olved to make u&s;e of another plea &s;till more &s;hameful
and &s;candalous. His partizans were taught to maintain,
that both Edward IV. and the duke of Clarence, were
illegitimate; that the dutche&s;s of York had received
different lovers into her bed, who were the fathers of
the&s;e children; that their re&s;emblance to tho&s;e gallants
was a &s;ufficient proof of their &s;purious, birth; and that
the duke of Gloce&s;ter alone, of all her &s;ons, appeared,
by his features and countenance, to be the lawful offspring
of the duke of York. Nothing can be imagined more
impudent than this a&s;&s;ertion, which threw &s;o foul an
imputation on his own mother, a prince&s;s of irreproach|able
virtue, and then alive; yet the place cho&s;en for fir&s;t
promulgating it was the pulpit, before the whole people,
and in the protector's pre&s;ence. Dr. Shaw was appointed
to preach in St. Paul's;<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d June.</NOTE> and having cho&s;en this pa&s;&s;age
for his text, <HI>Ba&s;tard &s;lips &s;hall not thrive,</HI> he enlarged on
all the topics, which could di&s;credit the birth of Edward
IV. the duke of Clarence, and of all their children. He
then broke out in a panegyric on the duke of Gloce&s;ter;
and exclaimed, &startq;Behold this excellent prince, the ex|pre&s;s
image of his noble father, the genuine de&s;cend|ant
of the hou&s;e of York, bearing, no le&s;s in the vir|tues
of his mind, than in the features of his coun|tenance,
the character of the gallant Richard, once
your hero and favourite: He alone is entitled to your
allegiance: He mu&s;t deliver you from the dominion of
<PB N="292" REF="310" MS="Y">
all intruders: He alone can re&s;tore the lo&s;t glory and
honour of the nation.&endq; It was previously contrived,
that, as the doctor &s;hould pronounce the&s;e words, the
duke of Gloce&s;ter &s;hould enter the church; and it was
expected that the audience &s;hould cry out, <HI>God &s;ave
King Richard;</HI> which would immediately have been laid
hold of as a popular con&s;ent, and interpreted to be the
voice of the nation: But by a ridiculous mi&s;take, worthy
of the whole &s;cene, the duke did not appear, till after
this exclamation was already recited by the preacher.
The doctor was therefore obliged to repeat his rhetorical
figure out of its proper place: The audience, le&s;s from
the ab&s;urd conduct of the di&s;cour&s;e, than from their de|te&s;tation
of the&s;e proceedings, kept a profound &s;ilence;
and the protector and his preacher, were equally aba&s;hed
at the ill &s;ucce&s;s of their &s;tratagem.</P>
<P>BUT the duke was too far advanced to recede from his
criminal and ambitious projects. A new expedient was
tried to work on the people. The mayor, who was
brother to Dr. Shaw, and entirely in the protector's in|tere&s;ts,
called an a&s;&s;embly of the citizens; where the
duke of Buckingham, a man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome talents
for eloquence, harangued them on the protector's title
to the throne, and di&s;played tho&s;e numerous virtues, of
which, he pretended, that prince was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. He
next a&s;ked them, whether they would not have the
duke for King? and then &s;topt, in expectation of hear|ing
the cry, <HI>God &s;ave King Richard.</HI> He was &s;urprized
to ob&s;erve them &s;ilent; and turning about to the mayor,
he a&s;ked him the rea&s;on. The mayor replied, that per|haps
they did under&s;tand him. Buckingham then re|peated
his di&s;cour&s;e with &s;ome variation; inforced th
ame topics, a&s;ked the &s;ame que&s;tion, and was received
with the &s;ame &s;ilence. &startq;I now &s;ee the cau&s;e,&endq; &s;aid
<PB N="293" REF="311">
the mayor, &startq;the citizens are not accu&s;tomed to be ha|rangued
by any but their recorder; and know not
how to an&s;wer a per&s;on of your grace's quality.&endq; The
recorder, Fitz-Williams, was then commanded to repeat
the &s;ub&s;tance of the duke's &s;peech; but the man, who
was very aver&s;e to the office, took care, throughout his
whole di&s;cour&s;e, to have it understood, that he &s;poke
nothing of him&s;elf, and that he only conveyed to them
the &s;en&s;e of the duke of Buckingham. Still the audience
kept a profound &s;ilence: &startq;This is wonderful ob&s;tinacy,&endq;
cried the duke: &startq;Expre&s;s your meaning, my friends,
one way or other: When we apply to you on this occa|&s;ion,
it is merely from the regard which we bear to
you. The lords and commons have &s;ufficient autho|rity,
without your con&s;ent, to appoint a King: But I
require you here to declare in plain terms, whether or
not you will have the duke of Gloce&s;ter for your &s;o|vereign.&endq;
After all the&s;e efforts, &s;ome of the meane&s;t
apprentices, incited by the protector's and Buckingham's
&s;ervants, rai&s;ed a feeble cry, <HI>God &s;ave King Richard</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Sir Thomas More, p. 496.</NOTE>:
The &s;entiments of the nation, were now &s;ufficiently de|clared;
The voice of the people was the voice of God:
And Buckingham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th June.</NOTE> with the mayor ha&s;tened to Bay|nard's
ca&s;tle, where the protector then re&s;ided, that they
might engage him to a&s;&s;ume the government.</P>
<P>WHEN Richard was told, that a great multitude was
in the court, he refu&s;ed to appear to them, and pretended
to be apprehen&s;ive for his per&s;ona$l &s;afety: A circum&s;tance
much taken notice of by Buckingham, who ob&s;erved to
the citizens, that the prince was ignorant of the whole
de&s;ign. At la&s;t, he was per&s;uaded to come forth, but he
&s;till kept at &s;ome di&s;tance; and he a&s;ked the meaning of
their intru&s;ion and importunity. Buckingham told him,
<PB N="294" REF="312">
that the nation were re&s;olved to have him for King:
The protector declared his purpo&s;e to maintain his loyalty
to the present &s;overeign, and exhorted them to adhere to
the &s;ame re&s;olution. He was told, that the nation were
determined to have another prince; and if he rejected
their unanimous voice, they mu&s;t look out for one, who
would be more compliant.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pro|tector a&s;|&s;umes the throne.</NOTE> This argument was too
powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted: He was prevailed on to accept of

<P>THIS ridiculous farce was &s;oon after followed by a

princes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Murder of Edward V. and of the duke of York.</NOTE> Richard &s;ent orders to Sir Robert Brakenbury,

and he ordered Brakenbury to re&s;ign to this gentle|man
the keys of the Tower for one night, Tyrrel,
choo&s;ing three a&s;&s;ociates, Slater, Dighton and Fore&s;t,
came in the night-time to the door of the chamber
where the princes were lodged; and &s;ending in the a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;ins,
he bid them execute their commi&s;&s;ion; while he
him&s;elf &s;aid without. They found the young princes
in bed, and fallen into a &s;ound &s;leep. After &s;uffocating
them with the bol&s;ter and pillows, they &s;howed their
naked bodies to Tyrrel, who ordered them to be buried
at the &s;tair foot, deep in the ground, under a heap of
&s;tones<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Sir T. More, p. 501.</NOTE>. The&s;e circum&s;tances were all confe&s;&s;ed by the
actors in the following reign; and they were never pu|ni&s;hed
for the crime: Probably, becau&s;e Henry, who&s;e
maxims of government were extremely arbitrary, de&s;ired
e&s;tabli&s;h it as a principle, that the commands of the
<PB N="295" REF="313">
reigning &s;overeign ought to ju&s;tify every enormity in
tho&s;e who paid obedience to them. But there is one cir|cum&s;tance
not &s;o ea&s;y to be accounted for: It is pre|tended,
that Richard, di&s;plea&s;ed with this indecent man|ner
of burying his nephews, whom he had murdered,
gave his chaplain orders to dig up the bodies, and to in|ter
them in con&s;ecrated ground; and as the man died &s;oon
after, the place of their burial remained unknown, and
the bodies could never be found by any &s;earch, which
Henry VII. could make for them. Yet in the reign of
Charles II. when there was occa&s;ion to remove &s;ome
&s;tones and to dig into the very &s;pot, which was mention|ed
as the place of their fir&s;t interment, the bones of two
per&s;ons were there found, which by their &s;ize corre|&s;ponded
exactly to the age of Edward and his brother:
They were concluded with certainty to be the remains of
tho&s;e princes, and were interred under a marble monu|ment
by orders of King Charles<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 551.</NOTE>. Perhaps, Richard's
chaplain had died before he found an opportunity of execut|ing
his ma&s;ter's commands; and the bodies being &s;uppo&s;ed
to be already removed, a diligent &s;earch was not made
for them by Henry in the place where they had been
interred.</P>

<HEAD>RICHARD III.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t acts of Richard's admini&s;tration were to
be&s;tow rewards on tho&s;e who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in
u&s;urping the crown, and to gain by favours tho&s;e, who,
he thought, were be&s;t able to &s;upport his future go|vernment.
Thomas, lord Howard, was created duke
of Norfolk; Sir Thomas Howard, his &s;on, earl of Sur|rey;
lord Lovel, a vi&s;count by the &s;ame name; even
lord Stanley was &s;et at liberty and made lord &s;teward of
the hou&s;hold. This nobleman had become obnoxious
by his fir&s;t oppo&s;ition to Richard's views, and al&s;o by
his marrying the counte&s;s dowager of Richmond, the
heire&s;s of the Somer&s;et family; but &s;en&s;ible of the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the pre&s;ent government, he coun|terfeited
&s;uch zeal for Richard's cau&s;e, that he was re|ceived
into favour, and even found means to be entru&s;ted
with the mo&s;t important commands by that politic and
jealous tyrant.</P>
<P>BUT the per&s;on, who, both from the greatne&s;s of his
&s;ervices, and the power and &s;plendor of his family, was
be&s;t intitled to favours under the new government, was
the duke of Buckingham; and Richard &s;eemed deter|mined
to &s;pare no pains nor bounty in &s;ecuring him to
his intere&s;ts. Buckingham was de&s;cended from a daugh|ter
of Thomas of Wood&s;tock, duke of Gloce&s;ter, uncle
to Richard II. and by this pedigree, he was both allied
to the royal family, and had claims for dignities as well
as e&s;tates, of a very exten&s;ive nature. The duke of
Gloce&s;ter, and Henry earl of Derby, afterwards Henry
IV. had married the two daughters and co-heirs of Bo|hun,
earl of Hereford, one of the greate&s;t of the an|tient
barons, who&s;e immen&s;e property came thus to be
<PB N="297" REF="315">
divided into two &s;hares. The one was inherited by the
family of Buckingham; the other was united to the
crown by the family of Lanca&s;ter, and after the forfeit|ure
of that royal line, was &s;eized as legally devolved to
them, by the &s;overeigns of the hou&s;e of York. The
duke of Buckingham laid hold of the pre&s;ent opportu|nity,
and claimed the re&s;titution of that portion of the
Hereford e&s;tate, which had e&s;cheated to the crown, as
well as of the great office of con&s;table, which had long
continued by inheritance in his ance&s;tors of that family.
Richard readily complied with the&s;e demands, which
were probably the price &s;tipulated to Buckingham for
his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in promoting the u&s;urpation. That noble|man
was in&s;talled in the office of con&s;table; he received
a grant of the e&s;tate of Hereford<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Dugdale's Baron. vol. i. p. 168, 169.</NOTE>; many other digni|ties
and honours were conferred upon him; and the King
thought him&s;elf &s;ecure of pre&s;erving the fidelity of a man,
who&s;e intere&s;ts &s;eemed to be &s;o clo&s;ely connected with
tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent government.</P>
<P>BUT it was impo&s;&s;ible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke of Buckingham di&s;|contented.</NOTE> that friend&s;hip could long re|main
inviolate between two men of &s;uch corrupt mo|rals
as Richard and the duke of Buckingham. Hi&s;tori|ans
a&s;cribe their fir&s;t quarrel to the King's refu&s;al of
making re&s;titution of the Hereford e&s;tate; but it is cer|tain
from records, that he pa&s;&s;ed a grant for that pur|po&s;e,
and that the full demands of Buckingham were &s;a|tisfied
in this particular. Perhaps, Richard was &s;oon
&s;en&s;ible of the danger which might en&s;ue from conferring
&s;uch an immen&s;e property on a man of &s;o turbulent a cha|racter,
and afterwards rai&s;ed difficulties about the execu|tion
of his own grant: Perhaps he refu&s;ed &s;ome other
demands of Buckingham, whom he found it impo&s;&s;ible
to &s;atisfy for his pa&s;t, &s;ervices: Perhaps, he re&s;olved, ac|cording
<PB N="298" REF="316">
to the u&s;ual maxim of politicians, to &s;eize the
fir&s;t opportunity of ruining this powerful &s;ubject, who
had been the principal in&s;trument of his own elevation;
and the di&s;covery of this intention begot the fir&s;t &s;u&s;pi|cions
in the duke of Buckingham. However this may
be, it is certain, that the duke, &s;oon after Richard's acce&s;|&s;ion,
began to form a con&s;piracy again&s;t the government,
and attempted to overthrow that u&s;urpation, which he
him&s;elf had &s;o zealou&s;ly contributed to e&s;tabli&s;h.</P>
<P>NEVER was there an u&s;urpation in any country more
flagrant than that of Richard, nor more repugnant to every principle of ju&s;tice and public intere&s;t. His claim was entirely founded on impudent allegations, never at|tempted
to be proved, &s;ome of them incapable of proof,
and all of them, implying &s;candalous reflections on his
own family, and on the per&s;ons with whom he was the
mo&s;t nearly connected. His title was never acknowledged
by any national a&s;&s;embly, &s;carce even by the lowe&s;t po|pulace
to whom he appealed; and had become prevalent
merely for want of &s;ome per&s;on of di&s;tinction, who might
&s;tand forth again&s;t him, and give a voice to tho&s;e &s;enti|ments

public right, the &s;en&s;e of private and dome&s;tic duty,
which is not to be effaced in the mo&s;t barbarous times,
mu&s;t have begot an abhorrence again&s;t him; and have
repre&s;ented the murder of the young and innocent prin|ces,
his nephews, with who&s;e protection he had been
entru&s;ted, in the mo&s;t odious colours imaginable. To
endure &s;uch a bloody u&s;urper &s;eemed to draw di&s;grace
upon the nation, and to be attended with immediate dan|ger
to every individual, who was di&s;tingui&s;hed by his
birth, merit, or &s;ervices. Such was become the general
voice of the people; all parties were united in the &s;ame
<PB N="299" REF="317">
&s;entiments; and the Lanca&s;trians, &s;o long oppre&s;&s;ed, and,
of late, &s;o much di&s;credited, felt their bla&s;ted hopes
again revive, and anxiou&s;ly attended to the con&s;equences
of the&s;e extraordinary events. The duke of Bucking|ham,
who&s;e family had been devoted to that intere&s;t,
and who, by his mother, a daughter of Edmund, duke
of Somer&s;et, was allied to the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, was
ea&s;ily inclined to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of this party, and to
endeavour the re&s;toring if to its antient &s;uperiority. Mor|ton,
bi&s;hop of Ely, a zealous Lanca&s;trian, whom the
King had impri&s;oned, and had afterwards committed to
the cu&s;tody of Buckingham, encouraged the&s;e &s;entiments;
and by his exhortations the duke ca&s;t his eye on the
young earl of Richmond, as the only per&s;on, who could
free the nation from the tyranny of the pre&s;ent u&s;urper<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Croyl. cont. p. 568.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY, earl of Richmond,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The earl of Richmond.</NOTE> was at this time detained
in a kind of honourable cu&s;tody by the duke of Brittany;
and his de&s;cent, which &s;eemed to give him &s;ome preten|&s;ions
to the crown, had been a great object of jealou&s;y
both in the late and in the pre&s;ent reign. John, the
fir&s;t duke of Somer&s;et, who was grand&s;on of John of
Gaunt, by a &s;purious branch, but legitimated by act of
parliament, had left only one daughter, Margaret; and
his younger brother, Edmund, had &s;ucceeded him in his
titles, and in a con&s;iderable part of his fortune. Mar|garet
had e&s;pou&s;ed Edmund, earl of Richmond, half bro|ther
of Henry VI. and &s;on of Sir Owen Tudor and Ca|therine
of France, relict of Henry V. and &s;he bore him
only one &s;on, who received the name of Henry, and who,
after his father's death, inherited the honours and fortune
of Richmond. His mother, being a widow, had e&s;pou&s;|ed
in &s;econd marriage Sir Henry Stafford, uncle to Buck|ingham,
and after the death of that gentleman, had mar|ried
<PB N="300" REF="318">
the pre&s;ent lord Stanley; but had no children by ei|ther
of the&s;e hu&s;bands; and her &s;on, Henry, was thus, in
the event of her death, the only lawful heir of all her
fortunes. But this was not the mo&s;t con&s;iderable ad|vantage,
which he had rea&s;on to expect from her &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion:
He would repre&s;ent the elde&s;t branch of the
hou&s;e of Somer&s;et; he would inherit all the title of that
family to the crown; and tho' its claim, while any le|gitimate
branch &s;ub&s;i&s;ted of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, had
always been much di&s;regarded, the zeal of faction, after
$word$ death of Henry VI. and the murder of prince Ed|ward,
immediately conferred a weight and con&s;ideration
upon it.</P>
<P>KING Edward IV. finding, that all the Lanca&s;trains
had ca&s;t their eyes towards the young earl of Rich|mond,
as the object of their hopes, thought him al&s;o
worthy of his attention; and pur&s;ued him into his re|treat
in Brittany, whither his uncle, the earl of Pem|broke,
had carried him, after the battle of Teuke&s;bury,
&s;o fatal to his party. He applied to Francis II. duke of
Brittany, who was his ally, a weak but a good prince;
and de&s;ired him to deliver up this fugitive, who might be
the &s;ource of future di&s;turbances in England: But the
duke, aver&s;e to &s;o di&s;honourable a propo&s;al, would only
con&s;ent, that, for the &s;ecurity of Edward, the young
nobleman &s;hould be detained in cu&s;tody; and he received
an annual pen&s;ion from England for the &s;afe keeping or
&s;ub&s;i&s;tance of his pri&s;oner. But towards the end of Ed|ward's
reign, when the kingdom was menaced with a
war both from France and Scotland, the anxieties of the
Engli&s;h court with regard to Henry were very much en|crea&s;ed;
and Edward made a new propo&s;al to the duke,
which covered, under the faire&s;t appearances, the mo&s;t
bloody and treacherous intentions. He pretended, that
<PB N="301" REF="319">
he was de&s;irous of gaining his enemy, and of uniting
him to his own family by a marriage with his daughter,
Elizabeth; and he &s;olicited to have him &s;ent over to
England, for the executing a &s;cheme, which would re|dound
&s;o much to his advantage. The&s;e pretences, &s;e|conded
by bri$es to Peter Landais, a corrupt mini&s;ter,
by whom the duke was entirely governed, gained credit
with the court of Brittany: Henry was delivered into the
hands of the Engli&s;h agents: He was ready to embark:
When a &s;u&s;picion of Edward's real de&s;ign was &s;ugge&s;ted
to the duke, who recalled his orders, and thus &s;aved the
unhappy youth from the imminent danger, which hung
over him.</P>
<P>THESE &s;ymptoms of continued jealou&s;y in the reign|ing
family of England both &s;eemed to give &s;ome autho|rity
to Henry's preten&s;ions, and made him the object of
general favour and compa&s;&s;ion, on account of the dan|gers
and per&s;ecutions to which he was expo&s;ed. The
univer&s;al dete&s;tation of Richard's conduct turned &s;till
more the attention of the nation towards him; and as all
the de&s;cendants of the hou&s;e of York were either women
or minors, he &s;eemed to be the only per&s;on from whom
the nation could expect the expul&s;ion of the odious and
bloody tyrant. But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e circum&s;tanes,
which were &s;o favourable to Henry, Buckingham and
the bi&s;hop of Ely well knew, that there would &s;till lie
many ob&s;tacles in his way to the throne; and that tho'
the nation had been extremely divided between Henry
VI. and the duke of York, when pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and
hereditary right &s;tood in oppo&s;ition to each other; yet, &s;o
&s;oon as the&s;e titles were conjoined by Edward IV. The
bulk of the people had come over to the reigning family;
and the Lanca&s;trians had extremely decayed both in
numbers and authority. It was therefore &s;ugge&s;ted by
<PB N="302" REF="320">
Morton, and readily a&s;&s;ented to by the duke, that the
only means of overturning the pre&s;ent u&s;urpation, was
to unite the oppo&s;ite factions, by contracting a marriage
between the earl of Richmond and the prince&s;s Elizabeth,
elde&s;t daughter of King Edward, and thereby blending
together the oppo&s;ite preten&s;ions of their families, which
had &s;o long been the &s;ource of public di&s;orders and
convul&s;ions. They were &s;en&s;ible, that the people were
extremely de&s;irous of repo&s;e after &s;o many bloody and
de&s;tructive commotions; that both Yorki&s;ts and Lan|ca&s;trians,
who now lay equally under oppre&s;&s;ion, would
embrace this &s;cheme with ardour; and that the pro&s;pect
of reconciling the two parties, which was in it&s;elf &s;o de|&s;irable
an end, would, when added to the general hatred
of the pre&s;ent government, render their cau&s;e ab&s;olutely
invincible. In con&s;equence of the&s;e views, the prelate,
by means of Reginald Bray, &s;teward to the counte&s;s of
Richmond, opened the fir&s;t propo&s;als of &s;uch an union
to that lady; and the &s;cheme appeared &s;o advantageous
for her &s;on, and, at the &s;ame time, &s;o likely to &s;ucceed,
that it admitted not of the lea&s;t he&s;itation. Dr. Lewis,
a Wel&s;h phy&s;ician, who had acce&s;s to the Queen-dowager
in her &s;anctuary, carried the propo&s;als to her;
and found, that revenge for the murder of her brother
and of her three &s;ons, apprehen&s;ions for her &s;urviving
family, re&s;entment of her confinement and oppre&s;&s;ions,
ea&s;ily overcame all her prejudices again&s;t: the hou&s;e of
Lanca&s;ter, and procured her approbation of a marriage,
to which the age and birth, as well as the pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion,
of the two parties, &s;eemed &s;o naturally to invite
them. She &s;ecretly borrowed a &s;um of money in the
city, &s;ent it over to the earl of Richmond, required his
oath to fulfil the marriage as &s;oon as he &s;hould arrive in
England, advi&s;ed him to levy as many foreign forces as
<PB N="303" REF="321">
po&s;&s;ible, and promi&s;ed to join him, on his fir&s;t appear|ance,
with all the friends and partizans of her family.</P>
<P>THE plan being thus laid upon the &s;olid foundations
of good &s;en&s;e and found policy, it was &s;ecretly com|municated
to the principal per&s;ons of both parties in all
the counties of England; and a wonderful alacrity ap|peared
in every order of men, to forward its &s;ucce&s;s and
completion. But it was impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;o exten&s;ive a
con&s;piracy could be conducted &s;o &s;ecretly as entirely to
e&s;cape the jealous and vigilant eye of Richard; and he
&s;oon received intelligence, that his enemies, headed by
the duke of Buckingham, were forming &s;ome de&s;ign
again&s;t his authority. He immediately put him&s;elf in a
po&s;ture of defence by levying &s;ome troops in the North;
and he &s;ummoned the duke to appear at court, in &s;uch
terms as &s;eemed to promi&s;e him a renewal of their for|mer
friend&s;hip. But that nobleman, well acquainted
with the barbarity and treachery of Richards replied only
by taking arms in Wales, and giving the &s;ignal to his
accomplices for a general in&s;urrecion in all parts of Eng|land.
But there happened at that very time to fall &s;uch
heavy rains,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October.</NOTE> &s;o ince&s;&s;ant and continued, as exceeded any
known in the memory of man; and the Severne, with
the other rivers in that neighbourhood, &s;welled to a
height which rendered them impa&s;&s;able, and prevented
Buckingham from marching into the heart of England
to join his a&s;&s;ociates. The Wel&s;hmen, partly moved
by &s;uper&s;tition at this extraordinary event, partly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
by famine in their camp, fell off from him; and Buck|ingham
finding him&s;elf de&s;erted by his followers, put
on a di&s;gui&s;e, and took &s;helter in the hou&s;e of Bani&s;ter,
an old &s;ervant of his family. But being detected in his
retreat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bucking|ham exe|cuted.</NOTE> he was brought to the King at Sali&s;bury; and
was in&s;tantly tried, condemned, and executed, according
<PB N="304" REF="322" MS="Y">
to the &s;ummary method practi&s;ed in tho&s;e ages<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Croyl. cont. p. 568.</NOTE>. The
other con&s;pirators, who took arms in four different
places, at Exeter, at Sali&s;bury, at Newbury, at Maid|&s;tone,
hearing of the duke of Buckingham's misfortunes,
de&s;paired of &s;ucce&s;s, and immediately di&s;per&s;ed them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE marquis of Dor&s;et and bi&s;hop of Ely made their
e&s;cape beyond &s;ea: Many others were equally fortunate.
Several fell into Richard's hands, of whom he made
&s;ome examples. His executions &s;eem not to have been
remarkably &s;evere; tho' we are told of one gentleman,
William Colingbourne, who &s;uffered under colour of this
rebellion, but in reality for a di&s;tich of quibbling ver&s;es,
which he had compo&s;ed again&s;t Richard and his mini|&s;ters<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>The lines were:
<Q><L>The Rat, the Cat, and Lovel that Dog,</L>
<L>Rule all England under the Hog.</L></Q>
Alluding to the names of Ratcliffe and Cate&s;by; and to Richard's arms, which were a boar.</P></NOTE>.
The earl of Richmond, in concert with his
friends, had &s;et fail from St. Malo's, carrying on board
a body of 5000 men, levied in foreign parts; but his
fleet being at fir&s;t drove back by a &s;torm, he appeared not
on the coa&s;t of England till after the di&s;per&s;ion of all his
friends; and he found him&s;elf obliged $word$ return to the
court of Brittany.</P>
<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1484.</NOTE> thus triumphant in all places, and
&s;trengthened by this un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt to dethrone
him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d of Jan.</NOTE> ventured at la&s;t to &s;ummon a parliament; a mea|&s;ure
which his crimes and flagrant u&s;urpation had made
him hitherto decline. Tho' it was natural that the par|liament,
in a conte&s;t of national parties, &s;hould always
<PB N="305" REF="323">
adhere to the victor, he &s;eems to have apprehended, le&s;t
his title, founded on no principle, and &s;upported by no
party, might be rejected by that a&s;&s;embly. But his
enemies being now at his feet, the parliament had no
choice but to recognize his authority, and acknowledge
his right to the crown. His only &s;on Edward, then a
youth of twelve years of age, was created prince of
Wales: The duties of tonnage and poundage were
granted him for life: And Richard, in order to recon|cile
the nation to his government, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome popular
laws, particularly one again&s;t the late practice of extort|ing
money on pretence of benevolences.</P>
<P>ALL the other mea&s;ures of the King tended to the
&s;ame object. Sen&s;ible, that the only circum&s;tance which
could give him &s;ecurity was to gain the confidence of
the Yorki&s;ts, he paid court to the Queen-dowager with
&s;uch art and addre&s;s, made &s;uch earne&s;t prote&s;tations of
his &s;incere good-will and friend&s;hip, that this prince&s;s,
tired of confinement, and de&s;pairing of any &s;ucce&s;s from
her former projects, ventured to leave her &s;anctuary, and
to put her&s;elf and her daughters into the hands of the
tyrant. But he &s;oon carried farther his views for the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of his throne. He had married Anne, the
&s;econd daughter of the earl of Warwic, and widow of
Edward prince of Wales, whom Richard him&s;elf had
murdered; but this prince&s;s having born him but one
&s;on, who died about this time, he con&s;idered her as an
invincible ob&s;tacle to the &s;ettlement of his fortune, and
be was believed to have carried her off by poi&s;on; a
crime for which the public could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have
any very &s;olid proof, but which the u&s;ual tenor of his
conduct made it rea&s;onable to &s;u&s;pect. He now thought
it in his power to remove the chief perils which threaten|ed
his government. The earl of Richmond, he knew
<PB N="306" REF="324">
could never be dangerous but from his projected mar|riage
with the prince&s;s Elizabeth, the true heir of the
crown; and he therefore intended, by means of a papal
di&s;pen&s;ation, to e&s;pou&s;e him&s;elf this prince&s;s, and thus to
unite in his own family their contending titles. The
Queen-dowager, eager to recover her lo&s;t authority,
neither &s;crupled this alliance, which was very unu&s;ual
in England, and was regarded as ince&s;tuous; nor felt
any horror at marrying her daughter to the murderer of
her three &s;ons and of her brother: She even conjoined
&s;o far her intere&s;ts with tho&s;e of the u$urper, that &s;he
wrote to all her partizans, and among the re&s;t to her &s;on
the marquis of Dor&s;et, de&s;iring them to withdraw from
the earl of Richmond; an injury which, the earl could
never afterwards forgive: The court of Rome was ap|plied
to for a di&s;pen&s;ation: Richard thought, that he
could ea&s;ily defend him&s;elf during the interval, till it
arrived; and he had afterwards the agreeable pro&s;pect
of a full and &s;ecure &s;ettlement. He flattered him&s;elf,
that the Engli&s;h nation, &s;eeing all danger removed of
a di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, would then acquie&s;ce under the
dominion of a prince, who was of mature years, of great
abilities, and of a genius qualified for government; and
that they would forgive him all the crimes which he had
committed in paving his way to the throne.</P>
<P>BUT the crimes of Richard were &s;o horrid and &s;o
&s;hocking to humanity, that the natural &s;entiments of
men, without any political or public views, were &s;uffi|cient
to render his government un&s;table; and every per|&s;on
of probity and honour was earne&s;t to prevent the
&s;ceptre from being farther polluted by that bloody and
treacherous hand which held it. All the exiles flocked
to the earl of Richmond in Brittany, and exhorted him
to ha&s;ten his attempt of a new inva&s;ion, and to prevent
<PB N="307" REF="325">
the marriage of the prince&s;s Elizabeth, which mu&s;t prove
&s;o fatal to all his hopes. The earl, &s;en&s;ible of the urgent
nece&s;&s;ity, but dreading the treachery of Peter Landais,
who had entered into a negotiation with Richard for
delivering him up, was obliged to attend only to his
pre&s;ent &s;afety; and he made his e&s;cape to the court of
France. The mini&s;ters of Charles VIII. who had now
&s;ucceeded to the throne after the death of his father
Lewis, gave him countenance and protection; and being
de&s;irous of rai&s;ing di&s;turbances to Richard, they &s;ecretly
encouraged the earl in the levies which he made for the
&s;upport of his enterprize again&s;t England. The earl of
Oxford, whom Richard's &s;u&s;picions had thrown into
confinement, having made his e&s;cape, here joined Henry;
and enflamed his ardour for the attempt, by the favour|able
accounts which he brought of the di&s;po&s;itions of the
Engli&s;h nations, and their univer&s;al hatred of Richard's
crimes and u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>THE earl of Richmond &s;et out from Harfleur in Nor|mandy<NOTE PLACE="marg">1485.</NOTE>
with a retinue of about 2000 per&s;ons;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion by the earl of Richmond. 7th of Au|gu&s;t.</NOTE> and after a
navigation of &s;ix days, he arrived at Milford-Haven in
Wales, where he landed without oppo&s;ition. He di|rected
his cour&s;e to that part of the kingdom, in hopes
that the Wel&s;h, who regarded him as their countryman,
and who had been already prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of his
cau&s;e by means of the duke of Buckingham, would join
his &s;tandard, and enable him to make $ead again&s;t the
e&s;tabli&s;hed government. Richard, who knew not in
what quarter he might expect the invader, had taken
po&s;t at Nottingham, in the centre of the kingdom; and
having given commi&s;&s;ions to different per&s;ons in the &s;eve|ral
counties, whom he empowered to oppo&s;e his enemy,
he propo&s;ed in per&s;on to fly, on the fir&s;t alarm, to the
<PB N="308" REF="326">
place which was expo&s;ed to danger. Sir Rice ap
Thomas and Sir Walter Herbert were entru&s;ted with
this authority in Wales; but the former immediately de|&s;erted
to Henry; the &s;econd made but feeble oppo&s;ition
to him: And the earl, advancing towards Shrew&s;bury,
received every day &s;ome reinforcement from his partizans.
Sir Gilbert Talbot joined him with all the va&s;&s;als and
retainers of the family of Shrew&s;bury; Sir Thomas
Bourchier, Sir Walter Hungerford, brought their friends
to &s;hare his fortune; and the appearance of men of di|&s;tinction
in his camp made already his cau&s;e wear a fa|vourable
a&s;pect.</P>
<P>BUT the danger to which Richard was chiefly expo&s;ed,
proceeded not &s;o much from the zeal of his open enemies,
as from the infidelity of his pretended friends. Scarce
any nobleman of di&s;tinction was &s;incerely attached to his
cau&s;e, except the duke of Norfolk; and all tho&s;e who
feigned the mo&s;t loyalty were only watching an oppor|tunity
to betray and de&s;ert him. But the per&s;ons of
whom he entertained the greate&s;t &s;u&s;picion, were the
lords Stanley and his brother Sir William; who&s;e con|nexions
with the earl of Richmond, notwith&s;tanding
their profe&s;&s;ions of attachment to his per&s;on, were never
entirely forgot or overlooked by him. When he em|powered
lord Stanley to levy forces, he &s;till retained his
elde&s;t &s;on, lord Strange, as a pledge of his fidelity; and
that nobleman was, on this account, obliged to employ
great precaut$$ and re&s;erve in his proceedings. He
rai&s;ed a powerful body of his friends and retainers in
Che&s;hire and Lanca&s;hire, but without openly declaring
him&s;elf: And tho' Henry had received &s;ecret a&s;&s;urances
of his friendly intention, the armies on both &s;ides knew
not what to infer from, his equivocal behaviour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d Aug. Battle of Bo&s;worth.</NOTE> The
two rivals, at la&s;t, approached each other, at Bo&s;worth
near Leice&s;ter; Henry at the head of &s;ix thou&s;and men,
<PB N="309" REF="327">
Richard with an army of above double the number;
and a deci&s;ive action was every hour looked for between
them. Stanley, who commanded about &s;even thou&s;and
men, took care to po&s;t him&s;elf at Ather&s;tone, not far
from the expected field of battle; and he made &s;uch a
di&s;po&s;ition as enabled him on occa&s;ion to join either
party. Richard had too much &s;agacity not to di&s;cover
his intentions from the&s;e movements; but he kept the
&s;ecret from his own men for fear of di&s;couraging them:
He took not immediate revenge on Stanley's &s;on, as
&s;ome of his courtiers advi&s;ed him; becau&s;e he hoped that
&s;o valuable a pledge would induce the father to prolong
&s;till farther his ambiguous conduct: And he ha&s;tened to
decide by arms the quarrel with his competitor; being
certain, that a victory over the earl of Richmond
would enable him to take ample revenge of all his ene|mies,
open and concealed.</P>
<P>THE van of Richmond's army, con&s;i&s;ting of archers,
was commanded by John earl of Oxford: Sir Gilbert
Talbot led the right wing; Sir John Savage the left:
The earl him&s;elf, accompanied by his uncle, the earl
of Pembroke, placed him&s;elf in the main body. Richard
al&s;o took po&s;t in <HI>his</HI> main body, and entru&s;ted the com|mand
of his van to the duke of Norfolk: As his wings
were never engaged, we have not learned the names of
the &s;everal commanders. Soon after the battle began,
lord Stanley, who&s;e conduct in this whole affair di&s;covers
great precaution and abilities, appeared in the field, and
declared for the earl of Richmond. This mea&s;ure, which
was &s;o unexpected to the men, tho' not to their leaders,
had a proportional effect on both armies: It in&s;pired un|u&s;ual
courage into Henry's &s;oldiers; it threw Richard's
into di&s;may and confu&s;ion. The intrepid tyrant, &s;en&s;ible
of his de&s;perate &s;ituation, ca&s;t his eye around the field,
and perceiving his rival at no great di&s;tance, he drove
<PB N="310" REF="328">
again&s;t him with fury, in hopes, that either Henry's
death or his own would &s;oon decide the victory between
them. He killed with his own hands Sir William
Brandon, &s;tandard-bearer to the earl: He di&s;mounted
Sir John Cheyney: He was now within reach of Rich|mond
him&s;elf, who declined not the combat; when Sir
William Stanley, breaking in with his troops, &s;ur|rounded
Richard, who, fighting bravely to the la&s;t mo|ment,
was overwhelmed by the numbers of his ene|mies,
and peri&s;hed by a fate too mild and honourable<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death</NOTE>
for his multiplied and dete&s;table enormities. His men
every where &s;ought for &s;afety by flight.</P>
<P>THERE fell in this battle about 4000 men on the &s;ide
of the vanqui&s;hed; and among the&s;e the duke of Nor|folk,
the lord Ferrars of Chartley, Sir Richard Rat|cliffe,
Sir Robert Piercy, and Sir Robert Brakenbury.
The lo&s;s was very incon&s;iderable on the &s;ide of the vic|tors.
Sir William Cate&s;by, a great in&s;trument of Ri|chard's
crimes, was taken, and &s;oon after beheaded, with
&s;ome others, at Leice&s;ter, The body of Richard was
found in the field, covered with dead enemies, and all
be&s;meared with blood: It was thrown carele&s;sly acro&s;s
a hor&s;e; was carried to Leice&s;ter amid the &s;houts of the
in&s;ulting &s;pectators; and was interred in the Gray-Friars
church of that place.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;torians who favour Richard (for even he has<NOTE PLACE="marg">and charac|ter of Rich|ard III.</NOTE>
met with partizans among the later writers) maintain,
that he was well qualified for government, had he legally
obtained it; and that he committed no crimes but &s;uch as
were nece&s;&s;ary to procure him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown:
But this is a very poor apology, when it is confe&s;&s;ed, that
he was ready to commit the mo&s;t horrid crimes, which
appeared nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e; and it is certain,
that all his courage and capacity, qualities in which he
really &s;eems not to have $een deficient, would never
<PB N="311" REF="329">
have made compen&s;ation to the people for the danger of
the precedent, and for the contagious example of vice
and murder, exalted upon the throne. This prince was
of a &s;mall &s;tature, hump-backed, and had a very har&s;h
di&s;agreeable vi&s;age; &s;o that his body was in every parti|cular
no le&s;s deformed than his mind.</P>
<P>THUS have we pur&s;ued the Hi&s;tory of England thro'
a &s;eries of many barbarous ages; till we have at la&s;t
reached the dawnings of civility and &s;cience, and have
the pro&s;pect, both of greater certainty in our hi&s;torical
narrations, and of being able to pre&s;ent to the reader
a &s;pectacle more worthy of his attention. The want
of certainty, however, and of circum&s;tances, is not alike
to be complained of throughout every period of this long
narration. This i&s;land po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es many antient hi&s;torians
of good credit, as well as many hi&s;torical monuments;
and it is rare, that the annals of &s;o uncultivated a people,
as were the Engli&s;h as well as the other European na|tions,
after the decline of Roman learning, have been
tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity &s;o compleat, and with &s;o little
mixture of fal&s;ehood and of fable. This advantage we
owe entirely to the clergy of the church of Rome; who,
founding their authority on their &s;uperior knowledge,
pre&s;erved the precious literature of antiquity from a total
extinction<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Every one that has peru&s;ed the ancient Monki&s;h writers, knows, that, however barbarous their own &s;tyle, they are full of allu&s;ions to the Latin cla&s;&s;ics, e&s;pecially the poets. There &s;eems al&s;o in tho&s;e middle ages to have remained many antient books, that are now lo&s;t. Malme&s;bury, who flouri&s;hed in the reign of Henry I. and King Stephen, quotes Livy's de&s;cription of Cae&s;ar's pa&s;&s;age over the Rubicon Fitz-Stephen, who lived in the reign of Henry II. alludes to a pa&s;&s;age in the lar|ger hi&s;tory of Sallu&s;t. In the collection of letters, which pa&s;&s;es under the name of Thomas a Becket, we &s;ee how familiar all the antient hi&s;tory and ancient books were to the more ingenious and more dignified churchmen of that time, and con&s;equently how much that order of men mu&s;t have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the other members of the &s;ociety. That prelate and his friends call each other philo&s;ophers in all the cour&s;e of their corre&s;pondence, and con&s;ider the re&s;t of the world as &s;unk into total ignorance and barbari&s;m.</NOTE>; and under &s;helter of their numerous privi|leges
<PB N="312" REF="330">
and immunities, acquired a &s;ecurity by means of
the &s;uper&s;tition, which they would in vain have claimed,
from the ju&s;tice and humanity, of tho&s;e turbulent and
licentious ages. Nor is the &s;pectacle altogether unen|tertaining
and unin&s;tructive, which the hi&s;tory of tho&s;e
times pre&s;ents to us. The view of human manners and
actions, in all their variety of appearances, is both pro|fitable
and agreeable; and if the a&s;pect in &s;ome periods
&s;eems horrid and deformed, we may thence learn to
cheri&s;h with the greater anxiety that &s;cience and civi|lity
which has &s;o clo&s;e a connexion with virtue and hu|manity,
and which, as it is a &s;overeign antidote again&s;t
&s;uper&s;tition, is al&s;o the mo&s;t effectual remedy again&s;t
vice and di&s;orders of every kind.</P>
<P>THE ri&s;e, progress, perfection, and decline of art and
&s;cience, are curious objects of contemplation, and in|timately
connected with a narration of civil tran&s;actions.
The events of no particular period can be fully accounted
for, but by con&s;idering the degrees of advancement,
which men have reached in tho&s;e particulars.</P>
<P>THOSE who ca&s;t their eye on the general revolutions
of &s;ociety, will find, that, as all the improvements of the
human mind had reached nearly to their &s;tate of perfec|tion
about the age of Augu&s;tus, there was a &s;en&s;ible de|cline
from that point or period; and men thenceforth
relap&s;ed gradually into ignorance and barbari&s;m. The
<PB N="313" REF="331">
unlimited extent of the Roman empire, and the con&s;e|quent
de&s;poti&s;m of the monarchs, extingui&s;hed all emu|lation,
deba&s;ed the generous &s;pirits of men, and de|pre&s;&s;ed
that noble flame, by which all the refined arts
mu&s;t be cheri&s;hed and enlivened. The military govern|ment,
which &s;oon &s;ucceeded, rendered even the lives and
properties of men in&s;ecure and precarious; and proved
de&s;tructive to tho&s;e vulgar and more nece&s;&s;ary arts of
agriculture, manufactures, and commerce; and in the
end, to the military art and genius it&s;elf, by which
alone the immen&s;e fabric of the empire could be &s;up|ported.
The irruption of the barbarous nations, which
&s;oon followed, overwhelmed all human knowledge,
which was already far in its decline; and men &s;unk
every age deeper into ignorance, &s;tupidity, and &s;uper|&s;tition;
till the light of antient &s;cience and hi&s;tory, had
very nearly &s;uffered a total extinction in all the Euro|pean
nations.</P>
<P>BUT there is an ultimate point of depre&s;&s;ion, as well as
of exaltation, from which human affairs naturally return
in a contrary progre&s;s, and beyond which they &s;eldom
pa&s;s either in their advancement or decline. The pe|riod,
in which the people of Chri&s;tendom were the low|e&s;t
&s;unk in ignorance, and con&s;equently in di&s;orders of
every kind, may ju&s;tly be fixed at the eleventh century,
about the age of William the Conqueror; and from
that aera, the &s;un of &s;cience, beginning to re-a&s;cend,
threw out many gleams of light, which preceded the full
morning, when letters were revived in the fifteenth cen|tury.
The Danes and other northern people who had
&s;o long infe&s;ted all the coa&s;ts, and even the inland parts
of Europe, by their depredations, having now learned
the arts of tillage and agriculture, found a &s;ettled &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence
at home, and were no longer tempted to de&s;ert
<PB N="314" REF="332">
their indu&s;try, in order to &s;eek a precarious livelihood
by rapine and by the plunder of their neighbours. The
feudal governments al&s;o, among the more &s;outhern na|tions,
were reduced to a kind of &s;y&s;tem; and tho' that
&s;trange &s;pecies of civil polity was ill fitted to en&s;ure ei|ther
liberty or tranquillity, it was preferable to the uni|ver&s;al
licence and di&s;order, which had every where pre|ceded
it. But perhaps there was no event, which tended
farther to the improvement of the age, than one, which
has not been much remarked, the accidental finding a
copy of Ju&s;tinian's Pandects, about the year 1130, in
the town of Amalfi in Italy.</P>
<P>THE eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who had lei&s;ure, and &s;ome incli|nation
to &s;tudy, immediately adopted with zeal this ex|cellent
&s;y&s;tem of juri&s;prudence, and &s;pread the knowledge
of it in every part of Europe. Be&s;ides the intrin&s;ic merit
of the performance, it was recommended to them by its
original connexion with the imperial city of Rome,
which, being the &s;eat of their religion &s;eemed to ac|quire
a new lu&s;tre and authority, by the diffu&s;ion
of its laws over the we&s;tern world. In le&s;s than
ten years after the di&s;covery of the Pandects, Va|carius,
under the protection of Theobald, archbi&s;hop
of Canterbury, read public lectures of civil law in the
univer&s;ity of Oxford; and the clergy every where, by
their example as well as exhortation, were the means
of &s;preading the highe&s;t e&s;teem for this new &s;cience.
That order of men, having large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to defend,
were in a manner nece&s;&s;itated to turn their &s;tudies to|wards
the law; and their properties being often endan|gered
by the violence of the princes and barons, it be|came
their interest to enforce the ob&s;ervance of general
and equitable rules, from which alone they could re|ceive
protection. As they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the knowledge
<PB N="315" REF="333">
of the age, and were alone acquainted with the habits
of thinking, the practice as well as &s;cience of the law,
fell mo&s;tly into their hands: And tho' the clo&s;e connex|ion,
which without any nece&s;&s;ity they formed between
the canon and civil law, begot a jealou&s;y in the laity of
England, and prevented the Roman juri&s;prudence from
becoming the municipal law of the country, as was the
ca&s;e in many &s;tates of Europe, a great part of it was
&s;ecretly transferred into the practice of the courts of ju|&s;tice,
and the imitation of their neighbours, made the
Engli&s;h gradually endeavour to rai&s;e their own law from
its original &s;tate of rudene&s;s and imperfection.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to &s;ee what advantages Europe mu&s;t have
reaped by its inheriting at once from the antients, &s;o
complete an art, which was of it&s;elf &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for
giving &s;ecurity to all other arts, and which, by refining,
and &s;till more, by be&s;towing &s;olidity on the judgment,
&s;erved as a model to further improvements. The &s;en|&s;ible
utility of the Roman law both to public and pri|vate
intere&s;t recommended the &s;tudy of it, at a time
when the more exalted and &s;peculative &s;ciences carried
no charms with them; and thus the la&s;t branch of antient
literature, which remained uncorrupted, was happily the
fir&s;t tran&s;mitted to the modern world. For it is remark|able,
that in the decline of Roman learning, when the
philo&s;ophers were univer&s;ally infected with &s;uper&s;tition
and &s;ophi&s;try, and the poets and hi&s;trorians with barba|ri&s;m,
the lawyers, who in other countries are &s;eldom
models of &s;cience or politene&s;s, were yet able, by the
con&s;tant &s;tudy and clo&s;e imitation of their predece&s;&s;ors,
to maintain the &s;ame good &s;en&s;e in their deci&s;ions and
rea&s;onings, and the &s;ame purity in their language and
expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>WHAT be&s;towed an additional merit on the civil law,
was the extreme ignorance and imperfection of that ju|ri&s;prudence,
<PB N="316" REF="334">
which preceded it among all the European
nations, e&s;pecially among the Saxons or antient Eng|li&s;h.
What ab&s;urdities prevailed at that time in the
admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, may be conceived from the au|thentic
monuments which remain of the antient Saxon
laws; where a pecuniary commutation was received for
every crime, where &s;tated prices were fixed for men's
lives and members, where private revenges were autho|rized
for all injuries, where the u&s;e of the ordeal, cor&s;|net,
and afterwards of the duel, was the received me|thod
of proof, and where the judges were ru&s;tic free|holders,
a&s;&s;embled of a &s;udden, and deciding a cau&s;e
from one debate or altercation of the parties. Such a
&s;tate of &s;ociety was very little advanced beyond the rude
&s;tate of nature: Violence univer&s;ally prevailed, in&s;tead
of general and equitable maxims: The pretended liberty
of the times, was only an incapacity of &s;ubmitting to
government; And men, not protected by law in their
lives and properties, &s;ought &s;helter, by their per&s;onal
&s;ervility and attachments, under &s;ome powerful chieftain,
or by voluntary combinations.</P>
<P>THE gradual progre&s;s of improvement, rai&s;ed the Eu|ropeans
&s;omewhat from this uncultivated &s;tate; and af|fairs,
in this i&s;land particularly, took very early a turn,
which was more favourable to ju&s;tice and to liberty.
Civil employments and occupations &s;oon became honour|able
among the Engli&s;h: The &s;ituation of that people
rendered not the perpetual attention to wars &s;o nece&s;&s;ary
as among their neighbours, and all regard was not con|fined
to the military profe&s;&s;ion: The gentry, and even
the nobility, began to deem an acquaintance with the
law, a requi&s;ite part of education: They were le&s;s di|verted
than afterwards from &s;tudies of this kind by other
&s;ciences; and in the age of Henry VI. we are told by
<PB N="317" REF="335">
Forte&s;cue, there were in the Inns of Court about two
thou&s;and &s;tudents, mo&s;t of them men of honourable
birth, who gave application to this branch of civil know|ledge.
A circum&s;tance which proves, that a con&s;iderable
advance was already made in the &s;cience of government,
and which progno&s;ticated &s;till a greater.</P>
<P>ONE chief advantage, which re&s;ulted from the intro|duction
and progre&s;s of the arts, was the introduction
and progre&s;s of freedom; and this con&s;equence affected
men both in their <HI>per&s;onal</HI> and <HI>civil</HI> capacities.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the antient &s;tate of Europe, we &s;hall
find, that the far greater part of the &s;ociety were every
where bereaved of their <HI>per&s;onal</HI> liberty, and lived en|tirely
at the will of their ma&s;ters. Every one, that
was not noble, was a &s;lave: The pea&s;ants were fold along
with the land: The few inhabitants of cities were not
in a better condition: Even the gentry them&s;elves were
&s;ubjected to a long; train of &s;ubordination under the
greater barons or chief va&s;&s;als of the crown; who, tho'
&s;eemingly placed in a high &s;tate of &s;plendor, yet, having
but a &s;lender protection from the law, were expo&s;ed to
every tempe&s;t of &s;tate, and by the precarious con|dition,
in which they lived, paid dearly for the power
of oppre&s;&s;ing and tyrannizing over their inferiors. The
fir&s;t incident, which broke in upon this violent &s;y&s;tem
of government, was the practice, begun in France, of
erecting communities and corporations, endowed with
privileges and a &s;eparate municipal government, which
gave them protection again&s;t the tyranny of the barons,
and which the prince him&s;elf deemed it prudent to re|&s;pect<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">There appear early &s;ymptoms of the jealou&s;y, entertained by the barons again&s;t the progre&s;s of the arts, as de&s;tructive of their licentious power. A law was enacted, 7 Henry IV. cap. 17. prohibiting any one who did not po&s;&s;e&s;s twenty &s;hillings a-year in land from binding his &s;ons apprentices to any trade. They found already that the cities began to drain the country of the labourers and hu&s;bandmen; and did not fore&s;ee how much the encrea&s;e of commerce would increa&s;e the value of their e&s;tates. See farther, Cotton, p. 170. The Kings, to encourage the boroughs, granted them this privilege, that any villain, who had lived a twelvemonth in any corporation and had been of the gild, &s;hould be thenceforth regarded as free.</NOTE>.
The relaxation of the feudal tenures, and an
<PB N="318" REF="336">
execution, &s;omewhat &s;tricter, of the public law, be&s;tow|ed
an independence on va&s;&s;als, which was unknown to
their forefathers. And even the pea&s;ants them&s;elves,
tho' later than other orders of the &s;tate, made their e&s;cape
from tho&s;e bonds of villenage or &s;lavery, in which they
had formerly been retained.</P>
<P>IT may appear &s;trange, that the progre&s;s of the arts,
which &s;eems among the Greeks and Romans, to have
daily encrea&s;ed the number of &s;laves, &s;hould, in later
times, have proved &s;o general a &s;ource of liberty; but
this difference of the events proceeded from a great dif|ference
in the circum&s;tances, which attended tho&s;e in|&s;titutions.
The antient barons, being obliged to main|tain
them&s;elves continually in a military po&s;ture, and
little emulous of elegance or &s;plendor, employed not
their villains as dome&s;tic &s;ervants, much le&s;s as manu|facturers,
but compo&s;ed their retinue of free-men, who&s;e
military &s;pirit; rendered the chieftain formidable to his
neighbours, and, who were ready to attend him in every
warlike enterprize. The villains were occupied entirely
in the cultivation of their ma&s;ter's land, and paid their
rents either in corn and cattle and other produce of the
farm, or in &s;ervile offices, which they performed about
the baron's family, and upon the farms which he retained
in his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. In proportion as agriculture im|proved,
and money encrea&s;ed, it was found, that the&s;e
<PB N="319" REF="337">
&s;ervices, tho' extremely burthen&s;ome to the villain, were
of little advantage to the ma&s;ter; and that the produce
of a large e&s;tate could be much more conveniently di&s;|po&s;ed
of by the pea&s;ant him&s;elf, who rai&s;ed it, than by
the landlord or his bailiff, who were formerly accu&s;tomed
to receive it. A commutation was therefore made of
rents for &s;ervices, and of money-rents for tho&s;e in kind;
and as men, in a &s;ub&s;equent age, di&s;covered, that farms
were better cultivated where the farmer enjoyed a &s;ecu|rity
of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the practice of granting lea&s;es to the
pea&s;ant began to prevail, which entirely broke the bonds
of &s;ervitude, already much relaxed from the former prac|tices.
After this manner, villenage went gradually into
difu&s;e throughout the more civilized parts of Europe: The
intere&s;t of the ma&s;ter, as well as that of the &s;lave, con|curred
in this alteration. The late&s;t laws which we
find in England for the enforcing or regulating this &s;pe|cies
of &s;ervitude, were enacted in the reign of Henry VII.
And tho' the antient &s;tatutes on this &s;ubject remain &s;till
unrepealed by parliament, it appears, that, before the
reign of Elizabeth, the di&s;tinction of villain and freeman
was totally, tho' in&s;en&s;ibly aboli&s;hed, and that no per&s;on
remained in the &s;tate, to whom the former laws could be
applied.</P>
<P>THUS <HI>per&s;onal</HI> freedom became almo&s;t general in Eu|rope;
an advantage which paved the way for the en|crea&s;e
of <HI>political</HI> or <HI>civil</HI> liberty, and which, even where
it was not attended with this &s;alutary effect, &s;erved to
give the members of the community &s;ome of the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable advantages of it.</P>
<P>THE con&s;titution of the Engli&s;h government, ever
&s;ince the inva&s;ion of this i&s;land by the Saxons, may
boa&s;t of this pre-eminence, that in no age the will of
the monarch was ever entirely ab&s;olute and uncontrouled:
<PB N="320" REF="338">
But in other re&s;pects the balance of power has extremely
&s;hifted among the &s;everal orders of the &s;tate; and this fa|bric
has experienced the &s;ame mutability, which has at|tended
all human in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>THE antient Saxons, like the other German nations,
where each individual was enured to arms, and where
the independance of men was &s;ecured by a great equa|lity
of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, &s;eem to have admitted a con&s;iderable
mixture of democracy into their form of government,
and to have been one of the free&s;t nations, of which
there remains any account in the records of hi&s;tory. Af|ter
this tribe was &s;ettled in England, e&s;pecially after the
di&s;&s;olution pf the Heptarchy, the great extent of the
kingdom produced a great inequality in property; and
the balance &s;eems to have inclined to the &s;ide of the
ari&s;tocracy. The Norman conque&s;t threw more autho|rity
into the hands of the &s;overeign, which, however, ad|mitted
of great controul; tho' derived le&s;s from the general
forms of the con&s;titution, which were inaccurate and
irregular, than from the independant power enjoyed by
each baron in his particular di&s;trict or province. The
e&s;tabli&s;hment of the great charter exalted &s;till higher the
Ari&s;tocracy, impo&s;ed regular limits on royal power, and
gradually introduced &s;ome mixture of Democracy into
the con&s;titution. But even during this period, from the
acce&s;&s;ion of Edward I. to the death of Richard III. the
condition of the commons was nowi&s;e de&s;irable; a kind
of Poli&s;h Ari&s;tocracy prevailed; and tho' the King$
were limited, the people were as yet far from being free.
It required the authority almo&s;t ab&s;olute of the &s;ove|reigns,
which, took place in the &s;ub&s;equent period, to
pull down the&s;e di&s;orderly and licentious tyrants, who
were equal enemies to peace and to freedom, and to
e&s;tabli&s;h that regular execution of the laws, which, in a
<PB N="321" REF="339">
following age, enabled the people to erect a regular and
equitable plan of liberty.</P>
<P>IN each of the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive alterations, the only rule
of government, which is intelligible or carries any au|thority
with it, is the e&s;tabli&s;hed practice of the age,
and the maxims of admini&s;tration, which are at that time
prevalent, and univer&s;ally a&s;&s;ented to. Tho&s;e who,
from a pretended re&s;pect to antiquity, appeal at every
turn to an original plan of the con&s;titution, only cover
their turbulent &s;pirit and their private ambition under the
appearance of venerable forms; and whatever period
they pitch on for their model, they may &s;till be carried
back to a more antient period, where they will find the
mea&s;ures of power entirely different, and where every
circum&s;tance, by rea&s;on of the greater barbarity of the
times, will appear &s;till le&s;s worthy of imitation. Above
all, a civilized nation, like the Engli&s;h, who have hap|pily
e&s;tabli&s;hed the mo&s;t perfect and mo&s;t accurate &s;y&s;tem
of liberty, that ever was found compatible with govern|ment,
ought to be cautious of appealing to the practice
of their ance&s;tors, or regarding the maxims of unculti|vated
ages as certain rules for their pre&s;ent conduct. An
acquaintance with the hi&s;tory of the antient, periods of
their government is chiefly <HI>u&s;eful</HI> by in&s;tructing them to
cheri&s;h their pre&s;ent con&s;titution from a compari&s;on or
contra&s;t with the condition of tho&s;e di&s;tant times. And
it is al&s;o <HI>curious,</HI> by &s;hewing them the remote, and com|monly
faint and disfigured originals of the mo&s;t fini&s;h|ed
and mo&s;t noble in&s;titutions, and by in&s;tructing them
in the great mixture of accident which commonly con|curs
with a &s;mall ingredient of wi&s;dom and forefight, in
erecting the complicated fabric of the mo&s;t perfect go|vernment.</P>

<P>THE victory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXIV.</NOTE> which the earl of Richmond gained
at Bo&s;worth over Richard the third, was entirely
deci&s;ive; being attended, as well with the total rout and
di&s;per&s;ion of the royal army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t 22.</NOTE> as with the death of the
King him&s;elf. The joy of &s;o great &s;ucce&s;s &s;uddenly
prompted the &s;oldiers, in the field of battle, to be&s;tow on
their victorious general the appellation of King, which
he had not hitherto a&s;&s;umed; and the acclamations of
<HI>Long live Henry thg &s;eventh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acce&s;&s;ion of Henry VII.</NOTE> by a natural and unpremedi|tated
movement, re&s;ounded from all quarters. To be|&s;tow
&s;ome appearance of formality on this &s;pecies of mi|litary
election, Sir William Stanley brought a crown of
ornament, which Richard wore in battle, and which
had been found among the &s;poils; and he put it on the
head of the conqueror. Henry him&s;elf remained not in
&s;u&s;pen&s;e; but immediately, without he&s;ttation, accepted
<PB N="323" REF="341">
of the magnificent pre&s;ent, which was tendered him.
He was come to the great cri&s;is of his fortune; and being
Obliged &s;uddenly to determine him&s;elf, amid&s;t great dif|ficulties,
which he mu&s;t have frequently revolved in his
mind, he cho&s;e that part, which his ambition &s;ugge&s;ted
to him, and to which he &s;eemed to be conducted by his
pre&s;ent pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE were many titles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His title to the crown.</NOTE> on which Henry could
found his right to the throne; but no one of them free
from grent objections, if con&s;idered, either with re&s;pect
to ju&s;tice or to policy.</P>
<P>DURING &s;ome years, Henry had been regarded as heir
to the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, by the party attached to that
family; but the title of the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter it&s;elf to
the crown was generally thought to be very ill founded.
Henry the fourth, who had fir&s;t rai&s;ed that family to
royal dignity, had never clearly determined the founda|tion
of his claim; and while he plainly invaded the or|der
of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, he had not acknowledged the election
of the people. The parliament had indeed often re|cognized
the title of the Lanca&s;trian princes; but the&s;e
votes had little authority, being con&s;idered as in&s;tances
of prudent complai&s;ance towards a family in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
pre&s;ent power: And they had accordingly been often
rever&s;ed during the late prevalence of the hou&s;e of
York. Prudent men al&s;o, who had been willing, for the
&s;ake of peace, to &s;ubmit to any e&s;tabli&s;hed authority,
de&s;ired not to &s;ee the claims of a family revived, which
mu&s;t produce many convul&s;ions at pre&s;ent, and which
di&s;|jointed
for the future the whole &s;y&s;tem of hereditary
right. Be&s;ides; allowing the title of the hou&s;e of Lan|ca&s;ter
to be legal, Henry him&s;elf was not the true heir
of that family; and nothing but the ob&s;tinacy, natural
to a faction, which never, without the utmo&s;t reluctance,
<PB N="324" REF="342">
will &s;ubmit to their antagoni&s;ts, could have engaged the
partizans of that hou&s;e to adopt the earl of Richmond
us their head. His mother indeed, Margaret, counte&s;s
of Richmond, was &s;ole daughter and heir of the hou&s;e
of Somer&s;et, de&s;cended from John of Gaunt duke of
Lanca&s;ter: But the birth of the fir&s;t of the Somer&s;et line
was it&s;elf illegitimate and even adulterous. And tho'
the duke of Lanca&s;ter had obtained the legitimation of
his natural children by a patent from Richard the &s;econd,
confirmed in parliament; it might ju&s;tly be doubted,
whether this deed could be&s;tow any title to the crown;
&s;ince in the patent it&s;elf all the privileges conferred by
it are fully enumerated, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the king|dom
is expre&s;ly excluded<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. vii. p. 849. Coke's In&s;t. 4 In&s;t. part 1. p. 37.</NOTE>. In all the &s;ettlements of the
crown, made during the reigns of the Lanca&s;trian princes,
the line of Somer&s;et had been entirely overlooked; and
it was not till the failure of the legitimate branch, that
men had paid any attention to their claim. And to add
to the general di&s;&s;atisfaction again&s;t Henry's title, his
mother, from whom he derived all his right, was &s;till
alive; and evidently preceded him in the order of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>THE title of the hou&s;e of York, both from the plain
rea&s;on of the ca&s;e, and from the late popular govern|ment
of Edward the fourth, had obtained univer&s;ally
the preference in the &s;entiments of the people; and
Henry might engraft his claim on the right of that fa|mily,
by his intended marriage with the prince&s;s Eli|zabeth,
the heire&s;s of it; a marriage, which he had &s;o|lemnly
promi&s;ed to celebrate, and to the expectation of
which he had chiefly owed all his pa&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es. But
many rea&s;ons di&s;&s;uaded Henry from adopting this expe|dient.
<PB N="325" REF="343">
Were he to receive the crown only in right of
his &s;pou&s;e, his power, he knew, would be very limited;
and he mu&s;t expect rather to enjoy the bare title of King
by a &s;ort of courte&s;y, than po&s;&s;e&s;s the real authority
which belongs to it. Should the prince&s;s die before him
without i&s;&s;ue, he mu&s;t de&s;cend from the throne, and
give place to the next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: And even, if his
bed &s;hould be ble&s;t with offspring, it &s;eemed dangerous
to expect, that filial piety in his children would prevail
over the ambition of obtaining pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of re|gal
power. An act of parliament, indeed, might be
ea&s;ily procured to &s;ettle the crown on him during his life;
but Henry knew how much &s;uperior the claim of &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
by blood was to the votes of an a&s;&s;embly<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bacon in Kennet's compleat Hi&s;tory, p. 579.</NOTE>, which
had always been overborne by violence in the &s;hock of
contending titles, and which had ever been more go|verned
by the conjunctures of the times, than by any
con&s;iderations derived from rea&s;on or public intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THERE was yet a third foundation, on which Henry
might re&s;t his claim, the right of conque&s;t, by his victory
over Richard, the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the crown. But
be&s;ides that Richard him&s;elf was deemed no better than
an u&s;urper, the army, which fought again&s;t him, con|&s;i&s;ted
chiefly of Engli&s;hmen; and a right of conque&s;t
over England could never be e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;uch a victo|ry.
Nothing al&s;o would give greater umbrage to the
nation than a claim of this nature; which might be
con&s;trued as an abolition of all their rights and privi|leges,
and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of de&s;potic authority in the
&s;overeign<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 579.</NOTE>. William him&s;elf, the Norman, tho' at the
head of a powerful and victorious army of foreigners,
had at fir&s;t declined the invidious title of conqueror; and
<PB N="326" REF="344">
it was not till the full e&s;tabli&s;hment of his authority,
that he had ventured to advance &s;o violent and de&s;tructive
a preten&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT Henry knew, that there was another foundation
of authority, &s;omewhat re&s;embling the right of conque&s;t,
to wit, pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and that this title, guarded
by vigour and ability, would be &s;ufficient to &s;ecure per|petual
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne. He had before him the
example of Henry the fourth; who, &s;upported by no
better preten&s;ion, had &s;ubdued many in&s;urrections, and
had been able to tran&s;mit the crown peaceably to his
po&s;terity. He was &s;en&s;ible, that this title, which had
been perpetuated thro' three &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of the family of
Lanca&s;ter, might &s;till have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, notwith&s;tanding the
preferable claim of the hou&s;e of York; had not the &s;cep|ter
devolved into the hands of Henry the &s;ixth, which
were too feeble to &s;u&s;tain it. In&s;tructed by the&s;e re|cent
experiences, Henry was determined to put him&s;elf
in pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of regal authority; and to &s;how all
oppo&s;ers, that nothing but force of arms and a &s;uc|ce&s;sful
war &s;hould be able to expel him. His claim as
heir to the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter he was re&s;olved to ad|vance;
and never allow it to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed: And he
hoped that this title, favoured by the partizans of that
family, and &s;econded by pre&s;ent power, would &s;ecure him
a perpetual and an independant authority.</P>
<P>THESE views of Henry are not expo&s;ed to much
blame; becau&s;e founded on good policy, and even on a
&s;pecies of nece&s;&s;ity: But there entered into all his mea&s;ures
and councils another motive, which admits not of the
&s;ame apology.<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's pre|judice a|gain&s;t the hou&s;e of York.</NOTE> The violent contentions, which during
&s;o long a period, had been maintained between the rival
of families of York and Lanca&s;ter, and the many &s;an|guinary
revenges which they had mutually exerci&s;ed
<PB N="327" REF="345">
on each other, had inflamed the oppo&s;ite factions to
a high pitch of animo&s;ity. Henry him&s;elf, who had &s;een
mo&s;t of his near friends and relations peri&s;h in the field or
on the &s;caffold, and who had been expo&s;ed in his own
per&s;on to many hard&s;hips and dangers, had imbibed a
violent antipathy to the York, party, which no time nor
experience were ever able to efface. In&s;tead of em|bracing
the pre&s;ent happy opportunity of aboli&s;hing the&s;e
fatal di&s;tinctions, of uniting his title with that of his
&s;pou&s;e, and of be&s;towing favour indi&s;criminately on the
friends of both families; he carried into the throne all
the partialities which belong to the head of a faction,
and even the pa&s;&s;ions, which are carefully guarded again&s;t
by every true politician in that &s;ituation. To exalt the
Lanca&s;trian party, to depre&s;s the retainers of the hou&s;e
of York, were &s;till the favourite objects of his purfuit;
and thro' the whole cour&s;e of his reign, he never for|got
the&s;e early prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Incapable from his na|tural
temper of a more enlarged and more benevolent
&s;y&s;tem of policy, he expo&s;ed him&s;elf to many pre&s;ent in|conveniencies,
by too anxiou&s;ly guarding again&s;t that fu|ture
po&s;&s;ible event, which might disjoin his title from
that of the prince&s;s whom he e&s;pou&s;ed. And while he
treated the Yorki&s;ts as enemies, he &s;oon rendered them
&s;uch, and taught them to di&s;cu&s;s that right to the crown,
which he &s;o carefully kept &s;eparate; and to perceive its
weakne&s;s and invalidity.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions of Henry, as well as to his &s;u&s;pi|cious
politics, we are to a&s;cribe the mea&s;ure, which he
embraced two days after the battle of Bo&s;worth. Ed|ward
Plantagenet, earl of Warwic, &s;on to the unfor|tunate
duke of Clarence, was detained in a kind of con|&s;inement
at Sherif-Hutton in York&s;hire by the jealou&s;y
of his uncle, Richard; who&s;e title to the throne was
<PB N="328" REF="346">
inferior to that of the young prince. Warwic had now
rea&s;on to expect better treatment, as he was no ob&s;tacle
to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion either of Henry or Elizabeth; and from
a boy of &s;uch tender years no danger could rea&s;onably
be apprehended. But Sir Robert Willoughby was di&s;|patched
by Henry with orders to take him from Sherif-Hutton,
to convey him to the Tower, and to retain
him in clo&s;e cu&s;tody<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 579. Polydore Virgil, p. 565.</NOTE>. The &s;ame me&s;&s;enger carried di|rections,
that the prince&s;s Elizabeth, who had been con|fined
to the &s;ame place, &s;hould be conducted to Lon|don,
in order to meet Henry, and there celebrate her
e&s;pou&s;als.</P>
<P>HENRY him&s;elf &s;et out for the capital, and advanced
by &s;low journies. Not to rou&s;e the jealou&s;y of the people,
he took, care to avoid all appearance of military triumph;
and &s;o to re&s;train the in&s;olence of victory, that every
thing about him bore the appearance of an e&s;tabli&s;hed
monarch, making a peaceable progre&s;s thro' his domi|nions,
rather than of a prince who had opened a way to
the throne by force of arms.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His joyful reception in London.</NOTE> The acclamations of the
people were every where loud, and no le&s;s &s;incere and
hearty._ Be&s;ides that a young and victorious prince, on
his acce&s;&s;ion, was naturally the object of popularity;
the nation promi&s;ed them&s;elves great felicity from the
new &s;cene, which opened before them. During the
cour&s;e of near a whole century the kingdom had been
laid wa&s;te by dome&s;tic wars and convul&s;ions; and if at
any time the noi&s;e of arms had cea&s;ed, the &s;ound of
faction and di&s;content &s;till threatened new di&s;orders.
Henry, by his marriage with Elizabeth, &s;eemed to en|&s;ure
an union of the contending titles of the two fami|lies;
and having prevailed over a hated tyrant, who had
<PB N="329" REF="347">
anew disjointed the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion even of the hou&s;e of York,
and filled his own family with blood and murder, an un|feigned
favour was ob&s;erved every where to attend him.
Numerous and &s;plendid troops of gentry and nobility
accompanied his progre&s;s. The mayor and companies of
London received him as he approached the city: The
crouds of people and citizens were zealous in their expre&s;|&s;ions
of &s;atisfaction. But Henry, amid&s;t the&s;e general
effu&s;ions of joy, di&s;covered &s;till the &s;tateline&s;s and re&s;erve
of his temper, which made him &s;corn to court populari|ty:
He entered London in a clo&s;e chariot, and would not
gratify the people with a &s;ight of their new monarch.
He went fir&s;t to St. Paul's church, where he offered
up the &s;tandards, taken in the field of battle; and &s;ung
ori&s;ons for the victory, which he had there obtained.
He departed thence to the bi&s;hop of London's palace,
where lodgings were prepared for him.</P>
<P>BUT Henry did not &s;o much neglect the favour of the
people, as to delay giving them a&s;&s;urance of his marri|age
with the prince&s;s Elizabeth, which he knew to be
&s;o pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired by the whole nation. On his
leaving Brittany, he had artfully dropt &s;ome hopes, that,
if he &s;hould &s;ucceed in his enterprize, and obtain the
crown of England, he would e&s;pou&s;e Anne, the heire&s;s
of that dutchy; and the report of this engagement had
already reached England, and had begot anxiety in the
people, and even in the prince&s;s Elizabeth her&s;elf. Henry
took care to di&s;&s;ipate the&s;e apprehen&s;ions, by &s;olemnly re|newing,
before the council and principal nobility, the promi&s;e,
which he had already given, to celebrate his
marriage with Elizabeth. But tho' bound by honour,
as well as intere&s;t, to compleat this alliance, he was re|&s;olved
to po&s;tpone it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His coro|nation.</NOTE> till the ceremony of his own coro|nation
&s;hould be fini&s;hed, and till his title &s;hould be re|cognized

<PB N="330" REF="350">
by the parliament. Anxious &s;till to &s;upport
his per&s;onal and hereditary right to the throne, he dreaded
le&s;t a preceding marriage with the prince&s;s &s;hould inply a
participation of &s;overeignty in her, and rai&s;e doubts of
his own title by the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter.</P>
<P>THERE raged at that time in London, and other parts
of the kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sweating &s;ickne&s;s.</NOTE> a &s;pecies of malady, unknown to any
other age or nation, the Sweating &s;ickne&s;s, which occa|&s;ioned
a &s;udden death to great multitudes; tho' it was
not propagated by any contagious infection, but aro&s;e
from the general di&s;po&s;ition of the air and of the human
body. In le&s;s than twenty-four hours the patient com|monly
died or recovered; but when the pe&s;tilence had
committed ravages for a few weeks, it was ob&s;erved, ei|ther
from alterations in the air, or from a more proper re|gimen,
which had been di&s;covered, to be considerably
abated<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 567.</NOTE>. Preparations were then made for the ceremony
of Henry's coronation. In order to heighten the &s;plen|dor
of that appearance, he be&s;towed the rank of knights
banneret on twelve per&s;ons; and he conferred peerages
on three. Ja&s;per earl of Pembroke, his uncle, he created
duke of Bedford; Thomas lord Stanley, his father-in-law,
earl of Derby; and Edward Courteney, earl of
Devon&s;hire.<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th of October.</NOTE> At the coronation likewi&s;e there appeared
a new in&s;titution, which the King had e&s;tabli&s;hed for &s;e|curity
as well as pomp, a band of fifty archers, who
were denominated yeomen of the guard. But le&s;t the
people &s;hould take umbrage at this unu&s;ual &s;ymptom of
jealou&s;y in the prince, as if it implied a per&s;onal diffi|dence
of his &s;ubjects, he declared the in&s;titution to be
perpetual. The ceremony of coronation was performed
by cardinal Bourchier, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="351">
THE parliament being a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter, the
majority immediately appeared to be devoted partizans
of Henry; all per&s;ons of another di&s;po&s;ition, either de|clining
to &s;tand in the&s;e dangerous times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th of No|vember. A parlia|ment.</NOTE> or being ob|liged
to di&s;&s;emble their principles and inclinations. The
Lanca&s;trian party had every where been &s;ucce&s;sful in the
elections; and even many of them had been returned
knights and burge&s;&s;es, who, during the prevalence of the
hou&s;e of York, had been expo&s;ed to the rigour of the
law, and been condemned by &s;entence of attainder or
outlawry. Their right to take &s;eats in the hou&s;e being
que&s;tioned, the ca&s;e was re&s;erred to all the judges, who
a&s;&s;embled in the Exchequer Chamber, in order to deli|berate
on &s;o delicate a &s;ubject. The &s;entence pronounced
was very prudent, and contained a ju&s;t temperament be|tween
law and expediency<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 581.</NOTE>. The judges determined,
that the members attainted &s;hould forbear taking their
feats till an act were pa&s;&s;ed for the rever&s;al of their at|tainder.
There was no difficulty of obtaining this act;
and in it were comprehended an hundred and &s;even per|&s;ons
of the King's party<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rot. Parl. 1 Hen. VII. n. 2, 3, 4.&mdash;15. 17. 26&mdash;65.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>BUT a difficulty was &s;tarted of a nature &s;till more im|portant.
The King him&s;elf had been attainted; and
his right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown might thence be ex|po&s;ed
to &s;ome doubt. The judges extricated them&s;elves
from this dangerous que&s;tion, by a &s;ingular po&s;ition,
which they e&s;tabli&s;hed; &startq;That the crown takes away
all defects and flops in blood; and that from the time
the King a&s;&s;umed royal authority, the fountain was
cleared, and all attainders and corruptions of blood
di&s;charged<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 58$.</NOTE>.&endq; Be&s;ides that the ca&s;e, from its urgent
<PB N="332" REF="352">
nece&s;&s;ity, admitted of no deliberation; the judges pro|bably
thought, that no &s;entence of a court of judicature
ought to bar the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; that the jealou&s;y of
a King towards his heir might readily occa&s;ion &s;tretches
of law and ju&s;tice again&s;t him; and that a prince might
even be engaged in unju&s;tifiable mea&s;ures during his pre|dece&s;&s;or's
reign, without meriting on that account to be
excluded from the throne, which was his birth-right.</P>
<P>WITH a parliament &s;o ob&s;equious as the pre&s;ent, the
King could not fail to obtain whatever act of &s;ettlement
he was plea&s;ed to require. He &s;eems only to have en|tertained
&s;ome doubts within him&s;elf on what title he
&s;hould found his preten&s;ions. In his fir&s;t addre&s;s to the
parliament he mentioned his ju&s;t title by hereditary right:
But le&s;t that title &s;hould not be e&s;teemed &s;ufficient, he
&s;ubjoined his claim by the judgment of God, who had
given him victory over his enemies in the field of battle. And
again, le&s;t this preten&s;ion &s;hould be interpreted as
a&s;&s;uming a right of conque&s;t, he en&s;ured to his &s;ubjects
the entire enjoyment of their former properties and po&s;|&s;effions.</P>
<P>THE entail of the crown was drawn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Entail of the crown.</NOTE> according to the
&s;en&s;e of the King, and probably in the words, dictated
by him. He made no mention in it of the prince&s;s Eli|zabeth,
nor any branch of the family of York; but in
other re&s;pects the act was compo&s;ed with &s;ufficient re|&s;erve
and moderation. He did not in&s;i&s;t, that it &s;hould
contain a declaration or recognition of his preceding
right; as on the other hand, he avoided the appearance
of a new law or ordinance. He cho&s;e a middle cour&s;e,
which, as is generally unavoidable in &s;uch ca&s;es, was
not entirely free from uncertainty and ob&s;curity. It was
voted, &startq;That the inheritance of the crown &s;hould re&s;t,
<PB N="333" REF="353">
remain, and abide in the King<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 581.</NOTE>;&endq; but whether as
rightful heir, or only as pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, was not deter|mined.
In like manner, the King was contented that
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hould be &s;ecured to the heirs of his body;
but he pretended not, in cafe of their failure, to exclude
the hou&s;e of York, or give the preference to that of
Lanca&s;ter: He left that great point ambiguous for the
pre&s;ent; and tru&s;ted, that, if ever its determination:
&s;hould become requi&s;ite, future incidents would open
the way for the deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT after all the&s;e precautions, the King was &s;o little
&s;atisfied with his own title to the crown, that, in the
following year, he applied to Rome for a confirmation of
it; and as that court gladly laid hold of all opportunities,
which the imprudence, weakne&s;s, or nece&s;&s;ities of princes
afforded it to extend its authority. Innocent the eighth,
the reigning pope, readily granted a bull, in whatever
terms the King was plea&s;ed to de&s;ire. All Henry's titles,
by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, marriage, parliamentary choice, even con|que&s;t,
are there enumerated; and to the whole the &s;anc|tion
of religion is added; excommunication is denounced
again&s;t every one who &s;hould either di&s;turb him in the
pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or the heirs of his body in their future
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown; and from this penalty, no cri|minal,
except in the article of death, can be ab&s;olved
but by the pope him&s;elf, or his &s;pecial commiffioners. It
is difficult to imagine, that the &s;ecurity derived from this
bull, could be a compen&s;ation for the defect which it be|trayed
in Henry's title, and for the danger of thus invit|ing
the pope to interpo&s;e in the&s;e concerns.</P>
<P>IT was natural, and even laudable in Henry to rever&s;e
the attainders, which had pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t the partizans of
<PB N="334" REF="354">
the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter: But the revenges, which $e
exerci&s;ed again&s;t the retainers of the York family, to
which he was &s;o &s;oon to be allied, cannot be con&s;dered
in the &s;ame light. Yet the parliament, at his in&s;tiga|tion,
pa&s;&s;ed an act of attainder again&s;t the late King
him&s;elf, again&s;t the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Surrey,
vi&s;count Lovel, the lords Zouche and Ferrars of Chart|ley,
Sir Walter and Sir James Harrington, Sir William
Berkeley, Sir Humphrey Stafford, Cate&s;by, and about
twenty other gentlemen, who had fought on Richard's
&s;ide in the battle of Bo&s;worth. How men could be guilty
of trea&s;on, by &s;upporting the King in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t
the earl of Richmond, who a&s;&s;umed not the title of
King, it was not ea&s;y to determine; and nothing but a
&s;ervile complai&s;ance in the parliament could have en|gaged
them to make this &s;tretch of ju&s;tice. Nor was it
a &s;mall mortification to the people in general, to find,
that the King, prompted either by avarice or re&s;ent|ment,
could, in the very beginning of his reign, &s;o far
violate the cordial union, which had been previou&s;ly
concerted between the parties, and to the expectation of
which he had plainly owed his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne.</P>
<P>THE King, having gained &s;o many points of con&s;e|quence
from his parliament, thought it not expedient to
demand any &s;upply from them, which the profound peace
enjoyed by the nation, and the late forfeitures of Rich|ard's
adherents, &s;eemed to render &s;o me what &s;uperfluous.
The parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of December.</NOTE> however, conferred on him during life
the duty of tonnage and poundage, which had been
enjoyed in the &s;ame manner by &s;ome of his immediate
predece&s;&s;ors; and they added, before they broke up,
other lucrative bills of no great moment. The King,
on his part, made &s;ome returns of grace and favour to
his people. He publi&s;hed his royal proclamation, offer|ing
<PB N="335" REF="355">
pardon to all &s;uch, as had taken arms, or formed any
attempts again&s;t him; provided they &s;ubmitted them|&s;elves
to mercy by a certain day, and took the u&s;ual oath
of fealty and allegiance. Upon this proclamation many
came out of their &s;anctuaries, and the minds of men
were every where much quieted. Henry cho&s;e to take
wholly to him&s;elf the merit of an act of grace, &s;o agree|able
to the nation; rather than communicate it with
the parliament, (as was his fir&s;t intention) by pa&s;&s;ing a
bill to that purpo&s;e. The earl of Surrey, however,
tho' he had &s;ubmitted, and delivered him&s;elf into the
King's hands, was &s;ent pri&s;oner to the Tower.</P>
<P>DURING this parliament, the King al&s;o be&s;towed fa|vours
and honours on &s;ome particular per&s;ons, who were
attached to him. Edward Stafford, elde&s;t &s;on to the
duke of Buckingham, forfeited in the late reign, was
re&s;tored to all the honours of his family, as well as to
all its fortune, which was very ample. This genero|&s;ity,
&s;o unu&s;ual in Henry, was the effect of his grati|tude
to the memory of Buckingham, who had fir&s;t con|certed
the plan of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, and who
by his own ruin had made way for that great event.
Chandos of Brittany was created earl of Bath, Sir Giles
Daubeny lord Daubeny, and Sir Robert Willoughby
lord Broke. The&s;e were all the titles of nobility con|ferred
by the King<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 566.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the mini&s;ters, whom the King mo&s;t tru&s;ted and
favoured, were not cho&s;en from among the nobility, or
even from among the laity. John Morton, and Richard
Fox, two clergymen, per&s;ons of indu&s;try, vigilance, and
capacity, were the men to whom he chiefly confided
his affairs and &s;ecret councils. They had &s;hared with
<PB N="336" REF="356">
him all his former dangers and di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and he now
took care to make them participate in his good fortune.
They were both called to the privy council; and Mor|ton
was created bi&s;hop of Ely, Fox of Exeter. The
former &s;oon after, upon the death of Bourchier, was
rai&s;ed to the &s;ee of Canterbury. The latter was made
lord privy &s;eal; and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, bi&s;hop of Bath and
Wells, Durham, and Winche&s;ter. For Henry, as lord
Bacon ob&s;erves, loved to employ and advance prelates,
becau&s;e, having rich bi&s;hoprics to be&s;tow, it was ea&s;y for
him to reward their &s;ervices: And it was his maxim to
rai&s;e them by &s;low &s;teps, and make them fir&s;t pa&s;s thro'
the inferior bi&s;hoprics<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 582.</NOTE>. He probably expected, that as
they were naturally more dependant on him than the no|bility,
who, during that age, enjoyed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and ju|ri&s;dictions
dangerous to royal authority; &s;o the pro&s;pect
of &s;ome farther elevation would render them &s;till more
active in his &s;ervice, and more ob&s;equious to his com|mands.</P>
<P>IN pre&s;enting the bill of tonnage and poundage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1486.</NOTE> the
parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th of Ja|nuary.</NOTE> anxious to pre&s;erve the true and undi&s;puted
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, had petitioned Henry, with de|mon&s;trations
of the greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, to e&s;pou&s;e the
prince&s;s Elizabeth; but they covered their real rea&s;on
under the dutiful pretence of their de&s;ire to have heirs of
his body. He now thought in earne&s;t of &s;ati&s;fying
the minds of his people in that particular.<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's marriage.</NOTE> His marriage
was celebrated at London; and that with greater appear|ance
of univer&s;al joy, than either his fir&s;t entry or his
coronation. Henry remarked with much di&s;plea&s;ure this
general favour which was borne the hou&s;e of York. The
&s;u&s;picions, which aro&s;e from it, not only di&s;turbed his
<PB N="337" REF="357">
tranquillity during his whole reign, but bred di&s;gu&s;t to|wards
his &s;pou&s;e her&s;elf, and poi&s;oned all his dome&s;tic
enjoyments. Tho' virtuous, amiable, and ob&s;equious
to the la&s;t degree, &s;he never met with a proper return of
affection, or even of complai&s;ance from her hu&s;band;
and the malignant ideas of faction &s;till, in his &s;ullen
mind, prevailed over all the &s;entiments of conjugal
tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE King had been carried along with &s;uch a tide
of &s;ucce&s;s ever &s;ince his arrival in England, that he
thought nothing could with&s;tand the fortune, and au|thority
which attended him. He now re&s;olved to make
a progre&s;s into the North, where the friends of the hou&s;e
of York, and even the partizans of Richard, were mo&s;t
numerous; in hopes of curing, by his pre&s;ence and con|ver&s;ation,
the prejudices of the malecontents. When he
arrived at Nottingham, he heard that vi&s;count Lovel,
with Sir Humphrey Stafford and Thomas, his brother,
had withdrawn them&s;elves &s;ecretly from their &s;anctuary
at Colche&s;ter: But this news appeared not to him of
&s;uch importance as to &s;top his journey; and he proceeded
forward to York.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An in&s;ur|rection.</NOTE> He there heard, that the Staffords
had levied an army in the county of Worce&s;ter, and
were approaching to be&s;iege that city: And that Lovel,
at the head of an army of three or four thou&s;and men,
was marching to attack him in York. Henry was not
di&s;mayed with this intelligence. His active courage,
full of re&s;ources, immediately prompted him to find the
proper remedy. Tho' he knew him&s;elf to be &s;urrounded
with enemies in the&s;e di&s;affected counties, he a&s;&s;embled
a &s;mall body of troops, in whom he could confide; and
he put them under the command of the duke of Bedford.
He joined to them all his own attendants; but he found
that this ha&s;ty armament was more formidable by their
<PB N="338" REF="358">
&s;pirit and their zealous attachment to him, than by
the arms or military &s;tores of which they were provided.
He therefore gave Bedford orders not to approach the
enemy; but previou&s;ly to try every proper expedient to
di&s;&s;ipate them. Bedford publi&s;hed a general promi&s;e of
pardon to the rebels, which had a greater effect on their
leader than on his followers. Lovel, who had under|taken
an enterprize, that exceeded his courage and ca|pacity,
was &s;o terrified with the fears of de&s;ertion among
his troops, that he &s;uddenly withdrew him&s;elf, and, after
lurking &s;ome time in Lanca&s;hire, he made his e&s;cape
into Flanders, where he was protected by the dutche&s;s
of Burgundy. His army &s;ubmitted to the King's cle|mency;
and the other rebels, hearing of this &s;ucce&s;s,
rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Worce&s;ter, and di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves.
The Staffords took fanctuary in the church of Colnham,
a village near Abingdon; but as it was found, that that
church had not the privilege of giving protection to re|bels,
they were taken thence: The elde&s;t Stafford was
executed at Tyburn; the younger, pleading that he
was mi&s;led by his brother, obtained a pardon<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 569.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY's joy for this &s;ucce&s;s was followed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th of September.</NOTE> &s;ome time
after, by the birth of a prince, to whom he gave the
name of Arthur, in memory of the famous Briti&s;h King
of that name, from whom, it was pretended, the family
of Tudor derived their de&s;cent.</P>
<P>THO' Henry had been able to di&s;&s;ipate that ha&s;ty re|bellion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;contents of the peo|ple.</NOTE>
which was rai&s;ed by the relicts of Richard's par|tizans,
his government was become in general very un|popular:
The &s;ource of the public di&s;content aro&s;e chiefly
from his prejudice again&s;t the hou&s;e of York, which was
univer&s;ally beloved by the nation, and which, for that
<PB N="339" REF="359">
very rea&s;on, became every day more the object of his
hatred and jealou&s;y. Not only a preference on all occa|&s;ions,
it was ob&s;erved, was given to the Lanca&s;trians;
but many of the oppo&s;ite party had been expo&s;ed to great
&s;overity, and had been bereaved of their fortunes by acts
of attainder. A general re&s;umption likewi&s;e had pa&s;&s;ed
of all grants made by the princes of the hou&s;e of York;
and tho' this rigour had been covered under the pretence,
that the revenue was become in&s;ufficient to &s;upport the
crown, and tho' the liberalities, granted during the latter
years of Henry the &s;ixth, were re&s;umed by the &s;ame
law, yet the York-party, as they were the principal &s;uf|ferers
by the re&s;umption, thought it chiefly levelled
again&s;t them. The &s;everity, exerci&s;ed again&s;t the earl
of Warwic, begot compa&s;&s;ion towards youth and inno|cence,
expo&s;ed to &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion; and his confinement
in the Tower, the very place where Edward's children
had been murdered by their uncle, made the public ex|pect
a like cata&s;trophe for him, and led them to make a
compari&s;on between Henry and that dete&s;ted tyrant.
And when it was remarked, that the Queen her&s;elf met
with har&s;h treatment, and even after the birth of a &s;on,
was not admitted to the honour of a public coronation,
Henry's prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were then concluded to be ab&s;o|lutely
incurable, and men became equally ob&s;tinate in
their di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t his government. Nor was the man|ner
and addre&s;s of the King calculated to cure the&s;e
prejudices contracted again&s;t his admini&s;tration; but had,
in every thing, a tendency to promote fear, or at be&s;t
reverence, rather than good-will and affection<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 583.</NOTE>. And
while the high, idea, entertained of his policy and vigour,
retained the nobility and men of character in obedience;
the effects of his unpopular government &s;oon appeared
<PB N="340" REF="360">
in the public, by incidents of a very extraordinary na|ture.</P>
<P>THERE lived in Oxford, one Richard Simon, a prie&s;t,
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;ubtlety, and &s;till more boldne&s;s and
temerity. This man had entertained the de&s;ign of
di&s;turbing Henry's government, by rai&s;ing up a pretender
to his crown; and for that purpo&s;e, he ca&s;t his eyes
on Lambert Simnel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert Simnel.</NOTE> a youth of fifteen years of age,
who was &s;on of a baker, and who, being endowed with
under&s;tanding above his years, and addre&s;s above his
condition, &s;eemed well fitted to per&s;onate a prince of
royal extraction. A report had been &s;pread among the
people, and received with great avidity, that Richard,
duke of York, &s;econd &s;on to Edward the fourth, had,
by a &s;ecret e&s;cape, &s;aved him&s;elf from his uncle's cruelty,
and lay &s;omewhere concealed in England. Simon, taking
advantage of this rumour, had at fir&s;t in&s;tructed his pu|pil
to a&s;&s;ume that name, which he found to be &s;o fondly
cheri&s;hed by the public: But hearing afterwards a new
report, that Warwic had made his e&s;cape from the
Tower, and ob&s;erving that this news was attended with
no le&s;s general &s;ati&s;faction, he changed the plan of his
impo&s;ture, and made Simnel per&s;onate that unfortunate
prince<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 569, 570.</NOTE>. Tho' the youth was qualified by nature for the
part which he was in&s;tructed to act; yet was it remarked,
that he was better informed in circum&s;tances relating to
the royal family, and particularly in the adventures of
the earl of Warwic, than he could be &s;uppo&s;ed to have
learned from one of Simon's condition: And it was
thence conjectured, that per&s;ons of higher rank, parti|zans
of the hou&s;e of York, had laid the plan of this con|&s;piracy,
and had conveyed proper in&s;tructions to the
actors. The Queen dowager her&s;elf was expo&s;ed to
<PB N="341" REF="361">
great &s;u&s;picion; and it was indeed the general opinion,
however unlikely it might &s;eem, that &s;he had &s;ecretly
given her con&s;ent to this impo&s;ture. This woman was
of a very re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition. That character of ambi|tion
and intrigue, which &s;he had betrayed during the
reign of her hu&s;band, had not abandoned her during
the u&s;urpation of Richard; and in her clo&s;et was fir&s;t
laid the plan of the great confederacy, which overturned
the throne of the tyrant, and rai&s;ed the earl of Rich|mond
to royal dignity. Finding, that, in&s;tead of re|ceiving
the reward of the&s;e &s;rvices, &s;he her&s;elf was
fallen into ab&s;olute in&s;ignificance, her daughter treated
with &s;everity, and all her friends brought under &s;ub|jection,
&s;he had conceived the mo&s;t violent animo&s;ity
again&s;t Henry, and had re&s;olved to make him feel the
effects of her re&s;entment. The impo&s;tor, &s;he knew,
however &s;ucce&s;sful, might ea&s;ily at la&s;t be &s;et a&s;ide; and
if a way could be found at his ri&s;que to &s;ubvert the King's
government, &s;he hoped that a &s;cene would be opened,
which, tho' difficult, at pre&s;ent exactly to fore&s;ee, would
gratify her revenge, and be on the whole le&s;s irk&s;ome
to her, than that &s;lavery and contempt, to which &s;he
was reduced<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 570.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT whatever care Simon might take to convey in|&s;truction
to his pupil, Simnel, he knew, that the im|po&s;ture
would not bear a clo&s;e in&s;pection; and he was
therefore determined to open the fir&s;t public &s;cene of it
in Ireland. That i&s;land, which was zealou&s;ly attached
to the hou&s;e of York, and bore an affectionate regard to
the memory of Clarence, Warwic's father, who had
been their lieutenant, was improvidently allowed by Hen|ry
to remain in the &s;ame condition, in which he found it;
and all the coun&s;ellors and officers, who had been ap|pointed
<PB N="342" REF="362">
by his predece&s;&s;or, &s;till retained their authority.
No &s;ooner did Simnel pre&s;ent him&s;elf to Thomas Fitz|gerald,
earl of Kildare, the deputy, and claim his pro|tection
as the unfortunate Warwic, than that credulous
nobleman, not &s;u&s;pecting &s;o bold a fiction, lent atten&s;ion
to him, and began to con&s;ult &s;ome per&s;ons of rank with
regard to this extraordinary incident. The&s;e he found
even more &s;anguine in their zeal and belief than him&s;elf:
And in proportion as the &s;tory diffu&s;ed it&s;elf among tho&s;e
of lower condition, it became the object of &s;till higher
pa&s;&s;ion and credulity; till the people in Dublin with
one con&s;ent tendered their allegiance to Simnel, as to
the true Plantagenet. Fond of a novelty, which flat|tered
their natural propen&s;ion, they overlooked the daugh|ters
of Edward the fourth, who &s;tood before Warwic in
of the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of Ireland.</NOTE> they payed the pretended prince
attendance as their &s;overeign, lodged him in the ca&s;tle
of Dublin, crowned him with a diadem taken from a &s;ta|tue
of the virgin, and publicly proclaimed him King,
under the appellation of Edward the &s;ixth. The whole
i&s;land followed the example of the capital; and not a
&s;word was any where drawn in Henry's quarrel.</P>
<P>WHEN this intelligence was conveyed to Henry, it
reduced him to &s;ome perplexity. Determined always to
face his enemies in per&s;on, he yet &s;crupled at pre&s;ent to
leave England, where he &s;u&s;pected the con&s;piracy was
fir&s;t framed, and where, he knew, many per&s;ons of con|dition,
and the people in general were much di&s;po&s;ed to
give it countenance. In order to di&s;cover the &s;ecret
&s;ource of the contrivance, and take mea&s;ures again&s;t
this open revolt, he held frequent con&s;ultations with his
mini&s;ters and coun&s;ellors, and laid plans for a vigorous
defence of his authority, and the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of his ene|mies.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="363">
THE fir&s;t event, which followed the&s;e deliberations,
gave great &s;urprize to the public: It was the &s;eizure of
the Queen, dowager, the forfeiture of all her lands and
revenue, and the clo&s;e confinement of her per&s;on in the
nunnery of Bermonde&s;ey. So arbitrary and violent an
act of authority was covered with a very thin pretence.
It was alleged, that, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ecret agree|ment
to marry her daughter to Henry, &s;he had yet yield|ed
to the &s;olicitations and menaces of Richard, and de|livered
that prince&s;s and her &s;i&s;ters into the hands of
the tyrant. This crime, which was now become ob|&s;olete,
and might admit of alleviations, was therefore
&s;u&s;pected not to be the real cau&s;e of the &s;everity, with
which &s;he was treated; and men believed, that the
King, unwilling to accu&s;e &s;o near a relation of a con|&s;piracy
again&s;t him, had cloaked his vengeance or pre|caution
under the pretext of an offence, known to the
whole world<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 583. Polydore Virgil, p. 571.</NOTE>. They were afterwards the more con|firmed
in this &s;u&s;picion, when they found, that the un|fortunate
Queen, tho' &s;he &s;urvived this di&s;grace &s;everal
years, was never treated with any more lenity, but was
allowed to end her life in poverty, &s;olitude, and con|finement.</P>
<P>THE next mea&s;ure of the King was of a le&s;s ex|ceptionable
nature. He ordered that Warwic &s;hould be
taken from the Tower, be led in proce&s;&s;ion through the
&s;treets of London, be conducted to St. Paul's, and there
expo&s;ed to the eyes of the whole people. He even gave
directions, that &s;ome per&s;ons of condition, who were
attached to the hou&s;e of York, and were be&s;t acquainted
with the per&s;on of this prince, &s;hould approach him
and conver&s;e with him: And he tru&s;ted, that the&s;e, being
convinced of the ab&s;urd impo&s;ture of Simnel, would
<PB N="344" REF="364">
put a &s;top to the credulity of the people. The expedient
had its effect in England: But in Ireland the people &s;till
per&s;i&s;ted in their revolt, and zealou&s;ly retorted on the
King the reproach of propagating an impo&s;ture, and of
having &s;hewn a counterfeit Warwic to the people.</P>
<P>HENRY had &s;oon rea&s;on to apprehend, that the de|&s;ign
again&s;t him was not laid on &s;uch $light foundations
as the ab&s;urdity of the contrivance &s;eemed to promi&s;e.
John earl of Lincoln, &s;on of John de la Pole, duke of
Suffolk, and of Elizabeth, elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter to Edward the
fourth, was engaged to take part in the con&s;piracy.
This nobleman, who po&s;&s;e&s;t capacity and courage, had
entertained very a&s;piring views; and his ambition was
encouraged by the known intentions of his uncle, Ri|chard,
who had formed a de&s;ign, in ca&s;e him&s;elf &s;hould
die without i&s;&s;ue, of declaring Lincoln &s;ucce&s;&s;or to
the crown. The King's jealou&s;y again&s;t all eminent
per&s;ons of the York-party, and his rigour towards War|wic,
had farther &s;truck Lincoln with apprehensions, and
made him re&s;olve to &s;eek for &s;afety in the mo&s;t dangerous
councils. Having fixed a &s;ecret correspondence with Sir
Thomas Broughton, a man of great intere&s;t in Lan|ca&s;hire,
he &s;et out for Flanders, where Lovel had arrived
a little before him; and he lived, during &s;ome time, in
the court of his aunt, the dutche&s;s of Burgundy, by

<P>MARGARET,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of the dutch$e&s;s of Burgundy.</NOTE> widow of Charles the Bold, duke of
Burgundy, having born no children to her hu&s;band, at|tached
her&s;elf with an entire friend&s;hip to her daughter-in-law,
married to Maximilian, archduke of Au&s;tria;
and after the death of that prince&s;s, &s;he per&s;evered in her
affection to Philip and Margaret, her children, and oc|cupied
her&s;elf in the care of their education and of their
per&s;ons. By her virtuous conduct and demeanor, &s;he
<PB N="345" REF="365">
had acquired great authority among the Flemings; and
lived with much dignity, as well as oeconomy, upon that
ample dowry, which &s;he inherited from her hu&s;band.
The re&s;entments of this prince&s;s were no le&s;s warm than
her friend&s;hips; and that &s;pirit of faction, which it is &s;o
difficult for a &s;ocial and &s;anguine temper to guard again&s;t,
had taken &s;trong po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart, and entrenched
&s;omewhat on the probity, which &s;hone forth in other
parts of her character. Hearing of the malignant jea|lou&s;y,
entertained by Henry again&s;t her family, and his
oppre&s;&s;ion of all its partizans; &s;he was moved with
the highe&s;t indignation, and &s;he determined to make
him repent of that enmity, of which &s;o many of her
friends, without any rea&s;on or nece&s;&s;ity, had fallen the
victims. After con&s;ulting with Lincoln and Lovel, &s;he
hired a body of two thou&s;and veteran Germans, under
the command of Martin Swart,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1487.</NOTE> a brave and experienced
officer<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 572, 573.</NOTE>; and &s;ent them over, together with the&s;e two
noblemen, to join Simnel in Ireland. The countenance,
given by per&s;ons of &s;uch high condition, and the ac|ce&s;&s;ion
of this military force, rai&s;ed extremely the courage
of the Iri&s;h, and made them entertain the re&s;olution of
invading England, where they believed the &s;pirit of di&s;|affection
to prevail as much as it had appeared to do in
Ireland.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lambert Simnel invades Eng|land.</NOTE>. The poverty al&s;o, under which they laboured,
made it impo&s;&s;ible for them to maintain any longer their
new court and army, and in&s;pired them with a &s;trong
de&s;ire of enriching them&s;elves by plunder and preferment
in England.</P>
<P>HENRY was not ignorant of the&s;e intentions of his
enemies; and he prepared him&s;elf for re&s;i&s;tance. He or|dered
troops to be mu&s;tered in different parts of the king|dom,
<PB N="346" REF="366">
and put them under the command or the $word$
Bedford, and the earl of Oxford. He con&s;in$ $word$
jealou&s;y the marquis of Dor&s;et, who, he futp$ $word$
would revenge the injuries &s;uffered by his mother, $word$
Queen dowager: And to gratify the people by an ap|pearance
of devotion, he made a pilgrimage to our lady
of Wal&s;ingham, famous for miracles; and there offered
up prayers for &s;ucce&s;e and for deliverance from his ene|mies.</P>
<P>BEING informed that Simnel and his forces were land|ed
at Foudrey in Lanca&s;hire, he drew together his own
troops, and advanced towards them as far as Coventry.
The rebels had entertained hopes, that the di&s;affected
counties in the North would ri&s;e in their favour: But
the people, aver&s;e to join Iri&s;h and German invaders,
convinced of Lambert's impo&s;ture, and kept in awe by
the King's reputation for &s;ucce&s;s and conduct, either
remained in tranquillity, or gave all a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the
royal army. The earl of Lincoln, therefore, who com|manded
the rebels, finding no hopes but in &s;peedy vic|tory,
was determined to bring the matter to a deci&s;ion;
and the King, &s;upported by the native courage of his
temper, and emboldened by a great acce&s;&s;ion of volunteers,
which had joined him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of June.</NOTE> under the earl of Shrew&s;bury
and lord Strange,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Stoke.</NOTE> declined not the combat. The op|po&s;ite
armies met at Stoke in the county of Notingham,
and fought a battle, which was more bloody and more
ob&s;tinately di&s;puted than could have been expected from
the inequality of their force. All the leaders of the re|bels
were re&s;olved to conquer or to die, and they in&s;pired
their troops with a like re&s;olution. The Germans al&s;o,
being veteran and experienced &s;oldiers, kept the victory
long doubtful; and even the Iri&s;h, tho' ill-armed and
almo&s;t defencele&s;s, &s;howed them&s;elves not defective in
&s;pirit and bravery. The King's victory was purcha&s;ed
<PB N="347" REF="367">
with lo&s;s, but was entirely deci&s;ive. Lincoln, Brough|ton
and Swart peri&s;hed in the field of battle, with four
thou&s;and of their troops. As Lovel was never more
heard of, he was believed to have undergone the &s;ame
fate. Simnel with his tutor, Simon, was taken pri|&s;oner.
Simon, being a prie&s;t, was not tried at law, and
was only committed to clo&s;e cu&s;tody: Simnel was too
contemptible either to excite apprehen&s;ion or re&s;entment
in Henry. He was pardoned, and made a &s;cullion in
the King's kitchen; whence he was afterwards advanced
to the rank of a falconer<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 586. Pol. Virg. P. 574.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY had now lei&s;ure to revenge him&s;elf of his
enemies. He made a progre&s;s into the northern parts,
where he gave many proofs of the rigours of his ju&s;tice.
A &s;trict enquiry was made after tho&s;e who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted or
favoured the rebels. The puni&s;hments were not all &s;an|guinary.
The King made his revenge &s;ub&s;ervient to his
avarice. Heavy fines were levied upon the delinquents.
In giving &s;entence, the proceedings of the courts, and
even the courts them&s;elves, were entirely arbitrary.
Either the criminals were tried by commi&s;&s;ioners ap|pointed
for that purpo&s;e, or they &s;uffered puni&s;hment
by &s;entence of a court-martial. And as a rumour had
prevailed before the battle of Stoke, that the rebels had
gained the victory, that the King's army was cut in
pieces, and that the King him&s;elf had e&s;caped by flight,
Henry was re&s;olved to interpret the belief or propaga|tion
of this report as a mark of di&s;affection; and he
puni&s;hed many for that pretended crime. But &s;uch, in
this age, was the &s;ituation of the Engli&s;h government,
that the royal prerogative, which was but imperfectly
re&s;trained during the mo&s;t peaceable periods, was &s;ure,
<PB N="348" REF="368">
in tumultuous, or even &s;u&s;picious times, which fre|quently
occurred, to break all bounds of law and or|der.</P>
<P>AFTER the King had &s;atisfied his rigour by the puni&s;h|ment
of his enemies, he re&s;olved to give contentment to
the people, in a point, which, tho' a mere ceremony,
was very pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired by them. The Queen had
been married near two years, but had not yet been
crowned; and this affectation of delay had given great
di&s;content to the public, and had been one principal
&s;ource of the di&s;affection which prevailed. The King,
in&s;tructed by experience,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th of No|vember.</NOTE> now finished the ceremony of
her coronation; and to &s;hew a &s;till more gracious di&s;|po&s;ition,
he gave liberty to her half-brother, the marquis
of Dor&s;et, who had been able to clear him&s;elf of all the
crimes of which he was accu&s;ed.</P>

Europe by the pro&s;perous and vigorous conduct

this time, invited him to look abroad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1488.</NOTE> and exert him|&s;elf
in behalf of his allies, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, in order
to give a ju&s;t account of his foreign mea&s;ures, to explain
the condition of the neighbouring kingdoms; beginning
with Scotland, which lies mo&s;t contiguous.</P>
<P>THE kingdom of Scotland had not as yet attained that<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Scotland.</NOTE>
&s;tate, which di&s;tingui&s;hes a civilized monarchy, and
Scotland, which enables the government, by the force of its laws
and in&s;titutions alone, without any extraordinary capa|city
in the &s;overeign, to maintain it&s;elf in order and
tranquillity. James the Third, who now filled the
<PB N="350" REF="370">
throne, was a prince of little indu&s;try and of a narrow
genius; and tho' it behoved him to yield the reins of
government to his mini&s;ters, he had never been able to
make any choice, which could give contentment both to
him&s;elf and to his people. When he be&s;towed his con|fidence
on any of the principal nobility, he found, that
they exalted their own family to &s;uch a height, as was
dangerous to the prince, and gave umbrage to the &s;tate:
When he conferred favour on any per&s;on of meaner
birth, on who&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion he could more depend, the
barons of his kingdom, enraged at the power of an up|&s;tart
minion, proceeded to the utmo&s;t extremities again&s;t
their &s;overeign. Had Henry entertained the ambition of
conque&s;ts, a tempting opportunity now offered of re|ducing
that kingdom to &s;ubjection; but as he was pro|bably
&s;en&s;ible, that a warlike people, tho' they might be
over-run by rea&s;on of their dome&s;tic divi&s;ions, could not
be retained in obedience without a regular military force,
which was then unknown in England, he rather pro|po&s;ed
the renewal of the peace with Scotland, and &s;ent
an emba&s;&s;y to James for that purpo&s;e. But the Scots,
who never de&s;ired a long peace with England, and who
thought that their &s;ecurity con&s;i&s;ted in pre&s;erving them|&s;elves
con&s;tantly in a warlike po&s;ture, would not agree
to more than a &s;even years truce, which was accordingly
concluded<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. p. 575.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE European &s;tates on the continent were then
ha&s;tening fa&s;t to that &s;ituation, in which they have re|mained,
without any material alterations, for near three
centuries; and began to unite them&s;elves into one ex|ten&s;ive
&s;y&s;tem of policy, which comprehended the chief
powers of Chri&s;tendom.<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Spain.</NOTE> Spain, which had hitherto
been almo&s;t entirely occupied within her&s;elf, now be|came
<PB N="351" REF="371" MS="Y">
formidable by the union of Arragon and Ca&s;tile, in
the per&s;ons of Ferdinand and I&s;abella, who, being princes
of great capacity, employed their force in enterprizes the
mo&s;t advantageous to their combined monarchy. The
conque&s;t of Granada from the Moors was then under|taken,
and brought near to a happy conclu&s;ion. And
in that expedition the military genius of Spain was re|vived;
honour and &s;ecurity were attained; and her
princes, no longer held in fear by a dome&s;tic enemy $o
dangerous, began to enter into all the tran&s;actions of
Europe, and make a great figure in every war and ne|gotiation.</P>
<P>MAXIMILIAN,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Low Countries.</NOTE> King of the Romans, &s;on to the em|peror
Frederic, had, by his marriage with the heire&s;s of
the hou&s;e of Burgundy, acquired an intere&s;t in the Low
Country provinces; and tho' the death of his &s;pou&s;e had
weakened his connection with that territory, he &s;till
pretended to the government as tutor to his &s;on Philip,
and his authority had been acknowledged by Brabant,
Holland, and &s;everal of the provinces. But as Flanders
and Hainault &s;till refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to his regency, and
even appointed other tutors to Philip, he had been en|gaged
in long wars again&s;t that ob&s;tinate people, and
never was able thoroughly to &s;ubdue their &s;pirit. That
he might free him&s;elf from the oppo&s;ition of France, he
had concluded a peace with Lewis the Eleventh, and
had given his daughter Margaret, then an infant, in
marriage to the Dauphin; together with Artois,
Franche-Compt&eacute;, and Charolois as her dowry. But this
alliance had not produced the de&s;ired effect:. The Dau|phin
&s;ucceeded to the crown of France under the appel|lation
of Charles the Eighth; but Maximilian &s;till found
the mutinies of the Flemings fomented by the intrigues
of the court of France.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="372">
FRANCE, during the two preceding reigns, had made
a mighty encrea&s;e in power and greatne&s;s; and had not
other &s;tates of Europe at the &s;ame time received an ac|ce&s;&s;ion
of force,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE> it had been impo&s;&s;ible to have retained
her within her antient boundaries. Mo&s;t of the great
fiefs, Normandy, Champagne, Anjou, Dauphiny, Gui|enne,
Provence, and Burgundy had been united to the
crown; the Engli&s;h had been expelled from all their
conqne&s;ts; the authority of the prince had been rai&s;ed
to &s;uch a condition as enabled him to maintain law and
order; a con&s;iderable military force was kept on foot,
and the finances were able to &s;upport them. Lewis the
Eleventh indeed, from whom many of the&s;e advantages
were derived, was dead, and had left his &s;on, in very
early youth and ill educated, to &s;u&s;tain the weight of the
monarchy: But having entru&s;ted the government to his
daughter, Anne, Lady of Beaujeu, a woman of &s;pirit and
capacity, the French power &s;uffered no check or decline.
On the contrary, this prince&s;s formed the great project,
which at la&s;t &s;he happily effected, of uniting to the crown
Britanny, the la&s;t and mo&s;t independent fief of the
monarchy.</P>
<P>FRANCIS the Second,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Britanny.</NOTE> duke of Britanny, was a good,
but a weak prince, who, con&s;cious of his own unfitne&s;s
for government, had re&s;igned him&s;elf entirely to the di|rection
of Peter Landais, a man of very mean birth,
more remarkable for his ability than for his virtue or in|tegrity.
The nobles of Britanny, di&s;plea&s;ed with the
great advancement of this favourite, had even proceeded
to di&s;affection again&s;t their &s;overeign; and after many
tumults and con&s;piracies, they at la&s;t united among
them&s;elves, and in a violent manner, &s;eized, tried, and
put to death the obnoxious mini&s;ter. Fearing the re&s;ent|ment
of the prince for this inva&s;ion of his authority,
<PB N="353" REF="373">
many of them retired to France; and others, for their
protection and &s;afety, maintained a corre&s;pondence with
that court. The French mini&s;try, ob&s;erving the great
di&s;&s;entions among the Bretons, thought the opportunity
favourable for invading that dutchy; and &s;o much the
rather as they could cover their ambition under the &s;pecious
pretence of providing for dome&s;tic &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>LEWIS, duke of Orleans, fir&s;t prince of the blood,
and pre&s;umptive heir of the monarchy, had di&s;puted the
admini&s;tration with the lady of Beaujeu; and tho' his
preten&s;ions had been rejected by the &s;tates, he &s;till main|tained
cabals with many of the grandees, and laid
&s;chemes for &s;ubverting the authority of that prince&s;s.
Finding his con&s;piracies detected, he took arms, and
fortified him&s;elf in Beaugenci; but as his revolt was
precipitate, before his confederates were ready to ri&s;e
with him, he had been obliged to &s;ubmit, and to receive
whatever conditions the French mini&s;try were plea&s;ed to
impo&s;e upon him. Actuated however by his ambition,
and even by $his fears, he &s;oon retired out of France,
and took &s;helter with the duke of Britanny, who was
de&s;irous of &s;trengthening him&s;elf again&s;t the de&s;igns
of the lady of Beaujeu by the friend&s;hip and credit of the
duke of Orleans. This prince al&s;o, ob&s;erving the
a&s;cendant which he &s;oon acquired over the duke of Bri|tanny,
had engaged many of his partizans to join him
at that court, and had formed the de&s;ign of aggrandizing
him&s;elf by a marriage with Anne, the heire&s;s of that
opulent dutchy.</P>
<P>THE barons of Britanny, who &s;aw all favour engro&s;&s;ed
by the duke of Orleans and his train, renewed a &s;tricter
corre&s;pondence with France, and even invited the French
King to make an inva&s;ion on their country. De&s;irous
<PB N="354" REF="374">
however to pre&s;erve its independancy, they had regu|lated
the number of &s;uccours, which France was to &s;end
them, and had &s;tipulated that no fortified place in Bri|tanny
&s;hould remain in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that monarchy.
A vain precaution, where revolted &s;ubjects treat with a
power &s;o much &s;uperior!<NOTE PLACE="marg">French in|va&s;ion of Britanny.</NOTE> The French invaded Britan|ny
with forces three times more numerous than tho&s;e
which they had promi&s;ed to the barons; and advancing
into the heart of the country, laid &s;iege to Ploermel.
To oppo&s;e them, the duke rai&s;ed a numerous, but ill-di&s;ciplined
army, which he put under the command of
the duke of Orleans, the count of Dunois, and others
of the French nobility. The army, di&s;contented with
this choice, and jealous of their confederates, &s;oon di&s;|banded,
and left their prince with too &s;mall a force to
keep the field again&s;t his invaders. He retired to
Vannes; but being hotly pur&s;ued by the French, who
had made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Ploermel, he e&s;caped
to Nantz; and the enemy, having taken and garri&s;oned
Vannes, Dinant, and other places, laid clo&s;e &s;iege to
that city. The barons of Britanny, finding their coun|try
menaced with total &s;ubjection, began gradually to
withdraw from the French army, and to make peace
with their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THIS de&s;ertion, however, of the Bretons di&s;couraged
not the court of France from pur&s;uing her favourite
project of reducing Britanny to &s;ubjection. The &s;itua|tion
of Europe appeared very favourable to the execution
of this de&s;ign. Maximilian was engaged in clo&s;e
alliance with the duke of Britanny, and had even open|ed
a treaty for marrying his daughter; but he was on all
occa&s;ions &s;o nece&s;&s;itous of money, and at that time &s;o
di&s;quicted by the mutinies of the Flemings, that little
<PB N="355" REF="375">
effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance could be expected from him. Fer|dinand
was entirely occupied in the conque&s;t of Granada;
and it was al&s;o known, that if France re&s;igned to him
Rou&s;illon and Cerdagne, to which he had preten&s;ions,
&s;he could at any time engage him to abandon the inte|re&s;ts
of Britanny. England alone was both enabled by
her power, and engaged by her intere&s;ts, to &s;upport the
independency of that dutchy; and the mo&s;t dangerous
oppo&s;ition was therefore, by the French, expected from
that quarter. In order to cover their real de&s;igns, no
&s;ooner were they informed of Henry's &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t
Simnel and his partizans, than they di&s;patched amba&s;|&s;adors
to the court of London, and made profe&s;&s;ions of
the utmo&s;t tru&s;t and confidence in that monarch.</P>
<P>THE amba&s;&s;adors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">French em|ba&s;&s;y to England.</NOTE> after congratulating Henry on the
late victory, and communicating to him in the mo&s;t cor|dial
manner, as to an intimate friend, &s;ome &s;ucce&s;&s;es of
their ma&s;ter again&s;t Maximilian, came in the progre&s;s of
their di&s;cour&s;e to mention the late tran&s;actions in Bri|tanny.
They told him that the duke of Britanny hav|ing
given protection to French &s;ugitives and rebels, the
King had been nece&s;&s;itated, contrary to his intention and
inclination, to carry war into that dutchy: That the ho|nour
of the crown was intere&s;ted not to &s;uffer a va&s;&s;al &s;o
far to forget his duty to his liege lord; nor was the &s;e|curity
of the government of France le&s;s concerned to
prevent the con&s;equences of this dangerous temerity:
That the fugitives were no mean nor ob&s;cure per&s;ons;
but, among others, the duke of Orleans, fir&s;t prince of
the blood, who, finding him&s;elf obnoxious to ju&s;tice for
trea&s;onable practices in France, had fled into Britanny;
where he &s;till per&s;evered in laying &s;chemes of rebellion
again&s;t his &s;overeign: That the war being thus, on the
<PB N="356" REF="376">
part of the French monarch, entirely defen&s;ive, it would
immediately cea&s;e, when the duke of Britanny, by re|turning
to his duty, &s;hould remove the cau&s;es of it:
That their ma&s;ter was &s;en&s;ible of the obligations which
that duke, in very critical times, had conferred on
Henry; but it was known al&s;o, that in times &s;till more
critical, he or his mercenary coun&s;ellors had de&s;erted
him, and put his life in the utmo&s;t hazard: That his
&s;ole refuge in &s;uch de&s;perate extremities had been the
court of France, which not only protected his per&s;on,
but &s;upplied him with men and money, with which,
aided by his own valour and conduct, he had been en|abled
to mount the throne of England: That France,
in this tran&s;action, had, from friend&s;hip to Henry, acted
contrary to what, in a narrow view, might be e&s;teemed
her own intere&s;t; &s;ince, in&s;tead of an odious tyrant, &s;he
had contributed to e&s;tabli&s;h on a rival throne a prince
endowed with &s;uch virtue and ability: And that as both
the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e and the obligations conferred on
Henry thus preponderated on the &s;ide of France, their
ma&s;ter expected, that, if the &s;ituation of Henry's affairs
allowed him not to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance to that kingdom, he
would at lea&s;t pre&s;erve a neutrality between the contend|ing
parties<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 589.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;cour&s;e of the French amba&s;&s;adors was plau|&s;ible;
and to give it greater weight, they communicated
to Henry, as in confidence, their ma&s;ter's intention,
after he &s;hould have compo&s;ed the differences with Bri|tanny,
to lead an army into Italy, and make good his
preten&s;ions to the kingdom of Naples: A project, which,
they knew, would give no umbrage to the court of Eng|land.
<PB N="357" REF="377">
But all the&s;e artifices were in vain employed
again&s;t the penetration of the King. He clearly &s;aw,
that France had entertained the view of &s;ubduing Bri|tanny;
but he al&s;o perceived, that &s;he would meet with
great, and, as he thought, in&s;uperable difficulties in the
execution of her project. The native force of that dut|chy,
he knew, had always been con&s;iderable, and had
often, without any foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance, re&s;i&s;ted the power
of France; the natural temper of the French nation,
he imagined, would make them ea&s;ily abandon every
enterprize, which required per&s;everance; and as the
heir of the crown was confederated with the duke of
Britanny, the courtiers would be &s;till more remi&s;s in pro|&s;ecuting
a &s;cheme which mu&s;t draw on them his re&s;ent|ment
and di&s;plea&s;ure. Should even the&s;e internal ob|&s;tructions
be removed, Maximilian, who&s;e enmity to
France was well known, and who now paid his addre&s;&s;es
to the heire&s;s of Britanny, would be able to make a di|ver&s;ion
on the &s;ide of Flanders; nor could it be expected
that France, if &s;he pro&s;ecuted &s;uch ambitious projects,
would be allowed to remain in tranquillity by Fer|dinand
and I&s;abella. Above all, he thought, the French
court could never expect, that England, &s;o deeply in|tere&s;ted
to pre&s;erve the independancy of Britanny, &s;o
able by her power and &s;ituation to give effectual and
prompt a&s;&s;i&s;tance, would permit &s;uch an acce&s;&s;ion of
force to her rival. He imagined, therefore, that the mi|ni&s;ters
of France, convinced of the impracticability of
their &s;chemes, would at la&s;t embrace pacific views, and
would abandon an enterprize, &s;o obnoxious to all the
potentates of Europe.</P>
<P>THIS rea&s;oning of Henry was &s;olid, and might very
ju&s;tly engage him in dilatory and cautious mea&s;ures:
<PB N="358" REF="378">
But there entered into his conduct another motive, which
was apt to draw him beyond the ju&s;t bounds, becau&s;e
founded on a ruling pa&s;&s;ion. His frugality, which by
degrees degenerated into avarice, made him aver&s;e to all
warlike enterprizes and di&s;tant expeditions; and engaged
him previou&s;ly to try the expedient of negotiation. He
di&s;patched Ur&s;wic, his almoner, a man of addre&s;s and
ability, to make offer of his mediation to the contending
parties: An offer, which, he thought, if accepted by
France, would &s;oon lead to a compo&s;ure of all diffe|rences;
if refu&s;ed or eluded, would at lea&s;t di&s;cover the
per&s;everance of that court in their ambitious projects.
Ur&s;wic found the lady of Beaujeu, now dutche&s;s of
Bourbon, engaged in the &s;iege of Nantz, and had the
&s;atisfaction to find that his ma&s;ter's mediation was very
readily embraced, and with many expre&s;&s;ions of confi|dence
and moderation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;&s;imula|tion of the French court.</NOTE> That able prince&s;s concluded,
that the duke of Orleans, who governed the court of Bri|tanny,
fore&s;eeing that every accommodation mu&s;t be
made at his expence, would u&s;e all his intere&s;t to have
Henry's propo&s;al rejected; and would by that means
make an effectual apology for the French mea&s;ures, and
draw on the Bretons the reproach of ob&s;tinacy and in|ju&s;tice.
The event ju&s;tified her prudence. When the
Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador made the &s;ame applications to the
duke of Britanny, he received for an&s;wer, in the name
of that prince, that having &s;o long acted the part of pro|tector
and guardian to Henry, during his youth and ad|ver&s;ity,
he had expected, from a monarch of &s;uch virtue,
more effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in his pre&s;ent di&s;treffes, than
a barren offer of mediation, which &s;u&s;pended not the
progre&s;s of the French arms: That if Henry's gratitude
was not &s;ufficient to engage him in &s;uch a mea&s;ure, his
prudence, as King of England, &s;hould di&s;cover to him
<PB N="359" REF="379">
the pernicious con&s;equences attending the conque&s;t of
Brittany, and its annexation to the crown of France:
That that kingdom, already become too powerful, would
be enabled, by &s;o great an acce&s;&s;ion of force, to di&s;play,
to the ruin of England, that ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition, which
had always &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between tho&s;e rival nations: That
Brittany, &s;o u&s;eful an ally, which, by its &s;ituation, gave
the Engli&s;h an entrance into the heart of France; being
annexed to that kingdom, would be equally enabled from
its &s;ituation to di&s;turb, either by pyracies or naval arma|ments,
the commerce and peace of England: And that
if the duke refu&s;ed Henry's mediation, it proceeded nei|ther
from an inclination to a war, which he experienced
to be &s;o ruinous to him, nor from a confidence in his
own force, which he knew to be &s;o much inferior to that
of the enemy; but merely from a &s;en&s;e of his pre&s;ent ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
which mu&s;t engage the King to act the part of
his confederate, not of a mediator.</P>
<P>WHEN this an&s;wer was reported to the King, he
abandoned not the &s;y&s;tem of conduct which he had
formed: He only concluded, that &s;ome more time was
requi&s;ite to quell the ob&s;tinacy of the Bretons and make
them &s;ubmit to rea&s;on. And when he learned, that the
people of Brittany, anxious for their duke's &s;afety, had
formed a tumultuary army of 60,000 men, and had ob|liged
the French to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Nantz, he fortified
him&s;elf the more in his opinion, that the court of France
would at la&s;t be reduced, by multiplied ob&s;tacles and dif|ficulties,
to abandon the project of reducing Brittany to
&s;ubjection. He continued therefore the &s;cheme of ne|gotiation,
and thereby expo&s;ed him&s;elf to be deceived by
the artifices of the French mini&s;try; who, &s;till pretend|ing
pacific intentions, &s;ent lord Bernard Daubigni, a
Scots man of quality, to London, and pre&s;&s;ed Henry not
<PB N="360" REF="380">
to be di&s;couraged in offering his mediation to the court
of Brittany. The King on his part di&s;patched another
emba&s;&s;y compo&s;ed of Ur&s;wic, the abbot of Abingdon,
and Sir Richard Ton&s;tal, who carried new propo&s;als for
an amicable accommodation. No effectual &s;uccours,
meanwhile, were provided for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Bretons.
The lord Woodville, brother to the Queen dowager, a
man of courage and enterprize, having a&s;ked leave to
rai&s;e underhand a body of volunteers and tran&s;port them
into Brittany, met with a refu&s;al from the King, who
was de&s;irous of pre&s;erving the appearance of a &s;trict neu|trality.
That nobleman, however, &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his
intentions. He went over to the I&s;le of Wight, of
which he was governor; levied a body of 400 men;
and having at la&s;t obtained, as is &s;uppo&s;ed, the &s;ecret per|mi&s;&s;ion
of Henry, &s;ailed with them to Brittany. This
enterprize proved fatal to the leader, and brought &s;mall
relief to the unhappy duke. The Bretons ra&s;hly en|gaged
in a general action with the French at St. Aubin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th July.</NOTE>
and were totally di&s;comfited. Woodville and all the
Engli&s;h were put to the &s;word; together with a body of
Bretons, who had been accoutered in the garb of Eng|li&s;hmen,
in order to &s;trike a greater terror into the
French, to whom the martial prowe&s;s of that nation was
always formidable<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Argentr&eacute; Hi&s;t. de Bretagne, liv. xii.</NOTE>. The duke of Orleans, the prince
of Orange, and many other per&s;ons of rank were taken
pri&s;oners: And the military force of Brittany was to|tally
di&s;&s;ipated. The death of the duke, which followed
&s;oon after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th Sep|tember.</NOTE> threw affairs into &s;till greater confu&s;ion, and
&s;eemed to threaten the &s;tate with a final &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>THO' the King prepared not again&s;t the&s;e events, &s;o
hurtful to the intere&s;t of England, with &s;ufficient vigour
<PB N="361" REF="381">
and precaution, he had not altogether overlooked them.
Determined to maintain a pacific conduct, as far as the
&s;ituation of affairs would permit, he yet knew the war|like
di&s;po&s;ition of his &s;ubjects, and ob&s;erved, that their
antient and inveterate animo&s;ity to France was now re|vived
by the pro&s;pect of this great acce&s;&s;ion to its power
and grandeur. He re&s;olved therefore to make advantage
of tho&s;e humours, and to draw &s;ome &s;upplies of money
from the people, on pretence of giving a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the
duke of Brittany. He had &s;ummoned a parliament to
meet at We&s;tmin&s;ter<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">9th November, 1487.</NOTE>; and he &s;oon per&s;uaded them to
grant him a con&s;iderable &s;ub&s;idy<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 579, &s;ays that this impo&s;ition was a capita|tion tax; the other hi&s;torians &s;ay it was a tax of two &s;hillings on the pound.</NOTE>. But this &s;upply, tho'
voted by parliament, involved the King in unexpected
difficulties. The counties of Durham and York, al|ways
di&s;contented with Henry's government, and farther
provoked by the late oppre&s;&s;ions, under which they had
laboured, after the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of Simnel's rebellion, re|&s;i&s;ted
the commi&s;&s;ioners who were appointed to levy the
new tax.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An in&s;ur|rection in the north.</NOTE> The commi&s;&s;ioners, terrified with this ap|pearance
of &s;edition, made application to the earl of
Northumberland, and de&s;ired of him advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance
in the execution of their office. That nobleman thought
the matter of importance enough to con&s;ult the King;
who, unwilling to yield to the humours of a di&s;contented
populace, and fore&s;eeing the pernicious con&s;equences
of &s;uch a precedent, renewed his orders for a &s;trict levy
of the impo&s;ition. Northumberland &s;ummoned toge|ther
the ju&s;tices and chief freeholders, and delivered the
King's commands in the mo&s;t imperious terms, which,
he thought, would inforce obedience, but which tended
only to provoke the people, and make them believe him
<PB N="362" REF="382">
the advi&s;er of tho&s;e orders which he delivered to them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 595.</NOTE>.
They flew to arms, and attacked Northumberland's
hou&s;e, whom they put to death. Having incurred &s;uch
deep guilt, their mutinous humour prompted them to de|clare
again&s;t the King him&s;elf; and being in&s;tigated by
one John Achamber, a &s;editious fellow of mean birth, they
cho&s;e Sir John Egremond their leader, and prepared
them&s;elves for a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance. Henry was not
di&s;mayed with an in&s;urrection &s;o precipitant and ill &s;up|ported.
He immediately levied a force which he put un|der
the command of the earl of Surrey, whom he had
delivered from confinement, and re&s;tored to his favour.
His intention was to &s;end down the&s;e troops, in order
to check the progre&s;s of the rebels; while he him&s;elf
&s;hould follow with a greater body, which would ab&s;o|lutely
in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s. But Surrey thought him&s;elf &s;trong
enough to encounter a raw and unarmed multitude; and
he &s;ucceeded in the attempt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suppre&s;&s;ed.</NOTE> The rebels were di&s;&s;ipated;
John Achamber taken pri&s;oner, and afterwards executed
with &s;ome of his accomplices; Sir John Egremond fled
to the dutche&s;s of Burgundy, who gave him protection;
the greater number of the rebels received a pardon.</P>
<P>HENRY had probably expected, when he obtained this
grant from the parliament, that he &s;hould be able to
terminate the affair of Brittany by negotiation, and that
he might thereby fill his coffers with the money levied
by the impo&s;ition. But as the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Bretons
&s;till multiplied, and became every day more urgent; he
found him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of taking &s;ome mea|&s;ures,
in order to &s;upport them. On the death of the
duke, the French had revived &s;ome antiquated claims to
the dominion of the dutchy; and as the duke of Orleans
was now captive in France, their former pretence for
<PB N="363" REF="383">
ho&s;tilities could no longer &s;erve as a cover to their am|bition.
The King re&s;olved therefore to engage as auxi|liary
to Brittany; and to con&s;ult the intere&s;t, as well as
de&s;ires of the people, by oppo&s;ing him&s;elf to the progre&s;s
of the French power. Be&s;ides entering into a league
with Maximilian, and another with Ferdinand, which
were di&s;tant re&s;ources, he levied a body of troops, to the
number of 6000 men, with an intention of tran&s;porting
them into Brittany.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1489.</NOTE> Still anxious, however, for the
payment of his expences, he concluded a treaty with the
young dutche&s;s, by which &s;he engaged to deliver into
his hands two &s;ea-port towns, there to remain till &s;he
&s;hould entirely refund the charges of the armament<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Du Tilltet, Recueil des Traitez.</NOTE>.
Tho' he engaged for the &s;ervice of the&s;e troops during
the &s;pace of eight months only, yet was the dutche&s;s ob|liged,
by the nece&s;&s;ity of her affairs, to &s;ubmit to &s;uch
rigid conditions, impo&s;ed by an ally, &s;o much concerned
in intere&s;t to protect her.<NOTE PLACE="marg">King &s;ends forces into Brittany.</NOTE> The forces arrived under the
command of lord Willoughby of Broke; and made the
Bretons, during &s;ome time, ma&s;ters of the field. The
French retired into their garri&s;ons; and propo&s;ed by di|latory mea&s;ures to wa&s;te the fire of the Engli&s;h, and di&s;|gu&s;t them with their enterprize. The &s;cheme was well
laid, and met with &s;ucce&s;s. Lord Broke found &s;uch di&s;|cord
and confu&s;ion in the councils of Brittany, that no
mea&s;ures could be concerted for any undertaking; no
&s;upply obtained; no provi&s;ions, carriages, artillery, or
military &s;tores procured. The whole court was rent
into factions: No one mini&s;ter had acquired the a&s;cend|ant:
And whatever project was formed by one, was
&s;ure to be traver&s;ed by another. The Engli&s;h, di&s;con|certed
in every enterprize, by the&s;e animo&s;ities and un|certain
councils, returned home as &s;oon as the time of
<PB N="364" REF="384">
their &s;ervice was elap&s;ed; leaving only a &s;mall garri&s;on
in tho&s;e towns which had been put into their hands.
During their &s;tay in Brittany, they had only contri|buted
&s;till farther to wa&s;te the country; and by their de|parture,
they left it entirely at the mercy of the enemy.
So feeble was the &s;uccour, which Henry in this impor|tant
conjuncture afforded his ally, whom the inva&s;ion of
a foreign enemy, concurring with domestic di&s;&s;en&s;ions,
had reduced to the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s!</P>
<P>THE great object of di&s;&s;en&s;ion among the Bretons was
the di&s;po&s;al of the young dutche&s;s in marriage. The
mare&s;chal Rieux &s;econded the &s;uit of the lord Albert,
who led &s;ome forces to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The chancellor
Montauban, ob&s;erving the aver&s;ion of the dutche&s;s to
this &s;uitor, in&s;i&s;ted, that a petty prince, &s;uch as Albert,
was unable to &s;upport Anne in her pre&s;ent extremities;
and he recommended &s;ome more powerful alliance, par|ticularly
that of Maximilian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1490.</NOTE> King of the Romans.
This party at la&s;t prevailed; the marriage with Maxi|milian
was celebrated by proxy; and the dutche&s;s thence|forth
a&s;&s;umed the title of Queen of the Romans. But
this magnificent appellation was all &s;he gained by her
marriage. Maximilian, de&s;titute of troops and money,
and embarra&s;&s;ed with the continual revolts of the Flem|ings,
could give no a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed con&s;ort:
While Albert, enraged at the preference given his rival,
de&s;erted her cau&s;e, and received the French into Nantz,
the mo&s;t important place in the dutchy, both for &s;trength
and riches.</P>
<P>THE French court began now to change their &s;cheme
with regard to the &s;ubjection of Brittany. Charles had
formerly been a&s;&s;ianced, to Margaret daughter of Maxi|milian;
who, tho too young to con&s;ummate her mar|riage,
had been &s;ent to Paris to be educated, and at this
<PB N="365" REF="385">
time bore the title of Queen of France. Be&s;ides the rich
dowry, which &s;he brought the King, &s;he was, after her
brother, Philip, then in early youth, heire&s;s to all the
dominions of the hou&s;e of Burgundy; and &s;eemed in
many re&s;pects the mo&s;t proper match, which could be
cho&s;en for the young monarch. The&s;e circum&s;tances
had &s;o blinded the councils both of Maximilian and
Henry, that they never &s;u&s;pected any other intentions
in the French court; nor were able to di&s;cover, that
engagements, &s;eemingly &s;o advantageous and &s;o &s;olemnly
entered into, could be infringed and &s;et a&s;ide. But
Charles began to perceive, that the conque&s;t of Brittany,
in oppo&s;ition to the natives, and to all the great powers
in Chri&s;tendom, would prove a very difficult enterprize;
and that even, if he &s;hould over-run the country and
make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the fortre&s;&s;es, it would be im|po&s;&s;ible
for him long to retain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them. The
marriage alone of the dutche&s;s could fully re-annex
that fief to the crown; and the pre&s;ent and certain enjoyment
of &s;o con&s;iderable a territory &s;eemed preferable to the pro|&s;pect
of inheriting the dominions of the hou&s;e of Bur|gundy;
a pro&s;pect which became every day more di&s;tant
and precarious. Above all, the marriage of Maximilian
and Anne, appeared de&s;tructive to the grandeur and even
&s;ecurity of the French monarchy; while that prince,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Flanders on the one hand, and Brittany on the
other, might thus from both quarters make inroads into
the heart of the country. The only remedy for the&s;e evils
was therefore concluded to be the di&s;&s;olution of the two
marriages, which had been celebrated, but not con&s;um|mated;
and the e&s;pou&s;al of the dutche&s;s of Brittany by
the King of France.</P>
<P>IT was requi&s;ite that this expedient, which had not
been fore&s;een by any court of Europe, and which they
<PB N="366" REF="386">
were, all of them, &s;o much engaged in point of intere&s;t
to oppo&s;e, &s;hould be kept a profound &s;ecret, and &s;hould
be di&s;covered to the world only by the full execu|tion
of it. The mea&s;ures of the French mini&s;try were in the
conduct of this delicate enterprize very wi&s;e and political.
While they pre&s;&s;ed Brittany with all the rigours of war,
they &s;ecretly gained the count of Dunois, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
great authority with the Bretons; and having al&s;o en|gaged
in their intere&s;ts the prince of Orange, cou&s;in|german
to the dutche&s;s, they gave him his liberty, and
&s;ent him into Brittany. The&s;e per&s;ons, &s;upported by other
emi&s;&s;aries of France, prepared the minds of men
for the great revolution projected, and di&s;played, tho'
&s;till with many precautions, all the advantages of an
union with the French monarchy. They repre&s;ented to
the barons of Brittany, that their country, harra&s;&s;ed
during &s;o many years with perpetual war, had need of
&s;ome repo&s;e, and of a &s;olid and la&s;tding peace with the
only power that was formidable to them: That their
alliance with Maximilian was not able to afford them
even pre&s;ent protection; and by uniting them clo&s;ely
with a power, which was rival to the greatne&s;s of France,
fixed the in perpetual enmity with that powerful mo|narchy:
That their near neighbourhood expo&s;ed them
fir&s;t to the inroads of the enemy; and the happie&s;t event,
which in &s;uch a &s;ituation could befal them, would be to
attain to peace, tho' by a final &s;ubjection to France, and
by the lo&s;s of that liberty, transmitted to them from their
ance&s;tors: And that any other expedients, compatible
with the honour of the &s;tate, and their duty to their &s;o|vereign,
was preferable to a &s;cene of &s;uch di&s;order and
deva&s;tation.</P>
<P>THESE &s;ugge&s;tions had influence on the Bretons: But
the chief difficulty lay in &s;urmounting the prejudices of
the young dutche&s;s her&s;elf. That prince&s;s had imbibed a
<PB N="367" REF="387">
&s;trong prejudice again&s;t the French nation, and particu|larly
again&s;t Charles, who had been the author of all the
calamities, which, from her earlie&s;t infancy, had beffallen
her family. She had al&s;o fixed her affections on Maxi|milian;
and as &s;he now deemed him her hu&s;band, &s;he
could not, &s;he thought, without incurring the greate&s;t
guilt, and violating the mo&s;t &s;olemn engagements, con|tract
a marriage with another per&s;on. In order to over|come
her ob&s;tinacy, Charles gave the duke of Orelans
his liberty, who, tho' formerly a &s;uitor to the dutche&s;s,
was now contented to ingratiate him&s;elf with the King,
by employing in his favour all the intere&s;t which he &s;till
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Britanny. The mare&s;chal Rieux and chan|cellor
Montauban were reconciled by his negotiations;
and the&s;e rival mini&s;ters now concurred with the prince
of Orange, and the count of Dunois, in pre&s;&s;ing the
conclu&s;ion of a marriage with Charles. By their &s;ug|ge&s;tion,
Charles advanced with a powerful army and in|ve&s;ted
Rennes, at that time the re&s;idence of the dutche&s;s;
who, a&s;&s;ailed on all hands, and finding none to &s;upport
her in her inflexibility, at la&s;t opened the gates of the
city, and agreed to e&s;pou&s;e the King of France. She
was married at Langey in Touraine;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annex|tion of Brittany to France.</NOTE> conducted to St.
Denis, where &s;he was crowned; and thence made her
entry into Paris, amid&s;t the joyful acclamations of the
people, who regarded this marriage as the mo&s;t pro&s;per|ous
event that could have befallen their monarchy.</P>
<P>THE triumph and &s;ucce&s;s of Charles was the mo&s;t
&s;en&s;ible mortification to the King of the Romans. He
had lo&s;t a con&s;iderable territory, which he thought he had
acquired, and an accompli&s;hed prince&s;s whom he had
e&s;pou&s;ed; he was affronted in the per&s;on of his daughter
margaret, who was &s;ent back to him, after &s;he had been
treated during &s;ome years as Queen of France; he had

rea&s;on to reproach him&s;elf with his own &s;upine &s;ecurity,
in neglecting the con&s;ummation of his marriage, which
was ea&s;ily practicable for him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1491.</NOTE> and which would have
rendered the tye indi&s;&s;oluble: The&s;e con&s;iderations threw
him into the mo&s;t violent rage, which he vented in very
indecent expre&s;&s;ions; and he threatened France with an
inva&s;ion from the united arms of Au&s;tria, Spain and
England.</P>
<P>THE King of England had al&s;o ju&s;t rea&s;on to reproach
him&s;elf with mi&s;conduct in this important tran&s;action;
and tho' the affair had terminated in a manner which he
could not preci&s;ely fore&s;ee, his negligence, in leaving his
mo&s;t u&s;eful ally &s;o long expo&s;ed to the inva&s;ion of &s;u|perior
power, could not but appear on reflection the re|&s;ult
of timid caution and narrow politics. As he va|lued
him&s;elf very much on his exten&s;ive forefight and
profound judgment, the a&s;cendant acquired over him, by
a raw youth, &s;uch as Charles, could not but give him
the highe&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure, and prompt him to &s;eek vengeance,
after all remedy for his mi&s;carriage was become ab&s;olutely
impracticable. But he was farther actuated by avarice,
a motive &s;till more predominant with him than either
pride or revenge; and he &s;ought even from his pre&s;ent
di&s;appointments, the gratification of this ruling pa&s;&s;ion.
On pretence of a French war, he i&s;&s;ued a commi&s;&s;ion for
levying a <HI>Benevolence</HI> on his people<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xii. p. 446. Bacon &s;ays that the benevolence was levied with con&s;ent of parliament, which is a mi&s;take.</NOTE>; an arbitrary tax|ation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th July.</NOTE>
which had been aboli&s;hed by a recent law of
Richard the third, and which was the more provoking,
becau&s;e, tho' really rai&s;ed by menaces and extortion, it
was neverthele&s;s pretended to be given by the voluntary
con&s;ent of the people. This violence fell chiefly on the
commercial part of the nation, who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
<PB N="369" REF="391">
the ready money. London alone contributed to the
amount of near 10,000 pounds. Archbi&s;hop Morton,
the chancellor, in&s;tructed the commi&s;&s;ioners to employ a
dilemma, in which every one might be comprehended:
If the per&s;ons applied to live frugally, they were told,
that their par&s;imony mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have enriched them:
If their method of living was &s;plendid and ho&s;pitable,
they were concluded opulent on account of their ex|pences.
This device was by &s;ome called chancellor
Morton's fork, and by others his crutch.</P>
<P>SO little apprehen&s;ive was the King of a parliament,
on account of his levying this arbitrary impo&s;ition, that
he &s;oon after &s;ummoned that a&s;&s;embly to meet at We&s;t|min&s;ter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">27th Octo|ber.</NOTE>
and he even expected to enrich him&s;elf farther
by working on their pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices. He knew
the re&s;entment, which the Engli&s;h had conceived again&s;t
France, on account of the conque&s;t of Brittany; and
he took care to in&s;i&s;t on that topic,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A parlia|ment.</NOTE> in the &s;peech, which
he him&s;elf pronounced to the parliament. He told them,
that France, elevated with her late &s;ucce&s;&s;es, had even
proceeded to a contempt of England, and had refu&s;ed to
pay the tribute, which Lewis the eleventh had &s;tipulated
to Edward the fourth: That it become &s;o warlike a na|tion
as the Engli&s;h to be rouzed by this indignity, and
not to limit their preten&s;ions merely to repre&s;&s;ing the
pre&s;ent injury: That for his part, he was determined to
lay claim to the crown of France it&s;elf, and to maintain
by force of arms &s;o ju&s;t a title tran&s;mitted to him by his
gallant ance&s;tors: That Crecy, Poictiers, and Azincourt
were &s;ufficient to in&s;truct them in their &s;uperiority over
the enemy; nor did he de&s;pair of adding new names to
the glorious catalogue: That a King of France had
been pri&s;oner at London, and a King of England had
been crowned at Paris; events which &s;hould animate
<PB N="370" REF="392">
them to an emulation of like glory with that enjoyed by
their forefathers: That the dome&s;tic di&s;&s;en&s;ions of Eng|land
had been the &s;ole cau&s;e of her lo&s;ing the&s;e foreign
dominions; and her pre&s;ent union and harmony would
be the effectual means of recovering them: That where
&s;uch la&s;ting honour was in view, and &s;uch an important
acqui&s;ition, it became not brave men to repine at the
advance of a little trea&s;ure: And that for his part, he
was determined to make the war maintain it&s;elf, and
hoped, by the inva&s;ion of &s;o opulent a kingdom as France,
to encrea&s;e, rather than dimini&s;h, the riches of the na|tion<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Eacon, p. 602.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the&s;e magnificent vaunts of the
King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1492.</NOTE> all men of penetration concluded, from the per|&s;onal
character of the man, and &s;till more, from the &s;itua|tion
of his affairs, that he had no &s;erious intention of
pu&s;hing the war to &s;uch extremity as he pretended.
France was not now in the &s;ame condition as when &s;uch
&s;ucce&s;sful inroads had been made into her by the former
Kings of England. The great fiefs were united to the
crown; the princes of the blood were de&s;irous of peace
and tranquility; the kingdom abounded with able cap|tains
and veteran &s;oldiers; and the general a&s;pect of its
affairs &s;eemed rather to threaten its neighbours, than to
promi&s;e them any con&s;iderable advantages again&s;t it. The
levity and vain-glory of Maximilian were &s;upported by
his pompous titles; but were ill &s;econded by military
power, and &s;till le&s;s, by any revenue, proportioned to
them. The politic Ferdinand, while he made a &s;how of
war, was actually negotiating for peace; and rather than
expo&s;e him&s;elf to any hazard, would accept of very mo|derate
conce&s;&s;ions from France. Even England was not
<PB N="371" REF="393">
free from dome&s;tic di&s;contents; and in Scotland, the
death of Henry's friend and ally, James the third, who
had been murdered by his rebellious &s;ubjects, had made
way for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his &s;on, James the fourth, who
was devoted to the French intere&s;t, and would &s;urely be
alarmed at any progre&s;s of the Engli&s;h arms. But all
the&s;e obvious con&s;iderations had no influence with the
parliament. Inflamed by the ideas of &s;ubduing France,
and of inriching them&s;elves with the &s;poils of that king|dom,
they gave into the &s;nare prepared for them, and
voted the &s;upply which the King demanded. Two fif|teenths
were granted him; and the better to enable his
va&s;&s;als and nobility to attend him, an act was pa&s;&s;ed,
empowering them to &s;ell their e&s;tates, without paying
any fines for alienation.</P>
<P>THE nobility were univer&s;ally &s;eized with a de&s;ire of
military glory; and having credulou&s;ly &s;wallowed all the
boa&s;ts of the King, they dreamed of no le&s;s than carry|ing
their triumphant arms to the gates of Paris, and put|ting
the crown of France on Henry's head. Many of
them borrowed large &s;ums or &s;old off manors, that they
might appear in the field with greater &s;plendour, and lead
out their followers in more compleat order. The King
cro&s;&s;ed the &s;eas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> and arrived at Calais on the &s;ixth of
October, with an army of twenty-five thou&s;and foot
and &s;ixteen hundred hor&s;e, which he put under the com|mand
of the duke of Bedford and the earl of Oxford:
But as &s;ome inferred, from his opening the campaign in
&s;o late a &s;ea&s;on, that peace would &s;oon be concluded be|tween
the crowns, he was de&s;irous of &s;ugge&s;ting a con|trary
inference. &startq;He had come over,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;to
make an entire conque&s;t of France, which was not
the work of one &s;ummer. It was therefore of no
con&s;equence at what &s;ea&s;on he began the inva&s;ion;
<PB N="372" REF="394" MS="Y">
e&s;pecially as he had Calais ready for winter quarters.&endq;
As if he had &s;eriou&s;ly intended this enterprize, he in|&s;tantly
marched with his army into the enemy's country
and laid &s;iege to Bulloigne:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion of France.</NOTE> But notwith&s;tanding this ap|pearance
of a ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition, there had been &s;ecret
advances made towards a peace above three months be|fore;
and commi&s;&s;ioners had been appointed to treat of
the terms. The better to reconcile the minds of men to
this unexpected mea&s;ure, the King's amba&s;&s;adors arrived
in the camp from the Low Countries, and informed him,
that Maximilian was in no readine&s;s to join him; nor
was any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to be hoped for from that quarter.
Soon after, me&s;&s;engers came from Spain, and brought
news of a peace concluded between that kingdom and
France, in which Charles had made a ce&s;&s;ion of the coun|ties
of Rou&s;&s;illon and Cerdagne to Ferdinand. Tho'
the&s;e articles of intelligence were carefully di&s;per&s;ed thro'
the army, the King was &s;till apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t a &s;udden
peace, after &s;uch magnificent promi&s;es and high expect|ations,
might expo&s;e him to great reproach. In order
the more effectually to cover the intended mea&s;ures, he
&s;ecretly engaged the marqui&s;s of Dor&s;et, together with
twenty three per&s;ons of condition, to pre&s;ent him a pe|tition
for his agreeing to a treaty with France. The pre|tence
was founded on the late &s;ea&s;on of the year, the
difficulty of &s;upplying the army at Calais during winter,
the ob&s;tacles which aro&s;e in the &s;iege of Bulloigne, the
de&s;ertion of tho&s;e allies who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance had been mo&s;t
relied on: Events which might, all of them, have been
fore&s;een before the embarkation of the troops.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of the&s;e preparatory &s;teps, the bi&s;hop
of Exeter and the lord Daubeney were &s;ent to con&s;er at
E&s;taples with the mare&s;chal de Cordes, and to put the la&s;t
hand to the treaty. A few days &s;ufficed for this purpo&s;e:
<PB N="373" REF="395">
The demands of Henry were wholly pecuniary; and the
King of France, who deemed the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
Brittany an equivalent for any money, and who was all
on fire for his projected expedition into Italy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of No|vember. Peace with France.</NOTE> readily
agreed to the propo&s;als made him. He engaged to pay
Henry &s;even hundred and forty-five thou&s;and crowns,
about one hundred and eighty-&s;ix thou&s;and pounds &s;ter|ling;
partly as a reimbur&s;ement of the &s;ums advanced
for Brittany, partly as arrears of the pen&s;ion due to Ed|ward
the fourth. And he &s;tipulated a yearly pen&s;ion to
Henry and his heirs of twenty-five thou&s;and crowns.
Thus the King, as remarked by his hi&s;torian, made profit
upon his &s;ubjects for the war; and upon his enemies for
the peace<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 605. Pol. Virg. p. 586.</NOTE>. And the people agreed, that he had fulfilled
his promi&s;e, when he &s;aid to the parliament, that he
would make the war maintain it&s;elf. Maximilian, was
comprehended in Henry's treaty, if he plea&s;ed to accept
of it; but he di&s;dained to be in any re&s;pect beholden to
an ally, of whom, he thought, he had rea&s;on to com|plain:
He made a &s;eparate peace with France, and ob|tained
re&s;titution of Artois, Franchecomte and Charolois,
which had been given as the dowry of his daughter,
when &s;he was affianced to the King of France.</P>
<P>THE peace, concluded between England and France,
was the more likely to continue, becau&s;e Charles, full
of ambition and youthful hopes, bent all his attention to
the &s;ide of Italy, and &s;oon after undertook the conque&s;t
of Naples; an enterprize, which Henry regarded with
the greater indifference, as Naples lay remote from him,
and France had never, in any age, been &s;ucce&s;sful on
that quarter. The King's authority was fully e&s;tabli&s;hed
at home; and every rebellion, which had been attempted
<PB N="374" REF="396">
again&s;t him, had hitherto tended only to confound his
enemies, and con&s;olidate his power and influence. His
reputation for policy and conduct was every day agument|ing;
his trea&s;ures had encrea&s;ed even from the mo&s;t
unpro&s;perous events; the hopes of all pretenders to his
throne were cut off, as well by his marriage, as by the
i&s;&s;ue which it had brought him. In this promi&s;ing &s;itu|ation,
the King had rea&s;on to flatter him&s;elf with the
pro&s;pect of a durable peace and tranquility: But his in|veterate
and indefatigable enemies, whom he had wan|tonly
provoked, rai&s;ed him up an adver&s;ary, who kept
him long in inquietude, and &s;ometimes even brought him
into danger.</P>
<P>THE dutche&s;s of Burgundy, full of re&s;entment for the
depre&s;&s;ion of her family and its partizans, rather irritated
than di&s;couraged by the ill &s;ucce&s;s of her pa&s;t enterprizes,
was determined at lea&s;t to di&s;turb that government, which
&s;he found it &s;o difficult to &s;ubvert. By means of her
emi&s;&s;aries, &s;he propagated the report, that her nephew,
Richard Plantagenet, duke of York, had e&s;caped from
the Tower when his elder brother was murdered, and
that he lay &s;till &s;omewhere concealed: And finding this
rumour, however improbable, to be greedily received by
the people, &s;he had been looking out for &s;ome young
man, proper to per&s;onate that unfortunate prince.</P>
<P>THERE was one O&s;bec or Warbec, a renegado Jew
of Tournay, who had been carried by &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s to
London in the reign of Edward the fourth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perkin Warbec.</NOTE> and had there
a &s;on born to him. Having had opportunities of being
known to the King, and obtaining his favour, he pre|vailed
with that prince, who&s;e manners were very affable,
to &s;tand godfather to his &s;on, to whom he gave the name
of Peter, corrupted after the Flemi&s;h manner, into Peter|kin,
or Perkin. It was by &s;ome believed, that Edward,
<PB N="375" REF="397">
among his other amorous adventures, had had a &s;ecret
corre&s;pondence with Warbec's wife, and from this in|cident
people accounted for that re&s;emblance, which was
afterwards remarked between young Perkin and that mo|narch<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 606.</NOTE>. Some years after the birth of this child, War|bec
returned to Tournay; where Perkin his &s;on remained
not long, but by different accidents was carried from
place to place, and his birth and fortunes became there|by
unknown, and difficult to be traced by the mo&s;t di|ligent
enquiry. The variety of his adventures had hap|pily
favoured the natural ver&s;atility and &s;agacity of his
genius; and he &s;eemed to be a youth perfectly fitted to
act any part, or a&s;&s;ume any character. In this light he
had been repre&s;ented to the dutche&s;s of Burgundy, who,
&s;truck with the concurrence of &s;o many circum&s;tances
&s;uited to her purpo&s;e, de&s;ired to be made acquainted with
the man, on whom &s;he began already to ground her
hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. She found him to exceed her mo&s;t
&s;anguine expectations;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His im|po&s;ture.</NOTE> &s;o beautiful did he appear in his
per&s;on, &s;o graceful in his air, &s;o courtly in his addre&s;s, &s;o
full of docility and good &s;en&s;e in his behaviour and con|ver&s;ation.
The le&s;&s;ons, which were nece&s;&s;ary to be
taught him, in order to his per&s;onating the duke of York,
were &s;oon learned by a youth of &s;uch quick apprehen&s;ion;
but as the &s;ea&s;on &s;eemed not then favourable for his en|terprize,
Margaret, in order the better to conceal him,
&s;ent him, under the care of Lady Brampton, into Portu|gal,
where he remained a year, unknown to all the world.</P>
<P>THE war, which was then ready to break out between
France and England, &s;eemed to afford a proper oppor|tunity
for the di&s;covery of this new phaenomenon; and
Ireland, which &s;till retained its attachments to the hou&s;e
<PB N="376" REF="398">
of York, was pitched on as the proper place for his fir&s;t
appearance<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg. p. 589.</NOTE>. He landed at Corke; and immediately
a&s;&s;uming the name of Richard Plantagenet, drew to him
partizans among that ignorant and credulous people. He
wrote letters to the earls of De&s;mond and Kildare, in|viting
them to join his party: He di&s;per&s;ed every where
the &s;trange intelligence of his e&s;cape from his uncle
Richard's cruelty; and men, fond of every thing new
and wonderful, began to make him the general &s;ubject of
their di&s;cour&s;e, and even the object of their favour.</P>
<P>THE news &s;oon reached France; and Charles, prompt|ed
by the private &s;ollicitations of the dutche&s;s of Bur|gundy,
and the intrigues of one Frion, a &s;ecretary of
Henry, who had de&s;erted his &s;ervice, &s;ent Perkin an in|vitation
to repair to him at Paris. He received him with
all the marks of regard due to the duke of York; &s;ettled
on him a hand&s;ome pen&s;ion, a&s;&s;igned him magnificent
lodgings, and in order to provide at once for his dignity
and &s;ecurity, gave him a guard for his per&s;on, of which
lord Congre&s;all accepted the office of captain. The
French courtiers readily embraced a fiction, which their
&s;overeign thought it his intere&s;t to adopt: Perkin, both
by his deportment and per&s;on, &s;upported the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
which was &s;pread abroad of his royal pedigree: And
the whole kingdom was full of the accompli&s;hments as
well as &s;ingular adventures and misfortunes, of the young
Plantagenet. Wonders of this nature are commonly
augmented at a di&s;tance. From France, the admiration
and credulity diffu&s;ed them&s;elves into England: Sir
George Neville, Sir John Taylor, and above a hundred
gentlemen more came to Paris, in order to offer their &s;er|vice
to the &s;uppo&s;ed duke of York, and to &s;hare his
<PB N="377" REF="399">
fortunes: And the impo&s;tor had now the appearance of
a court attending him, and began to entertain hopes of
final &s;ucce&s;s in his undertakings.</P>
<P>WHEN peace was concluded between France and Eng|land
at E&s;taples, Henry applied to have Perkin put into
his hands; but Charles, re&s;olute not to betray a young
man, of whatever birth, whom he had invited into his
kingdom, would agree only to di&s;mi&s;s him. The pre|tended
Plantagenet retired to the dutche&s;s of Burgundy
in Flanders, and craving her protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
offered to lay before her all the proofs of that birth, to
which he laid claim.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is a|vowed
by the dutch|e&s;s of Bur|gundy.</NOTE> The prince&s;s affected ignorance
of his preten&s;ions; even put on the appearance of di&s;tru&s;t;
and having, as &s;he &s;aid, been already deceived by Sim|nel's
claim, &s;he was determined never again to be &s;e|duced
by any impo&s;tor. She de&s;ired before all the world
to be in&s;tructed in his rea&s;ons for a&s;&s;uming the name
which he bore; &s;eemed to examine every circum&s;tance
with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous nicety; put many particular
que&s;tions to him; affected a&s;toni&s;hment at his an&s;wers;
and at la&s;t, after long and &s;evere &s;crutiny, bur&s;t out in|to
joy and admiration at his wonderful delivery, em|braced
him as her nephew, the true image of Edward,
the &s;ole heir of the Plantagenets, and the legitimate
&s;ucce&s;&s;or of the Engli&s;h throne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1493.</NOTE> She immediately a&s;|&s;igned
him an equipage, &s;uited to his pretended
birth; appointed him a guard of thirty halberdiers;
engaged every one to pay court to him; and on all
occa&s;ions honoured him with the appellation of the
<HI>White Ro&s;e of England.</HI> The Flemings, moved by
the authority, which Margaret, both from her rank
and per&s;onal character, enjoyed among them, readily
adopted the fiction of Perkin's royal de&s;cent: No &s;ur|mize
<PB N="378" REF="400">
of his true birth was as yet heard of: Little con|tradiction
was made to the prevailing opinion: And the
Engli&s;h, from their great communication with the na|tives
of the Low Countries, were every day more and
more prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of the impo&s;tor.</P>
<P>IT was not the populace alone of England, that gave
credit to Perkin's preten&s;ions. Men of the highe&s;t birth
and quality, di&s;gu&s;ted with Henry's government, by
which they found the nobility depre&s;&s;ed, began to turn
their eyes towards this new claimant, and &s;ome of them
even entered into a corre&s;pondence with him. Lord
Fitzwater,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and by ma|ny of the Engli&s;h no|bility.</NOTE> Sir Simon Mountfort, Sir Thomas Thwaites
betrayed their inclination towards him: Sir William
Stanley him&s;elf, lord chamberlain, who had been &s;o
active in rai&s;ing Henry to the throne, moved either by
blind credulity or a re&s;tle&s;s ambition, entertained the
project of a revolt in favour of his enemy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 608.</NOTE>. Sir Ro|bert
Clifford and William Barley were &s;till more open
in their mea&s;ures: They went over to Flanders, offered
their &s;ervice to Perkin, and were introduced by the dut|che&s;s
of Burgundy to his acquaintance. Clifford wrote
back to England, that he knew perfectly the per&s;on of
Richard duke of York, that this young man was un|doubtedly
that prince him&s;elf, and that no circum&s;tance
of his &s;tory was expo&s;ed to the lea&s;t difficulty. Such
po&s;itive intelligence, conveyed by a per&s;on of &s;uch high
rank and character, was &s;ufficient with many to put
the matter beyond all que&s;tion, and excited the wonder
and attention even of the mo&s;t indifferent. The whole
nation was held in &s;u&s;pence; a regular con&s;piracy was
formed again&s;t the King's authority; and a corre&s;pon|dence
&s;ettled between the malecontents in Flanders and
tho&s;e in England.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="401">
THE King was well informed of all the&s;e particu|lars;
but agreeable to his character, which was both
cautious and re&s;olute, he proceeded very deliberately,
but &s;teadily, in counter-working the projects of his ene|mies.
His fir&s;t object was to a&s;certain the death of the
real duke of York, and to confirm the opinion, which
had always prevailed with regard to that event. Five
per&s;ons had been employed by Richard in the murder
of his nephews; Sir James Tirrel, to whom he had
committed the government of the Tower for that pur|po&s;e,
and who had &s;een the dead princes; Forre&s;t, Digh|ton,
and Slater, who perpetrated the action; and the
prie&s;t who buried the bodies. Tirrel and Dighton alone
were alive, and they agreed in the &s;ame &s;tory; but as
the prie&s;t was dead, and as the bodies had been re|moved
by Richard's orders from the place where they
were fir&s;t interred, and could not now be found, it was
not in Henry's power to put the fact, &s;o much as he
wi&s;hed, beyond all doubt and controver&s;y.</P>
<P>HE met at fir&s;t with more difficulty, but was in the
end more &s;ucce&s;sful, in detecting who this wonderful
per&s;on was that thus boldly advanced preten&s;ions to his
crown. He di&s;per&s;ed his &s;pies all over Flanders and
England; he engaged many to pretend that they had
embraced Perkin's party; he directed them to in&s;i|nuate
them&s;elves into the confidence of his friends; in
proportion as they conveyed intelligence of any con&s;pi|rator,
he bribed his retainers, his dome&s;tic &s;ervants, nay
&s;ometimes his confe&s;&s;or, and by the&s;e means traced up
&s;ome other confederate; Clifford him&s;elf he engaged by
hopes of reward and pardon, to betray the &s;ecrets com|mitted
to him; the more tru&s;t he gave any of his &s;pies,
the higher re&s;entment did he feign again&s;t them; &s;ome
of them he even cau&s;ed to be excommunicated and pub|licly
<PB N="380" REF="402">
anathematized, in order the better to procure them
the confidence of his enemies: And in the i&s;&s;ue, the
whole plan of the con&s;piracy was laid clearly before him;
and the pedigree, adventures, life and conver&s;ation of
the pretended duke of York. This latter part of the
&s;tory was immediately publi&s;hed for the &s;atisfaction of
the nation: The con&s;pirators he re&s;erved for a &s;lower
and more &s;ecure vengeance.</P>
<P>MEAN WHILE, he remon&s;trated with the archduke
Philip,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1494.</NOTE> on account of the countenance and protection,
which was afforded in his dominions to &s;o infamous an
impo&s;ture; contrary to treaties &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the
&s;overeigns, and to the mutual amity, which had &s;o
long been maintained by the &s;ubjects of both &s;tates.
Margaret had intere&s;t enough to get his applications
rejected; on pretence that Philip had no authority
over the deme&s;nes of the dutche&s;s dowager. And
the King, in re&s;entment of this injury, cut off all
commerce with the Low Countries, bani&s;hed the Fle|mings
from England, and recalled his own &s;ubjects
from the&s;e provinces. Philip retaliated by like edicts;
but Henry knew, that &s;o mutinous a people as the Flem|ings
would not long bear, in compliance with the hu|mours
of their prince, to be deprived of &s;o beneficial a
branch of commerce as that which they carried on with
England.</P>
<P>HE had it in his power to inflict more effectual pu|ni&s;hment
on his dome&s;tic enemies; and when his pro|jects
were &s;ufficiently matured, he failed not to make
them feel the effects of his re&s;entment. Almo&s;t in the
&s;ame in&s;tant, he arre&s;ted Fitzwater, Mountfort, and
Thwaites, together with William Daubeney, Robert
Ratcliff, Thomas Cre&s;&s;enor, and Thomas A&s;twood.
<PB N="381" REF="403">
All the&s;e were arraigned, convicted, and condemned for
high trea&s;on, in adhering and promi&s;ing aid to Perkin.
Mountfort, Ratcliff, and Daubeney were immediately
executed: Fitzwater was &s;ent over to Calais, and re|tained
in cu&s;tody; but having practised on his keeper
for an e&s;cape, he &s;oon after underwent the &s;ame fate.
The re&s;t were pardoned, together with William Wor&s;e|ley,
dean of St. Paul's, and &s;ome others, who had been
accu&s;ed and examined, but not brought to public trial<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 592.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>GREATER and more &s;olemn preparations were deem|ed
requi&s;ite for the trial of Stanley, lord chamberlain,
who&s;e authority in the nation, who&s;e dome&s;tic connex|ions
with the King, as well as his former great &s;ervices,
&s;eemed to &s;ecure him again&s;t any accu&s;ation or pu|ni&s;hment.
Clifford was directed to come over privately
to England, and to throw him&s;elf at the King's feet,
while placed at the council-table; craving pardon for
his pa&s;t offences, and offering to atone for them by any
&s;ervices, which &s;hould be required of him. Henry told
him, that the be&s;t proof he could give of penitence, and
the only &s;ervice he could now render him, was the full
confe&s;&s;ion of his guilt, and the di&s;covery of all his
ac|complices,
however di&s;tingui&s;hed by rank or character.
Encouraged by this exhortation, Clifford accu&s;ed Stan|ley
then pre&s;ent, as his chief abettor; and offered to lay
before the council the whole proof of his guilt. Stanley
him&s;elf could not di&s;cover more &s;urprize than was affected
by Henry on this occa&s;ion. He received the intelligence
as ab&s;olutely fal&s;e and incredible; that a man, to whom
he was in a great mea&s;ure beholden for his crown, and
even for his life; a man, to whom, by every honour
and favour, he had endeavoured to expre&s;s his gratitude;
<PB N="382" REF="404">
who&s;e brother, the earl of Derby, was the King's father-in-law;
to whom he had even committed the tru&s;t of his per|&s;on,
by creating him lord chamberlain: That this man,
enjoying his full confidence and affection, not actuated
by any motive of di&s;content or apprehen&s;ion, &s;hould en|gage
in a con&s;piracy again&s;t him. Clifford was there|fore
exhorted to weigh well the con&s;equences of this
accu&s;ation; but as he per&s;i&s;ted in the &s;ame po&s;itive a&s;&s;e|verations,
Stanley was committed to cu&s;tody, and was
&s;oon after examined before the council<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 611. Polyd. Virg. p. 593.</NOTE>. He denied not
the guilt imputed to him by Clifford; he did not even
endeavour much to extenuate it; whether he thought
that a frank and open confe&s;&s;ion would &s;erve for an
atonement, or tru&s;ted to his pre&s;ent connexions, and his
former &s;ervices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tri$$ and execution of Stanley.</NOTE> for pardon and &s;ecurity. But princes
are often apt to regard great &s;ervices as a ground of
jealou&s;y, e&s;pecially if accompanied with a craving and
re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition, in the per&s;on who has performed
them. The general di&s;content al&s;o, and mutinous hu|mour
of the people, &s;eemed to require &s;ome great example
of &s;everity. And as Stanley was one of the mo&s;t opulent
&s;ubjects in the kingdom, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of above three
thou&s;and pounds a year in land, and forty thou&s;and marks
in plate and money,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1495.</NOTE> be&s;ides other property of great va|lue,
the pro&s;pect of &s;o rich a forfeiture was deemed no
&s;mall motive in Henry for proceeding to extremity
again&s;t him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th Feb.</NOTE> After &s;ix weeks delay, which was inter|po&s;ed
in order to &s;hew that the King was re&s;trained by
doubts and &s;cruples; he was brought to his trial, con|demned,
and pre&s;ently after beheaded. Hi&s;torians are
not well agreed with regard to the crime which was proved again&s;t him. The general report is, that he
<PB N="383" REF="405">
&s;hould have &s;aid in confidence to Clifford, that, if he
was &s;ure the young man, who appeared in Flanders,
was really &s;on to King Edward, he never would bear
arms again&s;t him. This &s;entiment might di&s;gu&s;t Henry
as implying a preference of the hou&s;e of York to that of
Lanca&s;ter, but could &s;carcely be the ground, even in
tho&s;e arbitrary times, of a &s;entence of high trea&s;on again&s;t
Stanley. It is more probable, therefore, as is a&s;&s;erted
by &s;ome hi&s;torians, that he had expre&s;sly engaged to a&s;|&s;i&s;t
Perkin, and had actually &s;ent him &s;ome &s;upply of
money.</P>
<P>THE fate of Stanley made great impre&s;&s;ion on the
whole kingdom, and &s;truck all Perkin's retainers with
the deepe&s;t di&s;may. From Clifford's de&s;ertion, they found
that all their &s;ecrets were di&s;covered; and as it appeared,
that Stanley, while he &s;eemed to live in the greate&s;t
confidence with the King, had been continually &s;ur|rounded
by &s;pies, who reported and regi&s;tered every ac|tion
which he committed, nay, every word which fell
from him, a general di&s;tru&s;t took place, and all mutual
confidence was de&s;troyed, even among the mo&s;t intimate
friends and acquaintance. The jealous and &s;evere tem|per
of the King, together with his great reputation for
&s;agacity and penetration, kept men in awe, and quelled
not only the movements of &s;edition, but the very mur|murs
of faction. Libels, however, crept out again&s;t
Henry's per&s;on and admini&s;tration; and being greedily
propagated, by every &s;ecret art, &s;howed that there &s;till
remained among the people a con&s;iderable root of di&s;|content,
which wanted only a proper opportunity to di&s;|cover
it&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT Henry continued more intent on increa&s;ing the
terrors of his people, that on gaining their affections.
Tru&s;ting to the great &s;ucce&s;s which attended him in
<PB N="384" REF="406">
all his enterprizes, he gave every day, more and more,
a loo&s;e to his rapacious temper, and employed the arts
of perverted law and ju&s;tice, in order to exact fines and
compositions from his people. Sir William Capel, al|derman
of London, was comdemned on &s;ome penal &s;ta|tutes
to pay the &s;um of 2743 pounds, and was obliged to
compound for &s;ixteen hundred and fifteen. This was the
fir&s;t noted ca&s;e of that nature; but it became a precedent,
which prepared the way for many others. The manage|ment,
indeed, of the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive arts was the great &s;ecret
of the King's admini&s;tration. While he depre&s;&s;ed the
nobility, he exalted and honoured and care&s;&s;ed the law|yers;
and by that means both be&s;towed authority on the
laws, and was enabled, whenever he plea&s;ed, to pervert
them to his own advantage. His government was op|pre&s;&s;ive;
but it was &s;o much the le&s;s burthen&s;ome, as, by
extending his own authority, and curbing the nobles,
he became in reality the &s;ole oppre&s;&s;or in his king|dom.</P>
<P>As Perkin found, that the King's authority gained
ground daily among the people, and that his own pre|ten&s;ions
were becoming ob&s;olete, he re&s;olved to attempt
&s;omething, which might revive the hopes and expectations
of his partizans. Having gathered together a band of
outlaws, pirates, robbers, and nece&s;&s;itous per&s;ons of all
nations, to the number of 600 men, he put to &s;ea with
a re&s;olution of making a de&s;cent in England; and of ex|citing
the common people to arms, &s;ince all his cor|re&s;pondence
with the nobility was cut off by Henry's
vigilance and &s;everity. Information being brought him,
that the King had made a progre&s;s to the north, he ca&s;t
anchor on the coa&s;t of Kent, and &s;ent &s;ome of his re|tainers
a&s;hore, who invited the country to join him.
The gentlemen of Kent gathered together &s;ome troops
<PB N="385" REF="407">
to oppo&s;e him; but they propo&s;ed to do more e&s;&s;ential
&s;ervice than by repelling the inva&s;ion: They carried
the &s;emblance of friend&s;hip to Perkin, and invited him
to come him&s;elf a&s;hore, in order to take the command
over them. But the wary youth, ob&s;erving that they
had more order and regularity in their movements than
could be &s;uppo&s;ed in new levied forces, who had taken
arms again&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed authority, refu&s;ed to commit
him&s;elf into their hands; and the Kenti&s;h troops de&s;pair|ing
of &s;ucce&s;s in their &s;tratagem, &s;et upon &s;uch of his
retainers, as were already landed; and be&s;ides &s;ome who
were &s;lain and &s;ome who e&s;caped, they took an hundred
and fifty pri&s;oners. The&s;e were tried and condemned;
and all of them executed, by order from the King, who
was re&s;olved to u&s;e no mixture of lenity towards men of
&s;uch de&s;perate fortunes<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 595.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS year a Parliament was &s;ummoned in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE>
and another in Ireland; and &s;ome remarkable laws were
pa&s;&s;ed in both countries. The Engli&s;h Parliament en|acted,
that no per&s;on who &s;hould by arms or otherwi&s;e
a&s;&s;i&s;t the King for the time being, &s;hould ever afterwards,
either by cour&s;e of law or act of Parliament, be attainted
for &s;uch an in&s;tance of obedience. This &s;tatute might
be expo&s;ed to &s;ome blame, as favourable to u&s;urpers;
were there any preci&s;e rules, which always, even during
the mo&s;t factious times, could determine the true &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or,
and render every one inexcu&s;able, who did not
&s;ubmit to him. But as the titles of princes are then the
great &s;ubject of di&s;pute, and each party pleads topics
in their own favour, it &s;eems but equitable to &s;ecure
tho&s;e who act in &s;upport of public tranquillity, an object
at all times of undoubted benefit and importance. Hen|ry,
con&s;cious of his di&s;puted title, promoted this law in
<PB N="386" REF="408">
order to &s;ecure his partizans again&s;t all events; but as
he had him&s;elf ob&s;erved a different practice with regad
to Richard's adherents, he had rea&s;on to apprehend, that,
during the violence which u&s;ually en&s;ues on public con|vul&s;ions,
his example, rather than his law, would, in
ca&s;e of a new revolution, be followed by his enemies.
And the attempt to bind the legi&s;lature it&s;elf, by pre|&s;cribing
rules to future Parliaments, was plainly contra|dictory
to the fundamental principles of political govern|ment.</P>
<P>THIS Parliament al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed an act, impowering the
King to levy, by cour&s;e of law, all the &s;ums which any
per&s;on had agreed to pay by way of benevolence: A
&s;tatute, by which that arbitrary method of taxation was
indirectly authorized and ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>THE King's authority appeared equally prevalent and
uncontrolable in Ireland. Sir Edward Poynings had
been &s;ent over with &s;ome troops into that country, with
an intention of quelling the partizans of the hou&s;e of
York, and of reducing the natives to &s;ubjection. He
was not &s;upported with forces &s;ufficient for that important
enterprize: The Iri&s;h, by flying into their woods, and
mora&s;&s;es, and mountains, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, eluded his
efforts: But Poynings &s;ummoned a parliament at Dub|lin,
where he was more &s;ucce&s;sful. He pa&s;&s;ed that me|morable
&s;tatute, which &s;till bears his name, and which
e&s;tabli&s;hes the authority of the Engli&s;h government in
Ireland. By this &s;tatute, all the former laws of Eng|land
were made to be of force in Ireland; and no bill
can be introduced into the Iri&s;h parliament, unle&s;s it
previou&s;ly receive the &s;anction of the council of England.
This latter laws &s;eems calculated for en&s;uring the domi|nion
of the Engli&s;h over Ireland; but was really grant|ed
at the de&s;ire of the Iri&s;h Commons, who propo&s;ed,
<PB N="387" REF="409" MS="Y">
by that means, to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the tyranny of
their lords, particularly of &s;uch lieutenants as were of
Iri&s;h birth<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sir John Davis, p. 235.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE Henry's authority was thus e&s;tabli&s;hed
throughout his dominions, and general tranquillity pre|vailed,
the whole continent was thrown into combu&s;tion
by the French inva&s;ion of Italy, and by the rapid &s;ucce&s;s
which attended Charles in that ra&s;h and ill-concerted
enterprize. The Italians, who had entirely lo&s;t the u&s;e
of arms, and who, in the mid&s;t of continual wars, had
become every day more unwarlike, were a&s;toni&s;hed to
meet with an enemy, that made the field of battle, not
a pompous tournament, but a &s;cene of blood, and &s;ought
at the hazard of their own lives the death of their ene|my.
Their e&s;&s;eminate troops were di&s;&s;ipated every where
on the approach of the French army: Their be&s;t forti|fied
cities opened their gates: Kingdoms and &s;tates
were in an in&s;tant overturned: And thro' the whole
length of Italy, which the French penetrated without
re&s;i&s;tance, they &s;eemed rather to be taking quarters in
their own country, than making conque&s;ts over an ene|my.
The maxims, which the Italians, during that
age, followed in negotiations, were as ill calculated to
&s;upport their &s;tates, as the habits to which they were ad|dicted
in war. A treacherous, deceitful, and incon&s;lant
&s;y&s;tem of politics prevailed; and even tho&s;e &s;mall remains
of fidelity and honour, which were pre&s;erved in the
councils of the other European princes, were ridiculed
in Italy, as proofs of ignorance and ru&s;ticity. Ludovico,
duke of Milan, who invited the French to invade Naples,
had never de&s;ired nor expected their &s;ucce&s;s; and was
the fir&s;t alarmed at the pro&s;perous i&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e projects,
which he him&s;elf had concerted. By his intrigues a
<PB N="388" REF="410">
league was formed among &s;everal potentates to oppo&s;e
the progre&s;s of Charles's conque&s;ts and &s;ecure their own
independency. This league was compo&s;ed of Ludovico
him&s;elf, the pope, Maximilian King of the Romans,
Ferdinand of Spain, and the republic of Venice. Henry
too entered into the confederacy; but was not put to
any expence or trouble in con&s;equence of his engage|ments.
The King of France, terrified by &s;o powerful
a combination, retired from Naples with the greate&s;t
part of his army, and returned to France. The forces,
which he left in his new conque&s;ts, partly by the revolt
of the inhabitants, partly by the inva&s;ion of the Spa|niards,
were &s;oon after &s;ubdued; and the whole king|dom
of Naples &s;uddenly returned to its allegiance under
Ferdinand, &s;on to Alphon&s;o, who had been &s;uddenly
expelled by the irruption of the French. Ferdinand
died &s;oon after; and left his uncle, Frederic, in peace|able
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne.</P>

<P>AFTER Perkin was repul&s;ed from the coa&s;t of Kent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XXVI.</NOTE>
he retired into Flanders; but as he found it im|po&s;&s;ible
to find &s;ub&s;i&s;tance for him&s;elf and his followers,
while he remained in tranquillity, he &s;oon after made an
attempt upon Ireland, which had always appeared for|ward
to join every invader of Henry's authority. But
Poynings had now put the affairs of that i&s;land in &s;o good
a po&s;ture, that Perkin met with little &s;ucce&s;s; and being
tired of &s;avage life, which he was obliged to lead,
while &s;kulking among the wild Iri&s;h, he bent his cour&s;e
towards Scotland, and pre&s;ented him&s;elf to James the
fourth, who then governed that kingdom. He had been
previou&s;ly recommended to that prince by the King of
France, who was di&s;gu&s;ted at Henry for entering into
the league again&s;t him; and this recommendation was
even &s;econded by Maximilian, who, tho' one of the con|federates,
&s;tood on ill terms with the King, on account
<PB N="390" REF="412">
of his prohibition of commerce with the Low Countries.
The countenance given to Perkin by the&s;e princes pro|cured
him a favourable reception with the King of Scot|land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perkin retires to Scotland.</NOTE> who a&s;&s;ured him, that, whatever he were, he ne|ver
&s;hould repent the putting him&s;elf into his hands<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bacon, p. 615. Polydore Virigil, p. 596, 597.</NOTE>:
The in&s;inuating addre&s;s and plau&s;ible behaviour of the
youth him&s;elf &s;eem even to have gained him credit and
authority. James, whom years had not yet taught di&s;|tru&s;t
and caution, was &s;educed to believe the &s;tory of
Perkin's birth and adventures; and he carried his con|fidence
&s;o far as to give him in marriage the lady Cathe|rine
Gordon, daughter of the earl of Huntley, and a
near kin&s;woman of his own; a young lady too, eminent
for virtue as well as beauty.</P>
<P>THERE &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at that time a great jealou&s;y between
the courts of England and Scotland;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1496.</NOTE> and James was
probably the more forward on that account to adopt any
fiction, which, he thought, might reduce his enemy to
di&s;tre&s;s or difficulty. He &s;uddenly re&s;olved to make an
inroad into England, attended with &s;ome of the border|ers;
and he carried Perkin along with him, in hopes,
that the appearance of the pretended prince might rai&s;e
an in&s;urrection in the northern counties. Perkin him&s;elf
di&s;per&s;t a manife&s;to, in which he &s;et forth his own &s;tory,
and craved the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all his &s;ubjects in expelling
the u&s;urper, who&s;e tyranny and mal-admini&s;tration,
who&s;e depre&s;&s;ion of the nobility by the elevation of mean
per&s;ons, who&s;e oppre&s;&s;ion of the people by multiplied im|po&s;itions
and vexations, had ju&s;tly, he &s;aid, rendered
him odious to all men. But Perkin's preten&s;ions, at|tended
by repeated di&s;appointments, were now become
&s;tale in the eyes even of the populace; and the ho&s;tile
<PB N="391" REF="413">
di&s;po&s;itions, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the kingdoms, ren|dered
a prince, &s;upported by the Scots, but an unwelcome
pre&s;ent to the Engli&s;h nation. The ravages al&s;o, com|mitted
by the borderers, accu&s;tomed to licence and di&s;|order,
&s;truck a terror into all men; and made the people
prepare rather for repelling the invaders than for joining
them. Perkin, that he might &s;upport his preten&s;ions to
royal birth, feigned great compa&s;&s;ion for the mi&s;ery of
his plundered &s;ubjects; and publicly remon&s;trated with his
only again&s;t the depredations exerci&s;ed by the Scots army<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 598.</NOTE>:
But James told him, that he doubted his concern was
only employed in behalf of his enemy, and that he was
anxious to pre&s;erve what never &s;hould belong to him.
That prince now began to perceive, that his attempt
would be fruitle&s;s; and hearing of an army, which was
on its march to attack him, he thought proper to retreat
into his own country.</P>
<P>THE King di&s;covered little anxiety to procure either
reparation or vengeance for this in&s;ult committed on him
by the Scots nation: His chief concern was to draw ad|vantage
from it, by the pretence which it would afford
him to levy impo&s;itions on his own &s;ubjects. He &s;um|moned
a parliament, to whom he made bitter complaints
again&s;t the irruption of the Scots, the ab&s;urd impo&s;ture
which was countenanced by that nation, the cruel de|va&s;tation
which they had &s;pread in the northern counties,
and the multiplied in&s;ults which had thus been offered
both to the King and kingdom of England. The par|liament
made the expected return to this di&s;cour&s;e of the
King, granting him a &s;ub&s;idy to the amount of 120,000
pounds, together with two fifteenths. After making
this grant, they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="414">
THE vote of parliament for impo&s;ing the tax was
without much difficulty procured by the authority of
Henry;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1497.</NOTE> but he found it not &s;o ea&s;y to levy the money
upon his &s;ubjects. The people, who were acquainted
with the immen&s;e trea&s;ures ama&s;&s;ed by the King, could
ill brook the new impo&s;itions rai&s;ed on every &s;light occa|&s;ion;
and it is probable, that the &s;law, which was uni|ver&s;ally
known to lie in his title, made his reign the more
&s;ubject to in&s;urrections and rebellions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrection in the We&s;t.</NOTE> When the &s;ub|&s;idy
began to be levied in Cornwal, the inhabitants,

Scots, from which they e&s;teemed them&s;elves entirely &s;e|cure,
and which had u&s;ually been repelled by the force
of the northern counties. Their ill humour was farther
incited by one Michael Jo&s;eph, a &s;arrier of Bodmin, a
notable talking fellow, who, by thru&s;ting him&s;elf for|ward
on every occa&s;ion, and being loude&s;t in every com|plaint

among the&s;e rude people. Thomas Flammoc too, a
lawyer, who had become the oracle of the neighbour|hood,
encouraged the &s;edition, by informing them, that
the tax, tho' impo&s;ed by parliament, was entirely illegal;
that the northern nobility were obliged, by their tenures,
to defend the nation again&s;t the Scots; and that if the&s;e
new impo&s;itions were tamely &s;ubmitted to, the avarice of
Henry and of his courtiers would &s;oon render the bur|then
intolerable to the nation. A petition, he &s;aid,
mu&s;t be delivered to the King, &s;econded by &s;uch force
as would give it authority; and in order to procure
the concurrence of the re&s;t of the kingdom, care mu&s;t
be taken, by their orderly deportment, to &s;hew that they
had nothing in view but the public good, and the re|dre&s;s
of all tho&s;e grievances, under which the people had
&s;o long laboured.</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="415">
ENCOURAGED by the&s;e &s;peeches, the multitude fltocked
together, and armed them&s;elves with axes, bills, bows,
and &s;uch weapons as country people are u&s;ually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of. Flammoc and Jo&s;eph were cho&s;en their leaders.
They &s;oon conducted the Corni&s;h thro' the county of
Devon, and reached that of Somer&s;et. At Taunton the
rebels killed, in their fury, an officious and eager commi&s;|&s;ioner
of the &s;ub&s;idy, whom they called the provo&s;t of
Perin. When they reached Wells, they were joined
by lord Audley, a nobleman of an antient family, po|pular
in his deportment, but vain, ambitious, and re&s;t|le&s;s
in his temper. He had from the beginning enter|tained
a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with the fir&s;t movers of
the in&s;urrection; and was now joyfully received by them
as their leader. Proud of the countenance given them
by &s;o con&s;iderable a nobleman, they pu&s;hed on their
march; breathing de&s;truction to the King's mini&s;ters
and favourites, particularly Morton, now a cardinal,
and Sir Reginald Bray, who were deemed his mo&s;t
active in&s;truments in all his oppre&s;&s;ions. Amid&s;t their
rage again&s;t the admini&s;tration, they carefully followed
the directions given them by their leaders; and as they
met with no re&s;i&s;tance, they committed, during their
march, no violence or di&s;order.</P>
<P>THE rebels had been told by Flammoc, that the in|habitants
of Kent, as they had ever, during all ages,
remained un&s;ubdued, and had even maintained their in|dependancy
during the Norman conque&s;t, would &s;urely
embrace their party, and declare them&s;elves for a cau&s;e,
which was no other than that of public good and ge|neral
liberty. But the Kenti&s;h people had very lately
di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by repelling Perkin's inva&s;ion;
and having received from the King many gracious ac|knowledgments
for this &s;ervice, their affections were,
<PB N="394" REF="416">
by that means, much conciliated to his government. It
was ea&s;y, therefore, for the earl of Kent, lord Aberga|venny,
and lord Cobham, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great authority
in tho&s;e parts, to retain the people in obedience; and
the Corni&s;h rebels, though they pitched their camp near
Eltham, at the very gates of London, and invited all
the people to join them, got reinforcement from no quar|ter.
There wanted not di&s;contents every where, but
no one would take part in &s;o ra&s;h and ill-concerted an
enterprize; and the &s;ituation in which the King's affairs
then &s;tood, di&s;couraged even the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t daring.</P>
<P>HENRY, in order to oppo&s;e the Scots, had already
levied an army, which he put under the command of
lord Daubeney, the chamberlain; and &s;o &s;oon as he
heard of the Corni&s;h in&s;urrection he ordered it to
march &s;outhwards, and &s;uppre&s;s the rebels. Not to leave
the northern frontier defencele&s;s, he di&s;patched thither
the earl of Surry, who &s;ummoned out the forces on the
borders, and made head again&s;t the enemy. Henry found
here the concurrence of the three mo&s;t fatal incidents,
which can befal a monarchy; a foreign enemy, a do|me&s;tic
rebellion, and a pretender to his throne; but he
enjoyed great re&s;ources in his army and trea&s;ure, and
&s;till more, in the intrepidity and courage of his own
temper. He gave not, however, immediately full &s;cope
to his military &s;pirit. On other occa&s;ions, he had al|ways
ha&s;tened to a deci&s;ion, and it was an u&s;ual &s;aying
with him, <HI>that he de&s;ired but to &s;ee his rebels:</HI> But as the
Corni&s;h in&s;urgents behaved in an inoffen&s;ive manner,
and committed no &s;poil on the country; as they received
no acce&s;&s;ion of force on their march or in their encamp|ment;
and as &s;uch ha&s;ty and popular tumults might be
expected to dimini&s;h every moment by delay; he took
po&s;t in London, and carefully prepared the means of en|&s;uring the victory.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="417">
AFTER all his forces were collected, he divided them
into three bodies, and marched out to a&s;&s;ail the enemy.
The fir&s;t body, commanded by the earl of Oxford, and
under him by the earls of E&s;&s;ex and Suffolk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Blackheath.</NOTE> were ap|pointed
to place them&s;elves behind the hill on which the
rebels were encamped: The &s;econd and mo&s;t con&s;iderable,
Henry put under the command of lord Daubeney, and
ordered him to attack the enemy in front, and bring on
the action. The third, he kept as a body of re&s;erve
about his own per&s;on, and took po&s;t in St. George's
field; where he &s;ecured the city, and could ea&s;ily, as
occa&s;ion &s;erved, either re&s;tore the fight or fini&s;h the vic|tory.
To put the enemy off their guard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 22d.</NOTE> he had &s;pread
a report that he was not to attack them till &s;ome days
after; and the better to confirm them in this opinion,
he began not the action till near the evening. Dau|beney,
beat a detachment of the rebels from Deptford|bridge;
and before the main body could be in order to
receive him, he had gained the a&s;cent of the hill, and
placed him&s;elf in array before them. They were very
formidable for their numbers, being &s;ixteen thou&s;and
&s;trong, and were not defective in valour; but being tu|multuary
troops, ill armed, and unprovided of cavalry
or artillery, they were but an unequal match for the
King's forces. Daubeney began the attack with cour|age,
and even with a contempt of the enemy, which
had almo&s;t proved fatal to him. He ru&s;hed into the
mid&s;t of them, and was taken pri&s;oner; but &s;oon after
was relieved by his own troops. After &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance,
the rebels were broke, and put to flight<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 601.</NOTE>. Lord Audley,
Flammoc, and Jo&s;eph, their leaders, were taken, and
all three executed. The latter &s;eemed even to exult in
his end, and boa&s;ted, with a prepo&s;terous ambition, that
<PB N="396" REF="418">
he &s;hould make a figure in hi&s;tory. The rebels, being
&s;urrounded on every &s;ide by the King's troops, were al|mo&s;t
all made pri&s;oners; and immediately di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with|out
farther puni&s;hment: Whether, that Henry was Sa|tisfied
with the victims who had fallen in the field, and
who amounted to near two thou&s;and, or that he pitied the
ignorance and &s;implicity of the multitude, or favoured them
on account of their inoffen&s;ive behaviour, or was plea&s;ed
that they had never, during their in&s;urrection, di&s;puted his
title, and had &s;hewn no attachment to the hou&s;e of York,
the mo&s;t capital crime of which, in his eyes, they could
have been guilty.</P>
<P>THE Scotti&s;h King was not idle during the&s;e commo|tions
in England. He levied a con&s;iderable army, and
&s;at down before the ca&s;tle of Norham in Northumber|land;
but found that place, by the precaution of Fox,
bi&s;hop of Durham, &s;o well provided both in men and
ammunition, that he made little or no progre&s;s in the
&s;iege. Hearing that the earl of Surry had collected &s;ome
forces and was advancing upon him, he retreated back|wards
into his own country, and left the frontiers ex|po&s;ed
to the inroads of the Engli&s;h general, who be|&s;ieged
and took Aiton, a &s;mall ca&s;tle lying a &s;ew miles
beyond Berwic. The&s;e un&s;ucce&s;sful or frivolous attempts
on both &s;ides, progno&s;ticated a &s;peedy end to the war;
and Henry, notwith&s;tanding his &s;uperior force, was no
le&s;s de&s;irous than James of terminating the differences
between the nations. Not to depart, however, from his
dignity, by making the fir&s;t advances towards peace, he
employed in this friendly office Peter Hialas, a man of
addre&s;s and learning, who had come to him as amba&s;&s;ador
from Ferdinand and I&s;abella, and who was charged with
a commi&s;&s;ion of negotiating the marriage of the infanta
<PB N="397" REF="419">
Catherine, their daughter, with Arthur prince of
Wales<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 603.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HIALAS took a journey northwards, and offered his
mediation between James and Henry, as mini&s;ter of a
prince, who was in alliance with both potentates.
Commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;oon appointed to meet, and confer
on the terms of accommodation. The fir&s;t demand of
the Engli&s;h was, that Perkin &s;hould be put into their
hands; but James replied, that he him&s;elf was no judge
of Perkin's preten&s;ions, but having received him as a
&s;upplicant, and promi&s;ed him protection, he was deter|mined
not to betray a man, whatever he was, who had
tru&s;ted to his good faith and his genero&s;ity. The next
demand of the Engli&s;h met with no better reception:
They required reparation for the ravages committed by
the late inroads into England: The Scots commi&s;&s;ioners
replied, that the &s;poils were like water &s;pilt upon the
ground, which could never be recovered, and that Hen|ry's
&s;ubjects were better able to bear the lo&s;s, than their
ma&s;ter's to repair it. Henry's commi&s;&s;ioners next pro|po&s;ed,
that the two Kings &s;hould have an interview at
Newca&s;tle, in order to adju&s;t all differences; but James
&s;aid, that he meant to treat of a peace, not to go a beg|ging
for it. Le&s;t the conferences &s;hould break off al|together
without effect, a truce was concluded for &s;ome
months;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Truce with Scot|land.</NOTE> and James perceiving, that while Perkin remained in Scotland, he never &s;hould enjoy a &s;olid peace
with Henry, privately de&s;ired him to depart the king|dom.</P>
<P>ACCESS was now barred Perkin into the Low Coun|tries;
his u&s;ual retreat in all his di&s;appointments. The
Flemi&s;h merchants, who felt &s;everely the lo&s;s re&s;ulting
<PB N="398" REF="420">
from their want of commerce with England, had made
&s;uch intere&s;t in the arch-duke's council, that commi&s;|&s;ioners
were &s;ent to London, in order to treat of an ac|commodation.
The Flemi&s;h court agreed that all Eng|li&s;h
rebels &s;hould be excluded the Low Countries; and in
this prohibition the deme&s;nes of the dutche&s;s-dowager
were expre&s;ly comprehended. When this principal ar|ticle
was agreed to, all the other terms were ea&s;ily ad|ju&s;ted.
A treaty of commerce was fini&s;hed, which was
favourable to the Flemings, and to which they gave long
the appellation of <HI>Intercur&s;us magnus,</HI> the great treaty.
And when the Engli&s;h merchants returned to their u&s;ual
abode at Antwerp, they were publicly received, as in
proce&s;&s;ion, with great joy and fe&s;tivity.</P>
<P>PERKIN was a Fleming by de&s;cent, tho' born in
England; and it might therefore be doubted, whether he
was comprehended in the treaty between the two na|tions:
But as he mu&s;t di&s;mi&s;s all his Engli&s;h retainers if
he took &s;helter in the Low Countries, and as he was
&s;ure of a cold reception, if not bad u&s;age, among a
people who were determined to keep on terms of friend|&s;hip
with the court of England; he thought fit rather
to hide him&s;elf, during &s;ome time, in the wilds and fa&s;t|ne&s;&s;es
of Ireland. Impatient however of a retreat, which
was both di&s;agreeable and dangerous, he held con&s;ulta|tions
with his followers, Herne, Skelton, and A&s;tley,
three broken trade&s;men; and by their advice, he re&s;olved
to try the affections of the Corni&s;h, who&s;e mutinous di&s;|po&s;ition,
notwith&s;tanding the King's lenity, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted,
after the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of their rebellion. No &s;ooner did he
appear at Bodmin in Cornwal, than the populace, to the
number of three thou&s;and men, &s;tocked to his &s;tandard;
and Perkin, elated with this appearance of &s;ucce&s;s, took
on him, for the fir&s;t time, the appellation of Richard
the fourth, King of England. Not to &s;uffer the ex|pectations
<PB N="399" REF="421">
of his followers to langui&s;h, he pre&s;ented
him&s;elf before Exeter; and by many fair promi&s;es, in|vited
that city to join his cau&s;e. Finding that the in|habitants
&s;hut their gates again&s;t him, he laid &s;iege to
the place; but being unprovided of artillery, ammuni|tion,
and of every thing requi&s;ite for that attempt, he
made no progre&s;s in his undertaking. Me&s;&s;engers were
&s;ent to the King, informing him of this in&s;urrection
and the citizens of Exeter meanwhile were determined to
hold out to the la&s;t extremity, in expectation of receiving
&s;uccour from the known vigilance of that monarch.</P>
<P>WHEN Henry was informed, that Perkin was landed
in England, he expre&s;&s;ed great joy, and prepared him|&s;elf
with alacrity to attack him, in hopes of being able,
at la&s;t, to put a period to a preten&s;ion, which had &s;o
long given him vexation and inquietude. All the cour|tiers,
&s;en&s;ible that their activity on this occa&s;ion would
be the mo&s;t acceptable &s;ervice which they could render
the King, prepared them&s;elves for the enterprize, and
forwarded his preparations. The lords Daubeney, and
Broke, with Sir Rice ap Thomas, ha&s;tened forward
with a &s;mall body of troops to the relief of Exeter.
The earl of Devon&s;hire, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
gentlemen in the county of that name, took arms of
their own accord, and marched to join the King's ge|nerals.
The duke of Buckingham put him&s;elf at the
head of a troop of young nobility and gentry, who &s;erved
as voluntiers, and who longed for an opportunity of
di&s;playing their courage and their loyalty. The King
him&s;elf prepared to follow with a con&s;iderable army;
and thus all England &s;eemed united again&s;t a pretender,
who had at fir&s;t engaged their attention and divided their
affections.</P>
<P>PERKIN, informed of the&s;e great preparations, imme|diately
broke up the &s;iege of Exeter, and retired to
<PB N="400" REF="422">
Taunton. Tho' his followers now amounted to the
number of near &s;even thou&s;and men, and &s;eemed &s;till
re&s;olute to defend his cau&s;e, he him&s;elf de&s;paired of
&s;ucce&s;s, and &s;ecretly withdrew to the &s;anctuary of Beau|lieu
in the new fore&s;t. The Corni&s;h rebels &s;ubmitted
them&s;elves to the King's mercy, and found that it was
not yet exhau&s;ted in their behalf. Except a few per&s;ons
of de&s;perate fortunes, who were executed, and &s;ome
others who were &s;everely fined, all the re&s;t were di&s;mi&s;t
with impunity. The Lady Catherine Gordon, wife to
Perkin, fell into the conqueror's hands, and was treated
with a genero&s;ity, which does him honour. He &s;oothed
her mind with many tokens of regard, placed her in a
reputable &s;tation about the Queen, and a&s;&s;igned her a
pen&s;ion, which &s;he enjoyed even under his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>HENRY next deliberated what cour&s;e to take with
Perkin him&s;elf. Some coun&s;elled him to make the pri|vileges
of the church yield to rea&s;ons of &s;tate, to take him
by violence from the &s;anctuary, to inflict on him the pu|ni&s;hment
due to his temerity, and thus at once to put an
end to an impo&s;ture which had long di&s;turbed the go|vernment,
and which the credulity of the people and
the artifices of malecontents were &s;till capable of reviving.
But the King deemed not the matter of &s;uch importance
as to merit &s;o, violent a remedy. He employed &s;ome per|&s;ons
to deal with Perkin, and per&s;uade him, under pro|mi&s;e
of pardon, to deliver him&s;elf into the King's hands<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, p. 606.</NOTE>.
The King conducted him in a &s;pecies of mock triumph
to London.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perkin taken pri|&s;oner.</NOTE> As Perkin pa&s;&s;ed along the road, and
through the &s;treets of that city, men of all ranks &s;tocked
about him, and the populace treated with the highe&s;t de|ri$ion
his fallen fortunes. They &s;eemed de&s;irous of re|venging
them&s;elves by their in&s;ults for the &s;hame which
<PB N="401" REF="423">
their former belief of his impo&s;tures had thrown upon
them. Tho' the eyes of the nation were generally
opened with regard to Perkin's real parentage and &s;tation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1498.</NOTE>
Henry thought proper to require of him a confe&s;&s;ion of
his life and adventures; and he ordered the account of
the whole to be publi&s;hed &s;oon after for the &s;atisfaction of
the public. But as his regard to decency made him &s;up|pre&s;s
entirely the &s;hare which the dutche&s;s of Burgundy
had had in contriving and conducting the impo&s;ture, the
people, who knew that &s;he had been the chief in&s;trument
in the whole affair, were inclined, on account of the
&s;ilence on that head, to pay the le&s;s credit to the authen|ticity
of the narrative.</P>
<P>BUT Perkin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1499.</NOTE> tho' his life was granted him, was &s;till
detained in cu&s;tody; and keepers were appointed to guard
him. Impatient of confinement, he broke loo&s;e from
his keepers, and flying to the fanctuary of Shyne, put
him&s;elf into the hands of the prior of that mona&s;tery.
The prior had obtained great credit by his character of
&s;anctity; and he prevailed with the King again to grant
a pardon to Perkin. But in order to reduce him to &s;till
greater contempt, he was &s;et in the &s;tocks at We&s;t|min&s;ter
and Cheap&s;ide, and obliged in both places to
read aloud to the people the confe&s;&s;ion which had been
formerly publi&s;hed in his name. He was then thrown into
the Tower, where his habits of re&s;tle&s;s intrigue and enter|prize
&s;till followed him. He in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the
intimacy of four &s;ervants of Sir John Digby, lieutenant
of the Tower; and by their means, opened a corre|&s;pondence
with the earl of Warwic, who was confined
to the &s;ame pri&s;on. That unfortunate prince, who had
from his earlie&s;t infancy been &s;hut up from the commerce
of men, and who was ignorant even of the mo&s;t com|mon
affairs of life, had fallen into a &s;implicity which
<PB N="402" REF="424">
made him &s;u&s;ceptible of any impre&s;&s;ions. The continued
dread al&s;o of the more violent effects of Henry's tyranny,
joined to the natural love of liberty, engaged him to em|brace
a project for his e&s;cape, by the murder of the lieu|tenant;
and Perkin offered to conduct the whole enter|prize.
The con&s;piracy e&s;caped not the King's vigilance:
It was even very generally believed, that the &s;cheme was
laid by him&s;elf, in order to draw Perkin and Warwic
into the &s;nare: But the &s;ub&s;equent execution of two of
Digby's &s;ervants for the contrivance, &s;eems to clear the
King of that imputation, which was indeed founded
more on the general idea entertained of his character,
than on any po&s;itive evidence.</P>
<P>PERKIN, by this new attempt, after &s;o many enormi|ties,
had rendered him&s;elf totally unworthy of mercy;
and he was accordingly arraigned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perkin executed.</NOTE> condemned, and &s;oon
after hanged at Tyburn, per&s;i&s;ting &s;till in the confe&s;&s;ion
of his impo&s;ture<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Stowe, Baker, Speed, Biondi, Holling&s;hed, Bacon. Some late writers have been &s;o whim&s;ical as to doubt, whether Perkin was an im|po&s;tor, and even to a&s;&s;ert him to be the real Richard Plantagenet, duke of York. But to refute this fancy, we need but reflect on the few fol|lowing particulars. 1. Had not the Queen-mother, and the other heads of the York party, been fully a&s;&s;ured of the death of both the young princes, would they have agreed to call over the earl of Rich|mond, the head of the Lanca&s;trian party, and marry him to the prince&s;s Elizabeth? 2. The &s;tory told con&s;tantly by Perkin of his e&s;cape is ut|terly incredible, that tho&s;e who were &s;ent to murder his brother took pity on him, and granted him his liberty. 3. What became of him during the cour&s;e of &s;even years, from his &s;uppo&s;ed death till his appear|ance in Ireland in 1491? Why was not the Queen-mother, the dutche&s;s of Bur|gundy, and the other friends of the family applied to, during that time, for his &s;upport and education? 4. Tho' the dutche&s;s of Burgundy at la&s;t acknowledged him for her nephew, &s;he had lo&s;t all pre|tence to authority by her former acknowledgment and &s;upport of Lam|bert Sim$el, an avowed impo&s;tor. It is remarkable, that Mr. Carte, in order to pre&s;erve the weight of the dutche&s;s's te&s;timony, in favour of Parkin, &s;upre&s;&s;es entirely this material fact. A remarkable effect of party prejudices, and the author's de&s;ire of blackening Henry the Seventh, who&s;e hereditary title to the crown was defective. 5. Pefkin him&s;elf con|fe&s;&s;ed his impo&s;ture more than once, and read his confe&s;&s;ion before the whole people. It is pretended that this confe&s;&s;ion was drawn from him by torture; but no ancient hi&s;torian gives any ground for this &s;urmi&s;e. 6. He renewed his confe&s;&s;ion at the foot of the gibbet on which he was executed. 7. After Henry the Eighth's acce&s;&s;ion the titles of the hou&s;e of York and Lanca&s;ter were fully confounded, and there was no longer any nece&s;&s;ity for defending Henry the Seventh and his title; yet all the hi&s;torians of that time, when the events were recent, &s;ome of the&s;e hi&s;torians too, &s;uch as Sir Thomas More, of the highe&s;t authority, agree in treating Perkin as an impo&s;tor.</NOTE>. It happened about that very time,
<PB N="403" REF="425">
that one Wilford, a cordwainer's &s;on, encouraged by
the &s;urpri&s;ing credit which had been given to other im|po&s;tures,
had undertaken to per&s;onate the earl of War|wic;
and a prie&s;t had even ventured from the pulpit to
recommend his cau&s;e to the people, who &s;eemed &s;till to
retain a propen&s;ity to adopt it. This incident &s;erved
Henry as an apology for his &s;everity towards that unfor|tunate
prince. He was brought to trial, and accu&s;ed,
not of contriving his e&s;cape, (for as he was committed
for no crime, the de&s;ire of liberty mu&s;t have been regar|ded
as natural and innocent) but of forming de&s;igns to
di&s;turb the government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The earl of Warwic executed. 21&s;t of November.</NOTE> and rai&s;e an in&s;urrection among
the people. Warwic confe&s;&s;ed the indictment, was con|demned,
and the &s;entence was executed upon him.</P>
<P>THIS violent tyranny, the great &s;tain of Henry's
reign, by which he de&s;troyed the la&s;t remaining male
of the line of Plantagenet, begot great di&s;content among
the people, who &s;aw an unhappy prince, that had long
been denied all the privileges of his high birth, even
cut off from the common benefits of nature, now at la&s;t
deprived of life it&s;elf, merely for re&s;i&s;ting that oppre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="404" REF="426">
under which he laboured. In vain did Henry endea|vour
to alleviate the odium of this guilt, by &s;haring it
with his ally, Ferdinand of Arragon, who, he &s;aid,
had &s;crupled to give his daughter Catherine in marriage
to Arthur, while any prince of the hou&s;e of York re|mained
alive. Men, on the contrary, felt higher indig|nation
at &s;eeing a young prince &s;acrificed, not to law
and ju&s;tice, but to the jealous politics of two &s;ubtile and
crafty tyrants.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the&s;e di&s;contents fe&s;tered in the minds
of men, they were &s;o checked by Henry's watchful po|licy
and &s;teady &s;everity, that they &s;eemed not to weaken
his government; and foreign princes, deeming his throne
now entirely &s;ecure, paid him rather the greater court|ship
and attention. The archduke Philip, in particular,
de&s;ired an interview with the King; and this monarch,
who had pa&s;&s;ed over to Calais, agreed to meet him at
St. Peter's church near that city. The archduke, on his
approaching the King, made ha&s;te to alight, and offered
to hold Henry's &s;tirrup; a mark of conde&s;cen&s;ion, which
that prince would not admit of. He called the King
<HI>father, patron, protector;</HI> and by his whole behaviour
expre&s;&s;ed a &s;trong de&s;ire of conciliating the friend&s;hip of
England. The duke of Orleans had &s;ucceeded to the
kingdom of France under the appellation of Lewis the
Twelfth; and having carried his arms into Italy, and
&s;ubdued the dutchy of Milan, his progre&s;s begot jealou&s;y
in Maximilian, Philip's father, as well as in Ferdinand,
his father-in-law. By the council, therefore, of the&s;e
monarchs, the young prince endeavoured by every art
to acquire the amity of Henry, whom they regarded as
the chief counterpoize to the greatne&s;s of France. No
particular plan however of alliance &s;eems to have been
concerted between the&s;e two princes in their interview:
<PB N="405" REF="427">
All pa&s;&s;ed in general profe&s;&s;ions of affection and regard;
at lea&s;t, in remote projects of a clo&s;er union, by the fu|ture
intermarriages of their children, who were then in
a &s;tate of infancy.</P>
<P>THE pope too,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1500.</NOTE> Alexander the Sixth, neglected not
the friend&s;hip of a monarch, who&s;e reputation was &s;pread
over all Europe. He &s;ent a nuntio to England, who ex|horted
the King to take part in the great alliance pro|jected
for the recovery of the Holy Land, and to lead in
per&s;on his forces again&s;t the Turk. The general frenzy
for cru&s;ades was now entirely exhau&s;ted in Europe; but
it was &s;till thought a nece&s;&s;ary piece of decency to pre|tend
zeal for tho&s;e pious enterprizes. Henry regretted
the di&s;tance of his &s;ituation, which rendered it incon|venient
for him to expo&s;e his per&s;on in defence of the
Chri&s;tian cau&s;e. He promi&s;ed, however, his utmo&s;t
a&s;&s;i&s;tance by aids and contributions; and rather than
the pope &s;hould go alone to the holy wars, unaccompanied
by any monarch, he even promi&s;ed to overlook all
other con&s;iderations, and to attend him in per&s;on. He
only required as a nece&s;&s;ary condition, that all differences
&s;hould be previou&s;ly compo&s;ed among Chri&s;tian princes,
and that &s;ome &s;ea-port towns in Italy &s;hould be put into
his hands for his retreat and &s;ecurity. It was ea&s;y to
conclude from this an&s;wer, that Henry had determined
with him&s;elf not to intermeddle in any wars again&s;t the
Turk: But as a great name, without any real a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
is &s;ometimes of &s;ervice, the knights of Rhodes, who were
at that time e&s;teemed the bulwark of Chri&s;tendom, cho&s;e
the King protector of their order.</P>
<P>BUT the prince, who&s;e alliance Henry valued the
mo&s;t, was that of Ferdinand of Arragon, who&s;e vigorous
and &s;teady policy, always attended with &s;ucce&s;s, had
<PB N="406" REF="428">
rendered him in many re&s;pects, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
monarch in Europe. There was al&s;o a remarkable &s;imi|larity
of character between the&s;e two princes: Both
were full of craft, intrigue, and de&s;ign; and tho' a
re&s;emblance of this nature be a &s;lender foundation of
confidence and friend&s;hip, where the intere&s;ts of the par|ties
in the lea&s;t interfere; yet &s;uch was the &s;ituation of
Henry and Ferdinand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1501.</NOTE> that no jealou&s;y ever on any oc|ca&s;ion
aro&s;e between them. The King had now the
&s;atisfaction of compleating a marriage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of prince Arthur with Ca|therine of Arragon. 12th of No|vember.</NOTE> which had been
projected and negotiated during the cour&s;e of &s;even years,
between Arthur prince of Wales and the infanta Ca|therine,
fourth daughter of Ferdinand and I&s;abella; he
near &s;ixteen years of age, &s;he eighteen. But this mar|riage
proved in the i&s;&s;ue unpro&s;perous. The young
prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of A|pril. His death.</NOTE> a few months after, &s;ickened and died, very
much regreted by the whole nation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1502.</NOTE> Henry, de&s;irous
to continue his alliance with Spain, and al&s;o unwilling
to re&s;tore Catherine's dowry, which was two hundred
thou&s;and ducats, obliged his &s;econd &s;on, Henry, whom
he created prince of Wales, to be contracted to the
prince&s;s. The prince made all the oppo&s;ition which a
youth of twelve years of age was capable of; but as the
King per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution, the e&s;pou&s;als were at
la&s;t, by means of the pope's di&s;pen&s;ation, concluded be|tween
the parties: An event, which was afterwards at|tended
with the mo&s;t important con&s;equences.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame year, another marriage was concluded,
which was al&s;o,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the prince&s;s Margaret with the King of Scotland.</NOTE> in the next age, productive of great
events; The marriage of Margaret, the King's elde&s;t
daughter, with James King of Scotland. This alliance
had been negotiated during three years, tho' interrupted
by &s;everal broils; and Henry hoped, from the comple|tion
of it, to remove all &s;ource of di&s;cord with that
<PB N="407" REF="429">
neighbouring kingdom, by who&s;e animo&s;ity England
had been &s;o often infe&s;ted. When this marriage was
deliberated on in the Engli&s;h council, &s;ome objected,
that England might, by means of that alliance, fall un|der
the dominion of Scotland. &startq;No;&endq; replied Henry,
&startq;Scotland, in that event, would only become an ac|ce&s;&s;ion
to England.&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1503.</NOTE> Amid&s;t the&s;e pro&s;perous events,
the King met with a dome&s;tic calamity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of Fe|bruary.</NOTE> which made not
&s;uch impre&s;&s;ion on him as it merited. His queen died
in child-bed; and the infant lived not long after. This
prince&s;s was de&s;ervedly a great favourite of the nation;
and the general affection for her encrea&s;ed, on account
of the har&s;h treatment, which, it was thought, &s;he met
with from her con&s;ort.</P>
<P>THE &s;ituation of the King's affairs, both at home
and abroad, was now, in every re&s;pect, very fortunate.
All the efforts of the European princes, both in war
and negotiation, were turned to the &s;ide of Italy; and
the various events, which there aro&s;e, made Henry's
alliance be courted by every party, and yet intere&s;ted
him &s;o little as never to touch him with concern or
anxiety. His clo&s;e connexions with Spain and Scotland
en&s;ured his tranquillity; and his continued &s;ucce&s;&s;es
over dome&s;tic enemies, owing to the prudence and vi|gour
of his conduct, had reduced the people to entire
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience. Henry therefore, uncontroul|ed
by apprehen&s;ion or oppo&s;ition of any kind, gave full
&s;cope to his natural propen&s;ity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oppre&s;|&s;ions of the people.</NOTE> and avarice, which had
ever been his predominant pa&s;&s;ion, being encrea&s;ed by
age, and encouraged by ab&s;olute authority, broke all
re&s;traints of &s;hame or ju&s;tice. He had found two mini|&s;ters,
Emp&s;on and Dudley, perfectly qualified to &s;econd
his rapacious and tyrannical inclinations, and to prey
upon his defencele&s;s people. The&s;e in&s;truments of oppre&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="408" REF="430">
were both lawyers, the fir&s;t of mean birth, of bru|tal
manners, of an unrelenting temper; the &s;econd bet|ter
born, better educated, and better bred, but equally
unju&s;t, &s;evere, and inflexible. By their knowledge in
the law, the&s;e men were qualified to pervert the forms
of ju&s;tice to the oppre&s;&s;ion of the innocent; and the
formidable authority of the King &s;upported them in all
their iniquities.</P>
<P>IT was their u&s;ual practice at fir&s;t to ob&s;erve &s;o far
the appearance of law as to give indictments to tho&s;e
whom they intended to oppre&s;s: Upon which the per|&s;ons
were committed to pri&s;on, but never brought to
trial; and were at la&s;t obliged to recover their liberty,
by paying heavy fines and ran&s;oms, which were called
mitigations and compo&s;itions. By degrees, the very ap|pearance
of law was neglected: They &s;ent forth their
precepts to attach men, and &s;ummon them before them|&s;elves
and &s;ome others, at their private hou&s;es, in a court
of commi&s;&s;ion, where, in a &s;ummary manner, without
trial or jury, arbitrary decrees were i&s;&s;ued, both in pleas
of the crown and controver&s;ies between private parties.
Juries them&s;elves, when &s;ummoned, proved but &s;mall
&s;ecurity to the &s;ubject; being brow-beat by the&s;e oppre&s;|&s;ors;
nay, fined, impri&s;oned, and puni&s;hed, if they g$ve
&s;entence again&s;t the inclination of the mini&s;ters. The
whole &s;y&s;tem of the feudal law, which &s;till prevailed,
was turned into a &s;cheme of oppre&s;&s;ion. Even the
King's wards, after they came to full age, were not
&s;uffered to enter in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their lands without pay|ing
exorbitant fines. Men were al&s;o hara&s;&s;ed with in|formations
of intru&s;ion upon &s;carce colourable titles.
When an outlawry in a per&s;onal action was i&s;&s;ued again&s;t
any man, he was not allowed to purcha&s;e his charter of
<PB N="409" REF="431">
pardon, except on the payment of a great &s;um; and if
he refu&s;ed the compo&s;ition required of him, the &s;trict
law, which, in &s;uch ca&s;es, allows forfeiture of goods,
was rigorou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on. Nay, without any colour of
law, the half of men's lands and rents were &s;eized during
two years, as a penalty in ca&s;e of outlawry. But the
chief in&s;truments of oppre&s;&s;ion, employed by the&s;e mi|ni&s;ters,
were the penal &s;tatutes, which, without con&s;i|deration
of rank, quality, or &s;ervices, were rigidly put
in execution again&s;t all men: Spies, informers, and
inqui&s;itors were rewarded and encouraged in every cor|ner
of the kingdom: And no difference was made whe|ther
the &s;tatute was beneficial or hurtful, recent or ob|&s;olete,
po&s;&s;ible or impo&s;&s;ible to be executed. The &s;ole
end of the King and his mini&s;ters was to ama&s;s money,
and bring every one under the la&s;h of their authority<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Bacon, 629, 630. Holling&s;hed, p. 504. Polyd. Virg. p. 613. 615.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THRO' the prevalence of &s;uch an arbitrary and iniqui|tous
admini&s;tration, the Engli&s;h, it may &s;afely be af|firmed,
were con&s;iderable lo&s;ers by the ancient privilege,
which &s;ecured them from all taxations and impo&s;itions,
except &s;uch as were levied by their own con&s;ent. Had
the King been empowered to lay on general taxes at
plea&s;ure, he would naturally have ab&s;tained from the&s;e
oppre&s;&s;ive expedients, which de&s;troyed all &s;ecurity in
private property, and begot an univer&s;al diffidence thro'
the nation. In vain did the people look for pro|tection
from the parliament, which was pretty frequent|ly
&s;ummoned during this reign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1504.</NOTE> That a&s;&s;embly was &s;o
overawed, that, at this very time, during the greate&s;t
rage of Henry's oppre&s;&s;ions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th Jan. A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> the commons cho&s;e Dudley
their &s;peaker, the very man who was the chief in&s;tru|ment
<PB N="410" REF="432">
of his oppre&s;&s;ions. And tho' the King was known
to be immen&s;ely opulent, and had no pretence of
wars or expen&s;ive enterprizes of any kind, they grant|ed
him the &s;ub&s;idy, which he demanded. But &s;o in&s;a|tiable
was his avarice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1505.</NOTE> that next year he levied a new
benevolence, and renewed that arbitrary and oppre&s;&s;ive
method of taxation. By all the&s;e arts of accumulation,
joined to a rigid frugality in his expence, he &s;o filled his
coffers, that he is &s;aid to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in ready money
the &s;um of 1,800,000 pounds: An incredible trea&s;ure,
if we con&s;ider the &s;carcity of money in tho&s;e days<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Silver was during this reign at 37 &s;hillings and &s;ixpence a pound, which makes Henry's trea&s;ure above 2,750,000 pounds &s;terling. Be|&s;ides, many commodities have become thrice as dear by the encrea&s;e of gold and &s;ilver in Europe. And what is a circum&s;tance of &s;till greater weight, all other &s;tates were then very poor, in compari&s;on of what they are at pre&s;ent: The&s;e circum&s;tances make Henry's trea&s;ure appeal very great; and may lead us to conceive the oppre&s;&s;ions of his govern|ment.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT while Henry was enriching him&s;elf with the
&s;poils of his oppre&s;&s;ed people, there happened an event
abroad, which engaged his attention, and was even the
object of his anxiety and concern. I&s;abella, queen of
Ca&s;tile, died about this time; and it was fore&s;een, that
by this incident the fortunes of Ferdinand, her hu&s;band,
would be much affected. The King was not only at|tentive
to the fate of his ally, and watchful le&s;t the ge|neral
&s;y&s;tem of Europe &s;hould be affected by &s;o impor|tant
an event: He al&s;o con&s;idered the &s;imilarity of his
own &s;ituation with that of Ferdinand, and regarded the
i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e tran&s;actions as a precedent for him&s;elf.
Joan, the daughter of Ferdinand by I&s;abella, was mar|ried
to the archduke Philip, and being, in right of her
mother, heire&s;s of Ca&s;tile, &s;eemed entitled to di&s;pute
with Ferdinand the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration of that king|dom.
<PB N="411" REF="433">
Henry knew, that, notwith&s;tanding his own pre|ten&s;ions
by the hou&s;e of Lanca&s;ter, the greate&s;t part of
the nation were convinced of the &s;uperiority of his wife's
title; and he dreaded le&s;t the prince, who was daily ad|vancing
towards manhood, might be tempted by ambi|tion
to lay immediate claim to the throne. By his per|petual
attention to depre&s;s the partizans of the York
family, he had more clo&s;ely united them into one party,
and encrea&s;ed their de&s;ire of &s;haking off that yoke, under
which they had &s;o long laboured, and of taking every
advantage, which his oppre&s;&s;ive government &s;hould give
his enemies again&s;t him. And as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no inde|pendent
force like Ferdinand, and governed a kingdom
more turbulent and unruly, which he him&s;elf, by his
narrow politics, had confirmed in factious prejudices;
he apprehended that his &s;ituation would prove in the
i&s;&s;ue &s;till more precarious.</P>
<P>NOTHING could turn out more contrary to the King's
inclinations than the tran&s;actions in Spain. Ferdinand
had become very unpopular in Ca&s;tile, chiefly by rea&s;on
of his former exactions and impo&s;itions; and the &s;tates
of the kingdom di&s;covered an evident re&s;olution of pre|ferring
the title of Philip and Joan.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1506.</NOTE> In order to take
advantage of the&s;e favourable di&s;po&s;itions, the archduke,
now King of Ca&s;tile, attended by his con&s;ort, embarked
for Spain during the winter &s;ea&s;on; and meeting with a
violent tempe&s;t in the channel, was obliged to take &s;hel|ter
in the harbour of Weymouth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A rival of the King of Ca&s;tile.</NOTE> Sir John Trenchard,
a gentleman of authority in the county of Dor&s;et, hear|ing
of a fleet upon the coa&s;t, had a&s;&s;embled &s;ome forces;
and being joined by Sir John Cary, who was al&s;o at the
head of an armed body, he came to that town. Finding,
that Philip, in order to relieve his &s;ickne&s;s and fatigue,
was already come a&s;hore, he invited him to his hou&s;e;
<PB N="412" REF="434">
and immediately di&s;patched an expre&s;s to inform the
court of this important incident. The King &s;ent in all
ha&s;te the earl of Arundel to compliment the archduke
on his arrival in England, and to inform him, that he
intended to pay him a vi&s;it in per&s;on, and to give him
a &s;uitable reception in his kingdom. Philip knew,
that he could not now depart without the King's con&s;ent;
and therefore, for the &s;ake of di&s;patch, he re&s;olved to
anticipate his vi&s;it, and to have an interview with him
at Wind&s;or. Henry received him with all the magni|ficence
po&s;&s;ible, and with all the &s;eeming cordiality;
but he re&s;olved, notwith&s;tanding, to extract &s;ome advan|tage
from this involuntary vi&s;it, payed him by his royal
gue&s;t.</P>
<P>EDMOND de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, nephew to Ed|ward
the fourth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues of the earl of Suffolk.</NOTE> and brother to the earl of Lincoln,
&s;lain at the battle of Stoke, had &s;ome years before killed
a man in a &s;udden fit of pa&s;&s;ion, and had been obliged
to apply to the King for a remi&s;&s;ion of his crime. The
King had granted his reque&s;t; but being little indulgent
to all per&s;ons connected with the hou&s;e of York, he
obliged him to appear openly in court and plead his par|don.
Suffolk more re&s;enting the affront, than grateful
for the favour, had fled into Flanders, and taken &s;helter
with his aunt, the dutche&s;s of Burgundy: But being
promi&s;ed forgivene&s;s by the King, he returned into Eng|land,
and obtained a new pardon. Actuated, however,
by the natural inquietude of his temper, and unea&s;y from
debts which he had contracted by his expences at prince
Arthur's marriage, he again made an elopement into
Flanders. The King, well acquainted with the general
di&s;content which prevailed again&s;t his admini&s;tration, ne|glected
not this incident, which might become of im|portance;
and he employed his u&s;ual artifices to elude
<PB N="413" REF="435">
the efforts of his enemies. He directed Sir Robert Cur|&s;on,
governor of the ca&s;tle of Hammes, to fly from his
charge, and to infinuate him&s;elf into the confidence of
Suffolk, by making him a tender of his &s;ervices. Upon
information &s;ecretly conveyed by Cur&s;on, the King &s;eized
William Courtney, earl of Devon&s;hire, his brother in
law, married to the lady Catherine, daughter of Edward
the fourth; William de la Pole, brother to the earl of
Suffolk; Sir James Tirrel, and Sir James Windham,
with &s;ome per&s;ons of inferior quality; and he committed
them all to cu&s;tody. The lord Abergavenny and Sir
Thomas Green were al&s;o apprehended; but were &s;oon
after freed from their confinement. William de la Pole
was detained in pri&s;on during a long time: And the earl
of Devon&s;hire recovered not his freedom during the
King's life. But Henry's chief &s;everity fell upon Sir
James Windham, and Sir James Tirrel, who were both
brought to their trial, condemned, and executed: The
fate of the latter gave univer&s;al &s;atisfaction, on account
of his participation in the murder of the young princes,
&s;ons to Edward the fourth. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;|coveries
and executions, Cur&s;on was &s;till able to main|tain
his credit with the earl of Suffolk; and Henry, in
order to remove all &s;u&s;picious, had ordered him to be ex|communicated,
together with Suffolk him&s;elf, for his
pretended rebellion. But after that traitor had performed
all the &s;ervices expected from him, he &s;uddenly de&s;erted
the earl, and came over to England, where the King
received him with unu&s;ual marks of favour and confi|dence.
Suffolk, a&s;toni&s;hed at this in&s;tance of perfidy,
finding that even the dutche&s;s of Burgundy, tired with
&s;o many fruitle&s;s attempts, had become indifferent to his
cau&s;e, fled &s;ecretly into France, thence into Germany, and
returned at la&s;t into the Low Countries; where he
<PB N="414" REF="436">
was protected, tho' not countenanced, by the archduke
Philip, then in clo&s;e alliance with the King.</P>
<P>HENRY neglected not the pre&s;ent opportunity of com|plaining
to Philip of the reception, which Suffolk had
met with in his dominions. &startq;I really thought,&endq; re|plied
the King of Ca&s;tile, &startq;that your greatne&s;s and
felicity had &s;et you far above apprehen&s;ions from any

I &s;hall bani&s;h him my &s;tate.&endq; &startq;I expect,
that you will carry your complai&s;ance farther,&endq; &s;aid
the King: &startq;I de&s;ire to have Suffolk put into my hands,

obedience.&endq; &startq;That mea&s;ure,&endq; &s;aid Philip, &startq;will
reflect di&s;honour upon you as well as my&s;elf. You
will be thought to have u&s;ed me as a pri&s;oner.&endq; &startq;Then
the matter is at an end,&endq; replied the King, &startq;for I
will take that di&s;honour upon me; and &s;o your ho|nour

under a nece&s;&s;ity of complying; but he fir&s;t exacted
Henry's promi&s;e that he would &s;pare Suffolk's life. That
nobleman was invited over to England by Philip; as if
the King would grant him a pardon, by the interce&s;&s;ion
of his friend and ally. Upon his appearance, he was
committed to the Tower; and the King of Ca&s;tile,
having fully &s;atisfied Henry, as well by this conce&s;&s;ion,
as by &s;igning a treaty of commerce between England and
Ca&s;tile, which was advantageous to the former king|dom<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiii. p. 142.</NOTE>,

the Ca&s;tilians, and put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne. He

<P>THE King &s;urvived the&s;e tran&s;actions two years; but

He entertained al&s;o &s;ome intention of marriage

all &s;uch thoughts; and he began to ca&s;t his eye towards
that future exi&s;tence, which the iniquities and &s;everities
of his reign rendered a very di&s;mal pro&s;pect to him. To
allay the terrors, under which he laboured, he endea|voured,
by di&s;tributing alms and founding religious
hou&s;es, to make atonement for his crimes, and to pur|cha&s;e,
by the &s;acrifice of part of his ill-gotten trea&s;ures,
a reconciliation with his offended Maker. Remor&s;e even

Emp&s;on and Dudley; but not &s;ufficient to make him
&s;top the rapacious hands of tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ors. Sir Wil|liam
Capel was again fined two thou&s;and pounds under
&s;ome frivolous pretences, and was committed to the
Tower for daring to murmur again&s;t that iniquity. Har|ris,
an alderman of London, was indicted, and died of
vexation before his trial came to an i&s;&s;ue. Sir Law|rence
Ailmer, who had been mayor, and his two &s;heriffs,

<P>THE reign of Henry the &s;eventh was, in the main,
fortunate for his people at home, and honourable abroad.
He put an end to the civil wars with which the nation
had been long harra&s;&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And cha|racter.</NOTE> he maintained peace and order
in the &s;tate, he depre&s;&s;ed the former exorbitant power of
the nobility, and, together with the friend&s;hip of &s;ome
foreign princes, he acquired the con&s;ideration and regard
of all. He loved peace without fearing war; tho' agi|tated
with continual &s;u&s;picions of his &s;ervants and mini|&s;ters,
he di&s;covered no timidity either in the conduct of
his affairs, or in the day of battle; and tho' often &s;evere
in his puni&s;hments, he was commonly le&s;s actuated by
revenge than by the maxims of policy. The &s;ervices,
which he rendered the people, were derived from his
views of private intere&s;t, rather than the motives of pub|lic
&s;pirit; and where he deviated from &s;elfi&s;h regards, it
was unknown to him&s;elf, and ever from the malignant
prejudices of faction, or the mean projects of avarice;
not from the &s;allies of pa&s;&s;ion, or allurements of plea|&s;ure;
&s;till le&s;s, from the benign motives of friend&s;hip and
genero&s;ity. His capacity was excellent, but &s;omewhat
contracted by the narrowne&s;s of his heart; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
in&s;inuation and addre&s;s, but never employed the&s;e talents,
except where &s;ome great point of intere&s;t was to be gain|ed;
and while he neglected to conciliate the affections of
his people, he often felt the danger of re&s;ting his autho|rity
on their fear and reverence alone. He was always
extremely attentive to his affairs. But po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not the
faculty of &s;eeing far into futurity; and was more expert
<PB N="417" REF="439">
at providing a remedy for his mi&s;takes than judicious in
avoiding them. Avarice was on the whole his ruling
pa&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">As a proof of Henry's attention to the &s;malle&s;t profits, Bacon tells us, that he had &s;een a book of accompts kept by Emp&s;on, and &s;ub|&s;cribed in almo&s;t every leaf by the King's own hand. Among other articles was the following. &startq;<HI>Item,</HI> Received of &s;uch a one $ive marks for a pardon, which, if it do not pa&s;s, the money to be repayed, or the party otherwi&s;e &s;atisfied.

of a man, placed in a high &s;tation, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of ta|lents
for great affairs, in whom that pa&s;&s;ion predominated
above ambition. Even among private per&s;ons, avarice
is commonly nothing but a &s;pecies of ambition, and is
chiefly incited by the pro&s;pect of that regard, di&s;tinction
and con&s;ideration which attend on riches.</P>
<P>THE power of the Kings of England had always been
&s;omewhat irregular or di&s;cretionary; but was &s;carce ever
&s;o ab&s;olute during any former reign, at lea&s;t after the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of the great charter, as during that of
Henry. Be&s;ides the per&s;onal character of the man, full
of vigour, indu&s;try, and &s;everity, deliberate in all pro|jects,
&s;teady in every purpo&s;e, and attended with cau|tion,
as well as good fortune, in each enterprize; he
came to the throne after long and bloody civil wars,
which had de&s;troyed all the great nobility, who alone
could re&s;i&s;t the encroachments of his authority: The
people were tired with di&s;cord and inte&s;tine convul&s;ions,
and willing to &s;ubmit to u&s;urpations, and even to inju|ries,
rather than plunge them&s;elves anew into like mi|&s;eries:
The fruitle&s;s efforts made again&s;t him &s;erved al|ways,
as is u&s;ual, to confirm his authority: As he ruled
by a faction, and the le&s;&s;er faction, all tho&s;e on whom
he conferred offices, &s;en&s;ible that they owed every thing
<PB N="418" REF="440">
to his protection, were content to &s;upport his power,
tho' at the expence of ju&s;tice and national privileges.
The&s;e &s;eem the chief cau&s;es which at this time be&s;towed
on the crown &s;o con&s;iderable an addition of prerogative,
and rendered the pre&s;ent reign a kind of epoch in the
Engli&s;h con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THIS prince, tho' he exalted his own prerogative
above law, is celebrated by his hi&s;torian for many good
laws, which he cau&s;ed to be enacted for the government
of his &s;ubjects. Several con&s;iderable regulations, indeed,
are found among the &s;tatutes of this reign, both with re|gard
to the police of the kingdom, and its commerce:
But the former are generally contrived with much better
judgment than the latter.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His laws.</NOTE> The more &s;imple ideas of order
and equity are &s;ufficient to guide a legi&s;lator in every thing
that regards the internal admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice: But
the principles of commerce are much more com|plicated,
and require long experience and deep reflection
to be well under&s;tood in any &s;tate. The real con&s;e|quence
of a law or practice is there often contrary to
fir&s;t appearances. No wonder, that during the reign of
Henry the &s;eventh, the&s;e matters were often mi&s;under|&s;tood;
and it may &s;afely be affirmed, that even in the
age of lord Bacon, very imperfect and erroneous ideas
were formed on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>EARLY in Henry's reign, the authority of the Star
Chamber, which was before founded on common law,
and very antient practice, was in &s;ome ca&s;es confirmed
by act of parliament<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rot. Parl. 3 H. 7. n. 17.</NOTE>: Lord Bacon extols the u&s;e of
this court; but men began, during the age of that hi&s;to|rian,
to feel that &s;o arbitrary a juri&s;diction was totally
incompatible with liberty; and in proportion as the &s;pirit
<PB N="419" REF="441">
of independance ro&s;e &s;till higher in the nation, the aver|&s;ion
again&s;t it increa&s;ed, till it was entirely aboli&s;hed by
act of parliament in the reign of Charles the fir&s;t, a little
before the commencement of the civil wars.</P>
<P>LAWS were pa&s;&s;ed in this reign, ordering the King's
&s;uit for murder to be carried on within a year and day<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 1.</NOTE>.
Formerly, it did not u&s;ually commence till after that
term; and as the friends of the per&s;on murdered, in the
interval often compounded matters with the criminal,
that crime very frequently pa&s;&s;ed unpuni&s;hed. Suits were
given to the poor <HI>in forma pauperis,</HI> as it is called: That
is, without paying dues for the writs, or any fees to the
council<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 12.</NOTE>: A good law at all times, e&s;pecially in that
age, when the people laboured under the oppre&s;&s;ion of
the great; but a law very difficult to be reduced to exe|cution.
A law was made again&s;t carrying off any wo|man
by force<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 2.</NOTE>. The benefit of clergy was abridged<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap. 13.</NOTE>,
and the criminal, on the fir&s;t offence, was ordered to
be burned in the hand with a letter marking his crime;
after which he was puni&s;hed capitally for any new of|fence.
This law was much too indulgent, yet was in
tho&s;e days regarded as a violation of the rights of the
church. Sheriffs were no longer allowed to fine any
per&s;on, without previou&s;ly &s;ummoning him before their
court<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 15.</NOTE>. It is &s;trange, that &s;uch a practice &s;hould ever
have prevailed. Attaint of juries was granted in ca&s;es
which exceeded forty pounds value<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 24. 19 H. 7. cap. 3.</NOTE>. A law which has
an appearance of equity, but which was afterwards
found inconvenient. Actions popular were not allowed
to be eluded by fraud or covin. If any &s;ervant of the
King con&s;pired again&s;t the life of the &s;teward, trea&s;urer,
<PB N="420" REF="442">
or comptroller of the King's hou&s;hold, this de&s;ign, tho'
not followed by any act, was made liable to the puni&s;h|ment
of felony<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 13.</NOTE>. This &s;tatute was procured by the
jealou&s;y of archbi&s;hop Morton, who found him&s;elf ex|po&s;ed
to the enmity of great numbers.</P>
<P>THERE &s;carce pa&s;&s;ed any &s;e&s;&s;ion during this reign
wit$$ut &s;ome &s;tatute again&s;t engaging retainers, and
giving them badges or liveries<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 1. &amp; 12. 11 H. 7. cap. 3. 19 H. 7. cap. 14.</NOTE>; a practice, by which
they were, in a manner, inli&s;ted under &s;ome great lord,
and were kept in readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in all wars, in|&s;urrections,
riots, violences, and even in bearing evi|dence
for him in courts of ju&s;tice<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 12. 11 H. 7. cap. 25.</NOTE>. This di&s;order,
which had ari&s;en during turbulent times, when the law
could give little protection to the &s;ubject, was then deeply
rooted in England; and it required all the vigilance and
rigour of Henry to extirpate it. There is a &s;tory of his
&s;everity again&s;t that abu&s;e; which &s;eems to merit prai&s;e,
tho' it is commonly cited as an in&s;tance of his avarice
and rapacity. The earl of Oxford, his favourite gene|ral,
in whom he always placed great and de&s;erved tru&s;t,
having &s;plendidly entertained him at his ca&s;tle of Hening|ham,
was de&s;irous of making a &s;how of his magnificence
at the departure of his royal gue&s;t; and ordered all his
retainers, with their liveries and badges, to be drawn up
in two lines, that their appearance might be more gallant
and &s;plendid. &startq;My lord,&endq; &s;aid the King, &startq;I have
heard much of your ho&s;pitality; but the truth far ex|ceeds
the report. The&s;e hand&s;ome gentlemen and
yeomen, whom I &s;ee on both &s;ides of me, are, no
doubt, your menial &s;ervants.&endq; The earl &s;miled, and
confe&s;&s;ed that his fortune was too narrow for &s;uch
<PB N="421" REF="443">
magnificence. &startq;They are mo&s;t of them,&endq; &s;ubjoined
he, &startq;my retainers, who are come to do me &s;ervice at
&s;uch a time, when they knew I was honoured with
your maje&s;ty's pre&s;ence.&endq; The King &s;tarted a little,
and &s;aid, &startq;By my faith, my lord, I thank you for my
good cheer, but I mu&s;t not allow my laws to be brok|en
in my &s;ight. My attorney mu&s;t &s;peak with you.&endq;
Oxford is &s;aid to have payed no le&s;s than fifteen thou|&s;and
marks, as a compo&s;ition for his offence.</P>
<P>THE encrea&s;e of the arts, more effectually than all
the &s;everities of laws, put an end to this pernicious
practice. The nobility, in&s;tead of vying with each
other, in the number and boldne&s;s of their retainers, ac|quired
by degrees a more civilized &s;pecies of emulation,
and endeavoured to excel in the &s;plendour and elegance
of their equipage, hou&s;es, and tables. The common
people, no longer maintained in a vicious idlene&s;s by
their &s;uperiors, were obliged to learn &s;ome calling or in|du&s;try,
and became u&s;eful both to them&s;elves and others.
And it mu&s;t be acknowledged, in &s;pite of tho&s;e who de|claim
&s;o violently again&s;t the refinement of the arts, or
what they are plea&s;ed to call luxury, that, as much as
an indu&s;trious trade&s;man is both a better man and a bet|ter
citizen than one of tho&s;e idle retainers, who formerly
depended on the great families; &s;o much is the life of a mo|dern
nobleman more laudable than that of an antient baron.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t important law in its con
equences, which was enacted during the reign of Henry, was that
by which the nobility and gentry acquired a power of
breaking the antient entails, and of alienating their
e&s;tates<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap. 24. The practice of breaking entails by means of a fine and recovery was introduced in the reign of Edward the 4th: But it was not, properly &s;peaking, law, till the &s;tatute of Henry the 7th; which, by correcting &s;ome abu&s;es that attended that practice, gave indi|rectly a &s;anction to it.</NOTE>. By means of this law, joined to the beginning
<PB N="422" REF="444">
luxury and refinements of the age, the great fortunes of
the barons were gradually di&s;&s;ipated, and the property of
the commons encrea&s;ed in England. It is probable, that
Henry fore&s;aw and intended this con&s;equence; becau&s;e
the con&s;tant &s;cheme of his policy con&s;i&s;ted in depre&s;&s;ing
the great, and exalting churchmen, lawyers, and men
of new families, who were more dependant on him.</P>
<P>THIS King's love of money naturally led him to en|courage
commerce, which encrea&s;ed his cu&s;toms; but, if
we may judge by mo&s;t of the laws enacted during his
reign, trade and indu&s;try were rather hurt than promoted
by the care and attention which were given to them.
Severe laws were made again&s;t taking intere&s;t for mo|ney,
which was then denominated u&s;ury<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 5.</NOTE>. Even the
profits of exchange were prohibited, as &s;avouring of
u&s;ury<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 6.</NOTE>, which the &s;uper&s;tition of that age zealou&s;ly pro|&s;cribed.
All eva&s;ive contracts, by which profits could be
made from the loan of money, were al&s;o carefully guarded
again&s;t<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">7 H. 7. cap. 8.</NOTE>. It is needle&s;s to ob&s;erve how unrea&s;onable
and iniquitous the&s;e laws, how impo&s;&s;ible to be executed,
and how hurtful to trade, if they could take place. We
may ob&s;erve, however, to the prai&s;e of this King, that
&s;ometimes, in order to promote commerce, he lent to
merchants &s;ums of money, without intere&s;t; when he
knew, that their &s;tock was not &s;ufficient for tho&s;e enter|prizes,
which they had in view<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Polyd. Virg.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LAWS were made again&s;t the exportation of money,
plate, or bullion<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap. 23.</NOTE>: A precaution, which &s;erves to no
<PB N="423" REF="445">
other purpo&s;e than to make more be exported. But &s;o
far was the anxiety on this head carried, that merchant
aliens, who imported commodities into the kingdom,
were obliged to inve&s;t, in Engli&s;h commodities, all the
money acquired by their &s;ales, in order to prevent their
conveying it away in a clande&s;tine manner<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HORSES were forbid to be exported; as if that ex|portation
did not encourage the breed, and render them
more plentiful in the kingdom<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 13.</NOTE>. To promote archery,
no bows were to be &s;old at a higher price than &s;ix &s;hil|lings
and four-pence<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">3 H. 7. cap. 12.</NOTE>, reducing money to the denomi|nation
of our time. The only effect of this regulation
mu&s;t be either that the people would be &s;upplied with bad
bows or none at all. Prices were al&s;o affixed to woollen
cloath<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap. 8.</NOTE>, to caps and hats<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid, cap. 9.</NOTE>: And labourers wages were
regulated by law<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">II H. 7. cap. 22.</NOTE>. It is evident, that the&s;e circum|&s;tances
ought always to be left free, and be tru&s;ted to the
common cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s and commerce. To &s;ome it
may appear &s;urprizing, that the price of a yard of &s;car|let
cloth &s;hould be limited to &s;ix and twenty &s;hillings, that
of a yard of coloured cloth to eighteen; higher prices
than the&s;e commodities bear at pre&s;ent: And that the
wages of a trade&s;man, &s;uch as a ma&s;on, bricklayer, tyler,
&amp;c. &s;hould be regulated at near ten-pence a day; which
is not much inferior to the pre&s;ent wages given in &s;ome
places of England. Labour and commodities have cer|tainly
ri&s;en very much &s;ince the di&s;covery of the We&s;t-Indies;
but not &s;o much in every particular as is general|ly
imagined. The greater indu&s;try of the pre&s;ent times
has encrea&s;ed the number of trade&s;men and labourers, &s;o
as to keep wages nearer a par than could be expected
<PB N="424" REF="446">
from the great encrea&s;e of gold and &s;ilver. And the ad|ditional
art employed in the finer manufactures, has
even made &s;ome of the&s;e commodities fall below their
former value. Not to mention, that merchants and
dealers, being contented with le&s;s profit than formerly,
afford the goods cheaper to their cu&s;tomers. It appears
by a &s;tatute of this reign<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap. 9.</NOTE>, that goods bought for &s;ix|teen
pence would &s;ometimes be &s;old by the merchants
for three &s;hillings. The commodities, who&s;e price has
chiefly ri&s;en, are butchers meat, fowl, and fi&s;h, (e&s;pe|cially
the latter) which cannot be much augmented in
quantity by the encrea&s;e of art and indu&s;try. The pro|fe&s;&s;ion
which then abounded mo&s;t, and was embraced by
per&s;ons of the lowe&s;t rank, was the church: By a clau&s;e
of a &s;tatute, all clerks or &s;tudents of the univer&s;ity were
forbid to beg, without a permi&s;&s;ion from the vice-chan|cellor<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ONE great cau&s;e of the low &s;tate of indu&s;try during
this period, was the re&s;traints put upon it; and the par|liament,
or rather the King, (for he was the prime
mover in every thing) enlarged a little &s;ome of the&s;e li|mitations;
but not to the degree that was requi&s;ite. A
law had been enacted during the reign of Henry the
fourth<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">7 H. 7. cap. 17.</NOTE>, that no man could bind his &s;on or daughter to
an apprentice&s;hip, unle&s;s he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of twenty &s;hil|lings
a year in land; and Henry the &s;eventh, becau&s;e
the decay of manufactures was complained of in Norwich
from the want of hands, exempted that city from the
penalties of this law<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">11 H. 7. cap. 11.</NOTE>. Afterwards, the whole county of
Norfolk obtained a like exemption with regard to &s;ome
branches of the woollen manufacture<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">12 H. 7. cap. 1.</NOTE>. The&s;e ab&s;urd
<PB N="425" REF="447">
limitations proceeded from a de&s;ire of promoting hu&s;|bandry,
which however is never more effectually encour|aged
than by the encrea&s;e of manufactures. For a like
rea&s;on, the law enacted again&s;t inclo&s;ures, and for the
keeping up farm hou&s;es<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">4 H. 7. cap. 19.</NOTE>, &s;carce de&s;erves the high prai&s;es
be&s;towed on it by lord Bacon. If hu&s;bandmen under|&s;tood
agriculture, and have a ready vent for their com|modities,
we need never dread a diminution of the people,
employed in the country. All methods of &s;upporting po|pulou&s;ne&s;s,
except by the intere&s;t of the proprietors, are
violent and ineffectual. During a century and a half after
this period, there was a continual renewal of laws and
edicts again&s;t depopulation; whence we may infer, that
none of them were ever executed. The natural cour&s;e
of improvement at la&s;t provided a remedy.</P>
<P>ONE great check to indu&s;try in England was the
erecting corporations; an abu&s;e which is not yet entirely
corrected. A law was enacted, that corporations &s;hould
not pa&s;s any by-laws without the con&s;ent of three of
the chief officers of &s;tate<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">19 H. 7. cap. 7.</NOTE>. They were prohibited to
impo&s;e tolls at their gates<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 8.</NOTE>. The cities of Gloce&s;ter
and Worce&s;ter had even impo&s;ed tolls on the Severne,
which were aboli&s;hed<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is a law of this reign<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">12 H. 7. cap. 6.</NOTE>, containing a pre|amble,
from which it appears, that the company of
merchant adventurers in London, had, by their own
authority, debarred all the other merchants of the king|dom,
from trading to the great marts in the Low Coun|tries,
unle&s;s each trader previou&s;ly payed them the &s;um
of near &s;eventy pounds. It is &s;urpri&s;ing that &s;uch a by-law
(if it de&s;erves that name) could ever be carried into
<PB N="426" REF="448">
execution, and that the authority of parliament &s;hould
be requi&s;ite to abrogate it.</P>
<P>IT was during this reign, on the &s;econd of Augu&s;t
1492, a little before &s;un-&s;et, that Chri&s;topher Columbus,
a Florentine, &s;et out from Cadiz on his memorable voy|age
for the di&s;covery of the we&s;tern world; and a few
years after, Va&s;quez de Gama, a Portugue&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed the
Cape of Good Hope, and opened a new pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t Indies.
The&s;e great events were attended with the
mo&s;t important con&s;equences to all the nations of Eu|rope,
even to &s;uch as were not immediately concerned in
tho&s;e naval enterprizes. The enlargement of commerce
and navigation encrea&s;ed indu&s;try and the arts every
where: The nobles di&s;&s;ipated their fortunes in expen&s;ive
plea&s;ures: Men of an inferior rank both acquired a &s;hare
in the landed property, and created to them&s;elves a con|&s;iderable
property of a new kind, in &s;tock, commodities,
art, credit, and corre&s;pondence. In &s;ome nations the
privileges of the commons encrea&s;ed, by this encrea&s;e of
property: In mo&s;t nations, the Kings, finding arms to
be dropt by the barons, who could no longer endure their
former rude manner of life, e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;tanding armies,
and ma&s;tered the liberties of the kingdom: But in all
places, the condition of the people, from the depre&s;&s;ion of
the petty tyrants, by whom they had formerly been op|pre&s;&s;ed,
rather than governed, received great improve|ment,
and they acquired, if not entire liberty, at lea&s;t
the mo&s;t con&s;iderable advantages of it. And as the ge|neral
cour&s;e of events thus tended to depre&s;s the nobles
and exalt the people, Henry the &s;eventh, who al&s;o em|braced
that &s;y&s;tem of policy, has acquired more prai&s;e,
than his in&s;titutions, &s;trictly &s;peaking, &s;eem of them|&s;elves
to de&s;erve, on account of any profound wi&s;dom
attending them.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="449">
IT was by accident only, that the King had not a
con&s;iderable hand in tho&s;e great naval di&s;coveries, by
which the pre&s;ent age was &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed. Co|lumbus,
after meeting many repul&s;es from the courts of
Portugal and Spain, &s;ent his brother Bartholomew into
England, in order to explain his projects to Henry, and
crave his protection for the execution of them. Henry
invited him to England; but his brother, in returning
to Spain, being taken by pyrates, was detained in
his voyage; and Columbus, meanwhile, having obtained
the countenance of I&s;abella, was &s;upplied with a &s;mall
fleet, and happily executed his enterprize. Henry was
not di&s;couraged by this di&s;appointment: He fitted out
Seba&s;tian Cabot, a Venetian, dwelling in Bri&s;tol; and
&s;ent him we&s;twards in 1498 in &s;earch of new countries.
Cabot di&s;covered the main land of America towards the
&s;ixtieth degree of northern latitude: He &s;ailed &s;outh|wards
along the coa&s;t, and di&s;covered Newfoundland,
and other countries: But returned to England, without
making any conque&s;t or &s;ettlement. Elliot and other
merchants in Bri&s;tol made a like attempt in 1502<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rymer, vol. xiii. p. 37.</NOTE>.
The King expended fourteen thou&s;and pounds in build|ing
one &s;hip called the <HI>Great Harry</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 484.</NOTE>. This was, pro|perly
&s;peaking, the fir&s;t &s;hip in the Engli&s;h navy. Be|fore
this period, when the prince wanted a fleet, he
had no other expedient but hiring &s;hips from the mer|chants.</P>
<P>BUT though this improvement of navigation, and the
di&s;covery of both the Indies, was the mo&s;t memorable
incident that happened during this or any other period,
it was not the only great event by which the age was
di&s;tingui&s;hed. In 1453, Con&s;tantinople was taken by
the Turks; and the Greeks, among whom &s;ome remains

of learning were &s;till pre&s;erved, being &s;cattered by the&s;e
Barbarians, took &s;helter in Italy, and imported, to|gether
with their admirable language, a tincture of their
&s;cience and their refined ta&s;te in poetry and eloquence.
About the &s;ame time, the purity of the Latin tongue was
revived, the &s;tudy of antiquity became fa&s;hionable, and
the e&s;teem for literature gradually propagated it&s;elf
throughout every nation of Europe. The art of printing,
invented about that time, facilitated extremely the pro|gre&s;s
of all the&s;e improvements: The invention of gun|powder
changed the whole art of war: Mighty innova|tions
were &s;oon after made in religion, &s;uch as not only
affected tho&s;e &s;tates that embraced them, but even tho&s;e
that adhered to the antient faith and wor&s;hip: And thus
a general revolution was made in human affairs through|out
this part of the world; and men gradually attained
that &s;ituation, with regard to commerce, arts, &s;ciences,
government, police, and cultivation, in which they have
ever &s;ince per&s;evered. Here therefore commences the
u&s;eful, as well as the mo&s;t agreeable part of modern
annals; certainty has place in all the con&s;iderable, and
even mo&s;t of the minute parts of hi&s;torical narration; a
great variety of events, pre&s;erved by printing, give the
author the power of &s;electing, as well as adorning, the
facts, which he relates; and as each incident has a re|ference
to our pre&s;ent manners and &s;ituation, in&s;tructive
le&s;&s;ons occur every moment during the cour&s;e of the
narration. Whoever carries his anxious re&s;earches into
preceding periods is moved by a curio&s;ity, liberal in|deed
and commendable; not by any nece&s;&s;ity for ac|quiring
a knowledge of public affairs, or the arts of

of his &s;on, Henry the Eighth, &s;pread univer&s;ally a declar|ed
and unfeigned &s;atisfaction.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Popularity of the new King.</NOTE> In&s;tead of a monarch,
jealous, &s;evere, and avaritious, who, in proportion as he
advanced in years, was &s;inking &s;till deeper in tho&s;e unpo|pular
vices; a young prince of eighteen had &s;ucceeded
to the throne, who, even in the eyes of men of &s;en&s;e,
gave very promi&s;ing hopes of his future conduct, much
more in tho&s;e of the people, always enchanted with no|velty,
youth, and royal dignity. The beauty and vi|gour
of his per&s;on, accompanied with dexterity in every
manly exerci&s;e, was farther adorned with a blooming
and ruddy countenance, with a lively air, with the ap|pearance
<PB N="430" REF="454">
of &s;pirit and activity in all his demeanour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">T. Mori, Lucubr. p. 182.</NOTE>.
His father, in order to remove him from the knowledge
of public bu&s;ine&s;s, had hitherto occupied him entirely in
the &s;tudy of literature; and the proficiency, which he
made, gave no bad progno&s;tic of his parts and capacity^b.<NOTE PLACE="foot">Father Paul, lib. 1.</NOTE>.
Even the vices of vehemence, ardour, and impatience,
to which he was &s;ubject, and which afterwards degene|rated
into tyranny, were con&s;idered only as faults, inci|dent
to unguarded youth, which would be corrected,
when time had brought him to greater moderation and
maturity. And as the contending titles of York and
Lanca&s;ter were now at la&s;t fully united in his per&s;on,
men ju&s;tly expected from a prince, obnoxious to no
party, that impartiality of admini&s;tration, which had &s;o
long been unknown in England.</P>
<P>THE favourable prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the public were en|couraged
by the mea&s;ures, which Henry embraced in the
commencement of his reign. His grandmother, the
counte&s;s of Richmond and Derby, was &s;till alive; and
as &s;he was a woman much celebrated for prudence and
virtue, he very wi&s;ely &s;hewed great deference to her opi|nion
in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his new council.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His mini&s;tors.</NOTE> The mem|bers
were Warham, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and
chancellor; the earl of Shrew&s;bury, &s;teward; lord Her|bert,
chamberlain; Sir Thomas Lovel, ma&s;ter of the
wards and con&s;table of the Tower; Sir Edward Poyn|ings,
knight of the garter, comptroller; Sir Henry Mar|ney,
afterwards lord Marney; Sir Thomas Darcy,
afterwards lord Darcy; Thomas Ruthal, doctor of
laws; and Sir Henry Wyat<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Stowe, p. 486. Holling&s;hed, p. 799.</NOTE>. The&s;e men had long
been accu&s;tomed to bu&s;ine&s;s under the late King, and
<PB N="431" REF="455">
were the lea&s;t unpopular of all the mini&s;ters employed
by that monarch.</P>
<P>BUT the chief competitors for favour and authority
under the new King were the earl of Surrey, trea&s;urer,
and Fox, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, &s;ecretary and privy &s;eal.
This prelate, who enjoyed great credit during all the
former reign, had acquired &s;uch habits of caution and
frugality as he could not ea&s;ily lay a&s;ide; and he &s;till op|po&s;ed,
by his remon&s;trances, tho&s;e &s;chemes of di&s;&s;ipation
and expence, which the youth and pa&s;&s;ions of Henry
rendered agreeable to him. But Surrey was a more dex|terous
courtier; and tho' few had borne a greater &s;hare
in the frugal politics of the la&s;t King, he knew how to
conform him&s;elf to the humours of his new ma&s;ter; and
no one was &s;o forward in promoting that liberality, plea|&s;ure,
and magnificence, which began to prevail under the
young monarch<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert.</NOTE>. By this policy he ingratiated him&s;elf with Henry; he made profit, as well as the other cour|tiers,
of the lavi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition of his ma&s;ter; and he en|gaged
him in &s;uch a cour&s;e of play and idlene&s;s as ren|dered
him negligent of affairs, and willing to entru&s;t the
government of the &s;tate entirely into the hands of his
mini&s;ters. The immen&s;e trea&s;ures, ama&s;&s;ed by the late
King, were gradually di&s;&s;ipated in the giddy expences
of Henry. One party of plea&s;ure &s;ucceeded to another:
Tilts, tournaments and carou&s;als were exhibited with all
the magnificence of that age: And as the pre&s;ent tran|quillity
of the public permitted the court to indulge it&s;elf
in every amu&s;ement, &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s was but little at|tended
to. Or if the King intermitted the cour&s;e of
his fe&s;tivity, he employed him&s;elf chiefly in an applica|tion
to mu&s;ic and literature, which were his favourite
<PB N="432" REF="456">
pur&s;uits, and which were well adapted to his genius.
He had made &s;uch proficiency in the former art, as even
to compo&s;e &s;ome pieces of church-mu&s;ic which were
&s;ung in his chapel<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Lord Herbert.</NOTE>. He was initiated in the elegant
learning of the ancients. And tho' he was &s;o unfor|tunate
as to be &s;educed into a &s;tudy of the barren con|trover&s;ies
of the &s;chools, which were then fa&s;hionable,
and had cho&s;en Thomas Aquinas for his favourite au|thor,
he &s;till di&s;covered a capacity fitted for more u&s;eful
and entertaining knowledge.</P>
<P>THE frank and carele&s;s humour of the King, as it
led him to di&s;&s;ipate the trea&s;ures, ama&s;&s;ed by his father,
rendered him negligent in protecting the in&s;truments,
whom that prince had employed in his extortions. A
proclamation being i&s;&s;ued to encourage complaints, the
rage of the people was let loo&s;e on all the informers,
who had &s;o long exerci&s;ed an unbounded tyranny over
the nation<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Stowe, p. 486. Holling&s;hed, p. 799. Polyd. Virg. lib. 27.</NOTE>: They were thrown into pri&s;on, condemned
to the pillory, and mo&s;t of them lo&s;t their lives by
the violence of the populace.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Puni&s;h|ment
of Emp&s;on and Dud|ley.</NOTE> Emp&s;on and Dudley, who
were mo&s;t expo&s;ed to public hatred, were immediately
cited before the council, in order to an&s;wer for their
conduct, which had rendered them &s;o obnoxious. Emp|&s;on
made a &s;hrewd apology for him&s;elf, as well as for
his a&s;&s;ociate. He told the council, that &s;o far from his
being ju&s;tly obnoxious to cen&s;ure for his pa&s;t conduct,
his enemies them&s;elves grounded their clamour on ac|tions,
which &s;eemed rather to merit reward and approba|tion:
That a &s;trict execution of law was the crime, of
which he and Dudley were accu&s;ed; tho' that law
<PB N="433" REF="457">
had been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the voluntary con&s;ent of the
people, and tho' they had acted in obedience to the
King, to whom the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice was
entru&s;ted by the con&s;titution: That it belonged not
to them, who were in&s;truments in the hands of
the &s;upreme power, to determine what laws were
recent or ob&s;olete, expedient or hurtful; &s;ince they
were all alike valid, &s;o long as they remained unrepealed
by the legi&s;lature: That it was natural for a licentious
populace to murmur again&s;t the re&s;traints of authority;
but all wi&s;e &s;tates had ever made their glory to con&s;i&s;t
in the ju&s;t di&s;tribution of reward and puni&s;hment, and
had annexed the former to the ob&s;ervance and enforce|ment
of the laws, the latter to their violation and infrac|tion:
And that a &s;udden overthrow of all government
might be expected; where the judges were committed
to the mercy of the criminals, the rulers to that of the
&s;ubjects<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Herbert, Holling&s;hed, p. 804.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this defence, Emp&s;on and Dud|ley
were &s;ent to the Tower; and &s;oon after brought to
their trial. The &s;trict execution of laws, however ob|&s;olete, could never be imputed to them as a crime in a
court of judicature; and it is likely, that even where they
had exerci&s;ed arbitrary power, the King, as they had
acted by the &s;ecret commands of his father, was not
willing that their conduct &s;hould undergo too &s;evere a
&s;crutiny. In order, therefore, to gratify the people with
the puni&s;hment of the&s;e obnoxious mini&s;ters, crimes
very improbable, or indeed ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, were
charged upon them, that they had entered into a
con&s;piracy again&s;t the King, and had intended, on
the death of the late King, to have &s;eized by
<PB N="434" REF="458">
force the admini&s;tration of the government. The jury
were &s;o far moved by popular prejudices, joined to
court influence, as to give a verdict again&s;t them; which
was afterwards confirmed by a bill of attainder in par|liament<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">This Parliament met on the 21&s;t January, 15$0. A law was there enacted, in order to prevent &s;ome abu&s;es which had prevailed during the late reign. The forfeiture upon the penal &s;tatutes was reduced to the term of three years. Co&s;ts and damages were given again&s;t infor|mers upon acquittal of the accu&s;ed: More &s;evere puni&s;hments were enacted again&s;t perjury: The fal&s;e inqui&s;itions procured by Emp&s;on and Dudley were declared null and invalid. Traver&s;es were allowed; and the time of tendering them enlarged. 1 H. 8. c. 8. 10, 11, 12.</NOTE>,
and, at the earne&s;t de&s;ire of the people, was
executed by warrant from the King. Thus, in tho&s;e
arbitrary times, ju&s;tice was equally violated, whether the
King &s;ought power and riches, or courted popularity.</P>
<P>THE King, while he puni&s;hed the in&s;truments of pa&s;t
tyranny, had yet &s;uch deference to former engagements
as to d$$$berate, immediately after his acce&s;&s;ion, concern|ing
the con&s;ummation of his marriage with the infanta
Catherine, to whom he was affianced during his father's
lifetime.<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's marriage.</NOTE> Her former marriage with his brother, and
the inequality of their years, were the chief objections,
which were urged again&s;t the e&s;pou&s;ing her: But on the
other hand, the advantages of her known virtue, mode&s;ty, and
&s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition were in&s;i&s;ted on; the affection
which &s;he bore the King; the large dowry to which &s;he
was entitled as prince&s;s of Wales; the intere&s;t of ce|menting
a clo&s;e alliance with Spain; the nece&s;&s;ity of
finding &s;ome confederate to counterbalance the power
of France; the expediency of fulfilling the engage|ments
of the late King. When the&s;e con&s;iderations
were weighed, they determined the council, tho' con|trary
to the opinion of the primate, to give Henry their
<PB N="435" REF="459">
advice for compleating the marriage; which was done ac|cordingly.

<P>THE popularity of Henry's government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1510.</NOTE> his indi&s;puted
title to the throne, his exten&s;ive authority, his large trea|&s;ures,
the tranquillity of his &s;ubjects, were circum&s;tances
which rendered his dome&s;tic admini&s;tration ea&s;y and pro&s;|perous:
The &s;ituation of foreign affairs was no le&s;s hap|py
and de&s;irable.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign af|fairs.</NOTE> Italy continued &s;till, as during the late
reign, to be the center of all the wars and negotiations of
the European princes; and Henry's alliance was courted
by both &s;ides; at the &s;ame time, that he was not engaged
by any immediate intere&s;t or nece&s;&s;ity to take part with
either. Lewis the Twelfth of France, after the con|que&s;t
of Milan, was the only great prince who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
any territory in Italy; and could he have remained in
tranquillity, he was enabled by his &s;ituation to pre&s;cribe
laws to all the Italian princes and republics, and to hold
the balance among them. But the de&s;ire of making a
conque&s;t of Naples, to which he had the &s;ame title or
preten&s;ion with his predece&s;&s;or, &s;till engaged him in new
enterprizes; and as he fore&s;aw oppo&s;ition from Ferdi|nand,
who was connected both by treaties and affinity
with Frederic of Naples, he endeavoured, by the offers
of intere&s;t, to which the ears of that monarch were ever
open, to engage him in an oppo&s;ite confederacy. He
&s;ettled with him a plan for the partition of the kingdom
of Naples and the expul&s;ion of Frederic: A plan,
which the politicians of that age regarded as the mo&s;t
egregious imprudence in the French monarch, and the
ba&s;e&s;t treachery in the Spani&s;h. Frederic, &s;upported only
by &s;ubjects, who were either di&s;contented with his go|vernment,
<PB N="436" REF="460">
or indifferent about his fortunes, was unable
to re&s;i&s;t &s;o powerful a confederacy, and was deprived of
his dominions: But he had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee Naples
immediately prove the &s;ource of contention among his
enemies. Ferdinand gave &s;ecret orders to his general,
Gon&s;alvo, whom the Spaniards honour with the appella|tion
of the <HI>great captain,</HI> to attack the armies of France, and
make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of all the dominions of Naples.
Gon&s;alvo prevailed in every enterprize, defeated the
French in two pitched battles, and en&s;ured to his
prince the entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that kingdom. Lewis,
unable to procure redre&s;s by force of arms, was obliged
to enter into a fruitle&s;s negotiation with Ferdinand for
the recovery of his &s;hare of the partition; and all Italy,
during &s;ome time, was held in &s;u&s;pence between the&s;e
two powerful monarchs.</P>
<P>THERE &s;carce has been any period, when the ba|lance
of power was bettter &s;ecured in Europe, and
&s;eemed more able to maintain it&s;elf, without any anxious
concern or attention of the princes. Several great mo|narchies
were e&s;tabli&s;hed; and no one &s;o far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed
the re&s;t as to give any foundation, or even pretence, for
jealou&s;y. England was united in dome&s;tic peace, and
by its &s;ituation happily &s;ecured from the inva&s;ion of
foreigners. The coalition of the &s;everal kingdoms of
Spain, had formed one powerful monarchy, which Fer|dinand
admini&s;tered with arts fraudulent indeed and de|ceitful,
but full of vigour and ability. Lewis the
Twelfth of France, a gallant and generous prince, by
e&s;pou&s;ing Anne of Brittany, widow to his predece&s;&s;or, had
pre&s;erved the union with that principality, on which the
&s;afety of his kingdom &s;o much depended. Maximilian,
the emperor, be&s;ides the hereditary dominions of the Au|&s;trian
family, maintained authority in the empire, and
<PB N="437" REF="461">
notwith&s;tanding his levity of di&s;po&s;ition, was able to unite
the German princes in any great plan of intere&s;t, at lea&s;t,
of defence. Charles, prince of Ca&s;tile, grand&s;on to
Maximilian and Ferdinand, had already &s;ucceeded to
the rich dominions of the hou&s;e of Burgundy; and being
as yet in early youth, the government was entru&s;ted
to Margaret of Savoy, his aunt, a prince&s;s endowed
with &s;ignal prudence and virtue. The internal force
of the&s;e &s;everal powerful &s;tates, which balanced each
other, might long have maintained general tranquillity,
had not the active and enterprizing genius of an ambi|tious
pontiff fir&s;t excited the &s;lames of war and di&s;cord
among them.</P>
<P>ALEXANDER the Sixth was dead; a man of a &s;ingu|lar

<P>THIS illu&s;trious commonwealth, the great bulwark of
Europe again&s;t the barbarians, and the admired model
of civil polity, had ri&s;en to a con&s;iderable power, and
began to make a figure, which during that age bore
&s;ome proportion to that of the great monarchies. Her
riches &s;urpa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e of any European city, her finances
were great, her commerce exten&s;ive, her naval power
formidable, her armies numerous and well &s;upplied.
Tru&s;ting only to her own power, &s;he had neglected
to maintain a cordial friend&s;hip with any other &s;tate;
and by the endle&s;s political &s;u&s;picions, which &s;he enter|tained
even of her be&s;t allies, &s;he had taught them to
regard her progre&s;s with like jealou&s;y. No &s;tate
could rea&s;onably complain of any inju&s;tice and u&s;ur|pations
in her mea&s;ures: But as great monarchs ne|ver
&s;ee without di&s;plea&s;ure a republic nearly on a
a level with them&s;elves, it was ea&s;y for Julius, by his
negotiations among the European princes, to compleat
his &s;cheme of a confederacy again&s;t her. Ferdinand
de&s;ired to wre&s;t from the Venetians &s;ome towns on the
coa&s;t of Naples, which his predece&s;&s;or had voluntarily,
for money, con&s;igned into their hand: Lewis propo&s;ed
to recover a part of the territory of Milan, which he
him&s;elf had delivered to them by treaty: Maximilian
laid claim to great part of their dominions, which they
had acquired from petty princes or tyrants, that had
formarly, $word$ as he pretended, in &s;ome di&s;tant period, u&s;urp|ed
the$ from the empire: The pope, from like pre|te$$es,
challenged another part of their dominions, as
the pa$rimony of the church. In order to cover the
&s;$cheme of this confederacy, the cardinal d'Amboi&s;e,
prime mini&s;ter of France, had met at Cambray with
<PB N="439" REF="465">
Margaret of Savoy, under colour of accommodating a
difference between her and the duke of Guelders; and
it was there, that the alliance again&s;t Venice was &s;e|cretly
&s;igned by the contracting powers, and all the
mea&s;ures of operation concerted<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 8. Bembo.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Venetians were appri&s;ed of their danger, and
prepared them&s;elves for re&s;i&s;tance. They provided eve|ry
means of defence, except the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential, brave
and warlike forces, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e, where
the ideas of military glory are extingui&s;hed, and men
have, from long habit, acquired other objects of ambi|tion.
They &s;ent into the field an army of 40,000 men
under experienced leaders, the count of Pitigliano and
Bartholomew Alviano; and hoped, that &s;o great a force
would &s;ecure them from the inva&s;ion of Lewis, who had
led an army into Italy, and fir&s;t took the field again&s;t
them. But the martial nobility of France, headed by
their gallant &s;overeign, utterly di&s;comfitted the&s;e enervat|ed
forces; and in the action of Ghierradadda, the power
and glory of Venice, the re&s;ult of con&s;ummate wi&s;dom,
and the work of ages, &s;uffered in one day a check,
which it has never yet been able thoroughly to recover<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Sei&s;&s;el. hi&s;t. Louis XII. St. Gela $word$ Guicciard. lib. 8.</NOTE>.
Di&s;mayed with this lo&s;s, the Venetians took a ha&s;ty re|&s;olution
of abandoning all their dominions on the con|tinent
of Italy; and they accordingly withdrew their
garri&s;ons from every place, and freed their &s;ubjects from
their oaths of allegiance. Lewis immediately put him|&s;elf
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cremona, Bergamo, Bre&s;cia, Creme,
and all the places which had been di&s;membered from
the Milane&s;e. Even Verona, Padua, Vicenza, and
other towns, which, by the treaty of Cambray, fell
<PB N="440" REF="466">
under the partition of Maximilian, offered to open their
gates to the French monarch. Had Maximilian, in&s;tead
of wa&s;ting his time at Trent, led his forces early into
Italy, an end had been put for ever to the power and do|minion
of Venice. But Lewis, well acquainted with
the ficklene&s;s and incon&s;tancy of that prince, was deter|mined
to give him no pretext for de&s;erting his alliance;
and therefore ordered the magi&s;trates of tho&s;e towns to
make their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the emperor, whom, he told
them, they were now to regard as their lawful &s;overeign<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Buonacor&s;i, Petrus de Angleria, epi&s;t. 418.</NOTE>.
The Venetian &s;enate, ob&s;erving tho&s;e delays, and re|marking
the extreme regret, which their &s;ubjects di&s;|covered
on lo&s;ing the mild and equitable government of
the republic<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Guicciard. lib. 8.</NOTE>, began again to a&s;&s;ume courage, and rein|&s;tated
them&s;elves in the dominion of tho&s;e cities, which
they had abandoned. From this time, their prudence
and &s;ound policy gave a check to the malignity of their
fortune and the &s;uperiority of their enemies. They vo|luntarily
made a &s;acrifice to Ferdinand of tho&s;e towns,
which he laid claim to, and thereby detached him from
the alliance<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Petrus de Angleria.</NOTE>. They gratified the ambition of the Pope
by a like &s;acrifice; and farther flattered his vanity by the
lowe&s;t obei&s;ance and the mo&s;t dutiful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Bembo.</NOTE>.
After trying like arts with Maximilian, and finding his
preten&s;ions to be utterly exorbitant, they rouzed their
patriot &s;pirit, and prepared them&s;elves for re&s;i&s;tance, with
a courage, which, tho' ill &s;econded by the unwarlike
genius of their people, might have done honour to the
Roman &s;enate during the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing period of the
republic.</P>
<P>THE great force and &s;ecure &s;ituation of the con&s;ider|able
monarchies, prevented any one of them from a&s;pir|ing
<PB N="441" REF="467">
to any conque&s;t of moment; and tho' this con|&s;ideration
could not maintain general peace, or remedy
the natural inquietude of men, it rendered the princes of
this age more ea&s;y in de&s;erting engagements and changing
their alliances, in which they were retained more by hu|mour
and caprice than by any natural or durable intere&s;t.
Julius had no &s;ooner humbled the Venetian republic, than
he was in&s;pired with a nobler ambition, that of expelling
all foreigners from Italy, or, to &s;peak in the &s;tile af|fcted
by the Italians of that age, the freeing that coun|try
entirely from the dominion of the Barbarians<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Guicciard. lib. 8.</NOTE>. He
was determined to make the tempe&s;t fall fir&s;t upon Lewis;
and in order to pave the way for this great enterprize, he
at once &s;ought for a ground of quarrel with that mo|narch,
and courted the alliance of other princes. He
declared war again&s;t the duke of Ferrara, the confede|rate
of Lewis. He &s;olicited the favour of England, by
&s;ending Henry a &s;acred ro&s;e, perfumed with mu&s;k and
anointed with chri&s;m<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Spelman, Concil. vol. ii. p. 725.</NOTE>. He engaged in his intere&s;t Bam|bridge
archbi&s;hop of York, and Henry's amba&s;&s;ador at
Rome, whom he &s;oon after created cardinal. He drew
over Ferdinand to his &s;ide, tho' that monarch, at fir&s;t,
made no declaration of his intentions. And what he
chiefly valued, he framed a treaty with the Swi&s;s cantons,
who, enraged by &s;ome neglects put upon them by Lewis,
accompanied with contumelious expre&s;&s;ions, had de&s;erted
the alliance of France, and waited an opportunity of
revenging them&s;elves on that nation.</P>
<P>LEWIS was determined not to abandon the duke of
Ferrara, who &s;uffered merely for his attachment to the
crown of France. Chaumont, his lieutenant in the
Milane&s;e, received orders to defend him again&s;t Julius,
<PB N="442" REF="468">
who, &s;upported by his own dauntle&s;s &s;pirit, and con|fiding
in the &s;acredne&s;s of his character, had &s;et his ene|my
at defiance. By a happy and unexpected movement,
Chaumont &s;urrounded the pope and all his court in Bo|logna;
and had he not allowed him&s;elf to be amu&s;ed by a
treaty, which his profound re&s;pect for the holy father
made him the more willing to hearken to, he had been
able, without any blood&s;hed, to have reduced him to
captivity. Finding him&s;elf expo&s;ed to &s;evere cen&s;ure for
not pu&s;hing his advantages, he was agitated with &s;uch
violent regret, that he fell into a langui&s;hing illne&s;s, of
which he &s;oon after died; tho' oppo&s;ite remor&s;es took
place on his death-bed, and he very humbly craved of
his holine&s;s a remi&s;&s;ion of his grievous &s;in, in having at
all born arms again&s;t him<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">L'abb&eacute; du Bos, Hi&s;toire de la Ligue de Combray.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE the French monarch repelled the attacks of
his enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1511.</NOTE> he thought it al&s;o requi&s;ite to make an at|tack
on the pope him&s;elf, and to de&s;poil him, as much
as po&s;&s;ible, of that &s;acred character, which chiefly ren|dered
him formidable. He engaged &s;ome cardinals, di&s;|gu&s;ted
with the violence of Julius, to de&s;ert him; and
by their authority, he was determined, in conjunction
with Maximilian, who &s;till adhered to his alliance, to call
a general council, which might reform the church, and
check the exorbitancies of the Roman pontiff. A coun|cil
Was &s;ummoned at Pi&s;a, which from the beginning
bore a very inau&s;picious a&s;pect, and promi&s;ed little &s;uc|ce&s;s
to its adherents. Except a few French bi&s;hops,
who unwillingly obeyed their King's orders in attend|ing
the council, all the other prelates kept at a di&s;tance
from an a&s;&s;embly, which they regarded as the offspring
of faction, intrigue, and worldly politics. Even Pi&s;a,
<PB N="443" REF="469">
the place of their re&s;idence, &s;howed them &s;igns of con|tempt;
which engaged them to transfer their &s;e&s;&s;ion to
Milan, a town under the dominion of the French mo|narch.
Notwith&s;tanding this advantage, they did not
experience much more re&s;pectful treatment from the
inhabitants of Milan; and found it nece&s;&s;ary to make
another remove to Lyons<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 10.</NOTE>. Lewis him&s;elf fortified
the&s;e violent prejudices in favour of the papal authority,
by the &s;ymptoms, which he di&s;covered, of regard, de|ference,
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Julius, whom he always &s;pared,
even when fortune had thrown into his hands the mo&s;t
inviting opportunities of humbling him. And as it was
known, that his con&s;ort, who had great authority with
him, was extremely di&s;quieted in mind, on account of
his di&s;&s;entions with the holy father, all men progno&s;ti|cated
to Julius final &s;ucce&s;s in this unequal conte&s;t.</P>
<P>THAT enterprizing pope knew his advantages, and
availed him&s;elf of them with the utmo&s;t temerity and
in&s;olence. So much had he neglected his pontifical cha|racter,
that he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in per&s;on at the &s;iege of Miran|dola,
vi&s;ited the trenches, &s;aw &s;ome of his attendants
killed by his &s;ide, and, like a young &s;oldier, chearfully
bore all the rigours of winter and a &s;evere &s;ea&s;on, in
pur&s;uit of military glory<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. lib. 9.</NOTE>: Yet was he &s;till able to
throw, even on his mo&s;t moderate opponents, the charge
of impiety and prophanene&s;s. He &s;ummoned a council
at the Lateran: He put Pi&s;a under an interdict, and al$
the places which gave &s;helter to the &s;chi&s;matical council:
He excommunicated the cardinals and prelates who at|tended
it: He even directed his &s;piritual thunders again&s;t

FERDINAND of Arragon, who had acquired the &s;ir|name
of the Catholic, regarded the cau&s;e of the pope
and of religion only as a cover to his ambition and &s;elf|i&s;h
politics: Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1512.</NOTE> naturally &s;incere and &s;anguine in
his temper, and the more &s;o on account of his youth
and inexperience, was moved with a hearty de&s;ire of
protecting the pope from that oppre&s;&s;ion, to which he be|lieved
him expo&s;ed from the ambitious enterprizes of
Lewis. Hopes had been given him by Julius, that the
title of the <HI>mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King,</HI> which had hitherto been
annexed to the crown of France, and which was regarded
as its mo&s;t precious ornament, would, in reward of his
&s;ervices, be transferred to that of England<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Guicciard. lib. xi. P. Daniel, vol. ii. p. 1893. Herbert, Hol|ling&s;hed, p. 831.</NOTE>. Impatient
al&s;o of acquiring that di&s;tinction in Europe, to which his
power and opulence entitled him, he could not long re|main
neuter amid&s;t the noi&s;e of arms; and the natural
enmity of the Engli&s;h again&s;t France, as well as their
antient claims upon that kingdom, led Henry to join
that alliance which the pope, Spain, and Venice had
formed again&s;t the French monarch. A herald was &s;ent
to Paris, to exhort Lewis not to wage impious war
again&s;t the pope; and when he returned without &s;ucce&s;s,
another was &s;ent to make a demand of the antient pa|trimonial
provinces, Anjou, Maine, Guienne, and Nor|mandy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France. 4th of Fe|bruary.</NOTE>
This me&s;&s;age was under&s;tood as a declaration

<P>BUONAVISO, an agent of the pope at London, had
been corrupted by the court of France, and had previ|ou&s;ly
revealed to Lewis all the mea&s;ures which Henry
was concerting again&s;t him. But this infidelity did the
<PB N="445" REF="471">
King incon&s;iderable prejudice, in compari&s;on of what he
experienced from the &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es of the ally, to
whom he chiefly tru&s;ted for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Ferdinand, his
father-in-law, had &s;o long per&s;evered in a cour&s;e of crook|ed
politics, that he began even to value him&s;elf on his
dexterity in fraud and artifice; and he made a boa&s;t of
tho&s;e &s;hameful &s;ucce&s;&s;es. Being told one day, that Lewis
the twelfth, a prince of a very different character, had
complained that he had once cheated him: &startq;He lies,
the drunkard!&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;I have cheated him above
twenty times.&endq; This prince con&s;idered his clo&s;e con|nexion
with Henry, only as the means which enabled
him the better to take advantage of his want of expe|rience.
He advi&s;ed him not to invade France by the
way of Calais, where he him&s;elf &s;hould not have it in
his power to a&s;&s;i&s;t him: He exhorted him rather to &s;end
forces to Fontarabia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expedition to Font|arabia.</NOTE> whence he could ea&s;ily make a
conque&s;t of Guienne, a province, in which, it was ima|gined,
the Engli&s;h had &s;till &s;ome adherents. He pro|mi&s;ed
to a&s;&s;i&s;t this conque&s;t by the junction of a Spani&s;h
army. And &s;o forward did he &s;eem to promote the in|tere&s;t
of his &s;on-in-law, that he even &s;ent ve&s;&s;els into
England, to tran&s;port over the forces which Henry had
levied for that purpo&s;e. The marquis of Dor&s;et com|manded
the&s;e troops, which con&s;i&s;ted of ten thou&s;and
men, mo&s;tly infantry; the lord Howard, &s;on to the earl
of Surry, the lord Broke, lord Ferrars, and many others
of the young gentry and nobility, accompanied him in
this &s;ervice. All were on fire to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves
by military atchievements, and to make a conque&s;t of
importance for their ma&s;ter. The &s;ecret purpo&s;e of Fer|dinand
in this unexampled genero&s;ity was &s;u&s;pected by
no body.</P>
<P>THE &s;mall kingdom of Navarre lies on the frontiers
between France and Spain; and as John d'Albert, the
<PB N="446" REF="472">
pre&s;ent King, was connected in friend&s;hip and alliance
with Lewis, the opportunity &s;eemed favourable to Ferdi|nand,
while the Engli&s;h forces were conjoined with his
own, and while all adherents to the council of Pi&s;a lay
under the &s;entence of excommunication, to put him&s;elf
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e dominions. No &s;ooner, therefore,
was Dor&s;et landed in Guipi&s;coa, than the Spani&s;h mo|narch
declared his readine&s;s to join him with his forces,
to make jointly an inva&s;ion of France, and to form the
&s;iege of Bayonne, which opened the way into Guienne<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Holling&s;hed, p. 813.</NOTE>:
But he remarked to the Engli&s;h general how dangerous
it might prove to leave behind them the kingdom of
Navarre, which, being in clo&s;e alliance with France,
could ea&s;ily give admittance to the enemy, and cut off
all communication between Spain and the combined
armies. To provide again&s;t &s;o dangerous an event, he
required, that John &s;hould &s;tipulate a neutrality in the
pre&s;ent war; and when that prince expre&s;&s;ed his willing|ne&s;s
to enter into any engagement for that purpo&s;e, he
al&s;o required that he &s;hould give &s;ecurity for his &s;trict
ob&s;ervance of it. John having likewi&s;e agreed to this
condition, Ferdinand demanded, that he &s;hould deliver
into his hands &s;ix of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable places of his
dominions, together with his elde&s;t &s;on as a ho&s;tage.
The&s;e were not conditions to be propo&s;ed to a &s;overeign;
and as the Spani&s;h monarch expected a refu&s;al, he gave
immediate orders to the duke of Alva, his general, to
make an inva&s;ion of Navarre, and to reduce the whole
kingdom to &s;ubjection. Alva &s;oon made him&s;elf ma&s;ter
of all the &s;maller towns; and being ready to form the
&s;iege of Pampeluna, the capital, he &s;ummoned the mar|quis
of Dor&s;et to join him with the Engli&s;h army, and
to concert together all their operations.</P>
<P><PB N="447" REF="473">
DORSET began to &s;u&s;pect, that his ma&s;ter's intere&s;ts
were very little regarded in all the&s;e tran&s;actions; and
having no orders to invade the kingdom of Navarre, or
make war any where but in France, he refu&s;ed to take
any part in that enterprize.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deceit of Ferdinand.</NOTE> He remained therefore in his
quarters at Fontarabia; but &s;o politic was the contrivance
of Ferdinand, that even while the Engli&s;h army lay in
that &s;ituation, it was almo&s;t equally &s;erviceable to his
purpo&s;es, as if it had acted in conjunction with his own.
It kept the French army in awe, and prevented it from
advancing to &s;uccour the kingdom of Navarre; &s;o that
Alva, having full lei&s;ure to conduct the &s;iege, made him|&s;elf
ma&s;ter of Pampeluna, and obliged John to &s;eek for
&s;helter in France. The Spani&s;h general applied again to
Dor&s;et, and propo&s;ed to conduct with united councils the
operations of the <HI>holy league,</HI> &s;o it was called, again&s;t
Lewis: But as he &s;till declined forming the &s;iege of
Bayonne, and rather in&s;i&s;ted on the inva&s;ion of the prin|cipality
of Bearne, a part of the King of Navarre's do|minions,
which lies on the French &s;ide of the Pyrenees,
Dor&s;et, ju&s;tly &s;u&s;picious of his &s;ini&s;ter intentions, repre|&s;ented,
that, without new orders from his ma&s;ter, he
could not concur in &s;uch an undertaking. In order to
procure &s;uch orders, Ferdinand di&s;patched Martin de
Ampios, as his envoy, to London; and per&s;uaded
Henry, that, by the refractory and &s;crupulous humour of
the Engli&s;h general, the mo&s;t favourable opportunities
were lo&s;t, and that it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould, in all
things, act in concert with the Spani&s;h commander,
who was be&s;t acquainted with the &s;ituation of the coun|try,
and the rea&s;ons of every operation. But before or|ders
to this purpo&s;e reached Spain, Dor&s;et had become
extremely impatient; and ob&s;erving that his farther &s;tay
&s;erved not to promote the main undertaking, and that his
army was daily peri&s;hing by want and &s;ickne&s;s, he de|manded
<PB N="448" REF="474">
&s;hipping from Ferdinand to tran&s;port them back
into England. Ferdinand, who was bound by treaty to
furni&s;h him with this &s;upply, whenever demanded, was
at la&s;t, after many delays, obliged to yield to his impor|tunity;
and Dor&s;et, embarking his troops, prepared
him&s;elf for the voyage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Return of the Engli&s;h.</NOTE> Meanwhile, a me&s;&s;enger ar|river
with orders from Henry, that the troops &s;hould

with the treatment which they had met with, that they
mutinied, and obliged their commanders to &s;et &s;ail for
England. Henry was much di&s;plea&s;ed with the ill &s;uc|ce&s;s
of this enterprize; and it was with difficulty, that
Dor&s;et, by explaining the fraudulent intentions of Fer|dinand,
was at la&s;t able to appea&s;e him.</P>
<P>THERE happened this &s;ummer an action at &s;ea, which
brought not any more deci&s;ive advantage to the Engli&s;h.
Sir Thomas Knevet, ma&s;ter of hor&s;e, was &s;ent to the
coa&s;t of Brittany with a fleet of forty-five &s;ail; and he
carried with him Sir Charles Brandon, Sir John Carew,
and many other young courtiers, who longed for an op|portunity
of di&s;playing their valour. After committing
&s;ome depredations, a French &s;leet of thirty-nine &s;ail
i&s;&s;ued from Bre&s;t, under the command of Primauget<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Or rather Por&s;mauget, according to P. Daniel's conjecture, vol. ii. p. 1901. Hence the Engli&s;h &s;eamen called him Sir Pierce Morgan.</NOTE>,
and began an engagement with the Engli&s;h. Primau|get's
&s;hip was &s;et on fire, who finding hi$ de&s;truction in|evitable,
bore down upon the ve&s;&s;el of the Engli&s;h ad|miral,
and grappling with her, re&s;olved to make her
&s;hare the &s;ame fate. The &s;hips of both fleets &s;tood for

and all men &s;aw with horror the flames which
con&s;umed both ve&s;&s;els, and heard the cries of fury and

the beginning of the campaign, had attained in Italy.
Ga&s;ton de Foix, his nephew, a young hero, had been
entru&s;ted with the command of the French forces; and
in a few months performed &s;uch feats of military art and
prowe&s;s, as were &s;ufficient to render illu&s;trious the whole
life of the olde&s;t captain<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Guicciard. lib. 10.</NOTE>. His career fini&s;hed with the
great battle of Ravenna, which, after the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate
conflict, he gained over the Spani&s;h and papal armies.
He peri&s;hed the very moment his victory way compleat;
and with him peri&s;hed the fortune of the French arms
in Italy. The Swi&s;s, who had rendered them&s;elves ex|tremely
formidable by their bands of di&s;ciplined infantry,
invaded the Milane&s;e with a numerous army, and rai&s;ed
up that incon&s;tant people to a revolt again&s;t the domi|nion
of France. Genoa followed the example of that
dutchy; and thus Lewis, in a few weeks, entirely lo&s;t
his Italian conque&s;ts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1513.</NOTE> except &s;ome garri&s;ons; and Maxi|milian

&s;urvived this &s;ucce&s;s a very little time; and in his

of Leo the tenth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21&s;t of Fe|bruary. Leo the tenth.</NOTE> and proved one of the mo&s;t illu&s;tri|ous

forming great de&s;igns than his predece&s;&s;or, but was more
gentle, pliant, and artful in employing means for the
execution of them. By his negotiations, the emperor
Maximilian was detached from the French intere&s;t; and
Henry, notwith&s;tanding his di&s;appointments in the for|mer
campaign, was &s;till encouraged to pro&s;ecute his
warlike mea&s;ures again&s;t Lewis.</P>
<P>HENRY hud &s;ummoned a new &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">4th of November, 1512.</NOTE>,
and obtained a &s;upply for his enterprize.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A parlia|ment.</NOTE> It was a poll|tax,

marks; every man valued at eight hundred pounds in
goods, four marks. An impo&s;ition was al&s;o granted of
two fifteenths and four tenths<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Stowe.</NOTE>. With the&s;e &s;upplies,
joined to the trea&s;ure which had been left by his father,
and which was not yet entirely di&s;&s;ipated, he was enabled
to levy a great army, and render him&s;elf very formidable
to his enemy. The Engli&s;h are &s;aid to have been much
encouraged in this enterprize, by the arrival of a ve&s;&s;el
in the Thames under the papal banner. It carried pre|&s;ents
of wine and hams to the King, and all the mo&s;t
eminent courtiers; and &s;uch fond devotion was at that

IN order to prevent all di&s;turbance from Scotland,

again&s;t that nation; but he had no &s;ooner got to &s;ea,
than he abu&s;ed this liberty, committed depredations upon

the borderers, who wanted but a pretence for depreda|tions,
entered England under the command of lord
Hume, warden of the marches, and committed great
ravages on that kingdom. Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e mu|tual
grounds of di&s;&s;atisfaction, matters might ea&s;ily have

was farther incited to take part in the quarrel by the in|vitations
of Anne, Queen of France, who&s;e knight he
had ever in all tournaments profe&s;t him&s;elf, and who
&s;ummoned him, according to the ideas of romantic gal|lantry,
prevalent in that age, to take the field in her de|fence,
and prove him&s;elf her true and valorous cham|pion.
The remon&s;trances of his con&s;ort and of his wi&s;e&s;t
coun&s;ellors, were in vain oppo&s;ed to the martial ardour
of that prince. He fir&s;t &s;ent a &s;quadron of &s;hips to the

<P>HENRY, all on fire for military fame, was little di&s;|couraged
by this appearance of a diver&s;ion from the

with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all the con&s;iderable potentates of
Europe in his inva&s;ion of France. The pope &s;till con|tinued
to thunder out his excommunications again&s;t

of alliance again&s;t that power, and had ftipulated the
time and place of their intended inva&s;ion: And though
Ferdinand di&s;avowed his amba&s;&s;ador, and even &s;igned a
truce for a twelvemonth with the common enemy; Henry
was not yet fully convinced of his &s;elfi&s;h and &s;ini&s;ter in|tentions,
and &s;till hoped for his concurrence after the

<P>THOMAS WOLSEY, dean of Lincoln, and almoner

courtiers, and was fa&s;t advancing towards that unrivalled
grandeur, which he afterwards attained. This man was
the &s;on of a butcher at Ip&s;wich; but having got a learned
education, and being endowed with an excellent capa|city,
he was admitted into the marquis of Dor&s;et's family
as tutor to that nobleman's children, and &s;oon gained the
friend&s;hip and countenance of his patron<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 997.</NOTE>. He was re|commended
as chaplain to Henry the Seventh, and be|ing
employed by that monarch in a &s;ecret negotiation,
which regarded his intended marriage with Margaret of
Savoy, Maximilian's daughter, he acquitted him&s;elf to
the King's &s;atisfaction, and obtained the prai&s;e both of
diligence and dexterity in his conduct<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cavendi&s;h, Fiddes's life of Wol&s;ey. Stowe.</NOTE>. That prince
having given him a commi&s;&s;ion to Maximilian, who at
that time re&s;ided in Bru&s;&s;els, was &s;urprized, in le&s;s than
three days after, to &s;ee Wol&s;ey pre&s;ent him&s;elf before
him; and &s;uppo&s;ing that he had protracted his departure,
he began to reprove him for the dilatory execution of his
orders. Wol&s;ey informed him, that he was ju&s;t returned
from Bru&s;&s;els, and had &s;ucce&s;sfully fulfilled all his ma|je&s;ty's commands. &startq;But on &s;econd tho$ghts,&endq; &s;aid
the King, &startq;I found that &s;omewhat was omitted in
your orders; and have &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger after you
with fuller in&s;tructions.&endq; &startq;I met the me&s;&s;enger,&endq;
replied Wol&s;ey, &startq;on my return: But as I had reflect|ed
on that omi&s;&s;ion, I ventured of my&s;elf to exe|cute
<PB N="454" REF="480">
what, I knew, mu&s;t be your maje&s;ty's inten|tions.&endq;
The death of Henry, &s;oon after this incident,
was the rea&s;on why Wol&s;ey reaped no advantage from
the good opinion, which that monarch had entertained
of him: But from that moment he was looked on at
court as a ri&s;ing man; and Fox, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter,
ca&s;t his eye upon him as one, who might be &s;erviceable
to him in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Antiq. Brit. Eccle&s;, p. 309. Polydore Virgil, lib. 27.</NOTE>. This prelate, ob&s;erving
that the earl of Surrey had totally eclip&s;ed him in favour,
re&s;olved to introduce Wol&s;ey into the young prince's fa|miliarity,
and hoped, that he might rival Surrey in his
in&s;inuating arts, and yet be contented to act in the ca|binet
a part &s;ubordinate to Fox him&s;elf, who had pro|moted
him. In a very little time, Wol&s;ey gained &s;o
much on Henry's good graces, that he &s;upplanted both
Surrey in his favour, and Fox in his tru&s;t and confidence.
Being admitted to the King's parties of plea&s;ure, he
took the lead in every jovial conver&s;ation, and pro|moted
all that frolic and entertainment, which he found
&s;uitable to the age and inclination of the young monarch.
Neither his own years, which were near forty, nor his
character of a clergyman, were any re&s;traint upon him,
or engaged him to check, by any u&s;ele&s;s &s;everity, the
gaiety, in which Henry, who had &s;mall propen&s;ion to
debauchery, pa&s;&s;ed his carele&s;s hours. During the in|tervals
of amu&s;ement he introduced bu&s;ine&s;s and &s;tate
affairs, and in&s;inuated tho&s;e maxims of conduct, which
he was de&s;irous his ma&s;ter &s;hould adopt. He ob&s;erved
to him, that, while he entru&s;ted his affairs into the hands
of his father's coun&s;ellors, he had the advantage indeed
of employing men of wi&s;dom and experience, but men who
owed not their promotion to his favour, and who &s;carce
<PB N="455" REF="481">
thought them&s;elves accountable to him for the exerci&s;e
of their authority: That by the factions, and cabals,
and jealou&s;ies, which prevailed among them, they more
ob&s;tructed the advancement of his affairs, than they
promoted it by the knowledge which age and practice
had conferred upon them: That while he thought pro|per
to pa&s;s his time in tho&s;e plea&s;ures, to which his age
and royal fortune invited him, and in tho&s;e &s;tudies,
which would in time enable him to &s;way the &s;ceptre
with ab&s;olute authority, his be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of government
would be to entru&s;t his authority into the hands of &s;ome
one per&s;on, who was the creature of his will, and who
could entertain no view but that of promoting his &s;er|vice:
And that if this mini&s;ter had al&s;o the &s;ame reli&s;h
for plea&s;ure with him&s;elf, and the &s;ame ta&s;te for
&s;cience;
he could the more ea&s;ily, at intervals, account to him
for his whole conduct, and introduce his ma&s;ter gradually
into the knowledge of public bu&s;ine&s;s, and thus, with|out
tedious con&s;traint or application, initiate him in the
&s;cience of government<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cavendi&s;h, p. 12. Stowe, p. 499.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENRY entered into all the views of Wol&s;ey; and
finding no one &s;o capable of executing this plan of ad|mini&s;tration
as the per&s;on who propo&s;ed it, he &s;oon ad|vanced
his favourite, from being the companion of his carele&s;s
hours, to be a member of his council; and from
being a member of his council, to be his &s;ole and ab&s;o|lute
mini&s;ter. By this rapid advancement and uncon|trouled
authority, the character and genius of Wol&s;ey
had full opportunity to di&s;play it&s;elf. In&s;atiable in his
acqui&s;itions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His charac|ter.</NOTE> but &s;till more magnificent in his expence:
Of exten&s;ive capacity, but &s;till more unbounded enter|prize:
Ambitious of power, but &s;till more de&s;irous of
<PB N="456" REF="482">
glory: In&s;inuating, engaging, per&s;ua&s;ive; and, by turns,
lofty, elevated, commanding: Haughty to his equals,
but affable to his dependants; oppre&s;&s;ive to the people,
but liberal to his friends; more generous than grateful;
le&s;s moved by injuries than by contempt; he &s;eemed
framed to take the a&s;cendant in every intercour&s;e with
others, but exerted this &s;uperiority of <HI>nature</HI> with &s;uch
o&s;tentation as expo&s;ed him to envy, and made every one
willing to recal the original inferiority or rather mean|ne&s;s
of his <HI>fortune.</HI></P>
<P>THE branch of admini&s;tration, in which Henry mo&s;t
exerted him&s;elf, while he gave his entire confidence to
Wol&s;ey, was the military, which, as it &s;uited the natu|ral
gallantry and bravery of his temper, as well as the
ardour of his youth, was the principal object of his at|tention.
Finding, that Lewis had made great prepara|tions
both by &s;ea and land to re&s;i&s;t him, he was no le&s;s
attentive to rai&s;e a formidable army and equip a con&s;i|derable
fleet for the inva&s;ion of France. The command
of the fleet was entru&s;ted to Sir Edward Howard; who,
after &s;couring the channel &s;ome time, pre&s;ented him&s;elf
before Bre&s;t, where the French navy then lay; and he
challenged them to a combat. The French admiral,
who expected from the Mediterranean a reinforcement
of &s;ome gallies under the command of Prejeant de Bi|doux,
kept within the harbour, and &s;aw with patience
the Engli&s;h burn and de&s;troy the country in the neigh|bourhood.
At la&s;t Prejeant arrived with &s;ix gallies, and
put into Conquet, a place within a few leagues of Bre&s;t,
where he &s;ecured him&s;elf behind &s;ome batteries, which
he had planted on rocks, that lay on each &s;ide of him.
Howard was notwith&s;tanding determined to make an
attack;<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th April.</NOTE> and as he had but two gallies, he took him&s;elf
the command of one, and gave the other to Devereux
lord Ferrars. He was followed by &s;ome row-barges
<PB N="457" REF="483">
and &s;ome crayers under the command of Sir Thomas
Cheyney, Sir William Sidney, and other officers of di|&s;tinction.
He immediately $a&s;tened on Prejeant's &s;hip,
and leaped on board of her, attended with one Carroz,
a Spani&s;h cavalier, and &s;eventeen Engli&s;hmen. The
cable, meanwhile, which fa&s;tened his &s;hip to that of the
enemy, being cut, the admiral was thus left in the hands
of the French; and as he &s;till continued the fight with
great gallantry, he was pu&s;hed overboard by their pikes<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">It was a maxim of Howard's, that no admiral was good for any thing, that was not brave even to a degree of madne&s;s. As the &s;ea-&s;ervice requires much le&s;s plan and contrivance and capacity than the land, this maxim has great plau&s;ibility and appearance of truth: Tho' the fate of Howard him&s;elf may &s;erve as a proof that even there courage ought to be tempered with di&s;cretion.</NOTE>.
Lord Ferrars, &s;eeing the admiral's galley fall off, fol|lowed
with the other ve&s;&s;els; and the whole fleet was &s;o
di&s;couraged by the lo&s;s of their admiral, that they re|tired
from before Bre&s;t<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Stowe, p. 491. Herbert, Holling&s;hed, p. 816.</NOTE>. The French navy came out
of harbour; and even ventured to invade the coa&s;t of
Su&s;&s;ex. They were repul&s;ed, and Prejeant, their ad|miral,
lo&s;t an eye by the &s;hot of an arrow. Lord How|ard,
brother to the decea&s;ed admiral, received the com|mand
of the Engli&s;h fleet; and little memorable pa&s;&s;ed
at &s;ea during this &s;ummer.</P>
<P>GREAT preparations had been making at land, dur|ing
the whole winter, for an inva&s;ion of France by the
way of Calais; but the &s;ummer was well advanced be|fore
every thing was in &s;ufficient readine&s;s for the in|tended
enterprize. The long peace, which the king|dom
had enjoyed, had &s;omewhat unfitted the Engli&s;h
for military expeditions; and the great change, which
had lately been introduced in the art of war, had ren|dered
<PB N="458" REF="484">
it &s;till more difficult to enure them to the u&s;e of
the weapons now employed in action. The Swi&s;s, and
after them the Spaniards, had &s;hown the advantage of
a &s;table infantry, who fought with pike and &s;word, and
were able to repul&s;e even the heavy-armed cavalry, in
which the great force of the armies formerly con&s;i&s;ted.
The practice of fire-arms was become very common;
Tho' the caliver, which was the weapon now u&s;ed, was
&s;o inconvenient, and attended with &s;o many di&s;advan|tages,
that it had not entirely di&s;credited the u&s;e of
bows, a weapon in which the Engli&s;h excelled all Eu|ropean
nations. The Engli&s;h archers &s;till maintained
their reputation; and even during the pre&s;ent reign, the
king's allies had &s;olicited him for &s;upplies of this kind.
The &s;econd year after his acce&s;&s;ion, he &s;ent a thou&s;and
archers, under the command of lord Dacres, to the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of Ferdinand, his father-in-law, in his project|ed
expedition again&s;t the Moors of Barbary; but as
that prince turned his arms again&s;t the French in Italy,
Darcy was &s;ent back, without being employed in any &s;ervice.
The King had al&s;o &s;ent fifteen hundred arch|ers
under the command of Sir Edward Poinings to the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Margaret, dutche&s;s of Savoy, who made
u&s;e of them with great advantage again&s;t the duke of
Guelders, the great di&s;turber of the Netherlands. A
considerable part of the forces, which Henry now le|vied
for the inva&s;ion of France, con&s;i&s;ted al&s;o of archers;
and &s;o &s;oon as affairs were in readine&s;s, the vanguard of
the army, amounting to 8000 men, under the com|mand
of the earl of Shrew&s;bury, &s;ailed over to Calais.
Shrew&s;bury was accompanied with the earl of Derby,
the lords Fitzwater, Ha&s;tings, Cobham, and Sir Rice
ap Thomas, captain of the light hor&s;e. Another body
of 6000 men &s;oon after followed under the command
<PB N="459" REF="485">
of lord Herbert, the chamberlain, attended with the
earls of Northumberland and Kent, the lords Audley
and Delawar, together with Carew, Cur&s;on, and other
gentlemen.</P>
<P>THE King him&s;elf prepared to follow with the main
body and rear of the army; and he appointed the queen
regent of the kingdom during his ab&s;ence. That he
might &s;ecure her administration from all di&s;turbance,
he ordered Edmond de la Pole, earl of Suffolk, to
be beheaded in the Tower, the nobleman who had
been attainted and impri&s;oned during the late reign.
The King was led to commit this act of violence
by the dying commands, as is imagined, of his fa|ther,
who told him, that he never would be free from
danger, while a man of &s;o turbulent a di&s;po&s;ition as Suf|folk
was alive. And as his brother, Richard de la Pole,
had accepted of a command in the French &s;ervice, and
attempted very fooli&s;hly to revive the York vaction, and
to animate them again&s;t Henry, he probably drew $ore
&s;uddenly the King's vengeance on the unhappy Suf|folk.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t, Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th June.</NOTE> attended with the duke of Bucking|ham
and many others of the nobility, arrived in Ca|lais,
and entered upon his French expedition, whence
he fondly expected &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s and glory<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Polydore Virgil, lib. 27. $elcarius, lib. 14.</NOTE>. Of all
tho&s;e allies, on who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he &s;o much relied, the
Swi&s;s alone fully performed their engagements. Be|ing
put in motion by a &s;um of money &s;ent them by
Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion of France.</NOTE> and incited by their victories obtained in Italy,
and by their animo&s;ity again&s;t France, they were pre|paring
to enter that kingdom with an army of twenty-five
thou&s;and men; and no equal force could be oppo&s;ed
<PB N="460" REF="486">
to their incur&s;ion. Maximilian had received an advance
of 120,000 crowns from Henry, and had engaged to
reinforce the Swi&s;s with 8000 men, but failed in his en|gagements.
That he might make atonement to the
King, he him&s;elf appeared in the Low Countries, and
joined the Engli&s;h army with &s;ome German and Fle|mi&s;h
&s;oldiers, who were u&s;eful in giving an example of
di&s;cipline to Henry's new-levied forces. Ob&s;erving the
di&s;po&s;ition of the Engli&s;h monarch to he more bent on
glory than on intere&s;t, he inli&s;ted him&s;elf in his &s;ervice,
wore the cro&s;s of St. George, and received pay, a hun|dred
crowns a day, as one of his &s;ubjects and captains.
But while he exhibited this extraordinary &s;pectacle, of
an emperor of Germany &s;erving under a King of Eng|land,
he was treated with the highe&s;t re&s;pect by Henry,
and really directed all the operations of the combined
army.</P>
<P>BEFORE the arrival of Henry and Maximilian in
the camp, the earl of Shrew&s;bury and lord Herbert had
formed the &s;iege of Tero&uuml;ane, a town &s;ituate on the
frontiers of Picardy; and they began to attack the place
with vigour. Teligini and Crequi commanded in the
town, and had a garri&s;on, which did not exceed a thou|&s;and
men; yet male they &s;uch &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance as pro|tracted
the &s;iege a month; and they found them&s;elves
at la&s;t more in danger from want of provi&s;ions and am|munition
than from the a&s;&s;aults of the be&s;iegers. Having
conveyed intelligence of their &s;ituation to Lewis, who
had advanced to Amiens with his army, that prince gave
orders to throw relief into the place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th Au|gu&s;t.</NOTE> Fontrailles appear|ed
at the head of 800 hor&s;emen, each of whom carried a
&s;ack of gun-powder behind him, and two quarters of bacon.
With this &s;mall force he made a &s;udden and unexpected
irruption into the Engli&s;h camp, and &s;urmounting all re|&s;i&s;tance,
<PB N="461" REF="487">
advanced to the fo&s;&s;ee of the town, where
each hor&s;eman, threw down his burthen. They imme|diately
returned at the gallop, and were &s;o fortunate as
again to break thro' the Engli&s;h, and to receive little or
no lo&s;s, in this dangerous attempt<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de Chev. Bayard, chap. 57. Memoires de Bellai.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the Engli&s;h had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Guinegate.</NOTE> &s;oon after, full revenge for that
in&s;ult. Henry had received intelligence of the approach
of the French hor&s;e, who had advanced to protect this
incur&s;ion of Fontrailles; and he ordered &s;ome troops to
pa&s;s the Lis, in order to oppo&s;e them. The cavalry of
France, tho' they con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of gentlemen, who
had behaved with great valour m many de&s;perate ac|tions
in Italy, were, on &s;ight of the enemy, &s;eized
with &s;o unaccountable a panic, that they immediately
took to flight, and were pur&s;ued by the Engli&s;h.
The duke of Longueville, who commanded the French, Bu&s;&s;i
d'Amboi&s;e, Clermont, Imbercourt, the chevalier Bay|ard,
and many other officers of di&s;tinction were taken
pri&s;oners<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Bellai, liv. 1. Polydore Virgil, lib. 27. Holling|&s;hed, p. 822, Herbert.</NOTE>. This action, or rather rout, is &s;ometimes
called the battle of Guinegate, from the place where
it was fought; but more commonly the <HI>Battle of Spurs,</HI>
becau&s;e the French, that day, made more u&s;e of their
&s;purs than of their &s;words or military weapons.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;o con&s;iderable an advantage, the King, who
was at the head of a compleat army of above 50,000
men, might have made incur&s;ions to the gates of Paris,
and &s;pread confu&s;ion and de&s;olation every where. It
gave Lewis great joy, when he heard, that the Engli&s;h,
in&s;tead of pu&s;hing their victory, and attacking the di&s;|mayed
troops of France, returned to the &s;iege of an in|con&s;iderable
place like Tero&uuml;ane. The governors were
<PB N="462" REF="488">
obliged &s;oon after to &s;urrender the town; and Henry
found his acqui&s;ition of &s;o little con&s;equenee, tho' gain|ed
at the expence of &s;ome blood, and what, in his pre|&s;ent
circum&s;tances, was more important, of much va|luable
time, that he immediately demoli&s;hed the fortifi|cations.
The anxieties of the French were again re|newed
with regard to the motions of the Engli&s;h. The
Swi&s;s at the &s;ame time had entered Burgundy with a very
formidable army, and laid &s;iege to Dijon, which was in
no condition to re&s;i&s;t them. Ferdinand him&s;elf, tho' he
had made a truce with Lewis, &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to lay
hold of every advantage which fortune &s;hould pre&s;ent to
him. Scarce over was the French monarchy in greater
danger, or le&s;s in a condition to defend it&s;elf again&s;t
tho&s;e powerful armies, which on every &s;ide a&s;&s;ailed or
threatened it. Even many of the inhabitants of Paris,
who believed them&s;elves expo&s;ed to the rapacity and
violence of the enemy, began to di&s;lodge, without
knowing what place could afford them greater &s;afety and
protection.</P>
<P>BUT Lewis was extricated from his pre&s;ent difficulties
by the manife&s;t blunders of his enemies. The Swi&s;s
allowed them&s;elves to be &s;educed into a negotiation by
Tremo&uuml;ille, governor of Burgundy; and without mak|ing
enquiry, whether that nobleman had any powers to
treat, they accepted of the conditions which he offered
them. Tremo&uuml;ille, who knew, that he &s;hould be di&s;|avowed
by his ma&s;ter, &s;tipulated whatever they were
plea&s;ed to demand; and thought him&s;elf happy, at the
expence of &s;ome payments, and very large promi&s;es, to
get rid of &s;o formidable an enemy<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Memoires du mare&s;chal de Fleuranges, Beliarius, lib. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE mea&s;ures of Henry &s;howed equal ignorance in
the art of war with that of the Swi&s;s in negotiation.
<PB N="463" REF="489">
Tournay was a great and rich city, which, tho' it lay
within the frontiers of Flanders, belonged entirely to
France, and afforded the troops of that kingdom a pa&s;&s;age
into the middle of the Netherlands. Maximilian, who
was de&s;irous to free his grand&s;on from &s;o trouble&s;ome a
neighbourhood, advi&s;ed Henry to lay &s;iege to this place;
and the Engli&s;h monarch, not con&s;idering that &s;uch an
acqui&s;ition nowi&s;e advanced his conque&s;ts in France,
was &s;o imprudent as to follow this intere&s;ted council.
The city of Tournay, by its antient charters, being ex|empted
from the burthen of a garri&s;on, the burghers,
even again&s;t the remon&s;trance of their &s;overeign, &s;tre|nuou&s;ly
in&s;i&s;ted on maintaining this dangerous privilege;
and they engaged, by them&s;elves, to make a vigorous de|fence
again&s;t the enemy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Memories de Fleuranges.</NOTE>. Their courage failed them
when matters came to extremity; and after a few days
&s;iege, the place was &s;urrendered to the Engli&s;h.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th Sep|tember.</NOTE> Henry
&s;o little regarded its privileges, that he immediately quar|tered
a garri&s;on in it, under the command of Sir Ed|ward
Poinings. The bi&s;hop of Tournay was lately
dead; and as a new bi&s;hop was already elected by the
chapter, but not installed in his office, the King be|&s;towed
the admini&s;tration of the &s;ee on his favourite,
Wol&s;ey, and put him in immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the re|venues,
which were con&s;iderable<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Strype's Memorials, vol. i. p. 5, 6.</NOTE>. Hearing of the re|treat
of the Swi&s;s, and ob&s;erving the &s;ea&s;on to be far
advanced, he thought proper to retire into England;
and he carried the greate&s;t part of his army with him.
Succe&s;s had attended him in every enterprize; and his
youthful mind was much elated with this &s;eeming pro|&s;perity;
but all men of judgment, comparing the ad|vantages
of his &s;ituation with his progress, his expences
<PB N="464" REF="490">
with his acqui&s;itions, were convinced, that this campaign,
&s;o much vaunted, was, in reality, both ruinous and in|glorious
to him<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s, which, during this &s;ummer, had attended
Henry's arms in the North, was much more deci&s;ive.
The King of Scotland had &s;ummoned out the whole
force of his kingdom; and having pa&s;&s;ed the Tweed with
a brave, tho' a tumultuary army of above 50,000 men,
he ravaged tho&s;e parts of Northumberland which lay
neare&s;t that river, and employed him&s;elf in taking the
ca&s;tles of Norham, Etal, Werke, Ford, and other places
of little importance. The lady Ford, a woman of great
beauty, being taken pri&s;oner in her ca&s;tle, was pre&s;ented
to James, and &s;o gained on the affections of that mo|narch,
that he wa&s;ted in idle plea&s;ure that critical time,
which, during the ab&s;ence of his enemy, he &s;hould have
employed in pu&s;hing his conque&s;ts. His troops, lying
in a barren country, where they &s;oon con&s;umed all the
provi&s;ions, began to be pinched with nece&s;&s;ity; and as
the authority of the prince was feeble, and military di&s;|cipline,
during that age, extremely relaxed, many of
them had &s;tolen from the camp, and retired homewards.
Meanwhile, the earl of Surrey, having collected a force
of 26,000 men, of which 5000 had been &s;ent over from
the King's army in France, marched to the defence of
the country, and approached the Scots, who lay on &s;ome
high ground near the hills of Cheviot. The river Till
ran between the armies, and prevented an engagement:
Surrey therefore &s;ent a herald to the Scots camp, chal|lenging
the enemy to de&s;cend into the plain of Milfield,
which lay towards the &s;outh; and there, appointing a
day for the combat, try their valour on equal ground.
<PB N="465" REF="491">
As he received no &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, he made a feint of
marching towards Berwic; as if he intended to enter
Scotland, to lay wa&s;te the borders, and cut off the pro|vi&s;ions
of the enemy. The Scots army, in order to pre|vent
his purpo&s;e, put them&s;elves in motion; and having
&s;et fire to the huts in which they had quartered, they
de&s;cended from the hills. Surrey, taking advantage of
the &s;moke, which was blown towards him, and which
covered his movements, pa&s;&s;ed the Till with his artillery
and vanguard at the bridge of Twi&s;el, and &s;ent the re&s;t
of his army to find a ford farther up the river.</P>
<P>AN engagement was now become inevitable between
the armies, and both &s;ides prepared for it with great
tranquillity and order<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Buchannan, lib. 13. Drummond. Herbert. Polydore Virgil, lib. 27. Stowe, p. 493. Paullus Jovius.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th Sep|tember.</NOTE>. The Engli&s;h divided their
army into two lines: Lord Howard led the main body
of the fir&s;t line, Sir Edmond Howard the right wing,
Sir Marmaduke Con&s;table the left. The earl of Surrey
him&s;elf commanded the main body of the &s;econd line,
lord Dacres the right wing, Sir Edward Stanley the left.
The Scots front pre&s;ented three divi&s;ions to the enemy:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Flouden.</NOTE> The middle was led by the King him&s;elf; The right by
the earl of Huntley, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by lord Hume: The left by
the earls of Lenox and Argyle. A fourth divi&s;ion un|der
the earl of Bothwel made a body of re&s;erve. Hunt|ley
began the battle; and after a &s;harp conflict, put
to flight the left wing of the Engli&s;h, and chaced them
off the field: But on returning from the pur&s;uit, he
found the whole Scots army in great di&s;order. The di|vi&s;ion
under Lenox and Argyle, elated with the &s;ucce&s;s
of the other wing, had broke their ranks, and notwith|&s;tanding
the remon&s;trances and entreaties of La Motte,

the French amba&s;&s;ador, had ru&s;hed headlong upon the
enemy. Not only Sir Edmond Howard, at the head
of his divi&s;ion, received them with great valour; but
Dacres, who commanded in the &s;econd line, wheeling
about during the action, fell upon their rear, and put
them to the &s;word without re&s;i&s;tance. The divi&s;ion un|der
the King him&s;elf and that under Bothwel, animated
by the valour of their leaders, &s;till made head again&s;t
the Engli&s;h, and throwing them&s;elves into a circle, pro|tracted
the action till night &s;eparated the combatants.
The victory &s;eemed yet uncertain, and the numbers
which fell on each fide were nearly equal, amounting to
above 5000 men: But the morning di&s;covered evidently
where the advantage lay. The Engli&s;h had lo&s;t only
per&s;ons of &s;mall note; but the flower of the Scots no|bility
had fallen in battle, and the King him&s;elf, after
the mo&s;t diligent enquiry, could no where be found. In
&s;earching the field, the Engli&s;h met with a dead body,
which re&s;embled him, and was arrayed in a &s;imilar habit;
and they put it in a leaden coffin, and &s;ent it to Lon|don.
During &s;ome time it was kept unburied; becau&s;e
James died under &s;entence of excommunication, on ac|count
of his confederacy with France, and his oppo&s;i|tion
to the holy &s;ee<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Buchannan, lib. 13. Herbert.</NOTE>: But upon Henry's application,
who pretended that that prince, in the in&s;tant before his
death, had di&s;covered &s;igns of repentance, ab&s;olution
was given him, and his body was interred. The Scots,
however, &s;till a&s;&s;erted, that it was not James's body, which
was found in the field of battle, but that of one Elphin&s;ton,
who had been arrayed in arms re&s;embling the King's, in
order to divide the attention of the Engli&s;h, and &s;hare
the danger with his ma&s;ter. It was believed that James
had been &s;een cro&s;&s;ing the Tweed at Kel&s;o; and &s;ome
<PB N="467" REF="495">
imagined that he had been killed by the va&s;&s;als of lord
Hume, whom that nobleman had in&s;tigated to commit
&s;o enormous a crime. But the, populace entertained the
opinion that he was &s;till alive, and having gone &s;ecretly
in pilgrimage to the holy land, would &s;oon return, and
take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne. This fond conceit was
long entertained in Scotland.</P>
<P>THE King of Scots and mo&s;t of the chief nobility
being killed in the field of Flouden, &s;o this battle was
called, a very inviting opportunity was offered to Henry
of gaining advantages over that kingdom, perhaps of
reducing it to &s;ubjection. But he di&s;covered on this
occa&s;ion a mind truly great and generous. When the
Queen of Scotland, Margaret, who was created regent
during the infancy of her &s;on, applied for peace, he
readily granted it; and took compa&s;&s;ion of the helple&s;s
condition of his &s;i&s;ter and nephew. The earl of Surrey,
who had gained him &s;o great a victory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1514.</NOTE> he re&s;tored to the
title of duke of Norfolk, which had been forfeited by his
father, for engaging on the &s;ide of Richard the third.
His &s;on, lord Howard, was honoured with the title of
earl of Surrey. Sir Charles Brandon, his favourite, whom
he had before created vi&s;count Li&s;le, was now rai&s;ed to
the dignity of duke of Suffolk. Wol&s;ey, who was both
his favourite and his mini&s;ter, was created bi&s;hop of Lin|coln.
Lord Herbert obtained the title of earl of Wor|ce&s;ter.
Sir Edward Stanley, that of lord Monteagle.</P>
<P>THO' peace with Scotland gave Henry &s;ecurity towards
the North, and enabled him to pro&s;ecute in tranquillity
his enterprise againi&s;t France, &s;ome other incidents had
happened, which more than counterbalanced this fortu|nate
event, and &s;erved to open his eyes with regard to the
ra&s;hne&s;s of an undertaking, into which his youth and
high fortune had betrayed him.</P>
<P><PB N="468" REF="496">
LEWIS, fully &s;en&s;ible of the dangerous &s;ituation to
which his kingdom had been reduced during the former
campaign, was re&s;olved, by every expedient, to prevent
the return of like perils, and to break the confederacy of
his enemies. The Pope was nowi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed to pu&s;h the
French to extremity; and provided they did not return
to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Milan, his intere&s;t rather led him
to pre&s;erve the balance among the contending parties.
He accepted, therefore, of Lewis's offer to renounce
the council of Lyons; and he took off the excommuni|cation
which his predece&s;&s;or and him&s;elf had denounced
again&s;t that King and his kingdom. Ferdinand was now
fa&s;t declining in years, and as he entertained no farther
ambition than that of keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Navarre,
which he had &s;ubdued by his arms and policy, he rea|dily
hearkened to the propo&s;als of Lewis for prolonging
the truce mother year; and he even &s;howed an inclina|tion
of forming a more intimate connexion with that
monarch. Lewis had dropt hints of his intention to
marry his second daughter Ren&eacute;e, either to Charles, prince
of Spain, or his brother, Ferdinand, both of them grand|children
to the Spani&s;h monarch; and he declared his
re&s;olution of be&s;towing on her, as her portion, his claim
to the dutchy of Milan. Ferdinand not only embraced
the&s;e &s;chemes with avidity&punc; but al&s;o engaged the em|peror,
Maximilian, in the &s;ame views, and procured his
con&s;ent to a treaty, which opened &s;o inviting a pro&s;pect
of aggrandizing their common grandchildren.</P>
<P>WHEN Henry was informed of Ferdinand's renewal
of the truce with Lewis, he fell into the mo&s;t violent
rage, and loudly complained, that his father-in-law had
fir&s;t, by the highe&s;t promi&s;es and profe&s;&s;ions, engaged
him in enmity with France, and afterwards, without
giving him the lea&s;t warning, had now again &s;acrificed
<PB N="469" REF="497">
his intere&s;t to his own &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es, and had left him
expo&s;ed alone to all the dangers and expences of the
war. In proportion to his ea&s;y credulity and un&s;u&s;pect|ing
reliance on Ferdinand was the vehemence with which
he exclaimed again&s;t the treatment, which he met with;
and he threatened revenge for this egregious treachery
and breach of faith<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Petrus de Angleria, Epi&s;t. 545, 546.</NOTE>. But he lo&s;t all patience when
informed of the other negotiation, by which Maximilian
was al&s;o &s;educed from his alliance, and where propo&s;als
had been hearkened to, for the marriage of the prince of
Spain with the daughter of France. Charles, during the
lifetime of the late King, had been affianced to Mary,
Henry's &s;econd &s;i&s;ter; and as the prince now approached
the age of puberty, the King had expected the immedi|ate
completion of the marriage, and the honourable
&s;ettlement of a &s;i&s;ter, for whom he had entertained a very
tender affection. Such a complication, therefore, of in|juries
gave him the highe&s;t: di&s;plea&s;ure, and in&s;pired him
with a de&s;ire of expre&s;&s;ing his di&s;dain towards tho&s;e who
had taken advantage of his youth and inexperience, and
had abu&s;ed his too great facility.</P>
<P>THE duke of Longueville, who had been made pri|&s;oner
at the battle of Guinegate, and who was &s;till de|$ained
in England, was ready to take advantage of all
the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions of Henry, in order to procure a peace
and even an alliance, which he knew to be &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately
de&s;ired by his ma&s;ter. He repre&s;ented to the King, that
Anne, Queen of France, being lately dead, a door was
thereby opened for an affinity, which might tend to the
advantage of both kingdoms, and which would &s;erve to
terminate honourably all the differences between them&punc;
That &s;he had left Lewis no male children; and as he
<PB N="470" REF="498">
had ever entertained a &s;trong de&s;ire of having heirs to
the crown, no marriage &s;eemed more &s;uitable to him
than that with the prince&s;s of England, who&s;e youth and
beauty afforded the mo&s;t flattering hopes in that parti|cular:
That tho' the marriage of a prince&s;s of &s;ixteen,
with a King of fifty-three, might &s;eem un&s;uitable; yet
the other advantages, attending the alliance, were more
than a &s;ufficient compen&s;ation for this inequality: And
that Henry, in loo&s;ening his connections with Spain,
whence he had never experienced any advantage, would
contract a clo&s;e affinity with Lewis, a prince, who thro'
his whole life, had invariably maintained the character of probity and honour.</P>
<P>AS Henry &s;eemed to hearken to this di&s;cour&s;e with very
willing ears, Longueville informed his ma&s;ter of the pro|bability,
which he di&s;covered, of bringing this matter to
a happy conclu&s;ion; and he received full powers for ne|gotiating
the treaty. The articles were ea&s;ily adjusted
between the monarchs. Lewis agreed that Tournay
&s;hould remain in the hands of the Engli&s;h;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with France. 7th of Au|gu&s;t.</NOTE> that Richard
de la Pole &s;hould be bani&s;hed to Metz, there to live on
a pen&s;ion a&s;&s;igned him by Lewis; that Henry &s;hould re|ceive
payment of a million of crowns, being the arrears
due by treaty to his father and him&s;elf; and that the
prince&s;s Mary &s;hould bring four hundred thou&s;and crowns
as her portion, and enjoy as large a jointure as any
queen of France, even the former, who was heire&s;s of Britanny.
The two princes al&s;o &s;tipulated the &s;uccours,
with which they &s;hould mutually &s;upply each other, in
ca&s;e either of them was attacked by any enemy<NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot">Du. Tillet.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of this treaty, Mary was &s;ent over to
France with a &s;plendid retinue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of Oc|tober.</NOTE> and Lewis met her at
Abbeville, where the e&s;pou&s;als were celebrated. He
<PB N="471" REF="499">
was enchanted with the beauty, grace, and numerous
accompli&s;hments of the young prince&s;s; and being na|turally
of an amorous di&s;po&s;ition, which his advanced
age had not entirely cooled, he was &s;educed into &s;uch a
cour&s;e of gaiety and plea&s;ure, as proved very un&s;uitable
to his declining &s;tate of health<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Brantome Eloge de Louis XII.</NOTE>. He died in le&s;s than
three months after his marriage, to the infinite regret of
his &s;ubjects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t of Ja|nuary.</NOTE> who, &s;en&s;ible of his tender concern for their
welfare, gave him with one voice the honourable appel|lation
of <HI>father of his people.</HI></P>
<P>FRANCIS, duke of Angouleme, a youth of one and
twenty, who had married Lewis's elde&s;t daughter, &s;uc|ceeded
him on the throne; and by his activity, valour,
genero&s;ity, and other virtues, gave progno&s;tics of a
happy and glorious reign. This young monarch had
been extremely &s;truck with the charms of the Engli&s;h
prince&s;s; and even during his predece&s;&s;or's life-time, had
payed her &s;uch clo&s;e attendance as made &s;ome of his
friends apprehend that he had entertained views of
gallantry towards her. But being warned, that, by in|dulging
him&s;elf in this pa&s;&s;ion, he might readily exclude
his own title to the throne, he forbore all farther ad|dre&s;&s;es;
and even watched the young dowager with a
very careful eye during the fir&s;t months of her widow|hood.
Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, was at that
time in the court of France, the mo&s;t comely per&s;onage
of his time, and $he mo&s;t accompli&s;hed in all the exer|ci&s;es,
which were then thought to befit a courtier and
a &s;oldier. He was Henry's chief favourite; and that
monarch had even once entertained thoughts of marry|ing
him to his &s;i&s;ter, and had given indulgence to that
mutual pa&s;&s;ion, which took place between them. The
<PB N="472" REF="500">
queen a&s;ked Suffolk whether he had now the courage,
without farther reflection, to e&s;pou&s;e her; and &s;he told
him, that her brother would more ea&s;ily forgive him for
not a&s;king his con&s;ent, than for acting contrary to his
orders. Suffolk, declined not &s;o inviting an offer; and
the marriage was &s;ecretly compleated at Paris. Francis,
who was plea&s;ed with this marriage, as it prevented
Henry from forming any powerful alliance by means of
his &s;i&s;ter<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Petrus de Angleria, Epi&s;t. 544.</NOTE>, interpo&s;ed his good offices in appea&s;ing him:
And even Wol&s;ey, having entertained no jealou&s;y of
Suffolk, who was content to participate in the King's
